[00:14.520 --> 00:17.160]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:17.160 --> 00:19.080]  It's time for episode number 247
[00:19.080 --> 00:20.960]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:20.960 --> 00:24.920]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.920 --> 00:26.000]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.200]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.780]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.780 --> 00:31.800]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:31.800 --> 00:34.540]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.540 --> 00:37.600]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.600 --> 00:39.520]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.520 --> 00:41.360]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.360 --> 00:43.520]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.520 --> 00:45.160]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.160 --> 00:47.640]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.640 --> 00:49.400]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:49.400 --> 00:51.520]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.680 --> 00:55.300]  Once again, welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55.300 --> 00:58.600]  I am coming to you on a rainy Thursday evening.
[00:58.600 --> 01:00.480]  That's right, it has been raining in Southern Colorado
[01:00.480 --> 01:02.240]  for several days now,
[01:02.240 --> 01:04.640]  and it does not show any sign of letting up.
[01:05.800 --> 01:07.640]  If you've got an outdoor crop in Southern Colorado,
[01:07.640 --> 01:09.600]  you are working for your money this year.
[01:09.600 --> 01:11.800]  It is not gonna be a simple grow.
[01:12.640 --> 01:14.960]  A lot of folks are gonna get powdery mildew.
[01:14.960 --> 01:16.400]  A lot of folks are gonna get bud rot.
[01:16.400 --> 01:18.320]  A lot of crops are just gonna get simply destroyed
[01:18.320 --> 01:20.520]  by the hail, by the rain, by all the moisture.
[01:20.520 --> 01:22.320]  I hope everything goes well for everybody.
[01:22.320 --> 01:25.320]  If you are an outdoor grower in Southern Colorado,
[01:25.320 --> 01:27.240]  I send my love and my respect.
[01:27.240 --> 01:28.960]  I hope everything goes your way.
[01:28.960 --> 01:30.480]  If you're an outdoor grower anywhere,
[01:30.480 --> 01:31.320]  I send love and respect,
[01:31.320 --> 01:32.440]  but the people in Colorado are getting
[01:32.440 --> 01:34.400]  a damn challenge this year.
[01:34.400 --> 01:35.240]  Good luck out there.
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.080]  There may be a shortage in cannabis available
[01:37.080 --> 01:37.920]  at the end of the season.
[01:37.920 --> 01:40.280]  We may not get the harvests we are anticipating
[01:40.320 --> 01:41.800]  from the outdoor grows
[01:41.800 --> 01:43.240]  because of all this fucked up weather.
[01:43.240 --> 01:44.080]  Good luck, you guys.
[01:44.080 --> 01:46.440]  I hope it doesn't ruin anybody's Christmas plans.
[01:46.440 --> 01:47.440]  Good luck out there.
[01:48.760 --> 01:49.760]  All right, when I start the show,
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.520]  I usually like to talk about what I'm dabbing on.
[01:51.520 --> 01:54.960]  Today, I am dabbing on some Star Dog Dubwise
[01:54.960 --> 01:56.720]  that I picked up from Three Rivers.
[01:56.720 --> 01:57.720]  That's right.
[01:57.720 --> 01:59.760]  If you don't know, I am the lead cultivator,
[01:59.760 --> 02:00.880]  the grow manager.
[02:00.880 --> 02:03.600]  I'm the dude over at Three Rivers Cultivation.
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.980]  I run that grow over there.
[02:04.980 --> 02:07.880]  So to smoke some concentrates that was grown in my garden
[02:07.880 --> 02:09.720]  by myself and my grow team,
[02:10.160 --> 02:11.000]  it puts a little smile on my face.
[02:11.000 --> 02:12.720]  The Star Dog Dubwise is a great combo.
[02:12.720 --> 02:14.880]  This of course was extracted by our friends
[02:14.880 --> 02:16.240]  at Concentrate Supply Company.
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.080]  Big shout out.
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.120]  They did a great job.
[02:18.120 --> 02:19.360]  The taste is amazing.
[02:20.240 --> 02:21.760]  And the high is incredible.
[02:21.760 --> 02:24.960]  I had to do like three retakes on the damn intro
[02:24.960 --> 02:26.000]  because of this shatter.
[02:26.000 --> 02:27.480]  That's how high I got from it.
[02:27.480 --> 02:30.200]  Super tasty and it made me a little bit goofy.
[02:30.200 --> 02:32.240]  And apparently, it's got me a little bit rambly.
[02:32.240 --> 02:35.680]  So shout out to my friends at Concentrate Supply Company.
[02:35.680 --> 02:37.640]  Great work with the material we gave you.
[02:37.640 --> 02:38.480]  Good job.
[02:40.520 --> 02:41.720]  All right, it's probably old news
[02:41.720 --> 02:43.080]  by the time this episode comes out,
[02:43.080 --> 02:46.000]  but yesterday, Mr. Hugh Hefner passed away.
[02:46.000 --> 02:47.360]  Shout out to Mr. Hugh Hefner,
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.220]  the man behind Playboy Magazine.
[02:50.080 --> 02:52.400]  Even if you're just reading the articles,
[02:52.400 --> 02:54.680]  I'm sure everyone has taken a peek into a Playboy Magazine
[02:54.680 --> 02:56.960]  and then found something that got their attention.
[02:56.960 --> 02:58.240]  There weren't just dirty pictures, you guys.
[02:58.240 --> 02:59.080]  There were jokes in there.
[02:59.080 --> 03:02.380]  Some of my favorite jokes were from old Playboy Magazines.
[03:02.380 --> 03:04.380]  In fact, I just thought of one as I was saying that.
[03:04.380 --> 03:06.980]  There was a picture of a guy in a Batman costume
[03:06.980 --> 03:08.580]  and a beautiful girl who looked,
[03:08.780 --> 03:10.020]  it was a drawing, it was a cartoon.
[03:10.020 --> 03:11.460]  So it was an animation.
[03:11.460 --> 03:12.820]  And this is from when I was a little kid
[03:12.820 --> 03:14.500]  is when I discovered this.
[03:14.500 --> 03:16.580]  There was a man in a Batman costume
[03:16.580 --> 03:17.900]  and he had his wiener out
[03:17.900 --> 03:19.880]  and there's a woman next to him and she was really pretty
[03:19.880 --> 03:20.780]  and she was sitting on the bed
[03:20.780 --> 03:22.300]  with a really disappointed look.
[03:22.300 --> 03:23.700]  And the caption said,
[03:23.700 --> 03:24.740]  what did you expect?
[03:24.740 --> 03:26.100]  It's a bat dick.
[03:26.100 --> 03:27.600]  That might've been the first meme.
[03:27.600 --> 03:29.300]  That may have been a meme back in the day
[03:29.300 --> 03:30.860]  before memes were memes.
[03:30.860 --> 03:32.820]  But anyhow, shout out to Mr. Hugh Hefner.
[03:32.820 --> 03:35.420]  Somebody said that Hugh Hefner has gone on to a better place
[03:35.420 --> 03:36.860]  that he is in heaven.
[03:36.860 --> 03:38.060]  Are you fucking sure?
[03:38.060 --> 03:39.820]  When you're Hugh Hefner, what's next?
[03:39.820 --> 03:40.900]  What is better than that?
[03:40.900 --> 03:42.220]  What is heaven?
[03:42.220 --> 03:43.580]  Right?
[03:43.580 --> 03:45.540]  All right, let's move forward a little bit with the podcast.
[03:45.540 --> 03:47.060]  You guys, let's get serious.
[03:48.020 --> 03:49.260]  I've got a bunch of great emails.
[03:49.260 --> 03:50.500]  I'm gonna turn this music down a little bit
[03:50.500 --> 03:52.820]  and we are going to get right into
[03:52.820 --> 03:56.700]  the first email of the podcast.
[03:56.700 --> 03:58.060]  Of course, if you'd like to send me an email
[03:58.060 --> 03:59.620]  to be read on the show, it's really easy.
[03:59.620 --> 04:03.900]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[04:03.900 --> 04:05.300]  That's the best way to reach me.
[04:05.300 --> 04:08.020]  I will do my best to respond to your email on the show.
[04:08.860 --> 04:09.860]  I do get a lot of emails.
[04:09.860 --> 04:11.740]  I am working my way through the stack of emails.
[04:11.740 --> 04:13.260]  If I haven't gotten to yours yet,
[04:13.260 --> 04:14.980]  keep listening, please be patient.
[04:14.980 --> 04:16.780]  I will do my best to get to it.
[04:16.780 --> 04:18.420]  Some questions are seasonal,
[04:18.420 --> 04:19.780]  some are going along with other things
[04:19.780 --> 04:21.340]  I'm already thinking about talking about.
[04:21.340 --> 04:23.340]  So it's just timing it and getting to yours.
[04:23.340 --> 04:24.260]  It will happen.
[04:24.260 --> 04:25.900]  Keep listening, stay tuned.
[04:25.900 --> 04:28.660]  So this first email goes like this.
[04:28.660 --> 04:30.660]  It says, Rasta Jeff, what is up my brother?
[04:30.660 --> 04:31.660]  About a month in discovering
[04:31.660 --> 04:34.100]  your wonderfully refreshing show.
[04:34.100 --> 04:37.660]  It is so nice to have a mix of culture, music, laughs,
[04:38.300 --> 04:39.700]  and of course, growing cannabis.
[04:39.700 --> 04:41.940]  Your show sails away my day
[04:41.940 --> 04:44.660]  as I slave away in the wonderful world of construction.
[04:44.660 --> 04:46.260]  I've been binging on the past episodes
[04:46.260 --> 04:48.780]  as well as the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[04:48.780 --> 04:50.300]  Just to, if you're not familiar,
[04:50.300 --> 04:52.860]  every Thursday I put out a Throwback Thursday episode.
[04:52.860 --> 04:55.140]  I am at episode 247.
[04:55.140 --> 04:59.220]  iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes in most feeds.
[04:59.220 --> 05:02.900]  So 147 episodes are not available.
[05:02.900 --> 05:04.780]  I've been putting those in chunks
[05:04.780 --> 05:06.140]  of like three to five episodes
[05:06.140 --> 05:07.820]  and releasing those on Thursdays
[05:07.820 --> 05:10.140]  so that the old episodes are back in the feed.
[05:10.140 --> 05:11.380]  Once I get caught up,
[05:11.380 --> 05:14.020]  I'll just stop doing the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[05:14.020 --> 05:17.220]  But also I'm putting all of the old episodes up on YouTube.
[05:17.220 --> 05:19.940]  YouTube does not limit how much content I provide.
[05:19.940 --> 05:22.460]  So I can get every episode up on YouTube.
[05:22.460 --> 05:24.740]  Make sure you check out the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[05:24.740 --> 05:26.260]  Make sure you check out the YouTube channel.
[05:26.260 --> 05:28.460]  All of the old stuff will be archived there.
[05:29.740 --> 05:31.140]  So thanks for listening to the Thursday stuff.
[05:31.140 --> 05:32.380]  It's good to know people are listening
[05:32.380 --> 05:33.700]  because that takes a lot of time
[05:33.700 --> 05:36.020]  to put together a three hour episode.
[05:36.780 --> 05:37.620]  The email goes on to say,
[05:37.620 --> 05:38.780]  your knowledge as well as the many guests
[05:38.780 --> 05:42.140]  from the cannabis culture can impart much knowledge.
[05:42.140 --> 05:45.260]  For that reason, I need a little advice.
[05:45.260 --> 05:46.780]  A little background on myself.
[05:46.780 --> 05:48.700]  I'm from the South, Prohibition Land.
[05:48.700 --> 05:50.700]  My wife and I are very progressive thinkers,
[05:50.700 --> 05:53.580]  use cannabis regularly, mildly successful,
[05:53.580 --> 05:56.060]  parents most of all, and we plan on heading west
[05:56.060 --> 05:58.500]  within the next couple of years to relocate.
[05:58.500 --> 06:01.100]  My home will likely be one of the last states
[06:01.100 --> 06:03.780]  to show any progression towards legalization.
[06:03.780 --> 06:04.620]  With that being said,
[06:04.620 --> 06:06.660]  my heart is just simply in the culture.
[06:06.660 --> 06:08.220]  It's my dream to better this culture
[06:08.220 --> 06:10.860]  and one day contribute in some meaningful manner.
[06:10.860 --> 06:13.820]  So my family is planning on liquidating our assets here,
[06:13.820 --> 06:15.860]  sub-plant where the laws are more favorable,
[06:15.860 --> 06:17.420]  and restart our lives.
[06:17.420 --> 06:19.340]  Honestly, the biggest part of this decision
[06:19.340 --> 06:21.900]  is the desire to experience a culture
[06:21.900 --> 06:23.620]  that is more like my own ideals,
[06:23.620 --> 06:27.140]  as well as raise my children in a place with open minds.
[06:27.140 --> 06:28.980]  I plan on using my professional experience
[06:28.980 --> 06:30.700]  to gain employment in our new home
[06:30.700 --> 06:32.660]  and then attempt to enter the cannabis industry
[06:32.660 --> 06:34.220]  any way I can.
[06:34.220 --> 06:36.460]  Before you decide to pack up and leave,
[06:36.460 --> 06:38.260]  make sure you can get an MED badge
[06:38.260 --> 06:39.420]  in the state of Colorado
[06:39.420 --> 06:41.080]  before you even consider coming here,
[06:41.080 --> 06:42.660]  because if you cannot get that,
[06:42.660 --> 06:45.540]  you cannot work in the Colorado marijuana industry.
[06:45.540 --> 06:47.980]  Just a heads up, that kinda screws a lot of people.
[06:47.980 --> 06:49.100]  I don't know your background,
[06:49.100 --> 06:51.180]  I'm just giving you a heads up.
[06:51.180 --> 06:52.940]  Let me find my spot in the email.
[06:52.940 --> 06:55.440]  He says, at least that way I can support my family
[06:55.440 --> 06:57.360]  and not be unrealistic in the time it takes
[06:57.360 --> 06:59.380]  to get into the business.
[06:59.380 --> 07:01.580]  I digress, that is where I am.
[07:01.580 --> 07:04.260]  Feel free to give any advice on that matter.
[07:04.260 --> 07:06.220]  Ah, man, so far sounds like a great idea.
[07:06.220 --> 07:10.180]  You wanna go somewhere where you can freely use cannabis,
[07:10.180 --> 07:11.620]  where you don't have to hide your cannabis,
[07:11.620 --> 07:12.860]  you don't have to be a criminal
[07:12.860 --> 07:15.520]  because of a plant of a thing that you enjoy.
[07:15.520 --> 07:18.180]  I get it, I encourage that.
[07:18.180 --> 07:20.260]  The only thing you have to look for before you do it
[07:20.260 --> 07:21.740]  is make sure you can get that badge.
[07:21.740 --> 07:24.220]  Don't move out here with hopes of getting into the industry
[07:24.220 --> 07:25.660]  and then not being able to get that badge.
[07:25.660 --> 07:27.660]  It sounds like you have other employment options,
[07:27.660 --> 07:28.920]  which is great.
[07:28.920 --> 07:30.820]  Maybe find an ancillary business or something
[07:30.860 --> 07:32.180]  to align yourself with,
[07:32.180 --> 07:34.740]  and then you can work yourself into the industry that way.
[07:34.740 --> 07:36.700]  I'm gonna continue with the email.
[07:36.700 --> 07:39.600]  It says, the question I have is about kids.
[07:39.600 --> 07:41.860]  How do I explain all of this craziness to them
[07:41.860 --> 07:45.260]  when anti-weed propaganda is coming from every direction?
[07:45.260 --> 07:47.540]  My preteen point blank asked my wife and I
[07:47.540 --> 07:49.100]  if we smoke weed.
[07:49.100 --> 07:50.780]  This happened just the other night.
[07:50.780 --> 07:52.980]  My wife and I were flabbergasted.
[07:52.980 --> 07:54.620]  He said that kids at school and Dere
[07:54.620 --> 07:55.920]  had explained all about it.
[07:55.920 --> 07:57.380]  He stated that all of his knowledge
[07:57.380 --> 07:59.180]  was negative regarding the matter.
[07:59.180 --> 08:00.660]  He suspected that we do.
[08:01.500 --> 08:02.620]  We do, yes, but we are very discreet
[08:02.620 --> 08:04.540]  considering the laws in our area.
[08:04.540 --> 08:05.820]  My kids are my everything,
[08:05.820 --> 08:08.260]  so I was morally conflicted with this question.
[08:08.260 --> 08:10.140]  It's illegal, so I wanted to say no,
[08:10.140 --> 08:13.300]  but my home is an open door policy and he is growing up.
[08:13.300 --> 08:15.100]  My wife and I explained that we use cannabis
[08:15.100 --> 08:17.320]  for medical reasons and that we plan on moving
[08:17.320 --> 08:19.780]  to an area that poses no legal issues.
[08:19.780 --> 08:21.940]  He is very smart and a wonderful child.
[08:21.940 --> 08:24.700]  He's been reading at a high school level since third grade.
[08:24.700 --> 08:26.980]  He stated that he had concerns for our health
[08:26.980 --> 08:28.860]  and legal ramifications.
[08:28.860 --> 08:30.820]  I explained that this conversation was much
[08:30.820 --> 08:34.220]  too adult-oriented to discuss at the current moment.
[08:34.220 --> 08:36.780]  He says in parentheses, had to buy time to research,
[08:36.780 --> 08:37.620]  which is a good idea.
[08:37.620 --> 08:39.740]  Do some research before you talk to the kids.
[08:39.740 --> 08:41.740]  The email goes on to say, I explained the importance
[08:41.740 --> 08:43.620]  of keeping this discussion in our home only,
[08:43.620 --> 08:45.480]  and if this information were to leak,
[08:45.480 --> 08:48.260]  that it could very well jeopardize our family.
[08:48.260 --> 08:49.880]  I told him that if he gained my trust
[08:49.880 --> 08:51.740]  by being mature about this serious topic,
[08:51.740 --> 08:54.620]  that we would explain cannabis more in the future.
[08:54.620 --> 08:55.620]  Here is where I am.
[08:55.620 --> 08:56.740]  I need help, my friend.
[08:56.740 --> 08:58.560]  Any advice?
[08:59.380 --> 09:01.540]  They sign the email with, please keep me anonymous,
[09:01.540 --> 09:03.580]  and they go on to say, I'll take a fat dab for you.
[09:03.580 --> 09:05.820]  Hugs all around.
[09:05.820 --> 09:08.180]  Hey, before I dish out any advice,
[09:08.180 --> 09:10.220]  I wanna say good job and great parenting.
[09:10.220 --> 09:12.140]  You handled that perfectly.
[09:12.140 --> 09:13.820]  I'm sure by what you said in the email
[09:13.820 --> 09:15.620]  that you understand this, but I wanna stress
[09:15.620 --> 09:18.140]  to everybody in the situation and anybody listening
[09:18.140 --> 09:20.620]  how important it is that this stays,
[09:20.620 --> 09:22.460]  that this information stays in your home,
[09:22.460 --> 09:25.440]  that your child does not mention your cannabis use
[09:25.440 --> 09:28.820]  to anybody at school, to anybody outside of the home.
[09:29.660 --> 09:30.700]  You've got to stress that to the child.
[09:30.700 --> 09:32.140]  I'm sure you already have,
[09:32.140 --> 09:34.620]  but that is one of the most important things right here.
[09:34.620 --> 09:37.660]  You were super correct with if this information leak,
[09:37.660 --> 09:40.220]  it could very well jeopardize your family.
[09:40.220 --> 09:43.140]  Explain to your child that they will take your child away.
[09:43.140 --> 09:46.260]  Your child could possibly be put in foster care.
[09:46.260 --> 09:49.520]  It will cause tons of problems for years down the road.
[09:49.520 --> 09:50.740]  It'll disrupt schooling.
[09:50.740 --> 09:51.780]  It'll disrupt home life.
[09:51.780 --> 09:52.820]  It'll disrupt their future.
[09:52.820 --> 09:54.140]  It will disrupt your future.
[09:54.140 --> 09:55.300]  It'll disrupt your careers.
[09:55.300 --> 09:57.360]  It'll disrupt your finances.
[09:57.360 --> 09:59.920]  Make sure that child understands how crucial it is
[09:59.920 --> 10:02.080]  that this is a family secret.
[10:02.080 --> 10:04.520]  Even here in Colorado, we have problems
[10:04.520 --> 10:07.800]  with Child Protective Services or the equivalent
[10:07.800 --> 10:10.600]  trying to interfere in cannabis patients' lives.
[10:10.600 --> 10:12.840]  They feel that the child, there's a grow in a home.
[10:12.840 --> 10:15.160]  They feel that the child is involved in the grow
[10:15.160 --> 10:16.280]  and they try to get involved.
[10:16.280 --> 10:18.200]  There's nothing wrong with cannabis.
[10:18.200 --> 10:21.580]  There's nothing wrong with cannabis for medicinal uses.
[10:21.580 --> 10:23.760]  There's nothing wrong with having a small medical grow
[10:23.760 --> 10:26.000]  or a personal grow in your home where your child lives.
[10:26.000 --> 10:27.220]  You can keep the child out of that.
[10:28.080 --> 10:28.920]  You can keep the child safe.
[10:28.920 --> 10:31.140]  There's no reason for CPS to be involved.
[10:31.140 --> 10:33.020]  There's no reason for authorities to be involved.
[10:33.020 --> 10:34.940]  So make sure that your children know
[10:34.940 --> 10:36.620]  that this is a family secret.
[10:36.620 --> 10:38.620]  I'm sure you understand how important it is.
[10:38.620 --> 10:40.540]  I just wanna stress to anybody out there
[10:40.540 --> 10:43.400]  in any illegal state, DARE is trying to program
[10:43.400 --> 10:45.380]  your children to snitch on you.
[10:45.380 --> 10:46.500]  Be careful.
[10:46.500 --> 10:48.260]  It might be time for all of you to talk
[10:48.260 --> 10:49.780]  to your kids about cannabis.
[10:49.780 --> 10:51.300]  Here's my theory.
[10:51.300 --> 10:53.540]  If you try to hide your cannabis use from your children,
[10:53.540 --> 10:54.820]  they're gonna think you're hiding something.
[10:54.820 --> 10:56.380]  They're gonna know you're up to something.
[10:56.380 --> 10:57.820]  They see you acting different.
[10:57.820 --> 10:59.200]  They see you being suspicious.
[10:59.200 --> 11:01.380]  Kids aren't as stupid as we wanna think they are.
[11:01.380 --> 11:02.540]  They're paying attention.
[11:02.540 --> 11:04.300]  They're copying your every move.
[11:04.300 --> 11:05.860]  They're doing all the shit you're doing
[11:05.860 --> 11:07.320]  because they wanna be just like you
[11:07.320 --> 11:08.800]  because you're their hero.
[11:08.800 --> 11:10.580]  So pay attention when you're around them.
[11:10.580 --> 11:11.900]  Watch how much they watch you.
[11:11.900 --> 11:13.700]  Watch how much they mimic you.
[11:13.700 --> 11:16.060]  Now, if you lie to them, they're not gonna trust you.
[11:16.060 --> 11:17.060]  They're not gonna believe you
[11:17.060 --> 11:19.060]  and they're gonna fucking lie to other people.
[11:19.060 --> 11:20.660]  Tell them the truth.
[11:20.660 --> 11:22.020]  If they know the truth,
[11:22.020 --> 11:23.780]  they know why they can't talk about it.
[11:23.780 --> 11:25.220]  They know what's going on.
[11:25.220 --> 11:27.860]  When it's not a big deal, when it's a secret,
[11:27.860 --> 11:29.260]  that's when shit is a big deal.
[11:29.260 --> 11:31.100]  When it's out in the open on the table,
[11:31.100 --> 11:32.860]  the kids don't care anymore.
[11:32.860 --> 11:35.820]  I've been mostly open since I've,
[11:35.820 --> 11:38.340]  since my daughter's been old enough to talk about things
[11:38.340 --> 11:39.820]  and actually have a conversation,
[11:39.820 --> 11:42.580]  I've been open, wide open about cannabis.
[11:42.580 --> 11:45.060]  If my daughter has any questions about cannabis,
[11:45.060 --> 11:46.700]  if my daughter has questions about anything,
[11:46.700 --> 11:48.500]  she knows that she can come to me
[11:48.500 --> 11:50.860]  and we can talk about anything.
[11:50.860 --> 11:53.500]  And I think that that builds a stronger relationship.
[11:53.540 --> 11:55.740]  If she is afraid to talk to me about something
[11:55.740 --> 11:57.020]  or if I keep secrets from her,
[11:57.020 --> 11:59.220]  then she feels like she needs to keep secrets from me.
[11:59.220 --> 12:00.940]  Why not just have an open door policy?
[12:00.940 --> 12:02.300]  Let's talk about it.
[12:02.300 --> 12:04.100]  That way I can explain the truths.
[12:04.100 --> 12:05.660]  I can dispel myths.
[12:05.660 --> 12:07.020]  I can tell her what to expect.
[12:07.020 --> 12:08.740]  I can tell her what to avoid.
[12:08.740 --> 12:13.740]  It seems much wiser to me to tell the kids the truth.
[12:13.740 --> 12:15.340]  That way when Derek comes along
[12:15.340 --> 12:17.820]  and they're trying to trick your kids into snitching on you,
[12:17.820 --> 12:19.820]  your kids are on your team and they already know,
[12:19.820 --> 12:21.860]  hey, dad coached me, mom coached me.
[12:21.860 --> 12:23.260]  They said these fuckers were gonna come in
[12:24.020 --> 12:25.060]  and ask if my mom had any weird smell
[12:25.060 --> 12:26.580]  and shit around the house.
[12:26.580 --> 12:28.820]  If you've lied to the kids and you've been hiding it,
[12:28.820 --> 12:30.500]  chances are they're gonna be like, you know what?
[12:30.500 --> 12:33.260]  My mom does do some weird, sketchy shit every day.
[12:33.260 --> 12:34.340]  Like when Ellen comes on,
[12:34.340 --> 12:36.260]  she makes me go in the other room and play with my toys.
[12:36.260 --> 12:37.980]  And I smell this really weird, funky shit.
[12:37.980 --> 12:40.100]  And then I come out and she's watching Ellen eating popcorn
[12:40.100 --> 12:42.180]  with a stupid fucking smile on her face.
[12:42.180 --> 12:44.180]  The kids aren't as stupid as we wanna think they are,
[12:44.180 --> 12:46.300]  you guys, the kids are paying attention.
[12:46.300 --> 12:48.020]  So you pay attention to them.
[12:48.020 --> 12:49.220]  You tell them the truth.
[12:49.220 --> 12:52.180]  You communicate with them before the fuckers in dare,
[12:52.180 --> 12:53.780]  before the fuckers at school,
[12:53.780 --> 12:55.700]  before somebody else gets it out of them
[12:55.700 --> 12:57.020]  and uses it against you.
[12:57.020 --> 12:58.780]  Because I know you're trying to be a good parent.
[12:58.780 --> 13:02.340]  You can consume cannabis and still be a great parent.
[13:02.340 --> 13:05.820]  Cannabis consumption does not make you a bad parent.
[13:05.820 --> 13:07.580]  And I can tell that anybody that would take the time
[13:07.580 --> 13:09.640]  to send me an email to say, hey, what do I do?
[13:09.640 --> 13:10.740]  You are a great parent.
[13:10.740 --> 13:11.820]  So you are on the right path.
[13:11.820 --> 13:13.520]  I've got faith in your parenting skills.
[13:13.520 --> 13:15.140]  You're doing shit correctly.
[13:15.140 --> 13:16.500]  Tell that kid the truth.
[13:16.500 --> 13:18.700]  Now, a couple of things I wanna talk about here.
[13:18.700 --> 13:21.620]  You said that the child is concerned about your health
[13:21.620 --> 13:23.800]  because of things that he's probably heard in school.
[13:23.800 --> 13:26.180]  They tell you that cannabis kills brain cells.
[13:26.180 --> 13:28.820]  They tell you that cannabis gives you cancer.
[13:28.820 --> 13:30.540]  Maybe it's time to sit down with your child
[13:30.540 --> 13:32.660]  and pull up some YouTube videos of people
[13:32.660 --> 13:35.700]  who are suffering from extreme medical conditions,
[13:35.700 --> 13:37.500]  obvious blatant medical conditions,
[13:37.500 --> 13:39.980]  and watch them consume a little bit of cannabis.
[13:39.980 --> 13:41.620]  Then let the kids watch how that little bit
[13:41.620 --> 13:43.900]  of cannabis consumption repairs these people,
[13:43.900 --> 13:45.180]  how it lets them enjoy life,
[13:45.180 --> 13:46.660]  how it makes their seizures go away,
[13:46.660 --> 13:48.060]  how it makes their palsy go away,
[13:48.060 --> 13:50.260]  how it makes their tics and twitches go away,
[13:50.260 --> 13:52.880]  or how it just improves the quality of their life.
[13:52.880 --> 13:54.360]  I'm sure just a quick Google search
[13:54.360 --> 13:57.420]  or a quick YouTube search of medical marijuana patient
[13:57.420 --> 14:00.020]  finds relief or something along that line.
[14:00.020 --> 14:01.900]  I'm sure you could find a bunch of videos
[14:01.900 --> 14:03.660]  of people consuming cannabis.
[14:03.660 --> 14:05.560]  And I'm sure there are people having seizures
[14:05.560 --> 14:07.440]  where people rub cannabis on their feet
[14:07.440 --> 14:08.740]  and they stop having seizures.
[14:08.740 --> 14:11.420]  There's a video of a guy having a full-on palsy fit
[14:11.420 --> 14:13.500]  where he's practically smacking himself in the face
[14:13.500 --> 14:15.340]  because he's got no control of his hands.
[14:15.340 --> 14:17.260]  His friend lights a pipe and puts it to his mouth
[14:17.260 --> 14:18.980]  and he smokes off the pipe a little bit
[14:18.980 --> 14:20.100]  and the palsy stops.
[14:20.100 --> 14:21.100]  If you could find that video,
[14:21.100 --> 14:22.940]  that may be helpful for the kids.
[14:22.940 --> 14:25.300]  The reason they have fear for your medical safety,
[14:25.300 --> 14:27.420]  for your health, is because they've been programmed
[14:27.420 --> 14:29.340]  to think that that is a thing.
[14:29.340 --> 14:30.660]  So you've gotta tell them the truth.
[14:30.660 --> 14:33.240]  They've been lied to so much that they believe that.
[14:33.240 --> 14:35.340]  They've got the same conditioning that the old people,
[14:35.340 --> 14:37.800]  that the generation before us, they were lied to.
[14:37.800 --> 14:39.900]  They were told that cannabis will ruin your brain,
[14:39.900 --> 14:41.440]  that it'll cause all these problems.
[14:41.440 --> 14:43.620]  They're still using the same scare tactics
[14:43.620 --> 14:45.980]  and the same methods and techniques that they've used
[14:45.980 --> 14:47.920]  since our grandparents were children.
[14:47.920 --> 14:49.200]  So we've just gotta tell them the truth.
[14:49.200 --> 14:51.160]  The truth is the answer, you guys.
[14:51.160 --> 14:52.920]  Now you said your child's next concern
[14:52.920 --> 14:55.160]  was legal ramifications.
[14:55.160 --> 14:57.760]  You've got a smart child there that emphasized
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.720]  to that child that it's got to be your secret,
[15:00.720 --> 15:02.120]  that if that gets out of the house,
[15:02.120 --> 15:04.340]  that's when the legal ramifications kick in.
[15:04.340 --> 15:06.960]  You've got the herb there, you're not going anywhere with it,
[15:06.960 --> 15:08.480]  you're not doing anything crazy.
[15:08.480 --> 15:10.400]  To the best of my knowledge, you're not growing it.
[15:10.400 --> 15:12.720]  You're just consuming a little bit of cannabis
[15:12.720 --> 15:13.820]  for medical reasons.
[15:13.820 --> 15:15.440]  You will not get the law involved.
[15:15.440 --> 15:17.440]  So as long as you guys stay quiet about it
[15:17.960 --> 15:18.800]  and stay adults about it,
[15:18.800 --> 15:21.000]  there will be no legal ramifications.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  So depending on the age level of your child
[15:23.000 --> 15:24.240]  and how much they can comprehend,
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.360]  this could be an opening for a lot of conversations.
[15:27.360 --> 15:30.480]  You can talk about how cannabis is legal in some places
[15:30.480 --> 15:34.220]  and not in others, how it's legal medically in some places
[15:34.220 --> 15:37.620]  and how it's available recreationally in some places.
[15:37.620 --> 15:40.700]  Then you can also teach your child about prohibition,
[15:40.700 --> 15:42.020]  not only cannabis prohibition,
[15:42.020 --> 15:43.820]  the history of alcohol prohibition,
[15:43.820 --> 15:46.960]  and then that will spark conversations about history.
[15:47.480 --> 15:49.360]  It'll spark conversations about America.
[15:49.360 --> 15:51.720]  Then it will spark conversations about rules
[15:51.720 --> 15:53.320]  and government control.
[15:53.320 --> 15:56.260]  And it'll spark so much conversation
[15:56.260 --> 15:57.960]  and you will get to interact with that child
[15:57.960 --> 15:59.800]  and kind of shape their mind a little bit more
[15:59.800 --> 16:02.200]  and open their eyes to a lot of things,
[16:02.200 --> 16:04.640]  the way the government works, the way the systems work,
[16:04.640 --> 16:06.240]  the way that I feel like the government
[16:06.240 --> 16:08.080]  tries to control the people a little bit.
[16:08.080 --> 16:10.780]  If they're prohibiting us from consuming a plant
[16:10.780 --> 16:12.940]  that makes us feel better, they are controlling us.
[16:12.940 --> 16:15.040]  So you can open the child's eyes to that a little bit.
[16:15.040 --> 16:16.400]  If they're old enough, I'm not sure
[16:16.760 --> 16:18.200]  how old your children are,
[16:18.200 --> 16:20.920]  but it's a lot of doorways for a great conversation.
[16:20.920 --> 16:22.760]  And I think conversation with kids is great.
[16:22.760 --> 16:23.760]  That's how they learn.
[16:23.760 --> 16:24.600]  That's how you shape them.
[16:24.600 --> 16:26.520]  That's how you make them great adults.
[16:26.520 --> 16:27.680]  So I think you're doing the right thing.
[16:27.680 --> 16:30.720]  My advice again is to tell the youths the truth.
[16:30.720 --> 16:32.320]  Babylon lies to the kids.
[16:32.320 --> 16:33.780]  TV lies to the kids.
[16:33.780 --> 16:35.480]  Cartoons lies to the kids.
[16:35.480 --> 16:37.500]  Everybody out on the street lie to the kids.
[16:37.500 --> 16:40.120]  All the billboards and advertising lies to the kids.
[16:40.120 --> 16:42.200]  The kids lie to each other to build each other's egos
[16:42.200 --> 16:43.800]  and to try to be cooler.
[16:43.800 --> 16:45.200]  Somebody's got to tell the kids the truth
[16:45.200 --> 16:47.840]  and that's your job as a parent to straighten them out.
[16:47.840 --> 16:49.360]  Even if it's weird, awkward shit,
[16:49.360 --> 16:51.760]  sometimes you got to tell the kids the truth.
[16:51.760 --> 16:53.060]  That's my opinion.
[16:53.060 --> 16:55.000]  I've never claimed to be super dad
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.400]  or have a parenting podcast.
[16:57.400 --> 16:58.840]  So if I said something you don't agree with
[16:58.840 --> 17:01.040]  anybody out there, I would love an email in response.
[17:01.040 --> 17:02.840]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[17:02.840 --> 17:04.040]  Keep the conversation going.
[17:04.040 --> 17:06.080]  I would like your input on this.
[17:06.080 --> 17:08.600]  Everybody out there, either email me or send me a tweet.
[17:08.600 --> 17:11.000]  I want to know how you teach your kids
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.080]  about your cannabis use,
[17:12.080 --> 17:14.360]  how you handle your cannabis use with your children.
[17:14.360 --> 17:15.180]  Is it a secret?
[17:15.960 --> 17:16.780]  Is it something that's open?
[17:16.780 --> 17:18.260]  Have you talked to them about it?
[17:18.260 --> 17:20.200]  When you message me, also include your location
[17:20.200 --> 17:22.980]  so that I can know if you're in an illegal area
[17:22.980 --> 17:25.740]  or if you're in a state that allows cannabis use
[17:25.740 --> 17:28.020]  recreationally and or medically.
[17:28.020 --> 17:28.860]  I'm curious.
[17:28.860 --> 17:31.740]  I want to learn so that I can help more people.
[17:31.740 --> 17:33.260]  The person that sent me that email
[17:33.260 --> 17:35.280]  asked that I do not include their name,
[17:35.280 --> 17:37.220]  which I respect, that's understandable,
[17:37.220 --> 17:38.420]  but I want to give them a big shout out.
[17:38.420 --> 17:39.580]  Thanks for the great message.
[17:39.580 --> 17:40.660]  Thanks for the great content.
[17:40.660 --> 17:42.980]  And thank you so much for being a great parent
[17:42.980 --> 17:44.380]  and trying to do the right thing
[17:44.380 --> 17:47.180]  when it comes to cannabis and kids.
[17:47.180 --> 17:49.980]  All right, podcast world, I have got another email.
[17:49.980 --> 17:51.340]  Let's just jump right into it.
[17:51.340 --> 17:52.180]  This one says,
[17:52.180 --> 17:54.260]  Rasta Jeff, I've been listening to your podcast
[17:54.260 --> 17:56.700]  since I started growing here in Colorado.
[17:56.700 --> 17:58.140]  I tell everyone I can about it
[17:58.140 --> 18:01.060]  and I try to promote your vast wealth of cannabis knowledge.
[18:01.060 --> 18:03.260]  I love your show and can't believe the info you share
[18:03.260 --> 18:05.100]  without substantial charge.
[18:05.100 --> 18:07.020]  Anyway, I was hoping you could point me
[18:07.020 --> 18:10.420]  in the direction of a podcast that you cover bud rot.
[18:10.420 --> 18:11.600]  Well, here it is, dude,
[18:11.640 --> 18:14.080]  because I haven't done a podcast about bud rot before this.
[18:14.080 --> 18:16.040]  So this will be the episode
[18:16.040 --> 18:17.960]  and I hope you're listening to it.
[18:17.960 --> 18:18.880]  The email goes on and says,
[18:18.880 --> 18:21.600]  it seems the larger and more bud sites I produce
[18:21.600 --> 18:23.220]  through topping and et cetera,
[18:23.220 --> 18:25.680]  increases my chance for bud rot.
[18:25.680 --> 18:28.700]  I would like to know how to avoid this frustrating problem.
[18:28.700 --> 18:30.240]  I have an order coming from the Dank team
[18:30.240 --> 18:31.120]  to run your genetics
[18:31.120 --> 18:33.440]  and I don't want to fuck it up near the end.
[18:33.440 --> 18:35.400]  Also curious if you will be releasing
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.800]  any fem seeds anytime soon.
[18:37.800 --> 18:41.680]  Hopefully I'll run into you one day at higher elevations.
[18:41.680 --> 18:43.580]  Your fan, Mike.
[18:43.580 --> 18:44.960]  Hey Mike, thanks for the great email.
[18:44.960 --> 18:46.800]  I'm curious which of my strains
[18:46.800 --> 18:48.540]  you selected from the Dank team.
[18:48.540 --> 18:50.240]  I gotta remind everybody since you brought it up,
[18:50.240 --> 18:51.280]  thedankteam.com.
[18:51.280 --> 18:53.840]  If you're looking for regular or feminized seeds,
[18:53.840 --> 18:56.360]  I highly recommend thedankteam.com.
[18:56.360 --> 19:00.680]  The D-A-N-K, the Dank, thedankteam.com.
[19:00.680 --> 19:02.140]  Home of the Dank, check them out.
[19:02.140 --> 19:03.720]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[19:03.720 --> 19:05.560]  They've got regular, they've got feminized seeds.
[19:05.560 --> 19:07.300]  They've got seeds for a mile high.
[19:07.780 --> 19:08.780]  They've got seeds for Cannaventure, Rare Dankness,
[19:08.780 --> 19:11.980]  Irie Genetics, Sin City, Sour Seeds.
[19:11.980 --> 19:13.700]  They carry all kinds of breeders.
[19:13.700 --> 19:14.700]  If you're looking for seeds,
[19:14.700 --> 19:15.900]  they've got what you're looking for there.
[19:15.900 --> 19:17.840]  Of course, I recommend Irie Genetic Seeds.
[19:17.840 --> 19:18.740]  That is my brand.
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.860]  I create those.
[19:19.860 --> 19:20.700]  That's all me.
[19:20.700 --> 19:22.180]  So if you need some seeds,
[19:22.180 --> 19:23.820]  go get yourself some Irie Genetic Seeds.
[19:23.820 --> 19:24.660]  They're very affordable.
[19:24.660 --> 19:26.900]  They're very reliable, high quality seeds.
[19:26.900 --> 19:29.620]  Unfortunately, there are no feminized seeds available
[19:29.620 --> 19:32.020]  on the website from Irie Genetics right now.
[19:32.020 --> 19:34.100]  Another question this guy said was,
[19:34.180 --> 19:37.640]  curious if you'll be releasing any Femseeds anytime soon.
[19:37.640 --> 19:38.940]  Not anytime soon.
[19:38.940 --> 19:40.820]  I'm working with this Arise male.
[19:40.820 --> 19:43.380]  I'm making a bunch of fun crosses with him.
[19:43.380 --> 19:45.200]  I've got Arise F2s for myself.
[19:45.200 --> 19:47.980]  I plan on making Arise F3s pretty soon.
[19:47.980 --> 19:50.080]  I've got stuff lined up, stuff in the works.
[19:50.080 --> 19:52.380]  I will be searching out a new male plant.
[19:52.380 --> 19:54.380]  I'm not telling anybody what that male will be,
[19:54.380 --> 19:55.740]  but I'm selecting for a new male
[19:55.740 --> 19:57.540]  to open up my breeding a little bit.
[19:57.540 --> 19:58.980]  We're gonna go a little more Indica.
[19:58.980 --> 20:01.420]  Most of my stuff is really heavy sativa.
[20:01.420 --> 20:03.800]  I wanna put some Indica into my lineup.
[20:04.500 --> 20:06.840]  I do not see myself making any feminized seeds
[20:06.840 --> 20:11.680]  until at least after I do an Indica dominant breeding run.
[20:11.680 --> 20:15.040]  Then there may be some feminized seeds there.
[20:15.040 --> 20:17.360]  If I do make Femseeds, it's going to be quite a while,
[20:17.360 --> 20:20.320]  at least a year, probably longer than that.
[20:20.320 --> 20:21.720]  Sorry to disappoint you.
[20:21.720 --> 20:22.960]  Thanks for the interest in Femseeds.
[20:22.960 --> 20:24.280]  There are plenty of other breeders
[20:24.280 --> 20:26.660]  that are putting out Femseeds online.
[20:26.660 --> 20:28.560]  You can probably get plenty of great Femseeds
[20:28.560 --> 20:31.120]  on thedankteam.com.
[20:31.120 --> 20:33.600]  All right, so let's talk more about the topic of your email.
[20:34.400 --> 20:35.240]  You're worried about bud rot.
[20:35.240 --> 20:37.400]  It looks like you've experienced bud rot before.
[20:37.400 --> 20:39.440]  I predict that a lot of outdoor growers
[20:39.440 --> 20:42.120]  are going to experience a lot of bud rot this year
[20:42.120 --> 20:43.560]  because of the moisture.
[20:43.560 --> 20:46.280]  Moisture, stagnant air, humidity,
[20:46.280 --> 20:49.600]  and giant buds are your cause of bud rot.
[20:49.600 --> 20:51.320]  Let's talk about bud rot for a minute.
[20:51.320 --> 20:52.880]  If you've ever been breaking up a bud,
[20:52.880 --> 20:55.040]  like a long bud with more than two,
[20:55.040 --> 20:56.800]  so if you've got a cola,
[20:56.800 --> 20:59.520]  it's got like two or three buds around the stick.
[20:59.520 --> 21:01.040]  If you could break off one little bud
[21:01.040 --> 21:01.960]  and that probably packs a bowl,
[21:01.960 --> 21:03.080]  you break off another little bud,
[21:03.160 --> 21:04.200]  that'll pack a bowl.
[21:04.200 --> 21:06.200]  Sometimes you'll pull off those little nugs
[21:06.200 --> 21:09.120]  off the big stick and you'll see like a gray
[21:09.120 --> 21:11.920]  or white or light brown discoloration
[21:11.920 --> 21:13.640]  on the bottom side of the buds.
[21:13.640 --> 21:17.140]  That is either the start of bud mold or bud mold itself.
[21:17.140 --> 21:19.560]  It starts off kind of like this brown hint
[21:19.560 --> 21:21.080]  and then it turns this white color
[21:21.080 --> 21:23.520]  and then it turns fuzzy and then it gets furry
[21:23.520 --> 21:25.360]  and then honestly it looks like a spider egg.
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.320]  If you've ever seen spider eggs, those fuzzy white balls,
[21:28.320 --> 21:30.840]  it looks like that is growing on the inside of your bud
[21:30.840 --> 21:32.560]  and it will take over the inside of the bud.
[21:33.040 --> 21:34.280]  You cannot see it while the bud's growing.
[21:34.280 --> 21:35.440]  You can take photos of it,
[21:35.440 --> 21:37.400]  the buds will look fucking delicious.
[21:37.400 --> 21:39.240]  Then you cut it and you start to get inside of it
[21:39.240 --> 21:41.360]  and you see this funky shit.
[21:41.360 --> 21:44.000]  It stinks, it smells terrible,
[21:44.000 --> 21:45.300]  I can't even describe the smell.
[21:45.300 --> 21:47.160]  I can't think of anything that smells like that
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.700]  other than bud rot.
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.040]  It's just ugly.
[21:51.280 --> 21:52.360]  A lot of times it will,
[21:52.360 --> 21:54.600]  I said you can't see it on the buds when they're growing.
[21:54.600 --> 21:56.760]  If it is just ignored and it gets extreme,
[21:56.760 --> 21:58.440]  it will grow to the outside of the buds.
[21:58.440 --> 22:01.320]  It will just look like brown shit coming out of your buds.
[22:01.360 --> 22:04.880]  Just moldy, brown, sludgy, funky shit.
[22:04.880 --> 22:07.600]  Sometimes it looks like white dandelions
[22:07.600 --> 22:08.760]  just growing out of the buds.
[22:08.760 --> 22:10.120]  It kind of depends on the conditions
[22:10.120 --> 22:12.040]  and where the mold started and how it's growing.
[22:12.040 --> 22:13.920]  It'll change colors and it'll grow.
[22:13.920 --> 22:16.120]  It is disgusting, it is non-consumable.
[22:16.120 --> 22:19.820]  If you've got bud rot on your buds, throw that shit away.
[22:19.820 --> 22:22.160]  Do not smoke it, do not sell it, do not give it away,
[22:22.160 --> 22:23.200]  do not trade it.
[22:23.200 --> 22:25.320]  You can either put it in the compost bin and compost it
[22:25.320 --> 22:27.640]  or you can put it in the trash and get rid of it.
[22:27.640 --> 22:29.020]  Please don't give it to anybody.
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.020]  Please don't smoke it.
[22:30.020 --> 22:31.560]  Please don't make extracts out of it.
[22:31.560 --> 22:34.520]  Certainly do not make fucking edibles out of it.
[22:34.520 --> 22:39.240]  Moldy bud is only good for trash or compost.
[22:39.240 --> 22:40.280]  So now you know what to look for.
[22:40.280 --> 22:41.680]  Now you know what bud rot looks like.
[22:41.680 --> 22:42.520]  It looks like shit.
[22:42.520 --> 22:44.240]  It looks like a Q-tip growing out of your bud.
[22:44.240 --> 22:45.400]  It looks like cotton.
[22:45.400 --> 22:46.660]  It just looks like hell.
[22:46.660 --> 22:48.960]  Let's talk about what causes that.
[22:48.960 --> 22:52.980]  What causes bud rot is mainly humidity inside of the buds.
[22:52.980 --> 22:55.800]  Maybe you've got too much humidity during your day cycle.
[22:55.800 --> 22:57.160]  Maybe you've got too much humidity
[22:57.160 --> 22:58.520]  during your night cycle.
[22:58.520 --> 23:01.100]  Maybe you've got a big swing in temps and humidity
[23:01.100 --> 23:02.900]  from your day to your night cycle.
[23:02.900 --> 23:06.020]  Those are things that will encourage bud rot
[23:06.020 --> 23:08.780]  or boitritis to grow within your buds.
[23:08.780 --> 23:10.780]  You'll probably find the bud mold starting
[23:10.780 --> 23:13.060]  either in a giant top cola or you'll find it
[23:13.060 --> 23:15.740]  in a lower part that doesn't get a lot of light.
[23:15.740 --> 23:18.240]  The light kind of prevents it, kind of kills it a little bit
[23:18.240 --> 23:21.020]  but those lower shaded areas are definitely going
[23:21.020 --> 23:24.220]  to be prime targets for gray mold,
[23:24.220 --> 23:26.600]  for bud mold, for boitritis.
[23:26.620 --> 23:30.300]  So usually humidity and low light are what are going
[23:30.300 --> 23:32.020]  to cause your gray mold.
[23:32.020 --> 23:33.860]  So you probably have too much humidity in there.
[23:33.860 --> 23:36.860]  Try to get that humidity down to under 50%
[23:36.860 --> 23:38.460]  during your flower cycle.
[23:38.460 --> 23:40.060]  If you've got too much humidity,
[23:40.060 --> 23:42.340]  you're going to start causing mold
[23:42.340 --> 23:44.140]  and powdery mildew issues.
[23:44.140 --> 23:48.500]  If you see any yellowing or dead or dying leaves,
[23:48.500 --> 23:50.020]  get that out of there.
[23:50.020 --> 23:51.600]  Once you see bud mold forming,
[23:51.600 --> 23:53.060]  there's not really a lot you can do.
[23:53.060 --> 23:55.380]  You can either cut out the section where it's growing.
[23:55.400 --> 23:57.560]  You can try to treat the plants with a fungicide,
[23:57.560 --> 23:59.820]  something like cease or double nickel
[23:59.820 --> 24:02.960]  or probably serenade or something like that would work.
[24:02.960 --> 24:04.520]  But there's not really a lot you can do.
[24:04.520 --> 24:08.240]  Sometimes messing with mold and disturbing mold spores
[24:08.240 --> 24:10.960]  and cutting that shit down will just bounce it
[24:10.960 --> 24:13.000]  around the grow room more than you already had
[24:13.000 --> 24:13.880]  and you're just going to spread it.
[24:13.880 --> 24:15.280]  It's going to get on your clothes.
[24:15.280 --> 24:18.200]  Something I should mention and should certainly recommend
[24:18.200 --> 24:20.880]  when you are working with plants that have boitritis
[24:20.880 --> 24:23.760]  or gray mold or bud mold or any sort of mildew,
[24:23.760 --> 24:25.260]  if you work with that plant,
[24:25.260 --> 24:27.040]  clean your scissors with alcohol
[24:27.040 --> 24:29.160]  before you go to another plant.
[24:29.160 --> 24:30.580]  You should always be keeping your scissors
[24:30.580 --> 24:31.420]  and your tools clean.
[24:31.420 --> 24:33.660]  Just scrub your scissors occasionally with alcohol.
[24:33.660 --> 24:34.580]  Keep everything clean.
[24:34.580 --> 24:36.060]  Change your gloves frequently,
[24:36.060 --> 24:37.700]  especially if you see some mold.
[24:37.700 --> 24:40.700]  So one thing I would do is add some dehumidification.
[24:40.700 --> 24:44.460]  I talk about ventilation and ventilating your grow room
[24:44.460 --> 24:45.740]  on this show a lot.
[24:45.740 --> 24:47.980]  A lot of people do not realize how important it is
[24:47.980 --> 24:50.880]  to evacuate old air and bring in fresh air.
[24:50.880 --> 24:53.580]  You need to exchange the air in that grow room frequently.
[24:54.400 --> 24:56.200]  That could be contributing to your bud rot,
[24:56.200 --> 24:57.600]  to your mold problems.
[24:57.600 --> 24:59.420]  So you need to get that old musty air out of there.
[24:59.420 --> 25:00.620]  You need to get fresh air in there.
[25:00.620 --> 25:02.100]  You need to lower the humidity.
[25:02.100 --> 25:03.500]  I would put some fans in the room.
[25:03.500 --> 25:05.200]  Make sure that every leaf in that room,
[25:05.200 --> 25:07.760]  it doesn't need to be bouncing around really crazy.
[25:07.760 --> 25:09.440]  It just needs a little rustle occasionally.
[25:09.440 --> 25:11.280]  The fan can sweep from right to left.
[25:11.280 --> 25:13.920]  And rustle all those leaves.
[25:13.920 --> 25:15.240]  They can rest and then it'll come back
[25:15.240 --> 25:17.120]  and sweep left to right.
[25:17.120 --> 25:18.240]  And rustle those leaves.
[25:18.240 --> 25:20.160]  Just make sure that those leaves get moved around.
[25:20.160 --> 25:21.440]  That'll just move airflow in there.
[25:21.460 --> 25:24.140]  The more airflow, the less chances for mold.
[25:24.140 --> 25:26.940]  It's just when the water and the air sit there
[25:26.940 --> 25:27.860]  inside those buds.
[25:27.860 --> 25:29.340]  The buds are like big sponges.
[25:29.340 --> 25:30.740]  So you got these big sponges.
[25:30.740 --> 25:31.660]  And it gets humid in there.
[25:31.660 --> 25:33.180]  That moisture goes inside the bud.
[25:33.180 --> 25:35.660]  Or it gets hot and that bud starts sweating.
[25:35.660 --> 25:37.180]  And now you've got moisture inside there.
[25:37.180 --> 25:39.260]  Then the lights go off and it gets cool in there.
[25:39.260 --> 25:42.020]  And now you've got the perfect environment to create mold.
[25:42.020 --> 25:44.100]  So just think about how you're creating the mold.
[25:44.100 --> 25:45.740]  Where the moisture's coming from.
[25:45.740 --> 25:47.900]  What climate is causing that.
[25:47.900 --> 25:49.380]  And you've got to correct that.
[25:49.380 --> 25:51.020]  So you probably have too much humidity.
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.120]  You've got to get that humidity out of there.
[25:53.120 --> 25:54.600]  Are you over watering the plants?
[25:54.600 --> 25:55.720]  Is it a hydro grow?
[25:55.720 --> 25:57.680]  Is your reservoir in the room?
[25:57.680 --> 25:59.240]  I don't know what type of grow you've got.
[25:59.240 --> 26:01.160]  But those are a few things you could think about.
[26:01.160 --> 26:04.000]  If you've got excessive water in the room for any reason,
[26:04.000 --> 26:04.840]  get it out of there.
[26:04.840 --> 26:05.920]  If the res is in the room,
[26:05.920 --> 26:08.080]  put that on the other side of the wall.
[26:08.080 --> 26:10.400]  Whatever water is left in the tray after your watering,
[26:10.400 --> 26:11.940]  make sure you vacuum that up.
[26:11.940 --> 26:14.360]  Just get all the extra water out of there.
[26:14.360 --> 26:17.040]  If the plants aren't showing any signs of needing water,
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.600]  maybe wait another day to water.
[26:18.620 --> 26:21.100]  So you can get some of that air out of there.
[26:21.100 --> 26:24.300]  If you've got that much humidity that's causing you bud rot,
[26:24.300 --> 26:25.540]  there's too much water in there.
[26:25.540 --> 26:27.800]  Maybe you're over watering the plants.
[26:27.800 --> 26:29.220]  I'm not in your grow and I haven't seen it,
[26:29.220 --> 26:31.340]  so I can't tell you exactly what's causing it.
[26:31.340 --> 26:34.180]  But it is too much humidity and not enough air flow.
[26:34.180 --> 26:36.700]  One thing that does suck that will contribute to bud rot
[26:36.700 --> 26:38.260]  is too big of a bud.
[26:38.260 --> 26:40.460]  Like I said, you've got a big giant bud
[26:40.460 --> 26:41.740]  that acts as a sponge.
[26:41.740 --> 26:43.460]  You get a bunch of humidity in there.
[26:43.460 --> 26:45.540]  All that humidity gathers in that bud.
[26:45.540 --> 26:47.580]  Then it goes dark during your night cycle.
[26:47.580 --> 26:49.200]  It cools off just a little bit
[26:49.200 --> 26:50.880]  because you don't have those lights in there.
[26:50.880 --> 26:53.300]  And that makes the perfect condition
[26:53.300 --> 26:55.400]  for powdery mildew to start happening.
[26:55.400 --> 26:57.760]  That makes the perfect condition for boitritis,
[26:57.760 --> 27:00.160]  for bud molds, for all kinds of funky shit
[27:00.160 --> 27:01.640]  to start happening in there.
[27:01.640 --> 27:03.040]  Another thing that just crossed my mind
[27:03.040 --> 27:05.440]  that could be contributing to your problems,
[27:05.440 --> 27:07.360]  sprays, foliar sprays.
[27:07.360 --> 27:09.480]  Are you spraying right before the lights go out?
[27:09.480 --> 27:11.900]  Because you are creating mad humidity.
[27:11.900 --> 27:15.360]  You are creating the perfect conditions for bud mold.
[27:15.360 --> 27:17.460]  So if you're spraying right when the lights go out,
[27:18.300 --> 27:20.080]  you may need to work on spraying a little bit earlier.
[27:20.080 --> 27:22.540]  Turn the lights off, spray, wait a little bit
[27:22.540 --> 27:23.820]  before you close up the room
[27:23.820 --> 27:26.280]  because you need to get some air in and out of that room.
[27:26.280 --> 27:27.860]  You need to get that moisture out.
[27:27.860 --> 27:29.220]  So maybe spray an hour earlier
[27:29.220 --> 27:30.840]  so that you can leave the doors open.
[27:30.840 --> 27:32.140]  You don't have the grow lights on in there,
[27:32.140 --> 27:33.220]  but you've got the doors open
[27:33.220 --> 27:34.460]  so that the air can flow around.
[27:34.460 --> 27:36.400]  You can get rid of all that humidity.
[27:36.400 --> 27:38.000]  Then when the lights are supposed to go off,
[27:38.000 --> 27:39.160]  go in there and correct your timer
[27:39.160 --> 27:40.060]  so that it goes off and on
[27:40.060 --> 27:41.760]  like it's supposed to the next cycle,
[27:41.760 --> 27:43.960]  and then close up so it could be dark in there
[27:43.960 --> 27:46.580]  like you need it for the post-spray conditions.
[27:47.260 --> 27:48.780]  If you're spraying right before the lights go out,
[27:48.780 --> 27:50.420]  you may be contributing to the humidity.
[27:50.420 --> 27:52.860]  Your sprays may be contributing to your humidity.
[27:52.860 --> 27:54.740]  It sounds like you've got gigantic buds
[27:54.740 --> 27:55.760]  and a whole bunch of them,
[27:55.760 --> 27:57.640]  which means you've got a lot of water in there,
[27:57.640 --> 27:59.120]  which means it's probably too humid.
[27:59.120 --> 28:02.840]  So dehumidifier, more fans, less water,
[28:02.840 --> 28:05.580]  that is probably the solution.
[28:05.580 --> 28:07.040]  Hey Mike, I hope I answered your question.
[28:07.040 --> 28:09.860]  I also want to thank you for listening to the podcast
[28:09.860 --> 28:11.240]  and for telling everyone
[28:11.240 --> 28:13.960]  and promoting my vast wealth of cannabis knowledge.
[28:13.960 --> 28:15.200]  I do appreciate that.
[28:15.200 --> 28:16.100]  It means a lot to me.
[28:16.620 --> 28:17.700]  And dude, this show will always be free.
[28:17.700 --> 28:18.900]  You said thanks for giving out the show
[28:18.900 --> 28:21.060]  without a substantial charge.
[28:21.060 --> 28:22.740]  This podcast will always be free.
[28:22.740 --> 28:24.340]  It's from my heart to your garden.
[28:24.340 --> 28:26.060]  I hope you guys appreciate it.
[28:26.060 --> 28:28.980]  If I save one person's garden every week with my podcast,
[28:28.980 --> 28:30.680]  then it is worth my time and energy.
[28:30.680 --> 28:31.520]  Just one garden.
[28:31.520 --> 28:32.660]  If you get to harvest your crop
[28:32.660 --> 28:33.900]  that you would not have gotten to harvest
[28:33.900 --> 28:36.700]  without my guidance, it was well worth it.
[28:36.700 --> 28:38.660]  All right, you guys, I want to thank both my emailers
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.820]  for sending me messages and asking great questions.
[28:40.820 --> 28:42.800]  Once again, if you've got a question you'd like to ask me,
[28:42.800 --> 28:43.740]  I'd love to hear from you.
[28:43.740 --> 28:46.340]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[28:46.340 --> 28:48.580]  I will get through all of these emails.
[28:48.580 --> 28:49.660]  There are hundreds of them.
[28:49.660 --> 28:52.820]  I'm going to answer as many as I can.
[28:52.820 --> 28:55.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to wrap up the podcast.
[28:55.420 --> 28:56.620]  I would appreciate it if you follow me
[28:56.620 --> 28:58.060]  on all of the social media.
[28:58.060 --> 29:00.020]  If you're into Facebook, you can find me on Facebook.
[29:00.020 --> 29:01.740]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:01.740 --> 29:04.140]  On Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[29:04.140 --> 29:06.600]  And on Instagram, I use my seed company name.
[29:06.600 --> 29:09.260]  It's irie underscore genetics.
[29:09.260 --> 29:11.060]  I hope you check me out there.
[29:11.060 --> 29:13.520]  Earlier, I mentioned that there are episodes up on YouTube.
[29:14.300 --> 29:15.140]  If you go to YouTube and search
[29:15.140 --> 29:16.080]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[29:16.080 --> 29:19.720]  you will find the first 99-ish episodes up there.
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.280]  I hope by the time this comes out, I've got number 99 up.
[29:22.280 --> 29:24.480]  You will find about 99 old episodes
[29:24.480 --> 29:26.220]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:26.220 --> 29:29.320]  I will continue putting those up until I'm caught up.
[29:29.320 --> 29:32.040]  It does take a little bit of effort to make a YouTube video.
[29:32.040 --> 29:35.480]  It ties up my computer for whatever the video length is.
[29:35.480 --> 29:37.480]  If the podcast was 30 minutes,
[29:37.480 --> 29:38.460]  it's going to free up my computer
[29:38.460 --> 29:40.600]  for approximately three times that time.
[29:40.600 --> 29:41.780]  I have to build the video,
[29:41.820 --> 29:44.180]  and then uploading it to YouTube takes quite a while.
[29:44.180 --> 29:45.620]  But I am getting them all up there.
[29:45.620 --> 29:47.820]  Eventually, I'll have all 250,
[29:47.820 --> 29:49.560]  and then by then I'll have 300 episodes out,
[29:49.560 --> 29:50.500]  so I'll still be struggling.
[29:50.500 --> 29:51.740]  But I'm doing my best, you guys.
[29:51.740 --> 29:53.180]  Thanks for sticking with me.
[29:53.180 --> 29:54.540]  Thanks for supporting me.
[29:54.540 --> 29:56.740]  Also, speaking of support,
[29:56.740 --> 29:58.340]  let me teach you guys about Patreon.
[29:58.340 --> 30:01.340]  Patreon is a service that allows podcast listeners
[30:01.340 --> 30:03.180]  to financially contribute to the show.
[30:03.180 --> 30:04.700]  That's right, if you felt like this podcast
[30:04.700 --> 30:06.180]  was worth a couple of bucks,
[30:06.180 --> 30:07.260]  you can send it right my way.
[30:07.260 --> 30:09.620]  I'm not begging, but it does cost me a little bit
[30:09.620 --> 30:10.620]  to put out a podcast.
[30:10.620 --> 30:13.020]  I'm paying for a website where I host the show.
[30:13.020 --> 30:14.460]  I'm paying for the web service
[30:14.460 --> 30:15.740]  that I've got here at the house.
[30:15.740 --> 30:17.600]  I'm paying for these little microphone covers.
[30:17.600 --> 30:19.360]  It does cost a little bit out of my pocket.
[30:19.360 --> 30:21.460]  I can cover it, but if you would like to help,
[30:21.460 --> 30:22.580]  I would appreciate it.
[30:22.580 --> 30:25.540]  Simply go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart,
[30:25.540 --> 30:27.380]  and all of the information that you need
[30:27.380 --> 30:28.260]  will be right there.
[30:28.260 --> 30:31.700]  Once again, it's P-A-T-R-E-O-N dot com
[30:31.700 --> 30:34.980]  slash growfromyourheart, patreon.com.
[30:34.980 --> 30:36.540]  All the information you need will be right there.
[30:36.540 --> 30:38.380]  I want to send a huge thank you to everybody
[30:38.380 --> 30:41.500]  who has contributed and continues to contribute.
[30:41.500 --> 30:43.220]  That's harder to say than it sounds.
[30:43.220 --> 30:44.760]  Thanks to everyone who has contributed
[30:44.760 --> 30:48.500]  and does continue to contribute to the Patreon campaign.
[30:48.500 --> 30:51.060]  I greatly appreciate your help.
[30:51.060 --> 30:52.900]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to give me some help
[30:52.900 --> 30:54.220]  and you don't want to reach into your pocket,
[30:54.220 --> 30:55.420]  here's a really easy way to do it.
[30:55.420 --> 30:57.100]  You can go to the iTunes store,
[30:57.100 --> 30:58.980]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[30:58.980 --> 31:00.920]  There's a ratings and review section.
[31:00.920 --> 31:01.820]  Type in a little review
[31:01.820 --> 31:03.260]  and let me know what you think of the show.
[31:03.260 --> 31:06.180]  So far, everybody has given me a five-star review.
[31:06.180 --> 31:08.100]  Give me as many stars as you feel I deserve,
[31:08.820 --> 31:11.380]  and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[31:11.380 --> 31:12.760]  It's almost time to read the comments again.
[31:12.760 --> 31:14.380]  I do that about once every month.
[31:14.380 --> 31:15.900]  I'm sure there are a few gems up there
[31:15.900 --> 31:17.780]  that I need to get to.
[31:17.780 --> 31:19.220]  I'm sure that a bunch of my listeners
[31:19.220 --> 31:21.540]  are musicians or creative types.
[31:21.540 --> 31:22.620]  Maybe you're in a band.
[31:22.620 --> 31:24.220]  Maybe you've made some cool music.
[31:24.220 --> 31:25.980]  Hey, if you want me to play your music
[31:25.980 --> 31:27.620]  at the end of a podcast episode,
[31:27.620 --> 31:30.380]  send me an email, growfromyourheart at hotmail.com,
[31:30.380 --> 31:33.500]  and I will do my best to get your songs on the show.
[31:33.500 --> 31:35.140]  Maybe I'll play it when I take a dab break.
[31:35.140 --> 31:36.740]  Maybe I'll play it at the end of the show.
