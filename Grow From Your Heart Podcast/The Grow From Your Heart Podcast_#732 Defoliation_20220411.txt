[02:45.490 --> 02:50.090]  Hey Rasta Jeff, that's me. It says thanks for everything you do. Thank you, bro
[02:50.090 --> 02:55.470]  Thank you for listening and for supporting and for reaching out to make the compliment it goes on it says I love the show
[02:55.470 --> 03:01.190]  I love the vibes. That means a lot to me big up much respect putting out a good vibe is important
[03:01.190 --> 03:05.150]  It's all about the good vibes lately. There's too much not good vibes in the world
[03:05.150 --> 03:09.670]  So I want to spread the best vibes I can thank you for noticing. Thank you for spreading that vibe
[03:09.670 --> 03:13.550]  I hope you continue that vibe throughout the day after you hear the show it does go on
[03:13.550 --> 03:17.830]  It says you've helped me and so many people become better growers with your podcast
[03:18.550 --> 03:23.070]  Thank you, bro. That is the goal here and to know we are reaching the goal. That means everything
[03:23.110 --> 03:27.750]  So thank you for reminding me that I'm hitting my goal that means a lot to me that
[03:27.990 --> 03:31.230]  Inspires me that recharges me that makes me want to do it even better
[03:31.230 --> 03:37.470]  So I know that I'm reaching somebody helping somebody and so many people become better growers. Thank you, dude
[03:37.470 --> 03:42.710]  I appreciate that it goes on it says I am eternally grateful for the education and continued
[03:43.510 --> 03:44.430]  inspiration
[03:44.430 --> 03:51.470]  Keep listening keep watching bro, because I promise I will continue to educate you and the inspiration goes both ways these types of messages
[03:51.990 --> 03:58.390]  There's some inspiration in the message at the start and then there's more inspiration and motivation because you've got a question and that will help
[03:58.390 --> 04:02.430]  Keep me going. So it is teamwork. It's a symbiosis. So thank you, bro
[04:02.430 --> 04:07.030]  Thank you to the whole community for all the support. Let's keep going because I'm obviously high and rambly
[04:07.030 --> 04:14.830]  I was smoking some lemon Jeffrey live rosin from a Fort Collins grower who would probably rather remain anonymous. You may watch the show
[04:15.630 --> 04:21.450]  Awesome work, bro. I cannot stop talking when I smoke that shit awesome podcast concentrates this message
[04:21.470 --> 04:24.470]  Does go on it says just a quick follow-up on episode
[04:25.990 --> 04:29.310]  727 when you were talking about integrated pest management
[04:29.990 --> 04:36.190]  Strategies, I just wanted to share a factoid regarding the hop latent viroid on a previous episode
[04:36.190 --> 04:41.710]  I did mention hop latent viroid a virus that many grows are being struck with stricken with
[04:42.430 --> 04:44.790]  However, they're all getting this virus right now
[04:44.790 --> 04:48.950]  Everybody is encouraging or encountering this virus in a commercial grow in a home
[04:48.950 --> 04:53.590]  Grow a lot of the grows in California had to deal with this hop latent viroid
[04:53.830 --> 04:57.830]  Anyway, he says just a factoid I learned in the cannabis
[04:58.510 --> 05:02.190]  Regenerative conference big shout out to our boys at the cannabis regen conference
[05:02.230 --> 05:09.110]  They do a lot of great work support them if you can it says apparently alcohol does not kill the hop latent
[05:09.510 --> 05:16.070]  Viroid so what I said was to make sure to dunk your scissors and maybe your tools into some alcohol between plants between rows
[05:16.590 --> 05:21.070]  Apparently that's ineffective that's not going to do it. So I may have told you to waste a step
[05:21.070 --> 05:22.430]  I may have given you shitty advice
[05:22.430 --> 05:29.870]  I thought to the best of my knowledge that alcohol would sterilize your scissors and kill that virus our friends at the regenerative
[05:30.470 --> 05:38.030]  Regenerative you say that quickly our friends at the regen conference have learned and taught us that that alcohol will not kill that
[05:38.190 --> 05:43.630]  Virus it says apparently alcohol doesn't kill HLV as a cleanup strategy. It just depends
[05:43.950 --> 05:46.630]  It just spreads it around then it says
[05:48.390 --> 05:54.230]  Hypochlorous acid which is HOCI will kill the hop latent viroid just something to consider
[05:54.550 --> 06:01.790]  When cleaning those scissors from plants to plants best wishes to all from our friend Bob Bob big up big
[06:01.790 --> 06:08.110]  Thank you. Lots of good compliments. Lots of praise lots of encouragement and then a factoid and a correction in that message
[06:08.110 --> 06:11.990]  I like that. I appreciate it. Thank you. Keep the good messages coming you guys
[06:11.990 --> 06:16.570]  I may have been wrong when I said that the alcohol will fix your problem or help prevent problems
[06:16.570 --> 06:19.950]  It's not gonna do anything you have to use. What is it? Let me read it again
[06:19.950 --> 06:24.270]  I thought I remembered it when I folded the paper. I got to refer to my notes you have got to use
[06:25.870 --> 06:32.430]  Hypochlorous acid which is HOCI that will kill the HLV somebody else told me that bleach would work
[06:32.430 --> 06:33.910]  I will not testify to that
[06:33.910 --> 06:39.070]  I do not know if you've got feedback input constructive criticism or something to say about that
[06:39.070 --> 06:46.870]  Let me know will bleach work to help clean up the the tools we used that may have been contaminated with hop latent viroid
[06:46.870 --> 06:51.590]  All right. I'm already high and rambly. I don't want to get too sidetracked. I've got another message here
[06:51.590 --> 06:57.710]  This one comes from our friend Jack in Australia. What's up, Jack? Thank you for listening down there in Australia
[06:57.710 --> 07:01.210]  Should we turn upside down so you could see me properly? I'm just joking with you, bro
[07:01.210 --> 07:05.510]  I do love the the Aussie support big shout out to everybody in Australia who?
[07:06.190 --> 07:11.530]  Supports cannabis supports the podcast especially all of you rebel growers out there keep doing your thing
[07:11.550 --> 07:15.230]  I'm high as shit and super rambly this message. It has a disclaimer
[07:15.230 --> 07:20.590]  It does say you may have to edit this to make this broadcastable, but I'm good at editing this on the fly
[07:20.630 --> 07:25.510]  You speak stoner. I speak stoner. I'll add that Aussie accent to it mate will be good
[07:25.510 --> 07:31.730]  It says hey Ross to Jeff long time first time love the podcast and have learned so much from you
[07:31.730 --> 07:33.970]  I'm just gonna add the word mate in here occasionally
[07:33.970 --> 07:36.930]  He did not type the word mate, but it says thank you mate
[07:36.930 --> 07:42.070]  Then it says I remember you talking about how you would teach someone to defoliate specifically during flower
[07:42.610 --> 07:48.730]  When you were teaching that you mentioned something along the lines of anything with a purple petiole can come off
[07:48.730 --> 07:54.570]  That is something I do remember teaching practicing and saying on the podcast that is still kind of a rule that I follow
[07:54.570 --> 07:57.770]  I do believe that those purple petioles are a good indicator
[07:58.050 --> 08:01.690]  In the early flower room that those leaves can come off
[08:01.690 --> 08:03.290]  I'll keep talking about that as we go
[08:03.290 --> 08:10.410]  It says I wonder if your stance has changed or if you have more information or if you still practice this I still do this
[08:11.010 --> 08:13.010]  unfortunately with the
[08:13.730 --> 08:15.370]  Excuse me for the throat clearing
[08:15.370 --> 08:21.370]  Unfortunately with the the pandemic we had a lot of my career opportunities and career moves did change
[08:21.370 --> 08:23.650]  I left a lot of the commercial cultivation
[08:24.330 --> 08:30.850]  Consultation jobs because the commercial crews the commercial grows went down to what I was calling a skeleton crew
[08:30.850 --> 08:35.050]  There was a lead grower and then as minimal of a crew as they could handle in there
[08:35.050 --> 08:40.490]  The lead grower was doubling up his work. All the main growers were doubling up their work. We took people from working
[08:40.930 --> 08:46.690]  Eight hour shifts to working ten hour shifts that way we didn't have to have as many people coming and going from the grows
[08:46.690 --> 08:50.010]  We just had the same people there all the time to keep numbers down
[08:50.410 --> 08:55.010]  Just that was what we were doing for the the pandemic the lockdown the quarantine situation
[08:55.010 --> 08:58.810]  So when that was happening, I didn't want to be at all of these grows
[08:58.810 --> 09:02.310]  My job is to travel from two or three different grows a day
[09:02.630 --> 09:07.730]  Do one before lunch one after lunch and then try to squeeze another one in whenever I can during a day and go to these
[09:07.730 --> 09:13.250]  Different grows and see what's going on. That would put me in contact with a lot of people and during the the quarantine
[09:13.250 --> 09:19.290]  That wasn't necessary. So I just chose to I had contracts with a lot of places and around September October
[09:19.290 --> 09:22.270]  They all expired and I did not renew many of them
[09:22.270 --> 09:25.570]  I have a couple of things that I do on the side, but I'm not heavily contracted
[09:25.570 --> 09:32.890]  So I'm not in the commercial grows as much as I was but I still remember that the defoliation strategy
[09:32.890 --> 09:37.930]  Yes, anything with a purple petiole I do still employ the strategy of let's pull that off
[09:37.930 --> 09:43.530]  That's what I teach the the crew the grow text the growers in the rooms is to remove those
[09:43.530 --> 09:46.690]  There's more to this message. Let me read it so that I could stay on track
[09:46.690 --> 09:48.610]  It says I found this to be a pretty great rule
[09:48.610 --> 09:55.290]  But I would love you to do more would love you to go more into removing large amounts of fan leaves during flower
[09:55.290 --> 10:00.170]  Perhaps day 21 roughly for me on a flood and drain cocoa. He tells us about his grow
[10:00.170 --> 10:02.450]  It's still gonna be the same almost no matter how your grow is
[10:02.450 --> 10:08.570]  I'm probably gonna defoliate at certain times just depends on how intensely we will do it will be the adjustments in the anomalies
[10:09.210 --> 10:11.370]  Then he says how about schwoz?
[10:11.370 --> 10:17.290]  Or stripping a week three or day 21 a heavy doing a heavy defoliation
[10:17.290 --> 10:19.330]  Yes, all of what you're saying makes sense
[10:19.330 --> 10:20.970]  I know we'll talk about removing
[10:20.970 --> 10:24.850]  Heavy amounts of leaves since I'm thought thinking about this and we're right here at this point
[10:24.850 --> 10:30.250]  If you're going to heavily strip the room and defoliate a lot of plants in a room
[10:30.250 --> 10:31.890]  I'm used to working in large rooms
[10:31.890 --> 10:34.250]  Your spaces aren't probably as big as what I'm thinking about
[10:34.370 --> 10:37.250]  But if you're gonna work in a space and you're going to defoliate it
[10:38.250 --> 10:42.770]  My advice and I do apologize for the throat clearing I smoked rosin on a hot nail I feel good
[10:42.770 --> 10:44.970]  But I got the throat butter the lung butter
[10:45.450 --> 10:49.650]  So if you're gonna defoliate the room and you want to defoliate I'm just gonna make up a scale
[10:49.650 --> 10:54.650]  Let's say we're going to defoliate on a on a one-to-five scale. You want to hit a hard four? That's your goal, right?
[10:54.650 --> 10:59.850]  I would not defoliate. I would not start at the plant in the corner and defoliate it to a four
[10:59.850 --> 11:05.170]  I would do everything to a level two and then I would come back and do everything to a level three
[11:05.210 --> 11:08.210]  Then come back and do everything to a level four that way
[11:08.490 --> 11:13.090]  We do it in a commercial grow this way because it takes a lot more time to defoliate
[11:13.090 --> 11:19.990]  I've got multiple dudes and dudettes and non-binary folk in a room defoliating their asses off all day long
[11:19.990 --> 11:25.730]  I don't want this section of the room to be naked and no leaves in this room still to look like the 70s and be
[11:25.730 --> 11:30.570]  All bushy. I want to kind of keep it even throughout the room so that we're gonna talk more about
[11:31.530 --> 11:37.090]  Microclimates and temperature pockets and humidity pockets and things in the room. I want to prevent that so I'm going to defoliate
[11:37.490 --> 11:43.970]  evenly just do a level one strip a level two and just do it in increments instead of one section is naked one section is
[11:43.970 --> 11:45.310]  Really fuzzy
[11:45.310 --> 11:51.090]  Now you did mention the word schwoz thing that is right here in the message. I don't necessarily do a schwoz
[11:51.090 --> 11:56.290]  That is when you almost take off every leaf except those two at the top you strip almost every
[11:56.770 --> 12:01.890]  Bigger leaf with a petiole off of the plant. I don't go that hard if that is a level five
[12:01.890 --> 12:04.330]  I would say I do about a three and a half to a four
[12:04.330 --> 12:08.230]  I like to leave some leaves on there. I believe that the leaves do have a function
[12:08.230 --> 12:12.110]  They're there for a reason, but I do defoliate for a reason
[12:12.110 --> 12:17.110]  Let me talk about several of the reasons why I do choose to defoliate the plants
[12:18.070 --> 12:21.010]  the rooms and commercial environments in Colorado
[12:21.010 --> 12:28.050]  The rooms are hard to dial in large rooms and keep the the environment the conditions ideal throughout a large environment throughout a large space
[12:28.050 --> 12:34.990]  We do get the rooms somewhere between like 80 and 84 degrees and the humidity is right for the phase of growth in which we are
[12:34.990 --> 12:39.290]  In but we've got a range and if you walk through the room as you go, you could feel it's more humid here
[12:39.290 --> 12:44.470]  It's hotter here. It's not extreme. But as a grower who can identify that shit, you will notice it
[12:44.470 --> 12:48.830]  So by defoliating a lot of the leaves I can prevent a lot of the microclimates
[12:48.830 --> 12:53.370]  There's not as much is it transpiration respiration? There's not as much I should have researched this
[12:53.370 --> 12:55.450]  I'm talking really quickly also cuz I'm high as shit
[12:55.450 --> 13:01.650]  There's not as much water coming out of those leaves when I water that room not having so much water in the room
[13:02.150 --> 13:05.310]  Reduces my opportunity for powdery mildew in Colorado
[13:05.350 --> 13:11.830]  We are notorious for getting Colorado or forgetting powdery mildew every time the the season changes right now
[13:11.830 --> 13:18.390]  We're going from the cold and wintry season into the warmer spring season. It seems like it's winter one day summer the next
[13:18.390 --> 13:23.590]  We're not gonna get a spring but that type of shit creates powdery mildew if we can't dial in the rooms
[13:23.670 --> 13:29.250]  So by taking off some of the leaf and taking off some of the water in the room that will help me mitigate those issues
[13:29.310 --> 13:33.190]  Also, where do bugs and problems hide? Where does the powdery mildew go?
[13:33.190 --> 13:38.910]  Where do the spider mites go on the leaves if we take away the hotel rooms if we take away the empty beds?
[13:38.950 --> 13:41.750]  There's nowhere for the powdery mildew for the spider mites
[13:41.830 --> 13:45.710]  Whatever other insect you may run into there are less places for them to go
[13:45.710 --> 13:52.390]  So we remove the leaves from the room destroy the leaves less opportunity less campsites for the homeless spider mites to chill out in there
[13:53.070 --> 13:57.550]  Now I'm going to get back to the message because part of what you say does kind of lead into more of what I want
[13:57.550 --> 14:01.670]  To talk about it goes on it says from my own tests and seeing others work
[14:01.670 --> 14:07.990]  It seems I can increase yields and overall quality by improving airflow. Yes improving airflow definitely helps
[14:08.350 --> 14:12.710]  The plants are happier. Do you want to be in a room when you spread out your arms?
[14:12.710 --> 14:17.070]  You touch your bros everywhere you reach you can't get any of your own space that sucks
[14:17.070 --> 14:21.990]  You kind of want to open your arms sometimes stretch out you want to go to get some space the plants want to do the
[14:21.990 --> 14:27.790]  Same thing if we take off some leaves the leaves aren't dangling touching each other all the time that will help them out
[14:27.790 --> 14:33.410]  They will also prevent heat pockets. It also says it increases light penetration
[14:33.410 --> 14:38.670]  Yes, if we take off a lot of the leaves the lower buds will get more light the lower buds will get more density
[14:38.670 --> 14:40.630]  They'll get bigger stronger more potent
[14:40.630 --> 14:45.990]  You won't have to trim up that little larfy crap at the bottom there then it says and my plant seems to focus more on
[14:45.990 --> 14:51.670]  Buds themselves resulting in more dense less leafy finished product. Yes
[14:51.670 --> 14:55.370]  You're setting yourself up for success because in the end we've got to cut all the leaves off anyway
[14:55.370 --> 15:01.830]  So if we strategically start cutting those leaves off early in flower and as we go week by week take off some here some there
[15:01.830 --> 15:07.230]  So I'm here some there when it's at the end of the season. You don't have a bunch of dreadlocked furry leafy plants
[15:07.230 --> 15:13.670]  You've got less leaf to deal with. So all of your theories are accurate are correct. So let's talk about timing. I
[15:14.190 --> 15:19.190]  Like to defoliate about just like you're kind of doing it here right when we move them into flower
[15:19.190 --> 15:21.990]  I will do a pop a twist and a light defoliation
[15:22.590 --> 15:30.390]  Then around day 21 another pop a twist and a light defoliation then around week 6 another light pop twist and defoliation
[15:30.790 --> 15:36.590]  Then just slowly defoliate as we go and let the plants work and then as I begin to flush
[15:37.230 --> 15:39.730]  Seeing a commercial grow. It's hard to time everybody
[15:39.730 --> 15:42.990]  We got a crew that is trimming sometimes doing other shit
[15:42.990 --> 15:49.150]  Sometimes when I can get four or five people to go into the room that's about to be harvested. I'll send them in there to do
[15:49.870 --> 15:52.790]  Strategic defoliation take off all the leaves with petioles now
[15:52.790 --> 15:58.130]  Let's talk about why I say this remove the leaves with the petioles the petioles
[15:58.130 --> 15:59.630]  Why is that my strategy?
[15:59.630 --> 16:01.590]  Because if those petioles have turned purple
[16:01.590 --> 16:07.470]  They're probably old enough to have been on that plant for the leaf to be big enough to be blocking substantial light. That's my main
[16:08.610 --> 16:12.890]  Diagnosis my main theory behind that once that the petiole is turned purple
[16:12.890 --> 16:19.830]  The leaf is probably bigger than my hand, which means it's probably big enough to block light to the bud below it
[16:19.830 --> 16:25.310]  It's probably big enough to let off enough water to create a powdery mildew environment
[16:25.310 --> 16:31.190]  It's definitely big enough for thousands of spider mites to congregate underneath and throw a party and reproduce under there
[16:31.310 --> 16:37.270]  That purple color tells me that that leaf is just probably old enough and big enough to be removed. It's really easy
[16:37.270 --> 16:39.230]  I like to have simple
[16:39.230 --> 16:41.030]  training techniques for people
[16:41.030 --> 16:46.650]  No offense to the people who work in commercial grows a lot of you are amazing a lot of you amazing people also have
[16:46.950 --> 16:52.170]  One day a week where you're too fucking high to figure out your own life, which hey do your thing pimpin
[16:52.170 --> 16:53.990]  Sometimes I get too high to handle my own life
[16:53.990 --> 16:55.790]  I just don't do it at a commercial grow
[16:55.790 --> 17:00.490]  You get lit up and then you go in there and I've got to give you instructions and crayons a lot of times if I
[17:00.490 --> 17:03.490]  Write down those instructions and crayons and give somebody an objective
[17:03.490 --> 17:05.490]  They'll do it like a fucking robot all day
[17:05.490 --> 17:11.090]  But you have to be able to explain it to them like a puppy like they're stone like it's their first day at work
[17:11.090 --> 17:14.730]  So if I say take off all of the big leaves with the purple stem
[17:14.730 --> 17:17.250]  They'll see the purple and they'll just go start taking off leaves
[17:17.250 --> 17:19.850]  It gives them confidence and then they'll see what they did
[17:19.850 --> 17:24.010]  I could say see like you remember how it looked before do you remember how it looks now now?
[17:24.010 --> 17:28.290]  Let's go and take off a few more leaves and just clean it up a little bit and do another level and I can teach
[17:28.410 --> 17:33.490]  It's just a training technique an easy method of training the dudes the dudettes the non-binary
[17:34.330 --> 17:39.410]  Growers and grow techs. This is getting weird in the future here, but that's my way of training people
[17:39.410 --> 17:42.290]  That's why I say take off the leaves with the purple starts now
[17:42.530 --> 17:47.490]  You're your Girl Scout cookies and some of your stuff like that. The Saka souffle is gonna make purple pet eels
[17:47.810 --> 17:50.970]  They're probably gonna be real long. Those leaves are gonna be big and black
[17:50.970 --> 17:54.170]  You can leave them on for the visual, but I would probably take them off
[17:54.450 --> 17:55.730]  I do
[17:55.730 --> 18:01.290]  Probably a level one defoliation on the first day of flower like a level two and a half to three
[18:01.530 --> 18:06.370]  defoliation if one through five is our method here a five is naked and one is kind of just being lazy I do a
[18:06.370 --> 18:08.370]  Level one on day one
[18:08.370 --> 18:12.410]  Around day 14. I'll hit them with a two and a half to a three then around week six
[18:12.530 --> 18:16.290]  I'll hit them with another level three because they've bushed out again
[18:16.290 --> 18:19.290]  I'm not gonna go past that level three, but I'm gonna get it back to the three
[18:19.290 --> 18:21.770]  Give it another buzz cut make sure it's cleaned up in there
[18:21.930 --> 18:26.090]  You can do you can go kind of extreme on some plants some plants
[18:26.090 --> 18:32.890]  However will not recover from over stripping. I've had some strains that when you strip them they stall they just freeze up
[18:32.890 --> 18:34.410]  They go. I'm naked. I don't have any leaves
[18:34.410 --> 18:38.490]  I don't know what to do some plants you could do it and they will really take off and they'll really grow
[18:38.490 --> 18:44.170]  So this is going to be strain specific environment specific. There are a lot of anomalies that will factor in here
[18:44.170 --> 18:49.770]  Let me get back onto the email because there is more it says are there commercial examples of heavy defoliation?
[18:50.130 --> 18:55.090]  I've seen some commercial facilities strip them totally naked to where I would freak out
[18:55.130 --> 18:58.610]  Like I if I was the director of cultivation in that place
[18:58.610 --> 19:02.930]  I'd be writing people up and we'd be taking a class and it might be working for them
[19:02.930 --> 19:05.530]  But dude, it scares me to see that sometimes then it says
[19:06.290 --> 19:08.890]  What do you do in your garden when you're growing for flower?
[19:08.890 --> 19:14.890]  Maybe you could talk about the dangers of overdoing it and going a bit easier and non synthetic garden systems
[19:14.890 --> 19:21.050]  I don't think that synthetic and non synthetic really makes a difference at how much you defoliate. I think it's more about the genetics
[19:22.770 --> 19:24.450]  Environment your goal
[19:24.450 --> 19:26.650]  mainly the environment and the
[19:27.130 --> 19:33.090]  Natural leafiness of the plant. Is that a thing the leafiness the natural amount of leaves that that plant makes also?
[19:33.090 --> 19:37.570]  Some nutrients make a lot of leaves not as many leaves from some nudes more nudes from another
[19:37.610 --> 19:41.990]  So a lot of things could factor into this and a lot of things could factor into how many leaves you take off
[19:42.110 --> 19:48.430]  Some people don't take off any leaves some people insist that those leaves are there as solar panels and they're feeding the plants
[19:48.670 --> 19:54.790]  We're feeding the plants into the root zone. I'm spending a lot of money on bottled nutrients mixing it up pouring it into the root zone
[19:54.790 --> 19:57.250]  They're eating from there. I could tell because the leaf tips are burnt
[19:57.350 --> 20:00.070]  We don't have to worry about feeding the plant from the leaves as much
[20:00.350 --> 20:02.070]  They do work as solar panels
[20:02.070 --> 20:04.750]  You'll learn if you start watching you'll see when you remove a leaf
[20:04.750 --> 20:07.990]  You'll see where the more leaves pop up and how it moves the growth
[20:08.950 --> 20:11.590]  But overdoing it is one of the things you asked about
[20:12.670 --> 20:16.290]  Maybe you could talk about the dangers of overdoing it. Yeah, you could overdo it
[20:16.290 --> 20:21.470]  I mentioned it if you over strip on those plants just might not recover. They might not spit out more leaves
[20:21.550 --> 20:25.670]  You may have slowed them down burn them out. So my advice there is if you're gonna start
[20:26.350 --> 20:32.390]  Schwozing stripping heavily defoliating new plants if you're in control and you've got multiple plants of the same strain
[20:32.390 --> 20:35.510]  Which hopefully you're running multiple plants at the same strain so we can do an experiment
[20:35.910 --> 20:39.990]  Strip one at a level one strip one at level two strip one at level three and
[20:40.270 --> 20:43.270]  Continue all the way till ones naked so you can do some experiments
[20:43.270 --> 20:48.910]  If you don't have enough to do a lot of anomalies do one a little bit one extreme and see what you like better
[20:48.910 --> 20:53.950]  That's how we learn these plants you guys. I am NOT some sort of magical wizard. I am a Jedi
[20:53.950 --> 20:59.950]  I am a ninja, but I'm not a wizard. I don't have any magical. I don't have a magic wand or anything like that
[20:59.950 --> 21:04.670]  I've grown a lot of plants and I've tried a lot of shit. That's how I know what works and what doesn't work
[21:04.670 --> 21:08.510]  I know that when I do this and I do this to plants right next to each other
[21:08.510 --> 21:13.270]  I can take notes and I can see what works best and then I can say shouldn't do that again or should do that again
[21:13.270 --> 21:19.130]  And then I've done a lot of those experiments a lot of comparisons a lot of tests a lot of trials a lot of tribulations
[21:19.310 --> 21:22.710]  I've done full episodes about mistakes you guys I have killed plants
[21:22.710 --> 21:25.430]  I have killed I've cut down shit in the middle because I wasn't happy
[21:25.430 --> 21:30.470]  I I've killed stuff don't don't think that I'm a fucking perfection a perfect grower. I'm no wizard
[21:30.710 --> 21:35.550]  I may be a Jedi, but I'm not a perfect grower, but I've done a lot of experimenting
[21:35.550 --> 21:38.970]  I've tried a lot of things and that's how I've learned what does and what does not work
[21:39.190 --> 21:42.070]  Sometimes you got to try different things in different rooms at different spaces
[21:42.430 --> 21:47.150]  Sometimes you have to get creative and inventive sometimes the things that work for me won't work for you and your grow
[21:47.430 --> 21:53.050]  Sometimes it what works for Mike at Mike's grow or bill at Bill's grow will not work at Jack and Jill's grow
[21:53.050 --> 21:58.670]  We've all got different goals different ideas and different strategies, but don't be afraid to do some experiments
[21:58.670 --> 22:03.470]  So get in there strip the shit out of one plant kind of defoliate one and then leave another one alone
[22:03.550 --> 22:11.550]  Take a lot of notes see what works best for you. Repeat the process or repeat the experiment for more reliable data
[22:12.030 --> 22:14.110]  My dude Jack, let me wrap up your message
[22:14.110 --> 22:18.510]  It says I thought it might make a good episode and if not, I hope to hear back from you, bro
