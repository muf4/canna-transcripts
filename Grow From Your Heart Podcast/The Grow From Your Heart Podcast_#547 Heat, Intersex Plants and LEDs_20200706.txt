[00:46.580 --> 00:51.660]  Calm, you know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today
[00:51.660 --> 00:56.800]  I've been taking dabs of garlic grove live batter from green dot labs
[00:56.900 --> 01:01.660]  This is a blend of GMO cookies and LOA F2 on the package
[01:01.660 --> 01:08.960]  The flavor is described as general so's garlic and orange soda. I think I really agree with that flavor description
[01:09.140 --> 01:14.940]  There is not a potency label on the back of this package for some reason that sticker did not get put on here
[01:14.940 --> 01:18.540]  It does not need that sticker. What it should have is a fist
[01:18.540 --> 01:24.500]  There should just be a logo with a fist right there because this was the most pleasant punch to the face
[01:24.500 --> 01:28.060]  I have had in a long time when I dabbed this I
[01:28.500 --> 01:33.380]  Was immediately punched with this orange flavor this orange zestiness hit my face
[01:33.820 --> 01:39.660]  Overwhelmed my mouth then as I exhale that is when the garlic really kicks in its garlic and orange
[01:39.660 --> 01:42.500]  That's why I get why they're calling why they're calling it general so's
[01:42.700 --> 01:45.260]  It is really garlic and orangey on the exhale
[01:45.260 --> 01:50.740]  Then that garlic and a little bit of funk just hangs out on your tongue on my tongue at least for a couple of minutes
[01:50.740 --> 01:57.100]  And I really enjoy it. I'm obviously super heavily medicated from the garlic grove to be quite honest with you
[01:57.100 --> 02:01.980]  This is not the first take that I have tried to do this intro to be quite honest with you
[02:01.980 --> 02:05.660]  I set up all my recording gear had my headphones on I took a dab
[02:05.660 --> 02:11.500]  I thought I was gonna record and I found myself on the couch scrolling through social media trying to get my shit together
[02:11.500 --> 02:18.500]  So this is a quality concentrate a big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the garlic grove
[02:18.740 --> 02:20.740]  live batter
[02:20.860 --> 02:25.980]  Alright, I do have a great podcast lined up for you before we get to the email portion of the show

[03:55.900 --> 03:57.660]  Thank you guys for your support
[03:57.660 --> 04:05.180]  All right now I think it is time to move into the question and email portion of the show
[04:05.300 --> 04:11.960]  The first question I've got lined up for today's episode actually came from YouTube. I'm looking for the screenshot on my phone
[04:11.960 --> 04:16.200]  I generally do not take questions from YouTube
[04:16.200 --> 04:21.020]  I prefer to get the questions off of patreon or email. Of course patreon is the first option
[04:21.020 --> 04:25.660]  That's where I go for questions. If I get all those questions caught up, then I go to the email
[04:25.820 --> 04:29.280]  But sometimes I find good questions on the YouTube
[04:29.280 --> 04:31.000]  I'm not necessarily looking for them
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.820]  But I found a good comment there and this one has been coming up on social media quite a bit
[04:35.820 --> 04:38.620]  So I thought I would address this one. It says Rasta Jeff
[04:38.620 --> 04:42.100]  Can you tell from looking at a seed and see if it is male or female?
[04:43.140 --> 04:47.540]  I know that people are passing around a chart on social media
[04:47.540 --> 04:53.500]  it shows that if there is a volcano shape at the end of part of the seed or if there's a dimple or a
[04:53.500 --> 04:58.980]  Nipple shape or a bottlenose dolphin shape on part of the seed that it's a female if it's got another shape
[04:58.980 --> 05:00.020]  It's a male
[05:00.020 --> 05:01.540]  That is total bullshit
[05:01.540 --> 05:02.780]  If that was accurate
[05:02.780 --> 05:09.080]  Sea breeders would be fishing through every seed with the magnifying glass and we would pull out all the seeds that we wanted and give
[05:09.080 --> 05:12.720]  You all the seeds we didn't want I wouldn't do that, but that would be a thing that happened
[05:13.500 --> 05:17.100]  Nobody can tell us seeds sex by looking at the seed
[05:17.780 --> 05:22.900]  If you're going by that chart that you see on social media, you're going to be poorly sadly
[05:23.260 --> 05:27.220]  Sorely disappointed don't do that. I do not believe in that chart
[05:27.220 --> 05:31.700]  I don't know any other breeders or growers that believe in that that rely on that
[05:31.700 --> 05:38.000]  So no, I do not believe you can tell a sex of a seed just by looking at the seed
[05:38.620 --> 05:43.620]  Thanks for the great YouTube comment. Thank you for following me on YouTube big shout out to my friend Lance
[05:43.780 --> 05:49.340]  Hope you're doing well, bro. Looks like you got a kitty in your picture. I think that's a cat or is it a dog?
[05:49.340 --> 05:54.780]  I don't know bro, but I like a person with pets in their picture. So big shout out. Thank you for the great comment
[05:54.780 --> 05:56.620]  I hope I answered your question
[05:56.620 --> 06:02.380]  Next time send me an email grow from your heart at hotmail.com or even better support us on patreon patreon.com
[06:02.940 --> 06:09.020]  Forward slash grow from your heart. Alright, let's keep moving the next message came on the email
[06:09.020 --> 06:12.820]  This one came from the this one's actually from the I read genetics email
[06:13.260 --> 06:16.980]  This is an update and or a correction and it says hey brother
[06:16.980 --> 06:23.780]  I wanted to ask about your comments on BT. So in a previous episode I talked a Bennett talked about a beneficial bacteria
[06:23.780 --> 06:29.840]  I called it bacillus thuringi. I think I'm saying that correctly. If not, I'm saying it close enough
[06:29.840 --> 06:33.420]  I've never really had to say it out loud. I've only read it on packages and in books
[06:33.420 --> 06:37.780]  It's not a word you throw out in conversation. I think I'm saying it right if not, correct me
[06:37.780 --> 06:40.940]  I don't mind corrections. In fact, we've got one right here
[06:40.940 --> 06:47.860]  So it says I think BT treatments are actually BT K which killed caterpillar type critters
[06:48.380 --> 06:52.940]  Then it goes on to say for fungus gnats. I think your listener should try using BT
[06:52.940 --> 06:58.420]  I so I've been educated today that there are different strains of bacillus thuringi
[06:58.820 --> 07:03.700]  Genesis is how I think it said bacteria. There's a BT K and a BT
[07:03.700 --> 07:08.260]  I I can pronounce the BT K. It is the K stands for
[07:09.260 --> 07:11.700]  Kerstaki and the I is
[07:12.340 --> 07:17.940]  Israel and sis Israel insists it's close enough you guys we're learning in public today
[07:17.940 --> 07:21.700]  I'm just all about sounding it out, but there are two different
[07:22.300 --> 07:23.900]  bacillus BT
[07:23.900 --> 07:25.860]  Bacterias and I did not realize this
[07:25.860 --> 07:31.780]  So one is better for a caterpillar type critters and the other one is better for fungus gnats
[07:31.780 --> 07:35.500]  So that'll make it easier to shop for a more pest
[07:35.940 --> 07:38.980]  Specific product if we are applying the right pesticide
[07:38.980 --> 07:40.100]  We will have more
[07:40.100 --> 07:42.380]  Success getting rid of the pest and we will do less
[07:42.660 --> 07:49.220]  Damage to the plant because some of the pesticides and soaks and sprays they do cause slight problems and irritations to the plants
[07:49.340 --> 07:50.900]  Although they get rid of the bugs
[07:50.900 --> 07:56.340]  Sometimes they piss the plants off a little bit if we don't have to apply something or if we're applying something that's unnecessary or the wrong
[07:56.340 --> 07:59.060]  Thing we're causing more problems than we're doing good
[07:59.060 --> 08:02.700]  So if we can dial in the absolute perfect correct pesticide
[08:02.700 --> 08:08.860]  We can eradicate our problems and not cause any extra stress on the plants. That's what I'm rambling toward at this point
[08:08.860 --> 08:13.500]  Um, so it says I hope that makes sense and you definitely have more knowledge than me
[08:13.500 --> 08:18.380]  So I just wanted to ask you to make sure hey, you sound like you were well educated on this subject
[08:18.380 --> 08:23.740]  So I am ready to learn from you as well. Don't feel like I am better than you smarter than you
[08:23.940 --> 08:29.540]  I've been growing more maybe longer. I don't know, but I've just got experience and I've got a big mouth
[08:29.540 --> 08:33.940]  So I've got a show that doesn't mean you can't teach me something. I've got to keep learning constantly
[08:34.300 --> 08:39.060]  That's how I stay on top. That's how I stay ahead. It's how I stay active. It's how I stay entertained
[08:39.060 --> 08:44.340]  I wasn't learning I would just lose my mind imagine this brain not absorbing knowledge and doing something with it
[08:44.340 --> 08:48.860]  Oh, that's scary. So thank you for educating me and then it wraps up with stay
[08:48.860 --> 08:53.060]  I re brother then they signed it with baked baker on cannabis
[08:53.060 --> 08:56.940]  So if you're not already on cannabis join up on cannabis if you're already there
[08:56.980 --> 09:03.780]  Go ahead and give my buddy baked baker a follow on cannabis and of course, please give me a follow to I'm I re
[09:04.300 --> 09:08.400]  Genetics on cannabis. Hey baked baker. Thank you for the great message
[09:08.400 --> 09:15.540]  I call this one an update in a correction you guys there are more than one strain of BT beneficial bacteria
[09:15.540 --> 09:21.860]  There's the BTK which is better for caterpillars and there's the BTI which is better for fungus gnats
[09:21.860 --> 09:25.340]  So we all learned something today big shout out big. Thank you
[09:25.700 --> 09:30.740]  All right, I want to keep it moving because I do have a couple of more emails and I don't want to run out of
[09:30.740 --> 09:34.820]  Time I don't want my throat to burn out too quickly. You guys know that if I talk too long
[09:34.820 --> 09:40.060]  I will run out of my voice. So let's keep going. This one says hey Rasta Jeff
[09:40.140 --> 09:44.180]  Thank you for answering my question on the podcast regarding carbon filters
[09:44.180 --> 09:48.020]  So I'm sure you guys remember a few episodes back. I spoke about carbon filters
[09:48.020 --> 09:53.420]  It says that was cool for some reason. I heard that in a Beavis and butthead voice. That was cool
[09:53.700 --> 09:59.580]  Then it goes real quick one of my m-dog plants has sprouted a pollen sack and germinated
[09:59.580 --> 10:04.640]  I think you say you mean pollinated some buds on the lower branch near the stem
[10:04.640 --> 10:10.100]  So you've got an m-dog plant it sprouted a pollen sack. So I think it has gone hermaphrodite on you
[10:10.100 --> 10:13.820]  It's shown us some intersex traits and it is spread pollen
[10:13.820 --> 10:19.980]  So it's pollinated some buds on the lower branch near the stem the top buds seem fine
[10:20.100 --> 10:23.420]  I have run this girl many times with no herm issues
[10:24.820 --> 10:29.580]  My first question is why did it harm this time then do you know why it harmed on you this time?
[10:29.580 --> 10:33.380]  Did it have a light leak? Did you overfeed it? Did you stress it? Did it get too hot?
[10:33.540 --> 10:36.560]  What's the issue that caused it to herm? That's the first thing I want to know
[10:37.020 --> 10:42.960]  Then it goes on to say question is should I top it in case another one sprouts a pollen sack?
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.380]  So you should you talk should you chop this plant down in case it sprouts another pollen sack you're worried
[10:47.940 --> 10:52.780]  That's a good question or do you think I could let her finish with no problems it's kind of late for that
[10:52.780 --> 10:54.780]  You've already got problems
[10:56.180 --> 11:00.140]  How do I feel about that it depends on how big the plant is do you need it
[11:00.140 --> 11:05.460]  Do you need that that finished product that seeded finished product or can you live without it?
[11:05.460 --> 11:09.840]  Is it gonna hurt your budget? Is it gonna hurt your medicine supply? Is it gonna hurt your stash?
[11:10.500 --> 11:14.300]  It's a risky plant. It's a problematic plant, but is it worth the reward?
[11:14.300 --> 11:18.320]  That's when you've got away the risk reward the problem to the payoff
[11:18.320 --> 11:23.860]  Is it worth the bullshit that it's gonna give you it's kind of laid in already. So you're worried about
[11:24.820 --> 11:29.660]  Trying to finish it without problems brought already pollinated your crop. I'm not sure what the rest of your problems could be
[11:31.420 --> 11:38.020]  Then you say that it in the previous part you said that it pollinated the lower parts and you don't think the tops got it
[11:38.020 --> 11:40.140]  I hate to burst your bubble buddy
[11:40.140 --> 11:45.900]  But a lot of times when you see a couple of seeds that means there are a lot of seeds you do not see
[11:45.900 --> 11:46.860]  As a breeder
[11:46.860 --> 11:52.860]  I know that the outside seeds are just the the tip of the iceberg so to speak and once you break open those buds
[11:53.060 --> 11:57.860]  There's fucking seeds in there. So you may have a lot more seeds than what you're thinking. You've got
[11:58.420 --> 12:02.060]  You want to know if you should chop it in case it gets more pollen sacks?
[12:02.780 --> 12:05.980]  It may make it may do that it could make more pollen
[12:05.980 --> 12:11.980]  But is it too late to pollinate the rest of the room are the plants that are in the room already past their?
[12:12.180 --> 12:19.580]  Pollination point have the the the pistols have they curled up or the hairs are they brown and nasty looking at that point?
[12:19.580 --> 12:23.780]  They're past peak pollination. I'm not sure how far into flower you are
[12:23.780 --> 12:30.020]  Wait, we can find out because it says I have about 10 more days to hit eight weeks. So that means you're
[12:30.140 --> 12:35.860]  Seven more days three you're in week the end of week six. You're at a really critical part here
[12:36.420 --> 12:41.860]  You're gonna have a lot of seeds and the seeds that you made are probably gonna also
[12:41.860 --> 12:45.780]  And they could possibly be hermaphroditic. You could have some gems in there, but that's not what you're worried about
[12:46.340 --> 12:50.020]  You're wondering if you should cut it down. You're a week six by the time I read this
[12:51.100 --> 12:53.980]  You've probably gotten close to the end of harvest right now
[12:53.980 --> 12:59.660]  But I would almost just cut that fucker down because it's stressful and you're not gonna be able to get a lot of seeds
[12:59.660 --> 13:04.180]  So I would just cut it down a little bit more stressful and make sure it doesn't cause me more problems
[13:04.180 --> 13:07.820]  But also keep in mind there are probably a lot of seeds happening in your crop
[13:07.820 --> 13:13.060]  So it says I'd be happy with one more week or do you think it's a gamble and just chop her now?
[13:14.780 --> 13:19.660]  Do you have a perpetual grow going if all of your plants are at the same cycle
[13:20.300 --> 13:26.300]  The ones right around this plant are gonna have some pollen or some seeds in there. Hopefully the rest of them aren't too seeded
[13:26.300 --> 13:28.300]  If you've got more plants a
[13:28.460 --> 13:31.620]  Earlier stage and you've got more plants that are coming in and staggering
[13:31.620 --> 13:35.580]  You do have the opportunity to keep pollinating your future crops
[13:35.580 --> 13:40.740]  So if you've got more shit going on, I would get rid of it because you're just gonna continue the problem
[13:41.140 --> 13:49.020]  The plants that are in there have probably already been pollinated or are past their peak pollination point their past ovulation
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.500]  They probably can't take pollen any further at this point
[13:52.100 --> 13:58.380]  But you're at like week six week seven, so I'm not sure what they look like maybe they can receive pollen right now I
[13:59.020 --> 14:03.860]  Would cut this plant down I would think about what caused it to hermaphrodite. Why did it flip on you?
[14:03.860 --> 14:07.140]  What it's probably something you caused. I don't want to point a finger
[14:07.140 --> 14:11.620]  I don't want to blame you but you say it ran fine a couple of times now. It's herming on you
[14:11.820 --> 14:16.460]  What did you do? Was there a light leak? Was there an issue? Like I said earlier, did you overfeed it?
[14:16.460 --> 14:18.460]  We need to figure out what caused the herm
[14:18.780 --> 14:22.700]  Then you need to think about do you want to risk this same problem in the next grow?
[14:22.700 --> 14:25.660]  We know this plant is problematic like this dog bites
[14:25.660 --> 14:29.420]  Do you want to keep put it on a fucking leash and taking it to the dog park and having to pull it off other?
[14:29.420 --> 14:34.980]  Dogs, I don't think so. I would fucking get rid of it, dude. That's what I would do. I would just chop it right now
[14:35.060 --> 14:40.260]  I've got a very different approach to gardening than a lot of people. I also have access to a lot of genetics
[14:40.780 --> 14:45.060]  When I cut this one down I get to grow something else in its place something that is not a hermaphrodite
[14:45.340 --> 14:47.940]  Something that does not give me problems something
[14:47.940 --> 14:52.380]  I don't want to kick if this plant accidentally pollinated my crop on a kick it I'm mad at it
[14:52.380 --> 14:56.140]  So it would be gone. It would already be in a fucking trash can if this were me, so
[14:56.740 --> 15:02.100]  It depends on how much you love this plant how much you need the medicine off of this plant and how much you want to give
[15:02.100 --> 15:02.700]  Yourself a headache
[15:02.700 --> 15:07.460]  I think I decided halfway through reading this that cut that fucking thing down get rid of it
[15:07.460 --> 15:10.600]  Stop fighting yourself and set yourself up for success. That's what I want to say
[15:10.600 --> 15:14.940]  That's the answer that I would go with but I don't know how bad you need the medicine or the product
[15:14.940 --> 15:15.940]  so
[15:15.940 --> 15:18.560]  That is my advice cut it down cut your losses
[15:18.820 --> 15:24.420]  Quit fucking up the rest of the grow with the problematic plant and replace it with something that is not problematic
[15:25.180 --> 15:30.700]  All right. Let's see if you put your name in there. You did not say your name so, you know who you are, man
[15:31.100 --> 15:33.940]  Thank you for the great message and let me know how this goes
[15:33.940 --> 15:36.520]  Send me a follow-up and I will read it on the show
[15:36.520 --> 15:39.620]  I want to know what you chose to do and how the outcome came and
[15:40.260 --> 15:43.300]  How many seeds did you get and what are you gonna do with the seeds?
[15:43.300 --> 15:49.420]  Please don't share these seeds until you've grown them yourself until you know if they're problematic or if they're amazing
[15:49.700 --> 15:54.260]  You know what? I'm talking about. Don't share crappy seeds. And since they came from a crappy plant
[15:54.260 --> 15:59.380]  I'm not calling your plant crappy, but it harmed on you. That's crappy since they came from a questionable crappy plant
[15:59.380 --> 16:05.220]  They're questionable crappy seeds in my mind. I think I covered all the notes. I wrote on that one
[16:05.220 --> 16:09.120]  Why did it harm figure that out? Probably a light leak probably overfeed it
[16:09.360 --> 16:15.160]  They're probably more seeds than you think it may keep making pollen. It could pop up more pollen sacks
[16:15.880 --> 16:18.400]  But it could be too late to pollinate the rest of the room
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.580]  If you've got a perpetual cycle going on the rest of its gonna just keep getting pollinated
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.560]  I would call that fucker and get rid of it. Alright that wraps it up. Thank you for that one
[16:27.600 --> 16:34.040]  Let's move forward to another email. This one starts off with good morning. Good evening
[16:34.040 --> 16:35.640]  It is definitely not morning time here
[16:35.640 --> 16:40.680]  I hope you're smoking a fat bull whatever time it is wherever you are. It goes on to say
[16:41.440 --> 16:45.680]  Funny story I came down to write you an email and noticed the new podcast
[16:45.680 --> 16:50.400]  I love that when people go to write me a message or send me a tweet or something and there's a brand new episode for
[16:50.400 --> 16:53.000]  Them to check out always puts a smile on people's face
[16:53.000 --> 16:58.200]  It goes on to say I just so happened it just so happened you answered my last question
[16:58.200 --> 17:03.240]  Oh, oh, that's fucking awesome. You went to write me a message and as you were writing it I answered your last question
[17:03.240 --> 17:08.480]  I love stuff like that synchronicities you guys there is no that that stuff supposed to happen
[17:08.480 --> 17:14.080]  It goes on to say I had a small chuckle at the way things work sometimes. Yes me too, my friend one thing
[17:14.080 --> 17:20.040]  I will clarify about the last email when I was talking about RO and calcium buildup. I meant our water in
[17:20.640 --> 17:24.600]  Humidifiers. Oh, yeah, it says I know if you put tap water in them
[17:24.600 --> 17:28.980]  They will start to build white powder on the walls from the calcium in the water or so
[17:28.980 --> 17:30.980]  That is what I had read
[17:31.060 --> 17:35.420]  Not only will it start to build up calcium on the walls possibly but you will ruin the filters
[17:35.620 --> 17:41.220]  The filters will get clogged up with the calcium quite quickly. So it goes on to say where were we where were we?
[17:42.340 --> 17:44.340]  aha
[17:45.580 --> 17:51.580]  Okay, the cutting out of the root ball and living soil was more along the lines of what I was looking into and actually found
[17:51.580 --> 17:57.380]  A way with these rapid stack pots. So apparently there was another part of the question about living soil
[17:57.660 --> 18:03.220]  But here is the part that we need to address on today's episode it says anyway, here is my problem
[18:03.920 --> 18:06.660]  venting from my ceiling into my basement
[18:07.300 --> 18:10.780]  Unfortunately, the excess heat has caused my house to heat up too much
[18:10.780 --> 18:13.980]  Yes, sometimes those grow lights will heat up the house quite a bit
[18:14.020 --> 18:19.380]  It says I have attempted to move it around within the same circuit and use my dryer exhaust
[18:19.380 --> 18:21.380]  But then it started to blow breakers
[18:22.340 --> 18:25.000]  That puts off so many things. I want to talk about in my head
[18:25.960 --> 18:31.400]  If you're flipping breakers, you are definitely putting your house in danger. You're putting everybody in risk. Be careful doing that
[18:31.400 --> 18:33.400]  I shouldn't have to preach too much about that
[18:33.400 --> 18:36.520]  What's happening is the breakers heating up so much that it goes, huh?
[18:36.520 --> 18:41.200]  I got a quick run because I'm pulling way too much electricity and this could cause a problem. So the breaker flips
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.760]  But every time that happens the wires are heating up hot enough to flip that breaker
[18:46.320 --> 18:52.280]  Eventually the coating on the outside of the wires the polyurethane stuff will melt two wires will touch you'll have a fire
[18:53.120 --> 18:56.920]  That'll take a while, but eventually that she will happen. I don't know how old your house is
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.520]  I don't know what kind of wiring you have if you've got old wiring in a really old house
[19:00.560 --> 19:05.280]  You've got a much more potential for starting a fire if you've got a new house still run a risk
[19:05.280 --> 19:08.120]  But it's not as bad. So be careful if you're flipping breakers
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.680]  Another thing that comes to mind is you said you tried to run it through the dryer exhaust which makes me think you were
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.040]  Tying in your grow exhaust into the dryer vent exhaust
[19:18.560 --> 19:24.080]  That's not a good idea either it doesn't sound like a big deal but never really modify the
[19:24.280 --> 19:30.800]  Exhaust system in a home whether it comes to the dryer exhaust or the HVAC system those systems were designed
[19:31.200 --> 19:34.840]  Very specifically for the flow of the house and the heating and cooling equipment
[19:35.120 --> 19:39.480]  If you go tying in another duct that was not planned for you're going to create
[19:40.200 --> 19:45.720]  Opportunities for backflow air that shouldn't go a certain way should have never gone a certain way will now go a certain way
[19:45.880 --> 19:47.880]  You'll disrupt the airflow of everything
[19:48.200 --> 19:56.240]  You've either got the opportunity of blowing the warm air from your grove into cool spaces or blowing the cool air into warm spaces
[19:56.360 --> 20:00.160]  It's gonna go the wrong way because it's not how it was meant to go
[20:00.480 --> 20:04.520]  Also, you'll end up with dryer lint in your grow if that shit goes wrong
[20:04.560 --> 20:08.400]  Nobody wants a dryer lint in the grow. You don't want to be picking that shit out of your buds
[20:08.400 --> 20:10.400]  I don't know that that'll really happen, but
[20:11.080 --> 20:14.640]  Don't tie those in and don't fuck up the electricity. You got to be safer than that
[20:14.880 --> 20:17.080]  So let's keep going. Where are we?
[20:17.080 --> 20:24.360]  I also now can use my I also now cannot use my dehumidifier as that pumped out too much heat
[20:24.880 --> 20:30.120]  And you're cranking up a lot of heat in a little space. It says so now my room is running at 28 degrees Celsius and
[20:30.840 --> 20:38.080]  45% relative humidity daytime and nighttime is about 23 or 24 degrees Celsius with about 52%
[20:38.800 --> 20:42.400]  Relative humidity, so you're not dropping too much for your night temperature
[20:42.400 --> 20:45.840]  But you're getting a little bit more humidity and they're not extreme. It's gonna be okay
[20:48.200 --> 20:51.400]  You're gonna have to remove the heat you have to duct it a different way
[20:51.400 --> 20:54.240]  I would duct it outside or add an air conditioner
[20:54.240 --> 20:57.400]  You're either gonna have to move that duct that you tried to tie into the dryer
[20:57.400 --> 21:01.440]  You're gonna have to run it outside somehow. Um, I don't know what your opportunity is
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.320]  Do you have a fireplace run it into the fireplace and I'll go up the fireplace and out the chimney
[21:05.560 --> 21:10.560]  Or use a window seal up the window put a hole in a board or a piece of insulation or however
[21:10.560 --> 21:14.280]  You can seal the window then make a six or an eight inch hole run a blower out through there
[21:14.280 --> 21:18.900]  Make sure to use a carbon filter, but you're gonna have to get rid of the heat or add an air conditioner
[21:19.040 --> 21:21.120]  You're not just gonna be able to blow heat around
[21:21.640 --> 21:24.800]  You're just gonna heat up the whole house. I don't know how big your house is
[21:24.800 --> 21:28.880]  I do know that it's going to come up and tell me how big the grow is. So let's keep going
[21:29.200 --> 21:34.920]  It says I've done a bit of reading on co2. I know with extra co2 they can handle higher heat
[21:34.920 --> 21:37.840]  So I believe this is the route I'm going to have to take
[21:38.680 --> 21:40.680]  Before I read too much further I
[21:41.520 --> 21:47.120]  Just want to say that this is probably not the best solution. This is more like a band-aid
[21:47.120 --> 21:49.280]  You're not really fixing the heat problem
[21:49.280 --> 21:54.600]  You're just kind of covering it up with something else that costs more money and is an experiment. You don't want to
[21:55.240 --> 22:03.720]  Rely on co2 bags those little make your own co2 mushroom bags and shit. Those aren't going to provide enough co2 to
[22:04.720 --> 22:08.680]  Supplement the to fix the heat problem. It's not gonna band-aid that shit enough
[22:08.680 --> 22:13.960]  You're gonna have to get the co2 bottles and a system and turn it up a real high to get enough co2 in there to
[22:14.040 --> 22:17.960]  Mitigate that heat issue the issue the solution is to correct the heat
[22:18.320 --> 22:23.840]  Don't don't create more problems and spend more money on the wrong shit by just buying a mask and a band-aid
[22:23.840 --> 22:25.840]  We want to actually solve the problem
[22:25.960 --> 22:30.240]  Or at least that's what I would do. You can do whatever you want, but I wouldn't I wouldn't go that route
[22:31.200 --> 22:35.320]  Then it says how much would I need for a 4x4 and a 2x4 tent
[22:36.000 --> 22:38.240]  That kind of set off some weird bells in my head
[22:38.360 --> 22:44.460]  How much light are you running in a 4x4 and a 2x4 that it is heating up your entire house?
[22:44.600 --> 22:48.380]  I've got questions. I would like to see your setup a little bit
[22:48.380 --> 22:53.320]  I would like to see how you've got the tent set up how you're running the ducting where you're running it
[22:53.320 --> 22:56.640]  I want to see what's going on. I can give you a lot of guidance and advice
[22:57.360 --> 23:03.560]  That's a really small area of grow space and you shouldn't have an extreme amount of light in there
[23:03.680 --> 23:09.240]  At the biggest in that 4x4 maybe you've got a thousand which is pushing it and in that 2x4
[23:09.240 --> 23:12.920]  What do you got in there like a 400 maybe a 6 you shouldn't have?
[23:13.880 --> 23:17.920]  2,000 that's a lot of light for that little bit of space. You shouldn't have a whole lot of bang and light
[23:17.920 --> 23:20.920]  This shouldn't be too hard to cool. I'm sure with a little bit of
[23:22.200 --> 23:26.240]  Knowledge from an experienced grower someone who has set up a lot of rooms. I'm sure we could cool this down
[23:26.640 --> 23:30.080]  Quite a bit without doing the co2 idea
[23:30.160 --> 23:35.640]  Then it says would it be better to exhaust my flower tent into the long room or keep the whole thing and closed?
[23:36.080 --> 23:38.880]  I don't think that the co2 is the way to go
[23:38.880 --> 23:40.720]  but if you're gonna do co2
[23:40.720 --> 23:46.080]  Put the two tents in one room and fill that whole room with co2 and just keep the co2 moving or put the co2
[23:46.080 --> 23:50.440]  Straight in the tents, but it's gonna duct out of there if you've got the tent in a room
[23:50.440 --> 23:54.680]  So just do the whole you're gonna have to augment the entire room is what you'll have to do. So
[23:55.120 --> 23:57.120]  um
[23:57.200 --> 24:03.680]  Yeah, you're gonna have to I would reduce the heat don't even do the co2 reduce the heat work on removing the heat or adding
[24:03.680 --> 24:09.120]  An air conditioner the co2 in my opinion is a band-aid and if it gets a little bit hotter
[24:09.120 --> 24:10.960]  How many more band-aids you're gonna put on there?
[24:10.960 --> 24:15.680]  You can't just keep adding co2 the correct thing to do is to fix the problem in my opinion
[24:15.680 --> 24:21.220]  You can keep trying to battle the heat or you can get the appropriate equipment to correct the heat now
[24:21.220 --> 24:26.860]  It says that you're flipping breakers. You're gonna have to be really careful. How much lighter you run it, dude
[24:26.860 --> 24:30.940]  I'm really confused and I'm not trying to disrespect your grow. That's a 4x4 and a 2x4
[24:30.980 --> 24:35.940]  You can't have too many watts going on in there. So I'm really curious. Please send me an update
[24:36.060 --> 24:39.780]  Let me know what's going on in this grow so I can give you more guidance more advice
[24:39.780 --> 24:42.300]  Get you a little bit more dialed in cool down your room a little bit
[24:42.780 --> 24:47.220]  Maybe we can figure out how to run your equipment more efficiently off of the electricity that you've got
[24:47.740 --> 24:54.800]  Because I'm pretty sure most people can't augment the electricity in their house, but I look forward to oh this one's from Tonto also
[24:54.800 --> 24:59.140]  Yeah, I look forward to a follow-up and it also says PS if any of this is unclear
[24:59.140 --> 25:00.900]  Please let me know and I will clarify
[25:00.900 --> 25:04.900]  Dude, I want pictures if you can send me a video just walk through and be like this is what's going on
[25:04.940 --> 25:09.820]  That would really help me out. That would help us both out and I will follow up with some updates
[25:09.820 --> 25:13.740]  All right, big shout out to my buddy Tonto. Thank you for the great message again
[25:13.740 --> 25:17.540]  If you've got an email question a cannabis culture a cannabis cultivation question
[25:17.540 --> 25:24.620]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com. I want to keep it moving. I'm having fun on this episode
[25:24.620 --> 25:29.880]  Here is another message. This one came from this one came from the grow from your heart email
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.460]  It says hey Jeff. I'm the French dude that you answered the question about the light leaks on your show a few months ago
[25:35.460 --> 25:38.780]  I think I remember that it says it was October. I think I
[25:39.420 --> 25:43.420]  Remember answering a lot of questions about light leaks, but it goes on to say here
[25:43.420 --> 25:48.220]  I am again still listening to your awesome show almost every day. Thank you. I appreciate that
[25:48.220 --> 25:51.060]  It says lately because of this kovat lockdown shit
[25:51.060 --> 25:57.460]  I was happier than ever to listen to your show because it is good to have your positivity and enthusiasm in this time
[25:57.820 --> 26:01.580]  You have helped a lot dude. That means a lot to me. Thank you
[26:01.580 --> 26:06.700]  I know as a content provider that people kind of turn to us for just an escape a getaway
[26:06.820 --> 26:09.840]  Not only are you getting some sort of knowledge, but you're just escaping
[26:09.840 --> 26:13.380]  You're not thinking about all the the kovat shit or the dumb shit that's going on in your life
[26:13.380 --> 26:15.780]  I won't bring any of it up so you don't think about it right now
[26:15.980 --> 26:19.860]  But thank you for noticing and thank you for the for mentioning that
[26:19.980 --> 26:22.940]  But I was dealing with kovat and quarantine and all that shit as well
[26:22.940 --> 26:28.460]  But I was using podcasting as an outlet to communicate with people and keep myself occupied
[26:28.460 --> 26:34.220]  So I'm glad you guys were using my work as something to entertain yourselves that worked out very well for both of us
[26:34.940 --> 26:40.840]  It goes on to say my question today is about lighting I've said it so many times I'm not a lighting expert
[26:41.300 --> 26:43.300]  Lighting is where I am the most
[26:44.180 --> 26:47.700]  Uneducated when it comes to cannabis cultivation. I am NOT a lighting expert
[26:47.700 --> 26:50.460]  There's a lot for me to learn when it comes to lighting
[26:50.820 --> 26:55.060]  Keith has taught me a little bit about lights a couple of other people have tried to teach me a lot about lights
[26:55.380 --> 26:59.860]  My brain doesn't absorb that stuff the way that it absorbs the plant stuff. So
[27:00.560 --> 27:03.940]  Hopefully I can answer your lighting question, but I just wanted to be completely honest
[27:03.940 --> 27:10.060]  It goes on to say I grow in a 2 by 2 foot tent with a hundred and twenty watt LED and it says actual power
[27:10.420 --> 27:15.620]  120 watts I am pretty satisfied with it for both flowering and the growth phase
[27:15.620 --> 27:22.540]  But I'd like to add a little boost because sometimes you just want a little bit more light more growth and more bud
[27:22.540 --> 27:25.780]  Yes, we all want more growth and more bud and a good way to get that is more light
[27:25.820 --> 27:29.740]  It says I'm aiming for something like a 200 watt for the whole tent
[27:29.900 --> 27:35.100]  Even though I know that talking in watts is not really accurate. I'm really glad you said that
[27:35.540 --> 27:42.380]  There are many ways to measure lights and I don't think that watts are the way to measure them accurately for plants
[27:42.380 --> 27:47.460]  I don't think plants know what watts even are they don't care. They want the right spectrum
[27:47.460 --> 27:52.180]  I think you moles per joule is the proper measurement. All right, let me quit talking out of my ass and we'll get back on track
[27:52.180 --> 27:56.380]  Here it says do you have any advice on supplemental lighting?
[27:56.380 --> 27:58.580]  I thought about adding some LED bars
[27:58.900 --> 28:05.100]  Something like one bar for grow and one bar for flowering or maybe a CFL full spectrum bulb
[28:05.100 --> 28:06.420]  I wouldn't do the CFL
[28:06.420 --> 28:07.820]  I would prefer the LEDs
[28:07.820 --> 28:13.200]  But it is pretty difficult to know which direction to go nowadays with all the information on the web
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.740]  I tried the forums, but I remembered what you said about grow advice on the forums in general
[28:18.660 --> 28:20.380]  There is a lot of bullshit on there
[28:20.380 --> 28:20.700]  Yes
[28:20.700 --> 28:27.420]  the people that own light companies go and they comment like they're just users and consumers and then people that don't know anything about
[28:27.420 --> 28:33.220]  Growing they say that they had a problem or great success with the certain light and it was just a fluke because something else
[28:33.220 --> 28:36.020]  In their grow was what was magical or what was wrong?
[28:36.220 --> 28:41.580]  So you have to be really good at fishing through bullshit when you were getting advice on forums
[28:41.820 --> 28:47.060]  So he says I figured why not simply ask my buddy from overseas Rasta Jeff
[28:47.060 --> 28:50.980]  It says so if by any chance you read this email, I'd be really glad to get some help from you
[28:51.140 --> 28:56.420]  Stay safe your buddy Rick from France. What up Rick from France. Thank you for the great message
[28:56.500 --> 28:59.860]  It's great to know that I've got people over in France listening to the podcast
[29:00.340 --> 29:05.660]  Let's talk a little bit about some grow light advice for my friend Rick
[29:06.420 --> 29:10.940]  It sounds like you are close to having enough light in that 2x2 tent
[29:11.500 --> 29:14.580]  It sounds like you want to almost double up the amount of light
[29:14.580 --> 29:18.460]  I would if you're gonna do it, I would double up during veg and flour
[29:18.460 --> 29:23.900]  There's no reason to have certain amount of light at one point and then not have full power for the whole cycle
[29:23.900 --> 29:25.180]  Just go full power the whole time
[29:25.180 --> 29:27.620]  So whatever you're gonna buy make sure you've got the electricity
[29:28.020 --> 29:33.820]  To run that light both lights all of the lights make sure you've got enough power like our listener before
[29:33.820 --> 29:36.660]  They're flipping breakers in their house when they try to run all their gear
[29:36.660 --> 29:43.100]  Make sure you've got the electricity the next thing make sure you're able to cool it like our listener before it's too hot in their
[29:43.100 --> 29:49.060]  House, they can't cool it make sure able to cool it with those two things being thought about and heavily considered
[29:49.100 --> 29:54.060]  Let's talk about a couple of lights. You've got a 2x2. I would put one
[29:54.580 --> 30:00.100]  Canon LED from black sale market in that 2x2 and it would be fucking awesome
[30:00.420 --> 30:03.020]  It would be more light than you need. That's a
[30:03.700 --> 30:07.340]  325 watt light and I think it would light up your 2x2
[30:07.900 --> 30:10.900]  Beautifully, I think a cannon is perfect for a 3x3
[30:10.900 --> 30:15.540]  It is going to light up your 2x2 and your plants are going to go kaboom kapow
[30:15.980 --> 30:21.460]  So I would try I would recommend about 300 watts and that 2x2 maybe a little bit less
[30:21.460 --> 30:27.300]  I think 200 watts total will be right about where you want to be the cannons. You can dial them down
[30:27.300 --> 30:31.380]  They've got a little knob. It's hidden but it's there Keith will show you where it is
[30:31.380 --> 30:34.340]  It may be in the instruction book. I didn't read the instruction book
[30:34.500 --> 30:39.020]  Apologize and I admit it but there's a little knob you can use a screwdriver and you can turn down the wattage
[30:39.060 --> 30:42.100]  So you can get it down to 200 watts. I think it goes that low
[30:42.100 --> 30:45.100]  You can play with the wattage and you can get it dialed in for your plants
[30:45.140 --> 30:48.620]  The only thing to consider is ceiling height as long as you've got enough height
[30:48.620 --> 30:54.640]  I think a cannon would be wonderful for you. If not, I would find something with a good reputation
[30:54.640 --> 30:59.540]  I would do a lot of research and I would find something around 200 watts for your space
[30:59.540 --> 31:03.220]  It sounds like 200 watts would be just about perfect for your square footage
[31:03.780 --> 31:07.260]  I honestly do not know enough about LED lights
[31:07.820 --> 31:13.420]  Nobody pays me to recommend lighting. Nobody pays me to talk about LEDs. I'm not sponsored by an LED company
[31:13.420 --> 31:19.540]  I do have Canon LEDs. I grow with them and they work beautifully. My plants are fucking happy
[31:19.540 --> 31:25.420]  The growth is beautiful. I should have flowered earlier because they took off in veg. I wasn't prepared for that
[31:25.420 --> 31:31.260]  They got kind of tall and flower. That was my fault. Those lights made the plants grow super super quickly
[31:31.260 --> 31:37.700]  So I recommend the Canon LED from Black Sale. I think you can get them. You said friend from overseas or in France
[31:37.700 --> 31:39.700]  I think they are available in
[31:40.060 --> 31:45.300]  France Keith if I am wrong, please send me an update. I'd like to give accurate information about your brand
[31:45.300 --> 31:52.180]  I recommend you check out Black Sale market. They have got a website. Just Google Black Sale market Black Sale LED
[31:52.180 --> 31:55.820]  You will find them on Keith is a great dude. He's really easy to work with
[31:56.300 --> 32:01.500]  I don't work with companies if they're not easy to work with like I've got a lot of opportunities
[32:01.500 --> 32:06.780]  There are a lot of products or a lot of vendors a lot of brands and if your product has to be fucking top-notch
[32:06.820 --> 32:11.020]  That's the most important part. But if your product is top-notch and you're a dick
[32:11.020 --> 32:14.900]  I still may not use your product if your product is top-notch and you're cool as shit
[32:14.900 --> 32:19.020]  I'm buying your shit and talking about you on my show. So Keith big fist bump, bro
[32:19.020 --> 32:24.580]  I approve of your product you guys Black Sale market Canon LEDs. They're fucking awesome big
[32:24.580 --> 32:26.500]  Thanks to my buddy Rick from France
[32:26.500 --> 32:31.500]  I appreciate knowing that I've got friends out there in France and I appreciate knowing that I'm helping you out in your garden and
[32:31.500 --> 32:39.420]  I look forward to hearing from you again in the future if anybody else out there has any cannabis culture or cannabis cultivation questions
[32:39.420 --> 32:40.620]  You know, I would love to hear from you
[32:40.620 --> 32:43.740]  My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[32:43.980 --> 32:46.540]  Also, if you want to get your message right to the top of the list
[32:46.540 --> 32:53.060]  Go check out patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart and learn how to get your email right to the top of the list
[32:53.060 --> 32:58.940]  Via patreon. All right. Oh, I've got one more thing to talk about. I almost forgot. I got a question on YouTube
[32:58.940 --> 33:00.900]  Let's get to this one. I got to find it here in the phone
[33:00.900 --> 33:02.540]  This is my version of being organized
[33:02.540 --> 33:06.220]  It says and I got more than one message like this or I would have ignored it
[33:06.220 --> 33:07.980]  But I think it is time to address this one
[33:07.980 --> 33:13.620]  It says man, I'd like to see your dreads sometime and I know it's a pain to get long dreads in the camera
[33:13.620 --> 33:15.620]  But maybe just for a minute at the end of an episode
[33:15.980 --> 33:22.780]  I would just like to see the texture size and shape that is kind of a weird odd request
[33:22.780 --> 33:27.100]  But it's been asked so many times that I think it is time to bust out the dreadlocks for you guys
[33:27.100 --> 33:28.940]  It feels a little bit weird. It's a gross show
[33:28.940 --> 33:33.980]  But so I've got them tied in a knot tie it untie that part and then I've got a hair tie
[33:33.980 --> 33:38.580]  It's actually a fucking headband that works as a hair tie, but I've got that they're tied up in here
[33:38.580 --> 33:43.740]  They pull out the hair tie and here's some dreadlocks you guys this hat is too big, but it's comfortable as shit
[33:45.060 --> 33:50.060]  I'm showing you the dress trying to get it going you guys that are only listening on audio. I apologize
[33:50.060 --> 33:51.580]  You're gonna have to watch the YouTube channel
[33:51.580 --> 33:56.920]  Go to YouTube search for the grow from your heart podcast and check out this episode and see the dreadlocks if you're interested
[33:57.180 --> 34:01.960]  So I've got them all they're down. They're hanging down. I'm gonna show you the what did you want to see the
[34:03.820 --> 34:08.580]  The texture size and shape so I got a couple I'm gonna say there's a couple of different textures
[34:08.580 --> 34:13.280]  These are more uniform the smaller ones. That's the texture and size and shape
[34:13.280 --> 34:16.220]  I guess these are like my common size ones and then I got a couple
[34:16.660 --> 34:22.580]  This one that comes from let me get natural direction some of this may get edited more I may just leave all this in the show
[34:23.180 --> 34:28.000]  I'm getting real comfortable with the video show you guys if you haven't noticed you got a couple of thick ones like this
[34:29.020 --> 34:33.060]  Yeah, let me get this going. This one's real thick here. This one is
[34:34.820 --> 34:42.540]  Almost the diameter of a can of butane I guess it's it's thinner but I mean, you know, it's comparable so and
[34:43.260 --> 34:45.180]  I measured as a joke
[34:45.180 --> 34:49.260]  I don't know if I'm supposed to say this because a friend is doing a giveaway based on the length of my dreads, bro
[34:49.260 --> 34:54.720]  I hope your giveaway is done before this podcast comes out. My longest dread was 49 inches long
[34:54.720 --> 34:57.020]  We measured with the tape measure 49 inches
[34:57.900 --> 35:02.180]  So I'll stand up and show you I'll also try to get somebody to snap a photo for me
[35:02.540 --> 35:05.220]  So that I've got a good stand up from the back kind of a picture
[35:05.540 --> 35:08.460]  It's hard to do it right here with this camera just on the the MacBook
[35:08.460 --> 35:10.340]  But I'm stand up show you the dreads
[35:10.340 --> 35:11.940]  You won't be able to hear me for a moment
[35:11.940 --> 35:17.420]  But if you're listening on iTunes or Apple podcast or stitcher, I invite you to come check us out on the video
[35:17.420 --> 35:19.420]  Here we go. Show the dreads real quick
[35:39.090 --> 35:41.370]  Also, I'm six five and they go to my knees
[35:41.970 --> 35:46.210]  So there's a lot of stuff to work with. That's why you see them tied up almost all the time
[35:46.210 --> 35:51.250]  I let them down at concerts and when I'm when I'm not doing stuff, you know
[35:51.250 --> 35:54.830]  But it's hard to have all this hanging from your head all the time and you're trying to work in a garden or something
[35:54.830 --> 35:57.210]  So they're mostly tied up, but I appreciate the question
[35:57.450 --> 36:01.930]  It was time to address that that was a little bit awkward felt a little bit weird as I was swinging them around there
[36:01.930 --> 36:05.130]  But a lot of people asked about it. So I guess it was time to show off the dreadlocks
[36:05.130 --> 36:09.530]  That's the length the texture the color the size the shape all the shit that you wanted to know
[36:09.690 --> 36:14.630]  Not shy about it can't be shy having dreadlocks for this long. You get all the questions eventually
[36:14.630 --> 36:19.690]  So I hope that wraps that up for now if anybody else out there has any I guess dreadlock questions as well
[36:19.690 --> 36:21.690]  Feel free ask away
[36:21.930 --> 36:23.930]  Yeah, that was fun
[36:24.450 --> 36:29.970]  Also while I'm thinking about it, please check out my friends at operation grow I'm part of a thing called
[36:30.570 --> 36:36.890]  Operation grow sponsored by PL grow systems is also sponsored by new millennium nutrients and autopilot systems
[36:36.890 --> 36:39.370]  And of course it is sponsored by I read genetics
[36:39.370 --> 36:45.490]  I'll tell you briefly about what operation grow is on operation grow. I was I gave
[36:45.810 --> 36:48.090]  Let me correct myself and catch up with my own thoughts
[36:48.090 --> 36:50.090]  I'm trying to read my notes and my notes threw me off
[36:50.170 --> 36:57.250]  What operation grow is I donated packs of seeds to six growers, I think six growers got the same pack of seeds
[36:57.250 --> 37:03.370]  They all got orange chasm seeds. They were all given an autopilot system. They were all given new millennium nutrients
[37:03.370 --> 37:09.090]  They're all growing on the same schedule. We are all talking about our progress and documenting our grow on
[37:09.930 --> 37:13.370]  Operation grow on YouTube. I think you can find it under operation grow
[37:14.010 --> 37:16.810]  2019 because of course it started in 2019
[37:16.810 --> 37:20.490]  We know it's 2020 now, but I had started back then
[37:20.490 --> 37:28.370]  So what I'm doing here is I am inviting you to check out the show operation grow on YouTube every Saturday
[37:29.290 --> 37:33.710]  Mountain time at 2 p.m. We go live on YouTube and we talk about the grow
[37:34.210 --> 37:40.090]  Everybody that is involved in operation grow shows their progress with the orange chasm plants. They all got seeds
[37:40.090 --> 37:43.090]  They all germinated at the same time. They're all using the autopilot
[37:43.090 --> 37:47.890]  they're all using new millennium nutrients, the only differences are the lighting and the environment and
[37:48.410 --> 37:55.690]  Some people got samples of cocoa as well. So I think everybody's using cocoa. There are very few variables in this experiment
[37:56.170 --> 38:00.530]  Everybody also has a PL grow minder unit. So we're able to see the
[38:01.050 --> 38:08.370]  The temperature their humidity the fluctuations the VPD in these rooms. We're getting pictures. We're getting a lot of documentation
[38:08.370 --> 38:10.410]  It's a really fun experiment project
[38:10.970 --> 38:17.970]  Series that is happening. You can join us. I invite you every Saturday. Like I said 2 p.m. Mountain time. I am in Colorado
[38:17.970 --> 38:19.970]  It's at 2 p.m. My time. I don't know where you are
[38:20.330 --> 38:25.130]  Use your iPhone to let you know what time you need to tune in or if you miss the live show
[38:25.130 --> 38:29.570]  It is YouTube and they are magically left up there forever. So you can go watch them on
[38:30.210 --> 38:31.650]  operation grow
[38:31.650 --> 38:32.690]  2019 all right
[38:32.690 --> 38:37.610]  I'm glad I caught that note before I wrapped up the show because I gotta give a shout out to my buddy Pete Pete
[38:37.610 --> 38:44.490]  Thank you for letting me be the breeder to donate the seeds for the operation and just for being involved. It's fun
[38:44.490 --> 38:46.810]  I'm having a good time. I'm learning about my own genetics
[38:46.810 --> 38:52.870]  I'm getting data that I never would have had access to before and in today's modern world data is everything
[38:52.870 --> 38:54.990]  And I just got to figure out what the fuck to do with the data
[38:55.570 --> 38:57.570]  Alright, so it is time to wrap up this podcast
