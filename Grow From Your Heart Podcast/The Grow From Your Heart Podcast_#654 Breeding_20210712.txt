[02:06.500 --> 02:11.860]  multi-cam experiment here i'm learning this i did realize that in the last episode uh there were a
[02:11.860 --> 02:16.260]  couple of hiccups if you will i don't know what happened dude i'm learning i'm new at this we'll
[02:16.260 --> 02:20.820]  figure it out come along for the ride with me be patient we'll get it going i still feel like i put
[02:20.820 --> 02:24.820]  out a quality episode last time none of the information really got lost there was one jump
[02:24.820 --> 02:28.580]  cut where it felt like a couple of seconds of the video may have disappeared i don't know what
[02:28.580 --> 02:32.820]  happened if you didn't notice i didn't notice it was fucking perfect bro anyway thank you for coming
[02:32.820 --> 02:37.300]  on this multi-cam journey with me we're learning together uh somebody told me a long time ago they
[02:37.300 --> 02:41.140]  were worried about all of the uh technical additions to the show they didn't want it to
[02:41.140 --> 02:46.580]  take away from the podcast i'm not going to let it take away from the main focus of the show which
[02:46.580 --> 02:51.060]  is teaching you uh sharing my knowledge with you on how to grow quality cannabis how to improve
[02:51.060 --> 02:55.540]  your garden uh today we're going to focus on breeding i got a great question about breeding
[02:55.540 --> 02:59.700]  a lot of people ask me about breeding uh it's time to talk more about it so we're going to do that in
[02:59.700 --> 03:05.780]  just a moment obviously i'm stoned and rambly today but i won't let all the new gear uh distract
[03:05.780 --> 03:10.340]  me from the focus of the show i write the show i do all the stuff on the computer on the paper i do
[03:10.340 --> 03:15.300]  all that then we play with all the gear i've just added a step i don't let it uh take from the
[03:15.300 --> 03:20.020]  previous steps i just added more to it i think it's gonna go well it's always got to keep evolving
[03:20.020 --> 03:24.820]  getting better or it will get stale got to keep moving forward you guys can't stay where we were
[03:24.820 --> 03:28.820]  right move forward do what you can do all right i should move forward and quit talking about the
[03:28.820 --> 03:35.140]  same thing this episode will come out right after 7 10 7 10 snuck up on me this year there aren't
[03:35.140 --> 03:40.900]  any major cannabis events going on in my area that i'm aware of uh no vending opportunities no
[03:40.900 --> 03:44.900]  major consumption opportunities we just came out of a really weird time here in the world
[03:44.900 --> 03:50.020]  so nobody really prepared anything for the 7 10 event there is a another non-cannabis related
[03:50.020 --> 03:54.900]  event i will be attending on 7 10 i'm probably the only dab cadet in there everybody else will
[03:54.900 --> 03:59.380]  be there for another thing uh but yeah 7 10 snuck up on me when you hear this it will be
[03:59.380 --> 04:04.180]  post 7 10 i hope everybody had a wonderful beautiful 7 10 i hope you stocked up on concentrates
[04:04.980 --> 04:09.300]  they will sell out quickly this time of year the places where you go to get your dabs may not have
[04:09.300 --> 04:14.420]  dabs because 7 10 is coming really quickly if you don't know about 7 10 we'll just ramble on to that
[04:14.420 --> 04:20.500]  one for a moment i have done a full podcast episode one year ago did a full episode about 7 10 i bust
[04:20.500 --> 04:24.660]  out a bunch of equipment i should probably do that again now that i'm doing two cameras maybe get
[04:24.660 --> 04:30.180]  another camera and do that one uh but 7 10 if you flip the number 7 10 upside down it actually says
[04:30.180 --> 04:36.260]  the word oil so 7 10 is a good time to smoke oil we take dabs now it's 7 10 a lot of people smoke
[04:36.260 --> 04:43.220]  flowers or a joint or a blunt or a bong rip at 4 20 now 7 10 is when you smoke some dabs 7 10 is
[04:43.220 --> 04:49.220]  dab culture it is the new 4 20 so that's what i'm talking about when i say 7 10 happy 7 10 everybody
[04:49.220 --> 04:53.380]  i'm sorry i didn't put out a 7 10 episode i'm sorry i missed that it snuck up on me this year
[04:53.380 --> 04:57.620]  like i said lots of stuff going on and no events so we didn't pay attention to 7 10 that light
[04:57.620 --> 05:01.380]  right there is making my eye twitch that was really awkward on camera not even going to edit
[05:01.380 --> 05:07.700]  that i hope you saw it um where do we go from here i want to give a big shout out to shikari
[05:07.700 --> 05:11.700]  richardson that's right i'm not going to delve too far into this topic this is everybody's heard
[05:11.700 --> 05:16.500]  about it every cannabis consumer has heard about what happened to uh the lovely shikari richardson
[05:16.500 --> 05:21.860]  a uh an olympic runner has been uh basically stopped from running not allowed to run in
[05:21.860 --> 05:27.460]  certain events because she failed a cannabis drug test that's right she had weed in her system
[05:28.660 --> 05:33.460]  the place where she consumed cannabis cannabis was legal at the time where she consumed it it
[05:33.460 --> 05:38.260]  was legal there she was in a place where she could smoke cannabis she also had a family member just
[05:38.260 --> 05:42.820]  passed away i believe it may have been her mom just passed away i know uh god i don't even want
[05:42.820 --> 05:46.340]  to think about that moment but i'm gonna smoke some cannabis when my mom passes i promise you
[05:46.820 --> 05:52.420]  uh but uh the person was just doing life and where they were life was happening and that was legal
[05:52.420 --> 05:56.660]  and because they're an olympic athlete because they did something that was a was legal where
[05:56.660 --> 06:02.420]  they were now they can't compete in an event um that's bullshit it's kind of shitty that somebody
[06:02.420 --> 06:07.300]  can't compete because of cannabis use also i have friends who are athletes i hang out with a couple
[06:07.300 --> 06:12.020]  yeah i'm not an athlete myself at all but i do have a diverse group of friends uh shout out to
[06:12.020 --> 06:15.540]  my friend who had a conversation with me doesn't want his name said on my show i'm sure of it
[06:15.700 --> 06:20.420]  shout out to my buddy who had a conversation with me today he is an athlete he's competed in
[06:20.420 --> 06:24.900]  major events i think he may have been in an olympic he was a wrestler the dude's a wrestler
[06:24.900 --> 06:30.580]  his brother was a ufc fighter uh they said that when you are in these types of events
[06:30.580 --> 06:34.500]  that it's not just a paper contract you don't just read paper and you sign shit and say that's
[06:34.500 --> 06:39.140]  the rules there's a meeting there is a discussion people talk to you and they put it into your head
[06:39.140 --> 06:45.380]  lots of times there is no cannabis use while you were under this contract yeah cannabis may be
[06:45.380 --> 06:50.500]  legal in colorado oregon california wherever you want to go that it's legal it may be legal there
[06:50.500 --> 06:56.340]  but if you choose to be an olympic runner you are forfeiting that this is your new thing your
[06:56.340 --> 07:00.900]  new contract this rule supersedes all of those rules you can't do it just like if you want some
[07:00.900 --> 07:05.700]  jobs you have to pass a drug test you can't do certain jobs if you want to be a cannabis consumer
[07:05.700 --> 07:11.620]  the olympics are the same way so there is kind of a being a person who wants freedom and free
[07:11.620 --> 07:15.540]  cannabis and legalize cannabis and let's all smoke and have a good time and i feel that athletes
[07:15.540 --> 07:19.380]  need cannabis just as much if not more than anybody they're struggling their bodies hurt
[07:19.380 --> 07:23.940]  they're under uh strain mentally and physically all day long they need something to calm down
[07:23.940 --> 07:28.740]  make themselves feel better i think it feels good uh when i move heavy stuff after i take a
[07:28.740 --> 07:32.820]  dab after that i don't feel like i moved a bunch of heavy stuff i think athletes should be allowed
[07:32.820 --> 07:38.340]  to consume i think everybody should be allowed to consume responsibly but she did sign a paper
[07:38.340 --> 07:43.860]  she did shake hands and say i won't do that my job depends on it so that's kind of a 50 50 i'm
[07:43.860 --> 07:48.100]  torn between that how i feel on it was her responsibility to not get caught consuming
[07:48.100 --> 07:53.620]  cannabis is what that was uh she's gonna do it don't get caught so um that was her responsibility
[07:53.620 --> 07:58.820]  but where i'm leading to that i do want to give a shout out to one of her sponsors if you know
[07:58.820 --> 08:02.100]  my personal life if you know me if you pay attention to my social media you know i'm a big
[08:02.100 --> 08:07.940]  old sneakerhead uh quarantine covid uh the lockdown got me bored i wasn't allowed to go anywhere
[08:07.940 --> 08:12.740]  usually i go to a comedy show or a concert every single weekend if not two or three of those a week
[08:12.740 --> 08:16.660]  uh during covid i wasn't going anywhere we were sitting here zooming and being on a zoom video
[08:16.660 --> 08:22.900]  was not enough for me i developed a ridiculous sneaker addiction that's right i've got a we
[08:22.900 --> 08:27.780]  won't go too far into that because it could be a problem i may need an intervention find me up on
[08:27.780 --> 08:32.740]  intervention taking away my sneakers uh but i wanted to give a shout out to nike because nike
[08:32.740 --> 08:39.540]  is shikari richardson's official sponsor and nike did not revoke their sponsorship which i
[08:39.540 --> 08:44.100]  think is kind of cool in this uh day and age i feel like such an old guy when i say that
[08:45.700 --> 08:50.420]  your sponsors bail out if you say something wrong very quickly your sponsors cancel you
[08:50.420 --> 08:55.540]  and forget about you very quickly if you make the wrong move and for nike to support uh their
[08:55.540 --> 08:59.380]  endorsee i think that's the appropriate word that just came out smoothly we're gonna go with it
[08:59.540 --> 09:04.740]  for nike to support this endorsee like that and not drop them not fire them not pull any ads not
[09:04.740 --> 09:09.300]  take any funding not take any merch deals uh that is really cool so shout out to nike for doing that
[09:09.300 --> 09:13.300]  a lot of people are gonna say you're shouting out a big ol corporation they're standing up for a
[09:13.300 --> 09:18.420]  cannabis consumer which is kind of cool and they've also been putting out some cannabis friendly uh
[09:18.420 --> 09:24.580]  shoes and merch so that's kind of cool um that's enough uh what is it pop culture current news
[09:24.580 --> 09:27.540]  current events we don't need enough of that on that we don't need much of that on this show let's
[09:27.540 --> 09:32.260]  focus on cannabis a lot of people are going to listen to this episode because this is going to be
[09:32.260 --> 09:38.740]  the episode about breeding that's right i've got an email here about breeding uh many people listen
[09:38.740 --> 09:45.860]  to the podcast they may not know that i am also the founder breeder sole proprietor uh i am the
[09:45.860 --> 09:52.500]  one man army of iree genetics iree genetics premium seeds is a seed company uh i slash we
[09:52.500 --> 09:57.140]  make regular and feminized seeds i'm sure most people that listen to the show know that but i'm
[09:57.140 --> 10:01.300]  sure there's a few people out there that have no idea that i even make seeds it's just uh something
[10:01.300 --> 10:05.380]  that may have not gotten to their radar but i make seeds i'm iree genetics premium seeds
[10:06.100 --> 10:10.500]  i'm fairly well known for my breeding technique my breeding methods my methods are tried and
[10:10.500 --> 10:14.500]  trued i've got a couple of male plants a few male plants have passed through my stable that have
[10:14.500 --> 10:20.820]  been proven to be studs i've got a very uh reliable selection of female plants um and my breeding
[10:20.820 --> 10:26.340]  skills have been proven uh and i think i'm breeding with purpose and from a good place so i feel like
[10:26.340 --> 10:30.420]  i uh can give you a good little rundown on breeding and a lot of people have been asking for
[10:30.420 --> 10:34.180]  it is where i think i was headed with that a lot of people have been asking me for breeding tips
[10:34.180 --> 10:39.060]  and i don't talk about it a lot on the show honestly because i wanted to make sure to give
[10:39.060 --> 10:43.940]  all of the basic grow tips first i mean i need you you need to be able to grow it's not you don't
[10:43.940 --> 10:47.940]  need i guess you it's better if i shouldn't say need because you can pull off seeds no matter
[10:47.940 --> 10:52.020]  what if you try uh it's better if you know how to grow if you understand the plant before you
[10:52.020 --> 10:56.340]  start breeding you shouldn't in my opinion just start breeding right away have a good relationship
[10:56.340 --> 11:00.660]  with the plant understand how it grows understand the functions of the plant then understand what
[11:00.660 --> 11:04.740]  you're looking for in breeding build it just have a good foundation so i wanted you to get that
[11:04.740 --> 11:09.940]  before i started doing too much about breeding also uh my business is breeding that's part of
[11:09.940 --> 11:13.780]  what that's how i survive so why do i want to teach everybody else how to breed but at this
[11:13.780 --> 11:17.700]  point i'm very insecure with my role in the breeding community with my role in the cannabis
[11:17.700 --> 11:21.540]  community i can teach you how to breed i'm going to do my thing forever it's not going to push me
[11:21.620 --> 11:24.740]  out of a job out of the market or anything like that so i'm willing to share my knowledge
[11:25.380 --> 11:30.020]  grow from your heart breed with love let's uh cut me off of this fucking ramble fest and let's
[11:30.020 --> 11:35.220]  actually jump into this email and we'll set up this part of the show it goes just like this it
[11:35.220 --> 11:40.260]  says rasta jeff i'm not sure if i'm submit submitting this in the proper area but i am a
[11:40.260 --> 11:46.100]  long-time listener and i grow personally for companies and for myself for over five years
[11:46.100 --> 11:49.940]  there's a lot there in that first sentence you did submit it to the appropriate channel you sent
[11:49.940 --> 11:55.300]  that to grow from your heart at hotmail.com that got right to me thank you uh long time listener
[11:55.300 --> 11:59.860]  thank you i do appreciate that long time listener first time emailer it looks like uh thanks for the
[11:59.860 --> 12:05.460]  great message because this one is a good one got me off on a good ramble uh says i grow personally
[12:05.460 --> 12:09.700]  and for companies now that's going to get my attention because this is a breeding question
[12:10.260 --> 12:17.300]  before i even get to the breeding part let me ramble about this if you work for a big company
[12:17.300 --> 12:22.580]  that has plants that are in flower and you are breeding at home it is your responsibility as the
[12:22.580 --> 12:28.260]  grower slash breeder slash person with all the plans to not pollinate that commercial grow if
[12:28.260 --> 12:33.780]  you grow at work that's a commercial grow do not contaminate that grow with pollen they are relying
[12:33.780 --> 12:39.300]  on that crop to pay your bills your rent comes from that crop the patients the customers the
[12:39.300 --> 12:45.620]  consumers don't want that crop seeded because you decided to be a a new breeder a pollen chucker at
[12:45.620 --> 12:51.380]  home if you successfully breed some seeds without contaminating that crop at work we'll call you a
[12:51.380 --> 12:56.260]  breeder if you fuck up and pollinate that entire crop at work you're a shitty pollen chucker and
[12:56.260 --> 13:00.820]  you didn't do your job right so the first thing you need to do is make sure in my opinion the
[13:00.820 --> 13:06.500]  first thing you should do maybe need to do i try not to use words like should and need but
[13:06.500 --> 13:11.860]  uh this i feel like it's appropriate you you need to make sure uh you should make sure not to
[13:11.860 --> 13:16.820]  pollinate that big commercial grow people are relying on that to be seedless top shelf quality
[13:16.820 --> 13:21.860]  bud don't seed that shit up so now once you're sure you're not going to seed up that grow then
[13:21.860 --> 13:25.780]  we can talk more about breeding uh there are several ways to make sure you don't seed that
[13:25.780 --> 13:30.820]  grow up change your clothes a lot wash your hair water deactivates pollen anytime you're around that
[13:30.820 --> 13:35.300]  male plant when he's pollinating just scorch yourself down with pollen change your clothes
[13:35.300 --> 13:41.060]  have clothes that you go in the grow room with and your personal grow then grow clothes that you don't
[13:41.060 --> 13:45.620]  wear in the grow so you come out of the grow you change clothes possibly take a shower between those
[13:45.620 --> 13:50.420]  clothes if you have time if it's possible come out of the grow change clothes put on fresh clothes
[13:50.420 --> 13:55.620]  then go to work and put on different clothes at that grow so you're using different clothes in
[13:55.620 --> 14:00.420]  that grow different clothes at home and different clothes in your home grow it sounds tedious it
[14:00.420 --> 14:05.940]  sounds ridiculous but with the experiments you're trying to play with and the money you're putting
[14:05.940 --> 14:11.540]  at risk at that commercial grow it is what is necessary everything from the hat to the shoes
[14:11.540 --> 14:17.300]  need to be different don't take those same shoes in your grow that you do to the commercial grow
[14:17.940 --> 14:21.620]  that should be the rule of thumb anyway you don't want to move those bugs around and if you're
[14:21.620 --> 14:25.940]  getting in the car you're leaving work getting in the car those bugs are riding home with you
[14:25.940 --> 14:29.860]  you're bringing them into the house you should change clothes take a shower at that point then
[14:29.860 --> 14:35.220]  go into your grow in different clothes it's really hard to keep it all separate but do the best that
[14:35.220 --> 14:41.460]  you can keep that pollen away from the other grow really don't fuck up that grow so i want to
[14:41.460 --> 14:46.020]  finish this message but that really stands out when you say i want to breed at home and i'm working
[14:46.020 --> 14:50.420]  at a company that's going to set off a lot of alarms for a lot of people don't tell anybody at
[14:50.420 --> 14:56.260]  the commercial grow that you're breeding at home because if one seed pops up they're all going to
[14:56.260 --> 14:59.620]  blame you they're gonna be like it's that pollen chucker that's breeding at home he just seeded
[14:59.620 --> 15:04.260]  everything it's all going to be your fault all right there is more of this message it says now
[15:04.260 --> 15:09.540]  i'm deciding i want to try out breeding at a personal level at home is there a previous episode
[15:09.540 --> 15:13.780]  number you can point me to for the best breeding guide i've actually listened to two episodes about
[15:13.780 --> 15:20.100]  breeding terms but i'm curious if you have a more of a guide formatted episode already thanks again
[15:20.100 --> 15:25.460]  for everything much love uh do they say their name they don't say that they want their name
[15:25.460 --> 15:30.740]  said so they know who they are they don't need their name said on this episode but they've got
[15:30.740 --> 15:35.300]  a great question let's talk a little bit about breeding i do not have a previous episode where i
[15:35.300 --> 15:40.180]  talk specifically about breeding i do talk about uh pollination times i've talked a couple of times
[15:40.180 --> 15:45.620]  about male selection which i'll touch on here but i don't think i've done the episode that i owe you
[15:45.620 --> 15:49.780]  for good breeding so i'm gonna take a sip of my drink here because i'm sure you could hear it in
[15:49.780 --> 15:54.580]  my throat after i get a little moisture on the face here we will talk about breeding hang out
[15:54.580 --> 15:58.580]  here we go let's talk about breeding cannabis uh the main thing one of the main things to think
[15:58.580 --> 16:03.860]  about is if you're gonna breed do you want to pollinate all of the plants or just a couple of
[16:03.860 --> 16:08.740]  plants because uh pollen is hard to control if you don't have some experience and a plan there
[16:08.740 --> 16:13.380]  are ways to control the pollen but if you're new if you don't have some some strategy in place you
[16:13.380 --> 16:19.140]  could really mess up like i mentioned earlier do not pollinate your work grow do not pollinate your
[16:19.140 --> 16:23.940]  friends grow do not pollinate the grow down the street think about that sort of stuff be kind to
[16:23.940 --> 16:28.820]  the people around you a lot of people are growing cannabis now and a lot of people are relying on
[16:28.820 --> 16:33.460]  that for medicine a lot of people are also growing hemp all over the place you've got to worry about
[16:33.460 --> 16:39.380]  getting pollinated as well uh from other sources so i would recommend only breeding indoors or in
[16:39.380 --> 16:44.260]  a greenhouse of some sort i don't really trust outdoor breeding because if some guy down the
[16:44.260 --> 16:49.140]  street gets a male he may breed with me on accident breed with my plants on accident
[16:49.140 --> 16:54.980]  sounds better that way okay one of the main things to think about when breeding is what is
[16:54.980 --> 16:58.980]  your goal do you have a goal or are you just pollen chucking if you're just pollen chucking
[16:58.980 --> 17:04.900]  that is fun too but it's much better much more fulfilling uh much more rewarding and uh much more
[17:04.900 --> 17:09.220]  successful if you have a goal how do you even know if you were successful if you didn't have a goal
[17:09.220 --> 17:13.700]  if you're just putting plant a and plant b in a room together and putting pollen on the plants and
[17:13.700 --> 17:18.980]  letting it happen and then growing the seeds that's fun but it was their success in it what was your
[17:18.980 --> 17:25.780]  goal did you have something in mind did you want to do something are you making seeds for do you
[17:25.780 --> 17:30.980]  intend to eventually be a commercial seed producer will these seeds be put to market are you going to
[17:30.980 --> 17:34.420]  make seeds to give to your friends are you going to sell them you're going to pass them out at
[17:34.420 --> 17:39.300]  trade shows are they going to be gifts are they are they something you intend on making to give to
[17:39.300 --> 17:45.220]  disabled veterans who can't afford seeds or um i don't know there's some random group i was trying
[17:45.220 --> 17:49.460]  to think of some random group with like a bunch of random names but then it almost got offensive
[17:49.460 --> 17:54.420]  in my head like um just random people from a random place that do random things that enjoy
[17:54.420 --> 17:58.820]  a certain thing all those together in one group are you specifically finding seeds for those people
[17:58.820 --> 18:02.580]  who can't afford them uh whatever you're doing with the seeds what is your goal or are you just
[18:02.580 --> 18:06.180]  going to grow them at your house on your own or in your commercial grow on your own what's your
[18:06.180 --> 18:12.020]  goal for the seeds think about what your goal is it's all about a goal a lot of things in
[18:12.740 --> 18:17.620]  productivity of any sort it's all about your goal you can't get to the destination to the end
[18:17.620 --> 18:21.860]  without a good goal from the very beginning so when we're breeding when we're making seeds
[18:21.860 --> 18:27.060]  let's have a goal one of the first goals to think of is what am i breeding for who are these seeds
[18:27.060 --> 18:31.380]  going to how big is this going to get so think about that from the beginning and kind of be
[18:31.380 --> 18:38.820]  prepared for that from the start then your next goal is to improve upon the cannabis species not
[18:38.820 --> 18:43.300]  just to make this strain in this strain because you want to name it the two strains together would
[18:43.300 --> 18:47.620]  make a really clever name and you want to make a million dollars off a cool strain name the cool
[18:47.620 --> 18:52.180]  strain name will get you so far but once people grow those seeds and realize that they suck because
[18:52.180 --> 18:56.900]  you didn't do any proper selection then that strain sucks and now you got a really popular
[18:56.900 --> 19:01.620]  strain name that is known for putting out shitty plants so that that's not the way to do it have a
[19:02.020 --> 19:08.820]  improve upon the species maybe you've got something that tastes really good but it
[19:08.820 --> 19:13.220]  lacks potency maybe you've got something that is super potent that doesn't taste good maybe you
[19:13.220 --> 19:18.180]  want to improve upon that thing somehow then you need to find a probably guess you're gonna have a
[19:18.180 --> 19:22.900]  female if you're smoking it then you need to find a male that is going to improve upon that female
[19:22.900 --> 19:27.860]  when they breed if you breed them together and you just make something that is worse or not better
[19:27.860 --> 19:32.420]  than both of the plants you started with you didn't really breed successfully in my opinion
[19:32.420 --> 19:38.260]  unless your goal was to isolate one trait if you don't care about the potency and the way that it
[19:38.260 --> 19:42.980]  grows you're just looking for straight up that one sour mango terp and that's all you're breeding for
[19:42.980 --> 19:49.940]  you can do that but i want potency vigor uh things that people often forget about is uh stuff like
[19:49.940 --> 19:55.380]  pest resistance pathogen resistance cold resistance drought resistance how does it handle
[19:55.380 --> 20:01.700]  temperature swings diurnal swings humidity swings does it take stress well because i put a lot of my
[20:01.700 --> 20:07.060]  plants in a commercial grow and uh no disrespect to the ladies and gentlemen at the commercial grow
[20:07.060 --> 20:10.820]  but sometimes they're overworked and they're stressed and they party too hard on the weekend
[20:10.820 --> 20:15.300]  or whatever is going on and the plants have a little uh they don't get taken care of as much
[20:15.300 --> 20:19.380]  as they could have maybe saturday and sunday the weekend crew might be hung over or whatever and
[20:19.380 --> 20:24.420]  the plants deal with some stress i need them to survive that stress in the commercial grow also
[20:24.420 --> 20:29.460]  i sell seeds commercially people that have never grown before are getting my seeds i want them to
[20:29.460 --> 20:34.180]  have great success and they're going to beat these plants up so it's all about selection we need
[20:34.180 --> 20:41.780]  plants that are going to survive drought stress problems uh being popped and twisted and manipulated
[20:41.780 --> 20:45.700]  a lot of these things are going to be delivered by the male plant a lot of these traits come from
[20:45.700 --> 20:52.900]  the male side of this equation and a lot of people are only breeding for flavor aroma uh we call we
[20:52.900 --> 20:57.540]  call it in the industry instagram ability can you post this plant like is it going to look good is
[20:57.540 --> 21:01.700]  it going to sell through instagram but then when you get it in your garden like i said a minute ago
[21:01.700 --> 21:06.900]  you grow it and it just grows like shit it grows real skinny and it falls over and one of the buds
[21:06.900 --> 21:11.140]  at the top is beautiful it's fucking purple it's got red leaves coming off of it instagram goes
[21:11.140 --> 21:16.660]  ape shit but it doesn't grow worth a shit and when you smoke it the buzz is miserable and there's no
[21:16.660 --> 21:21.220]  good flavor to it it just looks really good it hit a good lab test because it's got a lot of trichomes
[21:21.220 --> 21:26.660]  on it but there's nothing good about it other than paper and instagram so breed for the right
[21:26.660 --> 21:31.700]  stuff have a goal improve upon the plant and don't just be pollen chucking and they're just a pollen
[21:31.700 --> 21:38.260]  chuck so uh selection is key i talked about a lot of the resistance pet uh pest and pathogen we're
[21:38.260 --> 21:44.100]  just going to call that pet that's my new word right now uh pest and pathogen resistance comes
[21:44.100 --> 21:50.020]  from the male a lot of that comes from the male so a good male is key to a good breeding project
[21:50.020 --> 21:56.260]  male selection is very important i've done full episodes on male selection but selecting the male
[21:56.260 --> 22:02.340]  um let's talk about choosing a male it's all about your goal do you want to make uh indica or sativa
[22:02.340 --> 22:06.500]  dominant plants do you want to make tall skinny plants do you want to make short squatty plants
[22:06.500 --> 22:11.460]  do you want to make plants that flower in 50 days do you want to make plants that flower in 70 days
[22:11.460 --> 22:17.300]  do you want to make plants that flower in 142 days shout out to my buddy lemur priest for his 140 day
[22:17.300 --> 22:25.220]  finishers um what do you want to make you've got to choose a male that will contribute those traits
[22:25.220 --> 22:30.020]  to the mix of course he's only going to give 50 maybe that's something else we're going to talk
[22:30.020 --> 22:35.540]  about in a moment uh he's only going to give about 50 of his traits to this cross what is he shaped
[22:35.540 --> 22:40.980]  like what does he smell like find a male that has traits that you want to work with this is kind of
[22:40.980 --> 22:46.500]  like chefing uh this male is one of your ingredients but we've only got two ingredients to work with
[22:46.500 --> 22:51.460]  so what does this male bring to the table are we mixing uh what are two flavors that are good
[22:51.460 --> 22:57.140]  together um chocolate and anything right chocolate and strawberries would be good together um what
[22:57.140 --> 23:01.940]  else is good together i'm just trying to think of random shit now but like savory stuff together is
[23:01.940 --> 23:05.860]  always good but then if you go and mix two of the wrong things together sometimes it just doesn't
[23:05.860 --> 23:10.260]  fucking taste good that's how breeding is also uh you got to have the right two ingredients if you
[23:10.260 --> 23:14.820]  mix the two bad ingredients together it's just not gonna work you can't put ketchup and milk in the
[23:14.820 --> 23:22.100]  same bottle and expect that to be good sometimes breeding goes that way so find a male with the
[23:22.100 --> 23:28.580]  features that you're looking for shape structure leaf size leaf shape colors does that male plant
[23:28.580 --> 23:33.780]  put out colors are you looking for a plant that turns dark colors red colors purple colors look
[23:33.780 --> 23:40.020]  for a male plant that exhibits those traits in the leaves uh flowering time we don't want i
[23:40.020 --> 23:45.460]  personally don't want a male that takes way too long to flower but i also don't want a male that
[23:45.460 --> 23:50.340]  shows me flower too early um something i mentioned this is a good segue into that
[23:51.540 --> 23:59.860]  if a male plant flowers too early in my opinion he contributes too much of himself to the breeding
[23:59.860 --> 24:05.780]  mix my goal in breeding most of the time is to find a male and a female that when they breed
[24:05.780 --> 24:11.620]  together you can find a perfect balance of the male and female in the offspring you'll see
[24:11.620 --> 24:16.340]  offspring that look just like mommy just like daddy and then you'll see some that you'll say
[24:16.340 --> 24:20.900]  man i see mommy's growth structure in there it smells just like daddy it does that stretching
[24:20.900 --> 24:26.100]  thing that mommy does it does the leaf shape of the daddy plant that is my goal is to find a male
[24:26.100 --> 24:31.700]  that doesn't overpower the female but still puts enough of itself into that cross to make the
[24:31.700 --> 24:37.460]  females different and the off to make the offspring different and something new so i don't
[24:37.460 --> 24:43.140]  want a male plant that flowers right away if i have uh if i get a 10 pack most people buy a 10
[24:43.140 --> 24:47.620]  pack of seeds if you got 10 seeds you're most likely going to find somewhere between four and
[24:47.620 --> 24:52.340]  six males in there for the sake of my story we're going to say you got five male plants the girls
[24:52.340 --> 24:57.540]  are doing their thing we're going to talk about the boys that first male plant to flower is way
[24:57.540 --> 25:02.740]  too eager he's like i want to flower here we go i don't want to breed with him i think the
[25:02.740 --> 25:08.020]  offspring he makes is going to be mostly like him it's going to be shaped like him it's going to
[25:08.020 --> 25:12.740]  have the leaf structure uh the build and it's going to flower too quickly if that plant gets
[25:12.740 --> 25:18.500]  root bound if that plant doesn't get enough light it's got a uh what's the word propensity um wow
[25:18.500 --> 25:22.340]  big words for me today i'm not even sure if that's the right fucking word but we're going with it
[25:22.660 --> 25:28.340]  it could flower early because that male plant that i used was an early flowering plant if i've got
[25:28.340 --> 25:35.140]  five i generally choose the third or fourth male to go into flower and start showing me hey i'm a
[25:35.140 --> 25:39.460]  strong male flowering plant i want to see big stamens coming off of it i want to see rapid
[25:39.460 --> 25:44.820]  growth into flower that fourth or fifth one will be the winner sometimes that's not the third or
[25:44.820 --> 25:50.260]  fourth will probably be the keeper uh that is not hard and fast but that is kind of a rule of thumb
[25:50.260 --> 25:56.660]  and i i kind of have an eye when i'm popping seeds i can see early early on early in veg like
[25:56.660 --> 26:01.380]  when they go from their small like the cup or their small veg into their large veg pots i have
[26:01.380 --> 26:06.260]  usually already decided that right there is my breeding male these two over here are the keeper
[26:06.260 --> 26:13.380]  females i try not to let my uh my intuition like that ruin anything i try to still be open-minded
[26:13.380 --> 26:18.580]  but most of the time i'm correct already at that point and by the time it's dried and cured and
[26:18.580 --> 26:22.660]  smoked everybody else already agrees like you were right bro we saw it from the beginning because
[26:22.660 --> 26:28.580]  they've been around so much we just train them and i share my ideas but um i kind of got myself
[26:28.580 --> 26:33.620]  lost there on a ramble but i enjoy that find a good male plant uh that third or fourth one is
[26:33.620 --> 26:37.780]  going to be your good male plant uh the early ones are going to put too much of themselves into the
[26:37.780 --> 26:42.500]  mix that third or fourth one is going to be a good breeder it's going to have uh it's going to pass
[26:42.500 --> 26:47.380]  enough of itself onto the female to show you what it's got to offer and then the female is going to
[26:47.380 --> 26:51.460]  be able to express itself in the breeding project and like i said a moment ago that's when you get
[26:51.460 --> 26:56.340]  the offspring that shows uh phenotypes that look like mommy phenotypes that look like daddy and
[26:56.340 --> 27:00.740]  then phenotypes that you could see that perfect chocolate strawberry mix half of it is chocolate
[27:00.740 --> 27:05.140]  half of it is strawberry it's perfectly beautiful you can see that happen if your selections are
[27:05.140 --> 27:10.260]  proper if that is your goal also maybe that's not your goal maybe you want to just recreate this
[27:10.260 --> 27:14.900]  female plant you got to find something that doesn't adulterate it too much but most of the time the
[27:14.900 --> 27:20.020]  goal is to make a cross of those two uh that is improving the species in my opinion you don't
[27:20.020 --> 27:24.500]  want to just make a photocopy or you don't want to move backwards unless you've got a specific goal
[27:25.220 --> 27:31.380]  so good male is key maybe a male that displays trichomes if your male plant is showing trichomes
[27:31.380 --> 27:35.700]  that is a good thing we want plants that make trichomes if the males and females both make
[27:35.700 --> 27:40.580]  trichomes that should add up to shebang double trichomes right if you got a mendel chart and
[27:40.580 --> 27:44.420]  you see trichomes trichomes that's going to be fucking trichomes with a capital t right there
[27:44.420 --> 27:50.340]  on your chart baby aromas i like a male plant you're gonna think i'm crazy i say this a lot i
[27:50.340 --> 27:56.660]  say this often and i mean it i do a stem rub on the plants uh early flower i can already tell
[27:56.660 --> 28:00.420]  uh about week two week three of flower what these plants are gonna start smelling like for me
[28:00.420 --> 28:05.380]  i just grab the stem and just rub it with my fingers and smell it and if it smells like
[28:06.020 --> 28:13.220]  vomit and trash can and acrid disgustingness maybe some funky feet maybe some rotten socks
[28:13.220 --> 28:16.980]  that is a plant that i want to breed with i don't choose to breed with the sweet candy
[28:17.540 --> 28:23.140]  smelling male males because i've got those females i like an acrid funky male plant that's just
[28:23.140 --> 28:27.620]  gross i also like a plant with a good structure that's really important to me it's got to grow
[28:27.620 --> 28:33.860]  with a good structure it's got to take some abuse i will put uh just like most people do a pheno hunt
[28:33.860 --> 28:37.300]  i don't know how long it's been since i've talked about a proper pheno hunt we'll talk about that
[28:37.300 --> 28:42.180]  that's when you grow a number of seeds and you find the winners out of that pack of seeds you
[28:42.180 --> 28:47.620]  are hunting for the phenotype that you select i will do a pheno hunt for boy plants i'll grow
[28:48.420 --> 28:54.420]  it's colorado so i'll grow 12 seeds at a time and i'll find uh the females out of there and just
[28:54.420 --> 28:59.860]  toss them immediately and now i've got six or five male plants to work with and i'll watch them grow
[28:59.860 --> 29:04.660]  and i'll find the best boy out of there and i'll pull him aside and then now i've got one plant
[29:04.660 --> 29:09.540]  so now i've got 11 more seeds that i can crack and i'll run 11 and i'll find another boy in there
[29:09.540 --> 29:14.020]  and compare it to that first one and i've done that a couple times until i found stellar males
[29:14.020 --> 29:18.820]  so run a pheno hunt until you find the male plant that you want if you've only got 10 seeds there's
[29:18.820 --> 29:23.300]  a male in there that will work for you if you've got a hundred seeds your opportunity to find a
[29:23.300 --> 29:30.180]  stellar male are much better how do you know when you found a good male the only way to audition
[29:30.180 --> 29:35.780]  your stud plant is to pollinate in my opinion multiple female plants with that plant you could
[29:35.780 --> 29:40.100]  pollinate one plant with it and see what it makes maybe you just made one really awesome cross that's
[29:40.100 --> 29:46.180]  fun if that's what you want to do but if you really want to tell if that male is a good breeder hit him
[29:46.180 --> 29:51.780]  to several female plants with different traits all of those plants need to have different different
[29:51.780 --> 29:57.220]  traits i've got a strawberry starburst that smells like strawberry bubble gum or it's a strawberry
[29:57.220 --> 30:01.860]  fields from crockett smells like strawberry bubble gum i've got a platinum tangy from garden of
[30:01.860 --> 30:08.340]  whedon it smells straight up like oranges so if i hit my male plant to the strawberry and my male
[30:08.340 --> 30:14.020]  plant to the tangy i can tell i get this strawberry and something and oranges and something and i can
[30:14.020 --> 30:18.820]  tell what this male plant is bringing to the mix i can see that when i cross it to this one and to
[30:18.820 --> 30:24.580]  this one that all of the offspring got tall and made big purple leaves or i can see commonalities
[30:24.580 --> 30:30.260]  or outliers through the breeding by doing multiple female plants i can if i hit four or five different
[30:30.260 --> 30:35.380]  females i could tell what that male is going to offer if i just hit one i don't know sometimes
[30:35.380 --> 30:41.460]  if the things that come from that offspring were traits from the grandparents they could have been
[30:41.460 --> 30:46.500]  so if i use um i'm just going to say plant a and plant b it's going to be easier that way if i use
[30:46.500 --> 30:51.780]  plant a and plant b and i make offspring and i name that number one and number one shows me
[30:51.780 --> 30:57.300]  things that aren't displayed in plant a and plant b it could come from the grand the parents of plant
[30:57.300 --> 31:01.620]  a or plant b plant a's parents or plant b's parents and i wouldn't know that if i don't know
[31:01.620 --> 31:08.180]  that plant's parents so if i use multiple females i know if i'm seeing recessive traits or traits
[31:08.180 --> 31:12.660]  from grandparents or traits from great-grandparents or if i'm seeing stuff that is displayed from the
[31:12.660 --> 31:19.060]  male people wonder why seeds are so expensive you guys uh to do it properly to do it correctly to
[31:19.060 --> 31:23.860]  do it sustainably uh to do it to where you're around for a while it does take some work some
[31:23.860 --> 31:29.460]  research some effort uh some care uh some effort that's a lot of it is effort a lot of people just
[31:29.460 --> 31:32.580]  think they're going to put two plants in a room and let them hump and make some seeds and make
[31:32.580 --> 31:37.220]  some money that will work a couple of times but then people are going to buy those seeds and
[31:37.220 --> 31:40.580]  they're going to grow them out and they're going to go yeah these are not what i was hoping for
[31:40.580 --> 31:44.180]  we're going to go find a breeder that's been doing some testing and read some books and figured it
[31:44.180 --> 31:51.620]  out so um find a good selection pollinate several females with different traits um know your goal
[31:51.620 --> 31:54.500]  when you're doing this the first time you're doing it you're kind of looking to see what the
[31:54.500 --> 31:58.500]  male plant does but you've probably got some plants you've been working with for a while
[31:59.060 --> 32:05.540]  uh find a male plant that is different than the girls if you've got a bunch of crazy sativa females
[32:05.540 --> 32:10.340]  maybe find an indica heavy male or something unless you're looking to make even more sativa
[32:10.340 --> 32:15.540]  heavy females find something that is going to reach your goal but it's more fun when the male
[32:15.540 --> 32:21.060]  is different than the female so that you can see what the male is doing to that mix i keep saying
[32:21.060 --> 32:25.940]  stuff like that but once you get there and you have the seeds and you start growing and you see
[32:25.940 --> 32:31.220]  what you've created if it all looks the same you're going to go my male plant is really dominating
[32:31.220 --> 32:36.020]  the mix here because all of these crosses all smell like foot and i don't get any strawberries
[32:36.020 --> 32:39.860]  i don't get any oranges i don't get any blueberries like i expected from the females i'm just getting
[32:39.860 --> 32:44.740]  that bar trash can and puke from the male plant you know he's too powerful got to choose a
[32:44.740 --> 32:49.620]  different male for that uh that's never a bad thing this isn't on the notes yet but we're
[32:49.620 --> 32:55.700]  going to go into this part as a responsible breeder something you've got to do is know when
[32:55.700 --> 33:00.180]  you've made some trash if you've just made a bunch of seeds and you grew out a bunch of them and
[33:00.180 --> 33:04.820]  they are not impressing you they aren't better than the parent plant that you started with
[33:05.460 --> 33:10.900]  don't sell them don't pass them out don't try to recoup your losses this was a breeding project
[33:10.900 --> 33:15.460]  where you learned these plants don't breed well together you've got to get rid of that
[33:15.460 --> 33:21.380]  or just grow it yourself or maybe f2 it or b c or b exit whichever one you want to use
[33:21.380 --> 33:27.220]  shout out to my buddy f1p um work with it yourself those are yours but maybe if they're not stellar
[33:27.220 --> 33:32.260]  if they're not impressive don't put them out don't sell them that's when you go making a bad name for
[33:32.260 --> 33:37.060]  yourself if you want to be around to be in the industry for a while do things correctly be honest
[33:37.060 --> 33:42.420]  impress us with your products the internet is here forever all of the shit you do and say now
[33:42.420 --> 33:47.700]  is recorded documented programmed written down digitally stored backed up on a hard drive
[33:47.700 --> 33:52.900]  fucking stored in a cloud ready to be used against you in the court of law the court of the internet
[33:52.900 --> 33:58.260]  facebook court instagram court whatever the fuck court it is time for somebody is ready to blast
[33:58.260 --> 34:03.380]  your shit so do things correctly if you want to stick around in this industry in this scene right
[34:03.380 --> 34:08.820]  now if you're a seed breeder if you're a creator of some sort in this industry you are a pioneer
[34:08.820 --> 34:13.300]  you can either be remembered for years to come as a pioneer in this industry or you can be one
[34:13.300 --> 34:17.940]  of those people that popped up made a couple of bucks we realized you're just trying to fuck us
[34:17.940 --> 34:21.780]  for a couple of bucks and now you are gone are you here forever are you part of the industry
[34:21.780 --> 34:25.620]  are you here for the cash grab now's the time to make a decision if you're trying to get into
[34:25.620 --> 34:32.260]  the seed breeding game for the market all right that was my weird rant for this episode um yeah
[34:32.260 --> 34:36.020]  if you didn't make something good don't share it that is your responsibility to make that decision
[34:36.020 --> 34:39.940]  so pollinate a bunch of females grow that shit out multiple females are going to show you what
[34:39.940 --> 34:45.860]  the male does to the mix see what he does is this male plant adding value is he adding value to the
[34:45.860 --> 34:51.060]  crosses or is he just making a bunch of reproductions of the females or a bunch of reproductions of
[34:51.060 --> 34:56.100]  himself or is he making hemp if hemp is your goal you're reaching your goal but if that's not your
[34:56.100 --> 35:00.980]  goal we've got to figure out what male which male plant we can use in the future to reach your goal
[35:00.980 --> 35:05.620]  crack more seeds find a better male repeat the process this is why seeds get expensive i have
[35:05.620 --> 35:11.460]  thrown away male plants i've thrown away batches of seeds for every cross i for every 10 crosses
[35:11.460 --> 35:16.100]  that i released there are probably five to ten more that didn't even make it uh it's not that
[35:16.100 --> 35:21.460]  they were terrible but i only want to put out nines and tens and elevens there's a lot of people
[35:21.460 --> 35:26.660]  out there that are okay with putting out fours and sixes and that's cool but i that's just not
[35:26.660 --> 35:31.780]  how i operate i'd rather put out nines and tens and elevens because i've got the opportunity i
[35:31.780 --> 35:38.420]  know i can do it why waste your time and my time with a six if you're a six i still love you um
[35:39.060 --> 35:44.260]  where are we in this podcast i'm having fun today shout out to dabs by the way happy 710 everybody
[35:44.260 --> 35:49.700]  i hope you guys have a had a wonderful 710 is that male plant adding value i hear oh it's the
[35:49.700 --> 35:52.500]  phone giving me interference i hope you guys didn't hear that come through the microphone
[35:52.500 --> 35:56.500]  something just rattled like chewbacca in my headphones i was the phone doing interference
[35:56.500 --> 36:01.300]  with the gear here enough rambles is that male plant adding value to your cross is he doing good
[36:01.300 --> 36:06.820]  or is he just making more hemp seed for you more bird seed don't be afraid to throw away a breeding
[36:06.820 --> 36:11.700]  project go back start over do it all over again that's how you learn the most it's going to take
[36:11.700 --> 36:17.540]  a long time uh this isn't your last breeding project hopefully i say a lot of times when
[36:17.540 --> 36:21.220]  people are freaking out stressing out over their grow they're not sure what to do i just say
[36:21.220 --> 36:25.060]  it's not your last grow it's your first grow it's the first time you're doing this we're going to
[36:25.060 --> 36:29.700]  have so many more grows to figure all this stuff out go ahead and ruin the first one mess it up
[36:29.700 --> 36:33.460]  that way your fifth and sixth one can be perfect if you fuck up the fifth one i'm going to be mad
[36:33.460 --> 36:37.620]  at you if you get the first one wrong that's perfect screw up the first time screw up the
[36:37.620 --> 36:42.660]  third time screw up the fourth time fifth and six let's start getting shit correctly so all you got
[36:42.660 --> 36:47.780]  to do is start over breed again i know wasted some time wasted some energy it was worth it it's a good
[36:47.780 --> 36:52.100]  learning experience it doesn't really take that much time that long that much space uh this isn't
[36:52.100 --> 36:57.140]  on my notes but let's ramble a lot of people think that breeding requires a lot of space it doesn't
[36:57.140 --> 37:02.660]  it requires very little space you can breed with very small plants honestly when i'm making a new
[37:02.660 --> 37:07.140]  cross if it's something that has never been made before and i think that plant and that plant right
[37:07.140 --> 37:10.180]  there i should put them on a date i should put them in a room and i should let them do they
[37:10.180 --> 37:16.020]  thang and then we'll have some seeds those plants grow in a six inch net pot and they're about eight
[37:16.020 --> 37:21.860]  inches tall maybe 10 inches tall when i flower them i do not top them i grow them they get eight
[37:21.860 --> 37:27.780]  to ten inches tall they go into flower i pollinate them and then we get about somewhere between 30
[37:27.780 --> 37:32.980]  and 100 seeds depending on the plant some plants uh take pollen really well and give you a lot of
[37:32.980 --> 37:38.180]  seeds uh some are kind of stingy but some of them will just throw out seeds either way i've got
[37:38.180 --> 37:42.660]  enough to play with i can grow a few of them i can send a few of them to my tester friends they can
[37:42.660 --> 37:46.980]  grow them out then we can see if that new cross is worth the shit instead of making thousands and
[37:46.980 --> 37:52.100]  thousands of seeds out of big old plants and wasting space i can put uh we're in colorado the
[37:52.100 --> 37:57.460]  legal number to grow here is 12 plants i've got six recreationally six on my medical allowance
[37:57.460 --> 38:03.140]  so that gives me 12 plants i'll put six uh 12 let me do math in my head again i'll put 11 that's the
[38:03.140 --> 38:08.500]  goal number here 11 female plants in a room and one male plant in a room and they'll just pollinate
[38:08.500 --> 38:14.420]  all 11 of those little tiny six inch net pots under one led light real small plants real small
[38:14.420 --> 38:20.980]  pots uh grow them up just a couple of weeks flower them out pollinate them and then uh i do the 18-6
[38:20.980 --> 38:25.140]  trick once i get them good and pollinated i put the lights back on 18-6 and i actually move
[38:25.140 --> 38:29.620]  those little tiny plants back to my veg space they don't even waste any space now they're just in the
[38:29.620 --> 38:34.660]  corner of the veg space they're getting what they need they're on 18-6 they're gonna finish flowering
[38:34.660 --> 38:39.700]  in about six to eight maybe nine weeks hopefully not that long depending on the strain i will have
[38:39.700 --> 38:44.740]  somewhere between 30 and a thousand seeds from each plant to play with uh did i say a thousand
[38:44.740 --> 38:49.940]  30 and a hundred seeds from each plant to play with and that's enough for myself and lemur and
[38:49.940 --> 38:55.300]  mobius and rosin man and uh zozo to run them and see what we've got and then if i find out they're
[38:55.300 --> 38:59.380]  all good or if i find out they're all terrible we move forward from there if they're good i've still
[38:59.380 --> 39:03.780]  got the clones of the original plants make a bunch more uh this time we'll run it in a seven gallon
[39:03.780 --> 39:08.100]  pot grow it up a little bit bigger pollinate it make enough seeds to last for a minute so we could
[39:08.100 --> 39:14.260]  stock up all the vendors but you don't need a lot of space um you need the same things that you need
[39:15.140 --> 39:19.300]  for your regular grow you need a dark space that you can control the dark on i like to throw them
[39:19.300 --> 39:25.460]  into either 11 13 or 12 12 for a few weeks get them into flower get that pollen on there um so
[39:25.460 --> 39:31.860]  let's talk about this a little bit more specific detail get them into flower around day 23 to 32
[39:31.860 --> 39:38.260]  depending on the plant is when they want pollen if you pollinate early your seeds will be um they're
[39:38.260 --> 39:42.900]  more likely to be more uniform and healthier if you pollen right pollinate right in the middle
[39:42.900 --> 39:47.220]  you will get more seeds and they'll still be healthy they'll still be uniform if you pollinate
[39:47.220 --> 39:53.220]  too late your seeds will start to get uh not as round you'll get more twins you'll get more
[39:53.220 --> 39:58.180]  weirdos if you pollinate too late so it's all about timing that plant some of my plants want
[39:58.180 --> 40:03.140]  pollen i've talked about this uh the platinum tangy is ready for pollen at like day 23 of flower
[40:03.140 --> 40:08.260]  she's like pollinate me i'm ready to go strawberry fields i gotta wait till like day 27 or day 30 to
[40:08.260 --> 40:12.820]  give her pollen if i hit her too early she doesn't make enough seeds if i hit her too late she doesn't
[40:12.820 --> 40:18.660]  make good seeds so it's all about timing when it comes to breeding you may need to learn to put
[40:18.660 --> 40:24.260]  uh strawberry starburst or strawberry fields into the room a week ahead maybe two weeks ahead then
[40:24.260 --> 40:30.020]  drag the platinum tangy in there two weeks later let those flower then drag the male the male should
[40:30.020 --> 40:34.980]  already be in there so we'll talk about male timing but you want to pollinate the plants around day
[40:34.980 --> 40:41.540]  23 to 27 maybe 32 depending on the plant you want those pistols to be big and bushy and strong
[40:41.540 --> 40:46.180]  looking now let's talk about timing the male plant your male plant's probably going to start dropping
[40:46.180 --> 40:53.300]  pollen around day 14 really get going around 17 really dumping by 23 kicking it out by day 26
[40:54.260 --> 40:59.780]  your plants are ready for pollen by now but uh you may want to get the females a little bit ahead
[40:59.780 --> 41:03.620]  you may want to get the male a little bit ahead it depends on your strategy what you want to do
[41:03.620 --> 41:09.060]  i've got a separate place for my male so i can get him ahead and he's really dumping pollen so
[41:09.060 --> 41:13.780]  he's probably a week ahead of the other so he's putting out good pollen some of that later pollen
[41:13.780 --> 41:18.740]  is better in my opinion the early pollen is good the later pollen seems to be more productive uh
[41:18.740 --> 41:23.540]  not super late but like four or five week six pollen is really good put that on the week three
[41:23.540 --> 41:29.460]  week four females and it really goes shebang so get your boy get him pollinating if you've got
[41:29.460 --> 41:33.540]  one space put them all in there at the same time and do what you've got to do i understand how it
[41:33.540 --> 41:38.740]  goes it will work a lot of the things i talk about are specifics that will dial things in and give you
[41:38.740 --> 41:43.380]  the best results this is growing cannabis on a home grow level i understand sometimes you just
[41:43.380 --> 41:48.260]  got to throw some plants in a room and do what you can do so if that's what you've got to do do that
[41:48.260 --> 41:54.740]  so you got your females in there they're gonna want pollen around day 23 27 30 32 at the latest
[41:54.740 --> 42:01.620]  uh your boy's gonna start dropping pollen around day 12 14 17 he'll start dropping it like 25 by
[42:01.620 --> 42:06.420]  day 30 you can't fucking walk around him because when you touch the floor you could see pollen fall
[42:06.420 --> 42:11.460]  off of him uh that's the point where i would drag him over to the females put him right in the middle
[42:11.460 --> 42:15.860]  of the females and just shake him just grab him right by the base and give him a good shake just
[42:15.860 --> 42:20.340]  like if you're gonna whip somebody with him just whip all those female plants with them uh the
[42:20.340 --> 42:25.380]  pollen is gonna go flying it's gonna go everywhere at this point you're achieving full pollination
[42:25.380 --> 42:30.580]  those plants are getting it um you're gonna taste pollen you're gonna have pollen in your teeth in
[42:30.580 --> 42:34.500]  your nose you're gonna breathe pollen and you're gonna sneeze it's gonna suck you're gonna have
[42:34.500 --> 42:38.340]  bright yellow boogers for a whole day you can't get rid of it no matter what you do your eyes are
[42:38.340 --> 42:43.540]  gonna feel red and itchy i think that part of my redness and weirdness from my eyes today is from
[42:43.540 --> 42:48.340]  pollen big shout out to king solomon for making my eyes itchy it's worth it uh it could be that
[42:48.340 --> 42:53.780]  light could be soly uh but pollinate go in there and just spread that pollen i put the plant right
[42:53.780 --> 42:58.660]  in front of a fan sometimes just let the fan fucking blow the pollen everywhere then i wait
[42:58.660 --> 43:04.660]  a few days maybe one maybe two maybe three days then i will pollinate again now that male plant
[43:04.660 --> 43:09.860]  in my opinion has done his job he's done i will cut him down and smack him against something either
[43:09.860 --> 43:14.580]  the fan or the lights just getting all that pollen out into that room just go sprinkle them
[43:14.580 --> 43:19.380]  all over the female plants make them actually make contact i'm trying to make maximum pollination
[43:19.380 --> 43:24.100]  where every pistol has been pollinated i want maximum seeds because you guys buy every seed
[43:24.100 --> 43:28.420]  that i make and i cannot keep up with you thank you i love you for that but i need to make as many
[43:28.420 --> 43:33.460]  seeds as i can so you drag them in there uh pollinate pollination should happen females
[43:33.460 --> 43:40.500]  are ready i keep saying it around day 23 about day 27 30 32 ish your boys drop in around 17
[43:40.500 --> 43:46.100]  a little bit later is the best pollen day 25 is really killer pollen uh get them in there juice
[43:46.100 --> 43:51.860]  up those girls let the pollination set pollinate one more time cut down the boy clean up the pollen
[43:51.860 --> 43:57.380]  get that boy out of there now you're just dealing with seeded females at this point that's when i
[43:57.380 --> 44:01.860]  put the lights back on 18 6 i've talked about this a lot there are full episodes about this
[44:02.500 --> 44:08.180]  in my opinion this works really well to speed up the finishing process to make the seeds finish
[44:08.180 --> 44:13.700]  faster they finish harder they're fatter they're stronger excuse me for that they're fatter they're
[44:13.700 --> 44:20.340]  stronger some of the best seeds i have ever made have been finished under the 18 6 finishing cycle
[44:20.340 --> 44:25.700]  the best seeds i have ever made were finished under an 18 6 flowering cycle and they were grown
[44:25.700 --> 44:30.100]  under canon leds i'm going to take a quick drink and we'll continue the rant about breeding
[44:30.900 --> 44:35.700]  all right so we've achieved pollination we've put our lights back on 18 6 now we're going to feed
[44:35.700 --> 44:39.780]  the plants the plants in my opinion don't need the bloom boosters like we normally feed them
[44:39.780 --> 44:44.500]  because we're not going for flower when you put your plants on 18 6 let me tell you that this is
[44:44.500 --> 44:48.660]  going to happen they're going to look like shit we've got to give them several weeks for these
[44:48.660 --> 44:54.500]  seeds to finish up the plants are going to revege don't worry don't stress on that we're not growing
[44:54.500 --> 44:59.940]  buds your intention is not to make big pretty flowers at this point at this point we are fully
[44:59.940 --> 45:04.740]  focusing on seeds we are growing a seeded crop you are now growing seeds before we were focused
[45:04.740 --> 45:10.980]  on trichomes and bag of peel flowers now it is just healthy fat seeds the plants are going to
[45:10.980 --> 45:17.780]  go back into a vegetative state because we've got them on an 18 6 lighting cycle in about 14 17 21
[45:17.780 --> 45:21.860]  days you're going to see little new shoots coming out of these plants do not freak out do not panic
[45:21.860 --> 45:26.100]  don't cut them off don't do any weird shit let them keep growing your plants are going to look
[45:26.100 --> 45:31.300]  weird and crazy don't worry you're growing for seeds take a lot of pictures post it to social
[45:31.300 --> 45:34.420]  media see what people think they're going to freak out they're going to tell you cut it down it's a
[45:34.420 --> 45:38.020]  mutant they're not going to know what the fuck is going on just sit back and laugh like a mad
[45:38.020 --> 45:42.900]  scientist because it's really fun to see people freak out on a seeded crop that is fully reveging
[45:43.780 --> 45:48.180]  if you need clones in a few weeks before you harvest you will have clones they'll be popping
[45:48.180 --> 45:52.740]  out right out of the tops of these seeded plants you'll have brand new clones cut those off use
[45:52.740 --> 45:56.820]  them just like normal clones that is a new mother plant don't flower that one out let that one grow
[45:56.820 --> 46:00.900]  out until the leaves get normal again then take clones off of that you can flower those those are
[46:00.900 --> 46:05.540]  your new plants you can get seeds and clones off of the same plant that is a crazy trick that i
[46:05.540 --> 46:10.100]  have done a couple of times so you've got your plants they're on 18 6 they're going to continue
[46:10.100 --> 46:15.380]  to flower they don't need the bloom boosters like they normally do because we're not growing buds
[46:15.380 --> 46:22.340]  they do in my opinion need enjoy and appreciate a little bit of amino acids amino acids are great
[46:22.340 --> 46:26.580]  building blocks to life if you've got a product with aminos some sort of liquid amino in there
[46:26.580 --> 46:31.860]  add that to it also they do like a little extra calmag they're also going to appreciate a little
[46:31.860 --> 46:38.420]  bit of nitrogen if you're a bottle grower i just basically don't switch the veg bottle to the bloom
[46:38.420 --> 46:45.060]  bottle when my feed schedule says put in the excuse me let me fix my brain when the feed schedule says
[46:45.060 --> 46:50.500]  put in the bloom bottle i just don't switch from veg to bloom i continue that veg bottle all the way
[46:50.500 --> 46:57.460]  through the flowering cycle i don't do a flush phase like you normally do that's because we're
[46:57.460 --> 47:02.900]  not going to smoke and i want to feed my seeds so yeah the main nutrient difference is they want a
[47:02.900 --> 47:07.460]  little bit more calmag they want some amino acids and i don't switch to the flowering nutrients i
[47:07.460 --> 47:13.780]  just use that veg bottle most other things are basically the same i don't defoliate as heavily
[47:14.660 --> 47:18.740]  honestly they don't grow as bushy because they're spending most of their energy on making those
[47:18.740 --> 47:23.780]  seeds so then you got to let them finish that's where i'm headed we're feeding them they're going
[47:23.780 --> 47:29.860]  to grow they're just going to keep on growing try to don't get it too humid don't spray try not to
[47:29.860 --> 47:34.740]  spray because you've got seeds in there if you get them too wet too humid those seeds will germinate
[47:34.740 --> 47:39.460]  inside of your buds i've seen it before i've seen little sprouts growing out of live plants it's
[47:39.460 --> 47:44.100]  really beautiful but you just ruined your plants and your seeds and you kind of fucked up everything
[47:44.100 --> 47:48.900]  unless you're trying to make some living soil there's nothing to be used there so let them grow
[47:48.900 --> 47:52.500]  let them continue to grow don't let it get too humid you want it the same conditions as you do
[47:52.500 --> 47:58.100]  a normal grow environment so you're already doing that feed them water them then you will notice
[47:58.100 --> 48:02.260]  that the seeds are starting to get hard a lot of people say how do i know when the seeds are ready
[48:03.060 --> 48:08.180]  hopefully these plants are really seeded up all you have to do is find a branch that you're okay
[48:08.180 --> 48:12.980]  with just kind of kind of mangling a little bit grab a bud and just pinch it and pull out a seed
[48:12.980 --> 48:17.460]  and then roll it between your fingers the butt will fall off the casing will come off all the
[48:17.460 --> 48:20.980]  calyx and all that part will fall onto the floor and you'll just have a seed in your hand pop it
[48:20.980 --> 48:26.020]  right into your hand and check it out is it white is it pale is it gray is it getting tiger striped
[48:26.020 --> 48:31.940]  is it dark is it black then is it hard give it a squeeze if it crushes that's when you can tell a
[48:31.940 --> 48:36.660]  lot when it crushes does it just go squish if nothing comes out you're nowhere near ready
[48:36.660 --> 48:41.700]  if a little white gooey thing comes out you're getting close if it's hard and kind of goes crunch
[48:41.700 --> 48:45.540]  and white gooey shit comes out you're getting really close if it's hard and when you pinch it
[48:45.540 --> 48:50.260]  it makes a little indention in your finger then you're probably ready but go a little bit longer
[48:50.260 --> 48:54.660]  it's going to take six to eight maybe nine weeks for these seeds to harden up honestly from the
[48:54.660 --> 48:59.380]  time you pollinate until the time you cut them down is going to be six to eight maybe nine weeks
[48:59.380 --> 49:05.140]  it is going to be very uh plant specific it's going to be very environmental specific there
[49:05.140 --> 49:09.940]  are a lot of things that will come into play to decide how long these seeds need to go before you
[49:09.940 --> 49:13.940]  harvest them i want to read my notes and make sure i didn't miss anything because i got stoned and i
[49:13.940 --> 49:17.780]  went kind of fast and i did lose track of where i was at one point i want to make sure i don't
[49:17.780 --> 49:23.540]  miss anything for you select plants select a female select a male get them at the right point
[49:23.540 --> 49:29.380]  in flowering put them in the room let them do their magic on each other then switch the light
[49:29.380 --> 49:37.140]  cycle to 18-6 feed them properly basically give them veg nutrients all the way through give them
[49:37.140 --> 49:42.580]  aminos give them calmag give them nitrogen that should keep them happy don't let them get root
[49:42.580 --> 49:50.500]  bound don't get them too humid they're on 18-6 let them go long enough then i think we can talk
[49:50.500 --> 49:56.660]  about harvesting let's harvest one of the best parts about growing for seed is you don't really
[49:56.660 --> 50:01.860]  have to trim it's all just gonna none of it's gonna get smoked well unless you're gonna try
[50:01.860 --> 50:07.220]  i don't do that i don't feel it's useful i feel like it's a waste of time um so before harvest
[50:07.220 --> 50:11.460]  while the plants are still alive still growing still well still turgid is the word i'm looking
[50:11.460 --> 50:17.700]  for i will pull off as many leaves as i can get just defoliate with my hands maybe scissors but
[50:17.700 --> 50:21.620]  put on a pair of gloves and just go pull off all of the leaves because when i cut the plants down
[50:21.620 --> 50:26.500]  i don't need that much leaf on there so i go in i cut off all of the leaves or pull off all of
[50:26.500 --> 50:32.260]  the leaves as many as i can get then uh the next day i cut the plants down and i hang them upside
[50:32.260 --> 50:36.740]  down and put a label on them that way i know that this plant is for sure this plant it was the
[50:36.740 --> 50:41.060]  female this i already know what it was pollinated by because it was my breeding project then i just
[50:41.060 --> 50:46.180]  simply let it dry i don't even put them in a dry and cure room i just hang them in a basement where
[50:46.180 --> 50:50.820]  the air is and they just dry in that natural environment i'm not curing them i'm not drying
[50:50.820 --> 50:55.460]  them specially we're not going to smoke them uh this is all seeded product a lot of people think
[50:55.460 --> 50:59.780]  that it's insane or there's a problem with just seeding this up and not even attempting to save
[50:59.780 --> 51:04.740]  the material by the time i'm done sorting it and getting the seeds out of it it is so beat up that
[51:04.740 --> 51:10.260]  it is not worth it any uh edibles that you make tastes like crap it tastes like chlorophyll any
[51:10.260 --> 51:14.180]  concentrates you make come out green and terrible because it's so beat up it is not worth the time
[51:14.180 --> 51:19.540]  energy and effort uh the material goes into the compost bin or the bokashi bucket is honestly
[51:19.540 --> 51:24.980]  what happens to that material so we cut down the plants they've been defoliated heavily we cut them
[51:24.980 --> 51:29.780]  down they hang upside down or you can lay them on racks if you want but the seeds may start
[51:29.780 --> 51:33.140]  falling out as it dries up as long as you got something to catch the seeds and keep them
[51:33.140 --> 51:37.940]  separated keep them separated so that you don't get any cross contamination or cross labeling of
[51:37.940 --> 51:43.380]  seeds chop the plants down hang them up let them get this is how i do it i let them get crispy
[51:43.380 --> 51:48.900]  crispy crunchy dry they're super butterfinger dry then i will get a container i wish i would
[51:48.900 --> 51:54.420]  have brought one to the table it is a stir light container i believe is the brand stir light makes
[51:54.420 --> 51:57.940]  them rubbermaid makes them there's a bunch of generic brands that make them at the big box
[51:57.940 --> 52:03.220]  stores where they sell you all the plastic shit you can get these containers it's probably 18
[52:03.220 --> 52:08.100]  inches 16 inches tall deep you might want to call it it's about three feet wide and it's about a
[52:08.100 --> 52:14.820]  foot and a half thick um it's like a big box basically it's all a big plastic box i will grab
[52:14.820 --> 52:20.420]  a pair of gloves and i will put my plant in that box and i basically grab the plant by the base of
[52:20.420 --> 52:25.460]  the stalk and i put my hand around all the buds and run my hand right up the main stem and just
[52:25.460 --> 52:30.500]  shuck all the buds right off the stem it is so dry that as i run my hand up the stem and push
[52:30.500 --> 52:35.780]  all these buds off they just fall right off the stick into the container so now all the buds are
[52:35.780 --> 52:40.660]  off the sticks they're all into this container i've got a couple of methods for removing uh the
[52:40.660 --> 52:45.700]  seeds at this point but some of the easiest ways are just put on gloves and just grind it all up
[52:45.700 --> 52:50.500]  with your hands don't smash too hard you'll know when you're going hard enough to destroy seeds
[52:50.500 --> 52:54.580]  but if you've got all the plant matter in that container and you just start grinding it up with
[52:54.580 --> 52:59.540]  your hands you will hear those seeds hitting that bin just ting ting ting ting ting ting ting
[52:59.540 --> 53:05.060]  if you did it right it sounds like it is raining seeds into that container it is a very uh when you
[53:05.060 --> 53:11.300]  grew seeds on purpose and you hear that it is a very satisfying feeling another really effective
[53:11.300 --> 53:15.540]  way of getting these seeds out of these buds is to remove all the buds from the sticks you got to
[53:15.540 --> 53:20.900]  get most of the sticks out because we're going to put all these buds into a one gallon uh ziploc
[53:20.900 --> 53:26.500]  bag as many as you can get it into that one gallon ziploc bag and then i just kind of roll my hands
[53:26.500 --> 53:31.380]  around that bag and squeeze it and crumble it these buds are dusty bone dry so as i'm doing
[53:31.380 --> 53:37.380]  this i'm just making dust out of all of that bud then i personally use a seed sorter i've got a
[53:37.380 --> 53:43.140]  machine that i pour the seeds and all the the other material is called chaff so i pour the chaff
[53:43.140 --> 53:47.780]  and the seed mixture into this one part and seeds come out of one end and the chaff comes out of the
[53:47.780 --> 53:51.860]  other i've got to run it through a couple of times to make sure i don't miss any seeds but once i get
[53:51.860 --> 53:56.420]  the rhythm of the machine i can pull out a lot of seeds quite quickly if you don't have a seed
[53:56.420 --> 54:01.140]  sorter there are a lot of ways to figure out how to get the seeds uh remember that the seeds roll
[54:01.140 --> 54:04.740]  and the chaff is fluffy and stays at the top you could do it just like we used to back in the day
[54:04.740 --> 54:09.540]  get an album run the seat run the material up to album and the seeds fall down the material stays
[54:09.540 --> 54:16.980]  at the top there are a lot of ways to do it this is uh a seed breeders version of trimming you guys
[54:16.980 --> 54:20.500]  out there trimming you always talk about how you want to put the scissors in your eye and that you
[54:20.500 --> 54:25.620]  hate trimming uh pulling the seeds out is that's the headache for a breeder if you don't have the
[54:25.620 --> 54:31.300]  machine if you've got the machines they will do you very well there is the easy grow seed sorter
[54:31.300 --> 54:37.300]  is what i think it's called the easy seed seed sorter that is a great machine uh my buddy cascadian
[54:37.300 --> 54:42.740]  grown is putting out the larger models if you need something to do a few more seeds uh cascadian
[54:42.740 --> 54:47.860]  growns is actually more affordable so find him on social media shout out to cascadian grown there you
[54:47.860 --> 54:52.180]  go brother free plug just because i want to support the community also there's another guy i saw
[54:52.900 --> 54:59.860]  damn i really wish i remember who saw the uh who made the plastic 3d printed version it was smaller
[55:00.500 --> 55:05.540]  but still all three great products uh no bias no uh yeah just three products you could use they're
[55:05.540 --> 55:10.980]  all three seed sorters another thing i've seen done i think i learned this from mr soul i like
[55:10.980 --> 55:15.540]  to share uh resources so you don't think i'm a wizard i do learn shit from a lot of other people
[55:15.540 --> 55:21.860]  mr soul puts his buds he takes the sticks out he's got just buds in a five gallon bucket and he taught
[55:21.860 --> 55:27.620]  us to get a drill and then at the hardware store they sell a paddle that is a drill bit so it hooks
[55:27.620 --> 55:31.780]  into your drill just like a normal drill bit but it is to stir paint is what i believe it was
[55:31.780 --> 55:37.060]  originally made for and you put your drill on like a low setting so you don't destroy the seeds
[55:37.060 --> 55:42.020]  and just go into the five gallon bucket and just give it a few zip zip zip you don't want to go in
[55:42.020 --> 55:48.260]  there and murder it but give it a few zaps and if the material is dry enough just give it a zip
[55:48.260 --> 55:52.420]  it'll just shatter that material and rupture the material and the seeds just go fly into the edge
[55:52.420 --> 55:57.220]  of the bucket it will not break the seeds if you put it on a low setting and you do it gently and
[55:57.220 --> 56:00.900]  pay attention if you go in there and start fucking mashing them on the bottom and making mashed
[56:00.900 --> 56:04.900]  potatoes out of it you'll destroy the seeds but if you're smooth about it you pay attention watch
[56:04.900 --> 56:09.940]  what you're doing you will not destroy the seeds it is a quick way to get them out then all of the
[56:09.940 --> 56:13.620]  chaff is at the top all the seeds are at the bottom pull out a few handfuls of the chaff
[56:13.620 --> 56:20.020]  that'll help you out start starting those seeds much more quickly seriously pulling the seeds out
[56:20.020 --> 56:25.300]  is uh the really the challenging part unless you're making packages i package seeds by hand
[56:25.300 --> 56:29.060]  every seed that you buy was packaged by me i touched that seed i rolled it on the table made
[56:29.060 --> 56:34.740]  it was hard made sure it was hard that was weird uh touch that seed made sure it was hard all right
[56:34.740 --> 56:38.420]  rolled it on the table made sure it was hard i put all those seeds into the packaging myself
[56:38.420 --> 56:42.180]  uh i like to touch them but counting to 10 and counting to 12 and counting to 6 does get quite
[56:42.180 --> 56:46.740]  tedious i make sure to put extra seeds in there for you but uh that is my version of trimming
[56:46.740 --> 56:50.980]  that's what i'm just like all right my eyes are crossed i need a break so we've gotten all the
[56:50.980 --> 56:55.140]  way to selecting plants we've gotten all the way up to harvesting we've gotten to pulling the seeds
[56:55.220 --> 56:59.620]  out uh now you've got to count them it's always good to count your seeds i know that sounds tedious
[56:59.620 --> 57:03.460]  and monotonous i've got a machine that does that i simply drop my seeds in a machine and i hit go
[57:03.460 --> 57:07.780]  and it vibrates and it counts the seeds for me beautiful beautiful machine uh hopefully you've
[57:07.780 --> 57:11.700]  got a friend maybe a lovely girlfriend or somebody that will sit around and count seeds with you
[57:11.700 --> 57:15.140]  uh just count them out sometimes you could do it by weight you'll get close enough if you just want
[57:15.140 --> 57:19.540]  a good idea uh sometimes you could tell that this many in a baggie is about a thousand seeds you'll
[57:19.540 --> 57:24.820]  get good at it eventually count them because you want to know how many seeds you made because you
[57:24.820 --> 57:28.500]  want to know how many you make next time so that you can make if you make five more next time that's
[57:28.500 --> 57:32.900]  improvement uh but you want to just document stuff i like to make a lot of notes i like to make
[57:32.900 --> 57:36.500]  excessive notes that way i know where progress is i know where i'm slacking i know where i'm
[57:36.500 --> 57:41.300]  improving all right now let's talk about the most rewarding part of this entire project now it is
[57:41.300 --> 57:46.580]  time to grow the seeds we have produced did we make trash did we make the next gems did we make
[57:46.580 --> 57:50.740]  the newest chem dog did we make the new gorilla glue did we make the new popular shit that's
[57:50.740 --> 57:56.180]  gonna have everybody lined up at the dispensary or did we just make a bunch of intersex mutant
[57:56.180 --> 58:01.140]  plants and nobody wants to grow the only way to find that out is to sprout them and grow them the
[58:01.140 --> 58:06.660]  first thing you want to document is germination rate however many seeds you grow write it down
[58:07.380 --> 58:13.220]  how many germinated write that down that is your germination rate if you popped 10 seeds and only
[58:13.220 --> 58:18.820]  seven of them sprouted you've got a 70 germination rate not really acceptable for commercial seeds
[58:18.820 --> 58:24.100]  those are good for you you need at least 80 germination to put them out to market 90 is better
[58:24.740 --> 58:29.700]  if they don't have 90 germination rate at least put 13 seeds in that package when you sell them
[58:29.700 --> 58:33.780]  do something like that to help the people out but you need a good germination rate so test these
[58:33.780 --> 58:39.540]  seeds germ them out then see how they grow veg them take notes as they veg if you've got 10 of
[58:39.540 --> 58:43.300]  them you should label them however you want you can name them you can number them you can letter
[58:43.300 --> 58:48.180]  them but just make notes write that plant number one grows like shit plant number two grows amazing
[58:48.180 --> 58:52.500]  plant number three it's kind of weird plant number four is the one i want to keep already
[58:52.500 --> 58:57.300]  make notes because you're not going to remember this is going to be a long process and you're so
[58:57.300 --> 59:01.780]  excited all your mental notes are going to get foggy so make a lot of notes grow these out
[59:02.420 --> 59:06.660]  you can grow them as big as you want you can grow them as small as you want but flower them out
[59:06.660 --> 59:11.060]  do your testing process however you want to test them do you want to grow them big and top them
[59:11.060 --> 59:15.540]  and spread them out and see what they do i like to run kind of a scientific test i run them once
[59:15.540 --> 59:21.860]  again in a six inch net pot untopped veg them for about two or three weeks get them big enough just
[59:21.860 --> 59:26.180]  to see the shape of the plant then put it into flower then i'll find out very quickly if those
[59:26.180 --> 59:31.300]  plants show intersex traits if they're mutants if they're weirdos i can find what they smell taste
[59:31.300 --> 59:36.740]  look like i can find production very quickly i can achieve production very quickly and find winners
[59:36.740 --> 59:43.060]  and losers very quickly in less than 100 days if i do it by just flowering them out really quickly
[59:43.060 --> 59:46.180]  then you could dry them cure them smoke them with the crew take a bunch of pictures and see
[59:46.180 --> 59:52.580]  what you've got it's about 100 day process maybe 120 if you veg them for too long so grow them out
[59:52.580 --> 59:56.900]  see what you've got if you want to go bigger you can i like a small test grow it just makes more
[59:56.900 --> 01:00:01.380]  sense to me why grow big ass plants i don't even take a clone a lot of times on my test grows i've
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.220]  got a thousand seeds grown out 10 of them if i find something cool in there i'll grow more seeds
[01:00:05.220 --> 01:00:09.460]  of that but just grow them out find what we've got why do i want to spend a bunch of time growing
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:15.540]  something that could be trash it could be amazing but it also could be trash and if i waste soil
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:20.820]  time electricity nutrients water real estate in the grow on plants that were shit then that's
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:26.580]  frustrating so veg them flower them out see what we've got smoke them yourself smoke them with
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:31.300]  your friends smoke them with if you're a medical grower smoke them with whoever is consuming them
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:36.340]  medically if you are a profit grower smoke them with your favorite customers give them to them
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:40.180]  as a sample be like here's numbers one two and three let me know what you liked better and they're
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:43.700]  gonna love you for that they're gonna you let me get you let me pick which one you're gonna grow
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:48.980]  and they'll think it's custom for them and shit so uh select the best ones the best one i don't
[01:00:48.980 --> 01:00:53.300]  like the word ones select it's one plural it's weird select the best one or the plants that
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:58.900]  work the best for you then continue to grow those those all right my face is wearing out so at this
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:03.700]  point you've grown out a bunch of the plants uh you found males females you know how many males
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:07.460]  and females come out of a pack you know your germination rate you know what kind of turps
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.180]  you're getting from each cross you can see now what that male did to each cross did it over
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:17.140]  dominate everything did it add a nice something to everything did it work the way that you expected
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:22.180]  it we said start this with a goal did you meet a goal did you exceed your goal did you forget about
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:26.660]  the goal did you do something totally different that wasn't your goal but still amazing just
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:31.300]  document that and then when you do it again you got some sort of document some sort of record so
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:38.500]  um are the seeds you made better than the parents did you improve upon cannabis did you improve
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:43.860]  upon the species if you paid money for these seeds would you be happy with that uh is there
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:47.780]  a reason to grow these seeds again was this just something you would have done one time or do you
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:52.500]  want to keep growing these because you probably have a lot of them are you letting yourself and
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:58.340]  your ego get in the way of quality control did you fall in love with this breeding project uh
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:01.700]  you know how your friend your friend the soundcloud rapper thinks that every beat he
[01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:06.580]  makes is the best beat ever but it's the same beat he's been making since eighth grade are you doing
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:10.500]  that with your breeding are you saying this is the best shit ever bro but it's really just the
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.820]  same beat you made in eighth grade just trying to relive it because your ego is in the way and you
[01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.220]  really should just fucking delete that and move on and try something new don't let your ego get in
[01:02:19.220 --> 01:02:25.700]  the way of your breeding um i've done it i've been super proud of shit and then been like but but but
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:30.580]  and then if i catch myself saying but but then i already know that i just need to but but just
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:36.340]  move on that shit ain't worth but but but move on there are so many plants to work with so many male
[01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:40.580]  plants so many female plants you can make feminized plants which will be a whole another podcast we do
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:44.260]  not have time for that rabbit hole there are so many plants to play with why would you want to
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:49.300]  waste time with something uh that isn't moving the cannabis species the plant the industry the
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:54.260]  community forward why do you want to stall it out and stand still so if your breeding isn't perfect
[01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:58.900]  isn't amazing just abandon the project let's start over let's do something different unless you find
[01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.620]  a trait in there that you really want to isolate work with breed again you'll know it if you see
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:09.620]  it you'll know what i'm talking about all right uh we got all the way through this i think yeah i
[01:03:09.620 --> 01:03:15.940]  think so there will be a couple of quick edits but i think we did a good breeding podcast this should
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:20.420]  spark a lot of questions i really hope i get a lot of feedback a lot of response from this episode
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:24.580]  these grow lessons really do get a lot of notice thank you we're getting a lot of traction on the

[01:05:49.620 --> 01:05:54.260]  genetics.com a lot of people just found out today that i am a seed breeder they're going to be very
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:59.460]  interested in my seeds my website is i read genetics.com on that website you will find a list
[01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:05.300]  of breeders at the top of that list is seedsherenow.com use coupon code gfyh10 that will save
[01:06:05.300 --> 01:06:11.460]  you 10 at seedsherenow.com you'll find a wonderful list of breed of vendors there i may have said
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:17.220]  breeders a moment ago i meant a list of vendors uh those folks all carry my seeds some will have
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:21.940]  some stuff in stock some won't have some stuff in stock some will have five packs some will have 10
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:26.580]  packs uh some will have different prices some will take different cards some will take different
[01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:31.460]  payment methods there will be variances on the websites find what works best for you find who's
[01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:36.260]  got what you need in stock find who takes your payment method find who ships to you you're gonna
[01:06:36.260 --> 01:06:42.820]  have to do a little bit of research but it's all there on ireegenetics.com all right i'm gonna wrap
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:46.500]  this up because i don't need to ramble for too much longer thank you once again for listening
