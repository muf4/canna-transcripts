[01:04.710 --> 01:10.790]  smoking today. I've been taking dabs of Shapeshifter Full Spectrum Extract. This is a blend of
[01:10.790 --> 01:17.190]  Headbanger and Land Race Afghani. On the package, the flavor is described as sour apple, fuel,
[01:17.190 --> 01:22.190]  and soft fruit. I definitely got the sour apple and fuel part. I feel like I may have
[01:22.190 --> 01:27.270]  been skipped on that soft fruit portion of the flavor. However, I do appreciate and enjoy
[01:27.270 --> 01:32.470]  that sour apple and fuel flavor. It's got a nice buzz to it. On the back of the package,
[01:32.710 --> 01:39.590]  the product does contain 75.21% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:39.590 --> 01:44.550]  Big shout out to the Shapeshifter Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:44.550 --> 01:49.350]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to read a few Patreon messages. Before we get there,
[01:49.350 --> 01:54.230]  let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club. Of course, the 710 Club are the
[01:54.230 --> 02:00.630]  folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher. So with no further ado,
[02:00.630 --> 02:04.550]  let's start it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to the Captain
[02:04.550 --> 02:09.190]  and Commander of the 710 Club. Let's send a big thank you shout out to Lemur Priest.
[02:09.190 --> 02:13.750]  Let's follow that up with a new contributor. Let's send a big thank you shout out to Brian C.
[02:13.750 --> 02:18.630]  I also want to send a big thank you shout out to Adam H. and Justin T. Let's follow that up with
[02:18.630 --> 02:24.070]  a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to 716 Vibes. I want to follow that up with a
[02:24.070 --> 02:29.110]  thank you shout out to Kurt C. and Aaron. I've got a special thank you shout out for Danny Dave.
[02:29.110 --> 02:33.910]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Papa Z and 057. Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart
[02:33.910 --> 02:40.390]  Podcast thank you shout out to OkieGrow720. And last but certainly not least, I want to send a big
[02:40.390 --> 02:46.070]  Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to our friend, The BAFSTA. Big thanks and big
[02:46.070 --> 02:50.630]  shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon. If you're not already
[02:50.630 --> 02:54.390]  supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so, all you have to do is visit
[02:54.390 --> 03:01.670]  www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information you need to support
[03:01.670 --> 03:06.230]  the show will be right there on the screen. And I did include a link in the show notes and in the
[03:06.230 --> 03:10.790]  video description to make it nice and easy for everybody who may have their hands full while
[03:10.790 --> 03:14.870]  they're listening to the show. Perhaps you're driving, maybe you're at work, maybe you're in
[03:14.870 --> 03:19.270]  the cubicle. I don't need you getting in trouble. I don't need you in a wreck. Patreon will be there
[03:19.270 --> 03:25.670]  when you get to your destination. Also, if you are a Patreon contributor, I did change some of the
[03:25.670 --> 03:32.310]  details on some of the tiers on Patreon. So make sure you check on the details on the level on
[03:32.310 --> 03:36.390]  which you are contributing. That was harder to say than it looked. But make sure you are still
[03:36.390 --> 03:41.030]  getting what you expect on your Patreon tier. If you feel as if I owe you something on Patreon,
[03:41.030 --> 03:46.790]  please don't be shy. Send me a message and I will fulfill my commitments. Also, I've noticed a few
[03:46.790 --> 03:52.230]  people were posting that Patreon did not renew for them. For some reason, Patreon is an automatic
[03:52.230 --> 03:58.230]  renewal service. Several people posted a message that it did not auto renew. If you think you are
[03:58.230 --> 04:02.150]  contributing to Patreon and you did not see that on your credit card statement this month or your
[04:02.150 --> 04:06.870]  PayPal statement, however you're covering it, please make sure that you are still contributing
[04:06.870 --> 04:11.670]  to the Patreon contributors, which you think you may be contributing to. Not just my show,
[04:11.670 --> 04:15.830]  but there are other shows you may be contributing to as well. I do contribute to several
[04:15.910 --> 04:20.630]  Patreon campaigns. I made sure I'm still hooking all of them up. They're all getting their
[04:20.630 --> 04:25.670]  contributions. But just a reminder, make sure that your Patreon is going through because some people,
[04:25.670 --> 04:29.830]  for some reason, theirs just did not go through. All right, that is enough rambles for there.
[04:30.790 --> 04:35.430]  Let's talk about the obvious part of the podcast. You may have noticed by now if you were watching
[04:35.430 --> 04:41.510]  on the audio or on the video version of the podcast that I have got a sweet new setup. I'm
[04:41.510 --> 04:45.590]  sure you could see the wall behind me has got a fresh coat of gray paint. I think it makes the
[04:45.590 --> 04:51.350]  video pop. It makes it look super fresh. We got a brand new table, got some brand new chairs.
[04:51.350 --> 04:55.990]  I like this table. It's kind of higher up than the old table was. The old table gave me that
[04:55.990 --> 05:01.190]  slouching down, like slouched over your meal. It was a dinner table. This is more of a higher table.
[05:01.190 --> 05:06.150]  It gives you just a different vibe. It gives me a different vibe. I feel like I'm sitting up more,
[05:06.150 --> 05:11.590]  not as slouchy, just more presentable. I feel like I'm ready to present. My chair is also a
[05:11.590 --> 05:15.350]  little bit taller. It's more like a bar stool with the back on it. It's nice and comfy. It's
[05:15.350 --> 05:20.710]  got some padding on it. But this new setup makes me feel like I am more in a presentation mode,
[05:20.710 --> 05:25.510]  less of a chill out mode. So this should improve my attitude. And my attitude was fine before,
[05:25.510 --> 05:31.030]  but it should improve my performance here on the podcast subconsciously. Also, I got this sweet new
[05:31.030 --> 05:35.510]  Joe Rogan mic. If you're watching, you could see the sweet mic setup. It's making me sound great,
[05:35.510 --> 05:40.710]  I think. If you are only listening in the audio format, let me know. What do you think of this new
[05:40.710 --> 05:45.590]  format? I've also got the sweet mic arm. We've got a cloud lifter. We've got a brand new recording
[05:45.590 --> 05:51.430]  device. I'm actually recording with a podcat Zoom for... Let me try that all over again. I'm
[05:51.430 --> 05:57.270]  actually recording with a Zoom PodTrak P4. That's really hard to say. Those are a lot of the same
[05:57.270 --> 06:02.390]  words in a sentence there. I really like this piece of equipment. It is easy to run the sound.
[06:02.390 --> 06:06.950]  I can get my audio into my headphones. I can get the audio into the camera. I can play the
[06:06.950 --> 06:11.350]  background music with the press of a button, which makes life very easy for somebody trying
[06:11.350 --> 06:17.110]  to produce by themselves. So we've got all new audio equipment. We've also got some sweet lights.
[06:17.110 --> 06:21.350]  I am well lit, and it is not just from the dabs this time. I've got a light here. I got a light
[06:21.350 --> 06:25.590]  here. You may have noticed there's a light behind me, giving me some space from the wall. I really
[06:25.590 --> 06:29.750]  think it looks good. I would love your feedback. What do you think of the new appearance? Also,
[06:30.390 --> 06:34.790]  the obvious part, there is a brand new camera. If you're watching, I'm sure you could tell that
[06:34.790 --> 06:39.990]  video quality is nice and crispy. It looks so much better. I'm not sure that I was ready for 4K,
[06:39.990 --> 06:44.070]  but that's what we're doing. I'll get some sun on this forehead for you. Don't worry.
[06:44.070 --> 06:49.990]  But anyway, I wanted to thank everybody for the Patreon contributions, because that is what covered
[06:49.990 --> 06:54.550]  this new equipment. I did make a video for Patreon, but if you did not catch that on Patreon,
[06:54.550 --> 07:00.550]  I wanted to make sure that you heard my thank you. Thank you. Without all the Patreon contributions,
[07:00.550 --> 07:04.790]  this new setup would not have happened. This was, it wasn't super expensive, but there was some
[07:04.790 --> 07:09.430]  money to put into this. I bought a lot of gear. I bought a brand new camera. There was some manual
[07:09.430 --> 07:13.670]  labor done. We had some painting done. We had some new lights put in above us. I had to do a lot
[07:13.670 --> 07:18.470]  of shopping. I am still seeking some kind of background stuff. I feel like we could use a
[07:18.470 --> 07:22.710]  plant or something back here on the sides, but for now, I think it looks marvelous. I want your
[07:22.710 --> 07:27.350]  feedback. What do you think of the new video setup? What do you think of the new audio setup?
[07:27.350 --> 07:31.830]  And what would I put right here? Do you have any decoration ideas for some shit that could go here?
[07:31.830 --> 07:36.310]  I was thinking like a plant and a shelf or something, but really what I'm looking for has not
[07:36.310 --> 07:41.030]  jumped out at me. I feel like when it is the right thing, I'll say that's the shit right there that
[07:41.030 --> 07:46.070]  goes behind me on the podcast. But I would love your feedback. Let me know what you think. Video,
[07:46.070 --> 07:51.830]  audio, decorative, whatever's on your mind. I would love some feedback. Also, be patient with me,
[07:51.830 --> 07:55.590]  because there is going to be a learning curve while I learn this new equipment.
[07:55.590 --> 07:59.430]  Things will not be perfect right away. Maybe they will. I don't know. I don't expect things to go
[07:59.430 --> 08:04.150]  smoothly on the first try. They never do. And if they do, they go wrong on the fourth or fifth try
[08:04.150 --> 08:09.510]  anyway. But bear with me while I adjust to the new equipment and to the learning curve. But I do
[08:09.510 --> 08:14.870]  encourage you, please, please keep sending me all of the questions. I want all of your grow questions.
[08:14.870 --> 08:20.230]  Those keep the show moving. I also still want all of the feedback and words of encouragement and
[08:20.230 --> 08:24.870]  updates and corrections and all of that stuff. Keep that stuff coming. My email address is
[08:24.870 --> 08:31.030]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Please don't stop with the feedback, the updates, the questions
[08:31.030 --> 08:37.590]  while I adjust to the new equipment. Keep sending me stuff. I like it. Also, I just wanted to say
[08:37.590 --> 08:42.630]  about the new setup. Patreon saw it first. I posted a video to Patreon. They got to see a
[08:42.630 --> 08:47.990]  couple of teases. They saw some of the equipment before you did. They saw a full-length video
[08:47.990 --> 08:53.750]  before you did. So follow us on Patreon, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[08:53.750 --> 08:57.670]  All right. I feel like I have been kind of rambling on enough about the new setup. Let's
[08:57.670 --> 09:04.230]  jump into the main topic of this podcast. I've got some Patreon messages and some other messages.
[09:04.230 --> 09:09.350]  This one was on the top of the list and it goes a lot like this. It says, Hey man,
[09:09.350 --> 09:15.350]  I don't want to come off negative about anything you do, but there's always a but. It says,
[09:15.350 --> 09:19.830]  but I have concerns about you spending a lot of money on gear. I would rather you put it into
[09:19.830 --> 09:24.950]  your garden. I understand those may be two of the same, but I typically listen on Google podcasts
[09:24.950 --> 09:30.230]  while I'm driving. So I wouldn't appreciate the video format as much as others. The other concern
[09:30.230 --> 09:35.830]  with the video is the fact that it will take up an extreme amount of your time. We'll get to that.
[09:35.830 --> 09:40.310]  It says video editing software takes an enormous amount of time to learn. And once learned,
[09:40.310 --> 09:45.350]  it can easily take a hundred times the amount of time to edit those videos as it does just to
[09:45.350 --> 09:50.710]  shoot them. It also takes away from your time for your personal replies to so many cultivators who
[09:50.710 --> 09:56.470]  rely on you. I really like the simple format and how you can turn audio into a learning experience
[09:56.470 --> 10:01.510]  for me. I just don't have the time to sit and watch videos, although many others may, and it
[10:01.510 --> 10:06.310]  will help them tremendously. Keep up the good work. Don't let this discourage you and your path. These
[10:06.310 --> 10:13.110]  are just my thoughts on a lot of gear and the time commitment it'll take in which to utilize that.
[10:13.110 --> 10:19.190]  All right. This is wonderful feedback. I do appreciate it. However, um, bro, I know you only
[10:19.190 --> 10:25.510]  listen on Google podcasts, but the show has been in a video format since around episode 500. I think
[10:25.510 --> 10:32.870]  we had Mike on, on episode five 30, this is five 82. I've been doing a video for at least 50 episodes
[10:32.870 --> 10:39.030]  now. And I don't feel like it has taken away from the quality of the content of the podcast.
[10:39.030 --> 10:43.590]  In any way, I feel like I'm keeping up with my commitments, my promises. I don't feel like I
[10:43.590 --> 10:47.990]  have slacked. I feel like it is only getting better with this new setup. I've got some more
[10:47.990 --> 10:53.910]  space. I've got some more room. I've got some more ideas. People have been asking to see more visual
[10:53.910 --> 10:59.110]  aids on the show. And that is coming. I do intend to visually teach on the show a little bit better.
[10:59.110 --> 11:03.910]  I can only relay so much information. I can only convey so many ideas. I can only paint
[11:03.910 --> 11:08.150]  such a good picture with my words. Some things I'm going to have to get a plant out and show
[11:08.150 --> 11:12.470]  you exactly what I'm talking about. Show you step-by-step what I need you to do,
[11:12.470 --> 11:17.670]  what I want you to do, what would be better for your grow. So I do need this visual platform for
[11:17.670 --> 11:22.550]  teaching. So I think this will be a way to teach people better to reach a larger audience and just
[11:22.550 --> 11:28.150]  give a better lesson and education. And that's what we're here for. So I will not let the video
[11:28.150 --> 11:34.710]  format distract from the quality of the overall podcast. I will not let it take away from my
[11:34.710 --> 11:39.590]  interaction with my audience, the people who need my support, my friends, my family. Honestly,
[11:39.590 --> 11:44.390]  I've been doing the video show for quite a few episodes now. It took me a minute to learn editing
[11:44.390 --> 11:50.470]  software, but I did it on the fly. I did it. I gave myself a crash course and I always find
[11:50.470 --> 11:55.510]  the quick ways to do things. I try to make a very productive workflow for myself and I managed a way
[11:55.510 --> 12:02.150]  to do that learning video. So that happened quite quickly. The software was, it's in my Mac book
[12:02.150 --> 12:08.390]  already. So that was basically free. The equipment was covered honestly by Patreon. All of this new
[12:08.390 --> 12:15.030]  equipment, even this old Mac book was covered by Patreon contributions. So this money was owed to
[12:15.030 --> 12:19.750]  the podcast. It was owed to the people watching the show. So I didn't spend a bunch of money on
[12:19.750 --> 12:25.910]  gear that wasn't needed. I spent money that was given to me by Patreon contributors to make the
[12:25.910 --> 12:30.630]  show better. So they are getting what they paid for. I think I owed that to them. If I would have
[12:30.630 --> 12:34.950]  put it in my garden, if I would have spent that Patreon money on my garden, that would have been
[12:34.950 --> 12:39.350]  ripping off the Patreon contributors. That would have been going to a totally different avenue,
[12:39.350 --> 12:43.910]  a different business, my own personal thing or my own business. This is where that funding needed
[12:43.910 --> 12:48.230]  to stay. So I gave it back to the show by doing this. And I do have more things coming and there
[12:48.230 --> 12:53.670]  are costs of doing a podcast, but I feel like this was the necessary move. I feel like I mostly
[12:53.670 --> 12:58.950]  covered your, your concern here, bro. There will never be a beat missed. I'll never miss a step.
[12:58.950 --> 13:03.270]  I may have to learn some editing stuff. There may be a couple of glitches in the recordings. You may
[13:03.270 --> 13:09.590]  not get 120% like you were before, but I promise you I'll give you 90%. And once I get it learned,
[13:09.590 --> 13:13.750]  you'll be getting a hundred. I'm giving a hundred percent of my effort, but the show may not be a
[13:13.750 --> 13:18.310]  hundred percent what it was because learning new shit, but I promise you 90%. I won't put out
[13:18.310 --> 13:23.030]  anything better than a 90. If it's an 85, we're going to re-record it and fix it. Don't worry. So
[13:23.750 --> 13:29.830]  I appreciate your concern. Thank you for addressing that concern. But I think I've got it under
[13:29.830 --> 13:34.390]  control, dude. I can edit these videos quite quickly. I can shoot them super quickly. And
[13:35.190 --> 13:39.990]  you guys will never notice that I changed anything other than the fact that the videos look fucking
[13:39.990 --> 13:45.190]  super great now. All right. That came from our friend, JG, who's a Patreon contributor. Thank
[13:45.190 --> 13:50.470]  you, JG, for the great message. I look forward to hearing from you in the future. All right. I do
[13:50.470 --> 13:55.510]  have another message that I'd like to jump right into. This one came from Grandpa Mark and it says,
[13:55.510 --> 14:00.230]  what's up, Rasta Jeff? I have a flowering question. What's up, Grandpa Mark? Good to hear from you.
[14:00.230 --> 14:05.590]  I've got an answer for your flowering question. It says, I have two sun kiss plants and one
[14:05.590 --> 14:11.750]  lemon Jeffrey. All of them are at day 18 of flower. Makes total sense so far. It says,
[14:11.750 --> 14:18.070]  the sun kiss plants are loaded with buds, but the lemon Jeffrey is hardly showing signs of flower.
[14:18.070 --> 14:23.990]  Do you have any ideas? I can't seem to be able to attach a pic. Yes, it is challenging to attach a
[14:23.990 --> 14:29.110]  photo in Patreon. A couple of people have told me that. You can always just email it to me. I
[14:29.110 --> 14:33.910]  read genetics at hotmail.com or growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Both of those will get to my
[14:33.910 --> 14:41.110]  inbox. But let's talk about this. Our friend is growing two different types of genetics and one
[14:41.110 --> 14:46.070]  of them looks like it's loaded with buds and the other one isn't showing any buds. This one is
[14:46.070 --> 14:52.710]  being stingy. So why may this be happening? I bred both of these strains, so I know a lot about these
[14:52.710 --> 14:58.630]  plants. I know that the sun kiss takes off much more quickly. I know that platinum tangy that it
[14:58.630 --> 15:05.030]  came from sets into flower much earlier than the lemon Jeffrey. So I know, I think that what is
[15:05.030 --> 15:09.670]  happening here is just its basic genetics, just the performance of the plant. That sun kiss is
[15:09.670 --> 15:15.750]  going to set into flower really quickly and it's going to finish more earlier than that lemon
[15:15.750 --> 15:19.910]  Jeffrey. The lemon Jeffrey plant is going to take a little bit longer to set into bud, but once it
[15:19.910 --> 15:26.150]  does, it is really going to take off and give you gigantic buds, but it will take a little bit longer
[15:26.150 --> 15:31.510]  than those sun kiss plants. So what I think is happening is it just takes a little bit longer.
[15:31.510 --> 15:36.230]  That plant is a longer growing plant. I'm going to say that your sun kiss will probably take 60
[15:36.230 --> 15:40.630]  days. Your lemon Jeffrey is probably going to take 72 days. Somewhere along that time,
[15:40.630 --> 15:46.470]  the lemon Jeffrey will catch up and or surpass the growth of that sun kiss. That is my first
[15:46.470 --> 15:52.230]  suspicion. My other suspicion is that perhaps just maybe there is a light leak that is getting to the
[15:52.230 --> 15:57.590]  lemon Jeffrey that is not affecting those sun kiss plants. Is the lemon Jeffrey right in the
[15:57.590 --> 16:01.670]  front of the tent where that zipper is? Is it getting some light? Is it right underneath the
[16:01.670 --> 16:06.630]  ducting port where some light could be coming in? That is my suspicion that perhaps possibly,
[16:06.630 --> 16:11.830]  I'm not accusing you. This is an option. I'm just trying to cover bases here. There could be a light
[16:11.830 --> 16:16.790]  leak in the room. The way to solve that is to go in the room and turn off all of the lights in the
[16:16.790 --> 16:22.310]  grow environment, but leave any of the external lights on that may be on during the day. So if
[16:22.310 --> 16:26.550]  this little square is the grow room, turn off. I'm making a square with my hands for the people
[16:26.550 --> 16:31.670]  listening. Turn off all the lights in your square, but leave these outer lights on and go in your
[16:31.670 --> 16:36.230]  grow space and see do these outer lights shine into your grow environment. If you can see your
[16:36.230 --> 16:43.190]  hand in front of your face, it is too light in there. We need 100% total absolute pitch black
[16:43.190 --> 16:49.510]  darkness in there. So that is my first assumption is perhaps just maybe you've got a light leak in
[16:49.510 --> 16:53.990]  there preventing that plant from going into flower. All right, Grandpa Mark, I want to thank
[16:53.990 --> 16:58.870]  you for a great message. I hope I answered your question. I do look forward to an update. Let me
[16:58.870 --> 17:03.270]  know what you find. This message was sent a few days ago. By the time this episode comes out,
[17:03.270 --> 17:07.190]  your plants will have progressed. Let me know what's going on, brother. I look forward to
[17:07.190 --> 17:12.230]  hearing from you. All right. I do have another great message. This one is going to take us a
[17:12.310 --> 17:17.190]  few minutes to address, which is really good. So let's get right into it. This one says,
[17:17.190 --> 17:22.470]  Help! And it's, they're serious. It's in capitals and an exclamation point. It says, Help! I have
[17:22.470 --> 17:28.310]  powdery mildew. Powdery mildew is easy to solve. It is easier to prevent. And we're going to talk
[17:28.310 --> 17:32.470]  about that. Don't panic when you have powdery mildew. A lot of people go into full freakout
[17:32.470 --> 17:37.430]  mode and they cause more problems. They spread the mildew. Don't do that. We're going to talk
[17:37.430 --> 17:41.990]  a little bit about it. It says, I would love to you love, fucking let me try that again. I would
[17:41.990 --> 17:49.030]  love for you to go through what needs to be done to banish this from inside my garden. Then it says,
[17:49.030 --> 17:55.670]  Neem oil is on the way. Return it. Don't use the neem oil. I never recommend neem oil. Neem oil is
[17:55.670 --> 18:01.030]  unhealthy. It is not good for your body. It's not good for reproductive systems. It's just not a
[18:01.030 --> 18:05.110]  good product to be using in your grow at this time. We've got much better products we can use.
[18:05.750 --> 18:11.030]  Also, it will never go away. That flavor will be on your plants forever. When you harvest them,
[18:11.030 --> 18:14.390]  when you dry them, you cure them, you make concentrates. It's going to taste like shit.
[18:14.390 --> 18:19.830]  Let's avoid neem oil. Do your own research on the damage that neem oil and neem products do
[18:19.830 --> 18:25.670]  to your reproductive system or can possibly do to a human reproductive system. We all like our
[18:25.670 --> 18:30.230]  reproductive stuff. At least most of us do anyway. Do your own research there. Let's talk about this.
[18:30.230 --> 18:33.910]  It says, I've been growing and learning about making my own medicine for a little bit over a
[18:33.910 --> 18:39.190]  year. I am so grateful to have found your podcast. It has taught me so much. I am grateful that you
[18:39.190 --> 18:42.950]  have found us as well. We're going to make a great team together. It says, keep doing the
[18:42.950 --> 18:50.390]  fantastic job. Truly, Sab70. Thank you for the great compliment. Thank you for the great message
[18:50.390 --> 18:55.510]  right here on the new podcast format. This is a great topic to cover on this new format. This is
[18:55.510 --> 19:01.350]  a really good subject to talk about in the new studio space. Let's quit rambling and get right
[19:01.350 --> 19:06.470]  into it. A moment ago, I said the best way to treat powdery mildew is to prevent it. Once you've
[19:06.470 --> 19:11.270]  got it, it can be problematic. It can be scary if you're moving it from garden to garden, but I
[19:11.270 --> 19:17.670]  know how to get rid of it. We've got to figure out the cause. What are the causes of your powdery
[19:17.670 --> 19:22.790]  mildew? It is probably something happening in the room. The room is not right. We all think we've
[19:22.790 --> 19:26.870]  built this amazing grow room, but if you put monitors in there, if you put equipment in there
[19:26.870 --> 19:31.190]  to tell you that everything is accurate and things are the way you need them to be, sometimes that
[19:31.190 --> 19:37.750]  plant is the monitor that tells you something is fucked up. My first assumption, and I know I'm
[19:37.750 --> 19:43.670]  assuming we've got big chances of being wrong, but my assumption is that the VPD, the vapor
[19:43.670 --> 19:49.990]  pressure deficit, is off in this room. It is probably too moist. There's probably some stagnant
[19:49.990 --> 19:56.150]  air in there, probably lacking circulation, which will create what is known as a microclimate.
[19:56.150 --> 20:01.030]  You may have a fan blowing right here, but over here in this area, there are a couple of leaves
[20:01.030 --> 20:05.030]  that have started touching each other and the lights just shining just right in there to make
[20:05.030 --> 20:08.870]  a hot spot and those leaves are touching. They create some moisture. This fan doesn't give a
[20:08.870 --> 20:13.030]  shit about those leaves over there. It's blocked by all these other leaves. Microclimate happening
[20:13.030 --> 20:19.350]  over there, problems can ensue. We've got microclimates. We've got an off VPD. There's
[20:19.350 --> 20:25.030]  also moisture, too much moisture in the room. Is that moisture being caused by the plants? Are they
[20:25.030 --> 20:30.390]  respirating enough moisture to cause too much humidity in that room? Are you over watering?
[20:30.390 --> 20:34.950]  Are you watering just right, but you don't have enough extraction to evacuate the humidity from
[20:34.950 --> 20:40.230]  the room? Do you not have a dehumidifier? There are a lot of things that can contribute to this.
[20:40.230 --> 20:46.310]  So the first thing we need to do is fix the room. The room is probably the cause of the powdery
[20:46.310 --> 20:51.110]  mildew. We need to get the VPD dialed in. We need to get some monitors. We need to see what the
[20:51.110 --> 20:55.990]  temperature is. We need to see what the humidity is. We need to find out if there are temperature
[20:55.990 --> 21:01.270]  and or humidity spikes when the lights go off and when the lights come on, because that is mainly
[21:01.270 --> 21:06.790]  when you're going to see a giant humidity spike. Those spikes are what caused the powdery mildew.
[21:07.430 --> 21:12.950]  Also, I just thought of this. It's not even on my notes. Major shifts in day and night temperature
[21:12.950 --> 21:19.110]  will contribute to your powdery mildew issues. You don't want it to be more than five to 10 degrees
[21:19.110 --> 21:23.670]  cooler in the night cycle than it is in the day cycle. So when those lights shut off,
[21:23.670 --> 21:28.950]  you don't want it to get any more than 10 degrees cooler. We also don't want the humidity to spike
[21:28.950 --> 21:34.790]  or drop any more than five or 10% in the same situation. So we need to get the room dialed in.
[21:34.790 --> 21:38.950]  We need some monitors. We need to know what's happening at all times in that room. Of course,
[21:38.950 --> 21:43.910]  I recommend the PL Minder unit from our friends at PL Grow. They make great equipment. You can
[21:43.910 --> 21:49.510]  open it up on your phone and you can see what the VPD is in your grow room at all times. Is it too
[21:49.510 --> 21:54.550]  hot? Is it too cold? Is it too wet? Is it too dry? It will also give you a warning of some equipment
[21:54.550 --> 21:58.630]  fail because it'll get too warm. It'll beep. It'll say, hey bro, it's getting kind of hot in here.
[21:58.630 --> 22:02.630]  And you can either drive home or go to the grow, figure it out, have somebody at the grow,
[22:02.630 --> 22:06.710]  go in there and figure out why is this room getting too humid or getting too hot? It's a
[22:06.710 --> 22:11.670]  nice fail safe piece of technology. So I recommend some equipment in the grow room to let us know
[22:11.670 --> 22:15.990]  what is going on. It's a little bit late for that because the plants have already told you
[22:15.990 --> 22:20.390]  there's a fucking problem. So now we have got to treat the powdery mildew. It is too late to do
[22:20.390 --> 22:24.790]  preventative. It's too late to dial in the room. It's not too late. Now you have to dial in the
[22:24.790 --> 22:29.110]  room or you're just going to keep getting PM. So figure out what is causing it. Probably too much
[22:29.110 --> 22:34.150]  humidity, stagnant air, not enough airflow, but now let's treat for powdery mildew. This is going
[22:34.150 --> 22:40.070]  to be effective in the veg state or later into flower. A lot of people refuse to spray something
[22:40.070 --> 22:45.030]  in the flower stage, but at this point, if you've got a heavy powdery mildew infestation,
[22:45.030 --> 22:49.590]  you've got the option of having powdery mildew or applying a couple of products. I think the
[22:49.590 --> 22:54.390]  products I recommend you will learn and you will feel safe applying these. So let's talk about how
[22:54.390 --> 23:00.710]  we are going to treat your powdery mildew on your cannabis plants. The first thing we want to do is
[23:00.710 --> 23:05.830]  the first thing is wear gloves. And if it is really, really bad, if the powdery mildew is thick
[23:05.830 --> 23:10.070]  in there, you may want some kind of a mask, maybe a respirator. You don't want to breathe in those
[23:10.070 --> 23:15.430]  powdery mildew spores. I've been exposed to a bunch of powdery mildew in several grows. It will
[23:15.430 --> 23:19.030]  give you a headache. It'll make your lungs burn. It'll make your throat hurt. It'll make you feel
[23:19.030 --> 23:24.310]  generally lethargic for a couple of days. If you get exposed to too much powdery mildew spores,
[23:24.310 --> 23:29.350]  I don't know the technical words for it. We all felt like shit. Some of us had a bloody nose
[23:29.350 --> 23:33.590]  from being in a grow that was just fucking tainted with powdery mildew. We were trying to
[23:33.590 --> 23:38.790]  rescue it. We decided to give up that grow. That job was not for us. That's part of consulting. But
[23:39.670 --> 23:44.390]  we can get rid of powdery mildew. Wear your protective equipment. Wear some gloves. Wear a
[23:44.390 --> 23:48.870]  respirator. Wear a mask. Maybe even wear some goggles. If it's that bad in there, you might
[23:48.870 --> 23:54.230]  want to cover your eyes. The first thing we are going to do is we are going to heavily defoliate
[23:54.230 --> 23:58.950]  these plants. Preventative defoliation would have helped you prevent getting powdery mildew. This is
[23:58.950 --> 24:04.470]  why I talk about defoliating so heavily, not just in commercial grows, but in personal grows. If
[24:04.470 --> 24:08.550]  those leaves weren't there, there wouldn't have been opportunities for powdery mildew to develop
[24:08.550 --> 24:12.470]  on those leaves. Also, if those leaves weren't there, they wouldn't have been respirating and
[24:12.470 --> 24:17.030]  transpiring enough moisture to cause a powdery mildew issue in the room that would have helped
[24:17.030 --> 24:22.390]  mitigate that problem. So let's defoliate. All of the bigger leaves in the room need to be removed.
[24:22.390 --> 24:27.190]  If they've got powdery mildew on there, let's get rid of those leaves immediately. There are
[24:27.190 --> 24:31.430]  different size leaves on your plants. You've got the leaves that are close to the buds, and then
[24:31.430 --> 24:37.350]  we've got those leaves with a long petiole sticking off of the plant. So you've got a long branch and
[24:37.350 --> 24:41.750]  then a big fat leaf. If you've got those long branches coming off, let's take that leaf right
[24:41.750 --> 24:46.310]  off. If the petiole has turned purple, that is definitely time for it to go. That is when I
[24:46.310 --> 24:51.830]  determine that leaf can go. So let's remove all of the big leaves. Anything with powdery mildew needs
[24:51.830 --> 24:56.150]  to go. If it's small and it's up against the bud, we can leave that because we're going to apply a
[24:56.150 --> 25:03.270]  spray to that. We'll remove that next. Let's defoliate. Semi-heavy defoliation, maybe a heavy
[25:03.270 --> 25:08.150]  defoliation depending on the infestation and how bad the powdery mildew is. Let's go in there and
[25:08.150 --> 25:12.870]  pull off leaves. This will do a couple of things. This will get rid of the powdery mildew that is
[25:12.870 --> 25:18.390]  there and slow it from spreading. This will also slow the respiration and transpiration of the
[25:18.390 --> 25:23.350]  plants, and it will slow the humidity and the spread of the powdery mildew. Also, you're just
[25:23.350 --> 25:27.430]  taking some of it out of there. It's going bye-bye. You're throwing the problem in the trash.
[25:27.430 --> 25:35.270]  So let's defoliate. Then here is where we get to the spraying portion of treating for powdery
[25:35.270 --> 25:40.630]  mildew. Hopefully we're in veg. You can spray heavily in veg. If you're in flower, you need to
[25:40.630 --> 25:48.230]  use caution. You can still spray 30% hydrogen peroxide or, don't use them both you guys,
[25:48.230 --> 25:55.510]  30% hydrogen peroxide or a product called Xerotol can be applied to your flowering or
[25:55.510 --> 26:01.670]  vegging plants to help get rid of powdery mildew. These are the first two products I will go for.
[26:01.670 --> 26:08.950]  The 30% hydrogen peroxide may not be available. The Xerotol may not be available. You can find
[26:08.950 --> 26:13.590]  one or the other wherever you are. One of the grocery stores or some sort of supply store will
[26:13.590 --> 26:21.990]  have one or the other in your area. I apply those at 45. I start with 30 milliliters per gallon. If
[26:21.990 --> 26:30.150]  my problem is pretty radical, we will go up to 45 milliliters per gallon of Xerotol or hydrogen
[26:30.150 --> 26:37.190]  peroxide, maybe 50, maybe 60 if that problem is fucking crazy. Start at 30 mils per gallon,
[26:37.190 --> 26:44.310]  30 milliliters per gallon of water of Xerotol or hydrogen peroxide and just spray that all over
[26:44.310 --> 26:49.430]  the plants. If you're in veg, spray it heavily. Wash that powdery mildew off of there. You can
[26:49.430 --> 26:53.910]  spray the plants and watch the mist hit the fucking plant and you can watch that powdery
[26:53.910 --> 26:59.110]  mildew run down the plants. Keep spraying. If you're in veg, there is no risk, no trouble of
[26:59.110 --> 27:03.350]  just fucking spraying the shit out of them. They've already got powdery mildew. You're not
[27:03.350 --> 27:08.150]  going to get bud rot. You're not going to cause problems. We're in here spraying this hydrogen
[27:08.150 --> 27:13.670]  peroxide or the Xerotol. You will smell the cleanliness happening. Here I go again with
[27:13.670 --> 27:21.030]  my safety talk. When you are applying Xerotol or hydrogen peroxide, abso-fucking-lutely wear
[27:21.030 --> 27:26.950]  personal protective equipment. You need gloves when you are mixing the Xerotol and hydrogen
[27:26.950 --> 27:33.670]  peroxide. You need goggles while you are mixing and applying the Xerotol and or hydrogen peroxide.
[27:33.670 --> 27:38.310]  You need a respirator. Think about this. You are applying a product that will kill a powdery
[27:38.310 --> 27:43.590]  mildew that will kill a lot of things. You are applying it with a sprayer. You're making bubbles
[27:43.590 --> 27:48.950]  in the air. If you're using a sprayer that makes very small bubbles, you're breathing those in if
[27:48.950 --> 27:54.390]  you don't have a respirator over your face. You don't want to breathe in bubbles that destroy
[27:54.390 --> 27:59.110]  microbes and destroy mildews because that's going to damage your lungs. It's going to destroy good
[27:59.110 --> 28:03.830]  things inside of your body. We don't want to do that. It is semi-caustic. I think that is the
[28:03.830 --> 28:08.710]  appropriate word. And it will fuck you up. That's the bottom line. It will fuck you up. Wear your
[28:08.710 --> 28:15.430]  personal protective equipment, please. If you get hurt spraying peroxide or Xerotol, remember Rasta
[28:15.430 --> 28:20.710]  Jeff said so many times, wear that personal protective equipment. We cannot be held liable.
[28:20.710 --> 28:26.390]  I am not liable. You got to wear your shit. Even the company that sold you the bottles is not liable
[28:26.390 --> 28:29.910]  because they printed on the bottle, not our fucking fault if you don't wear the shit because
[28:29.910 --> 28:36.230]  you're dumb. So wear the personal protective equipment when mixing and applying the Xerotol
[28:36.230 --> 28:40.470]  and hydrogen peroxide. Also stay out of that room for a couple of hours after you spray it as well.
[28:40.470 --> 28:45.190]  You don't need to be in there touching that shit, getting that stuff on your skin. It is bad for
[28:45.190 --> 28:51.190]  your skin. Where am I here? The smallest bubbles are the best. Like I just said a moment ago over
[28:51.190 --> 28:56.710]  spraying, very small bubbles. You want micro bubbles. If you can use a fogger, do that. I'm
[28:56.710 --> 29:01.910]  not sure if an ionizer, an atomizer is what we want, but I do prefer the smallest bubbles possible.
[29:01.910 --> 29:07.510]  That's how we know we get the most coverage. Now we're going to spray Xerotol and or hydrogen
[29:07.510 --> 29:14.230]  peroxide. If those products don't work, I said you could beef it up to about 50, maybe 60 milliliters
[29:14.230 --> 29:18.950]  per gallon, but that may begin to burn your plants. If you go any higher than that, you're running the
[29:18.950 --> 29:24.150]  risk of messing up your garden. So be careful. Test that on one or two plants before you go hard.
[29:24.150 --> 29:28.950]  There are a couple of other products I can recommend to help mitigate the problems of
[29:28.950 --> 29:33.990]  powdery mildew. These products are called CEASE and Double Nickel. I'll say CEASE again because
[29:33.990 --> 29:40.870]  I said that really heavily. I apologize. CEASE, C-E-A-S-E and Double Nickel are great products we
[29:40.870 --> 29:46.790]  can use to get rid of powdery mildew. We can use them early into flower. Once you're later in flower
[29:46.790 --> 29:51.590]  and have some buds, I would kind of hold off on the CEASE and Double Nickel and go extra hard on
[29:51.590 --> 29:57.110]  the Xerotol and hydrogen peroxide. Those two products, the Xerotol and hydrogen peroxide,
[29:57.110 --> 30:02.550]  they dissipate and evaporate very quickly, but they eat and destroy powdery mildew on contact.
[30:02.550 --> 30:07.830]  So hose it down with that. Now let's talk about the CEASE and Double Nickel. I recommend both of
[30:07.830 --> 30:14.630]  those products again at 45 milliliters per gallon of water. You can use them individually or you can
[30:14.630 --> 30:19.910]  use them together. You can also use them in conjunction with the Xerotol. Let's talk about
[30:19.910 --> 30:29.270]  that. It is okay to use Xerotol and CEASE, but you cannot use Xerotol and Double Nickel. The way I
[30:29.270 --> 30:37.910]  remember that is no nickel. Xerotol and no nickel. The reason for that is the Xerotol will destroy
[30:37.910 --> 30:42.950]  the beneficial bacteria inside of the Double Nickel and render it useless. So when you apply
[30:42.950 --> 30:49.910]  it to the plants, you're basically just applying an inert dead product and Xerotol. So you can use
[30:49.910 --> 30:58.230]  45 milliliters of CEASE and 30 milliliters of Xerotol together, but you cannot use,
[30:58.230 --> 31:05.270]  can not, do not use Xerotol and Double Nickel together. I really hope I said and made that
[31:05.270 --> 31:13.510]  clear. You can use Xerotol and CEASE. You can use CEASE and Double Nickel, but you cannot use
[31:13.510 --> 31:19.510]  Xerotol and Double Nickel. Xerotol kills Double Nickel is the way that works. It makes it a waste
[31:19.510 --> 31:25.350]  of your money. So you can mix up multiple products and you can apply those to your plants. I would
[31:25.350 --> 31:31.750]  spray twice a week to start off. See if that is working for you. My main routine, my preventative
[31:31.750 --> 31:38.870]  sprays are to spray Monday and Thursday. If we see a problem, we definitely add one, maybe two more
[31:38.870 --> 31:43.750]  sprays to the week. We will spray every other day. If we see something popping up in a commercial
[31:43.750 --> 31:48.630]  cultivation facility, I cannot fuck around. I cannot let a problem get out of control.
[31:48.630 --> 31:53.430]  As soon as we see it, we begin treating it. And you should do the same in any grow. If it's your
[31:53.430 --> 31:57.830]  personal grow, your commercial grow, get on it because if you don't get on it, it will get away
[31:57.830 --> 32:04.870]  from you very, very quickly. I'm going to recap again. Please make sure to wear your personal
[32:04.870 --> 32:09.750]  protective equipment. Another very important thing, when you apply anything to the plants,
[32:09.750 --> 32:15.190]  if it's a pesticide, if it's a boost spray, whatever you're spraying in there, write it down.
[32:15.190 --> 32:20.790]  That way, I just said spray every three days. You're stoned, bro. I'm stoned too. You're probably
[32:20.790 --> 32:24.790]  going to forget the last time you sprayed. Write that shit down. It is real easy. You could take
[32:24.790 --> 32:30.470]  a note in your phone. You can tell Siri to make a note. Hey Siri, make a note that I sprayed the
[32:30.470 --> 32:36.550]  plants today at 3.30. Siri will do that shit for you. Make a note of it. That way there is record,
[32:36.550 --> 32:42.470]  document that those plants have been sprayed and when they were sprayed. You guys hear Siri talking
[32:42.470 --> 32:46.070]  to me? I woke Siri up. She's saying some shit. I'm not even going to edit that out. That was
[32:46.070 --> 32:51.750]  fucking funny. Shout out to Siri for always helping us out. She probably wrote that note that I said
[32:51.750 --> 32:55.910]  to write too. That's fucking funny. You guys wear personal protective equipment. Write down your
[32:55.910 --> 33:01.190]  sprays. Spray twice a week. If you need to, step up your sprays. Pay attention to the plants.
[33:01.190 --> 33:06.550]  You may, by spraying a lot, you may start doing damage to the plants, but how much damage is that
[33:06.550 --> 33:11.510]  powdery mildew doing to your plants? We do not want to consume powdery mildew. We don't want to
[33:11.510 --> 33:16.230]  smoke it. We don't want to consume it. We don't want to extract it. It is bad for your lungs. It
[33:16.230 --> 33:20.230]  is bad for your patients. It's bad for your customers. It's bad for business. So let's get
[33:20.230 --> 33:25.830]  rid of that shit. Now, here are a couple of other things we should talk about. If you are working in
[33:25.830 --> 33:30.870]  a grow that has powdery mildew, always sanitize. Even if you don't have powdery mildew, this is
[33:30.870 --> 33:36.070]  basic general practice. Always sanitize your scissors and your tools. When you are done
[33:36.070 --> 33:41.430]  working, if you're working on a group of plants, I try to do it by a strain or a table. After
[33:41.430 --> 33:46.230]  this table, if I've got two strains on the table, I'll do it after all I do the tangies. Now, clean
[33:46.230 --> 33:50.950]  the scissors. Now, after I do all of the blueberries, clean the scissors again. That way, I don't move
[33:50.950 --> 33:56.710]  anything from one strain to another, from one table to another, just because shit does happen.
[33:56.710 --> 34:01.670]  And in a commercial environment, things can get out of control quite quickly. And I've got quite a bit
[34:01.670 --> 34:06.630]  of an investment on the line, and it's not my money. So we've really got to treat things. The
[34:06.630 --> 34:11.590]  minute we see them, we've got to be very careful. We've got to be preventative. So clean your
[34:11.590 --> 34:17.030]  scissors, clean your tools, try to have dedicated grow room clothing. I don't wear these clothes in
[34:17.030 --> 34:21.110]  the grow. I've got specific clothes that I'll throw on and go in the grow. And as I come out,
[34:21.110 --> 34:24.710]  I'll just throw them in a certain spot in the bedroom or wherever, and then I'll change clothes
[34:24.710 --> 34:28.950]  and put these in there. And so those are always, there's one spot in the bedroom that's got dirty
[34:28.950 --> 34:32.870]  clothes that are for the grow, and one spot that's got fresh clothes for the day. Just right where I
[34:32.870 --> 34:36.150]  change clothes normally, they're just right there chilling. So I just swap in and out of them.
[34:36.150 --> 34:41.510]  It doesn't take that long. Have special clothes. When you are in the grow, it is important to
[34:41.510 --> 34:47.590]  protect yourself. I recommend you always wear long sleeves and gloves in the grow. The lights are,
[34:47.590 --> 34:51.510]  they can't be good for you. No matter what kind of lights you're using, they can't be good for
[34:51.510 --> 34:55.270]  your skin. I don't want you to get skin cancer. I don't want you to get any problems with your
[34:55.270 --> 35:00.150]  body from being exposed to grow lights. I wear long sleeves in the grow most of the time. Also,
[35:00.150 --> 35:06.310]  that keeps me protected from pesticide exposure. We've sprayed, in this case, we sprayed cease and
[35:06.310 --> 35:10.550]  double nickel and whatever else we're going to spray. We don't want to get that stuff on our
[35:10.550 --> 35:15.110]  skin. So wear long sleeves. When you rub up against the plants, it's just rubbing up on your shirt.
[35:15.110 --> 35:19.670]  You don't get a pesticide exposure. Also, a lot of people are just straight up allergic to cannabis
[35:19.670 --> 35:23.670]  plants. They'll get a rash. Also, you don't want to be all fucking sticky all day from rubbing up
[35:23.670 --> 35:28.550]  on the plants. Some people like it. Some people don't want it. Wear your gloves. It's good to have
[35:28.550 --> 35:34.150]  gloves on. Again, touching the plants, they've got pesticides on them. Everything in that grow
[35:34.150 --> 35:39.030]  has been hit with a pesticide once you've sprayed. So everywhere you touch is a pesticide zone.
[35:39.030 --> 35:42.710]  If you've got a face itch, if your eye itches, if you've got a booger in your nose, you don't need
[35:42.710 --> 35:46.790]  to rub it with your hand that's got pesticides on it. Pull off your glove, scratch your eye,
[35:46.790 --> 35:50.950]  pick the booger, get that hair out of your mouth, whatever's going on, take a drink of your sody,
[35:50.950 --> 35:55.990]  put on a couple of gloves and go back to it. You don't need to touch your face with contaminated
[35:55.990 --> 36:00.790]  gloves. You don't need to get pesticides on your hands. Let's think about grow room safety.
[36:00.790 --> 36:04.470]  Let's live for a long time and take good care of ourselves. We thrive to take good care of these
[36:04.470 --> 36:09.510]  plants. The plants want to take good care of us. We should take care of ourselves while we are at
[36:09.510 --> 36:14.550]  it. All right. Also, while you are spraying, I'm going to say this one last time, when you are
[36:14.550 --> 36:20.630]  spraying, please protect yourself with goggles, gloves, the appropriate personal protective
[36:20.630 --> 36:25.430]  equipment, clothing, and gloves. Just take care of yourselves. Guys, I don't want you to get hurt
[36:25.430 --> 36:30.870]  doing something that I taught you to do. I've got to cover my ass. You cover your ass and your body,
[36:30.870 --> 36:36.150]  your eyes, your face, and your hands. All right. I hope I taught you a lot about treating powdery
[36:36.150 --> 36:42.070]  mildew. Don't use the neem oil. I recommend Xerotol or 30% hydrogen peroxide, not the stuff
[36:42.070 --> 36:46.870]  that you get at Walmart, not the stuff from Walgreens. You need the good potent 30% hydrogen
[36:46.870 --> 36:53.910]  peroxide. Spray those at about 30 to 50 milliliters per gallon, one or the other. Don't mix those.
[36:53.910 --> 37:00.790]  If you want to buy a commercial grade fungicide, I recommend Cease and Double Nickel. Again,
[37:00.790 --> 37:07.910]  it is okay to Cease and Xerotol. It is not okay to Xerotol and Double Nickel. Always wear your
[37:07.910 --> 37:13.190]  personal protective equipment. All right. I think that covers the powdery mildew question. I want to
[37:13.190 --> 37:17.910]  thank you for the great question, and I want to thank you for the Patreon contribution. Big shout
