[02:41.160 --> 02:45.960]  dude, but we are working on putting together some prizes for episode 50. We're going to
[02:45.960 --> 02:50.520]  hang out in a day or two and that's going to be our priority of the conversation. Excuse
[02:50.520 --> 02:53.840]  my sniffles. We'll talk a little bit about my sniffles here in a little bit. I saw the
[02:53.840 --> 02:57.200]  string cheese incident for three nights in Denver and I may have gotten a little bit
[02:57.200 --> 03:02.480]  sniffly during that minus 16 night. This podcast is also brought to you by our good friends
[03:02.480 --> 03:07.160]  at TreeThugger.com. This episode is brought to you. I just read that part, huh? TreeThugger.com,

[03:17.600 --> 03:20.880]  Big shout out, much love to both or all three of the sponsors. I'm high and stumbling. I
[03:20.880 --> 03:24.320]  got to get my rhythm in this episode. All right. So I want to give a big shout out to
[03:24.320 --> 03:27.280]  the Mystic Roots Band. The song you heard at the opening of the show was called the
[03:27.280 --> 03:31.120]  Doggy Dub from our good friends, the Mystic Roots. Shout out to Cat and Coot. I hope you
[03:31.120 --> 03:34.920]  guys had a great new year. I hope everybody had a great new year. I was talking about
[03:34.920 --> 03:38.800]  going to see the string cheese incident. So we'll talk about that a little bit. I got
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.500]  to go see, if you don't know about the string cheese, they're a jam band from Colorado.
[03:43.500 --> 03:47.120]  They're from the Boulder Estes Park area. They're from all over the place up there.
[03:47.120 --> 03:51.280]  You can't pick one place to say, but that's where they're from is that kind of area. They
[03:51.280 --> 03:54.920]  started off as kind of a bluegrassy jam band. Now they're kind of a more of a psychedelic
[03:54.920 --> 03:59.520]  dubstep jam band. They've got two drummers or they've got a drummer and a guy that plays
[03:59.520 --> 04:03.520]  percussion. They've got a keyboard player that tears it up. They've got an electric
[04:03.520 --> 04:08.240]  guitar player who plays fiddle and electric guitar and mandolin like a champ. Bill Nershy
[04:08.240 --> 04:14.760]  plays acoustic guitar. And then their bass player is, he's solid, dude. He doesn't like
[04:14.880 --> 04:18.560]  stand out. He's not super flashy, but he never missed a note in three nights. So the string
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.480]  cheese incident, they play, the only way I can describe it, dude, is carnival music.
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.280]  It's Calypso music. It's Mambo music. It's Samba. It's rock. It's funk. It's reggae,
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.320]  but it's like one giant carnival. The whole party, the whole concert was one giant carnival.
[04:31.320 --> 04:35.280]  It was a great time. So we saw string cheese incident. They did three nights at the first
[04:35.280 --> 04:39.800]  bank center in Broomfield. So we drove up to, it was actually in West
[04:39.800 --> 04:43.640]  Minster is where our hotel was. So we drove up to the hotel. We stayed in the hotel. We
[04:44.040 --> 04:48.280]  went and saw the first show. And after the first set, they do three nights. And the first
[04:48.280 --> 04:52.040]  night they played for about an hour and 15, took a break and then came out for about another
[04:52.040 --> 04:57.720]  hour and a half and tore that night up. After the first set of the first night, I said,
[04:57.720 --> 05:00.760]  where are they going to go from here? Cause they came out and they just tore it up right
[05:00.760 --> 05:04.960]  off the bat. They didn't start like, let's start slow and build it up. No, they started
[05:04.960 --> 05:09.640]  like let's come out on fire and just fuck this all up. And they did it. It was amazing.
[05:09.640 --> 05:14.160]  So a big thanks to the string cheese incident. That was awesome. So day two, or we finished
[05:14.160 --> 05:18.160]  the show night one, went back to the hotel. We're beat. We pretty much slept day two.
[05:18.160 --> 05:22.560]  We kind of just hung out in the hotel and we're lazy. It was cold. It was a minus 16
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.620]  degrees that day. And there was no real reason to leave the hotel other than to get food.
[05:27.620 --> 05:31.320]  We had dabs and drinks and everything we needed. So we just hung out in the hotel until time
[05:31.320 --> 05:36.240]  for the show. The second night was amazing. We'd pretty much, we ditched the shows at
[05:36.240 --> 05:39.720]  the end and head right back to the hotel. We're not real party animals anymore. I don't
[05:39.720 --> 05:42.760]  need to eat a bunch of drugs and get spun out. I wanted to go home and get prepared
[05:42.760 --> 05:47.060]  for the next day. Cause new year's was a big party. Um, they started a little bit early
[05:47.060 --> 05:53.460]  and they played until about one 45. If I remember correctly, they started at eight 45 and went
[05:53.460 --> 06:00.840]  to one 45 with a couple of breaks, uh, string cheese incident on new year's.
[06:00.840 --> 06:05.200]  I've never seen so much confetti, so many balloons. I can't even begin to describe what
[06:05.200 --> 06:09.680]  it was like. We were me and my girlfriend, Angela were in the front three rows, uh, right
[06:09.680 --> 06:13.640]  in front of bill Nershy and kind of off to the side from Kyle. So there's a huge party
[06:13.640 --> 06:17.800]  right there. And after the first or second night, everybody knew who we were. So everyone
[06:17.800 --> 06:20.840]  just treated us like friends and family. So big shout out to all the new friends and family
[06:20.840 --> 06:24.440]  that I made from the string cheese incident. But man, they had these giant, uh, they look
[06:24.440 --> 06:27.600]  like cocoons hanging from the ceiling when we walked in that night and you couldn't identify
[06:27.600 --> 06:32.800]  what they were. But as the midnight countdown began, these cocoons opened up and there were,
[06:32.800 --> 06:37.640]  they became giant flowers that were lit up and it was pretty amazing. I posted video
[06:37.640 --> 06:41.400]  on my Facebook. Uh, if you guys want to check that out, you'll have to find my personal
[06:41.400 --> 06:44.760]  Facebook. I shouldn't have said that, but there are a lot of cool videos of it. Check
[06:44.760 --> 06:49.440]  it out. It was amazing. I was covered in confetti. There were so many balloons. So big thanks
[06:49.440 --> 06:55.040]  to Angela for letting me go, uh, inviting me to be your new year's buddy. And also for
[06:55.040 --> 06:59.320]  thanks for that sweet new year's kiss, babe. We needed that. It meant a lot to me. Um,
[06:59.320 --> 07:02.440]  let's see big thanks to all the cheese kids and fans that I made. I made a list here.
[07:03.080 --> 07:05.200]  I'm going to try to get some of these people in here. I'm going to skip a bunch though.
[07:05.200 --> 07:10.320]  Big thanks to Pam and Jessica. Um, I met Pam for the first time. Angela speaks very highly
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.440]  of you. And now I see why, uh, Jessica, I just met that night had never heard of her.
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.120]  Uh, she's a big ball of smiley energy. It was great to meet you and hang out with you.
[07:18.120 --> 07:21.800]  Uh, big thanks to mama Cass. Uh, it was great meeting you. Nice lady that calls herself
[07:21.800 --> 07:25.440]  mama cash. She had a lot of great energy, had a lot of good things to say. A big thanks
[07:25.440 --> 07:29.040]  to the guy with the amazing candy. I cannot remember your name. Uh, the student next to
[07:29.040 --> 07:35.400]  me offered me a lemon, excuse me. He offered me a lemon candy. And, uh, I said, is it
[07:35.400 --> 07:39.200]  just candy? And he said, yeah, man, my thing is to just bring weird candies to the show
[07:39.200 --> 07:42.520]  and they're delicious. And so I took this lemon candy from him and it was amazing. And
[07:42.520 --> 07:46.040]  later on in the show, he offered me something. And when he pulled it out of his pocket, the
[07:46.040 --> 07:49.640]  guy next to him, patted me on the shoulder and said, eat one of those, man. And when
[07:49.640 --> 07:55.120]  I tried it, it was amazing. It was some, uh, all the, uh, packaging was in another language.
[07:55.120 --> 07:57.920]  It's like Chinese or Korean or something. I'm sorry if that's offensive. I don't know
[07:57.920 --> 08:02.360]  what fucking language it is. It looks Chinese to me. And, um, it was mango flavored and
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.920]  whatever I ate was amazing, dude. And it did not have drugs in it. So I was pretty relieved
[08:05.920 --> 08:10.940]  about an hour later when I wasn't flipping my face off. So a big shot to the candy guy.
[08:10.940 --> 08:16.040]  Also a big shout out to Dan, Karin, Roland, and Riley. It was a pleasure meeting all of
[08:16.040 --> 08:19.760]  my new friends. Uh, you guys are great, great little family. You guys have there also a
[08:19.760 --> 08:24.120]  shout out to the girl that we named titty girl. Um, I never met her. We never met her,
[08:24.120 --> 08:28.600]  but her boobs and her vibes were amazing and fun to watch. Uh, she was so exposed that
[08:28.600 --> 08:32.360]  my girlfriend told me to look because it was ridiculous. She said, look to your left, that
[08:32.360 --> 08:37.360]  girl's boobs are out of her shirt. And I looked and it was, it wasn't even like I was looking
[08:37.360 --> 08:40.800]  to be a pervert. I was more looking like, is she really having her tits out of her shirt
[08:40.800 --> 08:45.000]  that much at the show? It was kind of entertaining, kind of ridiculous. So big shout out to titty
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.760]  girl. She was a good dancer. She had a lot of good energy. She brought a little crew
[08:47.760 --> 08:51.320]  of chicks with her that, uh, twirled around and brought a nice little vibe. So that was
[08:51.320 --> 08:56.320]  neat. Dude, some of the girls at the show, uh, they wear this eye makeup with beads in
[08:56.320 --> 09:01.120]  it, dude. And I don't understand how you ladies do that stuff. Uh, you got like, I'm serious,
[09:01.120 --> 09:04.440]  like right in the corner of your eye where you wake up with eye crusties on the outside,
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.320]  not near your nose, but the other side, they've got little beads and shit there. Um, I don't
[09:08.320 --> 09:11.800]  understand how ladies tolerate that shit all night on your face, but I do however, think
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.140]  it's cute. And I totally appreciate the effort. Uh, but it does make me, make me be extra
[09:17.140 --> 09:21.940]  glad to be the guy with dreadlocks. I wake up, uh, sometimes I take a shower occasionally.
[09:21.940 --> 09:26.100]  I mostly wake up, put on some clothes, throw on a t-shirt, shake my head and put on a hat
[09:26.100 --> 09:30.340]  and I'm ready to rock. You can't tell if I just woke up or if I've been working all day.
[09:30.340 --> 09:34.180]  So it makes me extra grateful to be a guy that can be lazy, but also thank you ladies
[09:34.180 --> 09:38.540]  for looking great at the cheese show, Angela. Thank you for looking wonderful. Uh, thanks
[09:38.540 --> 09:41.540]  again for letting me have a good time. Uh, I did mention that I got a little cold, I
[09:41.540 --> 09:45.220]  guess I got some sniffles, bro. I just sniffled right in the mic to do that. And that was
[09:45.220 --> 09:50.620]  weird, but it was minus 16 degrees one night and you got to go from the car into the concert
[09:50.620 --> 09:55.100]  venue and the minus 16. And then in the concert, I just, I took off all my jackets and I had
[09:55.100 --> 10:00.460]  my t-shirt and my pants on and my shoes and my hat and I was sweating my ass off. So you
[10:00.460 --> 10:04.940]  got to try to negotiate the cold and then the super hot heat and then back to the car
[10:04.940 --> 10:09.540]  again and then let the car warm up and get to the hotel. So I think all the climate changes,
[10:09.540 --> 10:14.380]  uh, I may have got a little cold here. And also I smoked like 45 joints over three nights
[10:14.540 --> 10:19.260]  at these concerts where I rolled a bunch of joints. I smoked like 45 joints with strangers.
[10:19.260 --> 10:23.740]  And I'm wondering if maybe I got a little bit of string cheese incident, Wook flu, but
[10:23.740 --> 10:26.860]  whatever, I'll live. I've got some emergency and some yerba mate. I'm going to be just
[10:26.860 --> 10:31.140]  fine. Uh, it was fun meeting a lot of Instagram followers. I met a lot of people. They walked
[10:31.140 --> 10:34.580]  up to me and they said, Hey, are you Irie genetics or are you Rasta Jeff? And that's
[10:34.580 --> 10:38.260]  always kind of nice when you're just out randomly somewhere that, uh, there's a band playing
[10:38.260 --> 10:41.980]  and you're not like, it wasn't a weed event. I shouldn't have been getting any attention,
[10:41.980 --> 10:44.580]  but people knew who I was. It was kind of neat. So big shout out to all those folks
[10:44.580 --> 10:48.740]  that said, hi, I really appreciate that. I'm digging through notes here. Oh, huge shout
[10:48.740 --> 10:54.700]  out to Aaron Brooks on the very last night we were walking out of the venue. Um, and
[10:54.700 --> 10:58.700]  if my girlfriend didn't have to pee, we would not have bumped into each other. So I'm so
[10:58.700 --> 11:01.780]  glad she had to pee. And I bumped into Aaron Brooks and got a big old hug. Aaron Brooks
[11:01.780 --> 11:05.780]  is an artist. If you're not following him, you should be. Uh, let's see. What else do
[11:05.780 --> 11:08.780]  I need to talk about? I wrote down a lot of stuff. I feel like I'm rambling. We're already
[11:08.780 --> 11:13.260]  11 minutes in guys. This is going to be another one of those short quick episodes with just
[11:13.260 --> 11:18.700]  me. Um, I put a lot of work into this podcast, but this week I was obviously busy, uh, seeing
[11:18.700 --> 11:22.060]  the string cheese incident. I've been out of town. I was gone for four days. It took
[11:22.060 --> 11:26.900]  me a whole day to get my gardens back to where I felt they should be. They missed me. And
[11:26.900 --> 11:31.420]  then I needed a day to get myself back together. I tried to record yesterday, but it was chaotic.
[11:31.420 --> 11:34.660]  So here I am. I'm recording this quick short episode because I love you guys. And I don't
[11:34.660 --> 11:39.500]  want to leave you hanging for a whole week, but I do promise that, uh, the next episodes
[11:39.500 --> 11:45.100]  are going to be back to what you expect. 48, 49 and 50 are going to be stellar episodes.
[11:45.100 --> 11:49.340]  I'm hoping to get Spencer on pretty soon, but I never, never teased you about that.
[11:49.340 --> 11:54.060]  Well, let's see. Sorry, I'm choking. I'm gonna take a quick drink here. Take a dab while
[11:54.060 --> 12:03.600]  I take a drink. Oh, shout out to water and root beer. And those things keep me alive.
[12:03.600 --> 12:07.600]  So, uh, remind you guys of the name change. That's my next note. I'm sure you noticed
[12:07.600 --> 12:11.360]  at the beginning of the show that I said, welcome to the I grow culture podcast. I'm
[12:11.360 --> 12:17.460]  doing my best to roll out the new name. Uh, I'm doing it slowly so I don't lose people.
[12:17.460 --> 12:20.200]  So if it looks confusing for a little bit, I'm sure you guys are aware of what's going
[12:20.200 --> 12:24.000]  on if you're listening, but we are in the process of changing the name from, I grow
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.400]  culture to grow from your heart. Bear with me. Um, I still could use more logos. Uh,
[12:29.400 --> 12:33.000]  somebody sent me one logo, but I asked for a couple of adjustments. It just, it didn't
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.920]  fit the way I needed it to fit to make a squares out of it. I need a square logo. So
[12:36.920 --> 12:43.560]  if you can send me a 1400 by 1400, uh, pixel image with the grow from your heart podcast,
[12:43.560 --> 12:48.280]  I would love that. Um, I also need a song. If you guys want to, if anybody out there
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.680]  is an artist and you want to make a grow from your heart podcast theme song, I will compensate
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.560]  you in the future. That'd be really cool. So I'm starting to change the title in social
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.120]  media places. Also, I'm waiting on a couple of artists to submit some logos that I've
[13:01.240 --> 13:05.000]  commissioned. And once I've got all the artwork, I can fully roll out the new title and start
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.680]  switching everything over. Um, I'm hoping by episode 50 that we can actually just call
[13:09.680 --> 13:14.280]  this the grow from your heart podcast and everything will be switched right over. Let's
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.160]  see. Also, here's something that I've been considering. This is just a personal thing
[13:19.160 --> 13:26.480]  for myself that I'm considering doing. I may cancel at the Instagram for the podcast. There
[13:26.560 --> 13:33.560]  is an I grow culture podcast Instagram that I haven't posted anything to in several weeks.
[13:35.080 --> 13:38.680]  Honestly, it kind of, it's just a distraction. There's not a lot, it's a podcast and some
[13:38.680 --> 13:43.560]  of my guests don't want me to take their picture. Jesse doesn't want his face on. Um, Adam is
[13:43.560 --> 13:47.720]  cool with it. Mike is cool with it, but some people do not want to be seen. And I feel
[13:47.720 --> 13:52.720]  like I'm just going to overdo my Instagram presence by having the I read genetics and
[13:52.720 --> 13:56.720]  the I grow culture or the grow from your heart podcast. So I'm thinking about just
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.280]  combining the two into one entity and maybe I'll start posting a few things from the grow
[14:02.280 --> 14:07.360]  from your heart podcast on the I region netx Instagram. So if you're not already following
[14:07.360 --> 14:12.560]  I read genetics on Instagram, go there and follow that because I'm really considering
[14:12.560 --> 14:16.600]  taking down the Instagram for the podcast. It's just a distraction. It's one more thing
[14:16.600 --> 14:22.240]  to worry about. Um, I'm also considering and I'm not committing to this, but it's highly
[14:22.280 --> 14:26.680]  likely somebody had to talk with me and it got me thinking, but I'm considering canceling
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.240]  my YouTube account for the, I grow culture, grow from your heart podcast. You'd say, why
[14:31.240 --> 14:37.680]  would you do that? People are listening. They are, but not as many. And I'm not, I appreciate
[14:37.680 --> 14:41.840]  the people that are listening, but it takes me a long time, uh, to get those episodes
[14:41.840 --> 14:45.840]  up there. I feel if I cancel that, I feel I can focus more on the show. And if I didn't
[14:45.840 --> 14:50.520]  have to create as many different types of media, I can make better content just for
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.200]  the audio podcast. I'd rather spend the time creating content instead of editing video
[14:54.200 --> 14:59.080]  and setting up a camera and lighting, uh, and editing the video again, and then rendering
[14:59.080 --> 15:03.120]  the video for YouTube. It, it takes a few minutes, just a few more steps, but all of
[15:03.120 --> 15:08.140]  those steps matter. I could spend that much time preparing for this show and making the
[15:08.140 --> 15:12.200]  show that much better, having that many more details, being that much more prepared, getting
[15:12.200 --> 15:19.040]  that much better of a guest on. So the Instagram and the YouTube may go away and that's just
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.040]  personal things. I'm trying to free up more time to take what I'm really passionate about
[15:23.040 --> 15:27.920]  to the next level. I don't want to drag my feet on things that are not fulfilling me,
[15:27.920 --> 15:32.240]  honestly. So I may eliminate those. And I do appreciate the guys that watch me on YouTube.
[15:32.240 --> 15:37.560]  I've only gotten like 17 or 18, maybe 20 videos up on YouTube because like I said, it takes
[15:37.560 --> 15:41.840]  me an hour to make each one. And I feel like I could, I'm repeating myself. I could just
[15:41.840 --> 15:47.080]  spend that time doing stuff. So I may take them down. I don't, I don't want to abandon
[15:47.080 --> 15:51.400]  people, but if you are watching on YouTube, you should be able to find it on the I Grow
[15:51.400 --> 15:56.960]  Culture or the iReGenetics website. Every podcast is there. And if you've got a browser,
[15:56.960 --> 16:00.880]  it works the same and there's not, you're not missing anything visually really. So those
[16:00.880 --> 16:04.360]  are mostly distractions. I feel like I'm going to stop contributing to those just so that
[16:04.360 --> 16:09.760]  I can improve the audio part of the show. So I feel like I'm talking about that for
[16:09.760 --> 16:14.040]  a long time. I need to move on. Let's see. I appreciate all the emails I've gotten. Holy
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.600]  crap, you guys. We're going to continue to use the I Grow Culture at hotmail.com email
[16:18.600 --> 16:23.980]  address for now. By episode 50, I will have created the new email address and I'll start
[16:23.980 --> 16:28.000]  talking about it and you can email me there. But from now on or for now, keep using the
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.600]  I Grow Culture at hotmail.com email address. I did change the Twitter. It's still at I
[16:32.600 --> 16:37.080]  Grow Culture, but if you look at it, the name is Grow From Your Heart Podcast. It won't
[16:37.080 --> 16:43.680]  let me change my at name, only my display name. So that's something you can pay attention
[16:43.840 --> 16:47.720]  to. Let's see. I wrote a bunch of notes and I have them in my computer and I'm scrolling
[16:47.720 --> 16:51.160]  through the computer and looking at a piece of paper trying to read two things at once
[16:51.160 --> 16:56.680]  and it's honestly not working. So episode 50 is coming up. You guys have been talking
[16:56.680 --> 17:01.120]  about that. I'm planning a small celebration episode, but I would like your input. I asked
[17:01.120 --> 17:05.280]  for this on the last episode, but I want to know who your favorite guests were. What were
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.360]  some of your favorite moments and what did you learn and what would you like to hear
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.480]  next? So like I said, send me some input. It's I Grow Culture at hotmail.com. You can
[17:13.480 --> 17:19.160]  tweet me or you can find me on Facebook. It looks like I need to change the Facebook also,
[17:19.160 --> 17:23.140]  you guys. So it's still I Grow Culture, but pretty soon it's going to be the Grow From
[17:23.140 --> 17:28.560]  Your Heart Podcast on Facebook. All right. I feel like I got, crap, sorry. I feel like
[17:28.560 --> 17:32.520]  I got you guys caught up on all of the stuff I had to remind you of and talk about. So
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.760]  now I think it's time to read a couple of news articles that I picked out for the day.
[17:37.760 --> 17:45.000]  This one says, Colorado seeks federal okay for state colleges to grow pot. A lot of people
[17:45.000 --> 17:49.200]  from out of state are going, what? But it'll make sense. This article is from the Denver
[17:49.200 --> 17:54.240]  Post and it's written by John Engold. It says, Colorado has made an unusual plea to federal
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.800]  authorities. Let our colleges grow pot. In a letter sent last month, the state attorney
[17:58.800 --> 18:03.960]  general's office asks federal health and education officials for permission on Colorado's colleges
[18:03.960 --> 18:09.600]  and universities to obtain marijuana from non-federal government resources for research
[18:09.600 --> 18:14.680]  purposes. The letter isn't more specific on how the state's higher education institutions
[18:14.680 --> 18:20.680]  might score weed, but it was sent pursuant to a law passed in 2014 requiring state officials
[18:20.680 --> 18:25.600]  to ask that Colorado colleges and universities be allowed to cultivate marijuana and its
[18:25.600 --> 18:32.680]  component parts. Current research is riddled with bias or insufficiencies and often conflict
[18:32.680 --> 18:37.200]  with one another, reads the letter written by deputy attorney general David Blake. It
[18:37.200 --> 18:41.600]  is critical that we be allowed to fill the void of scientific research and this may only
[18:41.600 --> 18:47.200]  be done with your assistance and cooperation. The request is not a long shot. While marijuana
[18:47.200 --> 18:52.160]  is with qualifications legal in Colorado, it remains illegal under federal law and getting
[18:52.160 --> 18:57.440]  permission to conduct research on cannabis requires clearing a set of high hurdles. Approval
[18:57.440 --> 19:01.480]  from multiple federal agencies and strict requirements on how marijuana must be handled
[19:01.480 --> 19:06.320]  and stored. Researchers that work without the federal government's blessing risk losing
[19:06.320 --> 19:13.520]  crucial federal funding for their institutions, not to mention possible imprisonment. An international
[19:13.520 --> 19:21.220]  treaty that the United States signed on to requires the federal government to designate
[19:21.220 --> 19:26.520]  only one place in the country that can legally grow marijuana for research. Since 1968, that
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.800]  place has been the University of Mississippi's National Care for Natural Products Research,
[19:31.800 --> 19:37.240]  which cultivates cannabis on a 12 acre plot and sends it to approved researchers. Guys,
[19:37.240 --> 19:42.340]  that 12 acre plot is rumored to be where the G13 came from many years ago out of University
[19:42.340 --> 19:45.640]  of Mississippi. So if you know anything about that, send me some info. I'd like to know
[19:45.640 --> 19:53.080]  about it. All right. The article goes on to say, coincidentally, the National Institute
[19:53.080 --> 19:57.820]  on Drug Abuse recently put the government's pot farm contract up for rebid. Applicants
[19:57.820 --> 20:03.600]  need to have 12 acres of secured and video monitored outdoor space and 1000 feet of indoor
[20:03.600 --> 20:08.560]  space to grow marijuana to be able to make marijuana extractions, test for potency and
[20:08.560 --> 20:13.480]  prepare preferably by hand rolling a small batch of marijuana cigarettes according to
[20:13.480 --> 20:18.560]  the official solicitation. The contract's winner is expected to be announced in the
[20:18.560 --> 20:22.920]  next couple of months. A spokeswoman for the National Institute of Drug Abuse would not
[20:22.920 --> 20:29.480]  say how many institutions applied for the contract or where they were. Spokesman for
[20:29.480 --> 20:34.820]  the University of Colorado and Colorado State University said their schools did not apply.
[20:34.820 --> 20:39.480]  The Drug Enforcement Administration in 2014 massively increased the amount of pot the
[20:39.480 --> 20:46.960]  government's official supplier can grow from 21 kilos to 650 kilos. The increase was the
[20:46.960 --> 20:51.600]  result of a boom in marijuana research interest and the University of Mississippi has pledged
[20:51.720 --> 20:55.680]  to grow new strains of marijuana to give research more options for their studies.
[20:55.680 --> 20:59.480]  It was a long time ago, there was a video out, a movie. I cannot recall the name of
[20:59.480 --> 21:03.600]  the movie. It was something like The Union. It may have been in The Union. It may have
[21:03.600 --> 21:09.520]  been How Weed Won the West, maybe. I can't remember the name of which movie it was, but
[21:09.520 --> 21:14.800]  they actually showed us inside of this facility in Mississippi where they grow this cannabis
[21:14.800 --> 21:20.640]  and it was terrible. They weren't growing high grade cannabis. I bitch about the weed
[21:20.640 --> 21:25.400]  at the dispensaries and I would rather smoke the weed at the dispensaries than the bullshit
[21:25.400 --> 21:31.700]  that I saw being grown at University of Mississippi. That stuff was terrible. It's not really cool
[21:31.700 --> 21:36.300]  that they're doing the research with that. I hope since then they've gotten a real grower
[21:36.300 --> 21:39.200]  and they've gotten some genetics and they've learned a few things because what I saw was
[21:39.200 --> 21:40.200]  shit.
[21:40.200 --> 21:43.800]  We'll continue with the article. It says, still the Colorado Attorney General's letter
[21:43.800 --> 21:47.800]  says the federal government falls short of being able to supply researchers with the
[21:47.800 --> 21:53.000]  kinds of products available in Colorado's commercial marijuana market. State health
[21:53.000 --> 21:59.020]  officials have just approved up to $8.4 million in grants for marijuana studies, some of which
[21:59.020 --> 22:04.320]  will examine Colorado specific products. But the Attorney General's office says more needs
[22:04.320 --> 22:10.700]  to be done. We need the support of our federal partners to overcome the inertia that continues
[22:10.700 --> 22:15.800]  to complicate state efforts in this area, the letter states.
[22:15.800 --> 22:20.760]  It seems like they caught on. They know that we've got the dank here in Colorado. They
[22:20.760 --> 22:25.360]  know that they need to test, excuse me, they know they need to examine Colorado specific
[22:25.360 --> 22:29.200]  products. So maybe they are catching on. Maybe they know that that stuff that they're growing
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.800]  out there at that university is a bunch of mids. Speaking of mids, shout out to my buddy
[22:33.800 --> 22:36.380]  Vigor Lover. I hope you're doing well, bro.
[22:36.380 --> 22:39.480]  So what this says, this article, I want to talk about this a minute. We are actually
[22:39.480 --> 22:46.860]  asking the federal government to let the state colleges or higher educational centers
[22:46.860 --> 22:55.300]  in Colorado to grow cannabis. They want to grow pot. That means there will be courses
[22:55.300 --> 23:01.740]  or a class that is accredited to a college where somebody is growing weed. It's probably
[23:01.740 --> 23:07.140]  going to be a chemistry class or a biology class. It probably won't be a horticulture
[23:07.140 --> 23:11.240]  class because they're not worried about growing it. They're more worried about the effects
[23:11.240 --> 23:16.420]  and science. They know how to grow it. That's horticulture. That's already done. These guys
[23:16.420 --> 23:23.800]  are going to probably have some students making extracts, testing the extracts. I'm not even
[23:23.800 --> 23:26.740]  sure what they're going to do, but I'm impressed and I'm excited. I hope this works because
[23:26.740 --> 23:32.460]  I would love to see cannabis grown in a university and tested here in Colorado where we're not
[23:32.460 --> 23:38.740]  scared and trying to lie about all of the results. To see possibly some of my friends
[23:38.740 --> 23:44.340]  that are college students able to study cannabis in this way in a college and actually get
[23:44.340 --> 23:49.420]  college credit and build a future for themselves, I really like this. I really love that cannabis
[23:49.420 --> 23:56.140]  has opened doors and gone from us hiding to letting us make a living for ourselves. This
[23:56.140 --> 24:01.340]  demographic, this age group of 25 to 40-year-old males, and there are females in there too,
[24:01.420 --> 24:07.740]  but honestly, the majority is males. We were struggling. We were broke. Now the 25 to 40-year-old
[24:07.740 --> 24:12.340]  demographic has something to do with ourselves. We can grow great cannabis and get in the
[24:12.340 --> 24:13.660]  industry. It's great.
[24:13.660 --> 24:18.020]  All right. Here's another news article, guys. I feel like I'm going really fast. Sorry,
[24:18.020 --> 24:21.940]  I'm talking so fast. I've had some yerba mate and I'm drinking a root beer. Maybe I just
[24:21.940 --> 24:26.580]  need to slow down a little bit. We're 25 minutes in. It's going to be a short episode, but
[24:26.580 --> 24:30.980]  I promised you that anyway, so it's okay. I found this article on the cannabis as well.
[24:31.020 --> 24:35.780]  I found it entertaining. It says, it's actually a long article. I only want to read one piece
[24:35.780 --> 24:43.620]  of it to you guys. It says, Cannabis Q&A, Naming Strains and Federal Rescheduling Riddle.
[24:43.620 --> 24:48.740]  The part I want to read about is naming strains. This is from, it's by Susan Squibb on the
[24:48.740 --> 24:54.740]  Cannabis staff. The header is, welcome to our Ask the Cannabis column. Clearly you have
[24:54.740 --> 24:59.980]  questions about marijuana, be it a legal concern, a health curiosity, a Colorado-centric inquiry,
[24:59.980 --> 25:04.920]  or something more far reaching. Check out our expansive 100 question Colorado marijuana
[25:04.920 --> 25:09.020]  frequently asked questions first. If you're still curious, email your questions to the
[25:09.020 --> 25:14.740]  Cannabis at, and then there's askthecannabis.gmail.com. If you want to participate in that, feel free.
[25:14.740 --> 25:19.100]  I get a lot of my new stuff from these guys, so participate with them if you want.
[25:19.100 --> 25:23.500]  The first question got my attention. It says, hey Cannabis, why would someone name a strain
[25:23.500 --> 25:29.260]  of weed after a bioweapon that killed thousands of people? They signed the letter, put off
[25:29.260 --> 25:35.660]  pot. So this guy's asking, why would somebody name a strain of weed after a bioweapon that
[25:35.660 --> 25:39.980]  killed thousands of people? And the Cannabis replies, you must be talking about Agent Orange,
[25:39.980 --> 25:44.620]  huh? I hear your concern. Strain names can mean one thing to a potential customer and
[25:44.620 --> 25:49.020]  something else to a plant breeder naming the strain. While Agent Orange is not a peaceful,
[25:49.020 --> 25:53.860]  happy, or euphoric name, if you view it in historical context, there is the other view
[25:53.860 --> 25:57.620]  that the name suggests an orange scent and the potency is the bomb.
[25:58.500 --> 26:03.460]  An article says, I chatted with Adam Dunn, host of the Adam Dunn Show. Shout out to the Adam Dunn
[26:03.460 --> 26:07.220]  Show. What's up, Mitch? What's up, Adam? What's up, everybody on the show? Crunchy, bike. Hope
[26:07.220 --> 26:11.540]  you guys are all doing well. But Adam is the founder of the Amsterdam-based seed company,
[26:11.540 --> 26:16.980]  TH Seeds. And he says, having owned a seed company myself for 21 years, I can attest that many
[26:16.980 --> 26:22.340]  cannabis seed companies are run by people who have a bit more of a juvenile attitude, especially when
[26:22.340 --> 26:29.780]  it comes to the names game, Dunn says. Names like Agent Orange, AK-47, Green Crack, and Wheelchair
[26:29.780 --> 26:35.540]  Weed, though quite distasteful, conjure up images of something really strong and devastating. I doubt
[26:35.540 --> 26:39.540]  the people who named Agent Orange really considered this was a bioweapon that killed thousands of
[26:39.540 --> 26:47.060]  people and destroyed lives of countless more. Often, strain names are creative combinations
[26:47.060 --> 26:52.180]  of the names that make up the genetic lineage or other plant attributes. Adam Dunn says,
[26:52.180 --> 26:57.700]  having been there at the naming of AK-47 and my own MK Ultra, I am guilty of joining the hype,
[26:57.700 --> 27:04.900]  Dunn says. I was dead wrong back in 1993 when I said AK-47 was a terrible name. It was named
[27:04.900 --> 27:11.220]  for flowering on 47 days, and AK-47 went on to become one of the most famous strains in history.
[27:11.940 --> 27:16.820]  With the start of the legal adult use market this year, the reactions of consumers to strain names
[27:16.820 --> 27:23.540]  is a recent development in marijuana marketing. Dunn points out that the cannabis industry is
[27:23.540 --> 27:29.860]  very young and will go through many changes. So I am guilty of this. This is why it got me
[27:29.860 --> 27:34.980]  attention. I've got a strain called Bounty Killer, and I had a friend named Nancy tell me that she
[27:34.980 --> 27:38.820]  didn't really like the name and she was reluctant to grow it because it was called Bounty Killer.
[27:39.700 --> 27:44.100]  I called it Bounty Killer. Honestly, it's named after one of my favorite reggae artists is named
[27:44.100 --> 27:50.500]  Bounty Killer. I like the way he does things and I wanted to honor him. I've got the Cableton,
[27:50.500 --> 27:55.380]  which is also named after a reggae artist. I've got the Kalonji Kush, which is also named after
[27:55.380 --> 28:02.100]  a reggae artist. The Night Nurse is named after a reggae song. The reason I called Bounty Killer
[28:02.100 --> 28:06.740]  Bounty Killer after the reggae artist is because it grows killer weed. It is killer. It'll kick
[28:06.740 --> 28:12.500]  your ass. It grows huge colas and huge harvests. So that's the bounty there, and it's the Bounty
[28:12.500 --> 28:15.860]  Killer. So if you don't know about reggae, it sounds like you're reaping the bounty. You're
[28:15.860 --> 28:21.060]  killing that huge harvest. Or if you know reggae, you know that it's the Bounty Killer and it's
[28:21.060 --> 28:25.140]  kind of aggressive and kind of loud and it's got a groovy beat to it. And that's why I call it the
[28:25.140 --> 28:30.660]  Bounty Killer. I wanted to talk about why I named things the way I name them and why strains I've
[28:30.660 --> 28:37.540]  created have the names they have. I'm a Grateful Dead fan. I'm a Deadhead. I'm kind of into like
[28:37.540 --> 28:41.220]  the whole spiritual side of life. I'm definitely a Rastafarian. That's why my company is called
[28:41.220 --> 28:47.780]  Iry Genetics. I try to honor the parents, the parent plants that I'm using when I create a new
[28:47.780 --> 28:53.860]  strain, but sometimes that just gets redundant and you can't be creative. So I like to draw from
[28:54.420 --> 29:00.100]  Rasta culture, Grateful Dead culture, and like positive, loving hippie culture. That's why I've
[29:00.100 --> 29:05.300]  got a strain called Heart of Gold. It's the golden goat crossed to the grateful dog. It almost got
[29:05.300 --> 29:11.380]  called horn dog, but that didn't sound as good for the vibe I'm trying to promote. Heart of Gold,
[29:11.380 --> 29:16.180]  when you smoke that weed and you meditate, your heart is calm. Your heart is filled with love.
[29:16.180 --> 29:19.700]  What's better than a heart of gold, right? You got a big heart of gold. That's just pumping love
[29:19.700 --> 29:26.260]  and positive energy and it's got golden goat in it. So it's Heart of Gold. Lemon Jeffrey is golden
[29:26.260 --> 29:34.580]  goat crossed to the lemon skunk. So there's lemon, obviously the lemon, right? And my name is Jeff
[29:34.660 --> 29:40.260]  and I wanted something like you got Aryan's Hayes and there's Neville's Hayes. Why not have a lemon
[29:40.260 --> 29:44.340]  Jeffrey that's named after me, the guy that made it. That was kind of my little stingy move on the
[29:44.340 --> 29:49.380]  cannabis world there. These guys were talking about Agent Orange. I know who made Agent Orange.
[29:49.380 --> 29:53.060]  That was Subcool. It's Orange Velvet. It's an Orange Velvet to Jack the Ripper cross.
[29:53.780 --> 29:57.380]  And I think Agent Orange was a perfect name. And then I just said another name, Jack the Ripper.
[29:58.100 --> 30:02.100]  It's Jack Herrera crossed to other stuff, basically. And Subcool didn't want to use
[30:02.100 --> 30:06.500]  the name Jack Herrera, so it's Jack the Ripper. That's how these names come up.
[30:07.300 --> 30:12.260]  I've got a strain that I wanted to call it the Golden Road. It's a golden goat cross. And of
[30:12.260 --> 30:17.700]  course, that's a Grateful Dead song. So my names come from trying to honor the parent strains.
[30:18.740 --> 30:23.620]  And so I did get creative. I'm going to say this name here on the show that it's not out yet,
[30:23.620 --> 30:30.980]  but this is my cross. Gorilla Glue number four crossed to the Grateful Dog is called
[30:30.980 --> 30:34.740]  Grip Tape. And that's for my skateboard friends. You know what grip tape is on your skateboard.
[30:34.740 --> 30:39.060]  It's that shit that makes your feet stick to the board a little bit. I call it grip tape because
[30:39.060 --> 30:44.420]  it is sticky. It would be called fly paper, but fly paper is already taken. And grip tape kind
[30:44.420 --> 30:48.660]  of honors my skateboard friends. So that's where the names come from. We're not just spouting out
[30:48.660 --> 30:54.260]  random shit. Some guys are. One of my best sellers lately has actually been a strain that's called
[30:54.260 --> 30:58.260]  Blue Healer that was named by our good buddy Spence from the Garden of Weeden. It's actually
[30:58.260 --> 31:03.540]  Blue Dream crossed to the Grateful Dog. So Grateful Dog gives you a dog name, the blue,
[31:03.540 --> 31:08.580]  Blue Healer. It's named after a dog to keep the Grateful Dog reference. And it's also got the
[31:08.580 --> 31:13.540]  word healer in there because it's going to make you feel better. So it's just me trying to be
[31:13.540 --> 31:17.300]  silly and trying to be creative and honor the parents. And you have to name it something.
[31:18.020 --> 31:23.460]  You can't just call it X5. Maybe you can, but that would be boring. That's not good marketing.
[31:24.420 --> 31:27.940]  All right. So that's enough of that article. I just wanted to talk about how I named strains
[31:27.940 --> 31:32.740]  and why I named them what I named them. If you gave me like anything that I crossed to ghost OG,
[31:32.740 --> 31:36.180]  it's going to be called ghost, whatever I crossed it to. You know what I mean? Ghost dog,
[31:36.180 --> 31:41.540]  ghost goat, the golden ghost, you know, shit like that. It just, if I cross golden goat to stuff,
[31:41.540 --> 31:47.300]  it probably got the word gold to put in there. That's just how I do it. All right. I've only
[31:47.300 --> 31:51.140]  been going for 32 minutes, you guys, but I don't have a lot else to say. I honestly didn't have
[31:51.140 --> 31:54.820]  time to prepare for this episode. I don't, I didn't want to stress out over this one.
[31:54.820 --> 31:59.060]  I wanted to hang out with you guys, take a couple dabs. Let's do that. Let's do that. Let's get a
[31:59.060 --> 32:02.340]  dab together. All right, you guys take a second. I'm going to ramble here while you guys get a
[32:02.340 --> 32:07.780]  dab together to dab with me. I am proud because I'm going to dab shatter that I made myself.
[32:07.780 --> 32:12.660]  Oh yeah. I did that. I made hash and then spins vac purged it for me. I got it in there and got
[32:12.660 --> 32:17.380]  it going, but I had to leave. So he finished it for me. The stuff got purged for 35 hours.
[32:18.100 --> 32:21.380]  It's pretty damn dank. I hope you got a dab ready by now. Let's take a dab together and then we'll
[32:21.380 --> 32:27.860]  start wrapping up the show. I'm going to hit the, uh, I've got the hit man, E-series sidecar
[32:28.580 --> 32:34.340]  with a highly educated infinity nail on it. Attached to the highly educated infinity nail
[32:34.340 --> 32:42.580]  is the emo tech, uh, G nail. That's always on. I've got mine set to eight 50 right now,
[32:42.580 --> 32:46.980]  which people say is kind of high, but honestly, if I put it any lower, I don't get a big chunky
[32:46.980 --> 32:51.540]  dab when I carb cap it. So here we go. Shout out to emo tech, shout out to hit man, shout out to
[32:51.540 --> 32:57.460]  highly educated titanium and shout out to garden of Whedon and Angela too. Since I'm doing shout
[32:57.460 --> 33:15.460]  outs, here we go. Let's do a dab. Yeah. I like those big old chunky dabs and you're not sure
[33:15.460 --> 33:22.020]  if you're going to cry or cough or die. All right. So this will be fun. I'm going to try to do the
