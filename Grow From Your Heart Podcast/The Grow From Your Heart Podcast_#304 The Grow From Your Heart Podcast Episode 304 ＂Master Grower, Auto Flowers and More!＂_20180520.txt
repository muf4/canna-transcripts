[01:00.330 --> 01:04.650]  Thanks again for joining me. Ladies and gentlemen, I owe a huge thank you, shout
[01:04.650 --> 01:09.490]  out to everyone who has supported the show on Patreon. Thank you. With all of
[01:09.490 --> 01:14.410]  your help, I was able to grab the new MacBook I have been trying to get. Ladies
[01:14.410 --> 01:18.050]  and gentlemen, I'm recording this episode on a brand new MacBook Pro. I've got the
[01:18.050 --> 01:23.410]  15.4 inch monitor. I've got the i7 processor. It took me about three or four
[01:23.410 --> 01:26.610]  hours to get this thing all set up and ready to rock. I played with it yesterday
[01:26.610 --> 01:30.770]  and now I am here recording a brand new episode on the brand new machine that I
[01:30.770 --> 01:34.770]  could not have done without you. So thanks for your help everybody. I truly,
[01:34.770 --> 01:41.090]  truly appreciate all of the Patreon support. Thank you. Alright, usually I like
[01:41.090 --> 01:44.490]  to start these episodes by letting you know what I'm smoking on. Today I'm
[01:44.490 --> 01:49.330]  taking dabs of Gorilla Glue number four high cannabinoid full spectrum extract. I
[01:49.330 --> 01:55.650]  just opened up the little mini jar and this gassy funk, this sweet gassy turp
[01:55.650 --> 02:00.050]  just hit me right in the face. It's gassy and funky and it is delicious. Ladies
[02:00.050 --> 02:03.770]  and gentlemen, it's got me in a great mood. It's got a really heavy face high.
[02:03.770 --> 02:09.190]  I feel like my head got slow. It was like putting cinder blocks on my brain. Anyway,
[02:09.190 --> 02:14.050]  great concentrates, tastes great, smells great, and the dabs were super, super
[02:14.050 --> 02:17.050]  smooth. It felt like I took a little tiny dab and got a whole bunch of smoke.
[02:17.050 --> 02:20.490]  Remember I was talking about I go through those phases where I can smoke
[02:20.490 --> 02:24.610]  super heavy and I don't get lit and then I go through phases where I can take a
[02:24.610 --> 02:28.850]  little tiny dab and I get super wrecked? The past few days have been those phases
[02:28.850 --> 02:32.810]  where I could take a little tiny dab and I get super duper wrecked. It's been
[02:32.810 --> 02:36.850]  pretty nice. Kind of saving on the concentrates that way. Anyway, let's move
[02:36.850 --> 02:40.530]  on with the podcast. Ladies and gentlemen, don't forget about the Hella Dank Seed

[03:59.530 --> 04:03.770]  episode I mentioned that I was going to go to Best Buy and pick up the MacBook
[04:03.770 --> 04:08.170]  and I would let you know how that went. Let you know if I had to act a fool. Let
[04:08.170 --> 04:12.930]  you know if they were nice and polite. So here's how the whole story goes. Well
[04:12.930 --> 04:16.210]  we'll start from the day I went to go buy it. I walked into Best Buy and I was
[04:16.210 --> 04:19.410]  like hey I've got this picture of this computer on my screen. I'd like this
[04:19.410 --> 04:21.970]  please. And they're like oh give me a few minutes I'll find that for you. He went
[04:21.970 --> 04:25.450]  to go find it and he came back with a bewildered look on his face and he said
[04:25.450 --> 04:28.610]  sir I hate to say this I can't find that computer in my store. And I was like well
[04:28.610 --> 04:31.890]  I've got money I'd like to buy it now if you've got it. Just to encourage him you
[04:31.890 --> 04:34.410]  know like maybe he thought I was just browsing or something. Just let him know
[04:34.410 --> 04:37.970]  I've got money I will take it if you can find it. I'm gonna look around for a
[04:37.970 --> 04:41.810]  minute. So I looked around and him and another guy came up. The other guy
[04:41.810 --> 04:45.290]  claimed to be the inventory manager. He's like sir we cannot find that computer
[04:45.290 --> 04:50.010]  here but we can order it for you. So they ordered it in from another store and they
[04:50.010 --> 04:53.010]  also gave me a pretty fat discount for making me wait around and having to look
[04:53.010 --> 04:56.930]  for it. So I got a nice deal. They ordered the computer. They told me it would be
[04:56.930 --> 05:03.330]  here on Thursday. Wednesday night at 855 I got an email saying hey your computer
[05:03.330 --> 05:07.050]  is available. The shitty part about that is the store closed at 9 o'clock and
[05:07.050 --> 05:10.210]  it's about 20 minutes away from my house. So it was kind of just a big tease.
[05:10.210 --> 05:13.010]  They're like hey your computer is in here you can come stare at it through
[05:13.010 --> 05:16.530]  the window if you'd like but that's the best you can do tonight. So I had to wait
[05:16.530 --> 05:20.130]  until the next day. Of course I had to work all day. I kept saying it's I would
[05:20.130 --> 05:23.090]  like to leave a little bit early. I would like to leave just a little bit early.
[05:23.090 --> 05:27.330]  But I'm the manager I can usually make that happen but fate was just not letting
[05:27.330 --> 05:30.930]  it happen. Everything needed my attention so I had to work a little extra late
[05:30.930 --> 05:34.930]  that day. But I did get off work and I did make it to Best Buy and here's the
[05:34.930 --> 05:39.210]  part you guys want to hear. I walked into Best Buy and I said hey I'm here to pick
[05:39.210 --> 05:42.930]  up my computer and she said you have an ID and I showed her my ID and she turned
[05:42.930 --> 05:46.930]  around and she picked up a box off of the counter and she set it down and she
[05:46.930 --> 05:50.250]  said have a good day sir and I walked out with my computer. There were no
[05:50.250 --> 05:54.210]  problems there were no issues I did not have to act a fool. I got to high-five
[05:54.210 --> 05:56.810]  the guy on the way out and I drove home and played with my new computer. So I got
[05:56.810 --> 05:59.930]  the new MacBook you guys. It took me a little bit to get some things set up.
[05:59.930 --> 06:05.050]  There was one the Tascam software did not want to install but we got tech guy
[06:05.050 --> 06:08.130]  Tony over here and Tony helped me out. Shout out to Tony thanks for coming over
[06:08.130 --> 06:12.410]  on such short notice bro. And we got it running. So the new MacBook is in action
[06:12.410 --> 06:15.890]  ladies and gentlemen. Big thanks and a huge shout out to everybody who
[06:15.890 --> 06:19.930]  contributed to the Patreon campaign. You guys covered probably half if not a
[06:19.930 --> 06:23.490]  little more on the cost of this new machine so thank you I appreciate it. I
[06:23.490 --> 06:27.050]  hope the show sounds good. I'm sure it's gonna be easier to load the show and it
[06:27.050 --> 06:31.090]  will be easier to make videos and now I've got two machines that I can make
[06:31.090 --> 06:34.490]  YouTube videos on on which I can make YouTube videos. Sorry I'm trying to be
[06:34.490 --> 06:37.810]  nerdy with my English and now that means I can speed up my production process.
[06:37.850 --> 06:42.690]  We'll get caught up in less time. So thank you. Let's move on with the podcast
[06:42.690 --> 06:46.810]  ladies and gentlemen. I've got an email from a friend of ours. It's kind of a
[06:46.810 --> 06:49.770]  long email. I'm not going to read the whole thing on the air. A lot of it was
[06:49.770 --> 06:53.530]  just kind of a personal thing to me. He asked a couple of questions that don't
[06:53.530 --> 06:57.450]  need to be read on the air but there is part that I want to put on the show so
[06:57.450 --> 07:00.330]  I'm gonna start from the beginning and then we'll get to the part I want to
[07:00.330 --> 07:02.250]  talk about. It goes a lot like this.
[07:02.250 --> 07:04.450]  Rasta Jeff what's up? It's been a while since I've
[07:04.450 --> 07:08.050]  messaged you. I'm still listening every week and I'm still supporting you in all
[07:08.050 --> 07:11.330]  you do. Hey good to hear from you man and thanks again for supporting me. He goes
[07:11.330 --> 07:16.210]  on to say, thank you again for being such a great resource. I'm emailing you to ask
[07:16.210 --> 07:20.010]  you a question and maybe a favor. God knows you don't owe me anything and you
[07:20.010 --> 07:23.210]  have no idea who I really am but I'll try to keep this short and maybe let you
[07:23.210 --> 07:27.650]  know where I'm coming from. He says, if you refer to my previous email I'm
[07:27.650 --> 07:32.450]  from Albuquerque, New Mexico and a big fan of the podcast and your art. Recently
[07:32.450 --> 07:36.210]  I have acquired my medical marijuana card in New Mexico and I'm fully legal.
[07:36.210 --> 07:40.570]  What a difference in feeling it is, what a difference in feeling it is to walk
[07:40.570 --> 07:44.890]  out of a shop and know I'm not a criminal in the eyes of the law. Man that
[07:44.890 --> 07:48.810]  is such a huge feeling. I remember that the first time I went to go buy medical
[07:48.810 --> 07:52.130]  marijuana and I walked out of the place and I was like dude you just walked out
[07:52.130 --> 07:55.290]  of the weed place loud and proud with weed and everyone knows that's the weed
[07:55.290 --> 07:58.970]  place and you're walking to and I had to like calm myself down and think oh yeah
[07:58.970 --> 08:02.050]  that's the weed store and you got a weed card in your pocket you can do this.
[08:02.050 --> 08:06.090]  It is such a great feeling it's almost surreal the first couple of times. And
[08:06.090 --> 08:09.450]  then that first time that you're driving and you got your weed in the car and the
[08:09.450 --> 08:13.290]  cops get behind you and you're like oh shit and you go oh wait never mind and
[08:13.290 --> 08:16.610]  all your worries go away because the only thing I used to do that would get
[08:16.610 --> 08:21.130]  me in trouble is have some herb in the car. Now I'm totally golden. Alright the
[08:21.130 --> 08:24.690]  email goes on he says I had never cared much for being legal and always feared
[08:24.690 --> 08:29.570]  being on in the system or on some sort of a list. I'm also not your stereotypical
[08:29.570 --> 08:33.210]  stoner. Nothing against my stoner bros but I do not fit the mold and people
[08:33.210 --> 08:37.690]  generally assume I do not partake. Contrary to this belief however I am
[08:37.690 --> 08:41.650]  highly knowledgeable about cannabis and I have consumed countless hours of content
[08:41.650 --> 08:46.090]  and research. I've been a closet activist and a literal closet grower
[08:46.090 --> 08:51.610]  for a very long time Rasta Jeff. You have inspired me. I am 33 and I am on a and I
[08:51.610 --> 08:56.010]  am a new father and I'm a full-time employee of the local university. After
[08:56.010 --> 08:58.810]  going through some complications with my son's birth and having a small
[08:58.890 --> 09:02.650]  interaction with child services I've become fully motivated and becoming a
[09:02.650 --> 09:07.750]  positive face in the cannabis movement. Hey thank you for for joining us so
[09:07.750 --> 09:11.250]  strongly I appreciate that. Thank you for becoming a face in the cannabis movement.
[09:11.250 --> 09:15.890]  We need more articulate strong-minded people like yourself joining this
[09:15.890 --> 09:19.850]  movement so thanks for jumping in with us. He also says nothing negative came
[09:19.850 --> 09:23.210]  from this interaction but I came out of it with a better understanding of the
[09:23.210 --> 09:27.770]  laws point of view. I've held myself back and I feel I have kept my talents and my
[09:27.770 --> 09:33.330]  heart to myself and I am ready to fulfill my destiny so to speak. So here
[09:33.330 --> 09:38.930]  is my question I said I had for you. He asks what qualifies someone to be a
[09:38.930 --> 09:46.010]  master grower? And then he also says for lack of better term. Um that's I kind of
[09:46.010 --> 09:51.570]  want to jump off on a rant right there. In Colorado the term master grower is a
[09:51.570 --> 09:56.530]  huge joke it's one of the most cringy terms or words or phrases you could
[09:56.530 --> 10:00.210]  throw out in the cannabis industry right now. Anybody that's been growing
[10:00.210 --> 10:06.650]  cannabis for quite a while before this medical marijuana movement cringes at
[10:06.650 --> 10:13.690]  the phrase master grower. Technically master grower simply means that you are
[10:13.690 --> 10:18.170]  the boss of the cultivation facility. You are the lead grower. It is another term
[10:18.170 --> 10:22.450]  for lead grower. I wish everybody would just change their badge from master
[10:22.450 --> 10:28.770]  grower to lead grower or cultivation director or a cultivation manager or
[10:28.770 --> 10:32.970]  something just a little less douchey and egotistical sounding. It's calling
[10:32.970 --> 10:35.930]  yourself a master grower is like saying that you're the black belt that you have
[10:35.930 --> 10:38.690]  got all of the knowledge that you are the champion that you could head kick
[10:38.690 --> 10:43.770]  everybody that you know all the forms all the tricks and a lot of us are not
[10:43.770 --> 10:50.650]  masters. I am the most qualified and most experienced grower at my facility which
[10:50.810 --> 10:56.330]  makes me the cultivation leader or the cultivation director but a lot of people
[10:56.330 --> 11:00.530]  so technically it's a position. Technically it's a title. It's a stamp on
[11:00.530 --> 11:08.930]  your paycheck position. Master grower. Culturally and societally it is more of
[11:08.930 --> 11:13.490]  a joke. Nobody takes you seriously if you say I'm the master grower. So that's
[11:13.490 --> 11:16.650]  just something I want to touch on here in Colorado. The phrase master grower is
[11:16.650 --> 11:20.490]  kind of a joke but you don't mean it in that way. You're asking what does it take
[11:20.490 --> 11:24.450]  to be a master grower and then you even said for example or lack of better term
[11:24.450 --> 11:28.330]  you just want to know what it takes to be at that level. Then he says I refer to
[11:28.330 --> 11:31.970]  myself as a humble green thumb and I'm not very outspoken about my talent but
[11:31.970 --> 11:36.450]  the proof is in my pudding. I'm grounded in caregiving and I follow exactly in
[11:36.450 --> 11:41.930]  line with your thinking. So what do you call a guy like me? Alright I call a guy
[11:41.930 --> 11:48.690]  like you a cultivation manager. A cultivation director. Now if you want to
[11:48.690 --> 11:53.010]  be a master grower in the terms and the not douchey terms in the terms of a
[11:53.010 --> 11:58.170]  black belt grower as in the terms of a cultivation manager what you need is
[11:58.170 --> 12:02.610]  cultivation experience. You definitely need cultivation experience. You have to
[12:02.610 --> 12:06.090]  be able to look at plants and say that plants too wet, that plant is too dry,
[12:06.090 --> 12:10.170]  that is powdery mildew, that is spider mite damage, those plants are too close
[12:10.170 --> 12:13.490]  together, those plants are too far apart, that light is too close to those plants.
[12:13.490 --> 12:18.090]  You have to be able to identify what's going on with the plants, what is going
[12:18.090 --> 12:24.210]  on with the room. You have to identify things on the fly every day at a rapid
[12:24.210 --> 12:29.690]  pace. You have to be able to think and adjust and adapt. You have to know you
[12:29.690 --> 12:34.010]  have to keep track of 20 different rooms and know how much water has gone in each
[12:34.010 --> 12:37.370]  room for the past couple of days. You have to be able to manage people. You
[12:37.370 --> 12:41.450]  have to have an eye for detail. You have to have a passion. You have to be there
[12:41.450 --> 12:46.050]  and you have to give a shit. That's what you need to be the master grower. It
[12:46.130 --> 12:49.770]  sounds like you possess all of these qualities. Don't be in too much of a
[12:49.770 --> 12:53.050]  hurry to call yourself a master grower. Keep calling yourself the humble green
[12:53.050 --> 12:57.730]  thumb because those are the best master growers. The humble green thumbs are the
[12:57.730 --> 13:01.990]  guys that should be running the large facilities. You know what to do. You can
[13:01.990 --> 13:05.810]  go at a certain pace to where you work fast enough but you don't rush through
[13:05.810 --> 13:10.730]  anything. You get everything done without screwing up. You don't drag your feet. You
[13:10.730 --> 13:14.770]  can lead the other people to keep them going at a fast pace. You can make a plan.
[13:14.770 --> 13:18.690]  You can make a schedule and you can encourage your team to do what needs to
[13:18.690 --> 13:22.810]  be done in a timely manner and keep it fun and have everybody motivated and
[13:22.810 --> 13:27.050]  encouraged and still get all of the shit done and break a sweat and at
[13:27.050 --> 13:31.610]  the end of the day everybody is proud of what they did. So it sounds like you
[13:31.610 --> 13:35.290]  could do that. That's what a master grower needs to do in a large cultivation
[13:35.290 --> 13:39.850]  facility. It's basically the same thing that any other boss needs to do in any
[13:39.850 --> 13:44.410]  position plus you have to have specialized skills for your industry
[13:44.450 --> 13:48.250]  which is cannabis knowledge. Now you have to have knowledge all the way
[13:48.250 --> 13:51.610]  through the process. You have to know how to cut a clone and you have to know how
[13:51.610 --> 13:55.250]  to get it all the way to the store. So knowledge of the full cannabis growth
[13:55.250 --> 14:01.290]  cycle is necessary. Knowledge of how to identify and manage pests is necessary
[14:01.290 --> 14:06.650]  and diseases. All the plant stuff. Also you have to be able to pay attention to
[14:06.650 --> 14:12.810]  electrical, HVAC, plumbing. Also you have to manage employees. Also you have to
[14:12.810 --> 14:17.770]  communicate between the employees and ownership and whoever else you may have.
[14:17.770 --> 14:23.730]  I've got contractors in the grower or in the grow on average three days a week. If
[14:23.730 --> 14:30.090]  it's not an electrician, a plumber, maybe an HVAC guy, if not the Department of
[14:30.090 --> 14:33.890]  Agriculture or the Department of Health, there's somebody coming in to do
[14:33.890 --> 14:37.410]  something. You have to be able to communicate with all different types of
[14:37.410 --> 14:41.570]  personalities. You have to be able to give instructions.
[14:41.570 --> 14:45.490]  You have to be able to deal with employees that kind of don't follow
[14:45.490 --> 14:48.330]  instructions properly. You have to be able to correct things. You have to be
[14:48.330 --> 14:52.530]  able to document things. You have to be able to give praise. You have to learn
[14:52.530 --> 14:57.570]  how to separate your dab time and your work time and your friendship and your
[14:57.570 --> 15:01.890]  management from your co-workers. Because once we go to lunch, I take off the name
[15:01.890 --> 15:05.410]  tag and we're friends. We're gonna take some dabs. We're gonna hang out. Even if
[15:05.410 --> 15:08.330]  you're the employee that fucked everything up all day, when we go to
[15:08.330 --> 15:11.530]  lunch, we're friends. We're gonna be cool. You have to learn how to keep that
[15:11.530 --> 15:14.450]  balance. You have to be able to discipline your friends. You have to be
[15:14.450 --> 15:17.970]  able to fire and write your friends up when the time comes. So those are things
[15:17.970 --> 15:23.690]  like any job that are going to be part of being a master grower. But the way you
[15:23.690 --> 15:26.530]  are trying to be qualified, it sounds like you were doing it. You love the
[15:26.530 --> 15:30.250]  plant. You have passion. You have an intention for detail and you care about
[15:30.250 --> 15:34.290]  what you're doing. And it sounds like since you work at a university, you were
[15:34.290 --> 15:37.010]  able to communicate. And through the email you sent, you can certainly
[15:37.130 --> 15:41.570]  communicate. So that's basically what it takes to be a master grower. You continue
[15:41.570 --> 15:46.730]  to be the humble green thumb and you will find a position as a master grower.
[15:46.730 --> 15:49.770]  I'm gonna keep reading a little bit of the email and then we're gonna cut it
[15:49.770 --> 15:52.930]  out short because some of this was just for me, like I said. He said, what do you
[15:52.930 --> 15:56.170]  call a guy like me? I call you a passionate grower. I call you highly
[15:56.170 --> 16:00.690]  qualified. I call you somebody that I respect as a grower. He goes on to say, I
[16:00.690 --> 16:04.770]  have worked with both small, personal, and large commercial growers. I have listened
[16:04.770 --> 16:08.650]  to every Grow From Your Heart episode, as well as all of the cannabis growing
[16:08.650 --> 16:12.770]  and culture podcasts available on my iPhone. I follow and watch with all, I
[16:12.770 --> 16:16.130]  follow and watch all of the very best no-till and sustainable growers I have
[16:16.130 --> 16:21.170]  found. And then he goes on to say that he's got all this cannabis knowledge and
[16:21.170 --> 16:25.610]  skills, but nothing to show for it except for a few jars of quality medicine and
[16:25.610 --> 16:31.250]  his iry feelings. Unfortunately, a lot of people feel that way in this
[16:31.250 --> 16:35.410]  industry and when you're trying to get into this industry, you can't bring your
[16:35.410 --> 16:38.610]  product to the dispensary to show, at least in Colorado, it's illegal to show
[16:38.610 --> 16:42.290]  up with product. You can't come to an interview with product. You're in New
[16:42.290 --> 16:46.730]  Mexico, you've got different rules there, you can probably bring in your product. I
[16:46.730 --> 16:50.010]  don't know, but if you can't and you feel like you don't have anything to show for
[16:50.010 --> 16:54.890]  it, a lot of these jobs are not hiring based on your growth skills and your
[16:54.890 --> 16:59.170]  outcome. A lot of them are hiring based on, do you fit with the team? Does your
[16:59.170 --> 17:04.610]  personality work? Can you be on time? We ask trick questions in the
[17:04.610 --> 17:08.090]  interview to see if you can catch on, see if you can follow instructions. We ask
[17:08.090 --> 17:11.450]  questions to, we're kind of milking information out of you. The first and
[17:11.450 --> 17:14.050]  fifth question were the same question, you just didn't realize it and you
[17:14.050 --> 17:16.810]  answered them differently and we started writing notes. Like that's the kind of
[17:16.810 --> 17:20.730]  shit that goes on in interviews, okay? Keep that in mind. So we're trying to
[17:20.730 --> 17:23.770]  check out your personality. We're making sure you mesh with the team, that you're
[17:23.770 --> 17:27.490]  responsible, that you're honest, that you're reliable. And those are the things
[17:27.530 --> 17:31.330]  that you need to bring to the interview. And this is everybody, I'm not just
[17:31.330 --> 17:33.810]  saying this for the guy that sent me the email. This is for everybody. If you're
[17:33.810 --> 17:38.090]  going for a cannabis related interview, don't wear your Bob Marley t-shirt, don't
[17:38.090 --> 17:43.850]  wear your Cheech and Chong t-shirt. Dress for the position you are applying for. Go
[17:43.850 --> 17:47.530]  in there and look like you've already been hired. Dress nice, comb your hair. I
[17:47.530 --> 17:51.130]  know I've got dreadlocks and shit, right? Do your hair, make your hair look good.
[17:51.130 --> 17:56.490]  Make yourself look presentable, brush your teeth, clean up your shave. If you
[17:56.490 --> 17:59.490]  got a scraggly ass shave, just tighten it up a little bit. Just try to look good,
[17:59.490 --> 18:03.970]  look presentable. You are about to represent this person's business. The
[18:03.970 --> 18:07.650]  customers that come into the business are going to be dealing with you. The
[18:07.650 --> 18:11.130]  plants that are grown by this business are going to be grown by you. You've got
[18:11.130 --> 18:15.530]  to be a trustworthy, reliable person that can represent our company. So you can't
[18:15.530 --> 18:18.450]  bring your jars to the grow. You can't bring your product. You could scroll
[18:18.450 --> 18:22.290]  through your Instagram and show us it doesn't impress us. Show up and kick ass
[18:22.290 --> 18:26.010]  in the interview. That's what you can bring. Alright, there's more to this email.
[18:26.010 --> 18:30.130]  It doesn't really need to be put out on the air, so I'm going to keep that part
[18:30.130 --> 18:34.850]  to myself. Dude, if you want to be a master grower,
[18:34.850 --> 18:38.890]  you already are. You just don't have the title because you don't work in a
[18:38.890 --> 18:43.210]  Colorado facility. You have, from what I can tell by your email, it sounds like
[18:43.210 --> 18:47.290]  you've got the qualifications. The way to actually earn that title would be to
[18:47.290 --> 18:51.210]  start at a grow. Don't be afraid to take a trimmer position. Don't be afraid to
[18:51.210 --> 18:55.770]  take a grow tech position. I started in my position as a grow tech. I was the
[18:55.770 --> 18:58.650]  bottom there as a trimmer, and then there's grow techs, and then the hierarchy
[18:58.650 --> 19:04.530]  moves up to my position. My 90-day review, I was promoted to cultivation director
[19:04.530 --> 19:09.610]  or master grower. So go somewhere. Prove yourself. Don't be afraid to start at the
[19:09.610 --> 19:14.610]  bottom, and you can be promoted to master grower. Now one thing that a master of
[19:14.610 --> 19:18.210]  anything would do is keep learning. If you go in there and you start as a
[19:18.210 --> 19:21.770]  trimmer, you trim like a maniac. You're on time for work every day. You follow
[19:21.770 --> 19:24.690]  instructions. You volunteer to help when there's more work to do. You get promoted
[19:24.690 --> 19:29.290]  to grow tech. You become a good grow tech. One of the growers gets sick, doesn't
[19:29.290 --> 19:33.370]  show up. Now you've got his position. Now you're hanging out with the lead
[19:33.370 --> 19:37.610]  grower, the master grower, all day, every day, working hand-in-hand with him. Don't
[19:37.610 --> 19:41.530]  be mad that you can't get his position because it's taken. Your job now is to
[19:41.530 --> 19:45.770]  absorb everything you can about commercial production, about cannabis
[19:45.770 --> 19:51.290]  cultivation on a large scale. Absorb everything you can. Be present. Don't be
[19:51.290 --> 19:54.570]  angry that you're not getting the position you want. Be present and be
[19:54.570 --> 19:58.210]  excited about the free education you're getting while you're getting paid. You're
[19:58.210 --> 20:01.570]  becoming a better grower. You're building your resume. One thing you should do
[20:01.570 --> 20:06.370]  while you're in these facilities is write down everything you learn. If you
[20:06.370 --> 20:09.610]  learn a new piece of equipment, a new tool, a new method, a new trick, a new
[20:09.610 --> 20:13.810]  technique, a new idea, write it down. Add it to your grow journal. Add it to your
[20:13.810 --> 20:18.130]  resume. If you can drive a scissor lift now because you worked in a cultivation
[20:18.130 --> 20:21.890]  facility, put that on your resume. If you can drive a scissor lift or a forklift,
[20:21.890 --> 20:25.730]  it makes you much more hireable for my facility because we get deliveries, we
[20:25.730 --> 20:28.530]  need the forklift. If there's a guy that can't drive the forklift or there's no
[20:28.530 --> 20:31.730]  one there that can drive the forklift, that shit stays on the
[20:31.730 --> 20:34.930]  truck and the truck drives away and comes back when it can. So if you're able
[20:34.930 --> 20:38.210]  to operate a forklift, you're much more hireable. The scissor lift, we got to
[20:38.210 --> 20:41.770]  change bulbs. The guy that knows how to use the scissor lift, we call him in, he
[20:41.770 --> 20:45.210]  gets extra hours. He can drive that scissor lift, put up the bulbs. So that
[20:45.210 --> 20:48.690]  kind of stuff helps. Write down everything you do and then you will get
[20:48.690 --> 20:53.210]  to be the master grower in a facility. In this email, he mentions, our friend
[20:53.210 --> 20:56.730]  mentions that he was offered a job but the place does not grow from their heart.
[20:56.730 --> 21:00.410]  So he's going to be patient and try to find himself a job that meets his
[21:00.410 --> 21:04.210]  standards. I applaud you for that. I applaud you for not compromising your
[21:04.210 --> 21:07.370]  standards just for employment in the industry you want to work in. That means
[21:07.370 --> 21:10.170]  that you're going to grow from your heart. That when you do find a facility
[21:10.170 --> 21:13.290]  that appreciates your heart and your care for the plant, that you're going to
[21:13.290 --> 21:18.130]  give them your all. So be patient, keep looking until you find a facility that
[21:18.130 --> 21:23.770]  does work for you. I do have friends down there at Organica and Albuquerque. I
[21:23.770 --> 21:27.890]  don't know what I could do by pulling strings because honestly, the only thing
[21:27.890 --> 21:32.090]  I know you by is your screen name and your email. But go to Organica and say
[21:32.090 --> 21:34.730]  hey I listened to the Grow From Your Heart podcast. I've heard great things
[21:34.730 --> 21:38.610]  about you. I email with Rasta Jeff. Is there any way that I can get an interview?
[21:38.610 --> 21:43.890]  Just walk in and ask dude. You walking in and setting it up on your own is
[21:43.890 --> 21:47.770]  gonna look way better than me trying to set it up for you. So go in there, hit
[21:47.770 --> 21:52.770]  them up, say hey where can I work? When do I start? And tell them the stuff you
[21:52.770 --> 21:56.650]  told me man. That's how you become the master grower. Shout out to my friends at
[21:56.650 --> 22:02.050]  Organica also. Hey guys I should add that a lot of what I said applies to any
[22:02.050 --> 22:05.490]  position you were trying to get in any job. If you're trying to get a cannabis
[22:05.850 --> 22:10.250]  industry job, you get those jobs just like you get any other industry job. You
[22:10.250 --> 22:14.210]  need to go apply. Don't sit at home on your computer and try to find a job on
[22:14.210 --> 22:20.930]  Facebook or on some website. Get up. Get cleaned up. Look sharp. Put on some clean
[22:20.930 --> 22:25.450]  clothes. Drive your ass to the place where you want to work and apply there.
[22:25.450 --> 22:31.330]  Talk to people. Go make contact with humans. There's no way to make an
[22:31.330 --> 22:36.050]  impression online unless your resume is super dope. And they see, we see so many
[22:36.050 --> 22:41.810]  resumes but honestly we think the super dope ones are fake. So go there. Let the
[22:41.810 --> 22:48.090]  people see who you are. You may fit. You may not. If you fit, if they see you and
[22:48.090 --> 22:50.650]  they say man this looks like a person that would fit in with our crew. They
[22:50.650 --> 22:53.450]  look like they'd probably go hang out with Jeff after work and they look like
[22:53.450 --> 22:59.050]  they probably listen to the same music as Mark. Show up. Make yourself known. If
[22:59.290 --> 23:02.970]  you're not noticed, if you don't show up and make yourself noticed, you're just
[23:02.970 --> 23:05.970]  another resume. You're just another email. You're just another piece of white paper
[23:05.970 --> 23:11.650]  with a bunch of letters on it. Show up. Talk to somebody. Talk to a manager. Show
[23:11.650 --> 23:14.650]  up. Ask, hey who does the hiring? And if they're not there, if they're not
[23:14.650 --> 23:18.330]  available, ask for their phone number or their card. Find out when they'll be
[23:18.330 --> 23:23.130]  there again. Go back. Ask for them. Speak with them. Shake their hand. When they
[23:23.130 --> 23:27.250]  come out from wherever they are, say hey whatever hiring person, hey Rasta Jeff I
[23:27.250 --> 23:30.610]  know you're busy. I don't want to take up too much of your time. My name is this.
[23:30.610 --> 23:35.850]  I'd really love an opportunity to work in your facility. Here's my resume. Shake
[23:35.850 --> 23:41.210]  their hand. Look them in the eye. Smile. Get the hell out of their face. Be seen.
[23:41.210 --> 23:45.730]  Be noticed. Do not waste their time because everybody that has a manager
[23:45.730 --> 23:50.090]  title and a dispensary or a grow, they're fucking busy. They've got shit to manage.
[23:50.090 --> 23:54.770]  Get them your resume. Make eye contact. Now you're in that person's brain. Okay
[23:54.770 --> 23:58.930]  you've planted a little seed. Now call back in a couple of days and ask for
[23:58.930 --> 24:02.850]  that person. Hey I gave you my resume the other day. We shook hands. I wanted to
[24:02.850 --> 24:05.890]  see if you had a chance to look at that. And they're either gonna be cool with
[24:05.890 --> 24:08.490]  you or not by now. You're either bugging them or not. And if you're bugging them,
[24:08.490 --> 24:11.290]  fuck them. You don't need that job. You weren't gonna get it anyway. If you're
[24:11.290 --> 24:14.010]  not bugging them and they're happy with you, they're gonna talk to you about it.
[24:14.010 --> 24:18.010]  They're gonna say yeah I'll look it over. Talk to my other manager about it. We'll
[24:18.010 --> 24:21.570]  call you back in a couple of days. You've got to beat them to the punch. In a
[24:21.570 --> 24:24.930]  couple of days, you go to the store where you found them and hit them up
[24:24.930 --> 24:28.650]  again. Hey manager guy, I was wondering if you got a chance to look at my resume
[24:28.650 --> 24:31.090]  and talk to your manager because I'm really interested in getting a position
[24:31.090 --> 24:34.970]  with your facility. There are so many resumes. There are so many phone calls.
[24:34.970 --> 24:38.170]  There are so many messages. You've got to go and you've got to push the buttons
[24:38.170 --> 24:43.090]  yourself you guys. So in this industry, if you want a job in any position, you've
[24:43.090 --> 24:46.810]  got to go get it. They're not, they are online. They're being advertised online.
[24:46.810 --> 24:50.850]  If you just want to be another click, if you want to be another whoever at
[24:50.850 --> 24:55.050]  whoever.com, go for it. Or you can walk in there and you can shake somebody's
[24:55.050 --> 24:58.850]  hand and be remembered. People don't forget you if they see your face. I
[24:58.850 --> 25:02.610]  couldn't tell you any of the email addresses on any of the resumes I read
[25:02.610 --> 25:06.810]  this week. That's coming from somebody that does the hiring and firing and is a
[25:06.810 --> 25:09.690]  manager. I don't remember any of the email addresses but I remember
[25:09.690 --> 25:13.330]  everybody's face that shook my hand and said hey can I have a job? I don't have a
[25:13.330 --> 25:17.690]  job for you but when I do I'll remember your face. Alright so this email wraps up
[25:17.690 --> 25:20.790]  and I got off on a long rant. Thank you guys for listening to my rants. I love it
[25:20.790 --> 25:24.750]  it's fun. Thanks for just supporting the show. He goes on to say thanks again
[25:24.750 --> 25:28.110]  Ross and Jeff for all you do. Even if you can't help me out I still love you and I
[25:28.110 --> 25:32.990]  will give my mom a hug for you. Hey much love and respect in return. I appreciate
[25:32.990 --> 25:37.430]  it. Hope you're doing well down there in New Mexico. He says growers love and then
[25:37.430 --> 25:40.630]  he says PS you do not have to read this on the air. I'm just reaching out. There
[25:40.630 --> 25:43.190]  was some of it that was worth reading on the air. Some of it was personal so I
[25:43.190 --> 25:46.390]  used what I could my friend. Thanks for the great email. You guys if you'd like
[25:46.390 --> 25:50.310]  to send me an email my email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com
[25:50.310 --> 25:55.910]  I would love to get your emails so I can answer your questions. Alright I've
[25:55.910 --> 26:00.870]  got another email here. Let's get right into this one also. This one says Ross to
[26:00.870 --> 26:05.150]  Jeff I'm a new grower in SoCal and I really enjoy your show. Hey thank you man
[26:05.150 --> 26:09.030]  I appreciate that. He goes on to say on your next seed
[26:09.030 --> 26:12.710]  discussion could you also cover auto flowers? I'm really interested in doing
[26:12.710 --> 26:17.590]  auto flowers outdoors to maximize the number of harvest per year. What do you
[26:17.590 --> 26:21.150]  think? And then he also says thanks for sharing your awesome knowledge and being
[26:21.150 --> 26:25.550]  a positive force. Peace. And then he signed it with his name. He knows his
[26:25.550 --> 26:27.970]  name he didn't say if you wanted me to say it or not so dude thanks for the
[26:27.970 --> 26:32.030]  email. Big shout out you know who you are. Anyway he said on your next seed
[26:32.030 --> 26:39.150]  discussion could you also cover auto flowers? I really don't grow or mess with
[26:39.150 --> 26:43.870]  auto flowers. I don't have a lot of experience. You said you were interested
[26:43.870 --> 26:47.550]  in doing auto flowers outdoors to maximize the number of harvest per year.
[26:47.550 --> 26:52.350]  What do I think? I think that everything I know about auto flowers that is the
[26:52.350 --> 26:57.790]  perfect reason for auto flower seeds. A lot of people hate on feminized seeds. A
[26:57.790 --> 27:02.550]  lot of people have hatred for auto flower seeds. I believe that everything
[27:02.550 --> 27:08.190]  has its application and your purpose is the perfect application for auto flower
[27:08.190 --> 27:13.150]  seeds. You can maximize your number of harvests outdoors because you don't have
[27:13.150 --> 27:18.430]  to have a veg time. So it's beautiful. I think that your intention is going to
[27:18.430 --> 27:23.310]  work perfectly with auto flowers. You're gonna get what you want. There was a
[27:23.310 --> 27:27.950]  large bust in southern Colorado just about 45 minutes south of me. There's a
[27:27.950 --> 27:33.990]  national forest and a cartel had set up an illegal grow in that national forest
[27:33.990 --> 27:40.470]  and they were growing cannabis on a large scale and when they got caught it
[27:40.590 --> 27:45.710]  was not the right season for cannabis to be flowering and the pictures that they
[27:45.710 --> 27:50.470]  showed were straight-up flowering plants and fields of plants in different stages
[27:50.470 --> 27:54.750]  and me and my weed head friends were sitting here watching the news and
[27:54.750 --> 27:58.590]  looking at the pictures going wait a minute how did they do that because it's
[27:58.590 --> 28:02.390]  if you know about growing cannabis it's an annual plant you put it outside and
[28:02.390 --> 28:07.430]  it flowers because of the Sun cycle because of the night cycle so all of the
[28:07.430 --> 28:10.990]  plants are outside how are some of them flower this far how are some of them
[28:10.990 --> 28:14.710]  flower this far and how are some of them still in veg and then it dawned on me
[28:14.710 --> 28:17.550]  they're using fucking auto flowers and they're just plotting different size
[28:17.550 --> 28:21.430]  plots so they've got a perpetual grow happening with auto flowers on other
[28:21.430 --> 28:28.630]  people's property on the national forest land so yes it is very very feasible and
[28:28.630 --> 28:32.630]  that is a very good idea that is a very good application that's honestly the
[28:32.630 --> 28:36.470]  best application for auto flowers is to run them outdoors so that you can
[28:36.470 --> 28:40.670]  maximize the number of harvest outdoors I hope the auto flowers work for you I
[28:40.670 --> 28:43.670]  hope you're able to maximize your harvest I hope you're able to get some
[28:43.670 --> 28:47.310]  high potency auto flowers the only downside to auto flowers is that you
[28:47.310 --> 28:51.510]  have to keep buying new seeds hopefully the cost of not having to veg them and
[28:51.510 --> 28:56.310]  the opportunity to maximize the number of harvests offsets the price of having
[28:56.310 --> 29:00.110]  to buy new seeds for every run because that's the only the only catch there is
[29:00.110 --> 29:02.950]  if you weren't running auto flowers you could just cut clones and put more out
[29:02.950 --> 29:05.270]  there but then you'd have to veg them and you'd have to have space you'd have
[29:05.390 --> 29:10.070]  to have a mom plant so what you're doing is perfect I have no problems with your
[29:10.070 --> 29:15.350]  use of auto flowers and I'm usually kind of a hater on auto flower seeds so dude
[29:15.350 --> 29:18.550]  thank you for the great email and thanks for the opportunity to teach my
[29:18.550 --> 29:22.750]  listeners a very good application for auto flowers you guys quit hating the
[29:22.750 --> 29:26.510]  auto flowers because this is gonna work well this guy is going to get more
[29:26.510 --> 29:31.510]  harvests next year than you it may be auto flower bud but he's going to have
[29:31.510 --> 29:34.590]  more of it and he's gonna have more frequent harvest and it's all gonna be
[29:34.590 --> 29:38.910]  outdoor sunshine bud and he's not gonna have to have a veg space so quit hating
[29:38.910 --> 29:42.550]  on the auto flowers you guys this guy is gonna kick some ass with auto flowers
[29:42.550 --> 29:45.630]  this season all right but this whole year shit not even this season his
[29:45.630 --> 29:49.670]  season is all year you get one season so don't make fun of the auto flowers
[29:49.670 --> 29:53.270]  anymore you guys we found a perfect application here on the show hey dude I
[29:53.270 --> 29:57.910]  know my answer was super short and I did not give a lot of details but you uh you
[29:57.910 --> 30:00.830]  asked if this was gonna work basically and yes this is gonna work beautifully
[30:00.950 --> 30:06.270]  you have got the perfect idea for auto flowers so yeah it's gonna work man good
[30:06.270 --> 30:10.670]  idea all right let's move on to this next email this next email comes from
[30:10.670 --> 30:13.750]  somebody who is very smart because they said right away if this makes it to the
[30:13.750 --> 30:19.070]  podcast please don't read my name but I will read the subject it says happy st.
[30:19.070 --> 30:23.590]  Paddy's Day from Ireland ladies and gentlemen we've got listeners in Ireland
[30:23.590 --> 30:27.030]  big shout out to everybody out there in Ireland listening to the podcast I do
[30:27.230 --> 30:30.990]  not know the rules on cannabis in Ireland although I would assume they do
[30:30.990 --> 30:35.030]  not tolerate cannabis they don't seem like they take much bullshit seems like
[30:35.030 --> 30:39.110]  a place that if you fall out of line you will quickly be put back in line so be
[30:39.110 --> 30:43.070]  careful if you're growing consuming or possessing or even talking about
[30:43.070 --> 30:46.670]  cannabis in Ireland let me know if I'm wrong I'm really curious what's it like
[30:46.670 --> 30:51.990]  what's the temperature on cannabis there anyway the email goes on it says many
[30:51.990 --> 30:56.470]  congratulations on 300 episodes hey thank you I appreciate that he also says
[30:56.470 --> 31:00.230]  I've listened to them all most of them twice thanks to the throwback Thursday's
[31:00.230 --> 31:05.590]  hey that is commitment that's dedication thank you and I apologize you've had to
[31:05.590 --> 31:08.990]  listen to me for a lot of hours I'm sorry you've had to hear my voice drone
[31:08.990 --> 31:13.510]  on about nothing for so much the message goes on to say I am a chef and I work
[31:13.510 --> 31:18.350]  alone so you keep me company during prep hey thanks for hanging out man anyway
[31:18.350 --> 31:21.950]  the email keeps going and he says I'm not a grower given we are deep in
[31:21.950 --> 31:25.350]  prohibition land the first few steps on the road to medical have been taken in
[31:25.350 --> 31:29.750]  Ireland but nothing approaching freedom yet but we really enjoy the grow episodes
[31:29.750 --> 31:35.350]  in particular he also says I'm currently smoking some UK cheese but missing the
[31:35.350 --> 31:38.830]  quality of flower I enjoyed in California he said they were smoking
[31:38.830 --> 31:43.310]  orange a cave from harvest off mission in San Francisco and green crack from
[31:43.310 --> 31:48.550]  kind love in Denver were our favorite flowers we tried ah that green crack
[31:48.550 --> 31:52.830]  from kind love is a great product I actually know the consultant that set
[31:52.830 --> 31:57.830]  that grow up and I have got the same clone of that green crack in my garden
[31:57.830 --> 32:02.990]  at three rivers and it is a great cut so that is quality product kind love is one
[32:02.990 --> 32:07.790]  of my favorite dispensaries in Denver if I were going to go shopping so I'm not
[32:07.790 --> 32:12.310]  bashing kind love they are kind of a premium dispensary they've got some of
[32:12.310 --> 32:15.870]  the higher prices but they've also got some of the better products if I'm
[32:15.870 --> 32:19.550]  looking to spend money for cannabis for a concert and I haven't had a harvest in
[32:19.550 --> 32:24.310]  a while kind love is one of the few places I consider shopping also of
[32:24.310 --> 32:27.590]  course three rivers because I grow that product but if I'm looking to spend too
[32:27.590 --> 32:32.670]  much money kind of love is where I go anyway he says we didn't get around to
[32:32.670 --> 32:37.230]  dabs yet too much gear to sort for tourists yeah I totally understand that
[32:37.230 --> 32:40.990]  the next time you're in Colorado let me know I've got all of the gear you won't
[32:40.990 --> 32:43.870]  have to sort any of it and you won't feel like a tourist you'll feel like
[32:43.870 --> 32:46.950]  you're right at home we'll go to some cool places we'll take some dabs you
[32:46.950 --> 32:51.350]  will have a good time but the email wraps up saying anyway I'll have a smoke
[32:51.350 --> 32:57.590]  and go annoy my mother for you best of luck and big hugs to you and yours hey
[32:57.590 --> 33:00.950]  my friend from Ireland huge thank you for the email huge thank you for the
[33:00.950 --> 33:04.270]  support I really like hearing from my friends in other countries it's neat to
[33:04.270 --> 33:08.710]  know that somebody in Ireland is listening to my podcast right now it's
[33:08.710 --> 33:13.170]  even more neat knowing that you were unable to participate in what I'm
[33:13.170 --> 33:17.050]  teaching you can't grow it's probably hard to consume there you're taking the
[33:17.050 --> 33:20.690]  first steps toward medical but it's extra neat to know that you're listening
[33:20.690 --> 33:24.290]  even though you can't do what I'm saying you're kind of living out the dream
[33:24.290 --> 33:28.050]  vicariously probably a little bit but you're still enjoying the show even
[33:28.050 --> 33:31.010]  though you aren't able to practice what you're being taught which means I'm
[33:31.010 --> 33:34.530]  entertaining you and keeping your attention enough to keep you here even
[33:34.530 --> 33:38.410]  though you can't do the stuff that means a lot to me so thank you for the huge
[33:38.410 --> 33:42.890]  compliment I hope you go annoy your mom for me that sounds great and when you do
[33:42.890 --> 33:46.650]  get some dabs take some giant dabs there or when you come back to the
[33:46.650 --> 33:51.450]  States send me a message and we will take some fat dabs together hey thank
