[00:16.360 --> 00:23.920]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.920 --> 00:28.500]  Today, I'm smoking GG4 Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:28.500 --> 00:36.180]  The label says this product contains 68.8% THC and 79.1% total cannabinoids.
[00:36.180 --> 00:38.300]  I'm a big fan of the GG4.
[00:38.300 --> 00:39.700]  I like the aroma.
[00:39.700 --> 00:43.100]  I like the flavors, and I definitely like the funky buzz that it gives me.
[00:43.100 --> 00:44.420]  It gets my body nice and high.
[00:44.420 --> 00:49.020]  It makes my head nice and stony, and I think it is great podcast concentrates.
[00:49.020 --> 00:54.340]  Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious GG4 Ambrosia.
[00:54.340 --> 00:58.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, in this episode, I am going
[00:58.600 --> 01:03.180]  to talk about some of the mistakes I have made in a grow room, but before we get there,
[01:03.180 --> 01:07.140]  I'd like to give a shout out to a few of our friends from Patreon.

[01:50.000 --> 01:52.680]  past, in the present, and in the future.
[01:52.680 --> 01:56.480]  All right, podcast world. I said that in this episode, we were going to talk about some
[01:56.480 --> 02:00.640]  of the biggest mistakes that I have made in a grow room. Before we get there, I would
[02:00.640 --> 02:05.800]  like to ask you for your email submissions. What are some of the biggest mistakes or what
[02:05.800 --> 02:10.520]  is the biggest mistake you have made in your grow room? Don't be shy. I would love to hear
[02:10.520 --> 02:15.680]  from you. Send me an email. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. Let's talk
[02:15.680 --> 02:19.280]  about some of the biggest mistakes you have made in your grow room.
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.240]  I think by sharing our mistakes, we will do a couple of things. First, we will humble
[02:23.240 --> 02:27.480]  ourselves. We will remind ourselves that we are human and we do fuck up. No matter how
[02:27.480 --> 02:31.440]  much you practice, no matter how good you think you are, no matter how prepared you
[02:31.440 --> 02:35.000]  are, sometimes shit goes wrong and we do make mistakes.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.360]  I also feel like me coming on here and talking about some of the major mistakes I have made
[02:39.360 --> 02:44.480]  as a beginner grower, as an experienced grower, and I've even made mistakes in giant commercial
[02:44.480 --> 02:48.600]  facilities. I feel like coming on here and talking about my mistakes and admitting those
[02:48.920 --> 02:52.600]  mistakes will build a better bond between you and I. It will give you a better trust
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.960]  with me. It will say, hey, that guy was a noob. That guy made mistakes. It will show
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.520]  you that even though you were making mistakes as a newer grower, you still do have the potential
[03:01.520 --> 03:06.680]  to become a great grower. You do have the potential to become a commercial level grower.
[03:06.680 --> 03:11.480]  This episode will build a better bond between us. This episode will help us build confidence.
[03:11.480 --> 03:16.720]  This episode will also humble many growers. Let's talk about some of the mistakes I have
[03:16.720 --> 03:19.480]  made in a grow environment.
[03:19.480 --> 03:23.520]  When I first started growing, I was really into using grow tents. It was a great setup
[03:23.520 --> 03:27.880]  for my environment. It was better than modifying the house in which I lived. So I started with
[03:27.880 --> 03:32.280]  grow tents. I started with one tent, then I expanded to two. Before you knew it, I had
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.800]  a tent with mother plants. I had a tent for vegging, then I had two tents for a perpetual
[03:36.800 --> 03:42.720]  flowering cycle. Most of the time, I did very well taking care of my tents, but those tents
[03:42.720 --> 03:48.080]  led to one of my biggest mistakes. I am not blaming the grow tent in any way. This was
[03:48.080 --> 03:52.440]  all my fault. Let me tell you a little bit about what happened.
[03:52.440 --> 03:56.800]  All of my grow tents were in one big room. I liked starting the day by opening all of
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.480]  the tents. Then I would let the air from the fans blow around the entire room, and they
[04:01.480 --> 04:05.280]  would all get a lot of airflow. I felt like the plants were really happy. They were getting
[04:05.280 --> 04:10.120]  a lot of fresh air. There was no stagnant air. The humidity was just right. The temperature
[04:10.120 --> 04:15.240]  was just right in that entire room. My normal routine for that room was to open all of
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.440]  the tents, water all of the plants, leave the tents open throughout the day so that
[04:19.440 --> 04:23.960]  they could have a lot of nice airflow. Then just before the plants went off for the night,
[04:23.960 --> 04:28.040]  I would go in the room and I would seal up all of the tents. That way my flowering plants
[04:28.040 --> 04:31.600]  wouldn't get any light in. By sealing the other tents, I would make sure that the light
[04:31.600 --> 04:35.800]  wouldn't get out and do another preventative measure to make sure my flowering plants don't
[04:35.800 --> 04:41.080]  receive any light during their night cycle. Most of the time, that plan worked perfectly.
[04:41.080 --> 04:44.920]  I had an alarm set. If the plants were to turn off at 9 o'clock, I would set an alarm
[04:44.920 --> 04:48.680]  for 8.30 so that I could go to the grow space. I could make sure nothing's wrong. If anything
[04:48.680 --> 04:52.800]  needed water, I could water. If anything needed adjustments, I could adjust it. If any equipment
[04:52.800 --> 04:56.160]  was failing, I could see that it was messed up and I could repair it. Then I could close
[04:56.160 --> 05:00.120]  up those tents. The plants would go to sleep, and I could continue with my evening, go to
[05:00.120 --> 05:05.280]  sleep, wake up the next morning, open the tent, and reset the process. One night, I
[05:05.280 --> 05:10.200]  made a huge mistake. I'm sure a lot of you can already tell what I did. I don't remember
[05:10.200 --> 05:15.560]  exactly what happened because it was a long time ago, but I fell asleep with every tent
[05:15.560 --> 05:21.880]  in that grow room open. I woke up several hours after my flowering lights had gone off.
[05:21.880 --> 05:26.880]  I woke up in a panic. I knew immediately that I had fucked up. I ran to the grow room, and
[05:26.880 --> 05:32.080]  just as I had suspected, my flowering lights were off, but the grow tents were all wide
[05:32.080 --> 05:37.720]  open and all of my veg lights were still on. So my flowering plants were now experiencing
[05:37.720 --> 05:41.040]  an interrupted dark cycle.
[05:41.040 --> 05:46.320]  Just in case we have some new growers listening, what I did is a serious mistake. Interrupting
[05:46.320 --> 05:52.680]  the dark cycle at all will create problems in the grow. I interrupted the dark cycle
[05:52.680 --> 05:59.720]  for at least 4-6 hours. So my plants thought that it was daytime for an extra 6 hours that
[05:59.720 --> 06:05.280]  day. This is the exact type of mistake that will cause our plants to hermaphrodite. This
[06:05.280 --> 06:11.600]  is the exact type of mistake that will generate unwanted seeds in our cannabis crop.
[06:11.600 --> 06:16.480]  One of the most important things to a successful seedless cannabis crop is an uninterrupted
[06:16.480 --> 06:23.080]  dark cycle, and I completely fucked that up by falling asleep with my grow tents open.
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.640]  I was still a fairly new and inexperienced grower. I wasn't exactly sure what to do.
[06:27.640 --> 06:32.520]  The only thing I could think of doing was immediately closing up my flowering rooms,
[06:32.520 --> 06:36.720]  closing up those veg rooms, and making sure those plants went back on their regularly
[06:36.720 --> 06:38.600]  scheduled program.
[06:38.600 --> 06:43.280]  I think that I got really lucky that that mistake happened later in flower because I
[06:43.280 --> 06:48.960]  got a few seeds, but I did not ruin the entire crop. If that mistake had happened earlier
[06:48.960 --> 06:55.120]  in flower, I would have ruined an entire crop of cannabis. That entire grow tent, that 5x5
[06:55.120 --> 06:59.560]  grow tent would have been filled with seeded cannabis. I would have wasted all of those
[06:59.560 --> 07:03.680]  plants. I would have wasted all of that soil. I would have wasted all of the nutrients.
[07:03.680 --> 07:07.040]  I would have wasted all of the time that I had put into those plants, and I would have
[07:07.040 --> 07:11.680]  wasted all of the electricity from the lights that I was pumping into those plants. I would
[07:11.680 --> 07:16.120]  have had useless buds at the end, and I would have had a bunch of shitty seeds that nobody
[07:16.120 --> 07:17.120]  wants.
[07:17.120 --> 07:22.560]  So I got really lucky that I made my mistake late enough in flower to not seed my entire
[07:22.560 --> 07:27.800]  crop, but had I made that mistake 10 or 14 days earlier, I could have potentially seeded
[07:27.800 --> 07:33.280]  that entire crop. So as a beginner, that is one of the first major mistakes I do remember
[07:33.280 --> 07:39.160]  making. I fell asleep with my grow tents open, and my veg lights contaminated my flowering
[07:39.160 --> 07:42.480]  cycle, and I got a few seeds in my crop.
[07:42.480 --> 07:45.640]  Now a lot of people may ask, what happened to those seeds? What did you do with those
[07:45.640 --> 07:51.360]  seeds? Those seeds, in my opinion, were undesirable. They were probably thrown away. I really don't
[07:51.360 --> 07:56.520]  like to give away or share seeds that are made on accident. They come from a light contamination.
[07:56.520 --> 08:00.360]  I don't think that is good karma. That is not good practice. Don't give those seeds
[08:00.360 --> 08:04.920]  out. Those are probably trash. If you want to do anything with them, grow them yourself.
[08:04.920 --> 08:06.480]  Don't spread those seeds.
[08:06.480 --> 08:10.240]  And at the time, I was a medical marijuana provider, so I had a couple of people that
[08:10.240 --> 08:13.680]  relied on me for quality products. We had a couple of friends that were a little bit
[08:13.680 --> 08:18.560]  frustrated with me because their medical marijuana supply for the month had seeds in it. They
[08:18.560 --> 08:21.480]  would put their buds in a grinder. They'd grind it up, and they'd hear tink, tink, tink,
[08:21.480 --> 08:24.160]  tink, tink, and they would just look at me like, you fucked up.
[08:24.160 --> 08:29.600]  But I learned. I did make a mistake, and I know now to not fall asleep with my grow room
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.960]  open. So let's talk about another mistake I have made in the grow room. One time, I
[08:34.960 --> 08:39.800]  mixed up a large batch of nutrients that were meant for a flowering room. This flowering
[08:39.800 --> 08:45.600]  room had just been flipped to the flowering phase. In that nutrient mix, I added a product
[08:45.680 --> 08:52.000]  that is used to encourage and promote rapid onset of the flowering phase. That would have
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.440]  been perfect for my freshly flowering plants. It would have sped them up. We would have
[08:56.440 --> 09:00.920]  seen bud set a little bit sooner. That product also slows down the stretch. So I thought
[09:00.920 --> 09:05.240]  I was doing a really good thing. It worked out beautifully. I fed those flowering plants
[09:05.240 --> 09:08.840]  that mix, went about my business. Everything was iry.
[09:08.840 --> 09:13.720]  When I was done watering that flowering room, I mixed up nutrients to water my veg room.
[09:13.720 --> 09:18.840]  I don't know how it happened, but I got mixed up and I used the wrong bucket to water my
[09:18.840 --> 09:25.080]  veg plants. So I accidentally poured that product that is used to initiate flower onto
[09:25.080 --> 09:31.800]  my vegetative plants, which triggered them to flower. So at that point, I had plants
[09:31.800 --> 09:38.220]  underneath a vegetative light in a veg room on a veg schedule that were showing full pre-flower.
[09:38.220 --> 09:43.080]  These plants were starting to show the little dandelion bud sets while they were in veg.
[09:43.080 --> 09:49.080]  That was all caused by one incorrect feed with one incorrect product. It doesn't sound
[09:49.080 --> 09:54.240]  like a big deal that maybe some plants flowered 10, maybe 14 days, maybe 21 days early. But
[09:54.240 --> 09:59.520]  think about this. Where are they going to go? My flowering room is filled. I can't turn
[09:59.520 --> 10:04.320]  my veg room into a flowering room to accommodate these plants because that is where I keep
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.800]  my mother plants.
[10:05.800 --> 10:09.480]  So now I've got plants that are going into flower and I don't have room for them for
[10:09.480 --> 10:14.560]  at least 10, maybe 20 more days, depending on when that crop in front of them finishes.
[10:14.560 --> 10:19.320]  So I was in scramble mode. I had to figure out what to do with my next crop. Was I going
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.040]  to sacrifice that crop because I ruined it? Was I just going to scrap it and throw all
[10:23.040 --> 10:26.840]  those plants away and cut fresh clones and then wait the two weeks for the clones to
[10:26.840 --> 10:31.080]  root and then wait two or three weeks for them to veg to catch up to the size they were?
[10:31.080 --> 10:35.640]  At that rate, I'll fall behind on my perpetual schedule and I won't have plants in the room
[10:35.640 --> 10:38.880]  and I'll have a room empty for two weeks. Then the crop that is supposed to come up
[10:38.880 --> 10:42.680]  right behind that, that is probably already in the cloner is going to be behind. It's
[10:42.680 --> 10:44.720]  going to throw everything off rhythm.
[10:44.720 --> 10:49.480]  So by accidentally feeding my veg plants the wrong nutrients, I fucked everything up in
[10:49.480 --> 10:55.880]  my grow for at least two full cycles. I had to rethink everything. I had to reschedule
[10:55.880 --> 11:00.720]  everything. I had to regroup and start fresh and get a whole new plan for the rest of the
[11:00.720 --> 11:06.280]  year for my grow. And yes, I do have my grow spaces planned out for at least the next six
[11:06.280 --> 11:11.320]  to 12, maybe 18 months. If you are growing on a production schedule, you should know
[11:11.320 --> 11:15.920]  what is happening for at least the next two or three, maybe four or five crops in your
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.560]  grow. When you think about it, a flowering cycle eats up two full months. So you can
[11:20.560 --> 11:26.840]  plan an entire year's worth of growing just by thinking about three to six full cycles.
[11:26.840 --> 11:32.000]  If you are going to run a nine week flowering cycle in your flowering room, you can pull
[11:32.000 --> 11:40.760]  5.7 harvests per year. But that is only going to work if you were on a very tight schedule.
[11:40.760 --> 11:46.400]  If you run a 60 day cycle, you will be able to pull off six full crops, but only if you
[11:46.400 --> 11:49.760]  do not miss one single day in that flowering room.
[11:49.760 --> 11:54.140]  So in my world, scheduling is very important. When it comes to commercial growing, scheduling
[11:54.140 --> 12:00.240]  is extremely important. So that was a huge mistake that I made. I fed my vegetative plants
[12:00.280 --> 12:05.560]  flowering nutrients and it sent those little bitches into flower way too early, which caused
[12:05.560 --> 12:10.520]  chaos in my grow room for at least two more full cycles. So be very careful when you're
[12:10.520 --> 12:14.920]  mixing your nutrients for your plants and pay very close attention to each product you
[12:14.920 --> 12:17.040]  pour into your solution.
[12:17.040 --> 12:20.000]  You guys, this is starting to feel kind of like a confession or something. Like I am
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.520]  over here admitting all of my grow room sins or something. Let's keep going. I do have
[12:24.520 --> 12:28.320]  quite a few more mistakes that we can talk about. Let's talk about a mistake that I have
[12:28.320 --> 12:33.840]  made once or twice and I will never make again. I have made the mistake of getting
[12:33.840 --> 12:38.640]  a clone from either a friend or a dispensary and I brought that clone into my grow room
[12:38.640 --> 12:44.920]  without treating it for every pest and pathogen imaginable. That is a huge mistake. If you
[12:44.920 --> 12:52.120]  ever get a clone from a dispensary or a friend, be sure to treat that clone for every pest
[12:52.120 --> 12:58.120]  and pathogen that you can imagine before introducing that clone to the general population and your
[12:58.440 --> 13:05.440]  grow environment. I strongly recommend treating any incoming plants for pests and pathogens
[13:05.440 --> 13:12.280]  before they are introduced to general population. I suggest keeping any new plants in quarantine
[13:12.280 --> 13:17.440]  for at least a week until you can be sure they are problem free. So whenever you get
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.960]  a new plant, treat it for pests and pathogens. I don't know your integrated pest management
[13:22.960 --> 13:27.720]  program. I don't know how organic you want to be. I don't know how nuclear you want to
[13:27.720 --> 13:33.640]  go. But when you bring in a new clone, I suggest blasting the shit out of it for every
[13:33.640 --> 13:38.960]  problem you can imagine. Treat it like it does have bugs and powdery mildew. Keep that
[13:38.960 --> 13:43.040]  clone away from your mother plants. Keep that clone away from your veg plants. Try to wash
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.680]  your hands and change your clothes before you interact with the rest of your garden
[13:46.680 --> 13:52.480]  until you are certain that that new incoming clone is pest and pathogen free. I like to
[13:52.480 --> 13:57.520]  call that setting yourself up for success. The minute you get that clone is when your
[13:57.520 --> 14:02.700]  success can begin or when your failure can begin. You do have the option to get super
[14:02.700 --> 14:07.080]  excited and race home with your new plant and put it in a new pot so it matches all
[14:07.080 --> 14:11.160]  of your other plants. Put a nice fancy label on it so it's got a cute name on it and then
[14:11.160 --> 14:14.500]  put it right in the grow room right next to all of the other plants so that it can look
[14:14.500 --> 14:18.120]  just like the rest of your garden. Now you're super excited. Look, I just got a brand new
[14:18.120 --> 14:23.320]  cut of this plant. It looks gorgeous. Then about three to five, maybe seven days later,
[14:23.320 --> 14:26.620]  you start noticing that there's some weird shit happening in the grow. Why are these
[14:26.620 --> 14:30.840]  leaves yellow? Why is this plant drooping? What's going on over here? You know what's
[14:30.840 --> 14:34.480]  going on over here? You just brought in russet mites and they came from that clone that you
[14:34.480 --> 14:39.520]  did not quarantine, that clone that you did not spray, that clone that you were not responsible
[14:39.520 --> 14:44.580]  with. So my advice, my guidance to you is to treat every single plant coming into your
[14:44.580 --> 14:51.920]  grow as if it were infested with every bug imaginable and every sort of pathogen imaginable.
[14:51.920 --> 14:56.540]  It is really easy to treat one plant, but it is a pain in the ass to treat the entire
[14:56.540 --> 15:01.600]  garden. So get that one plant, spray the shit out of it, quarantine it, inspect it for four
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.440]  or five, maybe seven to 10 days. And once you are absolutely sure that that plant is
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.960]  clean, put it in general population, let it be a part of the grow. All right, those were
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.900]  some mistakes I made as a rookie grower. Let's move into some things that I have fucked
[15:14.900 --> 15:21.580]  up in a commercial facility. Yes, I am responsible for large commercial facilities. A lot of
[15:21.580 --> 15:26.340]  the facilities I work with have around 100 flowering lights. Some of the facilities I
[15:26.340 --> 15:32.100]  work with have as many as five to 700 flowering lights. That gives me a lot of opportunity
[15:32.100 --> 15:37.460]  to make a lot of mistakes. I do my best to minimize mistakes. I keep a lot of notes and
[15:37.460 --> 15:42.200]  I try to pay a lot of attention and I try to follow a lot of standard operating procedures,
[15:42.200 --> 15:47.120]  but sometimes shit does go wrong. So let's talk about some of the things I have fucked
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.240]  up in a commercial grow facility. It seems to be a tradition that when I take over a
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.800]  new facility, that the way I christen that facility is by flooding the fuck out of that
[15:57.800 --> 16:02.560]  facility. I like to see how much water a building can hold. I like to test the floor drains
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.400]  in a building as soon as I take over. I don't know why, but it seems like as soon as I take
[16:07.400 --> 16:13.200]  over a grow, within the first two or three weeks, I always tend to flood the damn facility.
[16:13.200 --> 16:18.400]  We usually have something like a, usually at least a 100 gallon reservoir, maybe a 250,
[16:18.400 --> 16:23.800]  maybe a 500 gallon. Sometimes we're working with a thousand or a 2,500 gallon reservoir
[16:23.800 --> 16:28.960]  and it takes a really long time to fill those reservoirs. I've got this really good habit
[16:28.960 --> 16:32.680]  of turning on the water and deciding I'm going to go do some other shit while this fills
[16:32.680 --> 16:38.400]  up. And then it feels like it's usually two, three minutes right after that thing is filled.
[16:38.400 --> 16:43.280]  I realized, Hey, I left water on and I've got a thing filling up. And I go running back
[16:43.280 --> 16:47.360]  and guess what? There is a fucking flood in the hallway. That is like my gift. That is
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.320]  one of my super moves. I don't mean to do it. It's usually not that big a deal. You
[16:51.320 --> 16:55.160]  just get a couple of squeegees and a mop and you open the doors, get some fans, just get
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.440]  everything dried. It's just a setback, but it seems to be a tradition. And it's sort
[16:59.440 --> 17:04.240]  of like a way of me. I don't know. Maybe I'm making my mark. Maybe I'm hazing the
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.520]  new facility, but whatever it is, it feels like whenever I get comfortable about that
[17:08.520 --> 17:13.360]  two month mark, I really enjoy just overflowing the reservoir and flooding the shit out of
[17:13.360 --> 17:17.880]  a new facility. Now, it may not sound like overflowing a reservoir is a huge deal to
[17:17.880 --> 17:22.200]  a lot of people, but keep in mind when I work in a commercial facility, some of my water
[17:22.200 --> 17:27.800]  supplies can put out approximately 30 to 50 gallons of water per minute.
[17:27.800 --> 17:33.320]  So I've got the opportunity to put 30 to 50 gallons of water on the floor in as little
[17:33.320 --> 17:39.440]  as one minute. So that can cause a huge problem really quickly. Also, I'm way too experienced
[17:39.440 --> 17:44.640]  and have been doing this way too long to make silly mistakes like overflowing a reservoir.
[17:44.640 --> 17:49.760]  That is day one shit, but for some reason I am still doing it. So that is a major mistake
[17:49.760 --> 17:54.960]  that I have made and it seems like I will continue to make in a commercial environment.
[17:54.960 --> 17:58.240]  Let's talk about one more mistake that I made and then I should wrap this up so that
[17:58.240 --> 18:01.600]  I don't get myself banned from working in the commercial facilities. People are going
[18:01.600 --> 18:05.320]  to be afraid to hire me because they know that I fuck up, but at least I'm not afraid
[18:05.320 --> 18:10.040]  to admit my mistakes. So let's talk about a mistake that I've made on multiple occasions
[18:10.040 --> 18:13.680]  in multiple grow environments. I have done this in home grows. I have done this in small
[18:13.680 --> 18:17.920]  scale commercial environments and I've done this in a large commercial environment. Let's
[18:17.920 --> 18:22.960]  talk about something we like to mess up quite often. In a commercial environment, I suggest
[18:22.960 --> 18:27.600]  using cloning machines and aeroponic type of cloner, the kind that sprays water up from
[18:27.600 --> 18:31.920]  the bottom onto the plants to where it creates nice aerated bubbles. The plants grow a nice
[18:31.920 --> 18:36.020]  roots that dangle down into the water. That is the type of cloner I prefer. Something
[18:36.020 --> 18:40.520]  like an easy cloner or the Botanicare power cloner. Those are my favorites. They're all
[18:40.520 --> 18:45.800]  basically the same, but that is what I recommend in a commercial environment. The mistake I
[18:45.800 --> 18:51.740]  often make with those easy cloner machines is every day at the beginning and the end
[18:51.740 --> 18:56.580]  of the shift, I like to turn the cloner off by unplugging it. Then I lift up the lid and
[18:56.580 --> 19:02.580]  I put a pH meter and an EC meter inside the water. I like to see what my pH is. If my
[19:02.580 --> 19:07.980]  pH is off, I adjust it. I also check and see what the EC of that solution is. If the EC
[19:07.980 --> 19:12.740]  is incorrect, I adjust it. I also check and see that the water level is just to the base
[19:12.740 --> 19:17.740]  of the halo and that the sprayers are not clogged. After I have done my full cloner
[19:17.740 --> 19:22.340]  inspection, I've checked my pH, I've checked my EC, I've made the proper adjustments.
[19:22.340 --> 19:27.420]  At that point, I put the lid back on the cloner and I plug the machine back in and I go about
[19:27.420 --> 19:33.540]  my business. One big mistake that I used to make way too often when doing my cloner inspection
[19:33.540 --> 19:37.260]  was I would check everything, I would do all of my adjustments, I would write everything
[19:37.260 --> 19:41.820]  down, I would put the lid back on the cloner, and then I would walk away without plugging
[19:41.820 --> 19:48.880]  the machine back in. That can be a huge, costly mistake. If I catch that mistake in
[19:48.880 --> 19:54.500]  one hour, I should be okay. If I catch it in two hours, we'll be all right. Three hours,
[19:54.500 --> 19:58.100]  you're kind of pushing your luck. If you don't check on that cloner for four hours, you're
[19:58.100 --> 20:02.400]  going to cause problems. If you don't check on it in five and six hours, shit's going
[20:02.400 --> 20:06.340]  to go wrong. If you don't check on it before you leave the facility for the end of the
[20:06.340 --> 20:10.420]  day and you wait until tomorrow to come back to start the shift, all of your clones are
[20:10.420 --> 20:16.380]  fucking dead. In a commercial environment, we don't cut a couple of clones. In a commercial
[20:16.380 --> 20:23.980]  environment, we generally cut 128 clones at a minimum. My small cloner is 128 sites. I
[20:23.980 --> 20:28.460]  like to fill that. I'm not going to cut half of it. I'm going to fill it up. So if I killed
[20:28.460 --> 20:33.540]  clones, I am probably killing at least 100 clones at a time. Now, what can make this
[20:33.540 --> 20:38.580]  even worse is a lot of times I've had all of my cloning machines plugged into one power
[20:38.580 --> 20:43.500]  strip and I use the on-off switch on that power strip to turn them all off and on during
[20:43.500 --> 20:50.000]  my inspection. Yes, I have plugged in five EZ-Cloners into one power strip. I have gone
[20:50.000 --> 20:55.300]  and done my end of the shift cloner inspection. Everything was legit. I put the lid back on.
[20:55.300 --> 20:59.320]  I wrote down that the pH was correct. I wrote down that the EC was correct. I wrote down
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.220]  that I just added a little bit of clear res because we do that every three to five days
[21:03.220 --> 21:08.020]  to prevent any sort of algae buildup. Then I walked away from all of those cloning machines.
[21:08.060 --> 21:12.500]  I clocked out and I went home for the evening. When I showed up for work the next day, I
[21:12.500 --> 21:18.780]  had five cloning machines full of dead clones. Every single one of them died because I did
[21:18.780 --> 21:24.780]  not turn that power strip back on after I did my cloner inspection. That is a huge and
[21:24.780 --> 21:30.180]  costly mistake. Luckily, those clones were new, so they hadn't started rooting. It only
[21:30.180 --> 21:35.140]  sent me back two or three days. It also sent me back the amount of time that it took me
[21:35.140 --> 21:40.700]  to recut all of those cloners' worth of clones. I basically paid my staff an entire day to
[21:40.700 --> 21:45.340]  cut a bunch of clones so that I could kill them three days later and repay them to recut
[21:45.340 --> 21:50.660]  all of those clones all over again. I'm very lucky that in a commercial environment, I
[21:50.660 --> 21:56.500]  had a lot of very large mother plants to pull those clones from. In a smaller grow environment,
[21:56.500 --> 22:00.460]  your mother plants may not be able to provide enough clones. You may have been shit out
[22:00.460 --> 22:06.620]  of luck in that situation. Be very careful with your cloners. If you're using an easy
[22:06.620 --> 22:11.780]  cloner, if you're using a turbo cloner, an auto cloner, any sort of aero cloner, be sure
[22:11.780 --> 22:17.860]  to turn that thing back on after you make any adjustments. If you're using the old-fashioned
[22:17.860 --> 22:24.540]  trays and plugs and domes, make sure you put that dome back on correctly. If it's got a
[22:24.540 --> 22:28.900]  little gap at the edge, all of your water will escape, your clones will dry out. That's
[22:28.900 --> 22:33.660]  another mistake we can talk about I have made several times in my grow career. Let's
[22:33.660 --> 22:38.380]  talk about leaving the dome off of our clones for way too long. Say you've got a clone dome
[22:38.380 --> 22:42.600]  and it is time to start burping your clones. They are just now developing roots. We want
[22:42.600 --> 22:47.420]  to give them 15 to 30 minutes of fresh air every day. We take that dome off, we let the
[22:47.420 --> 22:51.540]  air blow around, and in about 30 minutes, you go and you put that dome right back on.
[22:51.540 --> 22:56.580]  And then hopefully, your plants start to develop stronger roots. You increase that open interval
[22:56.620 --> 23:01.860]  a little bit over time, then eventually those plants can survive without the dome. One mistake
[23:01.860 --> 23:06.220]  that a lot of people like to make is you take that dome off and you go get stoned and you
[23:06.220 --> 23:10.620]  forget to put the dome back on. You come back like two hours later and your plants are all
[23:10.620 --> 23:16.300]  crispy dead and dry. That is a very simple mistake to make in a grow environment. If
[23:16.300 --> 23:21.020]  you are going to take the dome off of your clones, set a timer. Everybody is addicted
[23:21.020 --> 23:26.380]  to their iPhone. Set a timer on your iPhone. Your phone will set a timer without you pressing
[23:26.380 --> 23:31.420]  any buttons. You can ask your phone to remind you when 15 minutes have passed. You can say,
[23:31.420 --> 23:36.820]  hey Siri, in 15 minutes, remind me to put the lid back on the clones. And she will say,
[23:36.820 --> 23:41.100]  okay, in 15 minutes, I will remind you to put the lid back on the clones and you won't
[23:41.100 --> 23:46.340]  forget. We are all addicted to our phones. Use it to your advantage. So those are a couple
[23:46.340 --> 23:51.140]  of other common mistakes that I am admitting to having done way too often. I have killed
[23:51.140 --> 23:56.140]  clones by not plugging in the clone machine again. And I have killed plenty of clones
[23:56.140 --> 24:01.260]  by not putting the dome back on after their burping period. So don't forget about your
[24:01.260 --> 24:05.740]  clones. Set a timer. Learn from my mistakes. And hopefully you don't have to suffer the
[24:05.740 --> 24:09.180]  same traumatic experiences that I have suffered in my garden.
[24:09.180 --> 24:14.260]  All right, Podcast World, I think that is enough grow room mistake confessions for one
[24:14.260 --> 24:19.540]  episode. I look forward to hearing about your biggest grow room mistakes. Once again, send
[24:19.540 --> 24:25.580]  me an email. My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. I look forward to all of the submissions
[24:25.580 --> 24:30.660]  and I will keep you anonymous. Don't worry. I'm not going to say Bill from St. Louis
[24:30.660 --> 24:34.180]  ruined every grow he ever worked in by doing this. I'm not going to do that to you. I will
[24:34.180 --> 24:38.420]  keep your identity secret. I will keep you anonymous. I'm not trying to embarrass anybody
[24:38.420 --> 24:44.580]  by doing an episode about people's mistakes. My goal here is to help other growers to not
[24:44.580 --> 24:49.060]  make these same mistakes that other people have made. And maybe if we tell them the mistakes
[24:49.060 --> 24:53.300]  that we've ran into, the problems we've experienced, we can give them a little bit of warning and
[24:53.300 --> 24:57.380]  they'll look out and not make the same mistakes that we are making. My ultimate goal here
[24:57.380 --> 25:02.740]  in this episode and in this entire podcast is to make everybody's grow experience more
[25:02.740 --> 25:07.900]  enjoyable and to improve the quality of everybody's overall finished product.
[25:07.900 --> 25:13.180]  All right, Podcast World, I'm going to start wrapping up this podcast while I'm still employable.
