[00:14.720 --> 00:17.400]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:17.400 --> 00:19.320]  It's time for episode number 225
[00:19.320 --> 00:21.200]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.200 --> 00:24.960]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.960 --> 00:26.160]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:26.160 --> 00:27.500]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.500 --> 00:30.000]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.560]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.880]  or even someone who's curious
[00:32.880 --> 00:34.640]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.640 --> 00:37.520]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.520 --> 00:39.480]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.440]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:41.440 --> 00:43.720]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.720 --> 00:45.360]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:45.360 --> 00:47.840]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.840 --> 00:49.680]  Big shout out to Kat, Koo,
[00:49.680 --> 00:51.900]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.560 --> 00:55.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I just took a giant dab
[00:55.520 --> 00:57.480]  of some Lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid
[00:57.480 --> 00:59.240]  full spectrum extract.
[00:59.240 --> 01:02.720]  I dunked that into the Lemon Jeffrey high terpene
[01:02.720 --> 01:04.560]  full spectrum extract.
[01:04.560 --> 01:06.880]  Just taking a dab, everything was going well.
[01:06.880 --> 01:07.960]  And right toward the end of the dab,
[01:07.960 --> 01:10.120]  I just started fucking sneezing.
[01:10.120 --> 01:11.440]  And I don't know what happened.
[01:11.440 --> 01:12.880]  I sneezed about 12 times in a row.
[01:12.880 --> 01:14.060]  The smoke came out of my ears.
[01:14.060 --> 01:15.160]  The smoke came out of my eyes.
[01:15.160 --> 01:17.720]  I felt like the smoke came out of my nose.
[01:17.720 --> 01:19.920]  It really was kinda not pleasant
[01:19.920 --> 01:20.840]  for a couple of seconds there.
[01:20.840 --> 01:22.300]  My face feels all swollen and puffy,
[01:22.300 --> 01:24.280]  like after you sneeze a whole bunch.
[01:24.280 --> 01:26.700]  But the good side is I feel super medicated.
[01:26.700 --> 01:29.240]  My head is very mellow after that.
[01:29.240 --> 01:31.360]  This should be a fun intro.
[01:31.360 --> 01:32.680]  I hope everybody had a good 7-10.
[01:32.680 --> 01:33.520]  I know I did.
[01:33.520 --> 01:34.800]  I took some fat dabs.
[01:34.800 --> 01:36.600]  I did not give your mom a hug for me though.
[01:36.600 --> 01:37.480]  I will next time.
[01:38.600 --> 01:40.520]  All right, let's get this podcast on the road.
[01:40.520 --> 01:41.520]  You guys, it has been hot.
[01:41.520 --> 01:43.000]  I hope you've been dealing with the heat.
[01:43.000 --> 01:44.720]  Hope everything's been going well in your garden.
[01:44.720 --> 01:46.720]  Hope the air conditioner is holding up.
[01:46.720 --> 01:47.800]  Hope your brain hasn't melted.
[01:47.800 --> 01:48.920]  I hope you're staying hydrated.
[01:48.920 --> 01:49.760]  Be careful out there.
[01:49.760 --> 01:51.840]  If you're going to any festivals or anything,
[01:51.840 --> 01:53.080]  stay hydrated.
[01:53.080 --> 01:54.880]  If you were at Chalice, I hope you survived.
[01:54.880 --> 01:56.820]  Big ups if you survived Chalice.
[01:56.820 --> 01:59.380]  Chalice was a festival, a hash music and art festival,
[01:59.380 --> 02:01.720]  hosted by our friends at Hitman Glass.
[02:01.720 --> 02:04.640]  I was out in a northern part of California.
[02:04.640 --> 02:06.960]  I wanna say Oxnard, but I could be wrong.
[02:06.960 --> 02:10.680]  I was seeing people posting pictures of 110, 112,
[02:10.720 --> 02:14.160]  and I think somebody posted 118 degrees out there.
[02:14.160 --> 02:16.240]  People were out there smoking hash and watching music
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.400]  and having a good time.
[02:18.880 --> 02:19.920]  Better people than me.
[02:19.920 --> 02:20.760]  Fuck that.
[02:20.760 --> 02:22.280]  I don't wanna go play when it's 118 degrees.
[02:22.280 --> 02:24.200]  All I wanna do is turn on the air conditioner
[02:24.200 --> 02:25.320]  and stay the fuck inside.
[02:25.320 --> 02:27.340]  I don't even wanna mess around with 118.
[02:27.340 --> 02:30.040]  That does not sound like a good idea at all.
[02:30.040 --> 02:31.560]  I am super pale.
[02:31.560 --> 02:32.880]  For some reason, when I go out in the sun,
[02:32.880 --> 02:34.720]  I'm like, I'm almost gingery.
[02:34.720 --> 02:37.280]  My beard comes in red, but my hair is blonde.
[02:37.280 --> 02:38.960]  But when I go out in the sun, I just burn.
[02:38.960 --> 02:39.960]  I just roast.
[02:39.960 --> 02:43.000]  I'll turn bright red, and then I'll peel sometimes.
[02:43.000 --> 02:44.760]  And then the next day, I'm not even suntanned anymore.
[02:44.760 --> 02:45.600]  So it's kinda shitty.
[02:45.600 --> 02:46.600]  I don't get a suntan or anything.
[02:46.600 --> 02:50.680]  I just go from white to lobster red to peel to nothing.
[02:54.070 --> 02:55.670]  All right, I'm already off to a good ramble.
[02:55.670 --> 02:57.950]  This should be a good podcast.
[02:57.950 --> 03:00.870]  Let's see, let's get into a little bit of a breeding update.
[03:00.870 --> 03:02.190]  I keep talking about the breeding project
[03:02.190 --> 03:03.790]  I'm currently working on.
[03:03.790 --> 03:04.830]  If you guys know anything about me,
[03:04.830 --> 03:06.510]  you know I'm working with an Arise male.
[03:06.510 --> 03:08.510]  Arise is a golden goat female
[03:08.510 --> 03:11.710]  pollinated by a Daybreaker male.
[03:11.710 --> 03:15.310]  The Arise progeny has tested in the high 20s
[03:15.310 --> 03:18.510]  and low 30s in THC very consistently.
[03:18.510 --> 03:21.210]  Shout out to our friends at Organtica in New Mexico.
[03:21.210 --> 03:22.470]  They grow the Arise.
[03:22.470 --> 03:25.430]  So far, they have tested the highest I've ever seen it test.
[03:25.430 --> 03:28.270]  They tested at 35% THC.
[03:28.270 --> 03:30.630]  That's the highest that I've ever seen steep hill test.
[03:30.630 --> 03:33.590]  So big love to our friends at Organtica.
[03:33.590 --> 03:35.750]  So I'm using a male from the Arise.
[03:35.750 --> 03:36.750]  His name is Solomon.
[03:36.790 --> 03:38.910]  I named him King Solomon.
[03:38.910 --> 03:43.750]  On June 18th, I used King Solomon to pollinate
[03:43.750 --> 03:48.350]  a red-headed stranger, a protagium from Ethos Genetics,
[03:48.350 --> 03:51.690]  a Flo, Kalonji Kush, Grateful Dog.
[03:51.690 --> 03:53.090]  We got Helzeo G in there.
[03:53.090 --> 03:54.950]  There's a Lemon Skunk in there.
[03:54.950 --> 03:58.710]  Capleton, Jeff's OG, White Widow, Platinum Tangy,
[03:58.710 --> 04:01.550]  Chem 4, Jack Flash, Critical Mass,
[04:01.550 --> 04:03.330]  and a whole bunch of other stuff.
[04:03.330 --> 04:05.310]  Anyway, I pollinated them on the 18th.
[04:05.310 --> 04:07.790]  Today it is, let's look down and see what the date is.
[04:07.790 --> 04:10.350]  Today is 7-13 as I record.
[04:10.350 --> 04:13.070]  So that means they were pollinated almost a month ago.
[04:13.070 --> 04:14.110]  The seeds are forming.
[04:14.110 --> 04:15.030]  The seeds are fat.
[04:15.030 --> 04:16.990]  I can see the seeds in the buds.
[04:16.990 --> 04:19.390]  You don't need any sort of assistance to see them.
[04:19.390 --> 04:22.470]  The buds are swollen up with seeds.
[04:22.470 --> 04:25.070]  That was harder to say than it looked.
[04:25.070 --> 04:26.270]  But I'm very excited.
[04:26.270 --> 04:29.150]  They should be done somewhere between two and four weeks.
[04:29.150 --> 04:31.110]  I'm probably gonna let them go the full four weeks
[04:31.110 --> 04:32.550]  to make sure that they are done.
[04:32.550 --> 04:34.310]  The only problem with letting seeds go too long
[04:34.350 --> 04:36.070]  is sometimes they get a little too hard
[04:36.070 --> 04:37.930]  and they don't germinate well.
[04:37.930 --> 04:39.710]  None of these that are being made out of this batch
[04:39.710 --> 04:40.570]  are going to market.
[04:40.570 --> 04:42.090]  These are all for myself.
[04:42.090 --> 04:43.550]  I've got plenty of other things
[04:43.550 --> 04:45.550]  that are available for market.
[04:45.550 --> 04:47.190]  But yeah, that's where this breeding project is.
[04:47.190 --> 04:49.290]  Honestly, something, I don't know why,
[04:49.290 --> 04:51.930]  I was really excited about the Platinum Tangy to Arise.
[04:51.930 --> 04:53.930]  I wanna put that orange flavor.
[04:53.930 --> 04:56.190]  But since I've been watching it happen,
[04:56.190 --> 04:58.690]  the Chem 4 Arise combination
[04:58.690 --> 05:01.110]  has just been making me more and more excited.
[05:01.110 --> 05:02.550]  And also I'm growing the Chem 4
[05:02.550 --> 05:04.450]  in the commercial grow at Three Rivers,
[05:04.450 --> 05:07.630]  and it just gets huge and chunky and stinks.
[05:07.630 --> 05:08.790]  So it's been getting me excited.
[05:08.790 --> 05:10.990]  So I'm excited about the Arise to Chem 4.
[05:10.990 --> 05:13.130]  But there's gonna be a lot of cool new shit coming up.
[05:13.130 --> 05:14.030]  The seeds are getting huge.
[05:14.030 --> 05:14.950]  You can see them in there, you guys.
[05:14.950 --> 05:16.790]  They're not quite turning dark yet.
[05:16.790 --> 05:19.990]  They're white and they're going kind of grayish.
[05:19.990 --> 05:22.030]  They'll go white and then kind of this grayish color,
[05:22.030 --> 05:23.390]  and then they'll turn to green,
[05:23.390 --> 05:25.070]  and then they'll start turning that tiger stripe thing.
[05:25.070 --> 05:26.230]  And that's when they're done.
[05:26.230 --> 05:28.630]  They're kind of doing the first transition part.
[05:28.630 --> 05:29.870]  They're getting there.
[05:29.990 --> 05:32.950]  They're almost starting to be like real seeds.
[05:32.950 --> 05:35.390]  All right, so that's an update on the breeding project.
[05:35.390 --> 05:37.030]  Thanks for paying attention to the breeding project.
[05:37.030 --> 05:39.390]  Also, huge thanks to everybody
[05:39.390 --> 05:43.190]  who have been sending me strain name ideas.
[05:43.190 --> 05:45.730]  I'm working on new strains all the time.
[05:45.730 --> 05:48.270]  I have a couple of new strains that could use names.
[05:48.270 --> 05:51.430]  Those strains have been Flow, Cross to the Arise,
[05:51.430 --> 05:53.630]  and of course White Widow, Cross to Arise.
[05:53.630 --> 05:54.830]  People have been sending in names.
[05:54.830 --> 05:57.570]  I think I've decided the name for Flow to Arise.
[05:57.570 --> 06:00.490]  White Widow to Arise does not have a name yet.
[06:00.490 --> 06:02.870]  If you've got any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
[06:02.870 --> 06:05.050]  You can tweet me at GFYH podcast.
[06:05.050 --> 06:06.450]  Of course, you can send me an email.
[06:06.450 --> 06:08.690]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:08.690 --> 06:10.290]  You can also find me on Instagram.
[06:10.290 --> 06:13.330]  It's irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[06:13.330 --> 06:14.270]  All right, that's enough of that.
[06:14.270 --> 06:15.450]  Let's move forward a little bit.
[06:15.450 --> 06:16.290]  Where do we go next?
[06:16.290 --> 06:17.330]  Patreon.
[06:17.330 --> 06:18.570]  Holy crap, you guys.
[06:18.570 --> 06:21.950]  Huge thank you to everybody who contributed to the Patreon
[06:21.950 --> 06:23.850]  in the past and in the present.
[06:23.850 --> 06:26.450]  This month was a great month for Patreon.
[06:26.450 --> 06:27.890]  If you don't know what Patreon is,
[06:27.890 --> 06:29.290]  let me explain it to you.
[06:29.290 --> 06:31.890]  Patreon is a service that allows you as a listener
[06:31.890 --> 06:33.970]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[06:33.970 --> 06:35.410]  That's right, if you feel like this podcast
[06:35.410 --> 06:37.190]  was worth a couple of bucks of your time,
[06:37.190 --> 06:40.570]  you can go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart,
[06:40.570 --> 06:41.790]  and you can learn how to sign up
[06:41.790 --> 06:43.450]  to contribute to the podcast.
[06:43.450 --> 06:44.770]  I'm not begging for money,
[06:44.770 --> 06:47.150]  but if you feel like the show was worth a couple of bucks,
[06:47.150 --> 06:48.850]  I would love it if you threw them my direction.
[06:48.850 --> 06:50.890]  What I will do with those couple of dollars
[06:50.890 --> 06:53.290]  is I will keep my website up that hosts this podcast.
[06:53.290 --> 06:55.810]  My website is iriegeneticscolorado.com.
[06:55.810 --> 06:57.610]  It looks like shit right now, I apologize.
[06:57.610 --> 07:00.210]  I focus more on the podcast and more on my grows
[07:00.210 --> 07:01.550]  than I do the website.
[07:01.550 --> 07:05.310]  But the point is, the webpage is where the podcast is hosted
[07:05.310 --> 07:07.170]  so I have to keep the webpage alive,
[07:07.170 --> 07:08.730]  and that's where the podcast goes.
[07:08.730 --> 07:10.050]  It goes into an RSS feed,
[07:10.050 --> 07:11.490]  then it ends up in iTunes and Stitcher
[07:11.490 --> 07:13.570]  so that you're able to listen to it for free.
[07:13.570 --> 07:14.730]  All I'm asking for is help
[07:14.730 --> 07:16.730]  in covering the cost of my website.
[07:16.730 --> 07:18.730]  I also buy these little foam microphone covers
[07:18.730 --> 07:20.090]  for when people come over.
[07:20.090 --> 07:21.170]  I do a few other things.
[07:21.170 --> 07:22.990]  I buy water bottles for everybody.
[07:22.990 --> 07:24.730]  I also dab everybody the fuck out.
[07:24.730 --> 07:27.070]  So I'm just looking for a little financial help
[07:27.070 --> 07:28.730]  for the things that I've spent on the podcast
[07:28.730 --> 07:30.330]  so it doesn't all come out of my pocket.
[07:30.330 --> 07:31.270]  If you guys can't contribute,
[07:31.270 --> 07:32.930]  I will continue to do it out of my pocket
[07:32.930 --> 07:34.730]  because I fucking love podcasting,
[07:34.730 --> 07:36.850]  I love cannabis, and I love you guys.
[07:36.850 --> 07:38.810]  So if you wanna learn how to contribute,
[07:38.810 --> 07:42.250]  simply go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[07:42.250 --> 07:46.370]  And Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N,
[07:46.370 --> 07:49.370]  patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[07:49.370 --> 07:50.450]  And once again, huge thank you
[07:50.450 --> 07:51.970]  to everybody who has contributed.
[07:51.970 --> 07:53.890]  And if you can't contribute, don't feel bad.
[07:53.890 --> 07:55.450]  I still want you to listen to this podcast.
[07:55.450 --> 07:56.810]  There are just a few people out there
[07:56.810 --> 07:58.330]  that have asked how they can help out,
[07:58.330 --> 07:59.690]  and now they've got a way to do it.
[07:59.690 --> 08:01.170]  So thank you.
[08:01.170 --> 08:03.450]  All right, moving forward, I've got a little teaser.
[08:03.450 --> 08:06.090]  I was contacted by a company called PL Grow,
[08:06.090 --> 08:07.930]  and they are going to send us a product
[08:07.930 --> 08:09.450]  to review on the show.
[08:09.450 --> 08:11.850]  The product is coming all the way from Australia,
[08:11.850 --> 08:13.470]  so it's gonna be a little while,
[08:13.470 --> 08:15.130]  but I am excited to get the product,
[08:15.130 --> 08:16.490]  I'm excited to test it out,
[08:16.490 --> 08:19.570]  and then I'm even more excited to get behind the microphone
[08:19.570 --> 08:22.570]  and tell you guys all about what these people sent me.
[08:22.570 --> 08:25.050]  So big shout out to our friends at PL Grow.
[08:25.050 --> 08:28.930]  I really look forward to the box from Australia.
[08:28.930 --> 08:30.490]  All right, you guys, I'm gonna press pause here.
[08:30.490 --> 08:31.330]  I need to take a drink.
[08:31.330 --> 08:32.390]  My throat's already doing that thing
[08:32.390 --> 08:33.490]  where it sounds like shit.
[08:33.490 --> 08:36.010]  So I'm gonna press pause, I'm gonna take a drink.
[08:36.010 --> 08:37.170]  Yep, see, there it goes.
[08:37.170 --> 08:39.730]  And of course, I'm gonna take a couple of gigantic dabs,
[08:39.730 --> 08:40.570]  and then I'll be right back,
[08:40.570 --> 08:42.890]  and we're going to read some emails from our friends.
[08:42.890 --> 08:46.170]  Our first email is going to be about trellising
[08:46.170 --> 08:49.170]  a commercial grow in a perpetual cycle,
[08:49.170 --> 08:50.070]  and then we have another email
[08:50.070 --> 08:51.510]  that goes right along with that.
[08:51.510 --> 08:53.610]  So stick around, take a couple of dabs,
[08:53.610 --> 08:54.930]  and I'll be right back.
[08:56.510 --> 08:58.230]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[08:58.230 --> 09:01.290]  I just took a gigantic dab of some, what was this?
[09:01.290 --> 09:03.310]  It was strawberry, I don't wanna say the wrong thing.
[09:03.310 --> 09:05.790]  It was strawberry icy ambrosia
[09:05.790 --> 09:07.750]  from our friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[09:07.750 --> 09:10.670]  I ended up to Apothecary on Ambrosia days.
[09:10.670 --> 09:12.590]  I got to see some cool glass blowing.
[09:12.590 --> 09:14.190]  Shout out to our friends at The Glass Grind.
[09:14.190 --> 09:15.110]  What's up, Logan?
[09:15.110 --> 09:16.490]  Thanks for letting me watch you blow glass, dude.
[09:16.490 --> 09:17.910]  That was cool.
[09:17.910 --> 09:20.030]  Man, it was 100 degrees that day.
[09:20.030 --> 09:21.470]  It was super sunshiny.
[09:22.310 --> 09:25.030]  Dude had a tent, a little booth set up with two torches.
[09:25.030 --> 09:28.070]  There were actually two, Elevate had a booth there also.
[09:28.070 --> 09:30.430]  And occasionally these guys would fire up their torches
[09:30.430 --> 09:33.390]  and blow glass, and I couldn't even go near the damn booth
[09:33.390 --> 09:34.470]  when they were working the glass,
[09:34.470 --> 09:36.130]  because it was so hot.
[09:36.130 --> 09:37.350]  Shout out to all the glass workers
[09:37.350 --> 09:40.230]  who were doing glass in the fucking heat.
[09:40.230 --> 09:42.570]  You're a tougher man than me, and woman.
[09:42.570 --> 09:44.470]  There was a woman glass blower also.
[09:44.470 --> 09:46.470]  Mad respect for the people out there in the fucking heat
[09:46.470 --> 09:48.430]  working behind a torch, not me.
[09:48.430 --> 09:51.230]  But anyway, I went to the Ambrosia days on,
[09:51.990 --> 09:53.990]  it was 7-9 the day before 7-10,
[09:53.990 --> 09:55.510]  and we picked up some pretty stylish hash.
[09:55.510 --> 09:57.710]  I got some, I think one of my favorites was honestly
[09:57.710 --> 10:01.390]  this strawberry icy, and I was pleasantly surprised
[10:01.390 --> 10:03.790]  by some Killer Queen Ambrosia,
[10:03.790 --> 10:07.390]  and also the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[10:07.390 --> 10:10.650]  We got some Clementine, I got the Clementine,
[10:10.650 --> 10:12.990]  the Ambrosia, and also some Clementine turps,
[10:12.990 --> 10:14.870]  and some Clementine, I think there was some
[10:14.870 --> 10:17.590]  high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[10:17.590 --> 10:18.890]  There was a bunch of great stuff there.
[10:18.890 --> 10:19.990]  I got a bunch of great things.
[10:19.990 --> 10:22.030]  I've honestly been sitting on a bunch of this
[10:22.030 --> 10:24.750]  lemon Jeffrey high cannabinoid full spectrum extract,
[10:24.750 --> 10:28.070]  been saving it for 7-10, and I've got one gram of it left,
[10:28.070 --> 10:29.990]  and I don't want to smoke it.
[10:29.990 --> 10:31.670]  My next things I'll be smoking,
[10:31.670 --> 10:34.550]  I'm gonna finish this strawberry icy Ambrosia,
[10:34.550 --> 10:37.130]  and this Killer Queen high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[10:37.130 --> 10:39.310]  probably by the end of tonight.
[10:39.310 --> 10:41.950]  And then I'll be out of all my 7-10 fancy goodies.
[10:44.110 --> 10:45.750]  Come on Apothecary, have another sale.
[10:45.750 --> 10:46.750]  I'll have to go back up there
[10:46.750 --> 10:48.350]  and get myself some more goodies.
[10:48.350 --> 10:49.190]  Shout out to Cooper.
[10:49.190 --> 10:51.710]  What up Coop, I saw you up there at the Ambrosia days.
[10:51.710 --> 10:53.030]  Good talking to you.
[10:53.030 --> 10:54.950]  Coop had a little surgery.
[10:54.950 --> 10:57.650]  It's good to hear your taint is doing well, my friend.
[10:58.670 --> 11:00.310]  All right, that got weird super fast.
[11:00.310 --> 11:02.110]  As soon as I said taint, I regretted it,
[11:02.110 --> 11:04.070]  but I'm not going to edit that out.
[11:04.070 --> 11:06.910]  Let's move forward and work on some emails.
[11:06.910 --> 11:09.510]  I've been getting a lot of great emails from listeners,
[11:09.510 --> 11:13.110]  and I love doing shows based on listener content.
[11:13.110 --> 11:14.790]  That lets me know that I'm hitting my target.
[11:14.790 --> 11:17.030]  It lets me know I'm helping at least one person.
[11:17.030 --> 11:18.150]  So if you've got a question,
[11:18.150 --> 11:19.670]  or if you need some guidance on a grow,
[11:19.670 --> 11:21.790]  or want to know something about cannabis,
[11:21.790 --> 11:23.790]  I would love the opportunity to help you out.
[11:23.790 --> 11:24.630]  Send me your email.
[11:24.630 --> 11:27.590]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com,
[11:27.590 --> 11:29.690]  and I will read your email on a future episode.
[11:29.690 --> 11:31.150]  I know a lot of people have sent me emails,
[11:31.150 --> 11:32.390]  and they're going to say, what the hell, dude?
[11:32.390 --> 11:33.750]  I sent you a message a long time ago.
[11:33.750 --> 11:34.590]  You still haven't read it.
[11:34.590 --> 11:35.730]  I get a lot of emails.
[11:35.730 --> 11:37.550]  Like I said, I'm working my way through it,
[11:37.550 --> 11:38.370]  and I'm getting caught up.
[11:38.370 --> 11:39.210]  Now that I bought the printer,
[11:39.210 --> 11:40.850]  and I've been printing out the messages,
[11:40.850 --> 11:41.830]  it's so much easier.
[11:41.830 --> 11:43.830]  So your chances are getting much higher
[11:43.830 --> 11:45.950]  that your message will be read on the show.
[11:45.950 --> 11:48.710]  So let's start with this one right here.
[11:48.710 --> 11:51.150]  This one comes from a person who calls themselves Aaron,
[11:51.150 --> 11:53.570]  and they say, you can use my name.
[11:53.570 --> 11:55.150]  The message goes like this.
[11:55.150 --> 11:57.030]  Hi there, I recently found your podcast,
[11:57.030 --> 11:59.830]  and is now part of my daily work routine.
[11:59.830 --> 12:02.710]  I actually work on a commercial rec grow in Oregon,
[12:02.710 --> 12:04.790]  and introduced it to a few of my coworkers.
[12:04.790 --> 12:05.810]  Hey, thank you, man.
[12:05.810 --> 12:07.590]  I love it when people share the podcast.
[12:07.590 --> 12:08.770]  Hopefully those people listen,
[12:08.770 --> 12:10.470]  and then hopefully they share it with somebody else,
[12:10.470 --> 12:12.630]  and the podcast grows and grows and grows.
[12:12.630 --> 12:13.470]  That's how it works.
[12:13.470 --> 12:14.790]  So thank you for that.
[12:14.790 --> 12:16.290]  Then he says, now onto the questions.
[12:16.290 --> 12:19.750]  I've got a bunch, but we'll only throw a few at you now.
[12:19.750 --> 12:21.830]  Hey, I look forward to the other questions, Aaron.
[12:21.830 --> 12:23.470]  You say you've got more questions.
[12:23.470 --> 12:25.270]  I wanna hear them, so shoot them my way.
[12:25.270 --> 12:27.830]  Then you say, recently you talked about doing a scrog,
[12:27.830 --> 12:30.630]  a screen of green in your commercial grows.
[12:30.630 --> 12:33.230]  How do you work that into a perpetual cycle?
[12:33.230 --> 12:36.510]  Also, I'm having issues with russet mites and root aphids.
[12:36.510 --> 12:37.870]  What can I do to get rid of them?
[12:37.870 --> 12:39.670]  The more organic, the better.
[12:39.670 --> 12:41.270]  Could you also point me in the direction
[12:41.270 --> 12:44.250]  of where to find a Grokashi bucket, or how to make one?
[12:44.690 --> 12:46.130]  Much thanks from Aaron.
[12:46.130 --> 12:48.210]  You can use my name.
[12:48.210 --> 12:50.410]  All right, now the first question is,
[12:50.410 --> 12:52.610]  how do you work that screen of green
[12:52.610 --> 12:55.210]  into a perpetual cycle?
[12:55.210 --> 12:56.890]  It depends on how you're doing the perpetual.
[12:56.890 --> 12:59.810]  The way that I do it in the Grow at Three Rivers
[12:59.810 --> 13:01.890]  is we've got three separate rooms
[13:01.890 --> 13:03.610]  that are used for flower rooms.
[13:03.610 --> 13:06.730]  So we veg in one room, and then we move the plants
[13:06.730 --> 13:08.810]  to the flower room, and I like to leave them
[13:08.810 --> 13:12.030]  in the flower room for about a week before I flip them.
[13:12.030 --> 13:13.690]  So they go in there.
[13:13.730 --> 13:16.130]  The day they get moved into the flower room,
[13:16.130 --> 13:17.650]  they get trellised.
[13:17.650 --> 13:18.650]  They get scrogged out.
[13:18.650 --> 13:20.670]  We put the screen up the minute those plants
[13:20.670 --> 13:21.670]  are done being moved in.
[13:21.670 --> 13:22.610]  That's the next step.
[13:22.610 --> 13:25.530]  Once they're in there, we just start scrogging.
[13:25.530 --> 13:28.810]  And then we put the scrog kind of low.
[13:28.810 --> 13:31.130]  So we honestly lower the plants anywhere
[13:31.130 --> 13:33.450]  from four to six inches lower than what they were
[13:33.450 --> 13:34.390]  with that first scrog.
[13:34.390 --> 13:35.730]  Just bring them down right away.
[13:35.730 --> 13:38.450]  Spread them apart and lower them down.
[13:38.450 --> 13:40.490]  So the way we're doing it is we're doing
[13:40.490 --> 13:41.690]  the whole room at one time.
[13:41.690 --> 13:43.330]  That's what's making it work.
[13:43.970 --> 13:44.850]  We move it all into there.
[13:44.850 --> 13:47.650]  Then we scrog it on day one and pull it all down
[13:47.650 --> 13:49.330]  and let it grow.
[13:49.330 --> 13:51.910]  Then we flip it a week later, and then about two,
[13:51.910 --> 13:54.730]  maybe three weeks after that, we throw on the second net.
[13:54.730 --> 13:56.730]  And then sometimes two or three weeks after that,
[13:56.730 --> 13:57.850]  we throw on a third net.
[13:57.850 --> 14:00.090]  So that's basically how we're able to do it
[14:00.090 --> 14:02.230]  in a perpetual grow.
[14:02.230 --> 14:06.050]  If you're doing more than one phase in a tray
[14:06.050 --> 14:08.370]  or one area, it's gonna be really hard to scrog.
[14:08.370 --> 14:10.210]  That's gonna be a real bitch.
[14:10.210 --> 14:13.970]  Unless you learn how to never cut the screen down.
[14:13.970 --> 14:16.050]  When we harvest, we cut the screen out.
[14:16.050 --> 14:18.210]  So everything just comes down.
[14:18.210 --> 14:20.210]  You may have to use something a little more rigid
[14:20.210 --> 14:21.050]  than a net.
[14:21.050 --> 14:23.450]  They sell plastic screens that you can use
[14:23.450 --> 14:26.610]  or chicken wire or something so that you can manipulate
[14:26.610 --> 14:27.450]  the plants through there.
[14:27.450 --> 14:28.970]  And then when you harvest one section,
[14:28.970 --> 14:30.710]  you don't have to cut the net down.
[14:30.710 --> 14:32.330]  But that's gonna be a real bitch.
[14:32.330 --> 14:34.490]  The only way, I can't say the only,
[14:34.490 --> 14:35.970]  because there are always options.
[14:35.970 --> 14:39.610]  The way it works for us is by doing whole sections
[14:40.050 --> 14:41.170]  or whole rooms at one time.
[14:41.170 --> 14:43.630]  I wouldn't recommend trying, so if you have a tray,
[14:43.630 --> 14:46.050]  like an eight by four tray, I wouldn't try to do
[14:46.050 --> 14:48.810]  one side 30 days ahead of the other and try to scrog it.
[14:48.810 --> 14:50.130]  That's gonna fucking suck.
[14:50.130 --> 14:53.170]  I would get another tray or I would just do a bigger room
[14:53.170 --> 14:56.250]  and I would do two separate sections for scrog.
[14:56.250 --> 14:58.890]  Maybe you want two five by five tables
[14:58.890 --> 15:01.530]  instead of one five by 10 or two four by fours
[15:01.530 --> 15:03.750]  instead of one four by eight to scrog like that.
[15:03.750 --> 15:05.890]  It would just be easier in my opinion.
[15:05.890 --> 15:08.130]  So the way that we do it for a perpetual cycle
[15:08.130 --> 15:10.010]  is I move them into the flower room,
[15:10.010 --> 15:12.450]  I scrog them that day, they veg for a week,
[15:12.450 --> 15:13.490]  then they flip.
[15:13.490 --> 15:15.890]  About two weeks later, another net.
[15:15.890 --> 15:18.690]  The first net of scrog is to spread them out.
[15:18.690 --> 15:21.350]  The plants are tall, they just go straight up.
[15:21.350 --> 15:23.650]  I put that net on there and I just pull them down
[15:23.650 --> 15:25.770]  and I double their width and I lower them
[15:25.770 --> 15:27.410]  by about four to six inches.
[15:27.410 --> 15:29.770]  So they're just, put your arms straight up in the air.
[15:29.770 --> 15:31.130]  Now imagine if somebody just grabbed your arms
[15:31.130 --> 15:32.730]  and pulled them down and made a Y,
[15:32.730 --> 15:33.770]  and made your Y wider.
[15:33.770 --> 15:35.050]  That's what I do to the plants.
[15:35.050 --> 15:37.230]  Just give them, go from a Y to a T
[15:37.230 --> 15:38.310]  and now they start growing up.
[15:38.310 --> 15:39.710]  Maybe if you turn your wrists up,
[15:39.710 --> 15:41.670]  that's what they start doing.
[15:41.670 --> 15:43.990]  They just start shooting up from there.
[15:43.990 --> 15:45.670]  By week two, they need a trellis.
[15:45.670 --> 15:47.710]  The second trellis is just to support the buds
[15:47.710 --> 15:48.750]  because now the buds are growing.
[15:48.750 --> 15:51.230]  It's to give them a little support, kind of hold them up.
[15:51.230 --> 15:53.470]  Then the third one is for those giant donkey dick buds
[15:53.470 --> 15:54.530]  that just start flopping over.
[15:54.530 --> 15:56.550]  I like to just put that third trellis in there.
[15:56.550 --> 15:57.910]  When you grow stuff like Jack Flash,
[15:57.910 --> 15:59.830]  Chem 4, Bordello, Blueberry Headband,
[15:59.830 --> 16:02.150]  those things all require a third trellis
[16:02.150 --> 16:03.630]  if you do it right.
[16:03.630 --> 16:05.010]  All right, I hope I rambled on enough
[16:05.010 --> 16:07.110]  to answer that part of your question.
[16:07.990 --> 16:08.830]  Now the second part,
[16:08.830 --> 16:10.990]  you're having issues with russet mites and root aphids.
[16:10.990 --> 16:12.710]  What can you do to get rid of them?
[16:12.710 --> 16:15.870]  The more organic, the better.
[16:15.870 --> 16:18.030]  Russet mites are a bitch.
[16:18.030 --> 16:19.470]  Russet mites can destroy your crop.
[16:19.470 --> 16:22.350]  Hopefully, you sent this July 11th.
[16:22.350 --> 16:23.350]  What day are we recording?
[16:23.350 --> 16:24.190]  It's the 13th.
[16:24.190 --> 16:25.870]  Hopefully these things haven't eaten your whole crop yet
[16:25.870 --> 16:28.650]  because they fucking have the opportunity by now.
[16:28.650 --> 16:31.350]  Russet mites are a real pain in the ass.
[16:31.350 --> 16:33.190]  Most of your pesticides that are allowed
[16:33.190 --> 16:36.150]  by the Marijuana Enforcement Division in Colorado
[16:36.150 --> 16:38.250]  won't be strong enough to take down some russet mites.
[16:38.250 --> 16:41.470]  I'm not sure what you're allowed to use in Oregon,
[16:41.470 --> 16:45.670]  but one thing that I was told worked amazingly well
[16:45.670 --> 16:49.250]  in a commercial grow in Colorado was granulated sulfur.
[16:50.070 --> 16:52.690]  Granulated sulfur was applied to the plants
[16:52.690 --> 16:54.590]  as a foliar spray.
[16:54.590 --> 16:56.450]  You mix it with water and spray it on the plants.
[16:56.450 --> 16:58.430]  I don't remember the ratio.
[16:58.430 --> 17:00.870]  If you really need specific info on the ratio
[17:00.870 --> 17:03.430]  of granulated sulfur in water to apply to plants
[17:03.430 --> 17:06.350]  as a miticide and a fungicide, send me an email.
[17:06.350 --> 17:08.050]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotmail.com.
[17:08.050 --> 17:10.190]  I will ask my friend I was having this conversation with.
[17:10.190 --> 17:13.510]  He will remind me the exact grams per gallon
[17:13.510 --> 17:15.310]  and we'll get you guys all set up.
[17:15.310 --> 17:18.150]  But my friend used granulated sulfur in water
[17:18.150 --> 17:21.470]  and applied it as a foliar spray on the top
[17:21.470 --> 17:23.590]  and bottoms of the leaves, the underside of the leaves,
[17:23.590 --> 17:26.070]  and it got rid of his russet mites.
[17:26.070 --> 17:26.950]  Two applications.
[17:26.950 --> 17:28.910]  He did an application on Monday
[17:28.910 --> 17:30.750]  and another application on Friday.
[17:30.750 --> 17:32.050]  And when we looked again on Monday,
[17:32.050 --> 17:34.010]  there was no sign of russet mites.
[17:34.010 --> 17:35.610]  So that's one thing that'll work.
[17:35.610 --> 17:37.370]  And the good thing about that is
[17:37.370 --> 17:39.270]  it's not considered a pesticide.
[17:39.270 --> 17:42.970]  So there may be loopholes on if you are
[17:42.970 --> 17:44.010]  or are not allowed to use that.
[17:44.010 --> 17:47.010]  You can use it in Colorado because it's not a pesticide.
[17:47.010 --> 17:49.390]  It doesn't have to be marked as a spray
[17:49.390 --> 17:50.410]  with the Department of Ag.
[17:50.410 --> 17:52.810]  So you're allowed to use that here, I think.
[17:53.930 --> 17:56.550]  One thing I should say, if you use the granulated sulfur,
[17:56.550 --> 18:00.230]  do not apply any oils to your plants
[18:00.230 --> 18:03.110]  a week before or after using the sulfur.
[18:03.110 --> 18:04.350]  Five days should be safe.
[18:04.350 --> 18:07.370]  I'm gonna say a week just to be extra safe.
[18:07.370 --> 18:11.270]  If you add something like Azomax or Smite
[18:11.270 --> 18:16.110]  or even Azitrol or anything like that, Evergreen,
[18:16.110 --> 18:19.110]  if you add that after the sulfur has been applied
[18:19.110 --> 18:21.010]  or before the sulfur has been applied,
[18:21.010 --> 18:23.430]  the oil and the sulfur will combine
[18:23.430 --> 18:25.230]  and there's a chemical reaction that happens
[18:25.230 --> 18:27.510]  that fucking decimates your plants.
[18:27.510 --> 18:28.710]  Do not do it.
[18:28.710 --> 18:30.390]  It will ruin your crop.
[18:30.390 --> 18:31.230]  Don't do it.
[18:31.230 --> 18:33.710]  Do not apply sulfur and oils to your plants
[18:33.710 --> 18:35.390]  within five days of each other,
[18:35.390 --> 18:37.470]  maybe even a week to be safe, all right?
[18:37.470 --> 18:38.950]  Don't do that.
[18:38.950 --> 18:41.470]  So you can use granulated sulfur
[18:41.470 --> 18:43.230]  to start getting rid of the russet mites.
[18:43.230 --> 18:46.030]  If you don't, you may be in flower, I understand.
[18:46.030 --> 18:47.150]  You could be in flower.
[18:47.150 --> 18:49.590]  You don't wanna put that fucking flavor in your buds.
[18:49.590 --> 18:52.850]  You've got to decide now, do I wanna spray the sulfur
[18:52.850 --> 18:55.670]  or do I wanna lose my entire crop to russets?
[18:55.670 --> 18:57.590]  Because once they eat the flowering plants,
[18:57.590 --> 18:59.150]  they're headed right back to the veg plants,
[18:59.150 --> 19:00.190]  they're headed to the mom plants,
[19:00.190 --> 19:01.430]  they're going to the clones,
[19:01.430 --> 19:02.510]  they're gonna eat fucking everything.
[19:02.510 --> 19:04.390]  So you may need to go crazy.
[19:04.390 --> 19:06.750]  You may need to spray them with the sulfur.
[19:06.750 --> 19:09.230]  If that doesn't work or you don't wanna use that,
[19:09.230 --> 19:10.790]  you can try Xerotal.
[19:10.790 --> 19:14.110]  Xerotalerance may help you out if you're in flower.
[19:14.110 --> 19:15.630]  It won't leave a funky flavor.
[19:15.630 --> 19:18.990]  You can use it late in flower if necessary.
[19:18.990 --> 19:21.170]  I never recommend spraying anything late in flower,
[19:21.170 --> 19:23.030]  but if you've got russet mites,
[19:23.030 --> 19:24.750]  you gotta go hard right now.
[19:25.150 --> 19:29.070]  Other things I can recommend that will help you are
[19:29.070 --> 19:29.910]  Grandivo.
[19:29.910 --> 19:30.970]  Grandivo is a powder.
[19:30.970 --> 19:35.970]  I recommend Grandivo WDG, water dispersed granules.
[19:37.570 --> 19:41.750]  Do somewhere between 10 and 15 grams of Grandivo
[19:41.750 --> 19:45.430]  per gallon of water and apply it as a foliar feed.
[19:45.430 --> 19:48.130]  You can also use Azimax.
[19:48.130 --> 19:49.590]  You can use Evergreen.
[19:49.590 --> 19:52.790]  Those may help you get rid of your russets,
[19:52.790 --> 19:55.070]  but you're gonna have to be very diligent.
[19:55.070 --> 19:56.910]  You're gonna have to treat these plants
[19:56.910 --> 19:58.390]  like every other day,
[19:58.390 --> 19:59.850]  depending on what products you're using,
[19:59.850 --> 20:01.110]  but you're gonna have to stay on top of it.
[20:01.110 --> 20:03.250]  Another thing you can do to get rid of the mites
[20:03.250 --> 20:04.970]  is defoliate heavily.
[20:04.970 --> 20:06.470]  If there's a mite or a mite egg
[20:06.470 --> 20:07.790]  or some mite damage on a leaf,
[20:07.790 --> 20:09.630]  just pull that fucking leaf off,
[20:09.630 --> 20:12.750]  put it in a trash bag, seal it, get it off site.
[20:12.750 --> 20:14.350]  Do whatever you gotta do to get that fucking bag
[20:14.350 --> 20:15.310]  of leaves the fuck out of there.
[20:15.310 --> 20:17.590]  You're just taking colonies of mites somewhere else.
[20:17.590 --> 20:18.430]  Get rid of them.
[20:18.430 --> 20:20.350]  Burn them with fire if you have the option.
[20:20.910 --> 20:25.650]  Grandivo, you can mix Grandivo, Azimax, Push.
[20:25.650 --> 20:27.890]  You can mix a lot of pesticides together
[20:27.890 --> 20:31.830]  and you can come at it for multiple modes of attack
[20:31.830 --> 20:35.030]  and then you get the least amount of resistance.
[20:35.030 --> 20:37.070]  Imagine if I came at you with a karate chop
[20:37.070 --> 20:38.470]  and a knife and a gun.
[20:38.470 --> 20:39.910]  You have no way to fucking block that.
[20:39.910 --> 20:41.710]  That's what you have to do to these spider mites.
[20:41.710 --> 20:43.470]  You gotta karate kick them, you gotta stab them,
[20:43.470 --> 20:45.950]  you gotta shoot them all at the same fucking time.
[20:45.950 --> 20:49.230]  Maybe some Grandivo, maybe some Azimax,
[20:49.230 --> 20:51.870]  maybe put in some Push from Vegbloom
[20:51.870 --> 20:53.190]  just because if you're gonna hit them
[20:53.190 --> 20:54.870]  with all this bad stuff, put some Push in there
[20:54.870 --> 20:57.310]  to kinda make the plants happy while you're doing it.
[20:57.310 --> 21:00.350]  Maybe you can hit them with some Evergreen or some Smite,
[21:00.350 --> 21:01.630]  maybe some Double Nickel.
[21:01.630 --> 21:02.970]  There are a lot of things you can put in there,
[21:02.970 --> 21:04.490]  but I think the Grandivo's gonna help.
[21:04.490 --> 21:07.090]  I think the Sulfur is probably your best bet.
[21:07.090 --> 21:08.950]  If none of that stuff works,
[21:08.950 --> 21:10.870]  or if none of that sounds like a good idea to you,
[21:10.870 --> 21:13.990]  maybe it's time to try some predator mites.
[21:13.990 --> 21:16.990]  Beneficial mites like, this one's hard to pronounce,
[21:16.990 --> 21:20.390]  the Amblyseus andersoni, I'm gonna spell it for you,
[21:20.390 --> 21:25.390]  it's A-M-B-L-Y-S-E-I-U-S-A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N-I.
[21:26.950 --> 21:31.950]  Amblyseus andersoni is known to eat the russet mite.
[21:32.710 --> 21:34.470]  So maybe you need to get some of those guys,
[21:34.470 --> 21:37.310]  release them in your garden, get a lot of them,
[21:37.310 --> 21:38.290]  then maybe they'll get in there
[21:38.290 --> 21:40.690]  and they will eat the shit out of your russets.
[21:40.690 --> 21:43.750]  I would also recommend some Persimilis mites.
[21:43.750 --> 21:45.990]  They're always good, and the Swarskies get in there.
[21:45.990 --> 21:48.870]  I'm not sure if the Swarskies will eat the russets,
[21:48.870 --> 21:49.710]  but they should.
[21:49.710 --> 21:50.950]  There should be no reason why they shouldn't.
[21:50.950 --> 21:51.950]  They wanna get in there and eat.
[21:51.950 --> 21:54.650]  So some Swarskies, what are they called?
[21:54.650 --> 21:57.430]  They are Amblyseus Swarski,
[21:57.430 --> 21:59.790]  there's Photocelius Persimilis,
[21:59.790 --> 22:01.510]  and then the new guy we learned about,
[22:01.510 --> 22:03.750]  the Amblyseus andersoni.
[22:04.670 --> 22:07.590]  Those are great predators that would get in there
[22:07.590 --> 22:09.170]  and they would eat the shit out of those bugs.
[22:09.170 --> 22:11.330]  That way they're 100% organic, it's all natural,
[22:11.330 --> 22:13.710]  not applying anything, you're just releasing bugs
[22:13.710 --> 22:14.910]  the way that nature would do it.
[22:14.910 --> 22:16.750]  So that's an option also.
[22:16.750 --> 22:18.030]  That's a whole bunch of different options.
[22:18.030 --> 22:19.950]  I hope something there works for you.
[22:19.950 --> 22:21.870]  If you need more guidance, send me an email,
[22:21.870 --> 22:24.150]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com, you already know that,
[22:24.150 --> 22:26.190]  and we will narrow down what to do.
[22:26.190 --> 22:29.550]  And good luck with the fucking russets, they are a bitch.
[22:29.550 --> 22:30.790]  The next one is root aphids.
[22:30.790 --> 22:33.070]  Root aphids are fairly easy to get rid of.
[22:33.070 --> 22:35.750]  You just gotta kinda make them not wanna be there.
[22:35.750 --> 22:38.910]  That's really easy, you can do a root drench with Grandivo.
[22:38.910 --> 22:41.690]  When you Google Grandivo, it's gonna look fucking expensive.
[22:41.690 --> 22:44.270]  I apologize for the price of that, but it works.
[22:44.270 --> 22:46.190]  That's all I've got to say.
[22:46.190 --> 22:50.430]  I would do anywhere between 10 and 15 grams of Grandivo
[22:50.430 --> 22:54.110]  in a gallon, per gallon of water, and do a root drench
[22:54.110 --> 22:57.590]  and just soak every plant with the Grandivo mix.
[22:57.590 --> 22:59.950]  That should get rid of your root aphids.
[22:59.950 --> 23:03.390]  You can use Grandivo, you can also use Evergreen
[23:03.390 --> 23:05.150]  as a soil drench.
[23:05.150 --> 23:09.030]  Somewhere around 15 milliliters per gallon of Evergreen
[23:09.030 --> 23:12.590]  as a soil drench works very well to get rid of root aphids,
[23:12.590 --> 23:15.430]  fungus gnats, anything in the soil like that.
[23:15.430 --> 23:18.490]  If your plants are more established and they're stronger,
[23:18.490 --> 23:20.750]  you can get closer to 30 mils per gallon,
[23:20.750 --> 23:21.830]  but be very careful.
[23:21.830 --> 23:24.470]  I would start with 15, then maybe try 20,
[23:24.470 --> 23:25.910]  then see what 30 does.
[23:25.910 --> 23:27.590]  Maybe try 30 on one or two plants.
[23:27.590 --> 23:30.430]  If it doesn't fuck them up, then go ahead and feed them that.
[23:30.430 --> 23:32.310]  That will help get rid of root aphids.
[23:32.310 --> 23:35.750]  Also, there's another product called Botanigard Max.
[23:35.750 --> 23:40.750]  It's B-O-T-A-N-I-G-A-R-D, Botanigard Max, M-A-X-X.
[23:43.550 --> 23:45.950]  Botanigard Max is kind of pricey,
[23:45.950 --> 23:47.710]  but it will work very well
[23:47.710 --> 23:50.870]  to get rid of your soil-borne pests.
[23:50.870 --> 23:52.710]  I think it's organic, I'm not certain.
[23:52.710 --> 23:55.150]  It is approved by the MED in Colorado.
[23:55.150 --> 23:57.670]  The Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division does allow,
[23:57.670 --> 24:00.270]  and the Department of Agriculture will allow the use
[24:00.270 --> 24:02.350]  of all of the products I've listed.
[24:02.350 --> 24:06.030]  The Grandivo, Azimax, Evergreen, Botanigard,
[24:06.030 --> 24:09.830]  Cease, Smite, all of those, I'm pretty sure at this time,
[24:09.830 --> 24:12.110]  are legal and able to be used.
[24:12.110 --> 24:14.390]  The Xerotol, what else is on here?
[24:14.390 --> 24:15.870]  Double Nickel's on my list.
[24:15.870 --> 24:17.670]  Those are just a bunch of pesticides and products
[24:17.670 --> 24:20.370]  that I know that we use quite frequently
[24:20.370 --> 24:21.510]  in the commercial grow settings.
[24:21.510 --> 24:23.550]  Those are all allowed by the MED.
[24:23.550 --> 24:26.170]  I do not know the new rules on the sulfur.
[24:26.170 --> 24:28.190]  I did not apply the sulfur in my grow.
[24:28.190 --> 24:30.750]  That was not my research to be done, but it worked.
[24:30.750 --> 24:32.790]  So you may wanna do research if you're an organ,
[24:32.790 --> 24:34.290]  find out if it's allowed,
[24:34.290 --> 24:35.710]  see if it even needs to be mentioned.
[24:35.710 --> 24:38.150]  Since it's not a pesticide, it's not a food,
[24:38.150 --> 24:40.990]  does it even need to be listed on your ingredients list?
[24:40.990 --> 24:42.350]  I don't know the rules about that.
[24:42.350 --> 24:45.030]  So there are several products you can use
[24:45.030 --> 24:47.510]  to get rid of your root aphids.
[24:47.510 --> 24:49.710]  Now I know you're gonna say, I wanna go organic
[24:49.710 --> 24:52.070]  and I don't wanna go putting products into my soil
[24:52.070 --> 24:53.590]  and that shit's gonna be expensive.
[24:53.590 --> 24:54.710]  So you know what I'm gonna say,
[24:54.710 --> 24:57.350]  let's go to our friends at Arbico Organics
[24:57.350 --> 24:59.790]  and let's grab some beneficial insects.
[24:59.790 --> 25:02.130]  I think the ones that you're gonna want to get rid of
[25:02.130 --> 25:05.630]  your root aphids are going to be called,
[25:06.670 --> 25:07.510]  oh, you know what?
[25:07.950 --> 25:09.230]  It's funny, they're called aphid parasites
[25:09.230 --> 25:10.710]  and aphid predators, that's what you want.
[25:10.710 --> 25:13.310]  But first I would recommend making sure
[25:13.310 --> 25:15.870]  that what you've got are aphids.
[25:15.870 --> 25:18.270]  Aphids have, I'm pretty sure that I was taught
[25:18.270 --> 25:21.030]  that the difference between the aphids and the fungus gnats,
[25:21.030 --> 25:23.070]  all aphids have two little tailpipes
[25:23.070 --> 25:25.110]  is what I'm pretty sure I was taught.
[25:25.110 --> 25:27.230]  And then fungus gnats are just the little black flies
[25:27.230 --> 25:29.830]  that if you smack the pot, they fly up out of the pot.
[25:29.830 --> 25:33.070]  So I would verify which insect you've got
[25:33.070 --> 25:34.770]  and then I would work from there
[25:34.770 --> 25:36.390]  and work on getting rid of them.
[25:36.390 --> 25:39.030]  If you've got aphids or fungus gnats,
[25:39.030 --> 25:41.850]  all of the sprays and drenches I mentioned will work
[25:41.850 --> 25:44.730]  but you may need different predator bugs
[25:44.730 --> 25:47.190]  to get rid of different bugs.
[25:47.190 --> 25:48.830]  All right, so I'm gonna move forward with this email.
[25:48.830 --> 25:50.070]  Man, I really hope I helped you out.
[25:50.070 --> 25:52.050]  I hope I gave you a lot of options.
[25:52.050 --> 25:53.750]  The last part of the email says,
[25:53.750 --> 25:55.270]  could you also point me in the direction
[25:55.270 --> 25:59.730]  of where to find a Grokashi bucket or how to make one?
[25:59.730 --> 26:02.790]  Yes, they are easy to search for on Amazon
[26:02.790 --> 26:07.350]  but you have to search for a Bokashi, B-O-K-A-S-H-I,
[26:07.350 --> 26:10.070]  a Bokashi compost kit.
[26:10.070 --> 26:13.790]  They're 49.99 on Amazon, which is a very reasonable price.
[26:13.790 --> 26:15.270]  At grocery stores, they're closer to 60
[26:15.270 --> 26:17.510]  because they know they can mark that shit up on you.
[26:17.510 --> 26:20.990]  So a Bokashi bucket, just go search for Bokashi on Amazon.
[26:20.990 --> 26:21.950]  It should come up.
[26:21.950 --> 26:26.670]  Also, when you type in Bokashi, type in Bokashi bucket DIY.
[26:26.670 --> 26:28.310]  It'll show you how to do it yourself.
[26:28.310 --> 26:29.450]  It's super simple.
[26:29.450 --> 26:32.310]  Here's a very quick basic rundown on how to do it
[26:33.150 --> 26:35.250]  and I'm just doing this by looking at the Bokashi bucket,
[26:35.250 --> 26:37.310]  both on my counter a few feet away from me
[26:37.310 --> 26:40.430]  and in this picture here on Amazon.
[26:40.430 --> 26:42.870]  You're gonna need a five gallon bucket.
[26:42.870 --> 26:44.270]  You're going to need another bucket.
[26:44.270 --> 26:46.350]  It can either be a three or a five,
[26:46.350 --> 26:48.770]  as long as it's about the same diameter as the other bucket.
[26:48.770 --> 26:52.110]  It's going to kind of work as a lid for the other bucket
[26:53.390 --> 26:54.750]  and it's also gonna have a lid on it.
[26:54.750 --> 26:55.990]  So it needs to get a lid on it
[26:55.990 --> 26:57.990]  and also be about the same size.
[26:57.990 --> 26:59.990]  So two five gallon buckets or a five and a three
[26:59.990 --> 27:01.590]  that are near the same diameter.
[27:02.430 --> 27:06.950]  The five gallon bucket, you will put a hole near the bottom
[27:06.950 --> 27:08.030]  that will have a spigot in it.
[27:08.030 --> 27:09.430]  This is where you will drain it.
[27:09.430 --> 27:10.790]  So you've got your five gallon bucket
[27:10.790 --> 27:13.270]  with the drain toward the bottom so that you could drain it.
[27:13.270 --> 27:15.630]  Now you take your three gallon bucket
[27:15.630 --> 27:17.710]  and poke some holes in the bottom of that.
[27:17.710 --> 27:20.790]  Now you throw all of your shit into the three gallon bucket.
[27:20.790 --> 27:22.710]  You add your Bokashi activator,
[27:22.710 --> 27:24.570]  which you'll have to order also.
[27:24.570 --> 27:27.870]  You need some Bokashi or Grokashi bioactivator.
[27:27.870 --> 27:29.950]  You just need a little bit of it to get it started.
[27:29.950 --> 27:33.190]  So you've got your three gallon bucket with holes in it.
[27:33.190 --> 27:34.790]  I put down a layer of newspaper
[27:34.790 --> 27:37.790]  just to stop shit from falling through the holes.
[27:37.790 --> 27:41.290]  Once it builds up, the moisture will poke through the paper
[27:41.290 --> 27:42.750]  and you'll be able to drain it properly
[27:42.750 --> 27:45.270]  and it will slow down any debris from falling through
[27:45.270 --> 27:46.710]  and clogging up your spigot.
[27:46.710 --> 27:49.030]  So you got a five gallon bucket with a spigot on it.
[27:49.030 --> 27:52.690]  Then you've got a three gallon bucket with holes in it.
[27:53.770 --> 27:57.690]  Then you put one sheet of newspaper on top of the holes.
[27:57.690 --> 28:00.330]  Then you put your food waste.
[28:00.330 --> 28:01.930]  I put all my vegetable scraps in there.
[28:01.930 --> 28:04.570]  My avocado seeds, the shells from my avocados,
[28:04.570 --> 28:07.590]  the ends from my tomatoes, the ends from the carrots,
[28:07.590 --> 28:09.690]  leftover salads, whatever like that shit,
[28:09.690 --> 28:12.370]  any vegetables or fruit, the ends of the strawberries,
[28:12.370 --> 28:13.290]  the ends of the watermelons,
[28:13.290 --> 28:14.930]  it all goes in the Bokashi bucket.
[28:14.930 --> 28:17.050]  So I put about an inch or two inches
[28:17.050 --> 28:18.530]  worth of food waste in there.
[28:18.530 --> 28:20.830]  And then I sprinkle a handful of the activator on there.
[28:20.830 --> 28:23.330]  So you'll have the five gallon bucket.
[28:23.330 --> 28:25.450]  Then you set the three gallon bucket inside of it,
[28:25.450 --> 28:27.550]  do the paper, put the food waste in there,
[28:28.410 --> 28:30.270]  sprinkle the bioactivator on there and seal the lid.
[28:30.270 --> 28:31.310]  And every time you have,
[28:31.310 --> 28:32.910]  I would save up the scraps in a bowl.
[28:32.910 --> 28:33.870]  I don't open it every time
[28:33.870 --> 28:35.770]  because it starts to fucking stink.
[28:35.770 --> 28:37.270]  And oxygen does not help.
[28:37.270 --> 28:38.390]  You wanna keep the oxygen,
[28:38.390 --> 28:40.210]  you wanna keep this thing sealed up.
[28:40.210 --> 28:42.910]  So I keep all my food scraps in a bowl
[28:42.910 --> 28:43.830]  kind of near the bucket.
[28:43.830 --> 28:45.070]  And then when the bowl starts getting full,
[28:45.070 --> 28:48.270]  I peel off the lid, I throw in a bowl full of food scraps.
[28:48.270 --> 28:50.670]  And then I put in a sprinkle, just a little sprinkle,
[28:50.670 --> 28:52.510]  a nice little layer of the activator.
[28:52.510 --> 28:53.890]  And then I seal it back up.
[28:53.890 --> 28:56.430]  And then after about 10 to 15 days,
[28:56.430 --> 28:58.070]  so you can days-ish,
[28:58.070 --> 28:59.710]  you can usually start opening the spigot
[28:59.710 --> 29:02.070]  and draining out a little bit of the juice.
[29:02.070 --> 29:03.430]  I could probably open it right now
[29:03.430 --> 29:05.030]  and get half a mason jar
[29:05.030 --> 29:07.550]  full of just disgusting juice out of that thing.
[29:07.550 --> 29:08.670]  And that's called leachate.
[29:08.670 --> 29:11.350]  And it is high in a lot of things.
[29:11.350 --> 29:14.930]  Sean and Jesse tell me it's mostly lactic acid bacteria.
[29:14.930 --> 29:17.230]  I've noticed that it really works like,
[29:18.110 --> 29:20.790]  it works like an enzyme would work for your plants.
[29:20.790 --> 29:22.990]  I've noticed when I recycled soil,
[29:22.990 --> 29:24.750]  I used to do a lot of soil recycling.
[29:24.750 --> 29:27.630]  If I would put the lactic acid bacteria,
[29:27.630 --> 29:28.470]  I would dilute it heavily
[29:28.470 --> 29:30.450]  and put the lactic acid bacteria in there,
[29:30.450 --> 29:33.570]  those old roots would really decay much more quickly.
[29:33.570 --> 29:36.190]  So I think it helps speed up the decay
[29:36.190 --> 29:37.770]  of dying and dead matter.
[29:37.770 --> 29:40.950]  And also I've used it to unclog shower drains
[29:40.950 --> 29:42.110]  and sink drains.
[29:42.110 --> 29:43.750]  And I've noticed that when you pour it down the drain,
[29:43.750 --> 29:45.190]  it leaves the chrome super shiny.
[29:45.190 --> 29:46.990]  So it's gotta be doing something.
[29:46.990 --> 29:51.550]  It removes dead and dying organic matter very well.
[29:51.550 --> 29:52.710]  And when you feed it to your plants,
[29:52.710 --> 29:54.550]  when you just mix a little bit of it in
[29:55.390 --> 29:56.750]  with your regular basic feed
[29:56.750 --> 29:58.330]  or if you're making a tea or whatever,
[29:58.330 --> 29:59.910]  the plants fucking love it.
[29:59.910 --> 30:01.270]  The roots go crazy.
[30:01.270 --> 30:04.910]  So it's definitely a good thing to add to your lineup.
[30:04.910 --> 30:07.550]  And once again, you can get it at amazon.com.
[30:07.550 --> 30:12.310]  Just go to Amazon and search for the B-O-K-A-S-H-I
[30:12.310 --> 30:16.430]  Bokashi Compost Kit, the base model for 49.99.
[30:16.430 --> 30:19.010]  It looks like it even comes with a bag of the activator.
[30:19.010 --> 30:20.910]  You get the cool little rake to mash the shit down
[30:20.910 --> 30:23.390]  because you wanna push down the stuff inside there.
[30:23.390 --> 30:25.470]  And then it comes with some instructions.
[30:25.470 --> 30:26.770]  Man, just be prepared.
[30:26.770 --> 30:28.910]  It fucking stinks when you crack it open.
[30:28.910 --> 30:30.910]  When you go mashing the stuff down in there
[30:30.910 --> 30:34.070]  to make room to squeeze the air out, oh, it stinks.
[30:34.070 --> 30:35.910]  It will run everybody out of the house.
[30:35.910 --> 30:37.710]  So you may wanna do it outside.
[30:37.710 --> 30:39.670]  If you make your own, make sure it doesn't leak
[30:39.670 --> 30:41.590]  because when it starts dripping that juice,
[30:41.590 --> 30:43.790]  that juice will stink forever.
[30:43.790 --> 30:47.790]  If you get it on your hands, your hands will stink forever.
[30:47.790 --> 30:48.710]  All right, I'm gonna press pause.
[30:48.710 --> 30:50.030]  I'm gonna take a quick drink
[30:50.030 --> 30:51.150]  and then I'm gonna read another email
[30:51.150 --> 30:52.950]  that kind of goes along with this one
[30:53.550 --> 30:54.990]  because it talks about scrogging.
[30:54.990 --> 30:57.470]  All right, podcast world, I am back and I am well hydrated.
[30:57.470 --> 31:00.230]  I am well dabbed and now it's time to get to this next email.
[31:00.230 --> 31:02.110]  This one comes from our friend Dank Mile
[31:02.110 --> 31:04.430]  and it goes like this.
[31:04.430 --> 31:05.310]  What's up, Rasta?
[31:05.310 --> 31:07.070]  Last episode, you spoke on scrogging
[31:07.070 --> 31:09.170]  and you recommended heavy defoliating.
[31:09.170 --> 31:11.230]  I have limited space with the Screen of Green method,
[31:11.230 --> 31:12.750]  but one of the first things that I noticed
[31:12.750 --> 31:15.510]  was how limited your mobility can be,
[31:15.510 --> 31:17.850]  especially in the middle of the canopy.
[31:17.850 --> 31:19.550]  I was wondering if you could go more into depth
[31:19.550 --> 31:21.790]  on how you would advise someone to defoliate
[31:21.790 --> 31:24.590]  four five by five by five canopies
[31:24.590 --> 31:27.590]  in a rather tight 12 by 12 grow room.
[31:27.590 --> 31:28.470]  I love the show.
[31:28.470 --> 31:29.950]  I haven't missed any of your new episodes
[31:29.950 --> 31:32.090]  since I started listening a couple years back.
[31:32.090 --> 31:33.950]  I've ran a five pack of Black Cherry Chem
[31:33.950 --> 31:36.190]  and have found a keeper that's very impressive,
[31:36.190 --> 31:38.390]  Chem Dominant with plush berry coming through
[31:38.390 --> 31:39.870]  in the bag appeal.
[31:39.870 --> 31:41.390]  If you ever come to the Midwest Cup,
[31:41.390 --> 31:42.970]  I'll show you some samples.
[31:42.970 --> 31:44.830]  Take it easy, Dank Mile.
[31:44.830 --> 31:47.270]  All right, there's some great talking points in this email.
[31:47.270 --> 31:49.230]  So let's start with the defoliating.
[31:49.230 --> 31:51.510]  Yes, when you were doing a Screen of Green method,
[31:52.230 --> 31:53.230]  I recommend heavy defoliation.
[31:53.230 --> 31:54.810]  I take off a lot of leaves.
[31:54.810 --> 31:57.010]  If you look at my pictures from the commercial grow,
[31:57.010 --> 31:58.750]  you'll notice that we make them naked.
[31:58.750 --> 32:00.290]  When it comes trim time,
[32:00.290 --> 32:02.150]  there's not a lot of big fan leaf to take off
[32:02.150 --> 32:04.450]  because I've already taken it off by week six.
[32:04.450 --> 32:06.910]  So I do recommend heavy defoliating.
[32:06.910 --> 32:08.170]  You've got limited space.
[32:08.170 --> 32:09.430]  I understand that.
[32:09.430 --> 32:11.990]  I work in a room that has 24 tables
[32:11.990 --> 32:14.710]  and they've got about a foot of square of extra footage
[32:14.710 --> 32:16.350]  on each side of me total.
[32:16.350 --> 32:19.290]  Around the entire room, there's 12 inches of extra space.
[32:19.290 --> 32:20.390]  I would say it's maybe 18 inches.
[32:20.390 --> 32:21.790]  I can walk through there.
[32:21.790 --> 32:23.230]  But there's 18 inches of extra space.
[32:23.230 --> 32:25.390]  So I've got to slide the plants, the trays apart.
[32:25.390 --> 32:26.230]  Got to walk in there.
[32:26.230 --> 32:27.830]  I got to water, got to slide them back together.
[32:27.830 --> 32:28.910]  It is a pain in the ass.
[32:28.910 --> 32:31.030]  So I know what you're dealing with.
[32:31.030 --> 32:32.630]  The way to do it,
[32:32.630 --> 32:35.690]  I catch myself laying on my back inside of a tray.
[32:35.690 --> 32:37.830]  I catch myself just crawling like a monkey
[32:37.830 --> 32:39.110]  under there however I can.
[32:39.110 --> 32:41.430]  I'm six foot five, so I can reach quite a ways.
[32:41.430 --> 32:43.270]  I can reach all the way to the center of that canopy,
[32:43.270 --> 32:46.770]  but sometimes I can't get to the other side of a tray.
[32:46.770 --> 32:49.070]  So I will literally lay on my back
[32:49.110 --> 32:51.950]  and wiggle army crawl underneath the canopy
[32:51.950 --> 32:54.150]  and get to what I need to get to.
[32:54.150 --> 32:56.270]  The only way to do it is just get in there and do it, bro.
[32:56.270 --> 32:57.110]  Be very careful.
[32:57.110 --> 32:59.270]  If you've got to crawl on the ground, crawl on the ground.
[32:59.270 --> 33:03.070]  You've got to get down there and climb up in the tables.
[33:03.070 --> 33:03.990]  Climb up in the tables.
[33:03.990 --> 33:06.130]  Just be careful not to fuck anything up.
[33:06.130 --> 33:07.470]  But that's the only way to do it
[33:07.470 --> 33:09.310]  is just get in there and do it.
[33:09.310 --> 33:10.930]  It's a pain in the ass, I know.
[33:10.930 --> 33:13.530]  And it's really frustrating when the space is so tight.
[33:13.530 --> 33:15.010]  Just put on some good music,
[33:15.010 --> 33:16.550]  get in the right headspace and go in there
[33:16.550 --> 33:17.670]  and just get it done, bro.
[33:17.670 --> 33:18.630]  It's the only way you can do it.
[33:19.190 --> 33:20.030]  It's the only way it's going to happen
[33:20.030 --> 33:21.910]  is if you get in there and pull those leaves yourself.
[33:21.910 --> 33:23.950]  I've spent an entire eight hour shift
[33:23.950 --> 33:26.110]  just pulling leaves by myself in one room.
[33:26.110 --> 33:27.350]  So get in there and do it.
[33:27.350 --> 33:28.270]  You got four tables, man.
[33:28.270 --> 33:29.110]  It won't be that hard.
[33:29.110 --> 33:30.310]  It won't take that long.
[33:30.310 --> 33:32.070]  And it will improve the quality of your product.
[33:32.070 --> 33:34.190]  It will allow for more light penetration.
[33:34.190 --> 33:35.150]  It'll prevent bugs.
[33:35.150 --> 33:36.150]  It'll prevent pests.
[33:36.150 --> 33:37.230]  It'll prevent molds.
[33:37.230 --> 33:38.810]  It'll just help you out overall.
[33:38.810 --> 33:39.910]  So get in there and just pull them off.
[33:39.910 --> 33:40.950]  That's all you can do.
[33:40.950 --> 33:43.670]  Just stretch, get taller, I guess,
[33:43.670 --> 33:44.690]  or climb up right in there.
[33:44.690 --> 33:46.910]  It's always fun when you walk into the groin, you find me.
[33:46.910 --> 33:48.350]  I'm six and a half feet tall, you guys.
[33:48.870 --> 33:50.910]  I'm six foot five and 200 pounds.
[33:50.910 --> 33:53.150]  My wingspan is super long.
[33:53.150 --> 33:55.150]  You'll find me just curled up underneath the table,
[33:55.150 --> 33:56.310]  just picking leaves.
[33:56.310 --> 33:57.510]  I think it's hilarious.
[33:57.510 --> 33:58.730]  All right, I'm gonna keep going with the email.
[33:58.730 --> 34:00.190]  He goes on to say, I love the show.
[34:00.190 --> 34:01.830]  I haven't missed any of your new episodes
[34:01.830 --> 34:04.230]  since I started listening a couple years back.
[34:04.230 --> 34:05.070]  That's awesome, man.
[34:05.070 --> 34:05.890]  Thanks for the dedication.
[34:05.890 --> 34:06.990]  I appreciate that.
[34:06.990 --> 34:09.990]  I hope you're also enjoying the Throwback Thursday episodes.
[34:09.990 --> 34:11.010]  Those are for the guys like you
[34:11.010 --> 34:13.110]  that missed all that old stuff.
[34:13.110 --> 34:14.150]  Oh, you keep going and you say,
[34:14.150 --> 34:17.470]  I ran a five pack of Black Cherry Kim and found a keeper.
[34:17.510 --> 34:18.990]  Man, that's some old school stuff.
[34:18.990 --> 34:21.390]  I haven't grown or made Black Cherry Kim
[34:21.390 --> 34:22.450]  in a really long time.
[34:22.450 --> 34:24.150]  So if you've got that keeper, keep it.
[34:24.150 --> 34:25.070]  Do not let go of it.
[34:25.070 --> 34:26.790]  There are no more seeds.
[34:26.790 --> 34:28.570]  I will not make more seeds of that.
[34:28.570 --> 34:29.950]  I don't have more seeds of it.
[34:29.950 --> 34:31.990]  That is something that is in my past.
[34:31.990 --> 34:33.130]  So hang onto that.
[34:33.130 --> 34:34.670]  Don't let it go.
[34:34.670 --> 34:36.590]  It's cool that you got one that's Kim Dominant
[34:36.590 --> 34:38.030]  with plush berry through the bag of peel.
[34:38.030 --> 34:38.990]  That's pretty cool.
[34:38.990 --> 34:41.470]  A lot of them came out either really purple or really green.
[34:41.470 --> 34:43.270]  It sounds like you got one kind of in the middle.
[34:43.270 --> 34:44.110]  That's pretty cool.
[34:44.110 --> 34:46.550]  And if I do ever come to the Midwest Cup,
[34:46.550 --> 34:47.670]  I'd love to see some samples.
[34:47.670 --> 34:49.470]  Also, if you're ever in Colorado,
[34:49.470 --> 34:51.830]  I would love to see your samples.
[34:51.830 --> 34:53.030]  Dank Mile, I hope I helped you out.
[34:53.030 --> 34:55.670]  I know I told you pretty much just reach in there and do it,
[34:55.670 --> 34:57.390]  but that's the only way you can do it, bro.
[34:57.390 --> 34:59.750]  Unless you can get yourself one of those mechanical arms.
[34:59.750 --> 35:01.390]  Remember when you were a kid and you had that thing,
[35:01.390 --> 35:03.550]  the fake hand, you could squeeze it and it was like a claw.
[35:03.550 --> 35:04.750]  Give him one of those and get in there
[35:04.750 --> 35:06.070]  and pick leaves with that.
[35:06.070 --> 35:08.770]  But honestly, the best way is just shimmy on up the table,
[35:08.770 --> 35:09.790]  crawl underneath the screen,
[35:09.790 --> 35:11.470]  get in there and just defoliate by hand.
[35:11.470 --> 35:12.990]  That's how I do it.
[35:12.990 --> 35:14.510]  All right, Dank Mile, thanks again for the email.
[35:14.510 --> 35:16.410]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you'd like to send me an email,
[35:17.270 --> 35:19.250]  it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[35:19.250 --> 35:23.450]  I will read your messages on an upcoming episode.
[35:23.450 --> 35:24.690]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[35:24.690 --> 35:26.810]  I've been going for just over 35 minutes.
[35:26.810 --> 35:27.710]  And when I go by myself,
[35:27.710 --> 35:29.250]  my voice tends to burn out a little bit.
[35:29.250 --> 35:30.610]  I can already feel it doing it.
[35:30.610 --> 35:32.550]  So instead of making you guys listen into an episode
[35:32.550 --> 35:34.370]  where I'm just clearing my throat and sounding like shit,
[35:34.370 --> 35:35.690]  I'm gonna say thank you for listening.
[35:35.690 --> 35:38.370]  I'm gonna remind you to stalk me on social media.
[35:38.370 --> 35:39.950]  I would love it if you follow me on Twitter.

[35:42.970 --> 35:44.650]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[35:44.650 --> 35:47.230]  If you would love to see my cannabis photography,
[35:47.230 --> 35:49.450]  I put a lot of work into my cannabis photography.
[35:49.450 --> 35:51.570]  I've recently learned that I love taking pictures
[35:51.570 --> 35:53.610]  as much as I love growing and smoking cannabis.
[35:53.610 --> 35:55.890]  I love taking pictures of the plants I grow
[35:55.890 --> 35:57.130]  as much as I love growing it,
[35:57.130 --> 35:58.470]  as much as I love consuming it.
[35:58.470 --> 36:00.210]  It's part of the passion for me.

[36:18.490 --> 36:19.330]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[36:19.330 --> 36:20.930]  I think that's all I've got for you this week.
[36:20.930 --> 36:21.770]  I'm gonna wrap it up.
[36:21.770 --> 36:22.610]  I wanna give a huge shout out
[36:22.610 --> 36:24.530]  to my friend Tony T in New Mexico.
[36:24.530 --> 36:25.370]  And until next time,
