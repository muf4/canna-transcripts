[00:00.000 --> 00:02.420]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.420 --> 00:07.220]  It is time for episode 422 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:07.220 --> 00:11.040]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:11.040 --> 00:14.900]  It's time to add fresh new genetics to your garden, and I highly recommend Oregon Elite
[00:14.900 --> 00:21.800]  Seeds, and you can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:21.800 --> 00:26.080]  It has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:26.080 --> 00:30.440]  Today I've been taking dabs of Fortissimo Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.440 --> 00:34.320]  The label says this is a combination of Crescendo and HSB.
[00:34.320 --> 00:40.000]  The HSB I think is Han Solo Burger, another strain that I tried from Green Dot Labs recently
[00:40.000 --> 00:41.520]  that I really enjoyed.
[00:41.520 --> 00:47.320]  The flavor description here says 98 octane and dumpster, and that is ridiculously accurate.
[00:47.320 --> 00:51.560]  When you take the dab of this, it tastes like fuel and gas hitting your tongue.
[00:51.560 --> 00:54.840]  When you blow it out, it smells and tastes like hot dumpster.
[00:54.840 --> 00:58.520]  Then a couple of seconds later, there is a garlicky fuel sort of an aftertaste.
[00:58.520 --> 00:59.520]  It sounds disgusting.
[00:59.520 --> 01:01.560]  I can't get enough of it.
[01:01.560 --> 01:05.400]  I was trying to describe the flavor and aroma to somebody else, and I said it was like smoking
[01:05.400 --> 01:08.680]  a joint of gassy weed right next to the dumpster.
[01:08.680 --> 01:13.280]  For some reason, it is disgustingly delicious, and I really like the buzz from the Fortissimo.
[01:13.280 --> 01:14.280]  It's kind of mellow.
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.280]  It sits me down.
[01:15.280 --> 01:18.080]  Most of the time I buy a concentrate that makes my head spin.
[01:18.080 --> 01:20.380]  This has got me a little bit chilled out.
[01:20.380 --> 01:28.300]  On the back, the label says it does contain 67.77% THC and it's 0% CBD.
[01:28.300 --> 01:32.660]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the Fortissimo live batter.
[01:32.660 --> 01:35.660]  This stuff tastes delicious, and I'm baked, honestly.
[01:35.660 --> 01:36.660]  All right.
[01:36.660 --> 01:39.740]  I am going to read a couple of listener emails on this episode.
[01:39.740 --> 01:43.820]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to some of our friends on Patreon.
[01:43.820 --> 01:47.540]  How about a big shout out to my friend Tim R, a giant shout out to Justin.
[01:47.540 --> 01:51.060]  Of course, a big shout out to all of our friends at Hogan's Farms, a big Grow From
[01:51.060 --> 01:55.700]  Your Heart podcast shout out to Todd K. I want to give a giant shout out to Ryan S.
[01:55.700 --> 02:00.300]  As always, a big Grow From Your Heart Viking handshake to my friend Grimbolded Druid, and
[02:00.300 --> 02:05.100]  of course, a big Patreon shout out to my friend Matthew KW.
[02:05.100 --> 02:07.580]  I do appreciate all of the Patreon support.
[02:07.580 --> 02:10.680]  Once again, if you would like to learn how to become a patron, all you need to do is
[02:10.680 --> 02:14.220]  go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[02:14.220 --> 02:17.020]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:17.500 --> 02:20.060]  Again, thank you to everybody who has supported the show.
[02:20.060 --> 02:21.720]  All right, podcast world.
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.500]  At the start of the show, I did say that I had a couple of listener emails to read.
[02:25.500 --> 02:26.500]  Let's get right to it.
[02:26.500 --> 02:29.220]  The first email in this episode goes like this.
[02:29.220 --> 02:32.460]  Hey, Ross DeJeff, thank you for putting out the podcast.
[02:32.460 --> 02:33.820]  Hey, you're very welcome.
[02:33.820 --> 02:34.820]  Thank you for listening.
[02:34.820 --> 02:39.500]  I found you several months ago, and I really enjoy your energy and the positive vibe.
[02:39.500 --> 02:41.660]  Hey, thank you for noticing the positive vibe.
[02:41.660 --> 02:42.660]  That means a lot to me.
[02:42.660 --> 02:46.080]  He goes on to say, now, my wife and I listen to you all the time.
[02:46.080 --> 02:49.960]  We especially love your gift for describing cannabis smells and flavors.
[02:49.960 --> 02:52.160]  Hey, I'm glad you're listening to the show with your wife.
[02:52.160 --> 02:54.560]  That is a good relationship building experience there.
[02:54.560 --> 02:58.120]  A lot of times, the dude is listening to the Grow podcast, and his girlfriend is in the
[02:58.120 --> 03:01.720]  background going, oh, this guy again, because she's tired of hearing my voice.
[03:01.720 --> 03:03.720]  So I'm glad that the wife is into the show.
[03:03.720 --> 03:08.680]  I love that you guys appreciate my descriptions of cannabis smells and flavors.
[03:08.680 --> 03:12.320]  That has taken a while to be able to do that, so I'm glad that people are enjoying it.
[03:12.320 --> 03:15.160]  The message ends with, thank you for sharing your knowledge.
[03:15.240 --> 03:16.480]  You are very welcome.
[03:16.480 --> 03:17.840]  Thank you for the great email.
[03:17.840 --> 03:20.480]  Thank you for listening, and thank you for the great compliments.
[03:20.480 --> 03:22.760]  And then it says, thanks again, T and K.
[03:22.760 --> 03:26.880]  I don't know if they want their name set on the show, so T and K, thank you for the great
[03:26.880 --> 03:27.880]  message.
[03:27.880 --> 03:32.360]  I appreciate all of the words of kindness, and I love knowing who's out there listening.
[03:32.360 --> 03:36.720]  If anybody else out there has an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:36.720 --> 03:38.560]  Of course, I would love to hear from you.
[03:38.560 --> 03:39.560]  Let's keep moving.
[03:39.560 --> 03:43.400]  I've got another message here, and this one goes like this.
[03:43.400 --> 03:44.400]  What up, Rasta Jeff?
[03:44.400 --> 03:47.280]  I hope you had a good 420.
[03:47.280 --> 03:49.120]  My 420 was perfect.
[03:49.120 --> 03:50.520]  I couldn't have asked for anything better.
[03:50.520 --> 03:52.720]  I had a wonderful time.
[03:52.720 --> 03:53.720]  The message goes on.
[03:53.720 --> 03:55.720]  It says, mine has been great.
[03:55.720 --> 03:59.920]  Looks like we both had a great 420, so congratulations, mission accomplished.
[03:59.920 --> 04:04.840]  Then it says, first, I took the largest dab ever for me recently, and that was really
[04:04.840 --> 04:06.340]  intense.
[04:06.340 --> 04:09.560]  It was at least a tenth of a gram, which is big for me.
[04:09.560 --> 04:10.600]  Huge, in fact.
[04:10.600 --> 04:12.920]  It made me think of you.
[04:12.920 --> 04:17.520]  This guy is probably thinking of me when he takes big dabs because on the Dude Grows podcast,
[04:17.520 --> 04:19.680]  I took kind of a semi-large dab.
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.360]  In my Instagram videos, I am known for taking large dabs, and in the past, I have done quite
[04:24.360 --> 04:25.760]  large dab videos.
[04:25.760 --> 04:28.760]  Some of those may be discoverable and searchable on YouTube.
[04:28.760 --> 04:31.720]  I'm not sure, but I am known for doing gigantic dabs.
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.400]  I've slowed that down a little bit as I'm getting older, as the concentrates are better
[04:35.400 --> 04:37.320]  quality, also more expensive.
[04:37.320 --> 04:40.520]  It's not necessary to do a gram or a half gram dab.
[04:40.520 --> 04:45.320]  However, I still bust out a quarter gram or half gram dab on a regular basis.
[04:45.320 --> 04:49.160]  Sometimes people think my normal dabs are quite ridiculous.
[04:49.160 --> 04:51.920]  That's why the large dab made our friend think of me.
[04:51.920 --> 04:55.760]  He says, as soon as I blew out the smoke, I got a text, and it sounded like a kitchen
[04:55.760 --> 04:56.760]  timer.
[04:56.760 --> 04:57.760]  Perfect timing.
[04:57.760 --> 05:01.200]  I looked at my buddy and said, I'm done, and he just laughed.
[05:01.200 --> 05:03.480]  This dude takes too big of a dab for himself.
[05:03.480 --> 05:08.400]  He blows out the smoke, and then he hears ding, and he says, I'm done, bro.
[05:08.400 --> 05:09.400]  Perfect.
[05:09.400 --> 05:11.840]  That's the best part of a cartoon, just like a Bill and Ted episode.
[05:11.840 --> 05:12.840]  You nailed it, bro.
[05:12.840 --> 05:13.840]  Good job.
[05:13.840 --> 05:15.760]  I hope you and your buddy laughed your asses off at that one.
[05:15.760 --> 05:20.480]  I also hope you choked and coughed for a good four minutes off of that dab and got super
[05:20.480 --> 05:21.480]  high.
[05:21.480 --> 05:22.680]  All right, there is more to this email.
[05:22.680 --> 05:28.720]  It says, second, I had no idea I even had this, but I just found almost a whole ounce
[05:28.720 --> 05:30.840]  stuffed back in a Mason jar.
[05:30.840 --> 05:32.280]  I had no weed before this.
[05:32.280 --> 05:34.040]  I think it's some dream machine.
[05:34.040 --> 05:36.920]  I hope your 420 is just as good as mine.
[05:36.920 --> 05:39.800]  God bless, and happy belated birthday by the way.
[05:39.800 --> 05:41.500]  Dude, that is a great email.
[05:41.500 --> 05:43.640]  You took a dab that made you think of me.
[05:43.640 --> 05:44.800]  The timer went off.
[05:44.800 --> 05:47.560]  That was super funny, so I'm glad you had that experience for 420.
[05:47.560 --> 05:49.800]  I'm glad you had as good of a 420 as I did.
[05:49.800 --> 05:52.580]  Dude, you found almost an ounce of good weed.
[05:52.580 --> 05:54.920]  How stoned were you when you hid that from yourself?
[05:54.920 --> 05:57.240]  You probably didn't even hide it from yourself.
[05:57.240 --> 05:58.400]  You probably got super stoned.
[05:58.400 --> 06:00.440]  You're like, I'm going to put this ounce of weed here.
[06:00.440 --> 06:03.860]  Then he stashed it somewhere thinking it was there for safekeeping, but you were too high.
[06:03.860 --> 06:05.880]  You hid it from yourself on accident.
[06:05.880 --> 06:06.880]  Good job, bro.
[06:07.120 --> 06:10.280]  Congrats on finding that right on time for 420.
[06:10.280 --> 06:14.520]  I'm not too familiar with the strange dream machine, but I hope after being hidden away
[06:14.520 --> 06:18.120]  in that jar for so long, I hope that is beautifully cured.
[06:18.120 --> 06:20.800]  He ends up with saying, I hope your 420 is just as good.
[06:20.800 --> 06:22.080]  Dude, my 420 was perfect.
[06:22.080 --> 06:24.560]  I couldn't have done anything different to make it any better.
[06:24.560 --> 06:25.560]  It was amazing.
[06:25.560 --> 06:26.560]  It was a great time.
[06:26.560 --> 06:29.280]  Then he wraps up with, God bless, and happy belated birthday.
[06:29.280 --> 06:30.840]  Hey, thank you for the birthday wishes.
[06:30.840 --> 06:32.160]  My birthday was March 1st.
[06:32.160 --> 06:36.400]  It looks like this email came right on 420, so you're late, dude, but I still appreciate
[06:36.400 --> 06:38.400]  much love, much thanks, much respect.
[06:38.400 --> 06:39.520]  I do appreciate that.
[06:39.520 --> 06:43.360]  Hey, I hope you're smoking some of that dream machine right now while you're listening to
[06:43.360 --> 06:44.360]  me.
[06:44.360 --> 06:46.840]  All right, I've got one more email for this episode.
[06:46.840 --> 06:48.600]  This one goes like this.
[06:48.600 --> 06:50.280]  Hey, Rasta Jeff.
[06:50.280 --> 06:54.340]  I was traveling to see my grandparents, and I had you and White Mike riding shotgun to
[06:54.340 --> 06:57.640]  keep me entertained for almost the three-hour trip.
[06:57.640 --> 07:02.080]  I listened to a couple of episodes in which the topic of tolerance came up in conversation.
[07:02.080 --> 07:05.240]  Hey, first off, thanks for listening to the show while you're traveling.
[07:05.240 --> 07:10.880]  It is really cool to know that we are on the road, in the car, keeping you entertained.
[07:10.880 --> 07:11.880]  Tolerance came up.
[07:11.880 --> 07:16.080]  He says, I have limited grow space, but I smoke a fair amount of flour and concentrate,
[07:16.080 --> 07:20.200]  so I usually try to grow the largest plant I can to get the most out of it.
[07:20.200 --> 07:21.200]  That is always the idea.
[07:21.200 --> 07:22.760]  You've got to maximize your space.
[07:22.760 --> 07:25.720]  You got to maximize your growth, so that makes a lot of sense.
[07:25.720 --> 07:30.280]  He says, it seems like the effects of that strain are reduced the longer I use that one
[07:30.280 --> 07:35.720]  particular strain to the point that I have to smoke a lot to get any sort of euphoria
[07:35.720 --> 07:36.720]  from it.
[07:36.720 --> 07:38.000]  Yes, I understand why that's happening.
[07:38.000 --> 07:39.840]  We'll talk about that, but let's finish the message.
[07:39.840 --> 07:45.280]  It says, if I switch to another strain, that euphoria comes on strong and fast, but that
[07:45.280 --> 07:51.280]  will fade with prolonged use of that strain until I switch to another, and so on.
[07:51.280 --> 07:56.020]  Have you yourself experienced this or heard of other people experience this?
[07:56.020 --> 08:00.340]  Seems like this would almost show some sort of tolerance to the terpenes or other chemical
[08:00.340 --> 08:05.660]  combinations aside from just an increase in THC tolerance.
[08:05.660 --> 08:07.780]  Thoughts signed, The Milkman.
[08:07.780 --> 08:12.820]  Well, Milkman, this is a very common thing, especially somebody that smokes on my level,
[08:12.820 --> 08:15.260]  somebody that consumes the amount of product that I consume.
[08:15.260 --> 08:17.900]  This is something that I notice absolutely.
[08:17.900 --> 08:22.840]  I like to label this as something back in the day I called it strain lock.
[08:22.840 --> 08:24.900]  You were locked out from that strain.
[08:24.900 --> 08:30.120]  I'm not sure the exact scientific description or the medical explanation.
[08:30.120 --> 08:35.500]  In my opinion, kind of what you said, those terps are in your body and you're used to
[08:35.500 --> 08:37.380]  it, and your body says, I've got those.
[08:37.380 --> 08:39.440]  I'm not even going to get high from it.
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.180]  Think about people who are on any type of prescription pill.
[08:42.180 --> 08:44.980]  If it's a pain pill, if it's something for their stomach, if it's something for their
[08:44.980 --> 08:49.700]  mental health, the first few times, I don't know how long because I haven't chosen a specific
[08:49.700 --> 08:54.300]  medicine, but for a duration of taking that medicine in the beginning, you get weird effects
[08:54.300 --> 08:56.120]  from it because your body isn't used to it.
[08:56.120 --> 08:59.560]  You're getting the desired effect and you're getting what they call side effects.
[08:59.560 --> 09:00.640]  I don't think they're side effects.
[09:00.640 --> 09:02.460]  Those are also effects.
[09:02.460 --> 09:06.180]  It's unfair to label anything as a side effect if you're getting it as an effect.
[09:06.180 --> 09:07.920]  That is also part of the ride.
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.980]  I don't think that that's a fair label, but we're going to move forward and quit rambling
[09:10.980 --> 09:11.980]  about that.
[09:11.980 --> 09:13.420]  That is a whole another podcast.
[09:13.420 --> 09:16.560]  But today, if I gave you a prescription of something, I don't even know what I should
[09:16.560 --> 09:17.560]  prescribe you.
[09:17.560 --> 09:18.560]  Let's say I'm going to give you morphine.
[09:18.560 --> 09:19.560]  You're in the hospital.
[09:19.560 --> 09:20.820]  Terribly, something went wrong.
[09:20.820 --> 09:22.320]  I'm sorry I just put you in this scenario.
[09:22.320 --> 09:23.420]  You're in the hospital.
[09:23.540 --> 09:24.540]  You're on morphine.
[09:24.540 --> 09:28.000]  The first few times you hit that morphine pump, you're going to be so fucked up.
[09:28.000 --> 09:30.820]  It's going to feel like the craziest morphine trip ever.
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.760]  But after a few days, that morphine drip, all it does is ease the pain because you've
[09:35.760 --> 09:37.040]  gotten sort of immune to it.
[09:37.040 --> 09:40.760]  Your body knows what to do with this new foreign substance that you're introducing into your
[09:40.760 --> 09:41.760]  system.
[09:41.760 --> 09:43.900]  So you hit the little morphine button, you get a little dose of morphine.
[09:43.900 --> 09:46.540]  The first time, your body goes, oh, what is this new shit?
[09:46.540 --> 09:49.820]  And your brain goes, never had this before.
[09:49.820 --> 09:51.420]  And you go on a really cool morphine ride.
[09:51.420 --> 09:52.420]  I don't know what it's like.
[09:52.420 --> 09:54.140]  I don't even want to think about that.
[09:54.140 --> 09:57.060]  But I'm sure it's amazing because I've seen my buddy in the hospital having an issue with
[09:57.060 --> 09:59.100]  the morphine pump and it was his best fucking friend.
[09:59.100 --> 10:00.100]  He needed it.
[10:00.100 --> 10:01.100]  He wasn't abusing it.
[10:01.100 --> 10:02.100]  He was in a bad condition.
[10:02.100 --> 10:04.380]  But after a while, he'd hit that morphine button and nothing would happen.
[10:04.380 --> 10:05.380]  He'd be like, you all right?
[10:05.380 --> 10:07.120]  And he goes, yeah, all it does now is take away the pain.
[10:07.120 --> 10:10.340]  For the first few days, he'd hit that morphine button and it'd be like watching somebody
[10:10.340 --> 10:12.580]  just slump over and get goofy and drool on themselves.
[10:12.580 --> 10:17.940]  So my point is when you start anything new into your body, you will get much more increased
[10:17.940 --> 10:19.380]  reaction.
[10:19.380 --> 10:21.980]  Then you build up a tolerance to anything.
[10:22.540 --> 10:23.540]  You're right.
[10:23.540 --> 10:24.540]  It's not just THC.
[10:24.540 --> 10:27.340]  The THC, in my opinion, is what sends you up.
[10:27.340 --> 10:33.060]  Think about this as maybe, let's describe smoking as fireworks.
[10:33.060 --> 10:35.820]  I know this is a long shot to start with, but think of it this way.
[10:35.820 --> 10:37.820]  We're smoking and we're a firework.
[10:37.820 --> 10:41.400]  The THC decides how high up into the air you go.
[10:41.400 --> 10:43.740]  If you smoke a lot of THC, you fly higher.
[10:43.740 --> 10:47.140]  If you smoke a little bit of THC, you only go so high.
[10:47.140 --> 10:52.900]  In my opinion, the terpenes, the flavonoids, the paleates, the esters, all of the other
[10:52.900 --> 10:58.260]  compounds inside of that smoke are going to decide what direction your firework flies
[10:58.260 --> 11:02.540]  and also what color that firework puts off and also how high it gets up into the air
[11:02.540 --> 11:04.260]  before it explodes.
[11:04.260 --> 11:06.900]  That is kind of a weird description, but that's always the way I've thought of it.
[11:06.900 --> 11:09.020]  When you smoke THC, you're going up.
[11:09.020 --> 11:10.140]  You're just going to go up.
[11:10.140 --> 11:11.140]  It doesn't matter.
[11:11.140 --> 11:13.540]  You got to put some terps in there to decide what direction you go.
[11:13.540 --> 11:14.540]  Do you get paranoid?
[11:14.540 --> 11:15.540]  Do you get the munchies?
[11:15.540 --> 11:16.540]  Do you get the giggles?
[11:16.540 --> 11:17.540]  Do you get euphoria?
[11:17.540 --> 11:18.540]  Do you get relaxed?
[11:18.540 --> 11:20.500]  Do you feel like you got to poop?
[11:20.500 --> 11:21.900]  Does your pain go away?
[11:21.900 --> 11:23.260]  Does your toe tingle?
[11:23.260 --> 11:24.420]  Do you get cotton mouth?
[11:24.420 --> 11:29.460]  All those are going to be different things determined by the esters, the paleates, and
[11:29.460 --> 11:30.460]  the terpenoids.
[11:30.460 --> 11:33.500]  Now, the cotton mouth is probably because you're smoking, but all those different effects,
[11:33.500 --> 11:38.500]  all the different highs that your mind tricks you with are going to be from the paleates,
[11:38.500 --> 11:41.220]  the esters, and mostly the terpenes.
[11:41.220 --> 11:45.220]  When you were smoking the same strain for however many days, a whole harvest, 60 days
[11:45.220 --> 11:50.060]  until you harvest the next crop, you're probably giving yourself what is called strain lock,
[11:50.060 --> 11:51.060]  in my opinion.
[11:51.060 --> 11:55.180]  Now, you can probably keep your pain or whatever medical condition you're trying to keep, you
[11:55.180 --> 11:59.500]  can keep it at ease by continuing with this strain, but you're not going to get the euphoria
[11:59.500 --> 12:04.780]  which you described until you switch up and change those terps, change those paleates,
[12:04.780 --> 12:07.340]  change those esters, or change something.
[12:07.340 --> 12:11.960]  One thing I may suggest, and I don't know your growth situation, you said that you try
[12:11.960 --> 12:16.440]  to grow the biggest plant you can, maybe try to grow two plants that are half the size,
[12:16.440 --> 12:18.840]  that way you've got two different strains to smoke.
[12:18.840 --> 12:21.760]  That way you could smoke on this one for 30 days, and then when it gets old, smoke on
[12:21.760 --> 12:24.680]  this one, or smoke this one for a week, then this one for a week.
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.100]  However you feel comfortable, however you desire to medicate yourself, maybe you would
[12:29.100 --> 12:33.880]  go with two smaller plants, or perhaps four smaller plants, and smaller plants also means
[12:33.880 --> 12:35.720]  less veg time, so that may help you out.
[12:35.720 --> 12:40.080]  I don't know your grow environment or your grow situation, so maybe that's not even an
[12:40.080 --> 12:41.720]  option, I'm just making a suggestion.
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.360]  Also, if you're growing your own medicine, maybe you need to find a friend who you can
[12:46.360 --> 12:51.200]  help in his garden, or her garden, and you guys can become friends and share grow information
[12:51.200 --> 12:56.160]  and grow knowledge, and kind of get your grows on the same schedule, and then when you harvest,
[12:56.160 --> 12:58.160]  maybe you could trade an ounce for an ounce.
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.080]  I don't know where you are, I don't know your situation, that is always a suggestion.
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.120]  Here in Colorado, it's not uncommon to say, hey, I just grew way too much of this whatever
[13:06.120 --> 13:08.920]  strain, I've been smoking it just like you for way too long, I'll trade you an ounce
[13:08.920 --> 13:11.920]  for an ounce, and your friend will go, let me see the weed, let me see the weed, here
[13:11.920 --> 13:12.920]  dude, take an ounce.
[13:12.920 --> 13:15.840]  I got so much weed, we got so much herb land around in Colorado that you could probably
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.200]  just take an ounce if you wanted it, I wouldn't even notice.
[13:18.200 --> 13:20.880]  If you need a quarter or something, we'll just pass it off, don't even worry.
[13:20.880 --> 13:25.320]  But I don't know where you are, I don't know your situation, but yes, you are very accurate,
[13:25.320 --> 13:27.940]  you are experiencing something that I have called strain lock.
[13:27.940 --> 13:30.000]  This comes on very quickly for me.
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.520]  When I go shopping at the dispensary, I quite often frustrate myself because, let's see,
[13:34.520 --> 13:38.240]  the last time I went, they had, I'm just, I'm not trying to, yeah, let's see, I'm just
[13:38.240 --> 13:40.920]  going to grab, I've got most of my last shopping experience right here in front of me.
[13:40.920 --> 13:46.560]  I got one gram of Mambo batter, I got one gram of Lucky Charms Ambrosia, I got one gram
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.000]  of Magic Ambrosia, one gram of Tropicana Cookies, and one gram of Lucy Jet.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.200]  There's also some Fortissimo, some Mai Tai, some Star Dog, but you notice I bought a large
[13:58.200 --> 14:01.160]  variety and almost all of those things, I only got one gram of.
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.320]  The Tropicana Cookies, there's a four gram jar of it because it smells and tastes amazing
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.600]  and I just couldn't pass it up.
[14:06.600 --> 14:11.760]  But when I shop, I buy this variety because I quickly experience the strain lock, which
[14:11.760 --> 14:15.720]  you were talking about, even on the level that I consume these concentrates.
[14:15.720 --> 14:20.800]  I'll still, I'll smoke this whole gram of Tropicana Cookies today and I'll try to smoke
[14:20.800 --> 14:23.260]  some of that tomorrow and be like, huh, I didn't get a buzz off of that.
[14:23.260 --> 14:26.800]  And so I'll switch it up, I'll take a dab of the Lucy Jet and it'll blow my mind just
[14:26.800 --> 14:27.860]  because I switched it up.
[14:27.860 --> 14:32.360]  So it happens quite quickly to me and it still happens with concentrates.
[14:32.400 --> 14:36.960]  So when I shop for concentrates, I generally buy one gram of several different things so
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.600]  that I can enjoy it and stay buzzed for several days.
[14:39.600 --> 14:44.640]  Now where that frustrates me is I bought this Lucy Jet and I haven't tried it yet because
[14:44.640 --> 14:48.560]  I'm just going to save this one until, so I've got something fresh to switch into.
[14:48.560 --> 14:51.720]  I bet that when I open up this package, it's going to smell amazing.
[14:51.720 --> 14:55.440]  I'll take a couple of dabs of it and I'll say, shit, why didn't I buy like four or five
[14:55.440 --> 14:56.440]  of those?
[14:56.440 --> 14:59.840]  And the way the dispensaries work is when you go back, all that good shit is gone because
[14:59.920 --> 15:03.720]  the smart people bought two or three or three or four at a time when they were there.
[15:03.720 --> 15:05.520]  Whatever, that's how life goes.
[15:05.520 --> 15:06.720]  I'm staying medicated.
[15:06.720 --> 15:08.760]  I'm happy with what I'm smoking.
[15:08.760 --> 15:13.160]  But to recap on this email, what you are experiencing is what I call strain lock.
[15:13.160 --> 15:17.520]  You're going to have to switch up to another strain and don't think that you can fix this
[15:17.520 --> 15:22.000]  just by upgrading to concentrates all the time because what that will do, you'll put
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.640]  yourself in the same position with concentrates.
[15:24.640 --> 15:29.840]  I smoke so much concentrate that sometimes I will spend most of the day not medicating,
[15:29.840 --> 15:33.600]  not even thinking about medicating because I know it's not going to do anything to me.
[15:33.600 --> 15:36.800]  I'll try to wait until the evening time until right before podcast time so that I could
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.400]  actually take one of those quarter gram, half gram dabs that I'm talking about and have
[15:40.400 --> 15:44.660]  it actually fuck me up and have some sort of a tremendous mark on my day.
[15:44.660 --> 15:49.360]  If not, it's just smoking through concentrates and I never even notice any effect from it.
[15:49.360 --> 15:52.360]  So what I think you were experiencing is what I call strain lock.
[15:52.360 --> 15:55.680]  You're just going to have to switch it up or you're going to have to consume less and
[15:55.680 --> 15:56.800]  who wants to do that?
[15:56.800 --> 15:58.920]  So switch it up seems to be the option.
[15:58.920 --> 16:01.280]  All right, Milkman, I hope I answered your question.
[16:01.280 --> 16:03.040]  I want to thank you for the great email.
