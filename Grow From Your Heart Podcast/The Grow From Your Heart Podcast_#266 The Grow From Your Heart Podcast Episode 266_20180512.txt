[00:05.860 --> 00:11.020]  to Grow From Your Heart podcast. Big up Rasta man Jeff.
[00:24.520 --> 00:29.260]  Welcome back cannabis community it's time for episode number 266 of the Grow
[00:29.260 --> 00:32.880]  From Your Heart podcast. You're a source for cannabis news, education and
[00:32.880 --> 00:36.200]  conversation. That's right if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:36.200 --> 00:39.800]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:39.800 --> 00:42.760]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:42.760 --> 00:47.960]  cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host my friends call me
[00:47.960 --> 00:51.760]  Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always I need to
[00:51.760 --> 00:54.640]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[00:54.640 --> 00:59.080]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire
[00:59.080 --> 01:05.960]  Mystic Roots crew. Welcome to the show everybody. I just took a big fat dab of
[01:06.240 --> 01:10.680]  some super delicious chocolate live butter. It was extracted by our friends
[01:10.680 --> 01:17.520]  at CRX. I picked this up over at Levity Wellness in Colorado Springs. This is
[01:17.520 --> 01:21.160]  Rasta Jeff approved. This is a nice sativa. It's got my head doing nice things. It's
[01:21.160 --> 01:25.000]  got a great flavor to it. I like the way this batter feels in my lungs. I know I
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.600]  talk about love and shatter but when you smoke the batter it kind of expands in
[01:28.600 --> 01:32.320]  your lungs and you don't have to smoke as much and you get a big fat dab. Rasta
[01:32.480 --> 01:36.720]  Jeff approved. I like it. Hopefully it makes me real talkative, real clear for
[01:36.720 --> 01:40.360]  the show. Thanks for jumping in you guys. It's good to see you here. Let's see
[01:40.360 --> 01:43.280]  what are we gonna talk about in this podcast. Let's talk about my breeding
[01:43.280 --> 01:46.400]  project I keep telling you about. For the past few weeks I've been updating you
[01:46.400 --> 01:49.840]  about a breeding project. It is just about completed. That's right maybe when
[01:49.840 --> 01:52.400]  I finish this podcast the lights will have come on and I'll be able to go in
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.160]  the room and I'll see how much longer we've got to go. I've been pulling a
[01:56.160 --> 02:00.200]  random seed out every couple of days to look and see. Some of them are getting
[02:00.200 --> 02:04.240]  nice and hard. A couple of them weren't where I wanted them yet so maybe maybe
[02:04.240 --> 02:07.800]  they're ready today. There's some new stuff in there. I crossed of course
[02:07.800 --> 02:11.480]  everything was crossed to Arise. Arise is a golden goat female that was
[02:11.480 --> 02:17.720]  pollinated by a Daybreaker male. Daybreaker is Chem D crossed to Joseph O.G.
[02:17.720 --> 02:22.720]  so that makes real OG cushy real chem funky feet kind of smell and traits to
[02:22.720 --> 02:26.120]  it. Then you put the golden goat in there it made it kind of sweet, made it kind of
[02:26.120 --> 02:30.400]  tropical, it made it grow bigger and faster. So I took the Arise, I took a male
[02:30.400 --> 02:34.000]  of the Arise, put that in the grow room with a whole bunch of sexy ladies. There's
[02:34.000 --> 02:37.400]  a Strawberry Fields in there. That's gonna be brand new. I don't have
[02:37.400 --> 02:41.300]  Strawberry Fields crossed to Arise until now. I just made a small tester batch to
[02:41.300 --> 02:44.260]  check out for myself. We'll grow those see how they go. What else is in there?
[02:44.260 --> 02:49.000]  There is a Grateful Dog so we can make more Morning Dew seeds. There are
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.720]  a couple of Arise females so we can make more Arise F2 seeds. There's a Kosher
[02:53.920 --> 02:57.560]  Kush in there that I'm really excited about. I'm gonna make some Arise to Kosher
[02:57.560 --> 03:00.720]  Kush. That'll be my new cross that I'm gonna test out for myself and see where
[03:00.720 --> 03:04.080]  that goes. But I've been talking a lot about my breeding project and I'm
[03:04.080 --> 03:09.440]  excited that it is almost done. Alright what else should we talk about? Yo
[03:09.440 --> 03:14.120]  Thursday night I am proud of my city. We finally hosted a very successful
[03:14.120 --> 03:17.200]  cannabis event. We've had a few small cannabis events here in this town. We
[03:17.200 --> 03:20.760]  used to do a little smokeout sesh at the Cloud 9 hookah bar. Then one night the
[03:20.800 --> 03:25.000]  came and everyone got paranoid and nobody showed up after that. But we had a
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.280]  large official smoke event. It wasn't a smoke event it was a cannabis event but
[03:29.280 --> 03:31.480]  there was no consumption. We'll get to that here in just a minute. I'm turning
[03:31.480 --> 03:34.320]  down the music slowly so I can think better. It's hard to think with all that
[03:34.320 --> 03:37.680]  music in the headphones. Cincy night. We had Cincy night here in Pueblo, Colorado
[03:37.680 --> 03:41.720]  on Thursday. It was at the Union Depot which is the old train station is what
[03:41.720 --> 03:46.320]  it used to be. It was a big fancy building. It was a great event. Everything was done
[03:46.480 --> 03:51.840]  with class. There was not consumption inside the event. However there were
[03:51.840 --> 03:57.200]  three DAB buses sponsored by different companies outside and you were able to
[03:57.200 --> 04:00.040]  go in one of those buses and take a DAB. If you brought your own you could smoke
[04:00.040 --> 04:03.680]  your own concentrate in there. Excuse me if you did not bring your own
[04:03.680 --> 04:07.240]  concentrate they had a DAB to offer you in there. It was free. Just hop on the bus
[04:07.240 --> 04:10.920]  take a little DAB. The bus was parked so you weren't going anywhere. The catch is
[04:10.920 --> 04:15.160]  you're not allowed to smoke in a building like the the Union Depot. That
[04:15.160 --> 04:17.680]  would be illegal to smoke in there because that's basically a public place
[04:17.680 --> 04:22.000]  but those DAB buses are private property. So all the windows are blacked out. You
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.480]  can't see in there. They check your ID make sure you're old enough. You go up
[04:24.480 --> 04:27.800]  in there you take a DAB then you come out coughing. So that was the catch. That
[04:27.800 --> 04:30.800]  was how people were able to medicate. Of course if you're Rasta Jeff you've got
[04:30.800 --> 04:34.040]  your own ways of medicating. You medicated heavily before you left or
[04:34.040 --> 04:39.000]  perhaps before you walked in. But anyway Cincy night. I think it was a huge success.
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.280]  It was a very classy event. It was set up for those of you that don't go to any
[04:43.640 --> 04:46.840]  events. If you do go to cannabis events it was just like all the other events
[04:46.840 --> 04:50.280]  except you couldn't smoke there. If you don't go to events it's basically like a
[04:50.280 --> 04:54.200]  trade show. Everyone sets up their little booths all around the walls. So you walk
[04:54.200 --> 04:57.040]  you mill around in circles and they build like a little island in the middle
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.720]  of other booths that are back-to-back. So you just walk around and do the laps and
[05:00.720 --> 05:04.000]  check out all the vendors and all the booths and trade business cards and pick
[05:04.000 --> 05:06.720]  up free samples of things. They can't give out product but they can give you
[05:06.720 --> 05:11.640]  samples of like maybe people were giving out a lot of hats and stickers and shit
[05:11.640 --> 05:15.120]  like that. Some of the nutrient companies had small nutrient samples to
[05:15.120 --> 05:18.160]  give away. So stuff like that they were giving out. It was like most any other
[05:18.160 --> 05:21.600]  trade show that you'd go to for any other industry except this was cannabis
[05:21.600 --> 05:26.280]  based. For being a Pueblo event I was actually quite impressed. I wasn't sure
[05:26.280 --> 05:30.640]  if I even wanted to go. The always lovely always beautiful Miss Jenny Beth works
[05:30.640 --> 05:34.520]  for a dispensary and she was she wasn't required to go but I mean her dispensary
[05:34.520 --> 05:38.520]  asked that she go and she went. And so of course I met up with her and a couple of
[05:38.520 --> 05:42.680]  her co-workers and then hung out with of course everybody from Three Rivers.
[05:42.680 --> 05:45.720]  You guys White Mike went to an event. White Mike hardly ever makes it to these
[05:45.720 --> 05:49.120]  cannabis events. White Mike was there walking around being social had a big
[05:49.120 --> 05:52.360]  smile on his face. I think he might have been high out of his mind for a little
[05:52.360 --> 05:55.840]  bit. But Mike was there having a good time. Everybody from Three Rivers was
[05:55.840 --> 05:59.080]  there all the management. Big shout out to Miss Kelly for going to an event. I
[05:59.080 --> 06:03.480]  think that was her first industry event. Of course Christina was there having a
[06:03.480 --> 06:06.960]  good time. And so I was sitting at home debating if I wanted to go. I was making
[06:06.960 --> 06:09.520]  myself some food and I was like I might eat food and I might go down to that
[06:09.520 --> 06:14.360]  event or I might go take a nap. And then Mike texted me and he's like you need to
[06:14.360 --> 06:17.280]  come down here. And then Maddie texted me and she's like you need to come down
[06:17.280 --> 06:20.000]  here. And then Miss Jenny was like hey where are you? And I was like you know
[06:20.000 --> 06:22.320]  what I should put on my shoes and I should go hang out with all my friends
[06:22.320 --> 06:27.440]  at the Scentsy party. And you know what I'm really glad I did because I ran into
[06:27.440 --> 06:31.800]  a lot of friends. People that I have known for a long time. People that I
[06:31.800 --> 06:35.040]  haven't seen for a long time. And then I bumped into a couple of people that I'd
[06:35.040 --> 06:39.000]  never met before and that was a lot of the fun. I want to give a shout out to a
[06:39.000 --> 06:44.400]  guy named Warren. I met Warren right when I walked in. And also Steve Young. Steve
[06:44.400 --> 06:46.640]  I don't know if you listen to the podcast but it was an honor to finally
[06:46.640 --> 06:50.920]  meet you. We will hang out. You live very close to me and I will make some free
[06:50.920 --> 06:53.880]  time and I'll get over to where you are and we will hang out and medicate and
[06:53.880 --> 06:58.640]  talk. I'm sure you've got a lot to teach me. So I met a lot of new friends. People
[06:58.640 --> 07:02.520]  I'd never met before. Ran into all the Pueblo people were there. If you're from
[07:02.520 --> 07:06.360]  Pueblo and you didn't go you should have gone because all the local stoners
[07:06.360 --> 07:08.880]  were there. All the people from the dispensaries. All the people from all the
[07:08.880 --> 07:12.000]  head shops. They were all there hanging out. Everybody got along. There was no
[07:12.000 --> 07:17.840]  beef. It was a great time. It was a lot of fun. I ran into the legendary Matt Fox.
[07:17.840 --> 07:22.320]  Cooper Watts was there. Linus was there. What up Linus? The always beautiful Maddie
[07:22.320 --> 07:25.320]  was there. Spence from Garden of Weden was there. Mike from Garden of Weden was
[07:25.320 --> 07:30.320]  there. Frosty Organics was there hanging out. Miss Jenny Beth was there. It was a
[07:30.320 --> 07:34.000]  huge party. A bunch of great people were there. Vegas from the Spot was there
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.720]  getting goofy with everybody. It's a really good time. So big shout out to
[07:37.720 --> 07:42.080]  Scentsy Night. I think it was a huge success. There was no consumption in the
[07:42.080 --> 07:48.680]  building. However, they were serving alcohol and around 10 30 or 11 you could
[07:48.680 --> 07:52.280]  tell that they were serving alcohol. The vibe kind of changed. People started
[07:52.280 --> 07:56.880]  getting uh... they didn't care to represent their brand as much as they did around
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.920]  nine o'clock. I may have stuck around the event a little longer. I was getting
[08:00.920 --> 08:04.000]  hungry. Miss Jenny Beth was getting hungry. It was time to go. But I may have
[08:04.000 --> 08:06.720]  stuck around the event a little longer to see more people and be a little bit
[08:06.720 --> 08:10.720]  more social if there wasn't so much alcohol going on. I could see the vibe
[08:10.720 --> 08:13.960]  changing and I did not want to stick around to see if anything was gonna go
[08:13.960 --> 08:17.600]  wrong because there were a lot of people there and with that many businesses
[08:17.600 --> 08:21.000]  there could be rivalries. There could be beefs that nobody even knows about and
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.160]  sometimes alcohol will light the fire underneath a beef and some shit could go
[08:26.160 --> 08:31.840]  wrong. So I left. I don't appreciate the alcohol at the cannabis events but I get
[08:31.840 --> 08:35.880]  it since it's an event and it's social. I understand it. I just wish that we could
[08:35.880 --> 08:39.720]  smoke. Why can we drink alcohol but we can't smoke in there? It's... we... in
[08:39.720 --> 08:43.920]  Colorado we voted to regulate cannabis like alcohol so they can be in the same
[08:43.920 --> 08:47.520]  building. They get along. They're really good friends. I don't... I just don't
[08:47.520 --> 08:51.440]  understand it. Anyway, overall, Scentsy Night was a huge success. I just wish that
[08:51.440 --> 08:56.040]  we could smoke some dabs in there while the people are drinking beers. It seems
[08:56.120 --> 08:59.800]  fair. Alright, you guys, I'm going to press pause. I'm gonna take a quick dab. I'm
[08:59.800 --> 09:02.680]  gonna take a drink. You can hear my throat's getting that thing again. So
[09:02.680 --> 09:06.240]  I'll be back in just a second and we're going to read a couple of emails
[09:06.240 --> 09:07.400]  together. Hang tight.
[09:07.400 --> 09:29.270]  Alright, podcast world, I am back and I am well
[09:29.270 --> 09:33.390]  medicated. I just took a pretty chunky dab of some Lemon Party Ambrosia from
[09:33.390 --> 09:37.910]  Apothecary Farms. Big thumbs up to the Lemon Party. There's a lemon terp in
[09:37.910 --> 09:40.990]  there that I just love. Something about that is delicious. You know, I just
[09:40.990 --> 09:44.790]  realized that in the background you guys may hear some street racing going
[09:44.790 --> 09:48.390]  on in my neighborhood. I live a few blocks away from a pretty large street.
[09:48.390 --> 09:53.310]  It's a big, big open street and they are street racing like a mofo out there
[09:53.310 --> 09:56.790]  tonight. So if you hear in the background, I do apologize. I've got some software
[09:56.790 --> 09:59.810]  and some equipment that's trying to cut that out but they're loud tonight and I
[09:59.810 --> 10:03.310]  can hear it in my headphones which makes me think you guys can hear it. So I
[10:03.310 --> 10:06.510]  apologize for that. I'll run this show through another program and I'll try to
[10:06.510 --> 10:10.310]  take all that background noise out but I don't know how well it will work. Let's
[10:10.350 --> 10:13.910]  get back into the podcast ladies and gentlemen. Before I took a quick dab
[10:13.910 --> 10:18.790]  break I mentioned that we were going to read some emails. On a previous episode
[10:18.790 --> 10:22.950]  around Thanksgiving time I asked you guys to tell me if you consumed cannabis,
[10:22.950 --> 10:26.030]  if you smoked some weed, if you took a dab, if you ate some edibles with a
[10:26.030 --> 10:29.230]  family member or somebody new or somebody that you haven't smoked or
[10:29.230 --> 10:33.150]  consumed with in a long time. I wanted to hear about your Thanksgiving family
[10:33.150 --> 10:37.390]  cannabis experience. I got a couple of responses. I printed out one to read on
[10:37.390 --> 10:41.110]  the show tonight. I'm pulling it out of the pile of papers and it goes like this.
[10:41.110 --> 10:44.310]  This is hi my name and address. No I'm just kidding. I'm not gonna read this
[10:44.310 --> 10:47.190]  person's name. It said I'll remain anonymous right at the top of the paper
[10:47.190 --> 10:51.130]  and it says you asked for your listeners to share if they smoked with the new
[10:51.130 --> 10:55.110]  relative on Thanksgiving and I absolutely did. For the first time ever I
[10:55.110 --> 10:58.350]  shared a bowl with my mom. Well congratulations man that's super cool.
[10:58.350 --> 11:03.270]  They go on to say we had a blast and she overshared quite a lot about her newfound
[11:03.270 --> 11:07.070]  dating experiences. I never thought it would happen but I'm a little jealous of
[11:07.070 --> 11:11.590]  my mom's sex life so there you go. Peace out and I actually did take a fat dab and
[11:11.590 --> 11:17.590]  I gave my mom a hug. Well a quick awkward hug. Signed No Name. Hey No Name
[11:17.590 --> 11:20.790]  thanks for the great response. I really like that you finally smoked a bowl
[11:20.790 --> 11:24.910]  with your mom and I think it's funny. I kind of apologize but I'm kind of
[11:24.910 --> 11:28.150]  grinning funny at you that you had to hear about your mom's newfound dating
[11:28.150 --> 11:32.470]  experiences. I find it super awkward that you're jealous of your mom's sex life.
[11:32.470 --> 11:36.830]  That means you need to step up your game. But anyway I'm glad that you got to
[11:36.830 --> 11:39.990]  smoke down with mom. That's always a great thing. I haven't smoked with my
[11:39.990 --> 11:44.270]  mom in quite a long time. She used to go to concerts and stuff with me. We still
[11:44.270 --> 11:48.650]  do shit together but now she's uh she's got a job that does drug testing and so
[11:48.650 --> 11:53.510]  she just can't smoke and also she's clumsy as fuck. So she's just got that
[11:53.510 --> 11:55.910]  kind of luck that she would smoke a joint with me just to celebrate
[11:55.910 --> 11:59.510]  something silly and just the next day she would pick up a cotton ball and it
[11:59.510 --> 12:01.710]  would cut the fuck out of her because my mom is clumsy. She could hurt herself
[12:01.710 --> 12:04.990]  with a bag of cotton balls. I don't know how she could do it but she can. So I
[12:04.990 --> 12:07.870]  haven't smoked with my mom in ages but we used to get down a long long time ago.
[12:07.870 --> 12:11.010]  My mom's kind of a lightweight. She'd take one or two puffs. She's like the new
[12:11.010 --> 12:14.470]  weed is too strong. She'd take like one or two hits off with a good weed and she'd
[12:14.470 --> 12:18.470]  just be fucking wrecked. It'd be so funny. But years and years years like a hundred
[12:18.470 --> 12:21.150]  years ago my mom and I smoked weed. I think the last time we smoked was at a
[12:21.150 --> 12:25.270]  Tom Petty. It was probably a Tom Petty concert at Red Rocks. So shout out to
[12:25.270 --> 12:29.430]  moms. Anyway to my uh my listener dude I'm glad you got to smoke with your mom.
[12:29.430 --> 12:33.030]  Keep that bond strong. Alright I'm gonna move into another email. This one's got a
[12:33.270 --> 12:37.630]  different tone. I don't think this one needs much introduction. Everything is
[12:37.630 --> 12:41.750]  here in the message. It was well done. Alright it goes like this. First off, love your
[12:41.750 --> 12:45.430]  podcast. I found it a couple of weeks ago and I've just been devouring episodes
[12:45.430 --> 12:48.110]  whenever I get a chance. I've been learning some great things and it's been
[12:48.110 --> 12:53.230]  really helpful. My favorite so far was episode 252 on topping. As like most
[12:53.230 --> 12:57.190]  growers do sometimes I was nervous about topping my girls too low or too high that
[12:57.190 --> 13:00.750]  same day. Well so far thanks for the compliment dude. I'm glad I was able to
[13:00.750 --> 13:05.910]  help you out with episode 252. I'm glad you find me helpful. Then the email
[13:05.910 --> 13:09.750]  goes on like this. It says, I think you should consider revisiting episode 264
[13:09.750 --> 13:13.470]  with someone who has more organic based growing experience and have a serious
[13:13.470 --> 13:17.590]  debate about the pros and cons of synthetic versus organics. I was hoping
[13:17.590 --> 13:21.070]  to gleam some useful info for comparisons and ways the two can work
[13:21.070 --> 13:24.710]  together but I couldn't even get through the episode because it was so biased
[13:24.710 --> 13:29.350]  against organics. I think, you know, I started out as a bottle grower myself so
[13:29.350 --> 13:32.830]  I definitely know that they have their advantages but I've been making the
[13:32.830 --> 13:35.750]  switch to organics because I was starting to feel like a mad scientist
[13:35.750 --> 13:39.830]  with all the bottles, charts, and mixing times, etc. I've been able to simplify a
[13:39.830 --> 13:43.830]  lot of things, saved money, and traded time spent mixing newts for spending
[13:43.830 --> 13:47.790]  time enjoying my plants and the garden I worked so hard to put together. It was a
[13:47.790 --> 13:51.230]  little frustrating to hear such a great resource steer so many growers toward
[13:51.230 --> 13:55.270]  one direction when we need all the honest unbiased information we can get
[13:55.270 --> 13:59.070]  in a market where companies are eager to profit off of people's lack of knowledge.
[13:59.070 --> 14:04.070]  Clackamas Coode, Tad Hussey, and Tad Hassey of the Cannabis Cultivation and
[14:04.070 --> 14:07.910]  Science Podcast, or Nelson Lindley who grows a mix of organic and said
[14:07.910 --> 14:11.790]  synthetic are all great knowledgeable resources that I think would be happy to
[14:11.790 --> 14:15.870]  discuss with you if you reached out. Just a thought, keep up the great work, and
[14:15.870 --> 14:20.590]  stay black. I'm pretty sure that's a Joey Diaz reference so I will stay black
[14:20.590 --> 14:23.950]  cocksucker and if that's a Joey Diaz reference I'm not calling you a cocksucker
[14:23.950 --> 14:28.550]  out of line it's a compliment god damn it. But anyway I hope you're a Joey Diaz
[14:28.550 --> 14:31.470]  fan because that doesn't make sense if not. Anyway let's get back to the email
[14:31.470 --> 14:35.790]  get serious here. I appreciate this I know you're calling me out and saying I
[14:35.790 --> 14:39.190]  gave a biased opinion on my on my podcast when I did what I tried to do as
[14:39.190 --> 14:41.910]  a fair debate. I appreciate this I'm not taking this personally I'm taking it
[14:41.910 --> 14:45.030]  personally but I'm not taking it as an attack personally. I'm taking this as
[14:45.030 --> 14:50.790]  proper guidance. My thing was I am a bottled synthetic grower so I of course
[14:50.790 --> 14:54.510]  I lean that way. I tried to do it unbiased. Obviously I failed at that so
[14:54.510 --> 14:58.790]  thank you for pointing it out. If you're in Colorado and you'd like to come on
[14:58.790 --> 15:02.150]  the show let me know I'll get you on the show. If you can put me in touch with the
[15:02.150 --> 15:06.630]  folks that you listed at the bottom here or send me a link to get in touch with
[15:06.630 --> 15:09.110]  them I would love to get in touch with those folks I'm sure I could find them
[15:09.110 --> 15:13.310]  help me out. I honestly Clackamas Coot makes me nervous he knows so much about
[15:13.310 --> 15:16.550]  cannabis he's just gonna come blow my mind but I would love to have him on. The
[15:16.550 --> 15:19.630]  other two folks I'm not sure who they are but I am aware of Clackamas Coot.
[15:19.630 --> 15:23.110]  Another thing you said you only listened to halfway through the episode you
[15:23.150 --> 15:27.230]  didn't hear the end where I said that organic growers are gonna win because at
[15:27.230 --> 15:30.670]  the end of the world we don't have bottles. When the end of the world
[15:30.670 --> 15:33.750]  scenario comes whatever that is I always try to think like that I'm kind of a
[15:33.750 --> 15:37.310]  paranoid hippie. Shit's gonna go down dude I don't know what it is but some
[15:37.310 --> 15:39.670]  shit's gonna go down and one day you're not gonna have a grow light and you're
[15:39.670 --> 15:43.390]  not gonna have a bottled nutrient so I think that in that case the organic
[15:43.390 --> 15:45.510]  farmers are gonna win because they know how to farm they know how to grow
[15:45.510 --> 15:49.230]  everything if they know how to grow cannabis organically indoors they could
[15:49.230 --> 15:52.710]  do it all naturally under the Sun. They're gonna win. So I wish you would
[15:52.710 --> 15:57.150]  have listened to the whole episode that may have helped you out but I do agree
[15:57.150 --> 16:00.950]  that maybe I was a little bit biased because that's my experience. I can't I
[16:00.950 --> 16:04.830]  I tried to keep it fair but obviously I missed it a little bit so I apologize
[16:04.830 --> 16:10.590]  for fucking it up and not getting a fair episode like I should have done. So if
[16:10.590 --> 16:13.790]  anybody out there would like to come and do a friendly debate I want to open this
[16:13.790 --> 16:17.270]  up and keep it going I want to keep this conversation happening. I think this
[16:17.270 --> 16:21.110]  email just sparked even more of a debate. If you want to come on and keep it
[16:21.110 --> 16:24.790]  friendly I don't want you to if you are on Team Organics or on Team Salt or on
[16:24.790 --> 16:29.190]  Team Organics Plus Salt you can't come on my show and bash the opposite but you
[16:29.190 --> 16:33.990]  can come and tell me the pros and cons that you feel are why you do what you do.
[16:33.990 --> 16:37.470]  So if you want to have a friendly debate if you're in the Southern Colorado area
[16:37.470 --> 16:40.310]  I've got gear that I can come to you. I've got a Zoom H6 that fits in my
[16:40.310 --> 16:44.070]  pocket. I can carry all my shit in my hoodie if I need to. Drive up to you I
[16:44.070 --> 16:47.790]  gotta get the car fixed. That's another story. But once I get the car fixed I can
[16:47.790 --> 16:49.990]  drive right up to you. We can have this debate wherever you are. If you're in the
[16:49.990 --> 16:53.070]  Southern Colorado maybe Denver area I'll make some time. I'd love to have
[16:53.070 --> 16:56.270]  this conversation maybe one two maybe three other people. We could talk about
[16:56.270 --> 17:00.830]  organics versus synthetics all together. That way we can make it a fair debate. If
[17:00.830 --> 17:03.190]  you guys want to put me in touch with these folks that I just mentioned in the
[17:03.190 --> 17:09.790]  email Clackamas Coot, Tad Hussey, or Nelson Linsley I would not be opposed to
[17:09.790 --> 17:12.270]  you guys putting me in touch with them. I'll keep this email sitting on the top
[17:12.270 --> 17:16.070]  of the pile here so I can research those names. Hey the person that sent me this
[17:16.070 --> 17:19.910]  did you put a name on here? I'm not gonna call out your name your name's on
[17:19.910 --> 17:22.910]  the top of your email. You should correct that if you don't want people to
[17:22.910 --> 17:26.470]  know your name because it says your full name up there. But I do appreciate the
[17:26.470 --> 17:31.070]  email and thank you for the constructive criticism and pointing out that I kind
[17:31.070 --> 17:34.510]  of fucked that up. And maybe go back and listen to the second half just so that
[17:34.510 --> 17:38.990]  you can hear that I tried my best man I really did. I'm not on either team I
[17:38.990 --> 17:43.390]  just I use one so I have much I have more to say about the other. It's like if
[17:43.390 --> 17:46.710]  I tried to tell you about I don't know ask me about my iPhone and ask me about
[17:46.790 --> 17:50.070]  your iPhone. I don't know I know the basics of yours but once you get to the
[17:50.070 --> 17:52.350]  apps and shit I don't know what you got. I know everything that's in my phone
[17:52.350 --> 17:56.150]  been doing it. I don't know your phone so I can only tell you so much about your
[17:56.150 --> 18:00.270]  phone. It's an iPhone it's got a case on it, a glass screen you know what I mean?
[18:00.270 --> 18:03.470]  Just like mine does but I know so many more details about mine because I'm doing that.
[18:03.470 --> 18:07.110]  So maybe that's why I seem biased and I apologize. If anybody else out there has
[18:07.110 --> 18:11.310]  any input or has any complaints about any other episode I'd love to hear you
[18:11.310 --> 18:15.310]  guys. I think I just showed that I can take criticism well and it's gonna make
[18:15.310 --> 18:19.750]  me a better podcaster, a better teacher, a better grower and I'm trying to move
[18:19.750 --> 18:23.270]  everybody forward together so you guys are moving me forward by calling me on
[18:23.270 --> 18:26.070]  my bullshit like this. I'm not afraid of it. I'm a grown-ass man I can take
[18:26.070 --> 18:29.790]  constructive criticism. Bring it please. So thanks again for the email it doesn't
[18:29.790 --> 18:34.310]  look like you want me to say your name. Let's move forward into the next email.
[18:34.310 --> 18:38.670]  This one I'm looking to see if they've got their name on here. I see
[18:38.670 --> 18:41.710]  their name right there but nope it fucking starts his name like this. Hello
[18:41.710 --> 18:45.710]  my name is Anthony. I have basically zero experience growing cannabis but I
[18:45.710 --> 18:49.430]  want to try. I've been reading tons and listening exclusively to your grow show.
[18:49.430 --> 18:54.150]  I have some seeds from what I assume is Mexican brickweed. A sativa I'm guessing.
[18:54.150 --> 18:57.990]  I've sprouted several seeds. I pulled off from this stuff and it shoots up brother.
[18:57.990 --> 19:01.870]  I have heard that all these problems stem from poor light. Oh so he's saying
[19:01.870 --> 19:05.390]  it's just shooting straight up. I hear all these problems stem from poor light
[19:05.390 --> 19:09.590]  or could it be that it's just the strain? The real question I guess I'm asking is
[19:09.670 --> 19:13.670]  if the light isn't the problem could it just be tall-ass plants? I'm indoor
[19:13.670 --> 19:17.910]  growing on a low-budget do-it-yourself grow box. I wrote on a post these stems.
[19:17.910 --> 19:23.190]  Okay I'm gonna stop right here. Yes you need more light. The thing that plants
[19:23.190 --> 19:28.470]  want the most is light. It's lights and then maybe next is either water or air
[19:28.470 --> 19:32.710]  and then they need some dirt. I don't know that might that's not science but
[19:32.710 --> 19:36.150]  that's plants need light. Light is the number one thing that plants grow off of
[19:36.150 --> 19:39.430]  and then water and air. Those are the three things you need them and without
[19:39.510 --> 19:43.070]  those things you can't have a plant but light keeps that plant alive. You got to
[19:43.070 --> 19:45.990]  feed that plant as much light as you can give it or they're just gonna stretch
[19:45.990 --> 19:50.630]  especially seedlings. I like to get the light really close to the seedlings keep
[19:50.630 --> 19:56.150]  it right on them. I give them some t5s. Let's set the row at 8 t5s right on top
[19:56.150 --> 19:59.430]  of that seedling to where it's about maybe 6 or 8 inches above it and it's
[19:59.430 --> 20:03.790]  just getting illuminated and I do it for 18 hours maybe 24 hours a day in the
[20:03.790 --> 20:06.910]  seedlings. Just get them started super strong so if they're stretching up if
[20:06.910 --> 20:09.510]  they're shooting up real tall that's called getting leggy in the weed world
[20:09.510 --> 20:13.550]  they're stretching they're trying to get to the light. Another thing they need a
[20:13.550 --> 20:16.750]  fan on them if they're growing that fast. If you they're growing that fast and you
[20:16.750 --> 20:19.390]  put some wind on them you'll at least make them strengthen themselves up
[20:19.390 --> 20:22.750]  they'll get a little stronger but you need more light you need to get more
[20:22.750 --> 20:26.630]  light and the plants need to be closer to more light. That's your obviously the
[20:26.630 --> 20:30.070]  problem just from what you've described. It is not the strain. Any strain you put
[20:30.070 --> 20:32.790]  under that condition without enough light is going to stretch it's gonna
[20:32.790 --> 20:36.470]  shoot up like that. Things you've said indicate that you need more light. So I'm
[20:36.470 --> 20:41.870]  gonna keep going. It says where was I? I'm in a growing on a but I've read
[20:41.870 --> 20:45.950]  that these that I've read on a post that these stems can be planted deeper and
[20:45.950 --> 20:50.510]  will develop roots. Does that make them a longer taproot? Does that make the stem
[20:50.510 --> 20:54.230]  a longer taproot? Not necessarily making so you're talking about taking this
[20:54.230 --> 20:57.470]  plant that's too leggy putting it in a larger pot digging deep hole burying it
[20:57.470 --> 21:00.390]  so let's say your plant is growing eight inches you want to bury it down to where
[21:00.390 --> 21:04.790]  you've only got three inches sticking out that is effective but you can also
[21:04.950 --> 21:08.830]  overwater and kill the plant doing that but it will work it will help you out it
[21:08.830 --> 21:11.870]  doesn't make a longer taproot necessarily it just makes the stem
[21:11.870 --> 21:16.190]  buried deeper but it's the same same idea but no because the taproot developed
[21:16.190 --> 21:18.870]  way at the bottom there and grew out so you're just making you're just burying
[21:18.870 --> 21:23.070]  it deeper which works I will do that occasionally if I start off my plants in
[21:23.070 --> 21:26.230]  a cup or a small pot and they overgrow that and they get a little too big I'll
[21:26.230 --> 21:29.390]  cut off some of the bottom branches and bury them a little deeper in a three or
[21:29.390 --> 21:33.510]  seven gallon pot before I flip them and that does help. So there more of the
[21:33.510 --> 21:37.750]  email will the plant get more oxygen then no won't get more oxygen then
[21:37.750 --> 21:41.230]  you're burying it it will get less oxygen will it ruin my plant if you
[21:41.230 --> 21:45.270]  overwater it if you bury it too hard if you bury it too tight if you don't put
[21:45.270 --> 21:48.950]  it in good soil if you're rough about it yes you can ruin your plant the plants
[21:48.950 --> 21:52.390]  are very delicate when they're that small you can touch it and break it in
[21:52.390 --> 21:56.550]  half when it's that little so you got to be super super careful then you say this
[21:56.550 --> 22:01.110]  is costing me nothing out of pocket so I can take the chance a short segment of
[22:01.110 --> 22:05.510]  leggy seedlings or whatever you think may help me and others like me would be
[22:05.510 --> 22:10.790]  super awesome so we see he said a short segment on leggy seedlings or whatever
[22:10.790 --> 22:14.390]  you think may help some others like me would be super awesome yeah I'm glad to
[22:14.390 --> 22:17.990]  help you out man I'm gonna kind of do that right now so if it's costing you
[22:17.990 --> 22:20.830]  nothing in your seedlings are that stretchy and you've got more from that
[22:20.830 --> 22:24.390]  Mexican brickweed I would recommend starting more and because right now
[22:24.390 --> 22:28.030]  you're already starting off with a struggle it's if you've got free seeds
[22:28.150 --> 22:31.590]  out of that brickweed if you have more start more of them dude just start more
[22:31.590 --> 22:36.070]  and then get more light put more light closer to your seedlings that's why your
[22:36.070 --> 22:39.990]  seedlings are stretching put them in under either like a t5 or underneath
[22:39.990 --> 22:45.710]  like a 250 watt high-pressure sodium or a 250 watt halide I don't know if they
[22:45.710 --> 22:48.790]  make that I've never seen that I've never tried to buy that or underneath a
[22:48.790 --> 22:53.150]  400 watt halide lamp and then just put it kind of close not don't let it burn
[22:53.150 --> 22:56.870]  them but you want them to get plenty of light and you want it to be kind of warm
[22:56.870 --> 23:01.150]  and you want to put a light light fan on them not hard with the fan you want
[23:01.150 --> 23:05.790]  to move the air and as they grow then start increasing the fan so that's a way
[23:05.790 --> 23:09.350]  to get them a little stronger but if you've got plenty more start more dude
[23:09.350 --> 23:12.470]  throw the shitty ones away and start fresh if you can especially if they're
[23:12.470 --> 23:15.830]  free especially if it didn't cost you anything don't be in a hurry start right
[23:15.830 --> 23:18.650]  you don't want to start with a struggle that sucks just starting off with
[23:18.650 --> 23:22.570]  problems you can just go back and fix it now and have a better start go blow up
[23:22.570 --> 23:27.410]  the old one and build a new one so I guess that is my short segment on leggy
[23:27.410 --> 23:32.490]  seedlings get the light closer use the proper soil I hate to advertise a kind
[23:32.490 --> 23:36.410]  of soil but if you're new and you need a cheap light fluffy soil that you can go
[23:36.410 --> 23:40.530]  out and just drop some seedlings in light warrior from Fox Farms will work
[23:40.530 --> 23:44.410]  just fine they're not I'm not advertising for them it just works it's
[23:44.410 --> 23:49.250]  easy you can go buy it it's available at almost every hydroponic store just go
[23:49.250 --> 23:52.530]  get yourself some light warrior if you're an experienced grower you can
[23:52.530 --> 23:55.770]  figure it out I bet what kind of soil to use if you don't want to use the light
[23:55.770 --> 23:59.370]  warrior if you know why you don't want to use light warrior you know what to
[23:59.370 --> 24:03.650]  get that's what I think I'm trying to say there's just it's not there's nothing
[24:03.650 --> 24:06.210]  wrong with light warrior just some more experienced growers would prefer other
[24:06.210 --> 24:09.810]  stuff but it will work great for you if you're if that's what you need it'll do
[24:09.810 --> 24:14.510]  it so go get yourself some light warrior soil go to the grow store and get a t5
[24:14.510 --> 24:17.730]  light if you're gonna grow some stuff get the proper stuff put it under some
[24:17.730 --> 24:21.510]  good lights put it under a t5 light maybe the short one the little 18 inch
[24:21.510 --> 24:25.550]  long one I don't know how long they are like 18 24 inches you don't need the big
[24:25.550 --> 24:29.750]  3 foot by whatever one get the one with like the four bulbs in it put a few a
[24:29.750 --> 24:33.530]  few cups of the light warrior soil in there and put the plants into the dirt
[24:33.530 --> 24:36.490]  and then let them pop up like that and then see how they grow then you'll see
[24:36.490 --> 24:39.650]  the difference if you keep that light close they'll start bushing out and then
[24:39.650 --> 24:42.050]  you'll have to transplant them pretty soon and then you'll need a bigger light
[24:42.050 --> 24:46.170]  and then you'll have to flower I mean you'll need a bigger light so yeah I've
[24:46.170 --> 24:49.490]  not list all of your podcasts yet so I'm not sure if it's something you have
[24:49.490 --> 24:53.570]  covered yet I listen to them at work on headphones while I'm trimming trees in
[24:53.570 --> 24:57.890]  Missouri man that sounds like it could be so much fun sometimes and I'm not
[24:57.890 --> 25:01.610]  even being a smartass sometimes I just want to go outside we've got a big roll
[25:01.610 --> 25:04.690]  up garage door at the grow that we bring pallets in when we get deliveries and
[25:04.690 --> 25:08.210]  shit we bring the scissor lift in through there we bring the forklift in
[25:08.210 --> 25:11.310]  through there and sometimes when that thing opens up I'm like la la la la la
[25:11.310 --> 25:15.050]  outside I just want to go play so man sometimes it'd be awesome just to be out
[25:15.050 --> 25:17.770]  there trimming trees with you in Missouri with the headphones on not
[25:17.770 --> 25:21.530]  dealing with people that'd be so rad anyway he says keep up the awesomeness
[25:21.530 --> 25:25.810]  and I appreciate your helping the grow community both very big and very small
[25:25.810 --> 25:31.210]  and going off to hug my mom signed Anthony P hey man thank you for the
[25:31.210 --> 25:34.130]  great email thanks for the great question about seeds I hope I can help
[25:34.130 --> 25:39.410]  you out basically more light and closer if you can don't if you can put your
[25:39.410 --> 25:42.090]  hand in the light where the seeds are put your hand right at the top of the
[25:42.090 --> 25:45.770]  seedlings and it should feel warm but not hot you should just be able to leave
[25:45.770 --> 25:49.290]  your hand there it should be warm but not hot it should be comfortable it's
[25:49.290 --> 25:51.490]  really cool that's nice and you just want to leave your hand there that that's
[25:51.490 --> 25:54.650]  what the plant wants to it just wants to get a nice little suntan just wants to
[25:54.650 --> 25:58.690]  kick it it doesn't want to get cooked it just wants to feel warm so the light
[25:58.690 --> 26:03.890]  closer get more light on it everything will work just fine one thing I would be
[26:03.890 --> 26:06.370]  concerned about though if you don't have enough light for seedlings you're not
[26:06.370 --> 26:10.050]  gonna have enough light to flower plants so it's gonna be time to start thinking
[26:10.050 --> 26:13.090]  about bigger better lights and more space and getting all that ahead of
[26:13.090 --> 26:16.850]  yourself instead of having those seedlings stuck under a small space and
[26:16.850 --> 26:20.130]  not be prepared so start getting that planned out before you start those new
[26:20.130 --> 26:23.730]  seeds if you choose to start new seeds thanks again for the great email I do
