[00:00.000 --> 00:01.520]  Are you ready?
[00:01.520 --> 00:02.360]  Let's do it.
[00:02.360 --> 00:03.200]  Are you ready?
[00:03.200 --> 00:04.020]  Because I already hit record.
[00:04.020 --> 00:04.860]  Let's do it.
[00:04.860 --> 00:05.700]  I'm doing it, we're doing it.
[00:05.700 --> 00:06.520]  Ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06.520 --> 00:07.360]  This is live.
[00:07.360 --> 00:08.200]  It's happening, it's on.
[00:08.200 --> 00:09.320]  It's time for episode 350 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:09.320 --> 00:11.480]  podcast, thanks for joining us ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11.480 --> 00:13.920]  No intro music, I keep saying it messes up my rhythm
[00:13.920 --> 00:16.000]  and also it messes up YouTube.
[00:16.000 --> 00:18.320]  I'm getting myself in trouble using music
[00:18.320 --> 00:20.000]  that I am allowed to use on YouTube.
[00:20.000 --> 00:23.120]  It says use this music, it's free.
[00:23.120 --> 00:24.920]  Like I get it from a website that they're all about it
[00:24.920 --> 00:26.640]  but then YouTube is like you can't use that music.
[00:26.640 --> 00:28.200]  It's because somebody else has probably used
[00:28.200 --> 00:29.520]  that free music in their video
[00:30.040 --> 00:30.880]  and so now YouTube's just like,
[00:30.880 --> 00:33.040]  ha ha, first come first serve bitch.
[00:33.040 --> 00:35.480]  Everybody gets it, or everybody can use one
[00:35.480 --> 00:37.280]  and that one's already been chosen.
[00:37.280 --> 00:40.640]  Yep, yep, and so I'm just avoiding the music fiasco.
[00:40.640 --> 00:43.560]  Just gonna skip it, just gonna get right to podcasting.
[00:43.560 --> 00:45.400]  So instead of music, you get to hear this to start off.
[00:45.400 --> 00:46.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode is brought to you
[00:46.760 --> 00:48.400]  by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:48.400 --> 00:51.600]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,

[00:53.620 --> 00:56.600]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:56.600 --> 00:58.920]  They got that Lemon Jeffrey, they've got a Rise.

[01:00.920 --> 01:04.160]  so make sure you check them out, dankseed.store.
[01:04.160 --> 01:06.080]  I'm sure you heard that other voice on the other microphone.
[01:06.080 --> 01:07.820]  Joining me on the show today is White Mike.
[01:07.820 --> 01:08.720]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[01:08.720 --> 01:09.560]  Thanks, man.
[01:09.560 --> 01:11.340]  What's up, everybody?
[01:11.340 --> 01:12.400]  I'm waiting for them to reply.
[01:12.400 --> 01:13.520]  I gave them a brief moment.
[01:13.520 --> 01:14.720]  I looked at the computer like,
[01:14.720 --> 01:16.320]  oh, they're probably going, I'm good, Mike, I'm good.
[01:16.320 --> 01:17.140]  I'm doing all right.
[01:17.140 --> 01:18.400]  Don't interrupt when they're saying hi to me.
[01:18.400 --> 01:19.840]  I'm doing well, I'm having a great day.
[01:19.840 --> 01:21.400]  I'm just smoking a bowl with you guys, Mike.
[01:21.400 --> 01:22.440]  Just hanging out.
[01:22.440 --> 01:24.040]  Or I'm in my cubicle typing.
[01:24.040 --> 01:25.280]  Getting a little work done.
[01:25.280 --> 01:27.360]  Yep, we're thinking about fucking 420.
[01:27.360 --> 01:29.080]  I'm off at four, 420's coming.
[01:29.080 --> 01:31.740]  I'm just typing, Mike, and then I'll be as high as you sound.
[01:31.740 --> 01:33.120]  Everything will be cool.
[01:33.120 --> 01:33.960]  What's up, guys?
[01:33.960 --> 01:34.960]  Thanks for joining us for the podcast, Mike.
[01:34.960 --> 01:35.960]  Thanks again for coming.
[01:35.960 --> 01:36.880]  Good to be back, brother.
[01:36.880 --> 01:38.380]  If Mike's wife ever happens to hear this,
[01:38.380 --> 01:41.880]  thanks for letting him come play and be on the podcast.
[01:41.880 --> 01:43.760]  So he was talking to his wife, by the way,
[01:43.760 --> 01:45.000]  not me when he said thanks, babe.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.040]  That was totally for the wife.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.720]  That got awkward quickly.
[01:47.720 --> 01:48.640]  That'll happen.
[01:48.640 --> 01:50.260]  They got fucking weird fast in here.
[01:50.260 --> 01:52.140]  Speaking of awkward and weird,
[01:52.140 --> 01:53.600]  I want to talk about what I did yesterday.
[01:53.600 --> 01:55.000]  I got to go meet a friend
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.080]  that I have only known from the internet.
[01:57.820 --> 01:58.660]  Do you guys ever meet somebody
[01:58.660 --> 01:59.480]  that you meet on the internet?
[01:59.480 --> 02:01.280]  You meet them in person, finally?
[02:01.280 --> 02:03.080]  Didn't they used to have posters that said,
[02:03.080 --> 02:05.360]  don't meet people you met on the internet?
[02:05.360 --> 02:07.440]  Like, wasn't that a firm rule?
[02:07.440 --> 02:08.280]  That used to be a thing,
[02:08.280 --> 02:10.120]  but in this day and age with the, yeah.
[02:10.120 --> 02:12.160]  I'm officially old now, so.
[02:12.160 --> 02:13.920]  I think we're in the old club.
[02:13.920 --> 02:16.160]  We are in the old club, Mike.
[02:16.160 --> 02:18.160]  If this person passed all the initial tests
[02:18.160 --> 02:19.640]  and you got to meet an internet friend.
[02:19.640 --> 02:21.760]  Yes, and I was not Tinder.
[02:21.760 --> 02:22.680]  It was not a dating site.
[02:22.680 --> 02:23.760]  We met through Instagram.
[02:23.760 --> 02:24.860]  We actually met,
[02:25.820 --> 02:29.260]  she discovered me through Granny's Instagram live feed
[02:29.260 --> 02:30.820]  and started watching my feeds.
[02:30.820 --> 02:32.000]  She was gonna be in Denver.
[02:32.000 --> 02:32.840]  She messaged me.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.880]  She's like, hey, I'm gonna be in Colorado Springs or Denver.
[02:34.880 --> 02:37.820]  I would love to meet you and or dabbing Granny.
[02:37.820 --> 02:40.580]  And I was like, I bet I could make that happen.
[02:40.580 --> 02:42.820]  I was like, I'm pretty sure I can make it.
[02:42.820 --> 02:44.540]  You guys, I'm not inviting everybody on the planet
[02:44.540 --> 02:45.380]  to try to do this.
[02:45.380 --> 02:46.200]  This isn't the Make-A-Wish Foundation,
[02:46.200 --> 02:47.540]  but sometimes wishes are granted.
[02:47.540 --> 02:49.740]  Yeah, this just, the timing worked out so perfectly
[02:49.740 --> 02:51.220]  because Granny and I were talking about getting together.
[02:51.220 --> 02:52.260]  Anyway, this person is like,
[02:52.260 --> 02:53.340]  I wish I can get with you guys.
[02:53.380 --> 02:55.420]  And I was like, watch, we'll make magic happen.
[02:55.420 --> 02:59.660]  So I arranged for dabbing Granny and myself
[02:59.660 --> 03:01.180]  and our lovely friend, Miss Melville,
[03:01.180 --> 03:03.480]  and Melville brought along her lovely mom
[03:03.480 --> 03:04.620]  and we all met up together.
[03:04.620 --> 03:06.740]  I don't even know if I wanna reveal the place where we met
[03:06.740 --> 03:07.580]  because now people will be stalking us.
[03:07.580 --> 03:09.300]  They met at a secret location.
[03:09.300 --> 03:10.300]  That's right, we did.
[03:10.300 --> 03:13.540]  We went and it was a safe cannabis friendly location
[03:13.540 --> 03:15.060]  in Colorado Springs.
[03:15.060 --> 03:18.180]  And we met up and I got to give this lovely young lady
[03:18.180 --> 03:20.840]  her very first dab.
[03:20.840 --> 03:23.560]  And I also got to give Mel her very first dab.
[03:23.560 --> 03:24.400]  You see how I pulled that?
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.600]  I got to call Mel's mom a very lovely young lady
[03:26.600 --> 03:27.440]  right there.
[03:27.440 --> 03:29.120]  That's smooth talking for the ladies.
[03:29.120 --> 03:30.760]  But these two lovely young ladies,
[03:30.760 --> 03:32.960]  I got to give them both their first dabs.
[03:32.960 --> 03:34.240]  They both took a dab.
[03:34.240 --> 03:36.760]  I think actually Granny gave her mom her first dab.
[03:36.760 --> 03:37.600]  She held the rig.
[03:37.600 --> 03:40.760]  She got to hit a Darby rig, a quite pricey,
[03:40.760 --> 03:44.080]  pretty fancy Darby home custom rig made for dabbing Granny.
[03:44.080 --> 03:45.800]  This lady got to pull her first dab off of it.
[03:45.800 --> 03:48.040]  Miss Mel got to hit the Hitman rig for her first dab.
[03:48.040 --> 03:48.880]  Nice.
[03:48.880 --> 03:50.000]  She got to hit the rig.
[03:50.840 --> 03:51.880]  I dropped the dab in for her.
[03:51.880 --> 03:53.720]  She was dabbing at the same time as Granny.
[03:53.720 --> 03:56.600]  So her first dab was a dab video with dabbing Granny.
[03:56.600 --> 03:58.080]  Lady got nice and spoiled.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.280]  Way to dive right in.
[04:00.280 --> 04:03.040]  I've been telling this person that when she gets
[04:03.040 --> 04:05.680]  to Colorado, I'm going to get her uncomfortably high.
[04:05.680 --> 04:06.520]  That'll happen.
[04:06.520 --> 04:07.680]  Fucking mission accomplished, bro.
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.560]  I could see it on her face.
[04:08.560 --> 04:09.520]  I was like, we don't have to leave.
[04:09.520 --> 04:10.360]  She's like, I'm cool.
[04:10.360 --> 04:11.560]  I got to go eat or something.
[04:11.560 --> 04:12.400]  I was like, are you good?
[04:12.400 --> 04:13.440]  And she's like, I have to leave here.
[04:13.440 --> 04:14.640]  I'm uncomfortable.
[04:14.640 --> 04:15.960]  I was like, yeah, but you got to stay here
[04:15.960 --> 04:16.960]  if you're that uncomfortable.
[04:16.960 --> 04:18.400]  And she's like, nope, I'm leaving here.
[04:18.400 --> 04:20.880]  Trust me, motion and then interaction
[04:20.880 --> 04:23.120]  will not improve your comfortability level.
[04:23.120 --> 04:23.960]  Yeah, she is good.
[04:23.960 --> 04:24.960]  I made her hang out for quite a while
[04:24.960 --> 04:26.160]  before I'd let her drive away.
[04:26.160 --> 04:28.080]  You want snacks and rest.
[04:28.080 --> 04:29.040]  Her mom, on the other hand,
[04:29.040 --> 04:31.480]  handled her dabs like a fucking champ.
[04:31.480 --> 04:34.120]  Yeah, her mom was taking those dabs.
[04:34.120 --> 04:35.200]  She's like, can I get another dab?
[04:35.200 --> 04:37.360]  And I was like, yeah, you look just fine.
[04:37.360 --> 04:38.440]  I was like, are you sure?
[04:38.440 --> 04:39.640]  But I looked at her and I was like, yeah,
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.560]  you're fucking bright eyed and bushy tailed.
[04:41.560 --> 04:43.200]  I'll give you another dab, lady.
[04:43.200 --> 04:44.640]  So big shout out to my friend, Mel.
[04:44.640 --> 04:46.920]  It was great to finally meet you in person.
[04:46.960 --> 04:50.480]  We've been friends on the Instagram live for a long time.
[04:50.480 --> 04:52.600]  She comes in my Instagram live feed and hangs out.
[04:52.600 --> 04:54.680]  She goes in Granny's Instagram live feed and hangs out.
[04:54.680 --> 04:56.320]  I go to Granny's live feed also.
[04:56.320 --> 04:58.320]  So we're all just friends in all these different live feeds,
[04:58.320 --> 05:00.120]  but it was fun to finally meet you.
[05:00.120 --> 05:01.560]  Got a big hug, got to take some dabs,
[05:01.560 --> 05:02.720]  got to meet your mom,
[05:02.720 --> 05:04.160]  got to introduce you to Dab and Granny.
[05:04.160 --> 05:06.280]  So big shout out to Mel, shout out to her mom.
[05:06.280 --> 05:07.720]  I want to say her mom's name was Debbie.
[05:07.720 --> 05:08.680]  I'm really bad with names.
[05:08.680 --> 05:10.200]  I got that traumatic brain injury.
[05:10.200 --> 05:13.480]  Also, big shout out to the lovely Dab and Granny.
[05:13.480 --> 05:16.800]  Dude, Dab and Granny gave me a dab mat
[05:17.680 --> 05:20.200]  that is the little Dab and Granny Powerpuff girl looking,
[05:20.200 --> 05:22.480]  animated character looking thing.
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.320]  It is so cool.
[05:23.320 --> 05:24.960]  I kind of don't want to use it as a dab mat.
[05:24.960 --> 05:27.560]  I want to find a way to affix that to my refrigerator.
[05:27.560 --> 05:29.480]  Like a cool fridge magnet.
[05:30.320 --> 05:31.160]  I love it.
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.400]  Anyway, shout out to those lovely ladies
[05:32.400 --> 05:35.320]  for hanging out with me and sharing some dabs with me.
[05:35.320 --> 05:37.360]  Dab and Granny loaded me up with great gifts.
[05:37.360 --> 05:38.480]  Dude, I got this cool,
[05:38.480 --> 05:39.840]  I just want to talk about these for a second
[05:39.840 --> 05:41.880]  just because I think these are fucking super cool.
[05:41.880 --> 05:46.320]  So the first thing that comes to my mind as a boy,
[05:46.360 --> 05:47.400]  I'm a grown ass man now,
[05:47.400 --> 05:49.360]  but this reminds me of a movie from my boyhood.
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.800]  What was the movie when the dude walked in
[05:50.800 --> 05:52.240]  and tried to steal the samurai sword?
[05:52.240 --> 05:54.480]  I had a little samurai sword holder.
[05:54.480 --> 05:55.320]  Does that make any sense?
[05:55.320 --> 05:57.400]  It might've been a Steven Seagal movie.
[05:57.400 --> 05:59.360]  I don't remember a little boy stealing one,
[05:59.360 --> 06:03.200]  but yeah, if you're going to display samurai swords,
[06:03.200 --> 06:04.880]  this is the little stand for sure.
[06:04.880 --> 06:07.040]  It's just miniature.
[06:07.040 --> 06:09.320]  Yeah, so this is a little tiny,
[06:09.320 --> 06:14.320]  it would basically be, it's a sword display stand,
[06:14.480 --> 06:15.520]  but it's a tiny version.
[06:15.560 --> 06:16.560]  So imagine if you had,
[06:16.560 --> 06:19.600]  or maybe baseball bats or billiards cues.
[06:19.600 --> 06:20.840]  I don't know if you'd put billiards cues in there
[06:20.840 --> 06:22.200]  because they'd bow probably, but.
[06:22.200 --> 06:24.160]  Yeah, you don't want a cues laying like this.
[06:24.160 --> 06:27.000]  But maybe baseball bats, but anyway, this one is tiny.
[06:27.000 --> 06:27.840]  It is tiny.
[06:27.840 --> 06:30.800]  It is probably two and a half inches wide,
[06:30.800 --> 06:32.640]  and then it's got three tiers on it,
[06:32.640 --> 06:36.080]  and it's basically a shelf for your dabbers
[06:36.080 --> 06:36.920]  so that you don't have to set
[06:36.920 --> 06:39.080]  your sticky dabber on the table.
[06:39.080 --> 06:40.200]  This thing is awesome.
[06:40.200 --> 06:42.880]  It was 3D printed in a 3D printer.
[06:42.880 --> 06:44.480]  It is a sweet baby blue color.
[06:44.480 --> 06:47.520]  It's got the Dab & Granny logo right in the middle here.
[06:47.520 --> 06:48.360]  Then on the bottom,
[06:48.360 --> 06:49.200]  it looks like it's got the name
[06:49.200 --> 06:50.360]  of the company who printed it.
[06:50.360 --> 06:54.040]  It says EE710.com, printed in Detroit.
[06:54.040 --> 06:56.420]  This was gifted to me by the beautiful Dab & Granny.
[06:56.420 --> 06:59.680]  This has already gotten so much use in the past 24 hours.
[06:59.680 --> 07:01.080]  I noticed it right when I walked in.
[07:01.080 --> 07:02.440]  I'm like, yay, you don't have to hunt
[07:02.440 --> 07:04.080]  for the dab tool now that it's in place.
[07:04.080 --> 07:04.920]  It's got a little spot,
[07:04.920 --> 07:06.860]  and it's not gonna be on the table getting sticky.
[07:06.860 --> 07:09.200]  Also, along with that little accessory pack
[07:09.200 --> 07:12.480]  came a Dab & Granny carb cap holder.
[07:12.480 --> 07:15.880]  It's a, I'm gonna say it's a golf tee for your carb cap.
[07:15.880 --> 07:17.300]  That's the easiest way to explain it.
[07:17.300 --> 07:18.360]  Your carb cap sits on the,
[07:18.360 --> 07:19.640]  it goes on the rig and it gets sticky.
[07:19.640 --> 07:20.920]  Then you set it down right on the table.
[07:20.920 --> 07:22.120]  The table gets sticky.
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.320]  This basically goes between the two,
[07:24.320 --> 07:26.080]  and it holds the carb cap upright.
[07:26.080 --> 07:26.920]  Works beautifully.
[07:26.920 --> 07:27.760]  I love it.
[07:27.760 --> 07:28.680]  And since I'm giving shout outs to people,
[07:28.680 --> 07:30.280]  I always shout out to Della Luna Glass
[07:30.280 --> 07:31.840]  for my new beautiful dabber.
[07:31.840 --> 07:34.200]  I think this color is called Serendipity.
[07:34.200 --> 07:35.800]  It's a beautiful dabber.
[07:35.800 --> 07:36.640]  Great pull.
[07:36.640 --> 07:38.520]  It's got a pointy end for shattery dabs.
[07:38.520 --> 07:40.640]  It's got a scoopy end for the saucy dabs.
[07:40.640 --> 07:42.280]  So much love to all my friends
[07:43.040 --> 07:43.880]  for all the great gifts.
[07:43.880 --> 07:44.700]  I appreciate that.
[07:44.700 --> 07:45.540]  Shout out to Dab & Granny.
[07:45.540 --> 07:46.880]  Once again, shout out to Della Luna Glass.
[07:46.880 --> 07:49.760]  Yeah, it was a good time hanging out with those ladies.
[07:49.760 --> 07:50.600]  I got lit.
[07:50.600 --> 07:51.760]  Sounds like a hell of a time.
[07:51.760 --> 07:55.280]  Dab & Granny gave me some medicated,
[07:56.720 --> 07:58.960]  it's cannabis syrup,
[07:58.960 --> 08:03.000]  and it's 1000 milligrams in this little bottle.
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.600]  And it's called Nano-Infused.
[08:05.600 --> 08:07.800]  And I'm not exactly sure how they Nano-Infused it.
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.320]  They did not write that on the bottle.
[08:09.320 --> 08:10.920]  I'm going to research that.
[08:10.920 --> 08:13.400]  I was told there are two methods used for Nano-Infusing,
[08:13.400 --> 08:15.840]  and one is unhealthy and the other is healthy.
[08:15.840 --> 08:19.640]  I did it once and I got lit as shit
[08:19.640 --> 08:21.000]  off that 1000 milligrams.
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.660]  Dude, just a little bit.
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.520]  It says to drink a capful,
[08:24.520 --> 08:26.400]  and I drank a lotful.
[08:26.400 --> 08:28.360]  I probably drank three ounces of that stuff.
[08:28.360 --> 08:29.760]  Did you take a gulp or three?
[08:29.760 --> 08:30.720]  Yeah.
[08:30.720 --> 08:35.000]  And immediately, as the drink went into my body,
[08:35.000 --> 08:36.300]  I could feel it hit my stomach,
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.880]  and then I could feel it spread out.
[08:37.880 --> 08:40.820]  I was like, oh, oh, it didn't stop.
[08:41.720 --> 08:43.060]  Now it's going down my arms,
[08:43.060 --> 08:44.420]  and there it goes through my fingertips,
[08:44.420 --> 08:46.180]  and there it goes to my brain.
[08:46.180 --> 08:48.180]  I was like, oh my goodness.
[08:48.180 --> 08:50.340]  I could just feel myself get slow motion
[08:50.340 --> 08:51.180]  and melt a little bit.
[08:51.180 --> 08:53.180]  I was like a piece of wax next to a flame.
[08:53.180 --> 08:56.660]  That's specifically why I don't play with tinctures anymore.
[08:58.420 --> 08:59.860]  I've done that more than once.
[08:59.860 --> 09:00.700]  Yeah.
[09:02.500 --> 09:03.580]  It was a long day.
[09:03.580 --> 09:04.420]  Yep.
[09:04.420 --> 09:07.300]  So everybody, I posted a picture of the bottle to Instagram,
[09:07.300 --> 09:10.500]  and I've seen Mama Bear Dabs, Miss Lucy,
[09:11.180 --> 09:12.940]  and I've seen her sip it quite frequently on her live feeds,
[09:12.940 --> 09:15.500]  but she takes little sips, like little hobo sips.
[09:15.500 --> 09:16.820]  Just a little nips.
[09:16.820 --> 09:18.300]  And Granny does the same.
[09:18.300 --> 09:20.420]  And when Granny gave me this, I was like,
[09:20.420 --> 09:21.260]  eh, she's like, try it.
[09:21.260 --> 09:22.660]  And I was like, okay, and she goes, go lightly.
[09:22.660 --> 09:24.700]  And I was like, or, and she's like, oh my God, Jeff.
[09:24.700 --> 09:26.540]  And I was like, yeah, we're just gonna fucking do this.
[09:26.540 --> 09:27.660]  Uber's a thing, I'm good.
[09:27.660 --> 09:29.060]  I posted a picture of it,
[09:29.060 --> 09:31.140]  and everybody that has experienced it
[09:31.140 --> 09:32.940]  posted sweet dreams or nighty night
[09:32.940 --> 09:34.140]  or sweet dreams, my friend.
[09:34.140 --> 09:35.980]  Lucy right away was like, good night, my friend,
[09:35.980 --> 09:37.580]  was her comment immediately.
[09:37.580 --> 09:38.860]  And I see her sip it all the time,
[09:38.860 --> 09:40.340]  so she knew what was coming.
[09:41.180 --> 09:42.140]  That stuff got me lit, but I survived through it.
[09:42.140 --> 09:43.940]  I did not have to take an extra nap.
[09:43.940 --> 09:46.340]  I stayed up, actually, as late as I needed to be up.
[09:46.340 --> 09:47.420]  And then I had a normal night.
[09:47.420 --> 09:50.540]  So yeah, that syrup was, it was potent.
[09:50.540 --> 09:53.700]  It definitely, if you are not a dabber,
[09:53.700 --> 09:54.960]  if you're not a heavy consumer,
[09:54.960 --> 09:57.260]  if you don't have a high saturation of THC in your body
[09:57.260 --> 09:58.100]  on a regular basis.
[09:58.100 --> 09:58.920]  Yeah, if you're a low consumer,
[09:58.920 --> 09:59.760]  don't buy nothing that strong.
[09:59.760 --> 10:00.580]  Don't get, it's not even,
[10:00.580 --> 10:02.460]  I don't think it's a Colorado available product.
[10:02.460 --> 10:04.740]  It doesn't have any of the Colorado compliance stuff.
[10:04.740 --> 10:07.100]  Granny's been flying around to all the events and festivals.
[10:07.100 --> 10:08.180]  It could have come from Michigan.
[10:08.180 --> 10:09.780]  It could have come from Seattle.
[10:10.220 --> 10:11.420]  It could have been from anywhere,
[10:11.420 --> 10:12.780]  but she gets a lot of gifts.
[10:12.780 --> 10:14.540]  Somebody actually stole,
[10:14.540 --> 10:16.540]  I don't know how much of this I should talk about.
[10:16.540 --> 10:18.660]  Dabbing Granny carries a lot of concentrates on her.
[10:18.660 --> 10:21.240]  And in Seattle, somebody stole her bag of concentrates
[10:21.240 --> 10:23.340]  while she was on stage doing an event.
[10:23.340 --> 10:26.360]  And when she said so, Seattle made up for it.
[10:26.360 --> 10:27.500]  And then some.
[10:27.500 --> 10:28.700]  Seattle was like, oh yeah,
[10:28.700 --> 10:30.340]  somebody stole from you in our town.
[10:30.340 --> 10:31.180]  Here you go.
[10:31.180 --> 10:32.340]  And they gave her, yeah,
[10:32.340 --> 10:33.780]  every vendor in Seattle hooked her up.
[10:33.780 --> 10:36.580]  So, so hard that some of it landed on my table.
[10:36.580 --> 10:37.420]  It's over here.
[10:37.420 --> 10:38.240]  We're going to dab it.
[10:38.520 --> 10:40.800]  She was like, I need somebody to smoke this for me
[10:40.800 --> 10:42.460]  because they gave me way too much.
[10:42.460 --> 10:44.360]  So shout out to all the people in Seattle
[10:44.360 --> 10:45.640]  that took good care of Dabbing Granny
[10:45.640 --> 10:47.000]  and a big middle finger to the person
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.480]  that stole something from Dabbing Granny.
[10:48.480 --> 10:49.400]  Fuck that person.
[10:49.400 --> 10:51.320]  How are you going to steal from a sweet ass old lady?
[10:51.320 --> 10:52.400]  Come on, suck it.
[10:52.400 --> 10:53.760]  You steal from a granny?
[10:53.760 --> 10:54.600]  Please.
[10:54.600 --> 10:55.420]  Yeah, my granny even.
[10:55.420 --> 10:56.260]  I'll whip your ass.
[10:56.260 --> 10:57.080]  Go play in traffic.
[10:57.080 --> 10:58.400]  So many people ready to,
[10:58.400 --> 10:59.220]  ready to stand up for her,
[10:59.220 --> 11:00.080]  but it's been fixed.
[11:00.080 --> 11:00.920]  Fuck it.
[11:00.920 --> 11:01.740]  Karma sorted it all out.
[11:01.740 --> 11:03.440]  Granny got plenty of gifts in return.
[11:03.440 --> 11:04.360]  Thanks for stepping up Seattle.
[11:04.360 --> 11:06.200]  And that person probably burned themselves or something.
[11:06.200 --> 11:07.080]  Glad you had Granny's bag.
[11:07.080 --> 11:07.920]  Yes.
[11:07.920 --> 11:08.740]  Much respect.
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.080]  So it's episode 350.
[11:11.080 --> 11:12.200]  It feels like we should be doing
[11:12.200 --> 11:13.040]  some sort of celebration.
[11:13.040 --> 11:14.240]  350!
[11:14.240 --> 11:15.560]  We didn't do what I normally do.
[11:15.560 --> 11:17.640]  I normally tell people what we're smoking on.
[11:17.640 --> 11:19.080]  But we're smoking on all kinds of stuff today.
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.440]  Yeah, we've smoked a variety.
[11:20.440 --> 11:21.280]  Mike's been here for a few.
[11:21.280 --> 11:23.060]  Sorry about the occasional coughs, folks.
[11:23.060 --> 11:24.520]  The dabs before the show.
[11:24.520 --> 11:25.360]  So that's me.
[11:25.360 --> 11:26.540]  You know, it's that season.
[11:26.540 --> 11:28.520]  It's right at this season in Colorado.
[11:28.520 --> 11:30.200]  Half the people I know are like, I'm sick right now.
[11:30.200 --> 11:31.280]  I'm like, stay the fuck away from me.
[11:31.280 --> 11:33.320]  I just get a chest thing at this season,
[11:33.320 --> 11:34.160]  a nose and chest thing.
[11:34.160 --> 11:35.560]  I don't feel sick, but I will,
[11:35.560 --> 11:37.480]  and my lungs will change at this time of year.
[11:37.480 --> 11:38.380]  What I'm talking about, you guys,
[11:38.380 --> 11:41.000]  it just went from 102 degrees every day
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.280]  to 70 degrees just over fucking night.
[11:43.280 --> 11:44.120]  Boom.
[11:44.120 --> 11:46.720]  It's snowing like an hour and 20 from here.
[11:46.720 --> 11:48.400]  Oh, shut up with the S word.
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.240]  Like, you just drive.
[11:49.240 --> 11:50.060]  God damn it.
[11:50.060 --> 11:52.000]  I mean, basically you're driving straight up,
[11:52.000 --> 11:53.680]  but about an hour and 20 from here,
[11:53.680 --> 11:55.120]  it was fucking snowing yesterday.
[11:55.120 --> 11:56.460]  And then they're gonna destroy the highway
[11:56.460 --> 11:58.000]  right before all that happens.
[11:58.000 --> 11:59.500]  Yeah, so we're gonna have fun here in Colorado.
[11:59.500 --> 12:00.720]  Let's get back to what we're smoking on.
[12:00.720 --> 12:02.380]  Obviously, it's fucking working.
[12:03.260 --> 12:04.640]  I've been smoking on the coffee nectar.
[12:04.640 --> 12:05.920]  We've talked about the coffee nectar
[12:05.920 --> 12:07.600]  several times on the podcast.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.640]  Mike's coughing so hard he took off his headphones,
[12:09.640 --> 12:11.600]  you guys, if that tells you anything.
[12:11.600 --> 12:12.980]  Talked about the coffee nectar.
[12:12.980 --> 12:16.840]  It's the dark roast coffee and watermelon candy flavored.
[12:16.840 --> 12:18.560]  Just trying to get further from the microphone.
[12:18.560 --> 12:19.800]  I like it.
[12:19.800 --> 12:21.620]  I really like this gunslinger nectar.
[12:21.620 --> 12:23.780]  This is Starfighter and Stardog.
[12:23.780 --> 12:26.200]  It's described as watermelon gummy slices
[12:26.200 --> 12:28.920]  and fresh ripe watermelon.
[12:28.920 --> 12:32.040]  I've described it as those candies
[12:32.040 --> 12:34.380]  that old people have in a candy dish on the table
[12:35.120 --> 12:36.420]  that are wrapped in a strawberry looking wrapper.
[12:36.420 --> 12:38.300]  I think this tastes just like that when you dab it.
[12:38.300 --> 12:39.460]  If you wanna dab it, I'd go for it, bro.
[12:39.460 --> 12:40.820]  I really like the coffee.
[12:40.820 --> 12:44.100]  It was, imagine taking a sip of coffee
[12:44.100 --> 12:46.060]  while you're in a small space
[12:46.060 --> 12:48.980]  with somebody over vaping something watermelon flavored.
[12:48.980 --> 12:51.020]  That's a really good description.
[12:51.020 --> 12:55.740]  Right off the bat, you get a nice light coffee flavor,
[12:55.740 --> 12:59.580]  but almost immediately that dissolves
[12:59.580 --> 13:01.500]  and it's a light watermelon candy.
[13:01.500 --> 13:03.260]  So it's like being in the car with Brian?
[13:03.260 --> 13:04.220]  A little bit.
[13:05.060 --> 13:07.540]  I'm like, I'm gonna go for a coffee and watermelon vapes.
[13:07.540 --> 13:08.380]  What's up, Brian?
[13:08.380 --> 13:10.020]  I hope you listen to this one day, bro.
[13:10.020 --> 13:11.700]  And then Mike was kind enough to bring over
[13:11.700 --> 13:14.740]  some New York City Diesel batter from Apothecary.
[13:14.740 --> 13:15.580]  Oh, it's so good.
[13:15.580 --> 13:17.380]  The texture on that is really nice.
[13:17.380 --> 13:18.820]  I like the texture. I love their batters.
[13:18.820 --> 13:22.580]  And that flavor, it left, I don't know what terp that is,
[13:22.580 --> 13:24.260]  but I've been in love.
[13:24.260 --> 13:26.220]  Everybody that has seen me smoking
[13:26.220 --> 13:28.460]  the New York City Diesel live on the Instagram,
[13:28.460 --> 13:29.660]  they're like, dude, that one really gets you
[13:29.660 --> 13:30.940]  because it just gets me talking
[13:30.940 --> 13:32.900]  and it puts a smile on my face.
[13:32.900 --> 13:36.860]  That's why I brought that flavor is I'm exhausted today
[13:36.860 --> 13:39.100]  and that one really perks me up.
[13:39.100 --> 13:41.940]  Mike's got those new baby eyes.
[13:41.940 --> 13:45.380]  Yeah, it was a long night
[13:45.380 --> 13:47.460]  with a very small child last night,
[13:47.460 --> 13:50.500]  but this New York City Diesel's got me on my feet.
[13:50.500 --> 13:51.340]  Nice.
[13:51.340 --> 13:52.500]  Hell yeah, 350, yo.
[13:52.500 --> 13:53.580]  Congratulations.
[13:53.580 --> 13:54.420]  Thank you, man.
[13:54.420 --> 13:55.260]  That's a big milestone.
[13:55.260 --> 13:58.020]  I haven't missed a Monday in close to five years
[13:58.020 --> 13:59.260]  if I've done my math correctly.
[13:59.260 --> 14:00.980]  Consistent as fuck.
[14:00.980 --> 14:02.300]  One time I gotta give you a shout out
[14:02.740 --> 14:03.900]  because one time I was actually sick.
[14:03.900 --> 14:05.780]  It was probably this time of the fucking year
[14:05.780 --> 14:07.820]  and I sent you and a couple other guys a text message.
[14:07.820 --> 14:08.660]  I was like, boys, I'm sick as fuck.
[14:08.660 --> 14:10.180]  It was me and Adam and-
[14:10.180 --> 14:11.260]  Jesse, I think.
[14:11.260 --> 14:12.100]  Yeah.
[14:12.100 --> 14:13.860]  And you guys came over and maybe Kevin, I don't remember.
[14:13.860 --> 14:15.260]  Might have been, I don't even remember.
[14:15.260 --> 14:16.940]  I just remember a bunch of us around the table
[14:16.940 --> 14:18.940]  and you were like, I'm sick, I'm gonna hit record
[14:18.940 --> 14:20.260]  and like, here's some hash.
[14:20.260 --> 14:21.980]  Yep, that's pretty much how it went.
[14:21.980 --> 14:23.100]  You guys got stoned as fuck.
[14:23.100 --> 14:23.980]  We got this, bro.
[14:23.980 --> 14:25.140]  I turned to these knobs over here
[14:25.140 --> 14:27.020]  that make the podcast happen and hit record
[14:27.020 --> 14:29.980]  and I was like, guys, I'm sick, we're gonna do a show.
[14:29.980 --> 14:31.260]  And then you guys talked and I was like,
[14:31.260 --> 14:32.460]  thanks for listening in.
[14:32.460 --> 14:34.700]  But in my book, that's a fucking podcast.
[14:34.700 --> 14:37.420]  It came out, so yeah, I think it's been close
[14:37.420 --> 14:41.060]  to five years if I did my math correctly.
[14:41.060 --> 14:42.820]  Every time you and I try to figure out
[14:42.820 --> 14:45.660]  how long it's been while we're recording a show,
[14:45.660 --> 14:46.500]  it gets ridiculous.
[14:46.500 --> 14:47.340]  Yeah.
[14:47.340 --> 14:48.180]  I'm not even gonna try right now.
[14:48.180 --> 14:49.900]  Somebody out there will let us know.
[14:49.900 --> 14:52.380]  And then if I time it right, bro,
[14:52.380 --> 14:53.420]  I don't wanna make any promises.
[14:53.420 --> 14:55.660]  I have to record a couple of bonus episodes
[14:55.660 --> 14:58.060]  and put them out like ahead of schedule.
[14:58.060 --> 14:59.820]  I gotta do, so I do a Monday and Thursday show.
[14:59.820 --> 15:01.980]  If I throw out a Friday show here and there,
[15:01.980 --> 15:05.700]  we can get episode 420 on 420, bro.
[15:05.700 --> 15:07.340]  Oh man, I don't know if that'll happen.
[15:07.340 --> 15:08.180]  I'm trying.
[15:08.180 --> 15:09.020]  Let's, cause that's a lot of work.
[15:09.020 --> 15:10.260]  We can try to make that happen.
[15:10.260 --> 15:12.340]  We can try, but that's so much,
[15:12.340 --> 15:13.180]  that's, I gotta get out of the calendar again.
[15:13.180 --> 15:14.860]  All right, folks, we're gonna need coffee.
[15:14.860 --> 15:16.540]  I think I need seven extra episodes.
[15:16.540 --> 15:17.780]  Yeah, gonna need coffee.
[15:17.780 --> 15:18.940]  You need a bigger bong.
[15:20.700 --> 15:21.540]  Let's move forward,
[15:21.540 --> 15:23.820]  cause I forgot what the fuck I was gonna say anyway.
[15:23.820 --> 15:24.660]  Yeah, episode 420.
[15:24.660 --> 15:27.820]  And then maybe we'll do that episode about 420.
[15:27.860 --> 15:30.700]  We'll do episode 420 on 420 about 420.
[15:30.700 --> 15:33.700]  That's like three seconds worth of overused as fuck content.
[15:37.380 --> 15:39.740]  Mike just smacked his head directly onto the microphone.
[15:39.740 --> 15:41.860]  No, this show is for people who are curious
[15:41.860 --> 15:43.140]  about the current state of cannabis.
[15:43.140 --> 15:45.220]  So I suppose it would be an inappropriate topic,
[15:45.220 --> 15:49.300]  but man, I've read that fucking shit post so many times.
[15:49.300 --> 15:50.140]  Oh, the Waldo's?
[15:50.140 --> 15:51.260]  Here's the origin of 420.
[15:51.260 --> 15:52.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[15:52.380 --> 15:53.700]  We'll talk about what it means to us
[15:53.700 --> 15:55.260]  and how we got introduced to it or something.
[15:55.260 --> 15:56.100]  Right.
[15:56.100 --> 15:56.940]  That'd be episode 420 on 420.
[15:57.260 --> 15:58.100]  That's what the New York City Civic Center
[15:58.100 --> 16:00.500]  was back in like 99, 2001.
[16:00.500 --> 16:01.700]  Let's not blow the whole episode, bro.
[16:01.700 --> 16:03.420]  We got 70 episodes to go.
[16:03.420 --> 16:04.260]  70 to get there.
[16:04.260 --> 16:05.860]  They like it when we ramble.
[16:05.860 --> 16:06.700]  They sure do.
[16:06.700 --> 16:08.900]  And this is gonna be a rambly episode, you guys.
[16:08.900 --> 16:10.820]  He hadn't picked up on that by now.
[16:10.820 --> 16:11.660]  Every time Mike is here.
[16:11.660 --> 16:12.700]  This is official.
[16:12.700 --> 16:15.540]  Mike is a fucking train wreck of a podcast and I love it.
[16:15.540 --> 16:16.620]  It makes it so much fun.
[16:16.620 --> 16:18.820]  Thanks for not saying train wreck of a human.
[16:18.820 --> 16:20.540]  No, just on a podcast.
[16:20.540 --> 16:21.860]  No, you got most of your life.
[16:21.860 --> 16:24.020]  Most of your life that you reveal
[16:24.020 --> 16:24.860]  seems to be pretty in effect.
[16:24.860 --> 16:26.500]  The stuff I tell people about.
[16:27.100 --> 16:28.220]  Looks on the up and up.
[16:28.220 --> 16:29.380]  Man, the shit you're hiding.
[16:29.380 --> 16:30.340]  Them skeletons, bro.
[16:30.340 --> 16:31.180]  I'm curious.
[16:31.180 --> 16:32.500]  You gotta bear the skeletons deep.
[16:32.500 --> 16:34.220]  That's how people don't find them.
[16:34.220 --> 16:35.060]  No, no.
[16:35.060 --> 16:35.900]  Mike seems to be an upstanding citizen.
[16:35.900 --> 16:36.740]  Pro tip, everybody.
[16:36.740 --> 16:37.580]  Pro tip.
[16:37.580 --> 16:41.740]  All right.
[16:41.740 --> 16:43.940]  We're gonna, like I said, a fucking train wreck.
[16:43.940 --> 16:45.580]  I'm trying to find some rails.
[16:45.580 --> 16:47.980]  I've got a couple iTunes comments I wanna read.
[16:47.980 --> 16:49.820]  And then since it's episode 350,
[16:49.820 --> 16:51.380]  I feel like it's appropriate to read iTunes comments.
[16:51.380 --> 16:52.860]  I'm not sure why that felt like appropriate, but it is.
[16:52.860 --> 16:54.200]  We've got three new comments.
[16:54.200 --> 16:55.040]  Two of them are good.
[16:55.040 --> 16:56.720]  One of them, we'll talk about it.
[16:56.720 --> 16:57.600]  It finally happened.
[16:57.600 --> 16:59.080]  Yeah, we finally got a negative comment, you guys,
[16:59.080 --> 17:00.600]  which fucking I've expected it.
[17:00.600 --> 17:02.400]  And that's cool because when you get a negative comment
[17:02.400 --> 17:05.440]  on iTunes, it actually puts you in the algorithm
[17:05.440 --> 17:07.900]  for your comments to be seen by other viewers.
[17:07.900 --> 17:09.520]  It'll put you up in the advertising and stuff,
[17:09.520 --> 17:10.960]  and it'll ask more people to leave reviews
[17:10.960 --> 17:14.260]  because now it believes that not all of my five-star reviews
[17:14.260 --> 17:16.840]  are Russian trolls or some sort of bots or something.
[17:16.840 --> 17:18.320]  It's like, oh, look, somebody actually did this.
[17:18.320 --> 17:20.360]  This guy got 90 cousins to each submitter.
[17:20.360 --> 17:21.200]  Exactly.
[17:21.200 --> 17:23.320]  He just went and made 150 email accounts
[17:23.320 --> 17:24.880]  and made reviews under all of those.
[17:25.720 --> 17:26.960]  But now they believe it because somebody gave a bad review,
[17:26.960 --> 17:28.140]  and if I was trolling myself,
[17:28.140 --> 17:29.360]  I wouldn't put a bad review in there.
[17:29.360 --> 17:30.600]  So now they believe it and it's real,
[17:30.600 --> 17:32.920]  so I've seen it pop up in more places, which is cool.
[17:32.920 --> 17:35.500]  Let's get to the first two positive reviews.
[17:35.500 --> 17:38.440]  This one was left on August 29th.
[17:38.440 --> 17:40.840]  This person, I'm trying to read their name.
[17:40.840 --> 17:42.640]  Oh, and I just hit the wrong damn button on the iPad.
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.100]  Their name is OHSIN666.
[17:45.100 --> 17:47.600]  Maybe it's OhioSIN666.
[17:47.600 --> 17:49.280]  I'm down with wherever you're from and whoever you are.
[17:49.280 --> 17:51.200]  Thanks for the great review because it goes like this.
[17:51.200 --> 17:54.740]  Great podcast, probably one of the best out there.
[17:55.580 --> 17:57.380]  Originally, I was hooked on the Joe Rogan experience,
[17:57.380 --> 17:59.020]  but as soon as I found podcasts,
[17:59.020 --> 18:00.980]  he spelled it with a P, podcasts,
[18:00.980 --> 18:03.600]  I got hooked on the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[18:03.600 --> 18:06.240]  I've been hooked ever since and I listen to it daily.
[18:06.240 --> 18:08.520]  I've learned a lot and I've been reminded
[18:08.520 --> 18:10.660]  of a lot of stuff I had forgotten.
[18:10.660 --> 18:11.980]  That's great because I like to go back
[18:11.980 --> 18:14.020]  and remind you of the stuff that we forget
[18:14.020 --> 18:15.860]  because we get so advanced that you forget.
[18:15.860 --> 18:18.580]  You become a black belt, you forget that white belt kata.
[18:18.580 --> 18:20.540]  I gotta go back and leg kick you one time
[18:20.540 --> 18:22.220]  and you remember shit, they throw low leg kicks.
[18:22.220 --> 18:23.220]  That's basic shit.
[18:23.220 --> 18:25.020]  Gotta go back and remind you.
[18:25.020 --> 18:26.820]  The review keeps going, it says,
[18:26.820 --> 18:29.020]  I won't stop listening till I've heard them all.
[18:29.020 --> 18:30.760]  Keep them coming, Jeff.
[18:30.760 --> 18:32.900]  Hey dude, thanks for the great five star review.
[18:32.900 --> 18:36.980]  Anytime a review on my show has the word Joe Rogan in it,
[18:36.980 --> 18:38.260]  it makes me fucking smile.
[18:38.260 --> 18:40.020]  He didn't say I sound like Joe Rogan,
[18:40.020 --> 18:40.860]  I am as good as Joe Rogan.
[18:40.860 --> 18:43.300]  He just put the words Joe Rogan in there.
[18:43.300 --> 18:44.140]  That's all I see.
[18:44.140 --> 18:44.980]  Referencing in the same paragraph.
[18:44.980 --> 18:46.420]  That's all I see, Joe Rogan.
[18:46.420 --> 18:49.060]  So awesome, five stars for you, brother, thank you.
[18:49.060 --> 18:51.140]  That's a way to put a smile on my face.
[18:51.140 --> 18:53.060]  But for real, man, thanks for listening.
[18:53.900 --> 18:54.740]  Thanks for the review.
[18:54.740 --> 18:56.740]  Keep listening and you'll never hear them all
[18:56.740 --> 18:59.300]  because there will always be more coming.
[18:59.300 --> 19:00.460]  Yep.
[19:00.460 --> 19:02.100]  All right, there's another review.
[19:02.100 --> 19:03.800]  I'm counting down to the negative review, Mike.
[19:03.800 --> 19:06.140]  I can see him drum rolling on the table over there.
[19:06.140 --> 19:09.020]  This one says best podcast on MMJ,
[19:09.020 --> 19:11.500]  which is medical marijuana.
[19:11.500 --> 19:12.740]  Yeah, if you're looking for something
[19:12.740 --> 19:14.900]  that's not about marijuana, this show's not gonna help you.
[19:14.900 --> 19:18.980]  True, if you're looking for like boats, cars, trains.
[19:18.980 --> 19:20.340]  Yeah, this one is not gonna be,
[19:20.340 --> 19:22.380]  this show is, this is not the show for you.
[19:22.820 --> 19:25.900]  But if you're curious about cannabis,
[19:25.900 --> 19:28.620]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[19:29.900 --> 19:32.180]  That rant was brought to you by a podcast.
[19:32.180 --> 19:34.580]  Yes, shout out to Green Dot Labs.
[19:34.580 --> 19:36.540]  All right, so this one was left on August 29th
[19:36.540 --> 19:37.900]  by a person that calls themselves
[19:37.900 --> 19:40.140]  the authority in all tech.
[19:41.100 --> 19:41.940]  It's the authority.
[19:41.940 --> 19:43.380]  Okay, I'm gonna need to see some credentials.
[19:43.380 --> 19:44.220]  Well, I just wanna hang out
[19:44.220 --> 19:45.740]  because I've got some fucking issues.
[19:45.740 --> 19:46.580]  Yeah, actually.
[19:46.580 --> 19:47.400]  I got a website issue.
[19:47.400 --> 19:48.240]  We have a question.
[19:48.240 --> 19:49.080]  We have a stitcher problem
[19:49.080 --> 19:49.920]  that we're gonna address here in a moment.
[19:49.920 --> 19:52.100]  Can you send commenters questions?
[19:52.820 --> 19:54.980]  Hey, authority in all tech.
[19:54.980 --> 19:57.620]  Are you like tech law enforcement?
[19:57.620 --> 19:58.460]  I wanna know.
[19:58.460 --> 19:59.280]  Are you the guru?
[19:59.280 --> 20:00.120]  I wanna know.
[20:00.120 --> 20:01.300]  Anyway, he left a great review,
[20:01.300 --> 20:02.940]  so I'm gonna quit picking on him or she.
[20:02.940 --> 20:03.980]  I'm not sure.
[20:03.980 --> 20:05.220]  You gotta be fair these days.
[20:05.220 --> 20:06.820]  This person left a review and it says,
[20:06.820 --> 20:08.420]  very knowledgeable and easy to listen to.
[20:08.420 --> 20:09.860]  There is something for everyone
[20:09.860 --> 20:11.420]  from novice to master grower.
[20:11.420 --> 20:12.620]  Hey, that's what I'm aiming for.
[20:12.620 --> 20:14.300]  I want everybody to be involved.
[20:14.300 --> 20:16.020]  You may think you know all that you need to know,
[20:16.020 --> 20:18.140]  but Rasta Jeff will occasionally bring up insights
[20:18.140 --> 20:19.500]  you may have forgotten about.
[20:19.500 --> 20:20.860]  Great show.
[20:20.860 --> 20:21.700]  I see a theme here.
[20:22.100 --> 20:22.940]  I see a theme.
[20:22.940 --> 20:25.740]  People are noticing that I'm going back
[20:25.740 --> 20:27.660]  and kind of reteaching the basics again
[20:27.660 --> 20:28.940]  because I feel like a lot of people
[20:28.940 --> 20:30.860]  are too worried about turps, bro.
[20:30.860 --> 20:33.140]  Turps, let's squish it and get turps, bro.
[20:33.140 --> 20:33.980]  And we haven't even learned how
[20:33.980 --> 20:35.340]  to fucking grow good weed yet.
[20:35.340 --> 20:37.380]  Yep, start with the first step.
[20:37.380 --> 20:39.540]  Yeah, so I've been working on,
[20:39.540 --> 20:42.060]  I have got, and I could pull it up on the iPad here.
[20:42.060 --> 20:43.460]  I could show you, Mike, what I've got going on.
[20:43.460 --> 20:45.780]  I've got a nice series of episodes written.
[20:45.780 --> 20:47.540]  They're gonna start coming out very shortly.
[20:47.540 --> 20:49.340]  I've got a website issue that needs to be corrected
[20:49.340 --> 20:50.820]  as soon as that is fixed.
[20:51.340 --> 20:52.420]  I know I keep making excuses,
[20:52.420 --> 20:54.080]  but the website fucking fucked up yesterday.
[20:54.080 --> 20:55.780]  We'll get it fixed, don't worry.
[20:55.780 --> 20:56.860]  As soon as that's back up,
[20:56.860 --> 20:59.420]  my next goal is to start working on producing
[20:59.420 --> 21:02.820]  all these episodes in a row about growing.
[21:02.820 --> 21:04.820]  I'm gonna start with planning your grow.
[21:04.820 --> 21:05.660]  What's your purpose?
[21:05.660 --> 21:06.480]  And then we're gonna start with like-
[21:06.480 --> 21:08.780]  The grow series that you're putting together is intense.
[21:08.780 --> 21:10.260]  I can't wait for it.
[21:10.260 --> 21:11.100]  It's gonna be rad.
[21:11.100 --> 21:11.940]  I'm excited, I'm so excited for it.
[21:11.940 --> 21:13.820]  You're not gonna hear a lot of me rambling
[21:13.820 --> 21:14.740]  during that series.
[21:14.740 --> 21:16.620]  Right, you may not be here for a few weeks.
[21:16.620 --> 21:17.860]  I may just be head down into this series for a minute.
[21:17.860 --> 21:19.940]  I might show up, we'll take some dabs,
[21:19.940 --> 21:22.180]  then I'll leave and he'll record that kind of setup.
[21:22.180 --> 21:23.500]  Yeah, it's gonna be awesome.
[21:23.500 --> 21:25.460]  So I hope that you guys have noticed,
[21:25.460 --> 21:27.460]  I kind of went back into the drying and curing again
[21:27.460 --> 21:29.260]  because I'm trying to get back to the basics
[21:29.260 --> 21:31.020]  while also teaching the advanced techniques.
[21:31.020 --> 21:34.100]  I did drying and curing, I did harvesting, excuse me,
[21:34.100 --> 21:36.180]  and I also did carbohydrates and enzymes,
[21:36.180 --> 21:37.660]  which are a little more advanced learning.
[21:37.660 --> 21:40.100]  I liked the redo of some of those old episodes,
[21:40.100 --> 21:42.420]  it was like specifically with drying and curing.
[21:42.420 --> 21:44.660]  We've learned more about environments that aren't ours
[21:44.660 --> 21:47.500]  since that first killer dry and cure episode.
[21:47.500 --> 21:50.540]  We've probably been through three large scale grows
[21:50.540 --> 21:54.500]  and 100 medium scale grows and 20,000 small grows since then.
[21:54.500 --> 21:56.140]  Yeah, I'm exaggerating with 20,000,
[21:56.140 --> 21:58.780]  but yeah, I've been to a lot of grows, big and small.
[21:58.780 --> 22:01.460]  Is that first dry and cure was like what, episode 36?
[22:01.460 --> 22:02.820]  I've told so many people to go find it.
[22:02.820 --> 22:03.660]  I'm pretty sure that's right.
[22:03.660 --> 22:06.940]  It's around 36 or 72 or something like that, yeah.
[22:06.940 --> 22:09.300]  Yeah, we're at 350 now, we've learned a lot.
[22:09.300 --> 22:10.140]  So much.
[22:10.140 --> 22:11.100]  300 episodes.
[22:11.100 --> 22:12.980]  So much, oh my goodness.
[22:12.980 --> 22:14.500]  Yeah, and I'm not afraid to go back and say,
[22:14.500 --> 22:16.140]  hey, I was doing it wrong back in the day.
[22:16.580 --> 22:17.980]  Or we were doing it right back in the day
[22:17.980 --> 22:20.100]  and we've learned 10 important things since
[22:20.100 --> 22:21.780]  and now doing it right means.
[22:21.780 --> 22:23.500]  How many times have I flopped in and out of
[22:23.500 --> 22:25.620]  do and don't foliar feed your plants?
[22:25.620 --> 22:27.340]  Yeah, now I'm all about doing it again.
[22:27.340 --> 22:28.780]  Like let's foliar feed the plants.
[22:28.780 --> 22:30.400]  Put some push on there, they love it.
[22:30.400 --> 22:33.060]  Anyway, Authority and Alltech, bro, thanks for,
[22:33.060 --> 22:35.260]  or not bro, I'm not sure if this is a male or female,
[22:35.260 --> 22:38.380]  I've gotta stop addressing people as bro.
[22:38.380 --> 22:41.640]  Yeah, I gotta quit assuming it's 2018, they could be both.
[22:42.980 --> 22:44.200]  Thanks for the great review.
[22:44.200 --> 22:45.700]  Sorry to put that on you there like that.
[22:46.220 --> 22:48.260]  You're probably a fucking great person.
[22:48.260 --> 22:51.540]  I'm sorry to put the gender joke on in your comment there.
[22:51.540 --> 22:52.660]  But dude, thanks for the great comment.
[22:52.660 --> 22:53.620]  Thanks for thinking I'm the best.
[22:53.620 --> 22:55.580]  I find no competition, but for people to think
[22:55.580 --> 22:56.900]  I'm the best means a lot.
[22:56.900 --> 22:58.660]  So much respect, thank you.
[22:58.660 --> 23:01.940]  I do appreciate the review and I thank you for the listens.
[23:01.940 --> 23:04.040]  Now this is where it gets fun, you guys.
[23:04.040 --> 23:06.940]  This one was left on August 30th by another person.
[23:06.940 --> 23:08.220]  They call themselves Yolo Grower.
[23:08.220 --> 23:09.940]  Shout out to Yolo Grower.
[23:09.940 --> 23:11.620]  They left a two star review.
[23:11.620 --> 23:12.900]  Wah, wah, wah.
[23:12.900 --> 23:14.540]  They say disappointed.
[23:14.580 --> 23:16.060]  They're disappointed in us.
[23:16.060 --> 23:17.860]  That's worse than them being mad.
[23:17.860 --> 23:18.980]  You ain't my daddy.
[23:22.440 --> 23:24.640]  Try disappointed, oh please.
[23:24.640 --> 23:25.480]  All right.
[23:25.480 --> 23:26.300]  No, read it.
[23:26.300 --> 23:27.820]  Mike said read it, he's like, he's giving.
[23:27.820 --> 23:29.700]  I'm checking one of the facts thrown out.
[23:29.700 --> 23:32.580]  Did you just do a Zorro snap in a Z formation bro?
[23:32.580 --> 23:33.500]  Did you just fucking?
[23:33.500 --> 23:35.700]  That was a one handed air quote.
[23:35.700 --> 23:36.820]  It's sleep deprived.
[23:36.820 --> 23:39.140]  All right, so this review says disappointed.
[23:39.140 --> 23:40.500]  I'm gonna get serious and we're gonna read this.
[23:40.500 --> 23:43.260]  It says, used to be my favorite podcast
[23:43.260 --> 23:47.660]  I started listening. I listened to the old episodes since I didn't discover this podcast
[23:47.660 --> 23:52.700]  until almost episode 300. Great information in some episodes. Well, I'm glad you found
[23:52.700 --> 23:56.860]  some information in some. Some of them are just having fun. They can't all be fucking
[23:56.860 --> 24:02.460]  gold bro or sis. Then the episode continues, or the review continues. It says, lately,
[24:03.100 --> 24:07.740]  Rasta Jeff has been making inappropriate comments with his female guests and insulting Velcro
[24:07.740 --> 24:13.660]  shoe wearing people. The only female guest I can recall having in a long time is granny.
[24:13.660 --> 24:19.740]  See, here's the thing. I just scrolled back. I mean, stitches been messing with me a lot. So I
[24:19.740 --> 24:23.260]  didn't really want to reference the platform, but we're going to go back to episode 300.
[24:24.700 --> 24:30.380]  And I'm 99% sure there's not a female guest from 300. And now that's not
[24:31.500 --> 24:36.860]  the wonderful Miss Dabbing Granny. And if there were any inappropriate comments made while granny
[24:36.860 --> 24:41.980]  was on, granny was probably making them. Yeah, it was probably I was probably Yeah. And I don't
[24:41.980 --> 24:45.900]  even need to defend any inappropriate comments that may have been made when granny was on.
[24:45.900 --> 24:51.820]  It's just a really weird criticism. It's like making fun of my dreads. Like, go ahead. Now
[24:51.820 --> 24:55.420]  yourself out. I don't have any. Yeah, it's like making fun of my dreads. Like heard that. How
[24:55.420 --> 25:00.140]  can you be inappropriate with female guests if if I don't have to criticize him for not having
[25:00.140 --> 25:04.540]  enough female guests? That's fair. Maybe they're talking about the Instagram live feeds.
[25:04.540 --> 25:08.380]  That just dawned on me. I don't know if this is even relative to the podcast. But we'll leave this
[25:08.380 --> 25:12.460]  in here. Maybe they're talking about the Instagram live feeds on Instagram live feeds. We do. We do
[25:12.460 --> 25:19.020]  joke a lot. And maybe since some of my friends, my personal friends are in there that do press
[25:19.020 --> 25:23.260]  the boundaries. Maybe there is some shenanigans in there that people wouldn't approve of. But that is
[25:23.260 --> 25:28.380]  not like it was on a specific separate platform. The commenter would have referenced the platform.
[25:28.380 --> 25:32.300]  Well, if we read further into the comment, we'll realize that that may not be accurate. Okay,
[25:32.300 --> 25:35.500]  there's something in here that makes me think that what you just said may not be true. So
[25:36.620 --> 25:40.780]  I don't recall inappropriates on the podcast. Apologize if I hurt your little feelers.
[25:40.780 --> 25:45.180]  But if it was with granny, that's all in fun. So we're having fun. I don't think I said anything
[25:45.180 --> 25:50.940]  inappropriate with a female guest. I had Lindsay I had Shannon from CGC long times ago. I don't
[25:50.940 --> 25:56.380]  really hang out with Lindsay anymore. Shannon hasn't been on a long time. Maybe it was when
[25:56.380 --> 26:02.860]  Angela was here. That was like 100 episodes ago. But or more. Yeah, I don't even know what number
[26:02.860 --> 26:07.580]  that was. I was doesn't matter. We're putting way too much fucking thought into that moving forward.
[26:08.540 --> 26:13.820]  I apologize if somebody had their little feelers hurt. I apologize. But making fun of Velcro shoe
[26:13.820 --> 26:17.500]  wearing guests. I'm really thinking that this is somebody watching the Instagram live feeds,
[26:17.500 --> 26:21.420]  which are not the podcast. But still, if you're bothered by something I'm saying, that's cool.
[26:22.220 --> 26:25.900]  There's another podcast you can listen to check out the dude grow show. It's also free.
[26:25.980 --> 26:28.940]  They're probably still listening to the show. So they're going to hear this review. But anyway,
[26:28.940 --> 26:32.620]  inappropriate guests are inappropriate comments with the guests. Not too worried about that.
[26:32.620 --> 26:36.140]  Nobody else complained. They're the only one saying anything about it. The Velcro shoe part
[26:36.140 --> 26:40.140]  don't recall. But if you want to point it out, go for it. I'll listen. Then he said the podcast is
[26:40.140 --> 26:45.900]  also not been reliable lately. You can't hear half the podcast sometimes even though he always
[26:45.900 --> 26:50.540]  talks about how he found the issue and fixed it. Now see, that's what makes me think that they're
[26:50.540 --> 26:55.100]  complaining about the wrong platform because the issue is on Stitcher.
[26:56.540 --> 27:01.100]  That issue is definitely a Stitcher issue. And this is most definitely an iTunes comment.
[27:01.100 --> 27:04.860]  Yeah, that issue is happening on Stitcher. And he's saying that he can't listen to be
[27:04.860 --> 27:08.620]  talking about multiple platforms. Yeah, yeah. And this comment's happening here on iTunes.
[27:09.260 --> 27:12.940]  And there's obviously not a problem on iTunes because nobody else on iTunes has said,
[27:12.940 --> 27:15.740]  hey, there's not a problem. And I actually go back and listen to my own show on iTunes
[27:15.740 --> 27:19.980]  occasionally just to make sure I can listen to my own show on Stitcher as well, because
[27:19.980 --> 27:23.820]  the problem doesn't happen for me, which is why I didn't know about it. It happens to people with
[27:23.820 --> 27:27.900]  Android devices. So I have no way of knowing if it's happening or not. I have to call Mike or get
[27:27.900 --> 27:31.020]  a message from somebody else. And they say, Stitcher, fuck me. As soon as I notice it,
[27:31.020 --> 27:36.540]  because I'm an Android Stitcher user. So I shoot him a text as soon as I notice. But
[27:37.500 --> 27:41.580]  sometimes that's Wednesday. But he says, I talked about how I found the issue and fixed it.
[27:41.580 --> 27:46.140]  And he says, I'm disappointed in you, Jeff. Like I said, used to be great. So this person's
[27:46.140 --> 27:53.820]  disappointed in me. I'll be OK. I'm doing all right. But let's address this Stitcher issue.
[27:54.380 --> 27:58.940]  I've been working with techs from Stitcher. I've Richard and somebody else, I think, are their
[27:58.940 --> 28:02.460]  names. I'm emailing with two guys. I'm not calling them out. We can't figure it out.
[28:03.340 --> 28:08.300]  It happened when it happened three episodes into after having the new MacBook is when the issue
[28:08.300 --> 28:12.940]  started. So we're wondering if there's something with the conversion here. But then we corrected
[28:12.940 --> 28:18.300]  that. I did all of the things that they asked. I uploaded a new file. It worked the next time.
[28:18.300 --> 28:22.140]  Same exact thing. It's hit and miss. It didn't work. It's not something that's happening with
[28:22.140 --> 28:26.060]  every scrolling through my they're listening to my episodes and like looking at my files and shit
[28:26.060 --> 28:31.260]  to see what's going on. Neither one of us can find an issue. I've got the Stitcher team working on
[28:31.260 --> 28:34.060]  it. The people that made Stitcher, the people that built that machine, they don't know why
[28:34.060 --> 28:40.060]  it's fucking up. So if they can't figure it out, I know I can't write. I know it's not an issue
[28:40.060 --> 28:44.380]  with what you're uploading because it uploads smooth, smoothly to other platforms. Yeah,
[28:44.380 --> 28:48.460]  it's every other platform. It works. It's just Stitcher that's having issues. It all goes to
[28:48.460 --> 28:54.860]  the same RSS feed. Honestly, I loaded up one time and it goes to like feed burner, cast box,
[28:54.860 --> 29:00.220]  iTunes, Stitcher, wherever else it goes. It goes through the one RSS feed. That's on RSS feed
[29:00.220 --> 29:03.340]  works. You just go to a place, you register your RSS feed. And every time you put something else
[29:03.340 --> 29:08.060]  in it, that place picks it up and puts it into your device somehow or not. The whole bit technology
[29:08.060 --> 29:11.980]  works, but you just have one RSS feed other than YouTube. YouTube, I have to make a separate video
[29:11.980 --> 29:17.660]  for because it's a video, not audio. So it works on everything but Stitcher. So if you can't,
[29:18.620 --> 29:22.060]  you've obviously found it because you're listening on iTunes. So quick complaint and dude,
[29:22.060 --> 29:25.740]  you're still listening to the show. You just want to leave a negative fucking review and be a troll.
[29:26.620 --> 29:31.340]  America. Anyway, he said, like I said, it used to be great. Don't worry, bro. If you're not happy
[29:31.340 --> 29:34.540]  with what you're getting, you can listen to the Adam Dunn show. You can listen to the dude grow
[29:34.540 --> 29:40.380]  show. There's a 28 marijuana today daily with Shea Gunther. It's a great fucking show. Dude
[29:40.380 --> 29:44.300]  shaping fire with shango. Lowe's is a great show. Those are all shows I can recommend for you.
[29:44.300 --> 29:48.140]  There are probably 12 more that I just can't think of off the top of my head because I'm on the spot.
[29:48.140 --> 29:53.180]  But listen to those. Oh, anybody listening to fucking cannabis grow podcast. Here's a great
[29:53.180 --> 29:58.620]  plug to cannabis innovation and sciences with Tad Hussey. Listen to that one. If you don't enjoy
[29:58.620 --> 30:02.700]  mine anymore. There you go. Shout outs. Even if you do enjoy my listen to that, because dude,
[30:02.700 --> 30:07.500]  you learn so fucking much, right? Spread knowledge is what this is all about. Let's get out of this
[30:07.500 --> 30:11.980]  loop of this negative review. I feel like we've given way too much time to a negative review.
[30:11.980 --> 30:15.420]  That's we shouldn't have gone that far. But shout out to yellow grower. Thanks for being honest.
[30:15.420 --> 30:20.700]  I'm sorry. I'm not living up to your standards. I said some things that bothered you. I can't make
[30:20.700 --> 30:26.060]  everybody happy and I'm just being me. So sorry. Maybe we won't take the ads together as always.
[30:26.060 --> 30:30.300]  Send hate mail to at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter. He already sent his fucking hate mail. It's right
[30:30.300 --> 30:35.980]  here in a public forum, whatever. Moving forward. You guys, if you've got reviews, positive or
[30:35.980 --> 30:40.700]  negative, you can send them to go to iTunes. All you have to do is go to the podcast on iTunes.
[30:40.700 --> 30:44.780]  Like just like you're going to listen to the show. And if you scroll, if you hit available episodes
[30:44.780 --> 30:48.860]  and then scroll, it'll show best of the podcast. And then you keep scrolling and then ratings and
[30:48.860 --> 30:54.300]  reviews will pop up right underneath. You'll see the first, it'll say ratings and reviews.
[30:54.300 --> 30:59.580]  That'll show 5.0. Cause so far I've got an average of 5.0 stars. Click on how many stars you feel I
[30:59.580 --> 31:03.420]  deserve. Be honest. Honestly, I could obviously I could deal with the honesty. I ain't afraid.
[31:03.420 --> 31:06.780]  Then right underneath that is write a review. Go ahead and type in a review. Let me know what you
[31:06.780 --> 31:11.500]  think of the show and I will read your review on a future episode. And I do appreciate everybody
[31:11.500 --> 31:16.860]  who has left a review in the past, positive or negative. Thank you. I've got love for all of you.
[31:16.860 --> 31:20.540]  So let's move forward. I want to give a huge shout out to a guy named James Butterson.
[31:20.540 --> 31:26.220]  You guys, every time I post a YouTube video, our buddy James Butterson is all over it. Giving me
[31:26.220 --> 31:31.420]  credit, giving me thanks, giving me praise, uh, giving me cool ass emojis. So big shout out to
[31:31.420 --> 31:36.700]  James Butterson for all the support. Shout out, much respect. I do appreciate that because we've
[31:36.700 --> 31:41.260]  been talking for a long freaking time. We haven't talked much about cannabis. Mike, you want to talk
[31:41.260 --> 31:46.620]  about some cannabis? I think we should. I think we should. That was very, uh, it's a moral imperative.
[31:48.300 --> 31:51.740]  Why you just got fucking serious on me. You're going to need to take a dab. Just
[31:51.820 --> 31:55.660]  channeling some Val Kilmer. All right. That felt more Sheldon Cooper to me, but
[31:56.540 --> 32:02.060]  real geniuses, man. You got to go back. Uh, so we've covered all that stuff, right? I can put a
[32:02.060 --> 32:06.380]  check mark right there. Boom. Let's get to the fun part of the show. Um, if you're still listening,
[32:06.380 --> 32:10.140]  thank you. I love you. It's episode three 50. Mike's here. We got highest shit. Uh, it's not
[32:10.140 --> 32:14.700]  one of those super informative episodes. This is one of the more, uh, education and conversation
[32:14.700 --> 32:19.980]  sort of episodes. Mike's nodding his head. That doesn't work on a podcast, bro. I know. Put some
[32:19.980 --> 32:28.140]  rocks in your mouth so we can hear, um, a while back, a few people have asked me not a while back
[32:28.140 --> 32:34.700]  over time. Several people have asked me what my favorite strain is and being a breeder and having
[32:34.700 --> 32:40.620]  grown for so long, selecting one strain to be my favorite is like asking Mike to pick which of his
[32:40.620 --> 32:48.060]  two kids is his favorite. Oh, he knows that's fucked up. This is just like last night. It's
[32:49.020 --> 32:53.660]  don't say it. If you caught me two days ago, this would have been a hard choice. They may
[32:53.660 --> 33:00.060]  listen one day. Don't say it, but no, honestly, you guys, but I have bred. I'm not trying to,
[33:00.060 --> 33:03.980]  I don't want to boast. This isn't a brag full thing I have worked with. And it's easiest to
[33:03.980 --> 33:08.220]  keep track of how many strains I've read by thinking of the males I have used. Right. I
[33:08.220 --> 33:12.780]  used grateful dog for commercial production. I use the King Kim grape stomper, OG mail for
[33:12.780 --> 33:17.100]  commercial production. I use the daybreaker mail for commercial production. I've used the arise
[33:17.100 --> 33:21.980]  mail for commercial production. Plus there was a reversed golden goat that didn't do a lot of
[33:21.980 --> 33:27.980]  projects, but it did make the golden goat feminized seeds and it made the lemon Jeffrey. There was a
[33:27.980 --> 33:34.060]  strawberry diesel project a long time ago that didn't go anywhere other than a couple of people.
[33:35.100 --> 33:40.620]  There was a lemon cushroom, the lemon cush that I bred custom job for that one person.
[33:42.140 --> 33:46.540]  Was that a strawberry diesel? Yeah, yeah, it was. I never knew the strain that went into it,
[33:46.540 --> 33:50.300]  which is why I asked. Oh yeah. Yeah. See, see guys, even Mike doesn't know some of this stuff.
[33:50.300 --> 33:55.100]  Yeah. And then those seeds got sent to somebody in another state and then they got rated with those
[33:55.100 --> 33:58.700]  plants growing. And the DEA said that those were the best plants they've ever seen. He's like,
[33:58.700 --> 34:02.780]  this is the most amazing cannabis plants we've ever seen is what the dude told me that the DEA
[34:02.780 --> 34:10.460]  said, but I don't know. Maybe anyway, where the shit was. I just something fun to say. I've read
[34:10.460 --> 34:14.380]  a lot of stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I've read a lot of stuff is what I'm saying. And so I've got a lot
[34:14.380 --> 34:19.100]  of things to choose from. The lemon sorbet is amazing, which somebody has taken the name of it
[34:19.100 --> 34:22.620]  because I never released it. I bred it and I gave a few seeds out to a few friends of mine. I never
[34:22.620 --> 34:26.940]  really released it. I called it the lemon sorbet. It wasn't official. Somebody took that name. They
[34:26.940 --> 34:31.820]  put it to market. That's cool. That one, what I was calling lemon sorbet was the grateful dog and
[34:31.820 --> 34:36.940]  lemon Jeffrey. That was fucking tremendous. That'll probably never be released because that's
[34:36.940 --> 34:41.660]  a pain in the ass to make. It doesn't make enough seeds when you breed with it. But I made a lot of
[34:41.660 --> 34:47.980]  great things. Black cherry chem scarlet begonias arise. There's a lot of great stuff to choose from
[34:47.980 --> 34:54.140]  capelton kalonji burning spear. The one that I called coffee cake for a while that nobody got
[34:54.140 --> 34:58.620]  to see which is daybreaker and forum cookies. Like there was a lot of private stuff that stayed
[34:58.620 --> 35:02.300]  around here that didn't go anywhere. There were some chem crosses that didn't go anywhere.
[35:03.100 --> 35:06.460]  There were a bunch of grateful dog crosses that we just got to try in house.
[35:07.180 --> 35:13.020]  There's chem four to arise that's never been grown. I've got chem four to arise that has never
[35:13.020 --> 35:18.460]  even happened. Yeah. So what my point is- Picking a favorites a bit is what we're getting at folks.
[35:18.460 --> 35:21.820]  Yeah, that's my point. You want me to pick a favorite out of all of those? That's hard to do.
[35:21.820 --> 35:24.380]  Pick your favorite Wednesday. It's hard.
[35:25.180 --> 35:29.660]  I narrowed it down to three favorites just because I kind of put them into categories and I chose
[35:29.660 --> 35:33.420]  three that I bred just because it made it a little easier for me. If I want to step out
[35:33.420 --> 35:37.900]  and mention something of other breeders of stuff that I did not breed, I would have to go
[35:37.900 --> 35:43.980]  with DNA genetics is holy grail kush. A lot of the DNA genetics kushes. I love all of those.
[35:44.940 --> 35:51.340]  I know a lot of people are haters, but back in the day I had a clone or I grew from seed. I had a
[35:51.340 --> 35:57.580]  plant of vortex that was fucking awesome. There are several other breeders that put out great
[35:57.580 --> 36:07.100]  stuff. I had some Cali connection stuff that was fucking rad. That sour OG. But anyway, so the holy
[36:07.100 --> 36:11.180]  grail kush, the sour OG and that vortex a long time ago are probably some of the best that I've
[36:11.180 --> 36:17.660]  grown. The P91 is some of the best we'd I've ever smoked. But anyway, my three favorites that I have
[36:17.660 --> 36:22.540]  bred, I keep building up the hype just because I'm good at that. I'm going to go with the grateful
[36:22.540 --> 36:25.740]  dog and we'll talk about the grateful dog for a minute. Mike, I should have asked you your three
[36:25.740 --> 36:29.420]  favorites first. That would have been more fair. I know that the grateful dog is on my list for
[36:29.420 --> 36:33.100]  sure. That's what, so let's talk about your three favorites. This is, I'm just building it up even
[36:33.100 --> 36:35.980]  better and better and better. So let's talk about your three favorites and then we'll get into Mike's.
[36:35.980 --> 36:40.700]  I've got them written down. So the grateful dog is definitely on my list. It's just an absolutely
[36:40.700 --> 36:49.340]  phenomenal strain, wonderful stone. And it almost instantly takes my back pain away. Almost instantly.
[36:49.820 --> 36:56.860]  It's wonderful. And my original favorite was a sour diesel or a New York city sour diesel.
[36:58.140 --> 37:03.580]  There's a lot of imitations now. It's hard to find. Yeah. But that one that used to go around
[37:03.580 --> 37:08.540]  here that you could put in a baggie in a jar in your backpack, in the back of the car and the car
[37:08.540 --> 37:14.540]  next to you would go, bro, you have that diesel in there. Yeah. Yeah. There are a couple of different
[37:14.540 --> 37:20.780]  spots around Colorado where you could get that. I think I still, that's what I still, when I say
[37:20.780 --> 37:24.940]  sour diesel, that's what I'm picturing. The cut that you're familiar with around here is also
[37:24.940 --> 37:31.420]  known as the gardener diesel and it smells amazing. If you're in an illegal area, that is
[37:31.420 --> 37:35.900]  not the strain to grow. Nope. If you're in an illegal place, that is not the strain to smoke.
[37:35.900 --> 37:41.740]  It is troublesome. So we got the grateful dog, which I'm going to talk about why that's a good
[37:41.740 --> 37:46.620]  strain. The sour diesel, that original sour. And I know why you love that one. Uh, when I smoked
[37:46.620 --> 37:51.820]  that one, it makes my eyes squint and itch and like all kinds of weird shit. And it makes my
[37:51.820 --> 37:57.180]  body tingle. It makes me too high. It gets me right in the eyes every time. Yeah. The ice squint is
[37:57.180 --> 38:03.900]  definitely a dominant in that one. And then for number three, it's, it's a tough choice, but I
[38:03.900 --> 38:09.420]  have to go with something lemony, like a super sour lemon or a super lemon Hays. Okay. You've
[38:09.420 --> 38:15.100]  always been a fan of that lemony stuff. Yep. Yeah. Lemon candy flavor. I mean, even if it's a real
[38:15.100 --> 38:19.500]  light back flavor in the year, that's in my wheelhouse for sure. All right. I like that.
[38:20.060 --> 38:29.260]  Um, so we got the grateful dog for that pungentness and the effect that sour D breakfast herb. Yeah.
[38:29.260 --> 38:33.980]  You got the sour D which is that, that face or 40. I know what you mean by that. And then something
[38:33.980 --> 38:38.620]  lemony, which was probably more for your uplifting kind of a breakfasty sort of a thing. All right.
[38:38.620 --> 38:41.420]  What are you smoking when you're trying to calm down and chill out? Cause it sounds like everything
[38:41.420 --> 38:46.860]  you talked about. Okay. Yeah. That's end of the day. Relax, calm down, put your feet up. And that's
[38:46.860 --> 38:51.100]  cause it's got a, we'll talk about grateful dog here in a second. That's cause it's got the SFVOG.
[38:51.100 --> 38:57.340]  It's got San Fernando Valley OG cushion there. Um, I've been doing a lot of, uh, what is it?
[38:57.340 --> 39:04.540]  The Colin OG, the white Walker. Oh yeah. That's, um, that's grateful dog flow and sour D.
[39:04.620 --> 39:09.500]  The other name or the other straight name right now, but a lot of the, just the heavier
[39:09.500 --> 39:13.580]  indica is in the evening. Okay. That seems to be working for people with an OG to it.
[39:13.580 --> 39:19.340]  Uh, I've got some, uh, Kim D I 95 flowers and they seem to make me like drowsy.
[39:19.900 --> 39:24.220]  Yeah. That's not productive or I got some of that as well. Yeah. That's good. Or good,
[39:24.220 --> 39:27.660]  good herb, even though it's not good or forgetting the shit. Shout out to the people down the street
[39:27.660 --> 39:33.660]  with that. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Thank you. Uh, people down the street. I mean, the people that
[39:33.660 --> 39:39.420]  own the legal dispensary down the road. Yes. Good work guys. Good work. They know who they are.
[39:39.420 --> 39:45.900]  They're listening. Yeah. I figured they would be. Um, so, uh, the reason that I, uh, switched over
[39:45.900 --> 39:48.940]  to Mike is because I knew that we would agree with the grateful dog. The grateful dog is one
[39:48.940 --> 39:53.820]  of my top three favorites. I bred the grateful dog. That is, uh, so the grateful dog is the,
[39:53.820 --> 40:03.100]  it's SFV it's chem 91, the skunk VA cut cross to San Fernando Valley OG, Kush F4 to make deadhead OG.
[40:03.660 --> 40:10.220]  I selected my favorite cut out of that. That was number nine. That one got reversed and made
[40:10.220 --> 40:16.860]  seeds out of, what are we going to say? The Fino hunt for this is one of my most enjoyable projects
[40:16.860 --> 40:20.940]  that I've ever done with Jeff. That was true. I mean, there were like 20 different jars.
[40:21.660 --> 40:27.820]  He set up, there were a bunch of us that got, uh, if you ever did like watercolor colors in like
[40:27.820 --> 40:32.700]  third grade, you get these little plastic cups of paint and he popped a little plastic lid off each
[40:32.700 --> 40:38.140]  one. We got those with like a quarter gram of every different strain. And then you got to narrow
[40:38.140 --> 40:43.820]  it down from there. We then we all got together with our own selection lists, went through each
[40:43.820 --> 40:51.180]  one again. Like we were incredibly thorough. That was so much fun. And so many of those were good.
[40:52.140 --> 40:58.780]  And then going back after I made the S1 seeds to go find more of those was even more fun.
[40:58.780 --> 41:04.700]  It's just, I mean, it was like a year and a half worth of work picking just the winners out of that
[41:04.700 --> 41:09.260]  first run. Yeah. Yeah. Well, because Kevin was involved, pops was involved. You were involved.
[41:09.260 --> 41:14.700]  There were a lot of people, at least a half dozen of us testing Fino's and testing all the different,
[41:14.700 --> 41:18.300]  what, which one do you like the best, bro? And everybody came back on the same one eventually.
[41:19.580 --> 41:24.140]  Yeah. That was the fun part. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to talk about what they all got named,
[41:24.140 --> 41:30.380]  but no need to go down that route. So it was, number nine was selfed, which made, and see,
[41:31.180 --> 41:36.620]  this is where the brain injury messes with me, but I don't remember if I called that one GD77 or just
[41:36.620 --> 41:41.100]  GD because there was a GD77 and a GD. Now they've all just become the grateful dog because there's
[41:41.100 --> 41:46.620]  only one left in there. They've all been called other than the keeper. So there was, number nine
[41:46.620 --> 41:51.420]  was selfed and it made the grateful dog 77. And then, no, it made the grateful dog because I
[41:51.420 --> 41:56.700]  didn't need the number 77 on the end of it yet to identify anything. So I took number nine,
[41:56.700 --> 42:02.380]  I selfed it, and that made the grateful dog. Then I took the pollen from number nine and I put that
[42:02.380 --> 42:08.620]  on the grateful dog and that's what made 77. And that's the one I'm working with now. And nobody's,
[42:08.620 --> 42:13.580]  not a lot of people have heard the 77 part, but when there were, 77 is my favorite year of the
[42:13.580 --> 42:20.140]  Grateful Dead. There was 72, 77, a few other years, or that's why it got 77. So that's why
[42:20.140 --> 42:26.700]  I denoted this specific plant as GD77. I remember right after we finished this project, or you
[42:26.700 --> 42:31.980]  finished this project, somebody was like, it's just the pheno of Deadhead. And I was like, and
[42:31.980 --> 42:36.940]  like two years worth of a bunch of people's lives and a lot of dedication and work. That's kind of
[42:36.940 --> 42:41.500]  why I don't even bring it up sometimes. But now I'm comfortable with it. It's so simplistic. Now
[42:41.500 --> 42:46.940]  I'm comfortable with it. I'm over all that crap. I've passed that insecure crap, I guess. I just
[42:46.940 --> 42:51.500]  read a fucking negative comment and laughed my way through it. So I think I'm having fun with
[42:51.500 --> 42:55.260]  life. I'm doing things. Okay. All right. So that's your first strain. What's your second strain?
[42:55.260 --> 42:59.180]  Uh, so dude, I want to talk about the Grateful Dead just for a couple more seconds. Uh, the
[42:59.180 --> 43:05.180]  grateful dog. I, I took that first one to a party and a couple of people here at the house had
[43:05.180 --> 43:11.500]  smoked it. Like, but we're all, you guys are all my best friends and I'm growing because you guys,
[43:11.500 --> 43:15.820]  I was also your caregiver, right? So I was your number one choice for herb. I was what you were
[43:15.820 --> 43:19.260]  familiar with. It was like going to your favorite restaurant and getting your favorite order. You
[43:19.260 --> 43:23.580]  know what you're going to get every time I knew you guys were, it was like being, it was like
[43:23.580 --> 43:28.060]  being fucking Joe Rogan at the comedy store. I could walk up there and just pull one nut out of
[43:28.060 --> 43:31.980]  my pants and everybody will laugh for 45 fucking minutes. Cause I'm Joe Rogan at the comedy store.
[43:31.980 --> 43:35.740]  I could put my ball back away and walk off stage and everyone will go, he fucking killed it.
[43:35.740 --> 43:39.180]  So you guys were an easy audience for me. No offense to you guys, but you guys were going
[43:39.180 --> 43:43.900]  to be happy because I knew how to cater to you. I took that weed to another party of people that I
[43:43.900 --> 43:48.860]  don't like. I'm not always around and they don't always smoke weed and into the party people are
[43:48.860 --> 43:52.780]  drinking and a couple of guys, anybody got any weed? And I was like, I got a little bit of weed.
[43:52.780 --> 43:55.820]  I got a bunch of weed and socially I get a little bit of weed and pull out some fucking weed and
[43:55.820 --> 44:00.060]  smoke. I reached into my pocket and I pull out a little jar of grateful dog of the one that I'm
[44:00.060 --> 44:04.940]  working with. And I cracked the lid open and everybody in that fucking party gathered around.
[44:04.940 --> 44:08.620]  They're like, what the fuck? And as soon as I broke that bud open, they're like, that's like
[44:08.620 --> 44:12.780]  the best weed ever. That was when I knew I had something magical. I was like, wow, even people
[44:12.780 --> 44:17.340]  that like, they have no reason to care to tell me it's good weed, but they're all, they want to
[44:17.340 --> 44:21.100]  smoke. They're around. So that's when I was like, yeah, I got something special here. Like I already
[44:21.100 --> 44:26.620]  knew, but maybe for me, but I didn't know other people were going to love it too. I used to dread
[44:27.180 --> 44:30.540]  grateful dead or grateful dog harvest. Now you've got me fucking saying, yeah,
[44:31.500 --> 44:38.860]  because you get home and you'd have to shower like head to toe four times just to get some of the
[44:38.860 --> 44:45.340]  smell out of your skin. It's like dirty feet. It would just bury itself in skunks. And yeah,
[44:45.340 --> 44:49.900]  it was so disgustingly good. So we'll move forward. We've talked about grateful dog enough.
[44:49.900 --> 44:53.020]  I can tell you guys are bored with that one. Lemon Jeffrey is the next one on my list. Lemon
[44:53.020 --> 44:58.860]  Jeffrey is a cross of a it's lemon skunk from greenhouse seeds. That lemon skunk is a fun plant
[44:58.860 --> 45:02.060]  to grow, but it doesn't, we've talked about it on the show. It doesn't put out enough weight. It
[45:02.060 --> 45:09.260]  puts out long skinny buds that smell like fucking lemony soft candy and ice cream. It's so good.
[45:09.260 --> 45:14.220]  It's got a really sweet candy smell. I just don't, I'm not a huge fan of the way it grows. So I
[45:14.220 --> 45:20.540]  reversed golden goat and I put the reversed golden goat pollen on the lemon skunk to make lemon
[45:20.540 --> 45:27.420]  Jeffrey. And it makes these big beefy arm size, but huge, huge buds. You can beat someone with
[45:27.420 --> 45:36.140]  them. Please don't. Uh, but, and they, or make that person me. The, the aroma is so sweet and
[45:36.140 --> 45:41.100]  the buds are so sticky and the high is exactly what I wanted at the time when I made it. Like
[45:41.100 --> 45:45.180]  when I smoke lemon Jeffrey, if I'm like, if you, you know, some days you wake up, you're like,
[45:45.180 --> 45:48.540]  ah, shit, where are my keys? Where the fuck, what do I got to do? What's going on today?
[45:48.540 --> 45:52.620]  Smoke lemon Jeffrey and all the what's going on today. It all comes together. It's like, yeah,
[45:52.620 --> 45:55.580]  I'm going to get my keys. I'm gonna get my shoes. I'm going to get in the car. I'm gonna drive to
[45:55.580 --> 45:58.780]  the gas station. I'm gonna get gas. Then I'm going to go kick today's ass. It all just comes
[45:58.780 --> 46:04.140]  together when he smoked the lemon Jeff. So I love the flavor. I love the way it grows.
[46:04.780 --> 46:08.780]  And I love the high from it. I talk about the high from lemon Jeff all the time. The high is the
[46:08.780 --> 46:13.260]  total opposite of the grateful dog. The grateful dog makes me go. And I'm like by myself, once I
[46:13.260 --> 46:16.620]  smoked the grateful dog, I get like, you know, those things they put on horses at parade. So
[46:16.620 --> 46:20.540]  the horses can't see the blinders. I get those when I, where are you going to lean in and say,
[46:20.540 --> 46:25.500]  no, yeah, he started making the, I guess would be the hand motion for blinders and covering the
[46:25.500 --> 46:28.860]  sides of his eyes. And I leaned into the mic to say blinders when we finally got it. It was,
[46:28.860 --> 46:32.540]  yeah, I was thinking of the word, but I feel like I got those on when I spoke the grateful dog. I
[46:32.540 --> 46:36.460]  just get into this little bubble. I'm just like by myself, you can't mess with me. So if I want
[46:36.460 --> 46:40.300]  to write a podcast or write music or something, that's the stuff to go with the hood on the hoodie
[46:40.300 --> 46:46.620]  comes up. Yeah, yeah. Lemon Jeffrey, fucking take off the sunglasses and want to talk to everybody
[46:46.620 --> 46:51.100]  like, what's up guys, I'm ready to go. Like, that's like, if you were a medical patient and
[46:51.100 --> 46:55.820]  you needed a boost for work, maybe in your employment wasn't where you could get fucking,
[46:55.820 --> 46:59.580]  if you want to wake and bake and go to work stoned lemon, Jeffrey's the shit to smoke. That's
[46:59.580 --> 47:04.540]  the way to say it. Not gonna disagree. So then we'll move forward to my number three choice. You
[47:04.540 --> 47:09.020]  guys are probably wondering why I haven't said this one yet. It's one of my proudest creations
[47:09.020 --> 47:15.020]  because it has the potency, the flavor, it grows like a fucking champ. It breeds like a goddamn
[47:15.020 --> 47:20.540]  soldier. And it to the best of my knowledge, for quite a while, if not still it held the record
[47:20.540 --> 47:27.900]  for highest THC potency lab tests with steep Hill labs. It was at 34.8% is what I think I read
[47:27.900 --> 47:34.060]  correctly. I don't want to be wrong, but I think it's 34.8% THC a, and that is my strain arise.
[47:34.060 --> 47:39.820]  That is a golden goat female that was pollinated by a daybreaker male. I've done an entire episode
[47:39.820 --> 47:45.980]  about arise. If you want to hear a lot of details, listen to the arise episode, also go to leafly
[47:45.980 --> 47:50.380]  and leave a review on arise. Leafly doesn't have a rise posted yet, but if enough of us leave
[47:50.380 --> 47:54.060]  a review on the product, they will post it up there. So let's get a rise up on leafly, but
[47:54.060 --> 47:57.100]  lemon Jeffrey's already up there. The grateful dog, no need to get it. Their seeds aren't available.
[47:57.100 --> 48:01.820]  That would just make people angry. Uh, but the rise, we need to get that up there, but arises
[48:01.820 --> 48:08.300]  one of my favorites because being a breeder, I saw two plants that were so far apart that I was like,
[48:08.300 --> 48:12.860]  Ooh, like that's what you kind of look for as a breeder. What's the point of mixing chocolate
[48:12.860 --> 48:16.300]  and chocolate. You're going to get chocolatey chocolate. And that's, I never understood the
[48:16.300 --> 48:21.420]  point. So I took is vanilla vanilla as I could get, which is, I'm going to say that's the golden
[48:21.420 --> 48:27.340]  goat. That's that tropical. It almost tastes like a juicy fruit gum with a Hawaiian pineapple,
[48:27.340 --> 48:32.300]  sort of a flavor and some oranges and some citrus. And then I crossed that one too. We'll call it
[48:32.300 --> 48:38.140]  the chocolate version. The dark, dark chocolate would be my daybreaker male, which was featy and
[48:38.140 --> 48:43.100]  fueling and just smelled like dirt. And it was the exact opposite. The golden goats got these skinny
[48:43.100 --> 48:48.060]  leaves and it's tall and skinny in that daybreaker had those fat leaves and grew that cushy, stretchy
[48:48.060 --> 48:53.580]  structure. And I was like, that right there is how you make a nice swirl. You know what I mean? You
[48:53.580 --> 48:57.980]  don't just get dark chocolate or just bright white vanilla. I'm going to get, I'm going to see, I'm
[48:57.980 --> 49:01.020]  going to be able to mix in that chocolate and vanilla mixture right there. And I'm going to
[49:01.020 --> 49:06.300]  see traits of both. And I nailed it. Like a rise gave me exactly what I was looking for. Yeah.
[49:06.300 --> 49:10.540]  The leaves are the shape. I thought they were going to be the plants grow the way I had totally
[49:10.540 --> 49:15.100]  anticipated the aromas were what I expected. It was like a chef going Oh, if you put in this so
[49:15.100 --> 49:19.180]  much of this on this much of this you'll make the best and it came out the best. It was fucking
[49:19.180 --> 49:25.580]  beautiful. Like Pam or whatever fucking emerald that shit to death and I did a fucking good job.
[49:26.700 --> 49:30.060]  Yeah, I haven't watched the food network in a long time. What was that one girl who's really
[49:30.060 --> 49:37.180]  beautiful? I picture that was way to Rama joke guy with the forearms. That's that's who I was
[49:37.180 --> 49:44.700]  picture just now. So what plants crave? All right, you guys, but the rise is a fucking
[49:44.700 --> 49:51.740]  Brando on a brother. The world is becoming idiocracy. Unfortunately, God is close. It's
[49:51.740 --> 49:56.140]  close. It said when I don't do don't get me started. We're gonna do another two hours on
[49:56.140 --> 50:01.980]  why everything's fucked. Now let's talk about cannabis more arise. I love the arise. Yeah,
[50:01.980 --> 50:06.780]  it's high potency. Good flavor. Good aroma. It's a great breeder. I breed with an arise male and
[50:06.780 --> 50:12.380]  everything. I've got a very unique arise male. It took me a lot of seeds to find that male.
[50:13.180 --> 50:16.540]  Not saying that you won't find a good one if you try and go for it. If you want to breed with my
[50:16.540 --> 50:21.420]  stuff, I encourage you but the one I found I went through a lot of packs of seeds to find I went
[50:21.420 --> 50:26.300]  through a jar of fucking seeds to find this one. And the way we do it as read I'd run 10 and I'd
[50:26.300 --> 50:30.940]  be like, pull all the girls and I probably got five boys like that boy right there is the stud.
[50:30.940 --> 50:36.300]  Let's run 10 more seeds and pull all the girls out. Keep those other five boys gone. And I got
[50:36.300 --> 50:40.780]  those five boys. That one right there is a stud. So now I have to stand next to each other. And I
[50:40.780 --> 50:44.620]  filled up the tent until I had the whole tent filled with people that were running a second
[50:44.620 --> 50:48.860]  time. And then I ran on the second side. Yeah, check those out. And then I would just Nope,
[50:48.860 --> 50:52.860]  not yet. Not yet. And then finally, I found that one. And I was like, dude, look what this fucker
[50:52.860 --> 50:57.900]  does. And he had a top his top Cola was the whole plant. And it was like six feet long. And it was
[50:57.900 --> 51:01.980]  just all coated and big chunky bud sites. And I was like, that's that's a breeder male right there,
[51:01.980 --> 51:09.740]  bro. So he has done some work arise. The one I've got King Solomon is a stud. Everything I put
[51:09.740 --> 51:15.100]  that pollen on. Just it wins. It becomes a great fucking plant. It makes great progeny. And it
[51:15.100 --> 51:22.140]  doesn't dominate so much to where it's all arise. It puts it puts the potency, the vigor, the growth
[51:22.140 --> 51:27.100]  and the resistance in there that PM resistance. It puts that in there. But then you get the flavors
[51:27.100 --> 51:32.300]  and the aromas from the mom still so it's pretty nice. Great breeder so grateful dog lemon Jeffrey
[51:32.300 --> 51:38.300]  and arise. Those are my three favorites. Mike went with the grateful dog, the sour diesel and something
[51:38.300 --> 51:43.260]  lemony probably super lemon haze. I think that may be because you trimmed super lemon haze for so long
[51:43.260 --> 51:49.660]  for years associates like hundreds of different phenos for people so it's just comfortable for a
[51:49.660 --> 51:55.820]  lot. It's like going home. But that that flavor it's it's like a smell from childhood or something.
[51:56.140 --> 52:02.460]  I like it when it's in my life. So scientists have done research and the most addictive
[52:02.460 --> 52:06.940]  terpene. It's a tobacco company, cigarette companies have done the research and the most
[52:06.940 --> 52:11.020]  addictive terpene is limonene and that's that lemon flavor. That's the one with the most our
[52:11.020 --> 52:19.100]  bodies desire most and we get easily addicted to. That's why I that they call some dad kids
[52:19.100 --> 52:23.580]  tree basers because we just keep going back for another dad because sometimes you just can't do
[52:23.580 --> 52:30.540]  there's a jar over here. labeled sweeties if you want to smell that fight in the urge to take it.
[52:30.540 --> 52:37.340]  I don't think it's because I'm addicted to the hash but it's just so wonderful. And I've got
[52:37.340 --> 52:41.100]  15 jars in front of me. It gets hard not to fiddle with a little one. Right? I've got a
[52:41.100 --> 52:44.620]  dab sitting on a dabber here. I've been hoping to get you on a rant long enough where I can take it.
[52:44.620 --> 52:51.020]  It's just fun to go on a rant. But that sweeties bro. Something about that sweeties when you hit
[52:51.020 --> 52:55.580]  it, you blow it out and you go probably go for another dab of that. It's not about getting high
[52:55.580 --> 53:00.780]  or anything. It's just the flavor of that. I don't you can't people say well if you want that flavor,
[53:00.780 --> 53:05.420]  just eat that candy. It's different. There's something about like that's why people vape.
[53:05.420 --> 53:09.500]  I kind of get it. I don't totally get it. But I get it because you just want that sweeties
[53:09.500 --> 53:13.580]  coating all over your tongue and you can't get that in a way from eating. It's only
[53:14.460 --> 53:16.940]  maybe vaping and dabbing are the only way that that's going to happen.
[53:17.500 --> 53:21.180]  Yeah, you got to add nicotine to the whole why people vape thing though.
[53:22.700 --> 53:27.340]  Like as someone who's hooked on nicotine that's powerful as fuck. So when I smell those guys
[53:27.340 --> 53:32.700]  blowing fucking blueberry cupcake clouds, how much of that has nicotine in it? I have no idea.
[53:32.700 --> 53:39.180]  Okay, enough so that this is a device to help people quit smoking as a primary sales method.
[53:39.180 --> 53:42.940]  Ah, I didn't realize that all of them had nicotine. I thought some of it was
[53:43.100 --> 53:47.180]  that fully could be the like this is the little kid with the intractable seizure disorder thing
[53:47.180 --> 53:51.980]  that we get with our like, it's a smaller percentage of the consuming population than
[53:51.980 --> 53:57.260]  you might guess from the TV coverage. The guys are trying to blow a ring through a ring and then
[53:57.260 --> 54:00.380]  dance through the middle of it and then blow a dragon through that. Do you think there's
[54:00.380 --> 54:06.540]  nicotine and all of that? Because they'd probably get I don't know. I know that the first and only
[54:07.340 --> 54:16.300]  time I bought vape juice, which you just heard Louis Black's rant on soy juice. I just kind of
[54:16.300 --> 54:22.380]  went through the same thing. But I saw the mouth vomit when I bought vape juice. They had three or
[54:22.380 --> 54:28.060]  four different potencies of nicotine. And my dumb ass was like, give me the big one. Because like
[54:28.060 --> 54:31.500]  the whole point is like I'm trying to quit smoking. I don't want to have to sit there and
[54:32.460 --> 54:37.980]  hit this continuously. Yeah, I want to puff on it three or four to five times go back inside for two
[54:37.980 --> 54:45.820]  hours. And I chose poorly. It was way too fucking much. Oh shit. And the closest I've ever been to
[54:45.820 --> 54:50.860]  ODing on nicotine was twice within that week long period where I was playing with a babe.
[54:50.860 --> 54:54.940]  I think I've heard your story about that. Actually, top of the hill about to vomit.
[54:54.940 --> 55:01.020]  Yeah, I'm driving over this fairly busy hill on a fairly busy street just puffing on this little
[55:01.100 --> 55:05.900]  nicotine vape not thinking about it. And all of a sudden the whole world starts to fucking vibrate.
[55:06.700 --> 55:11.580]  I'm trying not to throw up and I'm sweating like mad and I'm confused because it feels like I'm
[55:11.580 --> 55:16.700]  having an adverse reaction to an intoxicant but I'm not consuming intoxicants. And then you realize
[55:16.700 --> 55:21.260]  yep, just the truck stopped at the light. Like think about it for a second. Oh shit, I'm puffing
[55:21.260 --> 55:25.820]  on this little vaporizer stick wasn't even thinking straight up dabbing nicotine. Yeah, not like
[55:25.820 --> 55:32.300]  dabbing but I mean basically dabbing nicotine cigarette hash. Yeah, that's I'm trying not to
[55:32.300 --> 55:36.060]  burp but I'm gonna burp. Let me just burp here. I'm gonna move the mic. I'm actually surprised
[55:36.060 --> 55:43.260]  more people haven't gotten sick from vape fluid. Because there's a lot of nicotine like in that
[55:43.260 --> 55:47.580]  little bottle. Oh yeah, I'm sure they do. They just just pass out and let it pass or whatever.
[55:48.300 --> 55:52.220]  Nicotine toxicity is fucking lethal. Yeah, oh shit. It kills a couple of people a year. Not
[55:52.220 --> 55:58.300]  many like three or four. But when you're taking those big clouds and yeah, and who knows what
[55:58.300 --> 56:02.700]  where that stuff's from? Like China people or Chinese companies don't care what they're
[56:02.700 --> 56:05.660]  sending to us. They don't give a fuck what they put in stuff they're shipping overseas.
[56:07.980 --> 56:16.380]  A famous comedian told a story about he was in China and he discovered what they use for cooking
[56:16.380 --> 56:21.580]  oil. If you go to the street carts to get your noodle bowl, that cooking oil, they lift up the
[56:21.580 --> 56:26.460]  manhole cover and reach into the sewer and pull out a ladle of sewer juice, sewer water, sewer,
[56:26.460 --> 56:30.780]  whatever's passing by. And they pour that into the little pot. And that's what they use to cook up
[56:30.780 --> 56:36.060]  your noodles in the walk. Oh, yeah, bro. Yeah. So they're doing that to their own people on the
[56:36.060 --> 56:39.500]  street that are watching them do it. Imagine what they're fucking sending to you telling you it's a
[56:39.500 --> 56:44.300]  vape juice or CBD. It's every five years. There's another scandal where they're like this big
[56:44.300 --> 56:48.940]  product. I remember I remember one point it was like lead paint on kids toys toothpaste for a
[56:48.940 --> 56:55.420]  while. Yeah, it's dog toys all the time. Take the time to research what you're buying and get it
[56:55.420 --> 57:00.380]  from a reliable source like it doesn't matter if it's weed or water or cell phones. Yeah. And that's
[57:00.380 --> 57:05.260]  probably why I feel weird when I smoke a blunt is I'm getting that tobacco high. Like I'm not into
[57:05.260 --> 57:08.540]  smoking blunts. Yeah, that's why sometimes you guys when you pass me a blunt, I'll take one good hit
[57:08.540 --> 57:12.940]  off of it and pass it back and I smoked with you were cool that that's why I don't take it again.
[57:12.940 --> 57:16.780]  That tobacco high gets to me I got to smoke like four dabs just to get that to go away.
[57:17.340 --> 57:23.180]  It it's definitely a second drug when you throw it in there and I don't know why so many people
[57:23.180 --> 57:27.660]  pretend like it's not no I I can see you start fidgeting when it's cigarette time. Like I can
[57:27.660 --> 57:32.940]  see your body change and my brain shifts gears and if you don't address it like it's that's a
[57:32.940 --> 57:36.940]  real addiction. That's why I laugh when people like weeds addictive. I'm like, Hey, I'm addicted
[57:36.940 --> 57:41.980]  to a couple of things. We didn't one of them. Yeah, yeah. I'm not saying it's not possible to
[57:41.980 --> 57:46.460]  get addicted to cannabis. I'm saying it's really fucking hard. Yeah. The cigarettes are the devil
[57:46.620 --> 57:52.460]  but there's Yeah, there's several commonly sold products like Mountain Dew nicotine. If you take
[57:52.460 --> 57:59.580]  either of those away from me. I'm a fuck you up in like six hours max. One of us is gonna die or
[57:59.580 --> 58:03.260]  I'm getting out of here and acquiring those two things. And Mike's not a little guy. So get out
[58:03.260 --> 58:10.780]  of his dad. Yeah. International flights get scary. Yeah, I've been teaching the podcast listeners
[58:10.780 --> 58:15.740]  that if you're in law in an interaction that was much harder to say than it should have been if you
[58:15.740 --> 58:21.660]  are in an interaction with law enforcement and you're a large male like us just sit down like
[58:21.660 --> 58:26.140]  because some little cops smaller average size cops will look at us like fuck I hope he doesn't do
[58:26.140 --> 58:30.940]  anything squirrelly and they're gonna act a little skittish. So you're my size your size just sit on
[58:30.940 --> 58:34.620]  the curb and cross your legs and chill out you'll be okay. They're gonna feel more comfortable.
[58:35.900 --> 58:39.740]  All right, I'm gonna move forward with the show. Mike's got a weird look on his face now.
[58:40.140 --> 58:48.220]  Um, so oh, it's 420. Just look right at the phone. It's 424 420. Everybody said that like we're some
[58:48.220 --> 58:54.140]  sort of committee. Happy 420. Everybody. It's episode 350. It's a little bit celebratory. We
[58:54.140 --> 58:58.380]  didn't do much grow talk. We talked about our favorite strains. We rambled quite a bit. We had
[58:58.380 --> 59:03.660]  a good time. I want to read one Facebook comment because this was really cool. And I figured
[59:03.660 --> 59:08.460]  there's a monumental moment. This guy said, Hey, RJ, which is for Rasta Jeff. He said,
[59:08.460 --> 59:13.420]  Greetings from the UK. What's up over the pond, bro? Good to know that people listening over there.
[59:14.140 --> 59:19.180]  Hope you're doing well. Just a quick one to say thanks for all the time and effort you put into
[59:19.180 --> 59:25.900]  the podcast entirely pro gratis. I like that. Yes, it is my gift to you because I love you and I love
[59:25.900 --> 59:30.220]  cannabis and I want you to grow the best cannabis you can so that you can take the best care of
[59:30.220 --> 59:33.020]  yourself and not have to give your money to somebody that doesn't care about you. I'm going
[59:33.020 --> 59:36.940]  to continue with the message. It says I look forward to each show or to each new show and I'm
[59:36.940 --> 59:42.940]  always rewarded with plain sensible advice that follows Einstein's idiom. If you can't explain it,
[59:42.940 --> 59:48.460]  sorry, I'm going to back up. If you can't explain it simply, then you do not understand the subject
[59:48.460 --> 59:54.940]  well enough for the new generation of growers. You and a couple of notable others will be there.
[59:54.940 --> 01:00:01.180]  Ed Rosenthal or Jorge Cervantes. Keep up the good work. Have a fatty dab for me and give your mom
[01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:06.060]  a hug. Best wishes. Then he signed it with his name. I'll keep him anonymous. Dude, this guy
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:16.140]  just said, I'm the next I'm one of the next ads or Jorge's. I've never thought of the show in those
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:22.780]  terms. But I don't disagree at all. I don't know that I realized that but that is Yeah, they are
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:29.420]  people are the generation. Fuck my generation, the generation after me, my daughter's generation.
[01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:34.380]  They want their information now. If it's in a book. They'll never find it. If it's on the internet,
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:38.940]  there's a good chance they'll find it. If it's delivered audio while they're driving, they might
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:43.980]  might get it. There's there's a much more opportune chance of them finding that info. So
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:48.700]  podcasting is going to be one of the major learning sources. YouTube is going to be one of the major
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:54.140]  learning sources. So I do agree with that. And thank you. That's really cool. I hope I hope that
[01:00:54.140 --> 01:01:00.700]  doesn't make me nervous. But I do appreciate that. That's a really cool compliment. I never I don't
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:05.260]  think I thought about that that we are a little extra weight for the upcoming groceries. The torch
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:10.140]  has been passed there. Yes, that means a lot to me. The torch is deaf. I remember seeing Ed maybe
[01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:15.740]  in the fuck this was like a decade ago. And you could tell that every question he was asked for
[01:01:15.740 --> 01:01:22.700]  the entire hour he was answering panel questions. He was like, fuck again. Yeah, the answer is seven.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:29.020]  I do this every year. Next question. Did you not hear me last year? The answer is for just she was
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:34.460]  just so burnt. Yeah. Well, I will need somebody with passion to get people interested in learning.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.140]  Yeah, I've got some passion and some energy and fish the fish weekend. I've been talking about
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.140]  a lot the fish weekend really refreshed me feel recharged. Yeah, I got some I got some recharge,
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:48.300]  bro. Recharge. Recharge. I like it. Mike, you're funny. That recharge. growing tall and growing
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:52.860]  fresh. My roots are strong. But this email just meant a lot of this message. It's came from
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:56.060]  Facebook. So this meant a lot to me. Thanks, dude. And it's cool to know that I've got people
[01:01:56.060 --> 01:02:01.420]  listening in the UK. Because I see a lot of really crazy cannabis news coming out of the UK.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.860]  So I'm glad good cannabis information is also making its way. Yes. Yes. Let me know where
[01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.060]  you're listening. You guys send me a tweet or send me an email. You can Twitter me. It's at
[01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:14.060]  GFYH podcast. I'd like to know where you're listening from. Or you can send me an email.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:18.860]  It's at a girl from your heart at hotmail.com. Just tell me where you are. I'm curious. That's
[01:02:18.940 --> 01:02:30.050]  got my my curiosity sparked now. Dude, Episode 350. I'm shocked. I'm blown away. It's been fun.
[01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:37.490]  350 episodes, and I've got at least 25 or 50 more planned. And I'm talking about Episode 420. So
[01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:42.210]  we're gonna sign a plow through 400. No problem. Yeah, yeah. I'm gonna plow right through it.
[01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:46.770]  Shooting for 1000. I'm gonna keep it free, guys. I'm gonna keep it free. We're not gonna do any of
[01:02:46.770 --> 01:02:51.330]  that pay for stuff sort of thing. People are getting obnoxious that shit lately. I'm not even
[01:02:51.330 --> 01:02:57.010]  gonna say names or point fingers. But yeah, there's a lot of Yeah, that Mike comes over and
[01:02:57.010 --> 01:03:01.650]  hangs out and does this show. He gets dabbed out. He gets to hang out. There's no funding for Mike
[01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:07.650]  in this. I apologize for that, Mike. No, it's it's I know it would be really fucking cool if
[01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:13.650]  we both got a paycheck for doing this. But that's not why either of us do it. No, I do get some
[01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:19.890]  patreon contributions. It's a generous amount of funding every month. It's not like fucking
[01:03:19.890 --> 01:03:24.850]  paycheck style, but it is it's great that covers it makes it easy to computer and the internet.
[01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:29.650]  Honestly, it covers the car this computer was purchased on a Best Buy card. So I appreciate
[01:03:29.650 --> 01:03:33.810]  it. This mic does not smell like someone's foot. Yes. And I buy these little mic covers and I buy
[01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:38.850]  these bottles of water. But the payment goes this computer payment is covered with that and the Wi
[01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:43.810]  Fi and the cable internet here is super expensive. So it covers that stuff. So that is definitely
[01:03:43.810 --> 01:03:48.530]  noticed that keeps the podcast doesn't cost me anything to produce. So it's going to be free for
[01:03:48.530 --> 01:03:53.090]  you. And as long as I can keep it free until they do some weird shit to the internet where I have
[01:03:53.090 --> 01:03:58.050]  to pay to podcast or something, it's going to be free. That's that's what I'm wanting to do. I want
[01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:03.650]  I'm here to make cannabis better not get rich off of cannabis. I want you guys to grow the best herb
[01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:08.290]  you can grow so that you can medicate yourself or your loved ones the best that they could be
[01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:12.530]  medicated so they can find what they need. And you don't have to spend your money with either
[01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:17.730]  a dispensary a pharmaceutical company, or depending on where you are the black market,
[01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:25.010]  try to keep you guys taken care of safely. The original goal of just help more people
[01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:30.930]  be better informed. Yeah, that's why we're here. Yep. Yep. Just doing it because I've kind of been
[01:04:30.930 --> 01:04:35.090]  money'd be nice. But as long as we're meeting that first goal, I'm super happy. I've been
[01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:41.650]  blessed to do this long enough to have a great understanding of the plant. I was I was doing it
[01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:48.370]  before we should admit doing it. And thanks to jar whoever you believe in I'm knocking on wood,
[01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:53.010]  I'm clapping my hands, throwing salt over my shoulders, crossing my fingers to your hard work
[01:04:53.010 --> 01:04:59.410]  and dedication to a couple of simple rules. But there were Yeah, I nothing horribly wrong ever
[01:04:59.410 --> 01:05:05.570]  happened in those times of prohibition when I was doing this sort of thing. And I did quite well
[01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:11.730]  during prohibition times. That's a to be but when prohibition was here, things were different.
[01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:15.730]  We were never hungry. I'm not hungry now. But we were fucking spoiled when prohibition was here.
[01:05:16.530 --> 01:05:20.610]  And they never got myself in trouble. I always I always took care of other people. And those
[01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:25.090]  times too. If you came by and you just didn't have any funds, it gets you as high as I could
[01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:29.010]  possibly fucking get you. And that's always like, here's a drink. Yeah, there's a bowl
[01:05:29.010 --> 01:05:32.690]  sit on my couch, play some video games. It's always been me and get you stone and feed you.
[01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:36.930]  That's how we've always been. So I feel like since I didn't get in trouble back in the day,
[01:05:36.930 --> 01:05:41.010]  and I've been blessed enough to be in something that I just love, like cannabis is awesome to me,
[01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:45.410]  this is I wake up thinking about it. I'm like, what are we going to grow today? So doing this,
[01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:49.890]  I feel like this is my give back for not getting in trouble. And this is my give back for kind of
[01:05:49.890 --> 01:05:54.130]  being allowed to do what I love to do. If you love what you do, you don't work a day in your life. So
[01:05:54.130 --> 01:05:58.930]  come in here and do a podcast. Sometimes there are some evenings when I try to say the word
[01:05:58.930 --> 01:06:04.370]  cannabis and I say cannabis fucking 17 times in a row. And I want to throw the microphone through
[01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:07.970]  the fucking computer screen. But by the end of the night, when I'm done recording, it all feels
[01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:13.090]  great. You got me to say I like to grateful dead earlier. Yeah, yeah. It happens when you talk a
[01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:17.650]  lot. Your tongue goes weird. Sometimes I've learned to accept it. There's been times when
[01:06:18.530 --> 01:06:23.970]  people have wanted me to do things I've had to miss shows and parties and social interactions.
[01:06:23.970 --> 01:06:28.530]  I've had to minimize social interaction time sometimes because we're trying to do the podcast
[01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:35.730]  and I'm okay with that. It is it's well worth it. It's well worth it. We put in about three hours
[01:06:35.730 --> 01:06:42.210]  from like when I show up to when I leave to put together like a 45 minute hour and 10 minute show.
[01:06:42.210 --> 01:06:47.090]  It's different when you're not here. But no, it goes much smoother when you're solo. But like,
[01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:53.010]  that's not worked for me. It doesn't feel like I put in three hours at a job, right? Like no,
[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:57.650]  it's it's very different when you really enjoy what you do. And I feel privileged to be able to
[01:06:57.650 --> 01:07:04.450]  do it. And you guys appreciate all the listeners said in feedback and not hate mail. When you guys
[01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:09.410]  see these upcoming episodes, when you hear them, you'll say, Oh, man, he stayed up late. Because
[01:07:09.410 --> 01:07:16.370]  some of these are quite lengthy. I'm trying to pull one up here. Mike can see how several pages
[01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:20.850]  Yeah, that that one's a shorty too. But yeah, there. This is the next episode right there.
[01:07:20.850 --> 01:07:24.690]  We've got one, two, just two pages, but lots of notes on that one. Lots of little
[01:07:25.410 --> 01:07:28.770]  bullet points and stuff. So yeah, I'm putting a lot of work into you guys. We're gonna do a lot
[01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.890]  of good stuff coming up in the future. I don't even know where we got off on this rant. But
[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:34.770]  thank you guys for listening. I'm gonna keep the podcast for free. That's my point. There is a
