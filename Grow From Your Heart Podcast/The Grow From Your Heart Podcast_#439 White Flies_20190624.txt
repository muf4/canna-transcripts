[00:06.680 --> 00:10.300]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:10.300 --> 00:14.720]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:14.720 --> 00:20.680]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:20.680 --> 00:23.840]  You know, it has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what
[00:23.840 --> 00:24.840]  I'm smoking.
[00:24.840 --> 00:30.400]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:30.400 --> 00:38.680]  The label says this product contains 64.7% THC and 76.4% total cannabinoids.
[00:38.680 --> 00:40.860]  Stardog is one of my favorite strains to smoke.
[00:40.860 --> 00:44.680]  It is also one of my favorite strains to grow, and I absolutely love the concentrate.
[00:44.680 --> 00:49.160]  So big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the Stardog Ambrosia.
[00:49.160 --> 00:53.680]  All right, Podcast World, in this episode, I'm going to read a listener email about white
[00:53.680 --> 00:54.720]  flies.
[00:54.720 --> 00:57.760]  Before we get there, let's give some shout outs to our friends on Patreon.
[00:57.760 --> 01:02.360]  I want to give a giant Grow From Your Heart Podcast shout out to my friend Jacob W. I
[01:02.360 --> 01:04.080]  owe a giant shout out to JustBazz.

[01:24.520 --> 01:27.320]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:27.320 --> 01:31.080]  All right, in this episode, I am going to read an email about white flies.
[01:31.080 --> 01:35.680]  Before we get there, I would like to talk about something I saw in the news recently.
[01:35.680 --> 01:40.560]  Recently I saw a report of a young lady dying from cannabis use.
[01:40.560 --> 01:43.900]  I want to come on this podcast and call complete bullshit.
[01:43.900 --> 01:47.500]  That young lady did not die because of cannabis use.
[01:47.500 --> 01:50.140]  I do not know that lady's medical history.
[01:50.140 --> 01:52.020]  I don't know anything about that person.
[01:52.020 --> 01:58.260]  The only thing I know is that this person died and the coroner found THC in her system.
[01:58.260 --> 02:02.060]  So he then decided that cannabis is what killed this lady.
[02:02.060 --> 02:03.980]  I call complete bullshit.
[02:03.980 --> 02:07.900]  I think that this medical examiner is blaming cannabis because he can't find the true cause
[02:07.900 --> 02:08.900]  of death.
[02:08.900 --> 02:13.020]  And I also think he may be blaming cannabis so that he can catch a little spotlight time
[02:13.140 --> 02:14.140]  for a minute.
[02:14.140 --> 02:18.820]  If he finds the very first cannabis-related death, that will put him in some sort of medical
[02:18.820 --> 02:19.820]  book.
[02:19.820 --> 02:20.820]  That will put some news on him.
[02:20.820 --> 02:23.620]  I'm talking about the doctor right now, even though I won't say his name.
[02:23.620 --> 02:27.220]  He is getting a little bit of spotlight time because of this situation.
[02:27.220 --> 02:30.740]  He may be taking that opportunity to get a little attention.
[02:30.740 --> 02:32.540]  And he may be on the other team.
[02:32.540 --> 02:34.380]  He may be against cannabis.
[02:34.380 --> 02:38.940]  So this would be a good way to kind of throw cannabis under the bus is to find the very
[02:38.940 --> 02:41.860]  first death caused by cannabis.
[02:41.860 --> 02:43.740]  So he would be able to fight for the other team.
[02:43.740 --> 02:48.580]  He'd be able to get a little bit of notoriety, and he would also have a cause and explanation
[02:48.580 --> 02:50.460]  for this young lady's death.
[02:50.460 --> 02:54.580]  From everything else I read, there is not a reasonable cause of death.
[02:54.580 --> 02:58.860]  So he simply states that he believes cannabis is what did it.
[02:58.860 --> 02:59.860]  I am not a doctor.
[02:59.860 --> 03:03.560]  I'm not going to try to explain why you cannot OD from cannabis.
[03:03.560 --> 03:08.180]  It does not work on the parts of your body that make you shut down and make you die.
[03:08.180 --> 03:09.580]  Those are different drugs.
[03:09.580 --> 03:13.580]  If you could die from cannabis, it would have happened a long time ago.
[03:13.580 --> 03:18.740]  Myself and many of my friends would have been victims several years ago.
[03:18.740 --> 03:22.220]  I do not know anything about this young lady's medical history.
[03:22.220 --> 03:24.060]  I don't know anything about her health history.
[03:24.060 --> 03:26.760]  I don't know anything about her life or her habits.
[03:26.760 --> 03:28.380]  She was not an old person.
[03:28.380 --> 03:29.980]  She was not a sick person.
[03:29.980 --> 03:33.300]  That is really all that any of the articles listed would mention about her.
[03:33.300 --> 03:38.160]  The only real details we got was that she was dead and that she had THC in her system
[03:38.200 --> 03:41.400]  and that the coroner was blaming it on the THC.
[03:41.400 --> 03:47.440]  I know it's tragic and terrible when anybody dies, but sometimes people just die without explanation.
[03:47.440 --> 03:49.640]  There doesn't have to be a reason.
[03:49.640 --> 03:52.520]  Sometimes part of your body just goes, hey, I'm done.
[03:52.520 --> 03:53.780]  Sometimes your car breaks down.
[03:53.780 --> 03:55.060]  Sometimes your computer gives up.
[03:55.060 --> 03:56.560]  Sometimes a light bulb burns out.
[03:56.560 --> 04:00.200]  Our bodies are made of a bunch of different connecting parts and when one decides to shut
[04:00.200 --> 04:02.560]  down, it can shut down the whole system.
[04:02.560 --> 04:05.800]  So I don't know what killed this young lady.
[04:06.040 --> 04:10.280]  Honestly, I don't believe the coroner knows what killed this young lady.
[04:10.280 --> 04:16.720]  One thing I am certain of, this lady did not die because she had THC in her system.
[04:16.720 --> 04:21.240]  So no matter what the news tells you, no matter what this report tells you, there are still
[04:21.240 --> 04:25.340]  zero deaths linked to cannabis consumption.
[04:25.340 --> 04:28.440]  I want to send my love and my condolences to this young lady's family.
[04:28.440 --> 04:31.880]  It's terrible that she's been brought into the news and into the spotlight in such a
[04:31.880 --> 04:33.600]  terrible way, but I send my love.
[04:33.600 --> 04:35.680]  I send my heart out to her, her family.
[04:36.080 --> 04:38.760]  I send a big middle finger to this coroner.
[04:38.760 --> 04:39.760]  He is wrong.
[04:39.760 --> 04:40.760]  He is a liar.
[04:40.760 --> 04:42.440]  I really think he's just trying to get some spotlight.
[04:42.440 --> 04:45.160]  I am not sure if this is the end of this story.
[04:45.160 --> 04:49.240]  I'm not sure if he can just say cannabis caused this and then somewhere in some record book,
[04:49.240 --> 04:52.120]  it now says that there is an official cannabis death.
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.240]  I hope that there is more investigation, more to be proven before that can be marked down.
[04:56.240 --> 04:59.280]  I will do my best to stay updated on that situation.
[04:59.280 --> 05:03.000]  All right, let's jump into this email about white flies.
[05:03.000 --> 05:05.040]  This email goes a lot like this.
[05:05.200 --> 05:06.280]  Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[05:06.280 --> 05:11.000]  I need some help and you are the best resource I know for all things cannabis.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.200]  Feel free to read this on the show if you want.
[05:13.200 --> 05:14.200]  Well, here we go, buddy.
[05:14.200 --> 05:16.120]  We're going to read this on the show right now.
[05:16.120 --> 05:19.240]  It says, I've been bested by white flies.
[05:19.240 --> 05:22.000]  Let me give you a little background on my grow.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.520]  I grow in a reasonably sized cabinet, six foot by two foot divided into two by two and
[05:28.520 --> 05:31.640]  four by two spaces and a two by two grow tent.
[05:31.640 --> 05:35.000]  I keep my mothers in the two by two cabinet.
[05:35.000 --> 05:41.360]  I grow out clones in the two by two, flower in the four by two, all in soil with LED lighting.
[05:41.360 --> 05:42.960]  All of this is in my basement.
[05:42.960 --> 05:46.920]  All right, so we've got a nice little compact perpetual grow.
[05:46.920 --> 05:52.080]  It says about two or two and a half months ago, I found white flies in my flower.
[05:52.080 --> 05:56.920]  I picked off every affected leaf and put out a bunch of sticky traps here on the right
[05:56.920 --> 05:57.920]  start.
[05:57.920 --> 06:02.160]  I shook the plants three to four times a day and vacuumed up what flew off, which got me
[06:02.160 --> 06:04.000]  through flower.
[06:04.000 --> 06:06.680]  So far, that is an effective strategy.
[06:06.680 --> 06:08.960]  Let's talk about white flies really quickly.
[06:08.960 --> 06:11.600]  White flies are really easy to identify.
[06:11.600 --> 06:13.600]  They are little white flies.
[06:13.600 --> 06:16.300]  They look like flying pieces of ash in your grow room.
[06:16.300 --> 06:20.520]  If you pull off a leaf and turn it upside down, it looks like a piece of rice or probably
[06:20.520 --> 06:24.040]  bunches of pieces of rice on the bottom of your leaves.
[06:24.040 --> 06:25.440]  Those are white flies.
[06:25.440 --> 06:29.520]  When you shake the plants, when you tap the pots, if white things come flying out, those
[06:29.520 --> 06:30.520]  are white flies.
[06:31.080 --> 06:35.000]  This guy said he shook the plants three to four times a day and vacuumed up what flew
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  off.
[06:36.000 --> 06:37.800]  That is a very effective strategy.
[06:37.800 --> 06:40.160]  Those white flies want to fly up toward the light.
[06:40.160 --> 06:41.760]  When you shake the plant, you disrupt them.
[06:41.760 --> 06:42.760]  They're nice and comfortable.
[06:42.760 --> 06:43.880]  They're hanging out in the leaves.
[06:43.880 --> 06:45.760]  You shake it, they go, oh, what the fuck was that?
[06:45.760 --> 06:47.280]  They go flying up toward the light.
[06:47.280 --> 06:51.640]  They just want to go fly until all the disruption stops and they'll go land back on their home.
[06:51.640 --> 06:55.840]  While they're flying, get the shop vac and just shop vac the shit out of them.
[06:55.840 --> 06:59.880]  I use the long attachment on the shop vac and I would just point that right at the
[06:59.880 --> 07:04.680]  light and just move back and forth as those bugs fly up at the light and just get them.
[07:04.680 --> 07:08.640]  If you want to get in there and tap the buds with the shop vac and just smack it, you're
[07:08.640 --> 07:10.320]  using that long wand attachment.
[07:10.320 --> 07:13.640]  Just smack some of the buds with that and then the bugs will go flying out.
[07:13.640 --> 07:16.060]  You can just suck them up right as they come flying out there.
[07:16.060 --> 07:18.000]  You can do that multiple times a day.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.040]  If you remove a lot of the excess foliage, the white flies have less places to hang out,
[07:23.040 --> 07:26.240]  less places for breeding, make it less desirable in there.
[07:26.240 --> 07:27.760]  There is more to this email.
[07:27.760 --> 07:28.760]  Let's keep going.
[07:28.760 --> 07:33.720]  It says, now with everything in veg, I went to the growth store and got the recommendations
[07:33.720 --> 07:38.400]  of my local guy and treated with a rosemary extract pesticide.
[07:38.400 --> 07:44.320]  I also did a soil soak and foliar spray on all three spaces and I sprayed down all surfaces
[07:44.320 --> 07:45.320]  as well.
[07:45.320 --> 07:50.540]  All right, so you got a pesticide that was recommended by a growth store person.
[07:50.540 --> 07:54.740]  Then you did a soil soak and a foliar spray on all of your spaces, so you treated all
[07:54.740 --> 07:56.620]  of the plants that were in veg.
[07:56.620 --> 07:59.880]  Then you also sprayed down all surfaces.
[07:59.880 --> 08:01.200]  That is a good plan of attack.
[08:01.200 --> 08:06.540]  That is a good strategy, but I honestly don't think that the rosemary extract pesticide
[08:06.540 --> 08:11.500]  is going to be strong enough to eradicate white flies at the level which you have got
[08:11.500 --> 08:12.500]  them.
[08:12.500 --> 08:18.060]  You have got a serious infestation and something like a rosemary extract works better as a
[08:18.060 --> 08:19.060]  preventative.
[08:19.060 --> 08:22.620]  It makes it kind of undesirable for the pests and they're already there.
[08:22.620 --> 08:23.620]  They don't give a shit.
[08:23.620 --> 08:25.360]  They've made themselves comfortable.
[08:25.360 --> 08:29.580]  I don't think you're going to get enough coverage with this rosemary extract to run them off.
[08:29.580 --> 08:30.620]  There's more to the message.
[08:30.620 --> 08:31.620]  Let's keep going.
[08:31.620 --> 08:33.180]  It says, it seemed to work.
[08:33.180 --> 08:37.700]  He recommended holding off on moving anything into flower and treat a few times a week for
[08:37.700 --> 08:41.920]  a few weeks to make sure the white flies are gone.
[08:41.920 --> 08:43.740]  Everything seemed to be going well.
[08:43.740 --> 08:45.540]  I treated for three weeks.
[08:45.540 --> 08:46.780]  I cut new clones.
[08:46.780 --> 08:53.540]  I moved my current clones to flower and after a week under 1212, I found more white flies.
[08:53.540 --> 08:55.180]  Something to address right there.
[08:55.180 --> 09:00.300]  First off, you started with a pesticide application that was not strong enough for the infestation
[09:00.300 --> 09:01.560]  you were battling.
[09:01.560 --> 09:03.220]  So you did not really have a chance.
[09:03.220 --> 09:05.860]  It looks like you knocked them down, but there were still eggs.
[09:05.860 --> 09:08.580]  You need to break the life cycle of the pest.
[09:08.580 --> 09:11.340]  You need to disrupt multiple generations.
[09:11.340 --> 09:14.580]  Then you can guarantee that the pests are gone, but you were using something that didn't
[09:14.580 --> 09:16.520]  knock out all stages.
[09:16.520 --> 09:18.760]  Then you made a crucial mistake.
[09:18.760 --> 09:24.400]  You applied the same pesticide multiple times a week for multiple weeks.
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.600]  By the third week, those white flies were laughing at that pesticide.
[09:28.600 --> 09:31.640]  They were going, ha ha, we drink that shit now.
[09:31.640 --> 09:37.900]  The bugs that are now in your room have built up a resistance to that rosemary extract pesticide.
[09:37.900 --> 09:41.940]  So your main crucial mistake was using one pesticide over and over again.
[09:41.940 --> 09:43.540]  You need to rotate products.
[09:43.540 --> 09:48.060]  You need multiple different products so that you can prevent that resistance.
[09:48.060 --> 09:50.220]  You also need the appropriate pesticide.
[09:50.220 --> 09:53.820]  You were basically just giving them a bubble bath after a while, and they were just laughing
[09:53.820 --> 09:54.820]  at you.
[09:54.820 --> 09:55.820]  Let's keep going.
[09:55.820 --> 09:56.820]  There is more to this message.
[09:56.820 --> 09:58.340]  At this point, the plants are in flower.
[09:58.340 --> 10:03.500]  They're under 12-12, and we have discovered more white flies one week into flower.
[10:03.500 --> 10:05.620]  So it says they are in all three spaces.
[10:05.620 --> 10:08.220]  Yes, those white flies get around quite quickly.
[10:08.220 --> 10:10.060]  They breed rapidly.
[10:10.060 --> 10:11.300]  White flies are a pain in the ass.
[10:11.300 --> 10:12.860]  They get out of control really quickly.
[10:12.940 --> 10:14.940]  But we are going to help you get rid of them.
[10:14.940 --> 10:19.700]  He says, I trashed all of my clones and flowering plants.
[10:19.700 --> 10:21.140]  I trimmed up my mother plants.
[10:21.140 --> 10:26.980]  I vacuumed the spaces out, and I tried insecticidal soap on the mothers and empty grow spaces.
[10:26.980 --> 10:28.660]  Again, it seemed to help.
[10:28.660 --> 10:29.820]  I thought they were gone.
[10:29.820 --> 10:33.380]  I cut new clones, and this week, they're back again.
[10:33.380 --> 10:37.620]  Yeah, that insecticidal soap and that rosemary oil are not going to cut it.
[10:37.620 --> 10:39.100]  We're going to have to step up our game.
[10:39.100 --> 10:40.740]  We're going to have to go nuclear pretty soon.
[10:40.740 --> 10:42.020]  We're going to have to talk about that.
[10:42.060 --> 10:43.060]  Let's keep going.
[10:43.060 --> 10:44.060]  There is more to this message.
[10:44.060 --> 10:47.020]  I grabbed a bag of diatenaceous earth, and I've dusted everything.
[10:47.020 --> 10:53.260]  I checked today, and the bottoms of my leaves are loaded with white fly larva once again.
[10:53.260 --> 10:55.340]  I need a nuclear solution to this.
[10:55.340 --> 11:00.100]  I'm not sure what else to try other than bug bombs in each grow space, and I hope the mothers
[11:00.100 --> 11:02.700]  survive to cut clones from.
[11:02.700 --> 11:08.620]  Can you recommend anything that would be a surefire way to wipe out my white flies?
[11:08.620 --> 11:10.780]  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
[11:10.820 --> 11:12.820]  Thanks again from Dan.
[11:12.820 --> 11:14.820]  Hey, Dan, thank you for the great email.
[11:14.820 --> 11:19.500]  It's too bad you got white flies, but let's talk about getting rid of those bad motherfuckers
[11:19.500 --> 11:20.540]  for you.
[11:20.540 --> 11:21.980]  White flies can be a pain in the ass.
[11:21.980 --> 11:24.300]  Like I said earlier, they come on quickly.
[11:24.300 --> 11:25.660]  They breed quickly.
[11:25.660 --> 11:27.860]  They spread from room to room rapidly.
[11:27.860 --> 11:31.460]  Unless you know how to get rid of them, they can be a complete pain in the ass.
[11:31.460 --> 11:35.700]  Let's talk about eradicating white flies in your grow.
[11:35.700 --> 11:38.500]  One thing that I like is you only have mother plants.
[11:38.500 --> 11:39.940]  That is going to be very beneficial.
[11:39.980 --> 11:42.700]  You don't have to think about treating plants that are in flower.
[11:42.700 --> 11:46.860]  We will talk about treating flowering plants, but it's going to help you out a lot that
[11:46.860 --> 11:50.780]  you can apply just about anything at this point because you have got veg plants.
[11:50.780 --> 11:52.540]  You don't have any buds to worry about.
[11:52.540 --> 11:54.540]  That is truly advantageous.
[11:54.540 --> 11:58.420]  I think a lot of growers, a lot of facilities are doing it a little bit backwards when it
[11:58.420 --> 12:00.060]  comes to pest management.
[12:00.060 --> 12:03.340]  They focus on treating the flowering plants for pests.
[12:03.340 --> 12:05.660]  They're the priority for pest management.
[12:05.660 --> 12:09.260]  Then they go to the large veg, then they go to the small veg, then they go to the tiny
[12:09.300 --> 12:12.820]  stuff, then they go to the moms and they worry about the moms dead last when it comes to
[12:12.820 --> 12:13.980]  pest management.
[12:13.980 --> 12:16.540]  I like to go the complete opposite direction.
[12:16.540 --> 12:22.140]  I like to worry about pest, pathogen, problem-free mother plants and work my way forward through
[12:22.140 --> 12:24.620]  the grow with a good healthy start.
[12:24.620 --> 12:29.500]  In my opinion, IPM starts in the mother room, then it works all the way through the grow.
[12:29.500 --> 12:30.500]  It's a process.
[12:30.500 --> 12:33.580]  It starts in the mother room just like all of the other plants.
[12:33.580 --> 12:37.000]  I love that you've got nothing but mother plants to work with.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.940]  That puts you ahead of the game.
[12:38.980 --> 12:42.580]  One of the first things I would do is work on sealing up my grow space.
[12:42.580 --> 12:44.180]  Where are those bugs coming in?
[12:44.180 --> 12:47.140]  They're tiny, but they're finding a way in and they're breeding.
[12:47.140 --> 12:48.880]  Figure out where they're coming from.
[12:48.880 --> 12:51.340]  Seal up the grow space a little bit more securely.
[12:51.340 --> 12:52.780]  That will help you out.
[12:52.780 --> 12:56.300]  The next step is to defoliate heavily.
[12:56.300 --> 12:58.740]  Take off any leaf you don't think you need.
[12:58.740 --> 13:02.260]  We need to get rid of all of the breeding space, all the hangout spots.
[13:02.260 --> 13:06.340]  We need to remove all the space for these fucking whiteflies to hang out.
[13:06.340 --> 13:08.420]  Let's take away all the free parking.
[13:08.420 --> 13:09.660]  Chop it out of there.
[13:09.660 --> 13:10.660]  Clean it up.
[13:10.660 --> 13:12.220]  Get that out of the grow space.
[13:12.220 --> 13:13.620]  Get that out of the house.
[13:13.620 --> 13:15.160]  You said this is in your basement.
[13:15.160 --> 13:16.400]  Get it out of the house.
[13:16.400 --> 13:18.960]  Get it as far away from your house as you can.
[13:18.960 --> 13:20.540]  Get rid of all these whiteflies.
[13:20.540 --> 13:21.660]  Just evict them.
[13:21.660 --> 13:22.660]  Get out.
[13:22.660 --> 13:23.660]  We don't want them here.
[13:23.660 --> 13:25.380]  So defoliate heavily.
[13:25.380 --> 13:27.860]  Defoliate to the point that you're worried about those plants.
[13:27.860 --> 13:28.860]  They'll grow more leaves.
[13:28.860 --> 13:29.860]  They'll come back.
[13:29.860 --> 13:33.520]  As long as those plants are mostly healthy, they will recover from the defoliation.
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.260]  They will like being defoliated more than they like being a host for whiteflies.
[13:38.260 --> 13:40.300]  So strip off any extra leaves.
[13:40.300 --> 13:42.000]  Strip off all the giant fan leaves.
[13:42.000 --> 13:43.820]  We don't need all that shit right now.
[13:43.820 --> 13:45.560]  These aren't high performance plants.
[13:45.560 --> 13:49.460]  These are mother plants that we're just trying to make survive at this point in time.
[13:49.460 --> 13:51.180]  So defoliate heavily.
[13:51.180 --> 13:54.900]  Your next thing to think about is stepping up your spray regimen.
[13:54.900 --> 13:59.260]  The things you're spraying right now have basically become Kool-Aid for the whiteflies.
[13:59.260 --> 14:02.820]  I would suggest a stronger pesticide application.
[14:02.820 --> 14:05.460]  Here is where you have a few moral decisions to make.
[14:05.460 --> 14:08.140]  How strong of a pesticide do you want to use?
[14:08.180 --> 14:14.620]  I try to stay on the Colorado Department of Agriculture approved pesticide list for commercial
[14:14.620 --> 14:16.100]  cannabis production.
[14:16.100 --> 14:20.980]  I try to maintain that standard in any grow I work in, whether it be a home grow, whether
[14:20.980 --> 14:22.060]  it be a commercial grow.
[14:22.060 --> 14:25.900]  I still try to adhere to those standards just to make it a habit.
[14:25.900 --> 14:30.460]  Some people don't want to use any pesticides that are not OMRI certified organic.
[14:30.460 --> 14:34.780]  What you spray on your plants is ultimately your decision, but also you have to live with
[14:34.780 --> 14:38.860]  what you've done to those plants and what you are giving to other people to consume.
[14:38.860 --> 14:42.780]  So as long as you can live with yourself and you feel okay with what you've done, you can
[14:42.780 --> 14:45.580]  apply whatever you're comfortable with to these plants.
[14:45.580 --> 14:49.140]  In this message, you said you're ready to go nuclear.
[14:49.140 --> 14:56.540]  Carefully scheduled, sprayed pesticide applications will be the quickest and simplest way to eradicate
[14:56.540 --> 14:59.740]  these bugs, but we can't just keep spraying forever.
[14:59.740 --> 15:03.700]  So we need to eradicate them and figure out how they got in there and make sure they don't
[15:03.700 --> 15:05.220]  come back.
[15:05.220 --> 15:09.540]  So let's talk about a few products we can apply to our plants to make sure we get rid
[15:09.540 --> 15:11.180]  of these white flies.
[15:11.180 --> 15:13.980]  One thing we can start with is Azomax.
[15:13.980 --> 15:19.580]  Azomax has multiple modes of attack to make sure these bugs don't want to be around.
[15:19.580 --> 15:22.900]  Hopefully when you're working with Azomax, you're wearing a glove, but if you've ever
[15:22.900 --> 15:25.960]  touched it, you'll notice that it is quite oily.
[15:25.960 --> 15:29.240]  We apply that oily consistency to the bottom of the leaves.
[15:29.240 --> 15:33.380]  The bugs don't want to be on that oily consistency, so it makes it undesirable for them to live
[15:34.060 --> 15:35.060]  there.
[15:35.060 --> 15:39.300]  Then as an added bonus, there is azadirachtin in the Azomax that works as a stomach poison.
[15:39.300 --> 15:43.420]  So any pest that does eat your leafy foliage, they will get a tummy ache, they will stop
[15:43.420 --> 15:45.400]  eating and they will die.
[15:45.400 --> 15:48.840]  Another product I can recommend for you is Evergreen Pyrethrum.
[15:48.840 --> 15:51.820]  There's also a very similar product called Pyganic.
[15:51.820 --> 15:55.580]  They're very similar products, but they do have different application rates.
[15:55.580 --> 15:59.040]  So if you were used to using one or the other, make sure you read the bottle and adjust your
[15:59.040 --> 16:00.860]  application rates.
[16:00.860 --> 16:03.700]  Both of those products are very oily and very sticky.
[16:03.700 --> 16:07.080]  So again, we're going to apply those to the bottom, the underside of the leaves where
[16:07.080 --> 16:08.760]  we see all those eggs.
[16:08.760 --> 16:12.220]  If we apply a nice coat of oily surface, those bugs don't want to go there.
[16:12.220 --> 16:13.300]  They don't want to hang out.
[16:13.300 --> 16:18.280]  They don't want to breed and will also suffocate the bugs and we can also suffocate their eggs.
[16:18.280 --> 16:23.320]  So if we use Evergreen or Pyganic, our first mode of attack is to create an undesirable
[16:23.320 --> 16:25.300]  environment by making it sticky.
[16:25.300 --> 16:27.020]  We're also suffocating them.
[16:27.020 --> 16:30.220]  Then there's also the added bonus of the Pyrethrum in there.
[16:30.240 --> 16:33.660]  So anything that does take a bite out of the leaf, it is going to get a tummy ache and
[16:33.660 --> 16:35.420]  it is going to die.
[16:35.420 --> 16:37.840]  Those are both very affordable products.
[16:37.840 --> 16:42.820]  Another very affordable and readily available product is something called Monterey Garden
[16:42.820 --> 16:45.340]  Spray with Spinosad.
[16:45.340 --> 16:48.140]  I'm not sure if you call it Spinosad or Spinosad.
[16:48.140 --> 16:51.380]  Either way, that shit works to get rid of white flies.
[16:51.380 --> 16:56.100]  Spinosad is a fungus that is created in the bottom of whiskey or rum barrels.
[16:56.100 --> 16:58.500]  I believe it is the bottom of a whiskey barrel.
[16:58.500 --> 17:03.540]  It is naturally occurring and for some reason it kills the shit out of white flies.
[17:03.540 --> 17:07.660]  So there's a product called Monterey Garden Spray and it will say Spinosad right on the
[17:07.660 --> 17:08.660]  bottle.
[17:08.660 --> 17:09.660]  It is very affordable.
[17:09.660 --> 17:11.540]  It is very easy to find.
[17:11.540 --> 17:15.100]  Another product I can recommend for you, we're starting to get a little more expensive.
[17:15.100 --> 17:18.940]  Also we're starting to get a little more dangerous, a little less gentle.
[17:18.940 --> 17:21.980]  Another product I'll recommend is something called Venerate.
[17:21.980 --> 17:26.780]  Venerate will wipe the shit out of almost every pest in your garden.
[17:26.780 --> 17:32.220]  Another product I can recommend for white flies is Botanigard ES and I also like a product
[17:32.220 --> 17:34.660]  called BioSeer WP.
[17:34.660 --> 17:37.620]  Both of those products contain a beneficial fungus.
[17:37.620 --> 17:38.620]  I'm trying to remember the name.
[17:38.620 --> 17:45.220]  It is actually called Boveria bassiana, which is very good at destroying white flies.
[17:45.220 --> 17:48.920]  Now if you really want to step up your game, a really expensive product that will work
[17:48.920 --> 17:54.300]  to help you get rid of your white flies is a product called Mycotrawl ESO.
[17:54.300 --> 17:56.980]  Be forewarned, that one is not cheap.
[17:56.980 --> 17:58.100]  I don't know your budget.
[17:58.100 --> 17:59.460]  I don't know what you're working with.
[17:59.460 --> 18:04.300]  I don't know how nuclear you want to go, but that is a nice list of products that will
[18:04.300 --> 18:07.540]  work to eradicate your white flies.
[18:07.540 --> 18:13.500]  Now whatever you choose to use to get rid of these bugs, make sure you have a rotation.
[18:13.500 --> 18:16.540]  Don't spray the same product every three days.
[18:16.540 --> 18:22.120]  Spray one product on day one, apply a different product on day four, apply a different product
[18:22.120 --> 18:25.640]  on day seven if you can, then start the rotation over.
[18:25.640 --> 18:29.880]  But don't do the same product more than two times in a row no matter what you do.
[18:29.880 --> 18:33.660]  That is how you start giving these pests a resistance to the products you're buying.
[18:33.660 --> 18:35.780]  Your bugs are going to get stronger and stronger.
[18:35.780 --> 18:38.220]  You're going to create super bugs in there.
[18:38.220 --> 18:44.160]  Another thing you can do is you can tank mix multiple pesticides in an applicator at one
[18:44.160 --> 18:48.380]  time as long as those products are compatible.
[18:48.380 --> 18:52.340]  So before you go mixing a large batch of pesticide, if you're going to do a tank mix
[18:52.340 --> 18:57.340]  of multiple pesticides you've never ran together before, I suggest mixing a very small batch
[18:57.340 --> 19:00.340]  of them together, mix it up, see what happens.
[19:00.340 --> 19:03.100]  See if you get any weird chemical reactions out of it.
[19:03.100 --> 19:06.860]  If you don't get any weird reactions, mix up the desired amount which you want to apply
[19:06.860 --> 19:11.180]  to your plants, then pick one sacrificial plant and spray the shit out of it.
[19:11.180 --> 19:13.700]  See if that one plant does any weird shit.
[19:13.700 --> 19:16.500]  If it doesn't harm that plant, you've got a great mix.
[19:16.500 --> 19:18.860]  That is your new pesticide application.
[19:18.860 --> 19:20.440]  Write down exactly what went in there.
[19:20.440 --> 19:22.580]  Write down how much water you started with.
[19:22.580 --> 19:24.780]  Write down how much whatever product you put in there.
[19:24.780 --> 19:27.260]  Write down how much of the other product you put in there.
[19:27.260 --> 19:28.320]  Write it down.
[19:28.320 --> 19:30.140]  Write down when you sprayed.
[19:30.140 --> 19:31.940]  Write down what you saw from that.
[19:31.940 --> 19:33.260]  Take a lot of notes.
[19:33.260 --> 19:36.020]  We consume cannabis, so we forget a lot of shit.
[19:36.020 --> 19:38.180]  Make sure you write things down.
[19:38.180 --> 19:42.320]  If you want a great lesson on mixing multiple pesticides in one spray applicator for one
[19:42.320 --> 19:45.940]  good application, I highly recommend an episode I did called Tank Mix.
[19:46.380 --> 19:49.460]  It is episode number 289 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[19:49.460 --> 19:50.780]  Make sure you check that one out.
[19:50.780 --> 19:55.860]  I talk a lot about mixing pesticides and proper pesticide application.
[19:55.860 --> 19:59.620]  We've got a lot of spray pesticide application options.
[19:59.620 --> 20:02.220]  Another thing I would recommend is a root drench.
[20:02.220 --> 20:06.500]  Many of the products I recommended are also usable as a drench.
[20:06.500 --> 20:11.460]  I feel that maybe some of the larvae from your whiteflies has ended up in your medium.
[20:11.460 --> 20:13.720]  That's why you're having a hard time getting rid of them.
[20:13.720 --> 20:16.440]  You've got eggs just chilling down there in the soil.
[20:16.440 --> 20:17.680]  I would recommend a root drench.
[20:17.680 --> 20:22.160]  I would probably use the Evergreen or the Azimax or the Botaniguard.
[20:22.160 --> 20:25.960]  I would just mix that into some water and I would soak the roots thoroughly.
[20:25.960 --> 20:26.960]  Just water it in.
[20:26.960 --> 20:28.560]  Let it soak out through the bottom.
[20:28.560 --> 20:31.120]  That way you've got pesticide in your medium.
[20:31.120 --> 20:33.020]  We need to go nuclear like you said.
[20:33.020 --> 20:35.320]  We don't need to leave any open space.
[20:35.320 --> 20:38.320]  Let's get the leaves coated in nasty stickiness.
[20:38.320 --> 20:39.560]  Let's get the root zone.
[20:39.560 --> 20:42.160]  Let's get that medium coated in nasty stickiness.
[20:42.160 --> 20:45.840]  Let's not make it a desirable environment for these whiteflies.
[20:45.840 --> 20:50.000]  Now when you do a root drench, you do need to make sure not to suffocate the roots.
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.800]  So whatever your recommended dosage is for your foliar spray, I would probably reduce
[20:54.800 --> 20:59.120]  the root drench application to about half of whatever you are spraying.
[20:59.120 --> 21:03.660]  So if you're spraying 10 milliliters of a product, I would root drench with five.
[21:03.660 --> 21:08.580]  You can always root drench again with the increased dosage, but you can't undrench.
[21:08.580 --> 21:12.260]  So once those roots are coated in oil and you've got a problem, you're already pretty
[21:12.260 --> 21:13.260]  fucked.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.260]  So go light.
[21:14.260 --> 21:16.400]  Then if that doesn't do it, go harder next time.
[21:16.400 --> 21:17.780]  Pay close attention to the plants.
[21:17.780 --> 21:20.860]  Like I said, write everything down.
[21:20.860 --> 21:23.860]  Another thing we need to do is continue with the yellow sticky traps.
[21:23.860 --> 21:28.300]  Those yellow sticky traps are going to let us know how the population is sustaining.
[21:28.300 --> 21:32.180]  We'll know if there are less, if there are more whiteflies than there were before.
[21:32.180 --> 21:34.580]  One important thing is to change those sticky traps.
[21:34.580 --> 21:38.600]  If you leave the same trap up for too long, how do you know how many flies were gathered
[21:38.600 --> 21:39.980]  at one point in time?
[21:39.980 --> 21:43.140]  So make sure you rotate them on a frequent basis.
[21:43.140 --> 21:44.980]  Once a week is probably enough.
[21:44.980 --> 21:46.820]  So we have heavily defoliated.
[21:46.820 --> 21:49.120]  We've taken all that foliage out of the grow.
[21:49.120 --> 21:50.120]  It's out of the house.
[21:50.120 --> 21:51.340]  It's as far away as we can get it.
[21:51.340 --> 21:52.340]  We have burned it.
[21:52.340 --> 21:53.340]  It is gone.
[21:53.340 --> 21:57.900]  Then we have applied ridiculous amounts of pesticides on a routine schedule.
[21:57.900 --> 22:00.700]  We're spraying every three days and we are rotating.
[22:00.700 --> 22:03.840]  We are possibly doing a tank mix with multiple pesticides.
[22:03.840 --> 22:06.280]  This is going to knock down the populations.
[22:06.280 --> 22:07.880]  Then we're going to do a root drench.
[22:07.880 --> 22:11.200]  This is going to make sure that none of the larvae, none of the eggs are chilling in the
[22:11.200 --> 22:12.200]  medium.
[22:12.200 --> 22:16.560]  Now we've in theory destroyed all of the bugs we're trying to get rid of.
[22:16.560 --> 22:19.520]  What are we going to do to make sure they don't come back?
[22:19.520 --> 22:22.240]  It sounds like the first step is to seal the room.
[22:22.240 --> 22:27.040]  The next step is to think of an integrated pest management strategy that will make sure
[22:27.040 --> 22:30.400]  we don't get these bugs back when we are late in flower.
[22:30.400 --> 22:34.240]  It is really easy to get rid of these bugs with our mother plants, with our veg plants
[22:34.240 --> 22:37.240]  because we can just go spraying every three days.
[22:37.240 --> 22:40.040]  Once we've got buds, we can't spray anymore.
[22:40.040 --> 22:44.760]  What are we going to do to make sure we don't get bugs later in flower?
[22:44.760 --> 22:47.200]  This is where I like to introduce predator insects.
[22:47.200 --> 22:50.920]  Spider mites, thrips, fungus gnats, white flies.
[22:50.920 --> 22:55.800]  I don't care what kind of bug you are, you cannot build a resistance to being eaten by
[22:55.800 --> 22:57.520]  a predator.
[22:57.520 --> 23:02.840]  Once you have eradicated your infestation and you are sure that 99.9% of these white
[23:02.840 --> 23:08.520]  flies are gone, I would switch my strategy and invest heavily in predator bugs.
[23:08.520 --> 23:12.680]  If you are at a point where you have only got mother plants and or veg plants, you are
[23:12.680 --> 23:15.320]  at a huge advantage to start with predator bugs.
[23:15.320 --> 23:18.560]  It is a great time to start building colonies.
[23:18.560 --> 23:23.520]  You can purchase enough predator bugs to build a large enough colony to overtake any sort
[23:23.520 --> 23:29.220]  of invaders that may try to come in if you start with your moms and your veg plants.
[23:29.220 --> 23:35.000]  The idea would be to get enough predator insects on those veg plants where when you take clones,
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.560]  you move some predators right along with the clones.
[23:37.560 --> 23:42.880]  Then those veg plants start to grow and those predator insects will colonize on your veg
[23:42.880 --> 23:43.880]  plants.
[23:43.880 --> 23:45.440]  They are partying, they are breeding, they are living life.
[23:45.440 --> 23:48.280]  They are just colonizing and they are expanding with the growth.
[23:48.280 --> 23:49.680]  They become a part of the growth.
[23:49.680 --> 23:52.160]  You create a symbiosis.
[23:52.160 --> 23:53.320]  That's what happens outside.
[23:53.320 --> 23:54.820]  That's what happens in nature.
[23:54.820 --> 23:58.440]  If you get bug A, bug B will come along and say, hey, look, a bunch of these and it will
[23:58.440 --> 23:59.440]  eat it.
[23:59.440 --> 24:01.680]  Then they will either move along or they will try to colonize.
[24:01.680 --> 24:05.720]  If they get too much, if they get too comfortable, if they get too fancy, bug C will come along
[24:05.720 --> 24:08.040]  and say, no, bro, this is our territory.
[24:08.040 --> 24:09.880]  They will eat bug B and they will run them off.
[24:09.880 --> 24:13.160]  Then those bugs will either move along to the next garden and keep playing security
[24:13.160 --> 24:15.280]  that way or they will repeat the process.
[24:15.280 --> 24:16.280]  They will try to hang out.
[24:16.280 --> 24:19.640]  They will run out of bugs to eat and they will die or they will leave or something will
[24:19.640 --> 24:20.640]  come and eat them.
[24:20.640 --> 24:22.240]  That's how it happens in nature.
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.800]  We can replicate that in our grow rooms if we use a well thought out integrated pest
[24:26.800 --> 24:28.400]  management strategy.
[24:28.400 --> 24:32.600]  Now something you're going to have to be careful with is, are the pesticides you are using
[24:32.600 --> 24:36.400]  going to endanger your predators that you're paying money for?
[24:36.400 --> 24:40.600]  In a lot of commercial environments, I will start the mother rooms and the bedrooms by
[24:40.600 --> 24:42.760]  using pesticide applications.
[24:42.760 --> 24:47.480]  As we move into the later bedrooms and the flower areas, I will begin releasing large
[24:47.480 --> 24:49.720]  amounts of predator bugs.
[24:49.720 --> 24:53.560]  My budget may be a little bit different than most people's because I'm working on a commercial
[24:53.560 --> 24:54.560]  scale.
[24:54.560 --> 24:59.480]  Also, the value of my crop is more critical than some folks because I am working on a
[24:59.480 --> 25:00.600]  large commercial scale.
[25:00.600 --> 25:02.800]  I'm not downplaying the size of your garden.
[25:02.800 --> 25:05.120]  I'm just saying that we have to be a little more careful.
[25:05.120 --> 25:08.960]  We're going to lose hundreds of pounds compared to somebody losing one or two pounds in a
[25:08.960 --> 25:09.960]  home grow.
[25:09.960 --> 25:13.800]  Yes, you're out of medicine, but if I lose hundreds of pounds, people are out of jobs,
[25:13.800 --> 25:14.800]  businesses fail.
[25:14.800 --> 25:16.760]  It is a very huge loss.
[25:16.800 --> 25:21.760]  My strategy is to go very hard on the moms, go very hard in the veg phase, make sure I
[25:21.760 --> 25:26.400]  do not get any pests, any pathogens, any problems throughout that cycle.
[25:26.400 --> 25:30.600]  Late in veg or right at the start of flower, I start adjusting my pesticide application
[25:30.600 --> 25:34.640]  schedule to make sure I'm not applying anything that will be harmful or detrimental to my
[25:34.640 --> 25:35.640]  predator bugs.
[25:35.640 --> 25:42.200]  Then, I like to switch to releasing large, ridiculous amounts of predatory mites.
[25:42.200 --> 25:45.520]  I've got that residual pesticide hanging out for a couple of weeks.
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.240]  When that starts to degrade, then by the time all that pesticide breaks down, it's
[25:49.240 --> 25:51.040]  no longer active on my plants.
[25:51.040 --> 25:53.240]  My predatory mites have had time to colonize.
[25:53.240 --> 25:55.920]  I've got a big army in there, and I've still got protection.
[25:55.920 --> 26:00.320]  I know that I don't have any chance for spider mites or anything like that to come take a
[26:00.320 --> 26:01.920]  hold in my garden.
[26:01.920 --> 26:04.080]  You've got a couple of options for this strategy.
[26:04.080 --> 26:07.880]  You can either start by letting the predatory mites go in the mom room, get them in the
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.600]  veg room, get them started early, get them colonizing, or you can start with pesticides
[26:12.600 --> 26:13.600]  early.
[26:13.600 --> 26:16.800]  Then, when you move to the flowering phase, when it's no longer a good idea to spray,
[26:16.800 --> 26:20.120]  you can start releasing your predatory mites and start working things that way.
[26:20.120 --> 26:24.080]  You've got a few things to think about, but I think with all the information I have given
[26:24.080 --> 26:27.400]  you, we should be able to get rid of those white flies.
[26:27.400 --> 26:30.880]  Let's talk more specifically about some of the predatory bugs that you could use, and
[26:30.880 --> 26:33.240]  then we're going to get out of here for this episode.
[26:33.240 --> 26:36.160]  I really appreciate lacewings in a garden.
[26:36.160 --> 26:39.320]  I feel like lacewings are hungry and aggressive.
[26:39.320 --> 26:43.400]  I am most familiar with the lacewings that come in the eggs that are on the black sheet
[26:43.400 --> 26:45.920]  that you hang in different locations throughout the grow.
[26:45.920 --> 26:47.480]  Those are what I'm most familiar with.
[26:47.480 --> 26:49.320]  I like to watch them come alive.
[26:49.320 --> 26:52.660]  They turn into a little crocodile-looking thing, and then eventually they turn into
[26:52.660 --> 26:54.120]  a green lacewing.
[26:54.120 --> 26:55.120]  Those things are hungry.
[26:55.120 --> 26:59.320]  They are so hungry that I believe they become carnivorous.
[26:59.320 --> 27:01.880]  They will eat every pest in your garden.
[27:01.880 --> 27:04.800]  Then they will turn on their friends and family.
[27:04.800 --> 27:07.960]  Green lacewings are awesome in any garden.
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.480]  The next predatory mite that I would recommend that works on a plethora of garden pests is
[27:13.480 --> 27:16.000]  the Swarski predatory mite.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.360]  I release Swarski mites on a regular basis in any commercial grow environment that I
[27:20.360 --> 27:22.120]  am responsible for.
[27:22.120 --> 27:26.720]  I can also recommend kookamaris and minute pirate bugs.
[27:26.720 --> 27:30.520]  Predatory mites can get a little bit expensive, but if all you've got are mother plants, you
[27:30.520 --> 27:35.320]  have a great opportunity to start colonies in a small garden.
[27:35.320 --> 27:40.080]  All you've got to do is hang up some yellow sticky traps, defoliate like a motherfucker,
[27:40.080 --> 27:45.700]  do some research on several pesticides, select the few that work for you, create a nice rotation
[27:45.700 --> 27:51.580]  of pesticides, start applying them diligently until you knock down that population, then
[27:51.580 --> 27:53.120]  decide how you want to proceed.
[27:53.120 --> 27:56.780]  Are you going to keep going with the pesticides, or are you going to start using some sort
[27:56.780 --> 27:58.140]  of predators?
[27:58.140 --> 28:01.600]  You also need to seal up that room and figure out where those bugs are coming from.
[28:01.600 --> 28:03.760]  You've got a very small crack somewhere.
[28:03.760 --> 28:06.160]  They have found that crack and they are making their way in.
[28:06.160 --> 28:08.600]  So we've got to figure out how to seal that up.
[28:08.600 --> 28:10.520]  But I think we can get rid of these white flies.
[28:10.520 --> 28:12.520]  White flies aren't as big of a problem as they seem like.
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.880]  They're more of a pain in the ass.
[28:13.880 --> 28:14.880]  They're more ugly.
[28:14.880 --> 28:16.680]  They're more annoying than anything else.
[28:16.680 --> 28:19.240]  But if we stay on top of it, we will get them out of your garden.
[28:19.240 --> 28:21.720]  Hey, I want to thank you for a great email.
