[00:17.850 --> 00:20.810]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.810 --> 00:22.610]  It's time for episode number 173
[00:22.610 --> 00:24.170]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.170 --> 00:27.730]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.730 --> 00:28.850]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.850 --> 00:30.170]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.170 --> 00:32.610]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.610 --> 00:34.510]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:34.510 --> 00:37.010]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.010 --> 00:40.010]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.010 --> 00:41.810]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:41.810 --> 00:43.650]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.650 --> 00:45.770]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.770 --> 00:47.330]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.370 --> 00:49.610]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.610 --> 00:53.170]  Big shout to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.730 --> 00:56.090]  Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:56.090 --> 00:58.090]  If I plan this right, this will be coming out
[00:58.090 --> 00:59.930]  right at the start of 2017.
[00:59.930 --> 01:01.610]  I wanna wish everybody a happy New Year.
[01:01.610 --> 01:04.310]  I hope 2016 was perfect for you,
[01:04.310 --> 01:07.570]  but I hope 2017 is even better.
[01:07.570 --> 01:11.210]  I've got a lot of great shit lined up for myself in 2017.
[01:11.210 --> 01:12.890]  I've got good things lined up for the podcast.
[01:12.890 --> 01:15.410]  I have great stuff lined up for iRegenetics.
[01:15.410 --> 01:19.090]  I hope everything goes your way in 2017, you guys.
[01:19.090 --> 01:21.050]  I wanna thank everybody for listening
[01:21.050 --> 01:22.530]  all the way through 2016.
[01:22.530 --> 01:24.690]  We're 173 episodes in, you guys.
[01:24.690 --> 01:25.990]  I am proud, I am impressed.
[01:25.990 --> 01:28.290]  I wanna thank you guys for joining me on this journey.
[01:28.290 --> 01:30.290]  Also, I wanna give a huge shout out
[01:30.290 --> 01:31.570]  to my friend the Dabbing Granny
[01:31.570 --> 01:33.510]  and all of my friends that joined us.
[01:33.510 --> 01:36.130]  We had a little private party just a few days ago.
[01:36.130 --> 01:39.930]  We all met up somewhere and we hung out and took some dabs.
[01:39.930 --> 01:40.810]  Let's see, who was there?
[01:40.810 --> 01:41.770]  There were a lot of people there,
[01:41.770 --> 01:43.890]  so I'm going to miss a few people,
[01:43.890 --> 01:45.410]  but I wanna mention my new friend, Jerry.
[01:45.410 --> 01:47.170]  I don't know if Jerry listens to the podcast yet,
[01:47.170 --> 01:48.890]  but I made a new friend named Jerry,
[01:48.890 --> 01:51.710]  and he's got a wonderful companion animal with him.
[01:51.710 --> 01:53.130]  His dog is super cool.
[01:53.130 --> 01:56.750]  I also met your better half, but I cannot think of her name.
[01:56.750 --> 01:58.710]  I'm not sure we were properly introduced,
[01:58.710 --> 02:00.490]  but I'm glad that I finally got to meet Jerry.
[02:00.490 --> 02:02.170]  I've heard a lot of cool stuff about you.
[02:02.170 --> 02:03.530]  Honor and a pleasure to meet Jerry.
[02:03.530 --> 02:04.770]  So at the party, there was Jerry.
[02:04.770 --> 02:06.830]  There was, of course, the Dabbing Granny.
[02:06.830 --> 02:08.930]  The lovely Camille was there.
[02:08.930 --> 02:10.770]  THC Samuel was there.
[02:10.770 --> 02:12.410]  Bobo Blaster Co. was there.
[02:12.410 --> 02:15.090]  Lindsey the Traveling Stoner was there.
[02:15.090 --> 02:17.230]  There was a young man who I never caught his name,
[02:17.230 --> 02:19.130]  but he gave me a dab that we will talk about
[02:19.130 --> 02:21.250]  in just a couple of minutes.
[02:21.250 --> 02:22.330]  There were a lot of people there, you guys.
[02:22.330 --> 02:23.810]  I can't even try to go through the list
[02:23.810 --> 02:25.450]  of all the people that were at the little gathering
[02:25.450 --> 02:26.690]  that I participated in,
[02:26.690 --> 02:28.930]  but I wanna give the Dabbing Granny a huge shout out
[02:28.930 --> 02:30.690]  for inviting me to the party.
[02:30.690 --> 02:31.930]  We did a gram dab together.
[02:31.930 --> 02:33.670]  I promised everybody on Instagram
[02:33.670 --> 02:36.730]  that if I got up to 10,000 Instagram followers,
[02:36.730 --> 02:39.210]  I would do a one gram dab with the Dabbing Granny,
[02:39.210 --> 02:40.490]  and it happened.
[02:40.490 --> 02:42.730]  She gave me a damn grab.
[02:42.730 --> 02:44.570]  Yeah, it was pretty much a damn grab.
[02:44.570 --> 02:49.210]  She gave me a gram dab of OG Kush Distillate,
[02:49.210 --> 02:50.950]  and I took it like a champ.
[02:50.950 --> 02:53.130]  The nail cooled down a little bit too quickly
[02:53.130 --> 02:54.290]  for me to get the whole dab.
[02:54.290 --> 02:55.890]  Once all the Distillate hit the nail,
[02:55.890 --> 02:57.730]  because I just squirted that sucker on there,
[02:57.730 --> 02:59.970]  once it hit the nail, it kinda cooled down,
[02:59.970 --> 03:01.610]  but I took a dab like a champ.
[03:01.610 --> 03:03.250]  So big shout out to all the people that went to the party.
[03:03.250 --> 03:05.810]  Let's talk about some of these dabs I took, you guys.
[03:05.810 --> 03:08.330]  I took a gram dab of OG Kush Distillate.
[03:08.330 --> 03:10.170]  I heated the nail real hot,
[03:10.850 --> 03:13.770]  and then the Distillate comes in like a,
[03:13.770 --> 03:14.930]  it is a syringe, you guys,
[03:14.930 --> 03:16.850]  but when I say the word syringe, people get freaked out.
[03:16.850 --> 03:19.770]  It's a glass syringe, but it does not have the tip on it.
[03:19.770 --> 03:21.570]  It doesn't have the pokey.
[03:21.570 --> 03:22.830]  You can't poke anything with it.
[03:22.830 --> 03:24.770]  It just looks like a syringe.
[03:24.770 --> 03:27.270]  It looks like something you would use to feed a baby bird
[03:27.270 --> 03:29.970]  is what I think it would be best described as.
[03:29.970 --> 03:32.190]  So this little syringe, it's got Distillate in it,
[03:32.190 --> 03:34.130]  raw Distillate, which was,
[03:34.130 --> 03:35.770]  I'm gonna turn on the music, I'm sorry.
[03:35.770 --> 03:39.170]  The Distillate is probably 90% THC.
[03:39.170 --> 03:41.650]  There's not a lot of flavor to it,
[03:41.650 --> 03:44.850]  but you put it in these little glass syringes,
[03:44.850 --> 03:45.690]  and it's kind of hard to get out.
[03:45.690 --> 03:47.370]  So I hit it with a torch for a couple of seconds
[03:47.370 --> 03:49.490]  to heat it up and make it more viscous.
[03:49.490 --> 03:52.850]  And then I heat the nail, and the heat from the dab nail
[03:52.850 --> 03:55.850]  and the heat that I applied with my dab torch
[03:55.850 --> 03:57.970]  worked together, and I just pressed the tip
[03:57.970 --> 04:01.330]  of the glass syringe onto the dab nail,
[04:01.330 --> 04:04.010]  and I just pressed the plunger of that syringe down,
[04:04.010 --> 04:05.470]  and it took a second to get it going,
[04:05.470 --> 04:09.230]  but once it released, almost all of that dab
[04:09.230 --> 04:10.830]  went onto the nail immediately.
[04:10.830 --> 04:13.990]  So it was just, blah, just one big gush of liquid dabs
[04:13.990 --> 04:16.950]  onto the nail, and I got all that smoke in my brain
[04:16.950 --> 04:18.430]  basically in one big rip.
[04:18.430 --> 04:20.730]  I took two or three breaths to clear the whole thing,
[04:20.730 --> 04:22.830]  but I got most of the smoke in one big rip.
[04:22.830 --> 04:25.190]  It went to my brain immediately.
[04:25.190 --> 04:26.110]  It was amazing.
[04:26.990 --> 04:30.130]  The OG Kush made me melt into the couch.
[04:30.130 --> 04:34.830]  I felt my butt grew roots, and I became part of that couch.
[04:35.030 --> 04:38.310]  I had to set the rig down, and I immediately had to stand up
[04:38.310 --> 04:40.190]  and tell everybody, I have to walk around,
[04:40.190 --> 04:43.230]  because if I sit here, I'm going to take a nap
[04:43.230 --> 04:45.190]  at this private party where they are not going
[04:45.190 --> 04:47.590]  to appreciate my giant six-foot-five self
[04:47.590 --> 04:51.390]  taking a nap and snoring like an angry bear,
[04:51.390 --> 04:52.790]  because it was gonna be kind of a hibernation
[04:52.790 --> 04:53.950]  if I laid down at that point.
[04:53.950 --> 04:55.350]  I was recti.
[04:55.350 --> 04:57.670]  So I got up, I walked around for a little bit.
[04:57.670 --> 04:59.430]  Actually, there's a video of this
[04:59.430 --> 05:02.350]  on the Dabbing Granny's Facebook.
[05:02.350 --> 05:04.710]  I'm pretty sure she did it on Facebook Live.
[05:05.550 --> 05:06.390]  I hope it was Facebook Live,
[05:06.390 --> 05:07.670]  because anything else, it disappears.
[05:07.670 --> 05:09.190]  So it's probably there on Facebook Live.
[05:09.190 --> 05:11.110]  If you want to check out the Dabbing Granny's Facebook Live,
[05:11.110 --> 05:11.950]  look for it.
[05:11.950 --> 05:13.790]  Either way, look at the Dabbing Granny's Facebook Live.
[05:13.790 --> 05:15.270]  It's on her Instagram, actually.
[05:15.270 --> 05:18.350]  It is on her Instagram, the Dabbing Granny's Instagram.
[05:18.350 --> 05:21.190]  You guys, I don't post Dab videos to my Instagram,
[05:21.190 --> 05:24.070]  because the Instagram police have been shutting down
[05:24.070 --> 05:25.990]  Instagram accounts in the cannabis community
[05:25.990 --> 05:29.230]  for random reasons, and I do not want to lose my account.
[05:29.230 --> 05:31.130]  So you won't see many smoking videos of me,
[05:31.130 --> 05:34.230]  but you will see some wonderful cannabis photography.
[05:34.750 --> 05:35.830]  I post great pictures of male plants.
[05:35.830 --> 05:37.970]  I post great pictures of my grow.
[05:37.970 --> 05:38.810]  Great stuff like that.
[05:38.810 --> 05:40.070]  The commercial grows that I help in,
[05:40.070 --> 05:40.990]  I post pictures there.
[05:40.990 --> 05:42.170]  The places I go consult,
[05:42.170 --> 05:44.590]  I'll take a nice picture from there sometimes.
[05:44.590 --> 05:47.830]  But I won't post many pictures of myself consuming.
[05:47.830 --> 05:50.270]  So I did this gram dab of Distil-It,
[05:50.270 --> 05:51.990]  and I was high as giraffe pussy, you guys.
[05:51.990 --> 05:53.670]  I was spinning around, I was floating,
[05:53.670 --> 05:54.830]  but I was in good shape.
[05:55.790 --> 05:57.550]  Most people probably would have laid on the couch
[05:57.550 --> 05:58.830]  and taken a four or five hour nap.
[05:58.830 --> 06:00.950]  I just had to stand up, walk around,
[06:00.950 --> 06:02.770]  keep myself social, and keep moving,
[06:02.770 --> 06:03.950]  and I was okay with everything.
[06:04.670 --> 06:07.190]  As long as I stayed moving, stayed bouncy, I was okay.
[06:07.190 --> 06:08.590]  Several minutes after I took that dab,
[06:08.590 --> 06:11.150]  another guy whose name I did not catch,
[06:11.150 --> 06:13.030]  he had a beautiful dab rig,
[06:13.030 --> 06:16.430]  a super colorful mini tube with a donut shape on it.
[06:16.430 --> 06:17.830]  Fucking gorgeous rig.
[06:17.830 --> 06:19.750]  Never caught the dude's name.
[06:19.750 --> 06:20.590]  I apologize.
[06:20.590 --> 06:22.270]  There were a lot of people there.
[06:22.270 --> 06:24.730]  We had a good time together, but I never caught your name.
[06:24.730 --> 06:26.790]  So if you're listening, send me a message.
[06:26.790 --> 06:27.770]  You know who you are.
[06:27.770 --> 06:28.790]  You gave me a dab.
[06:28.790 --> 06:31.610]  So anyway, you guys, the guy I'm talking to gave me a dab
[06:31.610 --> 06:36.610]  of 99.9% THC isolate, or Isotol, I've heard it called also,
[06:38.410 --> 06:43.130]  but it was basically just THC crystals in a crystal form,
[06:43.130 --> 06:44.810]  not like crystals like you.
[06:44.810 --> 06:47.970]  Like people call THC crystals just the trichomes.
[06:47.970 --> 06:49.370]  They say it's got a lot of crystals,
[06:49.370 --> 06:52.170]  but this was a crystalline form of THC.
[06:52.170 --> 06:57.170]  They have extracted everything and just have THC in this.
[06:57.290 --> 06:59.570]  It looked like salt or sugar chunks,
[06:59.690 --> 07:01.790]  or other drugs in a little container.
[07:01.790 --> 07:04.690]  And you just sprinkle a little bit of it into the dab nail.
[07:04.690 --> 07:05.890]  And it didn't have any flavor.
[07:05.890 --> 07:06.970]  When it went in my lungs,
[07:06.970 --> 07:10.310]  I could feel there was some smoke in my lungs or some vapor,
[07:10.310 --> 07:12.050]  I guess it would be in my lungs,
[07:12.050 --> 07:15.930]  but I really didn't get, it didn't feel normal.
[07:15.930 --> 07:17.370]  It didn't feel like when you smoke flowers,
[07:17.370 --> 07:18.730]  it didn't feel like when I take a dab,
[07:18.730 --> 07:20.170]  there was no chest expansion.
[07:20.170 --> 07:22.490]  Like when I take a dab, I feel my chest expand a little bit.
[07:22.490 --> 07:24.290]  I feel the smoke wanting to get out.
[07:25.390 --> 07:27.130]  This THC dab was super smooth.
[07:27.130 --> 07:28.290]  It went in.
[07:28.290 --> 07:30.810]  I looked at him like, I didn't notice a damn thing.
[07:30.810 --> 07:31.850]  And he nodded.
[07:31.850 --> 07:34.130]  Like when you blow that out, you're gonna get fucked up.
[07:34.130 --> 07:35.270]  And I started to blow it out.
[07:35.270 --> 07:37.790]  And when my body made,
[07:37.790 --> 07:39.290]  so guys, I don't know if everybody else does this,
[07:39.290 --> 07:40.370]  but when I'm about to exhale,
[07:40.370 --> 07:41.970]  my lips make a certain thing
[07:41.970 --> 07:43.610]  so that I can exhale at the right speed
[07:43.610 --> 07:44.690]  so that I don't go,
[07:44.690 --> 07:47.330]  and just blow all the air out at once and choke.
[07:47.330 --> 07:48.450]  You kinda, what's the word?
[07:48.450 --> 07:50.090]  You parse your lips a little bit.
[07:51.290 --> 07:52.850]  And you blow it like that, right?
[07:52.850 --> 07:54.610]  When you're blowing up a balloon, you make a certain face.
[07:54.610 --> 07:57.570]  When you're blowing out a dab, you make a certain shape.
[07:57.610 --> 08:00.210]  As soon as I made those muscles to make my lungs,
[08:00.210 --> 08:02.090]  my lips prepared to blow out the dab,
[08:02.090 --> 08:03.690]  I felt how high I was.
[08:03.690 --> 08:06.810]  I went, and I was like, oh God, there it is.
[08:06.810 --> 08:09.090]  And I could feel, I felt my face turn red.
[08:09.090 --> 08:10.370]  I could feel my eyes droop.
[08:10.370 --> 08:12.210]  And that dude goes, yeah, you've noticed that?
[08:12.210 --> 08:14.670]  And granny goes, that's good shit, isn't it, Jeff?
[08:14.670 --> 08:17.090]  And I couldn't answer her properly as I blew it out.
[08:17.090 --> 08:20.130]  I was like, that's really good.
[08:20.130 --> 08:21.090]  I was high.
[08:21.090 --> 08:24.130]  My arm hair was standing up and moving around.
[08:24.130 --> 08:26.230]  My nipples were hard.
[08:26.230 --> 08:27.170]  I don't know why.
[08:27.770 --> 08:29.210]  Sometimes when I take a giant dab that works well,
[08:29.210 --> 08:30.650]  it makes my nips get all hard.
[08:30.650 --> 08:32.650]  My nips were diamond cutters.
[08:32.650 --> 08:34.250]  It was ridiculous.
[08:34.250 --> 08:37.510]  I was intoxicated for a couple of seconds.
[08:38.450 --> 08:39.690]  I had to kind of chill out for a second
[08:39.690 --> 08:41.130]  and get my shit together.
[08:41.130 --> 08:42.530]  The dude had a gorgeous rig,
[08:42.530 --> 08:44.970]  but it had a donut shape at the bottom of it.
[08:44.970 --> 08:46.670]  And he had a nice banger on it,
[08:46.670 --> 08:48.290]  but I couldn't tell you much more about that rig
[08:48.290 --> 08:49.550]  other than my brain remembers
[08:49.550 --> 08:50.770]  that it was colorful and gorgeous.
[08:50.770 --> 08:52.690]  And I can't even remember the dude's name.
[08:52.690 --> 08:53.850]  That's how good that dab was.
[08:53.850 --> 08:55.570]  I'm pretty good at absorbing names
[08:55.570 --> 08:57.290]  and putting names with faces.
[08:57.290 --> 08:59.770]  That dude's fucking face and name, they're gone.
[08:59.770 --> 09:00.770]  The rig is gone.
[09:00.770 --> 09:02.250]  All I remember is the dab, you guys.
[09:02.250 --> 09:04.190]  That's how tremendous that dab was.
[09:04.190 --> 09:05.730]  So also, let's see,
[09:05.730 --> 09:07.930]  what else did I consume at the little party there?
[09:07.930 --> 09:11.690]  Our friend Caleb from Schumet brought some Schumet bars.
[09:11.690 --> 09:13.670]  I have never tried the red velvet bar.
[09:13.670 --> 09:15.090]  I brag all, or I boast.
[09:15.090 --> 09:15.930]  I don't know what I do.
[09:15.930 --> 09:16.750]  What do I say?
[09:16.750 --> 09:18.730]  I say I love that banana pudding bar.
[09:18.730 --> 09:21.990]  You guys, the red velvet bar is every bit as good.
[09:21.990 --> 09:24.210]  Although I'm a banana fan, I like the banana more,
[09:24.210 --> 09:25.130]  with that red velvet.
[09:25.130 --> 09:27.870]  I think it's red velvet cake or red velvet, whatever.
[09:27.870 --> 09:28.850]  Delicious, you guys.
[09:28.850 --> 09:29.690]  I had some of that.
[09:29.690 --> 09:32.450]  We passed around a couple candy bars.
[09:32.450 --> 09:33.650]  I ate a couple pieces of that.
[09:33.650 --> 09:35.930]  By the time everything kicked in,
[09:35.930 --> 09:37.690]  I was well-medicated for the party.
[09:37.690 --> 09:38.770]  It was a good time.
[09:38.770 --> 09:41.450]  So I guess I've just been bragging
[09:41.450 --> 09:43.090]  about all the cool shit I got to smoke and eat.
[09:43.090 --> 09:43.930]  I'm sorry.
[09:43.930 --> 09:44.770]  No, I wanted to share that with you guys.
[09:44.770 --> 09:47.290]  I got to smoke OG Kush Distil.
[09:47.290 --> 09:48.530]  I did a gram dab.
[09:48.530 --> 09:53.210]  I got to smoke probably a 0.2 or a 0.3 of 99% THC.
[09:53.210 --> 09:56.870]  And then of course we took 10 or 20 normal shatter dabs.
[09:56.870 --> 09:59.530]  Granny had some lemon shatter that was delicious.
[09:59.530 --> 10:02.090]  Our friend Lindsey and Bobo had some tangy shatter
[10:02.090 --> 10:03.490]  that was delicious.
[10:03.490 --> 10:05.370]  Everybody that showed up had some great concentrates.
[10:05.370 --> 10:07.550]  So I want to give Granny a big, huge shout out.
[10:07.550 --> 10:09.130]  Granny put the whole party together.
[10:09.130 --> 10:10.450]  She made sure everybody showed up.
[10:10.450 --> 10:12.190]  She had a place put together for us.
[10:12.190 --> 10:13.610]  I want to give a huge shout out to the place
[10:13.610 --> 10:15.970]  that let us have our little gathering.
[10:15.970 --> 10:18.430]  I'm not sure we were supposed to be smoking
[10:18.430 --> 10:21.830]  so many dabs and flowers in that place, but we did.
[10:21.830 --> 10:23.630]  Yeah, we also smoked a bunch of great flower in there.
[10:23.630 --> 10:24.870]  I took some flowers.
[10:24.870 --> 10:26.950]  Hey you guys, I normally don't smoke a bunch of flower,
[10:26.950 --> 10:28.510]  but I took some great flowers that I grew
[10:28.510 --> 10:29.870]  and I was sharing those with my friends
[10:29.870 --> 10:32.790]  and people were really pleased with my most recent harvest.
[10:32.790 --> 10:34.830]  So that was a good time.
[10:34.830 --> 10:35.830]  Big shout out to Granny.
[10:35.830 --> 10:37.570]  Big shout out to everybody that made it to the party.
[10:37.570 --> 10:38.510]  Since I'm giving shout outs,
[10:38.510 --> 10:40.970]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Tater.
[10:40.970 --> 10:42.850]  Tater Glass.
[10:42.850 --> 10:44.150]  Tater came through huge, you guys.
[10:44.150 --> 10:45.670]  Tater Glass is a glass artist.
[10:45.670 --> 10:48.430]  He has made me a couple few custom glass pencils.
[10:48.430 --> 10:51.210]  Right now I'm holding my, this is green.
[10:51.730 --> 10:52.890]  I'm not sure what type of green this is,
[10:52.890 --> 10:55.250]  but it has a red, yellow, and green wig wag.
[10:55.250 --> 10:57.570]  It's got more wig than wag to it at the tip,
[10:57.570 --> 10:59.390]  or at the pencil, or at the eraser end, I'm sorry.
[10:59.390 --> 11:01.290]  At the writing tip it is red, gold, and green,
[11:01.290 --> 11:02.410]  Rasta colors.
[11:02.410 --> 11:03.370]  They're kind of twisted.
[11:03.370 --> 11:04.570]  It looks pretty sweet.
[11:04.570 --> 11:05.970]  It's a great looking pencil.
[11:05.970 --> 11:08.450]  On the eraser end where the eraser would be, you guys,
[11:08.450 --> 11:10.130]  it has got a lion.
[11:10.130 --> 11:11.930]  I think you guys would call it a millie.
[11:11.930 --> 11:14.110]  I think it actually is a marini,
[11:14.110 --> 11:16.250]  but it's a great looking lion on the tip.
[11:16.250 --> 11:18.170]  Great pencil from my friend Tater Glass.
[11:18.170 --> 11:21.490]  Also, I've got this blue pencil from Tater.
[11:21.490 --> 11:24.690]  Now it is clear and it's got some glacier blue on one end
[11:24.690 --> 11:26.610]  with a cobalt on the other end
[11:26.610 --> 11:29.970]  with a cobalt blue, glacier blue swirl on the tip.
[11:29.970 --> 11:30.850]  Great looking pencil.
[11:30.850 --> 11:31.690]  I love that.
[11:31.690 --> 11:32.590]  Then I got this green one.
[11:32.590 --> 11:37.110]  I think this might be a Haterade or green stardust.
[11:37.110 --> 11:37.950]  I'm not sure.
[11:37.950 --> 11:40.410]  And then it's got some purple on both tips of it.
[11:40.410 --> 11:41.570]  Sweet pencils.
[11:41.570 --> 11:43.410]  Because I'm not even sure what half of these colors
[11:43.410 --> 11:45.670]  that these glass artists use are called anymore
[11:45.670 --> 11:48.010]  because they are making more colors
[11:48.850 --> 11:49.890]  and there's no purple or blue.
[11:49.890 --> 11:52.850]  It's like plum or like blue stardust
[11:52.850 --> 11:54.650]  and red is called red Elvis.
[11:54.650 --> 11:56.530]  So the color names are pretty awesome.
[11:56.530 --> 11:58.010]  And if you don't call it the right name,
[11:58.010 --> 12:00.770]  a glass artist will fucking correct you really quickly.
[12:00.770 --> 12:03.130]  But the reason I want to give Tater an extra huge shout out
[12:03.130 --> 12:04.410]  is because right around Christmas,
[12:04.410 --> 12:06.810]  I got an idea that I should get one more gift for somebody.
[12:06.810 --> 12:08.370]  And I decided that I wanted to get them
[12:08.370 --> 12:11.090]  a custom made Tater Glass pencil.
[12:11.090 --> 12:12.650]  They kept talking about wanting something
[12:12.650 --> 12:14.830]  sparkly green and glass.
[12:14.830 --> 12:15.670]  And I thought,
[12:15.670 --> 12:18.110]  I wanted a sparkly green glass Tater pencil.
[12:18.110 --> 12:20.990]  So I was able to get a green stardust
[12:20.990 --> 12:23.430]  and blue glacier Tater Glass pencil
[12:23.430 --> 12:26.070]  with a grateful dead bear.
[12:26.070 --> 12:28.470]  You guys are calling them Millie's,
[12:28.470 --> 12:29.690]  but I think they're Marini's,
[12:29.690 --> 12:31.110]  but it's got a grateful dead Marini
[12:31.110 --> 12:32.630]  or a Millie at the end of it.
[12:32.630 --> 12:33.470]  It looks great.
[12:33.470 --> 12:35.030]  Big thanks to my buddy Tater.
[12:35.030 --> 12:36.070]  Dude, I appreciate it.
[12:36.070 --> 12:37.630]  We're only Instagram friends.
[12:37.630 --> 12:38.990]  We need to be real friends, bro.
[12:38.990 --> 12:40.910]  We need to get together and use these pencils
[12:40.910 --> 12:43.390]  that we've got and take some fat globs together.
[12:43.390 --> 12:44.790]  So shout out to my friend Tater Glass.
[12:44.830 --> 12:46.030]  Big thanks for the gift.
[12:46.030 --> 12:49.290]  He made it really quickly after I asked for it.
[12:49.290 --> 12:52.550]  He shipped it the next day and it got to me within two days.
[12:52.550 --> 12:54.850]  So mad love, great work.
[12:54.850 --> 12:55.950]  I appreciate it.
[12:55.950 --> 12:58.310]  You guys, there is some real content to this podcast.
[12:58.310 --> 13:00.150]  I do have a huge topic to talk about,
[13:00.150 --> 13:00.990]  but you know how I do it.
[13:00.990 --> 13:01.870]  Before we get that far,
[13:01.870 --> 13:05.590]  I've got to do one super duper important ad.
[13:05.590 --> 13:06.430]  I want to give a huge shout out
[13:06.430 --> 13:08.950]  to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[13:08.950 --> 13:10.430]  That's right, if you need some shirts printed,

[13:11.790 --> 13:13.550]  if you need some stickers made,
[13:13.550 --> 13:15.090]  if you need some hat pins designed,
[13:15.090 --> 13:16.790]  my friends at Handmade Apparel can take care

[13:31.550 --> 13:33.030]  because they're the ones who I trust.
[13:33.030 --> 13:34.670]  And I am super picky.
[13:34.670 --> 13:37.110]  I'm super meticulous about how things are done.
[13:37.110 --> 13:40.950]  And I really like the way that these guys do things.
[13:41.550 --> 13:43.270]  You guys, I've got these Grow From Your Heart
[13:43.270 --> 13:44.590]  podcast hoodies.
[13:44.590 --> 13:47.010]  The logos are so fresh on there.
[13:47.010 --> 13:49.150]  I was blown away when I opened them out of the package.
[13:49.150 --> 13:51.190]  Chris and Lindsey came by and picked up theirs.
[13:51.190 --> 13:53.250]  They were super proud and super impressed with them.
[13:53.250 --> 13:54.110]  I've got a few left.
[13:54.110 --> 13:56.830]  If you were interested in a Grow From Your Heart podcast,

[13:58.270 --> 13:59.110]  send me an email.
[13:59.110 --> 14:01.070]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[14:01.070 --> 14:02.470]  I would love to tell you how to get
[14:02.470 --> 14:04.630]  one of these hoodies in your hands.
[14:04.630 --> 14:07.170]  All right, let's see, what else do we need to talk about?
[14:07.170 --> 14:08.430]  My breeding projects.
[14:08.430 --> 14:10.110]  You guys love it when I give you breeding updates.
[14:10.110 --> 14:11.430]  I've actually gotten emails saying,
[14:11.430 --> 14:12.790]  what happened to the breeding updates?
[14:12.790 --> 14:14.270]  Because I don't do it on every episode.
[14:14.270 --> 14:15.910]  So let's talk about it.
[14:15.910 --> 14:19.770]  I am currently, we are, today is probably day 60.
[14:19.770 --> 14:22.390]  The day that I am recording is 60 days into flower
[14:22.390 --> 14:23.430]  on a breeding project.
[14:23.430 --> 14:26.530]  Those plants were hit with pollen around,
[14:26.530 --> 14:27.710]  it was around day 25.
[14:27.710 --> 14:28.550]  I've got it written down.
[14:28.550 --> 14:30.570]  I don't remember off the top of my hand.
[14:30.570 --> 14:32.330]  Approximately 25 days into flower,
[14:32.330 --> 14:34.550]  those plants received pollen.
[14:34.550 --> 14:36.930]  We are now 60 days in.
[14:36.930 --> 14:38.710]  Occasionally, every couple of days,
[14:38.710 --> 14:41.030]  I will go take one seed from a plant,
[14:41.030 --> 14:43.110]  just a random plant, not, I have a kind of a,
[14:43.110 --> 14:44.510]  there's a method to my madness,
[14:44.510 --> 14:47.070]  but I'll pick a plant and I will pull a seed
[14:47.070 --> 14:48.710]  from near the middle of the plant.
[14:48.710 --> 14:49.670]  There are a lot of bud sites.
[14:49.670 --> 14:50.510]  There are a lot of seeds in there.
[14:50.510 --> 14:52.790]  So pulling one seed off, I can see the seeds.
[14:52.790 --> 14:54.450]  They're swelling up in the buds.
[14:54.450 --> 14:56.310]  I will pull one off of there.
[14:56.310 --> 15:00.350]  A couple of days ago, I pulled one seed out of flow
[15:00.350 --> 15:02.110]  and the seed was hard.
[15:02.110 --> 15:03.750]  The outside was the right color.
[15:03.750 --> 15:05.670]  The outside was the right texture.
[15:05.670 --> 15:07.350]  I squeezed it and I could feel that it was
[15:07.350 --> 15:10.170]  a little bit soft, so it wasn't fully developed.
[15:10.170 --> 15:12.850]  It took my fingernail to crack the shell.
[15:12.850 --> 15:14.790]  I used my thumbnail and got through the shell
[15:14.790 --> 15:16.910]  and I could tell that the inside was very white
[15:16.910 --> 15:19.590]  and the seed was not quite done,
[15:19.590 --> 15:23.450]  but we are very few days away from those seeds being ready.
[15:23.450 --> 15:26.750]  So the breeding project is almost completed.
[15:26.750 --> 15:28.470]  I have stopped feeding nutrients.
[15:28.470 --> 15:30.030]  They're just getting clean water now.
[15:30.030 --> 15:31.850]  They'll just get clean water for the next few days
[15:31.850 --> 15:32.970]  until I do cut them down.
[15:32.970 --> 15:34.370]  There's not a lot of material there,
[15:34.370 --> 15:37.710]  but the leftover material will get turned into shatter
[15:37.710 --> 15:38.970]  so that we can smoke some dabs
[15:38.970 --> 15:41.910]  out of the stuff that is leftover.
[15:41.910 --> 15:44.790]  Pretty soon, there will be new seeds.
[15:44.790 --> 15:48.290]  So I'm guessing within the next five to 10 days,
[15:48.290 --> 15:49.690]  those plants will get cut down.
[15:49.690 --> 15:50.730]  I will cut them down.
[15:50.730 --> 15:51.730]  They'll hang upside down.
[15:51.730 --> 15:54.230]  I'll cut off all the large leaves very soon here.
[15:54.230 --> 15:55.070]  I'll cut them down.
[15:55.070 --> 15:56.250]  I'll hang them upside down.
[15:56.250 --> 15:58.250]  I'll let them get really dry.
[15:58.250 --> 16:01.030]  And then I will just lay them in
[16:01.030 --> 16:03.170]  kind of long Tupperware dishes is what they are.
[16:03.170 --> 16:04.650]  I cut them into little sections
[16:04.650 --> 16:05.890]  and lay them in Tupperware dishes
[16:05.890 --> 16:07.550]  and just let them get real dry.
[16:07.550 --> 16:08.890]  And then the buds start crumbling up
[16:08.890 --> 16:10.050]  and the seeds start falling out.
[16:10.050 --> 16:11.230]  And then when I have some spare time,
[16:11.230 --> 16:13.010]  I just sit there with some rubber gloves,
[16:13.010 --> 16:15.230]  like these black nitrile gloves,
[16:15.230 --> 16:17.090]  sit there with those on and just crunch up the buds.
[16:17.090 --> 16:18.410]  And you can hear the seeds fall out.
[16:18.410 --> 16:20.170]  Tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink, tink.
[16:20.170 --> 16:21.610]  And then just tip the container to one side
[16:21.610 --> 16:22.770]  and all the seeds roll to one end.
[16:22.770 --> 16:24.350]  All the bud material stays at the other.
[16:24.350 --> 16:27.050]  Take the seeds out, put them in a labeled jar,
[16:27.050 --> 16:28.770]  keep them all together.
[16:28.770 --> 16:31.450]  And then what will happen is I'll leave them open
[16:32.250 --> 16:33.530]  since they sat out for a long time,
[16:33.530 --> 16:34.570]  they'll probably be plenty dry.
[16:34.570 --> 16:36.770]  If there's any moisture in those seeds, I'll leave them open.
[16:36.770 --> 16:39.130]  But I'll seal them up and let them sit for a few days
[16:39.130 --> 16:40.810]  and think about who I want to give them to
[16:40.810 --> 16:42.450]  so that I can have some of my friends
[16:42.450 --> 16:44.370]  grow out some of my new stuff.
[16:44.370 --> 16:45.210]  That's what I like to do.
[16:45.210 --> 16:47.570]  I'll also grow a whole shit ton of it by myself.
[16:47.570 --> 16:49.210]  I always do that.
[16:49.210 --> 16:50.050]  It's a lot of fun.
[16:50.050 --> 16:52.330]  So coming up pretty soon in the room,
[16:53.250 --> 16:55.530]  the female plants were cookies and cream.
[16:55.530 --> 16:58.130]  There's white widow, there's a flow plant,
[16:58.130 --> 16:59.970]  there's some grateful dog.
[16:59.970 --> 17:01.970]  And there are a few arise plants in there
[17:01.970 --> 17:03.770]  so that we can make some arise F2s
[17:03.770 --> 17:05.710]  because those seeds are a lot of fun to grow.
[17:05.710 --> 17:08.450]  You guys, arise F2 has been showing some great,
[17:08.450 --> 17:09.690]  great phenotypes.
[17:09.690 --> 17:12.090]  I've been growing a few of those seeds out
[17:12.090 --> 17:14.050]  in little tiny pots and they look great.
[17:14.050 --> 17:15.770]  So that's kind of an update on the breeding project,
[17:15.770 --> 17:16.610]  you guys.
[17:16.610 --> 17:17.530]  It's nearly done.
[17:17.530 --> 17:19.010]  It's being flushed.
[17:19.010 --> 17:19.970]  Everything looks great.
[17:19.970 --> 17:21.050]  The seeds are getting hard.
[17:21.050 --> 17:22.610]  They're almost ready.
[17:22.610 --> 17:24.970]  Five to 10 days and I will be cutting them down
[17:24.970 --> 17:25.930]  and then they'll dry up.
[17:25.930 --> 17:27.450]  So another five to 10 days from there,
[17:27.450 --> 17:28.570]  I'll start pulling the seeds out.
[17:28.570 --> 17:29.970]  And then another five to 10 days from there,
[17:29.970 --> 17:32.010]  I'll start giving seeds out to my friends.
[17:32.010 --> 17:34.590]  Hopefully five to 10 days from there,
[17:34.590 --> 17:36.330]  people have shit germinated.
[17:36.330 --> 17:38.170]  And then hopefully 120 days from there,
[17:38.170 --> 17:40.290]  we've got pictures and flowers to smoke
[17:40.290 --> 17:41.650]  and all that kind of stuff
[17:41.650 --> 17:43.810]  so that we can see what the crop did.
[17:43.810 --> 17:46.450]  So that is my breeding update.
[17:46.450 --> 17:48.290]  The next thing I wanna do, you guys,
[17:48.290 --> 17:51.130]  once a month, I like to go and read these iTunes comments
[17:51.130 --> 17:52.650]  because if I let them go for more than a month,
[17:52.650 --> 17:54.730]  I seem to forget about them.
[17:54.730 --> 17:58.330]  In the month of December, I received two iTunes comments.
[17:59.130 --> 17:59.970]  So if you wanna go to iTunes,
[17:59.970 --> 18:02.370]  all you have to do is go to the iTunes store,
[18:02.370 --> 18:03.770]  go to the podcast tab,
[18:03.770 --> 18:05.610]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[18:05.610 --> 18:07.530]  Actually, you just go to iTunes.
[18:07.530 --> 18:09.250]  That says library, unplayed and store.
[18:09.250 --> 18:11.770]  Go to the store, search in Grow From Your Heart.
[18:11.770 --> 18:13.010]  Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[18:13.010 --> 18:14.210]  scroll down, it's a little icon.
[18:14.210 --> 18:15.050]  It's got my face on it.
[18:15.050 --> 18:16.250]  I'm sure you know what it looks like by now.
[18:16.250 --> 18:19.450]  Click on there, go to the ratings and review section.
[18:19.450 --> 18:22.530]  Then there is the option right here to give me some stars.
[18:22.530 --> 18:24.650]  You can give me as many stars as you feel I deserve.
[18:24.650 --> 18:26.330]  So far, ladies and gentlemen,
[18:26.330 --> 18:29.170]  41 people have given me a five-star review
[18:29.170 --> 18:32.610]  and 35 people have left a written review.
[18:32.610 --> 18:35.170]  We're gonna read the two most recent.
[18:35.170 --> 18:37.010]  This one comes from a person
[18:37.010 --> 18:39.610]  who called themselves JJOliveOil08.
[18:39.610 --> 18:41.370]  They left it on December 5th.
[18:41.370 --> 18:43.410]  And they said, Jeff is a very positive guy
[18:43.410 --> 18:46.210]  with so many informative things to say about growing
[18:46.210 --> 18:48.010]  and the rest of the industry.
[18:48.010 --> 18:49.330]  That's a great comment.
[18:49.330 --> 18:51.050]  I like hearing that I'm a positive guy
[18:51.050 --> 18:52.970]  and my goal is to be informative
[18:52.970 --> 18:54.850]  with shit to say about growing in the industry.
[18:54.850 --> 18:56.530]  So excellent, great review.
[18:56.530 --> 18:57.370]  I appreciate that.
[18:57.370 --> 19:00.010]  And of course, I got five stars.
[19:00.010 --> 19:00.850]  So I appreciate that.
[19:00.850 --> 19:01.690]  Thanks for the comment.
[19:01.690 --> 19:02.890]  Thanks for the five-star rating.
[19:02.890 --> 19:03.710]  I appreciate it.
[19:03.710 --> 19:05.050]  Keep listening.
[19:05.050 --> 19:06.690]  The next comment comes from a person
[19:06.690 --> 19:09.730]  that calls himself SamS37.
[19:09.730 --> 19:11.490]  They said, thanks, Ross to Jeff.
[19:11.490 --> 19:13.490]  I don't know where that weird they said accent came from,
[19:13.490 --> 19:14.330]  but that was new.
[19:14.330 --> 19:16.830]  They said, I've learned a ton from Jeff
[19:16.830 --> 19:17.810]  and the awesome guests.
[19:17.810 --> 19:19.650]  Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the community
[19:19.650 --> 19:22.110]  and helping make the world a better place.
[19:22.110 --> 19:24.530]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[19:25.210 --> 19:26.050]  I appreciate that.
[19:26.050 --> 19:27.450]  I'm glad you're learning from me and my guests.
[19:27.450 --> 19:28.290]  I appreciate that.
[19:28.290 --> 19:30.050]  That's my goal is to teach some people.
[19:30.050 --> 19:32.730]  I'm glad I'm able to share this knowledge with my community.
[19:32.730 --> 19:34.450]  That's what makes a community is sharing,
[19:34.450 --> 19:35.890]  bringing everybody together.
[19:35.890 --> 19:39.290]  And you're right, we are making the world a better place.
[19:39.290 --> 19:42.690]  We're making cannabis better, which makes people
[19:42.690 --> 19:44.710]  less grumpy and makes them less sick.
[19:44.710 --> 19:46.090]  It makes them happier.
[19:46.090 --> 19:48.710]  And the more people have cannabis, the better the world is.
[19:48.710 --> 19:49.930]  So I appreciate that.
[19:49.930 --> 19:51.930]  And I will keep fighting the good fight
[19:51.930 --> 19:53.170]  as long as I'm able to.
[19:53.170 --> 19:54.010]  I'll keep that up.
[19:54.490 --> 19:55.530]  That's what I'm here for.
[19:55.530 --> 19:56.370]  So I'm on it.
[19:56.370 --> 19:58.970]  Thanks for the review, Sam S37.
[19:58.970 --> 20:02.330]  You guys, I truly appreciate all of the iTunes reviews.
[20:02.330 --> 20:04.490]  You guys, 35 positive reviews.
[20:04.490 --> 20:06.050]  Nobody had some bad shit to talk.
[20:06.050 --> 20:06.870]  I appreciate that.
[20:06.870 --> 20:07.710]  I love you guys for that.
[20:07.710 --> 20:09.910]  And I've gotten 41 five-star ratings.
[20:09.910 --> 20:11.970]  Like I said, if you want to leave me a rating in a review,
[20:11.970 --> 20:13.570]  I would completely love it.
[20:13.570 --> 20:14.570]  If you've got something to say
[20:14.570 --> 20:16.650]  and you don't want to say it here on iTunes,
[20:16.650 --> 20:18.570]  or if you're not an iTunes user or listener,
[20:18.570 --> 20:19.650]  you can send me an email.
[20:19.650 --> 20:22.410]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:22.410 --> 20:25.930]  I would love to hear from you.
[20:25.930 --> 20:28.770]  All right, you guys, I want to give one shout out,
[20:28.770 --> 20:32.010]  which is going to lead into the main topic of this podcast.
[20:32.010 --> 20:33.370]  But before I do it,
[20:33.370 --> 20:35.010]  I feel like I've been talking for a long time
[20:35.010 --> 20:37.050]  and I'm also talking very quickly.
[20:37.050 --> 20:39.570]  So I'm going to press pause for one second.
[20:39.570 --> 20:40.970]  I'm going to take two dabs
[20:40.970 --> 20:42.010]  and then I'm going to take a drink
[20:42.010 --> 20:46.010]  of some tasty gingerade kombucha, and I'll be right back.
[20:46.010 --> 20:47.730]  You probably won't even notice I took a break
[20:47.730 --> 20:48.650]  because there's just going to be a little
[20:48.650 --> 20:51.090]  brrrah, brrrah, brrrah sound, and I'll be right back.
[20:51.170 --> 20:54.730]  See, I told you I'd be quick.
[20:54.730 --> 20:55.730]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[20:55.730 --> 20:57.330]  I'm heavily medicated now.
[20:57.330 --> 20:59.130]  I got some dabs of Cascade in my head.
[20:59.130 --> 21:02.570]  I just drank some frosty cold GTs.
[21:02.570 --> 21:04.290]  I got the gingerade kombucha.
[21:04.290 --> 21:06.010]  I love this stuff.
[21:06.010 --> 21:08.090]  Yeah, I do throw it away when I get to that bottom booger
[21:08.090 --> 21:10.170]  because I just can't handle that chunky shit at the bottom.
[21:10.170 --> 21:12.210]  So if you're going to talk shit, go for it.
[21:12.210 --> 21:14.710]  But I can't handle that shit, but this GTs is delicious.
[21:14.710 --> 21:17.650]  Anyway, there is a point to this podcast, you guys.
[21:17.650 --> 21:18.690]  I'm going to give a shout out
[21:18.690 --> 21:21.810]  and it will lead me into this point of the podcast.
[21:21.810 --> 21:22.970]  Sorry, I'm adjusting my headphones
[21:22.970 --> 21:24.930]  and getting my shit back together after that dab.
[21:24.930 --> 21:27.090]  My head is spinning a little bit.
[21:27.090 --> 21:30.750]  Apparently I say the word spliff kind of oddly.
[21:30.750 --> 21:34.410]  I don't do word well with the S-P-L sound for some reason.
[21:34.410 --> 21:37.050]  And then to end it with two Fs fucks me up a lot.
[21:37.050 --> 21:39.450]  Spliff, there's a podcast that I've been listening to
[21:39.450 --> 21:42.610]  called The Spliff Podcast.
[21:42.610 --> 21:46.130]  She spells it POTCAST, P-O-T-C-A-S-T.
[21:46.130 --> 21:47.990]  The Spliff Podcast is a great show.
[21:48.310 --> 21:50.710]  I've been listening to it for 50 something,
[21:50.710 --> 21:52.670]  probably 60 episodes now.
[21:52.670 --> 21:55.390]  I am completely caught up and it is a great show.
[21:55.390 --> 21:56.870]  I highly recommend it.
[21:56.870 --> 21:58.070]  Get it, I highly recommend it
[21:58.070 --> 21:59.950]  because I'm high and I'm recommending it.
[21:59.950 --> 22:01.590]  But seriously, if you like my podcast,
[22:01.590 --> 22:04.070]  you will enjoy The Spliff Podcast
[22:04.070 --> 22:06.870]  hosted by, I'm going to call her my new friend, Bo Nellis.
[22:06.870 --> 22:08.530]  I've been listening to her for 60 episodes.
[22:08.530 --> 22:10.430]  I feel like we are buddies now.
[22:10.430 --> 22:13.050]  We're just a dab away from being BFFs.
[22:13.050 --> 22:16.010]  So one of these days she's going to come to Colorado
[22:16.010 --> 22:16.910]  because I hate traveling.
[22:16.910 --> 22:17.750]  I don't travel well.
[22:18.510 --> 22:19.350]  She can come to me.
[22:19.350 --> 22:20.170]  She'll come to Colorado.
[22:20.170 --> 22:21.010]  We'll take some dabs together.
[22:21.010 --> 22:22.070]  Come on Bo, you're invited.
[22:22.070 --> 22:23.830]  Come hang out with Miss Jenny Beth and I.
[22:23.830 --> 22:25.470]  Got a spot for you at the dab table.
[22:25.470 --> 22:27.550]  Shit, we'll record a podcast together
[22:27.550 --> 22:29.610]  and we can both release it at the same time
[22:29.610 --> 22:30.910]  and we can just do a dual episode.
[22:30.910 --> 22:32.630]  Your audience can be introduced to me.
[22:32.630 --> 22:33.770]  I'll introduce you to my audience
[22:33.770 --> 22:35.070]  if they haven't already heard you
[22:35.070 --> 22:36.010]  and we'll get it going like that.
[22:36.010 --> 22:38.450]  But come take a dab with us, it'll be fun.
[22:38.450 --> 22:40.870]  So anyway, Bo does a lot of talk
[22:40.870 --> 22:44.610]  about very specific cannabinoid dosing
[22:44.610 --> 22:49.370]  and specific strains and very specific stuff
[22:49.370 --> 22:52.870]  for medicine for patients, which I appreciate.
[22:52.870 --> 22:54.830]  I completely respect it.
[22:54.830 --> 22:58.770]  However, sometimes I do not completely agree,
[22:58.770 --> 23:00.770]  although it's okay to disagree with each other.
[23:00.770 --> 23:01.850]  I'm not mad at you, Bo.
[23:01.850 --> 23:03.930]  I'm just saying sometimes I don't completely agree,
[23:03.930 --> 23:04.790]  which is cool.
[23:06.470 --> 23:09.590]  I think a lot of people are too focused on lab tests
[23:09.590 --> 23:13.130]  and they're not following their own body,
[23:13.130 --> 23:14.970]  their own intuition.
[23:14.970 --> 23:16.490]  Who's the dude, it was Toucan Sam.
[23:16.490 --> 23:20.450]  He used to say, follow your nose, it always knows.
[23:20.450 --> 23:23.290]  And when it comes to cannabis and selecting cannabis
[23:23.290 --> 23:27.030]  that will work for you, I personally believe
[23:27.030 --> 23:29.970]  that follow your nose because it always knows.
[23:29.970 --> 23:31.530]  The lab tests are great.
[23:31.530 --> 23:35.610]  However, I don't believe 50% of the lab tests that I see
[23:35.610 --> 23:38.570]  because I just saw a 34% THC test
[23:38.570 --> 23:40.090]  for a strain that I think is bullshit,
[23:40.090 --> 23:41.690]  but that's a whole nother story.
[23:43.370 --> 23:45.050]  Follow your nose over the lab test.
[23:45.050 --> 23:48.110]  I feel like strains that get your attention
[23:48.110 --> 23:50.670]  are probably good for you.
[23:50.670 --> 23:53.030]  Sometimes your body craves salt.
[23:53.030 --> 23:55.470]  You're probably needing salt or you're thirsty.
[23:55.470 --> 23:57.770]  Sometimes you'll be at the grocery store
[23:57.770 --> 23:59.330]  and you can look at the fruit
[23:59.330 --> 24:02.330]  and you can see seven different kinds of delicious fruit,
[24:02.330 --> 24:05.610]  but one of them calls your name, or maybe it's a vegetable.
[24:05.610 --> 24:07.830]  Something calls your name and it just jumps out
[24:07.830 --> 24:10.890]  and you're like, oh, I want to eat some of that.
[24:10.890 --> 24:13.010]  I feel like your body is programmed
[24:13.010 --> 24:16.110]  to let you know what you want and what you need.
[24:16.110 --> 24:17.810]  And it makes you think, when you're thirsty,
[24:17.810 --> 24:19.050]  your body goes, I'm thirsty.
[24:19.050 --> 24:22.770]  And you recognize that because you're lacking water.
[24:22.770 --> 24:24.970]  Maybe if you need some vitamin C
[24:24.970 --> 24:26.250]  and you're walking through the grocery store,
[24:26.250 --> 24:27.850]  you're gonna see oranges and your eyes are gonna go,
[24:27.850 --> 24:29.150]  that's the thing right there.
[24:29.150 --> 24:30.530]  And you're gonna grab it.
[24:30.530 --> 24:32.730]  That's also why I think poop stinks
[24:32.730 --> 24:34.630]  because you're not supposed to eat poop.
[24:34.630 --> 24:39.250]  So whatever you believe in, nature, Jah, God,
[24:39.250 --> 24:42.390]  whoever created us made it perfect.
[24:42.390 --> 24:44.250]  Our poop stinks, we don't want to eat it.
[24:44.250 --> 24:46.730]  And we desire the stuff that our body needs
[24:46.730 --> 24:48.090]  because we're supposed to do that.
[24:48.090 --> 24:49.290]  That's why cannabis smells good,
[24:49.290 --> 24:52.050]  because we're supposed to be consuming it, in my opinion.
[24:52.050 --> 24:54.290]  Also to support my statement,
[24:54.290 --> 24:57.610]  I think physically people who are related
[24:57.610 --> 24:59.890]  don't find each other's pheromones attractive
[24:59.890 --> 25:01.730]  because we're not supposed to be mating.
[25:01.730 --> 25:04.730]  If you're too close in bloodline together,
[25:04.730 --> 25:08.310]  if you're family, you probably won't be turned on
[25:08.350 --> 25:11.150]  by somebody's scent, which sounds weird,
[25:11.150 --> 25:13.990]  but we are attracted to pheromones.
[25:13.990 --> 25:16.510]  And sometimes you'll smell somebody of the opposite sex
[25:16.510 --> 25:18.590]  and you will want to get closer to them.
[25:18.590 --> 25:20.450]  If they're too close to you,
[25:20.450 --> 25:22.090]  you're genetically programmed
[25:22.090 --> 25:23.830]  to not find their smell attractive
[25:23.830 --> 25:26.210]  so that you don't hit on your cousin,
[25:26.210 --> 25:27.330]  is what I'm getting at.
[25:27.330 --> 25:28.950]  So I think our bodies know.
[25:28.950 --> 25:30.110]  Our bodies give us signals.
[25:30.110 --> 25:31.910]  And what I'm really getting at
[25:31.910 --> 25:33.230]  is I think that the medicine,
[25:33.230 --> 25:34.550]  the cannabis that calls at you
[25:34.550 --> 25:36.310]  has probably got something in it
[25:36.310 --> 25:38.210]  that you need to be consuming
[25:38.210 --> 25:40.110]  or that is going to work well for you.
[25:40.110 --> 25:41.910]  That's why it smells so good.
[25:41.910 --> 25:43.390]  Part of what makes me think this,
[25:43.390 --> 25:46.350]  we were, I've been helping out in a large commercial grow.
[25:46.350 --> 25:47.630]  You guys, I bounce around from grow to grow,
[25:47.630 --> 25:49.070]  but I've been in another grow.
[25:49.070 --> 25:51.830]  And my friend James is constantly walking
[25:51.830 --> 25:54.030]  to two very specific plants.
[25:54.030 --> 25:55.230]  James is from the South.
[25:55.230 --> 25:58.210]  We've got a strain called Recon in one of the grows.
[25:58.210 --> 26:01.590]  And since James is from the South, he calls it Reckon.
[26:01.590 --> 26:03.110]  We just let James call it Reckon
[26:03.110 --> 26:04.510]  because, I mean, he's James.
[26:04.510 --> 26:06.730]  What are we going to do for the old Southern boy?
[26:06.730 --> 26:09.990]  But Reckon always gets his attention.
[26:09.990 --> 26:11.630]  He loves the way Reckon smells.
[26:11.630 --> 26:14.990]  He always, there are four rooms in this facility
[26:14.990 --> 26:16.790]  and they're all in different stages of flower.
[26:16.790 --> 26:19.190]  And if you put James in there and you go walk to a plant,
[26:19.190 --> 26:21.270]  you'll always watch him walk over to the Recon
[26:21.270 --> 26:23.550]  and just give it a smell and stand by it.
[26:23.550 --> 26:25.050]  There's also another strain in there.
[26:25.050 --> 26:25.890]  Which one is it?
[26:25.890 --> 26:26.710]  It's called Banana Split.
[26:26.710 --> 26:28.230]  It grows these big purple buds.
[26:28.230 --> 26:30.290]  It's gorgeous, but it's got a smell
[26:30.290 --> 26:32.630]  that James can't stay away from.
[26:32.630 --> 26:35.470]  If you put him in the room to defoliate or do work,
[26:35.470 --> 26:37.670]  he always ends up working on a Reckon
[26:37.670 --> 26:40.330]  or a Banana Split plant because they call him.
[26:40.330 --> 26:43.650]  So I think there's something in there that James needs.
[26:43.650 --> 26:47.310]  Like either recreational, medicinally.
[26:47.310 --> 26:49.850]  I don't even know what it is, but it's calling him.
[26:49.850 --> 26:52.570]  I feel like there's something in that plant that James needs.
[26:52.570 --> 26:54.170]  If James is going to consume cannabis,
[26:54.170 --> 26:56.910]  it should be one of those strains that calls his name.
[26:56.910 --> 27:00.170]  That's probably going to be, he might not be sick,
[27:00.170 --> 27:02.270]  but that's going to be the one that is the most healing
[27:02.910 --> 27:03.970]  and the most therapeutic for him.
[27:03.970 --> 27:06.330]  I would highly recommend that he tries some of that stuff
[27:06.330 --> 27:08.610]  when it's ready and see what goes on.
[27:08.610 --> 27:10.790]  I've got some more things that I can support my statement
[27:10.790 --> 27:14.130]  that our nose indicates which cannabis is best for us.
[27:14.130 --> 27:17.090]  With my own experience, if you know anything about me,
[27:17.090 --> 27:19.010]  if you pay attention to my breeding projects,
[27:19.010 --> 27:21.770]  a lot of my breeding leans toward
[27:21.770 --> 27:25.670]  the lemony flavored sativa dominant hybrids.
[27:25.670 --> 27:29.570]  I like high THC content and I like a really lemony flavor.
[27:29.570 --> 27:31.570]  I enjoy a citrusy flavor.
[27:31.590 --> 27:33.390]  Something I've noticed when I smoke stuff
[27:33.390 --> 27:38.390]  with an orange flavor, tangerine haze, tangy,
[27:38.670 --> 27:42.550]  the orange creamsicle, orange dreamsicle, agent orange,
[27:42.550 --> 27:45.050]  anything with that orange terp to it,
[27:45.050 --> 27:48.350]  it's a very mellow yet uplifting sort of good mood,
[27:48.350 --> 27:49.710]  good vibe sort of a thing.
[27:49.710 --> 27:53.070]  The oranges is always like an anxiety free,
[27:53.070 --> 27:54.710]  mellow, chilled out.
[27:54.710 --> 27:56.870]  I call it kind of a breakfast high.
[27:56.870 --> 27:58.430]  It's for when you're doing,
[27:58.430 --> 28:00.110]  I like to handle my business in the morning.
[28:00.770 --> 28:02.810]  I do my emails, I do my phone calls.
[28:02.810 --> 28:05.090]  Any stuff that's gonna require a lot of clarity,
[28:05.090 --> 28:07.650]  I try to get it done before I end up
[28:07.650 --> 28:09.250]  taking my lunchtime dabs
[28:09.250 --> 28:12.010]  because at lunchtime we get down for some dabs.
[28:12.010 --> 28:13.690]  So I try to get, if I'm gonna smoke in the morning,
[28:13.690 --> 28:15.330]  I like to have something a little lighter
[28:15.330 --> 28:16.150]  if that's available.
[28:16.150 --> 28:18.450]  So Jilly Bean is a great breakfast dab.
[28:18.450 --> 28:21.410]  I don't wanna smoke something like Jack Harer
[28:21.410 --> 28:23.890]  or Jack the Ripper first thing in the morning.
[28:23.890 --> 28:26.050]  That's gonna just kind of fuck up my whole flow.
[28:26.050 --> 28:27.970]  I'm gonna be off kilter all day.
[28:27.970 --> 28:30.050]  I may be a little anxious because when you get that high
[28:30.990 --> 28:32.390]  in the morning, I feel like I fuck stuff up.
[28:32.390 --> 28:34.870]  I'll leave something at home or I'll leave something on
[28:34.870 --> 28:36.510]  and leave and go all the way to work.
[28:36.510 --> 28:38.710]  Or you'll do that thing where you put the gas pump
[28:38.710 --> 28:40.690]  in the car and drive away with the pump in the car.
[28:40.690 --> 28:42.430]  I've never done that, but that's the kind of shit
[28:42.430 --> 28:44.070]  I feel like I could do if I smoke too strong
[28:44.070 --> 28:45.750]  of a sativa in the morning.
[28:45.750 --> 28:47.630]  I gotta get my head on straight.
[28:47.630 --> 28:50.230]  So I like to start off with that, that orangey terp.
[28:50.230 --> 28:51.070]  That's where I was.
[28:51.070 --> 28:52.950]  I know I just talked myself back to where I was
[28:52.950 --> 28:54.150]  because I fucking lost track of where I was,
[28:54.150 --> 28:55.990]  but I found it, you guys, so you can't make fun of me.
[28:55.990 --> 28:58.070]  But those orangey terps are always like mellow
[28:58.070 --> 28:59.310]  and uplifting and a smile.
[28:59.330 --> 29:01.810]  They always make me kind of smile, put me in a good mood.
[29:01.810 --> 29:04.010]  That's always what I've noticed from orangey terps.
[29:04.010 --> 29:07.810]  Lemon terps, it makes my head spin
[29:07.810 --> 29:10.330]  and it makes me motivated and it makes me talkative.
[29:10.330 --> 29:12.890]  Before I do these podcasts, I like to smoke
[29:12.890 --> 29:17.410]  heavy sativa dominant lemon flavored dabs.
[29:17.410 --> 29:18.250]  They get right to my head.
[29:18.250 --> 29:20.930]  Today I'm smoking Cascade, which is bred by me.
[29:20.930 --> 29:24.050]  This is a lemon skunk female that was pollinated
[29:24.050 --> 29:27.090]  by a Daybreaker male and I am using phenotype,
[29:27.090 --> 29:28.770]  which was known as B1.
[29:29.270 --> 29:31.710]  It's the really lemony, it smells like dish soap,
[29:31.710 --> 29:35.030]  honestly, you guys, this is why I named it Cascade.
[29:35.030 --> 29:37.750]  Cascade, the feeling of something coming over you,
[29:37.750 --> 29:40.150]  like the waterfall of this feeling that happens
[29:40.150 --> 29:42.150]  when you dab it, it's the Cascade.
[29:42.150 --> 29:44.310]  And then it also smells like lemon dish soap,
[29:44.310 --> 29:47.290]  which is Cascade, so I called it Cascade.
[29:47.290 --> 29:49.470]  You can tell, it makes me talkative and rambly.
[29:49.470 --> 29:51.350]  It's my version of AlphaBrain.
[29:51.350 --> 29:54.670]  Joe Rogan takes 17 AlphaBrain before a podcast.
[29:54.670 --> 29:56.670]  I smoke six dabs of Cascade.
[29:56.690 --> 29:59.490]  So I really feel like these lemon terps
[29:59.490 --> 30:00.890]  keep me in a good mood.
[30:00.890 --> 30:03.690]  I do battle some, my brain is mad at me.
[30:03.690 --> 30:05.770]  You guys, I hit my head a long time ago
[30:05.770 --> 30:07.090]  and my mood swings a little bit.
[30:07.090 --> 30:09.050]  I'll get pissy sometimes.
[30:09.050 --> 30:11.790]  Take a few Cascade dabs, I forget what I was mad about.
[30:11.790 --> 30:13.850]  So I feel like the high sativa, the lemon terps
[30:13.850 --> 30:15.950]  work well for my body type.
[30:15.950 --> 30:17.370]  Another thing that I'm going to say
[30:17.370 --> 30:21.970]  that supports my statement, this may sound racist,
[30:21.970 --> 30:25.890]  but it's not racist, this is a geographical thing
[30:25.910 --> 30:27.430]  that I feel like I have discovered.
[30:27.430 --> 30:30.370]  Where I live, we have a high population
[30:30.370 --> 30:32.710]  of Mexican and Hispanic heritage people.
[30:32.710 --> 30:35.110]  A lot of people here have people,
[30:35.110 --> 30:37.150]  bloodlines straight to Mexico.
[30:38.190 --> 30:41.030]  One of the most popular strains to ever come around,
[30:41.030 --> 30:43.190]  where I live, you guys, I live in Pueblo, Colorado.
[30:43.190 --> 30:45.030]  This is Southern Colorado.
[30:45.030 --> 30:48.350]  Very, very heavily Mexican populated.
[30:48.350 --> 30:50.710]  A long time ago, we got some sour diesel here
[30:50.710 --> 30:52.790]  and it has not gone away since then
[30:52.790 --> 30:56.530]  because the Mexican people here love sour diesel.
[30:56.530 --> 30:59.150]  If you smell that sour diesel smell down the block,
[30:59.150 --> 31:03.890]  if you burn some sour diesel, a Mexican heritage person
[31:03.890 --> 31:05.910]  will ask you for some sour diesel.
[31:05.910 --> 31:08.890]  You guys, in 2017, I don't fucking know
[31:08.890 --> 31:11.090]  if it's racist to call somebody a Mexican.
[31:11.090 --> 31:12.690]  I think people that have, that were,
[31:12.690 --> 31:14.570]  their families from Mexico and they got Mexican blood
[31:14.570 --> 31:16.530]  in them, that is a Mexican person to me.
[31:16.530 --> 31:18.050]  I'm not trying to be racist, I don't know the other word.
[31:18.050 --> 31:19.370]  If there's a better word I should be using,
[31:19.370 --> 31:20.690]  fucking tell me, I'll use it.
[31:20.690 --> 31:22.050]  Also, I need to make a correction.
[31:22.070 --> 31:24.510]  Earlier I said, pheromones of somebody
[31:24.510 --> 31:26.470]  from the opposite sex could get your attention.
[31:26.470 --> 31:28.390]  It's also 2017.
[31:28.390 --> 31:30.510]  Pheromones from fucking anybody could get your attention.
[31:30.510 --> 31:32.670]  Now, I apologize if that was offensive as well.
[31:32.670 --> 31:35.690]  I'm gonna try to be more sensitive to that sort of thing
[31:35.690 --> 31:39.350]  without overdoing it, but it could be the same sex.
[31:39.350 --> 31:41.750]  Go for it, it's 2017.
[31:41.750 --> 31:43.630]  I'm trying not to be racist with the Mexican word.
[31:43.630 --> 31:46.470]  So, I've noticed that the Mexican people around here
[31:46.470 --> 31:48.270]  love to smoke sour diesel.
[31:48.270 --> 31:50.430]  My theory, I could be wrong here.
[31:50.450 --> 31:51.850]  This is Rasta Jeff's theory.
[31:51.850 --> 31:54.430]  Once again, I'm not a scientist, I'm not a doctor.
[31:54.430 --> 31:56.790]  I've just been doing this for a minute.
[31:56.790 --> 31:58.810]  The Mexican people here love sour diesel
[31:58.810 --> 32:00.770]  almost more than any other strain.
[32:00.770 --> 32:05.250]  I feel like Mexican, that sour diesel is a chem dog
[32:05.250 --> 32:07.610]  crossed to a Mexican sativa.
[32:07.610 --> 32:08.550]  That's what I feel like.
[32:08.550 --> 32:13.550]  Or there is a heavy Mexican sativa genetic in the cannabis.
[32:14.170 --> 32:16.410]  I feel like that Mexican sativa is what causes
[32:16.410 --> 32:20.250]  that skunky smell, that real skunk, funk, pungent odor
[32:21.090 --> 32:23.070]  that almost tends to lean to the diesel.
[32:24.230 --> 32:26.390]  I think that is a Mexican sativa.
[32:26.390 --> 32:30.110]  And I think that since that Mexican sativa plant
[32:30.110 --> 32:32.590]  and the Mexican people come from the same spot
[32:32.590 --> 32:36.750]  on the planet, they are getting a stronger benefit
[32:36.750 --> 32:38.750]  and a stronger desire for that plant
[32:38.750 --> 32:42.070]  because it's geographically from where they're from
[32:42.070 --> 32:45.070]  in their body, their history, they know that.
[32:45.070 --> 32:47.570]  And something about where they are,
[32:47.570 --> 32:49.310]  something in that sour diesel plant
[32:49.330 --> 32:52.770]  is going to benefit their life because of their environment.
[32:53.930 --> 32:55.570]  It's just something in their body chemistry.
[32:55.570 --> 32:56.930]  It's something in their genetics.
[32:56.930 --> 32:59.410]  It's something that's pre-programmed in their memory.
[32:59.410 --> 33:02.410]  I don't know how to back it up with science or anything.
[33:02.410 --> 33:04.530]  This is just my opinion and my theory.
[33:04.530 --> 33:08.370]  So my whole point here is that I feel like your body,
[33:08.370 --> 33:12.210]  your nose, your mouth, your senses are probably
[33:12.210 --> 33:16.430]  the best judge of what cannabis is best for you.
[33:16.430 --> 33:18.610]  I do respect the lab tests.
[33:18.630 --> 33:22.390]  I completely appreciate the idea of a lab test,
[33:22.390 --> 33:27.310]  but please do not let that lab test ruin your idea
[33:27.310 --> 33:28.250]  of a certain strain.
[33:28.250 --> 33:29.830]  If a strain gets your attention,
[33:29.830 --> 33:32.230]  okay, if you have two strains sitting next to each other
[33:32.230 --> 33:34.210]  and you have a lab test for both of them
[33:34.210 --> 33:35.430]  and you can smell both of them,
[33:35.430 --> 33:38.510]  if one has great lab tests and one smells better,
[33:38.510 --> 33:39.550]  get the one that smells better.
[33:39.550 --> 33:41.590]  If it's properly trimmed and cured and grown properly,
[33:41.590 --> 33:43.630]  if they're both top shelf buds,
[33:43.630 --> 33:45.130]  get the one that smells better.
[33:45.130 --> 33:46.110]  I can almost guarantee you,
[33:46.110 --> 33:48.270]  you're going to have more pleasure from it.
[33:48.930 --> 33:51.210]  Also something I want to add to this 30 minute rant
[33:51.210 --> 33:53.490]  about selecting your cannabis strains via your nose
[33:53.490 --> 33:54.770]  instead of your lab test,
[33:55.730 --> 33:59.030]  don't discredit a strain because you've tried it once
[33:59.030 --> 34:00.490]  from one grower.
[34:00.490 --> 34:03.170]  I hear people say, oh, I hate whatever strain.
[34:03.170 --> 34:04.770]  I don't like this strain.
[34:04.770 --> 34:06.610]  This strain is fire.
[34:06.610 --> 34:09.730]  You guys, the quality of a flower you purchase
[34:09.730 --> 34:14.730]  can vary widely on the same strain for very many reasons.
[34:15.290 --> 34:17.170]  I'm sorry, I'm trying to get this all through my brain
[34:17.170 --> 34:18.110]  and to you clearly.
[34:18.950 --> 34:20.010]  I don't have any notes on this part.
[34:21.150 --> 34:25.010]  If I grow some flowers and Jessie grows some flowers
[34:25.010 --> 34:26.850]  and my girl Jenny grows some flowers,
[34:26.850 --> 34:28.790]  they're all three going to come out different.
[34:28.790 --> 34:32.170]  I grow with botanic care nutrients indoors.
[34:32.170 --> 34:34.610]  Jessie grows with organic nutrients
[34:34.610 --> 34:36.650]  in a light depth greenhouse.
[34:36.650 --> 34:37.890]  Jenny doesn't grow.
[34:37.890 --> 34:39.010]  That's hypothetical.
[34:39.010 --> 34:41.850]  We're going to say she grows in a tent with synthetic newts.
[34:41.850 --> 34:43.910]  All of our stuff is going to come out different.
[34:43.910 --> 34:46.050]  We may have a clone of the same thing.
[34:46.050 --> 34:48.350]  It's going to come out a little bit different.
[34:48.350 --> 34:49.790]  The lab testing will be different.
[34:49.790 --> 34:51.030]  The flavors will be different.
[34:51.030 --> 34:52.630]  The terpene profile will be different.
[34:52.630 --> 34:55.350]  The cannabinoid profile will be a little bit different.
[34:55.350 --> 34:56.990]  It's going to come out differently
[34:56.990 --> 34:59.070]  because of the different environments.
[34:59.070 --> 35:01.590]  There'll be different phenotypical expressions,
[35:01.590 --> 35:03.670]  which also leads me to something else.
[35:03.670 --> 35:05.390]  Maybe you got a shitty,
[35:05.390 --> 35:07.950]  maybe somebody selected a shitty phenotype
[35:07.950 --> 35:09.230]  of that strain for you.
[35:09.230 --> 35:11.070]  Maybe they got a 10 pack of seeds
[35:11.070 --> 35:13.430]  and they chose the one that grows short and stout
[35:13.430 --> 35:15.270]  and you would have preferred the one that grows
[35:15.290 --> 35:17.770]  tall and skinny, but that's not what they wanted.
[35:17.770 --> 35:20.930]  So you didn't get a good representation of that plant.
[35:20.930 --> 35:22.850]  So don't discredit something
[35:22.850 --> 35:25.670]  just because you didn't like it the first time.
[35:25.670 --> 35:27.130]  If Jenny grew it, it's different.
[35:27.130 --> 35:28.610]  If Jessie grew it, it's different.
[35:28.610 --> 35:29.730]  If I grew it, it's different.
[35:29.730 --> 35:31.210]  You may like Jenny's style better.
[35:31.210 --> 35:32.450]  You may like Jessie's better.
[35:32.450 --> 35:33.850]  You may like mine better.
[35:33.850 --> 35:34.970]  And you just got to find,
[35:34.970 --> 35:36.410]  give a strain a couple of tries.
[35:36.410 --> 35:38.170]  If it gives you a headache or a panic attack
[35:38.170 --> 35:40.450]  or something like that, I could see why you'd avoid it.
[35:40.450 --> 35:41.770]  Maybe not go for it a second try,
[35:41.770 --> 35:44.470]  but if you just didn't like it for some weird reason,
[35:44.470 --> 35:45.310]  give it another shot.
[35:45.310 --> 35:49.310]  You may be discrediting yourself on something weird.
[35:49.310 --> 35:50.150]  All right, you guys.
[35:50.150 --> 35:52.350]  So focus more on the effects of the cannabis,
[35:52.350 --> 35:54.110]  how much it draws you.
[35:54.110 --> 35:55.070]  The lab tests are great.
[35:55.070 --> 35:56.730]  What I really like a lab test for
[35:56.730 --> 35:59.470]  is now they are showing pesticides and stuff like that.
[35:59.470 --> 36:00.390]  That's what I like to see.
[36:00.390 --> 36:02.750]  In my concentrates, I can see how many
[36:02.750 --> 36:05.070]  residual solvents are in my dabs.
[36:05.070 --> 36:07.630]  I can see how much pesticide is in my dabs.
[36:07.630 --> 36:09.830]  I like being able to see that kind of stuff.
[36:09.830 --> 36:13.070]  I really like seeing it when things test really high.
[36:13.070 --> 36:14.990]  Sometimes it's questionable.
[36:14.990 --> 36:16.670]  We're gonna talk in the future
[36:16.670 --> 36:18.390]  about actual lab test numbers
[36:18.390 --> 36:20.750]  because people see THC and THCA
[36:20.750 --> 36:23.350]  and they're not sure which ones to brag about on the testing.
[36:23.350 --> 36:26.950]  We're gonna talk about that a little bit in the future.
[36:26.950 --> 36:28.150]  One more note that I added to this
[36:28.150 --> 36:29.670]  that I wanna make sure I cover
[36:29.670 --> 36:33.750]  before I move on from the lab test versus your senses
[36:33.750 --> 36:36.390]  is that the labs are all calibrated the same.
[36:36.390 --> 36:39.550]  All of those machines have the same base
[36:39.550 --> 36:40.910]  and the same, I don't know what,
[36:40.910 --> 36:42.270]  the same standard is what it's called.
[36:42.270 --> 36:44.230]  They ran the same THC through that machine
[36:44.230 --> 36:46.230]  to set a standard for all of them.
[36:46.230 --> 36:47.750]  So they're all calibrated.
[36:47.750 --> 36:51.070]  Our bodies are not calibrated the exact same.
[36:51.070 --> 36:52.350]  So there will be differences.
[36:52.350 --> 36:55.310]  Our body chemistry is going to play a huge role
[36:55.310 --> 36:56.550]  in what cannabis works for you.
[36:56.550 --> 36:59.590]  So the lab tests are great, but your body chemistry,
[36:59.590 --> 37:01.630]  your nose, your eyes, your mouth,
[37:01.630 --> 37:03.070]  hopefully your ears aren't involved too much
[37:03.070 --> 37:04.070]  in selecting your cannabis
[37:04.070 --> 37:06.130]  unless you heard of a killer strain.
[37:06.130 --> 37:08.950]  But how you feel, all of that stuff
[37:08.950 --> 37:12.190]  should be a huge decision maker for your cannabis.
[37:13.110 --> 37:14.150]  Trust in the tests, read all those tests,
[37:14.150 --> 37:16.110]  find out what kind of pesticides are in there.
[37:16.110 --> 37:17.670]  And then maybe here's a good tip.
[37:17.670 --> 37:20.550]  If you find some strains that you like
[37:20.550 --> 37:22.450]  and you can find lab testing on all of them
[37:22.450 --> 37:25.790]  that is slightly consistent, find what is common.
[37:25.790 --> 37:28.230]  Find the common thread through those tests
[37:28.230 --> 37:29.690]  and then maybe you can start looking
[37:29.690 --> 37:31.950]  for more strains like that.
[37:31.950 --> 37:34.990]  And in the future, I believe that we're going to have
[37:34.990 --> 37:38.310]  tailor-made cannabis dosing.
[37:38.350 --> 37:41.990]  You'll be able to go get a tailor-made,
[37:41.990 --> 37:44.670]  perfectly, the perfect amount of terps,
[37:44.670 --> 37:46.390]  the perfect amount of cannabinoids,
[37:46.390 --> 37:48.070]  the right amount of each cannabinoid,
[37:48.070 --> 37:49.910]  however you want it, whatever ratios you want,
[37:49.910 --> 37:52.230]  you'll be able to get a pill probably made for yourself
[37:52.230 --> 37:55.670]  that you can swallow and it is your perfect cannabis medicine
[37:55.670 --> 37:58.310]  so start looking now at those lab tests,
[37:58.310 --> 37:59.670]  find the little chart that works for you,
[37:59.670 --> 38:01.110]  find all those common threads
[38:01.110 --> 38:03.750]  and you'll be ahead of the game when that time comes.
[38:03.750 --> 38:05.070]  Okay, just a few seconds ago,
[38:05.070 --> 38:07.250]  I was talking about strains that give me panic attacks
[38:07.250 --> 38:08.970]  in the morning and strains that I like to smoke
[38:08.970 --> 38:10.530]  at certain times of the day.
[38:10.530 --> 38:12.330]  When I was outlining this episode,
[38:12.330 --> 38:16.810]  I decided to make a short list of strains that work well.
[38:16.810 --> 38:18.950]  I call them low panic strains.
[38:18.950 --> 38:22.450]  I've got Jilly Bean written down as a low panic strain,
[38:22.450 --> 38:26.790]  you guys, Tangerine Haze is a low panic strain,
[38:26.790 --> 38:29.290]  Tangy is a low panic strain.
[38:29.290 --> 38:31.690]  In my opinion, these are things in my opinion
[38:31.690 --> 38:33.970]  that do not cause panic and anxiety.
[38:33.970 --> 38:36.130]  Those are sativa kind of strains
[38:36.130 --> 38:38.050]  that put a smile on my face
[38:38.050 --> 38:40.130]  and put a little pep in my step.
[38:40.130 --> 38:42.850]  If you gotta do dishes, if you have to vacuum the house,
[38:42.850 --> 38:44.850]  these are the perfect strains for that.
[38:44.850 --> 38:48.050]  They keep you moving and they don't seem to mess up my focus
[38:48.050 --> 38:49.650]  and ruin my plans for the day.
[38:49.650 --> 38:51.830]  Sometimes if I smoke something too sativa heavy
[38:51.830 --> 38:53.610]  first thing in the morning, like I said,
[38:53.610 --> 38:55.370]  a big fat joint of lemon Jeffrey
[38:55.370 --> 38:56.250]  first thing in the morning,
[38:56.250 --> 38:58.030]  I might not get the right things done.
[38:58.030 --> 38:58.890]  I'll get some shit done,
[38:58.890 --> 39:02.250]  but it will not be what was on the to-do list at all.
[39:02.250 --> 39:04.650]  Something will get cleaned that did not need to be cleaned,
[39:04.650 --> 39:06.250]  stuff like that will happen.
[39:06.250 --> 39:07.690]  So stuff with the orange turps,
[39:07.690 --> 39:09.970]  I think are great for the morning.
[39:09.970 --> 39:12.210]  Things to avoid if you get panicky,
[39:12.210 --> 39:15.690]  strains I would stay away from, Jack the Ripper,
[39:15.690 --> 39:17.450]  way too sativa dominant for your head
[39:17.450 --> 39:18.650]  first thing in the morning.
[39:18.650 --> 39:22.050]  Vortex, Space Queen, way too much for your head
[39:22.050 --> 39:23.250]  first thing in the morning.
[39:23.250 --> 39:25.730]  Sour Diesel, way too much for most people
[39:25.730 --> 39:26.570]  first thing in the morning.
[39:26.570 --> 39:29.290]  So if you get panicky, stay away from the Sour Diesel,
[39:29.290 --> 39:32.350]  the Vortex, the Jack the Ripper, the Space Queen,
[39:32.390 --> 39:34.350]  stay away from that sort of stuff.
[39:35.370 --> 39:37.110]  If you want the giggles,
[39:37.110 --> 39:40.050]  something that is often given a lot of people the giggles
[39:40.050 --> 39:41.590]  is the LA Confidential.
[39:41.590 --> 39:44.670]  If you can find a really Indica dominant LA Confidential,
[39:44.670 --> 39:47.070]  smoke on that and get the giggles.
[39:47.070 --> 39:50.830]  I smoked some CBN Shatter a few days ago
[39:50.830 --> 39:52.830]  with a couple friends of mine.
[39:52.830 --> 39:56.830]  If you can find products that are high in CBN,
[39:56.830 --> 39:58.150]  you will get the munchies.
[39:58.150 --> 39:59.590]  I wanted to, I took that dab
[39:59.590 --> 40:01.330]  and by the time I was done blowing the dab out,
[40:01.330 --> 40:03.610]  I wanted to eat the rig and the dabber.
[40:03.610 --> 40:05.090]  I wanted to eat everything in sight.
[40:05.090 --> 40:07.370]  So CBN is good if you're trying to get hungry.
[40:07.370 --> 40:08.210]  I'm just trying to think of things
[40:08.210 --> 40:09.970]  that'll help you guys out for specific strains
[40:09.970 --> 40:11.290]  and stuff you guys.
[40:11.290 --> 40:14.030]  If you're looking for very specific CBD strains,
[40:14.030 --> 40:17.930]  I can recommend Torobora, ACDC and Pennywise.
[40:17.930 --> 40:20.750]  A lot of people are looking for CBD dominant strains
[40:20.750 --> 40:21.590]  right now.
[40:21.590 --> 40:24.050]  Something that I like to talk about is the Night Nurse
[40:24.050 --> 40:26.290]  and I also like Kings Cure.
[40:26.290 --> 40:27.990]  Kings Cure is available in seed form.
[40:27.990 --> 40:29.810]  Night Nurse is sold out.
[40:29.810 --> 40:31.210]  You might be able to find Kings Cure
[40:32.090 --> 40:33.170]  in a few places.
[40:33.170 --> 40:34.210]  Grab those if you can.
[40:34.210 --> 40:37.570]  There are some great CBD phenotypes in there.
[40:37.570 --> 40:38.410]  One thing I should mention,
[40:38.410 --> 40:39.930]  if people are thinking about starting
[40:39.930 --> 40:41.970]  to use medical marijuana,
[40:41.970 --> 40:43.970]  first of all, start very slowly.
[40:43.970 --> 40:45.210]  If you're going to smoke,
[40:45.210 --> 40:48.010]  I suggest starting off with flowers.
[40:48.010 --> 40:50.890]  Start off with a pipe with some flowers in it
[40:50.890 --> 40:55.090]  or a joint and take one or two medium size puffs
[40:55.090 --> 40:56.530]  or draws or inhalations.
[40:56.530 --> 40:57.690]  Don't smoke, don't pull it in
[40:57.690 --> 40:59.530]  until you feel like your lungs are swelling up.
[40:59.530 --> 41:00.890]  Just get enough smoke in there.
[41:01.570 --> 41:02.890]  Blow it out, do that once or twice.
[41:02.890 --> 41:05.170]  You're gonna feel it very quickly.
[41:05.170 --> 41:06.010]  You're not gonna freak out.
[41:06.010 --> 41:06.830]  You'll be just fine.
[41:06.830 --> 41:08.090]  Nobody's ever died from cannabis.
[41:08.090 --> 41:09.250]  You're gonna be okay.
[41:09.250 --> 41:10.890]  If you're really scared that you're gonna have
[41:10.890 --> 41:13.730]  a shitty high and you're worried about it,
[41:13.730 --> 41:15.330]  make yourself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[41:15.330 --> 41:16.170]  or whatever.
[41:16.170 --> 41:17.130]  Make yourself, have something,
[41:17.130 --> 41:18.890]  just have some food ready is what I'm saying.
[41:18.890 --> 41:20.130]  Peanut butter and jelly sandwich is perfect.
[41:20.130 --> 41:21.130]  Everyone's got that,
[41:21.130 --> 41:22.330]  but you might not be able to eat that.
[41:22.330 --> 41:25.170]  So have something ready that you can just snack on
[41:25.170 --> 41:26.650]  and be in a cool environment.
[41:26.650 --> 41:27.730]  Take a couple puffs.
[41:28.690 --> 41:30.770]  If it goes wrong, eat your food.
[41:31.610 --> 41:33.210]  Wait an hour or two, you'll be just fine.
[41:33.210 --> 41:34.570]  But where I'm headed with this
[41:34.570 --> 41:36.210]  is if you're new to medical marijuana
[41:36.210 --> 41:38.570]  and you're thinking about trying medical marijuana,
[41:38.570 --> 41:40.410]  this is something I think you should think about.
[41:40.410 --> 41:42.970]  Cannabis is a very smart plant.
[41:42.970 --> 41:44.490]  Cannabis has been here for a long time
[41:44.490 --> 41:46.530]  and I'm sure that it was given to us
[41:46.530 --> 41:48.330]  for a medicinal purpose,
[41:48.330 --> 41:51.550]  which lets me think that if you have some pain
[41:51.550 --> 41:54.210]  or an ailment that you're trying to medicate
[41:54.210 --> 41:57.970]  through cannabis, cannabis will target that ailment
[41:57.970 --> 42:00.630]  before it will cause intoxication.
[42:01.470 --> 42:03.150]  So let's say you've got a broken part.
[42:03.150 --> 42:04.070]  I'm gonna say my knee.
[42:04.070 --> 42:05.950]  My left knee swells up by the end of the day
[42:05.950 --> 42:07.110]  if I don't do something about it.
[42:07.110 --> 42:09.430]  My left knee hurts if I work hard,
[42:09.430 --> 42:11.590]  if I'm squatting up and down, carrying shit,
[42:11.590 --> 42:13.350]  my left knee will start to throb.
[42:13.350 --> 42:15.110]  It'll hurt a little bit.
[42:15.110 --> 42:16.790]  I'll take a few dabs, right?
[42:16.790 --> 42:19.070]  First two dabs, I don't get high from it,
[42:19.070 --> 42:20.590]  but I can feel my knee.
[42:20.590 --> 42:23.390]  The first dab, the constant pain,
[42:23.390 --> 42:25.510]  the like the, oh, that goes away.
[42:25.510 --> 42:26.350]  One dab.
[42:27.510 --> 42:29.150]  Now I can relax.
[42:29.150 --> 42:31.430]  But I'm still at the point where if I put pressure on it
[42:31.430 --> 42:33.790]  and try to lift up something and walk up some stairs,
[42:33.790 --> 42:34.630]  it hurts.
[42:34.630 --> 42:36.630]  So dab number two removes that.
[42:36.630 --> 42:37.850]  Now I'm at level.
[42:37.850 --> 42:41.590]  I'm pain-free at sit still and I'm pain-free at work mode.
[42:41.590 --> 42:42.830]  I'm pain-free now.
[42:42.830 --> 42:45.910]  My next dab kinda makes me feel high.
[42:45.910 --> 42:48.190]  Now I'm getting to recreational dabs.
[42:48.190 --> 42:49.790]  My third dab, now I'm just high.
[42:49.790 --> 42:51.390]  Or my fourth dab, sorry, now I can't even count.
[42:51.390 --> 42:52.470]  Fourth dab, now I'm just high.
[42:52.470 --> 42:54.190]  I'm trying to get fucked up having fun.
[42:54.190 --> 42:57.150]  So I believe that cannabis and cannabinoids
[42:57.190 --> 43:01.030]  know how to go target that pain and deal with that pain.
[43:01.030 --> 43:03.190]  So if you are legitimately,
[43:03.190 --> 43:06.070]  and I feel the same thing works with opiates or other pills.
[43:06.070 --> 43:09.030]  If you break your knee and you go to the doctor
[43:09.030 --> 43:09.910]  and they give you Vicodin,
[43:09.910 --> 43:10.870]  they're probably gonna give you something better
[43:10.870 --> 43:12.430]  than Vicodin, but I don't know about pharmaceuticals
[43:12.430 --> 43:13.710]  because I don't fuck with them.
[43:13.710 --> 43:15.050]  If you break your knee and you go to the doctor,
[43:15.050 --> 43:16.910]  they're gonna give you pills.
[43:16.910 --> 43:18.070]  If you have something broken,
[43:18.070 --> 43:19.790]  you're not gonna get high as fuck off those pills
[43:19.790 --> 43:21.230]  if you take the recommended dosage.
[43:21.230 --> 43:22.270]  It's gonna go to your knee.
[43:22.270 --> 43:25.190]  If you take, if you're not broken and you take those pills,
[43:25.190 --> 43:26.990]  you're probably gonna get high and feel like shit from them
[43:27.830 --> 43:29.830]  because you don't have any pain to deal with.
[43:29.830 --> 43:31.790]  And I think cannabis knows that is what I'm getting at.
[43:31.790 --> 43:34.710]  So if you're afraid of cannabis, that is my encouragement.
[43:34.710 --> 43:36.110]  Cannabis is very smart.
[43:36.110 --> 43:37.550]  Cannabis is very gentle.
[43:37.550 --> 43:39.270]  Cannabis wants to be your friend.
[43:40.150 --> 43:42.470]  I have consumed a lot of things in my life.
[43:42.470 --> 43:45.350]  Some things were not my friend.
[43:45.350 --> 43:47.510]  Some things made me feel like shit.
[43:47.510 --> 43:49.350]  Some things made me see the devil.
[43:49.350 --> 43:52.270]  Cannabis has always been my friend in every situation.
[43:52.270 --> 43:55.230]  If I was sick, if I was well, if I was bummed out,
[43:55.270 --> 43:58.430]  if I was happy, cannabis has always been my buddy.
[43:58.430 --> 44:00.590]  So if you're thinking about trying cannabis
[44:00.590 --> 44:01.830]  or if you've got somebody in your life
[44:01.830 --> 44:03.910]  that you want to encourage to use cannabis,
[44:03.910 --> 44:05.630]  give them a pep talk that cannabis knows
[44:05.630 --> 44:07.070]  where to go hit the pain.
[44:07.070 --> 44:08.310]  And if you've got pain and you got a problem,
[44:08.310 --> 44:09.910]  you're not gonna get too fucked up right away
[44:09.910 --> 44:12.990]  because cannabis wants to solve that problem first.
[44:12.990 --> 44:13.870]  All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[44:13.870 --> 44:15.110]  somebody asked for longer episodes.
[44:15.110 --> 44:16.190]  It's been 45 minutes.
[44:16.190 --> 44:18.430]  It's hard to go a full hour by myself.
[44:18.430 --> 44:20.510]  I feel like I'm just rambling out here.
[44:20.510 --> 44:23.070]  I hope you enjoyed this 45 minute solo episode.
[44:23.070 --> 44:24.750]  Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna give a huge shout out

[44:59.190 --> 45:00.830]  You guys, all I am asking for is help
[45:00.830 --> 45:03.350]  with offsetting the cost of my website
[45:03.350 --> 45:05.070]  where I host the podcast.
[45:05.070 --> 45:07.850]  I read geneticscolorado.com does cost
[45:07.850 --> 45:10.030]  a little bit of money every year to keep up.
[45:10.030 --> 45:11.350]  I just want a little help doing that.
[45:11.350 --> 45:13.030]  I will cover it if you guys can't,
[45:13.030 --> 45:15.830]  but if you feel like the podcast was worth a couple of bucks,

[46:02.310 --> 46:04.150]  There are people out there that cannot do it.
[46:04.150 --> 46:05.390]  I'm not in this for the money.
[46:05.390 --> 46:07.750]  I am in this because I love cannabis.

[46:18.510 --> 46:21.190]  physically, and technologically,
[46:21.190 --> 46:22.670]  God damn, that was a hard word,
[46:23.270 --> 46:27.910]  it's still hard, technologically and financially
[46:27.910 --> 46:30.630]  available to do it, I will keep this podcast coming.

[46:37.190 --> 46:38.390]  I feel like I'm starting to ramble.

[47:20.110 --> 47:22.470]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Maddie.
[47:22.470 --> 47:24.910]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[47:24.910 --> 47:26.750]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[47:26.750 --> 47:28.190]  Three words to the party.
[47:28.190 --> 47:30.830]  Smoke weed everyday so I can make my pay.
[47:30.830 --> 47:32.870]  Selling light green kush, pound for pound.
[47:32.870 --> 47:34.910]  It's the old school sound I'm throwing down.
[47:34.910 --> 47:36.590]  I'm a smoker and a dealer.
[47:36.590 --> 47:39.110]  See, I got a slang to my best ability.
[47:39.110 --> 47:41.270]  I got the kush that'll knock you down.
[47:41.270 --> 47:45.340]  I like the blunt, then I got the work.
[47:45.340 --> 47:47.540]  The stuff I like to smoke when I irk and jerk.
[47:47.540 --> 47:49.580]  Put that kush up in the air.
[47:49.580 --> 47:51.420]  Throw your head back and scream oh yeah
[47:51.420 --> 47:55.420]  because I am Afro man selling weed straight from Afghanistan.
[47:55.420 --> 47:57.540]  So light it up, pass it around.
[47:57.540 --> 48:47.990]  When you need some more, I'll be around.
[48:47.990 --> 48:48.990]  Kush is what we want.
[48:48.990 --> 48:52.790]  Kinky feeling, marijuana selling, West Coast Afro man.
[48:52.790 --> 48:56.990]  Slang weed in Europe, Africa, Amsterdam, and Japan.
[48:56.990 --> 48:59.070]  If you want the best, buy from the West.
[48:59.070 --> 49:01.110]  Hit this and you'll agree.
[49:01.110 --> 49:03.190]  When you're in need of some bomb ass weed,
[49:03.190 --> 49:05.150]  you'll spend big money with me, you see.
[49:05.150 --> 49:07.550]  Because when I was a little baby boy,
[49:07.550 --> 49:09.550]  I used to make chronic bugs I did enjoy.
[49:09.550 --> 49:13.550]  Digitube and hand scales, blowjobs in between sales.
[49:13.550 --> 49:16.550]  Getting rich from God's creation like the real Rick Ross,
[49:16.550 --> 49:17.550]  I'm surfing the nation.
[49:17.550 --> 49:19.550]  I made up my mind just what to do,
[49:19.550 --> 49:21.550]  and I started up the Hungry Usba group.
[49:21.550 --> 49:24.550]  Go crazy, go crazy, smoke till you get dizzy.
[49:24.550 --> 49:26.550]  This ain't it, we can see it, you can get it,
[49:26.550 --> 49:28.550]  you can burn it, I don't want to talk about it.
[49:28.550 --> 49:29.550]  You got it, man, you got it.
[49:29.550 --> 49:30.550]  I'm about to give it.
[49:30.550 --> 49:32.550]  My bad, my bad, I got hot, I got hot.
[49:32.550 --> 49:34.550]  I'm going to cue action to bring you back.
[49:34.550 --> 49:35.550]  My bad, my bad, all right.
[49:35.550 --> 49:36.550]  All right, ready?
[49:36.550 --> 49:37.550]  Take two.
[49:37.550 --> 49:40.550]  Go crazy, smoke till your vision is hazy.
[49:40.550 --> 49:42.550]  Beats in your ears, burgundy eyes,
[49:42.550 --> 49:44.550]  drinking cotton mouth, quenching code 45.
[49:44.550 --> 49:46.550]  If you don't know how to smoke, get ready to learn,
[49:46.550 --> 49:48.550]  because Afro's taking his turn to burn.
[49:48.550 --> 49:51.550]  Take an eight, a quarter, an ounce, money up front,
[49:51.550 --> 49:52.550]  so I can bounce.
[49:52.550 --> 49:56.550]  Take a pound, take it out of town, catch in my hand.
[49:56.550 --> 49:57.550]  It's Afro, man, I got the beat.
[49:57.550 --> 50:00.550]  Got to switch to sweet, without me smoking, it's incomplete.
[50:00.550 --> 50:03.550]  Like this, yo, like that, yo, like my women,
[50:03.550 --> 50:04.550]  I like my blunts, fat ho.
[50:04.550 --> 50:06.550]  Smoke this, smoke that, my blunts are fat.
[50:06.550 --> 50:09.550]  Afro man got weed like that, everybody in the street
[50:09.550 --> 50:12.550]  smoking on my sack, having THC, asthma attack.
[50:12.550 --> 50:14.550]  Buy an ounce, yo, buy a pound.
[50:14.550 --> 50:16.550]  Why you listen to the rhythm of the reefer sound?
[50:16.550 --> 50:18.550]  Slang a zip a zip, like a crazy dream,
[50:18.550 --> 50:20.550]  in the American dream, inhaling vapor steam.
[50:20.550 --> 50:24.550]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it.
[50:24.550 --> 50:26.550]  We turn to blunt, blood turn to roach,
[50:26.550 --> 50:28.550]  and you hit it till nobody want it.
[50:28.550 --> 50:33.550]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it.
[50:33.550 --> 50:35.550]  We turn to blunt, blood turn to roach,
[50:35.550 --> 50:37.550]  and you hit it till nobody want it.
[50:37.550 --> 50:39.550]  Cause smoking weed is what I do best,
[50:39.550 --> 50:41.550]  yes, yes, princess, I'm from the west.
[50:41.550 --> 50:43.550]  If you don't think Afro man's for real,
[50:43.550 --> 50:45.550]  let me tell you what happened to the man of steel.
[50:45.550 --> 50:49.550]  Superman came to town to see what he could sell.
[50:49.550 --> 50:53.550]  He stacked his mail high as hell until he re-palmed it.
[50:53.550 --> 50:55.550]  His pounds were stacked three stories high,
[50:55.550 --> 50:57.550]  his bond was made of steel.
[50:57.550 --> 51:01.550]  I said Afro man, run this land, he said, boy, be for real.
[51:02.550 --> 51:06.550]  He's faster than the sheriff department if they was smoking crack.
[51:06.550 --> 51:10.550]  Exhale my super breath and give the whole world contact.
[51:10.550 --> 51:14.550]  I can fly my pounds around the world without catching no heat.
[51:14.550 --> 51:18.550]  I socialize with x-ray eyes and a grape swishy sweet.
[51:18.550 --> 51:22.550]  He opened up his zip-lock bag and the vapors began to smell.
[51:22.550 --> 51:26.550]  And all the potheads started sniffing, wandering through the dell.
[51:26.550 --> 51:30.550]  And just when he had sold a pound and thought his weed was ripe,
[51:30.550 --> 51:34.550]  I invented a sack and took the town back with Palmdale Cryptonite.
[51:34.550 --> 51:39.550]  That's right, Superman said, yes, indeed, this is that Palmdale Tumperweed.
[51:39.550 --> 51:43.550]  I said, now that you know the deal, bring all your dollar bills to my coop to build.
[51:43.550 --> 51:47.550]  I'm Afro man from East Palmdale, I got that cryptonite for sale.
[51:47.550 --> 51:51.550]  I do it right, cause I can't do it wrong, that's why the whole world wanna hit my butt.
[51:51.550 --> 51:55.550]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it.
[51:55.550 --> 51:59.550]  We turn to blood, blood turn to roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it.
[52:00.550 --> 52:04.550]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it.
[52:04.550 --> 52:08.550]  We turn to blood, blood turn to roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it.
[52:08.550 --> 52:12.550]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it.
[52:12.550 --> 52:16.550]  We turn to blood, blood turn to roach and you hit it till don't nobody want it.
[52:16.550 --> 52:20.550]  Smoke on it, smoke on it, smoke and smoke and choke on it.
