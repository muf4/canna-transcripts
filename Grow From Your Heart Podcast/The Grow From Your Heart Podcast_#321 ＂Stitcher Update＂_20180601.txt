[00:00.000 --> 00:04.280]  Hey what's up cannabis community, it's Rasta Jeff and it's time for a really quick episode
[00:04.280 --> 00:06.120]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.120 --> 00:10.680]  I've been getting messages from people who are trying to listen to the podcast on the
[00:10.680 --> 00:15.080]  Stitcher application with an Android device and there have been a lot of errors.
[00:15.080 --> 00:19.040]  I've been in contact with Stitcher for a couple of days and I think I have identified the
[00:19.040 --> 00:22.200]  issue and I think I have found a solution.
[00:22.200 --> 00:26.240]  The only way I can verify that I have corrected the issue is by putting out an episode and
[00:26.240 --> 00:31.720]  hoping people are able to listen on their Android devices through the Stitcher application.
[00:31.720 --> 00:35.240]  If you've been trying to listen to my show on your Android phone through the Stitcher
[00:35.240 --> 00:37.960]  app and it has been failing, I apologize.
[00:37.960 --> 00:39.440]  Everything should be fixed.
[00:39.440 --> 00:43.440]  All of the episodes you were unable to listen to are on YouTube.
[00:43.440 --> 00:46.320]  All of the episodes are also available on the Stitcher website.
[00:46.320 --> 00:49.680]  The only issue was with the Stitcher application.
[00:49.680 --> 00:53.160]  People were able to download the episodes and listen to them later but if you were trying
[00:53.160 --> 00:59.080]  to stream it and you were not on a Wi-Fi, you were unable to access many of the episodes.
[00:59.080 --> 01:03.000]  If you want to go back and try to re-download them, you can do that but I suggest you check
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.880]  them out on YouTube.
[01:04.880 --> 01:09.000]  Once again, I want to apologize to everybody for not being able to listen to my episodes.
[01:09.000 --> 01:12.560]  I know that you rely on my teaching and I know that a lot of people look forward to
[01:12.560 --> 01:13.560]  the show.
[01:13.560 --> 01:15.560]  I know I get some people through their shitty work week.
[01:15.560 --> 01:18.280]  So I apologize for not being there for you.
[01:18.280 --> 01:22.800]  Thanks for sticking by and if I lost you for a few episodes, welcome back.
[01:22.800 --> 01:26.880]  And if you're listening on iTunes or any other podcast service or YouTube or through
[01:26.880 --> 01:31.280]  my website, hey, thanks for sticking around and thanks for joining me for a quick episode.
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.560]  Alright you guys, I'm going to wrap up this quickie.
[01:33.560 --> 01:38.400]  I would appreciate it if you could share that the podcast has been repaired on Stitcher.
[01:38.400 --> 01:42.400]  If you can tweet the show, if you can post an Instagram post, anything to help me out
[01:42.400 --> 01:46.280]  and let the audience know that I'm back on Stitcher, I would appreciate that because
[01:46.280 --> 01:49.440]  I can tell by my numbers that I lost quite a few people.
[01:49.440 --> 01:51.600]  Alright you guys, that's all I've got for you today.
[01:51.600 --> 01:53.960]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[01:53.960 --> 01:55.400]  Thanks for all the love and support.
[01:55.400 --> 01:58.480]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
