[00:00.510 --> 00:06.110]  This is Jeff Tate and you're watching the Grow From Your Heart podcast with my
[00:06.110 --> 00:14.750]  favorite weed grower Rasta Jeff. Now take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[00:14.750 --> 00:30.250]  Here we go. Welcome to the show podcast world. I'm your host my friends call me
[00:30.250 --> 00:35.210]  Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 563 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.210 --> 00:39.650]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at seedsherenow.com

[01:14.370 --> 01:19.410]  show off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of Bananas Foster
[01:19.410 --> 01:25.290]  live batter from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of banana OG and Paris Larry. On the package the
[01:25.290 --> 01:30.690]  flavor is described as banana, sugar and oatmeal. I think I agree with those flavor descriptions.
[01:30.690 --> 01:35.810]  We have talked about the banana fosters on the show before. I really enjoy the banana turps. I
[01:35.930 --> 01:41.170]  think I forgot how much I enjoy banana turps. Not only do I enjoy the flavor of a banana strain but
[01:41.170 --> 01:46.850]  the buzz that comes with it is really desirable in my opinion. So I'm really digging the Bananas
[01:46.850 --> 01:54.570]  Foster live batter. On the back of the package it says it contains 67.57% THC and non-detectable
[01:54.570 --> 02:00.290]  amounts of CBD. Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the perfect Bananas Foster
[02:00.850 --> 02:07.050]  live batter. Alright in this episode I'm going to cover a maintenance checklist. This episode
[02:07.050 --> 02:12.130]  will come out on the 31st. Tomorrow will be the first. That is a good time to do a bunch of grow
[02:12.130 --> 02:16.730]  room maintenance. Before we get to the main part of the show let's do some shout outs to the members
[02:16.730 --> 02:22.450]  of the 710 club. Of course the 710 club are the folks who support the show on Patreon at the 710

[03:06.170 --> 03:11.410]  learn how to do that, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[03:11.450 --> 03:14.370]  forward slash grow from your heart, all of the information
[03:14.370 --> 03:16.850]  you need will be right there on the screen. And of course, I did
[03:16.850 --> 03:21.410]  include a link in the show notes to make it nice and easy. I
[03:21.410 --> 03:24.530]  think that covers most of the business part of this episode.
[03:24.690 --> 03:29.370]  Let's jump into this grow room maintenance checklist. We spend
[03:29.370 --> 03:32.650]  a lot of money on gear in the grow. We rely on all of that
[03:32.650 --> 03:35.450]  equipment to work properly, but it's not going to run on its
[03:35.450 --> 03:37.690]  own without a little bit of a checkup without some
[03:37.690 --> 03:40.330]  maintenance without some routine maintenance. So once in a
[03:40.330 --> 03:42.930]  while, we need to think about the moving parts in the grow and
[03:42.930 --> 03:45.490]  maybe take care of them update them a lot of things need
[03:45.570 --> 03:48.450]  maintenance, many things may need replaced, especially if you
[03:48.450 --> 03:51.250]  haven't been doing maintenance. So what are some of the things
[03:51.370 --> 03:54.330]  in the grow room that we really need to maintain? I started
[03:54.330 --> 03:57.490]  thinking about this list, just by going through my day in the
[03:57.490 --> 04:00.490]  grow in my head and thinking what are the tools and equipment
[04:00.490 --> 04:03.130]  that I touch and that I pay attention to one of the first
[04:03.130 --> 04:07.170]  things that came to my mind was my pH meter, I use my pH meter
[04:07.170 --> 04:10.770]  on a daily basis. I've got multiple pH meters. I've got a
[04:10.770 --> 04:14.210]  blue lab combo meter that's stuck to the wall, the probes
[04:14.210 --> 04:17.890]  dangle into a reservoir, I can always see the pH, the EC and
[04:17.890 --> 04:21.010]  the PPMs and the temperature in that reservoir at all times. I
[04:21.010 --> 04:24.530]  like that device. However, sometimes I second guess my
[04:24.530 --> 04:27.690]  equipment, how do I know that that one device is reliable. So
[04:27.690 --> 04:32.210]  I've got a second pH pen to double check my first pH pen, I
[04:32.210 --> 04:34.890]  use the pH testing solution, I make sure that they all test
[04:34.890 --> 04:38.010]  right, then I double check with two pins occasionally, I just
[04:38.010 --> 04:41.490]  want to double check because pH is very important, especially to
[04:41.490 --> 04:44.730]  a cocoa grower, somebody running a hydro system, your pH is going
[04:44.730 --> 04:48.850]  to be very important. So let's clean and calibrate our pH
[04:48.850 --> 04:52.810]  meters on a regular basis as a grower, your pH meter, if you're
[04:52.810 --> 04:56.250]  a salt based grower, if you're a cocoa, a hydro type grower, your
[04:56.250 --> 04:59.850]  pH meter is like your hammer or your saw. If you were a
[04:59.850 --> 05:02.730]  carpenter, that is something you bust out every day on a daily
[05:02.730 --> 05:06.730]  basis, you need your hammer and your saw to work reliably. So
[05:06.730 --> 05:11.770]  let's get a good quality pH pen, a good quality EC meter, all the
[05:11.770 --> 05:14.250]  good quality meters that you can get. We don't want trash here.
[05:14.250 --> 05:17.810]  We don't want junk here. Like I said in a previous episode, I
[05:17.810 --> 05:20.650]  believe you get what you pay for when it comes to pH meters
[05:20.650 --> 05:24.370]  and EC meters and testing devices. So pay for those get
[05:24.370 --> 05:27.610]  quality devices, then let's maintain them. Let's clean them
[05:27.610 --> 05:30.010]  we need to clean the probes they come with a cleaning solution.
[05:30.010 --> 05:32.250]  If you don't have it order a little bit of cleaning solution.
[05:32.250 --> 05:36.730]  It's not expensive. Clean your probes, recalibrate your pH
[05:36.730 --> 05:39.370]  meters. If you haven't been doing it on at least a monthly
[05:39.370 --> 05:43.050]  basis. I recommend weekly every Monday, just start the Monday
[05:43.050 --> 05:45.210]  off just by calibrating your meters. It doesn't take that
[05:45.210 --> 05:48.170]  much time and it feels really good to know that your gear is
[05:48.170 --> 05:52.010]  in top shape. So clean and calibrate your meters, your pH
[05:52.010 --> 05:55.450]  pen, your EC pen, your PPM pen, whatever you've got clean and
[05:55.450 --> 05:58.530]  calibrate those bad bitches. Now here's something that you may
[05:58.530 --> 06:02.090]  not know I'm not sure that I knew this. When you acquire a
[06:02.090 --> 06:07.010]  new pH pen, you are supposed to soak that pen in the storage
[06:07.010 --> 06:11.330]  solution, the KCI storage solution for 24 hours before
[06:11.370 --> 06:14.530]  you activate that new pH pen. I've seen a lot of people get a
[06:14.530 --> 06:17.450]  new pen, pull it out of the box, dip it in calibration
[06:17.450 --> 06:20.050]  solution, start mixing solution and use that as their
[06:20.050 --> 06:23.450]  calibration tool. That's not the way to do it. We need to take
[06:23.450 --> 06:26.610]  these pins out of the box, fill a most of them come with a
[06:26.610 --> 06:30.290]  little cup, fill that little cup with your KCI storage solution,
[06:30.570 --> 06:34.490]  set the probe in there for 24 hours. Then after 24 hours, use
[06:34.490 --> 06:37.290]  your four and seven and possibly some companies use other
[06:37.290 --> 06:40.650]  calibration standards, but use your four and your seven and
[06:40.650 --> 06:43.290]  calibrate your device that way and then rinse it off then now
[06:43.290 --> 06:46.770]  you are ready to pH your solution. You can put it in your
[06:46.770 --> 06:49.570]  nutrient solution and it will show you an accurate reading but
[06:49.890 --> 06:52.050]  those things don't come out of the box ready to go. They need
[06:52.050 --> 06:54.730]  some prep, they need some love, we need to soak it, then we need
[06:54.730 --> 06:57.850]  to calibrate it. So don't forget those steps. Take good care of
[06:57.850 --> 07:00.250]  your equipment and it will continue to take good care of
[07:00.250 --> 07:04.690]  you. Another thing, keep that probe on your pH pen moist. If
[07:04.690 --> 07:08.410]  that probe dries, it dies, the grower cries. Keep that fucker
[07:08.410 --> 07:11.170]  wet because once it goes dry, you've got to buy a new one and
[07:11.170 --> 07:14.730]  they are not cheap. Good quality pH pens are expensive.
[07:15.130 --> 07:19.010]  The best way to remember to always keep your pH pen moist is
[07:19.010 --> 07:23.410]  to forget to moisten one. You spend 130 bucks, it dries up, it
[07:23.410 --> 07:26.850]  dies, grower cries, you got to spend another 130 bucks at the
[07:26.850 --> 07:29.530]  growth store. Blue Lab is happy with you. The guy at the growth
[07:29.530 --> 07:32.370]  store is excited but you're at 130 bucks because you let that
[07:32.370 --> 07:35.330]  fucker dry. Alright, let's keep moving. Another thing that I
[07:35.330 --> 07:38.730]  think about we need to maintain is cleaning all of the filters.
[07:38.730 --> 07:41.650]  What kind of filtration do you have in your grow room? Do you
[07:41.650 --> 07:46.490]  have an air conditioner? I have got a 14,000 BTU rolling air
[07:46.490 --> 07:49.530]  conditioner with a filter in the back of it. That thing needs
[07:49.530 --> 07:53.010]  cleaned about every two weeks. It gets sticky, it gets dusty in
[07:53.010 --> 07:56.210]  there. It's got a filter in it. Pop that filter out, take it to
[07:56.210 --> 07:58.730]  where there's a sink and just hose it down, then let it dry,
[07:58.850 --> 08:01.770]  then put it back. Clean out that filter. That will increase air
[08:01.770 --> 08:04.930]  flow, that will decrease restriction, air restriction on
[08:04.930 --> 08:07.370]  your air conditioner, which makes the air conditioner work
[08:07.370 --> 08:10.530]  harder, which makes it last less time. If we maintain these
[08:10.530 --> 08:13.450]  devices, they will last longer for us. We need this gear to
[08:13.450 --> 08:16.930]  last. Money is expensive. We're not making a lot of money on
[08:16.930 --> 08:18.970]  growing cannabis these days because everybody's growing
[08:18.970 --> 08:22.650]  cannabis. Every dollar and every gram counts. So maintain the
[08:22.650 --> 08:25.450]  gear we've got with the time we've got and make this gear
[08:25.450 --> 08:28.690]  stick around. So clean the filters in your air conditioner,
[08:28.890 --> 08:32.370]  clean the filters in your humidifier and dehumidifier.
[08:32.370 --> 08:35.850]  Those should be done probably every three to five, maybe seven
[08:35.850 --> 08:38.370]  days. But if you haven't done it, get in there and do it and
[08:38.370 --> 08:41.250]  add that shit to your task list. Put that on your general
[08:41.250 --> 08:44.570]  maintenance list. Clean the filters on the humidifier and
[08:44.570 --> 08:47.930]  dehumidifier. Check them. They're probably gunky. If you
[08:47.930 --> 08:50.810]  haven't cleaned them in a while, they're probably gross. Other
[08:50.810 --> 08:53.970]  things to check out the RO filter if you're running reverse
[08:53.970 --> 08:57.250]  osmosis or if you got a big boy filter or a small boy filter.
[08:57.490 --> 09:00.330]  Are those filters in there? Are they any good? Is your membrane
[09:00.330 --> 09:03.210]  any good in your filtration? Are you just running water through a
[09:03.210 --> 09:05.930]  device and wasting time and not really cleaning it and thinking
[09:05.930 --> 09:08.850]  you're cleaning it? Are those as it time to change those filters
[09:08.890 --> 09:12.970]  is that do also irrigation filters in a commercial
[09:12.970 --> 09:16.050]  environment, I run a big reservoir with a pump that goes
[09:16.050 --> 09:19.770]  up a bunch of PVC tubing. And one point of that PVC tubing,
[09:19.890 --> 09:22.850]  there's a straight line going up and a filter that hangs down at
[09:22.850 --> 09:26.770]  a 45 degree angle going down. The idea is that the heavy
[09:26.770 --> 09:29.370]  sediments will fall into that filter and the water will keep
[09:29.370 --> 09:32.010]  moving so that by the time my water gets to the end of the
[09:32.010 --> 09:34.570]  line, it doesn't clog up my emitters with chunky nutrient
[09:34.570 --> 09:38.850]  dust. Those filters need to be cleaned often depending on what
[09:38.850 --> 09:41.450]  we feed. If we mix up certain nutrients, we have to clean that
[09:41.570 --> 09:44.250]  fucking filter while we're feeding but most of the time,
[09:44.370 --> 09:47.170]  it's a once every couple of days, once a week sort of thing.
[09:47.250 --> 09:50.170]  If you haven't cleaned that filter now is the time get in
[09:50.170 --> 09:52.690]  there and clean that shit. It's the first of the month. It's
[09:52.690 --> 09:56.490]  Monday. Let's get in there and clean shit up. Monday is the
[09:56.490 --> 09:58.890]  second but this comes out on the 31st. So you've got a day to
[09:58.890 --> 10:02.610]  prepare and get your shit together. So clean all of your
[10:02.610 --> 10:06.810]  stuff, all your stuff, clean all your stuff, you guys, clean all
[10:06.810 --> 10:09.530]  of the things that have filters in there. Clean out your
[10:09.530 --> 10:12.370]  reservoirs. Do you have a reservoir where you've got 50
[10:12.370 --> 10:15.890]  gallons of water, 200 gallons of water, just 10 gallons, dump
[10:15.890 --> 10:19.770]  that fucker out and give it a good scrubbing, let it dry. If
[10:19.770 --> 10:22.890]  you use any sort of a cleaner, make sure that you rinse out all
[10:22.890 --> 10:25.330]  of that cleaner no matter what it is. If it's Fizan, if it's
[10:25.330 --> 10:28.450]  simple green, if it's bleach, make sure you remove all of that
[10:28.450 --> 10:32.130]  cleaner from your reservoir, clean it out, let it dry, rinse
[10:32.130 --> 10:35.370]  it out again, then you can reuse it but clean that res we don't
[10:35.370 --> 10:39.170]  need shit building up on the reservoir. Also, another thing
[10:39.170 --> 10:42.730]  you need to clean is the pump. Many of us are using many
[10:42.730 --> 10:45.770]  different styles of pumps. We've got hydro pumps, we've got mix
[10:45.770 --> 10:48.690]  pumps, lots of pumps going on. Many of those pumps have little
[10:48.690 --> 10:51.770]  filters in them. Many of those pumps have little moving parts.
[10:51.930 --> 10:55.210]  Take it apart, get a toothbrush, clean that shit out. I know it
[10:55.210 --> 10:58.970]  sounds tedious, but do you want your girl room to be a Ferrari or
[10:58.970 --> 11:01.530]  do you want it to be a 92 Prelude? You've got the
[11:01.530 --> 11:04.810]  opportunity to make the girl room the Ferrari if you take
[11:04.810 --> 11:07.650]  care of it, it will never run like a Ferrari. If you put
[11:07.810 --> 11:10.490]  fucking Prelude care and love into it. If you got one of them
[11:10.490 --> 11:13.210]  Preludes, it's just balling out there. No disrespect, but you
[11:13.210 --> 11:15.090]  know what I'm talking about that dude with the primer gray
[11:15.090 --> 11:17.770]  Prelude that's fucking falling apart. He didn't take care of it.
[11:17.930 --> 11:20.770]  It's falling apart. Now if you got that Ferrari every day,
[11:20.810 --> 11:23.610]  you're tinkering on that Ferrari making sure that every corner is
[11:23.610 --> 11:26.330]  polished and buff. The rims look shiny, the undercarriage is
[11:26.330 --> 11:29.010]  clean. You're making sure that Ferrari is well maintained.
[11:29.170 --> 11:32.610]  There's oil level is perfect brake fluid is perfect. muffler
[11:32.610 --> 11:35.090]  fluid is perfect. You got it all going just the way you need it.
[11:35.210 --> 11:38.130]  Let's make our grow rooms fucking Ferraris. Then we can
[11:38.130 --> 11:41.490]  win the race. Another thing I see people forgetting to clean,
[11:41.650 --> 11:44.610]  especially in a commercial environment is the measuring
[11:44.650 --> 11:47.530]  cups, which we measure our nutrients. I don't know what
[11:47.530 --> 11:49.850]  size of a girl you're working with. You may have a shot glass
[11:49.850 --> 11:52.850]  you measure 20 milliliters. You may have a like a small pitcher
[11:52.850 --> 11:56.130]  you measure 100 milliliters, whatever device you are pouring
[11:56.130 --> 11:59.130]  your nutrient solution from the bottle into this measuring cup.
[11:59.330 --> 12:02.650]  Let's clean the measuring cup. Why not? It's probably got some
[12:02.650 --> 12:05.650]  nutrient stains on it. It's got different colors on it. Are
[12:05.650 --> 12:07.970]  those salts mixing into the other nutrients you're pouring
[12:07.970 --> 12:10.970]  in there? Did bottle a just mix in with bottle B and then bottle
[12:10.970 --> 12:13.730]  C mixed with a and B. What are you doing to your nutrient
[12:13.730 --> 12:16.890]  solution? Let's clean those mixing cups. It's really not
[12:16.890 --> 12:20.130]  that hard. While we're cleaning those mixing cups. Let's also
[12:20.250 --> 12:25.090]  calibrate the scale, which we may use to measure dry powdered
[12:25.130 --> 12:27.530]  nutrients. If you're using veg bloom, you weigh those
[12:27.530 --> 12:29.610]  nutrients out by the gram they're powdered, you don't need
[12:29.610 --> 12:32.410]  to you don't do milliliters or whatever. You put it on a scale
[12:32.410 --> 12:35.370]  and you do two, five grams. If it's the base, you're doing five
[12:35.370 --> 12:38.330]  grams per gallon. If it's shine, you're probably doing two. It's
[12:38.330 --> 12:41.090]  plus life, you're probably doing one gram per gallon. We've got a
[12:41.090 --> 12:44.250]  scale. Let's clean the scale off. I see those scales covered
[12:44.250 --> 12:46.690]  in nutrients and it's gross. Let's just clean that fucker up
[12:46.690 --> 12:48.850]  get a paper towel, get some cleaner and just clean that bad
[12:48.850 --> 12:51.450]  bitch up get a rag if you're not a paper towel kind of guy. I
[12:51.450 --> 12:54.170]  get it. Someone's gonna give me feedback. I noticed as soon as I
[12:54.170 --> 12:57.370]  said that, but let's clean up that scale. Let's also calibrate
[12:57.370 --> 13:00.370]  the scale. We've calibrated our pH pens, we've calibrated
[13:00.370 --> 13:03.170]  everything else. Let's calibrate the scale. It's real easy. Most
[13:03.170 --> 13:05.370]  of the scales come with the calibration weight. Keep that
[13:05.370 --> 13:08.410]  handy. Have that next to your MSDS sheet or something to where
[13:08.410 --> 13:11.290]  you can just grab it, measure, make sure it weighs right. Make
[13:11.290 --> 13:13.810]  sure it's accurate. Go back to work measure your nutrients.
[13:14.010 --> 13:17.810]  We're measuring five grams per gallon. If you got 20 gallons,
[13:17.890 --> 13:20.890]  that's 100 grams. If you're just a little bit off, you can end
[13:20.890 --> 13:23.850]  up with 110 grams and that could actually have seriously adverse
[13:23.850 --> 13:26.770]  effects on the plants or you could give them 90 grams and the
[13:26.770 --> 13:30.650]  plants are going to be starving. So make sure that you calibrate
[13:30.730 --> 13:34.690]  and clean up the scale if you are using a scale for dry
[13:34.770 --> 13:37.650]  nutrients. We're going to move on a little bit to things that I
[13:37.650 --> 13:41.770]  see in the grow, the actual grow space. A lot of grows have
[13:41.770 --> 13:44.130]  lights. These are old school but a lot of people are still doing
[13:44.130 --> 13:46.970]  them. Some of the breeders still use these. You've got a light
[13:47.010 --> 13:51.170]  with a vented hood with glass between the bulb and the canopy
[13:51.170 --> 13:54.290]  of your plants. You got basically a big metal shoe box
[13:54.290 --> 13:57.250]  with glass on the bottom so that the bulb is inside there and it
[13:57.250 --> 13:59.730]  shines down through the glass and then you put ducting on both
[13:59.730 --> 14:02.250]  ends and you can run air over it. That way the heat from your
[14:02.250 --> 14:04.610]  bulb doesn't go down to your plants. It just gets blown right
[14:04.610 --> 14:07.010]  away by the ducting. It stays inside there because of the
[14:07.010 --> 14:10.970]  glass. That glass gets really dirty. Let's clean that glass
[14:10.970 --> 14:14.170]  you guys. There are pesticide sprays stuck to it. There are
[14:14.170 --> 14:17.690]  dead bugs stuck to it. There's hair stuck to it. Let's clean
[14:17.690 --> 14:21.330]  those. Turn them off. Let them cool because they're hot. Those
[14:21.330 --> 14:23.610]  lights have been running. Don't forget the lights are hot.
[14:23.890 --> 14:26.250]  Unplug them. Let them cool for a little while. Get a little bit
[14:26.250 --> 14:29.330]  of a wind, some Windex or some kind of a cleaner on a rag or a
[14:29.330 --> 14:31.570]  paper towel or a newspaper. However you do it, just clean
[14:31.570 --> 14:35.810]  those pieces of glass in there. That is reducing your light by
[14:35.930 --> 14:38.810]  so much percent. I'm going to say that glass probably cuts
[14:38.810 --> 14:42.530]  down your light by 5 to 15%. That's a guess. I'm really not a
[14:42.530 --> 14:44.970]  scientist when it comes to light. But then for every little
[14:44.970 --> 14:48.850]  speckle of pesticide spray or foliar spray or every bug on
[14:48.850 --> 14:52.050]  there, you're losing 2, 3, 5 more percent and you're paying
[14:52.050 --> 14:54.410]  for it. You're still plugging that light in. It's still
[14:54.410 --> 14:57.530]  cranking out electricity. It's still pumping out light. Maybe
[14:57.610 --> 15:00.570]  you're not getting as much light over the canopy as you thought.
[15:01.210 --> 15:03.330]  Let's keep moving. I've got a lot to try to cover. That's why
[15:03.330 --> 15:07.090]  I'm talking kind of fast here. Check all of the moving parts. I
[15:07.090 --> 15:09.610]  don't know what else you've got in your grow. Anything that
[15:09.610 --> 15:12.490]  makes noise that whirs that moves around the fans. Are the
[15:12.490 --> 15:14.890]  fans clicking? Is one of them wobbling? Do they oscillate
[15:14.890 --> 15:18.530]  properly? Check all of that stuff. Do a safety check. Is
[15:18.530 --> 15:20.690]  there something for your dreads to get caught up on? Is there
[15:20.690 --> 15:23.050]  some corner for you to get snagged on? Is there a sharp
[15:23.050 --> 15:25.770]  spot on a table? Is there a stick for you to poke your eye
[15:25.770 --> 15:28.410]  on? Do that kind of maintenance and just set yourself up for
[15:28.410 --> 15:30.930]  success so you don't have to slow down in the future when you
[15:30.930 --> 15:33.490]  got your hands full and you're in a rush. Take the time now to
[15:33.490 --> 15:36.210]  put some duct tape on that sharp corner. Maybe clean up that
[15:36.210 --> 15:38.490]  stuff you're going to trip on. That's more of a cleanliness
[15:38.490 --> 15:41.050]  episode. But check out all the moving parts. We've got air
[15:41.050 --> 15:44.370]  conditioners, humidifiers, dehumidifiers. We've got a ton
[15:44.370 --> 15:47.370]  of stuff to check on. Anything that's moving that's got parts,
[15:47.410 --> 15:50.050]  check on it. Listen to it. Sometimes I can hear the
[15:50.050 --> 15:52.410]  dehumidifier making the wrong noise. It's way up there and I
[15:52.410 --> 15:54.810]  can hear it. The rhythm should be wobble wobble wobble wobble
[15:54.810 --> 15:57.610]  wobble wobble but sometimes it went wobble wobble wobble wobble
[15:57.610 --> 16:00.330]  wobble wobble wobble and I know that means something went wrong.
[16:00.330 --> 16:02.690]  We need to check on it. Pay attention to that kind of shit.
[16:03.050 --> 16:07.850]  Um, check outside for light leaks. If you're growing at home,
[16:08.090 --> 16:11.130]  just walk around, walk around the house, walk around the
[16:11.130 --> 16:14.130]  building, look for light leaks. Do you see any signs that there
[16:14.130 --> 16:17.250]  is a grow inside the building? Is there light reflecting
[16:17.250 --> 16:19.530]  through your ducting? Is there light reflecting through some
[16:19.530 --> 16:22.370]  weird spot you didn't think of? Can you see the light at all?
[16:22.370 --> 16:24.490]  Can you hear any of your equipment outside that would
[16:24.490 --> 16:28.050]  tell thieves, snitches or cops that you've got something going
[16:28.050 --> 16:30.610]  on? That's part of the maintenance routine. Walk around
[16:30.610 --> 16:35.250]  the building, walk outside and check for light leaks. Um, is
[16:35.250 --> 16:38.210]  your carbon filter working? That's another important thing
[16:38.210 --> 16:41.370]  to think about is your odor control actually controlling
[16:41.370 --> 16:45.050]  odor. Sometimes I can walk into a commercial cultivation
[16:45.050 --> 16:48.210]  facility and I don't even smell herb. I'm around cannabis so
[16:48.210 --> 16:51.290]  much. My nose is blank to it. That's just like smelling normal
[16:51.290 --> 16:54.850]  air to me. So I don't smell ganja. I've driven away from my
[16:54.850 --> 16:58.210]  house before and I've come home and went, Oh, fuck, I need a new
[16:58.210 --> 17:01.810]  carbon filter. So make sure your carbon filter is working. You
[17:01.810 --> 17:05.250]  may need to leave for a full day. Go away for the entire day
[17:05.330 --> 17:08.370]  because your nose is fucked up. You smell your skunk weed. You
[17:08.370 --> 17:11.090]  don't even notice it. Go away for the day. Come back. And when
[17:11.090 --> 17:13.690]  you walk in the house, really pay attention. Do I smell my own
[17:13.690 --> 17:16.730]  ganja? If you smell it, other people can smell it because
[17:16.730 --> 17:19.650]  you're accustomed to it. And if you can smell it, it's out of
[17:19.650 --> 17:22.770]  control. You need a new carbon filter. I think many companies
[17:22.770 --> 17:26.010]  say they last two years, depending on how moist the room
[17:26.010 --> 17:28.770]  is, how much air you've been blowing through it, how well you
[17:28.770 --> 17:31.450]  took care of it. How I don't know, did you jostle it around
[17:31.450 --> 17:34.170]  when you moved it? There are so many contributing factors. A
[17:34.170 --> 17:37.210]  good one should last about 18 months. A crappy one will last
[17:37.210 --> 17:40.570]  you maybe a year. If they're really good, maybe two years. I
[17:40.570 --> 17:43.170]  only trust mine for about 18 months because I don't need that
[17:43.170 --> 17:46.370]  stink going out of the house. So check on your carbon filter.
[17:47.170 --> 17:50.370]  Excuse me for clearing the throat here. Check on all of the
[17:50.370 --> 17:54.650]  moving parts. Check on all your gear. Then let's move into part
[17:54.650 --> 17:58.050]  of a maintenance routine is also ordering supplies. What else are
[17:58.050 --> 18:00.690]  we going to need this month? It's so much easier to order
[18:00.690 --> 18:03.690]  everything in one shot and get one delivery. Or if you're going
[18:03.690 --> 18:06.130]  to the store, it's so much easier to go there. I order for
[18:06.130 --> 18:08.330]  a commercial warehouse. I can't go pick it up in the car. We get
[18:08.330 --> 18:10.650]  trucks delivered. So my mindset's a little bit different.
[18:10.650 --> 18:13.570]  But do one order every month if you can that way you don't have
[18:13.570 --> 18:16.370]  to go to the grocery store too many times to be seen there too
[18:16.370 --> 18:19.050]  much. Every time you're there, you're going to make an impulse
[18:19.050 --> 18:21.970]  buy and buy some dumb shit you didn't need. Also, every time
[18:21.970 --> 18:24.730]  you're there, you're exposing yourself to other people who
[18:24.730 --> 18:27.530]  grow who probably have spider mites or pollen or powdery
[18:27.530 --> 18:30.450]  mildew or something on them. Also, you're exposing yourself
[18:30.450 --> 18:32.410]  to a sales guy who's going to sell you some shit you don't
[18:32.410 --> 18:34.730]  need and change your whole strategy. And also you're going
[18:34.730 --> 18:37.770]  to find other growers that are going to give you ideas and sway
[18:37.770 --> 18:40.210]  you from doing what you're doing and you're doing your thing.
[18:40.210 --> 18:43.210]  It's cool to get more input but don't let that grow store go and
[18:43.250 --> 18:45.730]  seeing all that fantastical shit. Don't let it blow your
[18:45.730 --> 18:48.210]  mind and sway you from your original goal. You're doing
[18:48.210 --> 18:51.610]  fine. So minimal trips to the grow store. And we can do that
[18:51.610 --> 18:54.490]  by making a nice list. What do we need to get we need nutrients
[18:54.490 --> 18:57.370]  we know we're always going to need nutrients every week every
[18:57.370 --> 19:00.690]  month we need to feed the plants. A good responsible
[19:00.690 --> 19:04.170]  grower plans their feed for almost the entire grow before
[19:04.170 --> 19:06.890]  the grow starts. I know what the plants are going to get through
[19:06.890 --> 19:10.570]  veg weeks one through three weeks three through five and six
[19:10.570 --> 19:13.890]  through nine I know what I'm feeding every day to those
[19:13.890 --> 19:16.930]  plants so I can go to the store and buy all of those bottles in
[19:16.930 --> 19:20.490]  one shot I don't have to go back makes it very easy for me and
[19:20.490 --> 19:22.610]  the grow store loves it because I don't have to go bother them
[19:22.610 --> 19:25.570]  again. So think about all of the nutrients you're going to need
[19:25.570 --> 19:28.690]  have a strategy go to the grow store get all those nutrients in
[19:28.690 --> 19:32.850]  one shot. Also get all of your pesticides and fungicides in one
[19:32.850 --> 19:35.250]  shot think about what you're going to get you should already
[19:35.250 --> 19:37.770]  have a strategy before you're even far enough into the grow
[19:37.770 --> 19:41.010]  to need pesticides and fungicides have a strategy
[19:41.050 --> 19:44.210]  purchase the products have them ready go shake the bottles or
[19:44.210 --> 19:46.930]  your bottles low if they get this low I need to order more
[19:46.970 --> 19:50.250]  order more of that shit so make a list order your pesticides I
[19:50.250 --> 19:54.010]  always recommend having three different pesticides on hand I
[19:54.010 --> 19:57.770]  know that sounds weird but the bugs don't like a rotation if
[19:57.770 --> 19:59.730]  I've got three different pesticides they don't know if
[19:59.730 --> 20:02.730]  I'm going to throw an uppercut a left hook or a right cross they
[20:02.730 --> 20:05.770]  have no idea what the fuck to look for I can eradicate bugs
[20:05.770 --> 20:09.770]  quite quickly also I keep one fungicide on deck at all times
[20:09.770 --> 20:12.290]  as well if I see a powdery mildew situation or something
[20:12.490 --> 20:15.290]  I've already got the products here to get rid of it so be
[20:15.290 --> 20:20.010]  prepared also gloves and personal protective equipment
[20:20.170 --> 20:23.130]  buying gloves here and there it's expensive if you can buy
[20:23.130 --> 20:26.690]  enough gloves to last you the month that is much more cost
[20:26.690 --> 20:30.250]  effective and again if you're getting it online less Amazon
[20:30.250 --> 20:32.690]  shipments if you're going to the store less visits to the
[20:32.690 --> 20:35.850]  store get your gloves your personal protective equipment if
[20:35.850 --> 20:39.250]  you're spraying you need a Tyvek suit if you need respirator
[20:39.250 --> 20:42.610]  cartridges those are hard to get right now honestly the
[20:42.610 --> 20:46.130]  respirator cartridges are on back order everywhere so
[20:46.250 --> 20:48.610]  respirator cartridges hopefully you got a couple of those
[20:48.610 --> 20:51.530]  stocked up for your grow but get all the personal protective
[20:51.530 --> 20:55.330]  equipment another thing we should think about is how long
[20:55.330 --> 20:58.050]  have those bulbs been in that grow room if you're running
[20:58.050 --> 21:01.370]  conventional bulbs like HBS or metal halide bulbs they don't
[21:01.370 --> 21:05.090]  last forever it is time to change them I always write down
[21:05.090 --> 21:07.610]  when I put new bulbs in a room I've got a spot where I keep
[21:07.610 --> 21:10.810]  documentation for the grow so I'll put in a commercial grow
[21:10.810 --> 21:13.450]  here's how I do it I will write on a piece of duct tape new
[21:13.450 --> 21:16.730]  bulbs on January 1st and I put that piece of duct tape on the
[21:16.730 --> 21:21.170]  door to the grow room it's very obvious these bulbs January 1st
[21:21.210 --> 21:24.770]  so in the determined amount of time my determined amount of
[21:24.770 --> 21:27.650]  time and the owner and investors determined amount of time for
[21:27.650 --> 21:30.450]  changing bulbs are always different they don't want to buy
[21:30.450 --> 21:32.970]  bulbs until it's fucking dark in the grow they don't realize
[21:32.970 --> 21:35.570]  that those bulbs are still sucking up 100% of the
[21:35.570 --> 21:38.810]  electricity but not putting out 100% of the light because the
[21:38.810 --> 21:41.810]  bulbs are dying so they don't fucking want to buy new bulbs
[21:41.850 --> 21:44.970]  until the harvest comes and they realize why didn't we pull as
[21:44.970 --> 21:47.530]  much as we did last time and you say the bulbs are shot we're not
[21:47.530 --> 21:49.810]  getting as much light as we did and they go oh really it would
[21:49.810 --> 21:52.130]  have made that much difference we'll buy bulbs now and he had
[21:52.130 --> 21:55.410]  to show them the hard way so how long have your bulbs been in
[21:55.410 --> 21:58.170]  your grow is it time to swap those out did you use a par
[21:58.170 --> 22:00.570]  meter did you do anything to document how much light you're
[22:00.570 --> 22:02.650]  getting and how much light you're getting now did you write
[22:02.650 --> 22:05.210]  down the day that those bulbs were put in there maybe it's
[22:05.210 --> 22:08.290]  time to get new bulbs mark down the day and start fresh with a
[22:08.290 --> 22:11.410]  good idea because like I said when you plug in that ballast
[22:11.610 --> 22:14.170]  that electricity happens it gets generated it gets moved down the
[22:14.170 --> 22:17.130]  cable it gets put into your fucking socket it tries to come
[22:17.130 --> 22:19.850]  out of the light it's still giving it 1000 watts if your
[22:19.850 --> 22:23.130]  bulbs only going I'm burned out I'm gonna put out like 700 watts
[22:23.170 --> 22:27.010]  you're ripping yourself off for 30% you're still paying for it
[22:27.210 --> 22:29.970]  the electric company doesn't go Oh your harvest was light we'll
[22:29.970 --> 22:33.890]  give you a break they don't give half of a shit so make sure your
[22:33.890 --> 22:37.170]  light bulbs are in good condition if you're using LEDs
[22:37.210 --> 22:39.810]  those should last for quite a while but they will degrade over
[22:39.810 --> 22:44.490]  time you have a much longer lifespan on your LEDs what else
[22:44.490 --> 22:47.450]  we're gonna talk about mop heads and stuff like that order
[22:47.450 --> 22:51.050]  cleaning supplies many of you overlook how important
[22:51.050 --> 22:53.530]  cleanliness is in your grow room and you just kind of half ass
[22:53.530 --> 22:56.570]  that let's stop that shit it's the first of the month let's get
[22:56.570 --> 22:59.090]  in there and clean all that shit up and start off with a fresh
[22:59.130 --> 23:03.130]  clean month you may need new mop heads I am certain that you
[23:03.130 --> 23:06.730]  need trash bags maybe you need another dedicated trash can for
[23:06.730 --> 23:09.770]  the grow area that you can just set right there and not have to
[23:09.770 --> 23:12.850]  go chasing down a trash bag all the time have a trash can
[23:12.930 --> 23:17.210]  prepared to go also do you need to order more rags or paper
[23:17.210 --> 23:20.130]  towels or whatever you use to clean stuff also do you have a
[23:20.130 --> 23:23.050]  bunch of newspapers on hand so when you spill something you
[23:23.050 --> 23:25.290]  can just go grab a stack old newspaper and stack those
[23:25.290 --> 23:27.610]  newspapers on the wetness and it'll suck it all up for you
[23:27.890 --> 23:31.170]  that is a grow trick from way back in the day keep all the old
[23:31.170 --> 23:34.570]  newspapers in a pile you spill some liquids drop the newspaper
[23:34.570 --> 23:37.490]  on their newspaper will clean it right up it was free throw it
[23:37.490 --> 23:40.930]  away not a big deal another thing you may need to stock up
[23:40.930 --> 23:44.530]  on if you can find it I highly recommend that you get some
[23:44.530 --> 23:49.570]  isopropyl alcohol I like to clean my shit with 91% ISO it's
[23:49.570 --> 23:52.010]  hard to shit to find right now during these weird pandemic
[23:52.010 --> 23:56.490]  times isopropyl alcohol will hit the shelf and it is frenzied
[23:56.490 --> 23:59.570]  over and it is a melee people put in the carts and it's gone I
[23:59.570 --> 24:02.330]  usually grab about six bottles try to keep them stacked up on
[24:02.330 --> 24:05.290]  top of the fridge if you can get some isopropyl alcohol for
[24:05.290 --> 24:08.410]  cleaning your equipment that is gold that's going to be useful
[24:08.490 --> 24:11.290]  for many, many cleaning applications in the grow you can
[24:11.290 --> 24:13.930]  clean your scissors with it when you're cutting clones you can
[24:13.930 --> 24:16.490]  clean your scissors with it when you're trimming I like to have
[24:16.490 --> 24:19.330]  some ISO around I also like to clean the rigs with it so when
[24:19.330 --> 24:22.050]  you're ordering supplies and shit try to get yourself some
[24:22.050 --> 24:26.210]  ISO you may need to go hit the smaller stores at Walmart doesn't
[24:26.210 --> 24:28.630]  have it I hate Walmart I don't go to Walmart I would much
[24:28.630 --> 24:31.650]  prefer Walgreens but sometimes you got to go all over the place
[24:31.650 --> 24:35.410]  looking for ISO right now so order all of your stuff that's
[24:35.410 --> 24:37.970]  part of the maintenance on the on the first you got to check all
[24:37.970 --> 24:40.850]  of the equipment any moving parts anything that squeaks
[24:40.850 --> 24:43.730]  rattles runs anything that takes water anything that takes a
[24:43.730 --> 24:47.010]  filter maintenance all of that gear like I said before all of
[24:47.010 --> 24:50.610]  the equipment is expensive and it will last much longer if we
[24:50.610 --> 24:53.930]  just give it some love every occasionally once a week once
[24:53.930 --> 24:57.090]  every two weeks once a month as often as it needs make sure you
[24:57.090 --> 24:59.210]  check on your equipment once you've checked on all the
[24:59.210 --> 25:01.810]  equipment how are your nutrients and supplies doing you don't
[25:01.810 --> 25:04.130]  want to run out of shit you don't want to be cutting clones
[25:04.130 --> 25:06.690]  and realize I don't have any clone gel you've got all these
[25:06.690 --> 25:09.650]  clones cut you got your dome setup and no fucking clone gel
[25:09.770 --> 25:12.650]  make sure you've got all of the stuff you're going to need set
[25:12.650 --> 25:14.810]  yourself up for success then once you've got all your
[25:14.810 --> 25:17.970]  nutrients and things that's when you're going to need pesticides
[25:17.970 --> 25:21.090]  and things like that then we will move into cleaning supplies
[25:21.250 --> 25:23.610]  make sure you've got all the shelves stocked make sure you're
[25:23.610 --> 25:27.690]  well ready to go and prepared also part of the monthly
[25:27.690 --> 25:30.330]  maintenance checklist I almost forgot does the fire
[25:30.330 --> 25:33.370]  extinguisher have a charge your fire extinguisher has got a
[25:33.370 --> 25:36.050]  little gauge the fire extinguisher may be a roster
[25:36.050 --> 25:38.730]  because it's got a red a yellow and a green chart on it and you
[25:38.730 --> 25:41.330]  want to be obviously in that green that's when the fire
[25:41.330 --> 25:44.050]  extinguisher is the best when it gets to the yellow it is time
[25:44.050 --> 25:46.970]  to get that fire extinguisher either replaced or recharged
[25:47.290 --> 25:49.450]  depending on the size quality and brand of your fire
[25:49.450 --> 25:52.490]  extinguisher many of them once they get to that point they're
[25:52.490 --> 25:55.410]  done they've got to be disposed of properly some of them if
[25:55.410 --> 25:58.170]  they're the correct kind you can take it to the fire department
[25:58.170 --> 26:00.850]  and they will actually recharge that for you and make sure that
[26:00.850 --> 26:03.970]  you've got a safe fire extinguisher also while we're on
[26:03.970 --> 26:06.450]  the subject check all the batteries and your smoke
[26:06.450 --> 26:09.090]  detectors and your carbon monoxide detectors if you're
[26:09.250 --> 26:12.130]  running co2 in your grow space that carbon monoxide detector be
[26:12.330 --> 26:15.490]  a totally different story but if you are if you've got smoke
[26:15.490 --> 26:17.970]  detectors go test them out make sure that they work we don't
[26:17.970 --> 26:22.090]  want to just have them as props we want those to work all right
[26:22.170 --> 26:26.370]  I think that wraps up my grow room maintenance episode I think
[26:26.370 --> 26:28.370]  the other thing I could say is just stand by the door
[26:28.370 --> 26:31.850]  occasionally and just look I notice a lot of details that I
[26:31.850 --> 26:34.810]  didn't think about but I'm just looking I've just got this look
[26:34.810 --> 26:40.250]  into the grow just looking just glass and just staring at the
[26:40.250 --> 26:42.810]  plants I don't know what I'm looking for but I'll find
[26:42.810 --> 26:46.250]  something I always find one thing that the grower the grow
[26:46.250 --> 26:48.370]  techs be like what are you staring at boss man I don't know
[26:48.370 --> 26:51.450]  yet but it'll tell me then a couple couple minutes into my
[26:51.450 --> 26:54.610]  weird stare I go that that's the problem we got to fix you guys

[26:56.730 --> 26:59.490]  get a grow tech on it and I go help them figure it out we solve
[26:59.490 --> 27:02.530]  the issue I noticed a lot of problems just doing the growers
[27:02.570 --> 27:05.970]  gaze notice a lot of issues that way able to solve them it's a
[27:05.970 --> 27:08.730]  lot of passion and a lot of dedication to the plants all
