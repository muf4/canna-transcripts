[01:53.070 --> 01:55.010]  was about a strain called Grateful Dog.

[02:09.070 --> 02:09.910]  I love seeing that.
[02:09.910 --> 02:11.230]  So keep the comments coming.
[02:11.230 --> 02:13.210]  Thank you for all of that stuff.
[02:13.210 --> 02:14.330]  I do also wanna let you know
[02:14.330 --> 02:18.610]  that the Halloween sale is live on iredirect.com.
[02:18.610 --> 02:20.730]  That's right, by the time this episode comes out,
[02:20.730 --> 02:23.190]  there will be blueberry butcher 10 packs
[02:23.190 --> 02:26.950]  and possibly some Arise B-grade seed 10 packs
[02:26.950 --> 02:29.730]  available on iredirect.com.
[02:29.730 --> 02:32.470]  There are plenty of the blueberry butcher seeds,
[02:32.470 --> 02:36.090]  but there are not a lot of the Arise B-grade seeds.
[02:36.630 --> 02:38.230]  The Arise B-grade seeds are great seeds.
[02:38.230 --> 02:40.870]  However, they're not as aesthetically pleasing
[02:40.870 --> 02:42.030]  as some of the other seeds.
[02:42.030 --> 02:44.730]  They're a little smaller, they're not as big,
[02:44.730 --> 02:46.870]  they're not as round, they're not as perfectly shaped,
[02:46.870 --> 02:47.990]  they're not as tiger striped,
[02:47.990 --> 02:49.910]  but they do a germination test.
[02:49.910 --> 02:51.830]  They germinate, they grow great plants.
[02:51.830 --> 02:52.870]  They're just not as pretty.
[02:52.870 --> 02:54.470]  We call them B-grade seeds.
[02:54.470 --> 02:56.750]  We sell them for a lower price in bulk bundles.
[02:56.750 --> 02:59.510]  They are available on iRedirect while supplies last.
[02:59.510 --> 03:00.750]  Go check them out.
[03:00.750 --> 03:02.470]  Also, while supplies last,
[03:02.470 --> 03:04.550]  if you do buy a pack of blueberry butcher,
[03:04.570 --> 03:06.570]  everybody will get a free 10 pack
[03:06.570 --> 03:10.530]  of Platinum Tangy X2 Jack the Ripper as a free gift,
[03:10.530 --> 03:12.730]  as a thank you for supporting the holiday sale.
[03:12.730 --> 03:15.890]  Also, every order at iRedirect does come with free seeds,
[03:15.890 --> 03:18.210]  extra seeds, freebies, bonus gifts,
[03:18.210 --> 03:21.150]  and that is also included or in addition
[03:21.150 --> 03:24.770]  to your free pack of Platinum Tangy 2 Jack the Ripper.
[03:24.770 --> 03:27.370]  So that is my advertising for the iRedirect.
[03:27.370 --> 03:30.050]  There's also new merch coming in the merch store.
[03:30.050 --> 03:32.170]  I got some long sleeve t-shirts made.
[03:32.170 --> 03:33.770]  I got some hoodies made,
[03:33.770 --> 03:35.650]  and I also got women's tank tops made
[03:35.650 --> 03:36.750]  that I think look really good,
[03:36.750 --> 03:38.350]  will look really good on the ladies.
[03:38.350 --> 03:40.070]  So make sure you check out the website,
[03:40.070 --> 03:42.590]  look for the merch link and grab the tank tops.
[03:42.590 --> 03:46.750]  They should be posted by the time this episode does come out.
[03:46.750 --> 03:49.350]  The newsletter is the easiest way to stay updated
[03:49.350 --> 03:52.730]  for all of those merchandise and seed drop updates.
[03:52.730 --> 03:56.350]  To join the newsletter, go to my website, iRegenetics.com.
[03:56.350 --> 03:57.270]  You will see on the bottom,
[03:57.270 --> 03:59.930]  there's a part where it says, join the newsletter,
[03:59.930 --> 04:02.310]  stay up to date, type in your email address.
[04:02.310 --> 04:03.670]  I will add you to the newsletter.
[04:04.370 --> 04:05.650]  That way, when I send out the newsletter,
[04:05.650 --> 04:07.250]  you will get an update about new drops,
[04:07.250 --> 04:09.050]  new strains, new merchandise.
[04:09.050 --> 04:10.370]  You will stay up to date.
[04:10.370 --> 04:12.970]  By the way, Patreon gets all of those updates first,
[04:12.970 --> 04:14.970]  and they also get coupon codes.
[04:14.970 --> 04:16.210]  So join the Patreon.
[04:16.210 --> 04:19.090]  You'll get notified of new seed drops very first.
[04:19.090 --> 04:20.830]  You'll also get notified
[04:20.830 --> 04:23.010]  of the new merchandise drops very first,
[04:23.010 --> 04:26.250]  and you'll also get coupon codes for both.
[04:26.250 --> 04:27.490]  The reason that the Arise seeds
[04:27.490 --> 04:29.390]  are possibly already sold out on the website
[04:29.390 --> 04:32.310]  is because the patrons got first crack at them.
[04:32.310 --> 04:33.610]  All right, let me find where I am in the notes
[04:34.430 --> 04:35.830]  to keep going here.
[04:35.830 --> 04:38.650]  So recently, it is Halloween season.
[04:38.650 --> 04:39.630]  This episode, I'm gonna talk about
[04:39.630 --> 04:40.590]  a couple of scary things.
[04:40.590 --> 04:42.090]  It is the Halloween season.
[04:42.090 --> 04:44.910]  Recently, I got to go to Eelich Gardens in Denver
[04:44.910 --> 04:48.070]  and enjoy their Wicked Witch or their Witch Haunting,
[04:48.070 --> 04:51.050]  something scary witch, freaky witches night,
[04:51.050 --> 04:53.550]  the witches walk or something like that at Eelich's.
[04:53.550 --> 04:55.310]  You know, the Halloween thing that they do,
[04:55.310 --> 04:56.390]  it was pretty damn cool.
[04:56.390 --> 04:57.230]  It was a good time.
[04:57.230 --> 04:59.950]  I got to take Miss Irie or Dread Vibes or Zara,
[04:59.950 --> 05:02.710]  as I know her, got to take her to Eelich's
[05:02.730 --> 05:03.930]  and go to the haunted houses.
[05:03.930 --> 05:05.050]  It was a really good time.
[05:05.050 --> 05:08.610]  Guys, I recommend you get blazed and go to a haunted house.
[05:08.610 --> 05:10.490]  Take some dabs and go get scared.
[05:10.490 --> 05:11.770]  That is a really funny feeling,
[05:11.770 --> 05:13.790]  a fun feeling, an exciting feeling.
[05:13.790 --> 05:16.430]  I'm really used to getting blazed and doing the normal day.
[05:16.430 --> 05:17.930]  Love to get blazed and see music.
[05:17.930 --> 05:20.130]  I love to get too lit up and go see comedy.
[05:20.130 --> 05:22.530]  Getting super dabbed out and going through a haunted house
[05:22.530 --> 05:24.630]  was quite an experience.
[05:24.630 --> 05:26.650]  Fun adrenaline, fun giggles.
[05:26.650 --> 05:28.890]  It's that like running giggle kind of scare
[05:28.890 --> 05:29.730]  that was a good time.
[05:29.730 --> 05:31.350]  Like there's a person with a chainsaw behind me,
[05:31.350 --> 05:32.570]  but you know they're not gonna kill you,
[05:33.430 --> 05:35.930]  but something in your mind, you think they might kill you.
[05:35.930 --> 05:37.010]  It was a really good time.
[05:37.010 --> 05:39.270]  So shout out to the haunted house.
[05:39.270 --> 05:40.110]  That was a good time.
[05:40.110 --> 05:42.270]  Also, thanks for not killing us to the killer clown
[05:42.270 --> 05:43.670]  with the chainsaw.
[05:43.670 --> 05:45.710]  What I was getting at is this thought
[05:45.710 --> 05:47.470]  made me think of some funny things.
[05:47.470 --> 05:49.070]  What are some of the scariest things
[05:49.070 --> 05:51.210]  I've ever seen in a grow room?
[05:51.210 --> 05:54.230]  I've seen some pretty scary shit in grow rooms before.
[05:54.230 --> 05:56.070]  So I wanted to just really quickly here,
[05:56.070 --> 05:58.070]  go over some of the scary shit
[05:58.070 --> 05:59.630]  that I have seen in grow rooms.
[05:59.650 --> 06:02.850]  The number one scariest thing I have ever seen
[06:02.850 --> 06:04.450]  and have seen in multiple rooms
[06:04.450 --> 06:07.710]  is just basically overloading electrical sockets
[06:07.710 --> 06:10.310]  and electrical currents and electrical panels.
[06:10.310 --> 06:12.290]  You guys, you're not supposed to plug in
[06:12.290 --> 06:15.450]  2000 watt lights into one receptacle
[06:15.450 --> 06:16.550]  unless it's been upgraded.
[06:16.550 --> 06:18.530]  If that's a normal house receptacle,
[06:18.530 --> 06:19.450]  you're gonna melt some shit.
[06:19.450 --> 06:20.570]  You're going to burn some shit.
[06:20.570 --> 06:23.130]  It will either be the receptacle, the wiring,
[06:23.130 --> 06:25.410]  the breaker, something in the breaker box,
[06:25.410 --> 06:27.690]  or you may have just a full blown fire,
[06:27.690 --> 06:29.330]  which does lead me to talking about
[06:30.030 --> 06:30.950]  some of the scariest shit I've seen in breaker boxes.
[06:30.950 --> 06:33.350]  I've seen people put clips on the breaker
[06:33.350 --> 06:34.590]  so the breaker won't flip.
[06:34.590 --> 06:35.870]  You guys don't do that.
[06:35.870 --> 06:36.710]  That is scary.
[06:36.710 --> 06:39.510]  That breaker flips so that nothing else goes wrong.
[06:39.510 --> 06:41.230]  That's your fail safe so you don't get a fire.
[06:41.230 --> 06:43.130]  And I've seen people just put a clip on it
[06:43.130 --> 06:45.230]  so that it stays in place or put a screw behind it
[06:45.230 --> 06:46.710]  so it will not move.
[06:46.710 --> 06:47.710]  What the fuck?
[06:47.710 --> 06:49.450]  That is scary to me, bro.
[06:49.450 --> 06:51.230]  That is scary.
[06:51.230 --> 06:53.830]  I've also seen exposed fans and blowers.
[06:53.830 --> 06:56.790]  I've cut the shit out of my finger on an exposed blower.
[06:56.790 --> 06:58.870]  I had to get 13 stitches in a finger.
[06:59.370 --> 07:01.450]  My fingers aren't that big for 13 stitches.
[07:01.450 --> 07:04.250]  Had to get a lot of stitches because of an exposed blower.
[07:04.250 --> 07:07.970]  But exposed fans, exposed blowers,
[07:07.970 --> 07:11.210]  things that are moving, moving parts that are always exposed
[07:11.210 --> 07:12.170]  scare the shit out of me.
[07:12.170 --> 07:15.070]  That stuff makes me nervous.
[07:15.070 --> 07:17.170]  Other things that have always scared the shit out of me,
[07:17.170 --> 07:19.810]  I've walked into grow rooms and I've seen,
[07:19.810 --> 07:22.770]  I called it the spider mite teepee center.
[07:22.770 --> 07:24.490]  I walked into a commercial grow,
[07:24.490 --> 07:26.090]  which I was paid to go help them.
[07:26.090 --> 07:27.890]  The first time I walked in there, I flip in the lights,
[07:27.910 --> 07:30.470]  I walk in and I look and the top colas look like
[07:30.470 --> 07:32.710]  they've got circus tents of spider mites
[07:32.710 --> 07:34.430]  just hanging off of them.
[07:34.430 --> 07:36.710]  That was truly scary.
[07:36.710 --> 07:39.550]  Something inside of that made me wanna run and throw up.
[07:39.550 --> 07:41.670]  I was overwhelmed by the amount of bugs
[07:41.670 --> 07:44.870]  that I had seen in that room.
[07:44.870 --> 07:46.710]  Something else that freaks me out
[07:46.710 --> 07:49.190]  is when I see too much water and electricity
[07:49.190 --> 07:50.030]  next to each other.
[07:50.030 --> 07:53.270]  I see people reaching in to reservoirs
[07:53.270 --> 07:54.230]  to get pumps and things.
[07:54.230 --> 07:56.550]  And sometimes that scares the shit out of me,
[07:56.570 --> 07:58.970]  just basically freaks me out, I don't know why.
[07:58.970 --> 08:00.850]  Then something that really scares me
[08:00.850 --> 08:04.290]  are automatic trimming machines and wood chippers.
[08:04.290 --> 08:05.550]  That trim machine that's got like,
[08:05.550 --> 08:07.770]  it just looks like a barrel with holes in it.
[08:07.770 --> 08:09.930]  And then it's got a blade, a fan blade that spins
[08:09.930 --> 08:11.590]  and you just set the buds on that.
[08:11.590 --> 08:13.970]  I've seen people fuck themselves up with that thing
[08:13.970 --> 08:14.830]  so many times.
[08:14.830 --> 08:16.290]  It is the trim reaper.
[08:16.290 --> 08:18.730]  I've seen it trim as many fingers and dreadlocks
[08:18.730 --> 08:20.570]  and elbows as I have weed.
[08:20.570 --> 08:22.330]  That thing is fucking scary.
[08:22.330 --> 08:24.130]  I had a coworker, we won't say his name,
[08:24.130 --> 08:25.870]  shout out bro if you listen to this.
[08:25.890 --> 08:27.730]  We had to run all of the old sticks
[08:27.730 --> 08:29.450]  and all the leftover through a wood chipper.
[08:29.450 --> 08:31.610]  And this dude would stick his fucking hand
[08:31.610 --> 08:33.050]  in the wood chipper and unclog it.
[08:33.050 --> 08:34.450]  That was some of the scariest shit
[08:34.450 --> 08:36.970]  that I would ever see in a grow environment,
[08:36.970 --> 08:39.650]  watching that dude stick his hand in there.
[08:39.650 --> 08:41.370]  Sometimes walking through with the MED
[08:41.370 --> 08:43.650]  could be quite scary or the health department
[08:43.650 --> 08:46.130]  or the fire department doing inspections could be scary.
[08:46.130 --> 08:48.570]  But honestly, the scariest thing I've ever encountered
[08:48.570 --> 08:50.530]  in a commercial or personal grow
[08:50.530 --> 08:53.010]  was I was in a really large commercial grow facility
[08:53.010 --> 08:54.490]  and the power went out.
[08:54.510 --> 08:56.190]  And I'm not afraid of the dark,
[08:56.190 --> 08:59.670]  but something about being in that giant cultivation facility
[08:59.670 --> 09:01.430]  and I didn't remember when the power went out,
[09:01.430 --> 09:02.950]  I went, which room am I in?
[09:02.950 --> 09:05.070]  Am I in room A or B or C?
[09:05.070 --> 09:07.450]  And where's the fucking door?
[09:07.450 --> 09:09.290]  How do I get out of here?
[09:09.290 --> 09:10.870]  It took a little while for me to figure out
[09:10.870 --> 09:13.450]  my way out of that room without running into tables,
[09:13.450 --> 09:14.710]  tripping over lines.
[09:14.710 --> 09:15.690]  That was kind of scary.
[09:15.690 --> 09:17.270]  That really did freak me out.
[09:17.270 --> 09:18.830]  So that's some of the scariest shit
[09:18.830 --> 09:20.150]  that I've seen in grow rooms.
[09:20.150 --> 09:22.430]  Just wanted to ramble for a minute about that.
[09:22.610 --> 09:25.010]  I'm sure that since the Halloween season is coming up,
[09:25.010 --> 09:26.410]  everybody's in spooky mode.
[09:26.410 --> 09:28.330]  I wanted to participate.
[09:28.330 --> 09:29.610]  Now it's time for me to segue.
[09:29.610 --> 09:31.650]  I wanna give a shout out to my friends at the DGC,
[09:31.650 --> 09:33.090]  the Dude Grow Show.
[09:33.090 --> 09:34.370]  Shout out to the Dude Grow Show.
[09:34.370 --> 09:36.170]  I was recently on their podcast.
[09:36.170 --> 09:37.850]  People have been asking, when will it come out?
[09:37.850 --> 09:38.850]  Well, guess what, bro?
[09:38.850 --> 09:41.210]  That episode is now available.
[09:41.210 --> 09:43.530]  In that episode, we talk a little bit about,
[09:43.530 --> 09:46.370]  they have a debate, they call it Herm seed or bag seed.
[09:46.370 --> 09:48.970]  In my opinion, it is bag seed
[09:48.970 --> 09:50.690]  because we don't know if that seed
[09:50.710 --> 09:52.550]  is derived from an intersex plant
[09:52.550 --> 09:56.910]  or if that seed arrived or derived from pollen or stress.
[09:56.910 --> 09:58.170]  We don't know what caused that seed.
[09:58.170 --> 10:00.290]  So we call that a bag seed in my opinion.
[10:00.290 --> 10:02.070]  We go very in depth in that
[10:02.070 --> 10:04.270]  on the Dude Grow Show real briefly here.
[10:04.270 --> 10:06.510]  I'm gonna tell you something that I really agree with.
[10:06.510 --> 10:07.990]  If you have bag seeds, people say,
[10:07.990 --> 10:09.510]  what should I do with these bag seeds?
[10:09.510 --> 10:11.470]  My advice is grow them.
[10:11.470 --> 10:13.350]  Always grow those bag seeds.
[10:13.350 --> 10:14.350]  Pay attention to them.
[10:14.350 --> 10:15.630]  They could be crazy.
[10:15.630 --> 10:16.750]  They could be terrible.
[10:16.750 --> 10:17.750]  They could be amazing.
[10:17.750 --> 10:20.070]  You don't know what you've got until you grow it.
[10:20.410 --> 10:22.410]  Bag seeds are like a major gamble.
[10:22.410 --> 10:23.450]  It's like a lottery ticket.
[10:23.450 --> 10:25.530]  You could have just grown some trash
[10:25.530 --> 10:27.730]  or you could have grown the winner.
[10:27.730 --> 10:30.090]  Let's talk about the winners that have come from bag seed.
[10:30.090 --> 10:33.730]  Do you realize that Gorilla Glue number four
[10:33.730 --> 10:35.090]  was technically bag seed?
[10:35.090 --> 10:36.570]  That was an accidental pollination.
[10:36.570 --> 10:37.970]  It wasn't meant to happen.
[10:37.970 --> 10:40.330]  Those seeds were taken out of the bag of weed.
[10:40.330 --> 10:41.890]  That is bag seed.
[10:41.890 --> 10:45.410]  You guys, golden goat was accidental pollination
[10:45.410 --> 10:47.410]  and is technically bag seed.
[10:47.410 --> 10:48.810]  Now let's blow everybody's mind.
[10:48.830 --> 10:51.750]  All of the Chemdog crosses, I've said this before,
[10:51.750 --> 10:56.750]  Chem4, Chem91, ChemD, ChemSys, those are all bag seed.
[10:57.590 --> 10:58.830]  If you don't know the story of Chemdog
[10:58.830 --> 11:00.510]  and the legend of the 13 beans,
[11:00.510 --> 11:02.990]  I highly recommend you do some cannabis research
[11:02.990 --> 11:07.250]  and learn about Chemdog and the legend of the 13 beans.
[11:07.250 --> 11:09.190]  Dude named Chem acquired some herb.
[11:09.190 --> 11:11.150]  There's a longer story to this.
[11:11.150 --> 11:13.590]  In that herb, there were some seeds.
[11:13.590 --> 11:14.870]  His name wasn't Chemdog yet.
[11:14.870 --> 11:15.710]  He had another name.
[11:15.710 --> 11:16.530]  What's up, dude?
[11:16.530 --> 11:17.590]  I'm not even gonna say your name.
[11:17.690 --> 11:19.170]  But our friend had a different name
[11:19.170 --> 11:21.370]  and then he acquired these seeds from some weed
[11:21.370 --> 11:23.570]  that they called, some people called it the Chemweed.
[11:23.570 --> 11:24.990]  Some people called it the dog butt.
[11:24.990 --> 11:26.730]  It got called Chemdog.
[11:26.730 --> 11:29.410]  The guy that later became Chemdog got some of that weed
[11:29.410 --> 11:31.730]  from some guys at a Grateful Dead show in Colorado.
[11:31.730 --> 11:34.050]  He liked it so much, he made connects with them.
[11:34.050 --> 11:36.850]  Later on, allegedly, they shipped him some of the weed.
[11:36.850 --> 11:39.450]  Within that weed, there were 13 seeds.
[11:39.450 --> 11:40.710]  He grew some of those seeds.
[11:40.710 --> 11:43.990]  That is where the Chemdog line all came from.
[11:43.990 --> 11:47.210]  The Chem91 obviously popped in 91.
[11:47.750 --> 11:50.470]  There was probably ABC and D, right?
[11:50.470 --> 11:51.530]  There was Chem Sister.
[11:51.530 --> 11:52.950]  That's kind of obvious.
[11:52.950 --> 11:55.350]  So there were different phenotypes of the chem
[11:55.350 --> 11:56.870]  that came from different seeds.
[11:56.870 --> 11:59.430]  Those were bag seed.
[11:59.430 --> 12:02.270]  Now that chem stuff is in almost everything we breed with,
[12:02.270 --> 12:04.270]  grow, smoke, and enjoy today.
[12:04.270 --> 12:06.190]  Chem are cushes in everything.
[12:06.190 --> 12:08.450]  So my advice to you, the quick version,
[12:08.450 --> 12:09.830]  which is already the long version,
[12:09.830 --> 12:12.230]  is grow those bag seeds, but be careful
[12:12.230 --> 12:13.630]  because you don't know what you've got.
[12:13.630 --> 12:16.210]  Do you have gold or do you have absolute trash?
[12:16.230 --> 12:17.950]  Just pay attention as you grow it.
[12:17.950 --> 12:19.390]  You could have, watch out for intersex,
[12:19.390 --> 12:20.790]  watch out for mutations,
[12:20.790 --> 12:23.650]  but also watch out for the fucking winner.
[12:23.650 --> 12:24.510]  All right, let me move on
[12:24.510 --> 12:25.990]  from talking about the Dude Grow show.
[12:25.990 --> 12:29.070]  You can watch that episode to see my full rant on that show.
[12:29.070 --> 12:30.470]  Of course, once again, thanks to my friends
[12:30.470 --> 12:31.870]  at the Dude Grow show.
[12:31.870 --> 12:33.830]  Big up to Scotty, big up to the dude,
[12:33.830 --> 12:36.770]  and of course, shout out to my buddy, Graham Bowe.
[12:36.770 --> 12:37.670]  All right, let's move forward
[12:37.670 --> 12:41.470]  and talk about some other things on my mind lately.
[12:41.470 --> 12:43.350]  There are a lot of new commercial grows
[12:43.370 --> 12:46.210]  coming on the market in other states and other locations,
[12:46.210 --> 12:49.450]  and with that means a lot of people are acquiring clones.
[12:49.450 --> 12:52.110]  Something I'm seeing is that people are very skeptical
[12:52.110 --> 12:54.570]  on bringing in clones into their new commercial facility
[12:54.570 --> 12:57.210]  because they are afraid that they are going to get clones
[12:57.210 --> 12:58.330]  with problems.
[12:58.330 --> 13:01.050]  They wanna know how to buy clones that are problem-free.
[13:01.050 --> 13:02.770]  How do I know that these clones I'm getting
[13:02.770 --> 13:04.250]  don't have any issues?
[13:04.250 --> 13:05.490]  That is a very good question.
[13:05.490 --> 13:08.410]  There's one quick way to do it is to get a magnifying glass
[13:08.410 --> 13:10.550]  and give it an inspection, give it a check,
[13:10.550 --> 13:13.010]  but you're not going to see all of the problems.
[13:13.670 --> 13:15.150]  You're not going to be able to see everything,
[13:15.150 --> 13:17.190]  especially some of the viruses that are in plants.
[13:17.190 --> 13:19.390]  Now, you cannot see hoplate and viroid
[13:19.390 --> 13:20.430]  with a magnifying glass.
[13:20.430 --> 13:22.610]  You've got to do some lab testing for that.
[13:22.610 --> 13:25.110]  So basically, the quick rundown that I would do
[13:25.110 --> 13:26.490]  is I would get the clones on a tray.
[13:26.490 --> 13:27.950]  I'd just pull a few random out
[13:27.950 --> 13:30.750]  and give them a visual inspection with a magnifying glass.
[13:30.750 --> 13:32.470]  Do I see any spider mites?
[13:32.470 --> 13:33.390]  Do I see any thrips?
[13:33.390 --> 13:34.510]  Do I see any fungus gnats?
[13:34.510 --> 13:35.990]  Do I see any white flies?
[13:35.990 --> 13:38.110]  Do I see any powdery mildew?
[13:38.110 --> 13:40.710]  Give it a basic look, give it a basic oversight.
[13:40.730 --> 13:43.290]  The thing is, the people that sold you these clones
[13:43.290 --> 13:44.510]  know you're going to do that,
[13:44.510 --> 13:45.930]  so they've dunked them and treated them
[13:45.930 --> 13:47.430]  right before they brought them to you.
[13:47.430 --> 13:50.730]  So there's nothing visually detectable on these clones.
[13:50.730 --> 13:52.850]  Now, you're going to think, good, they look clean,
[13:52.850 --> 13:54.890]  but that is where you're going to go wrong.
[13:54.890 --> 13:56.430]  In my opinion, my experience,
[13:56.430 --> 13:59.170]  my advice is to treat every incoming plant
[13:59.170 --> 14:03.930]  as if it has got every single problem
[14:03.930 --> 14:05.690]  imaginable on that plant.
[14:05.690 --> 14:08.470]  It is your responsibility as the farmer
[14:08.490 --> 14:11.370]  to make sure that the incoming plants in your grow
[14:11.370 --> 14:14.050]  do not contaminate the existing plants
[14:14.050 --> 14:15.970]  in your current grow space.
[14:15.970 --> 14:19.270]  So when they come in, it is up to you to treat them.
[14:19.270 --> 14:20.410]  Make sure you do something.
[14:20.410 --> 14:21.890]  I'm not going to give you too much advice
[14:21.890 --> 14:23.470]  on what to do right now.
[14:23.470 --> 14:26.230]  I don't know what is legal or ethical in your area,
[14:26.230 --> 14:27.930]  your market, your environment.
[14:27.930 --> 14:29.290]  I don't know what you're allowed to use
[14:29.290 --> 14:30.410]  with your Department of Health
[14:30.410 --> 14:31.890]  and Department of Agriculture.
[14:31.890 --> 14:33.530]  I don't know what level of toxicity
[14:33.530 --> 14:34.890]  you are comfortable using,
[14:34.890 --> 14:36.790]  but I recommend treating every plant
[14:36.810 --> 14:40.010]  that comes into that facility with some sort of regimen,
[14:40.010 --> 14:41.410]  some sort of quarantine,
[14:41.410 --> 14:44.410]  and some sort of pesticide and fungicide regimen,
[14:44.410 --> 14:46.890]  and be aggressive about it when they come in.
[14:46.890 --> 14:47.990]  Now, the first thing I would do
[14:47.990 --> 14:49.690]  is when I get one of those clones,
[14:49.690 --> 14:53.370]  what I would really like is a hop-latent viroid test
[14:53.370 --> 14:55.970]  with those clones before I purchase them
[14:55.970 --> 14:57.530]  from a reliable clone vendor.
[14:57.530 --> 14:59.050]  If you're in a commercial industry,
[14:59.050 --> 15:01.710]  the person that is selling them to you has a license.
[15:01.710 --> 15:03.890]  They've got the money to pay for a clone,
[15:03.890 --> 15:05.410]  a hop-latent viroid test.
[15:05.430 --> 15:07.470]  Maybe they'll split the cost of the testing with you
[15:07.470 --> 15:09.470]  since you're gonna buy them, they're gonna sell them.
[15:09.470 --> 15:12.150]  It's not that expensive and it is worth it.
[15:12.150 --> 15:15.230]  So get your hop-latent viroid test done.
[15:15.230 --> 15:17.030]  Then if you do get hop-latent viroid
[15:17.030 --> 15:18.750]  from that clone in the future
[15:18.750 --> 15:20.910]  or from that plant suspected,
[15:20.910 --> 15:22.790]  then you know that you got it tested,
[15:22.790 --> 15:24.030]  or if you didn't get it tested,
[15:24.030 --> 15:25.830]  you know that it came from that grower.
[15:25.830 --> 15:27.910]  Hopefully you've got somebody to communicate with.
[15:27.910 --> 15:28.750]  You can let them know,
[15:28.750 --> 15:31.750]  hey bro, you've got hop-latent viroid in your grow.
[15:31.750 --> 15:33.110]  We all need to do something about it.
[15:33.110 --> 15:34.710]  You gotta let everybody down the line
[15:34.730 --> 15:36.010]  so that we can let them know where those clones went.
[15:36.010 --> 15:38.810]  It's kind of like getting a bad STD test, you guys.
[15:38.810 --> 15:40.130]  So when you look at these clones,
[15:40.130 --> 15:42.290]  it's just like looking at a potential partner and saying,
[15:42.290 --> 15:43.410]  no, you look clean.
[15:43.410 --> 15:44.710]  The clones are the same way, bro.
[15:44.710 --> 15:46.690]  You cannot do an STD test
[15:46.690 --> 15:49.610]  or a clone cleanliness test completely visually.
[15:49.610 --> 15:51.530]  It's not 100% reliable.
[15:51.530 --> 15:52.890]  So the first thing I would do,
[15:52.890 --> 15:55.610]  ask for that hop-latent viroid test.
[15:55.610 --> 15:56.710]  Can you get that test?
[15:56.710 --> 15:58.290]  If they've got that, you're golden.
[15:58.290 --> 15:59.290]  If you've got that test
[15:59.290 --> 16:00.610]  and you come back later with viroid,
[16:00.610 --> 16:02.930]  you've got a lot of questions to ask the lab,
[16:02.930 --> 16:04.990]  the seller and yourself, of course.
[16:04.990 --> 16:06.310]  But if they don't have that,
[16:06.310 --> 16:08.550]  then you've got to move forward with your own discretion.
[16:08.550 --> 16:09.670]  Do you trust this seller?
[16:09.670 --> 16:10.550]  Are they reliable?
[16:10.550 --> 16:12.030]  Have they been around?
[16:12.030 --> 16:13.350]  Now I'm talking about reliable.
[16:13.350 --> 16:16.570]  One thing that really concerns me when I buy clones
[16:16.570 --> 16:18.310]  is do you know what you are getting?
[16:18.310 --> 16:19.770]  Are you really gonna get Skittles?
[16:19.770 --> 16:21.150]  Are you really gonna get Gelato?
[16:21.150 --> 16:23.590]  Are you gonna get just a bunch of random plants
[16:23.590 --> 16:25.950]  that this guy has that wants to sell them to you?
[16:25.950 --> 16:28.950]  One of the most important things is develop a relationship.
[16:28.950 --> 16:31.850]  Build trust with somebody which you are buying clones from.
[16:31.850 --> 16:34.570]  These clones are going to supply your commercial facility.
[16:34.570 --> 16:37.310]  These are your money, your investment, your business.
[16:37.310 --> 16:40.190]  Put some love, some care, some work and some detail into it.
[16:40.190 --> 16:42.230]  Develop a relationship with the clone seller.
[16:42.230 --> 16:44.750]  Don't just money clones, check you next time.
[16:44.750 --> 16:46.210]  Talk to them, learn them.
[16:46.210 --> 16:47.510]  Learn what kind of clones they have.
[16:47.510 --> 16:48.870]  Learn about their business ethics.
[16:48.870 --> 16:50.710]  Research them, do some research.
[16:50.710 --> 16:52.870]  Have any of your other business partners
[16:52.870 --> 16:53.910]  done business with them?
[16:53.910 --> 16:55.550]  And how did those plants come out?
[16:55.550 --> 16:56.710]  Have they been around long enough
[16:56.710 --> 16:58.710]  to have a good or bad reputation?
[16:58.710 --> 16:59.590]  Keep that in mind.
[16:59.590 --> 17:00.910]  Maybe if they're brand new,
[17:00.930 --> 17:02.610]  maybe you're really helping them get started.
[17:02.610 --> 17:04.810]  And in the future, you'll have a strong relationship
[17:04.810 --> 17:08.290]  with one of the first clone vendors in your area.
[17:08.290 --> 17:11.050]  But to get myself back on track and keep me on the point,
[17:11.050 --> 17:13.390]  when you're talking about these clones originally,
[17:13.390 --> 17:14.850]  when you're negotiating the price
[17:14.850 --> 17:16.810]  and the amount of clones and the strains,
[17:16.810 --> 17:18.890]  ask for that Hoplite and Viroid test.
[17:18.890 --> 17:20.590]  If they can give you that, you're golden.
[17:20.590 --> 17:22.010]  You're ready to rock.
[17:22.010 --> 17:24.730]  Then even when you do get those clones,
[17:24.730 --> 17:27.250]  look at them, give them that visual assessment.
[17:27.250 --> 17:29.090]  Like I said, they probably washed them off
[17:29.090 --> 17:30.730]  right before they tried to sell them to you.
[17:30.750 --> 17:32.070]  Yeah, right before they tried to sell them to you,
[17:32.070 --> 17:33.430]  they probably cleaned them.
[17:33.430 --> 17:35.710]  Just like if you're gonna sell a guitar or a car,
[17:35.710 --> 17:37.830]  you go give it an oil change and run it through the car wash
[17:37.830 --> 17:39.210]  right before the buyer comes.
[17:39.210 --> 17:41.190]  That way it looks brand new, it looks super clean.
[17:41.190 --> 17:42.110]  It sells a little better.
[17:42.110 --> 17:44.570]  They're gonna do that to your clones as well.
[17:44.570 --> 17:46.870]  You've got to give them a visual inspection.
[17:46.870 --> 17:50.430]  Before you take them to your facility, main area,
[17:50.430 --> 17:51.670]  to your main grow,
[17:51.670 --> 17:54.870]  have some sort of a quarantine intake procedure
[17:54.870 --> 17:57.630]  and place in place already.
[17:57.630 --> 17:58.630]  Where are they gonna go?
[17:58.630 --> 17:59.790]  How are they gonna get treated?
[17:59.810 --> 18:01.290]  How long will they be there?
[18:01.290 --> 18:02.610]  How are you going to give them light?
[18:02.610 --> 18:03.730]  How are you gonna give them dark?
[18:03.730 --> 18:06.370]  And how will you give them water while they're in that space?
[18:06.370 --> 18:08.530]  How do you provide the proper environment
[18:08.530 --> 18:10.890]  for these plants in a quarantine condition?
[18:10.890 --> 18:13.450]  Most of us have a big, crazy grow space.
[18:13.450 --> 18:15.770]  We don't think about a small quarantine cell
[18:15.770 --> 18:16.730]  for incoming plants.
[18:16.730 --> 18:18.250]  However much space you may need
[18:18.250 --> 18:19.810]  for however many plants you're getting,
[18:19.810 --> 18:21.350]  you may want to quarantine them.
[18:21.350 --> 18:23.570]  So get them, inspect them, quarantine them.
[18:23.570 --> 18:25.730]  Now begin your treatment regimen.
[18:25.730 --> 18:27.410]  Most of the time, these clones won't make it
[18:27.430 --> 18:29.830]  into the general population for at least a week,
[18:29.830 --> 18:31.910]  maybe seven, 10, maybe 14 days
[18:31.910 --> 18:34.830]  before they get into the big room with everybody else.
[18:34.830 --> 18:36.830]  The minute they come into my facility,
[18:36.830 --> 18:38.910]  the front door, they go to that quarantine room
[18:38.910 --> 18:40.550]  and then guess what?
[18:40.550 --> 18:43.090]  I'm hand spraying them with a hand pump sprayer
[18:43.090 --> 18:45.430]  with the best pesticides that I can legally
[18:45.430 --> 18:47.550]  and ethically apply to those plants.
[18:47.550 --> 18:49.110]  Then I will repeat as necessary
[18:49.110 --> 18:51.270]  based on the products that I'm using.
[18:51.270 --> 18:53.950]  Probably every three, maybe every four days,
[18:53.950 --> 18:57.110]  we'll repeat that for 15 days-ish, they'll get five sprays.
[18:57.810 --> 18:59.690]  And then they go into general population.
[18:59.690 --> 19:01.970]  So make sure you treat your incoming plants.
[19:01.970 --> 19:04.050]  If you're gonna cover them in predator bugs,
[19:04.050 --> 19:05.730]  that is a good way to do it as well.
[19:05.730 --> 19:07.690]  Put the predators right on those plants,
[19:07.690 --> 19:08.530]  let them develop.
[19:08.530 --> 19:10.370]  In a future episode, we're gonna talk about
[19:10.370 --> 19:13.250]  a releasing predator and selecting predator bugs as well.
[19:13.250 --> 19:14.270]  Shout out to my buddy, Lemur,
[19:14.270 --> 19:16.690]  for the great inspiration on that show.
[19:16.690 --> 19:19.250]  But you can use predator bugs as well.
[19:19.250 --> 19:21.850]  Just make sure you have a lot of them ready to go.
[19:21.850 --> 19:23.850]  You don't want them to have to build themselves up
[19:23.850 --> 19:25.550]  to fight the army that you already brought in.
[19:25.570 --> 19:28.610]  You want them there prepared, hungry, ready to attack
[19:28.610 --> 19:31.410]  any predators that do show up.
[19:31.410 --> 19:33.250]  But the bottom line is to remember that
[19:33.250 --> 19:36.490]  when you're buying clones, it is your responsibility
[19:36.490 --> 19:38.530]  to make sure that those clones are clean.
[19:38.530 --> 19:41.490]  Every seller is going to say, my clones are clean.
[19:41.490 --> 19:43.370]  They may know that they've got bugs
[19:43.370 --> 19:45.250]  or they may not know that they've got bugs.
[19:45.250 --> 19:47.010]  They may know they've got a virus.
[19:47.010 --> 19:48.330]  They may know there's a pathogen.
[19:48.330 --> 19:49.530]  They also may not.
[19:49.530 --> 19:51.910]  And they're gonna try to tell you, my clones are clean.
[19:51.910 --> 19:53.130]  My grow is clean.
[19:53.130 --> 19:54.770]  Something I've learned is that
[19:54.790 --> 19:57.790]  the person that brags the most about the cleanest facility
[19:57.790 --> 19:59.950]  probably has the worst bug problem.
[19:59.950 --> 20:01.950]  They just have not found it yet.
[20:01.950 --> 20:03.290]  Everybody gets a bug problem.
[20:03.290 --> 20:05.870]  Don't be embarrassed if you get bugs, spider mites,
[20:05.870 --> 20:07.410]  thrips, whatever, that shit happens.
[20:07.410 --> 20:08.590]  That is part of growing.
[20:08.590 --> 20:11.550]  Learn to adjust, adapt, and overcome those things.
[20:11.550 --> 20:13.390]  You will be a true farmer.
[20:13.390 --> 20:15.030]  Let me check my time, see how long I've been going.
[20:15.030 --> 20:17.070]  That's probably only about 20 minutes.
[20:17.070 --> 20:18.070]  Let's talk real quick.
[20:18.070 --> 20:20.790]  I got one more quick question here.
[20:20.790 --> 20:22.270]  All right, through the power of editing,
[20:22.270 --> 20:24.230]  I did get that organized pretty well.
[20:24.570 --> 20:26.610]  I've got a message here that came from Patreon.
[20:26.610 --> 20:30.170]  Once again, patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[20:30.170 --> 20:32.450]  This message came from our friend, All Mixed Up,
[20:32.450 --> 20:35.490]  and it goes just like this.
[20:35.490 --> 20:37.210]  I got a used grow tent for free
[20:37.210 --> 20:38.810]  with the lights and everything.
[20:38.810 --> 20:41.450]  The problem is I know there was powdery mildew
[20:41.450 --> 20:44.870]  and spider mites all over that tent and equipment.
[20:44.870 --> 20:45.890]  So you got a free gift,
[20:45.890 --> 20:48.130]  but it came with free problems as well.
[20:48.130 --> 20:50.330]  It says, is it all worth keeping?
[20:50.330 --> 20:54.050]  It kind of depends on your needs and your requirements
[20:54.870 --> 20:56.270]  and your budget, I guess, but yeah, bro, use it.
[20:56.270 --> 20:58.510]  Let's keep it, let's use it, let's get it going.
[20:58.510 --> 21:00.690]  But then it says, should I spray it all down
[21:00.690 --> 21:03.390]  with bleach water and hydrogen peroxide?
[21:03.390 --> 21:05.030]  Same goes with the equipment.
[21:05.030 --> 21:06.350]  I've put it in my storage unit.
[21:06.350 --> 21:07.790]  I did not bring it home yet.
[21:07.790 --> 21:09.350]  Thanks, Rasta Jeff.
[21:09.350 --> 21:11.330]  All right, that is a very good question.
[21:11.330 --> 21:13.910]  I see a lot of affordable grow equipment
[21:13.910 --> 21:17.390]  available on Craigslist, available on Facebook Marketplace,
[21:17.390 --> 21:18.610]  especially at the pawn shops
[21:18.610 --> 21:20.470]  and the thrift stores around here.
[21:20.470 --> 21:21.990]  People are selling grow equipment.
[21:21.990 --> 21:23.150]  People buy grow equipment.
[21:23.170 --> 21:25.010]  They think they're gonna be the next grower.
[21:25.010 --> 21:26.390]  They realize it's a lot of work
[21:26.390 --> 21:28.730]  and they sell all their shit for super cheap.
[21:28.730 --> 21:31.130]  The problem with that is yes, it does come with problems.
[21:31.130 --> 21:32.610]  There's spider mites and powdery mildew
[21:32.610 --> 21:34.930]  and who knows what else in that stuff.
[21:34.930 --> 21:37.090]  But if it's good stuff, you can clean it
[21:37.090 --> 21:40.170]  and you can use most of those products.
[21:40.170 --> 21:41.850]  I would definitely recommend replacing
[21:41.850 --> 21:43.110]  all of the light bulbs.
[21:43.110 --> 21:46.170]  If you've got screw in bulbs, if it's LEDs, keep rocking.
[21:46.170 --> 21:47.010]  Those are good.
[21:47.010 --> 21:48.730]  But if you got like high pressure sodiums
[21:48.730 --> 21:51.490]  or metal halides, definitely unscrew those bulbs,
[21:51.490 --> 21:52.330]  put in a new bulb.
[21:52.350 --> 21:55.270]  You never have any idea how long that bulb's been in there.
[21:55.270 --> 21:56.470]  Put a freshie in there.
[21:56.470 --> 21:58.030]  I also would not recommend,
[21:58.030 --> 21:59.590]  and you didn't say you're gonna do this,
[21:59.590 --> 22:01.150]  but this is just peace of mind.
[22:01.150 --> 22:04.450]  I would not recommend using bottled nutrients
[22:04.450 --> 22:06.650]  that you bought from somebody that are open.
[22:06.650 --> 22:08.750]  You never know what could have happened,
[22:08.750 --> 22:10.350]  how long they've been sitting there,
[22:10.350 --> 22:11.910]  what could have got splashed into it,
[22:11.910 --> 22:14.630]  if it could have dried up, if some could have evaporated.
[22:14.630 --> 22:15.630]  How long has it been there?
[22:15.630 --> 22:17.090]  Is it expired?
[22:17.090 --> 22:19.830]  Chelated and buffered or chelated and buffered nutrients,
[22:19.830 --> 22:21.430]  shout out to all my Canadian friends,
[22:21.450 --> 22:23.850]  buffered nutrients will bind together over time
[22:23.850 --> 22:25.370]  if they are sitting there too long,
[22:25.370 --> 22:27.090]  they do have an expiration date.
[22:27.090 --> 22:28.490]  So pay attention to that.
[22:28.490 --> 22:31.930]  I would not use those recycled and gifted
[22:31.930 --> 22:33.430]  and leftover bottled nutrients
[22:33.430 --> 22:35.290]  or the powders even for that matter.
[22:35.290 --> 22:37.490]  But most of the equipment and stuff,
[22:37.490 --> 22:39.090]  I think you could probably use.
[22:39.090 --> 22:40.770]  I would sanitize it.
[22:40.770 --> 22:42.490]  You said you put it in your storage shed.
[22:42.490 --> 22:44.330]  I don't know where you live.
[22:44.330 --> 22:46.210]  If you put something in a storage shed
[22:46.210 --> 22:50.010]  in Colorado this summer, any bugs, powdery mildew,
[22:50.010 --> 22:51.870]  most of that shit probably got cooked.
[22:51.870 --> 22:54.470]  It got microwaved, barbecued by the natural heat.
[22:54.470 --> 22:56.750]  It's probably 150 or 170 degrees
[22:56.750 --> 22:58.350]  in a storage shed this summer.
[22:58.350 --> 23:00.530]  If you didn't have any sort of airflow, air conditioning
[23:00.530 --> 23:01.710]  or anything like that.
[23:01.710 --> 23:03.270]  If you're in Arizona or something like that,
[23:03.270 --> 23:04.550]  your shit got roasted.
[23:04.550 --> 23:06.470]  So maybe that helped you out a little bit.
[23:06.470 --> 23:08.870]  Also, I'm in Colorado, it's about to get winter time.
[23:08.870 --> 23:11.110]  We're gonna get negative 17s and shit.
[23:11.110 --> 23:13.430]  If you've got it in the garage or a storage shed,
[23:13.430 --> 23:15.270]  that may help you kill some of those things.
[23:15.270 --> 23:17.630]  Also, it may help some of them go dormant and stay longer.
[23:17.650 --> 23:20.290]  But extreme temperatures may help you get rid of stuff.
[23:20.290 --> 23:21.890]  Now, I would clean it.
[23:21.890 --> 23:24.010]  I would definitely clean everything.
[23:24.010 --> 23:26.530]  I would shine it with, I would spray it with either bleach
[23:26.530 --> 23:28.850]  or hydrogen peroxide or Fizan 20,
[23:28.850 --> 23:30.250]  something really good like that.
[23:30.250 --> 23:32.230]  Just get in there and clean everything.
[23:32.230 --> 23:33.930]  Get in every nook, every cranny.
[23:33.930 --> 23:35.690]  If you've got blowers and fans,
[23:35.690 --> 23:37.770]  I'd get a spray bottle and spray inside of there.
[23:37.770 --> 23:40.210]  So you can get everything, everything.
[23:40.210 --> 23:41.970]  You want all of it clean.
[23:41.970 --> 23:43.790]  Then I would set it up.
[23:43.790 --> 23:45.250]  Once it's all completely clean,
[23:45.250 --> 23:47.270]  I'd actually use an air compressor also
[23:47.930 --> 23:48.890]  to get inside and clean out some of the nooks
[23:48.890 --> 23:49.970]  and crannies of everything.
[23:49.970 --> 23:52.650]  Use an air compressor, a couple of Swiffers,
[23:52.650 --> 23:53.730]  a bunch of scrubbing.
[23:53.730 --> 23:55.510]  You can get that shit super clean.
[23:55.510 --> 23:56.450]  Buy a bunch of products,
[23:56.450 --> 23:59.050]  a whole bunch of cleaning products and you'll get it done.
[23:59.050 --> 24:01.010]  But clean it up, then set it up.
[24:01.010 --> 24:03.850]  Once you've got it set up, clean it all over again.
[24:03.850 --> 24:06.090]  You're gonna find spots that didn't get cleaned.
[24:06.090 --> 24:08.210]  Clean the inside and the outside,
[24:08.210 --> 24:11.090]  all of the equipment, everything all over again.
[24:11.090 --> 24:13.390]  Then plug it in, then run it.
[24:13.390 --> 24:15.210]  Let it get real hot with that light on.
[24:15.210 --> 24:16.930]  That light will speed up any cycles.
[24:17.590 --> 24:18.430]  If there are bug or eggs,
[24:18.430 --> 24:20.830]  anything in there that wants to process its life cycle,
[24:20.830 --> 24:22.350]  turning on that light, letting it run,
[24:22.350 --> 24:23.990]  that will encourage that to happen.
[24:23.990 --> 24:25.510]  There are no plants that there at this time.
[24:25.510 --> 24:27.830]  So there's nothing for them to attach to
[24:27.830 --> 24:29.070]  and eat and enjoy.
[24:29.070 --> 24:30.090]  So they won't hang out.
[24:30.090 --> 24:31.670]  They'll just go, they'll birth and they'll go,
[24:31.670 --> 24:32.990]  fuck, I need plants to live on.
[24:32.990 --> 24:34.710]  And they'll go look for some plants to live on,
[24:34.710 --> 24:36.730]  some food to eat and some other spider mites
[24:36.730 --> 24:37.870]  to breed and mate with.
[24:37.870 --> 24:40.150]  Hopefully they don't find their way to your other plants.
[24:40.150 --> 24:41.630]  Hopefully you've cleaned it up enough.
[24:41.630 --> 24:43.450]  Treat your other plants, be prepared.
[24:43.450 --> 24:44.990]  Now set it up, run it.
[24:44.990 --> 24:48.410]  Have an integrated pest management strategy in place
[24:48.410 --> 24:50.450]  and start doing that the minute you set it up
[24:50.450 --> 24:53.570]  and especially the moment you start putting plants in there.
[24:53.570 --> 24:55.370]  I do think you'll be able to clean it up enough
[24:55.370 --> 24:58.850]  because I've worked in commercial facilities
[24:58.850 --> 25:02.250]  where we've purchased old warehouses and gutted them
[25:02.250 --> 25:04.450]  and turned those into cultivation facilities.
[25:04.450 --> 25:07.310]  I know we didn't get rid of all of the old drywall,
[25:07.310 --> 25:10.170]  the old electrical wires, the old conduit.
[25:10.170 --> 25:11.450]  We didn't get rid of everything.
[25:11.450 --> 25:13.830]  The building, the facade of the building still exists.
[25:13.850 --> 25:15.810]  We just changed everything inside.
[25:15.810 --> 25:17.890]  There were still opportunities for spider mites,
[25:17.890 --> 25:21.710]  fungus gnats, thrips, white flies, mold, powdery mildew.
[25:21.710 --> 25:23.150]  All that shit could still get in there.
[25:23.150 --> 25:24.730]  Once you clean real well,
[25:24.730 --> 25:26.850]  the next step is taking care of the plants,
[25:26.850 --> 25:29.170]  the integrated pest management system.
[25:29.170 --> 25:32.070]  Manage your airflow, manage your intake, your outtake,
[25:32.070 --> 25:33.690]  your vapor pressure deficit,
[25:33.690 --> 25:36.850]  then treat the plants with a routine pest management system.
[25:36.850 --> 25:40.710]  I don't, if it's sprays or if it's live bugs, predator bugs,
[25:40.710 --> 25:42.590]  whatever you wanna do, organics,
[25:42.590 --> 25:44.010]  however you wanna do it, treat that way,
[25:44.010 --> 25:46.170]  but make sure you stay on top of it.
[25:46.170 --> 25:48.090]  And then over time, you'll be confident
[25:48.090 --> 25:49.670]  that you've destroyed all the bugs
[25:49.670 --> 25:50.970]  that did come with that tent
[25:50.970 --> 25:53.690]  if any of them did survive your cleaning.
[25:53.690 --> 25:54.970]  So clean the shit out of it.
[25:54.970 --> 25:57.410]  And I do think that you can use it again.
[25:57.410 --> 26:00.090]  If you're going to use anything that is electrical,
[26:00.090 --> 26:01.810]  I highly recommend that you inspect
[26:01.810 --> 26:03.350]  all of the electrical components,
[26:03.350 --> 26:05.450]  the lights, the blowers, air conditioners.
[26:05.450 --> 26:06.670]  Just give it a good inspection.
[26:06.670 --> 26:08.050]  Make sure nothing got burnt,
[26:08.050 --> 26:11.090]  nothing got no char marks or anything like that.
[26:11.090 --> 26:12.590]  Make sure everything's tight.
[26:12.590 --> 26:14.210]  Pay attention to it the first couple of times
[26:14.210 --> 26:15.290]  you plug it in and watch it.
[26:15.290 --> 26:18.330]  Make sure nothing sparks, arcs, burns, squeals,
[26:18.330 --> 26:19.170]  nothing like that.
[26:19.170 --> 26:21.310]  Just keep a good eye on it because it's used gear.
[26:21.310 --> 26:23.510]  You don't know why, maybe you do know why they got rid of it
[26:23.510 --> 26:25.110]  but other people listening may have gotten gear
[26:25.110 --> 26:27.550]  and they don't know why that person gave it to them
[26:27.550 --> 26:29.310]  or they got rid of it at the thrift store.
[26:29.310 --> 26:30.190]  Pay attention to it.
[26:30.190 --> 26:31.690]  Make sure you don't burn down your house
[26:31.690 --> 26:34.870]  with used equipment that came from some other person's grow.
[26:34.870 --> 26:37.390]  All right, let me check my notes, make sure I got it all.
[26:37.390 --> 26:39.870]  Inspect, replace the bulbs, don't use the nutrients.
[26:39.890 --> 26:41.810]  That's the most important part.
[26:41.810 --> 26:43.390]  Yeah, I think I covered the notes for this one.
[26:43.390 --> 26:46.010]  My dude 311, I hope your new grow tent is cleaned
[26:46.010 --> 26:47.250]  and set up and rocking.
