[00:01.720 --> 00:18.590]  Hi to the whole podcast world.
[00:18.590 --> 00:19.590]  I'm your host.
[00:19.590 --> 00:26.830]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 658 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:26.830 --> 00:30.210]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a couple of grow questions.
[00:30.210 --> 00:33.830]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those kind
[00:33.830 --> 00:36.750]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:36.750 --> 00:39.230]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:09.810 --> 01:11.110]  My new friend, Uncle Rick.
[01:11.110 --> 01:13.710]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my buddy, Thedadhaze.
[01:13.710 --> 01:17.410]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Brohan78.
[01:17.410 --> 01:20.490]  I want to send a special thank you shout-out to my buddy, Lefties Farm.
[01:20.490 --> 01:24.110]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Thomas McGuinness and MADE WHILE MEDICATED.
[01:24.110 --> 01:27.250]  I want to send a big fist bump to my buddy Tartan Mike.
[01:27.250 --> 01:31.030]  Let's send a special thank you shout-out to GreenVet88224.
[01:31.030 --> 01:33.490]  I want to send a big thank you shout-out to Rasufa.
[01:33.490 --> 01:36.450]  Let's send a big thank you shout-out to Josiah W.
[01:36.450 --> 01:42.310]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart all of the information you need is right there on the screen
[01:42.310 --> 01:47.030]  And of course I did include that link in the show notes and the video description
[01:47.030 --> 01:51.110]  You guys know the ramble about the video description the link in the show notes this time
[01:51.110 --> 01:57.290]  I'm going to remind you that I do include a discord link in the notes and the video description. That's right
[01:57.290 --> 02:00.950]  There is a discord server where there are a lot of great people hanging out right now
[02:00.950 --> 02:06.970]  There's something going on on the irie genetics grow from your heart. Irie army discord. Something is happening right now
[02:07.990 --> 02:11.630]  Billy podunk is hanging out there posting something Dave's not here
[02:11.630 --> 02:16.830]  Maybe posting something cool. Our buddy gray beard is doing something. Maybe stabby is posting something over there
[02:16.910 --> 02:22.870]  Make sure you check out the discord. It is in the show description in the notes. Follow the link
[02:23.950 --> 02:30.250]  Also before we get too far, I do want to apologize. You may hear the air conditioner rattling in the background
[02:30.610 --> 02:35.930]  It is approximately eight o'clock as I am recording and it is approximately 90 degrees outside
[02:35.930 --> 02:40.210]  It has taken me all day to get this space cool and comfortable for recording
[02:40.730 --> 02:42.250]  I'm not turning off that air
[02:42.250 --> 02:45.250]  I'm gonna let it just keep on going until it is almost cold until it's
[02:45.410 --> 02:48.050]  Uncomfortably cold and then we'll turn it down a little bit and let it readjust
[02:48.170 --> 02:51.650]  But I'm grateful that it is cooled down a little bit and I'm not turning it off
[02:51.650 --> 02:56.230]  So if you hear a couple of rattles a couple of background noises, that's just the air conditioner. Don't worry about it
[02:56.490 --> 02:58.930]  We'll be cool get it. We will be cool
[02:59.530 --> 03:01.770]  That's a dad joke if I ever heard one, all right
[03:02.130 --> 03:06.370]  What else do I want to say, please like and subscribe on YouTube ladies and gentlemen, we've got
[03:07.490 --> 03:13.650]  7,500 and some random number of subscribers at this point. I do appreciate love and respect all of those subscribers
[03:13.650 --> 03:19.610]  However, I want 10,000 subscribers once we hit that 10,000 mark. That is when the show will pop up in more
[03:20.370 --> 03:24.410]  Algorithms more people will see the show and that you may like this show or the recommended shows
[03:24.570 --> 03:27.330]  Will pop up after other people watch the dude grow show
[03:27.330 --> 03:30.610]  They'll see my show pop up after that get the show more exposure
[03:30.610 --> 03:34.490]  So what I'm asking for is for you to share the show. It is completely free
[03:34.490 --> 03:38.110]  All you have to do is tell your friends maybe share a post on social media
[03:38.130 --> 03:41.370]  Maybe just click like click subscribe leave some comments on the show
[03:41.690 --> 03:47.690]  Anything to click make the show move move us in the algorithm would be helpful. I would be grateful big
[03:47.690 --> 03:53.790]  Thank you for all that. Let's get to 10,000 subscribers you guys. I think we should have 10k. Let's push. Let's get it there
[03:54.410 --> 03:58.710]  Alright, I don't want to ramble too much. I did say I was going to focus on grow questions
[03:58.710 --> 04:03.450]  Let's get to that part of the show. This one came from my friend
[04:04.210 --> 04:09.130]  Slightly stoned stupid 42 on patreon big shout out to all of the patreon supporters
[04:09.730 --> 04:16.450]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. This one says hey Rasta Jeff. I have a question about one of your strains
[04:16.450 --> 04:21.030]  I'm trying my hand in breeding and I have a real nice scarlet begonias female
[04:21.030 --> 04:24.990]  So they're going to breed they have chosen a scarlet begonias female as the breeder
[04:24.990 --> 04:28.510]  That is a great plant to breed with a lot of great opportunities will come from that
[04:28.630 --> 04:31.390]  It says I'm breeding with a nice DJ shorts
[04:31.550 --> 04:37.750]  Navy cross male and that Navy crosses East Coast sour diesel to the DJ short blueberry f4
[04:38.150 --> 04:42.030]  That is going to be that's an amazing cross right there. You got the East Coast sour diesel
[04:42.510 --> 04:48.570]  That's straight diesel fuel chemicals nasty funk almost an aroma that kind of burns your eyes
[04:48.570 --> 04:52.210]  It's kind of if somebody's got a bag of that in their pocket and they get in the car
[04:52.250 --> 04:54.250]  Your nose starts to crinkle you go
[04:54.410 --> 04:59.450]  Now you got that sour diesel on you and then your eyes start to feel it and then as soon as I smoke sour diesel
[04:59.450 --> 05:05.410]  Flowers I feel it in my eyes in my head and I love it one random note about the sour diesel
[05:05.410 --> 05:13.970]  I do not enjoy sour diesel concentrates. It just doesn't transfer. It doesn't translate in my opinion something happens when you make a concentrate that
[05:14.930 --> 05:16.930]  chemically skunky
[05:17.050 --> 05:22.690]  Diesel flavor doesn't come through the way it should in a concentrate most of the time. That is just my opinion
[05:22.690 --> 05:26.650]  I've never really enjoyed. I love the flowers. I love a good sour diesel flower
[05:27.450 --> 05:33.010]  Never been a big fan of any sour diesel concentrates. There's just something I've really noticed along the way
[05:33.250 --> 05:39.150]  Let me get back on track. So we've got a sour diesel and East Coast sour diesel across to a blueberry f4
[05:39.570 --> 05:44.630]  That's gonna be blueberry diesel turps. That's gonna be crazy amazing delicious good
[05:44.630 --> 05:47.650]  I can imagine only a good buzz from anything DJ short puts out
[05:48.270 --> 05:51.190]  DJ shorts a great breeder. Let me make a side note
[05:51.190 --> 05:57.430]  I am honored that you're choosing to use one of my strains to breed to one of DJ strains because DJ honestly is
[05:57.630 --> 06:01.270]  One of my heroes without DJ short there wouldn't be an IRI genetics
[06:01.270 --> 06:05.190]  He is one of the godfathers one of the pioneers one of the founders of cannabis breeding
[06:05.390 --> 06:09.070]  He taught me not directly his books his teachings his podcast
[06:09.150 --> 06:14.670]  Appearances his books mainly a lot of shit that he has said in magazines and books have taught me a lot of things and a
[06:14.670 --> 06:19.770]  Lot of ideas and have been springboards for ideas and tricks that I've learned up to where I am now
[06:19.770 --> 06:22.530]  So without DJ, I wouldn't be where I am
[06:22.530 --> 06:25.410]  I read genetics wouldn't exist Rasta Jeff wouldn't be where we are
[06:25.410 --> 06:31.610]  So big shout out big salute to DJ short and thank you for choosing to breed my scarlet to some DJ short work
[06:31.610 --> 06:34.870]  That's fucking awesome. Now. Let's get back on some sort of track here
[06:34.910 --> 06:39.330]  You're going to breed these scarlet begonias to the DJ shorts Navy Cross male
[06:39.670 --> 06:45.470]  And then it says now to make the strain stable. Do you keep finding the winners and in breeding them?
[06:46.510 --> 06:50.770]  In short form, it's not in breeding. It is filial breeding
[06:50.770 --> 06:54.970]  It's breeding for the next generation, but technically what you said is what you want to do
[06:54.970 --> 06:55.230]  Yes
[06:55.230 --> 06:55.790]  but
[06:55.790 --> 06:58.710]  when you say in breeding that implies that you are going to take
[06:59.030 --> 07:04.290]  One of the seeds that you made and breed it to one of the parent plants and that would be a back cross
[07:04.970 --> 07:07.970]  ABC or a BX if you want to make Pete's head explode
[07:08.490 --> 07:09.810]  That would be a back cross
[07:09.810 --> 07:10.970]  So what you want to do?
[07:10.970 --> 07:16.690]  You're on the right path you want to or what is done to stable and what is your what do you mean by stable?
[07:16.690 --> 07:22.010]  I see a lot of people say that plant is not stable and they mean that it's got tendencies to have
[07:22.130 --> 07:28.210]  Problems or it's got this or it does that stable just means do the plants look uniform when you grow out a population of seeds
[07:28.250 --> 07:32.850]  How uniform do they look are they stable are the the phenotype stable?
[07:32.850 --> 07:37.690]  That's what we want to talk about. So that's what I think you're aiming for. How do we make them stable?
[07:38.530 --> 07:44.250]  Sometimes that first f1 you're gonna get pretty stable crosses. You're gonna identify it
[07:44.250 --> 07:48.450]  You'll be able to identify the phenotypes. You'll see what you've made. You'll know what you're working with
[07:49.570 --> 07:53.450]  Now you've got that f1 batch of seeds or actually it's technically a polyhybrid
[07:53.610 --> 07:59.450]  But we're gonna call this an f1 batch of seeds. So you've taken your scarlet begonias. You have pollinated with the
[07:59.890 --> 08:03.730]  Navy cross you've got a batch of seeds you want to make them stable
[08:03.850 --> 08:08.330]  You find a male and a female from that batch of seeds that are the winners
[08:08.330 --> 08:12.130]  Like you said that have traits which you are looking for now
[08:12.130 --> 08:15.630]  Here is where we talk about the breeding part, which I always like to step in with
[08:15.810 --> 08:20.710]  What is your goal breeding is all about your goal. These are two great plants to cross
[08:20.710 --> 08:25.250]  I could see why it would be a good idea, but I can't see the plants which you have chosen to cross
[08:25.690 --> 08:28.850]  What is the reason what is the goal? What is the desired outcome?
[08:28.930 --> 08:34.890]  Is there something about the scarlet begonias you love? What about the DJ short plant that you really love?
[08:34.890 --> 08:37.650]  Are you trying to correct something you trying to upgrade something?
[08:37.650 --> 08:43.570]  Are you chasing a trait from one are you trying to combine traits to from one and the other to make one plant?
[08:43.570 --> 08:45.650]  What is your ultimate goal here?
[08:46.210 --> 08:51.290]  Document that goal then do the cross then grow out those seeds
[08:51.650 --> 08:57.570]  Find if you've met your goal do a certain percentage of the seeds you made hit the goal
[08:57.570 --> 09:00.930]  You're looking for are they better than both parent plants?
[09:00.930 --> 09:07.850]  Do they look smell taste grow appear perform the way you expected anticipated and hope those plants would if so
[09:07.970 --> 09:12.850]  You're mostly successful so far. If not, then you're not you're not successful. You didn't make a good cross
[09:12.850 --> 09:16.570]  You may have to just either pick another male plant out of the pack pick a different phenotype
[09:17.010 --> 09:22.210]  Start all over or just abandon the project altogether. So set a goal. What is your desired goal?
[09:22.770 --> 09:29.470]  What traits are you looking for so grow out these seeds find a female plant that holds the traits you are looking for find a
[09:29.470 --> 09:35.570]  Male plant that holds the traits you are looking for and cross those again and then guess what you're gonna get seeds out of those
[09:35.930 --> 09:38.810]  We're gonna do it again find a female that holds the traits
[09:38.810 --> 09:42.810]  You're looking for find a male that holds the traits you're looking for and cross it again
[09:42.810 --> 09:50.010]  Every time you do it, you should be working on stabilization and uniformity of the progeny of the offspring of the phenotypes
[09:50.010 --> 09:52.350]  They should look similar each time you do this
[09:52.350 --> 09:56.290]  They should get closer and closer and closer the first time you do the cross
[09:56.410 --> 10:02.570]  You're gonna get like probably you'll see somewhere between three maybe five maybe seven or eight different phenotypes
[10:02.570 --> 10:06.770]  Depending on the parent plants you use it just depends on how their genetics breed together
[10:07.170 --> 10:13.650]  You're gonna see multiple phenotypes when you do the f2 you're gonna see we call it the Pandora's box
[10:13.650 --> 10:16.290]  You're gonna open up a lot of stuff. You're going to see
[10:16.690 --> 10:22.650]  Plants that are a lot the mommy plants that are a lot the daddy plants are a little bit mommy and daddy
[10:22.650 --> 10:29.210]  But then you're also going to see grandparents on both sides of that cross appear in the progeny. It's going to be very fun
[10:29.210 --> 10:32.650]  It's really unique. It's a little bit frustrating sometimes to work with the f2
[10:33.490 --> 10:34.490]  population
[10:34.490 --> 10:39.250]  So now it's your job to select the proper male and female out of that f2
[10:39.490 --> 10:41.730]  Population breed them together and make the f3
[10:42.090 --> 10:46.890]  Now these are going to be if you've done your selection properly these will be more uniform
[10:46.890 --> 10:51.850]  They'll start getting more stable is the word that you're using. They'll start looking more uniform more familiar
[10:52.330 --> 10:58.170]  Get your f3s find the seeds that look beautiful that do what you want the plants that do what you want and cross those
[10:58.350 --> 11:01.970]  So that is you're going to f4 by the time you get to f4 f5
[11:02.010 --> 11:08.210]  You're really looking at uniform plants DJ stops at 4 or 5 most of the time and he says that is to give you some
[11:08.370 --> 11:11.770]  To work with it if you choose to breed with it if you breed
[11:12.450 --> 11:17.290]  With a plant that is an f4 or an f5. It's going to be very dominant in your mix
[11:17.290 --> 11:23.490]  It's gonna be like adding too much hot sauce. It's just gonna overpower everything everything will be spicy at that point so
[11:24.290 --> 11:31.330]  the easiest way the main way to do this is to keep going forward with filial generations and stabilize by
[11:32.130 --> 11:38.170]  Selection by finding the traits you want and selecting parent plants that perform and do the things you need and crossing them
[11:38.170 --> 11:45.890]  So if you select pot properly and keep going forward you will make them stable. It's just all about selection from population
[11:47.370 --> 11:52.370]  What becomes challenging with that is sometimes you see outliers and you want to play with the outliers do I want to breed with?
[11:52.370 --> 11:55.970]  The one that looks just like I wanted to play with or do I want to breed to that fucking weirdo?
[11:55.970 --> 12:00.450]  There's nothing stopping you from pollinating both of those plants and doing two separate lines and playing with it
[12:00.730 --> 12:05.670]  Now that I said two separate lines. Let's talk about a totally different process of doing this. I
[12:06.770 --> 12:09.290]  Don't know what your goal is, but maybe
[12:09.970 --> 12:16.090]  Maybe you want the flavor of the blueberry diesel and maybe you want the potency of the scarlet begonias
[12:16.090 --> 12:20.490]  I'm just making up traits and ideas for the sake of a podcast just to have a springboard to talk about here
[12:20.530 --> 12:21.770]  So you want one tree?
[12:21.770 --> 12:28.290]  I forgot what I even said now you want the the potency of the scarlet begonias and the flavors and aromas of the sour diesel
[12:28.290 --> 12:31.850]  blueberry cross the Navy Navy cross so
[12:32.570 --> 12:34.450]  You could in theory
[12:34.450 --> 12:35.970]  You could keep crossing
[12:35.970 --> 12:42.730]  Male and female and male and female and keep hoping you get that potency and that flavor keep hoping you get those traits find the female
[12:42.730 --> 12:49.610]  That's got both of those and keep crossing and keep crossing further and further until you've stabilized it or here is another idea
[12:50.130 --> 12:51.930]  You can breed two
[12:51.930 --> 12:55.810]  Separate lines you can breed the same. This is the same cross
[12:55.810 --> 13:03.330]  So you take the scarlet begonias you take your Navy cross and you make seeds now you find the male and female that you like
[13:03.330 --> 13:10.330]  That have the flavor the females got the flavor you're looking for and the male has got it's got the aromas
[13:10.330 --> 13:14.050]  It's gonna work good for breeding and you cross it to that female and you make the flavor
[13:14.250 --> 13:17.530]  profile and then you have to that for flavor and f3 that
[13:17.650 --> 13:23.610]  Focused on flavor the whole time all the way up to f4 or f5 and focus on just flavor
[13:23.850 --> 13:26.930]  Now you need a good grower you need a good structure you need a good shape
[13:26.970 --> 13:32.930]  But the main focus right now is whatever that flavor you're after focus in on that. I'm gonna say
[13:33.570 --> 13:38.010]  Blueberry diesel I can almost smell what a blueberry diesel. I've smoked blueberry headband
[13:38.010 --> 13:44.370]  It's probably quite similar that gassiness with the sweet blueberry to it with that fake blueberry muffin flavor on the exhale
[13:44.370 --> 13:51.130]  I can get that in my mind. So we're searching for that turp on the blueberry side of the cross now
[13:51.130 --> 13:54.890]  Let's get a totally different batch of seeds the same batch of seeds
[13:54.890 --> 14:00.690]  But a different selection of seeds and we're pulling out a male and female that breed for nothing
[14:00.690 --> 14:07.250]  But potency like they don't taste super good. They don't yield super fat, but it is potent every time you smoke it
[14:07.250 --> 14:10.230]  You got to call your mom. You got to be like bro. I'm too fucking high
[14:10.230 --> 14:12.490]  I can't find my keys and the keys are in your hand
[14:12.610 --> 14:15.610]  Like it's one of the looking for your sunglasses where you're fucking wearing them
[14:15.610 --> 14:20.070]  I got to turn down the music so that you could see the street signs better that kind of weed
[14:20.270 --> 14:22.990]  So breed for potency and then just go f2
[14:23.390 --> 14:28.350]  Potency f3 potency f4 potency and then by the time you get to f4 f5
[14:28.350 --> 14:33.630]  You've just bred these plants at every seed just makes highly ridiculously potent fucking plants
[14:33.630 --> 14:36.410]  So now on side a you have still got
[14:37.150 --> 14:39.150]  Scarlet begonias crossed to
[14:39.470 --> 14:43.710]  Navy cross on the other side you've still got scarlet begonias crossed a Navy cross
[14:43.710 --> 14:48.770]  But one line is nothing but turps and the other side is nothing but potency now
[14:48.770 --> 14:49.250]  Guess what?
[14:49.250 --> 14:53.210]  we get to do we get to find the correct progeny from each line and
[14:53.370 --> 15:00.330]  Cross those and then we get the amazing turps and the amazing potency and that is when we have got a true
[15:01.410 --> 15:06.550]  F1 hybrid that is when a true f1 is achieved at that point earlier
[15:06.550 --> 15:08.290]  I said that we're playing with poly hybrids
[15:08.290 --> 15:15.210]  That is a good way to wrap back to the poly hybrid part until you work it and stabilize it in such a manner
[15:15.370 --> 15:19.450]  It is just a poly hybrid at this point is a true f1
[15:19.450 --> 15:24.130]  You've worked the two lines for desired specific traits with a very specific goal in mind
[15:24.130 --> 15:26.330]  And then you have crossed the two in the end
[15:26.930 --> 15:34.530]  It is really a long process. It could be a lifeline a lifetime project, but there's no rush
[15:34.530 --> 15:35.810]  There's no hurry to do this
[15:35.810 --> 15:42.270]  DJ short has been at this since he was a very young man and he's my senior probably by I'm gonna give him ten years
[15:42.270 --> 15:45.870]  On me no disrespect DJ. We respect you cuz you're our elder
[15:45.870 --> 15:49.530]  I'm just saying DJ's been at it for a while. You've got your whole life to do it
[15:49.790 --> 15:54.570]  Don't try to fast-track it going fast will fuck you up. Take your time be patient
[15:55.090 --> 16:00.830]  Grow large numbers if you can large population will give you opportunity to find the plants you're looking for
[16:00.830 --> 16:03.270]  You can find the uniform plants. You can find the outliers
[16:03.830 --> 16:09.250]  You'll start being very familiar with them early when they start growing if you grow enough you'll go
[16:09.250 --> 16:12.490]  I don't even want these plants and you'll just start calling them. You know, these aren't for me
[16:12.890 --> 16:16.890]  This is not for the mix and you'll just start getting rid of it and you'll see it on both sides
[16:17.410 --> 16:22.050]  You'll be really really good at calling the plants that do not qualify for your breeding project
[16:22.170 --> 16:25.470]  All right. So let me make sure I answered all of that now to make the strain stable
[16:25.470 --> 16:27.470]  Do you keep finding the winners and inbreeding them?
[16:28.210 --> 16:31.730]  Inbreeding isn't the appropriate word, but you've got the right idea
[16:31.730 --> 16:36.210]  Yes, you'll have a batch of seeds out of the seeds find a male find a female breed them together
[16:36.210 --> 16:42.130]  Those will make more seeds find a male find a female out of those seeds and breed those together and just keep going forward
[16:42.130 --> 16:47.050]  If you want to do two separate breeding projects to isolate traits and then bring those together in the future
[16:47.050 --> 16:51.530]  That is a really beautiful project to really get a beautiful f1 hybrid
[16:51.790 --> 16:56.010]  So you did use the word inbreeding which isn't absolutely correct in this situation
[16:56.010 --> 16:59.450]  I understand what you are getting at but I'm just gonna talk about inbreeding briefly here
[17:00.010 --> 17:02.210]  Inbreeding is basically how we make a bat cross
[17:02.410 --> 17:08.530]  Inbreeding would be if we took any of the seeds and bred it to the parent which it came from in
[17:09.290 --> 17:11.930]  plant biology, it's okay to
[17:13.010 --> 17:16.330]  Breed brothers and sisters together. It's okay to breed anything together
[17:16.330 --> 17:21.290]  But breeding brothers and sisters together is more commonplace for moving the generations forward
[17:21.850 --> 17:27.570]  breeding a parent to one of the children is actually a bat cross and it's done mainly to
[17:28.170 --> 17:30.930]  Stabilize something like the bat cross I would do that
[17:30.930 --> 17:36.330]  If I didn't have if I wanted to make seeds of something which I only had a female of and I've talked about that plenty
[17:36.330 --> 17:36.970]  on other shows
[17:36.970 --> 17:44.210]  But that is that is inbreeding if you go a seed back to one of its parents is actually the inbreeding in cannabis
[17:44.210 --> 17:45.890]  That can be done a lot of different ways
[17:45.890 --> 17:49.930]  I just wanted to touch on what inbreeding actually was since you did use that word here in the message
[17:50.170 --> 17:54.010]  All right. I think I talked a lot about that topic. I hope I answered your question
[17:54.370 --> 17:59.410]  I really do enjoy talking about breeding. So if you've got any more breeding questions, please do send them to me
[17:59.930 --> 18:03.730]  patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart is the easiest method or
[18:04.330 --> 18:07.890]  Grow from your heart at hotmail.com who will get them to me as well
[18:07.890 --> 18:14.610]  All right. I do have another question here in front of me also big shout out to my buddy slightly stoned stupid 42
[18:15.290 --> 18:22.050]  Got another question. This one came from our friend red eye and it says I was also thinking about reversed feminized to feminized
[18:22.170 --> 18:29.770]  What would we be expecting? So this actually came from a part of another conversation. I just kind of clipped out this part feels unexplored
[18:30.370 --> 18:37.810]  Okay, so basically what they're asking about is if they crossed a reversed feminized plant to a feminized plant
[18:37.810 --> 18:39.810]  What would we be expecting?
[18:40.330 --> 18:46.490]  Basically, this is just reversing a female plant and crossing it to a female plant you can cross
[18:47.250 --> 18:50.810]  Feminized plants to non feminized plants to regular plants to
[18:51.250 --> 18:55.370]  Feminized to non however, you want to do it. It is possible people ask me a lot of times
[18:55.370 --> 19:00.930]  Is it okay to breed with feminized plants? Yes, absolutely. Is it okay to keep a feminized plant as a mother?
[19:00.930 --> 19:04.210]  Yes, absolutely. That is the same thing as a non fem plant
[19:04.210 --> 19:09.770]  The only difference was back in the the pollen stage. We determined that you would not get any males
[19:09.770 --> 19:15.710]  It was the pollen there was a male or a female that female pollen hit a female plant made female plants
[19:15.710 --> 19:20.830]  It's all the same as any other plant except it was guaranteed a female a good way to think about it
[19:20.830 --> 19:25.830]  And mr. Soul taught me this I'm not taking credit for this analogy, but think about it when you make feminized seeds
[19:26.310 --> 19:30.690]  Basically, we have learned how to put up a filter and when the males start shooting pollen
[19:30.690 --> 19:34.650]  We have learned how to suck out all of the male pollen out of the air out of the equation
[19:34.650 --> 19:40.790]  So that only female pollen will land on to our female plants that is not at all how the process happens
[19:40.790 --> 19:44.910]  But it's a very good analogy how to explain it. The only difference is the pollen
[19:44.910 --> 19:49.390]  We've learned how to take the male pollen out of the equation to create all female seeds
[19:49.550 --> 19:55.150]  So crossing reversed feminized to feminized. What would we be expecting that is basically?
[19:55.710 --> 20:01.790]  Making a self to plant the things to think about that would be a variable here is are we reversing?
[20:01.790 --> 20:05.270]  Well, it says a reversed feminized to feminized. Is it the same?
[20:05.790 --> 20:11.650]  Feminized plant like a golden goat. Let's just say I grew let's just say lemon Jeffrey
[20:11.650 --> 20:16.450]  That's a better example just for where I want to go with this lemon. Jeffrey is a feminized plant
[20:16.450 --> 20:18.770]  It's not available in regular seeds at all
[20:19.930 --> 20:25.050]  Let's say we use the painted lady cut of lemon Jeffrey. She's got a beautiful lemon Jeffrey cut
[20:25.050 --> 20:27.670]  So we take that painted lady cut of lemon Jeffrey. I
[20:28.490 --> 20:30.490]  reverse that one because it says a
[20:30.770 --> 20:36.810]  Reversed feminized so I reverse it treat it with silver thiosulfate. It is now making female pollen
[20:37.330 --> 20:42.450]  Do I pollinate that same another cut of the same lemon Jeffrey at that point?
[20:42.450 --> 20:48.650]  We're just going to expect more lemon Jeffrey. We have made an s1 that is a self version of that lemon Jeffrey
[20:48.650 --> 20:54.810]  It's gonna make pretty close to copies stable if you will copies of the original lemon Jeffrey
[20:54.810 --> 20:58.570]  There will be some differences. You will see a little bit of golden goat and some phenotypes
[20:58.570 --> 21:01.370]  You will see a little bit of the lemon skunk and some phenos
[21:01.530 --> 21:06.490]  Most of them are gonna look just like the mommy that I used to recreate it because of the
[21:06.890 --> 21:11.650]  Pollen donor and the pollen receiver basically the mommy and daddy of this plant were the same plant
[21:11.650 --> 21:15.090]  So it's gonna look like this plant very much so much of its genetics
[21:16.090 --> 21:23.250]  Mathematically are this plant you do like I mentioned have the opportunity to see that golden goat and to see that lemon skunk and also
[21:23.250 --> 21:29.890]  You're going to see weird outliers. That's just how genetics work. You're always gonna get some weird shit
[21:30.050 --> 21:34.850]  Expect it. That is how genetics work. No matter how hard the breeding is done. How much work is done?
[21:35.410 --> 21:41.530]  Nature loves to throw you some weird shit. That's nature's will to survive if we try to control it too much
[21:41.530 --> 21:46.850]  That's when it fucking fights back and it's like oh you think you got the breeding dialed in watch this and then you get some
[21:46.850 --> 21:49.890]  Weird fucking mutant plants. You had no idea. We're gonna come out so
[21:51.050 --> 21:53.050]  reversed feminized to
[21:53.050 --> 21:57.450]  Feminized we took that lemon Jeffrey. We reversed her we put her on more lemon Jeffrey
[21:57.450 --> 22:00.530]  We have now made a lemon Jeffrey s1
[22:01.170 --> 22:05.870]  Which is probably a little bit different than just when you do the golden goat to the lemon skunk
[22:05.870 --> 22:11.850]  You're gonna see variation there if we take that just the lemon Jeffrey now and reverse that one and hit the lemon Jeffrey again
[22:11.850 --> 22:13.930]  We're locking in those lemon Jeffrey traits
[22:13.930 --> 22:19.530]  We've washed out the opportunity to see lemon skunk and golden goat a little bit giving ourselves even more
[22:19.890 --> 22:25.350]  Opportunity to lock in that lemon Jeffrey trait. So if we did reverse feminized to feminized
[22:25.990 --> 22:29.350]  What would we be expecting so we've talked about if we pollinate the same thing
[22:29.350 --> 22:32.870]  What if we pollinate a different plant that is when we are doing?
[22:33.070 --> 22:36.990]  What I labeled what I was calling at some point and r1 or a reversal
[22:36.990 --> 22:41.190]  I will do an updated podcast on those labels because I have received a lot of feedback on that
[22:41.990 --> 22:46.850]  And yes, those were kind of terms made up by our by our industry by somebody in our industry
[22:46.850 --> 22:48.910]  But it works is why I tried to go with it
[22:49.350 --> 22:54.190]  Anyway, if you put that reversed lemon Jeffrey pollen on any other plant
[22:54.190 --> 22:57.270]  You are now making a new cross and it's going to work
[22:57.270 --> 23:03.510]  Just like if you put any other pollen on any other plant except it's going to be all
[23:03.910 --> 23:07.750]  Female and you're going to see let's say I'm just gonna pick a plant
[23:07.750 --> 23:12.150]  I have to pick a plant to put this pollen on we're going to put reversed lemon Jeffrey pollen on
[23:12.990 --> 23:16.670]  Let's just put it on the chem de la chem because that sounds fucking amazing, right?
[23:16.670 --> 23:22.710]  Lemon Jeffrey to chem de la chem what it's not happening. So don't get too excited, but it sounds fucking beautiful
[23:22.950 --> 23:26.590]  So now we've got the reversed lemon Jeffrey and we're putting it on
[23:26.990 --> 23:32.990]  Chem de la chem pollen or on a chem de la chem female that wouldn't work because that one's not feminized
[23:32.990 --> 23:37.650]  They want to do to a feminized. So let's put that on something feminized orange chasm
[23:37.650 --> 23:39.990]  Let's throw that on the orange chasm. Now you have made
[23:41.150 --> 23:46.610]  Orange chasm cross to lemon Jeffrey. That is a new hybrid. That's gonna be lemon oranges craziness
[23:47.050 --> 23:49.170]  Unfortunately, they both have golden goat in the mix
[23:49.170 --> 23:51.770]  So you're gonna get a lot of golden goat in the progeny there
[23:51.770 --> 23:53.490]  But that wasn't that's beside the point
[23:53.490 --> 23:56.050]  The point here is that you're just going to make a new hybrid
[23:56.050 --> 24:00.450]  It will be just like if you were to put any other plant in a room and pollinate any other plant
[24:01.090 --> 24:08.410]  But since you're using a feminized starter plant all of the offspring all of the progeny all of the seeds will be female
[24:09.210 --> 24:11.210]  I'm gonna say that
[24:11.410 --> 24:16.490]  99.9% of them will be female because like I said nature does love to fuck with you
[24:16.490 --> 24:22.170]  No matter how good the breeding is done. It is possible to find a male a full-on nutty
[24:23.010 --> 24:26.970]  Her sex plant anything wrong. I don't know if I need to edit that word out or not
[24:26.970 --> 24:29.490]  Um, I may if you hear a bleep right there
[24:29.490 --> 24:32.410]  You know what word I edited out because YouTube may get on me for that word
[24:34.610 --> 24:40.650]  It won't be an intersex plant it won't have male and female parts it will be a straight-up full-on male
[24:40.650 --> 24:47.330]  That is an opportunity to come from feminized seeds. It is one in a million or one in I'm gonna say
[24:47.330 --> 24:51.730]  I don't know one in a hundred thousand or something like that, but it is possible. I've seen it happen
[24:51.730 --> 24:53.730]  I know another breeder who has had it happen
[24:53.770 --> 25:01.130]  I've seen a breeder breed with a male that came from feminized stock and that makes a lot of females
[25:01.130 --> 25:05.690]  It does put off some male plants, but most of the offspring are female
[25:05.690 --> 25:10.690]  So it is possible no matter how good the breeding is done. Those plants are going to do what they want
[25:10.690 --> 25:14.970]  Just like Jurassic Park bro life does find a way
[25:15.170 --> 25:20.370]  We can't do everything to make the plants perfect every time we do our best through selection. So, um
[25:21.530 --> 25:27.270]  Let's see. Where were we crossing reversed to feminized? We talked about that or reverse feminized to feminized
[25:27.270 --> 25:30.890]  I wanted to talk about hitting the reverse pollen to a
[25:31.250 --> 25:36.690]  The same female to a different female the same time you're making self plants the second way you're just making
[25:37.130 --> 25:40.090]  Our ones reverse plant basically making new hybrids
[25:40.090 --> 25:46.690]  I think I answered that one unexplored had to try it not very unexplored. All the breeders are doing that
[25:48.090 --> 25:51.130]  Some people don't even realize that a what if you get a clone
[25:51.130 --> 25:55.290]  What if somebody passes you a clone of lemon Jeffrey and you just decide to breed with it?
[25:55.290 --> 25:59.690]  You probably didn't even think if that lemon Jeffrey came from a feminized seed stock
[25:59.690 --> 26:05.930]  You just have the clone. You probably don't even think about if the original plant came from a fem seed or a regular seed
[26:05.930 --> 26:07.210]  So a lot of people are doing that
[26:07.210 --> 26:12.950]  They're just out there breeding with fem stock with reg stock and they're not even thinking about it until this episode now
[26:12.950 --> 26:16.970]  They're gonna put thought into it. They're gonna fuck everything up because now they're aware of it
[26:16.970 --> 26:20.450]  They're gonna stumble over themselves and trip over their own dicks. That's just how people get
[26:21.090 --> 26:25.770]  But it's not very unexplored. I've been exploring it. I got experience in there
[26:26.290 --> 26:30.210]  So crossing reverse feminized to feminized you're just gonna get great
[26:30.490 --> 26:33.330]  Feminized offspring if you do it, right you get great shit
[26:33.330 --> 26:39.090]  If you do it to wonky plants that haven't been tested if they have problems if they're prone to throw nanners
[26:39.090 --> 26:40.690]  I'm trying to avoid that one word
[26:40.690 --> 26:45.210]  I said a moment ago the H word because we have a friend who got their channel flagged for saying the H word as hate
[26:45.210 --> 26:49.490]  Speech we're actually talking about intersex plants here. Please don't flag us
[26:50.050 --> 26:56.050]  But if they're prone to do that the offspring will do that as well so be careful with your selection selection is
[26:56.610 --> 27:01.410]  Key. All right. I want to send a big. Thank you to my buddy red. Eye. Thank you for the great question
[27:01.410 --> 27:07.730]  I hope I answered you because I feel like I got super rambly. All right. I've got another great email here in front of me
[27:07.770 --> 27:12.970]  Let's not ramble too much. Let's get right into this one. Oh, that's not the one we need for the show
[27:13.730 --> 27:18.930]  Actually here is it's on the bottom. Of course. Here is the one I wanted to read on this episode
[27:18.930 --> 27:21.770]  I'm not going to read the whole message because it is
[27:22.530 --> 27:26.810]  Quite long and we can get to the point kind of quickly here without reading all of this
[27:26.810 --> 27:32.310]  This one came from our friend Debo buds. This did come from the I read genetics website
[27:32.310 --> 27:34.810]  There is a grow help tab on the I read genetics website
[27:34.810 --> 27:38.810]  If you go to I read genetics calm, you will see the grow help tab. Click on there
[27:38.810 --> 27:42.090]  We ask you a few a few preliminary questions
[27:42.090 --> 27:46.210]  We ask you what name you would like to be called on the podcast in case I do read your message
[27:46.210 --> 27:51.570]  Big shout out to our buddy Debo buds getting their message right here. We ask you what strain you're growing while you're growing it
[27:51.570 --> 27:56.730]  What kind of lights just a few basic questions to help me help you. So let's get right into it
[27:57.090 --> 28:04.470]  This one is from our buddy Debo buds. They're growing a random seed indoor under LED. They're in flower. They're five weeks in
[28:05.170 --> 28:08.410]  They their last feed was a five gallon res
[28:09.170 --> 28:11.210]  With 19 mils, let's see
[28:12.170 --> 28:16.210]  Okay, they've broken down every mil of every nutrient we don't need to read all that they're feeding
[28:16.850 --> 28:23.190]  Botanic care cow mag advanced nutrients since he bloom a and B bud blood a quarter scoop of great white
[28:23.810 --> 28:26.390]  PPM or EC of the last feeding 1200
[28:26.390 --> 28:30.610]  I think for what you're putting in there that seems a little bit low and for week five of bloom
[28:30.650 --> 28:31.770]  That's a little bit low
[28:31.770 --> 28:37.690]  There should be a couple other things in here the daytime temps are fine night temp temps are fine. No reports on humidity
[28:38.210 --> 28:43.810]  So I'm gonna read part of this and we may end up editing this because this is kind of long
[28:43.810 --> 28:47.130]  We don't need to review all of this here, but it does go on to say what's up
[28:47.130 --> 28:53.570]  You bad motherfucker on my last flower run, which was my first flower ever during hydroponics. I made several mistakes
[28:53.570 --> 28:56.810]  Yes, that is going to happen. But owning up to those mistakes is very important
[28:57.130 --> 29:02.770]  It says at the time I was doing half strength of the recommended feeding as I as it was working
[29:02.770 --> 29:08.250]  Well in veg, so I continued that same pattern when flipping to flower all was well until week five
[29:08.490 --> 29:11.890]  So they're doing the recommendation a lot of times we say
[29:12.410 --> 29:18.490]  Podcasters people who teach you about growing we say that you only need to use about half strength of what a nutrient company
[29:18.610 --> 29:24.610]  Recommends on the bottles because they do want you to buy more and you can always add something to your plants
[29:24.610 --> 29:26.050]  But you can't take nutrients out
[29:26.050 --> 29:31.650]  So start off at half strength see what the plants are doing if they're responding like they're hungry if they want more of something you
[29:31.650 --> 29:32.450]  Can give it to them
[29:32.450 --> 29:35.890]  But if they're acting like they're being burnt or overfed then you know
[29:35.890 --> 29:40.130]  You need to reduce it start off weaker work your way up dial it in figure it out from there
[29:40.130 --> 29:44.170]  So our friend here was following good advice going about it the right way. They were feeding
[29:44.690 --> 29:49.810]  Half strength nutrients and they were happy with it. The plant seemed happy until week five
[29:49.810 --> 29:53.510]  It says then week five. I let's see
[29:53.510 --> 29:59.450]  I noticed the PPM of the runoff was going up every day like they quit eating. So I added fresh
[29:59.850 --> 30:01.650]  5.5 pH water
[30:01.650 --> 30:06.610]  That water pH was way too low. You're pissing the plants off only to top off the res midweek
[30:06.610 --> 30:08.850]  But the runoff each day continued to climb
[30:09.050 --> 30:12.470]  So after two days, I dumped the res and started to flush with
[30:13.010 --> 30:18.750]  RO with RO water with the pH of five point six and then for the rest of the week
[30:18.750 --> 30:24.850]  I just watered with our water at a regular cycle watching the PPM drop back down from 1200 to
[30:25.290 --> 30:27.570]  1850 so you were getting a runoff of
[30:28.090 --> 30:30.090]  Of
[30:31.170 --> 30:36.570]  1850 okay. I continue this for a week and never dropped under 1200. I called the manufacturer
[30:36.570 --> 30:38.850]  Okay. Now I've got a couple of things to mention already
[30:39.850 --> 30:41.410]  Did the plants look okay?
[30:41.410 --> 30:47.690]  We didn't talk about what the plants looked like you just said then in week five you notice that the PPMs were way off
[30:50.010 --> 30:54.370]  You don't mention that the plants looked upset are you growing pH meters
[30:54.370 --> 30:58.130]  Are you growing EC meters or are we growing plants if the plants looked angry?
[30:58.130 --> 30:59.210]  You didn't include that here
[30:59.210 --> 31:04.450]  So I don't know but if you're just changing things up and doing random chaotic shit to your plants
[31:04.810 --> 31:11.330]  Because of a meter and the plants didn't say anything about it. Don't do that. Don't do that. The plants are the boss
[31:11.330 --> 31:17.230]  We're not growing meters. We're not growing monitors. We're not growing programs. We're not trying to make the fucking charts happy
[31:17.230 --> 31:22.530]  We're trying to make the plants happy. I love all of my toys my equipment my meters. It makes life easy
[31:23.410 --> 31:29.930]  But those aren't what I paid the most attention to I pay attention to the plants I know what the plants need
[31:29.930 --> 31:36.090]  I watch the plants do they look happy then I make a mental note of what parameters those plants enjoy
[31:36.090 --> 31:41.730]  I know that these plants like it about 82 degrees. They like it about 60% relative humidity
[31:41.730 --> 31:45.170]  They like a little bit of wind in here. They like it when I water them this often
[31:45.210 --> 31:50.870]  So then I set up devices that will tell me when those parameters are being met or when they're not being met
[31:50.870 --> 31:56.630]  I don't pay too much attention to the room to the equipment to the runoff to the pH coming out of the plants
[31:56.630 --> 31:59.310]  I watch the plants and if they're angry
[31:59.310 --> 32:04.110]  They'll tell me and then I can start checking my monitors my meters looking at reports
[32:04.110 --> 32:06.150]  I can see Oh a couple of days ago
[32:06.150 --> 32:10.230]  It got really hot in here and I can see that today they're acting a little bit goofy or a few days ago
[32:10.230 --> 32:13.870]  The runoff on the pH was a little bit high and now they're acting goofy. Now we can react
[32:13.870 --> 32:16.510]  I don't look at runoff numbers and say the numbers are wrong
[32:16.510 --> 32:21.190]  We have to change something as soon as you start doing that you fuck up the plants watch the plants
[32:21.190 --> 32:24.110]  They will tell you so that is the main thing to start with
[32:25.790 --> 32:29.370]  Yeah, you don't mention that the plants were mad you just say that the numbers were wrong
[32:29.370 --> 32:32.390]  so you changed it then you said you called the manufacturer and tech support and
[32:32.630 --> 32:39.390]  Got reprimanded for only using half of what they recommend my notes on my page straight-up say fuck that guy if somebody
[32:39.830 --> 32:42.990]  Reprimanded you for using their product the wrong way. Fuck that guy
[32:42.990 --> 32:47.210]  And again, I've only got to go by what you said and you said they reprimanded you
[32:47.210 --> 32:51.550]  So my if I called a company and I was like, hey, I need help with your product and they reprimanded me
[32:52.230 --> 32:57.890]  Fuck that company. I would never give them another dollar of my hard-earned money. They wouldn't even hear from me
[32:57.890 --> 33:01.550]  They wouldn't even I wouldn't even take the energy to talk shit about them on a podcast
[33:01.550 --> 33:08.810]  They I would just forget they even existed and the brand you're talking about until you brought them up. I basically forgot they existed anyway
[33:09.330 --> 33:15.710]  Let's keep moving so dude don't let a nutrient company reprimand you for doing anything wrong if they had good quality customer service
[33:16.010 --> 33:22.070]  They would are they what they should do is take you by your hand and guide you through it and do it the proper way
[33:22.070 --> 33:26.090]  That is their job if they want to call themselves customer service. That is the way to do it
[33:26.090 --> 33:31.750]  What they did was a dick move. That wasn't cool at all. That is not customer service. That's that's an ego problem
[33:32.050 --> 33:35.450]  That's that's that's a being a control freak and have an ego problem
[33:35.610 --> 33:42.170]  If you want somebody to use your product you don't reprimand that I don't think you should reprimand them if I wanted if you were
[33:42.170 --> 33:46.090]  Called me and you're like dude. This product isn't working. I'd say well, let's figure it out
[33:46.090 --> 33:48.670]  And I'd have a phone call with you and we talked about what did you do?
[33:48.670 --> 33:53.130]  Well, here's where you went wrong. Here's how you can fix it. Call me in a week. We'll see how it's going
[33:53.130 --> 33:56.690]  I wouldn't reprimand you like that's not the way shit works
[33:56.690 --> 33:59.970]  I hope you don't give them any more of your money abandon ship with those guys is my
[34:00.170 --> 34:04.790]  Vote with your dollars is what Scotty rule would tell us so it goes on but men
[34:04.790 --> 34:09.590]  I think I've answered most of your questions really dude. I'm gonna read a little bit more of this, but honestly
[34:10.350 --> 34:14.690]  One of your mistakes was adjusting due to numbers don't adjust due to numbers
[34:14.690 --> 34:17.110]  The bottom line is the plants are the boss in this whole situation
[34:17.310 --> 34:23.810]  Not the investors not the owner of the facility not the IRS guy not city planning and zoning
[34:23.990 --> 34:28.370]  not the consultant not the lead grower not the grow tech not the trimmer not the
[34:28.670 --> 34:31.670]  The compliance person none of those people are the boss
[34:31.670 --> 34:36.950]  They all like to think they are we all like to think we are the plants are the boss the plants dictate
[34:37.510 --> 34:42.630]  Everything in that place you should make a schedule for the plants and you should have some some stuff like that
[34:42.630 --> 34:47.550]  They can't write the rules and the schedules and they can't go get food, but they are the boss
[34:47.550 --> 34:53.630]  So let them be the boss. I do want to read more of this. But when you said you got reprimanded dude, that's frustrating
[34:53.630 --> 34:58.030]  Don't ever let a manufacturer reprimand you you should call them back and tell them that Rasta Jeff said to go fuck yourself
[34:58.750 --> 35:03.310]  Then says I didn't think it was right either, but I'm not gonna argue with them. I'm still learning
[35:03.310 --> 35:07.030]  Okay, so they did tell you to use it full strength. I'm learning I didn't know better than them
[35:07.390 --> 35:12.630]  Then the PPM stayed high then they started to drop again and the plants are now showing sign of flushing
[35:12.630 --> 35:16.110]  Well, yeah, you've been doing so much to him now that those plants are just gonna be angry you're in
[35:16.630 --> 35:19.190]  If you're in any sort of hydro like that, they they do
[35:19.670 --> 35:23.830]  They show you results very quickly and you've done a lot to them. So they've been beat up
[35:24.430 --> 35:26.430]  I'm already let's see
[35:26.910 --> 35:29.450]  Figured I'd switched PPM to EC on the next run
[35:29.450 --> 35:33.290]  Oh, yeah using a different scale may I messed you all up to when I check the trichomes during all this time
[35:33.290 --> 35:38.110]  They turn from clear to some milky and some seem to have stalled out. Your plants are confused. Yes
[35:38.670 --> 35:43.070]  I'm gonna read more of this to myself really quickly and we'll see if we can help you out anymore or if we've covered the
[35:43.070 --> 35:45.390]  Important parts harvest in time to move on
[35:45.950 --> 35:47.950]  Sometimes that's the best way to do it, dude
[35:47.950 --> 35:49.270]  cut it down and
[35:49.270 --> 35:55.230]  Take note of what you did and learn from it and know what to do and what not to do next time a lot of
[35:55.230 --> 35:58.870]  Learning is learning what not to do next time you if you get everything, right?
[35:58.870 --> 36:02.790]  Every time think about it like if you're a skateboarder or if you're doing some extreme sport
[36:02.790 --> 36:04.790]  You're out there on a fucking freestyle bike or a motorcycle
[36:05.110 --> 36:10.170]  If you nail the trick the first time every time you're never gonna learn anything. You're gonna get a big head
[36:10.170 --> 36:13.490]  You're gonna get a big ego and then when it comes time to perform in the X Games
[36:13.490 --> 36:17.390]  You're gonna get nervous and you're not gonna be able to do the basic tricks because you've been out there doing stale fish
[36:17.590 --> 36:20.350]  360s can't even fucking kickflip, right? So
[36:20.870 --> 36:25.470]  Yeah, learn you got to learn from your mistakes crash and burn and hurt yourself is where I was trying to head
[36:25.470 --> 36:30.390]  Fall down get some road rash break a couple bones and then you'll learn I don't need to do that shit again
[36:30.390 --> 36:32.670]  And you'll learn that I got to put my foot here. I got to put my foot here
[36:32.670 --> 36:35.550]  You'll start landing your tricks. That's where I was trying to go with all that nonsense
[36:36.110 --> 36:41.070]  There's a lot to this message, but you've harvested this message came in a while back
[36:42.430 --> 36:44.430]  my main point of this dude is
[36:45.150 --> 36:46.350]  Don't grow meters
[36:46.510 --> 36:53.190]  Don't grow meters don't adjust too much to the meters and then don't ever let a nutrient company representative talk down to you
[36:53.190 --> 36:55.110]  I don't know who you are
[36:55.110 --> 37:01.170]  But nobody should ever reprimand you nobody maybe your mama or daddy, but that's the only persons
[37:02.030 --> 37:04.950]  Maybe you're married to sorry. Let's see. I
[37:06.510 --> 37:07.670]  Don't have page two of this
[37:07.670 --> 37:11.310]  Anyway, there was a second page to this but I feel like I have answered most of this question
[37:11.310 --> 37:15.070]  This one actually came to us quite a while ago. So that crop has been harvested
[37:15.070 --> 37:19.270]  I did want to make sure to read that because when you said you were reprimanded by the
[37:19.590 --> 37:21.590]  representative of that grow company it definitely
[37:21.750 --> 37:26.670]  It made me frustrated so I want to come on here and just make sure that you stand up for yourself next time and
[37:27.150 --> 37:32.590]  My main point is don't grow meters. We're not growing meters. We're not growing EC meters. We're not growing
[37:32.590 --> 37:35.350]  I love all my toys. Don't get me wrong. I always talk about that
[37:35.350 --> 37:38.430]  I know my friends that give me meters and make programs and stuff
[37:38.430 --> 37:41.390]  They're going come on use the meters I do but they're not the boss
[37:41.390 --> 37:44.950]  the plants are the boss the meters are what I use to as
[37:45.270 --> 37:49.950]  Markers and indicators if I've got a problem, then I go to the meters the plants say something's wrong
[37:49.950 --> 37:50.630]  I look at them
[37:50.630 --> 37:57.110]  I can usually identify a problem but I can use the meters the programs the notes to kind of back up my claims if I have
[37:57.110 --> 38:01.190]  To go to a facility owner and say hey, I think this is happening. We need to spend money on this
[38:01.270 --> 38:03.590]  They say prove it and I go the plants showed this
[38:03.710 --> 38:10.110]  The status shows this report show this and this piece of equipment shows this I've isolated the problem to this they go
[38:10.110 --> 38:14.270]  That's good work. We'll order the product you think I don't just go. Hey, the plants are looking like this
[38:14.270 --> 38:19.190]  We got to add cow mag and they go. Oh, how do you know that and I go cuz they're showing little rusty spots, dude
[38:19.270 --> 38:20.990]  They go. No, let's look at the reports
[38:20.990 --> 38:25.070]  Let's look at some shit and let's fucking back that claim up with something. Then we adjust the cow mag
[38:25.590 --> 38:29.590]  Alright, I did want to make sure to get that one answered because it did come in quite a ways ago
[38:29.590 --> 38:31.790]  I feel like I rambled through that one quite a bit
[38:31.790 --> 38:37.670]  But one of your problems is that you're mixing brands. It looks like you were doubling up on your base nutrients in this also
[38:38.190 --> 38:44.350]  Use a more reputable brand use a brand that didn't reprimand you I would recommend using new Millennium bottled nutrients
[38:44.350 --> 38:46.030]  They don't pay me to say that but they're good people
[38:46.030 --> 38:50.390]  They've got great customer service and a lot of my teachings are based on using their products
[38:50.390 --> 38:55.910]  So if you're using them, you can follow along very easily with me. It's very easy to understand that way
[38:56.270 --> 38:58.270]  but don't let anyone reprimand you and
[38:59.270 --> 39:02.470]  Grow from your heart watch the plants. Don't worry so much about the meters
[39:02.470 --> 39:06.070]  All right, ladies and gentlemen boys girls pamps hose friends foes
[39:06.070 --> 39:12.870]  Smokers growers clone cutters pollen chuckers all you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there. That is all I've got for you for this episode of the show
[39:12.870 --> 39:16.750]  I want to thank you again for hanging out if you have any questions corrections comments or concerns
