[00:18.810 --> 00:21.330]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:21.330 --> 00:24.690]  It's time for episode number 200 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.850 --> 00:29.090]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:29.090 --> 00:30.930]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.970 --> 00:33.010]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:33.410 --> 00:36.450]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:36.470 --> 00:40.090]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:41.370 --> 00:43.290]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:43.290 --> 00:45.770]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:45.810 --> 00:48.570]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:48.570 --> 00:52.170]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:52.570 --> 00:54.890]  Koot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:58.370 --> 01:03.370]  Happy 420 everybody. This episode is coming out on 420, April 20th of 2017.
[01:04.410 --> 01:06.210]  Thank you for joining me for 420.
[01:07.770 --> 01:11.130]  I will be at work on 420 at 420, but I guarantee you,
[01:11.370 --> 01:14.210]  we will be taking a smoke break or wait, maybe we won't.
[01:14.770 --> 01:18.130]  Depends on who you are. If you're the boss, we're not taking a smoke break.
[01:18.170 --> 01:22.050]  If you're the MED, if you're OSHA, we will be in the building working for 420.
[01:22.810 --> 01:26.130]  If you're a podcast fan, we'll be dabbing the fuck out for 420.
[01:26.170 --> 01:28.450]  It'll be a good ass time. Ladies and gentlemen, happy 420.
[01:28.450 --> 01:30.450]  If you can't tell them already high as shit, it is 419.
[01:30.450 --> 01:34.290]  I'm recording the day before 420, obviously Wednesday, 419.
[01:34.530 --> 01:38.530]  I've been smoking some grateful dog shatter. I had some golden goat shatter in my
[01:38.530 --> 01:41.330]  hand. I've got a joint the size of a small baseball bat.
[01:42.010 --> 01:44.650]  This thing is going to get several people stoned out of their minds.
[01:44.650 --> 01:46.730]  That this should be a good time. Whenever this gets lit up.
[01:47.010 --> 01:50.130]  Thank you for joining me for episode 200. This is a great lineup. You guys,
[01:50.130 --> 01:53.010]  this is episode number 200 on 420.
[01:53.250 --> 01:56.250]  And also we've been recording this podcast for what I believe has been
[01:56.250 --> 01:58.570]  approximately two years. So it's a great celebration.
[01:59.650 --> 02:01.690]  Thank you for listening, everybody. Thanks for being here for 420.
[02:01.690 --> 02:04.530]  I hope you're smoking on something. Take some time to roll up a joint,
[02:05.090 --> 02:07.690]  roll up a blunt. If that's what you got to do. I'm not really a big fan of blunts.
[02:07.690 --> 02:11.090]  I think we grow really quality cannabis and then to watch you guys grind it up
[02:11.090 --> 02:12.730]  and put it into a blunt, it's kind of heartbreaking.
[02:13.370 --> 02:16.770]  That blunt tastes like shit to me here. Grape flavored blunt wrap.
[02:16.770 --> 02:17.890]  What the fuck is with that?
[02:18.130 --> 02:20.970]  Those berry flavored blunt wraps that you guys are smoking. It smells terrible.
[02:20.970 --> 02:23.610]  It makes my lips feel funky. Cannot deal with that.
[02:23.610 --> 02:25.570]  I don't know how you guys do it, but if you're smoking a blunt,
[02:25.570 --> 02:29.130]  more power to you go for it. Do it. Smoke that blunt. Just not for me.
[02:29.490 --> 02:31.330]  I've heard hopefully, I know people are going to say,
[02:31.330 --> 02:33.690]  but you run butane over your weed and destroy it. You're right.
[02:33.730 --> 02:36.570]  Turns it into golden sweet shatter. That doesn't taste like funky.
[02:36.930 --> 02:40.890]  Like I'm smoking incense. Whatever you're doing. Smoke a blunt with me.
[02:40.890 --> 02:43.970]  Smoke a dab, smoke some shatter, smoke some live resin, smoke some rosin.
[02:44.450 --> 02:46.490]  Whatever you got, smoke it up. You got some sauce.
[02:46.530 --> 02:50.170]  Take a dab and pass it over to me. I'd love a dab of that shit right about now.
[02:50.850 --> 02:53.730]  Hey guys, I am Rambly. This is going to be a short quick episode.
[02:53.730 --> 02:56.450]  I just wanted to jump in and take some dabs and hang out with everybody for 420
[02:56.450 --> 02:59.250]  so that we could feel like we spent some time together on the National Stoner
[02:59.250 --> 03:02.410]  Holiday. Since this is a cannabis based podcast.
[03:03.130 --> 03:04.210]  Since I'm doing shout outs and stuff,
[03:04.210 --> 03:06.530]  let me start off with something really, really serious here.
[03:06.770 --> 03:10.490]  Huge thanks to everybody who has contributed and supported me on Patreon.
[03:10.490 --> 03:11.330]  That is amazing.
[03:11.730 --> 03:15.450]  Recently I had a couple of sizable contributions that really helped me move my
[03:15.450 --> 03:18.810]  project forward. I appreciate that. It helps with all the new equipment.
[03:18.810 --> 03:20.730]  You'll notice that there is a video for this episode.
[03:20.730 --> 03:22.050]  It won't be up for a long time,
[03:22.210 --> 03:24.610]  but I am recording a video of this right now onto the iPad.
[03:24.930 --> 03:26.690]  I'm running the recording gear.
[03:26.930 --> 03:30.170]  I ran a headphone out into a device called the iRig 2.
[03:30.170 --> 03:31.570]  I'm running iRig into the iPad.
[03:31.570 --> 03:35.330]  The iPad is recording a video that will have this microphone quality sound
[03:35.330 --> 03:37.730]  coming through it. So in the future there will be video of this.
[03:37.730 --> 03:39.330]  I'm trying to get all the videos up on YouTube.
[03:39.770 --> 03:41.330]  It is a lot of work you guys, but anyway,
[03:41.690 --> 03:43.930]  thanks to the people who have contributed on Patreon.
[03:44.090 --> 03:47.290]  If you're not aware of Patreon, let me tell you what Patreon is.
[03:47.810 --> 03:49.290]  Patreon is a service that allows,
[03:49.610 --> 03:53.010]  that allows my listeners to contribute financially to the podcast.
[03:53.330 --> 03:57.610]  If you want to learn more, you can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[03:57.810 --> 04:00.090]  All the information that you need will be right there. You can sign up,
[04:00.090 --> 04:01.970]  you can create an account and then you can contribute.
[04:02.250 --> 04:05.330]  What will happen is you can sign up to contribute one time or you can sign up
[04:05.330 --> 04:08.250]  for a subscription. If you sign up for a one-time contribution,
[04:08.530 --> 04:13.610]  whatever amount you decide to type in, if it's $1, if it's $9, if it's $9,999,
[04:13.890 --> 04:16.650]  if you sign up for a one-time contribution on the first of the month,
[04:16.650 --> 04:19.890]  that one-time contribution will roll through and that will be deposited into my
[04:19.890 --> 04:23.450]  PayPal account. If you decide to do a subscription every month,
[04:23.490 --> 04:25.570]  whatever amount you decided to contribute,
[04:25.810 --> 04:29.050]  that will be rolled from your card into my PayPal account once a month.
[04:29.330 --> 04:31.970]  I'm not trying to get rich. I'm not asking you guys to pay my rent.
[04:31.970 --> 04:33.770]  I'm not asking to buy me a new car.
[04:34.050 --> 04:36.250]  What I am trying to do is offset the cost of my website.
[04:36.250 --> 04:38.290]  It does cost me a little bit of money to have a website,
[04:38.450 --> 04:42.450]  which is where I host the show. Honestly, you guys, my website sucks.
[04:42.490 --> 04:45.410]  It's a mess. It's terrible. I am not a web guy.
[04:45.650 --> 04:48.730]  I haven't put any time or energy or effort into that website. It is there.
[04:49.410 --> 04:52.690]  Kind of. It's nothing impressive. I apologize. I'm embarrassed,
[04:52.890 --> 04:54.290]  but I don't have the resources or the,
[04:54.290 --> 04:56.810]  I don't know how to do that and I'm not going to take the time to learn.
[04:57.730 --> 05:00.690]  It'll get fixed. My buddy that does, it's been tied up. He's a new dad.
[05:01.330 --> 05:05.450]  He'll get to it. Yeah. But anyway, so the, the website hosts, the podcast,
[05:05.450 --> 05:08.850]  the podcast is then dumped into all of the other services like iTunes,
[05:08.850 --> 05:11.610]  Stitcher, pod bay, feed burner, wherever else it goes.
[05:11.610 --> 05:13.450]  It goes to a lot of places where people can listen to it,
[05:13.650 --> 05:15.170]  but it does cost money to have the website.
[05:15.170 --> 05:19.290]  So the funds that you guys contribute to my Patreon go directly to my PayPal.
[05:19.290 --> 05:22.370]  And then that goes directly to my web hosting and it covers the cost of my web
[05:22.370 --> 05:25.890]  hosting. Once the web hosting is covered, what I will do with the funds,
[05:26.010 --> 05:28.410]  I'm making sure I didn't press a button here. I just moved my iPad. Cool.
[05:28.410 --> 05:29.290]  We're good. We're still recording.
[05:29.810 --> 05:32.690]  What I plan to do with those funds is cover things like this iPad that I bought.
[05:33.650 --> 05:36.410]  And then also it will cover more toys for the iPads.
[05:36.410 --> 05:38.810]  I want to add some accessories to it and there'll be upgrades.
[05:38.810 --> 05:40.730]  I buy these little foam covers for the microphones.
[05:41.130 --> 05:43.330]  That'll be part of what the Patreon covers.
[05:43.650 --> 05:46.010]  But if you'd like to contribute or if you'd like to know more,
[05:46.050 --> 05:50.450]  simply go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart and all the information will
[05:50.450 --> 05:54.450]  be right there. And thank you everybody that contributed. If it was $1,
[05:54.450 --> 05:56.370]  if it was more than that, thank you. I appreciate it.
[05:56.730 --> 06:00.090]  Also if you did not contribute, if you're listening to this podcast right now,
[06:00.090 --> 06:02.690]  if you're hearing my voice, thank you. I appreciate you.
[06:03.050 --> 06:06.010]  You do not have to contribute financially for me to appreciate you.
[06:06.650 --> 06:09.210]  Your listens mean the world to me. Just being part of my community,
[06:09.210 --> 06:13.410]  being part of my team here, uh, being involved in this. That's awesome. Thank you.
[06:13.410 --> 06:15.410]  You don't have to give me money for me to be your friend.
[06:15.530 --> 06:18.410]  I like you for listening. I like you for who you are. You look good today,
[06:18.450 --> 06:20.930]  by the way. Has anyone told you that you look fucking great today.
[06:21.330 --> 06:25.930]  All right guys who can tell I'm high as giraffe pussy. I am, I'll admit it.
[06:26.010 --> 06:28.250]  So I've been talking about the, uh, the dude grows cut.
[06:28.250 --> 06:30.490]  Big shout out to my friends at the dude grow show. Uh,
[06:30.490 --> 06:33.050]  the dude and Scotty real, the whole crew, the dude grows crew,
[06:33.050 --> 06:36.570]  a bunch of great folks. I'm honored to be a part of that. A little crew there.
[06:37.010 --> 06:38.450]  I went to the dude grows cup.
[06:38.730 --> 06:42.050]  I did not tell you guys who the winners were because I left before that
[06:42.050 --> 06:44.530]  happened. Honestly, I was exhausted. I had to work the next day.
[06:44.530 --> 06:48.890]  I had to drive 130 miles back home. Uh, so I left anyway,
[06:48.930 --> 06:51.530]  on the next episode of the dude grows that I listened to, uh,
[06:51.570 --> 06:55.650]  they announced the winners. I was excited. You guys, I'm going to go through,
[06:55.650 --> 06:57.490]  these are just the flower winners is all I've got here.
[06:57.490 --> 06:59.410]  I did not list the concentrate winners,
[07:00.170 --> 07:04.170]  but here are the flower winners from the dude grows cup that happened on April
[07:04.170 --> 07:07.490]  15th of 2017. I don't know when you're listening to this,
[07:07.530 --> 07:10.210]  hopefully on four 20 with me dabs up if you are,
[07:10.330 --> 07:11.930]  but here are the winners from the dude grows cup.
[07:11.930 --> 07:16.610]  Third place for best flower voted by the, uh, the attendees of the event.
[07:17.090 --> 07:21.930]  A third place lemon Jeffrey from Irie genetics. I did not grow it.
[07:21.930 --> 07:24.570]  I did not enter it. Apparently a guy named Cole,
[07:24.570 --> 07:27.890]  who is a well-known grower in Denver that grows for a large dispensary,
[07:27.890 --> 07:29.770]  a well-known large dispensary in Denver,
[07:30.410 --> 07:34.090]  a guy named Cole grew some lemon Jeffrey and he entered it into the dude grows
[07:34.090 --> 07:39.010]  cup. And it won third place. Congrats. Shout out and much love to Cole. Hey,
[07:39.010 --> 07:40.090]  Cole, if you're listening to this,
[07:40.090 --> 07:44.770]  or if anybody can reach out to Cole and have him contact me and don't just go
[07:44.770 --> 07:47.610]  trolling and act like you're cold, but Cole, I've got a present for you.
[07:47.730 --> 07:49.010]  All you gotta do is get in touch with me.
[07:49.090 --> 07:52.090]  I'd like to put some things in your hands. Uh, thank you. Great work.
[07:52.090 --> 07:55.370]  Congratulations. And, uh, yeah, man, I've got a gift for you.
[07:55.370 --> 07:58.170]  So please do get in touch. If the dude grows crew can, uh,
[07:58.170 --> 08:01.010]  put him in touch with me somehow, I would appreciate that. Uh,
[08:01.010 --> 08:04.290]  and also big shout out to the dude grows crew for the relationship that we've
[08:04.290 --> 08:04.530]  built.
[08:04.530 --> 08:07.370]  I think it's really cool that we've got two podcasts serving two different
[08:07.370 --> 08:10.330]  audiences and one joined audience. And there's no,
[08:10.810 --> 08:13.090]  I don't feel intimidated by them. They're not intimidated by me.
[08:13.130 --> 08:15.610]  It's fucking awesome that we've built this community and this connection and
[08:15.610 --> 08:18.850]  this bond. Uh, let's get back on track. Some highest shit. Uh,
[08:18.850 --> 08:23.250]  second place in the dude grows cup was purple elephant grown by a guy who calls
[08:23.250 --> 08:25.130]  himself Stoney Jack four 20.
[08:25.370 --> 08:27.970]  So shout out to Stoney Jack four 20 with the purple elephant.
[08:28.370 --> 08:31.890]  They said that the difference in second and third place was actually one vote.
[08:31.930 --> 08:36.370]  There were 35 and 34 votes for second and third place. So one vote split it up.
[08:36.730 --> 08:39.490]  So if you go to a cannabis event and you were able to vote,
[08:39.810 --> 08:42.690]  just like in politics fucking vote, cause your vote counts. Uh,
[08:42.690 --> 08:46.530]  I might not have a third place winning strain. If you would have voted differently,
[08:46.530 --> 08:49.490]  that's how it goes. So one vote is all it would have taken to knock me out of
[08:49.490 --> 08:52.770]  there. Uh, not me personally. I bred the strain. I can't take too much credit.
[08:52.770 --> 08:55.570]  I made the seeds. Once those seeds left, I don't know what happened to them.
[08:55.650 --> 09:00.210]  Apparently a coal grew the shit out of it. Good work. So first place, uh,
[09:00.730 --> 09:05.210]  first place got over 50 votes that it was everybody's favorite strain. Uh,
[09:05.210 --> 09:08.770]  first place was a strain called Brandy wine grown by a person who calls
[09:08.770 --> 09:13.050]  himself Van Ripster. I have not met Van Ripster, but I hope to one day,
[09:13.170 --> 09:16.610]  great work. Nice grow, uh, much respect for winning the dude grows cup.
[09:16.610 --> 09:19.450]  So third place, lemon, Jeffrey, second place, purple elephant,
[09:19.450 --> 09:23.170]  and first place Brandy wine grown by Van Ripster.
[09:24.090 --> 09:26.970]  Excellent works. Everybody at the dude grows cup. It was a great event.
[09:26.970 --> 09:29.010]  I had a good time. You guys, uh,
[09:29.290 --> 09:33.210]  get ready cause I'm going to enter some shit next year. That's right.
[09:33.210 --> 09:34.930]  I drove up there and I had a good time and I partied.
[09:34.930 --> 09:36.770]  Why in the fuck didn't I enter something?
[09:37.570 --> 09:41.130]  I'd have a cup sitting on this table right now. You guys. Uh, so dude, Scotty,
[09:42.010 --> 09:45.490]  get ready. Cause I'm entering next year. Stoney Jack, uh, get ready.
[09:45.810 --> 09:48.890]  Van Ripster get ready. Cole, talk to me and get ready.
[09:49.010 --> 09:50.330]  Cause I'm coming for you next year. You guys,
[09:50.610 --> 09:52.250]  I'm going to be in this damn dude grows cup.
[09:52.530 --> 09:55.250]  There's no reason for me to drive up there and hang out with everybody and not
[09:55.250 --> 10:00.050]  bring some cannabis to enter. Right. All right. Uh, I can't wait. So, uh,
[10:00.090 --> 10:02.770]  you know, it was missing from the dude grows cup, Bo,
[10:02.810 --> 10:05.370]  you've got to be up here next year with us. That's all that was missing.
[10:05.410 --> 10:06.650]  You got to come. So Bo Nellis,
[10:06.650 --> 10:10.010]  I look forward to seeing you at the dude grows cup next year with the whole crew.
[10:10.010 --> 10:11.770]  It would be a great podcast experience.
[10:14.290 --> 10:15.010]  All right, you guys,
[10:15.010 --> 10:17.490]  I've got one question for you that I want to ask everybody that's listening.
[10:17.490 --> 10:19.450]  I might have two or three questions. Once I start rambling,
[10:19.450 --> 10:21.770]  you never know how it goes with me. I wanted to keep this episode short,
[10:21.770 --> 10:23.690]  but yeah, that might not happen.
[10:23.730 --> 10:26.330]  I want to know what you're listening to when you're smoking down.
[10:26.330 --> 10:30.210]  What kind of music do you like to jam? Obviously I like reggae music. Uh,
[10:30.330 --> 10:33.450]  I like Morgan heritage. I like steel pulse. I like Marlon Asher.
[10:33.450 --> 10:37.010]  I like stuff like that. Uh, of course I am a huge grateful dead fan.
[10:37.130 --> 10:40.810]  Uh, like any of the grateful dead stuff, uh, all of the grateful dead stuff,
[10:40.810 --> 10:45.370]  mostly, but stuff from like 1977 is kind of my favorite. If you're a deadhead,
[10:45.850 --> 10:50.050]  the Betty boards from may of 77, the Northeast coast tour.
[10:50.050 --> 10:53.530]  That's some of my favorite shit ever. Uh, 72 is good.
[10:53.530 --> 10:56.650]  Some of that acoustic stuff from 72, uh,
[10:56.810 --> 11:00.210]  the West coast stuff from the early years is great, but the grateful that you,
[11:00.250 --> 11:03.610]  obviously you guys don't have a fucking grateful dead fan. 72, 74, 77.
[11:03.610 --> 11:05.410]  That's my favorite grateful dead shit right there.
[11:06.330 --> 11:09.250]  But then I think if somebody asked me what my favorite band was,
[11:09.250 --> 11:12.210]  I would probably have to flip a coin that day and see what kind of mood I'm in.
[11:12.210 --> 11:15.130]  It's either fish or the grateful dead. I'm a huge fish fan also.
[11:15.130 --> 11:17.530]  So when I'm getting blazed, I like to listen to fish,
[11:17.570 --> 11:22.970]  the grateful dead or good reggae. Um, and honestly, when I was younger, uh,
[11:23.170 --> 11:27.530]  I was a huge metal head. I liked the, uh, not, not super heavy. Matt. Well, yeah,
[11:27.530 --> 11:32.450]  I got it. I, I dabbled into the super heavy shit for a little while, but, uh,
[11:32.570 --> 11:35.690]  I was into like Metallica, Pantera, mega death, stuff like that.
[11:35.690 --> 11:38.570]  I kind of into the Pearl jam side of stuff, but more on the metal,
[11:38.610 --> 11:40.970]  less grungy side, the more metal side of stuff.
[11:40.970 --> 11:44.850]  So occasionally when we're working at the grow and things are dragging, uh,
[11:44.850 --> 11:47.730]  yesterday morning, everybody had a hard time getting fucking started.
[11:47.730 --> 11:50.130]  So I fired up Metallica radio, uh,
[11:50.170 --> 11:53.370]  and just the kick drum and cymbals and snare drum fucking going.
[11:53.770 --> 11:56.850]  Everybody was working at an acceptable pace after a couple of songs.
[11:56.850 --> 11:59.250]  So that's what I like to listen to. If I need to get it fired up,
[11:59.250 --> 12:01.890]  which isn't very often, if I really need to get moving, I'll put on Mo.
[12:01.890 --> 12:04.130]  I think Mo is like super high energy,
[12:04.130 --> 12:07.770]  maybe some government mule if I need to wake the fuck up. But so I really,
[12:07.770 --> 12:11.050]  rambled about music, fish, Mo the grateful dead, uh,
[12:11.650 --> 12:15.090]  reggae music, of course, widespread panic. Occasionally. Uh,
[12:15.170 --> 12:18.530]  I used to listen to a lot of panic. It's just nostalgic to me, I guess. Uh,
[12:18.570 --> 12:21.410]  always some good Jerry Garcia stuff. That's always some of my favorites.
[12:21.810 --> 12:23.930]  So I want to know what you guys are listening to. Send me a tweet,
[12:23.930 --> 12:26.970]  send me an email. If you want to tweet me, it's at GFYH podcast.
[12:26.970 --> 12:29.970]  If you want to email me, of course it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[12:30.210 --> 12:33.410]  I want to know what music you're listening to when you're getting blazed. Also,
[12:33.530 --> 12:35.370]  just cause it's fun to know what people are doing.
[12:35.410 --> 12:37.490]  What are your favorite snacks after you get high?
[12:37.850 --> 12:40.170]  And if you take a couple of fat dabs and your mouth starts doing that,
[12:40.850 --> 12:42.450]  and your stomach goes raw,
[12:42.690 --> 12:44.770]  what's the kind of shit you want to walk to the fridge for?
[12:44.810 --> 12:46.530]  Or what do you want to drive to seven 11 and get?
[12:46.890 --> 12:49.930]  I want to know what kind of snacks you like to get down on. I'm pretty simple.
[12:49.970 --> 12:53.930]  I like cold Dr. Pepper in a bottle, fresh, cold Dr. Pepper in a bottle.
[12:53.970 --> 12:56.650]  I want it to go when I crack it open. Uh,
[12:56.810 --> 12:59.770]  that's like my favorite shit and many kinds of snacks. I'm good.
[12:59.810 --> 13:03.250]  It just, I prefer crunchy over sweet. I think most of the time,
[13:03.370 --> 13:06.970]  most of the time, but not always. Um, yeah, that's just my,
[13:07.010 --> 13:08.770]  my snack preferences. I'm curious.
[13:08.810 --> 13:11.050]  Let me know what you're snacking on once you get blazed.
[13:11.250 --> 13:13.330]  So I don't know what you're listening to. I want to know what you're snacking on.
[13:13.330 --> 13:14.970]  I want to, I want to be friends with you guys.
[13:14.970 --> 13:18.890]  Also tell me what you're smoking on for four 20 everybody. It's four 20 tweet me.
[13:18.970 --> 13:21.370]  Let me know what you're smoking. Email me and let me know what you're smoking.
[13:21.370 --> 13:24.330]  I want to know what strain you're smoking. I want to know how you're smoking it.
[13:24.410 --> 13:27.770]  You got flowers. Do you have dabs? You got live resin. Let me know what's going on.
[13:28.170 --> 13:30.570]  If you care to let me know, if you're not in an illegal state,
[13:30.570 --> 13:33.450]  let me know where you purchased it. If you got it at a dispensary, uh,
[13:33.450 --> 13:35.850]  let me know which dispensary and let me know what you think of it.
[13:35.850 --> 13:39.530]  Also that's a fun thing to do. So you can be like, I'm smoking. Like right now,
[13:39.730 --> 13:42.210]  as soon as I start playing the music to fade out the podcast,
[13:42.210 --> 13:47.010]  I'm going to take a dab of grateful dog shatter through a hit man rig with a
[13:47.010 --> 13:48.690]  quartz nail on it, a quartz banger.
[13:48.850 --> 13:53.010]  And the flowers were grown by me and the product was extracted by our friend,
[13:53.010 --> 13:56.570]  the barefoot extracts. Um, I also may take care.
[13:56.570 --> 13:58.250]  This is better because this came from a dispensary.
[13:59.010 --> 14:02.810]  I may dab some lemon Jeffrey batter from apothecary.
[14:02.850 --> 14:03.850]  That's who extracted it.
[14:04.450 --> 14:08.290]  And I purchased it at a place called elevate in Colorado Springs elevated,
[14:08.330 --> 14:12.250]  sorry, elevated in Colorado Springs. So give me that kind of info.
[14:12.290 --> 14:14.410]  If you want to let me know what you're smoking. I would love to know.
[14:14.410 --> 14:16.810]  Once again, it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com,
[14:16.810 --> 14:20.130]  or you can tweet me at GFYH podcast. Or if you're on the Facebook,
[14:20.490 --> 14:22.810]  just go to the Facebook page. Of course it's grow from your heart.
[14:23.490 --> 14:26.210]  Let me know what you're smoking on. Let me know what you're listening to.
[14:26.490 --> 14:29.690]  And then let me know what you're going to snack on after you get nice and
[14:29.690 --> 14:33.210]  blazed for four 20. You guys have been rambling for like 15 minutes.
[14:33.330 --> 14:35.770]  I usually stop and take a drink and take a couple of dabs right about now,
[14:35.770 --> 14:38.570]  but I think I'm just going to wish everybody a happy four 20.
[14:38.730 --> 14:42.450]  And I am going to take a couple of dabs while the music plays.
[14:42.450 --> 14:43.850]  And I hope you were dabbing with me.
[14:44.490 --> 14:46.970]  I would take a fat dab right now while we're recording,
[14:46.970 --> 14:49.050]  but I'm just going to cough and it's just going to be kind of a waste of
[14:49.050 --> 14:51.490]  recording space. So know that when I hit play on the ending music,
[14:51.970 --> 14:56.570]  that I'm taking fat dabs and that it's time for you to give your mom a hug.
[14:56.570 --> 14:58.450]  I haven't even thought about what song I'm going to play at the end here.
[14:58.450 --> 15:01.090]  I think we're going to play ganja farmer by Marlon Asher.
[15:01.090 --> 15:04.370]  It seems like a very appropriate song and I bet I could find it on my phone
[15:04.370 --> 15:07.690]  pretty quickly to make it happen. I am recording a video also.
[15:07.690 --> 15:08.930]  I'm not going to record the video.
[15:09.250 --> 15:11.770]  I probably will not record the audio unless I fuck up right now,
[15:11.770 --> 15:14.970]  trying to find this song, which I'm searching for.
[15:14.970 --> 15:18.130]  Just bear with me for just a couple of seconds. Let me turn this down.
[15:18.130 --> 15:20.370]  So don't screw up on you and make something go crazy.
[15:21.010 --> 15:23.810]  We're typing in ganja and it doesn't find ganja farmer.
[15:25.010 --> 15:27.570]  It's really weird how the iPhone works sometimes. Hey, look what I found.
[15:27.570 --> 15:30.250]  There's a song called ganja farmer. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[15:30.250 --> 15:32.850]  I want to thank everybody for listening to episode 200.
[15:32.850 --> 15:34.610]  I can't believe it. 200 episodes. You guys,
[15:34.610 --> 15:37.210]  I know I'm kind of cheating because I've been putting out those long episodes,
[15:37.210 --> 15:40.530]  but there's still some work to those two. So it counts, man. There's, there is,
[15:40.570 --> 15:43.690]  there are 200 episodes. I think it counts. It's official.
[15:43.690 --> 15:45.610]  So thank you for listening to 200 episodes.
[15:45.610 --> 15:48.370]  Thanks for tolerating me for what I think has been about two years.
[15:48.890 --> 15:53.690]  I hope everybody has a huge safe, exciting, stony as fuck for 20.
[15:53.690 --> 15:56.930]  I hope your eyes get super red. I hope everybody makes it through it.
[15:57.690 --> 16:01.570]  If you're going to an event to be an activist, don't be stupid. Don't go to jail.
[16:02.410 --> 16:04.770]  Don't cause any problems. Be respectful of the plant.
[16:04.770 --> 16:08.050]  Represent this plant in a very respectful, respectable way.
[16:08.410 --> 16:11.650]  We are ambassadors to the cannabis plant. We represent this plant,
[16:12.210 --> 16:14.650]  represent it in a good way. Don't be a dipshit, please.
[16:15.410 --> 16:18.290]  That's my serious note for this four 20, please. If you're out there,
[16:18.610 --> 16:21.810]  do it responsibly. You're going to be on the news. Think about it.
[16:21.810 --> 16:25.010]  Whenever you're doing whatever you're doing, picture the news story in your head.
[16:25.170 --> 16:28.490]  How's it going to go? Dipshit drives car into wall or dipshit.
[16:28.490 --> 16:29.770]  It's not going to say dipshit on the headline,
[16:29.770 --> 16:31.490]  but that's how you're going to feel when you read it. And it's about you.
[16:31.810 --> 16:35.330]  Dipshit does something dumb to put a black eye on the marijuana scene.
[16:35.490 --> 16:37.970]  You don't want that. You don't be that guy. All right. All right.
[16:37.970 --> 16:39.530]  I love you guys. Hope you have a great four 20.
[16:39.530 --> 16:42.650]  I want to give a huge shout out to everybody who is smoking with me today on
[16:42.650 --> 16:46.170]  four 20. I'm going to play some reggae music. I feel like a DJ when I do this,
[16:46.190 --> 16:49.370]  but this song is from Marlon Asher and it's called Ganja Farmer.
[16:49.490 --> 16:51.490]  Everybody has a happy four 20 and until next time,
[16:51.490 --> 16:54.130]  take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[17:26.920 --> 17:27.920]  Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

[18:10.920 --> 18:12.920]  deep down in the earth where me put me ganja
[18:12.920 --> 18:14.920]  Babylon come
