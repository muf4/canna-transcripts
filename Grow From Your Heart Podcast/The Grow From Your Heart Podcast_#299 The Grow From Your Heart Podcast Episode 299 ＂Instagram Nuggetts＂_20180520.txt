[00:01.720 --> 00:07.720]  Yo, what's up podcast world? It's time for a bonus episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.720 --> 00:11.720]  This episode is a compilation of clips from my Instagram live videos.
[00:11.720 --> 00:19.720]  That's right, on Instagram I'm irie underscore genetics, I-R-I-E underscore G-E-N-E-T-I-C-S,
[00:19.720 --> 00:24.720]  iriegenetics on Instagram. I've been going on Instagram live and hanging out with my Instagram friends
[00:24.720 --> 00:29.720]  and talking about cannabis and I thought it would be a really good idea to turn on a microphone
[00:29.720 --> 00:32.720]  and capture some of my rants and use them for the podcast.
[00:32.720 --> 00:36.720]  So, here are some highlights from my Instagram live feeds.
[00:36.720 --> 00:40.720]  And once again, I encourage you to follow me on Instagram and catch all of my live videos.
[00:40.720 --> 00:43.720]  Maybe I will answer your questions on a live feed.
[00:43.720 --> 00:47.720]  Make sure you check me out, it's irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[00:47.720 --> 00:55.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's get down with the Instagram live feed podcast bonus episode.
[00:55.720 --> 01:00.720]  Alright, so the question was, what are the benefits and drawbacks of bigger oil rig versus a smaller oil rig?
[01:00.720 --> 01:05.720]  A small oil rig makes sense to me. I'm using a small Hitman rig right now. It's really small.
[01:05.720 --> 01:13.720]  Most people would say that's really small. The reason I like it small is because I'm not trying to fill this chamber with smoke and carve it like we used to do with the bomb.
[01:13.720 --> 01:17.720]  I want my smoke to go from the nail, down this tube, into the water to cool it.
[01:17.720 --> 01:21.720]  And then I want that smoke in my lungs, in my head, punching me as quick and hard as possible.
[01:21.720 --> 01:26.720]  I don't need a big chamber filled with smoke because that's the point of a bomb with a bomb.
[01:26.720 --> 01:32.720]  You light it and you suck and suck and suck until this big old glass area, the whole area is filled with smoke.
[01:32.720 --> 01:35.720]  Then you pull the carb and then you get a bunch of smoke with oil.
[01:35.720 --> 01:41.720]  You don't really need that because as soon as you hit the oil onto the nail and put a carb cap on there, you're getting plenty of smoke.
[01:41.720 --> 01:44.720]  You're going to get it all. So that's not necessary.
[01:44.720 --> 01:53.720]  And I don't like a big rig because I'm not trying to inhale a gallon of oxygen or a liter of oxygen before I even start getting my dab into me.
[01:53.720 --> 01:58.720]  I just want to breathe in the dab. With this little rig, there's no resistance and hesitation.
[01:58.720 --> 02:04.720]  Basically, as soon as my dab touches this nail, the smoke is in my lungs.
[02:04.720 --> 02:09.720]  And it goes through the water just enough to get cooled and then it goes into me. And that's what I want.
[02:09.720 --> 02:14.720]  I don't need a whole bunch of extra glass for the resin to stick to and steal my dab.
[02:14.720 --> 02:16.720]  I don't need to suck in a whole bunch of extra oxygen.
[02:16.720 --> 02:21.720]  And I'm not trying to get a big old smoky fill and then pull it and carve it.
[02:21.720 --> 02:25.720]  It's all coming to me right at once because I've got a little rig and I'm not smoking flowers.
[02:25.720 --> 02:30.720]  I'm going to smoke all of it. With flowers, you're going to smoke until that chamber is full.
[02:30.720 --> 02:32.720]  And then you think that's as much smoke as I can handle.
[02:32.720 --> 02:36.720]  And then you carve it and then you put the ball back in and you pass it to the next dude and he gets a rip unless you're doing snaps.
[02:37.720 --> 02:40.720]  But basically, there's no need to get that big-ass chamber of smoke.
[02:40.720 --> 02:43.720]  So I like a small rig. This right here is perfect to me. This is a Hitman.
[02:43.720 --> 02:47.720]  It's called the Hammerhead because of the perk inside there. The perk goes straight down.
[02:47.720 --> 02:51.720]  It splits out left and right. It bubbles out of the sides. It's a Hammerhead perk.
[02:51.720 --> 02:55.720]  It's a sidecar. It's really small. It's compact. It fits in a cup holder.
[02:55.720 --> 02:58.720]  This is the size rig I think is perfect.
[02:58.720 --> 03:03.720]  So that's my rant on benefits and drawbacks of bigger versus smaller rigs.
[03:03.720 --> 03:06.720]  Smaller is better. I'm not trying to fill up a whole bunch of space with smoke.
[03:06.720 --> 03:09.720]  And I'm not trying to smoke a whole bunch of air before I get my dab.
[03:09.720 --> 03:12.720]  I want to take a dab right to the head. So there you go. That's my rant on that.
[03:12.720 --> 03:13.720]  Thanks for that good question.
[03:20.070 --> 03:22.070]  How long do you heat the glass part?
[03:24.070 --> 03:26.070]  It depends on which glass part you're using, honestly.
[03:26.070 --> 03:29.070]  It depends on how thick it is and what size it is.
[03:29.070 --> 03:31.070]  I've got two different nails right here.
[03:31.070 --> 03:35.070]  This one I have to heat for about a count of 45 or 50.
[03:35.070 --> 03:40.070]  This one here, I only give this one a 35 to 45 count.
[03:40.070 --> 03:42.070]  They're just two different styles.
[03:42.070 --> 03:47.070]  Then I let it cool until I feel like it's right.
[03:47.070 --> 03:49.070]  I go hotter than most people.
[03:49.070 --> 03:52.070]  The best way to do it is to practice. Heat it up, let it cool.
[03:52.070 --> 03:54.070]  Heat it up until it kind of glows.
[03:54.070 --> 03:57.070]  And then set a timer and count 45 seconds. Then hit it.
[03:57.070 --> 04:01.070]  If you feel it was too hot or too cold, set your timer for 30 or a minute. Try again.
[04:01.070 --> 04:03.070]  And just see where you like it.
[04:03.070 --> 04:05.070]  There's no perfect temp for dabbing.
[04:05.070 --> 04:08.070]  People say there is a perfect temp or this is the perfect temp.
[04:08.070 --> 04:09.070]  I think it's personal preference.
[04:09.070 --> 04:12.070]  I like kind of a hot dab because I like a big dab.
[04:12.070 --> 04:15.070]  There's something about the lung expansion part that I feel in my lungs that I enjoy that.
[04:15.070 --> 04:17.070]  That's part of what I'm looking for.
[04:17.070 --> 04:19.070]  A lot of people like to take really cold dabs.
[04:19.070 --> 04:21.070]  And when you do that, you waste a lot of it.
[04:21.070 --> 04:23.070]  And then you got to get a Q-tip and clean it out.
[04:23.070 --> 04:24.070]  And I think that's kind of silly.
[04:24.070 --> 04:26.070]  I'm not here to clean shit up.
[04:26.070 --> 04:29.070]  I'm not here trying to smoke to waste it, to taste it.
[04:29.070 --> 04:31.070]  I'm here to get high. That's my mission.
[04:31.070 --> 04:33.070]  It's medical. It's recreational.
[04:33.070 --> 04:35.070]  It helps me out mentally, physically, spiritually.
[04:35.070 --> 04:37.070]  I want to consume it. I don't want to waste it.
[04:39.790 --> 04:42.790]  At least you talk about interesting topics. You know your stuff. Keep up.
[04:42.790 --> 04:44.790]  Hey, thank you, man. That's a great compliment.
[04:44.790 --> 04:46.790]  Now defend why you like it hot.
[04:46.790 --> 04:48.790]  Because I do, bro. Because I do.
[04:48.790 --> 04:50.790]  There's something about that lung expansion.
[04:50.790 --> 04:53.790]  Something about that feeling. It takes your breath away.
[04:53.790 --> 04:57.790]  It makes you, I don't know, it kind of makes your body go into shock maybe a little bit.
[04:57.790 --> 04:58.790]  I'm not sure.
[04:58.790 --> 05:07.790]  There's something about that feeling of, it's a mixture of a stroke, an orgasm, a heart attack, a panic attack, and bliss.
[05:07.790 --> 05:09.790]  And ecstasy for a couple of seconds.
[05:09.790 --> 05:12.790]  Just, oh fuck. And I appreciate that sort of a thing.
[05:12.790 --> 05:14.790]  It's adrenaline. There's adrenaline in that also.
[05:14.790 --> 05:19.790]  Because you're not supposed to get that much smoke at that heat in your body at that one time.
[05:19.790 --> 05:20.790]  I don't think.
[05:20.790 --> 05:22.790]  And so my body goes, ooooh.
[05:22.790 --> 05:25.790]  And there's something that comes with the high also with that that I just enjoy.
[05:25.790 --> 05:27.790]  That's my defense for it, Nick. Good question.
[05:27.790 --> 05:30.790]  And just because I do, bro. Because I do.
[05:30.790 --> 05:31.790]  Glow Squad.
[05:33.790 --> 05:35.790]  You've been thinking about switching rigs.
[05:35.790 --> 05:36.790]  I would go with something kind of small.
[05:36.790 --> 05:38.790]  And you don't have to go expensive either.
[05:38.790 --> 05:43.790]  If you're going to buy a rig, make sure that when you draw through it, that it doesn't put water in your mouth.
[05:43.790 --> 05:45.790]  Watch. I'm going to hit it semi-hard.
[05:45.790 --> 05:47.790]  And hopefully I don't get water in my face.
[05:47.790 --> 05:48.790]  Because that's the main thing.
[05:49.790 --> 05:54.400]  You're not even going to dab through it that hard.
[05:54.400 --> 06:00.400]  So as long as you can put water in it to get bubbles and not get water in your mouth, that's an important thing to think about.
[06:00.400 --> 06:01.400]  And then is it comfortable?
[06:01.400 --> 06:03.400]  Hold it up to your face and think about dabbing it.
[06:03.400 --> 06:04.400]  Is it going to work?
[06:04.400 --> 06:05.400]  That's what I would do.
[06:06.400 --> 06:08.400]  Your drying process in a home grow.
[06:08.400 --> 06:10.400]  I've got a whole episode about drying and curing.
[06:10.400 --> 06:13.400]  But quick rant about drying and curing.
[06:13.400 --> 06:14.400]  Here's how I would do it.
[06:15.400 --> 06:18.400]  Drying and curing actually starts a few days before harvest.
[06:18.400 --> 06:20.400]  I would go in and pull off all the big leaves.
[06:20.400 --> 06:22.400]  All the fan leaves.
[06:22.400 --> 06:23.400]  Anything with a petiole.
[06:23.400 --> 06:24.400]  Anything that's hanging off.
[06:24.400 --> 06:26.400]  Anything you can snap off with your finger.
[06:26.400 --> 06:27.400]  Anything with a purple stem.
[06:27.400 --> 06:30.400]  A lot of the larger leaves have now got purple stems at the end of flower.
[06:30.400 --> 06:31.400]  Snap all those off.
[06:31.400 --> 06:33.400]  Anything you can cut off without scissors.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.400]  Just go in there with your fingers and pull it off.
[06:34.400 --> 06:36.400]  Then let the plants finish.
[06:36.400 --> 06:38.400]  On the day you plan on harvesting, go in there and cut them down.
[06:38.400 --> 06:39.400]  Hang them upside down.
[06:39.400 --> 06:42.400]  Let them hang until the sticks pop.
[06:42.400 --> 06:44.400]  You want the stems to snap when you bend them.
[06:44.400 --> 06:47.400]  You don't want them to explode with dryness.
[06:47.400 --> 06:49.400]  You don't want them to be pow and then they fall apart.
[06:49.400 --> 06:51.400]  You want them to just go crunch when you bend them in half.
[06:51.400 --> 06:53.400]  If they don't make a crunchy noise, they're not dry enough.
[06:53.400 --> 06:55.400]  Some are going to be real wet when you start.
[06:55.400 --> 06:56.400]  They'll be rubbery.
[06:56.400 --> 06:58.400]  They're going to be real juicy.
[06:58.400 --> 06:59.400]  Let them go until they pop.
[06:59.400 --> 07:00.400]  Crunch.
[07:00.400 --> 07:04.400]  Now when they pop, then you can cut the buds off of the sticks.
[07:04.400 --> 07:08.400]  You can put them into an airtight container.
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.400]  I use a lot of different things.
[07:09.400 --> 07:11.400]  I was going to grab something, but it's over there out of reach.
[07:11.400 --> 07:13.400]  Put the buds into an airtight container now.
[07:13.400 --> 07:16.400]  Now you can start trimming them at will.
[07:16.400 --> 07:18.400]  Whenever you need to trim some buds, dump them out on the table.
[07:18.400 --> 07:19.400]  Trim them up.
[07:19.400 --> 07:20.400]  Put them into the next jar.
[07:20.400 --> 07:22.400]  That next jar is where your trim buds go.
[07:22.400 --> 07:25.400]  Now you're drying and curing them in that jar at the same time.
[07:25.400 --> 07:28.400]  When the sticks pop, get them into the jar.
[07:28.400 --> 07:34.400]  Then make sure you open that jar frequently because you do not want them to start getting funky in there.
[07:34.400 --> 07:39.400]  Once you get them into the jar, open it up depending on how moist they are when they go in there.
[07:39.400 --> 07:41.400]  Honestly, it's going to depend.
[07:41.400 --> 07:44.400]  I would open them up about two hours after you put them in there and feel them.
[07:44.400 --> 07:45.400]  Feel around.
[07:45.400 --> 07:46.400]  Is it wet inside?
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.400]  Does it feel funky?
[07:47.400 --> 07:49.400]  If it does, leave that jar open for a long time.
[07:49.400 --> 07:50.400]  If it doesn't, close it back up.
[07:50.400 --> 07:51.400]  Check it again in four hours.
[07:51.400 --> 07:52.400]  Feel it.
[07:52.400 --> 07:55.400]  If they're too wet, dump them out and just let them sit.
[07:55.400 --> 07:59.400]  Just let them sit out on a table or something just for a few hours until they don't feel real squishy.
[07:59.400 --> 08:00.400]  Then put them back in the jar.
[08:00.400 --> 08:02.400]  Then you want them to dry slowly.
[08:02.400 --> 08:05.400]  You want them to dry fairly slowly.
[08:05.400 --> 08:06.400]  The slower, the better.
[08:06.400 --> 08:10.400]  Hang them up for four or five days.
[08:10.400 --> 08:11.400]  That's basically your dry process.
[08:11.400 --> 08:16.400]  Once the sticks start popping, now you're safe to put them into an airtight container.
[08:16.400 --> 08:17.400]  Cut them off the sticks.
[08:17.400 --> 08:19.400]  Get them into an airtight container.
[08:19.400 --> 08:20.400]  They haven't been trimmed yet.
[08:20.400 --> 08:22.400]  If you want to trim them before you put them into the container, you can.
[08:22.400 --> 08:24.400]  But they don't need to be trimmed yet.
[08:24.400 --> 08:26.400]  This is how I do it because I've got large batches.
[08:26.400 --> 08:28.400]  They'll go into a container.
[08:28.400 --> 08:30.400]  Then you have to burp that container frequently.
[08:30.400 --> 08:35.400]  The burping interval will extend over time.
[08:35.400 --> 08:38.400]  Your first day, you're going to want to burp them every two or four hours.
[08:38.400 --> 08:41.400]  You're going to want to be obsessive in there and get in there and make sure they're not getting funky.
[08:42.400 --> 08:46.400]  If you start getting a warm, hay, funk sort of a smell, you're fucked up.
[08:46.400 --> 08:48.400]  If it starts smelling like ammonia, you're fucked up.
[08:48.400 --> 08:50.400]  You waited too long to open it.
[08:50.400 --> 08:52.400]  Every two to four hours, open it up.
[08:52.400 --> 08:53.400]  Stir those buds around.
[08:53.400 --> 08:54.400]  Check them out.
[08:54.400 --> 08:55.400]  Make sure they're not getting funky.
[08:55.400 --> 08:57.400]  Make sure nothing's pressed together too much.
[08:57.400 --> 08:58.400]  Make sure nothing is too juicy.
[08:58.400 --> 09:00.400]  Make sure it's not sweating in there.
[09:00.400 --> 09:01.400]  Open it up.
[09:01.400 --> 09:04.400]  Leave it open for 15 to 45 minutes based on how much moisture is in there.
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.400]  Again, you're going to have to learn this.
[09:06.400 --> 09:08.400]  It's an art that you're going to have to adjust to in your environment.
[09:08.400 --> 09:11.400]  I don't know how much humidity is where is in your area.
[09:11.400 --> 09:13.400]  I don't know the vapor pressure deficit in your area.
[09:13.400 --> 09:15.400]  I don't know the temperature in your area.
[09:15.400 --> 09:18.400]  I don't know how much water content is in your starting product.
[09:18.400 --> 09:20.400]  All of this is going to have to be adjusted.
[09:20.400 --> 09:21.400]  This is a guideline.
[09:21.400 --> 09:22.400]  Get it in the jars.
[09:22.400 --> 09:24.400]  Burp those jars frequently.
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.400]  Now, when you have time, dump it out and trim what you can.
[09:28.400 --> 09:29.400]  Separate the little trim leaf.
[09:29.400 --> 09:31.400]  Keep that aside for concentrates.
[09:31.400 --> 09:32.400]  Put the buds in another jar.
[09:32.400 --> 09:33.400]  Keep them.
[09:33.400 --> 09:36.400]  You're not going to have to burp those dried and cured buds as frequently.
[09:36.400 --> 09:37.400]  You can seal them up.
[09:37.400 --> 09:40.400]  Put them on the shelf or put them in ounce jars.
[09:40.400 --> 09:41.400]  However you want to do it.
[09:41.400 --> 09:42.400]  Quarter pound bags.
[09:42.400 --> 09:44.400]  Fucking pound baggies.
[09:44.400 --> 09:45.400]  However you want to do it.
[09:45.400 --> 09:47.400]  Stack them up and just check them out every so often.
[09:47.400 --> 09:49.400]  Make sure they don't get too dry or too wet again.
[09:49.400 --> 09:51.400]  Juanzilla just asked,
[09:51.400 --> 09:55.400]  What are your thoughts on Boveda or the Boost 2-Way Humidipacks?
[09:55.400 --> 10:01.400]  I don't like them because they kind of put a weird wet taste in my product is what I think.
[10:01.400 --> 10:05.400]  They were using them at the dispensary before I was part of management.
[10:05.400 --> 10:06.400]  That was part of the process.
[10:06.400 --> 10:08.400]  They would dry and cure the buds at the grow.
[10:08.400 --> 10:13.400]  Then they would throw a few Boveda packs in the packages and seal it up and then drive it to the dispensary.
[10:13.400 --> 10:16.400]  They would take the product and put it into a jar.
[10:16.400 --> 10:19.400]  Then they would add a Boveda pack to each jar.
[10:19.400 --> 10:21.400]  Every time I would buy the flowers, I could tell something was funky.
[10:21.400 --> 10:24.400]  Then I noticed that it was the Boveda pack.
[10:24.400 --> 10:25.400]  We started taking those out.
[10:25.400 --> 10:27.400]  I think it tastes like cannabis again.
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.400]  I think it imparts a watery taste.
[10:29.400 --> 10:33.400]  It just puts a wet flavor into it.
[10:33.400 --> 10:34.400]  I'm not a fan of it.
[10:34.400 --> 10:37.400]  If your buds are too dry, maybe that would help you moisten them up again.
[10:37.400 --> 10:39.400]  In Colorado, it gets really dry here.
[10:39.400 --> 10:41.400]  I understand why people use those.
[10:41.400 --> 10:42.400]  We get the Colorado crunch.
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.400]  If your herb is dried and cured properly, you probably shouldn't need a Boveda pack.
[10:46.400 --> 10:49.400]  How do I feel about bud stored in a freezer?
[10:49.400 --> 10:51.400]  Has it been dried and cured properly?
[10:51.400 --> 10:56.400]  If it was dried and cured properly and then it's sealed in something to where I'm sure that there's no moisture going to get in there,
[10:56.400 --> 10:58.400]  I don't see a problem with storing it in the freezer.
[10:58.400 --> 11:00.400]  However, I don't find it necessary.
[11:00.400 --> 11:02.400]  Maybe the refrigerator.
[11:02.400 --> 11:03.400]  That would be better.
[11:03.400 --> 11:05.400]  If you want to freeze it, that's cool.
[11:05.400 --> 11:06.400]  Freezing is a good way to preserve shit.
[11:06.400 --> 11:09.400]  I just don't know what that's going to do to your cannabinoid content.
[11:09.400 --> 11:10.400]  It's going to change something.
[11:10.400 --> 11:14.400]  Yes, in a bag, then glass, then freezer.
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.400]  If that's what you want to do, that works.
[11:16.400 --> 11:18.400]  There's nothing wrong with it, but it may be doing something to your cannabinoids.
[11:18.400 --> 11:21.400]  It's going to convert the THC and the CBD to other things.
[11:21.400 --> 11:22.400]  I'm not sure what's going to happen.
[11:22.400 --> 11:26.400]  I know that heat converts things, so cold's got to be doing something to it.
[11:28.400 --> 11:32.400]  Terps are essentially VOCs, which break down with light, water, and air.
[11:32.400 --> 11:34.400]  So, wouldn't burping be counterproductive?
[11:34.400 --> 11:36.400]  If you dry it, then just lock it in a jar for a week or two.
[11:36.400 --> 11:38.400]  It preserves more terps than burping.
[11:38.400 --> 11:43.400]  Yeah, but also, if you trap it in that jar, you've got to burp it to get the moisture out.
[11:43.400 --> 11:48.400]  The only way to remove chlorophyll is to have moisture.
[11:48.400 --> 11:49.400]  Ah.
[11:49.400 --> 11:55.400]  The oxygen, the moisture, and the darkness create anaerobic acid within the environment.
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.400]  That starts breaking down the chlorophyll and xanophyll,
[11:58.400 --> 12:02.400]  and it makes it able to become a vapor, which, when you open the lid, that escapes.
[12:02.400 --> 12:05.400]  Without opening the lid, that wouldn't be possible.
[12:05.400 --> 12:09.400]  If you kept it closed for too long, it would get funky in there.
[12:09.400 --> 12:13.400]  So, yeah, we do want to preserve the terps, but we have to get the moisture out.
[12:13.400 --> 12:15.400]  But, yeah, keeping it in the jar would be better for terps,
[12:15.400 --> 12:18.400]  but you've got to get it dried and cured first before you want to do that.
[12:18.400 --> 12:20.400]  You have to get the chlorophyll and the xanophyll out.
[12:20.400 --> 12:24.400]  The only way to do that is to have a little bit of moisture so that you can have the reaction.
[12:24.400 --> 12:26.400]  The chlorophyll comes out during curing.
[12:26.400 --> 12:28.400]  Yeah, that's what you're trying to do.
[12:28.400 --> 12:29.400]  That's why it tastes better.
[12:29.400 --> 12:31.400]  So, it drops a water molecule.
[12:31.400 --> 12:34.400]  When that water comes out, it brings out the chlorophyll.
[12:34.400 --> 12:39.400]  The moisture and the oxygen create an acid in there that help break down that chlorophyll.
[12:39.400 --> 12:41.400]  When you open the jar, that pops out.
[12:41.400 --> 12:46.400]  Also, when it loses that water molecule, the THC drops a water molecule and becomes more psychoactive.
[12:46.400 --> 12:49.400]  That's what the drying and curing process are all about.
[12:49.400 --> 12:53.400]  Is homemade, open-end BHO decent if purged properly?
[12:53.400 --> 12:55.400]  Are you talking about open blast?
[12:55.400 --> 12:59.400]  Like, somebody just blasting it in their house or in their backyard?
[12:59.400 --> 13:01.400]  Hopefully, they're not blasting in the house, right?
[13:01.400 --> 13:02.400]  Yeah.
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.400]  Back in the day, all we had was homemade, open-blasted BHO.
[13:06.400 --> 13:07.400]  That's all we had.
[13:07.400 --> 13:08.400]  That's what we started with.
[13:08.400 --> 13:11.400]  That's what people used to win cups and shit with.
[13:11.400 --> 13:13.400]  So, yeah, if it's purged properly, it can be great.
[13:13.400 --> 13:16.400]  Some of the better stuff is still the small batch stuff, in my opinion.
[13:16.400 --> 13:19.400]  Do you have a good idea about your keeper pheno while hunting before smoking it?
[13:19.400 --> 13:20.400]  Yes.
[13:20.400 --> 13:23.400]  As the grower and the breeder, I can see it by week five or six.
[13:23.400 --> 13:24.400]  I already know.
[13:24.400 --> 13:27.400]  How long veg my plants before a flip, mate?
[13:28.400 --> 13:29.400]  That's a good question.
[13:29.400 --> 13:31.400]  How long do I veg my plants before I flip?
[13:31.400 --> 13:35.400]  That is all based on the size of your grow space and how many plants you've got
[13:35.400 --> 13:37.400]  and how long you've got to grow.
[13:37.400 --> 13:40.400]  If you've got a low ceiling, you've got to flip early.
[13:40.400 --> 13:44.400]  If you have a whole bunch of space, go forever.
[13:44.400 --> 13:46.400]  It depends on the size of pot you're going to use.
[13:46.400 --> 13:48.400]  It depends on the size of plant you want when you finish.
[13:48.400 --> 13:53.400]  I would say veg it until it is about a third of the size you want it done.
[13:53.400 --> 13:54.400]  A third to a half.
[13:54.400 --> 13:57.400]  It's going to double or triple in size based on genetics.
[13:57.400 --> 14:01.400]  If you start off, if you veg your plant until it's a foot tall,
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.400]  by the time it's done, it is going to be two to three feet tall.
[14:05.400 --> 14:06.400]  Keep that in mind.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.400]  It's going to double or triple in size depending on the strain,
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.400]  the genetics, where it's from, and how much light you've got.
[14:14.400 --> 14:16.400]  If you don't have enough light, it's going to stretch even more.
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.400]  For the first three weeks of flower, that plant is going to take off
[14:19.400 --> 14:21.400]  and skyrocket and just start stretching.
[14:21.400 --> 14:24.400]  You're going to have to learn how to keep it down if it gets too tall.
[14:24.400 --> 14:28.400]  Veg it until, if you've got six foot ceilings,
[14:28.400 --> 14:30.400]  I would say veg it until it's about two feet tall,
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.400]  and then you've got to flip it because it's going to end up six feet tall
[14:32.400 --> 14:33.400]  by the time it's done.
[14:33.400 --> 14:35.400]  Maybe flip it at 18 inches.
[14:35.400 --> 14:38.400]  Just do the math and make sure to save yourself some ceiling height
[14:38.400 --> 14:42.400]  from the light because you want to be at least 16 to 18 inches from the light
[14:42.400 --> 14:44.400]  if you're using a really hot light.
[14:44.400 --> 14:46.400]  You may be able to get closer if you've got some cooler lights,
[14:46.400 --> 14:48.400]  but you're going to have to save yourself some space.
[14:48.400 --> 14:51.400]  How long do I let my plants veg before I flip?
[14:51.400 --> 14:53.400]  Without knowing about your grow space, without knowing about your plants,
[14:53.400 --> 14:57.400]  your pot size, your environment or anything, my best guess is to say
[14:57.400 --> 15:01.400]  let them get half to two-thirds or half to a third of the size you want them
[15:01.400 --> 15:03.400]  when they're done because they're going to double or triple in size
[15:03.400 --> 15:05.400]  by the time they finish.
[15:05.400 --> 15:06.400]  Hope that helps.
[15:06.400 --> 15:11.400]  What are your favorite stem turps you look for in your male plants?
[15:11.400 --> 15:13.400]  Okay, I get it now.
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.400]  He's talking about when I rub the stem on my male plants,
[15:17.400 --> 15:20.400]  what is the aroma and flavor I'm looking for?
[15:20.400 --> 15:23.400]  It kind of depends on what I'm going after.
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.400]  It sounds disgusting, but the puke turp, there are male plants that smell like puke.
[15:27.400 --> 15:31.400]  I've had great success with male plants that smell like puke every time.
[15:31.400 --> 15:34.400]  If it smells like vomit on the stem rub, it's always a good thing.
[15:34.400 --> 15:37.400]  If it smells like vomit and it makes trichomes and turns purple,
[15:37.400 --> 15:40.400]  that's always a good male plant in my opinion.
[15:40.400 --> 15:43.400]  If I'm looking to breed something more on the sweet side,
[15:43.400 --> 15:45.400]  I start looking for those sweet turps.
[15:45.400 --> 15:47.400]  If I'm looking for a fruit or a candy flavor,
[15:47.400 --> 15:50.400]  I kind of start looking for that on the stem rub.
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.400]  Then when it goes into flower, I'll go bust open some of the male flowers
[15:54.400 --> 15:56.400]  and smell them and rub my fingers on them.
[15:56.400 --> 15:59.400]  That male plant is going to put off some good aroma.
[15:59.400 --> 16:01.400]  You don't have to go with just stem rub.
[16:01.400 --> 16:03.400]  You can go up on the flowers also.
[16:03.400 --> 16:04.400]  Let your male plants go.
[16:04.400 --> 16:07.400]  Just because they flower out and give you pollen around 25 days
[16:07.400 --> 16:10.400]  and you can coat the whole fucking room, doesn't mean you have to cut it down then.
[16:10.400 --> 16:12.400]  Let it go six weeks. See what it does.
[16:12.400 --> 16:13.400]  Watch the trichomes build up.
[16:13.400 --> 16:15.400]  Watch that male plant. See what it's like.
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.400]  Then, here's something else you can do that I don't talk about a lot.
[16:20.400 --> 16:21.400]  This is kind of a trade secret.
[16:21.400 --> 16:24.400]  This is something that I don't know how many breeders do this,
[16:24.400 --> 16:27.400]  but this is something I thought of a while back.
[16:27.400 --> 16:29.400]  Why not reverse a male plant?
[16:29.400 --> 16:32.400]  If you've got a male plant and you want to know what kind of flavors
[16:32.400 --> 16:35.400]  and aromas it's going to put off, reverse it.
[16:35.400 --> 16:37.400]  Just like we reverse our female plants to make males,
[16:37.400 --> 16:40.400]  you can reverse a male to make a female.
[16:41.400 --> 16:44.400]  You can reverse your male plants to make them females.
[16:44.400 --> 16:47.400]  Then you can see what they do as a girl.
[16:47.400 --> 16:51.400]  You can see what your progeny from that male has potential of doing.
[16:51.400 --> 16:54.400]  You can see what you're going to do.
[16:54.400 --> 16:55.400]  Does that make any sense?
[16:55.400 --> 16:57.400]  I think so. I think I worded that correctly.
[16:57.400 --> 16:59.400]  You can make your male plant turn into a girl,
[16:59.400 --> 17:02.400]  and then you'll have an idea of what it would look like as a girl,
[17:02.400 --> 17:05.400]  and you'll have an idea of what you're going to make when you breed with that male plant.
[17:05.400 --> 17:08.400]  That's a good way to find out what you've got.
[17:09.400 --> 17:11.400]  All right.
[17:11.400 --> 17:12.400]  The next question.
[17:12.400 --> 17:14.400]  How do you feel about the burners for spider mites?
[17:14.400 --> 17:17.400]  I'm afraid of flavoring my buds.
[17:17.400 --> 17:18.400]  Burners for spider mites?
[17:18.400 --> 17:19.400]  What are you burning?
[17:19.400 --> 17:21.400]  Are you talking about sulfur burners for spider mites?
[17:21.400 --> 17:24.400]  I don't know that a sulfur burner for spider mites is what you would do,
[17:24.400 --> 17:25.400]  and I don't know that that's what you're talking about,
[17:25.400 --> 17:27.400]  but tell me more and I'll try to help you out.
[17:27.400 --> 17:28.400]  Burners for spider mites.
[17:28.400 --> 17:29.400]  I don't know what you mean.
[17:29.400 --> 17:30.400]  What up, 702?
[17:30.400 --> 17:31.400]  Thanks for jumping in.
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.400]  What do you think about semi-industrial home rosin presses?
[17:35.400 --> 17:36.400]  I am not into rosin.
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.400]  I think rosin tastes like a burnt popcorn or a popsicle stick.
[17:40.400 --> 17:42.400]  It's not my thing.
[17:42.400 --> 17:43.400]  I'm not happy with rosin.
[17:43.400 --> 17:45.400]  No thank you.
[17:45.400 --> 17:48.400]  So I have no good info for you on that.
[17:48.400 --> 17:50.400]  Sorry.
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.400]  My friend has a burner, and he said he would give me,
[17:52.400 --> 17:53.400]  but I can just order predatory.
[17:53.400 --> 17:55.400]  Dude, I would order the predatory mites.
[17:55.400 --> 17:58.400]  If you are in flower and you have got bugs,
[17:58.400 --> 18:00.400]  the predatory mites are probably the way to go.
[18:00.400 --> 18:03.400]  Get the Swarskies, the Californias.
[18:03.400 --> 18:05.400]  Maybe get yourself some lace wings.
[18:05.400 --> 18:08.400]  Don't even fuck around with the praying mantis at this point.
[18:08.400 --> 18:12.400]  Just get in there with smaller predator mites and let them do the work.
[18:13.400 --> 18:15.400]  Is there anything you avoid in a male?
[18:18.400 --> 18:20.400]  Way too stretchiness.
[18:20.400 --> 18:22.400]  Okay, here's something to think about.
[18:22.400 --> 18:25.400]  If I've got a 10-pack of seeds and five of them are a boy,
[18:25.400 --> 18:26.400]  five of them are girls,
[18:26.400 --> 18:29.400]  I would never use the first two males that flower out.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.400]  And that may sound weird,
[18:30.400 --> 18:32.400]  but those two,
[18:32.400 --> 18:35.400]  the first two males to show me that their boys are going to be too robust,
[18:35.400 --> 18:37.400]  they're going to make hemp,
[18:37.400 --> 18:39.400]  they're going to be too dominant in my cross.
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.400]  All of my crosses will come out just like them.
[18:43.400 --> 18:46.400]  So I try to find a male that if I had five males,
[18:46.400 --> 18:48.400]  probably that third or fourth one that flips,
[18:48.400 --> 18:51.400]  that starts to show in me that he has a strong stud,
[18:51.400 --> 18:54.400]  that's probably more likely to be used than the first two,
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.400]  the third or fourth.
[18:56.400 --> 18:58.400]  But if it auto-flowers, I don't want it.
[18:58.400 --> 19:00.400]  If it can't handle nutrients, I don't want it.
[19:00.400 --> 19:02.400]  If it doesn't give me any trichomes or any colors, I don't want it.
[19:02.400 --> 19:04.400]  If it doesn't have a good structure, I don't want it.
[19:06.400 --> 19:10.400]  Man, it's more of what I do want is easier to list than what I avoid.
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.400]  Also, what about stripping the males of a select few pollen branches
[19:14.400 --> 19:16.400]  or just let it go naturally?
[19:16.400 --> 19:17.400]  I bottom up a little bit.
[19:17.400 --> 19:20.400]  I don't lollipop as heavily as I do my female plants,
[19:20.400 --> 19:22.400]  but I do lollipop a little bit.
[19:22.400 --> 19:24.400]  And then when they start going,
[19:24.400 --> 19:28.400]  I like to set them up on another plant so that he gets up a little bit higher,
[19:28.400 --> 19:30.400]  so that he's up above the canopy a little bit,
[19:30.400 --> 19:32.400]  so that when he does start dumping, his stuff falls.
[19:34.400 --> 19:36.400]  But I don't strip them too heavily.
[19:36.400 --> 19:39.400]  I like a lot of branches because I need a lot of pollen.
[19:39.400 --> 19:41.400]  The way I fuck around, I use a lot of pollen.
[19:42.400 --> 19:44.400]  What flavors do you prefer, bro?
[19:44.400 --> 19:47.400]  Fruit-tasting strains or fuel-and-chemi-type strains?
[19:47.400 --> 19:50.400]  Yes. It just depends on what I'm looking for.
[19:50.400 --> 19:52.400]  And flowers, if I'm smoking...
[19:52.400 --> 19:54.400]  So you're from the UK, if I recall correctly.
[19:54.400 --> 19:57.400]  We call the buds, the pot, we call that flowers here.
[19:57.400 --> 20:00.400]  The concentrates, the hash, we call that concentrates.
[20:00.400 --> 20:05.400]  So the flowers, I prefer more of the gassy, chemi, fuel kind of flavor,
[20:05.400 --> 20:07.400]  the earthy stuff out of my flower.
[20:07.400 --> 20:11.400]  But when I'm smoking concentrates, I like the candy, fruit,
[20:12.400 --> 20:15.400]  lemon, skittle-y kind of watermelon-y sort of stuff.
[20:15.400 --> 20:17.400]  That's what I would prefer.
[20:17.400 --> 20:21.400]  So flowery, earthy concentrates, or flowery, earthy flowers,
[20:21.400 --> 20:26.400]  earthy, cushy flowers, fuel-y flowers, and candy concentrates is kind of my thing.
[20:26.400 --> 20:29.400]  Don't get me wrong, I'll take a fat dab of some Stardog or whatever you got
[20:29.400 --> 20:32.400]  if it tastes earthy and fuel-y, but I would just prefer the candy turps.
[20:33.400 --> 20:37.400]  This do-si-do that I was smoking, it had like a nice vanilla creamsicle sort of a thing to it
[20:37.400 --> 20:39.400]  with some chocolate behind it and some earth in it.
[20:40.400 --> 20:42.400]  That was really nice. The Skywalkers got straight up this cush,
[20:42.400 --> 20:47.400]  but then I've got this lemon taffy that it's candy and lemons, which I really love.
[20:47.400 --> 20:50.400]  And then I've got... what else do I have?
[20:50.400 --> 20:54.400]  I've got the cantaloupe, which is real fruity and it tastes like a cantaloupe, honestly.
