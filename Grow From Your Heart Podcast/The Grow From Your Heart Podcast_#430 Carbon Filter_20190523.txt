[00:00.000 --> 00:02.140]  Hey, welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:02.140 --> 00:06.260]  It is time for Episode 430 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.260 --> 00:10.120]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:10.120 --> 00:14.760]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:14.760 --> 00:20.440]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:20.440 --> 00:23.880]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.880 --> 00:28.880]  I just took a delicious dab of something called Garlic Banger Live Batter from our friends
[00:28.880 --> 00:30.600]  at Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.600 --> 00:34.120]  The package says this is a blend of Han Solo Burger and Headbanger.
[00:34.120 --> 00:37.480]  The flavor is described as diesel, garlic, and dark roast.
[00:37.480 --> 00:39.360]  I would absolutely agree with all of that.
[00:39.360 --> 00:41.080]  The diesel hits you right away.
[00:41.080 --> 00:43.160]  The aroma is straight diesel.
[00:43.160 --> 00:44.320]  The flavor is garlicky.
[00:44.320 --> 00:46.040]  It is really savory.
[00:46.040 --> 00:49.560]  It is really robust, and that dark roast kind of lingers on the tongue.
[00:49.560 --> 00:53.680]  It almost tastes like I just ate garlic mashed potatoes and washed it down with a sip of
[00:53.680 --> 00:54.720]  sweetened coffee.
[00:54.720 --> 00:56.040]  I really enjoy the aroma.
[00:56.040 --> 00:57.680]  I really enjoy the flavor.
[00:57.680 --> 00:59.800]  The buzz went straight to my body.
[00:59.800 --> 01:03.360]  I felt myself just chill the fuck out right when I hit this.
[01:03.360 --> 01:04.720]  Great work on this concentrate.
[01:04.720 --> 01:10.280]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the Garlic Banger Live Batter.
[01:10.280 --> 01:11.520]  All right, podcast world.
[01:11.520 --> 01:15.600]  In this episode, I am going to focus on an email about where to place a carbon filter
[01:15.600 --> 01:19.480]  in a grow tent, but before we get there, I would like to give a shout out to a few of
[01:19.480 --> 01:22.140]  our friends from Patreon.
[01:22.140 --> 01:24.520]  Let's start off with a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:57.480 --> 02:01.960]  slash growfromyourheart and all of the information that you need should be right there on the
[02:01.960 --> 02:02.960]  screen.
[02:02.960 --> 02:07.160]  All right, I said that I had an email talking about where to place a carbon filter in a
[02:07.160 --> 02:08.160]  grow tent.
[02:08.160 --> 02:10.120]  Let's jump right into that.
[02:10.120 --> 02:11.680]  This email came in in two parts.
[02:11.680 --> 02:16.600]  The first part of the email asked about where to place the carbon filter and blower in a
[02:16.600 --> 02:17.600]  grow tent.
[02:17.600 --> 02:20.920]  The second part of the question asked, is it better to have negative pressure where
[02:20.920 --> 02:25.400]  the tent is sucked in or positive pressure where the tent is ballooning out?
[02:25.400 --> 02:27.000]  That is a very good question.
[02:27.000 --> 02:28.680]  A lot of people are growing in grow tents.
[02:28.680 --> 02:31.080]  I think a five by five grow tent is a great setup.
[02:31.080 --> 02:34.440]  It's a very efficient way for somebody to produce their own medicine without doing a
[02:34.440 --> 02:36.640]  lot of modifications to a home.
[02:36.640 --> 02:41.460]  So let's talk a little bit about effectively and efficiently setting up a grow tent.
[02:41.460 --> 02:43.700]  Most of the tents come with passive vents at the bottom.
[02:43.700 --> 02:47.240]  You can lift up a little flap and Velcro it to the inside of the tent and it will stay
[02:47.240 --> 02:50.880]  open so that you can get passive air coming into the tent through the bottom.
[02:50.880 --> 02:52.840]  I really like that.
[02:52.840 --> 02:57.060]  Most of them also have a hole toward the top on the right and left side of the tent that
[02:57.060 --> 02:58.680]  allow you to run ducting.
[02:58.680 --> 03:00.560]  We use that in some situations.
[03:00.560 --> 03:04.760]  Today we are probably going to focus mostly on the hole that most of those tents have
[03:04.760 --> 03:05.880]  at the very top.
[03:05.880 --> 03:09.720]  Most of the time there's a six or eight inch hole in the top right back corner.
[03:09.720 --> 03:13.440]  I like to use that for exhausting heat, for exhausting humidity.
[03:13.440 --> 03:17.800]  That is where we are most likely going to run our ducting through in this situation.
[03:17.800 --> 03:23.480]  So the first part of this question is where do I place my carbon filter in my new tent?
[03:23.480 --> 03:27.560]  In an ideal world, you would hang that carbon filter at the very top of the inside of the
[03:27.560 --> 03:30.920]  tent as close to the center as you could possibly get it.
[03:30.920 --> 03:35.520]  Now the problem with that is most of those grow tents are not built sturdily enough to
[03:35.520 --> 03:39.920]  support the weight of a carbon filter, a blower and some duct work once you've already got
[03:39.920 --> 03:41.800]  a light hanging in there.
[03:41.800 --> 03:46.400]  If you have got a sturdy enough tent and you feel like it can hold the carbon filter
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.640]  and the blower and the light on that frame that you've already got built in there, you
[03:50.640 --> 03:54.280]  can hang the carbon filter inside of the tent.
[03:54.280 --> 03:58.880]  In a well-designed grow room, I like to hang my carbon filter and my blower from the ceiling.
[03:58.880 --> 04:00.400]  I like to have it up high.
[04:00.400 --> 04:02.960]  I like to get it up off the floor for a couple of reasons.
[04:02.960 --> 04:05.440]  First of all, that floor space is very valuable.
[04:05.440 --> 04:07.920]  I want to use all of my floor space for plants.
[04:07.920 --> 04:11.120]  I don't want to take up real estate on the ground with extra equipment.
[04:11.120 --> 04:13.160]  So I would prefer to hang it if possible.
[04:13.160 --> 04:19.200]  Also, the air that I want to remove from the grow room is usually that stale, hot, stagnant
[04:19.200 --> 04:20.200]  air up at the top.
[04:20.200 --> 04:22.640]  The humidity and the heat are going to rise.
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.460]  So let's put the extraction filter and the extraction fan up there and pull that crappy
[04:26.460 --> 04:29.240]  air out of the room and shoot it right out of the tent.
[04:29.240 --> 04:34.200]  Now I said in an ideal world, we would hang that filter from the ceiling, from those bars.
[04:34.200 --> 04:35.480]  It would be up high.
[04:35.480 --> 04:39.440]  I understand that carbon filters and blowers are quite heavy.
[04:39.440 --> 04:45.360]  I don't trust most of those tents to support a carbon filter, a blower, the duct work,
[04:45.360 --> 04:46.480]  and my light.
[04:46.480 --> 04:52.360]  So this is how I set up a grow tent in most situations and in most environments.
[04:52.360 --> 04:56.360]  Now one thing we should talk about before we start setting up our tent is, are we running
[04:56.360 --> 04:58.480]  open or ducted hoods?
[04:58.480 --> 05:03.120]  Which means, does your light setup have an open bulb to where that heat from the bulb
[05:03.120 --> 05:06.920]  is just filling your grow room and your grow space and your grow tent?
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.840]  Or did you buy a vented hood, which means there are ducts coming off of each end of
[05:11.840 --> 05:17.240]  the hood and there is glass between the bulb and your canopy, trapping the heat inside
[05:17.240 --> 05:21.680]  of that fixture and allowing you to move the heat away from the bulb and away from the
[05:21.680 --> 05:24.440]  grow room by using ducting and a blower.
[05:24.440 --> 05:29.280]  Depending on which type of hood you purchased or which type of hood you were working with,
[05:29.280 --> 05:31.020]  that will change our setup.
[05:31.020 --> 05:34.940]  It won't be too drastic, but keep in mind it will make a difference.
[05:34.960 --> 05:40.140]  So first, let's talk about running a ducted, vented hood.
[05:40.140 --> 05:44.220]  Since I don't trust my grow tent to support the weight of that carbon filter, I generally
[05:44.220 --> 05:49.780]  place my filter in the back left or back right corner of the grow tent on a cinder block.
[05:49.780 --> 05:53.500]  I get a cinder block from the local hardware store, then I put that cinder block in the
[05:53.500 --> 05:56.260]  back left or back right corner of my grow tent.
[05:56.260 --> 05:59.380]  Then I place the carbon filter right on top of that cinder block.
[05:59.380 --> 06:02.580]  So I've got a cinder block with a carbon filter sitting on it now.
[06:02.700 --> 06:05.340]  Here's where you've got a couple of choices.
[06:05.340 --> 06:10.580]  In my situation, I will take a cinder block, then the carbon filter, then I set the blower
[06:10.580 --> 06:11.860]  directly on top of it.
[06:11.860 --> 06:14.300]  Now all of my heavy equipment is right there on the ground.
[06:14.300 --> 06:15.520]  It's easily accessible.
[06:15.520 --> 06:16.520]  I trust it.
[06:16.520 --> 06:17.520]  I know it's safe.
[06:17.520 --> 06:18.520]  I know it's not going to fall.
[06:18.520 --> 06:19.520]  I can see the cord.
[06:19.520 --> 06:20.620]  I know where it plugs in.
[06:20.620 --> 06:21.740]  Everything is safe for me.
[06:21.740 --> 06:22.940]  I really like it that way.
[06:22.940 --> 06:27.060]  So my carbon filter, I've got a cinder block, carbon filter, blower.
[06:27.060 --> 06:28.180]  That's on the floor.
[06:28.180 --> 06:29.440]  Then the ducting runs.
[06:29.440 --> 06:30.960]  This is where we have to make adjustments.
[06:30.960 --> 06:36.000]  My ducting runs to the left side of my light hood because I have got a ducted light hood.
[06:36.000 --> 06:40.460]  So I've got cinder block, carbon filter, blower, ducting.
[06:40.460 --> 06:42.720]  That ducting runs to a light.
[06:42.720 --> 06:45.100]  It attaches to the left side of the light.
[06:45.100 --> 06:48.600]  Then more ducting attaches to the right side of the light.
[06:48.600 --> 06:53.440]  That ducting that stems off of the right side of my ducted hood goes right up to that hole
[06:53.440 --> 06:57.120]  on the top right side of the tent and goes right out of that hole.
[06:57.120 --> 07:01.720]  I continue that ducting really long to where I can aim that air and get that air to where
[07:01.720 --> 07:02.880]  I need it.
[07:02.880 --> 07:07.240]  So basically at this point, I've got a cinder block in the back corner with a carbon filter,
[07:07.240 --> 07:10.960]  with a blower, with some ducting going to my light, then out of the other side of the
[07:10.960 --> 07:12.720]  light right out of the tent.
[07:12.720 --> 07:16.880]  Then you can run long ducting to where you can have that air wherever you want it.
[07:16.880 --> 07:21.480]  I actually hang that ducting all the way across the ceiling in the grow room in which that
[07:21.480 --> 07:22.800]  tent is sitting.
[07:22.800 --> 07:26.880]  I run that ducting all the way to the door so I can shoot that hot air out of that grow
[07:26.920 --> 07:29.880]  room, out of that room in which the tent is in.
[07:29.880 --> 07:32.680]  That way I'm not just reheating that room constantly.
[07:32.680 --> 07:36.080]  In just a minute, we are going to talk about environmentally controlling your tent in
[07:36.080 --> 07:37.080]  another room.
[07:37.080 --> 07:39.080]  We'll talk about that real briefly here in just a moment.
[07:39.080 --> 07:47.080]  Your first option is to go cinder block, carbon filter, blower, ducting, light, ducting.
[07:47.080 --> 07:49.760]  Then you run that ducting out of the top of the tent.
[07:49.760 --> 07:53.600]  Then you run that ducting as far as you need to to get that air away from the grow space
[07:53.600 --> 07:54.600]  as far as you can.
[07:55.000 --> 07:59.120]  If you've got enough cooling, just dump it right into the room and refresh and replenish
[07:59.120 --> 08:00.120]  the cool air in that room.
[08:00.120 --> 08:02.960]  We're going to talk about that, like I said, in just a moment.
[08:02.960 --> 08:09.200]  If you do not have a sealed light hood, you're not able to run that ducting over the light.
[08:09.200 --> 08:13.160]  You're just going to have to run, it'll basically be your carbon filter sitting on a cinder
[08:13.160 --> 08:14.160]  block.
[08:14.160 --> 08:17.240]  Then you've got your blower and then your ducting will just run right out of the top
[08:17.240 --> 08:21.000]  of that tent so that you can get that heat and that stale air right out of there.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.440]  The idea here is we want to remove the humidity and that stale old stagnant air that all the
[08:26.440 --> 08:27.720]  CO2 has been used up.
[08:27.720 --> 08:31.480]  We want to replace that air with fresh air, with fresh CO2.
[08:31.480 --> 08:33.000]  For us, fresh air is oxygen.
[08:33.000 --> 08:35.200]  For those plants, fresh air is CO2.
[08:35.200 --> 08:36.860]  We got to get fresh CO2 in there.
[08:36.860 --> 08:39.120]  We need to get that old stagnant humid air out.
[08:39.120 --> 08:41.840]  We want to shoot the heat and old air out of the top.
[08:41.840 --> 08:45.880]  What that does is that makes those passive vents, they just bring air in right at the
[08:45.880 --> 08:49.360]  bottom and those plants are just getting fresh air so that we're not getting old stagnant
[08:49.360 --> 08:51.080]  air in the tent all day long.
[08:51.080 --> 08:53.160]  The plants will really appreciate that.
[08:53.160 --> 08:55.960]  I would always put the carbon filter inside of the tent.
[08:55.960 --> 08:56.960]  That's where the plants are.
[08:56.960 --> 08:58.280]  We want to treat that air.
[08:58.280 --> 09:00.480]  You want the air coming out of there to not stink.
[09:00.480 --> 09:04.900]  You've got the carbon filter, then you've got your blower, the appropriate size blower.
[09:04.900 --> 09:09.040]  Make sure you get the appropriate size carbon filter and the appropriate size blower.
[09:09.040 --> 09:11.800]  They're not going to work if you don't have the right sizes.
[09:11.800 --> 09:13.040]  Make sure they match up.
[09:13.040 --> 09:15.880]  Make sure you're getting enough cleaning for the size space you're using.
[09:15.880 --> 09:19.620]  Make sure you're moving enough air for the size space you're using.
[09:19.620 --> 09:24.540]  In most of my experiences, I have noticed that a six inch blower and a carbon filter
[09:24.540 --> 09:29.840]  that is somewhere between 12 and 24 inches tall work perfectly for a five by five grow
[09:29.840 --> 09:32.680]  tent and a home grow type of environment.
[09:32.680 --> 09:34.760]  Now here is something to think about.
[09:34.760 --> 09:39.120]  Our blowers are more efficient at sucking air than pushing air.
[09:39.120 --> 09:44.780]  If you have your blower at the last end of your setup, it is going to be more efficient
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.620]  than if you have your blower sitting on top of the carbon filter.
[09:47.620 --> 09:51.420]  Yes, I did recommend that we set our blower on top of the carbon filter.
[09:51.420 --> 09:54.220]  I'll give you a couple of reasons why I recommend that.
[09:54.220 --> 09:55.500]  First, it's heavy.
[09:55.500 --> 09:56.980]  Where else are we going to put it?
[09:56.980 --> 10:02.100]  Oftentimes, I will set that blower directly on the top of my five by five tent with the
[10:02.100 --> 10:05.740]  bottom of it just facing right inside that hole and then I'll run the ducting right off
[10:05.740 --> 10:06.740]  of there.
[10:06.740 --> 10:07.740]  That is effective.
[10:07.740 --> 10:08.740]  That is efficient.
[10:08.740 --> 10:13.660]  If you trust your grow tent will hold that big blower, that six inch hydroform blower,
[10:13.660 --> 10:14.660]  go for it.
[10:14.660 --> 10:15.660]  Trust it.
[10:15.660 --> 10:19.620]  Here is one of the things to look out for if you do that.
[10:19.620 --> 10:24.940]  If you are running a ducted hood and you do your carbon filter, your ducting, and then
[10:24.940 --> 10:31.420]  your light, then more ducting, then you have your blower at the end, you do allow the opportunity
[10:31.420 --> 10:35.100]  for aroma to be sucked up through the light.
[10:35.100 --> 10:41.220]  If your vented light hood is not 100% sealed and you have suction at the top of the tent,
[10:41.220 --> 10:45.060]  you are allowing air to be sucked through that light and then out of the tent and that
[10:45.060 --> 10:48.100]  air is not passing through your carbon filter.
[10:48.100 --> 10:49.600]  That air will not be treated.
[10:49.600 --> 10:54.940]  You do give the option for odor and aroma to escape the grow tent at that time.
[10:54.940 --> 11:00.100]  If you are going to run a ducted vented light, I recommend that carbon filter and the blower
[11:00.100 --> 11:02.580]  stay together down at the start of the chain.
[11:02.580 --> 11:07.100]  If you are running a light that is not vented and not ducted and you don't have any interruptions
[11:07.260 --> 11:12.420]  in your chain of airflow, you are able to put that blower at the top outside of the
[11:12.420 --> 11:16.060]  grow tent and it will suck that air right through your carbon filter, right up through
[11:16.060 --> 11:19.700]  the ducting, right out of the top of the tent and it will remove your heat and humidity
[11:19.700 --> 11:20.980]  for you.
[11:20.980 --> 11:24.780]  Now that you understand the chain of command or the order in which this equipment should
[11:24.780 --> 11:29.860]  go, you can make the decision on, do I want to put my carbon filter up high in this grow
[11:29.860 --> 11:30.860]  tent?
[11:30.860 --> 11:34.220]  If you are confident that it will stay up there, if you're confident that it won't fall,
[11:34.220 --> 11:36.940]  hang it up top because that is the ideal place.
[11:36.940 --> 11:38.400]  That is where the heat is going to go.
[11:38.400 --> 11:39.820]  That's where the humidity is going to go.
[11:39.820 --> 11:42.740]  Your light will be creating heat the entire time it is on.
[11:42.740 --> 11:45.780]  So if you've got that carbon filter right above the light, you can just suck that light
[11:45.780 --> 11:47.060]  heat right out of there.
[11:47.060 --> 11:50.740]  It will really help you control the grow room and control the environment if you can get
[11:50.740 --> 11:51.980]  that up high.
[11:51.980 --> 11:56.340]  Now I recommend leaving that blower and that carbon filter on constantly to keep constant
[11:56.340 --> 11:59.500]  airflow and constant air exchange in that grow tent.
[11:59.500 --> 12:03.340]  Now I did say that it is ideal to have that thing up top so that we can remove the heat
[12:03.340 --> 12:04.940]  and humidity.
[12:04.940 --> 12:09.260]  But think about this, we're kind of using more blower than we need.
[12:09.260 --> 12:10.860]  I recommended a six inch blower.
[12:10.860 --> 12:15.020]  That is honestly more fan, more extraction than what we need in this environment.
[12:15.020 --> 12:18.380]  But if we put that six inch in there and we run it all the time and you put it in the
[12:18.380 --> 12:23.380]  bottom corner, I am certain that we are going to get enough air exchange in your grow tent
[12:23.380 --> 12:26.060]  that you won't get old stagnant air.
[12:26.060 --> 12:29.500]  Most of the fresh air will come in through the bottom and be replenished, but we're sucking
[12:29.500 --> 12:34.500]  so much air out of that five by five tent that you will exchange the air very quickly,
[12:34.500 --> 12:38.060]  which brings us to the second part of this question, which says, is it better to have
[12:38.060 --> 12:42.180]  negative pressure where the tent is sucked in or positive pressure where the tent is
[12:42.180 --> 12:43.440]  ballooning out?
[12:43.440 --> 12:44.980]  Let's think about what we're doing here.
[12:44.980 --> 12:48.280]  We are putting a blower and a carbon filter inside of the tent.
[12:48.280 --> 12:50.540]  We're going to zip it up and we're going to turn it on.
[12:50.540 --> 12:54.860]  That thing is going to suck a lot of air outside of that tent very rapidly.
[12:54.860 --> 13:01.080]  I think a six inch vortex fan moves something like 400 or 500 cubic feet per minute.
[13:01.080 --> 13:02.940]  So you're going to plug in that blower.
[13:02.940 --> 13:03.940]  It'll start spinning.
[13:03.940 --> 13:04.940]  You'll hear it warm up.
[13:04.940 --> 13:09.100]  That's my impression of a blower.
[13:09.100 --> 13:13.160]  Once it gets to the full speed, you'll watch that grow tent just suck in.
[13:13.160 --> 13:17.900]  It'll cave in and it'll start looking like it's a big girl trying to suck it in for a
[13:17.900 --> 13:18.960]  photo.
[13:18.960 --> 13:20.960]  But that is exactly what you want.
[13:20.960 --> 13:24.140]  Now you know that all of the air coming out of that tent is being sucked through that
[13:24.140 --> 13:27.120]  blower and it is all passing through that carbon filter.
[13:27.120 --> 13:31.860]  So all of the air coming out of that ducting should be odor free if you set up your chain
[13:31.860 --> 13:33.580]  of command correctly.
[13:33.580 --> 13:36.740]  So let me touch on one detail just because I'm not sure if I made this clear.
[13:36.740 --> 13:40.560]  You've got your cinder block, you've got your carbon filter, and then you've got your blower.
[13:40.560 --> 13:46.020]  That air needs to be passing through the carbon filter and then out of the blower.
[13:46.020 --> 13:48.640]  So you want to be sucking, not blowing through the carbon filter.
[13:48.640 --> 13:53.200]  You want to be sucking to where the air is blown away from the filter, not through the
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.680]  outside of the filter.
[13:54.680 --> 13:57.520]  The air wants to come in through the filter, then out of the blower.
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.300]  I just want to make sure we've got the airflow going the correct direction.
[14:01.300 --> 14:03.360]  So let's talk about if we did it the opposite way.
[14:03.360 --> 14:07.780]  He asked if the tent should be sucking in or blowing out.
[14:07.780 --> 14:11.560]  If the tent were blowing out, that means that we were pumping a bunch of air into the tent
[14:11.560 --> 14:16.040]  and all of that odor, all of that aroma would just freely escape through all of the vents,
[14:16.040 --> 14:17.080]  all of the holes.
[14:17.080 --> 14:20.340]  It would blow that aroma all through your house, all through your whole neighborhood,
[14:20.340 --> 14:22.360]  and that carbon filter would be completely useless.
[14:22.360 --> 14:25.840]  It would be doing the exact opposite of what you needed it to do.
[14:25.840 --> 14:27.360]  So your tent should be sucking in.
[14:27.360 --> 14:29.780]  You should have the carbon filter inside the tent.
[14:29.780 --> 14:34.280]  You should have it sucking the air through the filter, through the blower, over the light,
[14:34.280 --> 14:35.440]  then right out of that tent.
[14:35.440 --> 14:39.780]  Then I like to run that ducting as far as I can from the tent if necessary.
[14:39.780 --> 14:42.560]  Like I said, I've got the tent in the corner of one grow room.
[14:42.560 --> 14:44.780]  Then I run that ducting across the ceiling.
[14:44.780 --> 14:48.560]  Then that ducting just goes right by the door and it shoots the hot air out of the door.
[14:48.560 --> 14:54.000]  Let's talk about controlling the environment in the room in which that grow tent is in.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.640]  I have seen people waste precious real estate in a grow tent by placing an air conditioner
[14:58.660 --> 14:59.740]  in the grow tent.
[14:59.740 --> 15:04.100]  I've seen people put a humidifier or a dehumidifier inside of a grow tent.
[15:04.100 --> 15:06.740]  I find that to be a huge waste of space.
[15:06.740 --> 15:08.580]  We've got a five by five grow tent.
[15:08.580 --> 15:11.220]  You put either a 600 or a thousand watt light in there.
[15:11.220 --> 15:13.500]  Maybe you've got yourself a nice Spectrum King light in there.
[15:13.500 --> 15:15.800]  Anyway, we've got a really highly efficient light.
[15:15.800 --> 15:18.180]  You bought just the right light for this five by five space.
[15:18.180 --> 15:19.600]  You're going to try to cram it with plants.
[15:19.600 --> 15:24.100]  And then let's waste a bunch of space by putting an air conditioner in one corner and a dehumidifier
[15:24.100 --> 15:25.380]  in another corner.
[15:25.380 --> 15:28.620]  Rostejef just told us we need to put a carbon filter in the other corner.
[15:28.620 --> 15:32.440]  We're going to run out of floor space very quickly in the grow tent.
[15:32.440 --> 15:38.080]  So if you've got the option, if you've got the opportunity, I suggest climate controlling
[15:38.080 --> 15:41.560]  the room in which that grow tent is in.
[15:41.560 --> 15:45.760]  I have got a grow tent in a spare bedroom slash office type of space that I don't use
[15:45.760 --> 15:46.760]  very often.
[15:46.760 --> 15:49.320]  There's a grow tent in the back corner of that room.
[15:49.320 --> 15:54.120]  I don't have an air conditioner or a humidifier or a dehumidifier inside that tent, but I
[15:54.120 --> 16:00.780]  do use the central air from my house to cool that room where that tent is.
[16:00.780 --> 16:05.020]  And that air is then sucked into the tent through those passive vents, which we talked
[16:05.020 --> 16:06.220]  about earlier.
[16:06.220 --> 16:10.180]  So I am not always struggling to cool the temperatures in my grow tent.
[16:10.180 --> 16:15.340]  I am relying on my central air or my heater or whatever season it is in my house.
[16:15.340 --> 16:19.980]  I am relying on my home cooling and heating system to keep that room comfortable for me.
[16:19.980 --> 16:23.540]  If it's comfortable for me, I assume it is probably comfortable for those plants.
[16:23.960 --> 16:27.560]  I've got a PL monitor in there so I can always tell what's going on in that grow tent.
[16:27.560 --> 16:32.840]  But as long as the room is comfortable when I go in there, that tent is most of the time
[16:32.840 --> 16:34.720]  pretty close to comfortable for those plants.
[16:34.720 --> 16:36.320]  The plants can take it a little hotter than me.
[16:36.320 --> 16:39.200]  They don't mind being a little warmer, being a little sweatier than me.
[16:39.200 --> 16:42.880]  So right inside of that grow tent is just a few degrees hotter than what the room is.
[16:42.880 --> 16:46.960]  It's also a little bit more humid than what the room is, which is perfect for the plants.
[16:46.960 --> 16:50.820]  So I don't focus too much on controlling the environment in the tent.
[16:50.820 --> 16:56.480]  That is going to work itself out by controlling the environment in which that tent is in.
[16:56.480 --> 17:00.800]  So instead of trying to cram a bunch of gear all inside of your five by five tent and wasting
[17:00.800 --> 17:05.500]  a bunch of space, just focus more on cooling the room where you've got the tent and that
[17:05.500 --> 17:08.400]  air will flow into the tent and work itself out.
[17:08.400 --> 17:13.040]  In a large scale, in a professional horticulture environment, we call that a lung room, the
[17:13.040 --> 17:17.620]  room where all the air is treated, where all the CO2 is induced, where all the humidity
[17:17.620 --> 17:18.620]  is removed.
[17:18.620 --> 17:20.000]  That is actually a lung room.
[17:20.180 --> 17:23.860]  But you're going to have to do something because if you're just dumping the air out of that
[17:23.860 --> 17:28.780]  grow tent into the room, that room is going to eventually gather all of the humidity,
[17:28.780 --> 17:29.780]  all of the heat.
[17:29.780 --> 17:33.880]  If you don't have a way to either get it out of the room or cool that room, I simply just
[17:33.880 --> 17:37.720]  leave the bedroom door open where my grow tent is and that air travels throughout the
[17:37.720 --> 17:41.220]  house and mixes with the regular house and it doesn't cause me any problems.
[17:41.220 --> 17:43.340]  It actually balances everything beautifully.
[17:43.340 --> 17:46.860]  In the winter, I use that room to keep part of the house warm.
[17:46.860 --> 17:51.180]  In the summer, I use the regular air conditioning to cool down that grow room.
[17:51.180 --> 17:53.240]  Everything balances out beautifully over the year.
[17:53.240 --> 17:57.720]  Of course, I'm in Colorado, so I don't get that ridiculous Florida humidity and that
[17:57.720 --> 17:59.060]  ridiculous Southern heat.
[17:59.060 --> 18:03.480]  So things may be a little bit easier for me here, which kind of leads me to my next thing
[18:03.480 --> 18:04.700]  to talk about.
[18:04.700 --> 18:10.860]  Your carbon filter will work better and last longer if you run less humidity through the
[18:10.860 --> 18:11.860]  filter.
[18:11.860 --> 18:15.200]  So if you can get that air going through that filter to be a little bit less humid, that
[18:15.200 --> 18:18.780]  will add life and efficiency to your carbon filter.
[18:18.780 --> 18:22.460]  For some reason, when the air going through there is super moist, it doesn't suck the
[18:22.460 --> 18:24.480]  aroma out as well.
[18:24.480 --> 18:28.460]  And I also feel like too much humidity shortens the life of your carbon in your filter.
[18:28.460 --> 18:33.320]  So if you want your filter to last as long as possible, try to reduce the amount of humidity
[18:33.320 --> 18:34.720]  going through that filter.
[18:34.720 --> 18:38.960]  All right, I've got one more quick piece of advice when it comes to growing and grow tents,
[18:38.960 --> 18:41.780]  and that is do not fall asleep with the grow tent open.
[18:41.780 --> 18:44.740]  A lot of people like to open the tent and leave it open so that those plants can get
[18:44.800 --> 18:47.080]  some air so they can breathe a little bit during the day.
[18:47.080 --> 18:51.060]  And then you want to close it up right before the plants go to sleep for their night.
[18:51.060 --> 18:52.500]  Don't fall asleep with that shit open.
[18:52.500 --> 18:53.840]  Make sure you close your grow tent.
[18:53.840 --> 18:57.320]  Make sure you shut that down before the end of the day so that you don't have a major
[18:57.320 --> 18:59.180]  light leak all night long.
[18:59.180 --> 19:00.560]  That will mess up your crop.
[19:00.560 --> 19:03.920]  That will give you the opportunity for hermaphrodites and all kinds of other problems.
[19:03.920 --> 19:09.200]  So set an alarm about 20 or 30 minutes before that tent closes, maybe 15 minutes if you're
[19:09.200 --> 19:10.200]  that kind of person.
[19:10.200 --> 19:13.420]  Just make sure you get in there every day before the lights go off and close up your
[19:13.420 --> 19:14.420]  grow tent.
[19:15.100 --> 19:18.020]  That way it's real easy to get stoned and forget that that thing is open.
[19:18.020 --> 19:21.220]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers, that is my Thursday
[19:21.220 --> 19:23.980]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[21:31.440 --> 21:34.720]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Stoney Scholar.
[21:34.720 --> 21:38.200]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
