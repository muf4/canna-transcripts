[00:17.280 --> 00:19.600]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.600 --> 00:23.000]  It's time for episode number one 47 of the grow from your heart podcast,
[00:23.280 --> 00:27.200]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.200 --> 00:29.040]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.080 --> 00:31.120]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.400 --> 00:34.400]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:34.400 --> 00:37.840]  current state of cannabis, this, my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:39.000 --> 00:40.800]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.800 --> 00:43.280]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:43.320 --> 00:46.120]  I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots
[00:46.120 --> 00:49.760]  band for letting you use their music on my podcast. Big shout to Kat,
[00:50.120 --> 00:52.440]  the entire mystic roots crew.
[00:54.880 --> 00:56.960]  You guys I'm starting this podcast off kind of bummed out.
[00:57.000 --> 00:59.640]  I'm disappointed in myself. I'm disappointed in technology. You guys,
[00:59.640 --> 01:00.960]  I've fucked up. You guys,
[01:00.960 --> 01:05.080]  I recorded a marvelous podcast with the dabbing granny with Brett from Evo labs.
[01:05.080 --> 01:08.200]  And of course our friend, Lindsay, the traveling stoner, uh,
[01:08.240 --> 01:11.840]  this evening I pulled out my zoom age six. I took out my trusty memory card.
[01:11.840 --> 01:14.680]  I threw it in my Mac book and the files are all there.
[01:14.920 --> 01:17.120]  I can grab the files and I can move them to my Mac book.
[01:17.120 --> 01:20.080]  But for some reason, none of that shit is playable.
[01:20.080 --> 01:23.360]  So none of the material that I recorded with dabbing granny will be aired on
[01:23.360 --> 01:24.120]  this podcast.
[01:24.120 --> 01:29.120]  Unless one of my tech savvy friends is able to get this SD card and pull this
[01:29.200 --> 01:32.320]  information off of there in a usable format, because so far I'm fucked.
[01:32.320 --> 01:34.480]  I tried for about an hour. All I did was frustrate myself.
[01:34.480 --> 01:36.320]  I was not able to get it going. Uh,
[01:36.360 --> 01:38.520]  so let me turn down the music and say this a little bit better. You guys,
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.320]  the dabbing granny podcast that I recorded is lost.
[01:41.320 --> 01:44.400]  It's available on her Facebook. We did a Facebook live video of it.
[01:44.800 --> 01:48.560]  But I think that's the only way you're going to hear or see any of that episode.
[01:48.760 --> 01:52.920]  Granny, I apologize. Uh, technology fucked me. I don't know what else to say.
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.280]  Brett, I apologize. Lindsay, I apologize.
[01:55.640 --> 02:00.480]  The bad news is the podcast is lost and gone for fucking ever technology.
[02:00.480 --> 02:04.440]  Aided technology kicked my ass. You can't win every time. The good news,
[02:04.920 --> 02:05.760]  however,
[02:06.120 --> 02:09.280]  is that dabbing granny has got to come back to the show and Brett's got to come
[02:09.300 --> 02:12.200]  back and Lindsay has to come back and we have to do another podcast.
[02:12.720 --> 02:16.000]  I think I want to do a podcast with granny by herself and with Brett by himself
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.600]  and then a podcast with the group together.
[02:17.800 --> 02:20.600]  I think granny should be on the podcast kind of frequently because she has a lot
[02:20.600 --> 02:24.000]  of great shit to say. So I actually think granny needs,
[02:24.400 --> 02:25.120]  she had so much to say.
[02:25.120 --> 02:27.960]  I encouraged her to start her own podcast was something that I actually said when
[02:27.960 --> 02:29.800]  she was here. So I apologize. You guys,
[02:29.800 --> 02:32.800]  I advertised that like we're going to have an amazing episode for you today.
[02:32.960 --> 02:34.960]  It's not going to be the episode that you expected,
[02:34.960 --> 02:37.880]  but I'm going to do my best to make it amazing.
[02:37.880 --> 02:40.000]  So everybody that was on the episode that fucked up,
[02:40.000 --> 02:41.600]  I invite you guys all to come back.
[02:41.600 --> 02:43.120]  It was a great episode. We hung out at the Canyon,
[02:43.120 --> 02:45.880]  Canyon weed smoked so much hash that it was ridiculous.
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.200]  We had a few friends stopped by pop D and chosen one pop D glass art and chosen
[02:51.320 --> 02:54.520]  one glass art showed up and hung out with us, took some dabs. Uh,
[02:54.560 --> 02:55.680]  Aaron hung out for a little while.
[02:55.680 --> 02:58.600]  So shout out to everybody that tried to make that podcast happen.
[02:58.600 --> 03:00.240]  I'm going to move forward and quit talking about that.
[03:00.240 --> 03:05.120]  Let's talk about some positive things. Uh, more positive stuff. You guys,
[03:05.120 --> 03:09.040]  the other night I got to see Joey Coco Diaz at comedy works in downtown Denver.
[03:09.560 --> 03:11.440]  You know anything about me? You know that I love comedy.
[03:11.440 --> 03:14.200]  You also know that I love comedy works in downtown Denver.
[03:14.200 --> 03:18.960]  I think that comedy works downtown is probably the best comedy club on the
[03:18.960 --> 03:20.880]  planet. If it's the second,
[03:20.920 --> 03:24.920]  it's the second best to the comedy store in Los Angeles, California.
[03:24.920 --> 03:28.960]  Other than that, comedy works is the best comedy club in the world. Now,
[03:28.960 --> 03:32.520]  since I'm talking about comedy, you guys, I saw Joey Coco Diaz.
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.840]  That is one of my, that might be my favorite damn comedian right now.
[03:36.120 --> 03:38.840]  That dude blew the roof off of comedy works. You guys,
[03:38.840 --> 03:40.920]  Joey Diaz walked out on stage and he grabbed the mic.
[03:41.160 --> 03:44.040]  Now before he could get to the mic, he got a standing ovation.
[03:44.320 --> 03:49.040]  Joey walked out to a standing ovation. He grabbed the mic and he said, uh,
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.400]  what up you bad motherfuckers. And that's just the way Joey starts the show.
[03:52.400 --> 03:53.960]  And I knew it was going to be a party from then.
[03:53.960 --> 03:58.080]  He had this little strut in his stride the whole time. Joey was killing it. Uh,
[03:58.080 --> 04:00.960]  the show was hosted by a comedian whose name I cannot recall. He was a new guy.
[04:00.960 --> 04:04.120]  He's got some dreadlocks. He's a very entertaining dude. Uh,
[04:04.160 --> 04:08.360]  there's a other comedian whose name I cannot remember who was the opening act.
[04:08.400 --> 04:10.000]  Then there was a feature act. Whose name was Rick?
[04:10.000 --> 04:11.680]  Who I've seen several times is pretty good. He did.
[04:11.960 --> 04:15.240]  So everyone's trying to do a bunch of weed jokes in Colorado. Hey guys,
[04:15.240 --> 04:17.880]  if you're a comedian and aspiring comedian, a touring comedian,
[04:17.880 --> 04:20.080]  if you're a funny guy and you're coming to Colorado,
[04:20.440 --> 04:22.160]  chill out on the weed jokes, we've heard it all.
[04:22.560 --> 04:24.680]  We've heard every fucking weed joke you're going to tell him.
[04:24.680 --> 04:28.920]  Unless you got some super creative weed joke, but we've heard it. Trust me.
[04:29.360 --> 04:32.000]  That's for the pros. That's for the noobs. We've heard all the weed jokes.
[04:32.320 --> 04:35.560]  So the opening acts, they both, all three did a couple of weed jokes.
[04:35.560 --> 04:37.960]  The host did a couple of weed jokes. Joey barely talked about weed,
[04:38.080 --> 04:40.760]  but Joey smokes more weed than you. Joey eats more edibles than you.
[04:41.600 --> 04:45.200]  And Joey still is able to go on stage and put out an amazing fucking comedy
[04:45.200 --> 04:47.600]  show. Joey had me laughing. Joey Coco Diaz, you guys,
[04:47.800 --> 04:50.560]  he is the host of a podcast called the church of what's happening now.
[04:50.560 --> 04:54.320]  He was in a movie called the longest yard. Uh, he's an amazing comedian.
[04:54.320 --> 04:56.800]  He's Joe Rogan's favorite comedian. If that tells you anything,
[04:57.120 --> 05:01.840]  he had me laughing so hard that the sides of my stomach and ribs were hurting.
[05:01.960 --> 05:04.760]  My back was hurting in a weird way. My cheeks hurt.
[05:04.960 --> 05:07.800]  There's a little spot like right behind where my sunglasses would rest on my
[05:07.840 --> 05:08.960]  head. That shit hurt.
[05:09.000 --> 05:11.840]  It felt like someone was just squeezing my head and it was from laughing so hard.
[05:12.280 --> 05:14.040]  And then I told my buddy, I was like, I'm laughing so hard.
[05:14.040 --> 05:16.680]  I think I'm going to cry. And I think Joey might've heard me.
[05:16.920 --> 05:18.880]  Because when he heard, I was going to, when he heard that I was going to cry,
[05:18.880 --> 05:21.640]  I think he just started hitting harder. He's like, Oh, you're laughing now.
[05:21.640 --> 05:25.280]  Motherfucker watch this. Uh, I had tears coming out of my left eye.
[05:25.280 --> 05:26.680]  My right eye was twitching weird.
[05:27.440 --> 05:30.880]  I haven't laughed that hard in a long time and I probably won't laugh that hard
[05:30.880 --> 05:34.400]  again. Cause Joey was fucking incredible. He blew the roof off of comedy works.
[05:34.720 --> 05:37.600]  Much love to Joey Coco Diaz, much love to comedy works.
[05:37.840 --> 05:41.320]  And also a big special thank you to my friend Baker Baker.
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.520]  I truly appreciate what you do for me.
[05:43.520 --> 05:46.760]  I'm always treated like a VIP at comedy works. I appreciate that.
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.360]  Also shout out to my friend Buzzy for buying the tickets. You guys,
[05:50.360 --> 05:54.320]  I got a sweet deal with my buddy Buzzy. Uh, he buys tickets and I drive. Uh,
[05:54.320 --> 05:57.000]  and then we go see comedy shows and it's fucking amazingly fun.
[05:57.200 --> 05:59.640]  So shout out to everybody involved. That was a great night.
[05:59.840 --> 06:01.560]  Shout out to my new friends that I made that night.
[06:01.960 --> 06:05.000]  Let's talk about other positive things that happened in my life last night.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.800]  You guys, I got to see one of my favorite bands,
[06:07.920 --> 06:10.200]  Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band.
[06:10.560 --> 06:13.280]  They were in my hometown of Pueblo, Colorado.
[06:13.600 --> 06:16.760]  They were 10 minutes away from my house at the bruise ale house.
[06:17.120 --> 06:19.000]  All I had to do was drive over there, find parking,
[06:19.200 --> 06:23.320]  march on in and get my reggae on. It was local. It was amazing. Uh,
[06:23.320 --> 06:25.520]  shout out to the bruise ale house. That club is great.
[06:25.520 --> 06:29.960]  It's probably the best venue in Pueblo right now.
[06:30.400 --> 06:32.120]  Uh, there are a couple of theaters they compete,
[06:32.120 --> 06:34.680]  but I'm going to give that place the number one venue for the vibe.
[06:35.080 --> 06:37.400]  Uh, they got a backdoor that rolls up. You're right on the riverwalk.
[06:37.400 --> 06:40.640]  You can see the river right behind you. Uh, the sound is good in there.
[06:40.640 --> 06:44.360]  The vibe is good. It was a great place. The band. Oh my goodness.
[06:44.360 --> 06:48.120]  Joseph Israel and the band tore it up. You guys,
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.760]  I've been seeing Joseph Israel for probably,
[06:49.760 --> 06:52.960]  I've been watching his band for probably 10 years. This was,
[06:52.960 --> 06:54.360]  I've seen several of their shows.
[06:54.720 --> 06:58.240]  I've seen this band progress and come a long, long way.
[06:58.480 --> 07:01.200]  And last night's show was the best show that I've ever seen them do.
[07:01.200 --> 07:03.120]  It was the second to last show on their tour.
[07:03.400 --> 07:06.240]  And you could tell that they just played until they were done tonight show.
[07:06.240 --> 07:08.680]  They're not going to have a lot of energy because they wore themselves out last
[07:08.680 --> 07:12.080]  night. Whoever sees them tonight. I'm sorry. I drained all their energy. Uh,
[07:12.120 --> 07:15.400]  my favorite album from Joseph Israel is an album called gone are the days.
[07:15.400 --> 07:18.440]  I think it was his original release. They played, uh,
[07:18.440 --> 07:19.840]  there were probably 15 songs on there.
[07:19.840 --> 07:21.560]  I think a couple of them are like dub remixes.
[07:21.560 --> 07:23.120]  So there's like probably 10 songs on there.
[07:23.120 --> 07:26.600]  They must've played seven or eight of them. And they played all my favorites.
[07:26.880 --> 07:28.680]  I could yell out a song and they would play it for me.
[07:29.000 --> 07:30.920]  They weren't going to play a song called truth,
[07:30.920 --> 07:33.440]  but truth is one of my favorites. And there was a break, you know,
[07:33.440 --> 07:35.720]  when the musicians are like tuning their guitars and they're all talking and
[07:35.720 --> 07:39.360]  taking a drink, I yelled out truth. And I was like, right in the front row.
[07:39.360 --> 07:41.880]  So Joseph looked at me like, oh yeah. And, uh,
[07:41.920 --> 07:44.440]  they talked about it for a minute and they said, we haven't played this.
[07:44.440 --> 07:45.280]  We don't practice this.
[07:45.280 --> 07:48.640]  We haven't played this since we recorded the gun or the days album.
[07:49.160 --> 07:50.760]  And they started singing the chorus.
[07:50.800 --> 07:53.760]  They just started doing like a really cool acapella harmony version of the
[07:53.760 --> 07:56.400]  chorus. And then once that chorus ended,
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.240]  the guitar player started playing the guitar lick and they played the song
[08:00.280 --> 08:03.720]  truth for me. Uh, it wasn't tight and it wasn't perfect, but you know what?
[08:03.720 --> 08:06.600]  It was beautiful that my friends tried to play that song for me.
[08:06.960 --> 08:11.040]  So much love to Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band and the entire crew at
[08:11.040 --> 08:12.960]  Bruce Alehouse. I had an amazing time.
[08:13.280 --> 08:16.720]  I got to smoke after the show with a couple of the guys, uh,
[08:16.840 --> 08:17.920]  something I should mention.
[08:18.320 --> 08:22.200]  I have been a huge fan of a bass player by the name of Chris Meredith.
[08:22.200 --> 08:24.680]  He plays with Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band,
[08:24.680 --> 08:27.440]  but he's also known as a recording artist in Jamaica.
[08:27.440 --> 08:30.160]  And he's also well known for playing with Steven Marley.
[08:30.720 --> 08:34.120]  Uh, I walked into the building and Chris Meredith was just standing there,
[08:34.120 --> 08:35.360]  talking to Joseph Israel.
[08:35.640 --> 08:38.640]  And I realized he was going to be the blade bass player for the show that night
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.440]  that put a huge smile on my face because he recorded Joseph's album with him.
[08:42.600 --> 08:45.360]  He went on tour for the first tour and then he had to go back to Jamaica and he
[08:45.360 --> 08:48.160]  took off for a little while. So we didn't see him on tour with Joseph.
[08:48.440 --> 08:51.600]  It was great to see Chris and the original drummer back together in the rhythm
[08:51.600 --> 08:52.400]  section.
[08:52.400 --> 08:56.040]  I actually got to meet the original keyboard player from the gun or the days
[08:56.040 --> 08:58.920]  album. We got to talk about the recording. We got to talk about a few things,
[08:59.240 --> 09:01.680]  got to talk about the tough gong recording studio in Jamaica.
[09:01.960 --> 09:04.400]  It's really nice to hang out with some Jamaican Rastas, some, uh,
[09:04.400 --> 09:07.040]  some faithful folks, folks with good vibes, uh,
[09:07.080 --> 09:10.560]  folks with positive energy with good things to say. You guys,
[09:10.840 --> 09:13.520]  I recommend that you listen to Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band.
[09:13.520 --> 09:15.800]  I just talked about him for like five minutes. So we're going to move on from that,
[09:15.800 --> 09:17.720]  but big shout out, much love, much respect,
[09:18.120 --> 09:21.120]  much good vibes from Joseph Israel and the Jerusalem band last night.
[09:21.160 --> 09:24.440]  I had a great time. Shout out to the friend that went with me. I had fun dancing.
[09:24.680 --> 09:27.960]  We got to laugh at some, uh, some crazy drunk people, uh, man,
[09:27.960 --> 09:32.080]  drunk people are super entertaining. I am so glad I do not consume alcohol.
[09:32.080 --> 09:34.320]  Anymore. I just smoke mad cannabis. Uh,
[09:34.360 --> 09:36.560]  there may have been a little smoke session in the back of the club at the end
[09:36.560 --> 09:39.240]  of the night. That was a good time. Shout out to everybody. All right,
[09:39.240 --> 09:42.440]  let's move on to some grow knowledge. You guys been talking about my weekend,
[09:42.440 --> 09:46.680]  and my week long enough. Let's talk about grow knowledge. A few episodes back,
[09:46.800 --> 09:48.760]  I was asked how to handle grasshoppers.
[09:48.800 --> 09:52.480]  And what I've noticed is everybody is getting bombarded with grasshoppers and
[09:52.480 --> 09:54.080]  their outdoor cannabis grow this year.
[09:54.360 --> 09:57.600]  The number one way that you can get rid of your grasshoppers is just to clean up.
[09:57.600 --> 09:59.680]  If you can mow all the grass, mow all the weeds,
[09:59.680 --> 10:02.520]  get rid of anywhere for them to live, get rid of all the stuff for them to eat.
[10:02.520 --> 10:04.200]  The grasshoppers won't want to come around.
[10:04.560 --> 10:08.560]  I understand that your neighbors probably have a big ass pile of grass and leaves
[10:08.560 --> 10:10.680]  and shit in their yard that you cannot do anything about.
[10:10.680 --> 10:13.280]  It's illegal to go over there with the torch and just burn that shit down.
[10:13.720 --> 10:15.840]  So if you're having problems with grasshoppers,
[10:16.080 --> 10:21.160]  somebody recommended to me garlic and fermented garlic sprays to help keep
[10:21.180 --> 10:22.680]  grasshoppers and other pests away.
[10:22.680 --> 10:26.320]  I assume that this would work on most insects and most living creatures.
[10:26.320 --> 10:30.840]  If you ferment some garlic or mush garlic up into a spray and spray that
[10:30.840 --> 10:34.200]  around your plants on and or around your plants and on the perimeter of your
[10:34.200 --> 10:36.880]  plants, most bugs are going to stay away from that.
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.040]  And definitely you will not have any vampires.
[10:39.240 --> 10:40.800]  So if you're worried about vampires in the garden,
[10:41.000 --> 10:44.000]  you could double up on the garlic spray. You'll be just fine.
[10:44.000 --> 10:47.680]  So shout out to the person that told me about fermented garlic sprays and using
[10:47.680 --> 10:51.080]  them in my garden to keep away grasshoppers outdoors,
[10:51.320 --> 10:54.240]  because I don't grow outdoors myself very much, but a lot of our friends do.
[10:54.240 --> 10:57.080]  And I think in the next episode may feature our buddy, Jesse,
[10:57.240 --> 10:59.400]  and we're going to talk about some outdoor stuff. Shout out to Jesse.
[10:59.400 --> 11:00.520]  If you're listening to this, call me, dude,
[11:00.560 --> 11:03.840]  let's plan this episode so we can get it recorded or recorded at my house.
[11:04.160 --> 11:04.920]  We'll use my computer.
[11:04.920 --> 11:07.320]  We won't use the zoom H six because I'm paranoid of that thing.
[11:07.800 --> 11:10.120]  I'm afraid it's going to break and not record the damn show again.
[11:10.160 --> 11:14.400]  So probably won't do that. Ah, grasshoppers. Yes. Emails.
[11:14.400 --> 11:16.920]  I've got some emails here in my phone. People have asked some questions.
[11:16.920 --> 11:18.960]  You guys ask great questions.
[11:18.960 --> 11:20.880]  I want to give a shout out to everybody that sends me an email.
[11:21.160 --> 11:24.040]  I'm going to try to read all of the questions over time on the air.
[11:24.240 --> 11:26.640]  But I'm a little bit backed up. So I'm gonna have to record more episodes.
[11:27.440 --> 11:31.200]  Anyway, here's an email that came from, let's see, how did he sign it?
[11:31.200 --> 11:34.840]  He signed it. Mazar four 20. So shout out to Mazar four 20.
[11:35.120 --> 11:37.920]  His email says, hoping you can read my questions on the show.
[11:37.920 --> 11:41.800]  Been loving the show helps me get through my day at a mind numbing job with
[11:41.800 --> 11:46.160]  robots. Do you work with robots or just like people who are unaware of people
[11:46.160 --> 11:48.280]  who are programmed to act like robots? I'm curious. Anyway,
[11:48.280 --> 11:49.560]  he said questions for the show.
[11:49.880 --> 11:53.360]  When you flip to 1212 or 1113 DJ short style,
[11:53.600 --> 11:57.280]  how long till you want to go from metal halide to HPS?
[11:57.600 --> 12:01.640]  Now I want to talk about this 1212 or 1113 DJ short style thing.
[12:02.200 --> 12:06.360]  What Mazar four 20 is asking is when I change my light cycle from my vegetative
[12:06.360 --> 12:10.280]  stage, either 24 hours on or an 18, six cycle,
[12:10.640 --> 12:12.440]  or maybe a 16, eight depends on where you are.
[12:12.960 --> 12:15.440]  When I change my light cycle to my flowering phase,
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.320]  which would normally be 1212 or he says the 1113 DJ
[12:20.320 --> 12:22.040]  short style. Let me talk about that for a minute.
[12:22.600 --> 12:26.640]  DJ short is a well-known breeder. He's a great speaker. He is an author.
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.840]  He is well-educated and very passionate about the cannabis plant.
[12:30.360 --> 12:34.520]  DJ short breeds amazing strains. He is known for the blueberry DJ short bread,
[12:34.520 --> 12:35.200]  the flow.
[12:35.200 --> 12:38.360]  So there's something in DJ shorts catalog that you have smoked and you have
[12:38.360 --> 12:41.760]  enjoyed. They came from old DJ. Now,
[12:41.760 --> 12:44.320]  DJ does a trick when he is flowering his plants.
[12:44.600 --> 12:47.040]  He does not run them for 12 on 12 off.
[12:47.360 --> 12:50.960]  He does 11 hours on and 13 hours off.
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.840]  His theory on this is that you will see broader
[12:57.040 --> 13:00.560]  variants in phenotypical expression from your plants.
[13:00.640 --> 13:03.120]  So if you're a breeder and you're looking for phenotypes,
[13:03.120 --> 13:07.480]  this extra hour really lets the plants express themselves and show the variation
[13:07.480 --> 13:08.520]  and show their potential.
[13:08.960 --> 13:13.360]  It also will save you one hour of electricity over a 65 day cycle,
[13:14.080 --> 13:15.920]  which is going to be 65 hours,
[13:16.200 --> 13:18.840]  kilowatt hours that you're not spending on your lights.
[13:19.200 --> 13:21.920]  It's also going to be an hour resting off of your air conditioning.
[13:22.360 --> 13:26.600]  It's also going to some people think it increases their yields. I tried it.
[13:27.120 --> 13:29.080]  I didn't like what it did to some of my plants.
[13:29.120 --> 13:32.920]  I did like what it did to some of my plants. So it's very plant specific.
[13:32.920 --> 13:35.920]  It's strain specific. It may be phenotype specific.
[13:35.920 --> 13:37.720]  I have not experimented enough to know,
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.800]  but a lot of people in the community are switching to the 1113 method.
[13:42.080 --> 13:45.560]  It saves money. It saves time. And if you've got the right varietals,
[13:45.560 --> 13:47.520]  it will work for you. One thing I've noticed,
[13:47.520 --> 13:49.920]  some of my heavier sativas didn't like it in the beginning.
[13:49.920 --> 13:51.320]  It took them a while to get used to it.
[13:51.760 --> 13:55.120]  I liked my sativas on 1212 and then toward the end of the phase,
[13:55.320 --> 13:57.200]  that's when I would start dropping down the timers.
[13:57.480 --> 14:01.640]  They didn't seem to really like it when I went 13 hours of darkness right away.
[14:01.920 --> 14:06.760]  So that catches us up to speed on the DJ short 1113 method. Now he says,
[14:06.760 --> 14:11.360]  how long, once you do this flip, do you want to go from metal halide to HPS?
[14:11.360 --> 14:12.760]  That's his first part of his question.
[14:13.240 --> 14:16.600]  Generally I let it go 10 to 14 days rocking the metal halide.
[14:16.840 --> 14:18.560]  When I see the buds starting to form,
[14:18.680 --> 14:21.520]  when I see those little pre buds and the pre flowers just starting to pop up
[14:21.520 --> 14:22.800]  and they're getting a little dandelions.
[14:23.080 --> 14:25.960]  That's usually when I switch in that bulb. If you,
[14:26.840 --> 14:29.280]  if you really want to go crazy, do it three weeks,
[14:29.280 --> 14:32.600]  because I think when you flip those plants are going to stretch for about three
[14:32.600 --> 14:35.280]  weeks and keeping that halide bulb in there really,
[14:35.280 --> 14:37.600]  I think helps prevent them from stretching so much.
[14:37.800 --> 14:41.160]  So keep that halide in there for 10 to 14 days. If you want to go extreme,
[14:41.200 --> 14:44.960]  go 21 days, but you may slow down bud development at that point.
[14:44.960 --> 14:47.360]  I like to switch it in there about that 14th day,
[14:47.360 --> 14:49.280]  because that's when my buds are going to start happening.
[14:49.720 --> 14:54.160]  One thing that you can utilize that I've done and had great success with is mix
[14:54.160 --> 14:55.080]  and match spectrums.
[14:55.080 --> 14:58.840]  Use a little bit of metal halide and use a little bit of HPS if you can. Uh,
[14:58.840 --> 15:00.720]  so I had a, I've got a reflector,
[15:00.720 --> 15:03.320]  it's called the grozilla and I haven't used it in a long time.
[15:03.320 --> 15:05.600]  I should fire it up and do some experiments with it just for fun.
[15:06.000 --> 15:10.320]  But this reflector holds two bulbs and they say not to put more than a thousand
[15:10.320 --> 15:12.680]  watt total in there. It may say 1200 total.
[15:12.680 --> 15:16.240]  So you could put two 600 bulbs in this one reflector. What I did,
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.200]  I put a 600 watt high pressure sodium and a 400 watt metal halide in there and
[15:21.200 --> 15:23.880]  hung that bulb in a five by five hydro hut.
[15:24.200 --> 15:26.800]  And I put nine three gallon pots under there.
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.520]  And honestly I grew some of the most photogenic and most aromatic,
[15:31.680 --> 15:35.680]  most flavorful and most potent cannabis I've ever grown came from that five by
[15:35.680 --> 15:39.800]  five hut with that mixed spectrum light. It was some very impressive cannabis.
[15:40.040 --> 15:43.920]  The only problem was it didn't harvest what I wished it would have. Uh,
[15:43.920 --> 15:47.120]  when I heard when I use a thousand watt HPS in one of those huts with proper
[15:47.120 --> 15:48.600]  ducting and venting and air conditioning,
[15:48.960 --> 15:51.800]  I can pull a pound and a half really close to two pounds.
[15:51.800 --> 15:54.200]  It's hard to hit two pounds in those huts cause you're really limited on height
[15:54.200 --> 15:57.560]  and space. So you gotta like top them out and pull them out real far and train
[15:57.580 --> 15:59.800]  them. You can get a pound and a half out of one of those huts.
[16:00.120 --> 16:03.280]  When I did the HPS, uh, metal halide combo,
[16:03.280 --> 16:07.520]  I got right about a pound and a quarter. So it didn't do what I would expect.
[16:07.600 --> 16:10.080]  I think that 600 watt light kind of didn't let it push,
[16:10.080 --> 16:14.120]  but the flavor and the aroma and the potency made up for the lack of weight
[16:14.120 --> 16:16.440]  because it was for me, I was growing it for my own head stash.
[16:16.440 --> 16:18.480]  So I didn't need a whole bunch. All right.
[16:18.760 --> 16:19.960]  So that's the first part of your question.
[16:19.960 --> 16:22.320]  I would do it somewhere between 14 and 21 days,
[16:22.760 --> 16:25.240]  10 days if you're trying to go early, 14 days is about ideal.
[16:25.240 --> 16:28.680]  21 days if you're really trying to keep those plants short because that's that
[16:28.680 --> 16:32.160]  halide lamp is going to keep them from stretching on you as part of why we do
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.720]  that. So he also says, also was wondering how long, once under 1212,
[16:36.720 --> 16:39.680]  do you wait to switch your nutrients from veg to bloom?
[16:40.640 --> 16:42.840]  And he also says, hope to hear my questions get answered on the show.
[16:42.840 --> 16:44.400]  Sincerely, Mazzer420.
[16:44.720 --> 16:48.320]  So he's wondering how long from the day we switched to 1212,
[16:48.320 --> 16:50.640]  do we wait to switch our nutrients from veg to bloom?
[16:51.280 --> 16:53.040]  I kind of do a slow transition.
[16:53.080 --> 16:58.080]  I believe that your plant is going to absorb somewhere between 80 and 90% of its
[16:59.040 --> 17:02.360]  nitrogen that all, that all of it's going to absorb through its whole life.
[17:02.440 --> 17:04.880]  It's going to absorb most of that through the vegetative stage.
[17:04.880 --> 17:07.880]  Once you hit flowering, once you get to that second or third week of flowering,
[17:07.880 --> 17:09.560]  you're not going to use a whole lot of nitrogen,
[17:09.560 --> 17:12.560]  just enough to keep the leaves green and keep the plant moving.
[17:12.920 --> 17:14.480]  So nitrogen is going to kind of fizzle out.
[17:14.480 --> 17:17.920]  So you can switch the nutrients right away if you'd like to,
[17:18.360 --> 17:22.920]  or you can keep those nutrients going slowly and taper. So if you're,
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.920]  if you've got grow and you've got bloom,
[17:24.960 --> 17:28.840]  maybe go seven to 10 days with that grow before you pull out the grow nutrient
[17:28.840 --> 17:32.600]  and throw in the bloom it, or you can just switch right away. It's up to you.
[17:32.800 --> 17:34.360]  It kind of depends on the strains.
[17:35.320 --> 17:37.920]  Gorilla glue really likes to eat.
[17:38.160 --> 17:41.560]  So I kind of stick with my veg nutrients for an extra week or two with the
[17:41.560 --> 17:45.880]  gorilla glue. Uh, things like flow flow doesn't require a lot of food.
[17:45.880 --> 17:49.440]  Flow will just grow like a son of a bitch. So I'll switch flow right away.
[17:49.640 --> 17:52.760]  When I go 1212 that day, they get fed their bloom nutrients.
[17:52.760 --> 17:55.320]  They start getting basically your first day of bloom.
[17:55.320 --> 18:00.280]  Nutrients aren't very far off from your last week of veg nutrients.
[18:00.480 --> 18:02.440]  So it shouldn't be too abrupt of a switch either way.
[18:02.800 --> 18:07.360]  But somewhere between that first day and about seven to 10 days in is when I
[18:07.360 --> 18:09.560]  will totally have switched from veg to bloom nutrients.
[18:09.560 --> 18:11.960]  It kind of depends on the plant. It kind of depends on what I'm doing.
[18:12.360 --> 18:15.560]  It kinds of kind of depends on the room, the strain, the brand of nutrients.
[18:15.800 --> 18:17.560]  If I'm using botanic care, bottled nudes,
[18:17.600 --> 18:21.280]  my switch from my veg stage to my flower phase, like I said,
[18:21.280 --> 18:25.240]  is not very different. It's a base nutrient. It's cow mag liquid karma,
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.160]  and maybe a little bit of a, what else am I using in there? Uh,
[18:28.160 --> 18:30.960]  potassium silicates. And there wouldn't be a whole lot else. Oh,
[18:30.960 --> 18:33.240]  there's a dog resting on my feet and I just moved my foot and kicked him right
[18:33.240 --> 18:35.640]  in the head. I'm sorry, puppy. I didn't mean to do that, boy. I'm sorry.
[18:35.680 --> 18:38.360]  I apologize. Big shout out to make the dog. You guys make the dogs.
[18:38.360 --> 18:40.280]  Been hanging out with me for a couple of days. The cool ass dog.
[18:40.520 --> 18:42.880]  You guys would like him. Sorry. I just kicked you right in the head.
[18:42.880 --> 18:45.720]  Boy, I feel bad. Everyone on the show. Here's me apologizing.
[18:45.800 --> 18:49.360]  I won't do it again, buddy. I'll pet you. So, uh, yeah, my veg nudes,
[18:49.400 --> 18:51.840]  there'll be some, uh, what did I say? Base nutrients,
[18:51.840 --> 18:55.000]  which would be the botanic care of pure blend pro grow.
[18:55.040 --> 18:56.440]  And then you've got some cow mag in there,
[18:56.440 --> 18:58.840]  maybe a little bit of liquid karma and then some potassium silicates.
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.160]  That's basically my veg mix. I would add something in there for roots, uh,
[19:03.160 --> 19:06.480]  some sort of root inoculate, use whatever you would like. Uh,
[19:06.480 --> 19:11.360]  you can use either the plus life from veg bloom, big shout out to veg bloom.
[19:12.280 --> 19:17.000]  Uh, you could use the rhizome mix that botanic care makes. You could use,
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.600]  what am I thinking? There's a, there's one product.
[19:18.600 --> 19:20.720]  I'm really thinking I can't say the name. OG bio war.
[19:20.760 --> 19:23.040]  Use some OG bio war on that bitch to get your roots going.
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.040]  So add that to it for roots and you got pretty much everything you need there.
[19:26.400 --> 19:27.400]  Week one of flower.
[19:27.960 --> 19:30.600]  You basically want to feed the same thing that you've been feeding for the last
[19:30.600 --> 19:31.960]  couple of weeks of veg, uh,
[19:31.960 --> 19:35.000]  because your plants are just going to start transitioning. So week one,
[19:35.000 --> 19:38.440]  you've got the option at week one to switch out that pure blend pro grow to the
[19:38.440 --> 19:39.280]  bloom formula,
[19:39.640 --> 19:43.160]  or you can do it at the start of week two or definitely do it by week three.
[19:43.640 --> 19:46.160]  Your plants aren't going to need that much nitrogen by week three.
[19:46.160 --> 19:49.040]  And if you keep going with the grow formula, you may burn them.
[19:49.040 --> 19:52.280]  So you can go the first week or two with your grow nudes.
[19:52.760 --> 19:56.160]  And then by week three, definitely switch all the way into your flowering nudes.
[19:56.160 --> 19:58.200]  You don't need to add everything by week three.
[19:58.520 --> 19:59.840]  You really don't need a lot of week three.
[19:59.840 --> 20:01.920]  You can start introducing things slowly.
[20:02.520 --> 20:04.840]  Maybe get some sugars in there at week three. Uh,
[20:04.840 --> 20:07.080]  you don't need a lot of week three by week four or five and six.
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.600]  That's where things really start cracking.
[20:08.800 --> 20:11.440]  That's when you're going to want to start adding bud boosters, uh,
[20:11.440 --> 20:13.240]  whatever you're going to use to make the weight a little thicker,
[20:13.240 --> 20:15.240]  whatever you're going to use to sweeten it up. Uh,
[20:15.280 --> 20:17.160]  four or five and six is when all that shit comes in.
[20:17.160 --> 20:19.960]  So if you're running a strain that likes a lot of nitrogen,
[20:20.120 --> 20:21.720]  keep those nitrogen nutrients coming,
[20:21.720 --> 20:24.800]  keep that base grow new coming for the first couple of weeks.
[20:24.800 --> 20:26.640]  If you've got a strain, that's got plenty of nutrients.
[20:26.640 --> 20:29.120]  If your leaves are nice and lush green, if they're dark green,
[20:29.280 --> 20:30.720]  don't even worry about that. Grow new,
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.520]  go ahead and switch it over to the bloom nutrients. All right.
[20:33.520 --> 20:36.960]  I hope that answered your question. I know I used to botanic care as a, uh,
[20:37.000 --> 20:37.560]  an example.
[20:37.560 --> 20:41.840]  That's the brand that I use in my small batch personal grows for myself.
[20:42.200 --> 20:45.600]  If I'm going to smoke it, it's probably grown with botanic care.
[20:45.960 --> 20:49.880]  I do plan on doing a side by side between botanic care and veg bloom.
[20:49.920 --> 20:50.760]  In the near future.
[20:51.040 --> 20:55.440]  And I will be completely honest about what I see and I will share my experience
[20:55.480 --> 20:59.680]  and my results here on the podcast. You guys make sure you support botanic care
[20:59.680 --> 21:00.520]  and veg bloom.
[21:00.760 --> 21:03.440]  I've used them both in different environments and different scenarios and they're
[21:03.440 --> 21:06.560]  both wonderful products. I can't wait to run a side by side.
[21:07.280 --> 21:11.320]  I've got a five by five hut and another five by five hydro hut in a room with
[21:11.320 --> 21:15.160]  very similar light with the same lights. They're on a flip box. Every 12 hours,
[21:15.160 --> 21:17.880]  one comes on one shuts off. So we've got a flowering chamber.
[21:18.000 --> 21:20.800]  It's always being used. I'm going to do veg bloom on one side.
[21:20.800 --> 21:22.200]  And I want to do botanic care on the other.
[21:22.720 --> 21:25.680]  And I will completely post a ton of pictures to my Instagram and I'll let you
[21:25.680 --> 21:28.120]  guys know how it goes. All right.
[21:28.120 --> 21:31.280]  I want to thank our friend Mazar 420 for sending me a great email that gave me a
[21:31.280 --> 21:33.600]  lot of information to ramble off at you guys.
[21:33.600 --> 21:37.440]  I'm pulling up the next email here on my phone. The next email comes from,
[21:37.440 --> 21:40.360]  he signed it with his real name. I don't know. Now he says, hi, my name's Kelvin.
[21:41.040 --> 21:43.400]  Uh, let's see, let's read this. We have spoken to four,
[21:43.400 --> 21:44.320]  but I have another question.
[21:44.320 --> 21:46.760]  So I live in Oklahoma city where the heat gets pretty hot.
[21:47.080 --> 21:49.600]  It can get into a hundred or above in my garden room.
[21:49.600 --> 21:53.560]  I was wondering if a bigger carbon filter would help me out any right now I'm
[21:53.560 --> 21:57.400]  running a 400 watt high pressure sodium and a metal halide Apollo light with a
[21:57.400 --> 22:00.040]  four inch carbon filter and inline fan.
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.040]  I was thinking about getting an air conditioner,
[22:02.040 --> 22:06.640]  but I don't want to if I can lower temps with the carbon filters during the day,
[22:06.880 --> 22:11.120]  the temps get from 110 to 115.
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.600]  Thank you, Jeff growers love dude,
[22:14.640 --> 22:19.040]  110 and 115 in your grow room. That is tremendously warm for your plants.
[22:19.040 --> 22:23.040]  Your plants are freaking out. Development stops, growth and development stops,
[22:23.040 --> 22:26.360]  production stops inside your plant around 85, 90 degrees.
[22:26.440 --> 22:29.400]  Unless you're introducing CO2. If you're inducing CO2,
[22:29.400 --> 22:33.600]  if you've got very high levels of CO2, your plants can tolerate in the nineties,
[22:34.040 --> 22:36.960]  110 to 115, you're stressing the shit out of those plants.
[22:36.960 --> 22:39.560]  The buds are starting to spread out. You're getting airy buds.
[22:39.800 --> 22:42.440]  They're going to be fluffy. Uh, they're going to be small.
[22:42.440 --> 22:43.800]  The plants are going to be stunted growth.
[22:43.800 --> 22:46.880]  The humidity is probably getting fucking ridiculous in that room with that type
[22:46.880 --> 22:50.680]  of heat. The good thing about this is you're not going to have any bugs.
[22:50.960 --> 22:54.360]  No damn bug in the world is going to want to hang out in 115 degree grow room.
[22:54.920 --> 22:56.640]  So your main question, let's get to the point here.
[22:56.640 --> 23:00.520]  Your question is will a carbon filter help cool that room? No, not at all.
[23:00.520 --> 23:04.400]  A carbon filter does not provide any cooling. Uh, you need to,
[23:04.800 --> 23:09.560]  you need to introduce cooler air into that room and you need to remove the hot
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.440]  air from the room.
[23:10.840 --> 23:14.200]  A fan won't help you because it's just going to blow hot air around.
[23:14.200 --> 23:17.560]  You need to exchange the air. You got to get that heat out of there. Uh,
[23:17.600 --> 23:20.960]  maybe bigger ducting and a bigger blower to blow the heat out,
[23:21.240 --> 23:24.520]  but a bigger carbon filter won't help you cool the room.
[23:24.520 --> 23:27.320]  You need an air conditioner. Uh, if it's a large room,
[23:27.320 --> 23:30.600]  get yourself a window model like the window kind.
[23:30.600 --> 23:32.760]  If it's a smaller room and you don't have a window for it,
[23:32.760 --> 23:35.800]  get yourself one of those portable, uh, rolling air conditioners.
[23:36.720 --> 23:41.200]  I really like the soleus 14,000 BTU portable air conditioner.
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.440]  They do not pay me. They do not sponsor me. It's what I buy.
[23:44.440 --> 23:48.080]  If I need an air conditioner, a rolling air conditioner for a home grow,
[23:48.080 --> 23:53.040]  or a small grow, that's what I go get is one of those soleus 14,000 BTU. Uh,
[23:53.040 --> 23:56.800]  it's a heater, it's an air conditioner and it's a dehumidifier all in one unit.
[23:57.120 --> 23:59.480]  It's a about waist high. It's only about three feet tall.
[23:59.480 --> 24:03.280]  It looks like a little R2D2 you guys. And it's got a duct that runs out.
[24:03.280 --> 24:06.440]  And I think it's got a duct that can come in also if you choose to duct in,
[24:06.440 --> 24:09.400]  but I don't duct in, I just let the air conditioner recycle.
[24:09.400 --> 24:11.680]  The air in the room is where that air comes from.
[24:11.680 --> 24:14.960]  So that air is already cool kind of that's going into the compressor. Uh,
[24:14.960 --> 24:18.360]  and then it blows the heat through a duct, a four inch duct. Uh,
[24:18.360 --> 24:20.640]  and you can Mount that duct wherever you want.
[24:20.640 --> 24:24.080]  I usually board up a window, cut a four inch hole through the window,
[24:24.080 --> 24:27.320]  put a duct mount onto that window and run that four inch air conditioning duct
[24:27.320 --> 24:29.080]  right out of there. Um,
[24:30.040 --> 24:35.040]  that 14,000 BTU unit would be overkill for your 400 watt HPS and your metal,
[24:35.640 --> 24:38.280]  uh, how light Apollo light. Um,
[24:39.120 --> 24:43.080]  I'm assuming that your small grow room is inside of another room since it's so
[24:43.080 --> 24:46.040]  small. And I'm not, I'm not, I'm not worried that you have a small girl.
[24:46.040 --> 24:47.760]  I'm not making fun of you, but I'm just wondering,
[24:48.120 --> 24:50.760]  is this grow room inside of another room? Do you have this?
[24:51.120 --> 24:54.640]  Like did you construct a small room inside of a bedroom or this may be a closet
[24:54.640 --> 24:56.680]  also, but if it's a small room,
[24:57.040 --> 25:00.880]  maybe you can air condition that room a little bit better and then duck the heat
[25:00.880 --> 25:04.000]  out of your grow and just air condition the outside environment.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.960]  So you're bringing in cooler air. You just need cooler air in that room. Uh,
[25:07.980 --> 25:09.680]  carbon filter is not going to cool off the air.
[25:09.680 --> 25:12.880]  A fan is not going to cool off the air. You actually need some free on in there.
[25:13.160 --> 25:15.280]  You need an air conditioner, bro. So I hope that works.
[25:15.280 --> 25:18.040]  I hope I answered your question. Big shout out to our friend, Kelvin.
[25:18.040 --> 25:20.240]  He says we've spoken before. I remember seeing your name.
[25:20.240 --> 25:23.080]  I remember you're reading your email address, bro. Thank you for the email.
[25:23.080 --> 25:24.720]  I encourage you to send me more emails.
[25:25.040 --> 25:28.880]  I will read your questions and answer your questions on the podcast all the
[25:28.880 --> 25:32.680]  time. If anybody wants to send me an email, I would love to help you out.
[25:32.920 --> 25:36.200]  Send me an email. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[25:36.200 --> 25:38.800]  If you want to follow me on Twitter, it's at GFYH podcast.
[25:39.120 --> 25:40.440]  Check me out on Instagram. You guys,
[25:40.440 --> 25:44.560]  I post a whole bunch of quality cannabis photography on Instagram.
[25:44.760 --> 25:49.800]  It's at Irie underscore genetics. Irie, I R I E underscore
[25:50.440 --> 25:52.960]  genetics. Check that out. You guys have to press pause for one quick second.
[25:52.960 --> 25:55.080]  I'm going to take a dab in a drink and I will be right back with you.
[25:57.680 --> 26:02.280]  I just took a big old fat dab of pineapple Jack shatter from Turpex and I
[26:02.280 --> 26:06.640]  dunked it in OG ghost train, Hayes, fresh turps from our friends at Evo labs.
[26:07.560 --> 26:12.560]  And I feel like my brain was put on a rocket and launched into outer space.
[26:13.040 --> 26:15.520]  And then it blew up like one of those beautiful fireworks.
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.080]  And then it all just came back together and floated down into my head.
[26:18.960 --> 26:21.760]  That's what happens when you dunk your dads in turps and you take big old fat
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.000]  dabs. Woo. Shout out to everybody involved in making these turps happen.
[26:26.440 --> 26:31.440]  I had the lab manager from Evo labs on the last podcast and that's the one that
[26:31.640 --> 26:35.280]  the memory card eight and we cannot listen to. So sorry, Brett,
[26:35.360 --> 26:36.280]  I wish we could have done that.
[26:36.400 --> 26:39.000]  But Brett that means you got to come back on the show and smoke some turps with
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.560]  me. I owe a huge thank you to dabbing granny.
[26:41.720 --> 26:43.000]  And I owe a huge thank you to Brett.
[26:43.000 --> 26:48.000]  Dabbing granny showed up with enough turps to dab out an army and Brett tried to
[26:48.800 --> 26:49.640]  compete with that.
[26:50.480 --> 26:53.680]  So big thanks to you guys for showing up to the podcast to well-prepared also
[26:53.680 --> 26:58.000]  thanks to the Cana canyon for letting me invade the small corner of their
[26:58.000 --> 26:58.600]  facility.
[26:58.600 --> 27:02.200]  I had four couches and a table occupied and nobody could hang out in that region
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.160]  because we were doing the podcast. I didn't mind if people hung out,
[27:05.160 --> 27:07.200]  but when they saw the microphones come out and they heard me talking,
[27:07.200 --> 27:09.960]  they all just took off to be polite. I don't mind if they hang out.
[27:09.960 --> 27:10.800]  I like it. I think it's cool.
[27:10.800 --> 27:13.680]  I like the ambience and the vibe in the background. All right,
[27:13.720 --> 27:17.080]  I am rambling like a motherfucker. Hashtag. They like it when I ramble.
[27:17.440 --> 27:21.760]  I wanted to share with you guys a little progress on my most current breeding
[27:21.760 --> 27:24.920]  project. If you follow me, you know that I am a breeder.
[27:24.920 --> 27:26.920]  I am the head breeder for iRee genetics.
[27:27.480 --> 27:31.040]  I am currently working with a male plant that I call a rise.
[27:31.160 --> 27:35.120]  The strain is known as a rise. The male plant himself has been named Solomon.
[27:35.160 --> 27:37.880]  That is King Solomon. He is going to father many children.
[27:38.320 --> 27:41.960]  He will be the grandfather to many children, but Solomon is my male plant.
[27:42.400 --> 27:44.040]  He is a, an arise plant,
[27:44.040 --> 27:48.480]  which is a cross of a golden goat female that was pollinated by a daybreaker
[27:48.480 --> 27:50.920]  male daybreaker came from gauge green genetics.
[27:50.960 --> 27:53.400]  So much love and respect to day to gauge green.
[27:53.720 --> 27:56.520]  The daybreaker is Joseph OG and Kim D.
[27:57.480 --> 28:01.080]  So there's going to be a little bit of OG Kush and Kim dog lineage in there.
[28:01.120 --> 28:02.520]  And then I crossed that too.
[28:02.720 --> 28:05.280]  I put the pollen from that male onto the golden goat.
[28:05.640 --> 28:09.280]  The golden goat is Island sweet skunk and Romulan and a Hawaiian sativa.
[28:09.600 --> 28:11.360]  So you got that tropical tasty flavor.
[28:11.440 --> 28:15.280]  I pollinated it with that cushy skunky funk flavor,
[28:15.320 --> 28:17.920]  a little bit of everything in my opinion, mixed it all together.
[28:18.440 --> 28:20.120]  And it made a strain called arise.
[28:21.040 --> 28:24.360]  I found three or four really great phenotypes of the arise.
[28:24.360 --> 28:27.080]  There's a very golden goat reminiscent phenotype of arise.
[28:27.120 --> 28:30.200]  I do not keep that one because I've got golden goat. It's too similar.
[28:30.240 --> 28:34.920]  I get rid of it. Uh, there's one that's got this sweet, skunky, funky.
[28:34.920 --> 28:37.280]  You can't keep it in a baggie without all your friends saying,
[28:37.280 --> 28:39.520]  smoke some of that weed with me kind of smell to it.
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.640]  That's my favorite female of the bunch.
[28:41.680 --> 28:45.560]  Then there's one that makes really long skinny buds and I don't know where it
[28:45.560 --> 28:47.520]  came from, but it gives you this hazy high.
[28:47.520 --> 28:49.320]  I don't know where the haze came from and the genetics,
[28:49.320 --> 28:53.000]  but it just makes your head melt. Your eyes just get retarded, squinty.
[28:53.280 --> 28:57.120]  You go dumb. You just start stuttering. It's that, that phenotype is great.
[28:57.120 --> 29:00.320]  But you know, there are three or four key, key phenotypes that I've found.
[29:00.680 --> 29:04.240]  I've put all three of those phenotypes, not the golden goat dominant phenotype,
[29:04.240 --> 29:08.960]  but I put my three favorite phenotypes in a room with a male of this same
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.920]  cultivar, but the male of the same strain from the same seed pack,
[29:11.960 --> 29:15.600]  they're all F ones. So I put the F ones, the male and the female in a room,
[29:15.600 --> 29:18.160]  this male, I posted pictures of him to my Instagram.
[29:18.160 --> 29:22.120]  He makes male flower clusters as long as my arm,
[29:22.120 --> 29:25.960]  which is very amazing for a male plant to make buds like this. It's incredible.
[29:25.960 --> 29:29.160]  It's got a little bit of resin on it. It smells very pungent.
[29:29.440 --> 29:33.880]  It's got a hint of vomit to the smell as a breeder. Vomit is a good trait.
[29:33.920 --> 29:38.640]  If you've got a male plant that smells like vomit or feet or a bar trash
[29:38.640 --> 29:41.720]  can, that is a good breeding plant. That's going to pass on good,
[29:42.240 --> 29:46.560]  good aromatic traits. So I've got that male. And then I've got,
[29:46.600 --> 29:47.640]  let's see what else is in there.
[29:47.640 --> 29:50.800]  There is a golden goat female because I'm going to do a little bit of a golden
[29:50.800 --> 29:51.680]  goat back cross.
[29:51.840 --> 29:55.200]  There's a lemon skunk female in there because I want to see what this Arise does
[29:55.200 --> 29:59.280]  to the lemon skunk. And there is a grateful dog female.
[29:59.680 --> 30:02.880]  So there are multiple phenotypes of the Arise.
[30:02.880 --> 30:05.520]  So there'll be Arise F2s coming out very soon.
[30:06.000 --> 30:09.680]  It'll be tested by a bunch of my people before they're available to you guys,
[30:09.680 --> 30:11.680]  but a lot of people get to test them out.
[30:11.880 --> 30:14.640]  Then there'll be grateful dog to Arise, which doesn't even have a name.
[30:14.920 --> 30:16.800]  There will be golden goat to Arise,
[30:16.800 --> 30:19.320]  which would be like a golden goat back cross kind of,
[30:19.640 --> 30:21.600]  and then there'll be lemon skunk cross to Arise,
[30:21.600 --> 30:24.400]  which who knows what that's going to do. That's going to be amazing.
[30:25.560 --> 30:27.200]  Both of those plants make a lot of resin.
[30:27.200 --> 30:29.360]  Both of those plants have a really nice structure.
[30:29.760 --> 30:31.920]  I really see a lot of great things. So I'm excited about that.
[30:31.920 --> 30:35.520]  They are currently, uh, the date today is I'm pressing my button on my phone.
[30:35.520 --> 30:38.640]  It's the 14th. They went into flower on the third. So they're 11 days in.
[30:39.440 --> 30:42.920]  The male plant is getting big old balls. His balls are starting to,
[30:42.920 --> 30:45.680]  you know, when the male plant starts to flower out, the balls point up,
[30:45.840 --> 30:48.280]  but now they're starting to hang. His nuts are starting to hang,
[30:48.280 --> 30:50.200]  which means within the next four to six days,
[30:50.200 --> 30:51.520]  I'm going to have pollen coming out of there,
[30:51.520 --> 30:53.080]  which may be a little earlier than I wanted.
[30:53.080 --> 30:56.200]  So I'm going to move him over to another room to keep him away from the girls
[30:56.840 --> 31:00.360]  because the girls, their pistols, the little, you guys call them hairs,
[31:00.360 --> 31:03.000]  probably the little white pistols, the hairs on the plant.
[31:03.000 --> 31:04.000]  It looks like a dandelion.
[31:04.000 --> 31:07.520]  I want those nice and thick and stout before I put that pollen on there.
[31:07.800 --> 31:11.280]  So I'm going to move this boy to another area just to keep him from dusting his
[31:11.280 --> 31:12.720]  pollen on these girls too early.
[31:13.080 --> 31:15.920]  And then once I see all the girls have their pistols, nice and hairy,
[31:15.920 --> 31:18.840]  nice and furry, almost that tarantula look,
[31:19.120 --> 31:21.680]  then I'm going to bring the boy over there and I'm going to just leave him in
[31:21.680 --> 31:23.720]  the room with them overnight. And then in the morning,
[31:23.720 --> 31:24.640]  as soon as the lights come on,
[31:24.640 --> 31:27.240]  I'm going to give him a little shake and that pollen is just going to dust all
[31:27.240 --> 31:31.120]  those plants. And then I'm going to do that probably four or five days again,
[31:31.240 --> 31:33.280]  or five, four or five days later. I'm going to do that again.
[31:33.640 --> 31:36.120]  Just let the lights come on and walk in there and give them a little bit of a
[31:36.120 --> 31:38.760]  shake and just get that pollen all over all those plants.
[31:38.760 --> 31:40.280]  And when I say a little bit of a shake guys,
[31:40.800 --> 31:44.120]  if you grab a male cannabis plant that is in full flower,
[31:44.160 --> 31:47.440]  that's got pollen sacks hanging off of it, you can flick it. Like, listen to,
[31:47.480 --> 31:50.400]  I'm going to flick the microphone stand. That's all you got to do.
[31:50.400 --> 31:54.240]  You flick it that hard. Pollen goes everywhere, everywhere.
[31:54.560 --> 31:57.360]  So after that, I'll have to take a shower off to change clothes.
[31:58.040 --> 32:01.040]  I'll have to go spray down any female plants that I do not want receiving
[32:01.040 --> 32:04.440]  pollen. It'll, it'll be some work, but it'll be definitely, definitely worth it.
[32:04.440 --> 32:05.360]  I'll have to change clothes,
[32:05.360 --> 32:08.000]  wash my dreadlocks before I go to anybody else's garden.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.200]  I wouldn't disrespect anyone else's garden like that.
[32:10.520 --> 32:13.760]  I'll put on specific clothes that cover me up most of the way so that I can just
[32:13.760 --> 32:16.400]  drop them right in the washer. It's a chore,
[32:16.400 --> 32:18.520]  but that's where my breeding project is. You guys,
[32:18.520 --> 32:21.440]  the male is just getting ready to drop pollen. Damn. I just kicked the dog again.
[32:21.480 --> 32:24.240]  I'm sorry, boy. I'm sorry, dude. I didn't mean to kick you.
[32:24.280 --> 32:25.440]  His head's right here on my foot.
[32:25.440 --> 32:28.040]  So every time I get excited to move my foot and give him a good head kick,
[32:28.440 --> 32:31.920]  this ain't no UFC over here. I apologize. So my plants are,
[32:32.240 --> 32:36.160]  the breeding project is 11 days. The males are just dropping pollen.
[32:36.280 --> 32:40.480]  The male is just starting to drop pollen. The females are almost ready to take it.
[32:40.480 --> 32:42.920]  I'm going to separate them for a little bit just to put some tension in the
[32:42.920 --> 32:46.640]  room. Then I'm going to reintroduce them together in a few days.
[32:47.080 --> 32:48.360]  And then once they pollinate,
[32:48.440 --> 32:51.800]  it's probably going to be about six weeks before those seeds are ready for
[32:51.800 --> 32:55.960]  harvest. I'm going to let them go about seven. I don't want to let them go too long,
[32:55.960 --> 32:59.320]  but I want them nice and done. I want them hard. Then we'll cut down the plants.
[32:59.720 --> 33:03.920]  We will set them all in individual areas over individual containers and just let
[33:03.920 --> 33:06.600]  them dry for a couple of few days. Once they, I will,
[33:06.720 --> 33:08.680]  we'll pre-trim them at that point. We'll give them,
[33:09.160 --> 33:11.080]  we'll just take off all the big leaves when we cut them down.
[33:11.480 --> 33:14.280]  Most of the fan leaves will be gone. So we'll dry it. We'll hang them.
[33:14.320 --> 33:16.800]  We'll let them dry. And then you just take the plants and you cut,
[33:17.080 --> 33:20.440]  basically cut one stick off and I put on rubber gloves and hold it over like a
[33:20.440 --> 33:22.680]  pie plate and just start crushing up the buds.
[33:22.680 --> 33:24.160]  And you can just hear the seeds fall out.
[33:24.160 --> 33:26.280]  It's like you're smoking old school Mexican brick weed.
[33:26.280 --> 33:28.760]  And all those seeds are just going to take, take, take, take, take, take, take,
[33:28.760 --> 33:31.840]  take, take into the pie plate, just crumble them up with my fingers.
[33:32.320 --> 33:35.720]  And then I push all the weed up to one side and I tip the pan and all the seeds
[33:35.720 --> 33:37.960]  roll down to the other side and I take those out and put them in a jar.
[33:38.320 --> 33:40.200]  It gets carefully labeled of what it is.
[33:40.760 --> 33:42.520]  I leave the lid open for a couple of few days,
[33:42.520 --> 33:45.640]  just so that if there's any moisture in there, that those seeds will dry out.
[33:46.560 --> 33:49.280]  So now I've got a Mason jar full of well-labeled seeds.
[33:49.720 --> 33:52.200]  And then once I've got all of them, I'll weigh the seeds,
[33:52.200 --> 33:54.120]  get a good estimate of how many seeds I've got.
[33:54.160 --> 33:58.240]  And then I'll send a lot of those seeds out to friends of mine with a note that
[33:58.240 --> 34:01.480]  says, these are testers. Please test these, take a lot of pictures,
[34:01.720 --> 34:03.320]  make a lot of notes. Let me know what you got.
[34:03.760 --> 34:08.480]  I will give some to local people. And the requirement is if you find a champion,
[34:08.480 --> 34:11.040]  I get a clone of that sucker. If you've got something good, I get the,
[34:11.080 --> 34:14.600]  I get a clone of the best one, please. That's kind of, it's kind of how that goes.
[34:14.600 --> 34:16.840]  So I'll give you some tester packs. It'll be, uh,
[34:17.000 --> 34:20.400]  probably looking at 12 weeks before anything will even be done from this point,
[34:20.920 --> 34:24.720]  but there will be seeds in 12 weeks. There'll be testers. People check them out.
[34:24.760 --> 34:25.960]  I'll post pictures of what comes of it.
[34:25.960 --> 34:27.360]  Cause I'll grow a bunch of them by myself.
[34:27.360 --> 34:30.160]  The dog just got up and left because I kicked him in the head. I'm sorry, boy.
[34:30.600 --> 34:33.720]  Sorry. I didn't mean to kick you. You guys don't ever kick your dog in the head.
[34:33.800 --> 34:38.320]  Love your dog, scratch your dog and breed good cannabis. Ladies and gentlemen,
[34:38.320 --> 34:40.080]  I think that is all I've got for you this week.
[34:40.100 --> 34:41.760]  I wanted to update you on my breeding project.
[34:41.760 --> 34:44.640]  I hope you enjoy following along with my breeding project.
[34:45.040 --> 34:47.320]  I'll give you another update in a couple of weeks and let you know how things
[34:47.340 --> 34:50.760]  are going. You guys, I'm going to wrap up the show. If you've got a product,
[34:50.760 --> 34:52.880]  you'd like me to review, or if you'd like to sponsor the podcast,
[34:52.880 --> 34:54.920]  send me an email it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[34:55.160 --> 34:56.000]  I'd love to hear from you.
[34:56.000 --> 34:58.200]  Make sure you follow me on all of the social media, you guys.

[35:01.960 --> 35:04.720]  search for the podcast section, search the review section. No wait,
[35:04.720 --> 35:06.360]  I fucked that up. You got to go to podcasts.
[35:06.360 --> 35:07.960]  Then you got to go to grow from your heart.
[35:08.280 --> 35:10.760]  Then when the grow from your heart section pops up, there's a little,
[35:10.800 --> 35:12.200]  just a little icon of the show.
[35:12.240 --> 35:16.160]  Click on that one and then go click on ratings and reviews and then type in a

[35:20.640 --> 35:23.840]  episode. While you're there, you've got the option to give me some stars.
[35:24.120 --> 35:26.840]  You know, I want five stars, but I'm not going to beg for five stars.
[35:26.840 --> 35:29.160]  Give me the amount of stars that you feel I deserve.
[35:29.440 --> 35:32.600]  And I would truly appreciate it because I want to thank everybody for listening
[35:32.600 --> 35:35.520]  to the show. Once again, big shout out to make the dog shout out to my buddy

[35:47.480 --> 35:50.200]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[35:50.800 --> 35:54.600]  So many paths, only one road to choose.
[35:54.600 --> 35:58.480]  If you live for yourself, you know,
[35:58.480 --> 36:02.200]  you will lose your heart.
[36:03.000 --> 36:04.960]  Let true love rule.
[36:05.960 --> 36:10.240]  We are made with Godly attributes.
[36:11.120 --> 36:13.960]  Things gonna be right when it's right there.
[36:14.200 --> 36:16.560]  Choose. Yes, we gotta live off now.
[36:17.320 --> 36:19.080]  Yes, we gotta live off now.
[36:19.280 --> 36:20.480]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:21.160 --> 36:24.680]  Gone are the days that I used to stumble.
[36:26.200 --> 36:29.760]  Gone are the days that I used to wonder.
[36:29.760 --> 36:35.080]  These are the days, the prophets stood for.
[36:35.080 --> 36:38.080]  Gone are the days.
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.480]  I am awake like a storm rising.
[36:41.480 --> 36:43.080]  Where do we begin?
[36:43.080 --> 36:45.760]  Some have a lot and most have nothing.
[36:45.760 --> 36:48.520]  Out of the mouths of the babes they suck a pen.
[36:48.520 --> 36:51.280]  Ask them the question brutality.
[36:51.280 --> 36:53.800]  The system not provided for not all we needs.
[36:53.800 --> 36:56.320]  But they want in a luxury.
[36:56.320 --> 36:59.200]  For them living unjustly.
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.400]  Cause enough bloodshed, another youth is dead.
[37:03.400 --> 37:06.200]  Judgment from Babylon's coming true.
[37:06.200 --> 37:08.720]  We give thanks for our daily bread.
[37:08.720 --> 37:11.400]  Yes, my eyes stay fed.
[37:11.400 --> 37:15.120]  Gone are the days that I used to stumble.
[37:16.400 --> 37:20.200]  Gone are the days that I used to wonder.
[37:21.400 --> 37:25.200]  These are the days, revelations spoke for.
[37:26.400 --> 37:28.920]  Gone are the days.
[37:28.920 --> 37:30.920]  I am awake.
[37:30.920 --> 37:33.720]  The world leaders, them are working in vain.
[37:33.720 --> 37:35.720]  They made the millions off the slave trade.
[37:35.720 --> 37:38.920]  Now they bloody the ghettos with guns and cocaine.
[37:38.920 --> 37:40.320]  They blow down the Drake.
[37:40.320 --> 37:45.120]  Lift up your voice, lift up your heart, lift up your spirit.
[37:45.120 --> 37:49.920]  But it's the eternal effort, leave anyone who needs it.
[37:49.920 --> 37:53.320]  Cause he's the ancient of faith, it's him that we praise.
[37:53.320 --> 37:55.720]  He the only one can bust all the chains.
[37:55.720 --> 37:57.720]  We gotta live up now.
[37:57.720 --> 37:59.720]  We gotta live up now.
[37:59.720 --> 38:04.720]  Gone are the days that I used to stumble.
[38:06.720 --> 38:09.720]  Gone are the days that I used to wonder.
[38:11.720 --> 38:14.720]  These are the days, the prophets spoke for.
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.720]  Gone are the days, give me light.
[38:19.720 --> 38:21.720]  They are awake.
[38:40.870 --> 38:42.870]  Famines and pestilence and war they pon the land.
[38:42.870 --> 38:44.870]  Said I know your kingdom is at hand.
[38:44.870 --> 38:47.870]  Earthquake, where you gonna stand?
[38:47.870 --> 38:49.870]  Your house built upon sinking sand.
[38:49.870 --> 38:52.870]  When your enemy happens to be your friend.
[38:52.870 --> 38:55.870]  In love or gone cold, in the land work hard.
[38:55.870 --> 38:59.870]  Give a helping hand, the race might be hard but it must be won.
[38:59.870 --> 39:03.870]  Gone are the days that I used to stumble.
[39:05.870 --> 39:08.870]  Gone are the days that I used to wonder.
[39:10.870 --> 39:14.870]  These are the days, revelations spoke for.
[39:15.870 --> 39:27.990]  Gone are the days, by the law of heaven.
[39:27.990 --> 39:31.990]  I am made children of heaven.
[39:32.990 --> 39:36.990]  I unite rights with ancient, see in the tradition of righteousness.
[39:36.990 --> 39:39.990]  Gone are those days.
[39:39.990 --> 39:43.990]  Gone are the days that I used to stumble.
[39:43.990 --> 39:44.990]  Gone are the days.
[39:44.990 --> 39:48.990]  Gone are the days that I used to wonder.
[39:49.990 --> 39:53.990]  These are the days, the prophets spoke for.
[39:53.990 --> 39:56.990]  Is it right? Are we?
[39:56.990 --> 39:57.990]  Gone are the days.
[39:57.990 --> 39:58.990]  Gone are the days.
[39:58.990 --> 40:05.160]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
