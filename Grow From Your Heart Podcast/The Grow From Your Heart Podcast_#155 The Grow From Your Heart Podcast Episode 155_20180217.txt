[00:01.210 --> 00:24.530]  It's time for episode number 155 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.530 --> 00:25.530]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.530 --> 00:26.530]  That's right.
[00:26.530 --> 00:30.690]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:30.690 --> 00:34.490]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:34.490 --> 00:39.450]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.450 --> 00:40.450]  I'm your host.
[00:40.450 --> 00:41.450]  My name is Tommy Rostageff.
[00:41.450 --> 00:43.010]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.010 --> 00:46.170]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.170 --> 00:49.050]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.050 --> 00:52.170]  Big shout to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.170 --> 00:54.850]  I hope you guys are having a great evening.
[00:54.850 --> 00:56.850]  I hope you're taking some dabs with me, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56.850 --> 00:58.370]  I hope you've got a fat joint rolled up.
[00:58.370 --> 01:01.090]  I hope you've got a blunt rolled up with some hash down the middle of it.
[01:01.090 --> 01:03.130]  I hope you're doing something to adjust your vibe.
[01:03.130 --> 01:04.850]  I hope you're getting nice and iry with me.
[01:04.850 --> 01:10.170]  I just took some big fat dabs of some taffy and cascade nugg run shatter from our friends
[01:10.170 --> 01:11.170]  at Terpex.
[01:11.170 --> 01:12.170]  It tastes delicious.
[01:12.170 --> 01:16.410]  It actually kind of had a sort of a pineapple aftertaste to it.
[01:16.410 --> 01:17.810]  I really enjoy it.
[01:17.810 --> 01:18.810]  Good stuff.
[01:18.810 --> 01:21.890]  By the time you hear this, it'll all be sold out because they sell that stuff really quickly
[01:21.890 --> 01:23.890]  over at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:23.890 --> 01:27.490]  You guys, in this episode, I'm going to address some emails that have been sent to me and
[01:27.490 --> 01:29.610]  some questions that I received on social media.
[01:29.610 --> 01:33.170]  I've got a really good question that I have titled the Terp sizzle.
[01:33.170 --> 01:36.770]  So we're going to talk about why somebody's got some sizzling terps.
[01:36.770 --> 01:40.970]  Ladies and gentlemen, before we get that far, I do need to make a very special announcement.
[01:40.970 --> 01:43.290]  I was talking about getting my hash at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:43.290 --> 01:47.930]  Ladies and gentlemen, I was known as the master grower or the lead cultivator or whatever
[01:47.930 --> 01:50.610]  you want to call it at Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:50.610 --> 01:53.730]  I am no longer involved with Green and Healthy Wellness.
[01:53.730 --> 01:54.730]  We're still friends.
[01:54.730 --> 01:55.730]  I'm friends with everybody over there.
[01:55.730 --> 01:56.730]  I'm still hanging out.
[01:56.730 --> 01:57.730]  Hunt and I are still bros.
[01:57.730 --> 01:58.730]  Amy and I are still bros.
[01:58.730 --> 01:59.730]  Did he say she's a chick?
[01:59.730 --> 02:01.730]  Well, we're still bros.
[02:01.730 --> 02:03.970]  Lindsey and I are definitely still bros forever.
[02:03.970 --> 02:06.050]  Breezy and I were never real close bros.
[02:06.330 --> 02:07.330]  Breezy and I are still bros.
[02:07.330 --> 02:09.250]  So I've got no problem with the Green and Healthy crew.
[02:09.250 --> 02:10.410]  I'm just no longer a part of that.
[02:10.410 --> 02:11.970]  I am moving on to do different things.
[02:11.970 --> 02:13.450]  I want to focus more on breeding.
[02:13.450 --> 02:17.090]  I want to focus more on my stuff instead of working for another company.
[02:17.090 --> 02:18.290]  I had a great time there.
[02:18.290 --> 02:19.890]  I have no problem with those folks.
[02:19.890 --> 02:23.610]  I completely appreciate the opportunity they gave me.
[02:23.610 --> 02:26.730]  We have a different vision and I want to do my own thing to tell you the damn truth.
[02:26.730 --> 02:28.330]  So I'm no longer part of that.
[02:28.330 --> 02:29.330]  Much love to that whole crew.
[02:29.330 --> 02:30.330]  Shout out to Hunt.
[02:30.330 --> 02:32.290]  Shout out to the entire Green and Healthy Wellness crew.
[02:32.290 --> 02:36.250]  I just wanted to make sure that everybody knows I am no longer a part of that company.
[02:36.250 --> 02:38.250]  I get a lot of emails and questions.
[02:38.250 --> 02:40.450]  People ask me a lot of things about the commercial grow from there.
[02:40.450 --> 02:41.610]  I just wanted to be straight up.
[02:41.610 --> 02:43.250]  I am no longer a part of that.
[02:43.250 --> 02:45.370]  All right, moving forward.
[02:45.370 --> 02:47.050]  What the hell am I doing since I'm no longer there?
[02:47.050 --> 02:49.050]  I'm working on my breeding projects, you guys.
[02:49.050 --> 02:50.210]  I have got some...
[02:50.210 --> 02:52.970]  I've been talking about the breeding project here on the show recently.
[02:52.970 --> 02:54.130]  I've got a breeding project.
[02:54.130 --> 03:00.490]  It is about 50 days into flower at this point, which means it's probably close to 35-ish
[03:00.490 --> 03:06.570]  days since it has been pollinated, which means in about 7-10, maybe 14 days, I'm keeping
[03:06.570 --> 03:10.810]  a real close eye on it, I will be able to chop these plants down and I will be able
[03:10.810 --> 03:12.650]  to harvest the seeds.
[03:12.650 --> 03:16.610]  As soon as the plants dry up, I'll pull the seeds out and then I'll be able to let them
[03:16.610 --> 03:20.970]  dry a little bit and then I'll package them up and I'll get them in a few of my friends'
[03:20.970 --> 03:24.570]  hands and we will see what Arise F2 has done.
[03:24.570 --> 03:25.570]  We'll see what comes from that.
[03:25.570 --> 03:29.850]  I've also got a Grateful Dog female pollinated by the Arise male.
[03:29.890 --> 03:32.410]  I'm really excited to see what that's going to do.
[03:32.410 --> 03:36.530]  There's a Lemon Skunk pollinated by the Arise and of course I did the Golden Goat pollinated
[03:36.530 --> 03:38.370]  by the Arise in there.
[03:38.370 --> 03:40.570]  Those seeds will be done in like 15 days, you guys.
[03:40.570 --> 03:41.810]  I'm really excited about it.
[03:41.810 --> 03:42.930]  The seeds are getting chunky.
[03:42.930 --> 03:44.370]  I've been pulling...
[03:44.370 --> 03:47.330]  I've pulled three seeds out total so far just to do investigation.
[03:47.330 --> 03:48.570]  I have to see what's going on in there.
[03:48.570 --> 03:52.130]  I just get a seed in a normal spot of the plant, pull one seed out, clean it up, take
[03:52.130 --> 03:53.130]  a look at it.
[03:53.130 --> 03:54.130]  I actually tried to germinate one.
[03:54.130 --> 03:55.130]  It did not germ.
[03:55.130 --> 03:56.690]  I was just really curious.
[03:56.690 --> 03:58.490]  That's where we are with the breeding project.
[03:58.490 --> 04:03.490]  I have a lot more breeding projects planned and lined up and charted and in my head.
[04:03.490 --> 04:04.890]  I know what the females are going to be.
[04:04.890 --> 04:08.970]  I know what male I'm going to use and there's going to be some heat coming up from the Irie
[04:08.970 --> 04:11.210]  Genetics Gardens very soon.
[04:11.210 --> 04:13.970]  All right, so that's what's going on with the breeding project.
[04:13.970 --> 04:14.970]  What's going on with me?
[04:14.970 --> 04:15.970]  Gosh, I'm going to cough.
[04:15.970 --> 04:16.970]  You guys, I apologize.
[04:16.970 --> 04:17.970]  There we go.
[04:17.970 --> 04:18.970]  Shout out to the dabs.
[04:18.970 --> 04:21.810]  Shout out to Elevate and the new dab rig they gave me.
[04:21.810 --> 04:25.050]  I'm sure I mentioned it on the last episode but they gave me a sweet dab rig with a Lion
[04:25.050 --> 04:26.050]  of Judah on it.
[04:26.050 --> 04:29.770]  I took a fat dab, kind of coughing a little bit but it's a good thing.
[04:29.770 --> 04:30.890]  What have I been doing?
[04:30.890 --> 04:36.330]  On Monday night, I got the honor to go see one of my favorite reggae artists, the master
[04:36.330 --> 04:41.530]  Sizzla Kalonji was at Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom in Denver.
[04:41.530 --> 04:42.530]  That was a great show.
[04:42.530 --> 04:45.170]  You know, there was an opening act by the name of Dubskin.
[04:45.170 --> 04:49.730]  I've never, I thought I had seen Dubskin before and didn't like them but I was completely
[04:49.730 --> 04:50.850]  wrong, you guys.
[04:50.850 --> 04:55.210]  The band that played that night that was called Dubskin was fucking great.
[04:55.370 --> 04:59.370]  Their drummer was very charismatic and played very creative reggae beats.
[04:59.370 --> 05:03.570]  In my opinion, a reggae drummer is either boring or really good.
[05:03.570 --> 05:07.450]  You either lock in and you play reggae beats or you kind of fill in and you do a lot of
[05:07.450 --> 05:08.450]  cool shit.
[05:08.450 --> 05:11.570]  He's one of those guys that gets on top of it and plays a lot of cool shit.
[05:11.570 --> 05:13.250]  I really liked his sound.
[05:13.250 --> 05:15.610]  I liked the way he played.
[05:15.610 --> 05:16.610]  Shout out to Dubskin.
[05:16.610 --> 05:18.850]  They did a great set.
[05:18.850 --> 05:23.370]  Very Colorado-esque reggae is my best way to describe that.
[05:23.370 --> 05:25.770]  Then of course, Sizzla Kalonji came on stage.
[05:25.770 --> 05:28.330]  Something happened when the band switched.
[05:28.330 --> 05:33.730]  When Dubskin left and Sizzla came on, something in the soundboard happened and the drums sounded
[05:33.730 --> 05:35.610]  like shit when Sizzla came on.
[05:35.610 --> 05:36.610]  I don't know.
[05:36.610 --> 05:38.770]  I'm not a sound guy but I obviously run a podcast.
[05:38.770 --> 05:39.770]  I've got a soundboard.
[05:39.770 --> 05:41.170]  I'm a drummer.
[05:41.170 --> 05:44.730]  I was really bummed out when the drums sounded like shit but I tried to get past it, you
[05:44.730 --> 05:45.730]  guys.
[05:45.730 --> 05:46.730]  I tried to look for the good.
[05:46.730 --> 05:47.730]  I was seeing one of my favorite reggae artists.
[05:47.730 --> 05:48.930]  He came from Jamaica.
[05:48.930 --> 05:50.050]  I had to show appreciation.
[05:50.050 --> 05:51.050]  I had to get iry.
[05:51.050 --> 05:52.050]  I had to show some support.
[05:52.050 --> 05:53.050]  I had to get down.
[05:53.730 --> 05:55.730]  Sizzla puts on an amazing show, you guys.
[05:55.730 --> 06:00.570]  That dude put on, he used more energy in an hour and 30 minute set than most of us use
[06:00.570 --> 06:03.050]  in our entire day.
[06:03.050 --> 06:05.850]  He came out on stage in a long sleeve button up shirt.
[06:05.850 --> 06:09.530]  I don't know how long his dreadlocks are but I assume they are quite long but he always
[06:09.530 --> 06:11.410]  keeps them tied up.
[06:11.410 --> 06:15.490]  This dude's always got his dreads and a turban on his head so he's got a turban filled with
[06:15.490 --> 06:19.970]  dreadlocks on his head and he's under the lights at the concert and he's running in
[06:19.970 --> 06:24.930]  place basically for an hour and a half and singing and not missing a beat while singing
[06:24.930 --> 06:27.170]  and this dude was covered in sweat.
[06:27.170 --> 06:28.670]  It looked like he ran through the sprinklers.
[06:28.670 --> 06:29.670]  He was so sweaty.
[06:29.670 --> 06:33.570]  So that dude put out huge energy even though he was kind of frustrated with the sound.
[06:33.570 --> 06:34.570]  I could tell.
[06:34.570 --> 06:35.570]  I'm a musician.
[06:35.570 --> 06:37.010]  I've watched enough stage shows.
[06:37.010 --> 06:38.010]  I've been involved.
[06:38.010 --> 06:41.690]  I could tell that the drummer couldn't hear the monitor mix so he was falling off the
[06:41.690 --> 06:44.210]  beat a little bit trying to listen to everything.
[06:44.210 --> 06:47.770]  That was fucking up the singer and the singer was getting mad and was kind of showing it
[06:47.770 --> 06:50.210]  a little bit but it was a great show you guys.
[06:50.210 --> 06:53.810]  If you ever get the chance to see Sizzla Kalonji go do it.
[06:53.810 --> 06:57.690]  Also if you get a chance to see a show at Cervantes Masterpiece Ballroom in Denver do
[06:57.690 --> 06:59.290]  it.
[06:59.290 --> 07:00.290]  Leave all your fancy shit at home.
[07:00.290 --> 07:03.130]  You don't want to park right there with a bunch of fancy shit in your car though.
[07:03.130 --> 07:04.130]  That's kind of a sketchy area.
[07:04.130 --> 07:05.130]  Shout out to Denver.
[07:05.130 --> 07:07.850]  All right you guys let's talk about cannabis.
[07:07.850 --> 07:12.410]  Let's get to some of the emails that I have received because I've been talking about my
[07:12.410 --> 07:13.650]  stuff for too long.
[07:13.650 --> 07:14.650]  Let's get to it here.
[07:14.650 --> 07:15.650]  I'm opening up an email right now.
[07:15.650 --> 07:16.650]  I'm unlocking the phone.
[07:16.650 --> 07:17.650]  I've got a screenshot of a message.
[07:17.650 --> 07:18.650]  I'm going to go ahead and read the message that I've received.
[07:18.650 --> 07:21.210]  I'll quit clearing my throat.
[07:21.210 --> 07:23.450]  This message came from a friend on Instagram.
[07:23.450 --> 07:29.090]  He calls himself TerpsOnly710 and they said, hey Ross to Jeff.
[07:29.090 --> 07:31.230]  Just recently I was gifted some pure terps.
[07:31.230 --> 07:35.410]  The first time I've encountered these before so I don't know too much besides they taste
[07:35.410 --> 07:36.410]  great.
[07:36.410 --> 07:39.930]  Sorry guys I'm trying so hard not to cough.
[07:39.930 --> 07:40.930]  There it is.
[07:40.930 --> 07:41.930]  I got it out of my way.
[07:41.930 --> 07:42.930]  I cough.
[07:42.930 --> 07:43.930]  Here we go.
[07:43.930 --> 07:47.050]  I get a small dab of some other concentrate then drop a drip of terps on it and it comes
[07:47.450 --> 07:49.410]  out great and tastes amazing.
[07:49.410 --> 07:52.610]  The thing is the terps make the dab sizzle a tiny bit.
[07:52.610 --> 07:56.810]  Not like the 4th of July Tane Brain status but definitely a small sizzle.
[07:56.810 --> 08:00.650]  That wouldn't happen to the concentrate without the added terps.
[08:00.650 --> 08:02.290]  Is this normal they ask?
[08:02.290 --> 08:05.770]  And then they also said any info would be great.
[08:05.770 --> 08:06.770]  Thank you.
[08:06.770 --> 08:07.770]  Long time podcast listener.
[08:07.770 --> 08:08.770]  Hey thanks for listening.
[08:08.770 --> 08:13.990]  And then they say, can honestly say I've listened to all episodes since episode one and I feel
[08:13.990 --> 08:15.730]  like we're best friends.
[08:15.730 --> 08:16.730]  Well we are.
[08:17.410 --> 08:18.410]  We've been listening for that long.
[08:18.410 --> 08:19.410]  We're friends.
[08:19.410 --> 08:24.170]  I've been listening to Chris Hardwick the Nerdist.
[08:24.170 --> 08:28.250]  I've been following Chris Hardwick basically since he was on Singled Out in the early 90s
[08:28.250 --> 08:31.610]  and I've seen Chris Hardwick spiral out of control and ruin his career and then get his
[08:31.610 --> 08:33.050]  shit back together.
[08:33.050 --> 08:36.390]  And now Chris Hardwick is on top of his game and I heard Chris Hardwick say several years
[08:36.390 --> 08:40.890]  ago that all he ever wanted to do was play Red Rocks and I got to see Chris Hardwick
[08:40.890 --> 08:45.250]  at the Oddball comedy tour a couple of years ago play Red Rocks and it felt like I was
[08:45.250 --> 08:49.330]  watching one of my friends reach his goals because I've been following him for so long
[08:49.330 --> 08:53.090]  and I listened to his podcast so I completely know what you mean about us being friends
[08:53.090 --> 08:56.790]  and I agree if we ever meet if I walk past you at an event if we're in the same area
[08:56.790 --> 08:59.930]  you better come say what's up and introduce yourself because we're friends now.
[08:59.930 --> 09:03.010]  All right let's get to the point.
[09:03.010 --> 09:05.490]  You said you've listened since episode number one.
[09:05.490 --> 09:06.490]  Wow.
[09:06.490 --> 09:09.250]  I'm embarrassed when I think about episode one but thank you I appreciate it.
[09:09.250 --> 09:10.810]  Thanks for sticking along.
[09:10.810 --> 09:14.290]  So you asked about Dab Sizzle.
[09:14.330 --> 09:18.490]  Yeah that's understandable and that's acceptable I think as long as it's not going too crazy.
[09:18.490 --> 09:21.810]  The first thing I'm going to say is you might have your nail just a little bit too hot when
[09:21.810 --> 09:24.970]  you're dabbing you might want to let the nail cool if you're using the e-nail turn it down
[09:24.970 --> 09:27.730]  just a little bit if you're getting too much sizzle.
[09:27.730 --> 09:30.530]  But what's happening is I'm going to pick up my little jar of turps here and let these
[09:30.530 --> 09:32.370]  turps talk me through this.
[09:32.370 --> 09:36.010]  The turps are liquid at least my turps are completely liquid I'm holding them in a jar
[09:36.010 --> 09:40.810]  I could pour them out of this little vial if I wanted to they are completely liquid
[09:40.810 --> 09:44.730]  so you're putting that liquid onto your dab and also you might be using a little bit more
[09:44.730 --> 09:49.690]  than necessary if you're pouring it onto there and it's sizzling when you dab it you might
[09:49.690 --> 09:53.490]  be able to put about half of that and conserve your dabs a little bit make it last twice
[09:53.490 --> 09:57.770]  as long and you're still going to get the flavor you're still going to get everything
[09:57.770 --> 10:01.730]  I know how it is I'm excessive too I like to do big fat dabs with way too much turps
[10:01.730 --> 10:05.610]  but if it's sizzling that might be part of the thing but what's happening what's happening
[10:05.610 --> 10:09.170]  is you're just putting moisture on a hot nail and if you would put water on a hot nail it
[10:09.170 --> 10:13.850]  would sizzle sometimes in the summer when you get sweaty and you have to manhandle
[10:13.850 --> 10:17.530]  your shatter with your fingers because there's no other way to pick it up or whatever sometimes
[10:17.530 --> 10:20.970]  a dab will sizzle from that too because it's got moisture from your fingers so all that's
[10:20.970 --> 10:25.810]  happening is basically you're boiling the turps on the hot nail so when they hit the
[10:25.810 --> 10:29.690]  nail it's just like you're throwing some water in a skillet and it's going and you're just
[10:29.690 --> 10:34.610]  getting that sizzle it's not a problem it's not a bad thing you might be too hot you might
[10:34.610 --> 10:40.650]  be using too much turps so just check those two things out or shit honestly if you like
[10:40.650 --> 10:45.210]  the way it works do it that way if that's what you're into do it that way take too big
[10:45.210 --> 10:49.290]  of a dab with way too many turps on it smoke it up but it's not a problem there's nothing
[10:49.290 --> 10:53.370]  wrong with your turps that I know of from that description it sounds like just science
[10:53.370 --> 10:56.650]  happening because I'm gonna take a drink and another dab and hopefully get rid of this
[10:56.650 --> 11:00.810]  uh thing in my throat all right podcast world I should be cool for a couple of minutes thanks
[11:00.810 --> 11:06.010]  for dealing with my coughs my throat clearing I apologize for that all right so I was talking
[11:06.010 --> 11:09.770]  about turp sizzle you should be cool I don't think you have too much of a problem there
[11:09.770 --> 11:13.370]  thank you for the message if you have any more questions about your turps please send
[11:13.370 --> 11:16.770]  that message to me I would love to hear more about your turps what kind of turps are you
[11:16.770 --> 11:21.850]  dabbing where'd you get them and are you sure those are cannabis derived terpenes that's
[11:21.850 --> 11:27.250]  what I want to know all right our next email came from Mazar 421 and he says greetings
[11:27.250 --> 11:30.570]  this is Rasta Jeff I have a couple of questions for you I was hoping to hear your thoughts
[11:30.570 --> 11:35.170]  on question number one I'm always reading and researching on cannabis cultivation for
[11:35.170 --> 11:39.290]  endless hours I was hoping you could list your top three books that you have found a
[11:39.290 --> 11:46.770]  lot of good information from or have heard good things about I really love this question
[11:46.770 --> 11:50.570]  I love going to the internet for answers but the problem with the internet is that anybody
[11:50.570 --> 11:55.050]  can post anything and I find a lot of bullshit posted on the internet and I see people giving
[11:55.050 --> 11:59.290]  people advice that is just going to lead to more problems and they're not getting to
[11:59.290 --> 12:03.090]  the root of the evil they're like hey I've got this problem and they're like well then
[12:03.090 --> 12:07.210]  do this and I'm like oh shit that's just gonna make the problem you've got even worse and
[12:07.210 --> 12:12.090]  cause three more problems down the line that you're not aware of so I try to teach new
[12:12.090 --> 12:16.210]  growers to avoid the internet a little bit because the internet can be really full of
[12:16.210 --> 12:21.830]  shit so the way to go is trusted books from trusted authors if you want to know three
[12:21.830 --> 12:27.470]  books I would highly recommend the first one I would recommend for everybody is called
[12:27.470 --> 12:33.230]  marijuana botany an advanced study the propagation and breeding of distinctive cannabis and I
[12:33.230 --> 12:39.230]  know that's a really long title but if you go to amazon.com and you search for marijuana
[12:39.230 --> 12:46.750]  botany by Robert Connell Clark you will find that book it's less than $20 with free shipping
[12:46.750 --> 12:51.810]  so that's the book I would start with marijuana botany by Robert Connell Clark then I would
[12:51.810 --> 12:57.050]  go with another trusted classic I would go with the marijuana horticulture indoor outdoor
[12:57.050 --> 13:00.410]  medical growers Bible from Jorge Cervantes.
[13:00.410 --> 13:04.410]  Jorge is kind of old school actually both of the authors I've told you about are kind
[13:04.410 --> 13:07.290]  of old school all three of the authors I'm going to tell you about are kind of old school
[13:07.290 --> 13:11.210]  they've started they started growing cannabis and breeding cannabis probably before I was
[13:11.210 --> 13:14.930]  born so these guys have been doing it for a long time a lot of their techniques are
[13:14.930 --> 13:20.770]  very old and they seem a little outdated but this plant has been around forever and these
[13:20.770 --> 13:24.850]  guys were doing it right back then and this shit still works and it's like karate you
[13:24.850 --> 13:29.650]  got to learn the basics you start off as a white belt and your goal is to get that that
[13:29.650 --> 13:33.610]  crystal the green belt so you got to start off as a white belt get these books get a
[13:33.610 --> 13:37.450]  good foundation and then build on that from there so the first book again was marijuana
[13:37.450 --> 13:41.970]  botany by Robert Connell Clark the second book is the marijuana horticulture indoor
[13:41.970 --> 13:46.810]  outdoor medical growers Bible from Jorge Cervantes they keep updating that book I'm sure you
[13:46.810 --> 13:52.290]  can find it on Amazon for like 20 bucks then the third book I would recommend is Ed Rosenthal's
[13:52.290 --> 13:57.610]  marijuana growers handbook which is actually the Oakster Dam course guide it is the book
[13:57.610 --> 14:03.530]  that they use at Oakster Dam in California to teach people how to grow cannabis professionally
[14:03.530 --> 14:08.610]  this book is very in-depth and I really like the way it's laid out it teaches you the basics
[14:08.610 --> 14:13.090]  of how to set up a grow excuse me how to set up a grow how to maintain your setup what
[14:13.090 --> 14:18.130]  size of a grow to set up it teaches you about how to find males and females it teaches you
[14:18.130 --> 14:22.810]  about cloning vegging flowering teaches you how to look for bugs how to identify bugs
[14:22.810 --> 14:28.510]  this is a great book it's Ed Rosenthal's marijuana growers handbook and then it's also known
[14:28.510 --> 14:34.650]  as your complete guide for medical marijuana that one I'm looking at it right now on Amazon
[14:34.650 --> 14:39.970]  for $23.99 with $4.99 shipping I'm sure if I shopped around a little bit we could find
[14:39.970 --> 14:44.250]  it for cheaper those are the first three books I would start with then there's a book by Soma
[14:44.250 --> 14:48.450]  that I really like I do not have the book sitting next to me right now but it's a small thin
[14:48.450 --> 14:53.930]  paperback cannabis book from Soma then DJ Shore also wrote a book by the same publisher that
[14:53.930 --> 15:00.210]  Soma's book is out from then there's also a book called let's grow a pound which is a very useful
[15:00.210 --> 15:06.290]  book in my opinion it's called let's grow a pound from Seymour Buds I think that book would do every
[15:06.450 --> 15:12.330]  some justice it goes from day one of the grow all the way up to harvest is a very helpful guide and
[15:12.330 --> 15:17.330]  while I'm thinking about it let's throw in a book called secrets of the West Coast masters by a dude
[15:17.330 --> 15:21.250]  named Drew West that should be plenty of books to get you started you can find a lot of those
[15:21.250 --> 15:25.490]  books on PDF form for free on the internet somewhere just a quick search and you should
[15:25.490 --> 15:29.970]  be able to find them all of those books will be available on Amazon and if you have any questions
[15:29.970 --> 15:34.570]  that you need answered with more depth or if you need more interaction feel free to send me more
[15:34.570 --> 15:40.170]  questions I will answer them you know my email address it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[15:40.170 --> 15:45.650]  those are my favorite books let's get to part two of your question part two of your question goes
[15:45.650 --> 15:51.370]  like this I have read that digital ballast can mess with and disrupt radio signals like ham radio and
[15:51.370 --> 15:55.970]  Wi-Fi cable reception do you know this to be true have you heard you are all right as long as they
[15:55.970 --> 16:00.850]  have something called an RF shield and then he says thanks again for the love on the show and
[16:00.850 --> 16:05.170]  keep dabbing and sipping on that drink that's funny because I said I need a little sip one time
[16:05.170 --> 16:09.290]  I knew somebody was gonna give me shit about that thanks for paying attention so let's talk about
[16:09.290 --> 16:16.290]  digital ballasts that mess with and disrupt radio signals that is possible they do put off a
[16:16.290 --> 16:21.770]  frequency and if that frequency matches your TV or your radio it could definitely cause interference
[16:21.770 --> 16:29.210]  or be picked up by something the thing is most did most of the digital ballasts available work at a
[16:29.290 --> 16:34.970]  much higher frequency than what most personal electronics would work at so most of them are
[16:34.970 --> 16:41.090]  in the 200 range and most of your personal appliances are in the 60 range so you should
[16:41.090 --> 16:46.730]  not have any problem when it does happen you are usually using a lot of ballast like more than 15
[16:46.730 --> 16:51.490]  or 20 that would take enough that would be enough ballast to disrupt some signal or when you're
[16:51.490 --> 16:56.890]  getting imported Chinese ballast that are poorly made from other countries and they have a lower
[16:56.970 --> 17:03.130]  frequency vibration and those will be more likely to cause a problem the thing that people are
[17:03.130 --> 17:07.730]  worried about is that they're putting off an RF frequency and that frequency is able to be picked
[17:07.730 --> 17:13.970]  up by law enforcement so that makes a lot of people paranoid most of the new ballasts are
[17:13.970 --> 17:19.730]  made with an RF shield inside of them and they're at such a high frequency that it will not disrupt
[17:19.730 --> 17:24.450]  your household appliances it will not disrupt your Wi-Fi back in the day that was a thing but
[17:24.450 --> 17:29.850]  they've kind of solved that problem now so you should be cool an alternative to the new digital
[17:29.850 --> 17:32.890]  ballast you could go with your old magnetic ballast the problem with those is it's hard to
[17:32.890 --> 17:37.490]  take good photography they make your pictures look like shit so that's your option you can either
[17:37.490 --> 17:42.290]  have the digitals and you can be paranoid about the RF frequency or you can have those old magnetics
[17:42.290 --> 17:45.730]  and you can take shitty pictures but I really don't think you have anything to worry about
[17:45.730 --> 17:52.210]  most of the new ballasts you should be just fine in my opinion there's a huge article on THC farmer
[17:52.210 --> 17:56.650]  about this if you want to read about it on THC farmer that's where I did my research a lot of
[17:56.650 --> 18:02.450]  those guys bicker about it but from what I read I think we'll all be okay with our digital ballasts
[18:02.450 --> 18:06.890]  all right dude I truly appreciate your interaction and your emails I'll keep dabbing and sipping on
[18:06.890 --> 18:13.130]  that drink if you keep sending me good emails like this I appreciate your message Mazar421
[18:13.130 --> 18:18.210]  all right I've got another email this one comes from our friend Artie and he says hey Ross to
[18:18.210 --> 18:22.570]  Jeff don't remember the episode but you mentioned a female plant dying as soon as you put it in the
[18:22.570 --> 18:28.130]  room with the girls well I had the same exact thing happen except my damn killer male plant
[18:28.130 --> 18:34.330]  shriveled up and died within 48 hours of entering the room any idea on either situation thanks for
[18:34.330 --> 18:41.770]  the show again hope to see that black cherry chem soon Artie so a long time ago I did a breeding
[18:41.890 --> 18:49.130]  project where I had a reversed was I putting the okay I had a reversed golden goat in the room so
[18:49.130 --> 18:54.570]  I had a golden goat that was a female I applied silver thiosulfate to it for about 14 days before
[18:54.570 --> 18:59.730]  I put it into flower I put it into flower I continued applying silver thiosulfate to this
[18:59.730 --> 19:07.010]  plant this golden goat plant became a male that produced male pollen this is how I make feminized
[19:07.250 --> 19:13.450]  so I put female plants in that room so that they can receive that pollen and so that everybody so
[19:13.450 --> 19:17.130]  I put I time the plants differently some plants go in early some plants go in later for breeding
[19:17.130 --> 19:23.770]  so I put the plants in most of the girls looked great I put a clone of headband in that room to
[19:23.770 --> 19:29.530]  flower it was a female and it looked okay as soon as the pollen from that reversed golden
[19:29.690 --> 19:37.210]  plant hit that female headband plant that plant shriveled up and died overnight and I do not know
[19:37.210 --> 19:41.490]  what caused it because all of the plants in that room got treated the same everything was the same
[19:41.490 --> 19:47.210]  the feed was the same the amount of water they got was basically the same nobody was overfed
[19:47.210 --> 19:52.410]  nobody was underfed nobody was over or underwatered everything seemed legit in there the temperature
[19:52.410 --> 19:57.090]  was cool there weren't bugs in there everything was cool but for some reason when the pollen hit
[19:57.090 --> 20:01.250]  that plant the whole plant fucking died and I have no idea what caused it I've talked to other
[20:01.250 --> 20:05.010]  breeders about it and they all scratch their heads and look at me like I'm crazy and they're like I
[20:05.010 --> 20:09.450]  don't know something else was wrong and I something I don't know what happened honestly so this guy
[20:09.450 --> 20:14.890]  said he had something similar happen he said his killer male plant shriveled up and died within 48
[20:14.890 --> 20:22.410]  hours of entering the room any idea on that um that's really weird so you took a male plant from
[20:22.410 --> 20:27.570]  a bedroom and then you put it into the flowering room to initiate flower and within 48 hours it
[20:27.570 --> 20:34.370]  straight-up croaked and died I do not know offhand what would cause that I've got a few guesses first
[20:34.370 --> 20:40.210]  I would like to know was that plant is this a soil or a hydro grow that's something that I really am
[20:40.210 --> 20:47.610]  curious about because soil is much more forgiving and hydro you have more option to damage the roots
[20:47.610 --> 20:52.170]  and everything happens much more quickly in hydro so that would explain a little bit more if it were
[20:52.170 --> 20:59.330]  hydro but my main questions did it go from like a t5 light to right underneath a thousand watt light
[20:59.330 --> 21:04.850]  because that may have been a little bit much you may have just fucking microwaved it or barbecued
[21:04.850 --> 21:09.010]  it or broiled it however you want to put it you may have just put that little tiny plant that
[21:09.010 --> 21:13.730]  came from a t5 or a little fluorescent if you moved it to a thousand and put the thousand too
[21:13.730 --> 21:18.490]  close you might have roasted it you might uh you might have just overpowered it wasn't ready for
[21:18.490 --> 21:23.210]  all that you gave it too much energy and it died it may have gotten too high it may have had too
[21:23.210 --> 21:28.930]  little light also you may have gone from your thousand watt in your bedroom where there was
[21:28.930 --> 21:33.130]  only that one plant you had all the space and then you put it in the other room and it was not getting
[21:33.130 --> 21:37.010]  enough light maybe that killed it maybe it was overcrowded maybe you hit it between a bunch of
[21:37.010 --> 21:43.210]  girls and it didn't get enough air that's possible but maybe it got too hot maybe it got too cold
[21:43.210 --> 21:47.330]  maybe it got too wet before you carried it into the flower room or when you put it in the flower
[21:47.450 --> 21:52.170]  did you get excited and over water it you're like this sucker is gonna be a beast and you over water
[21:52.170 --> 21:58.290]  it or did you overfeed it or did it need nutrients I don't know your room if I had if I could walk
[21:58.290 --> 22:02.930]  into your grow room and look at the room and the other plants that's another question I need to ask
[22:02.930 --> 22:08.090]  myself how do the other plants look do you have other plants in that room do you have females in
[22:08.090 --> 22:12.690]  there that look happy because if the females in the room look happy then it's just this one plant
[22:12.690 --> 22:16.450]  we got to figure out but if all the plants are shitty then it's the room we have to figure out
[22:16.690 --> 22:21.170]  so there are a lot of questions I wish I could walk into the room with plants and see what's
[22:21.170 --> 22:25.770]  going on in there I wish I could just walk in take a quick look around the entire room look
[22:25.770 --> 22:29.930]  at your ducting look at your lighting look at your source of fresh air look at how you're getting
[22:29.930 --> 22:34.570]  rid of the old air look at how you're handling humidity there are a lot of things I would like
[22:34.570 --> 22:39.330]  to see in there that would help me answer this unfortunately I'm not able to view your room
[22:39.330 --> 22:43.330]  through my brain yet in the fucking future that'll be so handy when we can do that I'll just teleport
[22:43.330 --> 22:47.730]  to your room I'll check it out right quick tell you what's going on but I can't do that so if you
[22:47.730 --> 22:51.690]  want to send me some pictures or send me some follow-ups to all of the stuff that I just said
[22:51.690 --> 22:56.130]  I will talk about it further on the show let me know what's going on because it is really strange
[22:56.130 --> 23:01.210]  that you put a plant into a room and it died within 48 hours check on all the things that I
[23:01.210 --> 23:05.210]  asked you probably checked all that you sound like an experienced grower that was probably all the
[23:05.210 --> 23:10.570]  stuff you went to right away but check that out if it was hydro and you moved it from another room
[23:10.570 --> 23:14.570]  to another room I'm assuming there was some root damage is what caused that plant to die because
[23:14.570 --> 23:22.630]  last night I transplanted a medium amount of clones from an easy cloner into solo cups with
[23:22.630 --> 23:28.330]  soil and I got kind of hasty and I was in a hurry and I felt myself kind of fuck one up when I pushed
[23:28.330 --> 23:32.890]  the soil down I felt it pressed too hard and I've kind of felt the roots crush today that plants all
[23:32.890 --> 23:38.250]  drooped over it looks really pissed off it may pull through it may die I can spare that clone it's not
[23:38.250 --> 23:45.050]  a big deal I like having a hundred percent success I'm gonna have 99 because of that fucker but just
[23:45.050 --> 23:50.930]  a little bit of root damage on a hydro plant is a huge difference in happiness compared to just a
[23:50.930 --> 23:55.250]  soil plant you can't mess up the roots as much on a soil plant is what I'm getting that I guess the
[23:55.250 --> 23:58.650]  bottom line is I really don't know what caused your plant to die I wish I had a better answer
[23:58.650 --> 24:04.010]  for you I really hope you had a clone of that male plant if not you just got to get some seeds and do
[24:04.010 --> 24:08.610]  some morphine oh hunting when you email me back let me know what strain you were working with and
[24:08.610 --> 24:13.410]  how many seeds you went through to find that male I've got questions for you also and we'll talk
[24:13.410 --> 24:18.490]  about this more on a future episode alright already I want to thank you once again for that email I
[24:18.490 --> 24:25.650]  hope to hear back from you you guys I received two emails one was about LEC that's light emitting
[24:25.650 --> 24:31.730]  ceramic lighting the new 315 seemed to be really popular the company that makes the 315 is just to
[24:31.730 --> 24:36.970]  put out a smaller version lower wattage light I haven't paid too much attention to that I need to
[24:36.970 --> 24:43.010]  do some research on it also I got an email about LED light emitting diode lighting honestly you
[24:43.010 --> 24:48.530]  guys I have never grown with an LED I have never grown with an LEC I have used some t5s and some
[24:48.530 --> 24:54.090]  thousand watt HBS and some thousand watt metal halides that's how I've grown I've done some
[24:54.090 --> 25:00.230]  fours and sixes but I mean I've never done anything other than high intensity discharge lighting so
[25:00.310 --> 25:05.470]  I'm going to find the people that make the 315s you guys if you can put me in touch with the guy
[25:05.470 --> 25:10.150]  that makes the 315s I'd love to get him on the podcast let him know have him email me grow from

[25:26.350 --> 25:31.710]  and maybe run us through the differences of LED lighting and HID lighting because I honestly don't
