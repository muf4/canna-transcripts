[00:00.000 --> 00:05.380]  Hey everybody, welcome to episode 468 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.380 --> 00:09.000]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.000 --> 00:13.980]  If you need new regular, feminized, or autoflower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds
[00:13.980 --> 00:21.460]  Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:21.460 --> 00:25.180]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.180 --> 00:29.840]  Today I've been taking dabs of India Pale, full spectrum extract from our friends at
[00:29.840 --> 00:31.160]  Green Dot Labs.
[00:31.160 --> 00:34.020]  This is a blend of ruby red and peel your face.
[00:34.020 --> 00:38.620]  On the label, the flavor is described as hops, fuel, and grapefruit rind.
[00:38.620 --> 00:40.280]  I'm not sure I get the hops.
[00:40.280 --> 00:42.660]  There is certainly a fuel-y afterflavor.
[00:42.660 --> 00:47.320]  The grapefruit rind is absolutely there, but I get more of a strawberry and watermelon
[00:47.320 --> 00:48.860]  sort of a flavor and aroma.
[00:48.860 --> 00:52.420]  I'm going to give it a fresh smell right now just so I can give you an accurate updated
[00:52.420 --> 00:53.420]  description.
[00:54.140 --> 00:58.540]  Yeah, it has definitely got the watermelon, strawberry notes to begin with.
[00:58.540 --> 01:02.780]  It ends with the hops, then that grapefruit rind kind of takes over at the end there,
[01:02.780 --> 01:05.740]  and then there is a lingering hint of fuel at the end.
[01:05.740 --> 01:09.940]  But honestly, I would have put watermelon and strawberry in the description.
[01:09.940 --> 01:11.180]  It does pack a nice punch.
[01:11.180 --> 01:18.580]  The potency label says that this product contains 68.09% THC, non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:18.580 --> 01:19.580]  It does pack a nice punch.
[01:19.580 --> 01:24.660]  It gives me a nice buzz, but the part that really stands out is that delicious, sweet,
[01:24.660 --> 01:25.660]  strawberry candy flavor.
[01:25.660 --> 01:31.420]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious India Pale Full Spectrum
[01:31.420 --> 01:33.100]  Extract.
[01:33.100 --> 01:36.060]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:36.060 --> 01:41.300]  Before we get there, I would like to do a couple of shout outs to our friends from Patreon.
[01:41.300 --> 01:44.300]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you
[01:44.300 --> 01:45.300]  to our friend Gabriel.
[01:45.780 --> 01:49.660]  I also want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast fist bump and a thank you to
[01:49.660 --> 01:51.500]  our new friend JM.
[01:51.500 --> 01:54.940]  Also a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you to Jacob W.
[01:54.940 --> 01:57.140]  Of course, a big thank you to Keith K.
[01:57.140 --> 02:00.100]  Also, I want to send a big thank you to Willie's armpit.
[02:00.100 --> 02:03.500]  Of course, I always want to send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you to
[02:03.500 --> 02:04.500]  Tommy.
[02:04.500 --> 02:09.740]  And last but certainly not least, I owe a big high five, a fist bump, a Grow From Your
[02:09.740 --> 02:15.420]  Heart podcast shout out, a hug, and a thank you to our buddy Stabby McStabwood.
[02:15.420 --> 02:20.020]  Big shout out, big thank you to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[02:20.020 --> 02:26.860]  And if you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[02:26.860 --> 02:28.900]  slash growfromyourheart.
[02:28.900 --> 02:32.860]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:32.860 --> 02:37.140]  Now I am going to read a couple of listener emails in this episode, but I do need to apologize
[02:37.140 --> 02:40.980]  because I'm realizing as I record that I sound like I am getting a head cold.
[02:40.980 --> 02:44.420]  I did not know it was happening until I put these headphones on and started recording.
[02:44.420 --> 02:46.780]  I sound like shit and I apologize for that.
[02:46.780 --> 02:50.700]  So if you have noticed that my voice sounds fucking terrible, I apologize.
[02:50.700 --> 02:53.440]  If you haven't noticed, don't notice, don't pay attention.
[02:53.440 --> 02:54.440]  It's not a thing.
[02:54.440 --> 03:00.460]  Anyway, let's get to the first email in this episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:00.460 --> 03:05.140]  This email comes from a friend who calls themselves the King of Prussia and the message goes a
[03:05.140 --> 03:06.140]  lot like this.
[03:06.140 --> 03:08.300]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[03:08.300 --> 03:11.620]  After listening to the podcast for the last few months and learning an insane amount of
[03:11.620 --> 03:14.060]  info, I figured it was time to join Patreon.
[03:14.060 --> 03:15.660]  Hey, thank you for joining Patreon.
[03:15.660 --> 03:16.980]  I appreciate that.
[03:16.980 --> 03:19.300]  I'm glad you were able to learn a bunch of stuff.
[03:19.300 --> 03:22.060]  It says you can use King of Prussia for this shout out.
[03:22.060 --> 03:23.060]  What's up Wilson?
[03:23.060 --> 03:24.060]  Good to meet you.
[03:24.060 --> 03:27.620]  It goes on to say, been listening to your podcast a whole lot lately and I've been loving
[03:27.620 --> 03:29.380]  the show and all of the info.
[03:29.380 --> 03:30.380]  It is truly appreciated.
[03:30.380 --> 03:32.840]  Hey, thank you for the big shout out.
[03:32.840 --> 03:36.560]  Thanks for listening and thanks for the words of encouragement and for noticing that I'm
[03:36.560 --> 03:38.600]  trying hard and for appreciating it.
[03:38.600 --> 03:39.600]  So that means a lot.
[03:39.600 --> 03:43.920]  It says, I'm listening to the episode from Friday and the vape pin through security topic
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.840]  gave me a good laugh.
[03:45.840 --> 03:50.320]  So if you've been listening to the podcast, you heard me talk about taking my vape pins
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.080]  through security, getting them into some concerts, having a good time with my Green Dot Labs
[03:55.080 --> 03:57.640]  full spectrum extract vape pins here.
[03:57.640 --> 04:00.720]  I was able to heavily medicate at some fish concerts.
[04:00.720 --> 04:05.840]  I was able to well medicate at a Tom Segura comedy show recently, but without those vape
[04:05.840 --> 04:08.680]  pins, I would have been not very well medicated.
[04:08.680 --> 04:12.440]  So let's continue with this message because it says, I am in New York.
[04:12.440 --> 04:16.760]  I went to my local courthouse to pick up my pistol permit and had to go through a metal
[04:16.760 --> 04:17.760]  detector.
[04:17.760 --> 04:22.120]  Yes, when you go into most courthouses, you are forced to walk through the metal detectors.
[04:22.120 --> 04:26.800]  This person says I emptied my pockets and completely forgot I had my cartridge pin in
[04:26.800 --> 04:30.520]  my pocket that I got while on vacation in Portland.
[04:30.520 --> 04:32.720]  So this person walked into the court.
[04:32.720 --> 04:36.280]  They thought, sure, I'll throw my car keys and my cell phone and whatever else in the
[04:36.280 --> 04:39.200]  little basket here and I'll walk right through the metal detector.
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.240]  And this dude realizes I have got my cartridge.
[04:42.240 --> 04:45.520]  He picked up a cart when he was in Portland, probably came back.
[04:45.520 --> 04:49.440]  All the travel woes took over, completely forgot that cartridge was there.
[04:49.440 --> 04:51.440]  This dude pulls it out in the courthouse.
[04:51.440 --> 04:57.200]  He says, nearly shit myself as the cop took the bin and I walked through the metal detector.
[04:57.920 --> 05:00.600]  Yeah, I could imagine that feeling being in New York.
[05:00.600 --> 05:04.560]  It is much more secure than a lot of other places I am certain of.
[05:04.560 --> 05:06.600]  It is not cannabis friendly.
[05:06.600 --> 05:09.400]  So here in Colorado, if they catch you with your pin, they go, fucking take that back
[05:09.400 --> 05:10.400]  to the car.
[05:10.400 --> 05:11.400]  You can't bring that in here.
[05:11.400 --> 05:14.200]  I'm sure if they catch you with that in New York, they go, oh, you're already in the court.
[05:14.200 --> 05:15.200]  Let's just put you in a cage.
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.280]  And they just skip a bunch of steps.
[05:17.280 --> 05:22.560]  Anyway, this person says not a word was said and I was on my way.
[05:22.560 --> 05:23.960]  So this person got lucky.
[05:23.960 --> 05:27.640]  Luckily, that law enforcement officer that had to inspect the handful of crap that they
[05:27.640 --> 05:31.160]  passed through, they just thought, oh, that's probably just a nicotine pen and they didn't
[05:31.160 --> 05:32.320]  give a shit.
[05:32.320 --> 05:36.160]  Part of the thing was that you just slid it right through and didn't act like it was anything.
[05:36.160 --> 05:37.760]  So they didn't think it was anything.
[05:37.760 --> 05:38.760]  You wouldn't hand them drugs.
[05:38.760 --> 05:40.440]  You wouldn't be like, here's my drugs.
[05:40.440 --> 05:41.840]  So they thought these aren't drugs.
[05:41.840 --> 05:44.040]  They said, yeah, that's probably your nicotine pen.
[05:44.040 --> 05:45.560]  And they just let it slide right through.
[05:45.560 --> 05:46.560]  So congratulations.
[05:46.560 --> 05:50.480]  I am really happy that you did not get yourself in trouble.
[05:50.480 --> 05:51.920]  Be more careful, bro.
[05:51.920 --> 05:55.760]  Everybody out there, if you are going to any sort of environment where you feel like
[05:55.760 --> 05:58.900]  you may need to empty your pockets, do a double check.
[05:58.900 --> 06:01.880]  Make sure you don't have anything illegal in your pocket so you don't get yourself in
[06:01.880 --> 06:02.880]  trouble.
[06:02.880 --> 06:05.560]  There's a really funny meme that goes around on social media.
[06:05.560 --> 06:09.880]  It shows that a waitress in Colorado went to leave her pen along with the check at the
[06:09.880 --> 06:15.200]  restaurant so the diner could sign their check, but they accidentally left their dab pen.
[06:15.200 --> 06:19.600]  Now, if that were the wrong environment, that person could have gotten in a lot of trouble.
[06:20.280 --> 06:22.400]  Unfortunately, it is a Colorado restaurant.
[06:22.400 --> 06:26.000]  Everybody probably laughed pretty hard at that, but we've got to be more careful.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.720]  I do catch myself getting too relaxed, too comfortable.
[06:29.720 --> 06:33.640]  When I go to other places, I do travel out of state a little bit, and I catch myself
[06:33.640 --> 06:35.640]  just smoking places that I shouldn't be smoking.
[06:35.640 --> 06:38.040]  And I have to say, oh yeah, you're not in Colorado.
[06:38.040 --> 06:39.320]  You got to chill the fuck out.
[06:39.320 --> 06:43.880]  Also, I was talking about hitting my vape pen at a Tom Segura comedy show.
[06:43.880 --> 06:46.000]  I would never smoke in Comedy Works.
[06:46.000 --> 06:48.800]  That was at a different venue, a much larger venue.
[06:49.600 --> 06:53.280]  I had my pen in my hand just because I have it, and I clicked the button a couple of times,
[06:53.280 --> 06:55.520]  and I put it in my mouth, and I just ripped it.
[06:55.520 --> 07:01.000]  And as I had a lung full of dab smoke, I realized, you've got a lung full of dab smoke in a comedy
[07:01.000 --> 07:02.840]  club, and you should not be doing this.
[07:02.840 --> 07:04.520]  I was like, no, what am I going to do?
[07:04.520 --> 07:05.840]  I got a bunch of smoke in my lungs.
[07:05.840 --> 07:08.800]  I had to hold that shit in until I almost died, you guys.
[07:08.800 --> 07:12.280]  So I did catch myself getting a little too comfortable, a little too at home.
[07:12.280 --> 07:15.640]  I just pulled out my pen and ripped it right there in the Belco Theater like I was supposed
[07:15.640 --> 07:17.120]  to be smoking it there.
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.640]  You're not supposed to be smoking it there.
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.960]  They would have kicked me out if somebody had spotted me.
[07:20.960 --> 07:22.880]  So we need to learn to be a little more careful.
[07:22.880 --> 07:25.680]  If you're in a legal state, still be a little bit paranoid.
[07:25.680 --> 07:28.920]  If you were in an illegal state, please be extra paranoid.
[07:28.920 --> 07:30.480]  Let's not get ourselves in trouble.
[07:30.480 --> 07:34.680]  Luckily, our friend walked through and not a word was said because he acted like nothing
[07:34.680 --> 07:35.680]  was wrong.
[07:35.680 --> 07:38.200]  Anyway, there is one more sentence left in this message.
[07:38.200 --> 07:42.920]  It says, anyway, thanks for spreading the knowledge and keep up the amazing work.
[07:42.920 --> 07:46.680]  Hey, our friend King of Prussia, I'm going to call you Wilson if you get that joke.
[07:46.680 --> 07:48.280]  You're a lot cooler than some people.
[07:48.280 --> 07:50.320]  Wilson, thank you for the great email.
[07:50.320 --> 07:51.320]  I do appreciate it.
[07:51.320 --> 07:54.200]  I'm glad you did not get in any trouble.
[07:54.200 --> 08:00.280]  If anybody else out there wants to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:00.280 --> 08:01.600]  I would love to hear from you.
[08:01.600 --> 08:04.720]  All right, let's just keep the show moving right into the next email.
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.520]  This one goes like this.
[08:06.520 --> 08:12.720]  Hefe Jeff, I've got four outdoor container grown Sunkiss plants where the top surface
[08:12.720 --> 08:15.680]  trichomes are about 20% amber.
[08:15.680 --> 08:22.720]  So this person has four Sunkiss plants outdoors in containers and the top surface trichomes
[08:22.720 --> 08:24.120]  are 20% amber.
[08:24.120 --> 08:25.720]  That is a great place to start.
[08:25.720 --> 08:27.400]  That is good information.
[08:27.400 --> 08:29.320]  Sunkiss is across that I bred.
[08:29.320 --> 08:33.400]  That is of course the platinum tangy from our friends at the Garden of Wheaton, across
[08:33.400 --> 08:35.280]  to my Arise.
[08:35.280 --> 08:37.720]  Wonderful strain to work with, a great outdoor strain.
[08:37.720 --> 08:39.000]  We should have good success.
[08:39.000 --> 08:40.000]  Let's continue.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.160]  It says, normally I would think these plants would be ready for harvest, but looking at
[08:44.160 --> 08:49.320]  the undersides of the leaves through a high quality botanical microscope showing trichomes
[08:49.320 --> 08:54.200]  are still clear and cloudy with a little bit of amber coloration.
[08:54.200 --> 08:59.960]  So this person has acquired a scope that probably magnifies somewhere to 60 to 100 X and they're
[08:59.960 --> 09:04.680]  looking at the undersides of the leaves through their microscope and the trichomes are still
[09:04.680 --> 09:07.920]  clear on the undersides of the leaves.
[09:07.920 --> 09:10.200]  More of the message says, I am a beginner grower.
[09:10.200 --> 09:14.800]  This is my third grow and I previously would have cut these plants at this point, but given
[09:14.800 --> 09:21.280]  that they're at day 48 of flower and the suggested harvest age from iRegeneticsColorado.com is
[09:21.280 --> 09:25.900]  56 days, I'm wondering if I should wait another week.
[09:25.900 --> 09:31.120]  These plants have had a lot of TLC and full sunlight all summer long.
[09:31.120 --> 09:32.560]  Maybe they're just ready to go.
[09:32.560 --> 09:36.340]  Then he ends it with, appreciate any feedback you can provide.
[09:36.340 --> 09:37.800]  Thank you from our friend.
[09:38.320 --> 09:41.400]  We're just going to call him Caffeine is what he signed it as here.
[09:41.400 --> 09:44.920]  So let's talk about a couple of things that our buddy Caffeine had to say.
[09:44.920 --> 09:49.640]  And just to make you feel better, I do intend on doing a full episode on the strain SunKiss.
[09:49.640 --> 09:52.000]  I think that's about four or five episodes out.
[09:52.000 --> 09:53.000]  It is in the notebook.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.320]  It is mostly written, so we will get a full episode on that strain.
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.560]  But for now, let's focus on some of the questions in this email.
[10:01.560 --> 10:06.840]  You start off right on track with trichomes are 20% amber and normally I would think these
[10:06.880 --> 10:08.680]  plants are ready for harvest.
[10:08.680 --> 10:13.440]  If you've got 20% amber trichomes, you are absolutely ready for harvest.
[10:13.440 --> 10:17.260]  I almost would have taken that plant down sooner, but you're still going to be all right.
[10:17.260 --> 10:18.800]  We have a nice harvest window here.
[10:18.800 --> 10:21.440]  We'll talk a little bit about that in a moment.
[10:21.440 --> 10:22.440]  I would take those down.
[10:22.440 --> 10:23.480]  They are probably done.
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.280]  You're saying, but looking at the underside of the leaves through a high quality microscope
[10:27.280 --> 10:32.400]  shows clear with little amber coloration in the trichomes.
[10:32.400 --> 10:35.440]  Now the undersides of the leaves don't really matter.
[10:35.440 --> 10:38.320]  What we are going for is ripe trichomes on the buds.
[10:38.320 --> 10:40.560]  How many of those leaves are you going to smoke?
[10:40.560 --> 10:41.880]  Hopefully not too many.
[10:41.880 --> 10:44.540]  Hopefully you're going to turn that into concentrates or something.
[10:44.540 --> 10:45.740]  Hopefully you're not smoking the leaves.
[10:45.740 --> 10:47.880]  We want to focus mostly on the buds.
[10:47.880 --> 10:50.000]  I would look at a bud up at top.
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.440]  I would look at a bud halfway down the plant and then I would look at a lower bud and I
[10:53.440 --> 10:58.040]  would do a few checks with my microscope and I would see what percentage of the trichomes
[10:58.040 --> 11:00.000]  are amber in each section of the plant.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.620]  And then I would use my best judgment to harvest based on the overall appearance of the trichomes.
[11:04.620 --> 11:09.500]  The trichomes you're finding on the undersides of the leaves would have very little to do
[11:09.500 --> 11:12.660]  with my decision making when thinking about harvest times.
[11:12.660 --> 11:14.740]  That would not matter to me at all.
[11:14.740 --> 11:16.300]  I want to look at the buds.
[11:16.300 --> 11:19.980]  So it sounds like you've got 20% amber trichomes on your buds.
[11:19.980 --> 11:22.380]  Your plants are probably ready for harvest.
[11:22.380 --> 11:25.060]  Now you did bring up a very good topic in here.
[11:25.060 --> 11:30.100]  It says I previously would have cut these, but they're at day 48 and on the website from
[11:30.100 --> 11:34.260]  the breeder, which is myself, we recommend 56 days.
[11:34.260 --> 11:36.220]  So you're wondering if you should wait.
[11:36.220 --> 11:38.980]  If the plants are showing you that they're done, they are done.
[11:38.980 --> 11:40.700]  Don't worry about what the website says.
[11:40.700 --> 11:42.060]  Don't worry about what I told you.
[11:42.060 --> 11:44.340]  Don't worry about what I said in a live feed.
[11:44.340 --> 11:46.620]  Don't worry about what anybody on social media tells you.
[11:46.620 --> 11:49.260]  If the trichomes are amber, the plant is done.
[11:49.260 --> 11:53.380]  That is what we use to gauge the ripeness of a plant is amber trichomes.
[11:53.380 --> 11:55.260]  That is our goal, is a ripe trichome.
[11:55.260 --> 11:57.700]  So if that is ripe, the plant is ripe.
[11:57.700 --> 12:00.700]  Nobody on Facebook knows if that trichome is ripe.
[12:00.700 --> 12:02.500]  Nobody on any social media knows.
[12:02.540 --> 12:04.380]  I don't even know if it's ripe.
[12:04.380 --> 12:08.020]  There are variations in plants that come from seed.
[12:08.020 --> 12:14.380]  Ideally most phenotypes of that plant overall will end around the 56 day mark.
[12:14.380 --> 12:15.940]  You've got an anomaly.
[12:15.940 --> 12:17.820]  You may have gotten a little extra sunshine.
[12:17.820 --> 12:21.020]  You may have gotten a little less sunshine than some grows.
[12:21.020 --> 12:22.460]  Maybe you fed it something different.
[12:22.460 --> 12:23.460]  Maybe you fed it more.
[12:23.460 --> 12:24.820]  Maybe you fed it less.
[12:24.820 --> 12:27.060]  Maybe it is just a phenotypical expression.
[12:27.060 --> 12:29.940]  Maybe you got one that finishes around, what day are you at?
[12:29.940 --> 12:30.940]  48?
[12:30.940 --> 12:32.460]  And you finished a week early.
[12:32.460 --> 12:37.860]  That is a really good thing and it is very possible because the sunkiss strain does have
[12:37.860 --> 12:40.820]  phenotypes that end a little bit earlier.
[12:40.820 --> 12:44.900]  But if I would have written on that package or on my website that those plants end at
[12:44.900 --> 12:50.580]  48 days, if those plants took 52 days, the world would have been pissed off at me.
[12:50.580 --> 12:55.220]  So saying that they end at 56 days and you've got one that went a week early, that is kind
[12:55.220 --> 12:56.220]  of a good thing.
[12:56.220 --> 12:59.580]  It still sucks because I gave you poor timing, but that is an anomaly.
[12:59.580 --> 13:03.660]  That is a phenotypical variance, something that is kind of expected when it comes to
[13:03.660 --> 13:04.660]  growing.
[13:04.660 --> 13:05.820]  So we have to pay attention to that.
[13:05.820 --> 13:10.940]  And honestly, I listed 56 days because that is my experience indoors.
[13:10.940 --> 13:14.700]  You've grown this outdoors, so you're finding different results because you've got different
[13:14.700 --> 13:16.300]  conditions.
[13:16.300 --> 13:17.700]  So that is to be expected.
[13:17.700 --> 13:19.440]  Let's talk about that briefly.
[13:19.440 --> 13:23.420]  When we were talking about the time that it should take to flower on a pack of seeds,
[13:23.420 --> 13:25.020]  that is a guess.
[13:25.020 --> 13:26.500]  That is an estimate.
[13:26.500 --> 13:30.820]  Depending on the breeder of those plants, that estimate is based on different things.
[13:30.820 --> 13:34.500]  Unfortunately, we can type whatever we want on our websites.
[13:34.500 --> 13:36.860]  We can type whatever we want on our packaging.
[13:36.860 --> 13:41.460]  And there are very few people that will hold us accountable to that until growers start
[13:41.460 --> 13:44.980]  buying the seeds and discovering that we told a lie.
[13:44.980 --> 13:46.820]  That is the only thing holding us accountable.
[13:46.820 --> 13:49.140]  But by then you've bought the seeds and you've grown them.
[13:49.140 --> 13:51.520]  Somebody's got your money and they're on vacation already.
[13:51.520 --> 13:57.440]  The proper way to do it is to create the seeds, then grow them and take a lot of notes.
[13:57.440 --> 14:02.760]  And that is how I determine how long I suggest those seeds are grown, is by growing out large
[14:02.760 --> 14:03.760]  populations.
[14:03.760 --> 14:07.440]  I like to grow at least 100 seeds before anybody else gets to see them.
[14:07.440 --> 14:08.680]  So I know what to look for.
[14:08.680 --> 14:11.920]  When you grow 100, it is really easy to create percentages.
[14:11.920 --> 14:13.680]  If one does it, it's 1%.
[14:13.680 --> 14:15.820]  If 50 plants do it, that is 50%.
[14:15.820 --> 14:20.960]  It's really easy to identify traits and keep statistics with populations of 100.
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.720]  I grew out 100 of those and the average of those plants were done at day 56.
[14:26.720 --> 14:29.680]  We may have had outliers go a week each direction.
[14:29.680 --> 14:32.200]  I may have had outliers go two weeks either direction.
[14:32.200 --> 14:37.880]  But what I determined overall was that 56 days would be the average completion time
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.160]  for that strain sunkiss, where most people would have the best success.
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.360]  Now we do have to keep in mind that these are plants.
[14:44.360 --> 14:47.300]  There's going to be genetic variation in these seeds.
[14:47.300 --> 14:48.560]  They're seeds made from plants.
[14:48.560 --> 14:51.400]  I'm just taking pollen and putting it on another plant.
[14:51.400 --> 14:53.160]  Nature is making these seeds.
[14:53.160 --> 14:54.160]  The seeds come out.
[14:54.160 --> 14:57.560]  We need to expect some variation.
[14:57.560 --> 14:59.080]  Sunkiss is an F1 hybrid.
[14:59.080 --> 15:00.080]  It is not F2'd.
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.400]  It has not been worked to create more homogenous phenotypes.
[15:04.400 --> 15:07.800]  I like the variation that come from F1 hybrids.
[15:07.800 --> 15:10.880]  I like the vigor that comes from an F1 hybrid.
[15:10.880 --> 15:16.000]  So we need to learn to understand and accept the variation that comes from seeds.
[15:16.000 --> 15:17.000]  I like it.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.560]  I think that growing from seed gives me the option to find something that nobody else
[15:20.560 --> 15:21.880]  will ever have.
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.400]  If the entire neighborhood is sharing clones, everybody is growing the same fucking strain.
[15:27.400 --> 15:32.560]  And in a couple of weeks, everybody is going to be tired of the same fucking strain.
[15:32.560 --> 15:36.720]  So if you buy a pack of seeds and you find two or three different phenotypes, you've
[15:36.720 --> 15:40.600]  already got two or three different things that set you apart from the market, from the
[15:40.600 --> 15:45.640]  other people that are growing that same clone that everybody in the hood is spreading around.
[15:45.640 --> 15:47.720]  So now you are separating yourself from the market.
[15:47.720 --> 15:52.000]  If you are growing for profitability, that is a great way to set yourself apart.
[15:52.000 --> 15:55.360]  Then you select that best phenotype that works the best for you.
[15:55.360 --> 15:59.040]  You've got the one that sells the best, the one that works the best for your growth style,
[15:59.040 --> 16:01.840]  the one that does what needs to be done in your neighborhood.
[16:01.840 --> 16:04.200]  And you can find that by growing from seeds.
[16:04.200 --> 16:07.960]  If you buy seeds and nobody else in the hood bought them, you're the only one with that.
[16:07.960 --> 16:09.400]  Now you get to grow that pack of seeds.
[16:09.400 --> 16:11.240]  You get to find a keeper phenotype.
[16:11.240 --> 16:14.680]  Then you get to dominate the market because you've got something that sets you apart from
[16:14.720 --> 16:15.720]  everybody else.
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.960]  So I really enjoy growing from seed and I really enjoy the variation that I get when
[16:19.960 --> 16:21.960]  it comes to growing from seed.
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.240]  It's kind of like buying a pack of baseball cards, or I guess today you would say Magic
[16:25.240 --> 16:28.200]  the Gathering or fucking Pokemon cards or something like that.
[16:28.200 --> 16:31.840]  You get this pack of cards, you get a pack of seeds and you go home and instead of just
[16:31.840 --> 16:35.600]  opening it up and going through and seeing how many lands and how many rare cards you've
[16:35.600 --> 16:39.240]  got or how many fucking Mickey Mantle cards you've got, you've got to grow the seeds out.
[16:39.240 --> 16:42.320]  You've got 10 seeds, you put them in some water, you put them in some dirt, and then
[16:42.320 --> 16:45.400]  we nurture them for several weeks, a couple of months probably.
[16:45.400 --> 16:49.240]  And then at the end of that, we get to find out what cards came in that package of cards.
[16:49.240 --> 16:51.840]  Did we just get a rare card that's going to help us win the game?
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.200]  Did we just get Mickey Mantle or did we just get a bunch of lands and a bunch of short
[16:55.200 --> 16:56.200]  stops?
[16:56.200 --> 16:57.480]  That is the fun of growing from seed.
[16:57.480 --> 16:59.320]  You get to find out what you get.
[16:59.320 --> 17:01.120]  I really find magic in that.
[17:01.120 --> 17:03.320]  It makes me excited to grow from a pack of seeds.
[17:03.320 --> 17:05.400]  It's like, ooh, I wonder what's in there.
[17:05.400 --> 17:06.560]  And then I am blessed.
[17:06.560 --> 17:08.160]  I've got a lot of seeds.
[17:08.160 --> 17:12.080]  So I get to find many variations, many anomalies.
[17:12.840 --> 17:15.720]  I get to see things from populations that most people will never get to see.
[17:15.720 --> 17:18.000]  So growing from seed really excites me.
[17:18.000 --> 17:19.880]  I really love the variation.
[17:19.880 --> 17:21.920]  So let me try to get myself back on track here.
[17:21.920 --> 17:22.920]  You were correct.
[17:22.920 --> 17:24.160]  Those plants are finished.
[17:24.160 --> 17:29.360]  I would focus on the trichomes on the buds, not as much as the trichomes on the leaves.
[17:29.360 --> 17:31.100]  We aren't too worried about the leaves.
[17:31.100 --> 17:32.480]  Those are kind of bonus trichomes.
[17:32.480 --> 17:33.720]  Those are secondary trichomes.
[17:33.720 --> 17:38.400]  You're probably going to cut those off and throw them away if they are not used for extraction.
[17:38.400 --> 17:40.440]  So focus on those trichomes on the buds.
[17:40.440 --> 17:41.920]  You said they're 20% amber.
[17:41.920 --> 17:44.600]  It is probably time to harvest that plant.
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.000]  I hope you've been flushing because it is time to cut down.
[17:48.000 --> 17:51.720]  Now I hope you took a clone because you've got a phenotype that ends a little bit early
[17:51.720 --> 17:54.240]  and indoors, that plant would be a dream.
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.740]  It is very hard to find a plant that finishes around the 48-day marker.
[17:58.740 --> 18:05.160]  You can increase productivity by one full crop per year indoors if you have that phenotype
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.800]  and it is reliable and it creates a potent product that people want.
[18:10.160 --> 18:14.400]  Most of the time we are running eight or nine week plants, which will give us about 5.7
[18:14.400 --> 18:18.200]  harvests per year if we keep a perpetual cycle going in one room.
[18:18.200 --> 18:24.200]  If you cut off those extra few days, you give us the potential for one extra harvest in
[18:24.200 --> 18:25.200]  our room.
[18:25.200 --> 18:28.120]  Now based on the amount of lights and square footage in that room, that could be as much
[18:28.120 --> 18:34.200]  as one pound per year extra or in some facilities where I work, that could be as much as 250
[18:34.200 --> 18:37.120]  pounds extra product in one year.
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.080]  So I think you're really lucky, really blessed to have found a phenotype of Sunkist that
[18:41.080 --> 18:43.680]  ends at 48, possibly 50 days.
[18:43.680 --> 18:44.680]  I hope it is a winner.
[18:44.680 --> 18:45.680]  I hope it's a keeper.
[18:45.680 --> 18:47.440]  I hope it is highly potent for you.
[18:47.440 --> 18:49.240]  I hope it tastes amazing.
[18:49.240 --> 18:52.320]  Most of all, I really want to see some photos.
[18:52.320 --> 18:56.480]  If you haven't cut it down by the time you hear this, go outside, take a nice photo and
[18:56.480 --> 18:57.480]  send that shit to me.
[18:57.480 --> 19:02.760]  You can send it to me at growfromyourheart.com or you can send it to my breeder email,
[19:02.760 --> 19:03.760]  iregenetics.com.
[19:03.760 --> 19:06.920]  Either way, I would love to see your work.
[19:07.920 --> 19:11.160]  He wraps up the message by saying, appreciate any feedback you can provide.
[19:11.160 --> 19:13.000]  I hope I was able to help you out.
[19:13.000 --> 19:14.040]  Those plants are done.
[19:14.040 --> 19:15.160]  I hope you've got clones.
[19:15.160 --> 19:17.520]  I hope you're able to run that indoors again.
[19:17.520 --> 19:19.360]  I hope it works very well for you.
[19:19.360 --> 19:21.560]  He wraps it up and he calls himself Caffeine.
[19:21.560 --> 19:23.520]  So big shout out to our buddy Caffeine.
[19:23.520 --> 19:26.040]  Thank you for the great email.
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.680]  All right, Podcast World, this is a Thursday episode, so I'm going to cut it short.

[21:09.720 --> 21:13.040]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
