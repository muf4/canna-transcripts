[03:15.780 --> 03:18.780]  We had a little conversation about seeds versus clones.

[03:23.780 --> 03:28.780]  None of us really seem to like auto flower seeds, but we did talk about one very useful application.
[03:28.780 --> 03:31.780]  So we'll go ahead and get right to that.
[03:31.780 --> 03:33.780]  We did get a little dabbed out.

[04:01.780 --> 04:07.780]  So without any further ado, let's go get to the conversation with Jesse, Spence and myself.
[04:07.780 --> 04:08.780]  Check it out.
[04:29.650 --> 04:31.650]  Hi, what's up, ladies and gentlemen? We are back.
[04:31.650 --> 04:32.650]  I've got my homie Jesse.
[04:32.650 --> 04:33.650]  What's up?
[04:33.650 --> 04:35.650]  At jessegrows on Instagram and Twitter.
[04:35.650 --> 04:38.650]  And also we got, is it at jessegrows on Twitter? I looked for you, bro.
[04:38.650 --> 04:40.650]  There's another person called jessegrows on Twitter.
[04:40.650 --> 04:41.650]  Oh, fuck that guy.
[04:42.650 --> 04:43.650]  How the hell is that even?
[04:43.650 --> 04:44.650]  Politely fuck that guy.
[04:44.650 --> 04:45.650]  Yeah, I don't even know him.
[04:45.650 --> 04:46.650]  Yeah, actually I don't know him.
[04:46.650 --> 04:48.650]  It could be cool as shit.
[04:48.650 --> 04:52.650]  It could be like your German clone or something.
[04:52.650 --> 04:53.650]  Be just like you in Germany.
[04:53.650 --> 04:55.650]  It's jessegrows.
[04:57.650 --> 04:59.650]  Also with us over here on the microphone is our buddy Spence.
[04:59.650 --> 05:00.650]  What up, Spence?
[05:00.650 --> 05:01.650]  What up, guys?
[05:01.650 --> 05:05.650]  Spence has got his microphone strategically placed so that he can iPhone it up on the table.
[05:05.650 --> 05:06.650]  And talk.
[05:06.650 --> 05:07.650]  And talk at the same time.
[05:07.650 --> 05:08.650]  He's got the elbows out.
[05:08.650 --> 05:09.650]  He's chilling it up.
[05:09.650 --> 05:10.650]  We have had some fat dabs today.
[05:11.650 --> 05:12.650]  What did you give me a dab of a minute ago?
[05:12.650 --> 05:13.650]  That live resin.
[05:13.650 --> 05:14.650]  What was that?
[05:14.650 --> 05:15.650]  It's Yeti OG.
[05:15.650 --> 05:16.650]  Oh, yeah.
[05:16.650 --> 05:17.650]  Okay.
[05:17.650 --> 05:18.650]  That's why I loved it.
[05:18.650 --> 05:20.650]  We've been smoking on that Yeti OG around here for a couple of weeks.
[05:20.650 --> 05:23.650]  Big ups to the people making the live resin happen.
[05:23.650 --> 05:24.650]  We appreciate it.
[05:24.650 --> 05:25.650]  There's a whole chain of people that make that happen.
[05:25.650 --> 05:26.650]  It's not one or two people.
[05:26.650 --> 05:27.650]  It's a big fucking chain of command.
[05:27.650 --> 05:29.650]  And I appreciate that shit.
[05:29.650 --> 05:30.650]  Very much so.
[05:30.650 --> 05:31.650]  Thank you.
[05:31.650 --> 05:32.650]  How are you guys doing today, man?
[05:32.650 --> 05:33.650]  Chilling.
[05:33.650 --> 05:36.650]  Excited to be here for another podcast, you know.
[05:36.650 --> 05:37.650]  You told me what you did today.
[05:37.650 --> 05:38.650]  I think it's fucking funny.
[05:38.650 --> 05:39.650]  We won't talk about that on the show.
[05:39.650 --> 05:40.650]  That's hilarious shit.
[05:40.650 --> 05:43.650]  Man is getting his hustle on in ways you never thought of.
[05:43.650 --> 05:46.650]  Jesse dug fucking fence post holes all day.
[05:46.650 --> 05:47.650]  So he's lively.
[05:47.650 --> 05:48.650]  He's over here hyper.
[05:48.650 --> 05:49.650]  Not at all.
[05:49.650 --> 05:50.650]  He just took a fat dab.
[05:50.650 --> 05:53.650]  I think we all took fat dabs over here.
[05:53.650 --> 05:54.650]  Okay.
[05:54.650 --> 05:55.650]  Maybe all of us.
[05:55.650 --> 05:56.650]  Well, yeah.
[05:56.650 --> 05:57.650]  Jesse did just take...
[05:57.650 --> 05:59.650]  That was the largest dab I've ever seen Jesse voluntarily take on his own.
[05:59.650 --> 06:02.650]  I've seen people give him a dab that big, but I've never seen him dip in for that.
[06:02.650 --> 06:05.650]  I've been practicing the last few weeks.
[06:05.650 --> 06:06.650]  Put some music up for you guys.
[06:06.650 --> 06:07.650]  Sorry.
[06:07.650 --> 06:08.650]  Turned it down way solo.
[06:08.650 --> 06:09.650]  We couldn't hear it.
[06:09.650 --> 06:10.650]  Nice.
[06:10.650 --> 06:13.650]  Well, we're here together and talk about the subject at hand, which today I decided we
[06:13.650 --> 06:16.650]  want to talk about clones versus seeds.
[06:16.650 --> 06:19.650]  And maybe we'll do a little bit of talking about feminized seeds.
[06:19.650 --> 06:23.650]  And we might talk a little bit briefly, briefly about auto flowers.
[06:23.650 --> 06:25.650]  I got one thing I wanted to mention in there.
[06:25.650 --> 06:27.650]  This mix that I'm playing really has a lot of volume jumps in the background.
[06:27.650 --> 06:29.650]  So I apologize that it's so jumpy.
[06:29.650 --> 06:31.650]  You're listening to DJ Nickatty in the background again.
[06:31.650 --> 06:32.650]  I got to give him a shout out.
[06:32.650 --> 06:33.650]  Shout out DJ Nickatty.
[06:33.650 --> 06:34.650]  Thanks for letting me play your music.
[06:34.650 --> 06:35.650]  That's awesome.
[06:35.650 --> 06:38.650]  So everybody at this table is a pretty damn experienced grower.
[06:38.650 --> 06:40.650]  We got, I'd call myself a breeder.
[06:40.650 --> 06:42.650]  Jesse's a pollen chucker, maybe a breeder.
[06:42.650 --> 06:44.650]  I don't know if he'd call himself a breeder yet.
[06:44.650 --> 06:45.650]  More practice.
[06:45.650 --> 06:47.650]  Spence is a hell of a grower.
[06:47.650 --> 06:51.650]  We had some stuff tested and Spence has tested higher than all of my stuff.
[06:51.650 --> 06:52.650]  And he grew somebody else's strain.
[06:52.650 --> 06:54.650]  Do you remember what the numbers were, bro?
[06:54.650 --> 06:59.650]  Capleton was 20%.
[07:00.650 --> 07:06.650]  There was a Girl Scout cookie cross, which was creepy OG in Girl Scout.
[07:06.650 --> 07:10.650]  It was 25, maybe 24, probably 24.
[07:10.650 --> 07:14.650]  Ryan's Rhino, 100% Sativa, 25%.
[07:14.650 --> 07:20.650]  And then Forum Girl Scout cookies tested at right around 27.
[07:20.650 --> 07:21.650]  So this guy crushed it.
[07:21.650 --> 07:22.650]  He had some great, great tests.
[07:22.650 --> 07:26.650]  My Veganic Lemon Jeffrey tested right around 24%, if that gives you some.
[07:27.650 --> 07:29.650]  Which, by the way, that was awesome.
[07:29.650 --> 07:32.650]  It was some of the best veganic wheat I've probably ever smoked.
[07:32.650 --> 07:33.650]  Well, thank you.
[07:33.650 --> 07:35.650]  How much of veganic wheat have you smoked?
[07:35.650 --> 07:36.650]  Do you know?
[07:36.650 --> 07:37.650]  I've smoked some.
[07:37.650 --> 07:41.650]  I've smoked some from, there's a place in the Springs, I think it's Natural Mystics, they sell it.
[07:41.650 --> 07:43.650]  That's really the only really place.
[07:43.650 --> 07:47.650]  And then I tried some of Buds and Roses at the Cubs.
[07:47.650 --> 07:49.650]  Kyle Cushman's Veganics.
[07:49.650 --> 07:51.650]  So mine stood up to Kyle Cushman's.
[07:51.650 --> 07:52.650]  Definitely.
[07:52.650 --> 07:53.650]  That's a hell of a compliment right there.
[07:53.650 --> 07:57.650]  It's definitely, you have a thing for Sativas.
[07:57.650 --> 08:03.650]  Not a lot of people like Sativas, but I like the citrusy, really high highs.
[08:03.650 --> 08:08.650]  I think putting a plank, take more time to grow like a Sativa does, it lets you get more out of it.
[08:08.650 --> 08:11.650]  It's nothing but the longer the better, in my opinion.
[08:11.650 --> 08:12.650]  For sure.
[08:12.650 --> 08:13.650]  Depending on your technique, you know what I'm saying?
[08:13.650 --> 08:14.650]  Yeah.
[08:14.650 --> 08:16.650]  Guys, quit cutting your plants down too early.
[08:16.650 --> 08:17.650]  All right.
[08:17.650 --> 08:22.650]  So, yeah, that was just, and Jesse, to give him some credit in the game, he won the Pueblo Super Bud Bowl,
[08:22.650 --> 08:24.650]  and they gave him hella huge compliments.
[08:24.650 --> 08:26.650]  If you guys listened to past episodes, we talked about that.
[08:26.650 --> 08:33.650]  The judges of the Super Bud Bowl said that Jesse's strains stood out in flavor, aroma, taste, and effect.
[08:33.650 --> 08:37.650]  Overall, without a doubt, he was the hands-down winner, the freaking champ, right?
[08:37.650 --> 08:38.650]  Yes.
[08:38.650 --> 08:39.650]  Grape OG.
[08:39.650 --> 08:40.650]  Something like that, yes.
[08:40.650 --> 08:41.650]  Grape OG.
[08:41.650 --> 08:42.650]  It's a hell of a strain, too.
[08:42.650 --> 08:43.650]  I took some cuts of it today.
[08:43.650 --> 08:44.650]  Awesome.
[08:44.650 --> 08:45.650]  We'll see what happens.
[08:45.650 --> 08:46.650]  Awesome.
[08:46.650 --> 08:47.650]  So these guys are, we're all experienced growers here.
[08:47.650 --> 08:49.650]  I'm, of course, the breeder from iRegenetics, so I know what I'm doing.
[08:49.650 --> 08:51.650]  We're going to talk a little bit about clones and seeds.
[08:51.650 --> 08:55.650]  Do you have a preference, Jesse, from growing from clone or seed?
[08:57.650 --> 09:02.650]  It has more to do with the end mission, I guess, of whatever particular round.
[09:05.650 --> 09:10.650]  I'd grow from seed if that was all I could do from now on.
[09:10.650 --> 09:11.650]  Okay.
[09:11.650 --> 09:14.650]  So if you were going to set up, I guess a better question would be, if you were going to set up a giant warehouse,
[09:14.650 --> 09:19.650]  not a giant, what if I give you 20 lights, and I was 20 flowering lights, and it's all yours,
[09:19.650 --> 09:22.650]  you're going to start brand new, would you grow from clones or seeds at that point?
[09:24.650 --> 09:25.650]  I'd probably go with clones.
[09:25.650 --> 09:26.650]  Okay.
[09:26.650 --> 09:27.650]  Cool.
[09:27.650 --> 09:28.650]  All right.
[09:28.650 --> 09:29.650]  How about you, Spence, if you had 20 lights to play with?
[09:31.650 --> 09:37.650]  If I had it to play with, I'd probably take two lights and maybe do some seeds, but there's just,
[09:37.650 --> 09:42.650]  when you're that scale, you want something that's proven to give you what you want.
[09:42.650 --> 09:44.650]  That's a perfect segue into what I was going to say.
[09:44.650 --> 09:49.650]  Clones, the pros of clones are that you know you've got females, those have been ran and tested.
[09:49.650 --> 09:52.650]  So if you've got a clone, I'll talk a little bit about a clone and give some setup for what they are,
[09:52.650 --> 09:53.650]  because people are new listeners.
[09:53.650 --> 10:00.650]  A clone is a cutting taken from a plant, a mother plant, that you hopefully have ran before and flowered out,
[10:00.650 --> 10:01.650]  and you know that that's some good shit.
[10:01.650 --> 10:02.650]  Or someone else has.
[10:02.650 --> 10:03.650]  Or someone else has.
[10:03.650 --> 10:09.650]  When you're trusted bros like Spence or Jesse at the table, if they give me a clone, I definitely appreciate it and trust it.
[10:09.650 --> 10:11.650]  I don't usually get dispensary clones and stuff.
[10:11.650 --> 10:13.650]  They're mediocre most of the time.
[10:13.650 --> 10:14.650]  So you've got to know who you're getting it from.
[10:14.650 --> 10:16.650]  But usually it's a reliable crop.
[10:16.650 --> 10:17.650]  It's a female.
[10:17.650 --> 10:19.650]  You're familiar with it.
[10:19.650 --> 10:20.650]  Somebody in the crew has grown it.
[10:20.650 --> 10:23.650]  We can say that takes eight weeks, that takes nine weeks, that takes ten weeks.
[10:23.650 --> 10:27.650]  Or be careful because that fucker might herm if you over-nitrogen it.
[10:27.650 --> 10:29.650]  There's things we know.
[10:29.650 --> 10:32.650]  So that's one of the super, super pros of a clone.
[10:32.650 --> 10:33.650]  We know the growth patterns.
[10:33.650 --> 10:35.650]  We know if we need to top it.
[10:35.650 --> 10:36.650]  We know if we need to train it a little bit.
[10:36.650 --> 10:37.650]  We know how tall it's going to get.
[10:37.650 --> 10:41.650]  I know that the Sauer Diesel cut I've got, if you let it grow more than two feet tall in veg,
[10:42.650 --> 10:44.650]  it's going to be eight feet tall in flour.
[10:44.650 --> 10:46.650]  And I know that from, we've grown it several times.
[10:46.650 --> 10:48.650]  I think I grew that one time.
[10:48.650 --> 10:49.650]  And I learned.
[10:49.650 --> 10:51.650]  Yeah, you learned quick on that shit.
[10:51.650 --> 10:53.650]  It's tickling your lights.
[10:53.650 --> 10:55.650]  And then you know to feed it also.
[10:55.650 --> 10:56.650]  Because you know how long it's going to take.
[10:56.650 --> 10:57.650]  You know when to begin flushing.
[10:57.650 --> 10:59.650]  You know when it's going to be done.
[10:59.650 --> 11:01.650]  The cons of clones.
[11:01.650 --> 11:03.650]  This is why I was asking about the giant warehouse.
[11:03.650 --> 11:07.650]  Clones are where you get most of your damn bugs, I think.
[11:08.650 --> 11:11.650]  When one of your buddies tries to give you a sweet cut of Sauer Diesel.
[11:11.650 --> 11:13.650]  And you get it to your garden.
[11:13.650 --> 11:14.650]  And you're irresponsible.
[11:14.650 --> 11:17.650]  And it's partly your responsibility to quarantine and treat that thing.
[11:17.650 --> 11:21.650]  But sometimes you fail yourself.
[11:21.650 --> 11:22.650]  Just like that guy did.
[11:22.650 --> 11:25.650]  And you end up with spider mites.
[11:25.650 --> 11:28.650]  The feared hemp russet mite in your weed garden right now.
[11:28.650 --> 11:30.650]  Those things will take down your entire crop in two days.
[11:30.650 --> 11:33.650]  I had a friend tell me he had those.
[11:33.650 --> 11:34.650]  He's like, you want to see them?
[11:34.650 --> 11:35.650]  Nope.
[11:35.650 --> 11:37.650]  I don't even want to see you anymore.
[11:37.650 --> 11:39.650]  If you ever get those, just start over.
[11:39.650 --> 11:41.650]  Yeah, fire is the cure.
[11:41.650 --> 11:43.650]  I actually have something I'm experimenting with.
[11:43.650 --> 11:44.650]  A product.
[11:44.650 --> 11:46.650]  I don't know if I've mentioned it on the show.
[11:46.650 --> 11:48.650]  Because I don't want to say anything until I'm familiar with it.
[11:48.650 --> 11:50.650]  It seems to kill everything.
[11:50.650 --> 11:53.650]  Unfortunately, if you do it wrong, it will kill everything.
[11:53.650 --> 11:55.650]  I've volunteered a few plants.
[11:55.650 --> 11:57.650]  And I did a few different applications.
[11:57.650 --> 11:59.650]  And a couple of them just fucking cooked them.
[11:59.650 --> 12:02.650]  But if I learn to do it right, I feel like it will work well.
[12:02.650 --> 12:03.650]  So I'm going to learn it.
[12:03.650 --> 12:05.650]  That's going to make you hard to hear.
[12:05.650 --> 12:07.650]  Jesse is afraid of the microphone.
[12:07.650 --> 12:10.650]  That's awesome.
[12:10.650 --> 12:12.650]  Right there we could hear you all day just like that.
[12:12.650 --> 12:14.650]  I keep worrying about that.
[12:14.650 --> 12:17.650]  If you guys are wondering what that furry sound is, it's music in the background.
[12:17.650 --> 12:19.650]  It's not Jesse's beard rubbing on the microphone.
[12:19.650 --> 12:23.650]  So we get our bugs, our problems, our diseases, our pathogens.
[12:23.650 --> 12:25.650]  Powdery mildew comes from clones.
[12:25.650 --> 12:27.650]  Seeds do not carry bugs.
[12:27.650 --> 12:28.650]  They do not carry diseases.
[12:28.650 --> 12:30.650]  They do not carry pathogens.
[12:30.650 --> 12:32.650]  Something about a clone.
[12:32.650 --> 12:35.650]  If I grow a pack of seeds and I pick the keeper out of that.
[12:35.650 --> 12:38.650]  So you grow ten seeds, there will be different phenotypes in there.
[12:38.650 --> 12:40.650]  Hopefully you find that one that's stellar.
[12:40.650 --> 12:44.650]  Maybe my opinion of that stellar plant is way different than Spence's opinion.
[12:44.650 --> 12:46.650]  Or way different than Jesse's opinion.
[12:46.650 --> 12:47.650]  Or the other guy growing.
[12:47.650 --> 12:50.650]  So I like the ability to pick my own.
[12:50.650 --> 12:52.650]  Which is a benefit of the seed.
[12:52.650 --> 12:54.650]  And a con of the clone.
[12:54.650 --> 12:59.650]  And maybe my grow style or what I'm looking for is way different than what you guys are looking for.
[12:59.650 --> 13:01.650]  Yeah.
[13:01.650 --> 13:04.650]  When you get a ten pack of seeds, how many keepers do you hope to find out of those?
[13:04.650 --> 13:07.650]  Do you hope for that just one or are you looking for all ten of them?
[13:07.650 --> 13:11.650]  I usually, I just look for differences throughout.
[13:11.650 --> 13:17.650]  Because some of them, depending on what kind of seeds you're popping, you'll find differences and whatnot.
[13:17.650 --> 13:19.650]  So I usually try to keep three.
[13:19.650 --> 13:24.650]  Just so I have a, you know, if I have three plants that don't all look the same.
[13:24.650 --> 13:30.650]  Maybe, you know, I just want a better chance of finding something that's better than one or the other.
[13:30.650 --> 13:32.650]  It's good that you say three in my opinion.
[13:32.650 --> 13:37.650]  Because usually I find the one that looks like, if you're crossing a male and a female plant, I like to find the male.
[13:37.650 --> 13:38.650]  Like the one that looks like the male.
[13:38.650 --> 13:39.650]  The one that looks like the female.
[13:39.650 --> 13:41.650]  And then that one that's a hybrid of the two.
[13:41.650 --> 13:43.650]  Yeah, that's usually a good way to do it.
[13:43.650 --> 13:45.650]  And then smoke all those.
[13:45.650 --> 13:46.650]  Get them tested.
[13:46.650 --> 13:47.650]  Do what you can.
[13:47.650 --> 13:48.650]  Have the crew smoke them.
[13:48.650 --> 13:49.650]  Make shatter out of them.
[13:49.650 --> 13:50.650]  Make live resin out of them.
[13:50.650 --> 13:52.650]  See what happens with all that stuff.
[13:52.650 --> 13:53.650]  Cure them a long time.
[13:53.650 --> 13:54.650]  Cure them a long time.
[13:54.650 --> 13:56.650]  That's something I failed at when I was a new grower.
[13:56.650 --> 13:59.650]  I would take that stuff and as soon as it was dry enough to start smoking it.
[14:00.650 --> 14:01.650]  See which was my favorite.
[14:01.650 --> 14:03.650]  I'm sure I got rid of a few keepers.
[14:03.650 --> 14:05.650]  That I just didn't even know yet.
[14:05.650 --> 14:06.650]  Man, yeah.
[14:06.650 --> 14:07.650]  Yeah.
[14:07.650 --> 14:09.650]  So I guess that leads us into seeds a little bit.
[14:09.650 --> 14:12.650]  When you buy a ten pack of seeds, I really like that variation.
[14:12.650 --> 14:14.650]  So you buy a ten pack, you pop them.
[14:14.650 --> 14:17.650]  Sometimes there's fucking seven males in there.
[14:17.650 --> 14:18.650]  Oh God.
[14:18.650 --> 14:20.650]  Yeah, but that's nature.
[14:20.650 --> 14:21.650]  It happens.
[14:21.650 --> 14:22.650]  It does happen.
[14:22.650 --> 14:23.650]  It's a numbers game.
[14:23.650 --> 14:24.650]  It's like bingo.
[14:24.650 --> 14:25.650]  It is like bingo.
[14:25.650 --> 14:27.650]  So hopefully you get that one good one.
[14:27.650 --> 14:31.650]  So hopefully you get five males, five females is usually what I hope for.
[14:31.650 --> 14:32.650]  Somewhere in that area.
[14:32.650 --> 14:35.650]  You hope to get one that you can spot right away that you're like,
[14:35.650 --> 14:37.650]  eh, we got to cull that bitch.
[14:37.650 --> 14:38.650]  And then you got those four to work with.
[14:38.650 --> 14:40.650]  And like Spence said, you get three.
[14:40.650 --> 14:42.650]  So that's where you find new stuff.
[14:42.650 --> 14:44.650]  That's one of the pros of growing from seed.
[14:44.650 --> 14:46.650]  You find all that new stuff.
[14:46.650 --> 14:48.650]  And here's something I thought about earlier.
[14:48.650 --> 14:51.650]  Everything we're growing came from seed in the first place.
[14:51.650 --> 14:52.650]  Eventually.
[14:52.650 --> 14:54.650]  Down the road it came from a seed.
[14:54.650 --> 14:55.650]  The way it's supposed to be.
[14:55.650 --> 14:56.650]  Yeah.
[14:56.650 --> 14:58.650]  We couldn't have a plant without the seed.
[14:58.650 --> 15:00.650]  Nobody took a clone of OG Kush.
[15:00.650 --> 15:01.650]  Yeah.
[15:01.650 --> 15:09.650]  If everyone keeps growing from clone, there are very bad consequences to that.
[15:09.650 --> 15:11.650]  What could happen?
[15:11.650 --> 15:17.650]  Big major companies could maintain control of it, of the seed stock,
[15:17.650 --> 15:24.650]  similar to some ornamental flowers that I can't quote species of or anything like that.
[15:24.650 --> 15:27.650]  I know it's really hard to find genuine seed of some flowers.
[15:27.650 --> 15:28.650]  Yeah.
[15:28.650 --> 15:31.650]  And a lot of the vegetables you can only find specific seeds.
[15:31.650 --> 15:32.650]  For sure.
[15:32.650 --> 15:33.650]  Damn.
[15:33.650 --> 15:34.650]  See, there you go.
[15:34.650 --> 15:36.650]  More beneficial to grow from seed.
[15:36.650 --> 15:37.650]  Or a benefit of growing from seed.
[15:37.650 --> 15:39.650]  Or they'll just start selling only feminized seed.
[15:39.650 --> 15:42.650]  There won't be a gene pool no more.
[15:42.650 --> 15:45.650]  And that's something as a breeder I try to pay attention to.
[15:45.650 --> 15:47.650]  I try to make, and you guys have probably noticed,
[15:47.650 --> 15:49.650]  I've been pulling out a lot more reg seeds lately.
[15:49.650 --> 15:50.650]  Yeah, for sure.
[15:50.650 --> 15:53.650]  We got to have reg seeds because you got to have the males to keep the breeding alive.
[15:53.650 --> 15:55.650]  Or it's going to get stale.
[15:55.650 --> 15:57.650]  F1 hybrids are where it's at.
[15:57.650 --> 15:59.650]  And guys, if you're breeding, please throw away the bullshit.
[15:59.650 --> 16:02.650]  There's going to be some stuff that comes out of your breeding projects
[16:02.650 --> 16:04.650]  that is not worth rebreeding or giving out those seeds.
[16:04.650 --> 16:07.650]  Just toss those because you're polluting the gene pool, you're making it weak,
[16:07.650 --> 16:10.650]  you're making a bunch of runts and mutants, and you're fucking it up.
[16:10.650 --> 16:13.650]  Just get rid of all that non-elite stuff.
[16:13.650 --> 16:15.650]  Yeah, all the poser stuff and just kill it, dude.
[16:15.650 --> 16:16.650]  Just kill it.
[16:16.650 --> 16:17.650]  We can breed more seeds.
[16:17.650 --> 16:18.650]  There's more coming.
[16:18.650 --> 16:21.650]  I definitely give props to the people who actually try their own seeds.
[16:22.650 --> 16:24.650]  If you produce some seeds, actually grow it.
[16:24.650 --> 16:28.650]  See what it is before you give it to people, etc.
[16:28.650 --> 16:30.650]  Give a bunch of it away, also.
[16:30.650 --> 16:32.650]  Give them away so that other people can see.
[16:32.650 --> 16:35.650]  You can see what Nancy Budwell, shout out to Nancy Budwell, what she does.
[16:35.650 --> 16:36.650]  Shout out to Nancy.
[16:36.650 --> 16:40.650]  Man, that lady grows some fun cannabis under LEDs.
[16:40.650 --> 16:44.650]  I'm not even a big fan of LEDs, and she is killing it with that shit, bro.
[16:44.650 --> 16:45.650]  Yeah.
[16:45.650 --> 16:47.650]  Yeah, I'm actually like that you say that.
[16:47.650 --> 16:49.650]  You keep saying good shit to make more good shit to talk about.
[16:49.650 --> 16:51.650]  I'm growing the night nurse right now.
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.650]  She looks stellar.
[16:52.650 --> 16:56.650]  There's one that looks really Grateful Dog dominant but smells like Tora Bora.
[16:56.650 --> 16:58.650]  Maybe it'll pass those CBDs.
[16:58.650 --> 16:59.650]  Right, I hope so.
[16:59.650 --> 17:00.650]  I hope so.
[17:00.650 --> 17:02.650]  We need some good CBD medicine.
[17:02.650 --> 17:04.650]  With the seeds, you get new stuff like we were talking about.
[17:04.650 --> 17:07.650]  You get to do that phenotype hunt.
[17:07.650 --> 17:10.650]  That's essentially when you pop a pack of seeds.
[17:10.650 --> 17:12.650]  They call it mapping or searching or hunting.
[17:12.650 --> 17:14.650]  Subcool calls it something different.
[17:14.650 --> 17:17.650]  I forgot what he even calls it, but it's a pheno hunt in this group is what we call it.
[17:17.650 --> 17:19.650]  You run as many seeds as you can get of one strain.
[17:19.650 --> 17:21.650]  If you can do 20 of them, do 20.
[17:21.650 --> 17:22.650]  That's awesome.
[17:22.650 --> 17:24.650]  25 of something is cool.
[17:24.650 --> 17:27.650]  If you've only got a 10 or a 6-pack or a 5-pack, that works too.
[17:27.650 --> 17:28.650]  Just work on your scale.
[17:28.650 --> 17:32.650]  But the more, the better because that gives you, you can see what that strain's potential is,
[17:32.650 --> 17:36.650]  and you know what you're looking for a little better, and you can get that one.
[17:36.650 --> 17:39.650]  Like I know what I want out of a Grateful Dog pack of beans.
[17:39.650 --> 17:43.650]  You may want something totally different out of a pack of dog beans.
[17:43.650 --> 17:45.650]  And we'll find it by doing that pheno hunt.
[17:45.650 --> 17:48.650]  That's fun to me, running that hunt, seeing the variations.
[17:48.650 --> 17:51.650]  And as a breeder, I love seeing the variations from my creations.
[17:51.650 --> 17:53.650]  That's a lot of fun.
[17:53.650 --> 17:57.650]  If we're growing clones, we're all growing the same shit.
[17:57.650 --> 18:00.650]  There's a blue dream cut going around this town right now, going around Colorado.
[18:00.650 --> 18:02.650]  I don't think it's just this town.
[18:02.650 --> 18:04.650]  I think it is just Colorado in general.
[18:04.650 --> 18:09.650]  Every time I see somebody post a picture of Blue Dream, it's like, dear God, there it is again.
[18:09.650 --> 18:10.650]  It's the same Blue Dream.
[18:10.650 --> 18:12.650]  The thing harvests heavy.
[18:12.650 --> 18:13.650]  Oh, yeah. I love it.
[18:13.650 --> 18:19.650]  It'll grow in any type of conditions, and she'll give you some product back if you're good to her.
[18:19.650 --> 18:20.650]  Oh, yeah.
[18:20.650 --> 18:25.650]  I can pull six ounces out of a seven-gallon pot with four of them per light, so that's a pound and a half of herb.
[18:25.650 --> 18:27.650]  Yeah.
[18:27.650 --> 18:28.650]  I let her go about 70 days.
[18:28.650 --> 18:29.650]  Thanks, Andy.
[18:29.650 --> 18:30.650]  She packs it on.
[18:30.650 --> 18:31.650]  Is that Andy's Blue Dream cut?
[18:31.650 --> 18:32.650]  Yeah. Shout out to Andy.
[18:32.650 --> 18:33.650]  What?
[18:33.650 --> 18:34.650]  Shout out.
[18:34.650 --> 18:35.650]  What's up, ABD?
[18:35.650 --> 18:36.650]  Yeah. Come get your stuff back.
[18:36.650 --> 18:40.650]  We're cool. We're done.
[18:40.650 --> 18:41.650]  We love it so much we hate it.
[18:42.650 --> 18:44.650]  It's so good that it's just terrible.
[18:44.650 --> 18:47.650]  No, we love the Andy's Blue Dream. I didn't mean to call it terrible.
[18:47.650 --> 18:49.650]  How about the cons of growing from seed?
[18:49.650 --> 18:51.650]  Some people are not good at spotting males.
[18:51.650 --> 18:53.650]  That's the main problem.
[18:53.650 --> 18:54.650]  Yeah.
[18:54.650 --> 19:00.650]  I mean, if you're a beginner grower, sometimes you don't even know.
[19:00.650 --> 19:04.650]  I know people that have seen male plants, and is there ever going to be flowers from there?
[19:04.650 --> 19:05.650]  It's like, no.
[19:05.650 --> 19:08.650]  These are two completely different things.
[19:08.650 --> 19:10.650]  I just think it's about paying attention.
[19:10.650 --> 19:13.650]  If you pay attention, you've got to see.
[19:13.650 --> 19:14.650]  Read a book.
[19:14.650 --> 19:15.650]  Read a book.
[19:15.650 --> 19:18.650]  Every grow book has a picture of a male and a female right next to each other.
[19:18.650 --> 19:19.650]  Yep.
[19:19.650 --> 19:20.650]  Spot your males.
[19:20.650 --> 19:21.650]  What about mutants?
[19:21.650 --> 19:23.650]  Sometimes you get that crazy mutant shit.
[19:23.650 --> 19:24.650]  They're fun.
[19:24.650 --> 19:25.650]  They're funky.
[19:25.650 --> 19:27.650]  I think Chemdog is a mutant.
[19:27.650 --> 19:29.650]  The person or the nut?
[19:31.650 --> 19:32.650]  Both.
[19:32.650 --> 19:34.650]  Shout out to Chemdog.
[19:34.650 --> 19:36.650]  And if you're writing Chemdog, it's C-H-E-M-D-O-G.
[19:36.650 --> 19:37.650]  Yeah, D-O-G.
[19:37.650 --> 19:39.650]  He corrected us. It's D-O-G.
[19:39.650 --> 19:40.650]  Shout out Chemdog.
[19:40.650 --> 19:42.650]  I used to have a dog named that.
[19:42.650 --> 19:43.650]  That's pretty awesome.
[19:43.650 --> 19:44.650]  No, D-O-G.
[19:44.650 --> 19:46.650]  D-O-G. My buddy Ryan had a dog named D-O-G.
[19:46.650 --> 19:48.650]  He was a cool ass dog.
[19:48.650 --> 19:50.650]  Cool dog. What's up, guys? I miss you. I haven't seen you guys in a long time.
[19:50.650 --> 19:52.650]  You don't listen to the show, but still thinking about you.
[19:54.650 --> 19:55.650]  Selection time.
[19:55.650 --> 19:58.650]  When you're growing from seeds, there's always that pheno hunt.
[19:58.650 --> 20:01.650]  When you're growing from clones, that first crop you're going to grow, that's Blue Dream.
[20:01.650 --> 20:03.650]  You're cool. You've got all the Blue Dream you can handle.
[20:03.650 --> 20:07.650]  When you're running from seed, you've got to run a crop to find what you're even messing with.
[20:07.650 --> 20:11.650]  And then run a crop to keep again of the ones you like.
[20:11.650 --> 20:12.650]  Right.
[20:12.650 --> 20:15.650]  And then if you need to eliminate more, then you're going to run it again.
[20:15.650 --> 20:17.650]  Again and again and narrow it down.
[20:17.650 --> 20:18.650]  Yep.
[20:18.650 --> 20:20.650]  So, and hopefully you take clones.
[20:20.650 --> 20:23.650]  Like I said on another episode, take clones of everything you ever grow.
[20:23.650 --> 20:25.650]  Before it's in flower.
[20:25.650 --> 20:26.650]  Right, before you fly.
[20:26.650 --> 20:28.650]  Like, yeah, 15 days before you put it in flower, take some clones.
[20:28.650 --> 20:30.650]  That way you know those clones are going to root.
[20:30.650 --> 20:32.650]  And if you don't have clones, you can try again.
[20:32.650 --> 20:34.650]  Like, give yourself a chance.
[20:34.650 --> 20:36.650]  Plan ahead. Plan ahead when you're growing.
[20:36.650 --> 20:38.650]  It's always beneficial.
[20:38.650 --> 20:40.650]  Give yourself the advantage.
[20:40.650 --> 20:41.650]  Yeah.
[20:41.650 --> 20:43.650]  The advantage. The heads up for yourself.
[20:43.650 --> 20:44.650]  Don't put yourself behind.
[20:44.650 --> 20:46.650]  Because once you're behind in growing, you're behind in growing.
[20:46.650 --> 20:48.650]  And that probably means your plants are stressed out.
[20:48.650 --> 20:50.650]  Yeah, if you're stressed, they are.
[20:50.650 --> 20:52.650]  You ain't lying.
[20:55.650 --> 20:57.650]  So, the cons of seeds.
[20:57.650 --> 21:00.650]  If you need, you've got to learn each phenotype.
[21:00.650 --> 21:02.650]  Like, when you find those phenotypes, you've got to learn them.
[21:02.650 --> 21:03.650]  You've got to learn them.
[21:03.650 --> 21:05.650]  It's like having three different girlfriends if you found three keepers.
[21:05.650 --> 21:07.650]  One's going to like a lot of nitrogen.
[21:07.650 --> 21:09.650]  One's going to get mad at too much nitrogen.
[21:09.650 --> 21:11.650]  One's going to be really picky.
[21:11.650 --> 21:12.650]  One's going to be really easy.
[21:12.650 --> 21:13.650]  One's going to butt out.
[21:13.650 --> 21:14.650]  One's going to taste real good.
[21:14.650 --> 21:16.650]  You're going to have to learn each phenotype.
[21:16.650 --> 21:17.650]  One may go a little longer.
[21:17.650 --> 21:19.650]  One may come down a little sooner.
[21:19.650 --> 21:21.650]  One may need to be topped.
[21:21.650 --> 21:23.650]  One may climb up into the fucking lights real high.
[21:23.650 --> 21:25.650]  You've got to learn all that stuff.
[21:25.650 --> 21:28.650]  The con, of course, that comes with that is wasted space.
[21:28.650 --> 21:33.650]  So, if you're a cash cropper, the seeds, that kind of messes you up.
[21:33.650 --> 21:35.650]  But what about fem seeds?
[21:35.650 --> 21:36.650]  I've seen it.
[21:36.650 --> 21:38.650]  I mean, I've grown fem seeds.
[21:38.650 --> 21:40.650]  I've made and grown shit tons of fem seeds.
[21:40.650 --> 21:46.650]  They take away the worry about having a male.
[21:46.650 --> 21:50.650]  There are still chances where you'll get some funky stuff, but you've just got to still pay attention.
[21:50.650 --> 21:51.650]  I've made some funky stuff.
[21:51.650 --> 21:56.650]  You've grown some funky stuff for me that I'm not even going to say the strain to discourage anybody.
[21:56.650 --> 21:58.650]  It's still good, though. Don't worry.
[21:58.650 --> 22:00.650]  Yeah, because I'm seeing excellent phenotypes coming out.
[22:00.650 --> 22:02.650]  I've got some downstairs that looks gnarly.
[22:02.650 --> 22:09.650]  Spence grew one that shot out a stick with a gigantic leaf the size of bigger than my hand,
[22:09.650 --> 22:12.650]  and then another stick, and then normal-sized leaves.
[22:12.650 --> 22:15.650]  I don't even remember what went on because I just looked away.
[22:15.650 --> 22:17.650]  It was like seeing a car wreck.
[22:17.650 --> 22:19.650]  You can look for a minute, but then you're like, fuck.
[22:19.650 --> 22:23.650]  It had a reattached, amputated arm.
[22:23.650 --> 22:24.650]  But it was cool.
[22:24.650 --> 22:26.650]  Sometimes I like things like that.
[22:26.650 --> 22:30.650]  If it's going to be a female, I'm the type of girl where I'll give it a chance.
[22:30.650 --> 22:32.650]  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work.
[22:32.650 --> 22:34.650]  There's always more seeds to plant.
[22:34.650 --> 22:35.650]  There are always more seeds.
[22:35.650 --> 22:37.650]  Don't be afraid to cull something.
[22:37.650 --> 22:42.650]  If you guys have something that is a level 8, let's work on getting you guys a level 10 out of the seed pack.
[22:42.650 --> 22:43.650]  Go find that 10.
[22:43.650 --> 22:45.650]  Get you some good seeds, some regulars or fins.
[22:45.650 --> 22:46.650]  Spartan babies.
[22:46.650 --> 22:47.650]  Yeah, exactly.
[22:47.650 --> 22:48.650]  Survival of the fittest.
[22:48.650 --> 22:49.650]  Spartan babies.
[22:49.650 --> 22:50.650]  Survival of the fittest.
[22:50.650 --> 22:55.650]  I know seeds are expensive and we just talk like you can just pop more, but it's well worth it.
[22:55.650 --> 22:57.650]  And if you're growing herb, you should be doing all right.
[22:57.650 --> 23:00.650]  You should at least be able to afford a pack of seeds after the harvest.
[23:00.650 --> 23:01.650]  So I mentioned fem seeds.
[23:01.650 --> 23:03.650]  Fem seeds, just a quick little...
[23:04.650 --> 23:05.650]  That's a red rat in the background there.
[23:05.650 --> 23:06.650]  That got my attention.
[23:06.650 --> 23:07.650]  We're going to turn up the music.
[23:07.650 --> 23:08.650]  We're going to dance around like Wookies for a second.
[23:08.650 --> 23:09.650]  Here we go.
[23:11.650 --> 23:12.650]  All right, let's take a dab.
[23:12.650 --> 23:13.650]  We'll remember where we were.
[23:13.650 --> 23:14.650]  Take a dab with us, guys.
[23:14.650 --> 23:16.650]  We got some really cool ass people in the room today.
[23:16.650 --> 23:18.650]  I'm really honored to have these guys as guests.
[23:18.650 --> 23:19.650]  I got some acid in the car.
[23:20.650 --> 23:22.650]  You just said dance around like Wookies.
[23:23.650 --> 23:26.650]  Wow, that was a really random statement to say on a recording.
[23:26.650 --> 23:28.650]  I'm really high, so...
[23:29.650 --> 23:30.650]  He didn't mean that.
[23:30.650 --> 23:31.650]  That was a joke.
[23:31.650 --> 23:32.650]  Yeah, I actually...
[23:33.650 --> 23:35.650]  Battery acid doesn't do anything.
[23:35.650 --> 23:36.650]  I'm going to grab this torch out of your way.
[23:36.650 --> 23:37.650]  It was a joke, guys.
[23:39.650 --> 23:40.650]  Which rig you going for, Spence?
[23:43.650 --> 23:44.650]  Do it.
[23:44.650 --> 23:47.650]  You can hit the Hitman cake with a highly educated titanium domeless nail.
[23:48.650 --> 23:50.650]  There's some stuff in the works with highly educated right now.
[23:53.650 --> 23:55.650]  There's that classic reggae air horn.
[23:55.650 --> 23:56.650]  Gotta love it.
[23:58.650 --> 23:59.650]  I know, we were doing a podcast.
[23:59.650 --> 24:01.650]  Now suddenly we're taking a break and dabbing, guys.
[24:01.650 --> 24:02.650]  I hope you like the way potheads work.
[24:03.650 --> 24:05.650]  I hope you're taking a dab while I am, too.
[24:05.650 --> 24:06.650]  That'd only be right.
[24:09.920 --> 24:10.920]  Grab that beer rig, Jess.
[24:10.920 --> 24:11.920]  Take a dab with us.
[24:11.920 --> 24:12.920]  We'll have a three rig session.
[24:12.920 --> 24:14.920]  There aren't three torches, but we'll make it happen.
[24:15.920 --> 24:21.430]  That's some Terpex, if you want that.
[24:21.430 --> 24:23.430]  There's some live over there.
[24:24.430 --> 24:25.430]  We're spoiled here in Colorado.
[24:29.430 --> 24:32.430]  If we were in Texas, this table would equal life in prison.
[24:33.430 --> 24:35.430]  And you're black, so that's two lives.
[24:35.430 --> 24:38.430]  Hey, you won't catch me there, I promise that.
[24:40.430 --> 24:48.690]  The best thing about Texas is seeing the state line in your rear view.
[24:48.690 --> 24:51.690]  I don't have a reason to go to Texas or a reason to hate on Texas, really.
[24:51.690 --> 24:53.690]  I don't have a reason to go there.
[24:53.690 --> 24:55.690]  They got some bomb food and people down there know how to party.
[24:55.690 --> 24:56.690]  You know what?
[24:56.690 --> 24:58.690]  I've got some good friends that are from Texas and they're actually all good people.
[24:58.690 --> 25:00.690]  I just lost my headphones.
[25:00.690 --> 25:02.690]  They die out, we'll tap on the thing and they'll work again.
[25:06.690 --> 25:07.690]  Are your headphones working, bro?
[25:08.690 --> 25:20.560]  There you go.
[25:20.560 --> 25:21.560]  Cool.
[25:21.560 --> 25:26.560]  If you guys are buying gear for a podcast, never buy a Livewire Solutions headphone 4 channel.
[25:26.560 --> 25:28.560]  This is the third one I've gotten, dude.
[25:28.560 --> 25:30.560]  And I know you're like, why'd you get a third one?
[25:30.560 --> 25:33.560]  Because if you go to Guitar Center with it and you yell at them, they keep just giving you a fresh one.
[25:33.560 --> 25:35.560]  So just keep reusing it.
[25:38.560 --> 25:44.660]  All right, so three people just smoked a gram of hash and like three dabs, one dab each.
[25:45.660 --> 25:47.660]  I got some on my phone I'm gonna take later.
[25:50.660 --> 25:53.660]  Your phone is probably the only thing without hash in it.
[25:53.660 --> 25:55.660]  I don't know if you have a phone.
[25:55.660 --> 25:59.660]  Your phone is probably the only thing without hash on it up until now.
[26:00.660 --> 26:01.660]  Pretty much.
[26:01.660 --> 26:02.660]  My life.
[26:03.660 --> 26:04.660]  Everything is all sticky.
[26:04.660 --> 26:06.660]  I wanted to call the recording studio the Sticky Knob Studios.
[26:07.660 --> 26:09.660]  Sounds a little bit funky.
[26:10.660 --> 26:11.660]  I thought people might take that wrong.
[26:11.660 --> 26:12.660]  Brown chicka brown.
[26:13.660 --> 26:14.660]  Brown chicka brown.
[26:14.660 --> 26:16.660]  That part of the show is brought to you by Oil Slick.
[26:16.660 --> 26:18.660]  Oil Slick, tools to help you concentrate.
[26:19.660 --> 26:22.660]  I just set my stuff down on this fancy Oil Slick pad here.
[26:22.660 --> 26:24.660]  I'm not gonna get any sticky rings on my table.
[26:24.660 --> 26:25.660]  That's awesome.
[26:25.660 --> 26:27.660]  That's a really nice Oil Slick pad there.
[26:27.660 --> 26:29.660]  Don't you work at a hydro shop?
[26:29.660 --> 26:30.660]  What were they called again?
[26:30.660 --> 26:31.660]  Hygro.
[26:31.660 --> 26:33.660]  They're called Hygro Pueblo.
[26:33.660 --> 26:34.660]  Check out Hygro.
[26:34.660 --> 26:35.660]  They're awesome over there.
[26:35.660 --> 26:37.660]  Jesse does a lot of lifting and moving.
[26:37.660 --> 26:40.660]  So all the organization and stuff, give shout outs to Jesse.
[26:41.660 --> 26:43.660]  Working in the fucking hot Colorado heat.
[26:43.660 --> 26:44.660]  It's August 9th.
[26:44.660 --> 26:46.660]  I want to give a quick shout out to Jerry Garcia.
[26:47.660 --> 26:49.660]  Much love, much respect, Jerry Garcia.
[26:49.660 --> 26:50.660]  Jerry changed my life, dude.
[26:50.660 --> 26:52.660]  I never got to see Jerry live.
[26:52.660 --> 26:56.660]  But the music of the Grateful Dead and the culture of the Grateful Dead are definitely in my heart.
[26:56.660 --> 26:58.660]  That is a big part of my world.
[26:58.660 --> 27:00.660]  So we'll get back to the point here.
[27:00.660 --> 27:04.660]  Podcast time, feminized seeds, always females most of the time.
[27:04.660 --> 27:07.660]  I'll say 99% of the time females.
[27:07.660 --> 27:13.660]  Jesse told us a story before about a dispensary owner running 200 and something feminized seeds and having four males.
[27:13.660 --> 27:15.660]  Perfect math, fucked up everything.
[27:15.660 --> 27:16.660]  Yeah.
[27:16.660 --> 27:17.660]  Did you get a bunch of seeds?
[27:18.660 --> 27:19.660]  What was that?
[27:19.660 --> 27:20.660]  Sorry.
[27:20.660 --> 27:21.660]  Sorry.
[27:21.660 --> 27:22.660]  Dab hit, kind of.
[27:22.660 --> 27:24.660]  I just saw your brain go blank.
[27:25.660 --> 27:31.660]  Like when you're at a house and your fucking ballast clicks in and the lights go dim real quick, you just went blink and you came back right fast.
[27:31.660 --> 27:32.660]  Like, where were we?
[27:33.660 --> 27:36.660]  Did you get a bunch of seeds from that run where the dispensary owner fucked it all up?
[27:36.660 --> 27:37.660]  Yeah, they had a bunch of seeds.
[27:37.660 --> 27:38.660]  Oh, man.
[27:38.660 --> 27:40.660]  And then they tried to sell them too.
[27:41.660 --> 27:42.660]  Well, that's a dispensary for you.
[27:42.660 --> 27:43.660]  Yeah, they had no idea.
[27:43.660 --> 27:47.660]  And the problem with fem seeds, me being a feminized seed maker, I know this is the big problem.
[27:47.660 --> 27:54.660]  You don't know you've got a problem until like week seven or week eight when you've already invested a lot of time into that plant.
[27:54.660 --> 27:58.660]  So if you're running fem seeds, my advice, and this is what I do, I flower them little.
[27:58.660 --> 28:00.660]  I run them in a three gallon pot.
[28:00.660 --> 28:03.660]  I veg them for very minimal time until I can take three cuts off of them.
[28:03.660 --> 28:07.660]  And once they're all big enough for three cuts, I flower them out the first time to find out what I've got.
[28:07.660 --> 28:10.660]  And then you can find out if you've got trouble or if you've got gold.
[28:11.660 --> 28:14.660]  So go early with the fems if you can, just to find out.
[28:14.660 --> 28:16.660]  I would do that with any plant.
[28:16.660 --> 28:19.660]  I've had some fire seeds from fem.
[28:19.660 --> 28:20.660]  That's an odd noise.
[28:20.660 --> 28:21.660]  You don't hear that?
[28:21.660 --> 28:22.660]  That could be Spence's phone.
[28:22.660 --> 28:24.660]  Somebody was growing hops.
[28:24.660 --> 28:25.660]  That shit was tight.
[28:25.660 --> 28:26.660]  On your phone?
[28:26.660 --> 28:27.660]  Yeah.
[28:27.660 --> 28:28.660]  Growing hops?
[28:28.660 --> 28:29.660]  Yeah.
[28:29.660 --> 28:30.660]  It looked like weed?
[28:30.660 --> 28:31.660]  It's related to weed.
[28:31.660 --> 28:32.660]  It's like the cousin.
[28:32.660 --> 28:33.660]  Just like a black cousin.
[28:33.660 --> 28:35.660]  It's kind of like a black cousin.
[28:35.660 --> 28:36.660]  A viney plant.
[28:36.660 --> 28:37.660]  That's my nigga hops.
[28:37.660 --> 28:39.660]  Shout out to hops.
[28:39.660 --> 28:40.660]  I could say that.
[28:40.660 --> 28:41.660]  Spence said I could say that.
[28:41.660 --> 28:42.660]  I could say that.
[28:42.660 --> 28:43.660]  That's cool.
[28:43.660 --> 28:45.660]  I can't believe I just said that on the podcast.
[28:45.660 --> 28:46.660]  It's all good.
[28:46.660 --> 28:48.660]  He makes me say shout out to my nigga Spence.
[28:48.660 --> 28:51.660]  I gave him his pass a year and a half ago.
[28:51.660 --> 28:52.660]  It's okay.
[28:52.660 --> 28:54.660]  Yeah, I got my pass, y'all.
[28:54.660 --> 28:56.660]  That's funny you guys brought up beer.
[28:56.660 --> 28:57.660]  Whoa.
[28:57.660 --> 28:58.660]  Nice.
[28:58.660 --> 28:59.660]  You can hear now?
[28:59.660 --> 29:00.660]  Yeah.
[29:00.660 --> 29:01.660]  Cool.
[29:01.660 --> 29:02.660]  I can kind of hear now.
[29:02.660 --> 29:03.660]  I can really hear.
[29:03.660 --> 29:05.660]  I have a beer making friend.
[29:05.660 --> 29:09.660]  We had a serious conversation last night about making a marijuana beer.
[29:09.660 --> 29:12.660]  I don't drink, but I would try one of those.
[29:12.660 --> 29:13.660]  Yeah.
[29:13.660 --> 29:14.660]  Just to say I drink a marijuana beer.
[29:14.660 --> 29:15.660]  One.
[29:15.660 --> 29:16.660]  Spence and I might split it.
[29:16.660 --> 29:17.660]  Yeah, for sure.
[29:17.660 --> 29:19.660]  I get a little turn off one beer.
[29:19.660 --> 29:22.660]  We were talking about a really small recipe.
[29:22.660 --> 29:29.660]  And then you could ferment that beer in your grow room and use your weed beer CO2 to enhance your ganja plants.
[29:29.660 --> 29:30.660]  There you go.
[29:30.660 --> 29:31.660]  Would that be a little sacrilegious?
[29:31.660 --> 29:32.660]  Cannibalistic almost?
[29:32.660 --> 29:35.660]  Here's your fermenting brothers.
[29:35.660 --> 29:36.660]  If you want it to be.
[29:36.660 --> 29:37.660]  If you want it to be.
[29:37.660 --> 29:38.660]  All right.
[29:38.660 --> 29:40.660]  I'm going to go ahead and get some more of that.
[29:40.660 --> 29:41.660]  Shout out to beer.
[29:41.660 --> 29:42.660]  I miss you beer.
[29:42.660 --> 29:43.660]  I haven't had a beer in a long, long time.
[29:43.660 --> 29:44.660]  I'm better off without it.
[29:44.660 --> 29:45.660]  You know, I haven't had a beer since I got my very first medical marijuana card.
[29:45.660 --> 29:46.660]  That's when I was like, you know, I don't need to drink.
[29:46.660 --> 29:47.660]  I got the card.
[29:47.660 --> 29:48.660]  I can smoke all the herb I want.
[29:48.660 --> 29:49.660]  That's awesome.
[29:49.660 --> 29:50.660]  Yeah.
[29:50.660 --> 29:51.660]  Nice trade off with myself.
[29:51.660 --> 29:52.660]  My dad kind of sorted it.
[29:52.660 --> 29:53.660]  It's the same thing.
[29:53.660 --> 29:54.660]  He still drinks occasionally.
[29:54.660 --> 29:55.660]  Shout out to Mr. Witt.
[29:55.660 --> 29:56.660]  If you're listening to the show, man, what's up, bro?
[29:56.660 --> 29:57.660]  It's me.
[29:57.660 --> 29:58.660]  What's up, pops?
[29:58.660 --> 29:59.660]  I'm going to go ahead and get some more of that.
[29:59.660 --> 30:00.660]  I'm going to go ahead and get some more of that.
[30:00.660 --> 30:29.660]  I'm going to go ahead and get some more of that.
[30:29.660 --> 30:30.980]  Gages F1s.
[30:30.980 --> 30:34.300]  There's not as much variation as what you're saying?
[30:34.300 --> 30:35.140]  Right.
[30:35.140 --> 30:36.340]  Fem seeds are more uniform.
[30:36.340 --> 30:36.940]  They're closer.
[30:36.940 --> 30:37.780]  They look a lot alike.
[30:37.780 --> 30:39.460]  When we run Gages F1s, we never know
[30:39.460 --> 30:40.580]  what we're going to get.
[30:40.580 --> 30:43.820]  A 10-pack varies so much, unless it was aspirar.
[30:43.820 --> 30:44.860]  Those were awesome.
[30:44.860 --> 30:48.380]  Do you suppose that's because they are supposedly
[30:48.380 --> 30:50.340]  missing the male chromosomes?
[30:50.340 --> 30:52.540]  That and you're not introducing.
[30:52.540 --> 30:56.020]  It feels like when you're bringing out the F1s,
[30:56.020 --> 30:58.220]  I feel like you're getting a lot of recessive traits.
[30:58.220 --> 30:59.620]  And you're just not bringing them.
[30:59.620 --> 31:02.460]  Maybe because of the male chromosomes are missing.
[31:02.460 --> 31:04.180]  But it feels like you're not going back
[31:04.180 --> 31:05.060]  as far in the lineage.
[31:05.060 --> 31:07.380]  They forgot who their grandparents were somehow,
[31:07.380 --> 31:08.380]  just by selfing them.
[31:08.380 --> 31:09.700]  It's what it feels like.
[31:09.700 --> 31:13.660]  And I'm also doing a lot of selfing of one plant
[31:13.660 --> 31:16.020]  and using it to pollinate the same strain.
[31:16.020 --> 31:17.460]  So those are starting to come out.
[31:17.460 --> 31:18.380]  I've done that.
[31:18.380 --> 31:21.940]  I'm on the, it's inbred, but it's kind of an F3
[31:21.940 --> 31:23.220]  is what level I'm at.
[31:23.220 --> 31:24.820]  So an S3.
[31:24.820 --> 31:25.740]  Yeah.
[31:25.740 --> 31:28.380]  The Grateful Dog S3, they are almost all
[31:28.380 --> 31:29.540]  looking the same by now.
[31:29.540 --> 31:30.380]  Oh, nice.
[31:30.380 --> 31:31.380]  I had no idea.
[31:31.380 --> 31:32.380]  Awesome props on that.
[31:32.380 --> 31:33.220]  Well, thank you.
[31:33.220 --> 31:35.740]  That's a dank strain, by the way.
[31:35.740 --> 31:37.540]  That's the one that put me on the map, honestly.
[31:37.540 --> 31:39.460]  Shout out to the Cali Connection and Swerve
[31:39.460 --> 31:41.500]  because just shout out to those guys.
[31:41.500 --> 31:42.340]  They did me a favor.
[31:42.340 --> 31:43.180]  So shout out.
[31:44.500 --> 31:47.300]  Yeah, I was gonna actually bring up in this conversation
[31:47.300 --> 31:50.820]  that there's so many S1s and F1s out there.
[31:50.820 --> 31:55.580]  And we were talking about protecting the lineage
[31:55.580 --> 31:56.660]  and everything.
[31:56.700 --> 32:00.580]  And you can't really do that with F1s, S1s.
[32:00.580 --> 32:01.540]  Yeah, you gotta F3 it.
[32:01.540 --> 32:02.380]  You gotta get to F3.
[32:02.380 --> 32:04.140]  F3, F4, you know.
[32:04.140 --> 32:06.060]  DJ Short says F2 is crucial.
[32:06.060 --> 32:06.900]  Really?
[32:06.900 --> 32:08.100]  That's where a lot of stuff is really
[32:08.100 --> 32:09.060]  where you gotta pay attention.
[32:09.060 --> 32:11.700]  Because I've fucked up the F2s.
[32:11.700 --> 32:13.340]  I've been like, oh no, I used the wrong,
[32:13.340 --> 32:17.420]  I chose the wrong F1 to put to that.
[32:17.420 --> 32:18.980]  And then was like, nope, that's not.
[32:18.980 --> 32:21.220]  I gotta go find a different male out of this mix
[32:21.220 --> 32:22.780]  because this is not, or a different female
[32:22.780 --> 32:23.940]  and try this again.
[32:23.940 --> 32:24.780]  For sure.
[32:24.780 --> 32:26.300]  You just have to go back.
[32:26.940 --> 32:27.900]  You have to keep seeds of each one
[32:27.900 --> 32:29.900]  and label them what they were.
[32:29.900 --> 32:33.460]  This is the, I'll say, golden goat times daybreaker.
[32:33.460 --> 32:36.220]  This is the first run and make sure that those are legit.
[32:36.220 --> 32:38.540]  And then I wanna find a golden goat dominant one
[32:38.540 --> 32:41.140]  out of there and hit it again with the daybreaker male.
[32:41.140 --> 32:45.220]  And I'm hoping to make it look a lot like daybreaker
[32:45.220 --> 32:46.540]  and smell like golden goat.
[32:46.540 --> 32:48.420]  I have the goat's vigor.
[32:48.420 --> 32:52.180]  Vigor, but if it doesn't, I could just have to back up again
[32:52.180 --> 32:55.140]  and go find another female to use and just keep, yeah.
[32:55.140 --> 32:56.340]  Eventually I'll ditch a project
[32:56.340 --> 32:58.780]  if I have to go back too many times, twice.
[32:58.780 --> 33:00.340]  If I don't get it the first or second time,
[33:00.340 --> 33:01.900]  I'm like, yeah, that obviously doesn't wanna do
[33:01.900 --> 33:03.220]  what I want it to do.
[33:03.220 --> 33:04.700]  Out of so many seeds, you should get what you want
[33:04.700 --> 33:06.960]  the first or second try.
[33:08.140 --> 33:10.780]  The depot dog strain I had, or have,
[33:11.700 --> 33:14.220]  I had to do it three times before I was happy
[33:14.220 --> 33:15.420]  with it the first time.
[33:15.420 --> 33:16.260]  There you go.
[33:16.260 --> 33:17.100]  And then continued from there.
[33:17.100 --> 33:18.500]  Yeah.
[33:18.500 --> 33:20.380]  Due to leaks and stuff like that.
[33:20.380 --> 33:21.620]  Oh man, yeah.
[33:21.620 --> 33:23.180]  And something in me says if it doesn't work
[33:23.180 --> 33:24.820]  the first time or the second time,
[33:25.500 --> 33:27.100]  I'm probably not gonna get what I want.
[33:27.100 --> 33:30.140]  I keep cutting that music out a little too much, sorry.
[33:30.140 --> 33:32.700]  Here's a random, this is kind of off topic, but on topic.
[33:32.700 --> 33:34.380]  How do you guys feel, have you seen where Arian
[33:34.380 --> 33:36.820]  goes to places, Arian from Greenhouse Seeds,
[33:36.820 --> 33:39.220]  they travel to places and get land-raised genetics
[33:39.220 --> 33:41.620]  from, I'll say Jamaica, and they went to like,
[33:42.860 --> 33:45.080]  they went to somewhere in India, Nepal or somewhere like
[33:45.080 --> 33:46.500]  that, I don't pay enough attention.
[33:46.500 --> 33:48.960]  I just have to watch things quickly while I'm trimming.
[33:48.960 --> 33:50.460]  So they go to these places and they get
[33:50.460 --> 33:51.740]  their land-raised seeds.
[33:52.620 --> 33:57.180]  And so now Arian's got all land-raises from everywhere.
[33:57.180 --> 34:00.820]  But in exchange, he leaves them a handful of.
[34:00.820 --> 34:01.660]  Reg seeds.
[34:01.660 --> 34:02.480]  Fem seeds.
[34:02.480 --> 34:03.320]  Fem seeds.
[34:03.320 --> 34:04.140]  Fem seeds and regs.
[34:04.140 --> 34:05.820]  He'll give them fems and regs, but he gives them
[34:05.820 --> 34:08.920]  handfuls of seeds to grow and he tells them what they are.
[34:08.920 --> 34:11.460]  But now those land-raises are gone.
[34:11.460 --> 34:13.300]  Yeah, because they're crossed back over.
[34:13.300 --> 34:14.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[34:14.140 --> 34:15.820]  It's just open pollination of it, they don't care.
[34:15.820 --> 34:17.620]  And he just made off with the last of them.
[34:17.620 --> 34:19.520]  With the last of the land-raised seeds.
[34:19.520 --> 34:23.440]  Introducing hybrids and modern and developed world
[34:23.440 --> 34:26.920]  genetics into fragile places that have land-raised
[34:26.920 --> 34:28.360]  genetics like that is a,
[34:30.680 --> 34:33.200]  that's kind of a douchebag thing to do.
[34:33.200 --> 34:35.040]  That's the nicest way I can say it.
[34:35.040 --> 34:39.200]  It's the same thing as releasing fucking animals
[34:39.200 --> 34:40.520]  that are not from that area.
[34:40.520 --> 34:41.400]  Yeah, for sure.
[34:41.400 --> 34:42.920]  Or insects that are not from that area.
[34:42.920 --> 34:44.480]  They're gonna wreak havoc on shit and destroy
[34:44.480 --> 34:46.040]  the ecosystem that's already there.
[34:46.040 --> 34:47.160]  Disrupt the balance.
[34:47.200 --> 34:50.240]  Or asking all the farmers to grow some GMO corn.
[34:50.240 --> 34:52.560]  Yeah, he's kind of doing the same thing to them.
[34:52.560 --> 34:53.400]  Yeah.
[34:53.400 --> 34:54.520]  Yeah, huh.
[34:54.520 --> 34:56.400]  You guys think about that when you're doing
[34:56.400 --> 34:57.240]  what you're doing.
[34:57.240 --> 34:58.480]  Kind of think about the effects that you're having,
[34:58.480 --> 35:00.080]  like the ripples that you make in your life.
[35:00.080 --> 35:03.280]  Because little stuff makes big, big ripples.
[35:03.280 --> 35:06.440]  What's that saying about a butterfly in the rain forest
[35:06.440 --> 35:08.360]  and a monsoon somewhere else?
[35:08.360 --> 35:12.280]  Yeah, yeah, if a hippie scratches his nuts in Pueblo,
[35:12.280 --> 35:13.840]  there's a tidal wave in China somewhere.
[35:13.840 --> 35:15.440]  Something like that happens.
[35:15.440 --> 35:17.080]  Yeah, keep that in mind.
[35:18.000 --> 35:19.680]  All you hippies scratching your nuts, be careful.
[35:19.680 --> 35:21.080]  You're causing tidal waves.
[35:21.080 --> 35:23.560]  All right, so that was a random rant
[35:23.560 --> 35:25.040]  on the pros and cons of seed.
[35:25.040 --> 35:27.920]  So I guess the, it's still, I think they're equal
[35:27.920 --> 35:28.760]  in my opinion.
[35:28.760 --> 35:30.360]  I think there's benefits of both.
[35:30.360 --> 35:31.520]  There's a reason to run seeds
[35:31.520 --> 35:33.480]  and there's a benefit to run clones.
[35:33.480 --> 35:36.960]  And as a seed breeder, I should probably big up the seeds
[35:36.960 --> 35:37.800]  a little bit more.
[35:37.800 --> 35:40.040]  But to tell you the truth, all those famous cuts
[35:40.040 --> 35:43.440]  that you're getting, they're a famous cut for a reason.
[35:43.440 --> 35:46.360]  So we all have, everybody in this room grows the cookies.
[35:46.400 --> 35:49.120]  Everybody in this room's got a Gorilla Glue four cut.
[35:49.120 --> 35:49.960]  So.
[35:49.960 --> 35:50.800]  No, not yet.
[35:50.800 --> 35:52.240]  Oh, you will by the end of the day then.
[35:52.240 --> 35:53.360]  Oh, word.
[35:53.360 --> 35:55.680]  Shaming in the TV.
[35:55.680 --> 35:57.760]  Shee, I could use another cut of that.
[35:58.880 --> 36:00.880]  I saw your Instagram spins.
[36:00.880 --> 36:02.760]  Yeah, we all saw that beautiful Gorilla Glue.
[36:02.760 --> 36:03.600]  Who'd that come from?
[36:03.600 --> 36:04.920]  Do you want to give someone a shout out?
[36:04.920 --> 36:07.600]  Shout out to Mariano's Clones.
[36:07.600 --> 36:09.160]  That's his Instagram.
[36:09.160 --> 36:11.440]  He's out of Cali, Southern Cali, not Southern Cali,
[36:11.440 --> 36:12.560]  maybe like Central Cali.
[36:12.560 --> 36:13.600]  Central Cali, okay.
[36:13.840 --> 36:18.280]  Um, probably some of the best clones I've ever received
[36:18.280 --> 36:23.280]  as far as a month, or I got them like a month
[36:24.120 --> 36:25.680]  and four days ago or something.
[36:25.680 --> 36:28.400]  And they have literally blown the fuck up.
[36:28.400 --> 36:29.240]  I've seen pictures.
[36:29.240 --> 36:30.080]  They're healthy, they're happy.
[36:30.080 --> 36:32.680]  Check out at Garden of Weeden on Instagram.
[36:32.680 --> 36:35.160]  Garden of Weed, capital N at the end of it.
[36:35.160 --> 36:38.160]  It's all attached to the Garden of Weeden.
[36:38.160 --> 36:42.400]  There's websites, Facebook, Tumblr.
[36:43.880 --> 36:44.720]  That's it.
[36:44.720 --> 36:45.680]  Instagram.
[36:45.680 --> 36:46.520]  Instagram.
[36:46.520 --> 36:47.360]  Yeah.
[36:47.360 --> 36:48.920]  We did not talk about auto flower plants.
[36:48.920 --> 36:50.440]  It's one thing I wanted to mention.
[36:50.440 --> 36:52.640]  That's okay, let's just get, whatever.
[36:52.640 --> 36:54.920]  That's kind of how I feel.
[36:54.920 --> 36:57.600]  Auto flower plants are, that's just, I will never breed.
[36:57.600 --> 36:59.800]  People always ask me if I will make an auto flower
[36:59.800 --> 37:01.040]  as a breeder and I always say no.
[37:01.040 --> 37:04.200]  That's, that's not for big boys.
[37:04.200 --> 37:05.720]  And then some people are going to hate me for saying that.
[37:05.720 --> 37:07.240]  If you need a fast production crop
[37:07.240 --> 37:09.880]  and you're not familiar with the cannabis plant,
[37:09.880 --> 37:10.920]  that may work for you,
[37:10.920 --> 37:13.960]  but it's not connoisseur grade herb in my opinion.
[37:13.960 --> 37:18.160]  Jesse and I are familiar with one epic freaking use
[37:18.160 --> 37:20.640]  of auto flower plants to discredit
[37:20.640 --> 37:22.040]  all the shit I just talked.
[37:23.560 --> 37:26.640]  We live in a community that is about 40 minutes away
[37:26.640 --> 37:28.800]  from a national forest, maybe an hour,
[37:28.800 --> 37:31.280]  depending on which routes you take.
[37:31.280 --> 37:35.960]  There was a legendary fucking bust of,
[37:35.960 --> 37:39.120]  there was a Mexican cartel in the national forest
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.360]  running a giant grow operation all year long,
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.840]  very covertly in like a valley that they were hiking in
[37:47.840 --> 37:48.680]  and hiking out.
[37:48.680 --> 37:49.500]  They were camped there.
[37:49.500 --> 37:50.760]  They found food there and said these guys
[37:50.760 --> 37:52.160]  had been camped for a month.
[37:52.160 --> 37:53.800]  Very, very covertly.
[37:53.800 --> 37:54.640]  Yeah.
[37:54.640 --> 37:56.080]  The people that own the land around there
[37:56.080 --> 37:59.760]  were oblivious to it and they had irrigation systems set up
[37:59.760 --> 38:01.520]  coming from the river, running downhill,
[38:01.520 --> 38:03.680]  watering all the plants.
[38:03.680 --> 38:04.520]  It was perfect.
[38:04.520 --> 38:05.800]  It was like a movie set up.
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.800]  I can, I mean, they had three different places.
[38:10.800 --> 38:11.720]  Did you go out there?
[38:11.720 --> 38:12.880]  Yeah, it was, I mean.
[38:12.880 --> 38:14.080]  It's hikeable.
[38:14.080 --> 38:15.320]  It's an area where we can hike to.
[38:15.320 --> 38:16.200]  Jess went out there and hiked,
[38:16.200 --> 38:17.200]  so we'll let him tell you about it.
[38:17.200 --> 38:22.200]  I mean, they clear cut a good seven acres of,
[38:23.120 --> 38:26.960]  you know, just prime national forest trees,
[38:26.960 --> 38:28.240]  you know, full size trees.
[38:28.240 --> 38:30.600]  Just cut them down, clear cut them.
[38:30.600 --> 38:35.600]  No thought to drainage or no respect for the environment.
[38:36.040 --> 38:36.880]  Whatsoever.
[38:37.760 --> 38:38.960]  To be the hippie.
[38:38.960 --> 38:41.000]  Yeah, well, I was told it was a mess out there.
[38:41.000 --> 38:44.880]  I knew one of the, not to blow too many fucking whistles,
[38:44.880 --> 38:48.400]  but I know a friend of mine's father is a retired cop.
[38:48.400 --> 38:49.800]  And he's cool as shit.
[38:49.800 --> 38:52.480]  My buddy's a dab head and dabs sitting on the couch
[38:52.480 --> 38:55.480]  next to his dad, who was a cop at the time.
[38:55.480 --> 38:57.200]  He was telling us that there were plants out there
[38:57.200 --> 38:58.560]  of all stages.
[38:58.560 --> 38:59.400]  Yes.
[38:59.400 --> 39:01.920]  Eight inches tall, 12 inches tall, three feet tall.
[39:01.920 --> 39:04.060]  And he said there were bags of buds
[39:04.100 --> 39:05.820]  and a manicuring station.
[39:05.820 --> 39:07.540]  And I was tripping out because when this place
[39:07.540 --> 39:10.980]  was discovered was not flowering season.
[39:10.980 --> 39:13.500]  It was like spring or some shit.
[39:13.500 --> 39:15.300]  And he was saying that they already had plants
[39:15.300 --> 39:17.740]  six foot tall, three foot tall with big buds on them
[39:17.740 --> 39:18.780]  in flower.
[39:18.780 --> 39:20.260]  And there's no way that they could have set up
[39:20.260 --> 39:23.380]  like a light depth out there on seven acres.
[39:23.380 --> 39:25.620]  I mean, without being busted.
[39:25.620 --> 39:27.580]  They were using auto flower plants,
[39:27.580 --> 39:30.660]  which that's the best use of auto flowers I could ever see.
[39:30.660 --> 39:32.540]  So if you're trying to do some crazy outdoor
[39:32.540 --> 39:35.340]  where you've got enough time before the cold,
[39:35.340 --> 39:37.180]  right after the cold, get those in the ground,
[39:37.180 --> 39:39.340]  you might be able to pull off an outdoor crop.
[39:39.340 --> 39:40.500]  Probably so.
[39:40.500 --> 39:41.340]  Yeah.
[39:41.340 --> 39:43.060]  I mean, they were living up there.
[39:43.060 --> 39:47.900]  They had quite a little city and I may have found a plant
[39:49.220 --> 39:51.740]  and may have moved it down just to see what happened.
[39:51.740 --> 39:54.260]  And yeah, it was totally an auto flower.
[39:54.260 --> 39:57.340]  Could there have been any seeds up there by chance?
[39:57.340 --> 39:58.540]  Probably so.
[39:58.540 --> 40:01.740]  The plant I found was actually a male auto flowering plant.
[40:02.500 --> 40:05.780]  Yeah, I killed it, burned it, stomped it into the ground.
[40:07.740 --> 40:09.460]  Yeah, fuck a male auto flower plant.
[40:09.460 --> 40:11.740]  Yeah, that's super, super dangerous.
[40:12.780 --> 40:14.140]  Yeah.
[40:14.140 --> 40:16.620]  This is just gonna bust in your room one day.
[40:16.620 --> 40:18.820]  Spencer's eyeballs are about to pop out of his head.
[40:18.820 --> 40:19.660]  Yeah.
[40:19.660 --> 40:21.500]  How do you feel when you find a male in the grow room
[40:21.500 --> 40:23.180]  about three weeks into flower?
[40:26.100 --> 40:29.260]  It's only happened like once and I don't know,
[40:29.300 --> 40:34.180]  it's probably one of the saddest, not saddest days, but.
[40:34.180 --> 40:36.500]  I can compare it to the feeling of when a condom breaks.
[40:36.500 --> 40:39.620]  Yeah, it's like you walk in the room and you,
[40:39.620 --> 40:42.180]  cause you can tell once it's like that far in,
[40:42.180 --> 40:44.340]  if you can't tell something's wrong.
[40:46.060 --> 40:48.380]  It's just kind of heartbreaking
[40:48.380 --> 40:49.980]  cause at that point you don't know,
[40:49.980 --> 40:52.380]  like you don't know what it hit, if it hit,
[40:52.380 --> 40:54.580]  if it's dropping pollen, is it not dropping pollen?
[40:54.580 --> 40:57.180]  There's just too many questions going on.
[40:57.180 --> 40:59.500]  And then when you find some seeds in your nugs,
[41:00.580 --> 41:02.180]  a month and a half or three months later,
[41:02.180 --> 41:04.420]  it's like, well, damn, there it goes.
[41:04.420 --> 41:05.340]  There's the results.
[41:05.340 --> 41:07.220]  Yeah, saw it go, oops.
[41:07.220 --> 41:08.420]  So guys pay attention with the males,
[41:08.420 --> 41:10.100]  that plant in the back.
[41:10.100 --> 41:13.180]  Yeah, if you see a yellow dust on your leaf,
[41:15.460 --> 41:18.060]  I discovered a male one time by that.
[41:18.060 --> 41:19.060]  Oops.
[41:19.060 --> 41:20.700]  Look at that, what, oh shit.
[41:22.060 --> 41:23.900]  Those nanners just erupted.
[41:23.900 --> 41:24.980]  Yeah, be careful.
[41:24.980 --> 41:26.340]  Keep an eye on your feminize seeds too
[41:26.340 --> 41:30.100]  because fem seeds can turn into hermaphrodites or males.
[41:31.260 --> 41:32.580]  I hope we actually covered something.
[41:32.580 --> 41:35.180]  We got dabbed as shit on this episode talking about this.
[41:35.180 --> 41:36.740]  So I hope we made some sort of sense.
[41:36.740 --> 41:38.620]  I want to stress my point again.
[41:38.620 --> 41:40.260]  Growing from seeds is awesome.
[41:40.260 --> 41:41.420]  Everything came from seed.
[41:41.420 --> 41:45.540]  Yeah, that's, if you grow for the curiosity
[41:45.540 --> 41:46.900]  and just the love of the plant
[41:46.900 --> 41:48.820]  and you've never grown from seed,
[41:48.820 --> 41:51.380]  well, I question your curiosity then.
[41:51.380 --> 41:53.740]  Well, if you grow from seed,
[41:53.740 --> 41:56.220]  I grow from seed cause there's a possibility
[41:57.060 --> 41:58.340]  of finding something that people don't have.
[41:58.340 --> 42:02.060]  And that's my answer for you right there.
[42:02.060 --> 42:03.900]  I would literally, I'll grow a pack of seeds
[42:03.900 --> 42:07.340]  to find a pheno that maybe two people
[42:07.340 --> 42:09.820]  out of what, couple hundred people
[42:09.820 --> 42:12.340]  that have bought in packs have.
[42:12.340 --> 42:14.540]  Who knows, one day that strain could be
[42:14.540 --> 42:15.740]  everything you want it to.
[42:15.740 --> 42:18.260]  And I've seen seeds, I forget the term for it,
[42:18.260 --> 42:20.820]  but I have bred seeds that the outcome
[42:20.820 --> 42:23.940]  has been better than both parents.
[42:23.940 --> 42:26.500]  I got more vigor and more trichomes
[42:26.500 --> 42:29.900]  than the two parents I used and I upgraded.
[42:29.900 --> 42:32.860]  So that's a good way to look at it.
[42:32.860 --> 42:34.580]  You got something in your brain there.
[42:34.580 --> 42:35.660]  I know that term.
[42:36.580 --> 42:39.300]  I think DJ Shortmite had recently said it.
[42:39.300 --> 42:40.900]  Somebody said it.
[42:40.900 --> 42:42.980]  I actually looked it up when he said it.
[42:42.980 --> 42:44.660]  Somebody tweeted to us at agroculture.
[42:44.660 --> 42:46.900]  I'll send you two iRegenetics stickers.
[42:48.420 --> 42:50.660]  I really will, I really, really will.
[42:50.660 --> 42:52.860]  Maybe something cooler if I can find something to send you.
[42:52.860 --> 42:54.780]  It will not be seeds or anything, I promise.
[42:54.780 --> 42:56.980]  I won't ship seeds, don't do that.
[42:56.980 --> 42:58.100]  Hey guys, stop shipping shit.
[42:58.100 --> 43:00.340]  A friend of ours got in trouble for shipping shit.
[43:00.340 --> 43:01.780]  I would call him a friend.
[43:01.780 --> 43:03.820]  Yeah, an acquaintance.
[43:03.820 --> 43:06.180]  This person in the community that is not anymore
[43:06.180 --> 43:08.740]  in the community got fucking busted shipping shit
[43:08.740 --> 43:09.660]  and it makes us all look bad.
[43:09.660 --> 43:12.420]  It makes Colorado look stupid, it makes you look stupid.
[43:12.420 --> 43:13.540]  Stop shipping shit, please.
[43:13.540 --> 43:15.380]  If you want some shit, come get it.
[43:15.380 --> 43:17.080]  It's legal in Colorado for 21.
[43:17.980 --> 43:19.220]  The dispensary has what you want.
[43:19.220 --> 43:21.140]  We don't have to mail it to you.
[43:21.140 --> 43:23.100]  Sorry to bust up anybody's business ring
[43:23.100 --> 43:24.260]  for making some money shipping shit,
[43:24.260 --> 43:25.820]  but there are plenty of sick people here.
[43:25.820 --> 43:27.340]  There are plenty of recreational people here.
[43:27.340 --> 43:30.060]  We fought to get this shit right here.
[43:30.060 --> 43:30.900]  It's legit here.
[43:30.900 --> 43:31.860]  Stop shipping shit.
[43:33.140 --> 43:34.180]  Everyone's got their heads.
[43:34.180 --> 43:37.060]  Yeah, fuck middlemen anyways.
[43:37.060 --> 43:38.300]  Yeah, grow your own.
[43:38.300 --> 43:39.380]  Go straight to the grower.
[43:39.380 --> 43:40.220]  Grow your own.
[43:40.220 --> 43:41.040]  If you're listening to this podcast,
[43:41.040 --> 43:42.080]  you're probably not one of the people
[43:42.080 --> 43:42.940]  that's shipping shit anyway,
[43:42.940 --> 43:43.860]  so I don't even need to bitch at you.
[43:43.860 --> 43:44.940]  You're growing your own herb.
[43:44.940 --> 43:46.420]  You got some quality dabs.
[43:46.420 --> 43:47.780]  You're hanging out with us.
[43:48.820 --> 43:50.180]  You guys got anything you wanna bullshit about?
[43:50.180 --> 43:51.020]  I like having you on.
[43:51.840 --> 43:52.980]  I don't need to cut off a conversation here
[43:52.980 --> 43:53.940]  just because I'm out of material
[43:53.940 --> 43:55.340]  to talk about on the seed stuff.
[43:55.340 --> 43:57.180]  You got anything fun to add?
[43:57.180 --> 43:59.540]  There was a story in the news.
[44:03.140 --> 44:04.340]  Shit, I can't remember.
[44:05.940 --> 44:06.940]  Huh, Jesse's high.
[44:06.940 --> 44:07.780]  Do you remember where you saw it?
[44:07.780 --> 44:08.600]  I'll go Google.
[44:08.600 --> 44:09.500]  I'll hit the cannabis right quick.
[44:09.500 --> 44:11.420]  All the weed news hits the cannabis.
[44:11.420 --> 44:12.340]  What was it about?
[44:13.420 --> 44:14.260]  I can't even remember.
[44:14.260 --> 44:15.080]  I think it was comical.
[44:15.080 --> 44:15.920]  That's what I'm trying to remember.
[44:15.920 --> 44:16.760]  Comical?
[44:16.760 --> 44:17.700]  Yeah.
[44:17.700 --> 44:20.980]  I wanna say I may have seen it in the post or something.
[44:21.820 --> 44:22.740]  I am not sponsored by the cannabis or anything.
[44:22.740 --> 44:24.860]  A lot of people disagree with what the cannabis says.
[44:24.860 --> 44:26.640]  Sometimes they print some articles that I will agree
[44:26.640 --> 44:28.260]  are fucking wacky.
[44:28.260 --> 44:29.460]  Right as I open the cannabis,
[44:29.460 --> 44:30.300]  there's an article that says,
[44:30.300 --> 44:34.560]  Cannabis Q&A, Grow Room Tour, and other reader questions.
[44:34.560 --> 44:35.580]  Check out that Grow Room Tour.
[44:35.580 --> 44:36.420]  I wanna read that.
[44:36.420 --> 44:38.060]  I haven't read it yet, but that'll be neat.
[44:38.060 --> 44:39.300]  Any Grow Room Tour is fun.
[44:39.300 --> 44:40.820]  You might learn something there.
[44:40.820 --> 44:42.340]  Ask me if you have questions about that.
[44:42.340 --> 44:44.380]  The three of us in this room,
[44:44.380 --> 44:46.880]  we could design and build you the most fucking amazing
[44:46.880 --> 44:48.540]  Grow Room that the three of us got together.
[44:48.540 --> 44:51.460]  God, somebody let me build one.
[44:51.460 --> 44:53.180]  Yeah, let the three of us build it.
[44:53.180 --> 44:54.580]  We'll crush it.
[44:54.580 --> 44:57.980]  It'll be the Lamborghini of a Grow Room.
[44:59.740 --> 45:01.820]  Bro, I don't see much on the cannabis
[45:01.820 --> 45:03.500]  worth reading on the show.
[45:03.500 --> 45:04.620]  Yeah.
[45:04.620 --> 45:05.540]  All right.
[45:05.540 --> 45:06.380]  Next time.
[45:06.380 --> 45:08.080]  Next time we'll have some news for you.
[45:08.080 --> 45:09.580]  I'll find something to read.
[45:10.460 --> 45:11.380]  You guys got anything cool to add?
[45:11.380 --> 45:13.900]  Shout out to everybody over at the Garden of Weden.
[45:13.900 --> 45:16.180]  While Spence is away, I hope they're all behaving themselves
[45:16.180 --> 45:17.680]  and having a good time.
[45:17.720 --> 45:21.640]  Big Mike, Matty, Slop, Nani's.
[45:21.640 --> 45:22.480]  Siroc Boy.
[45:22.480 --> 45:23.320]  Siroc Boy.
[45:23.320 --> 45:24.140]  Siroc Boy.
[45:24.140 --> 45:24.980]  Boy, what's up, boy?
[45:24.980 --> 45:25.820]  Earl.
[45:25.820 --> 45:26.640]  Earl.
[45:26.640 --> 45:27.480]  Earl.
[45:27.480 --> 45:28.320]  Indica.
[45:28.320 --> 45:29.140]  Indica.
[45:29.140 --> 45:30.080]  Damn, I got a house full.
[45:30.080 --> 45:31.560]  Ping Pong, Sloppy.
[45:31.560 --> 45:33.400]  Yeah, Ping Pong's not here, but shout out to him.
[45:33.400 --> 45:34.440]  Big shout out to Ping Pong.
[45:34.440 --> 45:35.400]  We love you always, bro.
[45:35.400 --> 45:36.640]  We miss you.
[45:36.640 --> 45:37.800]  Had to ship out.
[45:37.800 --> 45:40.560]  Had to ship out so you could shape up.
[45:40.560 --> 45:41.800]  What are Slop's little pup's names?
[45:41.800 --> 45:42.640]  Those are cute as fuck.
[45:42.640 --> 45:43.480]  I always forget.
[45:43.480 --> 45:44.300]  Bane and-
[45:44.300 --> 45:45.280]  Bane and Harvey.
[45:45.280 --> 45:47.120]  Harvey's the one I forget his name all the time.
[45:47.560 --> 45:48.920]  Those dogs are cute as shit.
[45:48.920 --> 45:51.000]  Good work on those two little pups, bro.
[45:51.000 --> 45:51.840]  For sure.
[45:51.840 --> 45:53.560]  All right, it doesn't sound like we got a lot.
[45:53.560 --> 45:55.080]  Uh-oh, you got something to say?
[45:55.080 --> 45:57.200]  Izzy and Pork Chop.
[45:57.200 --> 45:59.320]  Oh shit, Izzy, I missed Izzy, I'm sorry.
[45:59.320 --> 46:01.120]  I'm not very familiar with that one.
[46:01.120 --> 46:04.140]  Can we, can you pause recording real quick?
[46:04.140 --> 46:06.520]  I wanna ask Spencer a question.
[46:06.520 --> 46:07.360]  Yeah.
[46:07.360 --> 46:08.520]  I possibly have a story to tell.
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.700]  That's cool, I'll hit pause right here.
[46:10.700 --> 46:11.680]  Hold on, guys, we're gonna hit pause
[46:11.680 --> 46:13.040]  and make sure that what we can talk about
[46:13.040 --> 46:14.200]  is talk-aboutable on a show.
[46:14.200 --> 46:15.080]  Hold on.
[46:15.080 --> 46:16.560]  Actually, I'll just turn the mics down and the music up
[46:16.920 --> 46:18.320]  and you guys get down for half a second.
[46:25.720 --> 46:26.800]  All right, we're recording now.
[46:26.800 --> 46:27.640]  We're coming back.
[46:27.640 --> 46:28.460]  I am back.
[46:28.460 --> 46:29.300]  Yeah, we are back.
[46:29.300 --> 46:30.140]  Yo.
[46:30.140 --> 46:32.520]  Yo, that story was not appropriate for listeners.
[46:32.520 --> 46:34.000]  No, no.
[46:34.000 --> 46:35.440]  You missed a fucking hell of a story.
[46:35.440 --> 46:37.720]  I apologize, we can't air that.
[46:37.720 --> 46:38.640]  That's somebody's personal shit.
[46:38.640 --> 46:40.640]  Are there any events coming up?
[46:40.640 --> 46:42.880]  I think the Secret Cup's coming up, right?
[46:42.880 --> 46:43.700]  Yep.
[46:43.700 --> 46:45.280]  The Secret Cup.
[46:45.280 --> 46:48.600]  The regional is 30th and 31st,
[46:48.600 --> 46:50.920]  or the open vendor days where you can come
[46:51.040 --> 46:54.040]  and check it out, I guess.
[46:54.040 --> 46:57.080]  I think I've got my VIP spot set up.
[46:57.080 --> 46:58.240]  Yeah, I'll be there.
[47:00.120 --> 47:01.600]  There'll be a bunch of people, it'll be fun.
[47:01.600 --> 47:03.920]  Oh, everybody in the industry that is in Colorado
[47:03.920 --> 47:05.280]  will show up.
[47:05.280 --> 47:06.640]  Shout out to Big D for putting that on.
[47:06.640 --> 47:08.400]  We do a lot of shout outs on this show.
[47:08.400 --> 47:09.240]  Is this gonna be in?
[47:09.240 --> 47:10.160]  We give a lot of love.
[47:10.160 --> 47:11.600]  It's in the mountains, isn't it?
[47:11.600 --> 47:12.600]  It's in Denver now.
[47:12.600 --> 47:13.440]  Oh, okay.
[47:13.440 --> 47:15.800]  Or it's in an undisclosed location.
[47:15.800 --> 47:17.720]  Yeah, necessarily.
[47:17.720 --> 47:19.280]  Yeah.
[47:19.320 --> 47:21.400]  A lot of us were all prima donnas
[47:21.400 --> 47:24.320]  and didn't wanna go dab in the fucking woods
[47:24.320 --> 47:26.840]  because it's just hard to plug in your email out there.
[47:26.840 --> 47:28.880]  I like to take showers.
[47:28.880 --> 47:31.600]  I'm not trying to like stank for three days.
[47:31.600 --> 47:34.640]  We went camping and had an email with us.
[47:34.640 --> 47:37.040]  I owe a big shout outs to Turpex and Hunt
[47:37.040 --> 47:38.720]  from the Grimy Gatsby.
[47:38.720 --> 47:39.680]  Turpy Slurpy, boys.
[47:39.680 --> 47:41.120]  Turpy Slurpy.
[47:41.120 --> 47:42.080]  Turpy Slurpy.
[47:42.080 --> 47:42.920]  Turpy Slurpy.
[47:42.920 --> 47:43.760]  They know what's up, bro.
[47:43.760 --> 47:44.920]  That's some code word right there.
[47:44.920 --> 47:46.680]  That's a code word for something.
[47:46.680 --> 47:47.800]  Turpy Slurpy.
[47:48.760 --> 47:50.000]  What you know about that shit?
[47:50.000 --> 47:50.840]  Exactly, see?
[47:50.840 --> 47:51.680]  Turpy Slurpy.
[47:51.680 --> 47:53.680]  Man, this dome is stuck on this rig like a bitch.
[47:53.680 --> 47:56.200]  We're gonna have to do a dab on this other rig here.
[47:56.200 --> 47:57.560]  Hey guys, I appreciate you listening to us
[47:57.560 --> 47:58.640]  just ramble for a couple of minutes.
[47:58.640 --> 47:59.800]  It doesn't sound like we got much left
[47:59.800 --> 48:02.200]  on this little chatty part of the show.
[48:02.200 --> 48:05.040]  I wanna thank these guys for showing up once again.
[48:05.040 --> 48:06.560]  People really like having you guys on the show.
[48:06.560 --> 48:08.160]  I get a lot of listens when you guys show up,
[48:08.160 --> 48:10.240]  when you shout me out on your social media.
[48:10.240 --> 48:11.600]  So thanks for doing that.
[48:12.680 --> 48:13.960]  You guys got anybody you wanna shout out
[48:13.960 --> 48:15.880]  before we wrap this little section up?
[48:16.880 --> 48:18.720]  He went silent.
[48:18.720 --> 48:20.680]  How about to shout out to Hanky B.
[48:20.680 --> 48:21.840]  Yeah, shout out to Hanky B.
[48:21.840 --> 48:24.120]  We all owe a shout out to Hanky B, the homie.
[48:24.120 --> 48:26.040]  The boss, the chief, the champ.
[48:26.040 --> 48:28.560]  OG, but he's young OG.
[48:28.560 --> 48:29.400]  Young OG.
[48:29.400 --> 48:30.920]  Whatever.
[48:30.920 --> 48:32.880]  Showing that age does not fucking matter.
[48:32.880 --> 48:33.720]  No, no.
[48:33.720 --> 48:34.560]  Yeah.
[48:34.560 --> 48:35.400]  Hustle harder.
[48:35.400 --> 48:36.760]  Hustle every day.
[48:36.760 --> 48:38.040]  All right guys, we're gonna take a couple
[48:38.040 --> 48:40.400]  of Jerry Garcia-sized dabs here.
[48:40.400 --> 48:41.240]  Thanks for listening to us.
[48:41.240 --> 48:42.080]  If you have any questions,
[48:42.080 --> 48:44.320]  because I know we kind of went over that quickly.
[48:44.800 --> 48:46.800]  We're all dabbed out and we all have ADD here
[48:46.800 --> 48:48.840]  and we just wanted to hang out with each other a little bit.
[48:48.840 --> 48:50.680]  So if you have any questions, you know how to do it.
[48:50.680 --> 48:52.320]  Email me, tweet me, I'll say all that stuff.
[48:52.320 --> 48:53.640]  I'm gonna be back in just a couple of minutes
[48:53.640 --> 48:54.480]  to wrap up the show.
[48:54.480 --> 48:56.080]  Enjoy a little bit of music here
[48:56.080 --> 48:57.360]  and we're gonna get down.
[48:58.240 --> 49:00.520]  I'll leave the mics on so you can hear his dab for a minute.

[49:30.840 --> 49:32.160]  auto flower seeds.
[49:32.160 --> 49:34.160]  I want to give a huge shout out to Jesse and Spence
[49:34.160 --> 49:36.600]  for coming and taking time out of their day to be on the podcast.

[49:44.600 --> 49:45.920]  So Garden of Weeden.
[49:45.920 --> 49:49.080]  Also, big shout out to everybody from the Garden of Weeden.

[49:50.720 --> 49:51.560]  there's a lot of them.
[49:51.560 --> 49:53.160]  Much love to all those guys.
[49:53.160 --> 49:55.160]  Big shout out to Sorak and Nana also.
[49:56.120 --> 49:57.880]  So now that the show's over, please go to iTunes.
[49:57.880 --> 50:00.240]  Go to the iTunes store, search for iGrow Culture.
[50:00.240 --> 50:02.320]  Find the review section, give us a five-star rating.
[50:02.320 --> 50:03.600]  After that, type in a little comment,

[50:26.800 --> 50:28.040]  I don't even know what I have planned yet.
[50:28.040 --> 50:29.040]  It's gonna be that exciting.
[50:29.040 --> 50:30.920]  I usually start planning the show around Wednesday,
[50:30.920 --> 50:33.760]  so put the show out on a Monday, plan it on Wednesday.
[50:33.760 --> 50:34.920]  It works well for me.
[50:34.920 --> 50:36.960]  Got about a week to put it together.
[50:37.800 --> 50:38.680]  I'm sure there will be some sort of giveaway
[50:38.680 --> 50:40.440]  to the loyal listeners.
[50:40.440 --> 50:42.160]  So much respect to everybody that's listened.
