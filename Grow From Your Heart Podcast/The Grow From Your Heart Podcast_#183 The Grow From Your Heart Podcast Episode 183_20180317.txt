[00:16.960 --> 00:19.460]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.460 --> 00:21.360]  It's time for episode number 183
[00:21.360 --> 00:23.300]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.300 --> 00:24.800]  You're a source for cannabis news,
[00:24.800 --> 00:26.740]  education and conversation.
[00:26.740 --> 00:27.800]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:27.800 --> 00:29.040]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.040 --> 00:31.340]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.340 --> 00:32.600]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:32.600 --> 00:34.040]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.040 --> 00:35.880]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.880 --> 00:38.740]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:38.740 --> 00:40.580]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.580 --> 00:42.480]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:42.480 --> 00:44.680]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:44.680 --> 00:46.320]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.320 --> 00:48.720]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.720 --> 00:50.360]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot
[00:50.360 --> 00:52.520]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:54.220 --> 00:56.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is joining me again.
[00:56.400 --> 00:57.520]  Welcome back to the show, bro.
[00:57.520 --> 00:58.500]  Thanks man.
[00:58.500 --> 00:59.720]  Thanks for joining me.
[00:59.720 --> 01:00.560]  How's life going brother?
[01:00.560 --> 01:02.100]  It's so busy right now.
[01:02.100 --> 01:03.860]  I could tell, it was kind of a challenge
[01:03.860 --> 01:06.500]  getting you over here and getting a time.
[01:06.500 --> 01:08.240]  Our schedules even line up right now
[01:08.240 --> 01:09.480]  and it's still a challenge.
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.800]  It lines up and still does not line up.
[01:10.800 --> 01:12.280]  I'm just glad we were able to do it.
[01:12.280 --> 01:13.180]  Yeah man, welcome to the show.
[01:13.180 --> 01:14.380]  It's good to see you again.
[01:14.380 --> 01:15.340]  Good to hang out and take some dabs with you.
[01:15.400 --> 01:16.960]  It's been a minute but yeah,
[01:16.960 --> 01:18.660]  I had a nice little sesh before the show.
[01:18.660 --> 01:20.500]  So yeah, enjoy folks.
[01:20.500 --> 01:22.000]  Speaking of sesh before the show,
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.900]  big shout out to the Barefoot Grower.
[01:23.900 --> 01:26.880]  I grew some cactus cooler flowers
[01:26.880 --> 01:29.280]  and I had the Barefoot Grower do the extraction for me
[01:29.280 --> 01:31.480]  and everybody that has dabbed this shatter
[01:31.480 --> 01:33.720]  has been like, holy shit, that's delicious.
[01:33.720 --> 01:35.020]  We had a little sesh tonight.
[01:35.020 --> 01:37.480]  The Lindsay the Traveling Stoner was here.
[01:37.480 --> 01:39.360]  Excuse the throat clearing you guys,
[01:39.360 --> 01:41.080]  that's because of the little sesh we had.
[01:41.080 --> 01:42.260]  Lindsay the Traveling Stoner was here.
[01:42.260 --> 01:43.900]  Bobo Blaster Co. was here.
[01:43.900 --> 01:45.220]  Of course, Miss Jenny was here.
[01:46.040 --> 01:47.480]  Mike and I were here dabbing out.
[01:47.480 --> 01:48.980]  Everybody was loving the cactus cooler shatter.
[01:48.980 --> 01:50.440]  It's super delicious.
[01:50.440 --> 01:51.280]  Good job, bro.
[01:51.280 --> 01:54.020]  Good job, we all approve.
[01:54.020 --> 01:55.260]  Since we're doing shout outs,
[01:55.260 --> 01:58.060]  let's do a big shout out to my friend at Handmade Apparel.
[01:58.060 --> 01:59.980]  Handmade Apparel, if you guys need shirts,
[01:59.980 --> 02:02.000]  hoodies, hat pins, stickers,
[02:02.000 --> 02:04.660]  if you need any type of custom high quality printing,
[02:04.660 --> 02:06.640]  I completely recommend and highly endorse
[02:06.640 --> 02:08.300]  my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:08.300 --> 02:11.100]  Check them out at handmadeapparel.biz.
[02:11.100 --> 02:13.600]  Mike's rocking his Grow Up From Your Heart podcast hoodie
[02:13.600 --> 02:15.020]  and looking super fucking stylish tonight.
[02:15.820 --> 02:16.660]  Are you staying warm, bro?
[02:16.660 --> 02:17.620]  I am, these things are nice.
[02:17.620 --> 02:18.700]  Mike went to smoke outside
[02:18.700 --> 02:20.420]  and he told me it's 20 degrees outside.
[02:20.420 --> 02:22.780]  It's, yeah, it's ridiculously cold again.
[02:22.780 --> 02:24.180]  We had a nice little heat wave
[02:24.180 --> 02:26.660]  and it spoiled ourselves for two days
[02:26.660 --> 02:27.980]  and now it's back to 20.
[02:27.980 --> 02:29.260]  I'm glad I don't smoke cigarettes.
[02:29.260 --> 02:30.540]  It sounds miserable out there.
[02:30.540 --> 02:31.500]  Yeah, it's not fun.
[02:31.500 --> 02:33.700]  All right, so shout out to our friends at Handmade Apparel.
[02:33.700 --> 02:34.660]  You guys, make sure you support them,
[02:34.660 --> 02:37.060]  handmadeapparel.biz.
[02:37.060 --> 02:38.780]  Thanks for keeping me warm and stylish, guys.
[02:38.780 --> 02:39.860]  Speaking of shout outs, dude,
[02:39.860 --> 02:42.300]  we got a huge shout out from a podcast
[02:42.300 --> 02:44.100]  called The Dude Grows Show.
[02:44.220 --> 02:45.060]  Yeah, guys.
[02:45.060 --> 02:47.020]  The Dude Grows Podcast.
[02:47.020 --> 02:48.060]  Somebody tagged me on Twitter.
[02:48.060 --> 02:49.740]  I listened to that podcast anyway.
[02:49.740 --> 02:51.380]  I hadn't quite gotten to that episode,
[02:51.380 --> 02:52.380]  but somebody on Twitter was like,
[02:52.380 --> 02:54.020]  dude, you should check out The Dude Grows Show
[02:54.020 --> 02:55.580]  because they give you a huge shout out.
[02:55.580 --> 02:56.740]  And they really did.
[02:56.740 --> 02:58.340]  Great shout out, huge endorsement.
[02:58.340 --> 02:59.700]  So we're gonna return the favor.
[02:59.700 --> 03:01.860]  You guys, make sure you check out The Dude Grows Show.
[03:01.860 --> 03:03.660]  Great podcast about cannabis.
[03:03.660 --> 03:05.660]  I like it, I endorse it, and I enjoy it.
[03:05.660 --> 03:06.540]  They say good shit.
[03:06.540 --> 03:08.700]  I don't disagree with them, so go check them out.
[03:08.700 --> 03:11.100]  I've liked every episode I've listened to so far,
[03:11.100 --> 03:13.340]  so definitely endorsement from me as well.
[03:13.380 --> 03:14.940]  I thought it was funny that they checked you
[03:14.940 --> 03:16.740]  on being called White Mike.
[03:16.740 --> 03:18.940]  You can't give yourself a nickname, folks.
[03:18.940 --> 03:20.300]  That was not my own doing.
[03:20.300 --> 03:22.340]  Yeah, I invented calling you White Mike.
[03:22.340 --> 03:23.780]  You're my white guy friend.
[03:23.780 --> 03:26.620]  It was one of the, I was trying to think up
[03:26.620 --> 03:29.980]  the full story this week when I heard the shout out.
[03:31.220 --> 03:32.940]  Wasn't it the first night we went to record,
[03:32.940 --> 03:34.100]  it just sort of fell out of your head
[03:34.100 --> 03:35.740]  as something to introduce me as?
[03:35.740 --> 03:37.580]  I've always thought of you as like,
[03:37.580 --> 03:40.460]  if you're in the car and I'm gonna do something stupid,
[03:40.460 --> 03:41.500]  you're always the one that goes,
[03:42.340 --> 03:44.020]  you shouldn't do that, you shouldn't do that.
[03:44.020 --> 03:46.420]  And so you're like the white guy.
[03:46.420 --> 03:48.420]  He's super white, he's a good kid.
[03:48.420 --> 03:50.660]  Fuck it, he's not gonna let you break the rules.
[03:50.660 --> 03:51.900]  Yeah, so you just became White Mike.
[03:51.900 --> 03:53.380]  You're like my law friend.
[03:53.380 --> 03:54.220]  You know all my-
[03:54.220 --> 03:55.060]  It's not that I won't let you,
[03:55.060 --> 03:58.460]  it's just I like to remind you exactly what-
[03:58.460 --> 04:01.260]  Yes, what I'm getting into before I get myself into it.
[04:01.260 --> 04:03.340]  Yeah, that one's a misdemeanor and I approve.
[04:03.340 --> 04:05.660]  That one's a felony and I'm gonna go stand over here
[04:05.660 --> 04:07.660]  and act like I don't know you for 12 minutes.
[04:07.660 --> 04:09.660]  Hey guys, I'm playing with knobs on the podcast.
[04:09.660 --> 04:11.860]  I cleaned up the recording area
[04:11.860 --> 04:13.580]  and apparently I bumped some knobs
[04:13.580 --> 04:15.020]  somewhere on the recording equipment.
[04:15.020 --> 04:16.180]  So at some points it sounds like shit
[04:16.180 --> 04:17.620]  at the very beginning there, I apologize.
[04:17.620 --> 04:19.380]  I think I've got it dialed in now.
[04:19.380 --> 04:23.220]  And if I sounded distracted, that was why I do apologize.
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.780]  That intro was real clean
[04:24.780 --> 04:27.500]  and I know that you spent the entire time staring
[04:27.500 --> 04:30.540]  at the readouts looking for whatever was causing that issue
[04:30.540 --> 04:31.540]  when we first ran through.
[04:31.540 --> 04:32.460]  You know, everything looks good now,
[04:32.460 --> 04:33.300]  except for the volume.
[04:33.300 --> 04:34.660]  We had a volume dip a second ago,
[04:34.660 --> 04:36.140]  but I think we're leveled out.
[04:36.140 --> 04:38.220]  Nobody wants to hear about our fucking tech issues.
[04:38.220 --> 04:39.180]  Thank you for listening, you guys.
[04:39.700 --> 04:40.540]  I appreciate you for joining me.
[04:40.540 --> 04:41.700]  I hope we've got everything worked out.
[04:41.700 --> 04:43.660]  Just know that we work really hard
[04:43.660 --> 04:46.340]  or Jeff works really hard to make sure the show sounds good.
[04:46.340 --> 04:48.820]  And Mike gives very strong words of encouragement.
[04:48.820 --> 04:52.020]  All right, so shout out to our friends at the Dude Grow Show.
[04:52.020 --> 04:55.020]  It was great hearing that they enjoy the podcast.
[04:55.020 --> 04:57.180]  It was funny hearing them make fun of white Mike.
[04:57.180 --> 04:58.660]  White Mike did not give himself a name.
[04:58.660 --> 04:59.500]  That was my doing.
[04:59.500 --> 05:01.340]  That's a comment I've gotten several times
[05:01.340 --> 05:02.260]  and I always chuckle.
[05:02.260 --> 05:03.820]  It's like, you can't give yourself a nickname.
[05:03.820 --> 05:05.580]  I had no say in this happening.
[05:05.580 --> 05:08.740]  But if you meet white Mike, you'll go, oh.
[05:09.700 --> 05:10.980]  Yeah, yeah.
[05:10.980 --> 05:12.540]  Also, I wanna give a shout out to everybody
[05:12.540 --> 05:14.380]  who listened to the old episodes.
[05:14.380 --> 05:17.460]  I posted episode number 180, I don't remember.
[05:17.460 --> 05:18.380]  I think it's 181.
[05:18.380 --> 05:19.940]  I don't remember how the pattern goes.
[05:19.940 --> 05:21.940]  I think it's 182, 181.
[05:21.940 --> 05:23.780]  Let's see, it's gotta be 182.
[05:23.780 --> 05:26.580]  Is actually a repost of old episodes.
[05:26.580 --> 05:28.700]  It's episodes one through three.
[05:28.700 --> 05:30.100]  And then after this episode,
[05:30.100 --> 05:32.900]  I'm going to post episodes four through six.
[05:32.900 --> 05:34.340]  And as long as I can keep up,
[05:34.340 --> 05:36.300]  you guys, my schedule is looking ridiculous.
[05:36.300 --> 05:37.580]  I work a lot of hours.
[05:37.580 --> 05:38.660]  I have my own garden.
[05:39.460 --> 05:40.300]  I have my own life.
[05:40.300 --> 05:41.700]  And I try to keep a lot of podcast stuff coming.
[05:41.700 --> 05:43.780]  But as long as I can keep it in my schedule
[05:43.780 --> 05:45.180]  and keep my life balanced,
[05:45.180 --> 05:49.380]  I plan to put out chunks of large episodes every week
[05:49.380 --> 05:51.220]  as often as I can keep up.
[05:51.220 --> 05:53.700]  Also, somebody mentioned that I should
[05:53.700 --> 05:56.060]  put the old episodes on YouTube.
[05:56.060 --> 05:57.740]  I was secretly doing that already.
[05:57.740 --> 05:58.740]  I didn't wanna announce it
[05:58.740 --> 06:00.740]  until I had a lot of them up there.
[06:00.740 --> 06:03.220]  Episodes one through 19 are on the old
[06:03.220 --> 06:05.340]  I Grow Culture YouTube channel.
[06:05.340 --> 06:06.940]  And then I have created a brand new
[06:06.980 --> 06:09.180]  Grow From The Heart podcast YouTube channel
[06:09.180 --> 06:11.220]  that's got two full videos on it.
[06:11.220 --> 06:12.980]  And I shared the first 19.
[06:12.980 --> 06:14.660]  So episodes one through 21
[06:14.660 --> 06:17.300]  are available on YouTube right now.
[06:17.300 --> 06:18.220]  The good thing about YouTube,
[06:18.220 --> 06:19.060]  they don't limit you.
[06:19.060 --> 06:21.300]  You can post as much stuff as you can put up.
[06:21.300 --> 06:23.660]  The only problem is it takes me a long time to make a video.
[06:23.660 --> 06:26.940]  I'm kind of OCD and I like my stuff almost perfect.
[06:26.940 --> 06:28.860]  So it takes me a minute.
[06:28.860 --> 06:30.060]  If you are patient with me,
[06:30.060 --> 06:31.620]  I'll try to catch up every video.
[06:31.620 --> 06:33.500]  We'll have every video for every podcast.
[06:33.500 --> 06:35.220]  It may just be one long.
[06:35.220 --> 06:36.340]  The whole video just may be
[06:36.740 --> 06:38.420]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo for the entire thing,
[06:38.420 --> 06:40.620]  but it will be available on YouTube,
[06:40.620 --> 06:42.540]  which is what people seem to want
[06:42.540 --> 06:43.740]  and what they're asking for.
[06:43.740 --> 06:45.540]  So I've found ways to bring you the old content
[06:45.540 --> 06:46.980]  so that you can listen to it.
[06:46.980 --> 06:49.660]  I cannot wait to hear your comments, you guys.
[06:49.660 --> 06:50.500]  Tweet me.
[06:50.500 --> 06:51.660]  I'm looking forward to going back
[06:51.660 --> 06:54.100]  and listening to the stuff from the very beginning.
[06:54.100 --> 06:56.220]  I vaguely remember being here for it,
[06:56.220 --> 07:00.100]  but I'm looking forward to hearing it fresh.
[07:00.100 --> 07:02.620]  I couldn't listen to episode number one.
[07:02.620 --> 07:03.700]  I was just embarrassed.
[07:03.700 --> 07:06.220]  I was like, oh, I was such a poor podcaster.
[07:07.060 --> 07:07.900]  I had heart and I was really into it,
[07:07.900 --> 07:09.180]  but I embarrassed myself.
[07:09.180 --> 07:10.060]  I cut people off.
[07:10.060 --> 07:12.340]  I interrupted so much at the beginning.
[07:12.340 --> 07:14.260]  And it always used to bug me
[07:14.260 --> 07:16.180]  when Conan O'Brien would have guests on,
[07:16.180 --> 07:17.780]  he would interrupt the shit out of them,
[07:17.780 --> 07:18.820]  and that bothered me.
[07:18.820 --> 07:20.260]  And it bothered me to see myself,
[07:20.260 --> 07:22.380]  hear myself doing it in a podcast.
[07:22.380 --> 07:25.260]  I just feel like I've come such a long way.
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.780]  The show's come a long way.
[07:26.780 --> 07:28.220]  I mean, in every aspect, too,
[07:28.220 --> 07:30.900]  from the equipment pile that we're working with
[07:30.900 --> 07:34.380]  to the format of the show, everything.
[07:34.380 --> 07:35.220]  You couldn't tell today.
[07:35.220 --> 07:36.580]  This equipment is frustrating me,
[07:36.580 --> 07:38.460]  but I think we're recording a good podcast.
[07:38.460 --> 07:39.940]  So I'm gonna get over that.
[07:39.940 --> 07:41.100]  Big shout out to everybody that listened
[07:41.100 --> 07:42.260]  to episodes one through three.
[07:42.260 --> 07:43.740]  Continue listening,
[07:43.740 --> 07:45.740]  because four through six are coming.
[07:45.740 --> 07:47.860]  I can't guarantee it'll be three episodes all the time,
[07:47.860 --> 07:50.060]  but it will be approximately three hours.
[07:50.060 --> 07:51.660]  My recording software doesn't like
[07:51.660 --> 07:52.980]  longer than three hour files,
[07:52.980 --> 07:54.980]  and I really don't think your downloads
[07:54.980 --> 07:57.340]  are gonna be appreciating more than three hours.
[07:57.340 --> 07:59.300]  Joe Rogan cuts out at three hours for a reason.
[07:59.300 --> 08:01.500]  Somewhere there's a girl from your heart fan
[08:01.500 --> 08:04.340]  with dial up that's just slamming their face
[08:04.460 --> 08:05.300]  into the desk.
[08:05.300 --> 08:07.260]  Why's it gotta be a three hour file?
[08:07.260 --> 08:08.900]  Their data plan is fucking blowing up.
[08:08.900 --> 08:09.740]  They're mad at me.
[08:09.740 --> 08:11.580]  Like, I can't download this till next month.
[08:11.580 --> 08:15.520]  All right, so this episode is not going to be
[08:15.520 --> 08:18.320]  one of those grow episodes like I've been doing recently.
[08:18.320 --> 08:19.160]  Mike is here.
[08:19.160 --> 08:19.980]  We're gonna hang out.
[08:19.980 --> 08:20.820]  This is gonna be a more casual episode.
[08:20.820 --> 08:23.540]  We do have a couple of topics that we're going to hit,
[08:23.540 --> 08:26.380]  but this isn't going to be a garden packed episode
[08:26.380 --> 08:28.260]  like I've done by myself.
[08:28.260 --> 08:29.180]  Thanks for listening to those.
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.540]  I hope you're learning a lot.
[08:30.540 --> 08:33.420]  Dude, the last two or three episodes were killer.
[08:33.860 --> 08:36.660]  I like to listen to the show when I'm out running around.
[08:36.660 --> 08:39.340]  And as soon as those episodes start,
[08:39.340 --> 08:40.780]  I know the feel of it at the beginning,
[08:40.780 --> 08:43.060]  and I'm like, shit, okay, so when I get home,
[08:43.060 --> 08:45.780]  I'm gonna get a notebook and just start it fresh
[08:45.780 --> 08:47.780]  and make sure I get the notes down.
[08:47.780 --> 08:49.140]  Shout out to all the people that take notes.
[08:49.140 --> 08:50.860]  I love knowing that there are people out there
[08:50.860 --> 08:51.700]  taking notes.
[08:51.700 --> 08:53.500]  So much good info packed into such a short amount of time.
[08:53.500 --> 08:56.220]  And I'm trying not to overwhelm the listener
[08:56.220 --> 08:57.500]  by doing too many topics,
[08:57.500 --> 08:59.780]  but I'm also trying not to make it useless
[08:59.780 --> 09:02.100]  to even do a show by only having so much info.
[09:02.100 --> 09:03.140]  And my throat burns out.
[09:03.860 --> 09:05.340]  It's hard to talk by yourself for like 40 minutes.
[09:05.340 --> 09:08.500]  Yep, going solid like that, the time goes slow.
[09:08.500 --> 09:11.700]  Yeah, one thing I do wanna mention though,
[09:11.700 --> 09:14.780]  I've been talking a lot about evergreen pyrethrums,
[09:14.780 --> 09:17.580]  pyrethrum concentrate, or I'm not sure exactly
[09:17.580 --> 09:20.780]  even how it should be mentioned, but evergreen pyrethrum.
[09:20.780 --> 09:24.220]  That's like 5% pyrethrum concentrate or something like that.
[09:24.220 --> 09:26.660]  I have been using it to battle fungus gnats.
[09:26.660 --> 09:30.300]  I mixed 10 milliliters per gallon in my regular feed.
[09:30.300 --> 09:31.900]  Like I mixed up my nutrients like normal,
[09:31.900 --> 09:33.820]  and then I just threw 10 mils per gallon in there,
[09:33.820 --> 09:36.740]  gave it a nice mix, adjusted the pH,
[09:36.740 --> 09:38.780]  and then I watered all the plants with that.
[09:38.780 --> 09:41.340]  And I don't see any flying bugs anymore.
[09:41.340 --> 09:44.900]  I also mixed up nine mils per gallon
[09:44.900 --> 09:48.140]  and applied it as a foliar spray to all of my vegging plants
[09:48.140 --> 09:50.320]  and I have not seen a flying insect.
[09:50.320 --> 09:52.420]  I actually, right after I sprayed,
[09:52.420 --> 09:55.100]  I hung up fresh yellow sticky traps
[09:55.100 --> 09:58.200]  and there are not bugs on those fresh yellow sticky traps.
[09:58.200 --> 09:59.620]  Everything has gone away.
[09:59.620 --> 10:02.700]  So I think the evergreen as a soil drench
[10:02.700 --> 10:05.460]  and as a spray combo worked very well.
[10:05.460 --> 10:08.020]  And I intend to hit it again with the soil drench
[10:08.020 --> 10:10.300]  in approximately four or five days
[10:10.300 --> 10:11.900]  to make sure any eggs in there disappear as well.
[10:11.900 --> 10:14.780]  That's what I was waiting for is did it get the eggs?
[10:14.780 --> 10:17.860]  I know so many people who have ranted and raved
[10:17.860 --> 10:21.580]  about their bug fight success on Monday, Tuesday,
[10:21.580 --> 10:25.380]  and Wednesday only to weep on Thursday when it's back.
[10:25.380 --> 10:27.140]  Yeah, I know how to be persistent
[10:27.140 --> 10:29.300]  and I set the product right where I'll see it.
[10:29.980 --> 10:30.820]  That's where I'm like, oh yeah,
[10:30.820 --> 10:31.880]  you got to use that the next time.
[10:31.880 --> 10:34.260]  So I think it will work.
[10:34.260 --> 10:37.200]  Actually, I mixed up some push from veg bloom
[10:37.200 --> 10:40.580]  and some evergreen and sprayed them at the same time.
[10:40.580 --> 10:43.100]  I never thought of spraying multiple products at one time
[10:43.100 --> 10:47.700]  until I met a guy who I've seen him spray four and five
[10:47.700 --> 10:51.160]  or six different products as a foliar feed all at one time.
[10:51.160 --> 10:52.260]  They'll do, I've seen him do it.
[10:52.260 --> 10:54.820]  I'm not saying how I feel about this,
[10:54.820 --> 10:55.860]  but this is what I've seen him do.
[10:55.860 --> 10:59.280]  He did Azimax, he did Smite, he did Banish.
[11:00.120 --> 11:02.080]  And he also did a little bit of Grandivo,
[11:02.080 --> 11:03.620]  I think he put in there.
[11:03.620 --> 11:05.680]  And then he did the, oh no, he didn't do Grandivo.
[11:05.680 --> 11:08.280]  He did evergreen pyrethrum,
[11:08.280 --> 11:11.120]  and then he did push to balance everything out.
[11:11.120 --> 11:12.480]  And he just sprays that shit on the plants
[11:12.480 --> 11:15.400]  and his plants look wonderful and it keeps the pests away.
[11:15.400 --> 11:18.240]  Do your research before you start mixing stuff, folks.
[11:18.240 --> 11:19.700]  Yes, yes, that's why I was trying to say
[11:19.700 --> 11:23.200]  that I can't agree or say what I wouldn't do,
[11:23.200 --> 11:25.480]  but I've seen it done and it works well for this guy.
[11:25.480 --> 11:28.000]  So the evergreen as a soil drench worked marvelously
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.160]  from what I can see so far.
[11:29.160 --> 11:30.960]  It was kind of what I was trying to get at you guys.
[11:30.960 --> 11:33.640]  I like it, anything that works, share it with the world.
[11:33.640 --> 11:35.840]  Yes, yes, especially since I've been preaching about it
[11:35.840 --> 11:36.880]  on my own podcast.
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.320]  I was like, well, I'm gonna buy this and try it
[11:38.320 --> 11:41.400]  because I feel like every time the seasons change
[11:41.400 --> 11:43.440]  here in Colorado, and we're in Pueblo, Colorado.
[11:43.440 --> 11:44.280]  This is kind of-
[11:44.280 --> 11:46.800]  The seasons change every 40 minutes here right now.
[11:46.800 --> 11:48.520]  Yeah, honestly, it's kind of weird.
[11:48.520 --> 11:51.120]  You have to take, I could have worn shorts today.
[11:51.120 --> 11:53.360]  I was out running errands, I could have worn shorts,
[11:53.360 --> 11:55.040]  but then in the evening it was hoodie weather.
[11:55.040 --> 11:56.680]  And then tonight everyone's fucking cold.
[11:56.680 --> 11:58.320]  It's 20 degrees outside and tomorrow
[11:58.320 --> 12:00.280]  it's probably gonna be pretty nice.
[12:00.280 --> 12:02.680]  So somewhere in the high 60s, low 70s tomorrow,
[12:02.680 --> 12:04.120]  which for us is like super nice.
[12:04.120 --> 12:06.840]  It's like a t-shirt, shorts, skate shoes,
[12:06.840 --> 12:07.680]  huff socks.
[12:07.680 --> 12:09.280]  Yeah, when it hits 63, 64,
[12:09.280 --> 12:11.080]  you start seeing them shorts and flip flops here.
[12:11.080 --> 12:13.680]  Yeah, and when it gets to 70, the skate parks are filled,
[12:13.680 --> 12:15.560]  people are out on their bikes hustling.
[12:15.560 --> 12:17.320]  Yeah, all right, I'm just making sure
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.160]  everything's still going here.
[12:18.160 --> 12:19.560]  I don't have the podcast screen up
[12:19.560 --> 12:21.680]  and we're still recording, everything is successful.
[12:21.680 --> 12:22.520]  Beautiful.
[12:22.520 --> 12:23.920]  Yes, all right.
[12:23.920 --> 12:25.760]  Here's something we have not done in quite a while.
[12:25.800 --> 12:26.840]  And I feel like it is time.
[12:26.840 --> 12:28.880]  We're going to read some iTunes comments.
[12:28.880 --> 12:31.280]  I love reading the iTunes comments.
[12:31.280 --> 12:33.720]  Mike is signaling that he wants a dab.
[12:33.720 --> 12:34.560]  Here, I'm going to put-
[12:34.560 --> 12:36.160]  I've got some hash if you've got a rig in the mail.
[12:36.160 --> 12:37.720]  Oh, I've got all of the above.
[12:37.720 --> 12:39.880]  Here's a, you get a line, I'll get a poll.
[12:39.880 --> 12:40.720]  Here's a dab.
[12:41.920 --> 12:42.760]  Feel free to use-
[12:42.760 --> 12:45.240]  I just want a dab, I don't want a line or a poll.
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.080]  Oh man.
[12:46.080 --> 12:47.160]  I got the wrong line.
[12:47.160 --> 12:50.440]  I just got weird quickly.
[12:50.440 --> 12:52.440]  Quickly, Mike's gonna take a dab.
[12:52.440 --> 12:54.680]  As soon as he starts coughing, I'll turn off his microphone,
[12:54.680 --> 12:56.920]  but I'll leave it on until then.
[12:56.920 --> 12:59.440]  I just know that I appreciate your comments, folks.
[12:59.440 --> 13:01.480]  And I love seeing them go up.
[13:01.480 --> 13:04.120]  On iTunes, you guys, if you want to leave a comment,
[13:04.120 --> 13:06.880]  you can go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[13:06.880 --> 13:08.440]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[13:08.440 --> 13:09.360]  You got to scroll to the bottom.
[13:09.360 --> 13:12.000]  You'll see the podcast logo, click on there,
[13:12.000 --> 13:14.480]  then go to the ratings and reviews tabs.
[13:14.480 --> 13:16.800]  And you can click on how many stars
[13:16.800 --> 13:18.040]  you'd like to give me so far.
[13:18.040 --> 13:20.120]  This is what I'm trying to brag about.
[13:20.120 --> 13:23.160]  I've got 44 listeners who have given me
[13:23.160 --> 13:25.040]  all five star ratings.
[13:25.040 --> 13:26.380]  So you click on the amount of stars
[13:26.380 --> 13:28.840]  that you feel I deserve, and then type in a little review.
[13:28.840 --> 13:32.560]  And in the future, I will read your comment on the podcast
[13:32.560 --> 13:35.280]  like I'm about to do right now from some folks.
[13:35.280 --> 13:37.640]  I'm gonna go in a chronological order.
[13:37.640 --> 13:38.880]  Where was I?
[13:38.880 --> 13:40.440]  Oh yeah, turn off Mike's mic, huh?
[13:40.440 --> 13:41.600]  Here you go.
[13:41.600 --> 13:42.440]  There you go.
[13:42.440 --> 13:43.660]  You can still hear you coughing through my mic,
[13:43.660 --> 13:45.400]  so everyone will know you're alive.
[13:46.480 --> 13:48.880]  He's got his arms out like Jesus, like it's gonna help.
[13:48.880 --> 13:49.880]  He's purple.
[13:50.720 --> 13:53.040]  Mike, tell us what you just dabbed, try to cough.
[13:53.040 --> 13:55.120]  That was some of the cactus cooler shatter
[13:55.120 --> 13:58.720]  and all beautiful body high with that dab.
[13:58.720 --> 13:59.920]  That's what the arms were about.
[13:59.920 --> 14:00.760]  Nice, nice.
[14:00.760 --> 14:02.120]  Oh, you got it together, bro.
[14:02.120 --> 14:04.360]  All right, turning you off again, turning you off again.
[14:04.360 --> 14:05.440]  I can hold it for.
[14:07.320 --> 14:08.400]  We're gonna let Mike cough.
[14:08.400 --> 14:09.440]  All right, you guys, we're gonna get serious.
[14:09.440 --> 14:11.080]  I'm gonna read a comment.
[14:11.080 --> 14:14.560]  The comment I want to start with, I need to scroll to it.
[14:14.560 --> 14:16.280]  Most recent, where was it?
[14:16.280 --> 14:17.100]  It's in here.
[14:17.100 --> 14:18.460]  All right, this one comes from a listener
[14:18.500 --> 14:20.980]  who calls themselves JJOliveOil08.
[14:20.980 --> 14:22.980]  Honestly, I feel like I may have read this comment before,
[14:22.980 --> 14:24.900]  but I'm not certain, so we're gonna start with this one.
[14:24.900 --> 14:27.520]  It says, Jeff is a very positive guy
[14:27.520 --> 14:29.380]  with so many informative things to say
[14:29.380 --> 14:32.020]  about growing and the rest of the industry.
[14:32.940 --> 14:33.860]  That's perfect, thank you.
[14:33.860 --> 14:35.180]  I try to be a positive dude.
[14:35.180 --> 14:36.120]  I try to stay positive.
[14:36.120 --> 14:38.500]  I did an episode called Stay Positive.
[14:38.500 --> 14:40.540]  I try to be just an upbeat sort of dude.
[14:40.540 --> 14:42.220]  So that means a lot to me that you noticed that
[14:42.220 --> 14:44.660]  and that you'd say I'm informative.
[14:44.660 --> 14:45.740]  Hey, that's a positive thing.
[14:45.740 --> 14:47.420]  And about growing and the rest of the industry.
[14:47.420 --> 14:49.340]  I think that bringing my insight
[14:49.340 --> 14:52.720]  to the cannabis industry to you guys is completely valuable.
[14:52.720 --> 14:53.560]  Mike is bailing.
[14:53.560 --> 14:55.340]  Mike is just getting the fuck out of here.
[14:55.340 --> 14:56.700]  He said he'll be back in a second.
[14:56.700 --> 14:58.300]  So it's a solo podcast suddenly.
[14:59.740 --> 15:01.820]  Our next comment, oh, JJOliveOil.
[15:01.820 --> 15:02.820]  Thank you for the comment.
[15:02.820 --> 15:04.420]  I completely appreciate that.
[15:04.420 --> 15:07.580]  Keep listening, I'm glad you find me informative.
[15:07.580 --> 15:11.140]  The next comment comes from SamS37.
[15:11.140 --> 15:13.760]  And this one says, thanks, Rasta Jeff.
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.300]  And the comment says, I've learned a ton
[15:15.300 --> 15:16.580]  from Jeff and the awesome guests.
[15:16.580 --> 15:18.260]  Thanks for sharing your knowledge with the community
[15:18.260 --> 15:20.660]  and helping make the world a better place.
[15:20.660 --> 15:22.780]  Keep fighting the good fight.
[15:22.780 --> 15:24.040]  Sam, you're very welcome.
[15:24.040 --> 15:25.240]  I'm here to fight the good fight
[15:25.240 --> 15:27.180]  and I hope I'm rallying a bunch of other folks
[15:27.180 --> 15:28.740]  to fight the good fight with us.
[15:28.740 --> 15:30.780]  And I promise I will keep sharing the knowledge
[15:30.780 --> 15:31.740]  with the community.
[15:31.740 --> 15:33.500]  I promise you that's what I'm here for.
[15:33.500 --> 15:34.340]  I appreciate it.
[15:34.340 --> 15:35.160]  Thanks for the comment.
[15:35.160 --> 15:36.500]  I'm glad you're learning from me.
[15:36.500 --> 15:38.000]  Mike, you're back, you better?
[15:39.460 --> 15:41.060]  Mostly, mostly better.
[15:41.060 --> 15:42.720]  Some beverages will keep me going.
[15:42.720 --> 15:45.220]  All right, welcome back to the show, brother man.
[15:45.260 --> 15:47.260]  Always good to be here.
[15:47.260 --> 15:48.860]  So the next comment comes from a person
[15:48.860 --> 15:50.820]  who calls himself Terpene Station.
[15:50.820 --> 15:52.700]  I wonder if that's a play on Terrapin Station.
[15:52.700 --> 15:55.140]  Big shout out if it is, super cool.
[15:55.140 --> 15:57.780]  Anyway, the headline of the comment is, love the show.
[15:57.780 --> 15:59.860]  And the comment goes like this, love the show.
[15:59.860 --> 16:02.200]  Wish it was longer and or more often.
[16:03.340 --> 16:05.300]  Oh, I hear that so much.
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.900]  It's hard, it's hard to do more.
[16:06.900 --> 16:09.260]  I tried really hard to win the lotto this week, guys,
[16:09.260 --> 16:11.220]  so that we could do this full time, but.
[16:11.220 --> 16:13.660]  I keep getting these emails from these Nigerian princes
[16:13.700 --> 16:15.940]  that say they're gonna give me millions of dollars,
[16:15.940 --> 16:17.340]  but they never seem to do it.
[16:17.340 --> 16:18.180]  I know.
[16:18.180 --> 16:19.020]  I know, I would take so much
[16:19.020 --> 16:20.460]  of that Nigerian diamond money.
[16:20.460 --> 16:21.700]  All right.
[16:21.700 --> 16:23.300]  We're down to help, guys.
[16:23.300 --> 16:26.660]  He also goes on to say, they also go on to say,
[16:26.660 --> 16:28.140]  keep it up, Jeff, you do a great job
[16:28.140 --> 16:30.380]  and make working in the garden that much better.
[16:30.380 --> 16:33.820]  Ever think of a live stream or a YouTube channel?
[16:33.820 --> 16:36.380]  The YouTube channel I mentioned earlier, that it's coming.
[16:36.380 --> 16:38.220]  There are videos up there, I gotta make more.
[16:38.220 --> 16:39.400]  It takes a lot of time.
[16:40.460 --> 16:43.620]  I can either do more episodes or I could get them on YouTube.
[16:44.460 --> 16:45.300]  It's kind of a toss up.
[16:45.300 --> 16:46.120]  I try to balance my time that way.
[16:46.120 --> 16:49.420]  Also live streams, sometimes you can catch me on Periscope.
[16:49.420 --> 16:51.300]  Sometimes you can catch me on Facebook Live.
[16:51.300 --> 16:53.460]  I don't do a lot of the Instagram Live,
[16:53.460 --> 16:56.520]  but I do some Periscope and I do some Facebook Live stuff.
[16:56.520 --> 16:58.740]  So that's the only way I really do live streams.
[16:58.740 --> 17:01.020]  And honestly, I haven't had a ton of time
[17:01.020 --> 17:04.220]  for that stuff either, but I'm glad you love the show.
[17:04.220 --> 17:06.140]  And I've been putting out really long episodes.
[17:06.140 --> 17:07.620]  There's a three hour episode posted.
[17:07.620 --> 17:09.860]  So maybe that'll help you crush some time in the garden.
[17:09.860 --> 17:11.100]  Hey, keep listening while you're in the garden.
[17:11.100 --> 17:13.180]  I hope the plants aren't sick of my voice.
[17:14.020 --> 17:16.260]  Thanks for the comment, Terpene Station.
[17:16.260 --> 17:17.860]  I appreciate that.
[17:17.860 --> 17:20.020]  All right, we've got one last comment.
[17:20.020 --> 17:22.580]  This one says a friend in the garden.
[17:22.580 --> 17:24.420]  It's from Jubilant Organics.
[17:24.420 --> 17:26.500]  And they said, I found this awesome podcast
[17:26.500 --> 17:29.460]  just a few weeks ago and I haven't stopped listening since.
[17:29.460 --> 17:31.900]  I feel like Jeff is a good friend in the garden now.
[17:31.900 --> 17:33.800]  Even controversial topics are explained
[17:33.800 --> 17:36.180]  in intelligent manners and simply encourage listeners
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.800]  to inform themselves and make their own decisions.
[17:38.800 --> 17:41.460]  Jeff picks great guests and keeps the tone personal,
[17:41.460 --> 17:43.020]  allowing for great conversation
[17:43.380 --> 17:45.460]  around keeping the cannabis community informed,
[17:45.460 --> 17:48.720]  entertained and feeling good every Monday.
[17:49.620 --> 17:51.540]  Dude, I'm glad you enjoy the show every Monday.
[17:51.540 --> 17:53.160]  That's why I put it out on Mondays.
[17:53.160 --> 17:56.100]  Even when I'm on the episode that's about to come out,
[17:56.100 --> 17:59.600]  it's still the highlight of my Monday almost every week.
[17:59.600 --> 18:01.340]  That's sadly awesome.
[18:01.340 --> 18:02.180]  You know what I mean?
[18:02.180 --> 18:04.000]  Like it's awesome that I'm the highlight of your week,
[18:04.000 --> 18:05.420]  but it's sad that I'm the highlight of your week.
[18:05.420 --> 18:06.260]  Not the whole week, highlight of the week.
[18:06.260 --> 18:07.300]  Of your Monday.
[18:07.300 --> 18:09.020]  Well, yeah, that's still a little sad.
[18:09.020 --> 18:10.140]  Mondays suck.
[18:10.140 --> 18:10.980]  Yeah, Monday.
[18:10.980 --> 18:12.300]  Well, that's why I put the show out exactly
[18:12.420 --> 18:14.540]  because Mondays suck for a lot of people.
[18:14.540 --> 18:18.180]  It's nice to have something good that's unique to Mondays.
[18:18.180 --> 18:20.260]  Yeah, at least I get to listen to this podcast
[18:20.260 --> 18:21.460]  and learn a little bit about ganja
[18:21.460 --> 18:23.780]  and hang out with my friend Rasta Jeff.
[18:23.780 --> 18:25.000]  Jubilant, I'm glad that you feel
[18:25.000 --> 18:26.540]  like you were friends already,
[18:26.540 --> 18:29.340]  especially since you just found us a few weeks ago.
[18:29.340 --> 18:30.180]  That's awesome.
[18:30.180 --> 18:31.620]  If you ever have questions,
[18:31.620 --> 18:32.820]  make sure you send me some messages
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.460]  because I'd love to answer those questions
[18:34.460 --> 18:35.620]  about your garden.
[18:35.620 --> 18:37.800]  I'm not sure if you've ever sent me a message,
[18:37.800 --> 18:39.260]  but I would love to help you out in the garden
[18:39.260 --> 18:40.980]  if you have any troubles.
[18:41.100 --> 18:43.580]  Dude, thanks for appreciating the guest, White Mike.
[18:43.580 --> 18:45.540]  They said right here, Jeff picks great guests.
[18:45.540 --> 18:47.220]  You're probably one of the most common guests,
[18:47.220 --> 18:48.660]  so they gotta be talking about you.
[18:48.660 --> 18:49.500]  Thanks, man.
[18:49.500 --> 18:52.500]  Yeah, Mike got a huge shout out on Twitter, wasn't it?
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.380]  I sent you a screenshot of it.
[18:54.380 --> 18:55.500]  It said, shout out to White Mike.
[18:55.500 --> 18:57.060]  Yeah, so shout out to everybody
[18:57.060 --> 18:58.460]  that enjoys White Mike also.
[18:58.460 --> 18:59.300]  I appreciate that.
[18:59.300 --> 19:00.540]  We appreciate it, folks.
[19:01.700 --> 19:03.260]  If you wanna say hi, you can hit me up.
[19:03.260 --> 19:05.360]  It's at NemoPunk15 on Twitter,
[19:05.360 --> 19:06.900]  or you can find me on Facebook
[19:06.900 --> 19:09.380]  at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[19:09.380 --> 19:10.460]  Make sure you check him out, you guys.
[19:10.980 --> 19:12.180]  I support Mike's Facebook page there.
[19:12.180 --> 19:15.820]  He posts a lot of great, informative cannabis stuff.
[19:15.820 --> 19:18.820]  It's an easy way to stay up to date on what's going on.
[19:18.820 --> 19:19.940]  All right, I wanna thank everybody
[19:19.940 --> 19:22.180]  who sent me an iTunes comment.
[19:22.180 --> 19:24.220]  Jubilant Organics, Terpene Station,
[19:24.220 --> 19:28.660]  Sam S. 37, and JJ Olive Oil 08.
[19:28.660 --> 19:29.500]  I appreciate it.
[19:29.500 --> 19:30.320]  Thanks for all the comments.
[19:30.320 --> 19:31.660]  Also, thanks to everybody who has sent me a comment.
[19:31.660 --> 19:34.140]  In the past, I've got 44 ratings.
[19:34.140 --> 19:36.040]  I've got 37 comments.
[19:36.040 --> 19:39.020]  Everybody seems satisfied so far.
[19:39.020 --> 19:39.860]  Thank you, guys.
[19:40.860 --> 19:43.620]  All right, Mike, we've been talking for a whole lot of time.
[19:43.620 --> 19:45.340]  You think it's time to start talking
[19:45.340 --> 19:48.100]  about the main topic of our podcast for this evening?
[19:48.100 --> 19:49.500]  We should start itching to it.
[19:49.500 --> 19:51.660]  My head just tried to tangent us real hard.
[19:51.660 --> 19:52.500]  Well, what's on your mind?
[19:52.500 --> 19:53.340]  What do you wanna tangent about?
[19:53.340 --> 19:57.140]  I was just chuckling about the different levels
[19:57.140 --> 19:58.820]  for each social media.
[19:59.700 --> 20:01.700]  Just the other day, I heard you randomly mention
[20:01.700 --> 20:04.320]  that one photo you put up had 500 likes,
[20:04.320 --> 20:06.860]  and you were specifying it in a time frame.
[20:06.860 --> 20:07.940]  Oh, yeah, okay.
[20:08.660 --> 20:10.060]  Now we're talking about iTunes,
[20:10.060 --> 20:11.940]  totally different platform.
[20:11.940 --> 20:15.300]  Very different scale of good versus bad.
[20:16.380 --> 20:19.260]  There are so many different things on iTunes.
[20:20.580 --> 20:23.860]  I run two different social media platforms at home
[20:23.860 --> 20:26.100]  for non-cannabis-related stuff.
[20:27.300 --> 20:30.320]  The info that I'm able to see from my demographics
[20:30.320 --> 20:33.480]  and stuff each week on the two are not relatable,
[20:33.480 --> 20:36.420]  but that's something I have to remind myself of every week.
[20:36.580 --> 20:40.300]  Like 10 here is better than 100 over here.
[20:40.300 --> 20:42.500]  So you completely weren't joking when you said
[20:42.500 --> 20:44.380]  that you just wanted to go all tangeny, right?
[20:44.380 --> 20:49.100]  No, I was fucking serious, and you said do it, so I did it.
[20:49.100 --> 20:50.620]  You saw the dab I just took.
[20:50.620 --> 20:52.020]  You saw me turn purple.
[20:52.020 --> 20:54.980]  Right now, exactly what I'm doing is preparing myself a dab
[20:54.980 --> 20:57.020]  because I was like, I wanna be where Mike's fucking head
[20:57.020 --> 20:59.540]  is right now because whatever happened to him looks fun.
[20:59.540 --> 21:01.700]  If you say, do you wanna go buy some fireworks tonight?
[21:01.700 --> 21:03.460]  I'll go, sure, let's get in the car.
[21:03.460 --> 21:04.740]  I'm just up for anything right now.
[21:04.740 --> 21:06.340]  That dab was delicious.
[21:07.260 --> 21:08.100]  It just put me in a great mood.
[21:08.100 --> 21:09.980]  Shout out to Will for doing a great job
[21:09.980 --> 21:10.820]  with this extraction.
[21:10.820 --> 21:11.780]  Good work, brother, man.
[21:11.780 --> 21:13.020]  Well, obviously it's working.
[21:13.020 --> 21:15.340]  Yeah, this stuff tastes so delicious.
[21:15.340 --> 21:19.140]  The only way I can describe it is there is pineapple
[21:19.140 --> 21:23.540]  and there's orange, but then there's this flavor
[21:23.540 --> 21:24.740]  that sticks on your face.
[21:24.740 --> 21:25.580]  It won't go away.
[21:25.580 --> 21:27.700]  It stays on the roof of your mouth,
[21:27.700 --> 21:29.020]  and it leaves a coating.
[21:29.020 --> 21:30.500]  It's like a candy coating.
[21:30.500 --> 21:31.380]  You're doing it right now.
[21:31.380 --> 21:33.260]  You're making the, you're just licking the top of your mouth
[21:33.260 --> 21:34.300]  like, oh, it tastes so good.
[21:34.300 --> 21:35.940]  I just finished a Jolly Rancher,
[21:35.940 --> 21:38.420]  and I wish I had another one that flavor feeling.
[21:38.420 --> 21:40.580]  Or kind of when you get a little tiny piece of it
[21:40.580 --> 21:42.380]  stuck in one tooth and you just lick that tooth
[21:42.380 --> 21:43.660]  and you get a hint of the flavor
[21:43.660 --> 21:44.780]  for like the next half hour.
[21:44.780 --> 21:47.820]  Like, oh, look, there's a little pineapple, yeah.
[21:47.820 --> 21:50.780]  This has such a bold flavor, and it tastes,
[21:50.780 --> 21:53.860]  most dabs and most cannabis consumption
[21:53.860 --> 21:56.300]  and smoking leaves my mouth dry.
[21:56.300 --> 21:59.820]  I feel like my mouth is juicy after I smoke these dabs.
[21:59.820 --> 22:02.660]  It's like moist and I don't know, I'm not thirsty.
[22:02.780 --> 22:05.580]  Yeah, my mouth didn't need hydration
[22:05.580 --> 22:07.020]  after the dab, my throat did.
[22:07.020 --> 22:08.580]  I roasted myself.
[22:08.580 --> 22:10.860]  I think all of the listeners heard the roast.
[22:10.860 --> 22:11.940]  Yep, sorry.
[22:11.940 --> 22:13.420]  If you're a long time listener,
[22:13.420 --> 22:15.180]  you're used to me coughing like a,
[22:16.180 --> 22:18.300]  I don't even want to do an analogy.
[22:18.300 --> 22:19.140]  Like a person that coughs a lot.
[22:19.140 --> 22:21.820]  Coughing like an old chain smoker.
[22:21.820 --> 22:22.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:24.260 --> 22:25.100]  And if you know Mike,
[22:25.100 --> 22:26.380]  and if you've dabbed at the table with him,
[22:26.380 --> 22:27.820]  you've seen him turn multiple colors
[22:27.820 --> 22:29.500]  and look at me like, bro, is that okay?
[22:29.500 --> 22:32.180]  Yep, and Chris, there's a 90% chance
[22:32.700 --> 22:34.140]  you're listening like, it wasn't you earlier.
[22:34.140 --> 22:37.020]  It was just how I react to dabs.
[22:37.020 --> 22:39.700]  He was like, oh no, I killed him.
[22:39.700 --> 22:41.140]  I kept trying to say I'm fine,
[22:41.140 --> 22:43.860]  but I couldn't do what I did just a minute ago on the show.
[22:43.860 --> 22:45.300]  I couldn't make words.
[22:45.300 --> 22:48.180]  Yeah, Bobo Blastroco gave him a pretty good sized dab earlier
[22:48.180 --> 22:51.180]  and Mike turned purple and pink and pink and purple
[22:51.180 --> 22:53.020]  and red, white and blue.
[22:53.020 --> 22:53.860]  Pretty good.
[22:53.860 --> 22:55.940]  It's fun to do the whole Crayola box after a dab.
[22:55.940 --> 22:56.780]  The whole Crayola box.
[22:56.780 --> 22:57.980]  So I'm going to take a dab.
[22:57.980 --> 23:00.740]  Bro, do you want to step up to the plate
[23:00.740 --> 23:04.500]  and explain to our listeners the recent news
[23:04.500 --> 23:07.660]  that dickhead Sean Spicer announced?
[23:07.660 --> 23:10.780]  Sure, so as those,
[23:10.780 --> 23:13.180]  if you're in the cannabis community, even a little bit,
[23:13.180 --> 23:16.260]  you're already at least mildly aware
[23:16.260 --> 23:19.540]  that the White House is looking at increased enforcement
[23:19.540 --> 23:22.660]  on recreational marijuana coast to coast.
[23:23.860 --> 23:27.700]  That was the big announcement from Thursday's press briefing
[23:27.700 --> 23:28.860]  or one of several.
[23:29.700 --> 23:33.940]  And we've got an article specific to that story pulled up
[23:33.940 --> 23:36.540]  with a couple of good accurate quotes.
[23:36.540 --> 23:37.580]  Oh, don't tell him that you're lying.
[23:37.580 --> 23:38.420]  Cause I'm dabbing.
[23:38.420 --> 23:39.380]  I ain't got to shut this up.
[23:39.380 --> 23:40.980]  I do, I have to, I have to get to it.
[23:40.980 --> 23:41.820]  He knows where it is,
[23:41.820 --> 23:44.220]  but he's too high to make the keys work just yet.
[23:44.220 --> 23:45.660]  Cause he's doing the rainbow thing
[23:45.660 --> 23:46.500]  that I just did right now.
[23:46.500 --> 23:48.300]  I feel like I did swimming motions.
[23:48.300 --> 23:50.860]  I was like trying to swim a little bit like, oh wow.
[23:50.860 --> 23:53.220]  He does the colors, just not the coughing.
[23:53.220 --> 23:54.900]  Yeah, I could feel how red I am.
[23:56.260 --> 23:58.540]  You and the Rasta flag behind you match right now.
[23:59.220 --> 24:01.900]  And my red sleeves on my t-shirt, but in my defense, Mike,
[24:01.900 --> 24:03.820]  I think you take like a 0.1 dab.
[24:03.820 --> 24:04.780]  My dabs are tiny.
[24:04.780 --> 24:06.820]  It's definitely the tobacco people.
[24:06.820 --> 24:08.260]  If you don't smoke cigarettes now,
[24:08.260 --> 24:10.380]  do never start for any reason.
[24:10.380 --> 24:12.680]  And if you do smoke tobacco, just try to quit.
[24:13.700 --> 24:14.540]  That's gross.
[24:14.540 --> 24:15.740]  And if you're a pretty girl and you smoke tobacco,
[24:15.740 --> 24:16.920]  just quit even sooner.
[24:18.460 --> 24:20.060]  I agree with everything.
[24:20.060 --> 24:20.900]  That's unattractive.
[24:20.900 --> 24:21.940]  All right.
[24:21.940 --> 24:25.860]  So basically just to kind of lead you into this,
[24:26.700 --> 24:30.620]  this wasn't something that like the White House announced
[24:30.620 --> 24:33.500]  as a new big policy decision.
[24:33.500 --> 24:36.700]  This all started because a reporter from,
[24:36.700 --> 24:40.140]  I believe Arkansas asked a question that was,
[24:40.140 --> 24:41.700]  and I'm paraphrasing,
[24:41.700 --> 24:44.880]  our state legalized medical marijuana last November.
[24:44.880 --> 24:47.740]  What are y'all going to do about that, if anything?
[24:47.740 --> 24:50.500]  Oh, so this was not something they came out and announced.
[24:50.500 --> 24:51.620]  Yeah.
[24:51.620 --> 24:53.260]  Somebody asked and he replied.
[24:53.260 --> 24:54.100]  Yep.
[24:54.100 --> 24:54.920]  Okay, see, I didn't even know that.
[24:54.920 --> 24:56.040]  I'm glad you told me that.
[24:56.040 --> 24:58.800]  Because none of the news has really reported that fact.
[25:00.160 --> 25:03.320]  I want you to read the article before I do my thing on this,
[25:03.320 --> 25:06.880]  but that was what happened and what's been reported
[25:06.880 --> 25:10.660]  in the cognitive dissonance there
[25:10.660 --> 25:12.400]  is why I called you last night
[25:12.400 --> 25:13.560]  and was like, we need to podcast.
[25:13.560 --> 25:14.840]  Right, well, as soon as I heard this,
[25:14.840 --> 25:16.120]  I was like, I need to get Mike over here.
[25:16.120 --> 25:17.040]  We need to record.
[25:17.040 --> 25:17.880]  Right.
[25:17.880 --> 25:19.400]  I'm going to go look at the graph on GarageBand
[25:19.400 --> 25:20.560]  and make sure we're recording correctly
[25:20.560 --> 25:21.400]  because I'm paranoid.
[25:21.400 --> 25:22.280]  Make sure everything's smooth.
[25:22.280 --> 25:23.520]  We're going, and now we're going to start
[25:23.520 --> 25:24.400]  reading this article.
[25:24.400 --> 25:26.960]  Beautiful, I'll do my best not to cough through the whole.
[25:26.960 --> 25:29.000]  I'm going to cough because the dab I took was tremendous.
[25:29.000 --> 25:30.680]  I should not have done that.
[25:30.680 --> 25:32.880]  Shout out to dabs, big up to dabs.
[25:32.880 --> 25:34.520]  Shout out to syrupy beverages
[25:34.520 --> 25:36.200]  that help you not cough after dabs.
[25:36.200 --> 25:38.720]  Caffeine might be my favorite drug.
[25:38.720 --> 25:40.520]  So this article comes from the Cannabis
[25:40.520 --> 25:42.480]  and the headline is Trump administration
[25:42.480 --> 25:45.520]  puts recreational marijuana in crosshairs.
[25:45.520 --> 25:48.440]  It's written by Alicia Wallace from the Cannabis staff.
[25:48.440 --> 25:50.360]  We're only going to read a portion of the article
[25:50.360 --> 25:52.240]  and it starts like this.
[25:52.240 --> 25:54.200]  States where recreational marijuana is legal
[25:54.960 --> 25:56.120]  will be subject to, and in quotes,
[25:56.120 --> 25:59.240]  it says greater enforcement under the Trump administration.
[25:59.240 --> 26:01.960]  White house spokesman, Sean Spicer said Thursday,
[26:01.960 --> 26:04.240]  but watchers of the multi-billion dollar weed industry
[26:04.240 --> 26:06.400]  are waiting to see whether Spicer's statements
[26:06.400 --> 26:08.320]  during his daily briefing actually yield
[26:08.320 --> 26:10.440]  a real shift in enforcement policy.
[26:11.520 --> 26:13.400]  That's pretty much the gist of the story.
[26:13.400 --> 26:15.040]  He said that and nothing has happened.
[26:15.040 --> 26:16.760]  No clue has been given.
[26:16.760 --> 26:17.960]  No raids have been done.
[26:17.960 --> 26:20.560]  No, not, no, not to be tightened.
[26:20.560 --> 26:24.600]  The only thing that happened is Sean Spicer.
[26:24.600 --> 26:26.520]  If you don't know who that is,
[26:26.520 --> 26:28.840]  it's who Melissa McCarthy's been just destroying
[26:28.840 --> 26:30.080]  on Saturday Night Live.
[26:31.120 --> 26:32.960]  He's the mouthpiece for the white house
[26:32.960 --> 26:34.400]  is what his job boils down to.
[26:34.400 --> 26:36.880]  I think press secretary or something is his official title.
[26:36.880 --> 26:38.400]  So he just speaks basically.
[26:38.400 --> 26:40.520]  He's like the white house.
[26:40.520 --> 26:42.920]  If the press could, would pass through them 24 seven
[26:42.920 --> 26:44.720]  with questions about everything.
[26:44.720 --> 26:47.360]  His job is to hold a meeting every day
[26:47.360 --> 26:49.720]  where they get to do that for an hour.
[26:49.720 --> 26:51.000]  That sounds fun.
[26:51.000 --> 26:51.880]  It's a nightmare.
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.880]  The people that take this job age so quickly.
[26:57.560 --> 27:00.120]  You should sit up there and bullshit people for an hour.
[27:00.120 --> 27:02.080]  Well, yes and no.
[27:02.080 --> 27:03.200]  I would troll people.
[27:03.200 --> 27:06.040]  We've got a team of genius monkeys working on that
[27:06.040 --> 27:07.240]  as we speak, sir.
[27:07.240 --> 27:08.280]  And our next question,
[27:08.280 --> 27:09.880]  I would just troll the shit out of people.
[27:09.880 --> 27:12.200]  Why you don't work for the white house.
[27:13.640 --> 27:15.760]  Yeah, and the whole Babylon thing.
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.720]  But he was asked this question this week
[27:20.720 --> 27:23.360]  and what you just read was basically
[27:23.360 --> 27:27.880]  the first part of his answer, which means nothing.
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.040]  I mean, you should pull the video for yourself
[27:31.040 --> 27:34.440]  and watch the whole five or seven minute clip on marijuana.
[27:34.440 --> 27:36.760]  It's like from 20 minutes to 28 minutes or something.
[27:36.760 --> 27:39.580]  I think I'm just punching.
[27:40.920 --> 27:42.880]  What was the date yesterday?
[27:42.880 --> 27:45.240]  If you type in Sean Spicer and marijuana.
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.160]  Yeah, Sean Spicer and marijuana will come up.
[27:47.160 --> 27:52.160]  I think it was like the 23rd of February.
[27:52.240 --> 27:54.120]  It'll come up where you can watch the whole video
[27:54.120 --> 27:54.960]  on YouTube.
[27:54.960 --> 27:56.520]  There's a bunch of different links to it.
[27:56.520 --> 27:58.840]  And it's worth the watch in its entirety
[27:58.840 --> 28:00.320]  because there's some other really bizarre
[28:00.320 --> 28:01.640]  political statements he makes
[28:01.640 --> 28:03.480]  during this particular press briefing.
[28:03.480 --> 28:05.440]  So that's where I am right now in the article.
[28:05.440 --> 28:08.440]  The statement that he said that bothered most people is
[28:08.440 --> 28:10.520]  there's a big difference between medical marijuana
[28:10.520 --> 28:11.960]  and recreational marijuana.
[28:11.960 --> 28:13.440]  And I think when you see something
[28:13.440 --> 28:16.160]  like the opioid addiction crisis blossoming
[28:16.160 --> 28:18.160]  in so many states around this country,
[28:18.160 --> 28:21.120]  the last thing we should be doing is encouraging people.
[28:21.960 --> 28:25.080]  There's a lot of information in that sentence.
[28:25.080 --> 28:29.320]  A, as far as he's saying right now,
[28:29.320 --> 28:30.720]  kind of off the top of his head
[28:30.720 --> 28:33.400]  in the response to a question he was just asked,
[28:33.400 --> 28:36.440]  the White House views recreational and medical marijuana
[28:36.440 --> 28:37.880]  as very different things.
[28:37.880 --> 28:39.400]  Yes.
[28:39.400 --> 28:44.400]  And two, marijuana and the opioid epidemic
[28:45.320 --> 28:48.800]  that we're suffering coast to coast are somehow related.
[28:48.800 --> 28:51.000]  And that second piece is where
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.120]  the entire marijuana community was like, uh, no.
[28:54.120 --> 28:55.440]  Right.
[28:55.440 --> 28:59.160]  The gateway fear has been debunked a million times.
[28:59.160 --> 29:01.280]  I consume cannabis every single day
[29:01.280 --> 29:04.680]  to avoid taking pharmaceuticals.
[29:04.680 --> 29:07.640]  There are countless people across the country
[29:07.640 --> 29:09.280]  that share that exact same story.
[29:10.120 --> 29:11.760]  I know somebody who left another state
[29:11.760 --> 29:14.600]  and they came here to get away from pharmaceuticals.
[29:14.600 --> 29:15.840]  They smoke cannabis.
[29:15.840 --> 29:17.360]  They had an addiction.
[29:17.360 --> 29:19.160]  They do have a medical problem.
[29:19.160 --> 29:20.520]  That doctor gave them tons of,
[29:20.520 --> 29:22.000]  this is how it happens to most people, right?
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.240]  You get hurt.
[29:23.240 --> 29:26.240]  Every day talks to eight of these people.
[29:26.240 --> 29:27.080]  Yeah.
[29:27.080 --> 29:27.920]  You get injured.
[29:27.920 --> 29:29.080]  Doctor gives you pills.
[29:29.080 --> 29:29.920]  You need those pills.
[29:29.920 --> 29:30.800]  Now you're addicted to them.
[29:30.800 --> 29:32.720]  The doctor gets money for giving you those pills.
[29:32.720 --> 29:34.000]  Doctor keeps giving you pills.
[29:34.000 --> 29:35.200]  You feel good because you take them.
[29:35.200 --> 29:36.640]  You keep fucking taking them.
[29:36.640 --> 29:38.240]  You don't hurt anymore, but you don't know that
[29:38.240 --> 29:39.800]  because you love taking these pills.
[29:39.800 --> 29:41.800]  Eventually you're just trying to get more pills
[29:41.800 --> 29:42.640]  because when you don't take them,
[29:42.640 --> 29:44.400]  your body feels like shit.
[29:44.400 --> 29:46.240]  I know a guy that actually left another state
[29:46.240 --> 29:47.920]  and is here because he was in that cycle.
[29:47.920 --> 29:49.440]  And now all he does is smoke cannabis.
[29:49.440 --> 29:50.480]  He doesn't take any pills.
[29:50.480 --> 29:51.320]  He's like, I don't hurt.
[29:51.320 --> 29:52.160]  I thought I hurt.
[29:54.280 --> 29:55.400]  In our city of Pueblo,
[29:55.400 --> 29:58.960]  the main doctor that's sort of out publicly
[29:58.960 --> 30:02.000]  fighting the heroin epidemic,
[30:02.000 --> 30:04.760]  going to city council, giving them presentations,
[30:04.760 --> 30:07.000]  asking for funding for this or that program,
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.560]  he started a needle exchange program here.
[30:09.560 --> 30:11.960]  He basically said the first half of that.
[30:11.960 --> 30:14.080]  And when they said, where this epidemic,
[30:14.080 --> 30:15.600]  why is this happening?
[30:15.600 --> 30:18.040]  He said, for 15 years,
[30:18.040 --> 30:22.440]  we handed out opiates like they were Tic Tacs.
[30:22.440 --> 30:26.680]  And now an infinite number of people are mildly addicted
[30:26.680 --> 30:29.280]  or severely addicted to prescription painkillers.
[30:29.280 --> 30:30.400]  For the last 10 years,
[30:30.400 --> 30:32.480]  we've been kicking people off those pills
[30:32.480 --> 30:34.520]  and now they're turning to street heroin
[30:34.520 --> 30:35.880]  because they're addicted to opiates
[30:35.880 --> 30:36.720]  and can't get the opiates
[30:37.400 --> 30:39.200]  they were originally addicted to.
[30:39.200 --> 30:40.920]  And now they're overdosing on heroin
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.440]  because they don't have any idea how to dose it.
[30:43.440 --> 30:45.480]  And for the first time in their addiction,
[30:45.480 --> 30:49.960]  they're buying a drug that doesn't come in specific dosages.
[30:49.960 --> 30:53.920]  And so we're seeing overdoses like we did in the 70s.
[30:54.880 --> 30:59.760]  And in Colorado and the rest of the medical marijuana states,
[30:59.760 --> 31:02.760]  I don't know if the data's back on the rec states yet,
[31:03.600 --> 31:07.360]  opioid overdoses are down here compared to places
[31:07.360 --> 31:09.920]  that don't have liberalized marijuana laws.
[31:09.920 --> 31:13.440]  And it's that access to a different pain medication
[31:13.440 --> 31:16.360]  and a stepping stone drug to get you off
[31:16.360 --> 31:19.000]  of all of the pills that you're hooked on
[31:19.000 --> 31:21.720]  that's causing those reductions in deaths.
[31:21.720 --> 31:24.640]  And now we have the spokesman for the White House
[31:24.640 --> 31:29.640]  saying that marijuana use is causing the opioid epidemic.
[31:29.760 --> 31:32.720]  I mean, it's drastically against the research.
[31:33.560 --> 31:34.400]  He didn't directly say that.
[31:34.400 --> 31:37.040]  He just said that we don't need to be encouraging people
[31:37.040 --> 31:40.200]  with cannabis when we already have an opioid problem.
[31:40.200 --> 31:42.760]  Like the two somehow, if we're okay with,
[31:42.760 --> 31:44.000]  okay, you can smoke weed,
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.240]  but that also means you can do opiates.
[31:46.240 --> 31:48.080]  Like it's kind of what he's hinting at.
[31:48.080 --> 31:49.360]  And I don't think,
[31:49.360 --> 31:51.600]  none of the cannabis users want opiates really.
[31:51.600 --> 31:55.280]  And the thing that really caught my ears about that sentence
[31:55.280 --> 31:59.800]  is it's straight out of the anti-pot talking book
[31:59.800 --> 32:01.620]  or talking point playbook.
[32:01.620 --> 32:04.540]  You see Project Sam saying that over and over
[32:04.540 --> 32:05.500]  and over again.
[32:05.500 --> 32:06.820]  It's just re-formats.
[32:06.820 --> 32:09.260]  And with Jeff Sessions as the AG,
[32:09.260 --> 32:13.980]  that was really our indication or should have been anyway
[32:13.980 --> 32:15.980]  that this administration
[32:15.980 --> 32:18.880]  would at least not be cannabis friendly.
[32:18.880 --> 32:22.860]  Jeff Sessions is the highest cop in the country,
[32:22.860 --> 32:25.100]  is not a good thing for cannabis consumers.
[32:26.360 --> 32:29.500]  On the upside, they view medical and recreational marijuana
[32:29.500 --> 32:30.860]  as very different things.
[32:30.860 --> 32:32.900]  Right, so it sounds like if they do something,
[32:32.900 --> 32:35.340]  we're still gonna have medical marijuana.
[32:35.340 --> 32:37.080]  And if they do decide to act,
[32:37.080 --> 32:39.580]  they're only going to act on recreational marijuana.
[32:39.580 --> 32:41.500]  Well, there was a really bizarre,
[32:41.500 --> 32:44.220]  and this piece hasn't been widely reported.
[32:45.140 --> 32:49.540]  The next reporter asks a question that's totally unrelated
[32:49.540 --> 32:54.180]  and then pitches in a follow-up to the marijuana piece.
[32:54.180 --> 32:57.460]  And Sean Spicer elaborates and says,
[32:58.340 --> 33:00.220]  well, medical marijuana,
[33:01.260 --> 33:04.140]  there's a rule and it's called the Rohrabacher Amendment.
[33:04.140 --> 33:09.140]  And it was a rider to an appropriations bill in 2014.
[33:10.860 --> 33:15.860]  I believe that says the DOJ can't get funding to go after.
[33:17.100 --> 33:19.080]  I can't remember if it's people only
[33:19.080 --> 33:21.380]  or if it mentions businesses as well.
[33:21.380 --> 33:24.460]  But in practice, it's applied to businesses.
[33:24.460 --> 33:26.820]  You can't go after people
[33:26.820 --> 33:29.460]  abiding by state medical marijuana laws,
[33:29.460 --> 33:31.800]  but it's medical marijuana specific.
[33:31.800 --> 33:34.820]  And so in places like Colorado,
[33:34.820 --> 33:36.300]  where we have both a medical
[33:36.300 --> 33:38.500]  and a recreational marijuana system,
[33:38.500 --> 33:41.520]  rules, regulations, they're totally separate.
[33:41.520 --> 33:43.960]  We could see it in federal enforcement action
[33:43.960 --> 33:47.540]  where they threaten to come in and raid all the rec shops.
[33:47.540 --> 33:50.100]  But that was part of what our buddy Sean Spicer said here.
[33:50.100 --> 33:52.380]  He said, there is still a federal law
[33:52.380 --> 33:54.940]  that we need to abide by in terms of recreational marijuana
[33:54.940 --> 33:57.100]  and other drugs of that nature.
[33:57.100 --> 34:00.860]  And so right now there's no little special rule
[34:00.860 --> 34:03.740]  that says the DOJ can't get funding
[34:03.740 --> 34:07.500]  to screw with state's recreational marijuana laws.
[34:07.500 --> 34:10.580]  There is a bill right now that's set to go nowhere
[34:10.580 --> 34:12.620]  in Congress to do just that,
[34:12.620 --> 34:15.660]  to create the same rule, but say recreational.
[34:16.700 --> 34:19.380]  And so I'm urging everyone to call their senators
[34:19.380 --> 34:21.980]  and their house of representative members.
[34:22.540 --> 34:25.180]  It's really easy to look who that is up online
[34:25.180 --> 34:26.900]  and just email them and say,
[34:26.900 --> 34:28.780]  pretty please protect state's rights
[34:28.780 --> 34:31.620]  when it comes to medical and recreational marijuana.
[34:32.500 --> 34:35.620]  If you Google a couple of the words I just said,
[34:35.620 --> 34:37.860]  you'll be able to find the specific bill number.
[34:37.860 --> 34:40.580]  If you want to be an extra studious
[34:40.580 --> 34:43.760]  and say, please support bill blank, blank, blank, blank.
[34:43.760 --> 34:45.140]  I wish I had that number in front of me.
[34:45.140 --> 34:45.960]  I just don't.
[34:47.580 --> 34:50.380]  And really do an effective email,
[34:50.380 --> 34:53.320]  but please call and push.
[34:53.320 --> 34:55.140]  Cause that's how we stop this from becoming
[34:55.140 --> 34:57.820]  more than something a guy said in a press briefing.
[35:00.060 --> 35:02.800]  Because we don't really know what this means.
[35:02.800 --> 35:05.980]  The press on this, like the headline they give you.
[35:05.980 --> 35:08.020]  He didn't know he was going to be speaking on it.
[35:08.020 --> 35:09.660]  So he was just kind of talking out of his ass,
[35:09.660 --> 35:10.900]  it seems like.
[35:10.900 --> 35:12.220]  Well, yes and no.
[35:13.180 --> 35:16.940]  This is a topic that's too big for him
[35:16.940 --> 35:20.140]  and the president and a couple of other key people
[35:20.860 --> 35:23.540]  whose job it is to field questions regularly.
[35:23.540 --> 35:25.140]  They've definitely talked about it,
[35:25.140 --> 35:27.980]  at least in a broad general sense.
[35:27.980 --> 35:31.380]  And so it's not completely pulled out of his ass.
[35:31.380 --> 35:32.980]  I really wish it was.
[35:34.100 --> 35:37.020]  Because it's sort of in the vein
[35:37.020 --> 35:38.980]  of traditional Republican talking points
[35:38.980 --> 35:41.140]  when it comes to marijuana legalization.
[35:41.140 --> 35:43.740]  No, it's against federal law, you're bad, hippie.
[35:43.740 --> 35:46.260]  Like that's the general stance from the right on this
[35:46.260 --> 35:48.200]  until very, very recently.
[35:50.260 --> 35:53.300]  But this isn't a specific policy decision.
[35:53.300 --> 35:55.500]  This isn't the White House saying
[35:55.500 --> 35:57.700]  Trump signed an executive order
[35:57.700 --> 36:00.340]  or has asked Congress to write a law that,
[36:01.660 --> 36:03.380]  or has threatened to.
[36:03.380 --> 36:05.660]  It's just a response to a question.
[36:05.660 --> 36:07.420]  And unfortunately with this administration,
[36:07.420 --> 36:09.300]  we have no idea what the fuck that might mean.
[36:09.300 --> 36:12.220]  Yeah, and it's got a lot of the cannabis industry
[36:12.220 --> 36:13.060]  at the edge of their seat
[36:13.060 --> 36:14.980]  just waiting to see what the move is.
[36:14.980 --> 36:17.940]  The really bad side to what he said was
[36:18.940 --> 36:23.140]  that's gonna be up to the Department of Justice.
[36:23.140 --> 36:25.680]  And what that means is we kind of left that up
[36:25.680 --> 36:27.180]  to Jeff Sessions.
[36:27.180 --> 36:29.820]  And we know that he's an anti-marijuana,
[36:29.820 --> 36:31.300]  anti-drug crusader from way back.
[36:31.300 --> 36:32.980]  Good people don't smoke marijuana.
[36:32.980 --> 36:33.820]  Yep.
[36:35.100 --> 36:37.100]  There's some much more outlandish statements
[36:37.100 --> 36:39.300]  regarding marijuana that are attributed to him
[36:39.300 --> 36:41.340]  that I'm sure you'll see if you Google his name.
[36:41.340 --> 36:44.940]  But the good people don't smoke marijuana
[36:44.940 --> 36:47.260]  is a quote he's proud of.
[36:47.300 --> 36:48.980]  That he'll stand by.
[36:48.980 --> 36:51.220]  That he's happy to be the top cop in the land
[36:51.220 --> 36:54.500]  where 36 states are in conflict with federal law.
[36:54.500 --> 36:55.900]  Mike, you're not a good person.
[36:55.900 --> 36:58.020]  I know, I'm a terrible human being.
[36:58.020 --> 36:59.100]  I'm a bad person.
[36:59.100 --> 37:00.460]  I get accused of that a lot.
[37:00.460 --> 37:02.360]  Montel Williams is a bad person.
[37:02.360 --> 37:06.340]  There's, I mean, the crazy thing is,
[37:06.340 --> 37:09.980]  is there's an estimated 20 million
[37:09.980 --> 37:11.660]  American marijuana consumers.
[37:11.660 --> 37:14.100]  And that's people that smoke pot each year-ish.
[37:14.100 --> 37:14.940]  That admit it.
[37:14.940 --> 37:15.900]  That admit it.
[37:15.900 --> 37:17.980]  That when the federal government calls and says,
[37:17.980 --> 37:19.580]  hi, we're the federal government.
[37:19.580 --> 37:22.080]  We'd like to talk about your drug use.
[37:22.080 --> 37:23.860]  You go, sure.
[37:23.860 --> 37:26.300]  And then answer yes to I smoke marijuana.
[37:26.300 --> 37:27.920]  That's 20 million people.
[37:29.020 --> 37:31.020]  100 million in their lifetime.
[37:31.020 --> 37:33.060]  My guess is the number's probably close
[37:33.060 --> 37:35.980]  to like 45 million Americans smoke marijuana a year.
[37:35.980 --> 37:39.060]  But it's hard to gauge how many people
[37:39.060 --> 37:40.500]  answer that shit honestly.
[37:40.500 --> 37:41.340]  Right.
[37:41.340 --> 37:42.180]  It's like the first thing they teach you
[37:42.180 --> 37:44.060]  when you start studying research like this.
[37:44.060 --> 37:45.380]  They asked us that in high school too.
[37:45.900 --> 37:46.820]  They're like, how many drugs have you done?
[37:46.820 --> 37:48.220]  And I was like, zero.
[37:48.220 --> 37:49.780]  Fucking tripping when they asked me.
[37:49.780 --> 37:51.500]  Well, and then there's the other group of people
[37:51.500 --> 37:53.580]  that mark I shoot heroin every day
[37:53.580 --> 37:56.060]  when they've never seen cigarettes.
[37:56.060 --> 37:59.080]  Like both groups of people exist.
[38:00.100 --> 38:00.940]  Trolls.
[38:00.940 --> 38:03.300]  But just saying there's 20 million of us,
[38:03.300 --> 38:05.900]  we'll take the government's low ball number.
[38:05.900 --> 38:08.860]  There's 4 million NRA members.
[38:08.860 --> 38:11.940]  They get a say in every law that's passed in this country.
[38:11.940 --> 38:14.780]  They get a say in every single person
[38:15.180 --> 38:16.820]  that's elected in this country.
[38:16.820 --> 38:18.620]  There's 4 million of those people.
[38:19.580 --> 38:20.780]  And when I say those people,
[38:20.780 --> 38:22.820]  I'm not saying I'm not now or haven't been
[38:22.820 --> 38:24.340]  an NRA member in the past.
[38:24.340 --> 38:25.660]  I grew up in Colorado.
[38:25.660 --> 38:27.360]  I have a very conservative parent.
[38:28.980 --> 38:31.300]  But there's only 4 million of them.
[38:31.300 --> 38:33.500]  That's not very many people.
[38:33.500 --> 38:34.980]  That's less than the number of people
[38:34.980 --> 38:37.020]  that are in Colorado, period.
[38:37.020 --> 38:38.500]  Colorado doesn't get a say
[38:38.500 --> 38:40.700]  in who's elected senator in New York.
[38:41.900 --> 38:44.460]  I mean, it's a very small number of people.
[38:45.140 --> 38:47.220]  And there's two reasons they have power.
[38:47.220 --> 38:50.140]  It's because their members regularly send
[38:50.140 --> 38:52.680]  10, 20, $30 a year to the NRA.
[38:54.060 --> 38:55.200]  And their members vote.
[38:56.340 --> 38:57.500]  And that's fucking it.
[38:58.380 --> 38:59.460]  That's it.
[38:59.460 --> 39:02.540]  They don't have any other magical powers.
[39:02.540 --> 39:04.500]  They don't have a magic genie
[39:04.500 --> 39:06.640]  that helps them achieve their goals.
[39:07.500 --> 39:10.180]  They have 4 million people that contribute
[39:10.180 --> 39:12.980]  a small amount of money individually each year.
[39:12.980 --> 39:14.260]  And they all vote.
[39:15.220 --> 39:17.320]  Now, if the government's lowball number
[39:17.320 --> 39:19.900]  is 20 million American pot smokers,
[39:21.340 --> 39:25.620]  why are we the butt of every joke when it comes to politics?
[39:25.620 --> 39:28.100]  Why is marijuana still illegal in most states?
[39:28.100 --> 39:29.920]  Why is it still illegal federally?
[39:30.940 --> 39:33.020]  Because we won't contribute small amounts
[39:33.020 --> 39:34.500]  of money individually to places
[39:34.500 --> 39:36.140]  like the Marijuana Policy Project
[39:36.140 --> 39:39.100]  that actually fight for legalization nationally.
[39:39.100 --> 39:40.060]  And we don't vote.
[39:41.460 --> 39:43.980]  Or when we do vote, we don't vote unified.
[39:44.420 --> 39:45.380]  So we should all vote.
[39:45.380 --> 39:46.660]  That's the obvious part.
[39:48.160 --> 39:50.500]  So you said the Marijuana Policy, say it again?
[39:50.500 --> 39:51.940]  The Marijuana Policy Project.
[39:51.940 --> 39:53.780]  Marijuana Policy Project.
[39:53.780 --> 39:55.460]  If you had to choose one organization
[39:55.460 --> 39:57.300]  other than the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[39:57.300 --> 40:00.180]  to send funds to support the legalization of cannabis,
[40:00.180 --> 40:01.380]  where would you recommend?
[40:01.380 --> 40:02.380]  There's a couple.
[40:02.380 --> 40:06.480]  And if you actually wanna contribute financially,
[40:06.480 --> 40:09.580]  you should take more than listening to this podcast
[40:09.580 --> 40:13.220]  or whoever I say to figure out who you wanna donate to.
[40:13.220 --> 40:15.080]  So I'm not even gonna throw out a name.
[40:15.080 --> 40:17.420]  I threw out Marijuana Policy Project off the cuff
[40:17.420 --> 40:19.700]  just because they do a lot of policy work.
[40:19.700 --> 40:20.540]  All right.
[40:21.980 --> 40:23.000]  But-
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.280]  So should they start locally
[40:24.280 --> 40:27.200]  or should they go with the big national group?
[40:27.200 --> 40:30.940]  It depends where you're at and what your situation is.
[40:30.940 --> 40:33.380]  If you live in a full prohibition state,
[40:33.380 --> 40:35.300]  by all means, start locally.
[40:35.300 --> 40:37.620]  So throw some fuel at the fire on your side.
[40:37.620 --> 40:40.080]  Put some ammo in the gun there
[40:40.080 --> 40:41.940]  by putting some financial contributions
[40:41.940 --> 40:43.740]  into your side of the battle.
[40:43.740 --> 40:44.940]  That's it exactly.
[40:44.940 --> 40:47.780]  The only time marijuana consumers get together
[40:47.780 --> 40:48.620]  in groups larger than three- I'm high.
[40:48.620 --> 40:50.900]  That was really hard to say.
[40:50.900 --> 40:53.840]  Is to get baked.
[40:53.840 --> 40:56.180]  And if we would just do it a little bit
[40:56.180 --> 40:58.060]  for like three years in a row,
[40:59.540 --> 41:00.820]  that's all it would take.
[41:02.300 --> 41:03.820]  That's all it would take.
[41:03.820 --> 41:05.700]  And I know it's never gonna happen.
[41:05.700 --> 41:06.540]  I'm just-
[41:06.540 --> 41:07.360]  Four years in a row.
[41:07.360 --> 41:08.200]  I'm not hopeful.
[41:08.200 --> 41:09.940]  A whole Trump presidency.
[41:09.940 --> 41:11.380]  Well, see, that's the thing.
[41:11.820 --> 41:13.860]  Year one's already over and it's only February.
[41:13.860 --> 41:15.700]  It's scary to say it.
[41:15.700 --> 41:17.780]  But that's how politics works.
[41:17.780 --> 41:18.940]  True, we're behind the-
[41:18.940 --> 41:21.600]  Because the last year is all campaign.
[41:23.180 --> 41:27.000]  And honestly, there's like 47 things on his agenda.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  We're gonna deplore all the illegals.
[41:29.000 --> 41:30.140]  We're gonna build the wall.
[41:30.140 --> 41:31.060]  So you mean in like two years,
[41:31.060 --> 41:33.300]  I have to watch all those stupid commercials again?
[41:33.300 --> 41:34.820]  It's gonna be like two and a half years, huh?
[41:34.820 --> 41:37.700]  Worse, in about four months, local election ads start.
[41:37.700 --> 41:39.060]  Yeah, but they're not nearly as bad
[41:39.060 --> 41:41.340]  as the presidential ads on TV.
[41:42.180 --> 41:43.460]  They get away with saying crazier shit,
[41:43.460 --> 41:46.100]  but they're not nearly as frequent as the national ads.
[41:46.100 --> 41:47.620]  And our local ads are kind of funny
[41:47.620 --> 41:50.420]  because I know the people and it's funny to see.
[41:50.420 --> 41:51.540]  It amuses me.
[41:51.540 --> 41:56.540]  But, oh, I even lost my little rant.
[41:56.700 --> 41:57.940]  Oh, I devolved you, I'm sorry.
[41:57.940 --> 41:58.900]  Get involved.
[41:58.900 --> 42:00.940]  Find out who you can contribute to financially
[42:00.940 --> 42:01.780]  if you're in the position.
[42:01.780 --> 42:02.620]  I know what I was saying.
[42:02.620 --> 42:03.440]  Do it, go.
[42:03.440 --> 42:07.220]  But the amount of shit Trump's got slated for already,
[42:07.220 --> 42:09.660]  just the stuff that he's kind of thrown together
[42:09.660 --> 42:12.300]  as this is seriously in the works we're working on
[42:12.300 --> 42:16.740]  and we're actually issuing directives and memorandums,
[42:16.740 --> 42:18.500]  telling people to work on it,
[42:18.500 --> 42:21.240]  that list of shit is already four years deep.
[42:22.300 --> 42:26.260]  When you add in campaigning for reelection,
[42:26.260 --> 42:28.700]  midterm elections and the work he has to do
[42:28.700 --> 42:29.660]  out on the stump saying,
[42:29.660 --> 42:32.200]  I'm your president, vote for this guy.
[42:32.200 --> 42:35.600]  Like, we don't really have time to go get all the stoners.
[42:36.860 --> 42:39.540]  The other thing I wanted to really emphasize
[42:40.380 --> 42:42.380]  while we're talking about this before we move on
[42:42.380 --> 42:47.140]  is that all of the press around this was scary sounding.
[42:47.140 --> 42:49.060]  If you watch the video and understand
[42:49.060 --> 42:51.500]  what's actually happening in the moment,
[42:51.500 --> 42:53.900]  this is something you've been waiting for to happen.
[42:53.900 --> 42:55.680]  It's not scary, it's expected.
[42:57.660 --> 43:00.380]  And there's good news in it too.
[43:00.380 --> 43:02.180]  And so don't freak out yet.
[43:02.180 --> 43:06.140]  The other good news is that no one's gonna be in jail
[43:06.140 --> 43:07.820]  in the next year or two
[43:07.820 --> 43:10.380]  because they work in the marijuana industry legally.
[43:10.380 --> 43:12.020]  And it's only been semi-illegal anyway.
[43:12.020 --> 43:13.620]  It's always been federally illegal.
[43:13.620 --> 43:16.020]  So we've always been kind of just pushing the button
[43:16.020 --> 43:17.140]  and pressing our luck.
[43:18.060 --> 43:21.660]  I mean, the legitimate threat of jail time is there,
[43:21.660 --> 43:25.700]  but the reality is that it's a numbers game.
[43:25.700 --> 43:29.400]  There's something like five or 6,000 DEA agents total.
[43:30.420 --> 43:32.780]  There's something like 25,000
[43:32.780 --> 43:35.760]  Colorado legal marijuana employees.
[43:36.200 --> 43:40.880]  There's something like 3,000 legal marijuana businesses
[43:40.880 --> 43:45.200]  across the state, almost a thousand storefronts.
[43:45.200 --> 43:46.280]  And so you just do the math.
[43:46.280 --> 43:51.280]  You're like, okay, two DEA agents, two businesses a day.
[43:51.680 --> 43:53.380]  It's just not workable.
[43:53.380 --> 43:55.840]  And when you add in that there's eight states
[43:55.840 --> 44:00.840]  that are wrecked now, it becomes completely undoable.
[44:00.960 --> 44:04.840]  And so any sort of action from the White House on this
[44:04.840 --> 44:08.040]  will be, and it'll start off with,
[44:08.040 --> 44:10.000]  we're officially gonna take an action.
[44:10.000 --> 44:11.880]  They'll come out and announce that coming up,
[44:11.880 --> 44:13.620]  they're gonna do something.
[44:13.620 --> 44:15.680]  And then in a couple of weeks,
[44:15.680 --> 44:17.120]  they'll announce what they're doing
[44:17.120 --> 44:20.440]  is most likely sending the eight states
[44:20.440 --> 44:21.840]  that have gone recreational,
[44:21.840 --> 44:23.640]  if that's all they choose to target,
[44:25.560 --> 44:27.200]  that they're gonna threaten
[44:27.200 --> 44:30.120]  some sort of major federal funding piece.
[44:30.120 --> 44:32.360]  If they continue to issue licenses.
[44:32.360 --> 44:34.480]  We're gonna take away all your highway funding.
[44:35.120 --> 44:36.520]  And that's what they did with the drinking age
[44:36.520 --> 44:39.360]  when they wanted to raise it to 21 coast to coast.
[44:39.360 --> 44:40.760]  And there were a number of states that were like,
[44:40.760 --> 44:42.480]  oh, fuck you, states rights.
[44:42.480 --> 44:45.040]  The feds were like, yo, you're totally right.
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.080]  Good luck without roads.
[44:47.080 --> 44:49.160]  And that was the only threat they had to make.
[44:49.160 --> 44:50.480]  They didn't even have to put it in writing.
[44:50.480 --> 44:52.240]  Some bullshit, tough love.
[44:52.240 --> 44:53.960]  And that's the reality of how states
[44:53.960 --> 44:55.000]  get their funding right now.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.960]  If Uncle Sam ain't happy with you,
[44:56.960 --> 44:58.840]  your state starves to death in a year.
[44:59.680 --> 45:04.680]  So it won't take much to really dismantle
[45:05.920 --> 45:07.640]  the industry coast to coast,
[45:07.640 --> 45:09.320]  if that's what they choose to do.
[45:09.320 --> 45:13.440]  But they're not gonna do it with big guns and vests.
[45:13.440 --> 45:15.520]  That won't show up for two years down the road
[45:15.520 --> 45:17.080]  until the last nine shops
[45:17.080 --> 45:19.120]  that won't shut down with threat letters.
[45:20.200 --> 45:21.400]  Tough kind love is just still out there
[45:21.400 --> 45:23.480]  slinging eights for fucking 70 bucks.
[45:23.480 --> 45:25.320]  Yep, until there's just one.
[45:25.320 --> 45:26.480]  And then it gets freaky.
[45:27.040 --> 45:29.160]  This'll be a slow, long process,
[45:29.160 --> 45:30.880]  just like it was building up to it.
[45:30.880 --> 45:32.240]  You remember when you had one store
[45:32.240 --> 45:33.360]  and then you had eight stores,
[45:33.360 --> 45:35.000]  and then you had 37 stores?
[45:35.000 --> 45:36.400]  I remember when we were the only store
[45:36.400 --> 45:38.280]  in the city of Pueblo, bro.
[45:38.280 --> 45:40.880]  It was an hour and 40 minute drive to the next one.
[45:40.880 --> 45:42.960]  There was that one spot in Pueblo West,
[45:42.960 --> 45:43.800]  but they had like.
[45:43.800 --> 45:45.280]  For like a minute.
[45:45.280 --> 45:46.120]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[45:46.120 --> 45:48.120]  We know another one that's still there.
[45:48.120 --> 45:49.000]  Oh, that one, yeah.
[45:49.000 --> 45:50.400]  I won't even say their name.
[45:54.130 --> 45:54.970]  Yeah, all right.
[45:54.970 --> 45:56.130]  Don't let me tangent that way.
[45:56.250 --> 45:57.890]  We're gonna take a turn here.
[45:57.890 --> 45:58.730]  People.
[45:58.730 --> 45:59.570]  Uh.
[45:59.570 --> 46:01.370]  Excuse my coughs.
[46:01.370 --> 46:03.330]  I took a giant dab while Mike was ranting.
[46:03.330 --> 46:04.170]  I am okay.
[46:04.170 --> 46:05.010]  Everything feels good.
[46:05.010 --> 46:06.370]  I just had to cough.
[46:06.370 --> 46:07.970]  We've been talking a lot about politics
[46:07.970 --> 46:10.650]  and this Sean Spicer and his bullshit.
[46:10.650 --> 46:11.490]  We're gonna talk about something
[46:11.490 --> 46:12.330]  a little bit different now.
[46:12.330 --> 46:15.290]  We're gonna talk about cannabis, cannabis consumption.
[46:16.410 --> 46:18.730]  So before I had this cactus cooler hash,
[46:18.730 --> 46:21.330]  I had our friend, the Barefoot Grower,
[46:21.330 --> 46:24.170]  make some other hash out of some flowers that I had.
[46:24.170 --> 46:25.650]  It was some cascade.
[46:26.170 --> 46:28.610]  And I had a nice portion of cascade shatter.
[46:28.610 --> 46:33.090]  I dabbed on that shit for, oh, a good month, honestly.
[46:33.090 --> 46:34.410]  Like I had a lot of it.
[46:34.410 --> 46:35.850]  I dabbed on it for like a solid month.
[46:35.850 --> 46:37.130]  All my friends at work loved it
[46:37.130 --> 46:38.570]  because I would dab on my breaks with them
[46:38.570 --> 46:39.970]  occasionally when I could.
[46:39.970 --> 46:41.250]  Like, bro, come get a dab of this.
[46:41.250 --> 46:43.410]  And they'd be like, holy shit, that ruins me.
[46:43.410 --> 46:44.930]  I was loving it.
[46:44.930 --> 46:47.610]  And then I noticed that when I would smoke with some people,
[46:47.610 --> 46:49.250]  they would get so high from it.
[46:49.250 --> 46:51.210]  And I could take giant dabs.
[46:51.210 --> 46:53.010]  And I'd just be like, man, that was delicious,
[46:53.010 --> 46:55.090]  but I don't really get super high from it.
[46:56.010 --> 46:58.610]  And then a couple of days ago, I was getting low.
[46:58.610 --> 47:01.810]  And I knew that the time from my new batch of hash
[47:01.810 --> 47:02.930]  to where my old batch of hash,
[47:02.930 --> 47:05.330]  there might be an overlap to where I would run out.
[47:05.330 --> 47:08.730]  So I got some hash from a dispensary.
[47:08.730 --> 47:10.890]  And it wasn't like super quality hash.
[47:10.890 --> 47:11.770]  It wasn't bad hash,
[47:11.770 --> 47:13.970]  but it wasn't like really expensive, fancy hash.
[47:13.970 --> 47:15.490]  It was just middle of the mall hash.
[47:15.490 --> 47:16.330]  You know, it was good.
[47:16.330 --> 47:17.890]  It was quality.
[47:17.890 --> 47:19.650]  It was, I work for a living hash.
[47:19.650 --> 47:22.650]  I got so fucking high off that hash, dude.
[47:23.290 --> 47:24.770]  Oh my God, one normal size dab.
[47:24.770 --> 47:25.850]  By the time I blew it out,
[47:25.850 --> 47:29.050]  I felt my eyes get that bloodshot tinge to it.
[47:29.050 --> 47:30.490]  And my face went a little fuzzy
[47:30.490 --> 47:32.370]  and my brain started dancing in my head like,
[47:32.370 --> 47:33.210]  oh, there it is.
[47:33.210 --> 47:34.810]  You've been missing that.
[47:34.810 --> 47:38.290]  Like, I really think that something,
[47:38.290 --> 47:41.410]  that a phenomenon happens with me and probably with you.
[47:41.410 --> 47:44.250]  Oh, I've heard many, many, many people talk about this.
[47:44.250 --> 47:47.010]  I call it strain lock is the name I've assigned it.
[47:47.010 --> 47:48.250]  No, it fully has a slang.
[47:48.250 --> 47:49.130]  It's called strain lock.
[47:49.130 --> 47:50.730]  I've heard many people.
[47:50.730 --> 47:52.810]  Do you agree that if you smoke the same strain
[47:52.810 --> 47:53.650]  day after day after day for-
[47:53.650 --> 47:55.810]  I totally have as I do it to myself with flowers all the time.
[47:55.810 --> 47:58.690]  How long does it take you with flowers to make that happen?
[47:58.690 --> 48:02.370]  It's, it depends how much I'm consuming and how fast.
[48:02.370 --> 48:03.210]  Okay.
[48:04.370 --> 48:05.210]  I can smoke-
[48:05.210 --> 48:07.770]  I did it, I did an outdoor blueberry at one point
[48:07.770 --> 48:09.250]  and I remember watching it happen
[48:09.250 --> 48:10.410]  and knowing it was happening
[48:10.410 --> 48:12.570]  and I couldn't do anything to stop it.
[48:12.570 --> 48:15.010]  Cause just how things were financially at the time.
[48:15.010 --> 48:18.690]  But I had like three nice quarter pound bags
[48:18.690 --> 48:21.090]  of this blueberry that I harvested
[48:21.090 --> 48:25.450]  and the first bag went real slow.
[48:26.290 --> 48:31.170]  I was taking nugs out of that bag for like two, three months
[48:31.170 --> 48:32.330]  just smoking like crazy.
[48:32.330 --> 48:34.250]  It was week outdoor that I do-
[48:34.250 --> 48:35.610]  I remember the batch.
[48:35.610 --> 48:37.690]  I remember that batch very well.
[48:37.690 --> 48:42.530]  But the first bag went real slow and the second bag,
[48:42.530 --> 48:45.770]  you know, it went a little faster, but not noticeably.
[48:45.770 --> 48:48.330]  The third bag was gone in like a week.
[48:48.970 --> 48:49.810]  Just smoking through it.
[48:49.810 --> 48:51.930]  I just, I couldn't get baked anymore.
[48:51.930 --> 48:54.770]  Like I would get, you know, any sort of like,
[48:54.770 --> 48:56.290]  you know what, I really need five minutes away.
[48:56.290 --> 48:58.250]  I need to go smoke a joint.
[48:58.250 --> 48:59.810]  That would go away.
[48:59.810 --> 49:02.930]  But the, oh, I'm baked would never kick in.
[49:02.930 --> 49:03.770]  Yeah.
[49:03.770 --> 49:04.690]  You're just getting the medicine
[49:04.690 --> 49:07.410]  and not enough to push your brain into that zone.
[49:07.410 --> 49:08.250]  Yep.
[49:08.250 --> 49:10.530]  And I had, I grew two plants that run
[49:10.530 --> 49:12.970]  and the other one came out terribly.
[49:12.970 --> 49:15.650]  It just, it got like two weeks before it was done
[49:15.650 --> 49:18.210]  and it just decided it was done and laid over.
[49:19.090 --> 49:20.210]  And I didn't know what I was doing at the time.
[49:20.210 --> 49:23.330]  So I just harvested it real quick and had a friend blast it.
[49:23.330 --> 49:25.250]  And it took them a while to get around to it
[49:25.250 --> 49:26.730]  because they took one look at the material
[49:26.730 --> 49:27.930]  and were like, oh, this is something
[49:27.930 --> 49:29.770]  somebody fucked up badly.
[49:29.770 --> 49:30.930]  It goes at the back of the line
[49:30.930 --> 49:33.090]  and it stays there until there isn't a line.
[49:33.090 --> 49:34.410]  And then it gets to go.
[49:36.410 --> 49:37.770]  And when I finally got it back,
[49:37.770 --> 49:39.490]  I was almost out of that blueberry.
[49:39.490 --> 49:41.370]  And the first dab I took of that,
[49:41.370 --> 49:44.490]  I mean, I was just like giggle baked for like
[49:44.490 --> 49:45.770]  two solid hours.
[49:45.770 --> 49:48.450]  And I remember thinking it's the strain lock.
[49:48.450 --> 49:50.610]  I've been on that blueberry for so long.
[49:50.610 --> 49:51.450]  Yeah.
[49:51.450 --> 49:53.530]  I just did it to myself a little bit
[49:53.530 --> 49:55.490]  with the last ounce I picked up.
[49:55.490 --> 49:57.570]  It was all I picked up.
[49:57.570 --> 50:00.130]  But I've been spacing plenty of my vintage hash
[50:00.130 --> 50:02.810]  in and out of it to keep that from happening too badly.
[50:02.810 --> 50:05.050]  I feel like I smoked so much of that Cascade Shatter,
[50:05.050 --> 50:06.330]  I became immune to it.
[50:06.330 --> 50:07.930]  My body was like, yeah, good job.
[50:07.930 --> 50:08.770]  There it is.
[50:08.770 --> 50:10.570]  I shop to avoid it.
[50:10.570 --> 50:13.970]  A buddy of mine, Dave, we used to get it real bad.
[50:13.970 --> 50:16.650]  I mean, way back in the day when it was $100 quarters,
[50:16.650 --> 50:18.810]  $400 ounces period for everyone.
[50:18.810 --> 50:19.650]  Yeah.
[50:19.650 --> 50:20.490]  And there's one guy in the neighborhood
[50:20.490 --> 50:22.410]  growing the same strain all the time, all the time.
[50:22.410 --> 50:23.610]  And you just go to that one guy
[50:23.610 --> 50:25.290]  and get that same strain every time.
[50:25.290 --> 50:27.290]  And eventually you're like, bro, I hate to say it,
[50:27.290 --> 50:28.730]  but grow something different.
[50:28.730 --> 50:31.450]  We would wait for our paydays to line up
[50:31.450 --> 50:33.730]  so that we could go to two guys.
[50:35.450 --> 50:37.730]  And then we would actively like, no, bro,
[50:37.730 --> 50:39.690]  we just smoked a bowl of that.
[50:39.690 --> 50:42.110]  We have to smoke a bowl of the other
[50:42.110 --> 50:43.610]  just to kind of even it out.
[50:44.130 --> 50:45.370]  To keep this from happening.
[50:45.370 --> 50:48.450]  Because those dry spells back then where it was like,
[50:48.450 --> 50:51.890]  oh, really only the blue grapes again, huh, bro?
[50:51.890 --> 50:54.410]  I've smoked myself to a point to where
[50:54.410 --> 50:56.570]  if I smoke too early in the morning,
[50:56.570 --> 50:58.850]  like I go to work early, you guys,
[50:58.850 --> 51:00.990]  like I'm going to work before the sun's up.
[51:00.990 --> 51:02.330]  It's dark when I drive to work.
[51:02.330 --> 51:04.530]  If I smoke before I go to work,
[51:04.530 --> 51:06.170]  by the time I'm off work,
[51:06.170 --> 51:08.810]  like, cause, or later in the night,
[51:08.810 --> 51:11.010]  we'll just, we'll take work out of the equation.
[51:11.010 --> 51:13.010]  We'll take any fucking function and driving out,
[51:13.370 --> 51:14.210]  we'll just make this innocent.
[51:14.210 --> 51:16.930]  On Saturday, on my day off on Saturday,
[51:16.930 --> 51:18.690]  if I wake up and take a dab at nine,
[51:18.690 --> 51:21.050]  and take a dab at 10, and take a dab at 11,
[51:21.050 --> 51:22.410]  by like five or six o'clock,
[51:22.410 --> 51:24.650]  I'm taking a half gram dabs and I'm just chasing it.
[51:24.650 --> 51:26.570]  Like I can't even get high properly.
[51:26.570 --> 51:29.190]  That's where I've dabbed myself into.
[51:29.190 --> 51:31.930]  I felt myself getting there.
[51:31.930 --> 51:36.830]  And then I had to take a trip and I was gone for 10 days.
[51:36.830 --> 51:38.290]  And when I got back, it was like,
[51:38.290 --> 51:39.490]  I was in high school again.
[51:39.490 --> 51:42.010]  That's what I was going to say is take a break.
[51:42.010 --> 51:44.410]  When you get to that point, just flush out the system.
[51:44.410 --> 51:46.850]  Don't smoke for, try not to smoke for one whole day.
[51:46.850 --> 51:48.410]  And then when you do smoke that next day,
[51:48.410 --> 51:50.010]  you'd be like, holy shit, that was worth it.
[51:50.010 --> 51:52.330]  I mean, I went from like daily heavy consumption
[51:52.330 --> 51:56.310]  for like several years to no consumption,
[51:56.310 --> 51:59.170]  almost just a tiny, tiny, tiny amount of consumption
[51:59.170 --> 52:00.970]  for 10 days.
[52:00.970 --> 52:04.890]  And when I came back, I hit the bong that I had left,
[52:04.890 --> 52:06.170]  like a half smoked bowl.
[52:06.170 --> 52:07.810]  And I just kind of looked at it and was like,
[52:07.810 --> 52:10.970]  oh, well, like I didn't really want to roast half a bowl
[52:10.970 --> 52:13.210]  that's already burnt and been sitting here for 10 days
[52:13.210 --> 52:17.570]  for my first weed back, but waste not, want not.
[52:17.570 --> 52:20.250]  And I hit it and I remember sitting the bong down
[52:20.250 --> 52:21.690]  and looking around my basement,
[52:21.690 --> 52:23.930]  being like, where am I for a minute?
[52:23.930 --> 52:25.770]  Oh, wow, I'm baked.
[52:25.770 --> 52:27.330]  And about five minutes later,
[52:27.330 --> 52:29.010]  I had to get up and walk down the hall
[52:29.010 --> 52:31.690]  and lay down in bed for 20 minutes.
[52:31.690 --> 52:33.410]  And that's the first time that had happened
[52:33.410 --> 52:34.810]  in like a decade.
[52:34.810 --> 52:35.650]  Yeah, at least 10 years.
[52:35.650 --> 52:38.970]  A little tolerance break will reset you quick.
[52:39.050 --> 52:42.210]  Do you ever go through phases to where you can just smoke
[52:42.210 --> 52:43.730]  and smoke and smoke and nothing happens,
[52:43.730 --> 52:44.850]  but then you have other phases
[52:44.850 --> 52:46.410]  to where you can just look at your bag of weed
[52:46.410 --> 52:48.050]  and you're like, God, I'm high.
[52:48.050 --> 52:53.050]  For a while, I was micro dosing with edibles all day long,
[52:54.650 --> 52:58.450]  just managing a couple of different injuries that I had.
[52:58.450 --> 53:02.650]  I was taking THC and CBD all day long.
[53:02.650 --> 53:05.490]  And I was playing with the, looking for the sweet spot dose.
[53:05.530 --> 53:09.490]  And so some days it was, we're so spoiled here.
[53:09.490 --> 53:11.650]  I'm taking Sativa tablets in the morning
[53:11.650 --> 53:13.570]  and Indica tablets in the afternoon
[53:13.570 --> 53:16.850]  and half THC, half CBD tablets,
[53:16.850 --> 53:18.690]  spaced out all day through.
[53:18.690 --> 53:21.930]  And I would screw up the dosing from time to time.
[53:21.930 --> 53:25.370]  And I remember like getting home,
[53:25.370 --> 53:29.090]  taking two bong hits, getting up and being like, uh-oh,
[53:29.090 --> 53:30.970]  I was shooting for a four
[53:30.970 --> 53:33.490]  because I got shit I need to do today.
[53:33.490 --> 53:36.650]  I'm at a six and headed to an eight.
[53:36.650 --> 53:39.770]  And what I'm gonna do now is go make a sandwich.
[53:39.770 --> 53:41.490]  And then I'm gonna sit somewhere
[53:41.490 --> 53:43.330]  and eat it quietly for 20 minutes.
[53:43.330 --> 53:45.530]  And then we'll reassess.
[53:45.530 --> 53:47.010]  Laundry ain't happening today.
[53:47.010 --> 53:48.890]  I'm not gonna make it to Home Depot.
[53:51.090 --> 53:53.250]  I try to push through those when I get that,
[53:53.250 --> 53:56.290]  oh no, this high, this dab has got me just too high.
[53:56.290 --> 53:58.770]  That's when I try to like, just, you gotta get up.
[53:58.770 --> 53:59.870]  When you feel it coming on,
[53:59.870 --> 54:01.010]  that's right when you gotta break.
[54:01.010 --> 54:02.570]  You gotta get up and get out the house.
[54:02.570 --> 54:04.090]  There's like a timeframe.
[54:04.090 --> 54:05.570]  And if I don't hit that timeframe,
[54:05.570 --> 54:08.570]  I become part of the couch or I become Instagram.
[54:08.570 --> 54:11.250]  That's what I do, just do, do, do, do, do on Insta.
[54:11.250 --> 54:12.610]  So I just gotta get up and leave.
[54:12.610 --> 54:14.170]  Sometimes I'll just get up and leave the house
[54:14.170 --> 54:17.030]  just to have gotten up and left the house.
[54:18.410 --> 54:20.890]  I've got a hash at the house right now.
[54:20.890 --> 54:23.170]  And the high, the only way I can describe it
[54:23.170 --> 54:26.610]  is everything's an interesting video game.
[54:26.610 --> 54:28.130]  And so like you can sit there
[54:28.130 --> 54:30.850]  and do 30 bottles through the sink
[54:30.850 --> 54:32.530]  and then or pull them out of the dishwasher
[54:33.370 --> 54:35.570]  and reassemble it and it's super entertaining.
[54:35.570 --> 54:40.250]  And with a good podcast or some Pandora on in the background,
[54:40.250 --> 54:43.890]  I'll lose half a day like that with the right hash.
[54:43.890 --> 54:45.770]  Just zipping around enjoying the day.
[54:45.770 --> 54:47.570]  Yep, getting stuff done.
[54:47.570 --> 54:48.570]  Nice, nice.
[54:48.570 --> 54:49.770]  Bro, we've been going for almost an hour.
[54:49.770 --> 54:51.810]  I feel like we should start wrapping up the podcast.
[54:51.810 --> 54:55.450]  Anything else you wanna say about Dickhead Sean Spicer
[54:55.450 --> 54:57.330]  or talk about Strain Lock?
[54:58.930 --> 55:00.490]  Or you can mention Jeff Sessions if you want,
[55:00.490 --> 55:03.850]  since for some reason his name almost came out of my face.
[55:03.850 --> 55:08.570]  Just, I mean, this is a drum I've been beating
[55:08.570 --> 55:10.250]  for a lot of years.
[55:10.250 --> 55:13.530]  And honestly, what I've seen personally,
[55:13.530 --> 55:15.850]  especially after this most recent election,
[55:16.770 --> 55:19.690]  I mean, we went from having our jobs
[55:19.690 --> 55:24.570]  maybe getting voted away to a success
[55:24.570 --> 55:26.890]  coast to coast for marijuana.
[55:26.890 --> 55:30.850]  And so for election night was a big win for a lot of us.
[55:30.850 --> 55:33.250]  I mean, I'm super liberal listeners
[55:33.250 --> 55:35.730]  if you hadn't figured that out yet, so I shock you.
[55:37.050 --> 55:39.930]  And so I was really bummed about President Trump,
[55:39.930 --> 55:43.330]  but I also wasn't excited about Hillary Clinton
[55:43.330 --> 55:44.890]  as a candidate just to throw that out there.
[55:44.890 --> 55:47.930]  So like it wasn't that big and marijuana won huge.
[55:47.930 --> 55:50.090]  And that was enough of a note for me
[55:50.090 --> 55:54.610]  to really take kind of a positive outlook from the election.
[55:54.610 --> 55:58.170]  And what I saw from the marijuana community here in Pueblo
[55:58.170 --> 55:59.850]  was relief, excitement,
[55:59.850 --> 56:02.050]  and then I gotta be fucking work on Monday.
[56:03.890 --> 56:07.930]  And it was so nice to just have our lives again,
[56:07.930 --> 56:10.290]  where you just had your responsibilities
[56:10.290 --> 56:12.650]  and you didn't have this annoying threat looming over you
[56:12.650 --> 56:15.130]  where there's this group of morons
[56:15.130 --> 56:17.250]  looking to take our jobs away
[56:17.250 --> 56:20.210]  because they can't stand driving past green crosses
[56:20.210 --> 56:21.410]  on their way to church.
[56:22.010 --> 56:24.290]  All of that went away
[56:24.290 --> 56:26.210]  and we could just be us again for a minute
[56:26.210 --> 56:28.730]  where we could get up and go to work and pay our bills
[56:28.730 --> 56:32.650]  and go to bed and make dinners and just live for a minute.
[56:32.650 --> 56:34.890]  And we took our eye off the ball.
[56:34.890 --> 56:38.050]  And we definitely did the same thing
[56:38.050 --> 56:40.690]  after we legalized recreational.
[56:40.690 --> 56:43.370]  Recreational legalization happened.
[56:43.370 --> 56:48.050]  We all focused on getting a shop up, getting a grow up,
[56:48.050 --> 56:49.490]  getting a job in the industry,
[56:49.530 --> 56:52.130]  keeping a job in the industry,
[56:52.130 --> 56:53.610]  innovating in the industry.
[56:53.610 --> 56:56.850]  And we took our eye off the ball with regulations
[56:56.850 --> 56:58.970]  and now we've got some really weird fucking rules
[56:58.970 --> 57:02.250]  in Colorado because the anti-pop people didn't.
[57:03.770 --> 57:07.290]  And if we don't kind of focus up
[57:07.290 --> 57:12.290]  and more people don't get active soon, we're in trouble.
[57:12.370 --> 57:16.650]  I mean, politics swings back and forth like a pendulum.
[57:17.650 --> 57:20.290]  If you look back over history and it gets clear,
[57:20.290 --> 57:22.770]  the further back in history you go,
[57:22.770 --> 57:25.890]  things go liberal, conservative, liberal, conservative,
[57:25.890 --> 57:29.170]  liberal, conservative about every 10 years.
[57:30.250 --> 57:33.050]  The last eight years weren't conservative at all.
[57:34.090 --> 57:37.690]  The next 10 years look to be like they might be.
[57:37.690 --> 57:40.490]  And that's not great news for the cannabis industry
[57:40.490 --> 57:43.090]  if we revert back to the one trait
[57:43.090 --> 57:44.330]  that we've all got in common
[57:44.370 --> 57:46.890]  and it's kept us alive as a community this long.
[57:46.890 --> 57:50.050]  And we hide well, we blend well.
[57:51.050 --> 57:54.250]  If we have to, we disappear and you can't see us at all.
[57:54.250 --> 57:56.370]  And we look like everybody else
[57:56.370 --> 57:58.450]  but smoke a lot of weed at night inside.
[57:59.890 --> 58:01.650]  And that kept us alive for decades
[58:01.650 --> 58:03.290]  and it's gonna kill us right now.
[58:05.170 --> 58:06.490]  Make yourselves known.
[58:06.490 --> 58:07.890]  Just, I mean, just take them.
[58:07.890 --> 58:09.250]  If you're like, you know, fuck it,
[58:09.250 --> 58:11.330]  like voting's dumb, it doesn't count.
[58:11.330 --> 58:12.570]  I don't need to pay attention to this.
[58:12.570 --> 58:14.130]  Somebody else is on it.
[58:14.890 --> 58:17.210]  Just take a minute and think about $400 ounces again
[58:17.210 --> 58:18.050]  for everybody.
[58:19.730 --> 58:23.210]  Think about every now and again running into Mexi-Brick
[58:23.210 --> 58:25.250]  and taking a few minutes and being like,
[58:25.250 --> 58:28.250]  maybe it's a way I can save 60 bucks this month.
[58:29.250 --> 58:30.970]  Remember what those days were like
[58:30.970 --> 58:34.090]  and ask yourself if you wanna go back.
[58:34.090 --> 58:35.330]  Nobody wants to go back to that.
[58:35.330 --> 58:37.890]  No one I know that's made the transfer
[58:37.890 --> 58:42.050]  into the legal industry wants anything to do with any part
[58:42.050 --> 58:44.770]  of what they had to deal with back in the day
[58:44.770 --> 58:47.970]  with the small exception of that kind of profit margin.
[58:50.290 --> 58:52.850]  Like that was the only thing that made anybody
[58:52.850 --> 58:55.650]  anything out of that old system.
[58:55.650 --> 58:57.810]  Yeah, it was too much profit to the wrong people.
[58:57.810 --> 58:59.850]  Yep, and it had to be that way
[58:59.850 --> 59:02.610]  and it could be that way because it was illegal.
[59:02.610 --> 59:06.530]  And the reason the price of an ounce over my adult life
[59:06.530 --> 59:09.770]  has gone from 400 an ounce for mediocre weed
[59:09.770 --> 59:12.730]  and you were super happy to buy it
[59:12.730 --> 59:17.090]  to 100 an ounce, 150 an ounce, 200 an ounce.
[59:17.090 --> 59:18.810]  You don't really want those $100 ounces.
[59:18.810 --> 59:19.650]  You don't.
[59:19.650 --> 59:23.570]  I saw a place pitching $50.
[59:23.570 --> 59:28.570]  It was a promo on social media, $50 ounces out the door.
[59:29.810 --> 59:30.650]  Nasty.
[59:30.650 --> 59:31.770]  And I know what the tax rate is
[59:31.770 --> 59:34.450]  and I'm like, how much of that is shoe leather?
[59:34.450 --> 59:35.730]  Like, good Lord.
[59:35.730 --> 59:38.130]  Just trim, just untrimmed funky buds.
[59:38.130 --> 59:38.970]  Right?
[59:39.490 --> 59:42.210]  Just what else could it possibly be?
[59:42.210 --> 59:45.010]  I see good ounces out there for like 135, 150
[59:45.010 --> 59:46.370]  in that region for good stuff.
[59:46.370 --> 59:47.570]  If you're willing to hunt,
[59:47.570 --> 59:52.570]  you can find a really solid ounce for a little under 150.
[59:52.570 --> 59:54.410]  Most places for something
[59:54.410 --> 59:55.730]  that you're gonna be super psyched about,
[59:55.730 --> 59:58.850]  I'm usually paying about 200 if I'm going to a rec shop
[59:58.850 --> 01:00:00.250]  with a decent menu price.
[01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:01.090]  Which isn't bad.
[01:00:01.090 --> 01:00:02.130]  Not bad at all.
[01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.930]  And honestly, I spent so long paying 400 an ounce
[01:00:05.930 --> 01:00:06.770]  and being happy about it,
[01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.130]  I'm not mind paying 200 an ounce, 250 an ounce
[01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.970]  if I have to.
[01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:12.570]  It doesn't feel so bad.
[01:00:12.570 --> 01:00:15.010]  And I know that if it ever comes to it,
[01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:18.930]  I can go get four ounces for 200 bucks
[01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:20.610]  and how if I need to.
[01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:24.410]  And it comes with a lab test attached to the package.
[01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.370]  You get all the spider mines and white flies
[01:00:27.370 --> 01:00:29.170]  you could ever want on one ounce.
[01:00:30.210 --> 01:00:34.770]  But I mean, there were so many things
[01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.290]  that are amazing about what we've done in Colorado
[01:00:37.290 --> 01:00:39.210]  over the last few years.
[01:00:39.210 --> 01:00:40.650]  I mean, I'm just looking at the table
[01:00:40.650 --> 01:00:42.850]  and I'm like, emails wouldn't be a thing
[01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:45.370]  if Colorado wouldn't have done what we did.
[01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.810]  I know that the hash we've got on this table
[01:00:48.810 --> 01:00:52.570]  wouldn't be around yet if Colorado hadn't done what we did.
[01:00:52.570 --> 01:00:54.250]  And I'm not at all looking forward
[01:00:54.250 --> 01:00:55.970]  to what the market might be like
[01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:58.250]  if people are trying to recreate
[01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:00.290]  what we've got now in basements.
[01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:06.290]  Like, basements produce a lot of amazing flower.
[01:01:08.370 --> 01:01:10.010]  But when it comes to the hash world,
[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.690]  you guys are just fucking hurting the industry
[01:01:11.690 --> 01:01:12.930]  trying to make that shit at home.
[01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.490]  Yeah, leave that to the lab.
[01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:15.890]  Leave that to the professionals.
[01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:18.650]  Please don't blow up your basement making hash.
[01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:19.490]  I didn't really hit it.
[01:01:19.490 --> 01:01:21.050]  Most of us are past that by now.
[01:01:21.050 --> 01:01:23.330]  I didn't really hit it at all during this
[01:01:23.330 --> 01:01:25.970]  because I was trying to stay at least a little positive.
[01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.330]  But we don't need any black eyes right now as a community.
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:32.490]  Every time somebody gets high and drives through a fence
[01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:35.850]  or over some pedestrian
[01:01:35.850 --> 01:01:40.130]  or blows up their fucking apartment making hash,
[01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.770]  we all take two steps back.
[01:01:41.770 --> 01:01:46.770]  And the people that really want to see nationwide raids,
[01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:50.410]  because that's what the anti-pop people are calling for,
[01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:53.970]  they're calling for nationwide raids.
[01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:56.370]  They're calling for 35,000 arrests.
[01:01:57.330 --> 01:02:00.170]  Because there were two other really scary moves
[01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:02.130]  nationally this week.
[01:02:02.130 --> 01:02:05.570]  One, we rescinded the move away from private prisons
[01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.090]  that went in last year.
[01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:09.130]  So all the private prisons don't have to worry
[01:02:09.130 --> 01:02:10.170]  about getting shut down
[01:02:10.170 --> 01:02:12.530]  and transferred back into state ownership.
[01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:15.290]  So we're gonna need people to keep them full.
[01:02:15.290 --> 01:02:18.330]  And I don't even remember what the fuck the other one was.
[01:02:18.330 --> 01:02:21.250]  There was another one that tied into those three.
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.250]  That does not look good.
[01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.130]  And I mean, they're gonna need people.
[01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:27.730]  They're gonna need to make arrests.
[01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:31.010]  And the anti-pop folks around the country,
[01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:33.610]  they've still stayed together.
[01:02:33.610 --> 01:02:35.650]  They've kept their eye on the ball since the election.
[01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:39.730]  They've been super excited to see President Trump
[01:02:39.730 --> 01:02:42.490]  pick Jeff Sessions to be our Attorney General.
[01:02:42.490 --> 01:02:45.250]  And it's been kind of fun watching the anti-pop people
[01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:46.610]  bicker about politics,
[01:02:46.610 --> 01:02:47.650]  because some of them are liberal
[01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:49.810]  and some of them are conservative.
[01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:52.490]  The only thing they agree on is they hate pot.
[01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:54.370]  And the only people that they can interact with
[01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.770]  on social media are other people that hate pot
[01:02:56.770 --> 01:02:59.090]  or think he called crazy a lot.
[01:02:59.090 --> 01:03:02.010]  And so they've been kind of in a war about President Trump
[01:03:02.010 --> 01:03:04.810]  and they're all super excited about him now
[01:03:04.810 --> 01:03:06.370]  because he picked Jeff Sessions
[01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:08.490]  who will go after marijuana for sure
[01:03:08.490 --> 01:03:11.890]  because that's sort of been his thing his whole life.
[01:03:11.890 --> 01:03:15.370]  And now this announcement or this response
[01:03:15.370 --> 01:03:19.130]  from Sean Spicer, like they're getting what they want.
[01:03:19.130 --> 01:03:21.210]  They're speaking up, they're writing people,
[01:03:21.210 --> 01:03:22.930]  they're writing their representatives,
[01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:24.850]  they're making phone calls.
[01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:28.530]  And that's what elected representatives listen to
[01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:29.690]  is how many people annoy them
[01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:31.770]  with phone calls and emails every week.
[01:03:31.770 --> 01:03:32.610]  You hear that guys?
[01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:34.290]  You gotta annoy people with phone calls,
[01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:35.290]  annoy the right people,
[01:03:35.290 --> 01:03:37.970]  let them know that you do not want to lose
[01:03:37.970 --> 01:03:39.530]  your recreational cannabis.
[01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:40.370]  Yep.
[01:03:41.370 --> 01:03:44.690]  Sharing stuff on Facebook helps inform people,
[01:03:44.690 --> 01:03:47.730]  your friends with the read things that they see on Facebook.
[01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:49.250]  Share real stuff.
[01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:51.930]  If you can share real stuff, please.
[01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:55.050]  But what really matters right now,
[01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:57.450]  what really actually does have an impact
[01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:59.210]  is making phone calls and sending emails
[01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.210]  to the right people.
[01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:04.890]  And the reality is that marijuana is way more popular
[01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:06.010]  than President Trump.
[01:04:07.490 --> 01:04:09.730]  If you look at the election results,
[01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:13.530]  he's like 52.1, marijuana is a 61.
[01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.130]  And that's coast to coast.
[01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:18.170]  That's awesome, that's good to know.
[01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:21.690]  In Pueblo, Trump won.
[01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:23.770]  And we're traditionally a Democratic area,
[01:04:23.770 --> 01:04:26.370]  so it was a huge win for the Republicans.
[01:04:26.370 --> 01:04:28.250]  I'm sure people just didn't go vote.
[01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:31.730]  Part of it's the Democrats didn't go vote
[01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:34.170]  for a number of different reasons.
[01:04:34.170 --> 01:04:35.850]  But I mean, politics swings.
[01:04:35.850 --> 01:04:39.290]  We've never had a two term president from one party
[01:04:39.290 --> 01:04:41.210]  followed by a president from the same party.
[01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:43.010]  It's never happened ever.
[01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:45.130]  Anyone who knows anything about politics
[01:04:45.130 --> 01:04:47.730]  knew that whatever fucking ass clown
[01:04:48.290 --> 01:04:50.210]  the GOP threw up in front of the fucking ticket
[01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.570]  was gonna be our next president.
[01:04:51.570 --> 01:04:53.050]  They could have picked anyone.
[01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:54.210]  They did, they did.
[01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:56.050]  They just picked any fucking monkey they could find.
[01:04:56.050 --> 01:04:57.170]  They threw a dart at the map
[01:04:57.170 --> 01:04:59.130]  and it landed in Trump Tower.
[01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.090]  And for better or worse,
[01:05:02.090 --> 01:05:05.090]  this is the train we're riding for the next four years.
[01:05:05.090 --> 01:05:07.810]  And honestly, if the community doesn't do
[01:05:07.810 --> 01:05:12.810]  what it needs to do and step up and unify now,
[01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:17.170]  we might not be here in four or eight years.
[01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:20.410]  It really wouldn't take much to undo everything we've done
[01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:23.490]  if they decided to undo it.
[01:05:23.490 --> 01:05:24.570]  Stay positive, everybody.
[01:05:24.570 --> 01:05:26.090]  Don't let Mike put you in a bleak mood.
[01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:27.330]  No, just get on it.
[01:05:27.330 --> 01:05:28.530]  If we all get on it, we win.
[01:05:28.530 --> 01:05:30.730]  I mean, the simple fact is it's a numbers game.
[01:05:30.730 --> 01:05:32.570]  There's 6,000 FBI agents.
[01:05:32.570 --> 01:05:34.810]  There's 20 million American pot smokers.
[01:05:34.810 --> 01:05:36.690]  Fucking come at me, bro.
[01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:37.970]  That was Mike speaking.
[01:05:37.970 --> 01:05:38.810]  Don't come at me, bro.
[01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:39.650]  I'm chilling.
[01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:40.490]  I'm high, don't fuck with me, please.
[01:05:40.490 --> 01:05:42.010]  If I'm the only one that says that,
[01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:44.050]  like that statement doesn't work.
[01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:46.850]  If even half of the 20 million people stand up
[01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:48.370]  and call a congressman and say,
[01:05:48.370 --> 01:05:51.650]  do not support going after recreational marijuana,
[01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:53.450]  at minimum, let states continue
[01:05:53.450 --> 01:05:55.290]  to do what they've been doing.
[01:05:55.290 --> 01:05:56.930]  And that's all you have to do and say.
[01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:58.890]  You don't have to, I'm so-and-so,
[01:05:58.890 --> 01:06:00.250]  and I live at this address,
[01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:01.930]  and I believe this because of this.
[01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:02.930]  You don't have to do any of that.
[01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:04.970]  Just, hi, you represent me.
[01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:08.210]  Please don't vote to go after marijuana.
[01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:09.210]  That's all you have to do.
[01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:10.290]  It's super easy.
[01:06:11.650 --> 01:06:14.490]  If even half the people that smoke pot this year
[01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:17.890]  make one phone call to a senator or a representative,
[01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:20.090]  we win this in a landslide.
[01:06:20.090 --> 01:06:23.530]  But the reality is one in 35 won't make a phone call.
[01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:24.690]  You guys make a phone call.
[01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:25.530]  Make a phone call.
[01:06:25.530 --> 01:06:26.930]  Who do they call exactly?
[01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:28.810]  They're elected officials.
[01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:31.710]  You've got two that matter in this vote.
[01:06:32.690 --> 01:06:34.130]  You're elected senator
[01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:37.410]  and you're elected House of Representatives member.
[01:06:37.410 --> 01:06:39.650]  And you can hop on Google and just type in,
[01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:41.210]  who is my senator?
[01:06:41.210 --> 01:06:43.210]  And it'll ask you to punch in your area code,
[01:06:43.770 --> 01:06:45.930]  then it will give you their office phone number,
[01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:48.050]  direct line to their voicemail,
[01:06:48.050 --> 01:06:49.730]  their direct email line.
[01:06:49.730 --> 01:06:51.010]  Call them.
[01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:51.850]  Speak clearly.
[01:06:51.850 --> 01:06:53.130]  Call an email.
[01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:55.090]  Yeah, hi, my name's Mike.
[01:06:55.090 --> 01:06:57.450]  I live in your district.
[01:06:57.450 --> 01:07:02.450]  Please don't vote to shut down state marijuana businesses.
[01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:05.930]  Leave recreational and medical marijuana alone.
[01:07:05.930 --> 01:07:07.890]  See, easy enough, you guys.
[01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:09.770]  All right, Mike, we're gonna wrap up this podcast.
[01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:10.690]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[01:07:10.690 --> 01:07:12.170]  make sure you support Handmade Apparel
[01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:13.210]  if you need something printed.

[01:07:14.330 --> 01:07:15.450]  You can get yourself a cool-ass hoodie
[01:07:15.450 --> 01:07:16.330]  with your face on it.
[01:07:16.330 --> 01:07:17.290]  You'll be happy you did.
[01:07:17.290 --> 01:07:18.130]  It'll be dope.
[01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:18.970]  Hey, if you guys are interested

[01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:27.370]  You just gotta promise to send me a picture
[01:07:27.370 --> 01:07:28.690]  when you wear it somewhere cool.
[01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:30.330]  I wanna see where you're wearing it.
[01:07:30.330 --> 01:07:32.290]  Let me remind you about Patreon.

[01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:55.730]  Some can't.
[01:07:55.730 --> 01:07:56.610]  I'm not judging at all.
