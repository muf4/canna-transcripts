[00:00.000 --> 00:01.640]  All right, all right, all right.
[00:01.640 --> 00:02.640]  We are rolling.
[00:02.640 --> 00:03.640]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:03.640 --> 00:08.460]  It is time for episode 498 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.460 --> 00:10.320]  We're going to start this episode off with a dab.
[00:10.320 --> 00:12.320]  I am currently heating up the dab nail.
[00:12.320 --> 00:16.820]  I have got a pretty fat dab of first class funk live batter from Green Dot Labs on the
[00:16.820 --> 00:17.880]  dabber here.
[00:17.880 --> 00:21.200]  This is a blend of GMO and jet fuel gelato.
[00:21.200 --> 00:25.560]  The flavor is described as hashy, grape, fuel, and garlic.
[00:25.560 --> 00:27.880]  I don't know if I get the grape in there.
[00:27.880 --> 00:30.280]  I for sure get the hashy and the garlic.
[00:30.280 --> 00:35.240]  I definitely get some funk, which is appropriate because it is called first class funk.
[00:35.240 --> 00:38.200]  I'm going to flip over the package here and read the back of the container.
[00:38.200 --> 00:45.640]  It says the product does contain 68.77% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[00:45.640 --> 00:47.680]  I've been smoking a lot of the first class funk.
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.360]  It is readily available at my local shop and they sell it in these four gram jars.
[00:52.360 --> 00:54.680]  I really like the four gram jar.
[00:54.680 --> 00:58.040]  Thinking about cracking open a jar and seeing that big four gram dollop in there always
[00:58.040 --> 00:59.280]  makes me happy.
[00:59.280 --> 01:00.980]  I go through a little bit of concentrate.
[01:00.980 --> 01:03.160]  This is a very economical way to do it.
[01:03.160 --> 01:05.400]  Less jars, less trips, less purchases.
[01:05.400 --> 01:08.800]  You guys, I think this dab is ready for me to hit.
[01:08.800 --> 01:09.800]  Dab with me.
[01:09.800 --> 01:10.800]  Let's do this.
[01:10.800 --> 01:17.550]  That is tasty.
[01:17.550 --> 01:29.750]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[01:29.750 --> 01:33.630]  It's time for episode 498 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:33.630 --> 01:36.910]  I'm going to do a stoned quick Thursday episode.
[01:36.990 --> 01:40.310]  Let's see if I can get through the intro before I start coughing.
[01:40.310 --> 01:43.910]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[01:43.910 --> 01:48.390]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[01:48.390 --> 01:49.630]  Seeds Here Now.
[01:49.630 --> 01:56.630]  Of course, you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[01:56.630 --> 02:00.310]  You guys, I can feel that first class funk dab just radiating through my body.
[02:00.310 --> 02:01.350]  It started at my lungs.
[02:01.350 --> 02:02.510]  It's kind of working its way out.
[02:02.510 --> 02:03.970]  My arms are getting a little heavy.
[02:03.970 --> 02:05.670]  My head feels a little fuzzy.
[02:05.670 --> 02:07.470]  My eyes are absolutely heavy.
[02:07.470 --> 02:10.630]  I'm getting that droopy-eyed stonedness, that mellow feeling that we like.
[02:10.630 --> 02:11.630]  I'm getting a little bit warm.
[02:11.630 --> 02:15.270]  I might have to turn down the heater and kick off my shoes here pretty soon.
[02:15.270 --> 02:18.310]  This first class funk dab is kicking.
[02:18.310 --> 02:23.310]  All right, podcast world, in this episode, I am going to read a couple of quick emails.
[02:23.310 --> 02:29.070]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to the folks who support the show on Patreon.
[02:29.070 --> 02:32.270]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast hug and a shout out to
[02:32.270 --> 02:33.270]  Miss Mel.

[02:55.350 --> 02:56.350]  Thank you to Sephirot.
[02:56.350 --> 03:00.910]  How about a big Growers high five and a fist bump to my buddy Kelly Canopy?
[03:00.910 --> 03:04.230]  We've got to send a big high five and a shout out to Freakfish.
[03:04.230 --> 03:08.550]  And of course, last but not least, let's give a giant shout out and a thank you to
[03:08.550 --> 03:11.670]  my buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[03:11.670 --> 03:15.350]  Big thanks, big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.

[03:28.710 --> 03:29.710]  All right.
[03:29.710 --> 03:32.430]  I feel like we've got all the business taken care of.
[03:32.430 --> 03:35.510]  Let's get to the main part of today's episode.
[03:35.510 --> 03:40.870]  I said I was going to read a couple of emails, so let's get right to that part of the show.
[03:40.870 --> 03:44.410]  I did get an email from a listener who gave me a lot of great compliments.
[03:44.410 --> 03:45.670]  They asked a couple of questions.
[03:45.670 --> 03:47.430]  I replied to them personally.
[03:47.430 --> 03:51.850]  I did, however, forget to print out that email before I deleted it, so I don't have the email
[03:51.850 --> 03:52.950]  in front of me.
[03:52.950 --> 03:58.030]  But the part I wanted to address on the show was they asked specifically why I do not do
[03:58.030 --> 03:59.390]  a video show.
[03:59.390 --> 04:01.630]  I've got a very good answer for you.
[04:01.750 --> 04:06.150]  That answer is the Grow From Your Heart podcast is a one-man show.
[04:06.150 --> 04:07.710]  I write all of the shows.
[04:07.710 --> 04:08.990]  I produce all of the shows.
[04:08.990 --> 04:09.990]  I edit.
[04:09.990 --> 04:10.990]  I post it.
[04:10.990 --> 04:11.990]  I do all of the social media.
[04:11.990 --> 04:16.030]  There is nobody else involved in this show other than when my guests come and be on the
[04:16.030 --> 04:17.030]  show.
[04:17.030 --> 04:18.590]  That is the only thing anybody else does.
[04:18.590 --> 04:20.830]  They show up and talk into a microphone.
[04:20.830 --> 04:23.830]  I have to come up with an idea for an episode.
[04:23.830 --> 04:25.070]  These ideas don't come out of nowhere.
[04:25.070 --> 04:28.110]  I've got to create something to talk about for 30 minutes.
[04:28.110 --> 04:30.830]  The first task is just having something to talk about.
[04:31.030 --> 04:35.470]  Then I've got to put a couple of notes together to have a roadmap of maybe a few bullet points
[04:35.470 --> 04:39.210]  that I want to make sure to cover and notes that I should make sure to hit in a Grow lesson
[04:39.210 --> 04:40.830]  or in a Grow topic.
[04:40.830 --> 04:43.230]  I basically have to manifest a podcast.
[04:43.230 --> 04:45.670]  I need an idea, then I need to put it on paper.
[04:45.670 --> 04:49.710]  Then from the paper, I need to sit down and put it into the microphone and put it into
[04:49.710 --> 04:50.990]  the computer.
[04:50.990 --> 04:53.430]  Once it's in the computer, I need to go back and edit.
[04:53.430 --> 04:57.670]  No matter how long it took me to record the show, I will be sitting here for that length
[04:57.670 --> 05:01.750]  of time again, listening back to the show to make sure everything sounds good, to make
[05:01.750 --> 05:05.390]  sure you don't get too much throat clearing, make sure you don't get too many coughs, make
[05:05.390 --> 05:09.270]  sure you don't get too many ums, and make sure I didn't make any mistakes in a Grow lesson.
[05:09.270 --> 05:13.630]  Now I've manifested a show, I've recorded a show, I've edited the show.
[05:13.630 --> 05:17.750]  Then there are a few more buttons to push after that to get the show up to the RSS feed.
[05:17.750 --> 05:22.230]  Then once that is complete, I make just a basic video for the show to put up on YouTube.
[05:22.230 --> 05:26.790]  It is mostly a few static images that rotate every couple of minutes, but that does take
[05:26.910 --> 05:28.950]  a few minutes to produce that video.
[05:28.950 --> 05:30.070]  Then I get that up to YouTube.
[05:30.070 --> 05:33.950]  I've got to type in all the video descriptions and make sure that I age restrict my video
[05:33.950 --> 05:36.070]  so I don't get taken down by YouTube.
[05:36.070 --> 05:41.430]  But it does take me a little bit of time and a little bit of energy to create this podcast.
[05:41.430 --> 05:47.830]  If I were to add the video aspect to the show, it would probably double or triple my workload
[05:47.830 --> 05:50.630]  because video is much more work.
[05:50.630 --> 05:54.910]  I would have multiple cameras because you need multiple cameras for good editing, and
[05:54.910 --> 05:58.230]  then it would make editing completely more challenging.
[05:58.230 --> 06:01.230]  It would take a lot more time to edit the video.
[06:01.230 --> 06:04.710]  Audio recording and audio editing has become simple to me.
[06:04.710 --> 06:08.430]  Video editing is very challenging and very time consuming.
[06:08.430 --> 06:13.510]  Part of me feels like just taking the time away from this show to learn the video equipment
[06:13.510 --> 06:18.230]  to get good at video editing and actually produce a video would take away from the overall
[06:18.230 --> 06:20.990]  quality of the audio show that I give you.
[06:20.990 --> 06:24.770]  I feel like I put out a fairly high quality podcast in many aspects.
[06:25.630 --> 06:27.850]  The audio quality should be quite high most of the time.
[06:27.850 --> 06:32.810]  I feel like I put quite a bit of effort into making sure I give an accurate and detailed
[06:32.810 --> 06:34.250]  grow lesson.
[06:34.250 --> 06:38.470]  I try to do it in a way that people that learn from multiple different styles will catch
[06:38.470 --> 06:43.650]  on and be able to learn from one show because there are people that are visual learners,
[06:43.650 --> 06:47.170]  people that are hands-on learners, people that are book learners, and people that just
[06:47.170 --> 06:49.290]  have a hard time learning in general.
[06:49.290 --> 06:52.730]  I try to explain things in a way that everybody can catch on.
[06:52.730 --> 06:54.810]  That's why sometimes you hear me just beating a dead horse.
[06:54.810 --> 06:59.410]  I repeat the same thing multiple ways, but sometimes that fourth way that I said it is
[06:59.410 --> 07:02.010]  the way that that one guy over there finally it all made sense to him.
[07:02.010 --> 07:03.370]  He goes, oh, like that.
[07:03.370 --> 07:05.690]  The first three descriptions didn't make any sense to him.
[07:05.690 --> 07:09.570]  I try to give a really thorough description and lesson.
[07:09.570 --> 07:14.050]  I try to paint a picture so that everybody can see the goal of what I'm trying to teach.
[07:14.050 --> 07:18.850]  I feel like if I spent too much time making a video, it would take away from the quality
[07:18.850 --> 07:22.410]  of those lessons, of that detailed grow knowledge that I give you.
[07:23.090 --> 07:24.090]  I don't want to take away from that.
[07:24.090 --> 07:25.090]  That's what I'm here for.
[07:25.090 --> 07:29.170]  I do appreciate that you want to see my lovely face while I'm doing a show.
[07:29.170 --> 07:32.650]  Honestly, it is the same thing as me doing an Instagram Live video.
[07:32.650 --> 07:35.410]  If you've ever seen me on Instagram Live, it's the same thing.
[07:35.410 --> 07:39.210]  I'm just sitting here rambling, except when the podcast is happening, I've got headphones
[07:39.210 --> 07:40.210]  and a microphone.
[07:40.210 --> 07:43.530]  On the Instagram Live, I don't wear headphones and I don't have a mic.
[07:43.530 --> 07:44.810]  That's the main difference.
[07:44.810 --> 07:48.730]  If you've never caught my Instagram Lives, every Monday at 7 p.m.
[07:48.730 --> 07:49.730]  Mountain Time.
[07:49.730 --> 07:52.010]  It's usually about 7.10, 7.15-ish.
[07:52.010 --> 07:53.010]  Mountain Time.
[07:53.010 --> 07:54.010]  I don't know your time zone.
[07:54.010 --> 07:55.010]  This is 7 p.m.
[07:55.010 --> 07:56.010]  Mountain Time.
[07:56.010 --> 08:00.650]  I jump on Instagram Live and I go on live for an hour and answer grow questions and
[08:00.650 --> 08:03.170]  take some dabs and bullshit with my friends on there.
[08:03.170 --> 08:05.450]  If you've never joined me for that, I invite you.
[08:05.450 --> 08:08.210]  On Instagram, I am irie underscore genetics.
[08:08.210 --> 08:11.330]  I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[08:11.330 --> 08:12.530]  Irie genetics.
[08:12.530 --> 08:13.530]  The word is Irie.
[08:13.530 --> 08:14.530]  It's a Jamaican word.
[08:14.530 --> 08:18.170]  It just means to feel blessed, pleasant, and powerful.
[08:18.170 --> 08:19.170]  My genetics are Irie.
[08:19.170 --> 08:21.730]  They feel good and they're powerful and they are pleasing.
[08:21.730 --> 08:24.250]  So I'm irie underscore genetics on Instagram.
[08:24.250 --> 08:28.050]  I encourage you to check out my Instagram Live feeds on Monday.
[08:28.050 --> 08:31.930]  That can be your video visual representation for the podcast.
[08:31.930 --> 08:33.070]  You're not missing much.
[08:33.070 --> 08:34.930]  It's honestly me just sitting here.
[08:34.930 --> 08:39.090]  Sometimes I wave my hands around in the air when I speak just to give myself some energy.
[08:39.090 --> 08:42.930]  Sometimes I point at certain directions just randomly because I use my hands when I talk,
[08:42.930 --> 08:44.870]  but you're not really missing a lot.
[08:44.870 --> 08:48.870]  So I guess the short answer to that long ramble was I don't do video because it would
[08:48.870 --> 08:52.110]  detract from the quality of the audio podcast.
[08:52.110 --> 08:56.710]  I'm kind of a perfectionist, and so that video would be fucking awesome and that would take
[08:56.710 --> 08:57.710]  a lot of time.
[08:57.710 --> 09:02.710]  There would probably only be one show every week if I did video, and I don't want to take
[09:02.710 --> 09:04.590]  that away from my friends and my listeners.
[09:04.590 --> 09:07.110]  So thank you for the great question.
[09:07.110 --> 09:08.110]  Big up.
[09:08.110 --> 09:09.110]  I hope your grow is going great.
[09:09.110 --> 09:12.030]  I wish I would have printed your email so that I could give you a shout out, but you
[09:12.030 --> 09:13.910]  know who you are.
[09:13.950 --> 09:14.950]  All right.
[09:14.950 --> 09:20.470]  I'm going to try to dial in the rambles and let's get to the next email on this episode.
[09:20.470 --> 09:22.070]  This email goes a lot like this.
[09:22.070 --> 09:27.730]  It says, hi, I have a question about the flowering times listed for your feminized golden goat.
[09:27.730 --> 09:32.950]  When you state that the flowering time is 60 to 70 days, is that from the point of change
[09:32.950 --> 09:38.830]  to a 12-12 light cycle or from the point when the first flower appears?
[09:38.830 --> 09:39.830]  Then they signed it.
[09:39.830 --> 09:40.830]  Thanks, Todd.
[09:40.830 --> 09:42.870]  Hey, Todd, thank you for the great question.
[09:42.870 --> 09:44.870]  Let's talk about flowering times.
[09:44.870 --> 09:50.350]  A lot of times when you buy a package of seeds, it will say how long to expect those seeds
[09:50.350 --> 09:52.750]  to take in their flowering phase.
[09:52.750 --> 09:58.350]  On my packages of golden goat, it says flowering time is 60 to 70 days.
[09:58.350 --> 10:04.030]  So this person wants to know if we start that 60 to 70 day count from the day we switch
[10:04.030 --> 10:10.710]  the lights to 12-12 or from when those plants start to show their first pre-flowers.
[10:10.710 --> 10:18.630]  The answer to that is you start your flowering cycle the day you flip your plants to 12-12.
[10:18.630 --> 10:22.790]  So that first day you've got your plants on 12 hours on and 12 hours off, that is day
[10:22.790 --> 10:23.790]  one.
[10:23.790 --> 10:24.790]  That is when it begins.
[10:24.790 --> 10:29.870]  The day you flip the timer, write it down, day one, you are in full control of that.
[10:29.870 --> 10:32.590]  So day one is when you flip that timer.
[10:32.590 --> 10:34.470]  Hey, Todd, thank you for the great email.
[10:34.470 --> 10:36.790]  Let me know if you've got any more grow questions.
[10:36.790 --> 10:37.950]  Good luck in your garden, my friend.
[10:37.950 --> 10:39.830]  All right, I've got another email.
[10:39.830 --> 10:42.890]  This one comes from somebody who calls themselves Wags.
[10:42.890 --> 10:45.310]  It says, use my name if you want.
[10:45.310 --> 10:46.310]  People call me Wags.
[10:46.310 --> 10:47.310]  What up, Wags?
[10:47.310 --> 10:48.310]  Good to meet you.
[10:48.310 --> 10:51.390]  The message goes a lot like this.
[10:51.390 --> 10:52.910]  Thank you for everything you do.
[10:52.910 --> 10:53.910]  You are appreciated.
[10:53.910 --> 10:55.150]  Hey, thank you, man.
[10:55.150 --> 10:56.390]  That means a lot.
[10:56.390 --> 11:00.110]  All of those words of encouragement do keep me charged up and keep me going for the show.
[11:00.110 --> 11:01.110]  So thank you.
[11:01.110 --> 11:04.430]  The message goes on to say, it says, I am in prohibition land.
[11:04.430 --> 11:06.150]  So variety is not an option.
[11:06.150 --> 11:09.270]  I'm usually at the mercy of whatever my guy could get.
[11:09.710 --> 11:14.270]  Yes, unfortunately, if you are not in a regulated cannabis area, you're basically buying what
[11:14.270 --> 11:16.250]  is available to you.
[11:16.250 --> 11:19.590]  This guy says, because of this, I have decided to grow my own.
[11:19.590 --> 11:23.110]  Congratulations, but be careful down there in prohibition land.
[11:23.110 --> 11:27.430]  It says, I've read a couple of books and listened to a ton of podcasts.
[11:27.430 --> 11:30.190]  Yours has by far been my favorite.
[11:30.190 --> 11:31.270]  Thank you for that.
[11:31.270 --> 11:35.350]  It says, you give a lot of knowledge in a way that almost anyone could understand.
[11:35.350 --> 11:38.450]  Hey, that's awesome because that's what I was rambling about just a moment ago.
[11:38.450 --> 11:40.570]  I'm glad you're picking up on that.
[11:40.570 --> 11:43.690]  It also says, maybe you should write a book.
[11:43.690 --> 11:47.290]  You know, I thought about writing a book and I probably rambled about this on the podcast
[11:47.290 --> 11:48.290]  before.
[11:48.290 --> 11:52.050]  I started off by thinking I wanted to write a cannabis grow book, but as I was reading
[11:52.050 --> 11:57.330]  grow books, I noticed that as soon as a book came out, basically that information was out
[11:57.330 --> 11:58.530]  of date.
[11:58.530 --> 12:00.990]  Cannabis is evolving so quickly right now.
[12:00.990 --> 12:02.750]  Growing is evolving so quickly.
[12:02.750 --> 12:06.810]  The science behind cannabis and growing are rapidly advancing.
[12:06.890 --> 12:12.210]  If I were to write a book, by the time I got to chapter 12, chapter one would be obsolete.
[12:12.210 --> 12:15.330]  By the time that book got to a publisher, it would be done.
[12:15.330 --> 12:19.490]  By the time that book got to you, it would be last year's fucking news and it wouldn't
[12:19.490 --> 12:21.370]  be relevant any longer.
[12:21.370 --> 12:26.170]  I realized the way I could keep this information up to date was by doing a podcast.
[12:26.170 --> 12:31.050]  I can record a show today and if I learn something tomorrow, I can record another show the next
[12:31.050 --> 12:32.950]  day and go, hey, you guys, I learned some new shit.
[12:32.950 --> 12:34.530]  This is how we're going to do it now.
[12:34.530 --> 12:38.650]  I can come out here and I can update you and I can just give you fresh content, fresh
[12:38.650 --> 12:40.690]  updates as it's happening.
[12:40.690 --> 12:44.370]  I thought a book was a good idea, but a podcast felt more practical.
[12:44.370 --> 12:46.890]  I feel like podcasts seem to reach more people now anyway.
[12:46.890 --> 12:48.570]  Nobody reads anymore.
[12:48.570 --> 12:52.770]  It looks like half the people who bought the Jorge Cervantes grow Bible or an Ed Rosenthal
[12:52.770 --> 12:56.090]  grow book set it next to the toilet and forgot to read it.
[12:56.090 --> 13:00.010]  If I go to one of my friends' house and I go to take a piss, there's always a grow book
[13:00.010 --> 13:03.770]  by the toilet and it has never moved since the first time I've been there.
[13:04.010 --> 13:05.010]  It's always dusty.
[13:05.010 --> 13:09.410]  I can tell they are not reading the grow books, but they do listen to podcasts because they've
[13:09.410 --> 13:11.850]  got to drive, they've got to be at work.
[13:11.850 --> 13:14.050]  Everybody wants some sort of entertainment in their ear.
[13:14.050 --> 13:18.410]  We've all got ADD and a podcast is a great way to feed that ADD.
[13:18.410 --> 13:22.490]  So I feel like it was easier just to talk and let people listen instead of trying to
[13:22.490 --> 13:24.010]  force people to read a book.
[13:24.010 --> 13:25.850]  So here we are with the podcast.
[13:25.850 --> 13:26.850]  Let's keep moving.
[13:26.850 --> 13:30.490]  This message says, while the purpose of this message is just to say thank you and let you
[13:30.490 --> 13:31.850]  know that you're doing a great job.
[13:31.850 --> 13:34.930]  I do have a quick question.
[13:34.930 --> 13:36.050]  Thank you for the great message, man.
[13:36.050 --> 13:40.330]  I do appreciate hearing the praise and the words of encouragement.
[13:40.330 --> 13:41.730]  Let's get to your question.
[13:41.730 --> 13:44.890]  It says, my main goal for growing is medicinal.
[13:44.890 --> 13:50.490]  Is there a strain which you can recommend for PTSD, depression, and anxiety?
[13:50.490 --> 13:52.690]  Any information is appreciated.
[13:52.690 --> 13:54.490]  Thanks again for everything.
[13:54.490 --> 13:55.810]  Keep up the great work.
[13:55.810 --> 13:56.810]  You rock.
[13:56.810 --> 13:57.810]  Signed, Wags.
[13:57.810 --> 13:59.850]  Hey Wags, that is a great question.
[14:00.210 --> 14:01.210]  Thank you.
[14:01.210 --> 14:07.730]  Let's dive into what I can suggest for PTSD, depression, and anxiety.
[14:07.730 --> 14:12.250]  Now before I go giving recommendations, I do probably have to give a disclaimer that
[14:12.250 --> 14:13.250]  I'm not a doctor, bro.
[14:13.250 --> 14:16.450]  I have no medical certifications at all.
[14:16.450 --> 14:20.610]  I'm a white guy with dreadlocks who has a lot of experience in the cannabis world.
[14:20.610 --> 14:21.970]  That's where my knowledge comes from.
[14:21.970 --> 14:26.890]  So don't take any of this as medical advice or medical recommendations or don't sue me
[14:26.890 --> 14:28.530]  or none of that kind of shit.
[14:28.530 --> 14:30.890]  This is just bro to bro talk.
[14:30.890 --> 14:32.170]  Here we go.
[14:32.170 --> 14:37.570]  From the iReed Genetics lineup, the things I've noticed that work very well for PTSD,
[14:37.570 --> 14:41.890]  depression, and anxiety are things like Lemon Jeffrey.
[14:41.890 --> 14:47.530]  Lemon Jeffrey is very soothing for social anxiety and anxiety in general, which also
[14:47.530 --> 14:49.410]  seems to help with depression.
[14:49.410 --> 14:53.010]  I feel like that would probably also ease some PTSD.
[14:53.010 --> 14:56.550]  So Lemon Jeffrey is a recommendation I would start with.
[14:56.550 --> 15:00.710]  Then I would move to the Sun Kiss and Orange Gasm.
[15:00.710 --> 15:04.910]  Something in that orangey terp really makes good moods.
[15:04.910 --> 15:09.710]  I know it may sound weird, but orange terps always put a smile on my face.
[15:09.710 --> 15:13.550]  And I've noticed that when most people smoke the orange terpy stuff, they really get a
[15:13.550 --> 15:14.550]  smile.
[15:14.550 --> 15:15.550]  They get in a better mood.
[15:15.550 --> 15:16.550]  They get uplifted.
[15:16.550 --> 15:17.990]  I find that it eases the anxiety.
[15:17.990 --> 15:21.270]  I find that it puts you in a good mood, which will help fight the depression.
[15:21.270 --> 15:24.990]  And those types of things will lead to kind of warding off the PTSD.
[15:24.990 --> 15:28.790]  It makes you forget you've got PTSD because you're in too good of a mood, just bouncing
[15:28.790 --> 15:30.230]  around smiling.
[15:30.230 --> 15:35.510]  So from the Iree Genetics lineup, I would start with the Lemon Jeffrey.
[15:35.510 --> 15:40.430]  The limonene in there really seems to work well for anxiety and depression.
[15:40.430 --> 15:44.390]  And again, those will lead well to helping with the PTSD.
[15:44.390 --> 15:48.230]  Then I would work over to the Sun Kiss or the Orange Gasm.
[15:48.230 --> 15:49.790]  Sun Kiss is feminized.
[15:49.790 --> 15:51.510]  Orange Gasm is not feminized.
[15:51.510 --> 15:55.390]  The main difference, I've talked about this in a previous show, is the Sun Kiss has a
[15:55.390 --> 15:56.390]  rise in it.
[15:56.390 --> 16:00.910]  So it's going to be more prone to have some funky or gassy feet kind of smells.
[16:00.910 --> 16:04.470]  And the Orange Gasm doesn't have the daybreaker trait in there.
[16:04.470 --> 16:06.030]  So it's not going to get that gassy funk.
[16:06.030 --> 16:11.670]  It is more sweet, more orangey, maybe a possibility of maybe some grapefruit, maybe some orange
[16:11.670 --> 16:13.670]  rind type of terps coming from there.
[16:13.670 --> 16:18.870]  So those orange terps always seem to work well for the PTSD, depression, anxiety.
[16:18.870 --> 16:21.430]  I always think the orange terps get people talkative.
[16:21.430 --> 16:26.030]  They get you social and they get you moving a little bit more than some of the piney terps,
[16:26.030 --> 16:27.030]  some of the gassy stuff.
[16:27.030 --> 16:29.030]  Some of that stuff is a little mind-blowing sometimes.
[16:29.030 --> 16:32.550]  I feel like it makes you just too high to even fucking communicate with people.
[16:32.550 --> 16:36.950]  So I think that the fruitier, the lemon, the orangey stuff may be the way to go.
[16:36.950 --> 16:40.030]  Of course, I recommended some Iree Genetics strains.
[16:40.030 --> 16:44.350]  Maybe I should mention some other things that I did not breed, give you a few more options.
[16:44.350 --> 16:50.670]  I really find that Jilly Bean works well for anxiety and depression and PTSD, and
[16:50.670 --> 16:54.190]  it does that same thing for getting you going in a social situation.
[16:54.190 --> 16:56.750]  Of course, it's got that really orange terp to it.
[16:56.750 --> 16:58.710]  You may find an orange phenotype.
[16:58.710 --> 17:01.310]  You may find what is called the candy store phenotype.
[17:01.310 --> 17:03.790]  Both of them will work well for you.
[17:03.790 --> 17:10.070]  You may also want to experiment with CBD-dominant genetics.
[17:10.070 --> 17:13.190]  Medicine that is higher in CBD may be the way you want to go.
[17:13.190 --> 17:15.990]  I don't know your smoking experience.
[17:15.990 --> 17:17.430]  I don't know your brain chemistry.
[17:17.430 --> 17:18.750]  I don't know your body chemistry.
[17:18.750 --> 17:20.350]  I don't know what you're into.
[17:20.350 --> 17:25.110]  So I'm not sure if CBD or THC is going to be the way to go for you.
[17:25.110 --> 17:28.550]  But you may want to experiment with CBD products as well.
[17:28.550 --> 17:30.750]  CBD will help with the anxiety.
[17:30.750 --> 17:32.990]  CBD will help with the depression.
[17:32.990 --> 17:36.230]  CBD will possibly help with the PTSD.
[17:36.230 --> 17:37.870]  And there are no bad side effects.
[17:37.870 --> 17:40.310]  So if it's not working, it's just not working.
[17:40.310 --> 17:45.630]  The only negative of the CBD is it may cut down on your THC buzz.
[17:45.630 --> 17:50.950]  So if you'd really like to have a nice THC high, the CBD will cut that down.
[17:50.950 --> 17:56.790]  I am not a CBD breeder or a CBD grower, but if you were looking for quality CBD seeds,
[17:56.790 --> 17:59.830]  I could recommend Medtree Seeds.
[17:59.830 --> 18:03.030]  They make a lot of great, high-quality CBD flowers.
[18:03.030 --> 18:07.710]  And there are many other CBD-dominant strains on the market.
[18:07.710 --> 18:11.310]  Now I know I've got a lot of information and this may get confusing, but you can rewind
[18:11.310 --> 18:13.150]  and listen a couple of times and take notes.
[18:13.150 --> 18:14.790]  This may help you out.
[18:14.790 --> 18:20.790]  Another thing that may be an option for you is different ratios of THC to CBD.
[18:20.790 --> 18:25.510]  You may start with a one-to-one, a 50-50 mix of CBD and THC.
[18:25.510 --> 18:26.990]  See how that works for you.
[18:26.990 --> 18:30.550]  If you're getting too much head effect from it, put more CBD in the mix.
[18:30.550 --> 18:34.310]  If you're not getting enough effect from it, add more THC to the mix.
[18:34.310 --> 18:36.750]  The only problem with this is you are in prohibition land.
[18:36.790 --> 18:41.030]  You're not going to have a lot of options for lab testing.
[18:41.030 --> 18:45.750]  One thing you can probably do is get a package of real CBD tincture.
[18:45.750 --> 18:49.150]  Make sure it is real CBD from a reputable CBD company.
[18:49.150 --> 18:53.150]  I'm not going to make any recommendations right now because no matter who I say, I'm
[18:53.150 --> 18:57.750]  going to get 20 emails from people telling me why they are shit and that their company
[18:57.750 --> 18:58.750]  is better.
[18:58.750 --> 19:04.830]  But find a reputable CBD distributor, get a tincture, and take that tincture as recommended
[19:04.910 --> 19:08.990]  for two or three days if you can handle it, if you don't have any adverse effects you
[19:08.990 --> 19:10.190]  don't enjoy.
[19:10.190 --> 19:12.150]  See how that works for you.
[19:12.150 --> 19:16.470]  After a day or two, see if your depression and anxiety are starting to ease up a little
[19:16.470 --> 19:17.470]  bit.
[19:17.470 --> 19:20.950]  CBD could be the answer, and this is a very easy way to find out.
[19:20.950 --> 19:25.190]  If we experiment with the CBD and it doesn't do anything, then it's time to experiment
[19:25.190 --> 19:26.550]  with THC.
[19:26.550 --> 19:30.150]  If you're buying your medicine from a black market or a gray market or a whatever kind
[19:30.150 --> 19:33.470]  of free market, whatever you want to call it, if you're getting it from your dude, that
[19:33.470 --> 19:36.430]  is probably a THC-heavy product.
[19:36.430 --> 19:40.950]  That is probably what your guy is focusing on growing and distributing is THC.
[19:40.950 --> 19:42.310]  That's what everybody wants.
[19:42.310 --> 19:43.910]  So get some of that and smoke it.
[19:43.910 --> 19:47.790]  Compare that to how you got effects from the CBD tincture that you took.
[19:47.790 --> 19:49.870]  Now which one is working best for you?
[19:49.870 --> 19:54.310]  That is probably the best way to decipher if you need CBD or THC.
[19:54.310 --> 19:55.590]  Now you know what I'm going to say next.
[19:55.590 --> 20:00.510]  Why not smoke a fat joint and do a big dropper full of that CBD tincture and see what happens?
[20:00.510 --> 20:03.110]  Now you've got THC and CBD in your body.
[20:03.110 --> 20:06.230]  You will start finding the ratios that work best for you.
[20:06.230 --> 20:09.030]  That's when you want to start researching the seeds that you want to buy.
[20:09.030 --> 20:10.030]  Do you want THC?
[20:10.030 --> 20:11.110]  Do you want CBD?
[20:11.110 --> 20:13.830]  Or do you want something with a nice blend?
[20:13.830 --> 20:20.470]  And then start researching specific seeds with those specific ratios of THC to CBD.
[20:20.470 --> 20:23.550]  Or if you just need CBD, find my friends at Medtree.
[20:23.550 --> 20:28.230]  Or if you need the high THC, grab yourself some Lemon Jeffrey, some SunKiss, or some
[20:28.230 --> 20:29.350]  Orange Gasm.
[20:29.350 --> 20:32.490]  The main problem is that you don't have a testing facility there.
[20:32.870 --> 20:35.530]  You're going to have to find the seeds that get your attention.
[20:35.530 --> 20:36.530]  You'll have to grow them.
[20:36.530 --> 20:41.650]  Then you will have to smoke each plant individually and see which one works best for you.
[20:41.650 --> 20:45.570]  And then just keep a clone of that and continue to grow that plant perpetually.
[20:45.570 --> 20:48.650]  Then you've got the medicine that works best for you.
[20:48.650 --> 20:52.650]  But without lab testing, you kind of have to do things the long way and the hard way,
[20:52.650 --> 20:59.050]  unfortunately, until you get out of prohibition land or until you change the laws around cannabis
[20:59.050 --> 21:00.570]  in your area.
[21:00.650 --> 21:04.890]  I feel like that was a really long answer to what could have been a simple answer.
[21:04.890 --> 21:09.450]  The answers are Lemon Jeffrey, SunKiss, Orange Gasm, and Jilly Bean.
[21:09.450 --> 21:14.290]  And then if those don't work for you, maybe try some CBD and experiment with the different
[21:14.290 --> 21:16.770]  effects of THC and CBD.
[21:16.770 --> 21:20.570]  And then since you've already bought some CBD tincture, why not combine them and see
[21:20.570 --> 21:22.170]  if it works better for you?
[21:22.170 --> 21:23.890]  Again, I'm not a doctor.
[21:23.890 --> 21:27.930]  This is just what I would do if I was trying to help a friend figure out what works best
[21:27.930 --> 21:28.930]  for them.
[21:28.930 --> 21:33.730]  If you were in Colorado, we would go to a dispensary and we would buy lab tested flowers.
[21:33.730 --> 21:37.610]  They would say, this one's got this much THC, this one's got this much CBD, and we would
[21:37.610 --> 21:41.870]  take you home and we would roll up a joint of each one and we'd smoke one and see what
[21:41.870 --> 21:43.130]  happens to you.
[21:43.130 --> 21:45.810]  Wait a couple hours, smoke the other one, see what happens to you.
[21:45.810 --> 21:47.290]  And I'd go, which one worked better, bro?
[21:47.290 --> 21:48.690]  And you'd go, this one.
[21:48.690 --> 21:50.250]  And we'd already have answers.
[21:50.250 --> 21:53.210]  Unfortunately, shit doesn't work that way in prohibition land.
[21:53.210 --> 21:55.490]  So we've got to go about it the long way.
[21:55.490 --> 21:57.650]  Hey, WAGs, I hope I was able to help you out.
[21:57.650 --> 22:00.970]  If you've got more questions, please send me a follow-up email.
[22:00.970 --> 22:02.810]  I do look forward to hearing from you.
[22:02.810 --> 22:06.930]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[22:06.930 --> 22:09.570]  and growers, all you bad motherfuckers out there.
[22:09.570 --> 22:12.170]  I think it is time for me to wrap up this episode.
[22:12.170 --> 22:15.330]  I am stoned and rambly and slightly out of focus.
[22:15.330 --> 22:18.490]  I've got some friends coming over here in a little bit, so I want to clean up, kind
[22:18.490 --> 22:19.970]  of get ready for them to hang out.
[22:19.970 --> 22:22.250]  I want to thank you for listening to this episode.
[22:22.250 --> 22:24.270]  I hope everybody learned something.
[22:24.270 --> 22:28.470]  If you've got a cannabis community, culture, or cultivation question, I would love to answer
[22:28.470 --> 22:30.030]  your questions on my show.

[22:40.750 --> 22:42.770]  25th and 26th.
[22:42.770 --> 22:48.550]  Make sure you've got your tickets and arrangements made now because the event will sell out.
[22:48.550 --> 22:49.750]  That's right, the Indow Expo.
[22:49.750 --> 22:52.710]  Find IRE Genetics at booth 533.
[22:52.710 --> 22:54.910]  Stock up on some fresh IRE Genetics.
[22:54.910 --> 22:55.910]  Take a selfie.
[22:55.910 --> 22:56.910]  Shake my hand.
[22:56.910 --> 22:57.910]  Introduce yourself.
[22:57.910 --> 23:01.750]  I would love to meet you at the Indow Expo in Denver.
