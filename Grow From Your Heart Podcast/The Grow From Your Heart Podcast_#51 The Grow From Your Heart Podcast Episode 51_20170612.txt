[00:10.170 --> 00:20.810]  Yeah, what's up cannabis community? It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your
[00:20.810 --> 00:25.810]  Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. If you're a new
[00:25.810 --> 00:30.290]  grower, a professional grower, a long time cannabis consumer, a brand new smoker, a cannabis
[00:30.290 --> 00:33.570]  activist, or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis, this
[00:33.570 --> 00:37.330]  my friends is the podcast for you. Thanks for joining us. I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:37.330 --> 00:41.810]  Man, I'm excited because across the table from me is one of my favorite people on this
[00:41.810 --> 00:46.490]  planet. She said she did not want to be on the podcast and then I talked her into it
[00:46.490 --> 00:50.890]  and Miss Angela is here. Thanks for coming. You can say hello now.
[00:50.890 --> 00:51.890]  Hello.
[00:51.890 --> 00:52.890]  Oh, you're so adorable.
[00:52.890 --> 00:56.210]  I wasn't supposed to say anything.
[00:56.210 --> 00:58.890]  She said she wanted to come hang out and not talk, but I put a mic in her face and I'm
[00:58.890 --> 01:02.610]  going to get her talking because she's a talkative chick. She's not feeling super well today.
[01:02.610 --> 01:06.170]  So I rescued her from work. We're going to give her some medicine. She's going to smoke
[01:06.170 --> 01:10.690]  some CBD herb on the show and we're going to kind of see if it makes her feel better
[01:10.690 --> 01:14.930]  while she's here. I think she took one hit off that bowl and she started to smile a little
[01:14.930 --> 01:19.010]  bit. So dude, thanks for coming, Angela. I really appreciate that. Over here to my left
[01:19.010 --> 01:22.250]  is this obnoxious dude. We got Clint Stewart. Tall Clint is back.
[01:22.250 --> 01:23.250]  What's up guys?
[01:23.250 --> 01:24.250]  Dude, thanks for coming, bro.
[01:24.250 --> 01:25.250]  Obnoxious already.
[01:25.250 --> 01:28.330]  Yeah. Well, that's how we like you, man. I like the show Obnoxious when you're here.
[01:28.330 --> 01:30.370]  You're going to lively up. She's, she's mellow over there.
[01:30.370 --> 01:34.850]  Is that the comments on the board is like, you know, what's great? Everything but Clint.
[01:34.850 --> 01:39.490]  No, people, people like you because not everybody is a cannabis expert. And since you're the
[01:39.490 --> 01:44.250]  new guy, you remind me to quit doing wheelies and to just ride with both wheels on the ground
[01:44.250 --> 01:47.850]  and teach you guys how to get your balance and go straight before we start doing backflips
[01:47.850 --> 01:48.850]  and shit.
[01:48.850 --> 01:52.170]  Yeah. Every once in a while you can do like a one hander, but yeah, but like, like let
[01:52.170 --> 01:57.210]  us, let us, uh, try to catch up to where you're at. Cause you're at a level what? 50 and I'm
[01:57.210 --> 01:59.570]  at a level negative one.
[01:59.570 --> 02:01.450]  I'm not going to call you negative anything, dude.
[02:01.450 --> 02:02.450]  For sure. For sure.
[02:02.450 --> 02:06.450]  I did, uh, I did see you take two hits off of a joint last night and for a whole car
[02:06.450 --> 02:08.490]  ride home, you were higher than giraffe pussy.
[02:08.490 --> 02:10.970]  It was great.

[04:01.170 --> 04:05.170]  about CBD medicine first so you can talk about Ari. All right, we're going to talk
[04:05.170 --> 04:11.610]  about Ari Shafir. I've introduced everybody. Uh, so last night my buddy Clint, well about
[04:11.610 --> 04:14.890]  a month ago my buddy Clint sent me a text message. He said, Ari Shafir comedy works
[04:14.890 --> 04:19.290]  January 30th. That's right. And I was like, fuck yes. Yeah. And a Clint and I have barely
[04:19.290 --> 04:23.050]  had time to even talk to each other over the past month. It's been four or five text messages.
[04:23.050 --> 04:28.730]  Merry Christmas. Happy new year. How you doing? And then that's about Ari still happening.
[04:28.730 --> 04:32.970]  It was like the most recent. And so, uh, I was so glad when he was like, fuck yeah,
[04:32.970 --> 04:36.650]  bro. And I was like, all right, be at my house at four and we'll do this. Yeah. My problem
[04:36.650 --> 04:40.970]  is it's, it's not Jeff. It's me. Cause I'm a, I just work too much. That's both of us.
[04:40.970 --> 04:46.970]  Jeff's busy too, but you know, it's just, I'm a, I'm a steel worker. I'm, I'm there all the time,
[04:46.970 --> 04:52.650]  all the time. Yeah. And dude, you work a week, days, a week of days, and then a week of nights
[04:52.650 --> 04:57.610]  and that would just drive my body insane. Yeah. We do a 12 hour shifts Monday through Friday.
[04:58.570 --> 05:04.170]  Seven to seven. And then, uh, so you're doing am to PM and then the next week you do PM to AM
[05:04.730 --> 05:09.130]  and then back and back and back. It's, you know, so you're just constantly trying to catch up on
[05:09.130 --> 05:13.210]  sleep. So I apologize for not coming and hanging out with your brother. It's understood. Uh, you're
[05:13.210 --> 05:17.770]  here now and we got to have tons of fun. Yeah. Tons of fun. So last night, Clint, Clint actually
[05:17.770 --> 05:22.650]  bought me a ticket to go see Ari Shafir. Uh, if you don't know Ari Shafir, he's on at midnight
[05:22.650 --> 05:26.650]  quite often. Uh, you got to watch at midnight. If you're into funny shit, he's got a show called,
[05:26.890 --> 05:31.610]  this is not happening on comedy central. He's got a Thursday nights. He's got a podcast,
[05:31.610 --> 05:36.650]  a podcast called the skeptic tank. It's great. And then he just put a special out on comedy central,
[05:36.650 --> 05:42.010]  yep. Uh, paid regular paid regular about his experience at, uh, coming up at the comedy
[05:42.010 --> 05:46.330]  store in Los Angeles, where most of our favorite comedians seem to have gotten their start. At
[05:46.330 --> 05:52.090]  least, at least went through there for a time. Yeah. I, I really enjoyed his comedy last night,
[05:52.090 --> 05:57.610]  man. He tore it up. So I have never seen or paid attention to Steve Simone on the way up. Clint
[05:57.610 --> 06:02.250]  told me that Steve Simone was the opening act. Dude, Steve Simone was amazingly funny. He's a
[06:02.250 --> 06:07.610]  mostly clean comic. He didn't, I don't think he ever said fuck. He might've, but I mean, it was
[06:07.610 --> 06:13.850]  in passing. I think it was something where it was, it was so fun. He just, he's a ball of energy
[06:13.850 --> 06:18.810]  and he's still in sixth or fifth grade. Yeah. You know what I mean? He pulls on his shirt. He's a
[06:18.810 --> 06:23.770]  35 year old sixth grader. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. It's kind of cute. It's adorable as a grown man
[06:23.770 --> 06:28.010]  watching him wiggle around all uncomfortable, but comfortable, you know, like, like he's got all
[06:28.010 --> 06:31.850]  that attention that he wanted, but now he's like, Oh shit, I've got the attention. And he starts
[06:31.850 --> 06:36.330]  wiggling, but he tore it up. He crushed, it was real fun. And then a shout out to Chris
[06:36.330 --> 06:41.610]  Sharp and tear for hosting that show too. That was great. He was hilarious. Yeah. Uh, I like that
[06:41.610 --> 06:46.010]  the openers get that short little set because then they just do that highlight set. Yeah. Get out of
[06:46.010 --> 06:49.850]  there. I think that's kind of smooth. Yeah. It's a good way to just show yourself off. Uh, and
[06:49.850 --> 06:54.890]  sharpened tears, a Denver guy. So, um, we're trying to get him to come down to Pueblo. That's
[06:54.890 --> 06:59.050]  sweet. We're trying to do stuff down here too. We're trying, I'm still, I'm still an open miker,
[06:59.050 --> 07:02.570]  but we put on shows every once in a while. It's just, you know, we're busy with work. So
[07:03.290 --> 07:08.490]  everybody's trying, but, uh, made some new friends last night. It was real fun, uh, at the Denver
[07:08.490 --> 07:12.170]  comedy works, which is our favorite club. My favorite club. Yeah, definitely my favorite
[07:12.170 --> 07:15.690]  comedy club on the planet. Yeah. So we got to make a whole bunch of friends and it was,
[07:15.690 --> 07:21.130]  it was a lot of fun. Just people gravitate toward my boy Jeff here. It's it's funny
[07:21.850 --> 07:25.930]  when you're six, five and have dreadlocks and a big cheesy smile. Cause I was high as shit the
[07:25.930 --> 07:30.330]  whole day when you're that high and having fun, people can tell they're like that guy's having a
[07:30.330 --> 07:34.250]  good time. We want to be his friend. Well, and they probably also wanted to be sitting front
[07:34.250 --> 07:39.850]  row. Like we were, you know, a humble, humble brag there. A big shout out to my buddy Baker
[07:40.490 --> 07:44.970]  from comedy works. He hooked us up with the preferred seating passes and I actually got a
[07:44.970 --> 07:48.490]  text message from him today saying, whenever we want that, just let him know. And those are our
[07:48.490 --> 07:54.650]  seats. He said we are unofficial regulars. We're like a B level regular at that club. Yeah. So
[07:54.650 --> 07:59.850]  whenever we want to sit there, those are our seats. Baker. You're my boy, dude. Ari, we want
[07:59.850 --> 08:04.570]  to give a huge shout out to Ari and Steve Simone. Those guys tore it the fuck up. I laughed my ass
[08:04.570 --> 08:09.370]  off. I've needed laughter is therapy. Uh, my life is stressful being a pot grower, uh, having so
[08:09.370 --> 08:13.770]  many friends, having an internet life. Uh, my shit is stressful. I balanced my stress pretty
[08:13.770 --> 08:19.370]  well, but comedy is my medicine, dude. Cannabis is my medicine. Comedy is my, my soulful release
[08:19.370 --> 08:24.810]  and music, but going to see comedy and laughing like that. I feel like I got refreshed. Yeah.
[08:24.810 --> 08:28.090]  Yesterday was hanging out with you. Of course, bro, that might've been part of the therapy,
[08:28.090 --> 08:31.930]  you know, you and I get to have a good conversation. Yeah. I mean, that's the thing with us
[08:31.930 --> 08:38.010]  is we don't even, there's what no time for music or anything on the way up. Cause we just hang out,
[08:38.010 --> 08:41.290]  turn the radio down and talk. Yeah. That's probably one of the better parts about not
[08:41.290 --> 08:46.170]  seeing somebody for a month though, is like everything's brand new. Yeah. So I could agree.
[08:46.170 --> 08:51.050]  I could agree. It was a great show. Um, I would recommend everybody go check out Ari Shaffir.
[08:51.050 --> 08:55.610]  Yeah. Check out Ari Shaffir support that guy. His t-shirts are 3d and they are awesome. Yeah. I'm
[08:55.610 --> 09:00.490]  wearing one right now. They're sweet. The sweetest t-shirt I've ever seen on a tour. Um, super quick
[09:00.490 --> 09:05.450]  shout out to our buddy Deacon Gray. Deacon Gray is experiencing throat cancer. He's been through
[09:05.450 --> 09:09.690]  all of his chemotherapies. He looks good. His spirits are up, but I still want to send you a
[09:09.690 --> 09:16.010]  big hug. Lots of comedic love. Deacon is a Denver comedian. Um, support Deacon Gray. I know you don't
[09:16.010 --> 09:19.610]  know who he is, but just send him a big fat, uh, jaw hug or whatever you believe in. Send him some
[09:19.610 --> 09:23.290]  vibes. Cause he needs your energy to get better over this cancer. Yeah. He's made me laugh. And
[09:23.290 --> 09:26.970]  I think since laughter is medicine, we need to return the favor to him. Yeah. He's come down to
[09:26.970 --> 09:31.610]  Pueblo down to Springs. He did a free show here. Yeah. That's it. So that's super cool. He came to
[09:31.610 --> 09:36.890]  our little, not super popular town that has a bad reputation and did a show for free. Yeah. And
[09:36.890 --> 09:41.530]  that's, that's awesome. He's a Denver guy. Why did he come here? Because he's awesome. All right.
[09:41.530 --> 09:45.290]  So shout out Ari. Thank you, dude. Thank you. And dude, thank you for the ticket. Yeah. Thanks for
[09:45.290 --> 09:53.450]  driving. That was like a champ dude. Yeah. Fuck you. I 25, I 25 can suck it sometimes. Yeah. But
[09:53.450 --> 09:57.930]  last night wasn't too bad. We got up there, hit a little rush hour, but it wasn't too bad. Not too
[09:57.930 --> 10:02.810]  bad. So I know my way to write two comedy works like, yeah, you did. I was thinking blindfold
[10:02.810 --> 10:06.410]  me and my car just goes there. It feels like that was so great. That was pretty great. All right.
[10:06.410 --> 10:10.170]  So Ari Shafir was awesome. That was, that's our point here, dude. If you guys get the chance,
[10:10.170 --> 10:15.610]  go check it out. Check out paid regular. Um, Ari would mind me saying this it's on the torrents,
[10:15.610 --> 10:20.250]  go find the extended version on a torrent site. Please get the extended version. Yeah. Don't
[10:20.250 --> 10:24.570]  check out the broadcast version. All right. Uh, the name change is official. You guys,
[10:24.570 --> 10:27.930]  this show is now called the grow from your heart podcast. I'm going to start trying to remember
[10:27.930 --> 10:32.890]  that all the time. It's not, I grow culture anymore. There's a new logo. Uh, the new artist
[10:32.890 --> 10:37.850]  posted, but Facebook and Stitcher are slow to update. They won't change. Stitcher won't change
[10:37.850 --> 10:42.890]  probably until I put up this episode. Uh, it's been the wrong artwork, the wrong show description
[10:42.890 --> 10:47.210]  for a week. And I've emailed them and they're like, we'll fix it, but that's free. So they
[10:47.210 --> 10:51.290]  don't give a shit. They're not going to fix it. Facebook will change my name February 4th. They
[10:51.290 --> 10:54.810]  have to verify that I am who I am because I'm a business and shit. And they don't want me just
[10:54.810 --> 10:59.850]  changing something. And yeah, so they're like, you get 14 days and that comes up February 4th. So
[11:00.650 --> 11:04.010]  that's all coming up. That's all official shit that I needed to say. The website,
[11:04.010 --> 11:10.090]  I read genetics, colorado.com. We have got, uh, shirts and happens and stickers on there.
[11:10.090 --> 11:15.770]  Uh, there are a bunch of black t-shirts in sizes, small through extra, extra large and white. And
[11:15.770 --> 11:19.610]  I think there are only about 10 I read genetics, hat pins on there. Those are going quickly. So
[11:19.610 --> 11:25.850]  grab those while you can, while you're there, join the forum on the website. Um, and also,
[11:26.810 --> 11:30.810]  um, I'm not trying to be a mooch, but there's a donate button on that motherfucker, right?
[11:30.810 --> 11:35.130]  On the, if you go to the podcast page, there's a donate button. If you donate, you can donate
[11:35.130 --> 11:40.010]  $1 up to however many you feel like, if you feel like this podcast was worth a couple of bucks of
[11:40.010 --> 11:43.690]  yours for my time and my effort, I would appreciate your donation. I'm not begging,
[11:43.690 --> 11:47.370]  but somebody said they would donate if I put that there. So it's there. Feel free to use it.
[11:47.370 --> 11:51.450]  You donate, it goes directly to my PayPal account. That's kind of, it helps me pay for the show
[11:51.450 --> 11:55.290]  because I do put in a lot of work to the show. Yeah. Still a free podcast though. So for, yeah,
[11:55.290 --> 11:57.690]  I'm never going to charge you. I'm never going to make you pay for anything. I'm just saying,
[11:57.690 --> 12:01.530]  if you feel like it was worth something and it's like a tip, you know, if you felt like you got
[12:01.530 --> 12:05.930]  good service, put in the tip. Yeah. Think of all the information this guy's given you just to be
[12:05.930 --> 12:10.810]  like, Hmm, I could probably give him a buck. Yeah. You know? Yeah. Dude, I got 5,000 listeners. If
[12:10.810 --> 12:15.770]  they all gave me a buck, uh, I would definitely buy new microphones. What's up 5,000 help us out.
[12:15.770 --> 12:19.290]  I'd buy new microphones for sure. And then, uh, my daughter's trying to go on an adventure in
[12:19.290 --> 12:24.090]  Hawaii and educational program. And until that happens, all of the money that goes into that
[12:24.090 --> 12:29.130]  donate button will go to her. I'll just straight send that to her. Go fund me for her, uh,
[12:29.130 --> 12:34.490]  her adventure in Hawaii, her educational adventure. So that's going to happen. That's rad. Yeah,
[12:34.490 --> 12:39.850]  guys. I know I did a bunch of giveaways on episode 50. Um, I'm still giving you time. If you haven't
[12:39.850 --> 12:43.850]  listened to episode 50, go listen to it. Learn how to win a bunch of bad-ass prizes from the
[12:43.850 --> 12:49.450]  garden of Whedon prizes from hydro indoor growing supplies, high prices from ivory genetics. There's
[12:49.450 --> 12:55.930]  a highly educated t-shirt. I plan on deciding my, uh, the winners around episode 52 or 53. Like I
[12:55.930 --> 13:00.570]  said, I make the rules. I'll decide when I see the right comment of what I did with, I don't even
[13:00.570 --> 13:03.930]  want to tell you how to win the prizes, but when I see the right one, the winner I'll go, that guy
[13:03.930 --> 13:09.530]  wins. I'll know it'll be by episode 53. I won't drag it out too long. All right. So Angela sitting
[13:09.530 --> 13:14.570]  across the table, looking all sweet. You look all red-eyed over there a little bit, a little bit.
[13:15.610 --> 13:20.250]  What strain are you smoking tonight? Uh, Canada, tonic Canada, tonic. Do you remember the numbers
[13:20.250 --> 13:29.770]  on that? Uh, I know it's 0.5% THC and like almost 15% CBD. Okay. So I'm going to kind of rewind and
[13:29.770 --> 13:33.370]  shout out to natural mystic cannabis caregivers in Colorado Springs. That's where we got this,
[13:33.370 --> 13:38.890]  uh, high CBD medicine. Um, Angela is one of my best friends. I know a lot about her and I'm going
[13:38.890 --> 13:42.570]  to try not to talk too much about her world. So if you feel like you need to slow me down and tell
[13:42.570 --> 13:45.930]  me not to say that or whatever, feel free to cut me off. I'm going to try to be completely respectful
[13:45.930 --> 13:48.570]  about this conversation, but it's your health that I'm talking about and it's your private
[13:48.570 --> 13:52.090]  shit. So interrupt me whenever you feel necessary and chime in when you want. Um,
[13:53.530 --> 13:57.770]  Angela used to dab with me like a fucking champion, dude. Angela used to smoke fat joints.
[13:57.770 --> 14:02.410]  She would roll joints, the size of my middle finger. And I've got a big middle finger and her
[14:02.410 --> 14:07.050]  and I would smoke them just to the dome. And then she'd roll another one and smoke. We'd smoke half
[14:07.050 --> 14:12.650]  of that and then put it out and smoke it later. So she was a heavy smoker. Um, one day she had a
[14:12.650 --> 14:18.650]  mean headache and somebody did the hippie pressure point where they squeeze between your forefinger
[14:18.650 --> 14:21.850]  and your thumb. There's a little spot in there that all your old hippie friends will tell you
[14:21.850 --> 14:26.010]  if you squeeze that and rub that a little bit, your headache will go away. So one of our silly
[14:26.010 --> 14:32.010]  hippie friends did that and she completely blacked out, uh, eyes did a little fluttering and she hit
[14:32.010 --> 14:38.330]  the floor. And when she came to, she was really disoriented and kind of groggy. And it's been
[14:38.330 --> 14:44.170]  labeled a seizure is what everybody, any medical person has called it. And so she went home. Uh,
[14:44.170 --> 14:47.530]  she got home from work and what's the first thing you want to do after that? You want to go fucking
[14:47.530 --> 14:51.530]  smoke a joint after you just had some traumatic shit like that happened to you. And she tried that
[14:52.250 --> 14:57.210]  and, uh, she told me that she felt like she was tripping. She's like, I'm hallucinating. I'm
[14:57.290 --> 15:02.010]  seeing shit. And she put a blanket over her head and laid down on the couch in the fetal position
[15:02.010 --> 15:06.890]  and wouldn't talk to me for like an hour. Yeah. She was hating life. And this is the girl that
[15:06.890 --> 15:12.330]  I've seen take half gram dabs and laugh at me. She used to make fun of Adam. We would smoke and Adam
[15:12.330 --> 15:16.250]  would tap out and want to go home. And she'd be like, come on, pussy smoke a joint. I smoked like
[15:16.250 --> 15:21.130]  two grams of wax to myself a day around about, I'm going to push the mic to you just a little closer.
[15:21.130 --> 15:24.250]  There you go. You're great. I'm just wanting you a little louder so we can hear you. She said that
[15:24.250 --> 15:28.650]  she used to smoke two grams of wax a day by herself and her and I hanging out together. We'd
[15:28.650 --> 15:34.890]  kill an eighth of hash in a day, just on a normal day, just her and I smoking. Yeah. Yeah. So she
[15:34.890 --> 15:39.290]  went home and smoked one joint or one dab or whatever, and was freaking out. And she thought
[15:39.290 --> 15:42.890]  maybe it's just today, you know, she gave it some time and went about her life, but she still had a
[15:42.890 --> 15:47.530]  headache and didn't feel right. And so she smoked more weed. And every time she would smoke weed,
[15:47.530 --> 15:51.370]  she would just get ridiculously high. It was like hanging out with a high fifth grader.
[15:51.370 --> 15:54.330]  You're like, you got to tuck her in and get her something to eat. And I'm not talking shit. Like,
[15:54.330 --> 15:59.210]  it's really what was happening to her. She went from a pro to Clint. Yeah. Just we had to babysit
[15:59.210 --> 16:03.290]  her when she would get high and she'd get super anxious, a lot of anxiety from smoking weed.
[16:03.290 --> 16:07.530]  So we found a few strains that would work better. The platinum OG was working well. And the girl
[16:07.530 --> 16:12.010]  scout cookies was getting her too high, but it was the kind of a more comfortable high for it.
[16:12.010 --> 16:16.090]  Seemed like so she didn't feel really, it was, it's been about a month and she really did not
[16:16.090 --> 16:21.290]  feel good a few days ago. It's been about a week, right? Yeah. And she felt like shit. She didn't
[16:21.290 --> 16:26.010]  this only happen a week ago. Oh no. Uh, the part I'm getting into now that this was probably a
[16:26.010 --> 16:30.650]  month or two ago when the seizure incident happened and the longer than that, it's been like three
[16:30.650 --> 16:34.570]  months now. Okay. I'll agree with that. I only know because I like really want to get high.
[16:34.570 --> 16:40.010]  Like I used to. Yeah. Yeah. Like I do. It's affecting her. It's kind of, it's affecting
[16:40.010 --> 16:47.290]  a lot. Like even when I'm not smoking, my anxiety is just super shitty. Yeah. And not being able to
[16:47.290 --> 16:51.850]  submit, she obviously you'd kind of Jones for some smoke because it's a ritualistic. It's not
[16:51.850 --> 16:55.210]  just wanting to get high. Her and I used to pass a joint back and forth and lay around and smoke a
[16:55.210 --> 17:00.730]  joint together. It was like, it just feels good. It feels good to get stoned and smoke and like
[17:00.730 --> 17:05.050]  being sick and not being able to smoke the medicine that she relied on. It's driving her
[17:05.050 --> 17:10.570]  crazy. I can fucking see it. It's making her kind of grouchy. So we go in, we call my friend, Joey
[17:10.570 --> 17:13.930]  at natural mystic cannabis caregivers about a week ago. And I'm like, Hey bro, do you have any high
[17:13.930 --> 17:18.170]  CBD? And he said, I sure do. Come on up to the shop. We'll get you set up. I wish I could remember
[17:18.170 --> 17:22.970]  the bud tender's name. She was beautiful. She was super helpful. And I would hire her if I owned a
[17:22.970 --> 17:27.450]  shop any day that girl knew about cannabis. She had great skills. I wish I remembered your name
[17:27.450 --> 17:30.570]  because she was awesome. I don't know that she'll ever listen to this, but she deserves a shout out.
[17:30.570 --> 17:36.330]  So we go up there and we get the CBD medicine and we got canna tonic, canna, Sue and Torah Bora,
[17:36.330 --> 17:42.970]  and they're all super high CBD strains. And we got Taurus, you actually, okay. Okay. Thank you.
[17:43.610 --> 17:47.930]  Uh, but we get, we get to the car. I'm trying to be discreet here, but we got to the fucking car
[17:47.930 --> 17:52.410]  and she wasn't going to wait. She rolled up the joint and she started smoking it. And she got
[17:52.410 --> 17:56.650]  about halfway through the joint. And I looked over like you're smoking like a lot of weed over there
[17:56.650 --> 18:00.730]  for someone that has panic attacks or smoking weed. And she looked at me and she goes, I am
[18:00.730 --> 18:09.210]  high and smiled about it. And I was like, Oh, Oh shit. Okay. And it's working. Yeah. It was definitely.
[18:09.210 --> 18:13.770]  So for myself, I've smoked a lot of CBD cannabis and I've written it off because it didn't seem to
[18:13.770 --> 18:18.410]  really do anything for me. It didn't do, I want to get high when I smoke pot. I want to feel
[18:18.410 --> 18:22.330]  that cycle of that psychedelic. It's slightly, I don't even know what to call it. Head change. I
[18:22.330 --> 18:26.250]  want to be fucking high. I want to get high when I smoke weed and CBD doesn't do that. So I've
[18:26.250 --> 18:30.010]  written it off. If they're like, this is a high CBD strain. I'm like, well, I'm not going to smoke
[18:30.010 --> 18:33.930]  it. I'll let you smoke it. Cause you have pain, enjoy it. Cause I'm just wasting that dab or that
[18:33.930 --> 18:41.050]  joint. And so I know it's helpful for patients, but watching her, it changed our entire day. Just
[18:41.050 --> 18:47.610]  she smoked that joint and half of another one. And then I smoked half of one with her and I had
[18:47.610 --> 18:51.690]  taken a couple of dabs. We stopped to smoke on the drive and I, we pulled over and got out and did a
[18:51.690 --> 18:55.850]  little hike and shit. And I took a couple of dabs. But then after I smoked that joint, it felt like
[18:55.850 --> 19:00.490]  my dab high was kind of diminished. It was like, nah, you're not as high as you used to be. And I
[19:00.490 --> 19:05.770]  was like, why am I getting mellow? But it made me higher for a really long time. And we got
[19:05.770 --> 19:11.770]  giggly. We both got kind of, and I don't get giggly from smoking weed, but smoking that joint of CBD
[19:11.770 --> 19:16.570]  after a couple of dabs changed, uh, dabs don't give me an eye high. When I miss, when I smoked
[19:16.570 --> 19:20.250]  weed back in the day, my eyes would get all droopy and I'd be like, damn, I'm stoned. Dabs don't do
[19:20.250 --> 19:26.090]  that to me, but the CBD weed totally put that back. It did that. So I think I'm missing something when
[19:26.090 --> 19:30.250]  I'm dabbing. I think I need to smoke more flowers. And I think I also need to incorporate more CBD.
[19:31.370 --> 19:35.210]  Excuse me. I'm getting clogged up. Yeah. Do you feel like a CBD is like a, like a,
[19:36.490 --> 19:41.930]  not, not to call marijuana, like a hard drug or anything, but do you feel like CBD is a drug
[19:41.930 --> 19:48.730]  unto itself? Like THC is what drug and then C CBD is a drug. Um, like you, like when you get your
[19:48.730 --> 19:53.930]  tolerance going for THC, maybe that's not the same tolerance you would have for CBD. It's a different
[19:53.930 --> 19:58.170]  compound. Yeah. So it's affecting a CBD receptor instead of a THC receptor, which is also a
[19:58.170 --> 20:01.850]  cannabinoid receptor, but it's going to affect you differently. Yeah. Well, that sounds like
[20:01.850 --> 20:06.410]  something that, that people should be aware of. Like, no, it's not just marijuana. It's like,
[20:06.410 --> 20:11.770]  no, you need to kind of know what's in that or what style it is. Because now we're going to focus
[20:11.770 --> 20:18.570]  on finding her a lot of CBD medicine because she's been taught, uh, how far through that bowl are you
[20:18.570 --> 20:23.370]  about halfway now? Uh, more than that. I have like a hit or two. Clint's been here for 30 minutes.
[20:23.370 --> 20:26.570]  And is she a different person from when you got her? Yeah. You were laying on the couch in the
[20:26.570 --> 20:29.930]  dark and now you don't even have the sunglasses on. Yeah. She seems like you're doing all right.
[20:29.930 --> 20:33.530]  Yeah. So it's helping you. It's making your headache go away. You're you look better. You
[20:33.530 --> 20:36.810]  don't look like you're trying to hide from the world. You know, when you don't feel good,
[20:36.810 --> 20:39.370]  you guys, you know, when you don't feel good, you just want to hide. You put your hoodie on and you
[20:39.370 --> 20:42.890]  try to curl up into a little ball. Like you can actually almost disappear if you try hard enough.
[20:42.890 --> 20:48.490]  Yeah. But your kids always find you and it sucks. All my customers today thought I was high because
[20:48.490 --> 20:53.290]  I was so, my headache was so bad. My eyes were squinty and they're like, man, you must be stone
[20:53.370 --> 20:57.130]  as fuck today. Oh yeah. Angela's the bud tender over at the spot dispensary. Shout out to the
[20:57.130 --> 21:01.690]  spot dispensary in Pueblo West Colorado. The spot for high society. Stop in and say, what's up to
[21:01.690 --> 21:10.570]  this cute little dreadlock girl. She's beautiful. Yeah. She's blushing. Oh, how cute. Yeah. Check
[21:10.570 --> 21:15.370]  it out though. That's a nice spot. That's the only, the spot's the only, uh, uh, marijuana
[21:15.930 --> 21:21.370]  store that I've been to because, uh, normally I have other contacts where I can get marijuana
[21:21.370 --> 21:27.050]  from, but it was a very nice store. I like the people in there. They were all super helpful,
[21:27.050 --> 21:32.810]  had no problem finding what I needed to find. Um, I liked it. That was a nice store. It's a cute
[21:32.810 --> 21:36.090]  little shop. Check it out. Uh, it's under construction in the grow area. And as soon
[21:36.090 --> 21:39.850]  as it's ready, there will be some Rasta Jeff growing happening in there. That's what I'm
[21:39.850 --> 21:43.930]  excited about. Yeah. I get in the whole world excited about that. How much of that have you
[21:43.930 --> 21:50.410]  talked about so far on the show? Yeah. Um, not much because we haven't, um, I don't, it's not
[21:50.410 --> 21:56.250]  my business yet. If that makes any sense, all your headphones cut out sometimes. It's not my
[21:56.250 --> 22:00.970]  business yet to be talking about really. I feel like we haven't talked about what I can say. I
[22:00.970 --> 22:07.930]  can say that there are, uh, over 200 lights and that it's hydro and that the rooms are fucking
[22:07.930 --> 22:11.850]  awesome. Like I've been in a lot of grows, a lot of big grows. And when I walked in there, I went,
[22:11.850 --> 22:16.250]  damn, you guys did this shit, right? Yeah. Like there's a showroom. You open these two
[22:16.250 --> 22:19.530]  swinging doors. I don't know if it's double doors or one door. It's a huge fucking door. You open
[22:19.530 --> 22:25.130]  it and you walk in and there's a showroom that's the grow rooms are glass so that you can see into
[22:25.130 --> 22:31.210]  two rooms and the water room. Yeah. So there will be, they plan to do like visual tours and shit.
[22:31.210 --> 22:36.890]  Oh, I'm down. Yeah. Get me on that. I just want to go look. Yeah. That's awesome. So that, that
[22:36.890 --> 22:40.730]  part of them, I know I can say because that's hyping it up. We want to advertise that. So I'm
[22:40.730 --> 22:44.010]  saying that's happening, but I don't know what else I can say. I'm the grower there. I'm growing
[22:44.010 --> 22:48.970]  man. Colorado's just cool. Yeah, it is. Yeah. Uh, I'm hoping to do a lot of things with there.
[22:48.970 --> 22:54.330]  I've got ideas. They've got ideas. We just need to agree. I feel you, man. Yeah. So she's backing
[22:54.330 --> 22:58.970]  up another bowl over there about of that CBD. Has it been other than today? Has it been helping you?
[22:58.970 --> 23:03.770]  I know today was an extra stressful shitty day for you. Uh, this week really hasn't been like as
[23:03.770 --> 23:11.050]  bad as the last like three months have been for sure. Um, I'm pretty sure if I smoked this before
[23:11.050 --> 23:16.330]  work that I would have felt better than that. You wouldn't have had to bail out halfway through.
[23:16.330 --> 23:21.050]  Yeah, pretty much. So why would you do that? I don't want to be at work. Let me out of here.
[23:22.250 --> 23:27.610]  Luckily, uh, she works with the person that did the hippie fucking hand technique and he's kind
[23:27.610 --> 23:31.450]  of sympathetic still. So you should play that card whenever you can. I'll be like, you're the
[23:31.450 --> 23:39.050]  one who did it to me. Asshole. You're damn hippie magic. Damn Vulcan hand grip. That's basically
[23:39.050 --> 23:44.010]  what it is. I'm going to take a dab while you want to hit that bowl. I take a dab. Clint's not smoking
[23:44.010 --> 23:48.570]  this evening. Clint's up. I got to drive here pretty soon and I'm not, uh, I'm not capable of
[23:48.570 --> 23:52.810]  smoke this with me. It won't get you high. You know what? I'm just, it's a Saturday night and
[23:52.810 --> 23:56.730]  there's a UFC fight and there will be police everywhere where you're headed. Yeah. So I'm
[23:56.730 --> 24:01.850]  just gonna chill out and hang out with the listeners. Maybe you guys are smoking. Maybe
[24:01.850 --> 24:07.130]  you're not. Um, I think that's the best part about this, uh, podcast is it's just information,
[24:07.130 --> 24:12.410]  you know, and they, Jeff's doing a good job of trying to make it a fun and educational. I know
[24:12.410 --> 24:17.850]  you're making educational, um, finding that borderline. That's, that's the tough part is
[24:17.850 --> 24:22.890]  because you guys can ramble on about a lot of stuff, but that's like you said earlier is maybe
[24:22.890 --> 24:28.250]  I'm the guy that, because I don't know a lot about this stuff, even the questions between, uh, CBD and
[24:28.250 --> 24:32.890]  THC, like, I just don't know. Yeah, I guess I should talk more about CBD. Um, I don't have a
[24:32.890 --> 24:36.090]  book or I'm not even gonna pull up a website. I'm just going to kind of spat out of my head.
[24:36.090 --> 24:43.210]  Uh, CBD is a cannabinoid. Uh, I think it's pronounced cannabidiol. Um, it's works more
[24:43.210 --> 24:48.810]  as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory. It's known to have antibacterial properties.
[24:48.810 --> 24:54.170]  It's really well known for, and this is a good segue. It's really well known for stopping people
[24:54.170 --> 24:59.290]  who have tremors and seizure type disorders or conditions. I won't even call it a disorder.
[24:59.290 --> 25:03.050]  That's a condition calling it a disorder makes it sound like you're fucking condemned or something.
[25:03.450 --> 25:09.050]  Uh, this, uh, people with seizure conditions. So I was telling a random story that I will tell on
[25:09.050 --> 25:15.450]  this show in a second. I was telling a story to a friend who was a paramedic and she said that CBD
[25:16.410 --> 25:24.170]  stops an electrical firing in your brain that causes seizures. So that is awesome. Yeah. And so
[25:24.170 --> 25:29.850]  it, that's going to be really helpful for anybody with seizures. Uh, CBD definitely makes me hungry.
[25:29.850 --> 25:34.410]  That's why I'm not smoking that bowl. It's like my first or second hit off a CBD. My stomach goes.
[25:36.170 --> 25:40.890]  So if you've got some cancer and you're not eating from the chemotherapy, dude, smoke some,
[25:40.890 --> 25:47.690]  uh, can of tonic, that stuff makes me starve. Like we went to lunch and then smoked right after lunch.
[25:47.690 --> 25:52.570]  And I was like, well, you got to go back in there. Yeah. When I'm full, I'll get hungry
[25:52.570 --> 25:56.410]  from smoking the can of tonic. Yeah. That stuff just makes you want to eat. Um,
[25:57.370 --> 26:02.010]  it made my, I can play guitar longer. I've noticed that I got a new guitar for Christmas and I've
[26:02.010 --> 26:06.170]  noticed if I play too long, my wrists and my forearm fingers hurt. I don't, I can just keep
[26:06.170 --> 26:11.450]  going now. And I may just be building up endurance, but I don't feel any pain from it. I would cramp
[26:11.450 --> 26:16.970]  up after a while. I know I'm not. So this CBD stuff is instead of like the head high that I
[26:16.970 --> 26:22.090]  normally get where I'm just flying through the cosmos. Now it's more of a body high. Is that
[26:22.730 --> 26:28.570]  what you're saying? You would probably experience a body high because you're really low tolerance to
[26:28.570 --> 26:33.290]  any first cannabinoids, but people that have smoked a little bit, it just goes straight to
[26:33.290 --> 26:37.050]  pain. I feel like it knows where the pain is. It's like, Oh, your arm hurts. I'm going to drive right
[26:37.050 --> 26:40.490]  up to your arm. I'm going to park here, let out my little CBD paramedics. And we're going to work
[26:40.490 --> 26:44.810]  on your arm or your head or your neck and shoulders. Cause she's had a lot of weird
[26:44.810 --> 26:48.490]  symptoms lately. Sorry. I cut off my description of what kind of biddy all is, but it's a
[26:48.490 --> 26:52.890]  cannabinoid. It's the opposite of THC. It's the one that goes down instead of up. And it's,
[26:52.890 --> 26:58.490]  I think it tastes like cherries. I definitely think that a lot of herb that has CBD in it and
[26:58.490 --> 27:04.170]  extracts made with CBD, they often have a cherry, um, like a cherry halls, cough drop or a Luden's
[27:04.170 --> 27:09.050]  kind of a taste to it. That's what I've always thought of CBD. I'm high in random. I've talked
[27:09.050 --> 27:13.050]  about how it affects me. It makes me hungry. It made me really mellow. It made me kind of smiley,
[27:13.050 --> 27:18.010]  like put a grin on my face, like a giggle. And then, uh, here's a really, uh, a random story.
[27:18.010 --> 27:24.330]  You ready for this one over there? Oh gosh. I know where this is going. Yeah. So, uh, we had
[27:24.330 --> 27:28.650]  a long day. We went to Springs and bought some cannabis, which is an hour drive away. We went
[27:28.650 --> 27:36.730]  to lunch and then we came home and like two beautiful people do we, uh, we got naked and,
[27:36.730 --> 27:43.690]  um, we're both loving what we were doing. Um, and after about an hour of us giving it to each
[27:43.690 --> 27:50.170]  other, I kind of looked at her like, um, I love what you're doing, but I'm never going to finish.
[27:50.170 --> 27:56.410]  Like, this is perfect. You've done everything I love and this is not going to happen. Like
[27:56.410 --> 28:00.010]  nothing's wrong. And she kind of looked at me like me too. And I'm going to embarrass you,
[28:00.010 --> 28:04.570]  but it usually doesn't take much for her to be done. Like she gets three to my one. Cause she's
[28:04.570 --> 28:08.490]  a girl and I'm not complaining, but I mean, I didn't even see one. She's obvious when it happens.
[28:08.490 --> 28:13.530]  I didn't see one. And I was like, well, she's not either. And so she goes, I think that CBD,
[28:13.530 --> 28:17.770]  and I was thinking it right. As she said it, she goes, I think that CBD weed killed it.
[28:17.770 --> 28:22.730]  And it was the whole time it was happening. It was like, I was almost there. So it was fucking
[28:22.730 --> 28:29.450]  amazing the entire time, but it just wouldn't, there was no, no grand finale there. And I was
[28:29.450 --> 28:34.490]  like, it's not you. And she's like, it's not you. So we, so I talked to my paramedic friend and she
[28:34.490 --> 28:41.130]  said that that same electrical firing in your brain that causes a seizure is the same one that
[28:41.130 --> 28:47.450]  causes you to orgasm. And by smoking CBD, you pretty much just turn that sucker off. And she
[28:47.450 --> 28:52.010]  said that opiates will do it times 10. She's like, good luck getting a boner on opiates. I was like,
[28:52.010 --> 28:56.890]  huh? I've never really, I'm not really into opiates. She said it just straight turns off
[28:56.890 --> 29:01.690]  that electrical firing mechanism in your brain to where you'll never come. Never like she said,
[29:01.690 --> 29:06.250]  you probably could, but like, you know, it's going to take a lot more effort than what I,
[29:06.250 --> 29:08.170]  I really like her. I didn't want to try that hard.
[29:10.010 --> 29:14.170]  Like a gallon of sweat later. Yeah. My legs were sore and I was kind of sweaty.
[29:14.170 --> 29:18.970]  And I'm hungry. Yeah. It was like, you're cute as fuck. And this is great, but I'm going to
[29:18.970 --> 29:24.330]  take a brain check, you know, like, can I do that before that's whiskey dick for me though? Yeah.
[29:24.330 --> 29:29.530]  No, I guess I'm not finishing today. I had CBD dick dude. It was, it was working, but it just
[29:29.530 --> 29:36.250]  wasn't, you got that CB deck. There's been a few times you won't even smoke my CBD weed for that
[29:36.250 --> 29:42.330]  reason. Well, yeah. He's like, Hey, uh, I'm not going to smoke that wink wink.
[29:45.290 --> 29:49.290]  Honestly, part of the reason I don't smoke it is because we bought a limited supply and I don't
[29:49.290 --> 29:53.210]  need to waste it. It doesn't do much for me other than make me hungry and not make me nuts. So
[29:53.210 --> 29:58.170]  what's the price comparison on it? You know, that dispensary is very completely fair and it's,
[29:58.410 --> 30:03.050]  they have three different price points of that herb and it averages at $200 an ounce,
[30:03.050 --> 30:06.970]  but it's a medical only shop. Oh, I feel you. Yeah. So you have to have a medical card to get
[30:06.970 --> 30:11.850]  in there, but $200 an ounce is a very good price because she works at a dispensary. And did you
[30:11.850 --> 30:19.370]  sell an ounce today? No, we barely ever, because it's like five 60 out the door or something after
[30:19.370 --> 30:26.090]  taxes and everything. Yeah. You have to buy a little white bag that locks to even carry your
[30:26.090 --> 30:30.330]  ounce out in. It's like the first accessory you didn't even like you're going to, because you have
[30:30.330 --> 30:33.610]  to have that to leave the dispensary because that's childproof. That's how the dispensary
[30:33.610 --> 30:40.490]  watches their ass. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. That's weird. I didn't know that. That's so they actually have
[30:40.490 --> 30:45.210]  to sell you that bag or that's kind of like given with the five 60. Uh, that's with the five 60,
[30:45.210 --> 30:48.570]  but they could, some dispensaries charge you for that. Is that what the five 60?
[30:48.570 --> 30:54.490]  Um, well we have the childproof bottles and then we are supposed to charge for the bags for
[30:54.490 --> 30:58.730]  edibles. But most of the time we just give them to people because they're buying a lot of stuff.
[30:58.730 --> 31:04.330]  Yeah. Recreational is expensive. They stock up at that shop. The people really like to stock up when
[31:04.330 --> 31:10.010]  they come. It's fun watching them shop. People are mesmerized guys. Come to a dispensary. If you're
[31:10.010 --> 31:14.410]  from another state, drive out to Colorado, uh, go to the spot dispensary. If you're coming from the
[31:14.410 --> 31:18.650]  South, go to the spot. If you're up North, dude, um, go to like, I don't even know who to tell you
[31:18.650 --> 31:23.050]  to up North. I'll find a good spot and I'll recommend them soon, but come to the spot in
[31:23.050 --> 31:28.410]  Pueblo West Colorado, check it out. They've got such cool shit in there. They've got like 25
[31:28.410 --> 31:33.770]  strains of herb on the shelf. If you've never been in a dispensary and somebody shows you 25 jars
[31:33.770 --> 31:38.410]  full of cannabis, you're going to smell every single one of them. The bud tender is going to
[31:38.410 --> 31:42.330]  start tapping their foot cause they've seen them all, but just, just, just, just look at every one
[31:42.330 --> 31:45.450]  of them and enjoy them. I'm sorry. I'm doing that to you. I know you're the bud tender and I'm
[31:45.450 --> 31:49.210]  telling them to do that, but enjoy it. Check that shit out, dude. Spoiler yourself the first time.
[31:49.530 --> 31:54.250]  Go look. It is so freaking neat. Like I remember the first time I went into a weed store. It's
[31:54.250 --> 31:58.970]  amazing. And I'm from here. Yeah. Well, either that or save yourself some money and start growing
[31:58.970 --> 32:03.130]  your own hair. I'll make up for telling them to take all day. The bud tenders do accept tips.
[32:03.130 --> 32:07.450]  There's a tip jar on the counter. Make sure you toss some shit in there. Big tips. It's only 600
[32:07.450 --> 32:12.970]  bucks for an ounce out the door. Most people are from out of state and they can only buy a quarter.
[32:13.450 --> 32:20.650]  They drove all the way here. Yeah. Just to, I mean, I, that's, I, I'm a, I'm an open mic comedian.
[32:20.650 --> 32:25.370]  I'm sure if anybody's heard me before, they, they know how unfunny I am most of the time, but
[32:25.370 --> 32:29.850]  I'm not trying to say I'm a comedian. I'm just saying I'm an open miker, but that's like one of
[32:29.850 --> 32:35.370]  my big things is just how cool Colorado is compared to everybody else around us. God,
[32:35.370 --> 32:42.730]  it must suck being from Utah or Wyoming or Kansas or New Mexico. Yeah. I hear,
[32:42.730 --> 32:49.850]  I hate Texas at least 15 times a day. My customers are probably 50% of the customers
[32:49.850 --> 32:55.290]  seem like they're from all from Texas. Yeah. They hate, they hate Texas cause they have to drive
[32:55.290 --> 33:01.450]  from there just to get legal weed. That's ridiculous. Yeah. It's changing though, man.
[33:01.450 --> 33:06.810]  The world's changing. Yeah. Oh, guys do what you can, where you are to get cannabis legalized in
[33:06.810 --> 33:10.810]  your area so that you don't have to drive all the way to Pueblo, Colorado to come by an eighth for
[33:10.810 --> 33:15.690]  like 70 bucks. Speaking of, uh, uh, like, uh, people making changes. I wanted to give a shout
[33:15.690 --> 33:21.370]  out to our buddy Mike for holding it down at the city council stuff. Uh, appreciate it. Neil punk,
[33:22.090 --> 33:27.210]  you're really kicking ass, man. I appreciate it. He does 12 hour days, 13, 14 hour days,
[33:27.210 --> 33:30.570]  just so that he's able to get to the city council meetings. I think he got to work at six the other
[33:30.570 --> 33:34.970]  day and finally got home from city council at 10 30. So however many hours that is Mike's putting
[33:34.970 --> 33:39.770]  them in for us so that we can grow so that we can smoke so that we can do what we do here and not
[33:39.770 --> 33:45.210]  feel like criminals again in our, in our local area. Yeah. And the seven one nine. So shout out
[33:45.210 --> 33:48.330]  to Mike. That's a good, thanks for reminding me of that. Well, weren't you saying something? We
[33:48.330 --> 33:52.170]  were driving up yesterday. We got talking and I asked how's Mike. He said, well, we, they got this
[33:52.170 --> 33:55.450]  kind of thing going on and they were talking about, uh, like your backyard stuff. Do you want
[33:55.450 --> 34:00.730]  Mike in here to talk about that better or like how a city council is trying to make it to where we
[34:00.730 --> 34:04.570]  can have less plants in our backyard or something like that? Yeah. Uh, well, we've kind of talked
[34:04.570 --> 34:09.450]  about a little bit of that on the show. Uh, city council is trying to limit us to like six plants
[34:09.450 --> 34:14.330]  per household. Then you have to grow it in an out building, not attached to your house. And Mike
[34:14.330 --> 34:19.370]  and I Mike mostly, but since I know a lot about growing, I was able to contribute a lot, but Mike
[34:19.370 --> 34:23.850]  wrote pages and pages and pages on why that's ridiculous. And he's been going to every, he goes
[34:23.850 --> 34:30.250]  to the, um, planning and zoning, uh, the city council, city commissioners, any meeting that he
[34:30.250 --> 34:34.810]  can sit in and go, this is why that shit's bullshit. And he shows up and puts it and he's
[34:34.810 --> 34:39.290]  working at like a 45 hour a week job doing construction too. So he's putting it in and
[34:39.290 --> 34:44.170]  he's doing, he's actually building grows for the Denver bud company. That is so cool. All day long.
[34:44.170 --> 34:50.010]  He's cannabising in some way or another, but just thanks Mike. We appreciate it. Uh, if you're on
[34:50.010 --> 34:54.810]  Twitter, follow Mike, what's he? Neopunk Nemo punk. And then there's numbers after it. Um,
[34:55.690 --> 35:03.210]  yeah, well, 27 something. Yeah. 53. Yeah. Uh-huh. It'll be in the show notes for sure. Yeah.
[35:04.170 --> 35:06.970]  I'll look at my Twitter. You know what? Follow me. I'm following him.
[35:08.010 --> 35:11.370]  I'm not even going to say mine now. I'm over it. It's too slow.
[35:14.250 --> 35:19.210]  Oh, can we talk about the weed brain I got on the way up there? My goldfish goldfish brain. Oh,
[35:19.210 --> 35:23.850]  my goldfish memory. Cause I have such a low tolerance. We smoked before we, I smoked here.
[35:23.850 --> 35:29.130]  I smoke one hit and this is the funniest thing to me because I know it's going to happen.
[35:29.130 --> 35:35.450]  And I want to hold a conversation with people, but I, I smoke one hit off of my little pipe and
[35:35.450 --> 35:40.810]  I am like 30 seconds. I'm like, what was I talking about? And it's every 30 seconds.
[35:40.810 --> 35:45.210]  It's hilarious too. It is hilarious, but I know what's happening. So I tell Jeff like, yeah,
[35:45.210 --> 35:49.050]  I just don't remember what we were talking about. And he's like, dude, it was four seconds ago. And
[35:49.050 --> 35:52.650]  I'm like, I just don't remember. I'm sorry. We get off on these tangents. I get excited.
[35:53.370 --> 35:56.730]  There was a pause at one point when we were driving, I don't remember who was talking,
[35:56.730 --> 35:59.930]  but there was a pause and we looked at each other and I just go, I don't remember.
[36:01.930 --> 36:07.290]  It was just an unspoken. I don't know. So, uh, it's gone. So if you're trying to hold a
[36:07.290 --> 36:12.970]  conversation or if you're trying to be a, the cool guy, maybe marijuana, like for the first time,
[36:12.970 --> 36:17.850]  isn't the right thing to do. And I wasn't even planning on smoking at the show. I was just like,
[36:17.850 --> 36:21.370]  ah, we'll get back to the car. I'll smoke in the car and we'll head back. But then when
[36:21.370 --> 36:25.850]  Ari Shaffir passes the joint to it's like, well, you know, I probably should. Yeah.
[36:26.250 --> 36:28.970]  You were silent until we got to the gas station to get gas.
[36:29.610 --> 36:33.850]  I was looking out the window, just enjoying, just thinking of like, oh man,
[36:34.890 --> 36:39.850]  ah, it was so pretty out too. And then what I think I said, one thing I could Denver's so pretty.
[36:39.850 --> 36:44.010]  Yeah, that was it. Yeah. It was, it was a beautiful night in Denver. I couldn't ask
[36:44.010 --> 36:51.290]  for a better evening other than those horses. So Jeff, uh, my boy Jeff here has had nightmares
[36:51.290 --> 36:55.930]  and he's, uh, he's afraid of horse drawn carriages. That's true. That's true. He let
[36:55.930 --> 37:00.810]  me know this. So every time a horse drawn carriage was coming our way, I just punched
[37:00.810 --> 37:06.090]  that horse right in the face. Tell it, get out of here. Yeah, no, there was, there were board,
[37:06.090 --> 37:10.410]  there were boundaries drawn. And if that horse got that far, then that was when the punch would
[37:10.410 --> 37:15.050]  come. But luckily you never had to drop that. Or I really wanted to see you just fucking sucker
[37:15.050 --> 37:19.210]  punch it. Goddamn giant horse. That would have been so great. I was just going to a Conan that
[37:19.290 --> 37:25.850]  horse just boom. It's not a Tuma. I know what would have been a good tagline after you punch
[37:25.850 --> 37:34.410]  a horse. I don't know. Uh, I'll think not on my watch. Something really random. Not on my watch.
[37:34.410 --> 37:41.530]  I don't know any like horse names like secretariat. Uh, I got nothing man. Okay. I,
[37:41.530 --> 37:46.970]  the Kentucky Derby of dropping horses over here. The honest truth. Uh, I lived in Santa Fe, New
[37:46.970 --> 37:52.170]  Mexico for a short period of my time of my life. And I had a dream, a nightmare that on the plot,
[37:52.170 --> 37:56.170]  well, this actually happened on the Plaza in Santa Fe. There are horse drawn carriages
[37:56.170 --> 38:00.410]  carrying yuppie folk around all the time, just on dates and shit. And they got like Christmas
[38:00.410 --> 38:04.090]  lights and candles on them and shit. And they're all snazzy. I had a dream one night that I was in
[38:04.090 --> 38:10.410]  my car and I could see this horse drawn carriage up the road, crossing the street. And I just could
[38:10.410 --> 38:16.090]  not stop. I was only going like normal speed. I wasn't going over 45 or 50 in my dream, but my
[38:16.090 --> 38:23.770]  car and I were like, stop, Nope, stop. Nope. And I plowed into the horse drawn carriage with people
[38:23.770 --> 38:29.210]  in the carriage and it was chaos and it scarred me, bro. I woke up. Oh no, I'm sorry. I didn't
[38:29.210 --> 38:33.210]  mean to kill the horse. And so now when I see the horse drawn carriage and I'm driving, I'll
[38:33.210 --> 38:38.170]  fucking turn left and go somewhere else, dude. Like they can just ramble on and I'll backtrack.
[38:38.170 --> 38:42.010]  I'll be back when you're not around. Yeah. There was a lot of them. A lot of them last night in
[38:42.010 --> 38:45.690]  Denver. That part of like the 16th street mall loves horse drawn carriages. Hey, uh, speaking
[38:45.690 --> 38:51.850]  of which yoga pants and Ugg boots. That was, that was the nice, like the uniform. Yeah. Horses and
[38:51.850 --> 38:59.450]  yoga pants is crazy, dude. I didn't know what to think. Um, stretch them out. Stretch them out.
[38:59.450 --> 39:03.930]  One size fits all apparently. The hole for the tail. Yeah. It was pretty cool. No, uh, what was
[39:03.930 --> 39:07.850]  the place we ate at that pizza place? Oh, uh, the mellow mushroom. Hey, uh, shout out to the mellow
[39:07.850 --> 39:14.490]  mushroom. That was yummy. So delicious. So the dankness. Thanks guys. Yeah, dude, that was a
[39:14.490 --> 39:18.090]  great trip. Thanks for, uh, thanks for making that happen. That was your fault. Hey, uh, you drove,
[39:18.090 --> 39:24.010]  man. I appreciate you driving. There's no way I can get high and drive. I'm not seasoned. There's
[39:24.010 --> 39:29.210]  no way I didn't get high and drive. I didn't say you did. I said I got high before we left. I took
[39:29.210 --> 39:33.930]  like six dabs and I didn't get high and drive. Yeah. Don't drive high, please. Like that's,
[39:33.930 --> 39:39.530]  that's it. Don't drive high. No, you know, you know your limits. Well, then we got talking about
[39:39.530 --> 39:45.770]  why Jeff doesn't drive when he's like cashed. That's because, uh, Jeff's kind of an ambassador
[39:45.770 --> 39:51.610]  for, uh, as I see it, like with this podcast and stuff like that, you're trying to make
[39:52.490 --> 39:59.370]  weed as acceptable as possible. And you know, yes, you look like a hippie. I mean, you both got dreads,
[40:00.810 --> 40:08.650]  but you don't need to be making the classic mistakes that every stoner movie like showcases.
[40:08.970 --> 40:13.930]  Oh, he's so stoned that he can't get off the couch or always seeing six shades of gray or
[40:13.930 --> 40:19.130]  something like that because he smoked himself colorblind or some shit. I don't know. It's just,
[40:19.130 --> 40:24.090]  yeah, it's the dude. Where's my car effect where everybody's an idiot. What kind of brought it up
[40:24.090 --> 40:29.610]  was there was traffic was going crazy up ahead of us and I wasn't sure what happened. And I said,
[40:29.610 --> 40:34.490]  uh, pay attention to which, which way the turn signals go. And Clint found that to be some sort
[40:34.490 --> 40:39.850]  of genius fucking observation because that the mile ahead I can see the turn signals flicker in.
[40:39.850 --> 40:43.210]  And I know if I need to start going left or right now, cause I'm just going to copy the turn signals
[40:43.210 --> 40:46.970]  and I'll be in the proper lane instead of fighting for it when I get up there. Yeah. Getting cut off
[40:46.970 --> 40:53.050]  by two Priuses was not cool. That you weren't supposed to talk about that on the show. I was
[40:53.050 --> 40:58.090]  passed by a fucking Prius and it felt very emasculating. You have a soccer bomb car though.
[40:58.090 --> 41:07.690]  You're asking for it. That's true. That's true. It's a Prius dude. I know that was the best part.
[41:07.690 --> 41:12.330]  Anyway. So yeah, turn lights, turn signals are going on up ahead and I was just stoned enough
[41:12.330 --> 41:17.530]  to go, Oh, that was really smart, man. Yeah. And that's what that, I was like, well, I got to pay
[41:17.530 --> 41:22.010]  extra attention and be more, a little more on top of it because I've got dreadlocks to my ass. I'm
[41:22.010 --> 41:26.570]  wearing an ivory genetics, Colorado cannabis t-shirt. The car reeks of dink, even though the
[41:26.570 --> 41:32.650]  herb is in the back of the car, in the backpack, in a bag, it just reeks. I look like a pothead and
[41:32.650 --> 41:35.770]  I don't want to be pulled over on the side of the road in a wreck. And they're going, look at this
[41:35.770 --> 41:41.610]  stupid pothead. High as shit did something dumb. I don't want that because I will scar the community.
[41:41.610 --> 41:45.530]  I feel like, and this is what kind of brought this up. I feel like I kind of represent, I've chosen
[41:45.530 --> 41:49.530]  to represent the community, not just myself. There are a lot of us that do it, but I'm one of the
[41:49.530 --> 41:54.410]  people that have chosen to speak out and put myself in the spotlight for cannabis. And I need to be
[41:55.210 --> 42:01.130]  a, not a malnourished, too skinny dude. I need to not be the cliche on the couch guy. I need to not
[42:01.130 --> 42:06.090]  be fucking the red eyed in every picture that you see. Well, that's why I got sunglasses on
[42:06.090 --> 42:09.690]  all the time. And that's what I wanted to, I kind of want to bring that up. So that way, maybe some
[42:09.690 --> 42:13.770]  of our friends who are taking the red eye pictures, maybe there'll be like, Oh, you know what?
[42:13.770 --> 42:18.090]  Maybe the, maybe the cliche stoner isn't really what we want to be showcasing to
[42:18.650 --> 42:25.610]  a middle America, white America who doesn't, I mean, I'm a cracker. It's just, you know,
[42:25.610 --> 42:30.490]  and for the longest time it was, it was, it was something where weed was dangerous because we're
[42:30.490 --> 42:35.130]  indoctrinated with that through dare and all this stuff. Yeah. Well, back in the day and the,
[42:35.130 --> 42:39.930]  they taught us that the Mexicans and the black jazz musicians would smoke weed and rape white
[42:39.930 --> 42:43.850]  bitches. Yeah. It was, you'd turn into a demon and rape the white women. Yeah. It was what they
[42:44.410 --> 42:49.290]  for madness. It's what we're taught propaganda and people, my grandparents, like they, they were
[42:49.290 --> 42:52.650]  smart enough to go wait, that's bullshit. But they're, they had friends that were like, your
[42:52.650 --> 42:57.050]  kids are smoking weed. And we're never even going to be your friends again. Cause like my grandparents
[42:57.050 --> 43:02.570]  raised cool ass kids that were all potheads. Like I got, uh, three uncles and two aunts and my mom,
[43:02.570 --> 43:06.970]  and they were all potheads until their adulthood life. And some of them still smoke. Some of them
[43:06.970 --> 43:10.410]  gave him what up just cause my mom can't smoke anymore. She gets so fucking stupid when she
[43:10.410 --> 43:14.810]  smokes weed. Yeah. But I mean, that's the thing. That's the thing with weed is there. Isn't that
[43:16.010 --> 43:20.170]  me and my buddy, Paul, Paul Rosales, uh, he's shut out Paul. What's up, bro. What's up, buddy.
[43:20.810 --> 43:26.250]  He's probably at home. Yeah. Wild cousins. Check out wild cousins. Um, no, we, uh, we were talking
[43:26.250 --> 43:31.530]  about it the other day and there's no, uh, like with heroin, you get sick if you try to quit
[43:32.410 --> 43:37.930]  and with meth and all these terrible drugs and, and, but marijuana for the longest time was in
[43:37.930 --> 43:43.610]  that same category. Like everybody thought that that's a, Oh, it's, it's all the same,
[43:43.610 --> 43:48.970]  you know, but nobody talks about like, Oh, I can go into a seven 11 at any time, uh,
[43:49.930 --> 43:57.930]  before 2.00 AM and go buy as much alcohol as I can fit in my car. Yep. And no, that's okay.
[43:57.930 --> 44:04.490]  Because the big business park and drink it on your boat. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're completely allowed
[44:04.490 --> 44:12.250]  to. I mean, you could, I, I've been sober from alcohol for eight years and I had to quit. I had
[44:12.250 --> 44:16.410]  to quit because I had a real problem with it. Fortunately, I didn't get withdrawals when I
[44:16.410 --> 44:22.330]  decided to quit, but I do know people that do get shakes at all. I don't remember. It's been so long
[44:22.330 --> 44:26.650]  ago. You're just over it. And I was forget that, but I was literally 22 years old when I quit
[44:26.650 --> 44:32.090]  drinking. Wow. Yeah. Well, I mean, when you started at like 14, but that was the thing is
[44:32.090 --> 44:36.810]  you could get alcohol. Alcohol was, you could get it. It's just like cigarettes were back in
[44:36.810 --> 44:40.250]  the day. It was just like weed was when it was illegal. You could get weed. Yeah. Never going
[44:40.250 --> 44:46.650]  to stop you from getting what you want. Yeah. But I don't remember the dare officer being like, dude,
[44:46.650 --> 44:51.050]  alcohol is the one you got to be watching. Oh, they put fucking, if you look at alcohol
[44:51.050 --> 44:55.690]  commercials, they make you think that if you drink dos Equis, you are the most interesting
[44:55.690 --> 44:59.610]  man in the world. I don't always drink dos Equis, but when I do, or I don't always drink alcohol,
[44:59.610 --> 45:05.050]  but when I do, I get two chicks, I get a boat, I get a cool ass dog. Someone throws a party.
[45:05.050 --> 45:09.690]  Yeah. Like all this balloons happen and shit. I'm beautiful. Like fucking just cause I drank
[45:09.690 --> 45:14.410]  some dos Equis. Yeah. But, but on the opposite hand, like anytime that you're smoking weed,
[45:14.410 --> 45:18.250]  you're the stoner that sits on the couch and you're just so typecast is that. And I think
[45:18.250 --> 45:24.090]  that's such bullshit. Yeah. So I wanted to give you a shout out Jeff for being a good representation
[45:24.170 --> 45:30.250]  of, uh, uh, cannabis culture. Thank you, bro. That's cool. Hopefully, uh, some people on the,
[45:30.250 --> 45:36.490]  on the other end of this podcast will agree with me. Um, I'm absolutely positive they do because
[45:36.490 --> 45:43.290]  after I posted episode 50, my email and social media feeds have exploded with people saying,
[45:43.290 --> 45:48.890]  thank you for this show. Uh, dude, you guys, you overwhelmed me. You made me like,
[45:48.890 --> 45:51.930]  I don't even know there's a feeling in my heart. I don't even know what to call it,
[45:51.930 --> 45:55.690]  but there's this big bright white light that goes around my chest area when I think about it.
[45:55.690 --> 45:58.010]  And my friends in this room can see it in me when I'm talking about it right now,
[45:58.010 --> 46:02.090]  cause I'm like wiggling. You do get excited to have that many people email me and go, dude,
[46:02.090 --> 46:06.170]  we're fucking proud of you. And your show is awesome. Like I'm overwhelmed and super excited.
[46:06.170 --> 46:12.570]  Yeah. Congratulations on 50, by the way. I know 51 51. Yeah. And I got Angela on 51. She said she
[46:12.570 --> 46:19.130]  never wanted to be on the podcast. Yeah. Yeah. I blurred, we blurred you with weed,
[46:19.530 --> 46:26.650]  fucking hippies. We're all the same. Yeah. I wanted you to be here when I told the story
[46:26.650 --> 46:31.210]  about us not being able to finish our sexual escapade because I want to do your respectful
[46:31.210 --> 46:35.050]  about it. And I would have to play the episode for you and let you edit out anything you didn't like
[46:35.050 --> 46:40.650]  anyway. So you kept us on track and kept it nice. So I'm glad you came for that part. How do you
[46:42.170 --> 46:47.290]  do like how's the store? That's why I love her.
[46:48.090 --> 46:50.570]  How, uh, how's the store treating you? Do you like working there?
[46:52.410 --> 46:57.290]  Sorry, I was thinking of hit. Um, yeah, I like it. Uh, she can't say she fucking hates it. No,
[46:57.290 --> 47:02.730]  no, no. I really like working there. Uh, recreational is definitely a lot different
[47:02.730 --> 47:09.130]  than working medical. Uh, the novelty like definitely wears off kind of quickly. And then
[47:09.130 --> 47:13.770]  it just becomes a job a little bit, but it's still, um, when people come in for the first
[47:13.770 --> 47:19.370]  time and they're really excited, that like makes it all worth it. Yeah. That's pretty cool. I don't,
[47:19.370 --> 47:26.010]  I'm, I can't really complain. I sell weed all day from previous meals or the drink I just took,
[47:26.010 --> 47:30.330]  but yeah, I wish I wouldn't have found that. Uh, I go hang out at the spot. Sometimes I'll show up
[47:30.330 --> 47:34.650]  with food or sometimes a boss will just have random questions and I'll pop in and I don't want
[47:34.650 --> 47:38.730]  to leave when I get there. Cause it's fun. It's everyone's just hanging out and selling weed and
[47:38.730 --> 47:42.570]  having a good time. Oh, it's a nice place. They're sweeping and cleaning and shit. But I mean, you
[47:42.570 --> 47:46.010]  can bullshit with me while you're sweeping and cleaning and there's, it's fun there. It's a good
[47:46.010 --> 47:51.290]  atmosphere. Yeah. And the crew is all like family too. We all get along and a little too well. Yeah.
[47:51.290 --> 47:58.250]  A little too well. We're silly as shit. I hope everyone's listening. I look forward to getting
[47:58.250 --> 48:03.050]  in there. Yeah. Yeah. Like I totally over took over your answer, but I look forward to getting
[48:03.050 --> 48:08.010]  in there because it looks so much fun. Do you have a favorite product from there? Is there
[48:08.010 --> 48:14.890]  something that you would recommend as a, as a, Oh yeah, that stuff's awesome. Um, the apothecary
[48:14.890 --> 48:19.850]  lotion. I make Jeff rub me with that all the time. Cause my shoulders are always killing me.
[48:20.410 --> 48:25.690]  And that stuff is the shit, the extra stream. I was skeptical of it. I didn't believe it would work.
[48:25.690 --> 48:32.410]  And then, uh, one time I rubbed her down with it and it made my hands all fluffy. Nice. Yeah.
[48:32.490 --> 48:36.410]  It definitely makes a difference. Shout out to apothecary, the Grammy Gatsby.
[48:37.370 --> 48:41.450]  And so that's something that's see, that's just stuff that it's like, it's so it's a lotion.
[48:41.450 --> 48:46.970]  Yeah. It's a lotion. It's a topical. It doesn't get you high, but it definitely is really relaxing
[48:46.970 --> 48:51.610]  for your muscles and everything. And I definitely deal with a lot of neck and back pain and that
[48:51.610 --> 48:57.370]  helps a lot. Right on. I put it on my knee and it helps my bum knee a little bit and makes it
[48:57.370 --> 49:01.370]  not hurt when it gets cold. My knee hurts and I rub some of that on there and it won't hurt no more
[49:01.370 --> 49:06.330]  anymore. I said no mo. Can you pick that up on the recreational side as well as the medicinal
[49:06.330 --> 49:11.610]  side? Yes, you can. See, these are the questions that need answers. This is why we brought Clint.
[49:11.610 --> 49:15.210]  Yeah. Awesome. Good question. Let's see how long we've gone. I need to look and see how long we're
[49:15.210 --> 49:19.130]  doing. We're just chatting here. I'm not even paying attention. 49 minutes. Yeah. Okay. I had
[49:19.130 --> 49:24.490]  some news articles. I think that'll be episode 52. We'll just, uh, save those. There's no need to,
[49:24.490 --> 49:31.930]  to get into the bunch of news. Um, my news is that, uh, February 21st, we're doing a, uh,
[49:31.930 --> 49:37.370]  benefit show at the downtown bar in Pueblo, Colorado. Um, I'm not sure if there's a cover.
[49:37.370 --> 49:41.850]  I'm sure there is a cover, but I don't remember what it is. Um, but I'm on early. I'm on it like
[49:42.410 --> 49:47.290]  three o'clock in the afternoon. Uh, we do comedy first and then they're going to do bands after
[49:47.290 --> 49:54.810]  that. Um, so you pay maybe five bucks. It's a benefit show. Um, February 21st. Who are we
[49:54.810 --> 50:01.850]  benefiting? That is for pops. Oh, for pops. Yeah. Cool. What's up pops benefit you, bro. We'll, uh,
[50:01.850 --> 50:05.450]  the girlfriend, your heart podcast. We'll try to figure out some way to contribute to that.
[50:05.450 --> 50:09.690]  Yeah. That's I read genetics and team. I will have to do something because I did pops is,
[50:10.330 --> 50:15.130]  uh, I used to grow specific CBD medicine for pops back in the day.
[50:15.450 --> 50:18.890]  I just got to grab my phone real quick. Clint's going to grab his phone. I think he's got a note
[50:18.890 --> 50:24.010]  in there or something. He's got some notes. Um, so February 21st in Pueblo, Colorado,
[50:24.010 --> 50:27.210]  the downtown bar, there are going to be a lot of comedians. I think I've seen something about this,
[50:27.210 --> 50:31.050]  but, uh, I see so many things on Facebook that I, my brain doesn't absorb all of them.
[50:31.050 --> 50:34.810]  Uh, downtown bar, there's going to be a lot of good music. There'd be a lot of good comedians
[50:34.810 --> 50:39.050]  get down there, support pops. Pops has been a staple of the Pueblo community for a long time.
[50:39.050 --> 50:43.050]  Uh, if you're from Pueblo and you've ever been to any drinking establishment and you've had to
[50:44.010 --> 50:48.890]  deal with that old guy outside with the grovelly voice that checks your ID, let me see your ID.
[50:48.890 --> 50:54.730]  That's pops. That's pops, you know, pops, and he's helped somebody to not get your,
[50:54.730 --> 50:57.850]  to not kick your ass at one point in your life. If you've been to the bar pops has been the
[50:57.850 --> 51:01.210]  bouncer and the security guard. And there's always that one asshole in the bar that wants to fight
[51:01.210 --> 51:06.330]  and pops will protect you. So shout out to pops. He's a, he had, he had lung cancer, so he needs,
[51:06.330 --> 51:10.090]  we need some help for that, dude. Clint get to your notes. I'm rambling about pops for a long
[51:10.090 --> 51:16.890]  time now. Yeah, sorry. All right. So it is, uh, February 21st at the downtown bar music and comedy
[51:17.610 --> 51:25.290]  and show starts at like two, 2 PM and I'm going to be on maybe like three o'clock, but it's, uh,
[51:25.290 --> 51:29.690]  the comedians, I'm just going to talk about the comedians cause there's so many guys coming down.
[51:29.690 --> 51:36.650]  Let's hear them. Uh, Dan Rainey, uh, myself, Paul Rosales, Matt Chapman. What up Maddie?
[51:36.730 --> 51:41.130]  John Brown. What's up John Brown. Wade Ridley, Charlie McMullen. I can't shout them all out if
[51:41.130 --> 51:46.890]  you go that fast. Well, they're all there. I'm sorry. You've got, you said go fast. That was,
[51:46.890 --> 51:51.370]  but that's, that's like a really good group. That is a good, very good group of funny guys. And I'll
[51:51.370 --> 51:55.610]  be on. So, I mean, you even get a smoke break. Look at all the funny guys you get to play with.
[51:55.610 --> 52:00.170]  That means that you're actually funny. No, it's all those dudes are quality comedians. Every one
[52:00.170 --> 52:06.090]  of those guys has funny shit. Yeah. None of those guys are hacks. Uh, I, I have, that's my favorite
[52:06.250 --> 52:10.010]  thing about Southern Colorado comedy on Facebook about a local comedian being a hack and every
[52:10.010 --> 52:14.970]  comedian in Pueblo thought I was talking about them. The people that you just listed are not
[52:14.970 --> 52:20.010]  the hacks. No, those people tell jokes they wrote. No, no, that's, that's the thing. I hope they all
[52:20.010 --> 52:26.410]  heard that Southern Colorado comedy is, is really pushing forward with our own senses of humor. Um,
[52:26.410 --> 52:30.250]  you, you might not like me, but you're going to like one of the guys on that. Or you're going to
[52:30.250 --> 52:34.570]  like one of the people on that. We've got a lot of friends. We're all friends. And that's my
[52:34.570 --> 52:40.410]  favorite thing about the comedy, uh, culture is it is, it is kind of like a weed culture. I mean,
[52:40.410 --> 52:46.010]  they go hand in hand almost is because everybody knows everybody. Uh, we went up to that show.
[52:46.010 --> 52:49.930]  You knew people that knew people. There was people, our waitress was like, do you know this
[52:49.930 --> 52:53.770]  person? Now I kind of know this person though. But, and they know that person. So it was,
[52:53.770 --> 52:59.530]  it's just a community. And so it was great. Uh, that Chris Sharpentier, I told him, I was like,
[52:59.530 --> 53:03.370]  dude, we need to get you down to Pueblo because he had been scheduled down once, but he couldn't
[53:03.370 --> 53:07.690]  make it that night. Uh, but that was one of my favorite shows. That was David Borey came down
[53:07.690 --> 53:12.570]  with Sam talent and it was great. And Byron Graham. So shout out to everybody that's comes
[53:12.570 --> 53:18.330]  down to Pueblo. We're really trying to work hard. Um, every second and fourth Thursday,
[53:18.330 --> 53:24.170]  we're at the rainbow bar on Santa Fe doing an open mic. Um, trying to promote that we did one this
[53:24.170 --> 53:29.850]  last week and it was, it's so fun. It's such a great place for comedy. So I hope everybody can
[53:29.850 --> 53:33.610]  come out and check it out. Support local comedy. You guys, even if you're not in Pueblo, there's
[53:33.610 --> 53:38.010]  comedy where you are. And if you're an aspiring comedian, start the scene, do it. That's right.
[53:38.010 --> 53:41.130]  All it takes is you to go stand somewhere and tell some jokes and invite some friends to come.
[53:41.130 --> 53:46.010]  Listen, get four or five people, make a little comedy showcase at the bar. Every slow night,
[53:46.010 --> 53:50.330]  Wednesday nights are good for it. The bar is dead. Thursdays. I mean, we're on, on Thursdays
[53:50.330 --> 53:55.370]  because we don't want to compete with a downtown bar every Wednesday. Um, but you know, we do the
[53:55.370 --> 54:00.010]  second and third or the second and fourth Thursday, we're going to be at the rainbow bar.
[54:00.010 --> 54:05.850]  And I just, I'm hoping people can come out. It's a free show. Free, free show. Super fun. And free
[54:05.850 --> 54:11.770]  fun. The guys I'm working with are so funny. It's ridiculous. Super free fun comedy night. It just
[54:11.770 --> 54:18.410]  became some Asian commercial. Super free fun comedy night. All right. And it got racist.
[54:19.850 --> 54:23.930]  That didn't, it lasted an hour without that for comedians. That's not bad. You know?
[54:23.930 --> 54:28.890]  All right. So we're back. I don't know. I'm not going to edit that. We're good.
[54:29.850 --> 54:34.250]  It felt the, you said how comedians are friends. It felt like once we hung out with Ari for just
[54:34.250 --> 54:38.650]  a couple of seconds, it just seemed like just some other dude. Oh yeah. Yeah. We smoked out
[54:38.650 --> 54:42.490]  with Ari in the alley and it didn't even seem like we're smoking with a celebrity. He just
[54:42.490 --> 54:46.810]  smoked weed and he's like, all right guys, I gotta go. It had some phone texting going on.
[54:46.810 --> 54:50.570]  I think he had some booty call to go 10 too. And he was out. Yeah. And he was just a nice guy. I
[54:50.730 --> 54:54.730]  mean, there was literally a couple of minutes there where nobody was talking and everybody gets
[54:54.730 --> 55:00.090]  so, uh, amped around like celebrities, but I really do feel like Ari Shaffir is a celebrity.
[55:00.090 --> 55:05.210]  He's put in so much work to get to where he's at and his special was so good. And his special just
[55:05.210 --> 55:09.610]  came out. So, you know, you would have thought like all these guys that listened to his podcast
[55:09.610 --> 55:13.210]  would have been all upon his nuts, but everybody was just kind of like, yeah, we're just, you're
[55:13.210 --> 55:18.090]  just a guy and that's how he acts. And he has a sweet sweater on. He didn't like hearing about,
[55:18.090 --> 55:21.050]  I listened to your show, man. It's great episode, whatever was awesome. He's like, cool, thanks.
[55:21.050 --> 55:24.890]  Let's talk about weed. He just fucking, I don't want to talk about me anymore. Like it was kind
[55:24.890 --> 55:28.650]  of neat. Like he didn't care. He's like, I'm just a dude, man. Well, yeah. And then you,
[55:28.650 --> 55:32.410]  I did too. Cause I told him that, uh, if you get a chance, if you're going to listen to that
[55:32.410 --> 55:38.010]  skeptic tank, uh, was it two Oh two with, uh, Ali's yeah. Yeah. Two Oh two. I think,
[55:38.010 --> 55:42.810]  Oh, that was such a good episode. So check that one out. Yeah. If you're going to listen to the
[55:42.810 --> 55:47.210]  Ari Shaffir skeptic tank, listen to the episode that is titled paid regular. Let's start with
[55:47.210 --> 55:52.410]  that one. I think that's one of the best. I think that's episode two Oh one sweet, maybe 200, but
[55:52.970 --> 55:57.450]  200 was a couple of his comedy buddies. Yeah. That was really funny too, though. Danish and
[55:57.450 --> 56:00.890]  whatever. All right. Sorry to tell you to go listen to something else. Listen to it. It's good
[56:00.890 --> 56:05.770]  from your heart podcast. You got to support other people. Miss Angela, you got any things you want
[56:05.770 --> 56:12.410]  to say to the world before we wrap up the show here? Um, no, I don't have much to say.
[56:12.410 --> 56:18.890]  Look at an extravagant message of peace and love for everybody. Um, insert extravagant message of
[56:18.890 --> 56:23.850]  peace and love here. And if you're going to try to insert anything, don't smoke too much CBD medicine.

[59:02.520 --> 59:22.080]  I can't understand. There's something about a girl. There's something about a girl.
[59:22.080 --> 59:27.680]  She confusing me. I don't know what she think or what she do to me. First she treat me like a king
[59:27.680 --> 59:32.800]  and then she threw with me. But truly I give her love and every day cause it's my duty even if she
[59:32.800 --> 59:42.320]  kind of moody. Right? She make you a king. When you do her right, you're back to suffering. When
[59:42.320 --> 59:54.240]  she puts up a fight. What's a boy to do with her instabilities? Make every day new. Try to keep
[59:54.240 --> 01:00:02.240]  your sanity. There's something about a girl. You can't understand.
