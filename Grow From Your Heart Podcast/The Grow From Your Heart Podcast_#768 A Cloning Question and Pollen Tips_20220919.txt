[00:01.080 --> 00:20.320]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:20.320 --> 00:23.160]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:23.160 --> 00:28.060]  This is episode 768 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:28.060 --> 00:31.680]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of grow questions before we get to that part
[00:31.680 --> 00:32.680]  of the show.
[00:32.680 --> 00:37.040]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who continue to support the show
[00:37.040 --> 00:38.560]  on Patreon.
[00:38.560 --> 00:42.360]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to one of
[00:42.360 --> 00:45.280]  my favorite growers, my buddy Root305.

[01:24.800 --> 01:31.360]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:31.360 --> 01:34.120]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:34.120 --> 01:38.200]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:38.200 --> 01:42.280]  it nice and easy for all of my friends to support the show.
[01:42.280 --> 01:46.000]  Speaking of Patreon, I am working on a Patreon special episode.
[01:46.000 --> 01:51.080]  I do not try to leave any grow material out on Patreon so I do special content on Patreon.
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.500]  I am planning an episode where I'm going to eat a heavy dose of edibles and ask questions
[01:55.500 --> 01:56.500]  about myself.
[01:56.500 --> 02:00.160]  That's right, I ask the patrons to contribute questions that they've always wanted to know
[02:00.160 --> 02:01.160]  or ask.
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.240]  I've gotten a lot of great feedback already.
[02:03.240 --> 02:05.760]  That episode is in the works, it is being planned, being written.
[02:05.760 --> 02:07.760]  I'm compiling questions.
[02:07.760 --> 02:12.240]  I encourage you to join the Patreon campaign and send me your questions and stay tuned
[02:12.240 --> 02:16.360]  for the episode that will be coming out on the beginning of next month so stay tuned
[02:16.360 --> 02:17.360]  for that.
[02:17.360 --> 02:18.740]  But join us on Patreon.
[02:18.740 --> 02:23.620]  Look forward to the episode where I eat too many edibles and try to answer questions about
[02:23.620 --> 02:25.760]  myself that the patrons have sent in.
[02:25.760 --> 02:28.700]  So check that one out, that will be coming out next month.
[02:28.700 --> 02:34.900]  Before I get too far, I do want to give everybody a big thanks for 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[02:34.900 --> 02:35.900]  I do appreciate it.
[02:35.900 --> 02:36.900]  That was a big push.
[02:36.900 --> 02:38.620]  We got a lot of great folks supporting us.
[02:38.620 --> 02:40.780]  There are 10,000 people subscribed.
[02:40.780 --> 02:41.780]  Thank you.
[02:41.780 --> 02:43.100]  I do appreciate each and every one of you.
[02:43.100 --> 02:45.640]  If you're not already subscribed to the show, please do.
[02:45.640 --> 02:46.860]  Click that subscribe button.
[02:46.860 --> 02:48.700]  Also click that notification bell.
[02:48.700 --> 02:51.420]  Every time I put out a new episode, you will get a notification.
[02:51.420 --> 02:53.340]  You will not miss any episodes.
[02:53.340 --> 02:56.820]  Also there are 768 episodes of this podcast.
[02:56.820 --> 03:00.140]  I hear a lot of times, hey bro, I wish you'd put out more content.
[03:00.140 --> 03:01.940]  We miss you doing two shows a week.
[03:01.940 --> 03:06.740]  There are 767 more episodes that you could go back and listen to that if you haven't
[03:06.740 --> 03:10.420]  heard all of them, I do encourage you to go back and listen to the old content.
[03:10.420 --> 03:12.460]  There's a lot of great stuff in there.
[03:12.460 --> 03:16.700]  Still a lot of great grow knowledge, grow information, grow tech to learn.
[03:16.700 --> 03:20.940]  Even if the episodes aren't completely current, that info is still completely useful.
[03:20.940 --> 03:24.900]  Also a lot of people do laugh and enjoy watching the older shows, going back and seeing how
[03:24.900 --> 03:29.580]  the show has evolved, how my approach to podcasting, how the gear, how everything has
[03:29.580 --> 03:30.580]  evolved.
[03:30.580 --> 03:32.340]  My point is, go watch a lot of the old episodes.
[03:32.340 --> 03:36.060]  I've been noticing that some of them have been getting more views and more clicks.
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.060]  Thank you for that.
[03:37.060 --> 03:40.900]  Once again, thank you for 10,000 subscribers on the YouTube.
[03:40.900 --> 03:43.140]  I feel like that is enough rambling here at the top of the show.
[03:43.140 --> 03:45.420]  I did say that I was going to answer grow questions.
[03:45.420 --> 03:48.540]  I've got a couple of great emails right here in front of me.
[03:48.540 --> 03:50.180]  This one comes from my friend Kip.
[03:50.180 --> 03:51.580]  Big shout out to my buddy Kip.
[03:51.580 --> 03:52.580]  It goes a lot like this.
[03:52.580 --> 03:54.180]  It says, what's up Rasta Jeff?
[03:54.180 --> 03:55.180]  What's up Kip?
[03:55.180 --> 03:56.180]  Good to see you.
[03:56.180 --> 03:57.180]  Thank you for the Patreon support.
[03:57.180 --> 03:58.320]  Thank you for the great question.
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.140]  It says, I've got a quick question for you.
[04:00.140 --> 04:04.980]  I was wondering, in your experience, what is the best practice for flipping into flower
[04:04.980 --> 04:06.620]  after taking clones?
[04:06.620 --> 04:08.260]  That is a very good question.
[04:08.260 --> 04:12.100]  Kip goes on to say, I typically wait a couple of weeks so I can make sure my roots or my
[04:12.100 --> 04:17.300]  cuts root, but I've been getting nearly 100% rooting success lately.
[04:17.300 --> 04:21.900]  The funny part about that is as soon as you get too confident and you do flip your plans
[04:21.900 --> 04:24.700]  early, that's when you're going to have rooting problems.
[04:24.700 --> 04:25.700]  I'm not trying to curse you.
[04:25.700 --> 04:27.220]  I'm not trying to jinx you.
[04:27.220 --> 04:29.460]  That is the way that the grow gods do treat us.
[04:29.460 --> 04:30.860]  So be very careful with that.
[04:30.860 --> 04:35.520]  It goes on, it does say, is there a timeline you should wait to flip after taking cuts
[04:35.520 --> 04:40.260]  or can you take a cut from a healthy plant and then go straight into flower?
[04:40.260 --> 04:43.500]  I'm doing a fairly large pheno hunt right now of 36 plants.
[04:43.500 --> 04:44.500]  Congratulations, bro.
[04:44.500 --> 04:46.180]  That sounds like a lot of fun.
[04:46.180 --> 04:49.880]  In my two by four with solo cups and I want to keep them small.
[04:49.880 --> 04:54.360]  So thanks for all of the great content every week and for the bomb genetics.
[04:54.360 --> 04:56.360]  Enjoy your week brother from Kip.
[04:56.360 --> 04:59.860]  I had some notes on here, but as I was reading this, I realized you're doing this in solo
[04:59.860 --> 05:04.280]  cups and I'm going to give one more detail before I read the notes that I actually have
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.880]  written to avoid taking clones from 36 solo cups.
[05:08.880 --> 05:10.160]  Have you thought about revegging?
[05:10.160 --> 05:12.360]  I know that is totally derailing your plan.
[05:12.360 --> 05:15.840]  You're asking me about cloning, which I will get to, but in my mind, if you're running
[05:15.840 --> 05:19.280]  solo cups, those plants are going to get, they're only going to get so big.
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.200]  You don't want them too large in a solo cup, especially in your limited space, large plant
[05:23.200 --> 05:24.200]  count there.
[05:24.200 --> 05:26.840]  I would just grow them very small.
[05:26.840 --> 05:28.200]  Then I would flower them.
[05:28.200 --> 05:31.000]  Then I would mark, uh, I would keep my favorites.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.280]  Then when I come to harvest, I would not harvest all of it.
[05:33.280 --> 05:37.960]  I'd leave the bottom buds from every one of them, then smoke it and then re-veg your favorites.
[05:37.960 --> 05:38.960]  That's what I would do.
[05:38.960 --> 05:43.000]  I would re-veg them instead of doing clones for plants this small, but I don't want to
[05:43.000 --> 05:44.080]  ruin your whole strategy.
[05:44.080 --> 05:46.040]  I don't want to rethink your whole program.
[05:46.040 --> 05:47.040]  That's just a suggestion.
[05:47.040 --> 05:48.640]  That is what would Rasta Jeff do.
[05:48.680 --> 05:49.680]  I would just re-veg.
[05:49.680 --> 05:52.600]  Now let's focus on the question because that's what you want to know.
[05:52.600 --> 05:53.600]  Let me be useful here.
[05:53.600 --> 05:56.240]  There are a couple of different ways to do this.
[05:56.240 --> 05:59.880]  In most situations, we would not be running such small plants.
[05:59.880 --> 06:02.140]  In most situations, we're going to have larger plants.
[06:02.140 --> 06:04.560]  Most people are not growing in solo cups.
[06:04.560 --> 06:07.400]  A very small percentage of us out there are growing in cups.
[06:07.400 --> 06:08.400]  I do it.
[06:08.400 --> 06:09.400]  That's how I run a lot of testers.
[06:09.400 --> 06:12.800]  Uh, some of the things that I just bred, I don't know what they're going to do.
[06:12.800 --> 06:15.800]  I want to see if it's intersex, if it smells good, looks good.
[06:15.800 --> 06:19.580]  So I'll run a bunch of those in cups just to get a feel for what I've got, but not everybody
[06:19.580 --> 06:20.580]  does that.
[06:20.580 --> 06:24.240]  In most scenarios, we're going to be growing larger plants in larger containers.
[06:24.240 --> 06:28.600]  So the first scenario I want to talk about is if we were to take clones from the bottom
[06:28.600 --> 06:31.120]  of the plant, a lot of times the plants will grow up.
[06:31.120 --> 06:32.120]  We leave the tops alone.
[06:32.120 --> 06:34.320]  We clean up the bottom right before we go into flower.
[06:34.320 --> 06:36.360]  That's called lollipopping or shaving the legs.
[06:36.360 --> 06:39.840]  Uh, you clean up the bottom branches and the take the suckers off the lower branches that
[06:39.840 --> 06:41.060]  you do leave.
[06:41.060 --> 06:45.240]  When you're doing that, I find that to be a great opportunity to take a couple of clones.
[06:45.240 --> 06:49.320]  The bottoms will have two, four, maybe six clones available right there on the bottom.
[06:49.320 --> 06:50.560]  You can cut off.
[06:50.560 --> 06:55.360]  If you are taking clones from the bottom, you can cut those off and you could in theory
[06:55.360 --> 06:59.400]  put your plant into flower right away because you don't need any hormones to move around.
[06:59.400 --> 07:02.440]  You don't need any recovery time because you're taking stuff from the bottom.
[07:02.440 --> 07:03.800]  You're just completely removing it.
[07:03.800 --> 07:06.240]  The hormones are already at the top where you want them.
[07:06.240 --> 07:09.200]  So if you're going to take stuff from the bottom, when you're lollipopping, you can
[07:09.200 --> 07:13.000]  do that basically anytime they don't need recovery time for that.
[07:13.000 --> 07:17.440]  Again, that one detail you should focus on is do you have roots on your clones or are
[07:17.440 --> 07:21.400]  you confident that your clones will root before you put your other plants into flower?
[07:21.400 --> 07:23.200]  I still kind of use that same practice.
[07:23.200 --> 07:26.920]  I don't flower the room until I see roots on the other clones that I've taken.
[07:26.920 --> 07:28.560]  So I know I've got backups.
[07:28.560 --> 07:30.640]  That's kind of a practice that I do employ.
[07:30.640 --> 07:31.800]  Let's talk about another option.
[07:31.800 --> 07:36.420]  Now, if you do choose to take clones from the top of the plants, then yes, I would wait
[07:36.420 --> 07:38.360]  for some recovery time.
[07:38.360 --> 07:42.580]  When I'm growing larger plants, I do generally top the plant once or twice.
[07:42.580 --> 07:45.060]  That main apical top makes a beautiful clone.
[07:45.060 --> 07:49.340]  A lot of times I will take the two bottoms and the main top right out of the plant and
[07:49.340 --> 07:53.000]  use those as my three clones in my cloner or in my clone machine.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.660]  So that's where my first three clones will come from.
[07:55.660 --> 08:00.660]  If I take that top clone, I do allow the plants at least 10 to 14 days to recover.
[08:00.660 --> 08:05.380]  You want the hormones in that plant to move around so that plant can establish who's got
[08:05.380 --> 08:07.020]  the new apical dominant top.
[08:07.020 --> 08:10.100]  That's part of why we top it is to confuse that plant's hormones.
[08:10.100 --> 08:11.980]  And it goes, wait, we had one dominant top.
[08:11.980 --> 08:15.580]  That's the plant's goal is to have one dominant top to get up there and get pollinated.
[08:15.580 --> 08:19.060]  And the rest of the branches are just kind of extra branches to get pollen and keep life
[08:19.060 --> 08:20.060]  going.
[08:20.060 --> 08:22.980]  But when you take out that main top, all the others go, hey, I've got the chance to be
[08:22.980 --> 08:23.980]  the top.
[08:23.980 --> 08:24.980]  So we got to let that action happen.
[08:24.980 --> 08:28.700]  And they'll all even out and all try to grow up and be tops and you get a bunch more main
[08:28.700 --> 08:29.980]  tops on the plant.
[08:29.980 --> 08:34.460]  We do need to allow some time for those hormones to move around and for things to recover after
[08:34.460 --> 08:36.400]  we do take the main top out.
[08:36.400 --> 08:40.900]  You could hypothetically go directly into flower, but you will get a much smaller yield.
[08:40.900 --> 08:43.420]  Your top buds won't be as large as they could be.
[08:43.420 --> 08:46.940]  And that's always where most of the weight and the yield and the bulk comes from is that
[08:46.940 --> 08:48.180]  top part of the plant there.
[08:48.180 --> 08:52.580]  So you would be handicapping yourself, kneecapping, crippling yourself if you were to do that
[08:52.580 --> 08:53.840]  too quickly.
[08:53.840 --> 08:57.260]  Another thing to think about there is if you were trellising, if you're topping, or if
[08:57.260 --> 09:00.660]  you're scrugging, excuse me, if you're working them into a net, you may want to allow some
[09:00.660 --> 09:04.840]  time to work them in the net, let them recover a little bit before you do put them into flower.
[09:04.840 --> 09:07.940]  That will help them grow, like I said, bigger, fatter buds.
[09:07.940 --> 09:10.740]  And that is the main goal is those big fat juicy nuggets.
[09:11.580 --> 09:15.020]  So if you are taking the quick answer, if you're taking clones from the bottom, go ahead
[09:15.020 --> 09:16.020]  and flip it.
[09:16.020 --> 09:19.780]  If you're cutting the tops, do allow some time for recovery.
[09:19.780 --> 09:22.300]  My friend Kip, thank you for the great question, bro.
[09:22.300 --> 09:23.500]  I do appreciate it.
[09:23.500 --> 09:25.700]  I look forward to hearing back from you.
[09:25.700 --> 09:30.940]  And I do look forward to seeing how your 36-plant phenol hunt goes in your small space.
[09:30.940 --> 09:34.460]  If you need any help, have any questions, need some guidance, please do reach out for
[09:34.460 --> 09:38.580]  that because I've done basically this exact thing that you were going to do.
[09:38.580 --> 09:41.060]  And I do wish you the best of luck.
[09:41.060 --> 09:42.980]  All right, I'm going to keep the show moving.
[09:42.980 --> 09:46.100]  I do have one more great question right here in front of me.
[09:46.100 --> 09:48.260]  This one comes from our friend Sean.
[09:48.260 --> 09:50.900]  It doesn't have a lot of info about the name they want me to use, so we're going to call
[09:50.900 --> 09:52.540]  you Sean today.
[09:52.540 --> 09:53.780]  This one was quick and to the point.
[09:53.780 --> 09:57.980]  It said, do a video collecting pollen, another pollinating a female.
[09:57.980 --> 10:00.500]  Then it says you've done the STS and clone cutting.
[10:00.500 --> 10:02.180]  Just a thought, but I know you're busy, man.
[10:02.180 --> 10:04.620]  I love these quick to the point emails.
[10:04.620 --> 10:06.540]  These are awesome.
[10:06.540 --> 10:07.540]  Let's talk about this.
[10:07.700 --> 10:10.140]  Sean said, do a video collecting pollen.
[10:10.140 --> 10:11.660]  That is a great idea.
[10:11.660 --> 10:18.900]  However, YouTube does not like it when I post videos that do contain live plants.
[10:18.900 --> 10:23.300]  YouTube has removed a couple of my videos because they've got live plants in them.
[10:23.300 --> 10:29.100]  YouTube has also been taking down videos and channels that are part of our community, so
[10:29.100 --> 10:30.380]  I'm trying to be extra careful.
[10:30.380 --> 10:33.900]  You may have noticed sometimes I'm more careful with some of the words that I do use.
[10:33.900 --> 10:36.660]  I'm definitely going to be more careful with some of the content.
[10:36.780 --> 10:38.660]  I would like to keep the channel alive.
[10:38.660 --> 10:39.900]  We do a lot of education.
[10:39.900 --> 10:41.100]  We've got a great community here.
[10:41.100 --> 10:42.900]  The comment section is always beautiful.
[10:42.900 --> 10:44.460]  You guys keep going in the comments.
[10:44.460 --> 10:48.180]  I love that, but I have to be very careful with what I'm putting out on YouTube.
[10:48.180 --> 10:53.340]  I cannot do a pollen collection video, but I can describe it with words.
[10:53.340 --> 10:54.740]  That should be safe.
[10:54.740 --> 10:56.940]  Let me talk a little bit about collecting pollen.
[10:56.940 --> 10:58.580]  I've got too many notes on the table here.
[10:58.580 --> 11:01.420]  Let me cover up this other page so I'm not so distracted.
[11:01.420 --> 11:04.300]  Yes, I do have the ADD.
[11:04.300 --> 11:06.860]  Big shout out to the friend who made the Lemon Jeffrey Concentrate.
[11:06.860 --> 11:07.860]  It is working, bro.
[11:07.860 --> 11:09.500]  Anyway, let's get back on track.
[11:09.500 --> 11:11.540]  Let's talk about collecting pollen.
[11:11.540 --> 11:14.180]  I can't show you the plants because of YouTube rules.
[11:14.180 --> 11:16.260]  That's my first note here.
[11:16.260 --> 11:20.660]  The first thing I want to talk about when it comes to collecting pollen is know your
[11:20.660 --> 11:21.660]  mail.
[11:21.660 --> 11:22.660]  What are you working with?
[11:22.660 --> 11:23.660]  Do you know that that's a good mail?
[11:23.660 --> 11:24.660]  Where'd you get that?
[11:24.660 --> 11:25.660]  Make a good decision there.
[11:25.660 --> 11:30.860]  Then, the next thing I'm going to talk about is no wind and no disruptions and no sprays.
[11:30.860 --> 11:32.180]  We don't want a lot of wind in the room.
[11:32.340 --> 11:37.220]  You're going to put your plant into flower and around day 14 or day 17, maybe 21-ish,
[11:37.220 --> 11:39.100]  you're going to start getting a lot of pollen.
[11:39.100 --> 11:40.460]  We don't need any wind in the room.
[11:40.460 --> 11:42.660]  That's going to blow that pollen right off of your plant.
[11:42.660 --> 11:44.060]  You're not going to be able to collect it.
[11:44.060 --> 11:47.660]  We don't want to spray anything in the room because that, of course, is going to destroy
[11:47.660 --> 11:48.660]  the pollen.
[11:48.660 --> 11:49.660]  We don't want that.
[11:49.660 --> 11:51.300]  Basically, no disruptions to this plant.
[11:51.300 --> 11:53.900]  Try not to nudge it, bump it, don't move it around.
[11:53.900 --> 11:57.340]  Keep that mail plant in the same place so that it can basically build up a whole bunch
[11:57.340 --> 12:00.060]  of pollen for you to collect.
[12:00.060 --> 12:02.460]  There are several ways to collect the pollen.
[12:02.460 --> 12:04.020]  Let's jump into that part.
[12:04.020 --> 12:08.380]  The first method that I'm going to talk about is while the plant is still alive and standing.
[12:08.380 --> 12:12.940]  Then, eventually, we will cut this plant down and talk about other ways to gather the pollen
[12:12.940 --> 12:13.940]  there.
[12:13.940 --> 12:15.340]  The first way, this plant is standing.
[12:15.340 --> 12:16.620]  You've got your growing plant.
[12:16.620 --> 12:19.060]  It is growing just like a normal plant except this one's a boy.
[12:19.060 --> 12:21.100]  It's got balls all over it.
[12:21.100 --> 12:26.060]  One thing you can do to collect the pollen is to put a collection vessel underneath the
[12:26.060 --> 12:27.060]  plant.
[12:27.060 --> 12:28.220]  I've seen people use a big mirror.
[12:28.220 --> 12:30.140]  I've seen people use dinner plates.
[12:30.140 --> 12:34.220]  I've seen people use just a sheet of glass, something like that underneath the plant that
[12:34.220 --> 12:37.500]  will collect the pollen that you can scrape it up and scoop it up very easily.
[12:37.500 --> 12:39.180]  It's a really good idea.
[12:39.180 --> 12:42.940]  Make sure that whatever you use is non-static.
[12:42.940 --> 12:47.580]  I've seen people use a little plate that was plastic or a styrofoam plate.
[12:47.580 --> 12:51.940]  The pollen actually fell out of the plant and static electricity pushed that pollen
[12:51.940 --> 12:52.940]  right away.
[12:52.940 --> 12:56.980]  We did not collect any pollen at all because there was static on the plastic or styrofoam
[12:56.980 --> 12:58.060]  plate.
[12:58.900 --> 13:02.940]  I recommend glass, maybe a Pyrex dish, maybe a glass dinner plate.
[13:02.940 --> 13:05.180]  If you've got a big mirror, that is perfect.
[13:05.180 --> 13:07.300]  Imagine that you just put the mirror down.
[13:07.300 --> 13:08.820]  This is just an idea.
[13:08.820 --> 13:11.980]  You put the mirror down under the plant and then you set the plant, the whole pot right
[13:11.980 --> 13:12.980]  on top of that mirror.
[13:12.980 --> 13:16.740]  Then all of the pollen that falls down will land right on that mirror or that sheet of
[13:16.740 --> 13:19.060]  glass or whatever you have chosen.
[13:19.060 --> 13:21.900]  That does sound sketchy because you're putting a plant right onto the mirror.
[13:21.900 --> 13:24.060]  If you've got a small plant, it's not a big deal.
[13:24.060 --> 13:26.660]  If you've got a thick mirror, it's not a big deal.
[13:26.660 --> 13:30.060]  You've got to run some risks if you want to win the game sometimes.
[13:30.060 --> 13:34.260]  Another thing we could talk about is you just let that pollen fall right onto that mirror.
[13:34.260 --> 13:35.260]  It will start pollinating.
[13:35.260 --> 13:36.860]  It will fall right down on there.
[13:36.860 --> 13:40.020]  Another thing we can do is sometimes I'll take a plant and instead of letting it grow
[13:40.020 --> 13:43.740]  straight up, I'll just grab it right in the middle and I'll put a tie on it and I'll bend
[13:43.740 --> 13:47.220]  that plant down, maybe like a 45, maybe a 90-degree angle.
[13:47.220 --> 13:48.500]  I'm not sure where my arm is right now.
[13:48.500 --> 13:49.740]  I'm not good with angles, I guess.
[13:49.740 --> 13:50.740]  That's a 45.
[13:50.740 --> 13:54.780]  We'll put it at a 45-degree angle and then we'll put the collection vessel underneath
[13:54.780 --> 13:55.780]  that.
[13:55.900 --> 13:58.820]  If you've got it kind of tipped, it's going to fall more directly onto the vessel.
[13:58.820 --> 14:01.100]  You don't have the 360 falling of pollen.
[14:01.100 --> 14:06.500]  You got one more long distance of pollen falling, maybe like a glass baking sheet, a Pyrex sheet
[14:06.500 --> 14:09.820]  or something like that would be perfect to collect the pollen underneath there.
[14:09.820 --> 14:13.180]  You can just let it grow and that pollen will start falling out.
[14:13.180 --> 14:15.960]  That's a really easy way to do it.
[14:15.960 --> 14:19.820]  Another way that you could do it is to start tapping the plant.
[14:19.820 --> 14:23.420]  If you've got it growing straight up or if you've got it tipped over, I go in there.
[14:23.420 --> 14:24.420]  I honestly, I'm a drummer.
[14:24.420 --> 14:25.700]  I've got drumsticks laying around.
[14:25.740 --> 14:29.660]  I go in with the drumstick and a collection vessel, usually a Pyrex dish, sometimes a
[14:29.660 --> 14:34.380]  jar and I'll just hold that dish or that Pyrex dish or the jar right up to the plant and
[14:34.380 --> 14:37.300]  I'll just start tapping the plant and the pollen falls right out into my dish.
[14:37.300 --> 14:39.540]  I just use the drumstick, tap, tap, tap.
[14:39.540 --> 14:43.460]  When you do this, pollen is going to go everywhere.
[14:43.460 --> 14:46.900]  I recommend maybe wearing a mask, maybe covering up.
[14:46.900 --> 14:51.220]  If you've got other plants around that you don't want to pollinate, definitely take precautions
[14:51.220 --> 14:52.220]  for that.
[14:52.220 --> 14:55.340]  If you're going to wet those plants while you're messing with the pollen, then clean
[14:55.340 --> 14:56.340]  yourself up.
[14:56.340 --> 14:58.260]  Make sure that, so water deactivates pollen.
[14:58.260 --> 15:01.660]  You guys, if you've got pollen on you in your dreadlocks, in your clothes, in your beard,
[15:01.660 --> 15:06.140]  on your clothes, wherever else, I haven't said on your shoes is where I think I'm headed.
[15:06.140 --> 15:07.140]  Water will deactivate that.
[15:07.140 --> 15:10.460]  So you can get a pump spray or a water bottle, spray yourself down real good or hop in the
[15:10.460 --> 15:13.280]  shower that will get rid of all that active pollen.
[15:13.280 --> 15:15.940]  Also if you spray down the plants, the pistils are wet.
[15:15.940 --> 15:18.360]  They are less likely to receive the pollen at that time.
[15:18.360 --> 15:23.240]  That should help you out a little bit, but be, be very careful because that pollen is
[15:23.240 --> 15:27.920]  very tiny and one flake of pollen equals one seed and you can get a bunch of pollen just
[15:27.920 --> 15:31.300]  stuck in your dreadlocks and your arm hair and your clothes on your shoes.
[15:31.300 --> 15:32.300]  It does not take much.
[15:32.300 --> 15:34.720]  So be very careful with the pollen.
[15:34.720 --> 15:38.640]  So as soon as you start tapping that plant, pollen is going to start coming out and going
[15:38.640 --> 15:39.640]  flying.
[15:39.640 --> 15:41.120]  A lot of it will fall straight down.
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.360]  Tap gently just enough, maybe tap lower on the branch, tap down here and the pollen up
[15:45.360 --> 15:47.140]  here will start falling out.
[15:47.140 --> 15:48.740]  Don't be too aggressive.
[15:48.740 --> 15:50.860]  Also don't have any fans on.
[15:50.860 --> 15:56.180]  Don't breathe too heavily and definitely do not sneeze because you will blow your pollen
[15:56.180 --> 15:57.260]  all over the place.
[15:57.260 --> 15:58.900]  All of your work will be a waste of time.
[15:58.900 --> 16:01.120]  That pollen will go everywhere.
[16:01.120 --> 16:06.500]  As long as this plant is alive, it will continue to produce pollen up till probably week 10,
[16:06.500 --> 16:07.580]  week 11.
[16:07.580 --> 16:10.900]  Whenever it starts burning out, it'll start, it'll go into senescence and give up, but
[16:10.900 --> 16:12.760]  you'll get plenty of pollen out of it.
[16:12.760 --> 16:16.760]  You can keep that plant pollinating and just keep tapping it every few days and more pollen
[16:16.760 --> 16:20.800]  will come out or leave your collection vessel underneath it and more pollen will land onto
[16:20.800 --> 16:22.680]  that glass plate or that Pyrex dish.
[16:22.680 --> 16:25.640]  If you've got it bent over, more pollen will fall out.
[16:25.640 --> 16:30.440]  I've seen guys just run a ganja plant, a male ganja plant in the extra bathroom or in the
[16:30.440 --> 16:32.940]  window just in the sunlight in the flowering season.
[16:32.940 --> 16:37.080]  Right now, outdoor season, the plant would go into flower within 21 days.
[16:37.080 --> 16:40.620]  Excuse me, within 21-ish days, it would start banging out pollen.
[16:40.620 --> 16:44.160]  We could collect pollen really easily just by putting a plant in this window right here
[16:44.160 --> 16:45.160]  and give it some time.
[16:45.160 --> 16:48.440]  If we gave it a dark period, if we turned off all the lights in the house and just used
[16:48.440 --> 16:51.920]  the sunlight, the natural sunlight, so if you put a plant in the bathroom, close the
[16:51.920 --> 16:55.920]  door, open the window, let the sun function on that, it would make pollen for you.
[16:55.920 --> 16:58.080]  If it were a male, it would begin to make pollen for you.
[16:58.080 --> 16:59.960]  You could collect pollen that easily.
[16:59.960 --> 17:03.320]  Now we can continue to collect pollen until we've got as much as we need.
[17:03.320 --> 17:05.000]  We do not need a lot.
[17:05.000 --> 17:08.560]  Once you feel like this plant is done, now it is time to cut the plant down.
[17:08.560 --> 17:13.520]  I would gently, carefully, if you can, try to remove the largest leaves from the plant.
[17:13.520 --> 17:16.080]  Not a big deal if you can't do it without disturbing the plant.
[17:16.080 --> 17:17.760]  I'm kind of a defoliation ninja.
[17:17.760 --> 17:20.880]  I could just grab with the thumb and the forefinger and just take off the leaf real easily.
[17:20.880 --> 17:22.680]  It just pops right off for me.
[17:22.680 --> 17:24.920]  If you don't have those ninja skills, maybe don't do it.
[17:24.920 --> 17:28.080]  But now is a good time to take off some of the bigger leaves.
[17:28.080 --> 17:29.840]  Then I usually get a Pyrex dish.
[17:29.840 --> 17:32.840]  I've got a Pyrex dish that my...I don't even know where it came from.
[17:32.840 --> 17:36.400]  It probably used to be made to make...used to make brownies or some sort of casserole.
[17:36.400 --> 17:37.520]  I have commandeered it.
[17:37.520 --> 17:40.960]  That is now my pollen collection vessel.
[17:40.960 --> 17:44.640]  It's about probably 16 inches long and 8 or 9 inches wide.
[17:44.640 --> 17:46.520]  A beautiful pan to go in the oven.
[17:46.520 --> 17:47.520]  No longer that.
[17:47.520 --> 17:48.520]  Now it is my pollen dish.
[17:48.520 --> 17:51.920]  I usually take the top off the plant or if it's a small plant, maybe I'll take the whole
[17:51.920 --> 17:57.120]  plant, chop it, and gently lay that male plant into that Pyrex dish and I will let it dry
[17:57.120 --> 17:58.400]  right there.
[17:58.400 --> 18:01.080]  As it dries, more pollen will fall out of it.
[18:01.080 --> 18:02.080]  So it'll just fall.
[18:02.080 --> 18:03.960]  All the pollen comes out into that Pyrex dish.
[18:03.960 --> 18:07.520]  Once I feel like it's super dry, I'll kind of crunch the tops with my fingers.
[18:07.520 --> 18:09.360]  All the last bits of pollen will fall out.
[18:09.480 --> 18:11.880]  I'll lift that male plant and I just give it one of these.
[18:11.880 --> 18:15.960]  I kind of grab it at the base and use my fingers just to kind of pull all the pollen right
[18:15.960 --> 18:18.880]  off of there into the dish to make sure to get the last of it.
[18:18.880 --> 18:20.440]  Then I'll discard that male plant.
[18:20.440 --> 18:21.440]  He's done his job.
[18:21.440 --> 18:23.220]  I've got a dish with pollen in it.
[18:23.220 --> 18:24.400]  Now I let that dry.
[18:24.400 --> 18:26.080]  I want the pollen dry.
[18:26.080 --> 18:28.000]  I'm gonna say it again, bone, bone dry.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.160]  I said earlier, water will destroy your pollen.
[18:31.160 --> 18:34.080]  So at this point, we want to get that bone dry.
[18:34.080 --> 18:35.080]  I would get tweezers.
[18:35.080 --> 18:39.000]  I would get some sort of sifting device and pull out all of the debris, all of the male
[18:39.000 --> 18:41.960]  flowers, anything that is not pollen needs to come out of here.
[18:41.960 --> 18:44.040]  Let it dry really dry.
[18:44.040 --> 18:47.000]  Then put it in a container, an airtight dry container.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.240]  I prefer a glass container, maybe a glass vial with a silicate pack.
[18:51.240 --> 18:55.120]  I'm going to say it again, a silicate pack, not a Boveda pack.
[18:55.120 --> 18:59.560]  We want the package that sucks up the moisture, not maintains a humidity level.
[18:59.560 --> 19:02.240]  We want zero humidity in this package.
[19:02.240 --> 19:04.800]  So put a silicate pack in there.
[19:04.800 --> 19:07.200]  Some people use rice to absorb the moisture.
[19:07.200 --> 19:08.200]  That may work for you.
[19:08.200 --> 19:10.200]  I don't know how much rice per pollen.
[19:10.200 --> 19:11.880]  Honestly, I don't do that.
[19:11.880 --> 19:13.720]  I use the silicate pack.
[19:13.720 --> 19:18.120]  So put that in there to absorb the moisture and get your package super dry before you
[19:18.120 --> 19:19.120]  seal it up.
[19:19.120 --> 19:22.800]  Then when you seal it up, I do recommend you put that in a cool, dry, dark place.
[19:22.800 --> 19:27.160]  I keep my pollen in the crisper drawer in the refrigerator, and it seems to work for
[19:27.160 --> 19:30.680]  about two, maybe three or four, sometimes up to six months.
[19:30.680 --> 19:31.680]  It depends on the pollen.
[19:31.680 --> 19:33.600]  It kind of depends on, I don't know.
[19:33.600 --> 19:36.640]  I've had a lot of variables, so I don't know what it really depends on.
[19:36.640 --> 19:37.920]  Some of it stores real well.
[19:37.920 --> 19:39.440]  Some of it just doesn't.
[19:39.440 --> 19:43.000]  Now the way that I usually do this is I don't generally collect a lot of pollen.
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.720]  The way that I usually do it is I will run the male plant.
[19:45.720 --> 19:46.800]  I'll run the female plant.
[19:46.800 --> 19:48.440]  I'll time them perfectly.
[19:48.440 --> 19:52.200]  When it is time for pollination, I drag that boy plant right to the middle of the room,
[19:52.200 --> 19:53.720]  and I give them a good shake.
[19:53.720 --> 19:56.720]  And all that pollen will come out, and I'll watch that pollen go everywhere.
[19:56.720 --> 19:57.920]  There are no fans on.
[19:57.920 --> 20:00.120]  I usually do it in the dark.
[20:00.120 --> 20:01.120]  I try not to breathe.
[20:01.120 --> 20:02.720]  I try not to sneeze.
[20:02.840 --> 20:04.440]  I let the pollination happen.
[20:04.440 --> 20:06.360]  Then I'll wait four or five days.
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.880]  Let that pollen build up again.
[20:07.880 --> 20:10.600]  I'll go back in there, give them another shake.
[20:10.600 --> 20:14.840]  Then when I'm done shaking him, I'll cut him down and actually go and smack that male plant
[20:14.840 --> 20:17.320]  either against the fan or against the light.
[20:17.320 --> 20:21.200]  I've got lights with a shield right at the glass, the glass reflector right above it.
[20:21.200 --> 20:23.600]  I'll hit that light, and the pollen just comes raining down.
[20:23.600 --> 20:25.320]  Yeah, it makes a little extra cleanup.
[20:25.320 --> 20:26.320]  There's pollen everywhere.
[20:26.320 --> 20:27.560]  I got to clean up anyway.
[20:27.560 --> 20:29.240]  So I smack that dead plant.
[20:29.240 --> 20:30.240]  I just cut it down.
[20:30.240 --> 20:32.220]  I smack that plant right up against the light.
[20:32.220 --> 20:34.020]  All the pollen comes raining down.
[20:34.020 --> 20:36.900]  Then I will discard that male plant because I don't need it anymore.
[20:36.900 --> 20:38.180]  But I don't even keep the male around.
[20:38.180 --> 20:39.420]  I don't collect the pollen.
[20:39.420 --> 20:42.220]  I just cut him down, smack him around, get the pollen everywhere.
[20:42.220 --> 20:44.660]  He's done his job, and now he's free to go.
[20:44.660 --> 20:47.340]  Now you've got pollen in your collection vessel.
[20:47.340 --> 20:48.660]  You've probably stored it.
[20:48.660 --> 20:50.020]  You've had it in the fridge for a little while.
[20:50.020 --> 20:52.980]  Now your female plants are ready for pollination.
[20:52.980 --> 20:54.140]  Let's talk about how to do that.
[20:54.140 --> 20:55.980]  There are several ways you could do it.
[20:55.980 --> 21:00.020]  If you've got a lot of pollen, you could just go in there and maybe turn off all the fans
[21:00.140 --> 21:04.940]  and just go right above the canopy and just open up your pollen, whatever it's in, and
[21:04.940 --> 21:08.020]  just give it a few taps and just let some pollen just gently fall out.
[21:08.020 --> 21:10.580]  You'll see it just gently sprinkle the plants.
[21:10.580 --> 21:14.380]  Or if you want to carefully pollinate one or two branches, you could get a Q-tip or
[21:14.380 --> 21:17.760]  a paintbrush and you can pull the branch down that you want.
[21:17.760 --> 21:21.800]  Maybe even pull that plant out of the room and do this in a more isolated space.
[21:21.800 --> 21:25.460]  Take that female plant, take that pollen, and just paint the branches that you want
[21:25.460 --> 21:26.460]  with the pollen.
[21:26.460 --> 21:30.380]  You can get a Q-tip or the paintbrush right into the pollen and then carefully apply that
[21:30.380 --> 21:34.340]  pollen to the pistils of the plant you want to pollinate.
[21:34.340 --> 21:35.340]  Then mark that branch.
[21:35.340 --> 21:37.460]  If you only do a couple of branches, mark it.
[21:37.460 --> 21:38.460]  Keep an eye on that branch.
[21:38.460 --> 21:41.460]  Then when those seeds are ready, you know that they're right there in that one, those
[21:41.460 --> 21:43.540]  two branches that you pollinated.
[21:43.540 --> 21:47.740]  Be very careful because I've talked about how easy it is to accidentally pollinate things.
[21:47.740 --> 21:52.540]  If you sneeze, if you breathe too heavily, if you bump that jar, if you bump the baggie,
[21:52.540 --> 21:53.660]  pollen will go flying around.
[21:53.660 --> 21:55.700]  You may accidentally pollinate things.
[21:55.780 --> 22:00.180]  If you are careful, you should be able to use a Q-tip, a paintbrush, something of that
[22:00.180 --> 22:03.860]  nature and get in there and scoop a little bit of pollen out of that container and just
[22:03.860 --> 22:05.940]  apply it perfectly to the plants.
[22:05.940 --> 22:08.300]  Or you could take it and you could just sprinkle it right above the plants.
[22:08.300 --> 22:11.540]  I've seen guys pour it onto a piece of paper and just blow on it.
[22:11.540 --> 22:14.140]  When you blow on it, that shit goes everywhere.
[22:14.140 --> 22:15.540]  It's going to move more than you expect.
[22:15.540 --> 22:19.300]  It takes one or two test runs maybe to figure out how hard to blow to get the pollen to
[22:19.300 --> 22:20.300]  move.
[22:20.300 --> 22:23.820]  But dump it onto a little piece of paper and just give it a ... and just let it blow.
[22:23.820 --> 22:26.940]  The reason you don't go straight onto your hand, you guys, is because your sweat will
[22:26.940 --> 22:27.940]  destroy the pollen.
[22:27.940 --> 22:32.300]  That moisture has the opportunity, the potential to destroy your pollen.
[22:32.300 --> 22:35.900]  So let me make sure that I've answered most of the question here.
[22:35.900 --> 22:36.900]  Collect the pollen.
[22:36.900 --> 22:37.900]  Tap it.
[22:37.900 --> 22:38.900]  Just bend the plant over and tap it.
[22:38.900 --> 22:41.420]  Collect that shit or let the plant get finished up.
[22:41.420 --> 22:44.620]  Cut it down when you've got enough pollen and then start fucking smacking that plant
[22:44.620 --> 22:47.100]  on flowers or put it in a container.
[22:47.100 --> 22:48.500]  Collect the pollen that way.
[22:48.500 --> 22:50.220]  Get the pollen super dry.
[22:50.220 --> 22:52.780]  That is one of the most important parts here.
[22:52.780 --> 22:53.820]  Use a silicate pack.
[22:53.820 --> 22:56.100]  Do not use a Boveda pack.
[22:56.100 --> 22:57.340]  Dry the pollen.
[22:57.340 --> 23:02.700]  Then use a paintbrush or a Q-tip to apply the pollen to the branches that you want to
[23:02.700 --> 23:03.700]  pollinate.
[23:03.700 --> 23:07.500]  When you have successful pollination, you will see the pistils kind of curl in.
[23:07.500 --> 23:10.540]  The pistils look like the dandelions, the hairs, you guys call them.
[23:10.540 --> 23:11.540]  That part is sticking out.
[23:11.540 --> 23:15.440]  When you put pollen on there, that part will curl up and turn brown and get withered.
[23:15.440 --> 23:17.740]  That is a sign of successful pollination.
[23:17.740 --> 23:19.580]  Pay attention to the parts you've pollinated.
[23:19.580 --> 23:22.020]  Over the next few weeks, watch the development.
[23:22.020 --> 23:24.940]  Around four, five, six weeks in, some plants go faster than others.
[23:24.940 --> 23:28.180]  You guys, I can't tell you exactly how long it will take.
[23:28.180 --> 23:31.620]  Four or five, six weeks in, you'll start seeing the seeds getting harder.
[23:31.620 --> 23:35.060]  Around five or six weeks, start pulling one or two out randomly and just squeezing them
[23:35.060 --> 23:36.700]  and see how hard they are.
[23:36.700 --> 23:39.820]  Around week seven or week eight, they'll definitely be ready by then.
[23:39.820 --> 23:41.580]  You'll have a nice batch of seeds.
[23:41.580 --> 23:43.940]  The way I harvest seeds, we'll just quickly do this since we're here.
[23:43.940 --> 23:46.540]  I've done a full show on it, but we'll go quickly.
[23:46.540 --> 23:50.740]  When I harvest for seed, right before harvest time, I do a heavy defoliation.
[23:50.740 --> 23:53.060]  You don't need all those leaves in there.
[23:53.060 --> 23:59.180]  Also, I turn my lights back to 18-6 shortly after pollination to speed up the time to
[23:59.180 --> 24:01.460]  get the seeds ripe, but I'm getting ahead of myself.
[24:01.460 --> 24:02.460]  I chop.
[24:02.460 --> 24:03.460]  I heavily defoliate.
[24:03.460 --> 24:04.460]  I chop down the plants.
[24:04.460 --> 24:05.460]  I hang them upside down.
[24:05.460 --> 24:07.220]  I let them get completely dry.
[24:07.220 --> 24:09.620]  Before I even mess with these plants, they are bone dry.
[24:09.620 --> 24:12.740]  If you're trying to grow weed and smoke this weed, it's going to be dust.
[24:12.740 --> 24:13.740]  This is useless.
[24:13.740 --> 24:15.620]  I let it get bone, bone dry.
[24:15.620 --> 24:18.980]  Then I take that plant and I put it into a big Sterlite container.
[24:18.980 --> 24:22.300]  I use a glove and I just pull all of the buds off the sticks.
[24:22.300 --> 24:25.580]  I just yank the sticks right out of it so the buds land in this container.
[24:25.580 --> 24:28.020]  It sounds like seeds and rocks hitting the container.
[24:28.020 --> 24:32.100]  Then I put on rubber gloves again and I grind all that bud up with my hands until I've got
[24:32.100 --> 24:33.100]  just a pile.
[24:33.100 --> 24:34.460]  It looks like we're going to roll a bunch of joints.
[24:34.460 --> 24:37.340]  There's a bunch of seeds in it and a bunch of joint material.
[24:37.340 --> 24:40.180]  Then I will run that through a seed sorting machine.
[24:40.180 --> 24:42.500]  I do have a seed sorting machine that makes it very easy.
[24:42.500 --> 24:45.340]  If you've got a lot of seeds, I would recommend investing in that.
[24:45.340 --> 24:46.660]  It will save you a lot of time.
[24:46.660 --> 24:49.620]  If not, there are a lot of ways to go about sorting the seeds.
[24:49.620 --> 24:50.620]  That is how I harvest.
[24:50.620 --> 24:55.220]  I defoliate, cut them down, let them hang, get them dry as fuck.
[24:55.220 --> 24:58.980]  Once they're dry as fuck, I just do this and crumble them up until I've got joint rolling
[24:58.980 --> 24:59.980]  material.
[24:59.980 --> 25:03.300]  Pull out all the sticks, pull out all the junk, then pull out all the seeds.
[25:03.300 --> 25:07.260]  Honestly, the rest of that material has been so beat up that it goes into the compost bin
[25:07.260 --> 25:08.500]  or the Bokashi bucket.
[25:08.500 --> 25:09.980]  I do not even use it.
[25:09.980 --> 25:12.740]  That may offend a lot of people, but it is garbage at this point.
[25:12.740 --> 25:16.740]  There's so much chlorophyll and just junk and dust in it that you don't even want it.
[25:16.740 --> 25:23.380]  All right, I think I've covered the best part of my pollination and collecting pollen recipe,
[25:23.380 --> 25:25.020]  my secret here, my guide.
[25:25.020 --> 25:27.740]  If you've got any more questions, please do send me an email.
