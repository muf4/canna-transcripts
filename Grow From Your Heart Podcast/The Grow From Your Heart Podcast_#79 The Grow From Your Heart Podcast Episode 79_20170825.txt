[00:11.960 --> 00:23.270]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community. It's time for episode number 79 of the Grow From
[00:23.270 --> 00:27.230]  Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's
[00:27.230 --> 00:31.130]  right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:31.130 --> 00:34.930]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.930 --> 00:39.430]  about the current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your
[00:39.430 --> 00:43.190]  host Rasta Jeff. Thanks again for joining me. As always, I want to send that huge thank
[00:43.190 --> 00:46.630]  you shout out to the mystic roots band. They let me use their song on the show. It's really
[00:46.630 --> 00:51.670]  cool. Then big thanks to Kat Coop and the entire mystic roots crew. I hope you guys
[00:51.670 --> 00:54.430]  are having a great evening. Sorry. I got to clear my throat right at the start of the
[00:54.430 --> 00:58.030]  show. I'm already getting a frog in my throat. Dude sitting across the table from me. You
[00:58.030 --> 01:01.750]  guys will have no, you'll be so surprised. Guess who's here. Jesse's back. Say what's
[01:01.750 --> 01:05.670]  up bro. Hey, what's up everyone. You have no idea how hard it is to get this guy on
[01:05.670 --> 01:09.470]  a podcast. You guys, you have no idea what it takes to pull Jesse away from his life
[01:09.470 --> 01:12.870]  to come be on the show for an hour and get him high out of his mind and then send him
[01:12.870 --> 01:17.150]  home hungry as shit. All right, dude. Thanks for coming, bro. Really appreciate it. Oh,
[01:17.150 --> 01:21.990]  no problem. Jesse is a busy man. He's a ganja farmer. He's a running some shit over at hydro
[01:21.990 --> 01:27.710]  indoor growing supplies. What else you got going on, bro? A mechanic shop, mechanic shop,
[01:27.710 --> 01:33.110]  hot rod shop. This guy does a little bit of everything. You need to learn how to do. Are
[01:33.110 --> 01:39.830]  you an electrician? Okay. No. If you ask somebody if they're an electrician and they go, well,
[01:39.830 --> 01:44.270]  no, they are not an electrician. Yeah. It doesn't need to be legal is the big question
[01:44.270 --> 01:50.750]  there. So that means no. So this is something that Jesse is good at. He is the man at hydro
[01:50.750 --> 01:54.430]  indoor growing supplies. Uh, this podcast is brought to you by my great friends at hydro
[01:54.430 --> 01:59.190]  indoor growing supplies. Hydro indoor growing supplies has two locations to serve Colorado.

[02:50.470 --> 02:54.590]  hotmail.com. I'll get you all the information you need. Uh, are we start the show with a
[02:54.590 --> 02:59.190]  freaking frog in my throat? That's awesome. Uh, so Jesse is here. You guys, we don't have
[02:59.190 --> 03:04.510]  to do a whole bunch of technical formal introductions. Let's get right down to it. Uh, we all wanted
[03:04.510 --> 03:09.270]  Jesse to come on the show and do another grow lesson for us because it's outdoor season.
[03:09.270 --> 03:15.070]  Uh, we know that growing outdoor is almost free. Uh, some people asked me kind of about
[03:15.070 --> 03:20.550]  doing a budget episode, like if they don't have a lot of money. So I figured we'll work
[03:20.550 --> 03:25.390]  on getting the basics of an outdoor grow going. And then maybe if we have some extra time,
[03:25.390 --> 03:28.990]  we will talk about maybe how to do a budget grow. So that way people don't have to break
[03:28.990 --> 03:33.550]  the bank to build their grow and grow a whole bunch of ganja. Oh yeah. Keep it as, Oh yeah.
[03:33.590 --> 03:36.990]  Oh yeah. We have some ideas. Jesse and I have been at this for a minute. I bet we could
[03:36.990 --> 03:42.030]  build a hoop house together and probably two hours. Oh, easily. Yeah. Yeah. Jesse's got
[03:42.030 --> 03:49.070]  the tools and I'll keep the dad nail hot. So, uh, we're going to, a lot of what we're
[03:49.070 --> 03:52.950]  going to talk about may be kind of regional to Colorado. You may have to adjust a lot
[03:52.950 --> 03:57.830]  of what we say for your area. Um, if you're in California, you may be a little bit earlier
[03:57.830 --> 04:02.350]  than us. If you're on the East coast, it's going to be a whole different story. Yeah.
[04:02.350 --> 04:05.470]  I don't even know how to teach you to grow in the South or in the East where you've got
[04:05.470 --> 04:11.310]  a lot more humidity. The scheduling is a lot more wonky. The weather comes Midwest is a
[04:11.310 --> 04:16.430]  pretty similar to us, just a lot easier for them. So, all right, so we'll get it. We'll
[04:16.430 --> 04:20.310]  get most of this stuff based on Colorado grows, but we'll try to get it to where everybody
[04:20.310 --> 04:26.230]  can work with this. So I guess the first question we should start with is where, uh, where should
[04:26.230 --> 04:29.830]  we start growing? Where should we look at growing our outdoor crop? Where would be our
[04:29.830 --> 04:38.070]  ideal space? Um, you want a South facing, uh, you know, good, or good Southern view,
[04:38.070 --> 04:44.750]  um, for, for the sun. Um, starting this one off all stone. No, it's all right. It'll come
[04:44.750 --> 04:50.270]  out of you eventually. And I can edit some stuff for sure. No, no need for that. Um,
[04:50.270 --> 04:56.750]  you want, you know, probably six hours a day, direct sunlight. I mean, they'll grow on less,
[04:56.750 --> 05:04.910]  but you know, for proper, you know, you want six plus, um, or big fat lunch. Yeah. I'd
[05:04.910 --> 05:12.070]  prefer like 10 hours a day personally, but I mean, can make it work outdoors is really
[05:12.070 --> 05:18.070]  forgiving. So, um, they'll grow anywhere. Yeah, they will. They'll grow on accident
[05:18.070 --> 05:23.830]  sometimes. So you want a South facing, uh, slope if you can. Uh, what if we're stuck
[05:23.830 --> 05:29.630]  like in the city? What if we're in the backyard? Do we want to avoid some sheds, um, street
[05:29.630 --> 05:33.470]  lights, if you can street lights, most definitely sheds, you know, you don't want to get too
[05:33.470 --> 05:41.190]  blocked in. Um, and that is mainly for airflow. I mean, if your areas, you know, like in the
[05:41.190 --> 05:46.430]  middle of four sheds or something like that, I'll stack together, but it's 20 by 20, you
[05:46.430 --> 05:50.230]  know, you got plenty of airflow there for a couple of plants, leave some space. But
[05:50.230 --> 05:55.390]  you know, if it's like a six by six spot, you know, that's enough for one plant, maybe.
[05:55.390 --> 05:59.670]  Right. So yeah, you guys, your outdoor plants are going to get big if you do this right.
[05:59.670 --> 06:03.670]  And we'll talk about that in a few minutes when we talk about container size. So you
[06:03.670 --> 06:07.630]  need, you would like a Southern facing slope. Uh, if you're going to grow in your backyard
[06:07.630 --> 06:11.270]  or something, don't grow between the garage and the house and the shed, unless you can
[06:11.270 --> 06:15.630]  get plenty of air air flowing through there. That's going to be a great show. Jesse's too
[06:15.630 --> 06:18.910]  high in my throat. It's all jacked. It's going to be wonderful. Make sure you get plenty
[06:18.910 --> 06:22.550]  of airflow. You don't want your plants touching each other. So when you do plan them, make
[06:22.550 --> 06:26.790]  sure you give like, expect the plants to be six to eight feet around each by the time
[06:26.790 --> 06:29.510]  you're done, maybe a little bit bigger if you're a good grower and you know what you're
[06:29.510 --> 06:35.030]  doing. So expect a big plant. Give yourself plenty of room is kind of what I was headed
[06:35.030 --> 06:40.750]  toward. So we might be behind on this question, but, uh, here in Colorado, when should we
[06:40.750 --> 06:46.030]  put our plants outside? Um, pretty much anywhere in America. I think he could have been out
[06:46.350 --> 06:53.910]  a couple of weeks ago, probably. Oh, easily. Um, uh, you know, the, the summer we've had
[06:53.910 --> 06:58.710]  here locally, um, you could have been out at first to me easily. I'm going to ask a
[06:58.710 --> 07:04.990]  really random question. Uh, locally we've been getting beat to shit with hail every
[07:04.990 --> 07:09.670]  for two weeks. We had hail every night. How does one deal with torrential hailstorms like
[07:09.670 --> 07:15.350]  that in a ganja store and a ganja farm? Um, you get real good at seeing how storms come
[07:15.350 --> 07:24.350]  and you put the tarps up, you watch tarps, buckets. Um, that's with our in-ground plants.
[07:24.350 --> 07:30.310]  Uh, the hell storm that actually hit our place. Um, we were able to put 55 gallon trash buckets
[07:30.310 --> 07:36.910]  over each of the plants. Just flip it upside down and give it a little hut. Yeah. Um, you
[07:36.910 --> 07:41.230]  know, if they were bigger further in the season, we'll talk about a hoop house in a minute.
[07:41.230 --> 07:46.990]  Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you there. Um, did the hoop house get fucked up from
[07:46.990 --> 07:53.390]  that hail? Um, it had a shade cloth on it. Okay. So, um, we'll talk about a hoop house
[07:53.390 --> 07:56.750]  toward the end. I'll write that down. Cause that's, we talked about it on a previous episode,
[07:56.750 --> 08:01.110]  but we should kind of re rewind on that one when we can. Last year, it totally got fucked
[08:01.110 --> 08:05.670]  up by hell though. So it is very possible. So you guys, you're going to fuck some shit
[08:05.670 --> 08:10.070]  up. Don't be afraid. Like shit's going to go wrong, but you always get next year and
[08:10.070 --> 08:15.710]  you'll, you'll, you'll salvage something out of your harvest. Yeah. You almost always
[08:15.710 --> 08:20.910]  get something. Unless thieves or cops. That's the only thing that's going to take it all.
[08:20.910 --> 08:24.470]  That's funny. Cause I've got the word thieves and cops written on a note later on in this.
[08:24.470 --> 08:29.230]  I'm glad we were on the same page here. This is awesome. Uh, so, so we've got a few plants
[08:29.230 --> 08:36.590]  in, uh, ideally, ideally it would be on a field in Humboldt County or somewhere in Hula
[08:36.590 --> 08:42.910]  or out in Rye on a South facing slope with a big 18 foot tall chain link fence where
[08:42.910 --> 08:48.310]  nobody can get in. Uh, but that, that's not always going to happen for you. Uh, we're
[08:48.310 --> 08:51.550]  going to want these plants, plenty of space between them. You're going to want them outside.
[08:51.550 --> 08:55.110]  You're going to have to think about this weather. I'm kind of skipping ahead, but Jesse said
[08:55.110 --> 08:59.190]  you can put them out now. Then I thought about all the weather we've been getting. Uh, let's,
[08:59.190 --> 09:02.470]  let's just go right to the hoop house. Let's talk about that. Cause that seems to be the
[09:02.470 --> 09:07.350]  ideal outdoor. If people want to go outdoors cheap, uh, to protect everything. I think
[09:07.350 --> 09:15.750]  a hoop house might be, uh, yeah, that's also the best way to get the best resin, um, production
[09:15.750 --> 09:23.150]  in my opinion. Um, out just straight up outdoor tends to get dirty. And if you're making concentrates,
[09:23.150 --> 09:29.590]  you're going to make dust concentrate beaten by the sun. Um, uh, rained on, you know, all
[09:29.590 --> 09:34.750]  that good stuff. A simple hoop house covering, um, can save you a lot of headaches. It can
[09:34.750 --> 09:41.350]  create a couple too, but, um, as long as it's tall enough, you know, realize the stranger
[09:41.350 --> 09:45.390]  you're going to do a little research, figure out how much you're going to stretch. Or if
[09:45.390 --> 09:51.950]  you've done this before, you know, you'll, you know, what's up. Um, so plan for that.
[09:51.950 --> 09:57.390]  They're going to get big outside. Yeah. Yeah. Plant plan for the size. Um, and make sure
[09:57.390 --> 10:03.150]  you have plenty of airflow at the top of the greenhouse and at the bottom. So fresh
[10:03.150 --> 10:08.030]  air in and old staler out. It's just as important as in the grow and the humid air too. That's
[10:08.030 --> 10:14.310]  because the plants are transpiring and the plastic traps the water in there. So that's,
[10:14.310 --> 10:19.150]  you got to get that out of there. All right. Yeah. So let's, uh, real quickly, if you could
[10:19.150 --> 10:24.190]  describe to me how to build a, you know, just a hoop house that would fit in my backyard,
[10:24.190 --> 10:28.150]  you know, maybe just like a 10 by 20 at the biggest, what would be the most, the just,
[10:28.150 --> 10:32.110]  you know, two or three minutes worth of how to build a hoop house for sure. Real simple.
[10:32.110 --> 10:40.270]  Um, I'm trying to think how simple, um, I mean, start with the frame, the bottom. All
[10:40.270 --> 10:46.710]  right. So take like a, what size did you say? Uh, like a 10 by 20, 10 by 20, uh, get to
[10:46.710 --> 10:54.110]  20. Uh, so you'll need 40 foot of lumber there or 30 foot of lumber there. Um, no, twice
[10:54.110 --> 11:01.550]  that. Yeah. 60 foot. Yeah. There you go. But I get you. Um, I forgot to carry the two.
[11:01.550 --> 11:10.150]  Um, it, uh, uh, so build your frame, um, just like a big box, um, secure it to the ground.
[11:10.150 --> 11:14.310]  You don't even have to secure it to the ground, but it'll help the way shit's been around
[11:14.310 --> 11:21.310]  here lately. I would secure it. Um, and, uh, inside that frame, just bend your, your PVC
[11:21.310 --> 11:25.430]  tubes, you know, use like probably 20 foot tube or something like, or 20 foot stick on
[11:25.430 --> 11:31.630]  that. Um, and you know, that's going to end you up with, I think somewhere around a seven
[11:31.630 --> 11:37.870]  foot ceiling. I want to say, I'm not sure on that though. Um, but, uh, and then just
[11:37.870 --> 11:44.830]  continue down, um, you know, over 20 foot span, you'd probably want, I'd recommend at
[11:44.830 --> 11:49.350]  least seven, um, probably go for more like eight or nine.
[11:49.350 --> 11:52.910]  So what we're doing, he's, we, so you've got a rectangle, you've got a rectangle, it's
[11:52.910 --> 11:56.550]  a 10 by 20. And then what we're going to do, why we call it a hoop house, we're taking
[11:56.550 --> 12:00.550]  a PVC tubing and it almost looks like you're just using hula hoops and building a long
[12:00.550 --> 12:05.590]  tube, but you've make a, an arch from, and we're doing it the 10 foot to 10 foot side,
[12:05.590 --> 12:10.110]  not the 20 inch or the 20 foot. So you go from one 10, uh, you just make an arch and
[12:10.110 --> 12:13.830]  that way it makes it about seven feet tall and then it's 10 feet wide. And then you do
[12:13.830 --> 12:16.710]  those about every two or three, three or four feet.
[12:16.950 --> 12:25.030]  Yeah. Depending on how much wind, um, I, you know, here, um, in the Prairie and, uh, Southern
[12:25.030 --> 12:27.190]  Colorado, I'd probably recommend it three foot.
[12:27.190 --> 12:32.630]  All right. So it's about every three feet, put a, put another PVC, uh, tube and attach
[12:32.630 --> 12:38.390]  that to, uh, the box somehow to your base. Uh, what, what do you use to attach it?
[12:38.390 --> 12:39.990]  Um, like a conduit clamp.
[12:39.990 --> 12:41.270]  Perfect. That's what I, yeah.
[12:41.270 --> 12:46.590]  And then I also run a lag bolt through there. I only run one bolt through there and I drill
[12:46.590 --> 12:52.470]  it out. Um, I've had, um, what would you call it? Wallow them, wallow their way out
[12:52.470 --> 12:58.870]  and it rips the PVC. And then that's always fun when you get a, a springboarded PVC pipe,
[12:58.870 --> 13:03.110]  just flipping up in the middle of the night. Yeah.
[13:03.110 --> 13:07.590]  Catapult some shit across the grow. All right. So then you got the supports going over and
[13:07.590 --> 13:09.350]  then do you put one across the middle?
[13:09.350 --> 13:15.230]  Yeah. Um, I'd actually recommend three. Um, so if you're thinking of it like a clock,
[13:15.230 --> 13:21.830]  there'd be one at 12 o'clock, uh, one at nine o'clock and one at, uh, what would that
[13:21.830 --> 13:23.150]  be? Two or three? Yeah.
[13:23.150 --> 13:27.950]  Nine and three. All right. That makes sense. Okay. So they've got this like arch looking
[13:27.950 --> 13:33.190]  building with a beam that goes down the middle on the top and then down the three o'clock
[13:33.190 --> 13:38.030]  angle down the nine o'clock angle. Uh, that feels pretty secure. How do you attach that
[13:38.030 --> 13:42.230]  top pole and the side, uh, the beams that come across?
[13:42.230 --> 13:49.950]  Um, fence posts is the easiest way. Uh, just dig a fence post at the end of, um, uh, each
[13:49.950 --> 13:56.390]  end of the greenhouse on a 20 foot one. You might want one in the middle too. Um, and
[13:56.390 --> 14:01.470]  just arrange the size so that it meets up with that skeleton beam and fasten it to it
[14:01.470 --> 14:04.270]  with more, uh, conduit clamps.
[14:04.270 --> 14:07.630]  Okay. Sounds like you've done this several dozen times.
[14:07.630 --> 14:08.630]  Yes.
[14:09.030 --> 14:13.590]  All right. All right. So now pretty much looks like we've got the skeleton figured out basically.
[14:13.590 --> 14:18.470]  Right? Yeah. All right. Now, how do we, what do we use for a cover for a top for this thing
[14:18.470 --> 14:20.990]  to keep the hail and rain off of our beautiful plants?
[14:20.990 --> 14:31.270]  It depends on your budget. Um, if, you know, uh, if you're, you know, low end budget, um,
[14:31.270 --> 14:36.790]  a visqueen or just poly plastic from those works great. Uh, get the heavier, thicker
[14:36.790 --> 14:44.190]  mill. Um, and you know, if you got a better budget, uh, we sell greenhouse fabrics, uh,
[14:44.190 --> 14:50.350]  lots of places. So greenhouse fabrics. So, um, and it ranges, you know, if I want to
[14:50.350 --> 14:55.310]  say it somewhere, hell, I don't even know. I know it goes up to like 10 bucks a square
[14:55.310 --> 14:58.470]  foot. So, I mean, it starts off way cheaper than that.
[14:58.470 --> 14:59.470]  Okay. But 10 is high.
[14:59.470 --> 15:00.470]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[15:00.670 --> 15:03.910]  So you guys, you can afford this. If you guys work a little bit through the winter, you
[15:03.910 --> 15:08.590]  can build this next summer and you can definitely have you an outdoor. All right. So now we
[15:08.590 --> 15:12.110]  covered up, how do you secure the, uh, the cover there?
[15:12.110 --> 15:22.230]  Um, um, and what do they call them? Uh, it looks like a battery, uh, uh, jumper cable
[15:22.230 --> 15:23.230]  clamp.
[15:23.230 --> 15:24.230]  Oh, okay. A little alligator clamp.
[15:24.230 --> 15:25.230]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[15:25.230 --> 15:26.230]  But better, but stronger.
[15:26.230 --> 15:28.950]  Yeah. We, we call them spring clamps, but I don't think that's what the
[15:28.950 --> 15:29.950]  Nipple clamps.
[15:29.950 --> 15:32.310]  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Framing clamps.
[15:32.310 --> 15:35.270]  All right. All right. So that makes a lot of sense.
[15:35.270 --> 15:37.630]  Yeah. We get them for like two 50 at Harbor freight.
[15:37.630 --> 15:39.950]  All right. So go buy a whole bucket of those things.
[15:39.950 --> 15:42.950]  Yeah. Literally. I've gotten in there and bought like four buckets of them.
[15:42.950 --> 15:43.950]  Yeah.
[15:43.950 --> 15:44.950]  What are you doing?
[15:44.950 --> 15:49.870]  Don't ask lady. Don't ask. Yeah. All right. So you got this little hoop house. Uh, you
[15:49.870 --> 15:54.430]  should put a fan in the top guys, like in one of the peaks at the end, cut out the shape
[15:54.430 --> 15:58.830]  of the fan and hang a fan in there because you're going to need to get some air in and
[15:59.710 --> 16:02.910]  out. If you can do a blower, like a grow room blower, that's even cooler.
[16:02.910 --> 16:03.910]  Those work great on the ground.
[16:03.910 --> 16:05.430]  Okay. Do one coming in.
[16:05.430 --> 16:10.870]  Uh, yeah. One thing that sucks about those is though, uh, they suck up rocks and a lot
[16:10.870 --> 16:16.230]  of them have plastic blades in them. So take you a piece of ducting that's, I don't know,
[16:16.230 --> 16:20.950]  like three foot long and secure it to the side of the greenhouse, lift it up a little
[16:20.950 --> 16:25.230]  bit higher, attach it to the fan so that it can't suck any rocks off.
[16:25.230 --> 16:30.710]  Yeah. Oh man. I can just, I, I don't want to know what that sounds like. Yeah. It sounds
[16:30.710 --> 16:35.470]  like like keys in the blender. I could imagine. All right. So we've got air in, we've got
[16:35.470 --> 16:41.150]  air out. We've got a nice little greenhouse. Um, I don't want, I'm going to save that question
[16:41.150 --> 16:44.470]  right there. What kind of soil should we use?
[16:44.470 --> 16:48.270]  That depends on your budget and just your growth style. Really? I mean, should we put
[16:48.270 --> 16:55.150]  them straight into the dirt? Do you think, or should we use pots?
[16:55.270 --> 17:00.390]  It, you know, it also depends on your location. I would tend to recommend pots, even though
[17:00.390 --> 17:06.310]  I would rather be able to recommend planting in the ground. But, um, there's a little more
[17:06.310 --> 17:13.110]  to that. Um, if you go get like a 30 gallon smart pot, um, outdoors, I recommend the fabric
[17:13.110 --> 17:20.310]  pots. Um, and they, they sell the tan ones now too, which are great because, um, they
[17:20.310 --> 17:26.830]  reflect heat a little better than the black ones that tend to absorb heat. Um, but you
[17:26.830 --> 17:31.910]  know, I mean, if you just went with your favorite potting soil, um, just, you know, I recommend
[17:31.910 --> 17:36.630]  probably going three times bigger than your typical indoor container. Okay. Large containers
[17:36.630 --> 17:41.390]  for outdoors, large containers, stick with your regular nutrient schedule, you know,
[17:41.390 --> 17:46.750]  stick with what you're comfortable with. Um, you know, if you want to do organics, I could
[17:46.750 --> 17:48.830]  spend a whole episode talking about,
[17:48.950 --> 17:53.150]  there are some episodes with Sean, you guys are all about amending soil and there are
[17:53.150 --> 17:54.470]  great outdoor mixes in there.
[17:54.510 --> 18:00.390]  I mean, that's personally the way I grow. Um, half of my plant, I mean, we do six plants
[18:00.390 --> 18:04.350]  in the ground and we do six plants in the light depth greenhouse. Um, the ones in the
[18:04.350 --> 18:09.990]  ground have been in that, I've been grown in that soil for eight years now. Um, the
[18:09.990 --> 18:17.430]  ones in the greenhouse get my homemade mixture, which is real similar to, I don't know, roots.
[18:18.510 --> 18:19.830]  Roots organic is good stuff.
[18:19.870 --> 18:20.190]  Yeah.
[18:20.430 --> 18:20.790]  All right.
[18:20.830 --> 18:25.630]  And they get that, you know, personally I grow organic, so they get teas and I've been
[18:25.630 --> 18:28.030]  playing around with ferments and stuff like that, but
[18:28.230 --> 18:32.590]  don't they love a nice tea? Oh man. You can see the growth. If you feed them a nice tea,
[18:32.590 --> 18:33.750]  those plants take off.
[18:33.750 --> 18:35.310]  Especially with the Kashi juice.
[18:35.350 --> 18:35.790]  Yeah.
[18:36.750 --> 18:41.550]  All right. So now we've got these plants in a nice Kashi juice. Oh, I could go off on a
[18:41.550 --> 18:45.710]  whole rant about that. That one, it almost flew over my head, but that's Kashi juice.
[18:45.710 --> 18:47.510]  I still don't know what, what is that?
[18:47.510 --> 18:48.430]  A lab?
[18:48.830 --> 18:49.870]  Lactic acid bacteria.
[18:49.870 --> 18:50.070]  Yeah.
[18:50.070 --> 18:50.350]  Yeah.
[18:50.350 --> 18:50.550]  Yeah.
[18:50.630 --> 18:54.270]  And it's a, that purple stuff and the fungi see stuff looking stuff is basically great
[18:54.270 --> 18:54.550]  white.
[18:55.030 --> 18:55.670]  Oh yeah.
[18:55.670 --> 18:55.870]  Yeah.
[18:55.870 --> 18:56.710]  Great white shark.
[18:56.710 --> 18:58.230]  I have all kinds of names for it.
[18:58.230 --> 19:02.630]  Dude, it smells like vomit. It smells like beard, bar trash can puke.
[19:02.670 --> 19:02.910]  Yeah.
[19:02.910 --> 19:03.190]  Yeah.
[19:03.590 --> 19:03.910]  Yeah.
[19:04.270 --> 19:08.310]  All right. So we've got this a nice little light depth greenhouse. We've got some
[19:08.310 --> 19:12.230]  plants in a really large pots or not light depth. It's just a little hoop house. I
[19:12.230 --> 19:14.870]  mean, we didn't do light depth on this episode. We may discuss that a little more
[19:14.870 --> 19:16.270]  in the future. We've done it once.
[19:16.430 --> 19:16.590]  Yeah.
[19:16.630 --> 19:17.190]  We may cover it.
[19:17.190 --> 19:21.150]  If you're interested in the light depth, it's a, you put the plastic on, you take
[19:21.150 --> 19:21.590]  it off.
[19:21.630 --> 19:22.030]  Um,
[19:23.230 --> 19:27.110]  you get another tarp to cover up the sun so that you can schedule the bitches to go
[19:27.110 --> 19:27.470]  to sleep.
[19:27.470 --> 19:28.910]  Every night at a specific time.
[19:28.950 --> 19:33.550]  You could teach anyone to do it. So, and we talk about it in a, in a past
[19:33.590 --> 19:34.110]  episode.
[19:34.230 --> 19:38.510]  Yeah. Uh, we'll, we'll go more over that one in the future also. Uh, so you got
[19:38.510 --> 19:42.510]  them in this little hoop house. You've got large pots with decent soil. You're
[19:42.510 --> 19:46.910]  feeding, uh, nutrients that you're familiar with or a bottle nutrient line
[19:46.950 --> 19:51.790]  because that's probably cost effective. If not, our friend Sean will teach you a
[19:51.790 --> 19:55.270]  great soil recipe. Uh, I'll find the episode number and insert that in the
[19:55.270 --> 19:55.750]  notes.
[19:56.030 --> 20:01.750]  Um, outdoor plants tend to use a little more food, food. Um, okay. When I've
[20:01.750 --> 20:06.750]  grown bottle nutrients outdoors, uh, we normally feed to the top end of the
[20:06.750 --> 20:12.430]  recommendation. If maybe even just a little over, um, you know, this was with
[20:12.550 --> 20:14.190]  general organic specifically.
[20:14.870 --> 20:17.830]  Yeah. Because the plants can metabolize more because of the sun and the more
[20:17.830 --> 20:20.470]  available CO2 and the bigger root mass. So
[20:20.670 --> 20:23.350]  you think your Govitas are bad-ass. They ain't got nothing on that.
[20:23.350 --> 20:24.710]  Yeah. The sun will kick.
[20:26.230 --> 20:29.310]  Uh, somebody asked me what kind of lights to use. And I was like, Govitas.
[20:29.310 --> 20:33.310]  And they're like, I've got low ceilings. I was like, yeah, stick with your like
[20:33.310 --> 20:39.230]  Lumitex or whatever. Yeah. Those magnums or whatever. All right. So now when
[20:39.230 --> 20:41.270]  should we expect to see signs of flower?
[20:42.310 --> 20:45.710]  Um, late July, early August in Southern Colorado.
[20:45.750 --> 20:47.710]  Depends on what strains we're working with. I'd imagine.
[20:47.750 --> 20:53.750]  That too. Um, Indica's seem to tend, or I would say in my experience, Indica's
[20:53.750 --> 20:55.430]  get a little quicker around here. So.
[20:55.430 --> 20:59.030]  Very true. The flow will take off. Blueberry will be almost done by the time
[20:59.310 --> 21:00.830]  Goat spits out pistols.
[21:01.030 --> 21:06.470]  Uh, my government mule just kills it outdoors. Like it's, it's great.
[21:08.150 --> 21:12.230]  All right. Um, so speaking of mules, I'm just joking. Uh, that is kind of good
[21:12.230 --> 21:15.430]  though. What kind of problems do you think we should tell the people to be
[21:15.430 --> 21:16.270]  prepared for?
[21:16.750 --> 21:20.830]  Um, we get those damn little moths.
[21:21.150 --> 21:21.670]  Oh yeah.
[21:21.670 --> 21:23.510]  And they, they lay eggs.
[21:23.630 --> 21:24.790]  Into caterpillars.
[21:25.230 --> 21:32.310]  Yeah. And they bore into your bud. Um, if you're doing light dip and it's early
[21:32.310 --> 21:38.510]  season, um, you gotta watch out for molds, um, bud rot, stuff like that.
[21:39.150 --> 21:39.750]  Um,
[21:40.150 --> 21:42.670]  is that something that can be stopped once it's happened?
[21:43.510 --> 21:50.670]  Um, mold. Um, I mean, we could spend, well, I don't know if PMs of a bastard.
[21:50.750 --> 21:50.990]  Uh,
[21:50.990 --> 21:51.830]  yes, I agree.
[21:52.070 --> 21:58.070]  Um, I mean, I personally don't think, you know, a little on a family fear there
[21:58.070 --> 22:02.110]  right before harvest is one thing. If it's on the bud, it's done in my opinion.
[22:02.190 --> 22:02.670]  I agree.
[22:02.710 --> 22:10.190]  Bud rot. Um, I have just seen that for the first time this year ever. Um, and it
[22:10.190 --> 22:15.110]  was in, it was in another light dip. Um, they didn't have good air circulation.
[22:15.190 --> 22:15.870]  Um,
[22:16.510 --> 22:18.510]  once again, guys get that circulation up.
[22:18.630 --> 22:25.150]  We've had a very rainy spring, um, and lots of hell and everything is just, the
[22:25.150 --> 22:30.470]  humidity has been so much higher than a lot of outdoor growers are used to dealing
[22:30.470 --> 22:31.990]  with, um, around here.
[22:32.070 --> 22:32.390]  Yeah.
[22:32.470 --> 22:32.830]  So,
[22:32.910 --> 22:35.710]  and we're using swamp coolers to try to cool the house on top of that.
[22:35.750 --> 22:41.750]  His loss or his harvest was by no means a total loss. Um, you know, he probably
[22:42.310 --> 22:46.710]  lost a plant, you know, combined out of, I think he did 12 plants in there or
[22:46.710 --> 22:47.310]  something like that.
[22:47.350 --> 22:48.470]  So, okay. That's not bad.
[22:48.550 --> 22:48.950]  Yeah.
[22:49.070 --> 22:52.270]  I mean, that's the, the rule of averages with growing weed.
[22:52.510 --> 22:57.470]  It's not like it was PM where like you can smell it on buds that weren't even
[22:57.470 --> 23:01.230]  affected and stuff like that. Like, or at least what I've seen so far.
[23:02.630 --> 23:05.230]  Uh, how do we deal with animals? What kind of animals do you think we're going
[23:05.230 --> 23:05.630]  to get?
[23:05.870 --> 23:12.030]  Um, you know, it depends on where you live. Uh, deer love it. Cows love it.
[23:12.470 --> 23:17.990]  Every, everything that eats stuff loves it. Um, especially when it's well cared
[23:17.990 --> 23:25.150]  for. So, um, if you know, you know, just prepare for the animals in your area.
[23:25.230 --> 23:26.670]  Um, even cats and dogs,
[23:28.710 --> 23:31.750]  all the domestic fucking pest animals are going to come at it too. So be
[23:31.750 --> 23:35.390]  prepared somehow. Like you got to section it off somehow. So these animals don't
[23:35.390 --> 23:39.470]  get to it. Should we treat for bugs outdoors? My theory on outdoor growing,
[23:39.670 --> 23:42.910]  you can correct me if I'm wrong. You're the outdoor guy. I feel like if we don't
[23:42.910 --> 23:46.070]  fuck with nature, nature will kind of take care of itself for us. Like, I feel
[23:46.070 --> 23:50.510]  like if I spray, I'm going to upset the whole system and a bug that wouldn't
[23:50.510 --> 23:53.750]  normally dominate will dominate because whatever should have been there to eat,
[23:53.750 --> 23:55.230]  it will be gone. Is that kind of right?
[23:55.470 --> 24:00.550]  And like where I grow, I totally agree with that. Um, we use very minimal
[24:00.550 --> 24:08.870]  pesticides. Um, very strategic timing, um, in a greenhouse. Um, you know, it
[24:08.870 --> 24:12.590]  depends on how sealed up your greenhouses. Um, a lot of times it's
[24:12.590 --> 24:19.750]  just like a girl room environment. Um, so, uh, just don't overdo it. You know,
[24:19.870 --> 24:27.750]  it's, um, it is a lot harder for insects and parasites to survive outside. Um, I
[24:27.750 --> 24:31.630]  mean, it's the best grow room in the world. It's, it's got perfect air flow
[24:31.630 --> 24:32.150]  and everything.
[24:32.150 --> 24:33.510]  Yeah. And the sun.
[24:33.550 --> 24:38.630]  Yeah. As long as the plants are happy, aren't stressed out. You know, I think
[24:39.310 --> 24:42.310]  A's and Mac's probably the strongest thing I've ever used outdoors.
[24:42.470 --> 24:44.070]  How do you feel about a spinosad?
[24:44.590 --> 24:47.590]  Uh, that's great stuff. Um, that's something you can do to go after the
[24:47.590 --> 24:52.070]  moths and stuff like that. Uh, that's a something, I mean, we have bees on our
[24:52.070 --> 24:57.630]  property too, so that's a, you know, always a consideration. Um, but spinosad
[24:57.630 --> 25:02.510]  is something that, you know, we don't really worry about it all. Um, it's,
[25:02.510 --> 25:06.230]  it's totally natural. It's like spraying the tea on the plants, which we do.
[25:06.350 --> 25:10.350]  It's actually a, it derives from a bacteria found in the bottle of a rum
[25:10.350 --> 25:15.110]  jar or the bottom of a rum jar or a brum barrel.
[25:16.350 --> 25:17.910]  I think the wood has something to do with it.
[25:17.950 --> 25:22.670]  Yeah, for sure. For sure. I read that a long time ago somewhere. All right. Uh,
[25:22.670 --> 25:27.550]  so captain Jack's yeah. Captain Jack's to the rescue sometimes. So we talked
[25:27.550 --> 25:30.310]  about all the weather. You guys be prepared for a lot of weather. You're
[25:30.310 --> 25:33.550]  going to get heat. You're going to get hail. You're going to get rain. You're
[25:33.550 --> 25:37.470]  going to get wind. It's going to be treacherous out there. Uh, imagine
[25:37.470 --> 25:40.430]  being stuck outside all the time and not being able to come inside. You're
[25:40.430 --> 25:43.670]  gonna have to prepare for your plants. You need to build them in a doghouse or
[25:43.670 --> 25:47.390]  something. They need love. All right. Also something I thought we should
[25:47.390 --> 25:51.270]  mention is be prepared for a lot of watering. I don't know if you guys are
[25:51.270 --> 25:55.750]  prepared or realize how much water your outdoor plants are going to take. Uh,
[25:55.750 --> 26:02.350]  how often do you water your outdoor plants, Jesse? Um, well, up until, you
[26:02.350 --> 26:06.910]  know, normally it's once a day. Um, this year has been a little different.
[26:06.930 --> 26:10.790]  I haven't had to water as much. We've got a lot of rain. It's actually been a
[26:10.790 --> 26:15.070]  pain in the fucking ass. Uh, my, some of my plants are severely stunted because
[26:15.070 --> 26:19.870]  of it. So, um, don't catch up though. So, yeah, it'll dry out here pretty
[26:19.870 --> 26:25.630]  soon. Yeah, we'll be missing that evening rain. Yeah. So, uh, what else
[26:25.630 --> 26:28.430]  was I going to ask you in the middle of flowering when they start budding out
[26:28.430 --> 26:33.070]  in the summer? Are you going to be watering them twice? Uh, probably so. Um,
[26:33.190 --> 26:38.830]  in ground plants don't need to be watered as much if you water them right.
[26:39.150 --> 26:47.470]  You know, um, 15, 20 gallons at a time. Um, it's, it's a workout when we do, um,
[26:47.830 --> 26:54.070]  outdoor in ground water. Um, in the greenhouse, I use automated systems. So
[26:55.030 --> 27:00.430]  I put a little sprinklers and everything and yeah, that shit's yeah. Screw that
[27:00.430 --> 27:06.630]  shit. Um, but that just tells you how much water, um, you know, even smart
[27:06.630 --> 27:13.030]  pots need outdoors. Um, the, the sun just bakes those pots, uh, go to Lowe's or
[27:13.030 --> 27:17.230]  something like that. Just feel the side of one of their, you know, of a rose pot
[27:17.230 --> 27:22.630]  or something like that sitting outside. Um, and I mean, this, the sun just bakes
[27:22.670 --> 27:27.230]  it, it gets so fucking hot and that gets your roots hot. Um, which they can
[27:27.230 --> 27:31.430]  survive. They just need plenty of water to be able to handle it. So, okay. Um,
[27:31.510 --> 27:34.990]  also you said to put mulch on top of your pots also to kind of shade them a
[27:34.990 --> 27:40.110]  little, keep moisture in. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, in ground or in the pots. Um, another
[27:40.110 --> 27:45.630]  thing, if you do have black pots outside, I recommend, uh, wrapping them in
[27:45.630 --> 27:49.870]  panda plastic with the white side out. Um, make them a little reflective. Yeah.
[27:50.830 --> 27:54.990]  So it seems to me, I did that three started doing that three years ago and
[27:54.990 --> 27:59.990]  it seemed to make a difference. So that's, yeah. Um, what I'd like to figure
[27:59.990 --> 28:05.030]  out for these people is, uh, some no-till, um, talk with Sean, some future
[28:05.030 --> 28:08.110]  stuff about it. So yeah, no-till is neat. I've been looking into that.
[28:09.150 --> 28:12.710]  This year it was kind of a last minute opportunity for him. So once they got
[28:12.830 --> 28:16.910]  the required licensing and everything, they just went with what they had. So,
[28:17.030 --> 28:17.230]  yeah.
[28:18.550 --> 28:19.910]  Um, which wasn't much.
[28:22.350 --> 28:25.190]  All right. Before my computer starts tripping out too much here. Uh, do you
[28:25.190 --> 28:28.030]  have any tips for the people that are starting to grow outdoors for the first
[28:28.030 --> 28:35.670]  time this year? Um, water a lot. Um, if you're in ground, um, just make sure the
[28:35.670 --> 28:41.590]  water's soaking down into the soil. Um, once it starts pulling up, um, give it a
[28:41.590 --> 28:45.470]  minute, you know, see how long it takes it for it to drain down into the soil
[28:45.510 --> 28:50.990]  that gives you a real good indication of, um, how damp the soil is. Cause
[28:50.990 --> 28:55.150]  that, you know, a container is easy. You just got to pick it up. Um, you know,
[28:55.230 --> 29:00.350]  and you should be able to through trial and error, figure out how, uh, how much
[29:00.350 --> 29:03.910]  water to put in it, how much it should weigh, how long it takes to dry out. Um,
[29:04.310 --> 29:09.910]  the, the earth can be a little more challenging, um, uh, to aid in that
[29:09.910 --> 29:14.950]  watering, put a frame around the plant, like a three foot by three foot, two by
[29:14.950 --> 29:19.950]  four frame and just put it on the ground. You can also attach, uh, the big
[29:19.950 --> 29:25.550]  crazy, uh, tomato cages or, you know, plant cages made out of fencing to them
[29:25.550 --> 29:26.670]  later on. So
[29:27.270 --> 29:30.590]  prune them out and pull them out a little bit, get light down in. Okay.
[29:30.670 --> 29:31.950]  I'm getting a frog in my throat.
[29:32.950 --> 29:36.470]  Well, uh, let's, uh, let's wrap it up. We've been going for 30 minutes now.
[29:36.750 --> 29:39.470]  That's enough of a podcast for these guys. We'll let your throat take a break.
[29:39.470 --> 29:42.750]  My throat finally is not blown out. So it's a good time to do a closing here.
[29:42.950 --> 29:43.790]  Take some tabs.
[29:43.830 --> 29:47.830]  Yeah, we'll take some dabs. Now we'll save some stuff for next time here. Uh,
