[00:02.430 --> 00:26.060]  Alright, here we go.
[00:26.060 --> 00:27.540]  Welcome to the show, Ganja Farmers.
[00:27.540 --> 00:28.540]  I'm your host.
[00:28.540 --> 00:30.380]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:30.380 --> 00:35.660]  This is episode 714 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.660 --> 00:39.980]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about growing feminized seeds and working with feminized
[00:39.980 --> 00:41.060]  plants.
[00:41.060 --> 00:44.580]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:44.580 --> 00:48.940]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:48.940 --> 00:51.420]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:51.420 --> 00:52.420]  Thank you.
[00:52.420 --> 00:53.500]  Shout out to Danny Dave.
[00:53.500 --> 00:55.780]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to our buddy Bob.
[00:55.780 --> 00:58.520]  Let's send a thank you to Alabama Man and JG.
[00:58.520 --> 01:02.020]  Let's send a big salute and a fist bump and a thank you shout out to the captain and commander
[01:02.020 --> 01:05.260]  of the Irie Army, my friend Lemur Priest.
[01:05.260 --> 01:08.900]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Billy Podunk holding it down in Alaska.
[01:08.900 --> 01:12.780]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Brian P and EZ 057.
[01:12.780 --> 01:15.380]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb.
[01:15.380 --> 01:18.980]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to my buddy Guy Yudi Grows.
[01:18.980 --> 01:22.940]  Let's send a thank you to Blackhawks fan and Matt H. Then let's wrap it all up with a big
[01:22.940 --> 01:24.700]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:24.700 --> 01:25.700]  Thank you.
[01:25.700 --> 01:27.300]  Shout out to TreeumUp.
[01:27.300 --> 01:32.260]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:32.260 --> 01:35.980]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:35.980 --> 01:42.140]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:42.140 --> 01:44.860]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:44.860 --> 01:49.180]  And you know, I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:49.180 --> 01:52.620]  everything nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:52.620 --> 01:55.500]  I do want to make one quick update, maybe an announcement.
[01:55.500 --> 02:00.260]  A lot of times when you sign up for Patreon, you type in a name and that is now your Patreon
[02:00.260 --> 02:01.420]  account name.
[02:01.420 --> 02:05.300]  Some people put their regular name, some people put their full name, some people make up a
[02:05.300 --> 02:08.140]  cool name and put Guy Yudy Gros in there.
[02:08.140 --> 02:10.080]  Some people have Lemur Priest in there.
[02:10.080 --> 02:13.260]  Some people, however, are just putting their real full government name in there.
[02:13.260 --> 02:17.700]  I don't know if you want me to say your real legal name on the show.
[02:17.700 --> 02:20.340]  I understand that that could get you in some trouble.
[02:20.340 --> 02:24.020]  Maybe your coworkers, your boss, your friends, maybe your wife finds out that you're contributing
[02:24.020 --> 02:25.980]  to the Patreon and she doesn't want that.
[02:25.980 --> 02:27.580]  I don't want you to get in any trouble.
[02:27.580 --> 02:32.300]  So if I'm saying the wrong name or if I haven't said your name and you're concerned, simply
[02:32.620 --> 02:37.460]  me a message on Patreon and let me know what your name is under on the account and let
[02:37.460 --> 02:40.900]  me know what the corrected name I should say on the show is.
[02:40.900 --> 02:43.020]  I do have an update from one person here.
[02:43.020 --> 02:47.100]  I've been possibly saying the wrong name, but they do want me to give a shout out to
[02:47.100 --> 02:49.380]  Oh Cannabis 613.
[02:49.380 --> 02:51.820]  So big shout out to Oh Cannabis 613.
[02:51.820 --> 02:52.820]  You're getting a shout out.
[02:52.820 --> 02:57.820]  I'm not sure from this message, I'm not sure if that was the message was from Oh Cannabis
[02:57.820 --> 03:01.580]  or if their friend paid for this shout out.
[03:02.580 --> 03:06.500]  But either way, if I'm not saying the correct name, because I've called a couple of people
[03:06.500 --> 03:11.380]  the wrong name for several episodes, just update me, correct me, send me an email.
[03:11.380 --> 03:13.700]  This is a cannabis podcast.
[03:13.700 --> 03:18.220]  That means I do consume cannabis before, after, and possibly during this show.
[03:18.220 --> 03:21.980]  If I have forgotten, if I have failed to make the adjustments and corrections, simply send
[03:21.980 --> 03:22.980]  me another email.
[03:22.980 --> 03:23.980]  Send me a nudge.
[03:23.980 --> 03:24.980]  We'll get it corrected.
[03:24.980 --> 03:26.380]  I'll say the right thing on the show.
[03:26.380 --> 03:27.380]  All right.
[03:27.380 --> 03:29.620]  So once again, big shout out to our buddy Oh Cannabis 613.
[03:30.620 --> 03:32.980]  Not sure if that came from you or your friend.
[03:32.980 --> 03:33.980]  Either way, big love.
[03:33.980 --> 03:36.420]  Thanks for the support to both of you or you.
[03:36.420 --> 03:37.740]  I'm confused.
[03:37.740 --> 03:40.020]  I do have a real topic for this podcast here.
[03:40.020 --> 03:41.940]  I've got a screenshot here in my phone.
[03:41.940 --> 03:43.300]  I'm going to grab the phone.
[03:43.300 --> 03:44.660]  No, I'm not flirting with anybody.
[03:44.660 --> 03:46.900]  I'm not scrolling Instagram looking at butts and boobs.
[03:46.900 --> 03:48.980]  I am actually reading a message here on the screen.
[03:48.980 --> 03:50.220]  I'm looking for it.
[03:50.220 --> 03:52.660]  This one, I found this on YouTube.
[03:52.660 --> 03:53.660]  I've said this before.
[03:53.660 --> 03:56.880]  I prefer not to take the comments from the YouTube channel.
[03:56.880 --> 04:01.000]  It's much easier to capture them and print them and use them here on the show when they
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.560]  come through either an email or the grow help tab on the website.
[04:04.560 --> 04:06.880]  Let's talk about that before we even get to this.
[04:06.880 --> 04:10.440]  On the website, iReGenetics.com, there is a grow help tab.
[04:10.440 --> 04:12.240]  There's a tab that says grow help.
[04:12.240 --> 04:16.280]  If you have questions or need grow help with your plants, all you have to do is fill out
[04:16.280 --> 04:18.360]  a quick, it's like a questionnaire.
[04:18.360 --> 04:22.040]  It's like basically asking your blood pressure, height and weight, but we do it about the
[04:22.040 --> 04:23.040]  plants.
[04:23.040 --> 04:24.040]  What are you growing?
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.040]  Are you indoors?
[04:25.040 --> 04:26.040]  Are you outdoors?
[04:26.200 --> 04:27.960]  Are you using LED, HPS, ceramic metal halide?
[04:27.960 --> 04:30.320]  Are you using campfire and flashlights?
[04:30.320 --> 04:31.400]  What kind of soil are you in?
[04:31.400 --> 04:32.400]  Are you using hydro?
[04:32.400 --> 04:33.400]  What are you doing?
[04:33.400 --> 04:34.400]  I want to know some questions.
[04:34.400 --> 04:38.920]  Then I give you an opportunity to type in your question and ask what you need help with.
[04:38.920 --> 04:45.320]  The reason I ask so many preliminary questions is because people say, why are my plants yellow?
[04:45.320 --> 04:47.640]  I'm like, well, that could be a billion things.
[04:47.640 --> 04:52.080]  With that little questionnaire, that little preview, that little survey, that helps me
[04:52.080 --> 04:55.780]  get an idea of what's going on with your plants in your grow room.
[04:56.520 --> 04:58.420]  It answers all the questions I was going to reply with anyway.
[04:58.420 --> 04:59.860]  It saves us a step.
[04:59.860 --> 05:03.620]  If you've got grow questions, if you need grow help, I do recommend the grow help tab
[05:03.620 --> 05:05.500]  on ieregenetics.com.
[05:05.500 --> 05:06.940]  That goes straight to the phone.
[05:06.940 --> 05:08.600]  When you send that message, it goes to my phone.
[05:08.600 --> 05:09.600]  My phone jingles.
[05:09.600 --> 05:10.600]  I will check that.
[05:10.600 --> 05:11.600]  Then I will print it.
[05:11.600 --> 05:12.820]  It'll end up in paper.
[05:12.820 --> 05:14.060]  That's the best way to get it on the show.
[05:14.060 --> 05:15.140]  I've got papers piled up.
[05:15.140 --> 05:18.100]  I know which episode they go to, their paper clip together.
[05:18.100 --> 05:19.300]  That's just my organization.
[05:19.300 --> 05:20.540]  It's easier that way.
[05:20.540 --> 05:22.100]  However, I did like this one.
[05:22.100 --> 05:23.180]  This one came from YouTube.
[05:23.180 --> 05:26.260]  I'm not going to read a lot of them from YouTube because it's harder to find them.
[05:26.260 --> 05:29.620]  It's harder to print them, keep them, access them, file them.
[05:29.620 --> 05:30.620]  This one was good.
[05:30.620 --> 05:33.120]  I'm fucking high and rambly, but it's going to work out.
[05:33.120 --> 05:36.780]  This one goes a little bit a lot, if not just like this.
[05:36.780 --> 05:40.060]  It says, can I do this with feminized seeds?
[05:40.060 --> 05:41.740]  Then they ask a question.
[05:41.740 --> 05:42.980]  Clone a P1.
[05:42.980 --> 05:44.700]  That basically means grow a plant.
[05:44.700 --> 05:47.140]  You've grown your parent, your P1.
[05:47.140 --> 05:50.220]  We're going to clone the P1, which was feminized.
[05:50.220 --> 05:51.620]  We've assumed this was feminized.
[05:51.620 --> 05:53.540]  They're asking about fem seeds.
[05:53.540 --> 05:54.980]  Clone the P1.
[05:54.980 --> 06:00.160]  Use colloidal silver on one clone and use that to pollinate multiple plants.
[06:00.160 --> 06:02.380]  So far, yes, you can absolutely do that.
[06:02.380 --> 06:03.380]  That's what I do.
[06:03.380 --> 06:05.020]  That is what is commonly done.
[06:05.020 --> 06:09.140]  We're going to take a P1 plant and we're going to clone that.
[06:09.140 --> 06:10.700]  We're going to reverse one.
[06:10.700 --> 06:12.660]  Then we're going to do what I call pollen chucking.
[06:12.660 --> 06:17.140]  We're going to put that pollen on a cut of the same thing and a cut of other things.
[06:17.140 --> 06:19.020]  Now we've got a breeding project.
[06:19.020 --> 06:20.820]  We're off to a good start here so far.
[06:20.820 --> 06:21.820]  Makes sense.
[06:21.820 --> 06:22.820]  I get it.
[06:22.820 --> 06:23.820]  It goes on though.
[06:23.820 --> 06:27.100]  It says, now I'm going to take another P1 clone and spray that.
[06:27.100 --> 06:30.700]  Cross that with the seeds from the first batch and that should give me F2 seeds.
[06:30.700 --> 06:31.700]  Right.
[06:31.700 --> 06:32.700]  Thanks, buddy.
[06:32.700 --> 06:33.780]  I've been watching you more and more lately.
[06:33.780 --> 06:37.100]  Big shout out to our friend, Sean Cross from the YouTube.
[06:37.100 --> 06:39.500]  I'm not sure.
[06:39.500 --> 06:42.420]  There's parts of this question that I have questions about.
[06:42.420 --> 06:44.360]  So I'm going to clarify that right here.
[06:44.360 --> 06:50.680]  When you say, then take another P1 clone and spray that, if that P1 ... So what you have
[06:50.680 --> 06:55.200]  to do now, if you want to make the F2, there's a specific step because you could mess this
[06:55.200 --> 06:56.200]  up.
[06:56.200 --> 07:00.320]  Let me try to clarify the question and then I'm going to, of course, ramble on Rose about
[07:00.320 --> 07:01.320]  this.
[07:01.320 --> 07:07.360]  If ... So you're going to take a plant and it does not matter if it's feminized or non-feminized.
[07:07.360 --> 07:09.400]  I'm going to talk ... That's going to be the main chunk of this podcast.
[07:09.400 --> 07:12.520]  Let me scroll up and get myself to that part of the notes.
[07:12.680 --> 07:14.880]  We're going to talk about that part a lot here.
[07:14.880 --> 07:17.000]  But let me get myself back on track.
[07:17.000 --> 07:18.640]  So we're going to take a feminized plant.
[07:18.640 --> 07:20.680]  It doesn't matter at this point if it's regular or feminized.
[07:20.680 --> 07:21.840]  It is all the same.
[07:21.840 --> 07:24.080]  That's what I'm going to ramble about in a moment here.
[07:24.080 --> 07:25.140]  We're going to take a plant.
[07:25.140 --> 07:26.140]  We're going to clone it.
[07:26.140 --> 07:27.940]  And then just like I said, we're going to reverse it.
[07:27.940 --> 07:29.660]  You can use silver thiosulfate.
[07:29.660 --> 07:31.560]  You can use colloidal silver.
[07:31.560 --> 07:35.520]  Whatever works best for your situation, your experience, go ahead, do that.
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.520]  Reverse it.
[07:36.520 --> 07:37.520]  Chuck some pollen.
[07:37.520 --> 07:38.520]  Now you're going to make seeds.
[07:38.560 --> 07:45.840]  Now to make F2, which is the second filial generation, you have to take seeds, a batch
[07:45.840 --> 07:47.880]  of those seeds that come from the same plant.
[07:47.880 --> 07:52.680]  So let's just say you took a golden goat and you pollinated lemon skunk.
[07:52.680 --> 07:55.240]  Now you've now made lemon jeffery.
[07:55.240 --> 07:58.260]  It's an R1, also technically can be an F1.
[07:58.260 --> 08:00.560]  For this case, we're going to call it an F1.
[08:00.560 --> 08:06.540]  To make an F2, you would have to take a batch of those lemon jeffery F1 seeds or S1s.
[08:06.540 --> 08:08.180]  It's the same thing.
[08:08.180 --> 08:09.660]  Or R1 is what it technically is.
[08:09.660 --> 08:12.260]  It's an R1 and an F1 at the same time.
[08:12.260 --> 08:15.020]  You have to take seeds out of that batch.
[08:15.020 --> 08:20.060]  You're going to have to reverse that and then make that again with the same male and female
[08:20.060 --> 08:23.900]  out of that batch because that's how you make the filial generation.
[08:23.900 --> 08:29.180]  If you go back and use one of the males or females from previous, notice I said go back.
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.860]  That is a back cross.
[08:30.860 --> 08:35.380]  If they came from the same batch of seeds, if that's a ... This is a filial ... So when
[08:35.380 --> 08:38.300]  you make seeds, what comes out of there is the filial generation.
[08:38.300 --> 08:42.440]  If they are the same filial generation that you're crossing, then you move forward in
[08:42.440 --> 08:43.660]  filial generations.
[08:43.660 --> 08:48.820]  If you cross to anything else, you are making a new F1 or a back cross.
[08:48.820 --> 08:51.540]  I think that will sum up that part of the question.
[08:51.540 --> 08:56.980]  If you make seeds, take ... If you only cross one plant to another plant and then you get
[08:56.980 --> 09:00.860]  those seeds and you find a male and a female out of those or a female that you reverse
[09:00.860 --> 09:05.740]  out of those and cross that again, that is a F2 because that's a filial generation moving
[09:05.740 --> 09:06.740]  forward.
[09:06.740 --> 09:11.340]  If you moved backwards using a previous parent or a previous mom, now you are going backwards
[09:11.340 --> 09:12.340]  to a back cross.
[09:12.340 --> 09:13.620]  I hope that makes it clear.
[09:13.620 --> 09:17.500]  Now, the chunk of this I want to focus on is something you really said at the beginning
[09:17.500 --> 09:19.340]  was a feminized plant.
[09:19.340 --> 09:22.540]  You said, can I do this with feminized seeds?
[09:22.540 --> 09:28.540]  There's a lot of myths, misconceptions, misunderstandings, rumors, falsities, bullshit.
[09:28.540 --> 09:29.540]  What is it?
[09:29.540 --> 09:32.660]  Wackness, fuckery around feminized seeds.
[09:32.660 --> 09:36.740]  It's a lot of rumors and shit that people simply do not understand around feminized
[09:36.740 --> 09:37.740]  seeds.
[09:37.740 --> 09:38.740]  That is understandable.
[09:38.740 --> 09:42.500]  If you only learn from the internet, if you only learn from what your cousin's uncles
[09:42.500 --> 09:48.300]  told you that he heard from his brother in Vietnam that they met at a boot camp one time,
[09:48.300 --> 09:51.740]  that info is old and who knows what the fuck that person really said.
[09:51.740 --> 09:54.480]  Somebody heard one thing because we only half pay attention when we fucking listen to each
[09:54.480 --> 09:56.380]  other anyway.
[09:56.380 --> 10:01.700]  A lot of people have misinformation, misconceptions, bad info about fem seeds.
[10:01.700 --> 10:07.540]  Feminized seeds are no different than a regular seed other than the fact that the pollen,
[10:07.540 --> 10:08.740]  the pollen is the difference.
[10:08.740 --> 10:11.740]  The pollen was the part that was feminized.
[10:11.740 --> 10:17.020]  The plants are the same exact thing as a male female plant, except you won't find that male
[10:17.020 --> 10:20.780]  chromosome which would have been transferred in the pollen.
[10:20.780 --> 10:23.820]  I'm going to borrow a lesson from my friend, Mr. Soul.
[10:23.820 --> 10:25.980]  Big shout out to Mr. Soul.
[10:25.980 --> 10:30.540]  Mr. Soul and his amazing dude puts out some great seeds, puts out the Cindy 99 and some
[10:30.540 --> 10:31.540]  other great shit.
[10:31.540 --> 10:33.820]  Big shout out to Brothers Grimm Seed Company.
[10:33.820 --> 10:37.780]  Mr. Soul made the greatest analogy that I can ever think of.
[10:37.780 --> 10:41.780]  I can't come up with anything better than this, but I want to give him credit because
[10:41.780 --> 10:43.820]  give credit when credit is due.
[10:43.820 --> 10:46.740]  You've got to honor and credit your teachers, your masters.
[10:46.740 --> 10:52.580]  Something Mr. Soul taught us, the best way I can explain it, when we make feminized pollen,
[10:52.580 --> 10:54.260]  we are reversing a female plant.
[10:54.260 --> 10:58.300]  This is a full ... I'm going to go on a side tangent of my tangent.
[10:58.300 --> 11:00.020]  We're walking down alleys holding hands.
[11:00.020 --> 11:01.020]  Come with me.
[11:01.020 --> 11:02.020]  Let's do this together.
[11:02.020 --> 11:06.460]  A lot of people say that when we make fem seeds, we are using a treatment to make the
[11:06.460 --> 11:08.960]  female plant become a hermaphrodite.
[11:08.960 --> 11:09.960]  That is not true.
[11:09.960 --> 11:11.960]  That is not accurate.
[11:11.960 --> 11:15.140]  These plants are not intersex or hermaphroditic plants.
[11:15.140 --> 11:17.780]  If they were, I would not be making seeds with them.
[11:17.780 --> 11:21.140]  I stress test them and make sure they are not intersex plants.
[11:21.140 --> 11:26.080]  What I'm doing is not causing hermaphroditism or intersex.
[11:26.080 --> 11:27.940]  This is hermaphrodite, intersex.
[11:27.940 --> 11:29.100]  That is not the right word here.
[11:29.100 --> 11:30.100]  These plants are reversed.
[11:30.100 --> 11:33.180]  They are treated and reversed to make pollen.
[11:33.180 --> 11:34.860]  They are not male plants.
[11:34.860 --> 11:37.180]  They are female plants creating pollen.
[11:37.180 --> 11:38.180]  They're reversed.
[11:38.180 --> 11:39.180]  They're treated.
[11:39.180 --> 11:40.180]  They're not intersex.
[11:40.180 --> 11:41.180]  They're not hermaphrodites.
[11:41.180 --> 11:42.180]  Let's get that correct.
[11:42.180 --> 11:46.300]  Now, the part that Mr. Soul taught us, when we make feminized seeds, we are treating the
[11:46.300 --> 11:48.580]  female plant, a fully female plant.
[11:48.580 --> 11:51.380]  I touch on that again, fully female.
[11:51.380 --> 11:56.900]  We treat that with either silver thiosulfate or colloidal silver.
[11:56.900 --> 11:58.940]  I prefer the thiosulfate.
[11:58.940 --> 11:59.940]  I can't say it today.
[11:59.940 --> 12:01.940]  I fucking promise I know what it is.
[12:01.940 --> 12:05.420]  I prefer the silver thiosulfate method myself.
[12:05.420 --> 12:08.860]  If you do the other way or any other way, have fun.
[12:08.860 --> 12:09.860]  Power to the people.
[12:09.860 --> 12:11.580]  Do your fucking thing.
[12:11.580 --> 12:14.820]  We have learned how to make female plants produce pollen.
[12:14.940 --> 12:19.420]  Mr. Soul says, taught us that basically we have learned to put up a filter.
[12:19.420 --> 12:24.780]  Imagine your male plant, your pollen donor, or in this case, our reversed female plant
[12:24.780 --> 12:25.780]  is right here.
[12:25.780 --> 12:26.780]  It's over here.
[12:26.780 --> 12:27.780]  It's making pollen.
[12:27.780 --> 12:28.780]  It's jizzing.
[12:28.780 --> 12:29.780]  It's busting a load.
[12:29.780 --> 12:31.060]  It's doing its thing.
[12:31.060 --> 12:32.060]  You're going to sneeze.
[12:32.060 --> 12:33.260]  That's what it's doing.
[12:33.260 --> 12:35.060]  It's making you fucking sneeze.
[12:35.060 --> 12:37.260]  Over here, we've got female plants.
[12:37.260 --> 12:39.900]  They've got their hairs, like you guys like to call them.
[12:39.900 --> 12:40.900]  They're ready to go.
[12:40.900 --> 12:41.900]  They're ready to get pollinated.
[12:41.900 --> 12:43.300]  Their female parts are sticking up.
[12:43.300 --> 12:44.300]  These plants are horny.
[12:44.780 --> 12:47.300]  We've got dudes blowing loads or a reversed female blowing a load.
[12:47.300 --> 12:49.620]  We got ladies over here ready to get it.
[12:49.620 --> 12:54.300]  Somehow through the magic of science, basically what we have done by reversing these plants,
[12:54.300 --> 13:00.420]  Mr. Soul says, we put up a screen that works as a filter that only sucks out male pollen
[13:00.420 --> 13:03.060]  because the sex is determined through the pollen.
[13:03.060 --> 13:05.140]  That pollen is going to hit a female plant.
[13:05.140 --> 13:06.780]  Those chromosomes then are going to mix.
[13:06.780 --> 13:10.500]  If there's male chromosomes in there, that's when the plants will decide if it'll be a
[13:10.500 --> 13:11.700]  male or a female plant.
[13:11.700 --> 13:14.380]  We've already got the female pollen going over there.
[13:14.380 --> 13:15.620]  No male pollen.
[13:15.620 --> 13:19.860]  The only difference is we basically found a filter or a vacuum and we're sucking out
[13:19.860 --> 13:25.020]  the male pollen out of the sky before that male sperm ever lands on the plants.
[13:25.020 --> 13:28.180]  It's only female sperm, female pollen getting over there.
[13:28.180 --> 13:30.220]  We're only making female babies.
[13:30.220 --> 13:34.100]  That is not the scientific method, but that is the easiest way to explain it that most
[13:34.100 --> 13:35.660]  people will understand.
[13:35.660 --> 13:41.180]  Once again, credit to Mr. Soul for that explanation because that is the most reliable, teachable
[13:41.660 --> 13:42.660]  explanation I've ever heard.
[13:42.660 --> 13:46.500]  We have found a way to suck out the male pollen.
[13:46.500 --> 13:50.620]  The only big difference in these seeds in the offspring is that there will not be any
[13:50.620 --> 13:51.620]  males.
[13:51.620 --> 13:56.580]  Now, this is science and nature coming together and nature always has a way.
[13:56.580 --> 14:00.420]  I have seen full on male plants pop up from feminized projects.
[14:00.420 --> 14:02.060]  That is not impossible.
[14:02.060 --> 14:06.500]  It is highly unlikely and highly uncommon, but it does happen.
[14:06.500 --> 14:10.380]  That is just because this is nature and science and we cannot control everything.
[14:10.580 --> 14:12.420]  You guys have seen Jurassic Park.
[14:12.420 --> 14:13.940]  Life does find a way.
[14:13.940 --> 14:22.420]  Shit does happen, but if we do this correctly, we should come up with 99.9% pure female offspring.
[14:22.420 --> 14:27.340]  Now with that being said, there should not be any significant difference in the performance
[14:27.340 --> 14:30.420]  of a feminized or a regular seed.
[14:30.420 --> 14:32.340]  They should both germinate the same.
[14:32.340 --> 14:34.020]  They should veg at the same rate.
[14:34.020 --> 14:36.940]  Of course, you're going to have strain dependent variables.
[14:36.980 --> 14:40.660]  I've got some strains that simply veg slower than others and it doesn't matter if they
[14:40.660 --> 14:43.260]  came from a fem seed or a regular seed.
[14:43.260 --> 14:46.220]  That's just the vigor and growth of that specific plant.
[14:46.220 --> 14:51.540]  I truly do not think that regular or feminized has anything to do with it because sometimes
[14:51.540 --> 14:55.180]  the slower growing plants honestly can be those regular seeds.
[14:55.180 --> 14:56.820]  So they germinate the same.
[14:56.820 --> 14:58.040]  They veg the same.
[14:58.040 --> 14:59.300]  They flower the same.
[14:59.300 --> 15:02.860]  The potency will be the same.
[15:02.860 --> 15:04.580]  Here's something that I will say can be different.
[15:04.580 --> 15:06.900]  I found two variables as I'm thinking about this.
[15:06.900 --> 15:12.660]  I find less intersex plants in packs of feminized seeds than I do in regular seeds.
[15:12.660 --> 15:17.180]  Now since we've got feminized seeds dialed down and breeders are doing the work, I do
[15:17.180 --> 15:20.900]  find more problematic seeds in regular packs.
[15:20.900 --> 15:25.060]  So that is something I do notice that I will testify to as something who pops a lot of
[15:25.060 --> 15:27.700]  seeds, grows a lot of plants, works with a lot of seeds.
[15:27.700 --> 15:32.900]  I do see more anomalies, more variables, more freaks from the regular seeds.
[15:33.260 --> 15:41.260]  Another thing I can testify to is there is likely and commonly less variation in feminized
[15:41.260 --> 15:42.260]  seeds.
[15:42.260 --> 15:43.460]  Why is that?
[15:43.460 --> 15:47.780]  Because if we're making a selfed plant, if we're making let's say golden goat selfed
[15:47.780 --> 15:52.200]  seeds, a golden goat feminized plant, I cut a clone of golden goat, I cut another clone
[15:52.200 --> 15:54.700]  of golden goat, I treat one with our silver.
[15:54.700 --> 15:59.020]  If it's thiosulfate or colloidal silver, whichever, we treat one clone.
[15:59.020 --> 16:01.380]  We use that pollen to put on what?
[16:01.380 --> 16:02.380]  Golden goat.
[16:02.860 --> 16:04.860]  So all the genetics are in there.
[16:04.860 --> 16:06.860]  Golden goat, that's pure golden goat.
[16:06.860 --> 16:08.860]  You're not going to find anything but golden goat.
[16:08.860 --> 16:13.220]  You may see some grandparents, some parent traits of golden goat, but you're not going
[16:13.220 --> 16:15.020]  to find adulterated golden goat.
[16:15.020 --> 16:20.420]  The other option is golden goat BX, which of course you've got another plant in there,
[16:20.420 --> 16:25.180]  another line of genetics which adulterate that, which give you way more phenotypical
[16:25.180 --> 16:26.180]  options.
[16:26.180 --> 16:32.180]  So in my opinion, in my experience, in my testimony, I see and find less variation amongst
[16:32.180 --> 16:33.940]  feminized seeds.
[16:33.940 --> 16:35.700]  So that's a pro to the fem seeds.
[16:35.700 --> 16:39.180]  I was going to try to say that there's no difference and that they're even, but we have
[16:39.180 --> 16:41.000]  found a solid difference here.
[16:41.000 --> 16:46.700]  In the regular seeds, I do find more problems, more mutants, more weirdos, more intersex
[16:46.700 --> 16:47.700]  plants.
[16:47.700 --> 16:53.940]  In the fems, I see less variation, more reliability, which is what we are calling stability in
[16:53.940 --> 16:55.740]  the cannabis space.
[16:55.740 --> 16:57.220]  So let's elaborate on this a lot.
[16:57.220 --> 16:59.500]  Part of this question was about breeding with fems.
[16:59.500 --> 17:02.220]  I often get asked, can you breed with feminized seeds?
[17:02.220 --> 17:04.380]  Can you keep mothers of feminized seeds?
[17:04.380 --> 17:06.860]  And the answer to all of that is yes.
[17:06.860 --> 17:12.700]  They're just like a regular male, female plant, except you did not have to fuck with the male
[17:12.700 --> 17:14.980]  plants when you were doing the sexing.
[17:14.980 --> 17:20.260]  If the breeder did the work, that feminized seed will be everything the same.
[17:20.260 --> 17:21.260]  It'll have the vigor.
[17:21.260 --> 17:22.260]  I've said this before.
[17:22.260 --> 17:27.380]  It'll have all the traits, all the qualities, all of the abilities of a regular plant, except
[17:27.380 --> 17:30.780]  you don't have to worry about getting a male in that pack.
[17:30.780 --> 17:33.100]  Oftentimes there's no way to get a certain strain.
[17:33.100 --> 17:38.140]  Like real Gorilla Glue, people talk about they've got Gorilla Glue number four.
[17:38.140 --> 17:41.820]  The only way you've got, it was a clone only, unless you got the clone.
[17:41.820 --> 17:46.340]  If you bought seeds, they had to be feminized seeds because there was nothing put out.
[17:46.340 --> 17:48.300]  There were no seeds put out of the Gorilla Glue.
[17:48.300 --> 17:51.820]  So if you wanted seeds of it, you had to get feminized seeds.
[17:52.380 --> 17:56.340]  It had to be the Gorilla Glue, cut a clone, cut another clone, reverse it, put it on the
[17:56.340 --> 17:58.860]  Gorilla Glue, make feminized self seeds.
[17:58.860 --> 18:00.540]  That was the only way to get it.
[18:00.540 --> 18:04.620]  Otherwise you had to adulterate it and cross it to whatever I was working with.
[18:04.620 --> 18:05.620]  Was it King Solomon?
[18:05.620 --> 18:06.620]  Maybe I did that.
[18:06.620 --> 18:08.460]  Maybe I hit the Gorilla Glue with Solomon.
[18:08.460 --> 18:12.060]  Maybe I've got something in the works right now with a feminized Gorilla Glue project
[18:12.060 --> 18:14.620]  coming up that I don't want to talk about yet.
[18:14.620 --> 18:19.340]  But the reason that we do a lot of fem stuff is because it is simply not available in the
[18:19.340 --> 18:20.540]  regular form.
[18:21.340 --> 18:24.460]  Really, we don't want to put out misrepresentations of our lines out there.
[18:24.460 --> 18:29.740]  I put out Golden Goat Fem seeds and I don't want to ruin the reputation of Golden Goat
[18:29.740 --> 18:31.220]  by putting out bullshit.
[18:31.220 --> 18:35.100]  So I did work hard at making sure that those seeds were correct.
[18:35.100 --> 18:37.980]  So I got on a big ramble there.
[18:37.980 --> 18:39.660]  I think there are less...
[18:39.660 --> 18:40.660]  You can use...
[18:40.660 --> 18:41.660]  Here I am.
[18:41.660 --> 18:42.660]  I'm back on track.
[18:42.660 --> 18:46.900]  You can use feminized seeds for anything that you can use a regular male, female seed for.
[18:46.900 --> 18:48.380]  You can make a mom out of it.
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.780]  You can cut clones with it.
[18:49.780 --> 18:51.060]  You can breed to it.
[18:51.060 --> 18:56.300]  You can do anything and it will work beautifully if you have done your selection properly.
[18:56.300 --> 18:59.540]  Also that goes back to if the breeder did their work properly.
[18:59.540 --> 19:04.100]  Did they select female plants that did not show any intersex traits?
[19:04.100 --> 19:09.380]  Did they select plants that handle stress well, handle bugs well, possibly pathogens
[19:09.380 --> 19:11.140]  well, abuse well?
[19:11.140 --> 19:16.260]  I really try when I'm making fem seeds that are going to market, I try to find plants
[19:16.260 --> 19:17.820]  that you can beat the shit out of.
[19:17.860 --> 19:22.700]  I want my clientele to be able to have a product that they can beat up.
[19:22.700 --> 19:24.300]  I want to set them up for success.
[19:24.300 --> 19:29.020]  So I find plants that can take abuse, can handle pests, pathogens, problems.
[19:29.020 --> 19:30.260]  That's really what I'm looking for.
[19:30.260 --> 19:31.900]  So did the breeder do the work?
[19:31.900 --> 19:33.340]  Did they stress test their plants?
[19:33.340 --> 19:34.740]  Did they sex test them?
[19:34.740 --> 19:38.980]  Did they intersex test them and put them through the ringer before they bred to them?
[19:38.980 --> 19:41.620]  So if they did all that part, then you did your proper selection.
[19:41.620 --> 19:46.220]  If you selected your females and you ran them through a few stress tests a couple of times,
[19:46.220 --> 19:47.740]  did the proper pheno hunt.
[19:47.780 --> 19:51.540]  And if you're going to breed with them, they will work just like any other seeds.
[19:51.540 --> 19:52.820]  I made Lemon Jeffrey.
[19:52.820 --> 19:54.260]  Let's talk again about Lemon Jeffrey.
[19:54.260 --> 19:57.500]  That is a, it's a lemon skunk plant from greenhouse seeds.
[19:57.500 --> 19:59.700]  I got it in a pack of seeds as a gift.
[19:59.700 --> 20:01.620]  It is a champion lemon skunk.
[20:01.620 --> 20:02.620]  I came from seeds.
[20:02.620 --> 20:04.140]  So nobody's got the one that I've got.
[20:04.140 --> 20:05.980]  That's one of the best parts about growing from seed.
[20:05.980 --> 20:08.540]  I've got this phenotype that you don't have.
[20:08.540 --> 20:09.900]  So I've got the lemon skunk.
[20:09.900 --> 20:11.700]  I reversed golden goat.
[20:11.700 --> 20:15.020]  I put that reversed golden goat pollen onto the lemon skunk.
[20:15.020 --> 20:17.060]  We now made Lemon Jeffrey.
[20:17.100 --> 20:19.860]  I have got the prized keeper of Lemon Jeffrey.
[20:19.860 --> 20:21.300]  I've got the champion.
[20:21.300 --> 20:22.340]  It's amazing.
[20:22.340 --> 20:25.180]  This cut of Lemon Jeffrey does everything you would want it to do.
[20:25.180 --> 20:26.380]  It tastes amazing.
[20:26.380 --> 20:27.700]  It hits in potency.
[20:27.700 --> 20:28.740]  It hits in weight.
[20:28.740 --> 20:29.940]  It grows quickly.
[20:29.940 --> 20:31.580]  It's a perfect fucking plant.
[20:31.580 --> 20:34.460]  So I took that plant and I pollinated it.
[20:34.460 --> 20:35.820]  What did I pollinate it with?
[20:35.820 --> 20:37.500]  I've hit it with the grateful dog.
[20:37.500 --> 20:40.620]  I've also hit it with, oh, the grateful dog is also feminized.
[20:40.620 --> 20:41.460]  What?
[20:41.460 --> 20:42.660]  That's a great thing to talk about.
[20:42.660 --> 20:44.380]  Grateful dog is feminized.
[20:44.380 --> 20:45.980]  Lemon Jeffrey is feminized.
[20:45.980 --> 20:48.420]  I have reversed the grateful dog
[20:48.420 --> 20:51.540]  and put that pollen on the feminized Lemon Jeffrey.
[20:51.540 --> 20:55.020]  And that makes amazing, what, feminized offspring.
[20:55.020 --> 20:55.860]  What?
[20:55.860 --> 20:57.580]  Yeah, I've never released those to many people.
[20:57.580 --> 20:58.500]  I put out some testers
[20:58.500 --> 21:00.940]  and then my social media accounts got squashed
[21:00.940 --> 21:01.820]  right as I put those out
[21:01.820 --> 21:03.500]  and I lost contact with all those testers.
[21:03.500 --> 21:05.100]  And I've only got a few seeds left.
[21:05.100 --> 21:07.460]  I can make more, but that's not what I'm gonna do right now.
[21:07.460 --> 21:09.660]  Also with that, what else have we made?
[21:09.660 --> 21:11.180]  We have made Lemon Sunrise.
[21:11.180 --> 21:13.660]  That's Lemon Jeffrey to the arise.
[21:13.660 --> 21:15.420]  That's a regular King Solomon,
[21:15.420 --> 21:17.620]  regular male to a feminized plant
[21:17.620 --> 21:19.020]  that makes amazing offspring.
[21:19.020 --> 21:21.740]  So yes, I do keep a Lemon Jeffrey mother plant.
[21:21.740 --> 21:22.980]  It's been around for a long time.
[21:22.980 --> 21:25.540]  The grateful dog is a feminized mother plant,
[21:25.540 --> 21:27.460]  which has been around for a long time,
[21:27.460 --> 21:30.360]  which has been bred to regular and feminized stuff.
[21:30.360 --> 21:32.140]  So I've done it both ways, you guys.
[21:32.140 --> 21:36.100]  I've done regular male plants to feminized females
[21:36.100 --> 21:40.560]  and I've done reversed females to regular females,
[21:40.560 --> 21:41.480]  which sounds weird.
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.380]  I've done everything you can think about doing,
[21:44.100 --> 21:47.220]  reverse to regular, regular to reverse, reverse to reverse.
[21:47.220 --> 21:48.940]  I've done it all and they all work
[21:48.940 --> 21:51.480]  because they are plants and that feminized factor
[21:51.480 --> 21:54.780]  only makes a difference when it comes to making the seeds
[21:54.780 --> 21:57.580]  and ensuring that the consumer, the customer,
[21:57.580 --> 22:02.540]  the clientele, the grower ends up with a feminized seed,
[22:02.540 --> 22:03.860]  a feminized plant.
[22:03.860 --> 22:04.960]  All right, I've been rambling.
[22:04.960 --> 22:06.860]  I think I've covered my notes here.
[22:06.860 --> 22:08.420]  I think I covered all the bullet points
[22:08.420 --> 22:09.700]  I wanted to touch on.
[22:09.700 --> 22:11.340]  I don't know how long this episode was.
[22:11.340 --> 22:12.500]  I feel like I was going fast.
[22:12.500 --> 22:15.020]  It feels kind of quick, but once again,
[22:15.020 --> 22:16.740]  I don't need to ramble and make this too long.
[22:16.740 --> 22:18.360]  It would just get worse from here.
[22:18.360 --> 22:20.460]  So let's start wrapping it up.
[22:20.460 --> 22:22.380]  Ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes,
[22:22.380 --> 22:24.640]  friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
[22:24.640 --> 22:26.420]  pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful
[22:26.420 --> 22:27.940]  cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[22:27.940 --> 22:29.460]  I do thank you once again for listening
[22:29.460 --> 22:30.860]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[22:30.860 --> 22:35.060]  Also thank you for a great Patreon month in January.
[22:35.060 --> 22:38.260]  We did hit records, high numbers of patrons
[22:38.260 --> 22:39.900]  and high numbers of contributions.
[22:39.900 --> 22:41.220]  I do appreciate that.
[22:41.220 --> 22:42.060]  Big thanks.
[22:42.580 --> 22:44.620]  I'm going to offer more discounts and coupon codes,
[22:44.620 --> 22:46.300]  try to find more ways to make it up for you.
[22:46.300 --> 22:48.220]  I'm working on new merch.
[22:48.220 --> 22:49.740]  I've talked about this already.
[22:49.740 --> 22:52.800]  Stay tuned because episode 719 is coming.
[22:52.800 --> 22:54.780]  That may not be significant to you.
[22:54.780 --> 22:56.920]  My area code is 719.
[22:56.920 --> 22:59.340]  We're going to focus on my city,
[22:59.340 --> 23:02.020]  the way that cannabis legalization helped my city.
[23:02.020 --> 23:05.200]  I'm doing my best to get Mike on that show.
[23:05.200 --> 23:06.620]  Mike, if you are listening,
[23:06.620 --> 23:08.260]  I'm going to order another microphone
[23:08.260 --> 23:10.460]  and some more equipment to have you right here
[23:10.460 --> 23:13.260]  at this side of the table to make it a group show.
[23:13.260 --> 23:14.540]  We'll do two guys on the show.
[23:14.540 --> 23:16.540]  It's been a long time since I've had anybody on the show,
[23:16.540 --> 23:19.180]  since this whole, the pandemic has happened.
[23:19.180 --> 23:21.940]  So Mike, get prepared, get some notes, buddy.
[23:21.940 --> 23:23.420]  We're going to let Mike talk about numbers
[23:23.420 --> 23:25.500]  because Mike's the numbers guy.
[23:25.500 --> 23:27.360]  Talk about growth and stuff here in Pueblo
[23:27.360 --> 23:30.980]  because of the legalization of recreational cannabis.
[23:30.980 --> 23:32.660]  Mike will be here for that.
[23:32.660 --> 23:34.240]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments,
[23:34.240 --> 23:35.860]  or concerns, you know I would love to hear from you.
[23:35.860 --> 23:38.920]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:38.920 --> 23:41.320]  Also, don't forget about the Grow Help tab.
[23:41.320 --> 23:42.640]  I talked about that at the start of the show.
[23:42.640 --> 23:45.220]  Go to the website, iereadgenetics.com,
[23:45.220 --> 23:47.180]  find the Grow Help tab, send me your questions.
[23:47.180 --> 23:48.720]  There's a lot of great shit on there.
[23:48.720 --> 23:49.720]  There's a Grow Help tab.
[23:49.720 --> 23:51.120]  There is a link to the Discord.
[23:51.120 --> 23:53.680]  If you're not on the Discord, you're missing out.
[23:53.680 --> 23:56.400]  Join the Discord, lots of great shit happening over there.
[23:56.400 --> 23:58.380]  I hung out on the Discord group chat last night
[23:58.380 --> 24:00.500]  for probably two and a half hours,
[24:00.500 --> 24:01.400]  took a bunch of dabs,
[24:01.400 --> 24:03.520]  talked a bunch of shit with the crew, good time.
[24:03.520 --> 24:05.160]  Shout out to all my friends on Discord.
[24:05.160 --> 24:07.460]  Love you guys, always a good time hanging out with you.
[24:07.500 --> 24:08.980]  Also, there's a link to the merch.
[24:08.980 --> 24:10.400]  There's a lot of great merchandise
[24:10.400 --> 24:14.200]  on the iereadgenetics merch page.
[24:14.200 --> 24:15.560]  Everything else, check out the website.
[24:15.560 --> 24:18.860]  Don't forget patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[24:18.860 --> 24:20.800]  My voice is burning out, I'm getting thirsty,
[24:20.800 --> 24:24.060]  and I want a dab, so it is time to wrap up this show.
[24:24.060 --> 24:27.100]  I wanna give a big shout out to my buddy, Shiz Khalifa.
[24:27.100 --> 24:29.380]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[24:29.380 --> 24:30.940]  and give your mom a hug for me.
