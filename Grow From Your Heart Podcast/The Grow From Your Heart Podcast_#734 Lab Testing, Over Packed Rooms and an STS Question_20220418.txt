[00:05.950 --> 00:25.880]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:25.880 --> 00:28.460]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:28.460 --> 00:33.920]  This is episode 734 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:33.920 --> 00:37.080]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of listener emails.
[00:37.080 --> 00:40.440]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:40.440 --> 00:44.640]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:44.640 --> 00:47.280]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:47.280 --> 00:48.280]  Thank you.
[00:48.280 --> 00:50.200]  Shout out to my friend, Rasta Green Thumb.
[00:50.200 --> 00:53.680]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy Curbside Gardens.
[00:53.680 --> 00:57.640]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Captain Mojo and Made While Medicated.
[00:57.640 --> 01:00.820]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Mr. Mean Green.
[01:00.820 --> 01:04.240]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Jessica Kay and Lots of Tricombs.
[01:04.240 --> 01:07.560]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy Dot Grows.
[01:07.560 --> 01:10.520]  Let's send a thank you shout out to B Bala and Glen Jaroni.
[01:10.520 --> 01:13.240]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Frogman 420.
[01:13.240 --> 01:15.560]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Froggle Rock.
[01:15.560 --> 01:18.960]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:18.960 --> 01:19.960]  Thank you.
[01:19.960 --> 01:21.880]  Shout out to the Dad Haze.
[01:21.880 --> 01:26.760]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:26.760 --> 01:30.440]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:30.440 --> 01:36.640]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:36.640 --> 01:39.100]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:39.100 --> 01:43.500]  And you know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make
[01:43.500 --> 01:49.660]  it super easy for all of my friends to support the show on Patreon.
[01:49.660 --> 01:54.760]  Before I get too far, I do want to apologize that sometimes I've noticed the episodes are
[01:54.760 --> 02:01.420]  not loading on Spotify, Stitcher Radio, Apple Podcasts in a timely appropriate manner.
[02:01.420 --> 02:04.020]  I do schedule those episodes to pop up.
[02:04.020 --> 02:05.020]  It is, what is it?
[02:05.020 --> 02:07.780]  Midnight when it shifts from Sunday night to Monday morning.
[02:07.780 --> 02:09.060]  I guess that's midnight Monday.
[02:09.060 --> 02:10.580]  I'm not sure if that's midnight Sunday.
[02:10.580 --> 02:12.100]  Anyway, you know what I'm talking about.
[02:12.100 --> 02:15.740]  The shift in mountain time from Sunday to Monday at 12 o'clock, that's when the show
[02:15.740 --> 02:16.740]  should post.
[02:16.740 --> 02:19.980]  Also, Wednesday to Thursday, that transition, it should post.
[02:19.980 --> 02:22.060]  However, some of the servers are late.
[02:22.060 --> 02:23.060]  Some of them are behind.
[02:23.060 --> 02:26.140]  I don't completely understand the technology that makes it happen.
[02:26.140 --> 02:30.740]  But I know that I post my file, my show to an RSS feed.
[02:30.740 --> 02:33.400]  Every so often, those servers do what is known as a crawl.
[02:33.400 --> 02:36.700]  They make sure that they've got all the RSS feeds caught up.
[02:36.700 --> 02:37.700]  They go through and they do an update.
[02:37.700 --> 02:39.860]  It's like, do I have any messages is basically what they do.
[02:39.860 --> 02:43.020]  They scroll through and they say, hey, Ross and Jeff posted some new shit.
[02:43.020 --> 02:44.340]  We'll put that out to the feed.
[02:44.340 --> 02:45.780]  They post it up to their stuff.
[02:45.780 --> 02:48.000]  Then you guys were able to access it.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.780]  Sometimes it happens instantly.
[02:49.780 --> 02:51.860]  Sometimes it takes hours for it to happen.
[02:51.860 --> 02:55.500]  There are servers that I can't even get to update at this point in time.
[02:55.500 --> 02:59.060]  A lot of people tell me that my show is not working on Google Podcasts.
[02:59.060 --> 03:00.060]  I've emailed them.
[03:00.060 --> 03:01.060]  I've updated the server.
[03:01.060 --> 03:03.060]  I've done everything I know how to do.
[03:03.060 --> 03:04.140]  That shit isn't going to work.
[03:04.140 --> 03:05.660]  I don't know what to do next.
[03:05.660 --> 03:07.660]  The customer service is basically tired of me.
[03:07.660 --> 03:08.900]  They have quit responding.
[03:08.900 --> 03:09.900]  I might be stuck.
[03:09.900 --> 03:13.860]  One day I may get inspired to start over there, but so far, Google Podcasts has been shit
[03:13.860 --> 03:14.860]  out of luck.
[03:14.860 --> 03:18.940]  I noticed that recently, Stitcher Radio has stopped updating my show completely.
[03:18.940 --> 03:20.460]  I've messaged customer service there.
[03:20.460 --> 03:22.220]  They have not given me a resolution.
[03:22.220 --> 03:26.860]  My point here is I do know now that the episodes, that the shows are messing up on some servers.
[03:26.860 --> 03:32.100]  However, I did not know until a few polite listeners messaged me.
[03:32.100 --> 03:36.180]  If I'm missing shows, if the episodes are not popping up where they should be, when
[03:36.180 --> 03:38.220]  they should be, maybe I don't know.
[03:38.220 --> 03:41.900]  I don't watch my show on every platform as often as I should.
[03:41.900 --> 03:43.700]  I don't check as much as I should maybe.
[03:43.700 --> 03:46.500]  I rely on the audience to let me know when things go wrong.
[03:46.500 --> 03:48.300]  A lot of times you do.
[03:48.300 --> 03:49.300]  Sometimes you do not.
[03:49.300 --> 03:50.300]  I do encourage you.
[03:50.300 --> 03:53.500]  You might not even hear this because you're waiting for an episode to update somewhere
[03:53.500 --> 03:55.660]  and you don't even know that this is coming out.
[03:55.660 --> 03:57.140]  This could be completely redundant.
[03:57.140 --> 03:59.820]  However, if I do miss an episode, you're wondering where it went.
[03:59.820 --> 04:00.820]  I put it out.
[04:00.820 --> 04:03.140]  The server just did not grab it on time.
[04:03.140 --> 04:06.140]  If you're listening to this, which you feel is way late, I apologize.
[04:06.140 --> 04:07.140]  I'm trying.
[04:07.140 --> 04:08.140]  I put the episodes out.
[04:08.140 --> 04:12.420]  Like I said, I try to have them ready for you Sunday and Wednesday so they are prepared.
[04:12.420 --> 04:13.860]  Sometimes those crawls don't happen.
[04:13.860 --> 04:14.860]  Sometimes they don't grab.
[04:14.860 --> 04:16.300]  Again, I apologize.
[04:16.300 --> 04:18.700]  Bottom line here, let me know because I'm putting this shit out.
[04:18.700 --> 04:21.700]  I want to make sure it gets to your ears.
[04:21.700 --> 04:22.860]  Where do we go from there?
[04:22.860 --> 04:24.380]  The merchandise sale.
[04:24.380 --> 04:28.220]  In the month of April, I'm doing a huge sale on all of the merchandise on my website.
[04:28.220 --> 04:31.900]  That is the shirts, hats, stickers, rolling trays, grinders.
[04:31.900 --> 04:34.940]  A few things are selling out so grab them quickly.
[04:34.940 --> 04:37.460]  Thank you to everybody who has supported the merchandise sale.
[04:37.460 --> 04:39.980]  The sale has been amazing.
[04:39.980 --> 04:43.300]  I did do a coupon code for everybody that joins the newsletter.
[04:43.300 --> 04:48.340]  I did a coupon code for everybody on Discord and I did a tiered level of coupon codes for
[04:48.340 --> 04:49.660]  everybody on Patreon.
[04:49.660 --> 04:51.700]  The lower levels got a smaller coupon.
[04:51.700 --> 04:54.300]  The higher levels up, they got bigger coupon codes.
[04:54.300 --> 04:56.740]  The mod team on Patreon got really hooked up.
[04:56.740 --> 05:01.820]  Thank you guys for all of the Patreon and Discord and what is it, merchandise support.
[05:01.820 --> 05:03.060]  That's what I'm trying to say.
[05:03.060 --> 05:04.580]  Thank you for the support on the merch sale.
[05:04.580 --> 05:08.940]  I've been trying to clean out some boxes, make some space so that I can order more stuff.
[05:08.940 --> 05:12.660]  Having boxes with like three and four t-shirts in it, taking up a space is annoying.
[05:12.660 --> 05:14.660]  We're going to replenish and refresh.
[05:14.660 --> 05:18.520]  If you've been looking for sizes, if you've got new ideas, stay tuned.
[05:18.520 --> 05:20.500]  New merch is coming soon.
[05:20.500 --> 05:23.900]  It is kind of a one man show so I'm a little bit overloaded with stuff like that.
[05:23.900 --> 05:25.320]  I've got a lot of great merch ideas.
[05:25.320 --> 05:27.840]  If you have more ideas, send them to me.
[05:27.840 --> 05:28.840]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com.
[05:28.840 --> 05:30.200]  I love merch ideas.
[05:30.200 --> 05:32.680]  Shout out to everybody who sent me the great ideas.
[05:32.680 --> 05:34.540]  I will get them rolling.
[05:34.540 --> 05:35.540]  It is coming.
[05:35.540 --> 05:36.540]  It's just me.
[05:36.540 --> 05:40.760]  I try to stay more focused on making seeds, doing podcasts and stuff like that.
[05:40.760 --> 05:42.100]  Anyway, let's move forward.
[05:42.100 --> 05:45.960]  Thank you guys for all of the merchandise sales and support.
[05:45.960 --> 05:47.480]  I do appreciate that.
[05:47.480 --> 05:52.000]  The next thing I do need to give a big shout out to is the secret Discord.
[05:52.000 --> 06:19.480]  What is a private grower to do when all of the testing labs on Google require strict
[06:20.480 --> 06:22.920]  laws, grower IDs and such?
[06:22.920 --> 06:27.680]  Are there any labs you're aware of that accept private samples for testing?
[06:27.680 --> 06:32.720]  Unfortunately, in the state of Colorado right now, we are not allowed to have our personal
[06:32.720 --> 06:36.040]  private grows tested to the best of my knowledge.
[06:36.040 --> 06:41.900]  All of the testing facilities have to be regulated by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[06:41.900 --> 06:43.140]  There is a reason for that.
[06:43.140 --> 06:47.800]  A lot of people don't like the rules and reasons and regulations, but let me explain why this
[06:47.800 --> 06:50.020]  rule is in place.
[06:50.020 --> 06:55.160]  For a facility to possess the amount of cannabis which may be delivered to a testing facility
[06:55.160 --> 07:00.740]  at any one given time, they would go over their legal limits in the state of Colorado
[07:00.740 --> 07:05.000]  without some sort of special licensing, without some sort of possession limit.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.320]  So if we all just took, it may be take one gram, maybe two grams of your batch.
[07:09.320 --> 07:13.880]  If we all took two grams or a gram to this testing lab, they're going to have at least
[07:13.880 --> 07:19.260]  ounces, probably pounds, maybe multiple pounds of product on site at one time, which does
[07:19.260 --> 07:23.880]  make them over the limit for their regular possession of cannabis in Colorado.
[07:23.880 --> 07:26.120]  We're allowed to have two ounces in our possession.
[07:26.120 --> 07:28.680]  28 grams times two is 56 grams.
[07:28.680 --> 07:31.640]  That's going to put them over their limit really quickly if they get good clientele,
[07:31.640 --> 07:32.640]  good customers.
[07:32.640 --> 07:34.240]  They can't have anything in storage.
[07:34.240 --> 07:37.080]  They can't have a backlog, so you can't bring it in, give it to them.
[07:37.080 --> 07:38.080]  They can't test it.
[07:38.080 --> 07:41.600]  Also, there's no legal transfer opportunity there.
[07:41.600 --> 07:46.360]  They have to have a way to receive the product from the person giving it to them.
[07:46.360 --> 07:47.480]  Then they have to receive it away.
[07:47.480 --> 07:48.480]  It's got to be documented.
[07:48.480 --> 07:54.440]  So to avoid any sort of weird legal complications, illegal transfer, illegal possession, they
[07:54.440 --> 07:59.040]  did decide to regulate those facilities by the Marijuana Enforcement Division, which
[07:59.040 --> 08:03.200]  means only facilities which are regulated by the Marijuana Enforcement Division are
[08:03.200 --> 08:05.320]  allowed to use those facilities.
[08:05.320 --> 08:09.920]  So the commercial grows are the only ones that can use those here in the state of Colorado.
[08:09.920 --> 08:13.800]  To the best of my knowledge, there may be little private pop-up shops that are doing
[08:13.800 --> 08:14.800]  it.
[08:14.800 --> 08:16.120]  They are not advertising heavily.
[08:16.120 --> 08:20.280]  I don't know where they are, wink, wink, but they may be secretly available.
[08:20.280 --> 08:21.680]  That is the state of Colorado.
[08:21.680 --> 08:27.680]  In newer states, I'm not exactly sure the way that testing is working there.
[08:27.680 --> 08:31.580]  One thing, I do have two recommendations that I can recommend for you.
[08:31.580 --> 08:34.880]  One is they are now offering at-home testing devices.
[08:34.880 --> 08:37.180]  I do not work for any of those companies.
[08:37.180 --> 08:39.640]  There's one company that's named after a color.
[08:39.640 --> 08:45.920]  If you would like to send me a sample of your THC testing device, I would love to play
[08:45.920 --> 08:46.920]  with that.
[08:46.920 --> 08:47.920]  I would do a solid review on the show.
[08:47.920 --> 08:52.700]  If you want me to buy it for a half price or an advertising price, let's reach out and
[08:52.700 --> 08:53.700]  talk to each other.
[08:53.700 --> 08:57.680]  It's a little expensive for a toy that I wouldn't use very much, but if they sent it to me,
[08:57.680 --> 09:00.680]  I would definitely talk about it on the show, advertise the shit out of it.
[09:00.680 --> 09:05.120]  It is named after a color, and it is a testing device that will test your THC content at
[09:05.120 --> 09:06.240]  home.
[09:06.240 --> 09:10.120]  I have a couple of friends who say it is a very reliable device.
[09:10.120 --> 09:11.760]  Now, here's what you can do with it.
[09:11.760 --> 09:16.280]  I wouldn't rely on it to be as reliable as a lab, and I'm going to talk more.
[09:16.280 --> 09:17.280]  Let's talk about that right now.
[09:17.280 --> 09:19.720]  The labs aren't 100% reliable, in my opinion.
[09:19.720 --> 09:22.080]  Anyway, I know how to skew a lab test.
[09:22.080 --> 09:26.440]  I've sent two samples to a lab and have had two totally different tests.
[09:26.440 --> 09:30.080]  I've had the same sample sent to two labs and had totally different tests.
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.680]  The lab testing is not 100% accurate at this time yet anyway, so the at-home lab testing
[09:35.680 --> 09:36.920]  may be just as good.
[09:36.920 --> 09:38.440]  You can pay one price for this device.
[09:38.440 --> 09:43.080]  I do believe it's about $1,500, but once you've got it, you can test all your products.
[09:43.080 --> 09:47.720]  The testing gets expensive if you test a lot anyway, so you can get this one tester at
[09:47.720 --> 09:49.240]  home and test with that.
[09:49.240 --> 09:53.820]  It may not be 100% accurate is where I was headed, but it will give you a range.
[09:53.820 --> 09:58.280]  If you were a breeder and you were phenohunting, or if you're a grower that is phenohunting,
[09:58.280 --> 10:02.120]  you're trying to find that phenotype that produces the most THC, you'll still know which
[10:02.120 --> 10:04.000]  one produced the most.
[10:04.000 --> 10:07.160]  One will say 17, one will say 18, one will say 19.
[10:07.160 --> 10:12.240]  If that machine isn't 100% accurate, we still know which one is low, medium, and highest.
[10:12.240 --> 10:16.920]  That will be a good place to start and then test a bunch of products with that, then send
[10:16.920 --> 10:21.720]  those same products to labs and see how close that testing comes back, compare them.
[10:21.720 --> 10:27.960]  Once again, if you run a THC testing company that makes an at-home product, let's talk
[10:27.960 --> 10:30.040]  because I would love to have one of those on the show.
[10:30.040 --> 10:31.120]  I'd love to play with that.
[10:31.120 --> 10:35.000]  I'm talking to you if your company is the name of a color.
[10:35.000 --> 10:38.520]  The at-home testing in Colorado, the first thing I would recommend is get yourself an
[10:38.520 --> 10:39.760]  at-home testing device.
[10:39.760 --> 10:42.200]  The one named after a color is the one I recommend.
[10:42.200 --> 10:43.200]  Nobody pays me to say that.
[10:43.200 --> 10:44.280]  I've got friends that have used it.
[10:44.280 --> 10:45.800]  They say it's a great product.
[10:45.800 --> 10:51.080]  The next way that you could do this in Colorado, allegedly, I've heard of people doing this.
[10:51.080 --> 10:52.200]  I can't tell you to do this.
[10:52.200 --> 10:53.560]  I can't recommend that you do this.
[10:53.560 --> 10:55.240]  I may get in trouble for that.
[10:55.240 --> 11:01.200]  I'm going to say what I know people to have done in the past is to find a CBD testing
[11:01.200 --> 11:02.200]  laboratory.
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.960]  In the state of Colorado, if you want to grow hemp or CBD plants, those plants cannot test
[11:06.960 --> 11:09.280]  within a threshold of cannabis over 0.3%.
[11:09.280 --> 11:12.240]  Is it 0.3% or 3%?
[11:12.240 --> 11:13.240]  Doesn't matter.
[11:13.240 --> 11:15.560]  There's a low number of THC those plants can have in them.
[11:15.560 --> 11:18.880]  If they have higher than that, they're not allowed to be sold as hemp plants.
[11:18.880 --> 11:19.880]  They're no longer CBD.
[11:19.880 --> 11:21.440]  They're THC plants.
[11:21.440 --> 11:23.040]  Your crop is what we call hot.
[11:23.040 --> 11:27.120]  It's got to be destroyed or it's got to be mitigated in some ways where that THC doesn't
[11:27.120 --> 11:29.040]  make it to your clients.
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.040]  A lot of those brands, a lot of those farms are required to test their product.
[11:33.040 --> 11:37.400]  They have a testing lab set up where a lot of people take their hemp and get it tested.
[11:37.400 --> 11:41.360]  Maybe possibly I've heard of people taking their homegrown cannabis there that they knew
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.520]  was going to be super high testing in THC and zero CBD.
[11:45.520 --> 11:48.000]  You just turn it in and you say, here's my hemp sample.
[11:48.000 --> 11:49.000]  Can you give me a report?
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.040]  They call you back and they go, they don't really say this, but they kind of say this.
[11:52.040 --> 11:57.240]  They go, you motherfucker, you knew this was going to be 32% THC and zero CBD.
[11:57.240 --> 11:59.360]  This is not qualifying as CBD as hemp.
[11:59.360 --> 12:00.360]  What are you going to do?
[12:00.360 --> 12:01.720]  And they go, oh, thank you for the lab report.
[12:01.720 --> 12:02.720]  Thank you a lot.
[12:02.720 --> 12:05.600]  And they pay it and they have a fucking THC report that says 32%.
[12:05.600 --> 12:09.720]  That is a shady, shifty way to do it, but it's all too common here in Colorado because
[12:09.720 --> 12:11.660]  that is what we've got to do.
[12:11.660 --> 12:16.440]  If a home grower does want to get their product tested in a reliable, safe, effective way
[12:16.440 --> 12:19.320]  and not buy a home testing device.
[12:19.320 --> 12:20.520]  All right.
[12:20.520 --> 12:23.360]  I think I wrapped that one up.
[12:23.360 --> 12:25.600]  With all the strict adherence to laws, yeah.
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.440]  You're going to have to either find a lab testing place that will test a home grower
[12:29.440 --> 12:34.420]  stuff, buy yourself a home testing device or be shady and send it through a hemp testing
[12:34.420 --> 12:35.420]  facility.
[12:35.420 --> 12:39.780]  Another way you could do it, if you have some friends that run a commercial grow, maybe
[12:39.780 --> 12:44.940]  you can sneak your sample in with their sample batch and they'll let you get away with that.
[12:44.940 --> 12:45.940]  But that's illegal.
[12:45.940 --> 12:46.940]  I can't recommend that.
[12:46.940 --> 12:51.460]  I couldn't tell you that you do that, but I've heard of people allegedly possibly doing
[12:51.460 --> 12:52.460]  that.
[12:52.460 --> 12:53.740]  Keep in mind, Rasta Jeff is a fictional character.
[12:53.740 --> 12:56.300]  Anything we say here is all for entertainment purposes.
[12:56.300 --> 12:57.300]  Let's move forward.
[12:57.300 --> 12:59.640]  I do have another email here in front of me.
[12:59.640 --> 13:02.060]  This one says a little bit like this.
[13:02.060 --> 13:04.060]  It says, yo Rasta Jeff, I hope all is well.
[13:04.060 --> 13:06.140]  I have a grow question for you, buddy.
[13:06.140 --> 13:08.460]  That is my department of expertise.
[13:08.460 --> 13:14.460]  It says, if I reversed a female, has hella pollen sacks, but no pollen, could it be from
[13:14.460 --> 13:17.020]  too strong of an STS solution?
[13:17.020 --> 13:19.260]  Yes, it absolutely could.
[13:19.260 --> 13:20.900]  It could be from too strong.
[13:20.900 --> 13:21.900]  It could be too weak.
[13:21.900 --> 13:23.180]  It could be not enough sprays.
[13:23.180 --> 13:24.820]  It could be too many sprays.
[13:24.820 --> 13:28.960]  There are so many variables that can contribute to the STS not working.
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.900]  That's why when I do an STS spray, I always recommend spraying multiple clones of the
[13:33.900 --> 13:36.860]  same cultivar that you want to produce pollen of.
[13:36.860 --> 13:41.260]  That way you've got a different applications will produce different results.
[13:41.260 --> 13:44.900]  I'll hit one plant with 90, one with 80, one with 70.
[13:44.900 --> 13:47.020]  If I've got more plants, I'll spray one more often.
[13:47.020 --> 13:48.180]  I'll spray one less.
[13:48.180 --> 13:49.620]  I'll just do different shit.
[13:49.620 --> 13:51.580]  That way I know that something is going to work.
[13:51.580 --> 13:55.700]  I write down what I did to plant A, B, and C. I write down what worked.
[13:55.700 --> 13:58.540]  I remember that for the next time I grow that cultivar.
[13:58.540 --> 14:01.340]  I do intend to reverse it.
[14:01.340 --> 14:04.300]  Let me read more of the message here just to make sure I don't skip anything.
[14:04.300 --> 14:10.140]  It says, I started with a 50 mil part A and B to 400 distilled water, spraying five days,
[14:10.140 --> 14:11.140]  sprayed every three days.
[14:11.220 --> 14:12.780]  I see the problem.
[14:12.780 --> 14:16.260]  You only put, let's see, 50 mils parts A and B. That may work.
[14:16.260 --> 14:21.260]  If you used the right dilutions of the right amounts of products A and B, your half a gram
[14:21.260 --> 14:25.180]  and two and a half grams, you mix them in the distilled water, started spraying five
[14:25.180 --> 14:28.100]  days before flipping, sprayed every three days.
[14:28.100 --> 14:29.600]  The last spray was on day 20.
[14:29.600 --> 14:32.820]  What do you recommend?
[14:32.820 --> 14:35.140]  I also want to try to reverse this exact same strain.
[14:35.140 --> 14:38.140]  So I don't want to just move on until I'm sure she won't reverse.
[14:38.140 --> 14:40.220]  This is just the first try.
[14:40.300 --> 14:45.020]  When it comes to reversing plants, do not ever expect that first attempt to be completely
[14:45.020 --> 14:46.020]  successful.
[14:46.020 --> 14:49.460]  That is, sometimes that works, but some plants are very picky.
[14:49.460 --> 14:52.180]  It doesn't say what plant you are using.
[14:52.180 --> 14:53.420]  Some plants are very picky.
[14:53.420 --> 14:56.260]  Some plants will reverse very easily.
[14:56.260 --> 15:01.780]  What I would recommend is mix up a fresh batch of the silver thiosulfate, a brand new fresh
[15:01.780 --> 15:08.700]  batch, cut three clones of the same plant, spray one at 90, one at 80, one at 70% dilution
[15:08.700 --> 15:10.020]  and see what happens then.
[15:10.820 --> 15:14.940]  So let's try seven days before flip, then flip, then spray day one.
[15:14.940 --> 15:16.260]  Then you understand the pattern.
[15:16.260 --> 15:21.500]  Spray on the day one when you flip and then spray up to about day 24 and then let's see
[15:21.500 --> 15:22.500]  what happens.
[15:22.500 --> 15:24.780]  Maybe one of those will spit out the pollen for you.
[15:24.780 --> 15:26.780]  If not, I do have other recommendations.
[15:26.780 --> 15:28.380]  We may have to spend a little bit more money.
[15:28.380 --> 15:31.380]  We may have to step up our game, but we do have other options.
[15:31.380 --> 15:35.660]  Let's try different dilutions and see if a little stronger dilution or a little lighter
[15:35.660 --> 15:37.700]  dilution will work.
[15:37.700 --> 15:42.420]  Actually, if you can do more plants, let's spray one of them more frequently and one
[15:42.420 --> 15:43.740]  of them less frequently.
[15:43.740 --> 15:44.740]  Let's experiment a little.
[15:44.740 --> 15:46.700]  You've only got one sample.
[15:46.700 --> 15:48.080]  So this isn't scientific.
[15:48.080 --> 15:53.660]  This is all so many variables, so many anomalies because it is only one testing sample.
[15:53.660 --> 15:55.060]  Let's do the test again.
[15:55.060 --> 15:56.060]  Let's control it.
[15:56.060 --> 15:58.860]  Let's take a lot of notes and see what we get from, don't give up.
[15:58.860 --> 15:59.980]  You are absolutely correct.
[15:59.980 --> 16:01.660]  You say you don't want to just move on.
[16:01.660 --> 16:02.800]  Do not give up.
[16:02.800 --> 16:05.300]  Let's try the same plant multiple ways.
[16:05.300 --> 16:07.020]  You know that that one way didn't work.
[16:07.020 --> 16:10.580]  Let's see if we can get it to work a couple of other different ways.
[16:10.580 --> 16:13.980]  So if you're out there trying to reverse a plant and it didn't work the first time, don't
[16:13.980 --> 16:14.980]  get discouraged.
[16:14.980 --> 16:16.540]  I hope you took a lot of notes.
[16:16.540 --> 16:17.900]  I hope you're ready to try again.
[16:17.900 --> 16:21.520]  I hope you didn't have those girl plants all ready to go already and you've got female
[16:21.520 --> 16:23.820]  plants in the room that are not going to get pollinated.
[16:23.820 --> 16:25.700]  I hope we can try again.
[16:25.700 --> 16:26.980]  Don't get discouraged.
[16:26.980 --> 16:28.020]  Put science into it.
[16:28.020 --> 16:29.060]  Put some passion into it.
[16:29.060 --> 16:31.620]  That is why fem seeds are a little bit more expensive.
[16:31.620 --> 16:34.900]  You guys, we got to do a lot of work to make that stuff work.
[16:34.900 --> 16:35.900]  All right.
[16:35.900 --> 16:36.900]  All right.
[16:36.900 --> 16:37.900]  Dude, who did this come from?
[16:37.900 --> 16:39.300]  There is no name on this message.
[16:39.300 --> 16:40.300]  You know who you are.
[16:40.300 --> 16:42.020]  Thank you for the great question.
[16:42.020 --> 16:44.000]  I hope the STS works.
[16:44.000 --> 16:46.080]  Maybe watch that episode one more time.
[16:46.080 --> 16:47.720]  Make sure you're mixing properly.
[16:47.720 --> 16:49.000]  Then spray three plants.
[16:49.000 --> 16:50.000]  See how that goes.
[16:50.000 --> 16:54.060]  If you've got further questions, reach out because you know I would love to help you
[16:54.060 --> 16:55.060]  out.
[16:55.060 --> 16:56.060]  All right.
[16:56.060 --> 16:57.480]  I do have one more message in front of me that I'd like to read.
[16:57.480 --> 17:00.100]  It was not that one that I picked up right there.
[17:00.100 --> 17:01.660]  We're going to read this one.
[17:01.660 --> 17:02.660]  All right.
[17:02.660 --> 17:05.580]  After some shuffling, I found the message that I do want to read.
[17:05.580 --> 17:10.060]  This one comes from the Grow Help tab on the iRegenetics website.
[17:10.060 --> 17:11.060]  That's right.
[17:11.060 --> 17:18.820]  If you visit iRegenetics.com, I-R-I-E genetics.com, iRegenetics.com, there is a Grow Help tab.
[17:18.820 --> 17:22.660]  If you click on that Grow Help tab, it will ask you a few preliminary questions.
[17:22.660 --> 17:26.100]  We ask you what strains you're growing, if you're growing indoors or outdoors, what kind
[17:26.100 --> 17:29.900]  of lights you're using, just basic things like that to give me an idea of how to help
[17:29.900 --> 17:30.900]  you.
[17:30.900 --> 17:32.420]  Then at the bottom, it says, explain the problem.
[17:33.180 --> 17:34.820]  We let you explain your grow problem.
[17:34.820 --> 17:36.620]  Just a few details on this one.
[17:36.620 --> 17:40.900]  We're growing multiple strains, which include hood candy, 91 chemdababa.
[17:40.900 --> 17:42.380]  There's a couple of cool crosses in here.
[17:42.380 --> 17:43.900]  We're growing under LEDs.
[17:43.900 --> 17:45.020]  The plants are in flower.
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.700]  It says they're in week 19.
[17:46.700 --> 17:51.060]  That's got to be week 19 overall, because if you're flowering for 19 weeks, you're a
[17:51.060 --> 17:52.060]  fucking savage.
[17:52.060 --> 17:53.060]  It goes on.
[17:53.060 --> 17:54.060]  It says it's in cocoa.
[17:54.060 --> 17:57.540]  It got fed jacks.
[17:57.540 --> 17:58.820]  The temp is right.
[17:58.820 --> 17:59.820]  The humidity is cool.
[17:59.820 --> 18:01.460]  Then it says the problem.
[18:01.500 --> 18:03.020]  Hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[18:03.020 --> 18:04.900]  I used to be a Patreon member.
[18:04.900 --> 18:05.900]  We're not going to read all that.
[18:05.900 --> 18:08.860]  We're going to, so basically the issue I've been running into is powdery mildew toward
[18:08.860 --> 18:10.420]  the end of flower.
[18:10.420 --> 18:16.100]  That is a common issue, and I do know why based on the photos that came with this message.
[18:16.100 --> 18:19.220]  It says I'm at my wits end with how to correct this.
[18:19.220 --> 18:21.220]  My last run is about six weeks in.
[18:21.220 --> 18:26.380]  I had a PM flare up, so I knew I needed to change things up as well as do a super deep
[18:26.380 --> 18:27.380]  clean.
[18:27.380 --> 18:30.500]  I need to clean every fan blade and corner of my room.
[18:30.540 --> 18:35.660]  So for this run and veg, I stepped up my IPM with a rotating schedule of DefGuard and Dr.
[18:35.660 --> 18:40.100]  Zimes with a final application of MycoStop the day that I flipped, as well as I added
[18:40.100 --> 18:43.220]  a 16 inch oscillating fan in my little four by four.
[18:43.220 --> 18:47.460]  All right, so you got a lot of stuff going on in that four by four, a lot of preventative
[18:47.460 --> 18:48.460]  sprays.
[18:48.460 --> 18:51.140]  However, a lot of those preventative sprays don't stick around long enough.
[18:51.140 --> 18:55.140]  You're spraying at the end of veg, then you've got that nine week flowering cycle.
[18:55.140 --> 18:57.120]  About six weeks, the buds get chunky.
[18:57.120 --> 18:58.700]  We get a lot of activity from the leaves.
[18:58.700 --> 19:01.220]  A lot of water moving around in that small space.
[19:01.220 --> 19:02.220]  Then guess what?
[19:02.220 --> 19:04.560]  Ding, ding, powdery mildew pops up.
[19:04.560 --> 19:05.560]  It goes on.
[19:05.560 --> 19:10.020]  It says I added a second fan on the floor trying to create a cyclone effect below the
[19:10.020 --> 19:12.280]  canopy to push any stagnant air up.
[19:12.280 --> 19:13.280]  That is a good idea.
[19:13.280 --> 19:14.500]  And then it goes on.
[19:14.500 --> 19:16.660]  It says, so we're about to start week three.
[19:16.660 --> 19:20.700]  Last night I spotted two leaves with very small spots of powdery mildew on them.
[19:20.700 --> 19:23.580]  I'm at my wits end and I'm not sure what else I can do.
[19:23.580 --> 19:27.020]  I'll admit I have some fluctuations in my RH and temp.
[19:27.020 --> 19:28.300]  Never more than 10 points.
[19:28.900 --> 19:29.900]  Yeah, more than 10 points.
[19:29.900 --> 19:33.100]  That 10 points could be doing it, especially with some of the things that I see in this
[19:33.100 --> 19:34.780]  room we're going to talk about.
[19:34.780 --> 19:39.260]  It says I'm about to do a super heavy defoliation and I'm hoping that I'll be able to finish
[19:39.260 --> 19:41.100]  this run out, but I fear the worst.
[19:41.100 --> 19:43.420]  I'd love to hear your SOP for powdery mildew.
[19:43.420 --> 19:47.900]  I think you've heard, you mentioned cease before, but I would love your thoughts on
[19:47.900 --> 19:48.900]  this.
[19:48.900 --> 19:49.900]  All right.
[19:49.900 --> 19:53.900]  I've got pictures of this room and the first thing that I noticed is that those plants
[19:53.900 --> 19:56.380]  are way too close together.
[19:56.460 --> 19:59.340]  There are too many plants in there and it is too leafy.
[19:59.340 --> 20:06.100]  Our dude, Minds Eye Open said they were going to go in the room and do a heavy defoliation.
[20:06.100 --> 20:08.580]  That should have been happening much sooner.
[20:08.580 --> 20:12.620]  With as many plants as you've got in there, as much foliage as you've got in there, you
[20:12.620 --> 20:15.420]  are lucky that it took you this long to get powdery mildew.
[20:15.420 --> 20:17.500]  There's a lot of activity happening in the room.
[20:17.500 --> 20:18.660]  There are a lot of leaves touching.
[20:18.660 --> 20:21.740]  There are a lot of spaces where there are microclimates in there.
[20:21.740 --> 20:22.740]  There's a lot of moisture.
[20:22.740 --> 20:24.380]  There are a lot of microclimates.
[20:24.380 --> 20:25.580]  Perfect warmth in that room.
[20:25.780 --> 20:29.740]  You are always going to get powdery mildew unless you spread those plants apart, give
[20:29.740 --> 20:35.140]  them some room to breathe and do an extremely heavy defoliation in that room.
[20:35.140 --> 20:37.580]  It needs to be defoliated very heavily.
[20:37.580 --> 20:40.660]  I would go in there on day one of flower and take a lot of leaves off.
[20:40.660 --> 20:44.460]  Then when they grow back, I would go in in week three, then I'd go in a week six and
[20:44.460 --> 20:46.940]  then right before flower, I would strip them just about now.
[20:46.940 --> 20:49.940]  Right before harvest, I would strip them just about naked.
[20:49.940 --> 20:51.500]  You've got a lot of leaves in that room.
[20:51.500 --> 20:57.300]  I wouldn't have half as many leaves in that room as I see on these plants.
[20:57.300 --> 21:01.540]  So one of the first things to do would be a heavy, heavy defoliation.
[21:01.540 --> 21:05.140]  I'd go in there and just take off all of the leaves that you don't think are necessary.
[21:05.140 --> 21:07.520]  I did a defoliation episode recently.
[21:07.520 --> 21:08.520]  Give that a listen.
[21:08.520 --> 21:11.300]  Anything with a hint of powdery mildew, get rid of it.
[21:11.300 --> 21:15.620]  Then take all of those leaves, get them far from the grow, the trash, the dump, the landfill,
[21:15.620 --> 21:17.020]  whatever, get rid of them.
[21:17.020 --> 21:20.540]  Then clean up yourself, clean up your scissors, clean up everything real well.
[21:20.580 --> 21:24.380]  Now, if you want to talk about integrated pest management to help get rid of that powdery
[21:24.380 --> 21:27.420]  mildew, the first thing we need to do is correct the plants.
[21:27.420 --> 21:28.420]  Too much leaf.
[21:28.420 --> 21:31.020]  The second thing we need to do is correct the airflow.
[21:31.020 --> 21:35.260]  You may have a lot of moving air, but are you getting rid of the stagnant air, that
[21:35.260 --> 21:36.900]  old sweaty air?
[21:36.900 --> 21:37.900]  Is that going out somewhere?
[21:37.900 --> 21:40.060]  Are you evacuating that, exhausting that somewhere?
[21:40.060 --> 21:42.260]  Are you pulling in fresh air somehow?
[21:42.260 --> 21:43.460]  That may help you out.
[21:43.460 --> 21:47.100]  Also, let's get a lot of random movement going on in those plants.
[21:47.100 --> 21:49.660]  A fan is going to move the air one way all the time.
[21:49.780 --> 21:51.740]  Let's put another fan in there to make that air mix.
[21:51.740 --> 21:53.180]  You've got one on the floor.
[21:53.180 --> 21:55.440]  Let's mix the air as often as possible.
[21:55.440 --> 22:00.180]  Get a lot of air exchange, air mixing, new air, fresh air, no stagnant pockets in there.
[22:00.180 --> 22:03.480]  I think defoliating will really help your fans be effective.
[22:03.480 --> 22:06.660]  Right now, the fans aren't working past that first layer of plants.
[22:06.660 --> 22:10.780]  Every plant that is behind plant number one is not getting wind.
[22:10.780 --> 22:15.340]  There's so much leaf and so much foliage, you can't feel the wind through the forest,
[22:15.340 --> 22:17.340]  is what I think I'm trying to actually say.
[22:17.340 --> 22:23.340]  So defoliate, adjust the airflow in the room, adjust the air exchange in the room.
[22:23.340 --> 22:27.140]  That will also help you correct the VPD, the vapor pressure deficit.
[22:27.140 --> 22:31.140]  The relative humidity and the temperature will be more easily controllable by having
[22:31.140 --> 22:34.500]  less leaves because the leaves will be putting out less water.
[22:34.500 --> 22:36.060]  You'll have less humidity in the room.
[22:36.060 --> 22:37.060]  It will help you out.
[22:37.060 --> 22:38.580]  Also save you on some watering time.
[22:38.580 --> 22:41.780]  You'll be able to water less frequently because you don't have as many leaves in there to
[22:41.780 --> 22:43.180]  keep wet.
[22:43.500 --> 22:49.340]  Then if you really want to talk about more of an integrated pest management strategy
[22:49.340 --> 22:53.260]  to get rid of the powdery mildew, there are a few products that I do like.
[22:53.260 --> 22:55.620]  You did say that you know I mentioned Ceese.
[22:55.620 --> 22:56.620]  Cease is a great product.
[22:56.620 --> 22:58.140]  I do like to spray that one.
[22:58.140 --> 23:02.140]  I also like a couple of products called B52 and Double Nickel.
[23:02.140 --> 23:05.780]  Those are also great products for taking care of the powdery mildew.
[23:05.780 --> 23:10.660]  Also sometimes if it gets real bad, it wouldn't be uncommon for me to hit those plants with
[23:10.660 --> 23:16.180]  H2O2, a very, very low dilution of H2O2 or hydrogen peroxide.
[23:16.180 --> 23:19.660]  People are going to say that the hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 are the exact same thing.
[23:19.660 --> 23:20.980]  However, they are not.
[23:20.980 --> 23:23.420]  There are other products added into that H2O2.
[23:23.420 --> 23:25.660]  If it was the same thing, it would not be labeled H2O2.
[23:25.660 --> 23:27.340]  I think it would just say hydrogen peroxide.
[23:27.340 --> 23:29.100]  There's other stuff in that bottle.
[23:29.100 --> 23:31.620]  So I've been corrected on that before.
[23:31.620 --> 23:32.620]  It's a different thing.
[23:32.620 --> 23:36.940]  The 30% hydrogen peroxide and the H2O2 product are different things.
[23:36.940 --> 23:37.940]  There's also Xerotal.
[23:38.100 --> 23:40.740]  Xerotal does have other stuff in there.
[23:40.740 --> 23:45.060]  Those are all three similar but different products that will work very well for the
[23:45.060 --> 23:46.060]  powdery mildew.
[23:46.060 --> 23:51.700]  That will dissolve the powdery mildew, dilute it very low, spray it directly onto the plants,
[23:51.700 --> 23:56.500]  wash it, watch it wash and eat that powdery mildew right off of your plants.
[23:56.500 --> 23:57.500]  All right.
[23:57.500 --> 23:58.940]  So those are products I would recommend.
[23:58.940 --> 24:01.100]  I would do the Cease, the Double Nickel.
[24:01.100 --> 24:03.460]  I think the other one was called B52.
[24:03.460 --> 24:04.900]  What's the one that turns the water purple?
[24:04.900 --> 24:06.260]  I can't remember that one right now.
[24:06.260 --> 24:07.260]  Grandivo.
[24:07.580 --> 24:10.700]  Grandivo may be good for powdery mildew if I remember correctly.
[24:10.700 --> 24:13.100]  Then also there is Xerotal.
[24:13.100 --> 24:17.380]  There is hydrogen peroxide and there is H2O2.
[24:17.380 --> 24:19.300]  Please be very careful using those products.
[24:19.300 --> 24:20.300]  They are very caustic.
[24:20.300 --> 24:21.300]  They will burn your skin.
[24:21.300 --> 24:22.420]  They will burn your eyes.
[24:22.420 --> 24:26.540]  They can burn your plants if you do not dilute them quite properly.
[24:26.540 --> 24:27.540]  Be careful.
[24:27.540 --> 24:30.100]  Read the freaking label.
[24:30.100 --> 24:31.100]  Follow the rules.
[24:31.100 --> 24:32.260]  All right.
[24:32.260 --> 24:34.020]  My dude, mine's eye open.
[24:34.020 --> 24:36.660]  I hope I gave you some useful advice here.
[24:37.060 --> 24:38.060]  Defoliate that room, dude.
[24:38.060 --> 24:42.380]  There are a lot of leaves, a lot of foliage, a lot of water happening in that room.
[24:42.380 --> 24:45.700]  The less leaf in the room, the less opportunity for powdery mildew.
[24:45.700 --> 24:49.260]  I describe it as if there are no hotels, the hippies won't come to party.
[24:49.260 --> 24:51.700]  If there are no campsites, the hippies won't camp out.
[24:51.700 --> 24:55.700]  If you get rid of all the campsites, there's nowhere for the bugs, nowhere for the mildew.
[24:55.700 --> 24:57.580]  It will give you some more success.
[24:57.580 --> 24:59.860]  Set yourself up for success, my dude.
[24:59.860 --> 25:01.860]  Defoliate, correct the room.
[25:01.860 --> 25:06.820]  Again, if you still have problems, apply an integrated pest management strategy that would
[25:06.820 --> 25:11.620]  include I may just spray down that whole room with Xerotol or the hydrogen peroxide.
[25:11.620 --> 25:15.900]  I may just spray down the whole freaking room just to make sure there's nothing in there
[25:15.900 --> 25:17.140]  just to clean it all up.
[25:17.140 --> 25:18.140]  All right.
[25:18.140 --> 25:19.140]  Mine's eye open.
[25:19.140 --> 25:20.140]  Thanks again for the great question.
[25:20.140 --> 25:22.500]  I do look forward to hearing back from you with the follow-up.
[25:22.500 --> 25:25.580]  Let me see if my advice helped you out at all.
