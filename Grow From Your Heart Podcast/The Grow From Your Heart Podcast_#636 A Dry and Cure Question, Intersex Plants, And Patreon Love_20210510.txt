[00:01.790 --> 00:10.550]  Yeah, here we go.
[00:10.550 --> 00:12.070]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:12.070 --> 00:18.030]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 636 of the Grow From Your
[00:18.030 --> 00:19.030]  Heart Podcast.
[00:19.030 --> 00:22.890]  In this episode, I'm going to focus mainly on Patreon questions.
[00:22.890 --> 00:27.070]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:27.070 --> 00:32.110]  Of course, the 710 Club are those folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:32.110 --> 00:33.110]  level or higher.
[00:33.110 --> 00:36.790]  So, with no further ado, let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[00:36.790 --> 00:40.110]  thank you shout out to my friend, Brohan78.
[00:40.110 --> 00:42.670]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to 13Spark.

[01:05.950 --> 01:09.270]  And then let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout
[01:09.270 --> 01:12.230]  out to a longtime supporter and a big friend.
[01:12.230 --> 01:16.750]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to The BAFSTA.
[01:16.750 --> 01:21.590]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:31.590 --> 01:33.990]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:33.990 --> 01:38.470]  And of course, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:38.470 --> 01:40.710]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:40.710 --> 01:44.110]  Maybe you're in the garden, maybe you're driving, maybe you're at work, who knows what you're
[01:44.110 --> 01:45.110]  doing.
[01:45.110 --> 01:47.910]  Maybe you can't reach into your pocket, pull out your phone right now.
[01:47.910 --> 01:50.350]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:50.350 --> 01:54.150]  The link is in the notes whenever you are ready.
[01:54.150 --> 01:57.830]  And seriously, thank you for all of the continued Patreon support.
[01:57.830 --> 02:00.270]  I'm going to talk a little bit about Patreon in a moment.
[02:00.270 --> 02:03.550]  First, let's talk about the seed exchange event.
[02:03.550 --> 02:04.550]  That's right.
[02:04.550 --> 02:09.430]  The secret stash brought to you by groovy gravy is coming up May 22nd at a secret location
[02:09.430 --> 02:10.430]  in Denver.
[02:10.430 --> 02:11.430]  That's right.
[02:11.430 --> 02:13.950]  When you get your tickets and the event gets closer to happening, you will get the exact
[02:13.950 --> 02:14.950]  location.
[02:14.950 --> 02:15.950]  Don't worry.
[02:15.950 --> 02:16.950]  It's a great venue.
[02:16.950 --> 02:17.950]  It's a great spot.
[02:17.950 --> 02:18.950]  Parking will be available.
[02:18.950 --> 02:19.950]  You will be safe.
[02:19.950 --> 02:21.630]  It's a good COVID friendly venue.
[02:21.630 --> 02:23.550]  We're going to do things correctly here.
[02:23.550 --> 02:29.390]  The groovy gravy secret stash seed exchange event happening May 22nd in Denver.
[02:29.390 --> 02:33.390]  If you are interested, find the link in the show notes and the video description.
[02:33.390 --> 02:36.350]  There's a link with instructions, how to get tickets.
[02:36.350 --> 02:38.950]  All the details you need will be in that link.
[02:38.950 --> 02:39.950]  Follow that link.
[02:39.950 --> 02:45.910]  Also use coupon code Rasta Jeff and you will save 20% off your ticket pricing.
[02:45.910 --> 02:49.030]  Once again, all of the VIP tickets are sold out.
[02:49.030 --> 02:51.110]  Booths are sold out to the best of my knowledge.
[02:51.110 --> 02:54.510]  I cannot do anything to get you VIP tickets or a booth.
[02:54.510 --> 02:56.950]  The best I can do for you is give you this link.
[02:56.950 --> 02:58.350]  You can get tickets there.
[02:58.350 --> 03:01.670]  The other good thing I can offer you is coupon code Rasta Jeff.
[03:01.670 --> 03:03.470]  All one word Rasta Jeff.
[03:03.470 --> 03:04.970]  That will save you 20% off.
[03:04.970 --> 03:09.670]  If you're looking for any other details or information, you of course will have to contact
[03:09.670 --> 03:13.910]  the groovy gravy group and they will get you figured out, get you situated.
[03:13.910 --> 03:16.230]  Again, I am a participant in this event.
[03:16.230 --> 03:17.590]  I'm not throwing the event.
[03:17.590 --> 03:19.310]  I am a paid vendor.
[03:19.310 --> 03:22.950]  I can't give you any hookups, any deals, can't pull any strings for you.
[03:22.950 --> 03:24.230]  A lot of people have asked.
[03:24.230 --> 03:25.230]  That's why I'm saying this.
[03:25.230 --> 03:27.990]  I can get you that coupon code Rasta Jeff.
[03:27.990 --> 03:29.110]  Saves you 20%.
[03:29.110 --> 03:30.110]  That's the best I could do.
[03:30.110 --> 03:34.030]  I look forward to seeing all of my friends in Denver on the 22nd.
[03:34.030 --> 03:35.430]  Can't wait to see you there.
[03:35.430 --> 03:38.030]  Also you guys, I was on the Neighborhood Hang.
[03:38.030 --> 03:39.510]  My friends have started a podcast.
[03:39.510 --> 03:40.510]  It's kind of a podcast.
[03:40.510 --> 03:41.510]  It's a video show.
[03:41.510 --> 03:43.470]  Maybe it's a vodcast if you will.
[03:43.470 --> 03:47.910]  They've got a show on YouTube called the Neighborhood Grows Grow Show.
[03:47.910 --> 03:48.910]  It is a great show.
[03:49.510 --> 03:50.510]  It's mainly hosted by my buddy Raptor.
[03:50.510 --> 03:52.670]  There are a lot of great faces on there.
[03:52.670 --> 03:54.070]  We got OG Purple Thumbs on there.
[03:54.070 --> 03:55.790]  We got Dave on there.
[03:55.790 --> 03:56.790]  Duck Foot's on there.
[03:56.790 --> 03:58.510]  Of course, Lori is on there.
[03:58.510 --> 03:59.510]  Tent Hangs Out on there.
[03:59.510 --> 04:00.510]  There are a lot of great people.
[04:00.510 --> 04:01.510]  I'm going to forget somebody.
[04:01.510 --> 04:05.870]  There's a lot of great friends and family that hang out and congregate in the neighborhood.
[04:05.870 --> 04:07.630]  They've got a great podcast happening.
[04:07.630 --> 04:09.070]  I was a guest on Monday.
[04:09.070 --> 04:13.510]  If you did not catch the live show on Monday, I highly, because I do almost everything quite
[04:13.510 --> 04:16.950]  highly, I recommend you find the Neighborhood Grows Show.
[04:16.990 --> 04:19.670]  Not only check out the episode I was on, because I had a good time.
[04:19.670 --> 04:20.670]  I was very comfortable.
[04:20.670 --> 04:21.670]  I was very relaxed.
[04:21.670 --> 04:25.430]  I felt like I was just hanging out with my bros, just doing a show.
[04:25.430 --> 04:28.390]  It wasn't even really an interview, but they interviewed me quite well.
[04:28.390 --> 04:30.830]  I recommend you find the episode I was on.
[04:30.830 --> 04:32.950]  Also subscribe to their channel.
[04:32.950 --> 04:36.790]  Watch all of the other previous and subsequent episodes.
[04:36.790 --> 04:37.790]  Give them some support.
[04:37.790 --> 04:39.070]  Geez, I'm going to catch my breath.
[04:39.070 --> 04:40.070]  Give them some support.
[04:40.070 --> 04:42.110]  That was harder to say than it looked.
[04:42.110 --> 04:43.110]  Support the gang.
[04:43.110 --> 04:44.110]  Support the crew.
[04:44.110 --> 04:45.110]  Those are friends of mine.
[04:45.110 --> 04:46.110]  I got nothing but love and respect for them.
[04:46.270 --> 04:48.710]  You got to spread this cannabis love around.
[04:48.710 --> 04:50.790]  Pass the love just like you do a joint.
[04:50.790 --> 04:54.950]  Support my friends on the Neighborhood Grows.
[04:54.950 --> 04:59.670]  The next order of business we need to talk about here is I am a shit talker when it comes
[04:59.670 --> 05:00.670]  to smoking rosin.
[05:00.670 --> 05:03.310]  Boy, I am not a big fan of rosin.
[05:03.310 --> 05:08.510]  75% of the time, your rosin tastes like a Popsicle stick or burnt popcorn.
[05:08.510 --> 05:13.070]  I cannot stand the fucking flavor of a Popsicle stick on my tongue.
[05:13.070 --> 05:16.870]  If you put a tongue depressor on my tongue, Popsicle stick on my tongue, I can feel it
[05:16.870 --> 05:21.110]  in my bones, in my body right now, this weird, they call it the chills.
[05:21.110 --> 05:23.310]  It's an uncomfortable fucking feeling.
[05:23.310 --> 05:26.310]  I got, I don't know if you call it chicken skins or goose bumps, whatever the fuck you
[05:26.310 --> 05:27.590]  call it, wherever you are.
[05:27.590 --> 05:29.550]  My skin's crawling, doing weird shit.
[05:29.550 --> 05:30.870]  I don't like a tongue depressor.
[05:30.870 --> 05:33.990]  I don't like that unfinished wood texture in my mouth.
[05:33.990 --> 05:35.150]  It's disgusting.
[05:35.150 --> 05:40.150]  A lot of times, that's what rosin tastes like to me, burnt popcorn and a tongue depressor.
[05:40.150 --> 05:42.510]  It makes my tongue and my face make this terrible shape.
[05:42.950 --> 05:47.390]  I go, oh, and you can tell by looking that it looks like I just took a bite of poop.
[05:47.390 --> 05:48.390]  It's not pleasant.
[05:48.390 --> 05:53.550]  Anyway, I did take a dab of some rosin the past couple of days that was made by a friend
[05:53.550 --> 05:58.270]  that was a gift that we can't talk too much about how it landed here and who got it to
[05:58.270 --> 05:59.270]  me.
[05:59.270 --> 06:00.790]  However, they know who they are.
[06:00.790 --> 06:03.230]  I talked about another product in a previous episode.
[06:03.230 --> 06:05.110]  My friend wondered if this was him.
[06:05.110 --> 06:07.350]  This time, bro, I am talking about your rosin.
[06:07.350 --> 06:08.350]  The shit was good.
[06:08.350 --> 06:09.350]  It was tasty.
[06:09.350 --> 06:10.810]  I got a nice buzz from it.
[06:10.810 --> 06:14.610]  It was heavy on the lungs and the flavor changed so many times.
[06:14.610 --> 06:16.290]  There were two jars.
[06:16.290 --> 06:18.730]  One honestly is not my favorite, but it's smokeable.
[06:18.730 --> 06:21.090]  The other one, I went back for more.
[06:21.090 --> 06:22.090]  I do approve.
[06:22.090 --> 06:23.770]  I do enjoy the rosin.
[06:23.770 --> 06:24.890]  You guys are getting better.
[06:24.890 --> 06:29.010]  The rosin makers are getting better at making rosin is what I've noticed.
[06:29.010 --> 06:31.730]  You're learning the temperatures, the times, the techniques.
[06:31.730 --> 06:33.930]  It's all being dialed in and it's getting better.
[06:33.930 --> 06:36.210]  That being said, I'm still a batter fan.
[06:36.210 --> 06:39.490]  There's nothing better than some good green dot batter.
[06:39.490 --> 06:41.170]  They do not pay me to say that.
[06:41.170 --> 06:44.530]  Actually, I just go buy all my product at the dispensary just like you do.
[06:44.530 --> 06:46.050]  Green dot doesn't email me, message me.
[06:46.050 --> 06:47.850]  We have no relationship.
[06:47.850 --> 06:48.850]  Good product.
[06:48.850 --> 06:49.850]  All right.
[06:49.850 --> 06:53.570]  The reason I'm stoned and rambly is because of the ... I can't think of the name of the
[06:53.570 --> 06:56.410]  strain that I smoked, but it was some rosin and it was delicious.
[06:56.410 --> 06:57.410]  It'll come to me.
[06:57.410 --> 06:59.370]  I think it was some ... I don't want to say the wrong one.
[06:59.370 --> 07:00.370]  I know what it was.
[07:00.370 --> 07:02.290]  My brain will not allow me to say it.
[07:02.290 --> 07:06.370]  By the end of this episode, maybe I'll remember or I'll press pause, go find it, then tell
[07:06.370 --> 07:07.370]  you the real name.
[07:07.370 --> 07:08.370]  It's one word.
[07:08.370 --> 07:09.370]  It's one word.
[07:09.450 --> 07:10.450]  I don't know the name of it.
[07:10.450 --> 07:13.130]  It just won't come to my head because I'm fucking plenty stoned.
[07:13.130 --> 07:14.130]  All right.
[07:14.130 --> 07:15.130]  Where are we going from there?
[07:15.130 --> 07:16.650]  It is springtime.
[07:16.650 --> 07:18.610]  This is where I could use your help.
[07:18.610 --> 07:19.850]  I do a lot of podcasting.
[07:19.850 --> 07:21.290]  I'm putting out a lot here.
[07:21.290 --> 07:24.570]  I'd like some feedback, some replies, some information.
[07:24.570 --> 07:29.370]  This I guess is what we're going to call the call to action in this episode.
[07:29.370 --> 07:30.370]  It is springtime.
[07:30.370 --> 07:31.970]  I was out today driving around, running some errands.
[07:31.970 --> 07:35.410]  You'll notice I'm not wearing a hoodie, no long sleeve shirt in this episode.
[07:35.410 --> 07:37.450]  Rocking a t-shirt and jeans and sneakers.
[07:37.530 --> 07:40.050]  It is finally freaking nice outside.
[07:40.050 --> 07:41.330]  It is the springtime.
[07:41.330 --> 07:43.570]  Spring is upon us.
[07:43.570 --> 07:44.730]  People are looking lovely out there.
[07:44.730 --> 07:46.410]  The sunshine's got people in a good mood.
[07:46.410 --> 07:49.090]  Also they're driving like a dipshit, but that's beside the point.
[07:49.090 --> 07:53.770]  What I'm getting at is I want to make some spring and summer iRegenetics and grow from
[07:53.770 --> 07:55.090]  your heart merchandise.
[07:55.090 --> 07:56.890]  However, that is not my niche.
[07:56.890 --> 07:57.890]  I'm not the best at that.
[07:57.890 --> 07:59.050]  I'm better at podcasting.
[07:59.050 --> 08:02.010]  I am better at being in the grow, making seeds.
[08:02.010 --> 08:03.450]  Those are the things I should focus on.
[08:03.450 --> 08:04.970]  I'm going to ask you for help.
[08:04.970 --> 08:09.210]  The next door out there is a clothing designer, somebody with some cool artwork, somebody
[08:09.210 --> 08:12.210]  that says it is my turn to step up and help Rasta Jeff.
[08:12.210 --> 08:18.370]  What I'm looking for is some spring apparel designs, things I can have printed in mass
[08:18.370 --> 08:21.930]  that aren't super expensive and I can put them on my Etsy store and get them out to
[08:21.930 --> 08:25.450]  the people so they can rock some new designs for the spring.
[08:25.450 --> 08:27.930]  I do have the green and the orange shirts.
[08:27.930 --> 08:29.410]  Those are going to look good for spring and summer.
[08:29.410 --> 08:30.410]  That purple shirt will look good.
[08:30.410 --> 08:31.890]  I'll replenish those.
[08:31.890 --> 08:34.850]  But we need some new designs, maybe brand new merch, new ideas.
[08:35.250 --> 08:37.930]  I've expired, expended, exhausted.
[08:37.930 --> 08:38.930]  That's the word.
[08:38.930 --> 08:40.890]  I've exhausted my brain on merch ideas.
[08:40.890 --> 08:43.530]  I'm more focused on growing, breeding, and podcasting.
[08:43.530 --> 08:45.050]  So I'd like your help.
[08:45.050 --> 08:47.530]  What do you want with the iRegenetics branding on it?
[08:47.530 --> 08:50.530]  What would you rock with the podcast logo on it?
[08:50.530 --> 08:51.690]  Where do we go next?
[08:51.690 --> 08:55.850]  Honestly, that is not my avenue, my route, my wheelhouse.
[08:55.850 --> 08:56.850]  I'm better at this stuff.
[08:56.850 --> 08:59.570]  So I'm going to focus here and I'm asking for your help.
[08:59.570 --> 09:01.650]  What merchandise is next?
[09:01.650 --> 09:02.770]  What do you think I could put out?
[09:02.770 --> 09:05.690]  I'd like to put out merchandise that works well.
[09:05.690 --> 09:06.850]  I sell seeds.
[09:06.850 --> 09:09.450]  So what would go well with the seeds I put out?
[09:09.450 --> 09:10.570]  Shirts are cool.
[09:11.490 --> 09:12.490]  Hats are cool.
[09:12.490 --> 09:13.450]  Stuff like that is great.
[09:13.450 --> 09:14.650]  Stickers and things are awesome.
[09:14.650 --> 09:16.530]  But what are some other products maybe
[09:16.530 --> 09:18.530]  that you could see branded that you think
[09:18.530 --> 09:21.370]  would be beneficial to you and me as well?
[09:21.370 --> 09:23.570]  And we could work together and get them in your hands.
[09:23.570 --> 09:24.410]  All right.
[09:24.410 --> 09:25.890]  I feel like I made my piece clear there.
[09:25.890 --> 09:27.050]  You know what I'm looking for.
[09:27.050 --> 09:28.090]  I need some merchandise help.
[09:28.090 --> 09:31.250]  Also, if you draw stuff, if you make logos, make designs,
[09:31.250 --> 09:33.650]  and you want to make like a certain color T-shirt,
[09:33.650 --> 09:36.450]  tank top, something, we need merchandise for the ladies.
[09:36.450 --> 09:38.850]  I don't have any ladies specific merchandise
[09:38.850 --> 09:40.490]  and the ladies look great out there in the summer.
[09:40.490 --> 09:42.090]  So we got to get them looking good.
[09:42.090 --> 09:43.490]  Whatever's on your mind that you think of,
[09:43.490 --> 09:46.010]  if you draw, if you create, send me an idea.
[09:46.010 --> 09:46.930]  Trust me.
[09:46.930 --> 09:48.610]  If you create something for me,
[09:48.610 --> 09:51.130]  you will be heavily compensated.
[09:51.130 --> 09:51.970]  Ask Dave.
[09:51.970 --> 09:52.810]  Dave does me favors.
[09:52.810 --> 09:54.690]  Dave gets well taken care of.
[09:54.690 --> 09:55.570]  I'm generous.
[09:55.570 --> 09:56.490]  I'm friendly.
[09:56.490 --> 09:58.250]  Anything I'm going to profit from,
[09:58.250 --> 10:00.530]  I promise you will profit from as well.
[10:00.570 --> 10:03.290]  If you do work for me, I turn the money around.
[10:03.290 --> 10:04.130]  It goes back.
[10:04.130 --> 10:05.890]  You'll get seeds, you'll get gifts, you'll get merchandise.
[10:05.890 --> 10:07.410]  You'll get whatever you ask for.
[10:07.410 --> 10:08.330]  I'll make it fair to you.
[10:08.330 --> 10:09.170]  So thank you.
[10:10.130 --> 10:12.490]  That was a long ramble on just a little basic request
[10:12.490 --> 10:14.970]  for some help with merchandise, but fuck.
[10:14.970 --> 10:15.810]  You know what I mean?
[10:15.810 --> 10:17.490]  We take dabs, we get rambling.
[10:17.490 --> 10:18.330]  All right.
[10:18.330 --> 10:19.770]  We're going to jump into these Patreon messages.
[10:19.770 --> 10:21.410]  I think I've covered all of the important part
[10:21.410 --> 10:22.610]  at the start here.
[10:23.610 --> 10:24.450]  Yeah.
[10:24.450 --> 10:26.330]  We've got a message that came from Patreon.
[10:26.330 --> 10:28.370]  This one comes from our friend,
[10:28.370 --> 10:30.450]  Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[10:31.250 --> 10:32.170]  And it says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[10:32.170 --> 10:33.850]  I've been keeping up to date on each show
[10:33.850 --> 10:35.050]  and I appreciate the hard work,
[10:35.050 --> 10:36.850]  but I haven't heard from you in a minute.
[10:36.850 --> 10:38.570]  I totally understand you're a busy guy.
[10:38.570 --> 10:40.770]  I really just wanted to make sure
[10:40.770 --> 10:42.530]  you're getting my contribution
[10:42.530 --> 10:43.810]  and that you got my messages
[10:43.810 --> 10:45.730]  about my business name being shouted out.
[10:45.730 --> 10:47.850]  So I can address two things here right now,
[10:47.850 --> 10:50.050]  which are great things to talk about.
[10:50.050 --> 10:52.410]  Yes, I did get your message about giving you the shout out
[10:52.410 --> 10:53.570]  for the correct name.
[10:53.570 --> 10:54.770]  Let's recap that.
[10:54.770 --> 10:56.850]  In a previous episode, I did mention
[10:56.850 --> 10:58.770]  that I give you shout outs based on the names
[10:58.770 --> 11:00.090]  I've got on Patreon.
[11:00.730 --> 11:02.570]  I don't know what name you signed up under.
[11:02.570 --> 11:03.810]  I don't know what your real name is.
[11:03.810 --> 11:04.930]  I don't know your Instagram name.
[11:04.930 --> 11:06.370]  I don't know your surname.
[11:06.370 --> 11:08.050]  I've got your name from Patreon.
[11:08.050 --> 11:09.770]  I said Instagram a moment ago, maybe.
[11:09.770 --> 11:11.370]  I've got your Patreon name here on a paper.
[11:11.370 --> 11:12.770]  That's what I give you a shout out to
[11:12.770 --> 11:14.850]  because that's the info I have got.
[11:14.850 --> 11:16.890]  If you'd like me to shout out a different name,
[11:16.890 --> 11:18.450]  you've got to message me.
[11:18.450 --> 11:20.050]  I will print out the paper that says,
[11:20.050 --> 11:21.450]  hey, shout me out at this.
[11:21.450 --> 11:24.570]  I'll try to correlate the two names on the paper
[11:24.570 --> 11:27.730]  and remember to start using your requested shout out.
[11:28.290 --> 11:31.090]  Our friend at Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[11:31.090 --> 11:33.930]  Yes, brother, I did receive your request
[11:33.930 --> 11:36.290]  to be shouted out as Sacred Tree Organic Farms.
[11:36.290 --> 11:38.810]  Let's take a big moment and give a big salute.
[11:38.810 --> 11:40.130]  A Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[11:40.130 --> 11:40.970]  Thank you.
[11:40.970 --> 11:43.610]  Shout out to our friends at Sacred Tree Organic Farms
[11:43.610 --> 11:45.930]  for their continued support through Patreon.
[11:45.930 --> 11:47.770]  Now, here's something else I want to address
[11:47.770 --> 11:49.290]  while I've got this topic open.
[11:49.290 --> 11:51.170]  I'm gonna make sure I covered this.
[11:51.170 --> 11:53.650]  Getting your support, you got your shout out.
[11:53.650 --> 11:54.850]  Big love, big respect.
[11:54.850 --> 11:55.690]  Thank you for that.
[11:55.690 --> 11:57.570]  Then it says, take care, brother.
[11:58.410 --> 12:00.050]  Bro, you take care as well and thank you for the support.
[12:00.050 --> 12:03.290]  Thank you for the opening so that I can open up this box
[12:03.290 --> 12:04.650]  and talk about this topic.
[12:07.330 --> 12:09.850]  Now, the part I want to talk about is,
[12:09.850 --> 12:14.330]  there's one of me and there are over 250 patrons
[12:14.330 --> 12:15.570]  at this time.
[12:15.570 --> 12:18.810]  I'm grateful for each and every one of you,
[12:18.810 --> 12:22.050]  but it is hard to give each and every one of you
[12:22.050 --> 12:23.290]  undivided attention.
[12:23.290 --> 12:25.050]  So if you've sent me an email,
[12:25.050 --> 12:27.610]  if you've sent me a request, a message,
[12:27.610 --> 12:29.530]  I don't hate you, I'm not mad at you.
[12:29.530 --> 12:31.770]  I love you with all of my heart
[12:31.770 --> 12:33.650]  from the bottom of my long dreadlocks.
[12:33.650 --> 12:36.090]  I love and appreciate each and every one of you.
[12:37.530 --> 12:41.010]  But my inboxes have just become ridiculous and unmanageable.
[12:41.010 --> 12:43.090]  I'm trying, I'm doing my best, you guys.
[12:43.090 --> 12:44.610]  I get so many messages.
[12:44.610 --> 12:46.410]  Patreon becomes a priority, of course,
[12:46.410 --> 12:48.890]  because you do send funding with that.
[12:48.890 --> 12:49.890]  I feel like if you send money,
[12:49.890 --> 12:51.130]  I should pay attention to you first.
[12:51.130 --> 12:54.050]  You paid for me to look at the messages, I do.
[12:54.050 --> 12:55.370]  What I don't want is people to think
[12:55.370 --> 12:57.450]  that they're giving me financial support
[12:57.450 --> 12:58.690]  and I'm ignoring you.
[12:58.690 --> 13:02.130]  I am getting a lot of support, a lot of messages,
[13:02.130 --> 13:07.130]  and there are 250 patrons, 30,000 Instagram followers,
[13:08.050 --> 13:11.330]  60-something thousand cannabis followers,
[13:11.330 --> 13:14.650]  plus the 14,000 unanswered emails in my inbox.
[13:14.650 --> 13:16.970]  And the thing about emails that I've discovered,
[13:16.970 --> 13:20.010]  I will sit here at this table and put on music
[13:20.010 --> 13:22.370]  just loud enough not to distract me, just to get me focused.
[13:22.370 --> 13:24.490]  I'll take a couple of dabs to get me in the zone.
[13:24.490 --> 13:26.050]  I'll get some snacks in my hand.
[13:26.050 --> 13:27.690]  So I'm just shoving snacks into my mouth
[13:27.690 --> 13:28.810]  and answering emails.
[13:28.810 --> 13:30.250]  Hours will go by.
[13:30.250 --> 13:32.090]  I will have answered a couple of hundred emails
[13:32.090 --> 13:33.490]  and then guess what happens?
[13:34.730 --> 13:36.530]  Those people all reply.
[13:36.530 --> 13:39.210]  So it's like every hundred emails I send,
[13:39.210 --> 13:41.490]  50 more reply, I only catch up halfway.
[13:41.490 --> 13:43.410]  I'm not complaining, I love it.
[13:43.410 --> 13:44.650]  It is a sign of success.
[13:44.650 --> 13:46.410]  It is a sign of longevity.
[13:46.410 --> 13:49.170]  But I don't want you guys to feel like you're being ignored
[13:49.170 --> 13:50.970]  or neglected or whatever.
[13:50.970 --> 13:51.970]  I love you guys.
[13:52.490 --> 13:53.650]  Please don't stop with the message,
[13:53.650 --> 13:55.370]  but be patient with me.
[13:55.370 --> 13:56.810]  Realize it's just me, dude.
[13:57.770 --> 13:59.050]  That's why it's quality.
[13:59.050 --> 14:02.290]  People say hire an intern, hire somebody to help you.
[14:02.290 --> 14:06.050]  I don't believe or trust that anybody will have the passion,
[14:06.050 --> 14:09.050]  enthusiasm, the care, the eye for detail
[14:09.050 --> 14:11.770]  for the seed company, the emails, the podcast.
[14:11.770 --> 14:13.330]  It's all got to be me.
[14:13.330 --> 14:15.050]  That's why it's successful.
[14:15.050 --> 14:18.170]  Maybe that's an ego thing, but I know it's working now.
[14:18.170 --> 14:20.530]  The only thing that's lacking is I'm not getting enough done
[14:20.570 --> 14:21.970]  but as a business owner,
[14:21.970 --> 14:24.210]  if you can't catch up with the work, that's a good thing.
[14:24.210 --> 14:26.530]  That means you've got a business that's working,
[14:26.530 --> 14:27.490]  it's flowing.
[14:27.490 --> 14:30.010]  When I take a break and go, I'm bored, all my work's done,
[14:30.010 --> 14:31.210]  that's when I fucked up.
[14:31.210 --> 14:32.530]  That's when there's a problem.
[14:32.530 --> 14:35.370]  So please don't ever feel like I'm ignoring you,
[14:35.370 --> 14:37.930]  disrespecting you, blowing you off.
[14:37.930 --> 14:39.090]  I am up late.
[14:39.090 --> 14:40.930]  I start my day by answering messages.
[14:40.930 --> 14:42.690]  I finish my day by answering messages.
[14:42.690 --> 14:44.730]  My girlfriend's like, hey, do you ever stop working?
[14:44.730 --> 14:45.970]  And I'm like, I wish.
[14:45.970 --> 14:47.370]  Like I'm totally paying attention to you,
[14:47.370 --> 14:49.730]  but also I've got to answer these Patreon messages.
[14:49.730 --> 14:51.690]  So shout out to her for being awesome
[14:51.690 --> 14:53.210]  and putting up with the 24 hour work,
[14:53.210 --> 14:54.930]  but also you guys I'm trying.
[14:54.930 --> 14:55.970]  And I think I've made my point.
[14:55.970 --> 14:57.450]  I'm just stoned and rambly.
[14:57.450 --> 14:58.290]  I love you guys.
[14:58.290 --> 14:59.130]  I'm not ignoring you.
[14:59.130 --> 14:59.970]  It's just me.
[14:59.970 --> 15:05.020]  I'm gonna take a drink.
[15:05.900 --> 15:07.020]  All right.
[15:07.020 --> 15:08.820]  I did cover that topic quite well.
[15:08.820 --> 15:10.340]  We beat the shit out of that dead horse.
[15:10.340 --> 15:13.820]  Let's move on to another topic that is more grow focused,
[15:13.820 --> 15:16.300]  something we could talk about and learn something here.
[15:16.300 --> 15:18.780]  This one came from our friend, Cyncy11 on Patreon.
[15:18.780 --> 15:20.700]  Big shout out to my buddy, Cyncy11.
[15:20.700 --> 15:22.900]  Sends me a lot of great messages.
[15:22.900 --> 15:25.020]  We did talk about some other stuff
[15:25.020 --> 15:26.220]  and I replied why I don't do it.
[15:26.220 --> 15:29.460]  And he replied with good point, haters suck.
[15:29.460 --> 15:30.880]  That was part of a private conversation,
[15:30.880 --> 15:32.300]  but you're very correct, brother.
[15:32.300 --> 15:34.040]  Haters do suck.
[15:34.040 --> 15:35.620]  Shout out to all my haters out there.
[15:35.620 --> 15:37.860]  If you're watching this out of hatred, out of spite,
[15:37.860 --> 15:38.700]  I love you.
[15:38.700 --> 15:39.540]  I hope you're doing well.
[15:39.540 --> 15:40.940]  I hope you gain success
[15:40.940 --> 15:42.380]  and I hope you have a wonderful life.
[15:42.380 --> 15:45.060]  Hug a hater, send them on their way.
[15:45.060 --> 15:46.380]  Now this message goes,
[15:46.380 --> 15:49.660]  I do have a few ideas for episodes.
[15:49.660 --> 15:50.580]  I like that.
[15:50.580 --> 15:53.780]  This one says, I've got a two foot by four foot,
[15:53.780 --> 15:54.960]  not a two inch by four inch,
[15:54.960 --> 15:58.660]  but a two foot by four foot dry and cure tent.
[15:58.660 --> 16:00.860]  So they've taken a grow tent and they've modified it
[16:00.860 --> 16:03.260]  and set it up to be their drying space.
[16:03.260 --> 16:06.380]  They're drying their chopped down flowers in this tent.
[16:06.380 --> 16:11.060]  It says, I have now found that if you use a two by four tent
[16:11.060 --> 16:13.860]  with exhaust, you can exhaust with a duct fan
[16:13.860 --> 16:17.100]  into a four inch carbon filter for like five to 10 days.
[16:17.100 --> 16:19.540]  The plants are hanging down during this period.
[16:19.540 --> 16:21.260]  Then you can take them off the strings,
[16:21.260 --> 16:23.740]  use plastic bins and leave them in there.
[16:23.740 --> 16:25.860]  Just then take them off the strings,
[16:25.860 --> 16:28.660]  leave them just enough of a stem to trim with.
[16:28.660 --> 16:30.860]  Then let them sit in the same environment
[16:30.860 --> 16:32.320]  with the plastic bins on the ground
[16:32.320 --> 16:34.380]  for five to 10 more days.
[16:34.380 --> 16:35.660]  Then trim it and jar it.
[16:35.660 --> 16:38.900]  Burp for three weeks daily, leaving in the tent.
[16:38.900 --> 16:42.900]  This method has worked well and is simple and easy.
[16:42.900 --> 16:43.740]  That's a great idea.
[16:43.740 --> 16:45.620]  That is a great way to use a grow tent.
[16:45.620 --> 16:47.740]  A lot of us are growing in the grow tent
[16:47.740 --> 16:49.940]  and don't have a place to dry and cure.
[16:49.940 --> 16:52.100]  That tent that you grew in would be perfect.
[16:52.100 --> 16:53.700]  Just modify it a little bit.
[16:53.700 --> 16:56.340]  Don't turn on the light because we don't need the light.
[16:56.340 --> 16:58.420]  Just like our friend said, use an exhaust
[16:58.420 --> 17:00.940]  so that you're sucking out all that stale air.
[17:00.940 --> 17:02.820]  Use a carbon filter so you're not spreading
[17:02.820 --> 17:04.620]  that intense aroma around.
[17:04.620 --> 17:07.380]  Because once you harvest, the smell is fucking intense.
[17:07.380 --> 17:09.540]  Once you start rustling those trichomes around,
[17:09.540 --> 17:11.700]  moving the plants around, it really gets stinky.
[17:11.700 --> 17:14.260]  So you got your grow tent, you got your carbon filter,
[17:14.260 --> 17:15.180]  you got your blower in there,
[17:15.180 --> 17:16.340]  you're sucking out the stale air,
[17:16.340 --> 17:17.740]  you're bringing in fresh air.
[17:17.740 --> 17:19.020]  A little bit of air movement is good.
[17:19.020 --> 17:20.700]  Not ridiculous air movement in there.
[17:20.700 --> 17:22.300]  You don't want it blowing on those plants.
[17:22.300 --> 17:24.140]  But yeah, you've got the right idea.
[17:24.140 --> 17:26.620]  They're hanging upside down, which is ideal.
[17:26.620 --> 17:29.060]  Take them off the string, use clean plastic bins
[17:29.060 --> 17:31.020]  and leave just enough of a stem to trim with.
[17:31.020 --> 17:33.080]  That sounds ideal to me.
[17:33.080 --> 17:34.860]  Basically similar to what we would do
[17:34.860 --> 17:35.900]  in a commercial environment.
[17:35.900 --> 17:37.380]  I'll talk on that in a second.
[17:37.380 --> 17:39.140]  Let them sit in the same environment
[17:39.140 --> 17:40.700]  in the plastic bins on the ground.
[17:40.700 --> 17:42.940]  Yes, the only thing you're not doing
[17:42.940 --> 17:44.880]  that I do in a commercial environment
[17:44.880 --> 17:48.560]  is I put a humidifier and a dehumidifier in that room.
[17:48.560 --> 17:50.400]  I don't use a tent, I have a room
[17:50.400 --> 17:51.760]  with locks and cameras and shit.
[17:51.760 --> 17:56.280]  But I put a humidifier and dehumidifier in the same room
[17:56.280 --> 17:59.640]  and set them both at 50% and let them fucking fight.
[17:59.640 --> 18:02.700]  That way it is always 50% humidity in that room.
[18:02.700 --> 18:05.040]  If you can control the temperature,
[18:05.040 --> 18:06.200]  that would be ideal as well.
[18:06.200 --> 18:08.320]  I understand this is in your home,
[18:08.320 --> 18:10.880]  but it sounds like you're doing the right thing.
[18:10.880 --> 18:12.200]  Leave them for...
[18:12.200 --> 18:14.880]  So you've got them hanging for five to 10 days,
[18:14.880 --> 18:16.720]  on the ground for five to 10 more days.
[18:16.720 --> 18:18.800]  That's gonna be 14, 20-ish days.
[18:18.800 --> 18:20.960]  That's right around the right time period.
[18:20.960 --> 18:22.920]  Then trim it and jar it.
[18:22.920 --> 18:26.440]  Then burp three weeks daily, leaving in the tent.
[18:26.440 --> 18:28.040]  At this point, you could take them out of the tent
[18:28.040 --> 18:30.000]  if you wanted to, you put them on a shelf or whatever.
[18:30.000 --> 18:32.380]  But if you wanna leave them in the tent, that's cool.
[18:32.380 --> 18:35.100]  This method has worked well and is simple and easy.
[18:35.100 --> 18:36.120]  Yes, that's a great idea
[18:36.120 --> 18:39.640]  because a lot of people don't have dry and clear space.
[18:39.640 --> 18:40.620]  They did not plan for that.
[18:40.620 --> 18:41.600]  They did not prep for that.
[18:42.000 --> 18:42.840]  They don't know where they're gonna do it.
[18:42.840 --> 18:44.560]  So that tent is a great space.
[18:44.560 --> 18:46.040]  Why not just utilize that space?
[18:46.040 --> 18:48.640]  You've already paid rent, already bought the gear.
[18:48.640 --> 18:50.640]  It may slow you down two weeks on your next crop.
[18:50.640 --> 18:52.360]  But if you're not looking for production,
[18:52.360 --> 18:54.120]  if you're just running a small crop,
[18:54.120 --> 18:55.480]  that is a beautiful idea.
[18:55.480 --> 18:57.480]  CINCI11, thank you for the great idea.
[18:58.360 --> 18:59.440]  If you got any more questions, brother,
[18:59.440 --> 19:01.600]  I do look forward to hearing from you.
[19:01.600 --> 19:04.120]  Guys, use that space you've got, guys and gals.
[19:04.120 --> 19:05.120]  Use the space you've got.
[19:05.120 --> 19:06.960]  The only thing I would do differently,
[19:06.960 --> 19:09.360]  I would add that humidifier and dehumidifier.
[19:09.360 --> 19:11.320]  But you might be in just the right area
[19:12.000 --> 19:12.840]  to where you don't need to do that.
[19:12.840 --> 19:13.680]  I've got an area in my basement
[19:13.680 --> 19:15.240]  that is perfect for drying and curing plants.
[19:15.240 --> 19:16.800]  I don't have to add or subtract anything.
[19:16.800 --> 19:18.040]  The plants just fucking love it.
[19:18.040 --> 19:20.260]  So sometimes we get lucky.
[19:20.260 --> 19:21.720]  All right, I do have another question.
[19:21.720 --> 19:24.720]  This one says, if not bad genetics,
[19:24.720 --> 19:28.300]  what causes hermaphrodites or intersex traits?
[19:28.300 --> 19:31.160]  That is a very, very good question.
[19:31.160 --> 19:33.720]  Most of the time, if we see intersex traits in a plant,
[19:33.720 --> 19:35.600]  we immediately blame genetics.
[19:35.600 --> 19:37.160]  It's either genetics or grower, right?
[19:37.160 --> 19:39.600]  Those are the two things it could have been.
[19:39.600 --> 19:41.220]  But there's something we often overlook.
[19:41.940 --> 19:44.900]  My buddy James Bean calls it the Jurassic Park effect.
[19:44.900 --> 19:46.560]  And I completely agree with that.
[19:47.480 --> 19:52.180]  The bottom line is life finds a way.
[19:52.180 --> 19:53.600]  Cannabis is an annual plant
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.780]  that is designed to live for one season.
[19:55.780 --> 20:00.140]  It's supposed to veg, flower, produce seeds, die.
[20:00.140 --> 20:01.660]  The seeds grow next year.
[20:01.660 --> 20:03.860]  Annual plant, one season, one year.
[20:04.940 --> 20:08.100]  We have developed plants that don't produce pollen
[20:08.100 --> 20:09.660]  and don't produce any seeds
[20:09.660 --> 20:11.260]  because they are sensimilia plants.
[20:11.260 --> 20:13.740]  We've taken the males out of the equation.
[20:13.740 --> 20:16.100]  There's no seeds in the female plants.
[20:16.100 --> 20:17.580]  These plants know there's no seeds.
[20:17.580 --> 20:18.940]  They know they're not getting pollen.
[20:18.940 --> 20:22.420]  A female plant's whole goal in life is to get pollinated.
[20:22.420 --> 20:23.240]  That's all she wants.
[20:23.240 --> 20:26.940]  It's her sole purpose is to get pollinated and make seeds
[20:26.940 --> 20:30.220]  so that we can continue this generation
[20:30.220 --> 20:34.340]  or this seed line, whatever label you want to put on it,
[20:34.340 --> 20:36.580]  this brand of seeds can continue
[20:36.580 --> 20:38.700]  for generations and generations.
[20:38.700 --> 20:41.820]  The male plant's whole idea is to drop loads of pollen
[20:41.820 --> 20:44.340]  on those female plants to continue his bloodline.
[20:44.340 --> 20:46.140]  That's why the male plant gets taller.
[20:46.140 --> 20:47.620]  The pollen falls down.
[20:47.620 --> 20:48.780]  The female plants are lower.
[20:48.780 --> 20:49.740]  They receive the pollen.
[20:49.740 --> 20:50.820]  They make seeds.
[20:50.820 --> 20:52.020]  The season ends.
[20:52.020 --> 20:53.260]  They either get frozen.
[20:53.260 --> 20:54.460]  They fall to the ground and die.
[20:54.460 --> 20:55.460]  The wind drops them down.
[20:55.460 --> 20:57.940]  The birds eat them, shit out the seeds somewhere else.
[20:57.940 --> 20:59.820]  Seeds are scattered randomly, chaotically,
[20:59.820 --> 21:01.420]  just like pollen.
[21:01.420 --> 21:04.740]  So that's not happening in our grow rooms.
[21:04.740 --> 21:05.980]  That's just simply not happening.
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.820]  We don't have birds.
[21:06.820 --> 21:08.260]  We don't have bees.
[21:08.780 --> 21:10.340]  We don't have a lot of things happening in there.
[21:10.340 --> 21:11.180]  These plants, no.
[21:11.180 --> 21:13.740]  The female plants are like fucking horny.
[21:13.740 --> 21:15.700]  I've been in this room for this many weeks.
[21:15.700 --> 21:17.260]  I've been in flower.
[21:17.260 --> 21:19.380]  Around week three, I really should have got jizzed on
[21:19.380 --> 21:22.220]  and got filled up with seeds, but that didn't happen.
[21:22.220 --> 21:23.740]  I'm like nine weeks into flower.
[21:23.740 --> 21:24.980]  My trichomes are ripe.
[21:24.980 --> 21:26.300]  My leaves are weird.
[21:26.300 --> 21:27.340]  The season changed in here.
[21:27.340 --> 21:28.380]  He's got it nice and cold.
[21:28.380 --> 21:30.140]  He changed the fucking light cycle.
[21:30.140 --> 21:30.980]  I don't know what to do.
[21:30.980 --> 21:33.480]  I'm gonna die and I didn't get pollinated.
[21:33.480 --> 21:35.880]  So I'm not gonna get to make babies.
[21:35.880 --> 21:36.980]  Watch this.
[21:36.980 --> 21:39.020]  And so that plant just goes boink
[21:39.020 --> 21:42.420]  and it makes a fucking seed because life finds a way.
[21:42.420 --> 21:44.100]  Just like Jurassic Park, bro.
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.580]  They only had female plants,
[21:45.580 --> 21:47.380]  but, or they only had female dinosaurs,
[21:47.380 --> 21:50.780]  but somehow one of them female dinosaurs,
[21:50.780 --> 21:54.260]  some immaculate conception, some biblical shit happened
[21:54.260 --> 21:55.780]  and there are more dinosaurs.
[21:55.780 --> 21:57.780]  Cannabis plants work just like that.
[21:57.780 --> 22:00.240]  They will create their own seeds.
[22:00.240 --> 22:02.180]  They will create their own pollen.
[22:02.180 --> 22:04.660]  There are ways to make this happen also.
[22:04.660 --> 22:05.940]  What causes herms?
[22:05.980 --> 22:08.860]  So stress will do it.
[22:08.860 --> 22:10.260]  Bad genetics will do it.
[22:10.260 --> 22:13.740]  Overfeeding, underfeeding, terrible environment will do it,
[22:13.740 --> 22:17.020]  but letting it go way too long will also do it.
[22:17.020 --> 22:18.900]  If you let, if that plant should have been chopped down
[22:18.900 --> 22:21.260]  at week eight and you let it go to week 10 or 11,
[22:21.260 --> 22:23.500]  it will hermaphrodite on you.
[22:23.500 --> 22:26.240]  A lot of things can contribute to intersex traits
[22:26.240 --> 22:27.760]  and hermaphroditism.
[22:27.760 --> 22:29.660]  It should have been washed out in the breeding.
[22:29.660 --> 22:31.380]  It should have been selected better.
[22:31.380 --> 22:32.640]  That should have been,
[22:32.640 --> 22:34.660]  before we gave you seeds or spread them out,
[22:34.660 --> 22:36.320]  we should have realized there's a trait in there
[22:36.320 --> 22:39.620]  that needs to be bred out or the seeds need to be tossed.
[22:40.460 --> 22:43.740]  But any plant has the opportunity
[22:43.740 --> 22:46.000]  to show an intersex trait.
[22:46.000 --> 22:48.620]  It has got the will to survive.
[22:48.620 --> 22:50.060]  Life will find a way.
[22:50.060 --> 22:51.420]  And shout out to my buddy James Bean
[22:51.420 --> 22:53.580]  for coining that Jurassic Park term.
[22:53.580 --> 22:54.580]  I don't know if he made that up,
[22:54.580 --> 22:56.220]  but that is who I heard it from.
[22:56.220 --> 22:59.980]  Life will find a way, just like Jurassic Park.
[22:59.980 --> 23:02.580]  So if not bad genetics,
[23:02.580 --> 23:04.460]  what are some causes of hermaphrodites?
[23:05.260 --> 23:06.100]  The will to survive, bro,
[23:06.100 --> 23:08.300]  is the main cause for hermaphrodites.
[23:08.300 --> 23:10.940]  It's not just bad genetics, sometimes grower error.
[23:10.940 --> 23:13.140]  You have to keep in mind that a lot of the chem dog stuff,
[23:13.140 --> 23:17.420]  a lot of the OG stuff is prone to being hermaphroditic,
[23:17.420 --> 23:18.600]  to showing intersex traits.
[23:18.600 --> 23:21.200]  It's up to us to not give it the opportunity.
[23:21.200 --> 23:23.700]  We know that certain things in the room will trigger that.
[23:23.700 --> 23:26.500]  Overfeeding it, underfeeding it, too much cold,
[23:26.500 --> 23:28.920]  drastic temperature swings, shit like that.
[23:28.920 --> 23:31.540]  Stress at all will cause a chem 91
[23:31.580 --> 23:34.820]  or a real old school OG kush plant to just go herm on you.
[23:34.820 --> 23:37.860]  Overwatering it, overwatering an OG kush plant
[23:37.860 --> 23:39.860]  can cause it to turn into an intersex plant.
[23:39.860 --> 23:41.460]  It already was intersex.
[23:41.460 --> 23:44.060]  It'll cause it to show the intersex trait.
[23:44.060 --> 23:45.900]  So a lot of things can trigger that.
[23:45.900 --> 23:48.220]  You can grow a plant several, several times,
[23:48.220 --> 23:50.600]  and just one new thing can really piss it off
[23:50.600 --> 23:54.020]  and make it display that intersex trait for you.
[23:54.020 --> 23:55.740]  All right, I've got one more great message.
[23:55.740 --> 23:56.900]  This is a good one.
[23:56.900 --> 23:57.980]  It's kind of a long message.
[23:57.980 --> 24:00.780]  I'm going to cut to the chase once I start reading it.
[24:00.780 --> 24:04.440]  I don't know if they want their name said because I do.
[24:04.440 --> 24:05.300]  You'll understand why.
[24:05.300 --> 24:07.600]  It says, I hope this finds you well.
[24:07.600 --> 24:10.060]  I've had issues maintaining a constant temperature
[24:10.060 --> 24:12.420]  and keeping humidity up in my tents.
[24:12.420 --> 24:13.980]  I will set the stage for you
[24:13.980 --> 24:16.140]  to better help you wrap your head around this problem.
[24:16.140 --> 24:17.540]  I like that approach.
[24:17.540 --> 24:20.480]  I will end with the steps I plan on taking to look forward.
[24:21.580 --> 24:23.760]  I will end with the steps I plan on taking,
[24:23.760 --> 24:27.300]  and I look forward to hearing from your expertise.
[24:27.300 --> 24:29.340]  So this is a great way to set up an email.
[24:29.420 --> 24:32.020]  It says, I have two tents in a room
[24:32.020 --> 24:33.460]  that is as sealed as can be
[24:33.460 --> 24:36.260]  while maintaining an inconspicuous outside view.
[24:36.260 --> 24:38.000]  That's fucking understandable.
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.900]  In my veg tent, I have two LEDs,
[24:39.900 --> 24:42.200]  and then we talk a little bit about the grow.
[24:42.200 --> 24:45.220]  Then we come to the main problem of the grow.
[24:45.220 --> 24:48.580]  The room itself has temperature fluctuations.
[24:49.420 --> 24:52.860]  We can't get the room much lower than 83 degrees.
[24:52.860 --> 24:55.220]  I have taken more of a MacGyver approach for this problem,
[24:55.220 --> 24:58.020]  and I would like to avoid bringing in AC units,
[24:58.020 --> 24:59.780]  expensive regulators, and so on,
[24:59.780 --> 25:03.300]  but if that's what it has to be, then so be it.
[25:03.300 --> 25:04.940]  It says, so far, my steps have been
[25:04.940 --> 25:07.960]  placing buckets of water with an air pump in stone
[25:07.960 --> 25:09.640]  in the tents.
[25:09.640 --> 25:10.700]  That's not gonna make it cool.
[25:10.700 --> 25:11.900]  You need cool.
[25:11.900 --> 25:13.220]  It says, I moved my flower tent
[25:13.220 --> 25:14.520]  to the coldest part of the room,
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.620]  away from the basic radiator to maintain minimum heat,
[25:18.620 --> 25:20.300]  which it obviously didn't work.
[25:20.300 --> 25:21.620]  Then it says, I'm a brand new grower,
[25:21.620 --> 25:24.860]  and I've listened to your collection of grow tips four times,
[25:24.860 --> 25:26.020]  and I would like to have a nice setup
[25:26.020 --> 25:27.460]  before I start my new seeds.
[25:27.900 --> 25:31.140]  Any criticism is appreciated and keep it up.
[25:33.860 --> 25:36.500]  So I had a lot to say about this message,
[25:36.500 --> 25:38.220]  and then I just cut right to the chase.
[25:38.220 --> 25:41.220]  I was like, bro, you can do all kinds of magic.
[25:41.220 --> 25:42.100]  You can hope and pray.
[25:42.100 --> 25:43.180]  You can move shit around.
[25:43.180 --> 25:45.700]  The answer is buy an air conditioner.
[25:45.700 --> 25:47.580]  Why are you dodging an air conditioner?
[25:47.580 --> 25:49.660]  You can make this job as hard as you want.
[25:49.660 --> 25:51.220]  You can make this grow as challenging
[25:51.220 --> 25:54.200]  as you want on yourself, or you already said it.
[25:54.200 --> 25:55.180]  I could buy an air conditioner.
[25:55.180 --> 25:56.660]  You've already brought buckets into the room
[25:56.660 --> 25:58.540]  and put bubblers and shit in there.
[25:58.540 --> 25:59.740]  You're moving things around.
[25:59.740 --> 26:01.680]  You're trying to do MacGyver tricks.
[26:01.680 --> 26:04.860]  Why not go to the store and buy the air conditioner
[26:04.860 --> 26:05.820]  and install the AC?
[26:05.820 --> 26:10.100]  So I said, buy the air conditioner, bro.
[26:10.100 --> 26:11.160]  And then he said, and update,
[26:11.160 --> 26:14.940]  I buckled and got a regular AC unit.
[26:14.940 --> 26:16.780]  And I said, sorry for the slow reply,
[26:16.780 --> 26:18.620]  but you have made the correct move.
[26:18.620 --> 26:20.720]  Sometimes in a grow environment,
[26:20.720 --> 26:22.220]  you have just got to bite the bullet
[26:22.220 --> 26:23.340]  and get the correct gear.
[26:23.340 --> 26:25.920]  You can try to MacGyver stuff.
[26:25.920 --> 26:27.420]  You can duct tape stuff.
[26:27.420 --> 26:29.640]  You can rig stuff up however you want,
[26:29.640 --> 26:31.680]  but every bud you grow,
[26:31.680 --> 26:35.640]  every half-ass, larfy, fluffy nugget that you produce
[26:35.640 --> 26:37.960]  is going to show that your grow room
[26:37.960 --> 26:39.720]  was not what it could have been.
[26:39.720 --> 26:41.040]  You know your flaw.
[26:41.040 --> 26:42.800]  You know your weakest link.
[26:42.800 --> 26:44.440]  Why are you gonna let that weak link,
[26:44.440 --> 26:45.800]  that chink in the armor,
[26:45.800 --> 26:48.480]  the fucking, the weak part be the weak part?
[26:48.480 --> 26:49.400]  You know it.
[26:49.400 --> 26:51.220]  That's, fix that.
[26:51.220 --> 26:52.400]  You did, you did.
[26:52.400 --> 26:53.240]  You stepped up.
[26:53.240 --> 26:54.060]  And I'm just saying,
[26:54.060 --> 26:55.980]  to everybody out there who's thinking like this,
[26:55.980 --> 26:56.840]  it is springtime.
[26:56.840 --> 26:58.680]  It's about to go into summertime.
[26:58.680 --> 26:59.960]  It's not the time to be cheap.
[26:59.960 --> 27:02.140]  Now is the time to get the dehumidifier you need,
[27:02.140 --> 27:03.620]  the air conditioner you need,
[27:03.620 --> 27:05.500]  get that room dialed in properly.
[27:05.500 --> 27:06.480]  You're growing medicine.
[27:06.480 --> 27:07.820]  You're growing a product.
[27:07.820 --> 27:09.140]  You want high quality.
[27:10.080 --> 27:11.180]  When I worked at Guitar Center,
[27:11.180 --> 27:13.380]  I used this to explain things to customers.
[27:13.380 --> 27:15.780]  You could buy a cheap-ass guitar if you want,
[27:15.780 --> 27:17.380]  but it's gonna hurt the kid's fingers.
[27:17.380 --> 27:18.420]  It's gonna sound like shit.
[27:18.420 --> 27:20.440]  It's never going to be fun to play.
[27:20.440 --> 27:22.260]  You're never gonna sound like Metallica
[27:22.260 --> 27:24.020]  on that shit-ass guitar.
[27:24.860 --> 27:27.320]  You could step it up and not buy the lowest level.
[27:27.320 --> 27:29.060]  You could buy, at Guitar Center,
[27:29.060 --> 27:30.340]  it goes good, better, best.
[27:30.340 --> 27:31.580]  You could buy better.
[27:31.580 --> 27:33.100]  You could buy the medium range guitar
[27:33.100 --> 27:35.580]  where it doesn't kill your fingers every time you play,
[27:35.580 --> 27:37.580]  and it's got potential to have good tone.
[27:37.580 --> 27:39.100]  It's not gonna fall apart.
[27:39.100 --> 27:40.400]  It's not gonna come out of tune
[27:40.400 --> 27:42.240]  every time you hit the fucking strings.
[27:42.240 --> 27:43.080]  Get the better.
[27:43.080 --> 27:45.300]  Don't get the shitty one, the good one.
[27:45.300 --> 27:48.580]  Get the better one so that you actually enjoy growing.
[27:48.580 --> 27:50.940]  Your goal here is to produce a product,
[27:50.940 --> 27:53.880]  but also growing can be very therapeutic.
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.720]  For me, being in the grow room, I don't answer the phone.
[27:56.720 --> 27:59.920]  If I'm in the grow room and anybody calls,
[27:59.920 --> 28:01.120]  maybe if the daughter calls,
[28:01.120 --> 28:02.360]  because my daughter might need something,
[28:02.360 --> 28:03.180]  I'll answer for her.
[28:03.180 --> 28:06.080]  Anybody else, the girlfriend, the company,
[28:06.080 --> 28:09.280]  the banker, the accountant, I don't answer for them.
[28:09.280 --> 28:10.180]  I'm in the garden, dude.
[28:10.180 --> 28:11.580]  That is my zen space.
[28:11.580 --> 28:12.880]  That is my moment.
[28:12.880 --> 28:13.720]  That is my area.
[28:13.720 --> 28:15.340]  You can't fuck with me.
[28:15.340 --> 28:16.760]  And if I just cheap-assed it
[28:16.760 --> 28:19.160]  and used a shitty half-assed piece of gear in there,
[28:19.160 --> 28:20.840]  I wouldn't have any pride in it,
[28:20.840 --> 28:22.960]  and it wouldn't feel zen when I was in there.
[28:22.960 --> 28:24.280]  So put a lot of pride into it.
[28:24.280 --> 28:26.540]  And also understand that this is a budget issue
[28:26.540 --> 28:27.660]  for a lot of people.
[28:27.660 --> 28:29.280]  But don't cheap out.
[28:29.280 --> 28:31.000]  You're buying other things, I betcha.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.880]  Like maybe just don't buy that PlayStation game
[28:33.880 --> 28:34.840]  or that Xbox game.
[28:34.840 --> 28:35.680]  Did I fucking say that?
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.520]  That's like me saying,
[28:36.520 --> 28:38.080]  don't buy that one pair of sneakers
[28:38.080 --> 28:39.560]  so that you can buy that air conditioner.
[28:39.560 --> 28:40.380]  But you know what?
[28:40.380 --> 28:41.440]  I'm buying the sneakers now
[28:41.440 --> 28:44.120]  because I bought all the air conditioners already
[28:44.120 --> 28:46.080]  and they're running and the rooms are working.
[28:46.080 --> 28:49.000]  So I know things are where they need to be.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.920]  And in turn, the business is working.
[28:50.920 --> 28:52.480]  So since I put the money in,
[28:52.480 --> 28:53.400]  there's money coming out.
[28:53.400 --> 28:54.500]  I can buy the sneakers now.
[28:54.500 --> 28:55.740]  You gotta put the money in
[28:55.740 --> 28:57.000]  to get the product out you want.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.600]  My point is, if you're gonna do this shit,
[28:59.600 --> 29:00.800]  have pride in it.
[29:00.800 --> 29:02.640]  Have 100% pride.
[29:02.640 --> 29:04.400]  If you go in there and you just half-ass it
[29:04.400 --> 29:05.240]  and the product comes out
[29:05.240 --> 29:06.960]  and you half-ass it when you smoke it,
[29:06.960 --> 29:08.200]  it'll be a half-assed product.
[29:08.200 --> 29:10.100]  You'll have half-assed pride in it.
[29:10.100 --> 29:11.960]  Anything that you grow and you smoke
[29:11.960 --> 29:13.480]  and you consume that you put pride into,
[29:13.480 --> 29:14.860]  you're gonna feel a better buzz,
[29:14.860 --> 29:16.520]  more pride when you consume it.
[29:16.520 --> 29:17.760]  So put pride in there.
[29:17.760 --> 29:19.960]  We've talked about this on a previous episode.
[29:19.960 --> 29:21.160]  A lot of you are growing,
[29:21.160 --> 29:23.720]  allegedly, maybe, potentially, possibly,
[29:23.720 --> 29:25.320]  in an illegal place.
[29:25.320 --> 29:27.240]  If you're gonna do it, fucking do it.
[29:27.240 --> 29:29.040]  Like, don't go in there and just half-ass it.
[29:29.040 --> 29:30.480]  Have pride in it.
[29:30.480 --> 29:31.560]  Felonies aren't free.
[29:31.560 --> 29:34.320]  Don't commit that crime to fucking just be doing it.
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.000]  Commit that fucking felony to when?
[29:37.000 --> 29:39.880]  Like, if you're gonna go in, fucking go in, dude.
[29:39.880 --> 29:42.300]  All right, I feel like I rambled for a long time.
[29:42.300 --> 29:43.320]  I've got another messenger,
[29:43.320 --> 29:44.660]  but I think we should save this one
[29:44.660 --> 29:46.240]  because I've been going for a long time
[29:46.240 --> 29:48.660]  and the throat is nice and dry.
[29:48.660 --> 29:51.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps, hoes,
[29:51.880 --> 29:53.880]  friends, bows, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
[29:53.880 --> 29:55.760]  pollen chuckers, I wanna thank you again
[29:55.760 --> 29:57.040]  for listening to another episode

[30:08.640 --> 30:10.900]  Big shout out to Crazy Hands for supporting the show.
[30:10.900 --> 30:12.120]  Also, big shout out to my friends,
[30:12.120 --> 30:14.200]  Stoney, like Baloney, and Kurt Z
[30:14.200 --> 30:15.800]  for being huge supporters of the show.
[30:15.800 --> 30:19.220]  Without guys like EZ057 and Aldridge,
[30:19.220 --> 30:20.700]  this show wouldn't be what it is.
[30:21.360 --> 30:22.740]  I'm trying to sneak in more Patreon shout outs
[30:22.740 --> 30:24.500]  because they are overloaded.
[30:24.500 --> 30:26.140]  I've got a lot of them that I'm due.
[30:26.140 --> 30:27.260]  I need to do more episodes,
[30:27.260 --> 30:28.620]  put more shout outs in the episodes,
[30:28.620 --> 30:31.220]  but gotta sneak them in there where it is smooth.
[30:31.220 --> 30:32.640]  If you feel like the episode was educational,

[30:59.840 --> 31:02.000]  I don't know if I gave you the email address before.

[31:18.480 --> 31:19.800]  Check it out.
[31:19.800 --> 31:21.400]  I think that's all I've got for you.

[31:23.400 --> 31:25.520]  This was a sloppy ass ending, but it was natural,
[31:25.520 --> 31:27.840]  and sometimes that's how it goes.
[31:27.840 --> 31:29.160]  Thank you guys for listening.
[31:29.160 --> 31:31.240]  I look forward to joining you in just a few days.
[31:31.240 --> 31:34.280]  I wanna give a giant shout out to my buddy OG Purple Thumb,
[31:34.280 --> 31:36.600]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[31:36.600 --> 31:38.200]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:38.200 --> 31:45.030]  Boom, boom, boom.
[31:45.030 --> 31:46.350]  Boom, boom, boom.
