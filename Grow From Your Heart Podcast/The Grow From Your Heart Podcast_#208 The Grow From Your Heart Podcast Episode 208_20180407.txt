[00:01.920 --> 00:03.800]  What's up, Podcast World?
[00:03.800 --> 00:08.400]  It's Rasta Jeff, and it's time for episode number 208 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:08.400 --> 00:11.160]  It's Thursday, so I'm posting a throwback Thursday episode.
[00:11.160 --> 00:17.340]  I am posting episodes 39, 40, and 41 of what used to be the iGrowCulture Podcast, now known
[00:17.340 --> 00:19.340]  as the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:19.340 --> 00:23.440]  Before we get to these old episodes, let me make a couple of updates and disclaimers.
[00:23.440 --> 00:25.080]  All of the social media has changed.
[00:25.080 --> 00:28.460]  The new email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[00:28.460 --> 00:33.420]  The Twitter is at GFYH Podcast, and on Facebook, you can just search for the Grow From Your
[00:33.420 --> 00:34.420]  Heart Podcast.
[00:34.420 --> 00:37.420]  I would love it if you stalk me on all of the social media.
[00:37.420 --> 00:41.980]  Also, there may be some advertisements and promotions for old products and old sponsors.
[00:41.980 --> 00:43.540]  All of those have expired.
[00:43.540 --> 00:45.180]  I currently do not have any sponsors.
[00:45.180 --> 00:49.540]  I do not have any advertising, so any ads or anything that may be said in this episode,
[00:49.540 --> 00:50.980]  those expired a long time ago.
[00:50.980 --> 00:52.700]  I do apologize.
[00:52.700 --> 00:56.140]  But there will be a lot of great content in these episodes, so without any more rambles,
[00:56.140 --> 01:01.980]  ladies and gentlemen, let's get to episodes 39, 40, and 41 of what used to be the iGrowCulture
[01:01.980 --> 01:04.780]  Podcast, currently known as the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:04.780 --> 01:07.140]  All right, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:07.140 --> 01:10.980]  You have no idea what just happened at this table right now, but I wish I would have hit
[01:10.980 --> 01:13.500]  record about five minutes ago, because some of that shit was priceless.
[01:13.500 --> 01:16.140]  Guys, welcome to episode number 39 of the iGrowCulture Podcast.
[01:16.140 --> 01:17.140]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[01:17.140 --> 01:18.140]  Guess who I got back at the table, guys?
[01:18.140 --> 01:19.140]  Jesse's here.
[01:19.140 --> 01:20.140]  How you doing, brother?
[01:20.140 --> 01:21.140]  Hey, what's up, podcast land?
[01:21.140 --> 01:22.140]  Dude, you sound great on that microphone.
[01:22.140 --> 01:23.140]  We made a couple of tech adjustments.
[01:24.140 --> 01:25.140]  Sounds like I poured some Super Thrive into the mixing gear here.
[01:25.140 --> 01:26.140]  We got it going on.
[01:26.140 --> 01:27.140]  Adjusted the timing a little.
[01:27.140 --> 01:28.140]  Yes, we got a new muffler bearing in there.
[01:28.140 --> 01:29.140]  It's running quite smooth.
[01:29.140 --> 01:30.140]  So, a couple episodes, we talked about building a grow room, and I got Jesse to come back
[01:30.140 --> 01:31.140]  and kind of wrap that up a little more for us, which, ironically, he might have been
[01:31.140 --> 01:32.140]  working in a grow space.
[01:32.140 --> 01:33.140]  Yeah.
[01:33.140 --> 01:34.140]  Did you learn anything?
[01:34.140 --> 01:35.140]  150-year-old houses are 150-year-old houses.
[01:35.140 --> 01:36.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:36.140 --> 01:37.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:37.140 --> 01:38.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:38.140 --> 01:39.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:39.140 --> 01:40.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:40.140 --> 01:41.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:41.140 --> 01:42.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:42.140 --> 01:43.140]  I'm not sure what that means.
[01:44.140 --> 01:45.140]  year older houses.
[01:45.140 --> 01:48.020]  Is it brick or is it like drywall and shit?
[01:48.020 --> 01:49.020]  It's brick.
[01:49.020 --> 01:50.020]  Oh, that's no fun.
[01:50.020 --> 01:51.020]  Yeah.
[01:51.020 --> 01:52.020]  Everything's brick.
[01:52.020 --> 01:52.860]  Guys, that's going to definitely come in handy in the talk later, because I wrote some shit.
[01:52.860 --> 01:57.940]  And it's all about building a room inside of a room, and we're going to need to do that
[01:57.940 --> 01:58.760]  in Jesse's space it sounds like.
[01:58.760 --> 02:02.640]  But before we get to that part, let's pay some bills.
[02:02.640 --> 02:05.480]  I wrote some shit and it's all about building a room
[02:05.480 --> 02:07.440]  inside of a room and we're gonna need to do that
[02:07.440 --> 02:09.640]  in Jesse space it sounds like.
[02:09.640 --> 02:12.200]  But before we get to that part, let's pay some bills.
[02:12.200 --> 02:14.120]  This podcast is brought to you by our good friends
[02:14.120 --> 02:15.960]  at Cannabis Grand Crew.

[02:27.080 --> 02:28.840]  I'm glad you asked.

[05:03.720 --> 05:05.080]  It looks sweet in there.
[05:05.080 --> 05:06.040]  I use OGT.
[05:06.040 --> 05:08.240]  They just got some OGT in there.
[05:08.240 --> 05:09.200]  They're killing it.
[05:09.200 --> 05:11.040]  You guys have Hygrozyme on the shelf yet?
[05:11.040 --> 05:11.880]  Yeah.
[05:11.880 --> 05:13.720]  See, I ordered that once and now they've got it
[05:13.720 --> 05:15.360]  on the shelf for me all the time.
[05:15.360 --> 05:16.200]  Heck yeah.
[05:16.200 --> 05:17.040]  Loving it.
[05:17.040 --> 05:22.040]  We also have a big old bag of Roots 707 for $25 this month.
[05:22.160 --> 05:24.880]  That's a steal and I might need to go stock up on that.
[05:24.880 --> 05:26.900]  That space right there along that wall that's empty,
[05:26.900 --> 05:29.060]  we can just fill that right up with soil.
[05:29.060 --> 05:32.700]  And also this month, if you mention agriculture,
[05:32.700 --> 05:35.860]  you get commercial pricing on everything.
[05:35.860 --> 05:37.300]  That's the month of November?
[05:37.300 --> 05:38.120]  Yeah.
[05:38.120 --> 05:38.960]  You hear that guys?
[05:38.960 --> 05:40.100]  All the month of November,
[05:40.100 --> 05:42.060]  go to Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies in Pueblo.
[05:42.060 --> 05:42.900]  When you're paying,
[05:42.900 --> 05:44.460]  tell them I listened to the Agriculture Podcast.
[05:44.460 --> 05:46.300]  You will get commercial pricing.
[05:46.300 --> 05:48.100]  You're gonna pay what Rasta Jeff pays.
[05:48.100 --> 05:50.760]  You can get that in Denver too.
[05:52.420 --> 05:53.900]  They may have to make a phone call.
[05:53.900 --> 05:55.500]  Tell them to call.
[05:55.500 --> 05:57.340]  Tell them to call Jesse or Burn in Pueblo.
[05:57.340 --> 05:58.180]  And they'll get you straight down.
[05:58.180 --> 05:59.000]  They'll explain it all.
[05:59.000 --> 05:59.840]  Yeah.
[05:59.840 --> 06:00.660]  Yeah.
[06:00.660 --> 06:01.500]  Right on guys.
[06:01.500 --> 06:02.340]  Thank you.
[06:02.340 --> 06:03.160]  I didn't even know that was gonna happen.
[06:03.160 --> 06:04.060]  So I just learned about that at the same time
[06:04.060 --> 06:04.900]  the listeners did.
[06:04.900 --> 06:05.860]  That is really cool.
[06:05.860 --> 06:07.700]  If we have a good response,
[06:07.700 --> 06:09.300]  we'll just probably keep it that way.
[06:09.300 --> 06:10.140]  There we go.
[06:10.140 --> 06:11.540]  Guys go in there and use that coupon code
[06:11.540 --> 06:14.060]  or that discount code so that we can keep it going.
[06:14.060 --> 06:14.900]  The more of you that use it,
[06:14.900 --> 06:15.900]  they'll see the response.
[06:15.900 --> 06:17.220]  They'll keep doing it.
[06:17.220 --> 06:18.060]  Awesome.
[06:18.060 --> 06:19.660]  Thank you guys for listening and going there.
[06:19.660 --> 06:20.500]  We got one more ad.

[06:29.620 --> 06:31.300]  news and reviews.
[06:31.300 --> 06:35.380]  www.treethugger.com.
[06:35.380 --> 06:37.300]  I think I actually just confirmed
[06:37.300 --> 06:39.020]  that I'm gonna check out the string cheese incident
[06:39.020 --> 06:40.220]  in Denver on New Year's Eve.
[06:40.220 --> 06:41.140]  That's gonna be kind of cool.
[06:41.140 --> 06:42.020]  Kind of random for me.
[06:42.020 --> 06:44.260]  I haven't seen the cheese in years.
[06:44.260 --> 06:47.500]  Got a friend who needs a cheese buddy for New Year's.
[06:47.500 --> 06:49.420]  And I think I'm gonna be the cheese buddy.
[06:49.420 --> 06:50.500]  Quite a cheesy buddy.
[06:50.500 --> 06:52.100]  I think that's enough ads for the show.
[06:52.100 --> 06:53.480]  I think that covered everybody.
[06:54.000 --> 06:55.400]  Also check out naturesgreenremedies.com.
[06:55.400 --> 06:56.840]  I didn't do a big ad for them.
[06:56.840 --> 06:59.040]  They are sold out of iRegenetics products right now,
[06:59.040 --> 07:00.880]  but you can get Gage Green Genetics,
[07:00.880 --> 07:02.640]  La Plata Labs and Sin City.
[07:02.640 --> 07:04.800]  I do not have a coupon code for them this month.
[07:04.800 --> 07:07.320]  Once I give them a refill, they'll get a sweet coupon code.
[07:07.320 --> 07:09.400]  You guys will get hooked up.
[07:09.400 --> 07:11.040]  So currently what's been going on.
[07:11.040 --> 07:13.280]  We had an election last night.
[07:13.280 --> 07:16.360]  Colorado did not have much cannabis initiative
[07:16.360 --> 07:20.880]  on the ballots, but we did have number 105
[07:20.880 --> 07:23.040]  regarding non-GMO food.
[07:23.560 --> 07:25.520]  This was the labeling of GMO foods.
[07:25.520 --> 07:28.680]  Colorado, dude, you failed, bro.
[07:28.680 --> 07:29.520]  What the hell?
[07:29.520 --> 07:30.880]  This was supposed to pass.
[07:30.880 --> 07:34.020]  This was, we're not gonna get too much into it
[07:34.020 --> 07:35.280]  because it's already happened.
[07:35.280 --> 07:38.160]  This was, we wanted them to have to mark
[07:38.160 --> 07:39.800]  genetically modified food products
[07:39.800 --> 07:41.140]  with some sort of indication
[07:41.140 --> 07:42.740]  that it is genetically modified.
[07:43.760 --> 07:45.280]  Enriched with GMOs.
[07:45.280 --> 07:46.800]  We did not pass this.
[07:46.800 --> 07:48.940]  What the hell is going on, Colorado?
[07:50.640 --> 07:51.720]  All right.
[07:51.720 --> 07:52.960]  And it failed by landslide.
[07:52.960 --> 07:54.520]  That's the really disappointing part.
[07:54.520 --> 07:56.880]  I liked your, Jesse brought a really good Facebook post.
[07:56.880 --> 07:58.240]  He said something to the effect of,
[07:58.240 --> 07:59.360]  that's okay, Colorado.
[07:59.360 --> 08:02.800]  I didn't wanna share my organic produce with you anyway.
[08:02.800 --> 08:04.880]  Jesse's tomatoes are delicious.
[08:04.880 --> 08:05.720]  I am addicted.
[08:05.720 --> 08:07.440]  There's only one other place I've eaten recently
[08:07.440 --> 08:10.440]  that's got tomatoes nearly as tasty as Jesse's.
[08:10.440 --> 08:11.600]  I know where that place is.
[08:11.600 --> 08:13.320]  Dude, they get so many shout outs on this podcast.
[08:13.320 --> 08:14.400]  I'm addicted to that place.
[08:14.400 --> 08:16.000]  I eat there a lot.
[08:16.000 --> 08:19.840]  We went up there with Burn and Burn's cousin
[08:19.840 --> 08:22.400]  and they made customers.
[08:22.400 --> 08:23.240]  Yeah.
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.200]  Yeah, and they made friends.
[08:24.200 --> 08:25.040]  Yeah.
[08:25.040 --> 08:26.080]  They treat you like your family when you're there.
[08:26.080 --> 08:27.000]  They know my name by now.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.120]  They start writing down my order when they see me in line.
[08:29.120 --> 08:30.320]  They're like, you want the same thing, dude?
[08:30.320 --> 08:31.760]  And I'm like, yep.
[08:31.760 --> 08:32.600]  Yeah.
[08:32.600 --> 08:37.600]  It's, I've never seen that many Mare different drinks.
[08:38.240 --> 08:39.080]  Yeah.
[08:39.080 --> 08:42.160]  So like I was a little overwhelmed at first.
[08:42.160 --> 08:43.200]  It is, it's a little strange.
[08:43.200 --> 08:44.040]  The first time you walk in,
[08:44.040 --> 08:45.960]  well, the vibe there is very unique.
[08:45.960 --> 08:48.280]  So when you walk in, you're almost in a new world.
[08:48.280 --> 08:51.080]  Turn your cell phone off when you go in there, please.
[08:51.080 --> 08:53.520]  I agree, but there are so many people in there.
[08:53.520 --> 08:55.960]  I go, I've gone late at night and midday.
[08:55.960 --> 08:56.800]  And if you go during the day,
[08:56.800 --> 08:59.640]  it's like a 20 somethings with their Mac books
[08:59.640 --> 09:01.720]  and their iPhones all over the place.
[09:01.720 --> 09:03.880]  But you're right around, around 11 or 12.
[09:03.880 --> 09:05.880]  I wish we could get everyone to put their phones away
[09:05.880 --> 09:06.720]  and chill out.
[09:06.720 --> 09:07.560]  Cause it's really chill in there.
[09:07.560 --> 09:09.200]  There were some people playing chess
[09:09.200 --> 09:11.440]  and a couple of people who looked like
[09:11.440 --> 09:12.280]  they were on a date or something.
[09:12.280 --> 09:13.720]  It was just real chill.
[09:13.720 --> 09:16.280]  The guys playing chess in there look like robots.
[09:16.280 --> 09:18.120]  They're so good at chess, dude.
[09:18.960 --> 09:21.680]  The one guy, I swear he was playing chess
[09:21.680 --> 09:23.200]  with the guy in front of him.
[09:23.200 --> 09:25.400]  And then he was also playing it on his iPad.
[09:27.400 --> 09:28.760]  Is predicting what could happen.
[09:28.760 --> 09:29.840]  Or something, yeah.
[09:29.840 --> 09:31.680]  I was like, man.
[09:31.680 --> 09:32.920]  So I've got a funny joke
[09:32.920 --> 09:34.560]  that only a few listeners are going to get.
[09:34.560 --> 09:36.400]  We were at, we're talking about a place
[09:36.400 --> 09:38.480]  called the Mate Factor and they make Yerba Mate.
[09:38.480 --> 09:41.160]  It's a Brazilian energizing tea.
[09:41.160 --> 09:42.120]  They have two different kinds.
[09:42.120 --> 09:45.240]  They have the dark Yerba Mate, which is what I prefer.
[09:45.240 --> 09:48.280]  And then they have got the green Yerba Mate,
[09:48.280 --> 09:51.920]  which I prefer the green iced and I like the dark hot.
[09:51.920 --> 09:52.840]  That's just my preference.
[09:52.840 --> 09:55.200]  So if I need a cool drink, I'll get the green one.
[09:55.200 --> 09:58.480]  The guy was describing the differences to a customer
[09:58.480 --> 09:59.960]  who it's in a really touristy area.
[09:59.960 --> 10:01.640]  So you get a lot of touristy kind of people
[10:01.640 --> 10:03.580]  that are describing this drink to a tourist.
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.400]  And he said that the dark roast is the dried leaves
[10:06.400 --> 10:08.880]  that have been sat out and they've dried and they crumble it
[10:08.880 --> 10:10.120]  and then they brew it or they grind it
[10:10.120 --> 10:11.480]  and then they brew it together.
[10:11.480 --> 10:13.760]  And he said, the green is more the fresh leaf
[10:13.760 --> 10:16.640]  that hasn't been dried and set out for as long.
[10:16.640 --> 10:18.360]  And I heard him say that and I looked at the girl
[10:18.360 --> 10:19.280]  that was with me and I said,
[10:19.280 --> 10:21.040]  he's talking about that live res.
[10:21.040 --> 10:21.880]  Yeah.
[10:21.880 --> 10:22.720]  Nice.
[10:24.840 --> 10:26.520]  Only a few listeners are gonna laugh at that,
[10:26.520 --> 10:29.840]  but that's exactly the description that worked perfectly.
[10:29.840 --> 10:31.720]  It's all about that live resin.
[10:31.720 --> 10:33.640]  The dark roast is the dried and cured
[10:33.640 --> 10:35.880]  and then the fresh green is the live res.
[10:35.880 --> 10:36.920]  And you can taste the difference.
[10:36.920 --> 10:39.400]  It's such a huge difference.
[10:39.400 --> 10:42.440]  I had only ever had the green before I went up there
[10:42.440 --> 10:45.720]  and I got the dark and was like, yeah, this is the shit.
[10:45.720 --> 10:46.560]  All right.
[10:46.560 --> 10:47.440]  They don't know that this is gonna happen,
[10:47.440 --> 10:49.480]  but if anybody that listens to this podcast
[10:49.480 --> 10:52.480]  goes to the Mate Factor in Manitou Springs,
[10:52.480 --> 10:54.120]  say something about, you heard about,
[10:54.120 --> 10:56.920]  say I heard about this place from the I Grow Culture podcast
[10:56.920 --> 10:58.680]  and they told me to say hi.
[10:58.680 --> 10:59.920]  And then maybe they'll catch on
[10:59.920 --> 11:00.760]  because they know who I am.
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.840]  I've said that I'm the host of a show.
[11:02.840 --> 11:03.680]  Nice.
[11:03.680 --> 11:04.520]  Yeah.
[11:04.520 --> 11:05.600]  So maybe one day they'll,
[11:05.600 --> 11:08.440]  maybe I just want a free veggie wrap out of the deal.
[11:08.440 --> 11:09.880]  I got a free muffin from them the other night.
[11:09.880 --> 11:12.720]  They were really kind to give me a fresh, warm, free muffin.
[11:12.720 --> 11:13.560]  All right.
[11:13.560 --> 11:15.360]  That's a lot of talk about the Mate Factor.
[11:15.360 --> 11:17.040]  That place is so good, bro.
[11:17.040 --> 11:19.480]  If you go up there, go hike on Rainbow Falls.
[11:19.480 --> 11:21.440]  I never said nothing about the secret Rainbow Falls.
[11:21.440 --> 11:22.280]  That place is awesome.
[11:22.280 --> 11:23.280]  If you can find it, go hike it.
[11:23.280 --> 11:24.120]  It's cool.
[11:24.120 --> 11:25.720]  Graffiti Falls.
[11:25.720 --> 11:30.720]  So we're talking about the votes that happened last night.
[11:31.840 --> 11:34.280]  Oregon, Alaska, and Washington DC
[11:34.280 --> 11:37.360]  have legalized recreational cannabis.
[11:37.360 --> 11:38.960]  Welcome to the cool kids club.
[11:38.960 --> 11:40.000]  Yeah.
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.360]  Florida, on the other hand,
[11:43.720 --> 11:46.400]  you're just old people in Disney World still.
[11:46.400 --> 11:48.400]  How many people in Florida
[11:49.440 --> 11:51.440]  do you think could actually reduce
[11:51.440 --> 11:56.440]  their pain medication consumption drastically?
[11:56.560 --> 11:59.360]  So do you think that maybe some of those pain companies,
[11:59.360 --> 12:01.920]  the pain clinics kind of lobbied against
[12:01.920 --> 12:04.080]  all of this medical cannabis or cannabis?
[12:04.080 --> 12:05.200]  No, surely not.
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.520]  I mean, I would think a big major corporation
[12:09.080 --> 12:10.200]  would have a lot more integrity than that.
[12:10.200 --> 12:12.080]  Good honest company that would need to do something
[12:12.080 --> 12:13.880]  like that because that would be kind of cheating
[12:13.880 --> 12:14.880]  and dishonest.
[12:16.120 --> 12:17.560]  Poisoning their citizens.
[12:18.600 --> 12:19.680]  Come on, big pharma.
[12:19.680 --> 12:20.520]  Yeah.
[12:20.520 --> 12:21.360]  Yeah.
[12:21.360 --> 12:23.720]  So if you did not go out and vote,
[12:23.720 --> 12:25.320]  you can't bitch about what happened in Florida,
[12:25.320 --> 12:26.960]  but if you voted in Florida,
[12:26.960 --> 12:29.240]  and I'm sorry you did not get your cannabis rights there.
[12:29.240 --> 12:31.680]  Oregon, Alaska, and Washington DC, however,
[12:31.680 --> 12:33.800]  congratulations, like that's awesome.
[12:33.800 --> 12:34.640]  Yeah.
[12:34.640 --> 12:35.480]  What were we gonna say?
[12:35.480 --> 12:36.320]  I kind of cut you off.
[12:36.320 --> 12:37.160]  I was gonna say,
[12:37.160 --> 12:38.320]  unless for some reason they're listening to this
[12:39.120 --> 12:39.960]  and they voted against it,
[12:39.960 --> 12:41.640]  then go fuck yourself.
[12:41.640 --> 12:44.840]  I will second that,
[12:44.840 --> 12:46.240]  but I will not pay the fine.
[12:48.080 --> 12:50.560]  Nobody's tallied up how many times I said the F word
[12:50.560 --> 12:51.480]  on so many episodes.
[12:51.480 --> 12:53.680]  So whoever was paying attention,
[12:53.680 --> 12:55.040]  you gotta go math that up for me.
[12:55.040 --> 12:56.640]  And we're gonna discontinue that actually.
[12:56.640 --> 12:58.600]  We're gonna stop doing it because I haven't said that
[12:58.600 --> 12:59.760]  in quite a long time on the show.
[12:59.760 --> 13:00.600]  So it's kind of cool.
[13:00.600 --> 13:02.360]  Somebody let me know what I owe and I'll pay it.
[13:02.360 --> 13:04.320]  I hit you on two for one episode.
[13:04.320 --> 13:05.160]  Yeah.
[13:06.160 --> 13:09.600]  I don't remember which one or when or where or anything.
[13:09.600 --> 13:10.840]  Dreadful J, where are you girl?
[13:10.840 --> 13:11.800]  He always listened to the show
[13:11.800 --> 13:13.320]  and remind me of funny stuff that I said.
[13:13.320 --> 13:15.520]  So count up those F words.
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.760]  What else was I gonna say?
[13:16.760 --> 13:19.640]  Washington DC, our nation's capital,
[13:19.640 --> 13:22.320]  now has legalized cannabis.
[13:22.320 --> 13:25.480]  Why doesn't the rest of the nation just follow suit
[13:25.480 --> 13:26.920]  with what the capital has done?
[13:26.920 --> 13:28.080]  Yeah.
[13:28.080 --> 13:31.640]  I guess there are intelligent people in DC.
[13:31.640 --> 13:33.880]  Contrary to popular belief.
[13:33.920 --> 13:37.200]  Hopefully they'll change some of their habits.
[13:37.200 --> 13:38.800]  Like while they're up there doing what they do
[13:38.800 --> 13:40.240]  instead of just droning on, they'll be like,
[13:40.240 --> 13:44.120]  yo bro, I think that these GMOs are a crock of shit.
[13:44.120 --> 13:47.440]  I think we need to knock this shit out bro.
[13:47.440 --> 13:48.840]  Can I get a I?
[13:48.840 --> 13:50.680]  And then everyone will be like, yeah.
[13:51.840 --> 13:54.440]  This just made getting a,
[13:54.440 --> 13:56.520]  smoking a joint in front of the White House photo op
[13:56.520 --> 13:57.560]  a lot easier.
[13:59.920 --> 14:01.360]  Well, that's, there was actually,
[14:01.360 --> 14:02.640]  I was at Garden of the Gods
[14:02.640 --> 14:05.360]  and I think I saw a sign that reminded you
[14:05.360 --> 14:06.280]  that that's a state park
[14:06.280 --> 14:08.320]  and you cannot bring your cannabis there.
[14:09.200 --> 14:11.000]  Yeah, because it's still federal land.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.640]  So I'm pretty sure that that White House land
[14:12.640 --> 14:15.320]  is federal land and you can't have your cannabis there.
[14:16.360 --> 14:17.200]  Good point.
[14:17.200 --> 14:19.160]  Yeah, if you go to a state park right now in Colorado,
[14:19.160 --> 14:21.280]  people that are not from Colorado, this is a random,
[14:21.280 --> 14:23.080]  we did not prepare this part at all.
[14:23.080 --> 14:27.080]  If you're not, if you were in a state park in Colorado,
[14:27.080 --> 14:29.080]  like Red Rocks is a state park.
[14:30.080 --> 14:33.840]  Most the reservoirs, like the Pueblo Reservoir,
[14:33.840 --> 14:35.760]  all the big reservoirs where you'd wanna go hang out,
[14:35.760 --> 14:37.480]  most of the cool shit is a state park.
[14:37.480 --> 14:39.840]  You cannot take, you can.
[14:39.840 --> 14:41.520]  I mean, you can, they're not stopping everybody
[14:41.520 --> 14:42.360]  from checking you.
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.200]  We've been doing it for years.
[14:43.200 --> 14:45.640]  Yeah, we do, but we're not gonna say we do,
[14:45.640 --> 14:46.480]  but you can take it.
[14:46.480 --> 14:47.320]  We're not encouraging it.
[14:47.320 --> 14:49.520]  It's illegal to actually have cannabis at a state park.
[14:49.520 --> 14:51.760]  So yeah, even if it's legal in DC,
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.200]  smoking a joint at the White House
[14:53.200 --> 14:54.720]  is still gonna be a little sketchy.
[14:54.720 --> 14:55.920]  Although shout out to Snoop Dogg.
[14:55.920 --> 14:58.000]  Snoop claims that he smoked that weed
[14:58.080 --> 14:59.560]  at the White House there.
[14:59.560 --> 15:00.720]  And also a big shout out to Willie.
[15:00.720 --> 15:02.760]  We know Willie smoked at the White House.
[15:02.760 --> 15:04.640]  So, all right.
[15:04.640 --> 15:05.480]  So-
[15:05.480 --> 15:07.440]  Bill Clinton smoked something there.
[15:07.440 --> 15:09.200]  Monica Lewinsky smoked something there.
[15:09.200 --> 15:12.560]  She just turned 50 recently
[15:12.560 --> 15:13.920]  and there were pictures of her online.
[15:13.920 --> 15:16.640]  I'm not gonna comment on the pictures, but that did happen.
[15:16.640 --> 15:19.800]  Oh man, doesn't that kind of make you feel old?
[15:19.800 --> 15:21.240]  I wasn't gonna go there.
[15:21.240 --> 15:23.960]  That did come to cross my mind, but all right.
[15:23.960 --> 15:25.760]  We've been talking about,
[15:25.800 --> 15:27.920]  Jesse and I were talking about building a room
[15:27.920 --> 15:28.880]  a couple of episodes back
[15:28.880 --> 15:30.080]  and we're talking about planning your grow room.
[15:30.080 --> 15:32.280]  We talked about selecting your space,
[15:32.280 --> 15:34.120]  being a responsible grower.
[15:34.120 --> 15:35.600]  On this episode, we're gonna talk more about building
[15:35.600 --> 15:36.640]  and setting up your grow.
[15:36.640 --> 15:38.560]  We're gonna discuss grow tents a little bit
[15:38.560 --> 15:40.840]  or those hydro huts or whatever you wanna call them.
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.400]  And maybe if we have enough time,
[15:42.400 --> 15:43.520]  we're already 15 minutes in.
[15:43.520 --> 15:44.360]  If we have enough time,
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.760]  I will try to tackle that $500 grow room question.
[15:48.760 --> 15:49.760]  That's gonna be a challenge,
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.200]  but basically do everything that we're doing
[15:53.200 --> 15:54.840]  and go much smaller.
[15:54.960 --> 15:56.640]  We don't even get to pots and soil and stuff
[15:56.640 --> 15:57.640]  on the stuff that I've got written
[15:57.640 --> 15:59.600]  and we've got five pages of stuff typed out.
[15:59.600 --> 16:01.320]  So this is gonna be a lot.
[16:03.240 --> 16:04.400]  We wrapped up the last grow episode
[16:04.400 --> 16:06.320]  with the talk about deciding
[16:06.320 --> 16:07.800]  how much light to use in your space.
[16:07.800 --> 16:09.480]  And we kind of talked about
[16:09.480 --> 16:10.520]  where you're gonna hang the lights
[16:10.520 --> 16:13.240]  and where you're gonna, my phone is making noise.
[16:13.240 --> 16:15.600]  That's a poor podcast move right there.
[16:15.600 --> 16:17.880]  Oh, it's already, nope.
[16:17.880 --> 16:20.520]  Yeah, it was on silent and I don't know what that was.
[16:20.520 --> 16:21.720]  All right.
[16:21.720 --> 16:23.640]  Yeah, talking about where you're gonna hang the lights,
[16:23.640 --> 16:24.560]  how you're gonna fit the humidity.
[16:25.280 --> 16:26.120]  We talked a little bit
[16:26.120 --> 16:27.320]  about bringing fresh air into the room.
[16:27.320 --> 16:29.160]  So now let's kind of talk about building a room,
[16:29.160 --> 16:30.000]  which is kind of helpful
[16:30.000 --> 16:33.320]  because Jesse has a lot of experience in this.
[16:33.320 --> 16:34.760]  Now you need to make a clean grow space
[16:34.760 --> 16:37.080]  that allows you to control the light cycles,
[16:37.080 --> 16:38.320]  the temperature during the day,
[16:38.320 --> 16:39.400]  the temperature during the night,
[16:39.400 --> 16:41.320]  and you need to control the humidity.
[16:41.320 --> 16:43.640]  And it's also ideal to have a lot of control
[16:43.640 --> 16:46.120]  over the air going in and out of the grow space.
[16:46.120 --> 16:48.280]  If you're using an extra bedroom or a closet,
[16:48.280 --> 16:49.880]  you'll have all the walls already built,
[16:49.880 --> 16:52.120]  but you'll need to work around the existing room.
[16:52.120 --> 16:54.360]  Jesse was talking about working in a brick building
[16:55.120 --> 16:55.960]  or a brick facility.
[16:55.960 --> 16:56.800]  I don't know where it is.
[16:56.800 --> 16:57.640]  I didn't ask.
[16:57.640 --> 16:58.480]  I don't wanna know,
[16:58.480 --> 17:00.800]  but he was talking about it's 150 years old and it's brick.
[17:00.800 --> 17:01.640]  And that's gotta suck
[17:01.640 --> 17:04.080]  because you don't have a thing to screw shit into.
[17:04.080 --> 17:06.080]  Bricks crumble if you hit them with a hammer
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.880]  and try to put nails into them.
[17:07.880 --> 17:09.120]  Shit can go really wrong.
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.480]  If you move one brick, now you've got an unstable wall.
[17:12.480 --> 17:14.920]  All right, so I'm ranting about a brick.
[17:14.920 --> 17:16.880]  If you've got an open area, like a garage or a basement,
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.280]  or maybe Jesse's brick area,
[17:18.280 --> 17:20.200]  you're gonna need to build a room.
[17:20.200 --> 17:22.000]  You could just hang lights up in your garage
[17:22.000 --> 17:23.040]  or in that basement,
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.120]  but it's gonna be a lot easier
[17:24.880 --> 17:27.640]  if you build a room or set up a free prefabricated grow hut
[17:27.640 --> 17:29.840]  because that just gives you actually control
[17:29.840 --> 17:32.240]  over your environment and an environment.
[17:32.240 --> 17:34.600]  Simple reflection and trapping the light
[17:34.600 --> 17:36.160]  and having it reflect around
[17:36.160 --> 17:38.920]  makes the light up to 30% more efficient
[17:38.920 --> 17:40.200]  is what I read in a couple of books.
[17:40.200 --> 17:42.120]  One said 20, one said 30.
[17:42.120 --> 17:44.560]  How about we'll settle on 25% more efficient?
[17:44.560 --> 17:46.600]  And if you're running a thousand watt light,
[17:46.600 --> 17:50.280]  that's 250 watts basically of efficiency
[17:50.280 --> 17:53.160]  that you're going to not lose by having more reflection.
[17:53.200 --> 17:55.480]  So just putting in a good designed room
[17:55.480 --> 17:57.840]  is already saving you money and increasing buds
[17:57.840 --> 17:59.880]  because like we talked about on another show,
[17:59.880 --> 18:03.480]  the light is the main nutrient for your plants.
[18:03.480 --> 18:05.240]  It's not what you pour in, it's not what you feed it,
[18:05.240 --> 18:06.440]  it's actually the light.
[18:06.440 --> 18:08.960]  So where are we?
[18:08.960 --> 18:11.360]  Let's actually get into building a room.
[18:11.360 --> 18:13.040]  I was looking at all kinds of stuff
[18:13.040 --> 18:14.080]  and trying to figure out how to do this.
[18:14.080 --> 18:17.280]  I just decided let's kind of build a four light room.
[18:18.360 --> 18:20.160]  We're gonna act like we're building it
[18:20.160 --> 18:22.440]  either in a garage that's got plenty of room
[18:22.480 --> 18:25.120]  or the basement that's got plenty of room
[18:25.120 --> 18:26.480]  or maybe in a warehouse.
[18:27.400 --> 18:29.680]  Sorry about the coughs guys, we've been taking dabs.
[18:29.680 --> 18:30.880]  So let's build a room.
[18:30.880 --> 18:35.200]  We need four 1000 watt lights, an air conditioner,
[18:35.200 --> 18:36.440]  a way to remove the humidity
[18:36.440 --> 18:38.560]  and a way to draw in fresh air.
[18:38.560 --> 18:39.880]  So let's choose, like I said,
[18:39.880 --> 18:41.760]  we're gonna do the basement or a garage
[18:41.760 --> 18:42.600]  or something like that,
[18:42.600 --> 18:44.520]  that we wanna build a four light room.
[18:44.520 --> 18:46.080]  I wanna build a room that's, go ahead.
[18:46.080 --> 18:46.960]  How big is this room?
[18:46.960 --> 18:47.800]  That's what I was just gonna say.
[18:47.800 --> 18:48.640]  Oh, my bad.
[18:48.640 --> 18:50.440]  Eight by eight because two by fours
[18:50.440 --> 18:52.200]  come in eight foot sections, right?
[18:52.960 --> 18:54.160]  Or whatever we decide to use.
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.320]  Two by four, well, you can get them in tens too.
[18:56.320 --> 18:57.160]  Okay.
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.000]  Yeah.
[18:58.000 --> 18:59.200]  But most of us aren't gonna have a 10 foot ceiling
[18:59.200 --> 19:00.240]  in our basement or garage.
[19:00.240 --> 19:01.080]  For sure.
[19:01.080 --> 19:01.920]  So I was gonna just stick with the,
[19:01.920 --> 19:03.320]  you can buy a bunch of eight by eights,
[19:03.320 --> 19:05.320]  a bunch of eight foot two by fours.
[19:05.320 --> 19:07.760]  And I think you could set up this room in a day.
[19:07.760 --> 19:08.600]  That'd be nice.
[19:08.600 --> 19:09.440]  Yeah.
[19:09.440 --> 19:11.800]  You and I could do it in probably five hours
[19:11.800 --> 19:13.800]  cause we've done this enough times.
[19:13.800 --> 19:16.440]  So if you're gonna use a grow hut or something
[19:16.440 --> 19:18.120]  or a pre-made grow lab,
[19:18.120 --> 19:19.720]  what do you guys, do you guys sell grow huts
[19:19.720 --> 19:21.560]  over at HydroIndoor Growing Supplies?
[19:22.360 --> 19:24.480]  We have grow hut.
[19:24.480 --> 19:25.880]  We have a generic brand.
[19:25.880 --> 19:26.960]  Is it the grow lab?
[19:27.880 --> 19:29.240]  And we have a grow labs too.
[19:29.240 --> 19:30.200]  Okay.
[19:30.200 --> 19:34.960]  The generic brand is different than the grow labs.
[19:34.960 --> 19:35.800]  I've never seen one,
[19:35.800 --> 19:37.920]  but we can get a really good price on them.
[19:37.920 --> 19:38.760]  All right.
[19:38.760 --> 19:39.920]  And they're just basic, you know.
[19:39.920 --> 19:41.560]  I use the grow labs.
[19:41.560 --> 19:42.400]  That's what I have too.
[19:42.400 --> 19:44.600]  I think they're grow lab 120s or something like that.
[19:44.600 --> 19:45.720]  Or the five by fives.
[19:45.720 --> 19:46.560]  Yeah.
[19:46.560 --> 19:47.400]  Those are sweeps.
[19:47.400 --> 19:48.240]  Same thing.
[19:48.240 --> 19:49.080]  Throw a thousand watt light in there.
[19:49.080 --> 19:49.920]  And those are awesome.
[19:49.920 --> 19:51.000]  They also make a 10 by 10 one,
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.800]  which would work perfectly
[19:53.800 --> 19:55.080]  for what we're gonna talk about here.
[19:55.080 --> 19:55.960]  It would be,
[19:55.960 --> 19:57.960]  we're gonna basically build an eight by eight version
[19:57.960 --> 19:59.160]  of that 10 by six,
[19:59.160 --> 20:01.520]  10 by 10 feet by 10 feet by six high, I think,
[20:01.520 --> 20:02.560]  or seven high.
[20:02.560 --> 20:04.760]  We're just gonna make an eight by eight by eight room.
[20:04.760 --> 20:07.680]  And one of the best ways to build a room,
[20:07.680 --> 20:09.400]  you know, even like a big, huge warehouse,
[20:09.400 --> 20:13.840]  what they do is essentially they build a gigantic grow hut
[20:13.840 --> 20:18.360]  out of two by fours and, you know, drywall and everything.
[20:18.360 --> 20:20.440]  They'll build a room inside of a room,
[20:20.880 --> 20:25.160]  even in like the vertical commercial lettuce farms
[20:25.160 --> 20:26.000]  and stuff like that.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.720]  That's, they start with these cells.
[20:27.720 --> 20:28.760]  So, you know,
[20:31.760 --> 20:32.880]  you need to, you know,
[20:32.880 --> 20:35.440]  sometimes looking at a 10 by 10,
[20:35.440 --> 20:37.160]  a grow hut, they're kind of expensive,
[20:37.160 --> 20:39.280]  but so is building a 10 by 10 room.
[20:39.280 --> 20:40.120]  Right.
[20:40.120 --> 20:40.960]  And if you're not,
[20:42.760 --> 20:44.240]  if you can build a 10 by 10,
[20:44.240 --> 20:45.440]  you can build this eight by eight room.
[20:45.440 --> 20:46.280]  You've got the tools and everything.
[20:46.280 --> 20:47.560]  You know, build us a house.
[20:47.560 --> 20:48.400]  Yeah.
[20:48.400 --> 20:49.280]  I don't have,
[20:49.680 --> 20:50.800]  I've got basic skills,
[20:50.800 --> 20:52.640]  but for me buying the 10 by 10 hut
[20:52.640 --> 20:56.040]  and snapping those pieces together is so much easier for me.
[20:56.040 --> 20:58.000]  And if something were to go wrong in your grow,
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.800]  the thing comes down in an hour.
[20:59.800 --> 21:01.560]  You could have everything down,
[21:01.560 --> 21:03.720]  concealed in one hour,
[21:03.720 --> 21:05.280]  move it to another spot and put it back up,
[21:05.280 --> 21:07.720]  hopefully in another hour with those grow huts.
[21:07.720 --> 21:09.880]  And if you're like working in a garage
[21:09.880 --> 21:12.680]  or a big open basement, I mean, you know, it's just,
[21:13.760 --> 21:15.560]  if you want to expand and stuff like that,
[21:15.560 --> 21:18.480]  there's a lot of good reasons to have multiple rooms
[21:18.480 --> 21:19.960]  when it comes to pest control,
[21:20.880 --> 21:22.840]  equipment failure and all kinds of stuff like that.
[21:22.840 --> 21:25.880]  You know, it's good to double up.
[21:25.880 --> 21:27.200]  I agree completely.
[21:27.200 --> 21:29.600]  If you get bugs over in this room
[21:29.600 --> 21:30.440]  or if you have an equipment,
[21:30.440 --> 21:32.400]  and like you said, if the air conditioner fails in this room,
[21:32.400 --> 21:33.840]  it didn't fail in every room.
[21:33.840 --> 21:36.840]  It only failed in one light or four lights worth of stuff.
[21:36.840 --> 21:39.760]  It only murdered 30 plants instead of a hundred.
[21:39.760 --> 21:40.600]  All right.
[21:40.600 --> 21:41.480]  So I'm glad Jesse said that part
[21:41.480 --> 21:43.440]  about building a room within a room.
[21:43.440 --> 21:44.760]  He comes in handy sometimes.
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.080]  Cause most of what I wrote
[21:46.080 --> 21:47.840]  was about building a room inside of a room.
[21:48.200 --> 21:49.400]  I was going to say frame out an eight by eight room
[21:49.400 --> 21:50.760]  that's nice and tall.
[21:50.760 --> 21:51.600]  I was going to say,
[21:51.600 --> 21:53.080]  try to leave as much headroom as you can,
[21:53.080 --> 21:54.920]  but most of us are going to be in a basement or garage.
[21:54.920 --> 21:56.720]  So we'll be limited on space.
[21:56.720 --> 21:57.560]  And then I said,
[21:57.560 --> 21:59.960]  if you can use the full eight foot two by fours,
[21:59.960 --> 22:00.800]  you're in good luck.
[22:00.800 --> 22:01.960]  So frame out your eight by eight by eight room
[22:01.960 --> 22:03.120]  wherever you're working.
[22:03.120 --> 22:06.000]  And then here's where I kind of start getting into detail
[22:06.000 --> 22:07.000]  since Jesse kind of,
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.080]  I'm so glad you said build a room inside of a room.
[22:09.080 --> 22:10.720]  Cause that's most of what I wrote
[22:10.720 --> 22:12.040]  is build a room inside of a room.
[22:12.040 --> 22:15.480]  Even like big, like restaurants
[22:15.480 --> 22:16.800]  and old buildings and stuff like that.
[22:16.800 --> 22:19.440]  That's how they make it sanitary.
[22:19.440 --> 22:20.280]  Make it look all nice.
[22:20.280 --> 22:21.120]  Just build a shell.
[22:21.120 --> 22:22.320]  It's called over framing.
[22:23.440 --> 22:24.280]  All right.
[22:24.280 --> 22:25.600]  So over frame yourself a nice room.
[22:25.600 --> 22:26.440]  All right.
[22:26.440 --> 22:27.480]  You got an eight by eight room just framed.
[22:27.480 --> 22:30.360]  You don't need to frame it like super rigidly secure.
[22:30.360 --> 22:32.880]  You just need a couple of cross beams.
[22:32.880 --> 22:36.040]  24 inch studs every 24 inches.
[22:36.040 --> 22:39.280]  So have Jesse or I stand every 24 inches is what he said.
[22:39.280 --> 22:42.000]  You need a stud every 24 inches.
[22:42.000 --> 22:42.880]  Plan for a door.
[22:42.880 --> 22:45.120]  Sometimes you guys forget doors.
[22:45.160 --> 22:47.120]  Hydro shop sell.
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.280]  I don't know if you guys have this yet,
[22:48.280 --> 22:49.440]  but I've seen this at plenty.
[22:49.440 --> 22:50.280]  Okay.
[22:50.280 --> 22:51.120]  It's like a sticker.
[22:51.120 --> 22:52.960]  You stick it right on your, on the Mylar.
[22:52.960 --> 22:53.920]  We're going to talk, or not the Mylar,
[22:53.920 --> 22:55.640]  the poly we're going to talk about later.
[22:55.640 --> 22:57.520]  And then use a razor and you unzip the zipper.
[22:57.520 --> 22:58.360]  And as you unzip it,
[22:58.360 --> 23:00.160]  you just follow your razor right along with it
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.320]  and cut a hole in the poly.
[23:01.320 --> 23:02.800]  And now you have a zippered door.
[23:02.800 --> 23:05.560]  Do not unzip it before you stick it on.
[23:07.160 --> 23:08.080]  Has that happened?
[23:09.000 --> 23:09.840]  Okay.
[23:09.840 --> 23:10.680]  We're just going to move on
[23:10.680 --> 23:11.520]  because we don't want to make fun of your customer
[23:11.520 --> 23:12.360]  that did that.
[23:13.240 --> 23:15.000]  You're going to need to put some beams across the top
[23:15.840 --> 23:16.680]  to hang your equipment.
[23:16.680 --> 23:18.640]  So now you've got this eight by eight building,
[23:18.640 --> 23:22.240]  just a frame, studs every 24 inches,
[23:22.240 --> 23:23.240]  maybe a couple across,
[23:23.240 --> 23:24.880]  because you're going to hang some equipment.
[23:24.880 --> 23:27.000]  The roof beams.
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.120]  Well, depending on if you go all the way to the ceiling.
[23:31.120 --> 23:33.320]  If you don't go all the way to the ceiling,
[23:34.560 --> 23:36.920]  just stand your, don't lay them down,
[23:36.920 --> 23:39.360]  stand your two by fours up on the skinny edge.
[23:40.240 --> 23:41.760]  Get you some metal clamps.
[23:41.800 --> 23:45.000]  Get it screwed to the top of two walls
[23:45.000 --> 23:48.760]  and it'll help support the brace everything.
[23:48.760 --> 23:50.960]  You can hang lights from it, all kinds of neat shit.
[23:50.960 --> 23:52.240]  That's why we brought Jesse.
[23:52.240 --> 23:53.080]  That's why he's here.
[23:53.080 --> 23:55.400]  That's why he panned the big bucks.
[23:55.400 --> 23:57.680]  So once everything's framed up,
[23:57.680 --> 24:00.160]  you can insulate the room with the blue insulation boards.
[24:00.160 --> 24:01.760]  If you want to make it more soundproof
[24:01.760 --> 24:04.160]  and have more stable temps.
[24:04.160 --> 24:05.880]  I don't find that to be too necessary
[24:05.880 --> 24:07.000]  if you're in a basement.
[24:07.000 --> 24:08.280]  If you're in the garage, maybe,
[24:08.280 --> 24:10.800]  because it's going to get colder in the winter
[24:10.800 --> 24:11.840]  and hotter in the summer.
[24:11.840 --> 24:13.480]  But the basement, like we talked about,
[24:13.480 --> 24:16.240]  stays fairly cool most of the time.
[24:16.240 --> 24:17.640]  Some people choose to use plywood
[24:17.640 --> 24:19.160]  or some type of board on the walls.
[24:19.160 --> 24:20.280]  Whatever you want is cool.
[24:20.280 --> 24:21.640]  Build it how you like at that point.
[24:21.640 --> 24:24.120]  But once you've decided on the walls and insulation,
[24:24.120 --> 24:27.260]  that's when we hang, we call it poly or panda film.
[24:28.520 --> 24:30.080]  Poly is basically plastic sheeting
[24:30.080 --> 24:32.760]  that's white on one side and black on the other.
[24:32.760 --> 24:35.840]  Now you hang the white side on the inside of the room
[24:35.840 --> 24:38.640]  and the black side on the outside of the room.
[24:38.640 --> 24:40.720]  The white will keep the reflection of your light in there
[24:41.640 --> 24:42.760]  and give you more efficiency.
[24:42.760 --> 24:44.120]  You need to cover up the whole room,
[24:44.120 --> 24:46.040]  the walls, the floor, and the ceiling,
[24:46.040 --> 24:47.040]  and seal it up with tape.
[24:47.040 --> 24:49.520]  Seal up any spots where bugs can get in,
[24:49.520 --> 24:50.960]  any spots where light can get out.
[24:50.960 --> 24:53.120]  You want it to be a little fortress.
[24:53.120 --> 24:55.280]  That's its own private little room.
[24:55.280 --> 24:57.520]  You want to seal that shit up.
[24:57.520 --> 24:59.880]  And the more time you take and the tighter you get,
[24:59.880 --> 25:01.040]  all the plastic and everything,
[25:01.040 --> 25:06.040]  there's less of a spot for bugs to get and stuff like that.
[25:06.760 --> 25:07.600]  Take your time with this.
[25:07.600 --> 25:08.720]  Take your time with it.
[25:08.720 --> 25:11.680]  If you have a little bit of overlap everywhere,
[25:11.680 --> 25:13.840]  there's some kind of gap, that's a good idea.
[25:13.840 --> 25:15.160]  When you're putting your staples in,
[25:15.160 --> 25:18.520]  put down a little square of duct tape and then the staple.
[25:18.520 --> 25:20.600]  Yeah, because that'll help from the poly tearing
[25:20.600 --> 25:23.080]  and it'll also keep the staple in a little bit better.
[25:23.080 --> 25:26.320]  You can also go back and take a little bit
[25:26.320 --> 25:31.320]  of silicone caulking and stick that right over the staple.
[25:34.480 --> 25:37.080]  Had to make sure I got that dealt in there.
[25:37.120 --> 25:38.840]  You don't want to have your cock out in the grow room.
[25:38.840 --> 25:39.680]  Yeah.
[25:39.680 --> 25:40.520]  All right.
[25:40.520 --> 25:42.000]  So now you've basically built a little grow hut
[25:42.000 --> 25:43.560]  like we were talking about.
[25:43.560 --> 25:44.840]  Most of what we're going to talk about now
[25:44.840 --> 25:47.120]  works in the grow huts and it translates,
[25:47.120 --> 25:48.560]  that kind of translates to if you're just working
[25:48.560 --> 25:51.000]  with a bedroom, also if you haven't built a room.
[25:51.000 --> 25:52.920]  The main difference is you won't have the buffer zone
[25:52.920 --> 25:54.160]  around the grow area.
[25:54.160 --> 25:55.960]  If you're in a bedroom, you'll need to vent out of the room
[25:55.960 --> 25:58.520]  or the house without anybody noticing.
[25:58.520 --> 25:59.960]  The room that we've built inside of the rooms
[25:59.960 --> 26:01.040]  gives you more privacy
[26:01.040 --> 26:03.040]  and I feel like a little bit more control.
[26:03.040 --> 26:06.000]  Should we go over bedroom,
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.120]  how to vent out a window real snazzy, like real quick?
[26:10.120 --> 26:12.580]  I think I talk a little bit about it.
[26:15.200 --> 26:16.040]  Yeah, we can talk about it.
[26:16.040 --> 26:18.160]  And if when I get to it later on, we'll just skip it later.
[26:18.160 --> 26:19.000]  Okay.
[26:19.000 --> 26:22.920]  So crack your window open half inch, inch,
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.240]  kind of depends on how much airflow you need through it
[26:26.240 --> 26:27.600]  and then screw it shut
[26:29.440 --> 26:31.520]  or at least screw it to where it can't be opened
[26:31.520 --> 26:32.360]  any further.
[26:32.360 --> 26:37.040]  And you do that by real gently running a nice three inch
[26:37.040 --> 26:40.520]  screw through the, most people have vinyl windows
[26:41.680 --> 26:44.920]  through the inside track of where the window goes up
[26:44.920 --> 26:46.720]  and down, that'll hold the window shut,
[26:46.720 --> 26:49.000]  keep someone from ripping it open.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.520]  Then you take your window blinds,
[26:51.520 --> 26:54.720]  get you a nice new set of mini blinds, cheap ones,
[26:55.800 --> 26:58.160]  throw that down, close them so that, you know,
[26:58.160 --> 26:59.360]  no light can go through.
[26:59.840 --> 27:03.440]  Maybe leave them open a quarter inch at the bottom,
[27:03.440 --> 27:06.080]  air will still suck through it pretty, pretty good.
[27:07.080 --> 27:09.040]  And then take Panda film,
[27:09.040 --> 27:11.800]  put the white side to the outside of the window,
[27:11.800 --> 27:13.640]  staple it over that,
[27:13.640 --> 27:15.480]  and then take you a piece of plywood,
[27:16.480 --> 27:17.840]  screw it up over the wall,
[27:17.840 --> 27:21.720]  and you can cut holes and mount fans on there
[27:21.720 --> 27:23.200]  and all your ducting and everything.
[27:23.200 --> 27:24.040]  There you go.
[27:24.040 --> 27:24.880]  Yeah.
[27:24.880 --> 27:26.320]  So you can use one window as an intake
[27:26.320 --> 27:28.200]  and one window as an exhaust.
[27:28.360 --> 27:31.920]  Have you ever done the thing where you put the blinds up
[27:31.920 --> 27:33.640]  just like you said you,
[27:33.640 --> 27:36.160]  I would close the window or leave it open just a little bit.
[27:36.160 --> 27:37.000]  Okay, we got to leave it open
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.360]  for what we're doing on this one, sorry.
[27:38.360 --> 27:40.000]  Too many ideas in my head.
[27:40.000 --> 27:42.080]  You leave the half inch gap
[27:42.080 --> 27:45.760]  and then you build basically a box around the window.
[27:45.760 --> 27:47.480]  So you take some plywood
[27:47.480 --> 27:50.280]  and you make like three inch deep little square
[27:50.280 --> 27:52.800]  around the, like an inch around the window.
[27:52.800 --> 27:55.120]  And then you put a piece of plywood over that.
[27:55.120 --> 27:57.120]  And then you can put all your ducting in that plywood
[27:58.040 --> 28:00.320]  and it almost looks like you could put like a Christmas light
[28:00.320 --> 28:01.720]  or a candle light or something in there.
[28:01.720 --> 28:03.480]  And it looks like somebody's home all the time.
[28:03.480 --> 28:05.360]  And it just makes it look like you got a light
[28:05.360 --> 28:07.200]  and it just like it's the room.
[28:07.200 --> 28:09.000]  And then you can actually use that
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.280]  as ducting and shit too now,
[28:10.280 --> 28:11.240]  cause it's open.
[28:11.240 --> 28:13.840]  I did one, I actually stuck a Christmas light in there.
[28:13.840 --> 28:14.680]  Yeah.
[28:14.680 --> 28:15.520]  A yellow one.
[28:15.520 --> 28:16.640]  And it reflected off all the plastic
[28:16.640 --> 28:18.560]  and everything enough to, you know,
[28:18.560 --> 28:21.040]  you can just flip it on as a little timer and everything.
[28:21.040 --> 28:23.120]  And then now you've got a window open
[28:23.120 --> 28:24.120]  and it looks like somebody's home.
[28:24.120 --> 28:24.960]  You got a light on in there
[28:24.960 --> 28:26.280]  and it looks like it's just part of the normal.
[28:26.280 --> 28:27.120]  Yeah.
[28:27.120 --> 28:27.960]  So if you're-
[28:27.960 --> 28:30.480]  I have no idea why we would need to be that secretive.
[28:32.480 --> 28:33.880]  You know, it's mostly,
[28:33.880 --> 28:35.680]  I'm not as worried about the police
[28:35.680 --> 28:36.720]  as I am about the thieves.
[28:36.720 --> 28:38.360]  I actually heard a story about
[28:38.360 --> 28:40.200]  some thieves getting into somebody's air.
[28:40.200 --> 28:41.480]  They went in through their house
[28:41.480 --> 28:43.480]  through the air conditioning duct
[28:43.480 --> 28:47.000]  and were taking their plants while the people were home.
[28:47.000 --> 28:47.840]  Wow.
[28:47.840 --> 28:48.680]  They found out,
[28:48.680 --> 28:49.840]  and I shouldn't even be talking about this
[28:49.840 --> 28:50.880]  cause, yeah, whatever.
[28:50.880 --> 28:54.640]  But the people found out their plants were being stolen
[28:54.640 --> 28:56.160]  because of the cops knocked on the door
[28:57.000 --> 28:58.880]  and found kids running out their backyard with pot plants.
[28:58.880 --> 28:59.840]  Oh God.
[28:59.840 --> 29:00.760]  Yeah. Right?
[29:00.760 --> 29:01.840]  I don't know how that story ended.
[29:01.840 --> 29:03.280]  I bailed on that conversation.
[29:03.280 --> 29:04.120]  Yeah.
[29:04.120 --> 29:06.080]  Whew, scary shit.
[29:06.080 --> 29:06.920]  All right.
[29:06.920 --> 29:08.400]  So I hope my story about building the box
[29:08.400 --> 29:09.720]  around the window makes sense.
[29:09.720 --> 29:11.760]  I kind of had a vague idea of how to do that in my head.
[29:11.760 --> 29:13.040]  I was thinking too many thoughts.
[29:13.040 --> 29:14.000]  So you take a,
[29:14.000 --> 29:15.880]  just shape the size of the window.
[29:15.880 --> 29:16.960]  You add an inch square.
[29:16.960 --> 29:18.560]  So now if your window is 24 by 24,
[29:18.560 --> 29:21.520]  you make a 25 by 25 square piece of plywood
[29:21.520 --> 29:23.800]  and then you make a freaking box out of it.
[29:23.800 --> 29:24.640]  You know what I mean?
[29:24.640 --> 29:25.480]  Like a half box.
[29:25.800 --> 29:26.640]  You only need it three inches deep,
[29:26.640 --> 29:30.240]  make a little tray and then put that up against the window.
[29:30.240 --> 29:31.800]  And then you can put a curtain
[29:31.800 --> 29:33.320]  and just make it look like it's a real window.
[29:33.320 --> 29:34.160]  Yeah. It works.
[29:34.160 --> 29:35.760]  You guys can math that out in your brain.
[29:35.760 --> 29:36.600]  I hope, sorry.
[29:36.600 --> 29:38.320]  I wrote a bunch of shit and that's not on all my notes.
[29:38.320 --> 29:41.080]  You're just messing with my brain, man.
[29:41.080 --> 29:41.920]  Let's see.
[29:41.920 --> 29:43.520]  Where was I on all these papers?
[29:43.520 --> 29:46.960]  I hate, I hate sloppy windows.
[29:48.040 --> 29:50.440]  I've actually seen a few houses around town.
[29:50.440 --> 29:52.120]  You drive around and you're like, oh yeah.
[29:52.120 --> 29:52.960]  There's one.
[29:52.960 --> 29:53.800]  I know what that is.
[29:53.800 --> 29:54.640]  I know, yeah.
[29:54.880 --> 29:56.760]  There's actually two that I can drive to right now
[29:56.760 --> 29:58.600]  and be like, grow house, right there.
[29:58.600 --> 30:01.480]  You can always see the metal halide in the attic.
[30:01.480 --> 30:02.320]  All right.
[30:03.680 --> 30:06.360]  So hang that poly real carefully, like Jesse said.
[30:06.360 --> 30:07.800]  Take your time with the poly.
[30:07.800 --> 30:09.880]  This is the building of the room.
[30:09.880 --> 30:10.720]  These are your walls.
[30:10.720 --> 30:12.520]  You wouldn't build your house walls all shitty.
[30:12.520 --> 30:14.480]  You want your plant room, nice.
[30:15.480 --> 30:16.760]  Cover the whole room, seal it up.
[30:16.760 --> 30:18.040]  Seal any spots where shit can get in.
[30:18.040 --> 30:20.760]  Now we basically, you got that little grow hut.
[30:20.760 --> 30:21.680]  We're talking about a bedroom.
[30:21.680 --> 30:24.560]  I think I already did most of the part I'm talking about.
[30:25.560 --> 30:27.400]  So now you got the room built and sealed up.
[30:27.400 --> 30:28.240]  You're going to use a bedroom.
[30:28.240 --> 30:30.080]  Make sure to clean and dust the bedroom first.
[30:30.080 --> 30:30.920]  Get your-
[30:30.920 --> 30:31.760]  Pond liner.
[30:31.760 --> 30:32.600]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[30:32.600 --> 30:34.240]  That's definitely on my list of shit.
[30:34.240 --> 30:36.600]  Cover the windows where the light can get in or get out.
[30:36.600 --> 30:37.600]  Cover any cracks.
[30:37.600 --> 30:40.040]  If you've got cracks in the walls, cover those.
[30:40.040 --> 30:41.440]  Cover all your walls in the bedroom
[30:41.440 --> 30:42.520]  with reflective material.
[30:42.520 --> 30:44.920]  The Panda film works in a bedroom also.
[30:44.920 --> 30:46.920]  Pull up the carpet if you have that option.
[30:46.920 --> 30:48.040]  Cover the floor if possible.
[30:48.040 --> 30:51.120]  And right here, I like a pond liner for my floor.
[30:51.120 --> 30:52.680]  I like to get the pond liner
[30:52.680 --> 30:55.040]  about three to four inches up the wall
[30:55.040 --> 30:56.200]  all the way around the room.
[30:56.200 --> 30:58.720]  So if you do accidentally flood your res in that room
[30:58.720 --> 31:01.120]  or you spill a bucket or something, that's cool.
[31:01.120 --> 31:03.400]  You just got a pond liner there to catch it all.
[31:03.400 --> 31:05.320]  And in the doorway there,
[31:05.320 --> 31:07.440]  to help keep the doorway all sealed up,
[31:07.440 --> 31:09.900]  just cut you a door, a two by four,
[31:11.120 --> 31:12.680]  as wide as your doorway.
[31:12.680 --> 31:16.360]  Stand it up on the outside and screw it in place.
[31:16.360 --> 31:19.960]  And then that's a place to staple your pond liner too.
[31:19.960 --> 31:24.000]  So it turns a whole little bedroom into a pond.
[31:24.000 --> 31:25.920]  You're gonna have to step up when you go in and out,
[31:25.920 --> 31:27.040]  but big deal.
[31:27.040 --> 31:27.880]  I like the way you did that
[31:27.880 --> 31:31.040]  because I did it kind of a shitty way in my newest build.
[31:31.040 --> 31:33.260]  It works, but I didn't do it that smooth.
[31:35.200 --> 31:36.040]  This guy's actually nice over here.
[31:36.040 --> 31:38.160]  Also, it's a nice little air seal.
[31:38.160 --> 31:39.880]  If you put it real tight and everything,
[31:39.880 --> 31:41.480]  put a piece of foam in there.
[31:41.480 --> 31:43.220]  And that's something we're gonna talk a little bit about
[31:43.220 --> 31:45.280]  because some of us are gonna have to use that crevice
[31:45.280 --> 31:47.320]  underneath the door to let air in.
[31:47.320 --> 31:48.160]  Yeah, true.
[31:48.160 --> 31:49.200]  That's actually a pretty good spot
[31:49.440 --> 31:50.280]  for some of us.
[31:50.280 --> 31:52.400]  And that's, guys, everything I'm talking about
[31:52.400 --> 31:55.360]  is under ideal conditions.
[31:55.360 --> 31:59.320]  Yeah, I mean, I'm just trying to throw out ideals out there
[31:59.320 --> 32:01.600]  because there's so many ways you could use, I mean.
[32:01.600 --> 32:02.640]  And so much that-
[32:02.640 --> 32:03.760]  Different scenarios.
[32:03.760 --> 32:07.360]  If you walked into, okay, this is a four bedroom house.
[32:07.360 --> 32:08.840]  If we walked into all four bedrooms
[32:08.840 --> 32:10.120]  and tried to build a grow room in it,
[32:10.120 --> 32:11.760]  we'd have to deal with different obstacles
[32:11.760 --> 32:13.160]  in every single room.
[32:13.160 --> 32:15.520]  Each room would have different shit to deal with.
[32:15.520 --> 32:17.720]  That room's only got a window on that side.
[32:17.720 --> 32:19.180]  That room, you can't mess with the window
[32:19.180 --> 32:21.220]  because it's right up against the neighbor's house.
[32:21.220 --> 32:22.180]  If you exhaust out there,
[32:22.180 --> 32:23.460]  you're gonna be blowing heat
[32:23.460 --> 32:25.660]  into the neighbor's window, basically.
[32:25.660 --> 32:28.100]  So there'd be some obstacles.
[32:28.100 --> 32:28.940]  Yeah, all right.
[32:28.940 --> 32:29.760]  So wherever you are,
[32:29.760 --> 32:30.600]  you're gonna have to deal with some shit.
[32:30.600 --> 32:32.100]  Everything we're saying is just kind of,
[32:32.100 --> 32:34.020]  kind of hopefully gonna work for what we're doing.
[32:34.020 --> 32:35.660]  So now we've got this clean room, basically.
[32:35.660 --> 32:37.660]  We've got a hut that's sealed up.
[32:37.660 --> 32:39.060]  We're gonna add,
[32:39.060 --> 32:41.140]  so you get your eight by eight by eight room.
[32:41.140 --> 32:42.500]  It's all Panda filmed.
[32:42.500 --> 32:44.500]  Or you've got a 10 by 10 grow hut or whatever,
[32:44.500 --> 32:45.900]  something similar.
[32:45.900 --> 32:48.340]  Now this is where you wanna add an intake and an outtake.
[32:48.380 --> 32:50.340]  I talked in that last episode a lot
[32:50.340 --> 32:53.260]  about how important it is to venture the air in your grow.
[32:53.260 --> 32:55.340]  I like those inline style fans or blowers.
[32:55.340 --> 32:56.860]  I like the Vortex.
[32:56.860 --> 32:58.640]  Vortex has always been reliable.
[32:58.640 --> 33:00.260]  The Canfan is great.
[33:00.260 --> 33:01.200]  They're a little more expensive,
[33:01.200 --> 33:02.900]  but they're adjustable speed.
[33:02.900 --> 33:04.940]  And dude, those are reliable.
[33:04.940 --> 33:06.780]  Those green hydrofarm blowers,
[33:06.780 --> 33:07.600]  those are reliable.
[33:07.600 --> 33:09.100]  They work, but they're loud.
[33:09.100 --> 33:10.300]  Yeah, they're really loud.
[33:10.300 --> 33:14.140]  And the green hydrofarm inline boosters are junk.
[33:15.580 --> 33:16.420]  All right.
[33:16.420 --> 33:17.260]  Yeah.
[33:17.980 --> 33:19.380]  Don't waste your money on them.
[33:19.380 --> 33:20.620]  Jesse works at a hydro shop
[33:20.620 --> 33:22.300]  and I was not gonna bash any brand,
[33:22.300 --> 33:24.700]  but since he works there and has to order from them,
[33:24.700 --> 33:27.220]  we'll let him go ahead and talk shit.
[33:27.220 --> 33:28.060]  Yeah.
[33:28.060 --> 33:30.300]  Well, I mean, it is what it is.
[33:30.300 --> 33:31.620]  There's a reason they sell
[33:33.140 --> 33:34.980]  so many refurbished ones of those.
[33:34.980 --> 33:38.500]  That's a lot of grow stores who get the hydrofarm.
[33:38.500 --> 33:40.260]  No, I just better shut up.
[33:40.260 --> 33:41.100]  Yeah.
[33:41.100 --> 33:42.540]  All of what he says is allegedly,
[33:42.540 --> 33:44.100]  and I am not responsible for that.
[33:44.100 --> 33:46.420]  I like, for the room we're gonna build,
[33:46.420 --> 33:47.980]  we need an eight inch blower.
[33:48.940 --> 33:50.740]  I'm gonna say, get a can fan or a vortex
[33:50.740 --> 33:53.100]  and don't buy one of the green hydrofarm ones.
[33:53.100 --> 33:56.580]  Get a, if you can afford the can fan,
[33:56.580 --> 33:59.020]  get that, the vortex is ideal next.
[33:59.020 --> 34:01.980]  So yeah, the hydrofarm blowers are great.
[34:01.980 --> 34:03.340]  It's the boosters.
[34:03.340 --> 34:04.180]  Ah, okay.
[34:04.180 --> 34:05.000]  The ones that-
[34:05.000 --> 34:05.840]  The one that go in the ducting?
[34:05.840 --> 34:06.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[34:06.660 --> 34:07.580]  Those are all crap.
[34:07.580 --> 34:08.420]  Yeah, crap.
[34:08.420 --> 34:09.460]  No matter who makes them, those are all crap, I think.
[34:09.460 --> 34:11.920]  Can fans isn't bad, but it's,
[34:12.980 --> 34:14.260]  that's not a primary fan.
[34:14.700 --> 34:16.460]  You know, it's this booster on the box.
[34:16.460 --> 34:17.300]  Okay.
[34:17.300 --> 34:18.140]  All right.
[34:18.140 --> 34:19.300]  Yeah, if you got the right blower,
[34:19.300 --> 34:21.380]  you don't need the booster.
[34:21.380 --> 34:23.060]  So add that, let's see, where were we?
[34:23.060 --> 34:23.940]  Eight inch blower.
[34:23.940 --> 34:25.760]  Attach the blower to the framing
[34:25.760 --> 34:27.400]  and get it fairly high in the room.
[34:27.400 --> 34:28.460]  Depending on where you are,
[34:28.460 --> 34:29.580]  some of you guys might need to do this
[34:29.580 --> 34:30.820]  in the dead center of the room.
[34:30.820 --> 34:32.460]  Some of you may need to do it off to a corner.
[34:32.460 --> 34:33.940]  Just try to get it high.
[34:33.940 --> 34:35.940]  I think it's better to get the heat high.
[34:35.940 --> 34:37.860]  It's better to dump it out of the room high.
[34:37.860 --> 34:39.300]  I like to do everything high.
[34:40.900 --> 34:41.740]  All right.
[34:41.740 --> 34:43.380]  So now this is when you need to decide
[34:43.380 --> 34:46.180]  if you're going to use vented hoods or open hoods.
[34:46.180 --> 34:48.060]  Vented hoods are the ones,
[34:48.060 --> 34:49.740]  just for the people that are new at this,
[34:49.740 --> 34:51.620]  your light reflectors and hoods.
[34:51.620 --> 34:53.540]  Vented ones mean they have glass on the bottom
[34:53.540 --> 34:55.660]  and they're sealed and your ducting will attach to it.
[34:55.660 --> 34:58.340]  And the light will be moved away from the grow
[34:58.340 --> 35:00.620]  and not dropping down onto your plants.
[35:00.620 --> 35:01.820]  If you have open hoods,
[35:01.820 --> 35:04.220]  you're going to have to have more air conditioning,
[35:04.220 --> 35:06.880]  but you don't have to have as much ducting.
[35:06.880 --> 35:09.140]  So that's when you need to think about what you got to do.
[35:09.140 --> 35:11.740]  You get more value for your light that way,
[35:11.740 --> 35:14.460]  but air conditioning is expensive.
[35:14.460 --> 35:16.020]  Right. I like the vented style.
[35:16.020 --> 35:19.220]  Yeah. That's pretty much industry standard, I'd say.
[35:19.220 --> 35:20.420]  Yeah. Unless you're in,
[35:20.420 --> 35:22.580]  I've actually seen a couple of huge rooms
[35:22.580 --> 35:25.660]  that just dump AC at ridiculous levels.
[35:25.660 --> 35:26.660]  And it's-
[35:26.660 --> 35:28.140]  I've worked in a couple.
[35:28.140 --> 35:28.980]  Yeah.
[35:28.980 --> 35:30.800]  But if you're supplementing CO2 and stuff,
[35:30.800 --> 35:32.260]  you can't be exhausting a lot.
[35:32.260 --> 35:33.100]  Yeah.
[35:33.100 --> 35:34.300]  It takes a little bit more work.
[35:35.780 --> 35:37.580]  And if you're really cool kids,
[35:37.580 --> 35:40.780]  you got the Govitas or the NanoLuxes or something like that.
[35:40.780 --> 35:43.540]  Oh yeah. Those Govitas, you can't duct those.
[35:43.540 --> 35:44.620]  So then you're going to have, okay.
[35:44.620 --> 35:45.680]  So if you're using Govitas,
[35:45.680 --> 35:47.580]  you're going to have to use more air conditioning.
[35:47.580 --> 35:48.420]  A lot more.
[35:48.420 --> 35:49.740]  A lot more. All right.
[35:49.740 --> 35:51.880]  So if you're using open hoods and you're trying,
[35:51.880 --> 35:53.460]  for the ducting situation we're doing,
[35:53.460 --> 35:56.260]  you can just attach a carbon filter to your eight inch
[35:56.260 --> 35:59.740]  blower and now you've pretty much finished the extraction.
[35:59.740 --> 36:01.080]  But if you're using,
[36:02.340 --> 36:04.140]  make sure you use the carbon filter also.
[36:04.140 --> 36:04.980]  That's what I want to add.
[36:04.980 --> 36:05.980]  Make sure you're using the carbon filter
[36:05.980 --> 36:06.820]  on the extraction fan.
[36:06.820 --> 36:09.940]  Cause your crop is going to stink like about week six.
[36:09.940 --> 36:11.860]  You're going to be able to smell everything.
[36:11.860 --> 36:14.260]  I just hit week five in the middle of week five in a room.
[36:14.260 --> 36:15.780]  And that, uh,
[36:15.780 --> 36:18.780]  that Gorilla Glue number four is a stinky little bitch.
[36:18.780 --> 36:20.220]  Oh my God.
[36:20.220 --> 36:23.740]  So if you do use vented hoods, you got to run ducting.
[36:23.740 --> 36:25.780]  We're running four lights in this design.
[36:25.780 --> 36:28.240]  So I would do it kind of like this,
[36:28.240 --> 36:30.300]  but I'm going to take a little drink of this drink first,
[36:30.300 --> 36:31.580]  right now, taking a drink.
[36:36.260 --> 36:38.120]  That was well-deserved.
[36:38.120 --> 36:38.960]  All right.
[36:38.960 --> 36:41.400]  So if we're building this room with four lights,
[36:41.400 --> 36:43.120]  I would put a large carbon filter.
[36:43.120 --> 36:45.640]  I like the 39 by eight carbon filter.
[36:45.640 --> 36:46.920]  They have those available right now
[36:46.920 --> 36:48.580]  at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[36:49.600 --> 36:52.280]  Then I would take that 38 by eight inch carbon,
[36:52.280 --> 36:54.200]  39 by eight inch carbon filter.
[36:54.200 --> 36:55.680]  I would use an eight inch wide duct
[36:55.680 --> 36:58.920]  that goes into two six inch ducts.
[36:58.920 --> 37:00.640]  So now my eight just went to two sixes
[37:00.640 --> 37:02.480]  and I would use the Y to run the ducting
[37:02.480 --> 37:04.500]  to two lights on each side.
[37:04.500 --> 37:08.500]  So I would have light one A, light two A,
[37:08.500 --> 37:11.980]  and then light one B, light two B on opposite sides,
[37:11.980 --> 37:14.500]  and then use another Y duct, more ducting,
[37:14.500 --> 37:17.060]  and then a Y duct to bring them back together.
[37:17.060 --> 37:20.440]  And then attach that Y duct and the eight inch blower.
[37:22.740 --> 37:23.740]  I wrote something weird there.
[37:23.740 --> 37:25.380]  Attach that Y and the eight inch blower
[37:25.380 --> 37:27.080]  and the blower, send the air out of the room.
[37:27.080 --> 37:28.120]  Something I wrote doesn't make sense,
[37:28.120 --> 37:31.940]  but attach that Y duct to the blower and then send the air.
[37:31.940 --> 37:33.220]  See, I already have something wrong here
[37:33.220 --> 37:35.340]  because you should have carbon filter blower
[37:35.340 --> 37:36.700]  is the way it should go.
[37:36.700 --> 37:39.780]  So it should be carbon filter blower, ducting,
[37:39.780 --> 37:44.780]  or carbon filter blower, Y, ducting, light, light, Y,
[37:45.260 --> 37:47.900]  and then out of the house is where it should go.
[37:47.900 --> 37:49.100]  I typed something different,
[37:49.100 --> 37:51.200]  but I must've just been high at that time.
[37:52.500 --> 37:54.460]  That'd be a good spot for a booster fan.
[37:54.460 --> 37:57.260]  That right at the end there would be the perfect spot.
[37:57.260 --> 37:59.540]  So in this case, we're running it out of the grow hut
[37:59.540 --> 38:02.260]  or out of this eight by eight room that we built.
[38:02.260 --> 38:03.460]  Or if you're doing the bedroom,
[38:03.460 --> 38:05.460]  that's when you got to build that little wall
[38:05.460 --> 38:06.660]  and run it out of that duct
[38:06.660 --> 38:08.560]  or that little box that we made there.
[38:10.100 --> 38:10.940]  That was a good burp.
[38:10.940 --> 38:13.040]  I'm glad I got that one off the microphone.
[38:14.180 --> 38:15.980]  In some cases, you're going to need to run the ducting
[38:15.980 --> 38:18.140]  out of the house or to another room.
[38:18.140 --> 38:20.020]  Booster fans come in handy there.
[38:20.020 --> 38:23.960]  Try to keep the ducting as short and straight as possible.
[38:23.960 --> 38:25.540]  You don't want a lot of bends in your ducting
[38:25.540 --> 38:28.180]  and you don't want excessive long ducting.
[38:28.180 --> 38:31.620]  Also, if you can, hang your carbon filter from the ceiling.
[38:32.780 --> 38:34.420]  Because all of your heat and stale air
[38:34.420 --> 38:36.620]  is going to go up, hopefully.
[38:36.620 --> 38:38.180]  Air moves just like water.
[38:38.180 --> 38:43.180]  So, you know, if you got to pump it all the way
[38:43.340 --> 38:44.900]  to the ceiling from the floor,
[38:44.900 --> 38:47.660]  you know, that's just stealing energy.
[38:47.660 --> 38:48.500]  There you go.
[38:48.500 --> 38:49.320]  And heat rises.
[38:49.320 --> 38:51.940]  So you're putting that thing up there and you're, yeah.
[38:51.940 --> 38:52.780]  And then it won't suck as much air.
[38:52.780 --> 38:54.540]  And hot air stinks more too.
[38:54.540 --> 38:56.100]  Yes, that's very true.
[38:56.100 --> 38:57.340]  Stick it on the ceiling.
[38:57.340 --> 38:58.180]  Yeah.
[38:58.180 --> 38:59.860]  And your carbon filter will work better
[38:59.860 --> 39:02.100]  if you keep the humidity at a more acceptable level.
[39:02.100 --> 39:03.360]  Get it closer to 50.
[39:03.360 --> 39:04.800]  Get away from that 70%.
[39:04.800 --> 39:06.500]  Like I've seen a couple of guys in their flower rooms
[39:06.500 --> 39:07.640]  at 70% humidity,
[39:07.640 --> 39:09.480]  because they say it makes the bud sticky.
[39:09.480 --> 39:11.960]  It'll make your bud moldy is what you're going to get, bro.
[39:11.960 --> 39:15.440]  I've seen flower rooms with 0% humidity.
[39:15.440 --> 39:17.920]  So much good old Southern Colorado fresh air.
[39:17.920 --> 39:19.480]  I was just going to say, it's Colorado, bro.
[39:19.480 --> 39:21.520]  Don't look at me like that.
[39:21.520 --> 39:23.360]  And then your carbon filter pretty much
[39:23.360 --> 39:24.760]  quits working at that point too.
[39:24.760 --> 39:26.200]  Yeah.
[39:26.200 --> 39:27.040]  Yeah.
[39:27.040 --> 39:29.960]  You need some moisture to keep that charcoal active.
[39:29.960 --> 39:30.780]  All right.
[39:30.780 --> 39:31.620]  So we've got an exhaust set up.
[39:31.620 --> 39:33.380]  Now you need air in.
[39:33.380 --> 39:34.460]  Depending on the situation,
[39:34.460 --> 39:36.580]  I might make a four inch hole,
[39:36.580 --> 39:40.300]  six inches from the corners and six inches off the ground.
[39:40.300 --> 39:42.300]  So imagine there's the corner of the room.
[39:42.300 --> 39:45.020]  I would go six inches in and six inches up
[39:45.020 --> 39:47.060]  and make a four inch hole.
[39:47.060 --> 39:48.620]  And then on the opposite side of that corner,
[39:48.620 --> 39:49.460]  do the same thing.
[39:49.460 --> 39:52.900]  And that'll give you eight four inch holes for fresh air.
[39:52.900 --> 39:54.780]  Then I go and get those HEPA filters from Lowe's.
[39:54.780 --> 39:56.000]  They're just little square sheets.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.160]  And I staple those over the holes to keep any dirt, bugs,
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.880]  freaking dog hair, hippie hair,
[40:02.880 --> 40:04.240]  keep all that shit out of the grow room
[40:04.240 --> 40:05.080]  with those HEPA filters.
[40:05.080 --> 40:06.400]  They work pretty well.
[40:06.400 --> 40:09.640]  I use dryer vents to cover and prevent light leaks
[40:09.640 --> 40:10.480]  right on the outside.
[40:10.480 --> 40:13.500]  I put those on the outside to where,
[40:13.500 --> 40:15.080]  or you can put them on the inside too, if you need to,
[40:15.080 --> 40:15.920]  but I like them on the outside.
[40:15.920 --> 40:16.960]  They just look smoother.
[40:16.960 --> 40:18.240]  But you know, the inside may work
[40:18.240 --> 40:19.480]  because now the light's coming this way.
[40:19.480 --> 40:20.800]  It's not going to get in there.
[40:20.800 --> 40:22.720]  If you're using them for an intake,
[40:22.720 --> 40:24.880]  don't forget to take the little flapper out.
[40:24.880 --> 40:26.040]  Yeah.
[40:26.040 --> 40:27.480]  I've actually heard one going.
[40:28.320 --> 40:29.160]  I was like, what is that?
[40:29.160 --> 40:30.000]  No, oh shit.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.720]  I forgot to take that out.
[40:31.720 --> 40:32.720]  Yeah.
[40:32.720 --> 40:34.860]  You can replace the small holes with one big hole
[40:34.860 --> 40:36.420]  and you can have a blower in there.
[40:36.420 --> 40:38.960]  If you do have something bringing air in,
[40:38.960 --> 40:41.360]  make sure that it is smaller than the exhaust fan.
[40:41.360 --> 40:44.400]  You want to suck out more than what you're bringing in.
[40:44.400 --> 40:46.600]  You want to create negative pressure in a grow room.
[40:46.600 --> 40:48.560]  You want it to feel, if you have a real door,
[40:48.560 --> 40:50.400]  if it's in a bedroom, when you open the door,
[40:50.400 --> 40:51.720]  you want to turn the knob
[40:51.720 --> 40:54.120]  and you want the door to fly open on its own.
[40:54.120 --> 40:55.440]  That's how you know you've got enough pressure
[40:55.440 --> 40:56.280]  in a grow room.
[40:56.280 --> 40:57.120]  Negative pressure.
[40:57.120 --> 40:59.640]  Is that, no, it's negative, suck it.
[40:59.640 --> 41:01.840]  Oh yeah, yeah, nevermind.
[41:01.840 --> 41:04.160]  I was actually thinking of a room I was just in,
[41:04.160 --> 41:06.560]  so the door would have been, yeah, nevermind.
[41:08.320 --> 41:09.160]  We'll catch up.
[41:09.160 --> 41:10.040]  We'll get you on the same show.
[41:10.040 --> 41:11.280]  Well, I'm doing episode 39.
[41:11.280 --> 41:13.240]  I don't know what number you're on.
[41:13.240 --> 41:14.500]  42, man.
[41:16.640 --> 41:17.480]  So now we've,
[41:18.640 --> 41:20.400]  guys, I wonder what's going to happen on episode 42,
[41:20.400 --> 41:22.800]  because Jesse just jumped to the future on me.
[41:22.800 --> 41:24.240]  It clicked in my brain a second late.
[41:24.240 --> 41:25.960]  I was like, wait, man, we got to catch up.
[41:26.400 --> 41:28.720]  So you can replace all those holes with a big blower.
[41:28.720 --> 41:30.080]  You've got fresh air being pulled in
[41:30.080 --> 41:31.800]  when the exhaust fan pulls out stale air
[41:31.800 --> 41:33.720]  and humidity out of the room and out of the house.
[41:33.720 --> 41:35.200]  What does that even mean?
[41:35.200 --> 41:37.000]  You can tell I was lit when I wrote some of these notes
[41:37.000 --> 41:38.520]  and it got late.
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.400]  So we got fresh air coming in
[41:40.400 --> 41:42.520]  when the exhaust fan pulls the stale air
[41:42.520 --> 41:44.120]  and humidity out of the room.
[41:44.120 --> 41:47.760]  So you can add an air conditioner to bring in fresh air also.
[41:47.760 --> 41:49.160]  You might be able to bring in enough air
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.900]  under the bedroom door, if you're doing this in a bedroom.
[41:53.140 --> 41:56.740]  I had a perfect little grow when I first started off.
[41:56.740 --> 41:59.660]  It was in a bedroom and I had the blower going over one line.
[41:59.660 --> 42:00.980]  I had a six inch blower,
[42:00.980 --> 42:02.020]  and I was going over two lights
[42:02.020 --> 42:03.740]  and sucking that straight out of the room.
[42:03.740 --> 42:05.860]  And I hung the carbon filter in the ceiling
[42:05.860 --> 42:08.540]  and I just let the fresh air come right under the door.
[42:08.540 --> 42:10.540]  And I feel like it was enough air.
[42:10.540 --> 42:11.380]  Yeah, yeah.
[42:11.380 --> 42:13.180]  I feel like it was sufficient in there.
[42:13.180 --> 42:15.500]  It didn't get stifled or anything in there.
[42:15.500 --> 42:17.900]  So that space under the door, guys, that could be useful.
[42:17.900 --> 42:19.060]  You need fresh air coming in.
[42:19.060 --> 42:21.140]  So if you're building this big eight by eight room,
[42:21.220 --> 42:23.540]  cut some holes in there or add a blower.
[42:23.540 --> 42:24.940]  If you're using an eight inch blower out,
[42:24.940 --> 42:27.380]  you can use a four or a six inch blower in, I think,
[42:27.380 --> 42:29.340]  and you'll be just fine.
[42:29.340 --> 42:31.140]  And even if you're running a sealed room,
[42:31.140 --> 42:32.100]  I hate seeing this.
[42:32.100 --> 42:33.980]  This is a little more advanced stuff,
[42:33.980 --> 42:37.820]  but even sealed rooms need to have the ability
[42:37.820 --> 42:40.360]  to inject fresh air.
[42:42.420 --> 42:44.460]  You know, even if you don't use it,
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.620]  but once a week or something like that,
[42:46.620 --> 42:50.580]  you still need to recycle your air every now and then.
[42:50.980 --> 42:54.340]  Pumping CO2 into air, I don't know.
[42:54.340 --> 42:55.180]  I know.
[42:55.180 --> 42:56.020]  Do you know what I mean?
[42:56.020 --> 42:57.380]  I know what you mean.
[42:57.380 --> 42:59.740]  He's talking about a control,
[42:59.740 --> 43:02.060]  a closed environment agriculture room
[43:02.060 --> 43:03.180]  where everything is sealed up.
[43:03.180 --> 43:05.420]  The only air that goes in the room is CO2
[43:05.420 --> 43:07.060]  that's supplemented with a CO2 tank.
[43:07.060 --> 43:09.380]  We'll talk a little bit about that in the future
[43:10.340 --> 43:13.340]  because plants actually breathe CO2 and let out oxygen.
[43:13.340 --> 43:15.160]  But I think just pumping all that CO2 in there,
[43:15.160 --> 43:16.980]  they are gonna need some oxygen.
[43:16.980 --> 43:19.340]  Your roots need oxygen, your microbe life,
[43:19.340 --> 43:21.100]  it gets stale in there.
[43:21.100 --> 43:22.100]  Yeah, so I agree.
[43:22.100 --> 43:25.340]  You have to put some oxygen in that closed room somehow.
[43:25.340 --> 43:27.880]  And just use those HIPAA filters and filter your air.
[43:27.880 --> 43:30.940]  They also sell the shroom things, the shroom covers.
[43:30.940 --> 43:32.060]  I'm a big fan of those.
[43:32.060 --> 43:32.900]  Okay.
[43:32.900 --> 43:34.580]  I've always thought they were a little overpriced,
[43:34.580 --> 43:36.100]  so I've just stuck with the HIPAA filters.
[43:36.100 --> 43:37.140]  I can't argue with that.
[43:37.140 --> 43:37.980]  Yeah.
[43:39.500 --> 43:43.300]  We sell a much bigger intake filter
[43:43.300 --> 43:46.500]  that's similar to a carbon filter.
[43:49.740 --> 43:52.820]  It's not applicable in all situations,
[43:52.820 --> 43:56.460]  but it's very reasonably priced
[43:56.460 --> 43:58.260]  for what it is in the lifespan.
[43:58.260 --> 44:00.220]  It's just touch over a hundred
[44:00.220 --> 44:02.660]  and it does some serious filtering.
[44:02.660 --> 44:06.300]  So you can bring air from outside into your grow essentially
[44:06.300 --> 44:07.260]  if you filter it with that.
[44:07.260 --> 44:09.060]  Okay, sure, that's worth a ton of money.
[44:09.060 --> 44:12.580]  It looks like a gigantic K&N air filter
[44:12.580 --> 44:16.140]  for like a freaking F22 Raptor or some shit.
[44:16.260 --> 44:21.260]  Oh, I wonder, God, imagine when you're done with that thing,
[44:21.780 --> 44:24.460]  you go dump it in the fucking, oops, $5.
[44:24.460 --> 44:26.300]  You dump it in the fucking landfill.
[44:26.300 --> 44:27.140]  I'm not doing that anymore.
[44:27.140 --> 44:27.980]  I just called it was over.
[44:27.980 --> 44:30.020]  I'm glad you go dump it in the landfill.
[44:30.020 --> 44:31.340]  And he said it now,
[44:31.340 --> 44:33.340]  I'm just picturing like some sort of breaking bad desert
[44:33.340 --> 44:35.140]  is where I was watching somebody in my mind dump it
[44:35.140 --> 44:37.660]  and like throws it down in the desert and all these bugs.
[44:37.660 --> 44:39.980]  And like, imagine all the crazy shit that's going to come out
[44:39.980 --> 44:42.500]  cause you got a blower attached to it sucking.
[44:42.500 --> 44:45.060]  Every bug that flies by is going to go
[44:45.060 --> 44:46.300]  and just get sucked into that
[44:46.300 --> 44:47.900]  and get stuck in your trap now.
[44:49.020 --> 44:51.860]  We'll go hook it over the fence at the Monsanto facility.
[44:51.860 --> 44:53.380]  There we go.
[44:53.380 --> 44:54.740]  We're coming for you.
[44:54.740 --> 44:56.420]  Biological warfare.
[44:56.420 --> 44:57.900]  We're coming for you.
[44:57.900 --> 44:58.860]  All right, I'm going to try to,
[44:58.860 --> 45:01.420]  I've got like three more pages of stuff typed out.
[45:01.420 --> 45:02.820]  I'm going to have to edit out the F word.
[45:02.820 --> 45:05.580]  So we're going to have to finish the show pretty soon.
[45:05.580 --> 45:08.100]  You should leave just that part in though.
[45:09.420 --> 45:10.260]  I'll leave the F word in.
[45:10.260 --> 45:11.620]  I'm done with paying $5 for it.
[45:11.620 --> 45:14.900]  I already declared that earlier in the show, we're cool.
[45:15.740 --> 45:17.060]  I was just so daydreaming and thinking about like,
[45:17.060 --> 45:18.940]  where would this thing, cause you can't like,
[45:18.940 --> 45:20.420]  I wasn't picturing me and you doing it.
[45:20.420 --> 45:21.780]  I'm picturing like some shady grower
[45:21.780 --> 45:25.380]  with this big gigantic vent cleaner.
[45:25.380 --> 45:27.220]  And he's just rolling it out of the back of his truck
[45:27.220 --> 45:28.180]  in the desert somewhere.
[45:28.180 --> 45:30.860]  And I'm just like, oh, imagine what comes out of that dude.
[45:30.860 --> 45:34.860]  Hair, bugs, it's not going to be anything pretty.
[45:35.860 --> 45:40.340]  All kinds of weird molds and danders and pollens.
[45:40.340 --> 45:42.020]  Yeah. Oh, so gross.
[45:42.020 --> 45:42.860]  All right.
[45:43.820 --> 45:47.660]  That was one thing when I was actually researching it
[45:47.660 --> 45:49.460]  before we got it, I was like, oh,
[45:50.540 --> 45:55.540]  this would be great for protection from outdoor amateurs.
[45:56.460 --> 45:57.660]  Outdoor amateur pollen.
[45:57.660 --> 45:59.020]  Yeah.
[45:59.020 --> 45:59.860]  Or hemp.
[46:01.220 --> 46:03.100]  Man, I've got a mail that might blow soon.
[46:03.100 --> 46:05.660]  He just reminded me that I did not move it earlier.
[46:06.740 --> 46:07.820]  He's in a shitty spot.
[46:07.820 --> 46:10.700]  If he goes, I don't want that to happen.
[46:10.700 --> 46:12.500]  Premature.
[46:13.260 --> 46:14.100]  Yeah.
[46:14.100 --> 46:15.540]  I don't need him to go.
[46:15.540 --> 46:16.420]  He's in a bad spot.
[46:16.420 --> 46:17.260]  All right.
[46:17.260 --> 46:18.620]  So guys, we've been ranting here.
[46:18.620 --> 46:20.780]  We're going to try to get back on track for a little bit.
[46:20.780 --> 46:22.300]  We got 15 more minutes or so
[46:22.300 --> 46:23.900]  before everyone's going to get ADD.
[46:23.900 --> 46:26.180]  Kind of already happened to us.
[46:26.180 --> 46:27.820]  Since we've got ducting in place,
[46:27.820 --> 46:29.340]  let's hang up some lights guys.
[46:29.340 --> 46:31.220]  In this room, we have an eight by eight footprint
[46:31.220 --> 46:32.060]  and four lights.
[46:32.060 --> 46:34.740]  That means we can use a four by four area for each light.
[46:34.740 --> 46:35.700]  It's going to be bright in here.
[46:35.700 --> 46:36.740]  That's what we want.
[46:36.740 --> 46:38.860]  Divide the room into perfect quarters.
[46:38.860 --> 46:40.780]  Find the center for each quarter.
[46:40.780 --> 46:43.180]  Hang your lights so they're centered in the corners
[46:43.180 --> 46:44.420]  or the quarters, not corners.
[46:44.420 --> 46:46.380]  You want them centered in the quarters.
[46:47.300 --> 46:50.180]  So basically you got a four by four section
[46:50.180 --> 46:51.780]  with the light perfectly above it.
[46:51.780 --> 46:54.260]  And every four by four space has a light right above it.
[46:54.260 --> 46:55.980]  Jesse's doing math on how many lumens
[46:55.980 --> 46:57.500]  and how many Watts per square foot that is.
[46:57.500 --> 46:58.340]  Yes, it's impressive.
[46:58.340 --> 47:01.420]  You could do 600 wild lights in the setup if you wanted.
[47:01.420 --> 47:03.660]  Thousands are the way to go in here, I think.
[47:04.780 --> 47:06.020]  That's my professional opinion.
[47:06.020 --> 47:08.020]  If you've got the electricity and you're building this room,
[47:08.020 --> 47:09.180]  put thousands in there.
[47:09.220 --> 47:12.100]  Oh yeah, no, I totally agree.
[47:12.100 --> 47:13.700]  All right, I use those little-
[47:13.700 --> 47:16.580]  So 64 square feet, obviously.
[47:16.580 --> 47:17.660]  That's simple math.
[47:21.260 --> 47:22.220]  I'm all stoned.
[47:22.220 --> 47:23.620]  Work a calculator.
[47:26.380 --> 47:28.140]  Always divide things the wrong way.
[47:28.140 --> 47:33.140]  That's 62 Watts per square foot.
[47:33.740 --> 47:35.020]  And what would be your recommendation,
[47:35.020 --> 47:36.420]  Mr. Hydroshop expert?
[47:37.340 --> 47:40.940]  That's a really healthy lot per square foot.
[47:40.940 --> 47:42.500]  All right.
[47:42.500 --> 47:43.860]  This is going to be a healthy room.
[47:43.860 --> 47:45.620]  Hey Ryan, you've got a room kind of like this, dude.
[47:45.620 --> 47:46.660]  So good job.
[47:46.660 --> 47:48.420]  You might've taken some advice from me.
[47:48.420 --> 47:53.420]  That's no, Tierra Rojo, 120 Watts per square foot.
[47:54.900 --> 47:56.500]  Yeah, that indoor acre.
[47:56.500 --> 47:58.740]  And we're talking about a spot called the indoor acre
[47:58.740 --> 48:00.500]  is what is, that place is amazing.
[48:00.500 --> 48:02.700]  There's like a mile and a half of plumbing in there
[48:02.700 --> 48:04.540]  just for the hydro kit.
[48:04.540 --> 48:05.740]  All right, so we're hanging our lights.
[48:05.860 --> 48:06.700]  They're in the corner,
[48:06.700 --> 48:10.540]  the center of the quarters of the room, right?
[48:10.540 --> 48:11.980]  There might be a lot of editing on the show, guys.
[48:11.980 --> 48:12.980]  We're dabbed out.
[48:12.980 --> 48:14.300]  So I like to use those little eye hooks.
[48:14.300 --> 48:15.140]  I sell at Lowe's.
[48:15.140 --> 48:16.660]  They're just screws with a little circle
[48:16.660 --> 48:17.900]  at the end of it, basically.
[48:17.900 --> 48:19.340]  Screw that into the ceiling.
[48:20.420 --> 48:22.180]  Screw it directly into the ceiling beams.
[48:22.180 --> 48:23.900]  Make sure you hit a stud.
[48:23.900 --> 48:24.740]  Yes.
[48:24.740 --> 48:25.580]  Well, there'll only be studs there.
[48:25.580 --> 48:26.980]  I mean, you're looking to have mylar
[48:26.980 --> 48:28.940]  or a plastic or a stud.
[48:28.940 --> 48:30.100]  So make sure you get it in there, yeah.
[48:30.100 --> 48:31.660]  If you're in a bedroom though, yeah.
[48:31.660 --> 48:32.900]  Yeah, okay, there you go.
[48:32.900 --> 48:33.740]  Right on, I forgot about the bedroom.
[48:33.940 --> 48:35.580]  I actually got a quick trick for that
[48:35.580 --> 48:37.460]  and it helps you center your lights.
[48:37.460 --> 48:40.340]  Take two eight foot, two by fours,
[48:40.340 --> 48:41.500]  screw them to the ceiling.
[48:41.500 --> 48:42.940]  Then you can put your lights anywhere you want.
[48:42.940 --> 48:44.300]  You always know you hit a stud.
[48:44.300 --> 48:46.660]  Yeah, I need to do that in one area.
[48:49.980 --> 48:50.820]  I guess.
[48:50.820 --> 48:52.340]  Yeah.
[48:52.340 --> 48:54.660]  I worked at a place where the lights were,
[48:55.900 --> 48:58.980]  I worked for two companies in the same building,
[48:58.980 --> 48:59.820]  ironically,
[49:01.020 --> 49:02.740]  and at the first company,
[49:02.740 --> 49:05.060]  I didn't help set anything up
[49:05.060 --> 49:06.820]  and all of the lights were hung
[49:06.820 --> 49:09.180]  from a floating grid ceiling,
[49:09.180 --> 49:12.740]  big old raptor hoods with little tiny plastic hooks
[49:12.740 --> 49:16.900]  is absolutely like just super dangerous, dumb ass move.
[49:18.220 --> 49:20.100]  But when I went to work for the other company,
[49:20.100 --> 49:23.100]  I got paid to do a two by four structure
[49:23.100 --> 49:27.260]  all through that could support a couple of girls.
[49:27.260 --> 49:28.540]  So.
[49:28.540 --> 49:30.140]  Yeah guys, be safe when you're building stuff.
[49:30.140 --> 49:31.580]  We've talked about not being that asshole
[49:31.620 --> 49:32.820]  that burns down the house.
[49:32.820 --> 49:34.780]  Also don't be the guy that takes down the bedroom
[49:34.780 --> 49:36.020]  on accident.
[49:36.020 --> 49:36.860]  If you're renting,
[49:36.860 --> 49:39.260]  you're gonna have to pay for whatever you mess up.
[49:39.260 --> 49:40.100]  All right.
[49:41.180 --> 49:43.140]  I like those little light hangers to hang my lights.
[49:43.140 --> 49:44.940]  The ratchet style ones, those are perfect.
[49:44.940 --> 49:46.060]  I love them.
[49:46.060 --> 49:47.020]  Hang all four lights,
[49:47.020 --> 49:50.260]  screw in your bulbs and wipe off the bulbs when you're done.
[49:50.260 --> 49:51.100]  Wipe them off.
[49:51.100 --> 49:52.660]  I like to use like a,
[49:52.660 --> 49:54.460]  it's a thing that you should be cleaning your drums with.
[49:54.460 --> 49:56.860]  It's a little soft, it's like a microfiber.
[49:56.860 --> 49:57.700]  Yeah.
[49:57.700 --> 49:58.540]  Clean it off with that.
[49:58.540 --> 49:59.580]  Sunglass stuff.
[49:59.580 --> 50:00.420]  Yeah, sunglass stuff, exactly.
[50:00.860 --> 50:03.700]  You don't want any scratches in the bulb.
[50:03.700 --> 50:05.380]  Or any dust or dirt on there
[50:05.380 --> 50:07.260]  or any oil from your finger on there.
[50:07.260 --> 50:08.980]  Any little thing that close to the bulb
[50:08.980 --> 50:10.660]  is gonna definitely kill lumens.
[50:10.660 --> 50:13.380]  Make sure your bulb is screwed in completely.
[50:13.380 --> 50:14.820]  Yeah.
[50:14.820 --> 50:16.980]  And all of your connections are all pushed in tight
[50:16.980 --> 50:18.220]  on your ballast as well.
[50:19.180 --> 50:22.660]  So screw in your bulbs, wipe it off, make sure it's tight.
[50:22.660 --> 50:26.140]  Run the ducting from the blower to the Y duct to each light
[50:26.140 --> 50:28.140]  back to the other Y out of your grow room
[50:28.140 --> 50:30.660]  and then secure all of those ductings with tape.
[50:30.660 --> 50:33.260]  There's gonna be a lot of pressure on the ducts.
[50:33.260 --> 50:36.100]  An eight inch blower puts out a lot of pressure.
[50:36.100 --> 50:41.100]  It may be a good idea also to grab a fan speed controller.
[50:41.220 --> 50:44.140]  You plug that in and then you plug your fan into that
[50:44.140 --> 50:45.300]  and you can actually, your blower,
[50:45.300 --> 50:46.860]  your eight inch vortex blower,
[50:46.860 --> 50:50.780]  you can adjust how much by percentage of from,
[50:50.780 --> 50:53.220]  it only works about 50% is as low as I think it goes,
[50:53.220 --> 50:56.180]  but then you can go from 50 all the way to a hundred.
[50:56.180 --> 50:58.540]  If you're wanting to keep a little humidity in the room,
[50:58.540 --> 50:59.380]  turn it down.
[50:59.380 --> 51:03.820]  You can get it down to 50% humidity, turn it down to 70%.
[51:03.820 --> 51:04.660]  It'll help you out.
[51:04.660 --> 51:05.820]  That's actually how I run it in one space
[51:05.820 --> 51:07.620]  at about 70% all the time.
[51:07.620 --> 51:09.420]  And some of the can fans come with
[51:10.660 --> 51:12.420]  little three speed switch on the cord.
[51:12.420 --> 51:13.580]  Already adjusted to it.
[51:13.580 --> 51:15.220]  Yeah, so that may be beneficial.
[51:15.220 --> 51:18.220]  And the hyper fan, the best fan on the market,
[51:18.220 --> 51:20.900]  in my opinion, it comes with one built in.
[51:20.900 --> 51:23.020]  Ah, see that's a new product for me.
[51:23.020 --> 51:25.620]  When I upgrade, it's time for some of those.
[51:25.620 --> 51:28.220]  All right, so now we've got ducting, you got lights on.
[51:28.220 --> 51:30.220]  It's kind of starting to look like a grow room.
[51:30.220 --> 51:32.340]  You got to hang a couple of fans on the walls.
[51:32.340 --> 51:36.340]  I would put fans right above the expected height
[51:36.340 --> 51:37.180]  of your plants.
[51:37.180 --> 51:38.020]  Like if you think your plants
[51:38.020 --> 51:39.020]  are going to get five feet tall,
[51:39.020 --> 51:40.980]  put a fan at five and a half feet,
[51:40.980 --> 51:43.740]  right between the fan can, or the light can,
[51:43.740 --> 51:44.700]  damn, a lot of words,
[51:44.700 --> 51:46.820]  right between the plant canopy and the lights
[51:46.820 --> 51:48.580]  is kind of where I like a fan.
[51:48.580 --> 51:50.100]  Keep the air moving.
[51:50.100 --> 51:51.900]  You don't want the air to get stale.
[51:51.900 --> 51:54.220]  Plants suck up the CO2 in the room quickly.
[51:54.220 --> 51:57.220]  They can use the CO2 around them super quickly
[51:57.220 --> 51:58.220]  and you just got to move the air
[51:58.220 --> 52:00.220]  so there's more CO2 for them to use up.
[52:01.180 --> 52:02.940]  Yeah, we're 51 minutes in.
[52:02.940 --> 52:03.940]  Go ahead, what were we going to say?
[52:03.940 --> 52:06.700]  Would you throw maybe a box fan on the floor?
[52:06.700 --> 52:08.500]  I do like a box fan on the floor.
[52:08.500 --> 52:09.540]  Super low speed.
[52:10.860 --> 52:12.500]  If you're on a budget, the box fan is awesome.
[52:12.500 --> 52:13.740]  If you have more of a budget,
[52:13.740 --> 52:15.580]  I would recommend a carbon filter
[52:15.580 --> 52:17.500]  with like a six inch blower on top of it.
[52:17.500 --> 52:19.300]  Just dead sitting in the center of the room,
[52:19.300 --> 52:22.220]  put some ducting off the blower up to the ceiling
[52:22.220 --> 52:23.780]  and just move that air from the floor
[52:24.300 --> 52:25.300]  back up to the ceiling
[52:25.300 --> 52:27.580]  and you're picking up CO2 off the ground
[52:27.580 --> 52:30.580]  and putting it back up to fall back down onto your plants.
[52:30.580 --> 52:31.420]  Nice.
[52:31.420 --> 52:33.420]  Yeah, and that's just differences in budgets.
[52:33.420 --> 52:35.740]  If you've got a low, if you've got 30 bucks, buy a fan.
[52:35.740 --> 52:38.460]  If you got 160, buy a blower and a filter.
[52:38.460 --> 52:40.940]  Just kind of, or I guess it's going to be closer to 260.
[52:40.940 --> 52:43.740]  I guess that blower is going to be 120, 130.
[52:43.740 --> 52:44.580]  Your filters are going to be-
[52:44.580 --> 52:46.820]  Man, my things got expensive.
[52:46.820 --> 52:50.660]  You know, I've watched everything escalate in price
[52:50.660 --> 52:53.260]  since I've been expanding my grows
[52:53.780 --> 52:55.580]  and since Colorado has been getting more popular,
[52:55.580 --> 52:57.660]  everything has just gone up in price
[52:57.660 --> 52:59.580]  and it's not even a competitive raise,
[52:59.580 --> 53:01.900]  it's a gouging raise and I can see it.
[53:01.900 --> 53:03.580]  They know what we're doing.
[53:03.580 --> 53:07.980]  I, man, remember buying a light in like 2002?
[53:09.180 --> 53:10.660]  And keeping your head down at the store,
[53:10.660 --> 53:11.700]  trying not to be noticed?
[53:11.700 --> 53:14.620]  Man, I swear I paid like five, 600 bucks
[53:14.620 --> 53:15.900]  for my first light setup
[53:15.900 --> 53:19.220]  and it's just a magnetic 400 watt,
[53:19.220 --> 53:22.700]  like nothing special whatsoever.
[53:23.700 --> 53:26.900]  But everything else I feel like has gotten more expensive.
[53:27.900 --> 53:30.340]  Lighting is the only thing,
[53:30.340 --> 53:32.220]  and actually I guess it's just because
[53:32.220 --> 53:33.820]  there's so many newer options,
[53:33.820 --> 53:37.100]  but basic lighting I feel like has gotten cheaper.
[53:37.100 --> 53:38.900]  Yeah, and more reliable.
[53:38.900 --> 53:41.700]  I remember you'd buy shit and it would just die on you
[53:41.700 --> 53:43.900]  and that stuff seems to last at least a year or two.
[53:43.900 --> 53:46.940]  And if it doesn't, you can take it back.
[53:46.940 --> 53:48.300]  All right, we've gone 52 minutes.
[53:48.300 --> 53:50.380]  My next part is all about hanging up the ballast
[53:50.420 --> 53:52.300]  and electronics and making the board
[53:52.300 --> 53:53.660]  that I like to hang my stuff on.
[53:53.660 --> 53:55.620]  I think I'm gonna leave everybody hanging
[53:55.620 --> 53:58.060]  and we're gonna do that part of the next episode.
[53:58.060 --> 54:01.180]  And I got a trick to help you take better pictures.
[54:01.180 --> 54:02.300]  When you're doing that.
[54:02.300 --> 54:06.940]  Ooh, ooh, Jesse's gonna help us out with some tricks.
[54:06.940 --> 54:08.900]  When can you come back and do another episode, bro?
[54:08.900 --> 54:10.060]  Probably next week.
[54:10.060 --> 54:10.900]  All right.
[54:11.820 --> 54:14.020]  We'll try to get him back for part three
[54:14.020 --> 54:16.820]  of our building our grow room episode.
[54:16.820 --> 54:18.580]  I'm gonna give a huge, huge, super huge shout out
[54:18.580 --> 54:19.860]  to Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[54:20.340 --> 54:22.180]  I know Jesse's here, so I'm kissing his ass a little bit.
[54:22.180 --> 54:23.940]  But seriously, they helped me out a lot.
[54:23.940 --> 54:25.420]  They sponsored this show and without them,
[54:25.420 --> 54:27.180]  I couldn't do some of the things that I do.
[54:27.180 --> 54:29.500]  Do you have any idea when the next growers meeting
[54:29.500 --> 54:30.340]  is gonna be?
[54:30.340 --> 54:34.700]  Yeah, I'm really bad with dates, but I know when it is.
[54:34.700 --> 54:36.860]  He's one of those guys that can build you a freaking farm
[54:36.860 --> 54:39.860]  in 10 minutes, but if you give him math or a calendar,
[54:39.860 --> 54:43.260]  he just gets all this like look on his face of like,
[54:43.260 --> 54:44.100]  can I hit it with the hammer?
[54:44.100 --> 54:44.940]  I'm actually great with math.
[54:44.940 --> 54:46.500]  I just can't ever do my work.
[54:46.620 --> 54:50.380]  I just got a new phone, so.
[54:50.380 --> 54:51.900]  He stepped up into the future.
[54:51.900 --> 54:52.740]  Yeah.
[54:52.740 --> 54:53.860]  So he's looking through his phone to find out
[54:53.860 --> 54:56.460]  when the next growers meeting is
[54:56.460 --> 54:58.340]  at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[54:58.340 --> 54:59.580]  We gather at the back of the shop
[54:59.580 --> 55:00.940]  and we talk about growing.
[55:00.940 --> 55:02.900]  It's gonna be Friday the 21st.
[55:02.900 --> 55:04.940]  Friday the 21st of October?
[55:04.940 --> 55:05.780]  Yeah.
[55:05.780 --> 55:06.620]  November.
[55:06.620 --> 55:07.460]  November.
[55:07.460 --> 55:08.300]  November, because we can't go back in time.
[55:08.300 --> 55:09.140]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:09.140 --> 55:09.980]  Well.
[55:09.980 --> 55:10.820]  Wow.
[55:12.260 --> 55:14.700]  It's my favorite movie ever.
[55:14.700 --> 55:16.100]  Back to the Future trilogy.
[55:17.060 --> 55:18.420]  Back to the Future trilogy.
[55:18.420 --> 55:20.020]  All right guys, I'm gonna have to get free that day
[55:20.020 --> 55:21.020]  no matter what happens,
[55:21.020 --> 55:22.220]  because you guys are all gonna come.
[55:22.220 --> 55:23.220]  Say the date again.
[55:24.180 --> 55:25.420]  November 21st.
[55:25.420 --> 55:26.980]  November 21st, it's a Friday
[55:26.980 --> 55:28.540]  at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[55:28.540 --> 55:30.540]  About 6, 615?
[55:31.540 --> 55:33.060]  Yeah, yeah.
[55:33.060 --> 55:35.140]  We did it four to eight last time
[55:35.140 --> 55:37.260]  and kind of decided the two hours
[55:37.260 --> 55:39.780]  when we were open was kind of lame, so.
[55:39.780 --> 55:40.620]  Okay.
[55:40.620 --> 55:41.860]  That's a little hint there.
[55:41.860 --> 55:44.740]  But I'm not saying anything, but.
[55:44.740 --> 55:45.980]  We're gonna have,
[55:47.940 --> 55:49.020]  I don't know, it's awful.
[55:49.020 --> 55:51.300]  Yeah, no, we're gonna have barbecue pork.
[55:51.300 --> 55:52.620]  We were thinking about doing turkey,
[55:52.620 --> 55:55.340]  but everyone's gonna have plenty of turkey.
[55:55.340 --> 55:56.420]  I don't wanna be that asshole.
[55:56.420 --> 55:57.260]  Oh, that's true.
[55:57.260 --> 55:58.100]  Yeah.
[55:58.100 --> 55:58.940]  That's true.
[55:58.940 --> 56:01.260]  But we're gonna have some good smoked pork
[56:01.260 --> 56:03.700]  from probably my dad will do it.
[56:03.700 --> 56:06.860]  He's been smoking meat for many years.
[56:06.860 --> 56:08.900]  Jesse's dad is a cool son of a bitch.
[56:08.900 --> 56:13.460]  And I am going to get a awesome vegetarian option too.
[56:13.460 --> 56:14.300]  Nice.
[56:14.860 --> 56:15.700]  I would appreciate it.
[56:15.700 --> 56:17.780]  And just for people who need to eat their damn veggies.
[56:17.780 --> 56:19.740]  So everyone eats your veggies.
[56:19.740 --> 56:20.620]  Eat your vegetables, guys.
[56:20.620 --> 56:24.780]  I've been a vegetarian for, oh my God, over 10 years.
[56:24.780 --> 56:26.100]  I can't remember exactly when.
[56:26.100 --> 56:28.860]  I know I was a vegetarian in 2002 for sure.
[56:29.900 --> 56:32.100]  Can't remember before that when I started,
[56:32.100 --> 56:33.700]  but there was an event that happened
[56:33.700 --> 56:35.020]  and one of my friends I hadn't seen in a while
[56:35.020 --> 56:37.300]  made fun of me for being a vegetarian at Bonnaroo.
[56:37.300 --> 56:39.540]  And I remember the first Bonnaroo was 2002.
[56:39.540 --> 56:41.020]  So I've been a vegetarian since then.
[56:41.020 --> 56:43.380]  And since I started eating better,
[56:43.660 --> 56:45.220]  I try to eat a little better and better and better
[56:45.220 --> 56:46.060]  all the time.
[56:46.060 --> 56:48.860]  But the more I take care of my body, the better I feel.
[56:48.860 --> 56:49.700]  It's so great.
[56:49.700 --> 56:50.540]  So eat your vegetables, guys.
[56:50.540 --> 56:51.380]  That's a not a-
[56:51.380 --> 56:53.260]  Don't eat as much meat.
[56:53.260 --> 56:57.740]  Even if you do eat meat, America eats way, way too much of it.
[56:57.740 --> 56:58.620]  And try to eat food.
[56:58.620 --> 57:01.900]  Quit eating like food product,
[57:01.900 --> 57:04.060]  like processed shit that kind of resembles food.
[57:04.060 --> 57:04.900]  You don't want that.
[57:04.900 --> 57:05.740]  You want food.
[57:05.740 --> 57:07.660]  If it's got like 17 ingredients in it,
[57:07.660 --> 57:08.820]  that's not food anymore.
[57:08.820 --> 57:11.420]  Yeah, look for the fewer ingredients
[57:11.460 --> 57:13.460]  and the easier they are to pronounce.
[57:13.460 --> 57:15.220]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:15.220 --> 57:19.700]  All those ooktoses and extoses and oodle-a-mates-ins.
[57:19.700 --> 57:21.940]  None of that shit is good for you.
[57:21.940 --> 57:23.020]  All right, we're kind of rambling now.
[57:23.020 --> 57:25.380]  How about we wrap up a podcast
[57:25.380 --> 57:27.700]  and we'll look forward to talking to you guys
[57:27.700 --> 57:29.860]  in about seven days.
[57:29.860 --> 57:30.860]  Where's the end?
[57:30.860 --> 57:32.860]  I've got that thing I read at the end of the show
[57:32.860 --> 57:34.100]  and I can't find it, guys.
[57:34.100 --> 57:35.580]  What am I going to do?
[57:35.580 --> 57:36.420]  I'm going to have to ad-lib.
[57:36.420 --> 57:37.260]  I think I saw it.
[57:37.260 --> 57:38.460]  There's the paper I need.
[57:38.460 --> 57:40.460]  All right, guys, don't forget to follow Jesse
[57:40.460 --> 57:41.580]  on Instagram and Twitter.
[57:41.580 --> 57:43.340]  It's at jessegrowsog on Twitter.
[57:43.340 --> 57:45.340]  It's jessegrows on Instagram.
[57:45.340 --> 57:47.940]  Make sure you follow iregenetics on Instagram.

[57:50.660 --> 57:52.180]  Instagram, and Facebook.
[57:52.180 --> 57:53.500]  That's a lot of demands.

[57:54.540 --> 57:56.020]  I'll quit begging.

[57:57.260 --> 57:59.060]  Yes, open up your,
[57:59.060 --> 58:00.900]  we need to get some like really cool tone.
[58:00.900 --> 58:02.900]  Open up your phone and follow us.
[58:02.900 --> 58:03.740]  Let me see.
[58:03.740 --> 58:08.740]  Hey, I want to give a shout out to Yeti OG.
[58:09.380 --> 58:11.060]  That's just an awesome strain.
[58:12.780 --> 58:17.140]  I got some Yeti in middle of week five and it is fire.
[58:17.140 --> 58:17.980]  It looks great.
[58:17.980 --> 58:19.580]  That's my favorite new strain
[58:19.580 --> 58:21.460]  that I got my hands on this year.
[58:23.260 --> 58:24.100]  We'll see.
[58:24.100 --> 58:25.300]  Well, I haven't run the glue yet.
[58:25.300 --> 58:26.140]  I'm getting close to it.
[58:26.140 --> 58:27.780]  I've got them next to each other in a room.
[58:27.780 --> 58:31.860]  There's cookies, Yeti, sour diesel, grateful dog,
[58:31.860 --> 58:35.220]  two gorilla glues, and then two platinum OGs all in a row.
[58:35.220 --> 58:36.940]  So that's like my stellar row.
[58:36.940 --> 58:37.780]  Yeah, I'm like, ooh,
[58:37.780 --> 58:39.740]  let's see what these girls do next to each other.
[58:39.740 --> 58:40.940]  They're all getting fed the same thing.
[58:40.940 --> 58:42.300]  They're all under the same two lights.
[58:42.300 --> 58:43.140]  We'll see what they do.
[58:43.140 --> 58:44.980]  And they're in seven gallon pots.
[58:44.980 --> 58:45.980]  I'm getting excited.
[58:47.020 --> 58:49.380]  Just recently, I got to chuck pollen,
[58:49.380 --> 58:51.580]  took a grateful dog mail and threw his pollen
[58:51.580 --> 58:53.460]  all over a bunch of sexy ladies.
[58:53.460 --> 58:55.980]  So about January, nature's green remedies
[58:55.980 --> 58:57.020]  will be stocked up.
[58:58.540 --> 58:59.420]  Yeah.
[58:59.420 --> 59:00.980]  All right, now that the show's over,
[59:00.980 --> 59:03.580]  go to iTunes and or Stitcher, search for iGrow Culture,
[59:03.580 --> 59:05.780]  find the review section, give me a five-star rating.
[59:05.780 --> 59:06.860]  After that, type in a comment
[59:06.900 --> 59:08.780]  and let me know what you think of the podcast.
[59:08.780 --> 59:11.740]  And I will read your comments on a future episode.
[59:11.740 --> 59:13.260]  Big thanks to all the guys that have left comments.
[59:13.260 --> 59:14.100]  I appreciate that.
[59:14.100 --> 59:15.980]  The guys and gals that have left comments.
[59:15.980 --> 59:17.500]  I do appreciate that.
[59:17.500 --> 59:20.060]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher,
[59:20.060 --> 59:23.980]  and every episode is available on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[59:23.980 --> 59:26.460]  Yes, I have been slacking off on putting videos on YouTube,
[59:26.460 --> 59:28.020]  but I will catch up pretty soon.
[59:28.020 --> 59:29.820]  I've been having too much fun lately.
[59:29.820 --> 59:31.300]  Went to Garden of the Gods with my friend
[59:31.300 --> 59:32.700]  and had a great time.
[59:32.700 --> 59:34.220]  Just enjoyed life for a couple of days.
[59:34.220 --> 59:35.060]  I'm sorry.
[59:35.060 --> 59:35.900]  I'll get back on track.
[59:35.900 --> 59:36.780]  Don't worry.
[59:37.580 --> 59:38.540]  I want to give a huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[59:38.540 --> 59:40.340]  I want to send an extra special thanks to Jesse
[59:40.340 --> 59:41.700]  for coming to all these episodes.
[59:41.700 --> 59:42.540]  It's really cool.
[59:42.540 --> 59:43.380]  Thanks a lot, bro.
[59:43.380 --> 59:44.220]  No problem.
[59:44.220 --> 59:45.060]  I enjoy it.
[59:45.060 --> 59:45.900]  I'm having fun.
[59:45.900 --> 59:46.860]  He's getting good at it, isn't he, guys?
[59:46.860 --> 59:48.700]  You can tell he's so much more comfortable now.
[59:48.700 --> 59:51.300]  I'll sit in here like Larry King with a pen in my hand.
[59:51.300 --> 59:53.620]  We can get you some suspenders, bro.
[59:53.620 --> 59:54.460]  That'd be dope.
[59:54.460 --> 59:56.100]  Hijack my dad's closet.
[59:56.100 --> 59:57.420]  There we go.
[59:57.420 --> 59:58.260]  All right, guys.
[59:58.260 --> 59:59.100]  Thanks again for listening.
[59:59.100 --> 01:00:01.740]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:02.580]  Hey, baby.
[01:00:21.150 --> 01:00:22.390]  Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:23.910]  Welcome.
[01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:25.430]  It's time for episode number 40 of the I Grow Culture
[01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:26.270]  podcast.
[01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:27.310]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[01:00:27.310 --> 01:00:29.190]  Joining me at the table again is our good buddy, Jesse.
[01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:30.030]  How you doing, bro?
[01:00:30.030 --> 01:00:31.230]  Pretty good.
[01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:34.150]  How's it going out there, podcast land?
[01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:36.510]  Podcast land, internet world.
[01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:37.710]  Hopefully you guys are listening to us
[01:00:37.710 --> 01:00:39.510]  while you're driving to work or playing in the garden
[01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:41.550]  or doing something fun.
[01:00:41.550 --> 01:00:43.190]  Whatever you're doing, I hope you got a dab
[01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:46.070]  or a fat joint or a bowl of something super dank.
[01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:48.510]  We're smoking some live resin, some bounty killer,
[01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:49.590]  or no, not bounty killer.
[01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:51.470]  It's, oh, it is bounty killer live resin.
[01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:52.310]  No, it's not.
[01:00:53.110 --> 01:00:53.950]  Sorry, I just lied.
[01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.950]  It's Cable 10 live resin.
[01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:57.350]  Stuff is tasty.
[01:00:57.350 --> 01:00:58.910]  Good, big shout out to the dude that grew it.
[01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:59.750]  What's up, Ryan?
[01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.590]  Nice work.
[01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:01.630]  And an extra special shout out to the guy
[01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:03.430]  that blasted, extracted it for us.
[01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:05.590]  This stuff is super tasty.
[01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:09.070]  Who would imagine that the iRegenetics guy
[01:01:09.070 --> 01:01:12.030]  would have all those iRegenetics dabs sitting over there?
[01:01:12.030 --> 01:01:13.310]  Dude, it's really nice to see-
[01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.510]  Can't even keep them straight.
[01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:15.710]  Yeah, true.
[01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:18.470]  It's really nice to watch my friends grow my genetics
[01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:22.190]  and then to have one of our good brothers extract it for us.
[01:01:23.030 --> 01:01:24.150]  And then he gets his hash back and he calls me,
[01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:25.590]  dude, come over and get some of this hash
[01:01:25.590 --> 01:01:27.110]  I just had made from your strains.
[01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:29.470]  I'm like, hell yeah, I'm on my way.
[01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:31.510]  I got a nice gram of heart of gold.
[01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:34.150]  There was grateful dog and there was Cable 10 live resin.
[01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.590]  And dude, that was tasty stuff.
[01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:39.310]  It left a, I keep saying citronella candles
[01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.950]  sort of scent in the room.
[01:01:40.950 --> 01:01:43.150]  If you're into that, that was a great smell.
[01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:45.590]  Guys, I want to take one quick second
[01:01:45.590 --> 01:01:46.790]  and give a huge shout out.
[01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:47.990]  I always do this at the end of the show,
[01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:49.870]  but we got to do a special shout out.
[01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.070]  Extra special shout out to my ninja Spence.
[01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.230]  Spence has been sick as hell.
[01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:56.150]  We found out just recently that his appendix
[01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:59.470]  had ruptured inside of him and he had to have it removed.
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:01.470]  Dude, I'm so glad you're on the way to recovery.
[01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:02.790]  We were super worried about you.
[01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.710]  I was stressing out, worried about my brother.
[01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:06.590]  I love you more than you ever will realize.
[01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:08.350]  So big shout out to Spence, dude.
[01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:11.150]  Everybody send your love and energy to getting Spence better.
[01:02:11.150 --> 01:02:12.150]  Get better, buddy.
[01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:13.150]  Come on, feller.
[01:02:13.150 --> 01:02:13.990]  Yeah, buddy, get up.
[01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:14.870]  You got to shoot some hoops.
[01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:16.190]  You got to make some hash.
[01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.710]  Spence is going to win the secret cup finals in Vegas.
[01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:21.070]  I'm confident.
[01:02:21.070 --> 01:02:22.470]  Minus an appendix.
[01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:25.590]  Can he fly cheaper?
[01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:26.550]  He just lost some weight.
[01:02:26.550 --> 01:02:27.390]  Oh, no shit.
[01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:28.430]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.430 --> 01:02:30.670]  Isn't your appendix only like about an inch long anyway?
[01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:32.030]  Yeah, I actually looked it up today.
[01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:33.110]  That thing almost killed him.
[01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:33.950]  It almost killed him.
[01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:35.550]  I'm pretty sure he was pretty bad shape.
[01:02:35.550 --> 01:02:38.510]  And it's almost, it's completely worthless.
[01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:39.910]  Somebody asked me, what does your appendix do?
[01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:41.470]  And I looked at him and said, I don't know.
[01:02:41.470 --> 01:02:43.270]  It's full of a poison vial.
[01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:44.110]  That's what it does.
[01:02:44.110 --> 01:02:45.630]  That's an awesome thing to do.
[01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:47.510]  Let's just stick this inside of a human
[01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:49.710]  and wait for it to rupture one day.
[01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:50.790]  Good job, creator.
[01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:53.510]  That's the self-destruct switch he gave us all, I guess.
[01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:54.510]  I guess so.
[01:02:54.510 --> 01:02:56.790]  Also, since we're sending out love and energy
[01:02:56.790 --> 01:02:57.870]  to people that need some help,
[01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:00.030]  I want to send a big, huge healing vibe
[01:03:00.030 --> 01:03:01.550]  to my good friend, Angela.
[01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:02.910]  She hasn't been feeling well the past week.
[01:03:02.910 --> 01:03:04.910]  She's got some medical things going on
[01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:05.750]  that's kind of private to her,
[01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:06.570]  so we don't need to elaborate.
[01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.590]  But dude, send a lot of healing vibes to Angela.
[01:03:09.590 --> 01:03:10.550]  Big shout out to Angela.
[01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.390]  Care a lot about you.
[01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:12.230]  I want you better.
[01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:13.430]  I want to see you smiling again.
[01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:14.270]  Hey, what's up guys?
[01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:15.830]  I have to jump in and do a disclaimer.
[01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.230]  I played the shout out for Angela.
[01:03:17.230 --> 01:03:18.910]  And when she heard it, she said that I made it sound
[01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:20.910]  like there's something wrong with her vagina.
[01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:23.710]  I need to assure you, there's absolutely nothing wrong
[01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:25.470]  with Angela's vagina.
[01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:26.790]  Let's get back to the show.
[01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:29.990]  Yeah, let's get off the somber vibe and get into a show.
[01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:31.190]  I do owe another shout out.
[01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:32.630]  Two more shout outs.
[01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:35.190]  Dude, I owe a shout out to the man Afro Man.
[01:03:35.190 --> 01:03:38.510]  I got to hang out with this dude, Afro Man.
[01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:40.790]  He sings that song, Because I Got High.
[01:03:40.790 --> 01:03:43.190]  He played a show in a town near me.
[01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:45.990]  There's a little VIP party at a dispensary called The Spot.
[01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.190]  Shout out to The Spot.
[01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:48.030]  What's up, Robert?
[01:03:48.030 --> 01:03:48.870]  What's up, Vegas?
[01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:50.750]  Hope you guys are listening to the show.
[01:03:50.750 --> 01:03:52.430]  Shout out to everyone at The Spot.
[01:03:52.430 --> 01:03:54.310]  They got me to see Afro Man.
[01:03:54.310 --> 01:03:56.070]  Got a couple of photos with Afro Man.
[01:03:56.070 --> 01:03:57.150]  It was actually Angela's fault.
[01:03:57.150 --> 01:03:58.070]  She works there.
[01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.470]  She got me the little VIP hookup.
[01:03:59.470 --> 01:04:00.790]  So thanks again, Angela.
[01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:01.630]  Super shout out.
[01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:05.790]  I walked in and Afro Man was taking pictures with people
[01:04:05.790 --> 01:04:07.950]  and doing a little quick private meet and greet.
[01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:10.550]  And he saw me and he goes, oh shit, come here, my man.
[01:04:10.550 --> 01:04:12.430]  And he took pictures with me.
[01:04:12.430 --> 01:04:14.470]  He posted my photos up on his Instagram.
[01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:15.510]  I thought it was kind of funny.
[01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.350]  Awesome.
[01:04:16.350 --> 01:04:17.190]  Yeah, he blew off a lot of people
[01:04:17.190 --> 01:04:19.070]  to come hang out with Rasta Jeff for some reason.
[01:04:19.070 --> 01:04:19.950]  Fuck yeah.
[01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:22.430]  The owners of The Spot said that he could come smoke
[01:04:22.430 --> 01:04:25.110]  with me, but he probably would not make it to his show.
[01:04:25.110 --> 01:04:27.550]  So he opted to not smoke with me.
[01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:29.270]  He was like, you look like you might murder me
[01:04:29.270 --> 01:04:30.110]  with some smoke.
[01:04:30.110 --> 01:04:31.470]  So yeah, he didn't want to do that.
[01:04:31.470 --> 01:04:33.510]  Yeah, well, and then you're also, yeah.
[01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.390]  At a dispensary and unfortunately,
[01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:39.070]  not allowed to smoke at a dispensary.
[01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.550]  They totally knew I was gonna drive him off in my car.
[01:04:41.550 --> 01:04:42.390]  We didn't talk.
[01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:43.230]  Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.070]  Yeah, we were gonna do that.
[01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:46.390]  Had you just been able to hand him a joint,
[01:04:46.430 --> 01:04:47.550]  it would have been a lot easier.
[01:04:47.550 --> 01:04:50.470]  You know, he did do a show in Colorado Springs after that.
[01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:52.270]  So we can't talk about what happened.
[01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:56.070]  All right, I want to talk about a couple other things too.
[01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:56.910]  Shout outs are done.
[01:04:56.910 --> 01:04:58.150]  Shout out to everybody that's listening to the show.
[01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:59.150]  Dude, this is episode 40.
[01:04:59.150 --> 01:05:01.230]  We made it 40 episodes, bro.
[01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.070]  This is getting good.
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:03.870]  I promise you guys, the episodes are getting better.
[01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:05.710]  I've been doing more preparation.
[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:06.690]  Been doing more planning.
[01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.270]  I've got the next few episode topics already listed
[01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.450]  of what I'm gonna do.
[01:05:11.430 --> 01:05:12.610]  Coming up in a couple of episodes,
[01:05:12.610 --> 01:05:14.990]  we're gonna do an episode about nutrients.
[01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:16.550]  I've had a couple of people ask me,
[01:05:16.550 --> 01:05:17.470]  tell me about nutrients.
[01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:21.270]  What does all this NPK 539 on my bottles,
[01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:22.510]  what does this shit mean?
[01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:23.590]  What should I be feeding?
[01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:24.670]  What do I need?
[01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:25.990]  So we're gonna cover that.
[01:05:27.110 --> 01:05:32.070]  And also our friend, Ross Cola, King Cola, Sean,
[01:05:32.070 --> 01:05:33.590]  is gonna come be on the show.
[01:05:34.550 --> 01:05:35.590]  I haven't called him yet,
[01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:37.070]  but he did send me his phone number.
[01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:38.630]  I've got his phone number so I could text him
[01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:39.870]  and ask him to be on the show.
[01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:40.710]  Fuck yeah.
[01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:42.190]  He hypes a growing system
[01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.670]  that he has labeled organic as fuck.
[01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:46.190]  And I'm kind of impressed.
[01:05:46.190 --> 01:05:47.010]  I've been growing for quite a while
[01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.830]  and he has the approach that I hope to get to.
[01:05:49.830 --> 01:05:51.430]  I'm not where he is yet.
[01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:53.470]  He's got a very environmentally friendly,
[01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:56.670]  environmentally sustainable way of growing.
[01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:57.590]  And it's kind of impressive.
[01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:58.410]  I'm impressed.
[01:05:58.410 --> 01:06:00.430]  And it takes a little bit to impress me.
[01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:05.430]  Yeah, he does these fermentations that look delicious.
[01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:07.950]  You know, I would almost,
[01:06:07.950 --> 01:06:09.070]  if I didn't know what was in there,
[01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:10.390]  some of that stuff would look tasty.
[01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:11.790]  Yeah, yeah, no, they really do.
[01:06:11.790 --> 01:06:14.470]  And it smells good because of the molasses.
[01:06:15.230 --> 01:06:16.070]  All right, we'll let Sean tell you about his stuff
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:16.890]  when we get him on the show.
[01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:19.750]  So shout out to Ras Cola, King Cola, and Organic as Fuck.
[01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:21.950]  We'll get him on here pretty soon.
[01:06:21.950 --> 01:06:22.870]  And guys, I'm saying that for her,
[01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:24.150]  but it doesn't cost money anymore.
[01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:25.990]  And I'm actually quoting this guy's brand.
[01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:27.630]  So you can't charge me on that one.
[01:06:27.630 --> 01:06:29.110]  Something you can charge me for.
[01:06:29.110 --> 01:06:32.190]  This podcast is brought to you by Highly Educated Titanium.

[01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.990]  They're cheap for a damn reason.
[01:06:44.990 --> 01:06:46.290]  It's not titanium.
[01:06:46.290 --> 01:06:49.470]  You want grade two titanium because it's the most,
[01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:51.270]  like I can read you off the website.

[01:07:37.870 --> 01:07:39.350]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[01:07:39.350 --> 01:07:41.350]  Do you have any deals this month, bro?
[01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:44.830]  We still got the roots, 707 for 25 bucks.
[01:07:44.830 --> 01:07:45.670]  Nice.
[01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:50.150]  Mentioned the Hygro Culture Podcast for commercial pricing.
[01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.890]  I went there today and she had no problem
[01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:53.410]  typing in commercial pricing for me.
[01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:55.830]  I got myself a bag of soil for my seedlings.
[01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.010]  It was nice and easy.
[01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.950]  Dude, can I tell them what they'll pay for that bag of,
[01:07:59.950 --> 01:08:00.790]  what did I get there?
[01:08:00.790 --> 01:08:01.610]  Is that light warrior?
[01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:02.790]  Yeah.
[01:08:02.790 --> 01:08:04.390]  That bag was less than 18 bucks.
[01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:06.670]  It was $17 and some change for that bag.
[01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:08.630]  Usually that's a $25 bag of dirt.
[01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:10.470]  So we saved, I saved eight bucks
[01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:12.070]  just by using or by telling them,
[01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:13.790]  hey, I listened to the Hygro Culture Podcast.
[01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:14.630]  Damn.
[01:08:14.630 --> 01:08:16.150]  Yeah, so go get yourself a bag of soil, dude.
[01:08:16.150 --> 01:08:16.970]  It was really cool.
[01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:17.810]  It was really easy.
[01:08:17.810 --> 01:08:18.910]  They didn't even, you know when you get a discount
[01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:20.390]  some places they act like you're a dick.
[01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:22.070]  She's like, don't I owe you pricing?
[01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:23.170]  And I was like, yes, you do.
[01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:25.030]  You do give me a deal.
[01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.870]  So make sure you tell them
[01:08:25.870 --> 01:08:27.670]  that you're listening to the Hygro Culture Podcast
[01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.870]  and also check out their website, hygrodenver.com.
[01:08:30.870 --> 01:08:31.990]  Pretty sure.
[01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:33.470]  I didn't write it down because I thought I remembered
[01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:34.710]  and apparently I just forgot.
[01:08:34.710 --> 01:08:36.110]  Yeah, hygrodenver.com.
[01:08:36.110 --> 01:08:41.110]  I think we also have hygro.us.
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:42.230]  Okay.
[01:08:42.230 --> 01:08:44.310]  And they also have Hygro Pueblo has a Facebook.
[01:08:44.310 --> 01:08:45.150]  If you're in Pueblo
[01:08:45.150 --> 01:08:47.150]  and you wanted to team up on their Facebook, check it out.
[01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:48.830]  Cause they post a lot of cool stuff on there.
[01:08:48.830 --> 01:08:50.830]  We have an Instagram too.
[01:08:52.530 --> 01:08:54.990]  Getting around to using it a little more.
[01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:56.910]  It's hard to keep up with all the social media, isn't it?
[01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:57.750]  Yeah.
[01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:58.590]  Yeah.
[01:08:58.590 --> 01:08:59.410]  Well, especially like,
[01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.950]  I don't know how to Instagram be in a shop.
[01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:02.790]  It feels weird.
[01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.870]  Right, take pictures of products
[01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:07.430]  in front of the store and this is what's on sale.
[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:08.270]  Yeah.
[01:09:08.270 --> 01:09:09.710]  We're going to start doing some cool stuff.
[01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:12.990]  We ordered a grow tent for the store.
[01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.830]  Sweet.
[01:09:13.830 --> 01:09:14.670]  So you can set that up.
[01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:15.490]  Yeah.
[01:09:15.490 --> 01:09:16.330]  We're going to show how to work it.
[01:09:16.330 --> 01:09:17.150]  Get some stuff going.
[01:09:17.150 --> 01:09:17.990]  Yeah.
[01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:22.990]  So, and then we've got the next growers meeting next Friday.
[01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:24.990]  I believe we've got a horrible Friday.
[01:09:24.990 --> 01:09:25.910]  The 21st.
[01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:26.750]  Yeah.
[01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:27.570]  Yes.
[01:09:27.570 --> 01:09:28.410]  The 21st.
[01:09:28.410 --> 01:09:29.250]  It's the day after my mama's birthday.
[01:09:29.250 --> 01:09:30.070]  So happy birthday, mama.
[01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:31.550]  You don't listen to the podcast, but whatever, dude.
[01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:32.430]  It's the thought that counts.
[01:09:32.430 --> 01:09:37.430]  We got a bunch of freebies coming.
[01:09:37.630 --> 01:09:39.070]  Already have some.
[01:09:39.070 --> 01:09:40.350]  Dude, I got hooked up last time.
[01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:41.630]  I got a couple of little gifts last time.
[01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:42.470]  Oh, that's nice.
[01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:43.950]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:48.950]  So we're going to go over cloning and seeding in person.
[01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.990]  That'll be really helpful.
[01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:50.910]  Yeah.
[01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:51.990]  Beans and houseplants.
[01:09:51.990 --> 01:09:53.430]  So don't get your hopes up too much.
[01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:54.710]  I was going to say, are you able to,
[01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:57.430]  can we clone a cannabis plant in there?
[01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:58.630]  I think we could.
[01:09:58.630 --> 01:10:01.110]  But we could just take a plant that looks just like cannabis
[01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:02.310]  and teach them how to do it and it'll work.
[01:10:03.150 --> 01:10:03.990]  Yeah.
[01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:04.830]  Okay.
[01:10:04.830 --> 01:10:05.650]  Be safe.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.490]  Yeah.
[01:10:06.490 --> 01:10:07.310]  We like that hydro shop, so let's not risk it.
[01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:08.150]  That's where I go to get my gear for cheap.
[01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:08.990]  Yeah.
[01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.910]  Also guys, this podcast is brought to you
[01:10:09.910 --> 01:10:11.750]  by our friends at treethugger.com.
[01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:12.590]  Treethugger.com.
[01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:13.870]  Everyone asks me, what is that?
[01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:14.910]  It's a cool name.
[01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:16.150]  Go look at it, right?
[01:10:16.150 --> 01:10:16.990]  Yeah.
[01:10:16.990 --> 01:10:19.110]  It's mostly concert and festival news and reviews
[01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.950]  is what it is.
[01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.350]  They talk about all the concerts that come to Red Rocks.
[01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:25.110]  If you listen to stuff like the String Cheese, Fish,
[01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:28.310]  Galactic, The Grateful Dead, Soundtribe Sector 9,
[01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:31.030]  the Disco Biscuits, even if you're into like Boombox
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:34.030]  and Bassnecker is who I'm trying to think of.
[01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:34.870]  That's not my thing, sorry.
[01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:37.450]  I'm more of a Fish, Grateful Dead, Reggae kind of a kid,
[01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:39.790]  but I check it out because I want to know when Fish is coming
[01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:41.270]  and what the cheese is up to.
[01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:43.510]  So treethugger.com will keep you up to date
[01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:45.270]  with all of your hippie news.
[01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:49.230]  I like to say, look out at the cookout with treethugger.com.
[01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:51.790]  Every time you say String Cheese incident,
[01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:53.190]  I think of Richard Cheese.
[01:10:53.190 --> 01:10:56.270]  I love that dude.
[01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:57.630]  That's a great band, Richard Cheese.
[01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:58.910]  If you guys haven't listened to Richard Cheese,
[01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:01.790]  he does popular songs in a lounge style.
[01:11:01.790 --> 01:11:02.790]  It's pretty chill.
[01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:05.110]  Does some Rage Against the Machine, all big band style.
[01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:06.190]  Lounge against the machine.
[01:11:06.190 --> 01:11:08.470]  Lounge against the machine, all right.
[01:11:08.470 --> 01:11:11.470]  Usually I would take this time to read comments on Facebook
[01:11:11.470 --> 01:11:13.750]  or on Stitcher and iTunes, but I haven't gotten
[01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:15.190]  any new comments.
[01:11:15.190 --> 01:11:17.750]  Big thanks to the people, oh God, sorry, I got loud.
[01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:19.710]  Big thanks to the people that did leave comments.
[01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:21.850]  If you want to leave some comments on iTunes and Stitcher,
[01:11:21.850 --> 01:11:22.690]  I will read them.
[01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:24.870]  I'll also check out the comments on Facebook.
[01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:26.630]  There is an Instagram page, but like Jesse said,
[01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:29.390]  I don't Instagram a lot because it's a podcast.
[01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:30.870]  I can take pictures of Jesse and me
[01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:31.790]  and I can post them up.
[01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:34.930]  Other than that, not a lot to post.
[01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:38.510]  All right, so we're going to talk more about,
[01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:40.190]  I want to make sure I covered all the intro stuff.
[01:11:40.190 --> 01:11:41.030]  I did.
[01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:42.030]  It's a good place to leave questions though.
[01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:43.630]  I'll say that much.
[01:11:43.630 --> 01:11:46.550]  I look at every now and then, make sure there's no,
[01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:47.390]  you know.
[01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:48.210]  On the Instagram?
[01:11:48.210 --> 01:11:49.050]  Yeah.
[01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:49.890]  Oh yeah, I try so hard to answer
[01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.390]  all of the questions I get.
[01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.270]  Since they shut down, Facebook shut down
[01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.310]  the iRegenetics Facebook page and took it
[01:11:55.310 --> 01:11:56.910]  from an interactive page and made it
[01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.670]  to just a business page, which I find boring.
[01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:02.230]  So I've gotten a lot of spare time to check Instagram
[01:12:02.230 --> 01:12:03.550]  and stuff like that lately.
[01:12:03.550 --> 01:12:05.390]  I don't really mess around that much on those Facebooks.
[01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:06.810]  They do check them to answer your questions,
[01:12:06.810 --> 01:12:09.630]  but I don't really play there like I used to.
[01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:11.510]  They kind of pissed me off taking my page down like that
[01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:13.550]  without even talking to me.
[01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:14.390]  Dicks.
[01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:17.790]  All right, so we've been doing grow lessons,
[01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:18.630]  teaching you guys.
[01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:20.190]  We're trying to sort of stoner style,
[01:12:20.190 --> 01:12:22.270]  teach you guys how to set up a grow room for yourself
[01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:23.910]  so that you can be self-sufficient.
[01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:25.230]  We've gotten the room built.
[01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:27.870]  We talked about the best places to do it.
[01:12:27.870 --> 01:12:29.670]  We gave you a good guide.
[01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:31.710]  So far, we've got a room built with lights hanging,
[01:12:31.710 --> 01:12:35.150]  but we haven't hung our ballasts yet and our timers.
[01:12:35.150 --> 01:12:36.710]  So that's kind of where we are.
[01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:39.190]  If you guys need to catch up, I'll take a pause
[01:12:39.190 --> 01:12:40.830]  and you can go listen to the two episodes before this
[01:12:40.830 --> 01:12:42.190]  and you can catch up to where we are.
[01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:43.350]  Pausing.
[01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:44.190]  All right, we're back now.
[01:12:44.190 --> 01:12:46.210]  I hope you listened to those and learned a whole shit ton.
[01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:47.390]  We didn't really pause that long.
[01:12:47.390 --> 01:12:49.590]  I should have paused longer because I need a drink.
[01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:52.590]  There's another chance.
[01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.390]  Oh, editing is fun.
[01:12:58.390 --> 01:12:59.830]  I don't even edit these shows anymore.
[01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:01.150]  I just put them out the way they go.
[01:13:01.150 --> 01:13:01.990]  I like the flow.
[01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:04.030]  It's way better when we're just high doing our thing.
[01:13:04.030 --> 01:13:06.910]  All right, so we've got this big 10 by eight by eight.
[01:13:06.910 --> 01:13:08.270]  Yeah, we built an eight by eight room.
[01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:10.290]  You've got your poly wrapped around everything.
[01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:11.310]  It's all sealed up.
[01:13:11.310 --> 01:13:12.710]  You got your lights hanging.
[01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:16.670]  Now, what I would like to do is show you the,
[01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:19.710]  not show you, tell you the way I hang my ballasts
[01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:20.590]  and my electronics.
[01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:22.190]  And Jesse and I have a lot of different ideas.
[01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:23.230]  So this will get fun.
[01:13:24.110 --> 01:13:26.550]  I use a piece of plywood to mount all of the electronics
[01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:27.550]  in one area.
[01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:29.190]  At Lowe's or whatever hardware store,
[01:13:29.190 --> 01:13:31.110]  they actually sell a pre-cut board.
[01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:34.950]  I think it's 24, it may be 18 inches by 36 inches.
[01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:37.510]  You can screw that right onto the wall and you can hang.
[01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:39.870]  I can fit four, I can fit five ballasts
[01:13:39.870 --> 01:13:42.190]  and my power box on that.
[01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:44.750]  And so all of the ballasts are plugged in to the power box
[01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:46.470]  and it's also screwed to the board.
[01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:48.110]  I screwed the board to the framing on the outside
[01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.490]  of the grow room to keep the heat down.
[01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:52.390]  Jesse was talking about, if you put it on the inside,
[01:13:52.390 --> 01:13:53.710]  keep it close to the door.
[01:13:53.710 --> 01:13:55.550]  The outside is ideal because if something goes wrong,
[01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:58.710]  you don't have to go in there to turn everything off.
[01:13:58.710 --> 01:14:01.710]  Also keep a fire extinguisher near that box.
[01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.410]  That's something that I recommend.
[01:14:04.630 --> 01:14:06.550]  You don't wanna have to run into the grow room.
[01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:07.470]  Keep a smoke alarm in there.
[01:14:07.470 --> 01:14:08.950]  If there is a fire, you don't wanna have to go
[01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:11.250]  halfway through the room to get to your fire extinguisher.
[01:14:11.250 --> 01:14:13.350]  You wanna have it outside, kick the door open
[01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:15.630]  and start spraying and put out fire.
[01:14:15.630 --> 01:14:16.910]  That's your biggest fear,
[01:14:16.910 --> 01:14:18.950]  but we gotta be prepared for that.
[01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:21.030]  So you got this board, you got four ballasts.
[01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:22.910]  I put a power box on there
[01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:24.710]  because that's how I plug everything in.
[01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:25.550]  Screwed to the wall.
[01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:26.990]  That's the safest way to do it too.
[01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:28.270]  Yeah, I like those power boxes.
[01:14:28.270 --> 01:14:29.590]  They're really reliable.
[01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:30.550]  They don't pay me to say that.
[01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:31.390]  I buy them straight up.
[01:14:31.390 --> 01:14:32.230]  Made in America.
[01:14:32.230 --> 01:14:33.470]  Made in America, yes.
[01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:35.630]  I was gonna ask you, here's a random side note.
[01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:37.510]  What ballasts are made in America?
[01:14:37.510 --> 01:14:38.350]  Do you know?
[01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:41.350]  I can find out.
[01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:43.630]  You can Google that while I read on for a second.
[01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:47.670]  It's almost time for me to buy several more ballasts
[01:14:47.670 --> 01:14:49.590]  and I would like to buy American-made products
[01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:54.510]  because I noticed that the, what the hell brand is that?
[01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:57.030]  The Quantums that used to be made in Germany,
[01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:58.330]  now they come with a made in China
[01:14:58.330 --> 01:15:00.070]  or a made in Korea sticker on them
[01:15:00.070 --> 01:15:01.830]  and they smell funny now.
[01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:04.270]  And also I've noticed that the fans don't last as long.
[01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:06.310]  They start shitting out really quickly now.
[01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:07.470]  So I don't wanna buy those anymore.
[01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:08.670]  Those used to be my go-tos
[01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:11.990]  because they don't fail like a NextGen does.
[01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:13.590]  A NextGen will just shit out on you.
[01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:16.310]  It'll try to start up and fail just starting.
[01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:17.510]  You can't start properly.
[01:15:17.510 --> 01:15:18.350]  I don't want you.
[01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:21.470]  I actually have a 400 watt NextGen right now I'm using.
[01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:22.310]  I have a 400.
[01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.230]  I need to replace my 400 watt NextGen
[01:15:24.230 --> 01:15:25.110]  because it took a shit on me.
[01:15:25.110 --> 01:15:26.590]  I'm running a 600 in that room now
[01:15:26.590 --> 01:15:28.710]  just because I don't wanna go buy that 400.
[01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.430]  We actually, we were trying,
[01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:33.950]  they're kind of hard to find nowadays.
[01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:34.790]  The 400?
[01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:35.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:36.470]  Everyone's going bigger.
[01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:37.310]  Yeah.
[01:15:37.310 --> 01:15:38.150]  Yes.
[01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:39.950]  I like to keep my males under a 400 and flower
[01:15:39.950 --> 01:15:41.470]  just because you can just keep them flowering
[01:15:41.470 --> 01:15:44.390]  and you don't need to run all that much light.
[01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:45.990]  If you're just doing a pheno hunt for boys.
[01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:47.550]  How many people pheno hunt for males?
[01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:48.590]  If you're pheno hunting for males,
[01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:50.150]  you're probably not listening to this show.
[01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:53.030]  You're beyond everything we've said so far.
[01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:54.470]  You should be hanging out at the table right here.
[01:15:54.470 --> 01:15:55.670]  If you're pheno hunting for males,
[01:15:55.670 --> 01:15:57.230]  you're invited, send me a message.
[01:15:57.230 --> 01:15:58.070]  We'll find you.
[01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:59.510]  Igrowcultureathotmail.com.
[01:15:59.510 --> 01:16:02.990]  We're just strategizing about that very subject.
[01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:04.590]  Yeah.
[01:16:04.590 --> 01:16:05.830]  Dude, can we talk about that?
[01:16:05.830 --> 01:16:06.670]  Yeah, go for it.
[01:16:06.670 --> 01:16:08.630]  I'm getting really excited about it.
[01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:09.470]  Me too.
[01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:10.510]  I'm IryGenetics, of course.
[01:16:10.510 --> 01:16:11.830]  I'm Rasta Jeff from IryGenetics.
[01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:13.710]  I've been running IryGenetics for a couple few years now.
[01:16:13.710 --> 01:16:14.550]  It's been public.
[01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:15.990]  Seeds have been available.
[01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:18.230]  I cannot keep up with the demand for my product.
[01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:21.230]  I've got enough breeding space to breed plenty of seeds,
[01:16:21.230 --> 01:16:23.350]  but when they go on sale at Nature's Green Remedies,
[01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:25.190]  they sell out in like 48 hours.
[01:16:25.190 --> 01:16:26.510]  Yeah, I've noticed.
[01:16:26.510 --> 01:16:28.990]  So our good buddy, Jesse, has stepped up to the plate.
[01:16:28.990 --> 01:16:30.750]  And now I think Jesse will,
[01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:33.670]  I'm gonna run a bunch of his shit as soon as it's done.
[01:16:33.670 --> 01:16:35.190]  And when I see that his stuff does good,
[01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.510]  we're gonna add him to our lineup.
[01:16:36.510 --> 01:16:38.110]  He'll be part of team IryGenetics.
[01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.110]  He'll be another breeder.
[01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:40.510]  He'll be our second breeder.
[01:16:41.550 --> 01:16:43.030]  Tripod Farms.
[01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:44.590]  Tripod Farms.
[01:16:44.590 --> 01:16:46.270]  I'm excited to get him in there.
[01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:48.150]  But pretty soon, stuff that Jesse bred
[01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:51.550]  will be available through the IryGenetics catalog.
[01:16:51.550 --> 01:16:52.390]  It'll be sweet.
[01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:53.830]  Got some Kim dog stuff coming
[01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:58.830]  and some OG flavorful stuff coming.
[01:16:59.750 --> 01:17:01.110]  I like the T's.
[01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:02.070]  I like the T's.
[01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:04.990]  I just hit, on Halloween,
[01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:08.550]  I put Grateful Dog pollen on a Platinum OG female
[01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:10.270]  and on a Sour Diesel female.
[01:17:10.270 --> 01:17:11.710]  And I've never pollinated those
[01:17:11.710 --> 01:17:12.990]  with the Grateful Dog before.
[01:17:13.030 --> 01:17:15.590]  So we'll have Platinum Dog and Sour Dog.
[01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:17.870]  Nice, I got that same Sour you have.
[01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:18.710]  Nice, that's a great color, man.
[01:17:18.710 --> 01:17:20.390]  I was thinking about throwing that out there,
[01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:22.470]  you know, dusting him up a little too.
[01:17:22.470 --> 01:17:24.430]  Because it's a great spray.
[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:25.550]  It's stanky.
[01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.510]  It just doesn't grow with the vigor that I want.
[01:17:28.510 --> 01:17:30.350]  I want a heartier, thicker plant.
[01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:32.110]  Top it, top the shit out of that thing.
[01:17:32.110 --> 01:17:33.070]  That's what you gotta do.
[01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:34.590]  It's got good yield for a plant
[01:17:34.590 --> 01:17:36.990]  that normally exhibits that trait, though.
[01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:38.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:17:38.190 --> 01:17:40.510]  And flower her early because, man, that thing's too soft.
[01:17:40.510 --> 01:17:41.830]  Dude, I learned the hard way.
[01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:43.110]  It doesn't keep up with Gorilla Glue.
[01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:44.590]  My Gorilla Glue has tripled in size
[01:17:44.590 --> 01:17:45.910]  since I started flowering.
[01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:46.750]  Nice.
[01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:48.630]  Did you find me an American-made ballast?
[01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:53.310]  No, I'm not finding, I don't suspect the Galaxies are.
[01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:57.990]  I know Sunlight, a lot of their products
[01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:59.110]  are made in America.
[01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:02.590]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:03.430]  We'll keep going on that.
[01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:05.550]  If you guys have an idea of a good American-made ballast,
[01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:07.390]  let me know, because it's for me, I'm shopping.
[01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:08.590]  I need a lot of them.
[01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:09.630]  Oh, man, you know what?
[01:18:09.670 --> 01:18:12.710]  Actually, I think I know of one.
[01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:14.310]  It's a really expensive one.
[01:18:14.310 --> 01:18:16.390]  Are they the Gavitas or the?
[01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:18.150]  No, those would be made in Holland.
[01:18:18.150 --> 01:18:19.110]  Yeah, that's what I thought.
[01:18:19.110 --> 01:18:20.750]  What's the Gavitas competitor?
[01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:21.710]  The E-Paps?
[01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:23.510]  E-Paps, I believe those are China.
[01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:24.350]  China.
[01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:25.710]  And so are the NanoLux DEs.
[01:18:25.710 --> 01:18:27.430]  I know those are made in China.
[01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:29.390]  Are Lush Lights made in America?
[01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:30.910]  I wonder if Lush Lights are made in America
[01:18:30.910 --> 01:18:32.310]  or if they're made in China.
[01:18:33.670 --> 01:18:36.270]  I would suspect they're made in,
[01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:38.190]  I'd really hope they are.
[01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:41.070]  Oh, Solistech, made in California.
[01:18:41.070 --> 01:18:41.910]  Okay.
[01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:42.950]  Yeah, really good stuff.
[01:18:42.950 --> 01:18:43.790]  Something to check out, guys, Solistech.
[01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:45.910]  Recommended by the Cottonmouth Kings, even.
[01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:50.190]  I thought that was one of the weirdest endorsements
[01:18:50.190 --> 01:18:51.030]  I ever saw in my life.
[01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:52.910]  You recommend these ballasts.
[01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:56.110]  Shouldn't a breeder or somebody endorse that shit?
[01:18:56.110 --> 01:19:00.430]  I suspect that maybe the Hortorlux makes ballasts.
[01:19:00.430 --> 01:19:02.550]  I think maybe their stuff's made in America.
[01:19:02.550 --> 01:19:03.390]  Okay.
[01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:05.670]  I wanna buy American-made ballasts, guys.
[01:19:05.670 --> 01:19:07.070]  I encourage you to also.
[01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:09.230]  So I take this board that I bought at Lowe's
[01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:13.030]  and I put the board on the floor and I mount my ballast.
[01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.870]  I don't screw it to the floor.
[01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:15.110]  I set it on the floor so I can work.
[01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:16.150]  Let me be clear about that.
[01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:17.470]  I set the board on the floor
[01:19:17.470 --> 01:19:19.990]  and then I screw the ballasts to the board
[01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:22.110]  and then I screw my power box to the board.
[01:19:22.110 --> 01:19:23.430]  And now this board is movable.
[01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:26.230]  You can hang your ballast damn near anywhere you want.
[01:19:26.230 --> 01:19:28.310]  Bolt that to where it's convenient for you.
[01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:30.150]  If it's outside of the room is what I would prefer
[01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:31.030]  because then you're keeping heat out.
[01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.710]  Those ballasts get hot.
[01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:33.550]  Do it outside of the room
[01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:36.630]  and then you can mess with your timers and stuff
[01:19:37.190 --> 01:19:39.190]  and not be in the room so that it's just easier.
[01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:40.430]  So bolt that wherever you need,
[01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:41.710]  screw that wherever you need to the framing,
[01:19:41.710 --> 01:19:44.190]  then run that wiring through a small hole in the poly
[01:19:44.190 --> 01:19:46.550]  and tape over it to keep the light from leaking.
[01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:49.190]  So now you've got air in, air out, lights, and power.
[01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:52.390]  You're probably gonna need to cool down the room.
[01:19:52.390 --> 01:19:54.950]  An air conditioner is definitely what you're gonna need.
[01:19:54.950 --> 01:19:57.150]  You may need a dehumidifier.
[01:19:57.150 --> 01:19:59.190]  So take another small board
[01:19:59.190 --> 01:20:02.910]  and put your air conditioner thermostat on there.
[01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:06.470]  If you have one that doesn't attach to the air conditioner,
[01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:09.430]  you can plug your air conditioner into a temperature sensor
[01:20:09.430 --> 01:20:10.750]  and hang that on the wall.
[01:20:11.670 --> 01:20:14.310]  And then when the temperature gets to a certain thing,
[01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.590]  to the certain temperature during the,
[01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:17.790]  you can set the day and night temperature.
[01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:20.310]  And then that little meter will tell the air conditioner
[01:20:20.310 --> 01:20:21.470]  when to come on and when to go off.
[01:20:21.470 --> 01:20:23.430]  And you can do that with almost any piece of equipment
[01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:24.510]  in your room.
[01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:28.350]  You can automate your dehumidifier, your air conditioner.
[01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:29.750]  You can automate your fans.
[01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:33.310]  In one room, I've got an emergency shutdown switch.
[01:20:33.310 --> 01:20:35.550]  If it hits over 95 degrees in that room,
[01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:37.390]  everything turns off, everything.
[01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:38.350]  Even the air conditioners,
[01:20:38.350 --> 01:20:39.910]  because I don't know what's causing the problem.
[01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:41.070]  So everything just shuts off
[01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:43.190]  and the ambient temps are only gonna be 70 something
[01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:45.390]  in that area anyway, when there's no light.
[01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:49.910]  Automation, put all your automation stuff on one board
[01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:51.590]  and put that where it's visible.
[01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:54.070]  Put a thermometer, a hygrometer on there.
[01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:56.110]  All this stuff that you wanna be able to see,
[01:20:56.110 --> 01:20:57.830]  sometimes that has to be inside the room.
[01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:59.190]  So put that in the room if you have to.
[01:20:59.190 --> 01:21:00.470]  If you can get the,
[01:21:00.470 --> 01:21:01.590]  if you want that outside of the room,
[01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.270]  it'll be more expensive, trust me.
[01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:05.750]  That one will probably have to go in the room.
[01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.510]  So just put all your stuff onto one board
[01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:10.310]  and nail it to one spot up high where you can see it.
[01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:13.350]  A random side note, when you're building a grow room
[01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:15.230]  and you're thinking about planning a grow room,
[01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:18.590]  think of water goes low, electrical goes high.
[01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:20.230]  You want your water low on the ground.
[01:21:20.230 --> 01:21:22.110]  If you have a bucket, if you've got a reservoir,
[01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.030]  there's no need to lift that up off the ground too high.
[01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:26.870]  Keep it low because if it does topple over,
[01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:28.670]  you don't want it to spill on your electronics,
[01:21:28.670 --> 01:21:31.110]  which should be kept above waist high.
[01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:33.350]  I don't run conduit along the wall
[01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:34.910]  lower than about 36 inches.
[01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:36.070]  That's my waist.
[01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:37.630]  I actually believe that's code.
[01:21:39.390 --> 01:21:40.470]  Yeah, pretty sure.
[01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:42.510]  Okay, yeah, well that makes sense.
[01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:44.110]  But these guys aren't, they're just building a room.
[01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:47.670]  So we gotta keep water low, electricity high
[01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:48.910]  because you don't wanna pour water
[01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:50.590]  into your electricity ever.
[01:21:50.590 --> 01:21:52.390]  Keep your cords organized, you guys.
[01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:54.910]  I've seen so many messes of grow rooms.
[01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.550]  Keep them as short as possible.
[01:21:56.550 --> 01:21:58.270]  Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna trim this mic up.
[01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:59.110]  Sorry, cool.
[01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.990]  No worries, it kinda tipped.
[01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:01.070]  We got impotent on us.
[01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:05.230]  And put a smoke alarm and fire detector
[01:22:05.230 --> 01:22:06.070]  where you can get to them.
[01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.910]  The smoke alarm in the room,
[01:22:06.910 --> 01:22:08.110]  the fire detector outside of the room.
[01:22:08.110 --> 01:22:10.590]  Those are little side notes that I wrote.
[01:22:10.590 --> 01:22:12.630]  So you're gonna need air conditioning
[01:22:12.630 --> 01:22:14.190]  is what I wrote down next.
[01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:16.310]  I follow the general rule of 3,000 BTUs
[01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:19.190]  of air conditioning per 1,000 watt light.
[01:22:19.190 --> 01:22:21.110]  If you wanna use those traditional ACs
[01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.510]  you can put in the window, that do go in a window,
[01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:25.270]  you can cut a hole in the poly
[01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:27.150]  and mount the AC to the framing.
[01:22:27.150 --> 01:22:28.990]  But that's gonna heat up whatever room
[01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:30.910]  you dumped the AC exhaust into.
[01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:33.910]  If you're in a garage or an unused basement, that's cool.
[01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:35.950]  But you can't heat up, like if you're-
[01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:37.270]  You have to exhaust that heat up.
[01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:38.150]  It's gotta go somewhere
[01:22:38.150 --> 01:22:39.470]  or it's just gonna continue to heat up.
[01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:40.510]  Yeah, you can run it,
[01:22:40.510 --> 01:22:41.990]  a lot of people run it straight through the chimney
[01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:43.310]  if you got one.
[01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:45.550]  I've seen it go into the attic if you need to.
[01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:46.710]  If you guys are in illegal states
[01:22:46.710 --> 01:22:48.070]  you're gonna have to plan this a little better
[01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:49.030]  because your heat signature
[01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:51.510]  is what they're gonna look for to bust you, I think.
[01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:54.950]  I've heard they have to have a warrant for that
[01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:57.110]  but I'm no lawyer.
[01:22:57.910 --> 01:23:00.630]  And it's also 2014, almost 15,
[01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:02.550]  where the cops can do just about whatever they want.
[01:23:02.550 --> 01:23:03.510]  This is true too.
[01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:05.950]  We are living in a police state.
[01:23:05.950 --> 01:23:07.510]  They'll just fly over with that camera.
[01:23:07.510 --> 01:23:09.230]  They'll say, oh, look, all that bright light.
[01:23:09.230 --> 01:23:10.470]  And then they'll just send a car
[01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:11.550]  to go sit in front of your house
[01:23:11.550 --> 01:23:13.710]  and then they'll notice some shit.
[01:23:13.710 --> 01:23:16.750]  The cops are the worst gang that we have nowadays.
[01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:18.630]  The worst criminals on the damn streets.
[01:23:18.630 --> 01:23:21.230]  On the air conditioners, if it's going to outside,
[01:23:21.230 --> 01:23:24.350]  a lot of them, if the air conditioner's in your room
[01:23:24.350 --> 01:23:25.990]  and it's in an outside window,
[01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:28.670]  light shines through.
[01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:29.510]  Yes.
[01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:33.350]  You can take a can of spray paint,
[01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:37.030]  get you, I can't remember how I did it,
[01:23:37.030 --> 01:23:39.790]  but there's some way you can get a nozzle on there
[01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:44.590]  that you can stick a little straw in, like WD-40.
[01:23:44.590 --> 01:23:47.150]  I was gonna say the WD-40 straw, yeah, perfectly.
[01:23:48.070 --> 01:23:52.190]  And spray the white foam inside the vents
[01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:54.030]  with black spray paint.
[01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.430]  And it's all clean and everything.
[01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:56.270]  It'll stop your reflective.
[01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:57.830]  It just stops the light from coming out.
[01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:58.990]  Good idea.
[01:23:58.990 --> 01:23:59.990]  Good idea.
[01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:01.590]  And if you're putting that in the-
[01:24:02.590 --> 01:24:04.590]  I picked that up from Subcool, actually.
[01:24:05.870 --> 01:24:07.030]  Shout out to Subcool.
[01:24:08.270 --> 01:24:09.390]  So I didn't brag about this.
[01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:11.510]  I posted a really sweet picture to Instagram the other day
[01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:13.430]  and Subcool actually sent me a message
[01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:15.310]  that said we should collab.
[01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:17.870]  So in the future, there could be some TGA,
[01:24:17.870 --> 01:24:19.310]  iRegenetics stuff happening.
[01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:21.750]  But right now I'm gonna focus on what I'm doing with Jesse
[01:24:21.750 --> 01:24:23.430]  because I know that's for real.
[01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:24.910]  And I know you can trust Jesse.
[01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:26.590]  I don't know anybody else out there.
[01:24:27.670 --> 01:24:28.510]  What else?
[01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:31.950]  I'm really honored for that too.
[01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:35.990]  Oh, dude, you're like the first person I thought of.
[01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:38.110]  For sure. Yeah, for sure.
[01:24:38.110 --> 01:24:39.750]  Fuck, I had something else I wanted to say
[01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.310]  before we got sidetracked.
[01:24:41.310 --> 01:24:44.270]  The black spray paint on the air conditioner.
[01:24:45.350 --> 01:24:46.790]  Keeping light out.
[01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:48.310]  Yeah, shit, keep going.
[01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:49.350]  Okay.
[01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:51.590]  I like to use the, and they take more energy,
[01:24:51.590 --> 01:24:53.830]  but I like those air conditioners on wheels.
[01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:54.670]  They have a little duct.
[01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:56.630]  You can just duct it right out of a six inch duct.
[01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:58.270]  It works perfect.
[01:24:58.270 --> 01:24:59.110]  Those are glorious.
[01:24:59.110 --> 01:25:02.750]  They take a little more electricity, but they're awesome.
[01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:05.030]  Also you need maybe a fan speed controller.
[01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:07.790]  Those are always helpful.
[01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:10.790]  There's always a reason to add a fan speed controller.
[01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:12.870]  I bought a little thermostat thing
[01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:14.310]  to turn off my air cool fans
[01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:16.350]  when it gets too cold outside.
[01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:20.230]  I walked out to the room the other day
[01:25:20.230 --> 01:25:22.910]  and there's 4,000 watt lights burning.
[01:25:23.910 --> 01:25:28.910]  And normally, it's 72, 68 degrees in there.
[01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:31.790]  It was like 55 degrees.
[01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:33.870]  I shut all the fans off, everything,
[01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:37.070]  and it took most of the light cycle to heat back up.
[01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:38.310]  Wow.
[01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:39.590]  I'm loving this wind.
[01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:41.150]  It was negative six degrees here
[01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:42.670]  the other night where we live.
[01:25:42.670 --> 01:25:43.750]  Very fucking cold.
[01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:45.390]  That is cold, yeah.
[01:25:45.390 --> 01:25:48.710]  My air conditioners aren't on in any of my grows right now.
[01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.270]  And I'm confident that that's okay.
[01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.070]  I've turned all of the air conditioners off.
[01:25:52.110 --> 01:25:55.070]  Just let that, I'm saving some electricity right now.
[01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:56.190]  A lot of electricity.
[01:25:56.190 --> 01:25:57.710]  Yeah.
[01:25:57.710 --> 01:25:58.830]  We heat with wood.
[01:26:00.190 --> 01:26:03.750]  And yeah, I've gone through an insane amount of firewood
[01:26:03.750 --> 01:26:04.910]  in the last three days.
[01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:05.750]  Wow.
[01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:06.590]  Yeah.
[01:26:08.230 --> 01:26:11.830]  Probably 300, 400 pounds, shit, I don't even know.
[01:26:11.830 --> 01:26:15.030]  You build your girls to where there are a lot of work.
[01:26:15.030 --> 01:26:16.990]  I'm that guy that automates as much as I can
[01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.830]  so that I do not-
[01:26:17.830 --> 01:26:19.230]  Oh, I'm just talking about my house.
[01:26:19.230 --> 01:26:20.550]  Oh, just the house, holy shit.
[01:26:20.550 --> 01:26:21.670]  Yeah. Okay.
[01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:25.110]  I don't automate any of my waterings.
[01:26:25.110 --> 01:26:26.270]  I feel that I need to be in there
[01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:28.510]  watering the plants by hand myself.
[01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:29.390]  That's when I touch them.
[01:26:29.390 --> 01:26:31.990]  I move every pot when I water.
[01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.910]  I touch every plant.
[01:26:32.910 --> 01:26:35.550]  I look at, I'll pull off a leaf off of almost every plant
[01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:37.470]  and look at the bottom, look for a bug.
[01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:38.910]  Like I'm anal in the room.
[01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:42.350]  I've got like a ritual that I go through in there every day.
[01:26:42.350 --> 01:26:45.310]  You know, like, no, you can't bug me until this is done
[01:26:45.310 --> 01:26:47.590]  or everything will go wrong.
[01:26:47.590 --> 01:26:49.030]  I have to love this room.
[01:26:49.030 --> 01:26:50.990]  But I automate almost everything else I can.
[01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:52.990]  Of course, your light cycles, your air conditioning,
[01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:55.990]  your dehumidifier, your CO2, all that stuff.
[01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:57.790]  And the new rules that they're trying to propose here
[01:26:57.790 --> 01:27:01.470]  in Pueblo, Colorado, they want to ban CO2 augmentation.
[01:27:01.470 --> 01:27:02.310]  What?
[01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:03.310]  Yeah, that's one of the stupid things
[01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:04.190]  they wrote in the rules.
[01:27:04.190 --> 01:27:05.790]  So we'll talk about that more in the future,
[01:27:05.790 --> 01:27:07.430]  but that just came up in my head.
[01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:08.270]  Yeah.
[01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:09.390]  Pueblo, Pueblo, Pueblo.
[01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:11.070]  Right, right, clown shoes.
[01:27:11.070 --> 01:27:11.910]  Yeah.
[01:27:11.910 --> 01:27:12.750]  Clown shoes, guys.
[01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.510]  Size 55, triple E.
[01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:16.670]  Yes.
[01:27:17.590 --> 01:27:20.870]  So yeah, you got your, I hope that made sense.
[01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:22.910]  So we just mounted the ballast right to a board.
[01:27:22.910 --> 01:27:24.350]  Then we put the board right up on the wall
[01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:25.430]  and then you got to run all the cables.
[01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:26.270]  That's the part I skipped.
[01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.670]  Make sure when you push the cables together,
[01:27:27.670 --> 01:27:28.670]  make sure you push them tight.
[01:27:28.670 --> 01:27:29.510]  All the way.
[01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:31.670]  All the way tight, because when that shit's loose,
[01:27:31.670 --> 01:27:33.390]  that's electricity that's live right there
[01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:34.710]  just being exposed.
[01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:37.230]  I want to design, I've made them myself.
[01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:39.310]  I just bend them all up, but out of wire,
[01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:41.750]  but I do a safety wire too.
[01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:42.590]  Yeah.
[01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:43.430]  To hold it all together.
[01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:45.470]  When I was in bands, I learned to tie cords
[01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:47.150]  that are connected together in that knot,
[01:27:47.150 --> 01:27:48.830]  where if you pull instead it tightens the knot
[01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:50.070]  instead of them coming apart.
[01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:51.470]  I like that move a lot.
[01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:53.910]  I used to be a roadie and a musician.
[01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:55.350]  Back in the seventies, man.
[01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:59.070]  I talked about a tip on pictures.
[01:27:59.070 --> 01:28:01.510]  And since we're talking about running cords,
[01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:02.350]  here it is.
[01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:06.310]  The cord that runs from the ballast to the light
[01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:08.870]  is what causes all the bars in your picture.
[01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:10.910]  So the shorter those are,
[01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:14.830]  and the neater they're hung and everything,
[01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:18.390]  the less bars and shit you'll have coming up on your screen.
[01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:19.710]  You know, on some cameras.
[01:28:20.230 --> 01:28:21.830]  Cause it's the magnetic that causes that.
[01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:22.670]  Yeah. Okay.
[01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:24.670]  I think.
[01:28:24.670 --> 01:28:25.510]  That's a good tip.
[01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:26.350]  I didn't know that.
[01:28:26.350 --> 01:28:27.190]  I can't remember.
[01:28:28.630 --> 01:28:30.830]  I didn't really care about it when I set up my new room.
[01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:34.150]  But I think if you keep all the cords
[01:28:34.150 --> 01:28:35.830]  away from each other too,
[01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:40.470]  individually instead of tied together on the ceiling.
[01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:41.310]  Okay.
[01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:42.150]  Yeah. Well, yeah, that makes sense.
[01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:42.990]  Because that's also better for the light too.
[01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:44.870]  Way more of that signal all at once.
[01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:45.990]  That would make sense.
[01:28:47.510 --> 01:28:49.510]  I wrote down so much stuff on so many different papers.
[01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.190]  I'm looking for them all.
[01:28:52.310 --> 01:28:54.510]  Too many different things on too many papers.
[01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:55.510]  That looks way professional.
[01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:56.350]  I'm trying dude.
[01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:57.190]  I'm trying.
[01:28:57.190 --> 01:28:58.350]  Looks like Howard Stern.
[01:28:59.790 --> 01:29:00.630]  Hey now.
[01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.910]  Can I get sued for that?
[01:29:02.910 --> 01:29:04.470]  That's like his fucking trademark.
[01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:05.310]  Screw that man.
[01:29:05.310 --> 01:29:06.150]  Sorry, Howard.
[01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:07.350]  I didn't mean to steal your trademark.
[01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:09.710]  That was a, that was flattery is what that was.
[01:29:10.630 --> 01:29:11.470]  All right.
[01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:13.150]  So we've got this room mostly figured out.
[01:29:13.150 --> 01:29:13.990]  We got lights hung.
[01:29:13.990 --> 01:29:15.550]  We've got all of our automation set up.
[01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.390]  Hopefully we got air going in.
[01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:18.230]  We got air going out.
[01:29:18.230 --> 01:29:19.590]  We've got an air conditioner.
[01:29:19.590 --> 01:29:21.110]  Now that you got most of everything set up
[01:29:21.110 --> 01:29:22.950]  you got your pond liner on the floor.
[01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:27.350]  I would add four, four by four tables.
[01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:29.790]  I use, and I don't want to say brands
[01:29:29.790 --> 01:29:32.470]  but I use the Hydro Farm four by four white flood tables.
[01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:33.870]  Cause they're perfect.
[01:29:33.870 --> 01:29:34.710]  Those are perfect.
[01:29:34.710 --> 01:29:36.270]  I like to raise them up off the ground.
[01:29:36.270 --> 01:29:38.550]  I like the white botanic care trays.
[01:29:38.550 --> 01:29:40.630]  You can find someone to make you a stand for them
[01:29:40.630 --> 01:29:42.270]  or you can put them on buckets.
[01:29:42.270 --> 01:29:45.310]  Those, those tables that they sell are so damn expensive.
[01:29:45.310 --> 01:29:46.990]  Don't buy the tables that are prefab
[01:29:46.990 --> 01:29:50.470]  unless you're looking to look like you got a pro room.
[01:29:50.470 --> 01:29:53.070]  And just straight up Hydro store guy here.
[01:29:53.070 --> 01:29:54.830]  Most of those tables are bullshit.
[01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:57.750]  The big foot table.
[01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:58.590]  Yeah.
[01:29:58.590 --> 01:30:00.390]  I was going to say the big foot table is just stuck together
[01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:01.630]  with little plastic pegs.
[01:30:01.630 --> 01:30:03.190]  It can fall over so easily.
[01:30:03.190 --> 01:30:04.310]  They're ridiculous.
[01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:05.230]  Yeah.
[01:30:05.230 --> 01:30:07.270]  The reason I like the tables and the trays
[01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:09.190]  I like to get the plants up off the ground.
[01:30:09.190 --> 01:30:10.950]  The floor gets too cold.
[01:30:10.950 --> 01:30:11.790]  Yeah.
[01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:12.630]  When you lift them up off the ground
[01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:14.310]  do you get a more regulated temperature?
[01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:16.030]  I feel like you can get a little more airflow
[01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:17.390]  and I'm six foot five, dude.
[01:30:17.390 --> 01:30:18.910]  Having plants down on the ground.
[01:30:18.910 --> 01:30:21.110]  I have to get on my knee to get down to the soil
[01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:22.790]  to see what's happening at the soil level
[01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:24.190]  or the bottom foliage.
[01:30:24.190 --> 01:30:25.750]  Lifting them up off the ground two feet.
[01:30:25.750 --> 01:30:27.190]  Now they're in my face.
[01:30:27.190 --> 01:30:28.030]  They're right where I want them
[01:30:28.030 --> 01:30:30.590]  and I don't have to squat all day.
[01:30:30.590 --> 01:30:32.550]  I like that better too.
[01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:34.630]  You get to see a lot more of what's going on too.
[01:30:34.630 --> 01:30:35.470]  Yeah.
[01:30:35.470 --> 01:30:37.190]  It's just, I feel, you know, you know this way more.
[01:30:37.190 --> 01:30:38.270]  For sure.
[01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:39.670]  And this is that, that's kind of,
[01:30:39.670 --> 01:30:40.910]  it depends on how much space you have
[01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:42.030]  and how big a plant you want to grow.
[01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:44.230]  If you're growing seven gallon pots
[01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:45.390]  and you're putting them on a table
[01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:47.070]  and now you're going to have a seven foot tall plant,
[01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:49.670]  maybe you might be in, so you got to plan ahead.
[01:30:49.670 --> 01:30:50.790]  But the four by four tables,
[01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:53.030]  you can fit four, seven gallon pots
[01:30:53.030 --> 01:30:54.750]  or nine or 12, three gallon pots.
[01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.670]  You can, they're perfect for one light worth of stuff.
[01:30:57.670 --> 01:30:59.470]  If you're in a legal state and you got the numbers
[01:30:59.470 --> 01:31:00.950]  and you're going to do hydro,
[01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:04.110]  you can do 64, those little six inch rockwool cubes
[01:31:04.110 --> 01:31:05.230]  and just put a clone in there
[01:31:05.230 --> 01:31:07.350]  and veg them for like a week and flower it in there.
[01:31:07.350 --> 01:31:09.110]  Dude, I've seen people pull a pound and a half
[01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:10.470]  off of 64 little clones,
[01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:12.670]  veg for a week and a half on a table like that.
[01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:14.150]  64 little nugs.
[01:31:14.150 --> 01:31:14.990]  Yep.
[01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:16.350]  Isn't that a-
[01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:18.030]  Seven grams each or something.
[01:31:18.030 --> 01:31:19.470]  The Cali connection.
[01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:21.310]  That's how, totally how Swerve does it.
[01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:22.710]  Recipe to success or whatever he calls it.
[01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:23.550]  Fast track to success.
[01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:24.390]  Yeah, fast track to success.
[01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:25.230]  Shout out to Swerve.
[01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:26.070]  What up Swerve?
[01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.910]  That's my homie.
[01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:28.830]  Well, I haven't heard much from that guy in a while.
[01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:30.430]  You know, he has been,
[01:31:30.430 --> 01:31:33.190]  social media kind of killed everybody.
[01:31:33.190 --> 01:31:34.350]  Facebook went and,
[01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:35.710]  the Facebook Nazi police went
[01:31:35.710 --> 01:31:37.390]  and made everybody use our real names.
[01:31:37.390 --> 01:31:39.910]  Now when I scroll through, I don't even know anybody.
[01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:41.630]  Except Goma.
[01:31:42.710 --> 01:31:43.550]  What the hell?
[01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:44.590]  How'd you pull that off, dude?
[01:31:45.190 --> 01:31:47.270]  Here's the trick guys.
[01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:49.230]  If you are a,
[01:31:49.230 --> 01:31:50.270]  a drag queen,
[01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:51.670]  and I know that's not the appropriate word,
[01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:52.950]  but I don't know the appropriate word anymore.
[01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:55.310]  I'm not politically correct in the drag queen scene.
[01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:57.830]  That's my cousin's one, yeah.
[01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:59.270]  All right, well if you're a drag queen,
[01:31:59.270 --> 01:32:00.630]  you can email Facebook and say,
[01:32:00.630 --> 01:32:02.910]  I'm a drag queen and this is my alter ego.
[01:32:02.910 --> 01:32:06.390]  And they will allow you to use your fake name.
[01:32:06.390 --> 01:32:07.230]  Wow.
[01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:08.070]  Yeah.
[01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.910]  Huh.
[01:32:08.910 --> 01:32:10.150]  That probably won't work anymore
[01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:12.030]  after a couple of days that this show is out
[01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.870]  and people try it,
[01:32:12.870 --> 01:32:13.710]  but that's worked for,
[01:32:13.710 --> 01:32:15.190]  that's why a lot of the people that,
[01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:16.630]  like in the cannabis community,
[01:32:17.510 --> 01:32:19.190]  handmade, they're still Richard,
[01:32:19.190 --> 01:32:21.550]  or they're still handmade instead of Adam Hand.
[01:32:22.830 --> 01:32:23.670]  Yeah.
[01:32:23.670 --> 01:32:25.790]  A lot of people got to keep their shit.
[01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:27.190]  That's random.
[01:32:27.190 --> 01:32:28.510]  Yeah.
[01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:31.230]  I know a bunch of drag queens would like to know that.
[01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:34.030]  They all had to put their real names up.
[01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.910]  Oh, that sucks.
[01:32:34.910 --> 01:32:35.750]  Yeah.
[01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:37.550]  Well, because now instead of being Simone LaRue,
[01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:40.750]  it's Michael Witt.
[01:32:40.950 --> 01:32:42.110]  No, not Witt.
[01:32:42.110 --> 01:32:42.950]  No, I'm sorry.
[01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:43.790]  I had to try.
[01:32:43.790 --> 01:32:44.630]  I had to try.
[01:32:44.630 --> 01:32:45.470]  I know who your dad is.
[01:32:45.470 --> 01:32:46.310]  I should shut my mouth.
[01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:47.150]  What's up, Mr. Witt?
[01:32:47.150 --> 01:32:47.990]  Hope to see you at the Grover's meeting,
[01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.830]  November 21st at High Grow Indoor Growing Supplies.
[01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:49.670]  It's going to be awesome.
[01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:50.510]  I will be there.
[01:32:50.510 --> 01:32:51.350]  Rasta Jeff will be there.
[01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:52.190]  Also that night,
[01:32:52.190 --> 01:32:53.030]  here's a random plug.
[01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:54.350]  Joe Rogan's new comedy special comes out on Comedy Central,
[01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:55.190]  the night of the 21st at midnight.
[01:32:55.190 --> 01:32:56.030]  So I'm going to leave High Grow Indoor Growing Supplies
[01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:56.870]  and I'm going to come home
[01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:57.710]  and I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:32:57.710 --> 01:32:58.550]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:32:58.550 --> 01:32:59.390]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:32:59.390 --> 01:33:00.230]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:00.790 --> 01:35:01.630]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:01.630 --> 01:35:03.050]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:03.050 --> 01:35:04.070]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.910]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:05.750]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:06.670]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:06.670 --> 01:35:07.490]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:08.490]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:08.490 --> 01:35:09.390]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:09.390 --> 01:35:10.230]  I'm going to get super drunk.
[01:35:10.230 --> 01:35:11.050]  I'm going to be as drunk as I was the night before.
[01:35:11.050 --> 01:35:12.570]  I'm going to be as drunk as I was the night before.
[01:35:12.570 --> 01:35:14.390]  I'm going to be as drunk as I was the night before.
[01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:17.770]  I'm going go, I'm going do this.
[01:35:17.770 --> 01:35:18.610]  I'm going do that.
[01:35:18.610 --> 01:35:19.430]  I'm going do that.
[01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:20.270]  I'm going go, I'm going to do that.
[01:35:20.270 --> 01:35:21.090]  I'm going to punch this face.
[01:35:21.090 --> 01:35:23.390]  helping all my friends out, they're stuck.
[01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:24.830]  I'm like, I got you bro, I'll give you a ride.
[01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:26.190]  I'll give you a ride, I'll give you a ride.
[01:35:26.190 --> 01:35:27.030]  It's kind of nice.
[01:35:27.030 --> 01:35:29.190]  I pulled a chick and her little boyfriend
[01:35:29.190 --> 01:35:30.230]  out the other night.
[01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.070]  Nice.
[01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:32.230]  I have a gigantic truck.
[01:35:32.230 --> 01:35:33.350]  You do, you do have a-
[01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:36.750]  Well, no, it's not one of those diesel fucking
[01:35:38.150 --> 01:35:40.350]  penile issue things.
[01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:43.290]  It's very functional.
[01:35:43.290 --> 01:35:45.470]  It's not classy, it's not pretty,
[01:35:45.470 --> 01:35:46.830]  it's not a chick getting truck.
[01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:48.810]  It's a working man's damn truck.
[01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:50.950]  You can deliver soil anywhere in Pueblo
[01:35:50.970 --> 01:35:52.410]  or anywhere in Colorado in that truck.
[01:35:52.410 --> 01:35:53.250]  Pretty much.
[01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:54.330]  The top of Pike's Peak.
[01:35:54.330 --> 01:35:55.330]  Oh, easily.
[01:35:55.330 --> 01:35:56.650]  Yeah.
[01:35:56.650 --> 01:35:57.650]  Yeah.
[01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:58.490]  All right, we're-
[01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:00.690]  I'd be driving around like Ken Block.
[01:36:00.690 --> 01:36:01.770]  It's how it is around here right now.
[01:36:01.770 --> 01:36:03.170]  It's just slushy.
[01:36:03.170 --> 01:36:05.170]  Just go slow, you guys will be cool.
[01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:07.410]  Seems like nobody's driven in the snow before.
[01:36:07.410 --> 01:36:08.250]  Oh yeah, no.
[01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:09.490]  You guys are in Colorado.
[01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:11.890]  You've done this, it was just a year ago.
[01:36:11.890 --> 01:36:13.650]  Not even that.
[01:36:13.650 --> 01:36:15.210]  All right, guys, we're gonna get back
[01:36:15.210 --> 01:36:16.250]  onto building a grow room.
[01:36:16.250 --> 01:36:17.170]  We're kind of ranting here.
[01:36:17.170 --> 01:36:18.290]  We've had some dabs.
[01:36:18.290 --> 01:36:19.570]  I hope you're taking dabs.
[01:36:19.570 --> 01:36:21.550]  So if you're building a hydro hut,
[01:36:21.550 --> 01:36:23.030]  that's very similar to this setup.
[01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:25.230]  I'd run the ducting for the lights.
[01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:26.390]  There's a couple of ways to do the lights,
[01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:27.630]  but I would run the lights,
[01:36:27.630 --> 01:36:28.870]  the ducting straight through the hut
[01:36:28.870 --> 01:36:31.110]  so that the light heat never makes it into the hut.
[01:36:31.110 --> 01:36:32.590]  There's a hole on the left side
[01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:34.690]  and the right side of the huts at the top.
[01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:37.830]  Hang the blower inside the hut on one side,
[01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:39.510]  run the ducting from the outside,
[01:36:41.070 --> 01:36:42.390]  over the blower, over the light,
[01:36:42.390 --> 01:36:44.470]  and out of the other side.
[01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:46.390]  Yeah, that way the heat, if that makes sense,
[01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:47.550]  you just make a tunnel right through it.
[01:36:47.570 --> 01:36:50.810]  The heat never actually stays inside the grow hut.
[01:36:50.810 --> 01:36:52.410]  There's also a little hole in the roof of the hut.
[01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:53.330]  I had a blower there.
[01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:55.970]  I said roof, just the roof, that's all the top.
[01:36:55.970 --> 01:36:58.050]  I had a blower there to pull fresh air
[01:36:58.050 --> 01:36:59.410]  through the hut constantly.
[01:36:59.410 --> 01:37:01.450]  I put a carbon filter and a blower inside the hut
[01:37:01.450 --> 01:37:03.170]  and fit it out of the top there.
[01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:06.210]  It makes the airflow pull air in from the bottom
[01:37:06.210 --> 01:37:08.210]  and the heat goes out the top.
[01:37:08.210 --> 01:37:10.210]  And always remember that your blower
[01:37:10.210 --> 01:37:12.450]  can pull more air than it can push.
[01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:14.890]  I wrote down a lot of shitty half-ass notes right there.
[01:37:14.890 --> 01:37:16.890]  None of those notes were full sentences.
[01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:20.110]  Blowers work better when they're outside of the room.
[01:37:20.110 --> 01:37:22.510]  It's the same reason you never see the fart fan
[01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:23.350]  in the bathroom.
[01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:25.590]  It's always mounted up in the ceiling.
[01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.070]  It's easier to pull air out than it is to push it out.
[01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:29.370]  Definitely easier to pull.
[01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:31.890]  Here's a question for you.
[01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:34.870]  Do you run a carbon filter in tents
[01:37:34.870 --> 01:37:37.030]  when you're collecting pollen?
[01:37:37.030 --> 01:37:39.990]  You know, I don't because I don't have a blower at all
[01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:41.490]  in my tent where I'm collecting pollen.
[01:37:41.490 --> 01:37:46.490]  I run when, God, dude, this is crazy secret shit right here.
[01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:48.710]  I've got a male that's in full flower right now.
[01:37:48.710 --> 01:37:50.870]  I'm getting ready to do it, so it's a genuine question.
[01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:53.430]  So I've got him in his own three-by-three hut
[01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:56.990]  with one coily CFL in there to keep him awake
[01:37:56.990 --> 01:37:59.070]  and that's all because I can't create any heat
[01:37:59.070 --> 01:38:00.470]  because I don't want to suck the pollen out.
[01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:01.310]  Gotcha.
[01:38:01.310 --> 01:38:03.150]  Yeah, so he's just in there with the CFL.
[01:38:03.150 --> 01:38:06.310]  You can take a peek when we're done if you want.
[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:08.550]  Maybe you don't want to, there's pollen in there.
[01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:09.590]  You'll need a shower.
[01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:12.110]  I've always wondered about,
[01:38:12.110 --> 01:38:13.990]  I'm flowering one under a thousand,
[01:38:14.010 --> 01:38:16.370]  well, I'm flowering a couple under a thousand watt
[01:38:16.370 --> 01:38:19.770]  right now, so I think I might be changing that out
[01:38:19.770 --> 01:38:20.850]  to a different light.
[01:38:20.850 --> 01:38:21.970]  If-
[01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:23.690]  Although I want to see their full.
[01:38:24.810 --> 01:38:26.250]  Here's more shit that I don't tell people.
[01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:28.890]  I take a brown paper bag and put it right over the top cola
[01:38:28.890 --> 01:38:32.970]  and secure it and then when I'm sure that I see him,
[01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:34.330]  when he's nutting a whole bunch,
[01:38:34.330 --> 01:38:35.970]  I just cut that sucker off
[01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:38.610]  and then I have the branch sticking out of the bag
[01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:40.730]  and I'll hold it with my hand around the branch
[01:38:40.730 --> 01:38:42.730]  and pull the branch out of the bag slowly
[01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.990]  and as you pull, you knock everything off into the bag
[01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:46.510]  and you just come out with a stick.
[01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:47.710]  And then you just clean up the-
[01:38:47.710 --> 01:38:49.150]  Yeah, and then I'll clean out all that-
[01:38:49.150 --> 01:38:50.550]  Get the material out of there.
[01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:52.470]  Pour that onto a, I use a drum head actually,
[01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:53.430]  an old drum head.
[01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:55.630]  Flip it upside down and pour all my shit under there.
[01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:56.470]  Bunch of those.
[01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:57.990]  Separate, yeah, I had to put, that's how I got the idea.
[01:38:57.990 --> 01:38:59.990]  I was like, I'm going to repurpose that shit.
[01:38:59.990 --> 01:39:01.230]  But- Nice.
[01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:03.870]  So if you leave those in the hut with that bag over there
[01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:05.150]  with the blower on the top,
[01:39:05.150 --> 01:39:06.750]  it doesn't steal a lot of your pollen
[01:39:06.750 --> 01:39:08.470]  but it does take some, a little bit,
[01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:09.830]  but you're going to make enough.
[01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:11.670]  Let's see, I'm also phenol hunting too.
[01:39:11.690 --> 01:39:12.930]  Right. Just collecting pollen.
[01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:14.770]  Yeah, and I already know that male is who I want
[01:39:14.770 --> 01:39:15.890]  so I just let him sit in there
[01:39:15.890 --> 01:39:17.410]  and just jizz away and collect it.
[01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:18.250]  For sure.
[01:39:18.250 --> 01:39:20.770]  Just circle jerking or bukkake in a bag over there.
[01:39:20.770 --> 01:39:22.170]  Yeah.
[01:39:22.170 --> 01:39:24.090]  Not just pollen chucking this time.
[01:39:24.090 --> 01:39:26.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:26.010 --> 01:39:28.970]  This male, this is his, the same male,
[01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:31.490]  probably his 10th time pollinating shit.
[01:39:31.490 --> 01:39:33.210]  A clone of the same male, not the same guy,
[01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:34.050]  but a clone of that one.
[01:39:34.050 --> 01:39:36.770]  This is 10th time hitting stuff, at least.
[01:39:36.770 --> 01:39:37.690]  Shoot.
[01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:41.630]  My one male that I already have picked out,
[01:39:41.630 --> 01:39:43.130]  proven himself and everything.
[01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:47.630]  I took clones of him the other day and I took like 25.
[01:39:47.630 --> 01:39:48.590]  Nice.
[01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:49.430]  Just to make sure.
[01:39:49.430 --> 01:39:50.250]  Oh yeah.
[01:39:50.250 --> 01:39:51.090]  I will only keep one.
[01:39:51.090 --> 01:39:52.950]  But you gotta have one.
[01:39:52.950 --> 01:39:53.870]  Yeah, so.
[01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:56.310]  Yeah, I'm excited that all the clones I recently took,
[01:39:56.310 --> 01:39:58.550]  they all cut or they all rooted.
[01:39:58.550 --> 01:40:01.350]  Most of the seeds I've sprouted are all germinating
[01:40:02.790 --> 01:40:04.470]  and I'm working on another project.
[01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:07.070]  I am, I don't know if I want to tell everybody this,
[01:40:07.410 --> 01:40:09.450]  but I am starting to F2 Black Cherry Kim.
[01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:11.210]  I'm doing the pheno hunt to find the male and the female
[01:40:11.210 --> 01:40:12.690]  to F2 that.
[01:40:12.690 --> 01:40:14.330]  I plan to start the flowering cycle
[01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:15.850]  right at the start of the year.
[01:40:15.850 --> 01:40:19.970]  So by March 1st-ish, I should have found a good male
[01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:22.130]  and a good female that will be used.
[01:40:22.130 --> 01:40:26.210]  The clones of those will be ran next to be bred to make,
[01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:27.730]  I'll use two females and one male.
[01:40:27.730 --> 01:40:29.930]  I'll use a purple female and a non-purple female
[01:40:29.930 --> 01:40:31.810]  and see what the progeny make.
[01:40:31.810 --> 01:40:33.930]  Definitely a solid purple male.
[01:40:33.930 --> 01:40:35.050]  I just want to see if I,
[01:40:35.050 --> 01:40:37.910]  because I may make it recessive
[01:40:37.910 --> 01:40:39.550]  if I force too much purple into it.
[01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:41.910]  May not come out till the F3 if I do that
[01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:42.950]  with the two purples.
[01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:45.270]  I hope you guys are paying attention to that.
[01:40:45.270 --> 01:40:47.150]  That's random shit right there.
[01:40:47.150 --> 01:40:50.790]  Also another way that I've been setting up these tents
[01:40:50.790 --> 01:40:54.350]  with just one blower, because it seems efficient
[01:40:54.350 --> 01:40:55.830]  if you're in a small space.
[01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:58.950]  I put the five by five hut with,
[01:40:58.950 --> 01:41:02.630]  I do the blower on the roof outside of the hut.
[01:41:02.630 --> 01:41:04.770]  It's actually sitting, there's that hole right on top.
[01:41:05.490 --> 01:41:06.710]  I just set the blower right on top of there.
[01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:11.550]  I run ducting into the hut and then around into the light,
[01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:14.750]  fix the light reflector and then ducting out
[01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:16.870]  of the light reflector to a carbon filter.
[01:41:16.870 --> 01:41:19.150]  And the carbon filter is hung really high in the hut,
[01:41:19.150 --> 01:41:20.590]  as high as you can get it.
[01:41:20.590 --> 01:41:23.110]  So now you're filtering the air, pulling out humidity
[01:41:23.110 --> 01:41:25.350]  and cooling your light all at one time.
[01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:27.590]  And those work great in the garage right now
[01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:28.950]  in Colorado in the winter.
[01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:31.270]  You need a heater more than you need cooling.
[01:41:31.270 --> 01:41:33.590]  You got to put a heater in there at night to keep it warm.
[01:41:33.610 --> 01:41:35.650]  But if you've got two of those huts,
[01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:37.810]  you could run them side by side and you could vent
[01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:39.530]  that heat into the other hut from your light
[01:41:39.530 --> 01:41:40.970]  if you thought about how to do it.
[01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:42.290]  And CO2.
[01:41:42.290 --> 01:41:43.130]  Yeah.
[01:41:43.130 --> 01:41:44.770]  Which is soon to be illegal.
[01:41:44.770 --> 01:41:45.690]  Yeah.
[01:41:45.690 --> 01:41:47.090]  Sleeping plants emit CO2.
[01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:50.250]  So if you move your dark, the air from your sleeping room
[01:41:50.250 --> 01:41:54.170]  into your awake room, you are moving CO2 to a usable space.
[01:41:54.170 --> 01:41:56.410]  That's a definite good hint for people.
[01:41:57.250 --> 01:42:00.530]  I wonder if mushroom bags are on that CO2 band.
[01:42:00.530 --> 01:42:02.250]  Sorry to keep harping on that.
[01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:03.790]  I know that that's a very,
[01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:05.830]  I think they're talking about using tanks
[01:42:05.830 --> 01:42:07.670]  is what they're afraid of because it's unsafe.
[01:42:07.670 --> 01:42:09.190]  Because we have to travel with tanks
[01:42:09.190 --> 01:42:11.710]  and we don't have any sort of licensing or anything.
[01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:12.550]  Oh Jesus.
[01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:15.270]  But my argument, because I am going to go to city council
[01:42:15.270 --> 01:42:17.630]  when this comes up, I'm going to say,
[01:42:17.630 --> 01:42:19.710]  this is available at the hydroponic store.
[01:42:19.710 --> 01:42:23.370]  Why can the guy growing tomatoes or the guy growing orchids
[01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:25.870]  or whatever else he's using, why can he have CO2?
[01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:28.070]  And since I'm a cannabis grower, I cannot.
[01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:31.150]  I drive around with a bottle of acetylene.
[01:42:31.170 --> 01:42:33.290]  You want to talk about something fucking dangerous.
[01:42:33.290 --> 01:42:34.330]  Yeah.
[01:42:34.330 --> 01:42:35.770]  I have no special license.
[01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:38.170]  I went down to Airgas and they gave it to me.
[01:42:38.170 --> 01:42:41.010]  I signed a contract that says I wouldn't damage their bottle
[01:42:41.010 --> 01:42:42.330]  but I'm not.
[01:42:42.330 --> 01:42:43.170]  That's all they cared about.
[01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:44.530]  Don't ruin their container.
[01:42:44.530 --> 01:42:46.850]  I could blow up a freaking building with that.
[01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:48.930]  Not that I'm going to.
[01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:51.130]  Accidentally you could on accident.
[01:42:53.370 --> 01:42:56.690]  The capability lies there.
[01:42:59.010 --> 01:43:00.250]  You'd be the last one to ever do that bro.
[01:43:00.270 --> 01:43:01.090]  Don't worry.
[01:43:01.090 --> 01:43:02.070]  I know you just said that and you got paranoid
[01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.910]  right after you said it.
[01:43:02.910 --> 01:43:04.350]  You're like, I can't say that on the air, can I?
[01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:05.390]  I can't say that shit.
[01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:06.390]  Abort.
[01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:07.630]  Yeah.
[01:43:07.630 --> 01:43:10.190]  There's so many more dangerous things out there than.
[01:43:10.190 --> 01:43:11.030]  Yeah.
[01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.950]  Anyways, yeah.
[01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:12.790]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:14.470]  Let's save this for Mike.
[01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:15.310]  Save this for Mike.
[01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:17.550]  Mike, we need you back on the show here in a week or two
[01:43:17.550 --> 01:43:18.790]  because you've been going to those meetings.
[01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:19.630]  Dude, thanks a lot.
[01:43:19.630 --> 01:43:20.450]  That is not my thing.
[01:43:20.450 --> 01:43:22.870]  I'm so glad you're gone, but we need you to come update us
[01:43:22.870 --> 01:43:24.230]  with what's going on in our community
[01:43:24.230 --> 01:43:26.350]  and what kind of rules they're trying to enforce on us.
[01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:29.590]  I wanted to go the other night, but fucking weather.
[01:43:29.890 --> 01:43:31.930]  The weather and the growers have been busy.
[01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:32.770]  That was a night that got shitty.
[01:43:32.770 --> 01:43:34.290]  It's yeah.
[01:43:34.290 --> 01:43:36.810]  It went from like, ooh, it's kind of chilly out
[01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:39.050]  to oh my God, it's snowing instantly.
[01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:41.210]  Yeah, I think I was wearing shorts that day.
[01:43:41.210 --> 01:43:43.530]  Yeah, it was like 60 degrees.
[01:43:43.530 --> 01:43:48.090]  And within an hour it was fucking damn near freezing.
[01:43:48.090 --> 01:43:50.010]  Minus six was cold the other night.
[01:43:50.010 --> 01:43:51.190]  I was driving home.
[01:43:51.190 --> 01:43:53.050]  It was nice and cold at minus six.
[01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:54.370]  It's fricking cold right now, man.
[01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:57.210]  It was coming down like crazy out there.
[01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:59.210]  I'm getting better at it.
[01:43:59.830 --> 01:44:00.730]  Once you're prepared, the first few winter,
[01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:01.630]  I'm from California, dude.
[01:44:01.630 --> 01:44:03.390]  When I first moved here, winter killed me.
[01:44:03.390 --> 01:44:05.330]  And now I don't get, I'm a knock on wood.
[01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:07.070]  I don't get sick like I used to.
[01:44:07.070 --> 01:44:09.190]  When I first moved here, I'd get terribly sick every winter
[01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:11.470]  just because I didn't know what to do with minus six.
[01:44:11.470 --> 01:44:14.110]  I have to go to school and I didn't know even how.
[01:44:14.110 --> 01:44:14.950]  What do you do?
[01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:16.470]  How do you even dress for this?
[01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:19.350]  You got to dress like it's Antarctica to get to school.
[01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:21.630]  And then when you get to school, it's 77 in the classroom.
[01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:23.030]  So now you're sweating your ass off.
[01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:24.870]  I had to learn how to adjust without getting sick.
[01:44:24.870 --> 01:44:25.710]  It's weird.
[01:44:25.710 --> 01:44:28.790]  I'm from Durango, so I've been used to it.
[01:44:29.650 --> 01:44:32.290]  Living in Pueblo softened me up.
[01:44:32.290 --> 01:44:35.250]  So this is like, whoa.
[01:44:35.250 --> 01:44:37.130]  I think these genera, we were talking about this earlier.
[01:44:37.130 --> 01:44:40.330]  These generations are getting softer as we go.
[01:44:40.330 --> 01:44:41.610]  We were talking about a doctor.
[01:44:41.610 --> 01:44:43.450]  Our good buddy Spence had his appendix removed
[01:44:43.450 --> 01:44:45.470]  and Jesse was kind enough to post a meme
[01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:47.730]  of a doctor removing his own damn appendix
[01:44:47.730 --> 01:44:49.170]  on Spencer's Facebook.
[01:44:49.170 --> 01:44:50.970]  That's pretty cute.
[01:44:50.970 --> 01:44:52.910]  But this generation, I don't know how many people
[01:44:52.910 --> 01:44:54.950]  would just reach down and remove their own appendix.
[01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:56.290]  We're too entitled.
[01:44:56.290 --> 01:44:57.930]  Shouldn't somebody else do this?
[01:44:59.290 --> 01:45:01.770]  It's kind of where we are.
[01:45:01.770 --> 01:45:04.170]  Guys, if you have more questions about a hydro hut,
[01:45:04.170 --> 01:45:05.210]  I'm pretty good at them.
[01:45:05.210 --> 01:45:07.010]  I just don't know what to say.
[01:45:07.010 --> 01:45:08.930]  If you got a question, I can set up your hydro hut
[01:45:08.930 --> 01:45:09.770]  like a champ.
[01:45:09.770 --> 01:45:11.490]  I can give you a lot of advice on that.
[01:45:12.690 --> 01:45:15.890]  Bracing, sometimes these hoods and you get a carbon filter
[01:45:15.890 --> 01:45:18.450]  and a blower and everything hung up there.
[01:45:18.450 --> 01:45:20.450]  Easy ways to brace it.
[01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:21.450]  It's a good idea.
[01:45:21.450 --> 01:45:26.450]  Go buy some PVC and just fricking tape it really tight
[01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:30.430]  or tie it to the other roof beams.
[01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:32.990]  That'll help give you a little structure up there.
[01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:35.750]  I've seen someone screw up.
[01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:36.950]  They had a four by four hood.
[01:45:36.950 --> 01:45:39.030]  So they took a four by four piece of plywood
[01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:41.870]  and screwed it to the roof on the outside.
[01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:44.150]  And that really, really strengthened that.
[01:45:44.150 --> 01:45:47.630]  Yeah, man, the dude could have stood on the top of it.
[01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:49.310]  Nice, they are a little rickety.
[01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:50.350]  They're a little wobbly.
[01:45:50.350 --> 01:45:52.550]  If you're putting like a heavy,
[01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:54.630]  if you don't have the right carbon filter,
[01:45:54.630 --> 01:45:55.910]  the good carbon filters are heavy.
[01:45:56.410 --> 01:45:57.650]  They sell lighter ones that are more expensive.
[01:45:57.650 --> 01:45:58.730]  If you don't have that one,
[01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:00.530]  put a lot of weight up there.
[01:46:00.530 --> 01:46:01.570]  A light is expensive.
[01:46:01.570 --> 01:46:04.210]  If you're hanging like a triple XL Raptor,
[01:46:04.210 --> 01:46:05.370]  that's some heavy shit.
[01:46:06.410 --> 01:46:08.930]  You probably don't need one of those in a tent.
[01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:11.410]  Just a little, you know, tent there.
[01:46:12.730 --> 01:46:16.450]  What are the eight inch sun?
[01:46:18.010 --> 01:46:20.410]  Oh, sun stars.
[01:46:20.410 --> 01:46:21.250]  No.
[01:46:21.250 --> 01:46:22.690]  Yeah, I know exactly which reflectors I love.
[01:46:22.690 --> 01:46:23.930]  And the Radian sixes.
[01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:25.690]  Oh yeah, the radian six or the radian eight.
[01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:27.270]  It's about the size of a shoe box.
[01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:28.090]  It's nice and light.
[01:46:28.090 --> 01:46:28.930]  Those are great.
[01:46:28.930 --> 01:46:30.710]  I think instead of a big wide reflector,
[01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:32.990]  a little reflector is better because,
[01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:35.470]  and you can make a sexual joke out of this if you want,
[01:46:35.470 --> 01:46:36.830]  but I want it to go deeper.
[01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:38.210]  I don't want it so wide.
[01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:42.350]  I want my light to penetrate the canopy a little more.
[01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:43.190]  I was gonna say you get better penetration.
[01:46:43.190 --> 01:46:44.910]  Yeah, I want more penetration.
[01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:46.590]  I don't need you tearing it apart so wide.
[01:46:46.590 --> 01:46:47.430]  Go deeper.
[01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:50.270]  It's still, I mean, you got a thousand watts
[01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.590]  is a thousand watts.
[01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:54.950]  So if your reflector spreading it out to a five by five area
[01:46:54.970 --> 01:46:56.570]  or you have a reflector spreading it out
[01:46:56.570 --> 01:47:00.290]  to a three by three area, which, you know,
[01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:02.250]  reflector you're gonna get a better value
[01:47:02.250 --> 01:47:03.610]  for that thousand watts from.
[01:47:03.610 --> 01:47:05.810]  And in my opinion, it's gonna be the three by three
[01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:06.650]  every time.
[01:47:06.650 --> 01:47:07.470]  Absolutely.
[01:47:07.470 --> 01:47:09.610]  And in those huts, those huts are very well made
[01:47:09.610 --> 01:47:11.650]  with that reflective material in there.
[01:47:11.650 --> 01:47:14.170]  I feel like I get a lot more lumens out of those huts
[01:47:14.170 --> 01:47:15.970]  than I do the open rooms that I run.
[01:47:16.890 --> 01:47:18.210]  For sure.
[01:47:18.210 --> 01:47:20.170]  They take better pictures too.
[01:47:20.170 --> 01:47:21.090]  Yeah, they sure do.
[01:47:21.090 --> 01:47:22.770]  They got that sexy background in there.
[01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:23.610]  All right.
[01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:24.730]  So most of this is the same.
[01:47:25.510 --> 01:47:26.350]  If you're working in a bedroom or a closet,
[01:47:26.350 --> 01:47:28.350]  just on a smaller scale,
[01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:30.670]  if you can't cut holes for ducting,
[01:47:30.670 --> 01:47:31.590]  try using a window.
[01:47:31.590 --> 01:47:34.150]  We kind of talked about tricking you on the windows.
[01:47:34.150 --> 01:47:37.470]  Once again, use some of that blue foam board.
[01:47:37.470 --> 01:47:38.630]  I don't, I think it's for insulation.
[01:47:38.630 --> 01:47:39.990]  They got it at Lowe's.
[01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:43.470]  Cut that to size, pop that in your window with some duct tape.
[01:47:43.470 --> 01:47:45.370]  If you need to cut holes out of that,
[01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:48.270]  I take, actually I use a pre-made six inch
[01:47:48.270 --> 01:47:50.790]  or eight inch flange that's used for a blower.
[01:47:50.790 --> 01:47:52.790]  And I set that on that blue foam board
[01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:53.750]  and I just step on it.
[01:47:53.770 --> 01:47:55.170]  And that's how I cut holes in my foam board.
[01:47:55.170 --> 01:47:56.610]  Perfect sizes for my ducts.
[01:47:56.610 --> 01:47:57.450]  Nice.
[01:47:57.450 --> 01:47:58.650]  Yeah, put your shoe on and step on it.
[01:47:58.650 --> 01:48:01.490]  That should cut the piss out of it.
[01:48:01.490 --> 01:48:02.490]  Yeah.
[01:48:02.490 --> 01:48:04.370]  And then you gotta knock that out
[01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:05.330]  because it gets stuck in there.
[01:48:05.330 --> 01:48:07.730]  So you gotta use something to punch it out.
[01:48:07.730 --> 01:48:08.570]  It's kind of fun.
[01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:12.210]  Damn, that's a nice little life hack
[01:48:12.210 --> 01:48:13.970]  is the popular new term on that.
[01:48:13.970 --> 01:48:15.530]  Or grow room hack.
[01:48:15.530 --> 01:48:18.730]  Instead of trying to cut, just be lazy and stomp it out.
[01:48:18.730 --> 01:48:20.050]  I always use a drywall saw
[01:48:20.050 --> 01:48:22.250]  and make a gigantic mess everywhere.
[01:48:22.250 --> 01:48:23.090]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:23.550 --> 01:48:24.790]  When you cut that blue foam board,
[01:48:24.790 --> 01:48:26.830]  it's gonna make a gigantic foamy mess everywhere
[01:48:26.830 --> 01:48:28.950]  and it'll clog up your saws like nothing other.
[01:48:28.950 --> 01:48:29.790]  Oh yeah.
[01:48:29.790 --> 01:48:31.030]  It gets real hot.
[01:48:32.630 --> 01:48:34.350]  Yeah, disguise your out ducts.
[01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:38.030]  If you can duct it out of the attic or a chimney,
[01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:39.630]  that's awesome.
[01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:40.710]  You don't want your neighbors seeing.
[01:48:40.710 --> 01:48:42.630]  It's minus six outside right now.
[01:48:42.630 --> 01:48:44.470]  Where my heat is dumping outside,
[01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:46.170]  I'm pretty sure it's making steam.
[01:48:47.030 --> 01:48:47.870]  Yeah.
[01:48:47.870 --> 01:48:48.710]  Yeah.
[01:48:48.710 --> 01:48:50.510]  No matter, even if it's 20 degrees,
[01:48:50.510 --> 01:48:53.030]  it'll probably make steam dumping into minus six.
[01:48:53.970 --> 01:48:56.010]  So they can see your air coming out of your grow space
[01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:58.850]  at 80 degrees coming from the lights.
[01:48:58.850 --> 01:49:00.290]  Yeah, I've seen that before.
[01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:03.210]  Melting snow off the roof.
[01:49:04.210 --> 01:49:05.730]  There was a guy in another neighborhood
[01:49:05.730 --> 01:49:07.410]  that a friend of mine and I used to make fun of
[01:49:07.410 --> 01:49:08.890]  because every morning at seven o'clock,
[01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:10.530]  you could see the blower click in
[01:49:10.530 --> 01:49:13.250]  and the one section would clear from the snow.
[01:49:13.250 --> 01:49:14.210]  About 30 minutes later,
[01:49:14.210 --> 01:49:15.890]  one side of the roof would be all clear.
[01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:17.350]  Like that's where his grow space is.
[01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:19.610]  You can see it in the attic right up there.
[01:49:19.610 --> 01:49:21.890]  All right, so you got all your automation.
[01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:22.930]  You've got everything ducted.
[01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:24.590]  You've got lights going.
[01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:25.410]  We've got timers.
[01:49:26.510 --> 01:49:27.770]  Man, it's almost time to add plants.
[01:49:27.770 --> 01:49:30.550]  I would say, get everything set up, run the room.
[01:49:30.550 --> 01:49:31.870]  Set all of your timers and everything.
[01:49:31.870 --> 01:49:32.830]  Run a cycle or two.
[01:49:32.830 --> 01:49:34.310]  Make sure your air conditioner kicks in
[01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:35.490]  when it gets too hot.
[01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:38.190]  Make sure the lights go off and on as planned.
[01:49:38.190 --> 01:49:39.630]  Pay attention to the temps and humidity
[01:49:39.630 --> 01:49:41.270]  without the plants in the room.
[01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:44.790]  And this is the time to make corrections if you need to.
[01:49:44.790 --> 01:49:47.710]  Also keep in mind, an empty room runs hotter
[01:49:47.710 --> 01:49:49.590]  than a room full of plants.
[01:49:49.590 --> 01:49:52.590]  When plants absorb heat and energy.
[01:49:53.250 --> 01:49:55.770]  It will also be less humid without plants.
[01:49:55.770 --> 01:49:56.970]  So it's gonna be hotter.
[01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:59.890]  So when I put plants in, the plants are gonna cool it.
[01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:04.410]  Do you have a guess if I were running this eight by eight
[01:50:04.410 --> 01:50:07.330]  room, how many degrees my plants are gonna drop it?
[01:50:07.330 --> 01:50:08.850]  Okay.
[01:50:08.850 --> 01:50:09.930]  He's completely right.
[01:50:09.930 --> 01:50:12.410]  But I thought he may have done more thought on that.
[01:50:12.410 --> 01:50:13.850]  I've noticed it, but I don't know.
[01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:15.490]  And I also know that when I'm in there,
[01:50:15.490 --> 01:50:17.130]  I heat the room up ridiculously.
[01:50:18.010 --> 01:50:19.250]  So fast.
[01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:22.290]  I've really noticed it mostly on tents.
[01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.950]  Actually, you know what?
[01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:26.090]  I've noticed it on gigantic rooms too.
[01:50:27.390 --> 01:50:29.150]  It varies.
[01:50:29.150 --> 01:50:30.830]  It's at least a couple of degrees.
[01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:32.430]  Dirt can hold a shit ton of heat.
[01:50:32.430 --> 01:50:33.630]  Dirt kind of, yeah.
[01:50:33.630 --> 01:50:34.470]  Kind of.
[01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:38.430]  And reservoirs, you know, they'll hold heat too.
[01:50:38.430 --> 01:50:39.630]  Water reservoirs.
[01:50:39.630 --> 01:50:40.470]  Yeah.
[01:50:40.470 --> 01:50:42.710]  Yeah, so that's how we heat greenhouses.
[01:50:42.710 --> 01:50:45.210]  I was gonna say, I've seen you guys put big jugs of water
[01:50:45.210 --> 01:50:47.230]  in the sun and then haul them into the greenhouse at night
[01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:48.390]  to keep them warm.
[01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:51.470]  My friend Ryan actually was heating bricks in his oven.
[01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:53.890]  He would put a big, like a pot of bricks.
[01:50:53.890 --> 01:50:55.690]  Like he was just making a pot roast full of bricks
[01:50:55.690 --> 01:50:57.170]  and he'd heat those up and then go outside
[01:50:57.170 --> 01:50:59.130]  and cover the plants in a tarp
[01:50:59.130 --> 01:51:01.730]  and then put the hot bricks underneath the tarp.
[01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:04.450]  He just harvested like a week ago in Colorado.
[01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:05.290]  Nice.
[01:51:05.290 --> 01:51:06.110]  Yeah, outdoors.
[01:51:06.110 --> 01:51:08.010]  Speaking of all these cold weathers,
[01:51:09.810 --> 01:51:12.770]  God, let's go down to Walmart's.
[01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:19.010]  My greenhouse, I harvested all the plants
[01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:21.470]  right before it got freezing cold in it.
[01:51:22.470 --> 01:51:25.350]  But I had a couple of containers with lettuce and spinach
[01:51:25.350 --> 01:51:27.030]  and radish and onions.
[01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:31.350]  And I'm super stoked that with my little tiny heater
[01:51:31.350 --> 01:51:34.470]  and my little greenhouse, the spinach made it through.
[01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:35.870]  So did some of the lettuce.
[01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:36.750]  Nice.
[01:51:36.750 --> 01:51:38.230]  Everything else is frozen.
[01:51:38.230 --> 01:51:39.070]  Frozen.
[01:51:39.070 --> 01:51:39.910]  It fucking did, but.
[01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:41.230]  Frozen vegetables already.
[01:51:41.230 --> 01:51:42.070]  Yeah.
[01:51:43.230 --> 01:51:46.030]  All right, guys, we're getting 50 minutes in here.
[01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.870]  Yeah, run your rooms.
[01:51:46.870 --> 01:51:47.710]  That's what I'm gonna say.
[01:51:47.710 --> 01:51:48.550]  Run the rooms.
[01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:50.850]  Run it and then once everything is cool,
[01:51:50.850 --> 01:51:52.050]  then you can put plants in there
[01:51:52.050 --> 01:51:53.690]  and then you're gonna have to make a couple of adjustments
[01:51:53.690 --> 01:51:55.810]  once you put plants in there.
[01:51:55.810 --> 01:51:56.850]  For sure.
[01:51:56.850 --> 01:51:58.330]  If you're just vegging, you're fine.
[01:51:58.330 --> 01:52:00.490]  You can tweak around with your rooms while you're vegging.
[01:52:00.490 --> 01:52:02.090]  You're not gonna piss the plants off too much.
[01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:03.530]  As soon as you start flower,
[01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:05.370]  you have to be really, really careful
[01:52:05.370 --> 01:52:06.450]  with your photo periods.
[01:52:06.450 --> 01:52:07.410]  That's your light cycle.
[01:52:07.410 --> 01:52:08.810]  We call that photo period.
[01:52:08.810 --> 01:52:10.530]  We're gonna start saying photo period all the time
[01:52:10.530 --> 01:52:11.770]  and leave out the word light cycles
[01:52:11.770 --> 01:52:14.090]  because photo period is appropriate and proper.
[01:52:14.970 --> 01:52:18.090]  If you interrupt your photo period on a flowering plant,
[01:52:18.110 --> 01:52:20.710]  it will possibly revert back to veg
[01:52:20.710 --> 01:52:22.310]  and it will probably hermaphrodite
[01:52:22.310 --> 01:52:23.790]  and you're running a good chance
[01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:25.750]  of making some seeds out of that on accident
[01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:26.590]  that you don't want.
[01:52:26.590 --> 01:52:28.770]  So don't mess with your photo period.
[01:52:28.770 --> 01:52:29.990]  Keep that solid.
[01:52:29.990 --> 01:52:31.550]  Yeah, leave the seeds to us.
[01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:33.350]  No, no, no.
[01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:34.190]  Just kidding.
[01:52:34.190 --> 01:52:35.030]  Please do.
[01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:37.830]  If you've got a good breeding project, keep it going.
[01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:38.670]  Okay, props to you.
[01:52:38.670 --> 01:52:41.390]  I used to be really kind of secretive
[01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:43.950]  and I didn't like to share my breeding information
[01:52:43.950 --> 01:52:45.190]  because I feel like I'll teach you how to grow,
[01:52:45.190 --> 01:52:47.350]  but breeding, you gotta get a good grasp on breed,
[01:52:47.410 --> 01:52:48.770]  on growing, and once you've got that,
[01:52:48.770 --> 01:52:50.470]  then you'll kind of learn how to breed
[01:52:50.470 --> 01:52:52.050]  with that on accident.
[01:52:52.050 --> 01:52:52.890]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:52:54.050 --> 01:52:55.450]  But I've kind of been sharing a little bit
[01:52:55.450 --> 01:52:56.330]  of my breeding secrets.
[01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:58.090]  So if you guys have a specific question,
[01:52:58.090 --> 01:53:00.010]  I'd rather help you than just watch you fail
[01:53:00.010 --> 01:53:00.890]  is how I feel about it.
[01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:03.470]  You're gonna do it, so why not help you do it right?
[01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:06.330]  When I first got started, I won't mention any names,
[01:53:06.330 --> 01:53:08.550]  but I hit up a couple of guys,
[01:53:09.610 --> 01:53:11.810]  you know, just with some basic questions
[01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:15.090]  and I got told to, you know, fuck off basically.
[01:53:15.110 --> 01:53:18.870]  So always kind of disheartened me,
[01:53:18.870 --> 01:53:20.110]  but it also encouraged me.
[01:53:20.110 --> 01:53:22.070]  I was like, screw these guys, I can do this.
[01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:24.810]  Right, just taking a little time to research stuff
[01:53:24.810 --> 01:53:26.790]  and read it on your own goes a long way.
[01:53:26.790 --> 01:53:28.390]  The internet is great, but,
[01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:31.070]  and I've been banned from so many forums and chat rooms
[01:53:31.070 --> 01:53:32.830]  because the internet is full of shit
[01:53:32.830 --> 01:53:34.590]  and people will type whatever they want
[01:53:34.590 --> 01:53:36.630]  without knowing what they're talking about.
[01:53:36.630 --> 01:53:39.390]  And I feel that that sucks because it causes problems.
[01:53:39.390 --> 01:53:40.830]  That's part of what inspired this show
[01:53:40.830 --> 01:53:42.190]  was reading shit on the internet going,
[01:53:42.190 --> 01:53:43.870]  dude, I hope nobody tried that.
[01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:46.170]  Or actually seeing somebody ask his friend a question
[01:53:46.170 --> 01:53:47.970]  on a forum that sounds like Troll It Up,
[01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:49.610]  but it's not Troll It Up, it's very similar.
[01:53:49.610 --> 01:53:51.690]  I've been banned, so I won't advertise the site,
[01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:53.930]  but on Troll It Up, somebody asked a question
[01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:56.530]  and the guy replied with a totally bullshit answer
[01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:58.530]  to his friend and he's like, awesome, man,
[01:53:58.530 --> 01:53:59.690]  I'm gonna try it today.
[01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:00.570]  And I'm like, dude, don't,
[01:54:00.570 --> 01:54:02.450]  your friend just killed your whole crop.
[01:54:02.450 --> 01:54:04.890]  However many plants you have, they're dead if you do that.
[01:54:04.890 --> 01:54:06.170]  And that's part of what inspired this.
[01:54:06.170 --> 01:54:07.770]  I wanted to get people that know what they're doing
[01:54:07.770 --> 01:54:10.650]  to come and put a good voice out for cannabis.
[01:54:10.670 --> 01:54:15.670]  There's a thing on the Probiotics Farmers Alliance,
[01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:18.630]  a pin, it's the very first post if you ever join it.
[01:54:19.630 --> 01:54:22.790]  I can't quote it for verbatim, but by any means,
[01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:26.750]  but it just says essentially,
[01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:31.590]  don't make something fact just because you believe,
[01:54:31.590 --> 01:54:36.270]  I can't really recreate it, but yeah, it's just,
[01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:39.110]  there's so much shit out there
[01:54:39.130 --> 01:54:40.970]  and people just type shit and they believe it
[01:54:40.970 --> 01:54:42.610]  and they're full of shit themselves.
[01:54:42.610 --> 01:54:45.250]  And what works for them may not work for you.
[01:54:45.250 --> 01:54:47.410]  Your situation could be totally different.
[01:54:47.410 --> 01:54:48.850]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:54:48.850 --> 01:54:50.490]  I don't think I'm a member of that group anymore,
[01:54:50.490 --> 01:54:51.890]  so I won't be able to see it.
[01:54:52.810 --> 01:54:53.650]  I had to leave that group
[01:54:53.650 --> 01:54:54.530]  because they put up too much stuff
[01:54:54.530 --> 01:54:55.570]  and I got way too many.
[01:54:55.570 --> 01:54:58.890]  Yeah, I mean, it's a great place, but yeah.
[01:54:58.890 --> 01:55:01.290]  Yeah, I'm not in the group, so I can't view their stuff,
[01:55:01.290 --> 01:55:03.210]  but still, good group.
[01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:05.690]  Yeah, yeah, Allen Atkinson.
[01:55:05.830 --> 01:55:09.470]  It's a lot of the Gage Green genetics group too.
[01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:11.310]  Yeah, those guys are, man,
[01:55:11.310 --> 01:55:13.030]  they're sharing incredible knowledge.
[01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.870]  That's just-
[01:55:13.870 --> 01:55:14.830]  Incredible genetics.
[01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:16.510]  The stuff Gage Green has been putting out lately
[01:55:16.510 --> 01:55:17.430]  is super impressive.
[01:55:17.430 --> 01:55:20.350]  I actually breed with a Gage Green genetics Daybreaker male,
[01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:21.950]  so that's how much I like that shit.
[01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:24.190]  I've made my own F2 Daybreaker male to use
[01:55:24.190 --> 01:55:26.830]  so that I don't have to use Gage's original workings.
[01:55:26.830 --> 01:55:28.150]  I have two days to have my own.
[01:55:28.150 --> 01:55:30.030]  Yeah, it's a good strain.
[01:55:30.030 --> 01:55:30.910]  Adam was here the other night
[01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:33.550]  and I cut down nine Daybreaker plants
[01:55:33.550 --> 01:55:35.630]  that were about three feet tall.
[01:55:36.450 --> 01:55:37.450]  Eugenics, basically.
[01:55:37.450 --> 01:55:39.210]  They weren't for what I needed for that project
[01:55:39.210 --> 01:55:41.530]  and he didn't know what to think, dude.
[01:55:41.530 --> 01:55:43.810]  He's not an avid pot gardener.
[01:55:43.810 --> 01:55:45.570]  I was like, hold this trash bag open for me.
[01:55:45.570 --> 01:55:46.650]  And he's like, what are you gonna do?
[01:55:46.650 --> 01:55:48.090]  And I'm like, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[01:55:48.090 --> 01:55:50.250]  And he just went, oh, he told me I made him sick.
[01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:51.950]  He's like, my heart's broken, man.
[01:55:56.770 --> 01:55:58.890]  Last spring, I had a plant that got some mold
[01:55:58.890 --> 01:56:01.970]  and I didn't notice it until we were trimming it
[01:56:01.970 --> 01:56:05.210]  and I saw it, threw the freaking thing away.
[01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:07.950]  And the guy that was helping me trim,
[01:56:07.950 --> 01:56:11.310]  I'm pretty sure he wanted to go take it to the trash can.
[01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:12.150]  I just threw it in the dirt.
[01:56:12.150 --> 01:56:13.750]  I was like, dude, I'm not, no.
[01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:17.550]  I had a, like your situation,
[01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:20.110]  I had a white rhino plant that had to be five ounces.
[01:56:20.110 --> 01:56:21.590]  It's a seven gallon pot.
[01:56:21.590 --> 01:56:23.270]  The top cola was as big as a football.
[01:56:23.270 --> 01:56:25.310]  It was the size of this Gatorade bottle.
[01:56:25.310 --> 01:56:27.350]  And it was this season of the year,
[01:56:27.350 --> 01:56:28.910]  so there was a lot of cold in the air.
[01:56:28.910 --> 01:56:31.190]  And I was like, that plant, I know it already.
[01:56:31.190 --> 01:56:32.350]  And I kept checking it, nothing.
[01:56:32.350 --> 01:56:33.270]  Kept checking it, nothing.
[01:56:33.270 --> 01:56:34.830]  At harvest time, the center of one bud
[01:56:35.450 --> 01:56:36.290]  had mildew all up the middle.
[01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:37.730]  And I threw the whole plant away
[01:56:37.730 --> 01:56:39.670]  because I didn't want to go fish through every bud.
[01:56:39.670 --> 01:56:42.130]  And my trimmer buddy, Mike, it was Mike at the time.
[01:56:42.130 --> 01:56:43.970]  We were just kind of new friends at the time.
[01:56:43.970 --> 01:56:45.810]  I just put a trash bag over it and threw it all away.
[01:56:45.810 --> 01:56:47.330]  And he's like, the whole thing, bro?
[01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:50.050]  And I was like, yeah, we can't mess with that.
[01:56:50.050 --> 01:56:52.930]  That's the difference between a pot farmer and a caregiver.
[01:56:52.930 --> 01:56:54.130]  I'm growing medical weed.
[01:56:54.130 --> 01:56:55.210]  The person that would have sold that
[01:56:55.210 --> 01:56:57.450]  is just growing shitty weed for money.
[01:56:57.450 --> 01:56:58.850]  Oh, and then also, I mean, yeah,
[01:56:58.850 --> 01:57:02.130]  there's just so many reasons to throw it away.
[01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:04.050]  I don't like failure, so.
[01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:05.990]  I don't want to keep a moldy plant around my house
[01:57:05.990 --> 01:57:07.590]  to spread mold spores even more.
[01:57:07.590 --> 01:57:10.310]  And just, you know, screw it.
[01:57:10.310 --> 01:57:11.670]  Yeah, take some pride in what you do, guys.
[01:57:11.670 --> 01:57:13.470]  You're working really hard at growing cannabis.
[01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:14.310]  Do it right.
[01:57:14.310 --> 01:57:15.310]  Don't make people sicker.
[01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:17.190]  Make people feel better.
[01:57:17.190 --> 01:57:18.230]  All right, I feel like we went over
[01:57:18.230 --> 01:57:21.030]  a whole bunch of information in kind of a scattered way.
[01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:23.630]  Keep your plants off the ground.
[01:57:23.630 --> 01:57:25.590]  Yeah, keep your plants off the ground,
[01:57:25.590 --> 01:57:27.350]  especially in this cold weather.
[01:57:27.350 --> 01:57:30.830]  Keep everything off the concrete floor you can.
[01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:33.470]  That's your nutrients, your water reservoir,
[01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:34.850]  your clone trays most definitely.
[01:57:34.850 --> 01:57:36.170]  Oh yeah.
[01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:37.570]  Unless you're running an easy cloner
[01:57:37.570 --> 01:57:39.050]  and you need that cool water.
[01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.970]  True, true.
[01:57:39.970 --> 01:57:43.690]  That's, you know, but if you figure that out,
[01:57:43.690 --> 01:57:46.210]  you know, you're probably one of those guys
[01:57:46.210 --> 01:57:48.990]  who's just getting entertainment here, so.
[01:57:50.210 --> 01:57:51.050]  Yeah.
[01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:52.130]  Which is cool, thank you.
[01:57:52.130 --> 01:57:53.210]  Yeah, thanks for listening, guys.
[01:57:53.210 --> 01:57:55.770]  We're gonna definitely get more advanced as we go.
[01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:57.250]  We're 40 episodes in.
[01:57:57.250 --> 01:57:58.930]  You guys are learning stuff now.
[01:57:58.930 --> 01:58:00.650]  I'm learning stuff now because I have to read
[01:58:00.650 --> 01:58:01.770]  just to make sure I don't lie to you
[01:58:01.770 --> 01:58:03.290]  because I made a mistake on the show one time
[01:58:04.110 --> 01:58:04.950]  and I felt really stupid.
[01:58:04.950 --> 01:58:06.550]  I don't want to go teaching wrong shit.
[01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:08.190]  I definitely had to come back and correct myself.
[01:58:08.190 --> 01:58:09.790]  So I've been making sure to read everything
[01:58:09.790 --> 01:58:10.630]  and stay on top.
[01:58:10.630 --> 01:58:11.630]  I'm reading more about nutrients
[01:58:11.630 --> 01:58:13.390]  because I know about nutrients,
[01:58:13.390 --> 01:58:14.670]  but you get so comfortable
[01:58:14.670 --> 01:58:16.190]  that you don't even pay attention anymore.
[01:58:16.190 --> 01:58:17.910]  I'm like, I know when I look at that plant,
[01:58:17.910 --> 01:58:19.230]  that's a phosphorus deficiency.
[01:58:19.230 --> 01:58:22.030]  I need to give it some phosphorus and I just get in there.
[01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:24.750]  I'm gonna have to kind of brush up a little bit more.
[01:58:24.750 --> 01:58:27.150]  Yeah, I need to do a little homework.
[01:58:27.150 --> 01:58:29.150]  I should be doing that anyway, honestly,
[01:58:29.150 --> 01:58:31.830]  with my profession, but yeah.
[01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:34.130]  Those times when you're sitting there in the store
[01:58:34.130 --> 01:58:36.690]  ready to pull your beard out, just grab a book.
[01:58:36.690 --> 01:58:37.810]  Yeah.
[01:58:37.810 --> 01:58:39.130]  You've got the internet there.
[01:58:39.130 --> 01:58:40.570]  Yeah, no, I've got a,
[01:58:40.570 --> 01:58:42.690]  I actually got a couple of books on there.
[01:58:42.690 --> 01:58:47.690]  HydroFarm sent us a free book for employees and stuff.
[01:58:48.330 --> 01:58:49.170]  It's kind of cool.
[01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:52.890]  One of our other employees is reading it right now,
[01:58:52.890 --> 01:58:55.050]  but I can't wait to go over it.
[01:58:55.050 --> 01:58:57.810]  It's just about indoor hydroponics gardening.
[01:58:57.810 --> 01:59:00.570]  It's not pot specific or anything.
[01:59:00.630 --> 01:59:02.630]  Grow rooms are grow rooms.
[01:59:02.630 --> 01:59:05.190]  Yeah, and HydroFarm's afraid of the cannabis industry.
[01:59:06.070 --> 01:59:07.630]  Yeah.
[01:59:07.630 --> 01:59:09.390]  I like how you have to hold back on that answer.
[01:59:09.390 --> 01:59:10.910]  Oh yeah, I have.
[01:59:10.910 --> 01:59:13.510]  If you ever really want to know my view on that,
[01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:14.750]  come see me at the store.
[01:59:15.790 --> 01:59:17.750]  I've talked to several other HydroShop owners
[01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:19.310]  and you guys all seem to agree.
[01:59:19.310 --> 01:59:22.190]  Everybody feels the same about Sunlight and HydroFarm.
[01:59:22.190 --> 01:59:24.670]  Our customers built, I'll say this,
[01:59:24.670 --> 01:59:27.470]  our customers built them a hell of a nice fucking living.
[01:59:28.590 --> 01:59:30.310]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:59:30.690 --> 01:59:32.170]  Guys, I feel like it's about time to wrap up the show.
[01:59:32.170 --> 01:59:34.370]  We've been going for almost an hour here.
[01:59:34.370 --> 01:59:35.570]  Jesse, you got anybody to shout out,
[01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:38.490]  anybody to say thanks to, anything like that?
[01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:39.530]  Earned.
[01:59:39.530 --> 01:59:40.370]  Of course.
[01:59:40.370 --> 01:59:41.730]  And everyone down at the store.
[01:59:42.890 --> 01:59:44.250]  Had a good experience in there today.
[01:59:44.250 --> 01:59:45.090]  Sweet, good.
[01:59:47.610 --> 01:59:48.850]  Let me think of a strange.
[01:59:50.290 --> 01:59:54.810]  I've been digging on some SFVOG lately, big time.
[01:59:54.810 --> 01:59:57.050]  So when do I get my cut of that SFVOG?
[01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:58.170]  Oh, I thought you already had one.
[01:59:58.170 --> 01:59:59.970]  No, no, that's all I had to say, huh?
[02:00:00.630 --> 02:00:02.390]  That's the cut I've been told.
[02:00:02.390 --> 02:00:03.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:04.790]  I think I know where yours came from
[02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:06.510]  and they don't want me to have it.
[02:00:06.510 --> 02:00:08.630]  They wouldn't give it to me.
[02:00:08.630 --> 02:00:09.470]  Being a breeder, dude,
[02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:11.510]  people don't want you to have their cuts.
[02:00:12.550 --> 02:00:13.750]  Yeah, I know.
[02:00:13.750 --> 02:00:16.990]  That cut of SFV's made a lot of great strains
[02:00:16.990 --> 02:00:19.150]  and I think we're gonna make a couple with it too.
[02:00:19.150 --> 02:00:20.390]  I guarantee you we'll make a couple.
[02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:21.470]  I'll make a couple.
[02:00:21.470 --> 02:00:22.310]  You'll make a couple.
[02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:23.350]  Yeah.
[02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:24.870]  All right, guys, we're gonna wrap up the show.
[02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:27.670]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes or Stitcher.

[02:02:03.210 --> 02:02:04.450]  Yo, what's up ladies and gentlemen?
[02:02:04.450 --> 02:02:06.050]  It's time for episode number 41
[02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:07.290]  of the iGrow Culture podcast.
[02:02:07.290 --> 02:02:08.130]  I'm your host, Ross DeGeff.
[02:02:08.130 --> 02:02:10.250]  Thanks for joining me for another episode.
[02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:11.090]  Excited to be here.
[02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:13.690]  Joining me on mic tonight, our good buddy Mike is back.
[02:02:13.690 --> 02:02:14.650]  What's up everybody?
[02:02:14.650 --> 02:02:16.010]  And our good buddy Adam is here.
[02:02:16.010 --> 02:02:17.810]  Yo, Adam hasn't been here for a while.
[02:02:17.810 --> 02:02:18.690]  How you doing bro?
[02:02:18.690 --> 02:02:20.290]  I'm tired.
[02:02:21.150 --> 02:02:21.990]  Sick and tired.
[02:02:21.990 --> 02:02:23.470]  Yeah, work.
[02:02:23.470 --> 02:02:25.590]  Work, well it's about time you're doing some work.
[02:02:25.590 --> 02:02:26.710]  You had a little mini vacation.
[02:02:26.710 --> 02:02:28.630]  Yeah, it was longer than a mini vacation.
[02:02:28.630 --> 02:02:31.150]  Yeah, well, welcome back to the working community.
[02:02:31.150 --> 02:02:32.270]  Let's turn that music down a little bit
[02:02:32.270 --> 02:02:34.070]  and get a podcast going.
[02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:36.370]  We're gonna talk about some cool stuff.
[02:02:36.370 --> 02:02:37.430]  Somebody was supposed to come.
[02:02:37.430 --> 02:02:38.750]  I'm not blaming anything on Jesse.
[02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:39.670]  Jesse was trying to make it.
[02:02:39.670 --> 02:02:41.170]  He can't make it tonight, unfortunately.
[02:02:41.170 --> 02:02:43.550]  So had to kind of replan the show.
[02:02:43.550 --> 02:02:44.910]  Can we blame it on Jesse?
[02:02:44.910 --> 02:02:45.750]  It's Jesse's fault.
[02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:48.550]  Jesse couldn't make it, so we're not gonna.
[02:02:48.550 --> 02:02:50.850]  Actually, Jesse has been trying to get an electrician
[02:02:50.850 --> 02:02:52.550]  to his new Grow facility,
[02:02:52.550 --> 02:02:53.770]  and that dude's been putting him off.
[02:02:53.770 --> 02:02:55.650]  And tonight he showed up and he called me
[02:02:55.650 --> 02:02:56.890]  and I was like, dude, do that.
[02:02:56.890 --> 02:02:58.770]  Because I know how hard it is to get an electrician
[02:02:58.770 --> 02:02:59.610]  to your facility.
[02:02:59.610 --> 02:03:01.110]  And once he's there, you're paying him
[02:03:01.110 --> 02:03:02.170]  and it's hard to get him there.
[02:03:02.170 --> 02:03:03.570]  So just keep him there and get the work done.
[02:03:03.570 --> 02:03:05.310]  So Jesse had to take a rain check.
[02:03:05.310 --> 02:03:07.170]  If he can come over later or tomorrow,
[02:03:07.170 --> 02:03:08.730]  I'll put out another show in the middle of the week
[02:03:08.730 --> 02:03:09.570]  with Jesse.
[02:03:09.570 --> 02:03:10.390]  Do it.
[02:03:10.390 --> 02:03:11.230]  Nice.
[02:03:11.230 --> 02:03:13.170]  Yeah, Jesse was kind enough to host another party
[02:03:13.170 --> 02:03:14.070]  at Hygro last night.
[02:03:14.070 --> 02:03:15.770]  We'll talk about that a little bit.
[02:03:15.770 --> 02:03:17.370]  I need to, before I even forget,
[02:03:17.370 --> 02:03:18.390]  before I have a chance to forget,
[02:03:19.230 --> 02:03:21.290]  I need to give a huge shout out to NanoLux Lighting
[02:03:21.290 --> 02:03:23.270]  and Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:03:24.990 --> 02:03:26.850]  Everyone just looked over across the room here.
[02:03:26.850 --> 02:03:28.210]  There's a brand new-
[02:03:28.210 --> 02:03:29.730]  Pretty new toy.
[02:03:29.730 --> 02:03:32.890]  Dual-ended bulb and a ballast and reflector
[02:03:32.890 --> 02:03:34.270]  all attached into one piece.
[02:03:34.270 --> 02:03:36.770]  It's the new NanoLux 1000 watt
[02:03:36.770 --> 02:03:40.550]  that actually has a 1200 watt setting on it.
[02:03:40.550 --> 02:03:43.010]  So I'm gonna be cranking 1200 watts in one section
[02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:44.690]  and we're gonna see what that light does.
[02:03:44.690 --> 02:03:46.090]  They gave it to me to run it.
[02:03:46.090 --> 02:03:47.370]  They said, run a couple cycles.
[02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:48.710]  Let us know what you think
[02:03:48.710 --> 02:03:49.930]  and we'll talk about the future.
[02:03:49.930 --> 02:03:51.510]  So if that works out,
[02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:55.790]  NanoLux may be a podcast sponsor in the future here.
[02:03:55.790 --> 02:03:57.590]  Really, really cool new toy.
[02:03:57.590 --> 02:03:58.950]  I can't wait to see what she does.
[02:03:58.950 --> 02:03:59.790]  Yeah, me too.
[02:03:59.790 --> 02:04:01.030]  It's a fancy looking light.
[02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:01.870]  For sure.
[02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:02.690]  It is.
[02:04:02.690 --> 02:04:04.110]  It's one of the dual-ended bulbs
[02:04:04.110 --> 02:04:06.190]  and it's the kind that's got the ballast
[02:04:06.190 --> 02:04:08.550]  and it's got a short reflector and I kind of like it.
[02:04:08.550 --> 02:04:09.790]  It's got it all in one piece
[02:04:09.790 --> 02:04:11.590]  and it all hangs from the ceiling.
[02:04:11.590 --> 02:04:14.030]  It's only the, is it 240 or 220?
[02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:16.290]  It's only the 240 plug.
[02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:17.350]  I always get that one confused.
[02:04:17.350 --> 02:04:18.630]  Sorry, I'm not good with remembering
[02:04:18.630 --> 02:04:19.630]  that many goddamn numbers.
[02:04:19.630 --> 02:04:20.670]  They mess with my brain.
[02:04:20.670 --> 02:04:22.430]  But I have a good feeling about that.
[02:04:22.430 --> 02:04:23.790]  I've heard a lot of good stuff.
[02:04:23.790 --> 02:04:25.530]  They gave it to me because they know I'm gonna kick ass
[02:04:25.530 --> 02:04:27.350]  with it and see what it does.
[02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:29.150]  Yeah, I probably should have asked before I touched
[02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:31.070]  but that's one of the first things I did when I walked in.
[02:04:31.070 --> 02:04:32.670]  Yeah, Adam walked in and just opened the box.
[02:04:32.670 --> 02:04:33.510]  Yeah, I looked at it.
[02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:34.350]  I watched it.
[02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:35.190]  I didn't give too much of a shit.
[02:04:35.190 --> 02:04:36.030]  I was prepared for a show.
[02:04:36.030 --> 02:04:36.850]  I was just looking.
[02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:37.690]  I just wanted to see if it was still in the box.
[02:04:37.690 --> 02:04:38.910]  You're not gonna break anything.
[02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:39.750]  That's all.
[02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:40.570]  If you do, you get to buy me a new light.
[02:04:40.570 --> 02:04:41.410]  That's cool.
[02:04:41.410 --> 02:04:42.250]  Yep.
[02:04:42.250 --> 02:04:43.090]  So what do we wanna talk about?
[02:04:43.090 --> 02:04:44.990]  We all sat around today like a bunch of bros
[02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:46.990]  and took dabs and watched a movie.
[02:04:46.990 --> 02:04:49.010]  We're gonna talk a little bit about that.
[02:04:49.010 --> 02:04:52.670]  We're actually going to watch a video on the show together
[02:04:52.670 --> 02:04:54.830]  because some of us have seen it, some haven't.
[02:04:54.830 --> 02:04:56.050]  And I wanna watch it and actually,
[02:04:56.050 --> 02:04:57.390]  I haven't seen it to tell you the truth.
[02:04:57.390 --> 02:04:58.390]  And I know I need to watch it.
[02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:59.870]  I wanna watch it live on the podcast
[02:04:59.870 --> 02:05:02.390]  so that I can give you my reaction live on the air.
[02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:03.870]  It'll be fun.
[02:05:03.870 --> 02:05:04.830]  But before we get that far,
[02:05:04.830 --> 02:05:06.750]  we have to do this stuff right here.
[02:05:06.750 --> 02:05:08.650]  This podcast is brought to you by our good friends
[02:05:08.650 --> 02:05:10.910]  at Highly Educated Titanium.
[02:05:10.930 --> 02:05:13.030]  If you're using high quality concentrates,
[02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:16.530]  you deserve a high quality titanium nail made in America.
[02:05:16.530 --> 02:05:17.730]  Don't trust a Chinese nail
[02:05:17.730 --> 02:05:19.890]  or an American knockoff made of cheap metals.
[02:05:19.890 --> 02:05:21.450]  Trust the industry leader.
[02:05:21.450 --> 02:05:22.690]  Trust the innovator.
[02:05:22.690 --> 02:05:23.830]  Trust the king.
[02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:25.530]  Trust Highly Educated Titanium.
[02:05:25.530 --> 02:05:27.250]  Big, huge shout out to Task Rock.
[02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:29.850]  Dude, Task is making these new dabbers.
[02:05:29.850 --> 02:05:31.370]  He's learned this new coloring method
[02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:32.690]  so that he can color his titanium.
[02:05:32.690 --> 02:05:34.170]  Some of them look really sick.
[02:05:34.170 --> 02:05:35.370]  Shout out to Task.
[02:05:35.370 --> 02:05:38.090]  From time to time, when I'm scrolling through YouTube,
[02:05:38.090 --> 02:05:39.450]  or not YouTube, Facebook.
[02:05:39.450 --> 02:05:40.410]  Instagram.
[02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:41.750]  All of the above.
[02:05:41.750 --> 02:05:43.590]  I'm gonna push that mic a little closer to your face.
[02:05:43.590 --> 02:05:45.230]  You just got that, that's so much better.
[02:05:45.230 --> 02:05:47.410]  You just got that tone that it gets lost in the mics.
[02:05:47.410 --> 02:05:48.550]  That tone is hard to record.
[02:05:48.550 --> 02:05:49.950]  It takes me a minute to get comfortable
[02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:50.830]  at the beginning of every show.
[02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:51.710]  Sorry, listeners.
[02:05:51.710 --> 02:05:52.550]  We'll get you here.
[02:05:52.550 --> 02:05:55.190]  Dude, I was gonna talk about this in a minute.
[02:05:55.190 --> 02:05:56.190]  So I'm gonna finish this ad.
[02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:58.890]  Check out highlyeducatedti.com for more information.
[02:05:58.890 --> 02:06:00.710]  If you wanna buy some highly educated products,
[02:06:00.710 --> 02:06:02.750]  go to aqualabtechnologies.com

[02:06:04.270 --> 02:06:06.150]  Got a bunch of great stuff there.
[02:06:06.150 --> 02:06:07.530]  Huge shout out while I'm thinking about it.
[02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:08.670]  Jesse last night, dude,
[02:06:08.690 --> 02:06:11.290]  at the Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies Grower Meeting,
[02:06:11.290 --> 02:06:15.530]  gave a class lecture on taking clones.
[02:06:15.530 --> 02:06:17.250]  Nice little clone lesson, yeah.
[02:06:17.250 --> 02:06:18.650]  That dude killed it, bro.
[02:06:18.650 --> 02:06:20.890]  He actually did a hell of a good job.
[02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:22.010]  We're gonna cut this music out.
[02:06:22.010 --> 02:06:23.330]  I don't know what's next on the playlist.
[02:06:23.330 --> 02:06:24.250]  I need to give a big shout out
[02:06:24.250 --> 02:06:25.850]  to the Mystic Roots Band and Coot Dog
[02:06:25.850 --> 02:06:28.290]  and Stay Positive Sound, Stay Positive Productions.
[02:06:28.290 --> 02:06:29.770]  They have given me full permission
[02:06:29.770 --> 02:06:33.170]  to play all of the Mystic Roots library on my podcast.
[02:06:33.170 --> 02:06:34.370]  That's freaking awesome.
[02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:35.210]  Awesome, man.
[02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:36.030]  Super awesome.
[02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:38.070]  The track you just heard was DJ and a Dance,
[02:06:38.410 --> 02:06:39.450]  the instrumental version.
[02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:40.810]  They were kind enough to send me
[02:06:40.810 --> 02:06:43.130]  every track they've done instrumental.
[02:06:43.130 --> 02:06:45.250]  So now we've got a lot of fresh music for the show.
[02:06:45.250 --> 02:06:46.810]  Nice.
[02:06:46.810 --> 02:06:48.250]  So shout out to Jesse, dude.
[02:06:48.250 --> 02:06:51.210]  He did a hell of a good job hosting that party last night.
[02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:52.450]  We're gonna talk more about that in a minute,
[02:06:52.450 --> 02:06:54.690]  but I wanted to get that shout out before I forget,
[02:06:54.690 --> 02:06:57.730]  because for some reason I get forgetful.
[02:06:57.730 --> 02:06:58.570]  That'll happen.
[02:06:58.570 --> 02:06:59.890]  Yeah, we're gonna take a dab here in a minute.
[02:06:59.890 --> 02:07:01.450]  Everyone was talking about a pre-show dab
[02:07:01.450 --> 02:07:02.650]  and I wanted to get the ads out of the way
[02:07:02.650 --> 02:07:05.410]  and get those done right before I got super dabbed out
[02:07:05.410 --> 02:07:07.250]  and start coughing again.
[02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:08.750]  This podcast is always brought to you

[02:07:48.910 --> 02:07:52.090]  I'm gonna save this ad until we talk about some stuff we did.
[02:07:52.090 --> 02:07:54.370]  That's a good ad to throw in later.
[02:07:54.370 --> 02:07:57.870]  Be warned, there's a commercial coming up later, guys.
[02:07:57.870 --> 02:08:00.490]  I've been watching my buddy Ryan's Instagram and Facebook,
[02:08:00.490 --> 02:08:02.250]  and that dude's having a good-ass time.
[02:08:02.250 --> 02:08:03.130]  I'm proud of you, Ryan.
[02:08:03.130 --> 02:08:06.250]  Ryan is actually the guy from treethugger.com.
[02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:09.150]  Treethugger.com is a big sponsor of our show.
[02:08:09.150 --> 02:08:09.990]  They help us out a lot.
[02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:12.730]  You guys don't even know what Ryan does for us.
[02:08:12.730 --> 02:08:15.670]  So this podcast is brought to you by treethugger.com,
[02:08:15.670 --> 02:08:17.070]  live music lifestyle magazine.
[02:08:17.070 --> 02:08:19.910]  Check out treethugger.com for concert and festival,
[02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:20.750]  news and reviews.
[02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:25.150]  I like to say, look out at the cookout with treethugger.com.
[02:08:25.150 --> 02:08:26.270]  Ryan, dude, I'm proud of you.
[02:08:26.270 --> 02:08:27.170]  You're doing well.
[02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:29.710]  I think that's enough commercials, right?
[02:08:29.710 --> 02:08:30.710]  We paid all the dues.
[02:08:30.710 --> 02:08:31.990]  I got this one sitting aside here.
[02:08:31.990 --> 02:08:33.870]  We'll cover that one.
[02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:35.670]  Big shout out to the sponsors.
[02:08:36.010 --> 02:08:37.450]  I know it sounds weird having sponsors on a podcast,
[02:08:37.450 --> 02:08:39.010]  but they help out a lot.
[02:08:39.010 --> 02:08:40.290]  It takes a lot of time.
[02:08:40.290 --> 02:08:42.690]  I get products, helps out, adds content.
[02:08:42.690 --> 02:08:44.330]  I really appreciate the sponsors.
[02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:45.990]  Tazka, you got my email today.
[02:08:45.990 --> 02:08:47.150]  Read that, bro, thanks.
[02:08:48.530 --> 02:08:50.530]  Let's see, we don't have any comments to read.
[02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:51.770]  So guess what that means, guys?
[02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:53.270]  It's time to take a quick dab,
[02:08:53.270 --> 02:08:54.450]  and then we're gonna come back
[02:08:54.450 --> 02:08:57.690]  and we are going to review a couple of videos
[02:08:57.690 --> 02:08:59.410]  that we watched, and we'll actually watch a video
[02:08:59.410 --> 02:09:00.250]  on the air.
[02:09:00.250 --> 02:09:01.070]  Guys, stick around.
[02:09:01.070 --> 02:09:01.910]  We're gonna take a fat dab.
[02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:03.290]  Everybody at the table got super chatty
[02:09:03.290 --> 02:09:05.210]  as soon as I decided to turn off the mic.
[02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:06.590]  Turn the mics back on.
[02:09:06.590 --> 02:09:07.410]  No, they're back on.
[02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:08.250]  Oh, okay.
[02:09:08.250 --> 02:09:10.950]  I was like, dude, we weren't fucking,
[02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:12.870]  we were sitting there waiting for you to pay the bills
[02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:15.550]  and pay the dues and stuff like that.
[02:09:15.550 --> 02:09:16.550]  All that shit's important.
[02:09:16.550 --> 02:09:18.250]  I'm gonna take a dab on the show
[02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:20.710]  since the mics came back on.
[02:09:20.710 --> 02:09:23.670]  I'm gonna give a big shout out while I heat up the nail.
[02:09:23.670 --> 02:09:24.990]  Somebody remind me of the name of this place.
[02:09:24.990 --> 02:09:26.190]  God, I feel like an asshole because I forgot.
[02:09:26.190 --> 02:09:27.030]  I wasn't with you.
[02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:29.430]  Higher Elevation Masterpiece Productions
[02:09:29.430 --> 02:09:30.910]  in Colorado Springs.
[02:09:30.910 --> 02:09:32.030]  I had a broken rig.
[02:09:32.030 --> 02:09:33.150]  The joint got broken off.
[02:09:33.150 --> 02:09:34.270]  It busted right off.
[02:09:34.290 --> 02:09:35.530]  My email pulled the nail off,
[02:09:35.530 --> 02:09:38.530]  pulled the joint right off and busted that shit.
[02:09:38.530 --> 02:09:40.570]  And I took it there and they charged me a good price
[02:09:40.570 --> 02:09:41.410]  and they fixed it.
[02:09:41.410 --> 02:09:43.570]  And this sucker looks brand new, bro.
[02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:44.410]  It looks beautiful.
[02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:45.250]  It looks gorgeous.
[02:09:45.250 --> 02:09:46.070]  You can't tell it's a repair.
[02:09:46.070 --> 02:09:47.010]  It hits brand new.
[02:09:47.010 --> 02:09:48.490]  They did it in a timely manner.
[02:09:48.490 --> 02:09:49.610]  The price was right.
[02:09:49.610 --> 02:09:51.290]  And the little chick that works there is super sweet.
[02:09:51.290 --> 02:09:52.170]  She's super friendly.
[02:09:52.170 --> 02:09:53.630]  I'll go back there when I need a repair.
[02:09:53.630 --> 02:09:55.450]  Hopefully I don't ever need a damn repair.
[02:09:55.450 --> 02:09:56.270]  I'm gonna take a dab.
[02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:57.970]  Why don't you guys talk about something chaotic?
[02:09:57.970 --> 02:10:00.930]  We went there and I mean, we were looking,
[02:10:00.930 --> 02:10:02.010]  he was looking for a rig,
[02:10:02.010 --> 02:10:04.130]  but they had tons of little tiny rigs.
[02:10:04.950 --> 02:10:05.870]  I mean, little tiny miniature cakes
[02:10:05.870 --> 02:10:06.950]  like his phase two over there.
[02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:08.470]  That was, I mean, maybe this big,
[02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:10.790]  the smaller shake, you know, for only,
[02:10:10.790 --> 02:10:12.230]  you know, they weren't bad prices.
[02:10:12.230 --> 02:10:13.510]  Two, three inches off the table.
[02:10:13.510 --> 02:10:16.550]  Not even that, not three inches, maybe two and a half.
[02:10:16.550 --> 02:10:19.790]  But compared to what we have here locally in town,
[02:10:19.790 --> 02:10:21.830]  you know, it was definitely,
[02:10:21.830 --> 02:10:22.910]  it had more selection.
[02:10:22.910 --> 02:10:24.710]  They just had shit crammed in cases.
[02:10:24.710 --> 02:10:26.990]  Like they barely had room, you know,
[02:10:26.990 --> 02:10:28.430]  but there was definitely selection
[02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:31.030]  and anything that you could imagine.
[02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:33.550]  So it was definitely a cool place.
[02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:35.770]  I met a friendly dude in there that was,
[02:10:35.770 --> 02:10:38.490]  you know, he was talkative and he had some,
[02:10:38.490 --> 02:10:41.810]  some golden goat or something.
[02:10:41.810 --> 02:10:42.890]  Was it goat or was it?
[02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:44.130]  Yeah, it's some golden goat hash.
[02:10:44.130 --> 02:10:44.970]  All right.
[02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:45.810]  You know, he didn't really have anything
[02:10:45.810 --> 02:10:46.650]  to do with the store though.
[02:10:46.650 --> 02:10:47.570]  So don't go expecting some.
[02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:49.410]  Okay, well, I didn't know if he had anything.
[02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:50.610]  He was just hanging out in there,
[02:10:50.610 --> 02:10:51.930]  throwing people his hash.
[02:10:51.930 --> 02:10:53.690]  Yeah, he was just a customer trying to be social.
[02:10:53.690 --> 02:10:55.450]  I've never known any place that can fix
[02:10:55.450 --> 02:10:57.610]  a broken piece before.
[02:10:57.610 --> 02:10:58.850]  You break a piece, it's gone.
[02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:00.410]  Say goodbye, bury that sucker.
[02:11:00.410 --> 02:11:02.450]  And this looks brand new people.
[02:11:02.470 --> 02:11:04.310]  So you might be able to save it.
[02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:05.910]  I don't know if I got a hookup or anything
[02:11:05.910 --> 02:11:07.870]  cause they kind of, I've been in there a little bit,
[02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:09.310]  but the price they charged me,
[02:11:09.310 --> 02:11:11.710]  I was blown away at how cheap it was.
[02:11:11.710 --> 02:11:14.190]  As far as I'm concerned, it's a miracle.
[02:11:14.190 --> 02:11:15.030]  So they made me drop.
[02:11:15.030 --> 02:11:16.270]  I didn't know this was a thing before.
[02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:18.630]  They made me drop a deposit on it, which was cheap,
[02:11:18.630 --> 02:11:20.590]  but whatever.
[02:11:20.590 --> 02:11:22.510]  You pay the deposit to have it repaired.
[02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:23.330]  They repair it.
[02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:25.390]  And if they break it, when it's getting repaired,
[02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:28.350]  you get a 30% off the rig of your choice in the store.
[02:11:28.350 --> 02:11:29.190]  Oh, nice.
[02:11:29.190 --> 02:11:30.010]  Yeah.
[02:11:30.010 --> 02:11:30.850]  My voice will come back.
[02:11:30.850 --> 02:11:31.790]  I sound weird cause I just took a dab.
[02:11:32.130 --> 02:11:34.130]  I'm all choked up trying to get this dab going for Adam.
[02:11:34.130 --> 02:11:37.010]  So it was wider here, correct?
[02:11:37.010 --> 02:11:38.370]  And now it's thinner right there.
[02:11:38.370 --> 02:11:40.610]  No, it tapered just like that.
[02:11:40.610 --> 02:11:41.450]  Yeah.
[02:11:41.450 --> 02:11:43.930]  It looks like they cut it off right at the top of,
[02:11:43.930 --> 02:11:46.450]  cause I broke it right where the new joint, the line is.
[02:11:46.450 --> 02:11:47.290]  I broke it right.
[02:11:47.290 --> 02:11:49.490]  The old one broke right there anyway.
[02:11:49.490 --> 02:11:50.370]  So they just cleaned it up
[02:11:50.370 --> 02:11:52.170]  and put a new one on nice and clean.
[02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:54.170]  That one's you.
[02:11:54.170 --> 02:11:55.010]  And then I guess that one's you as well.
[02:11:55.010 --> 02:11:56.050]  There's a dab for Mike.
[02:11:56.050 --> 02:11:57.770]  Mike's going to cough forever after this.
[02:11:57.770 --> 02:11:59.170]  So you guys be prepared.
[02:11:59.170 --> 02:12:00.250]  Yeah, sorry folks.
[02:12:00.350 --> 02:12:01.190]  Hmm.
[02:12:01.190 --> 02:12:04.070]  It's really good hash that.
[02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:05.870]  So give him a shout out.
[02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:06.710]  It's Turpex.
[02:12:06.710 --> 02:12:08.010]  Yeah, Turpex.
[02:12:08.010 --> 02:12:10.070]  Dude, you guys killed it.
[02:12:10.070 --> 02:12:13.750]  Gatsby, I shouted you guys out last week and you got it,
[02:12:13.750 --> 02:12:18.230]  but we're dabbing some super lemon haze right now.
[02:12:18.230 --> 02:12:21.190]  And it's, once it hits the back of your throat,
[02:12:21.190 --> 02:12:23.030]  it's definitely lemon.
[02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:24.710]  That's like, this one's my stash.
[02:12:24.710 --> 02:12:26.510]  I've had this set aside for a little while.
[02:12:26.510 --> 02:12:27.870]  There's a reason.
[02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:30.370]  I had some of the sour grapes
[02:12:30.370 --> 02:12:34.930]  and it was some of the better shatter that I've tasted here.
[02:12:34.930 --> 02:12:39.490]  So big shout out to those guys up there
[02:12:39.490 --> 02:12:40.730]  and Springs rocking it.
[02:12:40.730 --> 02:12:41.570]  Jordan and Jordan.
[02:12:41.570 --> 02:12:43.970]  This is why you don't smoke tobacco people.
[02:12:43.970 --> 02:12:45.490]  Yeah, you hear Mike over there trying to die.
[02:12:45.490 --> 02:12:47.050]  It's like he needs oxygen.
[02:12:47.050 --> 02:12:49.350]  He needs scuba gear just to do a podcast, bro.
[02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:51.650]  I'll pull a couple of things off.
[02:12:51.650 --> 02:12:52.650]  We've all been there.
[02:12:52.650 --> 02:12:54.210]  We've all been there.
[02:12:54.210 --> 02:12:57.450]  Except for you, who is iron lunged.
[02:12:57.990 --> 02:12:59.190]  Sometimes dude, at the end of the day it hurts.
[02:12:59.190 --> 02:13:00.030]  And I don't,
[02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:01.910]  sometimes I have to wait until 7, 10 in the evening
[02:13:01.910 --> 02:13:03.190]  to take a good dab.
[02:13:03.190 --> 02:13:04.030]  I wait a while.
[02:13:04.030 --> 02:13:04.870]  I cough a couple of times.
[02:13:04.870 --> 02:13:06.710]  It's not every time, but yeah.
[02:13:06.710 --> 02:13:08.710]  The gram dab did not make me cough though.
[02:13:08.710 --> 02:13:11.710]  No, you hit that thing for two and a half minutes.
[02:13:11.710 --> 02:13:13.310]  I was doing what I do, bro.
[02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:15.830]  If you dab much at all or with people at all,
[02:13:15.830 --> 02:13:17.470]  you speak quickly.
[02:13:17.470 --> 02:13:20.990]  If you smoke tobacco, you dab and then you sound like me.
[02:13:22.990 --> 02:13:23.830]  I'm in Mike's boat.
[02:13:23.830 --> 02:13:25.350]  If you just consume cannabis,
[02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:26.990]  you dab and sound like Jeff.
[02:13:28.390 --> 02:13:30.190]  You sound like this on the radio?
[02:13:30.190 --> 02:13:31.030]  Yep.
[02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:33.270]  You sound like you should be a radio host.
[02:13:33.270 --> 02:13:34.750]  That is a face for radio, sir.
[02:13:34.750 --> 02:13:36.670]  All right, let's bring this meeting to order.
[02:13:36.670 --> 02:13:37.510]  All right.
[02:13:38.650 --> 02:13:40.190]  So we talked a little bit about the meeting.
[02:13:40.190 --> 02:13:42.150]  Mike was kind enough to show up to the grow meeting
[02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:44.630]  hosted by Hygro indoor growing supplies last night.
[02:13:44.630 --> 02:13:45.710]  That was awesome.
[02:13:45.710 --> 02:13:46.870]  That's funny.
[02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:47.710]  I got a text.
[02:13:47.710 --> 02:13:48.950]  I said, I eat too much and I can't move.
[02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:50.350]  And they're supposed to bring me food.
[02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:52.910]  So I wonder if that means that I'm not getting food.
[02:13:52.910 --> 02:13:54.270]  Oh, it's a good time.
[02:13:54.650 --> 02:13:59.050]  It was more mingle than a lesson time.
[02:13:59.050 --> 02:14:00.370]  But I liked that.
[02:14:00.370 --> 02:14:01.650]  It was nice.
[02:14:01.650 --> 02:14:04.850]  The lesson was, I think I realized about halfway through
[02:14:04.850 --> 02:14:07.090]  that most of us were probably able to do everything
[02:14:07.090 --> 02:14:08.210]  that Jesse was teaching,
[02:14:08.210 --> 02:14:12.130]  but I'm glad he took that as his first teaching opportunity
[02:14:12.130 --> 02:14:14.130]  because he's good now, dude.
[02:14:14.130 --> 02:14:16.570]  He's learning and he's catching up.
[02:14:16.570 --> 02:14:19.070]  Being on this podcast has really made him a better speaker.
[02:14:19.070 --> 02:14:20.290]  So now he's able to do that.
[02:14:20.290 --> 02:14:21.690]  I think the next couple of lessons,
[02:14:21.690 --> 02:14:23.210]  Jesse's going to really crush it.
[02:14:23.230 --> 02:14:24.550]  I picked a bad spot.
[02:14:24.550 --> 02:14:27.710]  Like if I tried to watch Jesse while he was talking,
[02:14:27.710 --> 02:14:29.990]  I would have been watching his back.
[02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:32.630]  So I was watching everyone else watch Jesse.
[02:14:32.630 --> 02:14:36.390]  And I mean, cloning isn't complicated,
[02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:39.070]  but he went over all the steps real quick.
[02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:42.630]  And at one point, everybody in the room pretty much went,
[02:14:42.630 --> 02:14:44.710]  oh yeah.
[02:14:44.710 --> 02:14:48.270]  And took a second to pull their phone out or grab a pen
[02:14:48.270 --> 02:14:49.430]  and jot down a little note.
[02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:51.750]  Like I should use this product
[02:14:51.770 --> 02:14:54.330]  or I'm keeping it too wet or too dry or over
[02:14:54.330 --> 02:14:57.410]  or under watering or I mean, just little simple stuff.
[02:14:57.410 --> 02:15:00.570]  Yeah, it was definitely the little talk afterward,
[02:15:00.570 --> 02:15:01.970]  the fine tuning talk about,
[02:15:01.970 --> 02:15:03.250]  oh, you're probably over watering.
[02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:04.090]  If that's what you're doing,
[02:15:04.090 --> 02:15:05.010]  you're probably under watering.
[02:15:05.010 --> 02:15:05.850]  That's what was cool.
[02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:07.870]  That's what was really valuable after that.
[02:15:07.870 --> 02:15:09.270]  But dude, Jesse did a really good job.
[02:15:09.270 --> 02:15:10.110]  I'm super proud of him.
[02:15:10.110 --> 02:15:11.450]  So you listened to the show, bro.
[02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:12.290]  Shout out, man.
[02:15:12.290 --> 02:15:13.110]  Good job.
[02:15:13.110 --> 02:15:13.950]  You did a really good job.
[02:15:13.950 --> 02:15:14.790]  We wanted to say that.
[02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:16.770]  And also I'm all choked up.
[02:15:16.770 --> 02:15:17.990]  Also huge shout out to Bern.
[02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:19.650]  She lets us throw a party back there
[02:15:19.650 --> 02:15:20.490]  in the back of the store.
[02:15:20.490 --> 02:15:21.310]  That's really cool.
[02:15:21.730 --> 02:15:22.570]  It's kind of her store.
[02:15:22.570 --> 02:15:23.410]  It's her baby.
[02:15:23.410 --> 02:15:25.290]  So thanks for letting us make a mess in your place.
[02:15:25.290 --> 02:15:27.850]  You got like 12 dudes hanging out back there.
[02:15:27.850 --> 02:15:32.850]  And thank you for the invite to the social gathering there.
[02:15:32.890 --> 02:15:33.730]  Yes.
[02:15:33.730 --> 02:15:34.550]  Thank you.
[02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:35.750]  Yeah, we have a good time there.
[02:15:35.750 --> 02:15:37.050]  Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[02:15:37.050 --> 02:15:38.770]  We'll do that every month
[02:15:38.770 --> 02:15:40.390]  and we'll announce the dates on this show.
[02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:42.210]  We try to get as many people as we can.
[02:15:42.210 --> 02:15:44.130]  Armando, bro, I look forward to you being there.
[02:15:44.130 --> 02:15:45.090]  I'm sorry you couldn't make it.
[02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:47.930]  Hopefully we can have another one in December.
[02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:48.750]  Yep.
[02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:49.590]  December is kind of rough for everybody.
[02:15:49.610 --> 02:15:50.970]  There's a lot of holidays there
[02:15:50.970 --> 02:15:52.410]  for all the different religious groups.
[02:15:52.410 --> 02:15:53.250]  You gotta have.
[02:15:53.250 --> 02:15:55.110]  They are talking about doing a December event.
[02:15:55.110 --> 02:15:58.470]  They brought it up at least twice last night.
[02:15:58.470 --> 02:16:00.130]  I just don't remember what the date was.
[02:16:00.130 --> 02:16:02.050]  I don't think they've have one nailed down yet.
[02:16:02.050 --> 02:16:04.450]  I have a little space, a big space heater.
[02:16:04.450 --> 02:16:06.770]  If we decided to do it back there in December
[02:16:06.770 --> 02:16:08.570]  cause it was a little chilly, bro.
[02:16:08.570 --> 02:16:09.430]  It's Colorado.
[02:16:09.430 --> 02:16:11.630]  Sometimes chilly is what happens.
[02:16:11.630 --> 02:16:16.630]  And if a room is that vapor filled, we'll go with.
[02:16:17.090 --> 02:16:17.930]  It was a private party.
[02:16:17.930 --> 02:16:18.750]  You gotta open the door.
[02:16:18.750 --> 02:16:19.590]  Private party things happen.
[02:16:19.590 --> 02:16:21.410]  Yeah, that's why it's invite only, huh?
[02:16:21.410 --> 02:16:22.250]  Yes.
[02:16:22.250 --> 02:16:23.090]  Yeah, it's a.
[02:16:23.090 --> 02:16:26.090]  What about you were saying the larger area
[02:16:26.090 --> 02:16:27.450]  towards the outside of town
[02:16:27.450 --> 02:16:30.730]  that maybe you would be able to got at one point in time?
[02:16:30.730 --> 02:16:32.730]  Yeah, that's in the future.
[02:16:32.730 --> 02:16:34.410]  We're definitely looking at another social club.
[02:16:34.410 --> 02:16:36.810]  It'll be a private party thing that will be an invite.
[02:16:36.810 --> 02:16:39.850]  Well, I was just thinking for that since it was no heat.
[02:16:39.850 --> 02:16:41.250]  It works perfectly so far.
[02:16:41.250 --> 02:16:43.050]  We like doing it at the store because then I'm down.
[02:16:43.050 --> 02:16:45.210]  I talk about a product and I can run down the hallway
[02:16:45.210 --> 02:16:46.890]  and grab it and be like, this is what it looks like.
[02:16:46.890 --> 02:16:48.710]  A whole bunch of people left with stuff.
[02:16:49.670 --> 02:16:50.510]  Which was awesome.
[02:16:50.510 --> 02:16:51.930]  I left, okay, I told this story once,
[02:16:51.930 --> 02:16:54.010]  but I'm sitting there, the night's pretty much over.
[02:16:54.010 --> 02:16:55.570]  A whole bunch of people left with products
[02:16:55.570 --> 02:16:57.610]  that they bought after the grow lesson
[02:16:57.610 --> 02:16:58.570]  is what I was going for.
[02:16:58.570 --> 02:17:00.330]  But there were a bunch of people that left with stuff
[02:17:00.330 --> 02:17:01.170]  like you left with stuff.
[02:17:01.170 --> 02:17:02.930]  People were giving, they give out gifts.
[02:17:02.930 --> 02:17:05.130]  They definitely give out prizes and shit for people coming.
[02:17:05.130 --> 02:17:07.690]  We're gonna start doing contests and shit also.
[02:17:07.690 --> 02:17:08.890]  We're just getting it started.
[02:17:08.890 --> 02:17:09.710]  We don't know what we're doing.
[02:17:09.710 --> 02:17:10.910]  This isn't our forte.
[02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:12.410]  We just decided that it needed to be,
[02:17:12.410 --> 02:17:14.770]  Jesse decided, I'm taking credit for nothing.
[02:17:14.770 --> 02:17:16.670]  Jesse did all of this.
[02:17:16.670 --> 02:17:18.090]  He decided that this needed to happen.
[02:17:18.110 --> 02:17:19.990]  So he's learning and I'm helping him learn.
[02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:22.030]  They've got a hell of a little shop down there.
[02:17:22.030 --> 02:17:24.630]  Wouldn't you say that you two kind of inspire each other?
[02:17:24.630 --> 02:17:26.150]  We completely inspire each other.
[02:17:26.150 --> 02:17:27.350]  I've been talking about it on the show.
[02:17:27.350 --> 02:17:30.350]  Jesse is now kind of officially a part of Irie Genetics.
[02:17:30.350 --> 02:17:32.910]  He's breeding seeds that will be available.
[02:17:32.910 --> 02:17:35.070]  As far as I think our plan goes,
[02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:36.930]  there'll be in Irie Genetics packaging
[02:17:36.930 --> 02:17:38.470]  and on the Irie Genetics website,
[02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:40.110]  we're just gonna add them to here
[02:17:40.110 --> 02:17:41.990]  and I'll give Jesse credit.
[02:17:41.990 --> 02:17:42.810]  You know what I mean?
[02:17:42.810 --> 02:17:44.790]  Jesse is now breeding, it's not all me,
[02:17:44.790 --> 02:17:46.710]  those strains that, there'll be specific strains
[02:17:46.710 --> 02:17:47.550]  that he does.
[02:17:48.390 --> 02:17:50.770]  So I'm sitting there at the Hygro meeting.
[02:17:50.770 --> 02:17:53.330]  I'm chilling, talking to people just like we do, bullshit.
[02:17:53.330 --> 02:17:54.770]  And I'm nice and dabbed out.
[02:17:54.770 --> 02:17:57.650]  And Jesse comes up and he slides a NanoLux 1000 watt light,
[02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:58.970]  a full kit right in front of me.
[02:17:58.970 --> 02:17:59.970]  And he goes, here man, run this
[02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:01.330]  and let me know what you think.
[02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:02.810]  And I was like, shocked,
[02:18:02.810 --> 02:18:04.530]  I think is the only word I can come up with.
[02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:06.530]  Christmas doesn't just appear in front of you
[02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:10.930]  like on a Friday in November.
[02:18:10.930 --> 02:18:13.290]  And it did last night for you and it was fun to watch.
[02:18:13.290 --> 02:18:14.110]  Yeah, it was kind of neat.
[02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:17.130]  I was confused because I'm not used to getting a big,
[02:18:17.630 --> 02:18:18.470]  that's a big ass gift to get.
[02:18:18.470 --> 02:18:19.310]  That's a nice.
[02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:20.310]  Yeah, that was huge.
[02:18:20.310 --> 02:18:21.750]  I didn't see it coming.
[02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:24.030]  And when I saw Jesse give it to you, I was like, wow.
[02:18:24.030 --> 02:18:24.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:26.030]  But look at this way though,
[02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:28.670]  in three months when you come back to him,
[02:18:28.670 --> 02:18:31.830]  like, do you do like a trading credit?
[02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:33.710]  Can I take, will you take these five
[02:18:33.710 --> 02:18:35.750]  and can I get four more of those?
[02:18:35.750 --> 02:18:38.070]  You know, like that'll speak volumes.
[02:18:38.070 --> 02:18:38.910]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:18:38.910 --> 02:18:41.950]  I'll definitely shout that it's NanoLux is the company.
[02:18:41.950 --> 02:18:43.790]  NanoLux and Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies
[02:18:43.790 --> 02:18:45.390]  get mad respect from me.
[02:18:45.410 --> 02:18:47.330]  Check out my, on Instagram,
[02:18:47.330 --> 02:18:49.730]  I post a lot of stuff as iRegenetics.
[02:18:49.730 --> 02:18:51.690]  That's me, look there.
[02:18:51.690 --> 02:18:54.170]  That light really honestly won't get hung until December.
[02:18:54.170 --> 02:18:55.530]  I've got a crop that's growing
[02:18:55.530 --> 02:18:57.010]  in the room where that will go.
[02:18:57.010 --> 02:18:59.090]  And when that crop finishes, that light will go up
[02:18:59.090 --> 02:19:00.850]  and then we'll start under there.
[02:19:00.850 --> 02:19:02.810]  And if it kicks as much ass as it appears,
[02:19:02.810 --> 02:19:04.650]  if it, you know, as it looks,
[02:19:04.650 --> 02:19:07.650]  you'll be in the shop buying three more of them here
[02:19:07.650 --> 02:19:08.570]  come March.
[02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:10.490]  I'll buy four or five more.
[02:19:10.490 --> 02:19:11.770]  My only concern is venting.
[02:19:11.770 --> 02:19:13.690]  Those don't match up with my venting style.
[02:19:13.690 --> 02:19:15.050]  So I can only run those in the winter.
[02:19:15.950 --> 02:19:18.150]  But I can, you know, if they kick as much ass
[02:19:18.150 --> 02:19:20.470]  as people have been saying, I can readjust my rooms.
[02:19:20.470 --> 02:19:22.430]  All I have to do is change air conditioning.
[02:19:22.430 --> 02:19:24.310]  Right, I could just go change up a little bit.
[02:19:24.310 --> 02:19:25.910]  Couldn't you just shorten the pipes
[02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:28.630]  and kind of ducked out from the main room
[02:19:28.630 --> 02:19:31.390]  from top and filter into the bottom, you know,
[02:19:31.390 --> 02:19:33.630]  cool air in, hot air out.
[02:19:33.630 --> 02:19:35.190]  But the lights I'm running now are ducted.
[02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:36.750]  So the heat from the lights I'm running now
[02:19:36.750 --> 02:19:39.630]  doesn't ever make it to the room and those are not ducted.
[02:19:39.630 --> 02:19:42.830]  It's the only downside that I'm seeing right now.
[02:19:43.370 --> 02:19:45.930]  It's all one unit, which I've never seen before.
[02:19:45.930 --> 02:19:49.210]  The ballast and the light is all usually separated.
[02:19:49.210 --> 02:19:52.330]  This is all one solid, really well-built unit.
[02:19:52.330 --> 02:19:53.650]  At least it looks like it's well built.
[02:19:53.650 --> 02:19:55.490]  It's much lighter than it looks also.
[02:19:55.490 --> 02:19:57.970]  It looks like it's heavy as hell, but it's really light.
[02:19:57.970 --> 02:19:58.810]  Nice.
[02:19:58.810 --> 02:19:59.650]  Yeah.
[02:19:59.650 --> 02:20:01.890]  All right, so let's do this since we're talking about this.
[02:20:01.890 --> 02:20:03.210]  Where did I set that one?
[02:20:03.210 --> 02:20:04.450]  Here it is, you ready?
[02:20:04.450 --> 02:20:05.290]  I'm ready.
[02:20:05.290 --> 02:20:06.290]  This podcast is brought to you
[02:20:06.290 --> 02:20:09.210]  by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:20:09.210 --> 02:20:11.410]  Yeah, that happened just like that.
[02:20:11.430 --> 02:20:13.350]  Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies has two locations
[02:20:13.350 --> 02:20:14.270]  to serve Colorado.
[02:20:14.270 --> 02:20:17.830]  Visit the Denver store at 6271 Beach Street
[02:20:17.830 --> 02:20:19.830]  or check out the Pueblo location
[02:20:19.830 --> 02:20:22.350]  at 618 East 4th Street in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:20:22.350 --> 02:20:24.630]  Check out Hygro for competitive pricing
[02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:27.430]  and a great selection of indoor grow supplies.
[02:20:27.430 --> 02:20:29.630]  Hygro, I got to catch up with myself.
[02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:32.110]  Hygro is running a special for the podcast listeners.
[02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:33.150]  When you check out at Hygro,
[02:20:33.150 --> 02:20:35.550]  tell them you listen to the Hygro Culture Podcast
[02:20:35.550 --> 02:20:37.350]  and they will give you commercial pricing
[02:20:37.350 --> 02:20:39.630]  on your entire purchase.
[02:20:39.630 --> 02:20:40.470]  That's so cool.
[02:20:40.470 --> 02:20:41.290]  That's a sweet deal.
[02:20:42.130 --> 02:20:42.970]  I was talking about it the other night.
[02:20:42.970 --> 02:20:44.710]  I bought a bag of dirt,
[02:20:44.710 --> 02:20:47.990]  that bag of dirt that you see part of it on the ground there.
[02:20:47.990 --> 02:20:49.870]  That bag of dirt is a $25 bag of dirt.
[02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:52.590]  I paid about $18, it was $17 and some jingles,
[02:20:52.590 --> 02:20:56.210]  some change in there for that bag of dirt out the door
[02:20:56.210 --> 02:20:57.510]  because I paid commercial pricing.
[02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:59.390]  That's a hell of a deal.
[02:20:59.390 --> 02:21:02.470]  We pay what the dispensaries pay is what our pricing is.
[02:21:02.470 --> 02:21:03.870]  If you use that code,
[02:21:03.870 --> 02:21:06.550]  if you tell them I listen to the Hygro Culture Podcast.
[02:21:06.550 --> 02:21:07.390]  Hey, the same price as-
[02:21:07.390 --> 02:21:08.310]  It's a good deal.
[02:21:08.310 --> 02:21:09.150]  Yeah.
[02:21:09.150 --> 02:21:09.970]  Oh dude, it's helpful.
[02:21:09.970 --> 02:21:10.810]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:21:11.310 --> 02:21:12.310]  Someone like me, you know what I'm saying?
[02:21:12.310 --> 02:21:13.710]  Someone low budget.
[02:21:13.710 --> 02:21:14.550]  Yeah.
[02:21:14.550 --> 02:21:15.390]  So low budget.
[02:21:15.390 --> 02:21:16.670]  Low budget, if you're listening,
[02:21:16.670 --> 02:21:18.750]  hey, you could save yourself some money there.
[02:21:18.750 --> 02:21:20.270]  It's coupons, coupons.
[02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:22.590]  Some coupons.
[02:21:22.590 --> 02:21:24.550]  Speaking of couponing, shout out to Matty.
[02:21:24.550 --> 02:21:26.190]  What up Matty, you're the coupon queen.
[02:21:26.190 --> 02:21:27.590]  It's good to see you back in action, dude.
[02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:28.830]  You looked good last night.
[02:21:28.830 --> 02:21:30.630]  Dude, I saw Spence last night.
[02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:31.870]  Spence is back in action.
[02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:33.110]  Back on his feet.
[02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:36.030]  Oh, that dude weighs 140 pounds now.
[02:21:36.030 --> 02:21:38.970]  He's about six, he's somewhere between six four and six five
[02:21:38.970 --> 02:21:40.150]  depending on who you ask.
[02:21:40.170 --> 02:21:41.970]  I never run into people taller than me.
[02:21:41.970 --> 02:21:42.810]  He's one of the few.
[02:21:42.810 --> 02:21:45.890]  Yeah, and he's 140 pounds, dude.
[02:21:45.890 --> 02:21:48.010]  So you guys send him some calories.
[02:21:48.010 --> 02:21:50.770]  If you can mentally put calories on my brother Spence,
[02:21:50.770 --> 02:21:52.090]  just send them right to him
[02:21:52.090 --> 02:21:54.250]  because he needs some help right now.
[02:21:54.250 --> 02:21:57.330]  I feel it because, you know, pressure's coming in.
[02:21:57.330 --> 02:22:00.730]  So wish him luck and glad to see he's back home.
[02:22:00.730 --> 02:22:02.570]  That's, mm.
[02:22:02.570 --> 02:22:04.250]  Are you wishing him luck for the secret cup?
[02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:05.090]  Mm.
[02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.930]  Is that what you're wishing him luck for?
[02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:07.130]  That may be what I'm wishing him.
[02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:08.130]  He knows what I mean.
[02:22:08.130 --> 02:22:09.530]  Well, the secret cup is coming up.
[02:22:10.390 --> 02:22:11.230]  It's coming up.
[02:22:11.230 --> 02:22:12.050]  The finals.
[02:22:12.050 --> 02:22:12.890]  The finals.
[02:22:12.890 --> 02:22:13.730]  And I expect that to be-
[02:22:13.730 --> 02:22:15.150]  In Las Vegas.
[02:22:15.150 --> 02:22:16.990]  You think, no, I don't think.
[02:22:16.990 --> 02:22:18.870]  About December 15th-ish?
[02:22:18.870 --> 02:22:20.590]  Because that's around when he'll be back, I predict.
[02:22:20.590 --> 02:22:22.070]  You know, I'm just guessing, being hypothetical here.
[02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:23.390]  But the second week of December,
[02:22:23.390 --> 02:22:24.910]  maybe the beginning of the third week of December,
[02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:26.390]  you think right here in Mike's chair,
[02:22:26.390 --> 02:22:29.310]  you think we'll have the secret cup winner,
[02:22:29.310 --> 02:22:31.830]  Garden of Whedon and his lovely lady, Maddie,
[02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:33.190]  sitting right next to us right here?
[02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:34.590]  If you do, can I be in the chair
[02:22:34.590 --> 02:22:35.990]  that's behind the dab stuff?
[02:22:35.990 --> 02:22:36.830]  You can.
[02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:38.150]  Like, I'll just sit in the corner and be quiet.
[02:22:38.730 --> 02:22:40.050]  The chair with no mic.
[02:22:40.050 --> 02:22:42.090]  Because there's a chair that sometimes people sit in
[02:22:42.090 --> 02:22:43.010]  and there's no mic.
[02:22:43.010 --> 02:22:44.210]  The mic sits right here next to me.
[02:22:44.210 --> 02:22:45.690]  I could fire this mic up, but-
[02:22:46.970 --> 02:22:49.250]  It's got a droopy stand, from what I understand.
[02:22:49.250 --> 02:22:51.970]  It does, but I've got a replacement.
[02:22:51.970 --> 02:22:53.330]  Sometimes people don't want to be heard
[02:22:53.330 --> 02:22:54.730]  and they just sit here and dish out dabs
[02:22:54.730 --> 02:22:57.810]  and just sit on the podcast and just watch.
[02:22:57.810 --> 02:22:58.810]  And then I'd look them in the eye
[02:22:58.810 --> 02:23:00.010]  when I do the intro and stuff
[02:23:00.010 --> 02:23:01.290]  and I have someone to talk to.
[02:23:01.290 --> 02:23:02.810]  When you hear those lively ass intros,
[02:23:02.810 --> 02:23:04.810]  they're all, what's up guys, welcome to another episode.
[02:23:04.810 --> 02:23:06.850]  That's because there's someone here to fire me up.
[02:23:06.850 --> 02:23:07.690]  Nice.
[02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:09.630]  Adam's been here for a night.
[02:23:09.630 --> 02:23:11.910]  In the podcast world, when you're doing a microphone
[02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:14.470]  and you got a voice going and you got the energy,
[02:23:14.470 --> 02:23:15.670]  sometimes you fail.
[02:23:15.670 --> 02:23:17.550]  There was a night one night when Adam and I sat here
[02:23:17.550 --> 02:23:19.470]  for probably 45 minutes just going,
[02:23:19.470 --> 02:23:20.910]  so welcome to the fucking show.
[02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:22.990]  We are failing miserably with a rhythm
[02:23:22.990 --> 02:23:25.510]  and a conversation and a lesson.
[02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:27.190]  And you should probably fast forward
[02:23:27.190 --> 02:23:28.110]  through the rest of this show
[02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:29.910]  because tonight is not our flow.
[02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:31.310]  Just skip episode 12.
[02:23:31.310 --> 02:23:32.190]  That's kind of how it felt.
[02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:34.350]  We pulled it off eventually through the magic of editing
[02:23:34.350 --> 02:23:35.470]  and a lot of dabs.
[02:23:36.450 --> 02:23:39.410]  And throw some more shatter at the problem.
[02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:41.210]  I don't even want to talk about where it went.
[02:23:41.210 --> 02:23:42.850]  It just went, it was weird.
[02:23:44.410 --> 02:23:46.810]  Imaginary characters walked into the room.
[02:23:46.810 --> 02:23:49.010]  Let's put it that way on the podcast.
[02:23:51.210 --> 02:23:53.490]  Some of us might've been hearing voices.
[02:23:53.490 --> 02:23:55.210]  All right, so we've been,
[02:23:55.210 --> 02:23:57.450]  this is gonna be one of those episodes
[02:23:57.450 --> 02:23:58.290]  where we just kind of revel.
[02:23:58.290 --> 02:23:59.110]  If you're still listening, we love you.
[02:23:59.110 --> 02:24:01.330]  Tweet at us and we'll send you free shit.
[02:24:01.330 --> 02:24:03.170]  Wait, Mike said that, so tweet at Mike
[02:24:03.170 --> 02:24:04.410]  and he will send you free shit.
[02:24:04.430 --> 02:24:06.270]  It's not gonna be good free shit.
[02:24:06.270 --> 02:24:08.750]  It could be a big pen, but it'll be some free shit.
[02:24:08.750 --> 02:24:11.230]  Here's a pen I'd shoot on at city council one night.
[02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:12.870]  Congratulations, thanks for listening.
[02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:14.110]  There's something we can go into.
[02:24:14.110 --> 02:24:15.510]  What about any of that?
[02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:16.510]  Have you heard about any of that?
[02:24:16.510 --> 02:24:17.630]  You're the city council guy.
[02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:21.190]  All right, so since Adam wants to just run right in.
[02:24:21.190 --> 02:24:22.030]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:22.030 --> 02:24:22.870]  I do that every now and then.
[02:24:22.870 --> 02:24:24.510]  That's what my notes for, so.
[02:24:24.510 --> 02:24:27.350]  How much time do you think you can wrap that up
[02:24:27.350 --> 02:24:29.430]  in quite quickly and not bore the shit out of anybody?
[02:24:29.430 --> 02:24:31.590]  I condense everything you need to know
[02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:33.350]  into just a little paragraph or two.
[02:24:33.370 --> 02:24:34.970]  Guys, this may be local news
[02:24:34.970 --> 02:24:36.610]  for most of what we're doing here.
[02:24:36.610 --> 02:24:39.130]  This is happening in my town and in my county,
[02:24:39.130 --> 02:24:41.250]  so this is very pertinent to me.
[02:24:41.250 --> 02:24:42.370]  I'm a grower.
[02:24:43.610 --> 02:24:44.450]  I've got a home grow.
[02:24:44.450 --> 02:24:46.450]  I grow my personal medicine here in my house.
[02:24:46.450 --> 02:24:48.210]  I do some small stuff in my home
[02:24:48.210 --> 02:24:49.490]  because that's what we do.
[02:24:49.490 --> 02:24:50.690]  It's Colorado.
[02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:53.170]  Not everything has to happen in a large facility.
[02:24:53.170 --> 02:24:57.130]  I am Mike's medical marijuana provider and his caregiver.
[02:24:57.130 --> 02:24:59.490]  So what's happening pertains to Mike.
[02:25:00.410 --> 02:25:01.330]  In a very real way.
[02:25:01.330 --> 02:25:03.330]  They're trying to enforce rules upon me
[02:25:04.270 --> 02:25:05.330]  and my grow that will,
[02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:09.830]  it's gonna fuck with Mike's medicine supply.
[02:25:09.830 --> 02:25:11.510]  I've been trying to find a classier way to say that,
[02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:13.090]  but it's gonna hinder my production
[02:25:13.090 --> 02:25:14.310]  of Mike's quality medicine,
[02:25:14.310 --> 02:25:16.270]  and Mike relies on me for medicine.
[02:25:16.270 --> 02:25:17.710]  So Mike is going to city council.
[02:25:17.710 --> 02:25:19.350]  I keep cutting you off, but I'm setting you up good.
[02:25:19.350 --> 02:25:20.470]  Mike is going to city council
[02:25:20.470 --> 02:25:21.990]  to make sure this doesn't happen.
[02:25:21.990 --> 02:25:23.550]  So this is super important to me.
[02:25:23.550 --> 02:25:25.230]  This shit could happen in your area,
[02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:27.110]  and someone's gotta stand up and do what Mike does.
[02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:29.310]  So if you're doing that, I give you a huge shout out.
[02:25:29.310 --> 02:25:30.790]  I'm gonna turn it over to Mike for a couple minutes.
[02:25:30.790 --> 02:25:32.710]  Tell me what you learned at city council recently.
[02:25:33.290 --> 02:25:35.650]  So down here in Pueblo, Colorado,
[02:25:35.650 --> 02:25:37.670]  they're looking at passing home grow rules
[02:25:37.670 --> 02:25:39.410]  in the city and in the county.
[02:25:39.410 --> 02:25:41.130]  It's two very separate efforts.
[02:25:41.130 --> 02:25:43.850]  You have to go to two very separate meetings
[02:25:43.850 --> 02:25:46.210]  to be involved with this process.
[02:25:46.210 --> 02:25:50.010]  Right now, the planning and zoning department
[02:25:50.010 --> 02:25:52.850]  with the city has finalized their proposal.
[02:25:52.850 --> 02:25:55.450]  They're sending that recommendation onto city council.
[02:25:55.450 --> 02:25:57.770]  City council will receive it.
[02:25:57.770 --> 02:26:00.790]  I expect that to happen at their first meeting in December.
[02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:02.650]  That's December 8th.
[02:26:03.430 --> 02:26:06.910]  And then their final meeting in December, on December 22nd,
[02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:10.270]  they'll likely be taking public comment
[02:26:10.270 --> 02:26:13.970]  and a vote on these proposed home grow rules
[02:26:13.970 --> 02:26:17.190]  that will essentially limit every caregiver in Pueblo.
[02:26:17.190 --> 02:26:19.150]  They're really, really ugly rules, folks.
[02:26:19.150 --> 02:26:24.150]  You wanna get down to city council on the 22nd
[02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:27.430]  and speak out against these rules for sure.
[02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:29.830]  They're also, out in the county,
[02:26:29.850 --> 02:26:31.930]  that meeting is gonna be taking place
[02:26:31.930 --> 02:26:34.330]  on December 10th at 9 a.m.
[02:26:34.330 --> 02:26:37.050]  So that meeting's a little bit closer.
[02:26:37.050 --> 02:26:37.930]  Mark your calendars.
[02:26:37.930 --> 02:26:40.090]  If you can get down there, check that out.
[02:26:40.090 --> 02:26:44.090]  If you're interested in local Pueblo cannabis law news,
[02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:47.570]  check out Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[02:26:47.570 --> 02:26:50.290]  I'm trying to post this stuff up as fast as I can,
[02:26:50.290 --> 02:26:53.570]  but getting digital copies of the ordinances
[02:26:53.570 --> 02:26:55.170]  that I can easily post to Facebook
[02:26:55.170 --> 02:26:56.050]  has been a little tricky.
[02:26:56.050 --> 02:26:58.090]  But info about the meetings
[02:26:58.110 --> 02:26:59.470]  and what you can do to help out,
[02:26:59.470 --> 02:27:01.830]  that's the best place to look right now
[02:27:01.830 --> 02:27:04.430]  if you're looking for that kind of info.
[02:27:04.430 --> 02:27:06.070]  And that's essentially it, folks.
[02:27:08.110 --> 02:27:10.230]  And this is just mainly on caregivers?
[02:27:11.390 --> 02:27:12.350]  The rules are gonna,
[02:27:12.350 --> 02:27:15.590]  and the city and the county rules are different.
[02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:18.110]  This is an extension of what you already went to.
[02:27:18.110 --> 02:27:20.990]  Okay, I'll definitely go, for sure.
[02:27:20.990 --> 02:27:22.470]  Anything you need support on, brother.
[02:27:22.470 --> 02:27:24.190]  The rules as they stand right now,
[02:27:24.190 --> 02:27:25.550]  there's a whole lot of them.
[02:27:25.570 --> 02:27:28.370]  They don't make a whole lot of sense.
[02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:30.290]  I'm doing a whole bunch of private lobbying
[02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:31.130]  trying to stop them.
[02:27:31.130 --> 02:27:31.970]  Can you tell me an example
[02:27:31.970 --> 02:27:33.930]  of a couple of the stupid rules they're trying to put out?
[02:27:33.930 --> 02:27:36.690]  They're banning all CO2 usage
[02:27:36.690 --> 02:27:38.550]  in any sort of marijuana grow room.
[02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:40.330]  But the way they write that rule,
[02:27:40.330 --> 02:27:43.070]  I mean, it's dumb just on its face,
[02:27:43.070 --> 02:27:45.050]  but the way it's written would make it illegal
[02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:47.470]  to take the soda stream machine I have in my kitchen
[02:27:47.470 --> 02:27:49.330]  into a grow room and use it.
[02:27:49.330 --> 02:27:51.570]  I think that's a special new crime now.
[02:27:51.570 --> 02:27:52.850]  I'm glad you grabbed that one right away.
[02:27:52.850 --> 02:27:54.430]  That's a rule that I find ridiculous
[02:27:54.450 --> 02:27:55.970]  because there are people,
[02:27:57.690 --> 02:28:00.050]  he's talking about CO2 for CO2 augmentation.
[02:28:00.050 --> 02:28:02.230]  We run CO2 in grow rooms
[02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:05.490]  because the CO2 plants would thrive with more CO2
[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:07.770]  than what's naturally available in the atmosphere.
[02:28:07.770 --> 02:28:08.610]  In your natural grow,
[02:28:08.610 --> 02:28:10.930]  you probably have about three to 500,
[02:28:10.930 --> 02:28:14.770]  probably right around 400 particles per million of CO2.
[02:28:14.770 --> 02:28:16.130]  If you go to the HydroShop,
[02:28:17.050 --> 02:28:19.530]  they'll set you up with a system where you can get about,
[02:28:19.530 --> 02:28:22.610]  it would be cool if you could get about 1200 to 1800 PPMs
[02:28:22.610 --> 02:28:23.930]  of CO2 in the room.
[02:28:24.430 --> 02:28:25.510]  What that does is your plants breathe that
[02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:27.510]  and they grow much more vigorously.
[02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:29.190]  You get bigger buds, you get denser buds,
[02:28:29.190 --> 02:28:30.630]  you get larger plants,
[02:28:30.630 --> 02:28:33.150]  and it makes them grow more quickly.
[02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:35.470]  So tomato growers use this.
[02:28:35.470 --> 02:28:38.510]  All kinds of indoor plant growers use CO2.
[02:28:38.510 --> 02:28:39.790]  Any hydroponic.
[02:28:39.790 --> 02:28:42.190]  And all of these rules are written
[02:28:42.190 --> 02:28:44.030]  so that they could easily be applied
[02:28:44.030 --> 02:28:45.590]  to anybody doing the same thing
[02:28:45.590 --> 02:28:47.870]  with something that's not cannabis,
[02:28:47.870 --> 02:28:49.450]  but it's all cannabis specific,
[02:28:49.450 --> 02:28:50.830]  so they don't make a lot of sense.
[02:28:50.830 --> 02:28:52.910]  Hopefully the city council will see
[02:28:52.930 --> 02:28:55.530]  how much nonsense this is and kill it
[02:28:55.530 --> 02:28:57.930]  and send the whole matter back to planning
[02:28:57.930 --> 02:28:59.450]  and zoning for a redo.
[02:28:59.450 --> 02:29:01.410]  I just think it's dumb that they pick out CO2
[02:29:01.410 --> 02:29:03.570]  because the tomato farmer can go to the HydroShop
[02:29:03.570 --> 02:29:04.810]  and buy it and take it to his house
[02:29:04.810 --> 02:29:05.650]  and run it in the basement,
[02:29:05.650 --> 02:29:07.930]  just like Adam would in his basement grow,
[02:29:07.930 --> 02:29:10.250]  just like Mike would in his basement grow.
[02:29:10.250 --> 02:29:12.590]  A lot of the rules is someone,
[02:29:12.590 --> 02:29:15.570]  they heard something that sounded scary,
[02:29:15.570 --> 02:29:18.570]  and so they wrote a rule that says you can't do that.
[02:29:18.570 --> 02:29:21.610]  And because they don't know what they're talking about
[02:29:21.610 --> 02:29:23.150]  and the research didn't get done,
[02:29:23.150 --> 02:29:24.830]  a lot of the rules don't make sense.
[02:29:24.830 --> 02:29:27.030]  I've described it to other people
[02:29:27.030 --> 02:29:30.830]  as listening to a five-year-old lecture on calculus.
[02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:32.610]  It doesn't matter how much homework
[02:29:32.610 --> 02:29:34.630]  they did the night before.
[02:29:34.630 --> 02:29:37.990]  The lecture will be total nonsense from start to finish,
[02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:39.750]  and anyone not throwing rocks
[02:29:39.750 --> 02:29:41.430]  is doing so out of being polite.
[02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:43.910]  It's just painful to watch.
[02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:45.670]  The last time we went,
[02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:49.550]  two of the council at least seemed to be,
[02:29:49.570 --> 02:29:52.530]  I won't say pro pot, but not against it.
[02:29:52.530 --> 02:29:54.010]  Definitely.
[02:29:54.010 --> 02:29:56.410]  I wouldn't say anyone on council is pro pot,
[02:29:56.410 --> 02:29:59.250]  but there are some that are interested
[02:29:59.250 --> 02:30:02.090]  in what legal marijuana can do for the city.
[02:30:02.090 --> 02:30:04.570]  You know, they're still the minority of the vote.
[02:30:04.570 --> 02:30:05.910]  It's an uphill climb for sure,
[02:30:05.910 --> 02:30:08.650]  which is why I keep bringing it up on this podcast,
[02:30:08.650 --> 02:30:10.670]  because people need to show up to these meetings
[02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:11.850]  and start pitching in.
[02:30:11.850 --> 02:30:15.890]  If planning and zoning's work on the marijuana rules
[02:30:15.890 --> 02:30:18.730]  is indicative of their work on other rules,
[02:30:18.730 --> 02:30:21.870]  that might be an explanation into why nothing works here.
[02:30:21.870 --> 02:30:24.110]  Like, it might just be that nobody's paid attention
[02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:25.430]  to government for so long
[02:30:25.430 --> 02:30:29.950]  that they don't expect to get caught just doing nonsense.
[02:30:29.950 --> 02:30:31.310]  A lot of people aren't aware
[02:30:31.310 --> 02:30:34.070]  that we can just go to city council and sign up
[02:30:34.070 --> 02:30:36.590]  and sit at that little cozy chair with a microphone.
[02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:37.750]  Dude, it's cushy.
[02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:39.350]  It feels, they make the kind of,
[02:30:39.350 --> 02:30:41.370]  it's intimidating if you're not that kind of person,
[02:30:41.370 --> 02:30:44.510]  but the first time you go, I feel like I could go now
[02:30:44.510 --> 02:30:46.750]  if I had some real business to go deal with,
[02:30:46.750 --> 02:30:48.190]  I could go speak there.
[02:30:48.450 --> 02:30:49.410]  It's inviting.
[02:30:49.410 --> 02:30:50.250]  Anybody can go.
[02:30:50.250 --> 02:30:51.150]  You can go.
[02:30:51.150 --> 02:30:52.050]  Totally.
[02:30:52.050 --> 02:30:53.570]  Right now, Adam looks like a homeless person
[02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:54.410]  with headphones on.
[02:30:54.410 --> 02:30:55.250]  Absolutely.
[02:30:55.250 --> 02:30:57.610]  He's wearing an irie genetics hoodie that could use a wash.
[02:30:57.610 --> 02:30:58.450]  Probably.
[02:30:58.450 --> 02:31:00.290]  He's got some dreadlocks that are the same as the hoodie.
[02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:01.610]  They definitely could use a wash.
[02:31:01.610 --> 02:31:02.450]  Definitely.
[02:31:02.450 --> 02:31:03.650]  He's got a tore up green t-shirt under there.
[02:31:03.650 --> 02:31:04.530]  I can't see his pants,
[02:31:04.530 --> 02:31:06.530]  but his shoes are definitely muddy as crap.
[02:31:06.530 --> 02:31:08.250]  And with holes in the bottom of them.
[02:31:08.250 --> 02:31:10.570]  But dude, you're invited to go talk at city council.
[02:31:10.570 --> 02:31:12.490]  You can speak and nobody will judge you.
[02:31:12.490 --> 02:31:13.770]  They'll listen to what you have to say.
[02:31:13.770 --> 02:31:15.090]  They may judge you.
[02:31:15.090 --> 02:31:16.170]  I'm lying.
[02:31:16.190 --> 02:31:18.710]  I saw them definitely condescendingly judge one person
[02:31:18.710 --> 02:31:21.110]  for a few minutes and it was almost entertaining.
[02:31:21.110 --> 02:31:23.590]  But you can go speak and you can say your piece
[02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:26.510]  and you get, I think, five full solid minutes
[02:31:26.510 --> 02:31:28.030]  and they six, I believe.
[02:31:28.030 --> 02:31:29.070]  During public comment,
[02:31:29.070 --> 02:31:31.350]  they give anyone who wants to come and sign up
[02:31:31.350 --> 02:31:33.990]  five full minutes to speak on anything they'd like to.
[02:31:33.990 --> 02:31:35.390]  And this happens in every city.
[02:31:35.390 --> 02:31:37.670]  If you've got a city hall that has city council meetings,
[02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:39.150]  you can go and you can,
[02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:41.830]  even if it's something that one guy came and talked
[02:31:41.830 --> 02:31:43.990]  for six minutes about the bike lane.
[02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.830]  Right.
[02:31:45.090 --> 02:31:46.650]  Like how to use them.
[02:31:46.650 --> 02:31:48.410]  Yeah, I was going to say it felt like he was giving
[02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:50.690]  the city council a lesson on how to use bike lanes,
[02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:52.430]  but I think he was asking for more funding
[02:31:52.430 --> 02:31:54.890]  to create more bike lanes was his goal.
[02:31:54.890 --> 02:31:56.970]  That information on how to use bike lanes.
[02:31:56.970 --> 02:32:01.730]  In these meetings are broadcast free to the public
[02:32:01.730 --> 02:32:04.330]  on like channel 16 or 17 here locally.
[02:32:04.330 --> 02:32:06.370]  And so he's trying to show the city
[02:32:06.370 --> 02:32:07.930]  how to use these new bike lanes.
[02:32:07.930 --> 02:32:10.850]  And this is just, he found out a free way to get on TV
[02:32:10.850 --> 02:32:14.530]  and give a little educational spiel on bike lanes.
[02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:17.350]  If you guys are against something that's going,
[02:32:17.350 --> 02:32:19.790]  or if you need something that isn't happening to happen,
[02:32:19.790 --> 02:32:22.550]  if you're not getting some good recycling in your city,
[02:32:23.410 --> 02:32:24.370]  go to city council and be like,
[02:32:24.370 --> 02:32:25.670]  hey, we've got a lot of trash.
[02:32:25.670 --> 02:32:27.070]  We should work on some recycling.
[02:32:27.070 --> 02:32:28.750]  If that's your path, do whatever your passion is.
[02:32:28.750 --> 02:32:30.130]  Our passion is cannabis.
[02:32:30.130 --> 02:32:31.190]  So we're going to city council
[02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:32.510]  and we're saying cannabis a lot.
[02:32:32.510 --> 02:32:34.070]  There's a young woman who comes down
[02:32:34.070 --> 02:32:36.470]  and speaks on roadside memorials all the time.
[02:32:36.470 --> 02:32:40.710]  And I mean, half the room's in tears every time she speaks.
[02:32:40.710 --> 02:32:41.590]  I'll give you 30 seconds.
[02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:44.390]  Are you for or against roadside
[02:32:45.250 --> 02:32:46.090]  memorials?
[02:32:46.090 --> 02:32:46.910]  I honestly don't care.
[02:32:46.910 --> 02:32:47.750]  You don't care.
[02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:49.250]  Well, that was a quick 30 seconds, Adam.
[02:32:49.250 --> 02:32:50.990]  You know me, I don't care.
[02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:53.690]  Are they trash or are they?
[02:32:53.690 --> 02:32:54.530]  Oh no, no, no, no.
[02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:56.490]  And I definitely wouldn't walk by and kick one.
[02:32:56.490 --> 02:32:57.810]  You know, I'm not that kind of an asshole,
[02:32:57.810 --> 02:33:00.050]  but to me, it's something that,
[02:33:01.610 --> 02:33:03.510]  to me, no one's been lost.
[02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:06.730]  So it's hard for me to really yearn for that.
[02:33:06.730 --> 02:33:08.290]  Every culture has a way they mourn.
[02:33:08.290 --> 02:33:10.170]  And just because I don't understand it
[02:33:10.170 --> 02:33:11.010]  doesn't mean they shouldn't do it.
[02:33:11.010 --> 02:33:13.730]  Pueblo freaking loves the roadside vigil.
[02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:15.390]  It's kind of intense.
[02:33:15.390 --> 02:33:17.630]  And I don't know, driving around
[02:33:17.630 --> 02:33:19.270]  and not being used to roadside memorials,
[02:33:19.270 --> 02:33:21.390]  because it's not something you see all the time in Denver,
[02:33:21.390 --> 02:33:23.390]  even though people have died on every street corner
[02:33:23.390 --> 02:33:24.990]  in Denver too.
[02:33:24.990 --> 02:33:26.990]  Somebody's probably dying on a street corner in Denver
[02:33:26.990 --> 02:33:27.830]  while we're talking about this.
[02:33:27.830 --> 02:33:28.650]  Probably several people.
[02:33:28.650 --> 02:33:29.590]  All right, we're going to shift some gears.
[02:33:29.590 --> 02:33:30.950]  Hold on, I have one more thing to say.
[02:33:30.950 --> 02:33:31.790]  Do it, do it.
[02:33:31.790 --> 02:33:33.550]  Mike, thanks for bringing news to the table, by the way.
[02:33:33.550 --> 02:33:34.390]  Thanks, Mike.
[02:33:34.390 --> 02:33:35.590]  This will have some intelligent news coming up.
[02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:36.790]  That's my whole notes.
[02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:38.630]  So don't look to me for more info.
[02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:41.110]  I've got news too on the internet though.
[02:33:41.110 --> 02:33:44.490]  Locally, don't expect to vote for our president
[02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:46.130]  and he's going to change cannabis laws.
[02:33:46.130 --> 02:33:46.970]  He's not going to do it.
[02:33:46.970 --> 02:33:48.290]  That's where I was going to go with this.
[02:33:48.290 --> 02:33:53.290]  Your city council has to be cannabis, pro cannabis.
[02:33:54.890 --> 02:33:58.330]  And then you work from your city council to your mayor
[02:33:58.330 --> 02:34:00.610]  and you try to get that dude in office.
[02:34:00.610 --> 02:34:02.090]  That's the way Colorado did it.
[02:34:02.090 --> 02:34:05.050]  It didn't start, it started in Denver
[02:34:05.050 --> 02:34:08.010]  and they decriminalized it and it worked outwards.
[02:34:08.010 --> 02:34:10.810]  I mean, this is just what I know from looking outside.
[02:34:11.510 --> 02:34:14.150]  With anything political, you definitely start local.
[02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:16.470]  That's where you generate your base and your support.
[02:34:16.470 --> 02:34:17.590]  And that's what they're talking about
[02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:19.750]  when they say grassroots political effort
[02:34:19.750 --> 02:34:21.110]  is going door to door and saying,
[02:34:21.110 --> 02:34:23.310]  hey stranger, what do you think about cannabis laws
[02:34:23.310 --> 02:34:24.790]  or whatever you're passionate about?
[02:34:24.790 --> 02:34:26.230]  And there's tons of that here.
[02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:28.030]  I mean, a lot of people on a national level,
[02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:29.790]  they think of Colorado and they think
[02:34:29.790 --> 02:34:32.790]  they've legalized medical marijuana years and years ago.
[02:34:32.790 --> 02:34:34.910]  They legalized recreational marijuana.
[02:34:34.910 --> 02:34:37.470]  The game's over, it's done, they won.
[02:34:38.250 --> 02:34:41.570]  It, in a very real sense, yes.
[02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:44.650]  I was in line on January 1st with Jeff and other people
[02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:46.090]  and there was a dance people were doing
[02:34:46.090 --> 02:34:48.050]  on the way out of the store that they just couldn't help.
[02:34:48.050 --> 02:34:48.890]  I did.
[02:34:48.890 --> 02:34:51.210]  No one struts and dances and shimmies
[02:34:51.210 --> 02:34:53.450]  through a parking lot on their way out of Safeway.
[02:34:53.450 --> 02:34:55.410]  I used to sell medical cannabis.
[02:34:55.410 --> 02:34:56.690]  I remember the shuffle.
[02:34:56.690 --> 02:34:59.770]  Mike and I had, Mike was for a few brief days
[02:34:59.770 --> 02:35:02.250]  before we got closed down, Mike worked with me.
[02:35:02.250 --> 02:35:05.770]  I was Mike's boss at the only medical marijuana center
[02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:06.610]  in town.
[02:35:06.610 --> 02:35:09.430]  I sold medical cannabis over the counter for months
[02:35:09.430 --> 02:35:11.310]  and am well known for that around here.
[02:35:11.310 --> 02:35:14.350]  The first time or bliss is just something so fun to watch.
[02:35:14.350 --> 02:35:16.990]  Yeah, I walked out of that dispensary in January 1st
[02:35:16.990 --> 02:35:19.870]  after I was the first person to buy recreational cannabis
[02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:22.670]  at the Greener Side Dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:35:22.670 --> 02:35:24.630]  When I walked out, I've said that so many times.
[02:35:24.630 --> 02:35:26.190]  When I walked out of that dispensary, I was like,
[02:35:26.190 --> 02:35:27.910]  there was a camera guy there and he goes,
[02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:29.270]  hey man, we're doing a documentary.
[02:35:29.270 --> 02:35:31.190]  Can you tell us some, can you say something good
[02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:32.030]  when you walk out?
[02:35:32.030 --> 02:35:32.850]  And I was like, cool, watch this.
[02:35:32.850 --> 02:35:35.070]  And I went right back in the door and I came back out
[02:35:35.130 --> 02:35:37.130]  and I threw my arms up in the air and I yelled just that.
[02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:39.450]  I go, my name is Rasta Jeff and I was the first person
[02:35:39.450 --> 02:35:42.050]  to buy recreational cannabis at the Greener Side Dispensary
[02:35:42.050 --> 02:35:43.090]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:35:43.090 --> 02:35:44.650]  And then I screamed, wow.
[02:35:46.170 --> 02:35:49.090]  And that guy looked at me like that was fucking amazing.
[02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:51.730]  Like that was exactly what he needed for his film.
[02:35:51.730 --> 02:35:54.850]  So that could be found probably somewhere on the internet.
[02:35:54.850 --> 02:35:58.330]  Filmed stuff that they're gonna use every couple of weeks
[02:35:58.330 --> 02:36:00.450]  for the next hundred years that day.
[02:36:00.450 --> 02:36:02.130]  It's hilarious.
[02:36:02.130 --> 02:36:04.690]  All right, I just pulled up, you were talking, reading news.
[02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:08.750]  So what I was leading at is once Colorado legalized
[02:36:08.750 --> 02:36:11.750]  marijuana, the fight quickly became cities and counties
[02:36:11.750 --> 02:36:13.990]  looking for fun ways to ban it again.
[02:36:13.990 --> 02:36:18.350]  So yeah, in a very real way we won, but in a very real way
[02:36:18.350 --> 02:36:22.430]  now we're making the rules and drafting the path forward.
[02:36:22.430 --> 02:36:25.990]  And the whole world's watching Colorado and Pueblo
[02:36:25.990 --> 02:36:28.190]  reports our tax numbers first.
[02:36:28.190 --> 02:36:31.350]  So in a very real way, our tiny little town.
[02:36:31.350 --> 02:36:34.630]  And would you say we get a lot of Texas traffic
[02:36:35.470 --> 02:36:37.090]  because we're like the first stop?
[02:36:37.090 --> 02:36:39.850]  We get a lot of every kind of traffic.
[02:36:39.850 --> 02:36:41.890]  Pueblo's on the way to the rest of the US
[02:36:41.890 --> 02:36:44.030]  from every place South of here.
[02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:46.290]  This used to be a stop on the Santa Fe trail.
[02:36:46.290 --> 02:36:47.130]  I didn't know that.
[02:36:47.130 --> 02:36:47.950]  Major stop.
[02:36:47.950 --> 02:36:49.930]  People have been stopping and getting supplies or gas here
[02:36:49.930 --> 02:36:52.930]  for a lot longer than any of us have been alive.
[02:36:52.930 --> 02:36:53.770]  Come on.
[02:36:53.770 --> 02:36:54.850]  Very true, dad.
[02:36:54.850 --> 02:36:56.130]  Very true, dad.
[02:36:56.130 --> 02:36:56.970]  Awesome.
[02:36:56.970 --> 02:36:58.090]  All right, we're gonna, let's do a,
[02:36:58.090 --> 02:36:59.410]  do you guys feel, how much time we got?
[02:36:59.410 --> 02:37:00.250]  One thing.
[02:37:00.250 --> 02:37:01.170]  We've only got a couple of things.
[02:37:01.170 --> 02:37:02.690]  I'm gonna see how long we've been into this.
[02:37:02.690 --> 02:37:04.290]  We're 35 minutes in.
[02:37:04.950 --> 02:37:05.790]  Holy crap.
[02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:07.350]  Let me read a news article.
[02:37:07.350 --> 02:37:09.510]  Let me read a news article.
[02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:10.990]  Mike's always bringing the good news,
[02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:12.570]  but I just read news from the cannabis.
[02:37:12.570 --> 02:37:14.230]  This one's by Ricardo Baca.
[02:37:14.230 --> 02:37:15.390]  This one's kind of a neat article.
[02:37:15.390 --> 02:37:19.630]  This shows, to me, this shows that things are evolving
[02:37:19.630 --> 02:37:23.630]  and that America is starting to make changes.
[02:37:23.630 --> 02:37:24.750]  That's what I got from it.
[02:37:24.750 --> 02:37:26.830]  So it's positive changes.
[02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:29.470]  It says marijuana activists are already planning
[02:37:29.470 --> 02:37:32.590]  the 2016 campaign to regulate and legalize the sale
[02:37:32.610 --> 02:37:35.690]  for recreational pot in Nevada, home to Las Vegas,
[02:37:35.690 --> 02:37:39.010]  one of the world's biggest tourism destinations.
[02:37:39.010 --> 02:37:40.890]  But some tourists won't have to wait that long
[02:37:40.890 --> 02:37:42.650]  to legally buy weed in Las Vegas,
[02:37:42.650 --> 02:37:46.850]  thanks to the most legal reciprocity law in the US.
[02:37:46.850 --> 02:37:47.690]  I nailed that word, huh?
[02:37:47.690 --> 02:37:48.810]  You almost.
[02:37:48.810 --> 02:37:49.650]  No?
[02:37:49.650 --> 02:37:50.470]  You're so close.
[02:37:50.470 --> 02:37:51.310]  Reciprocity.
[02:37:51.310 --> 02:37:52.150]  You're way close.
[02:37:52.150 --> 02:37:52.970]  We practiced this beforehand.
[02:37:52.970 --> 02:37:53.810]  It's a tricky word.
[02:37:53.810 --> 02:37:54.650]  God damn it.
[02:37:54.650 --> 02:37:55.570]  Words are hard.
[02:37:55.570 --> 02:37:56.690]  I need another day.
[02:37:56.690 --> 02:37:59.330]  I didn't know what it was, so I had to define it.
[02:37:59.330 --> 02:38:00.490]  I just didn't know how to say it.
[02:38:00.490 --> 02:38:01.490]  I could read it like a champ.
[02:38:02.270 --> 02:38:03.110]  My tongue is mad at that word.
[02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:04.510]  It's reciprocity, homie.
[02:38:04.510 --> 02:38:06.030]  All right, well, Mike just said it for me,
[02:38:06.030 --> 02:38:07.310]  so I'm just gonna point at Mike,
[02:38:07.310 --> 02:38:09.430]  and he'll say that word every time it comes up from now on.
[02:38:09.430 --> 02:38:10.270]  Awesome.
[02:38:10.270 --> 02:38:12.130]  Medical marijuana card holders throughout the US
[02:38:12.130 --> 02:38:15.990]  will be able to purchase pot in Nevada starting in 2015.
[02:38:16.950 --> 02:38:18.030]  All they'll have to do is show
[02:38:18.030 --> 02:38:19.550]  their medical marijuana license,
[02:38:19.550 --> 02:38:22.050]  show a government ID proving they're 21 or older,
[02:38:22.050 --> 02:38:25.070]  and sign an affidavit, and they'll have access to that shop,
[02:38:25.070 --> 02:38:27.630]  but no others for their stay in Nevada.
[02:38:27.630 --> 02:38:30.230]  Does that lead me to believe they only get one stop
[02:38:30.230 --> 02:38:31.190]  when they go to Nevada?
[02:38:31.410 --> 02:38:34.450]  That sounds like you gotta pick it and stick it, homie.
[02:38:34.450 --> 02:38:36.290]  Pick one and stay with it.
[02:38:36.290 --> 02:38:37.890]  But how much are you allowed to?
[02:38:38.890 --> 02:38:39.730]  Let me read further. Interesting,
[02:38:39.730 --> 02:38:41.250]  so they're trying to prevent smurfing.
[02:38:41.250 --> 02:38:43.370]  That's an odd way to do that, but okay.
[02:38:43.370 --> 02:38:44.770]  There you go.
[02:38:44.770 --> 02:38:48.730]  Will this liberal medical reciprocity?
[02:38:48.730 --> 02:38:50.890]  I was wondering what the point was gonna look like.
[02:38:50.890 --> 02:38:54.690]  Yeah, I just came across the word reciprocity act
[02:38:54.690 --> 02:38:58.650]  as a soft lead to recreational measures in Nevada,
[02:38:58.670 --> 02:39:01.190]  and will Nevada pass full-on recreational legalization
[02:39:01.190 --> 02:39:02.670]  in 2016?
[02:39:02.670 --> 02:39:05.350]  Of course it will, said Jim Lamoureux,
[02:39:05.350 --> 02:39:06.750]  who handles government relations
[02:39:06.750 --> 02:39:09.270]  at Colorado-based pot testing facility Cannlabs,
[02:39:09.270 --> 02:39:11.150]  which recently announced its future present
[02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:13.470]  in Nevada's marijuana market.
[02:39:13.470 --> 02:39:15.850]  Most people are factoring into their models.
[02:39:16.970 --> 02:39:18.550]  Oh, he must not be able to say the word either
[02:39:18.550 --> 02:39:19.950]  because he skipped it in his sentence
[02:39:19.950 --> 02:39:21.870]  and they put it in there in parentheses.
[02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:23.470]  That's nice, he can't say the word either.
[02:39:23.470 --> 02:39:24.310]  Nice, we're in the same boat.
[02:39:24.310 --> 02:39:26.070]  It's a tricky one, no, you're not alone there, buddy.
[02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:27.630]  All the applications that went in,
[02:39:27.630 --> 02:39:30.210]  people discussed it as part of their model.
[02:39:30.210 --> 02:39:31.770]  You can consider that Nevada has fewer
[02:39:31.770 --> 02:39:33.810]  than 7,000 medical marijuana patients.
[02:39:33.810 --> 02:39:35.330]  It's not a very large base,
[02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:37.730]  but when you factor in MMJ patients from other states
[02:39:37.730 --> 02:39:39.970]  who might take advantage of Nevada's system,
[02:39:39.970 --> 02:39:44.970]  another 110,000 from Colorado, 570,000 from California,
[02:39:45.490 --> 02:39:47.170]  and 100,000 from Washington,
[02:39:47.170 --> 02:39:50.410]  suddenly those numbers are looking a lot better.
[02:39:50.410 --> 02:39:51.410]  Given, yeah.
[02:39:51.410 --> 02:39:54.010]  Not to mention if Missouri goes legal this year,
[02:39:54.010 --> 02:39:55.730]  which they're talking about 2016.
[02:39:55.730 --> 02:39:56.570]  Michigan.
[02:39:56.570 --> 02:39:59.110]  A couple other medical marijuana states.
[02:39:59.110 --> 02:40:02.030]  California is gonna be trying to do legalization
[02:40:02.030 --> 02:40:02.870]  this year as well.
[02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:03.870]  What happened, Florida?
[02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:05.310]  Florida.
[02:40:05.310 --> 02:40:07.910]  58% is a pretty good number.
[02:40:07.910 --> 02:40:10.270]  Did we or did we not?
[02:40:10.270 --> 02:40:12.310]  No, it sucks for those people that are sick
[02:40:12.310 --> 02:40:13.150]  and they need it.
[02:40:13.150 --> 02:40:15.750]  But did we or did we not talk about this?
[02:40:15.750 --> 02:40:18.510]  Like you thought it, I don't trust Florida's government
[02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:20.310]  to like give them, say, oh, okay,
[02:40:20.310 --> 02:40:24.310]  here's a full medical bill, you can't do anything with it.
[02:40:24.310 --> 02:40:26.150]  Nothing can come in, nothing can go out.
[02:40:26.650 --> 02:40:29.010]  That's gotta be all CBD here in Florida
[02:40:29.010 --> 02:40:31.090]  because we just got such banging medicine
[02:40:31.090 --> 02:40:32.370]  like New Jersey does.
[02:40:34.410 --> 02:40:37.170]  I mean, you were part of that kind of argument
[02:40:37.170 --> 02:40:40.210]  at the beginning and I stuck with it, dude.
[02:40:40.210 --> 02:40:42.290]  And I'm sorry, man.
[02:40:42.290 --> 02:40:43.130]  I still-
[02:40:43.130 --> 02:40:44.330]  Florida's having all kinds of issues.
[02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:46.170]  They had CBD only legislation
[02:40:46.170 --> 02:40:48.250]  before this recent medical marijuana failure.
[02:40:48.250 --> 02:40:50.490]  And right after the medical marijuana amendment failed,
[02:40:50.490 --> 02:40:52.850]  the judge tossed their CBD rules.
[02:40:52.850 --> 02:40:55.170]  So they're back to square fucked.
[02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:56.070]  Sorry, kids.
[02:40:57.150 --> 02:40:58.310]  All right, so this article says,
[02:40:58.310 --> 02:40:59.390]  giving patients the ability
[02:40:59.390 --> 02:41:02.090]  to legally access medical marijuana
[02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:04.430]  when they're visiting a legal medical marijuana state
[02:41:04.430 --> 02:41:06.110]  just makes sense, said Taylor West,
[02:41:06.110 --> 02:41:09.350]  deputy director of the National Cannabis Industry Association
[02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:12.190]  and National Trade Group for Legal Marijuana Businesses.
[02:41:12.190 --> 02:41:13.210]  And it makes even more sense
[02:41:13.210 --> 02:41:14.550]  when you're talking about a state
[02:41:14.550 --> 02:41:17.630]  that has such a huge number of out-of-state visitors.
[02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:19.550]  It's safer for patients
[02:41:19.550 --> 02:41:22.510]  and good for Nevada businesses, win-win.
[02:41:23.490 --> 02:41:26.410]  That would almost be like Florida.
[02:41:26.410 --> 02:41:28.530]  Like if you went medical
[02:41:28.530 --> 02:41:31.330]  and would allow other states to come in.
[02:41:31.330 --> 02:41:33.830]  That dispensary right by Disney World would crush.
[02:41:35.050 --> 02:41:36.430]  I mean, that's been the two downsides
[02:41:36.430 --> 02:41:38.130]  to medical marijuana from the beginning
[02:41:38.130 --> 02:41:41.930]  is it's technically illegal and you can't travel.
[02:41:41.930 --> 02:41:43.410]  I mean, if you're good in Colorado,
[02:41:43.410 --> 02:41:44.490]  you're not good anywhere else.
[02:41:44.490 --> 02:41:45.450]  If you're good in Washington,
[02:41:45.450 --> 02:41:46.890]  you're not good anywhere else.
[02:41:46.890 --> 02:41:47.730]  Yeah, it's good.
[02:41:47.730 --> 02:41:48.930]  And now there's some reciprocity
[02:41:48.930 --> 02:41:49.810]  and that's a beautiful thing.
[02:41:49.810 --> 02:41:51.250]  You'll see me in Vegas now.
[02:41:51.270 --> 02:41:53.270]  And I mean, now look at all the events.
[02:41:55.270 --> 02:41:57.670]  Secret Cops is gonna be way bigger in 2015.
[02:41:57.670 --> 02:41:59.550]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:41:59.550 --> 02:42:02.190]  No, 500 tickets max.
[02:42:02.190 --> 02:42:03.870]  Keep it small, nice and private.
[02:42:03.870 --> 02:42:05.990]  I agree with that sentiment,
[02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:09.030]  but I'd be impressed if they keep it to 500 tickets.
[02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:09.990]  Yeah, it's hard to.
[02:42:09.990 --> 02:42:10.910]  All right, so check this out.
[02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:11.870]  The article goes on and says,
[02:42:11.870 --> 02:42:13.070]  "'Sure enough, Vegas sees roughly
[02:42:13.070 --> 02:42:14.750]  40 million visitors annually.'"
[02:42:14.750 --> 02:42:15.870]  That's a lot of people.
[02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:16.910]  "'But how many of those tourists
[02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:18.670]  will have valid medical marijuana cards
[02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:19.650]  and how many of those patients
[02:42:19.670 --> 02:42:22.270]  will take the time to seek legal Nevada weed?'
[02:42:22.270 --> 02:42:25.470]  "'We're still talking relatively small numbers,'
[02:42:25.470 --> 02:42:27.310]  said Joe Hodes, chief marketing officer
[02:42:27.310 --> 02:42:28.850]  at Denver-based marijuana company,
[02:42:28.850 --> 02:42:32.750]  Eddie, sorry, I read that way too quickly, Dixie Elixirs.
[02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:36.070]  It's not as if the average tourist or consumer
[02:42:36.070 --> 02:42:37.710]  can show up and make a purchase.
[02:42:37.710 --> 02:42:38.990]  The Red Card Act won't have,'
[02:42:38.990 --> 02:42:39.830]  hey, that's what they're calling it,
[02:42:39.830 --> 02:42:42.310]  won't have a huge impact on their tourism
[02:42:42.310 --> 02:42:43.750]  because it's a small number of people,
[02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:46.590]  many of whom were probably already going to Vegas.
[02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:47.830]  It might be a convenience,
[02:42:47.830 --> 02:42:48.950]  but if I have a red card,
[02:42:48.970 --> 02:42:52.090]  I can already get my medicine in my own state
[02:42:52.090 --> 02:42:54.010]  and flying with it can be sketchy sometimes.
[02:42:54.010 --> 02:42:55.610]  Yeah, you can get it in your own state,
[02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:57.450]  you just can't take it with you to Vegas
[02:42:57.450 --> 02:42:58.970]  because you've got to fly there
[02:42:58.970 --> 02:43:01.930]  or drive through Utah or New Mexico to get there.
[02:43:01.930 --> 02:43:03.170]  Well, now it sounds like you're legit.
[02:43:03.170 --> 02:43:04.010]  So when you get there, you get it.
[02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:08.170]  Because what happens when it becomes under pressure?
[02:43:08.170 --> 02:43:09.370]  It like explodes or something?
[02:43:09.370 --> 02:43:10.210]  No, no, you're cool.
[02:43:10.210 --> 02:43:12.090]  I won't go to Utah with friends with a lot of weed.
[02:43:12.090 --> 02:43:14.170]  Is this the TSA telling us no?
[02:43:14.170 --> 02:43:15.010]  Yeah.
[02:43:15.010 --> 02:43:15.830]  Oh, okay.
[02:43:15.830 --> 02:43:17.050]  So everybody else can change their policies
[02:43:17.110 --> 02:43:19.190]  except for the people that transport everybody, right?
[02:43:19.190 --> 02:43:20.030]  Pretty much.
[02:43:20.030 --> 02:43:20.850]  Oh, okay.
[02:43:20.850 --> 02:43:21.690]  All right, so it says,
[02:43:21.690 --> 02:43:23.070]  if Nevada does pass recreational marijuana measures
[02:43:23.070 --> 02:43:27.190]  in the 2016 election,
[02:43:27.190 --> 02:43:29.550]  the earliest the state will see those sales starting
[02:43:29.550 --> 02:43:33.270]  is late 2017, but 2018 is more likely.
[02:43:33.270 --> 02:43:35.190]  Until then, companies such as Dixie,
[02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:36.550]  which hopes to soon have an agreement
[02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:39.590]  allowing the sale of its cannabis-infused edibles,
[02:43:39.590 --> 02:43:41.390]  drinks, and topicals in Nevada
[02:43:41.390 --> 02:43:45.070]  will have time to leave their mark on the Las Vegas Strip.
[02:43:45.070 --> 02:43:46.590]  I was going to ask why two years,
[02:43:47.090 --> 02:43:50.890]  but after seeing what just happened in Washington,
[02:43:50.890 --> 02:43:53.370]  where they're so unprepared for recreational,
[02:43:53.370 --> 02:43:56.050]  I would almost expect two years to be right about right.
[02:43:56.050 --> 02:43:57.690]  Yeah, give them time to grow some herb,
[02:43:57.690 --> 02:43:58.730]  get the rules in place,
[02:43:58.730 --> 02:44:00.050]  the guild of dispensary.
[02:44:00.050 --> 02:44:02.730]  Get a couple things in stock and like cure it.
[02:44:02.730 --> 02:44:03.970]  And it'd be in-
[02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:05.210]  This rule makes process-
[02:44:05.210 --> 02:44:06.050]  That's a funny joke.
[02:44:06.050 --> 02:44:08.650]  You think the dispensary's gonna cure some weed?
[02:44:08.650 --> 02:44:09.650]  You're a funny guy.
[02:44:09.650 --> 02:44:10.490]  Har, har, har.
[02:44:10.490 --> 02:44:12.050]  Har, har, harvested.
[02:44:12.050 --> 02:44:12.970]  Durka, durka.
[02:44:12.970 --> 02:44:13.810]  All right.
[02:44:13.810 --> 02:44:14.630]  Durka, durka.
[02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:16.050]  So we didn't review either the film we watched-
[02:44:16.270 --> 02:44:18.270]  That's where we're headed right now.
[02:44:18.270 --> 02:44:19.270]  The next thing is,
[02:44:19.270 --> 02:44:20.550]  so guys, we bragged about,
[02:44:20.550 --> 02:44:22.270]  Adam and I bragged recently,
[02:44:22.270 --> 02:44:23.190]  about a couple months ago,
[02:44:23.190 --> 02:44:24.470]  about going to see Joe Rogan.
[02:44:24.470 --> 02:44:25.670]  I ain't shut up about it.
[02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:26.510]  So.
[02:44:26.510 --> 02:44:28.310]  Now that I've seen the special,
[02:44:28.310 --> 02:44:29.930]  I can see why you didn't shut up about it.
[02:44:29.930 --> 02:44:30.770]  I wish I was there.
[02:44:30.770 --> 02:44:31.610]  Yeah, we saw Joe,
[02:44:31.610 --> 02:44:34.550]  Angela, myself, and Adam went and saw Joe Rogan live
[02:44:34.550 --> 02:44:35.670]  at the Denver Comedy Works
[02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:38.750]  during the taping of his new special that aired last night.
[02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:40.010]  And I DVR'd it.
[02:44:40.010 --> 02:44:42.670]  Mike came over here and watched it with Angela and I.
[02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:45.150]  Adam watched it at his place with his kind lady.
[02:44:46.310 --> 02:44:49.030]  That was a funny damn comedy special.
[02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:50.230]  They cut out a lot.
[02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:51.070]  We were there.
[02:44:51.070 --> 02:44:52.350]  They cut out a lot.
[02:44:52.350 --> 02:44:53.190]  Whoa, yeah.
[02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:54.030]  That's what you guys were saying last night.
[02:44:54.030 --> 02:44:56.950]  I liked the final product they put together.
[02:44:56.950 --> 02:44:58.030]  It was really,
[02:44:58.030 --> 02:45:01.350]  I wish I had that quality of a video camera.
[02:45:01.350 --> 02:45:03.150]  The cameras were tiny.
[02:45:03.150 --> 02:45:04.790]  The camera that Rogan is staring into
[02:45:04.790 --> 02:45:05.830]  the majority of the time,
[02:45:05.830 --> 02:45:06.950]  I'm sitting under,
[02:45:06.950 --> 02:45:08.110]  like a lot of the time.
[02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:09.430]  It's a small little thing,
[02:45:09.430 --> 02:45:13.790]  like a LED screen display, basically,
[02:45:13.790 --> 02:45:14.630]  and that's it.
[02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:15.450]  Nice.
[02:45:15.790 --> 02:45:16.630]  It's cool.
[02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:17.950]  It was a great comedy show.
[02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:20.230]  He crushed it from beginning to end.
[02:45:20.230 --> 02:45:21.070]  My first.
[02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:22.310]  Yeah, I was laughing hard last night.
[02:45:22.310 --> 02:45:23.990]  Professional one, I would say.
[02:45:23.990 --> 02:45:27.110]  You know, and that was a good one to go to, for sure.
[02:45:28.910 --> 02:45:30.590]  You hadn't gone to another show at Comedy Works
[02:45:30.590 --> 02:45:31.430]  before that with us?
[02:45:31.430 --> 02:45:32.630]  I've never been to a professional comedy show
[02:45:32.630 --> 02:45:36.350]  like somebody TV-wise, like big time.
[02:45:36.350 --> 02:45:37.470]  I mean, I've done stuff here,
[02:45:37.470 --> 02:45:39.030]  and I mean, it's basically the same,
[02:45:39.030 --> 02:45:40.990]  but there was a lot more rules to that.
[02:45:40.990 --> 02:45:41.830]  I mean, that was a comedy special.
[02:45:41.830 --> 02:45:43.230]  Oh, the taping was intense.
[02:45:43.230 --> 02:45:44.070]  Yeah, that was.
[02:45:44.290 --> 02:45:45.690]  There were so many crowd rules.
[02:45:45.690 --> 02:45:46.890]  They were moving the crowd around
[02:45:46.890 --> 02:45:48.210]  and putting ugly people in the back
[02:45:48.210 --> 02:45:49.290]  and sexy people up front,
[02:45:49.290 --> 02:45:50.490]  and of course, we were under camera,
[02:45:50.490 --> 02:45:51.690]  so you couldn't even see us.
[02:45:51.690 --> 02:45:52.530]  It was sort of pointless.
[02:45:52.530 --> 02:45:54.410]  I never saw a real good look at anybody.
[02:45:54.410 --> 02:45:55.810]  That's where I was headed with this.
[02:45:55.810 --> 02:45:56.810]  It was really dark.
[02:45:56.810 --> 02:45:59.170]  The only lights in the building were on the stage,
[02:45:59.170 --> 02:46:00.230]  and you couldn't even see the crowd,
[02:46:00.230 --> 02:46:02.010]  so all the moving around and all the rules
[02:46:02.010 --> 02:46:03.690]  and the no hats and no logo shit
[02:46:03.690 --> 02:46:05.410]  was just too much tension.
[02:46:05.410 --> 02:46:07.650]  Or it might've applied if he had a 20-minute bit
[02:46:07.650 --> 02:46:09.810]  on picking on people in the front row or some shit,
[02:46:09.810 --> 02:46:13.250]  but all I saw was the profile of one kid
[02:46:13.270 --> 02:46:14.110]  a couple of times,
[02:46:14.110 --> 02:46:15.790]  and that's pretty much all the crowd you see.
[02:46:15.790 --> 02:46:17.830]  And that's where we were for Doug Benson.
[02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:18.670]  Yeah.
[02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:19.490]  That's what I kept telling him.
[02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:21.190]  Yeah, there's three seats off to the side up on the top,
[02:46:21.190 --> 02:46:22.030]  and that's where.
[02:46:22.030 --> 02:46:22.850]  Nice.
[02:46:22.850 --> 02:46:23.690]  Yeah.
[02:46:23.690 --> 02:46:24.550]  And see, right next to Jeff,
[02:46:24.550 --> 02:46:26.670]  Jeff was basically underneath the camera.
[02:46:26.670 --> 02:46:28.230]  There was a guy sitting next to us,
[02:46:28.230 --> 02:46:31.550]  but it was still wheelchair accessible,
[02:46:31.550 --> 02:46:33.630]  so it wasn't sloped.
[02:46:33.630 --> 02:46:34.750]  So he was up higher,
[02:46:34.750 --> 02:46:36.750]  so every shot from across the way
[02:46:36.750 --> 02:46:39.110]  it basically blocked us completely out of there
[02:46:39.110 --> 02:46:42.670]  because we were underneath his shoulders, basically,
[02:46:42.770 --> 02:46:44.490]  probably down to his elbow.
[02:46:44.490 --> 02:46:45.330]  Yeah, I know.
[02:46:45.330 --> 02:46:46.610]  There's a way easier way to get on TV.
[02:46:46.610 --> 02:46:47.570]  Just go to city council.
[02:46:47.570 --> 02:46:51.130]  They give you five minutes to talk live on television.
[02:46:51.130 --> 02:46:54.130]  Joe Rogan doesn't have to catch you in the side view, y'all.
[02:46:54.130 --> 02:46:54.950]  That's funny.
[02:46:54.950 --> 02:46:55.790]  That's my little piece.
[02:46:55.790 --> 02:46:56.630]  Great show.
[02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:57.450]  Great show.
[02:46:57.450 --> 02:46:58.290]  Go be on TV for free.
[02:46:58.290 --> 02:47:00.070]  All right, so speaking of Joe Rogan being on a video,
[02:47:00.070 --> 02:47:00.910]  shout out to Joe Rogan.
[02:47:00.910 --> 02:47:01.730]  That show was great.
[02:47:01.730 --> 02:47:02.570]  Shout out to Comedy Works.
[02:47:02.570 --> 02:47:04.810]  Big respect to Melissa.
[02:47:04.810 --> 02:47:06.210]  If you guys don't know Melissa at Comedy Works,
[02:47:06.210 --> 02:47:08.110]  then you don't know what you're missing.
[02:47:09.250 --> 02:47:11.050]  Let's see, what else am I gonna say?
[02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:13.470]  We watched a culture high tonight.
[02:47:13.470 --> 02:47:15.070]  I invited these dudes over.
[02:47:15.070 --> 02:47:16.910]  I rented it from iTunes,
[02:47:16.910 --> 02:47:18.910]  which I've never rented anything from iTunes.
[02:47:18.910 --> 02:47:21.110]  It feels kind of weird to pay 4.99
[02:47:21.110 --> 02:47:24.390]  to watch something for 24 hours on my computer,
[02:47:24.390 --> 02:47:25.510]  but okay, I get it.
[02:47:25.510 --> 02:47:26.630]  I'm glad we did it.
[02:47:26.630 --> 02:47:28.550]  Me too, it was worth my 4.99.
[02:47:30.470 --> 02:47:31.390]  I learned a lot of stuff.
[02:47:31.390 --> 02:47:32.750]  I tried to take some notes.
[02:47:33.590 --> 02:47:35.870]  We came to a really easy conclusion.
[02:47:35.870 --> 02:47:37.350]  Fuck Nancy Grace.
[02:47:37.350 --> 02:47:38.430]  Fuck Nancy Grace.
[02:47:38.430 --> 02:47:40.030]  I can't believe I haven't said that yet.
[02:47:40.050 --> 02:47:42.250]  That's the only fucking thing I wrote down.
[02:47:42.250 --> 02:47:43.090]  That's it.
[02:47:43.090 --> 02:47:44.930]  I fucking failed.
[02:47:44.930 --> 02:47:46.490]  Yeah, you fucking.
[02:47:46.490 --> 02:47:47.930]  Well, I thought, I'm sorry.
[02:47:47.930 --> 02:47:49.850]  You want me to hit pause?
[02:47:49.850 --> 02:47:51.290]  No, no, no, no.
[02:47:51.290 --> 02:47:53.170]  You might just have to bleep out a name, that's all.
[02:47:53.170 --> 02:47:54.010]  Go ahead.
[02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:59.090]  Do you want to say it with me?
[02:47:59.090 --> 02:48:02.490]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:48:02.490 --> 02:48:04.330]  It deserves to be said as a group.
[02:48:04.330 --> 02:48:06.050]  I'm sorry, but anyway, fuck Nancy Grace.
[02:48:06.050 --> 02:48:07.170]  Yeah, fuck Nancy Grace.
[02:48:07.170 --> 02:48:09.650]  Everyone should check out the culture high.
[02:48:10.590 --> 02:48:12.910]  Sit your parents down, have them watch it with you.
[02:48:12.910 --> 02:48:15.870]  Watch it as a family, watch it with your friends.
[02:48:15.870 --> 02:48:16.710]  It's worth it.
[02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:17.530]  You'll learn a lot.
[02:48:17.530 --> 02:48:20.430]  Give it to someone that's maybe not open-minded,
[02:48:20.430 --> 02:48:22.250]  but willing to listen.
[02:48:22.250 --> 02:48:24.030]  That's all.
[02:48:24.030 --> 02:48:24.870]  Willing.
[02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:26.870]  Who's one of your favorite speakers in there?
[02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:27.910]  I did write down a name.
[02:48:27.910 --> 02:48:28.750]  I forget him.
[02:48:28.750 --> 02:48:29.790]  He was towards the end.
[02:48:29.790 --> 02:48:31.270]  Howard Bloom, he gets crazy.
[02:48:31.270 --> 02:48:34.070]  He gets all old man-ish and shit.
[02:48:34.070 --> 02:48:36.110]  You know, like his jowl start.
[02:48:36.110 --> 02:48:36.950]  And it's funny.
[02:48:36.950 --> 02:48:37.790]  It is, dude.
[02:48:37.790 --> 02:48:39.390]  But his message is true.
[02:48:40.130 --> 02:48:41.290]  So it's there.
[02:48:41.290 --> 02:48:43.130]  Who's your favorite dude in the show, Mike?
[02:48:43.130 --> 02:48:44.410]  It's a toss up.
[02:48:44.410 --> 02:48:46.970]  I'm a huge fan of Judge James Gray.
[02:48:46.970 --> 02:48:49.010]  I'm a huge fan of Dr. Lester Greenspoon.
[02:48:49.010 --> 02:48:52.430]  And they're both heavy narrators in the beginning.
[02:48:52.430 --> 02:48:55.210]  Ed Burns, the guy that did The Wire is-
[02:48:55.210 --> 02:48:57.050]  Ed Burns is one of my faves.
[02:48:57.050 --> 02:48:58.450]  Is featured in a talking.
[02:48:58.450 --> 02:49:03.450]  Dr. Lester Greenspoon wrote life-changing books on cannabis.
[02:49:03.530 --> 02:49:05.970]  One of the, like the researchers.
[02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:08.170]  I mean, Harvard trained, works at Harvard,
[02:49:08.170 --> 02:49:12.250]  researching cannabis for the last, what, 50 years?
[02:49:12.250 --> 02:49:13.250]  How many?
[02:49:13.250 --> 02:49:15.710]  I mean, just incredible, incredible speakers
[02:49:15.710 --> 02:49:17.310]  to have gathered for this documentary.
[02:49:17.310 --> 02:49:18.350]  I loved it.
[02:49:18.350 --> 02:49:19.510]  I know I keep interrupting.
[02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:20.350]  No, go ahead.
[02:49:20.350 --> 02:49:21.170]  You got a question.
[02:49:21.170 --> 02:49:26.030]  How many years do you think like he worked for,
[02:49:26.030 --> 02:49:29.030]  he's like ex-D-I-D-A.
[02:49:29.030 --> 02:49:29.870]  Which one?
[02:49:29.870 --> 02:49:31.430]  The, you just said-
[02:49:31.430 --> 02:49:32.270]  Ed Burns.
[02:49:32.270 --> 02:49:33.630]  Ed Burns.
[02:49:33.630 --> 02:49:36.630]  He was, I can't remember which law enforcement agency.
[02:49:36.650 --> 02:49:38.610]  He was a cop for a whole bunch of,
[02:49:38.610 --> 02:49:42.050]  he was a murder detective for a whole bunch of years
[02:49:42.050 --> 02:49:43.610]  in Baltimore, I believe.
[02:49:43.610 --> 02:49:44.450]  Yeah.
[02:49:44.450 --> 02:49:45.970]  Those dudes always have some stories, man.
[02:49:45.970 --> 02:49:48.250]  Like every time, like, and it's,
[02:49:48.250 --> 02:49:52.330]  we have more of them that come over to our side
[02:49:52.330 --> 02:49:54.770]  than they, than, you know, like the druggies clean up
[02:49:54.770 --> 02:49:56.330]  and go to the cops because for number one-
[02:49:56.330 --> 02:49:58.690]  Law enforcement against prohibition's an awesome group.
[02:49:58.690 --> 02:50:03.090]  That's full, made up fully of ex-judges, cops, detectives,
[02:50:03.090 --> 02:50:05.930]  D-A agents that just saw that prohibition
[02:50:06.230 --> 02:50:07.990]  doesn't do anything but harm.
[02:50:09.070 --> 02:50:11.230]  And it might come from an interesting place
[02:50:11.230 --> 02:50:12.790]  of trying to prevent drug use,
[02:50:12.790 --> 02:50:14.610]  but it doesn't do that at all.
[02:50:14.610 --> 02:50:18.230]  And on top of not being effective at all at its main goal,
[02:50:18.230 --> 02:50:20.310]  it's also incredibly harmful to the society
[02:50:20.310 --> 02:50:21.710]  it's attempting to try to.
[02:50:22.830 --> 02:50:25.110]  I can, I can agree with that.
[02:50:25.110 --> 02:50:27.310]  I'd also had clips from Joe Rogan.
[02:50:27.310 --> 02:50:28.670]  We saw Snoop Dizzle.
[02:50:28.670 --> 02:50:30.830]  We saw Lester Grinspoon.
[02:50:30.830 --> 02:50:31.830]  Brian Redman was in there.
[02:50:31.830 --> 02:50:33.150]  A lot of people might not know who that is,
[02:50:33.150 --> 02:50:35.510]  but I know who he is and shout out to Brian Redman.
[02:50:35.530 --> 02:50:36.610]  B-Rill was in there.
[02:50:37.490 --> 02:50:38.330]  They also, they proved-
[02:50:38.330 --> 02:50:39.210]  Mr. Nice.
[02:50:39.210 --> 02:50:40.050]  Mr. Nice was in there.
[02:50:40.050 --> 02:50:42.250]  I was gonna say who was your favorite, but I'm-
[02:50:42.250 --> 02:50:43.090]  All of the above.
[02:50:43.090 --> 02:50:44.090]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:50:44.090 --> 02:50:45.250]  I got attachments to all of them
[02:50:45.250 --> 02:50:46.650]  because, you know, just industry things.
[02:50:46.650 --> 02:50:48.570]  I look up to a lot of those people.
[02:50:48.570 --> 02:50:50.170]  They actually show that cannabis, scientifically,
[02:50:50.170 --> 02:50:53.550]  they prove that cannabis does not cause schizophrenia.
[02:50:53.550 --> 02:50:54.390]  They reminded me-
[02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:55.810]  They talk a lot about that research in the beginning.
[02:50:55.810 --> 02:50:57.450]  I loved that lead in.
[02:50:57.450 --> 02:50:59.850]  Cannabis was outlawed in 1937.
[02:50:59.850 --> 02:51:04.010]  And they actually mentioned that alcohol poisoning
[02:51:04.030 --> 02:51:07.990]  causes 250,000 deaths per year.
[02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:09.430]  Did you catch the tobacco numbers?
[02:51:09.430 --> 02:51:10.710]  No. 500,000?
[02:51:10.710 --> 02:51:13.590]  They compare it to the Holocaust every year.
[02:51:13.590 --> 02:51:14.430]  Oh yeah, they did.
[02:51:14.430 --> 02:51:16.030]  Okay, you're right.
[02:51:16.030 --> 02:51:18.110]  A Holocaust around the planet every year
[02:51:18.110 --> 02:51:19.430]  due to tobacco consumption.
[02:51:19.430 --> 02:51:22.230]  Of not just the Jewish people,
[02:51:22.230 --> 02:51:24.590]  but also of the German soldiers that died as well.
[02:51:24.590 --> 02:51:26.310]  I don't remember how they broke it down,
[02:51:26.310 --> 02:51:27.710]  but it's like five and a half million people
[02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:30.230]  around the globe die every year due to tobacco consumption.
[02:51:30.230 --> 02:51:32.110]  And it's just crazy.
[02:51:32.110 --> 02:51:33.510]  Zero from cannabis.
[02:51:34.490 --> 02:51:37.650]  The US is held up as a model around the world
[02:51:37.650 --> 02:51:40.530]  is the place that has pushed tobacco consumption
[02:51:40.530 --> 02:51:44.410]  down to record levels with education.
[02:51:44.410 --> 02:51:48.050]  That's really all we did is we check ID at the point of sale
[02:51:48.050 --> 02:51:52.250]  and we tell every school kid, if you smoke tobacco,
[02:51:52.250 --> 02:51:54.170]  it will lead to these health effects.
[02:51:54.170 --> 02:51:57.450]  And we give them the legitimate information on tobacco.
[02:51:57.450 --> 02:51:59.130]  And that's all we did.
[02:51:59.790 --> 02:52:04.230]  And they made a few catchy kind of teenager commercials.
[02:52:04.230 --> 02:52:06.950]  I mean, they threw a couple of million dollars every year
[02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:09.330]  at like crazy teen smoking ads and stuff.
[02:52:09.330 --> 02:52:11.510]  But like the really effective stuff
[02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:13.310]  is just sitting the kid down in health class
[02:52:13.310 --> 02:52:15.190]  and being like, this is your nice pink lung.
[02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:16.630]  This is the black lung.
[02:52:16.630 --> 02:52:18.030]  I remember those videos.
[02:52:18.030 --> 02:52:18.870]  You know what, my kids.
[02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:19.830]  All right guys, we're running out of time.
[02:52:19.830 --> 02:52:20.790]  I want to do a couple of things
[02:52:20.790 --> 02:52:21.870]  before we have to wrap it up.
[02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:22.910]  Hi, grandmas.
[02:52:22.910 --> 02:52:23.870]  Yes, exactly.
[02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:25.210]  That's what's next.
[02:52:25.210 --> 02:52:27.270]  I was stumbling across the internet and everywhere I go,
[02:52:27.290 --> 02:52:30.370]  there's videos of grandmas smoking weed for the first time.
[02:52:30.370 --> 02:52:31.490]  Do you think I can play it with sound
[02:52:31.490 --> 02:52:32.330]  and not get in trouble
[02:52:32.330 --> 02:52:33.890]  or should I just cut the sound out of it?
[02:52:33.890 --> 02:52:35.530]  We might want, I mean, honestly,
[02:52:35.530 --> 02:52:37.450]  for legal reasons you might want to hit pause, I think,
[02:52:37.450 --> 02:52:38.810]  just so you don't have to worry about it.
[02:52:38.810 --> 02:52:40.290]  I'll watch it and I'll just keep the volume
[02:52:40.290 --> 02:52:41.570]  to where we can't hear it
[02:52:41.570 --> 02:52:42.970]  so it doesn't go to the recording.
[02:52:42.970 --> 02:52:45.170]  All right, everybody bring it up real quick.
[02:52:45.170 --> 02:52:46.410]  Yeah, go ahead and type in right now,
[02:52:46.410 --> 02:52:49.330]  search for grandmas smoking weed for the first time.
[02:52:49.330 --> 02:52:51.290]  I'll give you a second to search for that.
[02:52:51.290 --> 02:52:53.050]  Yes, that one with the three nice grandmas in the bong.
[02:52:53.050 --> 02:52:55.010]  Yeah, it's three ladies, pink and purple.
[02:52:55.010 --> 02:52:56.450]  The three old ladies wearing pink and purple
[02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:57.790]  and they got a purple bong in front of them.
[02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:59.190]  That's the video you're searching for.
[02:52:59.190 --> 02:53:00.510]  Don't get any weird parody.
[02:53:00.510 --> 02:53:01.750]  I'm gonna hit play right now
[02:53:01.750 --> 02:53:02.710]  and then I'm gonna talk about it.
[02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:03.910]  If you guys need a minute to catch up,
[02:53:03.910 --> 02:53:05.030]  I'll give you a second
[02:53:05.030 --> 02:53:07.990]  and then I'm gonna hit play on three, two, one, play.
[02:53:09.110 --> 02:53:10.710]  YouTube's loading, I'm sorry, I failed.
[02:53:10.710 --> 02:53:13.310]  Oh, okay, it starts off with an old lady taking a bong,
[02:53:13.310 --> 02:53:15.110]  taking a bong, it starts off with another old lady taking,
[02:53:15.110 --> 02:53:16.870]  they don't clear it, they just fill it
[02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:18.070]  and then they leave it all smoky.
[02:53:18.070 --> 02:53:18.910]  But it looks stylish.
[02:53:18.910 --> 02:53:20.110]  Their first timers don't judge them too much.
[02:53:20.110 --> 02:53:21.190]  Yeah, I'm just, well, you know,
[02:53:21.190 --> 02:53:22.390]  I'm trying to narrate here.
[02:53:22.390 --> 02:53:24.030]  It's a six minute video, I don't know if we'll get
[02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:27.670]  to the sound quality, but we'll talk through a lot of it.
[02:53:27.670 --> 02:53:29.590]  Grandma smoking weed for the first time.
[02:53:29.590 --> 02:53:31.550]  It's a very well produced video.
[02:53:31.550 --> 02:53:32.390]  They had a nice camera too.
[02:53:32.390 --> 02:53:33.910]  I'm gonna tease the sound quality,
[02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:34.750]  cause I'm curious.
[02:53:34.750 --> 02:53:37.590]  And we had our cigarettes and our cocktails
[02:53:37.590 --> 02:53:38.790]  and we were happy.
[02:53:38.790 --> 02:53:40.510]  No, I've never smoked marijuana before.
[02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:42.510]  You wanna listen to it, dude.
[02:53:42.510 --> 02:53:44.270]  Crank it up and just enjoy it.
[02:53:44.270 --> 02:53:45.910]  No, I'll watch it when I can one time,
[02:53:45.910 --> 02:53:47.550]  but I don't wanna get us in trouble.
[02:53:47.550 --> 02:53:49.230]  Cause it's the quotes that are beautiful
[02:53:49.230 --> 02:53:52.150]  when the vaporizer gets down on the table.
[02:53:52.150 --> 02:53:53.470]  So let me jump in here.
[02:53:53.470 --> 02:53:55.290]  This dude is about to light the bong
[02:53:55.310 --> 02:53:57.430]  for this nice looking old lady.
[02:53:57.430 --> 02:53:58.950]  She pulled it closer to her face.
[02:53:58.950 --> 02:54:01.310]  He's showing her what's about to happen.
[02:54:01.310 --> 02:54:02.910]  She's shaking the lighter cause it won't work.
[02:54:02.910 --> 02:54:04.390]  She keeps shaking it when she tries to light it.
[02:54:04.390 --> 02:54:05.310]  So now she's toking bro.
[02:54:05.310 --> 02:54:06.350]  She's pulling a toke.
[02:54:06.350 --> 02:54:07.510]  She did not carve it.
[02:54:07.510 --> 02:54:09.030]  No, none of them carve it.
[02:54:09.030 --> 02:54:10.950]  But they weren't instructed to as well.
[02:54:10.950 --> 02:54:13.350]  They were instructed to do everything till then.
[02:54:14.390 --> 02:54:15.530]  Oh, this one old lady.
[02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:18.590]  I'd say she's probably the older of the three.
[02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:20.350]  She just took a pretty nice bong rip.
[02:54:20.350 --> 02:54:22.310]  They start ripping in here in a second.
[02:54:22.310 --> 02:54:24.190]  She's definitely smoked like a hookah before.
[02:54:24.190 --> 02:54:25.030]  And then.
[02:54:25.770 --> 02:54:27.050]  Oh, she goes back for seconds.
[02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:28.210]  And then the Betty White looking chick
[02:54:28.210 --> 02:54:30.890]  is about to line up for a dab or for a bong rip.
[02:54:30.890 --> 02:54:33.690]  I really hope they had some nice munchies after this video.
[02:54:33.690 --> 02:54:35.170]  I was smoking so hard the first time.
[02:54:35.170 --> 02:54:37.090]  Oh, that's a lot of smoke coming out of there.
[02:54:37.090 --> 02:54:39.350]  What it said in the beginning was they gave them snacks
[02:54:39.350 --> 02:54:41.970]  and they gave them drinks and they gave them pot
[02:54:41.970 --> 02:54:44.490]  or cannabis and went with it, you know?
[02:54:44.490 --> 02:54:45.730]  So it's all good.
[02:54:45.730 --> 02:54:47.810]  I don't wanna get myself taken off of fucking iTunes,
[02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:49.090]  but I'm gonna put some of the volume in
[02:54:49.090 --> 02:54:50.410]  for one minute later.
[02:54:50.410 --> 02:54:51.250]  So here, we wanna listen to this.
[02:54:51.250 --> 02:54:53.610]  I think it was easier than I thought.
[02:54:53.610 --> 02:54:54.450]  Yeah.
[02:54:54.870 --> 02:54:58.430]  And I think it was better to do the bong
[02:54:58.430 --> 02:55:02.810]  and not the cigarette, the joint.
[02:55:02.810 --> 02:55:03.650]  All right, that's enough.
[02:55:03.650 --> 02:55:04.470]  I don't wanna get myself in trouble,
[02:55:04.470 --> 02:55:05.690]  but all right, five minutes later.
[02:55:05.690 --> 02:55:06.670]  So I'm just gonna let it play.
[02:55:06.670 --> 02:55:09.510]  And then it's a long video, so we'll put some clips in.
[02:55:09.510 --> 02:55:10.830]  They're starting to feel it now.
[02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:12.470]  I can go ahead and tell you basically from memory.
[02:55:12.470 --> 02:55:13.790]  They're starting to feel it now.
[02:55:13.790 --> 02:55:16.630]  Okay, so it's just three grandmas getting super high
[02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:17.470]  for the first time. Yeah, they're playing Jenga.
[02:55:17.470 --> 02:55:18.870]  It's hilarious. Yeah, they're playing Jenga.
[02:55:18.870 --> 02:55:20.990]  And then she starts playing with it with her second hand
[02:55:20.990 --> 02:55:21.830]  and the other chick's like,
[02:55:21.830 --> 02:55:23.870]  no, you can't, you're not supposed to play with it
[02:55:24.210 --> 02:55:25.050]  with two hands. And there it goes.
[02:55:25.050 --> 02:55:26.730]  She couldn't even do it with two hands.
[02:55:26.730 --> 02:55:29.050]  So 15 minutes later, we'll turn it up for a second.
[02:55:29.050 --> 02:55:30.610]  Oh, they pull out a vaporizer.
[02:55:30.610 --> 02:55:34.410]  Well, I won't tell you what was going through my mind.
[02:55:34.410 --> 02:55:35.250]  Leave it out.
[02:55:35.250 --> 02:55:36.250]  It kinda looks like a sex toy.
[02:55:36.250 --> 02:55:42.060]  I thought it was a dildo,
[02:55:42.060 --> 02:55:44.900]  but I've never seen anything on the end of it like this.
[02:55:46.540 --> 02:55:48.060]  The vaporizer that's been produced
[02:55:48.060 --> 02:55:51.580]  looks like a dildo with a straw coming out of the tube.
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:52.660]  And now she's toking it.
[02:55:52.660 --> 02:55:53.500]  She's actually hitting it.
[02:55:53.500 --> 02:55:55.420]  So I'm gonna jump in a couple of minutes
[02:55:55.420 --> 02:55:56.980]  because I don't wanna watch these old ladies hit a vaporizer.
[02:55:57.960 --> 02:55:59.360]  What's the quotes that they say throughout this
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:02.240]  that make it an insanely popular video?
[02:56:02.240 --> 02:56:03.080]  Oh, they're high now.
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:03.900]  I can see it on their faces.
[02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:06.160]  The middle of the ladies' eyes are just blasted red.
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:08.680]  35 minutes later, we'll give you some volume.
[02:56:08.680 --> 02:56:11.240]  Broadway this season, blank.
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:12.080]  The musical.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:13.040]  Oh, they're just playing card games.
[02:56:13.040 --> 02:56:16.140]  Okay, so it'd be the South or Queefy.
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:25.430]  Queffer, Queffer, Queefy.
[02:56:25.430 --> 02:56:27.190]  Anybody know what Quefing is?
[02:56:27.190 --> 02:56:29.670]  Q-U-E-F-I-N-G.
[02:56:29.670 --> 02:56:30.510]  Queefy.
[02:56:30.510 --> 02:56:31.390]  Anybody know what that really is?
[02:56:31.410 --> 02:56:33.090]  It's a very modern word.
[02:56:33.090 --> 02:56:36.010]  Is it, have the other other terminology,
[02:56:36.010 --> 02:56:36.850]  is there more terminology?
[02:56:36.850 --> 02:56:38.130]  This is three stoned grandmas
[02:56:38.130 --> 02:56:40.250]  about to learn what Queefing means.
[02:56:40.250 --> 02:56:41.210]  Oh, okay.
[02:56:41.210 --> 02:56:42.810]  Fooling around a lot.
[02:56:42.810 --> 02:56:45.530]  The guy says, since you're cool, I'll go ahead and tell ya.
[02:56:45.530 --> 02:56:47.610]  Then it just shows the definition
[02:56:47.610 --> 02:56:49.090]  and one of them is vaginal farting.
[02:56:49.090 --> 02:56:49.930]  I'll turn it back up
[02:56:49.930 --> 02:56:50.750]  because you wanna hear the reaction to that.
[02:56:50.750 --> 02:56:51.590]  Oh, let's do that one.
[02:56:51.590 --> 02:56:52.770]  Oh, they didn't show it.
[02:56:52.770 --> 02:56:53.610]  I'm just worried that-
[02:56:53.610 --> 02:56:54.430]  No, that's what they said.
[02:56:54.430 --> 02:56:55.270]  Oh, let's do that one.
[02:56:55.270 --> 02:56:57.130]  It meant that the answer is something like
[02:56:57.130 --> 02:56:58.530]  Pussy Farts the Musical.
[02:56:58.530 --> 02:56:59.730]  It just, I'm just worried that
[02:56:59.870 --> 02:57:00.710]  we're gonna get in trouble
[02:57:00.710 --> 02:57:01.910]  for playing too much of this video.
[02:57:01.910 --> 02:57:03.030]  But it's on the cannabis
[02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:04.270]  and I feel like we should be able to play it.
[02:57:04.270 --> 02:57:05.910]  But yeah, because this shit's funny.
[02:57:05.910 --> 02:57:06.750]  They're high.
[02:57:06.750 --> 02:57:07.570]  You can tell they're visibly high,
[02:57:07.570 --> 02:57:08.550]  but nothing goes wrong.
[02:57:08.550 --> 02:57:09.630]  These are all ladies that,
[02:57:09.630 --> 02:57:11.350]  one's got like a damn sweater.
[02:57:11.350 --> 02:57:12.670]  I don't know, it's a shawl maybe,
[02:57:12.670 --> 02:57:15.150]  but it looks like a fucking blanket wrapped around her.
[02:57:15.150 --> 02:57:16.750]  That lady's got a scarf.
[02:57:16.750 --> 02:57:20.390]  These look like lunch ladies.
[02:57:20.390 --> 02:57:21.470]  It's videos like this
[02:57:21.470 --> 02:57:25.150]  that take all the scary out of cannabis consumption.
[02:57:25.150 --> 02:57:26.910]  And there at the end,
[02:57:26.910 --> 02:57:28.470]  the main purpose of the story.
[02:57:28.930 --> 02:57:30.330]  Do we want to spoil that for everybody?
[02:57:30.330 --> 02:57:31.170]  Or do we want them to watch it?
[02:57:31.170 --> 02:57:32.330]  No, go and watch this one.
[02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:33.170]  Go search for this.
[02:57:33.170 --> 02:57:33.990]  It's gonna be worth your while.
[02:57:33.990 --> 02:57:35.330]  It's six minutes long.
[02:57:35.330 --> 02:57:36.610]  We're not gonna do the whole thing on the show
[02:57:36.610 --> 02:57:37.610]  because we're running out of time.
[02:57:37.610 --> 02:57:38.450]  I don't even think it's that.
[02:57:38.450 --> 02:57:39.270]  I think five.
[02:57:39.270 --> 02:57:40.110]  I think you guys would approve.
[02:57:40.110 --> 02:57:41.170]  It's funny.
[02:57:41.170 --> 02:57:42.730]  What else did I want to do on the show?
[02:57:42.730 --> 02:57:44.050]  Send it to your grandma.
[02:57:44.050 --> 02:57:46.090]  Send it to your grandma.
[02:57:46.090 --> 02:57:47.970]  I don't know about all that.
[02:57:47.970 --> 02:57:48.890]  That'd be weird.
[02:57:48.890 --> 02:57:49.730]  Send it to your grandma.
[02:57:49.730 --> 02:57:50.570]  Whatever show or that.
[02:57:50.570 --> 02:57:51.390]  Send it to your grandma.
[02:57:51.390 --> 02:57:52.230]  No, it'd be a problem.
[02:57:52.230 --> 02:57:53.070]  Grandma already saw it.
[02:57:53.070 --> 02:57:53.890]  She's on Facebook.
[02:57:53.890 --> 02:57:54.850]  It's creepy.
[02:57:54.850 --> 02:57:55.930]  It's creepy.
[02:57:55.950 --> 02:57:57.350]  All right, let's start wrapping up the show, you guys.
[02:57:57.350 --> 02:57:59.110]  We've gone just about an hour here.
[02:58:00.110 --> 02:58:01.830]  I approve of the movie, A Culture High.
[02:58:01.830 --> 02:58:03.590]  I think the Joe Rogan show kicked ass.
[02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:06.250]  I think this grandma smoking weed video was pretty awesome.
[02:58:06.250 --> 02:58:08.110]  If you don't have some stuff to watch on TV,
[02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:09.590]  if you're bored, pull up your phone,
[02:58:09.590 --> 02:58:11.110]  pull up your computer and watch those things.
[02:58:11.110 --> 02:58:12.350]  It'll be worth your time.
[02:58:13.470 --> 02:58:15.230]  My Instagram on iRegenetics
[02:58:15.230 --> 02:58:18.270]  is getting close to 10,000 followers.
[02:58:18.270 --> 02:58:20.110]  The end of this video says no grandmas were harmed
[02:58:20.110 --> 02:58:21.870]  in the making of this video, which I think is clever.
[02:58:21.870 --> 02:58:22.710]  That's good.
[02:58:22.710 --> 02:58:23.830]  Damn.
[02:58:23.850 --> 02:58:26.370]  My Instagram is at 10,000 followers.
[02:58:26.370 --> 02:58:28.770]  If I'm at 9,400 and something,
[02:58:28.770 --> 02:58:30.570]  if I could get you guys to follow
[02:58:30.570 --> 02:58:32.930]  and get me up to 10,000, that'd be super awesome.
[02:58:32.930 --> 02:58:35.210]  It's at iRegenetics on Instagram.
[02:58:35.210 --> 02:58:36.610]  I don't ask you guys to do a lot of things.
[02:58:36.610 --> 02:58:38.330]  That's all I'm asking for today.
[02:58:38.330 --> 02:58:39.250]  Adam, you got any plugs,
[02:58:39.250 --> 02:58:41.570]  anything you want people to follow, any shout outs?
[02:58:41.570 --> 02:58:44.770]  Overgrowth of Gov, Twitter, Instagram, things like that.
[02:58:45.730 --> 02:58:46.770]  Big shout out to Bender.
[02:58:46.770 --> 02:58:49.490]  Sitting at home, working on the server while I'm here,
[02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:50.850]  having fun, so.
[02:58:50.850 --> 02:58:51.690]  That's it, man.
[02:58:52.630 --> 02:58:55.470]  Local, like Mike is fixing to probably say,
[02:58:55.470 --> 02:58:57.870]  local stuff, get out and do it.
[02:58:57.870 --> 02:58:59.430]  Yep, local shout out stuff.
[02:58:59.430 --> 02:59:00.510]  Well, I was gonna say,
[02:59:00.510 --> 02:59:02.550]  check out the Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws
[02:59:02.550 --> 02:59:04.270]  Facebook page if you're interested
[02:59:04.270 --> 02:59:06.950]  in Pueblo local cannabis news.
[02:59:06.950 --> 02:59:10.310]  And check me out on Twitter, NemoPunk15.
[02:59:10.310 --> 02:59:11.510]  Follow him, guys, support him.
[02:59:11.510 --> 02:59:12.350]  Do you have an Instagram?
[02:59:12.350 --> 02:59:13.190]  I do it, I don't.
[02:59:13.190 --> 02:59:14.670]  I don't Instagram, I don't take pictures
[02:59:14.670 --> 02:59:15.730]  of anything but my dogs,
[02:59:15.730 --> 02:59:18.430]  and I feel like people have seen other people's dogs.
[02:59:18.430 --> 02:59:20.350]  Do they poop in weird places?
[02:59:20.350 --> 02:59:21.630]  Oh, totally.
[02:59:22.290 --> 02:59:23.970]  I've got two females and a male.
[02:59:23.970 --> 02:59:24.810]  You might have an Instagram.
[02:59:24.810 --> 02:59:26.570]  The male's got some poop issues.
[02:59:26.570 --> 02:59:28.370]  Vigor lover grows mids.
[02:59:28.370 --> 02:59:29.690]  I just thought I'd put that out there.
[02:59:29.690 --> 02:59:30.530]  Yeah.
[02:59:30.530 --> 02:59:32.370]  Vigor lover grows mids.
[02:59:32.370 --> 02:59:35.010]  If you want some irigenetic seeds,
[02:59:35.010 --> 02:59:38.050]  pay attention to naturesgreenremedies.com in December.
[02:59:38.050 --> 02:59:39.730]  I'll get them out there as soon as I can.
[02:59:39.730 --> 02:59:41.250]  As soon as I get them packaged up,
[02:59:41.250 --> 02:59:43.650]  I will get them to Nature's Green Remedies.
[02:59:43.650 --> 02:59:45.490]  You'll get hooked up.
[02:59:45.490 --> 02:59:47.050]  I'm gonna start doing that part
[02:59:47.050 --> 02:59:48.690]  where we close out the show.
[02:59:48.690 --> 02:59:50.130]  If I can find the proper paper,
[02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:51.310]  it goes like this, guys,
[02:59:51.310 --> 02:59:53.950]  but pay attention because there's more to the end here.
[02:59:53.950 --> 02:59:54.790]  Now that the show's over,
[02:59:54.790 --> 02:59:56.390]  please go to iTunes or Stitcher.
[02:59:56.390 --> 02:59:58.310]  Go to the iTunes store or the Stitcher main page
[02:59:58.310 --> 02:59:59.510]  and search for iGrow Culture.
[02:59:59.510 --> 03:00:00.430]  Find the review section.
[03:00:00.430 --> 03:00:02.390]  Give us a five-star rating.
[03:00:02.390 --> 03:00:03.230]  Five stars, dude.
[03:00:03.230 --> 03:00:04.670]  We're five stars, right?
[03:00:04.670 --> 03:00:05.510]  Absolutely.
[03:00:05.510 --> 03:00:07.790]  And I love you guys.
[03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:09.390]  And I always try to give you a five-star rating
[03:00:09.390 --> 03:00:11.390]  on Stitcher when I listen.
[03:00:11.390 --> 03:00:12.510]  Nice, thank you.
[03:00:12.510 --> 03:00:13.350]  Yeah, it helps.
[03:00:13.350 --> 03:00:14.790]  I'll give you guys a five-star rating if you give us one.
[03:00:14.790 --> 03:00:15.750]  Yeah.
[03:00:15.750 --> 03:00:17.850]  No, really, tell us what you really think, though.
[03:00:17.850 --> 03:00:19.370]  Give us a rating that you feel like we deserve.
[03:00:19.390 --> 03:00:20.670]  I feel like we got good sound quality.
[03:00:20.670 --> 03:00:21.710]  We got pretty good content.
[03:00:21.710 --> 03:00:24.030]  We try to stay on topic, but we are high.
[03:00:24.030 --> 03:00:26.190]  Tonight was a little spasticky,
[03:00:26.190 --> 03:00:27.830]  but I think we pulled it back together.
[03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:29.510]  We'll be back with better episodes in the future.
[03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:31.350]  We've got Organic As Fuck coming,
[03:00:31.350 --> 03:00:33.150]  and then we've got the nutrients for Adam.
[03:00:33.150 --> 03:00:35.570]  Jesse bailed with the main topic.
[03:00:35.570 --> 03:00:36.750]  Well, I don't wanna throw it all on Jesse.
[03:00:36.750 --> 03:00:38.190]  It wasn't a bail like that was.
[03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:39.470]  He did a hell of a good job yesterday.
[03:00:39.470 --> 03:00:40.510]  He just- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[03:00:40.510 --> 03:00:42.230]  I thought we were blaming Jesse.
[03:00:42.230 --> 03:00:43.070]  You guys did team up on that earlier.
[03:00:43.070 --> 03:00:45.390]  You did agree to blame Jesse, so.
[03:00:45.390 --> 03:00:46.830]  Hashtag blame Jesse.
[03:00:46.850 --> 03:00:49.490]  This awesomeness was Jesse's doing.
[03:00:49.490 --> 03:00:50.610]  Hashtag blame Jesse.
[03:00:50.610 --> 03:00:52.690]  Don't forget that every episode of this podcast
[03:00:52.690 --> 03:00:54.730]  is available, or no, this podcast is available
[03:00:54.730 --> 03:00:57.410]  on iTunes, Stitcher, and every episode is archived

[03:01:19.910 --> 03:01:21.150]  We still need our own theme song.
[03:01:21.150 --> 03:01:23.510]  I wanna give a shout out to Coot Dog from The Mystic Roots.
[03:01:23.510 --> 03:01:24.630]  He helped us out with a lot of music,
[03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:26.310]  but if you wanna make a theme song that says
[03:01:26.310 --> 03:01:29.270]  iGrowCulture hosted by Ross DeGeff or something like that,
[03:01:29.270 --> 03:01:30.950]  I would really super duper appreciate that.
[03:01:30.950 --> 03:01:33.270]  We'd give you mad credit, maybe send you an iReed t-shirt
[03:01:33.270 --> 03:01:36.110]  or whatever I've got laying around that works for you.
[03:01:36.110 --> 03:01:37.750]  I wanna give a huge shout out to Angela
[03:01:37.750 --> 03:01:39.230]  and her perfect vagina.
[03:01:39.230 --> 03:01:40.950]  Shout out to my ninja spits.
[03:01:40.950 --> 03:01:42.030]  Thanks again for listening to you guys.
[03:01:42.030 --> 03:01:43.630]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[03:01:43.630 --> 03:01:45.190]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[03:01:45.910 --> 03:01:50.980]  Bye.
[03:01:50.980 --> 03:01:51.920]  All right, podcast world,
[03:01:51.920 --> 03:01:53.480]  that was a throwback Thursday episode
[03:01:53.480 --> 03:01:54.720]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:57.060]  I hope you love these old throwback Thursday episodes.
[03:01:57.060 --> 03:01:58.840]  I would appreciate it if you send me a tweet,
[03:01:58.840 --> 03:02:01.080]  if you send me an email, if you contact me somehow
[03:02:01.080 --> 03:02:04.660]  and let me know what you think of these long ass episodes.
[03:02:04.660 --> 03:02:05.720]  That was hard to say.
[03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:07.320]  Are these episodes hard for you to download?
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:08.800]  Am I messing up your data plan?
[03:02:08.800 --> 03:02:10.720]  Is there a better way for you to get these old episodes?
[03:02:10.720 --> 03:02:11.920]  That's what I wanna know.
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:14.660]  I wanna make this podcast easily accessible for everybody,
[03:02:14.660 --> 03:02:16.800]  so let me know how I can make it better for you.
[03:02:16.800 --> 03:02:17.960]  If you've got any suggestions
[03:02:17.980 --> 03:02:20.340]  on how I can make this podcast better, let me know.
[03:02:20.340 --> 03:02:22.240]  I might take you up on your advice.
[03:02:22.240 --> 03:02:23.580]  I may just blow you off.
[03:02:23.580 --> 03:02:24.420]  I'd love to hear from you.
[03:02:24.420 --> 03:02:25.240]  You can send me an email.
[03:02:25.240 --> 03:02:27.420]  It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com,
[03:02:27.420 --> 03:02:30.180]  or you can tweet me at GFYH podcast.

[03:02:34.680 --> 03:02:37.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, this file is getting really long.
[03:02:37.480 --> 03:02:38.940]  I appreciate you for listening.
[03:02:38.940 --> 03:02:40.180]  I hope to see you on Monday.
[03:02:40.180 --> 03:02:41.760]  I'll have a brand new episode out.
[03:02:41.760 --> 03:02:42.860]  Check it out.
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:44.820]  Until next time, take a fat dab
