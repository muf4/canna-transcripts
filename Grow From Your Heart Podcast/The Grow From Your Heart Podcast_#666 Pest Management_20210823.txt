[00:04.280 --> 00:11.260]  All right, here we go.
[00:11.260 --> 00:12.860]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:12.860 --> 00:13.860]  I'm your host.
[00:13.860 --> 00:21.700]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 666 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:21.700 --> 00:25.220]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about integrated pest management.
[00:25.220 --> 00:29.300]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout-outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:29.300 --> 00:32.100]  who support the show on Patreon.

[01:01.780 --> 01:05.980]  shout-out and a fist bump to The Dad Haze.
[01:05.980 --> 01:10.140]  Big thanks and big shout-out to everybody who continues to support the show.
[01:10.140 --> 01:13.620]  If you are not already supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how
[01:13.620 --> 01:21.300]  to do so, all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:21.300 --> 01:25.420]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know I did put a link
[01:25.420 --> 01:31.340]  in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:31.900 --> 01:37.300]  Once again, patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:37.300 --> 01:42.540]  Again I would like to invite you to join the iRegenetics Grow From Your Heart Podcast Discord
[01:42.540 --> 01:43.660]  server.
[01:43.660 --> 01:47.700]  We've reached approximately 1100 members of the Discord server.
[01:47.700 --> 01:48.940]  It has been a good time.
[01:48.940 --> 01:50.460]  I hang out in the live chat.
[01:50.460 --> 01:54.500]  I do some video chats, take some dabs, talk about growing, answer a bunch of questions
[01:54.500 --> 01:56.000]  over there.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.340]  Sometimes if I'm packing up seeds or getting orders together, I just hang out in the chat
[02:00.340 --> 02:01.340]  and hang out with the friends.
[02:01.340 --> 02:03.980]  It's like having some company or someone to hang out with.
[02:03.980 --> 02:04.980]  Join me.
[02:04.980 --> 02:06.660]  You never know when I could be in the chat.
[02:06.660 --> 02:11.260]  Also if you've got any questions about anything iRegenetics, the Discord server is a great
[02:11.260 --> 02:12.780]  place to go for information.
[02:12.780 --> 02:16.500]  There are people there right now that are ready to help you, willing to give you advice,
[02:16.500 --> 02:17.780]  guidance, details.
[02:17.780 --> 02:20.020]  They will fill you in.
[02:20.020 --> 02:24.740]  So once again, I do cordially invite you to join us on the Discord server and of course
[02:24.740 --> 02:28.860]  there is a link in the show notes and in the video description.
[02:29.860 --> 02:34.060]  All right, I did say this episode was going to be about integrated pest management.
[02:34.060 --> 02:38.060]  This could take a while so I don't want to ramble too much here at the start of the show.
[02:38.060 --> 02:40.540]  Try to use my voice for the lesson here.
[02:40.540 --> 02:42.060]  So let's get right into it.
[02:42.060 --> 02:43.060]  Integrated pest management.
[02:43.060 --> 02:44.540]  I got a question from Patreon.
[02:44.540 --> 02:48.020]  It said, can you do a series on integrated pest management?
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.700]  There is so much to cover.
[02:49.700 --> 02:52.460]  And I replied with there is so much to cover.
[02:52.460 --> 02:54.060]  So this may be a long episode.
[02:54.060 --> 02:58.580]  I'm not going to get into details on each specific pest.
[02:59.300 --> 03:02.500]  We're going to talk about basic integrated pest management.
[03:02.500 --> 03:03.820]  Let's get right into it.
[03:03.820 --> 03:08.540]  What is the first step to making sure we don't get a, we're going to get, let me start by
[03:08.540 --> 03:11.820]  saying this, you're going to experience bugs in your garden.
[03:11.820 --> 03:13.160]  Shit does happen.
[03:13.160 --> 03:15.380]  We can't stop everything.
[03:15.380 --> 03:18.820]  Sometimes the best way to learn how to prevent a pest is to get a pest.
[03:18.820 --> 03:22.340]  The best way to learn how to eradicate a pest is to get that pest.
[03:22.340 --> 03:25.460]  You never learn about a problem until you have to face it.
[03:25.460 --> 03:27.780]  So you're going to get problems in the growth.
[03:27.780 --> 03:28.780]  Things are going to show up.
[03:28.780 --> 03:30.820]  Powdery mildew is going to show up.
[03:30.820 --> 03:31.860]  Things are going to happen.
[03:31.860 --> 03:37.180]  That is how life goes in a grow environment, whether it's indoors, outdoors, greenhouse,
[03:37.180 --> 03:42.500]  whatever you're doing, there's the huge opportunity, very high likelihood for bugs, especially
[03:42.500 --> 03:47.180]  if you're growing in an area where I grow, where I live, it's legal here.
[03:47.180 --> 03:48.380]  Everybody grows.
[03:48.380 --> 03:52.480]  Everybody works in a commercial facility or a dispensary or their boyfriend or cousin
[03:52.480 --> 03:55.340]  or roommate or somebody is involved in a grow somewhere.
[03:55.340 --> 03:57.020]  So we're all trading bugs.
[03:57.020 --> 03:59.620]  You go to a house to go play video games or smoke with a friend.
[03:59.620 --> 04:03.220]  You sit on the couch and you're just passing spider mites back and forth.
[04:03.220 --> 04:06.700]  You go to your other friend's house, you take the mites there or you get their mites.
[04:06.700 --> 04:08.860]  That's just how it works when everybody works in a grow.
[04:08.860 --> 04:10.660]  So we've got to stay on top of it.
[04:10.660 --> 04:11.780]  You're going to get bugs.
[04:11.780 --> 04:13.180]  Don't let the bugs discourage you.
[04:13.180 --> 04:14.540]  Don't let them scare you.
[04:14.540 --> 04:19.700]  If we know what to do and how to identify bugs before the time comes, we don't panic
[04:19.700 --> 04:20.700]  as much.
[04:20.700 --> 04:25.820]  So I try to be prepared, try to read about what's coming, try to know what to expect,
[04:25.820 --> 04:27.860]  try to Google and research things.
[04:27.860 --> 04:29.860]  I'm going to do a little bit of that work for you.
[04:29.860 --> 04:31.340]  So you're going to get bugs.
[04:31.340 --> 04:36.420]  No matter how well you set up your grow, how well you design your things, things may happen.
[04:36.420 --> 04:39.180]  So don't feel like you've done something wrong.
[04:39.180 --> 04:41.100]  Don't feel like you've got shame or something.
[04:41.100 --> 04:43.140]  You've got something to hide if you've got bugs.
[04:43.140 --> 04:47.140]  It's a good learning opportunity and the pride will come when you defeat the problem and
[04:47.140 --> 04:52.060]  have a successful crop even though you did have some fears in the beginning or middle
[04:52.060 --> 04:53.060]  of the cycle.
[04:53.500 --> 04:54.500]  All right.
[04:54.500 --> 04:58.580]  So that is my kind of disclaimer, my what is that, a preface there?
[04:58.580 --> 05:01.780]  So you're going to get bugs and don't feel like you failed or anything.
[05:01.780 --> 05:05.620]  It's very common, especially in my area, in my industry.
[05:05.620 --> 05:13.740]  So the number one way to prevent problems is to have a plan in place before problems
[05:13.740 --> 05:15.620]  ever even start.
[05:15.620 --> 05:16.820]  Prevention is key.
[05:16.820 --> 05:20.140]  Like I said a moment ago, learn how to identify bugs.
[05:20.140 --> 05:21.140]  Have a strategy.
[05:21.140 --> 05:22.140]  Where are you growing?
[05:22.220 --> 05:24.180]  So I just said that I'm in Colorado.
[05:24.180 --> 05:25.180]  It's legal to grow here.
[05:25.180 --> 05:27.260]  I can have six plants in my home.
[05:27.260 --> 05:28.740]  Everybody's got six plants in their home.
[05:28.740 --> 05:35.740]  Anybody my age, in my age range, if you're 21 to 45, maybe 60, you've probably got six
[05:35.740 --> 05:36.740]  plants in your home.
[05:36.740 --> 05:39.780]  If you've got a medical marijuana recommendation, you can have six more.
[05:39.780 --> 05:42.700]  So you may have up to 12 plants in your home.
[05:42.700 --> 05:46.700]  That means there's probably one house on every block growing, in my opinion, in my experience,
[05:46.700 --> 05:47.700]  honestly.
[05:47.700 --> 05:49.620]  It's about that average.
[05:49.620 --> 05:50.740]  So where are you growing?
[05:50.740 --> 05:55.140]  I know that here in Colorado, everybody, like I said, has got spider mites, powdery mildew,
[05:55.140 --> 05:56.740]  fungus gnats, thrips.
[05:56.740 --> 06:01.300]  We've got all the basic bugs because we're just trading it from commercial facilities.
[06:01.300 --> 06:03.740]  What bugs pop up where you live?
[06:03.740 --> 06:08.220]  If you're growing indoors, outdoors, greenhouse environment, what kind of bugs are known to
[06:08.220 --> 06:11.220]  be present in gardens where you live?
[06:11.220 --> 06:14.940]  If you're outdoors, you could do a quick little Google search and find out what kind of bugs
[06:14.940 --> 06:19.380]  are going to show up in an outdoor garden, and you can be prepared to battle those bugs.
[06:19.380 --> 06:22.740]  Know what they look like, know what their eggs look like, know what kind of signs they
[06:22.740 --> 06:23.740]  leave on the plant.
[06:23.740 --> 06:24.740]  What do they do?
[06:24.740 --> 06:25.740]  Do you see their poop?
[06:25.740 --> 06:26.740]  Do they make bite marks?
[06:26.740 --> 06:28.340]  Do you see eggs?
[06:28.340 --> 06:30.660]  Lots of things will indicate that bugs are there.
[06:30.660 --> 06:34.540]  Know what you're looking for, know how to find them, and have a plan of attack before
[06:34.540 --> 06:37.580]  you even get the bugs, and it will help you out tremendously.
[06:37.580 --> 06:40.940]  A little bit of training ahead of time, and you'll know how to react without going into
[06:40.940 --> 06:42.780]  panic mode.
[06:42.780 --> 06:47.980]  Panic mode in the garden causes more problems than it ever fixes.
[06:47.980 --> 06:52.060]  I see people just decide to do random crazy shit because they had a problem that was a
[06:52.060 --> 06:57.780]  level two, and they're like, well, then I sprayed, I defoliated, I overwatered, I changed
[06:57.780 --> 07:00.860]  the light cycle, and then I fed it completely different nutrients.
[07:00.860 --> 07:04.780]  I'm like, well, you just took that level two problem and made it a level seven by doing
[07:04.780 --> 07:06.980]  too many damn things to the plants.
[07:06.980 --> 07:09.420]  If you know what you're doing, know how to not panic.
[07:09.420 --> 07:15.420]  You've got a much more likelihood of a successful rescue or an eradication of a problem.
[07:15.420 --> 07:16.540]  Know what problems are coming.
[07:16.540 --> 07:17.900]  Know what to expect.
[07:17.900 --> 07:19.980]  What kind of bugs are in your area?
[07:19.980 --> 07:25.940]  Most common bugs for every grow, you're going to see spider mites, fungus gnats, thrips.
[07:25.940 --> 07:27.620]  I'm sure there's other stuff that we'll talk about.
[07:27.620 --> 07:30.100]  Aphids are common, especially if you're growing outdoors.
[07:30.100 --> 07:32.500]  Everybody gets worms and caterpillars outdoors.
[07:32.500 --> 07:34.180]  Know what is coming.
[07:34.180 --> 07:36.020]  Prepare for those things.
[07:36.020 --> 07:43.500]  Then, the next step is to think how nuclear or organic do you want to go to treat your
[07:43.500 --> 07:46.340]  garden for pest prevention?
[07:46.340 --> 07:48.580]  Are you going to spray heavy pesticides?
[07:48.580 --> 07:50.580]  Are you going to spray heavy fungicides?
[07:50.580 --> 07:54.980]  Are you only going to go with organic pesticides and fungicides?
[07:54.980 --> 07:56.700]  Or are you not going to spray at all?
[07:56.700 --> 08:00.060]  Are you going to use predator bugs in your garden?
[08:00.060 --> 08:04.180]  There are many very useful insects that we can order.
[08:04.180 --> 08:06.900]  We can purchase them online or locally from insectiaries.
[08:06.900 --> 08:11.180]  If you have one near you, you can get live bugs delivered to your grow, and you can disperse
[08:11.180 --> 08:15.480]  those live insects in your grow, and they will eat the problem bugs.
[08:15.620 --> 08:18.320]  They will stick around if you buy the right insects.
[08:18.320 --> 08:21.520]  They'll make babies, and they'll keep breeding in your garden.
[08:21.520 --> 08:23.000]  Those bugs are beneficial.
[08:23.000 --> 08:24.000]  They don't eat your plants.
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.200]  They don't cause any problems, and they work as security guards for the other bugs.
[08:28.200 --> 08:31.100]  If some spider might show up, they eat them.
[08:31.100 --> 08:37.520]  If you do decide to use sprays as your plan of attack for pests and fungus, how harsh
[08:37.520 --> 08:41.560]  or gentle of a chemical will you allow yourself to use in your garden?
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.080]  Do you want to use something that is crazy from some Monsanto product, or do you just
[08:46.080 --> 08:48.840]  want to use some hippie oil sprays?
[08:48.840 --> 08:49.840]  Where is your boundary?
[08:49.840 --> 08:51.840]  Where is your threshold there?
[08:51.840 --> 08:53.300]  What will and will you not use?
[08:53.300 --> 08:54.680]  Start thinking about that now.
[08:54.680 --> 08:58.240]  Start researching the products and find out what you are comfortable with.
[08:58.240 --> 09:01.080]  I don't like neem oil.
[09:01.080 --> 09:05.200]  Neem oil will make ... If you're going to use your finished product for concentrates
[09:05.200 --> 09:07.240]  or any ... I don't like neem oil.
[09:07.240 --> 09:09.640]  Neem oil will stick around in the flavor of your product.
[09:09.720 --> 09:14.120]  Most of those botanical oils and essential oils are not good for growing cannabis, in
[09:14.120 --> 09:17.960]  my opinion, because they stick around and you will taste it in the finished product
[09:17.960 --> 09:19.920]  if you use it too much.
[09:19.920 --> 09:22.400]  Let me find my notes again and see where I am.
[09:22.400 --> 09:23.400]  Are you going to spray?
[09:23.400 --> 09:25.440]  Are you going to use predator bugs?
[09:25.440 --> 09:30.920]  I do have a note here that says, in my opinion, ladybugs are basically useless.
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.400]  I know a lot of people are going to throw their arms up in the air and go, what?
[09:33.400 --> 09:35.360]  I love ladybugs.
[09:35.360 --> 09:39.280]  In my opinion, for their price, they are not cost effective.
[09:39.280 --> 09:40.600]  They're not hungry enough.
[09:40.600 --> 09:41.880]  They're not aggressive enough.
[09:41.880 --> 09:43.200]  They don't stick around long enough.
[09:43.200 --> 09:44.760]  They fly away.
[09:44.760 --> 09:47.120]  You release a shit ton of ladybugs.
[09:47.120 --> 09:51.240]  However many ladybugs you release, tomorrow you're only going to have half of them.
[09:51.240 --> 09:55.680]  If it's indoors, outdoors, greenhouse, whatever, half of them are going to fly into the lights.
[09:55.680 --> 09:57.520]  Half of them are going to fly into the blowers.
[09:57.520 --> 10:00.240]  Half of them are just going to die because they don't have any food or they don't know
[10:00.240 --> 10:01.240]  what they're doing.
[10:01.240 --> 10:03.400]  It's just overpopulated with ladybugs suddenly.
[10:03.400 --> 10:04.400]  They just die.
[10:04.400 --> 10:07.000]  Then, by halfway through that day, you've only got a third.
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.400]  By the end of that day, you've probably got a quarter.
[10:09.400 --> 10:11.040]  This is my experience with ladybugs.
[10:11.040 --> 10:12.400]  You let a bunch of them go.
[10:12.400 --> 10:15.040]  You end up sweeping them up, shop vaccing them up.
[10:15.040 --> 10:16.040]  They stink.
[10:16.040 --> 10:17.200]  You end up crunching them on the floor.
[10:17.200 --> 10:20.320]  Now, you've got to mop up the floor because you've got scattered, splattered ladybugs
[10:20.320 --> 10:21.320]  everywhere.
[10:21.320 --> 10:22.320]  I don't prefer ladybugs.
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.240]  I see people talk about it all the time on social media.
[10:27.240 --> 10:28.240]  Ladybugs are amateur hour.
[10:28.240 --> 10:32.880]  There are much more aggressive and qualified bugs out there to do the job for you.
[10:32.880 --> 10:36.800]  Swarskies, persimilis, hypoaspis miles, green lace wings.
[10:37.600 --> 10:40.920]  I know I'm going fast, but you can do some research and you can find those bugs that
[10:40.920 --> 10:42.480]  will work for you.
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.000]  Which predators work in your environment?
[10:46.000 --> 10:50.360]  When you go shopping for predator insects, you can do a lot of research on the website.
[10:50.360 --> 10:55.440]  Hopefully, the website you are looking at will tell you this predator bug prefers this
[10:55.440 --> 10:57.920]  temperature range and this humidity range.
[10:57.920 --> 11:01.120]  The bugs do have a VPD, which they prefer also.
[11:01.120 --> 11:05.600]  If you don't have that type of a VPD, then you may want to get a different bug or your
[11:05.640 --> 11:09.440]  insects that you just bought, your troopers, your army, your soldiers, they may come for
[11:09.440 --> 11:12.400]  a little while and hang out and eat a couple of bugs and they'll go, you know what?
[11:12.400 --> 11:13.840]  It's way too hot in here, bro.
[11:13.840 --> 11:14.840]  They're going to find an escape route.
[11:14.840 --> 11:15.960]  They're going to go somewhere else.
[11:15.960 --> 11:19.080]  They're going to go to a garden where it's a more appropriate temperature or they'll
[11:19.080 --> 11:20.080]  just die off.
[11:20.080 --> 11:23.200]  They'll quit breeding, they'll quit eating, and they will die off.
[11:23.200 --> 11:26.560]  Find out the appropriate predators for your environment.
[11:26.560 --> 11:30.340]  A lot of the good companies, you can call them and they will give you advice and guidance.
[11:30.340 --> 11:36.620]  You can say, this is my greenhouse, my indoor, my outdoor production.
[11:36.620 --> 11:40.580]  Maybe be vague about cannabis, but just, they don't care what plants you're growing.
[11:40.580 --> 11:45.720]  Talk about canopy size and bug infestation and bug pressure is what they will be more
[11:45.720 --> 11:46.720]  worried about.
[11:46.720 --> 11:50.700]  They're going to want to know canopy size, temperature, humidity, environment, environmental
[11:50.700 --> 11:52.500]  swings, things like that.
[11:52.500 --> 11:56.460]  Then they're going to want to know what pest are you trying to eradicate.
[11:56.460 --> 12:01.120]  Also get a good idea of which insects you need for your environment and also be prepared
[12:01.120 --> 12:03.920]  for which insects are coming to your grow.
[12:03.920 --> 12:09.420]  Very commonly, you're going to get spider mites, thrips, fungus gnats, aphids.
[12:09.420 --> 12:13.300]  If you're outdoors, you're going to get those moths that lay eggs in there and those moths
[12:13.300 --> 12:17.300]  turn into worms and they become caterpillars and they become butterflies.
[12:17.300 --> 12:18.780]  I don't know what they are.
[12:18.780 --> 12:22.460]  In Colorado, we get a lot of melon worms here in Southern Colorado.
[12:22.460 --> 12:24.980]  They're orange worms that grow in the buds.
[12:25.020 --> 12:29.100]  They'll really wreak havoc on your plants quite quickly.
[12:29.100 --> 12:32.020]  Which insects do you think you're going to use?
[12:32.020 --> 12:34.060]  Find out if they're cost effective for your area.
[12:34.060 --> 12:36.340]  Can you afford those insects?
[12:36.340 --> 12:38.300]  Learn how you're going to disperse them.
[12:38.300 --> 12:40.880]  Some of them have to be hung up on each individual plant.
[12:40.880 --> 12:43.940]  Some come in a container and you just take off the lid and they start climbing out.
[12:43.940 --> 12:45.780]  You just got to move them around a little bit.
[12:45.780 --> 12:50.520]  Depending on the size of your grow, it may require a little bit of manpower to spread
[12:50.520 --> 12:54.420]  out those sachets or however they are delivered to you.
[12:54.940 --> 12:56.060]  Let me see where I am in my notes.
[12:56.060 --> 12:57.660]  I did get lost.
[12:57.660 --> 12:58.860]  Which predators are you going to use?
[12:58.860 --> 13:00.620]  Which bugs are you going to battle?
[13:00.620 --> 13:02.020]  Now let's talk about spraying.
[13:02.020 --> 13:03.580]  Are you capable of spraying?
[13:03.580 --> 13:06.480]  I don't know how physically capable you are.
[13:06.480 --> 13:12.100]  You may have to mix up a 5-gallon, 10, maybe a 20-gallon container of water with pesticides
[13:12.100 --> 13:16.020]  mixed into it, with fungicides mixed into that, and then you may have to spray a large
[13:16.020 --> 13:17.020]  area.
[13:17.020 --> 13:19.140]  I don't know your physical limitations.
[13:19.140 --> 13:23.460]  I try to keep in mind some people aren't completely physically able like some people are.
[13:23.500 --> 13:26.420]  Maybe you need to get predator bugs and let them out.
[13:26.420 --> 13:29.620]  Maybe you have to spray because you can't disperse the predator bugs.
[13:29.620 --> 13:30.900]  What's going to work best for you?
[13:30.900 --> 13:32.180]  What can you physically manage?
[13:32.180 --> 13:33.180]  Do you have a crew?
[13:33.180 --> 13:34.180]  Do you have a staff?
[13:34.180 --> 13:35.180]  Do you have a helper?
[13:35.180 --> 13:37.740]  Do you have a couple strapping young lads out there that can just be in the heat all
[13:37.740 --> 13:38.740]  day putting out bugs?
[13:38.740 --> 13:41.580]  Or maybe a guy that can suit up in the middle of the day?
[13:41.580 --> 13:42.860]  Don't spray during the day.
[13:42.860 --> 13:44.940]  Can't turn off the lights if you're in the greenhouse.
[13:44.940 --> 13:48.300]  If you're outside or whatever, do you have a guy that can spray when the sun goes down
[13:48.300 --> 13:49.740]  or before the sun comes up?
[13:49.740 --> 13:52.260]  Do you have somebody capable of spraying?
[13:52.260 --> 13:53.340]  Think about that sort of stuff.
[13:53.340 --> 13:56.620]  Are you going to be able to stick to a routine and a cycle?
[13:56.620 --> 13:59.340]  You can get the bugs delivered on a schedule.
[13:59.340 --> 14:04.100]  If you set up a deal with the places that deliver the bugs, they can come once a week,
[14:04.100 --> 14:07.940]  every two weeks, twice a week, however you want to set up a routine.
[14:07.940 --> 14:13.300]  And they'll know what's best for you depending on the infestation, the pest pressure, the
[14:13.300 --> 14:16.980]  beneficial insect you're buying, and the environment in which you're putting it in.
[14:16.980 --> 14:21.100]  The insectiaries will have great recommendations on frequency.
[14:21.100 --> 14:25.300]  And maybe they will try to sell you extra, but it is always better to have extra security
[14:25.300 --> 14:26.580]  guards than not enough.
[14:26.580 --> 14:31.140]  You want more on your team so that the other team can't take over.
[14:31.140 --> 14:34.660]  If your gang is bigger, you got a better chance of winning.
[14:34.660 --> 14:37.460]  Let me keep going to figure out how where I am.
[14:37.460 --> 14:39.860]  Okay, let's talk about spraying now.
[14:39.860 --> 14:42.340]  If you're spraying indoors, that is a good option.
[14:42.340 --> 14:48.900]  I am hesitant of spraying outdoors because in my opinion, I don't want to disrupt the
[14:48.900 --> 14:50.060]  balance outdoors.
[14:50.060 --> 14:51.740]  I don't do a lot of outdoor growing.
[14:51.740 --> 14:55.420]  I may have a greenhouse project happening this year that I haven't talked about, but
[14:55.420 --> 14:57.660]  I don't do a lot of outdoor growing.
[14:57.660 --> 15:02.800]  If I were to grow outdoors, I would use beneficial insects and predator bugs as my way of taking
[15:02.800 --> 15:06.860]  care of pest pressure.
[15:06.860 --> 15:11.800]  My reasoning for not wanting to spray outside is I feel it disrupts the outside.
[15:11.800 --> 15:13.220]  Outside is already doing its thing.
[15:13.220 --> 15:14.220]  It's great.
[15:14.220 --> 15:16.020]  Outside, if we don't mess with it, outside is perfect.
[15:16.020 --> 15:17.860]  It's perfectly sustainable.
[15:17.860 --> 15:20.000]  Humans are what mess up outside.
[15:20.040 --> 15:21.640]  We put our plants out there.
[15:21.640 --> 15:23.960]  We're going to get a bug out there.
[15:23.960 --> 15:26.920]  Something most likely is going to eat that bug.
[15:26.920 --> 15:30.960]  Then that bug is either going to move on or try to make home in our plants.
[15:30.960 --> 15:34.840]  Then in most cases, another bug will come get rid of that.
[15:34.840 --> 15:36.260]  We do have to draw the line somewhere.
[15:36.260 --> 15:39.400]  We can't just have a bug battle happening in our plants every day.
[15:39.400 --> 15:43.440]  There are some things, like I've seen spider mites build webs and take over gardens really
[15:43.440 --> 15:46.520]  quickly without any interaction or prevention.
[15:46.560 --> 15:51.320]  I think that outside, if we mess around too much, we do cause more problems.
[15:51.320 --> 15:56.520]  My opinion, my preference would be to use the beneficial insects for the outdoor grow.
[15:56.520 --> 15:58.200]  That way we're not spraying things.
[15:58.200 --> 16:00.240]  We're not destroying the environment.
[16:00.240 --> 16:03.120]  That patch of land you're growing on may be yours.
[16:03.120 --> 16:04.120]  It may not be.
[16:04.120 --> 16:05.880]  It could be somebody else's land you just snuck on.
[16:05.880 --> 16:06.880]  Don't be a dick.
[16:06.880 --> 16:10.260]  Either way, treat that land with respect.
[16:10.260 --> 16:12.800]  That 10 by 10 patch of land may be yours.
[16:12.800 --> 16:14.840]  Everything around it is ours.
[16:14.840 --> 16:16.080]  Somebody out there owns it.
[16:16.080 --> 16:17.400]  Somebody next door to you owns it.
[16:17.400 --> 16:21.080]  The environment that it is actually a part of is all of ours.
[16:21.080 --> 16:23.080]  Please respect it and take good care of it.
[16:23.080 --> 16:24.920]  I don't know where your sprays are going.
[16:24.920 --> 16:28.840]  I don't know what you're doing to the earth, the environment, the air, all of that stuff.
[16:28.840 --> 16:29.840]  We're sharing it.
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.280]  Keep that in mind, please.
[16:31.280 --> 16:35.960]  I'm sure that most people listening to my show are going to be very gentle and very
[16:35.960 --> 16:37.440]  courteous and very mindful.
[16:37.440 --> 16:42.120]  But still, keep in mind that that patch of land that you're fucking up for this one grow
[16:42.120 --> 16:45.520]  season to have a successful crop, that's also our land.
[16:45.520 --> 16:47.280]  That's also our environment.
[16:47.280 --> 16:48.760]  You won't be here forever.
[16:48.760 --> 16:52.800]  Hopefully that land outlives you and there are other generations that have to live on
[16:52.800 --> 16:53.800]  that land.
[16:53.800 --> 16:55.640]  Let's not make it have to live on that land.
[16:55.640 --> 17:00.880]  Let's make it they get to live on that land that you did not destroy, contaminate.
[17:00.880 --> 17:01.880]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[17:01.880 --> 17:02.880]  Make it infertile.
[17:02.880 --> 17:04.880]  Let's not do that to the land around us.
[17:04.880 --> 17:05.880]  Let's have respect.
[17:05.880 --> 17:07.240]  All right, that's enough of my hippie ramble.
[17:07.240 --> 17:10.280]  But really, you guys, keep that stuff in mind when you're spraying.
[17:10.280 --> 17:12.760]  You're spraying your area, but where's the drift going?
[17:12.760 --> 17:13.920]  Where's the pesticide going?
[17:13.920 --> 17:16.960]  What are the long-term effects you were doing to that plot of land?
[17:16.960 --> 17:19.920]  What are you doing to the ecosystem, the balance, the environment?
[17:19.920 --> 17:23.040]  And now you're going to say, yeah, but you're going to release a bunch of beneficial insects.
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.840]  Yeah, they're beneficial insects.
[17:24.840 --> 17:25.840]  They're going to help the garden.
[17:25.840 --> 17:27.820]  They're not going to, it's not chemical stuff.
[17:27.820 --> 17:30.320]  It's not going to change the earth for a long time.
[17:30.320 --> 17:34.000]  And they're going to help out my fellow neighbor growers by eating their pests as well.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.240]  All right, let me find my notes and get back where I am.
[17:37.240 --> 17:42.180]  Now I know I did mention this already, but think about your strategy before it is time
[17:42.180 --> 17:43.360]  to attack.
[17:43.360 --> 17:44.600]  I know we don't want bugs.
[17:44.600 --> 17:48.640]  I know we don't want to have to get in there or go out there and attack a bunch of bugs
[17:48.640 --> 17:52.000]  and try to fix a problem, but have a plan in place.
[17:52.000 --> 17:53.640]  What are you going to do?
[17:53.640 --> 17:57.200]  Now I keep talking about greenhouse environments, indoor, outdoor environments.
[17:57.200 --> 17:59.760]  Here is a huge piece of advice.
[17:59.760 --> 18:04.160]  We have built, if you have built a nice indoor environment, you've hung up your lights, you've
[18:04.160 --> 18:07.840]  put up the reflective coating on the wall, you've cleaned up the flooring real well,
[18:07.840 --> 18:11.300]  you went and bought a bunch of brand new gear, we ran ducting, we've got a carbon filter
[18:11.300 --> 18:12.300]  in there.
[18:12.300 --> 18:16.580]  If you're growing plants indoors, please don't take them outside.
[18:16.580 --> 18:18.320]  I know you're going to want to take them outside.
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.540]  It's like taking them for a walk.
[18:19.540 --> 18:23.820]  You're going to go get them some fresh air, some sunshine, go expose them to the environment,
[18:23.820 --> 18:28.220]  but you're also going to expose them to all of the bugs that are outside.
[18:28.220 --> 18:32.700]  And then you're going to bring that precious plant with its new passengers, its stowaways
[18:32.700 --> 18:34.940]  into your beautiful grow.
[18:34.940 --> 18:38.820]  Now in your grow, you are creating the most perfect environment.
[18:38.820 --> 18:44.100]  Hopefully, you've got the most ideal environment for that plant, but also that's the most ideal,
[18:44.100 --> 18:48.980]  beautiful, perfect environment for whatever bugs you just brought in on that plant to
[18:48.980 --> 18:50.100]  thrive.
[18:50.100 --> 18:51.100]  They're going to have a party.
[18:51.100 --> 18:54.300]  They're going to say, dude, it is 77 degrees in here.
[18:54.300 --> 18:55.900]  It is the perfect humidity in here.
[18:55.900 --> 18:57.640]  There's not too much wind in here.
[18:57.640 --> 18:59.980]  The light cycle is the same constantly.
[18:59.980 --> 19:01.500]  There's no pest pressure.
[19:01.500 --> 19:02.540]  There's no rain.
[19:02.540 --> 19:04.080]  There's no dew in the morning.
[19:04.080 --> 19:05.080]  There's no problem.
[19:05.080 --> 19:06.700]  We could just have a party in here.
[19:06.700 --> 19:09.340]  It is the island of Jamaica for the pests.
[19:09.340 --> 19:12.420]  They're just going to start partying and then they're going to start breeding in there.
[19:12.420 --> 19:15.740]  And then within a couple of days, you're going to go, oh, I really fucked up putting that
[19:15.740 --> 19:20.240]  plant outside and bringing it back in here because there's nothing to stop that party.
[19:20.240 --> 19:23.140]  They're going to breed and they're going to eat and they're going to breed and they're
[19:23.140 --> 19:26.040]  going to eat and they're just going to take over your garden.
[19:26.040 --> 19:30.520]  So I really recommend not taking your plants outside and bringing them back in.
[19:30.520 --> 19:33.360]  If you've got indoor plants, they should be indoor plants.
[19:33.360 --> 19:36.380]  If you've got outdoor plants, those are outdoor plants.
[19:36.400 --> 19:39.800]  If you've got greenhouse plants, those are greenhouse plants.
[19:39.800 --> 19:44.160]  Really, I wouldn't recommend bringing, I see it all the time on social media, put the plants
[19:44.160 --> 19:47.940]  outside today for a couple of hours and I'm like, oh, you're going to take them indoors
[19:47.940 --> 19:49.960]  and contaminate the entire grow space.
[19:49.960 --> 19:51.960]  Then you got to reclean that whole grow space.
[19:51.960 --> 19:55.140]  Yeah, you've created that beautiful indoor grow environment.
[19:55.140 --> 19:56.500]  Let's just leave them in there.
[19:56.500 --> 19:58.400]  They will appreciate it.
[19:58.400 --> 20:01.040]  Now let's talk about pest management.
[20:01.040 --> 20:03.120]  We have talked about prevention.
[20:03.120 --> 20:06.080]  We've talked about thinking about what we might use.
[20:06.780 --> 20:09.220]  Let's talk about identifying our bugs.
[20:09.220 --> 20:10.760]  Learn to identify bugs.
[20:10.760 --> 20:12.260]  How about now?
[20:12.260 --> 20:14.340]  Maybe you don't have an infestation now, right?
[20:14.340 --> 20:19.540]  How about now while you're listening to me, maybe just Google spider mites, two-spotted
[20:19.540 --> 20:22.340]  spider mites, russet mites.
[20:22.340 --> 20:25.780]  Google all of the common spider mites that could be found in your area.
[20:25.780 --> 20:27.740]  That way you know what they look like.
[20:27.740 --> 20:31.380]  Then let's start looking for what does spider mite damage look like?
[20:31.380 --> 20:35.620]  It looks like somebody just took your leaves and just started poking it with a little needle
[20:35.640 --> 20:39.960]  and all the juices came out of that leaf where you poked it and it just starts getting dry.
[20:39.960 --> 20:42.200]  They call it stipule.
[20:42.200 --> 20:43.640]  I think that's the word.
[20:43.640 --> 20:44.640]  We learned it in art class.
[20:44.640 --> 20:45.640]  I forgot the word.
[20:45.640 --> 20:49.080]  It looks like somebody was just poking at that leaf and just trying to just poke it
[20:49.080 --> 20:50.720]  and make a little ... It'll look gradient.
[20:50.720 --> 20:54.080]  It'll be green and then it'll kind of gradient to like a dead yellowy color.
[20:54.080 --> 20:56.240]  That's where the spider mites are just having lunch.
[20:56.240 --> 20:58.860]  They're probably on the underside of the leaf.
[20:58.860 --> 21:01.160]  Pull off that leaf and take a look at it.
[21:01.160 --> 21:05.240]  Right along the main vein of the leaves, the long main vein, they'll be tucked up there
[21:05.260 --> 21:08.180]  under the edge trying to hide, laying eggs.
[21:08.180 --> 21:12.300]  Maybe you need a microscope or some sort of magnification, but pull off a leaf and take
[21:12.300 --> 21:13.300]  a look.
[21:13.300 --> 21:14.660]  You're going to find them right there at the bottom.
[21:14.660 --> 21:18.940]  Learn to identify the bugs which we are expecting to encounter.
[21:18.940 --> 21:21.100]  Learn to identify spider mites.
[21:21.100 --> 21:23.420]  Learn to identify, ooh, the devil.
[21:23.420 --> 21:25.900]  In my opinion, one of the worst insects to face.
[21:25.900 --> 21:27.340]  I'm not afraid of most.
[21:27.340 --> 21:32.700]  I can battle and conquer almost any infestation you'll get in a grow, whether it's a home
[21:32.700 --> 21:35.360]  grow, a commercial environment, a greenhouse, outdoor.
[21:35.360 --> 21:39.320]  I'm not the expert, but most other places we will conquer all problems.
[21:39.320 --> 21:44.400]  My biggest fear, my biggest adversary would be the russet mite.
[21:44.400 --> 21:45.960]  Those things are the fucking devil.
[21:45.960 --> 21:47.240]  Learn how to identify them.
[21:47.240 --> 21:51.080]  Learn how to identify the signs of their presence in your garden.
[21:51.080 --> 21:52.080]  They will trick you.
[21:52.080 --> 21:54.000]  They will make you think you've got nutrient problems.
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.440]  They'll make you think you've got watering problems.
[21:56.440 --> 21:59.960]  They'll make you think the plants are just doing weird shit and then you'll realize,
[21:59.960 --> 22:02.440]  oh, I've got russet mites.
[22:02.460 --> 22:03.460]  Russet mites are the devil.
[22:03.460 --> 22:04.860]  That's the biggest problem in the garden.
[22:04.860 --> 22:09.340]  I do know how to get rid of them, but it does take a little bit of some strategy and some
[22:09.340 --> 22:10.340]  persistence.
[22:10.340 --> 22:12.180]  You've got to be on top of that shit.
[22:12.180 --> 22:17.820]  Learn to identify those bugs, spotted mites, spider mites, russet mites, aphids.
[22:17.820 --> 22:22.420]  Aphids are easy because aphids have tailpipes.
[22:22.420 --> 22:26.260]  They look like a little Volkswagen Beetle with tailpipes, two exhaust pipes coming out
[22:26.260 --> 22:27.260]  of them.
[22:27.260 --> 22:29.060]  Aphids always have exhaust pipes.
[22:29.060 --> 22:30.260]  They come in all colors.
[22:30.260 --> 22:33.600]  I've been seeing new colors of aphids, which I've never seen before in Colorado.
[22:33.600 --> 22:36.680]  It's like every year we get a new color of aphid.
[22:36.680 --> 22:40.120]  If you've got a little green bug, a little white bug, a little ... It could be purple,
[22:40.120 --> 22:41.720]  brown, yellow.
[22:41.720 --> 22:42.720]  I've seen them of all colors.
[22:42.720 --> 22:45.360]  I haven't seen a blue aphid yet.
[22:45.360 --> 22:46.360]  Have I?
[22:46.360 --> 22:47.360]  No, I haven't seen purple or blue aphids.
[22:47.360 --> 22:50.040]  Anyway, aphids can be all colors.
[22:50.040 --> 22:55.960]  Those weird looking little shiny Volkswagen Beetle looking things that are climbing around,
[22:55.960 --> 22:58.160]  those are possibly aphids in your grow.
[22:58.160 --> 22:59.160]  Thrips.
[22:59.160 --> 23:00.420]  You probably won't see the thrips.
[23:00.420 --> 23:01.420]  They're tiny.
[23:01.420 --> 23:03.380]  What you will see is honeydew.
[23:03.380 --> 23:07.980]  It looks like they blew their nose or something blew its nose on your lower leaves.
[23:07.980 --> 23:10.700]  It'll be on the bottom leaves of the plant because the thrips likes to go hang out in
[23:10.700 --> 23:11.700]  the soil.
[23:11.700 --> 23:14.540]  They come up at night and they shit all over your leaves.
[23:14.540 --> 23:15.940]  That's called honeydew.
[23:15.940 --> 23:17.380]  Thrips are super easy to get rid of.
[23:17.380 --> 23:18.940]  People panic when they see thrips.
[23:18.940 --> 23:20.540]  Those are easy, easy to get rid of.
[23:20.540 --> 23:21.540]  White flies.
[23:21.540 --> 23:25.220]  White flies, you may confuse a thrip or a fungus gnat.
[23:25.220 --> 23:26.660]  Let me fucking try to say that again.
[23:26.660 --> 23:28.260]  I'm not even going to edit that.
[23:28.360 --> 23:29.360]  White flies.
[23:29.360 --> 23:31.320]  You may confuse a white fly with an aphid.
[23:31.320 --> 23:34.600]  If it flies away when you tap the plant, that's a white fly.
[23:34.600 --> 23:37.760]  Sometimes you'll be watering and you'll bump the plant just gently just like I did this
[23:37.760 --> 23:41.980]  mic stand and you'll just see little ashy bugs come flying out.
[23:41.980 --> 23:43.160]  Those bitches are white flies.
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.960]  They are very easy to eradicate.
[23:45.960 --> 23:49.440]  Those are more of an annoyance than a problem.
[23:49.440 --> 23:53.480]  They can be a vector and lead to further issues, but really they're more just annoying and
[23:53.480 --> 23:57.560]  obnoxious than anything else and they fuck up your pictures and they get in your face.
[23:57.580 --> 23:59.420]  Those suck.
[23:59.420 --> 24:00.780]  Just like fungus gnats.
[24:00.780 --> 24:02.780]  Fungus gnats are obnoxious and they fly around as well.
[24:02.780 --> 24:07.060]  If you tap the pot and these little black flies come out, those little bitches are fungus
[24:07.060 --> 24:08.060]  gnats.
[24:08.060 --> 24:09.060]  That's probably from over watering.
[24:09.060 --> 24:13.380]  If you don't over water as frequently, let the soil dry up a little bit, you'll have
[24:13.380 --> 24:16.140]  less likelihood for fungus gnats.
[24:16.140 --> 24:20.340]  Something I've learned, if you run Canon LED lighting from Black Sale Market, big shout
[24:20.340 --> 24:22.140]  out to my buddy Keith at Black Sale.
[24:22.140 --> 24:28.600]  If you run the Canon LEDs, the diode is about the size of a 50 cent piece and I think the
[24:28.600 --> 24:30.400]  fungus gnats are attracted to it.
[24:30.400 --> 24:34.700]  They fly right into that 50 cent piece of a light and they fall directly down onto the
[24:34.700 --> 24:36.480]  plant that is right below that.
[24:36.480 --> 24:40.600]  You could just go scoop them up off of that plant and you'll be able to identify your
[24:40.600 --> 24:41.600]  fungus gnats.
[24:41.600 --> 24:43.800]  You'll know it's like a little indicator, a little marker.
[24:43.800 --> 24:47.160]  You'll know they're there because that LED light is just nuking them.
[24:47.160 --> 24:48.160]  They can't resist it.
[24:48.160 --> 24:50.960]  They fly right into it and they hit it and they go, oh, that's too hot.
[24:50.980 --> 24:53.820]  Then they cook and they just fall right onto the plants below.
[24:53.820 --> 24:54.820]  All right.
[24:54.820 --> 24:58.940]  I did mention that outdoors you're going to get caterpillars and melon beetles.
[24:58.940 --> 25:01.020]  Those are not the easiest to get rid of.
[25:01.020 --> 25:03.700]  You're going to have to treat with some, probably some spray products.
[25:03.700 --> 25:08.540]  I'm not sure what predators are large enough, maybe a praying mantis, maybe a giant lace
[25:08.540 --> 25:13.660]  wing, maybe big enough to eat some of those caterpillars and melon beetles.
[25:13.660 --> 25:16.300]  Those are things you're going to see outdoors, possibly in the greenhouse.
[25:16.300 --> 25:18.900]  I hope you don't get those in the greenhouse.
[25:18.920 --> 25:20.520]  More stuff you might see.
[25:20.520 --> 25:22.080]  Powdery mildew.
[25:22.080 --> 25:23.320]  Powdery mildew is very common.
[25:23.320 --> 25:27.120]  I keep saying it's powdery mildew season here in Colorado.
[25:27.120 --> 25:32.340]  Temperature swings, humidity swings, diurnal swings will definitely lead to powdery mildew
[25:32.340 --> 25:33.680]  here in Colorado.
[25:33.680 --> 25:41.120]  Over foliation, over leafy plants, low circulation, things like that will definitely lead to powdery
[25:41.120 --> 25:42.120]  mildew.
[25:42.120 --> 25:45.400]  Powdery mildew is definitely something you'll run into in a greenhouse environment very
[25:45.400 --> 25:46.400]  commonly.
[25:46.400 --> 25:50.260]  It's a little bit harder in Colorado because we have a lot of drastic temperature changes.
[25:50.260 --> 25:53.300]  Powdery mildew is not very hard to get rid of.
[25:53.300 --> 25:55.460]  It's also very easy to prevent.
[25:55.460 --> 25:57.660]  You can spray a few products on your plants.
[25:57.660 --> 26:02.380]  There are some organic products that you could spray that will work as a preventative.
[26:02.380 --> 26:08.020]  I wasn't going to talk a lot about stuff like that, but I like for a preventative and a
[26:08.020 --> 26:14.300]  corrective product in a powdery mildew situation, I like the products Cease.
[26:14.300 --> 26:18.660]  I haven't used it, but I've seen a lot of great success with Green Cure.
[26:18.660 --> 26:24.860]  And then if it really gets nasty, Xerotol 2.0 is not organic, but it is a good product.
[26:24.860 --> 26:26.520]  We've got a lot of options.
[26:26.520 --> 26:31.740]  But if you spray it with the Cease or a combination of the two, you'll prevent a nice protective
[26:31.740 --> 26:32.740]  layer.
[26:32.740 --> 26:37.120]  Those are beneficial bacterias that eat the powdery mildew or one of them eats the powdery
[26:37.120 --> 26:38.180]  mildew.
[26:38.180 --> 26:43.480]  One creates a surface, a pH on the leaf surface that makes it undesirable for powdery mildew
[26:43.660 --> 26:44.760]  to colonize.
[26:44.760 --> 26:49.320]  So those are a couple of ways to help you prevent powdery mildew prevention there from
[26:49.320 --> 26:50.320]  a fungus.
[26:50.320 --> 26:53.040]  You can do that indoors, outdoors, greenhouse environments.
[26:53.040 --> 26:54.040]  Cease is organic.
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.620]  It's a little bit expensive, but it's cheaper than powdery mildew.
[26:58.620 --> 27:03.720]  Now another thing that is very important when it comes to integrated pest management is
[27:03.720 --> 27:06.280]  scouting and indicators.
[27:06.280 --> 27:07.880]  Do you know what you're looking for?
[27:07.880 --> 27:09.440]  Do you know the signs of pests?
[27:09.440 --> 27:11.680]  I've talked about a couple of things to look for.
[27:11.680 --> 27:14.240]  The spider mites, you're going to see stipuling, little pokies.
[27:14.240 --> 27:16.880]  You're going to see little crawly bugs on the bottom of the leaves.
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.800]  If you see webbing, you've got spider mites and you have not been paying attention.
[27:20.800 --> 27:23.880]  It's time to get in there and get rid of those fucking things.
[27:23.880 --> 27:26.840]  The aphids, you're going to see little skittles crawling around your plants.
[27:26.840 --> 27:28.560]  Thrips, you're going to see the honeydew.
[27:28.560 --> 27:30.480]  Whiteflies, you'll see the ashes flying around.
[27:30.480 --> 27:33.120]  Fungus gnats are little black things flying around.
[27:33.120 --> 27:38.320]  Caterpillars and melon beetles and orange worms, those are going to be obvious.
[27:38.320 --> 27:43.000]  Powdery mildew looks like you're starting to put powdered sugar on the plants.
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.360]  It looks like you were eating a powdered donut and just dribbled it right onto the plant.
[27:46.360 --> 27:47.960]  That's what that looks like.
[27:47.960 --> 27:49.720]  Do you know what you're looking for?
[27:49.720 --> 27:52.600]  Know the signs of bugs and powdery mildew.
[27:52.600 --> 27:55.680]  Also pay attention for bud rot, but that's a little bit later in the season when you've
[27:55.680 --> 27:56.760]  got buds.
[27:56.760 --> 28:00.680]  If the inside of that bud looks brown and squishy and shitty, you've got bud rot.
[28:00.680 --> 28:03.240]  I'm sorry that happened to you.
[28:03.240 --> 28:04.960]  Scouting and indicators.
[28:04.960 --> 28:05.960]  Just the whole crew.
[28:05.960 --> 28:09.640]  If you're working with a crew, more people than just yourself, do they all know what
[28:09.640 --> 28:10.640]  they're looking for?
[28:10.640 --> 28:13.400]  Do you have a specific person scouting every day?
[28:13.400 --> 28:14.760]  Yes, every day.
[28:14.760 --> 28:18.120]  You should look at every plant every single day if you're looking for pests.
[28:18.120 --> 28:23.200]  There should be one person or a team of people trained to identify and scout for pests.
[28:23.200 --> 28:24.760]  What are your indicators?
[28:24.760 --> 28:27.800]  A lot of people use yellow sticky traps in their garden.
[28:27.800 --> 28:31.720]  Unfortunately, they are thinking that that is a pest eradicator.
[28:31.720 --> 28:34.000]  That is not a way to get rid of pests.
[28:34.040 --> 28:37.240]  That is simply there to tell you, you have got pests.
[28:37.240 --> 28:40.480]  You look at the yellow sticky trap every day, maybe twice a day.
[28:40.480 --> 28:42.660]  Maybe take a peek at it before you leave the grow.
[28:42.660 --> 28:47.240]  Take a peek when you come back and see how many bugs are sticking to that yellow sticky
[28:47.240 --> 28:48.240]  trap.
[28:48.240 --> 28:50.080]  You're going to get a few bugs just because life has bugs.
[28:50.080 --> 28:51.520]  There are bugs wherever you are.
[28:51.520 --> 28:52.520]  You may get a fly.
[28:52.520 --> 28:54.200]  I'm sure you saw the little gnat flying around here.
[28:54.200 --> 28:56.880]  You may get some mosquitoes or something stuck to it.
[28:56.880 --> 29:00.640]  But do you have a bunch of white flies or a bunch of fungus gnats or a bunch of something
[29:00.640 --> 29:03.280]  unidentifiable stuck to those sticky cards?
[29:03.280 --> 29:04.280]  Pay attention.
[29:04.280 --> 29:05.280]  Let them be indicators.
[29:05.280 --> 29:11.040]  As soon as you see that number getting towards concerning, it's time to step up your prevention.
[29:11.040 --> 29:13.000]  Maybe start doing an eradication.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.860]  Maybe start putting more beneficial insects into the room.
[29:15.860 --> 29:20.080]  It's time to start rethinking your strategy if you are seeing the numbers on the cards
[29:20.080 --> 29:21.380]  get too high.
[29:21.380 --> 29:22.380]  Do scouting.
[29:22.380 --> 29:23.380]  Don't be afraid.
[29:23.380 --> 29:25.860]  I talk a lot about defoliating.
[29:25.860 --> 29:29.100]  When you're defoliating, don't be afraid to take off a few leaves and flip them upside
[29:29.100 --> 29:32.960]  down and take a moment to see what you've got going on on the bottom of those leaves.
[29:32.960 --> 29:33.960]  Are there bugs?
[29:33.960 --> 29:34.960]  Are there eggs?
[29:34.960 --> 29:35.960]  Take some time.
[29:35.960 --> 29:36.960]  Enjoy your plants.
[29:36.960 --> 29:37.960]  Spend a minute with them.
[29:37.960 --> 29:38.960]  Inspect them.
[29:38.960 --> 29:39.960]  Scout them.
[29:39.960 --> 29:43.280]  Now, let's talk about plant damage and other signs of trouble.
[29:43.280 --> 29:45.040]  Do you see signs of trouble?
[29:45.040 --> 29:46.040]  Do you see plant damage?
[29:46.040 --> 29:47.680]  I've told you what to look for.
[29:47.680 --> 29:50.000]  Are you in there every day looking for it?
[29:50.000 --> 29:51.000]  The problem.
[29:51.000 --> 29:54.480]  The problem plant, I can already tell you, it's the one in the back corner that you don't
[29:54.480 --> 29:55.840]  fuck with enough.
[29:55.840 --> 29:57.560]  That's the one that's got the bugs on it.
[29:57.560 --> 29:59.120]  Get back there and look at it.
[29:59.120 --> 30:00.120]  Love that plant.
[30:00.120 --> 30:01.120]  Give it kisses.
[30:01.120 --> 30:02.920]  Why are you avoiding that one plant?
[30:02.920 --> 30:03.920]  What did it do to you?
[30:03.920 --> 30:05.360]  There's always that one in the grow.
[30:05.360 --> 30:07.720]  It's always just back there or back there in the corner.
[30:07.720 --> 30:10.760]  That's the one with bugs and those bugs are going to move on pretty soon and they're going
[30:10.760 --> 30:12.040]  to be in the whole grow.
[30:12.040 --> 30:14.240]  So look for signs of damage.
[30:14.240 --> 30:15.760]  Do you know what you're looking for?
[30:15.760 --> 30:17.840]  Do you know what kind of bugs are doing that damage?
[30:17.840 --> 30:22.200]  Now, do you know how to react properly with intent and purpose?
[30:22.200 --> 30:26.640]  Just because you see bug damage doesn't mean you need to go get pesticide A and heavily
[30:26.640 --> 30:31.120]  spray pesticide A. What if the pesticide you just got is for spider mites and the bugs
[30:31.120 --> 30:32.820]  that you've got are thrips?
[30:32.820 --> 30:33.820]  Is it going to work?
[30:33.820 --> 30:37.380]  Is it going to do anything or did you just spray the plants with some stressful shit,
[30:37.380 --> 30:40.740]  spend some money, spend some time, spend some energy on the wrong thing?
[30:40.740 --> 30:45.340]  Let's identify the pest, do some research on the appropriate product or beneficial insect
[30:45.340 --> 30:50.180]  to eradicate that pest and apply with intent and purpose.
[30:50.180 --> 30:52.600]  Have a strategy, have a schedule.
[30:52.600 --> 30:55.980]  How often do you need to apply this product?
[30:55.980 --> 30:59.440]  How many days apart do I need to wait to apply this product?
[30:59.440 --> 31:04.720]  What other products can I apply with this and what other products can I not apply with
[31:04.720 --> 31:05.720]  this?
[31:05.720 --> 31:09.920]  Some things you can't mix, some things you can mix, some things you shouldn't spray,
[31:09.920 --> 31:13.400]  maybe five to seven days apart from each other, you may want to wait.
[31:13.400 --> 31:17.740]  If you treat with any sulfur products, don't treat with any oils for five to seven days
[31:17.740 --> 31:20.360]  before or after and the opposite.
[31:20.360 --> 31:21.600]  Sulfurs and oils shouldn't mix.
[31:21.600 --> 31:24.080]  It's going to give you huge problems on your plants.
[31:24.080 --> 31:27.980]  So be ready to react properly with intent and purpose.
[31:28.900 --> 31:32.500]  A good idea is to have multiple modes of attack.
[31:32.500 --> 31:38.100]  If you've got swarskies and persimilis and hypoaspis miles and lacewings in there, you've
[31:38.100 --> 31:40.960]  got multiple modes of attack, three different bugs going in there.
[31:40.960 --> 31:44.140]  You can't run and hide from three or four different bugs.
[31:44.140 --> 31:48.620]  But if you've got a tank mix with multiple ingredients, you can spray multiple things
[31:48.620 --> 31:50.600]  in the garden at one time.
[31:50.600 --> 31:54.040]  That way you hit with multiple modes of attack.
[31:54.040 --> 31:58.000]  Some pesticides simply make the plants undesirable for the bugs.
[31:58.000 --> 31:59.880]  The bugs are like, oh, that's sticky and stinky.
[31:59.880 --> 32:01.420]  I don't want to go there.
[32:01.420 --> 32:06.960]  Other pesticides will infect your bugs with a mushroom or a fungus that grows inside of
[32:06.960 --> 32:09.200]  them and then explodes them.
[32:09.200 --> 32:13.560]  Other pesticides will simply make the bugs forget to eat and then they just don't eat
[32:13.560 --> 32:14.740]  and they die.
[32:14.740 --> 32:17.380]  Some pesticides will make the bugs unable to breed.
[32:17.380 --> 32:20.040]  So they'll just keep going, but they can't make any more.
[32:20.040 --> 32:21.600]  So multiple modes of attack.
[32:21.600 --> 32:25.160]  What if I hit you with the pesticide that makes you not want to breed and forget to
[32:25.160 --> 32:27.680]  eat and now you're just not eating and you're not breeding.
[32:27.680 --> 32:29.880]  You're just walking around going, I don't have a purpose.
[32:29.880 --> 32:32.600]  And then you die and you don't come back and the bugs are gone.
[32:32.600 --> 32:36.680]  So if you hit with multiple modes of attack, you can definitely eradicate your problems
[32:36.680 --> 32:38.500]  more quickly.
[32:38.500 --> 32:40.200]  Here is something to keep in mind.
[32:40.200 --> 32:45.000]  I'm talking about multiple modes of attack and multiple products and a tank mix.
[32:45.000 --> 32:49.080]  Bugs will get what is known as resistance to a pesticide.
[32:49.080 --> 32:52.400]  Just think about if you walk in the room every day and I punch you right in the jaw
[32:52.400 --> 32:55.520]  every day, day one is going to fucking hurt.
[32:55.520 --> 32:57.000]  Day two, it's going to hurt.
[32:57.000 --> 32:58.160]  Day three, it's going to suck.
[32:58.160 --> 33:00.840]  Day four, all right, I got punched in the jaw again.
[33:00.840 --> 33:02.280]  Day five, yup.
[33:02.280 --> 33:03.880]  Day six, right in the jaw.
[33:03.880 --> 33:06.600]  By day 12, you're just going to walk out the door and you're just going to put your jaw
[33:06.600 --> 33:08.860]  up there and take it and keep doing your thing.
[33:08.860 --> 33:12.760]  If you keep spraying the bugs the same thing over and over and over again, they're going
[33:12.760 --> 33:16.120]  to start drinking it up like Kool-Aid and it's not going to do anything to them.
[33:16.160 --> 33:20.040]  It doesn't take very long for some of these new bugs.
[33:20.040 --> 33:22.680]  We've evolved these bugs so quickly by doing this.
[33:22.680 --> 33:28.160]  They've developed such quick resistance to pesticides that we've got to rotate and use
[33:28.160 --> 33:30.240]  multiple modes of attack.
[33:30.240 --> 33:33.880]  Rotate your pesticides to prevent resistance.
[33:33.880 --> 33:40.040]  One thing that the bug lady, Suzanne, says, you cannot build a resistance to being eaten.
[33:40.040 --> 33:44.440]  If you want to use those predator bugs, they will always win because you cannot build a
[33:44.560 --> 33:46.880]  resistance to being eaten.
[33:46.880 --> 33:49.400]  There's no resistance, especially if you power in numbers.
[33:49.400 --> 33:53.880]  If you overdo it with those predator insects, you will definitely win.
[33:53.880 --> 33:55.000]  Let's see.
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.920]  I've already said that I don't like neem oil.
[33:56.920 --> 34:01.720]  I don't like oils with a lot of fragrances, especially like spearmint oils, peppermint
[34:01.720 --> 34:06.840]  oils, any of that sticky oil that you spray on the plants that you can see it kind of
[34:06.840 --> 34:09.080]  stick and leave a shine onto the plant.
[34:09.080 --> 34:14.160]  I don't like spraying that sort of stuff because I make a lot of concentrates out of my products.
[34:14.160 --> 34:17.080]  I want to smoke a concentrate that is oil free.
[34:17.080 --> 34:21.920]  When you make concentrates from products that have been sprayed with oils, you can see an
[34:21.920 --> 34:27.520]  experienced concentrate maker, consumer, I'm not even an experienced maker and I can see
[34:27.520 --> 34:28.520]  it.
[34:28.520 --> 34:32.800]  I can see the oils float to the top of the concentrates when you're putting oils and
[34:32.800 --> 34:34.500]  weird sprays and shit in the plants.
[34:34.500 --> 34:35.760]  We can see it.
[34:35.760 --> 34:37.000]  Some people know how to remove it.
[34:37.000 --> 34:38.440]  I don't know how to do that part.
[34:38.440 --> 34:41.120]  That's not my area of expertise, but I can see it.
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.680]  I can identify it on the top of the concentrates.
[34:43.680 --> 34:47.600]  A little oily sheen, just like if you mix oil and water together, you can watch the
[34:47.600 --> 34:48.640]  oil float.
[34:48.640 --> 34:49.640]  I can see that.
[34:49.640 --> 34:53.080]  I can see the pesticides when the products are being processed.
[34:53.080 --> 34:55.200]  So I don't like a lot of crazy hippie oils.
[34:55.200 --> 35:01.300]  I would rather just go with a pesticide or insects than some of those lower level hippie
[35:01.300 --> 35:02.760]  oils they sell at the store.
[35:02.760 --> 35:04.040]  You know which brands I'm talking about.
[35:04.040 --> 35:06.640]  I skip all of that stuff.
[35:06.640 --> 35:08.960]  Now spray properly.
[35:08.960 --> 35:11.960]  Whatever you're going to spray, spray properly.
[35:11.960 --> 35:14.200]  Do you need to spray the top of the leaf?
[35:14.200 --> 35:16.640]  Do you need to spray the underside of the leaf?
[35:16.640 --> 35:19.960]  Some products like to be sprayed what is called to runoff.
[35:19.960 --> 35:23.280]  So you spray the plants until they're just fucking dripping to where you got a puddle
[35:23.280 --> 35:28.280]  of pesticide or off spray around the bottom of the plant.
[35:28.280 --> 35:31.520]  Some pesticides do not want to be sprayed to runoff.
[35:31.520 --> 35:35.080]  So they just want you to spray the plant with enough just to get enough of it on there and
[35:35.080 --> 35:36.320]  it stays there.
[35:36.320 --> 35:39.760]  And then some of them, you got to spray the underside of the leaf extreme.
[35:39.760 --> 35:42.760]  Like if you got spider mites, you need to spray the underside of the leaves because
[35:42.760 --> 35:44.260]  that's where the bugs are.
[35:44.260 --> 35:47.320]  If you're spraying for powdery mildew, you need to spray the top because that's where
[35:47.320 --> 35:49.480]  the powdery mildew is going to go.
[35:49.480 --> 35:52.320]  So understand how to spray properly.
[35:52.320 --> 35:57.040]  Also understand the pesticides you are using.
[35:57.040 --> 36:00.440]  This is something I probably should have started with, but every bottle that you're going to
[36:00.440 --> 36:03.420]  use has a booklet on the front.
[36:03.420 --> 36:08.200]  Open up that booklet and read about the re-entry interval.
[36:08.200 --> 36:12.680]  When you spray a pesticide, there's amount of time you should leave your grow and not
[36:12.680 --> 36:16.520]  enter that because those pesticides are fresh and flying around.
[36:16.520 --> 36:18.960]  You just sprayed bubbles in there and you got wet pesticide in there.
[36:18.960 --> 36:21.120]  You don't want to be rubbing up against it.
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.280]  You don't want that in your lungs, in your skin.
[36:23.280 --> 36:29.240]  There is something called the re-entry interval written on that booklet inside on your pesticides.
[36:29.240 --> 36:30.240]  Read that book.
[36:30.240 --> 36:31.840]  There is so much information in there.
[36:31.840 --> 36:33.820]  There are dosage recommendations.
[36:33.820 --> 36:38.280]  There is a part that tells you what personal protective equipment to wear.
[36:38.280 --> 36:43.180]  Always wear the appropriate personal protective equipment when applying any type of pesticide.
[36:43.180 --> 36:47.780]  If you're just spraying water, if you're making small enough bubbles, I like to wear a mask
[36:47.780 --> 36:48.780]  or a respirator.
[36:48.780 --> 36:52.860]  I don't want to inhale micronized bubbles of anything into my lungs.
[36:52.860 --> 36:54.980]  That doesn't sound like a good idea.
[36:54.980 --> 36:57.420]  We got enough shit to deal with right now with our lungs.
[36:57.420 --> 37:01.260]  Let's try to not poison, contaminate, and injure ourselves while trying to take care
[37:01.260 --> 37:02.260]  of our plants.
[37:02.700 --> 37:05.780]  Proper personal protective equipment at all times.
[37:05.780 --> 37:08.940]  It will be listed inside of the pesticide book.
[37:08.940 --> 37:12.180]  Right on the front of the bottle, you just pull out this one little book.
[37:12.180 --> 37:13.760]  All the info you need is right there.
[37:13.760 --> 37:14.760]  Just read the book.
[37:14.760 --> 37:19.160]  It's only going to take you a couple of minutes and it may really, really help you out.
[37:19.160 --> 37:22.020]  Use all of the recommended personal protective equipment.
[37:22.020 --> 37:23.020]  Always use gloves.
[37:23.020 --> 37:25.120]  I recommend a paper Tyvek suit.
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.220]  If you can't invest in that, get a long sleeve shirt.
[37:28.220 --> 37:29.220]  Wear that.
[37:29.220 --> 37:30.220]  Get some long pants.
[37:30.220 --> 37:32.780]  Get some long shoes and socks in the grow that cover up your feet.
[37:32.780 --> 37:38.300]  The bottoms of your feet are one of the most absorbent parts for contaminants and pesticides.
[37:38.300 --> 37:43.780]  Think about spray pesticide, drips off the plant, lands on the floor, you're barefoot,
[37:43.780 --> 37:48.460]  you step on that shit, you're going to get maximum pesticide absorption and exposure
[37:48.460 --> 37:50.820]  that you could possibly get through the bottoms of your feet.
[37:50.820 --> 37:51.820]  There are a couple other spots.
[37:51.820 --> 37:56.980]  Of course, your genitals because you got that thin soft skin, armpits, face, but the bottoms
[37:56.980 --> 38:01.020]  of your feet are a prime spot for you to accidentally contaminate yourself.
[38:01.020 --> 38:05.420]  Please wear the appropriate personal protective equipment and read the bottles.
[38:05.420 --> 38:10.340]  Learn about the equipment, the re-entry intervals, and learn about the toxicity levels of those
[38:10.340 --> 38:11.860]  products you're using.
[38:11.860 --> 38:15.700]  Does it say like warning, hazard, danger, poison?
[38:15.700 --> 38:17.480]  It's going to have words like that on there.
[38:17.480 --> 38:19.540]  Know what you're working with.
[38:19.540 --> 38:24.300]  Also, maybe have the MSDS sheets available.
[38:24.300 --> 38:25.860]  Maybe have a spray log available.
[38:25.860 --> 38:28.380]  If you're in a commercial environment, those are required.
[38:28.380 --> 38:31.740]  If you're in a personal grow, you can get crazy and willy-nilly with all that shit,
[38:31.740 --> 38:37.740]  but still, it would be a good idea to have a binder with an MSDS log for all of your
[38:37.740 --> 38:38.740]  products.
[38:38.740 --> 38:42.620]  That's simply find every product you've got and go to the internet, go to the website,
[38:42.620 --> 38:44.480]  type in whatever product.
[38:44.480 --> 38:46.900]  I don't have any liquid products near me.
[38:46.900 --> 38:51.900]  I can see a bottle of CIS, so CIS Biological Pesticide or Fungicide, whatever it says on
[38:51.900 --> 38:52.900]  there.
[38:52.940 --> 38:56.180]  CIS product, MSDS sheet, and you'll find it.
[38:56.180 --> 38:58.220]  Every product has an MSDS sheet available.
[38:58.220 --> 38:59.220]  They have to.
[38:59.220 --> 39:00.220]  Print it.
[39:00.220 --> 39:04.420]  I buy these little ... It's like a little laminate folder that you'd keep for a presentation
[39:04.420 --> 39:05.420]  and a folder.
[39:05.420 --> 39:08.900]  I just print them off and I slide them all into there and make a notebook out of them.
[39:08.900 --> 39:13.380]  That way, if anything does go wrong, if I do end up sick, if I do ingest something,
[39:13.380 --> 39:17.020]  I can grab that folder, I can grab my pesticide log, and I can go to the hospital and I can
[39:17.020 --> 39:21.080]  say there's probably clues in here, and then they can help me out or maybe somebody can
[39:21.080 --> 39:23.880]  take that shit for me if I'm not able to do it.
[39:23.880 --> 39:26.080]  Just good ideas to protect yourself.
[39:26.080 --> 39:30.160]  That may be a different strategy if you were in what is known as a red state.
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.080]  Maybe you don't ... That's all evidence at this point in a red state, so be careful with
[39:34.080 --> 39:35.080]  that decision.
[39:35.080 --> 39:40.960]  But I do like to have the MSDS sheets, a spray log, try to have all that stuff available.
[39:40.960 --> 39:42.520]  You never know what could go wrong.
[39:42.520 --> 39:46.800]  I was trained by the Department of Agriculture, the Colorado Department of Agriculture, to
[39:46.800 --> 39:49.840]  keep those types of records in a commercial environment.
[39:49.840 --> 39:50.840]  It's required.
[39:51.600 --> 39:55.040]  You have all that stuff for I think three to five years.
[39:55.040 --> 39:57.200]  It all has to be kept on file.
[39:57.200 --> 40:00.000]  The compliance officer knows how many years she keeps it all for us.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.680]  But shout out to your compliance officer wherever you are.
[40:03.680 --> 40:05.680]  I am super off topic now.
[40:05.680 --> 40:06.680]  Where are we?
[40:06.680 --> 40:08.520]  Keep those books, keep all that stuff documented.
[40:08.520 --> 40:12.600]  And then I was saying I'm trained by the Department of Agriculture.
[40:12.600 --> 40:17.440]  I guess maybe it would be a good time to drop my credentials in here since I'm talking about
[40:17.440 --> 40:20.280]  pesticides, applications, all this safety and stuff.
[40:20.720 --> 40:22.440]  You're going, well, who the hell are you, bro?
[40:22.440 --> 40:23.440]  That's a good question.
[40:23.440 --> 40:29.240]  I have got a training from the Colorado Department of Agriculture and the Colorado State University.
[40:29.240 --> 40:32.560]  I was trained by a very great lady named Thea Walker.
[40:32.560 --> 40:37.920]  I took like a, it was either a six or eight hour class at a cool building in Denver.
[40:37.920 --> 40:40.800]  There were very few people in that class, but it was a good time.
[40:40.800 --> 40:47.520]  And she taught us in great detail about pesticides, pesticide handling, pesticide application,
[40:47.520 --> 40:48.720]  pesticide exposure.
[40:48.720 --> 40:49.960]  She taught us a great class.
[40:50.640 --> 40:53.720]  I am what is called train the trainer certified.
[40:53.720 --> 40:59.000]  I can go to commercial grows in the state of Colorado and I can teach them how to be
[40:59.000 --> 41:00.160]  pesticide compliant.
[41:00.160 --> 41:04.840]  I can train other people to train the staff how to be pesticide compliant.
[41:04.840 --> 41:06.360]  So that is my credential.
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.160]  I'm trained the trainer certified, which means I can train other trainers.
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.840]  I go to the grow and I train the lead grower and he teaches the staff or I just do a big
[41:14.840 --> 41:19.040]  meeting, teach the whole class all at one time, teach up the whole gang.
[41:19.120 --> 41:20.120]  So those are my credentials.
[41:20.120 --> 41:24.960]  I do have a little bit of training with pesticides, pesticide application, handling and safety.
[41:24.960 --> 41:29.200]  I'm not just talking out of my ass on this episode of the others.
[41:29.200 --> 41:30.200]  Use your best judgment.
[41:30.200 --> 41:32.480]  Um, all right, where am I?
[41:32.480 --> 41:33.840]  I've got a lot of notes here.
[41:33.840 --> 41:36.160]  I try to just freestyle because it feels better.
[41:36.160 --> 41:39.400]  I feel like I get in a good flow of the notes make me feel too robotic.
[41:39.400 --> 41:40.400]  Uh, spray properly.
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.320]  Do you need to spray the top, the bottom, uh, runoff or not?
[41:44.320 --> 41:46.560]  Then the next part is soil drench.
[41:46.560 --> 41:51.200]  A lot of our pests, uh, live on the leaves and hang out in the plants, but a lot of them
[41:51.200 --> 41:53.880]  retreat to the soil, uh, for safety.
[41:53.880 --> 41:55.640]  We can shake the plants, we can disrupt things.
[41:55.640 --> 41:58.920]  They just go hide down in the dirt because a lot of things can't get to them.
[41:58.920 --> 42:04.800]  So for those pests, that's when I would recommend what is known as a soil dredge or a soil drench.
[42:04.800 --> 42:09.840]  There are many great products you can use to get rid of many common pests in your soil.
[42:09.840 --> 42:13.180]  Most commonly you're going to find a fungus gnats in your soil.
[42:13.180 --> 42:15.680]  You may find root aphids in your soil.
[42:15.800 --> 42:22.840]  Those are all easy to defeat with a root drench, a root drench or a spray.
[42:22.840 --> 42:28.120]  Any kind of pesticide treatment needs to be done on a good solid schedule.
[42:28.120 --> 42:30.040]  I spray in a commercial environment.
[42:30.040 --> 42:33.040]  Uh, if we don't have any issues, I spray every Monday.
[42:33.040 --> 42:38.080]  If I see one sign of issues, we spray every Monday and every Thursday.
[42:38.080 --> 42:42.160]  If I see something in the soil, we'll do a soil drench on Monday and then we'll do another
[42:42.160 --> 42:44.120]  soil drench on the next Monday.
[42:44.120 --> 42:48.600]  If I feel like there's still an issue, we'll hit the soil again on Thursday along with
[42:48.600 --> 42:49.600]  those sprays.
[42:49.600 --> 42:52.200]  So we're spraying up top and we're soaking the soil.
[42:52.200 --> 42:56.680]  We're really trying to attack from all angles with multiple modes of attack.
[42:56.680 --> 42:59.440]  So a soil dredge is not a problem.
[42:59.440 --> 43:02.240]  Never be afraid to soil dredge those plants.
[43:02.240 --> 43:07.280]  If you've got a soil born insect, something like a fungus gnat, something like a root
[43:07.280 --> 43:12.520]  aphid, a really easy product to soil drench with is evergreen.
[43:12.520 --> 43:14.280]  Maybe 15 to 30 mils of evergreen.
[43:14.280 --> 43:15.280]  Is that correct?
[43:15.280 --> 43:16.280]  I don't want to steer you wrong.
[43:16.280 --> 43:17.280]  That came out really naturally.
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.800]  Uh, 15 to 30 milliliter milliliters of evergreen per gallon of water.
[43:21.800 --> 43:23.120]  A nice soil dredge.
[43:23.120 --> 43:24.160]  Start off with the 15.
[43:24.160 --> 43:25.160]  See if that helps you out.
[43:25.160 --> 43:29.160]  The plants are going to kind of react, uh, soil dredge till you get some runoff that
[43:29.160 --> 43:30.840]  should help get rid of your bugs.
[43:30.840 --> 43:33.920]  I'm going to do research and make sure I said the right numbers when I edit.
[43:33.920 --> 43:37.600]  Um, so we got a soil dredge for soil born pests.
[43:37.600 --> 43:41.920]  Uh, if you're hitting the soil and you're hitting the foliage and the plants and the
[43:41.920 --> 43:46.040]  room is right, you're definitely going to be on the right path to getting rid of all
[43:46.040 --> 43:47.680]  of those problem bugs.
[43:47.680 --> 43:51.520]  But keep in mind if you're using predators, we can't go spraying some things.
[43:51.520 --> 43:55.200]  We can't spray most things and we definitely can't use most of these soil dredges.
[43:55.200 --> 43:56.560]  They will destroy your predators.
[43:56.560 --> 43:59.320]  So that's going to be some strategy to work on there.
[43:59.320 --> 44:05.060]  The most important part to all of this is to have a routine and a plan and a strategy.
[44:05.060 --> 44:08.120]  If you just go in there on Monday and spray and think I got rid of it all.
[44:08.120 --> 44:09.120]  No, you didn't.
[44:09.120 --> 44:13.600]  You killed the live bugs or you killed the eggs, but the opposite is still there.
[44:13.600 --> 44:15.520]  There's still a small population that you missed.
[44:15.520 --> 44:17.200]  You've got to be on top of it.
[44:17.200 --> 44:19.760]  That's why I spray every Monday and every Thursday.
[44:19.760 --> 44:24.240]  If I see any issues get in there Monday with one or two pesticides, then get in there on
[44:24.240 --> 44:27.240]  Thursday with one or two different pesticides.
[44:27.240 --> 44:31.400]  Then go back Monday with one of the products I used on Monday, one of the products I used
[44:31.400 --> 44:32.480]  on Thursday.
[44:32.480 --> 44:36.340]  Then on Thursday I'll use the other two products and we'll just keep rotating.
[44:36.340 --> 44:38.640]  Maybe add some new shit.
[44:38.640 --> 44:42.440]  Then I just keep rotating, maybe add a product, maybe take a product out, but I really do
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.840]  try to attack those bugs with all fucking options.
[44:47.840 --> 44:50.660]  Another important part is to have boundaries and ethics.
[44:50.660 --> 44:52.840]  Don't spray shit laid into flour.
[44:52.840 --> 44:55.800]  Don't spray the wrong things in flour at all.
[44:55.800 --> 44:58.580]  Don't spray shit that you would not admit spraying.
[44:58.580 --> 45:02.440]  If you wouldn't write it down and say, hey, I sprayed 30 millimeters of this, milliliters,
[45:02.440 --> 45:05.660]  sorry, I keep saying millimeters for some reason.
[45:05.660 --> 45:09.600]  If you're not proud of it, if you wouldn't admit it, if you wouldn't smoke it with me,
[45:09.600 --> 45:10.900]  don't fucking spray it on your plants.
[45:10.900 --> 45:12.820]  That is really the ethics of all of it.
[45:12.820 --> 45:16.340]  If you wouldn't smoke it, please don't spray it.
[45:16.340 --> 45:19.540]  If you wouldn't tell us about it and be honest about it, just don't do it.
[45:19.540 --> 45:21.620]  You know, you know, and you got to feel it.
[45:21.620 --> 45:26.020]  Imagine if you spray some shit on your plants and you sell it to me or give it to me because
[45:26.020 --> 45:27.820]  you're like, bro, thank you for the lessons.
[45:27.820 --> 45:33.140]  You give me an ounce of weed and I smoke it and I start going, man, my lungs feel weird.
[45:33.140 --> 45:35.100]  Two weeks later, I'm like, my lung is all burning.
[45:35.100 --> 45:36.860]  And like a week later, I'm like, I got out of the hospital.
[45:36.860 --> 45:38.720]  My lung is fucking on fire.
[45:38.720 --> 45:42.040]  And four weeks later, like I had to pull my right lung out because I got some disease
[45:42.040 --> 45:43.040]  from a pesticide.
[45:43.040 --> 45:45.940]  And you're like, oh, that could have been from the shit that I sold him.
[45:45.940 --> 45:47.140]  Like imagine how you're going to feel.
[45:47.140 --> 45:48.780]  I don't want anybody to feel that way.
[45:48.780 --> 45:53.620]  So use some ethics when it comes to the pesticides and things you were spraying onto your plants,
[45:53.620 --> 45:57.060]  any sort of foliar product, anything you're feeding your plants, anything you're doing
[45:57.060 --> 45:59.780]  should be treated with all of that sort of ethics.
[45:59.780 --> 46:01.260]  What would Rasta Jeff do?
[46:01.260 --> 46:03.740]  Think about that as you're doing shit in your garden.
[46:03.740 --> 46:04.940]  That may be a new merch product.
[46:04.940 --> 46:08.660]  All right, I'm going to go over these notes real quick and then we may start wrapping
[46:08.660 --> 46:09.660]  up this podcast.
[46:09.660 --> 46:14.580]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[46:14.580 --> 46:20.980]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, beneficial insect users, and pesticide spray applicators,
[46:20.980 --> 46:24.060]  I want to thank you again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[46:24.060 --> 46:25.060]  podcast.
[46:25.060 --> 46:28.240]  I do want to stress that the most important part of this is that you read the bottles
[46:28.320 --> 46:34.040]  and use all of the personal protective equipment and do understand those re-entry intervals.
[46:34.040 --> 46:37.360]  Something I should add, I didn't mention on the re-entry interval part, those products
[46:37.360 --> 46:39.080]  are meant to be sprayed outdoors.
[46:39.080 --> 46:43.640]  All of those products, the re-entry interval written on those bottles is for outdoors.
[46:43.640 --> 46:46.400]  Add two to four hours if you were in an indoor environment.
[46:46.400 --> 46:51.280]  I know that sounds crazy, but they're used to having wind and sun to break down those
[46:51.280 --> 46:52.280]  products.
[46:52.280 --> 46:53.540]  You don't have that in your indoor grow.
[46:53.700 --> 46:59.980]  I would add two to four hours to your re-entry interval for your sprayed applications.
[46:59.980 --> 47:03.060]  All right, I think that is all I've got for you.
[47:03.060 --> 47:05.340]  Really, I hope you did learn a lot from this episode.
[47:05.340 --> 47:08.940]  I hope this inspired a lot of questions, corrections, comments, and concerns.
