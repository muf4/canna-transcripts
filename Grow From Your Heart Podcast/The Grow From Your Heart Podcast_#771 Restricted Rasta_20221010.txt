[00:01.080 --> 00:19.800]  All right, here we go.
[00:19.800 --> 00:21.480]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:21.480 --> 00:24.120]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:24.120 --> 00:28.840]  This is episode 771 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:28.840 --> 00:30.900]  I've got a fun show lined up for us.
[00:30.900 --> 00:34.640]  Before we get to the main topic, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks
[00:34.640 --> 00:38.020]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:38.020 --> 00:41.680]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to a new
[00:41.680 --> 00:43.880]  supporter, our friend Kyle Hines.
[00:43.880 --> 00:47.820]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to another new supporter, our friend Simeon.
[00:47.820 --> 00:52.440]  I want to send a thank you shout out to one of my favorite photographers, my buddy Root305.
[00:52.440 --> 00:54.340]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Elder's Garden.
[00:54.340 --> 00:57.300]  I also want to send a thank you shout out to Anvil Gardens.
[00:57.300 --> 01:00.620]  Let's send a big welcome back thank you shout out to my friend Thor's Trike Factory.
[01:00.620 --> 01:03.920]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to my buddy Trollin.
[01:03.920 --> 01:06.900]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Curbside Gardens.
[01:06.900 --> 01:10.280]  I want to send a thank you shout out to a Colorado local, my buddy Fish.
[01:10.280 --> 01:13.020]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Yee Motherfuckin' Ha.
[01:13.020 --> 01:16.380]  I want to send a thank you shout out to another great photographer, my buddy Mobius.
[01:16.380 --> 01:18.680]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Razzan Man.
[01:18.680 --> 01:22.480]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out
[01:22.480 --> 01:25.620]  to my buddy up north, my friend B. Bala.
[01:25.620 --> 01:30.300]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:47.740 --> 01:51.660]  it nice and easy for everybody to support the podcast.
[01:51.660 --> 01:55.220]  Speaking of Patreon, I did put out a Patreon only bonus episode.
[01:55.220 --> 01:58.060]  I ate too many edibles and I answered a few fun questions.
[01:58.060 --> 02:01.620]  I want to thank everybody on Patreon for the great response to that episode.
[02:01.620 --> 02:02.900]  I will do more like that.
[02:02.900 --> 02:06.140]  I would like to do one a month but I can't promise that at this time.
[02:06.140 --> 02:11.120]  If my production schedule and if YouTube cooperates, I will do my best to give you at least one
[02:11.120 --> 02:13.880]  of those Patreon bonus episodes every month.
[02:13.880 --> 02:14.880]  That was a good time to record.
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.740]  I can't promise you that I will eat that many edibles every time on the show.
[02:18.740 --> 02:21.020]  We will do something fun to keep it entertaining.
[02:21.020 --> 02:22.020]  So big up.
[02:22.020 --> 02:25.660]  Thank you guys for the great response to the Patreon bonus episode.
[02:25.660 --> 02:32.060]  If you haven't seen it, go check it out at patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:32.060 --> 02:36.060]  I also want to send a big thank you shout out to everybody who has grabbed an IRI Genetics
[02:36.060 --> 02:38.180]  t-shirt off of the merch store.
[02:38.180 --> 02:41.460]  Also big shout out to everybody who has pre-ordered a hoodie.
[02:41.460 --> 02:42.460]  That's right.
[02:42.460 --> 02:46.060]  On the merch store, we are offering a pre-sale for the IRI Genetics logo hoodies.
[02:46.060 --> 02:50.300]  It is a very comfortable black hoodie with the IRI cross logo on the front.
[02:50.300 --> 02:54.180]  If you go to my website, irigenetics.com, there's a link to the merch store.
[02:54.180 --> 02:56.380]  When you click on there, that will take you to the hoodies.
[02:56.380 --> 02:57.580]  You can pre-order them.
[02:57.580 --> 02:59.740]  They will ship the first of next month.
[02:59.740 --> 03:01.460]  I am currently accepting pre-orders.
[03:01.460 --> 03:04.900]  I'm going to accept those pre-orders until about halfway through the month.
[03:04.900 --> 03:06.980]  Then I will place the order for the hoodies.
[03:06.980 --> 03:10.340]  The company I work with takes about two weeks to produce the hoodies.
[03:10.340 --> 03:11.340]  They will print them.
[03:11.340 --> 03:12.340]  They will get them shipped to me.
[03:12.340 --> 03:15.620]  Then I will get them out to you as soon as possible.
[03:15.620 --> 03:19.500]  Probably the day that they arrive on my porch or the next day, I will get them right back
[03:19.500 --> 03:22.540]  out to the people who have pre-ordered those hoodies.
[03:22.540 --> 03:26.380]  So without any more rambling, please do go check out irigenetics.com.
[03:26.380 --> 03:30.580]  Click on the merch tab, pre-order a hoodie, grab a shirt that is in stock now.
[03:30.700 --> 03:33.180]  I look forward to filling your order.
[03:33.180 --> 03:34.580]  What else do I want to talk about?
[03:34.580 --> 03:36.820]  I got to harvest part of the greenhouse.
[03:36.820 --> 03:41.140]  If you've been following along, you know that I've been breeding in a greenhouse this year.
[03:41.140 --> 03:42.140]  That's right.
[03:42.140 --> 03:43.140]  We've got a greenhouse.
[03:43.140 --> 03:44.140]  We do not talk about the location.
[03:44.140 --> 03:45.140]  Nobody knows a lot about it.
[03:45.140 --> 03:48.460]  Try to keep it secretive because that's just shit that I've learned along the way.
[03:48.460 --> 03:51.980]  Anyway, I'm ready to tell you about it now because it has been harvested.
[03:51.980 --> 03:52.980]  The plants are down.
[03:52.980 --> 03:53.980]  They are in bins.
[03:53.980 --> 03:54.980]  They are drying.
[03:54.980 --> 03:55.980]  They are secure.
[03:55.980 --> 03:58.720]  So now that those plants have been harvested, they are in a secure place, I do feel much
[03:58.800 --> 04:01.040]  more comfortable talking about them.
[04:01.040 --> 04:04.320]  Let's talk a little bit about what we bred this summer.
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.400]  I did use a Jack the Ripper male.
[04:06.400 --> 04:10.400]  I'm sure if you've been following along, you know that I do have a Jack the Ripper male
[04:10.400 --> 04:12.960]  that I really enjoy the way that he works.
[04:12.960 --> 04:16.420]  I'm very fond of the outcome that comes from that Jack the Ripper male.
[04:16.420 --> 04:18.280]  He made the blueberry butcher.
[04:18.280 --> 04:19.320]  He made the convergence.
[04:19.320 --> 04:21.360]  He made the Jack the Ripper F2s.
[04:21.360 --> 04:22.600]  He's made a lot of great things.
[04:22.600 --> 04:24.200]  He made the dog ripper.
[04:24.200 --> 04:26.180]  There's a lot of great stuff coming from him.
[04:26.180 --> 04:31.100]  So I took that Jack the Ripper male and I put him outside and I pollinated 10 females
[04:31.100 --> 04:33.180]  in Colorado in a grow space here.
[04:33.180 --> 04:35.360]  You are allowed up to 12 plants in most areas.
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.260]  If you have six of your recreational plants, six medical plants, that's your limit.
[04:39.260 --> 04:41.060]  We put 12 plants outdoors.
[04:41.060 --> 04:45.260]  I put two clones of the Jack the Ripper male out there, the same male, just two copies
[04:45.260 --> 04:47.340]  of him to make sure to get plenty of pollen.
[04:47.340 --> 04:49.820]  Then we put 10 female plants out there.
[04:49.820 --> 04:53.500]  We pollinated all 10 of them very thoroughly.
[04:53.500 --> 04:55.540]  Let's talk a little bit about the plants that were out there.
[04:55.900 --> 04:57.420]  I've got to leave some to the imagination.
[04:57.420 --> 05:00.700]  I did make more blueberry butcher seeds out there.
[05:00.700 --> 05:03.500]  So there will be more blueberry butcher seeds coming very soon.
[05:03.500 --> 05:05.540]  Those were made in the greenhouse this year.
[05:05.540 --> 05:13.540]  I did cross the Congo, the Roberts Creek Congo, the Vision Maker Congo has been pollinated
[05:13.540 --> 05:15.140]  by the Jack the Ripper.
[05:15.140 --> 05:22.220]  That should make some extremely potent, really sativa dominant head buzz, kind of paranoia,
[05:22.220 --> 05:25.340]  panic attack, euphoric, talk too much kind of weed.
[05:25.340 --> 05:27.260]  That's really what I expect from that.
[05:27.260 --> 05:30.980]  The Congo did not like being outdoors or in the greenhouse in Colorado.
[05:30.980 --> 05:33.300]  It did not react as well as it does indoors.
[05:33.300 --> 05:36.820]  Indoors, that plant gets taller than everybody super quickly.
[05:36.820 --> 05:38.600]  It's a monstrous plant.
[05:38.600 --> 05:40.700]  When I put it outdoors, it kind of stalled out.
[05:40.700 --> 05:44.580]  It was like, nah, I don't think I'm going to grow like I normally do, which was disappointing.
[05:44.580 --> 05:46.420]  But we still got plenty of seeds from that one.
[05:46.420 --> 05:49.700]  There are a lot of seeds to play with, a lot of seeds to sift through.
[05:49.700 --> 05:51.460]  You guys will have fun with that.
[05:51.460 --> 05:55.700]  Also I pollinated, once again, I made more of the Platinum Tangy to Jack the Ripper.
[05:55.700 --> 05:56.820]  I made that a little bit ago.
[05:56.820 --> 05:59.820]  We made a very small plant to play with, ran a few testers.
[05:59.820 --> 06:01.500]  We saw great success with that.
[06:01.500 --> 06:05.100]  So I did make a whole batch of Platinum Tangy to Jack the Ripper.
[06:05.100 --> 06:09.500]  I also had a Golden Goat pollinated by Jack the Ripper and that Golden Goat produced a
[06:09.500 --> 06:11.260]  lot of seeds.
[06:11.260 --> 06:14.540]  That Golden Goat plant did amazingly well outdoors.
[06:14.540 --> 06:18.940]  The Platinum Tangy and the Golden Goat both did very, very well outdoors.
[06:18.940 --> 06:21.780]  I made more Jack the Ripper F2 seeds.
[06:21.780 --> 06:24.100]  I'm not sure how much else I want to tell you about.
[06:24.100 --> 06:27.500]  I pollinated the P91 with Jack the Ripper.
[06:27.500 --> 06:29.180]  That's all we're going to talk about for now.
[06:29.180 --> 06:32.420]  But I made a bunch of great stuff with the Jack the Ripper outdoors.
[06:32.420 --> 06:33.940]  The plants are cut down.
[06:33.940 --> 06:37.920]  It takes about, depending on the environment, the room, and honestly how often I get to
[06:37.920 --> 06:41.860]  mess with it, it takes about 10 to 14 days for those plants to dry.
[06:41.860 --> 06:44.540]  I let them dry really, really dry.
[06:44.540 --> 06:48.840]  Once they're super bone dry and crispy, I'll remove all the stems and then I'll start crushing
[06:48.840 --> 06:52.880]  it up with my hands and gloves and just crunching it up into basically a fine dust.
[06:52.880 --> 06:55.880]  It looks like you're just going to roll a big old fatty or a bunch of blunts.
[06:55.880 --> 07:00.900]  I've got an entire eight foot tall plant worth of material just in a bin and I just crush
[07:00.900 --> 07:03.040]  it up until it's dust with my gloves.
[07:03.040 --> 07:07.000]  And then I've got a machine that I pour that material into and it actually separates the
[07:07.000 --> 07:08.880]  material and the seeds.
[07:08.880 --> 07:13.640]  So I need about 10 to 14 days to get it dry, a day or two to get it all crushed up, and
[07:13.640 --> 07:14.640]  then a day or two.
[07:14.640 --> 07:15.800]  It takes me a while to run all these plants.
[07:15.800 --> 07:19.560]  It's a lot of material and a lot of plants to work through, to run that all through the
[07:19.560 --> 07:20.560]  separator.
[07:20.560 --> 07:22.920]  Then it's got to go all through the counter.
[07:22.920 --> 07:25.220]  Then it's all got to go out to testers.
[07:25.220 --> 07:27.720]  So it's going to be a little bit before a lot of this is available.
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.400]  I'm sure right now my tester inbox is going to start blowing up.
[07:31.400 --> 07:32.400]  Send them to me, you guys.
[07:32.400 --> 07:35.440]  If you know how to contact me about a tester, if you're interested in testing, send me a
[07:35.440 --> 07:36.440]  message.
[07:36.440 --> 07:38.320]  Include pictures of your grow and your address when you do that.
[07:38.320 --> 07:40.360]  It just makes it so much easier.
[07:40.360 --> 07:42.360]  Send me all your testing information.
[07:42.360 --> 07:45.160]  If you want to test the new shit that came out of the greenhouse, a lot of it will get
[07:45.520 --> 07:48.080]  put in as freebies and upcoming orders also.
[07:48.080 --> 07:51.760]  So that is my fall harvest report for 2022.
[07:51.760 --> 07:53.880]  I feel like it was a great success.
[07:53.880 --> 07:56.800]  We've got a lot of seeds, a lot of great crosses.
[07:56.800 --> 07:59.620]  Big shout out to the people who helped me out with the greenhouse space, the people
[07:59.620 --> 08:02.560]  that were out there early in the morning, sometimes late at night.
[08:02.560 --> 08:05.520]  Big shout out to the person that had to hang a light they did not expect to hang in a high
[08:05.520 --> 08:08.800]  space in a precarious position.
[08:08.800 --> 08:09.800]  Big up.
[08:09.800 --> 08:10.800]  You guys did a great job.
[08:10.800 --> 08:11.800]  We did a great job.
[08:11.800 --> 08:12.800]  We're going to have a great year.
[08:12.800 --> 08:13.800]  All right.
[08:13.800 --> 08:15.040]  I do have more stuff to talk about.
[08:15.920 --> 08:19.680]  You may have noticed that my content was a little bit weird on the last couple of episodes.
[08:19.680 --> 08:22.400]  I'm trying to tread lightly.
[08:22.400 --> 08:25.120]  YouTube is on, they're basically on the rampage.
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.760]  They're shutting down a lot of the cannabis content, the educators that are out here talking
[08:29.760 --> 08:30.840]  about the plant.
[08:30.840 --> 08:34.080]  The Dude Grow Show has been completely shut down.
[08:34.080 --> 08:35.920]  Newbie Nugs' page is completely gone.
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.440]  A few of our other friends have lost their YouTube pages simply for posting cannabis,
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.880]  talking about supporting, condoning, and educating about our favorite plant or at least my favorite
[08:44.920 --> 08:45.920]  plant.
[08:45.920 --> 08:47.600]  I'm sure it's probably most of our favorite plant.
[08:47.600 --> 08:49.640]  Big shout out to you, Monstera nerds.
[08:49.640 --> 08:52.760]  But YouTube has been on the rampage, taking down content.
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.480]  I've been trying to tread lightly because I have gotten a couple of YouTube strikes.
[08:57.480 --> 09:00.920]  First they gave me a warning, then they gave me another strike and they said, you can't
[09:00.920 --> 09:02.480]  post for five days.
[09:02.480 --> 09:06.360]  And then they said, if you get one more strike this month, we will take down your channel.
[09:06.360 --> 09:10.520]  So I tried to not post for the rest of that month so that I did not get more strikes on
[09:10.520 --> 09:11.800]  fresh content.
[09:11.800 --> 09:14.200]  The problem is that they are striking old content.
[09:14.240 --> 09:20.360]  I've got 770 episodes before this episode and they keep finding problems with old content
[09:20.360 --> 09:23.200]  like in the hundreds, like 100, 200, 300.
[09:23.200 --> 09:28.800]  They're finding just random episodes, flagging it, giving me community violations for that.
[09:28.800 --> 09:33.760]  For some reason, my content has been deemed harmful and or dangerous, which I don't understand
[09:33.760 --> 09:38.000]  because I'm just sitting here talking and unless my voice is that powerful that I'm
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.720]  sparking some sort of revolution, we are not harmful or dangerous.
[09:41.720 --> 09:46.560]  I'm teaching people how to help themselves with a medical product to ease and improve
[09:46.560 --> 09:48.680]  the quality of their life.
[09:48.680 --> 09:54.480]  We can look at, we can see half naked women, we can see beer ads and boner pills all day,
[09:54.480 --> 09:58.960]  but if you try to promote the plant that we love, that's harmful and dangerous.
[09:58.960 --> 10:01.320]  I understand it, but I don't agree with it.
[10:01.320 --> 10:02.400]  Let's talk about this a little bit.
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.000]  I've got a nice little rant that I'm going to just skip my notes here, going to leave
[10:07.000 --> 10:09.880]  a note where I am and then, all right, here we go.
[10:09.880 --> 10:10.880]  I understand this.
[10:11.040 --> 10:14.320]  I've got a little rant that I've kind of half done on a couple of other podcasts, but I
[10:14.320 --> 10:16.920]  wanted to save the big part for this show.
[10:16.920 --> 10:19.700]  Here is what I feel is going on with YouTube.
[10:19.700 --> 10:23.600]  First of all, let me say I understand it, but I do not agree with it.
[10:23.600 --> 10:25.340]  Here is what I feel is happening with YouTube.
[10:25.340 --> 10:27.600]  This is just my take on it.
[10:27.600 --> 10:30.880]  I didn't do any research, so I don't have an actual number.
[10:30.880 --> 10:34.080]  YouTube is a billion dollar company, right?
[10:34.080 --> 10:38.120]  Definitely a multi-million, possibly a multi-billion dollar company.
[10:38.120 --> 10:39.120]  They do a lot of revenue.
[10:39.120 --> 10:40.920]  They feed a lot of people.
[10:40.920 --> 10:45.120]  They have a lot of income, a lot of interaction, a lot of support with the entire world.
[10:45.120 --> 10:47.980]  Everybody on the planet knows what YouTube is.
[10:47.980 --> 10:49.720]  Everybody has seen a YouTube video.
[10:49.720 --> 10:50.960]  That's where I learn a lot of things.
[10:50.960 --> 10:52.520]  That's where I teach a lot of things.
[10:52.520 --> 10:53.920]  We all know YouTube.
[10:53.920 --> 10:54.920]  YouTube is present.
[10:54.920 --> 10:55.920]  YouTube is popular.
[10:55.920 --> 10:57.220]  They've got a lot of money.
[10:57.220 --> 11:01.200]  The people that own and work at YouTube like having a lot of money.
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.640]  They like knowing that paycheck is coming in every month.
[11:04.640 --> 11:07.560]  Let's talk about why they are messing with cannabis content.
[11:07.560 --> 11:10.440]  A lot of people say it's legal in Colorado.
[11:10.440 --> 11:11.440]  It's legal in California.
[11:11.440 --> 11:16.700]  Yes, but it's not legal in some other places.
[11:16.700 --> 11:21.200]  What would happen, and I don't agree with this, but I'm just speaking on general why
[11:21.200 --> 11:22.580]  I feel like this is happening.
[11:22.580 --> 11:26.520]  This is just my understanding to make sort of an explanation of this.
[11:26.520 --> 11:27.520]  They make a lot of money.
[11:27.520 --> 11:32.700]  They don't want to get involved in any sort of legal battle, a court case, anything that
[11:32.700 --> 11:36.800]  would tarnish their income, anything that would tarnish their reputation, anything that
[11:36.800 --> 11:39.480]  would tarnish their revenue stream.
[11:39.480 --> 11:42.720]  Hypothetically, this could work this way.
[11:42.720 --> 11:47.720]  If somebody were to learn something illegal off of YouTube and they practiced that illegal
[11:47.720 --> 11:52.880]  practice and got in trouble for it, and they said, I learned it on YouTube, guess who could
[11:52.880 --> 11:55.400]  be involved in, be part of it?
[11:55.400 --> 11:56.400]  They could be an accessory.
[11:56.400 --> 12:00.760]  They could be implemented in that crime because that person may not have committed that crime
[12:00.760 --> 12:02.400]  without the help of YouTube.
[12:02.400 --> 12:03.960]  YouTube doesn't want that.
[12:03.960 --> 12:05.440]  YouTube doesn't want to go to court.
[12:05.680 --> 12:07.320]  YouTube doesn't want the press for that.
[12:07.320 --> 12:08.880]  YouTube doesn't want to be involved in that.
[12:08.880 --> 12:11.320]  I can't speak for YouTube, but I am a company owner.
[12:11.320 --> 12:12.480]  I have a company.
[12:12.480 --> 12:15.120]  I've got a Discord server.
[12:15.120 --> 12:16.760]  I believe in free speech.
[12:16.760 --> 12:20.680]  I definitely believe that we should be able to say what we want to say.
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.960]  I also believe that there will be repercussions and consequences for what I say.
[12:25.960 --> 12:29.860]  If I say something completely terrible to somebody, I wouldn't be too surprised if they
[12:29.860 --> 12:31.800]  punched me right in the fucking mouth.
[12:31.800 --> 12:32.800]  That's how life goes.
[12:32.800 --> 12:37.840]  We've got freedom of speech, but we've also got expectation of consequences, responsibility
[12:37.840 --> 12:39.500]  of words and action.
[12:39.500 --> 12:41.040]  That is part of being a human.
[12:41.040 --> 12:42.360]  Let me get myself back on track here.
[12:42.360 --> 12:44.420]  I do believe in freedom of speech.
[12:44.420 --> 12:50.840]  You cannot go to my Discord server and start dropping racial or homophobic, or you can't
[12:50.840 --> 12:55.360]  come in and talk, you can't talk about terroristic activities on my Discord server.
[12:55.360 --> 13:00.660]  I will not allow that because that is very off-brand for what I support.
[13:00.660 --> 13:04.060]  You can come in my Discord server and we'll talk about cannabis, we'll talk about reggae
[13:04.060 --> 13:08.180]  music, we'll talk about life, love, all the good shit, but we're not going to do anything
[13:08.180 --> 13:09.180]  negative.
[13:09.180 --> 13:10.600]  We're not going to hurt anybody's feelings.
[13:10.600 --> 13:12.180]  We're not going to attack anybody.
[13:12.180 --> 13:15.380]  If you do that sort of shit in my Discord, I will shut you down immediately.
[13:15.380 --> 13:17.840]  I'll warn you one time based on what you say.
[13:17.840 --> 13:21.860]  If you're dropping N-bombs and F-bombs in there, you know the F-bomb I'm talking about,
[13:21.860 --> 13:23.260]  you can't say those words in there.
[13:23.260 --> 13:24.940]  Maybe even the R-word in the wrong way.
[13:24.940 --> 13:27.320]  I'm going to say something like, hey bro, you can't do that here.
[13:27.320 --> 13:29.880]  If you do it another time, we're just going to block you forever.
[13:29.880 --> 13:30.880]  We're not even going to remember you.
[13:30.880 --> 13:31.880]  You're gone.
[13:31.880 --> 13:36.120]  I do that because I'm supporting a community that I want to be a positive community.
[13:36.120 --> 13:37.320]  I don't want hatred there.
[13:37.320 --> 13:39.520]  I want it to support my brand.
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.880]  It's got my face on it, my company name on it.
[13:41.880 --> 13:46.120]  I don't need the N-word, the F-word, and the R-word involved in my community and my company
[13:46.120 --> 13:47.120]  at all.
[13:47.120 --> 13:48.120]  I don't support that.
[13:48.120 --> 13:49.120]  Don't condone that.
[13:49.120 --> 13:50.120]  It's not what I'm here for.
[13:50.120 --> 13:51.840]  If you're going to say that, you're not part of our team.
[13:51.840 --> 13:55.160]  You're not here for what we're trying to do and you should go play over there.
[13:55.160 --> 13:56.600]  When you get your shit figured out, come back.
[13:56.600 --> 13:59.600]  We may let you hang out, but when you're acting like that, we don't want you around.
[14:00.320 --> 14:02.560]  On my server, I do practice censorship.
[14:02.560 --> 14:05.040]  It is because I don't want bullshit.
[14:05.040 --> 14:06.520]  I don't want terroristic activities.
[14:06.520 --> 14:07.520]  I don't want racism.
[14:07.520 --> 14:10.520]  I don't want homophobia on my Discord server.
[14:10.520 --> 14:12.560]  I barely make any money compared to YouTube.
[14:12.560 --> 14:17.320]  I've got a business that does generate revenue, but compared to YouTube, I am nobody.
[14:17.320 --> 14:19.560]  I've got 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[14:19.560 --> 14:23.080]  YouTube's got however many people watch all day, every day.
[14:23.080 --> 14:27.720]  Imagine the money that YouTube is bringing in and imagine why they don't want to give
[14:27.720 --> 14:32.320]  any of that to court, law enforcement, or anything like that.
[14:32.320 --> 14:36.880]  Think about, this really does sound crazy, but think about if two people are in an alley
[14:36.880 --> 14:38.920]  and one person says, hey, can you find drugs?
[14:38.920 --> 14:43.180]  The other guy says, I don't have drugs, but person number three has drugs.
[14:43.180 --> 14:47.680]  If one of those persons gets caught selling or buying or carrying those drugs and it goes
[14:47.680 --> 14:51.520]  down wrong, all three of those people are going to jail for that drug transaction because
[14:51.520 --> 14:54.720]  person two facilitated that transaction.
[14:54.720 --> 14:56.580]  YouTube doesn't want to be person two.
[14:56.580 --> 14:57.700]  That is basically what's happening.
[14:57.700 --> 15:01.300]  I'm trying to be careful with what I say here because here's where I'm headed to this.
[15:01.300 --> 15:05.140]  I don't want to lose my YouTube channel for saying something stupid.
[15:05.140 --> 15:08.900]  I'm probably risking a lot by talking about YouTube and censorship the way that I am right
[15:08.900 --> 15:12.860]  now, but that's part of my job is to fucking speak up.
[15:12.860 --> 15:14.020]  I'm Ganja Soldier.
[15:14.020 --> 15:15.220]  I've been here doing this for so long.
[15:15.220 --> 15:17.300]  I've been doing this since before cannabis was legal.
[15:17.300 --> 15:19.820]  I'm not brand new at this.
[15:19.820 --> 15:23.140]  People get mad that our YouTube channels get taken down, our Instagram accounts get shut
[15:23.140 --> 15:24.140]  down.
[15:24.140 --> 15:29.980]  I remember one day, they drove a tank up my front yard, tied a chain to my front door,
[15:29.980 --> 15:31.620]  pulled the front door off my fucking house.
[15:31.620 --> 15:33.380]  My dogs went running down the street.
[15:33.380 --> 15:34.380]  12 cops came in.
[15:34.380 --> 15:36.420]  A flashbang went off.
[15:36.420 --> 15:37.840]  Everybody dives on the floor.
[15:37.840 --> 15:39.780]  They cut open every couch cushion.
[15:39.780 --> 15:41.140]  They cut open every pillow.
[15:41.140 --> 15:42.420]  They cut open the mattresses.
[15:42.420 --> 15:44.180]  They cut open the speakers.
[15:44.180 --> 15:46.500]  They dumped all of our food on the floor.
[15:46.500 --> 15:50.380]  They didn't find shit, but they swore there was something in there that they needed and
[15:50.380 --> 15:55.220]  they were not stopping digging and destroying my house until they found that shit.
[15:55.220 --> 15:59.740]  So nowadays, when they take away my Discord or my YouTube channel, it goes, that fucking
[15:59.740 --> 16:03.020]  sucks, but they didn't fucking pour all my food on my kitchen floor.
[16:03.020 --> 16:04.300]  They didn't tear my front door off.
[16:04.300 --> 16:07.820]  I don't have to rebuild my life and find somewhere new to live because once that shit happens,
[16:07.820 --> 16:08.820]  the landlord kicks you out.
[16:08.820 --> 16:10.660]  You don't get to fucking live there anymore and it's so embarrassing.
[16:10.660 --> 16:14.380]  You don't want to live there anymore anyway, but that shit doesn't, that's not happening
[16:14.380 --> 16:16.820]  because we live in a legal place.
[16:16.820 --> 16:20.380]  But yeah, I'm okay with losing my Instagram.
[16:20.380 --> 16:22.180]  I'm okay with losing my YouTube.
[16:22.180 --> 16:25.920]  Knock on wood, I don't want to lose them, but there are other options, other places
[16:25.920 --> 16:27.980]  to go if stuff like that does happen.
[16:27.980 --> 16:30.340]  I'm going to find other places to upload the videos.
[16:30.340 --> 16:33.980]  I've been told that Cannabuzz does support podcast videos.
[16:33.980 --> 16:36.380]  Soon, I will be posting my videos to Cannabuzz.
[16:36.380 --> 16:38.220]  It takes a long time to upload those videos.
[16:38.220 --> 16:39.620]  You guys be patient with me.
[16:39.620 --> 16:44.140]  I'm also going to try Vimeo and there was another service, I think it's called Rumble.
[16:44.140 --> 16:45.780]  I'm also going to try those.
[16:45.940 --> 16:47.420]  I disappear on YouTube.
[16:47.420 --> 16:51.900]  Look for me on Vimeo, Rumble, and also on Cannabuzz.
[16:51.900 --> 16:55.220]  The audio platform will always remain because the RSS feeds are cool.
[16:55.220 --> 16:58.140]  They don't even censor very much on those platforms.
[16:58.140 --> 17:00.780]  All right, let me get back on track.
[17:00.780 --> 17:04.260]  I look forward to legalization so that we don't have to be censored.
[17:04.260 --> 17:08.740]  I look forward to all of the entire nation legalizing cannabis so that I can teach everybody
[17:08.740 --> 17:14.420]  without fear of my show, my hard work, my dedication, part of my income being hindered
[17:14.540 --> 17:16.940]  because YouTube has some silly rules.
[17:16.940 --> 17:19.420]  I get it, but I do not agree, YouTube.
[17:19.420 --> 17:22.100]  All right, now what I want from you, what I need from you is I need help.
[17:22.100 --> 17:25.060]  Where do I go if they do take me down on YouTube?
[17:25.060 --> 17:26.100]  I did mention Rumble.
[17:26.100 --> 17:27.580]  I mentioned Vimeo.
[17:27.580 --> 17:28.820]  I mentioned Cannabuzz.
[17:28.820 --> 17:31.820]  Where are all the cool kids going to watch videos?
[17:31.820 --> 17:33.780]  Where are you going for cannabis content?
[17:33.780 --> 17:36.180]  What websites, what applications are you using?
[17:36.180 --> 17:40.460]  I feel like I'm a little bit out of the loop because I'm so busy creating content and trying
[17:40.460 --> 17:44.020]  to get it out that I don't really have time to go discover the new platform.
[17:44.100 --> 17:48.420]  If you've got a recommendation, a suggestion where I can put the show, where I can participate
[17:48.420 --> 17:52.500]  with the cannabis community, I would love to join you wherever the cool kids are.
[17:52.500 --> 17:53.900]  I'll follow you there.
[17:53.900 --> 17:54.900]  Help me out.
[17:54.900 --> 17:55.900]  All right, let me check on my notes.
[17:55.900 --> 17:56.900]  I've got more.
[17:56.900 --> 18:02.100]  Also, I want to know what magazines and cannabis content you are consuming your other cannabis
[18:02.100 --> 18:03.100]  education in.
[18:03.100 --> 18:05.180]  Maybe not videos, but what else are you checking out?
[18:05.180 --> 18:10.140]  I need some new cannabis education, cannabis content for myself to consume.
[18:10.140 --> 18:11.140]  Fill me in.
[18:11.140 --> 18:12.140]  Where do we go for that?
[18:12.260 --> 18:13.260]  I'm here to support you guys.
[18:13.260 --> 18:17.180]  If they do shut me down on any, every platform, keep rest assured.
[18:17.180 --> 18:18.340]  I am not going anywhere.
[18:18.340 --> 18:19.500]  I will not give up.
[18:19.500 --> 18:22.740]  I'm here to support cannabis, to teach you guys how to grow cannabis.
[18:22.740 --> 18:25.180]  I'm here to breed the best seeds that I can offer you.
[18:25.180 --> 18:26.260]  I'm not going anywhere.
[18:26.260 --> 18:30.860]  Even if YouTube shuts me down, if YouTube, Vimeo, Rumble, Cannabuzz, if they all shut
[18:30.860 --> 18:33.060]  me down, bro, we'll invent our own shit.
[18:33.060 --> 18:34.220]  We'll come back stronger than ever.
[18:34.220 --> 18:35.260]  You can't stop us.
[18:35.260 --> 18:36.940]  Can't stop, won't stop.
[18:36.940 --> 18:38.820]  Viva la revolution.
[18:38.820 --> 18:39.820]  Cannabis can't be stopped, bro.
[18:39.820 --> 18:42.020]  We're legalizing everywhere.
[18:42.020 --> 18:45.540]  If we do disappear, it's only going to be temporary because you know that as soon as
[18:45.540 --> 18:48.140]  they do legalize cannabis, they're going to let all of us come back and play.
[18:48.140 --> 18:50.540]  But the question is, do we want to come back then?
[18:50.540 --> 18:53.380]  If they shut us all down, do we even want to come back to YouTube?
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.380]  All right.
[18:54.380 --> 18:56.580]  I think I've rambled on long enough about this topic.
[18:56.580 --> 19:00.300]  I don't even know if this episode will get to stay up because of YouTube's scrutiny at
[19:00.300 --> 19:01.380]  this time.
[19:01.380 --> 19:02.380]  Please don't give up on me.
[19:02.380 --> 19:03.660]  I'm going to keep making episodes.
[19:03.660 --> 19:05.240]  I'll find some more to put them.
[19:05.240 --> 19:06.240]  Keep hanging out.
[19:06.240 --> 19:08.180]  Keep clicking like on the videos.
[19:08.180 --> 19:09.460]  Keep sending me all the comments.
[19:09.460 --> 19:10.460]  Comment right down there.
[19:10.460 --> 19:12.460]  The comment section is crazy lately, you guys.
[19:12.460 --> 19:13.460]  Don't give up.
[19:13.460 --> 19:14.460]  Keep doing that.
[19:14.460 --> 19:15.460]  I love reading the comments.
[19:15.460 --> 19:18.740]  I don't answer all of them, but I do read 90% of them.
[19:18.740 --> 19:19.740]  Most of you people are amazing.
[19:19.740 --> 19:22.140]  A couple of percent of you are not so cool.
[19:22.140 --> 19:23.140]  All right, you guys.
[19:23.140 --> 19:26.780]  The next episode, I do plan on talking about pheno hunting and selecting the phenotype
[19:26.780 --> 19:28.660]  for you and your garden.
[19:28.660 --> 19:30.840]  That should be the next episode.
[19:30.840 --> 19:32.340]  That is all I've got for today's episode.
[19:32.340 --> 19:33.860]  I want to thank you once again for hanging out.
[19:33.860 --> 19:35.980]  I did have a good time on this podcast.
[19:35.980 --> 19:39.060]  Didn't talk too much about cannabis, but I did get to rant and ramble a little bit,
[19:39.060 --> 19:41.260]  and that always feels good to me.
[19:41.260 --> 19:46.240]  If you enjoyed this rant and ramble, I do invite you to join my Instagram because every
[19:46.240 --> 19:52.940]  Monday night around 7.10 PM Colorado time, mountain time, so it's 7.10 in the mountain
[19:52.940 --> 19:55.500]  time zone, I go on Instagram Live.
[19:55.500 --> 19:57.980]  I'm iree underscore genetics on Instagram.
[19:57.980 --> 20:02.580]  I-R-I-E underscore genetics, ieree genetics on Instagram.
[20:02.580 --> 20:08.380]  Follow that account every Monday around 7.10, sometimes 7.15-ish PM mountain time once again.
[20:08.380 --> 20:13.660]  I go live and I hang out, I smoke some dabs, I drink a bunch of kombucha, and I answer
[20:13.660 --> 20:17.500]  cannabis cultivation and cannabis culture questions on the fly.
[20:17.500 --> 20:21.580]  You guys can ask me almost anything you want, and I will try to answer every question that
[20:21.580 --> 20:22.820]  comes through that live feed.
[20:22.820 --> 20:24.280]  It's a lot of fun for me.
[20:24.280 --> 20:25.460]  It keeps me on my toes.
[20:25.460 --> 20:27.220]  It keeps you guys entertained.
[20:27.220 --> 20:30.980]  Also it keeps my brain sparking and gives me ideas and input for the podcast.
[20:30.980 --> 20:34.340]  It inspires me to write shit down and put it here on the show.
[20:34.340 --> 20:37.460]  So check out the Instagram live, ieree underscore genetics.

[20:42.860 --> 20:44.220]  I just pop in and say, hey, what's up guys?
[20:44.220 --> 20:45.220]  I'm taking a dab.
[20:45.220 --> 20:46.220]  I got about a minute.
[20:46.220 --> 20:49.100]  Hang out, take a dab, answer a question, and get out, go about with my day.
[20:49.100 --> 20:50.100]  It's a lot of fun.
[20:50.100 --> 20:51.100]  Join me.
