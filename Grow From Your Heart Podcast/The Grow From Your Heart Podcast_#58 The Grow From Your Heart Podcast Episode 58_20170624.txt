[00:10.040 --> 00:21.920]  You gotta turn on the mics, huh? That might help.
[00:21.920 --> 00:25.000]  Jeez. What's up, everybody? It's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.520]  podcast. It's time for episode number 58. Man, I hope you guys are as dabbed out as
[00:29.520 --> 00:33.280]  we are. I'm not even gonna do the big ol' long intro. Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[00:33.280 --> 00:37.900]  I do have to give a big shout out to Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band. We are high
[00:37.900 --> 00:42.440]  as shit. Speaking of we, what's up, Spence? What up, what up? Joining me across the table
[00:42.440 --> 00:46.400]  is my buddy Garden of Weeden. He showed up with a mothership rig and a pelican case.
[00:46.400 --> 00:50.880]  I knew we were gonna get wrecked as soon as he walked in. Let's do one quick ad and then
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.320]  we're gonna get to this show. This organic portions of this podcast were brought to you
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.520]  by my good friends at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company. Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[00:58.520 --> 01:02.040]  in Colorado Springs for fresh worm castings, African night crawlers, red wigglers, and
[01:02.040 --> 01:05.920]  all of your organic soil amendments. The Rocky Mountain Worm Company has Dragonfly Earth
[01:05.920 --> 01:09.960]  Medicine products in stock now. You can get the same worm castings that I use, the same
[01:09.960 --> 01:13.440]  casting that Spence uses, the same casting that Sean and Jesse use. You can get them
[01:13.440 --> 01:19.080]  all through www.rockymountainwormcompany.com or if you're in Colorado, visit them at 411
[01:19.080 --> 01:24.280]  Tijuana Street in Colorado Springs. Tijuana. Hey, it's the shit, literally. That is the
[01:24.280 --> 01:28.560]  shit. I turned down the music here. It's loud in my head. Always, this podcast is brought
[01:28.560 --> 01:32.360]  to you by Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies. Shout out to Jesse. Shout out to Bern. Also, big
[01:32.360 --> 01:35.680]  shout out to Spence, dude. Thanks for coming to the growers meeting the other night. For
[01:35.680 --> 01:39.200]  sure. That kinda got chaotic. It wasn't much of a grow lesson. We just smoked too much
[01:39.200 --> 01:41.680]  weed. We all smoked too much weed. We had a good time. We gotta be focused sometimes.
[01:41.680 --> 01:47.760]  We should get a board. I'm gonna prepare something next time so that it's not just a bunch of
[01:47.760 --> 01:53.160]  smoking. Let's do a question box. There you go. Everybody has to do a question to have.
[01:53.160 --> 01:56.720]  That's a good idea. You can just pick it out and we'll try to answer whatever questions
[01:56.720 --> 02:00.000]  people have. Guys, if you listen to the show and you come to the growers meetings, all
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.360]  you gotta do is email me or tweet me and I will base my next lesson for the growers meeting
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.960]  around some of your questions also. We'll do that. Shout out to Hygro Indoor Growing
[02:08.960 --> 02:14.560]  Supplies. They have a Denver location, 6271 Beach Street. Also, 618 East 4th Street in
[02:14.560 --> 02:18.400]  beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. The next time you shop at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies,
[02:18.400 --> 02:21.640]  tell them you listened to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and you will get commercial
[02:21.640 --> 02:26.440]  pricing on your entire order. That's fucking super sweet, super fat deal. Everybody wants
[02:26.440 --> 02:29.640]  to save some money. Spence, you had something to say. Go for it, bro.
[02:29.640 --> 02:35.200]  I just tried to take a selfie that said episode 58 and there's a dab right over my camera
[02:35.200 --> 02:42.120]  to where you ate this gold. It's all cloudy. That is good. Dab life for sure. You know
[02:42.120 --> 02:45.160]  you're a dabber if your phone is sticky and has dabs on it. If you go to pick up your
[02:45.160 --> 02:49.000]  car keys and there's half a dab stuck to it. I had a dab in my beard the other morning
[02:49.000 --> 02:52.240]  when I woke up and I don't know what the hell happened there. Dab life. You got to give
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.640]  a shout out to the dabs. What's up with you taking selfies on the show? That's OG right
[02:56.640 --> 03:00.920]  there. OG triple, triple. Big shout out to the sponsors. I did quick ads because Spence
[03:00.920 --> 03:04.040]  is here and we're high and I just want to get to the conversation. I don't want to ramble
[03:04.040 --> 03:06.840]  about commercials. You guys don't want to hear a lot of commercials, but if you guys
[03:06.840 --> 03:10.440]  are interested in sponsoring the show, send me an email. It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[03:10.440 --> 03:15.960]  I'll get you all of that info. Spence texted me the other day. He's like, let's do a podcast
[03:15.960 --> 03:21.680]  dog. I said, what do you want to talk about? He said, canopy management. We're going to
[03:21.680 --> 03:25.440]  jump right into it. That was a good three minute intro. I like it. I like it. No rambles,
[03:25.440 --> 03:30.760]  no bullshit. Canopy management. I've been watching Spence follow a guy named Greenworks
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.360]  on Instagram. So a lot of this will be inspired by our buddy Greenworks. Big shout out. Shout
[03:34.360 --> 03:38.840]  out to the homie. Shout out to the homie. I choked when I said that. I guess I'm not
[03:38.840 --> 03:43.760]  allowed to say that. That was odd, man. So yeah, shout out to Greenworks. He kind of
[03:43.760 --> 03:50.280]  inspired Spence to set up some really killer cage-like, not really cages. The cage is only
[03:50.280 --> 03:53.440]  on top. Do you want to explain how you did it or do you want me to keep rambling for
[03:53.440 --> 03:57.000]  you? All right. So it's essentially a single plant
[03:57.000 --> 04:05.160]  grog to where you have, we use bigger pots. Greenworks uses 27s. I'm pretty sure something
[04:05.160 --> 04:09.920]  like that. I use right around 20s. So that's a 20 gallon pot. I've seen them and they look
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.280]  pretty big. They're about 22 inches around, 18 inches tall. They're huge. Maybe even more
[04:15.280 --> 04:20.400]  than 18, maybe about 24 inches tall. Which the plants, oh yeah, the pots are two foot
[04:20.400 --> 04:28.560]  tall, probably easy. But it's just, it works for what it is. It's all about working the
[04:28.560 --> 04:33.440]  surface area you're given, especially in areas where they limit plant counts. You know what
[04:33.440 --> 04:37.560]  I'm saying? That could do a lot of things for people.
[04:37.560 --> 04:40.080]  I'm writing down the word surface area because that's a good thing to think about. We're
[04:40.080 --> 04:44.400]  going to go back to that. So yeah, for people with limited plant counts in Colorado, well
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.080]  in our location, they're definitely messing with plant counts and we're not going to be
[04:49.080 --> 04:52.400]  able to grow as many plants as we used to. So what Spence has done, he's taken these
[04:52.400 --> 04:59.600]  giant pots and he takes a plant and he builds a PVC sort of a frame around it. So he's got
[04:59.600 --> 05:03.400]  a square frame now above the plant. How big is that square?
[05:03.400 --> 05:09.040]  Anywhere from four by, it's a four by four square cage. Basically you build a cage out
[05:09.040 --> 05:15.880]  of your PVC and you do layers of trellis for support. You know, if some people do, I'm
[05:15.880 --> 05:19.040]  not the only one that does it, by the way. There's a lot of people now that are trying
[05:19.040 --> 05:23.720]  it because it works. I mean, it's more bang for your buck. If you have, you know, especially
[05:23.720 --> 05:28.920]  it's, in my opinion, it's strain dependent. You can still get good yields, but you'll
[05:28.920 --> 05:33.680]  get better yields out of, you know, strains that are built for that system. Gorilla Glue
[05:33.680 --> 05:37.480]  loves it. Loves it. Bounty Killer loves it. You know what I'm saying? So like those moonshine
[05:37.480 --> 05:42.040]  haze that haze plant loves to just grow all inside that net. So there's things like that
[05:42.040 --> 05:47.160]  that works and cookies. They'll do decent, but not like, you know, a gorilla glue would
[05:47.160 --> 05:52.800]  do. So essentially it's a four by four cage with, you know, multiple trellises and then
[05:52.800 --> 05:58.800]  you will lollipop from the soil to the first trellis, you know? So everything from that
[05:58.800 --> 06:01.360]  first trellis up will be just nuts.
[06:01.360 --> 06:06.520]  Naked. Okay. Wow. All right. So you've got, you got your frame, you got a square and then
[06:06.520 --> 06:10.200]  you put a net over and then you just got, excuse me guys, I'm choked up from the dabs,
[06:10.200 --> 06:13.400]  but then you just got a bud going through each part of the screen and you put another
[06:13.400 --> 06:16.600]  screen on to support it. And then if it gets out of control because it's gorilla glue,
[06:16.600 --> 06:20.600]  you got to put another third screen up there if you need to. And then, but then again,
[06:20.600 --> 06:24.840]  it's more about, you know, canopy management, like making sure while it's, you know, especially
[06:24.840 --> 06:30.320]  through the stretch phase from day one of flower till day 21, 22 ish when it's growing
[06:30.320 --> 06:33.900]  like crazy, you'll want to get in there and really like tie them down and make sure they're
[06:33.900 --> 06:40.160]  not growing out of what they need to. So it's, you know, with those trellis nets, I think
[06:40.160 --> 06:43.800]  they're like three by three squares or four by four squares. You know, you want to try
[06:43.800 --> 06:48.440]  to essentially get a nug or a cola to hit every single one of those squares. I mean,
[06:48.440 --> 06:53.000]  there's, I don't know if there's 60 of them on a plant, so just, you know, the surface
[06:53.000 --> 06:59.880]  area works. Okay. Wow. Okay. So how early into veg do you start manipulating the screen?
[06:59.880 --> 07:09.040]  So typically what I do is I'll go from a one gallon pot or a clone to one gallon and then
[07:09.040 --> 07:13.440]  from a gallon to three and I'll let that three kind of get bulky in that three gallon
[07:13.440 --> 07:18.000]  and then straight into the final pots and then give them, you know, five, six weeks
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.520]  veg is really not as long as people think it is, especially when it's strain dependent
[07:21.520 --> 07:25.760]  and strains grow, you know, faster than other strains. Yeah. And it's going to be worth
[07:25.760 --> 07:29.440]  it in the end. You're going to get the weight in the end. So once you, you know, find your
[07:29.440 --> 07:35.960]  strain that you want to use, you know, you basically are training it through the nets,
[07:35.960 --> 07:39.960]  you know what I'm saying? So if it's getting too tall, throw another trellis on it, make
[07:39.960 --> 07:43.920]  it go back under the trellis. You know what I'm saying? So just keep bending it. Yeah,
[07:43.920 --> 07:48.320]  you can keep bending it. What I like to do is I like to just kind of, on your first screen,
[07:48.320 --> 07:52.360]  you kind of spread it open and then you let all the insides grow up and everything on
[07:52.360 --> 07:56.200]  the outside is going to grow around in the cage. So all those little shoots that would
[07:56.200 --> 08:00.000]  just be cut off if you're lollipopping normally are going to grow into actual branches. Yeah,
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.800]  they're going to go straight up into branches. So that's what the gorilla glue, you're going
[08:02.800 --> 08:07.600]  to get long extended branches. Like I had branches from like the bottom of the stalk
[08:07.600 --> 08:13.240]  that shoot clear up to the top. Damn canopy management. Okay. I read an article a long
[08:13.240 --> 08:16.480]  time ago that kind of introduced me to this idea. The article was actually called growing
[08:16.480 --> 08:20.840]  on the grid is what I think it was called. And the author was Eric Bicza. I'm going to
[08:20.840 --> 08:24.840]  Google that just to make sure. But he was used to be a writer for high times and he
[08:24.840 --> 08:31.600]  wrote an article about this. I'm searching his name while I talk. But I'm pretty sure
[08:31.600 --> 08:33.840]  that's it. I want to make sure because I want to give you guys a reference. Yeah, it's
[08:33.840 --> 08:37.120]  called growing on the grid with Eric Bicza. It'll kind of if you guys want to read more
[08:37.120 --> 08:43.280]  about it, this is kind of we're going to give you the, the inaction in practice sort of
[08:43.280 --> 08:47.540]  talk. Eric Bicza is he writes a lot. So he's going to give you a really technical explanation
[08:47.540 --> 08:52.800]  on it. However, I'm not sure how many times he's done it. Spence here has done it. Are
[08:52.800 --> 08:57.240]  you messaging Greenworks? We're going to try to get Greenworks to call in one day and we'll
[08:57.240 --> 09:03.000]  talk to him. We've got, I just actually learned how to record quality phone interviews using
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  FaceTime. I probably can do it with Skype also. I just haven't experimented with that
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.240]  yet. But the other night I opened up FaceTime and played around and I'll be able to record.
[09:10.240 --> 09:13.520]  So if you guys want to be on the show and you're far away, FaceTime is now the way to
[09:13.520 --> 09:18.960]  do it. It'll be great. Greenworks, I'm inviting you. Call us. Speaking of FaceTime, I'm going
[09:18.960 --> 09:22.000]  to get, I want to talk about this guy in a couple of minutes, but I'll talk more about
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.600]  canopy management. But I have a phone interview planned with a guy named Soil Grown from Instagram.
[09:28.600 --> 09:33.800]  We'll talk about his tech here pretty soon. Nice. Yeah. So you've got this a 20 gallon
[09:33.800 --> 09:39.160]  pot full of soil. You've got, you said you'd go from a clone cup into the one gallon pot
[09:39.160 --> 09:44.840]  into the three and then the three goes into the 20. Do you top before you transplant into
[09:44.840 --> 09:51.920]  the 20 at all? I'm not really a big topper depending on strain. So like for this
[09:51.920 --> 09:57.320]  system, Gorilla Glue, I don't, it's a plant to me. Some people do top it. Um, but I'm
[09:57.320 --> 10:01.800]  more of just a kind of, you know, working it through the net. So I'll take one branch
[10:01.800 --> 10:04.880]  and take it all the way to the left side and take this branch and take it to the right
[10:04.880 --> 10:09.640]  side. And eventually in that system, it's going to fill itself back up. Wow. I didn't
[10:09.640 --> 10:12.780]  realize it would work that extremely. So if I've got like, if I took my whole arm and
[10:12.780 --> 10:15.440]  just bent it over, it's going to just make little shoots and this is just going to be
[10:15.440 --> 10:19.720]  horizontal for four feet across the room pretty, or two feet from each. So essentially what
[10:19.720 --> 10:23.960]  you want to do is you, you know, as your, you know, your colas grow, your nodes stack
[10:23.960 --> 10:30.000]  vertically, they grow together up. So if you were to bend that branch all the way down,
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.680]  you'll take in each one of those bud sites, turn them up, which creates more bud sites
[10:34.680 --> 10:38.600]  on that plant than you would get stacking it together. Okay. So you're not going to,
[10:38.600 --> 10:42.120]  you may not get as many long colas. Yeah, you won't get like giant colas, but you'll
[10:42.120 --> 10:45.720]  get a bunch. And it's all about the space because we're not trying to grow concrete
[10:45.720 --> 10:49.200]  underneath the plant. We're trying to grow all of the space for the plant. All right.
[10:49.200 --> 10:52.440]  That makes pretty good sense. So you don't top it all. That's see, I would have topped
[10:52.440 --> 10:56.040]  them. That's why I would have fucked up from the very beginning. Some strains I do. Gorilla
[10:56.040 --> 11:00.680]  glue is one of the ones I, it kind of grows. The plant's wild. It grows by itself. It'll
[11:00.680 --> 11:03.920]  grow with his eyes closed. Yeah. We're probably taunting a lot of people because a lot of
[11:03.920 --> 11:07.520]  the world can't get their hands on a gorilla glue cut. But there's, there's, you know,
[11:07.520 --> 11:12.080]  there's some things I would do early in veg, you know, cause you give them a nice, you
[11:12.080 --> 11:16.400]  know, five, six week veg. So a couple, two weeks worth of, you know, femming and, you
[11:16.400 --> 11:21.040]  know, training and stuff like that. And then, you know, kind of once a three weeks before
[11:21.040 --> 11:24.880]  flower, you gotta, gotta let them heal up a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. At least two weeks,
[11:24.880 --> 11:29.040]  three weeks quit messing with them so that they know what to do. Cause they are apical
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.440]  dominant. They want to know which way is up still. They got to build up some hormones.
[11:33.440 --> 11:37.960]  All right. Um, man, I have like seven questions in my head and I can't, I was like, which
[11:37.960 --> 11:44.200]  ask a question. If it's not gorilla glue, uh, what other strain do you like to Scrog?
[11:44.200 --> 11:49.800]  Let's see. Cause I know you've got a killer arsenal. Have you done the white widow this
[11:49.800 --> 11:54.800]  way? No, no, this, this is my first go at it. So like, and it looks impressive for his
[11:54.800 --> 12:00.400]  first go at it. I'm blown away and it's, I'm still learning like the curve. I'm still picking
[12:00.400 --> 12:06.400]  up the curve, which is, you know, going from, you know, seven and tens up to twenties and
[12:06.400 --> 12:10.080]  two plants that are two to three times the size, you know, maintenance on those plants.
[12:10.080 --> 12:14.520]  Like you always have to be like cleaning up the bottoms and stuff. Cause imagine, you
[12:14.520 --> 12:20.920]  know, a six foot plant that's four and a half feet wide. You know, there's no light underneath
[12:20.920 --> 12:23.880]  there. So the things like the leaves and stuff die off just because they don't get light
[12:23.880 --> 12:28.960]  to survive. So you have to constantly be in there picking them off and things like that.
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.960]  It's a good thing to think about. I like that. You said that would have been a six foot tall
[12:32.960 --> 12:35.760]  plant and that you've gotten it down to four feet tall. That kind of puts it into a lot
[12:35.760 --> 12:43.040]  of perspective for me. Yeah. Like my, I'm running Govitas in a nine foot ceiling room,
[12:43.040 --> 12:47.360]  but it's all about canopy. You keep them down. The Govitas will work for you. It's just all
[12:47.360 --> 12:52.960]  about like, in my opinion, when you, when plants get tall and get close up to the Govitas,
[12:52.960 --> 12:57.280]  then they kind of feel how powerful they are. But when you get that canopy, yeah. When you
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.480]  get that canopy management all the way down, you know, it's all about surface area.
[13:02.800 --> 13:06.080]  Do you have a prediction on how much weight you're going to pull per thousand watt light
[13:06.080 --> 13:14.000]  with this new system? Well, right now per thousand watt, I'll probably pull on my first go
[13:16.480 --> 13:22.000]  probably six, 700 grams per Gorilla Glue. That's not bad at all. That's over a pound.
[13:22.000 --> 13:28.400]  That's a pound and a quarter. Yeah. Pound and a half if it comes back right. And that'll be
[13:28.960 --> 13:33.520]  a pound and a half with it. And it's only in a 4k. I'm running a 4k Govitas. And for a six week
[13:33.520 --> 13:37.920]  veg, that's not bad at all. Not at all. The plants really grow. Like when you put them from a three
[13:37.920 --> 13:42.640]  gallon pot into a plant, a pot. Oh, I've seen the stocks of your plants and they're bigger around
[13:42.640 --> 13:47.840]  than these microphones. They're almost as big as my arms. And I'm not that big. So like their
[13:47.840 --> 13:51.600]  wrist size for sure. Wow. Yeah. It's impressive. Your rooms look great. I've been in there. Well,
[13:51.600 --> 13:54.240]  I've been in there in a few days or so, but I've been there recently and they look pretty
[13:55.120 --> 14:01.280]  darn good. Shout out to Big Mike, Maddie, Michael, everybody that keeps the gardens on track. Who
[14:01.280 --> 14:06.400]  else helps over there? Is that the crew? Tater comes over. Tater. What's up cousin Tater? Phil.
[14:06.400 --> 14:10.560]  Phil. Oh, we can't forget Phil. I don't know. We need to get Phil on a podcast. Phil is really the,
[14:11.120 --> 14:16.480]  the, he raps. Phil raps? Oh, we can let him come rap. He can do all that. Throw up a beat and let
[14:16.480 --> 14:19.760]  Phil rap. He raps better than I do. I'll tell you that. Bring Phil and Slop. We can do some
[14:19.760 --> 14:24.000]  raps together. You guys are invited on the show, boys. If you listen to this, Michael,
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.920]  Big Mike, Slop, Phil, Maddie, you guys are always welcome. Whenever you want to do a podcast,
[14:27.920 --> 14:32.640]  just text me and say, it's podcast time. Can we do a live podcast at the cup?
[14:36.080 --> 14:40.320]  We couldn't do it like live broadcasting, but we could record it from there. Yeah.
[14:41.040 --> 14:45.840]  What if I have a house and all that? See, I talked about taking my recording equipment to the cup
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.520]  and just taking it to my hotel. Just bring it to my house. Yeah. Bring it to your house and we
[14:49.520 --> 14:53.520]  could do it up there and record people. Call cool people. That's what I was thinking. Hey,
[14:53.520 --> 14:57.840]  Hey guy, you're cool. Come, come podcast with us. You cool guys. You want to come get on my show?
[14:59.120 --> 15:01.680]  Yeah. If you guys are going to be, this is not set in stone, but if you guys are gonna be in
[15:01.680 --> 15:05.200]  the Denver area during the cannabis cup and you're down with Spence and you want to take a dab with
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.440]  Ross to Jeff in the garden of weed and crew, um, there's a good chance I will bring some,
[15:09.440 --> 15:13.360]  maybe not this big old setup, but I might bring some small recording gear. I just have a lot
[15:13.360 --> 15:17.280]  going on. I don't want this to disappear while I'm at the cup or something from the car or some
[15:17.280 --> 15:22.080]  shit I get paired. This is my livelihood, so I'd be crushed without it. But, uh, this gear,
[15:22.080 --> 15:26.640]  some kind of recording gear may end up at the can. I've got my phone if nothing else that works well.
[15:26.640 --> 15:30.480]  But yeah, let's do a podcast or let's at least hang out at the cannabis cup, you guys and take
[15:30.480 --> 15:36.240]  some dabs. This show won't come out for probably a week from it's tomorrow. Yeah. Weeks tomorrow.
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.160]  So yeah, but they'll have plenty of time. It's just the middle of March when this comes out,
[15:40.160 --> 15:43.360]  let's meet up the cannabis cup. You guys, let's take some dabs. I should have some
[15:43.360 --> 15:48.720]  Jeff's OG dabs. If Spence is down to blast it for me, I'll let him do that. No diggity. No diggity.
[15:48.720 --> 15:52.880]  Let's do this. All right. Where were we? We're talking about canopy management. I feel like we
[15:52.880 --> 15:58.160]  got a lot of that covered. Um, if you're not going to do the Scroggs, you can lollipop really heavily.
[15:58.160 --> 16:02.560]  That's another good way to make space for what you've got. Uh, kind of pay attention,
[16:02.560 --> 16:07.760]  get down on your knees and see how far the light is getting into your plants. And when you don't
[16:07.760 --> 16:11.120]  see any light hitting those leaves, just clean that shit off from the bottom there because
[16:11.120 --> 16:14.320]  there's no light getting there. It's going to be a waste of space. That's also, I mean,
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.920]  there's also other ways of canopy management. Like there's, you can do staking. Um, I do lots
[16:19.920 --> 16:26.240]  of staking. Me too. I honestly do both. I like the Scroggs system, but I still like the old school,
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.080]  you know, state, like look going in a room and being a hundred stakes deep in there. And it's
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.400]  like, Oh Lord, that's how a dread over at a river rock does it. If you walk through there, it's
[16:34.400 --> 16:39.680]  stake central. Those guys got all the wood. Yeah. Yeah. They got wood for days. I like some stakes.
[16:39.680 --> 16:43.680]  I grow some, I tend, I tend to grow tall plants. I use a seven gallon pot and I've
[16:43.680 --> 16:46.960]  vegem till they're about three and a half feet tall. So they end up six feet tall by the end.
[16:46.960 --> 16:52.080]  That requires either a tato tomato cage or some staking. I like the staking because I can pull
[16:52.080 --> 16:57.040]  it apart and I can bring, I can support each nug in a different area. So I can kind of do what you
[16:57.040 --> 17:03.200]  do. You just surface area. Yeah. Basically train it to like this, this Cola's got this section,
[17:03.200 --> 17:08.080]  this Cola's got this section. You want to kind of feel as many sections as you can. Yeah. Yeah. And
[17:08.080 --> 17:11.920]  if you think about what kind of genetics you're using, like you were saying, the golden goat or
[17:11.920 --> 17:16.320]  the gorilla glue makes a whole bunch of heads. The golden goat will make a whole bunch of heads.
[17:16.320 --> 17:20.720]  Cookies doesn't really like to do it. So maybe grow a whole bunch of small cookies plants.
[17:20.720 --> 17:24.320]  Like just if you can do a bunch of two foot tall, three foot tall cookies,
[17:25.360 --> 17:29.520]  yeah. That's the way to go with the plant like that. Just to see a green again or some OG Kush,
[17:29.520 --> 17:33.200]  just do a bunch of small ones instead of one giant plant. It's all about the genetics and
[17:33.200 --> 17:38.080]  canopy management, I guess. Yeah. Use a fan. You still need fans when you're doing all this.
[17:38.080 --> 17:41.120]  People forget about airflow. We can't stress enough about airflow. Somebody just told me
[17:41.120 --> 17:44.960]  they had powdery mildew. They couldn't figure out how to beat it. And they're asking what to spray.
[17:44.960 --> 17:48.720]  And I said, don't spray something, get a dehumidifier and clean out the air in your room.
[17:48.720 --> 17:54.240]  So there's simple stuff. Cut all that shit off. You can cut all that shit down. If I see any bad
[17:54.240 --> 17:58.800]  shit, it's going bye-bye. Bye-bye. All right. What else you got about canopy management? You
[17:58.800 --> 18:04.960]  want to talk about something different? It's been 15 minutes. Canopy management.
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.600]  What do you think about the levels of your lights during flower to help, you know, like
[18:13.600 --> 18:17.680]  in earlier in the first couple of weeks of flower, do you keep them lower? Do you keep them further
[18:17.680 --> 18:22.880]  away? You know, I kind of, my lights don't move. I start with, sometimes I'll put my plants on a
[18:22.880 --> 18:26.320]  five gallon bucket to get them higher. But for the duration of the grow, my plant, my lights don't
[18:26.320 --> 18:29.760]  move. I'm tall and I hate moving the lights down where I hit my head on them. I keep them as high
[18:29.760 --> 18:36.720]  as they'll go in the rooms. One thing I do is I don't change out from the halides to the sodiums
[18:36.720 --> 18:40.720]  for the first two weeks of flower. Just stay blue. Stay blue. Yeah. And they keep some, I feel like
[18:40.720 --> 18:46.800]  they don't stretch as far. And when I do the switch, I see them start to bulk up right away
[18:46.800 --> 18:51.200]  at the two weeks instead of doing that extra week. And I really think that that helps. And I have
[18:51.200 --> 18:56.000]  stopped doing. Do you veg with blue lights? Yeah. Okay. So there's just used that probably that
[18:56.000 --> 19:01.840]  change from blue to HBS kind of gives them a, a time span. They got to get used to that shit real
[19:01.840 --> 19:05.920]  quick. Right. I did dark periods, you know, before flower. And I was about to say, I've stopped doing
[19:05.920 --> 19:11.440]  that. I don't, uh, I don't, I don't find it useful. Really. It doesn't do anything. Yeah. I used to
[19:11.440 --> 19:17.200]  veg under 24 hours and then I would veg for 24 and then go dark for 24 and then start my flower. And
[19:17.200 --> 19:22.800]  I noticed it would trigger a little more quickly, but it's not enough time to do anything. I kind
[19:22.800 --> 19:27.200]  of like let my plants do their thing. For some reason. I just feel like when I go, cause you
[19:27.200 --> 19:33.360]  know, when, so I go 18 to six, yeah, that's what I'm getting into flower. So usually like when they
[19:33.360 --> 19:37.680]  sleep, they're ugly, you know, they're just sleeping. You know what I'm saying? I'm not the
[19:37.680 --> 19:43.360]  prettiest person when I'm asleep. Um, and then when they, you know, eventually when the lights come
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.320]  back on, they're get into the swing of things. And then, you know, before the lights cut off,
[19:48.320 --> 19:55.680]  they'll start going back down. And then when I usually hit that, um, I did 48 hours dark there.
[19:55.680 --> 20:00.080]  As soon as I go in the rooms, even when it's dark, they're already praying and ready. I feel like
[20:00.080 --> 20:04.640]  they're just preparing themselves for the time change. Yeah. Um, excited for it. Yeah. It's
[20:04.640 --> 20:10.080]  crazy how like you, the plants will be veg looking and then that dark period and you go in there and
[20:10.080 --> 20:15.520]  it's like, Oh shit. They're ready. Plants are these plants tell us what they want. That's for
[20:15.520 --> 20:20.240]  sure. I liked it. Cause don't be afraid to try a different light cycle. My mother plants run on a
[20:20.240 --> 20:25.680]  19 five cycle recommended by D or night. Is it 19 five? Yeah. 19 five recommended by DJ short.
[20:25.680 --> 20:29.840]  And that's the best performance I've ever had from a mother plant. So don't be afraid to
[20:29.840 --> 20:35.600]  experiment with some stuff. Uh, now I do the, uh, I do 18, six of my veg areas. And then my flower,
[20:35.600 --> 20:40.240]  I just go straight 12, 12 because I don't really, uh, I don't do the, all the dark period. I don't
[20:40.240 --> 20:44.880]  do, I do 12, 12, the dark periods. The only thing I do just start flower. Some of the best herb I've
[20:44.880 --> 20:50.720]  ever grown was actually grown under a, uh, under a single hood and a five by five hydro hut with a
[20:50.720 --> 20:56.000]  600 watt, uh, high pressure sodium and a 400 watt metal halide in the same bulb. And that grows
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.880]  illable that a hydro farm makes a double bulb. Yeah. And I used one of those. I liked it. That
[21:00.880 --> 21:05.440]  was great. Great. But it had great flavor. It looked great. Some of my best pictures came from
[21:05.440 --> 21:10.000]  that run of flower. It was definitely quality buds. My best girl of that headband cut ever.
[21:11.040 --> 21:14.880]  Yeah. What are you, uh, what are you dabbing over there, bro? Uh, some bounty killer.
[21:16.720 --> 21:21.600]  Nice. Shout out to the dude that, uh, grew the bounty killer. What's up, bro. I see you over
[21:21.600 --> 21:28.880]  there. I know what you're doing. Appreciate you every day. So, uh, you want to talk about green
[21:28.880 --> 21:32.960]  works for a minute or not green works? Uh, what's his name? Uh, should I wrote it down? Cause I keep
[21:33.040 --> 21:36.800]  soil grown. There's so many of these new Instagram names that I can't keep up on. So I try to be on
[21:36.800 --> 21:42.960]  top of all the social media, but there's so many things going on. Uh, if you guys have something
[21:42.960 --> 21:46.560]  that you want to hear about canopy management that we missed remind me, cause we went quickly.
[21:46.560 --> 21:51.360]  Uh, there's still more to talk about, but we're, uh, we've done enough on it. That's like 15 minutes.
[21:51.360 --> 21:56.640]  We're going to talk about some new shit. Oh, you hear that? You guys, that's a mothership rig right
[21:56.640 --> 22:00.240]  over there. It's a little mothership mini with the swing arm, mothership carb cap on it. It's
[22:00.320 --> 22:03.280]  a bounty killer, live resin. Life doesn't get much better than that. Y'all
[22:04.720 --> 22:08.240]  the look on Spence's face proves it. I'm not sure that he knows where he is right now.
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.200]  Your eyes, your hoodie and the microphone cover are all the same shade of red.
[22:13.840 --> 22:17.600]  Don't worry. I ain't worried. I'm just letting you know, don't try to drive home like that.
[22:17.600 --> 22:20.240]  Uh, so there's this new shit. It's called Rosin.
[22:21.040 --> 22:25.760]  Rosen. Rosen. Rosen. I've been calling it Rosen. I've been calling it Rosen. I've been calling it
[22:26.320 --> 22:30.800]  Rotten Rosen, Rotten Rosen, whichever way you want to do it. Uh, it's spelled R O S I N. So
[22:30.800 --> 22:36.400]  we can't argue that. Um, I saw it first on Instagram from a dude named soil called at soil
[22:36.400 --> 22:41.440]  grown this dude. Uh, what do you think, bro? How do you feel about it? I don't want to give
[22:41.440 --> 22:44.240]  away too much of his tech. Cause we're going to have him here on the show pretty soon.
[22:44.240 --> 22:52.320]  Um, I will gladly support somebody trying something new for sure. Like no doubts. Um,
[22:53.040 --> 22:58.400]  I was listening to hash church today. Um, shout out to hash church. Check that out.
[22:58.960 --> 23:03.200]  Don't like, don't freak out on me. Cause I say this cause people argue about it all the time,
[23:03.200 --> 23:10.560]  but it's the first non solvent actual, not nut. There's not like water as much as you don't,
[23:10.560 --> 23:16.080]  you don't believe it. It's a solvent. Um, then the butane and propane, those are all solvents,
[23:16.080 --> 23:21.520]  but he's just using pure heat to extract oils. There's no, you can't use heat as a solvent,
[23:21.520 --> 23:25.120]  heat and pressure. That's all he's doing. Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty impressive. You see the picture
[23:25.120 --> 23:29.760]  of the slot, like the whole slab he posted. Oh no. I saw one that's like rolled up in a worm
[23:29.760 --> 23:34.960]  around a car, a giant one. It was as big as his face. So he's been going in lately. Yeah. I've
[23:34.960 --> 23:38.960]  got a scheduled phone interview with him. Uh, he said Tuesday or Wednesday, he hasn't confirmed a
[23:38.960 --> 23:42.480]  specific time, but we're going to talk to him. I'll probably just piece that right into this
[23:42.480 --> 23:46.480]  episode. You guys, if I can get him to call me on time, that's all I need. And I'll throw that
[23:46.480 --> 23:50.320]  into this show probably right here. So here's an interview, maybe hopefully with soil grown.
[23:50.320 --> 23:54.720]  How are you doing today, bro? Great, man. I'm doing good. Cool, man. Thanks for pulling some
[23:54.720 --> 23:59.840]  time away from your work to join us. Yeah, not a problem. Uh, dude, I'm just going to,
[23:59.840 --> 24:02.400]  I know you're a busy man. I'm just going to get right to it and start asking a couple of
[24:02.400 --> 24:06.880]  quick questions. First of all, can you explain to me a little bit about what RosinTech is and
[24:06.880 --> 24:16.000]  how you got the idea? Um, well, okay. RosinTech, I think that comes from, uh, from somebody named
[24:16.080 --> 24:23.600]  compassion that I guess was, uh, on IC Mag. Um, he does, uh, he does a RosinTech with like a no melt
[24:25.120 --> 24:30.160]  hash, you know, so you take your hash, your no melt, and you can turn it into a, uh, melt by
[24:30.160 --> 24:35.600]  pulling all the, uh, the resin out of the no melt, you know, with a double boiler, a bowl
[24:36.480 --> 24:44.080]  and your no melt. So, uh, so I did this, uh, different method. Um, you know, Rosin,
[24:44.080 --> 24:48.480]  I guess what Rosin is, is technically it's just a form of resin obtained from like plants, you know,
[24:49.200 --> 24:53.280]  that's where like, I don't, I don't know why it's called Rosin. I mean, it's similar.
[24:53.280 --> 24:58.560]  I've Rosin what I know Rosin as was like, you know, for both strings for a friction. So you
[24:58.560 --> 25:04.240]  can get better. But, uh, I don't know where the term actually stuck in cannabis, but that's where
[25:04.240 --> 25:10.640]  I know it from. Um, and I, it's really kind of related to resin, you know, in a way. Okay. All
[25:10.880 --> 25:17.280]  right. But, uh, the way I got my, my idea, I mean, it came from basically I'm, I'm a hash,
[25:17.280 --> 25:23.520]  you know, so I'm going to have my melt. So I decided, uh, I need to figure something out.
[25:23.520 --> 25:28.800]  I have all this no melt. And I remember back when, uh, selected Nick, but something on,
[25:29.600 --> 25:36.160]  on, uh, the IG about, uh, taking like a flat iron just for pressing, you know, just to press out
[25:36.160 --> 25:40.480]  your hash much simpler than heating up a wand or, you know, doing something like that. You can
[25:40.480 --> 25:47.280]  set the right temp just to press it out and have a proper press. Yeah. Well, I used to take my wife's
[25:47.280 --> 25:52.720]  hair curler and I would, uh, sometimes I'd get it too hot, you know, by accident, I would notice
[25:52.720 --> 25:57.680]  that it would separate, you see the oil and then the hash. I wouldn't think any, this was like,
[25:57.680 --> 26:01.280]  you know, this was a, this was a while back. So I didn't think anything of it. I would just
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.160]  pull the parchment back up. And now I have a press caddy that was overpressed and with too
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.920]  much heat, but, uh, otherwise it was some press hash, you know, okay. Made it smokeable.
[26:13.600 --> 26:16.320]  Yeah. I mean, it was better. I would be like, that was,
[26:18.480 --> 26:23.280]  that was all not too long ago, maybe about two years ago. Okay. Probably about two years ago
[26:23.280 --> 26:28.160]  when I did that. And then, uh, yeah, that just doing like the French effect, anything that
[26:28.480 --> 26:32.480]  now I would triple press it, you know, try to try to increase the milk quality on it.
[26:32.480 --> 26:39.200]  Some stuff, some stuff. So what gave you the idea to just start pressing straight buds without trying
[26:39.200 --> 26:45.920]  to hash in there? All right. So, uh, so once I ran out of my, uh, no milk, all my no milk
[26:45.920 --> 26:51.680]  and turning it into Rosman smoking, we just took, I don't know. We're just sitting here smoking.
[26:51.680 --> 26:57.120]  You know, I'm not, I smoke flour, but my thing is dabbing. I'm more for the extracts, you know,
[26:57.200 --> 27:03.680]  me too. Definitely. Yeah. So, so we're just, I'm sitting here, uh, bullshitting with my,
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.480]  uh, father-in-law and, uh, I'm like, Hey, let's try this. I grabbed the nut. He's like,
[27:08.480 --> 27:12.320]  what are you doing? I put it in between the parchment. Just like I would, uh, uh, you know,
[27:13.440 --> 27:20.560]  a rolled up ball at hash and, uh, my surprise resin squeeze out of the bud. We were both in
[27:20.560 --> 27:26.400]  shock, like no way. So I scooped up the oil, did it again, scooped it up. There was a little,
[27:26.400 --> 27:31.600]  there was enough on the end. It looked like a dab, but we tried it out. And, uh,
[27:33.280 --> 27:38.160]  and, uh, to my surprise, you know, nothing, nothing, no, no, no residue.
[27:39.600 --> 27:46.880]  And sometimes even good VHO will leave a residue sometimes. So that's impressive. Yeah, exactly.
[27:46.880 --> 27:50.080]  Very sweet. Very fucking cool, man. You got lucky figuring that one out.
[27:51.040 --> 27:55.280]  Yeah, I would, I would, you know, call it luck, luck for way to say it, but, uh, I mean, I just,
[27:55.280 --> 27:59.840]  I'd say I'm not, I mean, if I didn't do what I did, like if I didn't stay here and smoke,
[27:59.840 --> 28:04.960]  like I do every day and I wasn't so much into the, to the concentrate aspect of cannabis,
[28:05.600 --> 28:09.200]  you know, I wouldn't be the one to strike the luck. Yeah, man, much respect for putting in the
[28:09.200 --> 28:12.720]  work for putting in the time to get to that and for loving that the extracts as much as you do to
[28:12.720 --> 28:17.680]  find that for us. Cause it seems to be the thing now, bro, you're blowing up on Instagram. Yeah.
[28:17.760 --> 28:22.160]  I'm a, uh, no, I didn't. And when I posted, I really didn't expect that. I thought it'd be
[28:22.160 --> 28:27.520]  like, you know, something, some of these, uh, um, hash makers are like, could, could utilize
[28:27.520 --> 28:31.200]  for all their, their no-no. And then once I started posting up the flower, I was just thinking,
[28:31.200 --> 28:36.640]  you know, some people would be like, you know, in awe about it. But I didn't expect that. No way.
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.720]  Yeah. Can you tell me just kind of a brief, I know it's just a pretty simple process. Can you tell me
[28:40.720 --> 28:46.160]  kind of briefly how you do it? Yeah. I mean, I would say it's probably the most simplest process
[28:46.160 --> 28:51.360]  of extraction. I would say, uh, if you want to do it, the most basic way to do it for anybody at
[28:51.360 --> 28:56.880]  home is just grab your, uh, grab your ladies flat iron or hair straightener and get the widest one
[28:56.880 --> 29:03.040]  you can. Uh, digital settings would be optimum. If not, I mean, when I first did it, I had it up
[29:03.040 --> 29:11.280]  to 420 degrees. Yeah. I mean, the terpenes were, I wasn't worried about, uh, I was, I wanted
[29:11.840 --> 29:16.320]  the terpenes, but I wanted that now, you know, so to my surprise, I was pulling melts out and now
[29:16.320 --> 29:20.480]  that I've fine-tuned it a little bit, and there's going to be a lot more evolving to it. It's just
[29:20.480 --> 29:26.320]  in its beginning stage for sure. But, uh, you know, fine tuning and stuff to get those, those
[29:26.320 --> 29:32.080]  turps out of it. But so you just get the, uh, the straightening comb or the flat iron and then just
[29:32.080 --> 29:37.520]  basically put some parchment in there. Yeah. So you put it between the parchment and then, uh,
[29:37.520 --> 29:41.120]  put it between the flat iron. You want to do it in a quick process as fast as possible,
[29:41.120 --> 29:45.200]  put it between that flat iron and then press it as hard as you can, you know,
[29:45.200 --> 29:50.400]  press as hard as you can for about, I'd say one to two, two to three seconds, depending like, uh,
[29:50.400 --> 29:56.960]  how hot you got your iron, but you really, you hear it come out. It mostly, it comes down to
[29:56.960 --> 30:00.960]  trial and error and hearing that, that sound of knowing when to pull up and,
[30:01.680 --> 30:05.760]  you know, knowing when you have it too high, it's, it's a lot of ear. It really is.
[30:07.520 --> 30:10.720]  All right. So I just got to practice and waste a couple of buds, but it doesn't look like you're
[30:10.720 --> 30:14.160]  doing a lot of buds at one time. So that's not too big of a deal to waste a couple of nuggets.
[30:15.280 --> 30:18.640]  Yeah. Yeah. I don't do the hair straightening anymore. I mean, I do the press now.
[30:18.640 --> 30:23.040]  Yeah. I see you doing big things now. Yeah. It's a little bigger, you know,
[30:23.040 --> 30:29.120]  I'm still, I have a lot of other plans for, for something to make it a more efficient process.
[30:29.120 --> 30:33.600]  But right now this, this seems to work. It's if I can fine tune this to make it workable,
[30:33.600 --> 30:36.480]  then whatever goes on after it's just going to be better.
[30:36.480 --> 30:39.680]  There you go. Keep improving every day. That's the way this industry is working.
[30:39.680 --> 30:43.280]  So how are you doing? Are you doing anything special to prepare the buds? Do you like them
[30:43.280 --> 30:46.320]  a little moist? You like them dry? Do you like them crispy? Do you like them cured?
[30:47.600 --> 30:54.000]  I'd say a properly grown, well cured bud. You see me, that's how I would look at it.
[30:54.000 --> 30:58.800]  But that is too dry, works. Something that might have a little too much moisture,
[30:59.520 --> 31:05.680]  it probably will work. I haven't had too much like a trial with that. I've had like fresh
[31:05.680 --> 31:11.920]  nugs and I haven't had too many results with it. Nothing, nothing to be ecstatic about.
[31:11.920 --> 31:14.960]  Okay. So it's better to let the moisture come out a little bit, let it dry up.
[31:16.640 --> 31:21.920]  Yeah. And I don't know how the moisture is going to affect the X-PAC, whether we see it or not.
[31:21.920 --> 31:28.240]  I can't see how it wouldn't, you know, moisture, heat and resonance just somehow trapping in there.
[31:28.240 --> 31:34.400]  Just like when you're pecking some not properly dried IWE, you know, you're trapping moisture.
[31:34.400 --> 31:39.600]  So I don't, I can see that being the same for this process.
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.840]  All right. Do certain strains work better? Do like Indica's or Sativa's work better? Or do
[31:43.840 --> 31:46.160]  you have a favorite strain that works the best for making rosin?
[31:47.280 --> 31:52.080]  Right now I'm finding that Indica's are producing, they have the most resin. I mean,
[31:52.080 --> 31:58.320]  I've even had some real frosty Sativa's. It's only putting out like eight to 9%,
[31:58.880 --> 32:06.160]  but I've had some Indica's pull around, I mean, anywhere from like nine to 22%, you know?
[32:06.160 --> 32:08.960]  Wow. That's impressive. That's getting up there with the, the BHO pulls.
[32:10.080 --> 32:13.680]  Yeah. I mean, it really, that depends on how much time and effort you want to put into it.
[32:13.680 --> 32:17.920]  If you want to sit there and do it as point one, I mean, you want to break the bug down.
[32:17.920 --> 32:21.920]  If you're doing it in a whole gram, you're probably not going to get the percentage you're looking for.
[32:22.880 --> 32:27.600]  On big scale, it might suffice because it's going to be how efficient the process is.
[32:29.600 --> 32:33.520]  All right. So break it up a little bit or the more, the more broken up, the better actually.
[32:33.520 --> 32:39.280]  All right. That's good to know. How does the flavor of a rosin dab compare to like a BHO
[32:39.280 --> 32:41.520]  dab or a saltless dab? Are you still getting good flavors?
[32:42.640 --> 32:47.840]  Yeah, man. It's unbelievable. I can't wait to send in some of these samples for testing.
[32:48.480 --> 32:51.680]  That was probably one of my next questions. I was going to ask if you've had anything to add.
[32:52.240 --> 32:54.320]  If anybody that you know has had it tested yet.
[32:55.200 --> 32:59.200]  Yeah, actually a foundation extract. I think somebody else had some actually hash
[32:59.200 --> 33:05.360]  vials we tested. It seemed like it was pretty high in CBD. I posted up the results on my IG page with
[33:06.640 --> 33:12.160]  the results from foundation extract. I think it was like 83% THC and 8% terpene.
[33:12.160 --> 33:13.600]  Wow. That's pretty good.
[33:15.280 --> 33:20.640]  And I don't know who it's from. I'm just guessing that it was made off of a hair straightener.
[33:22.400 --> 33:26.240]  So a little bit less control on it.
[33:27.120 --> 33:30.480]  Have you seen any hatred from all the BHO people, the guys that spent thousands of
[33:30.480 --> 33:32.960]  dollars on equipment and now you're just doing it with a shirt press?
[33:35.600 --> 33:42.320]  Yeah, I've seen a little bit of hate. It's not bad. Some of it's more of like on the down low.
[33:42.320 --> 33:46.640]  Some people are kind of burnt. And then most of the time, there's a lot of people are just
[33:47.440 --> 33:54.800]  not giving it a chance. But then I'll see some of these people changing their minds about it.
[33:54.800 --> 33:58.960]  They're trying it out. Once they try it, you can't knock it till you try it.
[33:58.960 --> 34:03.200]  Right. That's how this industry is though. This industry is kind of tricky. They make decisions
[34:03.200 --> 34:03.680]  right away.
[34:04.560 --> 34:09.920]  Yeah, it is. You're right. You're right. It's just the way the world works. But when you do that,
[34:09.920 --> 34:12.400]  you're going to be the one to miss out on something like this.
[34:12.400 --> 34:14.960]  That's the truth. Guys, if you ever get a chance, anybody that's listening,
[34:15.360 --> 34:19.440]  if you get a chance, take a dab of some rosin before you diss it. Try the rosin
[34:19.440 --> 34:23.200]  tech yourself. Don't be a hater. So bro, are you going to be a...
[34:23.200 --> 34:26.320]  There you go. How's the high? Is it similar to a normal dab?
[34:27.600 --> 34:31.840]  Yeah, I'd say it's strong. I would compare it more to like
[34:33.280 --> 34:37.120]  IWE or like a hash dab rather than a BHO dab.
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.880]  Do you get that heavy chested feeling like you do sometimes from a water dab or an IWE dab? Do
[34:42.880 --> 34:46.160]  you get that heavy chested, like thick feeling sometimes?
[34:47.120 --> 34:50.080]  In my opinion, it's the smoothest dab.
[34:50.080 --> 34:52.800]  Nice. Are you going to be in Denver for the Cannabis Cup?
[34:53.920 --> 35:01.200]  I'm still not 100% sure about the Denver Cup, but we're going to most likely be in Chalice
[35:01.200 --> 35:01.840]  this year.
[35:01.840 --> 35:05.520]  All right. Well, if you were at the Denver Cup, you better find me. I'm a tall white guy with
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.320]  dreadlocks. I would love to taste the rosin tech for sure. We'll definitely link up. We'll make
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.040]  that worth our time. Do you think you're going to enter any contests or any cups or anything like
[35:15.040 --> 35:16.000]  that anytime soon, bro?
[35:19.120 --> 35:25.120]  I think the next cup going on that we're going to enter is Chalice. We're setting up for it.
[35:25.120 --> 35:26.400]  We're starting to prepare for it.
[35:26.400 --> 35:28.000]  Nice. You're going to put rosin tech in there?
[35:28.880 --> 35:32.800]  Yeah, definitely going to see some salt and less heat extracted oil.
[35:35.040 --> 35:37.920]  And then I'm hoping to have some iFlex in as well.
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.440]  Very cool. I can't wait to see what the rosin tech does up next to
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.760]  Ice Wax and also up next to BHO. They'll probably make a category for it by the time
[35:45.760 --> 35:48.080]  that the event happens, but I'm still excited to see it.
[35:49.680 --> 35:55.280]  As far as I see it, it's non-salt. Don't they throw the clear in that category?
[35:55.280 --> 35:59.520]  Yeah. All right. So you're in that category. You're going to be competing, bro. You'll be
[35:59.520 --> 36:02.560]  right up there with those guys. I have faith in it. From what I've seen, people are loving it.
[36:03.520 --> 36:09.440]  And the fact is, there's natural terpenes, whether it went through heat, the process that it went,
[36:09.440 --> 36:17.920]  just can't forget that it's solvent-less. I'm not big on smoking solvent extract. That's something
[36:17.920 --> 36:23.760]  that's in my mind. I have for years. I'm not against it. There's some very enjoyable
[36:24.640 --> 36:30.560]  extracts made from solvents, but my preferred smoke is solvent-less.
[36:30.560 --> 36:32.800]  And a lot of people seem to be turning that way lately, too.
[36:33.920 --> 36:38.560]  Yeah. I see the Clean Meds movement going. It's definitely picking up.
[36:38.560 --> 36:41.760]  Well, thanks for supporting the Clean Meds movement, bro. We need more people like yourself
[36:41.760 --> 36:45.200]  that are aware of what we're doing for the community and to our bodies and with our medicine.
[36:45.200 --> 36:47.120]  That's cool. I appreciate it and respect it a lot, bro.
[36:48.000 --> 36:49.120]  Yeah. All four of them.
[36:49.120 --> 36:52.320]  For sure. Man, I'm going to wrap up this phone interview. I told you I'd only take about 15
[36:52.320 --> 36:56.240]  minutes of your time. We're getting pretty close to that. How can people find you on Instagram?
[36:56.560 --> 36:57.680]  On Soil Grown.
[36:59.680 --> 37:01.520]  So, at Soil Grown on Instagram.
[37:02.320 --> 37:09.520]  Yeah, or hashtag Soil Grown Tech. I don't really do too much of the hashtag for the Soil Grown Tech,
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.480]  but you'll find, you'll see the Soil Grown. Just type in Rosentech and you'll definitely
[37:14.480 --> 37:15.920]  find Soil Grown somewhere in there.
[37:15.920 --> 37:19.040]  There you go. Search for Rosentech on Instagram. You'll definitely find this guy.
[37:19.040 --> 37:21.520]  Bro, do you have any shout outs or anything you want to give or anything you want us to
[37:21.520 --> 37:24.560]  look at since you've got a lot of people listening to you? Something you want to say to the world?
[37:25.200 --> 37:30.800]  I would just say don't knock it. Don't knock it until you try it. Give it a shot. Just remember
[37:30.800 --> 37:36.320]  that it's clean meds. Although it's a simple extraction process, it does take a lot of work.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.600]  I would call it a connoisseur's extract. Connoisseur's concentrate.
[37:41.600 --> 37:44.880]  Nice. I like that. All right, bro. Well, I truly appreciate you calling in for the show,
[37:44.880 --> 37:48.160]  man. If you ever have anything else you want to say on the show, you've got my phone number.
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.200]  Stay in touch with me. If you're in Denver, I look forward to meeting you at the end of the
[37:52.160 --> 37:56.320]  show. Go take a dab of some Rosentech for me and I'll take a dab of some Therpex BHO for you.
[37:57.360 --> 38:00.000]  Definitely. Right on, brother. Stay up. Take care of yourself.
[38:00.720 --> 38:02.400]  You too. Take care. Peace, brother. Later.
[38:03.520 --> 38:05.520]  All right. That was fun. Maybe that happened. Maybe it didn't.
[38:06.560 --> 38:09.440]  Maybe it did. Maybe it didn't. I don't know. Hopefully it did.
[38:09.440 --> 38:13.120]  But this dude, yeah, you just heard what he said. Hopefully, right? Maybe. Yeah.
[38:13.120 --> 38:16.080]  All right. Well, thanks for being on the show, man. Go take a dab of some Rosentech for me.
[38:16.080 --> 38:18.160]  And I'll take a dab of some Therpex BHO for you.
[38:18.240 --> 38:21.920]  Yeah. You just heard what he said. Hopefully, right? Maybe. Yeah. That's a fun way to do a
[38:21.920 --> 38:28.880]  podcast. So, Spence is heating me up one of these Bounty Killer Live resin dabs off the mother ship.
[38:29.520 --> 38:32.160]  I might not be able to talk for a couple seconds because Spence likes to wreck me.
[38:33.920 --> 38:38.480]  You ready? I'm ready, bro. I'm taking a drink. I'm grabbing the dab. Spence holds onto the rig
[38:38.480 --> 38:42.720]  for a little bit of time because he knows I like to take dabs that are too hot, which we call glowy
[38:42.720 --> 38:47.120]  in this crew. They're not even like super glowy, but it's just hot.
[38:47.120 --> 38:51.040]  And it's a little too hot. I'll agree. But I like the way I like the way I get the dab when it's
[38:51.040 --> 38:56.240]  that way. Clunk. He's just smacking his mother ship rig on the table like it's nothing.
[39:05.010 --> 39:06.050]  That sounds so cool.
[39:08.290 --> 39:11.250]  Oh, that's me getting super high right now is what that sound is.
[39:12.050 --> 39:15.810]  The sound of my brain is better. It's like bubble wrap and fireworks.
[39:17.090 --> 39:18.290]  And pop rocks.
[39:18.290 --> 39:22.450]  Pop rocks. Yeah. My brain feels like pop rocks. That's what I'm going to say next time.
[39:22.690 --> 39:25.490]  What do you what do you think of the
[39:25.490 --> 39:33.010]  raws and tech, bro? I'm blown away by it. He's using equipment that everybody has. I've seen
[39:33.010 --> 39:37.170]  people use flat iron. I think black people call that a pressing comb, don't they?
[39:38.210 --> 39:43.010]  It's not the same. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. They're not the same. They're not the same. All right.
[39:43.010 --> 39:46.850]  There's a girl that see on the one show that you're on one show that you're on. I said you're
[39:46.850 --> 39:51.010]  the only black person that's been in my house. I'm in Colorado. I grew up in Southern California,
[39:51.090 --> 39:54.210]  bro. I had like all kinds of black folks on my block. But this one girl,
[39:54.210 --> 39:57.730]  Leticia, she had she called it a flat iron or a straightening comb. I thought it was the same
[39:57.730 --> 40:04.290]  shit, but never mind. Maybe not. I don't know. But these guys are using shit that's around the
[40:04.290 --> 40:09.650]  house and handmade Adam hand from handmade apparel. He showed me his what he posted his
[40:09.650 --> 40:13.330]  slab because, of course, he had a T-shirt press already. And he's like, I got this game figured
[40:13.330 --> 40:18.370]  out and he's winning. But I'm amazed that they're using shit that is just kind of around the house
[40:18.530 --> 40:24.450]  and making Earl solventless hash that is dabble. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't tried it yet.
[40:24.450 --> 40:34.210]  I actually a lot of trying, but I think it has more something to do with the moisture content
[40:34.210 --> 40:42.210]  of how your weed is dry. Like weed down here is really dry. So it's just maybe I needed to do
[40:42.210 --> 40:46.930]  more pressure or something like that. It's just we'll talk to him here in a couple of days.
[40:47.890 --> 40:52.770]  I'm very interested to hopefully by the time this airs, we've got his part to piece in and
[40:52.770 --> 40:57.010]  you actually know because that Rosin tech is great. And if just I'm going to talk about it
[40:57.010 --> 41:00.130]  because I wanted to save and let him talk about it, but maybe we won't get his interview.
[41:00.130 --> 41:05.170]  This dude's taking a T-shirt press and he's modified it and he puts a layer of parchment
[41:05.170 --> 41:09.970]  paper, a little layer of buds and another parchment paper and squishes it for about
[41:09.970 --> 41:14.690]  four seconds and lifts it up, pulls the parchment out. He's got pretty much Earl.
[41:15.010 --> 41:18.450]  It looks like slides the weed off into the floor and stomps on it all day.
[41:20.770 --> 41:25.010]  I've seen some dude who has a tea jar and just once he's done with it, he makes tea in the
[41:25.010 --> 41:28.770]  morning with it because it's still, it's still got stuff in there. He didn't get it all out.
[41:28.770 --> 41:34.130]  Yeah. Yeah. So big shout out to a soil grown. If he, if he called in and did that interview,
[41:34.130 --> 41:37.810]  extra super huge shout out. If he didn't still check him out on Instagram, it's at soil grown.
[41:38.450 --> 41:43.410]  Check out the Rosin tech. It's really, really, really cool. Since I'm going through my notes
[41:43.410 --> 41:47.010]  here, I have to give a big shout out to Judy. What's up, Judy. Hope you're listening to the
[41:47.010 --> 41:52.210]  show. I appreciate it. Sorry. I'm coughing from that dab. I have one more thing to talk about
[41:52.210 --> 41:56.770]  that. I have to remind you guys, um, the prizes have been shipped. Remember we did prizes from
[41:56.770 --> 42:02.130]  episode 50. Those have been shipped. Uh, two people never gave me their addresses. Both of
[42:02.130 --> 42:07.650]  those prize winners were from Facebook. You guys go on Facebook, uh, and give me your address.
[42:07.650 --> 42:14.050]  If you want your prize, you have until the next episode airs to claim your prize. And if those
[42:14.050 --> 42:20.290]  prizes are not claimed, they will be, uh, sacrificed to the cannabis gods and recycled
[42:20.290 --> 42:29.010]  for future episode prizes. All right. Um, I said that I said that cool, cool. Uh, what else you got
[42:29.010 --> 42:33.970]  on your brain, bro? How things been, man, you've even grown your ass off. I don't know, man.
[42:34.770 --> 42:38.610]  Just getting ready for, uh, we're going to go on a cup tour.
[42:41.010 --> 42:43.330]  So Denver's our first one. Then we're going to do
[42:45.410 --> 42:50.850]  Oregon, possibly Michigan. Wow. Michigan that's stretching out far.
[42:51.570 --> 42:55.010]  It's, it's one of the smaller ones and they accept out of state cards. So,
[42:55.010 --> 43:00.370]  Oh, sweet. That's cool. And then Seattle, Seattle's fun, bro. I love
[43:00.370 --> 43:04.050]  the weather in Seattle off the chain. Yeah. And you got family there, don't you? Yeah. So
[43:04.050 --> 43:08.530]  shout out to the family, the food, the weather. All right. See, I got to start traveling to more
[43:08.530 --> 43:13.490]  of these cups. I'm just a solo grower, so I don't have anybody backing up my girl when I go. So it's
[43:13.490 --> 43:17.970]  hard to, uh, hard to get away for three or four days after that third day, you start like, I don't
[43:17.970 --> 43:23.090]  even, I mean, when I had to go to Vegas for the secret, I was like, Oh my God, I need to go home.
[43:23.090 --> 43:27.970]  Somebody take me home. Yup. Let's just go first flight. I need to get there, check on the plants
[43:27.970 --> 43:31.890]  and then I'll fly back. Yeah. Yeah. It's all it's about. Just got to walk in the room, make sure
[43:31.890 --> 43:37.010]  that everything's alive. One time, uh, tweet me guys. What do you do when you go out of town
[43:37.010 --> 43:40.610]  and you grow pot? How do you keep your plants alive when you go out of town? I'm just curious.
[43:40.610 --> 43:45.650]  I know what to do. I just want to know how you do it. Tweet me. It's at GFYH podcast. Curious.
[43:46.290 --> 43:52.930]  I want to know, tell me what you do. What, um, how's that, uh, your strain you're working on
[43:52.930 --> 43:58.290]  going? So, uh, right before you came over tonight, I was at the grow space taking pictures
[43:58.850 --> 44:04.210]  of like 20 different phenotypes of black cherry Kim and I've narrowed it down. There's one that
[44:04.210 --> 44:09.890]  is definitely a breeder. Uh, it's purple. It's got the great bug structure. It smells like a
[44:09.890 --> 44:14.690]  purple Laffy Taffy. It's got a weird, and you can smell it from far away. It's got a weird
[44:14.690 --> 44:22.210]  overpowering aroma. Laffy Taffy. Right. I don't like grape. Coincidentally, I'm black and I don't
[44:22.210 --> 44:30.850]  like grapes. Sorry. I wasn't going there. Um, but I do like Laffy Taffy. So that flavor. Yeah. Yeah.
[44:30.850 --> 44:35.330]  And the smell too. You can open a pack of Laffy Taffy and smell it before you even eat it. And
[44:35.330 --> 44:39.410]  that's kind of how it is when I walked in the room and I, I can smell that one plant all the time.
[44:39.410 --> 44:42.610]  So I had to single it out. I was like this little bitch right here is going to be a winner.
[44:42.610 --> 44:47.170]  And she happened to be one of the best purple phenotypes. Uh, she grows a nice top Cola,
[44:47.170 --> 44:51.890]  nice structure. So I'm going to use that one. And then there's one, uh, that's a little lighter
[44:51.890 --> 44:56.610]  purple, but has more of a chem dog sort of a smell. So that one's going to be an option. And
[44:56.610 --> 45:03.250]  there's one with no purple also are no purple at all, but tons of trichos, tons of trikes and a
[45:03.250 --> 45:09.730]  great chemi kind of funky, uh, cherry resin, he kind of smell. So those three or four females are
[45:09.730 --> 45:13.810]  going to get put in the room with the black cherry male, along with, I got a couple other girls that
[45:13.810 --> 45:16.610]  are going to go in there. I don't know if I even want to say what girls are going in there on the
[45:16.610 --> 45:22.450]  show. Cause I got some great strain ideas. I want to see what they do. Uh, there will be some
[45:22.450 --> 45:27.090]  new black cherry crosses coming up. Uh, then we'll have that breeding project won't happen until
[45:27.890 --> 45:32.210]  probably mid summer, maybe after the summer, summer, he kind of kills some ideas around here.
[45:32.210 --> 45:38.690]  Yeah. You got to shut down some things. Uh, right now I've got golden goat, a goal, a reversed golden
[45:38.690 --> 45:43.650]  goat male. It's a female that's now a male in a room with some lemon skunks. So there's more
[45:43.650 --> 45:48.050]  lemon Jeffrey being made. There's more golden goat seeds being made and I'm creating sunshine
[45:48.050 --> 45:53.410]  girl. And I've also put gorilla glue in there. So we'll have, yeah, gorilla glue, golden goat.
[45:53.410 --> 45:59.170]  We're going to need a name for that. And there's a, I don't even like don't get weed. That might
[45:59.170 --> 46:04.130]  be tough. Uh, golden. When I cross anything to golden goat, it makes it more resiny and gorilla
[46:04.130 --> 46:09.090]  glue is already resiny already. So it's going to be neat. But, uh, there's also a plant in there,
[46:09.090 --> 46:13.490]  a headband plant. And I think I've told this story before the last time I pollinated a headband
[46:13.490 --> 46:18.050]  plant. It died. It died. Yeah. So I put that bitch in there again. We're going to see what's up.
[46:18.050 --> 46:23.010]  Yeah. We're going to see if we just had a bad day or if it was fucking, yeah. If there's something
[46:23.010 --> 46:27.730]  to that, cause I don't know what I did last time. Every other plant was happy. She wasn't fucking
[46:27.730 --> 46:33.010]  with that last time. Take that Bukkake very well. Or no. And just shriveled up, shriveled up.
[46:33.570 --> 46:38.690]  Oh, you got any shout outs you want to give to anybody? Oh man. I'll put you on the spot. You're
[46:38.690 --> 46:43.970]  about to take a dab and I hit you up. No, I wasn't going to take a dab. Let's see. Shout out to Maddie.

[47:10.530 --> 47:15.170]  a horny toe, but he's a bearded, a bearded dragon. Dude. He looks like a dude. He looks like a
[47:15.170 --> 47:19.810]  dinosaur. When you guys got him, he was like micro size. Yeah. Like the size of the whole
[47:19.810 --> 47:23.570]  thing is from head to tail was the size of my thumb. And now he's like the length of my arm.

[47:41.730 --> 47:47.170]  but Earl is on point. He's got a picture of a booty in there. He'd be up there like scratching
[47:47.170 --> 47:52.050]  the booty. You guys have, uh, the garden of Weeden house is definitely one of the funnest
[47:52.050 --> 47:55.890]  places to hang out. You never know what's going to go on. It's chaotic, but they got the hookups
[47:55.890 --> 48:02.850]  there. It's all comfy and chill. Let's see. Uh, smokers club. Uh, we'll be doing a booth at the

[48:15.250 --> 48:18.690]  going to be mad at me. Cause I'm going to be out of seeds by the end of the first day of the game.
[48:19.250 --> 48:24.370]  So this is how it works. By the time I get to Denver, uh, I'll be there Friday and by the end
[48:24.370 --> 48:27.490]  of Friday night, I could be out of seats. I'm trying to buy one to the cup before the
[48:27.490 --> 48:31.250]  COVID starts. Yeah. Well, you're here now. Let's uh, let's talk in a minute.
[48:32.210 --> 48:36.850]  Got a box over here with some Irish stickers all over it. Guess what's in there. I do owe a big,
[48:36.850 --> 48:41.090]  huge shout out to green and healthy cannabis in Colorado spring is Colorado. If you're looking
[48:41.090 --> 48:46.370]  for the Turpex on the low, low cheap, man, they got the Durban poison wax. That is fire. If you're
[48:46.370 --> 48:49.250]  shouldn't even hype you up on that, because by the time you get there, that Durbin will be gone.
[48:49.250 --> 48:54.050]  They'll have some brand new shit. That'll be even better. Did he just tag us in some,
[48:54.050 --> 48:57.570]  he tags us in a lot of shit. Yeah. Cause they love us when the drop happened. Oh yeah. There

[50:10.050 --> 50:13.570]  And then I've got one pre-recorded and then I've got this one and then I'll have hunt.
[50:14.930 --> 50:18.770]  It's going to get fucking awesome here. I'll have shows coming out. Maybe I think the show I did
[50:18.770 --> 50:22.290]  last week, I'll put out on a Wednesday. We're going to have a Wednesday show this week or last
[50:22.290 --> 50:31.970]  week. Boom. Yeah. I watched this. Uh, have you seen a, like the Colbert report? Yeah. So there's
[50:31.970 --> 50:35.890]  one, I think it's Keaton Peel maybe, but he was doing like a black Colbert report and they were
[50:35.890 --> 50:40.450]  talking about Ferguson and it was fucking hilarious. It was probably one of the funniest
[50:40.450 --> 50:44.450]  shit. I won't, we ain't going to talk about it, but it was hilarious. You guys got to watch it.
[50:44.450 --> 50:51.410]  Also, uh, what's the guy's name? Bung Lao. Uh, just Google Buck Lao. Buck. I want to say
[50:51.410 --> 50:55.410]  bungalow cause uh, they're Joe, uh, Joe Coit as a character called bungalow. I think I got
[50:55.410 --> 51:01.650]  him confused, but uh, on YouTube type in Russell phone pranks. Um, I can't think of the fucking
[51:01.650 --> 51:06.370]  name of the show right now. Oh, we're going to Google it. Cause it's worth it. This guy deserves
[51:06.370 --> 51:12.050]  a huge shout out. He entertained me the other day. He is hell. Shout out to phone too. Cause
[51:12.770 --> 51:15.970]  phone is where I originate on my Asian voices from.
[51:17.810 --> 51:21.170]  Uh, all right. So what's going there? No, come on dude.
[51:23.650 --> 51:27.810]  Ownage pranks. That's what it's called. Ownage pranks. Yeah. Uh, this guy kills it.
[51:31.570 --> 51:35.650]  It's pretty good, dude. That's pretty good. So if you're bored, you got some time to kill,
[51:35.650 --> 51:40.210]  check out YouTube, check out ownage Frank's. Uh, any of the ones with Tyrone in them are fucking
[51:40.210 --> 51:44.530]  hilarious. It's all one guy doing all those voices. He calls people and harasses them,
[51:44.530 --> 51:48.610]  but he does call and apologize. So he's not a total dick, but that's my recommendation for
[51:48.610 --> 51:51.730]  the week. I've never done a recommendation for the week. I guess now that I've said that I'm
[51:51.730 --> 51:56.290]  going to have to recommend something every fucking week. Oops. I recommend a mother next week.
[51:57.010 --> 52:02.930]  And the week after that, uh, vector torches. And then the week after that, uh, root beer,
[52:02.930 --> 52:06.850]  root beer shit. Yeah. And then the week after that, we're going to go with the G nail from emo tech.
[52:07.810 --> 52:11.090]  That's plenty of recommendations. That should get shot out to emo tech. That should be long
[52:11.090 --> 52:15.490]  enough for you to forget. Hey, shout out. What's up, Giddy. Thanks for the email. I need one for
[52:15.490 --> 52:20.930]  my car, bro. Do you have one with like a power converter that plugs into the mini dash? Yeah.
[52:20.930 --> 52:24.930]  With a suction cup on it or something, some Velcro so we can Velcro that bitch to the dash.
[52:24.930 --> 52:30.930]  You got a radio attachment. Yeah. Cigarette lighter hookup. I'm about to do a dad. You guys,
[52:31.490 --> 52:35.010]  then we're going to wrap up the show. I'm going to try to do the closing part of the show right
[52:35.010 --> 52:38.930]  after this dog. I was a big chunky dad. Here we go. Say something interesting. Spence.
[52:40.850 --> 52:48.290]  Um, I'm not really an interesting person, but I'm nice with a carb cap though.
[52:50.610 --> 52:51.970]  Sometimes it's what I need from you.
[52:56.160 --> 52:59.600]  This guy likes to give me big, fat, nasty dad. He knows how I like it.
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.920]  I don't even like big dads. I think that's why I do it.
[53:01.920 --> 53:07.840]  Cause I don't like them. So I make other people do it. Oh yeah. Pop rocks in the brain. There we
[53:07.840 --> 53:12.960]  go. See, I remembered. Oh, my brain is sticky now. All right guys, we're going to wrap it up
[53:12.960 --> 53:17.200]  because I'm super duper high, like level 11. Don't worry. I'm going to be all right. I ain't
[53:17.200 --> 53:21.520]  going to fall over or nothing. I'm already in a chair. Nothing can go wrong. Oh, what do you
[53:21.520 --> 53:26.640]  recommend? Have you played with, have you played destiny? It seems to be what everybody's hooked on.
[53:26.640 --> 53:31.520]  It's not my thing. I think you like those sports games. Don't you? I like basketball,
[53:31.520 --> 53:38.480]  football, but recently I've been playing grand theft auto. Fuck shit. Five stars cruising.
[53:38.960 --> 53:42.640]  Hey Tony, if you have my grand theft auto five, let me get that. Let me get that back. Cause I
[53:42.640 --> 53:47.600]  just got inspired. Yup. You know, we can play on what, what do you have? I got an Xbox. Uh,
[53:47.600 --> 53:53.040]  then we can't be bros online. You should have the PlayStation clan. Spence kills it on the
[53:53.040 --> 53:56.080]  basketball game though. Nobody at the house can beat him. They're all pissed off at him. Every
[53:56.080 --> 54:01.360]  time I go over there. No, no, that's a lie. That is a lie. And then the football, football,
[54:01.360 --> 54:04.720]  the UFC one is fun to watch you guys play too. Cause I think someone's going to break
[54:04.720 --> 54:09.280]  a controller one day. I do have almost, I might find mine broke right now cause I was like,
[54:09.280 --> 54:13.360]  slammed it on the ground, man. I can't take smoke more weed. Don't get so stressed out
[54:13.360 --> 54:21.760]  over the video games, bro. All right. Yeah. End of the show right onto the garden of weed and
[54:21.760 --> 54:27.280]  crew for going to the gym every, uh, yeah. Shout out, shout out to the gym, um, the fitness.
[54:27.280 --> 54:30.320]  These guys have been killing it with their fitness. We'll talk about that on another episode.
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.040]  Um, next episode, let's talk about some health shit. Yeah. Yeah. We don't always have to talk
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.200]  about just weed. Cause this is part of our, uh, part of what we're doing to beer. I think taking
[54:39.200 --> 54:42.400]  good care of my plants has taught me to take better care of me. And I've said that before.
[54:43.600 --> 54:46.720]  All right, guys, thanks again for listening to another episode. We've gone on and on. We keep
[54:46.720 --> 54:49.920]  saying we're going to wrap it up, but we're at dab the fuck out and I can go as long as I want.
[54:49.920 --> 54:54.400]  Uh, I'll be back in a few more days. Uh, the next episode should be hunting the freaking
