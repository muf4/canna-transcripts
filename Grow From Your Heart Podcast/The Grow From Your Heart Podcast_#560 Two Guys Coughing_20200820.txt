[00:00.060 --> 00:13.660]  All right, here we go.
[00:13.660 --> 00:14.660]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:14.660 --> 00:15.660]  I'm your host.
[00:15.660 --> 00:20.500]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 560 of the grow from your heart
[00:20.500 --> 00:21.500]  podcast.
[00:21.500 --> 00:24.620]  If you're watching the video, I'm sure you can see that my buddy white Mike is joining
[00:24.620 --> 00:25.620]  us for another episode.
[00:25.620 --> 00:26.620]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:26.620 --> 00:27.620]  Thanks man.
[00:27.620 --> 00:28.620]  What's up everybody?
[00:28.620 --> 00:32.660]  Hey Mike, we usually start the show by talking about what we're smoking.
[00:32.660 --> 00:35.260]  So let's jump right into what you're smoking today.
[00:35.260 --> 00:37.260]  Diving right into it.
[00:37.260 --> 00:43.580]  We've got some Halo Live batter from our friends over at Green Dot Labs.
[00:43.580 --> 00:44.580]  Fancy.
[00:44.580 --> 00:49.660]  You can see how delicious that looks.
[00:49.660 --> 00:50.660]  How's it smell, brah?
[00:50.660 --> 00:51.660]  Wonderful.
[00:51.660 --> 00:52.660]  A little floral, a little spicy.
[00:52.660 --> 00:53.660]  It's just fantastic.
[00:53.660 --> 00:54.660]  I like everything about this.
[00:54.660 --> 00:55.660]  I've had some of the Halo.
[00:55.660 --> 00:56.660]  We've talked about it on the show.
[00:56.660 --> 00:57.660]  It is one of my favorites.
[00:57.660 --> 00:58.660]  Yeah, it's really good.
[00:58.660 --> 00:59.660]  I don't know.
[00:59.660 --> 01:00.660]  How would you describe the flavor?
[01:00.660 --> 01:01.660]  Well, I was trying to give you room to talk, but it's a lemony gas.
[01:01.660 --> 01:02.660]  Yeah, that's totally fair.
[01:02.660 --> 01:03.660]  Dish soap and diesel.
[01:03.660 --> 01:04.660]  A little bit.
[01:04.660 --> 01:05.660]  Yeah, a pleasant dish soap.
[01:05.660 --> 01:06.660]  A dish soap isn't probably a real pleasant description, but it's got that, there's a
[01:06.660 --> 01:07.660]  sweetness, a cilantro almost that comes through.
[01:07.660 --> 01:08.660]  Yeah.
[01:08.660 --> 01:09.660]  It's a little bit of a citrusy flavor.
[01:09.660 --> 01:10.660]  I like it.
[01:10.660 --> 01:11.660]  I like it.
[01:11.660 --> 01:12.660]  I like it.
[01:12.660 --> 01:13.660]  I like it.
[01:13.660 --> 01:14.660]  I like it.
[01:14.660 --> 01:15.660]  I like it.
[01:15.660 --> 01:16.660]  I like it.
[01:16.660 --> 01:17.660]  I like it.
[01:17.660 --> 01:18.660]  I like it.
[01:18.660 --> 01:19.660]  I like it.
[01:19.660 --> 01:20.660]  I like it.
[01:20.660 --> 01:21.660]  I like it.
[01:21.660 --> 01:22.660]  I like it.
[01:22.660 --> 01:23.660]  I like it.
[01:23.660 --> 01:24.660]  I like it.
[01:24.660 --> 01:25.660]  I like it.
[01:25.660 --> 01:26.660]  I like it.
[01:28.660 --> 01:29.660]  Yeah, cool.
[01:29.660 --> 01:30.660]  I'm glad you agree with that.
[01:30.660 --> 01:31.660]  It's nice and tasty.
[01:31.660 --> 01:32.660]  Really easy to work with and packs a punch on the dinner.
[01:32.660 --> 01:38.260]  Eventually they're going to call me and they're going to be like, hey, quit saying weird shit
[01:38.260 --> 01:39.260]  about our descriptions.
[01:39.260 --> 01:40.260]  You're really throwing people off here.
[01:40.260 --> 01:43.780]  Shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:43.780 --> 01:47.860]  Since you were kind enough to ask, I am smoking, I took a dab of a beautiful combo.
[01:47.860 --> 01:49.180]  I was kind of a smart ass here.
[01:49.180 --> 01:56.220]  I've got some banana sposter live batter and I've also got honey banana full spectrum extract.
[01:56.220 --> 01:58.660]  I wanted to go full banana on this bad bitch.
[01:58.660 --> 01:59.660]  So I took a little scoop.
[01:59.660 --> 02:03.180]  I took it like a three quarters of a normal size dab of both of them.
[02:03.180 --> 02:04.900]  So it was still bigger than a normal dab.
[02:04.900 --> 02:06.460]  I took a big chunky dab.
[02:06.460 --> 02:09.620]  It was a nice blend of the batter and the full spectrum extract.
[02:09.620 --> 02:11.060]  And bro, it was fucking bananas.
[02:11.060 --> 02:13.460]  That was a really nice dab.
[02:13.460 --> 02:19.620]  The one is described as the flavor is banana and sugar and oatmeal and the other is frosted
[02:19.620 --> 02:21.100]  banana pastry.
[02:21.100 --> 02:26.860]  It was like a banana runs candy or sometimes when I get those cheap, when I used to eat
[02:26.860 --> 02:30.420]  those like cheap like a zingers or something, they got a lot of vanilla flavor.
[02:30.420 --> 02:35.140]  It almost had that sort of a sweet vanilla banana pastry, the frosting, that cream cheese
[02:35.140 --> 02:36.140]  frosting on the top.
[02:36.140 --> 02:37.740]  It had that in there as well.
[02:37.740 --> 02:38.740]  Really good flavor.
[02:38.740 --> 02:39.740]  So that was a nice combo.
[02:39.740 --> 02:42.140]  I'm really glad I decided to do that.
[02:42.140 --> 02:45.420]  Also, it punched me right in the face.
[02:45.420 --> 02:46.980]  That combo was beautiful.
[02:46.980 --> 02:51.380]  Something about banana turps, banana OG, banana kush.
[02:51.380 --> 02:52.740]  There's something potent about that shit.
[02:52.740 --> 02:54.540]  I don't ever breed the banana stuff.
[02:54.540 --> 02:56.580]  There are people out there that are already doing that.
[02:56.580 --> 02:57.900]  I like the banana turps.
[02:57.900 --> 02:59.420]  They really work well for me.
[02:59.420 --> 03:00.420]  Nice.
[03:00.420 --> 03:03.060]  Yeah, they're not around enough and they're often overlooked and forgotten.
[03:03.060 --> 03:05.860]  I really don't think about banana turps until it's in front of me.
[03:05.860 --> 03:07.860]  And then I'm like, oh, I do want that.
[03:07.860 --> 03:10.180]  Like banana bread, bananas foster, honey banana.
[03:10.180 --> 03:11.980]  I always love the banana and we forget.
[03:11.980 --> 03:13.380]  So shout out to the banana turps.
[03:13.380 --> 03:16.380]  I've been enjoying a lot of honey banana stuff lately.
[03:16.780 --> 03:17.780]  I'm a fan.
[03:17.780 --> 03:20.580]  Concentrates or just other things in your world?
[03:20.580 --> 03:21.580]  Concentrates.
[03:21.580 --> 03:22.580]  Okay, I was wondering if you like more.
[03:22.580 --> 03:24.180]  I'm a banana concentrates, sorry.
[03:24.180 --> 03:26.780]  Yeah, they made a lot of that full spectrum extract.
[03:26.780 --> 03:30.580]  And I bought a lot of it at that dispensary down near where we live.
[03:30.580 --> 03:33.380]  So I've been enjoying the shit out of that.
[03:33.380 --> 03:35.780]  I had some from Apothecary and some from Green Dot.
[03:35.780 --> 03:37.980]  It was fun to bounce it back and forth.
[03:37.980 --> 03:39.380]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[03:39.380 --> 03:40.780]  It's always nice having variety.
[03:40.780 --> 03:42.180]  Variety is the spice of life.
[03:42.180 --> 03:44.380]  And the two companies make their products.
[03:44.380 --> 03:47.580]  It's the same extraction methods basically, but it's like art.
[03:47.580 --> 03:49.980]  Their SOPs are just this much different possibly.
[03:49.980 --> 03:50.580]  I don't know.
[03:50.580 --> 03:53.580]  But I mean, if one of them does something just a little bit different,
[03:53.580 --> 03:55.580]  the product comes out so vastly different.
[03:55.580 --> 03:57.380]  And I love that availability here.
[03:57.380 --> 03:57.780]  Love it.
[03:57.780 --> 03:58.380]  Love it.
[03:58.380 --> 03:59.980]  Awesome.
[03:59.980 --> 04:03.780]  Mike, this is the point of the show where we should pay some bills and do some shout outs.

[05:06.180 --> 05:09.780]  When I read that name, I could just see somebody holding one of those little watering cans,
[05:09.780 --> 05:12.980]  like the old school watering can with the big thing on the end so it spreads,
[05:12.980 --> 05:15.980]  and they got their overalls, and they're just fucking staring at the plant going,
[05:15.980 --> 05:16.980]  Grow For Me, Dammit.
[05:16.980 --> 05:17.780]  That's the name I like.
[05:17.780 --> 05:21.180]  Elmer Fudd, instead of the shotgun, I see you out there with the watering can.
[05:21.180 --> 05:23.980]  That's completely what I see when I read the name, Grow For Me, Dammit.
[05:23.980 --> 05:26.180]  Just out there like staring at the plant.
[05:26.180 --> 05:27.180]  Give it some time, bro.
[05:27.180 --> 05:28.380]  It'll grow for you, Dammit.
[05:28.380 --> 05:29.180]  Good luck out there.

[05:39.380 --> 05:40.980]  Big shout out if you're listening.
[05:40.980 --> 05:41.980]  Yet.
[05:41.980 --> 05:44.580]  Every grow's got a couple of crazy hands, and I love you guys.

[06:01.780 --> 06:03.380]  I hope you're the good Canna Reaper.
[06:03.380 --> 06:05.780]  Let's move forward with the big shout out to Ned Denver.

[06:28.380 --> 06:30.980]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out to Rasta K.
[06:30.980 --> 06:32.780]  Anybody named Rasta K gets my love.

[07:17.980 --> 07:20.780]  I pulled up so I could do just that man.

[07:51.180 --> 07:53.980]  This guy trusts me a lot and it means a lot.
[07:53.980 --> 07:55.780]  So we've got the Patreons covered.
[07:55.780 --> 07:59.580]  We got Seeds Here Now covered.
[07:59.580 --> 08:02.580]  Mike, you got anything you want to ramble about or should we jump right into these Patreon
[08:02.580 --> 08:05.980]  questions and cover some business?
[08:05.980 --> 08:07.780]  Let's jump right into the first email, man.
[08:07.780 --> 08:07.980]  All right.
[08:07.980 --> 08:10.580]  I want to leave you plenty of space.
[08:10.580 --> 08:11.980]  No, no, no, no, no, let's not.
[08:11.980 --> 08:15.580]  I was just about to pass you the fucking ramble pass.
[08:15.580 --> 08:16.580]  You've got the hall pass.
[08:16.580 --> 08:19.180]  If you've got something on your white mic mind, I want to hear it, bro.
[08:19.180 --> 08:20.580]  So don't be shy.
[08:20.580 --> 08:22.380]  You got something you want to side rant on?
[08:22.380 --> 08:23.380]  Fucking that's what you're here for.
[08:23.380 --> 08:25.580]  That's what the people love.
[08:25.580 --> 08:28.580]  Concentrate's been stellar in Colorado lately, man.
[08:28.580 --> 08:31.580]  I've had so much good product in front of me lately.
[08:31.580 --> 08:33.180]  It's just been fun.
[08:33.180 --> 08:37.580]  It's helping make COVID a hell of a lot easier to handle.
[08:37.580 --> 08:40.180]  Yeah, I don't get to go to comedy shows.
[08:40.180 --> 08:40.980]  That's awesome.
[08:40.980 --> 08:43.180]  I can vamp on that all day.
[08:43.180 --> 08:45.980]  Take a dab if you'd like to, but I understand your stance on camera.
[08:45.980 --> 08:47.780]  If you need to turn your camera off, take a dab, bro.
[08:47.780 --> 08:49.980]  We won't laugh at you.
[08:49.980 --> 08:52.980]  I'm going to totally vamp on what you're saying because I love this topic.
[08:52.980 --> 08:55.180]  I don't go to comedy shows anymore.
[08:55.180 --> 08:57.380]  There aren't comedy shows to go to.
[08:57.380 --> 08:59.980]  My favorite things to do are comedy shows and concerts,
[08:59.980 --> 09:02.980]  and those are the first things that we cannot do right now.
[09:02.980 --> 09:05.980]  So I'm kind of going stir crazy in my mind.
[09:05.980 --> 09:08.380]  I love being out with the people and fucking laughing.
[09:08.380 --> 09:11.580]  Laughter, you guys, if you listen to the show from the beginning,
[09:11.580 --> 09:12.580]  I've talked about comedy.
[09:12.580 --> 09:14.980]  I've tapered it off because I feel like I'm rubbing it in a little bit.
[09:14.980 --> 09:18.180]  People don't care too much about every fucking comedy show I go to,
[09:18.180 --> 09:21.180]  but I've made friends with the people at the comedy clubs.
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.780]  I've made friends with comedians.
[09:22.780 --> 09:25.380]  I go to a lot of, so my point is I'm not doing that anymore.
[09:25.380 --> 09:30.380]  I'm going fucking stir crazy and I can only buy so much clothes and shoes online.
[09:30.380 --> 09:32.580]  Like it feels good to have a package show up every day,
[09:32.580 --> 09:34.580]  but now I don't get to wear that shit anywhere.
[09:34.580 --> 09:36.780]  I got a new pair of shoes for every day of the fucking month.
[09:36.780 --> 09:38.180]  I got new pants for every day of the month.
[09:38.180 --> 09:40.780]  I got a fresh new shirt for every episode of the show.
[09:40.780 --> 09:41.980]  That's the only thing I'm wearing it on.
[09:41.980 --> 09:45.380]  I got new shoes on right now just because I can't fucking wear them anywhere.
[09:45.380 --> 09:46.380]  Like, yo.
[09:46.380 --> 09:48.380]  And the other thing I'm blowing all my money on, bro,
[09:48.380 --> 09:50.980]  since we're not going to shows is all these delicious concentrates.
[09:50.980 --> 09:52.180]  And you're right.
[09:52.380 --> 09:55.580]  Whoever is stuck in the lab all day is just cranking it out.
[09:55.580 --> 09:57.180]  They're like, oh, I'm bored.
[09:57.180 --> 09:58.380]  I don't want to go out and get COVID.
[09:58.380 --> 10:00.580]  Let's make a bunch of fresh new flavors.
[10:00.580 --> 10:01.780]  Yeah, you're looking like me now.
[10:01.780 --> 10:02.780]  I'm not going to lift up mine.
[10:02.780 --> 10:06.380]  It's just, it's so much fun right now in Colorado.
[10:06.380 --> 10:09.580]  Like I feel for people in other places.
[10:09.580 --> 10:12.580]  Like I don't know how the fuck people in Arkansas are handling this shit.
[10:12.580 --> 10:16.380]  Like the further you are from legalization, man, just.
[10:16.380 --> 10:17.780]  Moonshine, buddy. Moonshine.
[10:17.780 --> 10:19.980]  That's how they're doing it in Arkansas.
[10:19.980 --> 10:21.980]  Just guessing. Sorry, guys.
[10:23.180 --> 10:24.180]  It's just brutal.
[10:24.180 --> 10:24.980]  I feel for y'all.
[10:24.980 --> 10:26.180]  I really, really do.
[10:26.180 --> 10:27.180]  I really do.
[10:27.180 --> 10:32.180]  I don't think I could do this without really good herb.
[10:32.180 --> 10:33.180]  No, I would.
[10:33.180 --> 10:35.780]  I'd have lost it already.
[10:35.780 --> 10:37.380]  I was getting a throat tickle.
[10:37.380 --> 10:40.980]  And I know that the first thing I need to do when I start getting a throat tickle
[10:40.980 --> 10:43.580]  is hydrate and minimize my consumption of smoke.
[10:43.580 --> 10:45.980]  Like just dabs and hot smoke over the throat.
[10:45.980 --> 10:49.180]  I did a 36-hour stretch without taking a dab.
[10:49.180 --> 10:51.580]  And a couple of people that were close to me, they're like,
[10:51.780 --> 10:53.180]  you haven't dabbed all day.
[10:53.180 --> 10:53.780]  Are you okay?
[10:53.780 --> 10:55.980]  And I was like, I feel fucking good, but I feel weird.
[10:55.980 --> 10:57.580]  Like I really would like to dab.
[10:57.580 --> 11:01.580]  And when I did finally take that dab, bro, it was like a good kick to the fucking dick.
[11:01.580 --> 11:02.380]  I got so lit.
[11:02.380 --> 11:03.580]  It was really nice.
[11:03.580 --> 11:05.980]  But yeah, I started getting that like, I'm bored.
[11:05.980 --> 11:07.180]  I can't go anywhere.
[11:07.180 --> 11:07.980]  I'm not into sit.
[11:07.980 --> 11:08.580]  I can't.
[11:08.580 --> 11:10.780]  If you know me, you know I can't sit there and watch TV.
[11:10.780 --> 11:13.380]  I can't shut the fuck up long enough to watch a commercial.
[11:13.380 --> 11:15.580]  So not like I'm just bouncing around with nothing.
[11:15.580 --> 11:17.780]  Now my backup plan is to get dabbed and chill out.
[11:17.780 --> 11:19.380]  And I can't do that for 36 hours.
[11:19.380 --> 11:20.780]  I was kind of like fidgety.
[11:20.980 --> 11:23.380]  So yeah, these dabs keep us kind of calm down.
[11:23.380 --> 11:26.580]  Another thing though, bro, you know what I really stepped up my game on?
[11:26.580 --> 11:29.380]  And my garden looks even better.
[11:29.980 --> 11:30.580]  Does it?
[11:30.580 --> 11:33.980]  Yeah, my grow looks fucking, it's sexy right now.
[11:33.980 --> 11:36.580]  Everything is right on track where I want it to be.
[11:36.580 --> 11:38.780]  The plants look the way I want them to look.
[11:38.780 --> 11:41.180]  Like everything is where I expect it to be.
[11:41.180 --> 11:44.580]  That, you know, that corner, you don't grow because you got the kids and all that.
[11:44.580 --> 11:47.380]  But you've worked in commercial grows and you know, there's always one corner.
[11:47.380 --> 11:48.380]  There's always a corner.
[11:48.380 --> 11:50.980]  Needs to be swept and he's just clean that fucking corner out.
[11:50.980 --> 11:52.180]  That corner got cleaned.
[11:52.180 --> 11:53.580]  Like it got, it's clean.
[11:53.580 --> 11:55.580]  COVID took away all the excuses.
[11:55.580 --> 11:56.180]  Yeah.
[11:56.580 --> 12:01.780]  I mean, there's always, there's always something else you could be doing or should be doing or need to do.
[12:02.180 --> 12:06.980]  And so it's easy to put off the whatever can absolutely wait till tomorrow.
[12:06.980 --> 12:08.380]  You can take it down the road a little bit.
[12:08.380 --> 12:10.780]  But COVID took all those fucking excuses away.
[12:10.780 --> 12:12.980]  If you're not at work, you're at home.
[12:13.380 --> 12:17.580]  Yeah, and that's, that's part of what sucks about COVID is enough the phone rings and you press ignore.
[12:17.580 --> 12:19.780]  You're basically just saying, fuck you to whoever called us.
[12:19.780 --> 12:20.780]  They know you're home.
[12:21.180 --> 12:21.980]  You're not doing shit.
[12:21.980 --> 12:22.780]  It's COVID time.
[12:22.780 --> 12:24.180]  I know that motherfucker ain't busy.
[12:24.180 --> 12:28.980]  Yeah, he's fucking just sitting there on the couch scrolling, looking for new shoes online or I've got the good excuse.
[12:28.980 --> 12:29.980]  I was recording.
[12:29.980 --> 12:32.180]  I had the phone turned off and I was recording a podcast.
[12:32.180 --> 12:33.380]  I wasn't able to get to you.
[12:33.980 --> 12:34.180]  Right.
[12:34.180 --> 12:40.980]  I've got the, we built a COVID garden of three raised flower beds out back that all veggies.
[12:40.980 --> 12:42.980]  I got a big bed full of corn.
[12:43.380 --> 12:48.180]  I got a bed full of squash and zucchini, a bed full of peas, bed full of broccoli.
[12:48.180 --> 12:49.580]  When does the corn come up bro?
[12:49.580 --> 12:52.580]  Because the zucchini and squash was so good.
[12:53.780 --> 12:56.980]  Dude, the squash and zucchini are kicking out like mad right now.
[12:56.980 --> 13:00.180]  The peas just started to really sprout.
[13:02.180 --> 13:04.580]  The corn here should be in a couple of weeks.
[13:04.580 --> 13:07.980]  It's really, it's starting to look like it's getting ready to.
[13:08.180 --> 13:09.980]  It's just been going up so far.
[13:09.980 --> 13:12.380]  No flowers as it were.
[13:13.180 --> 13:13.980]  You can see it.
[13:14.780 --> 13:16.580]  It's crushing it.
[13:16.580 --> 13:19.380]  We got like stupid lucky with the dirt or some shit.
[13:20.380 --> 13:24.380]  So many veggies, but that's helped fill a lot of COVID hours too.
[13:24.580 --> 13:29.180]  Yeah, you delivered me a nice basket of veggies bro, and they were delicious.
[13:29.180 --> 13:31.180]  I couldn't eat all of that shit yet.
[13:31.180 --> 13:38.580]  You gave me so much that I still haven't eaten it, but I chopped some of it into like little diced cubes and cooked it up with some vegetable oil and put a little seasoning on it.
[13:38.580 --> 13:43.180]  Serve that next to a warm sour to it next to a cold salad is a nice little contrast and compliment.
[13:43.180 --> 13:44.180]  It was really good bro.
[13:44.180 --> 13:47.180]  Yeah, some corn next to that will be killing it.
[13:47.180 --> 13:54.180]  We've been doing fried zucchini, like little sauteed zucchini, getting ready to try the zucchini bread.
[13:54.180 --> 13:56.980]  You're going to be zucchini the fuck out pretty soon.
[13:56.980 --> 14:00.180]  Every time we do a garden dude, we get way too much zucchini.
[14:00.180 --> 14:02.580]  You can't under plant that.
[14:02.580 --> 14:06.780]  Like even if you only put three seeds in the ground, you're going to end up with a hundred pounds of zucchini.
[14:06.980 --> 14:07.980]  Hell yeah.
[14:07.980 --> 14:08.980]  Hell yeah.
[14:08.980 --> 14:14.980]  And you're not even like farmer John, you're a fucking heavy white guy and you're out there just gardening bro.
[14:14.980 --> 14:15.980]  That's awesome.
[14:15.980 --> 14:16.980]  Yup.
[14:16.980 --> 14:20.980]  My wife really wanted it this spring.
[14:20.980 --> 14:24.980]  She was like, if we're going to really going to be trapped in the house all summer, we got to have stuff to do.
[14:24.980 --> 14:26.980]  So let's do a garden.
[14:26.980 --> 14:29.980]  And it was a lot of work getting them prepped and getting them in.
[14:29.980 --> 14:33.980]  But the watering system we built has just been kicking all kinds of ass.
[14:33.980 --> 14:35.980]  Tell us about your watering system bro.
[14:36.180 --> 14:38.180]  That's a thing to talk about on a cannabis podcast.
[14:38.180 --> 14:47.180]  So with cannabis, the drip systems that you and I built, usually each plant gets its own special dripper.
[14:47.180 --> 14:54.180]  And that leads to a lot of fucking headaches just because you got to check each one of them little tips every goddamn day.
[14:54.180 --> 14:59.180]  With the system we built for my garden, like it's just veggies.
[14:59.180 --> 15:04.180]  Each piece, each corn stock doesn't need to get the same amount of water every day.
[15:04.380 --> 15:06.380]  You just need to saturate the soil there.
[15:06.380 --> 15:16.380]  So we've just got big emitters like you'd put for a yard or a flower bed or something in the corners of the boxes.
[15:16.380 --> 15:18.380]  And we didn't even do all four corners.
[15:18.380 --> 15:23.380]  We did on the two square boxes, I've got diagonals.
[15:23.380 --> 15:27.380]  So like one in the front right and one in the back left.
[15:27.580 --> 15:36.580]  And then on the long rectangle box, I've got two corners on one side and a big 180 shooting in the middle on the other side.
[15:36.580 --> 15:39.580]  And it seems to be covering everything 100%.
[15:39.580 --> 15:43.580]  The amount of veggies we're getting out of this thing is fucking ridiculous dude.
[15:43.580 --> 15:45.580]  They taste good. They were really sweet.
[15:45.580 --> 15:52.580]  I've got like nine yellow squash in my kitchen right now that we've harvested over the last couple days
[15:52.580 --> 15:54.580]  that we haven't managed to eat or give away.
[15:54.780 --> 15:57.780]  And we're harvesting six or seven more tomorrow.
[15:57.780 --> 16:00.780]  Yeah, dude. I love them.
[16:00.780 --> 16:02.780]  This is off season we got at Home Depot.
[16:02.780 --> 16:04.780]  It's not even special stuff.
[16:04.780 --> 16:06.780]  Thank God we did it, dude.
[16:06.780 --> 16:09.780]  I was saying you're not even Farmer John out there.
[16:09.780 --> 16:12.780]  You're just some normal dude that doesn't really have like, you know,
[16:12.780 --> 16:15.780]  you're not fucking licking your finger and checking the wind and shit every day.
[16:15.780 --> 16:17.780]  And just out there doing what you know how to do.
[16:17.780 --> 16:23.780]  I fire up my morning coffee and while I'm drinking my morning coffee, I go stare at it like I'm doing stuff.
[16:23.980 --> 16:26.980]  It just gets me away from the kids while I get half a cup of coffee in me.
[16:26.980 --> 16:30.980]  And then I get out there with the kids for like half an hour in the evening.
[16:30.980 --> 16:33.980]  And we pull weeds and pick veggies that are ready.
[16:33.980 --> 16:36.980]  And it's a great little time killer.
[16:36.980 --> 16:38.980]  That's a cool experience for the kids too.
[16:38.980 --> 16:41.980]  They're bringing food in from their yard that they grew that you guys made
[16:41.980 --> 16:42.980]  and then they get to have it for dinner.
[16:42.980 --> 16:43.980]  Yep.
[16:43.980 --> 16:45.980]  You get to see a process.
[16:45.980 --> 16:48.980]  They actually get to do it in their, like I'm gigantic people.
[16:48.980 --> 16:50.980]  I'm 6'3", 250 pounds.
[16:51.180 --> 16:53.180]  If I'm being nice.
[16:53.180 --> 16:55.180]  I let you have it, bro.
[16:55.180 --> 17:00.180]  I can't squeeze through some of the corn and shit or like tiptoe through some of the stuff.
[17:00.180 --> 17:02.180]  And they can, they're tiny.
[17:02.180 --> 17:04.180]  So that's been really helpful too.
[17:04.180 --> 17:06.180]  Like I've got little tiny helper bots.
[17:06.180 --> 17:11.180]  Little bots, little useful oompa loompas.
[17:13.180 --> 17:15.180]  Yeah, I think I do want some dab, buddy.
[17:15.180 --> 17:16.180]  I'm pretty rambly already.
[17:16.180 --> 17:17.180]  No, it's perfect, bro.
[17:17.180 --> 17:19.180]  I kind of was hoping that we could kind of turn it into a ramble cast.
[17:19.380 --> 17:21.380]  They do and it's been pretty intensive lately.
[17:21.380 --> 17:24.380]  Everything has just been fucking lesson, lesson, learn, learn.
[17:24.380 --> 17:25.380]  And it's been intense.
[17:25.380 --> 17:26.380]  I'm going to hit a dab.
[17:26.380 --> 17:27.380]  The last couple of shows have been really good.
[17:27.380 --> 17:28.380]  You talk for like seven seconds.
[17:28.380 --> 17:30.380]  I'll take a dab and then I'll cover you.
[17:30.380 --> 17:31.380]  Sounds good to me.
[17:31.380 --> 17:33.380]  I'll wait on the heat and that then.
[17:33.380 --> 17:38.380]  So I really liked the last couple of episodes on safety.
[17:40.380 --> 17:43.380]  A lot of the cannabis forums I've been reading lately,
[17:43.580 --> 17:49.580]  you can tell that people haven't thought all the way through their grow setup.
[17:49.580 --> 17:53.580]  So they've thought about, I want to grow cannabis.
[17:53.580 --> 17:56.580]  And they've thought about maybe where they're going to get the seeds
[17:56.580 --> 17:58.580]  or which light they're going to use.
[17:58.580 --> 18:04.580]  But they haven't thought about all of the steps all the way to the end.
[18:04.580 --> 18:09.580]  So they haven't thought about planting or transplanting or cloning,
[18:09.780 --> 18:15.780]  harvesting, which hours of the day they're going to run their lights.
[18:15.780 --> 18:17.780]  I mean, during the summer right now,
[18:17.780 --> 18:21.780]  I saw like 130 in Death Valley might be a world record.
[18:21.780 --> 18:24.780]  Vegas right now is breaking all kinds of records.
[18:24.780 --> 18:28.780]  Like if you're running your grow lights during the day right now,
[18:28.780 --> 18:30.780]  like, oh Lordy, you're fighting yourself.
[18:30.780 --> 18:32.780]  142 degrees in your grow?
[18:32.780 --> 18:35.780]  A lot of people don't think to,
[18:35.980 --> 18:39.980]  wait, I can just run them from night to morning.
[18:39.980 --> 18:40.980]  Like plant don't give a fuck.
[18:40.980 --> 18:42.980]  Like it don't have to be to work the next day.
[18:42.980 --> 18:45.980]  You can run it on whatever schedule you want.
[18:45.980 --> 18:50.980]  And just learn, taking the time to really think through all the steps.
[18:50.980 --> 18:52.980]  Especially drying here.
[18:52.980 --> 18:57.980]  I know so many people that, I mean, you spend a ton of money on good equipment
[18:57.980 --> 18:59.980]  and good grow lights and good nutrients.
[18:59.980 --> 19:02.980]  And you invest all the time to get your plant to harvest.
[19:03.180 --> 19:06.180]  And then they throw it in a cardboard box or stick it in an oven.
[19:06.180 --> 19:09.180]  Like how many times have we seen that, bro?
[19:09.180 --> 19:10.180]  Oh yeah.
[19:10.180 --> 19:12.180]  We used to run a shop.
[19:12.180 --> 19:14.180]  So we got everybody bringing everything to us.
[19:14.180 --> 19:16.180]  And they would tell us what they did.
[19:16.180 --> 19:18.180]  They thought they were cool by doing dumb tricks.
[19:18.180 --> 19:20.180]  Yep. Everybody. Yeah.
[19:20.180 --> 19:23.180]  It's a little different this time.
[19:23.180 --> 19:24.180]  Oh, why?
[19:24.180 --> 19:26.180]  Because we set it on the door of the oven
[19:26.180 --> 19:28.180]  and turn the oven on 400 for three hours
[19:28.180 --> 19:30.180]  instead of letting it dry and cure for two.
[19:30.180 --> 19:31.180]  Yeah. I can't remember that kid's name.
[19:31.180 --> 19:32.180]  Oh, I do remember his name.
[19:32.380 --> 19:33.380]  I remember his dad's name now.
[19:34.380 --> 19:36.380]  That was the LA Confidential, right?
[19:36.380 --> 19:39.380]  Let's not go, let's not have too many details, but yes.
[19:39.380 --> 19:40.380]  Oh, but that was the strain, right?
[19:40.380 --> 19:41.380]  Yeah.
[19:41.380 --> 19:42.380]  We're thinking of the same kid?
[19:42.380 --> 19:43.380]  Same family. Yep.
[19:43.380 --> 19:45.380]  And that was from 10, 12 years ago.
[19:45.380 --> 19:46.380]  Yeah. Yeah.
[19:46.380 --> 19:47.380]  Yeah.
[19:47.380 --> 19:49.380]  And we still remember this pound of ruined weed.
[19:51.380 --> 19:53.380]  Yeah, the safety episode.
[19:53.380 --> 19:55.380]  Mike, honestly, that safety episode came from
[19:55.380 --> 19:58.380]  working in multiple commercial facilities.
[19:58.380 --> 19:59.380]  You know my history in commercial grows.
[19:59.380 --> 20:00.380]  I've been in enough.
[20:00.380 --> 20:01.380]  I've managed a few.
[20:01.580 --> 20:02.580]  I've been a grunt in a few.
[20:02.580 --> 20:04.580]  I've consulted for countless.
[20:04.580 --> 20:07.580]  There was a comment on YouTube
[20:07.580 --> 20:10.580]  about somebody bending over with scissors in their pocket.
[20:10.580 --> 20:12.580]  And I spit, like I spit a little soda out
[20:12.580 --> 20:13.580]  when I read that.
[20:13.580 --> 20:16.580]  Because I've driven that kid to the hospital twice.
[20:16.580 --> 20:18.580]  Not the kid that made the comment,
[20:18.580 --> 20:21.580]  but some younger person working for me
[20:21.580 --> 20:23.580]  who puts scissors in their damn pocket,
[20:23.580 --> 20:24.580]  forgot about it,
[20:24.580 --> 20:27.580]  and stabbed themselves half an hour later with them.
[20:27.580 --> 20:30.580]  And that's how I put that episode together, basically.
[20:30.780 --> 20:31.780]  I've seen the shit.
[20:31.780 --> 20:32.780]  I've been in countless grows
[20:32.780 --> 20:34.780]  around countless growers.
[20:34.780 --> 20:36.780]  And I've seen hungover people.
[20:36.780 --> 20:37.780]  I've seen stoned people.
[20:37.780 --> 20:39.780]  I've seen sober people in a hurry.
[20:39.780 --> 20:41.780]  I've seen people clearing wood chippers
[20:41.780 --> 20:42.780]  with broom handles.
[20:42.780 --> 20:44.780]  I'm looking at broom handles.
[20:45.780 --> 20:47.780]  I've seen a lot of crazy shit.
[20:47.780 --> 20:48.780]  So that's how I know
[20:48.780 --> 20:49.780]  you're going to cut yourself.
[20:49.780 --> 20:50.780]  You're going to stub your toe.
[20:50.780 --> 20:51.780]  You're going to fucking
[20:51.780 --> 20:53.780]  spray a chemical in your eye one day.
[20:53.780 --> 20:54.780]  You're going to fucking...
[20:54.780 --> 20:57.780]  You ever see two guys hold a 2x6
[20:57.780 --> 20:59.780]  and another guy walk on the 2x6
[20:59.980 --> 21:00.980]  to change a light bulb?
[21:02.980 --> 21:03.980]  Because we have...
[21:03.980 --> 21:05.980]  You ever seen a guy put a ladder
[21:05.980 --> 21:06.980]  on a scissor lift
[21:06.980 --> 21:07.980]  and raise the scissor lift
[21:07.980 --> 21:08.980]  to get up high enough
[21:08.980 --> 21:10.980]  to get to that fucking light?
[21:10.980 --> 21:12.980]  Because we did.
[21:13.980 --> 21:14.980]  Yeah, man.
[21:14.980 --> 21:16.980]  We've seen and done a lot of crazy shit
[21:16.980 --> 21:17.980]  that we probably shouldn't even admit
[21:17.980 --> 21:18.980]  to having seen or done
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.980]  in a commercial environment.
[21:20.980 --> 21:21.980]  Come in in the morning
[21:21.980 --> 21:23.980]  and the 300-pound carbon filter
[21:23.980 --> 21:25.980]  is smashed on the floor
[21:25.980 --> 21:27.980]  15 feet below where it was hanging
[21:28.180 --> 21:30.180]  when you left the vet last night.
[21:30.180 --> 21:32.180]  Big old ring of carbon around it
[21:32.180 --> 21:33.180]  and fucking like 12 plants
[21:33.180 --> 21:35.180]  in a tray just smashed.
[21:35.180 --> 21:36.180]  Yeah, we...
[21:36.180 --> 21:37.180]  Yeah.
[21:37.180 --> 21:39.180]  Snakes in light shields.
[21:39.180 --> 21:41.180]  Because we've seen a thing or two.
[21:41.180 --> 21:43.180]  Birds in fucking exhaust fans.
[21:44.180 --> 21:45.180]  Squirrels eating...
[21:45.180 --> 21:46.180]  I was wondering
[21:46.180 --> 21:47.180]  if you were going to mention
[21:47.180 --> 21:48.180]  your finger in the fan
[21:48.180 --> 21:49.180]  on that episode.
[21:49.180 --> 21:50.180]  Yeah, I think I did.
[21:50.180 --> 21:51.180]  This episode's about safety.
[21:51.180 --> 21:52.180]  I was like,
[21:52.180 --> 21:53.180]  oh, he's going to tell the finger story.
[21:53.180 --> 21:54.180]  You made me think about something
[21:54.180 --> 21:55.180]  I wanted to add
[21:55.180 --> 21:56.180]  to the safety episode
[21:56.180 --> 21:57.180]  and it just totally fucking left my head
[21:57.380 --> 21:58.380]  because there were so many
[21:58.380 --> 21:59.380]  good thoughts happening
[21:59.380 --> 22:00.380]  that it may come to me.
[22:00.380 --> 22:01.380]  Or maybe I'll just watch
[22:01.380 --> 22:02.380]  this episode and rethink about it.
[22:02.380 --> 22:03.380]  Something that happens
[22:03.380 --> 22:04.380]  in fucking random grows.
[22:04.380 --> 22:05.380]  But yeah,
[22:05.380 --> 22:07.380]  we've had some crazy shit happen, dude.
[22:07.380 --> 22:09.380]  The squirrel that chewed
[22:09.380 --> 22:11.380]  on the fucking big cable outside
[22:11.380 --> 22:12.380]  and killed the power
[22:12.380 --> 22:13.380]  to the whole fucking building
[22:13.380 --> 22:14.380]  and we went outside
[22:14.380 --> 22:15.380]  and found a squirrel
[22:15.380 --> 22:16.380]  that was as stiff
[22:16.380 --> 22:17.380]  as my fucking Bic pen.
[22:17.380 --> 22:19.380]  Like from head to toe,
[22:19.380 --> 22:20.380]  that squirrel was barbecued
[22:20.380 --> 22:21.380]  and just stiff.
[22:21.380 --> 22:22.380]  Like,
[22:22.380 --> 22:24.380]  yeah, we've seen some weird shit.
[22:24.380 --> 22:25.380]  The rattlesnakes.
[22:25.380 --> 22:26.380]  We had a great episode
[22:26.580 --> 22:27.580]  that we had to grow
[22:28.580 --> 22:30.580]  fucking 15 minutes from here
[22:30.580 --> 22:31.580]  where we found
[22:31.580 --> 22:33.580]  multiple fucking rattlesnakes outside.
[22:33.580 --> 22:34.580]  I had another grow
[22:34.580 --> 22:35.580]  where we found tarantulas inside.
[22:36.580 --> 22:37.580]  It's a bunch of crazy shit
[22:37.580 --> 22:38.580]  used to happen
[22:38.580 --> 22:39.580]  at some of these commercial grows.
[22:39.580 --> 22:40.580]  Lizards inside?
[22:40.580 --> 22:41.580]  Lizards was common.
[22:41.580 --> 22:42.580]  Yeah, lizards.
[22:42.580 --> 22:43.580]  They didn't even bother anybody
[22:43.580 --> 22:44.580]  after a while.
[22:44.580 --> 22:45.580]  Yeah, there's another lizard.
[22:45.580 --> 22:46.580]  Just run them outside.
[22:46.580 --> 22:48.580]  What happens when this CO2 tank
[22:48.580 --> 22:49.580]  that's
[22:50.580 --> 22:52.580]  like eight feet tall
[22:52.580 --> 22:54.580]  blows a seal
[22:54.580 --> 22:55.580]  and dumps
[22:55.780 --> 22:57.780]  your whole new CO2 delivery
[22:57.780 --> 22:58.780]  out
[22:58.780 --> 23:00.780]  in like an hour?
[23:03.780 --> 23:05.780]  I can walk it outside one day
[23:05.780 --> 23:06.780]  and I'm
[23:06.780 --> 23:08.780]  at the front of a long building.
[23:08.780 --> 23:10.780]  The building's half a city block.
[23:10.780 --> 23:12.780]  And I'm in the front of the building
[23:12.780 --> 23:13.780]  and I hear
[23:13.780 --> 23:14.780]  pshhhhhh.
[23:16.780 --> 23:17.780]  And I go, that's a curious sound
[23:17.780 --> 23:18.780]  and I start walking towards it
[23:18.780 --> 23:19.780]  and it gets louder
[23:19.780 --> 23:20.780]  and louder
[23:20.780 --> 23:21.780]  and louder
[23:21.780 --> 23:22.780]  and louder
[23:22.780 --> 23:23.780]  and at a certain point
[23:23.780 --> 23:24.780]  I can't hear anymore
[23:24.980 --> 23:25.980]  because it's so oppressive
[23:25.980 --> 23:26.980]  it's blocking out other sounds.
[23:26.980 --> 23:28.980]  I can walk it around
[23:28.980 --> 23:29.980]  and there's this nice fog
[23:29.980 --> 23:30.980]  emitting
[23:30.980 --> 23:32.980]  from the back of the building.
[23:34.980 --> 23:35.980]  Yeah.
[23:35.980 --> 23:36.980]  Is money
[23:36.980 --> 23:37.980]  flying out of that canister?
[23:37.980 --> 23:38.980]  It's hard to guess.
[23:38.980 --> 23:39.980]  It's so hard to plan
[23:39.980 --> 23:40.980]  for all the shit
[23:40.980 --> 23:41.980]  you're going to run into
[23:41.980 --> 23:42.980]  when you grow cannabis.
[23:42.980 --> 23:43.980]  Yeah, well then
[23:43.980 --> 23:44.980]  what happened that day was
[23:44.980 --> 23:46.980]  so we have big canisters
[23:46.980 --> 23:47.980]  outside of the building
[23:47.980 --> 23:48.980]  and a truck comes up
[23:48.980 --> 23:49.980]  and hooks up a line
[23:49.980 --> 23:50.980]  and fills
[23:50.980 --> 23:51.980]  those canisters
[23:51.980 --> 23:52.980]  with CO2
[23:52.980 --> 23:53.980]  so we don't have to move
[23:54.180 --> 23:55.180]  those canisters all the time.
[23:56.180 --> 23:57.180]  The machine
[23:57.180 --> 23:58.180]  Was it 10 days worth of CO2?
[23:58.180 --> 23:59.180]  Should have been 10 or 14 days.
[23:59.180 --> 24:00.180]  The guy fell asleep
[24:00.180 --> 24:01.180]  in his truck, bro
[24:01.180 --> 24:02.180]  and he froze the line
[24:02.180 --> 24:03.180]  because CO2 is a cold gas
[24:03.180 --> 24:04.180]  that froze the lines
[24:04.180 --> 24:05.180]  and it didn't stop
[24:05.180 --> 24:06.180]  so when he disconnected
[24:06.180 --> 24:07.180]  everything was frozen.
[24:07.180 --> 24:08.180]  It also froze the lines
[24:08.180 --> 24:09.180]  inside the grow
[24:09.180 --> 24:10.180]  and it was just
[24:10.180 --> 24:11.180]  spitting CO2
[24:11.180 --> 24:12.180]  in all the grow rooms
[24:12.180 --> 24:13.180]  at a ridiculous rate.
[24:13.180 --> 24:14.180]  Yeah, the alarms
[24:14.180 --> 24:15.180]  went off in the building.
[24:15.180 --> 24:16.180]  We had to evacuate
[24:16.180 --> 24:17.180]  the building and shit.
[24:17.180 --> 24:18.180]  Yup.
[24:18.180 --> 24:19.180]  Yeah, that was
[24:19.180 --> 24:20.180]  pretty ridiculous.
[24:20.180 --> 24:21.180]  Yup.
[24:21.180 --> 24:22.180]  I've seen
[24:22.180 --> 24:23.180]  one of those
[24:23.380 --> 24:25.380]  I've seen walls collapse
[24:25.380 --> 24:26.380]  Wow
[24:26.380 --> 24:27.380]  because people
[24:27.380 --> 24:28.380]  put up too much weight
[24:28.380 --> 24:29.380]  and it was just
[24:29.380 --> 24:30.380]  a cheap little
[24:30.380 --> 24:31.380]  cardboard or
[24:31.380 --> 24:32.380]  not cardboard
[24:32.380 --> 24:33.380]  drywall
[24:33.380 --> 24:34.380]  over plywood
[24:34.380 --> 24:35.380]  so
[24:35.380 --> 24:36.380]  it's just
[24:36.380 --> 24:37.380]  you never know
[24:37.380 --> 24:38.380]  what you're going to run into folks.
[24:38.380 --> 24:39.380]  Safety first
[24:39.380 --> 24:40.380]  then teamwork.
[24:40.380 --> 24:41.380]  Don't put fucking scissors
[24:41.380 --> 24:42.380]  in your pocket.
[24:42.380 --> 24:43.380]  Yeah, right.
[24:43.380 --> 24:44.380]  Don't put scissors
[24:44.380 --> 24:45.380]  in your pocket.
[24:45.380 --> 24:46.380]  Yeah.
[24:46.380 --> 24:47.380]  I've taken plenty
[24:47.380 --> 24:48.380]  of people to
[24:48.380 --> 24:49.380]  the emergency room
[24:49.380 --> 24:50.380]  for dumb,
[24:50.380 --> 24:51.380]  dumb things.
[24:51.380 --> 24:52.380]  Pesticide exposure
[24:52.580 --> 24:53.580]  was my least favorite
[24:53.580 --> 24:54.580]  to go to the hospital for
[24:54.580 --> 24:55.580]  because every time
[24:55.580 --> 24:56.580]  you walk in
[24:56.580 --> 24:57.580]  you're like
[24:57.580 --> 24:58.580]  I've got
[24:58.580 --> 24:59.580]  I'm a manager
[24:59.580 --> 25:00.580]  at a cultivation facility
[25:00.580 --> 25:01.580]  and this employee
[25:01.580 --> 25:02.580]  has a pesticide exposure.
[25:02.580 --> 25:03.580]  Like something goes off
[25:03.580 --> 25:04.580]  in everybody
[25:04.580 --> 25:05.580]  that's like
[25:05.580 --> 25:06.580]  we need to contaminate you
[25:06.580 --> 25:07.580]  and we're always like
[25:07.580 --> 25:08.580]  no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[25:08.580 --> 25:09.580]  We need to contaminate you.
[25:09.580 --> 25:10.580]  This was yesterday
[25:10.580 --> 25:11.580]  like we all
[25:11.580 --> 25:12.580]  have always got to explain
[25:12.580 --> 25:13.580]  like he got hit yesterday
[25:13.580 --> 25:14.580]  with the pesticides
[25:14.580 --> 25:15.580]  he sees a rash today
[25:15.580 --> 25:16.580]  we're fine.
[25:16.580 --> 25:17.580]  I wasn't even in the room
[25:17.580 --> 25:18.580]  he's the only sprayer
[25:18.580 --> 25:19.580]  we're not contaminated
[25:19.580 --> 25:20.580]  I always have to talk fast
[25:20.580 --> 25:21.580]  to get a satisfactory
[25:21.780 --> 25:22.780]  to get us out of that one.
[25:22.780 --> 25:23.780]  Yup.
[25:23.780 --> 25:24.780]  Like yeah
[25:24.780 --> 25:25.780]  if one of the Grotex went
[25:25.780 --> 25:26.780]  and just went by themselves
[25:26.780 --> 25:27.780]  and said it
[25:27.780 --> 25:28.780]  I think they'd probably
[25:28.780 --> 25:29.780]  end up in a decon unit
[25:29.780 --> 25:30.780]  fucking lockdown and shit.
[25:30.780 --> 25:31.780]  Yeah.
[25:31.780 --> 25:32.780]  Yeah, but I've seen
[25:32.780 --> 25:33.780]  too many of our friends
[25:33.780 --> 25:34.780]  get steroid shots
[25:34.780 --> 25:35.780]  and fucking
[25:35.780 --> 25:36.780]  what's that pill called
[25:36.780 --> 25:37.780]  that they give you
[25:37.780 --> 25:38.780]  Claritin
[25:38.780 --> 25:39.780]  or the other one
[25:39.780 --> 25:40.780]  when you're all
[25:40.780 --> 25:41.780]  yeah, they give you
[25:41.780 --> 25:42.780]  a steroid shot
[25:42.780 --> 25:43.780]  some Claritin or whatever
[25:43.780 --> 25:44.780]  and they go
[25:44.780 --> 25:45.780]  good luck.
[25:45.780 --> 25:46.780]  Fuck dude
[25:46.780 --> 25:47.780]  look like a tiger
[25:47.780 --> 25:48.780]  on one side.
[25:48.780 --> 25:49.780]  Right, the tiger stripe
[25:49.780 --> 25:50.780]  rash is no joke
[25:50.980 --> 25:51.980]  first time you see that
[25:51.980 --> 25:52.980]  you freak the fuck out.
[25:52.980 --> 25:53.980]  Yeah.
[25:53.980 --> 25:54.980]  Yeah.
[25:54.980 --> 25:55.980]  Second time you see that
[25:55.980 --> 25:56.980]  you freak out too.
[25:56.980 --> 25:57.980]  That's when it starts like
[25:57.980 --> 25:59.980]  the tiger stripes
[25:59.980 --> 26:00.980]  get ridges that start bleeding
[26:00.980 --> 26:01.980]  that's when you're like
[26:01.980 --> 26:02.980]  ah fuck
[26:02.980 --> 26:03.980]  ah fuck
[26:03.980 --> 26:04.980]  I've never had that
[26:04.980 --> 26:05.980]  but I've seen it.
[26:05.980 --> 26:06.980]  Yeah.
[26:06.980 --> 26:07.980]  We had a guy
[26:07.980 --> 26:08.980]  I don't know how much
[26:08.980 --> 26:09.980]  we're allowed to talk about this
[26:09.980 --> 26:10.980]  because of HIPAA and all that shit
[26:10.980 --> 26:11.980]  but in one case
[26:11.980 --> 26:12.980]  I saw a person
[26:12.980 --> 26:13.980]  where I was a doctor
[26:13.980 --> 26:14.980]  yeah, that's true
[26:14.980 --> 26:15.980]  but I saw a person
[26:15.980 --> 26:16.980]  get exposed to a pesticide rash
[26:16.980 --> 26:17.980]  and like
[26:17.980 --> 26:18.980]  he messaged me that
[26:18.980 --> 26:19.980]  each time
[26:20.180 --> 26:21.180]  he messaged me that evening
[26:21.180 --> 26:22.180]  he's like
[26:22.180 --> 26:23.180]  hey bro I think it worked today
[26:23.180 --> 26:24.180]  I may have got something
[26:24.180 --> 26:25.180]  he sent me
[26:25.180 --> 26:26.180]  a picture
[26:26.180 --> 26:27.180]  a little red spot on his skin
[26:27.180 --> 26:28.180]  and I said bro
[26:28.180 --> 26:29.180]  document that
[26:29.180 --> 26:30.180]  keep an eye on it
[26:30.180 --> 26:31.180]  we'll check on it in the morning at work
[26:31.180 --> 26:32.180]  I checked on him as soon as we got to work
[26:32.180 --> 26:33.180]  let me see your little rash bro
[26:33.180 --> 26:34.180]  and it was like starting to
[26:34.180 --> 26:35.180]  he was
[26:35.180 --> 26:36.180]  he's dark skinned
[26:36.180 --> 26:37.180]  and it was starting to turn
[26:37.180 --> 26:38.180]  even darker than him
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.180]  and I was like
[26:39.180 --> 26:40.180]  that doesn't look good buddy
[26:40.180 --> 26:41.180]  we're gonna have to check on that
[26:41.180 --> 26:42.180]  at the first break
[26:42.180 --> 26:43.180]  at the first break
[26:43.180 --> 26:44.180]  it had started growing
[26:44.180 --> 26:45.180]  like up his rib cage and shit
[26:45.180 --> 26:46.180]  and I was like
[26:46.180 --> 26:47.180]  yeah
[26:47.180 --> 26:48.180]  I think by lunch
[26:48.180 --> 26:49.180]  we're taking you to the hospital
[26:49.380 --> 26:50.380]  and we're gonna take a marker
[26:50.380 --> 26:51.380]  and draw around the outside of it
[26:51.380 --> 26:52.380]  there was no
[26:52.380 --> 26:53.380]  need for the marker
[26:53.380 --> 26:54.380]  because by lunch
[26:54.380 --> 26:55.380]  fucking from his
[26:55.380 --> 26:56.380]  yep
[26:56.380 --> 26:57.380]  kneecap to his collarbone
[26:57.380 --> 26:58.380]  he looked like
[26:58.380 --> 26:59.380]  somebody had clawed him
[26:59.380 --> 27:00.380]  or something
[27:00.380 --> 27:01.380]  and the doctor said
[27:01.380 --> 27:02.380]  that that
[27:02.380 --> 27:03.380]  pesticide that he was exposed to
[27:03.380 --> 27:04.380]  was
[27:04.380 --> 27:05.380]  heat activated
[27:05.380 --> 27:06.380]  the heat in his body
[27:06.380 --> 27:07.380]  was making him get a worse rash
[27:07.380 --> 27:08.380]  and
[27:08.380 --> 27:09.380]  we were working on a grow
[27:09.380 --> 27:10.380]  and we wore long sleeves and shit
[27:10.380 --> 27:11.380]  so he was definitely getting
[27:11.380 --> 27:12.380]  yep
[27:12.380 --> 27:13.380]  but
[27:13.380 --> 27:14.380]  yeah so he got a funkia
[27:14.380 --> 27:15.380]  and it just happened
[27:15.380 --> 27:16.380]  within 12
[27:16.380 --> 27:17.380]  24 hours
[27:17.380 --> 27:18.380]  it went from
[27:18.580 --> 27:19.580]  he got some
[27:19.580 --> 27:20.580]  got a boo boo from some
[27:20.580 --> 27:21.580]  pesticides to
[27:21.580 --> 27:22.580]  oh fuck
[27:22.580 --> 27:23.580]  get in the car
[27:23.580 --> 27:24.580]  we are taking you to the hospital bro
[27:24.580 --> 27:25.580]  like
[27:25.580 --> 27:26.580]  yep
[27:26.580 --> 27:27.580]  yeah
[27:27.580 --> 27:28.580]  they gave him
[27:28.580 --> 27:29.580]  whatever that pill is
[27:29.580 --> 27:30.580]  Claritin
[27:30.580 --> 27:31.580]  or that doesn't sound right
[27:31.580 --> 27:32.580]  but they gave him something like that
[27:32.580 --> 27:33.580]  and some steroids
[27:33.580 --> 27:34.580]  and told him
[27:34.580 --> 27:35.580]  good luck buddy
[27:35.580 --> 27:36.580]  yeah the eye wash
[27:36.580 --> 27:37.580]  was a really good
[27:37.580 --> 27:38.580]  really good
[27:38.580 --> 27:39.580]  tip to
[27:39.580 --> 27:40.580]  the
[27:40.580 --> 27:41.580]  the really common
[27:41.580 --> 27:42.580]  that I saw
[27:42.580 --> 27:43.580]  is you
[27:43.580 --> 27:44.580]  you take a
[27:44.580 --> 27:45.580]  a dirty trichome coated finger
[27:45.580 --> 27:46.580]  and stick it in your eye
[27:46.580 --> 27:47.580]  oh god
[27:47.780 --> 27:48.780]  and then the next thing you know
[27:48.780 --> 27:49.780]  new trimmers
[27:49.780 --> 27:50.780]  in the side of the room
[27:50.780 --> 27:51.780]  crying a little bit
[27:51.780 --> 27:52.780]  and it's like what happened
[27:52.780 --> 27:53.780]  oh you touched your eye
[27:55.780 --> 27:56.780]  another thing I've seen
[27:56.780 --> 27:57.780]  people make mistakes on
[27:57.780 --> 27:58.780]  and this is what I forgot
[27:58.780 --> 27:59.780]  a moment ago
[27:59.780 --> 28:00.780]  so I'm gonna interrupt you
[28:00.780 --> 28:01.780]  and just fucking blast this one out
[28:01.780 --> 28:02.780]  don't do it
[28:02.780 --> 28:03.780]  is
[28:03.780 --> 28:04.780]  and this is common
[28:04.780 --> 28:05.780]  in a commercial grow
[28:05.780 --> 28:06.780]  and it's a bad mistake
[28:06.780 --> 28:07.780]  and it's also illegal
[28:07.780 --> 28:08.780]  it's illegal by the health department
[28:08.780 --> 28:09.780]  it's illegal by the department of ag
[28:09.780 --> 28:11.780]  keep your beverages
[28:11.780 --> 28:12.780]  away from your
[28:12.780 --> 28:13.780]  other
[28:13.780 --> 28:14.780]  stuffs
[28:14.780 --> 28:15.780]  yep
[28:15.780 --> 28:16.780]  like
[28:16.980 --> 28:17.980]  it's not uncommon
[28:17.980 --> 28:18.980]  to have
[28:18.980 --> 28:19.980]  isopropyl alcohol
[28:19.980 --> 28:20.980]  yeah
[28:20.980 --> 28:21.980]  we'd have
[28:21.980 --> 28:22.980]  isopropyl alcohol
[28:22.980 --> 28:23.980]  ph up
[28:23.980 --> 28:24.980]  ph down

[28:29.980 --> 28:30.980]  and you're fucking going

[28:47.180 --> 28:48.180]  like it was funny
[28:48.180 --> 28:49.180]  and I need a drink of this kombucha
[28:49.180 --> 28:50.180]  cause I just
[28:50.180 --> 28:51.180]  Pavlov'd my mouth
[28:51.180 --> 28:52.180]  we were soaking
[28:52.180 --> 28:53.180]  those spray emitters
[28:53.180 --> 28:54.180]  I mentioned a while back
[28:54.180 --> 28:55.180]  the clog easy
[28:55.180 --> 28:56.180]  we were soaking those
[28:56.180 --> 28:57.180]  in a caustic cleaner
[28:57.180 --> 28:58.180]  and someone
[28:58.180 --> 28:59.180]  who wasn't typically
[28:59.180 --> 29:00.180]  in that part of the grow
[29:00.180 --> 29:01.180]  came by
[29:01.180 --> 29:02.180]  and moved
[29:02.180 --> 29:03.180]  they were looking for something
[29:03.180 --> 29:04.180]  and they moved
[29:04.180 --> 29:05.180]  the
[29:05.180 --> 29:06.180]  the
[29:06.180 --> 29:07.180]  container
[29:07.180 --> 29:08.180]  that those were soaking
[29:08.180 --> 29:09.180]  in and it didn't have a lid
[29:09.180 --> 29:10.180]  it just had a
[29:10.180 --> 29:11.180]  I think it was a piece
[29:11.180 --> 29:12.180]  of paper
[29:12.180 --> 29:13.180]  that was in the container
[29:13.180 --> 29:14.180]  and it was a piece of paper
[29:14.180 --> 29:15.180]  that was in the container
[29:15.380 --> 29:16.380]  I think it was a piece of tape
[29:16.380 --> 29:17.380]  over the top
[29:17.380 --> 29:18.380]  that said
[29:18.380 --> 29:19.380]  you know don't touch
[29:19.380 --> 29:20.380]  yeah it said what it was on
[29:20.380 --> 29:21.380]  it actually said what it was
[29:21.380 --> 29:22.380]  cause I remember this
[29:22.380 --> 29:23.380]  very well
[29:23.380 --> 29:24.380]  and I know exactly
[29:24.380 --> 29:25.380]  the person that day
[29:25.380 --> 29:26.380]  they splashed it on their hand
[29:26.380 --> 29:27.380]  and ended up with a chemical burn
[29:29.380 --> 29:30.380]  and yeah
[29:30.380 --> 29:31.380]  like five minutes later
[29:31.380 --> 29:32.380]  they came up to us
[29:32.380 --> 29:33.380]  and were like
[29:33.380 --> 29:34.380]  why is my hand
[29:34.380 --> 29:35.380]  like red and itchy
[29:35.380 --> 29:36.380]  to the right now
[29:36.380 --> 29:37.380]  why is it stinging
[29:37.380 --> 29:38.380]  it was actually zero tall
[29:38.380 --> 29:39.380]  and their hand was turning
[29:39.380 --> 29:40.380]  white and puffy
[29:40.380 --> 29:41.380]  and the skin was kind of
[29:41.380 --> 29:42.380]  dying a little bit
[29:42.380 --> 29:43.380]  see Jeff was there
[29:43.380 --> 29:44.380]  I remember exactly
[29:44.580 --> 29:45.580]  that day and that person
[29:45.580 --> 29:46.580]  cause they tried to
[29:46.580 --> 29:47.580]  they were like
[29:47.580 --> 29:48.580]  what do I do
[29:48.580 --> 29:49.580]  and I was like
[29:49.580 --> 29:50.580]  don't fuck around
[29:50.580 --> 29:51.580]  cause they were fucking around
[29:51.580 --> 29:52.580]  is why they got hurt
[29:52.580 --> 29:53.580]  that's
[29:53.580 --> 29:54.580]  yep
[29:54.580 --> 29:55.580]  don't fuck around
[29:55.580 --> 29:56.580]  yeah
[29:56.580 --> 29:57.580]  so yeah
[29:57.580 --> 29:58.580]  you had to quick
[29:58.580 --> 29:59.580]  get it treated
[29:59.580 --> 30:00.580]  and yeah
[30:00.580 --> 30:01.580]  see I knew what it was
[30:01.580 --> 30:02.580]  immediately
[30:02.580 --> 30:03.580]  when I saw
[30:03.580 --> 30:04.580]  the skin reaction
[30:04.580 --> 30:05.580]  I knew what it was
[30:05.580 --> 30:06.580]  immediately
[30:06.580 --> 30:07.580]  it was like
[30:07.580 --> 30:08.580]  you got zero tall on you
[30:08.580 --> 30:09.580]  and I bet it came from that
[30:09.580 --> 30:10.580]  like it was just
[30:10.580 --> 30:11.580]  that's part of being the boss
[30:11.580 --> 30:12.580]  you know what's going on
[30:12.580 --> 30:13.580]  in the building
[30:13.780 --> 30:14.780]  and your
[30:14.780 --> 30:15.780]  chemicals and shit
[30:15.780 --> 30:16.780]  separate
[30:16.780 --> 30:17.780]  and have a plan
[30:17.780 --> 30:18.780]  don't get costa chemicals
[30:18.780 --> 30:19.780]  in your fucking fingers
[30:19.780 --> 30:20.780]  if you got more than one
[30:20.780 --> 30:21.780]  person working there
[30:21.780 --> 30:22.780]  like in your home grow
[30:22.780 --> 30:23.780]  it's probably just you
[30:23.780 --> 30:24.780]  but in a commercial facility
[30:24.780 --> 30:25.780]  or if you got a homie
[30:25.780 --> 30:26.780]  backing you up
[30:26.780 --> 30:27.780]  label shit
[30:27.780 --> 30:28.780]  so that
[30:28.780 --> 30:29.780]  like they know
[30:29.780 --> 30:30.780]  that there is
[30:30.780 --> 30:31.780]  zero tall
[30:31.780 --> 30:32.780]  in this cup
[30:32.780 --> 30:33.780]  because we're cleaning
[30:33.780 --> 30:34.780]  these emitters
[30:34.780 --> 30:35.780]  like make
[30:35.780 --> 30:36.780]  make that shit known
[30:36.780 --> 30:37.780]  like mark stuff
[30:37.780 --> 30:38.780]  I like to keep a big
[30:38.780 --> 30:39.780]  dry erase board
[30:39.780 --> 30:40.780]  and every cultivation
[30:40.780 --> 30:41.780]  every room
[30:41.780 --> 30:42.780]  has a dedicated
[30:42.980 --> 30:43.980]  this room needs to be
[30:43.980 --> 30:44.980]  defoliated
[30:44.980 --> 30:45.980]  by the end of the day
[30:45.980 --> 30:46.980]  Michael do it
[30:46.980 --> 30:47.980]  mark his initials
[30:47.980 --> 30:48.980]  and if I don't like
[30:48.980 --> 30:49.980]  the way it's defoliated
[30:49.980 --> 30:50.980]  I know to go
[30:50.980 --> 30:51.980]  cuss Mike out for it
[30:51.980 --> 30:52.980]  it's
[30:52.980 --> 30:53.980]  when you were talking
[30:53.980 --> 30:54.980]  about that on the
[30:54.980 --> 30:55.980]  the episode
[30:55.980 --> 30:56.980]  I was thinking
[30:56.980 --> 30:57.980]  how nice it is
[30:57.980 --> 30:58.980]  that we can do that
[30:58.980 --> 30:59.980]  in legal land now
[30:59.980 --> 31:00.980]  that used to be like
[31:00.980 --> 31:01.980]  the one of the top
[31:01.980 --> 31:02.980]  five tips
[31:02.980 --> 31:03.980]  for being a grower
[31:03.980 --> 31:04.980]  during prohibition times
[31:04.980 --> 31:05.980]  was
[31:05.980 --> 31:06.980]  don't keep
[31:06.980 --> 31:07.980]  like if you keep records
[31:07.980 --> 31:08.980]  make it in code
[31:08.980 --> 31:09.980]  don't make it obvious
[31:09.980 --> 31:10.980]  because
[31:10.980 --> 31:11.980]  your notes
[31:12.180 --> 31:13.180]  are evidence
[31:13.180 --> 31:14.180]  yep
[31:14.180 --> 31:15.180]  and yeah
[31:15.180 --> 31:16.180]  now it's
[31:16.180 --> 31:17.180]  there's
[31:17.180 --> 31:18.180]  a lot less of that
[31:18.180 --> 31:19.180]  worry in Colorado
[31:19.180 --> 31:20.180]  we can just
[31:20.180 --> 31:21.180]  have a big whiteboard
[31:21.180 --> 31:22.180]  have SOPs
[31:22.180 --> 31:23.180]  have logs
[31:23.180 --> 31:24.180]  all that shit
[31:24.180 --> 31:25.180]  makes life so
[31:25.180 --> 31:26.180]  much easier
[31:26.180 --> 31:27.180]  and a lot safer
[31:27.180 --> 31:28.180]  so much
[31:28.180 --> 31:29.180]  yeah
[31:29.180 --> 31:30.180]  call it SOPs
[31:30.180 --> 31:31.180]  are one of my
[31:31.180 --> 31:32.180]  at first I was
[31:32.180 --> 31:33.180]  afraid of
[31:33.180 --> 31:34.180]  or intimidated
[31:34.180 --> 31:35.180]  or whatever
[31:35.180 --> 31:36.180]  turned off
[31:36.180 --> 31:37.180]  by SOPs
[31:37.180 --> 31:38.180]  and now I love
[31:38.180 --> 31:39.180]  a good SOP
[31:39.180 --> 31:40.180]  like it's kind of
[31:40.180 --> 31:41.180]  something in me
[31:41.380 --> 31:42.380]  like if you want to pay me
[31:42.380 --> 31:43.380]  to write you SOPs
[31:43.380 --> 31:44.380]  like oh yeah
[31:44.380 --> 31:45.380]  that's like one of my
[31:45.380 --> 31:46.380]  favorite things to do
[31:46.380 --> 31:47.380]  let me come look at your
[31:47.380 --> 31:48.380]  building
[31:48.380 --> 31:49.380]  look at what you got
[31:49.380 --> 31:50.380]  we'll write
[31:50.380 --> 31:51.380]  fucking from walking in
[31:51.380 --> 31:52.380]  and washing our hands
[31:52.380 --> 31:53.380]  we'll write an SOP
[31:53.380 --> 31:54.380]  from using the time clock
[31:54.380 --> 31:55.380]  all the way to clocking out
[31:55.380 --> 31:56.380]  I'll get you fucking
[31:56.380 --> 31:57.380]  programmed with SOPs
[31:57.380 --> 31:58.380]  I love that shit
[31:58.380 --> 31:59.380]  it cracks me up
[31:59.380 --> 32:00.380]  I've had more than one
[32:00.380 --> 32:01.380]  outfit
[32:01.380 --> 32:02.380]  that pay me to help
[32:02.380 --> 32:03.380]  tweak theirs
[32:03.380 --> 32:04.380]  and then
[32:04.380 --> 32:05.380]  six months later
[32:05.380 --> 32:06.380]  I come back
[32:06.380 --> 32:07.380]  to
[32:07.380 --> 32:08.380]  do a follow up
[32:08.380 --> 32:09.380]  and they're not
[32:09.380 --> 32:10.380]  following any of it
[32:10.580 --> 32:11.580]  they can't figure out
[32:11.580 --> 32:12.580]  why shit's not better
[32:12.580 --> 32:13.580]  and it's like
[32:13.580 --> 32:14.580]  well have you tried
[32:14.580 --> 32:15.580]  following the steps
[32:15.580 --> 32:16.580]  and it's all new employees
[32:16.580 --> 32:17.580]  that weren't there before
[32:17.580 --> 32:18.580]  and so you show
[32:18.580 --> 32:19.580]  that new staff
[32:19.580 --> 32:20.580]  the actual SOPs
[32:20.580 --> 32:21.580]  you pull them out
[32:21.580 --> 32:22.580]  you pull up the file
[32:22.580 --> 32:23.580]  and you go
[32:23.580 --> 32:24.580]  have you ever read
[32:24.580 --> 32:25.580]  this
[32:25.580 --> 32:26.580]  and they go
[32:26.580 --> 32:27.580]  oh that's such a good idea
[32:27.580 --> 32:28.580]  and you come back
[32:28.580 --> 32:29.580]  in like three days
[32:29.580 --> 32:30.580]  and like yeah
[32:30.580 --> 32:31.580]  the trimmers are faster
[32:31.580 --> 32:32.580]  the fucking weight room
[32:32.580 --> 32:33.580]  is faster
[32:33.580 --> 32:34.580]  the quality control
[32:34.580 --> 32:35.580]  is faster
[32:35.580 --> 32:36.580]  everything seems to be
[32:36.580 --> 32:37.580]  smoother here
[32:37.580 --> 32:38.580]  I don't know what happened
[32:38.580 --> 32:39.580]  like yeah
[32:39.780 --> 32:40.780]  sometimes it looks like
[32:40.780 --> 32:41.780]  the lead grower
[32:41.780 --> 32:42.780]  is just losing his mind
[32:42.780 --> 32:43.780]  standing there
[32:43.780 --> 32:44.780]  staring at the plants
[32:44.780 --> 32:45.780]  and looking off into space
[32:45.780 --> 32:46.780]  but we've got SOPs
[32:46.780 --> 32:47.780]  and shit in our brain
[32:47.780 --> 32:48.780]  and we're like
[32:48.780 --> 32:49.780]  oh man
[32:49.780 --> 32:50.780]  we're gonna have to
[32:50.780 --> 32:51.780]  fucking do these next
[32:51.780 --> 32:52.780]  seven fucking steps
[32:52.780 --> 32:53.780]  because we already know
[32:53.780 --> 32:54.780]  like we got the map
[32:54.780 --> 32:55.780]  in our head
[32:55.780 --> 32:56.780]  sometimes we just get
[32:56.780 --> 32:57.780]  that weird
[32:57.780 --> 32:58.780]  weird fucking look
[32:58.780 --> 32:59.780]  right
[32:59.780 --> 33:00.780]  I don't envy that part
[33:00.780 --> 33:01.780]  of the
[33:01.780 --> 33:02.780]  part of the grow
[33:02.780 --> 33:03.780]  I like my end
[33:03.780 --> 33:04.780]  and I don't care
[33:04.780 --> 33:05.780]  for your end of the grow
[33:05.780 --> 33:06.780]  so that's beautiful
[33:06.780 --> 33:07.780]  and I don't care
[33:07.780 --> 33:08.780]  for your end of the grow
[33:08.980 --> 33:09.980]  so that's beautiful
[33:09.980 --> 33:10.980]  you want to talk about
[33:10.980 --> 33:11.980]  metric
[33:11.980 --> 33:12.980]  before we even tell them
[33:12.980 --> 33:13.980]  what it is
[33:13.980 --> 33:14.980]  yeah
[33:14.980 --> 33:15.980]  tell me in three words
[33:15.980 --> 33:16.980]  explain to me
[33:16.980 --> 33:17.980]  how you feel about
[33:17.980 --> 33:18.980]  metric
[33:18.980 --> 33:19.980]  and then we'll tell them
[33:19.980 --> 33:20.980]  what it is after that
[33:20.980 --> 33:21.980]  fuck that spinning wheel
[33:21.980 --> 33:22.980]  I think that was more
[33:22.980 --> 33:23.980]  than two words
[33:23.980 --> 33:24.980]  too many words
[33:24.980 --> 33:25.980]  but that's gonna be
[33:25.980 --> 33:26.980]  the general consensus
[33:26.980 --> 33:27.980]  for anybody
[33:27.980 --> 33:28.980]  who has to deal
[33:28.980 --> 33:29.980]  with metric
[33:29.980 --> 33:30.980]  fuck that spinning wheel
[33:30.980 --> 33:31.980]  metric is the
[33:31.980 --> 33:32.980]  marijuana enforcement
[33:32.980 --> 33:33.980]  tracking blah blah blah
[33:33.980 --> 33:34.980]  system
[33:34.980 --> 33:35.980]  it's the
[33:35.980 --> 33:36.980]  yeah the
[33:36.980 --> 33:37.980]  software system
[33:38.180 --> 33:39.180]  and it can be
[33:40.180 --> 33:41.180]  like I get why
[33:41.180 --> 33:42.180]  it exists
[33:42.180 --> 33:43.180]  but it
[33:45.180 --> 33:46.180]  it is what it is
[33:47.180 --> 33:48.180]  I don't want them
[33:48.180 --> 33:49.180]  to come after me
[33:49.180 --> 33:50.180]  I don't work in the MED
[33:50.180 --> 33:51.180]  anymore
[33:51.180 --> 33:52.180]  I don't work
[33:52.180 --> 33:53.180]  with metric
[33:53.180 --> 33:54.180]  I mean I work in the MED
[33:54.180 --> 33:55.180]  but I don't work with metric
[33:55.180 --> 33:56.180]  I work in the back end
[33:56.180 --> 33:57.180]  so I don't really have to talk to them
[33:57.180 --> 33:58.180]  I hand you a clipboard
[33:58.180 --> 33:59.180]  and you do all that
[33:59.180 --> 34:00.180]  metric shit for me
[34:00.180 --> 34:01.180]  thank you bro
[34:01.180 --> 34:02.180]  that fucking program
[34:02.180 --> 34:03.180]  sucks and needs some
[34:03.180 --> 34:04.180]  fucking updates
[34:04.180 --> 34:05.180]  and it's the biggest
[34:05.180 --> 34:06.180]  waste of time
[34:06.180 --> 34:07.180]  in people's days
[34:07.380 --> 34:08.380]  good program
[34:08.380 --> 34:09.380]  when it works
[34:09.380 --> 34:10.380]  the idea
[34:10.380 --> 34:11.380]  the goal
[34:11.380 --> 34:12.380]  the fucking purpose
[34:12.380 --> 34:13.380]  is fucking awesome
[34:13.380 --> 34:14.380]  execution
[34:14.380 --> 34:15.380]  thumbs down
[34:15.380 --> 34:16.380]  zero
[34:16.380 --> 34:17.380]  fuck that fucking service
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.380]  dude
[34:18.380 --> 34:19.380]  Mike said
[34:19.380 --> 34:20.380]  fuck that spinning wheel
[34:20.380 --> 34:21.380]  everybody's first question
[34:21.380 --> 34:22.380]  when they get into metric
[34:22.380 --> 34:23.380]  is it supposed to
[34:23.380 --> 34:24.380]  randomly eat a
[34:24.380 --> 34:25.380]  30 a day
[34:25.380 --> 34:26.380]  yeah apparently
[34:26.380 --> 34:27.380]  that's not a bug
[34:27.380 --> 34:28.380]  that's a feature
[34:28.380 --> 34:29.380]  yeah
[34:29.380 --> 34:30.380]  anytime we cut a clone
[34:30.380 --> 34:31.380]  not transplant
[34:31.380 --> 34:32.380]  but move a plant
[34:32.380 --> 34:33.380]  from another room
[34:33.380 --> 34:34.380]  anything that really
[34:34.380 --> 34:35.380]  happens
[34:35.380 --> 34:36.380]  I don't know
[34:36.380 --> 34:37.380]  anything that really
[34:37.380 --> 34:39.380]  happens with plant relocation
[34:39.380 --> 34:40.380]  recreation
[34:40.380 --> 34:41.380]  from the time you cut the clone
[34:41.380 --> 34:42.380]  to the time you
[34:42.380 --> 34:44.380]  you harvest it
[34:44.380 --> 34:45.380]  it's
[34:45.380 --> 34:46.380]  it's getting moved around
[34:46.380 --> 34:47.380]  in metric
[34:47.380 --> 34:48.380]  yeah it gets
[34:48.380 --> 34:49.380]  into clone
[34:49.380 --> 34:50.380]  once it's harvested
[34:50.380 --> 34:51.380]  it gets weighed out
[34:51.380 --> 34:52.380]  and re-entered into metric
[34:52.380 --> 34:53.380]  and then that's in metric
[34:53.380 --> 34:54.380]  and all the waste
[34:54.380 --> 34:55.380]  gets put into metric
[34:55.380 --> 34:56.380]  all the packages
[34:56.380 --> 34:57.380]  get put into metric
[34:57.380 --> 34:58.380]  so you cut a clone
[34:58.380 --> 34:59.380]  that goes into metric
[34:59.380 --> 35:00.380]  the clone gets a number
[35:00.380 --> 35:02.380]  the plant it comes from
[35:02.380 --> 35:03.380]  has a mother plant number
[35:03.380 --> 35:04.380]  which is also included
[35:04.380 --> 35:05.380]  in that fucking clone number
[35:06.380 --> 35:07.380]  so you got clone number
[35:07.380 --> 35:08.380]  75555
[35:08.380 --> 35:09.380]  that came from plant number
[35:09.380 --> 35:10.380]  75444
[35:11.380 --> 35:12.380]  we can follow all the way
[35:12.380 --> 35:13.380]  down the line
[35:13.380 --> 35:14.380]  where each clone of each clone
[35:14.380 --> 35:15.380]  of each clone came from
[35:16.380 --> 35:17.380]  which is cool
[35:17.380 --> 35:18.380]  because then we can tell you
[35:18.380 --> 35:19.380]  once it's harvested
[35:19.380 --> 35:20.380]  they go into batches
[35:20.380 --> 35:21.380]  and we can tell you
[35:21.380 --> 35:22.380]  what pesticides were applied
[35:22.380 --> 35:24.380]  for fucking seven generations
[35:24.380 --> 35:25.380]  of those plants hypothetically
[35:26.380 --> 35:28.380]  you see why all this is
[35:28.380 --> 35:30.380]  exists during when we have a recall
[35:31.380 --> 35:32.380]  yeah
[35:32.380 --> 35:33.380]  and it's like the 12 stores
[35:33.380 --> 35:34.380]  that bought plants
[35:34.380 --> 35:35.380]  that were harvested
[35:35.380 --> 35:36.380]  between these dates
[35:36.380 --> 35:37.380]  at this facility
[35:37.380 --> 35:38.380]  all have to get
[35:38.380 --> 35:40.380]  and they can track it down
[35:40.380 --> 35:42.380]  to the pre-rolls on the counter
[35:42.380 --> 35:43.380]  yep
[35:43.380 --> 35:45.380]  it's a nice system
[35:45.380 --> 35:46.380]  it's just not at all
[35:46.380 --> 35:47.380]  smoothed out
[35:47.380 --> 35:48.380]  well half the time
[35:48.380 --> 35:49.380]  when you go to use it
[35:49.380 --> 35:50.380]  it just the fucking
[35:50.380 --> 35:51.380]  you get this little wheel of death
[35:51.380 --> 35:52.380]  that just spins in the middle
[35:52.380 --> 35:53.380]  of your fucking screen
[35:53.380 --> 35:54.380]  it looks like the little thing
[35:54.380 --> 35:55.380]  from there used to be
[35:55.380 --> 35:57.380]  a trivial pursuit game
[35:57.380 --> 35:58.380]  and it looks like the fucking
[35:58.380 --> 35:59.380]  trivial pursuit thing
[35:59.380 --> 36:00.380]  just spin or the windows
[36:00.380 --> 36:01.380]  fucking thing
[36:01.380 --> 36:02.380]  just spin or the apple thing
[36:02.380 --> 36:03.380]  that just spins right in the middle
[36:03.380 --> 36:04.380]  of the fucking screen
[36:04.380 --> 36:05.380]  but usually with like windows
[36:05.380 --> 36:06.380]  or apple even windows
[36:06.380 --> 36:07.380]  I'm an apple guy
[36:07.380 --> 36:08.380]  fuck a windows machine
[36:08.380 --> 36:09.380]  in my opinion
[36:09.380 --> 36:10.380]  but it works better
[36:10.380 --> 36:11.380]  than goddamn metric
[36:12.380 --> 36:13.380]  that thing eventually
[36:13.380 --> 36:14.380]  does something metric just goes
[36:14.380 --> 36:15.380]  fuck you fuck you fuck you
[36:15.380 --> 36:16.380]  fuck you fuck you
[36:16.380 --> 36:17.380]  and just spins in circles
[36:17.380 --> 36:18.380]  and it is like middle fingers
[36:18.380 --> 36:19.380]  just coming at you
[36:19.380 --> 36:21.380]  and the shittiest part is
[36:22.380 --> 36:23.380]  this wasn't my end of the building
[36:23.380 --> 36:24.380]  but I witnessed this
[36:24.380 --> 36:25.380]  plenty of times
[36:25.380 --> 36:26.380]  because delivery drivers
[36:26.380 --> 36:28.380]  would come to pick up product
[36:28.380 --> 36:29.380]  from the commercial cultivation
[36:29.380 --> 36:30.380]  you have to pick it up
[36:30.380 --> 36:31.380]  there's dried trim cured
[36:31.380 --> 36:32.380]  ready to go back
[36:32.380 --> 36:33.380]  it has to leave there
[36:33.380 --> 36:34.380]  Mike just doesn't throw
[36:34.380 --> 36:35.380]  in the car and take it
[36:35.380 --> 36:36.380]  a courier comes and gets it
[36:36.380 --> 36:37.380]  and they take that to either
[36:37.380 --> 36:38.380]  a processing facility
[36:38.380 --> 36:39.380]  or to a dispensary
[36:39.380 --> 36:40.380]  for retail sales
[36:40.380 --> 36:42.380]  for that product to leave
[36:42.380 --> 36:44.380]  our commercial cultivation facility
[36:44.380 --> 36:45.380]  it's got to be in metric
[36:45.380 --> 36:46.380]  as a package
[36:46.380 --> 36:47.380]  that package has to be
[36:47.380 --> 36:50.380]  on a manifest for a transport
[36:50.380 --> 36:51.380]  or for a transfer
[36:52.380 --> 36:53.380]  if metric freezes
[36:53.380 --> 36:55.380]  you cannot make the manifest
[36:55.380 --> 36:56.380]  for the transfer
[36:56.380 --> 36:58.380]  and the package has to sit there
[36:58.380 --> 36:59.380]  in our facility
[36:59.380 --> 37:00.380]  and it has to be
[37:00.380 --> 37:01.380]  and the package has to sit there
[37:01.380 --> 37:02.380]  in our facility
[37:02.380 --> 37:04.380]  even if that delivery driver
[37:04.380 --> 37:05.380]  drove from Boulder
[37:05.380 --> 37:06.380]  to pick it up
[37:06.380 --> 37:07.380]  to take it to a
[37:07.380 --> 37:09.380]  concentrate processing facility
[37:09.380 --> 37:11.380]  or an edible facility in Boulder
[37:11.380 --> 37:13.380]  until metric works again
[37:13.380 --> 37:15.380]  everybody just hurry up and wait
[37:15.380 --> 37:17.380]  so we've had delivery drivers
[37:17.380 --> 37:19.380]  just kicking it in the office
[37:19.380 --> 37:21.380]  just hey do you have a phone charger
[37:21.380 --> 37:23.380]  like I've been here for like
[37:23.380 --> 37:24.380]  and I'm not leaving
[37:24.380 --> 37:25.380]  because I mean I can't go anywhere else
[37:25.380 --> 37:26.380]  because none of the other facilities
[37:26.380 --> 37:27.380]  can do anything
[37:27.380 --> 37:29.380]  because metric's frozen everywhere
[37:29.380 --> 37:30.380]  so they just kick it
[37:30.380 --> 37:32.380]  yeah there's a Thai food restaurant
[37:32.380 --> 37:33.380]  right over there
[37:33.380 --> 37:34.380]  it's pretty good
[37:34.380 --> 37:35.380]  there's an Indian food place that way
[37:35.380 --> 37:36.380]  but other than that bro
[37:36.380 --> 37:37.380]  I'm just hanging out
[37:37.380 --> 37:38.380]  have a good time
[37:38.380 --> 37:40.380]  yeah metric will ruin your whole
[37:40.380 --> 37:41.380]  fucking day
[37:42.380 --> 37:44.380]  yeah so a lot of times
[37:44.380 --> 37:45.380]  I'm lucky because
[37:45.380 --> 37:46.380]  when I cut the clones
[37:46.380 --> 37:47.380]  that I talk about
[37:47.380 --> 37:48.380]  have to be put into metric
[37:48.380 --> 37:49.380]  I do it on a clipboard
[37:49.380 --> 37:50.380]  because I got dirty ass hands
[37:50.380 --> 37:51.380]  I'm dirty I'm in a hurry
[37:51.380 --> 37:53.380]  and I don't want to go to the computer
[37:53.380 --> 37:54.380]  and fucking take off my gloves
[37:54.380 --> 37:55.380]  and type in six clones
[37:55.380 --> 37:56.380]  of fucking chem dog
[37:56.380 --> 37:57.380]  and go back and put on gloves
[37:57.380 --> 37:58.380]  and cut more
[37:58.380 --> 37:59.380]  and then wipe off again
[37:59.380 --> 38:01.380]  so I keep a fucking marker
[38:01.380 --> 38:02.380]  and a big piece of paper
[38:02.380 --> 38:03.380]  and I scribble it
[38:03.380 --> 38:04.380]  and Mike has to fucking put it
[38:04.380 --> 38:05.380]  in the computer for me
[38:05.380 --> 38:07.380]  so I'm pretty spoiled on that part
[38:07.380 --> 38:08.380]  to tell you the god damn truth
[38:08.380 --> 38:09.380]  not a lot of growth facilities have that
[38:09.380 --> 38:10.380]  you're welcome buddy
[38:10.380 --> 38:11.380]  yeah thank you bro
[38:11.380 --> 38:12.380]  I appreciate it
[38:12.380 --> 38:13.380]  that's why I always
[38:13.380 --> 38:14.380]  any group I work at
[38:14.380 --> 38:15.380]  I get Mike a spot
[38:15.380 --> 38:16.380]  I'm like Mike's my metric guy
[38:16.380 --> 38:17.380]  let's just get Mike in here
[38:17.380 --> 38:18.380]  we work together
[38:18.380 --> 38:19.380]  and I point and grunt
[38:19.380 --> 38:20.380]  you know what needs to happen
[38:20.380 --> 38:21.380]  yup
[38:21.380 --> 38:22.380]  it's beautiful
[38:22.380 --> 38:23.380]  we just got some really cool
[38:23.380 --> 38:24.380]  lightning outside
[38:24.380 --> 38:25.380]  I hope we don't lose
[38:25.380 --> 38:26.380]  internet connection
[38:26.380 --> 38:27.380]  but it's really beautiful lightning
[38:27.380 --> 38:28.380]  bring on the rain
[38:28.380 --> 38:30.380]  yeah bring it bring it bring it
[38:30.380 --> 38:33.380]  yeah metric can be
[38:33.380 --> 38:34.380]  a fucking headache
[38:34.380 --> 38:35.380]  shout out to anybody out there
[38:35.380 --> 38:36.380]  that has to mess with metric
[38:36.380 --> 38:37.380]  metric is in several states
[38:37.380 --> 38:39.380]  if you're a metric warrior
[38:39.380 --> 38:41.380]  I feel for you
[38:41.380 --> 38:42.380]  that's the only kind of keyboard warrior
[38:42.380 --> 38:43.380]  I got love for
[38:43.380 --> 38:45.380]  is a metric keyboard warrior
[38:47.380 --> 38:49.380]  it can be fucking brutal
[38:49.380 --> 38:50.380]  that's for damn sure
[38:50.380 --> 38:52.380]  and I always hated
[38:52.380 --> 38:54.380]  when a delivery driver was early
[38:54.380 --> 38:56.380]  and it was like alright
[38:56.380 --> 38:58.380]  dude now I gotta roll the dice
[38:58.380 --> 39:00.380]  like is it gonna fuck with me today
[39:00.380 --> 39:01.380]  or is it gonna play nice
[39:01.380 --> 39:03.380]  cause it was gonna play nice
[39:03.380 --> 39:04.380]  if you showed up on time
[39:04.380 --> 39:06.380]  and then people are gonna say
[39:06.380 --> 39:07.380]  well why don't you make the manifest
[39:07.380 --> 39:08.380]  at the start of the day
[39:08.380 --> 39:09.380]  or the night before
[39:09.380 --> 39:10.380]  there's a time limit
[39:10.380 --> 39:11.380]  you can only make a manifest
[39:11.380 --> 39:12.380]  within a certain time frame
[39:12.380 --> 39:14.380]  before the delivery leaves
[39:14.380 --> 39:16.380]  also we need the delivery driver's
[39:16.380 --> 39:18.380]  identification while he's on site
[39:18.380 --> 39:20.380]  we need the vehicle license plate number
[39:20.380 --> 39:23.380]  we need the driver's identification
[39:23.380 --> 39:24.380]  his driver's license
[39:24.380 --> 39:25.380]  and his medical or his
[39:25.380 --> 39:27.380]  Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[39:27.380 --> 39:28.380]  Division badge number
[39:28.380 --> 39:30.380]  so we don't know if Kyle
[39:30.380 --> 39:31.380]  the delivery driver is coming
[39:31.380 --> 39:32.380]  in the Subaru
[39:32.380 --> 39:34.380]  we don't know if Tom is coming
[39:34.380 --> 39:36.380]  in the fucking Mitsubishi
[39:36.380 --> 39:38.380]  we don't know if fucking Kyle
[39:38.380 --> 39:39.380]  is driving a different car this time
[39:39.380 --> 39:41.380]  so unless you can contact them
[39:41.380 --> 39:43.380]  and then by lunchtime
[39:43.380 --> 39:45.380]  traffic from fucking Boulder to Pueblo
[39:45.380 --> 39:46.380]  that's three hours
[39:46.380 --> 39:47.380]  Kyle may bail out
[39:47.380 --> 39:49.380]  and fucking Tom may end up
[39:49.380 --> 39:50.380]  being our fucking delivery driver today
[39:50.380 --> 39:52.380]  so then we gotta tear up
[39:52.380 --> 39:53.380]  the whole fucking manifest
[39:53.380 --> 39:54.380]  cancel the delivery
[39:54.380 --> 39:56.380]  and redo the whole fucking thing
[39:56.380 --> 39:58.380]  so that's why we don't do
[39:58.380 --> 39:59.380]  the manifest in the morning
[39:59.380 --> 40:00.380]  we've tried
[40:00.380 --> 40:03.380]  you only redo three or four manifests
[40:03.380 --> 40:04.380]  before you stop trying to
[40:04.380 --> 40:06.380]  prep them too early
[40:06.380 --> 40:07.380]  yeah
[40:07.380 --> 40:08.380]  it's brutal
[40:08.380 --> 40:10.380]  you have you redo too many of them
[40:10.380 --> 40:11.380]  and then all of a sudden
[40:11.380 --> 40:12.380]  somebody's got questions about
[40:12.380 --> 40:13.380]  why you're redoing them
[40:13.380 --> 40:16.380]  and it's just the whole system
[40:16.380 --> 40:17.380]  I've tried to explain to people
[40:17.380 --> 40:18.380]  that are like man
[40:18.380 --> 40:19.380]  legalization is gonna be awesome
[40:19.380 --> 40:21.380]  I'm gonna grow weed in my basement
[40:21.380 --> 40:22.380]  and sell it to stores
[40:23.380 --> 40:25.380]  that part of legalization disappears quick
[40:25.380 --> 40:27.380]  yeah that's for like six months
[40:27.380 --> 40:28.380]  in a new market
[40:28.380 --> 40:30.380]  you get that wild wild west vibe
[40:30.380 --> 40:31.380]  unless you're Michigan
[40:31.380 --> 40:33.380]  it feels like they hung on to that
[40:33.380 --> 40:34.380]  hung on to that shit for a while
[40:34.380 --> 40:37.380]  but Oklahoma tightened up quite quickly
[40:37.380 --> 40:39.380]  California definitely tried
[40:39.380 --> 40:41.380]  is trying I don't know
[40:41.380 --> 40:42.380]  it is trying
[40:42.380 --> 40:44.380]  Cali's a unique situation
[40:44.380 --> 40:47.380]  they dragged their feet for like 18 years
[40:47.380 --> 40:49.380]  which is why they're having so much trouble
[40:50.380 --> 40:52.380]  the newer emerging legalization markets
[40:52.380 --> 40:55.380]  they seem to launch with
[40:55.380 --> 40:58.380]  much more rules and regs in place
[40:58.380 --> 41:01.380]  originally than some of the early launches did
[41:01.380 --> 41:03.380]  like when Colorado and Cali
[41:03.380 --> 41:05.380]  and Washington first went
[41:05.380 --> 41:07.380]  it was just like weed's legal now
[41:07.380 --> 41:08.380]  dot dot dot
[41:08.380 --> 41:09.380]  like here
[41:09.380 --> 41:10.380]  like so
[41:10.380 --> 41:11.380]  tell me the rules
[41:11.380 --> 41:12.380]  when you figure out the taxes
[41:12.380 --> 41:14.380]  it goes to schools
[41:14.380 --> 41:16.380]  that's the whole rule
[41:16.380 --> 41:17.380]  you can carry two ounces
[41:17.380 --> 41:19.380]  and you can have 99 plants
[41:19.380 --> 41:21.380]  that's pretty much the rules that we know of
[41:21.380 --> 41:22.380]  okay cool
[41:22.380 --> 41:23.380]  let's have a good ass time
[41:23.380 --> 41:25.380]  the 99 plant rule wasn't even really a rule
[41:25.380 --> 41:30.380]  it was a pre-existing federal amplifier
[41:30.380 --> 41:32.380]  where the feds had a rule in place
[41:32.380 --> 41:34.380]  and it wasn't even a written down rule
[41:34.380 --> 41:36.380]  it was just a rule of thumb
[41:36.380 --> 41:38.380]  if they catch a guy with 99 plants
[41:38.380 --> 41:40.380]  the federal government doesn't care
[41:40.380 --> 41:42.380]  if the federal government finds you with 100 plants
[41:42.380 --> 41:44.380]  they consider you Al Capone
[41:45.380 --> 41:48.380]  so that became just the de facto
[41:48.380 --> 41:49.380]  in Colorado
[41:49.380 --> 41:51.380]  and then people for a while
[41:51.380 --> 41:53.380]  were going with 499
[41:53.380 --> 41:55.380]  because that was another federal cutoff
[41:55.380 --> 41:58.380]  where you got one penalty for 499
[41:58.380 --> 42:00.380]  and another penalty for 500
[42:00.380 --> 42:01.380]  man
[42:01.380 --> 42:02.380]  so, yup
[42:02.380 --> 42:04.380]  yeah those were the days bro
[42:04.380 --> 42:06.380]  wow the last days were fun
[42:06.380 --> 42:08.380]  people just open a dispensary
[42:08.380 --> 42:09.380]  just up there
[42:09.380 --> 42:10.380]  oh we rented some space
[42:10.380 --> 42:11.380]  and we put up a sign
[42:11.380 --> 42:12.380]  and it says weed
[42:12.380 --> 42:13.380]  and you're just coming to buy an eighth
[42:13.380 --> 42:14.380]  if you got a card
[42:14.380 --> 42:16.380]  and we got four different strains
[42:16.380 --> 42:17.380]  and four different jars
[42:17.380 --> 42:18.380]  and
[42:19.380 --> 42:21.380]  we've got to juggle over the nightstick
[42:21.380 --> 42:22.380]  at the door
[42:22.380 --> 42:24.380]  we're calling it good
[42:24.380 --> 42:25.380]  the owner's wife made some edibles
[42:25.380 --> 42:28.380]  that'll probably fucking halfway kill you
[42:28.380 --> 42:29.380]  but I mean they're only six bucks
[42:29.380 --> 42:31.380]  so yeah those were the days dude
[42:31.380 --> 42:32.380]  shout out to Karen
[42:32.380 --> 42:33.380]  rest in peace
[42:33.380 --> 42:34.380]  love you Karen
[42:34.380 --> 42:35.380]  your edibles fucking ruined my life
[42:35.380 --> 42:36.380]  in the best of ways
[42:36.380 --> 42:38.380]  I fell down the stairs at that dispensary bro
[42:38.380 --> 42:41.380]  we ate too many of those fudge sticks one day
[42:41.380 --> 42:43.380]  and I fell down those fucking stairs
[42:43.380 --> 42:45.380]  so stoned and comfortable
[42:45.380 --> 42:47.380]  that I just like rolled down
[42:47.380 --> 42:49.380]  and just stood up and walked out of it
[42:49.380 --> 42:51.380]  like it was just like how it was meant to be
[42:51.380 --> 42:52.380]  like I didn't fall
[42:52.380 --> 42:54.380]  I just didn't use my feet to get down
[42:54.380 --> 42:57.380]  it was awkwardly beautiful
[42:57.380 --> 42:59.380]  it uh
[42:59.380 --> 43:01.380]  there's so many
[43:02.380 --> 43:04.380]  you had to be there to believe it
[43:04.380 --> 43:06.380]  type stories at that place
[43:06.380 --> 43:09.380]  just every day there was another one
[43:09.380 --> 43:10.380]  well I was
[43:10.380 --> 43:11.380]  I can tell you a thousand good ones
[43:11.380 --> 43:13.380]  I was the fucking the bud tender
[43:13.380 --> 43:15.380]  you'd step into the bud room
[43:15.380 --> 43:17.380]  so you walk in and meet a lovely lady named Tree
[43:17.380 --> 43:18.380]  you should check your ID
[43:18.380 --> 43:19.380]  check your paperwork
[43:19.380 --> 43:20.380]  make sure you're legit
[43:20.380 --> 43:21.380]  my buddy would stare you down
[43:21.380 --> 43:22.380]  yeah what's up Tree
[43:22.380 --> 43:23.380]  hope you're well
[43:23.380 --> 43:24.380]  she'll never hear this
[43:24.380 --> 43:25.380]  but I hope she's good either way
[43:25.380 --> 43:27.380]  and Mr. Tamler hope you're well as well
[43:27.380 --> 43:29.380]  so fucking
[43:29.380 --> 43:31.380]  the security guard would stare you down
[43:31.380 --> 43:33.380]  and make sure you're not fucking gonna do anything crazy
[43:33.380 --> 43:35.380]  but he looked more fucking threatening than anybody else
[43:35.380 --> 43:36.380]  so
[43:36.380 --> 43:38.380]  then people would come back into the bud room
[43:38.380 --> 43:39.380]  and I'd have a few jars
[43:39.380 --> 43:41.380]  and we'd have some offerings and some edibles
[43:41.380 --> 43:42.380]  and if you couldn't decide
[43:42.380 --> 43:45.380]  if you wanted the white rhino or the northern lights
[43:45.380 --> 43:46.380]  fuck it I got a pipe
[43:46.380 --> 43:47.380]  I'll fucking pack you up a bowl
[43:47.380 --> 43:48.380]  which one do you want to try
[43:48.380 --> 43:49.380]  let you try them both
[43:49.380 --> 43:50.380]  you know which one you want first
[43:50.380 --> 43:51.380]  hit that white rhino
[43:51.380 --> 43:52.380]  get a good taste
[43:52.380 --> 43:54.380]  and then hit that northern lights or whatever
[43:54.380 --> 43:56.380]  the white widow whatever else I fucking said
[43:56.380 --> 43:57.380]  and then
[43:57.380 --> 43:58.380]  I really think I like that one
[43:58.380 --> 43:59.380]  can I get an eighth
[43:59.380 --> 44:00.380]  sure man here's an eighth
[44:00.380 --> 44:01.380]  and since uh
[44:01.380 --> 44:02.380]  you're gonna come back
[44:02.380 --> 44:03.380]  I know you come back here a lot
[44:03.380 --> 44:04.380]  here's a fucking gram of some other random shit
[44:04.380 --> 44:05.380]  just because you buy a lot of shit here
[44:05.380 --> 44:06.380]  and I want you to
[44:06.380 --> 44:07.380]  yeah that way you know
[44:07.380 --> 44:08.380]  you tried three while you're here
[44:08.380 --> 44:09.380]  here's another one
[44:09.380 --> 44:10.380]  try that while you're home
[44:10.380 --> 44:11.380]  see if you like that
[44:11.380 --> 44:12.380]  and you got a lot of options
[44:12.380 --> 44:13.380]  and we got a lot of people set up on medical marijuana
[44:13.380 --> 44:14.380]  you'd be able to come back
[44:14.380 --> 44:15.380]  and just smoke a bowl back there
[44:16.380 --> 44:18.380]  uh the lady that owned the place
[44:18.380 --> 44:19.380]  or the owner's wife
[44:19.380 --> 44:20.380]  she loved to bake
[44:20.380 --> 44:21.380]  and they grew
[44:21.380 --> 44:24.380]  and her favorite thing was to make edibles
[44:24.380 --> 44:26.380]  her second favorite thing
[44:26.380 --> 44:28.380]  so such good homemade
[44:28.380 --> 44:29.380]  there was delicious too
[44:29.380 --> 44:30.380]  amazing
[44:30.380 --> 44:31.380]  processed
[44:31.380 --> 44:33.380]  like grandma made banana bread
[44:33.380 --> 44:34.380]  kind of fucking edibles
[44:34.380 --> 44:36.380]  like not like store-bought
[44:36.380 --> 44:37.380]  like weird
[44:37.380 --> 44:39.380]  but like the fudge dude
[44:39.380 --> 44:40.380]  oh the fudge
[44:40.380 --> 44:42.380]  I am like 99% vegan
[44:42.380 --> 44:43.380]  nobody cares
[44:43.380 --> 44:45.380]  I'm just I am like mostly vegan
[44:45.380 --> 44:46.380]  but if some of that fudge showed up
[44:46.380 --> 44:47.380]  I'd have to take a bite
[44:47.380 --> 44:49.380]  like that stuff was so freaking good
[44:49.380 --> 44:51.380]  and it's like mostly dairy
[44:51.380 --> 44:52.380]  but this lady
[44:52.380 --> 44:55.380]  I said her favorite thing was to make amazing edibles
[44:55.380 --> 44:56.380]  her second thing
[44:56.380 --> 44:58.380]  was to bring them to the dispensary
[44:58.380 --> 45:00.380]  and tell Mike and I
[45:00.380 --> 45:01.380]  you gotta try them
[45:01.380 --> 45:02.380]  because we can't put them on the shelf
[45:02.380 --> 45:04.380]  without trying them
[45:04.380 --> 45:06.380]  and this was before lab testing
[45:06.380 --> 45:08.380]  lab testing used to be like this
[45:08.380 --> 45:09.380]  tastes good
[45:09.380 --> 45:10.380]  three people ate it
[45:10.380 --> 45:13.380]  and then an hour later had a conversation about it
[45:13.380 --> 45:15.380]  if one of us was asleep on the couch
[45:15.380 --> 45:17.380]  we'd probably sell that product
[45:17.380 --> 45:19.380]  the first time I was working there
[45:19.380 --> 45:21.380]  and she brought in the edibles
[45:21.380 --> 45:24.380]  she's like here's your one of everything
[45:24.380 --> 45:26.380]  and I was like that's amazing
[45:26.380 --> 45:27.380]  oh my god thank you
[45:27.380 --> 45:29.380]  and five minutes later she was like
[45:29.380 --> 45:30.380]  which one have you tried
[45:30.380 --> 45:31.380]  and I was like
[45:31.380 --> 45:33.380]  it's 10.05 in the morning
[45:34.380 --> 45:35.380]  on a Tuesday
[45:35.380 --> 45:37.380]  and I'm at my new job
[45:37.380 --> 45:38.380]  so none
[45:39.380 --> 45:41.380]  she's like well you gotta try one
[45:41.380 --> 45:42.380]  an hour later
[45:42.380 --> 45:44.380]  it's like oh fuck I have to work now
[45:44.380 --> 45:45.380]  yep
[45:45.380 --> 45:46.380]  we all knew
[45:46.380 --> 45:47.380]  it was like
[45:47.380 --> 45:49.380]  but it seemed like
[45:49.380 --> 45:52.380]  fate always juggled the fucking puddle on the floor ball
[45:52.380 --> 45:54.380]  it was never me and you on the floor
[45:54.380 --> 45:55.380]  it was one of us
[45:55.380 --> 45:57.380]  like quite often one of us had to go sit in the car
[45:57.380 --> 45:59.380]  and fucking get an extra lunch break
[45:59.380 --> 46:01.380]  I'd find you out in the back patio
[46:01.380 --> 46:04.380]  yeah I'd find you on that back patio upstairs
[46:04.380 --> 46:06.380]  smoking a cigarette with this look on your face
[46:06.380 --> 46:08.380]  like oh he just got too high on his break
[46:08.380 --> 46:09.380]  he'll be back in a few minutes
[46:09.380 --> 46:11.380]  like you just gotta leave Mike alone
[46:11.380 --> 46:13.380]  but there was always enough of us in there
[46:13.380 --> 46:14.380]  we could just juggle it
[46:14.380 --> 46:15.380]  like we never
[46:15.380 --> 46:17.380]  I managed a 40 lane bowling center
[46:17.380 --> 46:18.380]  it always seemed to be the same way
[46:18.380 --> 46:19.380]  one of us would be like
[46:19.380 --> 46:21.380]  you gotta hide from the boss
[46:21.380 --> 46:23.380]  and like the rest of us would just make the shit work
[46:23.380 --> 46:24.380]  and his job would get done
[46:24.380 --> 46:26.380]  or her job would get done
[46:26.380 --> 46:27.380]  it always seemed to work that way
[46:27.380 --> 46:29.380]  at the dispensary for us as well
[46:29.380 --> 46:30.380]  but those edibles bro
[46:30.380 --> 46:32.380]  I miss that lady and I miss her edibles
[46:32.380 --> 46:34.380]  yeah the fudge was especially nice
[46:34.380 --> 46:35.380]  the fudge and the banana bread
[46:35.380 --> 46:36.380]  I remember specifically
[46:36.380 --> 46:38.380]  those were chocolate covered cherries
[46:38.380 --> 46:39.380]  like it was just insane
[46:39.380 --> 46:40.380]  yeah cookies
[46:40.380 --> 46:43.380]  any kind of macadamia nut
[46:43.380 --> 46:44.380]  chocolate chip oatmeal
[46:44.380 --> 46:46.380]  raisin fucking sugar cookies
[46:46.380 --> 46:47.380]  holiday time
[46:47.380 --> 46:48.380]  whatever holiday snack was available
[46:48.380 --> 46:50.380]  she made that medicated
[46:50.380 --> 46:51.380]  and they were
[46:51.380 --> 46:54.380]  this was before all of the crazy regulations
[46:54.380 --> 46:55.380]  so they were growing
[46:55.380 --> 46:57.380]  none of this exists anymore
[46:57.380 --> 46:59.380]  she's not even here anymore
[46:59.380 --> 47:00.380]  so she can't get in any trouble
[47:00.380 --> 47:02.380]  they were growing in multiple multiple locations
[47:02.380 --> 47:03.380]  like their house
[47:03.380 --> 47:05.380]  their bedrooms had plants in every bedroom
[47:05.380 --> 47:07.380]  you had to move plants over to take a piss
[47:07.380 --> 47:09.380]  like get them out of the way so you can use the bathroom
[47:09.380 --> 47:10.380]  they had a lot of material to make edibles
[47:10.380 --> 47:13.380]  they were not fucking amateur edibles
[47:13.380 --> 47:14.380]  she was like
[47:14.380 --> 47:17.380]  how much weed can butter possibly hold
[47:17.380 --> 47:18.380]  like
[47:18.380 --> 47:19.380]  yep
[47:19.380 --> 47:20.380]  it was
[47:20.380 --> 47:23.380]  yeah it wasn't can of butter at that point
[47:23.380 --> 47:25.380]  it was like buttered cannabis
[47:25.380 --> 47:26.380]  yeah
[47:26.380 --> 47:27.380]  it was so good
[47:27.380 --> 47:28.380]  yeah
[47:28.380 --> 47:29.380]  we would get so red
[47:29.380 --> 47:31.380]  but you're totally right dude
[47:31.380 --> 47:32.380]  it would be 10 in the morning
[47:32.380 --> 47:33.380]  and she'd be offering you fucking
[47:33.380 --> 47:34.380]  banana bread
[47:34.380 --> 47:35.380]  carrot cake
[47:35.380 --> 47:36.380]  fudge
[47:36.380 --> 47:37.380]  and a sugar cookie
[47:37.380 --> 47:38.380]  and you're like
[47:38.380 --> 47:39.380]  I'm gonna get diabetes
[47:39.380 --> 47:41.380]  and be too high to work by lunchtime
[47:41.380 --> 47:43.380]  but you tell her
[47:43.380 --> 47:44.380]  alright I had
[47:44.380 --> 47:45.380]  I had a piece of the banana bread
[47:45.380 --> 47:46.380]  it was wonderful
[47:46.380 --> 47:47.380]  I really liked it
[47:47.380 --> 47:48.380]  good job
[47:48.380 --> 47:49.380]  thumbs up
[47:49.380 --> 47:50.380]  she'd be like cool
[47:50.380 --> 47:51.380]  which one are you gonna eat next
[47:51.380 --> 47:52.380]  and five minutes later
[47:52.380 --> 47:53.380]  she'd be like
[47:53.380 --> 47:54.380]  how did it taste
[47:54.380 --> 47:55.380]  she was a happy lady bro
[47:55.380 --> 47:56.380]  I love that woman
[47:56.380 --> 47:57.380]  she was so nice
[47:57.380 --> 47:58.380]  yeah
[47:58.380 --> 47:59.380]  shout out to those guys
[47:59.380 --> 48:00.380]  I don't want to say both of their names
[48:00.380 --> 48:01.380]  because I said too much already
[48:01.380 --> 48:02.380]  but without them
[48:02.380 --> 48:04.380]  we wouldn't be where we are Mike
[48:04.380 --> 48:06.380]  so I always like to remember that
[48:06.380 --> 48:08.380]  and pay some homage and tribute to those folks
[48:08.380 --> 48:09.380]  that was the catalyst
[48:09.380 --> 48:10.380]  yeah
[48:10.380 --> 48:12.380]  his court trial
[48:12.380 --> 48:14.380]  introduced me to being comfortable
[48:14.380 --> 48:15.380]  in a courtroom
[48:15.380 --> 48:16.380]  and understanding that process
[48:16.380 --> 48:18.380]  and I think he relied on you
[48:18.380 --> 48:20.380]  for a lot of that sort of stuff as well
[48:20.380 --> 48:21.380]  and when
[48:21.380 --> 48:24.380]  when the city ended that
[48:24.380 --> 48:25.380]  like they did
[48:25.380 --> 48:26.380]  that anger
[48:26.380 --> 48:31.380]  it fueled me to do years of city council shit
[48:31.380 --> 48:32.380]  just years
[48:32.380 --> 48:36.380]  of that one injustice
[48:36.380 --> 48:38.380]  so what Mike is talking about is
[48:38.380 --> 48:39.380]  we had the privilege
[48:39.380 --> 48:41.380]  I've talked about this before on the podcast
[48:41.380 --> 48:43.380]  we had the privilege of being a large part
[48:43.380 --> 48:45.380]  of the very first dispensary
[48:45.380 --> 48:47.380]  within the city of Pueblo, Colorado
[48:47.380 --> 48:51.380]  I found some people who were trying to open a dispensary
[48:51.380 --> 48:52.380]  no offense to them
[48:52.380 --> 48:53.380]  they were older
[48:53.380 --> 48:54.380]  they're of another generation
[48:54.380 --> 48:56.380]  they didn't have the hip edge
[48:56.380 --> 48:57.380]  that a dispensary needed
[48:57.380 --> 48:59.380]  and they didn't have any balls
[48:59.380 --> 49:00.380]  they had little balls
[49:00.380 --> 49:01.380]  they were trying to get it started
[49:01.380 --> 49:04.380]  they tried to do it on a third floor office space
[49:04.380 --> 49:07.380]  I moved the dispensary to the fucking ground floor
[49:07.380 --> 49:08.380]  and put a sign out front
[49:08.380 --> 49:10.380]  and fucking we turned that little idea
[49:10.380 --> 49:13.380]  into a fucking flourishing business
[49:13.380 --> 49:14.380]  it was crushing
[49:14.380 --> 49:15.380]  and then one day
[49:15.380 --> 49:17.380]  some city officials came in
[49:17.380 --> 49:18.380]  and they're like no mas
[49:18.380 --> 49:19.380]  and they shut us down
[49:19.380 --> 49:21.380]  they gave us a letter
[49:21.380 --> 49:23.380]  that it literally said
[49:23.380 --> 49:25.380]  we're closing your business
[49:25.380 --> 49:27.380]  because you're breaking the rules
[49:27.380 --> 49:31.380]  we're discussing passing into law
[49:31.380 --> 49:33.380]  so you have to close
[49:33.380 --> 49:35.380]  and that's just
[49:35.380 --> 49:37.380]  how can you shut a business down
[49:37.380 --> 49:39.380]  for passing rules that don't exist yet
[49:39.380 --> 49:40.380]  that's insanely fucked
[49:40.380 --> 49:42.380]  and they did not know we were breaking rules
[49:42.380 --> 49:44.380]  that did not exist yet
[49:44.380 --> 49:48.380]  until we paid them $21,000 in a tax payment
[49:48.380 --> 49:50.380]  that was our retail sales tax that we paid them
[49:50.380 --> 49:51.380]  and then they asked
[49:51.380 --> 49:52.380]  how'd you make so much money
[49:52.380 --> 49:53.380]  and they took their time
[49:53.380 --> 49:54.380]  and they came to figure out
[49:54.380 --> 49:55.380]  what kind of business we had
[49:55.380 --> 49:57.380]  after we'd been on the news
[49:57.380 --> 49:58.380]  talking about our business
[49:58.380 --> 50:00.380]  after we'd made a solid business plan
[50:00.380 --> 50:01.380]  with the letter of intent
[50:01.380 --> 50:03.380]  all of that was filed appropriately
[50:03.380 --> 50:04.380]  but then one day
[50:04.380 --> 50:06.380]  they're like they made $21,000 in taxes
[50:06.380 --> 50:08.380]  let's go close that shit down
[50:08.380 --> 50:10.380]  this was back when
[50:10.380 --> 50:12.380]  there were what
[50:12.380 --> 50:15.380]  four, five, six dispensaries in the state?
[50:15.380 --> 50:16.380]  yeah
[50:16.380 --> 50:17.380]  there may have been more than that
[50:17.380 --> 50:18.380]  because
[50:18.380 --> 50:21.380]  when I got to take weekends off
[50:21.380 --> 50:23.380]  I worked there for six days a week
[50:23.380 --> 50:24.380]  for like six months
[50:24.380 --> 50:25.380]  but when I finally got
[50:25.380 --> 50:26.380]  when they first opened
[50:26.380 --> 50:28.380]  right after they opened
[50:28.380 --> 50:29.380]  there was a little bit of a
[50:29.380 --> 50:31.380]  explosion across the state
[50:31.380 --> 50:33.380]  the broad strip damn boom in Denver
[50:33.380 --> 50:34.380]  but I think they were one of the first 10
[50:34.380 --> 50:36.380]  yeah I would agree with that
[50:36.380 --> 50:38.380]  but then one of my jobs
[50:38.380 --> 50:40.380]  the owner would give me a budget
[50:40.380 --> 50:43.380]  to go cruise to other dispensaries
[50:43.380 --> 50:46.380]  in Colorado Springs, Denver, Boulder, Fort Collins
[50:46.380 --> 50:47.380]  wherever I could go
[50:47.380 --> 50:49.380]  if I was going somewhere that weekend
[50:49.380 --> 50:50.380]  he'd be like well make sure to hit
[50:50.380 --> 50:52.380]  whatever here's your budget
[50:52.380 --> 50:53.380]  and he'd fucking throw me money dude
[50:53.380 --> 50:54.380]  he'd be like make sure
[50:54.380 --> 50:56.380]  and we'd come back and we'd all
[50:56.380 --> 50:57.380]  there would be
[50:57.380 --> 50:59.380]  back then we could smoke in the dispensary and shit
[50:59.380 --> 51:00.380]  we had a little employee area
[51:00.380 --> 51:02.380]  and we'd all just gather around on Monday morning
[51:02.380 --> 51:04.380]  and see what Jeff brought from Denver
[51:04.380 --> 51:05.380]  fucking this is what I got at Kind Love
[51:05.380 --> 51:07.380]  this is what I got at the Ganja Gourmet
[51:07.380 --> 51:08.380]  this is what came from the clinic
[51:08.380 --> 51:09.380]  this is what came from Cam
[51:09.380 --> 51:11.380]  and we'd all just set it all on the table
[51:11.380 --> 51:12.380]  and just puff
[51:12.380 --> 51:13.380]  because the owner of that store bought it
[51:13.380 --> 51:14.380]  it wasn't really mine
[51:14.380 --> 51:16.380]  but he gave me the money to go see
[51:16.380 --> 51:18.380]  what's available at all these other places
[51:18.380 --> 51:19.380]  that was really fun
[51:19.380 --> 51:20.380]  and they would just let me just
[51:20.380 --> 51:21.380]  fucking here's 300 bucks
[51:21.380 --> 51:23.380]  get us like a few eighths of good shit
[51:23.380 --> 51:24.380]  like okay
[51:24.380 --> 51:25.380]  it's always a good time
[51:26.380 --> 51:28.380]  I would walk out of stores back then
[51:28.380 --> 51:30.380]  I would go into stores
[51:30.380 --> 51:32.380]  and I'd be like man I really don't want anything here
[51:32.380 --> 51:33.380]  we did that a lot
[51:33.380 --> 51:35.380]  we did that a lot
[51:35.380 --> 51:39.380]  and I remember when regs first started going down
[51:39.380 --> 51:40.380]  we did it again
[51:40.380 --> 51:45.380]  to see how each outfit was implementing
[51:45.380 --> 51:47.380]  new rules that had come down the pipe
[51:47.380 --> 51:49.380]  and it was always curious
[51:49.380 --> 51:51.380]  when you'd run into a shop that was like
[51:51.380 --> 51:53.380]  we decided fuck the new memo
[51:53.380 --> 51:55.380]  we're not going to do any of that shit
[51:55.380 --> 51:56.380]  and you'd see two weeks later
[51:56.380 --> 51:57.380]  they're gone and you're like
[51:57.380 --> 51:59.380]  what happened to them
[51:59.380 --> 52:01.380]  and there are still a couple of shops
[52:01.380 --> 52:02.380]  there's one around here
[52:02.380 --> 52:03.380]  that you mentioned to me
[52:03.380 --> 52:04.380]  I'm not going to say their name on the show
[52:04.380 --> 52:05.380]  sorry guys
[52:05.380 --> 52:06.380]  I know a lot of times you ask me to do that
[52:06.380 --> 52:07.380]  but I don't want to
[52:07.380 --> 52:08.380]  I don't need to call businesses out
[52:08.380 --> 52:09.380]  and start rivalries
[52:09.380 --> 52:10.380]  we're older than that now
[52:10.380 --> 52:11.380]  we're past that
[52:11.380 --> 52:12.380]  but there's one shop around here
[52:12.380 --> 52:13.380]  I go there occasionally
[52:13.380 --> 52:15.380]  to get green dot concentrates
[52:15.380 --> 52:16.380]  because when the other spots out
[52:16.380 --> 52:18.380]  or I bought all the flavors there
[52:18.380 --> 52:20.380]  or maybe I've gotten my fucking limit for the day
[52:20.380 --> 52:21.380]  and I got to head to another shop or whatever
[52:21.380 --> 52:23.380]  I'll go to this place and get some green dot
[52:23.380 --> 52:24.380]  it's affordable
[52:24.380 --> 52:25.380]  it's effective
[52:25.380 --> 52:26.380]  they're nice
[52:26.380 --> 52:27.380]  but I look around and I'm like
[52:27.380 --> 52:28.380]  violation number one
[52:28.380 --> 52:29.380]  a violation number two
[52:29.380 --> 52:32.380]  that's like at least a $10,000 fucking ticket right there
[52:32.380 --> 52:34.380]  oh you just brought out
[52:34.380 --> 52:35.380]  instead of bringing out the jar
[52:35.380 --> 52:38.380]  they bring out the fucking 10 pound bag of flour
[52:38.380 --> 52:39.380]  and just weigh it with their hand
[52:39.380 --> 52:41.380]  and scoop out your ounce like this
[52:41.380 --> 52:42.380]  into a baggie on the scale
[52:42.380 --> 52:43.380]  and I was like
[52:44.380 --> 52:46.380]  I see just seven violations
[52:46.380 --> 52:48.380]  like just in that transaction
[52:48.380 --> 52:50.380]  and they're still there though
[52:50.380 --> 52:51.380]  they thrive
[52:51.380 --> 52:53.380]  there's always a line outside that fucking place
[52:53.380 --> 52:55.380]  some of that shit blows my mind
[52:55.380 --> 52:58.380]  because I've been involved in both sides of the coin
[52:58.380 --> 53:00.380]  I've had metric come down on us
[53:00.380 --> 53:01.380]  and the MED come down
[53:01.380 --> 53:02.380]  like this little thing that you did
[53:02.380 --> 53:04.380]  nah nah nah nah nah
[53:04.380 --> 53:05.380]  and I've also called them
[53:05.380 --> 53:07.380]  and been like yeah I've got a major fucking problem
[53:07.380 --> 53:08.380]  and they're like hey thank you for calling
[53:08.380 --> 53:10.380]  we'll solve this not a big deal
[53:10.380 --> 53:11.380]  so it's hard to guess what
[53:11.380 --> 53:14.380]  yeah I've been on both sides of that fucking coin with metric
[53:14.380 --> 53:16.380]  yeah it's such a weird
[53:16.380 --> 53:18.380]  but I catch it too when I
[53:18.380 --> 53:20.380]  when I walk into their obvious stuff
[53:20.380 --> 53:22.380]  and it's like how are you getting away with this
[53:22.380 --> 53:24.380]  or uh
[53:24.380 --> 53:26.380]  just one of my favorites is
[53:26.380 --> 53:29.380]  there's a rule that you can't have a window
[53:29.380 --> 53:32.380]  where product is visible from the street
[53:32.380 --> 53:34.380]  and there's
[53:34.380 --> 53:36.380]  I've been to multiple shops
[53:36.380 --> 53:38.380]  where there's a giant window in the bud room
[53:38.380 --> 53:40.380]  that looks out on the street
[53:41.380 --> 53:42.380]  and for some reason
[53:42.380 --> 53:45.380]  it hasn't occurred to any regulator
[53:45.380 --> 53:46.380]  or inspector
[53:46.380 --> 53:47.380]  there's one on the way
[53:47.380 --> 53:49.380]  there's a giant fucking window right there
[53:49.380 --> 53:51.380]  on the way to the grow that we managed
[53:51.380 --> 53:52.380]  out there
[53:52.380 --> 53:54.380]  there's a shop on the left side of the road
[53:54.380 --> 53:55.380]  on your way out there
[53:55.380 --> 53:56.380]  that uh
[53:56.380 --> 53:58.380]  there's always a pretty girl standing in the fucking window
[53:58.380 --> 53:59.380]  and it's the bud room
[53:59.380 --> 54:01.380]  she's just standing by the window to get fresh air
[54:01.380 --> 54:02.380]  but there's always
[54:02.380 --> 54:04.380]  one of the pretty girls fucking standing there
[54:04.380 --> 54:05.380]  and I'm like that's the bud room
[54:05.380 --> 54:06.380]  I've been in that dispensary
[54:06.380 --> 54:08.380]  she's gonna weigh the weed right there
[54:08.380 --> 54:09.380]  when a customer comes in
[54:09.380 --> 54:10.380]  and you can see her in the window
[54:10.380 --> 54:12.380]  like it's fucking plain as day
[54:12.380 --> 54:14.380]  and that place only hires pretty girls
[54:14.380 --> 54:16.380]  like if it was up to me
[54:16.380 --> 54:17.380]  that wouldn't be a rule
[54:17.380 --> 54:19.380]  but it is one
[54:19.380 --> 54:20.380]  and I honestly have no idea
[54:20.380 --> 54:22.380]  how they haven't gotten slapped for that yet
[54:23.380 --> 54:24.380]  just
[54:24.380 --> 54:25.380]  especially that place
[54:25.380 --> 54:26.380]  because the MED doesn't like them
[54:27.380 --> 54:28.380]  how many different places
[54:28.380 --> 54:31.380]  don't swap their carbon filters
[54:31.380 --> 54:34.380]  though we were required to filter
[54:34.380 --> 54:36.380]  like everything that leaves the building
[54:37.380 --> 54:39.380]  but there are so many grows
[54:39.380 --> 54:41.380]  that haven't swapped their carbon filters
[54:41.380 --> 54:42.380]  since they built the grow
[54:42.380 --> 54:44.380]  originally four or five years ago
[54:44.380 --> 54:46.380]  15 minutes west of here
[54:46.380 --> 54:48.380]  smells like a fucking skunk
[54:48.380 --> 54:49.380]  like
[54:49.380 --> 54:51.380]  there's a couple of spots in town
[54:51.380 --> 54:52.380]  that are just like
[54:52.380 --> 54:53.380]  oh man
[54:53.380 --> 54:55.380]  those filters are old as fuck
[54:55.380 --> 54:56.380]  if they're even hooked up anymore
[54:56.380 --> 54:57.380]  yeah
[54:57.380 --> 54:58.380]  oh they're not
[54:58.380 --> 54:59.380]  they're bypassing
[54:59.380 --> 55:00.380]  just blowing dank into the road
[55:01.380 --> 55:02.380]  yeah
[55:02.380 --> 55:03.380]  excuse me
[55:03.380 --> 55:04.380]  part of me loves it
[55:04.380 --> 55:05.380]  part of me gringes
[55:05.380 --> 55:07.380]  that's why some of the neighborhood complains
[55:07.380 --> 55:08.380]  that's why granny goes
[55:08.380 --> 55:10.380]  it smells like skunks
[55:10.380 --> 55:11.380]  and we're over here going
[55:11.380 --> 55:13.380]  look how good we stuck up this neighborhood bro
[55:13.380 --> 55:14.380]  like
[55:14.380 --> 55:15.380]  we fucking nailed it
[55:15.380 --> 55:17.380]  I've actually gotten visits from the MED before
[55:17.380 --> 55:18.380]  going hey
[55:18.380 --> 55:19.380]  your grow smells too bad
[55:19.380 --> 55:21.380]  you're gonna need to add more filtration
[55:21.380 --> 55:22.380]  and my answer is
[55:22.380 --> 55:23.380]  how do you know it's us
[55:23.380 --> 55:24.380]  and the MED lady goes
[55:24.380 --> 55:25.380]  I've been here before
[55:25.380 --> 55:26.380]  you guys know what you're doing
[55:26.380 --> 55:27.380]  and I was like
[55:27.380 --> 55:28.380]  well that's kinda
[55:28.380 --> 55:29.380]  that's like the fucking coolest compliment ever I guess
[55:29.380 --> 55:30.380]  you know like
[55:30.380 --> 55:31.380]  fuck you too but thank you
[55:31.380 --> 55:32.380]  like yeah
[55:32.380 --> 55:33.380]  yeah
[55:33.380 --> 55:34.380]  I uh
[55:34.380 --> 55:35.380]  that's so funny
[55:35.380 --> 55:37.380]  we've run into so many people in this industry
[55:37.380 --> 55:38.380]  I uh
[55:39.380 --> 55:40.380]  I've had
[55:40.380 --> 55:42.380]  Department of Ag people call me
[55:42.380 --> 55:43.380]  and ask me like
[55:43.380 --> 55:44.380]  is this something that really
[55:44.380 --> 55:46.380]  somebody told me this and this today
[55:46.380 --> 55:47.380]  is that legit
[55:48.380 --> 55:49.380]  it's like oh yeah
[55:49.380 --> 55:51.380]  or oh definitely not
[55:51.380 --> 55:52.380]  right
[55:52.380 --> 55:54.380]  my favorite is when the Department of Ag
[55:54.380 --> 55:55.380]  would come to inspect our grow
[55:55.380 --> 55:57.380]  and I would have to answer questions for them
[55:58.380 --> 55:59.380]  the one lady was calling her boss
[55:59.380 --> 56:00.380]  to ask a question
[56:00.380 --> 56:01.380]  and I was like no
[56:01.380 --> 56:02.380]  this is the answer here
[56:02.380 --> 56:03.380]  and she was so blown away
[56:03.380 --> 56:05.380]  she was like how do you know that
[56:05.380 --> 56:07.380]  and shout out to a lady named Thea Walker
[56:07.380 --> 56:08.380]  that's how I know that
[56:08.380 --> 56:10.380]  Thea is a bad mama jamma
[56:10.380 --> 56:13.380]  she trains a six hour fucking class
[56:13.380 --> 56:15.380]  at the Colorado State University of Pueblo
[56:15.380 --> 56:16.380]  uh she's
[56:16.380 --> 56:18.380]  yeah at the Colorado State University
[56:18.380 --> 56:19.380]  uh the other one
[56:19.380 --> 56:20.380]  Fort Collins
[56:20.380 --> 56:22.380]  it's a fucking six hour class
[56:22.380 --> 56:24.380]  and she is a really good teacher
[56:24.380 --> 56:25.380]  she's knowledgeable
[56:25.380 --> 56:26.380]  she's a genius
[56:26.380 --> 56:28.380]  and she fucking certified me
[56:28.380 --> 56:29.380]  I'm train the trainer certified
[56:29.380 --> 56:30.380]  for the Department of Ag so
[56:31.380 --> 56:32.380]  yeah I know a lot of shit
[56:32.380 --> 56:34.380]  so I knew more than the Department of Ag rep
[56:34.380 --> 56:35.380]  that was inspecting our building
[56:35.380 --> 56:36.380]  not more
[56:36.380 --> 56:38.380]  but I knew the regulations better than she did
[56:38.380 --> 56:39.380]  which was kinda
[56:39.380 --> 56:40.380]  kinda fun
[56:40.380 --> 56:41.380]  right
[56:41.380 --> 56:42.380]  we were the poster boy bro
[56:42.380 --> 56:44.380]  she used to call us and check in
[56:44.380 --> 56:45.380]  and see how we were doing and shit
[56:45.380 --> 56:46.380]  I loved it
[56:47.380 --> 56:48.380]  you guys take care of the people
[56:48.380 --> 56:49.380]  uh part of being a good
[56:49.380 --> 56:51.380]  if you wanna be a commercial grower
[56:51.380 --> 56:52.380]  people are always like what am I gonna do
[56:52.380 --> 56:53.380]  how do I be a good grower
[56:53.380 --> 56:54.380]  you can grow weed that's easier
[56:54.380 --> 56:55.380]  solitary fucking weirdo
[56:55.380 --> 56:56.380]  go take care of the plants
[56:56.380 --> 56:58.380]  but contractors
[56:58.380 --> 56:59.380]  and fucking Department of Ag
[56:59.380 --> 57:00.380]  and Department of Health
[57:00.380 --> 57:01.380]  and the fire department
[57:01.380 --> 57:02.380]  they're all gonna come knock on the door
[57:02.380 --> 57:03.380]  the police
[57:03.380 --> 57:04.380]  fire department oh
[57:05.380 --> 57:06.380]  yeah
[57:06.380 --> 57:07.380]  be nice to them
[57:07.380 --> 57:08.380]  yeah oh yeah
[57:08.380 --> 57:09.380]  yeah those guys can shut you down immediately
[57:09.380 --> 57:10.380]  the fire marshal gets mad at you
[57:11.380 --> 57:12.380]  just kill yourself
[57:12.380 --> 57:13.380]  the electrical inspector
[57:13.380 --> 57:14.380]  the fire department
[57:14.380 --> 57:15.380]  the fire inspector
[57:15.380 --> 57:16.380]  yeah those guys can shut you down
[57:16.380 --> 57:17.380]  for the dumbest
[57:18.380 --> 57:19.380]  dumbest fucking reasons
[57:20.380 --> 57:21.380]  nope
[57:21.380 --> 57:22.380]  but learn how to talk to those guys too
[57:22.380 --> 57:23.380]  be nice to them
[57:23.380 --> 57:24.380]  be punctual
[57:24.380 --> 57:25.380]  call them sir
[57:25.380 --> 57:26.380]  like step your game up
[57:27.380 --> 57:28.380]  yeah I'll be punctual
[57:29.380 --> 57:30.380]  yeah
[57:30.380 --> 57:31.380]  don't make an inspector wait
[57:32.380 --> 57:33.380]  no cause they'll charge you for the inspection
[57:34.380 --> 57:35.380]  and fucking make you reschedule
[57:35.380 --> 57:36.380]  and not do it
[57:36.380 --> 57:37.380]  yep
[57:37.380 --> 57:38.380]  no they're sitting in the truck
[57:38.380 --> 57:39.380]  and you're not there
[57:39.380 --> 57:40.380]  and those schedules fall until August
[57:40.380 --> 57:41.380]  yeah
[57:41.380 --> 57:42.380]  next August
[57:42.380 --> 57:43.380]  yeah
[57:43.380 --> 57:44.380]  yeah
[57:44.380 --> 57:45.380]  inspectors don't care
[57:45.380 --> 57:46.380]  they just make the shit right
[57:46.380 --> 57:47.380]  or don't
[57:48.380 --> 57:49.380]  I won't say what department he was in
[57:50.380 --> 57:52.380]  but there was a guy
[57:53.380 --> 57:54.380]  that was retiring
[57:55.380 --> 57:56.380]  and so
[57:56.380 --> 57:58.380]  none of the businesses got inspected
[57:58.380 --> 57:59.380]  for like nine months
[57:59.380 --> 58:00.380]  because he was just like
[58:00.380 --> 58:01.380]  fuck that part of my job
[58:01.380 --> 58:02.380]  what are they going to do
[58:02.380 --> 58:03.380]  fire me
[58:03.380 --> 58:04.380]  and just didn't do inspections
[58:04.380 --> 58:05.380]  until he retired
[58:05.380 --> 58:06.380]  and then the dude
[58:06.380 --> 58:07.380]  who took over for him
[58:07.380 --> 58:08.380]  was like
[58:08.380 --> 58:09.380]  why do I have to inspect
[58:09.380 --> 58:10.380]  every business in town
[58:11.380 --> 58:12.380]  none of them have been inspected
[58:12.380 --> 58:13.380]  in the last year
[58:13.380 --> 58:14.380]  alright
[58:15.380 --> 58:16.380]  we got lucky
[58:16.380 --> 58:17.380]  that held a lot of people up
[58:18.380 --> 58:19.380]  we got lucky in a facility
[58:19.380 --> 58:20.380]  because there was a hot water heater
[58:20.380 --> 58:21.380]  installed
[58:21.380 --> 58:22.380]  just kind of on a
[58:23.380 --> 58:24.380]  it was
[58:24.380 --> 58:25.380]  it was close
[58:25.380 --> 58:26.380]  yeah well you know who did it
[58:26.380 --> 58:27.380]  yeah
[58:27.380 --> 58:28.380]  yeah
[58:28.380 --> 58:29.380]  I mean
[58:29.380 --> 58:30.380]  those guys were the redo crew
[58:30.380 --> 58:31.380]  instead of the build it crew
[58:31.380 --> 58:32.380]  they had to come back twice for everything
[58:33.380 --> 58:34.380]  but we got lucky
[58:34.380 --> 58:35.380]  because that inspector
[58:35.380 --> 58:36.380]  that didn't give a shit about his job
[58:36.380 --> 58:37.380]  the one that was like
[58:37.380 --> 58:38.380]  you're going to have to go inspect everything
[58:38.380 --> 58:39.380]  he showed up and he's like
[58:39.380 --> 58:40.380]  where's the hot water heater
[58:40.380 --> 58:41.380]  and I go it's up there
[58:41.380 --> 58:42.380]  and he goes
[58:42.380 --> 58:43.380]  I'm not climbing the fucking ladder
[58:43.380 --> 58:44.380]  that looks fine
[58:44.380 --> 58:45.380]  sign
[58:45.380 --> 58:46.380]  and I was like we signed this one too
[58:46.380 --> 58:47.380]  I think you need to sign this paper
[58:47.380 --> 58:48.380]  and he goes what's this for
[58:48.380 --> 58:49.380]  and I go I don't know
[58:49.380 --> 58:50.380]  they told me to have you sign both of them
[58:50.380 --> 58:51.380]  and I got him to sign off for extra shit
[58:51.380 --> 58:52.380]  in the construction at the same time
[58:52.380 --> 58:53.380]  just because he didn't care
[58:53.380 --> 58:54.380]  I was just like
[58:54.380 --> 58:55.380]  sign here too sir
[58:55.380 --> 58:56.380]  and he's like scribble scribble
[58:56.380 --> 58:57.380]  and I was like thank you
[58:57.380 --> 58:58.380]  like there you go
[58:58.380 --> 58:59.380]  and I just got two of our inspections passed
[58:59.380 --> 59:00.380]  in that building
[59:00.380 --> 59:01.380]  that I'm not even involved in now
[59:01.380 --> 59:02.380]  but that was pretty smooth
[59:02.380 --> 59:03.380]  that guy didn't give a shit dude
[59:04.380 --> 59:05.380]  did not give a shit
[59:06.380 --> 59:07.380]  he didn't even press hard enough
[59:07.380 --> 59:08.380]  to fucking sign the paper completely
[59:09.380 --> 59:10.380]  he was just like
[59:10.380 --> 59:11.380]  job done going home
[59:12.380 --> 59:13.380]  beer in truck
[59:13.380 --> 59:14.380]  see you bye bye
[59:15.380 --> 59:16.380]  and I've had the other kind of inspection
[59:16.380 --> 59:17.380]  where they're like
[59:17.380 --> 59:18.380]  no we want to weigh it too
[59:19.380 --> 59:20.380]  yep
[59:20.380 --> 59:21.380]  we want to smell the water
[59:21.380 --> 59:22.380]  that comes out of that pipe
[59:22.380 --> 59:23.380]  yeah
[59:23.380 --> 59:24.380]  pull the bag out of that pipe
[59:24.380 --> 59:25.380]  yeah
[59:25.380 --> 59:26.380]  pull the bag out of that trash can
[59:26.380 --> 59:27.380]  let's check the bottom of the can
[59:27.380 --> 59:28.380]  ah
[59:28.380 --> 59:29.380]  how about
[59:29.380 --> 59:30.380]  I know this show is off the fucking rails
[59:30.380 --> 59:31.380]  you guys
[59:31.380 --> 59:32.380]  perfect what I wanted for
[59:32.380 --> 59:33.380]  I triggered Mike with this shit
[59:33.380 --> 59:34.380]  it's my fault
[59:34.380 --> 59:35.380]  this is what we really
[59:35.380 --> 59:36.380]  was shopping for
[59:36.380 --> 59:37.380]  ah
[59:37.380 --> 59:40.380]  the people that come to inspect the scales
[59:41.380 --> 59:43.380]  if anybody's got OCD
[59:43.380 --> 59:45.380]  it's the people who inspect
[59:45.380 --> 59:47.380]  fucking scales dude
[59:47.380 --> 59:49.380]  they come in with
[59:49.380 --> 59:50.380]  ah
[59:50.380 --> 59:51.380]  it's like
[59:51.380 --> 59:52.380]  the coolest set
[59:52.380 --> 59:53.380]  but it's in a case this big
[59:54.380 --> 59:55.380]  yeah
[59:55.380 --> 59:56.380]  it's like
[59:56.380 --> 59:57.380]  and they pull out these little
[59:57.380 --> 59:58.380]  they put gloves on
[59:58.380 --> 59:59.380]  these little white gloves
[59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380]  and they take out these little
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.380]  tweezers
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.380]  and they pull the weights
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.380]  out of the weight case with tweezers
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:07.380]  and they fucking dust your scale off
[01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:08.380]  and they blew air into it
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:09.380]  with the air sprayer
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.380]  and they calibrated it like 14 times
[01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:13.380]  and certified our scale
[01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:15.380]  it had to have taken
[01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.380]  four fucking hours
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:17.380]  to certify our scales
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380]  like
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380]  yeah
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.380]  the more scales you have
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.380]  the longer that dude's there
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:23.380]  and
[01:00:24.380 --> 01:00:26.380]  I can't remember if it's once a year
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.380]  twice a year
[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:29.380]  or once every other year
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.380]  it was too often
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.380]  because he takes so fucking long
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.380]  I was like are we paying this guy hourly
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.380]  because
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:38.380]  like he's fucking
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.380]  the
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.380]  in the dispensaries
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.380]  they have to be certified
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:44.380]  really frequently
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:46.380]  and it would shut the bedroom
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.380]  parts of the bedroom down for
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.380]  all
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:50.380]  oh yeah
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:51.380]  all day
[01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:52.380]  he takes the weights
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380]  scale the scale the scale
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.380]  out of a little container
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.380]  out of like a
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.380]  it looks like when you got a drill
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.380]  a bunch of drill bits
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.380]  but the weights are in
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.380]  those little drill bit holders
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:03.380]  so you got like
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:04.380]  yeah socket set
[01:01:04.380 --> 01:01:05.380]  that's similar to what I'm thinking
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:06.380]  but they're all wrapped in a little
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.380]  fucking fabric package too
[01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:10.380]  because you can't get any moisture on them
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:12.380]  moisture and fucking
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.380]  like if I
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.380]  if I sneeze at it
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:16.380]  that'll make it way different
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:18.380]  like this is point one
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.380]  and point one is so light
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:20.380]  so like
[01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:21.380]  and this is point two
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.380]  and this is point three
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.380]  and he cleans them off
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:24.380]  as he gets them out
[01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:25.380]  he's got this little rag
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:26.380]  and he fucking cleans them off
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.380]  and then he puts them on the scale
[01:01:27.380 --> 01:01:28.380]  and he cleans it again
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.380]  and puts it on the scale again
[01:01:30.380 --> 01:01:31.380]  and I'm like bro
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.380]  that scale's accurate
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.380]  like
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.380]  I'd put my money on it
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:36.380]  like fucking move the fuck on dude
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.380]  like
[01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:38.380]  it just
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.380]  I don't know
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:40.380]  it was just making my blood boil
[01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.380]  watching him take fucking
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:42.380]  four hours to calibrate
[01:01:42.380 --> 01:01:43.380]  six fucking scales
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.380]  watching him do the
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.380]  the hanging scale
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.380]  that we weighed
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.380]  harvest the plants on
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.380]  like
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.380]  the scale unit itself
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.380]  looks like
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.380]  kind of like a game boy
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.380]  with a metal hook
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.380]  hanging out of one end
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:00.380]  and then it's zip tied
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380]  to a metal bar
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:02.380]  that's on a rolling
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380]  like a
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.380]  if you had a closet bar
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.380]  on a roll rack
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:07.380]  or a doorway
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.380]  or rolled around
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.380]  so the rack itself
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.380]  is framed out
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:15.380]  maybe five feet tall
[01:02:15.380 --> 01:02:17.380]  six foot long
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.380]  the whole thing's coated
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:20.380]  in trichomes
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.380]  and parts of plant leaves
[01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:24.380]  and little bit of dirt
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.380]  the wheels on it
[01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:26.380]  are all fucked up
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:27.380]  and janky
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.380]  and coated with shit
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.380]  and
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:30.380]  this poor kid's
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.380]  trying
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:33.380]  trying to get it to weigh
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.380]  whatever
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.380]  on the
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.380]  oh man
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:37.380]  he was not amused
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.380]  I was not amused
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:40.380]  it was taking so long
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.380]  we were trying not to lose it on each other
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:43.380]  cause
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:45.380]  and that scale sucks
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.380]  that day sucked
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:47.380]  it's a fish scale
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.380]  that day sucked
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.380]  that's kinda what that resembles
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:51.380]  yeah but
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:52.380]  the digital fish scale
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:54.380]  yeah
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.380]  yeah so

[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:11.380]  nope

[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:13.380]  and how much you go play
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:14.380]  with one of the other 6.9 billion

[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:23.380]  I don't even have any negative to them
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380]  I don't even have a feeling at them
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.380]  I'm too busy for like

[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.380]  no
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.380]  nothing
[01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:16.380]  just a little cracked
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:17.380]  it's all good
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.380]  it's all much better
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.380]  sprinkle a little crack on it
[01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:20.380]  yep
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:21.380]  yeah
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.380]  put a little crack on it
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:23.380]  all right
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:24.380]  just a little crack
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:25.380]  uh
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.380]  there's a Thai food restaurant
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.380]  in Colorado Springs
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:28.380]  that
[01:15:28.380 --> 01:15:29.380]  there's nothing like it
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:30.380]  so I know what you mean
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.380]  like I've eaten
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.380]  at a million Thai food places
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:33.380]  and I'm like
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.380]  can we just go there
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:35.380]  why are we wasting our time
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.380]  there's the one
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380]  like I found it
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:38.380]  in college I would
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.380]  not routinely
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:40.380]  because I couldn't afford it routinely
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.460]  So funny when you said Boulder, I was like, it's the Fox, the bird.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:47.620]  Yep. Yep. Uh, Baba, two beef kiddos. Like, yep.
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:51.300]  Let's fucking seal Baba at each other. They both called each other Baba.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:55.020]  Baba to falafel hummus Baba. No hot sauce. Like let's fucking,
[01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:58.820]  all you heard in that place. Miss it, dude. Miss it.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:02.500]  Shout out to the smelly deli on the Hills and Boulder.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.060]  It's the place bro. Mike, what else you got for us, man?
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.780]  We've been going for a long fucking time. This is a really good podcast.
[01:16:09.100 --> 01:16:11.940]  That's what I was just thinking when you said we're trying to do more content.
[01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:13.620]  I was like, fuck, we could split this show.
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:19.100]  Instead of, uh, there's no grown knowledge or there's some nuggets hidden in
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:21.340]  here, but instead of giving them fucking two Rambo box shows,
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:24.980]  we'll just get one really long Rambo cast. There's some couple,
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.260]  we could drop for people who are still listening.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.420]  I know you people are still listening.
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:36.380]  You'd love to come up with something good, bro. Cause you're on the spot now,
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.340]  man.
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:42.540]  I'm on patreon.com slash grow from your heart. Yeah. Blazed entire.
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.980]  Look at my eyes. My eyes usually aren't this red on this podcast.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:46.260]  They're nice and toasty red.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:51.620]  That dab of the honey banana and bananas foster really put a fucking twist on my
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:52.900]  day. That was kind of nice.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:58.940]  If, uh, if you've got ideas for what should be behind me,
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:02.020]  feel free to hit me up on social media, whichever one you want to attack.
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:05.220]  You want my Twitter email, the show,
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:09.660]  or put it up on Facebook, put it up on YouTube. What should be behind me?
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:13.260]  I'm just need to get you just a plain colored background, bro. Dark,
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:18.380]  plain black background. You, uh, you sent me the link for would be work. Perfect.
[01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:22.220]  I just need to get it ordered and get it attached to my ceiling.
[01:17:22.460 --> 01:17:25.260]  There you go. That's patreon.com forward slash white mic.
[01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.300]  He'll order that background. And if he doesn't do it soon,
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.820]  I'll buy it for him. So he looks good on the show.
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:32.380]  Add a couple of lights down here. Make it a little less dingy.
[01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:34.740]  I'm just trying to blur out.
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:39.020]  My kid's got space behind me and I'm just blurring out his stuff with darkness.
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:41.260]  Oh bro. We're okay with the kids toys. Uh,
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:43.380]  somebody told me and I won't shout that I'll shout them out.
[01:17:43.380 --> 01:17:45.260]  Shout out to the person said looks militant.
[01:17:45.260 --> 01:17:47.900]  Cause I got a flag behind me and I'm coming up all raw stuff. All right,
[01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:49.900]  it's time for the show. Uh, there are,
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:54.580]  there are plans in the future to change some background stuff, but you know,
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:56.460]  time's coming. Time's coming.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:18:00.260]  Yup. I got all self-conscious looking at backgrounds. I was like, Oh,
[01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:03.140]  I like that one, but I don't know if I can put that behind me or Ooh,
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:04.340]  there's a good three 11 one,
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:08.260]  but I don't know if the band wants my opinions on top of their logo.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:12.100]  Yeah. Don't do the band one. Do the, we'll get you a plain color one.
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:14.900]  We'll get you that plain color thing. Flat black, flat gray,
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:18.180]  one light green in a corner coming at you. You'll look good.
[01:18:18.900 --> 01:18:20.620]  Make you look like fumidor. You'll be all right.
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:26.220]  Shout out to fumidor, chibidor and the Portland cannabis tasting society.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.060]  I think I got that right.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:30.780]  I think I got that right. Yeah.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.060]  Even if that's not the right group, so that's a fucking cool group.
[01:18:38.420 --> 01:18:40.340]  Oh, dabs are fun.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.660]  Dabs are amazing. Dabs have gotten us a long way.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:47.460]  I think that's how we started a lot of this ramble cast was talking about,
[01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.340]  how this COVID has, how dabs have gotten us through COVID.
[01:18:50.380 --> 01:18:53.980]  So we looped it all the way back around. Mike, you're a good storyteller.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:59.180]  My little project listeners that are still with us. I'm gonna,
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:04.260]  I've got to clean up and reset up my tabletop Buddha vape to go with a nice
[01:19:04.260 --> 01:19:08.900]  hockey puck of some bubble hash. I was gifted old school bubble bag,
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.820]  bubble hash pressed into a puck.
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:13.900]  Like it's 94.
[01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:17.660]  Reminds me of a guy that used to pop up in that old dispensary.
[01:19:17.860 --> 01:19:20.460]  He brought me a big old puck of bubble hash one time.
[01:19:21.780 --> 01:19:25.100]  These, uh, it was out of nowhere. I ran into an old friend of mine.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.980]  It was like, Hey, I ran into a guy that makes these. You want one?
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:30.220]  I've got like six with me. I said, sure.
[01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.420]  It was like, wait a second. I said, sure to this.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:37.140]  Now I've got this beautiful puck of hash. What am I going to do with it?
[01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.300]  I just moved. Where's that vape again?
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:44.620]  Get my vape out and get it cleaned. Get it set back up again.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.700]  Hopefully it still works.
[01:19:45.860 --> 01:19:48.540]  So is your intention just to put the bubble hash,
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:51.660]  kind of break it off the chunk, break it up into kind of smaller pieces.
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:54.940]  So it's got more surface area and then just put it directly into the wand part
[01:19:54.940 --> 01:19:55.780]  of the vape?
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:20:01.060]  Yeah. The, the vape loads up a lot like a pipe would.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.260]  So you're going to have to get it out of the pipe.
[01:20:03.260 --> 01:20:04.780]  You're going to have to get it out of the pipe.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.220]  You're going to have to get it out of the pipe.
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:07.740]  You're going to have to get it out of the pipe.
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:11.620]  Like a pipe would screen in it.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:12.660]  You throw some,
[01:20:13.180 --> 01:20:18.020]  I usually break off like two green peas worth of
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.700]  hash and throw those size chunks in there.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.660]  Do a couple of draws with it hooked up to the heating element so that the hash
[01:20:26.660 --> 01:20:31.540]  softens and then get in there with a dab tool or a paper clip
[01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:36.820]  and give it a stir and really open up that surface area and your next three or
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:40.460]  four poles. It's like it hit the face of the shovel.
[01:20:40.580 --> 01:20:41.420]  Perfect.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.260]  It's wonderful.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:45.660]  Yeah. We're going to have to get you some solventless to try like that as well.
[01:20:46.620 --> 01:20:47.660]  Yeah. I, uh,
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.900]  And the bubble hash is solventless, but I mean some like some SHO,
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.220]  some salt solventless honey oil. It looks like batter.
[01:20:55.140 --> 01:20:58.460]  It's hard with COVID and the fucking plague going on,
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:21:03.500]  but I'd like to hit a handful of shops and really do just kind of a
[01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:07.020]  tour of Southern Colorado and see what people have for concentrate.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:10.980]  That's not BHO or solvent extracts,
[01:21:10.980 --> 01:21:14.100]  something that would actually work in that, that tabletop vape.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:16.180]  For a while,
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:20.740]  there were a bunch of different companies doing bubble or key
[01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:22.020]  for dry sift.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.620]  And they had a number of different products on the market,
[01:21:25.620 --> 01:21:28.700]  but for the last couple of years, I mean, I haven't been looking,
[01:21:29.220 --> 01:21:32.700]  but it seems to me like most of the shops have moved to,
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.740]  um, solvent extract.
[01:21:34.940 --> 01:21:38.940]  Yeah. Diamonds and sauce. There's a lot of a solventless out there. Uh,
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:43.060]  solventless like Rosin and, uh, solventless honey oil, press stuff.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:46.420]  That's out there. That's in big demand, but it's expensive right now. Uh,
[01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:49.300]  that's like its own special niche. I talk about, uh,
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:53.580]  talk about auto flowers being like the seed hoarders and collectors are a
[01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:56.780]  special group of nerds, but then auto flowers and then like land raise,
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:00.540]  those are your special niches. Uh, that's like there's concentrate smokers,
[01:22:00.660 --> 01:22:01.900]  there's fucking connoisseurs,
[01:22:02.060 --> 01:22:04.740]  but then there's the fucking heady heady boys that are smoking the fucking
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.260]  solventless and just like 90 a gram and shit. But it's out there.
[01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:15.300]  I had a friend on Facebook, a real world friend post up,
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:19.300]  you know, Hey, I live in Arizona now. How the fuck y'all get ice cream home here?
[01:22:19.940 --> 01:22:22.660]  And I just started laughing and I was like, Oh girl,
[01:22:23.180 --> 01:22:26.300]  if you can't figure out how to get ice cream home, like we're trying to move 50,
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:30.140]  80, 90 gram hash home at a hundred degree heat.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.900]  Yeah. You can't be having that shit melt in the car.
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.980]  These people show up to the fucking dispensary with a cooler. Yeah.
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.460]  Yup. Last two times I've gone to a dispensary, man, ice packs in the cooler.
[01:22:40.980 --> 01:22:43.460]  It's the only way to fly. Yup. It's,
[01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.740]  I'm not going to drop 200 on hash and get home and have it all glued into a
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:51.260]  corner. Yeah. Nope. Not again. Uh, that's why people,
[01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:52.220]  sometimes when I show up,
[01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:56.100]  people ask me if I'm grub hub because I carry a white cooler with me.
[01:22:56.700 --> 01:23:00.180]  I've got the white cooler with me because I've got a couple of water bottles in
[01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:02.260]  there that are frozen. Now they're keeping everything cool.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:06.180]  I got a can of butane in there. I got a torch. I got a rig.
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.020]  My rig is in the cooler because now when it's hot outside,
[01:23:10.020 --> 01:23:12.780]  like it was 104 degrees today, bro.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.380]  Imagine if you left the rig in the car,
[01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:18.140]  the rig is going to be hot as shit when you put it to your mouth.
[01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:21.460]  The glass is going to, ow, 110 degree water. That was fun. Yeah.
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:24.660]  The water is going to be sizzling when you go to steam in your lungs and shit.
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.140]  It's miserable. Now my rig was in the fucking cooler.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.860]  It's like hitting chilled water. It's so nice when you hit it.
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:34.260]  And my concentrates are all nice and fresh. You're in a cooler.
[01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.300]  So that's why I've got a cooler. I'm not grub hub. I'm dab hub.
[01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:44.020]  Yeah. The dispensary is only 15 minutes away from my house,
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:47.980]  but it's 104 degrees. The half hour I'm in the dispensary,
[01:23:48.620 --> 01:23:50.980]  it doesn't matter how cool my car was on the way over there.
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:53.020]  It's fucking hotter than shit when I come out,
[01:23:53.660 --> 01:23:58.020]  but I pop open that cooler, toss my hash inside, grab a nice cold drink,
[01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:04.020]  roll home and comfort. Yep. Hell yeah. Yeah. Life is good, bro.
[01:24:04.540 --> 01:24:05.940]  COVID is weird, man.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:11.260]  I think the first time I left the house in like 15 days was to go to dispensary
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:15.380]  and there were like 10 people waiting in line. It was crowded.
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:19.380]  I had to stop going to one dispensary for a couple of days because they're like,
[01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:23.700]  Hey, um, you're back. Something wrong. I was like, nope. Fucking bored.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.580]  Like I didn't interact with other people.
[01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:30.100]  Why not pick up two more grams while I'm here?
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:31.620]  I wanted to see if my voice works.
[01:24:31.620 --> 01:24:34.180]  I haven't fucking used it in a day and want to see if anybody else could hear
[01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:37.980]  me. Right. Yeah. Talk to someone that wasn't my kids. Right.
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:40.300]  All I did was hand you my ID and say two of these, please.
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.500]  But this was fucking exciting. Yeah. Yep.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:47.140]  Go fucking grocery shopping for like a one item.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.380]  I don't even know what I need, but I'll go find one.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.780]  How about this bottle of kombucha? That looks good. All right.
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.060]  I've been here in the store for 30 minutes.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:56.180]  I should fucking get out of here now.
[01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:00.260]  I just walked around and looked at nothing. Right. I, uh,
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:04.580]  yeah. Whenever I have to leave, I end up dawdling now.
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:07.460]  Like if I run out for, I need one thing,
[01:25:07.900 --> 01:25:10.500]  I'll spend 40 minutes walking around that store going, Oh,
[01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:12.420]  am I sure I don't need a second thing? Yep.
[01:25:12.420 --> 01:25:15.300]  I went to the mall for a pair of shoes the other day and I looked at every store
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:17.740]  in that mall. There were no people there. So it's just like, well,
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:20.620]  we've got them all to ourselves. So we just cruised and fucking shopped.
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:22.860]  It was awesome. Like when we walked into the mall,
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:25.740]  the people in the stores that people like, Hey, welcome. It's so good to see you.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.300]  Can I help you with anything? Would you like to try something?
[01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:28.620]  Like what can I get something off the top shelf?
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:30.420]  Something off the bottom shelf. Would you like that in a different color?
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:32.420]  Like maybe we've got it in the back for you. What were you looking for?
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:34.820]  What's your name? Do you know if any other people may come here today?
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:36.420]  Because, because I feel like I'm not the only one.
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:39.100]  Yeah. Yeah. The mall was fun.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.100]  Oh yeah. I went and tried to,
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:43.100]  I had to go get a propane tank refilled and I ended up getting propane
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:46.100]  accessories. I did not get propane accessories,
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.100]  but I did come home with almost $200 in t-shirts.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:52.100]  One of them better have Hank Hill on it.
[01:25:52.100 --> 01:25:53.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:54.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:56.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:57.100 --> 01:25:58.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:58.100 --> 01:25:59.100]  No, no, no.
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:00.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:00.100 --> 01:26:01.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:02.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:02.100 --> 01:26:03.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:04.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:05.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:05.100 --> 01:26:06.100]  No, no, no.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.780]  No, no, no.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:08.780]  No, no, no.
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.780]  No, no, no.
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:10.780]  No, no, no.
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:11.780]  No, no, no.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.780]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.780]  No.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.780]  No, no, no.
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:16.580]  No, it's just the store that's got the propane refill also has the best
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:17.580]  shirts.
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.380]  So you make it sound like we live next to like,
[01:26:19.380 --> 01:26:21.980]  like the fucking Hickes gas station in town.
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:27.380]  Now we do, we do get propane and shirts at Walmart Big AR.
[01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:29.500]  I, that was my next guest, bro.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:31.500]  That was my next guest.
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:32.500]  Card shirts and propane.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:35.500]  You know, our lives are different.
[01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.180]  I've been trying to keep it that way too.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:39.380]  I've seen opportunities, 200 episodes.
[01:26:39.620 --> 01:26:42.780]  I've seen good opportunities to talk about cannabis and I just flat out
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.540]  refused. I was like, Nope, we're going to go route B for this.
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.700]  It's just been fun. It's been a long show.
[01:26:48.700 --> 01:26:51.220]  We've been going for probably an hour and 25 minutes, bro.
[01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:53.020]  So if you do get tired, I need a break.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:58.020]  I should probably mention that the last two times I bought flour in town,
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.940]  it was trimmed. So people are listening.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:03.860]  They took that advice. Thank you for trimming your shit.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.060]  Yeah. Thank you guys. We do prefer trimmed weed.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:11.100]  Yup. Now, next step, now that we're trimming it,
[01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:13.700]  get rid of the goddamn Boveda packs.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:20.900]  I'm torn on the Boveda packs in the dispensary because that damn jar is open
[01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:25.580]  and closed so many times that I don't know. I kind of, I've gotten,
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:27.140]  do you want to go to the dispensary?
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:28.620]  it's like your options right now and it's,
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.660]  I know it's like fucking shit sandwich or a fucking punch to the balls,
[01:27:32.220 --> 01:27:34.100]  but you take your pick.
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:35.900]  It's a,
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:42.740]  it is a toss up and it is difficult and I don't envy the people that have to
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:47.540]  fight with the humidity levels in the, in the jars, the product, but, um,
[01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:51.180]  the system where the only,
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:53.140]  the only thing we have in common is the,
[01:27:53.140 --> 01:28:02.820]  Um, the system where they open the jar in the morning and select a display nug and that's
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:05.740]  the one they're showing to people and there's a fucking play gone. So it's not like people
[01:28:05.740 --> 01:28:12.300]  are smelling shit now. Right. Um, the, the shops I've been going to lately, they've just
[01:28:12.300 --> 01:28:20.020]  moved a glass display case and they get the jar close to you so that you can see it good,
[01:28:20.020 --> 01:28:24.620]  but you can't smell it cause now you're looking at it through a layer of glass and it's still
[01:28:24.620 --> 01:28:28.900]  in the jar. Um, you don't know what it smells like until you get at home and you open it
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:35.380]  up and take a whiff. But, uh, um, that little display jar that people could smell it, look
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:42.020]  at, um, before the plague hit was, uh, was my favorite method. And then at the end of
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.860]  the day you take that one nug that is gotten dried out from getting snitched by 80 people.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:52.380]  And you throw that back in the, the, the larger jar to rehydrate and even up. And it
[01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:56.700]  keeps the whole jar from getting aired out 15, 20 times a day.
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:03.500]  The other solution is prepackaged dates and people fucking hate prepacks. They think for
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:09.500]  some reason they're going to rip me off. Like bro, it's a dispensary. We're not the fucking,
[01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:13.620]  we're not some shady dealer. We're right here. We're right here on this address every day.
[01:29:13.620 --> 01:29:17.540]  The signs out front, like if you think it doesn't weigh, come back, we'll check it out.
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:18.540]  It'll be all right.
[01:29:18.540 --> 01:29:27.700]  Like the last two prepacks I bought weren't bad. The two before that were crap. Um, but
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:33.420]  I knew what I was getting. It's when you can always tell when it's half the price it's
[01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:39.100]  supposed to be. There's a reason. Um, and if it's in a store, that reason's probably
[01:29:39.100 --> 01:29:45.100]  not because it's stolen. It's probably because it's shitty. So if it's in an alley, it could
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.100]  go either way.
[01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:49.700]  One of my favorite shops in Denver, it doesn't exist anymore, but they've one of the, some
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:53.900]  of the regulations they gave up, but they were one of the first that I appreciated their
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:59.580]  prepack because they were slamming busy and I don't need, I don't need, the reason we
[01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:03.820]  used to weigh our weed in front of each other is because I don't trust you. And you want
[01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:08.120]  to see that it says 3.5 on the scale and you want to know that. And I'm going to count
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:12.240]  your money. You're going to watch the scale. That's how business works. It's a dispensary.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.280]  I don't have, they do weigh your meat. If you go to the butcher, but you don't get your
[01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:18.560]  cereal weighed in front of you. You don't get everything weighed on front of you. It
[01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:23.440]  comes in cans and boxes and you trust that it says eight ounces fucking on the package.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:27.560]  I think cannabis is we're there with the cannabis. So, uh, it's so much quicker. There'd be a
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.480]  line out the door at this place cause they were the slamming this dispensary and it was
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:34.760]  a little tiny shit shack of a shop and they would just spend all night pre-weigh and shit
[01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:39.040]  so that tomorrow the shop can flow instead of fucking two bud tenders center going 3.5
[01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:44.120]  again, 3.5 again. What do you want? An eighth of this, an eighth of this. Okay. 3.5 seal
[01:30:44.120 --> 01:30:47.920]  it up, put a sticker on it, put the jar away, get the other jar out. Nah, they sat there
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:52.080]  all night or there's somebody in the back right now is weighing out this whole pound
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.240]  will be eights. And if you want eights, we got them. If you want a quarter, you get two
[01:30:55.240 --> 01:30:58.800]  eights. If you want an ounce, you got eight eights. Like they just sat there busting them
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:02.600]  out. It's way better. I think it's way more efficient and the product stays fresh.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.440]  Vastly more efficient, but
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.640]  they didn't weigh out my concentrates in front of me and I trust them.
[01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:20.640]  Fuck out of me. I, uh, it's not that it's not going to weigh when it's, um, the last
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:27.560]  two I bought, they were in a clear packaging. It looked, I mean it was a different shape,
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:32.560]  but it was essentially the packaging. You get a cheap toothbrush in, like there was
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:40.360]  a backing to it and then it had a clear plastic bubble that was full of herb and it was Colorado
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.080]  packaging compliance. So it was a bitch to open and yada, yada, yada. But you could see
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:52.560]  into the pack and tell that it was quality looking herb that was well trimmed and not
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:58.760]  all stems. And the, the two that I pre-packs that I bought before that, that were bad,
[01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:05.680]  both of them were like little pebble nugs, little gravel size nugs and had fucking
[01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:06.800]  fan leaf in it.
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:17.640]  Not sugar leaf, not wasn't trimmed well, actual chunks of fan leaf and in the pre
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:24.040]  package tins, chunks of fan leaf and then huge sticks for no reason. Like there's a
[01:32:24.040 --> 01:32:30.880]  little popcorn nug on the end and then a long stick for no reason. It's like, why is this
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:37.320]  in my container? A packager did this on purpose. They should be fired. Yeah. You know, just
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:42.760]  not accept. The first time you end up with that, it's so hard to buy a pre-pack after
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:50.040]  that. My experience with pre-rolls three, four years ago are why I haven't had a pre-roll
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.800]  in three or four years. Like it's just, I can't trust it.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:58.720]  I don't like when people go to the dispensary and buy the cheapest product in the store
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.880]  and then leave a bad review based on the cheapest product they could have fucking bought.
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.840]  That drives me crazy. I bought a pre-roll and it tastes terrible. It was one of the $2
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:09.680]  pre-rolls. Well, bro, what did you expect?
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:10.200]  What did you want?
[01:33:10.360 --> 01:33:13.800]  Yeah, they didn't put the gold on the fucking bottom shelf for two bucks. You got to buy
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:16.560]  at least a middle shelf product to leave a quality review.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:24.400]  The only time I really, really supported that complaint was when a shop was doing, if you're
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:30.120]  a veteran, you get a pre-roll for, I can't remember if it was a penny, a dime or a quarter
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:36.760]  or a dollar. I think it was a quarter. It was stupid cheap for a pre-roll. It was seven
[01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:41.600]  or eight or $9 cheaper than anywhere else. But you had to be a vet to go get the deal.
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:47.440]  And I had more than one vet telling me that they heard about the deal, were excited about
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:55.280]  it, went in and tried it and ended up getting like trim material rolled into a cone.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:02.520]  And they were really pissed that they were getting sold leaf and told it was a standard
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.960]  quality pre-roll from that place. I thought at that point they really had a decent complaint,
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:14.280]  but it was just a regular person. If you ask me for the cheapest shit on the shelf, don't
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.600]  be surprised. It's not also the best quality stuff on the shelf.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:21.040]  Cheapest shit on the shelf. You just reminded me of a random, I'll go ahead and I'm going
[01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:23.280]  to write down my topic, but you keep going and I'll take a dab.
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:31.120]  I saw a shop this spring that they had their normal jars on the shelf and a couple of
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:35.920]  managers, special sales or whatever. But one of the shelves, there was a jar that was marked
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:42.400]  special with a sign that said last year's outdoor seated. And then it was 50 an ounce.
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:48.400]  Instead, I think their next cheapest out the door ounce was 89.99 or 99 bucks or whatever.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:53.120]  So it was substantially cheaper per gram or whatever per ounce.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.880]  But you knew what you were getting going in.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:35:00.680]  It wasn't like you'd get it home and discover that it was. That's why it was cheaper.
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:02.200]  Yeah, that's legit. If you tell me.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:04.920]  And I saw that and I was like, why is that hard?
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.240]  Why can't other people just be up front like that?
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:11.720]  It's so easy to just throw that up on the side and let people know.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:18.120]  For those of you not watching on YouTube, Jeff's taking a nice size dab here.
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:20.520]  Really pretty butter.
[01:35:21.160 --> 01:35:22.480]  Nice big dab.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.760]  Nice big vapor cloud.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.120]  He's going to be quiet for a minute while that goes to his brain.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.680]  So I'll just keep rambling.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:34.880]  If you need a rescue, I totally have a good ramble.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:37.280]  You just gave me two good topics.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:40.520]  We had a jar show up at a dispensary and we didn't know what it's called.
[01:35:41.520 --> 01:35:42.760]  Random weed in a baggie.
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:44.240]  Somebody forgot to label it.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:45.320]  You know, stoned owners.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:47.960]  I labeled it Stinky Peter.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:50.680]  And that sounds like somebody's name right now.
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.160]  Sounds like a guy named Stinky Peter.
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:55.160]  Until the first customer, everyone's like, why'd you call it Stinky Peter?
[01:35:55.960 --> 01:35:59.280]  The first customer came in and said, can I smell your stink?
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.880]  They stopped themselves and everybody heard it and they fucking thought it was great.
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:06.280]  Can I smell your Stinky Peter?
[01:36:06.520 --> 01:36:08.800]  Was said so many, can I check out your Stinky Peter?
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.440]  That phrase happened so many times throughout the day and it was well worth
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.880]  putting that fucking label on the jar.
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:15.960]  Stinky Peter.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:17.720]  Uh, it was a discount jar.
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:19.600]  We gave it Stinky Peter out for super cheap.
[01:36:20.120 --> 01:36:25.320]  Um, I have a really reliable source in the cannabis packaging industry.
[01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:31.480]  Big shout out to one of the best cannabis packagers in the fucking weed game.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:33.560]  She doesn't need her name said she knows who she is.
[01:36:33.880 --> 01:36:34.440]  I'm proud of you.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.320]  She's kicking ass.
[01:36:35.760 --> 01:36:41.120]  Uh, she may have told me that there is a national cone shortage.
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.600]  Raw cannot provide cones because of the company, the factory that makes
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.560]  them is shut down due to Corona.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:54.560]  So the pre-rolls and cones are out for them at their grow at their facility.
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:55.240]  They don't have any more.
[01:36:55.240 --> 01:36:56.760]  That's fucked.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:58.080]  They can't order anymore.
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:02.640]  And pretty soon that will ripple out to other States and areas.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.480]  My lighting just went weird in the camera.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.080]  That was strange.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:09.640]  Uh, but yeah, pre-rolls are fucking, they can't get any cones, dude.
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:17.080]  The, the ripples from COVID are going to keep bouncing coast to coast for,
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:24.280]  honestly, I'd put my money on Christmas next year is the earliest.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.280]  We're going to really head back to normal to what it was like in the middle of 2019.
[01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:37.280]  Um, but every day it seems like I hear about a new one where somebody's like,
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.480]  can't get watermelons.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.800]  It's like, why not?
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:42.760]  It's like, cause the trucks that ship them don't have tires.
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:46.120]  Cause the tire factory, there's so many of those.
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:46.600]  Yeah.
[01:37:46.720 --> 01:37:50.120]  Um, I was wondering when it was going to really start fucking with the cannabis
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:50.720]  industry.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:58.200]  Um, immediately I kind of smiled because like, I really doubt they're doing their
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:03.280]  gorilla inspections now where they go hit 55 shops in a day.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:04.040]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.080]  There are growth in any industry.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  There are shortages of soil.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.000]  You can't get soil deliveries right now.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.840]  Uh, soil is short.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:13.000]  Nutrients are short.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:14.080]  A lot of shit is short.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:16.000]  All the plastic stuff is in demand.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:22.880]  The, I mean, on the commercial scale, how many different trucks show up every week?
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.920]  It's, it's daunting.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.520]  It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's,
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:33.760]  it, it's daunting.
[01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.800]  Um, there's a truck guy, there's a nutrients guy, there's a pots guy, there's a
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.680]  piping guy.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:42.440]  There's some places have a water guy.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:43.000]  Yeah.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:46.000]  Um, there's a CO2 guy, CO2 guy that falls asleep.
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:50.680]  Um, so many different deliveries.
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:57.000]  If any part of that chain hitches, like your CO2 guy can't come for a couple of
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.280]  weeks, that's going to fuck up your harvest.
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:38:59.800]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:03.200]  Your harvest is your harvest is 30% smaller than it was last time.
[01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:04.840]  That's going to fuck with your store supply.
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.560]  You can't get soil delivered or cocoa delivered.
[01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:08.440]  I can't cones.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:10.440]  Dude, the cones are really going to fuck with people.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:16.120]  There's whole dispensary outfits whose sole business is based on cones existing.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:19.960]  I know a couple of people who their jobs are to roll cones all day.
[01:39:20.520 --> 01:39:21.160]  That's what they do.
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.640]  I just read an article, some dispensary somewhere, not in Colorado, it was in
[01:39:27.640 --> 01:39:34.640]  another state just had to, to, um, destroy thousands of free rolls.
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.360]  Totally fake.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:36.400]  The chick was licking.
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:38.520]  I think that's totally fair to you.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.520]  Guarantee you.
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:42.880]  Um, there's another one where they have to toss.
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:48.920]  It was $2.6 million of cartridges and that the company's destroying it.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:50.040]  Cause they won't move.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.840]  And they're trash now because the, the market base has no confidence that the
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:02.280]  state can, um, test for, I think in that state, the big fear is led.
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:09.880]  Um, but coming off all of the vaping for from last year, it was clearly
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.320]  a cutting agent in the cartridges.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.160]  So yeah, what happened to that?
[01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:20.280]  Some cartridges just sit the, we got murder Hornets, tiger King murder
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:24.880]  Hornets, COVID, and we forgot all about fucking vape carts killing people.
[01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:28.680]  I think what happened predominantly now, the little kids are in
[01:40:28.680 --> 01:40:30.400]  wayfair cabinets, that's what happened.
[01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:38.960]  Um, I think the black market vape business just, they got hit hard.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.320]  And the, anyone's still surviving in that marketplace has drastically
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.240]  re uh, restructured their business model.
[01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:52.600]  They might have had to, I had a friend that would buy, allegedly I knew a guy
[01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:57.560]  whose twin brother's cousin would buy packaging that looks just like that.
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:41:00.320]  You can order that packaging on a website.
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.480]  I won't say the name of the website.
[01:41:01.480 --> 01:41:07.000]  You can buy that exact packaging and you can buy those carts and they're empty.
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:12.160]  And allegedly I knew a guy that in another state, his hustle was to buy
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.880]  carts that look like that and fill them up with his homemade oil and sell
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:19.960]  them as that brand's carts for a fucking premium price in an illegal state.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:25.160]  And then all this scare of fucking carts came out and his business went to zero.
[01:41:25.320 --> 01:41:25.820]  Yep.
[01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:30.480]  There's a, it doesn't surprise me at all.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:36.960]  Um, unless you can be sure that you're buying a regulated, safe, inspected,
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:43.840]  tested, um, if it fucks me up, there's a method for me to be like, why did you do
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.440]  that, Jeff?
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.760]  Like you can track it back to whoever.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.300]  Yeah.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.920]  We can see which plant it came from.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.640]  We could see which facility it was made in.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.800]  Uh, I'd be shocked if that's still a thing.
[01:41:54.800 --> 01:41:57.080]  And that's clearly where all the nasty carts were coming from.
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:00.880]  I've got some numbers on the back here.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:04.160]  I don't know which one is which, but I could see the, uh, the growth facility,
[01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:07.080]  the processing facility, and a couple other numbers on here.
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:09.160]  So if something went wrong with this, I would know who to contact.
[01:42:09.760 --> 01:42:11.240]  Be pretty easy process.
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:14.920]  The distributor number, the processing lab number and the grow
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:16.960]  number and batch number.
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:17.820]  Yep.
[01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:19.020]  It's all right there on the back.
[01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:19.660]  Yeah.
[01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:22.140]  So you'd call the dispensary or go there and say, Hey, this is moldy.
[01:42:22.620 --> 01:42:26.180]  And then fucking call the producer or just roll down the chain.
[01:42:26.700 --> 01:42:27.060]  Yep.
[01:42:27.060 --> 01:42:30.660]  They'd probably just give you a free one, but you know, it was worse than that.
[01:42:31.820 --> 01:42:34.740]  I've rolled up one for a penny because you can't do free in Colorado.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:35.480]  That's true.
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.500]  Uh, Mike, I'm stoned and fucking running out of energy, but I'm getting tired.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:41.860]  You want to start wrapping up this fucking ramble fest?
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:43.820]  Yeah, we went for long enough.
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:46.420]  It's been a beautiful podcast.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:49.180]  This has been an immense pleasure, Jeffrey.
