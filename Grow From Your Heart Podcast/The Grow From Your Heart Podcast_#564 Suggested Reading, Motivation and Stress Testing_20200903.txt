[00:59.980 --> 01:05.500]  now.com. Welcome to the podcast, everybody. I'm sure you noticed a brand new intro track.
[01:05.500 --> 01:09.740]  My friend Joss DeFarra sent that in several weeks ago. I really love that track. I wanted
[01:09.740 --> 01:13.140]  to make sure to play it on the show. You may hear that again. You may not, you may
[01:13.140 --> 01:16.820]  hear some different intro submissions. You never know what could happen around here.
[01:16.820 --> 01:20.860]  I wanted to make sure to get that on the show because I really like it. I am kind of amazed
[01:20.860 --> 01:26.140]  that it took so long to find somebody submit an entry with a reggae air horn at the start.
[01:26.140 --> 01:30.540]  That was perfect. I exactly what I expected right what I was looking for. I love it. Big
[01:30.540 --> 01:35.180]  shout out to Joss DeFarra for the great intro. Let's not forget about danks for nothing for
[01:35.180 --> 01:39.520]  the regular intro. You will hear that on the next episode. Wanted to make sure to play
[01:39.520 --> 01:45.760]  Joss DeFarra's submission. So support Joss DeFarra on Cannabuzz. Give him a follow. Big
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.800]  thanks once again to my buddy Joss DeFarra for the great intro track. All right, you
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.000]  do know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today. I've
[01:55.000 --> 01:59.620]  been taking dabs of hella tight live batter from Green Dot Labs. This is a blend of Sex
[01:59.620 --> 02:04.520]  on the Beach and Peach Wrecker. The flavor is described as sour and starfruit. I think
[02:04.520 --> 02:09.120]  we've talked about this on the podcast before. It's certainly sour. There's a sweet funky
[02:09.120 --> 02:14.480]  fruitness going on. And there's another terp that is almost sour that I cannot quite describe.
[02:14.480 --> 02:23.040]  I really enjoy it. The package says it contains 60.15% THC and non detectable amounts of CBD.
[02:23.040 --> 02:29.040]  Big shout out to Green Dot Labs for the delicious hella tight live batter. All right, in this
[02:29.040 --> 02:33.560]  episode, I'm going to talk about my breeding project I've been doing. Then I will get into
[02:33.560 --> 02:38.260]  some Patreon questions. Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks
[02:38.260 --> 02:42.980]  who support the show on Patreon at the 710 level or higher. Let's start off with the

[03:58.620 --> 04:03.980]  a recent breeding project update. If you've been following the show, you know that I've
[04:03.980 --> 04:08.300]  been working with a Jack the Ripper male. I acquired some Jack the Ripper seeds out
[04:08.300 --> 04:12.480]  of that package of seeds. I did find a very quality male plant. I was very pleased with
[04:12.480 --> 04:18.160]  his aroma, his structure, his shape, his flowering time. When he started to flower, he smelled
[04:18.160 --> 04:22.100]  a little bit like lime vomit. Like if you had too many margaritas and threw up, that's
[04:22.100 --> 04:26.980]  almost what he sounded like, smelled like. I know that sounds like a disgusting flavor.
[04:26.980 --> 04:30.160]  Disgusting flavors are beautiful when it comes to breeding and selecting male plants for
[04:30.160 --> 04:36.440]  cannabis breeding. I've got the margarita lime, sort of a key lime pie vomit flavored
[04:36.440 --> 04:41.120]  male plant with a beautiful structure. He made a lot of pollen. He pollinated really
[04:41.120 --> 04:45.200]  well. He had a beautiful flower shape and structure. I used him to pollinate several
[04:45.200 --> 04:49.600]  other females. In that room were a couple of other Jack the Ripper females. Number two
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.680]  and four were my favorites. I can't decide which one was the best. Numbers two and four
[04:53.680 --> 05:00.600]  got pollinated. Something I've noticed quite randomly, two and four, if I plant 10, five,
[05:00.600 --> 05:05.320]  25 seeds, numbers two and four, and I don't number them, and they get numbered before
[05:05.320 --> 05:09.720]  anything happens. I put 10 seeds down, I'll label them one, two, three, four, five. Two
[05:09.720 --> 05:13.800]  and four are always fucking killers. I don't know how it works out that way. Always keepers,
[05:13.800 --> 05:17.440]  always champions. But I kept number two and four of the Jack the Ripper. What else is
[05:17.440 --> 05:21.720]  in there? There was a platinum tangy in there. There was a golden goat female in there. There
[05:21.720 --> 05:26.680]  was a blueberry cookies in there. There was a lemon skunk in there. And I put a morning
[05:26.680 --> 05:31.960]  dew plant in there. But for some reason, the morning dew did not make very many seeds.
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.520]  It was right in the line of pollen. It got skeeted on all over. It should have made a
[05:35.520 --> 05:40.520]  lot of seeds. Not very many seeds. The arise also did not make it made some, but not a
[05:40.520 --> 05:45.360]  lot of seeds. I got a shit ton of seeds from the Jack the Ripper females and the blueberry
[05:45.360 --> 05:50.120]  cookies, but a couple of them did not make the desired amount of seeds. Not a big deal.
[05:50.120 --> 05:53.480]  These weren't meant to be a production cross. There's no profit to be made off of these
[05:53.480 --> 05:57.440]  seeds. These will be testers. These will be sent out to friends. I'll grow them. We'll
[05:57.440 --> 06:01.280]  see if they're worth a shit. We'll grow all these out, find out if we made gems or if
[06:01.280 --> 06:07.120]  we made turds. If it's something I feel is worth contributing to the future of cannabis,
[06:07.120 --> 06:11.320]  then we may release those seeds through the vendors, through other forums. They may be
[06:11.320 --> 06:14.600]  available. However you get my seeds, you know where to get them. If you're getting them
[06:14.600 --> 06:17.560]  now, you'll be able to find those seeds there, but that will be a while. We've got to test
[06:17.560 --> 06:19.960]  them. We got to run them and make sure they're worth the crap. I don't want to take your
[06:19.960 --> 06:23.560]  money until I've tested these and make sure that they're quality, quality seeds. That's
[06:23.560 --> 06:28.040]  part of my job as a breeder to verify what I've got. I don't want to give you some, some
[06:28.040 --> 06:31.800]  junk that you're not going to be completely happy with. I want to set you up for success
[06:31.800 --> 06:36.560]  as much as I set myself up for success. So that's kind of an update. Where was I with
[06:36.560 --> 06:40.200]  the update? I didn't even give you an update. I've been breeding. I pollinated all those
[06:40.200 --> 06:43.720]  plants. Guess what? They've been harvested. They're chopped down. They are drying. The
[06:43.720 --> 06:47.480]  way I do it is I cut the plants down. I let them hang for several days until they are
[06:47.480 --> 06:52.000]  crispy dry. Then I put them in a, like a storage container, like a rubber made container.
[06:52.000 --> 06:55.520]  I put on some rubber gloves and while they're over the container, I just grind them up with
[06:55.520 --> 06:59.120]  my hands like this, just mush, mush, mush, mush, mush. And you can hear the seeds fall
[06:59.120 --> 07:02.800]  out into the container. I pull out all the big sticks. The sticks go in the trash or
[07:02.800 --> 07:07.660]  the Bokashi bin or the compost pile, depending on what we got going on at the time. Then
[07:07.660 --> 07:13.680]  I've got a easy seed, seed sorting machine. Once all that seed rolls to one end and all
[07:13.680 --> 07:17.520]  the material is super dry, I'll run all of that through an easy seed sorting machine.
[07:17.520 --> 07:22.160]  It will pull all the chaff from the seed. I've got one pile of seeds, one pile of wasteful
[07:22.160 --> 07:27.120]  material. That'll go probably in a compost bin or in a Bokashi bucket. Sometimes it goes
[07:27.120 --> 07:30.920]  right in the trash to be quite honest with you, but try to be less wasteful. Do what
[07:30.920 --> 07:35.320]  I can with that stuff. That'll get sorted out. That will happen here. Hopefully over
[07:35.320 --> 07:38.520]  the next few days, I've been tied up with a couple of other projects. I got a lot of
[07:38.520 --> 07:41.720]  good things going on. I'm not complaining. I've been doing a couple of other things.
[07:41.720 --> 07:46.580]  Once I get caught up, we'll get those seeds all sorted. My update is that they're harvested.
[07:46.580 --> 07:50.020]  There aren't as many seeds in some as I hoped for. There are way more seeds than I anticipated
[07:50.020 --> 07:54.260]  in some of them. I will get them out to some testers and we will get some reports back
[07:54.260 --> 07:58.400]  to you as soon as possible. I need to germinate some. I like to be ahead of the testers. I
[07:58.400 --> 08:02.780]  don't want my testers flowering before me. I want to get ahead. I want to get some germ
[08:02.780 --> 08:06.800]  time going, some veg time going. Once I'm into flower, then I'll probably send some
[08:06.800 --> 08:10.240]  out to some other people, let them run them, see what they've got. That is the update on
[08:10.240 --> 08:13.460]  the Jack the Rippers. Everyone's going to ask what happened to the JTR. You quit talking
[08:13.460 --> 08:18.680]  about it. I quit talking about it because every time I mention it, I get a hundred emails
[08:18.680 --> 08:23.520]  asking if people can test those Jack the Rippers. Not yet coming soon. You guys let me grow
[08:23.520 --> 08:26.960]  them. Let me play with them first. Once I get them packaged up, sorted, cleaned up all
[08:26.960 --> 08:32.360]  that good stuff, then I will offer some testers. The best way to be a tester, some criteria
[08:32.360 --> 08:36.240]  I will look for is I want to see your social media photography. What are you posting on
[08:36.240 --> 08:41.080]  social media? What kind of grow do you have? What kind of photos do you take? A lot of
[08:41.080 --> 08:45.440]  times when I'm having people grow testers, your photos become the photos that land on
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.400]  the website because I need a good quality photo. Sometimes you guys find a better phenotype
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.000]  than I do. That's not uncommon. Sometimes you guys find gems. Sometimes you get a really
[08:53.000 --> 08:57.080]  solid photo. I love that. Keep doing that shit. But I need someone that can take good
[08:57.080 --> 09:02.240]  photos that can take reliable notes, that can communicate well. People that don't disappear.
[09:02.240 --> 09:05.440]  A lot of people say, I want to be a tester and you send them seeds and guess what? They
[09:05.440 --> 09:09.560]  were not testers. They were fucking a charitable cause. They got a set of free seeds out of
[09:09.560 --> 09:14.240]  me and they never talked to me, contacted me again. They're out there growing fire,
[09:14.240 --> 09:17.800]  probably renamed it, made their own strain out of it, made seeds out of it. Who knows
[09:17.800 --> 09:21.080]  what could happen at that point? But I need people that are cool, not dicks, people that
[09:21.080 --> 09:25.080]  I can rely on, people that will communicate with me. So a good way to up your chances
[09:25.080 --> 09:29.880]  are to be on Cannabuzz and or Instagram. Cannabuzz is a big bonus. I'm trying to build a large
[09:29.880 --> 09:33.080]  community on Cannabuzz because they're not going to boot me. Instagram could boot me
[09:33.080 --> 09:37.280]  at any moment. Cannabuzz, I know the owners and creators of Cannabuzz. I've contributed
[09:37.280 --> 09:42.960]  financially. I'm not afraid to say that I've contributed financially to Cannabuzz's wellbeing.
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.880]  They continue to operate because I helped them out. They helped me out. So join Cannabuzz,
[09:46.880 --> 09:51.880]  please. That'd be pretty fucking cool. Then also, if you're on Patreon, that does also
[09:51.880 --> 09:56.680]  help you out, of course, to be a tester, just to show that you're on the team and you're
[09:56.680 --> 09:59.380]  supportive. Also, that way I've got a way to communicate with you. You're not going
[09:59.380 --> 10:02.940]  to disappear if you're on Patreon. That means you're for real. A lot of people, they'll
[10:02.940 --> 10:06.980]  get seeds, like I said, and they never talk to me again. That's insulting, hurts my feelings.
[10:06.980 --> 10:11.220]  I had a goal. You got limited seeds and now you're gone. That sucks. Patreon people are
[10:11.220 --> 10:14.660]  supporters. They're part of the team. I don't mind sending you guys some rare gems that
[10:14.660 --> 10:18.420]  I know will benefit both of us. All right, I'm fucking rambling. That is the Jack the
[10:18.420 --> 10:21.780]  Ripper update. Big shout out to the hell of tight live batter for getting me talkative
[10:21.780 --> 10:26.500]  today. It is working. I said at the top of the show that I was going to read some messages,
[10:26.500 --> 10:30.980]  some Patreon messages and some emails. Let's not waste too much time. Might be too late
[10:30.980 --> 10:36.700]  for that already. Let's jump right into it. The first email in today's episode goes just
[10:36.700 --> 10:40.500]  like this. It says, hey, Ross to Jeff. I just listened to your grow cast. Oh, they heard
[10:40.500 --> 10:44.300]  me on the grow cast. Several weeks ago, I was on a podcast called the grow cast. Big
[10:44.300 --> 10:47.820]  shout out to Jordan. Thank you for having me on the show. I'm going to get you on my
[10:47.820 --> 10:52.820]  show eventually. But they found me on the grow cast and said, I love what you're doing.
[10:52.820 --> 10:58.500]  I have one question. I want to be a cultivator. Do you have any books that I can get to learn
[10:58.500 --> 11:03.980]  how to start or anything that can help me? I love this question. Too many people, they
[11:03.980 --> 11:08.900]  buy seeds and soil and lights and they put that shit together and then they have a problem
[11:08.900 --> 11:12.620]  four weeks later and they go, I don't have any idea what I'm doing. And they want me
[11:12.620 --> 11:17.180]  to solve their problems and they're in way too deep at this point. I love that this person
[11:17.180 --> 11:21.060]  who did not sign their name, I don't know what they want me to call them. This listener
[11:21.100 --> 11:26.500]  who says thank you. They want books. They want guidance on books to read before they
[11:26.500 --> 11:31.140]  get all of their stuff before they find a problem. I love that. I respect that and appreciate
[11:31.140 --> 11:35.420]  this a lot. Hey, you guys be more like this. Most of you listening probably are, but there
[11:35.420 --> 11:39.260]  are so many people out there. Social media drives me crazy. I kind of need to check out
[11:39.260 --> 11:44.420]  a social media because I see so many terrible questions and there aren't bad questions.
[11:44.420 --> 11:48.300]  Just things you should have read like day one shit and you're on day like 37 and you
[11:48.300 --> 11:52.500]  already have a problem you didn't even know about. Let me get focused. Here are some of
[11:52.500 --> 11:59.460]  the books that I will recommend. I will recommend any books by an author named Greg Green. Greg
[11:59.460 --> 12:05.740]  Green is an amazing cannabis author. Also everything by Robert Connell Clark. Robert
[12:05.740 --> 12:10.340]  Connell Clark will go deep into a cannabis and cultivation education. You will learn
[12:10.340 --> 12:15.360]  a lot. You may have to read these books a couple of times. Don't be shy. Read a chapter,
[12:15.360 --> 12:19.880]  go back, read that chapter again, read another chapter, go back and read them both again.
[12:19.880 --> 12:23.760]  You're not in a hurry to read these books. It's not a rush. Get this knowledge in your
[12:23.760 --> 12:28.520]  brain, learn it, have a good foundation, then move on. And as you're reading, some stuff
[12:28.520 --> 12:32.360]  may not make sense, but a couple chapters later, you're going to go, oh, wait, I just
[12:32.360 --> 12:36.880]  saw the magic trick and it all will kind of unveil itself and it will make sense. So read
[12:36.880 --> 12:41.120]  the Robert Connell Clark books. They're intense. They're in depth. It's a lot to read, but
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.800]  you're going to learn so much from there. Then I also recommend Jorge Cervantes books.
[12:45.800 --> 12:51.000]  People are going to go, oh, he said Jorge. Jorge is an older grower. A lot of what he
[12:51.000 --> 12:58.960]  says will be timely, no, outdated, maybe the word that I'm avoiding, but a lot of his technology
[12:58.960 --> 13:04.560]  is old. A lot of it is from back in the day. Also that shit works. It's a very good foundation.
[13:04.560 --> 13:08.280]  It doesn't cost a lot of money to grow with Jorge Cervantes methods. It doesn't take a
[13:08.280 --> 13:13.440]  lot of science and technology to run his methods and the shit works. So that is a good
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.520]  resource. Jorge Cervantes is a very good place to start when it comes with cannabis books.
[13:18.520 --> 13:22.400]  Also another guy that is very popular in the authoring space when it comes to cannabis
[13:22.400 --> 13:26.760]  is Ed Rosenthal. Many people are going to turn their noses up to the fact that I said
[13:26.760 --> 13:31.880]  Ed Rosenthal, because again, his stuff is a little outdated. He's from back in the day,
[13:31.880 --> 13:37.520]  but he has got a very solid foundation for cannabis education. I haven't read a Jorge
[13:37.520 --> 13:40.880]  book or an Ed book in a minute. The last books were kind of old school. Maybe they
[13:40.880 --> 13:44.280]  have evolved. Don't let me put them down. I'm just saying those guys are a little bit
[13:44.280 --> 13:49.760]  older. They may not be up with all the modern shit, but the stuff they put out will never
[13:49.760 --> 13:55.540]  stop being relevant and useful. That is good quality info. I will support, I haven't read
[13:55.540 --> 13:58.840]  everything they've said, but I'll support most of what those guys say and it will still
[13:58.840 --> 14:04.320]  be useful in 20 years. So those guys are great books, great authors to read books from. We've
[14:04.320 --> 14:10.120]  got Greg Green, Robert Connell Clark, Clark with an E, Robert Connell Clark, C-L-A-R-K-E
[14:10.120 --> 14:14.720]  if you're looking for the book, Marijuana Botany is an amazing book. Jorge Cervantes'
[14:14.720 --> 14:20.560]  books, The Breeders, The Grow Bible, Ed Rosenthal. Ed Rosenthal put out an Oakster Dam course
[14:20.560 --> 14:25.160]  guide, the book for Oakster Dam. That is a really good book. I enjoy it. I think it is
[14:25.160 --> 14:29.680]  quite useful. It's a very good resource for all growers on all levels. Another book I
[14:29.680 --> 14:35.640]  would recommend is from Drew West, Secrets of the West Coast Masters by Drew West. Kind
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.880]  of a secretive book not a lot of people knew about. That is a good book. I like that. There's
[14:39.880 --> 14:45.880]  a breeder by the name of Soma. Soma is from Jacksonville, Florida if I get my facts right.
[14:45.880 --> 14:51.040]  But eventually Soma ended up in Amsterdam. Soma is a very well-known breeder, well-known
[14:51.040 --> 14:54.480]  grower. It's been part of the cannabis industry for a long time. It was a big part of all
[14:54.480 --> 14:59.220]  the high times cannabis cups. Soma has written a book that I enjoy. When you start reading
[14:59.260 --> 15:03.660]  about Soma and you know who Soma is, you'll see my connection to Soma. He's a dreadlocked
[15:03.660 --> 15:10.360]  white guy. He's into the same sort of vibes as me. Big shout out to Soma. I like his stuff.
[15:10.360 --> 15:13.420]  Another book that you might want to read, I'm writing it down, another one because I
[15:13.420 --> 15:18.380]  forgot one. Another author you need a book from is DJ Short. DJ Short put out a small
[15:18.380 --> 15:23.620]  book. Him and Soma both put out very small, very short grow books. They didn't put all
[15:23.620 --> 15:28.540]  the details in there that Jorge and Ed put in there, but they put their little tricks.
[15:28.540 --> 15:32.100]  These little tricks that each grower develops along the way is how a grower will develop
[15:32.100 --> 15:37.060]  their own style, their own niche. If you think about bands, they're all playing drums, bass,
[15:37.060 --> 15:39.660]  guitar, maybe some keyboards. They're all doing the same shit. They're all counting
[15:39.660 --> 15:43.700]  to four playing chords. But just the little things that they've picked up along the way
[15:43.700 --> 15:47.460]  are what makes a band different, where they're from, what they did, what they saw. That's
[15:47.460 --> 15:52.820]  going to affect you as a grower. I think that the book by Soma and DJ Short are very niche
[15:52.820 --> 15:58.220]  books by growers with very established reputations, very established spots in the community. You
[15:58.220 --> 16:01.860]  can learn a lot from them. They didn't need to make a big thick book. Just their thick
[16:01.860 --> 16:07.580]  book with a couple of very cool tricks in it will suffice from them. Soma and DJ Short
[16:07.580 --> 16:11.540]  are the next two I'll recommend. Then there's a guy known as The Rev. The Rev has written
[16:11.540 --> 16:16.700]  a lot of books. Check out the books by The Rev. I think The Rev, I should check my sources.
[16:16.700 --> 16:21.860]  I'm pretty sure The Rev wrote Teeming with Microbes and True Living Organics. We're going
[16:21.860 --> 16:27.380]  to make sure that that's correct. True Living, not Loving. That's a different book. That's
[16:27.380 --> 16:31.380]  a totally different book. Organics. We're going to make sure that we get the right
[16:31.380 --> 16:39.620]  author on this. That's another book that you need either way. True Living Organics. I can
[16:39.620 --> 16:42.780]  buy it on Amazon, but it doesn't tell me who it's by yet. Got to keep clicking, guys. We're
[16:42.780 --> 16:47.020]  going to get there. Just bear with me. It's by The Rev. I'm fucking right. All right.
[16:47.020 --> 16:51.300]  The True Living Organics book by The Rev is a great book. There's a Teeming with Microbes,
[16:51.300 --> 16:55.340]  Teeming with Nutrients, and Teeming with Another Thing series that I really think are great
[16:55.340 --> 17:02.220]  books as well. Check those out. Another author that I would be failing you and myself if
[17:02.220 --> 17:06.900]  I did not mention was Mel Frank. Check out books by Mel Frank. Mel Frank writes great
[17:06.900 --> 17:12.300]  cannabis books and does great cannabis photography. Somebody else I should mention, there's a
[17:12.300 --> 17:17.020]  book called Three Alight. Three Alight will teach you a lot of stuff. It's controversial.
[17:17.020 --> 17:21.260]  They do a lot of crazy shit, but if you grow three pounds of light, I think you're winning.
[17:21.260 --> 17:26.620]  Check out that book. Then I think Let's Grow a Pound is the last book I'm going to mention.
[17:26.620 --> 17:29.940]  It's called Let's Grow a Pound. Who doesn't want to grow a pound of weed? Let's grow a
[17:29.940 --> 17:34.660]  pound. Those are several books that I would recommend. Then we can mention a few more
[17:34.660 --> 17:38.020]  other things that will help you out. I'm writing more notes as we go because I'm having more
[17:38.020 --> 17:43.220]  ideas as this goes along. Those are several books. I'll mention the authors again to recap.
[17:43.220 --> 17:49.980]  Greg Green, Robert O'Connell Clark, Jorge Cervantes, Ed Rosenthal, Drew West, Soma,
[17:49.980 --> 17:55.540]  DJ Short, The Rev. Where are we? Mel Frank. Those are the only authors I wrote down. Those
[17:55.540 --> 18:00.860]  are plenty for you to research and find resources from. Many of those are available on Amazon.
[18:00.860 --> 18:07.140]  Also, many of them are available for free as PDFs on the internet. If you type in PDF
[18:07.140 --> 18:13.420]  Jorge Cervantes Grow Bible, it will come up. PDF Ed Rosenthal, what's it called? Oakster
[18:13.420 --> 18:18.820]  Damn Course Guide, it will come up. Soma Grow Book, PDF, it'll come up. Search for
[18:18.820 --> 18:24.140]  it. All right. Those are great books. Another thing I recommend, and you're listening to
[18:24.140 --> 18:28.800]  my show so you know that this is an option, I recommend podcasts. You can't read a book
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.900]  while you're driving. Maybe you can, but I've seen terrible shit happen from that. Don't
[18:33.900 --> 18:37.380]  read a book while you're driving. You can't read a book while you're in the cubicle at
[18:37.380 --> 18:41.540]  work. You can't undercover read a book with an earbud in your ear. You can listen to podcasts
[18:41.580 --> 18:46.140]  all the time. Also, some of that info will just stick in your head. You won't even realize
[18:46.140 --> 18:50.620]  it's sticking and you didn't have to read it. I recommend podcasts. There are a lot
[18:50.620 --> 18:56.060]  of great cannabis podcasts available. Of course, this show. Listen to this show and tell your
[18:56.060 --> 19:02.100]  friends about this show, please. After that, check out the Embracing Organics show. There's
[19:02.100 --> 19:07.260]  a show called Embracing Organics. It's all about organic growing. My buddy Dirtman Dan
[19:07.260 --> 19:13.020]  and Stabby and Tenasi and Fumidor and several other kick-ass dudes go on Embracing Organics.
[19:13.020 --> 19:18.420]  The show is live every Thursday. It's at 7 p.m. Mountain Time, but it stays up on YouTube,
[19:18.420 --> 19:23.060]  so you can go watch all the old episodes. On Embracing Organics, we talk a lot about
[19:23.060 --> 19:26.940]  cannabis. We talk a lot about random chaotic shit as well, but we will teach you a lot
[19:26.940 --> 19:33.340]  about cannabis. Also, I do a Monday live show on Instagram. Every Monday around 7, 10 Mountain
[19:33.340 --> 19:38.100]  Time, I do a live show where I talk about cannabis. I answer random cannabis questions.
[19:38.100 --> 19:43.300]  Check me out there. You may learn a little bit more. Also, I recommend the Dude Grows
[19:43.300 --> 19:50.040]  podcast. The DGC, the Dude Grows crew, the Dude Grows show is a great, it's an endless
[19:50.040 --> 19:54.600]  resource for cannabis growers. They've got a team of six people doing a podcast. They've
[19:54.600 --> 19:59.100]  got a research guy. They've got a cool, the whole crew chimes in, the Dude Grows crew,
[19:59.100 --> 20:03.060]  the people watching, the audience, join the forum and give advice to the grow questions
[20:03.060 --> 20:07.080]  and help people out. That is a great service. Check out the Dude Grows show. Wherever you're
[20:07.080 --> 20:12.640]  watching my show, you can find the Dude Grows show. Also, I recommend Cannabis Cultivation
[20:12.640 --> 20:18.260]  and Sciences with Tad Hussey. Tad Hussey does an amazing cannabis podcast. Also, check out
[20:18.260 --> 20:24.540]  the Growcast and also check out the podcast. I know podcasting, sometimes you may not want
[20:24.540 --> 20:29.180]  to listen. Some people don't learn that way. Some people do. These are great options. There's
[20:29.180 --> 20:34.060]  also another good show out there by a guy named Kyle Cushman. Kyle Cushman speaks very
[20:34.060 --> 20:37.540]  clearly. He's got a lot of great cannabis knowledge and he's got a podcast. So check
[20:37.540 --> 20:43.180]  him out. And I think Danny Danko may have re-sparked the old Free Weed podcast with
[20:43.180 --> 20:47.360]  a new name. I would have to look and find the new name of it. It is, I know it. It's
[20:47.360 --> 20:51.240]  in my phone. I just can't think of the name of it right now. I remembered it until we
[20:51.240 --> 20:53.940]  got here and it was time to record. So I'm just going to scroll through. It's called
[20:53.940 --> 20:57.940]  Grow Bud Yourself. I'm pretty sure that's Danny Danko's new show. So check out Grow
[20:57.940 --> 21:02.860]  Bud Yourself. I'm going to make sure that that's Danny Danko's show. Let's see. It doesn't
[21:02.860 --> 21:07.860]  say. It's got to be Danny Danko in there just by the names that I'm seeing on this. All
[21:07.860 --> 21:11.980]  right. I'm going to claim that's Danny Danko. If not, correct me. There's a corrections
[21:11.980 --> 21:17.060]  department. The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. We'd love to hear from you. So check out. That's
[21:17.060 --> 21:22.040]  a lot of books. That's a lot of podcasts. Now there's another guy who I would be rude
[21:22.040 --> 21:27.500]  if I didn't mention. I think that this guy is a, you guys think I'm some sort of cannabis
[21:27.500 --> 21:33.660]  Yoda? This is my ganja Yoda. Listen to a man by the name of Kevin Jodrey. He spells
[21:33.660 --> 21:41.380]  his name J-O-D-R-E-Y. Kevin Jodrey. He's part of the regenerative, that was, excuse me,
[21:41.380 --> 21:47.620]  the regenerative cannabis project. He does a lot of talking about cannabis and breeding
[21:47.620 --> 21:52.780]  and sustainability and anything you want to know about cannabis. Kevin Jodrey has probably
[21:52.780 --> 21:59.180]  spoken about it or he will very soon. Kevin Jodrey is fucking cannabis Yoda in my opinion.
[21:59.180 --> 22:03.340]  So check out Kevin Jodrey. A lot of great stuff. You'll learn a lot from him. All right.
[22:03.340 --> 22:07.180]  I feel like there are more resources I could give you, but I've been rambling about that
[22:07.180 --> 22:10.300]  one and I forgot the other ones that were on the top of my head. So make sure you check
[22:10.300 --> 22:14.400]  out all of those resources and I hope you learn a bunch. And also I'm proud of you for
[22:14.400 --> 22:18.220]  wanting to read more books. That is really cool. Too many people jump in, they dive in
[22:18.220 --> 22:22.380]  head first and smash their head on a rock. They were not prepared. All right. I'm going
[22:22.380 --> 22:25.380]  to keep moving forward. I do have a couple of more messages and I don't want to run out
[22:25.380 --> 22:31.500]  of time. The next message comes from Jer Bear and it goes like this. It says, yo Rasta Jeff,
[22:31.500 --> 22:35.060]  we were building out our grow still and it's coming along great. I love to hear that. I
[22:35.060 --> 22:40.220]  wish you great success in your grow. Says slowly but surely. That is how it goes, bro.
[22:40.220 --> 22:43.900]  Contractors take their time. The more you tell them to hurry, the longer they're going
[22:43.900 --> 22:47.060]  to take. And then all the inspectors are going to take even longer and then licensing is
[22:47.060 --> 22:51.180]  going to take even longer. Don't worry. It'll get going. There is more to this that we don't
[22:51.180 --> 22:54.180]  need to talk about. We're going to get to the point of the show. It says, Hey man, I've
[22:54.180 --> 22:57.980]  been digging the grow from your heart podcast. I wanted to keep in touch because I like your
[22:57.980 --> 23:02.060]  suggestions, your selections. Thank you. I appreciate that. They like the show and the
[23:02.060 --> 23:07.180]  genetics. I'm loving learning more about your genetics and breeding. Thank you. I've come
[23:07.180 --> 23:11.380]  to appreciate all of the work you do. Thank you for the constant feed of knowledge. You
[23:11.380 --> 23:15.220]  are very welcome. Thank you for supporting all the stuff I do. Here's the fun part. It
[23:15.220 --> 23:20.760]  says my wife has even come to like your show minus all the cussing. I apologize for the
[23:20.760 --> 23:26.040]  minor cussing. I am, uh, I'm myself on the show before I thought about making a cuss jar
[23:26.240 --> 23:30.520]  or a swear jar. I did make a contribution to somebody every time for a certain amount
[23:30.520 --> 23:34.520]  of episodes. If every time I said a cuss word, I had to put a $5 bill in the jar that did
[23:34.520 --> 23:38.320]  happen. Uh, we gave that away. And then I went back to saying, fuck it and being myself.
[23:38.320 --> 23:42.760]  Cause sometimes, uh, fuck is the best word for the situation. I'm sorry that some people
[23:42.760 --> 23:46.640]  don't like that, but it's better to be me than try to censor myself. It works better.
[23:47.120 --> 23:50.200]  It does go on though. And I'm sorry to your wife for all the profanity. I'm sorry. I know
[23:50.200 --> 23:53.520]  sometimes the ladies aren't way into that. Uh, but I'm glad she's come around and she
[23:53.520 --> 23:57.160]  enjoys the show. Even though I do use some course language, I'm a pretty good dude most
[23:57.160 --> 24:00.880]  of the time. So thank you. Big shout out to the wife. Uh, keep my grower friend, keep
[24:00.880 --> 24:04.400]  Jerry bear strong. It's all about the good wives, keeping us good men strong. So, uh,
[24:04.440 --> 24:08.440]  take good care of this dude here for us. Let's keep moving. It says, I do have a question
[24:08.440 --> 24:12.280]  for you. Maybe you could use it for the podcast. We got this far. I better use it on the
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.120]  show. It says, what keeps you motivated every day in the industry? How do you keep the
[24:17.120 --> 24:23.200]  positive vibe going? What seems like every day from your friend, Jerry bear and his wife?
[24:23.480 --> 24:27.520]  Uh, that's a great question. Thank you, Jerry bear and miss Jerry bear at, uh, it's a
[24:27.520 --> 24:31.640]  beautiful question because I do work every day in the cannabis industry, whether it's in a
[24:31.640 --> 24:35.600]  warehouse, which hasn't been as much lately, uh, which is kind of nice. Uh, the COVID
[24:35.600 --> 24:39.400]  stuff slowed down all of that. I haven't had to go out of town to go to a commercial grow
[24:39.400 --> 24:43.120]  and suit up and all the weird grow gear. And that's been kind of nice taking a little break
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.880]  doing that. But I am in the cannabis industry every day. I'm dealing with either a podcast,
[24:47.880 --> 24:54.320]  my own grow, a seed sale, a breeding project, a deal somewhere, a question. Uh, I do, uh,
[24:54.360 --> 24:58.400]  phone conversations. What are they called? Phone consultations all the time. I do work
[24:58.400 --> 25:03.080]  in the industry every single day. And you're right. Any industry that you're in, I was
[25:03.080 --> 25:06.440]  in the music industry. And when I quit the music industry, I was like, Oh, that was a
[25:06.440 --> 25:09.480]  bunch of bullshit. I'm so glad that's over. So everything you do is going to be
[25:09.480 --> 25:13.600]  stressful. It's going to have some sort of a challenge. It's all about how you see that
[25:13.600 --> 25:17.040]  challenge, how you accept that challenge, how you embrace that challenge, how you take
[25:17.040 --> 25:23.600]  that struggle. Uh, how do I stay motivated every day? I love what I do. I could be, I
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.440]  don't want to disrespect anybody else's job, but I don't want to do it. I could be flipping
[25:27.440 --> 25:31.800]  burgers. That would not work for me. I could be working in it. That would not work for
[25:31.800 --> 25:35.640]  me. I could be in the military. That would fucking not work for me. I love all you guys
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.280]  that do that. I'm just saying that's not for me. And I am blessed and grateful. And
[25:41.280 --> 25:44.600]  I acknowledge the fact that I'm not doing those things that I'm doing what I want to
[25:44.600 --> 25:48.160]  do. I want to grow cannabis. I want to do a podcast. I want to talk to my friends on
[25:48.160 --> 25:51.440]  social media. I want to talk to people and help them improve their gardens and their
[25:51.440 --> 25:55.520]  lives. I want to do consultations and make big grows that were making a little bit of
[25:55.520 --> 26:00.040]  profit, make a lot of profit so they can give everybody in the center a bonus and the patients
[26:00.040 --> 26:03.920]  can get a better quality product. I'm doing what I want to do every day, all day long.
[26:03.920 --> 26:09.280]  So I'm spoiled. And part of that keeps me motivated knowing that if I don't do this,
[26:09.280 --> 26:12.400]  I could be doing that. And I don't want to do that. No. And again, no offense to you
[26:12.400 --> 26:16.080]  guys doing your thing out there. I understand some people are fucking struggling. Like I
[26:16.080 --> 26:20.800]  said, I am blessed and I acknowledge that I know that I've got a very good thing going.
[26:20.800 --> 26:27.280]  So that part keeps me motivated. Then I got this knowledge. I got this knowledge by studying,
[26:27.280 --> 26:33.200]  reading, learning, absorbing, practicing, repeat. But my name is Rasta Jeff. So you
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.440]  know what I believe in. I believe in Jah. I think that if I didn't use this knowledge,
[26:37.440 --> 26:41.840]  also not only the gift of learning cannabis very well, I've got this gift of speaking
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.640]  and providing information, relaying information in a really clear and concise way. And if
[26:46.640 --> 26:52.320]  I didn't utilize both of those, it would be disrespectful to you and to Jah to not put
[26:52.320 --> 26:56.560]  this gift back out. I'm blessed. I'm given a lot of things. This is my return contribution.
[26:56.560 --> 27:02.520]  There are a lot of things I do, but this is one of my give backs. This is like my karma.
[27:02.520 --> 27:07.000]  Without this, I would blow up. If I didn't do this show, if I didn't grow cannabis, if I didn't
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.960]  play the drums once or twice a week, I don't know if it's spontaneously combust. I don't know if
[27:11.960 --> 27:18.120]  it'd be an explosion, an eruption. Things wouldn't be well. So this podcast is what, it's a lot of
[27:18.120 --> 27:25.240]  my life. This industry is a lot of my life. Seeing plants that look yellow and shitty turn into a
[27:25.240 --> 27:30.200]  successful harvest is part of what keeps me motivated. Turning shit around. I wrote notes
[27:30.200 --> 27:34.360]  and I haven't even needed to use them. New questions keep me motivated. Every day there's
[27:34.360 --> 27:40.280]  a new question. Every day there's a new challenge. Also every day there's new technology. I was
[27:40.280 --> 27:43.880]  telling somebody the other day, I haven't been in a commercial grow in so long. It hasn't been
[27:43.880 --> 27:47.720]  that long. It's been basically a little bit into quarantine, but I was like, I haven't been in a
[27:47.720 --> 27:53.000]  commercial grow that I feel like it's all changed because it changes so rapidly. Like every other
[27:53.000 --> 27:56.520]  day we're like, oh, have you seen this? We should put one of these in the grow, put this in room B
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.040]  and see what happens. Or let's put this in the small room and see if it makes a difference. We're
[28:00.040 --> 28:04.520]  always looking at new toys, new gear, and then we buy it and we put it in there and we take notes.
[28:04.520 --> 28:08.840]  We document that shit, watch it on camera, watch it on the monitor units. I haven't been able to
[28:08.840 --> 28:12.920]  do that. I feel like all the technology has surpassed me in the past three, four months.
[28:12.920 --> 28:17.240]  I don't know what's out there anymore, but I'm paying attention by contacting and communicating
[28:17.240 --> 28:21.080]  with my friends. I watch online. All you guys love to post your fucking grows online. So I see
[28:21.080 --> 28:25.320]  what's going on in every grow anyway. I've got a really good eye for detail. So there are always
[28:25.320 --> 28:30.840]  new questions. There's always new technology and there are always new states legalizing. So I'm
[28:30.840 --> 28:36.040]  getting a whole new audience and batch of people that need help all the time. There are new growers
[28:36.040 --> 28:40.360]  that are calling me up, emailing me, finding the show, sending me Twitter messages, reaching out
[28:40.360 --> 28:46.360]  on Instagram, constant influx of new people that need help. And all that motivation from new people
[28:46.360 --> 28:51.160]  keeps me going. I get to help 30 people a day fix their garden. People that were going to have a
[28:51.240 --> 28:56.040]  failure get to have a harvest. And I don't know, just seeing that improvement, seeing a rescue
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.160]  just feels good. That's motivating. There are new struggles every day. There are always new
[29:01.160 --> 29:05.480]  struggles in this industry. I don't feel like I've learned everything yet. And I kind of like,
[29:06.360 --> 29:10.760]  it's like when you go into, I use karate as an analogy a lot. If you go into an MMA fight,
[29:10.760 --> 29:13.880]  both of you are trained, you know how to do this, you know what to expect,
[29:14.440 --> 29:17.400]  but there's going to be a couple of moments in here. We don't know what the fuck is going on.
[29:17.400 --> 29:22.440]  And we get to figure it out on the fly. Now that I'm comfortable, fucking swinging, kicking,
[29:22.440 --> 29:26.120]  blocking, taking you down, putting that choke hold on, defending another choke hold,
[29:26.120 --> 29:30.760]  wrapping around, getting that Kimura going. Now, when you start to throw on that rear naked choke,
[29:30.760 --> 29:35.240]  I know what to do. I could shake out of that rear naked choke. I could fucking get back up on top.
[29:35.240 --> 29:39.080]  I could get the fucking mount. I could ground and pound at that point. So if you throw some
[29:39.080 --> 29:43.480]  weird questions at me, it's not hard anymore. I know what I'm doing, but I like the challenge
[29:43.480 --> 29:46.840]  of answering the question kind of on the fly. That's why I do that Monday live show. That
[29:46.840 --> 29:51.240]  keeps me sharp. There's no editing, no censoring. I try to answer every question that comes in.
[29:51.240 --> 29:55.080]  It comes in. They're like, what's nine times nine? I'm like 81. They're like, what's A plus B? And
[29:55.080 --> 30:00.120]  I'm like B plus A bitch. And I got to answer them as quick as I can. So those challenges keep me
[30:00.120 --> 30:04.920]  motivated. I like it. I can't remember who said it now, but I got so many quotes in my head. I'm
[30:04.920 --> 30:09.080]  forgetting the author. Was it Einstein or Edison that said, I don't think I'm a genius. I'm just
[30:09.080 --> 30:13.320]  passionately curious. It was fucking Einstein. Who knows Einstein? Yeah. Who said that?
[30:13.320 --> 30:18.440]  Passionately curious. That's me. I want to know everything about this plant inside and out so that
[30:18.440 --> 30:23.400]  I can make you guys able to grow this plant beautifully and perfectly. If I don't understand
[30:23.400 --> 30:28.600]  completely, I can't teach you. So the rewards are a lot of what keeps me motivated. Of course,
[30:28.600 --> 30:32.920]  there's a financial reward. I get Patreon contributions for the show. Sponsors pay me.
[30:32.920 --> 30:38.920]  I get a paycheck for doing consulting. I get paid for selling seeds. But on top of that,
[30:38.920 --> 30:44.840]  the inbox messages that say, Hey, Ross and Jeff, my plants were failing. And you spent five minutes
[30:44.840 --> 30:49.240]  on a podcast saying, do this, do this and do that. And now my plants look amazing. That is
[30:49.960 --> 30:54.920]  equally as rewarding as a PayPal financial contribution. Don't stop with the PayPal and
[30:54.920 --> 30:59.720]  don't stop with the compliments either. But they feel equally as well. They're both like a big
[30:59.720 --> 31:05.720]  high five, a pat on the back. Then people saying, I've got cancer. And I felt like shit. And you
[31:05.720 --> 31:10.200]  taught me how to grow weed. And I smoke weed. And I forgot that I have cancer, bro. Think about
[31:10.200 --> 31:14.760]  how that would make you feel inside. That is awesome. So I get to get filled up with that
[31:14.760 --> 31:19.560]  positive energy from those sort of stories all the time. And then I get to see it in real life,
[31:19.560 --> 31:24.200]  not just through messages, I get to see that shit. So that's a lot of what keeps me motivated.
[31:24.200 --> 31:28.440]  That is a big part of what keeps me motivated. Seeing the outcome, tangible outcomes keep me
[31:28.440 --> 31:33.240]  motivated. When you're accomplishing goals. You want to get more goals when you when you can do
[31:33.320 --> 31:36.920]  two things in a day, you want to do three. And then when you get three, you want to do five.
[31:36.920 --> 31:40.280]  And there's something about doing five that makes you want to do 10. And when you do 10,
[31:40.280 --> 31:44.440]  you don't want 11, you want 20. And when you got 20, you want 25 or 30. And when you get 30,
[31:44.440 --> 31:49.160]  you want 50 and 50 makes you want 100. And that's, that's just not money. I'm not just saying
[31:49.160 --> 31:53.800]  financially, I'm saying crushing goals. I'm saying collecting anything when you get that snowball
[31:53.800 --> 31:58.280]  going, it's exponentially. And I like accomplishing goals. I know how much I can get done in a day.
[31:58.280 --> 32:03.160]  And it's fucking tremendous. So answering those many questions, seeing the tangible progress,
[32:03.160 --> 32:08.760]  that is what keeps me motivated. I want to thank you for the great message, Jer Bear. Thank you for
[32:08.760 --> 32:11.800]  listening to the show. Sorry about all the stuttering. I'm excited. I want to give your
[32:11.800 --> 32:16.040]  wife a big shout out for coming around to the show. And I do apologize for my filthy mouth.
[32:16.040 --> 32:20.920]  I'll try to behave myself, ma'am. Thank you for listening. All right, let's move into the next
[32:20.920 --> 32:24.040]  message. This will be the last email for the show because I've been going for a lot longer
[32:24.120 --> 32:28.360]  on these emails than anticipated. Nothing wrong with that. It's all for love. It's all for the
[32:28.360 --> 32:32.680]  support of the plant. Let's keep going. This one says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, that should be a song.
[32:32.680 --> 32:38.040]  I hear that in the, Hey, Rasta Jeff. All right, somebody do it. It says, Hey, I just want to thank
[32:38.040 --> 32:42.760]  you for such a great podcast material at the perfect price. Hey, wait a minute. The show is
[32:42.760 --> 32:46.520]  free. You saying the show ain't worth nothing? Then they just said, I'm just kidding. You work
[32:46.520 --> 32:50.840]  your ass off. So thank you. Thank you, bro. I caught the joke. I appreciate it. The show is
[32:50.840 --> 32:55.160]  free. If you feel like contributing, you can patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[32:55.160 --> 33:00.600]  Let's keep going. It says, So can over fertilization cause a plant to harm? Yes, it can.
[33:00.600 --> 33:06.360]  That is the quick answer. And if so, do you stress test your strains to their perming point? That's
[33:06.360 --> 33:13.080]  another great question. Can plants harm from over fertilization? Yes. Things like OG Kush and some
[33:13.080 --> 33:19.400]  chems will absolutely harm by looking at them wrong. You can breathe at it wrong. You can wear
[33:19.480 --> 33:23.640]  the wrong shirt. If your shoes and your shirt don't match, sometimes OG Kush will get mad at
[33:23.640 --> 33:30.280]  you and harm out. That is a thing that Kush genetics do. Overfeed, underfeed, the wrong
[33:30.280 --> 33:35.880]  temperatures, major temperature swings, weird stresses. Those things can cause hermaphroditic
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.240]  traits in plants. Yes. Over fertilization can absolutely cause a plant to harm. It's going,
[33:41.240 --> 33:45.800]  I've been fed so hard that I just don't know what to do. So I'm just going to kind of freak out.
[33:45.800 --> 33:50.600]  And when a plant freaks out, it hermaphrodites, it's trying to become asexual, pollinate itself
[33:50.600 --> 33:55.000]  so that it can reproduce. And even if it's going to die a slow, miserable death, at least it gets
[33:55.000 --> 34:00.680]  to make babies and they get to live and try again. So yes, over fertilization can absolutely cause
[34:00.680 --> 34:06.120]  your plant to harm. The second part is, if so, do you test your strains to their perming point?
[34:07.400 --> 34:12.600]  I've done something better. I know that a lot of stress tests will cause my plants to harm.
[34:12.600 --> 34:17.800]  My favorite stress test is a light stress. I put the lights on for 12-12. We're now in flower for
[34:17.800 --> 34:23.160]  12-12. Eventually I'll fuck that light cycle up and put it on 18-6, then put it back to 12-12.
[34:23.160 --> 34:27.000]  I'll watch and see if the plants do any weird shit. If they don't, they get to keep living.
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.360]  If they do weird shit, guess what? We cut them all down. They go bye-bye. They're not breeding
[34:30.360 --> 34:34.520]  plants. Then I'll put them on 24 hours. Then I'll put them back on 12-12 and we'll keep watching
[34:34.520 --> 34:38.120]  them. If they don't harm out from that, I don't think they're going to harm out from over
[34:38.120 --> 34:44.440]  fertilization. That is how my plants are auditioned for breeding. Once those plants are pollinated,
[34:44.440 --> 34:50.520]  I send my seeds to a lot of people. I know that many of those people are over feeders. I'm not
[34:50.520 --> 34:56.120]  calling anybody out. I've selected people that are amazing growers and scary growers and everywhere
[34:56.120 --> 35:00.440]  in between. I know that my plants are getting grown by fucking champions. I also know that the
[35:00.440 --> 35:05.160]  seeds I made are getting fucking abused like fucking hostages in a fucking cage somewhere,
[35:05.160 --> 35:10.120]  but that's what I need to see. I rely on those abusive growers to tell me that these plants are
[35:10.120 --> 35:14.360]  herms or not. They're the ones going to find the problems. When they don't find herms, they don't
[35:14.360 --> 35:20.600]  find problems. I know that the plants are good for people. I don't over fertilize for stress testing.
[35:20.600 --> 35:26.600]  I do more of a light test. I do more weird shit like that, but the growers, my testers, I am certain
[35:26.600 --> 35:30.920]  that they are over fertilizing. I've seen some crazy shit in test reports. They're the ones doing
[35:30.920 --> 35:38.680]  that for me. It goes on to say, also, since I have learned to clone, seeds seem amazingly cheap.
[35:38.680 --> 35:43.720]  That is my favorite, favorite statement on today's podcast. Yeah, seeds are expensive. You pay a good
[35:43.720 --> 35:47.400]  dollar amount for a package of seeds. Some people have been paying good dollar amounts for some
[35:47.400 --> 35:52.600]  seeds on cannabis and some auctions, and those are rare gems. But if you think about having a rare
[35:52.600 --> 35:57.000]  gem at a high cost, nobody else has got that package of seeds. Once you take clones of it,
[35:57.000 --> 36:02.840]  you've got that plant forever. You don't ever lose it. You keep the clone going. You keep a clone.
[36:02.840 --> 36:07.080]  You keep a clone. You're always going to have that genetic, that cultivar. You can reproduce that
[36:07.080 --> 36:12.440]  outcome over and over again. Your patients or your clientele or your bong will always have that
[36:12.440 --> 36:17.880]  supply of that same medicine. And if it's something amazing, if it came from seed and nobody else has
[36:17.880 --> 36:22.040]  it because it came from a seed and you don't give a clone out, nobody else has it. Now, you've set
[36:22.040 --> 36:27.000]  yourself apart from the market. If you're one of those guys that needs market competition, nobody
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.200]  else has it. You can say, I've got the only strawberry starburst around here. It came from a
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.680]  seed. I got the phenotype that turns purple and smells like watermelons. Nobody else has it. You're
[36:36.680 --> 36:41.080]  the only one with it, what they want it. Guess who's coming to you? Everybody that wants that one.
[36:41.080 --> 36:45.000]  All right. So, yeah, seeds are amazingly cheap. Once you learn how to clone, you can keep that
[36:45.000 --> 36:49.800]  seed around forever. A couple of runs, it will pay for those seeds. Hopefully the first run pays for
[36:49.800 --> 36:54.680]  the seeds on itself, covers the cost of gear and nutrients. That second one is all for the pocket.
[36:54.680 --> 36:59.080]  All right. It says, thanks for all you do. And that's how the news goes. I want to thank you for
[36:59.080 --> 37:04.840]  the great message. I've seen you pop up in the feed a few times. Yeah. So basically, food will
[37:04.840 --> 37:10.360]  cause it to hermaphrodite, temps and stress and light problems. And I think I covered all of that.
[37:10.360 --> 37:13.800]  Yep. All right. You didn't leave your name. So I can't say thank you, but that's how the news goes.
[37:13.800 --> 37:17.480]  Hey, thank you for the great message. I want to thank everybody for the wonderful emails and
