[00:01.720 --> 00:04.680]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:04.680 --> 00:07.880]  It's time for a Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.880 --> 00:11.740]  I like to call these Thursday episodes the Thursday Quickie.
[00:11.740 --> 00:14.940]  These quickies are brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Bank.
[00:14.940 --> 00:17.140]  Make sure you check them out at dankseed.store.
[00:17.140 --> 00:21.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, it won't be a quickie unless we get started right away, so let's
[00:21.820 --> 00:24.480]  get on with the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:24.480 --> 00:30.000]  All right, podcast world, welcome to a Thursday Quickie episode.
[00:30.000 --> 00:31.220]  I'm going to try and keep this quick.
[00:31.220 --> 00:34.620]  I like to start these episodes by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[00:34.620 --> 00:38.980]  Today I am dabbing on some Titan OG from our friends at Apothecary Extracts.
[00:38.980 --> 00:41.500]  I've got the Titan OG batter.
[00:41.500 --> 00:43.980]  It's nice and ... It smells like nice OG.
[00:43.980 --> 00:49.500]  It's a nice battery texture, and I've been dunking this into the Aloha Limone high cannabinoid
[00:49.500 --> 00:52.020]  full spectrum extract crystals.
[00:52.020 --> 00:54.060]  It has been a tremendous combo.
[00:54.060 --> 00:58.300]  It has given me some amazing cotton mouth, so I apologize if I sound all dry mouthed
[00:58.300 --> 01:00.380]  and weird on this episode.
[01:00.540 --> 01:02.620]  We're going to blame it on the amazing dabs.
[01:02.620 --> 01:03.900]  Thanks again for joining me, you guys.
[01:03.900 --> 01:05.860]  I like to keep these episodes quick.
[01:05.860 --> 01:09.020]  I want to read some emails, so let's get right to it.
[01:09.020 --> 01:10.460]  This first email goes like this.
[01:10.460 --> 01:11.460]  Ross to Jeff.
[01:11.460 --> 01:12.460]  Morning, my man.
[01:12.460 --> 01:13.980]  Hope to hear you're doing all right today.
[01:13.980 --> 01:15.580]  Sorry for the delay in emails.
[01:15.580 --> 01:20.220]  My family and myself decided it would be a good idea to all catch the flu at the same
[01:20.220 --> 01:21.220]  time.
[01:21.220 --> 01:22.220]  I regret our decision, LOL.
[01:22.220 --> 01:24.100]  Yeah, that's a bad decision.
[01:24.100 --> 01:26.100]  Whoever made that decision, they're fired.
[01:26.100 --> 01:29.460]  He goes on to say, I wanted to write back and let you know the suggestions you made
[01:29.540 --> 01:30.540]  seem to have worked.
[01:30.540 --> 01:34.180]  I brought my pH up to 6.3 and I'm giving more nutrients.
[01:34.180 --> 01:35.500]  Thank you so much, man.
[01:35.500 --> 01:40.460]  I live in Ohio and I don't have anyone around me who grows, so the little quick weird questions
[01:40.460 --> 01:44.860]  are quickest answered by the experienced guys like yourself.
[01:44.860 --> 01:45.860]  Let me go back a little bit.
[01:45.860 --> 01:49.340]  This guy actually sent us an email recently saying that he was having some problems with
[01:49.340 --> 01:53.740]  his plants and I recommended that he adjust his pH and change his feed a little bit.
[01:53.740 --> 01:56.920]  It looks like I nailed his problems and the plants are looking better.
[01:56.920 --> 01:57.920]  That's great to hear.
[01:57.920 --> 01:58.920]  Thanks for the feedback.
[01:58.920 --> 02:00.800]  Before we get to the update, the email also goes like this.
[02:00.800 --> 02:03.520]  It says, got another question if you have the time good, sir.
[02:03.520 --> 02:06.200]  I'm looking to step into the world of mostly sativas.
[02:06.200 --> 02:12.020]  Do you have a recommendation or maybe a genetic that you would fit that would fit the mold?
[02:12.020 --> 02:15.760]  It would have to be a strain that's a little forgiving since it's my first go at them.
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.220]  I've been growing for a couple of years, but I have limited myself to mostly Indica's because
[02:20.220 --> 02:21.720]  of gross size restrictions.
[02:21.720 --> 02:24.180]  It will be grown in a three by three.
[02:24.180 --> 02:26.920]  My question is how tall is your three by three?
[02:26.920 --> 02:27.920]  How much height do you have?
[02:27.920 --> 02:31.520]  How much ceiling space do you have from the light?
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.720]  But sativas, do you know when you say sativas, do you mean like a crazy sativa, like a 14
[02:36.720 --> 02:38.240]  or 16 week sativa?
[02:38.240 --> 02:41.060]  Or do you just mean like a nine or 10 or maybe an 11 week sativa?
[02:41.060 --> 02:43.020]  There's a couple of factors in there.
[02:43.020 --> 02:47.680]  You can go really long, hazy stuff like a super silver haze or a Neville's haze or something
[02:47.680 --> 02:52.240]  like that if you want to go really long or if you just want nine or 10 weeks, maybe something
[02:52.240 --> 02:56.840]  like super lemon haze isn't as long and very much more sativa dominant.
[02:56.840 --> 03:01.600]  If you want something from my lineup, I would recommend either the storm shadow or the scarlet
[03:01.600 --> 03:05.520]  begonias would be a tall, long flower sativa that would work well for you.
[03:05.520 --> 03:09.160]  But I want to know how tall your space is because you're going to have to thing with
[03:09.160 --> 03:12.200]  this is if you're going to grow from cedar clone, you decide when you're going to flip
[03:12.200 --> 03:16.040]  the flower so you can grow it to be six inches tall and then flower it and it will fit in
[03:16.040 --> 03:17.120]  any space you've got.
[03:17.120 --> 03:18.880]  So it will be able to grow in there.
[03:18.880 --> 03:21.140]  You've just got to plan ahead and know what you've got.
[03:21.140 --> 03:25.760]  So if you want like a 10 weeker, I'd say go with like scarlet begonias or storm shadow.
[03:25.760 --> 03:29.320]  If you're looking for longer, then you're going to want to start looking into something
[03:29.320 --> 03:30.440]  with the word haze in it.
[03:30.440 --> 03:32.800]  The hazes are going to take longer to grow.
[03:32.800 --> 03:36.400]  This would be a really cool option or an opportunity for you to grow from seed.
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.640]  You can get some seeds that are sativa dominant and then you can find the one that grows well
[03:40.640 --> 03:44.360]  for your limited space and you can find the one that takes exactly how long you want it
[03:44.360 --> 03:45.360]  to take.
[03:45.360 --> 03:48.440]  So this is a good opportunity to grow from seed.
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.840]  But a good sativa is going to take you anywhere between 10 and 14, maybe 16 weeks depending
[03:52.840 --> 03:54.760]  on what you decide to get.
[03:54.760 --> 03:55.760]  Don't cut it early.
[03:55.760 --> 03:56.760]  That's going to be my advice.
[03:56.760 --> 03:59.120]  A lot of people like to cut down a sativa too early.
[03:59.120 --> 04:00.120]  Let it finish.
[04:00.120 --> 04:02.000]  It's always better when things finish.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.120]  If you're going to veg for a couple of weeks and then you're going to flower for 10 to
[04:05.120 --> 04:08.360]  14 weeks, why not wait that extra week and let it get all the way done?
[04:08.360 --> 04:10.200]  So don't rush yourself with a sativa.
[04:10.200 --> 04:11.840]  Be patient.
[04:11.840 --> 04:14.840]  Now for strain recommendations, it's hard to know what you're looking for, what your
[04:14.840 --> 04:17.200]  flavor profile is going to be, how you want it to grow.
[04:17.200 --> 04:21.760]  I know you've got that small space, but if you want something that's going to go like
[04:21.760 --> 04:27.080]  10 or 11 weeks, maybe 12 weeks, like 9 or 10 weeks, I'd say look at the storm shadow,
[04:27.080 --> 04:28.080]  maybe 10 weeks.
[04:28.080 --> 04:30.680]  Look at the Scarlet Begonias.
[04:30.680 --> 04:36.380]  If you want to go maybe a little longer, maybe check out Brothers Grimm's Cindy 99 or their
[04:36.380 --> 04:38.120]  new Durban Poison that's coming out.
[04:38.120 --> 04:40.120]  That may take you a little longer, 10, 11 weeks.
[04:40.120 --> 04:43.680]  I've had some Durban Poison seeds take me 14 weeks and I cut them down and they were
[04:43.680 --> 04:47.960]  nowhere near done, but they produced buds that were longer than my arms.
[04:47.960 --> 04:48.960]  And I'm a big dude.
[04:48.960 --> 04:49.960]  I'm a tall guy.
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.920]  I have long monkey arms and those buds were as long as my arms.
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.840]  Also if you want longer flowering stuff, things with the word haze in it are usually going
[04:57.840 --> 05:00.520]  to be sativa heavy that will take a long time.
[05:00.520 --> 05:06.320]  Super Silver Haze, Aryan's Haze, Neville's Haze, a lot of the haze stuff will take a
[05:06.320 --> 05:07.520]  lot longer to finish.
[05:07.520 --> 05:10.880]  The word haze usually indicates long finishing.
[05:10.880 --> 05:11.880]  Look for hazes.
[05:11.880 --> 05:15.800]  I would say go to the Helladank Seed Bank and check out some breeders there and see
[05:15.800 --> 05:18.800]  if anything catches your eye and look at long flowering sativas.
[05:18.800 --> 05:21.160]  That's a good way to do it to see what gets your attention.
[05:21.160 --> 05:26.080]  This is a great opportunity to grow from seed because you'll be able to find the strain
[05:26.080 --> 05:29.760]  you want, then you'll be able to narrow it down to the phenotype you want, and then you'll
[05:29.760 --> 05:34.480]  have the sativa that grows well in your environment and does what you need it to do.
[05:34.480 --> 05:35.480]  So I'm going to keep going.
[05:35.480 --> 05:36.900]  There's more of this email.
[05:36.900 --> 05:38.840]  It says, I grow for medical reasons.
[05:38.840 --> 05:42.160]  I have bipolar, depression, as well as PTSD.
[05:42.160 --> 05:46.520]  I was on many different prescriptions for major depression, anxiety, antipsychotics
[05:46.520 --> 05:48.520]  for sleep, and it straight up sucked.
[05:48.520 --> 05:50.240]  At times, the side effects were horrible.
[05:50.240 --> 05:53.520]  Yeah, that sounds like that could be horrible when you're taking that many prescriptions.
[05:53.520 --> 05:56.920]  I would assume that they would start battling each other eventually, that you're taking
[05:56.920 --> 05:59.640]  one to do this and the other one will do this, and then they're going to mix and do shit
[05:59.640 --> 06:00.640]  you didn't expect.
[06:00.640 --> 06:03.400]  I could only imagine how terrible that was.
[06:03.400 --> 06:07.240]  The email also goes on to say, I did that vicious circle for a few years, then broke
[06:07.240 --> 06:12.320]  down after 29 years of being completely anti-weed, and I tried it.
[06:12.320 --> 06:18.280]  I'm now 31, and after two years, I'm happy to say I'm on zero pills, and I am straight
[06:18.320 --> 06:19.320]  cannabis.
[06:19.320 --> 06:21.560]  You hear that, guys?
[06:21.560 --> 06:27.520]  This guy used to be on, let's see, he's got bipolar, depression, and PTSD.
[06:27.520 --> 06:32.280]  He was on different prescriptions for major anxiety, depression, and antipsychotics for
[06:32.280 --> 06:33.280]  sleep.
[06:33.280 --> 06:34.720]  He was on three different pills that he mentioned here.
[06:34.720 --> 06:38.600]  He doesn't say what they were, but now he's on zero pills and straight cannabis.
[06:38.600 --> 06:40.960]  The next sentence of his email is the most important part.
[06:40.960 --> 06:44.600]  It says, weed saved my life.
[06:44.600 --> 06:51.120]  This person went 29 years without consuming cannabis and was having major mental health
[06:51.120 --> 06:54.240]  concerns and issues, and now they're consuming cannabis.
[06:54.240 --> 06:57.640]  In the past two years, they've been happy, and they're pill-free.
[06:57.640 --> 06:59.480]  They're prescription-free.
[06:59.480 --> 07:01.440]  Cannabis saved this person's life.
[07:01.440 --> 07:04.040]  I'm not sure if they want their name said.
[07:04.040 --> 07:09.760]  I probably said their name on the last time I read their email, but hey, dude, thank you
[07:09.760 --> 07:10.760]  for sharing this.
[07:10.760 --> 07:11.760]  This means a lot.
[07:11.760 --> 07:13.120]  That's a lot to open up and let out.
[07:13.120 --> 07:17.040]  I am really glad that you were on team cannabis now, and I'm really glad that cannabis saved
[07:17.040 --> 07:18.040]  your life.
[07:18.040 --> 07:19.240]  That is amazing.
[07:19.240 --> 07:21.120]  The email keeps going, and it just gets better.
[07:21.120 --> 07:26.880]  He says, I can now function, laugh, smile, and be around my wife and three amazing little
[07:26.880 --> 07:27.880]  boys.
[07:27.880 --> 07:34.120]  You guys, this guy eliminated prescriptions and is treating his mental health with cannabis,
[07:34.120 --> 07:37.040]  and it is allowing him to be happy for two years.
[07:37.040 --> 07:38.360]  He said he's happy.
[07:38.360 --> 07:40.520]  People don't say they're happy and not mean it.
[07:40.520 --> 07:41.520]  He's happy.
[07:41.520 --> 07:44.200]  He's able to function, which is important.
[07:44.200 --> 07:47.860]  Sometimes mental health will stop you from being able to basically function.
[07:47.860 --> 07:49.120]  You can't do your daily shit.
[07:49.120 --> 07:50.360]  You just can't get up.
[07:50.360 --> 07:51.720]  You can't put your fucking shoes on.
[07:51.720 --> 07:53.960]  You can't do what needs to be done because you're depressed.
[07:53.960 --> 07:57.360]  You're overwhelmed by these disgusting feelings that come through your mind.
[07:57.360 --> 07:58.360]  You can't.
[07:58.360 --> 07:59.360]  It's hard.
[07:59.360 --> 08:01.360]  Unless you've faced it, you have no idea what it's like.
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.600]  This person is fighting it with cannabis.
[08:03.600 --> 08:04.600]  He can function.
[08:04.600 --> 08:08.000]  He can laugh, and he can smile, which is beyond functioning.
[08:08.000 --> 08:09.480]  That's enjoyment.
[08:09.480 --> 08:13.380]  Cannabis is improving the quality of this man's life, and he's able to be around his
[08:13.380 --> 08:17.800]  wife and three amazing little boys, which means cannabis is improving the lives of five
[08:17.800 --> 08:21.760]  people, probably spiraling out, rippling out to more people.
[08:21.760 --> 08:25.320]  He's probably improving grandma's life, grandpa's life.
[08:25.320 --> 08:29.000]  Everybody's happier because this guy is consuming cannabis and keeping his mental health in
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.880]  check without taking damaging prescriptions, nasty, addictive prescriptions that are probably
[08:34.880 --> 08:37.960]  causing more problems than they were helping.
[08:37.960 --> 08:42.120]  This guy has changed his life by using cannabis, and he was kind enough to share this information
[08:42.120 --> 08:44.440]  with us, which is a tremendous story, and I appreciate it.
[08:44.440 --> 08:45.440]  There's more to it.
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.280]  It says, growing is one of the most rewarding things I've done for myself.
[08:49.280 --> 08:52.640]  Thank you again for being kind enough to answer some of my questions.
[08:52.640 --> 08:58.040]  Yourself in a very big way is contributing to steady increase in mental health and happiness.
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.080]  Hey, that makes it all worth it.
[09:01.080 --> 09:02.680]  This podcast is a lot of work.
[09:02.680 --> 09:04.160]  I'm sitting here on a Tuesday evening.
[09:04.160 --> 09:05.400]  I should be hanging out with some friends.
[09:05.400 --> 09:08.920]  I should be doing something with a pretty lady, and I'm recording a podcast because
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.040]  I love it, and I love helping you guys, and these types of emails make it all worth it.
[09:14.040 --> 09:17.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, this person is treating their mental health with cannabis, and they're
[09:17.640 --> 09:21.320]  able to function with their family and society.
[09:21.320 --> 09:22.320]  That means a lot to me.
[09:22.320 --> 09:25.720]  I'm glad I was able to help you in your garden and get your problems dialed in, but I am
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.760]  way happier and way more proud that I am able to help you out with your mental health and
[09:30.760 --> 09:32.280]  improve your life.
[09:32.280 --> 09:35.400]  You said that growing is one of the most rewarding things you've done for yourself.
[09:35.400 --> 09:37.800]  Dude, me too.
[09:37.800 --> 09:38.880]  Oh my goodness.
[09:38.880 --> 09:40.380]  I've done a lot of things.
[09:40.380 --> 09:42.560]  I've achieved a lot of things.
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.880]  When I started growing and I was able to produce quality cannabis for myself without having
[09:46.880 --> 09:52.040]  to go buy it or seek it out or search for it, that was such a great feeling of self-sufficiency.
[09:52.040 --> 09:56.400]  I was able to provide this product for myself without spending too much money.
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.840]  Then I was able to grow it and start spreading it out to people who were actually sick.
[10:01.840 --> 10:06.200]  I was able to get my medicine into the hands of people who were mentally and physically
[10:06.200 --> 10:11.400]  ill and were able to use products that I grew to improve the quality and comfort level of
[10:11.400 --> 10:12.440]  their life.
[10:12.440 --> 10:18.400]  They were able to consume a product that I planted into dirt and nourished for 13, 14,
[10:18.400 --> 10:24.080]  16 weeks, harvested it, dried it and cured it, delivered it to them, hung out and smoked
[10:24.080 --> 10:26.620]  it with them and watched them change.
[10:26.620 --> 10:31.200]  From the time I got there, I rang the doorbell and you got the, hold on, I'm coming.
[10:31.200 --> 10:32.200]  I'm old.
[10:32.200 --> 10:33.200]  It's going to take me a little while.
[10:33.200 --> 10:34.200]  God damn it.
[10:34.200 --> 10:35.440]  I'm old and I don't fucking feel good.
[10:35.440 --> 10:37.360]  And they get to the door and they're like, oh, it's you.
[10:37.360 --> 10:38.360]  I'm sorry.
[10:38.360 --> 10:39.360]  I'm grouchy.
[10:39.360 --> 10:40.360]  I don't feel good.
[10:40.360 --> 10:41.360]  It's good to see you sit down.
[10:41.360 --> 10:43.080]  And you sit down and you can tell on their face, they're not feeling well and they're
[10:43.080 --> 10:45.760]  pissed off that they had to answer the door and someone's in their damn house.
[10:45.760 --> 10:47.360]  And you're like, yeah, I brought you this medicine.
[10:47.360 --> 10:49.600]  I know you've been sick, but do you want to try this?
[10:49.600 --> 10:51.720]  And they're like, well, they're starting to get excited.
[10:51.720 --> 10:52.720]  You know, you grew some weed.
[10:52.720 --> 10:54.960]  I'm going to fucking smoke some weed with you.
[10:54.960 --> 10:57.560]  Then you smoke it and you share it with them.
[10:57.560 --> 11:02.200]  And he watched their face go from angry to hungry, some good tasty weed.
[11:02.200 --> 11:04.400]  And then he watched their shoulders go down.
[11:04.400 --> 11:05.880]  Shoulders start relaxing a little bit.
[11:05.880 --> 11:10.240]  Then you see him sit back in the chair a little bit and the arms uncross and the legs uncross
[11:10.240 --> 11:12.600]  and they start relaxing and start feeling better.
[11:12.600 --> 11:14.440]  They're not in pain.
[11:14.440 --> 11:17.820]  The symptoms of their illness have kind of subsided long enough for them to actually
[11:17.820 --> 11:19.560]  enjoy life.
[11:19.560 --> 11:22.580]  And then you're actually, I'm actually hanging out with them and spending a minute with them.
[11:22.580 --> 11:24.560]  So they're getting to feel physically better.
[11:24.560 --> 11:27.860]  They're getting to feel mentally better and they're getting some social interaction.
[11:27.860 --> 11:31.040]  So that feeling, trust me, I know the feeling that you're talking about.
[11:31.040 --> 11:34.880]  You're saying that growing was one of the most rewarding things you've done for yourself.
[11:34.880 --> 11:39.480]  I get to grow cannabis and then watch sick people feel better.
[11:39.480 --> 11:42.280]  So I know what you're talking about is the short version of what I'm trying to say.
[11:42.280 --> 11:44.160]  I'm sorry I rambled on for so long about that.
[11:44.160 --> 11:49.600]  This is supposed to be a quickie, but I know that feeling and it is tremendous.
[11:49.600 --> 11:53.040]  And then he goes on to say, thank you for being kind enough to answer some of my questions.
[11:53.040 --> 11:55.880]  I didn't know what I was getting into when I answered your first question.
[11:55.880 --> 11:59.200]  I thought it was answering a grow question and now we've become friends and we're talking
[11:59.200 --> 12:01.440]  about your mental health and how I've improved your life.
[12:01.440 --> 12:04.440]  So dude, thank you for sharing that with me.
[12:04.440 --> 12:05.640]  That means a lot to me.
[12:05.640 --> 12:07.160]  That's tremendous.
[12:07.160 --> 12:12.480]  And it's good to know that I'm contributing to steady increase in mental health and happiness.
[12:12.480 --> 12:13.480]  That is great.
[12:13.480 --> 12:17.280]  Somebody in an Instagram feed told me that I was an asset to our community and that meant
[12:17.280 --> 12:18.280]  a lot to me also.
[12:18.280 --> 12:21.920]  So you guys with all the huge compliments, it does not go unnoticed.
[12:21.920 --> 12:22.920]  I appreciate it.
[12:22.920 --> 12:23.920]  Thank you for the encouragement.
[12:23.920 --> 12:26.440]  It keeps me going.
[12:26.440 --> 12:29.240]  So hey, to the dude that sent me this email, I don't know if you want me to say your name
[12:29.240 --> 12:30.840]  again since you revealed so much.
[12:30.840 --> 12:31.840]  Thank you.
[12:31.840 --> 12:36.960]  I'm glad I was able to improve your garden and I am ecstatic that I'm able to improve
[12:36.960 --> 12:40.320]  your mental health and help you improve your mental health and make your life with your
[12:40.320 --> 12:41.320]  family better.
[12:41.320 --> 12:42.720]  And thanks for being on Team Cannabis.
[12:42.720 --> 12:45.800]  Thanks for having the balls to join us.
[12:45.800 --> 12:46.800]  I appreciate it.
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.640]  Thanks for not being afraid and for stepping outside of the box and for having faith in
[12:51.640 --> 12:52.640]  something.
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.320]  And now share that story with more people like you just did me so that we can get more
[12:57.320 --> 13:00.000]  people to join Team Cannabis.
[13:00.000 --> 13:01.000]  Thank you.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  You guys send me more emails.
[13:02.000 --> 13:03.000]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.440]  I would love to hear from you.
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.840]  I'm going to keep it quick, but I've got one more email that I'm going to try to get through
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.840]  quickly here.
[13:10.840 --> 13:13.960]  This one, this one comes from a long time listener.
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.080]  This one is actually an old email that I found in the archive folder.
[13:17.080 --> 13:18.160]  I'm trying to catch them all up.
[13:18.160 --> 13:20.520]  I hope you're still listening to the show.
[13:20.520 --> 13:21.840]  This email goes like this.
[13:22.040 --> 13:25.960]  Hey Jeff, I've been a long time listener and had dreams of making it into the industry.
[13:25.960 --> 13:30.160]  I moved out to Cali and eventually landed my first actual grow job working at newly
[13:30.160 --> 13:32.080]  started MedGrow here.
[13:32.080 --> 13:35.520]  Unfortunately, my bosses are very new to the game as well.
[13:35.520 --> 13:39.640]  And in my opinion, it looks like they're making some critical errors.
[13:39.640 --> 13:41.160]  They're also very stubborn.
[13:41.160 --> 13:44.160]  So I wanted to get some solid facts and feedback from a pro.
[13:44.160 --> 13:49.000]  Then he goes on to say we're running basic ocean forest soil mix with smart pots under
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.160]  LEDs.
[13:50.160 --> 13:54.400]  They currently have been feeding the flower room every day with the nutrient mix every
[13:54.400 --> 13:55.400]  time.
[13:55.400 --> 14:01.240]  Now, shouldn't there be a mix of some freshwater only waterings too, or is this okay?
[14:01.240 --> 14:05.600]  And also they are feeding every plant every day, even if the soil is still moist from
[14:05.600 --> 14:07.120]  yesterday's feeding.
[14:07.120 --> 14:10.940]  Is there any additional dangers to that besides the chance of root rot from not letting the
[14:10.940 --> 14:12.600]  soil dry ever?
[14:12.600 --> 14:16.400]  Thanks again for putting out all the info and keep up the great work.
[14:16.400 --> 14:17.400]  All right.
[14:17.400 --> 14:19.160]  That there's a lot of stuff to go on there.
[14:19.160 --> 14:20.880]  Thank you for the compliments at the end there.
[14:20.880 --> 14:24.040]  You're welcome for me putting out all the info and I promise you to keep up all of the
[14:24.040 --> 14:26.120]  great work as long as I'm able.
[14:26.120 --> 14:29.000]  Now let's get into the email and answer a couple of things.
[14:29.000 --> 14:30.000]  Longtime listener, dude.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.000]  Thanks a lot.
[14:31.000 --> 14:32.000]  I appreciate that.
[14:32.000 --> 14:33.240]  Dreams of making it into the industry.
[14:33.240 --> 14:34.960]  It looks like you did it.
[14:34.960 --> 14:35.960]  You did it.
[14:35.960 --> 14:36.960]  So step one, complete.
[14:36.960 --> 14:39.040]  Now you've noticed some problems.
[14:39.040 --> 14:42.200]  Your bosses are new and they're fucking it up and they're stubborn.
[14:42.200 --> 14:43.880]  Hey, no surprise.
[14:43.880 --> 14:45.800]  All the bosses are fucking stubborn.
[14:45.800 --> 14:46.800]  Don't worry.
[14:46.800 --> 14:47.800]  That's how it's going to be.
[14:47.800 --> 14:48.800]  It's how it's going to be.
[14:48.800 --> 14:49.800]  Just get used to that.
[14:49.800 --> 14:56.160]  So you say you're running ocean forest soil with smart pots under LEDs.
[14:56.160 --> 14:57.160]  That works.
[14:57.160 --> 15:01.400]  You're currently feeding the flower room every day with the new mix every time.
[15:01.400 --> 15:05.600]  Now your question is, shouldn't there be a mix of some freshwater feedings or is this
[15:05.600 --> 15:07.600]  okay?
[15:07.600 --> 15:14.500]  I would think that since you're using ocean forest soil, if you are feeding bottled nutrients
[15:14.500 --> 15:17.860]  every day, you are going to run into problems.
[15:17.860 --> 15:19.780]  Yes, you are going to get salt buildups.
[15:19.780 --> 15:23.320]  That is going to be too much.
[15:23.320 --> 15:29.200]  If they are using nothing but organic teas and non-bottled nutrients, that may work because
[15:29.200 --> 15:33.940]  the organics, hopefully they cycle quickly enough and they're not overfeeding enough
[15:33.940 --> 15:38.180]  to where it won't burn the plants and you won't get salt buildups, but that's highly
[15:38.180 --> 15:40.300]  unlikely that's what they were doing.
[15:40.300 --> 15:42.940]  I'm going to assume they're just mixing up from everything else you said.
[15:42.940 --> 15:47.540]  I'm going to assume they're mixing up some bottled nutrients and you are correct.
[15:47.540 --> 15:52.760]  That is going to eventually cause, it's going to be over-nutriented, it's going to be over-fertilized,
[15:52.760 --> 15:54.980]  it's going to have too much salts in there.
[15:54.980 --> 15:58.460]  The pH is going to get off, it's going to start getting salt binding to the roots, the
[15:58.460 --> 16:00.980]  plants are going to start locking out, the leaves are going to start curling up, things
[16:00.980 --> 16:02.420]  are going to get dry and crispy.
[16:02.420 --> 16:04.840]  It'll look like a CalMag deficiency.
[16:04.840 --> 16:08.620]  It's going to be an everything overfeeding and the pH will get fucked up will probably
[16:08.620 --> 16:11.180]  be the first thing that happens.
[16:11.180 --> 16:12.580]  So yeah, you are correct.
[16:12.580 --> 16:18.780]  There should be a freshwater feeding in there probably every other time.
[16:18.780 --> 16:20.980]  Something like that just to clean out all that salt.
[16:20.980 --> 16:23.300]  You don't want to go so hard with the nutrients.
[16:23.300 --> 16:25.260]  I don't know what they're feeding.
[16:25.260 --> 16:28.340]  They may be feeding something gentle and it may be working.
[16:28.340 --> 16:29.340]  This email is old.
[16:29.340 --> 16:30.980]  I'm looking at the date you sent me this.
[16:30.980 --> 16:31.980]  Let me know how this worked out.
[16:31.980 --> 16:33.460]  Did this crop come out like shit?
[16:33.460 --> 16:35.240]  Did this crop come out okay?
[16:35.240 --> 16:36.420]  What have you done about this?
[16:36.420 --> 16:39.740]  I'm curious, but I want to keep reading the email because we can still help people.
[16:39.740 --> 16:44.060]  You say, and I agree, there should be some, if you're in cocoa, you can do nutrients
[16:44.060 --> 16:45.060]  every time.
[16:45.060 --> 16:47.760]  Cocoa does not hold onto nutrients.
[16:47.760 --> 16:52.540]  Cocoa has a low cation exchange rate and the nutrients fall right out of the cocoa.
[16:52.540 --> 16:53.780]  Nothing binds into there.
[16:53.780 --> 16:55.500]  The soil will hold onto it.
[16:55.500 --> 16:56.940]  It will start coming alive.
[16:56.940 --> 16:57.940]  Things will start growing.
[16:57.940 --> 16:59.660]  It'll colonize inside of there.
[16:59.660 --> 17:03.660]  You'll create a little, it's called the rhizosphere.
[17:03.660 --> 17:09.500]  You'll create a little environment, a little biosphere inside your plant, inside your container.
[17:09.540 --> 17:12.620]  That's going to start going on in there if you're feeding a bunch of stuff all the time.
[17:12.620 --> 17:16.820]  I don't know what they're putting in there, but there's life happening and eventually
[17:16.820 --> 17:19.420]  you'll get too much salt in there and you'll destroy that life.
[17:19.420 --> 17:22.420]  You'll get a lot of life, then you'll destroy the life, then everything will lock out and
[17:22.420 --> 17:23.420]  you'll get problems.
[17:23.420 --> 17:25.680]  So yeah, there should be a water feeding in there.
[17:25.680 --> 17:26.820]  I would recommend that.
[17:26.820 --> 17:30.980]  Then he also says they're also feeding the plant every day, even if the soil is moist
[17:30.980 --> 17:33.440]  from yesterday's feeding.
[17:33.440 --> 17:34.700]  That's not a good idea.
[17:34.700 --> 17:37.420]  I like to let them dry out, especially in soil.
[17:37.420 --> 17:41.540]  I like to get them almost scary dry if you're in soil or soilless mix and you're in Fox
[17:41.540 --> 17:44.260]  farms, so you can let them get really dry.
[17:44.260 --> 17:47.180]  They'll actually perform better if you let them get dry.
[17:47.180 --> 17:51.220]  As the plants go from really wet to really dry, the pH changes drastically in the root
[17:51.220 --> 17:54.900]  zone and that makes more nutrients available.
[17:54.900 --> 17:57.520]  Different nutrients are available at different pHs.
[17:57.520 --> 18:01.300]  We try to dial it into a certain range where everything is available optimally, but some
[18:01.300 --> 18:04.420]  things are better and more available at higher and lower pHs.
[18:04.420 --> 18:07.580]  So as things swing, it'll be able to get different things.
[18:07.580 --> 18:09.780]  Also it likes that wet and dry time.
[18:09.780 --> 18:13.180]  Cannabis just really enjoys that wet and dry time.
[18:13.180 --> 18:16.260]  You'll see the plant cycle better when they get some time to dry down.
[18:16.260 --> 18:21.260]  So watering the plant every day, even if the soil is still moist, is not a good idea.
[18:21.260 --> 18:22.740]  I would let it dry out.
[18:22.740 --> 18:26.260]  Why not water it in the morning on day one?
[18:26.260 --> 18:28.900]  Let it go all the way until the end of day two, maybe.
[18:28.900 --> 18:32.380]  You know, if it's still wet when you come in in the morning, wait until you leave before
[18:32.380 --> 18:33.620]  you're going to leave to water it again.
[18:33.620 --> 18:36.740]  You don't have to water everything in the morning just because that's the schedule.
[18:36.740 --> 18:37.740]  They're plants.
[18:37.740 --> 18:39.020]  The plants are the fucking boss.
[18:39.020 --> 18:40.020]  Listen to them.
[18:40.020 --> 18:44.940]  Uh, also, is there any additional dangers to that besides the chance of root rot from
[18:44.940 --> 18:46.380]  not letting the soil dry ever?
[18:46.380 --> 18:48.020]  Yes, it will slow your growth.
[18:48.020 --> 18:49.700]  The plants will say, what the fuck?
[18:49.700 --> 18:50.700]  It's soggy.
[18:50.700 --> 18:51.700]  It's swampy.
[18:51.700 --> 18:53.460]  I don't want to grow in a swampy, soggy mess.
[18:53.460 --> 18:55.980]  So my roots aren't going to grow as quickly as they should.
[18:55.980 --> 18:56.980]  And it's going to slow down.
[18:56.980 --> 18:58.940]  You're going to get less harvest weight.
[18:58.940 --> 19:01.380]  You're going to get less production out of the plants and you're going to have too much
[19:01.380 --> 19:03.040]  moisture in the room.
[19:03.040 --> 19:06.480]  All of that water in the soil is also evaporating into the air.
[19:06.480 --> 19:08.320]  So you're going to increase humidity.
[19:08.320 --> 19:10.640]  You're going to bring fungus gnats.
[19:10.640 --> 19:13.960]  You're just asking for problems with that much extra moisture.
[19:13.960 --> 19:15.020]  Let the shit dry.
[19:15.020 --> 19:16.560]  The roots will grow more quickly.
[19:16.560 --> 19:18.200]  The plants will take off.
[19:18.200 --> 19:19.880]  You'll see it.
[19:19.880 --> 19:21.960]  Let them get to where you're almost worried about it.
[19:21.960 --> 19:25.960]  In soilless mix, it's best to get them to where you're almost, you're like, oh, these
[19:25.960 --> 19:28.600]  leaves are starting to go down right when the leaves start to droop.
[19:28.600 --> 19:29.880]  Water them then.
