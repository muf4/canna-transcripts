[03:51.420 --> 03:55.660]  We've got a great episode lined up for you. Jesse is back to give us another outdoor grow lesson.
[03:56.780 --> 04:01.660]  I also want to read a little bit of news before we get to that. So let's get down to it.
[04:09.250 --> 04:14.850]  All right. This story comes from The Cannabis. It was actually written by John Engel of the Denver Post.
[04:15.410 --> 04:21.490]  The headline is Police Stings No Pot Shops Found Selling Marijuana to Minors, MED says.
[04:23.090 --> 04:27.410]  Police have so far sanctioned no recreational marijuana stores for selling to minors during
[04:27.410 --> 04:31.170]  underage compliance stings across the state, according to Colorado Department of Revenue.
[04:32.050 --> 04:35.730]  Authorities in Denver and Pueblo, working with regulators from the state marijuana
[04:35.730 --> 04:40.370]  enforcement division, have conducted 20 undercover stings in which they see whether a
[04:40.370 --> 04:46.050]  store will sell pot to someone under 21. 16 of the compliance checks have occurred in Denver,
[04:46.050 --> 04:52.290]  home to most of the state's recreational marijuana stores. So far, no store has sold to someone under
[04:52.290 --> 04:58.450]  21 in the checks. So they sent undercovers around to dispensaries to go try to buy weed, and they
[04:58.450 --> 05:03.010]  sent people that weren't 21, and those people were turned away by every shop that they went to.
[05:03.010 --> 05:07.730]  So good job, Colorado. That is proof right there that we can follow the rules.
[05:07.730 --> 05:12.370]  The people that own these businesses do not want to risk their businesses by selling to somebody
[05:12.370 --> 05:18.290]  under 21. There are plenty of people 21 and older coming from out of state to buy herb, so they
[05:18.290 --> 05:22.610]  don't even need to risk it. I don't... Yeah. So good job, you guys. Good job for following the
[05:22.610 --> 05:27.650]  rules. So the article continues, and it says, it is imperative that we keep marijuana out of the
[05:27.650 --> 05:31.890]  hands of kids. Barbara Broll, the executive director of the Department of Revenue, which
[05:31.890 --> 05:37.010]  includes the marijuana enforcement division, said in a statement, these results show that strong
[05:37.010 --> 05:41.810]  efforts are being made by the MED and the marijuana business license to do just that.
[05:43.010 --> 05:49.010]  Oh, licensees. Sorry. Marijuana business licensees to do just that. While medical marijuana stores
[05:49.010 --> 05:53.010]  can sell to registered patients under 21, recreational stores can only sell to those
[05:53.010 --> 05:58.130]  over 21 and must check identification. Stores that are found selling to someone under age could have
[05:58.130 --> 06:06.690]  their license suspended or revoked or face a fine up to $100,000. It says here medical marijuana
[06:06.690 --> 06:11.330]  stores can sell to registered patients under 21. If you are a Colorado resident, you're a medical
[06:11.330 --> 06:17.330]  marijuana patient that's under 21, then you can go to the medical marijuana stores as long as you
[06:17.330 --> 06:22.210]  have your card. You can go to the medical shops. If you're under 18 to get medical marijuana,
[06:22.210 --> 06:26.210]  you have to be seen by two doctors, I believe. That could be under 21 as well. I think it's
[06:26.210 --> 06:29.890]  under 18. If you're under 18, you have to be seen by two doctors at the same time and they
[06:29.890 --> 06:35.730]  both have to approve your medical marijuana evaluation. So that's one of the little why
[06:35.730 --> 06:41.410]  they mentioned that people under 21 can get into some shops, only the medical shops. So it continues,
[06:41.410 --> 06:45.890]  it wraps up with, we are pleased with the results and we'll continue to monitor the businesses to
[06:45.890 --> 06:52.850]  ensure the compliance efforts are maintained. Well, good job, Colorado. I'm proud of you guys.
[06:52.850 --> 06:55.970]  I'm glad that you're not selling to the people that you're not supposed to. I'm glad you're doing
[06:55.970 --> 07:00.610]  your job and checking your IDs. They mentioned Pueblo directly. So shout out to all my friends
[07:00.610 --> 07:05.490]  in Pueblo that have shops that are following the rules. Thank you for doing it right. I don't know
[07:05.490 --> 07:11.330]  if you guys realize it, you are the example. All eyes in the world of weed are on Colorado right
[07:11.330 --> 07:15.330]  now. So do it right. Don't fuck it up for everybody. Do it right. You're doing a good
[07:15.330 --> 07:19.730]  job. So I'll give you praise. Good job, guys. All right. I've got one more piece of news that
[07:19.730 --> 07:22.930]  I found really interesting, and then we're going to go ahead and get into the grow lesson with
[07:22.930 --> 07:31.410]  Jesse. This one is from the Denver post written by David Magoya. It says Colorado's 40 casinos and
[07:31.410 --> 07:36.850]  hundreds of others, including the gaming Mecca in Las Vegas are bound by the same money reporting
[07:36.850 --> 07:41.410]  rules that have made banks reluctant to let legal marijuana businesses open bank accounts.
[07:41.410 --> 07:46.850]  Federal authorities now say that means casinos can keep anyone associated with legal weed
[07:46.850 --> 07:52.530]  enterprise from dispensary to grow operations away from gambling tables anywhere in the country.
[07:53.170 --> 07:58.130]  And if they do allow them to play, casinos must file the same suspicious activity reports. Banks
[07:58.130 --> 08:02.450]  must file whenever they handle money derived from pot profits. According to the financial
[08:02.450 --> 08:06.210]  crimes enforcement network, a division of the U.S. department of the treasury.
[08:08.050 --> 08:12.690]  Fin sends guidance supplies to all financial institutions covered under the Fin Sen
[08:12.690 --> 08:18.210]  regulations, including casinos. Fin sends public affairs director Stephen Hudak told the Denver
[08:18.210 --> 08:23.250]  post. So this is going out to all my friends that like to go party in Vegas and have a good time.
[08:23.250 --> 08:27.730]  We need to quit wearing our brand shirts and we can't talk about what we do if we are in the
[08:27.730 --> 08:33.970]  cannabis industry. So what goes on to say, because the government says casinos are financial
[08:33.970 --> 08:39.890]  institutions like banks, they must have stringent anti-money laundering programs in place.
[08:40.770 --> 08:45.570]  Filing suspicious activity reports or S.A.R.S. to crack down on money laundering by criminal
[08:45.570 --> 08:50.530]  and terrorist organizations is not new for casinos. What is new is that it now extends to
[08:50.530 --> 08:55.250]  the legal marijuana trade. While Fin Sen in February announced how banks could work with
[08:55.250 --> 08:59.730]  legal marijuana businesses, the government only now realized that extends to casinos.
[09:00.690 --> 09:06.370]  That's in any casino in the country, whether in Colorado, Atlantic city or Las Vegas on land,
[09:06.370 --> 09:11.970]  on water or on sovereign American Indian soil. So casino in the Las Vegas strip would by law
[09:11.970 --> 09:16.450]  have to pay attention to the owner of a marijuana dispensary in Colorado who heads there to gamble.
[09:18.130 --> 09:22.610]  Is it that trippy? Isn't that weird? So if you're from Colorado and you go there and you're kind of
[09:22.610 --> 09:25.730]  looking like you got some loot because you own a dispensary and you're trying to treat your
[09:25.730 --> 09:32.690]  employees, you are now suspicious and your money will be reported. So currently 22 States have
[09:32.690 --> 09:38.050]  legalized the sale of medical marijuana and two Colorado and Washington have legalized recreational
[09:38.050 --> 09:42.610]  sales. Colorado and 41 other States have some form of legal casino gambling.
[09:44.130 --> 09:49.490]  The news revealed June 12th that a Las Vegas conference directed at curtailing money laundering
[09:49.490 --> 09:52.770]  has stopped state regulators and the casino industry in its tracks.
[09:53.490 --> 09:58.770]  The Colorado division of gaming was unaware of the Fin Sen guidance. Spokeswoman Cameron Lewis
[09:58.770 --> 10:05.090]  told the post division management will be taking this matter under discussion. Similarly, the
[10:05.090 --> 10:09.970]  Colorado gaming association, the trade group that represents the States casinos was unaware of the
[10:09.970 --> 10:15.250]  requirement. To my knowledge, we have not been contacted by Fin Sen regarding any issues dealing
[10:15.250 --> 10:22.050]  with marijuana suppliers. Executive director Lois Rice said like banks, casinos must know their
[10:22.050 --> 10:29.170]  customer and have some knowledge of their source of funds. How I've been to casinos and nobody in
[10:29.170 --> 10:34.450]  there gave a shit what my source of funds was. They had no idea how to tell as far as they could
[10:34.450 --> 10:39.650]  tell. I worked at a shoe store like they had no idea. So unless you're going in there with your
[10:39.650 --> 10:45.330]  brand shirt on, unless your shirt says I make cash or the big green dispensary, then you should be
[10:45.330 --> 10:49.890]  cool. But be careful if your money, uh, if your money stinks like weed, if you happen to keep your
[10:49.890 --> 10:54.930]  money and your weed and a safe together or somewhere near air your money out before you go to
[10:54.930 --> 11:00.370]  Vegas or just stop at your local bank in Colorado, make a deposit and then pull more money out later
[11:00.370 --> 11:05.890]  so that you just traded money for that stinky money for non-stinky ass money. I just don't want
[11:05.890 --> 11:11.170]  to take your stinky weed smelling money to Las Vegas or any casino. We've got plenty of casinos
[11:11.170 --> 11:16.050]  in Colorado. We've got cripple Creek and shit. So be careful going there. Uh, here we go. I'll read
[11:16.050 --> 11:24.130]  more. No, their customers. Where was I? Um, the casino industry keeps close track of gamblers
[11:24.130 --> 11:28.290]  through a variety of methods, including high roller clubs, frequent player programs, and other
[11:28.290 --> 11:33.170]  in-house incentives. Casinos must comply with the government's guidance on filing suspicious
[11:33.170 --> 11:38.930]  activity reports, said Jim Dowling, an anti-Monday money laundering consultant. Their alternative is
[11:38.930 --> 11:43.170]  not to conduct a financial transaction with these individuals who were involved directly or
[11:43.170 --> 11:48.530]  indirectly in the MJ business, said Dowling, a former IRS agent who was also an advisor on money
[11:48.530 --> 11:53.570]  laundering issues to the white house because marijuana is illegal under federal law. Fin
[11:53.570 --> 11:57.650]  sends requirements for doing business with the marijuana industry modified how financial
[11:57.650 --> 12:03.490]  institutions are to file SARS SARS, uh, suspicious activity reports is what that means.
[12:04.850 --> 12:10.290]  The reports must now reflect that clients are in States where marijuana sales are allowed. So if
[12:10.290 --> 12:14.850]  you win a big jackpot and you got to show your ID and your ID, because you got to show them that
[12:14.850 --> 12:21.090]  you're 21. If you collect a big ass prize, um, the ID is going to show Colorado is your home state
[12:21.090 --> 12:25.490]  on there. And they're going to make note of that. They're going to fill out a suspicious activity
[12:25.490 --> 12:30.130]  report on your ass. The marijuana specific reports would either identify the cannabis
[12:30.130 --> 12:34.290]  related business or employee as legally operating under appropriate guidelines,
[12:34.290 --> 12:38.850]  identify them as one conducting subsist suspicious activity, or as one where the
[12:38.850 --> 12:44.770]  casino has ended its banking relationship in order to maintain an effective anti money laundering
[12:44.770 --> 12:50.610]  compliance program. The seven page guidance also notes a number of red flag scenarios that would
[12:50.610 --> 12:56.770]  require a bank or casino to file an SAR, including for a customer depositing cash that smells like
[12:56.770 --> 13:01.810]  marijuana who might be trying to conceal involvement in marijuana related business activity.
[13:02.370 --> 13:06.850]  So I mentioned that earlier, and I honestly hadn't read that paragraph. They're paying attention. If
[13:06.850 --> 13:12.210]  your weed smells, if your money smells like weed, they are flagging it something for all of us to
[13:12.210 --> 13:16.290]  think about. Maybe you just have your herb and your money in the same pocket, you know, and then
[13:16.290 --> 13:20.770]  you end up going to the bank and you make a deposit and that money reeks like herb if you
[13:20.770 --> 13:25.810]  got the dank. So be careful. Be careful if you're in Vegas, be careful if you're at the bank, just
[13:25.810 --> 13:32.050]  be careful. They're looking for more and more ways to build a case on people now. All right. I think
[13:32.050 --> 13:36.530]  that's enough news for the day. I'm going to take a couple of fat dabs and I will be right back with
[13:36.530 --> 13:48.650]  the grow lesson with our buddy, Jesse. Hang tight while I smoke down. This outdoor grow lesson is
[13:48.650 --> 13:53.770]  brought to you by hygro indoor growing supplies. Hygro indoor growing supplies has two locations to

[14:18.330 --> 14:24.970]  them Rasta Jeff sent you. So I got a friend who sent me a text one time you were here for the show
[14:24.970 --> 14:29.450]  and your quote was, uh, you know, the show has started when Jeff's coughing his lungs out.
[14:29.450 --> 14:34.170]  She sent me a text that said exactly that just to laugh at me. I thought that was funny. So shout
[14:34.170 --> 14:37.050]  out. She knows who she is. What's up, dread girl. Thanks for listening to the show all the way in
[14:37.050 --> 14:42.570]  California. That was supposed to be California, but I just took some dabs and uh, my lips and
[14:42.570 --> 14:46.650]  lungs and throat are not cooperating. What's up guys. We're back with Jesse. We got him here to
[14:46.650 --> 14:50.570]  teach us some gross stuff. I almost said your last name again. I ended it out one time last
[14:50.570 --> 14:56.810]  time because they did my bad. It's all good. Hey, what's up everyone. So, uh, we're going to get
[14:56.810 --> 15:00.890]  right down to it. We're doing some outdoor growing and Jesse's here to teach us how to do it. Uh,
[15:00.890 --> 15:05.770]  this is his third visit. I hope you've been paying attention. Uh, in the last episode or
[15:05.770 --> 15:08.970]  not the last episode, the last time Jesse was here, sorry, we're dabbed the fuck out. It seems
[15:08.970 --> 15:13.450]  like we get higher as soon as the microphones come on to like, Oh, extra high. All right. The
[15:13.450 --> 15:18.250]  last time you're listening, they can hear me. They know what time, man. So we were talking about
[15:18.250 --> 15:24.250]  security, uh, soil strain selection, uh, teas. We'll talk about teas a little more today. Top
[15:24.250 --> 15:29.530]  feeding. Uh, we're going to talk about topping and training a little bit more. So, uh, what's
[15:29.530 --> 15:34.250]  going on? You said we've got about 25 days until we flower right at this point, right? Yeah. 25,
[15:34.250 --> 15:40.890]  30, hopefully you said 25, 30 days before that. Uh, the stretch period is like really noticeable
[15:40.890 --> 15:48.410]  and stuff, you know, um, for lack of scientific terms, how many days, uh, excuse me, how many
[15:48.410 --> 15:53.450]  days until you think we see that stretch period? Probably about 25. Okay. It'll start in 25 days.
[15:53.450 --> 15:59.930]  Okay. So then we won't see a little bud sites forming for probably 40 days ish. Um, well it's
[16:00.010 --> 16:08.890]  outside. So yeah, that really depends on strain. Um, and even location on a certain property, uh,
[16:09.450 --> 16:16.970]  can, uh, you know, change flowering times and stuff. Um, if there's like a structure or a tree
[16:16.970 --> 16:22.890]  or something like that, uh, I've, you know, seen a plant start flowering a little bit earlier in one
[16:22.890 --> 16:27.370]  spot as opposed to, you know, same piece of property, a hundred feet away.
[16:27.370 --> 16:34.010]  Wow. Just from one tree or yeah, this was, this was a garage. Okay. Um, what about, uh, what do
[16:34.010 --> 16:37.770]  we do about a streetlight? I know I just kind of went off topic here, but there are, how much are
[16:37.770 --> 16:42.810]  streetlights going to fuck up our flowering streetlights? So it's really going to mess it up.
[16:42.810 --> 16:50.410]  Um, I, I don't know. I've, I've heard that streetlights mess them up. Um, you know, we have
[16:50.410 --> 16:56.650]  really full moon sometimes. Um, I've always really deeply wondered this myself. Um,
[16:59.050 --> 17:05.450]  I don't know. I would assume it's strain specific myself. Yeah. You know, like, uh, some strains
[17:05.450 --> 17:09.850]  are much more resistant to hermine from light leaks or whatever you want to call it. For sure.
[17:09.850 --> 17:15.930]  The harder Indica's are probably going to go a little, uh, be a little more resistant to fucking
[17:15.930 --> 17:20.890]  up. Yeah. They're heavy sativas. They're more tropical hazes, more, more landrace stuff. They're
[17:20.890 --> 17:27.690]  going to herm out. They're not going to like that shit. All right. Um, now I have seen a back porch
[17:27.690 --> 17:34.090]  light, but plant interrupt the light cycle. Um, this was a plant sitting in a container, just
[17:34.090 --> 17:40.330]  like on the dude's back porch. Um, and it totally hermed out, but the light was a lot more direct.
[17:40.330 --> 17:45.450]  Um, you know, it wasn't, you know, 30 feet away and across, you know, the street or something
[17:45.450 --> 17:53.850]  like that. Um, so yeah, so I'd love to hear some, uh, some input from some, you know, listeners on
[17:53.850 --> 17:58.970]  that topic. Yeah. So, uh, it's like you almost have to do a light depth. If you have an outside
[17:58.970 --> 18:03.050]  light somewhere, like a street light near your backyard or whatever, I've got a friend who was
[18:03.050 --> 18:07.290]  actually talking about, uh, his street lights are probably going to fuck up his flowering cycle.
[18:07.290 --> 18:12.250]  For sure. Uh, I told him jokingly, this is not real advice. Don't do this. I told him to get a
[18:12.250 --> 18:21.850]  pellet gun. That's the fucking solution for that shit. Um, that, that, that is a solution to it.
[18:21.850 --> 18:26.650]  That is for sure. I don't know if that's the one I would advise. Yeah. After three or four times
[18:26.650 --> 18:32.410]  of replacing that bulb, the city is going to wonder what's happening. Uh, yeah. So, uh,
[18:32.410 --> 18:36.650]  about 25 days, we'll start seeing it, seeing a stretch phase. Uh, a little bit after that,
[18:36.650 --> 18:41.290]  we'll start seeing our buds. Uh, when should we start changing to a flowering feed?
[18:42.570 --> 18:54.490]  Um, I, I switch over each plant individually. Um, I always, when I do switch to flowering
[18:54.490 --> 19:01.130]  feed, I make a ritual out of, you know, give them like their first high PK, um, top dressing and
[19:01.130 --> 19:09.530]  everything. Um, a little, you know, I still give them nitrogen at that point. Um, outdoor plants
[19:09.530 --> 19:18.010]  just seem to use more nitrogen. Um, okay. I'm helping with the light depth and we're using
[19:18.010 --> 19:23.850]  bottled nutrients because they're container plants, uh, with the concrete floor, um,
[19:24.890 --> 19:31.610]  in, in, in the greenhouse. Um, and I really feel like the cycle we're about to harvest,
[19:31.610 --> 19:36.330]  um, it was nitrogen deficient or just screaming for more nitrogen the whole time.
[19:36.970 --> 19:42.090]  And like, I couldn't really quite figure out what it was because it wasn't just yellowing up or
[19:42.090 --> 19:47.930]  anything, but I feel the sun makes them want to grow taller. I don't know if they're like,
[19:47.930 --> 19:54.010]  I have any scientific evidence behind that. This sun is what this, and you know, that's what they're
[19:54.010 --> 19:59.530]  supposed to get. They need the nitrogen to grow tall. So once you get nitrogen deficient at that
[19:59.530 --> 20:03.210]  phase, you're pretty much SOL, you're going to be chasing it the whole time. That's what we call it.
[20:03.210 --> 20:08.410]  Chasing it. Uh, you said, uh, when you first feed them those flowering nutrients,
[20:08.410 --> 20:12.570]  you want to give them P and K phosphorus and potassium. You guys, those are the things you
[20:12.570 --> 20:19.210]  want to switch to just to, for the new guys, lots of calcium too. If you're using a dry supplements,
[20:19.770 --> 20:24.730]  go, you know, go pretty heavy on that oyster shell or oyster mill. Um,
[20:26.730 --> 20:32.170]  just seems to help produce bigger flowers outside. Um, big, big flowers need lots of calcium. So
[20:34.170 --> 20:40.010]  yeah. So lots of nitrogen. I've got a friend who's growing some plants that are, and I'm not
[20:40.010 --> 20:43.530]  like being shady. I really do have a friend. What's up, Adam? That's what I'm talking about.
[20:43.530 --> 20:46.890]  He's got some plants that are outdoors. I haven't seen them. He keeps saying that the bottom leaves
[20:46.890 --> 20:50.970]  are all yellowing up, but the tops of his plants look fine. They are in containers. He keeps them
[20:50.970 --> 20:55.770]  outdoors. Uh, he feeds them bottled nutrients. Uh, do you think he's just nitrogen deficient
[20:55.770 --> 21:00.250]  since he's outside? Yeah. Um, all right. So Adam, increase your, uh, your nitrogen. That's your
[21:00.250 --> 21:06.650]  girl. You know, also what size of containers, um, he's in little containers, you know, that's the,
[21:06.650 --> 21:11.690]  the, when the plant starts stressing out, you know, it can start as well. I guess it can start
[21:11.690 --> 21:19.610]  wherever, but, um, small pots are, are hard to do outside of their tracks on that, um, to keep
[21:19.610 --> 21:25.450]  them watered adequately. That's a problem he's having. Yeah. And keeping the, uh, the, the
[21:25.450 --> 21:30.250]  roots on cool, uh, the temperature on those black pots can get quite a bit higher than,
[21:32.010 --> 21:37.210]  what size pot should he put them in for outdoor? Um, they're about, uh, maybe two feet tall from
[21:37.210 --> 21:42.490]  the last pictures I saw. They're about 18 inches, two feet tall. Um, I'd seriously probably go for
[21:42.490 --> 21:48.170]  like some 40 gallons, smart pods. You know, it's 20, 25 to 40 gallon. Not going to happen in his
[21:48.170 --> 21:53.450]  world. Yeah. Do you think it'd be cool with a seven gallon pot? Um, that would help a lot.
[21:54.250 --> 21:57.530]  You got to transplant to bigger pots, everybody. All you guys that are growing outside in those
[21:57.530 --> 22:01.210]  little pots, get into bigger pots. Cause you're going to have to feed a lot of water. Cause it's
[22:01.210 --> 22:04.330]  going to get hot out there. It's already getting hot. My buddy's got a water. It was a hundred
[22:04.330 --> 22:09.850]  degrees here today. Uh, I'm sure by the time he woke up, uh, that plant was thirsty as shit. And
[22:09.850 --> 22:15.210]  then I bet he had to water it again at some point. Um, another thing you could do is mulch around the
[22:15.210 --> 22:22.570]  plant. Um, some kind of organic mulch. Um, don't get that stuff. That's really heavily dyed. Um,
[22:23.610 --> 22:29.130]  it might be, yeah, that's the dye washes off and it might get into your container and pot. Doesn't
[22:29.130 --> 22:38.970]  like guys. Um, another thing you can do is trip systems. Um, and then another, an easy fix is a
[22:38.970 --> 22:45.450]  white band of plastic wrapped around the pot. So white side out, change the color of it. Yeah.
[22:46.330 --> 22:50.570]  All right. Uh, you talked about a light deprivation earlier and I kind of skipped
[22:50.570 --> 22:56.890]  right over that. Some people might not know what a light depth is. Yep. So a light depth can be a
[22:56.890 --> 23:01.290]  real pain in the ass is honestly my opinion. It's a lot of work. It's a lot of work. So what you're
[23:01.290 --> 23:06.490]  doing is you're taking a plant that's outside and you basically have to trick it every night to make
[23:06.490 --> 23:12.970]  it think that it's nighttime by putting it. A lot of people will build a greenhouse, an arch shaped
[23:12.970 --> 23:17.770]  greenhouse, a hoop house type of thing. And then you basically pull a tarp over it or some sort of
[23:17.770 --> 23:22.490]  cover over it at the same exact time every night, just like you would turn off your lights in your
[23:22.490 --> 23:27.450]  indoor grow. Uh, the lights will go. And then every morning at the same morning you uncover
[23:27.450 --> 23:31.210]  that bitch so that it's just like it's in the grow room, getting the lights turned off and
[23:31.210 --> 23:35.210]  turned on and it thinks it's the season for it to flower. So that's basically a light depth.
[23:35.210 --> 23:40.410]  There are several ways to do it. Uh, you can bring the plants in, uh, but basically it's
[23:40.410 --> 23:44.410]  covering it that way as a light deprivation. It's a forest flowering your outdoor plants,
[23:45.130 --> 23:51.610]  manipulating, physically manipulating the light cycle. Yeah. Um, it's a lot of work. It's a lot
[23:51.610 --> 23:59.370]  of commitment. Um, so yeah, outdoor growing is not as easy as people would think. Not at all.
[23:59.370 --> 24:03.050]  So we covered, uh, we covered the light depth. We talked about that. We're talking about feeding a
[24:03.050 --> 24:08.890]  little bit, getting my buddy's leaves greener. Uh, so we're talking about chasing the nitrogen,
[24:08.890 --> 24:12.970]  go heavy on the nitrogen guys. I rec, I always recommend, uh, be careful with it, but it sounds
[24:12.970 --> 24:16.890]  like if out, if you're outdoors, that plant's good. How likely are we going to burn it outdoors?
[24:16.890 --> 24:20.730]  Do you think that the sunshine and the natural, everything is going to help us prevent fucking up?
[24:21.370 --> 24:26.890]  Um, you know, it depends on your container. Uh, this one good thing about being in the ground,
[24:27.610 --> 24:37.210]  uh, it's a little more forgiving. I feel like, um, but, uh, you know, if you have a lot of water,
[24:37.210 --> 24:42.570]  um, you know, there's a lot of sunlight and a lot of photosynthesis is going on. So,
[24:42.570 --> 24:50.570]  um, you know, that's be, be careful. You know, don't just, you know, all right. Three times as
[24:50.570 --> 24:57.210]  much because the stone guy in the diary guy, uh, you know, please don't do that, but, you know,
[24:57.210 --> 25:03.450]  work into it. Um, but yeah, no, it's outdoor plan. She's a lot of nitrogen.
[25:03.450 --> 25:09.370]  Yeah. Instead of just flooding it one time, uh, flood it decently and then let it dry and then
[25:09.370 --> 25:12.330]  flood it again. And then like, but pay attention to it. Don't just try to go and
[25:12.970 --> 25:19.050]  super soak that bitch. Cause you'll drown it. She'll die for sure. That's there's, um,
[25:20.010 --> 25:25.370]  I think there's a difference between watering and feeding. Um, even though a lot of people consider
[25:25.370 --> 25:32.490]  that the same act as far as just dumping water on a plant. Um, when I feed a plant, um, I still
[25:32.490 --> 25:38.090]  water it first and then I apply the feed to it. Um, you know, same outdoors with the teas and
[25:38.090 --> 25:42.170]  everything like that. Uh, that's something that a lot of the new growers probably haven't ever
[25:42.170 --> 25:46.090]  even considered. Uh, instead of just, you can do this, this is indoor and outdoor.
[25:46.090 --> 25:50.970]  Uh, I feed my plants with nutrients every Monday. Uh, all of my plants, my mother plants,
[25:50.970 --> 25:54.970]  my veg plants, it's just Monday. It's, you know, it's the easy day to pick. You don't forget,
[25:55.610 --> 25:59.610]  uh, got it all figured out to get the Monday ritual, how you feed everything.
[25:59.610 --> 26:05.530]  I will, uh, I fill up two res's. I walk through and water each plant in the flowering room with
[26:05.530 --> 26:09.450]  a little bit of fresh water, just, just enough to get it, you know, awake, like give it a drink.
[26:09.450 --> 26:13.210]  And then I go hit the other rooms and then I come back and then I mix up the nutrients for each room
[26:13.210 --> 26:17.930]  and go back and get them. The first watering is just enough to kind of, kind of moisten the top
[26:17.930 --> 26:21.610]  soil. Like it doesn't go very deep, I don't think, but it kind of gives the plant a chance to wake
[26:21.610 --> 26:26.490]  up. It helps the nutrients flow through better. You know, that's my theory was, I don't always
[26:26.490 --> 26:31.850]  want to wake up and have a meal. I don't want to put, yeah, I don't want to start with a steak.
[26:31.850 --> 26:37.770]  I want to have some water and wet my throat up and get moving and wake up and then have some food
[26:37.770 --> 26:42.650]  and make some oatmeal or some whatever. Yeah. So let them wake up, let them enjoy the day.
[26:43.690 --> 26:47.610]  Uh, so I guess we should talk about feeding stuff. What are you putting in your tea right now?
[26:48.650 --> 26:56.170]  Um, I'm going heavy with kelp mill, um, alfalfa mill and the Mexican bat guano. Um,
[26:57.130 --> 27:03.850]  the tea I'm going to make tomorrow, actually, um, I'll, I'll make it tomorrow, apply it on Tuesday.
[27:03.850 --> 27:10.570]  Um, I'm going to put seabird guano in it for the first time. So start, I don't really have any
[27:10.570 --> 27:16.170]  exact theory on why I do that. No, no, I think the seabird guano, uh, they've been, the seabirds
[27:16.170 --> 27:20.410]  have been eating fish, which have been eating insects, which have been getting a lot of sunshine,
[27:21.130 --> 27:25.690]  which have been swimming in the ocean. So there's all just a lot of, and that's good shit. Literally,
[27:25.690 --> 27:30.010]  that's good shit. There's going to be a lot of that equals good flavor. Kyle Cushman will hate
[27:30.010 --> 27:36.090]  all that, that statement because Kyle goes with no shit, but no shit to each his own. No shit.
[27:37.450 --> 27:42.330]  And Jesse's weed. Yeah. All right. So are you putting molasses in there? Yeah. Yeah. Kelp meal,
[27:42.330 --> 27:48.970]  alfalfa meal, molasses, uh, Mike goes gray, white, Mike goes OGT, OGT shout out to that stuff. You
[27:48.970 --> 27:54.490]  get OGT at high growth Pueblo on fourth street. It's all my agriculture show sent you. Yeah.
[27:55.050 --> 27:58.570]  If you're lucky, you might catch me there. Maybe. Yeah. Sometimes Jesse's down there.
[27:58.570 --> 28:07.130]  Yeah. You know, some people, but yeah, no OGT, uh, um, oyster meal, I go heavy oyster meal. Uh,
[28:07.130 --> 28:12.010]  I don't put that in a T um, I'll top dress it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. For sure. As a Mike,
[28:13.850 --> 28:20.250]  I apply that to the soil. Um, okay. You know, that's, uh, and I said, as a Mike, sorry, my,
[28:20.250 --> 28:23.690]  my throat was clogged up. You guys are going to want to know what I said as a Mike is what it was.
[28:24.650 --> 28:29.130]  Um, and that's something I've never really, uh, messed around with appliances,
[28:29.130 --> 28:34.410]  teas or anything like that, or top dressing or anything like that. Okay. I put, I put it in
[28:34.410 --> 28:38.570]  initially in the soil. Yeah. Okay. And that's, I've usually seen it mixed in the super soil,
[28:38.570 --> 28:42.330]  but if I didn't get it in there, maybe I could try now is what I'm hoping for. Do you put any
[28:42.330 --> 28:47.050]  worm castings in your tea? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. All right. So you just got a five gallon bucket,
[28:47.050 --> 28:52.250]  basically probably larger for yourself. Um, but I could start if I wanted to just try some teas,
[28:52.250 --> 28:56.010]  I could do a five gallon bucket. If I'm a new listener, I could just do a five gallon bucket,
[28:56.010 --> 28:59.290]  put some water in there about three quarters of the way. Dechlorinated water,
[28:59.850 --> 29:05.530]  RO water. If you can, if you're making tea, you know, you got a, a little, uh, uh,
[29:05.530 --> 29:11.850]  aquarium pump. So, or air pumps. So, okay. So what we got to do, uh, about two days before you use
[29:11.850 --> 29:16.010]  this water, fill up your reservoir and put your air pump in there. Not your pump. Put the, the,
[29:16.170 --> 29:18.250]  the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[29:18.250 --> 29:22.490]  put your air stones in there. Yeah. Put your air stones in there. Keep the pump on a shelf,
[29:22.490 --> 29:26.330]  safe and dry. That's electric. Uh, put the air stones in there and just bubble the shit out of
[29:26.330 --> 29:30.410]  that water for as long as you can. And you want to get, you want to stir it a lot of times is
[29:30.410 --> 29:34.890]  what's happening essentially. Cause you're trying to bring all the, uh, chlorine and anything else.
[29:34.890 --> 29:38.570]  Uh, there's all kinds of shit in the Pueblo water. You want all that to evaporate out.
[29:39.530 --> 29:44.730]  So bubble it up a lot before you use it and then use that same water. Just leave the air stone in
[29:44.730 --> 29:51.290]  there. Right. Let it keep on bubbling. Pour in your molasses. Uh, if I got 15 mils per gallon,
[29:51.290 --> 29:57.930]  50 or 15, 15 a tablespoon. Okay. So, um, so about, uh,
[30:00.010 --> 30:06.410]  about two shot glasses worth for a five gallon bucket ish. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then, uh,
[30:06.410 --> 30:11.130]  don't fill it up all the way either. Uh, do like four gallons. Okay. A little headspace.
[30:11.210 --> 30:14.250]  We're going to, we're going to have some foam later. We're going to have a lot of foam later.
[30:15.050 --> 30:21.370]  Headspace. That's literally what he meant too. So we've got our T we've got a molasses in there.
[30:22.250 --> 30:29.290]  Uh, earthworm castings. Yeah. Um, I don't do exact measurements on that. Um, five gallon bucket. I do
[30:29.290 --> 30:35.210]  like nice little double handed handful. Okay. Like a kid grabbing a bunch of candy. Yeah. Yeah.
[30:35.210 --> 30:40.330]  Probably like eight cups. You can't really overdo the worm castings. They're just expensive. Yeah.
[30:40.410 --> 30:43.850]  Okay. So like two cups is what I think we're looking at three or four cups. Maybe the most
[30:43.850 --> 30:48.250]  there depends on how big your hands are. If you have homemade compost or you got a cool neighbor
[30:48.250 --> 30:54.250]  or something like that, that that'll work in lieu of the worm castings or together. So together,
[30:54.250 --> 30:58.250]  yeah. You get some warm poop. Oh man. You're golden. Put that worm tea in there. Yeah.
[30:58.890 --> 31:04.570]  All right. Uh, what else are we putting? Uh, we got the, the kelp, the kelp meal. Yeah. Um,
[31:04.650 --> 31:10.250]  I've been, I've been kind of starting to slow on that. Um, I've used it before, but I've never
[31:10.250 --> 31:15.290]  used it in teas and stuff. So read some stuff this winter and now I'm going nuts with it. Um,
[31:16.250 --> 31:24.170]  right now, let's see for five gallons to say, I probably do like a quarter cup. I'm sure you
[31:24.170 --> 31:32.250]  could probably go more. Um, I've never seen a good healthy tea burn a plant. So if you guys want to
[31:32.330 --> 31:36.810]  read a lot of these ideas, there's a book called, we talked about it in a few shows ago. Uh,
[31:37.450 --> 31:41.210]  the fuck is it called? It's called true living organics by the Rev. Check that out. I recommend
[31:41.210 --> 31:44.570]  that shout out to the Rev. They don't pay me to say that or anything. He just writes a book.
[31:44.570 --> 31:50.570]  That's exactly what we're talking about. So if, uh, if you want a lot of their step-by-step teas,
[31:50.570 --> 31:54.650]  their directions, how to make them, there are certain teas for certain phases. He's got teas
[31:54.650 --> 32:00.890]  for seedlings, veg plants, late veg plants, early flower. He's got a tea for every day of the week
[32:00.890 --> 32:07.930]  in there. Uh, they're pretty elaborate. Some of them don't be intimidated. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't
[32:07.930 --> 32:11.690]  they're very effective. Uh, those teas are the way to go. It looks like a lot of the Rev grows
[32:11.690 --> 32:17.130]  some gorgeous weed. I don't know that I've ever smoked any TLO weed. That's not what I do. Jesse
[32:17.130 --> 32:20.570]  shaking his head. Like, no, I haven't had the opportunity. Say, if you guys have some TLO
[32:20.570 --> 32:25.770]  weed and you're in Colorado, I'd just like to taste it. I've all shared some of my dabs or
[32:25.770 --> 32:32.650]  whatever. I saw a meme of myself, somebody made a Rasta Jeff meme, but yeah. Uh, it says grows
[32:32.650 --> 32:40.890]  veganic only smokes BHO. You taking a dab, but yeah, I'll share some dabs or if I happen to have
[32:40.890 --> 32:44.090]  a fresh crop of some lemon Jeff or whatever, we'll, uh, we'll get down to that. I just want
[32:44.090 --> 32:48.730]  to taste your TLO weed. I want to see if what the hype is about, you know, I'd like to come see your
[32:48.730 --> 32:53.930]  plants. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just nosy like that. You can come see mine. You can come see Jesse's.
[32:54.890 --> 32:57.050]  Yeah. Thanks for putting that out there for us.
[32:59.690 --> 33:05.290]  All right. Uh, man, earlier you said a drip line. Yeah. That's a brilliant idea for, uh,
[33:05.290 --> 33:09.770]  outdoors. You're going to want to water often. Uh, if you could set up a little miniature drip
[33:09.770 --> 33:14.010]  line, it's not that hard. You need a large rez to hold your water, a reservoir that is not going
[33:14.010 --> 33:17.370]  to get algae funked. It's got to be something designed to hold water. Don't be a cheapskate
[33:17.370 --> 33:23.290]  on this part. Yeah. You'll spend some time cleaning lines often. Yeah. You need a pump
[33:23.370 --> 33:28.490]  like, uh, I don't even remember how many gallons per hour pump, but it depends on how many plants
[33:28.490 --> 33:32.810]  and how many lines, but then you just need a splitter and then like octopus hose coming out
[33:32.810 --> 33:37.450]  of that. And one thing to each plant and a spike. And you just put that spike right in the dirt near
[33:37.450 --> 33:42.170]  the center of the plant and set a timer on the pump. And every, uh, however often you have it
[33:42.170 --> 33:48.170]  come on water will magically flow from your reservoir to your plants. So all you got to do is,
[33:48.810 --> 33:55.050]  uh, turn on that pump one time, hit a timer, see how long it takes for those plants to get an
[33:55.050 --> 33:59.610]  adequate amount of water and then hit stop when they're, when they're good. And then set your
[33:59.610 --> 34:04.170]  timer for that much time on every morning. So right. Whatever time you see the sun peak up,
[34:04.170 --> 34:08.250]  boom, seven o'clock, that timer should come on. Boom. Fucking water your plants for you right
[34:08.250 --> 34:15.130]  away. And if it never does build up to an adequate amount, you need more drip emitter heads per
[34:15.370 --> 34:22.170]  Just bigger tube everywhere. Yeah. More water delivery. And in a nutshell, I use a gravity
[34:22.170 --> 34:27.050]  system, but it's a little bit larger scale. So yeah, yeah. Yeah. You can always put your
[34:27.050 --> 34:32.570]  res at the top of the Hill and run your lines down the Hill basically, um, without a really fancy,
[34:32.570 --> 34:40.170]  a solenoid thing, um, to open and close the tank. You don't have a actual or too good a control over
[34:40.250 --> 34:46.250]  it. So just, just by the pump and, uh, you know, 55 gallon barrel or something like that.
[34:47.770 --> 34:51.610]  And then, uh, I mean, you can almost make sure T in that barrel.
[34:52.490 --> 34:58.330]  You can, um, that would be good for the, uh, pantyhose. Yeah. That's where we talked about.
[34:58.330 --> 35:03.530]  So throw all of the ingredients we talked about, uh, to put in our T into a thing, a pantyhose and
[35:03.530 --> 35:07.770]  just tie it into a knot so that you just made a giant tea bag and then just drop that inside there
[35:07.770 --> 35:11.130]  and let that bubble around in there. And you're going to get a bunch of foam up on top of your
[35:11.130 --> 35:14.810]  T. We didn't mention that we kind of did a little bit, but once you get all those ingredients in
[35:14.810 --> 35:18.410]  there, let it bubble, let it stew for about 24 hours. When you're making tea, we kind of skip
[35:18.410 --> 35:23.690]  that step, uh, put it, set it in a container. Uh, I've seen a lot of guys buy those little
[35:23.690 --> 35:29.130]  rubber made containers that a five gallon bucket will set right inside of the shit bubbles over,
[35:29.130 --> 35:32.330]  uh, the head. Jesse's looking at me like, Oh fuck. I've had to clean up so many messes.
[35:33.290 --> 35:38.810]  Yeah. Those little containers are sweet. I bought a stack of them one time. I love going to one.
[35:38.810 --> 35:43.530]  They, they have to know who grows weed at Walmart and all the stores. Cause we buy the most random
[35:43.530 --> 35:49.450]  shit in bulk. Like, no, I need, how many do I need? I need, I need 33 of them. Like really? Yes. 33
[35:49.450 --> 35:53.050]  of these. Cause it's only going to work if I have 33, they're the exact same or the whole room is
[35:53.050 --> 35:58.650]  going to look crooked. If I have one that's off like, yep. Do you guys have more box fans?
[35:58.730 --> 36:05.210]  I'm that guy. You got like three carts full of them on the top shelf and give me that other
[36:05.210 --> 36:09.050]  pallet of those fans, please. Yeah. That was me the other day. I need that silver one. That's,
[36:10.090 --> 36:14.090]  I forgot that I don't have a fan anymore. So sometimes I go to Lowe's and I'm like,
[36:14.090 --> 36:17.370]  Oh fuck. I want to buy like nine of these, but I can only fit three in the car.
[36:19.050 --> 36:23.770]  Get rid of my pervert van. All right. We talked about teas kind of randomly. Drip line would be
[36:23.770 --> 36:29.050]  a good idea to research that and be careful with it, but it's such a great idea if you can get it
[36:29.050 --> 36:35.850]  figured out and get it going. Yeah. If you've got a real job and you know, you got rocks in your,
[36:35.850 --> 36:40.810]  you know, you couldn't plan in the ground, even in ground, they're great. If you're having
[36:40.810 --> 36:49.770]  watering issues, you know, you can't water them enough drip line, you can get a real simple setup
[36:49.770 --> 36:57.370]  at Harbor freight, I believe for like less than 30 bucks. I want to say nice. So less than 30 bucks
[36:57.370 --> 37:04.730]  for a drip line. Yeah. That's why am I not doing that in all of my rooms? Um, I think hand feeding
[37:04.730 --> 37:11.210]  is personal. Yeah. I love them. I get to be all of my plants every day. I don't like mechanic
[37:11.210 --> 37:16.410]  mechanized rooms. I hate that term state of the art when it comes to marijuana growth. I feel
[37:16.410 --> 37:20.570]  state of the art is, uh, that just lets you know, you probably don't want anything to do with it.
[37:25.690 --> 37:31.770]  Here's a weird question. How do I adjust the pH of my tea or whatever without fucking up the micro
[37:31.770 --> 37:36.170]  life? Or do I even need to worry about it? I don't, you don't, you just think that all that
[37:36.170 --> 37:40.810]  stuff in there is going to do what it needs to do and be at the pH it needs to be at. Yeah.
[37:40.810 --> 37:46.170]  Otherwise you may destroy it, right? That's the theory I've got on, um, even putting things like,
[37:46.170 --> 37:52.730]  uh, stuff that's derived from Lennardite, um, putting that in your tea, you can just watch it,
[37:52.730 --> 37:58.890]  kill it like right in front of you on the foam and it just, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um,
[38:01.290 --> 38:09.770]  cause some cow mags, uh, yeah. So, okay. Um, liquids into your teas is a, uh, um,
[38:09.850 --> 38:14.330]  is a touchy area if you want your tea to stay alive. Yeah. That's, that's why you're mixing
[38:14.330 --> 38:21.050]  up a tea is to avoid that. One ingredient I can recommend is called seagreen. Um, it's great for
[38:21.050 --> 38:28.010]  teas. Uh, don't apply it. Uh, when you start the brew, apply it after you're done. When you're
[38:28.010 --> 38:32.730]  about to apply it to the plant. Sea green. Yeah. Uh, what is sea green? That sounds like some kelp
[38:32.890 --> 38:41.290]  shit. Um, yeah. Fish based kelp. Um, it's a pretty low in PK. Um, it's kind of like a concentrated
[38:41.290 --> 38:46.810]  tea in a bottle. So that's a good start. Yeah. Um, what's the Fox farm product that is a good
[38:46.810 --> 38:51.690]  tea starter. Do you know which one I'm talking about? Um, micro brew, I believe. Um, it's either,
[38:52.970 --> 38:58.250]  it's either big on it's fuck. I'm going to Google it. Yeah. I've actually used this stuff a couple
[38:58.250 --> 39:04.810]  of times. Um, it was pretty neat. I had some samples. So it's one of those original three
[39:04.810 --> 39:09.290]  that Fox farms put out. Remember when they first started there were three. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I think
[39:09.290 --> 39:15.130]  it's tiger. Oh, okay. Okay. Nevermind. And I'm thinking of something else. One of those original
[39:15.130 --> 39:19.530]  three and they've changed their website all up to, Hey, neat. One of those original three,
[39:20.170 --> 39:25.930]  I can't find it on here. Cause I'm trying to talk to was a great one for making a tea.
[39:25.930 --> 39:35.530]  I'm looking. Um, another, um, general hydroponics for this just plus is a pretty good for making
[39:35.530 --> 39:46.010]  some teas. It is the, Oh God. I'm choking too. It's the big bloom. I think really
[39:46.970 --> 39:57.050]  I'll have to check that out. It could be taught. It's one of these three, the tiger bloom grow
[39:57.050 --> 40:00.650]  bigger, big bloom. The rev recommends it in his book heavily. Sorry guys. I didn't mean to rant
[40:00.650 --> 40:03.370]  on that for no reason. Cause I couldn't even find the correct answer. Now I feel silly.
[40:05.530 --> 40:09.450]  That's a good base for a T you can add that one to the T and feel safe, but yeah, read what you're
[40:09.450 --> 40:12.810]  putting in there. Yeah. I'll get the revs book. Look for the revs book. I'll let you borrow it.
[40:12.810 --> 40:17.530]  Come on over. You can use it teaming with microbes. Yeah. Oh, that's a good one too.
[40:17.530 --> 40:21.050]  Teaming with microbes. Hey Sean, do you listen to the show? What's up, man? I hope you listen.
[40:21.690 --> 40:24.890]  King Cola. I hope you listen, bro. I haven't talked to you in a while, but you would appreciate
[40:24.890 --> 40:29.130]  this. You can chime in on this topic. Come teach us about tea one time, bro. You're,
[40:29.130 --> 40:34.810]  you're invited. Just message me. You know how to find all the scientific stuff. He knows. Yeah.
[40:34.810 --> 40:38.570]  Yeah. Let him do a whole talk about teas and organics. I'm the hippie and I'm like,
[40:39.050 --> 40:46.250]  do this. It works. I've got that. I know a lot, but I've also got that Soma vibe to where I just,
[40:46.250 --> 40:50.570]  I can look at the plant and that's like your dog. When your dog walks up to you, you're like,
[40:50.570 --> 40:55.610]  Oh, that dog's either hungry, has to shit, wants to go outside or lost its ball. Yeah. And I could
[40:55.610 --> 41:00.250]  tell that about my plants too. It either needs water. It's too hot in here. It needs to get fed
[41:00.250 --> 41:04.810]  or it's time to harvest. You know, you can tell just by looking. Yeah. Kind of like a baby.
[41:05.770 --> 41:11.770]  They're my children. So I've heard they're my babies. So we've got good soil. We've got good
[41:11.770 --> 41:18.170]  teas, uh, big pots for bigger plants. We'll talk about a drip line. That sounds like a good
[41:18.170 --> 41:23.370]  project to work on. Got about 25 days, 30 days from now until we're going to go into flower.
[41:24.250 --> 41:27.450]  So we can top them. We could train them a little bit, right? If we want to get out there and play
[41:27.530 --> 41:33.530]  with the plants. For sure. I've topped a three or three, uh, three or four times, five times,
[41:33.530 --> 41:39.450]  six times different plants. Yeah. So you've got some dragon headed plants now, like 90 heads
[41:39.450 --> 41:44.010]  coming off of them. My personal plants were a little behind this year, um, cause of work
[41:44.010 --> 41:51.450]  obligations. But, um, you know, the little tiny guys with like, like Jeff said, dragon heads. So
[41:51.530 --> 41:57.610]  hydras. Yeah. Hydras. I'm experimenting with, uh, uh, low stress training this year,
[41:58.730 --> 42:03.290]  some bamboo and soft tie. Just kind of pulling them down a little bit. So grab some of the
[42:03.290 --> 42:07.770]  tops of the plants and just bend them down so that we can get a little more light to spaces
[42:07.770 --> 42:12.330]  and give them, give the heads a little more space to breathe. Right. Give them airflow guys. Don't
[42:12.330 --> 42:16.490]  try to trap your four plants. Like Jesse said, Nick, few episodes ago, don't try to trap them
[42:16.490 --> 42:20.810]  between the shed, the house and the garage and the fence. Give them plenty of air. Or you're
[42:20.810 --> 42:24.330]  going to end up with moldy buds and the plants know when they're crowded, they can feel it. The
[42:24.330 --> 42:27.450]  roots, uh, the roots grow. If you got them in the dirt, the roots will touch each other and
[42:27.450 --> 42:30.650]  they'll be like, Oh, there's another plant here. And they won't grow into that plant.
[42:32.250 --> 42:36.810]  Or maybe it will, maybe it'll choke the other one out. I read on an old, uh, on a pot forum,
[42:36.810 --> 42:43.690]  uh, something Tom Hill wrote years ago about how the plant will never grow wider than it's
[42:44.250 --> 42:49.210]  in the mass of its root structure. Right. So experimented with that a little bit last year
[42:49.210 --> 42:55.930]  and noticed quite a bit of, um, difference. And needless to say, my, my holes this year were
[42:55.930 --> 43:01.530]  a lot bigger in circumference than they had been in previous years. Okay. That's, um, I've been
[43:01.530 --> 43:05.530]  telling my buddy Tony kind of the same thing. He likes the, when he looks in a grow room or looks
[43:05.530 --> 43:09.850]  on pictures online, when he sees just a bunch of tall, skinny plants. So he's asking me how to do
[43:09.850 --> 43:13.290]  that. And I was like, just keep them in small, small containers. And that way for sure. I told
[43:13.290 --> 43:16.650]  him essentially the same thing. I was like, if you're wide, you got to branch out a little more.
[43:16.650 --> 43:20.730]  You got to spread your legs. If you're tall, you can just stand real feet together. Yeah,
[43:20.730 --> 43:26.010]  for sure. Same idea. Awesome. Cool. So, uh, what do we need to look for? We can have any problems
[43:26.010 --> 43:31.050]  right about now or anything coming up? What's to, and fucking animals that have been deer and skunk
[43:31.050 --> 43:36.730]  and everything all over town lately. What the hell? I actually, uh, buddy of a buddy, I heard
[43:36.730 --> 43:44.570]  about a bear incident and a bag of blood mill. So he's lived in bear country his whole life.
[43:44.650 --> 43:52.330]  He should know better. Man. Um, um, you know, how do you, uh, the only thing to keep a bear
[43:52.330 --> 43:59.290]  out of your garden is fucking nothing. Pretty much. There's no, I don't mace bear spray,
[43:59.290 --> 44:05.290]  but you don't want to spray that in your crop. So, um, it's been, you know, here locally in
[44:05.290 --> 44:10.170]  Southern Colorado, it's been real humid lately. Uh, lots of rain this year, which is a good thing.
[44:10.170 --> 44:16.330]  Um, fuck. I think this is the first day we've hit a hundred degrees all summer. Yeah. I mean,
[44:16.330 --> 44:21.450]  yeah. And the plants are noticing it too. I very much noticed it. Fucking hate that.
[44:23.210 --> 44:26.810]  I got this big mop on my head. It's like, we're in an Afghan all day. Yeah. That's like,
[44:26.810 --> 44:32.650]  I got one on my chin. So not quite as dense as yours, but still in the face, man. Oh,
[44:32.650 --> 44:38.810]  that drives me nuts. So the humidity is going to be an issue. You know, potentially could be,
[44:39.050 --> 44:44.730]  I, I haven't had any issues. I didn't want to sound like a dick when I said that or anything,
[44:44.730 --> 44:49.210]  but we just put a fan outside. Like, is that fucking feasible? Is that ridiculous? I mean,
[44:49.210 --> 44:54.970]  no, no, not at all. I just, I don't hesitate to do it at all. So yeah. Go to Lowe's and be that
[44:54.970 --> 44:59.210]  guy buying four fans and put one in each corner of your garden. Fuck. Yeah. And don't, don't sync
[44:59.210 --> 45:02.890]  them up. Don't make them all look like a concerto when they're turning all at the same time. You
[45:02.890 --> 45:06.650]  don't want to synchronize, make them all go at random. If you can put two at different speeds
[45:06.650 --> 45:10.170]  and make them turn all different times. It's what you want. You want to stir the air. You
[45:10.170 --> 45:15.050]  don't want to just move it around. You want to stir it when it's moist around here. Um,
[45:15.050 --> 45:21.850]  last year I had a hard time. Uh, um, there was a real good brainy season last year too. It seemed
[45:21.850 --> 45:27.850]  like, um, and I had a hard time getting the soil to dry out so I could get teased to it and stuff.
[45:27.850 --> 45:35.290]  Um, so, you know, if that's an issue you're having, I used fans, however, um, I should have
[45:35.290 --> 45:42.570]  just top dressed, but, um, you know, do both. I could see that as a potential issue. So yeah.
[45:46.330 --> 45:52.170]  Yeah. Spider mites, I suppose. Um, yeah, this is a good time of year for spider mites. If you go to
[45:52.170 --> 45:56.890]  the hydro shop, if you go to the dispensary, wherever your clones came from, we talked about
[45:56.890 --> 46:03.850]  that in a pop up in, in people's indoor gardens around here. So I'm sure, you know, depending on
[46:03.930 --> 46:07.450]  where your plants came from, treat your plants with neem oil guys. You got plenty of time. If
[46:07.450 --> 46:13.530]  you're outdoors, spider, I've always thought spider mites were like extraordinarily easy to,
[46:13.530 --> 46:19.890]  to, uh, to beat outdoors. So just religiously spray neem oil. Um,
[46:22.090 --> 46:27.690]  there's a product called Kapow. Um, it's just like essential oils and stuff like that. Um,
[46:28.650 --> 46:34.490]  some of the Sierra natural science products probably worked real great. Yeah. A lot of
[46:34.490 --> 46:40.010]  those CNS products are great. That's what I use a lot of their stuff. Um, the mighty wash,
[46:40.010 --> 46:43.690]  you know, that's just DNI, DI and ice water. They changed the name of that. It's not called
[46:43.690 --> 46:47.610]  mighty wash anymore. They didn't want the word in there. I forget the new name, but it's not
[46:47.610 --> 46:54.090]  mighty wash anymore. I liked it. Cause you knew what it was for, right? The bottle still fricking
[46:54.890 --> 46:59.930]  bubbles. I've heard things, good things about liquid lady bugs, but, uh, never had to use it.
[47:01.050 --> 47:06.090]  How about just some lady bugs or some praying mantis or some predatory mites praying madness?
[47:06.090 --> 47:11.690]  I've had them hang around plants for a whole season. Um, it's pretty cool. Um,
[47:12.570 --> 47:18.170]  lady bugs. Um, it's a great picture off outside. So there's no real way to contain them. Yeah.
[47:18.170 --> 47:23.050]  They say like to leave unless you got some way to engage. I've always found them. If you use them in
[47:23.050 --> 47:28.650]  your grow room, it's just basically fodder for your fans and something to sweep up later. Yeah.
[47:28.650 --> 47:32.810]  Yeah. Poor little guys. You find them in your, your sealed lights trying to figure out,
[47:33.450 --> 47:39.930]  they can't get out of here, man. All right. So, um, shit dude, that sounds like a good outdoor
[47:39.930 --> 47:43.610]  girl lesson. We'll write about 30 minutes. Sweet. Uh, how long until you think you need
[47:43.610 --> 47:50.410]  to come back and give us a heads up on what's going on? Um, a couple more weeks. I don't know.
[47:51.370 --> 47:55.450]  We'll just kind of see how it goes. We get 25 days still flowering. So maybe we'll come back
[47:55.450 --> 48:00.090]  maybe right at the start or maybe a little bit in and see what's going on. So yeah, for sure. Cool.
[48:00.090 --> 48:05.450]  Cool. Um, yeah. The people really like having you on dude. They really do. The people, the listeners
[48:05.450 --> 48:09.450]  really, most of my comments are about outdoor girl lessons. So like what's next, what's next?
[48:10.570 --> 48:14.730]  I haven't checked them out. I tried to on Stitcher. So screw you Stitcher.
[48:16.090 --> 48:19.370]  I love you. Just screw the comment section. Yeah. I love Stitcher too.
[48:19.370 --> 48:23.130]  Now that I found the place to go for the comments, it's really an obscure place. It has nothing to do
[48:23.130 --> 48:26.810]  with the rest of my episodes. You have to go to a certain little tab to even find it. But once you
[48:26.810 --> 48:31.050]  get there, then they're all there. It's kind of weird. And if you leave it on an episode previous,
[48:31.050 --> 48:36.090]  and I don't look at that episode, I won't see the comment. So leave them on either the main page.
[48:36.090 --> 48:41.290]  If you can find it or on episode 13 is where I check for comments. It just makes it easy.
[48:41.290 --> 48:44.810]  It's old school. So thanks for coming. Seriously. Yeah. No, thanks for having me. We'll have you
[48:44.810 --> 48:48.170]  back. What's really great having you help out a lot of people. There are a lot of people. This
[48:48.170 --> 48:52.250]  dude brought me some organic cherries. I can't wait to put those in something. I'm not sure what
[48:52.250 --> 48:56.010]  I have, but why am I just make a salad and pour a little dressing on there and try those books?
[48:56.010 --> 49:05.370]  Yeah. Yeah. I use them. I don't know the sign to, you know, the official word for it, but you know,
[49:05.370 --> 49:12.810]  I'll cook them down and a reduction reduction. I kept wanting to say a gelatin for some reason,
[49:13.370 --> 49:18.730]  um, but, uh, I'm a meat eater, so, but, but I eat really good meat. So like,
[49:18.730 --> 49:25.370]  Oh, you know, homegrown chicken just all soaked in that stuff. It's just fantastic.
[49:25.370 --> 49:31.290]  Sounds like some ladies would love you wrapped in bacon, wrapped in bacon. That's the American way.
[49:31.290 --> 49:38.570]  Okay. I haven't eaten bacon in probably close to 15 years. Damn. Yeah. I haven't had any meat
[49:38.570 --> 49:46.010]  at all in probably 15, somewhere between 12 and 17 issues. Props on that. Yeah. Thanks. I guess.
[49:47.210 --> 49:50.810]  I don't know if I was bragging or not. Maybe that was a humble brag. Well, yeah, something to be
[49:50.810 --> 49:55.130]  proud of. Cool. Oh man. Thanks for coming. Uh, I know you got a busy night. We're going to take a
[49:55.130 --> 49:58.250]  couple more dabs and let Jesse get out of here. This dude's getting married, everybody. So
[49:58.250 --> 50:04.570]  congratulate him. That's cheers. I'm clapping my hands. Congratulations. Expensive. But it'll last
[50:04.570 --> 50:09.050]  forever. I met your wife finally. Here's your fiance. She's pretty cool. Go visit her down at
[50:09.050 --> 50:14.170]  Hygro Pueblo. All right, guys, we're going to take some dabs. I'll be back to wrap up the show.
[50:14.170 --> 50:16.890]  Thanks for joining us. We'll see you soon. For sure. See you guys.
[50:18.890 --> 50:23.370]  All right, guys, that wraps up another grow lesson and another episode of the Hygro Culture Podcast.
[50:23.370 --> 50:27.210]  I want to thank you for listening. I want to thank Jesse for coming out, doing a lesson with us.
[50:28.410 --> 50:34.090]  The next episode I will be recording live from the Brickyard in Pueblo. The Brickyard is currently
[50:34.170 --> 50:40.650]  a hookah bar. We're trying to get the city council to help us change legislation so that we can make
[50:40.650 --> 50:47.930]  this building a dab lounge. We'll be talking more about that on the next episode. I plan to have
[50:47.930 --> 50:52.970]  members of the Citizens for the Responsible Regulation of Cannabis on the next episode.
[50:53.610 --> 50:58.170]  They're the group that is working with city council to get the recreational smoking areas
[50:58.170 --> 51:03.370]  open here in city limits. They were kind enough to open, to let us open them in the county, but
[51:03.850 --> 51:08.650]  we want it in city limits. A lot of us live in the city. We don't feel that the county
[51:08.650 --> 51:12.330]  should have all the cool stuff. So listen to that episode when it comes out.
[51:13.370 --> 51:17.370]  Now that the show's over, please go to iTunes. Go to the iTunes store, search for Hygro Culture,
[51:17.370 --> 51:21.370]  find the review section, give us a five-star rating. After that, type in a comment and let
[51:21.370 --> 51:25.210]  me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comments on an upcoming episode.
[51:26.010 --> 51:30.970]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, Swell.am. I always fuck that one up,
[51:31.370 --> 51:36.970]  Swell.am. And also, all of the episodes are available, available. I've been at this for a
[51:36.970 --> 51:42.490]  minute. All those dabs are kicking in. All those episodes are available on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[51:43.850 --> 51:48.010]  All right, we're going to end this episode with a song from Task Rock. This one is called Woody
[51:48.010 --> 51:53.770]  Brown. Check it out. Big shout out to Task. Shout out to my ninja Spence. Thanks again to
[51:53.770 --> 51:58.570]  Jesse for coming. Thanks to you guys for listening. Take a fat dab. Give your mom a hug for me.
[52:00.970 --> 52:07.530]  Can we get the spotlight on, please? Thank you.
[52:30.970 --> 52:50.330]  Yeah, man. How's it going? It's nice to meet you.
[53:01.130 --> 53:05.850]  And I'll be sounding like a Wookiee sounds. Yo, we're moving on up and never looking back.
[53:05.850 --> 53:10.330]  Take a look around. We're never looking down. Cause it ain't where you're from, yo. It's where
[53:10.330 --> 53:14.890]  you're at. And where we're at is pretty far from the ground. I'm feeling high and I don't think
[53:14.890 --> 53:20.330]  it's just the medication. Chilling in my own spot like a reservation. Getting lost even further
[53:20.330 --> 53:25.610]  from my destination. I wish I would have paid attention to my education. Free spirit. Never
[53:25.610 --> 53:30.570]  had a carrot at all. Always going to beat myself up no matter where I fall. Throwing up like
[53:30.570 --> 53:36.810]  aerosol seals cause I still feel ill from the merino pills. Just kidding, man. I ain't taking
[53:36.810 --> 53:42.650]  no's. I'm taking I. Fuck it. You all know the way it goes. Seriously, I don't have to tell y'all
[53:42.650 --> 53:50.490]  anymore. I'm feeling half baked. Not fully there, but still trying to get ahead like pulling hair.
[53:50.490 --> 53:54.890]  If push comes to shove, well, I guess it's only fair. Fuck the top, man. I heard it's kind of
[53:54.890 --> 53:59.690]  lonely there. It's been a good year. One that I won't forget. It started with a broken heart,
[53:59.770 --> 54:04.090]  but then some goals were met. I met a lot of golden people who've shown respect, made a few
[54:04.090 --> 54:08.810]  mistakes, but I'm great. Thanks. No regrets. Push along. Put your shoulder to the wheel, man. The
[54:08.810 --> 54:14.010]  realest that I've rapped and the oldest that I've filled. No longer am I going for the kill. Now,
[54:14.010 --> 54:19.130]  I'm more like the soldier that's holstering his spill. I guess the battle's done and the war is
[54:19.130 --> 54:25.290]  won. But stay tuned, man, cause surely y'all, there's more to come. Don't play me out, stuff.
[54:25.850 --> 54:31.850]  I'm an exit. Stage left. Turn this spotlight off, please.
[54:31.850 --> 54:47.850]  Cut the secret code. Cut, cut, cut the secret code. Cut, cut, here's the code. Cut, cut the secret code.
[54:48.090 --> 54:58.170]  Here we are born to be kings. Welcome to the cut. I'm so glad that you made it from LA to NY. We
[54:58.170 --> 55:03.770]  all getting faded all across the nation. Tell me who got the best, the top shelf extracts. I won't
[55:03.770 --> 55:08.730]  settle for the rest. No, it's gotta be that proper. Give me highest helicopters. Chest thumping like
[55:08.730 --> 55:13.850]  a chaperone. Like I need a doctor talking slow, like a mobster leaning low in my chair. Thinking
[55:13.850 --> 55:19.130]  what should I hit next? Could you high off the air? Dabbing with the judges extract extraordinaire.
[55:19.130 --> 55:24.170]  The only tangy to the TI turps got them well aware. Highly educated, top notch,
[55:24.170 --> 55:29.130]  dabbing there. You damn right we faded, but I still hit it. I ain't scared. Call me Mr. Dab-a-lina,
[55:29.130 --> 55:35.130]  Mr. Glide Dab-a-lina. The 91 ISO got the rig looking cleaner. Dab bar, do it big. Where's
[55:35.130 --> 55:39.210]  my number? Have you seen it? That's the game of the event and most will never find it neither.
[55:39.690 --> 55:44.490]  Welcome to the cup. Welcome to the cup. Welcome to the cup. Rounding towards the bar.
[55:45.690 --> 55:49.930]  Yeah. Happy 4th of July weekend, everybody. I hope you're all shaking off your hangovers
[55:49.930 --> 55:54.010]  and trying to glue on the fingers you blew off. Welcome to another episode of the I Grow Culture

[58:00.010 --> 58:06.730]  the live show. Here we go. Yeah, what's up, guys? We are coming to you live from the Brickyard
[58:06.730 --> 58:11.290]  Hookah Bar in Pueblo, Colorado. The Brickyard is actually a hookah bar right now. We're trying to
[58:11.290 --> 58:16.570]  get city council to give us the ordinance to turn this place into a social cannabis club,
[58:16.570 --> 58:22.650]  but so far the city has been hesitant to do that. So what we've decided to do tonight is have a live
[58:22.650 --> 58:26.890]  podcast from here. I brought several of my friends. Misty brought several of her friends.
[58:27.850 --> 58:32.490]  I am a member of a committee called the Citizens for the Responsible Regulation of Cannabis. We've
[58:32.490 --> 58:36.410]  got four members here. They're going to talk with us. I'm one of those members. Misty's a member.
[58:36.410 --> 58:39.770]  My friend Lee is here. You want to say hi, bro? Hi, guys.
[58:39.770 --> 58:42.730]  Gary's over here. Say hi, Gary. Hey. Glad to be back.
[58:43.530 --> 58:48.890]  I guess what we should start with, do you have any idea, Misty, why they won't let you turn this
[58:49.210 --> 58:53.690]  into a dab bar, a social cannabis club? Sorry, I'm going to try not to say dab bar. That sounds
[58:53.690 --> 58:59.050]  not classy. Do you have any idea why they won't let you do that? No, I'm not. Well, first, I want
[58:59.050 --> 59:05.050]  to say thanks for coming in and doing your live show here. I am so in debt to you for bringing
[59:05.050 --> 59:10.170]  this out in the open for sure. And when it comes to the city, I'm not sure. There's not an ordinance
[59:10.170 --> 59:17.450]  in place. I'm not selling marijuana. I am simply giving people a place to come and socialize,
[59:17.450 --> 59:24.970]  play pool, throw darts, listen to music, watch a great standup comic that I would like to bring in,
[59:24.970 --> 59:31.610]  you know, just come and enjoy themselves without having an alcohol-based atmosphere. And that's
[59:31.610 --> 59:36.250]  what this is, is a social club, the same as we do with our local bars. That was part of what I was
[59:36.250 --> 59:40.170]  heading for. I invited a bunch of my friends. You invited several of your friends. There are people
[59:40.170 --> 59:44.330]  here that have never met each other. We've been smoking a little bit of cannabis here. Does anybody
[59:44.330 --> 59:49.850]  here feel unsafe? No. There's a bunch of no's from the crowd. There are six, eight, 10 people here
[59:49.850 --> 59:54.570]  that all yelled no. Hell no. There's a hell no from somebody else. Yeah. So do you guys all feel
[59:54.570 --> 59:59.050]  like we could all be friends and be adults here and do this responsibly? Yes. And if you saw
[59:59.050 --> 01:00:03.130]  somebody here fucking up, would you feel free to call them out and keep this place safe for us?
[01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:07.050]  Absolutely. As a community, that's what we do, right? We can govern ourselves because we're all
[01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:10.970]  adults. Awesome. See, nobody should be... There's a bunch of people here that are all... I'm going
[01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:14.730]  to say everyone's 21 or up. They're probably... I don't want to guess how old people are, but
[01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:19.370]  there's a nice age range here and everybody's friendly. We're all having fun. There's nothing
[01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:24.570]  going to happen here. The only thing I am worried about, my biggest fear, is police interaction.
[01:00:25.530 --> 01:00:29.770]  I am as well. I'm nervous about that a little bit. I am. That is the only thing I'm worried about.
[01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:36.250]  But I don't want to be the one breaking the law. I've been to city council and I'm trying to say,
[01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:42.410]  listen, they're coming in there to our city and they're buying marijuana and they're going and
[01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:48.010]  sitting in our parks. They're driving our streets. They're parking in the CODISACs. Why not just give
[01:00:48.010 --> 01:00:54.410]  them some place to come to, sit down, enjoy some company of some people maybe they don't know,
[01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:59.530]  maybe they do know, just to play a game of pool, play something great on the jukebox that they've
[01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:04.650]  been waiting to hear. I mean, it doesn't matter. This is a social atmosphere. And why are they
[01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:10.010]  stopping us from having this kind of atmosphere? Yeah, I agree completely. We need this as a
[01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:13.930]  community. We do. There are people that buy cannabis. There are dispensaries every direction
[01:01:14.810 --> 01:01:18.410]  10 minutes from here. You can get to a dispensary, but there is nowhere to smoke it.
[01:01:18.410 --> 01:01:23.770]  Exactly. I've got friends that run, work, manage. They all have dispensaries. And they say a lot of
[01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:30.010]  their recreational customers are actually coming from Texas. So those people have nowhere to smoke
[01:01:30.010 --> 01:01:34.410]  it. You can try to smoke it in your hotel, but if you're only here for a day, people are shaking
[01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:38.970]  their heads like, no, can't smoke in the hotel. Did you have experience? You want to come grab a
[01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:42.890]  mic for a second? I'll let you talk on a mic. This is my buddy, Adam. He's from out of state. He's
[01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:45.930]  been on the show once or twice. We kind of just derailed the structure of the show, but fuck it,
[01:01:45.930 --> 01:01:49.690]  it's going well. Yeah, we came from out of state. And that was one of the main things we were worried
[01:01:49.690 --> 01:01:56.650]  about is finding a 420 friendly hotel. We did have to look on Craigslist and actually find one. And
[01:01:56.650 --> 01:02:01.850]  then once we found one, it definitely wasn't the one that I wanted the kids to stay in. So you're
[01:02:01.850 --> 01:02:06.490]  talking about feeling safe and having a place to use cannabis safely. The only hotel in town that
[01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:12.250]  was safe to use cannabis is not exactly the place where I wanted to bring me, my wife, or my family.
[01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:15.210]  So it wasn't safe in the first place. They just didn't give a shit what you were doing. That
[01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:18.090]  makes sense. Dude, thanks for being on the show all the time. Thanks for coming out tonight. I
[01:02:18.090 --> 01:02:22.250]  appreciate that. We'll have you on more. So yeah, that's what we're trying to do. People are driving
[01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.610]  around there, like she said, hanging out at the park, which is not cool. That's where we take our
[01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:29.210]  children. And I know the park is a cool place to go smoke weed, but that's where I want to be able
[01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:32.810]  to take my daughter. I don't want to be hanging out with her, throwing a Frisbee and her having
[01:02:32.810 --> 01:02:36.650]  to watch you take a dab in the car. Well, and you're right. The great thing is that
[01:02:37.290 --> 01:02:42.250]  if you wanted to take the kids down to the park that's not too far from here, you can let them
[01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:48.010]  do their swimming thing and come up and enjoy the adult activities a distance away. I mean,
[01:02:48.010 --> 01:02:52.250]  this is a community thing and marijuana shouldn't be something that we should definitely fear.
[01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:57.610]  I have a lot of my customers that come in to have a drink next door when their kids at soccer
[01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:01.690]  practice. There's nothing wrong with that. You just mentioned the drink next door. You do run
[01:03:01.690 --> 01:03:06.330]  Legends, the bar next door. Yes, I do. Do you think that's going to affect city council's decision in
[01:03:06.330 --> 01:03:11.610]  letting you open this as a smoking establishment? Well, I hope not. I hope that they don't judge me
[01:03:11.610 --> 01:03:19.690]  on my performance in either place. I mean, I've ran a great bar for four years and I don't hope
[01:03:19.690 --> 01:03:25.210]  that they don't have a problem with that. I don't know how I feel about that. I should mention that
[01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:29.050]  I really appreciate you said you appreciate me coming. Thanks for letting me have all my friends
[01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:33.130]  here come take dabs. My friends are making new friends. You guys, one of you guys trade places
[01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:37.690]  on one of those couches so that my group and your group are mingling. We should do this again. I
[01:03:37.690 --> 01:03:42.890]  think that this is a great thing for the Brickyard for sure. That's a great. We'll get more people
[01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:47.610]  here next time too. No doubt. We'll announce the next date really soon on the show. I kept this
[01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:51.130]  one kind of secretive. I didn't know what to expect. I didn't want to fill the place and then
[01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:55.850]  have an issue. So it's going well so far. Absolutely. And you know, we're going to fill
[01:03:55.850 --> 01:04:00.410]  the place over this next month because we've got that thing that we're doing with the education on
[01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:05.210]  the 27th. Yeah. So let's talk a little bit about that. We are the committee for the responsible
[01:04:05.210 --> 01:04:11.130]  regulation of cannabis on seven 27. We're hosting. What did we decide to call it a seminar? Right?
[01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:16.650]  Yeah. Yeah. This is lead. It's speaking. Introduce yourself, my friend. Tell us what you do, who you
[01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:27.850]  are. For now, we can just call me Lee and I'm a local business person. I run a couple of businesses
[01:04:27.850 --> 01:04:36.890]  here in Pueblo and I want to make my first appearance about a couple of messages that I have.
[01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:49.130]  And the first one is that Pueblo has an opportunity to steer its future and its revenue
[01:04:49.930 --> 01:04:58.970]  through the industry. And it's up to citizens to take that opportunity and responsibility.
[01:04:58.970 --> 01:05:06.730]  Misty, it looks like she needs to speak to you. Grow it into a future for the city.
[01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:18.650]  And the second message is. It's not all about the dispensary model. There are all kinds of
[01:05:19.450 --> 01:05:30.650]  satellite companies and industries that go along with marijuana that should be developed and
[01:05:31.850 --> 01:05:39.370]  long term industry brought to the area. I'm going to have to take a break and take a drink.
[01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.010]  Go for it. We'll let Gary talk for a moment. You have anything to add to that one, Gary,
[01:05:42.010 --> 01:05:46.010]  as part of the committee for the responsible regulation of cannabis?
[01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:53.610]  Uh, yeah, I do actually. Um, with Misty's situation, they're telling her that she needs
[01:05:53.610 --> 01:05:58.810]  a permit that doesn't exist, so she can't open till she has the permit, but the permit doesn't
[01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:05.210]  exist. So my feeling on it, that that's completely illegal. It's certainly, you know, not in the
[01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:11.050]  spirit of city government, right? It's, it's ridiculous. But, you know, the rules governing
[01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:14.650]  private clubs are pretty specific, you know, and there are a couple here already,
[01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:22.730]  like the VFW and the American Legion. And those places are private clubs. They allow smoking of
[01:06:22.730 --> 01:06:27.930]  cigarettes and things like that, that you normally couldn't do in a regular bar, but they do it every
[01:06:27.930 --> 01:06:32.970]  day. And not to mention that those are great clubs and they are very well maintained and they are
[01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:38.090]  very organized and they're recognized. Oh, we've got the, you've got the hook of our license. You
[01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:42.010]  can smoke in here. Well, and there's never been any issues with any of those places, even though
[01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:47.210]  they're outside the norm. You see what I mean? There's really no grounds for them to say that
[01:06:47.210 --> 01:06:52.730]  this can't happen. We can comply with the Clean Air Act, right? Right. I mean, so what, there's
[01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:57.210]  no basis for it, except that they won't write a regulation and issue a permit. I should mention
[01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:03.290]  that they did just allow shops or not shops, but businesses for you to open and medicate or
[01:07:03.290 --> 01:07:07.130]  recreate in the county with that outside of city limits, but right inside of our county.
[01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:11.530]  I know that hurt me. That's a little bit of a slap in the face, isn't it? It hurt. It did. It was,
[01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:16.170]  um, I just kind of feel like, you know, people now are going to see the potential, but not that
[01:07:16.170 --> 01:07:20.810]  I'm knocking anyone who wants to open a cannabis club. That's a social club for people to go to.
[01:07:20.810 --> 01:07:26.170]  Cause I think that there is a need for it and all of our communities. Yeah. Um, but yeah,
[01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:31.050]  I was a little disappointed. I'd been open for a month and a half, two months as a hookah bar,
[01:07:31.050 --> 01:07:36.570]  because I'm afraid to get in trouble. I'm afraid to break the rules. I want to do everything right,
[01:07:36.730 --> 01:07:41.370]  right. Right. So you are closed right now. There's a security guard outside the door
[01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:44.810]  pacing back and forth. You just checked two of my friends IDs that came in.
[01:07:44.810 --> 01:07:50.330]  Yeah. So you have to be part of this to be able to get in. Yeah. Yeah. Um, and I don't know to
[01:07:50.330 --> 01:07:57.450]  be able to do this. Um, speaking of rules, uh, one of the basic rallying cries that everybody
[01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:04.970]  can understand is that we want to be regulated in the same way that alcohol is, uh, we want the same
[01:08:04.970 --> 01:08:12.490]  kind of oversight. We want the same kind of regular, excuse me, regulations. Uh, we're all
[01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:20.970]  about public safety. Um, we just want common sense people, uh, making the rules instead of people
[01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:27.930]  that have nothing to do with the industry. And that's what the C R R C, uh, is trying to do right
[01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:32.090]  now. That's why I'm part of it. I try to be, uh, the young influence. That's the dabber. That's
[01:08:32.090 --> 01:08:36.890]  the smoker. That's the grower. I try to bring that to the table. Absolutely. And that, you know,
[01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:41.130]  that's, what's great. We have a great diversity between all of us. I'm in where we're kind of at
[01:08:41.130 --> 01:08:47.850]  in the whole movement. And this is a movement that I think that is necessary in our society.
[01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:54.330]  What we've seen with, um, Pueblo and the city council and their moratorium is that first of all,
[01:08:54.330 --> 01:09:00.970]  the dispensary sprung up on the outside of town, right? So what Pueblo is experiencing and now
[01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:04.970]  they've allowed smoking clubs. So they will spring up. So what Pueblo is experiencing as a
[01:09:04.970 --> 01:09:12.010]  city is all of the ill effects that that brings with none of the benefits to offset it. They don't
[01:09:12.010 --> 01:09:16.730]  have any regulatory control because they're not in the city. They don't receive any tax revenue at
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:22.970]  all, but they're still getting smokers staying here, smokers in the park, smokers coming through
[01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:29.530]  our city. They're leaving because you know, what's great is as 30 miles North of me, you can go and
[01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:34.250]  you can smoke. You just can't buy marijuana. So basically they're stopping here and they're
[01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:38.570]  going, this is awesome town, man. All right. Where do I go smoke? And they're going,
[01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:45.850]  Colorado Springs, Colorado Springs, speakeasies, places like that. And that just took revenue out
[01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:54.570]  of a lot of people's hands. I'm talking Taco Bell, the chicken place, that's so many that
[01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:59.130]  has nothing to do with us. You know what I mean? Yeah. They're just leaving and going to Colorado
[01:09:59.130 --> 01:10:03.610]  Springs. They're getting gas and getting out. Yeah. So we can sell a product right outside of
[01:10:03.610 --> 01:10:08.490]  city limits and then they drive away. Right. Yeah. I mean, there's no reason that with the,
[01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:12.090]  as many places as there are in the County already, there's no reason to not allow them in the city.
[01:10:12.090 --> 01:10:19.370]  It's just, it's just ridiculous. It's pointless. There are just as many cannabis users, probably
[01:10:19.370 --> 01:10:26.490]  more in city limits. Does everybody here live in city limits? Everybody nods. Yes. And people
[01:10:26.490 --> 01:10:29.770]  behind me too. Oh, they're creeping on me. What's up guys? I'm scaring the shit out of me.
[01:10:32.250 --> 01:10:35.210]  You know, we've seen some progress lately, right? They've just allowed
[01:10:36.410 --> 01:10:44.970]  the grow operations, concentrate manufacturers and edibles manufacturers. The city council has
[01:10:44.970 --> 01:10:48.490]  just passed that. Misty's husband's asking for a microphone. I'll pass it to him and let him
[01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:54.250]  introduce himself. Hi, my name's Greg. And I'd like to say, you know, you guys were talking
[01:10:54.250 --> 01:11:01.290]  about the revenue aspect of this and everybody looks at it as a business aspect or aspect of it,
[01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:05.690]  which it is a business aspect of it. But when you guys are talking about Pueblo and like you guys
[01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:11.450]  talked about Pueblo County and all that stuff, and they're making revenue out there, well,
[01:11:11.450 --> 01:11:17.450]  the city's hurting for some revenue as well. So the taxes that the city would make half of these
[01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:23.370]  taxes that you would get for opening these clubs, that you're going to revenue inflate
[01:11:23.370 --> 01:11:28.010]  the city taxes. I think they forget about looking into that situation as well.
[01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:33.930]  So it's not only a business prospect for the personal owners or the personal people that are
[01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:40.410]  trying to make a profit or trying to make a business that works, it would also help the city
[01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:46.730]  and the city is also going to benefit off of these prospects that are coming about. So if they can
[01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:51.610]  just let things happen the way they're supposed to happen, it's already been voted in. It's already
[01:11:51.610 --> 01:11:57.210]  been the way it's supposed to be. It's already been around us. So if they can make this happen,
[01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.410]  it would only benefit the city as well as the people that are trying to make this happen to
[01:12:02.410 --> 01:12:10.730]  benefit themselves as well. So for as a business aspect, it would help the city and the state
[01:12:12.330 --> 01:12:14.570]  as well as the people that are trying to make this happen.
[01:12:14.570 --> 01:12:19.130]  Well, the revenue that we want to produce for the city, but I'm more right now at this point-
[01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:20.410]  Can you get on your mic a little Misty, please?
[01:12:20.410 --> 01:12:21.130]  I'm sorry.
[01:12:21.130 --> 01:12:24.250]  Thanks a lot for contributing, dude. I appreciate it. Hang around because I have a question for you
[01:12:24.250 --> 01:12:24.730]  in a second.
[01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:33.690]  The way I feel about it is that more that this should be a place of socialism. How long has
[01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:41.130]  people been saying, hey, come on, smoke a bowl? The drug that they're so afraid of that's called
[01:12:41.130 --> 01:12:48.970]  marijuana is something that people actually hang out and do great things with and socially hanging
[01:12:48.970 --> 01:12:54.250]  out and being people. And I just, I wish that they would just see that, that that's what it is,
[01:12:54.250 --> 01:12:55.050]  a social environment.
[01:12:55.610 --> 01:13:00.730]  One of the reasons that the city council said they don't want to open places like this is because
[01:13:00.730 --> 01:13:04.890]  if the police or fire department did have to come here, they would walk in and there's so
[01:13:04.890 --> 01:13:08.810]  much smoke in the room that they would be too high to do their jobs and they would be unable
[01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:10.970]  to perform. Greg, you're not a pot smoker, are you?
[01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:11.850]  No, sir.
[01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:16.170]  He said, no, sir. I didn't give him the mic back for that. Are you high being in here?
[01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:16.890]  No, sir.
[01:13:16.890 --> 01:13:20.010]  He said, no, sir. And shook his head. You've been here the whole time, right?
[01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:23.850]  Hour and a half or so. He's not high, you guys. So if your paramedics are getting high,
[01:13:23.850 --> 01:13:26.170]  if the cops are getting high, that's on their own time.
[01:13:26.170 --> 01:13:26.570]  Yeah.
[01:13:26.570 --> 01:13:27.610]  Just from being in here.
[01:13:27.610 --> 01:13:28.090]  Yeah.
[01:13:28.090 --> 01:13:29.530]  That's not from being in here.
[01:13:29.530 --> 01:13:30.410]  For sure.
[01:13:30.410 --> 01:13:33.290]  Yeah. So that excuse sucks. Find a new excuse, you guys.
[01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:40.810]  I just want to break in and say that we have the situation that we're facing because
[01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:50.170]  the municipality did not seek the citizens' input before these laws were put into place.
[01:13:50.170 --> 01:13:57.370]  So we had a situation where the people making the laws were not the people in the smoking community.
[01:13:58.170 --> 01:14:08.810]  And one of the things that the CRRC is a vehicle for the public to interface with its government.
[01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.810]  And I just want to break in and say that.
[01:14:10.810 --> 01:14:12.810]  Yeah. That's what sparked the CRRC.
[01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:19.610]  We'll be giving information on how to interface with us sometime during the program.
[01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:23.690]  Yeah. I will do an intro and an outro tags on this, and I'll make sure to get all the
[01:14:23.690 --> 01:14:26.170]  Facebook information, all the website, anything there is.
[01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:26.810]  Absolutely.
[01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:29.770]  I'll get all that on there. I try to keep up with all that stuff.
[01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:33.610]  So when is the next, what can the city council, the city members here do?
[01:14:33.610 --> 01:14:37.050]  Can we go to city council meetings and try to talk and try to just show a presence to
[01:14:37.050 --> 01:14:38.170]  help get these places open?
[01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:45.770]  Absolutely. The public is invited to city council meetings once.
[01:14:46.890 --> 01:14:49.770]  I believe it's twice a month. It's every other Monday.
[01:14:49.770 --> 01:14:50.730]  Every other Monday.
[01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:56.730]  Every other Monday, citizens can come out. They can sign up to speak to the council.
[01:14:57.530 --> 01:15:05.370]  They can ask questions and basically make themselves heard to the people
[01:15:05.850 --> 01:15:08.970]  that are affecting their lives every day.
[01:15:08.970 --> 01:15:11.930]  And that's not just here in Pueblo, you guys, you can do that wherever you are.
[01:15:11.930 --> 01:15:15.770]  If there's an issue, not just cannabis, but if you want to support cannabis,
[01:15:15.770 --> 01:15:19.210]  if you have something in your local region that you need fixed, go to city council,
[01:15:19.210 --> 01:15:22.170]  start finding out the steps you can take to get it on a ballot to talk to.
[01:15:22.170 --> 01:15:25.530]  Sometimes all you have to do is talk to a council member and they will solve a problem for you.
[01:15:25.530 --> 01:15:30.410]  We had a local issue here recently that got a little blown up and a city council member called
[01:15:30.410 --> 01:15:35.130]  the guy that had the problem. And he said, Hey, here's the solution. And that's all it took was
[01:15:35.450 --> 01:15:38.810]  them to talk. So maybe all you need to do is get with the right city council people.
[01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:43.530]  Everybody is kind of snickering in this room. I don't know if we should say any of that stuff.
[01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:46.010]  No, that's awesome.
[01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:48.650]  Let's go to the city council meetings and wherever you are and contribute,
[01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:51.690]  be part of that. You can't bitch and complain if you don't do something about it.
[01:15:54.970 --> 01:15:59.930]  What we've done so far with the CRRC working on Misty's behalf is we've gone to
[01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:03.290]  one city council member, the only one we could get an appointment with.
[01:16:03.930 --> 01:16:09.610]  And our proposal at that time was they want to put this on the ballot for recreational and medical
[01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:15.050]  sales within the city limits, but they want a tax on that. All right. So they want that on the
[01:16:15.050 --> 01:16:19.450]  ballot in November. So we're cool with that, but we want them to go ahead with the club rules,
[01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:24.650]  right? So we went in there suggesting that maybe you can put the clubs on the ballot as you want to
[01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:31.210]  in November, but in the meantime, issue us a provisional permit so that when people go to
[01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:36.970]  vote in November, they can vote based on actual facts, the actual operation of this business for
[01:16:36.970 --> 01:16:41.690]  a few months. And we were, you know, willing to accept a 30 day permit, you know, to start out
[01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:48.330]  just to show them how this business would operate. And we were told no. Well, they steered us to,
[01:16:48.330 --> 01:16:53.050]  why don't we try to get this moved up on the agenda? But we've hit a stone wall with that.
[01:16:53.050 --> 01:16:58.730]  So now we're asking for both. We're asking for a provisional permit and we want this on the
[01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:03.930]  agenda now rather than in November. And that, you know, that's really where we are and that's what
[01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:09.610]  we need support with. We need you to call, we need you to email your city council members and
[01:17:09.610 --> 01:17:16.410]  tell them that we want this on the agenda and we want some places open now so we can see how it
[01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:22.250]  works before we vote. It's working well tonight. It really is. I'll have Gary. Gary will take the
[01:17:22.250 --> 01:17:27.130]  responsibility of emailing me all of the phone numbers and email addresses and I will tweet them,
[01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:31.610]  Facebook them so that all the Agricultural listeners can see that big list. We've got a
[01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:36.490]  little army going on. Yeah. Thanks for everybody that will support us. And this sounds like just
[01:17:36.490 --> 01:17:40.490]  a big local pep talk, but guys, it's everywhere you are. If you have legal cannabis and you don't
[01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:44.650]  like what you have, you can, you can fix it. If you don't have legal cannabis, you can fix it.
[01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:50.330]  Let's get it going everywhere. Legalize the world is my opinion. I agree. So go ahead. Lee,
[01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:56.330]  you look like you had something profound about to say. I was just going to say that one thing that
[01:17:56.330 --> 01:18:04.090]  Puebloans and Coloradans in general should be embracing is their ability and their right
[01:18:04.090 --> 01:18:12.250]  to produce their own medicine. This is going unaddressed basically since the laws have been
[01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:20.890]  enacted and it's so much cheaper to produce your meds yourself. You know what you've got.
[01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:28.970]  There's so many other benefits and things you can do with the whole plant as opposed to just
[01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:37.610]  having the buds that you get at retail. And I just wanted to throw that in there. You can juice
[01:18:37.610 --> 01:18:41.770]  your leaves, you can make tea out of the roots. There's so many great things you can have. I think
[01:18:41.770 --> 01:18:45.530]  that we're going to be able to touch base on a lot of that on the educational. You know, I don't
[01:18:45.530 --> 01:18:50.170]  think that a lot of people, I think that they see that word marijuana as a fear factor. And I hope
[01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:55.610]  that on the 27th of this month here at the Brickyard, people are going to come in that are
[01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:59.850]  so curious that they want to get that close, but they don't want the smoke around. And they want
[01:18:59.850 --> 01:19:04.090]  knowledge and they want to know about it. And that's exactly what we're going to do on the 27th
[01:19:04.090 --> 01:19:08.170]  there. So on the 27th, I don't know if we've talked about this very much yet on the 27th here at the
[01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:12.650]  Brickyard in Pueblo, Colorado, I'll post the address and everything online. We are going to
[01:19:12.650 --> 01:19:17.770]  have an educational seminar. We'll have six or seven speakers, Gary, Lee, Misty, myself, a couple
[01:19:17.850 --> 01:19:21.130]  other folks are going to speak, uh, Terry from Mary Jane's shout out to Mary Jane's glass
[01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:25.930]  haberdashery, by the way. For sure. And you know, Terry was under the weather today. Um, she called
[01:19:25.930 --> 01:19:29.530]  me early and she said that she was not feeling very good, but you know what, if it wasn't for
[01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:34.410]  Terry and that's the honest to God truth, um, I wouldn't have taken the leap that I've taken.
[01:19:34.410 --> 01:19:41.290]  She put me in touch. I put her in touch with Gary. She asked me about this person to, um, just kind
[01:19:41.290 --> 01:19:46.970]  of have a great relationship with. She just is, um, a wonderful woman. I appreciate her immensely.
[01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:51.290]  So we're doing this, uh, this seminar, we're going to have some education. Our friend's going to do a
[01:19:51.290 --> 01:19:55.610]  little history lesson. Lee is going to bring, possibly bring businesses. We haven't solidified
[01:19:55.610 --> 01:20:00.650]  this yet, bring businesses and do like a job fair. Gary's going to run around and try to
[01:20:00.650 --> 01:20:05.130]  administrate everything. Well, something we'll have going on on the 27th is, uh, we'll have
[01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:11.130]  free memberships to the CRRC. So we want to, we want to sign up as many members as possible. And,
[01:20:11.130 --> 01:20:15.610]  um, you know, we're just in an organizational stage as we've been, you know, we've been
[01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:22.810]  assembled for less than a month. Right. So what we'll be doing is, you know, when it's the day to
[01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:28.170]  come to the city council to speak, we'll be, we'll be issuing action alerts to our base.
[01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:32.730]  So we want to get everybody signed up. Who's willing to, you know, to come out or send an email
[01:20:32.730 --> 01:20:37.370]  or make a phone call at those critical times. And we want to start collecting that as part of our
[01:20:37.370 --> 01:20:42.170]  seminar. So that'll be, you know, what I'm doing, you know, trying to drum up business memberships,
[01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:47.530]  things like that. And, uh, you know, we want to create, you know, after we get
[01:20:48.170 --> 01:20:55.530]  Misty's problem solved, we want to go forward with an organization that can be an activist for
[01:20:56.250 --> 01:21:01.530]  cannabis related businesses in the community and the cannabis community in general. And, you know,
[01:21:01.530 --> 01:21:09.450]  from us smokers, from medical users, recreational users for everybody. And, uh, we see the
[01:21:10.410 --> 01:21:18.730]  influence we have already as a small, just forming group. And we see the huge vacuum
[01:21:20.090 --> 01:21:26.730]  of influence on the local County and state level that there really needs to be an organization
[01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:30.250]  that's pushing for those interests. Cause there really isn't one.
[01:21:30.250 --> 01:21:35.130]  Right. And different chapters, you know, like I know that, um, Lee was talking about possibly
[01:21:35.130 --> 01:21:40.010]  having his own group up, you know, um, North. And I think that that's an awesome thing. And
[01:21:40.010 --> 01:21:45.850]  that's an awesome idea to have someone that you can rely on in, um, a statewide, you know,
[01:21:45.850 --> 01:21:50.890]  community that we may live, you know, 25, 30 minutes away, but we have someone we can connect
[01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:55.850]  with out there if we needed to. I think that's awesome. We definitely, we definitely want to go
[01:21:55.850 --> 01:22:03.290]  statewide with the organization. And one of the reasons goes back to what I was saying earlier
[01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:12.010]  about the satellite businesses around the marijuana industry and, um, uh, a, an organized
[01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:20.570]  group can go out and court industry that can bring long-term jobs. There needs to be a distribution
[01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:27.450]  hub between Denver and the front range. There isn't one now, and nobody's going out to court
[01:22:27.450 --> 01:22:34.010]  these businesses. Nobody's going out to court the production of, of packaging, all kinds of
[01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:40.410]  businesses that could be a hub in Pueblo and on the front range. And we need jobs here.
[01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:45.370]  Yeah. When I was going to say, and we don't want the big corporate bullshit coming in here either.
[01:22:45.370 --> 01:22:50.170]  We want to keep this local. We want to keep this a Colorado thing. You know what I mean?
[01:22:50.170 --> 01:22:55.450]  I don't, I don't want these big corporations from California and New York and these billionaires
[01:22:55.450 --> 01:23:00.330]  to come here and swoop something up that, you know, maybe a guy that's starting with 200,000,
[01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:04.890]  you know what I mean? I don't want, I think that it's going to suck if we just get bought out and
[01:23:04.890 --> 01:23:09.530]  it just becomes this big corporate thing. The money's here in Colorado and what's not here
[01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:18.890]  is the level of education that makes those people comfortable investing in what we've got going.
[01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:24.730]  And, and we take it upon ourselves as citizens and as business owners to start this group.
[01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:34.490]  To educate people and bring that level of education up to where it's not a dirty investment
[01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:41.370]  anymore. It's something that's above the board, something that's appreciated for what it is.
[01:23:41.370 --> 01:23:48.250]  It takes a good management to run any company, not just one in the marijuana industry.
[01:23:48.250 --> 01:23:52.090]  I just think my biggest fears is that we're going to have another, you know,
[01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:57.690]  um, another company come in here and they're going to bring all of their millions in and
[01:23:57.690 --> 01:24:01.530]  they're going to bring their corporate people and their workers from other states to move to
[01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:06.090]  Colorado to work their big grows and their big plants. I mean, that just, I think that that's
[01:24:06.090 --> 01:24:11.770]  a fear for a lot of Coloradoans that this is going to become a corporate thing because there is money
[01:24:11.770 --> 01:24:16.810]  to be made in cannabis. Those of us, those of us in the cannabis industry with small cannabis
[01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:23.290]  businesses, I fear it, but I see that I have a seed company. I breed seeds. I have a seed
[01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:27.770]  company that's well-known and does all right. But I see, uh, there was just, and I don't know
[01:24:27.770 --> 01:24:33.050]  enough about it recently. A member of Monsanto was part has become part of a dispensary team.
[01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:36.330]  And that's got a lot of us small timers kind of scared shitless right now.
[01:24:37.290 --> 01:24:39.530]  We don't know what's going to happen. I can be squeezed out instantly.
[01:24:41.210 --> 01:24:45.850]  The only way to prevent that is the people that work with small businesses like us know we offer
[01:24:45.850 --> 01:24:50.730]  that loving cared for all my buddies over there shaking their head. Like, yeah, that guy loves his
[01:24:50.730 --> 01:24:54.890]  shit. Just like you can get the same thing at Applebee's at every Applebee's that you go to.
[01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:59.370]  But when you come over to a different restaurant, that's homegrown, you get a different atmosphere
[01:24:59.370 --> 01:25:02.810]  and you get a different feel. I agree with that. But I still don't think, um, you know, that,
[01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:09.130]  I don't know, I'm, I'm willing to put it out there with the big companies coming in here.
[01:25:09.130 --> 01:25:13.210]  And we have people that can do it right now. You know what I mean? That it just seems like
[01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:16.330]  there's an itch on it, but you have enough dollars in your pocket and it's deep enough.
[01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:21.450]  Things are going to be changing drastically over the next 10 years. This is going to be
[01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:25.850]  totally different. So if you bring a cannabis business here, please utilize our, our talent.
[01:25:25.850 --> 01:25:29.610]  That's here. Don't bring your own, your own staff. That sucks. They'll come here and bring
[01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:34.250]  your own California people. He's Colorado. Yeah, we need jobs. We're talented. We're smart.
[01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:40.810]  So we have this event that we're talking about my portion for the event on seven 27. I am going,
[01:25:40.810 --> 01:25:45.850]  if the lawyer will, uh, will approve this, I'm going to bring a small growth setup here to the
[01:25:45.850 --> 01:25:50.330]  brickyard and set it up here over there in that corner is my intention. People are looking at
[01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:53.130]  me like, are you really going to do that? Yeah. That's a wonderful thing. I'm going to bring a
[01:25:53.130 --> 01:25:57.450]  grow hut, a little four by four grow hut with a 600 watt, maybe a thousand watt light in that
[01:25:57.450 --> 01:26:01.850]  bitch. And a few live plants, grow some weed over there in the corner for a few hours.
[01:26:01.850 --> 01:26:05.610]  And you're going to tell us all about it though. I'm going to talk about my throat will be shot
[01:26:06.570 --> 01:26:14.890]  about that. Yeah, I will be there. And for my part in it, I plan to do a presentation about the
[01:26:14.890 --> 01:26:22.890]  health and holistic side of not only marijuana, but of several different botanicals. A lot of
[01:26:22.890 --> 01:26:30.090]  people know, but marijuana may be good for medicine, but they're not quite sure how. And
[01:26:30.970 --> 01:26:38.730]  one of the things that, uh, on a business level, I tell my clients is that most pharmaceutical
[01:26:39.370 --> 01:26:46.490]  products are synthesized from, or based on a botanical, uh, that you can find in nature.
[01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:55.290]  And so once you know that, uh, you can start to, um, help yourself, uh, to affect your health
[01:26:55.930 --> 01:27:05.290]  situ- excuse me, affect your health situation. I'm sorry. And so we'll be talking about, uh, how
[01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:13.610]  you can use marijuana and other botanicals, uh, as medicine. We'll have some samples to give out,
[01:27:13.610 --> 01:27:23.290]  uh, we'll have, uh, medical personnel on hand to answer questions, uh, and try to, um, bring a level
[01:27:23.290 --> 01:27:30.010]  of understanding, uh, about the medical uses of marijuana. Come out and check it out, you guys.
[01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:34.330]  It's 727. That's July 27th at the Brickyard. It's going to be great. You're going to learn a lot.
[01:27:34.970 --> 01:27:38.570]  If you haven't ever seen live growing plants, I'll have plants that'll be, uh,
[01:27:39.290 --> 01:27:44.250]  about 28, 30 days into flower. You'll get to see some female plants. I may have some that are like
[01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:49.130]  70 days in. If I decide to let it go that long, it may be a little too far, but I might let it go
[01:27:49.210 --> 01:27:53.370]  just for the listeners to come check out, for the people to come see. We'll have some blue dream
[01:27:53.370 --> 01:28:00.490]  that's just yellow as shit. You never know. And just some plugs, uh, we have several businesses
[01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:09.130]  that are represented within the CRRC. Say their names and be proud. We have Mary Jane's Glass.
[01:28:09.130 --> 01:28:15.850]  Of course, we have Legends represented. Uh, we have the Brickyard here and, uh, we have, uh,
[01:28:16.410 --> 01:28:23.450]  nonstop nursing and nurturing, which has a Facebook page. Uh, you can find grow Pueblo
[01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:31.850]  on Facebook, uh, and that company supports, uh, growing all kinds of botanical, uh, products in
[01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:40.010]  Pueblo. Uh, some people may have come to, uh, the Super Bud Bowl and, uh, you can find that page
[01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:47.450]  on Facebook as well. And a lot of this information will, uh, trickle down on all of these Facebook
[01:28:47.450 --> 01:28:56.570]  pages. Uh, so you can connect with us, uh, the CRRC, uh, in a lot of different ways, not just,
[01:28:56.570 --> 01:29:04.970]  um, uh, trying to catch us at a council meeting. Uh, we are part of your community and you,
[01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:09.930]  you know, us already. Absolutely. Yeah. I've been here for a while. You probably know me.
[01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:17.050]  Gary's kind of new Gary's from Texas. Yeah. Welcome. You're doing us a service. We're
[01:29:17.050 --> 01:29:21.050]  glad you're here. I appreciate that. We need somebody. Uh, yeah, we need guys like Lee and
[01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:25.530]  Gary that are articulate and do the research and can speak while we're a bit misty is running a
[01:29:25.530 --> 01:29:31.530]  business and I'm breeding seeds. You guys doing the research. So what is our main goal on the 27th?
[01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:35.210]  Are we just trying to educate them? Are we trying to show them that this isn't scary?
[01:29:35.210 --> 01:29:39.290]  This is going to be a smoke-free environment on the 27th. Is there an age limit?
[01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:43.050]  You know, we kind of talked about it. We're going to have live plants here.
[01:29:43.610 --> 01:29:48.410]  We might need to be careful. I think that, I think that we're focusing on adults. And I think that
[01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:52.810]  in our society right now, we're considering adults, 21 years of age, even though you can go
[01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:57.210]  and you can fight for your country at the age of 18, which bothers me a little bit, but in our
[01:29:57.210 --> 01:30:01.690]  society right now, I think that we need to abide by the rules. And I think that this is 21 up.
[01:30:01.690 --> 01:30:07.450]  I don't want to teach a 16 or 17 year old how to grow a plant right now to focus on other things.
[01:30:07.530 --> 01:30:14.170]  It is the adult's responsibility to take knowledge home and share that with their children. So
[01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:21.050]  we're trying to start from the parents and the adults, the pillars of the community
[01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:27.530]  and have that knowledge trickle down into the next generation, which is going to view this
[01:30:27.530 --> 01:30:34.810]  industry as something that has always been there. So we need to make their impression
[01:30:34.810 --> 01:30:40.890]  and their opportunity and their future in this industry, something that's going to make them
[01:30:40.890 --> 01:30:47.050]  want to stay on the front range and not just run away to Denver or some other state.
[01:30:48.090 --> 01:30:51.610]  I hope some of my friends from Denver come down to check this out. Cause I go to all your stuff
[01:30:51.610 --> 01:30:56.650]  up there, guys come down to Pueblo. It's not as bad as you think. Come down and check it out. So
[01:30:56.650 --> 01:31:00.570]  that way you can find out if it really does suck or if it's cool. And if it does suck and you've
[01:31:00.570 --> 01:31:04.890]  been here, then you can actually talk some shit, but come down, see me check out the girl I've got
[01:31:04.890 --> 01:31:09.290]  set up here. I'm going to try to talk Misty into letting me have a little VIP after hours party
[01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:13.370]  here in the brickyard and maybe record another podcast. I haven't mentioned that to her until
[01:31:13.370 --> 01:31:17.210]  just now, but she's smiling. So I think that that'd be awesome. There may be a little, another
[01:31:17.210 --> 01:31:22.090]  one of these sessions here right after that little thing. So yeah, come on down. Everybody
[01:31:22.090 --> 01:31:26.170]  from Denver, everybody from Pueblo come meet the Agro Culture crew. I'll be here. Come learn a lot.
[01:31:26.170 --> 01:31:30.730]  It'll be a good time until then come to the city council meetings. When is the next one? You guys
[01:31:30.730 --> 01:31:37.610]  know Monday, Monday, Monday, 7. What's the date on Monday? You got me. That's coming up. Cause
[01:31:37.610 --> 01:31:42.650]  we're recording on like a Tuesday or something. Everybody in the room just went for their iPhone.
[01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:49.130]  Nobody cares. I don't even have my phone. I heard it was stuck in my pocket. It's the seventh Monday,
[01:31:49.130 --> 01:31:55.050]  the seventh, Monday, the seventh, Monday, the seventh city hall. Uh, it's on the third floor.
[01:31:55.050 --> 01:31:59.690]  It is seven o'clock. And I think it's called city hall place. Isn't that the street that it's
[01:31:59.690 --> 01:32:04.890]  actually? It is. Yeah. Seven o'clock. We'll be there. Come support us. Help us get a cannabis
[01:32:04.890 --> 01:32:11.050]  social club open the brickyard, 10 27 South Pueblo. So something that way to frame this,
[01:32:11.050 --> 01:32:16.730]  just as a final thought is right now, the city of Pueblo is proposing a half cent sales tax to
[01:32:16.730 --> 01:32:20.970]  pay for police and fire who's gotten their fingernails in here. That's weird. Fingernails
[01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:29.530]  on the floor. That's fucking odd. So why couldn't we have smoking clubs and their taxes fund the
[01:32:29.530 --> 01:32:35.690]  police and fire instead of another half cent sales tax? I mean, has anyone proposed that to them?
[01:32:35.690 --> 01:32:39.290]  No, they're worried about their firefighters and their police officers. Let's give them a half
[01:32:39.290 --> 01:32:46.170]  percent of our sales here. Your sales here. And I need to get some sales. If this is a social
[01:32:46.170 --> 01:32:50.090]  smoking lounge and this is close to my neighborhood, this is my hood. This is the part of
[01:32:50.090 --> 01:32:55.210]  town I represent for Pueblo. I will be here often. Everybody sitting on that couch will be here. If
[01:32:55.210 --> 01:32:59.770]  I'm here dabbing, those guys will be here dabbing. All these guys will be here. They'll be here.
[01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:05.450]  So I said, she, there are females here, guys. Pretty ladies here waving at us. It's not just
[01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:14.730]  a sausage fest. Some gorgeous women in the place. Lots of them. Hi, gypsy. Yeah. It's not a sausage
[01:33:14.730 --> 01:33:19.770]  fest. So come on, have fun with us at the brickyard. Let's get this place open. All right,
[01:33:19.770 --> 01:33:23.370]  guys. Thanks again, Jeff. Oh man. Thanks for having me. I want to turn it into kind of some
[01:33:23.370 --> 01:33:27.050]  fun since we've had a lot of serious talk. Do you guys have anything to wrap it up with? Yeah. No.
[01:33:27.050 --> 01:33:30.010]  Is there anything? I'm out of here. All right. Misty's got to run. She's going to go. Who wants
[01:33:30.010 --> 01:33:34.730]  to come sit in Misty's spot and talk some shit on the agriculture podcast? Who wants to come take a
[01:33:34.730 --> 01:33:41.130]  big dab? I'll do a big dab. Gary's going to do a big dab. We have. Can somebody talk for a second
[01:33:41.210 --> 01:33:44.010]  while I hear I'll just put this mic in a mic stand. You're going to hear a thump guys.
[01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:47.930]  Sorry about that. All right. I'm going to get Gary a big dab. We're going to give him a dab
[01:33:47.930 --> 01:33:51.210]  on the show. Adam's going to come jump up and use the mic. Everyone who smokes should be producing
[01:33:51.210 --> 01:33:58.410]  their own meds. I can't stress that enough. If you've got a closet, if you've got any locked
[01:33:58.410 --> 01:34:07.370]  space, you can produce high quality meds. You don't have to, you can use a dispensary,
[01:34:07.450 --> 01:34:19.130]  retail outlet sometimes, but the whole idea of having legal marijuana is so it's accessible to
[01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:28.250]  everyone. And it's such an easy plant to grow. It's fucking weed. And a lot of our interest
[01:34:28.250 --> 01:34:33.930]  and a lot of our focus is going to be on education on how to produce your own marijuana.
[01:34:34.010 --> 01:34:38.890]  I'll let you do the work. Thank you. And just to add on to that, it feels good. It's kind of
[01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:44.730]  a big one for Gary. Growing your own makes you, it slows you down. You have to take time and slow
[01:34:44.730 --> 01:34:50.650]  down and, and, and take care of things besides just what's going on with everyday life. Like if
[01:34:52.890 --> 01:34:57.450]  I've only been growing for a couple of years and it does, it really, it's like meditation in a way,
[01:34:57.450 --> 01:35:01.530]  you know, and, and it was one of those things that I didn't know about. I was a gamer. I've
[01:35:01.530 --> 01:35:06.250]  had fish and all the, all those things stopped when I started growing, you know, it took over
[01:35:06.250 --> 01:35:12.970]  my life. So you can't rush a pot plant. No, you can't. No doubt. And it brings understanding of
[01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:20.490]  other, other things in your life. Believe it or not, will parallel what you're doing in the grow
[01:35:20.490 --> 01:35:28.170]  room. Sorry, I failed. It's a place for insight. It's a place for stimulation. You can continue
[01:35:28.170 --> 01:35:34.410]  your education. Uh, it's, there's so many benefits in getting involved in something new,
[01:35:34.970 --> 01:35:41.770]  uh, something you always did. You always smoked, but you never could quite, uh, make the leap.
[01:35:41.770 --> 01:35:46.730]  Uh, we're going to try to make it easier for everybody to get growing in Pueblo.
[01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:52.970]  And I'm sure Jeff will attain to this, that you learn something every day growing. I,
[01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:56.490]  every day there's, it never stops because if you don't learn something every day,
[01:35:56.490 --> 01:36:01.050]  then your girl gets old and you're never having a great girl. And I'm that guy that always strives
[01:36:01.050 --> 01:36:05.450]  to get to the next level. Well, you seem like a fairly fit and healthy kind of guy. Do you think
[01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:09.530]  that growing your own cannabis has contributed to you paying? And I know you're a farmer,
[01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:13.770]  you grow other fruits and vegetables. Does it contribute to you taking better care of yourself
[01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:20.410]  as a, as a being? I'm so glad you asked that question. Uh, for the past month, I've been
[01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:30.250]  working on a surface mine out in Rye. And so, um, for six hours a day, I move, uh, hundreds,
[01:36:30.250 --> 01:36:38.170]  we do about two tons a day of marble granite rock. Wow. And you know, it's such a beautiful setting,
[01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:45.210]  um, up there in Rye, uh, we can, we can smoke there. We can, we can kick it, but the work is
[01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:50.970]  hard and I wouldn't be able to do that work. Uh, if these myths about marijuana was true,
[01:36:51.530 --> 01:36:58.650]  uh, I even smoke a pack a week of cigarettes, believe it or not. And so don't buy into all the
[01:36:59.530 --> 01:37:07.130]  stereotypes about, uh, you've got to be, uh, unfit because you use marijuana. It's just not true.
[01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:13.370]  Thanks for coming, Greg. Greg's leaving guys. Everybody listen and say bye Greg. I opened
[01:37:13.450 --> 01:37:18.410]  your car right now and you just went by Greg. They'll be back. They'll be back. So if you were
[01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:22.970]  a lazy pothead, like they claim you wouldn't be able to work in a mine. I'd never, I'd never,
[01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:28.250]  I'd never take the job. I'd kill you, Gary. I'm sorry. Awesome. It was just right. I bumped into
[01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:32.090]  Lee after he was working one day. I happened to be stopping at the same gas station. This dude
[01:37:32.090 --> 01:37:36.810]  was covered in dust from head to toe. He looked like he had just been buried and dug out of the
[01:37:36.810 --> 01:37:41.370]  dirt. That man was doing work that day. He looked burnt too. He looked fried. That was a man that
[01:37:41.370 --> 01:37:48.090]  had spent his day. You guys should go to go to go to Facebook and check out grow Pueblo.
[01:37:48.810 --> 01:37:55.530]  It's a Facebook page and I've got a little plot of land and I use that plot to show people
[01:37:55.530 --> 01:38:03.930]  how much produce you can produce yourself in a small area. Last year, grow Pueblo donated over
[01:38:04.010 --> 01:38:13.610]  2000 pounds of fresh produce to the Salvation Army, the Pueblo soup kitchen, the Pueblo women's
[01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:21.450]  shelter and the YWCA. It was fresh watermelons, cantaloupe, squash, peppers, you name it. And
[01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:28.810]  the gardens bigger this this year. So go to go to grow Pueblo like the page. There's a lot of
[01:38:28.810 --> 01:38:36.410]  information we give not only on growing produce, but on producing marijuana as well.
[01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:39.530]  Got to take care of yourselves, guys. Here's something I want to mention that's kind of random.
[01:38:39.530 --> 01:38:43.770]  Gary just took a gigantic dab and I'm going to put him on the spot. I heard you say that since
[01:38:43.770 --> 01:38:48.330]  you've moved to Colorado, you've gotten off of a lot of the medications you were taking and you
[01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:54.570]  have lost 10 pounds per month since you've moved here. Is that accurate? It is. And I can see it
[01:38:54.570 --> 01:38:58.170]  now that now that we've hang we hang out a little more frequently. I could definitely see it start
[01:38:58.170 --> 01:39:03.930]  shedding off. Yeah. Yeah, it's I was I have a three fused vertebrae in my neck, cervical spine.
[01:39:04.490 --> 01:39:10.410]  So really bad spot, you know, real painful all the time. Like sleeping is painful. Sitting is painful.
[01:39:10.410 --> 01:39:17.690]  Standing and walking is painful. So when I moved here, I had quit my last job because at the end
[01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:21.770]  of the day, I was unable to get out of the chair, like literally unable to get out of the chair
[01:39:21.770 --> 01:39:27.450]  and had to have help getting to my car. So I just quit and, you know, started doing the freelance
[01:39:27.450 --> 01:39:33.210]  thing, did that for about six months. It was going really well. And I decided to relocate here. And
[01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:40.730]  when I got here and had access to cannabis regularly, I stopped taking I was taking
[01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:45.370]  six hydrocodone a day. I stopped taking all of them within 30 days of being here.
[01:39:47.930 --> 01:39:52.170]  You know, I can be more active. I can be more productive. I'm a full time student
[01:39:52.730 --> 01:40:00.810]  working on an MBA at CSU. And, you know, I get my schoolwork done faster. My grades have improved
[01:40:02.170 --> 01:40:05.130]  everything. Yeah, I've lost 10 pounds a month steadily since I've been here
[01:40:05.850 --> 01:40:08.810]  and made some changes in my diet. And that's actually accelerated now.
[01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:13.290]  So compared to from when I first had you, we had you on a podcast. You've been on a couple of our
[01:40:13.290 --> 01:40:18.890]  shows. You were on episode four of the Agriculture podcast. This is, I think, 17 or 18 ish. So we've
[01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:25.610]  been cranking them out. Your thought process is longer and you can speak longer. When I think
[01:40:25.610 --> 01:40:31.050]  that's probably from switching pills to cannabis. Exactly. You're a little more with us. Yeah. And,
[01:40:31.050 --> 01:40:36.730]  you know, that really focuses in, like, on the smoking club thing, right? How many people are out
[01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:43.130]  walking around high on pills? You look at the numbers of people prescribed pain medication.
[01:40:43.130 --> 01:40:47.290]  Yeah. That's got to be a lot of fucking people, man. I bet everybody. There's a lot of high people
[01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:50.730]  has a bottle of some kind of pain medicine that they were just given that they don't need,
[01:40:50.730 --> 01:40:57.530]  that the doctor just kind of force fed them. The United States uses 90% of all the pharmaceutical
[01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:05.290]  prescription pain meds that are produced. You told everybody to gather around. The United States
[01:41:05.290 --> 01:41:13.530]  uses 90% of that. And the rest of the world gets headaches and has back pains, but they don't
[01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:21.610]  go the pharmaceutical route. Do they not still use natural stuff? I mean...
[01:41:21.610 --> 01:41:29.770]  And that goes, I'm glad you asked that. And so to give people a practical example,
[01:41:30.330 --> 01:41:38.250]  you go to the doctor, you get a script for Ambien or something like that for your sleep issue. And
[01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:47.610]  it's got a high risk of dependence. It's got terrible side effects. And that doctor could
[01:41:47.610 --> 01:41:55.610]  very well have told you Valerian will do the exact same thing with no side effects.
[01:41:56.650 --> 01:42:00.410]  You're not going to get hooked on it. But no one wants to chew on no damn
[01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:04.170]  root anymore, man. You can take his little purple pill. You're also used to just popping
[01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:12.170]  You can make a tea with it. You can compress it into pills. You can bake it into a cake
[01:42:12.170 --> 01:42:26.810]  and have that cake at bedtime. And so across the medical board, across the scale of illnesses,
[01:42:26.810 --> 01:42:33.690]  there are botanicals that affect those illnesses in a positive way. And
[01:42:35.130 --> 01:42:41.450]  my core company is called Non-Stop Wellness. And that's what Non-Stop Wellness does,
[01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:49.930]  is empowers people with the information they need to affect their health outside of traditional
[01:42:49.930 --> 01:42:56.490]  medicine. And I've been here in Pueblo for four years now. I've run a doctor's office that
[01:42:56.490 --> 01:43:05.130]  provided access to the Red Card Registry and provided a lot of services to people
[01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:16.010]  with serious illnesses, illnesses like bone cancer, like multiple sclerosis. You have to excuse me.
[01:43:16.010 --> 01:43:16.570]  No, you're good.
[01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:29.850]  Um, even arthritis, ocular pressure across the board. And there are specific strains of cannabis
[01:43:29.850 --> 01:43:38.650]  or other botanicals that under proper medical supervision have just as high
[01:43:39.130 --> 01:43:45.610]  um, success outcomes as their pharmaceutical counterparts.
[01:43:47.370 --> 01:43:50.330]  Do you work with the principle of hot and cold herbs? So if you give me valerian,
[01:43:50.330 --> 01:43:52.010]  you got to give me something cool to work to.
[01:43:52.010 --> 01:44:01.210]  Well, exactly. And, uh, some herbs are cooling herbs, some heat the body. And so
[01:44:01.850 --> 01:44:12.650]  mint versus cinnamon would be a good example of those two working at opposite ends of that scale.
[01:44:12.650 --> 01:44:13.930]  Promotes good heart health.
[01:44:13.930 --> 01:44:23.610]  Absolutely. And so the heating herbs are effective with things like people who are
[01:44:23.610 --> 01:44:32.890]  cold, who have chills, uh, the cooling herbs, lower blood, uh, blood pressure. And, uh, even
[01:44:32.890 --> 01:44:45.770]  something as simple as a, um, tepid bath, uh, versus a hot bath versus a cold bath, uh, can
[01:44:45.770 --> 01:44:55.770]  have a positive effect on a wide range of, uh, illness. And I'm speaking generally because I'm
[01:44:55.770 --> 01:45:01.530]  not trying to give any health advice. I'm just trying to point people in the right direction.
[01:45:02.090 --> 01:45:06.650]  It's all right. I didn't need to see your medical degree. Dr. Lee, we got you, man. I'm with you.
[01:45:06.650 --> 01:45:09.370]  Oh, well, I'm pretty buzzed now, but okay.
[01:45:09.370 --> 01:45:11.690]  Yeah. Well, I give him a dab right at the start of the show that might've.
[01:45:11.690 --> 01:45:15.530]  You said earlier to the, you grow vegetables and different plants and stuff like that.
[01:45:15.530 --> 01:45:19.050]  And like you were saying earlier, if you want to learn to grow, you don't have to grow marijuana.
[01:45:19.050 --> 01:45:23.530]  Growing is growing, you know, like getting out there in the garden will alleviate the
[01:45:23.530 --> 01:45:28.010]  stress that you have in your life. Absolutely. You know, if you, if you live in a state where
[01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:33.530]  you can't grow, get out there and start a garden, grow corn, grow tomatoes, you know, tomato plant is
[01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:36.010]  just about the same, except for you can actually eat the fruit.
[01:45:36.010 --> 01:45:40.170]  Tony's going to argue with you that way. Yeah. They feed totally differently, but
[01:45:40.170 --> 01:45:43.290]  yeah, I'll still, you got to learn the responsibility. And you got to be out
[01:45:43.290 --> 01:45:46.250]  there every morning with it. You got to play with the dirt. You got to get rid of bugs. You
[01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:50.330]  got to learn when to harvest. It's all the same principle. Just transfer to a different plant.
[01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:56.970]  The whole world works on the agricultural principle. And even for you religious people,
[01:45:58.730 --> 01:46:06.650]  biblical principles become clear when you grow things. And so, you know, you may hear someone
[01:46:06.650 --> 01:46:12.490]  say nip it in the bud or, or they want to get down to the root of something, but until you've
[01:46:12.490 --> 01:46:19.130]  grown something and experienced a growth cycle, a lot of things just aren't clear.
[01:46:19.930 --> 01:46:26.250]  People were meant to have that relationship with the earth and it's been sorely neglected,
[01:46:27.610 --> 01:46:33.370]  excuse me, neglected by the past couple of generations.
[01:46:33.370 --> 01:46:37.930]  Absolutely. Yeah. We've taken the, uh, the plants out of the ground. We've taken the plants out of
[01:46:37.930 --> 01:46:41.370]  the ground. We've ground them up and we've made little pills that are mixed with a whole bunch
[01:46:41.370 --> 01:46:44.570]  of other bullshit. Not only that, but now we have plants that don't reproduce, you know,
[01:46:44.570 --> 01:46:48.810]  they just, they grow one time. Look at all the other countries where, uh, people eat fruit and
[01:46:48.810 --> 01:46:53.210]  vegetables all day long. They don't have the cancers, craps and tumors and craps that we have
[01:46:53.210 --> 01:46:57.450]  here. They're not obese. They're not crazy. They're crazy as fuck, but they don't have all
[01:46:57.450 --> 01:47:03.130]  the issues we have. The problem is in our government. Uh, what happens is our, our,
[01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:10.970]  our elected officials, uh, are bought by the corporate interest. And, um, you know,
[01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:18.250]  there's a very good chance that Barack Obama will become part of the staff of Monsanto
[01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:25.610]  when he leaves office. That's the kind of tricks they pull in, in government. And he's appointed,
[01:47:26.330 --> 01:47:36.810]  several people that have taken away our right to be informed about what we buy at retail,
[01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:45.690]  for our bodies. I'm about to give Tony a pretty big dab here. So when you hear some choking,
[01:47:45.690 --> 01:47:53.050]  that's my web designer. Dude, we've had a lot of traffic in and out. I like it. This was kind
[01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:58.570]  of a success. I want to thank everybody that's still here for hanging out. I know you guys are
[01:47:58.570 --> 01:48:02.650]  waiting in line for dabs. I'll get you. I promise. I'm just fucking rambling and dabbing and doing
[01:48:02.650 --> 01:48:07.290]  all that. Everybody introduced yourself. Thanks for coming. Reve. Sorry. I didn't say hi to Arnie
[01:48:07.290 --> 01:48:10.330]  yet. And he's outside having a cigarette, big shout out to Reve and Arnie for showing up. Reve's
[01:48:10.330 --> 01:48:17.130]  a listener. She listens all the time. So I'm glad she's here. Uh-huh. So we got, I grow culture.
[01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:26.010]  We got Mary Jane's Glass Legends. These places, we've got Facebook pages. The CRRC
[01:48:26.730 --> 01:48:35.930]  has a Facebook page that's up. We've got some people standing here, so they should probably
[01:48:37.210 --> 01:48:42.090]  get the mic and- Yeah, if you guys got something to say, let's hear what you got to say.
[01:48:42.090 --> 01:48:48.330]  Sure. Yeah. What's up? This is Andrew. Just chilling here with these guys. Yeah, I wanted
[01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:53.210]  to add on to what you were saying about cannabis growing just being good overall for your health.
[01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:59.050]  Time for me to dab. It really is. I mean, it can be a lot of heavy lifting involved. If you're
[01:48:59.050 --> 01:49:05.690]  even doing aquaponics or stuff like that, it can be like construction. And it really is good to
[01:49:05.690 --> 01:49:09.930]  grow as a person that way. You learn a lot about different things that don't even have to do with
[01:49:09.930 --> 01:49:15.690]  growing that you can utilize in your everyday work. So I don't know, it's all around a good
[01:49:15.690 --> 01:49:21.210]  thing for you. And I've lost tons of weight since I've started doing it. It's a great thing for
[01:49:21.210 --> 01:49:28.490]  everyone involved. It really is. That's a great point. And to that point, I also want to debunk
[01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:34.810]  another myth that goes hand in hand with that. People say you smoke and then you got to eat,
[01:49:34.810 --> 01:49:40.170]  you get the munchies and so you get fat. But that's not what's happening at all.
[01:49:40.170 --> 01:49:47.370]  What happens is you smoke marijuana and it raises your metabolism. And people identify that with
[01:49:47.370 --> 01:49:54.090]  hunger, but it's not hunger. It's your body. It's an opportunity for you to get moving. And it's
[01:49:54.650 --> 01:50:03.050]  your body telling you that it's switching from using food to burning fat. Somebody told me if I
[01:50:03.050 --> 01:50:07.770]  brush my teeth right after I smoke, I won't get the munchies. I don't know if I tried it or not.
[01:50:07.770 --> 01:50:11.290]  I don't know about that. Did you guys have it? Yeah, I forgot. I got stoned and forgot. So you
[01:50:11.290 --> 01:50:14.810]  guys that are listening, go, if you haven't smoked a bowl, if you don't have the munchies,
[01:50:14.810 --> 01:50:18.650]  if you normally get the munchies, smoke a bowl and brush your teeth and see if it happens.
[01:50:18.650 --> 01:50:22.810]  But as a new grower, as a new grower, since you're paying attention to your plants now,
[01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:27.130]  do you pay attention to your pH a little bit more? Because you got to pay, you said aquaponics. I
[01:50:27.130 --> 01:50:31.370]  assume that takes a lot of pH adjustment. Do you think about what you're putting into yourself and
[01:50:31.370 --> 01:50:36.330]  your own personal pH balance? I've just started dabbling into that. I read a little article about
[01:50:36.330 --> 01:50:41.050]  it. It got me interested, but I don't know much about it. You'll see the plants when you work with
[01:50:41.050 --> 01:50:45.370]  the plants and feed them properly and love them, they grow and look healthy. And I can only imagine
[01:50:45.930 --> 01:50:49.210]  I've seen what happens when I feed my plants a shitty nutrient. And that's what I think of when
[01:50:49.210 --> 01:50:53.370]  I eat a Snickers bar. I'm like, I'm never going to be able to make fat buds from eating a Snickers
[01:50:53.370 --> 01:50:58.170]  bar. Yeah, you need a carbo load. Yeah, exactly. There you go. I try to stay away from the advanced
[01:50:58.170 --> 01:51:02.410]  nutrients, but yeah, the proper carbo load would be a good idea. I'm going to take a dab. Who's got
[01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:09.610]  something to say? Gary, I met you the same night that I met Jeff, which was at another
[01:51:11.050 --> 01:51:16.010]  dab association type bar gathering. And I mean, dude, you look great since then. So I mean,
[01:51:16.730 --> 01:51:20.730]  anybody trying to tell you that marijuana is not working is some kind of-
[01:51:20.730 --> 01:51:22.970]  Going to make you fat. Yeah. I mean, dude,
[01:51:23.770 --> 01:51:28.090]  I've smoked pot pretty much all my life. My parents both smoked pot. They grew pot.
[01:51:29.290 --> 01:51:36.410]  Maybe it's my habit metabolism, but I highly doubt it. It's one thing I can't, I don't eat
[01:51:36.410 --> 01:51:42.730]  until I smoke pot. I mean, that's one of the things. We'll get a bag and I won't eat for three
[01:51:42.730 --> 01:51:47.850]  or four hours afterwards just because I want to be able to enjoy my high. I'm one of those people
[01:51:47.850 --> 01:51:52.250]  that if I get in the shower or if I eat a burger or something like that, I'm done. It's done. It's
[01:51:52.250 --> 01:51:57.290]  gone. And then I'm going back into my bag and you're not going to get high after that.
[01:51:57.290 --> 01:52:01.930]  I try to wait as long as I can after I eat to get stoned. Someone else is shaking their head like,
[01:52:01.930 --> 01:52:07.770]  yep, me too. People tend to think that hunger pains are going to kill them and that's not the
[01:52:07.770 --> 01:52:18.890]  case at all. If you just wait, they'll go away. It is. Misty is clenching-
[01:52:18.890 --> 01:52:20.650]  It's a good point. Food's a social tool.
[01:52:20.970 --> 01:52:27.850]  And it's also something to do with my hands. I just get bored and I need some chips or something.
[01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:32.170]  You got to grab a hole and get out of the garden.
[01:52:33.370 --> 01:52:35.770]  I knew what you meant, but I was waiting for that punchline, Wade.
[01:52:37.690 --> 01:52:41.290]  He's having flashbacks of Wade. Yeah, it's like Wade was on the show again.
[01:52:41.930 --> 01:52:50.330]  But yeah, there's all kinds of stuff to do to recondition yourself to have better habits.
[01:52:50.970 --> 01:53:02.570]  And it's a tough proposition, but it's worth it in the end. And so growing things is a great way
[01:53:04.250 --> 01:53:09.210]  to do that. There's plenty of grow lessons coming up from this show and already given on this show.
[01:53:10.090 --> 01:53:12.490]  Don't be afraid. We'll teach you how to grow plenty of great weed.
[01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:17.850]  Something I want to mention, be hungry once in a while. There are plenty of hungry fucking people
[01:53:17.850 --> 01:53:22.090]  in plenty of places that don't have it as well as you do. Be hungry once in a while. See what
[01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:27.050]  that's like. Quit being a whiny bitch all the time. Be hungry. Feel that. And when you're like,
[01:53:27.050 --> 01:53:33.050]  damn, I'm hungry, be a little hungrier just once. If you've got a refrigerator, then you're better
[01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:40.250]  off than almost 70% of the population. And if there's something in it, you're killing it.
[01:53:40.250 --> 01:53:45.050]  What, 85%? You're not just using it for air conditioning like at my house? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:53:45.050 --> 01:53:49.610]  So Adam stands in front of the freezer. He puts his head in there and fans himself to cool down.
[01:53:50.330 --> 01:53:56.090]  I don't have air conditioner. So a little bit. You can put your feet in a pan of ice water.
[01:53:56.970 --> 01:54:05.610]  Just a few points to kind of refocus. We want the same kind of representation that we've already got
[01:54:05.610 --> 01:54:14.330]  for alcohol. We don't want anything new. We don't want anything fancy. We also want the citizens to
[01:54:14.330 --> 01:54:23.850]  be involved in the law making part of the industry. We also want government to understand
[01:54:24.410 --> 01:54:30.330]  that the people voted for marijuana and they didn't vote for bans. They didn't vote for
[01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:40.810]  moratoriums. And we have that situation because people just didn't get involved. And so CRRC,
[01:54:41.530 --> 01:54:50.010]  that's the organization that we've started to interface with our government and be a part of
[01:54:50.970 --> 01:54:58.330]  the laws that are going to affect you. So you may as well get involved. Yeah. You can't complain
[01:54:58.330 --> 01:55:02.970]  about the rules if he did not help make them when he had the chance. Yep. I agree with that. Pueblo
[01:55:02.970 --> 01:55:07.770]  City Council did create the marijuana board. They passed that and I've applied to be a- Kudos to
[01:55:07.770 --> 01:55:12.330]  them for that. They really deserve- If you're interested in that- They acted fast on that too.
[01:55:12.330 --> 01:55:16.890]  And you're serious about it. Absolutely. So- Get it, one of us on the show will get you an
[01:55:16.890 --> 01:55:27.210]  application. ... as if they are adversarial to us. The situation is just no one has stepped up to
[01:55:28.890 --> 01:55:39.290]  feel the need for citizen participation. And that's happened. We welcome anyone who wants to
[01:55:39.290 --> 01:55:51.530]  be a part. And again, City Hall, third floor, 7 p.m., Monday the 7th. And you can show up.
[01:55:51.530 --> 01:56:01.530]  We'll have applications for the marijuana board. You can sign up to speak to the council
[01:56:02.410 --> 01:56:10.090]  and get a lot of information and meet some good people. Lots of good people. And if you can come
[01:56:10.090 --> 01:56:15.530]  to the meetings, or even if you can't, come to our event on 727 at the Brickyard in Pueblo,
[01:56:15.530 --> 01:56:19.210]  Colorado. I'll post the address up. We're going to wrap it up. We're about an hour. Does anybody
[01:56:19.210 --> 01:56:23.930]  have any final words? The best thing you can do is show support. I like that, Adam. Get out and
[01:56:23.930 --> 01:56:29.130]  show support. For the amount of credit I give you, sometimes you say some good shit. Yeah,
[01:56:29.210 --> 01:56:33.450]  sometimes. And it doesn't take much effort to make a phone call or send an email to a city
[01:56:33.450 --> 01:56:36.810]  council member. It doesn't at all. And if enough people do that, that's all it really takes. Three
[01:56:36.810 --> 01:56:40.490]  to five minutes out of your day. Exactly. They're hitting the hookah over there and
[01:56:40.490 --> 01:56:47.130]  blowing smoke bubbles. That's how much fun we're having. Wow. Does anybody fear for their safety?
[01:56:47.850 --> 01:56:52.170]  No. Is everybody going to be responsible? You're going to drive home safely? Absolutely. Security
[01:56:52.170 --> 01:56:57.370]  guard's still out front. Everything's good to go. All right. We recorded for a full hour. We've been
[01:56:57.370 --> 01:57:01.690]  here for close to two or three hours. Nobody's gotten crazy, you guys. I want to give everybody
[01:57:01.690 --> 01:57:06.730]  a big shout out for that one. We are the responsible citizens. All right. I want to
[01:57:06.730 --> 01:57:10.250]  thank all the listeners for listening for this long hour and something minutes episode. I want

[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:37.300]  All across the nation. Tell me who got the best, the top shelf extracts. I won't settle for the
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:42.260]  rest. No, gotta be that proper. Give me highest helicopters. Chest thumping like a chaper corp.
[02:00:42.260 --> 02:00:46.740]  And like I need a doctor. Talking slow like a mobster. Leaning low in my chair. Thinking what
[02:00:46.740 --> 02:00:51.940]  should I hit next? Could you high off the air? Dabbing with the judges, extract extraordinaire.
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:56.900]  Don't need tangy to the TI turps. Got them well aware. Highly educated, top notch,
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:01:01.860]  you damn right. We faded, but I still hit it. I ain't scared. Call me Mr. Dabolina.
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:07.860]  Mr. Glide Dabolina. The 91 ISO got the rig looking clean. Grab bar, do it big. Where's
[02:01:07.860 --> 02:01:11.540]  my number? Have you seen it? That's the game of the event and most will never find it.
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:28.020]  I'm
[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:29.220]  everyone's faded.
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:40.420]  A gathering of hands that appreciate the movement. A battle of the best where they discuss how to do
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:45.460]  it. A friendly competition to see who will take the belt. The title of the chain and the number
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:50.580]  one belt. So you think you got that fire? Put your Earl on the line, but don't come looking like
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:55.780]  SF number nine. From the oil to the butter to the tasty proper wax. I love it all.
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:02:00.820]  Crumble, shatter, and a snap from the garden to a lab. First a nug, then a slab. Now it's
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:06.980]  silicone jars. No more zip lock bags. Taking dab after dab because it tastes so good. Taz told me
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:12.740]  let it puddle. Now I got it understood. Let the nail cool down. Slap the carb cap on. Mini rigs,
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:17.700]  e-nails, no more five foot bombs. So many dads, my head's spinning. I'm like, when will it end?
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:20.660]  All snaps, seven, ten. Time to do it again. Come on.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:32.180]  Welcome to the cut. Welcome to the cut. Welcome to the cut. Proud to our sparlers.
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:36.580]  Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up.
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:42.180]  Everyone's faded. Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up.
[02:02:42.180 --> 02:02:46.180]  I see that you're getting it. Can't be a hash, make a bragging without your shadow dragging.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:50.660]  Plenty ride up on the boat. Yeah, but who's going to be the captain? Like emerge when you dabbing.
[02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:56.500]  He man slap snapping. An alien, your wage re-enters. Great and savage. That'll tell you who
[02:02:56.500 --> 02:03:00.820]  stands out from the rest. Don't run your mouth. Run a batch and put it to the test. Yeah, your
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:04.980]  patients would prefer to know whose product is the best. So patience when you purge because
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:09.700]  perfection is the quest. Analyze the analytics. They say numbers never lie. They got me high as
[02:03:09.700 --> 02:03:14.420]  Tyro gymnast flipping blind through the sky. But I'm cool, calm, collected. No, this ain't my first
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:19.780]  ride. The feast will turn an anorexic to a fat guy. If not, fool go do the trick. Yeah, the after
[02:03:19.780 --> 02:03:29.220]  party live. We maps rig rags. H E T. I don't break. This is new age. Dab like 17 4 20. No longer got us high.
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:35.220]  Welcome to the club. Welcome to the club. Welcome to the club. Grabbing towards fire.
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:40.740]  Welcome to the club. Welcome to the club. Welcome to the club. Grabbing towards fire.
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:44.020]  Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up. Dabbing, dabbing up.
[02:04:03.850 --> 02:04:21.850]  Yeah, that's what's up. Welcome to the podcast. Ladies and gentlemen, you know, the show has
[02:04:21.850 --> 02:04:26.410]  started when Jeff is coughing his lungs out. How are you guys doing tonight? Welcome to the
[02:04:26.410 --> 02:04:31.450]  agriculture podcast. Episode number 19. It's great to be with you. I promise it is good to
[02:04:31.450 --> 02:04:35.130]  be with you. It may not sound like I'm having fun. Some dying from a dab here in just a minute.
[02:04:35.130 --> 02:04:39.610]  We're going to get a party started. It's a rainy day here in Colorado. I'm hanging out,
[02:04:39.610 --> 02:04:43.850]  relaxing, listening to the sound of the rain and thunder. Been wondering what to put on the show.
[02:04:44.810 --> 02:04:48.170]  It's been a few days since I put out an episode and I messed up the rhythm by putting out a show
[02:04:48.170 --> 02:04:52.170]  on Saturday, but I'm back on schedule with number 19. Thanks for joining me.
[02:04:54.890 --> 02:04:59.770]  Gosh, I think I've recovered from that dab. Last night, I went to the 710 Cup awards ceremony in
[02:04:59.770 --> 02:05:07.050]  Denver. The 710 Cup is a hash festival. It's kind of a competition. There were about 50 entries in
[02:05:07.050 --> 02:05:12.650]  the hash contest. What they do is the hash makers enter their hash, already their concentrate,
[02:05:12.650 --> 02:05:17.770]  already broken down into small samples. So I think there were 50 contestants, which means
[02:05:17.770 --> 02:05:24.490]  they had to turn in 50 samples. Those entries are then assigned a number and they make a little kit
[02:05:24.490 --> 02:05:30.250]  for each of the judges. So you're given a little, like a pencil box full of samples labeled one
[02:05:30.250 --> 02:05:34.970]  through 50. And you basically go through and you spend a couple of days smoking each sample and you
[02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:41.370]  judge them by flavor, texture, appearance. There's a nice little list of things that we judge them on.
[02:05:41.370 --> 02:05:45.450]  I was not part of the judging this year. I did it last year. This year, I did not do any of the
[02:05:45.450 --> 02:05:50.330]  judging. But you go and you judge all the stuff and then you turn in your judging, all your
[02:05:50.330 --> 02:05:55.530]  paperwork. And then on Saturday night, last night, they announced all of the winners. And they do it
[02:05:55.530 --> 02:06:02.170]  by numbers to keep it anonymous. So that way nobody knows which sample is which. So I did not attend
[02:06:02.170 --> 02:06:07.210]  the Friday or Saturday portions of the event. I was only able to make it up to the awards ceremony
[02:06:07.210 --> 02:06:12.650]  at Coyotes on Saturday night. But that part was tons of fun. The party kicked off with a
[02:06:12.650 --> 02:06:18.010]  marijuana comedian. I was a little dabbed out and distracted by conversation when they introduced
[02:06:18.010 --> 02:06:22.490]  him. So I did not catch his name. And I honestly didn't pay too much attention to most of his set.
[02:06:22.490 --> 02:06:26.570]  I had bumped into a bunch of friends I hadn't seen in a while. We kind of got into conversation. I
[02:06:26.570 --> 02:06:30.330]  apologized to the comedian for not paying any attention. I feel a little rude about that. But
[02:06:30.330 --> 02:06:35.210]  you know what? I was there for a party. So after the comedian, there was an award ceremony where
[02:06:35.210 --> 02:06:40.730]  Sean Tran took home most of the awards. We'll go over a full list of the award winners just a little
[02:06:40.730 --> 02:06:45.210]  bit. So there's a funky jam band that played a Grateful Dead cover that I really appreciated.
[02:06:45.850 --> 02:06:49.530]  They played a version of Shakedown Street that I thought was pretty damn awesome.
[02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:55.290]  I get to visit with a bunch of friends that I only see at 420 or 710 events. And to top it all off,
[02:06:55.290 --> 02:07:00.570]  I stuck around to hear a few songs from old school rapper Slick Rick. Dude, Slick Rick was wearing
[02:07:00.570 --> 02:07:06.090]  more gold than I've ever seen. I've seen full rap groups not wearing as much gold and bling as Slick
[02:07:06.090 --> 02:07:12.170]  Rick had. If you could get a diamond and gold watch he had, his rings were bigger than most
[02:07:12.170 --> 02:07:19.690]  people's pendants. He had the links in his gold chains were more gold than most people's gold
[02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:26.730]  chains. That dude was bling the fuck out. So I'm gonna give a big shout out, big 710 style shout
[02:07:26.730 --> 02:07:31.930]  out to my buddy Kevin. He saved me a really prime seat to sit in, a spot in which to sit. I don't
[02:07:31.930 --> 02:07:36.090]  know the proper grammar there. Kevin saved me a fucking killer seat. Thanks, bro. Big shout out
[02:07:36.090 --> 02:07:40.730]  to Josh and Jeff from La Plata Labs. Also a shout out to Lenny Lane for bringing the killer solvent
[02:07:40.730 --> 02:07:44.490]  list. That was tasty, bro. Thank you. And thanks for the good conversation about breeding.
[02:07:44.490 --> 02:07:48.810]  That conversation is not done. We have to finish that conversation or continue it at least.
[02:07:49.530 --> 02:07:54.890]  Also a big shout out to Jay Dizzle for the super tasty and ultra smooth dab, that dabachino with
[02:07:54.890 --> 02:08:00.090]  the e-nail on it. That is fucking stylish and it hits like a boss. So thank you. Also a big shout
[02:08:00.090 --> 02:08:04.330]  out to Ruga from Grassroots for throwing and hosting the party. The award ceremony went fairly
[02:08:04.330 --> 02:08:11.050]  smoothly. It was just ran by Mike Froh and Ryan Ruga Connelly from Grassroots and they did a hell
[02:08:11.050 --> 02:08:16.650]  of a job. So I also want to give a big shout out to Big D. D was given a lifetime achievement award
[02:08:16.650 --> 02:08:23.050]  from the 710 community. It was great to see somebody honor Dan for his dedication and his
[02:08:23.050 --> 02:08:26.890]  work in the community and not just for his hash making skills. He's received plenty of awards for
[02:08:26.890 --> 02:08:31.290]  that. It was good to see him get an award just for being a good dude. That was well overdue.
[02:08:32.250 --> 02:08:37.290]  The part of the event I saw was great. During one of Slick Rick's songs, the whole sound system
[02:08:37.290 --> 02:08:41.290]  went dead for a couple of minutes and they had to figure out what went wrong to get the show
[02:08:41.290 --> 02:08:44.970]  started again. So I was kind of curious how, you know, he's kind of a superstar. I was kind of
[02:08:44.970 --> 02:08:48.650]  curious how he would handle it, but he just waited it out. He stood on stage and kind of cooled down
[02:08:48.650 --> 02:08:51.290]  because it was hot in there. I think he took a minute to catch his breath and cool down.
[02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:57.770]  Then they carried on with the show, but it was hot in there. So after that first band played,
[02:08:57.770 --> 02:09:01.450]  it got really hot. By the time Slick Rick came up, it was way too hot for me.
[02:09:02.330 --> 02:09:07.530]  So after a couple of his songs, I took a final dab and I headed out and that was mostly my 710 cup
[02:09:07.530 --> 02:09:13.450]  experience. I said, we do a rundown of the winners. Let me scroll over to that right quick.
[02:09:13.450 --> 02:09:18.010]  Here's a quick rundown. I guess a quick rundown would be a Sean Tran fucking cleaned house. Sean
[02:09:18.010 --> 02:09:22.890]  Tran won everything, not everything, but like most of it was just Sean Tran. He walked away with a
[02:09:22.890 --> 02:09:29.290]  handsome check. You got a sweet custom made rig from Mike fro. He had two grassroots hat deals.
[02:09:29.930 --> 02:09:34.490]  He got a vape pen. He got enough goodies to fill a suitcase. And then they also handed him a bunch
[02:09:34.490 --> 02:09:42.570]  of gift cards. So big shout out to Sean Tran. Here are the official results of the 2014 710 cup. This
[02:09:42.570 --> 02:09:47.210]  is from their Facebook page. Let me scroll to it. All right. Starting at the bottom of the list,
[02:09:47.210 --> 02:09:52.170]  best taste went to advanced medical alternatives with entry number 20 Durban poison.

[02:11:15.530 --> 02:11:22.330]  a dab of that one. A lot of the dabs I tasted were jilly bean heavy in my opinion. And we'll
[02:11:22.330 --> 02:11:26.090]  get to that here in just a second. We'll talk more about that. Where was I sativa shatter

[02:11:34.810 --> 02:11:41.610]  alternatives with entry number 20 the Durban poison indica wax third place God's green earth
[02:11:42.570 --> 02:11:48.250]  second place growing minds and first place indica wax advanced medical alternatives with entry
[02:11:48.250 --> 02:11:54.010]  number 13. Oh gee, cush. Oh gee Bubba Cush and strawberry cough that sounds like a delicious
[02:11:54.090 --> 02:12:03.130]  entry. Let's see sativa shatter third place God's green earth. Second place steel rolling and first
[02:12:03.130 --> 02:12:11.930]  place the health center with entry number 37. Pre jilly. Let's see indica shatter third place
[02:12:11.930 --> 02:12:20.010]  native roots extracts second place kind bill a cut above and first place in indica shatter category
[02:12:20.010 --> 02:12:26.970]  was infusions entry number one which was blueberry plus grape ape. These are pluses not
[02:12:26.970 --> 02:12:32.650]  times so these are not bred together. These are two strains that were blended together.
[02:12:32.650 --> 02:12:37.770]  They're blends not crosses is what I think I'm trying to say. So there were two special awards
[02:12:37.770 --> 02:12:44.410]  for the 2014 710 cup. One of the awards was the people's choice award and guess who that one went
[02:12:44.410 --> 02:12:50.250]  to that went to the health center which is Sean Tron once again with number 37 the pre jilly
[02:12:50.890 --> 02:12:56.810]  and then drumroll please first place overall you may be able to predict this one. It went to guess
[02:12:56.810 --> 02:13:02.490]  who Sean Tron once again with the health center number 37 pre jilly so I'm going to count them
[02:13:02.490 --> 02:13:15.450]  there's one two three four five five winning that I see six six wins from Sean Tron and the health
[02:13:15.450 --> 02:13:22.730]  center there out of one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve categories
[02:13:22.730 --> 02:13:27.850]  Sean Tron took six of them so congrats bro I don't know if you listen to the podcast or not
[02:13:27.850 --> 02:13:34.170]  but I hope you do and dude congratulations I got to taste your entry when I hit it I said right
[02:13:34.170 --> 02:13:39.770]  away there's some jilly bean in there because I'm a fan of the jilly bean strain so a big shout out
[02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:45.370]  to big shout out to sub cool and miss Jill for making the jilly bean I guess we should say and
[02:13:45.370 --> 02:13:51.850]  big big love to the health center the grow team there and fucking super killer job to Sean Tron
[02:13:51.850 --> 02:13:57.290]  and once again much respect to Ryan from grassroots for throwing the competition that's really cool of
[02:13:57.290 --> 02:14:01.850]  them to do there was a scare that the competition was not going to happen this year and I'm glad
[02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:05.370]  that they pulled it together and made it happen oh I apologize I'm getting a Facebook message I'm

[02:15:53.290 --> 02:15:58.570]  of my favorite glass pieces on I got a couple of my favorite glass rigs on the oil slick pad I've
[02:15:58.570 --> 02:16:03.850]  got a carb cap on there I've got my favorite concentrate sitting on the oil slick pad I know
[02:16:03.850 --> 02:16:07.850]  that my concentrates not going to stick to the oil slick pad I know that I'm not going to leave a
[02:16:07.850 --> 02:16:13.050]  bunch of sticky rings on my table it's a place to keep my stuff kind of organized it's a nice
[02:16:13.050 --> 02:16:17.050]  little dedicated spot is what I feel like and also you hear this sound right here I don't know if you
[02:16:17.050 --> 02:16:22.010]  can hear it that's a rig hitting a table that's just sitting a rig down on a table here's a rig
[02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:27.290]  sitting down on a slick pad they made a little noise because I set it down really hard it was
[02:16:27.290 --> 02:16:32.170]  out of my reach but I mean did it I'd much rather set it on the oil slick pad than the wooden table
[02:16:32.170 --> 02:16:37.130]  it just feels a little better for my rig one side sticks to the table real well so it won't slide
[02:16:37.130 --> 02:16:42.010]  around then the other side is nice and nice and soft and your dabs won't stick to it just get
[02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:45.770]  yourself an oil slick pad also quit carrying your hash around and fold it up parchment paper
[02:16:46.410 --> 02:16:51.050]  that doesn't look classy at all bro get yourself a oil slick container they make them in every
[02:16:51.050 --> 02:16:56.410]  color so have some class get some oil slick products step up the game a little bit all right
[02:16:56.410 --> 02:17:01.050]  guys feels like I need a dab so I'm gonna take a quick dab and we will work our way into a little
[02:17:01.130 --> 02:17:07.530]  bit of news hang tight for just a minute all right guys I'm back on the microphone after way too many
[02:17:07.530 --> 02:17:12.570]  fat dabs speaking of way too many fat dabs I want to recommend another podcast I think you guys
[02:17:12.570 --> 02:17:17.850]  should be listening to the Adam Dunn show I know it seems weird that I'm advertising another podcast
[02:17:17.850 --> 02:17:22.650]  that may be considered a competitor but I don't see that as a competition in any way at all I
[02:17:22.650 --> 02:17:28.090]  would be doing you a disservice if I did not recommend the Adam Dunn show specifically go
[02:17:28.090 --> 02:17:33.210]  back and listen to the all about dabs episode two and three and really pay attention to what those
[02:17:33.210 --> 02:17:38.410]  guys are talking about about what we're doing to ourselves health-wise with dabs some of that stuff
[02:17:38.410 --> 02:17:44.010]  may be interesting to you it may reduce your dab intake I'm known for taking some fucking huge dabs
[02:17:44.010 --> 02:17:49.690]  for being for being a dab monster for loving loving to take a lot of dabs that episode has
[02:17:49.690 --> 02:17:56.890]  changed my dab intake and my approach to dabbing a little bit those two episodes I'm not paranoid
[02:17:56.890 --> 02:18:00.490]  or anything I'm just more conscious and I think that we should all be a little bit aware of what
[02:18:00.490 --> 02:18:04.090]  we're doing to our bodies and what we are potentially doing to ourselves I'm not trying to
[02:18:04.090 --> 02:18:09.450]  scare you but listen to the all about dabbing episodes of the Adam Dunn show big shout out to
[02:18:09.450 --> 02:18:16.090]  Adam Dunn I kind of saw him from across the room at the 710 event last night and he was the guy
[02:18:16.810 --> 02:18:23.050]  wearing the shirt with his face on his own shirt so shout out Adam Dunn shout out to Mitch Shinasa
[02:18:23.050 --> 02:18:26.570]  all the guys that help out on that show all the people that are the guests on the episodes I
[02:18:26.570 --> 02:18:30.170]  talked about listen to that that's good shit that's enough ranting about that so let's get
[02:18:30.170 --> 02:18:35.050]  into some news where do you want to start let's start here at home in Colorado Colorado
[02:18:35.050 --> 02:18:40.730]  you're a bunch of fucking potheads dude this one comes from the Denver Post written by John
[02:18:40.730 --> 02:18:46.650]  Engle published July 9th so we're a little bit late but here we are Colorado study pegs annual
[02:18:47.290 --> 02:18:57.050]  at 130 metric tons god damn you smoke a lot of weed Colorado a state-produced study has concluded
[02:18:57.050 --> 02:19:02.250]  that high taxes and fewer stores are keeping Colorado medical marijuana consumers from
[02:19:02.250 --> 02:19:07.930]  switching to the recreational cannabis market a trend that if continues will have a major impact
[02:19:07.930 --> 02:19:13.450]  on the state's predicted marijuana tax windfall the study released Wednesday found that out-of-state
[02:19:13.450 --> 02:19:18.570]  visitors make up nearly half of the recreational marijuana sales in the Denver area and 90 percent
[02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:22.890]  of recreational sales in mountain resort communities tourists though account for only
[02:19:22.890 --> 02:19:28.090]  about seven percent of the annual demand for marijuana in the state which the study estimates
[02:19:28.090 --> 02:19:37.690]  at 130.3 metric tons that's a lot of weed dude I can't even fathom 130.3 metric tons
[02:19:38.650 --> 02:19:45.850]  I was in Denver excuse me I got a dab cough going on I was in Denver driving yesterday for that 710
[02:19:45.850 --> 02:19:51.930]  cup and I passed uh passed a dispensary that's right there in downtown Denver and there were a
[02:19:51.930 --> 02:19:55.930]  group of people that were obviously from out of state because they were gathered in front of the
[02:19:55.930 --> 02:20:00.250]  sign of the dispensary and they were taking turns taking picture of each other throwing their their
[02:20:00.250 --> 02:20:05.770]  local gang sign up in front of the dispensary sign I found it entertaining I take it for granted we
[02:20:05.770 --> 02:20:11.690]  here in Colorado we forgot like we just go to the weed store buy some weed or we don't most of us
[02:20:11.690 --> 02:20:17.290]  are probably growing our own by now they said that 50 percent of the recreational sales is from people
[02:20:17.290 --> 02:20:21.770]  from out of state my buddy Kev that's on the show sometimes he works at a shop he says most of the
[02:20:21.770 --> 02:20:27.770]  people are from Texas so most of that's gone to Texas it sounds like one quarter at a time
[02:20:28.570 --> 02:20:33.930]  so I'll continue with the article the study finds total marijuana demand to be much larger than
[02:20:33.930 --> 02:20:40.250]  previously estimated the study's author right in their report the reason the authors conclude is
[02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:45.370]  that previous studies have underestimated the level of demand from heavy users the new study
[02:20:45.370 --> 02:20:51.850]  finds that the top 22 percent of marijuana users in Colorado account for nearly 67 percent of the
[02:20:51.850 --> 02:20:59.690]  total demand the bottom 54 percent users account for only about four percent of demand my lips are
[02:20:59.690 --> 02:21:04.730]  all sticky you guys can hear it that's from the big fat dab I took uh think about that if my lips
[02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:09.290]  are sticky how far down to that sticky shit get is that all in my throat is that all in my lungs
[02:21:09.850 --> 02:21:12.810]  because I felt it on my teeth the other night and that kind of freaked me out it made me start
[02:21:12.810 --> 02:21:19.050]  thinking about this that's just a weird random side note so this just said 22 percent of marijuana
[02:21:19.050 --> 02:21:26.410]  users in Colorado account for nearly 67 percent of the total demand I'm not a mathematician or a
[02:21:26.410 --> 02:21:33.130]  math magician but 20 if there's 100 people smoking all this weed 22 of them are smoking 67
[02:21:33.130 --> 02:21:39.050]  percent all that weed that's funny to me there's some serious hardcore potheads or are there people
[02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:44.170]  doing what we call the dispensary flip are they going and getting their outs then are they taking
[02:21:44.170 --> 02:21:48.730]  it around and doing what they can do I don't even want to encourage or talk about that but a lot of
[02:21:48.730 --> 02:21:54.330]  that is probably that unfortunately the prevalence of heavy users in Colorado is higher than the
[02:21:54.330 --> 02:21:59.770]  national average the authors right so it says the department feels it is important to understand
[02:21:59.770 --> 02:22:04.330]  marijuana usage and the demand in the state to effectively manage production within the regulated
[02:22:04.330 --> 02:22:09.530]  industry Colorado Department of Revenue Executive Director Barbara Burrell said in a statement
[02:22:09.530 --> 02:22:15.770]  the marijuana enforcement division said it used survey results demographic data research literature
[02:22:15.770 --> 02:22:21.370]  and Colorado specific specific primary source data to compile the study I'm kind of curious
[02:22:21.370 --> 02:22:26.330]  because they don't uh they're not supposed to be taking our information when we go in we show
[02:22:26.330 --> 02:22:31.370]  them our id at these rec shops but they don't photocopy your id they're not supposed to be
[02:22:31.370 --> 02:22:36.250]  taking any notes on who's in there so I'm a little curious where this data came from I'd like to uh
[02:22:36.250 --> 02:22:42.490]  find out more about that if anybody's listening that has input on how they got that info if you
[02:22:42.490 --> 02:22:48.410]  have input on how they got that info tweet me message me uh at igrowculture on twitter uh
[02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:53.850]  igrowculture on facebook or igrowculture at hotmail.com if you want to email me along stuff
[02:22:55.290 --> 02:22:58.090]  I would appreciate it because I want to know where they got that they're not supposed to be
[02:22:58.090 --> 02:23:04.730]  copying our data Colorado specific primary source data uh kind of weird here anyway among the most
[02:23:04.730 --> 02:23:09.210]  significant conclusions listed in the report few people are switching from shopping at medical
[02:23:09.210 --> 02:23:13.850]  marijuana dispensaries to shopping at recreational marijuana stores well no shit it's more expensive
[02:23:13.850 --> 02:23:19.930]  there the study concludes that uh the study concludes that could be because of higher taxes
[02:23:19.930 --> 02:23:24.330]  for recreational marijuana and fewer available outlets discouraging switching well no shit you
[02:23:24.330 --> 02:23:29.450]  charge us 25 percent extra a Colorado resident is just going to go and get their card it costs you
[02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:34.730]  100 bucks one time yeah get your red card and save all that money to save all the money like
[02:23:34.730 --> 02:23:39.450]  if you shop twice the cost of the doctor and then every time you go after that is just a bonus
[02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:44.730]  so the retail demand is derived primarily from out-of-state visitors and from customers who
[02:23:44.730 --> 02:23:48.810]  previously purchased from the Colorado black and gray markets the studies authors right
[02:23:49.610 --> 02:23:53.610]  the trend though has major implications for the state's marijuana tax revenue
[02:23:53.610 --> 02:23:59.850]  predictions for revenue from the recreational marijuana tax once reached as high as 35 million
[02:23:59.850 --> 02:24:06.250]  dollars for the first six months of 2014 instead including numbers released Wednesday for May tax
[02:24:06.250 --> 02:24:12.890]  collections the state has brought in only about 14.7 million so far the summer's here I bet we're
[02:24:12.890 --> 02:24:18.490]  gonna increase that number through the summer and April probably boosted them up and got them all
[02:24:18.490 --> 02:24:23.930]  excited because I mean but a lot of weed for 420. So medical marijuana sales meanwhile continued to
[02:24:23.930 --> 02:24:30.090]  outpace recreational sales through May medical marijuana dispensaries had done nearly 165 million
[02:24:30.090 --> 02:24:34.970]  dollars of sales compared with the 90 million dollars from recreational stores tax revenue
[02:24:34.970 --> 02:24:40.410]  from medical marijuana sales though has amounted to slightly less than 5 million creating a system
[02:24:40.410 --> 02:24:45.130]  where people who are using cannabis medically can access their medicine without paying higher taxes
[02:24:45.130 --> 02:24:51.450]  is not a bad thing said Taylor West a spokeswoman for the National Cannabis Industry Association
[02:24:52.490 --> 02:24:57.130]  the story was from the Denver Post let me go find another related article there's a link here
[02:24:57.130 --> 02:25:04.330]  I think I just got to go back yeah they talk about 130 metric tons of pot how heavy is that
[02:25:04.970 --> 02:25:10.410]  state of Colorado estimates that its annual demand for marijuana is 130.3 metric tons but
[02:25:10.410 --> 02:25:21.210]  how heavy is 130 metric tons anyway it's the equivalent of 287,259 pounds does that make it
[02:25:21.210 --> 02:25:26.490]  any more clear to you me neither that's also such a mammoth number that context doesn't come
[02:25:26.490 --> 02:25:31.210]  naturally but thankfully the cannabis crackpot data team is here for you Colorado's annual
[02:25:31.210 --> 02:25:36.490]  marijuana demand is heavier than a space shuttle or a blue whale but not quite as heavy as a
[02:25:36.490 --> 02:25:42.730]  locomotive so yes it's a lot of weed how heavy is 130 metric tons they've given us a little graph
[02:25:42.730 --> 02:25:52.650]  here a hippopotamus weighs about 3,300 pounds that big ugly mustang dia sculpture that weighs
[02:25:52.650 --> 02:26:01.290]  9,000 pounds a school bus weighs 25,000 pounds a bulldozer weighs 7,000 pounds a b2 bomber
[02:26:01.850 --> 02:26:16.570]  is 185,000 pounds a blue whale is 250,000 pounds annual estimated Colorado marijuana demand 287,259

[02:26:47.290 --> 02:26:52.810]  dispensaries now this article is also by ricardo baca thanks for writing all these articles and
[02:26:52.810 --> 02:26:58.010]  making it easy for me to do my news stuff there are a lot of great news sources out there but
[02:26:58.010 --> 02:27:03.610]  the cannabis is always reliable they're here in colorado so quick shout out to the cannabis this
[02:27:03.610 --> 02:27:09.210]  article headline is the washington shop this washington shop served over 1,000 grams of pot
[02:27:09.210 --> 02:27:16.730]  to 400 buyers in four hours goes like this thomas beckley and john evic i'm guessing on that were on
[02:27:16.730 --> 02:27:21.930]  cloud nine when we spoke with them on the morning of july 8th an unbelievably bustling cloud nine
[02:27:21.930 --> 02:27:27.930]  with electricity in the air and cash in the registers we've had about 400 people in four
[02:27:27.930 --> 02:27:33.130]  hours said beckley an owner at top shelf cannabis in bellingham washington we opened at exactly 8
[02:27:33.130 --> 02:27:37.530]  a.m and through the news we saw that we were the first shop to open in the state of washington
[02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:44.010]  congratulations guys proud of you i'm pretty stoked said the owner of top shelf i'm not going
[02:27:44.010 --> 02:27:46.810]  to murder your name again i apologize for doing that i'm not good with these names
[02:27:47.370 --> 02:27:52.890]  uh this is so new and we're lucky just to get open and that was a huge task right now traffic
[02:27:52.890 --> 02:27:58.090]  is flowing smoothly and we're thankful for that top shelf served around a thousand grams of legal
[02:27:58.090 --> 02:28:03.530]  retail marijuana to more than 400 customers in the first four hours of business on july 8th
[02:28:03.530 --> 02:28:08.330]  beckley said after referencing his in-house tracking system since the shop's median per
[02:28:08.330 --> 02:28:17.450]  gram price is 12.50 that makes for roughly 12 500 in sales for those four hours or about three
[02:28:17.450 --> 02:28:26.840]  thousand dollars per hour the line right now has dwindled down a little bit beckley said
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:31.480]  tonight when everybody's off work i think it'll be twice as much as it was earlier the top shelf
[02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:35.880]  owners made international news earlier this week when they talked publicly about using about
[02:28:35.880 --> 02:28:40.280]  possibly using one of their crab boats or renting a helicopter to transport their marijuana stock
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:45.160]  from bremerton to bellingham to expedite the process of finally opening their doors for their
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:50.600]  first legal retail sale that grand and elaborate plan didn't work out we ended up not using it
[02:28:50.600 --> 02:28:54.920]  because we ran into some aviation rules and we couldn't go on the water because of the coast guard
[02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:59.960]  beckley said the faa and the coast guard told us they wouldn't recommend trying it oh i bet these
[02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:04.040]  guys would have gotten their whole stock taken from them that would have been shitty it would
[02:29:04.040 --> 02:29:08.520]  have been funny and shitty at the same time it would have been like a movie so anyway one of the
[02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:13.960]  owners i can't say his name properly evic evic attributed their smooth launch on july 8th to a
[02:29:13.960 --> 02:29:18.280]  couple factors including his request for a smaller manifest for their weed delivery which allowed
[02:29:18.280 --> 02:29:23.560]  them to count 50 something bags of marijuana before starting sales instead of counting 2200
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:30.280]  the shop's biotrack thc point of sale equipment and software even given all the excitement
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:35.000]  tuesday morning top shelf cannabis actually opened its doors a few minutes after 8 a.m
[02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:39.880]  our door opened at 803 a.m he said because complying and working with the state is the
[02:29:39.880 --> 02:29:45.080]  number one priority even over customer service which yeah that's got to be the truth so they
[02:29:45.080 --> 02:29:52.360]  have their washington stores are open so anybody uh i think 21 and over can go buy cannabis there
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:57.480]  i was looking at a few other articles the price per gram there uh you're looking at paying between
[02:29:57.480 --> 02:30:02.680]  15 and 25 dollars a gram just depending on what strain and what shop some of the top shelf stuff
[02:30:03.320 --> 02:30:08.440]  it seemed like the trend was that a lot of these shops were selling two gram packages so you're
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:13.320]  getting two grams of the same strain uh and it was already sealed they didn't get to look at it
[02:30:14.120 --> 02:30:18.600]  they've got a jar on the shelf there like they've got their several jars i'm just going to make up
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:22.920]  names they got headband they got sour diesel they got bubba kush on the in jars they probably had
[02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:26.440]  six or seven eight or ten strains lined up in jars you can look at those and you're like i want the
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:31.640]  sour diesel and they give you a pre-weighed bag of sour diesel that was two grams and it was costing
[02:30:31.640 --> 02:30:37.960]  about 45 plus tax uh or about 40 plus tax in a lot of places so it just depends on where you went
[02:30:38.840 --> 02:30:42.120]  and what strain you were looking for i'm looking for more information on uh
[02:30:43.080 --> 02:30:50.440]  yeah pre-tax was 29.92 post-tax was 40 and that was the price for two grams of a strain called
[02:30:50.440 --> 02:30:55.080]  sweet lafayette i'm going to scroll down there are pictures of some people's tweets
[02:30:56.040 --> 02:31:05.240]  uh 13 a gram at this spot uh 25 to 27 for uh two grams at this place now here's what one of the
[02:31:05.240 --> 02:31:11.160]  first customers bought a two gram package uh cost them 40 plus tax they don't have a picture of the
[02:31:11.160 --> 02:31:19.240]  receipt on here uh with taxes it looks like two gram bags were coming to 54 so that's a little bit
[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:23.960]  pricey hopefully it'll come down but you know there's nothing encouraging them to lower their
[02:31:23.960 --> 02:31:28.120]  prices they're selling plenty of weed already so it's probably going to stay like that for a little
[02:31:28.120 --> 02:31:32.760]  while so i've got a couple more stories coming from washington since they just uh launched their
[02:31:32.760 --> 02:31:38.280]  shops uh this one's kind of entertaining uh it says seattle's city attorney bought weed for his
[02:31:38.280 --> 02:31:43.720]  enjoyment denver's did not uh when seattle's lone recreational pot shop cannabis city opened its
[02:31:43.720 --> 02:31:48.680]  doors on july 8th seattle city attorney pete holmes was fourth in line and no not the pete
[02:31:48.680 --> 02:31:52.520]  holmes you're thinking this is not the comedian not the guy with the big funny teeth that had the
[02:31:52.520 --> 02:31:59.400]  tv show not him yes he bought some marijuana for posterity but he also bought some for personal
[02:31:59.400 --> 02:32:06.040]  enjoyment pretty bold holmes that's funny because this guy just wrote the phrase pretty bold holmes
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:11.800]  and it sounds like he's being a gangster pretty bold holmes but anyway the most important takeaway
[02:32:11.800 --> 02:32:16.840]  here is that today marijuana sales became legal and i'm here to personally exercise myself this
[02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:23.160]  new freedom holmes told media on tuesday i bought two two gram bags of og pearl which was recommended
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:27.160]  i'm keeping one bag for posterity and one bag for personal enjoyment at some point when it's
[02:32:27.160 --> 02:32:30.840]  appropriate so this dude just admitted he's gonna puff down two grams that's pretty nice
[02:32:31.400 --> 02:32:35.960]  hopefully he shares with a good friend and they have a good laugh uh customer vivian mcpeake who
[02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:41.960]  happens to be the executive director of seattle hemp fest said he was proud of his city attorney
[02:32:42.680 --> 02:32:48.360]  i'm inherently proud of our city attorney i'm inherently proud our city attorney has played a
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:53.720]  groundbreaking role in making this happen this shift in public policy mcpeake told a reporter
[02:32:53.720 --> 02:32:58.760]  he's backing up his words and is going to take some big nice long deep tokes at home i think it's
[02:32:58.760 --> 02:33:04.920]  all right holmes bold move got us wondering did denver city attorney scott martinez buy any marijuana
[02:33:04.920 --> 02:33:11.000]  personal or professional reasons on january 1st have i bought any no i have not bought any on january
[02:33:11.000 --> 02:33:16.200]  1st or since then martinez told the cannabis on july 8th oh by the way i didn't mention this article
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:20.600]  comes once again from the cannabis thank you uh but i do know pete their city attorney is elected
[02:33:20.600 --> 02:33:25.720]  and he campaigned on the issue martinez's point is straightforward while he was appointed city
[02:33:25.720 --> 02:33:31.320]  attorney by denver mayor michael hancock holmes was elected by the people of seattle as an elected
[02:33:31.320 --> 02:33:36.360]  official he certainly has a different well he's an elected official so i wouldn't comment on what
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:41.400]  his path is martinez said but we both have an obligation to uphold the law and i know what an
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:46.520]  important job it is and wish him the best as he goes forward in this new time for seattle and
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:51.560]  washington martinez said holmes had visited colorado and has seen legal recreational marijuana
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:57.480]  industry in action previous to washington's opening day of retail sales on july 8th we certainly share
[02:33:57.480 --> 02:34:01.960]  information because it's important to share best practices especially as we're on the forefront of
[02:34:01.960 --> 02:34:07.720]  a unique legal issue martinez said he's a smart guy well educated he's got a big job ahead of him
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:10.280]  we're going to continue that sharing of information
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:19.000]  so the city attorney bought some pot right and then i gotta scroll back because right after that
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:26.920]  there was another article that came out and the headline is and i'm sorry i'm going slow here my
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:32.280]  internet is slow right here right now it says no pot allowed at the office seattle city attorney
[02:34:32.840 --> 02:34:39.240]  cops to breaking the rule so seattle city attorney pete holmes admitted he broke a drug-free workplace
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:43.400]  rule when he brought marijuana on the first day when he bought marijuana on the first day of legal
[02:34:43.400 --> 02:34:47.880]  sales in washington state holmes has been a big supporter of the legal marijuana law and he says
[02:34:47.880 --> 02:34:51.800]  he wanted to be one of the first customers in seattle's cannabis city on tuesday to honor what
[02:34:51.800 --> 02:34:57.640]  he called a tectonic shift in policy he says he then bought the two he brought the two unopened
[02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:03.080]  packages back to city hall before taking them home the next day the city's personnel department
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:07.240]  issued a memo reminding employees they can't have marijuana they're on when they're on official
[02:35:07.240 --> 02:35:12.280]  business or at city offices homes issued an apology friday and city volunteered to donate
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:16.920]  three thousand dollars to the downtown emergency service center an organization that provides
[02:35:16.920 --> 02:35:23.080]  housing for alcohol alcoholic mentally ill or otherwise vulnerable people so that turned into
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:29.560]  an expensive ass two grams of weed for city attorney pete holmes man there's a picture of
[02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:34.680]  him here shaking hands with the clerk from uh cannabis city and he's got a big old uh grin on
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:40.920]  his face looking looking at the weed like huh weed everyone's smiling at him like that's the city
[02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:46.680]  attorney one guy's not sure what to think he's like can he arrest me kind of funny so even the
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:51.000]  city attorney kind of fucked up he bought his weed and he took it right to the office he was proud he
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:35:55.960]  didn't know what to do with it you walk around with your new bag all excited so there's another
[02:35:55.960 --> 02:36:04.680]  article related to the washington cannabis the only pot shop in seattle sells out 11 pounds of
[02:36:04.680 --> 02:36:12.520]  marijuana are gone in three days with taxes the shop's pre-packaged two gram bags sold for 46.77
[02:36:13.400 --> 02:36:19.960]  San Francisco this article is actually from Allison Vection from Bloomberg News
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:26.600]  Seattle pot shop cannabis city the only licensed marijuana retailer in Washington's largest city
[02:36:26.600 --> 02:36:32.440]  ran out of stock on the third day of state approved sales its owner said the store one of 25 licensed
[02:36:32.440 --> 02:36:39.160]  statewide this week had 11 pounds which is 4,990 grams of pot when it opened july 8th and it sold
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:46.120]  out around 5 p.m local time thursday owner James Lathrop Lathrop sorry i fuck up last name so bad
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:55.560]  i apologize uh James said with taxes two gram bags sold for 46.77 we knew it was coming we didn't
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:37:01.960]  have any guaranteed additional deliveries according to the associated press this guy doesn't expect to
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:08.600]  get more supply for 10 to 15 days Washington home to amazon.com Microsoft and Starbucks became the
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:13.480]  second state after Colorado to permit the sale of marijuana for recreational use voters in both
[02:37:13.480 --> 02:37:18.520]  states approved the ballot initiatives in 2012 and Colorado retailers began sales in January
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:23.960]  this guy said growers didn't receive licenses in time to produce enough marijuana for the store's
[02:37:23.960 --> 02:37:28.920]  opening this week the plants take three to four months to mature he said Washington issued 90
[02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:34.120]  licenses to pot growers and processors as of last week according to Brian Smith a spokesman
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:39.080]  for the Washington state liquor control board an agency charged with regulatory regulating the
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:44.760]  industry so they didn't get their grows set up in time and they had to open up and guess what not
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:52.840]  enough reefer uh welcome to the pot world and who the fuck opens up a store with 11 pounds that's
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:59.160]  that's small talk like any hustler should move through 11 pounds in a week what are you doing
[02:37:59.800 --> 02:38:04.760]  okay so they're sold out of weed at some places and they're saying right here that two grams was
[02:38:04.760 --> 02:38:11.480]  going for 46 dollars and 77 cents that's a little pricey uh all right i've got one more little uh
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:16.440]  piece of news that comes from Washington uh they put out a uh press release thing there was a whole
[02:38:16.440 --> 02:38:21.640]  bunch of answers to Washington weed sales six questions answered there's one question that I
[02:38:21.640 --> 02:38:26.440]  found interesting that I could share with you guys it says how much can I buy and this is Washington
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:32.760]  keep that in mind because the laws are different in Colorado I found this interesting because uh in
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:37.640]  Colorado they forgot to write this law and so now they're trying to figure this out now and in
[02:38:37.640 --> 02:38:42.280]  Washington uh they put it in there correctly at the beginning so it says how much can I buy
[02:38:42.920 --> 02:38:49.880]  state law allows the sale of up to an ounce of dried marijuana 16 ounces of pot infused solids
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:55.080]  72 ounces of pot infused liquids which would be tinctures or salves I would assume
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:39:00.120]  salves whatever you want to call that that liquid shit you rub in that I don't I don't like it that
[02:39:00.120 --> 02:39:04.360]  doesn't do much for me but seven grams of concentrated marijuana like hashish to adults
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:09.720]  over 21 whether you're a Washington resident or not but there isn't expected to be any infused
[02:39:09.720 --> 02:39:14.200]  food or drink available right away as of last week the liquor control board had not issued any
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:19.560]  licenses to processors for those products or approved any edibles for sale some stores are
[02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:25.880]  talking about limiting customers to one two gram package each to make sure there's enough for
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:32.520]  everyone to buy some which appears to be what happened on the first day of sales a lot of the
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:37.480]  shops in Colorado were limiting it to an eighth or a quarter I was actually lucky enough to be
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:43.000]  the first person to buy recreational cannabis at the greener side dispensary in Pueblo Colorado
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:47.160]  and I actually picked up two eighths they were not limiting sales that day but they were not
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:52.120]  doing gram sales is what they were doing it was an eighth minimum and they had everything pre-packaged
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:55.960]  and yeah they weren't doing any grams so they didn't have any of that like let me get a gram
[02:39:55.960 --> 02:40:00.360]  of this a gram of this a gram of this it was let me get an eighth let me get an eighth and I picked
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:05.640]  up the Girl Scout cookies and some Tahoe OG and to tell you the truth those packages are still
[02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:11.240]  sealed on my desk with the receipt sitting next to them I have not smoked it I haven't touched it
[02:40:11.240 --> 02:40:16.840]  uh that's nostalgia I hardly smoke herb that I did not grow myself I'm picky like that but I

[02:42:06.840 --> 02:42:10.040]  to find this other article I'm clicking around trying to find it it's in here it's in the
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:15.720]  computer somebody typed it I promise you it exists uh who remembers the episode where we gave thanks
[02:42:15.720 --> 02:42:21.880]  to Mr. Mark Emery Mark Emery is a guy who was in federal prison in America and he actually did not
[02:42:21.880 --> 02:42:25.960]  commit any crime in my opinion he was a Canadian guy he was shipping seeds across the world
[02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:32.920]  and uh the Canadian authorities and the American authorities united and they extradited him to
[02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:41.640]  America and they put his ass in prison he actually served uh let's see 1,590 days which guess what
[02:42:41.640 --> 02:42:49.640]  that means he was officially his sentence ended July 9th uh he is not home yet there's a bunch of
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:54.760]  crap you got to go through once you get out of prison and you're not a U.S. citizen so I'm going
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:59.800]  to read something this is from Mark Emery's blog this actually comes from cannabisculture.com
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:04.120]  a lot of it is written by his wife Jody I've been paying a lot of attention to what's going on with
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:08.520]  Mark through his Twitter his wife Jody updates the Twitter forum quite often and he was actually
[02:43:08.520 --> 02:43:14.840]  allowed internet access in the prison he was in so I'll quit rambling and here is uh by Mark Emery
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:20.120]  written Monday June 30th with a few updates from Jody Emery spattered in there and I'll let you
[02:43:20.120 --> 02:43:25.320]  know when those happen so this says this is my last blog from the terminals of the U.S. Bureau
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:32.600]  of Prisons my sentence was for five years which would be 1,825 days and I earned all 235 days of
[02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:39.080]  my eligible good contact conduct credit so my sentence officially ends at 1,590 days which is
[02:43:39.080 --> 02:43:45.560]  Wednesday July 9th on Thursday July 10th U.S. Immigration picks me up and takes me to the private
[02:43:46.440 --> 02:43:53.720]  for-profit GEO group or GEO group uh LaSalle detention facility in Gina Louisiana where I
[02:43:53.720 --> 02:43:59.240]  will be processed for deportation back to Canada but then this is where Jody interjects with an
[02:43:59.240 --> 02:44:04.680]  update it says July 11th update by Jody Emery Mark is not at LaSalle detention facility he has been
[02:44:04.680 --> 02:44:11.560]  sent to Tensas I don't know how to read that one Tensas Parish Detention Center in Louisiana
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:17.160]  they give his alien ID number and she says I don't know how long he will be there you can look
[02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:22.440]  up his alien ID number at the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement website detainee locator page
[02:44:22.440 --> 02:44:28.920]  for information about where he currently is she gives an address to send Mark letters or books you
[02:44:28.920 --> 02:44:33.400]  can only order the books online they can't be sent from an individual they have to come from a
[02:44:33.400 --> 02:44:37.720]  distributor or a vendor so that they know you're not sticking shit in there but then there is an
[02:44:37.720 --> 02:44:44.600]  address to ship books to I won't read it right now he will be there until August he predicts
[02:44:44.680 --> 02:44:52.600]  so here is the address Mark Emery it's uh M-A-R-C-E-M-E-R-Y and then you've got to put
[02:44:52.600 --> 02:45:01.960]  this number this is his number uh number zero seven nine zero six seven seven one zero I'll
[02:45:01.960 --> 02:45:10.280]  repeat it for you if you're as high as me it's zero seven nine zero six seven seven one zero
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:19.000]  and then you're sending sending some books or a letter of encouragement to uh it's T-E-N-S-A-S
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:27.400]  Parish Tense's Parish P-A-R-I-S-H P-A-R-I-S-H I say that right sorry I'm reading it I'm high
[02:45:27.400 --> 02:45:33.640]  uh Tense's Parish Detention Center it's spelled C-E-N-T-R-E because it's in Louisiana they spell
[02:45:33.800 --> 02:45:40.600]  silly there uh it's eight six zero six highway 65 waterproof Louisiana which is L-A
[02:45:41.560 --> 02:45:46.360]  and then the zip code is seven one three seven five I will try to remember to tweet that
[02:45:47.400 --> 02:45:48.840]  I'm writing a note to tweet that
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:56.780]  all right sorry that took a second to write the note so you can send letters of encouragement
[02:45:56.780 --> 02:46:00.540]  you can send him all kinds of letters don't send him anything fucking stupid it's a prison come on
[02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:06.780]  be smart please but you can send him letters you can send him uh like anything that he might want
[02:46:06.780 --> 02:46:12.700]  to read help him out pass the time so Mark continues and he says uh my understanding is
[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:16.940]  that I'll be dropped off ultimately at the border in Windsor Ontario I'm thinking sometime between
[02:46:16.940 --> 02:46:22.620]  August 10th and August 25th that's a month after his release date but we have no way of knowing for
[02:46:22.620 --> 02:46:26.860]  sure you'd think that uh you'd think that would be a straightforward process taking a few days at
[02:46:26.860 --> 02:46:31.980]  most but LaSalle is a for-profit GEO group detention center and thus they're making money
[02:46:31.980 --> 02:46:37.660]  for every day I am there and because the Canadian government is involved these bureaucrats have a
[02:46:37.660 --> 02:46:41.740]  tendency to be slower than they ought to be so I may need your help in providing motivation for
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:47.980]  them to repatriate me back to Canada on a more reasonable and timely schedule the former Canadian
[02:46:47.980 --> 02:46:53.340]  Conrad uh Conrad Black got out of Coleman federal prison in Florida last year he was given
[02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:59.180]  he was driven straight forward to Miami and able to go immediately to Toronto on a flight with his
[02:46:59.180 --> 02:47:06.780]  wife uh Barbara Amiel uh that was extraordinarily not the least of which because Conrad Black is not
[02:47:06.780 --> 02:47:11.420]  even a Canadian citizen anymore and it has never happened to any other Canadian in a U.S. prison
[02:47:11.420 --> 02:47:16.620]  no doubt his friendship with former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and others got him an instant
[02:47:16.620 --> 02:47:21.260]  express immigration approval back to Canada but it shows a clear unfairness that a man who
[02:47:21.260 --> 02:47:25.980]  renounced his Canadian citizenship so he could be lord in the British House of Commons
[02:47:25.980 --> 02:47:31.580]  gets treatment far beyond what any actual Canadian citizen like myself currently receives
[02:47:31.580 --> 02:47:35.420]  from the Canadian government I say like myself because that's what Mark wrote I am not Canadian
[02:47:35.420 --> 02:47:41.260]  I'm an American I'm from California but I'm from Colorado now I get no connections in the high
[02:47:41.260 --> 02:47:48.300]  places a long drawn out delayed route to an unceremonious drop-off in Windsor Ontario at that
[02:47:48.300 --> 02:47:53.500]  not even to my home in Vancouver sorry Mark writes strangely in long sentences and I'm high
[02:47:53.500 --> 02:47:58.460]  no cushy flight for me back to the airport of my choice alongside my wife like Conrad my point being
[02:47:58.460 --> 02:48:02.940]  if they could get non-Canadian Conrad's paperwork ready in advance to get to Toronto immediately
[02:48:02.940 --> 02:48:08.220]  upon his U.S. federal prison release they could have mine ready too last I checked I am still a
[02:48:08.220 --> 02:48:14.780]  Canadian citizen so then Jody updated she says July 11th update the following information is not
[02:48:14.780 --> 02:48:19.900]  completely accurate because Mark is not at LaSalle he is at Tance's Parish detention facility stay
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:25.100]  tuned for updates as they come then Mark continues at any rate once I arrived at LaSalle I will be
[02:48:25.100 --> 02:48:29.820]  given an alien number and Jody will update this blog to indicate what my a number is but you see
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:36.300]  my a number in this blog I've been told that you can actually send me messages over the phone or
[02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:39.900]  by calling a phone number which doesn't is no good anymore so I won't even bother reading it
[02:48:40.620 --> 02:48:44.380]  the receptionist will deliver messages okay I gotta skip all this because
[02:48:44.380 --> 02:48:47.580]  he says I buy phone cards and I can call out without limits on phone time
[02:48:48.380 --> 02:48:55.340]  it's not quite a prison okay but he's not there anymore he says I'm done with my official U.S.
[02:48:55.340 --> 02:48:59.820]  sentence but I still can't leave until they take me so it's purgatory of sorts when I get my a
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:04.700]  number I am also assigned my deportation officer I will fill out my temporary passport information
[02:49:04.780 --> 02:49:10.700]  have my photo taken I'll fill out my forms and my deportation officer fills in his part
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:16.380]  and afterwards it's on to the Canadian consul in Dallas Texas a fellow by the name of to a fellow
[02:49:16.380 --> 02:49:20.460]  by the name of David Martinez once I am at LaSalle Jody will post that phone number here
[02:49:21.100 --> 02:49:25.500]  which she can't do because he of course didn't make it there all of the communication between
[02:49:25.500 --> 02:49:31.180]  LaSalle and the Canadian consul in Dallas who liaisons to his boss in Ottawa is done electronically
[02:49:31.180 --> 02:49:34.540]  so that ought to be done quickly that is within days but I'm certain that
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:40.700]  perfidious actors in Ottawa could choose to be deliberately slow lazy or obstructive simply
[02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:44.860]  because it's me and the Harper government is hardly eager to have me back in Canada
[02:49:44.860 --> 02:49:50.540]  that is where many supporters can influence events should this procedure get unduly tardy
[02:49:51.180 --> 02:49:55.660]  I may need all of you to call one of those three locations or all three locations for several
[02:49:55.660 --> 02:50:00.460]  several hours a day urging an end to any questionable delays if they should happen
[02:50:00.460 --> 02:50:05.100]  but we will see just be ready to help if you are so inclined once the government paperwork is
[02:50:05.100 --> 02:50:09.820]  completed and my temporary passport is done the INS people at LaSalle merely need to book my flight
[02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:15.900]  then take me to Alexandria Louisiana and fly me to Detroit Michigan and escort me over the border
[02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:21.180]  point into Windsor Ontario however many US imprisoned Canadians have waited weeks for
[02:50:21.180 --> 02:50:25.900]  their flights to be booked because the prisons make more money the longer we are there but then
[02:50:25.900 --> 02:50:30.700]  again let us be optimistic and hope that big can't hope that a big campaign to urge my speedy
[02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:35.740]  return will prove to be unnecessary this is getting a little long there's only a little
[02:50:35.740 --> 02:50:39.020]  bit more guys thanks for paying attention this is Mark Emery we're talking about so it's worth
[02:50:39.020 --> 02:50:45.100]  listening to at this facility we don't get outside much but I can buy items from the commissary daily
[02:50:45.100 --> 02:50:49.100]  I can't take anything with me he's just talking about the place he thinks he's going to which
[02:50:49.100 --> 02:50:53.420]  I won't even read it because he didn't get to go there if you want to send me anything to help me
[02:50:53.420 --> 02:50:57.740]  get comfortable comfortable upon my arrival and during my hopefully short stay you can use your
[02:50:57.740 --> 02:51:01.260]  credit card to send me twenty dollars or thirty dollars to help pay for my phone calls and I'll
[02:51:01.260 --> 02:51:08.060]  thank you all and buy food and clothes refer to my a number refer my name and a number when it gets
[02:51:08.060 --> 02:51:12.460]  Jody will post it she's done that we've read that part I believe only US credit cards will work but
[02:51:12.460 --> 02:51:17.420]  I hope the Canadian credit cards will be okay too because that's all Jody has so when this guy's in
[02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:22.300]  he's out of prison and he's still locked up and still in prison which sucks the prison he was in
[02:51:22.300 --> 02:51:26.060]  was much better than where they're putting him now for this temporary time so he's got to
[02:51:26.060 --> 02:51:30.300]  fucking deal with that shit after he's supposed to be out so he says when I'm finally placed on
[02:51:30.300 --> 02:51:36.140]  the plane to Alexandria Louisiana and flown to Detroit oh yeah me fuck I'm trying to go fast I
[02:51:36.140 --> 02:51:41.420]  will be met by two US marshals and then driven through a tunnel to Windsor Ontario Canadian
[02:51:41.420 --> 02:51:46.060]  customs and immigration office I hope I will have enough advance notice to call Jody and have her
[02:51:46.060 --> 02:51:50.940]  fly standby to Toronto from Vancouver then get to Windsor to be there waiting for me and if you live
[02:51:50.940 --> 02:51:56.140]  in the Windsor area I hope to see you there also so he's inviting you Canadians out if you're in
[02:51:56.140 --> 02:52:00.700]  Windsor and when Mark gets out and you're in the Windsor area he hopes to see you there so follow

[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:49.520]  uh we are going to do a grow lesson on this episode i want to talk about something real
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.360]  quick before we do that i've been putting out these flyers for the igrowculture podcast my
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:57.520]  friend adam puts them out for me shout out adam thanks a lot bro uh he puts these little flyers
[03:01:57.520 --> 03:02:01.600]  they're just the size of a quarter sheet of paper says listen to the igrowculture podcast for free
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:06.400]  grow lessons and cannabis news something funny that happened we did that episode at the hookah bar
[03:02:06.720 --> 03:02:11.200]  left a few of those there on the table and the police have been going to that hookah bar randomly
[03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:15.920]  trying to bust people smoking weed there and it's not happening but the only thing they found are
[03:02:15.920 --> 03:02:21.360]  these igrowculture podcast flyers with the weed leaf on there and they insist that that is some
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:27.040]  sort of code to like get weed or something somewhere and it's not guys if you uh if you
[03:02:27.040 --> 03:02:33.200]  took the time to scan the qr code that is on that flyer it brought you to this podcast oh god sorry
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:36.720]  coughing because i took a dab in the privacy of my own home like i'm allowed to do as a colorado
[03:02:36.720 --> 03:02:41.360]  resident but if the cops are listening to this show the qr code worked the flyer did exactly
[03:02:41.360 --> 03:02:45.120]  what i was supposed to do was it had to get people to listen to the podcast so i think it's really
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:49.120]  hilarious they thought a little it's just a flyer that says to listen to a show they thought that
[03:02:49.120 --> 03:02:55.040]  was some sort of code to get you some free weed that's really funny uh inaccurate guys great
[03:02:55.040 --> 03:02:59.280]  police work there all right uh i obviously can't breathe from the dab that i just took so give me
[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:02.800]  a second to take a drink and i'll be right back we'll read some news and we will get on with it
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:08.720]  grow less and hang out guys all right guys i think i've recovered from those dabs i got a nice drink
[03:03:08.720 --> 03:03:12.960]  of water it got nice and comfortable i want to read you a news article that comes from colorado
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:18.480]  this is actually written in the cannabis again from our good friend ricardo bacca the headline
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:24.800]  is edibles recall at home bakes use of washing machine for hash questioned and it says the
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:29.440]  popular denver-based brand of marijuana infused edibles was recalled by denver department of
[03:03:29.440 --> 03:03:34.320]  environmental health on july 17th because of the possible contamination from unsanitary equipment
[03:03:34.320 --> 03:03:38.800]  and use of equipment not intended for food manufacturing according to the department's
[03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:43.760]  public health inspections division the manufacturer of the recalled edibles at home baked operates on
[03:03:43.760 --> 03:03:48.800]  the same state marijuana license as dispensary group advanced medical alternatives we're really
[03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:54.800]  frustrated with the entire situation said aj hash car aj ash car sorry he's also known to me as aj
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:59.120]  hashman that's what i would always call him so i said i saw ash car and i just said hash car because
[03:03:59.120 --> 03:04:03.680]  it seemed like it worked but anyway uh the co-owner of at home baked who is known in the denver
[03:04:03.680 --> 03:04:08.400]  marijuana industry as h a hashman they came in and the machine which we're utilizing to make water
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:14.960]  hash was not food not a food safe machine food safe machines to make water hash do not exist
[03:04:14.960 --> 03:04:19.440]  they deemed the water hash that we were making unfit for human consumption even though nobody
[03:04:19.440 --> 03:04:24.240]  has gotten sick from our hash the department of environmental health verified that there haven't
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:29.440]  been any reports of illness yet but a food safety inspection was the reason for the recall ash car
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:33.760]  has been using a modified washing machine to activate his water hash a common practice in this
[03:04:33.760 --> 03:04:39.040]  industry to get the centrifugal action that is essential to the water hash said ash car also
[03:04:39.040 --> 03:04:44.080]  known for his popular marijuana meet and greets in denver colorado uh dude aj throws some great
[03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:47.760]  parties he hasn't been able to do them anymore because the denver police have actually been
[03:04:47.760 --> 03:04:52.080]  shutting those parties down uh because we're smoking cannabis and not drinking alcohol
[03:04:52.400 --> 03:04:58.480]  anyway the article says my business partner and i both have culinary backgrounds food service
[03:04:58.480 --> 03:05:03.200]  backgrounds and we look at water hash as a concentrate not a food ash car said but they
[03:05:03.200 --> 03:05:08.880]  say as soon as you start working with it uh with a food as the intent or the end result it is food
[03:05:09.920 --> 03:05:13.680]  which i kind of agree with that you know it's got to be food we're going to eat that hash that's the
[03:05:13.680 --> 03:05:17.520]  active ingredient that we're searching for so it's got to be clean it's got to be food grade
[03:05:18.240 --> 03:05:21.200]  in june ash car received a variance from the state through september
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:26.880]  to find a food safe alternative and he purchased a bubble magic machine he hopes will satisfy their
[03:05:26.880 --> 03:05:31.600]  regulations in the meantime the state demanded that he recall all products made in his old
[03:05:31.600 --> 03:05:37.040]  washing machine at home baked products were recalled on july 17th the ad sorry let me reread
[03:05:37.040 --> 03:05:42.240]  that sentence for you the at home baked products that were recalled on july 17th include its
[03:05:42.320 --> 03:05:48.240]  infused brownie mixes blondie mixes rice krispy treats and sticks candy sorry i'm fired up on
[03:05:48.240 --> 03:05:52.560]  this episode i'm going really fast because i want to get to that grow lesson uh he continues to say
[03:05:52.560 --> 03:05:57.440]  please pull our products off your shelf and place in the back room and contact me to replace them
[03:05:57.440 --> 03:06:02.560]  at home bake published on its facebook on july 16th so sorry for the inconvenience we look forward
[03:06:02.560 --> 03:06:09.040]  to restocking you asap once we have more info and a time frame at home baked war place all products
[03:06:09.040 --> 03:06:14.000]  in question or refund purchases ashkar said the department of environmental health is saying that
[03:06:14.000 --> 03:06:17.920]  any of the above at home baked products should be removed from the retail shelves and destroyed
[03:06:17.920 --> 03:06:24.320]  immediately pursuant pursuant to state medical and retail marijuana regulations but what does
[03:06:24.320 --> 03:06:29.360]  this mean for at home bakes business it's an extremely difficult blow ashkar said it'll be
[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:36.160]  difficult to keep our head above water ah man that's rough times for aj hashman and the at home
[03:06:36.160 --> 03:06:41.040]  baked company i want to give a big shout out to aj he's uh he's been a huge supporter of this
[03:06:41.040 --> 03:06:45.360]  community he actually threw those meet and greets like they were talking about if you go to an event
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:49.440]  in colorado aj has got a booth there they're giving out sticks they're giving out free samples
[03:06:50.080 --> 03:06:54.960]  he's done a lot for us so when he does get his products back on the shelf somebody one of the
[03:06:54.960 --> 03:07:00.960]  dispensaries needs to send them over to steep hill halen labs get them tested get the uh profile
[03:07:00.960 --> 03:07:05.200]  printed out post that online show what he's got going on and then we should all go buy those if
[03:07:05.200 --> 03:07:08.880]  it's a good product again and we should support aj to help him get back on his feet because this is
[03:07:08.880 --> 03:07:14.640]  a big blow for a small company like what aj's got going on i want to make the news real quick

[03:07:58.240 --> 03:08:02.800]  location in pueblo tell them rasta jeff sent you they like to know that i'm sending people and that
[03:08:02.800 --> 03:08:06.160]  means they know you're listening to the podcast it knows their advertising dollars are going
[03:08:06.720 --> 03:08:11.440]  the right direction all right let's get down to a grow lesson a few weeks ago we cut some clones we
[03:08:11.440 --> 03:08:16.720]  germinated seeds and then we put those seedlings and clones into cups to let them develop roots so
[03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:21.440]  it's probably on the time schedule i've been on it's probably past time to get those into pots and
[03:08:21.440 --> 03:08:25.680]  start the vegetative phase so i apologize if i'm a little behind schedule i've had a lot of
[03:08:25.680 --> 03:08:31.520]  podcasting to try to cram in anyway let's talk about the size pots we're going to use i like
[03:08:31.520 --> 03:08:36.320]  to go straight into the pots that i'm going to finish in like the uh what i transplant into now
[03:08:36.320 --> 03:08:42.720]  from the cups is going to be our finished pot so we were in cups uh we're going to go into pots
[03:08:42.720 --> 03:08:46.800]  choosing your pot size is important is an important thing to consider i like to run my test plants in
[03:08:46.800 --> 03:08:51.760]  three gallon pots and my big plants in seven gallon pots uh some of you guys like to go even
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:55.440]  bigger but for an indoor crop i think a seven gallon pot is plenty large enough if you're going
[03:08:55.440 --> 03:09:02.960]  outside uh you can go 50 to 100 or i've seen 250 gallon pots outside earth pots but if you're going
[03:09:02.960 --> 03:09:07.600]  that big you should just go into the ground i think anyway i think i'm rambling uh three to
[03:09:07.600 --> 03:09:11.520]  five gallon pots are great for vegging plants for a few weeks and then flowering i don't like to let
[03:09:11.520 --> 03:09:16.800]  them veg in three gallon pots for longer than like 45 days or so once the plants start to get too big
[03:09:16.800 --> 03:09:21.280]  for that they'll get a little bit root bound so if you want to vege your plants for more time to get
[03:09:21.280 --> 03:09:28.080]  bigger uh plants and bigger buds use larger pots if i want to run a fast crop i run about 16
[03:09:28.080 --> 03:09:32.480]  three gallon pots under a thousand watt light these are usually from seed if i'm running like
[03:09:32.480 --> 03:09:37.520]  a little tester crop is what i do that for if i'm running a production crop i'll put between four
[03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:42.640]  and six seven gallon pots under a thousand watt light depending on the strain if they get taller
[03:09:42.640 --> 03:09:47.760]  and thinner i'll put uh six of them if they're like bushier plants like i'll say the grateful
[03:09:47.760 --> 03:09:53.920]  dog i'll only put four lemon jeffery i'll put six uh just kind of because the lemon jeffery gets
[03:09:53.920 --> 03:09:58.320]  taller than it does wide so i'll put six of them under there and uh pull a pretty nice harvest about
[03:09:58.320 --> 03:10:03.040]  a pound and a half from six lemon jeffery plants and seven gallon pots under a thousand watt light
[03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:10.480]  of course i can get i can get that pound and a half from four of them but i have to let it veg
[03:10:10.480 --> 03:10:14.960]  just a little bit longer maybe like two weeks more and then the but that's just that's the
[03:10:14.960 --> 03:10:19.840]  difference in the pot size and the veg times and how many pots that's where you start doing that
[03:10:19.840 --> 03:10:24.720]  kind of math but uh both of these methods will harvest me about a pound pound and a half if done
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:30.080]  correctly the smaller plants take less time to veg but i like the production from a seven gallon pot
[03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:33.840]  they're a little bit bigger they seem like they're able to grow more when they have a bigger root ball
[03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:39.280]  they just seem to take off the uh they grow larger in flower they seem like they keep growing a little
[03:10:39.280 --> 03:10:44.400]  bit taller they don't cut off as early in their growth phase in flower so uh we're also limited
[03:10:44.400 --> 03:10:48.480]  by plant count so a few larger pots is better for the medical growers if you have a small
[03:10:48.480 --> 03:10:53.360]  grow space of course use smaller pots if you have room for larger pots go for larger pots you can
[03:10:53.360 --> 03:10:57.680]  experiment and see what and why and how it all works best for your needs and your environment
[03:10:57.680 --> 03:11:02.720]  how much herb you need uh how often you need it what strains you're going to grow those are all
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:09.200]  things that are going to kind of decide this stuff for you excuse my dab cough i like to take a lot
[03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:12.560]  of dabs when i record a podcast adam was here watching me record and he's like dude how do you
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.560]  even record with that many dabs going on i recorded some stuff with him i'll make another episode out
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:20.400]  of that we got a little out of hand and just started rambling so anyway i'm doing that again
[03:11:20.400 --> 03:11:25.840]  here we go uh once you've chosen your pot size it's time for a good soil like a nice fluffy soil
[03:11:25.840 --> 03:11:29.840]  uh with lots of perlite in it i had plenty of amendments so i buy a fairly inert soil
[03:11:30.640 --> 03:11:34.400]  uh if you have access to a good grow supply store then i recommend starting with something like
[03:11:34.400 --> 03:11:38.400]  roots organic sunshine mix number four something similar to that these are all great starters
[03:11:39.040 --> 03:11:43.280]  i use a recycled and amended soil mix that can get a little complex and it can make it hard to
[03:11:43.280 --> 03:11:48.160]  diagnose problems if one comes up so i recommend learning with the basic soil and organic bottled
[03:11:48.160 --> 03:11:52.800]  nutrients unless you have experience with farming horticulture composting or some kind of soil or
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:11:57.760]  plant education once you understand the basics of the plants we can make a super soil mix and
[03:11:57.760 --> 03:12:01.680]  work on eliminating the bottle feeds but for now let's keep it simple and develop a good
[03:12:01.680 --> 03:12:05.920]  understanding of these plants that's where we want to start so you've got some soil you got
[03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:09.040]  some pots no we've got some small plants that are in cups let's get those babies
[03:12:09.760 --> 03:12:15.760]  into the big girl pots and then we'll talk about feeding for the vegetation phase so having the
[03:12:15.760 --> 03:12:20.240]  little babies in cuffs is really going to help out and make it easy to transplant i fill my pots with
[03:12:20.240 --> 03:12:24.000]  soil and i pack it in there slightly tight i just press it down with my hands and i don't pack it so
[03:12:24.000 --> 03:12:28.320]  tightly that the roots can't dig through but i do want to pack it tightly enough to where the plant's
[03:12:28.320 --> 03:12:32.880]  going to have plenty of support once i bury that root ball in there if the soil is packed too lightly
[03:12:32.880 --> 03:12:36.560]  you'll know because as soon as you water the water is going to run right through the dirt and
[03:12:36.560 --> 03:12:40.720]  the soil is going to cave in and then you'll have to refill in there but anyway fill your pots about
[03:12:40.720 --> 03:12:45.600]  two inches from the top or more for bigger pots we want to save some space for watering a seven
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:49.600]  gallon pot will take a gallon of water or more and that needs some space in your pot and a three
[03:12:49.600 --> 03:12:53.680]  gallon pot you'll easily take half a gallon up to a gallon so save yourself some space
[03:12:54.240 --> 03:12:58.960]  so i get the pot mostly full and i dig out about a large handful of soil out of the center of the
[03:12:58.960 --> 03:13:04.960]  pot i set the clone in the cup it's still in the plastic cup right now for a minute i set that cup
[03:13:04.960 --> 03:13:09.680]  in the spot where the clone is going to go and i backfill the dirt around the cup this makes a
[03:13:09.680 --> 03:13:14.880]  perfect little spot for the clone to fit without disturbing the roots but i don't leave the cup
[03:13:14.880 --> 03:13:19.120]  okay i want to stress that i do not leave the cup on the clone only for that one second while i was
[03:13:19.120 --> 03:13:24.640]  making an indention i don't leave the cup i only uh i only use it to make a little space for the
[03:13:24.640 --> 03:13:30.080]  clone once i've got the perfect little space in there made for my clone i pull that cup out with
[03:13:30.080 --> 03:13:35.280]  the clone in it and then i hold the cup upside down uh with my hand on top of the cup with the
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:39.920]  clone coming out like between my middle and ring finger and i flip the cup upside down
[03:13:41.440 --> 03:13:45.600]  excuse me sorry i flip it upside down i give it a little squeeze and then usually you could just
[03:13:45.600 --> 03:13:51.280]  squeeze it and shake it until the clone slides out of the cup and then try not to uh try not
[03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:55.920]  to disturb the roots and that soil ball that come right out of there just shake it it'll come out
[03:13:55.920 --> 03:14:00.560]  and set that little soil ball perfectly uh into that perfect little spot that we just made it
[03:14:00.560 --> 03:14:06.320]  should be the same shape as the cup since you just make it so just set it right down in there when the
[03:14:06.320 --> 03:14:11.360]  come cup comes off there'll be dirt falling out uh it'll seem chaotic and messy but just stay calm
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:15.520]  you could drop dirt and shit just don't drop the plant just focus on getting that tiny little root
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:20.400]  ball into that hole that we just made and everything should be just fine so now you've
[03:14:20.400 --> 03:14:24.240]  taken your cup you flipped it upside down that little baby plant's falling out you got a handful
[03:14:24.240 --> 03:14:28.880]  of dirt you're holding your new fucking life right there in your hand you set it in that like remember
[03:14:28.880 --> 03:14:32.080]  that little toy you used to have when you're a kid you had to put the little peg into the whole thing
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:37.040]  so what you want to do just set it right in there and now uh you got to get some dirt and put it
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:41.440]  over the top of that i just get it like a small handful of soil and i drop it over the top of the
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:45.120]  whole plant like right where not the whole plant but all the soil right where i just put the new
[03:14:45.120 --> 03:14:50.000]  freshly planted plant and uh all around the rest to kind of level it out so that you just kind of
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:54.560]  camouflage the where the spot was you kind of just want to blend it in you want all that to become
[03:14:54.560 --> 03:15:01.280]  one spot now i press it down just tightly enough to hold the plant upright and carefully label your
[03:15:01.280 --> 03:15:07.680]  newly potted plant label it it sucks having a plant that's not labeled uh if the cup was well labeled
[03:15:07.680 --> 03:15:12.320]  uh also leave that cup in there so that way if your label comes off the cup is still in there
[03:15:12.320 --> 03:15:16.240]  sometimes that helps i sometimes i just use the cup but once in a while i knock the cup out and
[03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:20.800]  they get confused so that sucks so once i've got that potted i set it under the light and i keep
[03:15:20.800 --> 03:15:25.440]  working until all of my new babies are in pots once everything is potted is when i'll feed them
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:30.960]  and make sure to get the pots thoroughly wet so you've got to crop a freshly transplanted planted
[03:15:30.960 --> 03:15:36.320]  babies under the lights and now that's pretty much the beginning of the vegetative growth phase it's
[03:15:36.320 --> 03:15:43.680]  time to mix up some nutrients and feed them their uh first full veg nutrients i'm a soil grower so
[03:15:43.680 --> 03:15:47.360]  i pretty much focus on a dirt garden if you're running a hydro garden we're gonna have to get a
[03:15:47.360 --> 03:15:52.400]  hydro go hydro guy on the show here in the future and have him teach you guys some stuff
[03:15:53.600 --> 03:15:58.800]  let's feed our new babies if you're a new grower i recommend mixing your nutrients in a five gallon
[03:15:58.800 --> 03:16:04.800]  bucket use an accurate measuring device for your nutrients i use the shot glass that has milliliters
[03:16:04.800 --> 03:16:09.680]  and stuff marked on it for small applications for larger stuff there's a pint glass that is
[03:16:09.680 --> 03:16:12.720]  marked with milliliters and a few other measurements you can find those at your
[03:16:12.720 --> 03:16:17.680]  local hydro shop i found a half gallon pitcher that fits perfectly into my five gallon bucket
[03:16:17.680 --> 03:16:24.000]  i've learned my learned to mix my nutrients into that pitcher and add that to the bucket instead
[03:16:24.000 --> 03:16:29.680]  of mixing my nutrients directly into a five gallon bucket you don't want to pour out five gallons of
[03:16:29.680 --> 03:16:33.600]  water when you mess up mixing your nutrient feed that's a lot of water to pour down the drain
[03:16:34.240 --> 03:16:38.800]  so fill your pitcher three quarters of the way with water add your nutrients of choice to the pitcher
[03:16:40.160 --> 03:16:44.000]  i would use a good base nutrient a good root inoculant and some good enzymes
[03:16:44.000 --> 03:16:50.480]  specifically i would use 50 milliliters of botanic care pure blend pro veg soil formula as my base
[03:16:50.480 --> 03:16:55.680]  i would use ogt or great white shark as my mycos which is your inoculant and i would use
[03:16:55.680 --> 03:17:01.760]  15 milliliters of hydrazine as my enzymes so in my garden i would add a little bit of liquid
[03:17:01.760 --> 03:17:06.800]  karma and a few other supplements but they're not required i had sweet to feed my beneficials
[03:17:07.280 --> 03:17:14.800]  i had vitamino for extra vitamins and amino acids and vitamin b also and what else do i add in there
[03:17:14.800 --> 03:17:18.400]  seems like i added something else but uh if you're not looking to spend if you're not looking to spend
[03:17:18.400 --> 03:17:24.000]  the extra bucks those aren't required but i like to spoil my plants uh after about a week i'll
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:29.120]  during the next week i'll feed calmag and potassium silicates and then i run most of the botanic here
[03:17:29.120 --> 03:17:34.320]  botanic care pure blend pro line when i run bottled nutrients botanic care is not a sponsor
[03:17:34.880 --> 03:17:40.160]  but i've been most satisfied with botanic care and organic care more than any other bottle feed
[03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:45.520]  that's that's just my opinion i ran advanced nutrients i've ran the aurora soul synthetics
[03:17:45.520 --> 03:17:52.640]  which produced some super tasty products i ran psycho which was probably uh not my favorite
[03:17:53.360 --> 03:17:59.040]  um yeah i've ran a bunch of them i've ran the fox farms basic stuff i've done a lot of feeds i've
[03:17:59.040 --> 03:18:04.000]  done so many i can't even remember them all anyway uh you can find a pretty good pre-made botanic care
[03:18:04.240 --> 03:18:08.960]  chart on their website i'll try to remember to post some of my notes on the feeding programs
[03:18:08.960 --> 03:18:13.600]  feeding programs for that somebody tweet me and remind me i grow culture i've got this paper here
[03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:18.320]  in front of me so hopefully that'll remind me uh let's get back on focus a little bit and talk
[03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:26.000]  about mixing stuff up mix up your bottled feeds in a small container of water but don't ever mix
[03:18:26.000 --> 03:18:31.200]  your nutrients together without plenty of water don't pour like a shot glass the measuring device
[03:18:31.840 --> 03:18:37.280]  don't pour the veg stuff and then don't pour enzymes into the same shot glass at the same time
[03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:42.400]  mix those to water the bottled stuff is sold in separate bottles to prevent bonding of specific
[03:18:42.400 --> 03:18:47.600]  elements so always mix into water once your pitcher is mixed put that into the five gallon
[03:18:47.600 --> 03:18:52.240]  bucket and fill it up the rest of the way once the buckets full you need to adjust the ph of
[03:18:52.240 --> 03:18:58.800]  your feed solution adjust your ph to 6.5 using ph down it's unlikely that your ph is too low
[03:18:59.520 --> 03:19:03.600]  and make sure you calibrate your ph meters frequently that's always a good idea so you
[03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:08.640]  got a bucket full of nutrient solution that has been ph adjusted to 6.5 we've got our freshly
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:13.520]  transplanted babies under a light the next thing we got to do is pour the feed into the plants so
[03:19:14.480 --> 03:19:19.680]  oh i hope you've got a uh some type of saucer or something under to catch the runoff on your
[03:19:19.680 --> 03:19:24.400]  plants also like sit your plants in a saucer or a tray if you don't have something like that
[03:19:25.120 --> 03:19:29.840]  sometimes i use a i've got a rubbermaid tray that'll fit three three gallon pots in there
[03:19:29.840 --> 03:19:34.160]  perfectly so i can just pour water into the plants and then it'll drain right into there
[03:19:34.160 --> 03:19:37.680]  if not you're gonna end up with water on the floor so you need something to catch the runoff
[03:19:37.680 --> 03:19:41.840]  that comes out of your plants so i kind of use the pitcher that i'm using to stir up the solution
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:45.680]  before i go right to the plants to try to mix up the water a little bit stir up the stuff
[03:19:45.680 --> 03:19:50.480]  it's always a good idea stir everything thoroughly sometimes if i'm using a big batch sometimes i
[03:19:50.480 --> 03:19:55.360]  mix my nutrients into a much larger batch i throw an air stone in there to pump it up a little bit
[03:19:55.360 --> 03:19:59.120]  to aerate it and then while it's doing that i also use a big stick like the kind that you'd use to
[03:19:59.120 --> 03:20:04.080]  support your plants i use that to stir the water up uh it just seems to be effective i like stirring
[03:20:04.080 --> 03:20:08.720]  it it's a good idea so uh mix it up a little bit then simply pour about a third of a gallon of
[03:20:08.720 --> 03:20:14.000]  water of the feed into each plant if you're using larger pots you're going to need more you know
[03:20:14.000 --> 03:20:18.640]  uh if the soil settles uh then you need to add more water you'll notice pretty quickly if it
[03:20:18.640 --> 03:20:23.200]  like crumbles down in once we add the water all the airspace is going to get pushed out it's going
[03:20:23.200 --> 03:20:26.320]  to yeah the dirt's going to move around you may have to adjust some of your plants and some of the
[03:20:26.320 --> 03:20:31.680]  soil so uh water everything and refill any pots that you need to fill with soil and get the plants
[03:20:31.680 --> 03:20:36.320]  under good lights d5 lights are good for veg if you have enough of them close to the plants metal
[03:20:36.320 --> 03:20:41.600]  halides are also ideal for veg growth we want to focus on getting those pots full of roots right
[03:20:41.600 --> 03:20:46.800]  now so the blue spectrum is kind of what we want leds seem to be really good for veg plants but i
[03:20:46.800 --> 03:20:51.360]  personally don't have any experience with the leds but i have seen some great photographs coming
[03:20:51.360 --> 03:20:55.280]  from an led garden shout out to nancy budwell she's growing some bounty killer right now and it
[03:20:55.280 --> 03:21:03.200]  looks amazing so uh try to keep your veg area around 72 to 77 degrees if you're using co2 you
[03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:08.720]  can get it let it get a little bit warmer uh maybe low 80s during the light period during your dark
[03:21:08.720 --> 03:21:14.080]  cycle try to keep them about the same temp or nor more no more than 10 degrees cooler than your
[03:21:14.080 --> 03:21:20.960]  daytime temperatures try to keep your humidity around 40 to 55 percent if possible in colorado
[03:21:20.960 --> 03:21:25.840]  it gets hard to keep the rooms humid so they get dry here honestly you'd rather have it too dry
[03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:30.480]  than too humid if you have the option if you can't get it right where you want it if your blowers are
[03:21:30.480 --> 03:21:34.320]  messed up and not the way you need them to be if you can't correct it i understand you're growing
[03:21:34.320 --> 03:21:38.400]  in a house it's not going to be perfect you'd rather have it too dry than too moist you've got
[03:21:38.400 --> 03:21:44.080]  the option so also remember to keep your air fresh you don't want stale stuffy air in your
[03:21:44.080 --> 03:21:48.960]  grow rooms your plants need plenty of co2 and they deplete the co2 in a room very quickly
[03:21:49.680 --> 03:21:54.240]  having stale air in a grow room can lead to powdery mildew and it slows down the growth of
[03:21:54.240 --> 03:21:59.520]  your plants quite quickly so i keep my vegging plants under 24 hours of light i think they grow
[03:21:59.520 --> 03:22:05.520]  more quickly under 24 hours of light uh than they do with a dark cycle during veg most books will
[03:22:05.520 --> 03:22:10.560]  tell you to run a 16 hour day period and an 8 hour dark period i think it's great because it's
[03:22:10.560 --> 03:22:15.680]  how nature works and you can't argue with that i've experimented with both sometimes if i'm
[03:22:15.680 --> 03:22:22.240]  running a seed crop i will run a 16 hour light cycle and then go to a 12 12 cycle sometimes i
[03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:27.920]  will run an 11 13 cycle which is odd but we'll talk about that later on i learned that from dj short
[03:22:29.120 --> 03:22:34.000]  uh so the that 16 8 light cycle is great like i said it's how nature works it also lets your
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:37.520]  equipment cool down to take a little bit of a break and it lets your electricity bill chill
[03:22:37.520 --> 03:22:41.920]  out for a second lets your meter quit spinning so as long as your vegging plants are under 16
[03:22:41.920 --> 03:22:47.200]  hours of light every day they should be happy you can experiment with it uh i'll do another show
[03:22:47.200 --> 03:22:52.400]  with more info on light cycles and for a photo period later on uh one thing i've really noticed
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:59.280]  is that when i flip my plants to 12 12 to flower from this 24 hour light cycle they show flower
[03:22:59.280 --> 03:23:04.960]  faster than the plants that had a dark cycle during veg and that's just one thing i've noticed
[03:23:04.960 --> 03:23:08.960]  so if you're really looking for a production crop that's something to keep in mind since i just
[03:23:08.960 --> 03:23:13.360]  remembered that that's kind of what inspired that for me i think i might switch back and i also uh
[03:23:13.360 --> 03:23:17.840]  like to keep my mother plants under 12 12 just to keep them from even thinking that they may have
[03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:21.920]  the chance to flower once they get root bound and stuff they sometimes some of your mother plants
[03:23:21.920 --> 03:23:28.160]  may try to auto flower on you so we've got our babies in new pots um and we fed them they're
[03:23:28.160 --> 03:23:32.400]  under good lights i put a fan lightly blowing over the canopy to keep the air circulating
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:36.960]  uh and if the temps and the humidity or humidity are correct in the room the plants won't need
[03:23:36.960 --> 03:23:41.920]  water for uh three or four days if you watered them enough right now so this is a good time to
[03:23:41.920 --> 03:23:46.640]  start thinking about pest management if you have neem oil on hand give each plant a good spray
[03:23:46.640 --> 03:23:51.040]  when the lights turn off you don't want to spray them when the lights are on uh that creates what
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:56.320]  i call little reflector bubbles from the uh you know the bubbles plant on your plant the light
[03:23:56.320 --> 03:24:00.720]  hits it just like a magnifying glass did when you were a little kid and used to cook ants it'll
[03:24:00.720 --> 03:24:06.000]  happen to your plants the grow light will work as the sun and the bubble will work like a magnifying
[03:24:06.000 --> 03:24:10.080]  glass and you'll get a little burn mark a little white spot so spray when the lights are off always
[03:24:10.080 --> 03:24:17.200]  try to spray when the lights are off uh yeah that's any book will tell you that neem will keep
[03:24:17.200 --> 03:24:21.040]  most of your pests away once you're in flower you'll need to rethink the name because you do
[03:24:21.040 --> 03:24:26.240]  not want to spray neem on your flowering plants don't do that it'll taste terrible if you make
[03:24:26.240 --> 03:24:31.520]  concentrates with neem sprayed plants oh excuse me if you make concentrates with neem sprayed
[03:24:31.520 --> 03:24:36.000]  plants you can definitely taste the neem so once you're in flower stop spraying me
[03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:41.520]  i've got a new product i'm testing out if it works for me i'm definitely going to share it with you
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:46.640]  it's uh it's all organic it was recommended to me by somebody in the horticulture industry not
[03:24:46.640 --> 03:24:52.160]  the cannabis industry so it's used for food crops so it's completely safe it didn't smell bad when
[03:24:52.160 --> 03:24:56.320]  i used it i'm kind of testing it out now i'll let you know what i think so you're now officially in
[03:24:56.320 --> 03:25:01.200]  the veg phase i feed bottle nutrients if i'm using bottled nutrients i only feed them once per week
[03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:06.160]  with plain ph water throughout the rest of the week so i personally feed all my plants on monday
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:10.640]  so if you guys are listening to this on monday i'm probably waiting for the lights to come on
[03:25:10.640 --> 03:25:17.760]  the flower room comes on at 10. it'll click on i will actually have my nutrients mixed up already
[03:25:17.760 --> 03:25:23.040]  i'll start doing that about 9 30. it's monday they're gonna get fed i think these plants are in
[03:25:23.040 --> 03:25:26.240]  they're gonna start week five today so i'll start mixing up their week five stuff
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:31.360]  uh get the ph adjusted in there and then i'll throw some air stones in there and let that stuff
[03:25:31.360 --> 03:25:34.640]  just bubble around and let the nutrients mingle for a little while and then as soon as lights come
[03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:41.200]  on i'll go in there and feed them so i'll need to water again usually by thursday uh and once
[03:25:41.200 --> 03:25:45.840]  they get heavier into flower it may step up to wednesday they won't go as long so think about
[03:25:45.840 --> 03:25:49.200]  how tall you can let your plants get that's something you got to keep in mind think about
[03:25:49.200 --> 03:25:54.640]  how tall your plants can get uh think about if you want to top them or let them grow naturally
[03:25:54.640 --> 03:25:59.120]  because your plants some sativa plants can double it in size during flower like if you're growing
[03:25:59.120 --> 03:26:04.000]  the bounty killer that thing is going to double in size during your flower period so it's time
[03:26:04.000 --> 03:26:08.800]  to think about how tall and wide your plants can get before you need to flower them out because
[03:26:08.800 --> 03:26:13.200]  that is going to be the next major phase of your plants you gotta let them veg you probably got
[03:26:13.200 --> 03:26:19.680]  another month to 45 maybe two months if you want to go crazy but i recommend about 30 days veg time
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:24.640]  from here out so don't get any bugs don't burn them with nutrients take good care of them that's
[03:26:24.640 --> 03:26:29.760]  super important uh i think that gets us basically started through the veg phase i plan to go in
[03:26:29.760 --> 03:26:33.600]  depth with each of these little topics in the future we'll make little branches from everything
[03:26:33.600 --> 03:26:38.000]  that i've mentioned i want to get everybody up to speed with the basics before we go too deeply into
[03:26:38.000 --> 03:26:42.320]  specific stuff about growing i've got tons of information to share with you guys if you want
[03:26:42.320 --> 03:26:47.680]  more details on anything i mentioned please just ask me because i would love to help you out i'd
