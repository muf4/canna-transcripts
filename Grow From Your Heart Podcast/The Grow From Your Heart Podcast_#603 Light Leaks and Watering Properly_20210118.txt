[02:00.800 --> 02:02.560]  I hope it is a great day wherever you are.
[02:02.560 --> 02:05.600]  I'm coming to you from a cold Colorado evening.
[02:05.600 --> 02:06.600]  It is super cold here.
[02:06.600 --> 02:09.340]  I'm not going to complain about the weather for too long.
[02:09.340 --> 02:13.680]  Let's jump right into the main topic of today's podcast.
[02:13.680 --> 02:19.200]  It has been brought to my attention that I talk about light leaks on this podcast quite
[02:19.200 --> 02:20.200]  frequently.
[02:20.200 --> 02:25.160]  I've also been told that I have never told you what a light leak officially is.
[02:25.160 --> 02:29.680]  So we're going to start off by talking about light leaks in today's episode.
[02:29.680 --> 02:30.680]  Let's talk about it.
[02:30.680 --> 02:31.680]  Let's jump right into it.
[02:31.680 --> 02:32.760]  What is a light leak?
[02:32.760 --> 02:38.120]  When we are growing cannabis plants, those plants do need a dark cycle to flower.
[02:38.120 --> 02:43.120]  If we want to initiate the flowering period of cannabis plants, of photo period cannabis
[02:43.120 --> 02:45.840]  plants, if you've got auto flowers, this is a different story.
[02:45.840 --> 02:50.160]  However, I'm going to talk about photo period cannabis plants for this example.
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.520]  When we are growing photo period cannabis plants, those plants require an amount of
[02:54.520 --> 02:57.480]  time of uninterrupted total darkness.
[02:57.480 --> 02:59.700]  And I mean, complete total darkness.
[02:59.700 --> 03:03.640]  If you can see your hand in front of your face, it is too bright in that room.
[03:03.640 --> 03:07.200]  I need you to stand in that room for a few minutes and let your eyes adjust.
[03:07.200 --> 03:10.000]  And once your eyes adjust, put your hand in front of your face.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.880]  And if you can see your hand, there is too much light in there.
[03:12.920 --> 03:16.120]  We need complete total darkness.
[03:16.120 --> 03:21.040]  So during the 12 hour dark cycle, which we give our plants to initiate them to flower,
[03:21.040 --> 03:24.840]  most people do a 12 hours on 12 hours off cycle.
[03:24.840 --> 03:25.880]  That's a 24 hour day.
[03:25.880 --> 03:27.040]  They're awake for 12 hours.
[03:27.040 --> 03:28.700]  They sleep for 12 hours.
[03:28.700 --> 03:33.280]  That 12 hour uninterrupted dark period will trigger our plants to go into flower.
[03:33.280 --> 03:37.800]  Now it is very important that we do not interrupt that dark cycle.
[03:37.800 --> 03:39.360]  That is what I call a light leak.
[03:39.360 --> 03:43.680]  When we get light into the night cycle of the plants, we don't want to wake the plants
[03:43.680 --> 03:44.680]  up.
[03:44.680 --> 03:46.400]  We don't want to disrupt their sleep cycle.
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.100]  If we disrupt that sleep cycle, we can cause problems with the plants.
[03:50.100 --> 03:55.400]  We can cause minor problems or we can cause major problems depending on when these light
[03:55.400 --> 03:58.780]  leaks happen, depending on how long, how often they happen.
[03:58.780 --> 03:59.780]  That will depend.
[03:59.780 --> 04:01.500]  Also, it will depend on the genetics.
[04:01.500 --> 04:05.680]  Do those genetics have a tendency to have problems due to light leaks or not?
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.720]  But the things we can see if we do cause light leaks in our grow can be things like
[04:10.720 --> 04:11.860]  intersex traits.
[04:11.860 --> 04:15.180]  We can trigger the plants to throw intersex traits.
[04:15.180 --> 04:19.600]  Normally in nature, once the sun goes down, it's fucking dark until the sun comes up.
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.340]  What would happen if one day the sun came up in the middle of the night?
[04:23.340 --> 04:26.180]  Your whole rhythm, your whole life would freak out.
[04:26.180 --> 04:28.540]  You would go into panic mode.
[04:28.540 --> 04:32.600]  Imagine if some lights come on in the middle of the night in the grow room, they are going
[04:32.600 --> 04:34.040]  to go into panic mode.
[04:34.040 --> 04:35.820]  They're going to say, why is the sun coming up?
[04:35.820 --> 04:37.260]  I don't know what to do.
[04:37.260 --> 04:42.440]  That weird stress, that weird panic mode often causes plants to throw intersex traits.
[04:42.440 --> 04:43.740]  The plants want to survive.
[04:43.740 --> 04:46.920]  Their goal is to reproduce so they can be grown next year.
[04:46.920 --> 04:48.240]  Cannabis plants are annuals.
[04:48.240 --> 04:49.500]  They last one season.
[04:49.500 --> 04:50.500]  They produce seeds.
[04:50.500 --> 04:52.640]  If they're pollinated, then they are gone.
[04:52.640 --> 04:54.500]  We aren't going to pollinate these plants.
[04:54.500 --> 04:55.760]  That's not our intention.
[04:55.760 --> 05:00.120]  But if we do give them some stress, they may decide, hey, the end is near or something's
[05:00.120 --> 05:01.120]  wrong.
[05:01.120 --> 05:05.800]  That's what I can do to make sure I have self-preservation so I can continue my genetics.
[05:05.800 --> 05:08.200]  So then it will show intersex traits.
[05:08.200 --> 05:09.240]  It will make male parts.
[05:09.240 --> 05:10.400]  It will make female parts.
[05:10.400 --> 05:12.000]  It will pollinate itself.
[05:12.000 --> 05:14.860]  And we will have seeded hermaphroditic plants.
[05:14.860 --> 05:16.200]  That's not something we want.
[05:16.200 --> 05:18.720]  So let's not get light leaks into the grow room.
[05:18.720 --> 05:21.260]  Once those lights go off, leave the lights off.
[05:21.260 --> 05:22.720]  Don't go in that grow room.
[05:22.720 --> 05:24.400]  Don't go in there and take pictures.
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.840]  Don't turn on a light to show one of your friends.
[05:26.840 --> 05:28.280]  Leave them in the dark.
[05:28.280 --> 05:29.440]  Let them sleep.
[05:29.440 --> 05:31.560]  We can cause intersex traits.
[05:31.560 --> 05:34.900]  We can also cause them to not flower at all.
[05:34.900 --> 05:38.600]  If you've got a light shining into your grow room when you think it is the dark cycle,
[05:38.600 --> 05:40.840]  those plants just won't go into flower.
[05:40.840 --> 05:43.000]  You will have turned your timer to 12-12.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.360]  You'll be waiting and waiting and waiting.
[05:45.360 --> 05:50.080]  It's usually about 10 to 14, maybe 12-ish days in when we start seeing the plants actually
[05:50.080 --> 05:52.160]  showing us that they are in flower.
[05:52.160 --> 05:53.360]  You may not see that.
[05:53.360 --> 05:58.560]  So if you've been in flower for 14, 15, 16 days and you're not seeing any signs of flower,
[05:58.680 --> 06:00.080]  there is a light leak in that room.
[06:00.080 --> 06:02.520]  You're getting light when it should be dark.
[06:02.520 --> 06:07.320]  Also, something else that can happen, depending on when the light leak, the light interruptions
[06:07.320 --> 06:10.600]  do happen, you can re-veg your plants.
[06:10.600 --> 06:14.840]  Your plants can be in flower for a number of weeks and then something goes wrong to
[06:14.840 --> 06:17.680]  where you are getting a light leak that you don't even know about.
[06:17.680 --> 06:19.320]  Now you're getting extra light.
[06:19.320 --> 06:23.920]  Those plants may go back into the vegetative stage and they won't even finish flowering.
[06:23.920 --> 06:27.920]  You'll have these weird, funky looking buds and you'll have plants with twisted world
[06:27.920 --> 06:30.960]  leaves and you'll be like, what the heck is going on in there?
[06:30.960 --> 06:34.360]  That's when we're going to do a test and you should do this test long before you get to
[06:34.360 --> 06:35.360]  this point.
[06:35.360 --> 06:37.240]  But here's how to test if you have a light leak.
[06:37.240 --> 06:40.440]  Go in the grow room, turn off all of the lights.
[06:40.440 --> 06:44.520]  You got to hang out in that room for five, 10, maybe 15 minutes and allow your eyeballs
[06:44.520 --> 06:48.200]  to adjust to that total pitch black, dark room.
[06:48.200 --> 06:51.440]  Now at this point, hold your hand in front of your face.
[06:51.440 --> 06:55.360]  If you can see your hand or any movement, I'm white and pasty.
[06:55.360 --> 06:57.360]  Any light is going to reflect off of my hand.
[06:57.360 --> 07:01.840]  If I see any light in that room, it is too much light.
[07:01.840 --> 07:08.240]  We need 100% pitch black, total darkness in this night period.
[07:08.240 --> 07:13.120]  So when I say a light leak, I am talking about an interruption of the dark cycle.
[07:13.120 --> 07:16.760]  It could be opening the door and getting light from the other room in there.
[07:16.760 --> 07:20.480]  It could be a hole in some of your ducting or a hole in your tent that is letting light
[07:20.480 --> 07:23.180]  from the other room blatantly into there.
[07:23.180 --> 07:26.900]  You're going to see that light leak cause a hermaphroditic issue right where the light
[07:26.940 --> 07:28.060]  is hitting your bud.
[07:28.060 --> 07:31.340]  That one little bud is going to throw male flowers and it may pollinate.
[07:31.340 --> 07:32.820]  It may create seeds.
[07:32.820 --> 07:35.300]  So be very careful when it comes to light leaks.
[07:35.300 --> 07:37.900]  We do not want light leaks in our grow.
[07:37.900 --> 07:40.420]  I think I've talked about light leaks a lot.
[07:40.420 --> 07:43.460]  We want to stand in the grow room and make sure it is totally dark.
[07:43.460 --> 07:46.780]  If it is not totally dark, we need to correct that.
[07:46.780 --> 07:52.340]  Something you may notice is that some of the equipment in your grow room may be putting
[07:52.340 --> 07:53.600]  off lights.
[07:53.600 --> 07:57.060]  Some of the grow equipment that we buy has blue LED lighting on it.
[07:57.060 --> 07:58.800]  Some of it has red lighting on it.
[07:58.800 --> 08:04.760]  The only light that is acceptable in that grow room is a green LED light.
[08:04.760 --> 08:07.600]  Since plants are green, they are not affected by green light.
[08:07.600 --> 08:08.800]  They just reflect the green light.
[08:08.800 --> 08:09.800]  They don't even see it.
[08:09.800 --> 08:11.540]  They don't even know it's there.
[08:11.540 --> 08:16.640]  So if you've got a green LED light, that is the only light that is acceptable in your
[08:16.640 --> 08:17.640]  grow.
[08:17.640 --> 08:19.420]  A lot of us have equipment with a power light.
[08:19.420 --> 08:21.460]  When you plug it in, this little light comes on.
[08:21.460 --> 08:24.860]  If you've got a red light, if you've got a blue light on any of your equipment, it
[08:24.860 --> 08:29.300]  is time to get some black duct tape or something similar and cover that light up.
[08:29.300 --> 08:35.060]  We do not need any lights happening in our grow while the plants are trying to sleep.
[08:35.060 --> 08:36.760]  Cover up all those lights.
[08:36.760 --> 08:40.020]  If you've got a green light, that light will be acceptable.
[08:40.020 --> 08:46.260]  If it is an LED, we can use green LEDs, but don't use a white light with a green painted
[08:46.260 --> 08:47.260]  bubble over it.
[08:47.260 --> 08:48.660]  That is still going to cause problems.
[08:48.660 --> 08:50.300]  The light coming out is not really green.
[08:50.300 --> 08:51.660]  It's got a green bubble.
[08:51.660 --> 08:52.660]  It's not green light.
[08:52.660 --> 08:58.900]  So if you're using any sort of lights in there, it should be a green LED with green diodes,
[08:58.900 --> 09:01.500]  not green bulbs, not painted green bulbs.
[09:01.500 --> 09:07.540]  We actually want green light, not green glass to keep those plants in an uninterrupted dark
[09:07.540 --> 09:08.920]  cycle.
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.420]  Something that was brought to my attention is if you are using an AC Infinity fan speed
[09:14.420 --> 09:17.780]  controller, sometimes those will come on.
[09:17.780 --> 09:22.540]  The little controller box with the numbers on it, sometimes that comes on randomly.
[09:22.540 --> 09:24.900]  So you may think that that controller is off.
[09:24.900 --> 09:27.100]  There's a little button to turn off the lights.
[09:27.100 --> 09:31.580]  It's been brought to my attention that occasionally that thing will light up during the dark cycle
[09:31.580 --> 09:35.260]  and when you go in the grow room the next day, that light is on and you had no idea
[09:35.260 --> 09:36.540]  that that was on.
[09:36.540 --> 09:41.660]  So if you've got the AC Infinity fan speed controller with the display on it, you may
[09:41.660 --> 09:44.100]  want to make a little light baffle.
[09:44.100 --> 09:49.260]  You can simply get something like a piece of cardboard, a piece of a shoe box and just
[09:49.260 --> 09:52.620]  cut a little flap and tape that flap right over it so you can lift it up.
[09:52.620 --> 09:55.820]  You can adjust and look at your clock settings and look what you need to adjust.
[09:55.820 --> 09:57.420]  Put the flap right back down.
[09:57.420 --> 10:02.180]  Maybe you've got another creative method of doing so, but let's cover all of the equipment
[10:02.180 --> 10:06.680]  that is putting off LED red, blue, purple lighting in our grow room.
[10:06.680 --> 10:08.620]  We do not need that lighting in there.
[10:08.620 --> 10:10.500]  That is going to cause us problems.
[10:10.500 --> 10:12.860]  If it is a green LED, that is acceptable.
[10:12.860 --> 10:16.820]  Now I understand sometimes we do need to go in the grow room during the dark cycle
[10:16.820 --> 10:17.980]  and work.
[10:17.980 --> 10:19.020]  Maybe something happened.
[10:19.020 --> 10:22.820]  Maybe you're hanging out and you heard a weird bumping noise or maybe the air conditioner
[10:22.820 --> 10:25.460]  didn't come on or maybe you forgot something in there.
[10:25.460 --> 10:27.100]  Maybe you left your phone in there.
[10:27.100 --> 10:30.940]  Also if it is the dark period, don't be in there with your phone.
[10:30.940 --> 10:32.060]  That counts as light.
[10:32.060 --> 10:35.820]  I've seen people in the grow room and they're like, I'll just use my light as a flashlight
[10:35.820 --> 10:36.980]  and I won't disrupt the plants.
[10:36.980 --> 10:38.540]  Bro, that's a light.
[10:38.540 --> 10:39.540]  That is light.
[10:39.540 --> 10:40.840]  The plants are waking up from that.
[10:40.840 --> 10:42.340]  So don't answer your phone.
[10:42.340 --> 10:45.700]  Don't use your phone as a flashlight in the grow room in the dark period.
[10:45.700 --> 10:50.620]  If you're going to go in the grow during a dark period, I highly recommend having green
[10:50.620 --> 10:53.460]  LED lights as your work lights.
[10:53.460 --> 10:57.660]  It is a good idea just to replace every bulb in there with a green light.
[10:57.660 --> 10:59.660]  And you can't just use green light bulbs.
[10:59.660 --> 11:01.700]  They need to actually be putting out green light.
[11:01.700 --> 11:03.360]  Be very careful about that.
[11:03.360 --> 11:04.820]  Some of the painted bulbs I don't trust.
[11:04.820 --> 11:08.980]  I would definitely prefer a green diode LED light.
[11:08.980 --> 11:12.260]  So if you're going to work in there, get yourself a green light.
[11:12.260 --> 11:15.100]  A lot of people wear the headlamp with the green headlamp on it.
[11:15.100 --> 11:17.420]  That way the light is shining wherever you're looking.
[11:17.420 --> 11:19.000]  You can highlight your space.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  That is cool.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.740]  It kind of makes me feel weird in there like that.
[11:21.740 --> 11:26.140]  I would rather have the green LEDs above the above me so that I can see the room.
[11:26.140 --> 11:29.520]  Just something creepy about not being able to see over here, but only being able to see
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.740]  in front of me in the dark messes with my perception and just feels kind of creepy to
[11:33.740 --> 11:34.740]  be honest with you.
[11:34.740 --> 11:36.180]  I'm not afraid of the dark.
[11:36.180 --> 11:37.500]  Maybe I'm afraid of the dark.
[11:37.500 --> 11:40.300]  My point is do not interrupt that dark cycle.
[11:40.300 --> 11:44.180]  When you interrupt that dark cycle, that is what I am calling a light leak.
[11:44.180 --> 11:45.660]  It is fully dark in there.
[11:45.660 --> 11:47.100]  Now we've got some light coming in.
[11:47.100 --> 11:48.100]  That is a light leak.
[11:48.100 --> 11:50.660]  It's just like having an aquarium with a leak.
[11:50.660 --> 11:52.740]  The water is getting out or the water is getting in.
[11:52.740 --> 11:56.980]  We're getting air or I'm sorry, we're getting a light in or out when we don't want it.
[11:56.980 --> 12:00.500]  That is a light leak and it can cause great problems to your garden.
[12:00.500 --> 12:05.640]  Depending on your genetics, a small light leak could be seriously detrimental or a small
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.600]  light leak may be just a tiny problem, but let's avoid all of the problems we can by
[12:10.600 --> 12:13.080]  understanding light leaks and avoiding them.
[12:13.080 --> 12:14.960]  I think I covered that quite well.
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.440]  They'll cause hermaphrodites, they'll cause your plants not to flower and they can also
[12:18.440 --> 12:21.920]  cause your plant to go into a revege situation.
[12:21.920 --> 12:24.760]  Pay attention that some of your equipment may have lights on it.
[12:24.760 --> 12:29.600]  A lot of the fans we buy with a timer, if you can set a timer on your fan, it's probably
[12:29.600 --> 12:31.080]  got a red light on it.
[12:31.080 --> 12:34.020]  You've got to go and put some tape over that.
[12:34.020 --> 12:37.340]  Some of the extension cords we buy have lights on them.
[12:37.340 --> 12:41.420]  They got the little on off switch and it's either red or blue or whatever.
[12:41.420 --> 12:44.780]  You don't want that light switch or that little switch, the on off switch with the light on
[12:44.780 --> 12:45.780]  it.
[12:45.780 --> 12:46.780]  You don't want that.
[12:46.780 --> 12:49.820]  Some of the power strips that we buy light up when we plug them in.
[12:49.820 --> 12:52.780]  They're clear, thin, thin, clear plastic.
[12:52.780 --> 12:53.780]  That's what I meant.
[12:53.780 --> 12:55.740]  When you plug it in, the whole strip lights up.
[12:55.740 --> 12:56.740]  Get rid of that piece of shit.
[12:56.740 --> 12:58.200]  We don't want that in there.
[12:58.200 --> 13:02.660]  Get a dark colored power strip, a black one so the light won't shine through it.
[13:02.660 --> 13:06.540]  A lot of them have a little light on the end to indicate that they're giving you power.
[13:06.540 --> 13:10.100]  Take a screwdriver and fucking puncture that light bulb or put some tape over it or drill
[13:10.100 --> 13:12.740]  through it or get some pliers and pull it out.
[13:12.740 --> 13:13.740]  Ruin that light bulb.
[13:13.740 --> 13:15.480]  We don't need extra light in there.
[13:15.480 --> 13:21.140]  The only light we want is from our grow lights unless again, it is a green LED light.
[13:21.140 --> 13:23.100]  I feel like I covered that part excessively.
[13:23.100 --> 13:24.660]  I think I made my point.
[13:24.660 --> 13:29.180]  Light leaks are when we get light in in the dark period and it disrupts our plants.
[13:29.180 --> 13:34.060]  The next thing I want to touch on is watering technique.
[13:34.060 --> 13:38.220]  The other day I was helping somebody do a consultation for a grow and I said, just show
[13:38.220 --> 13:39.220]  me what you do in here.
[13:39.220 --> 13:43.380]  I just kind of hang out while they do their thing and I learn what is going wrong in their
[13:43.380 --> 13:45.580]  grow by watching what they're doing.
[13:45.580 --> 13:48.260]  I watched this person get their watering container.
[13:48.260 --> 13:52.740]  They just scoop water up out of a bucket and then they poured the water basically down
[13:52.740 --> 13:55.620]  the stock of the plant right into the middle of the pot.
[13:55.620 --> 13:59.820]  They got a seven gallon pot that's full of a, it was a soilless mix.
[13:59.820 --> 14:03.740]  So they got a, just, it's filled with a soilless mix, a seven gallons of media.
[14:03.740 --> 14:07.820]  They got a good size plant coming out of there and they are watering the direct center of
[14:07.820 --> 14:08.820]  the plant.
[14:08.820 --> 14:12.780]  So you got this big seven gallon pot and they just poured, I'm going to guess a seven gallon
[14:12.780 --> 14:14.980]  pot is 18 inches around.
[14:14.980 --> 14:16.020]  That's my guess.
[14:16.020 --> 14:17.020]  That's close enough.
[14:17.020 --> 14:20.980]  Even if I'm wrong, they watered a four to six inch circle in the middle.
[14:20.980 --> 14:26.540]  Now what about all this other 14, 10 inches on the outside that didn't get water?
[14:26.540 --> 14:28.060]  That's where all of our roots are growing.
[14:28.060 --> 14:30.460]  We want to fill that entire pot with roots.
[14:30.460 --> 14:34.740]  If you don't provide water to that outer edge, how is it going to get wet?
[14:34.740 --> 14:35.900]  What are the roots going to do?
[14:35.900 --> 14:37.020]  They're not going to grow out there.
[14:37.020 --> 14:41.980]  You're just going to have, I bet that my friend's plants only have root balls that are probably
[14:41.980 --> 14:48.700]  eight to 10 inches around and the depth of the pot when most people could achieve a full
[14:48.700 --> 14:49.940]  root bound pot.
[14:49.940 --> 14:53.020]  Their whole pot should be filled with roots by the time this plant is done.
[14:53.020 --> 14:55.820]  But if you're not watering it, those roots will not go there.
[14:55.820 --> 14:57.620]  There's no reason they're just dry.
[14:57.620 --> 14:58.780]  It's like, it's dry over there.
[14:58.780 --> 15:02.240]  Let's stay over here where it's wet because he's only watering in the middle.
[15:02.240 --> 15:03.820]  So think about this.
[15:03.820 --> 15:08.400]  Look at the shape of an untapped, untrained, unmanipulated cannabis plant.
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.060]  If you visualize that plant in your head, it's shaped like a Christmas tree, right?
[15:12.060 --> 15:15.220]  It's skinny at the top and it gets wider as it goes down.
[15:15.220 --> 15:16.540]  Think about the shape of the leaves.
[15:16.540 --> 15:21.140]  The leaves are hanging down a little bit, kind of acting like shingles on a roof.
[15:21.140 --> 15:25.540]  The one leaf hangs down at an angle and if water were to land on the top of the plant,
[15:25.540 --> 15:30.100]  the water would run down that top leaf and then it would fall onto another leaf and it
[15:30.100 --> 15:31.300]  would run down.
[15:31.300 --> 15:35.440]  And as it runs down, it is also moving outward because the branches are getting wider.
[15:35.440 --> 15:36.600]  The leaves are wider.
[15:36.600 --> 15:40.820]  It runs down and out and down and out until it gets to the bottom because of gravity.
[15:40.820 --> 15:42.400]  Where is that water going to end up?
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.120]  If we picture water falling from above on a cannabis plant, if you really think about
[15:47.120 --> 15:52.320]  it, everything directly underneath the plant will remain dry unless we get enough water.
[15:52.320 --> 15:56.680]  What's going to happen is the area right around the plant where those leaves stretch out to,
[15:56.680 --> 15:59.760]  all of that is going to get heavily saturated with water.
[15:59.760 --> 16:03.020]  Then those roots are going to say, look at all this water out here and they're going
[16:03.020 --> 16:06.800]  to grow and they're going to expand and they're going to keep stretching out until they don't
[16:06.800 --> 16:08.720]  see any more water.
[16:08.720 --> 16:12.120]  What's going to happen in your container is they're going to go right up to the wall and
[16:12.120 --> 16:14.800]  they're going to circle back around and they're going to keep circling in there and you will
[16:14.800 --> 16:20.720]  fill that entire container with big fat white roots and big fat white roots will give you
[16:20.720 --> 16:23.320]  big fat green fruits.
[16:23.320 --> 16:27.920]  If you've got a big fat healthy root system, you can create a bigger, fatter, healthier
[16:27.920 --> 16:28.920]  plant.
[16:28.920 --> 16:33.600]  So when you are watering, my point of this is don't water the very center of the plant.
[16:33.600 --> 16:35.480]  Water the outside edge of the plant.
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.600]  If you've got a new plant, a baby plant that's just adjusting to its space, yes, water in
[16:39.600 --> 16:43.720]  the middle where the plant is, but as it grows, as the roots grow, as the root mass
[16:43.720 --> 16:48.480]  expands, water outward, water more of that space where the fresh roots are.
[16:48.480 --> 16:50.440]  You may need to increase the amount of water.
[16:50.440 --> 16:54.560]  My buddy was only pouring enough water in to actually water the area where the plant
[16:54.560 --> 16:56.000]  probably exists.
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.360]  I told him if he watered the entire thing and got about 10 to 20% runoff, the roots
[17:00.360 --> 17:05.760]  would grow more rapidly, more vigorously, and it would just fill and occupy that entire
[17:05.760 --> 17:06.760]  area.
[17:06.760 --> 17:10.080]  Which would give them a healthier, happier plant, which produces bigger, fatter buds.
[17:10.080 --> 17:12.160]  And that's what we are all after, right?
[17:12.160 --> 17:13.880]  If you're going to do it, do it right.
[17:13.880 --> 17:18.680]  So stop watering the dead center of the plant and let's start watering outward so that all
[17:18.680 --> 17:22.960]  of those roots can get some moisture and get a little bit of a drink.
[17:22.960 --> 17:26.320]  I've got one more quick thing I want to rant about, and then we're going to wrap this one
[17:26.320 --> 17:27.320]  up.
[17:27.320 --> 17:30.800]  Something I saw on social media was somebody asking about a new brand of soil they can
[17:30.800 --> 17:36.440]  buy because this brand that they have been buying is riddled with bugs.
[17:36.440 --> 17:38.640]  They wanted to blame the brand of soil.
[17:38.640 --> 17:42.040]  And then a couple of people wanted to back them up on the Facebook feed because that's
[17:42.040 --> 17:44.000]  how social media works.
[17:44.000 --> 17:50.000]  But I want to say that you cannot blame any brand of soil for having bugs in it because
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.100]  all brands of soil can potentially and probably do have bugs in there.
[17:56.100 --> 17:57.580]  It's not happening at the factory.
[17:57.580 --> 18:00.120]  It's not happening where the soil is made.
[18:00.120 --> 18:05.520]  It could be, but most likely it's happening somewhere in shipping or in a storage dock.
[18:05.520 --> 18:08.880]  I'm sure that the people that make that soil do their best to keep it bug free.
[18:08.880 --> 18:10.960]  They want you to have success.
[18:10.960 --> 18:13.360]  But these bags of soil are made in bulk.
[18:13.360 --> 18:14.640]  They're made in mass.
[18:14.640 --> 18:17.900]  They've got to sit on a dock or in a warehouse or somewhere.
[18:17.900 --> 18:22.820]  I've been to a few grow stores where they store the soil in the backyard, just right
[18:22.820 --> 18:24.760]  on the dirt in the backyard.
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.820]  And there will be a stack of your favorite soil, just two pallets of it stacked up eight
[18:29.820 --> 18:30.860]  feet tall.
[18:30.860 --> 18:34.980]  Then right next to that will be two pallets stacked up eight feet tall of my favorite
[18:34.980 --> 18:35.980]  soil.
[18:35.980 --> 18:39.640]  Then right next to that will be another soil that neither one of us have ever heard of,
[18:39.640 --> 18:43.780]  but it's stacked up eight feet tall on two pallets and it's all out in the backyard of
[18:43.780 --> 18:47.540]  this grow store or out in the backyard of this warehouse because they can't store it
[18:47.540 --> 18:50.100]  all indoors and soil can be stored outdoors.
[18:50.100 --> 18:51.100]  That's safe.
[18:51.100 --> 18:52.100]  They got a fence.
[18:52.100 --> 18:53.100]  No one's going to steal it.
[18:53.100 --> 18:56.940]  But when all of that shit is sitting outdoors, that's when it is getting bugs.
[18:56.940 --> 19:00.220]  And do you think that the bugs are going to just say, I want this dirt?
[19:00.220 --> 19:02.020]  They're going to go, no, there's a home over here.
[19:02.020 --> 19:03.740]  There's a home here and there's a home here.
[19:03.740 --> 19:05.840]  They're going to get into all those bags of dirt.
[19:05.840 --> 19:06.840]  And then what are they going to do?
[19:06.840 --> 19:07.840]  They're going to breed.
[19:07.840 --> 19:09.220]  They've got a comfy environment.
[19:09.220 --> 19:10.340]  They're in a bag.
[19:10.340 --> 19:11.440]  It's nice and cozy in there.
[19:11.440 --> 19:12.900]  It's warm, it's dry.
[19:12.900 --> 19:13.900]  They're going to start partying.
[19:13.900 --> 19:14.900]  They're going to want to eat.
[19:14.900 --> 19:18.340]  They're going to want to hump and they're going to reproduce.
[19:18.340 --> 19:22.100]  Maybe there were only bugs in pile a at the beginning, but after a little bit of eating
[19:22.100 --> 19:25.840]  and reproducing, they wanted to go find more people to eat and reproduce with.
[19:25.840 --> 19:27.280]  Now they're in pile two.
[19:27.280 --> 19:28.840]  Now they're in pile three.
[19:28.840 --> 19:33.760]  So the bugs are not in one specific brand of soil or soilless mix.
[19:33.760 --> 19:37.660]  The bugs are moving around in all of the brands of soil and soilless mix.
[19:37.660 --> 19:39.260]  It's happening in the warehouse.
[19:39.260 --> 19:40.640]  It's happening in the dock.
[19:40.640 --> 19:41.900]  It's happening in transport.
[19:41.900 --> 19:43.400]  It's happening in shipping.
[19:43.400 --> 19:48.360]  There are so many opportunities for these bugs to jump into the soil bags and we cannot
[19:48.360 --> 19:50.040]  blame the soil company.
[19:50.040 --> 19:51.040]  It's happening.
[19:51.040 --> 19:53.720]  It may not even happen anywhere near the soil company.
[19:53.720 --> 19:57.000]  It may have happened at the grocery store that sold it to you, which is as far down
[19:57.000 --> 19:59.240]  the line from the company as you can get.
[19:59.240 --> 20:04.280]  So let's stop blaming the companies for having bugs in the soil or soilless mix.
[20:04.280 --> 20:08.460]  That is something that you should expect from all companies.
[20:08.460 --> 20:13.440]  And as a farmer, it is your responsibility to make sure there are no pests.
[20:13.440 --> 20:18.120]  And if there are pests, it's your responsibility to treat appropriately to ensure that those
[20:18.120 --> 20:20.200]  pests don't infest our garden.
[20:20.200 --> 20:23.320]  That is the responsibility of the gardener.
[20:23.320 --> 20:28.120]  I can't put a bag of dirt in a bag and ship it across the country on a truck and have
[20:28.120 --> 20:31.520]  it sit in a dock and promise you that no bugs can get to that.
[20:31.520 --> 20:32.520]  That is impossible.
[20:32.520 --> 20:37.700]  Therefore, it is the growers responsibility to make sure that the things we put into our
[20:37.700 --> 20:41.400]  garden are clean and safe and pest free.
[20:41.400 --> 20:43.400]  So inspect your soil.
[20:43.400 --> 20:47.000]  If you get soil and you see things flying out of it, you've obviously got some fungus
[20:47.000 --> 20:48.000]  gnats.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.360]  You can't see a lot of the insects until it's too late, but pay close attention.
[20:52.400 --> 20:56.160]  If you do see any soil borne pests, it is time to treat that soil.
[20:56.160 --> 20:59.240]  A lot of people wonder, how can I get the bugs out of my soil?
[20:59.240 --> 21:01.000]  There are several ways to do that.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.760]  The most common, you can use predator bugs.
[21:03.760 --> 21:04.880]  That is very common.
[21:04.880 --> 21:10.160]  The most common way to get rid of most bugs in a commercial environment is to use Bt,
[21:10.160 --> 21:11.920]  Bacillus thuringiensis.
[21:11.920 --> 21:12.920]  I hope I said that right.
[21:12.920 --> 21:16.800]  I do not have that printed anywhere, but that is the most common way to get rid of most
[21:16.800 --> 21:18.320]  pests in soil.
[21:18.320 --> 21:21.440]  That product is available in many different forms.
[21:21.520 --> 21:23.400]  Mosquito dunks are very affordable.
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.160]  There are these products called mosquito dunks.
[21:25.160 --> 21:28.240]  You can find them at your local hardware stores.
[21:28.240 --> 21:29.880]  Target probably has them.
[21:29.880 --> 21:31.960]  The grocery store probably has them.
[21:31.960 --> 21:36.640]  They come on a red package with yellow writing, yellow and white writing, and it simply says
[21:36.640 --> 21:37.640]  mosquito dunk.
[21:37.640 --> 21:41.920]  They look like a little donut or a shitty cookie, but do not eat them.
[21:41.920 --> 21:47.320]  It is a beneficial fungus, and I think they are delivered on, I think it's like ground
[21:47.320 --> 21:55.920]  corn or some sort of a grain, but it's dried and it's got this bacteria on it.
[21:55.920 --> 22:02.240]  You get these donut shaped disks, and I usually put them in a baggie, and I wrap the baggie
[22:02.240 --> 22:04.640]  in a newspaper, and I crush it with a hammer.
[22:04.640 --> 22:05.760]  I do not beat the shit out of it.
[22:05.760 --> 22:08.520]  I do not want to break the baggie and rupture the paper.
[22:08.520 --> 22:11.640]  I just want to hit it hard enough to crumble it up into a dust.
[22:11.640 --> 22:16.360]  Then I put that dust into my water that I am going to water my plants, and then I water
[22:16.400 --> 22:22.000]  that through the soil, and that puts the BT into my soil, and that will destroy, eradicate
[22:22.000 --> 22:25.640]  most of the bugs that come with your soil.
[22:25.640 --> 22:30.400]  If the BT doesn't get rid of them, that's when I recommend doing either an evergreen
[22:30.400 --> 22:34.120]  or Botanigard Max soil dredge.
[22:34.120 --> 22:38.600]  You can mix up the appropriate amount of pesticide, depending on which pesticide you've chosen
[22:38.600 --> 22:39.720]  to use.
[22:39.720 --> 22:43.960]  Mix that up with some water, and simply feed that through your plants until you get slight
[22:43.960 --> 22:44.960]  runoff.
[22:45.040 --> 22:47.840]  You've got that pesticide in there in the root zone.
[22:47.840 --> 22:49.160]  Hopefully your plants are nice and healthy.
[22:49.160 --> 22:50.400]  You didn't cause too much damage.
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.640]  It will only take a day or two for them to recover.
[22:53.640 --> 22:59.400]  Continue on with your normal watering cycle, and hopefully one or two soil dredges of either
[22:59.400 --> 23:05.560]  Botanigard Max or evergreen will eradicate almost any soil-borne pest.
[23:05.560 --> 23:08.060]  Also, you may want to spray at the same time.
[23:08.060 --> 23:11.400]  If you think you've got a soil-borne pest, if you think you've got thrips in there, if
[23:11.400 --> 23:15.640]  you think you've got spider mites, spray at the same time as you do your dredge.
[23:15.640 --> 23:16.640]  Hit them from all angles.
[23:16.640 --> 23:19.640]  That way those bugs have nowhere to go, and you win.
[23:19.640 --> 23:26.120]  But we have got to stop blaming soil companies, cocoa companies, for sabotaging our gardens
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.040]  because we got bugs in a bag of soil.
[23:29.040 --> 23:30.760]  Expect the bugs in the bag of soil.
[23:30.760 --> 23:31.760]  They should be there.
[23:31.760 --> 23:34.960]  That's what happens in shipping and transport and storage.
[23:34.960 --> 23:35.960]  Expect that.
[23:35.960 --> 23:37.960]  It's your responsibility as the gardener to get rid of that.
[23:37.960 --> 23:38.960]  All right.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.520]  I'm going to take a sip, and I'm going to talk about one more thing.
[23:42.520 --> 23:43.520]  Here we go.
[23:43.520 --> 23:47.820]  Sips water.
[23:47.820 --> 23:51.360]  The other thing I want to talk about is rinsing our cocoa.
[23:51.360 --> 23:56.020]  When you get bags of cocoa, that cocoa has been ... It came from another country, probably
[23:56.020 --> 23:58.340]  Malaysia, Thailand, something like that.
[23:58.340 --> 24:00.300]  That cocoa came on a boat.
[24:00.300 --> 24:04.540]  Who knows when they packed up that cocoa if they used salt water or if it was on a boat
[24:04.540 --> 24:07.380]  that got a lot of condensation.
[24:07.380 --> 24:10.820]  Sometimes the cocoa we get is filled with salt.
[24:11.260 --> 24:13.220]  We need to rinse the cocoa before we use it.
[24:13.220 --> 24:14.980]  We've got several ways of doing that.
[24:14.980 --> 24:19.040]  You can put all of your cocoa into a giant container and just hose it down and just rinse
[24:19.040 --> 24:20.740]  it until you get runoff.
[24:20.740 --> 24:24.700]  Or you can put it in the pots that you're going to plant your plants into.
[24:24.700 --> 24:26.280]  You can mix it with perlite.
[24:26.280 --> 24:28.480]  You can put the perlite and the amendments in there.
[24:28.480 --> 24:32.420]  Then you can put it directly into your pots, your threes, your fives, or your sevens, whatever
[24:32.420 --> 24:33.820]  you're using.
[24:33.820 --> 24:37.900]  Then rinse that while it's in the pot until you get plenty of runoff.
[24:37.980 --> 24:42.500]  I would almost check to see what the PPMs or EC of that runoff is.
[24:42.500 --> 24:43.500]  Get it super low.
[24:43.500 --> 24:47.820]  Make sure there's not a lot of salt in there before we put our plants in there.
[24:47.820 --> 24:51.940]  If you did not rinse your cocoa and you put your plants in the cocoa and you were seeing
[24:51.940 --> 24:56.240]  weird problems with your plants, if they're getting kind of clawy, if the leaves are going
[24:56.240 --> 24:59.900]  different directions, you're getting whirled leaves, or if you're getting odd colors, you're
[24:59.900 --> 25:04.780]  getting crispiness, it's probably because there was a bunch of salt in that cocoa and
[25:04.780 --> 25:06.140]  the plants are pissed off.
[25:06.140 --> 25:07.620]  They need to get rinsed out.
[25:07.620 --> 25:09.140]  They just ate all of the salt.
[25:09.140 --> 25:13.340]  Just imagine what your mouth tastes like if you were just buried in salt.
[25:13.340 --> 25:16.740]  So now we got to hydrate the plants, get the salt out of there, and start feeding them
[25:16.740 --> 25:17.780]  an appropriate diet.
[25:17.780 --> 25:22.380]  That salt's going to mess with your pH, your EC, and the overall health of your plants.
[25:22.380 --> 25:26.420]  So please rinse your cocoa before using it.
[25:26.420 --> 25:30.020]  Some of the higher end brands don't require as much rinsing, but I still do recommend
[25:30.020 --> 25:33.620]  a quick rinse, whatever brand you choose to use.
[25:33.620 --> 25:34.620]  All right.
[25:34.620 --> 25:37.020]  I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[25:37.020 --> 25:38.020]  I know it was short.
[25:38.020 --> 25:39.020]  I know it was quick.
[25:39.020 --> 25:41.620]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with fresh new content.
[25:41.620 --> 25:46.380]  I'm going to get back onto all of those Patreon questions, and those do make for long episodes,
[25:46.380 --> 25:47.380]  so have no fear.
[25:47.380 --> 25:51.260]  We'll get some long episodes coming up really soon, probably the next show.
[25:51.260 --> 25:52.260]  All right.
