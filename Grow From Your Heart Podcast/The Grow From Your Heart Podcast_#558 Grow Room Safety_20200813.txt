[00:00.320 --> 00:13.860]  Here we go.
[00:13.860 --> 00:14.860]  Welcome back podcast world.
[00:14.860 --> 00:19.160]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 558 of the
[00:19.160 --> 00:21.560]  Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:59.500 --> 01:03.540]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:03.540 --> 01:08.580]  Today I've been taking dabs of Reba Jam live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:08.580 --> 01:11.880]  This is a blend of Jelly 13 and I-95.
[01:11.880 --> 01:15.840]  On the package, the flavor is described as tangerine and sour fuel.
[01:15.840 --> 01:17.520]  I think I completely agree with that.
[01:17.520 --> 01:22.340]  When I crack open the jar, I am greeted by a sweet tangerine aroma, and that is followed
[01:22.340 --> 01:24.240]  by a funky, sour fuel.
[01:24.240 --> 01:28.220]  When I take dabs of it, I definitely taste that sour fuel.
[01:28.220 --> 01:31.840]  If I dab it nice and cool, the orange flavor and aroma comes in a little bit more.
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.800]  If I go too hot, it is definitely sour and funky.
[01:35.800 --> 01:41.820]  On the back of the package, it says the product does contain 64.08% THC and non-detectable
[01:41.820 --> 01:43.580]  amounts of CBD.
[01:43.580 --> 01:49.060]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Reba Jam live batter.
[01:49.060 --> 01:53.860]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to read an email about Grow Room safety, but
[01:53.860 --> 01:57.980]  before we get there, let's do some shout outs to the 710 Club.
[01:57.980 --> 02:00.180]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:00.180 --> 02:01.900]  Thank you shout out to my friend Eric Ross.
[02:01.900 --> 02:04.980]  I also want to send a big thank you shout out to Grow Man Stan.

[02:10.880 --> 02:14.480]  I also have a big thank you for EZ057.
[02:14.480 --> 02:16.240]  Let's say thanks to Popperoni.

[02:19.560 --> 02:24.040]  I've always got a Grow From Your Heart podcast high five and a thank you for my friend Tommy.
[02:24.040 --> 02:26.960]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to ADHD Grower.
[02:26.960 --> 02:29.200]  Let's send a big high five to Steven Smith.
[02:29.200 --> 02:32.320]  I've always got a big thank you shout out for Pacific Northwest Dan.
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.920]  That was hard for my brain to read.
[02:33.940 --> 02:36.900]  I've also got a big thank you shout out to our buddy Lemur Priest.
[02:36.900 --> 02:39.700]  I've always got a big thank you shout out to Aaron Barajas.
[02:39.700 --> 02:46.820]  And last but certainly not least, let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to our friend Eric L.

[03:03.480 --> 03:07.480]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes to make it nice and easy.
[03:07.480 --> 03:14.440]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pips and hoes and friends and foes, smokers and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers.
[03:14.440 --> 03:18.200]  This is the portion of the show where I start reading listener emails.
[03:18.200 --> 03:20.360]  Today we're going to focus on grow room safety.
[03:20.360 --> 03:23.080]  That was brought to my attention by a listener named Brandy.
[03:23.080 --> 03:26.520]  I'm going to jump right into their email and it goes like this.
[03:26.520 --> 03:29.480]  What's up Rasta Jeff? Feel free to use my name.
[03:29.480 --> 03:32.680]  Thank you for that info right at the start of the message. It makes it so easy.
[03:32.860 --> 03:37.820]  It goes on to say, I've been listening to your podcast since last fall when a dude at my local
[03:37.820 --> 03:42.220]  grow shop gave me your podcast info and the DGC info.
[03:42.220 --> 03:47.340]  I'm so thankful to him for that because your podcast has helped me learn so much.
[03:47.340 --> 03:49.500]  Yeah, big thank you to that guy at the grow store.
[03:49.500 --> 03:53.820]  I'm glad he introduced you to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and the Dude Grow Show.
[03:53.820 --> 03:58.140]  If you guys aren't already watching the Dude Grow Show, I highly encourage you to check them out.
[03:58.140 --> 04:01.980]  If you're watching me on YouTube, if you're listening on Apple podcast or Spotify,
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.080]  the Dude Grow Show is available wherever you're watching or listening to me.
[04:06.080 --> 04:09.520]  Just go to the service, go to the search bar, type in Dude Grow.
[04:09.520 --> 04:12.800]  You'll find that podcast. I highly recommend it. You will enjoy it.
[04:12.800 --> 04:14.320]  Shout out to my friends in the DGC.
[04:14.960 --> 04:17.680]  I want to keep going because that Reba gem got me chattery.
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.760]  It says, you taught me not only about cannabis, but about safety.
[04:21.760 --> 04:23.360]  This is where the message gets interesting.
[04:23.360 --> 04:28.640]  It says, last night after putting our two kids to bed, my wife came downstairs and found water
[04:28.640 --> 04:31.280]  running all the way down into our living room.
[04:31.300 --> 04:34.180]  We just bought this house last year and we have done a lot of work on it,
[04:34.180 --> 04:38.340]  including new laminate flooring, which was water resistant, thankfully.
[04:38.340 --> 04:43.140]  And I was completely horrified to come downstairs and see water everywhere.
[04:43.140 --> 04:44.820]  That's got to be a scary sight.
[04:44.820 --> 04:47.860]  It says, I ran to our basement to grab the shop vac and there were
[04:47.860 --> 04:49.860]  waterfalls coming from the ceiling.
[04:50.740 --> 04:52.500]  That made me feel a certain way when you said that.
[04:52.500 --> 04:56.020]  My stomach moved. I got a little drop in my gut. My chest felt tight.
[04:56.020 --> 05:00.180]  Waterfalls coming from the ceiling is never a good thing unless you paid extra for that.
[05:00.200 --> 05:03.160]  It is 99% of the time a major fucking problem.
[05:04.120 --> 05:06.200]  Horrified isn't even a strong enough word.
[05:06.200 --> 05:07.080]  I agree with you.
[05:07.080 --> 05:10.520]  I'm feeling panic inside right now and it's not even my house or my grow.
[05:11.160 --> 05:15.000]  It says, sheer panic took over and I ran to the grow room to find it
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.760]  completely dry and the flooding water hadn't crept that far.
[05:18.760 --> 05:23.000]  I had a bit of water from another part, but it was very little, thankfully.
[05:23.000 --> 05:26.680]  Sounds like this could have been much worse and I'm really glad it wasn't too bad for you.
[05:26.700 --> 05:31.660]  It goes on to say, I had just revamped the grow last month, which included switching out lights,
[05:31.660 --> 05:36.140]  caulking and sealing everything super tight and we repainted.
[05:36.140 --> 05:40.220]  I was also very mindful to place all cords and electronics up high.
[05:40.220 --> 05:41.420]  That is a good step.
[05:41.420 --> 05:43.980]  I talked about that in a previous episode, but we'll get there in a minute.
[05:45.180 --> 05:48.860]  The electronics are hanging from hooks or sitting on a tall shelf.
[05:48.860 --> 05:52.780]  And I can say that the likelihood of doing that on my own is slim.
[05:52.800 --> 05:55.280]  So without your knowledge, without your podcast and without
[05:56.000 --> 05:58.880]  your talking about how important safety is in the grow room,
[05:58.880 --> 06:02.400]  I can't say I would have given the safety much thought, if any.
[06:03.680 --> 06:05.760]  This sounds asinine and kind of crazy.
[06:05.760 --> 06:09.840]  We have the cords and shit all over sometimes, which I've gone around and placed on top of
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.760]  tables and desks and off the floor.
[06:11.760 --> 06:14.560]  We'll never have them on the floor again, thanks to you.
[06:15.840 --> 06:21.040]  You seem like a fucking stand-up guy and I hope to get to meet you and give you a hug at some point next year.
[06:21.060 --> 06:25.060]  I hope when all this quarantine and weirdness goes away that I get to meet a lot of people
[06:25.060 --> 06:26.020]  and get a lot of hugs.
[06:26.020 --> 06:27.140]  I look forward to it.
[06:27.140 --> 06:30.660]  It says, sorry for this long ass email, but I thought you'd enjoy this story.
[06:30.660 --> 06:31.860]  I mean, it's crazy, right?
[06:31.860 --> 06:32.740]  Yes, it is crazy.
[06:32.740 --> 06:37.460]  So crazy that it has inspired a redo of the grow room safety episode.
[06:37.460 --> 06:38.900]  It says, anyway, take care.
[06:38.900 --> 06:41.300]  Stay safe as hell during this crazy pandemic.
[06:41.300 --> 06:42.260]  Attached is a video.
[06:42.260 --> 06:43.620]  I did watch that video.
[06:43.620 --> 06:45.060]  It gave me a panic attack.
[06:45.060 --> 06:47.300]  There was just water falling from this person's ceiling.
[06:47.300 --> 06:49.300]  Lots of water everywhere and places it shouldn't be.
[06:49.320 --> 06:51.080]  I see exactly what you're talking about.
[06:51.080 --> 06:53.480]  So they wrap it up and it says from Brandy.
[06:53.480 --> 06:57.080]  Now that has inspired a grow room safety lesson.
[06:57.080 --> 07:01.640]  The reason Brandy was smart enough and aware to keep their electronics up off the floor
[07:01.640 --> 07:05.160]  is because I did an episode in the past, but we are now on a video format.
[07:05.160 --> 07:09.480]  So it's time to do a refresher of the grow room safety course.
[07:10.680 --> 07:12.200]  Let's talk about basic safety.
[07:12.760 --> 07:17.240]  There are a lot of things we can hurt ourselves, potentially make ourselves sick with in a grow room.
[07:17.260 --> 07:19.900]  Always think about personal protective equipment.
[07:19.900 --> 07:21.420]  That is the first place to start.
[07:21.420 --> 07:24.140]  Before you go in there, do you have the right stuff on?
[07:24.140 --> 07:25.340]  Are you wearing the right shit?
[07:25.340 --> 07:26.860]  You should have gloves on.
[07:26.860 --> 07:29.820]  I know you're just going in there to look at the plants, but if you're going to touch a plant,
[07:29.820 --> 07:32.300]  if you're going to touch a bottle, put on some gloves.
[07:32.860 --> 07:36.860]  Six millimeter or thicker nitrile gloves are what I recommend.
[07:36.860 --> 07:37.580]  Wear gloves.
[07:38.220 --> 07:43.980]  You probably, I don't know what you're doing in your grow, but possibly you have applied a pesticide to those plants.
[07:43.980 --> 07:46.860]  When you sprayed that pesticide, it didn't just hit the plants.
[07:46.960 --> 07:49.520]  It hit the walls, it hit the ceiling, it hit the doorknobs.
[07:49.520 --> 07:51.360]  It hit everywhere in that room.
[07:51.360 --> 07:53.760]  So now you're going to go in there and touch shit in that room.
[07:53.760 --> 07:55.920]  You're going to pick up pesticides off the walls.
[07:55.920 --> 07:58.000]  You're going to get pesticides off the doorknob.
[07:58.000 --> 08:00.720]  There are probably pesticides in places you didn't think about.
[08:00.720 --> 08:02.160]  Don't get that on your hands.
[08:02.160 --> 08:03.200]  Then it's your face.
[08:03.200 --> 08:04.720]  Then you're going to get a big rash on your face.
[08:04.720 --> 08:06.160]  You're going to look like a fucking freak.
[08:06.160 --> 08:07.280]  Don't do that to yourself.
[08:07.280 --> 08:09.600]  Wear protective gloves in the grow.
[08:09.600 --> 08:12.160]  Another thing to think about, don't touch your face.
[08:12.160 --> 08:15.200]  If you got the gloves on, don't hit your face with those gloves on.
[08:15.220 --> 08:18.340]  If your face itches, take the gloves off, scratch your face, get new gloves.
[08:18.340 --> 08:20.500]  Let's not contaminate ourselves with pesticides.
[08:20.500 --> 08:26.340]  Also, in a previous episode, we heard about a listener who gets rashes just from coming in contact with the plants.
[08:26.340 --> 08:27.780]  So wear gloves.
[08:27.780 --> 08:34.340]  Let's not give ourselves any rashes from the plants themselves or the pesticides or any other foliar feeds we may have applied to the grow.
[08:34.900 --> 08:39.940]  Along with rubber gloves, I recommend long sleeves in a grow environment.
[08:39.940 --> 08:41.060]  I know it's hot in there.
[08:41.060 --> 08:43.620]  It's not the perfect environment for wearing long sleeves.
[08:43.640 --> 08:46.280]  But you don't want to get that pesticide on your arms.
[08:46.280 --> 08:51.000]  Like I talked about a moment ago, we had a listener who got a rash just from touching the plants.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.400]  If you're wearing long sleeves, that's not an option.
[08:53.400 --> 08:54.520]  So wear long sleeves.
[08:54.520 --> 08:55.960]  It can be something real thin.
[08:55.960 --> 09:00.440]  If you just got like a light, like a light little linen, just a button down shirt to put on, you still look nice.
[09:00.440 --> 09:02.200]  You look good in there and you're protecting your arms.
[09:02.200 --> 09:03.720]  If you're a hoodie guy, wear a hoodie.
[09:03.720 --> 09:06.440]  If you're a long sleeve shirt guy, wear a long sleeve shirt.
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.640]  If you're a guy or a gal that doesn't want to cover up your sleeves, you can run that risk of getting a pesticide on your arm.
[09:11.660 --> 09:16.380]  You can run the risk of getting the rash, but I highly recommend gloves and long sleeves.
[09:17.020 --> 09:18.460]  Hopefully you're wearing pants.
[09:18.460 --> 09:20.860]  A lot of the times I see people wearing shorts in the grow.
[09:20.860 --> 09:23.820]  I guess that's acceptable unless you're spraying a pesticide.
[09:23.820 --> 09:26.380]  If you are applying something, be completely covered.
[09:26.380 --> 09:27.260]  I know it's hot in there.
[09:27.260 --> 09:28.540]  We got our arms covered up.
[09:28.540 --> 09:31.100]  It's less likely that our legs are going to brush up against plants.
[09:31.100 --> 09:33.580]  But if they do, I recommend you wear pants.
[09:34.140 --> 09:37.180]  Also, always have good shoes.
[09:37.180 --> 09:38.780]  I know, shoes.
[09:38.780 --> 09:40.780]  A lot of us want to be barefoot in a grow.
[09:40.800 --> 09:42.960]  A lot of us want to run around and feel the dirt.
[09:42.960 --> 09:43.600]  That's cool.
[09:43.600 --> 09:46.240]  If that's your grow, if that's what you want to do, go for that.
[09:46.240 --> 09:48.880]  I highly recommend shoes for several reasons.
[09:49.680 --> 09:51.840]  First of all, let's think about pesticides.
[09:51.840 --> 09:56.080]  If you were in an indoor environment and you have applied a pesticide, where does it all land?
[09:56.080 --> 09:59.920]  Anything that dripped off the plants, anything that wasn't caught in the air is on the floor.
[09:59.920 --> 10:04.320]  If you were barefoot, you were rubbing your bare feet on that pesticide laden floor,
[10:04.320 --> 10:06.080]  unless you have mopped since the pesticides.
[10:06.080 --> 10:09.680]  But if you're in there barefoot, I'm imagining you're not a mopping kind of person as well.
[10:09.700 --> 10:13.780]  You're barefoot in that dirty grow room, collecting pesticides on the bottoms of your feet.
[10:13.780 --> 10:17.380]  The bottoms of your feet are one of the most absorbent parts of your body.
[10:17.380 --> 10:21.300]  If you want to get a pesticide toxicity, just pour it onto the bottoms of your feet.
[10:21.300 --> 10:22.660]  It'll absorb really quickly.
[10:22.660 --> 10:24.100]  It's a good way to get yourself sick.
[10:24.100 --> 10:29.060]  So I recommend shoes in there to keep yourself away from the pesticides that could be on the floor.
[10:29.060 --> 10:34.260]  Also, anything else you may have spilled, a nutrient, a nutrient bottle, a nutrient solution,
[10:34.260 --> 10:36.020]  that's on the floor getting into your feet.
[10:36.020 --> 10:36.980]  Can't be good for you.
[10:36.980 --> 10:38.420]  Also not good for your skin.
[10:38.420 --> 10:38.980]  I get it.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.080]  I used to be a major hippie too when I was younger.
[10:41.080 --> 10:42.600]  Now I wear shoes in the grow.
[10:42.600 --> 10:44.200]  What if you drop something on your feet?
[10:44.200 --> 10:45.080]  That's gonna suck.
[10:45.080 --> 10:46.360]  You're out of work for a day or two.
[10:46.360 --> 10:47.480]  You don't want that to happen.
[10:47.480 --> 10:49.320]  Just wear some shoes is my advice.
[10:49.320 --> 10:52.600]  If you're in a commercial grow, you better be wearing closed toed shoes.
[10:52.600 --> 10:55.800]  If you show up to my commercial grow in flip-flops or sandals, guess what?
[10:55.800 --> 10:58.440]  Better go to the car and find some good shoes or go home and get some good ones
[10:58.440 --> 11:00.360]  because you're not wearing that shit in my commercial grow.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.480]  Protect yourselves, you guys.
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.800]  Also, wear, if you're around any sort of sprays, if you are mixing pesticides,
[11:07.820 --> 11:10.780]  if you're mixing nutrients, I recommend some sort of goggles.
[11:10.780 --> 11:16.300]  I know that sounds excessive, but your eyes are the most sensitive organ in your body
[11:16.300 --> 11:18.460]  that are exposed to the outside elements.
[11:18.460 --> 11:20.700]  I could poke you anywhere on the chest and the arms.
[11:20.700 --> 11:21.100]  You're gonna be cool.
[11:21.100 --> 11:23.820]  But if I get right in your eye one time, it fucking sucks, dude.
[11:23.820 --> 11:24.860]  Protect your eyes.
[11:24.860 --> 11:25.740]  Wear some goggles.
[11:25.740 --> 11:28.860]  Wear something over your eyes when you're mixing and spraying.
[11:28.860 --> 11:32.540]  Anytime, if you're gonna reach for a pesticide or a nutrient bottle,
[11:32.540 --> 11:35.260]  right before you reach for that, put on gloves and goggles.
[11:35.280 --> 11:38.000]  It's really easy, especially in a commercial environment.
[11:38.000 --> 11:42.160]  A lot of times, if I see you not using the appropriate personal protective equipment
[11:42.160 --> 11:44.400]  in a commercial grow, you get to take a little break.
[11:44.400 --> 11:47.360]  You get to come up to the office and hang out with me while I write out a report
[11:47.360 --> 11:50.480]  on how you are failing to wear the products that I have assigned.
[11:50.480 --> 11:51.520]  Keep yourself safe, you guys.
[11:51.520 --> 11:53.520]  This isn't just because it looks cool.
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.800]  It's not just because we're nerdy.
[11:54.800 --> 11:57.600]  We want you to be safe and healthy.
[11:57.600 --> 12:03.440]  I have a friend who was mixing nutrients by himself and he got pH down in his eye.
[12:04.420 --> 12:05.540]  He wasn't wearing goggles.
[12:05.540 --> 12:06.740]  He wasn't wearing gloves.
[12:06.740 --> 12:07.620]  He got pH down.
[12:07.620 --> 12:10.820]  He got pH down on his hand and rubbed it into his eye is what he did.
[12:10.820 --> 12:12.420]  So he got it from his skin into his eye.
[12:12.420 --> 12:13.940]  Now he's got pH down on his hand.
[12:13.940 --> 12:14.980]  It's burning his hand.
[12:14.980 --> 12:16.420]  Now he's also got it in his eye.
[12:16.420 --> 12:17.620]  He didn't know what to do.
[12:17.620 --> 12:18.580]  You know what he had to do?
[12:18.580 --> 12:24.340]  He pulled out his phone and used Siri to call 911 to call an ambulance to his grow room
[12:24.340 --> 12:25.460]  to come help him out.
[12:25.460 --> 12:26.820]  Imagine being in that situation.
[12:26.820 --> 12:29.940]  You don't want the cops, the paramedics showing up at your grow
[12:29.940 --> 12:31.460]  unless it's completely legal.
[12:31.460 --> 12:32.180]  That could be terrible.
[12:32.360 --> 12:34.440]  So everything I'm talking about has a purpose.
[12:34.440 --> 12:36.360]  I'm not just coming out here trying to be dad.
[12:36.360 --> 12:38.520]  I know I'm getting older, but that's not what this is about.
[12:38.520 --> 12:41.560]  This is because I care about you guys and you may not have thought about this.
[12:41.560 --> 12:45.640]  So I'm trying to give you a reminder and give you examples of why you might want to use
[12:45.640 --> 12:46.840]  the equipment I'm talking about.
[12:47.400 --> 12:49.160]  Gloves, long sleeves, good shoes.
[12:49.160 --> 12:51.000]  That should all be self-explanatory.
[12:51.000 --> 12:52.920]  Goggles, that should be self-explanatory.
[12:52.920 --> 12:54.200]  Like I said, your eyes are sensitive.
[12:54.200 --> 12:57.400]  I can poke you anywhere else on your body, but the minute I touch your eyeball, you fucking
[12:57.400 --> 12:58.600]  want to run away and take a minute.
[12:59.320 --> 12:59.560]  All right.
[12:59.580 --> 13:03.580]  Another thing I want to make sure to talk about is selecting the appropriate mask or
[13:03.580 --> 13:05.980]  respirator when applying a pesticide.
[13:05.980 --> 13:10.060]  A lot of times I see guys wearing gloves and long sleeves and they got the goggles on when
[13:10.060 --> 13:14.540]  they're spraying a pesticide, but they have forgotten to use some sort of a mask or respirator
[13:14.540 --> 13:16.540]  over their face to protect themselves.
[13:16.540 --> 13:19.180]  When you're spraying a pesticide, you're making bubbles.
[13:19.180 --> 13:21.660]  You're making a mist in the room and then you're breathing.
[13:22.460 --> 13:24.700]  You're just sucking up all that mist, all those bubbles.
[13:24.700 --> 13:26.300]  You are pesticiding yourself.
[13:26.320 --> 13:30.800]  You're applying pesticides to your lungs if you're not wearing the appropriate respirator.
[13:30.800 --> 13:37.360]  So I highly recommend the appropriate respirator for pesticide applications, especially if
[13:37.360 --> 13:40.640]  you were using something like a paint sprayer to make really small bubbles.
[13:40.640 --> 13:46.000]  If you're using a fogger, definitely, definitely you need a mask or a respirator.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.720]  On the inside of your pesticides, not on the inside, on the outside of the pesticide bottle,
[13:50.720 --> 13:51.360]  there is a book.
[13:51.360 --> 13:55.760]  If you open that book, it will tell you what personal protective equipment you need to
[13:55.780 --> 13:59.460]  wear while applying that pesticide, where all of that stuff.
[13:59.460 --> 14:02.660]  If it says minimum requirement, that is the minimum requirement.
[14:02.660 --> 14:05.300]  You can do more, but don't do less than that.
[14:05.300 --> 14:09.620]  Also, there is what is known as a re-entry interval printed on that bottle.
[14:10.180 --> 14:16.020]  The REI tells you how long you need to stay out of that grow room without personal protective
[14:16.020 --> 14:19.540]  equipment before you re-enter after applying that pesticide.
[14:19.540 --> 14:24.020]  So if the REI is four hours, you go in there with your equipment, you spray, you come out,
[14:24.040 --> 14:25.640]  you set a timer for four hours.
[14:25.640 --> 14:30.200]  If it's a commercial grow, put a sign on the door that says, hey, I sprayed in here at noon.
[14:30.200 --> 14:31.960]  Don't go back in here until four o'clock.
[14:31.960 --> 14:35.400]  There are signs that are already pre-made from the Department of Agriculture.
[14:35.400 --> 14:36.200]  They will give them to you.
[14:36.200 --> 14:37.320]  They will sell them to you.
[14:37.320 --> 14:40.680]  Put those signs on your doors to let people know, don't go in here.
[14:40.680 --> 14:41.880]  I sprayed this room.
[14:41.880 --> 14:43.080]  You will get sick.
[14:43.080 --> 14:44.920]  Then here's something to think about.
[14:44.920 --> 14:52.120]  If you are applying pesticides indoors, increase the REI by a minimum of two to four hours.
[14:52.620 --> 14:58.380]  The REI, the re-entry interval, was designed for a greenhouse or an outdoor application.
[14:58.380 --> 15:01.900]  They did not think we were going to apply these pesticides indoors.
[15:01.900 --> 15:04.700]  Indoors, we don't have the sun breaking down the pesticides.
[15:04.700 --> 15:05.980]  We don't have as much air movement.
[15:05.980 --> 15:07.180]  We don't have wind.
[15:07.180 --> 15:08.780]  It's not as open and free.
[15:08.780 --> 15:11.500]  You are trapped in that stagnant box of a grow room.
[15:11.500 --> 15:17.980]  So please allow an extra two to four hours for a re-entry interval after a pesticide in a small,
[15:17.980 --> 15:21.580]  in a grow room indoors, not just a small, in a big room indoors.
[15:21.600 --> 15:23.360]  Let that pesticide break down.
[15:23.360 --> 15:25.760]  Let that cloud of fog spray go away.
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.360]  Don't put yourself in danger.
[15:27.360 --> 15:30.160]  Give yourself that extra re-entry interval.
[15:31.040 --> 15:35.280]  Also, write down every pesticide application.
[15:35.280 --> 15:39.600]  If you were in a commercial grow, you are required to keep a pesticide log.
[15:39.600 --> 15:44.160]  If you were in a personal grow, I recommend keeping a pesticide log.
[15:44.160 --> 15:49.360]  Write down every pesticide you sprayed, the date you sprayed it, the amount you put in the mix when
[15:49.380 --> 15:52.020]  you mixed it up, and which plants you sprayed it on.
[15:52.020 --> 15:58.740]  So it'll say like, Tuesday, this is the date I applied these pesticides at this much on these
[15:58.740 --> 16:00.740]  plants at this time.
[16:00.740 --> 16:04.980]  Then we have a good documentation of when you applied things you know when you sprayed last.
[16:04.980 --> 16:07.620]  Right now, if I say, hey, when did you spray for spider mites last?
[16:07.620 --> 16:08.180]  Do you know?
[16:08.740 --> 16:09.860]  Write that shit down.
[16:09.860 --> 16:14.820]  Then you know that within three to five days, it is time to treat again so I don't get an
[16:14.820 --> 16:15.460]  infestation.
[16:15.460 --> 16:19.220]  And if I do have an infestation, I need to stay on top of a tight schedule.
[16:19.720 --> 16:21.720]  Pesticide logs are very important.
[16:21.720 --> 16:26.280]  Also, in the future, if you get some sort of a rash that could be a pesticide outbreak or a
[16:26.280 --> 16:30.920]  pesticide exposure, we know that you sprayed this pesticide on these plants on this date because
[16:30.920 --> 16:32.120]  here it is, you wrote it down.
[16:32.120 --> 16:33.160]  You can help yourself out.
[16:33.160 --> 16:35.240]  You can help the doctor out if you do get sick.
[16:35.240 --> 16:36.280]  Just help yourself out.
[16:36.280 --> 16:37.880]  Set yourself up for success.
[16:38.600 --> 16:40.520]  Pesticide logs are very important.
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.400]  Also, I recommend having, if you're in a commercial grow, this is required, but I recommend having
[16:45.400 --> 16:48.920]  MSDS sheets for almost every product you use.
[16:49.720 --> 16:52.600]  Especially pesticides, especially foliar feeds.
[16:52.600 --> 16:55.240]  Then also have them for all of your nutrients.
[16:55.240 --> 17:00.040]  Anything that comes into that grow, just print off an MSDS sheet, put it in a folder next to
[17:00.040 --> 17:01.160]  your pesticide logs.
[17:01.160 --> 17:04.280]  That way, any information that we need, we've got available.
[17:04.280 --> 17:07.640]  If something does go wrong, we've got all the information we need.
[17:07.640 --> 17:09.240]  I hope nothing goes wrong.
[17:09.240 --> 17:14.440]  But if you get a rash, if you get a weird disease, we can look at all of your MSDS sheets and say,
[17:14.440 --> 17:16.120]  oh, he's using this product and this product.
[17:16.120 --> 17:18.120]  Oh, here's the one right here that's giving him seizures.
[17:18.140 --> 17:19.500]  Maybe we can figure something out.
[17:19.500 --> 17:23.260]  I don't want that to happen to you, but if it does happen, all of that documentation
[17:23.260 --> 17:24.300]  will help us out.
[17:24.300 --> 17:26.620]  Accountability will really help you out in the future.
[17:27.660 --> 17:31.980]  If you are keeping all of these documents in your personal grow, when it comes time to expand
[17:31.980 --> 17:34.780]  into commercial growing, you're already working with the practice.
[17:34.780 --> 17:36.940]  It's already something you're programmed to do.
[17:36.940 --> 17:38.700]  It's not a big, whole new step.
[17:38.700 --> 17:40.300]  It's not a whole bunch of new shit to learn.
[17:41.020 --> 17:44.540]  Pesticide logs and MSDS sheets can be invaluable.
[17:44.540 --> 17:45.900]  Have those around in your grow.
[17:46.400 --> 17:50.720]  Now, I just thought of if you're in an illegal area, if you're in prohibition land, that's like
[17:50.720 --> 17:51.200]  evidence.
[17:51.200 --> 17:52.560]  Maybe you don't want all that shit.
[17:52.560 --> 17:56.960]  Maybe keep that as a Google Doc and maybe have a couple of passwords so nobody can access that.
[17:56.960 --> 18:02.160]  But if you were in a legal area and you were growing, I would have MSDS sheets and pesticide
[18:02.160 --> 18:03.920]  logs just as accountability.
[18:03.920 --> 18:08.160]  And they work well in the future for if you want to do some sort of applying for jobs,
[18:08.160 --> 18:12.800]  you could say, I've already been keeping pesticide logs and MSDS sheets and also understand your
[18:12.800 --> 18:15.040]  local Department of Agriculture rules.
[18:15.060 --> 18:18.100]  So I think that gets us through most of that part.
[18:18.100 --> 18:20.100]  Always read the labels on your pesticides.
[18:20.100 --> 18:21.620]  There's another note that I wrote.
[18:21.620 --> 18:25.700]  That little book on the front of the pesticide pops open and there are so many details in
[18:25.700 --> 18:25.940]  there.
[18:25.940 --> 18:33.540]  A reentry interval, what to look for for exposure, how much to apply, when to apply it, what
[18:33.540 --> 18:39.060]  personal protective equipment to use, if it is toxic, if it's dangerous, if it's got all that
[18:39.060 --> 18:39.940]  is labeled on there.
[18:39.940 --> 18:40.580]  Check that out.
[18:40.580 --> 18:41.700]  I recommend you look at that.
[18:41.720 --> 18:45.000]  The little booklet that pops out, there's a lot of good info in there.
[18:45.000 --> 18:45.960]  Read it if you never have.
[18:45.960 --> 18:47.000]  I highly recommend that.
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.960]  So that covers basically like pesticide safety and pesticide safety, application safety, the
[18:53.960 --> 18:54.760]  basics of growing.
[18:54.760 --> 18:57.640]  Now let's work on grow safety a little bit.
[18:58.280 --> 19:01.800]  When you're in the grow, there are a lot of things you can hurt yourself with.
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.560]  A lot of things I see that drive me crazy are sticks.
[19:05.560 --> 19:06.920]  I do it in my grow too.
[19:06.920 --> 19:10.840]  But those big sticks, if they're not tall enough, if they're too tall, the ones that are like
[19:10.860 --> 19:14.540]  four feet tall, I see a lot of people potentially poking their eyes on those.
[19:14.540 --> 19:16.140]  I've almost done it myself.
[19:16.140 --> 19:19.500]  So you've got a plant, it's starting to droop on one side, you put a couple of sticks in there,
[19:19.500 --> 19:22.380]  you put a zip tie around it, now your plant's staying up, you got a stick on it, everything
[19:22.380 --> 19:23.340]  is cool, right?
[19:23.340 --> 19:26.940]  But tomorrow when you go to water that plant, or maybe you're just going to look at the plant,
[19:26.940 --> 19:30.940]  you lean over, you forget there's a stick in there, that stick goes right in your fucking eye.
[19:30.940 --> 19:32.140]  Those things are dangerous.
[19:32.140 --> 19:36.460]  If you're going to put sticks in the grow room, stakes, bamboo sticks, put something at the end
[19:36.460 --> 19:40.540]  of that, make it a flag or put a tennis ball or a ping pong ball at the end of it to where it's
[19:40.560 --> 19:44.080]  not so pokey and it's not such a eye danger.
[19:44.080 --> 19:46.960]  Those things will poke you right in the eye, that'll fuck you up.
[19:46.960 --> 19:52.000]  Another thing, people seem to forget that scissors are sharp.
[19:52.000 --> 19:55.120]  When you're in the grow room, when you're in the trim room, you're hauling ass,
[19:55.120 --> 19:58.080]  pay attention because those fiskers are fucking sharp.
[19:58.080 --> 19:59.440]  I've seen a lot of people cut themselves.
[19:59.440 --> 20:01.360]  I've seen people cut other people.
[20:01.360 --> 20:02.400]  Pay attention, you guys.
[20:02.400 --> 20:03.120]  Be safe.
[20:03.120 --> 20:06.160]  I shouldn't have to remind you, scissors are sharp.
[20:06.160 --> 20:07.840]  Don't leave them in random places.
[20:07.840 --> 20:09.280]  Don't put them in your pocket.
[20:09.300 --> 20:12.740]  If you're going to carry scissors around, use the little scissor holster that they come with.
[20:12.740 --> 20:14.820]  All the scissors come with a little protective thing.
[20:14.820 --> 20:15.700]  Use that shit.
[20:15.700 --> 20:16.660]  Put it on your belt.
[20:16.660 --> 20:19.780]  If you insist on putting the scissors in your pocket, put them in that little sheath,
[20:19.780 --> 20:20.980]  then put them in your pocket.
[20:20.980 --> 20:22.100]  Be careful, you guys.
[20:22.100 --> 20:25.140]  I don't want to have to write an incident report on you because you were just being dumb.
[20:25.700 --> 20:26.740]  Scissors are sharp.
[20:26.740 --> 20:30.420]  I know, it's dumb that I have to remind you, but some people need that fucking reminder.
[20:30.420 --> 20:33.540]  Also, grow lights are hot as fuck.
[20:33.540 --> 20:34.900]  Those bulbs are hot.
[20:34.900 --> 20:35.700]  Don't touch those.
[20:36.520 --> 20:40.600]  When it comes time to change a grow light, you can't just unscrew it and put a new one in.
[20:40.600 --> 20:44.280]  It needs a little bit to cool off, depending on the size of the bulb and how long it's been running.
[20:44.280 --> 20:46.600]  That thing is probably fucking hot, dude.
[20:46.600 --> 20:47.640]  Don't touch it.
[20:47.640 --> 20:50.200]  Remember, grow lights are hot when they're turned on.
[20:50.200 --> 20:53.960]  Also, blowers and extraction fans will eat your fucking fingers.
[20:53.960 --> 20:56.360]  Don't think that you're just going to move it or adjust it.
[20:56.360 --> 20:59.000]  A blower, something like that, turn it off, unplug it.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.960]  If you have to adjust the ducting, if you're going to move an extraction fan,
[21:01.960 --> 21:04.840]  I've cut my finger really badly on a squirrel cage fan.
[21:04.860 --> 21:05.740]  I'm showing it to the camera.
[21:05.740 --> 21:07.820]  I don't know if you can see that scar on camera.
[21:07.820 --> 21:09.580]  I almost took the tip of that finger off.
[21:09.580 --> 21:11.500]  That is why it is not shaped appropriately.
[21:12.140 --> 21:15.180]  I messed myself up really badly on a blower.
[21:15.180 --> 21:20.460]  I was doing work on a ceiling area of a grow, and the ceiling, one of the supports came in,
[21:20.460 --> 21:23.980]  and the blower kind of turned, and my finger went right into the opening of the blower,
[21:23.980 --> 21:26.460]  and the tip of it is gone somewhere.
[21:26.460 --> 21:27.820]  It's shredded into little pieces.
[21:27.820 --> 21:29.580]  There were 13 stitches in my finger.
[21:29.580 --> 21:31.340]  It hurts right now just thinking about it.
[21:31.340 --> 21:32.300]  Be fucking careful.
[21:32.300 --> 21:33.500]  Those blowers are dangerous.
[21:34.320 --> 21:35.120]  Where else are we?
[21:35.120 --> 21:35.600]  Fans.
[21:36.160 --> 21:41.040]  There are fans everywhere in grow rooms, in personal grows and commercial grows.
[21:41.040 --> 21:43.680]  Those fans can be extremely dangerous.
[21:43.680 --> 21:45.760]  I've got dreadlocks to my knees.
[21:45.760 --> 21:47.840]  If you're in a grow room, tie up your dreadlocks.
[21:47.840 --> 21:50.160]  If you've got a ponytail, stick it in your shirt.
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.400]  Those fans will cause you problems.
[21:52.400 --> 21:58.000]  Also, in a commercial grow environment, we are required to have a badge on us at all times
[21:58.000 --> 21:58.720]  that is visible.
[21:58.720 --> 22:01.840]  It's got to be above the waist and below the neck,
[22:01.860 --> 22:04.820]  and it's got to be visible by the camera so that if anybody looks at the camera,
[22:04.820 --> 22:06.020]  they can say, that guy belongs there.
[22:06.020 --> 22:07.220]  He's got a badge.
[22:07.220 --> 22:10.180]  Many of us wear the badge on a lanyard around our necks.
[22:11.300 --> 22:15.860]  In Colorado, it is required that that lanyard be a breakaway lanyard,
[22:15.860 --> 22:19.060]  which means in the middle of it, it's got a little section that if I pull hard enough,
[22:19.060 --> 22:20.020]  it just breaks.
[22:20.020 --> 22:24.740]  It doesn't have the potential or the opportunity to wrap around my neck and strangle me
[22:24.740 --> 22:27.220]  if it becomes tied in a fan or a blower.
[22:27.220 --> 22:31.220]  So if you're wearing a lanyard in a grow and you have got fans around you,
[22:31.240 --> 22:34.840]  don't get that lanyard caught in something and get yourself fucking hung.
[22:34.840 --> 22:39.800]  Also, if you're working with a trim machine or a trim reaper or something that's in front of you,
[22:39.800 --> 22:42.760]  don't lean over and stick your lanyard into the trim machine.
[22:42.760 --> 22:43.800]  I've seen it done.
[22:43.800 --> 22:46.760]  I've seen the lanyard get stuck in the wood chipper, the trim machine.
[22:46.760 --> 22:48.200]  I've seen it put through everything.
[22:48.760 --> 22:49.960]  Pay attention to your lanyard.
[22:49.960 --> 22:51.080]  I recommend the little armband.
[22:51.080 --> 22:51.880]  They sell an armband.
[22:51.880 --> 22:54.360]  You can put your badge in there, put it on your arm.
[22:54.360 --> 22:55.720]  It's not dangling off of you.
[22:55.720 --> 22:57.320]  It's not going to end up in the nutrients.
[22:57.320 --> 22:59.240]  It's not going to end up in the plants and the trimmer.
[22:59.240 --> 23:01.000]  It's not going to end up getting you in trouble.
[23:01.020 --> 23:02.620]  It's not going to get stuck in a fan.
[23:02.620 --> 23:04.220]  So the fans are dangerous.
[23:04.220 --> 23:08.540]  You guys, if you got dreadlocks, long hair, ponytails, keep that shit tucked away.
[23:08.540 --> 23:10.300]  Don't get them tied up in a fan.
[23:10.300 --> 23:11.820]  I think my dreads would ruin a fan.
[23:11.820 --> 23:14.940]  Honestly, if it grabbed one of these, it probably just inked the fan off the wall.
[23:14.940 --> 23:15.740]  I'm going to win.
[23:15.740 --> 23:17.420]  I don't know what kind of situation you've got.
[23:17.420 --> 23:17.980]  Be careful.
[23:18.540 --> 23:19.500]  I want to keep moving.
[23:20.060 --> 23:21.900]  Um, where are we?
[23:21.900 --> 23:23.260]  How do I fit this one in here?
[23:23.260 --> 23:27.100]  People may not be prepared for this safety, uh, grow room safety.
[23:27.100 --> 23:28.220]  It's going to stink.
[23:28.240 --> 23:31.280]  Part of being safe is not being detected by the police.
[23:31.280 --> 23:34.080]  So legal safety, it's going to stink.
[23:34.080 --> 23:34.960]  Be prepared.
[23:34.960 --> 23:36.400]  Have carbon filtration.
[23:36.400 --> 23:37.440]  Have an excuse.
[23:37.440 --> 23:40.160]  If somebody says it smells like skunks, know what you're going to say.
[23:40.160 --> 23:41.200]  Have a story.
[23:41.200 --> 23:44.480]  Also, what are you going to do if somebody knocks on the door and wants to talk about it?
[23:44.480 --> 23:46.800]  They're not allowed in your home without a warrant.
[23:46.800 --> 23:50.800]  Walk the door, close the door behind you, stand on the front porch and talk to law enforcement
[23:50.800 --> 23:51.520]  outside of your home.
[23:51.520 --> 23:52.720]  And when they say, can we go in?
[23:52.720 --> 23:54.640]  Say, funny story, I'm locked out.
[23:54.640 --> 23:56.240]  And then you leave and they leave too.
[23:56.240 --> 23:57.360]  Nobody goes in your home.
[23:57.380 --> 24:00.020]  Know what you're going to do if you were approached by law enforcement.
[24:00.020 --> 24:02.980]  Have a plan, practice, don't get too nervous.
[24:02.980 --> 24:08.420]  Also, when harvest time comes, it is going to stink more than it does during the grow.
[24:08.420 --> 24:09.780]  Be prepared for that.
[24:09.780 --> 24:11.300]  Harvest is stinky.
[24:11.300 --> 24:16.180]  Also, know where you're going to securely store and save, store and save and dry and
[24:16.180 --> 24:17.060]  cure your harvest.
[24:17.060 --> 24:18.100]  Sorry about the new tongue.
[24:18.100 --> 24:19.220]  I'll get caught up.
[24:19.220 --> 24:21.060]  But it is going to stink a lot.
[24:22.180 --> 24:24.340]  Now let's talk about, uh, personal safety.
[24:24.920 --> 24:29.560]  One of the main ways to keep yourself safe when it comes to growing is to shut the fuck
[24:29.560 --> 24:29.720]  up.
[24:30.280 --> 24:31.880]  Don't tell anybody that doesn't need to know.
[24:32.440 --> 24:34.200]  I know it's a lot of fun talking about growing.
[24:34.200 --> 24:36.280]  I am in a completely legal environment.
[24:36.280 --> 24:37.160]  I grow commercially.
[24:37.160 --> 24:38.120]  It is my job.
[24:38.120 --> 24:39.240]  I pay taxes on it.
[24:39.240 --> 24:40.520]  I get a paycheck for it.
[24:40.520 --> 24:41.320]  That's what I do.
[24:41.320 --> 24:42.360]  I can talk about it.
[24:42.360 --> 24:43.560]  I don't know where you are.
[24:43.560 --> 24:44.840]  I don't know who your friends are.
[24:44.840 --> 24:46.680]  I don't know who your ex-girlfriend is.
[24:46.680 --> 24:49.480]  I don't know who your ex-girlfriend's new boyfriend is.
[24:49.480 --> 24:53.560]  So shut the fuck up about your grow and don't tell people unless it needs to be known.
[24:53.580 --> 24:55.100]  That is personal safety.
[24:55.100 --> 24:57.100]  Keep your grow and yourself safe.
[24:57.100 --> 24:58.300]  Don't tell people.
[24:58.300 --> 24:59.900]  If they don't need to know, they don't need to know.
[24:59.900 --> 25:01.500]  Don't bring people into the grow.
[25:01.500 --> 25:05.180]  Nobody else needs to be there unless they are helping you and you are paying them.
[25:05.180 --> 25:07.820]  Nobody else needs to be in that grow, but you don't show it off.
[25:07.820 --> 25:08.460]  Don't flex.
[25:09.180 --> 25:10.220]  Take some pictures.
[25:10.220 --> 25:15.100]  Once the product is harvested, dried, cured, and either smoked or removed from your area,
[25:15.100 --> 25:18.300]  post some pictures up to social media and get some bragging rights there.
[25:18.300 --> 25:20.940]  But you don't need to bring people in there and show you.
[25:20.940 --> 25:23.340]  And that leads me into internet safety.
[25:23.360 --> 25:26.640]  There are a lot of things to talk about when it comes to internet safety.
[25:26.640 --> 25:29.120]  Not just the safety of the internet.
[25:29.120 --> 25:30.720]  Are you revealing your identity?
[25:30.720 --> 25:32.560]  Are you revealing your location?
[25:32.560 --> 25:35.280]  In your pictures, are you showing that you're allowed six plants,
[25:35.280 --> 25:37.760]  but in your photos you blatantly have 18?
[25:37.760 --> 25:39.520]  Think about that type of internet safety.
[25:39.520 --> 25:43.360]  Then think about even further security codes, passwords.
[25:43.360 --> 25:44.240]  Is anybody hacking you?
[25:44.240 --> 25:45.680]  Is anybody watching you?
[25:45.680 --> 25:46.320]  Is your internet...
[25:47.520 --> 25:48.560]  Let me try that again.
[25:48.560 --> 25:50.400]  Is your internet search history...
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.520]  That was the word I wanted.
[25:51.540 --> 25:56.340]  Is your internet search history going to be a problem if anybody wants to look at that?
[25:56.340 --> 25:58.260]  So think about internet safety.
[25:58.260 --> 25:59.620]  Think about what you're posting.
[25:59.620 --> 26:00.820]  Think about when you post it.
[26:00.820 --> 26:02.260]  Think about what is in your photos.
[26:02.820 --> 26:05.380]  If I went outside to my front yard and took a photo,
[26:06.180 --> 26:08.660]  facing a selfie, facing away from my house,
[26:08.660 --> 26:10.980]  but you caught my neighbor's house in the background,
[26:10.980 --> 26:13.860]  you could probably look at my neighbor's address and drive around.
[26:13.860 --> 26:14.900]  You know what area I live in.
[26:14.900 --> 26:17.460]  You may be able to triangulate my location.
[26:17.460 --> 26:20.980]  So be very careful with what you post on the internet.
[26:21.000 --> 26:24.680]  Also, if you've got kids, be very careful with the kids in the house.
[26:24.680 --> 26:29.640]  If you've got a grow room, make sure it is locked and the kids do not have access to it.
[26:29.640 --> 26:32.280]  Maybe you're one of those people who is growing for a sick child.
[26:32.280 --> 26:35.880]  Maybe you're one of the people who allows a child to help you in the grow.
[26:35.880 --> 26:40.680]  Make sure that that child does not have access to the grow without your supervision.
[26:40.680 --> 26:44.440]  Also, there are many legalities involving children in your grow.
[26:44.440 --> 26:45.400]  So be careful.
[26:45.400 --> 26:47.880]  That takes me back to be careful what you post.
[26:47.900 --> 26:50.140]  If it's not legal for that child to be in your grow,
[26:50.140 --> 26:52.940]  do not post a picture of that child in your grow.
[26:52.940 --> 26:54.300]  Think about what you're posting.
[26:54.300 --> 26:55.100]  Be safe.
[26:55.100 --> 26:56.380]  Keep the kids out of the grow.
[26:56.380 --> 26:57.180]  Keep them safe.
[26:57.180 --> 26:58.620]  Also be honest with the children.
[26:58.620 --> 27:00.060]  I think that's the best way to teach them.
[27:00.060 --> 27:01.500]  If they say, what's going on down there?
[27:01.500 --> 27:02.940]  Say, I'm growing medicine.
[27:02.940 --> 27:06.140]  Otherwise, they think there's fucking aliens down there and they really want to know.
[27:06.140 --> 27:08.060]  But if you tell them what's happening and you're honest,
[27:08.060 --> 27:09.900]  they might let you get away with it.
[27:09.900 --> 27:11.980]  So let's move our way into pets.
[27:12.940 --> 27:16.060]  I don't like seeing cats and dogs in the grow room.
[27:16.080 --> 27:18.080]  I know a lot of people like to take their animals in there.
[27:18.080 --> 27:19.120]  They're inclusive.
[27:19.120 --> 27:22.480]  But I feel that pets are vectors of problems.
[27:22.480 --> 27:26.240]  They carry, they're probably carrying spider mites or some sort of bug that I don't want
[27:26.240 --> 27:28.880]  or a dander or a mold or some shit that I don't want.
[27:28.880 --> 27:30.000]  They're out there running around.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.280]  They're down there low by the ground.
[27:31.280 --> 27:32.240]  They play in the bushes.
[27:32.240 --> 27:33.200]  They do all that shit.
[27:33.200 --> 27:34.480]  I don't want that in my grow.
[27:34.480 --> 27:35.760]  I keep the pets out of the grow.
[27:35.760 --> 27:36.960]  That is me personally.
[27:36.960 --> 27:38.240]  That's my recommendation.
[27:38.240 --> 27:39.440]  You do what makes you happy.
[27:39.440 --> 27:42.880]  But just know that is a potential carrier for problems.
[27:42.900 --> 27:47.460]  Also, keep your pets safe if they do come in the grow.
[27:47.460 --> 27:49.540]  Like I said earlier, we're applying pesticides.
[27:49.540 --> 27:50.660]  We're using nutrients.
[27:51.220 --> 27:55.700]  Dogs and cats, especially dogs, just like to eat random shit and lick at anything.
[27:56.340 --> 28:00.660]  Some of those nutrients and pesticides could be very problematic for a little dog,
[28:00.660 --> 28:01.940]  even for a big dog.
[28:01.940 --> 28:04.740]  If a dog ate a bottle of nutrients, they would get sick.
[28:04.740 --> 28:08.020]  If a dog ate a bottle of pesticides, it would get sick.
[28:08.020 --> 28:09.620]  Keep that in mind for your pets.
[28:09.620 --> 28:12.660]  Let's love our pets the best we can and keep them safe as well.
[28:13.160 --> 28:14.200]  Grow room safety.
[28:14.200 --> 28:17.240]  Keep the pets and the kids out of there and keep them safe.
[28:17.240 --> 28:20.520]  Now, another thing I want to talk about is environmental impact.
[28:21.320 --> 28:23.400]  Not only do we need to think about being safe,
[28:23.400 --> 28:26.920]  we need to think about what we're doing to the earth, to the world.
[28:26.920 --> 28:28.360]  Are you causing a problem?
[28:28.360 --> 28:30.280]  Are you going to do something that's irreversible?
[28:31.000 --> 28:32.120]  The earth is not yours.
[28:32.120 --> 28:34.920]  That little square patch that you own, that's yours.
[28:34.920 --> 28:37.080]  But the rest of it is everybody else's.
[28:37.080 --> 28:38.120]  And you only own the ground.
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.320]  You don't own all the air and all the bugs that tried to fly in and out of there.
[28:41.340 --> 28:44.700]  You don't own the life that evolves around that earth, around that patch of land.
[28:44.700 --> 28:49.020]  So be mindful of your environmental impact on your growth.
[28:49.020 --> 28:51.820]  If you're growing indoors or outdoors, there are things to think about.
[28:52.380 --> 28:55.740]  As a bottled nutrient user, I get a lot of bottles.
[28:55.740 --> 29:00.700]  I try to find places to recycle, but they don't want to recycle nutrient bottles in many locations.
[29:00.700 --> 29:02.220]  So think about that sort of stuff.
[29:02.220 --> 29:03.500]  We need to get away from bottles.
[29:03.500 --> 29:04.860]  Buy bigger bottles if you can.
[29:04.860 --> 29:06.220]  Don't buy a bunch of quarts.
[29:06.220 --> 29:08.380]  Buy the big five gallon if you can do that.
[29:08.400 --> 29:13.360]  Think about ways to decrease your carbon footprint.
[29:13.360 --> 29:14.240]  Something to think about.
[29:15.360 --> 29:16.160]  I'm talking about trash.
[29:16.160 --> 29:17.520]  We throw a lot of shit away.
[29:17.520 --> 29:23.520]  When you throw out your trash, is it possible that anybody can discover you're a grower through your trash?
[29:23.520 --> 29:26.080]  Looking in the trash, do they find nutrient bottles?
[29:26.080 --> 29:27.600]  Are they finding pesticide bottles?
[29:27.600 --> 29:29.200]  Are they finding old scrap leaf?
[29:29.200 --> 29:30.880]  Are they finding old stems?
[29:30.880 --> 29:32.080]  Be careful with your trash.
[29:32.080 --> 29:34.960]  Once that goes out onto the curb, that is public property.
[29:34.960 --> 29:36.160]  The cops can go through it.
[29:36.160 --> 29:37.440]  Your neighbors can go through it.
[29:37.460 --> 29:39.220]  The hobos are probably going to go through it.
[29:40.100 --> 29:41.220]  Think about what they're going to find.
[29:41.940 --> 29:44.180]  Do you need to get rid of your trash more carefully?
[29:44.180 --> 29:44.980]  I want to keep moving.
[29:44.980 --> 29:49.700]  I've got a really long list of stuff I want to cover, and I feel like I'm already quite a ways into this podcast.
[29:50.260 --> 29:53.540]  So always grow with the appropriate equipment.
[29:53.540 --> 29:56.180]  I see a lot of people building makeshift grows.
[29:56.180 --> 30:00.340]  I understand you don't have an unlimited budget, and you've got to work with what you've got,
[30:00.340 --> 30:02.900]  but some of that shit gets dangerous.
[30:02.900 --> 30:07.300]  The most dangerous things I see is inappropriate electric.
[30:07.320 --> 30:09.960]  Run your electricity appropriately.
[30:09.960 --> 30:12.440]  Use the proper electric fixtures.
[30:12.440 --> 30:14.440]  I see people just doing random crazy shit.
[30:14.440 --> 30:20.440]  They have people who are nowhere near certified electricians going in and just running wires and doing weird shit.
[30:20.440 --> 30:21.800]  That is a potential hazard.
[30:21.800 --> 30:23.560]  That could burn down your house.
[30:23.560 --> 30:26.280]  If you're sharing a building, that can burn down that building.
[30:26.280 --> 30:33.400]  Please don't be that person who ruined the neighborhood because you had some one of your friends just run some wires so we could run more lights.
[30:33.400 --> 30:34.120]  Don't do that.
[30:34.140 --> 30:40.540]  If you're going to have electrical upgrades, make sure it is done by a, what are they, a certified registered master electrician.
[30:40.540 --> 30:44.380]  I don't know the real word, a real electrician, somebody who's licensed and bonded.
[30:44.380 --> 30:48.460]  Somebody that if they cause a problem, you can call them and say it's your fault and you fucked this up.
[30:48.460 --> 30:52.700]  You're supposed to have a license, not just one of your bros that goes, I think it's this wire and this wire.
[30:52.700 --> 30:53.900]  Have it done professionally.
[30:54.780 --> 30:56.620]  Proper electric is very important.
[30:56.620 --> 30:57.740]  We're running a lot of power.
[30:57.740 --> 30:59.020]  We can cause a lot of problems.
[30:59.600 --> 31:04.800]  To go with that, I say always have a smoke alarm, a smoke detector in the grow room.
[31:04.800 --> 31:06.320]  I highly recommend that.
[31:06.320 --> 31:10.480]  Also, think about what you're going to do if that goes off because that will bring attention.
[31:10.480 --> 31:16.480]  So you need to have a fire extinguisher, either the handheld type that is big enough for your space.
[31:16.480 --> 31:19.600]  If you've got like five or six lights, you need a bigger fire extinguisher.
[31:19.600 --> 31:23.280]  If you've only got one light, you may be okay with the smaller fire extinguisher.
[31:23.300 --> 31:28.900]  Think about the potential problem you're going to have to deal with and have the equipment prepared to combat that issue.
[31:29.540 --> 31:33.940]  They do make a fire extinguisher that hangs from the ceiling in a grow room.
[31:33.940 --> 31:40.020]  And if it reaches a certain temperature, it basically ruptures and it drops a fire retardant dust all over the grow.
[31:40.020 --> 31:44.740]  It will destroy your garden, but it will put out the fire and rescue the rest of your house.
[31:44.740 --> 31:47.060]  So if that is an option, I highly recommend that.
[31:47.060 --> 31:50.500]  If you've got higher ceilings, if you've got enough space and you can afford it.
[31:50.520 --> 31:54.040]  I like the fire extinguisher that hangs from the ceiling.
[31:54.040 --> 31:55.240]  It's a big red ball.
[31:55.240 --> 31:57.480]  And if it gets too hot, it simply explodes.
[31:57.480 --> 31:58.120]  Boom!
[31:58.120 --> 32:04.120]  And then this white powdery dust comes out and it falls all over the room and it basically extinguishes the fire that way.
[32:04.120 --> 32:09.400]  So a fire extinguisher is something I highly recommend to go with your smoke detector.
[32:09.400 --> 32:13.000]  You want to catch that smoke, blast out the fire, and then not have any problems.
[32:13.000 --> 32:16.280]  Keep the fire extinguisher on the outside of the grow room door.
[32:16.300 --> 32:21.420]  If you do hear that smoke alarm going off, you're gonna touch the door, see how hot it is.
[32:21.420 --> 32:23.580]  If it's really hot, you may just want to fucking run.
[32:23.580 --> 32:30.700]  If it's kind of warm, push that door open, back up, assess the situation, have that fire extinguisher in your hand, get going, start spraying.
[32:30.700 --> 32:32.300]  If it's too bad, get the fuck out of there.
[32:32.300 --> 32:34.700]  You guys just run to get the good shit that you can.
[32:34.700 --> 32:36.860]  Get the kids, get the dog, and get the fuck out of there.
[32:36.860 --> 32:39.580]  But try to extinguish it, aim at the base.
[32:39.580 --> 32:42.060]  Also understand how to use your fire extinguisher.
[32:42.060 --> 32:43.660]  Make sure that it's fully charged.
[32:43.680 --> 32:46.400]  Understand you pull the pin, you do this, you point here.
[32:46.400 --> 32:47.520]  Maybe practice.
[32:47.520 --> 32:51.040]  Maybe if you're intimidated by the fire extinguisher, if you think it's gonna be scary,
[32:51.040 --> 32:54.080]  just grab the fire extinguisher and take it out to the yard and just give it a little spray.
[32:54.080 --> 32:55.680]  See what kind of pressure comes out of it.
[32:55.680 --> 32:57.440]  See how it jerks, see how it jumps around.
[32:57.440 --> 32:58.320]  Be prepared.
[32:58.320 --> 33:01.840]  I know at a lot of places, if you go work at a new warehouse or a new facility,
[33:01.840 --> 33:04.880]  they will actually train you in how to use the fire extinguisher,
[33:04.880 --> 33:07.600]  so that if you do need it, you're not in full fucking panic mode.
[33:07.600 --> 33:08.880]  It's something you've done before.
[33:08.880 --> 33:11.840]  So have a smoke alarm and have a fire extinguisher.
[33:11.860 --> 33:14.260]  Something I've already mentioned is a door lock.
[33:14.260 --> 33:15.380]  Lock everything.
[33:15.380 --> 33:16.740]  Lock everything twice.
[33:17.380 --> 33:20.100]  Maybe lock everything a third time, just for safety.
[33:20.100 --> 33:23.460]  We don't need anybody not invited getting into our grows.
[33:23.460 --> 33:25.860]  Also, that comes back around to shut the fuck up.
[33:25.860 --> 33:26.820]  Don't tell anybody.
[33:26.820 --> 33:30.340]  If they don't know it's there, they don't know it's there.
[33:30.340 --> 33:32.180]  Now, we've got everything locked.
[33:32.180 --> 33:33.540]  We've got everything safe.
[33:33.540 --> 33:36.020]  The next step, I think, is cameras.
[33:36.020 --> 33:40.740]  If you can put up cameras near your grow without being obvious that you're watching your grow,
[33:40.760 --> 33:44.920]  that is a great thing to do because now you know when intruders are coming,
[33:44.920 --> 33:47.720]  and you can also check on the plants while you're away.
[33:47.720 --> 33:49.160]  You can just open up your phone and go,
[33:49.160 --> 33:50.520]  oh, that room looks good.
[33:50.520 --> 33:51.960]  None of the plants look super droopy.
[33:51.960 --> 33:52.760]  The plants look happy.
[33:52.760 --> 33:54.040]  The reservoirs are full.
[33:54.040 --> 33:55.720]  I can see most of the things I need to see.
[33:55.720 --> 33:58.040]  I set up my cameras where I can see what I need to see,
[33:58.040 --> 34:01.320]  and we've got a little bit of reassurance and security at the same time.
[34:02.440 --> 34:06.440]  Another thing I really like in the grow for safety and for many other reasons
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.200]  is something like a PL grow minder unit or something similar.
[34:10.220 --> 34:13.740]  This will tell me if the room gets too hot or too cold while I'm away.
[34:14.780 --> 34:17.180]  If I reach a certain condition in my grow room,
[34:17.180 --> 34:18.540]  my phone will beep and tell me,
[34:18.540 --> 34:19.980]  hey, you need to check this out.
[34:19.980 --> 34:21.580]  I open up the app on my phone.
[34:21.580 --> 34:24.540]  I look at the PL grow minder information.
[34:24.540 --> 34:26.700]  It'll say, hey, it's 90 degrees in here.
[34:26.700 --> 34:28.620]  I'll go, I need to solve that problem.
[34:28.620 --> 34:30.860]  Then I open up the camera, look at the camera and go,
[34:30.860 --> 34:32.780]  oh, the plants definitely look hot,
[34:32.780 --> 34:34.700]  and I can see that that fan over there isn't running,
[34:34.700 --> 34:35.980]  or I can see that that air conditioner,
[34:35.980 --> 34:38.140]  you can't see the air conditioner cut off, but you get my point.
[34:38.140 --> 34:39.580]  I can open up the minder unit,
[34:39.600 --> 34:42.000]  then I can look on camera, try to identify the problem.
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.640]  If I need to get to the grow, I can get over there and fix it.
[34:44.640 --> 34:48.800]  So cameras and a PL minder unit together are invaluable.
[34:48.800 --> 34:51.680]  You can see what's going on, and then you get a warning on your phone
[34:51.680 --> 34:54.320]  if anything is out of the parameters, which you expect it to be.
[34:54.960 --> 34:58.800]  Another thing I like is a high heat shutdown.
[34:58.800 --> 35:00.400]  I've got a device on my grow lights.
[35:01.200 --> 35:04.000]  So all of my grow lights plug into one unit,
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.080]  then that unit plugs into the 240, the dryer looking plug.
[35:08.100 --> 35:12.100]  Before that dryer plug, I have got a high heat shutdown.
[35:12.100 --> 35:16.500]  It plugs into the dryer plug, then my light box plugs into that,
[35:16.500 --> 35:19.860]  and that has a wire that goes up to the very center of the room.
[35:19.860 --> 35:23.860]  If that room reaches 110 degrees, everything turns off.
[35:23.860 --> 35:26.100]  It just cuts the power to that whole box.
[35:26.100 --> 35:28.980]  All of my lights turn off. It's not going to heat up anymore.
[35:28.980 --> 35:32.180]  That will save me from roasting the entire room, and it's adjustable.
[35:32.180 --> 35:34.660]  I can change it from 90 to 110 is the range.
[35:34.660 --> 35:36.660]  I think I just left it at 110 when I bought it.
[35:36.680 --> 35:40.040]  So I've got a high heat shutdown to where if the room gets too hot,
[35:40.040 --> 35:41.640]  the lights just shut right off.
[35:41.640 --> 35:45.080]  I did not plug the air conditioner into that same receptacle,
[35:45.080 --> 35:48.440]  so the air conditioner will continue to run if it was running.
[35:48.440 --> 35:50.600]  I'm assuming that since it's 110 degrees in there,
[35:50.600 --> 35:52.120]  that air conditioner fucked up.
[35:52.120 --> 35:53.240]  I need to go check it out.
[35:53.240 --> 35:55.400]  My PL Grow Minder unit sent me a message.
[35:55.400 --> 35:57.880]  I got to open it up and look and say, it's 100 degrees in there.
[35:57.880 --> 35:59.160]  I need to go figure this out.
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.680]  But that high heat shutdown will shut it down while I'm in the car
[36:02.680 --> 36:04.920]  running to the grow trying to get there before the plants melt.
[36:05.900 --> 36:07.420]  I mentioned this before.
[36:07.420 --> 36:10.140]  Another thing we need is plenty of carbon filters.
[36:10.140 --> 36:13.100]  We need to control the aroma and odors of our grows.
[36:13.100 --> 36:17.420]  If you're in a non-legal state, that aroma will be enough to get you in trouble.
[36:17.420 --> 36:19.820]  Have enough carbon filtration.
[36:19.820 --> 36:21.660]  Have a carbon filter in the grow.
[36:21.660 --> 36:24.300]  If you're extracting air, make sure that that air is filtered.
[36:24.300 --> 36:27.180]  Something you can do is just set up a carbon filter and a blower
[36:27.180 --> 36:29.100]  and just have it blow in the room.
[36:29.100 --> 36:31.420]  You're just filtering the air, taking out the aroma.
[36:31.440 --> 36:35.040]  It's also sucking up any dust, anything that might be floating around,
[36:35.040 --> 36:37.840]  just keeping the air clean while sucking out some aroma,
[36:37.840 --> 36:39.280]  keeping you a little bit safe.
[36:39.280 --> 36:43.600]  Also, right by the front door in any entrances and exits of your house,
[36:43.600 --> 36:45.280]  maybe have a little air freshener.
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.080]  I like to keep the cans of, I can't think of what it's called,
[36:48.080 --> 36:49.360]  it's a can of ozone.
[36:49.360 --> 36:50.400]  I can't think of what it's called right now.
[36:50.400 --> 36:52.000]  Ona gel, that is what it's called.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.280]  I keep the jars of Ona gel near the doors.
[36:55.280 --> 36:56.800]  It's just a jar with a lid.
[36:56.800 --> 36:58.080]  You can unscrew the lid.
[36:58.080 --> 36:59.040]  I don't unscrew the lid.
[36:59.060 --> 37:01.940]  I honestly get a drill and I drill six or eight holes in the top of the lid.
[37:01.940 --> 37:02.900]  It keeps my Ona gel.
[37:03.460 --> 37:04.740]  The gel has to stay moist.
[37:04.740 --> 37:07.460]  Once it dries, it stops making air or aroma.
[37:07.460 --> 37:08.980]  So just drill holes in there.
[37:08.980 --> 37:10.340]  Keep the Ona gel jar.
[37:10.340 --> 37:13.060]  I just put it behind a picture right by the door so that when you come in the house,
[37:13.060 --> 37:15.220]  you look at the picture of my daughter, you go, your daughter is beautiful.
[37:15.220 --> 37:17.940]  You don't even know there's a fucking Ona jar hidden behind there.
[37:17.940 --> 37:19.540]  You smell it, you go, it smells great in your house.
[37:19.540 --> 37:22.020]  And I'm like, ah, you see my kid, you smell my aroma,
[37:22.020 --> 37:23.140]  you think I'm a good person.
[37:23.140 --> 37:25.140]  You don't even know there's a bunch of fucking plants in the house.
[37:25.140 --> 37:26.020]  It works really well.
[37:26.040 --> 37:30.760]  So cover your aroma, Ona gels, maybe some ozium spray.
[37:30.760 --> 37:33.480]  Don't use the thing that sprays every fucking 20 minutes.
[37:33.480 --> 37:35.080]  That's obvious that you're hiding something.
[37:35.800 --> 37:38.360]  But carbon filters, Ona gels, those will help you out.
[37:39.240 --> 37:42.040]  Another thing I see people make mistakes is timers.
[37:42.040 --> 37:45.640]  They cannot handle the load which we are assigning to these timers.
[37:45.640 --> 37:49.320]  We plug the timer into the wall, then we plug a thousand watt light into that timer.
[37:49.320 --> 37:51.960]  Sometimes we plug 2000 watt lights into that timer.
[37:51.960 --> 37:55.560]  And we expect that timer to turn off and on every day as it's supposed to do.
[37:55.580 --> 37:59.180]  But what we didn't think about is we're running 2000 watt lights
[37:59.180 --> 38:01.740]  on this one shitty timer and it's going to melt.
[38:01.740 --> 38:03.500]  It may not have the capacity.
[38:03.500 --> 38:06.940]  So make sure that the timers you buy are strong enough to run
[38:06.940 --> 38:09.420]  the amount of electricity you are pushing through them.
[38:09.420 --> 38:11.020]  Electricity can be very dangerous.
[38:11.020 --> 38:13.180]  I've talked about this recently in this episode.
[38:13.180 --> 38:15.340]  Let's not be the person burning down the house
[38:15.340 --> 38:18.300]  by drawing too much electricity through one receptacle.
[38:18.300 --> 38:21.660]  If you feel like your equipment, if the plug-in at the wall is getting hot,
[38:21.660 --> 38:24.780]  if your timer is getting hot, if your extension cord is getting hot,
[38:24.800 --> 38:26.880]  it's not thick enough, strong enough.
[38:26.880 --> 38:30.880]  You need a bigger, more powerful, heavier duty timer and extension cord.
[38:30.880 --> 38:32.160]  I don't like extension cords.
[38:32.160 --> 38:33.600]  That's going to be the next one.
[38:33.600 --> 38:35.520]  No shitty extension cords.
[38:35.520 --> 38:39.600]  It's got to be the big, thick, insulated extension cord or get the fuck out.
[38:39.600 --> 38:42.560]  If you bring in that little, the one that you're going to use to plug in the printer
[38:42.560 --> 38:45.600]  or the extension cord for your phone, don't put that in my grow.
[38:45.600 --> 38:47.120]  No, not qualified.
[38:47.120 --> 38:50.480]  All of the extension cords have to be quality extension cords,
[38:50.480 --> 38:51.840]  the good thick kind.
[38:51.860 --> 38:54.260]  And always, like we talked about earlier,
[38:54.260 --> 38:56.420]  keep your electricity up off the ground.
[38:56.420 --> 38:58.100]  Don't have a bunch of cords on the ground.
[38:58.100 --> 39:00.500]  Don't have a bunch of extension cords down on the floor.
[39:00.500 --> 39:03.380]  Keep your electricity up high to where if there is water on the floor,
[39:03.380 --> 39:06.020]  you don't have any interaction between the electric and the water.
[39:06.020 --> 39:07.780]  The water is going to go straight to the floor.
[39:07.780 --> 39:12.020]  Keep that electricity up high, three feet off the ground or higher is ideal.
[39:12.020 --> 39:17.060]  So no shitty extension cords and be very careful with your cords, your cables.
[39:17.060 --> 39:19.060]  Think about, be mindful, don't trip over them.
[39:19.060 --> 39:19.940]  Don't get them wet.
[39:19.960 --> 39:22.120]  Don't have them in places where they're going to cause problems.
[39:22.120 --> 39:23.720]  Set yourself up for success.
[39:24.360 --> 39:29.000]  Another thing you really need to think about and have prepared in a grow is a first aid kit.
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.880]  I don't want you to have to use it, but I hope that it is there.
[39:31.880 --> 39:35.000]  I talked earlier about a friend getting pH down on his eye,
[39:35.000 --> 39:38.520]  wiped or on his finger, wiped his eye, pH down in his eye.
[39:38.520 --> 39:40.120]  Now he's got to call 911.
[39:40.120 --> 39:41.640]  That is a terrible situation.
[39:41.640 --> 39:45.720]  He had to walk up the grow and scramble up to the top of the stairs and get outside of his house
[39:45.720 --> 39:48.360]  before anybody showed up so he didn't get himself in trouble.
[39:48.380 --> 39:50.780]  Have a first aid kit on hand is what I'm getting at.
[39:50.780 --> 39:55.500]  If something does go wrong, you would much rather have a first aid kit to take care of yourself
[39:55.500 --> 39:58.700]  than have to scramble around and find all the shit to handle yourself.
[39:58.700 --> 40:00.940]  If you cut yourself, you're going to need some gauze.
[40:00.940 --> 40:02.060]  You may need some band-aids.
[40:02.060 --> 40:04.380]  You may need some peroxide to clean yourself out.
[40:04.380 --> 40:06.380]  Maybe a couple of butterfly band-aids.
[40:06.380 --> 40:07.580]  Think about that sort of stuff.
[40:07.580 --> 40:09.020]  Maybe a little bit of burn cream.
[40:09.820 --> 40:12.060]  Maybe you're just a clumsy person.
[40:12.060 --> 40:13.580]  Maybe you were always hurting yourself.
[40:14.220 --> 40:15.580]  Know what you do to yourself.
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.040]  We know as guys, I know that I like to cut my fingers a lot doing dumb shit,
[40:19.040 --> 40:20.400]  trying to pry something open.
[40:20.400 --> 40:22.880]  These regions of our hands, they get cut up a lot.
[40:22.880 --> 40:23.920]  Be prepared for that shit.
[40:23.920 --> 40:25.120]  Have some band-aids.
[40:25.120 --> 40:26.480]  Have something to clean that.
[40:26.480 --> 40:28.000]  Have some of those butterflies around.
[40:28.560 --> 40:30.320]  Multiple sizes of band-aids.
[40:30.320 --> 40:31.760]  Also, eye wash.
[40:32.560 --> 40:34.240]  Many people overlook eye wash.
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.760]  You can buy a bottle of eye wash from Uline is the place where we get them.
[40:39.760 --> 40:41.200]  Get the bottles of eye wash.
[40:41.200 --> 40:44.160]  And if you do get a pesticide in your eye, if you get something in your eyes,
[40:44.180 --> 40:45.140]  grab that bottle.
[40:45.140 --> 40:46.260]  It's got a little spout on it.
[40:46.260 --> 40:49.380]  All you got to do is take off the cap and squeeze it right into your eyes.
[40:49.380 --> 40:52.100]  It will rinse your eyes out, help you out quite a bit.
[40:52.100 --> 40:53.300]  Then you can get more help.
[40:53.300 --> 40:55.220]  But have that eye wash around.
[40:55.220 --> 40:59.220]  In a commercial environment, we're required to have an eye wash within,
[40:59.220 --> 41:00.740]  I don't remember the exact amount of feet right now.
[41:00.740 --> 41:01.380]  I shouldn't admit that.
[41:01.380 --> 41:02.580]  I have to read the rules again.
[41:02.580 --> 41:06.420]  But most of the time, if you're applying a pesticide, you need eye wash within reach.
[41:06.420 --> 41:09.940]  So we tell the guys to carry a bottle of water or the little eye wash bottle
[41:09.940 --> 41:12.260]  on their person while applying a pesticide.
[41:12.280 --> 41:15.400]  So that if you fuck up, if the fan blows the pesticide into your eyes,
[41:15.400 --> 41:17.720]  you can just reach into your pocket, rinse your eyes off right there.
[41:17.720 --> 41:20.840]  You don't have to go too far because you are blinded with shit in your eye.
[41:20.840 --> 41:23.240]  You may not be able to find your way out of the grow room.
[41:23.240 --> 41:25.800]  So have eye wash available.
[41:25.800 --> 41:29.240]  Also, I talked about my friend who had to use Siri.
[41:29.240 --> 41:31.080]  I'm making sure Siri doesn't fire up again.
[41:31.080 --> 41:32.600]  It did turn her off.
[41:32.600 --> 41:37.080]  I have a friend who had to use Siri to call 911 to get himself medical help when he got
[41:37.080 --> 41:38.520]  pH down in his eye.
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.040]  Here is a better option.
[41:40.060 --> 41:43.100]  Have an emergency contact plan.
[41:43.100 --> 41:45.580]  Who are you going to call if something goes wrong in your grow?
[41:45.580 --> 41:46.860]  I know who I'm going to call.
[41:46.860 --> 41:51.100]  So I put that person in my phone and I've got their name in my phone to where all I
[41:51.100 --> 41:55.100]  have to do is say, hey, call this person and Siri will dial that person's number.
[41:55.100 --> 41:56.300]  I don't have to use my fingers.
[41:56.300 --> 41:57.500]  I don't have to use my sight.
[41:57.500 --> 42:01.020]  I can do it just with my voice if I unlock my phone with my thumb.
[42:01.020 --> 42:04.140]  So have some sort of a plan if shit does go wrong.
[42:04.140 --> 42:05.100]  Who are you going to call?
[42:05.100 --> 42:07.660]  The Ghostbusters aren't going to be there to help you with your grow.
[42:07.660 --> 42:09.660]  Have an emergency contact in mind.
[42:09.680 --> 42:13.040]  Have their phone number planned in your phone, programmed into your phone.
[42:13.040 --> 42:15.280]  Also, what's your excuse?
[42:15.280 --> 42:18.160]  If you got to go to the doctor, if you got to go to the hospital because you cut yourself
[42:18.160 --> 42:22.240]  in the grow room or because you got something in your eye, what is your excuse?
[42:22.240 --> 42:25.680]  A lot of us can't go to the hospital and say, I was growing weed and I cut myself.
[42:25.680 --> 42:26.400]  They're going to go, sweet.
[42:26.400 --> 42:29.440]  We're sending the fucking cops to your house right now and we're going to keep you here
[42:29.440 --> 42:30.080]  while they're over there.
[42:30.080 --> 42:32.080]  And then as soon as you get done, we're going to arrest you.
[42:32.080 --> 42:32.880]  Have a plan.
[42:32.880 --> 42:33.760]  Have an alibi.
[42:33.760 --> 42:34.640]  Have an excuse.
[42:34.640 --> 42:35.600]  Know what you're going to say.
[42:36.580 --> 42:40.580]  Then here's the worst part that you can think of, but it's the last thing on my list.
[42:41.540 --> 42:44.900]  How about some bail money and a lawyer on retainer?
[42:44.900 --> 42:48.180]  If you were getting into the grow game and you've got a couple of harvests under your
[42:48.180 --> 42:51.060]  belt and you're starting to make a name for yourself and this is something you're going
[42:51.060 --> 42:54.340]  to do, you need a lawyer and you need bail money.
[42:54.340 --> 42:56.980]  Have that bail money at your lawyer's office.
[42:56.980 --> 43:00.980]  So where anything goes wrong, you call your lawyer and he goes, don't worry, I got you.
[43:00.980 --> 43:02.100]  He's already on retainer.
[43:02.100 --> 43:03.300]  You've paid him a little bit of money.
[43:03.320 --> 43:05.880]  You pay him every couple of months just to keep him on your side.
[43:05.880 --> 43:07.400]  He's got that money in his safe.
[43:07.400 --> 43:10.920]  Then when shit goes wrong, he just drives right over, pays your bail money, gets you
[43:10.920 --> 43:11.400]  moving.
[43:11.400 --> 43:12.520]  It's not a long process.
[43:12.520 --> 43:15.320]  Have that bail money and that lawyer on retainer.
[43:15.320 --> 43:20.440]  Then have your lawyer's phone number in your phone and also try to memorize it because
[43:20.440 --> 43:24.120]  when you're handcuffed and you're being booked, you don't get your phone to go through all
[43:24.120 --> 43:25.000]  those phone numbers.
[43:25.000 --> 43:26.440]  You're going to need to know his number.
[43:26.440 --> 43:31.080]  So remember your emergency contacts phone number and remember your lawyer's phone number.
[43:31.100 --> 43:35.020]  Have that lawyer on retainer and have some bail money set aside.
[43:35.020 --> 43:36.780]  I don't want you to have to use the lawyer.
[43:36.780 --> 43:38.780]  I don't want you to have to use the fire extinguisher.
[43:38.780 --> 43:42.460]  I don't want you to have to use the first aid kit, but if we need them, I want them
[43:42.460 --> 43:43.340]  to be there.
[43:43.340 --> 43:47.180]  It's always better to have the shit you need on hand and be prepared and set yourself up
[43:47.180 --> 43:51.580]  for success than it is to try to figure shit out while you're panicking and under stress.
[43:52.300 --> 43:55.340]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[43:55.340 --> 43:57.900]  smokers and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers.
[43:57.900 --> 44:00.620]  I hope you found some useful information in this episode.

[44:04.720 --> 44:06.880]  and healthy as possible while doing so.
[44:06.880 --> 44:10.800]  So please take care of yourself, pay attention and be mindful in your grow.
[44:10.800 --> 44:13.680]  Keep yourself and your grow partners safe and healthy.
