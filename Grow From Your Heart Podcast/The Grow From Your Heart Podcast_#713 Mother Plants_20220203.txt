[00:02.490 --> 00:25.520]  All right, here we go.
[00:25.520 --> 00:27.080]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:27.080 --> 00:29.820]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.820 --> 00:35.040]  This is episode 713 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:35.040 --> 00:37.880]  In this episode, we're going to talk about mother plants.
[00:37.880 --> 00:41.420]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:41.420 --> 00:46.340]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:46.340 --> 00:48.900]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[01:17.980 --> 01:18.980]  Thank you.
[01:18.980 --> 01:22.240]  Shout out to Green Vet 88224.

[01:44.860 --> 01:48.940]  it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:48.940 --> 01:52.840]  I do want to take an extra second to send a special thank you to everybody who supports
[01:52.840 --> 01:58.300]  the Patreon, especially the past two months, because the past two months have been record
[01:58.300 --> 01:59.300]  setters.
[01:59.300 --> 02:04.340]  We've got a record number of patrons and a record number of patronage of funding coming
[02:04.340 --> 02:05.340]  in.
[02:05.340 --> 02:06.340]  I do appreciate that.
[02:06.340 --> 02:07.620]  It does not go unnoticed.
[02:07.620 --> 02:12.820]  So big thank you to each and every one of you who continue to support the Patreon, especially
[02:12.820 --> 02:14.020]  the past two months.
[02:14.020 --> 02:15.580]  I do appreciate it.
[02:15.580 --> 02:19.700]  To show you a little special thank you, in the month of February, this episode should
[02:19.700 --> 02:23.100]  come out February 1st if I timed things correctly.
[02:23.100 --> 02:27.940]  In the month of February, I will offer a special discount code for the merch store for the
[02:27.940 --> 02:31.860]  patrons at the $7.10 a month level or higher.
[02:31.860 --> 02:35.220]  So if you're contributing 7, 10 or higher, you'll get a discount code.
[02:35.300 --> 02:39.180]  I will try to do the higher levels you're contributing, the higher discount code you
[02:39.180 --> 02:40.300]  will receive.
[02:40.300 --> 02:42.980]  So check for that discount code on Patreon.
[02:42.980 --> 02:48.260]  That will be for the merch store where you can get the t-shirts, the stickers, the grinders,
[02:48.260 --> 02:53.660]  the rolling trays, and of course, the sweet new Grow From Your Heart podcast hemp hats.
[02:53.660 --> 02:55.620]  I don't think I've talked about these on the show.
[02:55.620 --> 02:57.180]  Quickly, let me ramble about these.
[02:57.180 --> 03:01.140]  This piece inside here, this is just a protective piece so that when I ship it to you, it doesn't
[03:01.140 --> 03:02.140]  get crushed and destroyed.
[03:02.140 --> 03:03.740]  It keeps the hat supported.
[03:03.740 --> 03:06.980]  What we've got here is the Grow From Your Heart podcast original logo.
[03:06.980 --> 03:08.540]  I call it the EQ logo.
[03:08.540 --> 03:10.460]  It's got that EQ bar on there.
[03:10.460 --> 03:13.660]  We've got a, I should mention, these are made by Alpine Hemp Company.
[03:13.660 --> 03:16.860]  These are a hemp hat made by our friends at Alpine Hemp Company.
[03:16.860 --> 03:18.420]  Big shout out to Alpine Hemp.
[03:18.420 --> 03:20.740]  Got the Grow From Your Heart podcast logo on the front.
[03:20.740 --> 03:23.420]  On the bill here, we've got the red, yellow, and green stitching.
[03:23.420 --> 03:24.980]  I'll hold that up closer to the camera there.
[03:24.980 --> 03:25.980]  I'm sure it's picking it up.
[03:25.980 --> 03:27.340]  I can't see what's happening.
[03:27.340 --> 03:30.500]  It does have the Alpine Hemp sticker that does come off when you're ready or leave it
[03:30.500 --> 03:32.340]  on there if you're that guy.
[03:32.340 --> 03:34.740]  We've got the Alpine Hemp hang tag here.
[03:34.740 --> 03:39.060]  We do have the red, yellow, and green stitching across the top of the hat.
[03:39.060 --> 03:43.380]  Then we've got the, it says GFYHTV on the side here.
[03:43.380 --> 03:47.940]  On this side, we've got the Alpine Hemp Co. tag, which is also, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:47.940 --> 03:49.620]  that is a joint caddy.
[03:49.620 --> 03:50.620]  That's right.
[03:50.620 --> 03:51.620]  You can stick a joint in there.
[03:51.620 --> 03:52.620]  I've got a pin here.
[03:52.620 --> 03:53.620]  I can show you with the pin.
[03:53.620 --> 03:56.660]  I don't have a joint handy, but you could stick a pin right in there and that would
[03:56.660 --> 03:58.660]  work also as a joint caddy.
[03:58.660 --> 04:00.360]  You could rock a fat spliff up there.
[04:00.360 --> 04:02.840]  Please have a joint ready to smoke.
[04:02.840 --> 04:06.640]  Please be careful if you're ... Only do that in legal locations.
[04:06.640 --> 04:08.080]  But we've got a joint caddy up there.
[04:08.080 --> 04:10.160]  Also, we've got the cool red hemp tag back here.
[04:10.160 --> 04:13.240]  Let everybody know you're rocking the hemp hat that you care about the world, about the
[04:13.240 --> 04:14.240]  planet.
[04:14.240 --> 04:15.720]  We're using hemp now.
[04:15.720 --> 04:17.160]  On the inside, you probably already saw it.
[04:17.160 --> 04:18.480]  I haven't spoken about it.
[04:18.480 --> 04:22.640]  This is printed with a sublimated image of blue raspberry truffle seeds.
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.800]  If I remember correctly, that is an image of blue raspberry truffle seeds made to look
[04:26.800 --> 04:28.640]  like you've got seeds inside the hat.
[04:28.640 --> 04:30.640]  Of course, red, yellow, green liner.
[04:30.640 --> 04:33.160]  Got to keep it Rasta for the Rasta Jeff style here.
[04:33.160 --> 04:38.360]  These hats, my friends, my fellow smokers and growers, these are available on the web
[04:38.360 --> 04:39.360]  store.
[04:39.360 --> 04:41.260]  Simply hit the website, iReedGenetics.com.
[04:41.260 --> 04:42.440]  Click on the merch store.
[04:42.440 --> 04:43.440]  That will take you right there.
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.000]  If you were supporting on Patreon, you've already got the link.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.240]  Go check Patreon.
[04:48.240 --> 04:51.800]  I'm not sure where it will show you, but you may get an email.
[04:51.800 --> 04:52.800]  It'll pop up.
[04:52.800 --> 04:53.800]  Go look for it.
[04:53.800 --> 04:54.800]  Thank you guys for the continued support.
[04:54.800 --> 04:57.360]  That went longer than it was supposed to.
[04:57.360 --> 05:01.320]  Also, I will blow out some of the other merch when you go for the coupon code.
[05:01.320 --> 05:03.400]  That will be valid on all of the merchandise.
[05:03.400 --> 05:08.720]  Shirts, stickers, grinders, rolling trays, dab mats, a lot of stuff will be getting blown
[05:08.720 --> 05:09.720]  out.
[05:09.720 --> 05:10.720]  Then we're going to add more merch.
[05:10.720 --> 05:11.720]  We got to blow out some of this merch.
[05:11.720 --> 05:12.720]  Here's the deal.
[05:12.720 --> 05:13.720]  Here's what I'm trying to do.
[05:13.720 --> 05:16.640]  I've got a couple of boxes with like random shit in it and there's not enough stuff in
[05:16.640 --> 05:19.400]  those boxes to make those boxes sitting there.
[05:19.400 --> 05:24.520]  Want to liquidate and consolidate some merchandise so that we can get new merchandise.
[05:24.520 --> 05:25.520]  Spring is coming.
[05:25.520 --> 05:27.600]  I'm going to have to order some new merch for the spring.
[05:27.600 --> 05:33.480]  If you have any merch ideas for spring, Grow From Your Heart podcast, iRegenetics merchandise,
[05:33.480 --> 05:35.640]  I would love to see your designs.
[05:35.640 --> 05:40.020]  If it's a certain merch piece that I haven't offered, I like to offer things that are useful
[05:40.020 --> 05:44.920]  and practical to the community as merchandise, the grinders, rolling trays, things like that.
[05:44.920 --> 05:47.920]  I'm sure you're using those exactly as anticipated.
[05:47.920 --> 05:48.920]  Hats are cool.
[05:48.920 --> 05:49.920]  You can wear them.
[05:49.920 --> 05:50.920]  Shirts are cool.
[05:50.920 --> 05:51.920]  What am I missing?
[05:51.920 --> 05:54.200]  If you're part of the merch marketing team, let me know what else I should make.
[05:54.880 --> 05:59.240]  If you've got some designs, if there's a strain that I put out that doesn't have cool artwork
[05:59.240 --> 06:01.040]  and you make some artwork, let me know.
[06:01.040 --> 06:02.720]  Maybe we can use your artwork.
[06:02.720 --> 06:05.680]  Also keep in mind, we have to be careful with some of the strains that I've created.
[06:05.680 --> 06:08.960]  We can't make art for all of them because that may get us in trouble.
[06:08.960 --> 06:13.400]  If the strain name is derived from something famous already, we probably shouldn't make
[06:13.400 --> 06:17.260]  artwork for it, but some things we could definitely use artwork for.
[06:17.260 --> 06:19.840]  Now I feel like I'm begging for art, begging for your help out there.
[06:19.840 --> 06:21.520]  I like crowdsourcing.
[06:21.520 --> 06:22.520]  You guys taught me design.
[06:22.960 --> 06:25.680]  My friends on Discord helped me design this hat here.
[06:25.680 --> 06:26.800]  It seems to be working.
[06:26.800 --> 06:28.320]  I like the crowd help.
[06:28.320 --> 06:30.320]  You guys are going to be wearing it, rocking it, using it.
[06:30.320 --> 06:31.320]  Why not get your feedback?
[06:31.320 --> 06:32.800]  Where do we go from there?
[06:32.800 --> 06:36.080]  I think we've talked about all this stuff on the notes here.
[06:36.080 --> 06:41.200]  Let's get into the topic of this podcast, which is your mom.
[06:41.200 --> 06:43.640]  Your mom plans to be more specific.
[06:43.640 --> 06:44.800]  I do have an email here.
[06:44.800 --> 06:47.760]  This one came from our friend, Used to be Cool.
[06:47.760 --> 06:51.120]  Used to be Cool has been listening to the podcast for a long time, has not emailed with
[06:51.120 --> 06:54.680]  a question in quite a while, which makes me feel like our friend is learning quite
[06:54.680 --> 06:55.680]  a bit.
[06:55.680 --> 06:56.680]  They've gotten confident in the growth.
[06:56.680 --> 06:58.000]  They haven't needed my help, which makes me proud.
[06:58.000 --> 06:59.440]  I do appreciate that.
[06:59.440 --> 07:02.720]  I left the mechanic shop the other day and I said, it was good seeing you, bro, but I
[07:02.720 --> 07:04.600]  really hope I don't have to see you for a while.
[07:04.600 --> 07:07.320]  He understood exactly what I meant.
[07:07.320 --> 07:09.720]  Every time I see him, something's wrong with the damn car.
[07:09.720 --> 07:11.600]  Didn't want to have to see him for a while.
[07:11.600 --> 07:14.340]  I think that our buddy Used to be Cool is doing great because he hasn't messaged me
[07:14.340 --> 07:16.480]  with a problem in a long time.
[07:16.480 --> 07:19.360]  This one, I will quit rambling and we'll cut to the chase.
[07:19.360 --> 07:20.920]  It goes a little bit like this.
[07:21.720 --> 07:24.280]  If you read this on your show, please don't use my real name.
[07:24.280 --> 07:26.320]  Brother We, I've read a lot of your messages.
[07:26.320 --> 07:27.840]  I know you as Used to be Cool.
[07:27.840 --> 07:30.880]  When I see your real name, it just translates into my brain.
[07:30.880 --> 07:31.880]  There's a switch.
[07:31.880 --> 07:32.880]  I get it by now, bro.
[07:32.880 --> 07:33.880]  Big love, big respect.
[07:33.880 --> 07:35.600]  Thank you for being around for so long.
[07:35.600 --> 07:38.600]  It says, I have a question about keeping a mother plant.
[07:38.600 --> 07:43.240]  I have never kept a cut beyond a few runs, mainly because of space restrictions.
[07:43.240 --> 07:44.240]  That is completely understandable.
[07:44.240 --> 07:46.480]  I'm here in the state of Colorado.
[07:46.480 --> 07:49.120]  If you've got recreational cannabis, you are allowed six plants.
[07:49.120 --> 07:53.400]  If you've got your medical recommendation, you're allowed an additional six in most cities
[07:53.400 --> 07:54.800]  and counties.
[07:54.800 --> 07:55.800]  Most places limit you.
[07:55.800 --> 07:57.840]  A lot of people talk about their extended plant count.
[07:57.840 --> 08:01.840]  A lot of cities and counties don't give a shit about your extended plant count.
[08:01.840 --> 08:05.000]  You are limited to six and 12.
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.800]  It says, however, I found a plant.
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.400]  I want to explore a little.
[08:09.400 --> 08:10.560]  My dude fell in love.
[08:10.560 --> 08:11.560]  Congratulations, brother.
[08:11.560 --> 08:12.560]  I know that feeling.
[08:12.560 --> 08:13.560]  Trust me.
[08:13.560 --> 08:17.160]  It says, it was the only female from a pack of freebies.
[08:17.200 --> 08:20.160]  Well, that's cool that the female freebie was awesome.
[08:20.160 --> 08:22.440]  The female freebie was fucking fantastic.
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.960]  It's fabulous to found her.
[08:23.960 --> 08:25.080]  You say that five times fast.
[08:25.080 --> 08:26.800]  I'll send you a pack of seeds.
[08:26.800 --> 08:28.520]  And so she can't be replaced.
[08:28.520 --> 08:29.640]  Yes, I know that feeling.
[08:29.640 --> 08:34.040]  I've got a lot of female cuts that cannot be replaced, especially my male cut.
[08:34.040 --> 08:36.560]  Imagine if we had to find another King Solomon.
[08:36.560 --> 08:37.560]  It goes on.
[08:37.560 --> 08:38.560]  I'm rambling today, you guys.
[08:38.560 --> 08:39.560]  I must have smoked some good shit.
[08:39.560 --> 08:40.560]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[08:40.560 --> 08:44.760]  It says, however, I realize I don't really know how to keep a mom.
[08:44.760 --> 08:50.000]  My specific question is whether I should multi-top the plant to increase branches so
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.720]  I can harvest more cuts or simply let it grow naturally and let the cuts I take also count
[08:55.720 --> 08:57.120]  as topping.
[08:57.120 --> 09:02.440]  I would also just like some basic information about how long to keep the mother before flowering
[09:02.440 --> 09:06.000]  it out and starting a new mom and any other.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.560]  It looks like my printer just fucking gave up at that point.
[09:08.560 --> 09:09.840]  I was like, nope, I'm done printing.
[09:09.840 --> 09:10.840]  So that's what we got here.
[09:10.840 --> 09:12.560]  It ends with and any other.
[09:12.560 --> 09:15.280]  I'm pretty sure you're going to ask for any other information that I can provide to help
[09:15.280 --> 09:16.280]  you.
[09:16.280 --> 09:18.440]  I keep a mother plant happy, set you up for success.
[09:18.440 --> 09:21.880]  Let's get into that because I do have a lot of useful tips being a breeder, a long time
[09:21.880 --> 09:22.880]  cultivator.
[09:22.880 --> 09:23.880]  I've kept cuts around.
[09:23.880 --> 09:26.440]  Excuse me for having to hear that for a moment.
[09:26.440 --> 09:29.280]  I've kept cuts around for a long time.
[09:29.280 --> 09:33.480]  I've talked about a flow plant that I had for 2008.
[09:33.480 --> 09:35.840]  I probably had that fucker for 10, 12.
[09:35.840 --> 09:39.120]  Man, I probably had that plant for 12 years.
[09:39.120 --> 09:40.200]  We're just going to say 12 years.
[09:40.200 --> 09:41.200]  I don't know exactly.
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.240]  But 10 or 12 years, I had a flow plant by keeping a mother plant of it.
[09:45.240 --> 09:48.720]  When that mother plant would outgrow the pot or outgrow the shape.
[09:48.720 --> 09:51.280]  Sometimes they just, you cut them and take mom, like take clones off when they start
[09:51.280 --> 09:53.120]  getting unshapely and unruly.
[09:53.120 --> 09:56.600]  I would just take another fresh cut and rejuvenate and start fresh.
[09:56.600 --> 09:59.400]  That's a thing as a breeder with the selection of mom plants.
[09:59.400 --> 10:01.240]  That's something that I do routinely.
[10:01.240 --> 10:04.760]  It's about every six months, sometimes sooner depending on the cuts.
[10:04.760 --> 10:05.760]  The Congo grows too fast.
[10:05.760 --> 10:08.880]  She has to be remodeled too early.
[10:08.880 --> 10:12.120]  I try to remod my shed occasionally just to keep the genetics fresh, just to keep them
[10:12.120 --> 10:14.040]  ruly, the shape that I want.
[10:14.040 --> 10:15.600]  You started with a very good question.
[10:15.600 --> 10:18.280]  Let me get back on track here.
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.200]  Let me back up into something that you should have done further.
[10:22.200 --> 10:23.200]  You didn't make a mistake.
[10:23.200 --> 10:25.120]  You didn't know this was going to be a champion.
[10:25.120 --> 10:26.600]  You did not know to keep a clone.
[10:26.600 --> 10:32.400]  This is why I say, always keep a clone of every plant you grow.
[10:32.400 --> 10:33.400]  I'm a breeder.
[10:33.400 --> 10:35.160]  I run a lot of test seeds.
[10:35.160 --> 10:37.640]  It is hard to keep a clone of everything.
[10:38.480 --> 10:41.520]  A lot of times I'm willing to just let it go because I've got enough seeds where I can
[10:41.520 --> 10:43.040]  run it and find it again.
[10:43.040 --> 10:44.320]  I've seen what I wanted to see.
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.320]  That can go.
[10:45.320 --> 10:47.040]  I'm not too attached a lot of the time.
[10:47.040 --> 10:48.440]  Sometimes I do wish I had a keeper.
[10:48.440 --> 10:49.480]  I wish I would have kept it.
[10:49.480 --> 10:52.280]  In that case, what I will do is revege a plant.
[10:52.280 --> 10:55.160]  It's never too late to cut a clone off of a plant.
[10:55.160 --> 10:58.640]  If you've decided that that plant is fucking fire, you want it, cut a clone.
[10:58.640 --> 11:01.640]  Keep that around or revege that plant after you harvest.
[11:01.640 --> 11:06.920]  I've done full episodes on cutting clones, reveging, monster cropping.
[11:06.960 --> 11:08.320]  I've done episodes on all of that.
[11:08.320 --> 11:09.320]  That's all available.
[11:09.320 --> 11:14.040]  Always take a clone because you never know if it's going to be fire.
[11:14.040 --> 11:15.040]  You never, ever know.
[11:15.040 --> 11:18.080]  Just like this case, it's the only female and it needs to be kept.
[11:18.080 --> 11:23.000]  If you would have had a clone, if you have a clone, then you can keep this going on.
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.080]  Hopefully you've got a clone, but always keep a clone.
[11:26.080 --> 11:27.080]  That's something I talk about.
[11:27.080 --> 11:28.080]  Then where are we?
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.720]  Or learn to revege.
[11:29.720 --> 11:32.080]  I have reveged a bud.
[11:32.080 --> 11:33.640]  I may have talked about this on the show before.
[11:33.640 --> 11:38.720]  I was at a friend's greenhouse and he had plants that were pretty far along.
[11:38.720 --> 11:40.920]  It was almost smokeable, but not quite.
[11:40.920 --> 11:44.640]  He thought it would be nice and clip me off a little bud, like a good size bud, and toss
[11:44.640 --> 11:45.640]  it to me.
[11:45.640 --> 11:47.160]  He's like, go home and smoke that and let me know what you think.
[11:47.160 --> 11:48.960]  I was like, well, it's way too early.
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.760]  I'm going to think it's crap, but that was super nice of you because our buddy White
[11:52.760 --> 11:54.080]  Mike had the brilliant idea.
[11:54.080 --> 11:56.040]  He said, if you don't clone that, you fucked up.
[11:56.040 --> 11:58.960]  I was like, dude, I think we're thinking the same exact thing.
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.720]  We drove straight to the house, put it in some CloneX, put it in a dome, got it going,
[12:03.720 --> 12:07.040]  put it in a clone plug, put it in a dome, got it going as a clone.
[12:07.040 --> 12:08.720]  That fucker rooted and it reveged.
[12:08.720 --> 12:11.520]  I had a clone on my friend's plant that he didn't know that I had.
[12:11.520 --> 12:13.160]  Kept it around to me.
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.000]  Maybe, maybe I've bred something to it recently that we can't talk about yet here on the show
[12:17.000 --> 12:19.120]  because people don't even know that that's what they're testing.
[12:19.120 --> 12:21.720]  Let me keep myself on track here.
[12:21.720 --> 12:22.720]  You can clone.
[12:22.720 --> 12:25.720]  It's never too late to clone something, revege it, and rescue it.
[12:25.720 --> 12:27.960]  Now, let's talk more about keeping a mom plant.
[12:27.960 --> 12:31.440]  Your first question is how do you shape it to provide clones?
[12:31.440 --> 12:33.400]  That is a very good question.
[12:33.400 --> 12:35.800]  It is all about your goal.
[12:35.800 --> 12:38.160]  I don't know how many clones you need.
[12:38.160 --> 12:41.120]  I don't know how your growth style is.
[12:41.120 --> 12:45.120]  The main thing, I always take that middle top right out and make that a clone because
[12:45.120 --> 12:48.120]  all the other branches are going to grow to a certain height and that top is going to
[12:48.120 --> 12:49.680]  keep going and fuck everything up.
[12:49.680 --> 12:54.320]  You're going to have to adjust the light and everything because of that top bud, that top
[12:54.320 --> 12:56.680]  node, that apical dominant node.
[12:56.800 --> 12:57.800]  Take that out.
[12:57.800 --> 12:58.800]  Use that as a clone.
[12:58.800 --> 12:59.800]  Now, you've got a nice even canopy.
[12:59.800 --> 13:03.440]  Now, you've got a lot of options for cloning once it starts to grow.
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.560]  As a home grower, you're probably, I'm assuming here, you're probably not going to need more
[13:07.560 --> 13:09.160]  than six, 12, maybe 20.
[13:09.160 --> 13:11.880]  I don't know your state, your limit, what you're doing.
[13:11.880 --> 13:13.760]  You're not going to need a lot of clones.
[13:13.760 --> 13:19.120]  One mother plant in a three to five gallon pot can provide a lot of clones, but you have
[13:19.120 --> 13:24.320]  to learn how to shape it to provide those clones and where to cut from to keep the plant
[13:24.320 --> 13:27.960]  active and growing to give you even more clones once you've cut it.
[13:27.960 --> 13:29.840]  It's kind of learning the plant.
[13:29.840 --> 13:34.680]  If you've got a plant that is squat and stout and it makes a lot of branching, it's easier
[13:34.680 --> 13:36.400]  to get more clones more frequently.
[13:36.400 --> 13:41.800]  If you've got a tall, stretchy plant, like the Congo, there aren't a lot of places to
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.220]  clone from, but there's a lot of plant material because it's so fucking long, but it's one
[13:46.220 --> 13:48.960]  big main with like eight side branches.
[13:48.960 --> 13:53.680]  If I were to clone from it, I could get nine clones maybe, but I've got some, let's talk
[13:53.680 --> 13:56.120]  about the Chernobyl plant that I've got.
[13:56.120 --> 14:00.960]  That fucker grows real short, real squat and makes one main top that takes off within a
[14:00.960 --> 14:02.120]  lot of side branching.
[14:02.120 --> 14:06.400]  I could get 40 clones off of a plant the same size as I could the Congo just because of
[14:06.400 --> 14:08.280]  the shape and structure of the plant.
[14:08.280 --> 14:09.640]  So that's going to have a lot to do with it.
[14:09.640 --> 14:13.960]  The main things are the shape and structure of the plant, the size of the plant, and then
[14:13.960 --> 14:16.160]  how many clones and how frequently do you need them?
[14:16.160 --> 14:20.240]  So I always start with that main top, take that out, let them grow evenly, and then as
[14:20.240 --> 14:24.040]  they get taller, take those as your next round of clones and they'll start catching
[14:24.040 --> 14:25.040]  up.
[14:25.040 --> 14:26.040]  Eventually you'll have like a hedge.
[14:26.040 --> 14:29.480]  Then you can, you'll learn when I cut here, always cut at the node when there's another
[14:29.480 --> 14:30.480]  node sticking up.
[14:30.480 --> 14:33.640]  So you got your main branch and you got another, let me come down, let me adjust this mic and
[14:33.640 --> 14:34.640]  get my shit together.
[14:34.640 --> 14:36.080]  That was awkward the way I did that.
[14:36.080 --> 14:37.320]  You got the main branch coming up.
[14:37.320 --> 14:38.400]  This is your main branch, right?
[14:38.400 --> 14:40.360]  These are leaves, whatever, my fingers are leaves.
[14:40.360 --> 14:44.880]  You got a node right here sticking off, top it right before that, and that new one will
[14:44.880 --> 14:45.880]  make another branch.
[14:45.880 --> 14:48.440]  If you do it where there's one coming up here and one coming up here, you just made two
[14:48.520 --> 14:50.200]  tops where there was one.
[14:50.200 --> 14:54.320]  And now the next time you cut, you got this sticking out and now you got two tops and
[14:54.320 --> 14:56.800]  you can, those will make more tops.
[14:56.800 --> 14:59.840]  It'll do the same thing and you can cut the tops out of there and then you'll make four
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.840]  out of it.
[15:00.840 --> 15:04.460]  And if you, once you figure out that art, you'll get really good at it.
[15:04.460 --> 15:09.480]  Keep in mind that you can reclone this plant, get a clone of it, grow it out, keep it as
[15:09.480 --> 15:11.240]  a mother plant.
[15:11.240 --> 15:15.520]  Then once it gets unruly, unshapely, use one of your clones as your new mother plant and
[15:15.520 --> 15:19.200]  keep practicing to achieve the shape you need.
[15:19.200 --> 15:21.400]  You desire the shape that reaches your goal.
[15:21.400 --> 15:22.400]  All right.
[15:22.400 --> 15:24.480]  I do have a bunch of notes here that I didn't even talk about.
[15:24.480 --> 15:26.960]  I've been going for quite a while.
[15:26.960 --> 15:29.320]  Mom question, selection.
[15:29.320 --> 15:30.360]  It's all about selection.
[15:30.360 --> 15:31.920]  What works best for you?
[15:31.920 --> 15:33.880]  Sounds like you found one you want to play with.
[15:33.880 --> 15:36.040]  You've got a plant that you want to turn into a mother plant.
[15:36.040 --> 15:39.720]  I would recommend keeping it under a veg light.
[15:39.720 --> 15:43.120]  I don't have this note written down, so I want to talk about this quickly.
[15:43.120 --> 15:49.680]  If you don't up pot your mother plants, sometimes some plants do have the potential to begin
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.360]  to auto flower or show you problems once they get root bound.
[15:53.360 --> 15:58.440]  So keep it in a big enough pot for it to grow wide and strong, have a healthy root zone.
[15:58.440 --> 16:01.760]  That way it can branch out, bush out, and provide you the clones you need.
[16:01.760 --> 16:03.680]  So pot size is very important.
[16:03.680 --> 16:07.600]  Then after that, I'm going to say that veg light is very important.
[16:07.600 --> 16:09.520]  Light cycle.
[16:09.520 --> 16:11.040]  The same with the pot size.
[16:11.040 --> 16:15.920]  If you don't give it enough light, if you don't give it enough air, enough space, if the VPD is off,
[16:15.920 --> 16:20.560]  if this plant gets stressed out and you keep it around for a while, it may try to flower on you.
[16:20.560 --> 16:22.960]  So give it enough light.
[16:22.960 --> 16:27.120]  We're going to talk about daily light integral in a very soon upcoming episode here, but
[16:27.120 --> 16:30.880]  depending on the kind of light you're giving it, the intensity and the amount of hours,
[16:30.880 --> 16:32.520]  pay attention to that light.
[16:32.520 --> 16:33.520]  Pay attention to the plant.
[16:33.520 --> 16:36.800]  Give it enough light to where it will not go into flower.
[16:36.800 --> 16:39.520]  Sometimes I run 18-6 for my moms.
[16:39.520 --> 16:44.840]  Often if I've got full control of everything, it'll be 20 on and 4 off for my mother plants.
[16:44.840 --> 16:47.360]  Give them those two hours extra of light.
[16:47.360 --> 16:49.080]  Just makes them grow stronger.
[16:49.080 --> 16:50.240]  Prevents them from flowering.
[16:50.240 --> 16:53.960]  They don't even get the idea that it's dark enough to think about flowering.
[16:53.960 --> 16:56.360]  And then they get four hours for the plant to sleep.
[16:56.360 --> 17:00.240]  A lot of the root cycles, a lot of the stuff happening down there in the rhizosphere happens
[17:00.240 --> 17:01.240]  in the night.
[17:01.240 --> 17:04.760]  A lot of the growth stuff happens in the night.
[17:04.760 --> 17:07.320]  So I want my equipment to get a four hour rest.
[17:07.320 --> 17:10.320]  That's four hours of electricity I don't have to pay for.
[17:10.320 --> 17:13.760]  Four hours longer my bulb will last every day.
[17:13.760 --> 17:16.920]  It doesn't seem like a big deal in a home grow, in a small cultivation, but if you're
[17:16.920 --> 17:23.200]  running a large scale commercial cultivation facility, your mom room can be, I've been
[17:23.200 --> 17:27.120]  in a veg room, a mom room with 50-100 lights just vegging and mom.
[17:27.120 --> 17:32.000]  I've been in much larger, but I'm just saying it can be 50 lights just for mother plants,
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.040]  just for keeping genetics and small clones around can be a lot.
[17:35.040 --> 17:39.120]  So if you can minimize the amount of lights that are on, the time, give your equipment
[17:39.120 --> 17:41.280]  some rest, that will save some on the bill.
[17:41.280 --> 17:45.600]  Also time on your equipment, less fans running, less shit happening.
[17:45.600 --> 17:47.040]  Everything costs a little something.
[17:47.040 --> 17:49.160]  Right now everything costs a lot more.
[17:49.160 --> 17:50.440]  We don't need to talk about that.
[17:50.440 --> 17:52.680]  But lights, think about lighting.
[17:52.680 --> 17:55.600]  We want veg lighting, blue lighting.
[17:55.600 --> 17:59.980]  If you've got the options for switching, if you're old school, you do HPS and metal halides,
[17:59.980 --> 18:02.000]  you want the blue metal halides right now.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.700]  If your LED light has a switch for veg or flower, switch that fucker to veg.
[18:06.700 --> 18:07.700]  That's where you want to be.
[18:07.700 --> 18:09.140]  The most blue light you can give it.
[18:09.140 --> 18:13.000]  I'm not an expert on lighting, but we do want veg lights at this point.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.740]  Also to go with that veg light, we do want vegetative nutrients.
[18:16.740 --> 18:19.900]  I focus mainly on that nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium.
[18:19.900 --> 18:22.260]  Of course, they're going to need a little bit of cow mag.
[18:22.260 --> 18:23.260]  They're not in flower.
[18:23.260 --> 18:24.500]  They're not in high performance mode.
[18:24.500 --> 18:27.780]  Once they get bigger and the soil burns out, whatever you got them in, you will need to
[18:27.780 --> 18:29.460]  feed them cow mag and other things.
[18:29.940 --> 18:32.820]  But think about the basics, just basic veg nudes.
[18:32.820 --> 18:34.940]  I like to feed them a lot of microbes.
[18:34.940 --> 18:38.980]  I feed everything a shit ton of microbes just because I think that keeps the soil moving.
[18:38.980 --> 18:42.220]  We're going to talk in the future about overfeeding of microbes.
[18:42.220 --> 18:44.260]  But feed it veg nutrients, basically.
[18:44.260 --> 18:46.020]  Your basic vegetative nutrients.
[18:46.020 --> 18:48.300]  You don't have to give it all the boosters and shit because you're not trying to make
[18:48.300 --> 18:49.940]  it grow, grow, grow.
[18:49.940 --> 18:55.020]  We're just trying to make it a big enough plant to provide healthy, happy cuts.
[18:55.020 --> 18:56.980]  Then we're going to touch on something I already talked about.
[18:56.980 --> 19:03.500]  Keep it to offer the amount of clones you need at the frequency of which you need them.
[19:03.500 --> 19:07.620]  Maybe some people keep a one gallon, tiny bonsai mother plant that they take one clone
[19:07.620 --> 19:10.780]  off of and it grows a little bit bigger and they take two off of.
[19:10.780 --> 19:12.020]  They let it grow a little bit bigger.
[19:12.020 --> 19:15.300]  Next time they get three, then they up-pot that into a bigger pot.
[19:15.300 --> 19:19.020]  Or maybe they just abandon that one and use one of the other clones and keep going because
[19:19.020 --> 19:21.300]  they cannot have large plants.
[19:21.300 --> 19:25.580]  Or maybe you grow gigantic fucking plants that you've just got hedged up and trimmed
[19:25.580 --> 19:29.180]  up as much as you can and you're just taking thousands of cuts at a time.
[19:29.180 --> 19:30.180]  It's all about your goal.
[19:30.180 --> 19:32.340]  I talked about shaping it.
[19:32.340 --> 19:36.660]  Shaping the plant will become an art once you realize when I cut here, this branch will
[19:36.660 --> 19:37.660]  grow this way.
[19:37.660 --> 19:39.220]  When I cut here, these two split this way.
[19:39.220 --> 19:42.660]  You kind of have to do it to learn it and you'll experience it and you'll figure it
[19:42.660 --> 19:44.740]  out very quickly on a couple of plants.
[19:44.740 --> 19:46.700]  So shape it the way you want.
[19:46.700 --> 19:47.780]  Mother plants can be small.
[19:47.780 --> 19:48.780]  They can be huge.
[19:48.780 --> 19:52.700]  It depends on how many you want to keep around and how many cuts you're going to need.
[19:52.820 --> 19:56.180]  I generally keep my mother plants in a three to five gallon pot.
[19:56.180 --> 19:59.460]  I keep them fairly far apart so the wind can blow and they don't get any issues.
[19:59.460 --> 20:05.180]  And when I apply a sprayed pesticide or foliar feed, that was harder to say than it looked,
[20:05.180 --> 20:09.340]  they're far enough apart that I can get all of the plants carefully and individually.
[20:09.340 --> 20:11.500]  I keep them in the three to five gallon pot.
[20:11.500 --> 20:16.860]  I veg them out or I keep them, I guess, I try to keep them around 18 inches, 24 inches
[20:16.860 --> 20:17.860]  tall.
[20:17.860 --> 20:20.020]  Sometimes I'll hit about three feet tall.
[20:20.020 --> 20:23.100]  Once they get about that three feet tall, they start getting unruly, out of control.
[20:23.100 --> 20:25.220]  I have to make too many adjustments.
[20:25.220 --> 20:28.580]  That's when I'll take as many clones as I can get from one plant.
[20:28.580 --> 20:31.020]  I'll get as many clones as I can get from that one plant.
[20:31.020 --> 20:32.860]  So I'll make sure that I'm going to get a keeper.
[20:32.860 --> 20:38.060]  I'll have a row of all of my mom plants in a clone dome temporarily.
[20:38.060 --> 20:39.580]  We'll get roots as soon as I see roots.
[20:39.580 --> 20:44.300]  And as soon as I know I've got security, I will toss that big mother plant or maybe I'll
[20:44.300 --> 20:45.300]  put it into flower.
[20:45.300 --> 20:47.020]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[20:47.020 --> 20:48.700]  Maybe I'll drag it out to the greenhouse.
[20:48.700 --> 20:49.860]  I pointed right there.
[20:49.900 --> 20:50.900]  It's not right there.
[20:50.900 --> 20:51.900]  It's way the fuck out there.
[20:51.900 --> 20:55.020]  But we'll take it out to the greenhouse out in the middle of nowhere, put it out there,
[20:55.020 --> 20:56.020]  make some seeds out of it.
[20:56.020 --> 20:57.020]  You never know what could happen.
[20:57.020 --> 21:00.900]  But oftentimes, once they get big and unruly, I whack them down.
[21:00.900 --> 21:02.020]  It hurts Mike's feelings.
[21:02.020 --> 21:05.180]  Mike has been here and helped me put giant plants in trash cans and he just shakes his
[21:05.180 --> 21:07.620]  head and he's like, buddy, I wish we could put these outside.
[21:07.620 --> 21:09.940]  I'm like, bro, it's fucking December.
[21:09.940 --> 21:12.860]  We could, but they're just going to freeze and it's going to be like, it's heartbreaking
[21:12.860 --> 21:14.620]  a little bit to chop down giant plants.
[21:14.620 --> 21:18.380]  But once you realize those plants have given me a hundred clones and they've served their
[21:18.380 --> 21:23.140]  purpose, they've made a thousand seeds and 500 other plants and 40 pounds of weed.
[21:23.140 --> 21:25.060]  And you start thinking about all the other shit they produced.
[21:25.060 --> 21:27.740]  It's okay that that big mother plant goes bye bye.
[21:27.740 --> 21:30.140]  So some people are going to keep big mother plants.
[21:30.140 --> 21:32.620]  Some people are going to keep a small mother plants.
[21:32.620 --> 21:36.340]  I think I keep medium sized mother plants, two to three feet tall.
[21:36.340 --> 21:38.420]  They're about probably I'm a drummer.
[21:38.420 --> 21:39.700]  That's probably 18 inches around.
[21:39.700 --> 21:43.660]  I'm thinking about the size of a good floor, Tom, 16, 18 inches, 18 inches around at the
[21:43.660 --> 21:44.660]  top.
[21:44.660 --> 21:47.060]  I can get plenty of cuts from those.
[21:47.060 --> 21:48.580]  And sometimes let's talk about this.
[21:48.580 --> 21:51.140]  Is this on my notes in this direction?
[21:51.140 --> 21:57.700]  Occasionally I will just drag that mother plant in quotation marks into the flower room
[21:57.700 --> 21:59.140]  and bloom it out.
[21:59.140 --> 22:04.820]  If you were using this mother plant as a clone donor while it vegged and you used those clones
[22:04.820 --> 22:09.460]  to shape that plant, I always talk about when I'm running a new plant, I take that main
[22:09.460 --> 22:11.900]  top out and use that as a clone.
[22:11.900 --> 22:15.580]  When I'm lollipopping, I take two of the bottoms off and I use those as clones.
[22:15.580 --> 22:17.700]  Now I've got three clones.
[22:17.700 --> 22:22.260]  I could do that with a mother plant and then flower it just as easily as I did with my
[22:22.260 --> 22:23.580]  new seedling.
[22:23.580 --> 22:31.020]  Sometimes if you don't have space for a full on dedicated mother plant or an arsenal of
[22:31.020 --> 22:35.620]  mother plants, let's say that you're limited to only 12 plants and you want to keep a genetic
[22:35.620 --> 22:39.580]  around, but you can't dedicate a mother space or a mother room.
[22:39.580 --> 22:43.060]  Use your veg plants as a mother plant.
[22:43.060 --> 22:47.180]  Let's say we want to grow, let's say lemon Jeffrey.
[22:47.180 --> 22:48.380]  You've got a lemon Jeffrey plant.
[22:48.380 --> 22:52.040]  You want to grow it over and over again, but you can't keep a dedicated mom.
[22:52.040 --> 22:53.460]  You've got a plant of it.
[22:53.460 --> 22:55.020]  Grow it up like you're going to veg it.
[22:55.020 --> 22:56.260]  Take the top out.
[22:56.260 --> 22:57.420]  Take a clone of that.
[22:57.420 --> 23:00.380]  Take the two bottoms off of it because you're going to clean the bottom of this plant up
[23:00.380 --> 23:01.380]  anyway.
[23:01.380 --> 23:02.460]  Take two bottoms off of it.
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.460]  Create clones out of that.
[23:03.460 --> 23:05.220]  Now you've got three clones.
[23:05.220 --> 23:06.380]  One of them should root.
[23:06.380 --> 23:10.260]  If you've watched my clone tech video, there's a full podcast about cutting clones.
[23:10.260 --> 23:11.780]  I cut clones in the video.
[23:11.780 --> 23:15.140]  If you watch that, follow that SOP, you will have success.
[23:15.140 --> 23:17.540]  One of those three clones will root if you do this.
[23:17.540 --> 23:19.780]  So get the three clones.
[23:19.780 --> 23:22.620]  Now once you've got your three clones and you're sure that they're going to root, you
[23:22.620 --> 23:27.220]  can drag that big plant into the flower room and just take good care of those clones.
[23:27.220 --> 23:31.180]  Maybe wait a little bit longer if you're not super experienced, but you've got secure cuts.
[23:31.180 --> 23:33.580]  You can keep vegging also if your veg time isn't up.
[23:33.580 --> 23:38.900]  If you're still vegging, waiting longer, you can cut those clones, get them rooted, put
[23:38.900 --> 23:42.900]  them into a small pot, let them grow, and you've got three of them over there.
[23:42.900 --> 23:46.340]  Now you've got mother plants for backup.
[23:46.340 --> 23:47.660]  Pick the best one.
[23:47.660 --> 23:51.420]  Keep that as your growing plant or keep those three for veg for the next run.
[23:51.420 --> 23:53.260]  You've got plants for the next run.
[23:53.260 --> 23:54.260]  And then guess what?
[23:54.260 --> 23:57.020]  When it's time to run the next run, you've got those three plants.
[23:57.020 --> 23:58.740]  Take the three tops as clones.
[23:58.740 --> 24:01.540]  You could probably pull a fucking nine or 12 off the bottom of those.
[24:01.540 --> 24:05.300]  Now you got at least three to 12 clones to fuck with again.
[24:05.300 --> 24:06.980]  Drag those big plants into the flower room.
[24:06.980 --> 24:08.300]  You got your clones.
[24:08.300 --> 24:09.300]  Pot those.
[24:09.300 --> 24:10.300]  Pot them again.
[24:10.300 --> 24:11.300]  Veg them.
[24:11.300 --> 24:12.300]  Get them stronger.
[24:12.300 --> 24:13.300]  Repeat the process.
[24:13.300 --> 24:17.660]  So you don't necessarily need a dedicated mother plant as long as you remember to take
[24:17.660 --> 24:22.800]  a clone or as many clones as you need from your crop before you flower it out.
[24:22.800 --> 24:26.820]  Most of us are topping our plants, cutting the bottoms off anyway, so why not?
[24:26.820 --> 24:30.660]  If you're doing three big plants in the flower room, four big plants in the flower room,
[24:30.660 --> 24:32.580]  you've got four tops.
[24:32.580 --> 24:33.580]  Fucking what is that?
[24:33.580 --> 24:34.940]  Eight bottoms you could take off there.
[24:34.940 --> 24:36.900]  It's going to give you however many what that is.
[24:36.900 --> 24:39.100]  Eight, 16, 24.
[24:39.100 --> 24:40.620]  Some number and multiples of four.
[24:40.620 --> 24:41.860]  As a drummer, I should have followed along.
[24:41.860 --> 24:43.660]  It's probably 12 is probably the number I'm fucking up.
[24:43.660 --> 24:46.900]  And I'm a drummer, so I didn't think of 12.
[24:46.900 --> 24:48.580]  You can get your cuts off of those plants.
[24:48.580 --> 24:51.980]  The amount of plants you're about to flower is the amount of cuts you need probably, right?
[24:51.980 --> 24:53.220]  If you're keeping a cycle going.
[24:53.220 --> 24:54.660]  So you got three big plants.
[24:54.660 --> 24:56.880]  Take three big clones and do it all over again.
[24:56.880 --> 24:58.460]  You don't need a dedicated mother.
[24:58.460 --> 25:02.220]  I hope I made that clear because I talked about it for a really long time.
[25:02.220 --> 25:03.260]  Veg the plant.
[25:03.260 --> 25:04.540]  Cut a clone.
[25:04.540 --> 25:05.540]  Reveg that plant.
[25:05.540 --> 25:08.220]  While that one's vegging, throw the other one into flower.
[25:08.220 --> 25:10.620]  As soon as that one's ready, cut more clones from it.
[25:10.620 --> 25:11.860]  Throw it into flower.
[25:11.860 --> 25:12.860]  You got clones.
[25:12.860 --> 25:13.860]  They're right there.
[25:13.860 --> 25:17.900]  As long as your clone tech is solid or as long as you wait until you can get that clone
[25:17.900 --> 25:21.300]  into a pot and get it grown big enough to where you're secure that you've got it.
[25:21.300 --> 25:24.300]  If you've got two or three copies, you know you've got it there.
[25:24.300 --> 25:25.300]  Then throw it into flower.
[25:25.300 --> 25:28.900]  And if all else fails, we can reveg the one that's in the flower room.
[25:28.900 --> 25:30.540]  We can take a cut from that one.
[25:30.540 --> 25:32.180]  So that is an easy way to keep the mother plants.
[25:32.180 --> 25:34.420]  You don't have to keep a dedicated mother plant.
[25:34.420 --> 25:37.900]  God, I went on for way too long about that.
[25:37.900 --> 25:38.900]  Rotate your moms occasionally.
[25:38.900 --> 25:44.020]  If you're not going to do the rotational move like I just talked about, refresh, renew,
[25:44.020 --> 25:45.660]  and rotate your mother plants occasionally.
[25:45.660 --> 25:50.020]  I said I do it about every six months, once a year, depending on the genetics, the situation,
[25:50.020 --> 25:51.560]  the size of the room.
[25:51.560 --> 25:52.900]  Sometimes that goes more quickly.
[25:52.900 --> 25:53.900]  Sometimes it takes longer.
[25:53.900 --> 25:59.500]  In a commercial grow, I may do it sooner because the plants grow so largely under all of those
[25:59.500 --> 26:00.500]  lights.
[26:00.500 --> 26:02.780]  Now, here's something people are going to talk about.
[26:02.780 --> 26:07.180]  The word you're going to try to spit out, throw at me, use for controversy, type in
[26:07.180 --> 26:08.980]  the comments, is the word genetic drift.
[26:08.980 --> 26:11.980]  And right now I'm going to go, wrong, nope.
[26:11.980 --> 26:14.940]  Genetic drift is not possible in this situation.
[26:14.940 --> 26:17.780]  If you listen to the full episode, I did call it genetic drift.
[26:17.780 --> 26:20.720]  That will explain why this is not genetic drift.
[26:20.720 --> 26:25.580]  If you do notice that your plants are getting weaker over time, genetic drift is not the
[26:25.580 --> 26:26.780]  cause of this.
[26:26.780 --> 26:31.780]  If you keep a healthy mother plant and you take healthy clones in a clean environment
[26:31.780 --> 26:35.660]  and you grow those clones properly and love them and take care of them and feed them and
[26:35.660 --> 26:41.420]  don't let them get any pathogens or problems, you can perpetually keep those plants forever.
[26:41.420 --> 26:44.820]  You will not face any problems if you keep them clean.
[26:44.820 --> 26:48.200]  Don't let them get any viruses, any pathogens, no bugs.
[26:48.200 --> 26:51.060]  Everything like that will degrade the quality of your plants.
[26:51.060 --> 26:55.540]  That will give you weaker plants, less strength, less vigor.
[26:55.540 --> 26:57.260]  You'll start seeing changes.
[26:57.260 --> 26:59.660]  Also different environments will give you different changes.
[26:59.660 --> 27:04.540]  So if you think that the plant is changing, your clone tech or the environment possibly
[27:04.540 --> 27:05.900]  are changing from that plant.
[27:05.900 --> 27:10.640]  Maybe your humidity, your warmth, anything could change will give the plant a little
[27:10.640 --> 27:11.780]  bit different expression.
[27:11.780 --> 27:15.260]  I noticed that my winter crops and my summer crops are different in the same room with
[27:15.260 --> 27:20.060]  the same cuts, just basically because of the environmental factors I cannot control, can't
[27:20.060 --> 27:23.020]  dial in because of the extremes we face here in Colorado.
[27:23.020 --> 27:27.940]  We get negative 17 in the winter and fucking 117 in the summer.
[27:27.940 --> 27:29.340]  So I've got a lot to work with.
[27:29.340 --> 27:30.980]  I see a lot of different conditions.
[27:30.980 --> 27:32.900]  It's my responsibility to dial them in.
[27:32.900 --> 27:36.860]  I get as close as I can, trust me, but it's a lot to work with sometimes.
[27:36.860 --> 27:39.120]  However, genetic drift is not the word.
[27:39.120 --> 27:45.140]  You may see problems, some degradation, but in my opinion, in my experience, healthy plants
[27:45.140 --> 27:47.620]  make healthy clones for generations.
[27:47.620 --> 27:52.860]  I told you I kept that flow clone around for at least 10 years when I decided to get rid
[27:52.900 --> 27:53.900]  of it.
[27:53.900 --> 27:56.620]  It was just as beautiful and healthy as the day I got it.
[27:56.620 --> 27:59.980]  I cut a bunch of clones of it when I was done with it and I spread those clones out to my
[27:59.980 --> 28:00.980]  friends.
[28:00.980 --> 28:02.300]  I felt that was the polite thing to do.
[28:02.300 --> 28:04.220]  I was like, hey, you guys love flow.
[28:04.220 --> 28:05.380]  I've been growing her for years.
[28:05.380 --> 28:06.380]  I'm done with her.
[28:06.380 --> 28:10.140]  Instead of just taking her out back and shooting her, maybe I'll give you guys a bunch of cuts
[28:10.140 --> 28:11.400]  and you can let it live on.
[28:11.400 --> 28:12.940]  Just don't let me fucking smell it, smoke it.
[28:12.940 --> 28:15.100]  I don't want to be around it anymore.
[28:15.100 --> 28:16.340]  Nothing wrong with that plant, you guys.
[28:16.340 --> 28:17.340]  I'm just done with it.
[28:17.340 --> 28:19.100]  I've smelled so much flow.
[28:19.100 --> 28:23.100]  I grew so much flow, smoked so much flow that I'm done.
[28:23.100 --> 28:24.860]  I don't want to smell it, taste it, look at it.
[28:24.860 --> 28:27.340]  I woke up every morning smelling flow.
[28:27.340 --> 28:30.380]  Then I would go to the dispensary at which I worked and we sold flow.
[28:30.380 --> 28:31.380]  And guess what?
[28:31.380 --> 28:33.500]  Just smell, sell, smoke more flow.
[28:33.500 --> 28:34.500]  I got sick of it.
[28:34.500 --> 28:36.380]  Shout out to flow from Progressive.
[28:36.380 --> 28:37.380]  Nothing but love.
[28:37.380 --> 28:41.020]  Also, big shout out to DJ Short and everybody involved in that flow story.
[28:41.020 --> 28:42.380]  You guys know where the flow came from.
[28:42.380 --> 28:43.380]  If you know, you know.
[28:43.380 --> 28:44.380]  Big up and thank you.
[28:44.380 --> 28:45.380]  Much respect.
[28:45.380 --> 28:46.380]  All right.
[28:46.420 --> 28:47.420]  So, I don't think you need clones.
[28:47.420 --> 28:48.780]  I don't think genetic drift is a thing.
[28:48.780 --> 28:50.820]  It's definitely not a thing when we're cloning plants.
[28:50.820 --> 28:51.820]  Do some research.
[28:51.820 --> 28:54.340]  I've already explained why in a full episode.
[28:54.340 --> 28:55.560]  All right.
[28:55.560 --> 28:56.700]  My friend used to be cool.
[28:56.700 --> 28:59.860]  I think I've rambled on for long enough about mother plants.
[28:59.860 --> 29:01.420]  Feed them veg nutrients.
[29:01.420 --> 29:02.660]  Give them lots of veg light.
[29:02.660 --> 29:05.700]  Keep them in a big enough pot to where they don't get root bound because they will get
[29:05.700 --> 29:09.660]  root bound and they may give you some problems there.
[29:09.660 --> 29:13.300]  Shape them the way you need them to give you the amount of clones as frequently as you
[29:13.300 --> 29:14.300]  need.
[29:14.300 --> 29:15.500]  Rotate them out.
[29:15.620 --> 29:17.580]  You don't need a keeper mom all the time.
[29:17.580 --> 29:22.040]  As long as you've got a veg plant of that mom, you have got the genetics stored.
[29:22.040 --> 29:23.080]  Cut a clone of it.
[29:23.080 --> 29:24.260]  Get that clone rooted.
[29:24.260 --> 29:25.780]  Put that big plant into flower.
[29:25.780 --> 29:28.180]  Perpetually keep that bad bitch around.
[29:28.180 --> 29:29.180]  That's how you can do it.
[29:29.180 --> 29:30.180]  All right.
[29:30.180 --> 29:33.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[29:33.780 --> 29:37.340]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I want to
[29:37.340 --> 29:41.260]  thank you once again for watching and listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[29:41.260 --> 29:42.260]  podcast.
[29:42.260 --> 29:43.980]  I did have a good time recording this one.
[29:43.980 --> 29:45.260]  Felt super comfortable tonight.
[29:46.020 --> 29:49.100]  Sometimes this microphone just sounds so good in the headphones.
[29:49.100 --> 29:50.100]  Sometimes it doesn't.
[29:50.100 --> 29:51.860]  Let's hope it edits as well as it recorded.
[29:51.860 --> 29:54.700]  Big shout out to this camera for holding on.
[29:54.700 --> 29:56.940]  Camera number two could kiss my ass.
[29:56.940 --> 29:58.140]  We'll talk about that later.
[29:58.140 --> 29:59.740]  Anyway, let's wrap it all up.

[30:30.020 --> 30:32.720]  Keep in mind, it is just me answering the emails.
[30:32.720 --> 30:37.440]  Don't get frustrated or discouraged if I haven't answered or replied or read your message here
[30:37.440 --> 30:38.800]  on the show immediately.

[30:42.820 --> 30:45.720]  Your question may be coming up, so don't get annoyed with me.
[30:45.720 --> 30:48.420]  Also, it's just me answering thousands of emails.
