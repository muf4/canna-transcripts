[01:22.470 --> 01:26.670]  in the garden with your hands full. That link will be there when you're done. All right,
[01:26.670 --> 01:31.590]  ladies and gentlemen, welcome to another podcast. We're in a weird transitional time here in
[01:31.590 --> 01:37.590]  Colorado. The weather is changing from extremely fucking cold to super nice. And then I think
[01:37.590 --> 01:42.030]  this weekend it is supposed to go back to extremely fucking cold. So welcome to spring
[01:42.030 --> 01:46.950]  winter spring somewhere in the middle of that shit. This is a really challenging time for
[01:46.950 --> 01:51.390]  growers when the weather changes like this. This is when we see powdery mildew issues.
[01:51.390 --> 01:55.470]  This is when we see VPD problems in the grow. So good luck. I'm wishing you the best of
[01:55.470 --> 02:00.430]  luck. I hope you do not get any powdery mildew in your indoor grow with all these weird changes.
[02:00.430 --> 02:03.190]  If you're in Colorado, if you're somewhere in the Midwest, you know what I'm talking
[02:03.190 --> 02:08.910]  about right now. It was negative 17 degrees a couple of weeks ago, it got up to 74 degrees
[02:08.910 --> 02:12.950]  a couple of days ago, then this weekend, we're supposed to get dumped on with snow that makes
[02:12.950 --> 02:16.510]  growing really challenging. How do you set up your gear? Do you set up the air conditioner?
[02:16.510 --> 02:20.510]  Do you set up the heater? What do you do? It's hard to get things going in that sort
[02:20.510 --> 02:24.510]  of environment. So I do feel for you and I wish you the best of luck. Pay attention
[02:24.510 --> 02:28.070]  to your monitors. If you're using the minder unit, the pulse grow, whatever you've got
[02:28.070 --> 02:32.150]  in there telling you what's going on. Stay on top of that. Check out your nighttime humidity
[02:32.150 --> 02:35.630]  and temperatures because when the sun goes down and that snow is out there, shit gets
[02:35.630 --> 02:39.870]  really cold. It's time to pay really close attention to all of that stuff. Also, speaking
[02:39.870 --> 02:45.190]  of springtime, don't forget that it's almost time to get your outdoor garden prepared.
[02:45.190 --> 02:48.910]  It is March. It is almost time to put the plants outside. I know that sounds crazy.
[02:48.910 --> 02:53.070]  We've got months to go, but we want to find good plants to put outside. Do you have your
[02:53.070 --> 02:56.390]  seeds? Do you have your clones? Do you have your nutrients? Do you have a plan? Do you
[02:56.390 --> 03:00.030]  have your space? Are you prepping your babies? Are you prepping your environment? Are you
[03:00.030 --> 03:04.150]  prepping your outdoor grow here in March? It is the middle of March. By the time this
[03:04.150 --> 03:09.070]  episode comes out, you need to start getting ready for your outdoor grow. Have you sprouted
[03:09.070 --> 03:13.270]  your seeds? Have you popped your clones? Have you sexed your plants? I've done an episode
[03:13.270 --> 03:17.350]  on people putting big ass plants outside and finding out halfway through the season. They've
[03:17.350 --> 03:21.990]  got males. Have you done some sex testing to find out that your outdoor plants are females?
[03:21.990 --> 03:25.790]  Let's get ready for outdoor season. I will do my best to get Jesse or another outdoor
[03:25.790 --> 03:30.070]  expert on the show to guide us through the outdoor season so we can set ourselves up
[03:30.070 --> 03:36.390]  for success in 2021. But to be successful, we must start now. So get your seeds, get
[03:36.390 --> 03:39.870]  your clones, get your outdoor environment planned, started, ready. Start thinking about
[03:39.870 --> 03:44.590]  that shit before it is way too late. All right, welcome to spring, winter, springtime, you
[03:44.590 --> 03:48.750]  guys. Let's jump into the main topics of this podcast. I do have three wonderful emails
[03:48.750 --> 03:52.430]  that I would like to address. The first one goes a little bit like this. I didn't write
[03:52.430 --> 03:58.430]  down the full email. It was kind of a conversation between another friend and he said, I am 10
[03:58.430 --> 04:04.110]  days from week eight. And that made me think, bro, you are in week six, settle the fuck
[04:04.110 --> 04:09.990]  down. So the thing I wanted to talk about was when a plant, when a seed package says
[04:09.990 --> 04:14.430]  that those seeds will be done in eight weeks, it doesn't mean when the clock turns to eight
[04:14.470 --> 04:19.430]  weeks, your plants should be done. You've got to finish out that eighth week. So be
[04:19.430 --> 04:23.470]  patient. Let those finish. That is not the first day of week eight when your plants are
[04:23.470 --> 04:28.950]  done. When my buddy said, I am 10 days away from week eight and I'll get to cut down in
[04:28.950 --> 04:33.790]  about 10 or 12 days. I thought, bro, that is week. The end of week seven is where you
[04:33.790 --> 04:38.510]  are. Your people are getting really overzealous. Maybe the word here, they're not giving the
[04:38.510 --> 04:44.270]  plants the time. So when it says eight weeks, those plants need eight full weeks of flowering
[04:44.270 --> 04:48.510]  time. And I'm going to repeat this. I say this quite often on the podcast. Day one of
[04:48.510 --> 04:54.430]  the flowering cycle is when you change the timer to 1212. If you are running photo period
[04:54.430 --> 04:58.190]  plants, if you're running auto flowers, do your thing. That's none of my business. I
[04:58.190 --> 05:03.190]  don't know about autos. I stay away from those. I like photo period plants. If you are running
[05:03.190 --> 05:09.310]  photo period plants in your garden, day one of flower is when you turn that light cycle
[05:09.310 --> 05:14.270]  to 12 hours on and 12 hours off, or maybe it's 1113, but you get the point. The day
[05:14.270 --> 05:19.310]  you make the flip is when the plants are now in flower. Not when you start seeing pre-flower,
[05:19.310 --> 05:25.390]  not when the fucking cow jumps over the moon, not when the fat lady sings the day you flip.
[05:25.390 --> 05:30.750]  That is the day plants have gone into flower. Why would we have a schedule and a calendar
[05:30.750 --> 05:34.230]  that we can mark day one is right now, but then let's just wait a few days until the
[05:34.230 --> 05:39.130]  plants give us a hint or until some other random shit happens. That's not how it goes
[05:39.150 --> 05:44.250]  as a seed breeder, as the person determining how long it takes the plants to flower and
[05:44.250 --> 05:49.810]  marking that on the package. I can tell you I am doing it by the day we flip. So if you're
[05:49.810 --> 05:52.570]  trying to convince somebody otherwise, if you're trying to go buy something else, you
[05:52.570 --> 05:58.070]  were not doing industry standard. Industry standard is flowering starts the day we flip
[05:58.070 --> 06:03.290]  the plants to 1212. So if the package says eight weeks, they need to go eight full weeks,
[06:03.290 --> 06:06.770]  not seven weeks. And at the start of eight week, we cut them down. They need to finish
[06:06.770 --> 06:12.890]  that eighth week. And honestly, be more patient. If, if your plants are going to be done at
[06:12.890 --> 06:17.530]  week eight on the package, let them go to week nine. Maybe let them go to week 10. The
[06:17.530 --> 06:21.610]  rule of thumb is when you think it's ready, let it go another week. Those plants, if it's
[06:21.610 --> 06:25.710]  the first time you're growing it, those plants may show you something new. This is going
[06:25.710 --> 06:29.530]  to be involved in the next question that I ask. Also, if you let those plants go that
[06:29.530 --> 06:34.010]  last extra week, maybe two weeks, you may see things you would have never seen in that
[06:34.010 --> 06:38.410]  plant. Maybe at the last 10 days, it turns amazing colors. Maybe in the last five days,
[06:38.410 --> 06:42.370]  it really beefs up. Maybe in that last week or two, it really puts on amazing amounts
[06:42.370 --> 06:47.050]  of trichomes and potency. Maybe the flavor changes completely from grapefruits to orange
[06:47.050 --> 06:52.150]  rinds in the last week. Maybe you just got to let it go and see what it does. So, um,
[06:52.150 --> 06:55.910]  let it go that full eight weeks. When we write eight weeks on the package, we mean eight
[06:55.910 --> 07:00.530]  weeks from the day you put it into flower. We do not mean that you can harvest on the
[07:00.530 --> 07:04.530]  first day of the eighth week. You've got to finish that eighth week. So you got to
[07:04.530 --> 07:09.490]  cut down the first day of the ninth week. And then another piece of advice is wait longer.
[07:09.490 --> 07:13.250]  If you think it's ready, wait another week. If the seed pack said eight weeks, give it
[07:13.250 --> 07:17.810]  nine, maybe give it 10 because you're not going to degrade that product too much by
[07:17.810 --> 07:22.290]  letting it go a little bit longer, but you can really miss opportunities by not going
[07:22.290 --> 07:27.490]  long enough. So that is my rant on eight weeks. I'm glad I had that conversation with my bro.
[07:27.490 --> 07:31.970]  Know who you are, uh, kind of mixed in a couple of details in there from a couple of conversations.
[07:31.970 --> 07:35.650]  Hope I answered a couple of questions for people. Hope I solve some problems. Again,
[07:35.650 --> 07:41.010]  I'm going to recap that when I say eight weeks of flower, I mean eight weeks from the day you
[07:41.010 --> 07:47.810]  turn the lights to 1212. I also mean a full eight weeks. Is that 56 days? Yes. I want you to get 56
[07:47.810 --> 07:53.090]  full days of flower in there, not 49. I don't want you to cut it down at the start of week eight. I
[07:53.090 --> 07:57.410]  want you to harvest at the end of week eight. Then I'm going to say you could do it with my
[07:57.410 --> 08:01.890]  seeds as well. If my seed pack says it's done in eight weeks, give it nine, give it 10 and see what
[08:01.890 --> 08:06.210]  happens. Take notes that way. The next time you grow it, you can do it even better. The first
[08:06.210 --> 08:10.050]  time you grow it, uh, you're not going to need to get it perfect. We're going to talk about that
[08:10.050 --> 08:16.370]  here in this second question. This one came from our friend. They want their name said, uh, they
[08:16.370 --> 08:20.530]  do not have their name listed here on the email, but this one comes from a listener and it says a
[08:20.530 --> 08:25.170]  lot like this. Do you have an episode on when to flush? You know, I have done an episode on
[08:25.170 --> 08:28.770]  flushing. I can't recall the number right now. I'll drop the number right about here on the
[08:28.770 --> 08:33.650]  screen. I'll also put a link in the show notes and you can link right to the flushing episode.
[08:34.290 --> 08:39.090]  Excuse me for stepping over my new tongue. Um, I do not, I do have a flushing episode.
[08:39.090 --> 08:42.530]  I do not remember the number. I'll put the link in the video description, but it says
[08:42.530 --> 08:48.690]  I know how to flush, but how can I tell when to start flushing? If a seed pack says 60 days,
[08:48.690 --> 08:53.810]  should I just start a week or so before then hope it's done around 60 days? This is a great
[08:53.810 --> 08:58.770]  question. Uh, he says he knows how to flush, but I'm going to cover really briefly on how to flush.
[08:58.770 --> 09:02.770]  It's a really easy method. It's a really easy technique. Before I get there, let me cover one
[09:02.770 --> 09:07.250]  thing that I know a lot of people are going to start saying. Flushing is bro science. Flushing
[09:07.250 --> 09:11.970]  is pseudoscience. Flushing is not necessary. There is a lot of controversy in the cannabis
[09:11.970 --> 09:17.170]  environment right now talking about flushing. There's a very popular, famous author who went
[09:17.170 --> 09:21.010]  out and said that flushing is highly unnecessary, that we don't need to do it. There are a lot of
[09:21.010 --> 09:25.970]  other people that say we should be flushing our plants. I am not a scientist. I have not gone to
[09:25.970 --> 09:31.010]  school for that sort of stuff. I can't give you a definitive scientific answer. I can give you the
[09:31.010 --> 09:37.490]  Rasta Jeff bro science opinion. Get ready for it. Um, my email box is open. I'm waiting to hear back
[09:37.490 --> 09:43.250]  from you. Here is my opinion on flushing. When we're using a super soil type of medium and
[09:43.250 --> 09:47.970]  organic environment, flushing may not be as necessary as when we are feeding our plants
[09:47.970 --> 09:54.290]  chelated and buffered nutrients. Um, I feel like the plants can kind of selectively take up nutrients
[09:54.290 --> 09:58.050]  when they're in that organics, but I feel like they're kind of being force-fed more stuff,
[09:58.050 --> 10:03.170]  uh, more nutrients, uh, when we give them the chelated nutrients. So there may be some things
[10:03.170 --> 10:08.930]  we can possibly flush out of the chelated and buffered plants. Uh, there may be more necessary
[10:08.930 --> 10:14.930]  to do that. Then something inside of me says, what are we trying to flush? Like what are we
[10:14.930 --> 10:20.050]  actually flushing out? We're flushing out. The main point of flushing is to clean the root zone,
[10:20.050 --> 10:25.490]  the rhizosphere to remove all of the nutrients, the minerals, the feeding, the food from that
[10:25.490 --> 10:30.370]  root zone. So that our plant will basically cannibalize itself. And our theory is that
[10:30.370 --> 10:34.530]  without those nutrients in the root zone, the nutrients will not be in the plant. And then
[10:34.530 --> 10:40.770]  the plant should therefore burn better, smoke better, taste better, and be a better overall
[10:40.770 --> 10:47.010]  product. Once it's dried and cured and ready for consumption. Part of me likes that. I know I've
[10:47.010 --> 10:50.450]  been feeding these plants for nine weeks. I've been stuffing a bunch of shit into there and
[10:50.450 --> 10:57.650]  making them get big and beefy, but hasn't all of that stuff metabolized and turned into bud matter
[10:57.650 --> 11:03.090]  and leaf matter. And it is now part of the plants. It hasn't, those are the small building blocks
[11:03.090 --> 11:10.210]  that have been metabolized and turned into flowers, leaves, stems, trichomes, essential oils,
[11:10.210 --> 11:14.450]  all of the things that are in that plant have been kind of metabolized and converted.
[11:14.450 --> 11:20.450]  So I don't think, I don't know that we can actually flush out a lot of that stuff. I don't have the
[11:20.450 --> 11:25.890]  right equipment, the education to actually know what we're flushing out. If we are flushing anything
[11:25.890 --> 11:31.570]  out, I don't know a hundred percent that it is necessary. I do know that we had a crop that was
[11:31.570 --> 11:36.130]  ran of concentrates that some of the plants never got flushed. We didn't realize that the harvest
[11:36.130 --> 11:40.690]  time was coming. There was an issue. Plants got harvested. They got turned into concentrates.
[11:40.690 --> 11:45.410]  We had no hint that there were nutrients, bad flavors, bad aromas in that concentrate. The
[11:45.410 --> 11:50.930]  concentrate was fucking tremendous, but I haven't done the side-by-side with just cutting down a
[11:50.930 --> 11:55.170]  crop without flushing it and cutting down a crop that has been flushed, drying and curing them
[11:55.170 --> 12:00.530]  side-by-side and smoking them. I personally have not done that test. I am in the habit of flushing.
[12:01.250 --> 12:06.450]  So now that is kind of my rant on the pseudoscience, the question, the controversy of
[12:06.450 --> 12:13.970]  flushing. I don't know that it is necessary. I like to do it. I grow with salt-based nutrients.
[12:13.970 --> 12:19.250]  I find it advantageous to flush because I think I may be cleaning something out. But then I ask
[12:19.250 --> 12:23.890]  myself the question, what could I possibly be cleaning out? Those things have become
[12:23.890 --> 12:28.450]  plant. They're buds now. I'm not going to wash out calcium out of the buds. There's not,
[12:29.330 --> 12:33.810]  I didn't pour the bottle of CalMag into the bud. The CalMag went into the solution,
[12:33.810 --> 12:37.650]  which went into the roots, which got converted, metabolized, turned into plants through
[12:37.650 --> 12:44.290]  photosynthesis. I don't know that I can flush that CalMag out. So I don't know. That's the
[12:44.290 --> 12:49.650]  pseudoscience. Now let's talk about how to flush. Flushing is free. That's why I'm in the habit of
[12:49.650 --> 12:55.250]  flushing. I've been taught to flush for the last 10 to 14 days of my flowering cycle. I really
[12:55.250 --> 13:00.370]  liked it because it's free. It's a really easy task to do. And if it does improve our gardens,
[13:00.370 --> 13:04.850]  I felt that it was something that was so easy to do. I should do it just in case it did work.
[13:05.650 --> 13:11.090]  I may be missing the opportunity to give my plants one, two, maybe three more feedings over that 10
[13:11.090 --> 13:16.930]  to 14 days, but how much more feeding can I give them? What more performance am I going to get
[13:16.930 --> 13:22.370]  with one or two more feeds in that last 10 or 14 days? So flushing is free. The way that I flush,
[13:22.370 --> 13:28.690]  the way that I recommend to flush is to simply water your plants as normal. So if the last eight
[13:28.690 --> 13:32.370]  weeks of your plants, you've been watering and getting 20% runoff, but you've been adding
[13:32.370 --> 13:39.090]  nutrients. When you begin to flush, what I would do is water to 20% runoff, but I simply do not
[13:39.090 --> 13:43.570]  add nutrients. It's that easy. If you pour a gallon of nutrient and water through your plant
[13:43.570 --> 13:47.890]  on a watering day, when it comes time to flush, pour a gallon through there and don't add any
[13:47.890 --> 13:53.090]  nutrients. You are now flushing. The water is going to run off the excess nutrients in your
[13:53.810 --> 13:57.490]  soil and your cocoa. That's all going to run out of the bottom. That'll be in your runoff test.
[13:57.490 --> 14:01.730]  It's in your runoff water. That's not in the rhizosphere anymore. You are now technically,
[14:01.730 --> 14:08.130]  you are flushing. Now, don't think that you need to completely drain and flood your pot every time
[14:08.130 --> 14:13.650]  you flush. Just a little bit of runoff every time is sufficient. We're going to do this for 10, 14
[14:13.650 --> 14:18.210]  days. So you're probably going to get two, three, maybe four or five waterings, depending on your
[14:18.210 --> 14:22.690]  cycles, your pot sizes, uh, the room. So you're going to get a couple of waterings to just rinse
[14:22.690 --> 14:27.170]  them out. We just don't want to give them nutrients. So just water them until you get 10 to
[14:27.170 --> 14:35.170]  20% runoff and do it every day until harvest. Then I actually don't do a flush or a water about three
[14:35.170 --> 14:39.650]  days before harvest. This kind of speeds them up and lets them get drying a little bit. If you need
[14:39.650 --> 14:43.730]  them to stay wet longer, cause you're in a dry environment, water them right before you cut them
[14:43.730 --> 14:48.130]  down. Think about that. If you water them right before you cut them, they're going to be a little
[14:48.130 --> 14:52.690]  bit more wet in your drying cure area. If you let them dry on the sticks, they're going to be a
[14:52.690 --> 14:59.090]  little bit drier in your dry and cure area. So I flush for about 14 days with just plain water.
[14:59.090 --> 15:04.290]  Sometimes I will add some enzymes in there. Maybe sometimes I'll add a couple of sweeteners or
[15:04.290 --> 15:09.810]  something, but for the most part, I'm just going to be flushing for the last 10 to 14 days because
[15:09.810 --> 15:14.610]  it is free and it could really improve the quality of my product. Why wouldn't I do something that's
[15:14.610 --> 15:21.010]  fucking free and could improve the quality. Now there is controversy about pH-ing your flush water.
[15:21.010 --> 15:27.170]  I work in a large commercial environment a lot of times, and I think it would be an extra step to pH
[15:27.170 --> 15:33.010]  adjust the 500 gallon reservoir while we are flushing. The reason we pH the water is because
[15:33.010 --> 15:39.250]  plants uptake specific nutrients at specific pH ranges. If the pH range isn't within that area,
[15:39.250 --> 15:44.610]  the plants won't uptake anything. So that assists me in flushing that rhizosphere. I don't worry
[15:44.610 --> 15:49.490]  about flushing or I don't worry about pH when I'm flushing because I don't want the plants to drink.
[15:49.490 --> 15:53.810]  So not having a dialed in pH, they will not drink. That's what I'm going for. And they're going to
[15:53.810 --> 15:57.490]  start to look like shit. You guys were going to yellow them out. They're not getting any food.
[15:57.490 --> 16:00.290]  We're killing them. They're cannibalizing themselves. They're using all the nutrients
[16:00.290 --> 16:04.370]  that have been stored within their leaves. They're feeding themselves with that. Expect them
[16:04.370 --> 16:08.850]  to start looking a little yellow, a little crispy. Don't be afraid to pull off those excess leaves.
[16:08.850 --> 16:15.970]  Get that stuff out of there. So that is how, when, and why I flush. Now this one says, how do I know
[16:15.970 --> 16:21.250]  when to flush? If a seed pack says 60 days, do I start a week before and then just hope it's done
[16:21.250 --> 16:29.490]  around 60 days? If the seed pack says 60 days, I would go 70. Like I said, in my previous rant,
[16:30.050 --> 16:34.530]  you don't know what phenotype you've got. The breeder doesn't know what may be going on in
[16:34.530 --> 16:39.650]  your environment with your nutrients. You may have a phenotype that wants to go a few extra days.
[16:39.650 --> 16:44.050]  Let it go that few extra days and see, maybe it'll do something amazing. You'll never know if you
[16:44.050 --> 16:49.490]  don't let it go. So if it says 60 days on the package, my recommendation is to let it go 70
[16:49.490 --> 16:55.090]  days, at least 67 days. Let it go that extra week. I know that sounds crazy because you're a grower
[16:55.090 --> 16:59.730]  that wants to get that crop down. You want to get it harvested, dried, cured, so you can either
[16:59.730 --> 17:06.130]  smoke it or make your profit off of it. But that extra week could really increase your harvest
[17:06.130 --> 17:10.130]  weight, really increase your potency. It could make your product stand out to where you can
[17:10.130 --> 17:14.290]  actually sell it for a little extra more money, or you can smoke it and enjoy it just a little
[17:14.290 --> 17:19.090]  bit better. So give it that extra week to 10 days the first time you grow it, just to see what
[17:19.090 --> 17:24.530]  happens. That is my recommendation. I always go a little bit longer when I have a new strain,
[17:24.530 --> 17:31.730]  just to see what it may do. So if the package says 60 days, my advice, go 67 to 70 days, maybe even
[17:31.730 --> 17:35.970]  longer if you can risk it, if you can push it, if you can hold back, it's you that you got to do.
[17:35.970 --> 17:41.090]  It's patience on your part. You're the one in control of everything. So I would say go 70 days
[17:41.090 --> 17:46.690]  and then begin your flush at day 60. Now, take notes at this time. I don't know if you've got
[17:46.690 --> 17:51.410]  any clones of this. I don't know if you're just running one plant, but run that 70 days and take
[17:51.410 --> 17:56.930]  notes. See what it was like. Start watching the trichomes around day 55, get a loop, check them
[17:56.930 --> 18:05.570]  out at 55, 60, 63, 65, 70, pay really close attention to those trichomes. Then at day 70,
[18:05.570 --> 18:12.450]  cut it down. Something to think about is hopefully this is not your first date with this plant. This
[18:12.450 --> 18:16.130]  is not going to, or not your last date. Sorry, I hear a weird noise. I'm distracted by a weird
[18:16.130 --> 18:18.530]  noise in the background. I don't know what the hell it is. I really hope it's not coming through
[18:18.530 --> 18:23.810]  the microphone. It doesn't sound like it is, but hopefully this is not your last date with this
[18:23.810 --> 18:28.050]  plant. Hopefully this is your first date. So this is your kind of, you're just going out for dinner
[18:28.050 --> 18:32.770]  the first time getting to know her. You got to dial this plant in. You've gone 70 days,
[18:32.770 --> 18:38.450]  take three or four clones, run like four clones next time. Cut one down at day 60, one at day 63,
[18:38.450 --> 18:44.610]  one at day 65, and one at day 70. Dry and cure them all the same. Smoke them. See which one you
[18:44.610 --> 18:51.090]  desire the most. And then in subsequent grows, cut them down at that day. But people think that
[18:51.090 --> 18:55.650]  this first time they grow this plant, they've got to get it perfect. You'll get it right. You'll get
[18:55.650 --> 19:00.610]  it good. But the second, third, fourth time you grow this plant, that's when you really get it
[19:00.610 --> 19:05.570]  dialed in. That's when we really start getting the nuances of that plant. You'll start realizing,
[19:05.570 --> 19:10.930]  oh, it wants to go 64 days. And the last two days it wants it really, really cold.
[19:10.930 --> 19:15.730]  And also around week five, it would have really liked it if I would have added a little bit more
[19:15.730 --> 19:20.450]  calcium and gone a little bit lighter on the phosphorus. You just got to grow them a few
[19:20.450 --> 19:24.930]  times and learn them. It's like taking this plant out on several dates, except your dates
[19:24.930 --> 19:31.570]  are really, really long. They're like 90 day cycles for each date. So hopefully this is not
[19:31.570 --> 19:35.890]  your last run with this plant. It's just your first run. You've got to learn the plant. You're
[19:35.890 --> 19:39.970]  going to learn a lot about it every time you grow it. You're going to see, you're going to have
[19:39.970 --> 19:44.930]  things happen in the grow that tell you what this plant likes. Maybe like right now it's real cold.
[19:45.570 --> 19:49.410]  If I've been running this plant in the summer several times and never gave it the opportunity
[19:49.410 --> 19:54.610]  to get real cold, I just happened to get negative 17. Maybe I'm going to see different things from
[19:54.610 --> 19:59.890]  my plants in my garden because of that negative 17. So run it a few times, learn the plant,
[19:59.890 --> 20:03.970]  see exactly what it likes. Then you'll know I got to get it real cold. I got to give it
[20:04.530 --> 20:09.250]  real high or real low pH, just things like that. You'll learn them with different growth. So dial
[20:09.250 --> 20:15.330]  it in over time. Then the next time you grow it, take multiple cuts of that same plant, treat it
[20:15.330 --> 20:20.930]  all the same all the way through the grow, except flush, harvest, and dry and cure at different times.
[20:20.930 --> 20:24.770]  And then you can really tell the difference in what you're getting from your different
[20:24.770 --> 20:31.650]  flushing, harvesting, drying, and curing intervals. So I know that doesn't sound like the answer you
[20:31.650 --> 20:35.570]  wanted because you didn't want to hear that you should grow to 70 days. You wanted me to say at
[20:35.570 --> 20:41.730]  day 55, flush it, cut it down at 60. But from a grower with a lot of experience, somebody who's
[20:41.730 --> 20:46.690]  really looking to get the most out of my garden, I would run that plant for 70 days and flush it at
[20:46.690 --> 20:52.530]  day 60 and see what you get in the end. Then on your second run, do multiple clones of the same
[20:52.530 --> 20:58.610]  plant, run them at multiple different times, 60, 65, 70, see which one you like the best.
[20:58.610 --> 21:03.410]  Don't worry that you're going to ruin the crop by going a little bit too long. You can start
[21:03.410 --> 21:09.570]  flushing at day 55 if you want to, just to be prepared. And then keep an eye on those trichomes.
[21:09.570 --> 21:14.130]  If you think they're getting too amber, then cut it down. But I don't think you're going to over
[21:14.130 --> 21:19.010]  ripen these plants. There's a nice window of ripeness. You get a few days. It's not like you
[21:19.010 --> 21:25.890]  have to cut them at day 62 or you're going to fuck it up. I run big commercial grows and we can't let
[21:25.890 --> 21:32.690]  one plant dictate the whole room. The room is coming down on March 17th and that's when it
[21:32.690 --> 21:37.330]  comes down. We've got a bunch of plants in there that run nine weeks. We do a nine week cycle.
[21:37.330 --> 21:42.930]  March 17th will be the end of nine weeks. All of those plants are coming down. Some of them, yes,
[21:42.930 --> 21:48.050]  should have probably came down around March 14th. Some of them probably could have come down around
[21:48.050 --> 21:53.810]  the 15th. Some of them need to go till the 21st. But that's such a nice middle ground right there
[21:53.810 --> 21:58.530]  that I think all the plants come out. They're just, they're not amazing. They're not fucking
[21:58.530 --> 22:03.490]  stellar, but they're just right to where all of the plants agree that that nine week mark works
[22:03.490 --> 22:07.650]  for us. So on the commercial grow, they come down at nine weeks. We don't fuck around with that extra
[22:07.650 --> 22:13.010]  two or three days, letting some shit grow, cutting shit early. We just chop them. So we start flushing
[22:13.010 --> 22:17.010]  about 10 days before they're, we're in cocoa. So we only have to flush for about 10 days, put some
[22:17.010 --> 22:22.290]  enzymes in there. It cleans them out real good. Anyway, I'm getting off track. My point, start
[22:22.290 --> 22:27.890]  flushing about 60 days. Take a lot of notes, pay attention to how the plants react, try them, cure
[22:27.890 --> 22:33.250]  them, see how you smoke it, see how you enjoy it. The next time do multiple cultivars, multiple cuts
[22:33.250 --> 22:37.490]  of the same plant, cut them down at different times at different intervals and see which one
[22:37.490 --> 22:44.450]  works best for you or your clientele or customers, whoever is consuming this product, see which one
[22:44.450 --> 22:51.250]  they prefer. All right, I am moving on to the next message. This one comes from a friend who uses the
[22:51.250 --> 22:58.450]  name. Um, actually they sent me another message and said, please don't use my name. So we're going
[22:58.450 --> 23:01.730]  to skip their name. We don't want to say their name in this episode. I'm glad I read that. I'm
[23:01.730 --> 23:06.850]  glad I remember they sent me another message. Anyway, this one says greetings from prohibition
[23:06.850 --> 23:11.570]  land. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, my friend, thank you for the great message and thank
[23:11.570 --> 23:15.490]  you for listening. Uh, and thank you for the passion you've got about cannabis because this
[23:15.490 --> 23:20.850]  is a great message. It goes on and it says, thank you for always providing a great advice
[23:20.850 --> 23:26.770]  and suggestions on each and every podcast you do. I wake and bake every morning with your latest
[23:26.770 --> 23:31.730]  premiere or an episode I have yet to watch. Uh, man, thank you. Good morning, bro. You're probably
[23:31.730 --> 23:36.370]  hanging out, smoking a bowl right now. Good morning, bro. Hope you have a good day. It keeps going. It
[23:36.370 --> 23:42.850]  says, I swear I used the grow room setup episodes as a Bible with great success. I love hearing that.
[23:42.850 --> 23:47.970]  Thank you. Uh, way back in the day, I did some grow room setup episodes. It's around episode 400,
[23:47.970 --> 23:53.570]  I believe 401. We talk about setting up your grow and our friend has had great success. I like
[23:53.570 --> 23:57.890]  hearing that. Thank you. And good job to you. It says my plants are happy. They're thriving and
[23:57.890 --> 24:03.490]  growing like a weed. Ha ha ha. And then he said, fuck, that made me laugh, bro. You need to smoke
[24:03.490 --> 24:08.930]  another bowl. Anyway, it says, this brings me to the email, uh, the point of my email. Here we go.
[24:08.930 --> 24:12.050]  Now we're getting to the point you guys, it says for over two years, I've been growing with another
[24:12.050 --> 24:18.690]  gentleman in his garden. He and we have been very successful in our adventures, but now he is
[24:18.690 --> 24:25.810]  starting to use Eagle 20 and Abba Mectin as a preventative measure. Um, terrible products that
[24:25.810 --> 24:29.890]  would not allow recommend, endorse, condone, or promote the use of those products at all.
[24:29.890 --> 24:35.090]  That's where this message gets good. It says, uh, we've never had a powdery mildew issue and
[24:35.090 --> 24:39.570]  little to no bugs in our garden, but now he is starting to use, but monthly sprays.
[24:40.370 --> 24:44.370]  We have, but we've never had any, uh, powdery mildew and little to no bugs in our garden. So
[24:44.370 --> 24:49.090]  they're starting to use powder Eagle 20, even though they've never had powdery mildew or, uh,
[24:49.090 --> 24:55.170]  any big bug issues. It says monthly sprays, a future death for the consumers. What the fuck?
[24:55.170 --> 25:00.850]  I completely agree with you, bro. Uh, that is not a good product. Um, that's not good morals,
[25:00.850 --> 25:04.370]  good ethics. I'm going to keep reading though. It says, what the fuck? This has made me start
[25:04.370 --> 25:10.770]  my own garden and leave his garden. Um, I hate to say problem solved, but problem solved, man,
[25:10.770 --> 25:15.010]  you can only worry about yourself. You can only do what you can do. He's going to do his thing.
[25:15.010 --> 25:19.090]  If you've separated yourself from him, you know, you're doing the right thing, basically problem
[25:19.090 --> 25:24.610]  solved, but there is more. It says, I know that is bad shit. Real, real bad shit. Yes,
[25:24.610 --> 25:28.530]  it is real bad shit. It's toxic. It's not good for the plants. Not good for the environment.
[25:28.530 --> 25:33.730]  Not good for the applicator, not good for the consumer and honestly not necessary for the
[25:33.730 --> 25:38.290]  cannabis plants. There's much more to this. It says him and I have argued about using these
[25:38.290 --> 25:43.650]  chemicals. I cannot be a part of that. My dilemma is what to do with that knowledge. I don't want to
[25:43.650 --> 25:49.330]  be a rat, but come on, man. Yeah, you can't be a rat. Uh, we're in this game. Uh, this is a
[25:49.330 --> 25:54.050]  fucking game where snitches get stitches. You cannot be a rat no matter what it's about. Snitching
[25:54.050 --> 25:58.450]  is snitching. So you can't be a snitch. You've just got to be the best man that you can be about
[25:58.450 --> 26:02.690]  this situation. And that's what you're doing. You're getting away from a terrible situation.
[26:02.690 --> 26:05.810]  You know, someone's doing wrong. You don't want to be involved in it. So you've separated
[26:05.810 --> 26:10.930]  yourself from it in this type of situation. That's probably the best we can do. There's more though.
[26:10.930 --> 26:15.730]  It says this is free market cannabis. So testing is not required. I'm going to go off on a rant
[26:15.730 --> 26:20.850]  here. It makes me laugh when people say that they prefer black market cannabis because you don't
[26:20.850 --> 26:25.330]  find powdery mildew and you don't find pesticides in black market cannabis. Of course you don't.
[26:25.330 --> 26:29.730]  It wasn't tested. Uh, so how do you even know that there were pesticides or,
[26:30.850 --> 26:34.930]  uh, mold or whatever in your black market cannabis? They say, y'all, that dispensary
[26:34.930 --> 26:39.330]  weed is moldy and doesn't pass testing. Yeah. The black market stuff will too, because
[26:40.050 --> 26:44.130]  it doesn't have to get tested. All right. That's just my, my side rant. We're going to keep going.
[26:44.130 --> 26:49.010]  Let me find where I was. Uh, I think I know where you stand on these cancer causing products,
[26:49.010 --> 26:53.250]  but what would you do with the knowledge of what he is doing? I'm going to talk about that here.
[26:53.250 --> 26:56.930]  It says, sorry for the ridiculous length of the email, but having lost my parents,
[26:56.930 --> 27:00.690]  grandparents and countless others to cancer, I feel pretty strongly about this.
[27:01.250 --> 27:05.490]  Uh, that's a fucking understandable stance right there, bro. I understand that. Thank you again,
[27:05.490 --> 27:11.170]  Ross to Jeff for the grow from your heart podcast without the podcast, my big boy balls would still
[27:11.170 --> 27:16.770]  be in my girl's purse and I wouldn't have dared to expand my own garden. I love that. I'm glad I
[27:16.770 --> 27:21.810]  gave you the knowledge and courage and, uh, just the knowledge and courage, I guess, to get your
[27:21.810 --> 27:26.050]  balls out of the purse and start your own big boy garden. Congratulations, bro. Sounds like you
[27:26.050 --> 27:31.330]  got a cool lady also. Uh, then it says from your friend and then he actually says you can use my
[27:31.330 --> 27:35.490]  real name. Nobody believes in real names anyways. Then he backed that up with, Hey bro, actually,
[27:35.490 --> 27:39.090]  my name's kind of unique. Don't use my real name. So we're not going to use your real name. We'll
[27:39.090 --> 27:42.850]  keep you safe here, bro. Hopefully your ex grow partner doesn't hear this and doesn't get upset
[27:42.850 --> 27:49.010]  with you. Um, you know how I feel about this dude. Uh, Eagle 20 is a terrible product. That's the
[27:49.010 --> 27:55.010]  product that you listed here. Mainly, uh, they got my attention. Eagle 20 is banned in commercial
[27:55.010 --> 27:59.250]  cultivation in the state of Colorado. It is banned by the Colorado department of agriculture for
[27:59.250 --> 28:04.450]  several reasons. First of all, uh, it does not go away. It's on the plants forever. Once you put
[28:04.450 --> 28:09.890]  that on the plants, it stays a second of all, it's very toxic to the applicator and the consumer.
[28:10.450 --> 28:17.090]  Third, uh, if the fire department has to come and the building is on fire, they don't want us having
[28:17.090 --> 28:23.250]  Eagle 20 in the building because when it burns, it turns into cyanide gas, which doesn't sound
[28:23.250 --> 28:29.090]  good to me at all. So, uh, Eagle 20 is a very terrible product. Also, if you have to use Eagle
[28:29.090 --> 28:35.410]  20 in the grow, you're being lazy. You said there are no powdery mildew or bug problems.
[28:35.410 --> 28:40.290]  What the fuck are you using powdery mildew for? If you don't have any bug or mildew problems,
[28:40.290 --> 28:45.490]  uh, this is a lazy man's product. This product is designed for people who don't know how to adjust
[28:45.490 --> 28:49.410]  VPD, who don't know how to do preventative maintenance, who don't know how to set up a
[28:49.410 --> 28:55.650]  grow room and watch a monitor and make sure that your VPD is in range. This is just a lazy man's
[28:55.650 --> 29:02.050]  product. It's also a greedy, careless man's product. Uh, cannabis is meant to make us feel
[29:02.050 --> 29:09.170]  better. And, uh, we rely on our grower, our cultivator to produce a clean, reliable, ethical
[29:09.250 --> 29:15.890]  product. Uh, by being a grower who sprays stuff like Eagle 20 on it, you're not being an ethical
[29:15.890 --> 29:20.610]  grower. You're being a greedy grower who is not thinking about the health or wellbeing of your
[29:20.610 --> 29:26.210]  consumer. And most of the time, cannabis salespeople hang out with the people who consume
[29:26.210 --> 29:29.650]  their products. You come by, you sit on the couch, you play some video games, smoke a couple of
[29:29.650 --> 29:35.170]  bong rips together. You act like your friends, you act like you care about those people. But
[29:35.170 --> 29:39.730]  if you're spraying their medicine, their product with Eagle 20, you don't care about them. You are
[29:39.730 --> 29:43.490]  not their friend. This is supposed to be a medical product. I don't care if you're smoking it
[29:43.490 --> 29:49.090]  recreationally or medically. This is a medical product. It makes our body feel different. It
[29:49.090 --> 29:53.570]  should make you feel better. Spraying Eagle 20 on, on a product you're giving to somebody to
[29:53.570 --> 29:59.810]  prevent cancer is bad karma. It's lazy. It's fucking greedy. You're not thinking about your
[29:59.810 --> 30:03.570]  product. You're not thinking about your friends, your customers, your patient. You were thinking
[30:03.570 --> 30:09.250]  about your wallet and that's a fucked up way to go about cannabis. Yes. I run a cannabis business,
[30:09.250 --> 30:14.050]  but I give you a lot for free. I grow from my heart. I teach you how to succeed with the products
[30:14.050 --> 30:20.690]  that I do offer you. I don't feel that there's a need for laziness, for greed, for a big old ego,
[30:20.690 --> 30:25.250]  for carelessness in the garden. And those are the things that come with applying Eagle 20.
[30:25.250 --> 30:29.410]  That's a big sign that says you don't care about the people. You don't care about the products.
[30:29.410 --> 30:33.010]  And like I said, a moment ago, you don't care about your friends and your community because
[30:33.010 --> 30:37.810]  these people come to your spot and they probably take bong rips with you. You probably hang out at
[30:37.810 --> 30:42.450]  the park with them. They probably know your family and friends. You probably know their family and
[30:42.450 --> 30:47.170]  friends, and then you're going to see them all start coughing. They're going to start feeling
[30:47.170 --> 30:50.770]  weird. They're going to start changing colors. Weird symptoms are going to start popping up
[30:50.770 --> 30:55.570]  because they've been smoking product that is tainted with illegal pesticides, pesticides that
[30:55.570 --> 31:02.450]  I would not even allow in my grow in my home. They're unnecessary. So, um, that's enough of a
[31:02.450 --> 31:09.010]  rant on the terrible morals and shit laziness of your friend who calls themselves a grower.
[31:09.010 --> 31:14.690]  Uh, they are failing and they know it. They're just being greedy. So this is a good sign and a good
[31:14.690 --> 31:19.410]  reason for you to just simply let him go. You can, if you want, I'm not giving you life advice,
[31:19.410 --> 31:25.250]  but I'm giving you life advice. The way somebody does something is the way somebody does everything.
[31:25.250 --> 31:29.730]  And if this guy is spraying bullshit on his plants behind his customers back,
[31:30.370 --> 31:34.290]  what else is he doing to you and your friends, your family, and your customers? What other kind
[31:34.290 --> 31:39.170]  of morals and ethics does this guy have that he's kind of bending when you're not looking?
[31:39.170 --> 31:44.050]  Is this somebody that you want to be friends with? Is that somebody you want on your team? Can you
[31:44.050 --> 31:49.410]  rely on this person as a friend or are they just greedy with you and your friendship in your life
[31:49.410 --> 31:54.930]  also? So he's also doing more filthy shit to his customers and to his friends and to you that you
[31:54.930 --> 31:59.330]  don't know about is my assumption. I can't prove that. I don't know that I don't know the dude,
[31:59.330 --> 32:04.210]  but most of the time, the way somebody does something is the way somebody does everything.
[32:04.210 --> 32:10.530]  And if he's doing this shit greedily, selfishly, lazily, without care, that's how he's probably
[32:10.530 --> 32:14.290]  going to do a lot of things. And that will continue through his life. And that will also
[32:14.290 --> 32:19.970]  spill into your friendship, your relationship and your future. Now, don't let this guy bring you
[32:19.970 --> 32:24.850]  down. Don't attach yourself to him business wise, because once the clientele finds out that he's
[32:24.850 --> 32:28.450]  been spraying shit on it, if you're still attached, they're going to think that you're
[32:28.450 --> 32:36.290]  doing it too. So he will rid himself of his own problem. His clients will realize that something's
[32:36.290 --> 32:42.530]  wrong with the product. Or what will happen is you will get the good clientele. People can tell
[32:42.530 --> 32:46.610]  who's got the good vibes, who's got the good scruples, the good morals, the good ethics,
[32:46.610 --> 32:51.090]  and they can feel that in you and they can feel that in him. And if you guys divide as team
[32:51.650 --> 32:56.210]  members, if you guys divide as salespeople, I don't know your dynamic, but if it is divided
[32:56.210 --> 33:00.690]  and it is kind of, it becomes known amongst your community that it has been divided, people will
[33:00.690 --> 33:04.290]  see that that has happened. People will make their own thought processes and they'll say,
[33:04.290 --> 33:08.130]  you know what? This guy seems like a good guy. He must not be hanging out with this guy over
[33:08.130 --> 33:13.170]  here for a reason. That guy will end up with all of the fucking nefarious customers, all of the
[33:13.170 --> 33:17.490]  riffraff, all the shithead customers will end up over there. You'll have all the good clientele,
[33:17.490 --> 33:21.730]  all the good customers, all the good people that care about each other, that care about karma.
[33:21.730 --> 33:25.330]  He'll have all the shitheads over there. All the people that you kind of needed to distance
[33:25.330 --> 33:31.970]  yourself from anyway, they'll all go there. This may be a blessing in disguise, or as my friend
[33:31.970 --> 33:37.410]  Saul says, could be a blessing in the skies, however you want to say it. But this may be
[33:38.210 --> 33:43.570]  the thing that you needed to separate yourself from some bullshit before you got too deep into
[33:43.570 --> 33:47.970]  some bullshit. Now you can get away, get out of it. You guys can start your own thing. Now you
[33:47.970 --> 33:54.050]  don't have to split the profit with anybody else. Maybe that's the route to take. And you've got the
[33:54.050 --> 33:58.930]  good karma, the good customers. Let him deal with the bad karma, the bad customers. Let that be the
[33:58.930 --> 34:03.010]  way that you deal with it. Don't think about being a snitch. Don't do anything like that.
[34:04.050 --> 34:09.490]  But just ask your friends if they notice, what do you think of my herb compared to his? You notice
[34:09.490 --> 34:13.330]  any taste difference? You could say shit like that to your friends, but don't go stirring the pot.
[34:13.890 --> 34:19.250]  Be careful. Or maybe just get your new customers, your new friends, and just carry on. The best way
[34:19.250 --> 34:23.570]  to succeed and the best way to get revenge is just be fucking happy. Don't even waste your time on
[34:23.570 --> 34:28.130]  that bullshit. Don't look back. Just be you, do your thing. It sounds like you're a good person.
[34:28.130 --> 34:31.410]  It sounds like you've got a good heart. It sounds like you've got the right idea. It sounds like you
[34:31.410 --> 34:36.290]  already knew what to do. You just needed some guidance and some affirmation from me. So there
[34:36.290 --> 34:40.690]  you go, my friend, you're doing the right thing. Things are going to be great for you because
[34:40.690 --> 34:45.970]  you're following the karmic way. You're doing things the Irie way. Thank you. Shout out. Big
[34:45.970 --> 34:50.130]  salute. All right, you guys, I feel like that was enough for this episode. It is time to wrap up
