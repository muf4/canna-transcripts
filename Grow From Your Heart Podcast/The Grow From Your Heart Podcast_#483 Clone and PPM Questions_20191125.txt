[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Alright, here we go.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:02.000 --> 00:06.040]  Welcome to episode 483 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.040 --> 00:09.320]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.320 --> 00:14.120]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:14.120 --> 00:22.560]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.560 --> 00:25.840]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:25.840 --> 00:30.800]  Today I've been taking dabs of Black and Blue Live Batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:30.800 --> 00:34.120]  This is a blend of blue cheese and HSB.
[00:34.120 --> 00:38.800]  On the label, the flavor is described as cream cheese, floral, and blueberry.
[00:38.800 --> 00:41.000]  I will agree with the floral and blueberry.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.440]  I'm not sure I got cream cheese in there.
[00:43.440 --> 00:45.520]  There is definitely a dankness going on.
[00:45.520 --> 00:49.600]  There is a smooth creaminess that I do enjoy, but this is a great concentrate.
[00:49.600 --> 00:51.040]  The flavor is great.
[00:51.040 --> 00:52.500]  The high is perfect.
[00:52.500 --> 00:56.340]  And something about the way that this batter hit my lungs, it really felt like I got a
[00:56.340 --> 00:59.660]  really fat hit off of a little tiny dab.
[00:59.660 --> 01:06.740]  On the back of the package, the label says the product contains 67.2% THC and non-detectable
[01:06.740 --> 01:08.660]  amounts of CBD.
[01:08.660 --> 01:13.540]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Black and Blue Live
[01:13.540 --> 01:15.260]  Batter.
[01:15.260 --> 01:18.140]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a couple of listener emails.
[01:18.140 --> 01:22.140]  Before I get to that part, you know I like to do some shout outs to our friends from
[01:22.140 --> 01:23.140]  Patreon.
[01:23.140 --> 01:26.900]  Let's start off with the big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you
[01:26.900 --> 01:27.900]  to our friend Tommy.
[01:27.900 --> 01:31.620]  I want to send a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast high five and a fist bump to
[01:31.620 --> 01:33.540]  my buddy Glenn Gironi.
[01:33.540 --> 01:35.740]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out to BAFSTA.
[01:35.740 --> 01:39.780]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out, a thank you, and a high
[01:39.780 --> 01:41.860]  five to our new friend Manson.
[01:41.860 --> 01:44.700]  How about a big thank you shout out to our buddy Freak Fish.

[01:48.580 --> 01:50.140]  to our buddy Cliff B.
[01:50.140 --> 01:52.940]  Of course, a giant thank you to Darren W.
[01:52.940 --> 01:56.260]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a thank you to my friend
[01:56.260 --> 01:57.500]  Callie Canopy.
[01:57.500 --> 02:01.180]  I always want to send a big Viking handshake to my friend Grimball the Druid.
[02:01.180 --> 02:05.980]  And last but certainly not least, I'd like to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:05.980 --> 02:08.940]  thank you shout out to my friend Sour D.
[02:08.940 --> 02:13.520]  Big thank you for all of the continued support on the Patreon campaign.
[02:13.520 --> 02:16.680]  If you're not already supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how

[02:24.200 --> 02:29.440]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[02:29.440 --> 02:32.520]  I should also take a moment to give a giant shout out to my new friend Matt.
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.320]  I got to meet Matt today face to face.
[02:34.320 --> 02:38.040]  We got to high five and shake each other's hand, talk about cannabis for a few moments.
[02:38.040 --> 02:39.960]  I really enjoyed the conversation.
[02:39.960 --> 02:42.400]  So big shout out to my new buddy Matt.
[02:42.400 --> 02:46.280]  Alright at the start of the show I did say that I was going to read some listener emails,
[02:46.280 --> 02:50.820]  so let's get into the listener email portion of this episode.
[02:50.820 --> 02:54.180]  The first question in this episode actually came from my YouTube channel.
[02:54.180 --> 02:58.640]  There was a comment left on one of my videos asking about clones and the specific question
[02:58.640 --> 03:04.080]  was why when I see a tray of clones do people often cut the tips of the leaves off of all
[03:04.080 --> 03:05.540]  of their clones?
[03:05.540 --> 03:08.200]  So I'm sure you've seen this in pictures or in other grows.
[03:08.200 --> 03:12.680]  A lot of times when we take a tray of clones or when we fill an EZCloner or an AutoCloner
[03:12.680 --> 03:18.040]  for clones, it is very common practice to cut most of the leaves off of that clone and
[03:18.040 --> 03:22.160]  we also trim the remaining leaves to be quite short.
[03:22.160 --> 03:26.600]  The way I like to do it is I look at the leaf and at the very fattest point, right where
[03:26.600 --> 03:30.880]  it begins to taper back to going skinny, I cut it off right there at the beginning of
[03:30.880 --> 03:32.040]  the taper skinny part.
[03:32.040 --> 03:35.700]  So it gets real wide and as soon as it tapers, I cut it off.
[03:35.700 --> 03:38.260]  We don't need all of that leaf in the dome.
[03:38.260 --> 03:40.780]  We don't need all of that leaf in the cloner.
[03:40.780 --> 03:43.460]  That clone does not need all of that leaf to survive.
[03:43.460 --> 03:47.660]  So let's talk more specifically about why we cut the edges off the clones when we are
[03:47.660 --> 03:49.140]  cutting clones.
[03:49.140 --> 03:54.120]  The main reason is to make it easier for that clone to survive.
[03:54.120 --> 03:58.180]  We just completely removed that clone from its life support system.
[03:58.180 --> 03:59.460]  It does not have roots.
[03:59.460 --> 04:00.540]  It cannot eat.
[04:00.540 --> 04:05.060]  The only way it's able to survive now is by what it gathers through the air, through its
[04:05.420 --> 04:06.420]  leaves.
[04:06.420 --> 04:10.420]  If we have a whole bunch of excessive foliage on there, that is too much for those leaves
[04:10.420 --> 04:11.900]  to try to support themselves.
[04:11.900 --> 04:14.500]  They're used to having a root system to where they can feed.
[04:14.500 --> 04:17.040]  We need to minimize the amount of foliage.
[04:17.040 --> 04:21.980]  We need to basically cut the fat so that plant can survive with the minimal resources that
[04:21.980 --> 04:22.980]  it's got.
[04:22.980 --> 04:27.300]  The little energy it's got left in that cut has to become enough energy to encourage that
[04:27.300 --> 04:30.380]  plant to root out and become a successful clone.
[04:30.380 --> 04:32.340]  So we want to cut the fat basically.
[04:32.340 --> 04:36.900]  We want to minimize the amount of leaf material that that plant is trying to keep alive while
[04:36.900 --> 04:41.660]  keeping enough leaf material there to actually have a viable clone.
[04:41.660 --> 04:46.660]  So the main reason that I cut the tips off many of the leaves is just to make less foliage
[04:46.660 --> 04:47.860]  for that plant to support.
[04:47.860 --> 04:52.780]  We've got a small life support system, less foliage, better chance of success.
[04:52.780 --> 04:57.260]  Another reason why I like to cut the tips off of the clone is it just makes more space
[04:57.260 --> 04:58.260]  in the cloner.
[04:58.260 --> 05:00.380]  That way I don't have leaves overlapping.
[05:00.420 --> 05:05.420]  When leaves start overlapping, you get moisture pockets, you have an uneven VPD in your cloning
[05:05.420 --> 05:08.140]  environment and that can lead to problems.
[05:08.140 --> 05:12.660]  So cutting off those leaf tips gives you less foliage to work with, less for that plant
[05:12.660 --> 05:18.340]  to sustain, and it also gives you a better VPD because the leaves are not resting on
[05:18.340 --> 05:19.340]  top of each other.
[05:19.340 --> 05:22.260]  You don't get weird humidity pockets in some areas.
[05:22.260 --> 05:26.120]  You don't have two leaves stuck together, which always becomes problematic.
[05:26.120 --> 05:29.780]  If two leaves get real humid and then they dry and they're stuck together, the plant's
[05:29.780 --> 05:32.880]  never like that and plants just like space.
[05:32.880 --> 05:36.900]  You don't want somebody's arm resting across you when you're trying to do your job or when
[05:36.900 --> 05:39.860]  you're trying to rest and the plants don't enjoy that sort of thing either.
[05:39.860 --> 05:44.500]  So just give them their space and then that way we can promote a more even VPD throughout
[05:44.500 --> 05:46.260]  the cloning environment.
[05:46.260 --> 05:50.600]  So those are my main reasons why I clip the tips of the leaves of my clones and you will
[05:50.600 --> 05:53.700]  find that this is very strain specific.
[05:53.700 --> 05:59.100]  Some of the thinner leaved cultivars won't respond as well to this as some of the larger,
[05:59.100 --> 06:00.500]  thicker leaved cultivars.
[06:00.500 --> 06:05.260]  All right, so that is my talk on why I clip the leaves of my clones.
[06:05.260 --> 06:09.740]  And again, I will do that if I'm using the EasyCloner or if I'm using the old school
[06:09.740 --> 06:11.740]  Clone Dome method.
[06:11.740 --> 06:15.780]  All right, now let's jump into the actual first email for this episode.
[06:15.780 --> 06:19.600]  If you've got a cannabis cultivation or a cannabis culture question, you can send me
[06:19.600 --> 06:20.600]  an email.
[06:20.600 --> 06:24.060]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[06:24.060 --> 06:26.260]  You know I would love to hear from you.
[06:26.260 --> 06:31.040]  The first official email in today's episode goes a lot like this.
[06:31.040 --> 06:32.040]  It says,
[06:32.040 --> 06:33.040]  Hey there Rasta Jeff.
[06:33.040 --> 06:37.740]  I enjoyed your episode about mistakes, but I didn't reply with mine because until yesterday
[06:37.740 --> 06:43.140]  they were just the usual type, like leaving the door open, minor floods, timer set wrong,
[06:43.140 --> 06:45.940]  and adding molasses to my deep water culture.
[06:45.940 --> 06:49.140]  And then it says in parentheses, overnight death.
[06:49.140 --> 06:52.980]  So this email is in response to an episode I did several episodes back talking about
[06:52.980 --> 06:57.720]  common garden mistakes that I have made, encouraging other people to admit their mistakes.
[06:57.720 --> 07:03.060]  So our friend here who calls themselves Marco Esquindoles admits that they have made several
[07:03.060 --> 07:05.420]  mistakes in the past, but nothing worth talking about.
[07:05.420 --> 07:09.460]  That one where they put molasses in the deep water culture, that is certain death.
[07:09.460 --> 07:11.980]  That will make your deep water culture system all gummy.
[07:11.980 --> 07:14.680]  And by the time you wake up in the morning, your plants are dead.
[07:14.680 --> 07:17.540]  So that is a big mistake, but it sounds like you learned from that.
[07:17.540 --> 07:18.540]  The message goes on.
[07:18.540 --> 07:19.540]  It says,
[07:19.540 --> 07:25.180]  But yesterday I found I had made a mistake so basic I just have to laugh.
[07:25.180 --> 07:29.900]  I was rearranging venting to add an additional blower and charcoal filter, and I discovered
[07:29.900 --> 07:33.700]  that I had installed my main exhaust fan backwards.
[07:33.700 --> 07:38.060]  So this person was going to install more equipment, and they just discovered the original gear
[07:38.060 --> 07:40.640]  is in completely backwards.
[07:40.640 --> 07:44.220]  So instead of pulling the air through the filter, through a sealed light hood, and out
[07:44.220 --> 07:48.860]  of the room, I was pushing outside air into the hood and through the filter.
[07:48.860 --> 07:52.620]  It looks like I won't need that new blower and filter after all.
[07:52.620 --> 07:53.620]  That is pretty funny.
[07:53.620 --> 07:57.340]  Yeah, it's probably going to be easier to cool that room down and keep the temperature
[07:57.340 --> 08:01.380]  right if you are pushing air the direction you thought you were moving the air.
[08:01.380 --> 08:03.020]  That'll make things a lot easier.
[08:03.020 --> 08:06.540]  That's kind of a funny mistake, kind of an expensive mistake.
[08:06.540 --> 08:07.620]  You went and bought more equipment.
[08:07.620 --> 08:09.380]  I hope you can return that.
[08:09.380 --> 08:11.260]  Most grocery stores don't let you take shit back.
[08:11.260 --> 08:14.800]  So you've got a backup for when you need to replace the stuff you've got.
[08:14.800 --> 08:16.420]  But the message goes on to say,
[08:16.420 --> 08:21.420]  I'm embarrassed to admit it took over a month to realize my error.
[08:21.420 --> 08:24.980]  That is embarrassing, but don't feel too bad that it took you over a month to diagnose
[08:24.980 --> 08:26.240]  that problem.
[08:26.240 --> 08:30.700]  Those are the hardest problems to diagnose because we've got different things happening
[08:30.700 --> 08:31.840]  outside all the time.
[08:31.840 --> 08:34.340]  So we think we're just fighting that outside temperature.
[08:34.340 --> 08:35.940]  Like why can't I get my grow room cool?
[08:35.940 --> 08:37.100]  It's so hot out there.
[08:37.100 --> 08:40.380]  And you think you're actually cooling it down, but you were bringing in hot air.
[08:40.380 --> 08:43.020]  So I understand why that could baffle you for a little while.
[08:43.020 --> 08:44.020]  Don't be embarrassed.
[08:44.020 --> 08:45.700]  Be glad that you've got it fixed.
[08:45.700 --> 08:48.660]  It's too bad that you went and spent money on new equipment that you do not need.
[08:48.660 --> 08:50.660]  But like I said before, you've got backup here.
[08:50.660 --> 08:52.480]  You're going to need a new blower.
[08:52.480 --> 08:54.340]  You will need a new filter.
[08:54.340 --> 08:57.980]  You could just throw that in the room to help minimize the aroma on its own, and that would
[08:57.980 --> 08:59.260]  help you out.
[08:59.260 --> 09:00.580]  But don't feel too bad about it.
[09:00.580 --> 09:02.300]  Don't beat yourself up over it.
[09:02.300 --> 09:06.900]  The message goes on and says, as you said, you've got to check the obvious stuff first.
[09:06.900 --> 09:11.300]  Yes, but sometimes the obvious stuff is not the obvious stuff.
[09:11.300 --> 09:14.760]  So sometimes you've just got to struggle for a month and then you've got to laugh at yourself
[09:14.820 --> 09:16.440]  and make that silly face that you make.
[09:16.440 --> 09:20.520]  You've got to slap yourself in the forehead and go, oh, that's my problem.
[09:20.520 --> 09:21.640]  And now you're able to fix it.
[09:21.640 --> 09:22.640]  And now you've learned a lot.
[09:22.640 --> 09:26.280]  And now you've got a good mistake and a good story to tell.
[09:26.280 --> 09:27.280]  The message goes on.
[09:27.280 --> 09:31.880]  It says, on a different subject, I finally got Leonardo to grow some balls.
[09:31.880 --> 09:36.760]  It took a dozen sprays with STS and it's almost too late for the intended crop.
[09:36.760 --> 09:41.200]  But I wanted to make an S2 just for fun and preservation.
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.260]  So our friend Marco Escuindolas here has got my Leonardo strain and they have reversed
[09:46.260 --> 09:48.240]  it using silver thiosulfate.
[09:48.240 --> 09:50.760]  It took longer than expected, which is not a bad thing.
[09:50.760 --> 09:55.240]  That means that that plant has got solid, stable genetics that it is hard to reverse.
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.800]  I took a dozen sprays, which is most of the time it takes seven or eight sprays if you
[09:59.800 --> 10:00.800]  time it properly.
[10:00.800 --> 10:02.560]  So that's a strong strain.
[10:02.560 --> 10:04.500]  It took a lot to reverse that.
[10:04.500 --> 10:05.920]  Almost too late for the intended crop.
[10:05.920 --> 10:08.440]  Yes, timing a reversal is an art.
[10:08.440 --> 10:12.240]  I do have some tips I can share with you in future episodes on that.
[10:12.240 --> 10:15.800]  But maybe you can still sprinkle that pollen and get a few seeds, or maybe you can just
[10:15.800 --> 10:21.800]  save it for the next run because it says, wanted to make an S2 just for fun and preservation.
[10:21.800 --> 10:23.120]  That sounds like a fun project.
[10:23.120 --> 10:27.000]  If you have questions about your feminized breeding project, maybe we can talk about
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.040]  that in a future episode.
[10:29.040 --> 10:31.800]  They wrap up the message with, love the podcast.
[10:31.800 --> 10:33.920]  Feel free to share, including my name.
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.720]  They sign in with Marco Escuandolos, and then they also give us their cannabis name.
[10:38.720 --> 10:40.840]  And on cannabis, they are Nehae.
[10:40.840 --> 10:43.080]  So give them a follow on cannabis.
[10:43.080 --> 10:46.080]  I am familiar with Nehae's great photography.
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.780]  All right, Marco Escuandolos, thank you for the great email.
[10:49.780 --> 10:51.880]  Thank you for admitting your mistakes.
[10:51.880 --> 10:55.840]  If anybody else out there has a grow room mistake they would like to share with us,
[10:55.840 --> 10:57.160]  I would love to hear your story.
[10:57.160 --> 11:00.320]  Again, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[11:01.320 --> 11:04.840]  All right, we're going to keep the show moving with another email.
[11:04.840 --> 11:08.840]  This message comes from our friend Nick, and it goes just like this.
[11:08.840 --> 11:10.720]  Hello, Rasta Jeff.
[11:10.720 --> 11:12.720]  I'm an avid listener of your show.
[11:12.720 --> 11:16.760]  I've invested in a few beans of yours, and I've been happy with the results.
[11:16.760 --> 11:18.160]  That is a great way to start an email.
[11:18.160 --> 11:21.040]  I am glad that my seeds are making you happy.
[11:21.040 --> 11:24.040]  It goes on to say, I've been growing for a while now.
[11:24.040 --> 11:27.120]  However, I never stop learning.
[11:27.120 --> 11:30.100]  That is a great attitude and a great approach.
[11:30.100 --> 11:34.740]  The email goes on to say, growing cannabis for me is about my health and helping a few
[11:34.740 --> 11:36.340]  patients I have.
[11:36.340 --> 11:39.780]  I am very detail-oriented in my grow style.
[11:39.780 --> 11:42.700]  My cannabis has given hope to those that didn't have any.
[11:42.700 --> 11:45.380]  I am so grateful for that.
[11:45.380 --> 11:46.380]  That is a great feeling.
[11:46.380 --> 11:50.260]  That has a lot to do with why I am in the cannabis industry.
[11:50.260 --> 11:56.540]  I was part of the first medical marijuana dispensary in my area, in my city, and I got
[11:56.540 --> 11:58.060]  to help a lot of patients.
[11:58.060 --> 12:02.540]  I got to help little old ladies who were dealing with cancer and major medical problems.
[12:02.540 --> 12:04.620]  I got to help firefighters who were injured.
[12:04.620 --> 12:07.300]  I got to help military veterans who've been blown up.
[12:07.300 --> 12:12.380]  I had a patient who has been in a severe fire and has burned very badly.
[12:12.380 --> 12:15.380]  I got to make his life better on a daily basis.
[12:15.380 --> 12:21.380]  I got to help people of all age ranges and all walks of life on a daily basis with a
[12:21.380 --> 12:26.480]  product that I grew, and then I got to sell to them legally over the counter as a medical
[12:26.480 --> 12:27.900]  marijuana dispensary.
[12:27.900 --> 12:29.620]  That put a huge passion in me.
[12:29.620 --> 12:35.420]  So I absolutely understand and share this gratitude that you have got for cannabis and
[12:35.420 --> 12:37.780]  for what cannabis is doing for your patients.
[12:37.780 --> 12:41.220]  Let me get myself back onto this email because I can ramble about this all day, which is
[12:41.220 --> 12:46.380]  great because it goes on to say, I ramble and yes, a closed head brain injury does show
[12:46.380 --> 12:48.780]  its problems at times.
[12:48.780 --> 12:53.360]  That is funny because I as well have got a head injury and I also ramble.
[12:53.360 --> 12:54.900]  So we are friends already.
[12:54.900 --> 12:57.980]  I also am very detail oriented in my growth style.
[12:57.980 --> 12:58.980]  So we should hang out.
[12:58.980 --> 13:00.500]  We could be friends.
[13:00.500 --> 13:06.260]  The message goes on to say, that being said, I do tend to forget more things than I remember.
[13:06.260 --> 13:10.880]  Cannabis has helped me become a productive member of society in many ways.
[13:10.880 --> 13:14.860]  As a bit of backstory, before my injury, I was a computer engineer.
[13:14.860 --> 13:19.140]  So finding something I can do now is a wondrous thing.
[13:19.140 --> 13:22.940]  I'm glad to hear that you have found cannabis and that you have found that cultivating cannabis
[13:23.340 --> 13:27.380]  gives you a sense of purpose because I'm sure that after a brain injury, being a computer
[13:27.380 --> 13:29.780]  programmer has got to be frustrating.
[13:29.780 --> 13:35.220]  I do agree that once you've got a brain injury, some thought processes and some memories are
[13:35.220 --> 13:36.560]  kind of hindered.
[13:36.560 --> 13:39.940]  I find myself struggling to find certain words sometimes.
[13:39.940 --> 13:44.500]  Sometimes I will know that this bottle in front of me is called water, but I will say,
[13:44.500 --> 13:46.260]  hand me that.
[13:46.260 --> 13:47.540]  Can you pass me that?
[13:47.540 --> 13:51.560]  And I'll just start pointing at it and making faces that I'm thirsty because I can't think
[13:51.560 --> 13:53.120]  of the fucking word water right now.
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.200]  And I know the word water, but just sometimes weird shit like that will just go blank.
[13:57.200 --> 14:01.240]  And I'm sure that that is from smacking the shit out of my head one time.
[14:01.240 --> 14:04.120]  So I'm glad that you have found something that gives you a sense of purpose because
[14:04.120 --> 14:09.200]  not having that sense of purpose after a brain injury can lead down a very dark path.
[14:09.200 --> 14:12.760]  So I'm really glad to hear that you have found cannabis and that you have found gardening
[14:12.760 --> 14:15.020]  to keep yourself positive.
[14:15.020 --> 14:16.240]  There is a question in this message.
[14:16.240 --> 14:20.360]  It says, my question after all that is this.
[14:20.360 --> 14:24.760]  Many nutrient companies have a recommended PPM or EC guide.
[14:24.760 --> 14:29.480]  What I have found is that if you follow the low recommendation dosage along with additives
[14:29.480 --> 14:35.720]  like CalMag and et cetera, the PPMs typically fly off the charts.
[14:35.720 --> 14:39.880]  My water is municipal and reads 0.2 EC out of the tap.
[14:39.880 --> 14:42.140]  My media is Mother's Earth cocoa.
[14:42.140 --> 14:48.820]  To get my PPM within suggested range, I have to lower my base nutrients to below even recommended
[14:48.820 --> 14:50.540]  dosing.
[14:50.540 --> 14:54.980]  For years, I grew without checking my EC or my pH.
[14:54.980 --> 14:59.260]  Now I am attempting to dial it in and I find it frustrating at times.
[14:59.260 --> 15:03.700]  I see other growers dosing and can't even believe they aren't burning their plants.
[15:03.700 --> 15:06.000]  I am talking great growers here.
[15:06.000 --> 15:07.860]  I appreciate your help always.
[15:07.860 --> 15:09.060]  Thank you for your contributions.
[15:09.060 --> 15:11.180]  I look forward to your podcasts.
[15:11.180 --> 15:13.380]  Thank you and take a monster dab for me.
[15:13.380 --> 15:15.020]  You may give out my name bro.
[15:15.020 --> 15:16.020]  No worries.
[15:16.020 --> 15:17.020]  Peace.
[15:17.020 --> 15:18.020]  From.
[15:18.020 --> 15:19.780]  Hey Nick, thank you for the great email.
[15:19.780 --> 15:24.940]  I promise you I will take a gigantic dab for you right after the podcast.
[15:24.940 --> 15:29.440]  So let's talk a little bit about this EC question.
[15:29.440 --> 15:30.620]  This is a very good question.
[15:30.620 --> 15:34.580]  Now when you are buying nutrients, they quite often come with what is known as a nutrient
[15:34.580 --> 15:39.740]  calculator or you can go online and you can type in whatever nutrient brand you have purchased
[15:39.740 --> 15:44.280]  and most of them will have a nutrient calculator on their website.
[15:44.280 --> 15:47.720]  On that calculator, you usually tell it which bottles you have purchased.
[15:47.720 --> 15:52.800]  Like I have got base nudes A, base nudes B. I have got a little microbe product.
[15:52.800 --> 15:55.560]  I probably got cow mag and we probably got a bloom booster.
[15:55.560 --> 15:58.480]  Those are the basic things that most nutrient companies will sell you.
[15:58.480 --> 16:02.160]  So you click on what you have purchased and then you type in how many weeks am I going
[16:02.160 --> 16:05.240]  to veg, how many weeks am I going to flower.
[16:05.240 --> 16:10.560]  Then that nutrient calculator will give you a recommendation on how much of each bottle
[16:10.560 --> 16:16.160]  nutrient to feed your plants per feeding and most of them are recommended on a weekly
[16:16.160 --> 16:17.320]  basis.
[16:17.320 --> 16:20.680]  So just as an example, we will type in that we have got, like I said, we have got grow,
[16:20.680 --> 16:23.880]  we have got a grow A, we have got a grow B, we have got a microbe, we have got a cow mag,
[16:23.880 --> 16:25.520]  probably got a bloom booster.
[16:25.520 --> 16:30.360]  So on week one of veg, it is probably going to say feed this many milliliters of A, this
[16:30.360 --> 16:35.440]  many milliliters of B, this much cow mag, this many milliliters of your microbes and
[16:35.440 --> 16:36.440]  this many milliliters.
[16:36.440 --> 16:39.120]  You are not going to use the bloom booster in veg because we are in veg, but you get
[16:39.120 --> 16:43.440]  the point and it is going to be how many milliliters of that nutrient per gallon of
[16:43.440 --> 16:44.480]  water.
[16:44.480 --> 16:49.040]  So for my example of my made up nutrient company today, we are going to use 50 milliliters
[16:49.040 --> 16:55.000]  of grow A and 50 milliliters of grow B and 20 mils of cow mag and then let's just say
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.520]  that my nutrient company likes 20 mils of microbes, so we will mix that up.
[16:59.520 --> 17:04.960]  Then at the bottom of that feed chart, quite often it will tell you what the EC or the
[17:04.960 --> 17:09.800]  PPMs of that mix should be approximately.
[17:09.800 --> 17:14.760]  Some of these companies will go as far as to tell you what the ECs or the PPMs will
[17:14.760 --> 17:17.360]  be after you add each ingredient.
[17:17.360 --> 17:23.320]  So it may say after I put in my 50 mils of A and 50 mils of B, the PPMs should be at
[17:23.320 --> 17:24.320]  800.
[17:24.320 --> 17:27.200]  And I am just making up numbers off the top of my head today.
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.000]  Then the chart will show that once you add the cow mag, it should bring your PPMs up
[17:31.000 --> 17:32.360]  to 1000.
[17:32.360 --> 17:36.760]  And the chart will show you what your PPMs will be for each week based on which bottle
[17:36.760 --> 17:38.680]  of nutrients you were using.
[17:38.680 --> 17:42.960]  Now there are a couple of things that get my attention here in this question.
[17:42.960 --> 17:47.840]  The first thing that gets my attention is that you are not using reverse osmosis water.
[17:47.840 --> 17:53.360]  All of those measurements are based on water starting at PPMs zero.
[17:53.360 --> 17:56.060]  So you were starting with stuff in your water.
[17:56.060 --> 17:59.920]  So what I would recommend is getting some of that water and testing the EC and the pH
[17:59.920 --> 18:03.440]  of that water before you mix your nutrients.
[18:03.440 --> 18:07.840]  In your email, you did say that the water coming out of your tap reads 0.2 on the tap,
[18:07.840 --> 18:10.920]  which is going to be a PPM of 100.
[18:10.920 --> 18:16.360]  So you're already starting off with 100 particles per million of something in your water.
[18:16.360 --> 18:20.720]  And to find out what's actually in there, you can go to your local water company and
[18:20.720 --> 18:23.680]  you can get a full report of what they're adding to your water.
[18:23.680 --> 18:25.400]  That will change seasonally.
[18:25.400 --> 18:29.360]  So if you are interested, if you're curious about that, check that out occasionally.
[18:29.800 --> 18:34.880]  I have noticed that periodically, seasonally, basically here in Colorado, they do change
[18:34.880 --> 18:36.760]  how they are treating our water.
[18:36.760 --> 18:41.760]  I discovered that they do make drastic changes because one day I was running a large facility
[18:41.760 --> 18:46.720]  in Colorado Springs and I turned on our normal water supply and it reeked of chlorine.
[18:46.720 --> 18:48.440]  I knew that that was not normal.
[18:48.440 --> 18:52.720]  So I immediately filled up a container and I did a couple of water tests to find out
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.280]  that the PPMs were extremely high.
[18:55.280 --> 18:58.680]  And I paid attention and that went down over the course of two weeks.
[18:58.680 --> 19:02.440]  So it feels like they just dosed it up real high to get that chlorine real high for the
[19:02.440 --> 19:07.160]  season and they just let it right out until the next time that they need to add more chlorine
[19:07.160 --> 19:08.920]  bombs or however they do it.
[19:08.920 --> 19:11.360]  So pay attention to your local water.
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.960]  Just because it is 0.2 today does not mean it is going to be 0.2 consistently.
[19:16.960 --> 19:21.880]  So we have basically got 100 PPMs of something in your water before you start mixing your
[19:21.880 --> 19:22.880]  nutrients.
[19:22.880 --> 19:29.080]  So when you put your PPM pen in your solution, immediately deduct 100 from the number which
[19:29.080 --> 19:30.760]  it is displaying.
[19:30.760 --> 19:36.540]  Another thing we need to keep in mind is that there are actually two different PPM scales.
[19:36.540 --> 19:40.560]  There is what is known as the 500 and the 700 PPM scale.
[19:40.560 --> 19:42.840]  Those will give you different readings.
[19:42.840 --> 19:48.560]  Is your nutrient company basing their measurement on the 500 or 700 scale?
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.840]  Is your PPM reader set to the 500 or the 700 scale?
[19:53.840 --> 19:58.840]  Those both need to be in sync or you will get the wrong reading.
[19:58.840 --> 20:05.120]  Another very important thing to think about here is, are your tools properly calibrated?
[20:05.120 --> 20:10.320]  Is your EC or PPM tool calibrated to the correct calibration?
[20:10.320 --> 20:12.120]  And I'm not saying that you may have made a mistake.
[20:12.120 --> 20:17.160]  I'm saying that everybody needs to check and double check that their tools are properly
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.520]  calibrated.
[20:18.520 --> 20:22.720]  Excessively check your pH and EC meters for proper calibration.
[20:22.720 --> 20:25.740]  I like to do that on the 1st and 15th of every month.
[20:25.740 --> 20:28.640]  On the 1st of every month, I also like to change a bunch of filters.
[20:28.640 --> 20:33.480]  If we've got air conditioning filters or maybe we've got filters that prevent too much sediment
[20:33.480 --> 20:38.280]  or gook from getting into the feed lines from a reservoir, any kind of filter like that,
[20:38.280 --> 20:42.460]  I like to clean those on the 1st and or 15th of each month.
[20:42.460 --> 20:47.040]  You should also check your RO machine filters if you're running reverse osmosis or any type
[20:47.040 --> 20:48.460]  of water filtration.
[20:48.460 --> 20:52.240]  Check those filters on the 1st of each month also and write that down.
[20:52.240 --> 20:56.160]  You should be writing down when you replace filters, when you replace bulbs, write all
[20:56.160 --> 20:57.860]  of that stuff down.
[20:57.860 --> 21:01.720]  On the outside of a flower room of any facility I am in charge of, there's usually a piece
[21:01.720 --> 21:05.840]  of duct tape on the top right corner of the door that'll tell you when those bulbs were
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  last changed.
[21:06.840 --> 21:11.400]  It will say brand new bulbs, the full room, December 1st, 1985.
[21:11.400 --> 21:14.800]  We know that we put all new bulbs in that room, December 1st, 85.
[21:14.800 --> 21:16.080]  There's no question about it.
[21:16.120 --> 21:17.320]  We need to change those bulbs.
[21:17.320 --> 21:19.240]  They've been in there way too fucking long.
[21:19.240 --> 21:20.640]  Let's get back on track here.
[21:20.640 --> 21:24.440]  Make sure your pen is properly calibrated.
[21:24.440 --> 21:28.960]  Once we have determined that we are using the appropriate PPM scale to where our nutrient
[21:28.960 --> 21:34.700]  company and our PPM pens are on the same page, once we have determined that our PPM meter
[21:34.700 --> 21:41.240]  is calibrated, the next thing to do is start figuring out how to get those PPMs correct.
[21:41.280 --> 21:47.760]  A lot of times, nutrient companies recommend way too much product for our plants.
[21:47.760 --> 21:52.420]  And the purpose behind that is because that makes us buy more product.
[21:52.420 --> 21:58.280]  If you can tell a consumer to use 100 milliliters and they have a slight risk of burning their
[21:58.280 --> 22:03.720]  plants with 100 milliliters, that company is going to try to get you to use 100, maybe
[22:03.720 --> 22:08.760]  120 milliliters so that you have to buy that product as frequently as possible, when in
[22:08.760 --> 22:16.720]  all reality, your plants will probably perform best at 50 to 75 milliliters of that product.
[22:16.720 --> 22:21.440]  Most nutrient companies are not in business to be your friend.
[22:21.440 --> 22:26.280]  Most nutrient companies are in business to sell nutrients.
[22:26.280 --> 22:32.840]  So if they can get you to use 15, 20, maybe 25% more product than you actually need so
[22:32.840 --> 22:37.160]  that you come back and spend that money sooner, they will definitely say the shit that they
[22:37.160 --> 22:43.000]  need to say to get you to spend the money if it is not going to destroy your plants.
[22:43.000 --> 22:48.120]  So the companies are going to recommend a high dosage in their nutrient calculators.
[22:48.120 --> 22:52.760]  If you mix your solution as suggested by the vendor, and you realize that your EC or your
[22:52.760 --> 22:59.360]  PPMs are higher than desired for your plants, the easiest thing to do is to dilute that
[22:59.360 --> 23:01.080]  with clean water.
[23:01.080 --> 23:05.000]  Just throw your hose right in there, put that bucket under the spigot and turn on the water.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.520]  While you've got your EC pen, your PPM meter in that bucket, and wait for that clean water
[23:10.520 --> 23:16.760]  to fill it up until you've reached the appropriate PPMs, just dilute it until it is the desired
[23:16.760 --> 23:21.680]  PPM level or EC level which you feel comfortable feeding to your plants.
[23:21.680 --> 23:26.320]  Now in your message, you expressed that you have seen growers feed high PPMs and high
[23:26.320 --> 23:30.980]  ECs, and you were amazed that they are not burning their plants.
[23:30.980 --> 23:37.200]  If we feed the plants appropriately at the appropriate times, without overlapping any
[23:37.200 --> 23:43.620]  specific nutrients, we can push the feeds quite hard if we understand what we are doing.
[23:43.620 --> 23:48.380]  If you were working with one nutrient company and using every bottle that they recommend
[23:48.380 --> 23:53.660]  from the lineup on their nutrient feed and your PPMs get a little bit high, you do have
[23:53.660 --> 23:56.140]  the opportunity for burning your plants.
[23:56.140 --> 24:01.620]  I feel you don't run as much of a risk as if you had mixed nutrients from other companies
[24:01.620 --> 24:06.300]  and made your own hodgepodge, franken-nutrient recipe.
[24:06.300 --> 24:11.180]  The reason for that is because whatever nutrient company, we're just going to say Rostegev's
[24:11.180 --> 24:15.180]  nutrient company, which I don't ever want that to happen, please don't ask for that.
[24:15.180 --> 24:18.060]  Rostegev's nutrient company puts out a product line.
[24:18.060 --> 24:22.900]  I know what is in bottle A, bottle B, and all of the subsequent bottles so that when
[24:22.900 --> 24:28.140]  I make my mix recommendations, I know you're not going to overlap too much nitrogen by
[24:28.140 --> 24:32.340]  adding the base nudes and then adding this other product that I think will help in week
[24:32.340 --> 24:33.340]  six.
[24:33.340 --> 24:36.860]  As the developer of that product, I already know how much nitrogen your plants are receiving
[24:36.860 --> 24:40.100]  so I know not to give you too much of that later in flour.
[24:40.100 --> 24:41.980]  I already know what's in everything else.
[24:41.980 --> 24:43.060]  I'm a good chef.
[24:43.060 --> 24:46.980]  I've paid attention to my ingredients and I know that you're not going to get over-salted
[24:46.980 --> 24:51.300]  or over-sweetened by adding the things that I recommend later in the game.
[24:51.340 --> 24:55.460]  I don't know what the other companies are going to add to their shit.
[24:55.460 --> 25:01.860]  It is very likely that their bloom booster may have something overlapping my base nutrient
[25:01.860 --> 25:03.140]  that you are using.
[25:03.140 --> 25:06.500]  Maybe my CalMag product also comes with enzymes.
[25:06.500 --> 25:09.980]  Maybe you're buying an enzymatic product and you're double-feeding the enzymes, which isn't
[25:09.980 --> 25:13.320]  going to cause a problem, but it is a waste of money.
[25:13.320 --> 25:18.620]  As long as you are not overlapping with any specific nutrient, with any specific element,
[25:18.620 --> 25:23.260]  you can really push the EC or the PPMs of the plants very high.
[25:23.260 --> 25:27.660]  The first thing I would suggest is finding out if your nutrient company is using the
[25:27.660 --> 25:31.300]  500 or 700 PPM scale.
[25:31.300 --> 25:37.300]  Then make sure that your PPM pen is calibrated to that same scale.
[25:37.300 --> 25:39.960]  Then I would test the water coming out of the tap.
[25:39.960 --> 25:43.580]  Then I would mix up my nutrient solution as normal.
[25:43.580 --> 25:50.020]  Then I would re-measure the EC, the PPMs, the pH, and the temperature of that solution.
[25:50.020 --> 25:51.940]  Then I would feed my plants.
[25:51.940 --> 25:54.740]  I would feed the plants until they had plenty of runoff.
[25:54.740 --> 26:00.140]  I would gather some of that runoff and I would measure the EC, the PPMs, and the pH of the
[26:00.140 --> 26:03.060]  runoff which comes out of those plants.
[26:03.060 --> 26:08.500]  I personally have a Google document for every grow which I am responsible for, and in that
[26:08.500 --> 26:11.680]  Google document, it shows the date of the watering.
[26:11.680 --> 26:14.920]  It shows everything that was put into that nutrient mix.
[26:14.920 --> 26:21.000]  Then it also shows the EC, the pH, the PPMs, and the temperature of that nutrient solution
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.720]  before it was fed to the plants.
[26:22.720 --> 26:27.480]  I also document how many gallons were fed to the entire room.
[26:27.480 --> 26:32.160]  Then after the plants are fed, I gather enough water for runoff from each table and I carefully
[26:32.160 --> 26:38.920]  measure and document the pH, the EC, and the PPMs of the runoff from each table.
[26:38.920 --> 26:40.800]  Then here is the most important part.
[26:40.920 --> 26:45.880]  I pay close attention to how the plants respond to that feeding.
[26:45.880 --> 26:50.300]  If the plants show me that they got too much nutrient, that is when I know I need to start
[26:50.300 --> 26:52.160]  dialing back my feeding.
[26:52.160 --> 26:56.600]  The way that I do that, I mix up my nutrients just like I did last time, and then I just
[26:56.600 --> 27:01.860]  dilute a little bit more with just clean water and bring my PPMs down just a little bit.
[27:01.860 --> 27:06.880]  That way my ratios of nutrients stay the same as the recommended dosage.
[27:06.880 --> 27:12.440]  I'm still getting the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium to calmag.
[27:12.440 --> 27:17.560]  My ratios are the same, but my dilutions and my dosages have gone down to where now my
[27:17.560 --> 27:20.560]  overall PPMs have lowered.
[27:20.560 --> 27:24.920]  As long as those plants aren't showing you that they are upset, you can feed them quite
[27:24.920 --> 27:30.880]  high PPMs, again, as long as you are not overlapping any specific nutrient.
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.700]  To recap this, just so I feel like I gave a solid answer, I would recommend starting
[27:34.700 --> 27:36.840]  with reverse osmosis water.
[27:36.840 --> 27:41.960]  If you can't use reverse osmosis water, measure the PPMs or the EC before you mix your solution
[27:41.960 --> 27:47.080]  and document that and deduct that number from the total once you mix your solution.
[27:47.080 --> 27:51.560]  I would make sure that my equipment is properly calibrated and that you are using the proper
[27:51.560 --> 27:54.760]  PPM scale or using the 700 or the 500.
[27:54.760 --> 27:57.440]  Again, what is your nutrient company using?
[27:57.440 --> 27:58.920]  Make sure that they match up.
[27:58.920 --> 28:02.480]  Then once you're confident that you are using the correct PPM scale and that you've got
[28:02.480 --> 28:07.120]  your PPMs and EC dialed in the way that you are comfortable with, feed your plants and
[28:07.120 --> 28:09.400]  take a lot of notes like I recommended.
[28:09.400 --> 28:13.200]  Then the most important thing is to pay attention to how the plants respond.
[28:13.200 --> 28:15.840]  If you feel like they're getting burned, reduce your PPMs.
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.280]  If you feel like they can use more, push them a little bit harder next time.
[28:19.280 --> 28:24.360]  I like to push them until I see the tips of the leaves just getting a little bit of burn.
[28:24.360 --> 28:26.640]  I call that getting their fingernails done.
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.240]  That is when you know that they're right there reaching that I'm going to burn point and
[28:31.240 --> 28:33.520]  you know you're getting the most out of them that you can.
[28:33.520 --> 28:36.920]  You're pushing them to their full potential and you're just barely making them break a
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.120]  sweat.
[28:38.120 --> 28:41.800]  One of your statements in your message says that for years now, I've never even checked
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.800]  the pH or the EC and now I find it frustrating trying to dial it in.
[28:46.800 --> 28:50.320]  It sounds like you were having good success before you started stressing too much over
[28:50.320 --> 28:52.200]  the PPMs and the EC.
[28:52.200 --> 28:56.360]  As long as your pH is correct and as long as your plants aren't showing you problems,
[28:56.360 --> 28:59.720]  don't stress too much over the numbers on the equipment.
[28:59.720 --> 29:01.680]  The plants are the boss.
[29:01.680 --> 29:05.160]  So pay attention to the ladies in the grow room and they will tell you everything you
[29:05.160 --> 29:06.160]  need to know.
[29:06.160 --> 29:08.560]  All right, Nick, I want to thank you for the great email.
