[00:00.640 --> 00:04.200]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:04.200 --> 00:09.720]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 615 of the Grow From Your
[00:09.720 --> 00:10.720]  Heart podcast.
[00:10.720 --> 00:14.080]  In this episode, I'm going to answer a few grow questions.
[00:14.080 --> 00:18.360]  Before we get there, let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:18.360 --> 00:23.360]  Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month
[00:23.360 --> 00:24.640]  level or higher.
[00:24.640 --> 00:28.120]  So with no further ado, let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank
[00:28.120 --> 00:31.120]  you shout out to my friend Godfather Kush.
[00:31.120 --> 00:34.640]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to OG Purple Thumb and Matt Hemingway.
[00:34.640 --> 00:37.880]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Dave's Not Here and TreeumUp.

[00:42.080 --> 00:44.920]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Lernon and Bernon.
[00:44.920 --> 00:48.960]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Smokey J1360 and Kojax.
[00:48.960 --> 00:52.680]  And let's wrap it up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[00:52.680 --> 00:56.180]  my friend Stoned Trout Bomb.
[00:56.180 --> 00:59.860]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[00:59.860 --> 01:03.300]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:03.300 --> 01:09.380]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:09.380 --> 01:13.020]  All of the information you need to support the show will be right there on the screen.
[01:13.020 --> 01:17.060]  And of course, I did include that link in the show notes and in the video description
[01:17.060 --> 01:20.060]  to make it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:20.060 --> 01:23.820]  Really you guys thank you for all of that continued Patreon support.
[01:23.820 --> 01:25.500]  I do appreciate it.
[01:25.500 --> 01:26.780]  Where do we go from there?
[01:26.780 --> 01:28.960]  Oh, I wanted to do something rare.
[01:28.960 --> 01:31.420]  We don't do this on the podcast a lot.
[01:31.420 --> 01:33.140]  I used to talk about what I do all the time.
[01:33.140 --> 01:35.140]  I used to talk about going to comedy shows.
[01:35.140 --> 01:37.620]  I used to talk about going to concerts.
[01:37.620 --> 01:38.620]  Guess what?
[01:38.620 --> 01:39.620]  We don't get to do that kind of shit anymore.
[01:39.620 --> 01:41.620]  So I've been doing some Netflixing.
[01:41.620 --> 01:42.740]  What did I watch on Netflix?
[01:42.740 --> 01:48.160]  I recently watched a documentary about the Cecil Hotel.
[01:48.160 --> 01:52.420]  To be really quick, we'll just say that that was a four hour show that could have been
[01:52.420 --> 01:54.620]  45 minutes.
[01:54.620 --> 01:59.980]  So before you jump in too far, the Cecil Hotel, all of the answers are in the first
[01:59.980 --> 02:01.780]  15 minutes of the show.
[02:01.780 --> 02:04.180]  Everything you needed to know was told to you in the beginning.
[02:04.180 --> 02:06.580]  You could put the whole damn story together.
[02:06.580 --> 02:08.020]  Watch it if you're really interested.
[02:08.020 --> 02:13.780]  But man, four hours of my life, I should have been recording podcasts or doing something
[02:13.780 --> 02:15.220]  way different.
[02:15.220 --> 02:19.260]  That shit could have been a 45, maybe an hour and 15 at the most.
[02:19.260 --> 02:23.140]  There was a lot of extra content that did not need to be in there.
[02:23.140 --> 02:26.260]  Long story, could have been a really short story.
[02:26.260 --> 02:27.660]  That's my review on the Cecil Hotel.
[02:27.660 --> 02:29.620]  All right, where do we go from there?
[02:29.620 --> 02:30.820]  The new Discord link.
[02:30.820 --> 02:35.420]  In the last episode, I mentioned that there were some upgrades to the Iry Genetics, Iry
[02:35.420 --> 02:36.780]  Army Discord.
[02:36.780 --> 02:40.380]  We have gotten our own vanity Discord link.
[02:40.380 --> 02:41.380]  That's right.
[02:41.380 --> 02:43.300]  Instead of saying it out loud right here, I'll just put it in the show notes and in
[02:43.300 --> 02:44.300]  the description.
[02:44.300 --> 02:45.780]  You guys can go ahead and just click on that.
[02:45.780 --> 02:48.100]  That'll take you right to the Discord.
[02:48.100 --> 02:52.700]  Join the Iry Army, Iry Genetics, Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:53.260 --> 02:54.260]  I'm a big Discord gang.
[02:54.260 --> 02:55.820]  There's a lot of cool shit going on over there.
[02:55.820 --> 02:58.700]  I don't, honestly, I don't participate enough in the Discord.
[02:58.700 --> 03:01.020]  I've got a lot going on, you guys.
[03:01.020 --> 03:02.460]  I make a lot of other things happen.
[03:02.460 --> 03:05.940]  So big thanks to the people that do make the Discord happen and who are on the Discord.
[03:05.940 --> 03:09.100]  But when I pop in there, holy shit, there's a lot happening.
[03:09.100 --> 03:11.100]  There are chat rooms happening.
[03:11.100 --> 03:12.860]  There are video chats happening.
[03:12.860 --> 03:15.300]  There are conversations about growing happening.
[03:15.300 --> 03:16.580]  There are auctions.
[03:16.580 --> 03:21.060]  There are all kinds of great, crazy, anything you can think of that may happen in an online
[03:21.060 --> 03:22.060]  community.
[03:22.420 --> 03:23.420]  All of that is probably happening in the Discord.
[03:23.420 --> 03:24.420]  So go check it out.
[03:24.420 --> 03:28.060]  It's a great time, a great place to go meet new members of the Iry Army.
[03:28.060 --> 03:32.460]  It's a good place for the Iry Army and the DGC to kind of mesh together right there.
[03:32.460 --> 03:36.780]  So a big shout out to everybody over there holding it down in the Discord.
[03:36.780 --> 03:38.740]  Also, this is completely random.
[03:38.740 --> 03:40.540]  I just heard it through my headphones a moment ago.
[03:40.540 --> 03:42.740]  Don't know if you guys can hear it.
[03:42.740 --> 03:47.700]  There are some cats in my neighborhood and I don't know if they are making babies or
[03:47.700 --> 03:51.580]  having babies, but they're right over there just a little bit.
[03:52.100 --> 03:53.100]  I haven't identified exactly where.
[03:53.100 --> 03:58.100]  I think it's out of my yard, but the yard next to me, behind me-ish, there are some
[03:58.100 --> 04:03.020]  cats over there either making kittens or having kittens or something similar.
[04:03.020 --> 04:06.820]  Or maybe I should go check further, but I'm pretty sure it's cats doing cat things over
[04:06.820 --> 04:07.820]  there.
[04:07.820 --> 04:09.820]  But if it comes through the headphones, there's nobody.
[04:09.820 --> 04:11.060]  Ha ha ha.
[04:11.060 --> 04:12.060]  There's nobody tied up here.
[04:12.060 --> 04:13.140]  Nothing weird's going on.
[04:13.140 --> 04:14.380]  I think those are cats.
[04:14.380 --> 04:17.900]  I've been hearing it randomly for a little bit this evening.
[04:17.940 --> 04:21.260]  I really want to believe that those are cats making that noise.
[04:21.260 --> 04:23.900]  I'm starting to wonder what it really is now.
[04:23.900 --> 04:24.900]  I shouldn't have brought that up.
[04:24.900 --> 04:25.900]  Anyway, those are cats.
[04:25.900 --> 04:29.660]  If it comes through the microphone, you guys, I'm going to, we're going to, that's my story
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.660]  and I'm sticking to it.
[04:30.660 --> 04:31.660]  It's cats.
[04:31.660 --> 04:33.460]  I think they're making more kittens over there.
[04:33.460 --> 04:34.860]  That's what it sounds like to me.
[04:34.860 --> 04:35.860]  All right.
[04:35.860 --> 04:38.900]  So I did say at the start of the show, I was going to answer some Grow questions.
[04:38.900 --> 04:44.120]  Let's get right to that part so we don't have to talk about cats making kittens anymore.
[04:44.120 --> 04:45.620]  Let's get right to the Grow question part.
[04:45.620 --> 04:49.780]  This one came from my email inbox and it came from, I'm looking to see if they want
[04:49.780 --> 04:50.780]  their name said.
[04:50.780 --> 04:54.820]  They did not give me a name to use, so I'm not going to give them a, their name said,
[04:54.820 --> 04:55.820]  but shout out to you.
[04:55.820 --> 04:57.620]  You'll know who you are when I read your message.
[04:57.620 --> 04:59.060]  It goes just like this.
[04:59.060 --> 05:04.020]  It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, I just started listening to your podcast and I really like it.
[05:04.020 --> 05:05.020]  Thank you.
[05:05.020 --> 05:06.020]  I appreciate that.
[05:06.020 --> 05:07.020]  I appreciate you for listening.
[05:07.020 --> 05:08.020]  Thank you.
[05:08.020 --> 05:10.720]  It said, I'm not sure if you've been asked or answered this before, but what are your
[05:10.720 --> 05:13.140]  thoughts on curing with humidity packs?
[05:13.140 --> 05:14.740]  And he actually listed a brand name.
[05:14.860 --> 05:16.420]  He said, Boveda.
[05:16.420 --> 05:18.780]  There are several brands of humidity packs available.
[05:18.780 --> 05:24.860]  I'm not going to endorse or bash or promote or belittle any particular brand.
[05:24.860 --> 05:29.660]  This is my overall opinion on the humidity packs, which are used to preserve, dry and
[05:29.660 --> 05:30.660]  cure.
[05:30.660 --> 05:31.940]  Originally were for cigars.
[05:31.940 --> 05:36.180]  Now they're used in the cannabis industry quite a bit, but let's talk about how I feel
[05:36.180 --> 05:38.180]  about Boveda packs.
[05:38.180 --> 05:42.980]  I don't really find it necessary to use a Boveda pack if you dried and cured your product
[05:42.980 --> 05:46.340]  properly in the beginning.
[05:46.340 --> 05:48.940]  That does take a little bit of experience to get to that point.
[05:48.940 --> 05:53.220]  So maybe if you're using it as a little bit of a training wheel for drying and curing,
[05:53.220 --> 05:54.220]  that's acceptable.
[05:54.220 --> 05:57.740]  I don't need a Boveda pack to dry and cure my product.
[05:57.740 --> 06:01.060]  I don't think it's necessary, but it's helpful if it's working for you, do it.
[06:01.060 --> 06:03.700]  Don't stop doing something just because Rasta Jeff doesn't do it.
[06:03.700 --> 06:05.540]  I don't think it's necessary.
[06:05.540 --> 06:09.060]  I think, and this is my opinion, Mike seems to agree with me.
[06:09.060 --> 06:10.500]  A few people have argued.
[06:10.500 --> 06:12.700]  Some people agree with me.
[06:13.420 --> 06:18.460]  I think if you cure with the Boveda pack in there, it gives it sort of a moist, different
[06:18.460 --> 06:21.340]  flavor that you don't want in the finished product.
[06:21.340 --> 06:26.020]  If you wait until the product is properly dried and cured and you're preserving that
[06:26.020 --> 06:30.340]  moisture level with a Boveda pack, then it works well and it tastes good.
[06:30.340 --> 06:34.580]  So I don't think it's necessary for actually drying and curing the product.
[06:34.580 --> 06:39.380]  I think it's better for long-term storage and for preserving the freshness of the product
[06:39.380 --> 06:42.020]  once you've got it stored for a while.
[06:42.060 --> 06:45.980]  Maybe more long-term storage, not drying and curing is what I'm trying to say.
[06:45.980 --> 06:51.660]  Then also my opinion has widely varied and swayed back and forth over time when it comes
[06:51.660 --> 06:54.460]  to the Boveda and other brand humidity packs.
[06:54.460 --> 06:57.940]  I've said before that I think it kind of leaves a weird flavor.
[06:57.940 --> 07:01.220]  It kind of, and I could be completely full of shit.
[07:01.220 --> 07:03.620]  Maybe it was something else in the grow doing that.
[07:03.620 --> 07:05.940]  But I feel like it was making the buds taste different.
[07:05.940 --> 07:10.780]  When we quit using the Boveda packs, the herb tasted better in my opinion.
[07:11.740 --> 07:16.540]  I do live in Colorado where I experience what is known as the Colorado crunch.
[07:16.540 --> 07:21.060]  If I go buy, if I buy an eighth or an ounce of weed from the dispensary, it's going to
[07:21.060 --> 07:26.420]  be crunchy because the dispensary weed is stored in a jar on the shelf to where everybody
[07:26.420 --> 07:27.860]  can see it that comes in.
[07:27.860 --> 07:30.340]  The bud tender grabs it, sets it out in front of you.
[07:30.340 --> 07:33.900]  You smell it, or maybe not now during COVID, but during most times you'd smell it.
[07:33.900 --> 07:37.740]  Then they open it up, they pop off the lid, they weigh out either an eighth or they weigh
[07:37.740 --> 07:40.980]  out at a quarter or maybe your ounce if that's what you're buying, maybe two ounces if you're
[07:40.980 --> 07:41.980]  going hard.
[07:41.980 --> 07:44.980]  Then they put the lid back on it and they put it back on the shelf.
[07:44.980 --> 07:48.140]  Maybe they popped open three or four other jars and showed you all of those at the same
[07:48.140 --> 07:49.140]  time.
[07:49.140 --> 07:50.980]  That's happening with every customer that comes in there.
[07:50.980 --> 07:53.540]  So that weed is getting super dry.
[07:53.540 --> 07:57.980]  If they put that herb back in a big container at the end of the night with the Boveda package
[07:57.980 --> 08:03.660]  and sealed it up, or maybe just put some Boveda packs in that jar, that may prevent that Colorado
[08:03.660 --> 08:04.660]  crispiness.
[08:04.660 --> 08:07.660]  That may be a good use for the Boveda pack there.
[08:08.220 --> 08:13.500]  If you're slow drying it and slow curing it, get it as close as you can to perfect, then
[08:13.500 --> 08:15.060]  add the Boveda pack.
[08:15.060 --> 08:19.580]  If you mess it up and get it too dry, then that's when I would say to reintroduce that
[08:19.580 --> 08:22.380]  Boveda pack and re-moisten the product at that time.
[08:22.380 --> 08:28.180]  But I think if you're doing it right, you don't really need the Boveda pack.
[08:28.180 --> 08:33.340]  If you've got enough product to where you think you may need to store it with the pack,
[08:33.340 --> 08:35.580]  like I said earlier, if you like it, do it.
[08:35.620 --> 08:39.580]  Maybe get a small jar and try it with the Boveda pack and a small jar and try it without.
[08:39.580 --> 08:44.860]  I think if you dry it and cure it properly and you get a big jar that you keep your personal
[08:44.860 --> 08:50.740]  stash in, put a couple of packs in there just to keep that one long-term fresh.
[08:50.740 --> 08:54.460]  Then however often it takes you to smoke an eighth of weed, take an eighth out of your
[08:54.460 --> 08:59.020]  big jar, put it in your smaller jar and make that one the jar that you pop open and close
[08:59.020 --> 09:00.020]  all the time.
[09:00.020 --> 09:04.460]  So you got your big storage jar, you got your smaller jar, that way your big jar stays fresh,
[09:04.460 --> 09:06.300]  it's not getting cracked open all the time.
[09:06.300 --> 09:08.940]  Then you got your smaller one that does get opened and closed all the time when you're
[09:08.940 --> 09:10.580]  reaching for a nug.
[09:10.580 --> 09:14.020]  Maybe even put a Boveda pack in with that eighth, maybe a quarter depending on how hard
[09:14.020 --> 09:15.460]  you smoke.
[09:15.460 --> 09:20.180]  But you asked mainly about curing, thoughts on curing with Boveda humidity packs.
[09:20.180 --> 09:22.300]  I would prefer dry and cure without it.
[09:22.300 --> 09:28.060]  Use a dialed-in room, use jars, use a humidifier and a dehumidifier, use a heater and an air
[09:28.060 --> 09:30.820]  conditioner, use those things for your drying and curing.
[09:30.820 --> 09:35.540]  Then once it's in the jar, trimmed up, just getting that final touch, that's when you
[09:35.540 --> 09:38.300]  can add the Bovedas in my opinion.
[09:38.300 --> 09:40.980]  I don't want to bash the product, I don't want to bash the company.
[09:40.980 --> 09:42.320]  Many people love them.
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.100]  I just think if it's done properly, you don't need them until it comes to that long-term
[09:46.100 --> 09:47.340]  storage.
[09:47.340 --> 09:48.780]  That's when they do come in very handy.
[09:48.780 --> 09:51.580]  They prevent you from getting that Colorado crunch.
[09:51.580 --> 09:57.060]  So put your big jar, put a couple of Boveda packs in the big jar and then if you've got
[09:57.060 --> 10:00.460]  some bud that you did get from the dispensary that came and it showed up all crispy and
[10:00.500 --> 10:03.580]  crunchy, throw in a couple of Boveda packs in there.
[10:03.580 --> 10:06.660]  That will help re-moisten and stabilize that product.
[10:06.660 --> 10:10.100]  Alright, I think I rambled on long enough about the Boveda packs.
[10:10.100 --> 10:12.580]  I do have some friends that have a podcast.
[10:12.580 --> 10:17.660]  They did do the Boveda challenge where they put some dried and cured herbs into two different
[10:17.660 --> 10:20.060]  jars, one with the Boveda, one without.
[10:20.060 --> 10:21.120]  And you could tell the difference.
[10:21.120 --> 10:22.860]  The one with it was a little moister.
[10:22.860 --> 10:24.300]  Moister, is that a word?
[10:24.300 --> 10:25.700]  It is now because I said it, right?
[10:25.700 --> 10:28.260]  Somebody put that in the dictionary, moister.
[10:28.260 --> 10:29.700]  It was more moist.
[10:29.700 --> 10:31.380]  One bud was more moist, more supple.
[10:31.380 --> 10:32.820]  It burned a little differently.
[10:32.820 --> 10:35.700]  The other had that Colorado crunch effect that I talk about.
[10:35.700 --> 10:40.060]  You could just hear it go, if you broke it up by the microphone, it burned really quickly.
[10:40.060 --> 10:44.020]  But I didn't get to taste that herb so I can't testify to the flavor.
[10:44.020 --> 10:49.860]  Visually, audibly, it did look and appear and sound like better product but I didn't
[10:49.860 --> 10:53.700]  get to consume it so I can't testify much to that.
[10:53.700 --> 10:57.940]  But the quick summary, drying and curing, don't need it.
[10:58.100 --> 11:02.420]  Or re-moistening is the word we're going to use.
[11:02.420 --> 11:04.940]  That is when I would use the Boveda packs.
[11:04.940 --> 11:06.180]  Got awful rambling on that one.
[11:06.180 --> 11:08.060]  This could be a long show.
[11:08.060 --> 11:12.500]  The next question, oh by the way, that question came from my email box, my email inbox.
[11:12.500 --> 11:15.600]  My email address is, holy shit, that was hard to say.
[11:15.600 --> 11:20.740]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[11:20.740 --> 11:24.420]  Since I put so much effort into it, please use that email address.
[11:24.420 --> 11:26.220]  Send me your grow questions.
[11:26.220 --> 11:29.780]  This question came from the grow help tab on my website.
[11:29.780 --> 11:32.780]  My website is iRegenetics.com.
[11:32.780 --> 11:36.020]  On that website, you will find a tab that says grow help.
[11:36.020 --> 11:39.620]  If you click on that grow help tab, you can ask grow questions.
[11:39.620 --> 11:43.240]  We ask you a few preliminary questions just to kind of give me an idea of what's going
[11:43.240 --> 11:44.240]  on in your grow.
[11:44.240 --> 11:48.580]  Then at the bottom, it says the problem and that's where you are given the opportunity
[11:48.580 --> 11:50.900]  to tell me about the problem in your grow.
[11:50.900 --> 11:55.980]  Then I will read that on the podcast and we will diagnose or recommend some solutions
[11:56.020 --> 11:57.620]  for your problem.
[11:57.620 --> 11:59.560]  That's where this question came from.
[11:59.560 --> 12:03.980]  They want me to use the name t.420 on Instagram.
[12:03.980 --> 12:05.980]  So this one came from t.420.
[12:05.980 --> 12:10.620]  T.420 is growing cookies kush from Barney's Farm.
[12:10.620 --> 12:16.660]  They're growing washing machine from Ripper Seeds and one smoothie auto by 42 Fast Buds.
[12:16.660 --> 12:18.540]  It was a sample seed.
[12:18.540 --> 12:22.380]  A lot of these details are not necessary because I know the question.
[12:22.380 --> 12:23.380]  Let's skip some of that.
[12:23.380 --> 12:24.380]  What are you feeding it?
[12:25.380 --> 12:26.380]  Remo Nutrients.
[12:26.380 --> 12:28.500]  I don't know if that's Ramo or Remo Nutrients, but shout out.
[12:28.500 --> 12:33.500]  Ramo's a cool ass dude up there in Canada growing with the Ramo Nutrients using five
[12:33.500 --> 12:40.180]  mils of micro, five mils of grow, five mils of Velo Kelp, eight mils of Magnifical.
[12:40.180 --> 12:44.220]  That sounds like a fucking great name for a product, for the CalMag product.
[12:44.220 --> 12:45.620]  Five mils of Nature's Candy.
[12:45.620 --> 12:51.740]  I can imagine that that's like a sweetener and five, eight milliliters of microbial mass.
[12:51.740 --> 12:52.860]  It says it's the first time.
[12:52.860 --> 12:57.220]  I'll continue to use this once every two weeks.
[12:57.220 --> 13:00.460]  Then it says a little more about the grow, which isn't necessary for the question.
[13:00.460 --> 13:02.220]  It says I have a small question here.
[13:02.220 --> 13:06.780]  Since I'm starting the microbial mass, should I follow the dosage indicated on the bottle
[13:06.780 --> 13:11.420]  or should I reduce it to half as I have with the rest of my nutrients like you suggest
[13:11.420 --> 13:13.020]  in your videos?
[13:13.020 --> 13:14.500]  Thank you so much for your time.
[13:14.500 --> 13:16.700]  I really am learning a lot from you.
[13:16.700 --> 13:21.420]  Watching your videos reminds me of my chef when I was an apprentice.
[13:21.420 --> 13:23.740]  There's a lot of stuff there in that last fucking sentence.
[13:23.740 --> 13:24.740]  Holy shit.
[13:24.740 --> 13:25.740]  You're learning a lot.
[13:25.740 --> 13:26.740]  Thank you.
[13:26.740 --> 13:27.740]  I do appreciate that.
[13:27.740 --> 13:28.740]  It makes me feel good.
[13:28.740 --> 13:31.380]  It makes it worth my time knowing that you are learning a lot.
[13:31.380 --> 13:35.020]  The time that I put into this, the energy, the equipment, the effort is worth it because
[13:35.020 --> 13:36.020]  you're learning a lot.
[13:36.020 --> 13:37.660]  That means a lot.
[13:37.660 --> 13:41.860]  Reminds me of when you were of your chef when you were the apprentice.
[13:41.860 --> 13:43.300]  I like that.
[13:43.300 --> 13:44.300]  You can be the grasshopper.
[13:44.300 --> 13:45.300]  I'll be Mr. Miyagi.
[13:45.300 --> 13:46.500]  However you want to do it.
[13:46.500 --> 13:48.620]  As long as you're learning, bro, I will keep teaching.
[13:48.620 --> 13:50.540]  I'm glad you're following along.
[13:50.660 --> 13:56.180]  Now, let's get past the wax on, wax off portion and let's talk about the recommendation here.
[13:56.180 --> 13:59.620]  You are using a product called Microbial Mass.
[13:59.620 --> 14:01.860]  I did a little quick research.
[14:01.860 --> 14:02.860]  It looks fancy.
[14:02.860 --> 14:04.020]  It looks a little bit expensive.
[14:04.020 --> 14:06.760]  It's got a lot of fancy microbes in there.
[14:06.760 --> 14:08.520]  It's packaged up very well.
[14:08.520 --> 14:13.660]  As long as it is not too expensive, I would probably use that product as recommended.
[14:13.660 --> 14:19.280]  I do recommend most of the time that you use most products at about half to three quarters
[14:19.280 --> 14:20.720]  of the recommended strength.
[14:20.720 --> 14:24.760]  If it says use 100, I say start with 50, see how it responds.
[14:24.760 --> 14:27.240]  Then try 75, see how it responds.
[14:27.240 --> 14:31.000]  You rarely have to go all the way up to 100% of what they recommend.
[14:31.000 --> 14:35.400]  I like to have faith in the companies which we choose to work with, but they are in the
[14:35.400 --> 14:37.020]  business of doing business.
[14:37.020 --> 14:39.540]  Their business is you buying more nutrients.
[14:39.540 --> 14:44.720]  If they can get you to splash on just a few extra milliliters a few times a week, that's
[14:44.720 --> 14:45.720]  that much sooner.
[14:45.720 --> 14:48.080]  You got to buy that many more bottles.
[14:48.080 --> 14:51.720]  If they can get you to use it more quickly, they certainly will.
[14:51.720 --> 14:52.720]  They're not in your grow.
[14:52.720 --> 14:55.400]  They don't know what you're growing, how you're growing, when you're growing, what you're
[14:55.400 --> 14:56.400]  doing.
[14:56.400 --> 14:57.800]  Those are recommendations.
[14:57.800 --> 14:59.440]  I would start with about half of that.
[14:59.440 --> 15:00.800]  Maybe your plants are going to fucking thrive.
[15:00.800 --> 15:03.760]  A lot of plants respond better with a little bit of nutrients.
[15:03.760 --> 15:07.720]  When you start putting more on, you start seeing what the nutrients do, not what the
[15:07.720 --> 15:08.720]  plant does.
[15:08.720 --> 15:12.880]  I like to see what my plants do, then adapt my nutrients to that.
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.960]  In most cases, I would recommend starting with about 50% of the recommended dosage on
[15:16.960 --> 15:20.960]  the bottle, then work your way up maybe to 75, maybe 80.
[15:20.960 --> 15:24.240]  You're rarely going to get up to need 100% of the recommended dosage on the bottle.
[15:24.240 --> 15:27.000]  I don't know if you guys hear the weird noises happening in my neighborhood, but I'm sorry
[15:27.000 --> 15:31.960]  if I look distracted momentarily, because I certainly was.
[15:31.960 --> 15:33.280]  Let's get back on track.
[15:33.280 --> 15:36.920]  You're probably going to need 50% to 75% of the recommended dosage on the bottle.
[15:36.920 --> 15:41.240]  For the micro products, however, the other products, let me back up.
[15:41.240 --> 15:45.880]  The other products, you do have the opportunity, the potential to burn your plants.
[15:45.880 --> 15:46.880]  You can cause problems.
[15:46.880 --> 15:47.880]  You can burn the leaf tips.
[15:47.880 --> 15:49.320]  You can burn the whole damn leaf.
[15:49.320 --> 15:50.480]  You can cause root issues.
[15:50.480 --> 15:51.880]  You can cause lockouts.
[15:51.880 --> 15:56.480]  You can disrupt the soil and the plant growth altogether with a lot of those products.
[15:56.480 --> 16:00.920]  Those salty products, those chelated, buffered nutrients can do a lot of damage.
[16:00.920 --> 16:06.280]  The micro products, I don't really, in my opinion, feel like you can overdose on micro
[16:06.280 --> 16:07.280]  products.
[16:07.280 --> 16:09.640]  The thing to think about there is cost effectiveness.
[16:09.640 --> 16:12.160]  You said you were going to use it every two weeks.
[16:12.160 --> 16:16.520]  I think I'd like to see it maybe every once a week if you're going to use a micro product.
[16:17.160 --> 16:20.320]  I didn't research how often to use it, but in my opinion, it feels like once a week is
[16:20.320 --> 16:24.680]  enough to keep those colonies thriving just to get those microbes, whatever you've got
[16:24.680 --> 16:26.760]  going on, once a week gets them going.
[16:26.760 --> 16:30.920]  If you're using tap water, if you're using filtered water, some of your microbes are
[16:30.920 --> 16:35.420]  going to be destroyed by environmental factors, by competition within the root zone, maybe
[16:35.420 --> 16:38.660]  just by chlorine in your water, maybe chloramine in your water.
[16:38.660 --> 16:42.400]  A lot of things are going to be competing and destroying your microbes.
[16:42.400 --> 16:46.300]  Maybe if you use a little bit too much, all you're doing is supercharging, overpowering
[16:46.340 --> 16:51.620]  the other things and keeping that microbe colony super strong within your rhizosphere.
[16:51.620 --> 16:55.860]  If it is cost effective and it's not cutting into your budget, if you're still able to
[16:55.860 --> 16:59.340]  afford the rest of your nutrients and eat like a king and buy good concentrates, I would
[16:59.340 --> 17:04.020]  say feed that bad dog that microbe product as recommended.
[17:04.020 --> 17:06.540]  If it feels excessive, maybe reduce it.
[17:06.540 --> 17:08.980]  You said you're going to do it every two weeks.
[17:08.980 --> 17:13.940]  Again, unless it says to do it every two weeks, I would almost do it every once a week.
[17:13.940 --> 17:19.420]  Every other microbe product I can think of, they recommend doing it once per week.
[17:19.420 --> 17:23.140]  I'd read the bottle, see if they say once a week or once every two weeks.
[17:23.140 --> 17:27.300]  Basically, if you're going to use the rest of Remo's instructions, the rest of his bottles,
[17:27.300 --> 17:31.460]  I would just go with what he recommends at that recommended level.
[17:31.460 --> 17:34.100]  I've seen Remo's plants and I've seen what he does.
[17:34.100 --> 17:36.260]  That dude has a kick-ass garden.
[17:36.260 --> 17:38.420]  Shout out to Remo and Remo Nutrients.
[17:38.420 --> 17:41.780]  If that's the dude that I'm thinking that makes these nutrients, it's got to be ... That's
[17:41.780 --> 17:42.780]  the dude's name.
[17:42.780 --> 17:43.780]  It's got to be what you're using.
[17:43.820 --> 17:46.820]  Yeah, shout out to Remo.
[17:46.820 --> 17:49.620]  Just use the recommended part on that microbe product.
[17:49.620 --> 17:50.940]  I really don't think you'll overdo it.
[17:50.940 --> 17:52.780]  I don't think you'll overdose it.
[17:52.780 --> 17:57.020]  You'll just be compensating for anything that may be destroying any of the microbes that
[17:57.020 --> 17:58.020]  you've already got going on.
[17:58.020 --> 18:02.020]  If it's chlorine, chloramine, or competition within the root zone.
[18:02.020 --> 18:05.300]  If you've got a bunch of microbes in there, that just prevents you from getting other
[18:05.300 --> 18:09.940]  bad or other things which may be bad into that root zone.
[18:09.940 --> 18:13.540]  Big shout out to my friend T.420.
[18:13.580 --> 18:14.580]  That's his Instagram name.
[18:14.580 --> 18:16.660]  He wants to be called T.420.
[18:16.660 --> 18:18.300]  Thank you for the great question, bro.
[18:18.300 --> 18:19.940]  I hope I was able to help you out.
[18:19.940 --> 18:24.180]  Go ahead and use that product if it is cost effective.
[18:24.180 --> 18:28.660]  One thing I should add, and I'm not trying to diss on anybody's nutrient line, but if
[18:28.660 --> 18:33.300]  you do find that maybe you're using a nutrient line and maybe the microbes from that line
[18:33.300 --> 18:38.660]  are too expensive or maybe the enzymes are too expensive or maybe the CalMag is too expensive,
[18:38.660 --> 18:43.700]  you don't have to always use the full lineup of one company.
[18:43.700 --> 18:47.940]  You don't have to use Ramos, everything, everything, everything, Ramo.
[18:47.940 --> 18:52.380]  If you find that there's a more affordable, more cost effective microbe product, you can
[18:52.380 --> 18:57.660]  absolutely swap it out for this microbial product if it fits your budget, your wallet,
[18:57.660 --> 19:01.300]  your style, your grow better.
[19:01.300 --> 19:05.540]  But with that being said, be very careful that you don't overlap anything.
[19:05.540 --> 19:09.820]  When you're reading the bottles, see what your NPK values are, your nitrogen, phosphorus,
[19:09.820 --> 19:10.820]  potassium.
[19:10.820 --> 19:14.620]  See how much, if there's calcium or magnesium in one bottle, maybe there's boron and copper
[19:14.620 --> 19:16.320]  and zinc in one bottle.
[19:16.320 --> 19:21.280]  Make sure you're not overlapping any nutrients in two different bottles because this company
[19:21.280 --> 19:25.420]  probably put a few elements in a couple of bottles and you can mix them up and get the
[19:25.420 --> 19:26.420]  ideal mix.
[19:26.420 --> 19:30.460]  But this other company did similar, but they mixed bottles a little bit differently.
[19:30.460 --> 19:36.120]  So you do have the potential to maybe overlap nitrogen or phosphorus or potassium or calcium.
[19:36.120 --> 19:37.120]  It is possible.
[19:37.120 --> 19:40.760]  So it's your responsibility to read those bottles and make sure.
[19:40.760 --> 19:47.560]  But as a grower, as a breeder with a lot of experience, I've talked about using Veg Bloom
[19:47.560 --> 19:52.000]  and New Millennium at the same time, but I'm also mixing in, what's that Bloom Booster
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.520]  that I can never remember the name of, the one with the bat guano stuff on it, Bud Swell.
[19:56.520 --> 19:57.520]  There we go.
[19:57.520 --> 19:59.780]  I just have to stop thinking about it and the name comes to my brain.
[19:59.800 --> 20:01.640]  I'm also mixing in Bud Swell.
[20:01.640 --> 20:04.520]  I'm also mixing in silicium.
[20:04.520 --> 20:10.120]  I also mix in other products that are not New Millennium or Veg Bloom based.
[20:10.120 --> 20:14.080]  So there are other random products that do go into my grow because they work well with
[20:14.080 --> 20:15.080]  my recipe.
[20:15.080 --> 20:21.000]  It's all about, even if you give a professional chef a written recipe, he's going to go,
[20:21.000 --> 20:22.280]  eh, you said to use this.
[20:22.280 --> 20:26.040]  I want to use this and make it mine because he's the chef and I'm the fucking grower and
[20:26.040 --> 20:28.140]  I know what results I'm looking for.
[20:28.140 --> 20:33.440]  So I'm able to kind of manipulate my feeds, custom tailor my feeds, dial in my feeds to
[20:33.440 --> 20:37.360]  give me exactly what I need for the outcome, which I need.
[20:37.360 --> 20:41.260]  That way, like week three, if I say, oh man, I'm running a little bit low on this, I can
[20:41.260 --> 20:45.580]  grab something and I know what to mix in to add that to make my plants go kapow, shebang.
[20:45.580 --> 20:49.460]  I'm not limited by what this lineup says to do.
[20:49.460 --> 20:54.600]  Maybe I only need one element and all these bottles have three elements in each bottle
[20:54.600 --> 20:55.860]  and I just need one thing.
[20:56.680 --> 20:59.680]  Maybe I've got a product that's got that one fucking thing in there ready, readily available.
[20:59.680 --> 21:02.200]  I don't have to add the nitrogen and the other stuff in there.
[21:02.200 --> 21:04.860]  Get that one in there with the other bottle from another brand.
[21:04.860 --> 21:08.000]  Just be careful if you go doing that stuff, you guys, but don't think that you have to
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.320]  buy just because you bought one brand of something doesn't mean you have to stick with that entire
[21:12.320 --> 21:13.320]  lineup.
[21:13.320 --> 21:16.380]  It's much easier when you're a beginner grower to do that, but as you get better, maybe you
[21:16.380 --> 21:17.760]  can add some other things.
[21:17.760 --> 21:20.320]  I feel like I've said enough into that.
[21:20.320 --> 21:22.920]  Let's keep going with this podcast.
[21:22.920 --> 21:23.920]  I think the cats are done.
[21:23.980 --> 21:24.980]  I haven't heard them in a few minutes.
[21:24.980 --> 21:27.920]  Hopefully I didn't just jinx myself.
[21:27.920 --> 21:29.660]  The next message came from my email.
[21:29.660 --> 21:31.340]  No, this one came from Patreon.
[21:31.340 --> 21:32.900]  This one came from Coach Steve.
[21:32.900 --> 21:33.900]  Shout out to Coach Steve.
[21:33.900 --> 21:34.900]  I hear from you a lot.
[21:34.900 --> 21:38.740]  Thank you for supporting the Grow From Your Heart podcast and the DGC.
[21:38.740 --> 21:41.540]  This message goes just like this.
[21:41.540 --> 21:42.540]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[21:42.540 --> 21:44.100]  I hope you've had a great weekend.
[21:44.100 --> 21:45.100]  I had a great weekend.
[21:45.100 --> 21:46.100]  Thank you, bro.
[21:46.100 --> 21:47.100]  About to have another great weekend.
[21:47.100 --> 21:48.100]  Not to toot my own horn.
[21:48.100 --> 21:50.220]  It is about to be my birthday weekend.
[21:50.220 --> 21:52.620]  I think this episode will come out on my birthday.
[21:52.960 --> 21:56.680]  I'll be smoking dabs and eating cake and having a good ass time.
[21:56.680 --> 21:58.800]  I promise you I had a good weekend.
[21:58.800 --> 22:03.320]  It says, I just listened to episode 603 on the topic of light leaks and I don't think
[22:03.320 --> 22:07.200]  I heard you mention a dark period for vegetative plants.
[22:07.200 --> 22:09.080]  If you did, I'm sorry I missed that.
[22:09.080 --> 22:14.080]  Yes, I did talk about light leaks in depth on a previous episode and I did not talk about
[22:14.080 --> 22:16.420]  vegetative plants very much.
[22:16.420 --> 22:18.280]  Vegetative plants get overlooked quite often.
[22:18.280 --> 22:20.280]  We're going to discuss that here in just a moment.
[22:20.300 --> 22:24.700]  The message goes on to say, I do see a lot of growers treating the dark period in veg
[22:24.700 --> 22:27.300]  with the same rules as flower.
[22:27.300 --> 22:28.920]  Can you please mention that?
[22:28.920 --> 22:33.980]  Can you please mention that during veg you do not need uninterrupted darkness?
[22:33.980 --> 22:36.660]  Then it says, great show as always.
[22:36.660 --> 22:39.700]  Thanks from Coach Steve.
[22:39.700 --> 22:41.820]  You are right.
[22:41.820 --> 22:44.240]  Technically you're right.
[22:44.240 --> 22:49.060]  We don't need uninterrupted darkness in the vegetative stage.
[22:49.160 --> 22:51.120]  Do you like getting woken up when you're sleeping, bro?
[22:51.120 --> 22:55.440]  Either to the plants, there are processes happening when they're sleeping.
[22:55.440 --> 22:57.440]  It's best not to disrupt them.
[22:57.440 --> 22:59.640]  We can, but it's best not to.
[22:59.640 --> 23:04.280]  Once they've gone to sleep for their, if it's four to six, maybe eight hours, it's best
[23:04.280 --> 23:08.920]  just to let them rest, but it is not nearly as critical.
[23:08.920 --> 23:13.240]  If you must interrupt a light cycle in a grow, let it happen during the veg.
[23:13.240 --> 23:17.480]  If you've got to set up a grow space and you've got two rooms and you have to walk through
[23:17.580 --> 23:21.860]  one to get to the other, always make the walkthrough room, the veg space, because you can have
[23:21.860 --> 23:24.180]  that one on, you can turn it on if you need to get through there.
[23:24.180 --> 23:26.040]  The flower room, you cannot interrupt.
[23:26.040 --> 23:29.980]  That's what we discussed in the previous episode, but you're correct.
[23:29.980 --> 23:36.500]  It is mostly, mostly important not to interrupt that dark period during the veg stage just
[23:36.500 --> 23:37.940]  because things are happening.
[23:37.940 --> 23:40.180]  That's when a lot of processes happen is at night.
[23:40.180 --> 23:41.580]  So the plants are just chilling.
[23:41.580 --> 23:44.340]  They're doing a lot of processing and we don't want to disrupt that.
[23:44.340 --> 23:46.420]  You don't like being woken up in the middle of the night.
[23:46.440 --> 23:49.400]  So just let them process, let them do their things, but it is not critical.
[23:49.400 --> 23:51.600]  You're not going to cause hermaphroditism.
[23:51.600 --> 23:52.840]  They're not going to freak out on you.
[23:52.840 --> 23:54.920]  It won't be hypercritical.
[23:54.920 --> 24:00.880]  So let's talk more about the veg phase because I did like that inspiration.
[24:00.880 --> 24:01.880]  You're right.
[24:01.880 --> 24:07.600]  It's not as critical to keep them in the dark phase, but the veg phase is often overlooked
[24:07.600 --> 24:11.320]  and people way heavily only focus like I did in that episode.
[24:11.320 --> 24:15.120]  Heavily, heavily, they focus too much on the flower phase.
[24:15.140 --> 24:21.860]  So let's talk briefly here about the vegetative stage of growth and why I feel veg is often
[24:21.860 --> 24:24.340]  overlooked and super duper.
[24:24.340 --> 24:26.900]  I don't think I've said super duper since I was a kid.
[24:26.900 --> 24:34.180]  It's super duper important to have a solid veg strategy, a solid veg space, a solid veg
[24:34.180 --> 24:39.300]  feeding regimen, a good vegetative goal, a strategy.
[24:39.300 --> 24:42.060]  All of that is under the word strategy is what I started with.
[24:42.060 --> 24:45.120]  The veg is way important and people completely forget about that.
[24:45.120 --> 24:50.320]  The vegetative stage is where we are working on healthy roots.
[24:50.320 --> 24:52.480]  Healthy roots is where we get healthy fruits.
[24:52.480 --> 24:56.100]  If you don't have healthy plants on the bottom, you can't get healthy plants up top.
[24:56.100 --> 24:57.960]  So we're working on healthy roots.
[24:57.960 --> 25:03.620]  We're working on general basic plant health so that when we start packing on weight, these
[25:03.620 --> 25:04.900]  plants are ready.
[25:04.900 --> 25:08.760]  When we start putting them under 1212 and things start going haywire and their hormonal
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.480]  systems, they can transfer nice and smoothly.
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.540]  If they are hit by a pest or something in flower, we want them super strong in veg so
[25:15.540 --> 25:17.400]  that they are ready for this.
[25:17.400 --> 25:20.980]  So this is the foundation of everything.
[25:20.980 --> 25:24.180]  Do you want your plants to go to flower looking like me?
[25:24.180 --> 25:25.380]  I'm tall and skinny.
[25:25.380 --> 25:28.580]  I'm six foot five and like 180 pounds.
[25:28.580 --> 25:32.580]  Or do you want your plants going to flower looking like Brock Lesnar?
[25:32.580 --> 25:35.640]  He's like six two and like fucking 280 bro.
[25:35.640 --> 25:41.340]  He could pick me up, snap me in half, eat part of me and store rest of me for later.
[25:42.200 --> 25:46.560]  So would you rather have your plants go into flower looking like this or looking like this?
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.120]  And there's still not much there when I do that, but you see what I'm trying to do, right?
[25:50.120 --> 25:53.520]  Would you rather have them looking like this pin or looking like my wrist, which still
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.680]  I know not much difference, but that is up to you.
[25:56.680 --> 26:01.280]  And that all happens in the vegetative stage of your growth.
[26:01.280 --> 26:07.400]  Shaping, topping, popping, twisting, bottoming, lollipopping.
[26:07.400 --> 26:11.000]  These are all things that should start in the vegetative growth.
[26:11.020 --> 26:15.100]  If you're going to put your plants in a trellis and net them out, that should happen in the
[26:15.100 --> 26:17.300]  vegetative growth stage.
[26:17.300 --> 26:20.900]  People are forgetting to do a lot of things in veg.
[26:20.900 --> 26:27.180]  Lack of work in veg creates shit plants in flower, shit shaped plants in flower, struggle
[26:27.180 --> 26:31.460]  buds in flower, buds that are too tall, buds that are floppy.
[26:31.460 --> 26:35.700]  One bud that's way up here, one bud that's way over here, one bud that's way this tall.
[26:35.700 --> 26:39.420]  So your light's got to be way up here and you got these little buds down here that aren't
[26:39.440 --> 26:42.640]  getting a lot of light, but these couple of buds are sticking up way close to the light
[26:42.640 --> 26:44.440]  and you're freaking out.
[26:44.440 --> 26:49.000]  Veg is where we can fix and prevent and prepare for all of these problems.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.080]  So shape them in veg, pop them, twist them, bend them down, get them the structure that
[26:54.080 --> 26:56.920]  you want, the strength and vigor that you want.
[26:56.920 --> 26:58.640]  Prepare them in the vegetative stage.
[26:58.640 --> 27:02.560]  Set yourself up for success before we go into flower.
[27:02.560 --> 27:08.840]  Also any mistake you make in the veg phase prolongs your flowering stage.
[27:08.860 --> 27:11.260]  I like to correct any problems before I go to flower.
[27:11.260 --> 27:16.020]  I don't like to go into flower with problems because you can't spray, you can't do as many
[27:16.020 --> 27:18.340]  things to the plants once you're into flower.
[27:18.340 --> 27:24.100]  So I need my issues of the room, of the grow in my life, I need all of the problems resolved
[27:24.100 --> 27:26.660]  before we go into the flowering phase.
[27:26.660 --> 27:30.940]  So if you've got an issue in veg, you got to correct that shit quickly, get your plants
[27:30.940 --> 27:31.940]  back on track.
[27:31.940 --> 27:38.100]  Now, not only are you lacking growth and performance and vigor from the plants, potential, that
[27:38.120 --> 27:41.760]  is potential potency, harvest weight of what you're going to get in the end because you're
[27:41.760 --> 27:43.200]  fucked up in the veg phase.
[27:43.200 --> 27:44.440]  You got to correct that.
[27:44.440 --> 27:45.720]  You've got to recover.
[27:45.720 --> 27:47.120]  Now you're also behind.
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.540]  You're probably minimum a week to two weeks behind from any fucking problem that happens
[27:52.540 --> 27:53.540]  in your growth.
[27:53.540 --> 27:57.080]  You get spider mites, it's going to take you a solid two weeks to get rid of them, another
[27:57.080 --> 27:59.840]  week to recover, another week to get back on track.
[27:59.840 --> 28:03.700]  Now you're fucking four weeks behind in your grow because you weren't taking good enough
[28:03.700 --> 28:06.960]  care of the vegetative stage.
[28:06.980 --> 28:09.700]  That is where the preventative pest management happens.
[28:09.700 --> 28:12.260]  That's where all of the shaping and structuring happens.
[28:12.260 --> 28:13.820]  That's where root development happens.
[28:13.820 --> 28:18.660]  This is where all of the planning should take place because this is the foundation, the
[28:18.660 --> 28:22.980]  structure, the infrastructure for the future plants that we are growing.
[28:22.980 --> 28:26.300]  Do you want to grow struggle buds or do you want to grow big fat donkey dicks?
[28:26.300 --> 28:30.420]  Do you want one big bud that's touching the light with a bunch of shit at the bottom or
[28:30.420 --> 28:36.140]  do you want a nice canopy, an even row of buds that fills the entire room with a nice
[28:36.140 --> 28:40.700]  airflow, beautiful fucking, everything is clean and organized.
[28:40.700 --> 28:45.660]  That's up to you, but it starts, it starts at day one of the vet.
[28:45.660 --> 28:47.260]  It starts from the day you cut that clone.
[28:47.260 --> 28:50.020]  It starts when you start thinking about the room.
[28:50.020 --> 28:52.820]  Let me segue in to that one.
[28:52.820 --> 28:54.180]  The room.
[28:54.180 --> 28:59.720]  People don't spend enough money, attention, time and details and effort on their vegetative
[28:59.720 --> 29:02.020]  stage in their vegetative room.
[29:02.020 --> 29:03.020]  I'm sorry.
[29:03.020 --> 29:06.580]  Do you think they can just hang up a light and they've got a bedroom?
[29:06.580 --> 29:08.100]  In some cases that will work.
[29:08.100 --> 29:09.820]  Do you have a fan in there?
[29:09.820 --> 29:11.140]  Are you controlling the humidity?
[29:11.140 --> 29:13.060]  Are you controlling the temperature in that room?
[29:13.060 --> 29:17.700]  Do you have something, some sort of duct that pulls old air out and moves it out the humidity?
[29:17.700 --> 29:20.100]  Do you have something that brings in fresh air?
[29:20.100 --> 29:23.640]  Do you need or have a humidifier or dehumidifier?
[29:23.640 --> 29:26.260]  Is your bedroom setting you up for success?
[29:26.260 --> 29:28.660]  You spent all, I know you spent a bunch of money.
[29:28.660 --> 29:32.580]  You spent like 90% of your money on the flowering room, didn't you?
[29:32.580 --> 29:34.180]  You got the best lights.
[29:34.180 --> 29:35.660]  You got the best soil.
[29:35.660 --> 29:37.100]  You got the best fucking pots.
[29:37.100 --> 29:38.480]  You got the best timer.
[29:38.480 --> 29:41.020]  You got that thing on the wall that all the lights plug into.
[29:41.020 --> 29:43.340]  It's got the best programmable shit on it.
[29:43.340 --> 29:46.320]  You got your PL minder unit or your pulse monitor.
[29:46.320 --> 29:48.260]  You got your CO2 setup going on.
[29:48.260 --> 29:50.800]  You got it all cranking in the flower room, right?
[29:50.800 --> 29:52.380]  But you didn't spend shit in the bedroom.
[29:52.380 --> 29:55.360]  So by the time you get to that flower room, those plants are wonky.
[29:55.360 --> 30:01.140]  They're all fucking unevenly shaped and fucking look like Charlie Brown's Christmas tree because
[30:01.380 --> 30:05.740]  people don't spend enough time, effort, energy, money, effort.
[30:05.740 --> 30:07.020]  That's the bottom line.
[30:07.020 --> 30:08.180]  Effort and strategy.
[30:08.180 --> 30:10.740]  There's no strategy happening in the bedroom.
[30:10.740 --> 30:15.060]  So you end up with weak light, not the right light.
[30:15.060 --> 30:16.260]  Lights of the wrong spectrum.
[30:16.260 --> 30:19.900]  Lights that are way too high or way too low from your plants.
[30:19.900 --> 30:24.840]  I see bedrooms that are way too overpacked because they were poorly planned.
[30:24.840 --> 30:28.660]  There's not enough room for mother plants, for flowering or for vegetative plants, for
[30:28.660 --> 30:31.220]  clones, for shit that needs to be transplanted.
[30:31.220 --> 30:32.700]  They get way too packed in there.
[30:32.700 --> 30:34.780]  They start getting tall and stretchy.
[30:34.780 --> 30:36.460]  Starts getting too humid in there.
[30:36.460 --> 30:38.140]  Start getting powdery mildew.
[30:38.140 --> 30:40.220]  Start getting lazy because they're too packed in.
[30:40.220 --> 30:41.820]  Start getting spider mites.
[30:41.820 --> 30:45.460]  The plants start going into flower and pre-flowering because they're too packed in.
[30:45.460 --> 30:46.860]  Now your clones look like shit.
[30:46.860 --> 30:49.300]  Your next round of veg plants look like shit.
[30:49.300 --> 30:52.300]  It all starts becoming a really quick fucking struggle.
[30:52.300 --> 30:55.500]  And it just takes a week of falling behind for all this shit to happen.
[30:55.500 --> 30:57.020]  So prep your bedroom.
[30:57.020 --> 30:58.660]  Have a really nice bedroom.
[30:58.660 --> 31:01.220]  Or I see people with their plants way too far apart.
[31:01.220 --> 31:03.020]  A lot of wasted space in there.
[31:03.020 --> 31:04.980]  They're just wasting money because the lights are running.
[31:04.980 --> 31:10.060]  If you got like, if you set up your bedroom to have two lights for when you have 24 big
[31:10.060 --> 31:13.380]  plants, and right now you've got 24 cups, turn off that second light.
[31:13.380 --> 31:16.820]  Move those fucking plants under the one light and quit wasting so much space.
[31:16.820 --> 31:17.820]  You guys, come on.
[31:17.820 --> 31:20.620]  There's so many things you can do to set yourself up for success.
[31:20.620 --> 31:24.260]  I see plants way too far apart, way too close together.
[31:24.260 --> 31:29.300]  Another thing that breaks my heart is filthy, filthy grow rooms.
[31:29.300 --> 31:31.020]  Sometimes I'm guilty of this.
[31:31.020 --> 31:33.680]  Sometimes it takes me a day or two to get my shit together and get everything caught
[31:33.680 --> 31:34.880]  up and cleaned.
[31:34.880 --> 31:36.940]  But it doesn't stay filthy.
[31:36.940 --> 31:41.740]  I see people with just grow rooms that were never even built to be clean or just never
[31:41.740 --> 31:45.820]  even thought about how sanitation could affect the quality of their product.
[31:45.820 --> 31:48.980]  I'm not sure why I keep getting spider mites and fungus gnats and I go to look at your
[31:48.980 --> 31:53.620]  grow and it's like in a shed with a door that doesn't seal and the fucking bark is peeling
[31:53.620 --> 31:57.420]  off the tree and falling off the tree through the ceiling into your grow space.
[31:57.420 --> 31:59.780]  There's all kinds of weird shit that I've seen in grows.
[31:59.780 --> 32:01.340]  You guys clean up just a little bit.
[32:01.340 --> 32:02.940]  Take some pride in your grow.
[32:02.940 --> 32:05.540]  Take some pride in your work and those plants will show you.
[32:05.540 --> 32:06.820]  They'll be like, oh daddy, thank you.
[32:06.820 --> 32:09.620]  Or maybe even mommy, thank you for taking such good care of us.
[32:09.620 --> 32:11.400]  We're going to make you so proud.
[32:11.400 --> 32:13.540]  You got to go in there and take care of that veg space.
[32:13.540 --> 32:20.460]  So the veg space is just as important, if not more important than your flowering space.
[32:20.460 --> 32:22.500]  How long are your flowering lights on?
[32:22.740 --> 32:24.980]  12 hours a day, right?
[32:24.980 --> 32:26.660]  Plants are sleeping for 12 hours.
[32:26.660 --> 32:28.500]  How long are your lights on in veg?
[32:28.500 --> 32:31.500]  16, 18, 20 hours a day?
[32:31.500 --> 32:36.340]  Why wouldn't you spend enough effort, money, time, energy on making that a super fresh
[32:36.340 --> 32:38.500]  place for your plants to be also?
[32:38.500 --> 32:40.720]  We need both rooms to be ideal.
[32:40.720 --> 32:45.540]  Don't blow the whole budget, the whole wad on making a Ferrari of a flowering room if
[32:45.540 --> 32:48.820]  you're going to roll around in a pinto of a veg space.
[32:48.820 --> 32:51.580]  Maybe get two, I'm trying to find cars that are right in the middle.
[32:51.660 --> 32:52.660]  Get you two Teslas.
[32:52.660 --> 32:58.060]  Now we got a Tesla automated veg space, Tesla automated flowering space.
[32:58.060 --> 33:02.260]  Somebody's going to send me fucking hate mail, YouTube comments, why I chose Tesla.
[33:02.260 --> 33:03.260]  It's the one I chose.
[33:03.260 --> 33:06.660]  I was driving in Denver and saw a lot of Teslas recently.
[33:06.660 --> 33:07.660]  Don't get on me.
[33:07.660 --> 33:09.300]  We all got to say some kind of words, right?
[33:09.300 --> 33:11.340]  You talk for a while and don't get some criticism.
[33:11.340 --> 33:13.460]  You guys, this was a fun episode.
[33:13.460 --> 33:15.240]  Coach Steve, thank you for the great episode.
[33:15.240 --> 33:17.580]  Thank you for the great question, the great email.
[33:17.580 --> 33:20.380]  Thank you for inspiring a nice rant about vegetative growth.
[33:20.380 --> 33:21.860]  I do appreciate it.
[33:21.860 --> 33:27.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[33:27.500 --> 33:33.900]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, commercial cultivators, home growers, closet tokers,
[33:33.900 --> 33:37.240]  and heavy dabbers, I want to thank each and every one of you for listening to the Grow
[33:37.240 --> 33:38.300]  From Your Heart podcast.

[33:42.660 --> 33:44.860]  a lot of fun being on other people's podcasts.
[33:44.860 --> 33:46.700]  I hung out on Embracing Organics last night.
[33:46.700 --> 33:48.060]  That was a really good time.
[33:48.060 --> 33:49.720]  I do my show on Monday.
[33:49.720 --> 33:53.440]  My audience, my group, my friends, you guys have become my friends during COVID.
[33:53.440 --> 33:54.440]  You guys are fucking great.
[33:54.440 --> 33:55.800]  I really enjoy hanging out with you.
[33:55.800 --> 34:00.160]  I hope you are getting as much from this as I am because it is very fulfilling.
[34:00.160 --> 34:01.920]  The relationship has been going very well.
