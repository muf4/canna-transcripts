[00:01.470 --> 00:24.360]  It's time for episode number 167 of the Grower From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.360 --> 00:25.360]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.360 --> 00:26.360]  That's right.
[00:26.360 --> 00:30.920]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:30.920 --> 00:34.680]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:34.680 --> 00:38.480]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.480 --> 00:40.920]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.920 --> 00:43.120]  I want to thank you guys once again for joining me.
[00:43.120 --> 00:46.080]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.080 --> 00:48.840]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.840 --> 00:51.840]  Big shout out to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:51.840 --> 00:53.800]  Oh, I almost got through that whole thing without coughing.
[00:53.800 --> 00:55.120]  I had to cough right in the middle there.
[00:55.120 --> 00:56.120]  You guys did not hear it.
[00:56.120 --> 00:57.600]  I could have snuck that through.
[00:57.600 --> 01:02.320]  Oh man, good coughs, but shout out to my buddy Frosty Organics for bringing some frosty gorilla
[01:02.320 --> 01:03.320]  glue over here.
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.320]  Dude, that was delicious.
[01:04.320 --> 01:05.320]  Yes, yes, yes, man.
[01:05.320 --> 01:06.320]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:06.320 --> 01:07.320]  Welcome to the podcast, bro.
[01:07.320 --> 01:08.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[01:08.320 --> 01:12.480]  A newcomer, someone who has not been on yet, but I promised him our no-till guest is here.
[01:12.480 --> 01:14.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, Frosty Organics on Instagram.
[01:14.720 --> 01:15.720]  Make sure you give him a follow.
[01:15.720 --> 01:16.720]  Dude, welcome to the show.
[01:16.720 --> 01:17.720]  Thank you.
[01:17.720 --> 01:18.720]  Thank you.
[01:18.720 --> 01:20.920]  I'm super happy to be here.
[01:20.920 --> 01:22.640]  Been waiting to be on here for a little bit.
[01:22.640 --> 01:26.360]  I've been listening to this for a few years now, so.
[01:26.360 --> 01:30.440]  Yeah, I said show up and I said message me and we can have you show up.
[01:30.440 --> 01:32.800]  And the minute that episode came out, you sent me a message on Instagram.
[01:32.800 --> 01:34.160]  You're like, hey dude, I want to be on the show.
[01:34.160 --> 01:35.160]  Let's get this together.
[01:35.160 --> 01:36.160]  Yeah, I was super pumped.
[01:36.160 --> 01:37.160]  Hell yeah.
[01:37.200 --> 01:38.200]  So welcome to the show.
[01:38.200 --> 01:39.200]  Glad to have you here.
[01:39.200 --> 01:41.240]  We're going to talk about no-till, obviously, today, you guys.
[01:41.240 --> 01:44.520]  I've got to introduce another newcomer sitting across from me.
[01:44.520 --> 01:47.120]  This guy is visiting from, are you visiting from North Carolina?
[01:47.120 --> 01:48.120]  Yeah, totally.
[01:48.120 --> 01:50.600]  He's sharing a mic with Will, so he's going to have to kind of lean in a little bit, but
[01:50.600 --> 01:51.600]  he's visiting from North Carolina.
[01:51.600 --> 01:52.600]  Welcome to the show.
[01:52.600 --> 01:53.600]  Our new friend, I want to say Logan, right?
[01:53.600 --> 01:54.600]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:54.600 --> 01:55.600]  Nice.
[01:55.600 --> 01:56.600]  I just told your name once and I remembered it.
[01:56.600 --> 01:57.600]  Yeah, totally.
[01:57.600 --> 01:58.600]  Jeff, is that your name?
[01:58.600 --> 01:59.600]  Yes, yes, yes.
[01:59.600 --> 02:00.600]  Nice.
[02:00.600 --> 02:01.600]  Frosty Jeff.
[02:01.600 --> 02:02.600]  Very good to meet you, brother.
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.600]  You're in from North Carolina, right?
[02:03.600 --> 02:04.600]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:05.040 --> 02:06.040]  Legal there, is it?
[02:06.040 --> 02:07.040]  No, not at all.
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.600]  Is this some culture shock to be able to come out here and just drive around with weed in
[02:09.600 --> 02:10.600]  the car?
[02:10.600 --> 02:18.760]  Well, honestly, I've been smoking since a very young age with old Will over here, actually.
[02:18.760 --> 02:23.960]  It's nothing weird to me, because the taboo is broken for myself, but to be out here,
[02:23.960 --> 02:26.200]  it's so much more comfortable.
[02:26.200 --> 02:30.240]  There's always this looming, impending doom, but North Carolina is actually decriminalized,
[02:30.240 --> 02:31.240]  too.
[02:31.240 --> 02:35.000]  If you get pulled over with weed and you're not acting like a total jackass, you're probably
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  going to be all right.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  You'll probably get that ticket.
[02:37.000 --> 02:42.040]  It's going to cost like, I don't know, $250 to $500, but it's going to suck.
[02:42.040 --> 02:43.040]  Better than going to jail.
[02:43.040 --> 02:46.840]  Yeah, it's better than going to jail, but you never know what's going to happen.
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.840]  Nice, nice.
[02:47.840 --> 02:48.840]  Thanks for joining us on the podcast, bro.
[02:48.840 --> 02:49.840]  Yeah, totally.
[02:49.840 --> 02:52.120]  If you feel like taking a dab or anything, man, reach over, grab any of the Shatter,
[02:52.120 --> 02:53.120]  any of the rigs.
[02:53.120 --> 02:54.120]  It's all available.
[02:54.120 --> 02:55.120]  I'd love to.
[02:55.120 --> 02:56.120]  I'm about to load one up.
[02:56.120 --> 02:57.120]  There you go, bro.
[02:57.120 --> 02:58.120]  Here's a dab.
[02:58.120 --> 03:00.040]  Actually, here's a dab on this dabber if you want to take that man-sized dab.
[03:00.040 --> 03:01.040]  Don't hurt yourself or do.
[03:01.040 --> 03:02.040]  All right.
[03:02.040 --> 03:03.040]  You guys heard me mention him.
[03:03.040 --> 03:04.040]  I'm trying so hard not to cough, you guys.
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.320]  We've been taking mad dabs over here.
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.160]  Our friend from Barefoot Extracts, also the Barefoot Growers across the table from me.
[03:12.160 --> 03:13.160]  Welcome, Barefoot.
[03:13.160 --> 03:14.160]  Hey, thanks for having me.
[03:14.160 --> 03:15.160]  Should we call you Will?
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.160]  Call you Barefoot.
[03:16.160 --> 03:17.160]  Barefoot Will, whatever you want to call me.
[03:17.160 --> 03:18.160]  That beard is coming in manly.
[03:18.160 --> 03:19.160]  Oh, appreciate it, man.
[03:19.160 --> 03:20.160]  I've been getting a lot of compliments on it lately.
[03:20.160 --> 03:21.160]  It's kind of funny.
[03:21.160 --> 03:22.160]  Did you trim it up?
[03:22.160 --> 03:23.160]  Did you even it out or something?
[03:23.160 --> 03:24.160]  Yeah, every couple weeks I'll go through and kind of hit it.
[03:24.160 --> 03:25.160]  Just kind of get the loose ones.
[03:25.160 --> 03:26.160]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:26.160 --> 03:27.160]  Give it a thickness, bro.
[03:27.160 --> 03:28.160]  It's manly now.
[03:28.160 --> 03:29.160]  You're about to raid some villages or something.
[03:29.160 --> 03:30.160]  I just might.
[03:30.160 --> 03:31.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:31.160 --> 03:32.160]  Awesome.
[03:32.160 --> 03:33.160]  You guys, we're going to talk about no-till, but before we get that far, I want to thank
[03:33.160 --> 03:34.160]  these guys for joining me because they've been here for like an hour and 20 minutes
[03:34.160 --> 03:35.160]  and all we've done is take dabs and bullshit.
[03:35.160 --> 03:36.160]  So thanks for taking time out of your evening.
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.160]  Just ripped a water bottle at me like, I'm having fun.
[03:37.160 --> 03:38.160]  Don't worry.
[03:38.160 --> 03:39.160]  Thanks for joining me.
[03:39.160 --> 03:40.160]  I know you got kids, dude, so thanks for coming over.
[03:40.160 --> 03:41.160]  Everybody's got a garden and a life, so thanks for joining me.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.160]  Also, I need to give a huge shout out to my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend,
[03:42.160 --> 03:43.160]  my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend, my friend,
[03:57.320 --> 04:04.160]  if you need some new, uh, genetics for your garden, some feminized or regular seeds, check
[04:04.160 --> 04:06.060]  out the dank team.com.
[04:06.060 --> 04:09.400]  Let them know that you heard about them on the grow from your heart podcast.
[04:09.400 --> 04:12.120]  Also shout out to our friends at handmade apparel.
[04:12.120 --> 04:14.080]  That's some cool shit coming up from our friends at handmade.
[04:14.080 --> 04:15.080]  Just want to give them a shout out.
[04:15.080 --> 04:19.800]  And also I owe a huge shout out to my friend, task rock at highly educated titanium.
[04:19.800 --> 04:21.220]  Uh, the other day I went to the mailbox.
[04:21.220 --> 04:22.220]  I didn't feel good.
[04:22.220 --> 04:23.220]  I didn't feel worth a shit.
[04:23.220 --> 04:24.220]  I ate something that kicked my ass.
[04:24.220 --> 04:27.100]  Man, I was not living but I went to the mailbox
[04:27.100 --> 04:29.520]  and I opened up the mail and there was a gift in the mail
[04:29.520 --> 04:32.480]  from Task Rock and Highly Educated Titanium.
[04:32.480 --> 04:36.680]  I got the new, it's a quartz and titanium combo
[04:37.520 --> 04:39.640]  domeless e-nail, of course domeless, right?
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.680]  I still say domeless, that's like a thing.
[04:41.680 --> 04:42.520]  Back in the day, you guys,
[04:42.520 --> 04:44.820]  we used to put a dome on the dab rig.
[04:44.820 --> 04:47.940]  But it's a titanium nail with a quartz dish
[04:47.940 --> 04:51.040]  with a little protective titanium shroud,
[04:51.040 --> 04:52.620]  I think is the appropriate word.
[04:52.620 --> 04:54.300]  It's got like a shield around it
[04:54.300 --> 04:56.700]  so that you can carry your quartz nail with you
[04:56.700 --> 04:58.660]  and you don't have to feel as paranoid
[04:58.660 --> 05:00.860]  like you're gonna break it because I'm a breaky guy.
[05:00.860 --> 05:04.320]  I like to break glass shit and I will break a quartz nail.
[05:04.320 --> 05:06.740]  So now I've got a quartz nail that I will not break.
[05:06.740 --> 05:10.820]  It is able to be attached to my barrel style e-nail coil.
[05:10.820 --> 05:13.920]  I like it much better on my flat e-nail coil
[05:13.920 --> 05:16.860]  and it's also able to be used without the e-nail setup
[05:16.860 --> 05:18.940]  as just an on-the-go nail.
[05:18.940 --> 05:21.080]  So big shout out to Task, thank you.
[05:21.080 --> 05:22.220]  That's a sweet product.
[05:22.740 --> 05:24.660]  I think I like it a lot better with the flat coil.
[05:24.660 --> 05:28.140]  I think it's going to end up being used mostly with a torch.
[05:28.140 --> 05:29.940]  I didn't like it as much with the barrel coil.
[05:29.940 --> 05:31.820]  It didn't heat up the way I wanted it to heat up.
[05:31.820 --> 05:32.780]  I take globs, you guys.
[05:32.780 --> 05:35.100]  It would work for you probably.
[05:35.100 --> 05:37.220]  But everybody over here was like, your nail is hot.
[05:37.220 --> 05:38.060]  They're all making this,
[05:38.060 --> 05:39.480]  everybody that hit my e-nail is looking at me like,
[05:39.480 --> 05:41.580]  your fucking nail is hot, my throat hurts.
[05:41.580 --> 05:43.540]  But big shout out to those guys.
[05:43.540 --> 05:45.620]  All right, let's talk about some no-till.
[05:45.620 --> 05:47.980]  Last time Will was here and he kind of led on
[05:47.980 --> 05:49.540]  a little bit about no-till growing.
[05:49.540 --> 05:51.200]  And I said, elaborate, and he said,
[05:51.200 --> 05:52.400]  you got to get Frosty over.
[05:52.400 --> 05:54.000]  So we've got Frosty Organics over.
[05:54.000 --> 05:55.540]  We're going to talk about no-till.
[05:55.540 --> 05:57.800]  I should ask Frosty a couple of questions
[05:57.800 --> 05:58.680]  before we do that, bro.
[05:58.680 --> 06:00.640]  How long have you been growing cannabis?
[06:02.600 --> 06:05.800]  Really, really growing, like for real growing.
[06:06.940 --> 06:08.800]  I'd say a little over two years.
[06:08.800 --> 06:09.640]  Oh shit.
[06:09.640 --> 06:11.800]  So you've just been getting at this and you're good at it.
[06:11.800 --> 06:14.160]  Yeah, probably closer to three years.
[06:14.160 --> 06:19.120]  But you know, like really figuring out what I was doing
[06:19.120 --> 06:24.120]  and doing it correctly, I'd say about two years.
[06:24.400 --> 06:27.160]  Okay, how long into your grow career
[06:27.160 --> 06:28.720]  did you decide to go no-till?
[06:30.320 --> 06:33.600]  Probably a year.
[06:33.600 --> 06:35.440]  Okay, so you've been at the no-till for like a year.
[06:35.440 --> 06:36.280]  A year.
[06:36.280 --> 06:37.120]  All right, and you're good at it, bro,
[06:37.120 --> 06:38.680]  because that Gorilla Glue 4 you brought.
[06:38.680 --> 06:39.520]  Oh yeah.
[06:39.520 --> 06:41.160]  That is frosty as shit, it lives up to your name.
[06:41.160 --> 06:42.640]  My soil's good at it.
[06:42.640 --> 06:43.800]  Okay, all right.
[06:43.800 --> 06:46.760]  Ooh, oh, I like the way this guy thinks.
[06:46.760 --> 06:49.080]  So you're making, where'd you get your soil recipe?
[06:50.080 --> 06:55.080]  There's a guy that I've been following for a while.
[06:55.360 --> 06:59.080]  His name is Koot on Instagram.
[06:59.080 --> 06:59.920]  Okay.
[06:59.920 --> 07:00.760]  Clackamascuskoot.
[07:00.760 --> 07:01.580]  Clackamaskoot.
[07:01.580 --> 07:02.840]  Clackamaskoot's old school.
[07:02.840 --> 07:03.760]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:03.760 --> 07:05.200]  Clackamaskoot's old school.
[07:05.200 --> 07:06.040]  When you said Koot,
[07:06.040 --> 07:07.440]  I thought that might be who you're talking about.
[07:07.440 --> 07:08.840]  He's really into like K and F,
[07:08.840 --> 07:11.800]  like Korean natural farming.
[07:11.800 --> 07:12.640]  Yeah.
[07:12.640 --> 07:13.460]  You know, and stuff like that.
[07:13.460 --> 07:17.480]  So we really, everybody I think that does no-till
[07:17.560 --> 07:20.120]  is like basically based off of his soil recipe.
[07:20.120 --> 07:21.160]  Okay.
[07:21.160 --> 07:22.640]  We took his soil recipe
[07:22.640 --> 07:25.240]  and then just added our own things into it,
[07:25.240 --> 07:27.980]  but he's really like the founder of no-till.
[07:27.980 --> 07:29.120]  Nice, okay.
[07:30.080 --> 07:31.960]  So since we're talking about who the founder is,
[07:31.960 --> 07:33.920]  tell us a little about what's the difference
[07:33.920 --> 07:36.240]  between no-till and what most of us are probably doing.
[07:36.240 --> 07:38.120]  Most of us are probably going to the store,
[07:38.120 --> 07:40.220]  getting bottles, mixing shit up in a shot glass,
[07:40.220 --> 07:42.040]  weighing it out into a bucket,
[07:42.040 --> 07:42.980]  pouring it in, mixing it up,
[07:42.980 --> 07:43.960]  making sure the pH is right,
[07:43.960 --> 07:45.760]  and then pouring that onto our plants.
[07:45.760 --> 07:47.140]  So teach us a little about the difference
[07:47.820 --> 07:48.660]  of what no-till is.
[07:48.660 --> 07:52.900]  Well, no-till is just basically kind of like living soil.
[07:52.900 --> 07:55.820]  Living soil is basically a super soil that everybody's doing.
[07:55.820 --> 07:57.380]  So everybody got into an organic way
[07:57.380 --> 07:59.260]  and they're like, well, you can feed, you know,
[07:59.260 --> 08:01.460]  just water to this soil
[08:01.460 --> 08:03.480]  and your plants will do what it's supposed to.
[08:03.480 --> 08:07.400]  So basically all the inputs in your soil
[08:07.400 --> 08:09.840]  is doing what it's supposed to for you.
[08:11.220 --> 08:12.460]  So like in nature,
[08:12.460 --> 08:14.500]  you don't see anything in nature
[08:14.500 --> 08:16.020]  doesn't get fed with a bottle.
[08:16.020 --> 08:17.700]  It's already in the dirt
[08:17.700 --> 08:19.300]  and it eats it as it's supposed to
[08:19.300 --> 08:20.900]  and get what it wants.
[08:20.900 --> 08:22.060]  It breaks it down naturally
[08:22.060 --> 08:23.620]  because the decomposition happens
[08:23.620 --> 08:25.020]  from other things in the earth
[08:25.020 --> 08:28.020]  and the worms and poop.
[08:28.020 --> 08:30.820]  And so then that's available as needed by the plant
[08:30.820 --> 08:32.780]  and the plant isn't force fed basically
[08:32.780 --> 08:34.780]  or starving for anything, hopefully.
[08:34.780 --> 08:35.700]  Yeah. Right. Okay.
[08:35.700 --> 08:38.980]  And so I was doing super soil there for a while.
[08:38.980 --> 08:39.860]  Super soil is okay.
[08:39.860 --> 08:42.160]  Sometimes your soil is too hot.
[08:42.160 --> 08:44.480]  They put too many amendments in it
[08:44.480 --> 08:47.960]  or maybe the amendments that are in there
[08:47.960 --> 08:49.200]  for deep in flower,
[08:49.200 --> 08:52.200]  because you might've put your soil together a little bit
[08:52.200 --> 08:54.040]  before you threw it into flour, you know,
[08:54.040 --> 08:55.320]  late in veg or something like that.
[08:55.320 --> 08:56.840]  You might've transplanted to your five gallon
[08:56.840 --> 08:58.920]  right before you threw it into flour.
[08:58.920 --> 09:02.040]  You might start getting too heavy of newts, you know,
[09:02.040 --> 09:05.720]  or I guess natural amendments being broken down
[09:05.720 --> 09:07.640]  and feeding your plants too hot
[09:07.640 --> 09:09.040]  and it'll burn your plants.
[09:10.620 --> 09:13.020]  So I guess the way to get away from that
[09:13.300 --> 09:15.420]  is to just the natural way with no till
[09:15.420 --> 09:18.620]  is to have basically the same thing,
[09:18.620 --> 09:20.460]  but then we have like compost
[09:20.460 --> 09:23.400]  and then we have, you know, worms in there.
[09:23.400 --> 09:24.560]  I don't put worms in there.
[09:24.560 --> 09:26.220]  I just put earthworm castings
[09:27.340 --> 09:30.780]  from a guy here in town named Don.
[09:30.780 --> 09:32.300]  Don. Shout out to Don.
[09:32.300 --> 09:33.820]  The worm Don.
[09:33.820 --> 09:37.220]  Yeah. He has the greatest earthworm castings ever,
[09:37.220 --> 09:38.820]  but it has cocoons in it.
[09:38.820 --> 09:41.180]  So those worms will come to life after like,
[09:41.180 --> 09:42.940]  you know, a few days actually, you know.
[09:43.580 --> 09:45.340]  It'll have little worms in there too, you know,
[09:45.340 --> 09:47.460]  little bitty worms and stuff in there already.
[09:47.460 --> 09:49.500]  So, you know, once they start getting fed
[09:49.500 --> 09:51.900]  and stuff like that, you just need to have mulch on top.
[09:51.900 --> 09:54.580]  Cause what you want to do is you want to keep,
[09:54.580 --> 09:58.100]  basically you want to just keep your soil
[09:58.100 --> 10:00.460]  very, very moist on top,
[10:00.460 --> 10:03.060]  just because you want your worms to come to the top
[10:03.060 --> 10:05.020]  and to break down all your top dressings.
[10:05.020 --> 10:05.840]  Okay.
[10:05.840 --> 10:08.700]  So whenever you do a transplant from your one gallon,
[10:08.700 --> 10:11.140]  so usually in a one gallon, when I veg,
[10:11.140 --> 10:14.020]  I just use like some shitty soil, you know,
[10:14.020 --> 10:15.780]  something that's very base, you know,
[10:15.780 --> 10:18.140]  you could use Pro-Mix if you wanted, you know,
[10:18.140 --> 10:20.300]  I mean, if that's what you chose,
[10:20.300 --> 10:22.860]  I use more something that, you know,
[10:22.860 --> 10:26.100]  shout to Don again, Don makes a base soil for me.
[10:26.100 --> 10:28.340]  I just put my plants in there in one gallons.
[10:28.340 --> 10:30.500]  I veg them with just water only,
[10:30.500 --> 10:34.140]  just for like a month, three weeks.
[10:34.140 --> 10:36.820]  After that, I put them into their new pot
[10:36.820 --> 10:40.500]  and then I veg them for a week in their no-till pots,
[10:40.500 --> 10:42.460]  but their no-till pots are already working
[10:42.460 --> 10:44.740]  and already inoculated.
[10:44.740 --> 10:45.580]  Okay.
[10:45.580 --> 10:47.140]  So let's talk about what goes into that.
[10:47.140 --> 10:49.060]  Let's talk about what goes into that no-till pot
[10:49.060 --> 10:51.420]  before we put the plants in it.
[10:51.420 --> 10:54.620]  And how long before I put my one gallon pot
[10:54.620 --> 10:57.540]  into that no-till, do I want to get that mixed up?
[10:57.540 --> 10:59.540]  Do I need some time to let it get cooking?
[10:59.540 --> 11:00.580]  You do, for sure.
[11:00.580 --> 11:02.540]  If you want to make it on your own,
[11:02.540 --> 11:07.300]  you can buy a soil mix now that is basically Coots Mix,
[11:08.100 --> 11:10.980]  plus all the extra things we were putting in it.
[11:10.980 --> 11:14.580]  For a few years, you know, we were having to, you know,
[11:14.580 --> 11:17.300]  make our soil mixes and put all these extra things in it.
[11:17.300 --> 11:20.060]  Then we started buying like a soil mix on Build A Soil.
[11:20.060 --> 11:20.900]  Okay.
[11:20.900 --> 11:23.300]  And we'd still have to put extra things in it, you know,
[11:23.300 --> 11:25.600]  to make it exactly what you want it to be rich enough
[11:25.600 --> 11:28.060]  to be able to go all through flower and stuff like that,
[11:28.060 --> 11:29.780]  to have your worms and your microbe life
[11:29.780 --> 11:32.500]  and your beneficials really working, you know?
[11:32.500 --> 11:36.620]  And so after we, you know, we're doing that for a while,
[11:36.620 --> 11:37.780]  now he came out with a,
[11:37.780 --> 11:39.940]  it's called a Modern Mix version 2.0.
[11:39.940 --> 11:41.460]  Okay, I'm going to write that down.
[11:41.460 --> 11:45.420]  It has, what is the compost in it, Will?
[11:45.420 --> 11:46.420]  Oh, I'm not sure.
[11:46.420 --> 11:49.260]  It's from Malibu Compost.
[11:49.260 --> 11:51.100]  Okay, I've only heard good things about those guys.
[11:51.100 --> 11:52.980]  That's one of the richest compost I've ever used.
[11:52.980 --> 11:54.220]  The only thing bad I've heard about them
[11:54.220 --> 11:55.740]  is it's hard to get sometimes.
[11:55.740 --> 11:56.700]  It is very hard to get.
[11:56.700 --> 11:57.540]  All right.
[11:57.540 --> 11:58.380]  Very, very hard to get.
[11:58.380 --> 11:59.200]  Must be good shit then.
[11:59.200 --> 12:00.040]  Super good shit.
[12:00.940 --> 12:03.780]  Jeremy started making a super good soil though,
[12:03.780 --> 12:07.580]  so I've used his soil a few times now
[12:07.580 --> 12:10.700]  on a few new pots that I've had to put together
[12:10.700 --> 12:11.800]  on some new rooms,
[12:12.980 --> 12:15.700]  but all my older pots that are like four or five rounds in,
[12:15.700 --> 12:17.460]  I built those like all the way up.
[12:17.460 --> 12:20.640]  Like we mixed the compost, we mixed the soil.
[12:20.640 --> 12:23.860]  We had to, you know, mix each amendment in, you know,
[12:23.860 --> 12:26.780]  one cup to each cubic foot, you know what I'm saying?
[12:26.780 --> 12:27.620]  Okay.
[12:27.620 --> 12:28.860]  And we had to, you know, had to mix it up.
[12:28.860 --> 12:31.900]  And then I guess you'd have it sit there
[12:31.900 --> 12:33.460]  for maybe like a week or two,
[12:34.140 --> 12:35.460]  but then you would just, you know, put everything in there,
[12:35.460 --> 12:37.820]  put your top dress on there, you know,
[12:37.820 --> 12:39.860]  put your earthworm castings in there.
[12:39.860 --> 12:43.940]  You'd put your cover crop and stuff like that.
[12:43.940 --> 12:45.300]  And then just let it come to life.
[12:45.300 --> 12:46.780]  And then by the time you put your plant in there,
[12:46.780 --> 12:49.260]  it's already working and it'll just overtake your plant.
[12:49.260 --> 12:50.100]  Okay.
[12:50.100 --> 12:51.620]  So if you even put shitty soil in there,
[12:51.620 --> 12:52.620]  it'll overtake that shit.
[12:52.620 --> 12:53.460]  Right.
[12:53.460 --> 12:54.280]  Oh yeah.
[12:54.280 --> 12:55.120]  Yeah.
[12:55.120 --> 12:55.960]  Oh yeah.
[12:55.960 --> 12:56.780]  And you can start with old, shitty recycled soil, you guys.
[12:56.780 --> 12:59.420]  I like to take my old soil that plants have already been in
[12:59.420 --> 13:00.820]  and I will put clones in it.
[13:00.820 --> 13:03.140]  The clones, if you got a clone from me,
[13:03.820 --> 13:06.020]  chances are it came in recycled soil, but it was treated.
[13:06.020 --> 13:06.860]  There are no bugs in it.
[13:06.860 --> 13:07.700]  It's been flushed.
[13:07.700 --> 13:08.520]  It's happy.
[13:08.520 --> 13:09.360]  Look how good your clones look.
[13:09.360 --> 13:10.200]  Don't be mad.
[13:10.200 --> 13:11.020]  It looks good.
[13:11.020 --> 13:11.860]  All right.
[13:11.860 --> 13:12.700]  So you can start in shitty soil
[13:12.700 --> 13:13.700]  if you're going into no-till.
[13:13.700 --> 13:16.240]  So you've got it set up about a week in advance.
[13:16.240 --> 13:17.340]  Do we want to put water in there
[13:17.340 --> 13:19.140]  after we've got all the nutrients
[13:19.140 --> 13:20.860]  and all the amendments in there and the soil in there?
[13:20.860 --> 13:22.460]  Do we want to water it a week in advance
[13:22.460 --> 13:24.100]  or do you just want to let it sit kind of,
[13:24.100 --> 13:26.060]  do you want it moist or do you want it kind of dry?
[13:26.060 --> 13:26.900]  You should water it.
[13:26.900 --> 13:27.740]  Okay.
[13:27.740 --> 13:28.560]  Definitely water it.
[13:28.560 --> 13:29.400]  All right.
[13:29.400 --> 13:30.240]  So that'll get it kind of moving in there.
[13:30.240 --> 13:31.060]  Get all that going.
[13:31.060 --> 13:31.900]  Okay.
[13:32.580 --> 13:34.860]  Keep your beneficials eating and stuff like that.
[13:34.860 --> 13:37.620]  Cause whenever we put those earthworm castings in there,
[13:37.620 --> 13:39.820]  they definitely already have a lot of beneficials
[13:39.820 --> 13:42.220]  and stuff in there working with the worms.
[13:42.220 --> 13:46.760]  Cause you know, just it's so rich that that shit's so rich.
[13:46.760 --> 13:47.700]  It comes so fresh.
[13:47.700 --> 13:50.700]  He gives it to us fresh out of the compost of the worms.
[13:50.700 --> 13:51.540]  Oh nice.
[13:51.540 --> 13:52.380]  He's got it going on over there.
[13:52.380 --> 13:53.200]  Yeah.
[13:53.200 --> 13:54.040]  It sounds like it.
[13:54.040 --> 13:54.860]  I know another guy that had something similar
[13:54.860 --> 13:55.700]  and I've seen it.
[13:55.700 --> 13:56.540]  It's beautiful.
[13:56.540 --> 13:57.360]  All right.
[13:57.360 --> 13:58.200]  So you can get them loaded,
[13:58.200 --> 14:00.300]  get your pots loaded up about a week in advance.
[14:00.300 --> 14:01.940]  Check out the modern mix 2.0.
[14:01.940 --> 14:02.780]  That's a good start.
[14:02.780 --> 14:04.780]  You might want to add some stuff.
[14:04.780 --> 14:08.540]  Check out sub cools, super soil recipe.
[14:08.540 --> 14:09.620]  And it's going to be similar.
[14:09.620 --> 14:11.420]  The way he throws a tarp on the ground
[14:11.420 --> 14:13.500]  and mixes the super soil.
[14:13.500 --> 14:14.320]  It's the same idea.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.160]  What we're trying to do here.
[14:15.160 --> 14:16.660]  We're just using a different mix.
[14:16.660 --> 14:18.900]  Check out the modern mix 2.0.
[14:18.900 --> 14:22.580]  Find your own recipe on making some no-till soil
[14:22.580 --> 14:24.020]  and perfect it for your plants.
[14:24.020 --> 14:25.980]  You'll get a good start with the modern mix 2.0.
[14:25.980 --> 14:27.020]  It sounds like, but your plants
[14:27.020 --> 14:28.080]  are going to want different shit.
[14:28.080 --> 14:30.880]  You're going to need to perfect it for each plant,
[14:30.880 --> 14:32.640]  but this is a good start.
[14:32.640 --> 14:34.880]  Then get your plants into there about a week
[14:35.880 --> 14:37.420]  after you make the mix.
[14:37.420 --> 14:38.260]  Then you said mulch.
[14:38.260 --> 14:40.240]  You want to keep mulch on top to keep the worms feeding.
[14:40.240 --> 14:41.800]  What are we going to use for mulch?
[14:41.800 --> 14:44.680]  You can use old stems, old branches
[14:44.680 --> 14:46.280]  and stuff like that from old harvest.
[14:46.280 --> 14:49.000]  Can I take the leaves that I'm lollipopping?
[14:49.000 --> 14:49.840]  Oh man.
[14:49.840 --> 14:51.880]  So there's food already available for the worms.
[14:51.880 --> 14:52.720]  It's there waiting.
[14:52.720 --> 14:54.600]  You cut the cover crop as it's growing.
[14:54.600 --> 14:55.440]  Oh, okay.
[14:55.440 --> 14:57.480]  So cover crop, what am I growing as cover crop?
[14:57.480 --> 14:58.320]  Lots of clover.
[14:58.320 --> 14:59.140]  Clover.
[14:59.140 --> 14:59.980]  Comfrey, lemongrass.
[14:59.980 --> 15:01.320]  Comfrey, clover, yeah.
[15:01.320 --> 15:02.160]  Okay, shit.
[15:02.160 --> 15:04.360]  You got to think lemongrass will keep bugs away.
[15:04.360 --> 15:06.400]  So you're growing lemongrass right there.
[15:06.400 --> 15:07.840]  You know, it's keeping bugs away.
[15:07.840 --> 15:09.640]  I was going to ask about some pest management
[15:09.640 --> 15:11.240]  and no-till here in a couple of seconds,
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.440]  but it sounds like we're there.
[15:12.440 --> 15:14.680]  Lemongrass, what else can I use to keep the pests away
[15:14.680 --> 15:16.720]  on my no-till crop?
[15:16.720 --> 15:17.820]  Eucalyptus.
[15:18.920 --> 15:20.000]  Rosemary.
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.800]  Okay, those types of essential oils.
[15:21.800 --> 15:22.640]  Thyme.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.560]  Okay.
[15:23.560 --> 15:25.640]  You know, natural stuff like that.
[15:25.640 --> 15:28.000]  I don't really spray neem oil on my plants.
[15:28.000 --> 15:29.560]  I like curanja oil.
[15:29.560 --> 15:30.400]  Okay.
[15:30.400 --> 15:34.440]  Has a more milder smell and it's easier to,
[15:34.440 --> 15:35.640]  I don't know, to fuck with, you know?
[15:35.640 --> 15:36.480]  It's just easier to mix and stuff.
[15:36.480 --> 15:37.400]  Yeah, there's something about neem oil.
[15:37.400 --> 15:39.800]  When you said it, my face wrinkled up a little bit.
[15:39.800 --> 15:42.720]  There's something, if you get a tiny drop of neem oil
[15:42.720 --> 15:46.120]  on anything, it feels like I can taste it for a week.
[15:46.120 --> 15:48.080]  Like even if it gets on my hand, I can taste it.
[15:48.080 --> 15:50.400]  And I know that sounds crazy, but it doesn't go away.
[15:50.400 --> 15:52.560]  It's the most terrible flavor ever.
[15:52.560 --> 15:54.800]  But yeah, I've used plenty of neem oil on stuff.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.920]  But okay, so basically essential oils
[15:56.920 --> 15:58.200]  will help you keep your pests away.
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.760]  Grow the lemongrass in there.
[15:59.760 --> 16:02.000]  It works as cover crop and it's gonna keep some bugs out.
[16:02.000 --> 16:02.840]  That's fucking smooth.
[16:02.840 --> 16:03.680]  I like that.
[16:03.680 --> 16:04.500]  That's good thinking.
[16:04.500 --> 16:05.640]  All right, so that's the basics
[16:05.640 --> 16:06.800]  to get you started and set up.
[16:06.800 --> 16:07.840]  What else do we need to think about?
[16:07.840 --> 16:09.320]  We've got mulch, we've got cover crop.
[16:09.320 --> 16:12.280]  We've got some good hot soil to keep us cooking.
[16:12.280 --> 16:14.800]  Basically, you're just growing now, right?
[16:14.800 --> 16:16.440]  You gotta water them when they're thirsty.
[16:16.440 --> 16:18.080]  Water, do some top dresses.
[16:18.080 --> 16:19.480]  Top dresses, okay.
[16:19.480 --> 16:20.920]  What are we gonna use for top dress?
[16:20.920 --> 16:21.960]  Worm castings.
[16:21.960 --> 16:24.520]  Yeah, you're gonna do some neem meals,
[16:25.480 --> 16:26.880]  neem seed meal, sorry.
[16:26.880 --> 16:27.720]  That's a lot of words.
[16:27.720 --> 16:28.560]  Yeah, it's weird.
[16:28.560 --> 16:32.120]  A neem seed meal, kelp meal, biochar's good.
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.120]  Worm castings, some fish compost is real good.
[16:35.120 --> 16:35.960]  Okay.
[16:35.960 --> 16:36.780]  Alfalfa.
[16:36.780 --> 16:37.620]  Yeah, alfalfa meal is real good.
[16:37.620 --> 16:39.720]  Especially like right when you transplant,
[16:39.720 --> 16:41.640]  get a fresh dose of nitrogen right to them
[16:41.640 --> 16:43.520]  right when they're transplanted.
[16:43.520 --> 16:45.040]  I feel like kelp and sea products
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.520]  completely add to the flavors and aromas and density a lot.
[16:48.520 --> 16:49.360]  So, okay.
[16:49.360 --> 16:51.240]  Yeah, I do a neem and kelp tea.
[16:51.240 --> 16:52.760]  Every other watering.
[16:52.760 --> 16:56.160]  Do you ever foliar feed with your teas that you make?
[16:56.160 --> 16:57.000]  Oh yeah.
[16:57.000 --> 16:57.840]  Oh yeah, okay.
[16:57.840 --> 16:58.660]  All right.
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.680]  I mean, I don't really make teas anymore.
[17:00.680 --> 17:02.240]  It's just more about just top dressings.
[17:02.240 --> 17:04.480]  Like whenever you go into flour,
[17:04.480 --> 17:05.640]  malted barley once a week.
[17:05.640 --> 17:06.480]  Yeah.
[17:06.480 --> 17:08.160]  A lot of enzymes and stuff like that.
[17:08.160 --> 17:11.280]  Sugars, stuff like that'll make your buds real sweet.
[17:11.280 --> 17:12.640]  Make them dense up and stuff like that.
[17:12.640 --> 17:15.560]  You know, I do a lot of potassium silicate too.
[17:15.560 --> 17:16.400]  You know, during flowering.
[17:16.400 --> 17:17.720]  Yeah, what do you use?
[17:17.720 --> 17:18.960]  Adrenaline 16H.
[17:18.960 --> 17:19.780]  Okay.
[17:19.780 --> 17:20.620]  I just make my own.
[17:21.100 --> 17:23.260]  You know, liquid of it and stuff like that.
[17:23.260 --> 17:24.620]  I've been using the bottled Osa.
[17:24.620 --> 17:25.780]  Still a baby over here.
[17:25.780 --> 17:26.940]  The powder from Jeremy.
[17:26.940 --> 17:27.780]  That's where it's at.
[17:27.780 --> 17:28.600]  Okay.
[17:28.600 --> 17:29.440]  OSA 28 is good though.
[17:29.440 --> 17:30.260]  I mean, I used to use that
[17:30.260 --> 17:32.060]  whenever I was doing super soils and stuff.
[17:32.060 --> 17:34.340]  It seems like Build A Soil gets a lot of free shout outs
[17:34.340 --> 17:35.180]  on this podcast.
[17:35.180 --> 17:37.220]  They have a lot of, they've got everything you need.
[17:37.220 --> 17:38.380]  Oh, they have everything.
[17:38.380 --> 17:39.420]  You can just click on their website
[17:39.420 --> 17:40.700]  and you can literally build a soil.
[17:40.700 --> 17:42.660]  If you have a question, they've got a chart.
[17:42.660 --> 17:44.420]  He's got a regimen for everything on there.
[17:44.420 --> 17:45.260]  It's awesome.
[17:45.260 --> 17:46.220]  It's so basic.
[17:46.220 --> 17:48.660]  So, man, we can get,
[17:48.660 --> 17:50.340]  I had one of my basic questions here
[17:51.060 --> 17:51.900]  is how do we start?
[17:51.900 --> 17:52.900]  But you go get some Modern Mix 2.0
[17:52.900 --> 17:54.220]  and you get some pots filled with it
[17:54.220 --> 17:55.660]  and you water them and you grow some clones
[17:55.660 --> 17:57.020]  and then you throw it in there
[17:57.020 --> 17:57.980]  and then you pay attention.
[17:57.980 --> 18:00.360]  And then the next time you're gonna have to add amendments.
[18:00.360 --> 18:02.900]  So we've got our mulch, we've got our cover crop.
[18:02.900 --> 18:04.700]  We've taken care of our pests.
[18:04.700 --> 18:07.140]  Basically we're flushing the whole time, right?
[18:07.140 --> 18:08.380]  Sort of.
[18:08.380 --> 18:09.500]  Not flushing.
[18:09.500 --> 18:11.540]  You're basically just feeding your worms.
[18:11.540 --> 18:14.180]  So basically you're just feeding the life that's in there.
[18:14.180 --> 18:15.220]  Forget about the worms in there.
[18:15.220 --> 18:16.060]  That's so awesome.
[18:16.060 --> 18:18.720]  And so the worms are shitting, you know,
[18:18.720 --> 18:21.320]  and then the beneficials come and break down
[18:21.320 --> 18:26.320]  the worm poop and then the worm poop turns into hummus.
[18:26.400 --> 18:27.240]  Okay, all right.
[18:27.240 --> 18:29.000]  Humic acid, you know.
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.640]  Now at the end, you cut down your plant.
[18:31.640 --> 18:32.960]  It's done.
[18:32.960 --> 18:36.040]  Do you just dig a little hole next to that stock
[18:36.040 --> 18:37.840]  and put your next clone right in there?
[18:37.840 --> 18:39.160]  How are you getting it started again?
[18:39.160 --> 18:40.360]  Just rip your root ball out.
[18:40.360 --> 18:41.680]  Yeah, just rip that sucker right out.
[18:41.680 --> 18:42.520]  Okay.
[18:42.520 --> 18:43.360]  Try to get as little,
[18:43.360 --> 18:44.360]  you don't want to,
[18:44.360 --> 18:45.600]  take the root ball out, shake it.
[18:45.600 --> 18:47.720]  You want to get as little dirt out as possible.
[18:47.720 --> 18:48.560]  Okay.
[18:49.400 --> 18:50.400]  You don't want to add any new soil to it.
[18:50.400 --> 18:53.160]  You want to just keep using the same soil over and over.
[18:53.160 --> 18:55.240]  The only thing you want to add is new amendments
[18:55.240 --> 18:56.160]  and new top dresses.
[18:56.160 --> 18:57.000]  Okay.
[18:57.000 --> 18:57.840]  Compost.
[18:57.840 --> 18:58.660]  Yeah, compost and castings.
[18:58.660 --> 19:00.360]  If you needed to add more like soil
[19:00.360 --> 19:03.760]  or if you transplanted and needed to add something
[19:03.760 --> 19:04.880]  to actually transplant,
[19:04.880 --> 19:07.320]  you would just put compost and earthworm castings and stuff.
[19:07.320 --> 19:08.160]  Okay.
[19:08.160 --> 19:09.760]  Yeah, I would just fill that hole with worm castings.
[19:09.760 --> 19:11.120]  I love doing that when I transplant.
[19:11.120 --> 19:12.520]  I just put a nice layer of castings.
[19:12.520 --> 19:15.040]  I'll throw some great white shark or something in there
[19:15.040 --> 19:15.880]  and get that moving.
[19:15.880 --> 19:16.720]  Yeah.
[19:16.720 --> 19:17.560]  Okay.
[19:18.080 --> 19:19.040]  Those are really sad.
[19:19.040 --> 19:21.480]  And then what are you going to re-amend it
[19:21.480 --> 19:22.580]  with the second time?
[19:23.800 --> 19:25.400]  Worm castings, compost.
[19:25.400 --> 19:26.280]  The top dress is really good.
[19:26.280 --> 19:27.120]  More of the top dress.
[19:27.120 --> 19:28.420]  It's less of a re-amendment
[19:28.420 --> 19:30.160]  and more of just top dressing, re-feeding everything.
[19:30.160 --> 19:31.000]  Okay.
[19:31.000 --> 19:31.820]  Neem kale biochar.
[19:31.820 --> 19:32.660]  Yeah, exactly.
[19:32.660 --> 19:34.160]  Is the cover crop going to just keep growing?
[19:34.160 --> 19:35.640]  Is that like a perpetual thing now?
[19:35.640 --> 19:36.480]  Oh yeah.
[19:36.480 --> 19:38.340]  You cut it, it comes back, it's tight.
[19:38.340 --> 19:39.180]  Oh, okay.
[19:39.180 --> 19:40.000]  That's awesome.
[19:40.000 --> 19:40.840]  Yeah.
[19:40.840 --> 19:41.680]  The stuff that you cut off,
[19:41.680 --> 19:42.500]  can you throw that into a tea
[19:42.500 --> 19:44.000]  and make kind of a compost tea out of it?
[19:44.000 --> 19:45.800]  If you're using comfrey and stuff like that,
[19:45.800 --> 19:46.640]  yeah, absolutely.
[19:46.640 --> 19:49.040]  I usually use it as mulch on top of the top though.
[19:49.040 --> 19:50.840]  You guys don't go to the growth store anymore?
[19:50.840 --> 19:51.680]  No, no.
[19:51.680 --> 19:52.520]  Hardly, no.
[19:52.520 --> 19:55.240]  I mean, even if you wanted to make your own,
[19:55.240 --> 19:58.200]  basically, if you want to push your plants extra hard,
[19:58.200 --> 20:01.160]  you can use like calphos and stuff like that.
[20:01.160 --> 20:03.600]  You can make your own calcium and phosphorus.
[20:04.640 --> 20:06.760]  Yeah, it sounds like all these processes
[20:06.760 --> 20:08.240]  are super sustainable,
[20:08.240 --> 20:10.360]  especially once you get to a certain level.
[20:10.360 --> 20:13.200]  And so that's great for your soil anyway.
[20:13.200 --> 20:15.840]  You're just building your own little ecosystem
[20:15.880 --> 20:16.880]  out of dirt.
[20:16.880 --> 20:17.960]  Yeah.
[20:17.960 --> 20:19.800]  And one of the major problems of home growing
[20:19.800 --> 20:22.720]  is that when you're done, you've got all this trash.
[20:22.720 --> 20:24.840]  You've got sticks, you've got leaves,
[20:24.840 --> 20:26.560]  you've got pot, you've got dirt.
[20:26.560 --> 20:28.480]  Bottles, yeah, thanks.
[20:28.480 --> 20:30.040]  I didn't even think about the bottles.
[20:30.040 --> 20:31.240]  The bottles you could throw in the trash,
[20:31.240 --> 20:32.480]  but it's all that dirt.
[20:32.480 --> 20:34.240]  Like I grow, when I used to have,
[20:34.240 --> 20:37.080]  I had an old trap house where I would do like 20,
[20:37.080 --> 20:37.920]  how many did I do?
[20:37.920 --> 20:39.840]  I think there's 28, seven gallon pots.
[20:39.840 --> 20:41.520]  And that's a lot of soil when you're done.
[20:41.520 --> 20:43.080]  And I would have to find somewhere smooth
[20:43.080 --> 20:44.600]  to throw all that away.
[20:44.640 --> 20:45.960]  And luckily I have a friend
[20:45.960 --> 20:47.600]  who grows an outdoor vegetable garden
[20:47.600 --> 20:49.680]  and I would just have him come pick it all up in his truck
[20:49.680 --> 20:50.680]  and he would just haul it off for me
[20:50.680 --> 20:51.520]  in the middle of the night.
[20:51.520 --> 20:52.840]  But if I didn't have that hookup,
[20:52.840 --> 20:56.840]  what am I gonna do with 28, seven gallon pots worth of soil?
[20:56.840 --> 20:58.360]  You guys don't even have to worry about that.
[20:58.360 --> 21:00.920]  Your worms just go in there like, oh, you need new dirt.
[21:00.920 --> 21:02.240]  We got you covered, Brian.
[21:02.240 --> 21:04.000]  And you just keep it moving.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.360]  That's pretty sweet.
[21:05.360 --> 21:06.200]  That is pretty sweet.
[21:06.200 --> 21:08.720]  Yeah, so and then you get to throw your sticks in there
[21:08.720 --> 21:09.800]  and you're also composting.
[21:09.800 --> 21:11.640]  You guys run in a Bokashi bucket?
[21:11.640 --> 21:13.320]  No, I don't do that.
[21:13.640 --> 21:14.920]  I love my Bokashi bucket.
[21:14.920 --> 21:16.360]  I mean, you can.
[21:16.360 --> 21:19.920]  I mean, I like to make some fermentation
[21:19.920 --> 21:20.760]  and stuff like that.
[21:20.760 --> 21:25.760]  Like you can make fermented fruit and stuff like that.
[21:27.640 --> 21:28.480]  Stuff like that.
[21:28.480 --> 21:30.760]  And it's just like super beneficial for your plants.
[21:30.760 --> 21:33.160]  Sounds like you hang out with Sean a little bit.
[21:33.160 --> 21:34.040]  Permitted plant juices.
[21:34.040 --> 21:34.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[21:34.880 --> 21:36.080]  And fruit extracts and stuff.
[21:36.080 --> 21:37.080]  All right.
[21:37.080 --> 21:39.080]  Do you use a lot of aloe vera in anything you do?
[21:39.080 --> 21:40.880]  Oh yeah, you need a lot of-
[21:40.880 --> 21:42.840]  The plants love that stuff, don't they?
[21:43.280 --> 21:44.320]  And coconut.
[21:44.320 --> 21:45.200]  The coconut water.
[21:45.200 --> 21:47.160]  You need a lot of enzymes to help break down.
[21:47.160 --> 21:48.000]  Yes, yeah.
[21:48.000 --> 21:49.920]  I love drinking coconut water myself.
[21:49.920 --> 21:51.120]  I feel super hydrated.
[21:51.120 --> 21:52.720]  And I feel like if I feed that to the plants,
[21:52.720 --> 21:54.040]  they've got to feel the same way.
[21:54.040 --> 21:54.880]  Oh yeah.
[21:54.880 --> 21:55.720]  That's a great enzyme.
[21:55.720 --> 21:57.800]  That and aloe is my favorite.
[21:57.800 --> 21:59.680]  Okay, the stuff that comes out of the Bokashi bucket
[21:59.680 --> 22:00.960]  will break down all that old stuff.
[22:00.960 --> 22:02.360]  But we actually just started using that at work.
[22:02.360 --> 22:03.200]  Not out of the bucket,
[22:03.200 --> 22:05.520]  but we just started using Bokashi at work
[22:05.520 --> 22:08.520]  to help break down compost in our beds.
[22:08.520 --> 22:09.360]  Yeah, it'll speed it up.
[22:09.360 --> 22:11.720]  And it'll give you that white funk layer too.
[22:11.840 --> 22:13.560]  Oh, that beautiful mycelium layer
[22:13.560 --> 22:14.880]  that people get afraid of.
[22:14.880 --> 22:15.720]  Oh yeah.
[22:15.720 --> 22:16.560]  I've seen people-
[22:16.560 --> 22:18.080]  Yeah, my buddy, he just started growing organics.
[22:18.080 --> 22:19.120]  It was his first time ever growing.
[22:19.120 --> 22:20.520]  He decided to go in and add organics.
[22:20.520 --> 22:23.040]  And he got a nice layer of mycelium on his plants.
[22:23.040 --> 22:24.040]  And he sent me a message,
[22:24.040 --> 22:25.320]  dude, I think I fucked up.
[22:25.320 --> 22:27.000]  My plants got mold on them.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  And I was like, no dude, you're doing it perfectly.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.640]  That's exactly what you want.
[22:30.640 --> 22:32.720]  And he was like, oh, okay, now I can,
[22:32.720 --> 22:33.560]  he was like, I get it now.
[22:33.560 --> 22:35.320]  That's his mushrooms and shit.
[22:35.320 --> 22:36.160]  Yeah, yeah.
[22:36.160 --> 22:37.000]  People freak out.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.760]  I see it on Facebook or Instagram every once in a while.
[22:38.760 --> 22:40.640]  Like, oh shit, my soil's making shrooms.
[22:40.640 --> 22:41.480]  What do I do?
[22:42.240 --> 22:43.760]  And I'm like, nothing, just exactly what you're doing.
[22:43.760 --> 22:45.360]  There's just the right humidity
[22:45.360 --> 22:47.120]  and the right fucking pH in there
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.680]  to where you're growing shrooms.
[22:48.680 --> 22:50.600]  Like, yeah, that's gonna fall apart.
[22:50.600 --> 22:51.440]  Super rich.
[22:51.440 --> 22:53.320]  Yeah, it's gonna fall apart back into the soil
[22:53.320 --> 22:54.480]  and your plant's gonna eat that.
[22:54.480 --> 22:55.320]  It's gonna be awesome.
[22:55.320 --> 22:56.160]  Keep it going.
[22:56.160 --> 22:57.880]  Don't do anything differently.
[22:57.880 --> 23:00.600]  So I wrote down how cost-effective is this.
[23:00.600 --> 23:02.400]  Sounds like it's a one-time deal, right?
[23:02.400 --> 23:03.240]  Oh yeah.
[23:03.240 --> 23:04.080]  For the most part, yeah.
[23:04.080 --> 23:04.920]  I mean, like you gotta keep,
[23:04.920 --> 23:06.120]  you gotta occasionally buy more worm castings.
[23:06.120 --> 23:07.520]  You have to buy, you know,
[23:07.520 --> 23:09.160]  you might have to buy some more neem and kelp meal.
[23:09.160 --> 23:10.400]  Cause I do neem and kelp teas.
[23:10.840 --> 23:13.000]  You know, I just do those every like third watering,
[23:13.000 --> 23:13.840]  I think.
[23:13.840 --> 23:15.400]  And then as top dresses as well,
[23:15.400 --> 23:16.440]  depending on how much you're doing.
[23:16.440 --> 23:18.200]  But as far as the soil goes,
[23:18.200 --> 23:19.160]  yeah, it's basically a one,
[23:19.160 --> 23:21.340]  you're not buying seven bags of soil
[23:21.340 --> 23:22.640]  every time you need to do transplants.
[23:22.640 --> 23:23.480]  Right.
[23:23.480 --> 23:24.960]  Yeah, 28, seven gallon pots.
[23:24.960 --> 23:25.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[23:25.800 --> 23:27.240]  You know, they're just still, they're moving.
[23:27.240 --> 23:29.280]  And then you don't have to,
[23:29.280 --> 23:30.920]  it sounds like a lot of work,
[23:30.920 --> 23:32.880]  but it also sounds like it's saving me
[23:32.880 --> 23:34.080]  a whole bunch of work.
[23:34.080 --> 23:34.920]  In the long run, yeah.
[23:34.920 --> 23:36.960]  I don't have to go to the grocery store and buy bottles,
[23:36.960 --> 23:38.680]  which are expensive.
[23:39.520 --> 23:41.120]  I'm paying for the water to be shipped.
[23:41.120 --> 23:41.960]  Exactly.
[23:41.960 --> 23:42.780]  It feels like essentially,
[23:42.780 --> 23:43.840]  because I read the ingredients
[23:43.840 --> 23:44.920]  and all that shit's available
[23:44.920 --> 23:46.360]  at build a soil in a dry form.
[23:46.360 --> 23:48.240]  Well, the difference between like potassium silica,
[23:48.240 --> 23:49.080]  like we were talking,
[23:49.080 --> 23:51.820]  if you get pre-mixed potassium silica in a bottle,
[23:51.820 --> 23:53.960]  it's going to cost like, I mean, 10 times more,
[23:53.960 --> 23:55.000]  if not more than that,
[23:55.000 --> 23:58.360]  then what the bag of the powder comes in
[23:58.360 --> 24:00.360]  and you can make 10 times as much
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.640]  that comes in the bottle with that.
[24:01.640 --> 24:02.480]  It's crazy.
[24:03.720 --> 24:07.760]  Now you got me rethinking everything I do and ever done.
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.280]  You can make a gallon with 568 grams.
[24:10.280 --> 24:11.120]  Yeah, easily.
[24:11.120 --> 24:11.960]  Yeah.
[24:11.960 --> 24:13.640]  I mean, that's what it is.
[24:13.640 --> 24:15.600]  148 grams a liter.
[24:15.600 --> 24:18.200]  That's like, I mean, that's simple.
[24:18.200 --> 24:19.040]  Yeah.
[24:19.040 --> 24:19.880]  Yeah.
[24:19.880 --> 24:20.700]  Okay.
[24:20.700 --> 24:22.800]  I wish I could,
[24:22.800 --> 24:25.280]  I want to start off just like one or two pots of some stuff
[24:25.280 --> 24:26.840]  and to see if I can see what it does.
[24:26.840 --> 24:27.680]  It's fine.
[24:27.680 --> 24:28.500]  It's cool.
[24:28.500 --> 24:29.960]  And then like next to my botanic hair grow
[24:29.960 --> 24:32.160]  or whatever brand I'm using my veg bloom.
[24:32.160 --> 24:33.200]  Oh, it'll kill them.
[24:33.200 --> 24:34.360]  It'll overtake.
[24:34.360 --> 24:35.440]  You'll probably even see,
[24:35.440 --> 24:37.120]  you'll probably even see beneficials
[24:37.120 --> 24:39.000]  might even hop into your other soil.
[24:39.000 --> 24:39.840]  Oh yeah.
[24:39.840 --> 24:41.160]  If you get your other soil hopping that well,
[24:41.160 --> 24:42.000]  if it's really going,
[24:42.000 --> 24:42.820]  cause they'll want to go some,
[24:42.820 --> 24:44.480]  like they're going to want to spread out.
[24:44.480 --> 24:46.480]  They're going to want to go to where,
[24:46.480 --> 24:47.800]  you know, they're going to be needed.
[24:47.800 --> 24:48.640]  That's rad.
[24:48.640 --> 24:50.200]  So it's going to just move over to the other pots
[24:50.200 --> 24:51.840]  and be like, Oh, Hey, you look lonely.
[24:51.840 --> 24:53.580]  Let me help you get rid of some PM.
[24:53.580 --> 24:55.420]  If you have anything in there, the good,
[24:55.420 --> 24:56.920]  as Frosty always says.
[24:56.920 --> 24:57.760]  Oh yeah.
[24:57.760 --> 25:00.200]  I mean, there's, there's plenty of things.
[25:00.200 --> 25:02.720]  Lactobacillus serum.
[25:02.720 --> 25:04.240]  I had a buddy that had some other plants
[25:04.240 --> 25:05.760]  that got some PM on them.
[25:05.760 --> 25:07.960]  And I was like, you want to get rid of that real quick?
[25:07.960 --> 25:08.800]  You know?
[25:08.800 --> 25:10.240]  And he was like, yeah, for sure.
[25:10.240 --> 25:11.080]  You know?
[25:11.080 --> 25:12.720]  So we just took some lactobacillus serum.
[25:12.720 --> 25:15.120]  You spray that for three days and it's completely gone.
[25:15.120 --> 25:17.600]  Cause beneficial fungi overtakes bad fungi.
[25:17.600 --> 25:18.440]  Yeah.
[25:18.440 --> 25:19.260]  That's a whole lie.
[25:19.260 --> 25:21.080]  You know, that's like a farmer's tale about like,
[25:21.080 --> 25:23.200]  you know, PM being systematic and stuff like that.
[25:23.200 --> 25:24.280]  It's definitely not systematic.
[25:24.280 --> 25:25.640]  He went through his whole flower period
[25:25.640 --> 25:27.960]  and had no PM whatsoever.
[25:27.960 --> 25:28.800]  Very nice.
[25:28.800 --> 25:30.640]  You know, just plants.
[25:30.640 --> 25:32.640]  PM can be a real bitch sometimes in Colorado
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.840]  when the temperature changes here.
[25:34.360 --> 25:35.360]  And it changes every day.
[25:35.360 --> 25:36.200]  I've had to cut down rooms.
[25:36.200 --> 25:37.040]  I did just eat yesterday and snowed today.
[25:37.040 --> 25:38.240]  That's what I was about to say.
[25:38.240 --> 25:40.200]  Yesterday you were wearing shorts and like,
[25:40.200 --> 25:41.120]  I was like, it's too warm.
[25:41.120 --> 25:42.680]  I wish I had on shorts and a t-shirt.
[25:42.680 --> 25:44.340]  And now today I woke up and I was like, it's cold.
[25:44.340 --> 25:45.180]  What happened?
[25:45.180 --> 25:46.000]  What is going on?
[25:46.000 --> 25:47.120]  And it's snowing and shit.
[25:47.120 --> 25:49.360]  I've been hoping on Friday, a little brag here.
[25:49.360 --> 25:51.720]  I get to go see Joe Rogan at Comedy Works Friday.
[25:51.720 --> 25:53.520]  And I was just hoping don't snow until Saturday.
[25:53.520 --> 25:54.600]  Don't snow until Saturday.
[25:54.600 --> 25:55.440]  It's all I was hoping for.
[25:55.440 --> 25:57.040]  And it fucking got me on Thursday.
[25:57.040 --> 25:58.240]  Like jinxed myself.
[25:58.240 --> 25:59.320]  Damn it, Joe Rogan.
[26:01.240 --> 26:02.160]  Oh well, it'll be a good time.
[26:02.160 --> 26:03.000]  Shout out to Comedy Works.
[26:03.840 --> 26:04.680]  I cannot wait.
[26:04.680 --> 26:05.500]  That's gonna be fun.
[26:05.500 --> 26:07.360]  Yeah, I'm so, so stoked.
[26:07.360 --> 26:08.440]  I go to a lot of comedy shows
[26:08.440 --> 26:10.240]  and Joe Rogan is probably one of the few
[26:10.240 --> 26:12.200]  that like really get me super pumped.
[26:12.200 --> 26:13.720]  You know, I have to go to as many as I go to.
[26:13.720 --> 26:14.840]  It's like, yeah, I'm going to a show,
[26:14.840 --> 26:16.400]  but now I'm like, yeah.
[26:16.400 --> 26:17.240]  He's tight, right?
[26:17.240 --> 26:18.720]  Yeah, Rogan and Joey Diaz.
[26:18.720 --> 26:19.960]  Oh, jeez.
[26:19.960 --> 26:20.800]  There's a few of them.
[26:20.800 --> 26:23.680]  I got lucky enough to see Diaz also.
[26:23.680 --> 26:24.520]  Nice.
[26:24.520 --> 26:25.340]  Yeah, it was rad.
[26:25.340 --> 26:26.600]  All right, let's see how long we've been going.
[26:26.600 --> 26:27.960]  26 minutes, we'll talk more.
[26:27.960 --> 26:31.480]  So it seems like you guys both follow the TLO book
[26:31.480 --> 26:33.080]  quite a bit as a good way to get started.
[26:33.120 --> 26:34.960]  Would you recommend the TLO book from the Rev?
[26:34.960 --> 26:35.800]  Definitely.
[26:35.800 --> 26:36.620]  Is that all right?
[26:36.620 --> 26:37.460]  100%.
[26:37.460 --> 26:38.280]  Yeah, all right.
[26:38.280 --> 26:39.240]  Have you ever grown any of his seeds?
[26:39.240 --> 26:40.080]  I have not.
[26:40.080 --> 26:41.440]  It seems like he puts out some good seeds.
[26:41.440 --> 26:42.480]  I haven't grown any of them yet,
[26:42.480 --> 26:45.320]  but I've got a peck somewhere that I should grow, I guess.
[26:45.320 --> 26:47.800]  I mean, I'm sure he's grown five.
[26:47.800 --> 26:48.640]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[26:48.640 --> 26:49.800]  I mean, he's been doing it for so long
[26:49.800 --> 26:51.320]  that he better have the fire by now.
[26:51.320 --> 26:52.600]  Oh yeah.
[26:52.600 --> 26:54.040]  Shout out to the Rev.
[26:54.040 --> 26:56.420]  They made him change his Facebook page to his real name.
[26:56.420 --> 26:57.600]  So that's weird.
[26:57.600 --> 26:59.560]  Yeah, it's really weird seeing all these people's real names.
[26:59.560 --> 27:00.400]  Shout out to the Rev.
[27:00.400 --> 27:02.240]  Check out the TLO book, True Living Organics.
[27:02.240 --> 27:03.080]  Yeah, it's the truth.
[27:03.080 --> 27:04.840]  What's the other book that he did
[27:04.840 --> 27:06.760]  that I did not write down the name of?
[27:07.840 --> 27:09.000]  Okay, everybody went blank.
[27:09.000 --> 27:09.840]  Anyway, the Rev.
[27:09.840 --> 27:10.800]  Check out his cannabis books.
[27:10.800 --> 27:11.640]  They're great.
[27:11.640 --> 27:12.760]  And then there's some other ones.
[27:12.760 --> 27:14.600]  What is it, Teeming with Microbes?
[27:14.600 --> 27:15.640]  That's the book I'm trying to think of.
[27:15.640 --> 27:16.640]  Is that the Rev also?
[27:16.640 --> 27:17.480]  No.
[27:17.480 --> 27:18.300]  No, that's not the Rev.
[27:18.300 --> 27:19.140]  That's just some,
[27:19.140 --> 27:19.960]  they're not even weed guys.
[27:19.960 --> 27:20.800]  It's not even about cannabis at all.
[27:20.800 --> 27:21.840]  They're just about-
[27:21.840 --> 27:22.680]  Soil Food Web.
[27:22.680 --> 27:24.120]  Yeah, it's all about the Soil Food Web.
[27:24.120 --> 27:25.680]  All right, well check out Teeming with Microbes.
[27:25.680 --> 27:26.880]  That's a great book in my opinion.
[27:26.880 --> 27:27.720]  Oh, it's the best.
[27:27.720 --> 27:29.240]  That's the best, yeah.
[27:29.240 --> 27:32.280]  It'll teach you how to keep your Soil Food Web rocking.
[27:32.280 --> 27:33.600]  Read TLO first
[27:33.600 --> 27:36.480]  because Teeming with Microbes is a little bit-
[27:36.480 --> 27:37.320]  Overwhelming.
[27:37.320 --> 27:38.520]  It's not really beginner information.
[27:38.520 --> 27:41.560]  You need to have kind of an idea of what's going on
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.040]  to, or it'll just go right over your head otherwise.
[27:45.040 --> 27:46.880]  It skips a lot of basic stuff.
[27:46.880 --> 27:47.840]  You'll have to Google all the basics.
[27:47.840 --> 27:48.840]  Exactly, exactly.
[27:48.840 --> 27:50.280]  So read TLO.
[27:50.280 --> 27:51.280]  TLO's a great one.
[27:51.280 --> 27:53.840]  And then once you get a good handle on that,
[27:53.840 --> 27:54.880]  you think you have an understanding
[27:54.880 --> 27:56.600]  of like how organics work
[27:56.640 --> 27:59.240]  and you wanna dive a little deeper,
[27:59.240 --> 28:00.600]  open up Teeming with Microbes
[28:00.600 --> 28:01.840]  and learn about the Soil Food Web
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.240]  because that's where No-Till really comes into play.
[28:05.240 --> 28:06.080]  Okay.
[28:06.080 --> 28:06.900]  The Soil Food Web
[28:06.900 --> 28:08.480]  because that's what's happening inside of your soil
[28:08.480 --> 28:12.400]  is you've got a whole ecosystem of microorganisms living,
[28:12.400 --> 28:16.760]  breeding, excreting, feeding your plants.
[28:17.640 --> 28:20.120]  So yeah, definitely check both of those out.
[28:20.120 --> 28:21.360]  Any other books you two would recommend
[28:21.360 --> 28:23.560]  while you're talking about books?
[28:23.560 --> 28:24.800]  Teeming with Nutrients is pretty good.
[28:24.800 --> 28:26.520]  It's a little bit less about organics.
[28:27.340 --> 28:28.920]  It's the same guys that did Teeming with Microbes.
[28:28.920 --> 28:29.880]  I've skimmed through that.
[28:29.880 --> 28:30.720]  We have it at work.
[28:30.720 --> 28:32.880]  I've skimmed through it a couple of times.
[28:32.880 --> 28:36.540]  It's just more, yes, it's less organic based,
[28:36.540 --> 28:38.840]  but if you don't wanna do the full organic ride,
[28:38.840 --> 28:40.680]  which I understand some people don't wanna do it,
[28:40.680 --> 28:41.520]  check it out.
[28:41.520 --> 28:43.760]  It'll kind of give you a little bit better understanding
[28:43.760 --> 28:45.280]  of what's going on in your soil
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.760]  with your nutrients and bottle feeding and stuff.
[28:48.760 --> 28:49.600]  Okay.
[28:49.600 --> 28:50.420]  So it's pretty cool.
[28:50.420 --> 28:52.760]  You guys ever get any of your No-Till products
[28:52.760 --> 28:54.300]  tested by any of the labs?
[28:54.940 --> 28:59.940]  Um, I haven't yet, but I want to really soon.
[28:59.980 --> 29:02.060]  I think me and my buddy were gonna go up to Springs
[29:02.060 --> 29:06.380]  to, what is it, CB1 Analytics or something?
[29:06.380 --> 29:07.700]  CB1, shout out Nate.
[29:07.700 --> 29:08.540]  Yeah, I think-
[29:08.540 --> 29:09.360]  There we go.
[29:09.360 --> 29:10.200]  Are they reputable?
[29:10.200 --> 29:11.040]  Would you give them a name?
[29:11.040 --> 29:11.860]  Oh yeah, CB1, shout out Nate.
[29:11.860 --> 29:12.700]  In Colorado Springs, huh?
[29:12.700 --> 29:13.540]  I didn't know there was a testing facility available.
[29:13.540 --> 29:16.180]  I don't know if they do the pesticides or not though.
[29:16.180 --> 29:18.140]  I wanted them to do a full analysis
[29:18.140 --> 29:20.840]  just so I could just show how food grade our cannabis is,
[29:20.840 --> 29:22.460]  that we don't spray no pesticides,
[29:22.460 --> 29:23.700]  we don't use no bullshit.
[29:24.020 --> 29:27.300]  We don't use bottles, there's no heavy metals.
[29:27.300 --> 29:29.380]  You could test it all the way down
[29:29.380 --> 29:31.860]  and it's just gonna be pure cannabis.
[29:31.860 --> 29:33.180]  Right, okay.
[29:33.180 --> 29:34.220]  Well, I'd love to see the tests.
[29:34.220 --> 29:37.660]  I want to see what kind of THC, CBD, CBG, CBN.
[29:37.660 --> 29:38.500]  You know what I mean?
[29:38.500 --> 29:39.320]  I want to see all that stuff,
[29:39.320 --> 29:40.380]  what's coming out on the No-Till.
[29:40.380 --> 29:41.220]  Just curious.
[29:41.220 --> 29:42.040]  Oh yeah.
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.020]  I just smoked and saw your product.
[29:43.020 --> 29:44.180]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm high as shit
[29:44.180 --> 29:47.300]  from smoking some of Frosty's Frosty Gorilla Glue 4.
[29:47.300 --> 29:48.140]  Thank you.
[29:48.140 --> 29:52.420]  The trichomes were really short and all over the place.
[29:52.420 --> 29:54.100]  It didn't look like they got really tall.
[29:54.100 --> 29:56.620]  It looked like they were fighting for space in there.
[29:56.620 --> 29:58.740]  Yeah, I guess that's just me,
[29:58.740 --> 30:01.300]  the way I feed my plants and stuff like that.
[30:01.300 --> 30:03.300]  Nothing, I'm just saying, it was Frosty.
[30:03.300 --> 30:04.500]  They were fighting for space in there.
[30:04.500 --> 30:05.340]  Yeah, for sure.
[30:05.340 --> 30:07.980]  They got good and heavily medicated on there.
[30:07.980 --> 30:08.820]  Thank you.
[30:11.020 --> 30:13.380]  Can we talk about where people can acquire
[30:13.380 --> 30:15.020]  some of your great smokables?
[30:15.020 --> 30:17.460]  Is that something you feel like you want to mention
[30:17.460 --> 30:18.280]  on the show?
[30:18.280 --> 30:19.460]  If not, I could totally hit a little bit of editing
[30:19.460 --> 30:20.780]  and take this part right out.
[30:20.780 --> 30:22.300]  No, for sure.
[30:23.140 --> 30:23.980]  At the Canna Canyon.
[30:23.980 --> 30:25.820]  Yeah, shout out to our friends at the Canna Canyon,
[30:25.820 --> 30:27.180]  a beautiful Colorado Springs.
[30:27.180 --> 30:29.140]  Yeah, I carry a lot of my product over there.
[30:29.140 --> 30:32.620]  I guess you could say, I'm kind of a co-op grower for them
[30:32.620 --> 30:34.140]  and stuff like that.
[30:34.140 --> 30:35.180]  They carry my product there.
[30:35.180 --> 30:36.340]  So if you are a member there,
[30:36.340 --> 30:39.020]  you can go reimburse my product there.
[30:39.020 --> 30:41.860]  But in the streets and stuff like that,
[30:41.860 --> 30:44.460]  personally, that's not my thing and stuff like that.
[30:44.460 --> 30:45.820]  The canyons would have a shooting force.
[30:45.820 --> 30:46.740]  Exactly.
[30:46.740 --> 30:48.780]  People from anywhere, if you're 21 and over,
[30:48.780 --> 30:51.520]  you're able to come to the Canna Canyon in Colorado Springs.
[30:51.560 --> 30:52.640]  It's on Colorado Boulevard.
[30:52.640 --> 30:54.360]  I cannot think of the exact address.
[30:54.360 --> 30:56.880]  It's like 1505, I think, 1507.
[30:56.880 --> 30:59.080]  Yeah, Will's gonna search for me while I ramble on.
[30:59.080 --> 31:00.880]  But come to the Canna Canyon in Colorado Springs.
[31:00.880 --> 31:02.800]  If you're 21 and over, if you've got a valid ID
[31:02.800 --> 31:04.240]  and you're not an asshole,
[31:04.240 --> 31:06.920]  we invite you to come to the Canna Canyon.
[31:06.920 --> 31:09.200]  Please sign up, join as a member,
[31:09.200 --> 31:10.080]  sign the member agreement.
[31:10.080 --> 31:10.920]  You got the address, bro?
[31:10.920 --> 31:13.680]  Yeah, it's 1507 West Colorado Avenue.
[31:13.680 --> 31:14.840]  Yeah, I nailed it.
[31:14.840 --> 31:18.760]  1507 West Colorado Avenue in beautiful Colorado Springs.
[31:18.760 --> 31:20.200]  Parking in the front's kind of a bitch,
[31:20.200 --> 31:21.820]  but parking in the back is available.
[31:21.820 --> 31:23.560]  Go into the alley.
[31:23.560 --> 31:25.400]  You gotta park kind of diagonal in there.
[31:25.400 --> 31:26.640]  You'll see it, do it.
[31:26.640 --> 31:27.480]  It's near the 7-Eleven.
[31:27.480 --> 31:30.400]  If you see the 7-Eleven, go across the street, you're close.
[31:30.400 --> 31:31.520]  But come in there.
[31:31.520 --> 31:33.160]  Be 21, don't be a dick, have an ID,
[31:33.160 --> 31:36.680]  sign the member agreement, join, come in, hang out,
[31:36.680 --> 31:37.960]  take a couple dabs, smoke with us.
[31:37.960 --> 31:39.480]  Chances are I might be there.
[31:39.480 --> 31:40.920]  Deb and Granny might be there.
[31:40.920 --> 31:42.060]  Will might be there.
[31:42.060 --> 31:43.320]  Frosty could be there.
[31:43.320 --> 31:44.600]  I don't know, you're only in town for a few days,
[31:44.600 --> 31:46.480]  but shit, by the time this episode comes out,
[31:46.480 --> 31:47.800]  hey, my new friend Logan could be there.
[31:47.800 --> 31:48.640]  You never know.
[31:48.640 --> 31:49.480]  Come in there, take a dab.
[31:49.480 --> 31:51.680]  The Traveling Stoner is there all the damn time.
[31:51.680 --> 31:53.080]  Camille is there all the time.
[31:53.080 --> 31:57.220]  You can see the dogs, but you can also grab some flowers
[31:57.220 --> 31:59.360]  that were done by our good friend Frosty here
[31:59.360 --> 32:01.160]  that are totally organic, that are beautiful,
[32:01.160 --> 32:02.000]  that are gorgeous.
[32:02.000 --> 32:03.280]  Last time I was there, I think they had some
[32:03.280 --> 32:04.840]  of the Gorilla Glue on the shelf.
[32:04.840 --> 32:06.400]  It's beautiful, it's a crowd favorite.
[32:06.400 --> 32:07.520]  Doesn't stay long.
[32:07.520 --> 32:08.520]  No, it doesn't.
[32:08.520 --> 32:09.360]  It does not.
[32:09.360 --> 32:12.400]  They get busy when some stuff comes around.
[32:12.400 --> 32:14.320]  So that was a huge shout out to the Cannon Cannon.
[32:14.320 --> 32:16.520]  You guys can write the check out to Rasta Jeff.
[32:17.480 --> 32:18.760]  And just to plug myself,
[32:18.760 --> 32:21.360]  you can also find my extracts on the shelves there too.
[32:21.360 --> 32:22.200]  Yes, you can.
[32:22.200 --> 32:23.760]  I was gonna give you a shout out for that.
[32:23.760 --> 32:25.840]  It said on the little parchment paper
[32:25.840 --> 32:28.100]  that it was 27 point something grams
[32:28.100 --> 32:29.760]  when you dropped it off is what it looked like.
[32:29.760 --> 32:31.600]  Bro, it was nowhere near 27 grams.
[32:31.600 --> 32:34.520]  You eat that shit up, it looks like it was popular.
[32:34.520 --> 32:35.680]  Yeah, they've been telling me
[32:35.680 --> 32:36.720]  it's been selling pretty quickly.
[32:36.720 --> 32:39.400]  They're happy with it, so I'm happy with that.
[32:39.400 --> 32:40.240]  That's good product.
[32:40.240 --> 32:42.840]  It's been being reimbursed for quickly.
[32:42.840 --> 32:43.800]  Yeah, whatever.
[32:43.800 --> 32:44.640]  I don't know what you said.
[32:44.640 --> 32:45.480]  I don't know what you said,
[32:45.840 --> 32:46.680]  but yeah, that's something.
[32:46.680 --> 32:50.120]  If you do go to the club, the Cannon Canyon
[32:50.120 --> 32:52.280]  or any of the clubs, learn the lingo.
[32:52.280 --> 32:53.680]  Please say the proper shit.
[32:53.680 --> 32:56.360]  Use the proper terminology, nomenclature,
[32:56.360 --> 32:57.200]  whatever you gotta do.
[32:57.200 --> 32:59.560]  Reimburse however it goes there.
[32:59.560 --> 33:00.400]  Make sure you do that.
[33:00.400 --> 33:01.800]  I know sometimes it feels silly,
[33:01.800 --> 33:03.880]  but that's the way it works.
[33:03.880 --> 33:05.960]  So I think we've covered most of no-till
[33:05.960 --> 33:07.560]  and it sounds like this is a perfect segue
[33:07.560 --> 33:09.800]  into something else that I wanted to talk about.
[33:09.800 --> 33:11.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, in Denver, Colorado,
[33:11.420 --> 33:16.420]  they voted yes to allow consumption of cannabis
[33:16.980 --> 33:18.620]  in adult places.
[33:18.620 --> 33:19.460]  So like some-
[33:19.460 --> 33:20.540]  300, shout out.
[33:20.540 --> 33:23.380]  Some bars and clubs will begin allowing people
[33:23.380 --> 33:27.500]  to smoke cannabis in certain sections indoors in places.
[33:27.500 --> 33:29.420]  That means we're going to have social lounges
[33:29.420 --> 33:30.960]  in Denver very soon.
[33:32.020 --> 33:33.940]  I'm sure that people are looking for buildings
[33:33.940 --> 33:34.780]  to rent right now.
[33:34.780 --> 33:36.060]  There are already places that function
[33:36.060 --> 33:39.460]  kinda illegitimately, kinda under the radar.
[33:39.460 --> 33:40.980]  Those places are probably gonna blow up
[33:41.500 --> 33:42.340]  and be popular.
[33:42.340 --> 33:43.540]  Or there are people out there right now
[33:43.540 --> 33:45.860]  looking for property, painting the walls,
[33:45.860 --> 33:48.220]  getting shit set up, stockpiling product.
[33:48.220 --> 33:49.860]  Because there's one up there.
[33:49.860 --> 33:50.940]  I'm not gonna say who it is,
[33:50.940 --> 33:53.100]  but I've been there a couple of times and it's just-
[33:53.100 --> 33:54.860]  I've been to a couple, just like Springs.
[33:54.860 --> 33:57.020]  I've been to a couple that are really nice.
[33:57.020 --> 33:58.860]  Like the Canyon, the couches,
[33:58.860 --> 34:02.340]  they went to a nice place and bought brand new couches.
[34:02.340 --> 34:03.940]  They bought a rug that matched,
[34:03.940 --> 34:05.800]  that went with the paint on the walls.
[34:05.800 --> 34:08.360]  They got a table with end tables that all match.
[34:08.360 --> 34:10.220]  They got a shelf that's the same kind of wood
[34:10.260 --> 34:11.260]  as the tables.
[34:11.260 --> 34:12.980]  Like it looks like somebody really,
[34:12.980 --> 34:15.820]  they got, they had like their gay interior decorator
[34:15.820 --> 34:17.340]  friend came and helped him out.
[34:17.340 --> 34:19.140]  There's a competitor that's very near there
[34:19.140 --> 34:20.860]  that looks like they got all of their shit
[34:20.860 --> 34:23.680]  at the fucking, the thrift store down the street
[34:23.680 --> 34:26.300]  and their fucking dog laid on it for six weeks.
[34:26.300 --> 34:28.900]  I honestly won't let my dreadlocks touch that couch.
[34:28.900 --> 34:31.300]  I think I've seen it on Instagram.
[34:31.300 --> 34:32.960]  I won't let my dreads down in there.
[34:32.960 --> 34:34.100]  I keep my dreads tied up.
[34:34.100 --> 34:36.660]  I won't let my backpack out of my sight in there.
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.340]  At the Canyon, I'll go take a piss
[34:38.340 --> 34:41.260]  and leave my backpack and my rig and my hash on the table
[34:41.260 --> 34:43.380]  because that's crew in there, that's family.
[34:43.380 --> 34:44.460]  Yeah, it's the homie place.
[34:44.460 --> 34:46.540]  The other place, and there are other places
[34:46.540 --> 34:49.280]  that are in the middle and above and below that.
[34:49.280 --> 34:51.540]  There are some where I won't even take my backpack in
[34:51.540 --> 34:54.020]  because I feel like I might get jacked for it.
[34:54.020 --> 34:55.500]  There are some that are so damn loud
[34:55.500 --> 34:57.340]  because the band is playing constantly
[34:57.340 --> 34:58.820]  that I can't even be there.
[34:58.820 --> 35:00.540]  Like it just, some of the, yeah.
[35:02.740 --> 35:03.900]  But we're going to be able to have clubs.
[35:03.900 --> 35:04.900]  I hope somebody does it right.
[35:04.900 --> 35:06.180]  I hope somebody does like.
[35:06.620 --> 35:09.300]  I mean, someone's going to, it's going to be sweet.
[35:09.300 --> 35:10.300]  There's going to be some cool places.
[35:10.300 --> 35:11.220]  I got to imagine.
[35:11.220 --> 35:13.340]  They don't all have to be reggae lounges, you guys.
[35:13.340 --> 35:16.260]  They don't all have to be dubstep bars.
[35:16.260 --> 35:17.700]  It'd be cool if Cheetah Hut was like,
[35:17.700 --> 35:19.100]  if they let one of their places,
[35:19.100 --> 35:20.660]  if they turned one of their places into a smoker friendly.
[35:20.660 --> 35:22.220]  How cool would that be?
[35:22.220 --> 35:23.060]  Probably not both of them,
[35:23.060 --> 35:24.980]  but if they did the Colfax one, maybe.
[35:24.980 --> 35:27.340]  How about like a smoking night at a bowling alley?
[35:27.340 --> 35:28.180]  Oh, that'd be sweet.
[35:28.180 --> 35:31.260]  Seeing that opens up all these, that's so cool.
[35:31.260 --> 35:32.180]  I wonder if you need to get,
[35:32.180 --> 35:34.500]  if it's a permit or a special license you'll need to get.
[35:34.500 --> 35:36.180]  I wonder if it's one of those things you can be like,
[35:36.180 --> 35:38.180]  hey, can we get a permit for Saturday night
[35:38.180 --> 35:39.620]  so we can allow smoking?
[35:39.620 --> 35:43.100]  Or is it just like a, and we're all hypothetical now,
[35:43.100 --> 35:45.140]  you guys, this is all shit that is going to come up
[35:45.140 --> 35:47.620]  and this is stuff, okay, I preach this all the time.
[35:47.620 --> 35:48.900]  When you're writing rules in your area,
[35:48.900 --> 35:50.580]  write this shit in so that we don't have to sit here
[35:50.580 --> 35:51.660]  and make it up right now.
[35:51.660 --> 35:53.460]  Because if you don't write these rules in,
[35:53.460 --> 35:55.740]  you're rulemaking old people in suits
[35:55.740 --> 35:57.100]  that don't give a fuck about cannabis,
[35:57.100 --> 35:58.620]  that don't take dabs, that don't go out,
[35:58.620 --> 36:00.140]  are going to write these rules and it's going to suck.
[36:00.140 --> 36:00.980]  It sucks.
[36:00.980 --> 36:04.100]  So maybe you can get like, like you get a liquor license.
[36:04.700 --> 36:07.460]  Just pay for a year of a cannabis consumption license
[36:07.460 --> 36:09.700]  so that every night after 9 p.m.
[36:09.700 --> 36:12.500]  you can consume cannabis in your facility or whatever.
[36:12.500 --> 36:15.180]  Yeah, from nine to two, nine to three.
[36:15.180 --> 36:17.940]  Then that way at two when you got to collect all the drinks,
[36:17.940 --> 36:19.940]  you take some dabs and hang out and socialize.
[36:19.940 --> 36:22.260]  That way nobody ever gets in a fight, ever.
[36:22.260 --> 36:24.500]  He's got something to say, pass him a mic.
[36:24.500 --> 36:27.380]  Well, my thought too is what about like,
[36:27.380 --> 36:30.300]  if you bring your own like dabs to these places,
[36:30.300 --> 36:31.380]  is that going to be allowed?
[36:31.380 --> 36:33.020]  That's basically the way it's going to work
[36:33.020 --> 36:35.300]  with our marijuana enforcement division system.
[36:35.300 --> 36:37.100]  That's mostly the way it's going to have to work
[36:37.100 --> 36:38.660]  is to bring your own cannabis system.
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.180]  Okay.
[36:40.180 --> 36:42.100]  I'm sure they'll cut the loophole
[36:42.100 --> 36:43.060]  out of that one pretty quickly
[36:43.060 --> 36:44.620]  because they've seen how it worked.
[36:44.620 --> 36:45.460]  What the can do?
[36:45.460 --> 36:46.900]  They've seen how it works down in Colorado Springs
[36:46.900 --> 36:47.900]  with the loopholes.
[36:47.900 --> 36:49.340]  So I feel like they'll probably make it.
[36:49.340 --> 36:52.020]  So it's like, all right, there's no reimbursement.
[36:52.020 --> 36:53.140]  This is not a co-op.
[36:53.140 --> 36:55.420]  This is, you can bring,
[36:55.420 --> 36:57.500]  I think they'll make it pretty clear that it's like,
[36:57.500 --> 37:01.660]  there will be no money handed to anybody for anything.
[37:02.300 --> 37:03.340]  They'll have to have, you know what?
[37:03.340 --> 37:04.180]  I'd love to have it.
[37:04.180 --> 37:05.540]  They call it a barcade is the theme.
[37:05.540 --> 37:08.220]  You go to the bars, you get drinks and play video games.
[37:08.220 --> 37:09.060]  I don't drink.
[37:09.060 --> 37:11.940]  So I just stand there like, I like supernova and Springs.
[37:11.940 --> 37:14.260]  So I just kind of stand there like, this is fun.
[37:14.260 --> 37:15.300]  I can play some street fighter
[37:15.300 --> 37:17.100]  and all you fucking drunks are spilling beer on me.
[37:17.100 --> 37:21.260]  And like, honestly, I would like a beer,
[37:21.260 --> 37:23.740]  but unfortunately I don't know how to have a beer.
[37:23.740 --> 37:26.180]  I like to have about 20 or 30 beers.
[37:26.180 --> 37:27.380]  So I just don't drink at all.
[37:27.380 --> 37:29.700]  It's a lot better for me because I'll have a beer
[37:29.700 --> 37:31.100]  and then somebody will be like, you want a shot?
[37:31.540 --> 37:32.380]  And yes, I do want a shot.
[37:32.380 --> 37:33.540]  And then do you want another shot?
[37:33.540 --> 37:34.380]  Yes, I do.
[37:34.380 --> 37:35.460]  And now I don't know where the fuck I am
[37:35.460 --> 37:37.100]  or where my money or my car is.
[37:37.100 --> 37:39.900]  And I drink a lot of shots and I just, there's no,
[37:39.900 --> 37:41.140]  there's just no line for me.
[37:41.140 --> 37:42.620]  So I choose not to drink at all,
[37:42.620 --> 37:44.300]  but I could smoke like the best of them.
[37:44.300 --> 37:46.500]  So I wish that while all my friends are at supernova
[37:46.500 --> 37:48.340]  drinking and doing shots,
[37:48.340 --> 37:49.620]  yeah, have a fat joint in my hand
[37:49.620 --> 37:50.860]  and play some street fighter too, man.
[37:50.860 --> 37:51.900]  Throw some sonic booms.
[37:51.900 --> 37:54.060]  And email plugged into the side of the arcade.
[37:54.060 --> 37:54.900]  Yeah, yeah.
[37:54.900 --> 37:55.740]  That'd be bad ass.
[37:55.740 --> 37:57.180]  Just be up there playing some Tekken
[37:57.180 --> 37:58.300]  and slaying it all night.
[37:58.300 --> 37:59.140]  It'd be fun.
[37:59.140 --> 37:59.980]  Oh yeah.
[38:00.020 --> 38:01.500]  Somebody open up a,
[38:01.500 --> 38:03.140]  so that would be the way to have revenue.
[38:03.140 --> 38:05.420]  Have some video games, maybe some laser tag in there.
[38:05.420 --> 38:06.260]  I'm sure there'll be coming,
[38:06.260 --> 38:08.300]  because even like I said, this opens up, you know.
[38:08.300 --> 38:10.540]  Yeah, the ganja gourmet can go back
[38:10.540 --> 38:11.820]  to their original format now.
[38:11.820 --> 38:13.860]  You used to be able to go smoke at the ganja gourmet.
[38:13.860 --> 38:14.700]  Oh, that'd be awesome.
[38:14.700 --> 38:15.940]  You just go get some really good food,
[38:15.940 --> 38:17.540]  some super heady food and smoke.
[38:17.540 --> 38:19.940]  Well, that would also like bring OSHA in there.
[38:19.940 --> 38:23.580]  Like if, or just with smoking, you know,
[38:23.580 --> 38:26.620]  because smoke is like banned, like I think nationwide.
[38:26.620 --> 38:29.380]  Yeah, it's state to state or county to county.
[38:29.740 --> 38:30.660]  There's the Clean Air Act.
[38:30.660 --> 38:32.980]  So you're not supposed to be able to smoke in places.
[38:32.980 --> 38:34.260]  But if that's why I was saying
[38:34.260 --> 38:36.100]  you could get that yearly liquor license,
[38:36.100 --> 38:37.900]  that cannabis consumption license,
[38:37.900 --> 38:39.500]  it would probably break that,
[38:39.500 --> 38:42.540]  give you that rule override somehow, your card.
[38:42.540 --> 38:43.660]  And I'm sure like, again,
[38:43.660 --> 38:45.780]  like once the taboo is just broken down,
[38:45.780 --> 38:48.260]  like in these restaurants and places, you know,
[38:48.260 --> 38:49.660]  people just aren't gonna care.
[38:49.660 --> 38:52.620]  Imagine like by the third or fourth cannabis night
[38:52.620 --> 38:55.740]  at the bowling alley, bowl night at the bowling alley,
[38:55.740 --> 38:58.300]  they're gonna be like, dude, this snack bar fucking crushed.
[38:58.340 --> 39:01.060]  We've never sold so many nachos ever.
[39:01.060 --> 39:03.420]  Let's do this all the time.
[39:03.420 --> 39:05.060]  Everybody was peaceful.
[39:05.060 --> 39:07.260]  Like there were a couple of dudes who just stood there.
[39:07.260 --> 39:08.900]  They paid for their bowling shoes.
[39:08.900 --> 39:12.060]  They fucking stood there and stared at the lane moving.
[39:12.060 --> 39:13.300]  They didn't do anything.
[39:13.300 --> 39:14.140]  We got-
[39:14.140 --> 39:15.420]  They turned the black lights on.
[39:15.420 --> 39:16.300]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:16.300 --> 39:17.780]  That's what I see in my mind too.
[39:17.780 --> 39:19.660]  I used to be the manager of bowling alley
[39:19.660 --> 39:21.140]  that used to do the black light bowling.
[39:21.140 --> 39:22.420]  So I could see it all in my mind.
[39:22.420 --> 39:25.260]  If we could have just smoked in there, oh my God.
[39:25.260 --> 39:26.420]  Everything would have been better.
[39:26.420 --> 39:27.420]  We had so many fights in there
[39:27.540 --> 39:29.740]  because we served tons of alcohol.
[39:29.740 --> 39:33.780]  And you turn on music and you got music, girls and alcohol.
[39:33.780 --> 39:36.100]  And that's the three things that eventually add to a fight.
[39:36.100 --> 39:36.940]  Always.
[39:36.940 --> 39:37.780]  And there are dudes bowling.
[39:37.780 --> 39:39.620]  So they're like, bro, I got a strike, bro.
[39:39.620 --> 39:41.700]  And the guys next to him got a gutter ball.
[39:41.700 --> 39:43.780]  And now they're like, oh yeah, fuck you.
[39:43.780 --> 39:44.780]  That's why they're gonna fight.
[39:44.780 --> 39:47.460]  I saw it fucking once a week in a bowling alley.
[39:47.460 --> 39:48.300]  Yeah.
[39:48.300 --> 39:49.140]  Just let it-
[39:49.140 --> 39:49.980]  Take a dab, bro.
[39:49.980 --> 39:50.820]  Take a dab.
[39:50.820 --> 39:51.660]  You know, you're trying to fight?
[39:51.660 --> 39:52.500]  Hit this.
[39:52.500 --> 39:55.300]  Where's they pass out and problem solved there anyway.
[39:55.300 --> 39:56.140]  Right?
[39:56.260 --> 39:58.060]  Why was I trying to fight you again, dude?
[39:58.060 --> 39:58.900]  I'm high.
[40:01.020 --> 40:02.220]  You've got good weed, bro.
[40:02.220 --> 40:03.420]  We need to be friends.
[40:05.180 --> 40:06.420]  We just become best friends.
[40:06.420 --> 40:09.180]  Oh, I love that we had a really serious lesson on no-till
[40:09.180 --> 40:11.060]  and then we turned it into whole wheat chatter,
[40:11.060 --> 40:11.900]  which is awesome.
[40:11.900 --> 40:12.780]  The people like it.
[40:12.780 --> 40:14.660]  People that are from other states like yourself
[40:14.660 --> 40:16.380]  that don't get to be here and involved in this
[40:16.380 --> 40:17.500]  kind of love to hear us chatter
[40:17.500 --> 40:18.500]  about what it's like to be here.
[40:18.500 --> 40:19.340]  They do.
[40:19.340 --> 40:20.160]  Like I get messages like,
[40:20.160 --> 40:21.380]  bro, it's like hanging out with you.
[40:21.380 --> 40:22.220]  It's like freedom for some people.
[40:22.220 --> 40:23.900]  Yeah, actually I used to listen to the podcast
[40:23.900 --> 40:24.900]  back when I lived in North Carolina.
[40:24.900 --> 40:26.060]  I do remember it kind of being like that.
[40:26.060 --> 40:27.820]  Sometimes like, man, it sounds like it's cool over there.
[40:27.820 --> 40:28.660]  Yeah.
[40:28.660 --> 40:29.500]  Yeah.
[40:29.500 --> 40:30.320]  I remember when I was with Maddie and Spence
[40:30.320 --> 40:31.580]  was coming on the show and I was like, well,
[40:31.580 --> 40:32.660]  Shout out to Maddie and Spence.
[40:32.660 --> 40:33.940]  It's good to see those kids doing well.
[40:33.940 --> 40:35.180]  That's how I met you guys.
[40:35.180 --> 40:36.460]  If it weren't for Maddie and Spence,
[40:36.460 --> 40:37.940]  I wouldn't know either one of you.
[40:37.940 --> 40:38.780]  That's how I met you.
[40:38.780 --> 40:40.900]  That's how I met y'all.
[40:40.900 --> 40:41.740]  Miss those guys.
[40:41.740 --> 40:42.940]  And now we're all growing the same genetics.
[40:42.940 --> 40:45.020]  I feel like everybody that I know for the most part,
[40:45.020 --> 40:46.820]  I've met either through,
[40:46.820 --> 40:47.820]  that I haven't met through work,
[40:47.820 --> 40:49.020]  I've met through them.
[40:49.020 --> 40:51.300]  Or through somebody I met through them.
[40:51.300 --> 40:53.060]  Where are you from, Frosty?
[40:53.060 --> 40:53.900]  I'm from Oklahoma.
[40:53.900 --> 40:54.740]  Oklahoma.
[40:54.740 --> 40:55.560]  Okay.
[40:55.560 --> 40:56.400]  I never knew that, bro.
[40:56.400 --> 40:57.580]  I assumed you were from North Carolina.
[40:57.580 --> 40:59.460]  Just cause everybody else that I met through Spence
[40:59.460 --> 41:00.380]  was from North Carolina.
[41:00.380 --> 41:01.860]  No, I actually, you know,
[41:01.860 --> 41:05.020]  met Spence a long time ago whenever,
[41:05.020 --> 41:07.060]  you know, the greener side was still open and all that.
[41:07.060 --> 41:07.900]  Okay.
[41:07.900 --> 41:08.720]  Shout out to Hanky B.
[41:08.720 --> 41:09.560]  Yeah.
[41:09.560 --> 41:11.540]  I actually met him through Hank and stuff like that.
[41:11.540 --> 41:14.220]  You know, so I've known Spencer for, you know,
[41:14.220 --> 41:15.140]  quite some time.
[41:15.140 --> 41:15.980]  Yeah.
[41:15.980 --> 41:16.800]  Good kids.
[41:16.800 --> 41:17.640]  Yeah.
[41:17.640 --> 41:18.460]  Gardner Weeden crew.
[41:18.460 --> 41:19.300]  Oh yeah.
[41:19.300 --> 41:20.140]  Yeah.
[41:20.140 --> 41:20.960]  Hanky B.
[41:20.960 --> 41:22.300]  He post pics of that little kid.
[41:22.340 --> 41:24.300]  Dude, I get tired of seeing people's kids on Instagram
[41:24.300 --> 41:25.140]  and on Facebook,
[41:25.140 --> 41:27.860]  but goddamn Hank's son's a handsome little G.
[41:27.860 --> 41:30.020]  That dude's going to be a pimp, bro.
[41:30.020 --> 41:31.820]  Ladies and gentlemen, hide your fucking daughter
[41:31.820 --> 41:34.660]  because Hank's kid, Lucas, is coming to get her.
[41:34.660 --> 41:35.620]  He's coming to get him.
[41:35.620 --> 41:36.460]  Yeah, bro.
[41:36.460 --> 41:37.280]  He is a pimp.
[41:37.280 --> 41:38.120]  He's a baller.
[41:38.120 --> 41:39.140]  He's a handsome little devil.
[41:39.140 --> 41:39.980]  Yeah.
[41:39.980 --> 41:40.940]  He dresses and looks just like daddy.
[41:40.940 --> 41:41.780]  Yeah.
[41:41.780 --> 41:43.780]  He's a little micro pimp.
[41:43.780 --> 41:44.620]  He's on it.
[41:44.620 --> 41:45.440]  That's awesome.
[41:45.440 --> 41:46.280]  Yeah.
[41:46.280 --> 41:47.380]  You guys got anything else that you want to say
[41:47.380 --> 41:49.380]  on a podcast since you've got a whole lot of people
[41:49.380 --> 41:50.780]  listening to you?
[41:50.780 --> 41:51.740]  Go organic.
[41:52.140 --> 41:52.980]  Go organic.
[41:52.980 --> 41:53.800]  Go Motel.
[41:53.800 --> 41:58.660]  If you want to smoke the terpious, the tastiest,
[41:58.660 --> 42:02.700]  smoothest, cleanest cannabis that you can consume,
[42:02.700 --> 42:03.780]  go organic, man.
[42:03.780 --> 42:04.860]  If you're trying to heal somebody,
[42:04.860 --> 42:07.380]  if you're trying to get rid of cancer,
[42:07.380 --> 42:08.780]  or if you're trying to take care of people
[42:08.780 --> 42:11.900]  that have conditions like Crohn's disease,
[42:11.900 --> 42:14.700]  or possibly an autoimmune disease,
[42:14.700 --> 42:16.140]  or anything that you're trying to take care of,
[42:16.140 --> 42:18.660]  you don't want to give people shit medicine.
[42:18.660 --> 42:20.860]  You want to give them quality medicine
[42:20.900 --> 42:22.580]  that is actually medicine.
[42:22.580 --> 42:23.420]  Exactly.
[42:23.420 --> 42:24.420]  If they want to take shit into their bodies,
[42:24.420 --> 42:26.020]  they just go get pharmaceuticals.
[42:26.020 --> 42:28.060]  They'd go to the pharmacy and get some pills
[42:28.060 --> 42:29.100]  and get some poison.
[42:29.100 --> 42:29.940]  Yep.
[42:29.940 --> 42:30.780]  Please, let's not poison people.
[42:30.780 --> 42:33.260]  Let's not spray stupid shit on our plants.
[42:33.260 --> 42:35.180]  If you're growing with bottles, I'm not hating on you.
[42:35.180 --> 42:36.420]  I grow with bottles, you guys.
[42:36.420 --> 42:38.340]  I like to use Botanic Care Pure Blend Pro.
[42:38.340 --> 42:39.540]  I use Veg Bloom.
[42:39.540 --> 42:42.900]  I've done plenty of that organic as fuck stuff.
[42:42.900 --> 42:45.300]  My lifestyle and the way that I learned how to grow,
[42:45.300 --> 42:46.620]  I'm really comfortable with the bottles.
[42:46.620 --> 42:48.700]  These guys kind of inspire me to step outside the box.
[42:48.740 --> 42:51.620]  You may see me do some attempts at some no-till stuff,
[42:51.620 --> 42:52.860]  but we're not hating on you.
[42:52.860 --> 42:56.180]  If you are growing with bottles, do me one favor and flush.
[42:56.180 --> 42:59.220]  Flush heavily for at least 10 to 14 days.
[42:59.220 --> 43:00.380]  I think 20 days.
[43:00.380 --> 43:03.500]  If you've got a longer strain, go ahead, flush for 20 days.
[43:03.500 --> 43:05.100]  If your leaves start looking a little bit yellow,
[43:05.100 --> 43:05.940]  you're doing it right.
[43:05.940 --> 43:08.100]  Don't get mad at some yellow leaves at the end.
[43:08.100 --> 43:10.180]  That means the plant is using up the nutrients
[43:10.180 --> 43:12.820]  that it needed, and it is now time to come down.
[43:12.820 --> 43:14.580]  Look outside when it's fall time.
[43:14.580 --> 43:15.420]  What happens?
[43:15.420 --> 43:16.820]  The leaves change colors and they come off.
[43:16.820 --> 43:18.700]  If your plant is saying, it's fall time, bro,
[43:18.700 --> 43:20.580]  it's the end, I wanna be done,
[43:20.580 --> 43:22.500]  it's when you should cut it down and take care of it.
[43:22.500 --> 43:23.740]  All right, that's what I think.
[43:23.740 --> 43:24.900]  Sorry about that, man.
[43:26.100 --> 43:26.980]  I have just one more thing.
[43:26.980 --> 43:29.620]  I was gonna say, to anybody that hasn't started,
[43:29.620 --> 43:31.660]  I meant to say this in the last one.
[43:31.660 --> 43:33.180]  Anybody that hasn't started growing yet,
[43:33.180 --> 43:35.020]  and if you wanna get into growing,
[43:35.020 --> 43:38.140]  and you think you eventually do wanna get into organics,
[43:38.140 --> 43:39.260]  and you think it might be smarter
[43:39.260 --> 43:41.140]  to learn with bottles first,
[43:42.260 --> 43:44.180]  I would advise you just go ahead
[43:44.180 --> 43:45.620]  and jump straight into organics,
[43:45.620 --> 43:47.900]  because it's two totally different things.
[43:50.060 --> 43:51.300]  You'll learn how to grow with nutrients,
[43:51.300 --> 43:53.420]  and be like, okay, cool, I'm gonna switch to organics,
[43:53.420 --> 43:55.140]  and it's entirely different.
[43:55.140 --> 43:56.580]  You start from scratch.
[43:56.580 --> 43:58.460]  You have to buy so much different shit.
[43:58.460 --> 44:00.860]  Yeah, it's so much different.
[44:00.860 --> 44:04.140]  So if you know you wanna do organics,
[44:04.140 --> 44:05.340]  just go from the get-go.
[44:05.340 --> 44:07.420]  Just go no-till, because in my opinion,
[44:07.420 --> 44:09.540]  it sounds like no-till, it's gonna cost you
[44:09.540 --> 44:10.940]  a little bit more to get started,
[44:10.940 --> 44:12.700]  but you're gonna have to buy worms.
[44:12.700 --> 44:14.020]  You're gonna need worm castings.
[44:14.020 --> 44:14.980]  You're gonna need amendments.
[44:15.380 --> 44:17.420]  You're gonna need Modern Mix 2.0.
[44:17.420 --> 44:19.860]  You're gonna need to get a head start on yourself,
[44:19.860 --> 44:21.380]  but I think if you're buying something
[44:21.380 --> 44:24.460]  like Advanced Nutrients, or Mills, or Psycho.
[44:24.460 --> 44:26.100]  You're buying bottles every week, bottles every month,
[44:26.100 --> 44:27.740]  and that adds up real quick.
[44:27.740 --> 44:29.700]  Yeah, so just get yourself some no-till,
[44:29.700 --> 44:30.620]  and you're ready to go.
[44:30.620 --> 44:31.820]  You only have to buy it once.
[44:31.820 --> 44:33.940]  After that first harvest, you've paid for that.
[44:33.940 --> 44:34.780]  Oh, yeah, easy.
[44:34.780 --> 44:36.580]  You get it richer and richer and richer.
[44:36.580 --> 44:39.580]  Round 30's gonna be the best round you've had.
[44:39.580 --> 44:42.180]  Oh, man, so it's gonna get better and better and better.
[44:42.180 --> 44:43.540]  And better and better.
[44:43.940 --> 44:44.780]  Your weave is just gonna be a lot more.
[44:44.780 --> 44:49.780]  You just gotta think it's gonna be like the forest,
[44:50.620 --> 44:53.860]  or like the rainforest.
[44:53.860 --> 44:55.780]  The biggest plants in the world are in the rainforest.
[44:55.780 --> 44:57.100]  It has the richest soil in the world,
[44:57.100 --> 45:00.020]  so basically your soil's gonna be like
[45:00.020 --> 45:01.220]  mimicking the rainforest.
[45:01.220 --> 45:02.420]  Yeah, it's undisturbed out there.
[45:02.420 --> 45:03.900]  Nothing fucks with it except nature.
[45:03.900 --> 45:05.300]  So much humics in there, too.
[45:05.300 --> 45:07.940]  Things die, and things decompose.
[45:07.940 --> 45:08.780]  Go ahead, bro.
[45:08.780 --> 45:11.340]  Definitely with Compass, on top of just any style
[45:11.340 --> 45:12.900]  of growing anything.
[45:12.940 --> 45:15.820]  If you just recycle all vegetables and stuff,
[45:15.820 --> 45:19.500]  and even bits of food, you can really get those worms
[45:19.500 --> 45:21.620]  eating and fatter and healthier.
[45:21.620 --> 45:24.500]  It all just feeds itself.
[45:24.500 --> 45:26.060]  It churns itself.
[45:26.060 --> 45:27.380]  Will there ever be a point when I have
[45:27.380 --> 45:28.660]  too many worms in my pot?
[45:28.660 --> 45:29.500]  No.
[45:29.500 --> 45:30.340]  No.
[45:30.340 --> 45:31.340]  Because it's self-sustaining.
[45:31.340 --> 45:33.620]  Yeah, they regulate themselves.
[45:33.620 --> 45:34.860]  They multiply relatively quickly.
[45:34.860 --> 45:36.660]  You'd be surprised at how fast you get a good bit.
[45:36.660 --> 45:39.460]  But they also regulate.
[45:39.580 --> 45:41.860]  It's not gonna, they know, like, okay,
[45:41.860 --> 45:43.260]  there's only X amount of space.
[45:43.260 --> 45:45.140]  Plus, I don't really know the lifespan on a worm,
[45:45.140 --> 45:45.980]  but I can't imagine.
[45:45.980 --> 45:47.620]  Yeah, some of them die off and stuff like that.
[45:47.620 --> 45:48.460]  Of course, yeah.
[45:48.460 --> 45:51.220]  And then they decay, and then they become part of the humus.
[45:51.220 --> 45:54.460]  Yeah, they become food also.
[45:54.460 --> 45:57.740]  Okay, in TLO, I think the Rev actually gives
[45:57.740 --> 46:00.340]  a nice little setup on how to make a worm farm
[46:00.340 --> 46:02.300]  so that you can make your own worm castings
[46:02.300 --> 46:03.940]  from the worms as well.
[46:03.940 --> 46:05.100]  So you can get that going.
[46:05.100 --> 46:07.060]  You can be fully sustainable.
[46:07.100 --> 46:09.580]  Do the worm castings in your garage,
[46:09.580 --> 46:11.340]  because it does kind of stink a little bit.
[46:11.340 --> 46:12.180]  Don't do that one.
[46:12.180 --> 46:13.380]  And you gotta feed it compote.
[46:13.380 --> 46:15.100]  It's mostly what you put in, and it's gonna stink.
[46:15.100 --> 46:16.100]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:16.100 --> 46:18.660]  And I'm a vegetarian, so I'm throwing in avocado peels
[46:18.660 --> 46:21.260]  and apple cores and the tips of the strawberries
[46:21.260 --> 46:23.780]  and all that to create, yeah, my shit's gonna be-
[46:23.780 --> 46:24.620]  It's gonna be super rich, though.
[46:24.620 --> 46:25.780]  It's super rich in nutrients.
[46:25.780 --> 46:27.700]  Yeah, my plants loved it when I was feeding them
[46:27.700 --> 46:28.540]  that type of stuff.
[46:28.540 --> 46:30.300]  They were sweet and sticky.
[46:30.300 --> 46:31.540]  Yeah, excellent.
[46:31.540 --> 46:32.380]  Nice.
[46:32.380 --> 46:33.220]  All right.
[46:33.220 --> 46:34.700]  Man, I shouldn't even tell you how many people listened,
[46:34.700 --> 46:36.780]  but within 24 hours of releasing this episode,
[46:37.500 --> 46:39.060]  about 5,000 people will download and listen to this
[46:39.060 --> 46:41.100]  between iTunes, Stitcher, and my website.
[46:41.100 --> 46:42.860]  Plus I'm available on like seven or eight
[46:42.860 --> 46:44.380]  other podcasting applications
[46:44.380 --> 46:46.340]  that I don't even pay any attention to.
[46:46.340 --> 46:47.660]  So a lot of people are gonna hear this,
[46:47.660 --> 46:49.660]  so I appreciate you guys coming and helping out the growers.
[46:49.660 --> 46:50.900]  Hey, man, we appreciate you having us.
[46:50.900 --> 46:52.100]  Appreciate it.
[46:52.100 --> 46:53.340]  Glad to get you guys on.
[46:53.340 --> 46:54.740]  People love to hear this type of stuff.
[46:54.740 --> 46:56.460]  This is definitely information people need to know,
[46:56.460 --> 46:57.780]  because this is sustainable.
[46:57.780 --> 47:00.300]  I always talk about end of the world scenario.
[47:00.300 --> 47:01.220]  You guys are gonna grow.
[47:01.220 --> 47:03.220]  I'm gonna be rating hydro shops.
[47:03.220 --> 47:04.820]  Gonna need the last bit of the bottles,
[47:04.820 --> 47:06.300]  because it's all going to the end.
[47:06.820 --> 47:07.660]  And you can do this with,
[47:07.660 --> 47:09.300]  this is, no-till will work with a lot of other,
[47:09.300 --> 47:10.220]  I mean, it's not just weed.
[47:10.220 --> 47:11.820]  You can do no-till with basically anything.
[47:11.820 --> 47:13.300]  You'll have to do top dress and amend it
[47:13.300 --> 47:15.020]  a little bit differently depending on what you do,
[47:15.020 --> 47:16.260]  but it's good.
[47:16.260 --> 47:18.340]  Yeah, like you said, end of the world, oh no.
[47:18.340 --> 47:20.380]  No-till, you've got a sustainable garden out front.
[47:20.380 --> 47:21.340]  You've got everything you need.
[47:21.340 --> 47:22.540]  You guys will be growing weed.
[47:22.540 --> 47:25.260]  I'll be making a raft out of bottles.
[47:25.260 --> 47:28.180]  All right, Frosty, remind everybody
[47:28.180 --> 47:29.660]  how they can stalk you on social media
[47:29.660 --> 47:32.100]  so they can check you out and give you a follow.
[47:32.140 --> 47:36.620]  You can follow me on Instagram at Frosty Organics.
[47:36.620 --> 47:39.180]  That's really the only place I am.
[47:39.180 --> 47:40.780]  You probably don't know what I look like
[47:40.780 --> 47:42.420]  unless you know me,
[47:42.420 --> 47:44.580]  because that's just Frosty Organics.
[47:44.580 --> 47:47.100]  He looks like me 10 years ago, you guys.
[47:47.100 --> 47:48.460]  He's a handsome son of a bitch.
[47:48.460 --> 47:50.700]  Appreciate it, appreciate it.
[47:50.700 --> 47:51.860]  Bro, do you have any social media
[47:51.860 --> 47:52.700]  you'd like people to follow you on?

[48:02.420 --> 48:04.740]  and I'm actually going to Mexico in December.
[48:04.740 --> 48:07.340]  I like whitewater kayaking and wire wrapping.
[48:07.340 --> 48:08.180]  Excellent.
[48:08.180 --> 48:09.020]  Give me the follow.

[48:12.380 --> 48:13.940]  so they're gonna love the wire wraps.
[48:13.940 --> 48:14.780]  They're gonna wanna see you go kayaking.
[48:14.780 --> 48:16.260]  He kills it with the wire wraps, he does.
[48:16.260 --> 48:17.100]  You make your own?
[48:17.100 --> 48:18.180]  Yeah, I got one going right now.
[48:18.180 --> 48:19.740]  Oh man, that one is sweet right there.

[48:27.980 --> 48:29.060]  Make sure you check out his work.
[48:29.100 --> 48:31.180]  It sounds like he's got some cool shit going on.
[48:31.180 --> 48:33.980]  All right, Mr. Barefoot, remind us how we can stalk you.
[48:33.980 --> 48:35.580]  You can find me on Instagram
[48:35.580 --> 48:38.820]  as the underscore barefoot underscore grower,

[49:31.380 --> 49:34.480]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[49:34.480 --> 49:37.100]  I would love to know what you think of the podcast.
[49:37.100 --> 49:37.940]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[49:37.940 --> 49:40.100]  I think that's all I have got for you this week.
[49:40.100 --> 49:40.980]  Almost an hour.
[49:40.980 --> 49:42.780]  So you guys say that the episodes are too short.
[49:42.780 --> 49:44.420]  I hope you guys enjoyed this longer episode.
[49:44.420 --> 49:46.400]  I hope you're in your cubicle getting some shit done.
[49:46.400 --> 49:47.940]  I hope you're at the warehouse getting some shit done
[49:47.940 --> 49:49.580]  to this extended episode.
[49:49.580 --> 49:50.900]  Thank you for listening.
[49:50.900 --> 49:52.580]  I wanna thank everybody for joining me.
[49:52.580 --> 49:54.660]  Big shout out to Maddie and Spence out there on the farm,
[49:54.660 --> 49:56.020]  on the mountain, out there on the coast.
[49:56.020 --> 49:57.100]  I love you guys and I miss you.
[49:57.620 --> 49:58.460]  And until next time,
[49:58.460 --> 50:00.620]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[50:26.700 --> 50:30.340]  A tiny space to move and breathe
[50:30.340 --> 50:33.800]  is all that I would ever need.
[50:34.940 --> 50:38.060]  I wanna live beneath the dirt
[50:41.300 --> 50:44.860]  where I'd be free from push and shove
[50:44.860 --> 50:48.140]  like all those swarming up above.
[50:49.460 --> 50:52.700]  Beneath their heels I'll spend my time.
[50:55.940 --> 50:59.570]  I'll wriggle in poo.
[50:59.570 --> 51:03.230]  Shut your knee.
[51:03.230 --> 51:06.910]  And sometimes I will think of you.
[51:06.910 --> 51:18.860]  Shut your knee.
[51:18.860 --> 51:21.660]  What this thought is worth.
[51:21.660 --> 51:24.580]  I'll never hear your voice again.
[53:05.350 --> 53:06.670]  Shut your knee.
