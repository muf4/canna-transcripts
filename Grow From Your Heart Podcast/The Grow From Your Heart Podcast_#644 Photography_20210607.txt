[01:42.420 --> 01:45.620]  So I've been asked a couple of questions lately that we're gonna start the show off here
[01:45.620 --> 01:47.980]  I get a lot of questions saying hey
[01:47.980 --> 01:55.580]  Where can I find either your seeds your clones your flowers or some sort of I read genetics products in dispensaries?
[01:56.020 --> 02:01.800]  Maybe I should give you a little recap. Maybe not. Everybody knows not only am I the host of the grow from your heart podcast?
[02:01.800 --> 02:04.340]  I am also the owner founder sole proprietor
[02:05.120 --> 02:08.640]  The head motherfucker in charge of I read genetics premium seeds
[02:08.820 --> 02:14.520]  So I do run I read genetics premium seeds a lot of people see my Instagram posts my social media posts
[02:14.520 --> 02:20.920]  They want my flowers. They want clones and they want my seeds. So they ask where do I get that stuff in, Colorado?
[02:22.560 --> 02:26.520]  Unfortunately, once I sell the seeds, I don't know where they go
[02:26.520 --> 02:33.960]  So, I don't know what dispensary is growing my seeds my strains my clones. I don't know. I don't monitor the seeds
[02:33.960 --> 02:36.440]  I don't track the clones. I don't know where that stuff goes
[02:36.440 --> 02:42.100]  I don't know exactly what dispensary will have what products in stock on the shelf at any time
[02:42.140 --> 02:44.140]  I do know there are several
[02:44.660 --> 02:48.600]  commercial recreational and medical dispensaries throughout, Colorado that do have
[02:48.980 --> 02:53.660]  My clones my plants in there grows, but I can't promise you when it will be on the shelf
[02:53.660 --> 02:58.580]  They've got to grow it. They've got to harvest it dry it cure it manifest it transfer it over the store
[02:58.580 --> 03:00.860]  It's got to be on the shelf. It's got to be there when you get there
[03:00.860 --> 03:06.180]  I really have no way of knowing what happened. That's just it's their product once they've got the seeds
[03:06.180 --> 03:08.220]  It is theirs once you guys have purchased the seeds
[03:08.620 --> 03:12.100]  You can ask me questions about how to grow it and whatnot, but those are your seeds
[03:12.100 --> 03:13.940]  You can do whatever you want with them
[03:13.940 --> 03:18.380]  And yes, you do have my blessing to breed with the seeds that you get from me
[03:18.380 --> 03:20.580]  Please do breed with them in exchange
[03:20.580 --> 03:26.300]  Give me credit when you list the genetics on your pack at least put the proper strain name and then maybe send me a 10
[03:26.300 --> 03:27.940]  Pack of something if you bred something cool
[03:27.940 --> 03:33.900]  But I'm not sure where to get flowers or clones of my genetics in dispensaries in, Colorado
[03:34.660 --> 03:39.940]  Also, you cannot get my seeds in anywhere in Colorado just because of the way that Colorado law is set up
[03:40.260 --> 03:45.320]  There are some boundaries there. I do recommend the online vendors for seeds check out my website
[03:45.320 --> 03:51.300]  I read genetics calm that will give you a link to approximately seven vendors on there. We will be adding more
[03:51.980 --> 03:55.580]  Shortly, I'm just updating checking emails getting all that stuff caught up seeing what I can handle
[03:55.580 --> 03:59.340]  Honestly, I don't want to promise too many vendors things that I cannot send to them
[03:59.340 --> 04:05.840]  So the seeds are available on the internet. You've got to go to I read genetics calm maybe seeds here now calm
[04:06.260 --> 04:11.060]  Maybe dank seed store. There are a lot of different options. My website has a big list
[04:11.500 --> 04:16.500]  They will all have different stuff in stock. They'll be doing different deals different pricing. That is all up to them
[04:16.500 --> 04:21.060]  They run their business how they would like but their websites are all linked up to my website
[04:21.220 --> 04:25.020]  So the seeds you can get them on the website clones and flowers
[04:25.020 --> 04:30.020]  I do not know where to tell you to get clones or flowers or finished product. I will not ship you anything
[04:30.020 --> 04:32.860]  I will not mail you anything. I will not meet you anywhere for anything
[04:33.060 --> 04:38.220]  You've got to use the apps that are available to shop the dispensaries. There are a couple apps you can use
[04:38.220 --> 04:42.260]  I'm not sure what you like the best use the one you're using type in a strain name
[04:42.260 --> 04:47.100]  Look for a dispensary where you are or where you're going or in that area and see if it is available
[04:47.100 --> 04:53.020]  I know that randomly I don't endorse any specific dispensary. I just happen to know that occasionally
[04:53.020 --> 04:59.280]  Occasionally randomly a place called trench town has a couple of IRI genetic strains call before you drive
[04:59.860 --> 05:03.660]  They may not even tell you anything on the phone. You may have to check out the website or something
[05:03.820 --> 05:05.380]  They don't know that you're 21
[05:05.380 --> 05:09.940]  So when you call the dispensary and you say do you have this product and they say we can't tell you over the phone
[05:10.060 --> 05:15.340]  That's because you've got to be 21 to shop in the dispensary and they don't want to tell you anything if you're not 21
[05:15.340 --> 05:19.380]  They're trying to protect themselves. So don't think they're being a dick. Don't think they're being mean to you
[05:19.380 --> 05:22.740]  We're trying to keep our licenses. It costs a million bucks for that license
[05:22.740 --> 05:28.180]  We're not gonna give it away by giving dumb information over the phone. So don't feel like they're being disrespectful
[05:28.180 --> 05:31.220]  They're trying to cover their own ass. You may have to check a website. You may have to go there
[05:31.700 --> 05:37.180]  So trench town in Denver sometimes carries my products not my products my strains
[05:37.180 --> 05:41.980]  They have acquired either seeds or clones. I had nothing to do with it after that. They've grown it
[05:41.980 --> 05:45.540]  They have done their stuff with it. So that may be on the shelf
[05:45.540 --> 05:48.740]  They may have lemon Jeffrey at trench town in Denver
[05:48.980 --> 05:55.020]  Once again, check before you drive if you can kind love sometimes has lemon Jeffrey. It may be the same cut
[05:55.020 --> 05:59.120]  They may be sharing the same cut between trench town and kind love
[05:59.620 --> 06:04.040]  Also a long time ago three rivers in Pueblo had a rise
[06:04.040 --> 06:09.620]  I don't know if they've still got that it may have been removed. It may have still be that I don't know honestly
[06:09.620 --> 06:11.300]  But at one point in time it was there
[06:11.300 --> 06:15.300]  So check the website check the apps all those services before you go
[06:15.740 --> 06:20.300]  There are other spots in Colorado that may have my stuff, but really I don't know where to tell you to look
[06:20.860 --> 06:24.540]  Wherever you are if you're in Michigan, I know my stuff is available there if you're in, New Mexico
[06:25.220 --> 06:30.620]  Check out organ to cut they have got a lot of my products if you are in, New Mexico. Check out Everest
[06:31.660 --> 06:37.540]  Everest grew the shit out of some arise they won best sativa in the Chronicle magazine
[06:37.940 --> 06:44.140]  The bud bowl or something like that so the sativa first place was arise grown by Everest
[06:44.140 --> 06:47.700]  So check them out that light is bugging my left eye. It's making my eye twitch. I may edit that part out
[06:47.700 --> 06:48.780]  I may not
[06:48.780 --> 06:52.700]  So if you're in, New Mexico check out Everest, they've got the arise quite often
[06:52.700 --> 06:56.300]  I know that a lot of places across the country have got my product
[06:56.300 --> 07:00.220]  So just do the research you can check the websites check the apps again
[07:00.260 --> 07:04.860]  Don't rely on my advice because I'm telling you straight up. I can't promise you anything. I don't know
[07:05.460 --> 07:08.820]  Once it's like once I've sold the seed. I don't know where that seed goes
[07:08.820 --> 07:10.940]  You can grow it you can do whatever you want with it
[07:10.940 --> 07:15.380]  And then you can take thousands of clones from one plant, so I don't know where all of those clones end up
[07:15.380 --> 07:16.740]  I have no idea
[07:16.740 --> 07:19.380]  All right now to follow up on that a little bit
[07:19.740 --> 07:24.460]  Seeds here now calm should have a restock very soon by the time this episode drops
[07:24.540 --> 07:27.300]  There should be a restock at seeds here now calm
[07:27.820 --> 07:33.460]  They were running very very low on I read genetics products. I apologize that we let them get that low
[07:33.820 --> 07:38.700]  They were doing a website update they were doing some inventory updates. We were kind of in a holding position
[07:39.980 --> 07:44.980]  No more holding we have got them a restock by the time this episode comes out everything should be on the website
[07:45.500 --> 07:49.940]  Honestly a lot of the stuff will be resold out and we will be restocking it again
[07:50.100 --> 07:56.660]  We're going to do our best to keep the stock updated and in stock some things are honestly sold out. I have to make things
[07:58.120 --> 08:00.340]  Yeah, but we're gonna do our best to keep things updated
[08:00.340 --> 08:03.120]  I apologize for the low stock on seeds here now
[08:03.120 --> 08:08.300]  Make sure you do use coupon code GF why h10 while checking out at seeds here now that'll save you a 10%
[08:08.300 --> 08:11.360]  That may save you the cost of shipping if you're buying multiple packs
[08:11.540 --> 08:17.380]  They may buy you another pack of seeds so check out seeds here now calm. They should have a restock all right now
[08:17.380 --> 08:20.180]  Let's move forward to the main topics of today's podcast
[08:20.700 --> 08:25.940]  This section of the show is brought to you by my friend Billy podunk big shout out to my buddy Billy podunk for always
[08:25.940 --> 08:29.440]  Supporting the podcast. Thank you, bro. It's always good to see you in the discord
[08:29.440 --> 08:34.360]  I've got a couple of great messages here. I printed some stuff out the first one came from our friend
[08:34.360 --> 08:39.280]  They want their name said we're gonna say their name this one came from newbie nugs big up to newbie nugs
[08:39.640 --> 08:43.160]  Got a couple of things in this message. It says hey Rasta Jeff first of all
[08:43.160 --> 08:49.280]  Thank you for the amazing work. You do not only in your breeding, but also in the knowledge you share. Thank you
[08:49.280 --> 08:54.980]  I appreciate that I always say that those compliments are like recharge. It's like nutrients for my soul, so thank you
[08:54.980 --> 08:57.520]  I appreciate it, then it says I have a question
[08:58.480 --> 09:02.720]  Also says I've included a picture, but we don't know we don't need the picture here because I can explain this
[09:03.120 --> 09:07.120]  He explains to grow it says I'm running auto flowers for this setup. I got a 5x5
[09:07.680 --> 09:13.560]  He does talk about to grow he says so I filled this run with some bag of peel red and purples
[09:13.660 --> 09:19.320]  Now that I've been talking forever. Let's get into the question and all the environmentals that you care about I did skip some stuff there
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.760]  But it says this is an auto flower named red poison. It's from sweet seeds
[09:23.760 --> 09:29.560]  I says I know this breeder has many strains bred for the sole purpose of being red or purple. That's really cool
[09:29.560 --> 09:30.560]  We've got a breeder
[09:30.560 --> 09:36.440]  Breeding for the purpose of making a color if you're breeding have a purpose if they're starting out looking for color
[09:36.480 --> 09:40.660]  That's a great goal a great purpose great bag appeal that will make you stand out
[09:40.880 --> 09:46.400]  If you set three bags of herb on the table and yours is fucking bright red or bright purple someone's gonna grab that they're gonna
[09:46.400 --> 09:48.400]  Want to buy that shit it gets attention
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.800]  So you're hitting the bag appeal on nailing that one right on the are hitting that nail on the head
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.720]  Then it says these are almost five weeks old and as I popped into the tent to make an update for YouTube
[10:00.720 --> 10:05.460]  I see that two of these babies are pre flowering and I mean they're just hitting pre flowers
[10:05.460 --> 10:12.360]  The pistols are barely poking out and the color is wild and it's got exclamation points by the word color is wild
[10:12.520 --> 10:13.800]  Now here's the question
[10:13.800 --> 10:20.640]  It says my question is do you know what causes this or the reason that plants make colors and how it spreads into the veins?
[10:20.640 --> 10:27.080]  Of the leaves I've had many purplish strains, but this one looks like it is bleeding into the leaves fast
[10:27.080 --> 10:32.760]  Is it a chlorophyll type of chemical and then it says it could be genetic and then he lists his environment which
[10:33.640 --> 10:39.480]  We don't need to go too much further because you've already answered the question yourself. It is basically
[10:40.400 --> 10:44.120]  Similar to chlorophyll, but this is known as an antho cyan
[10:44.120 --> 10:46.080]  I had to print that word out because I've been saying it wrong
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.720]  I've just been calling it anthos because I wasn't sure how to say the last part because
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.940]  I've never had to say it out loud before honestly until today
[10:52.940 --> 10:58.360]  But what you're seeing is anthocyanin and is basically the purple version of chlorophyll
[10:58.360 --> 11:04.800]  It's the chlorophyll is what makes the leaves green anthocyanin is what is making that purple reddish color a lot of other
[11:05.400 --> 11:07.840]  Things have that pigment is what we're gonna call it
[11:08.520 --> 11:13.480]  Carrots were actually purple when they first started that's what gives beats that color. I think from what I've read
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.640]  They've got antho cyanin. It's blue violet or a red
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.280]  Flavonoid pigment found in plants is the definition of that. So that's what you're seeing
[11:23.880 --> 11:29.920]  And it's easy not easy. It's I guess it's easy to breed for that because it's visually
[11:30.600 --> 11:32.720]  Identifiable when you're breeding when you're growing plants
[11:32.720 --> 11:37.840]  That is a very easy visual indicator to identify like potency pest resistance
[11:39.320 --> 11:43.560]  Hermaphroditism, those are all traits. You've got to wait and find out for her mafra tism tism
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.960]  You will see that but you got to wait that orange purple different colors. That's a very visual thing
[11:48.960 --> 11:52.460]  You can definitely breed for that. You can select for that find those very early
[11:52.460 --> 11:57.440]  You know, if you're hitting your goal find breeding plants, that is very cool. So that's a really cool goal
[11:57.920 --> 12:03.740]  He's hitting the goal if you're getting plants with that many colors, so that is a successful breeding project in my opinion
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.760]  All right newbie nugs what you've got going on. There is antho cyanin. They're hitting their goal
[12:08.760 --> 12:14.920]  They bred for that red and purple color. It's popping up. That is exactly what you're seeing. Thank you for the great question, bro
[12:14.920 --> 12:20.080]  Thank you for the patreon support. If you've got any more questions, I do look forward to hearing from you
[12:20.080 --> 12:25.800]  All right. This one actually came from YouTube. I don't generally answer questions from the YouTube comments
[12:25.800 --> 12:30.200]  I happen to notice this one. It's not that I'm ignoring the YouTube comments
[12:30.200 --> 12:32.260]  there are just a lot of them and as a
[12:32.880 --> 12:34.880]  content creator
[12:35.040 --> 12:37.440]  we are taught not to read a lot of the comments because
[12:37.920 --> 12:40.560]  The comments are fucking where all the savagery
[12:40.840 --> 12:45.360]  Happens the comments are where the savagery happens that sentence wasn't as hard to say as it looked
[12:46.040 --> 12:49.340]  People aren't kind in the comments people don't give a shit in the comments
[12:49.340 --> 12:54.080]  So we don't read a lot of them because we just don't want to just why even delve into the negativity
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.560]  But I saw this one pop up. I actually got the email and it says just like this
[12:58.560 --> 13:03.580]  It's from our friend big Mike from Canada and it says great show as usual and it says question
[13:03.800 --> 13:10.440]  What are your smoke test processes once you have created a new strain? How long into curing it? Do you wait?
[13:10.800 --> 13:15.560]  Do you have smoke testers? Do you test the flowers only or to the concentrates?
[13:15.560 --> 13:18.160]  Also, do you wait for lab results?
[13:18.160 --> 13:19.240]  I would appreciate it
[13:19.240 --> 13:24.040]  If you could elaborate during a show for these important steps to choose for your keepers many
[13:24.040 --> 13:30.880]  Thanks in advance. Keep up the great work. You can mention my name. I'm big Mike from Canada big Mike from Canada
[13:30.880 --> 13:37.400]  These are great questions. Let's just get right to it. What are your smoke test processes once you've created a new strain?
[13:38.400 --> 13:41.820]  Basically chop it down dry and cure it and smoke it my favorite ways
[13:41.820 --> 13:47.680]  I would roll a fat joint of it pack a bowl of it pack a bong load of it. Then I'm gonna smoke it
[13:47.880 --> 13:50.960]  How long into curing do you wait
[13:52.080 --> 13:55.800]  Generally, I dry it. I cure it for maybe a week. Maybe two
[13:55.800 --> 13:59.160]  I am NOT one of those guys that does the ridiculously long cure
[13:59.160 --> 14:04.920]  I don't find it necessary to go a long time the chemical process. I'm looking for happened in about two weeks
[14:04.920 --> 14:10.080]  That's all I need out of that. Then I start smoking it. Sometimes. I don't wait that long. Um
[14:11.240 --> 14:15.760]  Do you have smoke testers? Yeah, everybody around here loves to be a smoke tester
[14:15.760 --> 14:18.900]  All I have to do is say hey, I got some new herb and the couches will be full
[14:19.480 --> 14:24.760]  People will invite me over I get really popular when they know that it is almost time to do some testing
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.400]  Some phenotype selections. Yeah, I've got a crew
[14:28.280 --> 14:31.440]  Shout out to the crew. They know who they are. By the way, Doug. I miss you, bro
[14:31.440 --> 14:36.680]  We need to get you back on the smoke testing team. If you still watch the show got to get you smoking again. Um
[14:37.480 --> 14:41.680]  Smoke testers. Yeah, shout out to all the test crew. They know who they are. Mike is one of the number one testers
[14:42.520 --> 14:43.840]  It's always up to me though
[14:43.840 --> 14:49.160]  I am I'm the fucking head motherfucker in charge if I decide that number six is the best and other people said that number three
[14:49.160 --> 14:53.720]  Was the best guess what number six is the winner because I'm the one that fucking I've got the goal
[14:53.720 --> 14:54.400]  I know the plan
[14:54.400 --> 14:59.740]  So I also know that that plant is gonna get bred to in the future and I've got other ulterior motives anyway
[15:00.160 --> 15:02.160]  Test crew. Yes. There is a test crew
[15:03.120 --> 15:08.200]  What's the next part? Do you test the flowers only or the concentrates? It depends on
[15:09.000 --> 15:12.140]  The timing if there's somebody around that can make concentrates for me
[15:12.140 --> 15:17.080]  Sometimes getting somebody to make some diamonds for me to make some sauce or batter is time-consuming and it does
[15:17.360 --> 15:23.160]  They do charge me for that. Sometimes it's not cost-effective. Sometimes there's not enough product to make it worth it
[15:23.240 --> 15:28.660]  sometimes I just grew a bunch of tiny tiny plants and we're just gonna smoke the flowers and see because that's really what matters if
[15:28.660 --> 15:30.200]  The flowers are no good
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.020]  Most of the customers are going to smoke it as a flower when they buy seeds from me
[15:35.180 --> 15:41.400]  Most of them are only gonna smoke as a flower only a small percentage of them will continue to make concentrates out of it
[15:41.620 --> 15:44.460]  I know most of what I make is going to make amazing
[15:44.740 --> 15:50.760]  Concentrates just because the potency and the turps that I've chosen for my breeding palette always make great concentrates
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.400]  So if it's available if it's an option, I do have concentrates made. Do you wait for lab results?
[15:56.400 --> 15:57.300]  That's a good question
[15:57.300 --> 16:02.380]  A lot of people are hyped up on lab results and I've started to care less and less about lab results. Um,
[16:03.380 --> 16:08.460]  I've never had a high-pressure liquid chromatography machine buy seeds from me
[16:08.460 --> 16:14.980]  I've never had a fucking lab device smoke weed with me and say that it was really good or really bad
[16:14.980 --> 16:21.740]  I don't smoke weed with machines. I don't grow weed for test results. I grow weed for fucking human results human consumers
[16:21.740 --> 16:25.620]  That's who is going to smoke it. Humans are gonna grow it humans are gonna smoke it
[16:25.620 --> 16:30.140]  I I appreciate what the lab says, but I'd rather hear what you've got to say
[16:30.140 --> 16:33.500]  I'd rather hear what Mike's got to say. I'd rather hear what Doug's got to say
[16:33.820 --> 16:37.180]  I'd rather hear what everybody in the smoke circles got to say about it
[16:37.300 --> 16:41.300]  Compared to what a fucking machine has to say about it. The machines are awesome. The testing is cool
[16:41.740 --> 16:49.660]  But what difference does it make if I smoke it Mike smokes it Kevin smokes it fucking Matt smokes it
[16:50.380 --> 16:54.380]  Everybody smokes it and we all say that sample number three is the winner
[16:54.380 --> 16:59.500]  But the lab tests show that sample number six has higher numbers who cares what the lab test said
[16:59.500 --> 17:03.500]  We all enjoyed number three better. We're the humans that are going to be consuming it
[17:03.900 --> 17:07.860]  I've never smoked a joint with a machine pretty sure I have I'm pretty sure I fucking
[17:07.980 --> 17:12.900]  Blew weed into a machine at the bowling alley when it wouldn't fucking work right one time and it worked it fixed that son-of-a-bitch
[17:12.900 --> 17:18.120]  But anyway, I don't worry too much about lab results in lab tests. I do love seeing a high number
[17:18.120 --> 17:21.980]  It definitely it works for marketing. I think the numbers are more for marketing
[17:21.980 --> 17:26.300]  We put the numbers on there people want to buy the seeds when they see a higher number at the dispensary
[17:26.460 --> 17:29.780]  People just straight-up say what's your concentrate with the highest THC?
[17:29.780 --> 17:34.980]  So those numbers are good for marketing good for advertising for me. It doesn't make a difference. I want
[17:35.500 --> 17:40.000]  I want more turps if the numbers super high in THC then where did the turps go?
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.860]  We need just lower the THC and put some turps in there for me and I'll be okay
[17:43.860 --> 17:48.200]  Um, there is more for this. I would appreciate if you could elaborate on this during a show
[17:48.200 --> 17:51.660]  I think I elaborated bro on these important steps for choosing keepers
[17:52.100 --> 17:56.260]  Choosing keepers, it's a lot of it is the smoke report, but a lot of it is how does it grow?
[17:56.260 --> 17:59.060]  Did it give me any problems any stress during the grow?
[17:59.060 --> 18:01.980]  Do I think that it's got traits that it's going to pass on?
[18:01.980 --> 18:06.620]  In the offspring if I breed to it that are going to give you problems as a consumer
[18:06.620 --> 18:11.580]  I want to make sure that you've got seeds that will be successful a lot of my decision making in
[18:12.140 --> 18:14.140]  Selection is for you
[18:15.060 --> 18:21.580]  You may not be the people purchasing the seeds may not be as experienced as you are
[18:21.660 --> 18:27.740]  You may not be as experienced of a grower as myself. You may not have thousands of hours thousands of crops under your belt
[18:27.740 --> 18:33.060]  You may not be a commercial grower with resources and space and fucking money for products
[18:33.060 --> 18:38.300]  This may be the only pack of seeds you can buy. This may be the first pack of seeds you bought
[18:38.300 --> 18:41.580]  This may be your first and last run at growing weed if you're not successful
[18:41.580 --> 18:46.460]  So I do my best to select plants that I know are going to make seeds
[18:46.460 --> 18:51.620]  They give you a good opportunity to grow. That's my main goal as a seed producer
[18:51.620 --> 18:57.580]  I'm not going to sell you the seed that you never get because it's kind of bread for me. That's my secret stash
[18:57.580 --> 19:03.740]  I kind of know that if I put like some chem 91 and some old OG kush shit together
[19:03.740 --> 19:06.060]  There's an opportunity for intersex traits there
[19:06.060 --> 19:11.260]  There's an opportunity for pain in the ass plants that stuff won't go anywhere that stays for me
[19:11.260 --> 19:16.420]  But the stuff that I'm breeding for you that I know is going to be commercially viable that I know I want to release to
[19:16.420 --> 19:18.980]  The masses I make sure that it's going to be successful
[19:18.980 --> 19:24.340]  Intergrower and then I know that the commercial grower the pro grower that my crew my friends are going to kill it
[19:24.340 --> 19:29.420]  They're gonna hit the numbers. They're gonna hit bonuses. Everyone's gonna eat fat. We're gonna get good concentrates
[19:29.460 --> 19:34.560]  So that's what I put out as my commercial seed line. I know you're gonna have success
[19:35.380 --> 19:39.220]  So that's a part of my selection for keepers then does it work?
[19:39.220 --> 19:43.980]  Well in my grow because I'm the one growing it. I got to keep it in my grow. Does it show me any problems?
[19:44.500 --> 19:49.580]  Does it breed well with other things it's got to be able to breed well with multiple different crosses
[19:49.580 --> 19:53.660]  Maybe can I reverse it that also helps me select a keeper as a breeder?
[19:53.660 --> 20:00.140]  I think my criteria for selecting keepers may be a little bit different than some people a lot of people are just looking for smoke
[20:00.140 --> 20:04.100]  a lot of people are looking for something that smokes well smells good looks good in the bag and
[20:04.660 --> 20:06.660]  Bottom line is does it pay the bills?
[20:06.660 --> 20:10.660]  So that's we're growing for different things. Our bottom line is a different thing
[20:10.660 --> 20:16.260]  So my selection may be a little bit different but as the breeder creating a product for you
[20:16.260 --> 20:18.060]  I understand your main goal
[20:18.060 --> 20:24.500]  So I think that helps a lot me understanding your goal providing a product for you to hit your goal helps out a lot
[20:24.500 --> 20:30.660]  So giant Mike that was a big Mike. That was a great question, bro. Thank you. Thanks for listening up there in Canada
[20:30.660 --> 20:34.140]  I do appreciate that. I'm making sure I answered all of your questions here
[20:34.140 --> 20:37.260]  I hit all the points the process bro roll it up and smoke it
[20:37.260 --> 20:39.260]  Roll a fat joint because I want to taste the flavor
[20:39.260 --> 20:45.420]  I want to taste the flavor down at the end smoke it in a bowl because generally if I'm smoking weed around the house
[20:45.420 --> 20:50.300]  It's in a bowl because I like to pack a bowl and I just set it in my lap and I fucking hit it now
[20:50.300 --> 20:52.420]  I put it in my lap and walk around with it
[20:52.420 --> 20:56.900]  And if I don't have nothing to do for a couple of seconds, I just hit a bowl and they just carry it around
[20:56.900 --> 20:58.900]  So I like to have weed and a pipe like that
[20:59.420 --> 21:02.220]  If I don't have a lot of time getting kind of older now
[21:02.220 --> 21:07.180]  I hate to admit it but hitting a bong kind of hurts sometimes but I like to have weed in a pipe
[21:07.260 --> 21:09.260]  But I like to take a big fat bong rip
[21:09.900 --> 21:15.820]  Get a lot of flavor get a lot of experience from that flower in a big fat bong rip and then of course make some
[21:15.820 --> 21:22.660]  Concentrates out of it. How long do I cure it? My products doesn't my products don't get cured for very long my personal stuff
[21:22.660 --> 21:25.020]  I don't believe in over curing. I don't think it's necessary
[21:25.620 --> 21:29.220]  The testers are the crew. I feel like I answered all of the points
[21:30.180 --> 21:33.300]  So big Mike, thank you, bro. I do appreciate it. Keep listening
[21:33.300 --> 21:39.500]  And if you've got more questions, please do send them my way and if everybody out there if you're not already subscribed to the YouTube channel

[21:54.540 --> 22:00.100]  We're gonna do this one. This is gonna be a longer podcast than I had anticipated. You're welcome. You deserve it
[22:00.260 --> 22:05.100]  This one came from our friend Jethro Earl 710, what up Jethro? Thank you for the great message
[22:05.580 --> 22:10.660]  This one says hey Rasta Jeff. Feel free to use my screen name if you read this on the show
[22:10.660 --> 22:11.860]  I already done that part
[22:11.860 --> 22:16.420]  It says I've been listening to your podcast for a few years now and I have to say it's helped me get through some long
[22:16.460 --> 22:17.940]  work days
[22:17.940 --> 22:19.820]  Bro, I know the feeling thank you
[22:19.820 --> 22:24.380]  Um, I listen to podcast too when I'm working and it does make a long day go quite quickly
[22:24.380 --> 22:29.580]  It says I give it five stars. Thank you. Please go rate it and review it wherever you're listening
[22:29.580 --> 22:35.220]  It says I was so excited to see you post my pictures of orange chasm if I'm posting your pictures
[22:35.220 --> 22:40.340]  They must have been beautiful says I've been wanting to ask you to do a show on photography for a while now
[22:40.580 --> 22:46.580]  Maybe some simple gear to get started. What do you use? Also some tips to make better social media posts?
[22:46.580 --> 22:50.420]  I've put in my tester application and right after you did that podcast
[22:50.420 --> 22:56.660]  Is there anything I could do differently to improve my chances to be selected? I'm just finishing up a run of orange chasm
[22:56.660 --> 23:01.700]  I now have strawberry starburst and veg blueberry butcher and sonic boom coming from seeds here now
[23:02.260 --> 23:07.500]  Then he gives us an email and then his cannabis eyes Jethro Earl 710 on cannabis
[23:07.500 --> 23:09.500]  You guys give him a follow make sure you check out cannabis
[23:09.700 --> 23:13.540]  Then he signs it keep up the good work from your friend and they sign it with his real name
[23:13.540 --> 23:16.620]  Which we're gonna leave out of the show. Hey, bro. Thank you. This is a great message
[23:17.300 --> 23:23.980]  I'm going to talk briefly about cannabis photography before I do that. I have got to tell you honestly straight-up
[23:24.580 --> 23:30.380]  100% I do not consider myself a photographer. I have got absolutely zero
[23:31.020 --> 23:37.100]  Photography training. I don't know what the numbers mean. I don't know what that stuff means on the camera
[23:37.460 --> 23:39.260]  Basically the way I've learned it
[23:39.260 --> 23:39.780]  I
[23:39.780 --> 23:40.820]  Got a camera
[23:40.820 --> 23:45.580]  Start a turn on the knobs turn one knob this way take a bunch of pictures and start turning the knob the other way
[23:45.580 --> 23:48.280]  And as it goes this way I paid attention to the changes in my photos
[23:48.420 --> 23:51.100]  Then I picked a different setting and set it all the way at one end
[23:51.220 --> 23:55.940]  Started taking pictures take a couple and switch the settings this way as I go and pay attention to the differences
[23:56.060 --> 24:00.860]  Then learn how those two settings kind of work with each other. That's how I learned photography
[24:00.860 --> 24:04.580]  I know that's not the way to do it, but that is kind of how I learned stuff
[24:04.940 --> 24:09.740]  I've been learning under the gun. I got a camera and I thought I want to take pictures and I started shooting pictures
[24:09.740 --> 24:14.220]  They went online immediately. My photos got better. I just kept doing it as I was learning
[24:14.220 --> 24:17.260]  I never stopped to like take a class or learn anything
[24:17.860 --> 24:20.700]  Then I ended up doing a podcast ended up doing a video podcast
[24:20.780 --> 24:27.740]  I'm learning the video production the same exact way I produce the shows I edit them and then as I'm producing and editing them
[24:27.740 --> 24:31.620]  I learned mistakes. I made corrections. I can make improvements. I can make as I go
[24:31.620 --> 24:36.380]  That is how I learned photography video production podcasting. So I learned cannabis growing
[24:36.380 --> 24:39.120]  I did a lot of reading and research on cannabis growing because I was
[24:39.740 --> 24:45.780]  Completely passionate about it, but photography just came kind of naturally to me. I don't know what I'm doing
[24:45.780 --> 24:50.060]  I don't know how to take pictures of anything but cannabis plants and sneakers
[24:50.060 --> 24:51.980]  That is what I can take pictures of
[24:51.980 --> 24:55.380]  If you sign me up to be the photographer at your wedding or at a birthday party
[24:55.380 --> 25:00.700]  You're gonna be fucking mad because I don't know what I'm doing. Like I honestly I just have a good eye for the shot
[25:00.700 --> 25:05.220]  I know what I want. I've looked at magazines long enough to see what works well
[25:05.740 --> 25:07.740]  But honestly, I don't know what I'm doing
[25:08.300 --> 25:14.040]  Technically, there's no schooling behind it. It's all just hey, that's a good image. Let's catch that. So that is my disclaimer
[25:14.040 --> 25:18.520]  I am NOT a photographer. I play with a camera. So one of the first things you said
[25:19.240 --> 25:19.840]  Let's see
[25:19.840 --> 25:23.200]  One of the first things you want to know about some simple tips with gear to get started
[25:23.440 --> 25:29.320]  Honest, bro. Most of my photos are done with an iPhone 8 plus that is honest
[25:29.320 --> 25:37.040]  I've got this 8 plus and I love it for photography. It works very it's simple. I also have a Canon
[25:37.840 --> 25:43.120]  No, it's a Nikon d3200. Sorry my brain farted right there. I have a Nikon d3200
[25:43.120 --> 25:48.480]  That is kind of an older camera. I've got two lenses for it. One is close up and one is further away
[25:48.480 --> 25:53.280]  I use the further away lens and zoom in really close and I get beautiful shots
[25:53.280 --> 25:59.560]  It's a Nikon d3200 not a super expensive camera kind of an older camera. That's what I learned with
[25:59.560 --> 26:03.940]  That is how I learned how to take photos of cannabis a lot of the stuff you see
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.120]  From commercial grows that I post is with a Nikon d3200
[26:08.480 --> 26:11.160]  Now it's a very affordable camera because it's kind of old
[26:11.760 --> 26:14.240]  I do not use the auto settings
[26:14.240 --> 26:15.680]  I've learned a couple of settings on there
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.140]  Once you get your aperture setting right and your ISO setting right you'll learn exactly how to shoot in a grow room
[26:21.720 --> 26:29.320]  So what I'm getting at now, I've upgraded I've actually got the the Sony a6400 which takes beautiful pictures
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.280]  But I prefer it for the video camera. It doesn't move a lot right now that I've got it set up in the video spot
[26:33.280 --> 26:36.640]  It's beautiful, but that's what I'm using now. You don't see a lot of photos from that
[26:37.480 --> 26:41.720]  Most of it comes from the Nikon because it's a that's actually kept near the grow space
[26:42.200 --> 26:48.240]  so what I was gonna get out with that the most important part about your photography equipment in my opinion is
[26:48.840 --> 26:55.720]  understand the tool you have got if you're using an iPhone if you're using an Android phone if you're using a Canon camera a
[26:55.760 --> 27:01.280]  Nikon camera a Sony camera learn that device, but I don't think you
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.600]  Need a device that is above your skill level. I've got the Sony
[27:07.480 --> 27:14.800]  Which is this one the a6400 the a7 III would take a much better photo a much better video
[27:14.960 --> 27:20.800]  But it's got so many buttons and so many settings that I think it would just stumble me
[27:20.800 --> 27:24.960]  It would trip me up and confuse me more than it would help me to be productive
[27:24.960 --> 27:30.480]  I've got the highest camera that I think I could understand to be productive in a couple of years
[27:30.480 --> 27:32.800]  Once I understand all these settings and tools and tricks
[27:32.800 --> 27:36.840]  I will upgrade to that a7 III by then there'll be something better out. It'll be the a
[27:37.440 --> 27:41.520]  Fucking 22 5 or some shit. We'll get that one. But you see what I'm saying
[27:42.440 --> 27:47.760]  Just get the best tool that you can understand. I am NOT a professional guitar player
[27:47.760 --> 27:52.840]  So I don't have fucking Les Paul guitars and amplifiers everywhere. I'm a half-assed guitar player
[27:52.840 --> 27:57.400]  So I've got a Yamaha acoustic on a stand that's dusty get the best that you can handle
[27:57.400 --> 28:00.060]  Don't get something out of your league. That's gonna intimidate you
[28:00.720 --> 28:03.240]  Cameras can be confusing if you don't know what you're doing
[28:03.240 --> 28:07.620]  I honestly don't know what any of those buttons and settings mean I had to learn all of that stuff on the fly
[28:08.200 --> 28:10.920]  I learned all of it on YouTube, honestly
[28:10.960 --> 28:16.480]  So no know the gear that you've got learn the gear that you've got the best. It's not about having the best gear
[28:16.480 --> 28:18.960]  It's about mastering the gear that you do have
[28:20.440 --> 28:25.680]  Then where are we gonna go? There's a big learning curve when you do get a new camera
[28:25.760 --> 28:30.440]  You're gonna think oh, I'm gonna point this camera at the fucking plants and take a picture
[28:30.800 --> 28:36.760]  there are so many settings to play with like I talked about before that you're gonna have to figure out how to shoot in your
[28:36.920 --> 28:38.920]  environment a big tip and
[28:39.920 --> 28:41.200]  You can't do this everywhere
[28:41.200 --> 28:47.240]  If I did this in some commercial environments the lead grower the owner would come and throw a fucking fit turn off the grow lights
[28:47.240 --> 28:51.100]  In my personal grow space island plug the grow lights when I'm taking pictures now
[28:51.100 --> 28:57.980]  It's dark in there and I turn on a fluorescent light and we just got normal white lighting in the room the 4800 the 48k
[28:58.340 --> 29:03.580]  4800 Kelvin that's what I'm looking for that color looks really good for photography and for lighting
[29:03.580 --> 29:04.580]  That's what I got going on right here
[29:04.580 --> 29:08.980]  Those are at 4,800 K is what I believe the lighting in front of me is the one behind me different spectrum
[29:08.980 --> 29:12.100]  Don't judge me by that one. I just did that for ambience behind me these two in front
[29:12.780 --> 29:16.240]  4,800 K is where they are set. I think that's a beautiful color for photography
[29:16.660 --> 29:20.420]  So just use a fluorescent light turn off the grow lights use a fluorescent light in there
[29:20.940 --> 29:22.940]  The more lighting the better
[29:23.980 --> 29:25.980]  Let's talk about the shot. Um
[29:27.340 --> 29:33.160]  It doesn't matter how good your gear is if you can't frame a shot if you don't can't get your subject, right?
[29:33.160 --> 29:36.480]  You're not gonna take a good photo. Think look at what you're shooting
[29:36.480 --> 29:38.020]  Think about the subject
[29:38.020 --> 29:44.520]  Get the subject in the shot and then don't have a bunch of extra stuff in the shot if you can clean up the background
[29:44.520 --> 29:47.020]  I know where a lot of us are taking pictures in the garden
[29:47.020 --> 29:52.100]  We're in the grow so we can't just move everything out of the background if you can move that plant in front of a background
[29:52.100 --> 29:54.900]  like this curtain behind me or a cool color or a
[29:55.180 --> 29:58.980]  contrasting color something that's not green if you can put it in front of black or purple or
[29:59.100 --> 30:03.380]  Blue or something like that to make the greens and the Reds pop out. That's always a good idea
[30:03.380 --> 30:08.460]  Don't put it right against the background put it about a foot off of the background and lots of lighting
[30:08.460 --> 30:11.860]  But think about what's behind that picture
[30:11.860 --> 30:17.020]  Do you want to see like a bunch of crates and five-gallon buckets and maybe the toilet or something like that?
[30:17.020 --> 30:19.380]  You don't want to see all that dumb shit in the background. We want to see a beautiful
[30:19.900 --> 30:25.100]  Pleasing picture everything in the picture should catch my eye and make me go. Oh, that's a nice shot
[30:25.100 --> 30:31.700]  We don't need to see your pH pen. That's all crusty and the floor that's dirty and shit like that. Give us a pleasant shot
[30:37.070 --> 30:40.830]  What's the goal of your shot what are you trying to show me what do you want me to see as
[30:41.430 --> 30:48.190]  The photographer it's your responsibility to show me what you wanted me to see all I've got is this picture
[30:48.190 --> 30:52.350]  You're not gonna be there to say look at those trichomes if you want me to look at those trichomes
[30:52.670 --> 30:55.190]  Get those trichomes in the shot. That's all you got to do
[30:55.230 --> 31:00.950]  The one picture is your opportunity to tell me the story so frame it the way you want it get it framed up in there
[31:00.990 --> 31:02.750]  Like the shot you're looking at right now
[31:02.750 --> 31:05.570]  There's not a bunch of junk in the background not a bunch of junk on the sides
[31:05.710 --> 31:09.070]  If you do take a picture and there's a bunch of shit on the sides of your picture
[31:09.070 --> 31:13.230]  Don't be afraid to crop it. You could trim out the sides of your pictures like over here off-camera
[31:13.270 --> 31:18.630]  There's some recording equipment. You can't even see you think this room looks super clean and organized. No, there's a mess right there
[31:18.630 --> 31:22.950]  You can't even see it, but we just crop it out make it look super good and super professional
[31:23.070 --> 31:25.470]  Nobody has to know about that stuff unless you tell them
[31:26.070 --> 31:31.570]  So make the shot pleasing frame it have a good angle. Have a good background think about good colors
[31:32.430 --> 31:38.190]  Colors that contrast your plant colors that complement your plant. What are you trying to highlight? I've talked about this a little bit
[31:38.190 --> 31:40.990]  Are you trying to highlight the trichomes the colors the leaf shape?
[31:41.430 --> 31:47.870]  The density of the buzz are you trying to show me the whole plant get what you want in that shot step back step forward
[31:47.870 --> 31:50.550]  Move around don't be afraid to move around in the grow
[31:50.550 --> 31:51.710]  Sometimes I'll be in there
[31:51.710 --> 31:56.710]  Hanging off of a step ladder with one foot on the step ladder and one foot against the wall leaning up against the door
[31:57.030 --> 31:59.470]  Fucking precariously trying to get these shots
[32:00.390 --> 32:03.110]  Get the shots you need get in there take that shot
[32:03.390 --> 32:07.070]  Then when it's time when it's possible move that plant somewhere better
[32:07.070 --> 32:11.830]  So you can put it in front of a good background put it about a foot off of the background put some good lighting
[32:11.830 --> 32:14.430]  On it then start getting photos there. Um
[32:15.430 --> 32:21.710]  Lighting lighting lighting lighting is amazing. The more lighting the better in my opinion
[32:21.710 --> 32:24.510]  You can't add light to a photo once you take it
[32:24.510 --> 32:30.390]  You can adjust the exposure a little bit, but you can't add lighting to a photo. You can take lighting out later
[32:30.390 --> 32:32.390]  so the more lighting is
[32:32.550 --> 32:34.310]  Fucking the better in my opinion
[32:34.310 --> 32:35.270]  That's what I'm getting at
[32:35.270 --> 32:41.150]  Lighting lighting lighting light it from all angles if you can light it from the bottom up from the back forward from the front back
[32:41.150 --> 32:45.270]  The more lighting the better that takes out your shadows that takes out all the weirdness
[32:45.270 --> 32:50.870]  It makes it easier to edit then later on when you learn photo stacking. You've just got so many more options
[32:50.870 --> 32:52.590]  We're not even gonna talk about photo stacking now
[32:52.590 --> 32:53.750]  That's a whole nother ballgame
[32:53.750 --> 32:57.470]  Shout out to the people who try to teach me that that I just simply don't have the patience for it
[32:57.470 --> 33:01.710]  I get it, but that's a lot of time you photographers are crazy. Um
[33:02.390 --> 33:08.470]  Lighting lighting lighting light that shit up. The 4,800 Kelvin lighting is beautiful put a light in front of it
[33:09.150 --> 33:12.010]  Maybe take a couple of pictures with your flash and see what it does
[33:12.010 --> 33:15.830]  Take a couple of pictures without the flash and see what it does. You're gonna notice a huge difference
[33:16.310 --> 33:22.410]  If the lighting is not right, the flash is going to give you shadows see where that shadow lies adjust your lighting there
[33:22.410 --> 33:27.110]  I've got two lights in front of me and a light behind me for this recording the light behind me
[33:27.350 --> 33:31.190]  Separates me from my background. I think it gives me a little bit of depth when you put the plants
[33:31.990 --> 33:37.150]  To the background and a light between them it'll provide depth it'll cut out a bunch of shadows. That'll work really well
[33:37.150 --> 33:39.610]  That's a big photography secret put a light behind you
[33:40.790 --> 33:43.830]  So the beauty the beauty about photography now
[33:44.550 --> 33:48.750]  We've come a long way. We're digital. We've got memory cards back in the day
[33:49.030 --> 33:53.390]  Every photo costed you money costed money. Is that the appropriate is costed a word?
[33:53.390 --> 33:55.150]  I don't know back in the day
[33:55.150 --> 34:01.950]  Every photo was an expense because film wasn't free every photo went on to a piece of film and it had to be developed in
[34:01.950 --> 34:07.130]  A dark room somebody had to go develop that film that got expensive that got time-consuming now
[34:07.130 --> 34:11.150]  It's all digital now just fucking spray and pray and take a bunch of shots
[34:11.430 --> 34:16.170]  Take get the angle you want set your camera up where you want it get your subject where you want it for this
[34:16.170 --> 34:21.070]  We're just gonna say that my hand right here is my subject and my microphone is my camera get it set up
[34:21.230 --> 34:25.130]  Take a couple of shots chop chop chop. You got the shot you want right now change the setting
[34:25.270 --> 34:29.430]  Just change one or two settings a couple of directions take a couple more shots chop chop chop
[34:30.110 --> 34:32.390]  Change the setting a couple more times take a couple more
[34:32.630 --> 34:36.910]  Then when you're going through later on and looking at your photos that one that shines for you
[34:36.910 --> 34:42.790]  If you've got a good camera the settings will pop up on the camera and show you what settings you use to take that photo
[34:43.170 --> 34:48.150]  Now is your chance to grab a pen and write down those settings and duplicate those settings the next time you go into the grow
[34:48.150 --> 34:51.030]  room just go in there and change that setting again or
[34:51.550 --> 34:56.310]  Put your camera on auto and go into the room and take a couple of shots and then once it's on auto
[34:56.310 --> 35:00.790]  It's gonna adjust itself for you find the setting you want and then kind of mimic that and play with it from there later
[35:00.790 --> 35:03.390]  I like to use the macro mode on the camera
[35:03.390 --> 35:07.490]  It's the one with a little tiny flower on it and gets me nice and close gets me some good close shots
[35:07.490 --> 35:10.190]  If I'm backing up, I generally use that portrait mode
[35:10.750 --> 35:12.750]  You'll learn your camera
[35:13.350 --> 35:17.190]  One of the funnest parts about cameras and photography is there are no rules
[35:17.190 --> 35:22.310]  The only rules are like don't take pictures of the wrong person at the wrong time and don't get yourself in trouble you fucking creep
[35:22.310 --> 35:26.910]  But the main part about photography, there's no rules take pictures and have a good time. You're not hurting anything
[35:26.910 --> 35:27.910]  It doesn't cost you a lot
[35:27.910 --> 35:31.110]  Once you got the gear the memory card is in there snap snap snap
[35:31.510 --> 35:36.530]  Take a bunch of shots delete the ones you don't like repeat the process get better get more comfortable
[35:37.270 --> 35:40.150]  Eventually, you'll get to where you get us walk in you can set up your camera to go
[35:40.150 --> 35:42.350]  Oh, look, there's the shot that we need and you take two shots
[35:42.430 --> 35:44.430]  You move over and you go
[35:44.430 --> 35:45.730]  And you go, thank you guys
[35:45.730 --> 35:46.750]  I was ten thousand dollars
[35:46.750 --> 35:48.750]  They pay you ten G's and you go back to your
[35:48.910 --> 35:53.390]  Studio and you edit a couple things for a couple of seconds and you send them their fucking pristine photos
[35:53.390 --> 35:57.830]  I only took you two shots because you knew exactly what you were looking for. You developed that photographers
[35:57.830 --> 35:59.750]  I you just look at a shot and you go
[35:59.750 --> 36:04.230]  Oh that looks good right there the way that plant shines right there the way that leaf goes that direction in that direction
[36:04.790 --> 36:09.710]  You'll learn get this part of the plan in there and kind of crop this part out because it makes me want to see more
[36:09.710 --> 36:14.070]  Get just the top of the bud in there and leave a little top for visual like you'll start seeing it
[36:14.070 --> 36:16.870]  Then you'll learn the camera setting you'll say oh, there's this much light in here
[36:16.870 --> 36:19.510]  I want to get this much depth in here. I should use this lens
[36:19.590 --> 36:25.150]  Let's go shebang and you'll take two shots like a fucking sniper sniper gets one shot. I want two angles
[36:25.390 --> 36:30.030]  We're hitting two targets here. So shot move over shot again. Go home make your money
[36:30.550 --> 36:36.130]  So I am NOT a professional photographer. I told you what I do. That's what you asked for
[36:36.130 --> 36:40.630]  I can't teach you what a professional photographer does. I do not claim to be a professional photog
[36:41.170 --> 36:42.490]  That is not what I do
[36:42.490 --> 36:47.430]  I'm a guy with a camera who's passionate about cannabis who wanted to share those photos with my friends
[36:47.430 --> 36:52.170]  I just learned how to take pictures because of that. So I'm gonna make sure I answer the questions
[36:52.530 --> 36:58.930]  What do you use iPhone Nikon and a Canon some tips tips for better social media posts?
[36:59.610 --> 37:02.970]  That's a little tiny square. What are you trying to show me in that little tiny square?
[37:02.970 --> 37:09.050]  If you look at most of my photos, I am a seed maker who is trying to highlight my seed brand
[37:09.050 --> 37:15.250]  I'm showing you the colors the textures the trichome level of the plants that are coming from my seeds
[37:15.250 --> 37:18.210]  I try to have a good clear background without a bunch of shit in the background
[37:18.850 --> 37:22.370]  Good clear solid post that shows you exactly what you're looking at
[37:22.410 --> 37:27.810]  Then I try to use somewhere between three and five hashtags if you use the same hashtag too many times
[37:27.810 --> 37:34.170]  They'll start blocking that hashtag. They'll shadow ban it won't get seen so rotate your hashtags pick three or five and stick with them
[37:34.650 --> 37:40.770]  Also before you use those hashtags search them see if they have been shadow banned or blocked because they're blocking a lot of the cannabis
[37:40.770 --> 37:45.490]  Community popular hashtags on social media now, so make sure they aren't blocked
[37:45.490 --> 37:49.210]  Also, I've noticed that my stories get viewed more than my posts
[37:49.210 --> 37:53.330]  So maybe post in your stories post a post on Instagram then share it to your story
[37:53.850 --> 37:58.130]  Stories and posts with the location definitely get more views. That's something that I've noticed
[37:59.210 --> 38:02.050]  Where are we with that tips for more social media?
[38:02.050 --> 38:06.810]  I think that's what I've got for you for the best social media post put in my tester application
[38:06.810 --> 38:12.330]  Is there anything I could do to improve my chances right now? I'm taking a break from selecting testers because I've got
[38:13.210 --> 38:14.410]  I'm in over my head
[38:14.410 --> 38:18.710]  I got a lot going on and I don't want to commit to sending out a bunch of test seeds to people right now
[38:18.710 --> 38:22.050]  I've got enough out there. I'm getting reports. I've got enough going on
[38:22.050 --> 38:25.050]  But I've got you written down. I know who you are
[38:25.050 --> 38:30.770]  Now you are now on my radar radar when it comes time to selecting testers. Your name does look familiar
[38:31.450 --> 38:37.210]  That does help you out a lot. And I also now I know that you're on patreon. That does help out a lot as well
[38:37.810 --> 38:42.490]  Jethro Earl, thank you, bro. You gave me a good question to ramble on. I hope I answered some questions
[38:43.050 --> 38:49.210]  Honestly, I think honesty is the best policy. I am NOT a trained educated skilled photographer
[38:49.450 --> 38:54.050]  I am just I'm an idiot with a lot of experience to be quite honest with you
[38:54.050 --> 38:56.190]  I just did it until I figured it out
[38:56.190 --> 38:57.170]  I failed a few times
[38:57.170 --> 39:01.650]  But the best part about failing with photography is all you got to do is delete a couple photos. Nothing went wrong
[39:01.930 --> 39:06.170]  Just wasted some space on a memory card a couple of flashes on the flash is all so
[39:06.690 --> 39:12.010]  Yeah, get experienced to get there and take pictures and then watch the settings that work for you modify repeat
[39:12.690 --> 39:17.410]  Adjust and adapt and most importantly dude have fun with it. Have fun
[39:17.490 --> 39:24.610]  We've all been programmed and brainwashed to make all of our posts look exactly the same for social media when we scroll through social media
[39:24.610 --> 39:28.490]  It all looks basically the same. There's a little we've all got the same filters
[39:28.570 --> 39:35.490]  There's like a little we're all we've all fallen into an algorithm accidentally to make our photos pleasing and appealing for social media
[39:36.490 --> 39:41.730]  Get away from that and have fun take pictures of what you love snap the images that you see
[39:41.730 --> 39:46.770]  That's what that's the beauty of the camera. You've got the camera you get to capture what you see
[39:46.770 --> 39:50.770]  So get it the best you can it's like playing an instrument when I first got drums
[39:50.770 --> 39:53.450]  I didn't know how to say what I was thinking on the drums
[39:53.450 --> 39:55.930]  I would think book it to catch a doom doom pow and I would play it
[39:55.930 --> 39:59.450]  It would say but now I could say book it to catch a boom boom pow
[39:59.450 --> 40:03.210]  And then I could say well, how about chicka chicka peck it to deck it to deck a pile on top of it?
[40:03.210 --> 40:05.050]  And I can think it and play it now
[40:05.050 --> 40:09.370]  Eventually, you'll get the same way with your camera. You'll say ooh, I see that shot. I want to get lighting here
[40:09.370 --> 40:14.290]  I want to get these colors. I want this texture hit these buttons. Turn this knob zoom in chip chop. You got it
