[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  All right, here we go.
[00:11.280 --> 00:12.280]  Let's see how this goes.
[00:12.280 --> 00:13.800]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:13.800 --> 00:18.520]  I was setting up the recording equipment and I just happened to notice that it is 418 in
[00:18.520 --> 00:23.200]  Colorado, so happy pre-420 mountain time.
[00:23.200 --> 00:25.920]  Let's smoke a dab and then let's do a podcast.
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.720]  I'm getting myself together a dab right now.
[00:27.720 --> 00:31.240]  I'm working on some Double OG Full Spectrum Extract.
[00:31.240 --> 00:34.080]  It is a blend of Legend OG and Sour Double.
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.840]  The package says it should taste like pine, sour, and lemons.
[00:37.840 --> 00:42.560]  The back of the package says 62.03% THC.
[00:42.560 --> 00:44.320]  We are rapidly approaching 420.
[00:44.320 --> 00:45.600]  I'm getting my shit together.
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.240]  I'm going to start heating up this dab meal and we're going to take a dab and then we
[00:49.240 --> 00:50.720]  are going to do a podcast.
[00:50.720 --> 00:53.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for jumping in.
[00:53.400 --> 00:54.720]  Thanks for hanging out with me.
[00:54.720 --> 00:58.600]  I'm just rambling while I heat up this dab meal, get it nice and hot so we can take a
[00:58.600 --> 00:59.600]  dab together.
[00:59.600 --> 01:00.600]  I'm keeping an eye on the time.
[01:00.600 --> 01:04.080]  We've got just a few seconds and it is going to be 420.
[01:04.080 --> 01:08.200]  All right, I feel like this dab meal should be getting hot enough.
[01:08.200 --> 01:10.040]  That should be plenty of heat for now.
[01:10.040 --> 01:11.280]  We're going to take a fat dab.
[01:11.280 --> 01:12.680]  Let that cool down for just a couple of seconds.
[01:12.680 --> 01:14.800]  I don't need to roast my lungs off here.
[01:14.800 --> 01:16.320]  Give that just a few seconds.
[01:16.320 --> 01:18.040]  I'm just going to ramble while it cools down.
[01:18.040 --> 01:19.880]  I don't need my dab meal super hot.
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.680]  I just want it hot enough to roast this dab.
[01:21.840 --> 01:25.720]  When I put the carb cap on, I want it to get nice and milky thick with smoke.
[01:25.720 --> 01:28.520]  We're just about to the ideal temperature here.
[01:28.520 --> 01:29.520]  It is 420.
[01:29.520 --> 01:32.480]  The clock has struck 420.
[01:32.480 --> 01:34.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, let's take a dab together.
[01:34.920 --> 01:35.920]  Happy 420.
[01:50.420 --> 01:52.220]  All right, that is a tasty dab.
[01:52.220 --> 01:56.660]  That is the double OG full spectrum extract from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[01:56.660 --> 01:58.180]  It's got me talking a little bit funny.
[01:58.180 --> 01:59.500]  It makes me want to choke.
[01:59.500 --> 02:02.140]  I'm definitely getting the dab sweats.
[02:02.140 --> 02:03.500]  That is some delicious concentrate.
[02:03.500 --> 02:08.620]  I can feel every milligram of THC flowing through my brain and body.
[02:08.620 --> 02:09.660]  Oh, that's effective.
[02:09.660 --> 02:13.220]  All right, let's try to get my shit together and start a podcast.
[02:13.220 --> 02:14.940]  Here we go just like this.
[02:14.940 --> 02:16.300]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[02:16.300 --> 02:20.660]  It is time for episode 509 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:20.660 --> 02:25.260]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at seedsherenow.com.

[02:53.460 --> 02:56.900]  Since I like to stick with traditions, let's talk about what I'm smoking.
[02:56.900 --> 03:02.300]  You guys just heard me take a fat dab of Double OG Full Spectrum Extract from Green Dot Labs.
[03:02.300 --> 03:05.900]  Again, it is a blend of Legend OG and Sour Double.
[03:05.900 --> 03:10.340]  On the package, the flavor is described as pine, sour, and lemon.
[03:10.340 --> 03:13.540]  When I first hit it, I got that pine straight to the face.
[03:13.540 --> 03:17.580]  While the smoke was in my face, while it was in my lungs, and as it came out of my mouth,
[03:17.580 --> 03:19.800]  I certainly did taste that sour.
[03:19.800 --> 03:21.980]  It was piney and sour coming out.
[03:21.980 --> 03:27.740]  Now that it's been a couple of seconds, my mouth and the room taste and smell like lemons.
[03:27.740 --> 03:32.980]  So I will agree that that is a perfect description, pine, sour, and lemons.
[03:32.980 --> 03:38.580]  That also might be three of my favorite combinations together for a flavor and a concentrate.
[03:38.580 --> 03:44.620]  This stuff tastes delicious, and obviously, I am heavily medicated because I cannot stop
[03:44.620 --> 03:45.820]  rambling.
[03:45.820 --> 03:52.740]  So big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the Double OG Full Spectrum Extract.
[03:52.740 --> 03:56.900]  Alright all you freaky people, in this episode, I'm going to read an email from one of our
[03:56.900 --> 03:57.900]  friends.
[03:57.900 --> 04:02.940]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends who support the show
[04:02.940 --> 04:04.780]  on Patreon.
[04:04.780 --> 04:08.200]  Let's start off with a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast thank you shout out to my buddy
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.200]  Baked PWN.
[04:10.200 --> 04:14.140]  I want to send a special high five thank you shout out to my good friend Dick Goals.
[04:14.140 --> 04:17.420]  I always need to send a big fist bump to my buddy Glenn Geroni.
[04:17.420 --> 04:20.420]  I also want to send a thank you shout out to my buddy Steve F.
[04:20.420 --> 04:23.620]  I always want to pass a bowl over to my buddy Bafsta.
[04:23.620 --> 04:26.540]  Let's send a big thank you dab to my friend Sephirot.
[04:26.540 --> 04:29.380]  Also let's send a big thank you shout out to our buddy Freak Fish.
[04:29.380 --> 04:33.460]  I always want to send a big special thank you to my friend Gramps Richard Memmel.
[04:33.460 --> 04:35.740]  How about a big thank you shout out to Rick Roller.
[04:35.740 --> 04:40.580]  And I also want to send a big special thank you shout out and a high five to my buddy
[04:40.580 --> 04:42.020]  Bong Breath.
[04:42.020 --> 04:47.420]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[05:33.660 --> 05:38.440]  And you guys, I get a lot of emails and messages from people who say that they want to contribute
[05:38.440 --> 05:43.160]  to Patreon in the future, but they are not in a financial situation to help out right
[05:43.160 --> 05:44.160]  now.
[05:44.160 --> 05:45.160]  That is okay.
[05:45.160 --> 05:49.400]  Do not stress yourself out over helping my Patreon campaign.
[05:49.400 --> 05:53.280]  I don't expect anything in return for this podcast.
[05:53.280 --> 05:56.480]  I do this podcast because I was given a gift.
[05:56.480 --> 06:01.400]  I learned the ability, the skills, the art of growing cannabis very quickly.
[06:01.400 --> 06:03.200]  It came to me very naturally.
[06:03.200 --> 06:05.880]  I got plants and they flowered and looked amazing.
[06:05.880 --> 06:07.640]  I didn't have any problems in my first run.
[06:07.840 --> 06:10.280]  I did have spider mites, but we got rid of them pretty quickly.
[06:10.280 --> 06:12.560]  In my very first personal grow, I had spider mites.
[06:12.560 --> 06:13.560]  We got rid of them.
[06:13.560 --> 06:14.560]  Not a big deal.
[06:14.560 --> 06:19.440]  I feel like I've been very blessed with my ability to cultivate cannabis on the level
[06:19.440 --> 06:21.240]  on which I'm able to do so.
[06:21.240 --> 06:23.280]  I've been able to do it in personal grows.
[06:23.280 --> 06:25.840]  I've been blessed with large commercial facilities.
[06:25.840 --> 06:30.140]  I'm able to travel to different states and different locations and see their cultivation
[06:30.140 --> 06:35.240]  facilities and learn how they do things, and also offer help and opportunities to improve
[06:35.240 --> 06:36.500]  their facilities.
[06:36.500 --> 06:38.260]  I've been very blessed.
[06:38.260 --> 06:41.980]  I also feel like I am very blessed to have this gift of communication.
[06:41.980 --> 06:43.660]  I feel like I speak pretty well.
[06:43.660 --> 06:47.420]  I feel like I speak in a way that a lot of people can communicate with me.
[06:47.420 --> 06:50.620]  I feel like the dudes and hippies, they can talk to me.
[06:50.620 --> 06:52.500]  I feel like the young ladies can talk to me.
[06:52.500 --> 06:53.820]  I feel like grandma can talk to me.
[06:53.820 --> 06:58.160]  I feel like the gangsters and whoever else, we can all understand the way that I speak.
[06:58.160 --> 07:02.340]  If you're from the East Coast, the West Coast, maybe from other countries, I think I speak
[07:02.340 --> 07:04.940]  clearly enough that you can understand what I'm saying.
[07:04.940 --> 07:10.140]  I feel like I use those two gifts, and if I didn't use those two gifts that I was given,
[07:10.140 --> 07:14.420]  whatever you believe in, that creation gave me these gifts.
[07:14.420 --> 07:17.380]  If I didn't use it, it would be disrespectful to that creation.
[07:17.380 --> 07:19.340]  I feel like I would explode or something.
[07:19.340 --> 07:20.340]  I play the drums.
[07:20.340 --> 07:21.340]  I grow cannabis.
[07:21.340 --> 07:23.620]  I do a few other things with great passion.
[07:23.620 --> 07:27.500]  I feel like if I didn't share that passion with the world, something would go wrong inside
[07:27.500 --> 07:29.900]  of me physically and or mentally.
[07:29.900 --> 07:33.660]  The rubber bands inside that hold me together would all just start popping if I did not
[07:33.660 --> 07:35.580]  do this podcast for you.
[07:35.580 --> 07:39.900]  That's the long way of saying, I do this because I love you, because I love cannabis, and I
[07:39.900 --> 07:44.740]  want you to grow the best cannabis you can grow, so don't ever feel obligated to contribute
[07:44.740 --> 07:47.260]  to my podcast or to pay me anything.
[07:47.260 --> 07:51.020]  If you can say, hey, thank you, or if you can give me a high five or one of those atta
[07:51.020 --> 07:55.780]  boys or a pat on the back or some shit like that, that is free, and it means just as much
[07:55.780 --> 07:58.300]  to me as a Patreon contribution.
[07:58.300 --> 07:59.300]  Don't get me wrong.
[07:59.300 --> 08:00.540]  I love the Patreon support.
[08:00.540 --> 08:01.660]  Don't stop doing it.
[08:01.660 --> 08:03.940]  But if you're not in a position, that is okay.
[08:03.940 --> 08:09.280]  The show is free for a reason, and those folks that do contribute to Patreon, I'm sure they
[08:09.280 --> 08:13.120]  do not mind you listening for free since they're able to help out.
[08:13.120 --> 08:14.760]  We're all in different spots in life.
[08:14.760 --> 08:16.980]  Some of us can do a lot of things financially.
[08:16.980 --> 08:19.020]  Some of us can do a lot of things physically.
[08:19.020 --> 08:21.020]  Some of us can do a lot of things spiritually.
[08:21.020 --> 08:22.960]  We're all blessed in certain ways.
[08:22.960 --> 08:26.700]  Don't feel like you need to share a blessing with me if it would put you out in any way
[08:26.700 --> 08:27.780]  at all.
[08:28.780 --> 08:33.820]  and do your best in your garden is a great way to show me love and respect, and maybe
[08:33.820 --> 08:35.800]  also just tell a friend about the show.
[08:35.800 --> 08:38.140]  That's another great way to pay me back a little bit.
[08:38.140 --> 08:39.440]  Just say, hey, have you heard this show?
[08:39.440 --> 08:40.440]  This guy's fucking cool.
[08:40.440 --> 08:41.440]  He does a cool show.
[08:41.440 --> 08:42.440]  You may learn something.
[08:42.440 --> 08:45.860]  And then if you're the friend listening, do it again, and just keep telling people, and
[08:45.860 --> 08:49.880]  then the show will grow, and then more people can grow better cannabis, and there will be
[08:49.880 --> 08:55.620]  better cannabis for medical patients, recreational patients, for everybody to smoke throughout
[08:55.620 --> 08:57.700]  the country, throughout the world.
[08:57.740 --> 08:59.700]  Then the price of cannabis will go down.
[08:59.700 --> 09:01.380]  We'll all be growing the best bud on the planet.
[09:01.380 --> 09:03.300]  There'll be good weed everywhere.
[09:03.300 --> 09:04.300]  Nobody will be sick.
[09:04.300 --> 09:05.780]  Everybody will be in a good mood.
[09:05.780 --> 09:07.740]  That's the biggest payment that I could ask for.
[09:07.740 --> 09:09.300]  So show respect to the plant.
[09:09.300 --> 09:10.740]  Show respect and love to me.
[09:10.740 --> 09:11.740]  That's all I need.
[09:11.740 --> 09:13.020]  But big thanks to everybody on Patreon.
[09:13.020 --> 09:14.380]  Big thanks to everybody listening.
[09:14.380 --> 09:17.020]  I told you that dab got me rambling.
[09:17.020 --> 09:18.020]  All right.
[09:18.020 --> 09:22.180]  I do have an email here in front of me, but before I read it, I want to read a message
[09:22.180 --> 09:26.740]  from one of my Patreon supporters, somebody who I've developed a friendship with.
[09:26.780 --> 09:27.780]  This guy says,
[09:27.780 --> 09:30.780]  Hey, I'm sorry for the delay in my Patreon renewal.
[09:30.780 --> 09:35.420]  I had to wait for a replacement card, and then I got hit by a car.
[09:35.420 --> 09:38.060]  So I was out of commission for a few days.
[09:38.060 --> 09:41.180]  There's more to this message, but dude, you got hit by a car.
[09:41.180 --> 09:43.380]  Please don't apologize to me for anything.
[09:43.380 --> 09:44.800]  I hope you're okay.
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.940]  If there is anything that myself or the Irie Army or any of the Grow From Your Heart crew
[09:48.940 --> 09:51.420]  can do for you, you let me know, man.
[09:51.420 --> 09:53.060]  Reach out to me.
[09:53.060 --> 09:57.500]  You've got a crushed foot, a bruised knee, a pinched nerve in your neck, some fucked
[09:57.500 --> 09:58.500]  up discs.
[09:58.500 --> 09:59.940]  It sounds like you've got a lot going on.
[09:59.940 --> 10:00.940]  And then it says,
[10:00.940 --> 10:05.900]  My question is what strain will heal my crushed and fractured foot faster and what's good
[10:05.900 --> 10:09.540]  for overall toes to head pain and relief?
[10:09.540 --> 10:13.300]  I don't know what will help heal your crushed and fractured foot.
[10:13.300 --> 10:15.400]  I would say stay off of it.
[10:15.400 --> 10:17.220]  That is probably the best thing for that.
[10:17.220 --> 10:18.420]  Don't put any weight and pressure on it.
[10:18.420 --> 10:19.420]  I'm not the doctor.
[10:19.420 --> 10:21.420]  I'm sure the doc said that plenty of times.
[10:21.420 --> 10:23.180]  If it hurts, don't do it.
[10:23.180 --> 10:26.820]  The part where I can be helpful is where you ask about a strain which would be good for
[10:26.820 --> 10:33.100]  pain from toes to head because you are seeking relief because everything hurts right now.
[10:33.100 --> 10:35.060]  There are a couple of options.
[10:35.060 --> 10:39.340]  You can smoke something that will make your body go numb and you won't hurt for a while.
[10:39.340 --> 10:43.900]  Or you can also smoke something that gets you so high you forget that your body hurts.
[10:43.900 --> 10:46.580]  Those are two great ways that cannabis works.
[10:46.580 --> 10:52.020]  The only downside I have experienced to using cannabis for pain relief in a situation like
[10:52.020 --> 10:56.820]  this is sometimes if you break something or pull something or mess your body up real good
[10:56.820 --> 11:00.740]  in one specific spot where you've got a lot of bruising and a lot of blood flow, when
[11:00.740 --> 11:03.340]  you smoke, it may elevate your heart rate.
[11:03.340 --> 11:08.740]  It may increase your blood flow, which sometimes makes the painful spot throb a little bit
[11:08.740 --> 11:10.080]  extra.
[11:10.080 --> 11:11.940]  That may be strain dependent.
[11:11.940 --> 11:17.460]  That is definitely going to be injury and body and all kinds of different things dependent.
[11:17.460 --> 11:19.900]  There are so many factors here.
[11:19.900 --> 11:25.140]  You may get nice and baked and wherever you hurt, this foot, your discs, your neck, your
[11:25.140 --> 11:29.580]  back, your neck and your back, they may hurt more than they do now.
[11:29.580 --> 11:30.580]  It may get warm.
[11:30.580 --> 11:31.580]  It may get red.
[11:31.580 --> 11:33.100]  It may start throbbing.
[11:33.100 --> 11:37.020]  There is just an increased blood flow to that area.
[11:37.100 --> 11:42.460]  I don't know if that is going to help heal that area or not by having more blood there.
[11:42.460 --> 11:46.060]  You would think maybe by having more blood move around, maybe it would help it heal.
[11:46.060 --> 11:50.020]  Also, you could think by having more blood move around in a bruised area, it could make
[11:50.020 --> 11:51.020]  it worse.
[11:51.020 --> 11:57.540]  Again, I have zero medical professional qualifications, zero, not a doctor.
[11:57.540 --> 12:04.260]  My advice would be to find a really strong sativa dominant strain, smoke that, see how
[12:04.260 --> 12:05.460]  that works for you.
[12:05.460 --> 12:09.580]  Something like a double dragon or a lemon Jeffrey, something in that real high sativa
[12:09.580 --> 12:10.580]  area.
[12:10.580 --> 12:15.340]  Then I would find something more indica dominant, something like the hellfire OG or the liberation
[12:15.340 --> 12:16.340]  OG.
[12:16.340 --> 12:18.940]  Then smoke a fat bowl of that first thing in the morning.
[12:18.940 --> 12:22.540]  Try that as your first smoke of the day and see how that works for you.
[12:22.540 --> 12:26.180]  Make sure that's the first one you've smoked so you start off nice and fresh, your palate's
[12:26.180 --> 12:30.020]  nice and clean, your mind and your body are still clear and sore, and you can see what
[12:30.020 --> 12:33.500]  kind of effect each strain have on your body.
[12:33.500 --> 12:34.940]  Then you've done an indica dominant.
[12:34.940 --> 12:36.500]  You've done a sativa dominant.
[12:36.500 --> 12:41.180]  Let's work our way towards something more hybrid like maybe try some morning dew.
[12:41.180 --> 12:45.380]  Smoke a fat bowl of morning dew first thing the next morning and see what that does for
[12:45.380 --> 12:46.380]  you.
[12:46.380 --> 12:48.280]  One of those is going to make you throb.
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.900]  One of those is going to make you feel better, and one of those you probably won't even notice.
[12:52.900 --> 12:57.120]  Then if none of those provide the relief and comfort you were looking for, that's where
[12:57.120 --> 12:59.200]  we turn to CBD.
[12:59.200 --> 13:00.900]  You may go to CBD first.
[13:00.900 --> 13:02.900]  I'm not sure which route you want to take.
[13:02.900 --> 13:04.940]  I think I know you from our conversations.
[13:04.940 --> 13:10.420]  I'm pretty sure you want to try these THC routes first, but the CBD never hurts to try.
[13:10.420 --> 13:13.940]  When you do get your CBD, make sure it is from a reliable source.
[13:13.940 --> 13:15.980]  I've given that speech enough times.
[13:15.980 --> 13:18.020]  Don't buy your CBD from the gas station.
[13:18.020 --> 13:19.420]  Don't buy some bullshit.
[13:19.420 --> 13:21.780]  Get a quality CBD product.
[13:21.780 --> 13:26.980]  Spend as much time, energy, effort, and money on your CBD as you do your cannabis, and you
[13:26.980 --> 13:28.780]  should have positive results.
[13:28.780 --> 13:30.060]  I guess that's not accurate.
[13:30.060 --> 13:33.380]  Money doesn't always mean quality, but do the work, put in the effort, and you should
[13:33.380 --> 13:35.220]  find a quality product.
[13:35.220 --> 13:40.640]  But again, I would recommend find an indica, find a sativa, and find a hybrid, and smoke
[13:40.640 --> 13:43.500]  on those, and see which one gives you the relief.
[13:43.500 --> 13:45.020]  One may make it throb.
[13:45.020 --> 13:49.460]  If you get a nice sativa, you may get so stoned that you forgot your back even hurts.
[13:49.460 --> 13:51.300]  That is one of the magical wonders of cannabis.
[13:51.300 --> 13:52.840]  It makes you forget stuff.
[13:52.840 --> 13:56.900]  If you get a nice indica, it may make you so relaxed that nothing hurts.
[13:56.900 --> 14:01.140]  Also, both of those have the opportunity to really enhance the pain.
[14:01.140 --> 14:05.500]  You may get so stoned that all you can think about is that fucking leg, and that foot,
[14:05.500 --> 14:07.780]  and your neck, your back, your neck, and your back.
[14:07.780 --> 14:10.140]  That may be the only thing you can focus on.
[14:10.140 --> 14:14.460]  So those are the best recommendations I can make because it is going to be strain specific,
[14:14.460 --> 14:15.460]  body type specific.
[14:15.460 --> 14:19.980]  It is all going to be up to your body and the flowers that you find.
[14:19.980 --> 14:22.700]  And that is one of my favorite parts about cannabis.
[14:22.700 --> 14:25.620]  Also one of the most frustrating parts about cannabis.
[14:25.620 --> 14:29.020]  You already know that cannabis is going to help, but we have to kind of dial it in.
[14:29.020 --> 14:30.020]  Like do you want a sativa?
[14:30.020 --> 14:31.020]  Do you need an indica?
[14:31.020 --> 14:35.260]  Is there a specific terp or a specific cannabinoid that helps with your condition?
[14:35.260 --> 14:37.380]  I love that we can dose ourselves.
[14:37.380 --> 14:42.920]  Since you cannot die from consuming cannabis, you can smoke as much as you need to to find
[14:42.920 --> 14:45.060]  relief and you can find that level.
[14:45.060 --> 14:48.740]  And then it is okay to go a little bit past that level to put yourself in that state where
[14:48.740 --> 14:51.620]  you almost panic and you feel a little bit of discomfort.
[14:51.620 --> 14:54.860]  And then you know that is what happens when I go this far.
[14:54.980 --> 14:58.460]  Maybe I take three puffs off this joint and my neck does not hurt.
[14:58.460 --> 15:01.780]  Maybe I take four puffs off this joint and my neck feels really good.
[15:01.780 --> 15:04.460]  That fifth puff, I start getting a little bit giggly.
[15:04.460 --> 15:07.620]  By number six, oh shit, I need to call a friend for help.
[15:07.620 --> 15:09.760]  You got to learn how to do that and learn how to get there.
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.300]  But once you learn how to dial in that medicine, you really know how to take care of yourself
[15:14.300 --> 15:15.300]  with your medicine.
[15:15.300 --> 15:20.020]  You know exactly how often to hit that bull, how hard to hit it, how many puffs to take.
[15:20.020 --> 15:24.900]  I know about every this often I need about this big of a dab to keep my body and my mind
[15:24.900 --> 15:25.980]  right where I want them.
[15:25.980 --> 15:28.220]  I think it is about an hour, about every hour or so.
[15:28.220 --> 15:32.020]  I want a pretty decent size chunky dab and that is just ideal.
[15:32.020 --> 15:34.420]  If I do not get my dab every hour, I am going to survive.
[15:34.420 --> 15:39.140]  But in an ideal world, if I just could whip out the rig and pull a fat dab, every hour
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.460]  I take a decent dab.
[15:40.460 --> 15:43.980]  I think it has come down to about every three or four hours because of stupid reality and
[15:43.980 --> 15:44.980]  stuff.
[15:44.980 --> 15:47.300]  But we understand how to dose ourselves.
[15:47.300 --> 15:51.220]  You do not have to get a bottle that says every six hours take one of these pills.
[15:51.220 --> 15:53.380]  You go to the dispensary and you get as much as you need.
[15:53.380 --> 15:56.500]  When it is time to take your medicine, you take it if your budget allows.
[15:56.500 --> 15:59.540]  Unfortunately, sorry, some folks are not able to do that.
[15:59.540 --> 16:01.620]  If you are not in a medical state, I guess that is not an option.
[16:01.620 --> 16:02.900]  But that is one of the great things about cannabis.
[16:02.900 --> 16:05.780]  You are not going to die from it and you get to learn your dosage.
[16:05.780 --> 16:06.780]  You can find your...
[16:06.780 --> 16:09.220]  I always say that my first dab is medical.
[16:09.220 --> 16:11.300]  The first dab makes all the back pain go away.
[16:11.300 --> 16:13.300]  It makes my brain unscramble.
[16:13.300 --> 16:17.700]  The second dab, that might be heavily medicating myself.
[16:17.700 --> 16:19.420]  That third dab, that is recreational.
[16:19.420 --> 16:20.820]  We are just having fun with the third one.
[16:20.820 --> 16:23.420]  Now I am just hanging out with Mike, trying to talk some shit, trying to ramble into a
[16:23.420 --> 16:24.420]  microphone.
[16:24.420 --> 16:27.860]  Speaking of rambling, let us get my high ass back on track.
[16:27.860 --> 16:31.540]  Hey, Gramps, Richard Memmel, thank you for the great message, dude.
[16:31.540 --> 16:34.620]  Do not worry about contributing to the podcast while you are down.
[16:34.620 --> 16:35.900]  Take good care of yourself.
[16:35.900 --> 16:37.900]  Take care of your body.
[16:37.900 --> 16:40.420]  Microphones and podcast equipment are replaceable.
[16:40.420 --> 16:43.700]  Your foot, your body, and your life only happen once.
[16:43.700 --> 16:46.860]  Make sure you take the best care of that while you can and enjoy it.
[16:46.860 --> 16:47.860]  Don't stress on me.
[16:47.860 --> 16:49.460]  I will be here when you are better.
[16:49.460 --> 16:53.380]  Keep listening to the show and get some good flowers and just smoke on it, bro.
[16:53.380 --> 16:56.980]  And if the flowers do not get you nice and medicated, maybe it is time to move up to
[16:56.980 --> 16:57.980]  dabs.
[16:57.980 --> 17:01.540]  And if dabs are not available in your area, that is when we start playing with edibles.
[17:01.540 --> 17:05.380]  If you are eating edibles, I think you are an experienced cannabis consumer, but I am
[17:05.380 --> 17:09.500]  going to say this one time, go lightly and then work your way up.
[17:09.580 --> 17:11.820]  You cannot uneat those edibles.
[17:11.820 --> 17:15.340]  Once the milligrams are in you, all you can do is ride that shit out.
[17:15.340 --> 17:18.420]  So start lightly, maybe 10 milligrams.
[17:18.420 --> 17:20.260]  If you are a bigger dude, maybe 20.
[17:20.260 --> 17:21.260]  Munch it down.
[17:21.260 --> 17:22.260]  Wait for some relief.
[17:22.260 --> 17:26.100]  You are either going to feel it or not in about 45 to an hour and 15.
[17:26.100 --> 17:28.160]  Decide from there, do I need more or not?
[17:28.160 --> 17:29.820]  Maybe smoke a bowl at that point.
[17:29.820 --> 17:33.060]  If you smoke a bowl and have that edible in you, they are going to blend in together.
[17:33.060 --> 17:34.460]  They are going to kick each other off.
[17:34.460 --> 17:35.620]  You may get the relief you need.
[17:35.620 --> 17:38.340]  You are just going to have to experiment with what is available.
[17:38.340 --> 17:40.260]  I don't know if you have a dispensary around you.
[17:40.260 --> 17:44.340]  I don't know if you are in a legal or a medical state, but I am sure you are a grown ass man
[17:44.340 --> 17:47.580]  and you can figure out how to get the medicine that you need.
[17:47.580 --> 17:50.980]  Hopefully you have a good friend who has your back while you are on one foot and while your
[17:50.980 --> 17:54.020]  neck, your back, your neck and your back are out of commission.
[17:54.020 --> 17:55.020]  Holy shit, you guys.
[17:55.020 --> 17:56.020]  I am super rambly.
[17:56.020 --> 17:57.760]  I do have another email here in front of me.
[17:57.760 --> 18:01.700]  This one is going to trigger another ramble fest because I do like this one.
[18:01.700 --> 18:03.740]  So let's just jump right into it.
[18:03.740 --> 18:06.660]  This one goes just like this.
[18:06.660 --> 18:10.300]  It says, Hey there Rasta Jeff, Droman80 here.
[18:10.300 --> 18:13.020]  I caught your guest appearance on the DGC.
[18:13.020 --> 18:15.940]  Big shout out to my friends at the Dude Grows Show.
[18:15.940 --> 18:19.300]  This listener found me through the Dude Grows podcast.
[18:19.300 --> 18:22.460]  If you are not listening to the Dude Grows Show, you better give them a follow.
[18:22.460 --> 18:23.740]  They are on YouTube.
[18:23.740 --> 18:30.240]  That show is available on Apple Podcasts and any other qualified reputable podcast service.
[18:30.240 --> 18:34.500]  The Dude Grows Show is hosted by my friend, The Dude.
[18:34.500 --> 18:38.380]  Also hosted and or co-hosted by another good dude called Scotty Real.
[18:38.380 --> 18:41.940]  And then it is kind of technically led by a guy known as Guru.
[18:41.940 --> 18:43.980]  There are a lot of wonderful dudes behind the scenes.
[18:43.980 --> 18:47.540]  I can't even begin to give all of them shout outs, but they're great friends of mine and
[18:47.540 --> 18:52.280]  I have made a lot of friends and earned a lot of followers and fans through there.
[18:52.280 --> 18:54.300]  So big thanks to the DGC.
[18:54.300 --> 18:55.300]  This message goes on.
[18:55.300 --> 18:57.900]  It says, I always heard great things about you.
[18:57.900 --> 19:00.300]  So anyway, I'm here in Trim Jail.
[19:00.300 --> 19:03.660]  Big shout out to all my friends in Trim Jail sitting there at a table with some headphones
[19:03.660 --> 19:06.180]  on or with the Bluetooth speaker just blasting.
[19:06.180 --> 19:07.900]  They got the podcast going.
[19:07.900 --> 19:08.900]  Big shout out, fist bump.
[19:08.900 --> 19:10.580]  Shout out to all my trimmer friends.
[19:10.580 --> 19:13.260]  Thank you for keeping those herbs looking pretty, getting them to the shelf.
[19:13.260 --> 19:14.780]  The growers do a lot of work.
[19:14.780 --> 19:17.380]  We rely on you guys to finish up our product.
[19:17.380 --> 19:18.700]  Big respect to the trimmers.
[19:18.700 --> 19:22.140]  If anybody trolls you or picks on you for being a trimmer, tell them Rasta Jeff said
[19:22.140 --> 19:23.140]  to eat a dick.
[19:23.140 --> 19:24.280]  You're a bad-ass trimmer.
[19:24.280 --> 19:25.780]  We got to respect the trimmers.
[19:25.780 --> 19:27.980]  We would just have big furry buds without you guys.
[19:27.980 --> 19:29.340]  So thank you.
[19:29.340 --> 19:30.340]  Let's see.
[19:30.340 --> 19:31.340]  There's more.
[19:31.340 --> 19:32.340]  I got to keep moving forward.
[19:32.500 --> 19:35.900]  Oh, got your podcast on while I'm here in Trim Jail.
[19:35.900 --> 19:37.980]  And man, you have me hooked.
[19:37.980 --> 19:44.020]  I don't per se have a question about growing, but my question is, what got you into growing?
[19:44.020 --> 19:45.580]  That is a very good question.
[19:45.580 --> 19:49.380]  It goes on to say, what pitfalls did you have upon your grow career?
[19:49.380 --> 19:54.180]  And what did you use as motivation to keep pushing forward when life didn't go as you
[19:54.180 --> 19:55.180]  planned?
[19:55.180 --> 19:59.060]  And then last but not least, I'm going to become a Patreon supporter within the week.
[19:59.060 --> 20:02.140]  And I'm curious what you recommend from your line.
[20:02.140 --> 20:05.980]  Very dense, nighttime potent, has a high calyx to leaf ratio.
[20:05.980 --> 20:06.980]  Height isn't an issue.
[20:06.980 --> 20:12.100]  Much love and respect from my brother from another mother, but we share the same holy
[20:12.100 --> 20:13.100]  flower.
[20:13.100 --> 20:14.100]  Big shout out to my friend Droman80.
[20:14.100 --> 20:17.240]  I know I read that kind of quickly, but there's a lot to cover here.
[20:17.240 --> 20:20.260]  So let's talk about the Patreon.
[20:20.260 --> 20:22.140]  You're going to become a Patreon supporter.
[20:22.140 --> 20:23.140]  Thank you.
[20:23.140 --> 20:24.140]  I appreciate that.
[20:24.140 --> 20:30.820]  You're asking about a strain recommendation for nighttime, very potent, and high calyx
[20:30.820 --> 20:32.260]  to leaf ratio.
[20:32.260 --> 20:34.940]  You were looking for Liberation OG, my friend.
[20:34.940 --> 20:37.900]  That is the strain I would recommend for you from my lineup.
[20:37.900 --> 20:42.420]  Liberation OG should be available at seedsherenow.com.
[20:42.420 --> 20:45.180]  Of course, use coupon code GFYH10.
[20:45.180 --> 20:47.180]  Save yourself a few bucks at seedsherenow.com.
[20:47.180 --> 20:50.260]  All right, enough advertising.
[20:50.260 --> 20:51.420]  That really was in the question.
[20:51.420 --> 20:53.260]  I didn't just plant that in there.
[20:53.380 --> 20:57.140]  Let's get to the main part of this email here.
[20:57.140 --> 21:00.860]  My question is, what got you into growing?
[21:00.860 --> 21:02.460]  That's a really good spot to start.
[21:02.460 --> 21:04.140]  What got me into growing?
[21:04.140 --> 21:08.520]  I have been around cannabis for as long as I can remember.
[21:08.520 --> 21:13.540]  When I was a little kid, I can remember my uncles and my family members just smoking
[21:13.540 --> 21:15.180]  a joint at a family gathering.
[21:15.180 --> 21:19.740]  If there was a party, if there was an event, if I went somewhere with my uncle, rest in
[21:19.740 --> 21:24.780]  peace to my uncle Eric, but he would always be the one that made that face to everybody.
[21:24.780 --> 21:27.860]  When your stoner friends just look across the room and you make the big eyes or you
[21:27.860 --> 21:30.900]  shrug your shoulders and that means, I think it's time to burn one, dude.
[21:30.900 --> 21:31.900]  Do you agree with me?
[21:31.900 --> 21:35.860]  Of course, everybody fucking agrees because when my uncle Eric made that face, everybody
[21:35.860 --> 21:38.340]  knew it was time to go smoke a fucking joint.
[21:38.340 --> 21:43.580]  I've been around ganja or cannabis or weed in some way, shape or form as long as I can
[21:43.580 --> 21:44.820]  remember.
[21:44.820 --> 21:51.540]  I can remember about first grade approximately that on the back patio of our little house,
[21:51.540 --> 21:57.180]  maybe a little apartment, that we had one of those little wooden planter boxes.
[21:57.180 --> 22:01.900]  One of my uncles was teaching somebody who lived at my house how to grow weed in those
[22:01.900 --> 22:04.020]  little planter boxes.
[22:04.020 --> 22:05.660]  I'm pretty sure this was first grade.
[22:05.660 --> 22:09.460]  I had to be about seven years old because I remember the building in which we lived
[22:09.460 --> 22:10.460]  at the time.
[22:10.460 --> 22:11.620]  I could see the backyard very well.
[22:11.620 --> 22:12.620]  I remember the neighbors.
[22:12.620 --> 22:13.620]  I know the time.
[22:13.940 --> 22:16.860]  It was about first grade, so I was about seven years old.
[22:16.860 --> 22:21.140]  My uncle and somebody else were teaching each other how to grow weed in my little back patio
[22:21.140 --> 22:22.140]  there.
[22:22.140 --> 22:26.620]  Later on in the day, somebody was telling somebody what to do.
[22:26.620 --> 22:29.420]  I had to chime in and say, no, you're telling them wrong.
[22:29.420 --> 22:30.980]  I remember what Eric said.
[22:30.980 --> 22:33.820]  Eric said to do it like this.
[22:33.820 --> 22:36.980]  Everybody looked at me like, oh shit, little man's been paying attention.
[22:36.980 --> 22:38.340]  He kind of caught on.
[22:38.340 --> 22:40.060]  He might know what to do.
[22:40.060 --> 22:41.540]  I always loved the smell of weed.
[22:41.540 --> 22:43.220]  I was just a little kid, but I loved it.
[22:43.700 --> 22:46.540]  When everybody hung out and smoked weed, it was always chill.
[22:46.540 --> 22:50.180]  I knew that when people drank, I could see at a young age that when people drank, my
[22:50.180 --> 22:53.060]  family got fucking silly and out of control when they would drink.
[22:53.060 --> 22:55.540]  When they would smoke, they'd all just chill out.
[22:55.540 --> 22:57.020]  It was a much better vibe.
[22:57.020 --> 23:01.220]  As I got older, I started watching everybody else around me smoke.
[23:01.220 --> 23:03.780]  One day, my buddy Chris was like, you want to hit this?
[23:03.780 --> 23:04.780]  I was like, yes.
[23:04.780 --> 23:07.140]  I just acted like I'd been doing it for a million years.
[23:07.140 --> 23:08.940]  I took a hit off of his pipe.
[23:08.940 --> 23:11.420]  That's why everybody does this.
[23:11.460 --> 23:13.420]  It was time for this shit to happen.
[23:13.420 --> 23:17.540]  I'm pretty sure that I'd been getting a contact buzz just being around my uncles, being in
[23:17.540 --> 23:21.500]  their cars, being in their little ... All the stoner dudes have that one room where
[23:21.500 --> 23:22.500]  they smoke.
[23:22.500 --> 23:25.740]  They just let me hang out in the room because I was a cool little kid and they wanted me
[23:25.740 --> 23:26.740]  to be like them.
[23:26.740 --> 23:28.780]  I fucking am now.
[23:28.780 --> 23:29.780]  That's where I learned it.
[23:29.780 --> 23:32.900]  Eventually, one day, my buddy Chris is like, smoke this with me.
[23:32.900 --> 23:35.940]  I smoked and I loved smoking at that point.
[23:35.940 --> 23:38.620]  Shortly after that, I moved to Colorado.
[23:38.620 --> 23:40.660]  I was just a kid, so I had to move to Colorado.
[23:40.900 --> 23:41.900]  My family moved here.
[23:41.900 --> 23:43.940]  They started a new business here.
[23:43.940 --> 23:44.940]  I went to a new school.
[23:44.940 --> 23:47.380]  I had to establish all new friends here.
[23:47.380 --> 23:50.580]  I moved to Colorado in the middle of the winter.
[23:50.580 --> 23:53.620]  It was snowy and miserable.
[23:53.620 --> 23:57.580]  All I got to do was meet my neighbor across the street who took me to school.
[23:57.580 --> 24:01.060]  All I did was go to school every day and then come home and then do my homework and go back
[24:01.060 --> 24:04.100]  to school because it was so cold and shitty when I moved here.
[24:04.100 --> 24:08.580]  I hated it because I did not know how to dress or how to survive in this cold.
[24:08.580 --> 24:11.020]  I also didn't know where to get any weed.
[24:11.020 --> 24:15.460]  My neighbors in my neighborhood definitely were not little smokers or stoners or weed
[24:15.460 --> 24:16.460]  heads.
[24:16.460 --> 24:18.060]  They were definitely more square folks.
[24:18.060 --> 24:20.700]  Eventually, I turned them into stoners.
[24:20.700 --> 24:24.380]  I did not know where to get weed at the time, but I'd been watching the kids at school,
[24:24.380 --> 24:27.940]  paying attention to who might look like they're stoned or might smell like they're stoned
[24:27.940 --> 24:30.260]  or whatever or might smell like they got some weed on them.
[24:30.260 --> 24:31.820]  I started paying attention.
[24:31.820 --> 24:33.660]  Then I joined a band.
[24:33.660 --> 24:35.140]  One day, we went camping.
[24:35.140 --> 24:37.540]  That was when everybody was like, hey, are you cool?
[24:37.540 --> 24:38.540]  I was like, what the fuck?
[24:38.540 --> 24:39.940]  I'm the coolest motherfucker you know.
[24:39.940 --> 24:41.420]  They're like, we thought so.
[24:41.420 --> 24:44.020]  They all busted out their weed and maybe a few other things.
[24:44.020 --> 24:45.980]  I smoked down and I missed it.
[24:45.980 --> 24:47.740]  I missed it so much.
[24:47.740 --> 24:49.820]  I started buying a lot of weed around here.
[24:49.820 --> 24:52.860]  I found the people you could buy the herb from.
[24:52.860 --> 24:58.820]  Unfortunately, they weren't the most reliable, responsible, friendly, honest people.
[24:58.820 --> 25:01.900]  Sometimes your bag would not weigh even fucking close to what it was supposed to weigh, but
[25:01.900 --> 25:03.380]  sometimes it would.
[25:03.380 --> 25:08.300]  Then I started maybe buying ... They wouldn't sell to some people.
[25:08.300 --> 25:11.580]  Some of my friends were afraid to approach some of these people because of their appearance,
[25:11.580 --> 25:13.540]  but I'm from California.
[25:13.540 --> 25:14.620]  Those guys have the good weed.
[25:14.620 --> 25:17.620]  The guys that my friends were afraid of, I know that they got the good weed.
[25:17.620 --> 25:18.620]  I just hit them up.
[25:18.620 --> 25:19.780]  I was like, I know I'm from California, bro.
[25:19.780 --> 25:22.260]  You guys always had the good weed in California.
[25:22.260 --> 25:23.900]  You guys got the good weed out here too?
[25:23.900 --> 25:24.900]  We got the good weed, I say.
[25:24.900 --> 25:27.620]  I was like, I want to buy a lot of it.
[25:27.620 --> 25:28.620]  First they sold me a quarter.
[25:28.620 --> 25:30.700]  Then I bought a lot of quarters.
[25:30.700 --> 25:31.700]  They were like, you need to buy an ounce.
[25:32.020 --> 25:33.500]  I started buying a lot of ounces.
[25:33.500 --> 25:36.540]  All my friends were getting weed from me because they wouldn't mess with those guys.
[25:36.540 --> 25:39.060]  They're like, that's not our crew.
[25:39.060 --> 25:40.660]  I was like, I'm not worried about those guys.
[25:40.660 --> 25:43.460]  I'd go buy the herb from them and then sell it to all the hippies and then go back to
[25:43.460 --> 25:46.900]  them and eventually I was doing larger quantities.
[25:46.900 --> 25:49.740]  By this point, I am deeply immersed in the cannabis game.
[25:49.740 --> 25:53.060]  The statute of limitations has got to be gone for all this because I'm on a good ramble
[25:53.060 --> 25:54.820]  totally incriminating myself here.
[25:54.820 --> 26:00.060]  I just got deeply immersed into the cannabis industry, the cannabis game, the business.
[26:00.100 --> 26:05.340]  Then through my music connections and being in a band, I ended up moving to another state
[26:05.340 --> 26:08.340]  deeper into the Midwest from Colorado.
[26:08.340 --> 26:12.500]  I was a choice that I made to be in this band and it was a really good decision.
[26:12.500 --> 26:18.300]  One day while in this location, I was at a friend's house and my eyes were hit by this
[26:18.300 --> 26:20.140]  really familiar light spectrum.
[26:20.140 --> 26:21.820]  I went, whoa, what is that?
[26:21.820 --> 26:25.100]  I went, oh, he's got a grow light up there.
[26:25.100 --> 26:29.580]  At this point, I had had a little bit of experience helping other people run gardens, but I'd
[26:29.580 --> 26:31.660]  never ran a garden by myself.
[26:31.660 --> 26:35.700]  I'd been around it since I was a kid, so whenever I saw plants, I was just enthusiastic and
[26:35.700 --> 26:38.740]  my friends would always want to show off and show me their grows.
[26:38.740 --> 26:42.420]  I'd been in several grows and been around it and I'd done a few little chores and things,
[26:42.420 --> 26:46.100]  but I'd never really been super hands on.
[26:46.100 --> 26:50.020]  At the end of the evening, I let everybody leave and I politely told my buddy, I go,
[26:50.020 --> 26:54.340]  hey, your metal halide light hit me right in the face when I was doing this part of
[26:54.340 --> 26:55.340]  the day.
[26:55.340 --> 26:56.860]  He goes, oh shit, so you saw my lights?
[26:56.860 --> 26:57.860]  I go, yeah, no worries.
[26:58.340 --> 27:01.220]  He goes, no, dude, if you saw the lights, maybe you can help me.
[27:01.220 --> 27:04.180]  He took me into his grow space and he had a problem.
[27:04.180 --> 27:07.620]  I was quickly able to diagnose that problem.
[27:07.620 --> 27:10.980]  I think it was from being around the plants when I was a little kid with my family.
[27:10.980 --> 27:15.620]  I think I learned how to identify that problem from then and it stuck in my head as a seven
[27:15.620 --> 27:17.420]  and eight year old kid.
[27:17.420 --> 27:20.740]  He corrected my buddy's problem and he's like, hey, I've got to go out of town for a couple
[27:20.740 --> 27:24.260]  of days next week, kind of a surprise mission, didn't know I had to go.
[27:24.260 --> 27:26.100]  I need somebody to take care of these plants.
[27:26.100 --> 27:27.100]  Can you do it?
[27:27.340 --> 27:28.340]  I was like, I got you, bro.
[27:28.340 --> 27:29.340]  He leaves town.
[27:29.340 --> 27:30.620]  I took care of his plants.
[27:30.620 --> 27:32.380]  They came out amazing, stellar.
[27:32.380 --> 27:34.860]  He had to stay gone longer than anticipated.
[27:34.860 --> 27:37.740]  When the dude came back, he was really anxious to get to his plants.
[27:37.740 --> 27:40.780]  This was before we had all this internet stuff where I could just send you a picture with
[27:40.780 --> 27:42.220]  my phone every day.
[27:42.220 --> 27:45.380]  I don't think we would have been comfortable doing that because of our location and because
[27:45.380 --> 27:49.180]  of the timeframe, but he came home and he was amazed.
[27:49.180 --> 27:52.300]  He's like, bro, my plants have never looked this good before.
[27:52.300 --> 27:54.580]  He told me he would give me a little bit of the crop for helping him.
[27:54.580 --> 27:58.340]  He gave me a nice portion of that crop for helping him.
[27:58.340 --> 28:01.260]  Then I showed him how to trim even better because I'd been a trimmer.
[28:01.260 --> 28:02.860]  I think we all start off as trimmers.
[28:02.860 --> 28:04.620]  You start trimming and then you earn the respect.
[28:04.620 --> 28:07.620]  You show that you could do it, but I'd been trimming a lot by then.
[28:07.620 --> 28:10.060]  I showed him how to trim real nicely.
[28:10.060 --> 28:12.300]  I was proud of myself at that point.
[28:12.300 --> 28:16.140]  Then we will fast forward several years because this story is getting long.
[28:16.140 --> 28:20.220]  I found some friends who were trying to open a dispensary in my neighborhood.
[28:20.220 --> 28:22.000]  They had a lot of great ideas.
[28:22.000 --> 28:27.040]  They were older folks, so they were missing a younger, hipper element that could actually
[28:27.040 --> 28:30.880]  hit the street and put the word on the street that there was a dispensary out.
[28:30.880 --> 28:34.200]  Maybe I could put some younger, hipper vibes into the dispensary.
[28:34.200 --> 28:35.600]  I started going to this place.
[28:35.600 --> 28:39.960]  It was just an office where you would go in and you would consult with the weird guy.
[28:39.960 --> 28:42.480]  He would recommend products and you would leave.
[28:42.480 --> 28:46.280]  This man quickly realized that I knew more about cannabis than him.
[28:46.280 --> 28:49.880]  He asked me to transplant plants with him the next day.
[28:49.880 --> 28:54.000]  I didn't realize that that was basically my application for becoming an employee with
[28:54.000 --> 28:55.360]  his dispensary.
[28:55.360 --> 28:58.280]  He hired me to be the first bud tender.
[28:58.280 --> 29:01.200]  Then he hired me to be a helper in the garden.
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.000]  Then I told him one day that we could improve the grow by doing a few things.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.960]  He laughed at me and I said, no, it would work.
[29:07.960 --> 29:11.520]  He threw some plants at me and told me, go home and show me.
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.720]  I went to the store and bought a very small setup and I built a very small grow in my
[29:15.720 --> 29:16.720]  house.
[29:16.840 --> 29:20.960]  Then I grew product that was better than his product and he had been growing for quite
[29:20.960 --> 29:21.960]  a few years.
[29:21.960 --> 29:23.600]  I loved those plants.
[29:23.600 --> 29:25.080]  I loved being around the plants.
[29:25.080 --> 29:27.360]  I loved being near the plants.
[29:27.360 --> 29:31.760]  Then I got to take that product to the dispensary and people would come into the store and they
[29:31.760 --> 29:36.200]  would buy the flowers that I grew and they would take it home and they would smoke it.
[29:36.200 --> 29:40.440]  They would come back two or three, maybe a week later and they would tell me, man, I
[29:40.440 --> 29:44.840]  smoked that stuff that you grew and whatever pain was in my foot or in my back or in my
[29:44.840 --> 29:48.240]  neck or my neck and my back, that pain went away.
[29:48.240 --> 29:52.360]  The first time I met these people, they would look sad and in pain like their life wasn't
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.000]  as good as it could be.
[29:54.000 --> 29:58.040]  Then I grew a product that they smoked it and they felt better.
[29:58.040 --> 29:59.560]  They could put their cane away.
[29:59.560 --> 30:02.000]  I had a friend leave without his cane.
[30:02.000 --> 30:07.560]  He showed up with his cane and we medicated him so heavily that he got up and walked away
[30:07.560 --> 30:08.720]  and had to come back and laugh.
[30:08.720 --> 30:10.360]  I forgot my cane, dude.
[30:10.360 --> 30:12.760]  He didn't realize how profound that was.
[30:12.760 --> 30:14.720]  You left your cane here because of cannabis.
[30:14.800 --> 30:17.760]  You're able to stand up and walk away and giggle.
[30:17.760 --> 30:19.920]  He'd been a grouchy old fucker for several years.
[30:19.920 --> 30:20.920]  He's gone now.
[30:20.920 --> 30:21.920]  Love you, bro.
[30:21.920 --> 30:22.920]  Rest in peace.
[30:22.920 --> 30:26.400]  It's funny as shit that that old man forgot his cane and giggled about it because he was
[30:26.400 --> 30:31.000]  a crotchety old dude and we smoked him into oblivion and he smiled and he forgot that
[30:31.000 --> 30:32.680]  life sucked for him for a few minutes.
[30:32.680 --> 30:34.120]  He was able to enjoy himself.
[30:34.120 --> 30:36.160]  He put away all that bullshit.
[30:36.160 --> 30:37.480]  He forgot about his car wreck.
[30:37.480 --> 30:38.720]  He forgot about his divorce.
[30:38.720 --> 30:42.360]  He forgot about his pain and suffering and he enjoyed life.
[30:42.360 --> 30:47.120]  That happened because of a product that I took some time to nurture and grow.
[30:47.120 --> 30:49.280]  That nurturing of that plant nurtured me.
[30:49.280 --> 30:50.280]  I feel better for it.
[30:50.280 --> 30:51.280]  It's some focus.
[30:51.280 --> 30:52.520]  It slows my brain down.
[30:52.520 --> 30:56.640]  It makes me forget about whatever is hurting me, whatever is paining me.
[30:56.640 --> 31:00.720]  Then I grow that and then I get to smoke it with my friend and I get to watch him feel
[31:00.720 --> 31:01.720]  better.
[31:01.720 --> 31:03.600]  Then imagine how many people I've smoked with.
[31:03.600 --> 31:04.600]  I was a grower.
[31:04.600 --> 31:05.600]  I was a bud tender.
[31:05.600 --> 31:09.920]  I had the only dispensary here in my city for two years.
[31:09.920 --> 31:12.120]  Imagine how many people's lives I got to touch.
[31:12.880 --> 31:17.720]  I got to make their quality of life better by growing a quality product and also by spending
[31:17.720 --> 31:18.720]  a moment with them.
[31:18.720 --> 31:23.440]  As a good bud tender then, you didn't just, here's an eight, I want 50 bucks.
[31:23.440 --> 31:24.840]  It was, how are you?
[31:24.840 --> 31:27.520]  As soon as you walk into my bud room, how are you?
[31:27.520 --> 31:29.080]  Are you okay?
[31:29.080 --> 31:30.800]  I knew my people by first names.
[31:30.800 --> 31:31.960]  I knew about their families.
[31:31.960 --> 31:33.760]  I knew why they were smoking.
[31:33.760 --> 31:35.680]  So I could ask, how's that foot?
[31:35.680 --> 31:37.280]  Is that broken foot feeling any better?
[31:37.280 --> 31:38.800]  Is that sciatica healing up?
[31:38.800 --> 31:40.520]  I remember what I sold you last time.
[31:40.520 --> 31:41.520]  Did it work for you?
[31:41.920 --> 31:43.720]  This was really cool.
[31:43.720 --> 31:45.720]  Back then in the dispensary, we could smoke in there.
[31:45.720 --> 31:47.720]  So I would oftentimes have a bowl or a joint.
[31:47.720 --> 31:49.520]  So I'd say, hey, this is the new shit.
[31:49.520 --> 31:50.520]  Take a puff off of this.
[31:50.520 --> 31:54.920]  And they'd smoke it and you could immediately watch their pain or their anxiety just melt
[31:54.920 --> 31:56.160]  away a little bit.
[31:56.160 --> 31:59.760]  So that was, I'm rambling a lot because I have a lot of passion for this.
[31:59.760 --> 32:04.520]  But I guess that is the bottom line of why I got into this and why I started growing.
[32:04.520 --> 32:08.720]  I was buying product from dispensaries and buying product and it wasn't up to par.
[32:08.720 --> 32:09.720]  I didn't like it.
[32:09.720 --> 32:11.000]  I knew I could do better.
[32:11.000 --> 32:14.880]  And then the owner and grower at this dispensary challenged me.
[32:14.880 --> 32:17.880]  He said, if you think you can do it as good as me, go ahead and do it.
[32:17.880 --> 32:22.760]  I knew that if I took my passion and my education and some books and some time and energy that
[32:22.760 --> 32:24.920]  I could create an amazing product.
[32:24.920 --> 32:25.960]  And I did that.
[32:25.960 --> 32:27.200]  And I have never looked back.
[32:27.200 --> 32:33.120]  I've looked at improving my garden, my grow knowledge, my grow skills every single day.
[32:33.120 --> 32:35.120]  What I'm able to share on here is minimal.
[32:35.120 --> 32:38.860]  I know a lot of stuff, but I just have to be able to put it into a show.
[32:38.860 --> 32:40.560]  So I learn something every day.
[32:41.120 --> 32:42.920]  I don't think that I have ever stopped learning.
[32:42.920 --> 32:44.000]  That's when you burn out.
[32:44.000 --> 32:45.080]  That's when you fail.
[32:45.080 --> 32:47.200]  So that is what got me into growing.
[32:47.200 --> 32:49.960]  I started growing because of the demand for cannabis.
[32:49.960 --> 32:51.040]  I didn't like paying for it.
[32:51.040 --> 32:52.440]  I didn't like the quality.
[32:52.440 --> 32:54.000]  And then I was challenged.
[32:54.000 --> 32:56.000]  Somebody said, you can't do it as good as me.
[32:56.000 --> 32:59.920]  And when you say that to me, I kind of have to show you that yes, I can, especially when
[32:59.920 --> 33:03.560]  it came to anything involved in cannabis, because I was a giant weed nerd.
[33:03.560 --> 33:05.360]  I thought I was a weed expert.
[33:05.360 --> 33:07.920]  And so I had to just grow the best weed ever.
[33:07.920 --> 33:09.040]  And then I saw the results.
[33:09.040 --> 33:12.080]  I saw little old ladies not feel like shit.
[33:12.080 --> 33:16.200]  I saw athletes with broken knees able to do athletic shit again.
[33:16.200 --> 33:18.000]  I saw guys with mental conditions.
[33:18.000 --> 33:22.720]  They can't form a complete sentence, able to calm down and have a conversation and actually
[33:22.720 --> 33:25.760]  achieve a relationship and have friends and girlfriends.
[33:25.760 --> 33:28.600]  So I've seen a lot of great results from cannabis.
[33:28.600 --> 33:29.560]  That's what got me into it.
[33:29.560 --> 33:30.920]  And that is what kept me there.
[33:30.920 --> 33:33.080]  In one word, bro, the answer to that is passion.
[33:33.080 --> 33:35.680]  I'm sorry it took me 20 minutes to get to that point.
[33:35.680 --> 33:37.360]  So now there is more to this question.
[33:37.360 --> 33:42.360]  What pitfalls did you have upon your grow career and what did you use as motivation
[33:42.360 --> 33:47.640]  to keep pushing forward when life didn't go as you planned?
[33:47.640 --> 33:49.600]  Life will never go as planned.
[33:49.600 --> 33:51.800]  It will go kind of the way it should.
[33:51.800 --> 33:56.480]  You can kind of foresee the future and try to hope and prepare for the best, but life
[33:56.480 --> 33:58.240]  will never go as planned.
[33:58.240 --> 34:03.200]  And accepting that and being able to flow with that is one of the biggest challenges
[34:03.200 --> 34:05.040]  and obstacles to overcome.
[34:05.040 --> 34:09.480]  But once you've accepted the fact that you have zero control over this life, you don't
[34:09.480 --> 34:13.440]  have any control over tomorrow, you don't have any control over the other people.
[34:13.440 --> 34:17.500]  All you can really control is what you do and what you put out and how you react and
[34:17.500 --> 34:18.920]  respond to things.
[34:18.920 --> 34:23.400]  Once you accept that and understand that, it is so much easier to just relax and enjoy
[34:23.400 --> 34:24.400]  life.
[34:24.400 --> 34:28.920]  So there have been a lot of pitfalls as a cannabis grower.
[34:28.920 --> 34:32.040]  We've always had to worry about legalities, pitfalls.
[34:32.040 --> 34:37.480]  I have driven up to houses that may allegedly have had nine to 12 lights in that house and
[34:37.480 --> 34:41.160]  possibly somewhere between 75 to 100 plants.
[34:41.160 --> 34:44.680]  And I may have seen a bunch of red and blue lights in front of that house and you just
[34:44.680 --> 34:47.480]  keep going like you don't know that house even existed.
[34:47.480 --> 34:49.440]  You just drive right past it.
[34:49.440 --> 34:50.440]  What did I lose there?
[34:50.440 --> 34:56.760]  Nine to 12 lights, bulbs, ballasts, hoods, fucking nutrients, equipment, measuring equipment,
[34:56.760 --> 35:01.280]  and also however many fucking plants were in the room and that house is gone.
[35:01.520 --> 35:02.520]  It's not in my name.
[35:02.520 --> 35:03.560]  It's in somebody else's name.
[35:03.560 --> 35:05.480]  All the utilities are in the homeowner's name.
[35:05.480 --> 35:08.220]  It's just a rental, but you just keep on driving allegedly.
[35:08.220 --> 35:09.360]  You don't even stop.
[35:09.360 --> 35:10.360]  So that house is gone.
[35:10.360 --> 35:12.720]  That is one of the pitfalls of being a cannabis grower.
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.400]  Also, it messes with relationships because when cannabis was not legal to grow, you had
[35:17.400 --> 35:21.760]  to have alibis and stories of why you've always got to go home every 12 hours and water some
[35:21.760 --> 35:22.760]  fucking plants.
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.480]  You got to have an alibi of why nobody can come to your house because it smells like
[35:26.480 --> 35:29.240]  a giant skunk and diesel fuel factory.
[35:29.240 --> 35:32.360]  You've got to have alibis why nobody can use their restroom because that's where the
[35:32.360 --> 35:36.440]  RO filter and all the water equipment is.
[35:36.440 --> 35:38.600]  Being a grower can mess up relationships.
[35:38.600 --> 35:42.040]  You have to have an alibi of why you can't hang out with anybody for like two weeks because
[35:42.040 --> 35:45.580]  you're trying to trim a crop and you can't have anybody help you because nobody knows
[35:45.580 --> 35:46.580]  about it.
[35:46.580 --> 35:49.280]  You just got to disappear and trim all this shit and get it dried and cured.
[35:49.280 --> 35:51.840]  You can't ignore it because it's wet weed.
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.000]  That stuff messes up your mind, your relationships, your scheduling.
[35:56.000 --> 35:57.760]  It kind of gives you a little bit of paranoia.
[35:57.760 --> 35:59.320]  It'll make you a little bit weird in your head.
[35:59.320 --> 36:01.560]  So that's one of the major pitfalls.
[36:01.560 --> 36:05.120]  Also you've got the risks of getting raided and all that sort of shit in the back of your
[36:05.120 --> 36:06.560]  mind at all times.
[36:06.560 --> 36:07.560]  That's a pitfall.
[36:07.560 --> 36:09.600]  So there are things like that.
[36:09.600 --> 36:10.600]  Then a major pitfall.
[36:10.600 --> 36:13.600]  I talk about that dispensary that I had with a bunch of friends.
[36:13.600 --> 36:15.160]  Mike was my assistant, bud tender.
[36:15.160 --> 36:18.600]  I was basically the manager and fucking I ran that shit.
[36:18.600 --> 36:21.440]  And then one day the city came in and they said, hey, guess what?
[36:21.440 --> 36:23.000]  You can't do this anymore.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.560]  We had established a very functional business with standard operating procedures and flows
[36:28.560 --> 36:29.560]  and employees.
[36:29.560 --> 36:30.840]  And we had a lot of things happening.
[36:30.840 --> 36:33.560]  The community was relying on us to supply medicine.
[36:33.560 --> 36:36.200]  I was relying on that place for a paycheck.
[36:36.200 --> 36:37.880]  We were doing a lot of things together.
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.240]  And then suddenly one day it was gone.
[36:40.240 --> 36:42.180]  So that was a major pitfall.
[36:42.180 --> 36:44.400]  Everybody had to reestablish themselves.
[36:44.400 --> 36:49.440]  After being the major force of one dispensary, no other dispensary would hire me because
[36:49.440 --> 36:51.200]  I was already attached to one place.
[36:51.200 --> 36:52.640]  I had a reputation.
[36:53.280 --> 36:56.080]  They all thought I was coming to sabotage them or do something wrong when honestly I
[36:56.080 --> 36:57.800]  just needed employment.
[36:57.800 --> 37:01.800]  So I had to reestablish and re-figure out my life and figure out my position.
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.920]  And I have no complaints or no problems with that because I really think that that helped
[37:05.920 --> 37:06.920]  me grow.
[37:06.920 --> 37:07.920]  It helped me move on.
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.200]  I think being stuck at that one dispensary, being in that one position, I would have been
[37:11.200 --> 37:12.960]  in that one position forever.
[37:12.960 --> 37:16.760]  I would have just ran that place and I would still be there doing the same old thing.
[37:16.760 --> 37:18.820]  I think that change encourages growth.
[37:18.820 --> 37:22.040]  So I'm glad that that happened in a way, but that was a major pitfall.
[37:22.040 --> 37:23.720]  I didn't have my place of employment.
[37:23.720 --> 37:25.560]  I didn't have my place for community.
[37:25.560 --> 37:28.520]  That wasn't only where I sold cannabis, where I worked.
[37:28.520 --> 37:29.720]  That was where I saw people.
[37:29.720 --> 37:32.840]  I got to see the medical marijuana community.
[37:32.840 --> 37:37.480]  We had such a nice community here that a member of our medical marijuana community got in
[37:37.480 --> 37:40.840]  big trouble and had to go to court and to show support.
[37:40.840 --> 37:46.420]  We had about 30 to 50 members of our medical marijuana community show up at his court case
[37:46.420 --> 37:49.880]  every single day to go show support for this man.
[37:49.880 --> 37:55.160]  They were all people that came to our dispensary that had all developed a relationship as friends.
[37:55.160 --> 37:56.960]  So that was what we were doing for the community.
[37:56.960 --> 37:57.960]  I missed that.
[37:57.960 --> 37:58.960]  That was gone.
[37:58.960 --> 38:00.440]  I had to reinvent that around here.
[38:00.440 --> 38:01.440]  We had to reestablish.
[38:01.440 --> 38:05.740]  So we have had a lot of great pitfalls in the cannabis industry.
[38:05.740 --> 38:08.600]  So those are a couple of great examples of pitfalls.
[38:08.600 --> 38:10.320]  I have had timers fail.
[38:10.320 --> 38:12.200]  I have had equipment fail.
[38:12.200 --> 38:13.720]  That always happens.
[38:13.720 --> 38:15.040]  Then here's my favorite part.
[38:15.040 --> 38:21.160]  It says, what do you use as motivation to keep pushing forward when life didn't go as planned?
[38:22.160 --> 38:28.880]  Sometimes it wasn't always easy to be as positive and to stay motivated as it has become.
[38:28.880 --> 38:30.160]  But now I'm a grown man.
[38:30.160 --> 38:31.160]  I'm 40 years old.
[38:31.160 --> 38:36.640]  I've got 40 years worth of experience to look back and say, hey, shit's been worse than this.
[38:36.640 --> 38:38.120]  You've had worse struggles than this.
[38:38.120 --> 38:39.960]  You've had bigger problems than this.
[38:39.960 --> 38:44.800]  And if you haven't, you at least have more skills and tools to understand how to deal
[38:45.560 --> 38:46.560]  with the shit that's coming at you.
[38:46.560 --> 38:50.240]  So I just think that I try to stay positive by knowing I've been through this.
[38:50.240 --> 38:53.280]  And if I haven't been through this, when I get through the other side of whatever the
[38:53.280 --> 38:56.520]  struggle is, I'm going to have a lot more skills.
[38:56.520 --> 38:59.600]  I'm going to know how to solve that problem for next time.
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.760]  I just think that basically what doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
[39:03.760 --> 39:06.600]  And if you don't keep learning every day, what are you doing?
[39:06.600 --> 39:10.560]  And if you don't keep moving every day, all you're going to do is collect dust and nobody
[39:10.560 --> 39:12.820]  needs to sit there and get dusty.
[39:12.840 --> 39:15.800]  So I just use every day as motivation.
[39:15.800 --> 39:17.860]  Every mistake is motivation.
[39:17.860 --> 39:22.020]  I have killed so many plants, some on purpose, some on accident.
[39:22.020 --> 39:27.100]  But every plant that I killed, I made sure to learn why I killed it, how I killed it,
[39:27.100 --> 39:29.540]  and how not to do that dumb shit again.
[39:29.540 --> 39:34.700]  So I think every mistake, every pitfall, instead of using it as, oh, I made a mistake, I use
[39:34.700 --> 39:37.180]  it as a, whoops, probably shouldn't do that again.
[39:37.180 --> 39:39.220]  And I try to laugh at a mistake.
[39:39.220 --> 39:40.980]  Sometimes that can be frustrating to some people.
[39:40.980 --> 39:42.420]  You just laughed at a major mistake.
[39:43.020 --> 39:44.020]  What do you want me to do?
[39:44.020 --> 39:45.500]  Flip the table over and kick some shit?
[39:45.500 --> 39:49.220]  Or would you rather me laugh and go, look how bad I fucked that up?
[39:49.220 --> 39:55.420]  We've got a really serious opportunity in life every day to laugh, to smile, to love,
[39:55.420 --> 39:56.940]  or you can kick some shit.
[39:56.940 --> 39:57.940]  You can be angry.
[39:57.940 --> 39:59.340]  You can be mad at some shit.
[39:59.340 --> 40:00.580]  It's all a decision.
[40:00.580 --> 40:02.020]  Just choose the right one.
[40:02.020 --> 40:03.340]  And we all know what to choose.
[40:03.340 --> 40:05.660]  And if you're on a bad channel, change the channel.
[40:05.660 --> 40:09.620]  So at this point in life, what motivates me and what keeps me going when life doesn't
[40:09.620 --> 40:14.300]  go my way is knowing that life is never going to go your way.
[40:14.300 --> 40:16.740]  There are millions of people on this planet.
[40:16.740 --> 40:18.340]  I didn't Google to find out how many.
[40:18.340 --> 40:20.860]  There are so fucking many people on this planet.
[40:20.860 --> 40:23.900]  And how can we expect it to go all of their way?
[40:23.900 --> 40:25.920]  None of us want the same shit.
[40:25.920 --> 40:26.920]  Maybe a little bit.
[40:26.920 --> 40:27.920]  We all want peace.
[40:27.920 --> 40:28.920]  We all want to get laid.
[40:28.920 --> 40:31.220]  We all want to eat some food, but maybe we all want to get laid by the same person.
[40:31.220 --> 40:32.740]  And that just creates a problem right there.
[40:32.740 --> 40:35.360]  So how can we all get our own way?
[40:35.360 --> 40:39.240]  How can we be so selfish to expect that the world is going to go our way?
[40:39.860 --> 40:41.760]  We can set ourselves up for success in small ways.
[40:41.760 --> 40:44.320]  We can make our bubble function the way we need it to.
[40:44.320 --> 40:50.160]  But just realizing and believing that I can't control anything but me, and sometimes I don't
[40:50.160 --> 40:55.720]  even have full control over that, that makes it so easy to just get over dumb shit and
[40:55.720 --> 40:57.640]  realize that most of it is dumb shit.
[40:57.640 --> 40:59.880]  Yes, I have had some struggles this year.
[40:59.880 --> 41:05.960]  I lost an uncle who was very close to me, but I am still here and I can't just let that
[41:05.960 --> 41:06.960]  kill me as well.
[41:06.960 --> 41:08.000]  I've got to push on.
[41:08.000 --> 41:09.680]  I've got to make him proud.
[41:09.680 --> 41:11.160]  I've got to make myself proud.
[41:11.160 --> 41:12.280]  I've got a lot of stuff to do.
[41:12.280 --> 41:13.760]  Trust me, I miss my uncle and I love him.
[41:13.760 --> 41:14.760]  I wish he was still here.
[41:14.760 --> 41:17.800]  I wish we could fucking smoke a joint and go see a concert together.
[41:17.800 --> 41:18.800]  But what can I do?
[41:18.800 --> 41:19.840]  I've just got to live on.
[41:19.840 --> 41:21.480]  I've got to be stronger from that.
[41:21.480 --> 41:22.480]  And now guess what?
[41:22.480 --> 41:25.840]  When, if anybody else in my life passes, I'm a little bit stronger and I've got a little
[41:25.840 --> 41:28.800]  bit more skill to deal with losing somebody that I love.
[41:28.800 --> 41:32.320]  So just keep learning, get stronger every single fucking day.
[41:32.320 --> 41:33.320]  That's all we can do.
[41:33.320 --> 41:36.860]  You guys, this became a really long, rambly podcast.
[41:36.860 --> 41:41.580]  There was very little cannabis conversation in here, but this was one of my favorite episodes
[41:41.580 --> 41:43.380]  that I've gotten to do in a long time.
[41:43.380 --> 41:47.340]  I pressed record and I talked for 40 minutes without interruption.
[41:47.340 --> 41:48.340]  Thank you for hanging out.
[41:48.340 --> 41:49.660]  This was therapeutic to me.

[41:51.740 --> 41:53.180]  I appreciate you for listening.
[41:53.180 --> 41:54.820]  I'm going to start wrapping up the show.
[41:54.820 --> 41:57.540]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy Droman80.
[41:57.540 --> 42:01.740]  I hope I answered your question because I got super rambly on this podcast.

[43:20.300 --> 43:23.820]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[44:05.780 --> 44:06.780]  I think my heat is broke.
[44:06.780 --> 44:09.420]  The only thing that keeps me warm is the weed I smoke.
[44:09.420 --> 44:11.940]  Oh wait, pardon me, cause I ain't smoking trees.
[44:11.940 --> 44:14.740]  I'm taking nabs till I choke and heave over heating.
[44:14.740 --> 44:17.300]  Nicely medicated, highly educated.
[44:17.300 --> 44:20.020]  I sell Tynells just to get you faded.
[44:20.020 --> 44:22.380]  Yeah, demonstrated in the oil dome.
[44:22.380 --> 44:25.020]  Sitting in my chair elevated in my royal throne.
[44:25.020 --> 44:27.660]  Another vapor cloud, fading in and out.
[44:27.660 --> 44:30.300]  Contemplated health cause I ate it in and out.
[44:30.300 --> 44:32.660]  I sit about and my nose bleeds state.
[44:32.660 --> 44:35.220]  Then stay up late because I don't sleep great.
[44:35.220 --> 44:37.140]  Like a quarter in a jukebox.
[44:37.140 --> 44:39.460]  My bad, this sort of things I do not.
[44:39.460 --> 44:42.380]  But nine dabs has me orbiting like moon rocks.
[44:42.380 --> 44:44.660]  Linus at the bar ordering a goo shot.
[44:44.660 --> 44:47.420]  Talking to some breasts that are torturing the tube top.
[44:47.420 --> 44:49.740]  Come on Linus, we're fighting a strong bias.
[44:49.740 --> 44:52.660]  Nobody in this town, not even my mom, likes us.
[44:52.660 --> 44:54.940]  They're boycotting, I feel like we're Don Iamus.
[44:54.940 --> 44:57.940]  When ringtone rappers deserve to be on silence.
[44:57.940 --> 45:00.020]  Nah, but I don't give a fuck though.
[45:00.020 --> 45:02.620]  I'm a sitting puffed roe and I spit a rough flow.
[45:02.620 --> 45:04.340]  And you can't get enough though.
[45:04.340 --> 45:05.780]  So there's your Twitter tag.
[45:05.780 --> 45:08.780]  36 bodied up, calling in the bag.
