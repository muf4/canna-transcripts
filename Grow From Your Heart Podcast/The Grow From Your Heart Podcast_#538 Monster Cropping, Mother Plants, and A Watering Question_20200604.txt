[00:00.000 --> 00:06.360]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 538 of the grow from your heart podcast
[00:06.680 --> 00:10.520]  This episode of the show was brought to you by our friends at seeds here now calm
[00:10.840 --> 00:17.900]  Seeds here now calm offers seeds from all of the industry's favorite breeders including miss Jill genetics Duke diamond and of course

[00:43.060 --> 00:47.980]  Calm, you know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today
[00:48.100 --> 00:54.460]  I've been taking dabs of lush cherry full spectrum extract from green dot labs on the package
[00:54.460 --> 01:01.700]  It says this is a blend of copper Kim and cherry kush mints. The flavor is described as leather cherry and gas
[01:01.700 --> 01:03.700]  I think that is spot-on
[01:03.860 --> 01:06.340]  When I crack it open it smells like a cherry
[01:06.580 --> 01:10.380]  Luden's cough drop plus a little bit of gas then when I hit it
[01:10.380 --> 01:16.060]  That's when the leather kicks in when the flavor settles on the tongue you get the cherry then a little bit later
[01:16.060 --> 01:19.460]  That's when the gas kicks in I'm gonna show it to the camera
[01:19.460 --> 01:23.720]  Don't forget the show is now available on YouTube. Try not to spill that big jar there
[01:23.720 --> 01:28.480]  It's a four gram jar filled with chunky diamonds and lots of sauce. I really got close to dumping that
[01:29.980 --> 01:33.900]  But make sure you check out the show on YouTube go to the YouTube channel and please subscribe

[03:13.060 --> 03:18.220]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I think that covers all of the business. I did a quick mic check. It does appear that everything is working
[03:19.060 --> 03:24.500]  Appropriately, let's jump right into the email portion of this episode
[03:24.500 --> 03:29.140]  I've got an email right here in my hand if you've got a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question
[03:29.140 --> 03:33.460]  I would love to hear from you. My email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[03:34.380 --> 03:38.060]  We're gonna turn up these headphones just a touch and keep on recording and not even edit this
[03:40.780 --> 03:42.780]  Oh, I heard the boost and it feels better
[03:43.620 --> 03:51.540]  All right, the first email in today's episode goes just like this. Hey Rasta Jeff. Thank you for years of archived podcasts
[03:51.540 --> 03:53.540]  Hey, thank you for noticing that there are
[03:54.460 --> 04:00.820]  530 something episodes up and I've been doing it for years. Thank you for noticing that they're all archived on that YouTube channel and in
[04:00.820 --> 04:03.380]  The Apple podcast feed so make sure you check them out
[04:03.540 --> 04:09.460]  It goes on to say I've been growing for almost a year now and your grow talks are a complete must and you throw off
[04:09.460 --> 04:15.020]  Nuggets of wisdom on almost every show. Thank you some shows. I know that I do get a little rambly
[04:15.020 --> 04:21.020]  I get a little stony. I get a little spacey, but I do try to have at least one golden nugget in every episode though
[04:21.020 --> 04:22.620]  So thank you for noticing that part
[04:22.620 --> 04:27.580]  It goes on to say I cannot keep mother plants because of plant count limits
[04:27.940 --> 04:31.860]  Also because of time and the expense and space of keeping extra plants
[04:31.860 --> 04:39.340]  I totally understand that struggle part of my account is dedicated to keeping mothers. It goes on to say thank you for your cloning episode
[04:39.340 --> 04:43.220]  I have an almost 100% success rate with cloning
[04:44.820 --> 04:49.940]  You are very very welcome for the cloning episode and I'm excited to hear that you're having 100% success
[04:50.700 --> 04:56.100]  There's more to go it says I'm doing a perpetual grow now. I have three tents of varying sizes
[04:56.100 --> 05:00.500]  I like where this is going. We've got two tents for a flower and a smaller tent for veg
[05:00.500 --> 05:05.660]  I want to put veg plants into my flowering tents the day after harvest
[05:05.660 --> 05:10.900]  I like that that keeps everything right on schedule you cut down you clean up you move more plants in never miss a day
[05:11.020 --> 05:15.280]  Keep the medicine going it says when I cut clones prior to flip
[05:16.000 --> 05:20.320]  They veg for too long and they start to get too big for my space
[05:20.640 --> 05:23.440]  So if I cloned two to three weeks and a flower
[05:23.440 --> 05:23.960]  however
[05:23.960 --> 05:31.740]  The plants would be the perfect size for transfer into their flowering tents and it will allow me to keep three separate lines of genetics
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.080]  Without keeping mothers so that does make great sense
[05:35.080 --> 05:40.720]  There are a few caveats to that this listener who has chimed in a few times big shout out to our friend st
[05:40.720 --> 05:41.640]  Stephen by the way
[05:41.640 --> 05:48.240]  This listener has a very good idea for a perpetual grow and they're trying to utilize their space and it does make sense
[05:48.560 --> 05:54.680]  That when they take clones, they've got to wait nine full weeks of flower or however many weeks they're flowering plus veg
[05:54.680 --> 05:58.560]  They've got to wait a long time until those plants are ready to move into their next space
[06:00.200 --> 06:03.000]  So the plants are growing they're getting a little bit bigger than desired
[06:03.440 --> 06:07.000]  They're outgrowing their space. This guy has found out this listener st
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.480]  Stephen has found out that if they were to cut the clones about 14 to 21 days later
[06:12.480 --> 06:16.040]  They would be the perfect size. But the problem is now the plants are in flower
[06:17.400 --> 06:21.440]  They're doing this. It sounds like they're doing it. Let's see what it goes on to say that they're doing that
[06:21.440 --> 06:24.640]  I'm not experiencing enough to sift through the bullshit on grow forums
[06:24.640 --> 06:31.780]  And then they send me a link where cloning from flower is discussed. The poster is very enthusiastic about the strategy your grow lessons
[06:31.780 --> 06:35.640]  It sounds like you would rather not clone and flower. Do you have any thoughts the pros and cons?
[06:35.880 --> 06:37.880]  That is a great way for me to jump into this
[06:38.360 --> 06:42.560]  This is going to work for you. This is a method that is known as monster cropping
[06:43.360 --> 06:45.360]  my concern is
[06:45.480 --> 06:51.320]  I don't know how long your genetics are going to last before something starts to go wrong
[06:51.560 --> 06:58.320]  We have gone over the phenomenon known. What was the phenomenon known as before? I program my brain genetic drift
[06:58.320 --> 07:01.240]  We don't talk about genetic drift anymore. We have identified that as
[07:02.160 --> 07:03.960]  regenerative mutation
[07:03.960 --> 07:05.600]  but over time
[07:05.600 --> 07:12.120]  What may happen is senescence may trigger beat in that plant that plant you are reproducing the same plant
[07:12.120 --> 07:15.760]  I don't know if senescence is going to kick in eventually in your clone stock
[07:15.760 --> 07:20.480]  I don't know if since you're taking them from flowering plants. The hormones have changed. I
[07:21.360 --> 07:26.720]  Am much more comfortable taking clones from non flowering plants because we've got vegetative hormones you were
[07:27.720 --> 07:31.440]  Flowering a plant cloning it kind of reverting it to veg
[07:31.960 --> 07:37.160]  Flowering it again then taking a clone from that then treating that clone to the same torture
[07:37.160 --> 07:43.200]  I see that over time this may cause a problem. However, I don't have any science to back that up
[07:43.200 --> 07:46.520]  That is just my that's me going. Ooh, that sounds kind of weird
[07:46.520 --> 07:51.000]  Like I don't know it just feels like you may lose something some vigor
[07:51.440 --> 07:54.720]  Something some resistance something may go wrong after that many
[07:55.240 --> 07:58.680]  First of all that many clonings you've got the opportunity again. We don't talk about
[07:59.200 --> 08:02.320]  The regenerative mutation isn't gonna happen. We're cloning well, right?
[08:02.320 --> 08:06.880]  But if we do clone in a bad environment if we make mistakes if we get a disease if we get a pest
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.320]  That's when things can all start going downhill. That'll pass on in the cuts
[08:10.880 --> 08:16.080]  It's gonna work for you, but I wonder how long so I encourage you to do your experiment
[08:16.080 --> 08:22.680]  But don't fall too in love with these cultivars because they may over time decide to just do something weird on you
[08:22.760 --> 08:26.400]  So when you start seeing the vigor slow down when you start seeing something
[08:26.800 --> 08:33.400]  different happen and you're doing the same thing that may be a sign that these plants have just done the clone process and then
[08:33.720 --> 08:35.240]  they have to
[08:35.240 --> 08:39.600]  Reve edge and then flower again and then get that that's a lot of work for a plant
[08:39.600 --> 08:43.640]  That's a lot of stress for a plant. That's only supposed to be an annual. That is a lot of stress
[08:43.640 --> 08:49.360]  So I think your system will work. And again, my only concern is for how long I don't know
[08:49.360 --> 08:52.760]  What is in the DNA that may tell the plant? Hey, we've been doing this for too long
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.240]  Let's just fucking give up and I keep mother plants around for a really long time
[08:57.240 --> 09:01.800]  But again, I'm not flowering them and then trying to revert them and then flower them again and then clone them
[09:01.840 --> 09:07.720]  There's a couple of steps of stress that I'm skipping so it will work. And again, I don't know how long
[09:08.080 --> 09:11.440]  Thank you for listening, dude. I want to know you sent me this a little while back
[09:11.440 --> 09:14.160]  I want to know how things are going. Keep me updated
[09:14.160 --> 09:17.800]  Please let me know how the plants look if the mother plants or the clones have
[09:17.880 --> 09:22.820]  Changed anything if they're starting to act differently from so much stress and so many hormonal changes
[09:22.820 --> 09:26.080]  They may start to get weird on you. All right, I feel like I've said the same thing over and over
[09:26.080 --> 09:31.280]  I've got the microphone adjusted the earphones sound good. Now you guys thanks for listening to a subpar intro
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.200]  I apologize that did not sound up to my standards
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.480]  But we're gonna keep moving because we got the video going trying to kick some ass today
[09:37.360 --> 09:40.960]  Hey st. Stephen, thank you for the great message. Thank you for all of the support
[09:40.960 --> 09:45.200]  You've been around for a long time and I do look forward to an update in the very near future
[09:45.520 --> 09:46.160]  All right
[09:46.160 --> 09:51.020]  Let's keep the show moving this message came from a listener who supports the show on
[09:51.200 --> 09:53.520]  Patreon if you're not supporting the show once again
[09:53.520 --> 09:59.640]  Make sure you do that at patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart or follow the link in the video description or in the show
[09:59.640 --> 10:04.680]  Notes, the message comes from easy. Oh five seven. What's up easy? Oh five seven
[10:04.680 --> 10:08.040]  I know what that oh five seven means, bro. I had a pager in the 90s also
[10:08.600 --> 10:11.640]  But it goes a lot like this. It says when you decide to keep a mother plant
[10:11.640 --> 10:16.760]  Do you ever top pop crack twist or just let it grow naturally in your experience?
[10:16.760 --> 10:20.440]  How long does it take a plant like lemon jeffery to go? Okay. That's a separate question
[10:20.840 --> 10:25.240]  Um, do I pop twist top and manipulate my mother plants?
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.200]  I definitely top them because I want to take out that main apical top so I can get several
[10:30.440 --> 10:34.600]  Uh tops so that when I go to clone i've got a bunch of tops competing to be that main top
[10:34.680 --> 10:37.640]  I clone from the top of the plant many people will tell you clone the bottom
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.520]  I clone from the top. I like those big main fat healthy tops. I don't need a lot of clones
[10:42.760 --> 10:49.080]  Uh, we're very limited by our numbers here even in a commercial environment. I clone from the tops. It makes healthier plants
[10:49.080 --> 10:53.000]  So I do top that main middle. So if you've got a bushy plant that's coming up
[10:53.000 --> 10:55.240]  You got one coming right out of the top. I take that out
[10:55.240 --> 10:59.480]  Now you got a couple of branches that meet the top they're going to compete and become the new apical tops
[10:59.720 --> 11:05.000]  The next time I need clones, guess what? I've got two I cut those off the four branches below those they grow right up
[11:05.000 --> 11:10.440]  Now i've got four clones next time. So I do top my mother plants. I don't do much. Uh,
[11:10.840 --> 11:17.160]  Popping cracking or twisting. I don't need big robust. Uh, these aren't really high performance plants
[11:17.160 --> 11:23.000]  These are these are donor plants that are there to give me clones. They just get fed a very balanced vegetative diet
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.840]  They get a lot of light. I try to give them a lot of light to keep them short and squat
[11:27.080 --> 11:30.120]  They get a lot of topping they get a lot of trimming they get a lot of pruning
[11:30.600 --> 11:32.600]  but not a lot of excess like
[11:33.240 --> 11:38.920]  The popping cracking and twisting is for a couple of things that's to make bigger stronger stocks
[11:38.920 --> 11:43.960]  I want bigger fatter plants when i'm doing that. I don't really need that from the veg plants. They're not going to make buds
[11:44.120 --> 11:47.480]  They're just making me clones. I don't need them recovering all the time. I need them growing
[11:48.120 --> 11:54.920]  The cracking and twisting also is to slow down vertical growth in flower and these guys aren't being triggered to flower
[11:54.920 --> 11:59.400]  So they're not going to get that 21 day stretch. So i'm not concerned with that. So no i'm not doing that kind of shit
[12:00.120 --> 12:02.040]  Now the next part is in your experience
[12:02.040 --> 12:08.600]  How long does it take a plant like lemon jeffrey to go from 20 to 30 percent perfect trichome to overripe?
[12:09.160 --> 12:15.160]  Could I go could I go into that 48 to 72 hour darkness right when I get 20 to 30 percent and then harvest?
[12:15.560 --> 12:18.760]  Uh, thanks for everything you do and for the information high five
[12:18.920 --> 12:23.640]  I love the new instagram live feeds and the youtube videos. Hey easy. Oh five seven
[12:23.640 --> 12:30.040]  Thank you for watching the instagram live videos if you guys are not already watching every monday around 7 10 p.m
[12:30.120 --> 12:35.160]  Mountain time I go on instagram live and I do something similar to this, but I don't have any notes. I'm not prepared
[12:35.240 --> 12:39.560]  I let you guys ask me the questions in the live feed. I do my best to answer your questions there
[12:39.800 --> 12:44.360]  I take a bunch of dabs. I get silly. I talk some shit. It's a good time. Join me on instagram
[12:44.600 --> 12:49.560]  It's iry underscore genetics. Check us out. I think you'll like what we're doing there and you're very welcome, dude
[12:49.560 --> 12:55.880]  I'm glad you're enjoying the instagram videos and the new youtube videos. If you're not watching the video, please go watch the video on youtube
[12:55.880 --> 12:57.400]  I think you will enjoy
[12:57.400 --> 13:02.840]  Now, let's get to the question. How long could it take for those trichomes to go from 20 to 30 percent?
[13:02.840 --> 13:04.840]  Which you find perfect to overripe
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.200]  That is going to depend on your environment and your conditions a little colder environment
[13:10.280 --> 13:14.040]  It will take longer for things to happen warmer environment. It's going to go more quickly
[13:14.600 --> 13:20.280]  Um hotter environment it will happen, uh more rapidly more light it will happen sooner more dark
[13:20.360 --> 13:24.460]  It may take a little bit longer. It's going to depend on your environment and your genetics
[13:24.920 --> 13:30.680]  You've that window is somewhere between three five and seven days is when you're going to see major changes when you go
[13:30.920 --> 13:34.440]  Hey, it's really good to we should cut it to ah shit. I think I got too far
[13:34.920 --> 13:40.200]  So if it's ready, you're asking if you can throw it into that 48 to 72 hour darkness
[13:40.840 --> 13:43.320]  I would say go 24 to 48. I'm not
[13:44.760 --> 13:50.360]  I'm gonna edit that. Holy shit. No, I won't we'll keep going. I would say, uh, instead of 48 to 72
[13:50.600 --> 13:56.040]  Go 24 to 48 hours of darkness. I'm not sure what your goal is with the dark period some plants love it
[13:56.040 --> 13:58.600]  Some do not some get a little more density
[13:58.920 --> 14:01.320]  I'm, not sure what your approach is
[14:01.720 --> 14:06.920]  But uh, just reduce that just go to 48 if you think it's overripe if you were waiting for a message
[14:07.160 --> 14:10.120]  Uh, how long ago did you send this? I don't have a date on this patreon message
[14:10.440 --> 14:13.560]  But hopefully you've harvested this plant by now, but I would say
[14:14.040 --> 14:20.840]  Uh the time where it could go from perfectly ripe to oh that's getting close. That's about a I don't know like your seat
[14:20.840 --> 14:22.680]  You'll see you go. Oh, it's gonna be ripe tomorrow
[14:22.680 --> 14:28.040]  Then that day you probably got three days before you start seeing a major difference five days. You're gonna go. Oh shit
[14:28.040 --> 14:33.720]  We got 45 to 50 percent, uh milky and amber trichomes then like seven to ten days. That's when you're gonna go
[14:33.720 --> 14:36.040]  Oh, man, I really should have cut that down like a week ago
[14:36.280 --> 14:41.560]  So the time frames closer to three day little increments instead of like oh shit yesterday would have been the day
[14:42.280 --> 14:44.680]  It's not really that that tight of a time frame
[14:44.760 --> 14:46.920]  So i'm going to say a three to five day window
[14:47.000 --> 14:52.200]  Uh when you're going to watch things really make a change seven to ten days is when you're really going to see drastic changes
[14:52.280 --> 14:54.120]  and have regrets
[14:54.120 --> 14:55.000]  uh
[14:55.000 --> 14:58.280]  Think about why you're doing the 48 to 72 hour darkness window
[14:58.600 --> 15:01.720]  Uh, there are a lot of reasons why people think they're doing that see if that's right for you
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.280]  See if it's right for your environment and right for your plant
[15:04.680 --> 15:10.920]  Maybe defoliate before you do that because you do give the option for problems with all that foliage and that moisture there
[15:11.240 --> 15:12.760]  in the room
[15:12.760 --> 15:18.680]  All right that came from our friend easy057. I hope I helped you out. I hope you had a very successful harvest
[15:18.840 --> 15:21.880]  Uh, you said how long does it take a plant like lemon jeffrey?
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.480]  So i'm going to hope that was hypothetical and that I did not take too long to answer your question
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.360]  All right, we're gonna keep the show moving i'm just doing a quick mic check if you guys on camera saw me look over make
[15:34.360 --> 15:37.960]  Sure shit is working something didn't sound perfect at the beginning of the show
[15:37.960 --> 15:40.760]  But I think i've got it dialed in you guys don't care
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.080]  You know what? You do care about you care about this next message. This one came from patreon as well
[15:45.400 --> 15:48.280]  Once again patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart
[15:49.080 --> 15:52.200]  It goes a lot like this. This one comes from our friend rasta k. What's up?
[15:52.200 --> 15:57.160]  Rasta kid is good to see you all over the place rasta k is on the dgc a dude grows crew
[15:57.400 --> 16:02.440]  Uh rasta k is also on cannabis. I see rasta k on instagram and now we've got rasta k
[16:02.760 --> 16:09.000]  Showing up on the podcast and in patreon big. Thanks big. Shout out. Let's read rasta k's message. It goes like this
[16:09.000 --> 16:10.120]  What's going on rasta?
[16:10.120 --> 16:16.360]  Jeff, I have been a big fan of the show for the past year and a half and i'm finally able to become a patreon contributor
[16:16.440 --> 16:19.560]  Hey, thank you. I appreciate that. No stress that it took you a while
[16:19.800 --> 16:23.480]  A lot of people are out there that cannot contribute at all. So I do appreciate your support
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.580]  It says I am now a supporter of this podcast as well as the dgc
[16:27.900 --> 16:31.180]  Big shout out to my friends at the dude grow show if you like my show
[16:31.260 --> 16:33.660]  I think you would really appreciate the dude grow show
[16:33.980 --> 16:37.340]  They were gracious enough to invite me on a live grow talk a few days ago
[16:37.340 --> 16:41.980]  I was on their youtube channel had a great time big fist bump to the whole dgc gang
[16:42.220 --> 16:44.220]  Uh big friends of mine nothing but love and respect
[16:44.700 --> 16:49.900]  This goes on to say i've told many guys about this show and especially the watering tech one through five
[16:50.140 --> 16:53.420]  You guys a while back. I did an episode called one through five watering tech
[16:53.660 --> 16:59.500]  I give a very detailed description about watering cocoa. It sounds like that episode worked very well for rasta k
[16:59.500 --> 17:05.100]  So thank you for telling people about the show and thank you for learning and absorbing some information from that episode
[17:05.500 --> 17:10.460]  There is more you guys i'm rambling today. We're gonna blame it on the lush cherry dabs, but it goes on it says
[17:10.700 --> 17:16.940]  I'm a cocoa grower and i've been since starting so this guy's always been growing cocoa or this listener has always been growing with cocoa
[17:17.260 --> 17:19.260]  It says I use biobiz cocoa
[17:19.580 --> 17:27.020]  For buffered and rinsed and will add perlite i'm using 80% cocoa 20% perlite and a few handfuls of rice holes
[17:27.100 --> 17:29.100]  All right, sounds like a good mix so far
[17:29.180 --> 17:34.060]  I'm in three gallon radical bags in a four by four by eight tent sounds like it makes sense
[17:34.460 --> 17:36.460]  I have an arise and a rock bud
[17:36.700 --> 17:41.340]  Rock burt auto and a two by two as i'm waiting to see the sex of the arise
[17:41.580 --> 17:46.300]  Oh, man, I hope you get a good male to female ratio there now it goes on to say
[17:47.260 --> 17:50.940]  My question is when watering cocoa, do you prefer to let it dry out?
[17:51.500 --> 17:54.700]  To what I would say a two and then water to feed to runoff
[17:55.020 --> 18:01.260]  I've been watering my girls every other day one and a half gallons of water and that comes off to 15 to 20 percent runoff
[18:01.340 --> 18:03.340]  They seem to be fine and growing great
[18:03.500 --> 18:09.680]  But i'm hearing and seeing other places that letting cocoa dry out will mess the ph up and have it fluctuating
[18:10.700 --> 18:11.820]  um
[18:11.820 --> 18:16.860]  You kind of answered your question you said should I change something? Should I fix some shit that ain't broken, bro?
[18:16.940 --> 18:22.140]  It is working. It sounds like you're doing a wonderful job. You are watering on a schedule that works for you
[18:22.220 --> 18:25.500]  Nothing is wrong. You have let the internet infect your brain
[18:25.580 --> 18:29.820]  You have heard something that you think would be better if you would like to try that try it
[18:30.140 --> 18:30.860]  um
[18:30.860 --> 18:36.540]  My answer is the plants are always the boss if the cocoa gets to number two dryness in the plants
[18:36.700 --> 18:41.180]  The leaves haven't drooped down and look pissed off let it get to a one and see what they do
[18:41.420 --> 18:44.460]  But if it gets to a one and it's real droopy, that's when the plants are angry
[18:44.460 --> 18:49.820]  So you've got to find that 1.9 balance. Don't let it get to one let it get to 1.9 right below a two
[18:50.140 --> 18:53.100]  But the plants are the boss all of my grow advice
[18:53.660 --> 19:01.280]  Is really uh from experience all of the grow equipment you can buy is really programmed for ideal parameters
[19:01.740 --> 19:07.980]  The plants know exactly what the plants want if you met me, you know that I like dabs and kombucha
[19:07.980 --> 19:13.200]  But you also may not know that I don't like pineapple kombuchas because they taste like fucking sunscreen
[19:13.500 --> 19:17.100]  So they're subtle things you've got to learn and you got to experience to catch on to you
[19:17.180 --> 19:21.500]  So watch the plants if the plants are telling you number two is the sweet spot for you to water me
[19:21.660 --> 19:23.820]  Go for a number two if a number three is where they got it
[19:23.820 --> 19:26.620]  And it sounds weird talking about doing a number two and a number three so much now
[19:26.940 --> 19:30.780]  But if they the plants tell you number three is when to water me go by the plants
[19:30.860 --> 19:36.060]  Don't let the equipment don't let me don't let the internet infect your brain. Let the plants be the boss
[19:36.140 --> 19:41.900]  You are a slave to those fucking plants. Let them make all of the rules as to ph fluctuating in the cocoa
[19:41.980 --> 19:43.580]  That is going to happen
[19:43.580 --> 19:49.100]  Dryness and moisture are going to uh cause ph fluctuations in the cocoa, but you know what?
[19:49.740 --> 19:57.500]  Very slight fluctuations and I find them to be beneficial because we absorb and absorb different nutrients at different ph levels
[19:57.740 --> 20:00.780]  So if it starts off low and goes higher starts off high and goes low
[20:00.780 --> 20:04.780]  You just gave yourself a window to absorb more of those nutrients that were left around in the cocoa
[20:05.020 --> 20:07.740]  So it is not that big of a deal to get a little bit of a swing
[20:07.980 --> 20:11.980]  In your medium that is expected that's going to happen. Don't stress too much over that
[20:12.460 --> 20:16.140]  Um, if it ain't broke don't fix it dude, and it sounds like your grow is doing well, you're getting
[20:16.540 --> 20:20.460]  Uh 15 to 20 percent runoff and you said they seem to be fine and growing great
[20:20.700 --> 20:23.820]  But i'm hearing and seeing other places don't let that infect your brain
[20:24.140 --> 20:29.980]  Do what is great for your plants if you'd like to experiment I encourage it but don't let infections of the brain
[20:30.460 --> 20:32.460]  Mess up your steady success
[20:33.180 --> 20:37.900]  Have some confidence now it goes on it says now I use advanced nutrients perfect sensei for cocoa
[20:37.900 --> 20:43.180]  Which balances my ph to 6.0 in my feed so I don't add ph up or ph down
[20:43.900 --> 20:47.980]  You guys there are some nutrients that if you mix them to the appropriate ratios
[20:47.980 --> 20:53.820]  If you put a five gallon bucket and put in this much of product a this much of b and this much of these additives
[20:53.980 --> 20:58.380]  The ph will always balance excel itself to 6.0. That is a really cool
[20:58.780 --> 21:04.140]  Uh trait, uh, some people like that some don't if you're not wanting to do the ph step that really helps
[21:04.140 --> 21:08.780]  I still check it even with ph perfect nutrients just because i'm paranoid and I have to write it down
[21:08.860 --> 21:15.260]  Anyway, but that is what this person is saying. It goes on to say I am am I cutting myself short by not feeding every day?
[21:15.660 --> 21:19.020]  I will add another reason I let it dry out is because of fungus gnats
[21:19.820 --> 21:23.740]  So the question is am I cutting myself short by not feeding my plants every day?
[21:24.220 --> 21:26.220]  Um, do they look like they're getting?
[21:26.220 --> 21:32.060]  Um underfed do they look like they have a problem if they don't show any yellowing if you don't have a cow mag deficiency
[21:32.060 --> 21:34.860]  If the veins down the middle of the leaves aren't getting pale
[21:35.340 --> 21:40.620]  If you don't get like light coloring or anything if the new growth doesn't look sad if you're not getting any problems
[21:41.100 --> 21:44.620]  You're probably doing just fine. Don't stress over feeding them too frequently
[21:45.100 --> 21:48.060]  If you want to you could hit them with a light feed at the end of the day
[21:48.380 --> 21:50.220]  Or right at that point when you think they're too dry
[21:50.220 --> 21:54.060]  But then you have to reschedule all of your feedings. It sounds like you've got it going right now
[21:54.460 --> 21:57.340]  It sounds like you don't need to fuck up what you've already got dialed in
[21:57.660 --> 22:02.620]  But again, i'm the guy that loves to experiment, but you've got another thing. You said you keep it dry because of fungus gnats
[22:03.420 --> 22:07.580]  That is a very good reason to keep it dry. That is a very good reason to not increase moisture
[22:07.580 --> 22:08.860]  There's no problem
[22:08.860 --> 22:12.620]  With what you've got there's no reason to bring fungus gnats back. It keeps going though
[22:12.620 --> 22:15.500]  It says I added ewc to my last batch of mix
[22:15.740 --> 22:20.060]  And I will never do it again when I was watering every day and having the media moist
[22:20.060 --> 22:23.180]  I would get fungus gnats and larvae. That is very common
[22:23.740 --> 22:27.820]  Uh, you get one fungus net and then you've got all the fungus gnats and they're kind of hard to get rid of
[22:28.220 --> 22:33.820]  It says I used amazing doctor enzymes and got rid of the larvae and was told to let the media dry completely out
[22:34.060 --> 22:36.060]  This was from scotty of the dgc
[22:36.700 --> 22:40.940]  Uh, it sounds like it worked if you let the media if you use they what did you use doctor enzyme?
[22:41.260 --> 22:45.740]  Yeah, those enzymes will get in there and eat the larvae and make those fungus gnats won't not want to be there
[22:45.900 --> 22:48.700]  And then if you let it dry out, they don't want to hang out. They want moisture
[22:49.020 --> 22:52.700]  Uh, they want warm and moist environments and that's where they thrive now. It's too dry
[22:52.780 --> 22:55.180]  It's the fucking desert. They're gonna go find some more moist
[22:55.580 --> 23:00.460]  A big shout out to our friend scotty real for giving you good grow advice buy some recharge
[23:00.700 --> 23:04.140]  It goes on to say since the gnats are gone. Should I start feeding every day again?
[23:04.460 --> 23:07.980]  Or what do you think I know you don't do too much with auto flowers
[23:07.980 --> 23:14.060]  But i'm hoping you can shed some light on watering cocoa and battling gnats. Yeah, I don't mess with auto flowers, but I think
[23:14.460 --> 23:19.820]  Uh soil and soil problems and watering are the same story here. Uh, your plants just went into flower on their own
[23:19.820 --> 23:21.820]  That's the only real difference
[23:22.460 --> 23:29.420]  If your plants want water every day water them every day if the plants do not want water every day don't water them every day
[23:29.820 --> 23:32.220]  Find what the plants like I wish I had better advice for you
[23:32.220 --> 23:36.060]  But the plants are the boss the plants are going to pay the paycheck in the end
[23:36.300 --> 23:41.580]  Not me not you not the lights not the fungus gnats pay attention to the plants
[23:41.580 --> 23:45.820]  The plants are going to tell you if they want more water if they want more food. You sound like a very
[23:46.360 --> 23:49.420]  Intelligent and rational thinking person. I think you've got the right idea
[23:49.820 --> 23:53.900]  How about soak one of those plants the fuck down the next day you probably got multiple plants
[23:53.900 --> 23:57.660]  Let's see. You've got you didn't tell me how many it's none of my business how many I don't know where you are
[23:57.980 --> 24:02.540]  So pick a plant and fucking just soak it see what happens if you water that one plant every day
[24:02.780 --> 24:05.420]  See if you over water it I may get angry at you
[24:05.980 --> 24:09.500]  Expect that experiment that is the best way to find out but just pick one
[24:09.820 --> 24:15.420]  Mark it water that fucker too much. See what it does because i'm really not your plant. I don't know the honest answer
[24:15.900 --> 24:17.500]  uh the fungus gnats
[24:17.500 --> 24:24.400]  Uh, if the doctor enzyme worked, I would say continue using that also you can use things with bacillus thuringiensis
[24:25.260 --> 24:29.500]  I think that is how it's pronounced. It's bt. It's a beneficial bacteria. It is affordable
[24:29.740 --> 24:31.740]  There are many products that have that in there
[24:32.140 --> 24:35.340]  Also, I think that the spinosad may work for them
[24:35.660 --> 24:39.740]  And then you're going to want to do a soil drench mix that up in some water water through the cocoa
[24:39.900 --> 24:45.820]  Let all that pesticide get in there and kill those fungus gnats. So you want the bt or spinosad?
[24:45.980 --> 24:50.220]  I think are going to work well for you an evergreen drench would also do it, but that's a little more
[24:50.460 --> 24:52.460]  Uh, it's a little more brutal on the root zone
[24:52.540 --> 24:55.660]  So if you don't have really healthy plants, that is not something I would do
[24:56.620 --> 25:01.180]  It does go on it says thank you so much brother for everything you do if you have a minute check out my ig
[25:01.260 --> 25:03.740]  I'm rasta k. I think I may be following you
[25:03.820 --> 25:08.540]  If not, i'm following you on cannabis and if i'm not now I will be by the time this episode comes out
[25:08.860 --> 25:10.220]  Uh big thanks big respect
[25:10.220 --> 25:16.140]  It said I started growing maybe 14 gram plants and with the help of the dgc and the grow from your heart podcast
[25:16.220 --> 25:20.860]  I now grow autos. They give me four to six ounces per plant
[25:20.940 --> 25:26.220]  Hey, that is quite an increase you went from 14 grams to four to six ounces. Um,
[25:26.780 --> 25:30.780]  Can't even do the math on that that quickly one two, three, four
[25:31.100 --> 25:35.980]  You four timed it maybe five or six times your production. I don't even know what the fuck i'm saying anymore
[25:36.220 --> 25:40.060]  You went from a half ounce to six of them, that's a good fucking increase dude. Good job. Thank you
[25:40.060 --> 25:44.460]  I'm glad we were able to help you on the path of success and improving your garden
[25:44.460 --> 25:48.780]  That's what we're here for if you've got any more questions, please do send me another email
[25:49.100 --> 25:53.740]  Let me know how the plants are going. Let me know what you've decided to do. Do they need more water?
[25:53.820 --> 25:58.780]  Are they doing okay? And how are the fungus nets? Did you get rid of them fuckers? I want them gone
[25:58.860 --> 26:00.540]  We'll help you get rid of it
[26:00.540 --> 26:02.780]  It does say you can use my name. I'm rasta k
