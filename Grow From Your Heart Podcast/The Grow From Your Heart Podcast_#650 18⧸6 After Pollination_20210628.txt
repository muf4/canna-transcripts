[00:14.770 --> 00:15.770]  Heart podcast.

[01:17.890 --> 01:22.010]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show.

[01:54.650 --> 01:56.210]  It's my least favorite part of the job.
[01:56.210 --> 01:59.970]  So big up to the trim crew without you, we couldn't get it done.
[01:59.970 --> 02:02.890]  All right, let's not chatter too much at the top of the show because I do have a lot of
[02:02.890 --> 02:04.290]  stuff to talk about.
[02:04.290 --> 02:09.130]  Let me start off by sending a big thank you shout out to my friends at Caribou Heart TV.
[02:09.130 --> 02:11.010]  There's a new podcast on YouTube.
[02:11.010 --> 02:12.010]  They're getting going.
[02:12.010 --> 02:13.090]  They're off to a great start.
[02:13.090 --> 02:14.490]  They're called Caribou Heart TV.
[02:14.490 --> 02:19.170]  They've got a great cast of characters, people from all over the country, accents from all
[02:19.170 --> 02:23.010]  over the world, accents from all over the world.
[02:23.010 --> 02:28.050]  I love being on a show with a diverse people, smart people, good accents.
[02:28.050 --> 02:29.090]  There was a Canadian accent.
[02:29.090 --> 02:30.530]  There was a Jersey accent.
[02:30.530 --> 02:31.530]  I love accents.
[02:31.530 --> 02:32.970]  You guys, I just, I love listening to somebody.
[02:32.970 --> 02:35.330]  I'll pay more attention if you have a cool accent.
[02:35.330 --> 02:38.050]  Big shout out to my friends on Caribou Heart TV.
[02:38.050 --> 02:39.370]  We did talk about breeding.
[02:39.370 --> 02:40.410]  We talked about growing.
[02:40.410 --> 02:42.370]  We talked about the industry.
[02:42.370 --> 02:45.630]  There were several other notable breeders on that panel.
[02:45.630 --> 02:48.530]  Big shout out to Miss Jill, big shout out to Jinx Proof.
[02:48.530 --> 02:51.530]  Of course, big shout out to everybody who was on the panel.
[02:51.530 --> 02:55.810]  Big thank you to my friends at Caribou Heart TV for having me on the show.
[02:55.810 --> 02:56.810]  Don't miss it.
[02:56.810 --> 02:57.810]  It is still available on YouTube.
[02:57.810 --> 03:00.130]  Simply search Caribou Heart TV.
[03:00.130 --> 03:02.890]  It is C-A-R-I-B-O-O.
[03:02.890 --> 03:04.450]  I'm not sure if that's how Caribou is spelled.
[03:04.450 --> 03:05.450]  I thought it was a U.
[03:05.450 --> 03:06.450]  I could be wrong.
[03:06.450 --> 03:07.450]  Maybe they're creative.
[03:07.450 --> 03:09.610]  I'm letting you know I searched wrong the first time.
[03:09.610 --> 03:12.330]  It's Caribou with two O's at the end of it.
[03:12.330 --> 03:13.810]  Caribou Heart Genetics.
[03:13.810 --> 03:14.810]  I don't know.
[03:14.810 --> 03:15.810]  Caribou Heart TV.
[03:15.810 --> 03:16.810]  I apologize.
[03:16.810 --> 03:17.810]  I'm high and going fast here.
[03:17.810 --> 03:19.930]  Check out Caribou Heart TV on the YouTube.
[03:19.930 --> 03:20.930]  Thanks, guys.
[03:20.930 --> 03:21.930]  I really enjoyed being on there.
[03:21.930 --> 03:23.810]  Something else I want to talk about.
[03:23.810 --> 03:30.690]  I have noticed that online there are a few websites selling Irie Genetics seeds, Miss
[03:30.690 --> 03:38.530]  Jill seeds, other brand seeds, and we have never done business with those companies.
[03:38.530 --> 03:42.330]  When you are buying seeds, I highly recommend that you are very careful where you spend
[03:42.330 --> 03:43.330]  your money.
[03:43.330 --> 03:45.250]  Do a little bit of research.
[03:45.250 --> 03:49.810]  Most of the reputable popular breeders right now have our own websites, their own websites.
[03:49.890 --> 03:52.010]  You can go to iregenetics.com.
[03:52.010 --> 03:56.050]  You can look on a vendor list.
[03:56.050 --> 03:58.850]  On that list of vendors, there are seven vendors listed.
[03:58.850 --> 03:59.850]  You can click on a link.
[03:59.850 --> 04:01.870]  It goes directly to their website.
[04:01.870 --> 04:04.610]  If the web guy did it right, it goes right to my tab on the website.
[04:04.610 --> 04:07.050]  I haven't gotten to check every link, but shout out to my web guy.
[04:07.050 --> 04:08.810]  You do a great job, bro.
[04:08.810 --> 04:09.810]  Click on the link.
[04:09.810 --> 04:13.310]  It'll take you to the website where those seeds are available.
[04:13.310 --> 04:18.010]  Those are the preferred and recommended and trusted vendors on my website.
[04:18.010 --> 04:20.810]  I put them up there because I've done a lot of business with them.
[04:20.810 --> 04:21.810]  I trust them.
[04:21.810 --> 04:23.210]  I know they are reliable.
[04:23.210 --> 04:27.490]  There are a couple of new vendors that have not been added to the website yet.
[04:27.490 --> 04:29.010]  It takes me a little bit to vet them.
[04:29.010 --> 04:30.210]  I get them seeds.
[04:30.210 --> 04:31.210]  They get going.
[04:31.210 --> 04:32.490]  I make sure they're cool.
[04:32.490 --> 04:33.930]  I do a little bit of recon.
[04:33.930 --> 04:37.250]  Maybe I order seeds from them and they don't even know it was me, or maybe I have a friend
[04:37.250 --> 04:41.170]  order seeds and we just make sure the seeds come in a timely manner, that they're packaged
[04:41.170 --> 04:42.170]  appropriately.
[04:42.170 --> 04:45.050]  I inspect them, make sure they didn't fuck with the packages that I send.
[04:45.050 --> 04:46.970]  I do check on that sort of stuff.
[04:46.970 --> 04:49.890]  Once I'm sure that the companies are legit, they're doing a good job, then we add them
[04:49.890 --> 04:51.210]  up to the website.
[04:51.210 --> 04:56.050]  If you ever have a question about somebody selling Irie Genetics beans, please contact
[04:56.050 --> 04:57.050]  me.
[04:57.050 --> 04:59.010]  Say, is this a legit vendor of Irie seeds?
[04:59.010 --> 05:01.750]  Because maybe I haven't added them to the website right away.
[05:01.750 --> 05:02.750]  Maybe they're new.
[05:02.750 --> 05:05.730]  Maybe they're an auction house doing an auction somewhere with social media.
[05:05.730 --> 05:08.570]  They've got to change their names, their social media quite often.
[05:08.570 --> 05:10.370]  We do have to keep up with stuff like that.
[05:10.370 --> 05:13.710]  But my advice, you guys, if you're ... And I'm not saying just buy Irie seeds.
[05:13.710 --> 05:18.190]  If you're going to buy Irie seeds, Miss Jill seeds, if you're going to buy Jinxproof seeds,
[05:18.190 --> 05:22.030]  whatever brand you were looking at buying, do some research before you spend your money.
[05:22.030 --> 05:24.710]  There are a lot of companies out there that just want your money.
[05:24.710 --> 05:25.710]  They don't care.
[05:25.710 --> 05:28.750]  And now they're taking crypto, cryptocurrency.
[05:28.750 --> 05:30.950]  And once you pay in crypto, there is no recourse.
[05:30.950 --> 05:33.250]  If they steal your crypto, your crypto's gone.
[05:33.250 --> 05:34.390]  There's no customer service.
[05:34.390 --> 05:35.390]  There's no middleman.
[05:35.390 --> 05:37.430]  So you've got to be extra careful now.
[05:37.430 --> 05:38.430]  Crypto's amazing.
[05:38.430 --> 05:39.430]  The future is awesome.
[05:39.430 --> 05:40.430]  The internet is great.
[05:40.430 --> 05:42.430]  But also, it can be a huge trap.
[05:42.430 --> 05:45.310]  It's opened up a lot of doors for a lot of shitty people.
[05:45.310 --> 05:47.990]  A lot of people ... Sometimes you do get seeds.
[05:47.990 --> 05:50.490]  Sometimes you don't even get seeds from some of these vendors.
[05:50.490 --> 05:53.990]  But if they're claiming that they're selling Irie seeds and I've never mentioned them,
[05:53.990 --> 05:57.590]  maybe just send us an email and say, hey, Irie Genetics, is this really a vendor that
[05:57.590 --> 05:58.590]  we can trust?
[05:58.590 --> 05:59.710]  And I'll tell you yes or no.
[05:59.710 --> 06:03.390]  And then you can go to social media and you can say, hey, Rasta Jeff approved this vendor.
[06:03.390 --> 06:04.470]  We can buy stuff from them.
[06:04.470 --> 06:07.230]  You can share that with your friends and let everybody know for me.
[06:07.230 --> 06:09.790]  But yeah, check online before you buy stuff, guys.
[06:09.790 --> 06:13.150]  If it's going to be my seeds, if it's going to be anybody's seeds, please just send us
[06:13.150 --> 06:14.150]  an email.
[06:14.150 --> 06:15.150]  Make sure.
[06:15.150 --> 06:19.510]  But I did say there are a couple of new vendors out there that I have not added to the website
[06:19.510 --> 06:20.510]  yet.
[06:20.510 --> 06:21.510]  They will go up pretty soon.
[06:21.510 --> 06:23.710]  I've got to pass the info to the web guy.
[06:23.710 --> 06:24.710]  He's got to do it.
[06:24.710 --> 06:27.150]  I've got to approve them, first of all, is the main thing here.
[06:27.150 --> 06:28.550]  So be very careful when you're buying seeds.
[06:28.550 --> 06:30.390]  Buy from a reputable vendor.
[06:30.390 --> 06:34.290]  What some of them are doing, they just take your money and they say, thank you.
[06:34.290 --> 06:38.130]  And the cool thing about a website is I can print customer reviews and make it look like
[06:38.130 --> 06:39.130]  part of my website.
[06:39.130 --> 06:43.410]  And I can say like Rasta Jeff donated $10 million to our charity.
[06:43.410 --> 06:46.450]  He came here and fucking healed the sick.
[06:46.450 --> 06:47.930]  He touched little kids and they walked.
[06:47.930 --> 06:49.890]  They were in wheelchairs for their whole lives.
[06:49.890 --> 06:53.990]  There were fucking people with AIDS and cancer and he blew kisses at them and they danced
[06:53.990 --> 06:54.990]  in the streets and they're healed.
[06:54.990 --> 06:56.050]  I can put that on my website.
[06:56.050 --> 06:58.990]  I can make a customer review that looks like that happened.
[06:58.990 --> 07:00.690]  The internet is really easy to manipulate.
[07:00.690 --> 07:05.010]  So you go to a website and you see a thousand good reviews, great shipping, good product,
[07:05.010 --> 07:06.850]  amazing outcome, and you're sold.
[07:06.970 --> 07:08.930]  You know what I mean?
[07:08.930 --> 07:13.650]  But then you buy the shit and the shit either doesn't show up or what does often happen
[07:13.650 --> 07:16.170]  so that these people can keep taking your money.
[07:16.170 --> 07:20.050]  They do send you seeds, but it is nothing like what you expected it to be.
[07:20.050 --> 07:21.050]  It is not my seeds.
[07:21.050 --> 07:22.050]  It's not the stuff I bred.
[07:22.050 --> 07:23.050]  I never touched it.
[07:23.050 --> 07:24.170]  I don't know what it is.
[07:24.170 --> 07:26.090]  They never did any business with me.
[07:26.090 --> 07:28.850]  They don't even have my stuff, but they're saying these are I received.
[07:28.850 --> 07:33.850]  So you buy a package and it's just random seeds that they got from whoever, wherever
[07:33.850 --> 07:36.270]  they could have bred them in their backyard.
[07:36.270 --> 07:39.710]  They could have bought them from a breeder in another country.
[07:39.710 --> 07:41.410]  Their cousin could be doing it.
[07:41.410 --> 07:44.430]  But the point is that those are not the genetics you paid for.
[07:44.430 --> 07:46.630]  You got seeds, but you don't know the pedigree.
[07:46.630 --> 07:47.630]  You don't know the lineage.
[07:47.630 --> 07:48.630]  You don't know the heritage.
[07:48.630 --> 07:52.530]  You're not going to get, when you saw the arise or strawberry starburst on the website,
[07:52.530 --> 07:54.590]  you went, Oh, I want that for a specific reason.
[07:54.590 --> 07:59.670]  A lot of people do a lot of research before they pull the trigger on a pack of seeds.
[07:59.670 --> 08:00.670]  Money's expensive.
[08:00.670 --> 08:01.790]  Seeds are expensive.
[08:01.790 --> 08:06.070]  And I try you guys, I know I'm rambling now, but I try really hard to keep my seeds affordable.
[08:06.870 --> 08:10.430]  I have to be competitive with the market and stay at market rate, but I'm a little bit
[08:10.430 --> 08:15.630]  lower than most of the, uh, the big dogs because, uh, grow from your heart, breed with love,
[08:15.630 --> 08:18.510]  where I'm trying to get the seeds out to the people that don't have a lot of money.
[08:18.510 --> 08:20.150]  You don't need to be rich to be a grower.
[08:20.150 --> 08:23.030]  I don't want you to have a lot of money to be able to get into this club.
[08:23.030 --> 08:24.310]  I want everybody growing.
[08:24.310 --> 08:26.030]  So I try to keep my seeds affordable.
[08:26.030 --> 08:31.350]  I often wonder if when you're scrolling through and you see, uh, like, I'm not even going
[08:31.350 --> 08:35.070]  to say the, the breeder, but some breeders have seeds listed at like three and five and
[08:35.070 --> 08:36.750]  $600 on websites.
[08:36.750 --> 08:38.550]  And then you scroll down and you see mine.
[08:38.550 --> 08:43.030]  They're about 80 bucks on most websites, $80, $90, depending on what shipping is and all
[08:43.030 --> 08:44.030]  that good stuff.
[08:44.030 --> 08:48.230]  It's about 80 to 80 or 90 bucks for a 10 pack of my seeds, which I think is very, very affordable.
[08:48.230 --> 08:54.270]  When you look around, a lot of them are 120, 130, and then you see those 300 and $500 packs.
[08:54.270 --> 08:58.990]  I wonder if that almost devalues my product to people say, well, that's cheap shit because
[08:58.990 --> 09:00.350]  it's cheap shit.
[09:00.350 --> 09:04.990]  But honestly, it's because I don't need to get rich and, uh, trying to get the seeds
[09:04.990 --> 09:05.990]  out.
[09:05.990 --> 09:09.870]  That was the goal was to get good seeds in the hands of good people and good people aren't
[09:09.870 --> 09:10.990]  always rich people.
[09:10.990 --> 09:13.790]  Uh, but be careful you guys, when you're spending your money, be careful.
[09:13.790 --> 09:16.350]  Cause I want you to get what you think you're paying for.
[09:16.350 --> 09:17.830]  You've done all this research.
[09:17.830 --> 09:20.270]  You've fucking watched seven episodes on a rise.
[09:20.270 --> 09:22.390]  You've heard me talk about a rise for five years now.
[09:22.390 --> 09:23.870]  And you're like, I need some arise.
[09:23.870 --> 09:27.190]  And then you go order it and you get it from some company that's never been heard of.
[09:27.190 --> 09:29.710]  And you get the seeds and they're all white and they're not even the right shape.
[09:29.750 --> 09:32.910]  And then when they do grow, they grow all crooked and shitty and they're not what you
[09:32.910 --> 09:33.910]  thought.
[09:33.910 --> 09:36.310]  And then you send me a message going, Hey, these arise seeds fucking suck.
[09:36.310 --> 09:37.310]  And I say, where did you buy them?
[09:37.310 --> 09:39.870]  And then you tell me some random website called this.
[09:39.870 --> 09:41.190]  And I'm like, I've never heard of them.
[09:41.190 --> 09:42.350]  So you don't have my seeds.
[09:42.350 --> 09:44.310]  I apologize that that happened to you.
[09:44.310 --> 09:45.630]  Please do better research.
[09:45.630 --> 09:47.790]  So my advice here, you guys might ramble.
[09:47.790 --> 09:52.950]  The short version of this is check my website, check whoever you're buying seeds from, check
[09:52.950 --> 09:55.670]  their website for a list of reputable vendors.
[09:55.670 --> 10:00.230]  And then when you do find a reputable, reputable vendor, do some research on them.
[10:00.230 --> 10:02.910]  The social media is amazing for this sort of stuff.
[10:02.910 --> 10:04.950]  Pinterest is amazing for this sort of stuff.
[10:04.950 --> 10:07.110]  Discord is amazing for this sort of stuff.
[10:07.110 --> 10:10.110]  I'll give you advice on other breeders.
[10:10.110 --> 10:13.830]  Like if you're looking for somewhere to get any other breeder, I don't even care who you
[10:13.830 --> 10:17.430]  ask me if you can't find them and I know where it's available, I'll tell you where to get
[10:17.430 --> 10:18.430]  it.
[10:18.430 --> 10:20.630]  I don't find any competition between other breeders.
[10:20.630 --> 10:24.910]  I don't see any reason why maybe let's just say I make vanilla cake, right?
[10:25.150 --> 10:26.310]  I'm the pro at making vanilla cake.
[10:26.310 --> 10:29.830]  If you want chocolate, I have no problem telling you where to get chocolate cake because when
[10:29.830 --> 10:33.150]  you want vanilla, you're going to come get vanilla cake from me all day.
[10:33.150 --> 10:37.190]  I have no problem sharing sources and resources and all that good stuff.
[10:37.190 --> 10:40.030]  All right, I got stoner and I got fucking rambly.
[10:40.030 --> 10:43.870]  That is a good way to segue into the next topic of this podcast.
[10:43.870 --> 10:51.590]  You guys, I smoked some rosin earlier today from a 14er and it was some papaya cake and
[10:51.590 --> 10:53.950]  I'm not usually a rosin smoker.
[10:53.990 --> 10:58.030]  You guys hear me talk about smoking green dot batter, green dot diamonds all the time.
[10:58.030 --> 11:03.270]  My favorite local dispensary has made some changes and there are also rule changes coming
[11:03.270 --> 11:04.750]  up here in Colorado.
[11:04.750 --> 11:10.630]  So things are changing with availability of concentrates in the stores, which why you
[11:10.630 --> 11:15.090]  heard in a previous episode, I was smoking concentrates made by a friend, a local person
[11:15.090 --> 11:17.830]  who made some stuff themselves.
[11:17.830 --> 11:20.150]  I prefer, I just prefer good concentrates.
[11:20.150 --> 11:21.950]  I don't even care if it came from a person or a store.
[11:21.950 --> 11:27.030]  I prefer good, clean, safe concentrates, but I think I prefer a batter, but I've been shopping
[11:27.030 --> 11:31.270]  and buying different things just because it's there and I can't get what I want.
[11:31.270 --> 11:37.430]  Sometimes I hit this 14 or batter and the change up was changing up from what I'm usually
[11:37.430 --> 11:39.710]  used to smoking to go into this batter.
[11:39.710 --> 11:41.310]  It was like a whole new buzz.
[11:41.310 --> 11:42.310]  It kicked my ass.
[11:42.310 --> 11:46.310]  It may have put me down into the couch and made me take a little bit of a nappy poo on
[11:46.310 --> 11:47.650]  the couch for a couple of minutes.
[11:47.650 --> 11:53.570]  So big shout out to 14er, I think that it's called 14 or extracts or 14 or the papaya
[11:53.570 --> 11:54.570]  cake.
[11:54.570 --> 11:59.090]  I said that really weird papaya cake put me on my ass for a few minutes, had to regroup.
[11:59.090 --> 12:01.130]  I had to get my shit together.
[12:01.130 --> 12:05.210]  But what that wanted me to talk about, what that got me want to talk about was, do you
[12:05.210 --> 12:08.250]  have crazy dreams when you smoke?
[12:08.250 --> 12:11.290]  Like if I take a dab and I'm like, Oh, I'm going to lay on the couch after that one and
[12:11.290 --> 12:16.610]  doze off for a minute, that little short nap that I take, I can go on the most amazing
[12:16.610 --> 12:18.450]  adventures in my dreams.
[12:18.450 --> 12:21.770]  The most amazing vivid dreams.
[12:21.770 --> 12:26.170]  I see people that are in my life and we have deep conversations about shit.
[12:26.170 --> 12:27.410]  We solve world hunger.
[12:27.410 --> 12:32.830]  We build towers, we build lasers, we go to other planets.
[12:32.830 --> 12:34.570]  Sometimes I wake up and I have to like Google shit.
[12:34.570 --> 12:35.810]  Like did this happen?
[12:35.810 --> 12:40.050]  Because I had a really intense dream that fucking like California slipped off the fucking
[12:40.050 --> 12:43.830]  earth and fell into the ocean and they're sending drones out there to rescue people
[12:43.830 --> 12:45.650]  and sharks are eating people and shit.
[12:45.690 --> 12:48.850]  Like that's the kind of shit that I'll dream about and it will be vivid.
[12:48.850 --> 12:52.050]  A lot of time, a lot of time, this is fucking weird.
[12:52.050 --> 12:54.210]  I dream that I'm late for a concert.
[12:54.210 --> 12:58.770]  A lot of times it is a Phil and friends or fish concert and my buddy Robbie and I, what's
[12:58.770 --> 13:00.650]  up Robbie the dude, I hope you're watching.
[13:00.650 --> 13:04.490]  We will, I'll be dreaming and I'll have to drive to get to Rob and then when I get to
[13:04.490 --> 13:08.690]  Rob I'm like, cool, I'm going to get Rob and we're driving to the music.
[13:08.690 --> 13:12.410]  But it always ends up, I get Rob and we're driving and we get to the place.
[13:12.410 --> 13:13.970]  Rob's like, take a left, bro, take a right.
[13:13.970 --> 13:18.130]  Because Rob used to be my navigator on road trips before we had all this technology.
[13:18.130 --> 13:19.650]  Rob would be like, take a right, bro, take a left.
[13:19.650 --> 13:22.090]  He'd have the map in his hands and shit.
[13:22.090 --> 13:24.250]  And then we get somewhere and I'd be like, bro, there's no concert here.
[13:24.250 --> 13:28.370]  And he's like, no, bro, this is the airport where the plane is to get us to the other
[13:28.370 --> 13:30.730]  island to get us to the boat to get us to the concert.
[13:30.730 --> 13:34.130]  And I'm like, mother, like we only have an hour to do all of this.
[13:34.130 --> 13:36.850]  I don't know why my dreams are so stressful, you guys, but I'll dream that I'm going to
[13:36.850 --> 13:38.850]  miss this damn fish show.
[13:38.850 --> 13:42.450]  And it's just, it's always with Robbie and it's always because it's really crazy.
[13:42.570 --> 13:45.970]  And then we show up and I dreamt one time that there was nobody else at the fish show
[13:45.970 --> 13:49.930]  because nobody else realized you had to go from the airport to the island, to the bus,
[13:49.930 --> 13:52.970]  to the fucking little boat, to this thing, to the fucking little puddle jumper, to the
[13:52.970 --> 13:55.250]  hovercraft, to the fucking walkway.
[13:55.250 --> 13:58.130]  And me and Robbie were the only ones at the fish show and we got to call out songs all
[13:58.130 --> 13:59.130]  night.
[13:59.130 --> 14:00.130]  That was kind of cool.
[14:00.130 --> 14:02.530]  But those are the kind of fucking dreams I will have if I smoke some good concentrates
[14:02.530 --> 14:04.290]  and then fall asleep.
[14:04.290 --> 14:06.530]  I had some crazy dreams on the couch today, bro.
[14:06.530 --> 14:08.690]  Just wondering if you guys have crazy dreams.
[14:08.690 --> 14:12.090]  Send me some feedback, post it on the Patreon, post it on the Twitter.
[14:12.450 --> 14:13.450]  There is a Twitter.
[14:13.450 --> 14:18.690]  It's at GFYH podcast, post it up on the social media, send me an email, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[14:18.690 --> 14:19.690]  Do you dream?
[14:19.690 --> 14:24.290]  Some of my friends say that when they smoke, they don't dream at all, which I find a man
[14:24.290 --> 14:26.130]  that I would, that'd just be such a bummer.
[14:26.130 --> 14:28.170]  I love the crazy, crazy dreams.
[14:28.170 --> 14:29.930]  All right, I'm stoned and rambling.
[14:29.930 --> 14:31.810]  I did say that I had some emails.
[14:31.810 --> 14:32.850]  Let's get into that part of the show.
[14:32.850 --> 14:41.570]  You guys, this one came from, this one came from the IRI Genetics website, IRIgenetics.com
[14:41.570 --> 14:43.770]  On that website, there is a grow help tab.
[14:43.770 --> 14:47.650]  If you click on the grow help tab, it takes you to the grow help section.
[14:47.650 --> 14:50.890]  We do ask you about 10 preliminary questions.
[14:50.890 --> 14:52.670]  Things like, what's your name?
[14:52.670 --> 14:54.250]  What name should we use on the podcast?
[14:54.250 --> 14:55.930]  What strain are you growing?
[14:55.930 --> 14:56.930]  Basic questions.
[14:56.930 --> 14:58.510]  We don't ask you anything too invasive.
[14:58.510 --> 14:59.650]  This helps me help you.
[14:59.650 --> 15:03.130]  If I have a little bit of information, I know what's going on in your grow.
[15:03.130 --> 15:06.610]  This is just like checking your pulse, checking your temperature, making sure that you're
[15:06.610 --> 15:07.610]  alive.
[15:07.610 --> 15:11.010]  This is a little bit of a little waiting room, a little check in stuff here.
[15:11.450 --> 15:13.850]  This came from the website, the grow help tab.
[15:13.850 --> 15:15.330]  You answer those quick few questions.
[15:15.330 --> 15:19.010]  Then at the bottom, there's an opportunity to type in and tell me what your problem is.
[15:19.010 --> 15:21.490]  And then I do my best to help you.
[15:21.490 --> 15:22.490]  So let's jump right into it.
[15:22.490 --> 15:26.050]  This one came from, it says name to use on the podcast, R-Dog.
[15:26.050 --> 15:27.050]  What up R-Dog?
[15:27.050 --> 15:29.090]  Thank you for the message.
[15:29.090 --> 15:31.250]  Their strain they're growing is magic melon.
[15:31.250 --> 15:32.890]  They're growing it outdoors.
[15:32.890 --> 15:34.210]  They're growing under the sun.
[15:34.210 --> 15:36.870]  The plants are in veg, they're in soil.
[15:36.870 --> 15:40.890]  We do ask about the feeding and stuff, but that doesn't matter for this question.
[15:41.770 --> 15:42.770]  I already know what's going on here.
[15:42.770 --> 15:43.970]  So we've got some plants outdoor.
[15:43.970 --> 15:44.970]  We're growing magic melon.
[15:44.970 --> 15:46.650]  I've never heard of magic melon.
[15:46.650 --> 15:48.970]  That sounds pretty nice.
[15:48.970 --> 15:50.450]  Magic is always good in a strain name.
[15:50.450 --> 15:52.410]  Get your fucking high, get your buzzed in melon.
[15:52.410 --> 15:54.930]  Who doesn't like melon flavored products?
[15:54.930 --> 15:56.190]  I'm way off topic.
[15:56.190 --> 15:57.190]  Let's get back to it.
[15:57.190 --> 15:59.010]  I have one plant that I put outside.
[15:59.010 --> 16:00.850]  All right, we've got a plant outside.
[16:00.850 --> 16:01.850]  It started flowering.
[16:01.850 --> 16:03.050]  That makes sense.
[16:03.050 --> 16:08.210]  I'm thinking it may have been from not up potting it soon enough, but I don't know.
[16:08.210 --> 16:09.210]  Let's get confused.
[16:09.210 --> 16:15.010]  When we take them from HID lighting on a schedule that's fucking solid, solid schedule and the
[16:15.010 --> 16:18.730]  same thing every day, and then we put them outside in nature, they got a little bit of
[16:18.730 --> 16:19.730]  a change.
[16:19.730 --> 16:24.050]  They're experiencing far red and phytochrome experiences they've never had before.
[16:24.050 --> 16:26.450]  Plants kind of trip out when you put them outside if it's not the right time, if they
[16:26.450 --> 16:29.810]  aren't timed just right.
[16:29.810 --> 16:32.570]  That's an outdoor grower with a lot of experience who could teach you more about that.
[16:32.570 --> 16:33.970]  Jesse is the guy to talk to there.
[16:33.970 --> 16:37.330]  So you got to time it right or they will go into flower and then they will go back into
[16:37.450 --> 16:39.570]  re-veg, which is what I think is going to happen here.
[16:39.570 --> 16:43.050]  It says, I up potted to a three gallon from a one gallon.
[16:43.050 --> 16:48.010]  I let her get settled in and I decided to pollinate with some pollen I collected from
[16:48.010 --> 16:49.010]  a male.
[16:49.010 --> 16:51.090]  So we've got a plant that's outside.
[16:51.090 --> 16:52.330]  It started to flower.
[16:52.330 --> 16:54.970]  It got pollinated with some pollen.
[16:54.970 --> 16:57.690]  That makes totally good sense so far.
[16:57.690 --> 17:02.370]  It says, here we are about two weeks later and she looks like she is re-vegging.
[17:02.370 --> 17:06.610]  Yeah, the season right now, the plants will re-veg.
[17:06.610 --> 17:07.890]  They'll start re-vegging for you.
[17:07.890 --> 17:08.890]  It'll go kind of crazy.
[17:08.890 --> 17:09.890]  It'll get bigger.
[17:09.890 --> 17:11.570]  It'll grow stronger and longer.
[17:11.570 --> 17:15.050]  And then it's going to flower here, I think August, right?
[17:15.050 --> 17:16.050]  August.
[17:16.050 --> 17:17.050]  I don't even remember, dude.
[17:17.050 --> 17:20.330]  Jesse taught me, but I'm an indoor guy, so I don't pay too much attention to this.
[17:20.330 --> 17:24.090]  Anyway, the question is, will she make seeds?
[17:24.090 --> 17:26.250]  The short answer is yeah.
[17:26.250 --> 17:31.190]  All of those pollination sites, all of those, the pistils, they were pollinated.
[17:31.190 --> 17:36.490]  If you have got a pollinated ovule and that seed has begun, yes, it will make seeds.
[17:36.890 --> 17:40.450]  The plant has shifted all of its energy now to making seeds.
[17:40.450 --> 17:42.970]  It's not going to focus on making THC.
[17:42.970 --> 17:47.450]  It's going to focus on making, or CBD or whatever the cannabinoid profile of that plant may
[17:47.450 --> 17:48.450]  be.
[17:48.450 --> 17:51.610]  It's going to shift gears now and work on making seeds.
[17:51.610 --> 17:52.730]  It's going to make different oils.
[17:52.730 --> 17:55.690]  It's going to go into a different, just a different goal of life.
[17:55.690 --> 17:59.330]  Now, that plant's whole goal before pollination was to receive pollen.
[17:59.330 --> 18:02.370]  It was just like, pollinate me please, please, please, and you did it.
[18:02.370 --> 18:04.290]  And now it's like, I'm shifting gears.
[18:04.290 --> 18:05.290]  Now I'm pregnant.
[18:05.290 --> 18:06.290]  I'm protecting my babies.
[18:07.090 --> 18:08.090]  I have big, healthy, strong babies.
[18:08.090 --> 18:09.090]  My defenses are a little bit different.
[18:09.090 --> 18:10.090]  It's shifting gears.
[18:10.090 --> 18:14.130]  So yes, it is going to continue to make seeds.
[18:14.130 --> 18:19.010]  Your plant will go back into veg and then it will continue to make seeds while it's
[18:19.010 --> 18:20.010]  vegging.
[18:20.010 --> 18:23.530]  Then it'll go into flower and continue to make seeds while it's flowering.
[18:23.530 --> 18:28.690]  So you may get some lower parts that are seeded and then as the plant goes into veg and grows
[18:28.690 --> 18:32.750]  more, it'll grow more new growth and then it'll go into flower and you may have new
[18:32.750 --> 18:35.890]  buds that aren't even seeded or you may have crazy reveg.
[18:36.490 --> 18:38.490]  I don't know how hard your plant is going to reveg.
[18:38.490 --> 18:39.490]  I don't know the genetics.
[18:39.490 --> 18:40.490]  I don't know.
[18:40.490 --> 18:43.490]  This is going to be very plant specific, very much so.
[18:43.490 --> 18:45.890]  I want to talk about something else.
[18:45.890 --> 18:48.490]  This is what I do when I'm breeding indoors.
[18:48.490 --> 18:51.490]  I talk about this a lot and people think I'm crazy.
[18:51.490 --> 18:54.490]  I've said it a few times on the show and people always send me messages.
[18:54.490 --> 18:56.490]  They're like, is that really what you meant to say?
[18:56.490 --> 19:02.090]  To where I have to type the numbers 18-6 in the titles of the episode so that people really
[19:02.090 --> 19:04.090]  believe me that that's what I'm talking about.
[19:04.090 --> 19:05.690]  Here's what I do when I'm breeding seeds.
[19:06.490 --> 19:10.290]  You guys are purchasing the seeds that come from seedsherenow.com, from Heritage Seed
[19:10.290 --> 19:14.290]  Bank, from Golden Ticket Seeds, from El Fuego Seeds, from Chi-Town Seeds.
[19:14.290 --> 19:17.290]  I know I'm missing somebody, but I love you guys all equally.
[19:18.290 --> 19:22.290]  Those seeds that you are purchasing, those are made with this method.
[19:22.290 --> 19:25.290]  I pollinate the plants naturally, normally, like we normally do it.
[19:25.290 --> 19:26.290]  I get the male into flower.
[19:26.290 --> 19:28.290]  I get the females into flower.
[19:28.290 --> 19:31.290]  Some females want to get pollinated around day 25.
[19:31.290 --> 19:34.290]  Some want pollen around day 32.
[19:34.290 --> 19:35.890]  I stagger the female plants in the room.
[19:35.890 --> 19:39.890]  I get the male pollinating to where he's really dumping a lot of pollen, busting a big load.
[19:39.890 --> 19:43.890]  When it's the right time, drag the boy over to the girls, put him right in the middle
[19:43.890 --> 19:45.890]  of the girls, give him a good shake.
[19:45.890 --> 19:47.890]  Then I wait three to five days.
[19:47.890 --> 19:49.890]  Then I give him another good shake.
[19:49.890 --> 19:51.890]  At this point, I'm done with the male plant.
[19:51.890 --> 19:52.890]  I will cut him down.
[19:52.890 --> 19:57.890]  Honestly, I beat him against the fucking ceiling so that all that pollen rains down all over the plant.
[19:57.890 --> 19:59.890]  Sometimes I'll smack him against the fan.
[19:59.890 --> 20:03.890]  It's really funny when the fan is spinning and you smack a male plant against the fan,
[20:03.890 --> 20:05.490]  the pollen just goes fucking everywhere.
[20:05.490 --> 20:06.490]  It is disgusting.
[20:06.490 --> 20:07.490]  You taste it.
[20:07.490 --> 20:08.490]  It gets in your hair.
[20:08.490 --> 20:09.490]  It gets in your dreads.
[20:09.490 --> 20:10.490]  You really got to clean that shit up.
[20:10.490 --> 20:13.490]  Unless you're a savage breeder, I wouldn't really recommend doing that.
[20:13.490 --> 20:15.490]  For a breeder, that's the way to do it.
[20:15.490 --> 20:18.490]  Take the dude over there, smack him, get that pollen everywhere.
[20:18.490 --> 20:20.490]  The girls are now, they've been double pollinated.
[20:20.490 --> 20:22.490]  They've taken two loads of pollen.
[20:22.490 --> 20:26.490]  I'm sure that every pistol in that fucking room has received pollen.
[20:26.490 --> 20:27.490]  There is pollen everywhere.
[20:27.490 --> 20:28.490]  I'm tasting it.
[20:28.490 --> 20:29.490]  It's in my teeth.
[20:29.490 --> 20:32.490]  I got this gritty taste in my teeth.
[20:33.090 --> 20:35.090]  It is funky in there.
[20:35.090 --> 20:38.090]  We have achieved successful pollination.
[20:38.090 --> 20:42.090]  At this point, I'll wait three, maybe five days, sometimes a little bit longer.
[20:42.090 --> 20:47.090]  I want to watch the pistols curl up and I want to be sure that those girls are pregnant.
[20:47.090 --> 20:49.090]  I want to make sure the pollination has taken place.
[20:49.090 --> 20:54.090]  Once I see the, when plants get pollinated, the pistols will start to wither up and turn brown.
[20:54.090 --> 21:01.090]  That's why I always say pistols are never a guide or a determining factor to help you determine ripeness.
[21:01.690 --> 21:07.690]  Pistols can get withered up from getting touched, getting sprayed, getting pollinated, getting too hot, too cold, too moist, too dry.
[21:07.690 --> 21:08.690]  Those will wither up.
[21:08.690 --> 21:12.690]  Don't ever let those trick you into thinking the plant's ready because they've done something.
[21:12.690 --> 21:14.690]  You could simply have a pollinated plant.
[21:14.690 --> 21:16.690]  A spider could have crawled across there.
[21:16.690 --> 21:17.690]  You could have touched it.
[21:17.690 --> 21:18.690]  Anything could have fucked that up.
[21:18.690 --> 21:21.690]  Too hot, too cold, too dry, wind, all kinds of stuff.
[21:21.690 --> 21:24.690]  Anyway, after pollination, those pistols will wither.
[21:24.690 --> 21:27.690]  They'll start shrinking in, turning brown, changing shape.
[21:28.290 --> 21:31.290]  In a few days, you'll just start seeing something different looking.
[21:31.290 --> 21:33.290]  The buds don't look like they normally do.
[21:33.290 --> 21:36.290]  Normally, where you've got a calyx forming, it looks a little bit harder.
[21:36.290 --> 21:38.290]  It's got like something going on.
[21:38.290 --> 21:39.290]  It's a seed in there.
[21:39.290 --> 21:40.290]  That's what that is.
[21:40.290 --> 21:41.290]  The seed is forming.
[21:41.290 --> 21:50.290]  Once I see that seed, you might think I'm crazy, but I switch my lights back to 18 hours on and 6 hours off.
[21:50.290 --> 21:53.290]  That's a 24-hour light cycle of 18 on and 6 off.
[21:53.290 --> 21:55.290]  Why would I do that?
[21:55.890 --> 21:59.890]  The goal is no longer to produce a big fat bud that's coated in trichomes
[21:59.890 --> 22:04.890]  and is going to get all trimmed up and be pretty and posted in a magazine and then get smoked.
[22:04.890 --> 22:07.890]  This bud is loaded with seeds.
[22:07.890 --> 22:11.890]  I'm going to cut this plant down and grind it up with gloves on.
[22:11.890 --> 22:14.890]  I'm just going to grind it up over a bowl and it's going to drop seeds.
[22:14.890 --> 22:15.890]  It's just going to be dust.
[22:15.890 --> 22:20.890]  All of that plant material is going into a compost pile or a bokashi bucket
[22:21.490 --> 22:25.490]  It's not going to be used as smokable, consumable flower in any way.
[22:25.490 --> 22:27.490]  It is all being grown for seed.
[22:27.490 --> 22:32.490]  So if you're growing for just seed at this point, flip that bitch to 18-6.
[22:32.490 --> 22:37.490]  Now we are getting more light energy per day.
[22:37.490 --> 22:42.490]  In my opinion, I think light is the number one most useful nutrient,
[22:42.490 --> 22:47.490]  whatever you want to call it, the source of life energy for that plant.
[22:47.490 --> 22:50.490]  Light is what it wants more than anything.
[22:51.090 --> 22:52.090]  It gives the plant more light.
[22:52.090 --> 22:53.090]  It gives the plant more energy.
[22:53.090 --> 22:57.090]  It gives it more time per day to build healthy babies.
[22:57.090 --> 22:58.090]  It's getting more light.
[22:58.090 --> 23:00.090]  It's doing photosynthesis.
[23:00.090 --> 23:02.090]  It's saying, hey, I got all this light to work with.
[23:02.090 --> 23:03.090]  It's going to be a long day.
[23:03.090 --> 23:04.090]  I can work out all day.
[23:04.090 --> 23:08.090]  I'm out here lifting weights or it's in the garden or whatever you do that keeps you healthy.
[23:08.090 --> 23:10.090]  It's doing that all day long.
[23:10.090 --> 23:14.090]  It's got six more hours to do it than the plants that are only getting 12-12.
[23:14.690 --> 23:18.690]  What I find by leaving the lights on for the extra six hours,
[23:18.690 --> 23:25.690]  my seeds are harder and thicker and fatter and prettier and healthier
[23:25.690 --> 23:30.690]  and a more successful germination rate and more vigorous plants
[23:30.690 --> 23:33.690]  than the plants that I was leaving under a 12-12 flowering cycle.
[23:33.690 --> 23:39.690]  Something I have also noticed is these plants, these seeds, finish a little bit earlier.
[23:40.290 --> 23:44.290]  Sometimes it will take 10 weeks, 11 weeks for a seed to get good and hard.
[23:44.290 --> 23:48.290]  When I'm doing it in this method, they're done in 8 weeks, maybe 9.
[23:48.290 --> 23:49.290]  But it's quicker.
[23:49.290 --> 23:55.290]  It's 10-14 days quicker most of the time, sometimes a little bit longer depending on the cultivar.
[23:55.290 --> 23:57.290]  Some plants just want to take a long time to make seeds.
[23:57.290 --> 23:59.290]  Some really just want to take forever.
[23:59.290 --> 24:01.290]  Some of them will spit out seeds in no time.
[24:01.290 --> 24:04.290]  It's really amazing and really just watching different plants do this.
[24:04.290 --> 24:08.290]  When I breed to the Platinum Tangy, that's where the Sun Kiss comes from,
[24:08.890 --> 24:09.890]  the Orange Gasm comes from.
[24:09.890 --> 24:11.890]  That one wants pollen really early.
[24:11.890 --> 24:14.890]  And when she gets hit with that pollen, those seeds are done before everybody else.
[24:14.890 --> 24:16.890]  So I can take her down early.
[24:16.890 --> 24:20.890]  The Strawberry Starburst on the other hand, which is what makes the Strawberry Fields
[24:20.890 --> 24:23.890]  and other stuff that's going to be released here in the future,
[24:23.890 --> 24:25.890]  we'll talk about that soon.
[24:25.890 --> 24:28.890]  That one, she wants pollen closer to day 30.
[24:28.890 --> 24:33.890]  So the Sun Kiss or the Platinum Tangy wants pollen like day 23-25.
[24:34.490 --> 24:39.490]  Strawberry Fields wants the pollen around day 30, 27, day 32 in that range
[24:39.490 --> 24:42.490]  is when it's best to pollinate her for maximum pollination.
[24:42.490 --> 24:45.490]  I can hit her early, but she's not going to make as many seeds
[24:45.490 --> 24:48.490]  as she would if I waited and gave her time to make more fuzz.
[24:48.490 --> 24:52.490]  That little, the hairs, the pistils, the more of those, the more seeds I'm able to make.
[24:52.490 --> 24:54.490]  So give her a little bit longer.
[24:54.490 --> 24:58.490]  But by then, that fucking Platinum Tangy plant is almost done.
[24:58.490 --> 25:00.490]  The seeds are already getting formed in the plant.
[25:00.490 --> 25:02.490]  I haven't even pollinated the other plant yet.
[25:03.090 --> 25:05.090]  I have because I stagger the start times, honestly.
[25:05.090 --> 25:08.090]  But that plant's going to take 10 weeks for those seeds to get ready.
[25:08.090 --> 25:10.090]  The other one's going to take 7.
[25:10.090 --> 25:12.090]  So that's why sometimes things are sold out.
[25:12.090 --> 25:14.090]  That's why things are staggered.
[25:14.090 --> 25:17.090]  But that is mainly why I do the 18-6,
[25:17.090 --> 25:20.090]  because it makes my seeds finish a little bit more quickly.
[25:20.090 --> 25:23.090]  I think they are stronger, harder, bigger, faster.
[25:23.090 --> 25:26.090]  I have more successful seeds.
[25:26.090 --> 25:29.090]  If you're a breeder and you've made a whole room of seeds,
[25:29.690 --> 25:33.690]  you'll notice that you get a portion of your seeds are those white, unusable seeds.
[25:33.690 --> 25:35.690]  Excuse me.
[25:35.690 --> 25:37.690]  Some of your seeds you're going to make are going to be throwaway seeds.
[25:37.690 --> 25:39.690]  You just got to toss them or keep them for yourself and grow them.
[25:39.690 --> 25:41.690]  Don't share them. Don't sell them.
[25:41.690 --> 25:43.690]  Because people freak out when you give them those ugly white seeds.
[25:43.690 --> 25:46.690]  I get less of those when I do the 18-6 method.
[25:46.690 --> 25:50.690]  I find that I just have more successful seeds in the batch.
[25:50.690 --> 25:53.690]  Also, this is not a sales pitch for Canon LEDs.
[25:53.690 --> 25:57.690]  In my experience, I'm getting better seeds under LEDs.
[25:58.290 --> 26:01.290]  I'm getting better seeds under LEDs running them on 18-6.
[26:01.290 --> 26:06.290]  That is the magic fucking formula, in my opinion, for making seeds.
[26:06.290 --> 26:08.290]  It's what I've had the most success with.
[26:08.290 --> 26:11.290]  LEDs on 18-6 after pollination.
[26:11.290 --> 26:14.290]  So, the question here that got all this started was,
[26:14.290 --> 26:16.290]  is this going to work?
[26:16.290 --> 26:18.290]  Yes, this is going to work for you.
[26:18.290 --> 26:22.290]  You're going to have seeds and your plants will re-veg for a little bit
[26:22.290 --> 26:24.290]  and they'll go back into flower and you'll have seeds.
[26:24.890 --> 26:28.890]  If you're doing this indoors, you're leaving them on 18-6 indefinitely.
[26:28.890 --> 26:30.890]  They don't go back into flower.
[26:30.890 --> 26:34.890]  What will begin to happen is you will have a plant that is filled with seeds
[26:34.890 --> 26:38.890]  and the top buds of the plant will start making re-veg shoots.
[26:38.890 --> 26:40.890]  If you leave them long enough, they'll re-veg and make full-on clones
[26:40.890 --> 26:43.890]  out of the top of these flowered plants that have seeds.
[26:43.890 --> 26:47.890]  You've got the opportunity to go in there and cut clones off of those plants.
[26:47.890 --> 26:49.890]  If you did not save your genetics, now is your time.
[26:49.890 --> 26:51.890]  You've got these genetics again.
[26:51.890 --> 26:53.890]  You can rescue them right now.
[26:54.490 --> 26:56.490]  Another thing I do that people think is crazy,
[26:56.490 --> 26:58.490]  I do this to plants that are not seeded.
[26:58.490 --> 27:03.490]  This is for my usable, smokable, consumable product.
[27:03.490 --> 27:05.490]  This is what I'm doing with finished product,
[27:05.490 --> 27:10.490]  flowers that I intend to smoke myself, or with Mike, or with patients,
[27:10.490 --> 27:12.490]  or however it ends up.
[27:12.490 --> 27:14.490]  This is what I really do.
[27:14.490 --> 27:18.490]  The last 14, maybe 10 days, depending on the strain in the room
[27:18.490 --> 27:22.490]  and the needs of the room, I do put my lights back on 18-6
[27:23.090 --> 27:25.090]  for my flowering plants.
[27:25.090 --> 27:27.090]  I do this for the same reason that I do the seeded plants.
[27:27.090 --> 27:31.090]  I feel that light is the number one source of light and energy for our plants.
[27:31.090 --> 27:33.090]  You've got lights, air, water, and soil.
[27:33.090 --> 27:35.090]  There's not a lot to think about. Lights, I think, are number one.
[27:35.090 --> 27:39.090]  So, I put the lights back on 18-6 for the last 10 days,
[27:39.090 --> 27:41.090]  maybe the last 14 days,
[27:41.090 --> 27:45.090]  and I noticed the plants get bigger, fatter, beefier, bulkier.
[27:45.090 --> 27:47.090]  They just bulk up.
[27:47.090 --> 27:49.090]  That extra light energy gives them more energy to grow,
[27:49.090 --> 27:51.090]  to bulk up, to beef up,
[27:51.690 --> 27:53.690]  and that's what we want right at the end.
[27:53.690 --> 27:55.690]  Now, people are going to say,
[27:55.690 --> 27:57.690]  you're putting my flowering plants on 18-6 from 12-12.
[27:57.690 --> 27:59.690]  That's going to fuck up my crop.
[27:59.690 --> 28:01.690]  My plants are going to go back into a vegetative stage.
[28:01.690 --> 28:05.690]  Yes, if you don't cut them down in 10-14 days,
[28:05.690 --> 28:07.690]  they will go back into veg,
[28:07.690 --> 28:09.690]  but we're looking to harvest here in 10-14 days anyway.
[28:09.690 --> 28:11.690]  That's not going to happen.
[28:11.690 --> 28:13.690]  You've got time for that to happen.
[28:13.690 --> 28:15.690]  You're going to cut them down before that.
[28:15.690 --> 28:17.690]  So, you've got to do this with a plant, with a cultivar,
[28:17.690 --> 28:19.690]  you are experienced in growing.
[28:20.290 --> 28:22.290]  Something you know, this plant takes 64 days.
[28:22.290 --> 28:24.290]  Do it to a plant that you know.
[28:24.290 --> 28:26.290]  Then, at day 50,
[28:26.290 --> 28:28.290]  flip that fucking timer back to 18-6.
[28:28.290 --> 28:30.290]  You may be able to cut that plant down.
[28:30.290 --> 28:32.290]  Instead of 64, you may be cutting it down at day 60.
[28:32.290 --> 28:34.290]  So, when you start flushing,
[28:34.290 --> 28:36.290]  flip that timer back to 18-6.
[28:36.290 --> 28:38.290]  Pay very close attention to your trichomes,
[28:38.290 --> 28:40.290]  and pay attention to the tips of the tops of the buds
[28:40.290 --> 28:42.290]  at the very top of the plant.
[28:42.290 --> 28:44.290]  If the plant should decide to go back into vegetative stage,
[28:44.290 --> 28:46.290]  you're going to have to cut that plant down.
[28:46.290 --> 28:48.290]  You're going to have to cut it down
[28:48.890 --> 28:50.890]  and decide to go back into veg.
[28:50.890 --> 28:52.890]  It will happen at the very tip top of the very top bud
[28:52.890 --> 28:54.890]  on that plant, and you'll see it.
[28:54.890 --> 28:56.890]  It'll just look different.
[28:56.890 --> 28:58.890]  It'll look like the bud and the bud,
[28:58.890 --> 29:00.890]  and then there'll be just a little thing coming out of the top.
[29:00.890 --> 29:02.890]  Harvest now. It's starting to revege.
[29:02.890 --> 29:04.890]  It's not a big deal if it starts,
[29:04.890 --> 29:06.890]  but take note.
[29:06.890 --> 29:08.890]  At fucking 12 days into 18-6,
[29:08.890 --> 29:10.890]  it was time.
[29:10.890 --> 29:12.890]  You just cut two days off your harvest time.
[29:12.890 --> 29:14.890]  If you make note of that, you can cut two more off next time
[29:14.890 --> 29:16.890]  before that little nub happens.
[29:17.490 --> 29:19.490]  You just cut four days off of your cycle,
[29:19.490 --> 29:21.490]  and the plants are going to be bigger, fatter,
[29:21.490 --> 29:23.490]  and beefier.
[29:23.490 --> 29:25.490]  Now, here's another thing that this benefits.
[29:25.490 --> 29:27.490]  If you are looking to
[29:27.490 --> 29:29.490]  revege your plant,
[29:29.490 --> 29:31.490]  if you did not get a clone of this plant,
[29:31.490 --> 29:33.490]  you can put it on 18-6
[29:33.490 --> 29:35.490]  for the last two weeks of flower,
[29:35.490 --> 29:37.490]  harvest most of the plant when you're done,
[29:37.490 --> 29:39.490]  leave a couple nubs at the bottom,
[29:39.490 --> 29:41.490]  and those are already reveging.
[29:41.490 --> 29:43.490]  They've been in 18-6 for two weeks now.
[29:43.490 --> 29:45.490]  The hormones have already switched over.
[29:46.090 --> 29:48.090]  You're two weeks ahead of yourself on your revege.
[29:48.090 --> 29:50.090]  You just got to wait a little bit of time now.
[29:50.090 --> 29:52.090]  Now that you cut the rest of that plant off,
[29:52.090 --> 29:54.090]  and all the energy is not moving around,
[29:54.090 --> 29:56.090]  the hormones aren't like,
[29:56.090 --> 29:58.090]  I'm in flower up here, I'm in vege over here.
[29:58.090 --> 30:00.090]  The plant's going to say,
[30:00.090 --> 30:02.090]  you took off all my flowers,
[30:02.090 --> 30:04.090]  I've just got these little flowers here to deal with,
[30:04.090 --> 30:06.090]  I got a big root zone,
[30:06.090 --> 30:08.090]  and I'm on 18-6, he wants me to vege.
[30:08.090 --> 30:10.090]  Watch this. Kapow!
[30:10.090 --> 30:12.090]  It will vege really quickly that way on you.
[30:12.090 --> 30:14.090]  Carefully pay attention to your plants.
[30:14.690 --> 30:16.690]  I've got a lot of plants that are going to be
[30:16.690 --> 30:18.690]  in my experience, not my opinion,
[30:18.690 --> 30:20.690]  they will get beefier, fatter, chunkier.
[30:20.690 --> 30:22.690]  You'll have a fatter weight,
[30:22.690 --> 30:24.690]  you'll have more bud,
[30:24.690 --> 30:26.690]  and they'll probably be a little bit more dense.
[30:26.690 --> 30:28.690]  So 18-6 is a good thing toward the end.
[30:28.690 --> 30:30.690]  If you're making seeds,
[30:30.690 --> 30:32.690]  18-6 is good a little bit after pollination.
[30:32.690 --> 30:34.690]  I get a lot of messages about that.
[30:34.690 --> 30:36.690]  I mean it. It's real.
[30:36.690 --> 30:38.690]  It helps you with a lot of things.
[30:38.690 --> 30:40.690]  It also sets you up for that revege.
[30:40.690 --> 30:42.690]  So if you're trying to revege,
[30:43.290 --> 30:45.290]  you can pollinate a room,
[30:45.290 --> 30:47.290]  and then get seeds out of it,
[30:47.290 --> 30:49.290]  and then pull clones off of it,
[30:49.290 --> 30:51.290]  and have a mother plant to grow again.
[30:51.290 --> 30:53.290]  Or you can grow your plants and harvest them.
[30:53.290 --> 30:55.290]  And I said harvest, I got one of those hard H's again.
[30:55.290 --> 30:57.290]  You can harvest the plants,
[30:57.290 --> 30:59.290]  and then you got clones coming up
[30:59.290 --> 31:01.290]  that you can revege, make a mother plant out of.
[31:01.290 --> 31:03.290]  Don't be afraid to experiment, you guys.
[31:03.290 --> 31:05.290]  Don't be afraid to experiment.
[31:05.290 --> 31:07.290]  I do understand these plants are precious.
[31:07.290 --> 31:09.290]  You're learning a lot, you're growing a lot.
[31:09.290 --> 31:11.290]  They may be paying the bills,
[31:11.890 --> 31:13.890]  but you're learning a lot.
[31:13.890 --> 31:15.890]  I do think that this 18-6 idea
[31:15.890 --> 31:17.890]  that I switched to was a really good idea.
[31:17.890 --> 31:19.890]  It's helping me out.
[31:19.890 --> 31:21.890]  Alright, I think that is all I'm going to give you
[31:21.890 --> 31:23.890]  for this episode,
[31:23.890 --> 31:25.890]  because the next email that I've got
[31:25.890 --> 31:27.890]  deserves a lot of time.
[31:27.890 --> 31:29.890]  This is going to be a long one,
[31:29.890 --> 31:31.890]  so that will be the next episode.
[31:31.890 --> 31:33.890]  Shout out to my buddy, Billy Podunk,
[31:33.890 --> 31:35.890]  for all of the great support.
[31:35.890 --> 31:37.890]  It's good being your friend, bro.
[31:37.890 --> 31:39.890]  I'm glad that you are such a great member
[31:40.490 --> 31:42.490]  of the IRE Army Discord.
[31:42.490 --> 31:44.490]  Shout out, bro. I appreciate you.
[31:44.490 --> 31:46.490]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[31:46.490 --> 31:48.490]  hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[31:48.490 --> 31:50.490]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers,
[31:50.490 --> 31:52.490]  12-12ers, 18-6ers,
[31:52.490 --> 31:54.490]  4-20ers, and 7-10ers,
[31:54.490 --> 31:56.490]  I want to thank all of you for listening
[31:56.490 --> 31:58.490]  to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[31:58.490 --> 32:00.490]  650 episodes, dude.
[32:00.490 --> 32:02.490]  Holy shit.
[32:02.490 --> 32:04.490]  I had no idea it was going to go this far.
[32:04.490 --> 32:06.490]  We were chilling at Maddie & Spence's
[32:06.490 --> 32:08.490]  and people kept asking me
[32:09.090 --> 32:11.090]  the same Grow question and I said,
[32:11.090 --> 32:13.090]  I should record this.
[32:13.090 --> 32:15.090]  When people ask me the same damn question,
[32:15.090 --> 32:17.090]  I should just hit play on my phone and let it go.
[32:17.090 --> 32:19.090]  Then I thought, or, you could do a podcast
[32:19.090 --> 32:21.090]  and just help all kinds of people.
[32:21.090 --> 32:23.090]  Since everybody's asking the same question,
[32:23.090 --> 32:25.090]  there's probably a bunch of people out there
[32:25.090 --> 32:27.090]  with that question, too.
[32:27.090 --> 32:29.090]  Started off with a really shitty sounding
[32:29.090 --> 32:31.090]  audio show and now here we are, bro.
[32:31.090 --> 32:33.090]  4K HD, 650 episodes,
[32:33.090 --> 32:35.090]  7,000 YouTube subscribers,
[32:35.090 --> 32:37.090]  225 Patreon supporters.
[32:37.690 --> 32:39.690]  Thank you guys, I really do appreciate it.
[32:39.690 --> 32:41.690]  This is amazing to me that this
[32:41.690 --> 32:43.690]  little idea, stoned idea,
[32:43.690 --> 32:45.690]  ended up being a fucking fruitful,
[32:45.690 --> 32:47.690]  successful business that helps thousands of people.
[32:47.690 --> 32:49.690]  That means a lot to me.
[32:49.690 --> 32:51.690]  Thank you, I do appreciate it.
[32:51.690 --> 32:53.690]  I was rambly today.
[32:53.690 --> 32:55.690]  Shout out to 14er for the papaya cake
[32:55.690 --> 32:57.690]  live rosin. That shit got me going
[32:57.690 --> 32:59.690]  after a little nap.
[32:59.690 --> 33:01.690]  I look forward to all the emails,
[33:01.690 --> 33:03.690]  corrections, comments, concerns,
[33:03.690 --> 33:05.690]  responses to this episode.
[33:06.290 --> 33:08.290]  Don't be shy. Send me some love.
[33:08.290 --> 33:10.290]  Send me some hate. Don't worry about my ego.
[33:10.290 --> 33:12.290]  I'm cool. We can handle this at this point.
[33:12.290 --> 33:14.290]  Also, make sure you check out
[33:14.290 --> 33:16.290]  the website, iRegenetics.com.
[33:16.290 --> 33:18.290]  I talked about the list of trusted vendors.
[33:18.290 --> 33:20.290]  There's a Grow Help tab on there.
[33:20.290 --> 33:22.290]  There's a link to the iRegenetics
[33:22.290 --> 33:24.290]  web store. There's also a spot
[33:24.290 --> 33:26.290]  to sign up for the iRegenetics
[33:26.290 --> 33:28.290]  newsletter. That's right, it says
[33:28.290 --> 33:30.290]  keep in touch or stay up to date.
[33:30.290 --> 33:32.290]  If you type in your email address, it will add you
[33:32.290 --> 33:34.290]  to the mailing list. Approximately once
[33:34.290 --> 33:36.290]  a month, I send out a newsletter.
[33:36.290 --> 33:38.290]  In that newsletter, there are coupon
[33:38.290 --> 33:40.290]  codes to the vendors. There are
[33:40.290 --> 33:42.290]  links to new vendors.
[33:42.290 --> 33:44.290]  There's always a coupon code to
[33:44.290 --> 33:46.290]  my Etsy store. I change the coupon code once
[33:46.290 --> 33:48.290]  a month so that people can't just keep using
[33:48.290 --> 33:50.290]  the same damn coupon code. We'll give you some deals
[33:50.290 --> 33:52.290]  on the Etsy store. Sometimes one
[33:52.290 --> 33:54.290]  item is on sale. Sometimes every item is
[33:54.290 --> 33:56.290]  on sale. You never know what I might do on the
[33:56.290 --> 33:58.290]  Etsy shop. My advice to you
[33:58.290 --> 34:00.290]  is sign up for the newsletter. You can stay up to date.
[34:00.290 --> 34:02.290]  It's on the website
[34:02.290 --> 34:04.290]  iRegenetics.com. Type in your email
[34:04.290 --> 34:06.290]  address. It will send you...it just links
[34:06.290 --> 34:08.290]  it right up for me. Then when I send out the mail chimp,
[34:08.290 --> 34:10.290]  you will get the notification. That was
[34:10.290 --> 34:12.290]  a mouthful to try to say.
[34:12.290 --> 34:14.290]  Also, if you feel like the show is educational, informative
[34:14.290 --> 34:16.290]  or entertaining, maybe you'd like to
[34:16.290 --> 34:18.290]  throw us a couple of bucks because I made you laugh. Maybe
[34:18.290 --> 34:20.290]  I rescued your plants. All you have to do is visit
[34:20.290 --> 34:22.290]  www.patreon.com
[34:22.290 --> 34:24.290]  forward slash grow from
[34:24.290 --> 34:26.290]  your heart. All the information to
[34:26.290 --> 34:28.290]  sign up on the show is right there. All the
[34:28.290 --> 34:30.290]  tiers are listed right there. Again, you guys
[34:30.290 --> 34:32.290]  really thank you for all
[34:32.290 --> 34:34.290]  the Patreon support. At this time, I've got
[34:34.290 --> 34:36.290]  225 patrons.
[34:36.290 --> 34:38.290]  That means the world to me that 225
[34:38.290 --> 34:40.290]  people during these hard
[34:40.290 --> 34:42.290]  times. I sound like an old man when I
[34:42.290 --> 34:44.290]  start talking like this, but money is expensive right
[34:44.290 --> 34:46.290]  now. We are in a pandemic. A lot of people
[34:46.290 --> 34:48.290]  lost their jobs. A lot of people have fucking
[34:48.290 --> 34:50.290]  fucked up situations and people are
[34:50.290 --> 34:52.290]  choosing to spend their hard-earned money on
[34:52.290 --> 34:54.290]  a podcast. Thank you. I really,
[34:54.290 --> 34:56.290]  really do appreciate that. I don't
[34:56.290 --> 34:58.290]  know how else to express it.
[34:58.290 --> 35:00.290]  I'm going to make it
[35:00.290 --> 35:02.290]  worth it for the patrons very soon. I have some
[35:02.290 --> 35:04.290]  tricks up my t-shirt. I'm not wearing
[35:04.290 --> 35:06.290]  any sleeves. I've got some tricks up my t-shirt.
[35:06.290 --> 35:08.290]  You guys are going to enjoy it.
[35:08.290 --> 35:10.290]  I hope. All right. I'm
[35:10.290 --> 35:12.290]  fucking stoned and rambly, so I should wrap
[35:12.290 --> 35:14.290]  up this show. Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for hanging out
[35:14.290 --> 35:16.290]  for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. It means
[35:16.290 --> 35:18.290]  a lot to me. You guys support me. You guys watch my rambles.
[35:18.290 --> 35:20.290]  Super cool of you. Gang, gang.
[35:20.290 --> 35:22.290]  Dabs, dabs. I appreciate you. I'll be
[35:22.290 --> 35:24.290]  back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[35:24.290 --> 35:26.290]  I want to give a big shout out to my buddy
[35:26.290 --> 35:28.290]  Joe Brewer, home grower.
[35:28.290 --> 35:30.290]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[35:30.290 --> 35:32.290]  and give your mom a hug for me.
