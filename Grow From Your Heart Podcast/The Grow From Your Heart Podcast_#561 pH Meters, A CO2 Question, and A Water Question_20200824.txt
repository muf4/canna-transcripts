[00:00.000 --> 00:13.360]  Right here we go.
[00:13.360 --> 00:14.540]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:14.540 --> 00:19.040]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff and it is time for episode 561 of the grow
[00:19.040 --> 00:21.220]  from your heart podcast.

[00:58.200 --> 01:02.160]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking today.
[01:02.160 --> 01:06.440]  I've been taking dabs of hella tight live batter from green dot labs.
[01:06.440 --> 01:10.000]  This is a blend of sex on the beach and peach warrior on the package.
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.920]  The flavor is described as sour and star fruit.
[01:12.920 --> 01:14.200]  I agree with the sour.
[01:14.200 --> 01:16.440]  There's something sour and funky about this.
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.560]  I don't know that I've ever tasted star fruit, so I can't compare that.
[01:20.560 --> 01:23.320]  I do think it tasted like sweet mangoes.
[01:23.320 --> 01:27.400]  So if a star fruit tastes like a sugary mango, that is an accurate description.
[01:27.400 --> 01:28.400]  I'll show this to the camera.
[01:28.400 --> 01:30.440]  You can see the remnants of my gram here.
[01:30.440 --> 01:31.940]  I've smoked the better part of this.
[01:31.940 --> 01:34.840]  This was pretty delicious, quite potent on the back of the package.
[01:34.840 --> 01:42.240]  It says it contains 60.0 or 60.15% THC and non detectable amounts of CBD.
[01:42.240 --> 01:47.400]  Big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the delicious hella tight live batter.
[01:47.400 --> 01:48.560]  All right.
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.760]  In this episode, I'm going to read a few Patreon questions.
[01:51.760 --> 01:55.320]  Before we get there, let's send some thank you shout outs to the folks who support us
[01:55.320 --> 01:56.760]  on Patreon.
[01:56.760 --> 01:59.000]  Let's start off with the big grow from your heart podcast.
[01:59.000 --> 02:00.000]  Thank you.
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.160]  Shout out to girls grow too.
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.560]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Brendan grows.
[02:03.560 --> 02:06.560]  Let's also send a big thank you shout out to grow man, Stan.
[02:06.560 --> 02:09.960]  I've always got a big thank you shout out to my friend Spruce Hill Farm.
[02:09.960 --> 02:12.640]  Let's also send a big thank you shout out to Tonto's garden.
[02:12.640 --> 02:14.920]  I want to send a special thank you to Curt Z.
[02:14.920 --> 02:18.840]  I've always got a big thank you for Roger S. How about a big thank you shout out to David
[02:18.840 --> 02:22.240]  H. Let's also send a big thank you shout out to Papa Z.
[02:22.240 --> 02:25.000]  And how about a big grow from your heart podcast.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  Thank you.
[02:26.000 --> 02:30.360]  Shout out to our friend Zozo J. Big thanks to everybody who continues to support the
[02:30.360 --> 02:31.360]  show.
[02:31.360 --> 02:34.040]  If you're not already supporting the show on Patreon and you'd like to learn how to
[02:34.040 --> 02:40.840]  do so all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[02:40.840 --> 02:43.760]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:43.760 --> 02:47.960]  And of course I did include that link in the show notes to make it nice and easy for all
[02:47.960 --> 02:48.960]  of my friends.
[02:48.960 --> 02:52.640]  All right, I think we have covered all of the business part of the show.
[02:52.640 --> 02:53.900]  Let's not waste too much time.
[02:53.900 --> 02:55.400]  Let's jump into the Patreon questions.
[02:55.400 --> 02:59.240]  Of course, if you've got a question, you can send it to me via Patreon.
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.360]  There's a level on Patreon that you will get your question right to the top of the
[03:02.360 --> 03:03.360]  list.
[03:03.360 --> 03:05.400]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:05.400 --> 03:10.520]  The first Patreon question came from that they sign it, but they want their name said
[03:10.520 --> 03:15.160]  this came from girls grow too and it goes like this.
[03:15.160 --> 03:20.440]  It says Rasta Jeff, can you give me any advice on pH meters and EC meters?
[03:20.440 --> 03:23.320]  The cheap shit on Amazon sucks, obviously.
[03:23.320 --> 03:28.440]  And yet it's hard to find really solid information on equipment that isn't total bullshit.
[03:28.440 --> 03:29.440]  I trust you.
[03:29.440 --> 03:30.680]  Do you have any advice?
[03:30.680 --> 03:34.640]  Are $150 meters worth it?
[03:34.640 --> 03:40.400]  Yeah, unfortunately you get what you pay for when it comes to EC meters and pH pens and
[03:40.400 --> 03:42.280]  all that good stuff.
[03:42.280 --> 03:43.840]  Unfortunately the good shit is expensive.
[03:43.840 --> 03:45.600]  That is scientific equipment.
[03:45.600 --> 03:50.040]  And in most cases when it comes to scientific equipment, the more expensive, the better.
[03:50.040 --> 03:51.960]  I know that's not probably what you wanted to hear.
[03:51.960 --> 03:56.960]  You wanted me to recommend some sort of $40 device that will save the day.
[03:56.960 --> 03:58.480]  Unfortunately I don't have that recommendation.
[03:58.480 --> 04:00.640]  I'm going to screen share some stuff here.
[04:00.640 --> 04:04.400]  If you were watching the video, this is exactly the device that I would recommend.
[04:04.400 --> 04:07.120]  I'm showing a blue lab pH pen.
[04:07.120 --> 04:10.400]  There's a blue lab pH pen for $116.
[04:10.400 --> 04:13.600]  Then there's another combo meter that is $308.
[04:13.600 --> 04:17.920]  That one will measure pH and conductivity and temperature.
[04:17.920 --> 04:22.280]  The conductivity is the EC, the electrical conductivity that measures the amount of nutrient
[04:22.280 --> 04:24.120]  solution in the water.
[04:24.120 --> 04:25.240]  That is the device I use.
[04:25.240 --> 04:26.600]  The blue lab combo meter.
[04:26.640 --> 04:28.560]  It is $308.
[04:28.560 --> 04:31.560]  When you buy that, I also recommend you buy the storage solution.
[04:31.560 --> 04:36.200]  And I also recommend you buy one or two bottles of calibration solution.
[04:36.200 --> 04:38.960]  You'll need a four and a seven and possibly a 10.
[04:38.960 --> 04:40.480]  Do your research before you buy that.
[04:40.480 --> 04:42.200]  Get the appropriate calibration solution.
[04:42.200 --> 04:44.720]  It comes with a little tiny bit, but not enough.
[04:44.720 --> 04:45.720]  I like more.
[04:45.720 --> 04:47.440]  I like to calibrate about once a week.
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.120]  So if you're on a tight budget, you don't need that EC meter and you just want to check
[04:52.120 --> 04:53.120]  the pH.
[04:53.120 --> 04:54.880]  I recommend this blue lab pH pen.
[04:54.880 --> 04:56.040]  It is a good product.
[04:56.040 --> 04:59.920]  If you really want to step it up, go for the blue lab combo meter.
[04:59.920 --> 05:03.240]  Of course they do offer in the middle here, you see the blue lab truncheon meter that
[05:03.240 --> 05:07.360]  is, it says impossibly tough EC meter built to last a lifetime.
[05:07.360 --> 05:08.640]  That is a good product as well.
[05:08.640 --> 05:10.480]  I recommend the blue lab stuff.
[05:10.480 --> 05:11.760]  We're relying on these products.
[05:11.760 --> 05:14.440]  These are like, if you were a carpenter, this is your saw or your hammer.
[05:14.440 --> 05:16.520]  You're going to use this every single day.
[05:16.520 --> 05:18.000]  You want this right there on your tool belt.
[05:18.000 --> 05:19.160]  You're going to need this.
[05:19.160 --> 05:21.440]  Make sure you spend good quality money on it.
[05:21.440 --> 05:22.880]  Don't cheap out on this type of equipment.
[05:22.880 --> 05:24.960]  It's something that, like I said, you're using it every day.
[05:24.960 --> 05:29.280]  Your plants rely on you to have the appropriate pH and EC, so get the good shit.
[05:29.280 --> 05:32.520]  I think I covered you on there.
[05:32.520 --> 05:35.680]  Proper storage is very important when you do get a good pH pen.
[05:35.680 --> 05:37.640]  Make sure it is stored properly.
[05:37.640 --> 05:41.080]  There is a storage solution that they recommend you store your pH meter in.
[05:41.080 --> 05:44.360]  Put some in the cap and then push the meter right into there and they'll leave, you'll
[05:44.360 --> 05:45.680]  leave some of that moisture in the cap.
[05:45.680 --> 05:46.880]  You never want it to get dry.
[05:46.880 --> 05:49.160]  The phrase is, if it dries, it dies.
[05:49.160 --> 05:50.840]  Never let your meters get dry.
[05:50.840 --> 05:51.840]  It's over.
[05:51.840 --> 05:54.800]  Also clean them and calibrate them obsessively.
[05:54.800 --> 05:58.920]  When you do get what you pay for, so like I keep saying, don't cheap out.
[05:58.920 --> 06:01.160]  You're growing kind of an expensive product.
[06:01.160 --> 06:05.080]  If you think about the value of the product in the end, you've got a hundred or 300 bucks
[06:05.080 --> 06:08.920]  to spend on this product, or at least you will after a couple of harvests, or you'll
[06:08.920 --> 06:11.840]  save that much on your dispensary runs.
[06:11.840 --> 06:13.020]  Think about it economically.
[06:13.020 --> 06:16.080]  Think about returning investment into your garden so your garden is better.
[06:16.080 --> 06:18.360]  Yeah, you do got to buy the expensive one.
[06:18.360 --> 06:22.360]  I wish that I had cheaper news for you, but it's expensive to get good shit.
[06:22.680 --> 06:26.680]  Now it says, side note, I've also listened to some of your episodes more than once and
[06:26.680 --> 06:29.960]  sending them off to friends now who are wanting to grow.
[06:29.960 --> 06:30.960]  Thank you.
[06:30.960 --> 06:31.960]  I appreciate that.
[06:31.960 --> 06:33.400]  And it says, and it's thanks to you Rasta Jeff.
[06:33.400 --> 06:34.920]  Man, you're very welcome.
[06:34.920 --> 06:35.920]  Thank you.
[06:35.920 --> 06:37.840]  I appreciate knowing that you're introducing new people to the show.
[06:37.840 --> 06:38.840]  That means a lot to me.
[06:38.840 --> 06:42.200]  That means you trust me enough to tell your other girlfriends like, Hey, listen to this
[06:42.200 --> 06:43.200]  dude.
[06:43.200 --> 06:44.200]  He's teaching me how to grow.
[06:44.200 --> 06:45.200]  He can teach you how to grow.
[06:45.200 --> 06:46.200]  That means a lot.
[06:46.200 --> 06:47.200]  So thank you.
[06:47.200 --> 06:48.200]  Fist bump.
[06:48.200 --> 06:49.200]  You just got a virtual fist bump.
[06:49.200 --> 06:51.400]  It goes on to say you're a solid human with a good big heart.
[06:51.440 --> 06:54.760]  You have a good energy that can be felt through the mic and through the screen.
[06:54.760 --> 06:56.920]  You're my favorite grow podcast by far.
[06:56.920 --> 06:59.120]  Keep it up, my man.
[06:59.120 --> 07:02.760]  From girls grow to.
[07:02.760 --> 07:03.760]  That's a great compliment.
[07:03.760 --> 07:04.760]  So thank you.
[07:04.760 --> 07:07.780]  I love that you could feel the vibes and energy coming through the screen.
[07:07.780 --> 07:09.500]  Sometimes that's not possible.
[07:09.500 --> 07:12.080]  Sometimes people feel plasticky and weird on shows.
[07:12.080 --> 07:14.920]  And sometimes when you meet them, they're not who you met through the screen.
[07:14.920 --> 07:16.360]  This is all I know how to be as me.
[07:16.360 --> 07:18.960]  So I'm glad you're noticing and thank you.
[07:18.960 --> 07:20.240]  And thanks again for the great message.
[07:20.240 --> 07:23.160]  And also thank you for the continued Patreon support.
[07:23.160 --> 07:25.560]  I see your name pop up on Patreon every month.
[07:25.560 --> 07:26.680]  You have a lot of great questions.
[07:26.680 --> 07:27.680]  You participate.
[07:27.680 --> 07:28.940]  I see you on social media.
[07:28.940 --> 07:29.940]  That means a lot to me.
[07:29.940 --> 07:30.940]  Thank you.
[07:30.940 --> 07:31.940]  Part of the Irie army forever.
[07:31.940 --> 07:32.940]  Gang gang.
[07:32.940 --> 07:33.940]  I appreciate you.
[07:33.940 --> 07:34.940]  Thank you.
[07:34.940 --> 07:38.320]  I'm putting a big check mark on your message there because I've done read that on the show.
[07:38.320 --> 07:39.680]  I wish I had cheaper advice for you.
[07:39.680 --> 07:43.320]  I wish I could recommend a cheap piece of gear, but cheap gear, why cheap out?
[07:43.320 --> 07:46.680]  You get cheap shit just like musical instruments, just like most stuff in life.
[07:46.680 --> 07:48.880]  You could buy the cheap shit if you want, but it's cheap shit.
[07:49.120 --> 07:51.320]  If you want to buy it once, go buy a good one.
[07:51.320 --> 07:55.160]  I think they say the cheap hammer is the most expensive tool you'll ever buy.
[07:55.160 --> 07:56.160]  You got to buy six hammers.
[07:56.160 --> 07:57.160]  You're going to break it every week.
[07:57.160 --> 07:58.160]  You got to go buy a new one.
[07:58.160 --> 08:01.480]  Uh, the guy that bought the $40 hammer on Monday, he didn't break it.
[08:01.480 --> 08:03.320]  You spent 10 bucks five days a week.
[08:03.320 --> 08:04.320]  He bought five hammers.
[08:04.320 --> 08:05.400]  You spent 50 bucks.
[08:05.400 --> 08:06.400]  You cheaped out.
[08:06.400 --> 08:07.400]  He didn't win.
[08:07.400 --> 08:08.480]  All right, I'll quit rambling.
[08:08.480 --> 08:09.480]  We'll get focused.
[08:09.480 --> 08:12.240]  The next message comes from North North Terps.
[08:12.240 --> 08:13.240]  What up North?
[08:13.240 --> 08:14.240]  You're getting popular.
[08:14.240 --> 08:15.760]  I heard your name on the DGC also.
[08:15.760 --> 08:19.440]  Thank you for supporting the cannabis community and cannabis podcasters.
[08:19.440 --> 08:20.680]  I appreciate it.
[08:20.680 --> 08:24.400]  And I'm sure that the dude and everybody, Scotty real, everybody at the dude grow show
[08:24.400 --> 08:27.960]  appreciates your support for the community as well.
[08:27.960 --> 08:30.200]  When I printed this message, it's funny.
[08:30.200 --> 08:34.160]  It printed the Patreon box and it printed your name, but it didn't print the full question.
[08:34.160 --> 08:37.800]  I remember that you did ask, you said you wanted to breed with Scarlet begonias.
[08:37.800 --> 08:43.320]  Is there a specific phenotype of Scarlet begonias, which I would recommend for breeding with?
[08:43.320 --> 08:44.920]  Um, yes.
[08:45.080 --> 08:47.840]  There is a, a big bushy phenotype.
[08:47.840 --> 08:50.080]  It's very fast growing.
[08:50.080 --> 08:52.160]  It's kind of like a bushy tree.
[08:52.160 --> 08:53.160]  It's fast growing.
[08:53.160 --> 08:56.520]  It takes a little bit longer to finish than most of the phenotypes.
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.040]  It's a longer finishing phenotype.
[08:58.040 --> 09:01.220]  I know that's probably not your favorite thing to hear when it comes to breeding.
[09:01.220 --> 09:03.040]  Everybody wants the fast finishers.
[09:03.040 --> 09:04.440]  I like longer flowering times.
[09:04.440 --> 09:08.680]  I think longer flowering times gives you bigger plants, more potency, more vigor.
[09:08.680 --> 09:09.840]  The longer flowering plants.
[09:09.840 --> 09:11.000]  I like their high better.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.360]  They give me a better head buzz.
[09:12.360 --> 09:13.360]  That's what I'm looking for.
[09:13.360 --> 09:14.680]  So that's what I breed toward.
[09:15.440 --> 09:17.760]  I would find the one that grows like a big tree.
[09:17.760 --> 09:19.000]  It's a long finisher.
[09:19.000 --> 09:21.560]  It's got long skinny jacket leaves.
[09:21.560 --> 09:23.420]  It's almost like a haze plant.
[09:23.420 --> 09:25.680]  That plant makes long tall colas.
[09:25.680 --> 09:28.680]  The whole plant is just long tall colas.
[09:28.680 --> 09:33.720]  Also the trichomes are really, um, they're not, some plants make short trichomes.
[09:33.720 --> 09:35.280]  These trichomes are really tall as well.
[09:35.280 --> 09:37.040]  They'll stick up off the plants quite far.
[09:37.040 --> 09:39.840]  If you scope them, you'd be like, those are tall trichomes.
[09:39.840 --> 09:41.880]  I like that phenotype.
[09:41.880 --> 09:46.400]  Also this one, the phenotype I'm talking about, if you've grown it a few times, you'll notice
[09:46.400 --> 09:50.260]  that at the end of the flowering phase, no matter what you do, it just goes hard yellow
[09:50.260 --> 09:51.260]  on you.
[09:51.260 --> 09:52.360]  It's like, no, you can feed me.
[09:52.360 --> 09:53.440]  You can foliar feed me.
[09:53.440 --> 09:54.440]  You can top dress me.
[09:54.440 --> 09:57.800]  You can do whatever you want, but yellow, I don't give a shit.
[09:57.800 --> 09:59.360]  That is the plant that I love.
[09:59.360 --> 10:01.360]  It's very haze dominant.
[10:01.360 --> 10:04.520]  It's got a lot of the haze from the redheaded stranger cross in there.
[10:04.520 --> 10:05.600]  It's got a lot of haze.
[10:05.600 --> 10:07.500]  Maybe it's a lot of golden goat coming through in there.
[10:07.500 --> 10:09.520]  Maybe it's the Island sweet skunk.
[10:09.640 --> 10:14.760]  It's got a really sativa dominant structure, leaf shape, and a buzz.
[10:14.760 --> 10:18.840]  Something that is noticeable is it is very spicy in flavor.
[10:18.840 --> 10:22.160]  It's almost like a spicy sour apple sucker.
[10:22.160 --> 10:26.960]  If you had a sour apple sucker and maybe dunked it in jalapeno juice, I know that sounds really
[10:26.960 --> 10:31.200]  weird, but if you go get a sour apple sucker, you'll notice there's a spiciness to it.
[10:31.200 --> 10:35.240]  That is almost sour apples with a jalapeno juice on it.
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.240]  Sounds crazy.
[10:36.240 --> 10:37.240]  I fucking love it.
[10:37.960 --> 10:42.960]  It gets me so high that I'm almost, I sit still, but I'm super high.
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.240]  It's because my brain is jogging, running laps around me, but my body is so stoned that
[10:47.240 --> 10:50.640]  I can't, there's no need to move anywhere.
[10:50.640 --> 10:52.200]  That's the phenotype I would recommend.
[10:52.200 --> 10:55.920]  Breed to her and you will get, that one will put, I think you were going to breed it to
[10:55.920 --> 10:56.920]  a rise.
[10:56.920 --> 10:59.880]  I'm not sure what your goal to breed it to was because I didn't print the entire message.
[10:59.880 --> 11:00.880]  I apologize for that.
[11:00.880 --> 11:06.280]  That's poor podcasting, but breed it to that one and you will find that you get an insane,
[11:06.320 --> 11:07.920]  insane head buzz.
[11:07.920 --> 11:09.080]  It will make your eyes vibrate.
[11:09.080 --> 11:10.860]  It'll make your body vibrate.
[11:10.860 --> 11:13.040]  Like I said, your brain will be running laps inside your head.
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.560]  The fish, the little fish in your fish bowl will be swimming laps, bumping into the wall
[11:16.560 --> 11:20.340]  and shit, but your body will just be stuck and you won't want to do anything except sit
[11:20.340 --> 11:22.480]  there and try to contemplate life.
[11:22.480 --> 11:25.220]  Maybe pick the lint out of your belly button or something that's as exciting as you're
[11:25.220 --> 11:26.220]  going to get.
[11:26.220 --> 11:28.960]  So that's the female phenotype that I would use.
[11:28.960 --> 11:30.000]  There's a male phenotype.
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.840]  If you're going to breed with a male, don't get the one that is crazy tall.
[11:34.840 --> 11:38.240]  The crazy tall, tall male is just going to make crazy tall plants.
[11:38.240 --> 11:39.540]  They get even taller.
[11:39.540 --> 11:42.360]  The offspring outgrow the tall Scarlet begonias male.
[11:42.360 --> 11:43.360]  So don't do that.
[11:43.360 --> 11:44.360]  I don't recommend that.
[11:44.360 --> 11:46.760]  If you're going to use the male, find one that's medium in height.
[11:46.760 --> 11:49.840]  You don't want a super tall one because it puts off tall traits.
[11:49.840 --> 11:50.840]  Do a stem rub.
[11:50.840 --> 11:53.840]  Look for the one that's got sour apples and puke in the stem rub if you're going to use
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.200]  the male.
[11:55.200 --> 11:58.560]  That's as far as I can give you advice on that.
[11:58.560 --> 12:00.600]  You've only got so many phenotypes to pick through.
[12:00.600 --> 12:03.600]  However many seeds you've got, you got a couple of males to choose from.
[12:03.600 --> 12:06.400]  You don't want the earliest male to show you that it's a male.
[12:06.400 --> 12:07.600]  I've talked about this before.
[12:07.600 --> 12:09.080]  That's going to be too dominant in the cross.
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.720]  You want, if you've got five males, usually that second, third and fourth one are the
[12:12.720 --> 12:14.160]  ones you want to choose from.
[12:14.160 --> 12:15.760]  The first one, too dominant.
[12:15.760 --> 12:17.360]  The last one kind of weak.
[12:17.360 --> 12:19.200]  Those three in the middle are your selectors.
[12:19.200 --> 12:24.880]  Then base that on vigor, leaf shape, plant shape, aroma, stem rub.
[12:24.880 --> 12:26.320]  Did one of them get powdery mildew?
[12:26.320 --> 12:28.400]  Does one of them have spider mites and the other one doesn't?
[12:28.400 --> 12:30.560]  Use the one that doesn't have problems.
[12:30.560 --> 12:31.560]  Those are resistant.
[12:31.560 --> 12:35.440]  I'm not showing you that it's got resistance and we want to pass on resistance.
[12:35.440 --> 12:36.600]  Think about your breeding project.
[12:36.600 --> 12:37.600]  Think about your goal.
[12:37.600 --> 12:39.440]  Make sure you're not just breeding for Instagram hype.
[12:39.440 --> 12:42.000]  Make sure you've got some, I know who you are, but I know you've got a good goal.
[12:42.000 --> 12:43.760]  I'm just speaking in general.
[12:43.760 --> 12:46.480]  Breed with intention, breed with purpose, and I think you'll be all right.
[12:46.480 --> 12:48.120]  Good luck with your Scarlet Begonias breeding.
[12:48.120 --> 12:49.600]  I would love to see pictures.
[12:49.600 --> 12:52.240]  Also, I'd love a 10 pack of those seeds, bro.
[12:52.240 --> 12:55.280]  I'd probably grow those out and send you some gnarly photos of those.
[12:55.280 --> 12:57.120]  Maybe back cross it, maybe F2 it.
[12:57.120 --> 13:00.200]  You never know what a breeder like me would do with some shit like that.
[13:00.600 --> 13:01.200]  All right.
[13:01.200 --> 13:02.800]  Big shout out to my good friend, North North Terps.
[13:02.800 --> 13:04.440]  I see your name pop up quite a bit.
[13:04.440 --> 13:08.040]  I do appreciate all of the love and support that you show to the cannabis community and
[13:08.040 --> 13:09.760]  to cannabis podcasters.
[13:09.760 --> 13:12.960]  We do need people like you on our side, on our team, keeping us going.
[13:12.960 --> 13:13.960]  So thank you.
[13:13.960 --> 13:15.760]  Big virtual digital fist bump.
[13:15.760 --> 13:17.840]  I'll quit doing that because it fucks up the light every time.
[13:17.840 --> 13:18.840]  All right.
[13:18.840 --> 13:20.720]  I've got another message here in front of me.
[13:20.720 --> 13:24.000]  This one came from, do they want their name said?
[13:24.000 --> 13:25.240]  I don't even know how to say their name.
[13:25.240 --> 13:27.760]  It's got a Y and a P, a V.
[13:27.760 --> 13:29.400]  That's a lot to talk about.
[13:29.400 --> 13:30.400]  Let's keep moving.
[13:30.400 --> 13:34.320]  It goes, hey man, thanks for entertaining us, educating us and providing us with dank
[13:34.320 --> 13:36.120]  ass genetics.
[13:36.120 --> 13:38.280]  Thank you for noticing my passions.
[13:38.280 --> 13:40.160]  I love entertaining.
[13:40.160 --> 13:42.800]  I don't mean to come on here and be a wise ass and be goofy.
[13:42.800 --> 13:44.560]  That's just how I am and it comes out.
[13:44.560 --> 13:45.560]  Thank you.
[13:45.560 --> 13:46.560]  I'm glad you guys noticed that.
[13:46.560 --> 13:48.440]  Education was what I'm here for.
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.080]  Wanted to dispel all the silly myths around cannabis and then providing you with dank
[13:53.080 --> 13:54.080]  ass genetics.
[13:54.080 --> 13:55.280]  That is my passion.
[13:55.280 --> 13:56.280]  I just love breeding.
[13:56.280 --> 13:57.280]  I can't stop doing it.
[13:57.280 --> 13:58.280]  So you're welcome.
[13:58.720 --> 14:02.600]  Because I've said this before, without somebody on the other end of this relationship, I'm
[14:02.600 --> 14:03.760]  just a psychopath.
[14:03.760 --> 14:04.760]  So thank you.
[14:04.760 --> 14:05.800]  Now we're going to keep going.
[14:05.800 --> 14:10.000]  It says between all the breeding, live chats, podcasts and consulting, you've got to be
[14:10.000 --> 14:12.240]  the busiest guy in cannabis.
[14:12.240 --> 14:14.400]  Yeah, but I do take breaks.
[14:14.400 --> 14:17.960]  When I decide that it is time to take a break, there's a day or three where we just chill
[14:17.960 --> 14:19.280]  out and have a good time.
[14:19.280 --> 14:21.360]  But thank you for noticing that I'm staying busy.
[14:21.360 --> 14:22.920]  I do a lot of breeding.
[14:22.920 --> 14:23.920]  That's daily work.
[14:23.920 --> 14:25.640]  Taking care of the plants is daily work.
[14:25.640 --> 14:26.640]  Live chats.
[14:26.640 --> 14:27.640]  I do a live chat every Monday.
[14:27.760 --> 14:30.560]  I'm on Embracing Organics every Thursday.
[14:30.560 --> 14:32.280]  And then today was a Saturday afternoon.
[14:32.280 --> 14:35.640]  I did the Operation Grow Show at 2.
[14:35.640 --> 14:39.160]  I did a Cannabis Live panel where I talked about breeding at 3.
[14:39.160 --> 14:41.800]  And now it's late in the evening and I'm doing my own show.
[14:41.800 --> 14:45.880]  So I do stay pretty busy with live chats and podcasting and then consulting.
[14:45.880 --> 14:47.480]  That's like a once or twice a week thing.
[14:47.480 --> 14:49.080]  Sometimes I'm out of town for that.
[14:49.080 --> 14:50.080]  You're right, bro.
[14:50.080 --> 14:51.080]  I am super busy.
[14:51.080 --> 14:53.440]  Put some miles on the car, put a lot of miles on my throat.
[14:53.440 --> 14:54.440]  Thank you for noticing.
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.600]  It says, I appreciate all of your time and effort and the quality you bring to everything
[14:58.600 --> 14:59.600]  you do.
[14:59.600 --> 15:01.200]  That means a lot to me.
[15:01.200 --> 15:04.680]  I do make sure that everything I do is at least a solid nine.
[15:04.680 --> 15:07.000]  I try to make it a 10, but you know, we're fucking humans.
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  We fuck up.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.240]  We get to nine a lot of the times.
[15:09.240 --> 15:11.600]  I try to make everything fucking solid.
[15:11.600 --> 15:12.600]  So thank you for noticing.
[15:12.600 --> 15:17.080]  It goes on to say, I've got a question regarding CO2 enrichment.
[15:17.080 --> 15:23.320]  I ran a CO2 grow or I ran CO2 last grow and pulled significantly more weight, but I've
[15:23.320 --> 15:27.840]  got nothing to compare to it since it was the first time I ran those genetics.
[15:27.840 --> 15:30.680]  That's really good that you realized there's not a valid test in there.
[15:30.680 --> 15:35.080]  A lot of people would have jumped to the conclusion that it was the CO2, but you've got new genetics.
[15:35.080 --> 15:36.080]  Maybe those are hot fire.
[15:36.080 --> 15:38.360]  Maybe they came from seed and they had seed vigor.
[15:38.360 --> 15:41.000]  Thank you for being, uh, having thought on that.
[15:41.000 --> 15:45.720]  It goes on to say, I also ran at 800 PPM because I was not confident I would be able to keep
[15:45.720 --> 15:50.160]  the plants up with 1600 PPM of CO2.
[15:50.160 --> 15:54.240]  That is a lot of CO2 to try to maintain for eight or nine weeks of flower, especially
[15:54.240 --> 15:55.840]  if you want to add veg in there.
[15:55.840 --> 15:56.840]  So that was a good idea.
[15:56.840 --> 15:58.140]  You did increase CO2.
[15:58.140 --> 16:00.140]  You did augment it a little.
[16:00.140 --> 16:05.080]  Natural CO2 is probably somewhere between four and 450 PPMs of CO2, depending on where
[16:05.080 --> 16:06.080]  you are.
[16:06.080 --> 16:10.880]  So you were increasing and giving those plants a little extra, but it says, my question is
[16:10.880 --> 16:15.480]  in your experience, what does elevated CO2 bring to the grow?
[16:15.480 --> 16:17.520]  The first thing is another expense.
[16:17.520 --> 16:20.480]  That's the first thing you're going to notice because before you see any return on your
[16:20.480 --> 16:23.520]  investment, you are paying out of pocket for equipment.
[16:23.520 --> 16:29.840]  You need a CO2, either a generator or a tank and a regulator, and then you need tubing
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.060]  and you need a monitor.
[16:31.060 --> 16:35.140]  So the first thing you're going to notice that it brings to the grow is another expense.
[16:35.140 --> 16:38.280]  The next thing you'll notice is it brings another trip to the store.
[16:38.280 --> 16:41.440]  You've got to refill that CO2 canister somehow.
[16:41.440 --> 16:42.480]  You got to drag that.
[16:42.480 --> 16:43.480]  You got the tall ones.
[16:43.480 --> 16:44.480]  You got the short ones.
[16:44.480 --> 16:45.480]  You got to get them out of the grow space.
[16:45.480 --> 16:48.080]  If it's at your house, that could be a problem.
[16:48.080 --> 16:49.080]  So think about that.
[16:49.080 --> 16:53.440]  That's another thing that comes with CO2 is more equipment and another expense.
[16:53.440 --> 16:56.520]  But now let's talk about the return on your investment.
[16:56.520 --> 17:04.400]  What comes with the CO2 is more vigor, more size, more growth, possibly a week less veg
[17:04.400 --> 17:05.400]  time.
[17:05.400 --> 17:09.280]  If you're running CO2 and veg, they're going to get that much larger, that much more quickly.
[17:09.280 --> 17:13.800]  So you may be able to cut down your veg time by a whole entire week.
[17:13.800 --> 17:18.680]  Another thing you're going to see is a faster metabolism, which means you can feed the plants
[17:18.680 --> 17:22.640]  more, which means they eat more, which means they grow bigger and faster, which hopefully
[17:22.640 --> 17:25.240]  means you're getting bigger, better buds at the end.
[17:25.240 --> 17:30.440]  So the overall thing that you're going to see with CO2, if you do it right, is a bigger
[17:30.440 --> 17:31.440]  harvest.
[17:31.440 --> 17:32.440]  You're going to have bigger, fatter buds.
[17:32.440 --> 17:33.440]  You're going to have more vigorous plants.
[17:33.440 --> 17:36.200]  You're going to have healthier plants that eat more and they're going to be able to take
[17:36.200 --> 17:37.520]  a little bit higher temperature.
[17:37.520 --> 17:39.580]  They'll be able to take stress a little bit better.
[17:39.580 --> 17:42.360]  And at the end, you're going to get big, fat, juicy, more potent buds.
[17:42.360 --> 17:44.760]  I don't know about more potent, but bigger and fatter buds.
[17:44.760 --> 17:45.920]  Excuse the more potent part.
[17:45.920 --> 17:48.760]  I tried to sound like a salesman, over-talked myself.
[17:48.760 --> 17:53.320]  Now it goes on to say, are both quality and quantity increased?
[17:53.320 --> 17:56.980]  And what are some best practices regarding feeding temperature and light levels when
[17:56.980 --> 17:59.880]  running moderate to high levels of CO2?
[17:59.880 --> 18:02.680]  Great follow-up question.
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.160]  Quantity will be increased if you do it correctly.
[18:05.160 --> 18:07.800]  I cannot guarantee that quality will be increased.
[18:07.800 --> 18:09.880]  This is another thing that will turbocharge the plants.
[18:09.880 --> 18:14.880]  It may push them to the next level, but it may not increase potency, but it will increase
[18:14.880 --> 18:15.880]  the size of the plants.
[18:15.880 --> 18:17.720]  You'll have more of it there.
[18:17.720 --> 18:22.720]  So I can't guarantee an increase in quality, but I can almost promise an increase in quantity.
[18:22.720 --> 18:26.880]  It says, what are some of the best practices regarding feeding?
[18:26.880 --> 18:29.080]  You're going to keep an eye on the plants.
[18:29.080 --> 18:31.360]  Best practices is always keep an eye on the plants.
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.640]  Let the plants be the fucking boss, but you may be able to increase feeding because now
[18:35.640 --> 18:37.480]  they're metabolizing a little better.
[18:37.480 --> 18:39.320]  You just gave them a little bit of a turbo.
[18:39.320 --> 18:40.560]  Now they could take more.
[18:40.560 --> 18:42.080]  You put a turbocharger on the engine.
[18:42.080 --> 18:43.080]  Now they could take more gas.
[18:43.080 --> 18:44.400]  They could burn more rubber.
[18:44.400 --> 18:46.760]  They might want to eat just a little bit more.
[18:46.760 --> 18:47.760]  You're making them work out.
[18:47.760 --> 18:48.760]  They're going to need more food.
[18:48.760 --> 18:52.720]  It's like you're exercising them more, feed them more.
[18:52.720 --> 18:55.920]  Regarding temperature, you may be able to get them a little bit more warm.
[18:55.920 --> 18:59.760]  I'm not going to promise, but now they may tolerate a little bit higher temperatures
[18:59.760 --> 19:02.120]  with more CO2 in there.
[19:02.120 --> 19:04.120]  Light levels.
[19:04.120 --> 19:06.240]  Always run the most light you can put in there.
[19:06.480 --> 19:10.360]  You can go ridiculous, but always try to have the most lights you can put in there.
[19:10.360 --> 19:12.800]  I'm sure that you're not running ridiculous amounts of light.
[19:12.800 --> 19:13.960]  I would know about that by now.
[19:13.960 --> 19:15.760]  You would have included that in your description.
[19:15.760 --> 19:18.520]  If you've got a thousand watt light, turn it up to a thousand.
[19:18.520 --> 19:20.720]  If you've got LEDs, crank them up.
[19:20.720 --> 19:25.840]  I always say run that light as high as you can for your space and for your allowance.
[19:25.840 --> 19:30.680]  Do your thing, but more light, more light, and then more light.
[19:30.680 --> 19:32.920]  Moderate to high levels of CO2.
[19:32.920 --> 19:35.320]  What do you consider moderate to high levels of CO2?
[19:35.320 --> 19:36.680]  800 is a good start.
[19:36.680 --> 19:37.960]  You can get up to 1600.
[19:37.960 --> 19:40.240]  That's a good range to get into.
[19:40.240 --> 19:43.040]  You'll notice that the higher you go, the more they may eat.
[19:43.040 --> 19:44.720]  They may start speeding up on you.
[19:44.720 --> 19:49.920]  One thing I'm going to mention is once you start feeding them a high level of CO2, don't stop.
[19:49.920 --> 19:53.920]  If you, like you said before, you weren't confident you can keep it at 1600,
[19:53.920 --> 19:56.200]  get to a level you're confident at which you can keep it,
[19:56.200 --> 19:57.600]  and then don't back off from there.
[19:57.600 --> 19:59.160]  Stay there.
[19:59.160 --> 20:02.440]  Run your CO2 during the lights, but not during the dark cycle.
[20:02.440 --> 20:03.960]  We don't need CO2 during the dark.
[20:03.960 --> 20:05.760]  They're putting out their own CO2.
[20:05.760 --> 20:09.760]  If you've got a veg area, pump that air from the veg area into your flower area
[20:09.760 --> 20:11.800]  while it's sleeping, and you'll move that CO2.
[20:11.800 --> 20:15.440]  If the lights are on in your flower area, they can take advantage of that CO2,
[20:15.440 --> 20:20.120]  but run them, run the CO2 during the light cycle, not during the dark cycle.
[20:20.120 --> 20:23.000]  Another thing is smart venting.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.400]  CO2 is heavier than oxygen, so it's going to fall to the bottom,
[20:26.400 --> 20:29.640]  but if you've got a big carbon filter, and you've got a bunch of air moving,
[20:29.640 --> 20:33.880]  and you're exhausting the room, getting heat out of the room, getting humidity out,
[20:33.880 --> 20:36.000]  you may also be venting out your CO2.
[20:36.000 --> 20:37.880]  So think about your venting.
[20:37.880 --> 20:40.080]  Think about where the CO2 is going to go.
[20:40.080 --> 20:43.000]  A lot of times I've seen guys do it a couple of ways.
[20:43.000 --> 20:45.600]  You get some dry ice and a bucket of water, and you put that in there,
[20:45.600 --> 20:46.800]  and you can see where the air goes.
[20:46.800 --> 20:49.440]  The dry ice will make smoke, and you can see where it goes.
[20:49.440 --> 20:53.000]  Or if you're me, take a fat dab in the room and let it out real slow.
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.320]  Don't blow it, because it'll go that way.
[20:54.320 --> 20:55.440]  Just let it out.
[20:55.440 --> 20:57.320]  Just let your dab out kind of just out of your lungs.
[20:57.320 --> 20:59.480]  You can see where the air flows into your room.
[20:59.480 --> 21:01.640]  Is the shit getting sucked right out of the vent?
[21:01.680 --> 21:03.400]  You have some opportunity for airflow in the room.
[21:03.400 --> 21:04.560]  Adjust some fans.
[21:04.560 --> 21:06.000]  See where the air is flowing.
[21:06.000 --> 21:09.160]  CO2 is slightly heavier than oxygen, so it will fall.
[21:09.160 --> 21:13.080]  So put a fan blowing it back up if you want it to come back up to canopy level.
[21:13.080 --> 21:15.720]  Also, a fan facing up will deter insects.
[21:15.720 --> 21:17.000]  Bugs want to land on the leaves.
[21:17.000 --> 21:18.960]  If you've got a fan going up, they can't land.
[21:18.960 --> 21:19.880]  They get annoyed.
[21:19.880 --> 21:21.440]  They find somewhere else to fucking land.
[21:21.440 --> 21:23.960]  So keep the air moving if you've got CO2.
[21:23.960 --> 21:25.120]  Think about your exhaust.
[21:25.120 --> 21:26.720]  Don't let it get out of the room.
[21:26.720 --> 21:28.080]  I think those are the main things.
[21:28.080 --> 21:28.960]  And don't let the CO...
[21:28.960 --> 21:31.760]  Once you've started giving it CO2, don't stop giving it CO2.
[21:31.760 --> 21:32.840]  There might be something about dreads.
[21:32.840 --> 21:33.280]  What is that?
[21:33.280 --> 21:34.120]  Nope, just a shadow.
[21:34.120 --> 21:34.840]  We're good.
[21:34.840 --> 21:36.240]  All right.
[21:36.240 --> 21:37.040]  We're going to keep moving.
[21:37.040 --> 21:40.720]  It says, I have the ability to dial in my environment perfectly,
[21:40.720 --> 21:43.120]  and I also have a PAR meter to adjust my lighting
[21:43.120 --> 21:48.880]  and can maintain over 1,000 ppfd evenly if needed.
[21:48.880 --> 21:50.520]  Pay attention to the plants there.
[21:50.520 --> 21:52.480]  See if they start acting like they're angry.
[21:52.480 --> 21:54.560]  Give them as much light as you think they'll take,
[21:54.560 --> 21:55.440]  and then pay attention.
[21:55.440 --> 21:57.280]  If they start drooping, if they start curling,
[21:57.280 --> 21:59.200]  if they show you they're angry, they're angry.
[21:59.200 --> 21:59.840]  Pay attention.
[21:59.840 --> 22:02.680]  The plants are the boss.
[22:02.680 --> 22:05.080]  And what kind of room do you have that you can dial in perfectly
[22:05.080 --> 22:08.080]  and get 1,000 ppfd evenly?
[22:08.080 --> 22:09.640]  Bro, good job building that room.
[22:09.640 --> 22:11.160]  Excellent work there.
[22:11.160 --> 22:13.800]  So let the plants decide if they're getting enough light or too much light.
[22:13.800 --> 22:14.680]  Pay attention.
[22:14.680 --> 22:16.520]  By now, you should be able to tell what they're looking like
[22:16.520 --> 22:17.920]  when they've got enough light.
[22:17.920 --> 22:20.520]  Then it goes on to say, thank you for everything you do,
[22:20.520 --> 22:24.360]  and may the only corona in your life have a lime in it.
[22:24.360 --> 22:26.120]  That's a great fucking catchphrase.
[22:26.120 --> 22:26.960]  I love that.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.000]  I do not drink, but I will have a kombucha with a lime in it.
[22:30.000 --> 22:30.920]  I've got some tea over here.
[22:30.920 --> 22:33.240]  Maybe we'll drop a lime in that for you.
[22:33.240 --> 22:35.120]  Then he sent me a link to some music.
[22:35.120 --> 22:36.400]  A local Detroit rapper.
[22:36.400 --> 22:37.960]  Hopefully he puts a smile on my face.
[22:37.960 --> 22:39.360]  We'll have to check that out.
[22:39.360 --> 22:42.200]  Big shout out to my friend Stone Troutbum for the great message.
[22:42.200 --> 22:42.640]  Thank you, bro.
[22:42.640 --> 22:43.920]  I do appreciate that.
[22:43.920 --> 22:46.520]  I hope I answered your CO2 questions.
[22:46.520 --> 22:48.920]  I know you're a smart guy, so you should be able to make
[22:48.920 --> 22:50.840]  use of the info I gave you.
[22:50.840 --> 22:53.080]  If anybody else out there has a question, of course,
[22:53.080 --> 22:55.040]  patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart,
[22:55.040 --> 22:59.760]  or this one came from growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[22:59.760 --> 23:01.520]  All right, I want to read one more question.
[23:01.520 --> 23:03.480]  I think that'll be enough for this episode.
[23:03.480 --> 23:06.040]  Trying to get these pages unstuck because I've got concentrates
[23:06.040 --> 23:08.160]  on the table and now everything is sticky.
[23:08.160 --> 23:09.600]  You've heard this story before.
[23:09.600 --> 23:10.280]  This one goes on.
[23:10.280 --> 23:12.560]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[23:12.560 --> 23:13.960]  And then it says his Instagram name.
[23:13.960 --> 23:18.040]  I go by greenthumbkels on Instagram.
[23:18.040 --> 23:19.160]  It's cool to use my name.
[23:19.160 --> 23:21.480]  You guys give greenthumbkels a follow.
[23:21.480 --> 23:25.160]  It says, I just want to know your rec for a water schedule.
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.920]  I have one res, one pump, and two tents on a 12-hour schedule,
[23:29.920 --> 23:35.240]  one at 7 AM to 7 PM, and the other at 7 PM to 7 AM.
[23:35.240 --> 23:37.800]  I have to water all of my plants at once.
[23:37.800 --> 23:41.400]  When should I set watering for both to get maximum efficiency?
[23:41.400 --> 23:42.600]  Thanks and grow on.
[23:42.600 --> 23:45.920]  I'll be listening as I always do.
[23:45.920 --> 23:47.240]  Yeah, that's a struggle.
[23:47.240 --> 23:49.800]  Not everybody has access to their grow space.
[23:49.800 --> 23:51.440]  Not everybody has perfect conditions.
[23:51.440 --> 23:54.720]  It sounds like our friend has one opportunity per day to water,
[23:54.720 --> 23:57.840]  but they are running two tents on opposite cycles.
[23:57.840 --> 23:59.000]  That is a very good idea.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.720]  I have done this in one room before.
[24:00.720 --> 24:03.480]  I've got a room that fits two 5 by 5 tents perfectly.
[24:03.480 --> 24:05.000]  It's a spare bedroom.
[24:05.000 --> 24:06.800]  I cannot upgrade the electricity in there,
[24:06.800 --> 24:08.280]  so I can't run both tents at once.
[24:08.280 --> 24:10.280]  It also gets too hot in there.
[24:10.280 --> 24:12.840]  So I've decided to run one.
[24:12.840 --> 24:14.000]  That's harder than it sounds.
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.560]  Run one from 9 AM to 9 PM.
[24:16.560 --> 24:18.640]  The other runs from 9 PM to 9 AM.
[24:18.640 --> 24:20.560]  So I've always got a light on in that room.
[24:20.560 --> 24:23.440]  I'm using that electricity to its maximum efficiency
[24:23.440 --> 24:26.280]  while not blowing anything out and having to do any upgrades.
[24:26.280 --> 24:27.280]  That was a great tent.
[24:27.280 --> 24:28.200]  That worked really well.
[24:28.200 --> 24:29.320]  That was a good cycle.
[24:29.320 --> 24:30.400]  That lasted a long time.
[24:30.400 --> 24:31.920]  That was very productive.
[24:31.920 --> 24:34.880]  Should go back to doing that one day, but it's too hot in that room.
[24:34.880 --> 24:36.920]  So I know I feel your pain.
[24:36.920 --> 24:38.960]  You've got one opportunity to get in there and water.
[24:38.960 --> 24:41.960]  We can't disrupt the dark cycle of the tent that's asleep,
[24:41.960 --> 24:44.240]  but we've got to water the tent that's awake.
[24:44.240 --> 24:49.840]  If you're in there doing it, I would say the time to do it is 645 to 715.
[24:49.880 --> 24:52.200]  That way you're in there 15 minutes before one goes off.
[24:52.200 --> 24:54.240]  You're watering it right as the light goes off.
[24:54.240 --> 24:55.280]  You zip your tent.
[24:55.280 --> 24:56.720]  Good night, sweet dreams.
[24:56.720 --> 24:59.280]  We would rather water in the morning right at the start of the day,
[24:59.280 --> 25:01.120]  but we don't have that opportunity.
[25:01.120 --> 25:03.840]  So that tent gets watered right before nighttime.
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.240]  And this is if this works for you.
[25:05.240 --> 25:07.240]  I don't know if you're watering yourself or if you're...
[25:07.240 --> 25:08.520]  It says you got a pump and a res,
[25:08.520 --> 25:10.520]  so you might be doing fucking auto watering,
[25:10.520 --> 25:11.720]  and we'll talk about that next.
[25:11.720 --> 25:15.360]  But I would get in there 15 minutes before that first light went off.
[25:15.360 --> 25:17.240]  Give yourself 15 minutes to water.
[25:17.240 --> 25:19.080]  It should be long enough to water a tent.
[25:19.080 --> 25:21.360]  Hit them with water, get them wet, do some defoliating,
[25:21.360 --> 25:23.920]  check out whatever needs to be done in the room, zip it up.
[25:23.920 --> 25:24.760]  The lights will go off.
[25:24.760 --> 25:26.080]  The other tent comes on.
[25:26.080 --> 25:28.200]  Water that bad bitch in 15 minutes.
[25:28.200 --> 25:30.720]  Do your defoliating, zip them up and get them out of there.
[25:30.720 --> 25:33.000]  Should take you about 30 minutes to water both of those tents.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.600]  If you need more time, extend your time, both sides.
[25:35.600 --> 25:36.200]  Make it happen.
[25:36.200 --> 25:38.160]  That way you're in there when the flip happens
[25:38.160 --> 25:40.400]  and you're not disrupting any light cycles.
[25:40.400 --> 25:43.720]  Of course, it is ideal to water right at the lights on time,
[25:43.720 --> 25:44.600]  right at sunrise.
[25:44.600 --> 25:47.720]  That gives the plants all day to metabolize those nutrients you gave them.
[25:47.720 --> 25:49.440]  Then they can rest and sleep at night.
[25:49.440 --> 25:50.600]  They can grow.
[25:50.600 --> 25:52.880]  Babies do their growing when they're sleeping.
[25:52.880 --> 25:54.280]  But you don't have that opportunity.
[25:54.280 --> 25:59.160]  Now, if you can't get in there and water yourself, if you're using a pump
[25:59.160 --> 26:01.080]  and you're using an auto system and a reservoir,
[26:01.080 --> 26:04.640]  why can't we set two timers and have them water at two different times?
[26:04.640 --> 26:06.000]  Maybe you don't have a splitter.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.320]  Maybe you got to water it all at once.
[26:07.320 --> 26:08.360]  Maybe it's on one split.
[26:08.360 --> 26:10.600]  Maybe it's all on one watering system.
[26:10.600 --> 26:14.160]  In that case, water whenever is best for you.
[26:14.160 --> 26:16.600]  Water when one comes on.
[26:16.600 --> 26:19.320]  Or maybe in the middle of one night cycle.
[26:19.320 --> 26:22.200]  That way one's in the middle of the day and one's in the middle of the night.
[26:22.200 --> 26:22.480]  I don't know.
[26:22.480 --> 26:26.240]  You're going to have to adjust to what works for your life right there, I guess.
[26:26.240 --> 26:29.280]  Because I keep saying it, it's best to water when the lights come on.
[26:29.280 --> 26:33.520]  So maybe your best bet is to water right in the middle of one flower cycle.
[26:33.520 --> 26:35.040]  So you got seven to seven.
[26:35.040 --> 26:35.720]  What's in the middle there?
[26:35.720 --> 26:37.960]  Eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 1 o'clock.
[26:37.960 --> 26:39.760]  So water at 1 PM.
[26:39.760 --> 26:41.400]  No, water at 1 AM.
[26:41.400 --> 26:44.080]  And that way, one is sleeping and it's only got six hours
[26:44.080 --> 26:44.840]  till the lights come on.
[26:44.840 --> 26:47.520]  You don't spend too much time super wet in the dark.
[26:47.520 --> 26:50.320]  And that way, the other one still got six hours to metabolize.
[26:50.320 --> 26:52.240]  It's still got some water for the dark time.
[26:52.240 --> 26:55.160]  You're going to be OK at any time of the day that you do it, honestly.
[26:55.160 --> 26:57.600]  I know you were looking for a more specific piece of advice,
[26:57.600 --> 27:00.520]  but without knowing if you're the one watering them by hand
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.720]  or if you've got a system to do it, I'm not sure what to tell you.
[27:03.720 --> 27:06.760]  Again, if you're doing it by hand, get in there 15, 20 minutes
[27:06.760 --> 27:10.280]  before one goes off, water it, close it up, open up the next one, do it,
[27:10.280 --> 27:12.680]  get the fuck out for the day, call it a done deal.
[27:12.720 --> 27:16.960]  If it's a machine doing it, anytime, bro, anytime, it's all going to be
[27:17.320 --> 27:20.760]  one of them is going to get watered at a dark cycle at an inopportune time.
[27:21.040 --> 27:22.320]  But they're cannabis plants.
[27:22.320 --> 27:25.200]  They'll survive. They will work. It's not going to be detrimental.
[27:25.360 --> 27:26.800]  All right. I want to thank you for the great message.
[27:26.800 --> 27:30.160]  Big shout out to my friend Green Thumb Kells from Instagram.
[27:30.360 --> 27:32.040]  I do appreciate the message.
[27:32.040 --> 27:36.040]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis cultivation or cannabis culture question,
[27:36.040 --> 27:36.920]  I would love to hear from you.
[27:36.920 --> 27:40.480]  The email address again is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.

[27:51.280 --> 27:53.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,

[27:57.160 --> 28:00.720]  seed hoarders, joint rollers, blunt smokers and dab takers.
[28:00.920 --> 28:02.800]  I think that includes everybody.
[28:02.800 --> 28:04.840]  I want to thank you guys for listening to this podcast.

[28:05.600 --> 28:07.920]  This was a fun episode. This flowed quite smoothly.
[28:08.080 --> 28:10.040]  This was all one take. I enjoy that.
[28:10.040 --> 28:11.560]  One take episodes are always great.
[28:12.760 --> 28:15.480]  I want to give a big shout out to my friends at seedsherenow.com.

[28:28.320 --> 28:32.560]  section. You can get a pack of the cream for $30. Make sure you check them out.

[28:41.840 --> 28:45.080]  did I say that part of questions, concerns, corrections, I did email addresses,
[28:45.080 --> 28:48.520]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com can never say that too many times.
[28:48.720 --> 28:51.000]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
