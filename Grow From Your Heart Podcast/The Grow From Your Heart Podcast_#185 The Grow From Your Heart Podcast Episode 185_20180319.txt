[00:17.080 --> 00:19.640]  Welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.640 --> 00:21.640]  It's time for episode number 185
[00:21.640 --> 00:23.480]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.480 --> 00:27.140]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.140 --> 00:28.280]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.640]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.640 --> 00:32.000]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:34.000 --> 00:36.680]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.680 --> 00:38.960]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.880]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.880 --> 00:43.800]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.800 --> 00:46.000]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:46.000 --> 00:47.560]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.560 --> 00:50.280]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:50.280 --> 00:51.840]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot,
[00:51.840 --> 00:54.100]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:56.000 --> 00:57.440]  I hope everybody's having a great week.
[00:57.440 --> 00:59.520]  I hope I'm starting off your Monday properly
[00:59.520 --> 01:01.560]  or whatever day you choose to listen to this.
[01:01.560 --> 01:02.880]  Most people listen on Mondays.
[01:02.880 --> 01:04.760]  I like to get the week started
[01:04.760 --> 01:06.860]  because I am having a fantastic week.
[01:08.060 --> 01:09.680]  Wednesday was my birthday.
[01:09.680 --> 01:10.540]  I had a good time at work.
[01:10.540 --> 01:12.040]  All my friends were having a fun time with me,
[01:12.040 --> 01:14.200]  wishing me a happy birthday.
[01:14.200 --> 01:16.520]  But after work, I got to go to a party.
[01:16.520 --> 01:19.440]  The lovely Jenny Beth organized a party for me.
[01:19.440 --> 01:21.760]  I showed up at Jenny Beth's house to pick her up for dinner.
[01:21.760 --> 01:23.040]  And when I walked in, I was greeted
[01:23.040 --> 01:25.240]  with the classic surprise.
[01:25.240 --> 01:27.360]  So I got a big old surprise party.
[01:27.360 --> 01:28.300]  Let's see who was there.
[01:28.300 --> 01:30.600]  White Mike was there, big shout out to White Mike.
[01:30.600 --> 01:32.700]  Chris and Lindsey, also known as the Traveling Stoner
[01:32.700 --> 01:34.840]  and Bobo Blaster Co., they were there.
[01:34.840 --> 01:37.400]  Will and Rachel, the Barefoot Couple were there.
[01:37.400 --> 01:38.500]  Jesse and Burn showed up.
[01:38.500 --> 01:41.000]  And of course, the lovely and beautiful Jenny Beth was there.
[01:41.000 --> 01:43.280]  And also, yo, I got to see Mick the Dog, you guys.
[01:43.280 --> 01:44.600]  I haven't seen Mick the Dog in a little bit,
[01:44.600 --> 01:46.320]  so it was great to hang out with Mick the Dog.
[01:46.320 --> 01:48.520]  Got to scratch him a little bit.
[01:48.520 --> 01:49.920]  It was good seeing that dude.
[01:49.920 --> 01:51.760]  A big shout out to everybody that came to my birthday party.
[01:51.760 --> 01:53.520]  I really appreciate each and every one of you guys.
[01:53.520 --> 01:55.200]  It was awesome to walk into a surprise party
[01:55.200 --> 01:57.400]  and see all my friends hanging out.
[01:57.400 --> 01:59.320]  Big, huge shout out to Jenny Beth
[01:59.320 --> 02:01.040]  for organizing the birthday party,
[02:01.040 --> 02:02.720]  for putting together food.
[02:02.720 --> 02:05.680]  You guys, Jenny Beth made sure that everybody
[02:05.680 --> 02:07.600]  had a bunch of medicated food.
[02:07.600 --> 02:09.680]  And she had some cupcakes made
[02:09.680 --> 02:12.320]  that were decorated to look like vaginas.
[02:12.320 --> 02:15.400]  So at the end of the night, everybody ate a little vagina.
[02:15.400 --> 02:16.880]  So big shout out to everybody that came to the party.
[02:16.880 --> 02:18.080]  Super huge shout out to Jenny Beth
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.960]  for throwing me a surprise birthday party.
[02:19.960 --> 02:20.800]  Thank you very much.
[02:20.800 --> 02:22.040]  I love you to death.
[02:22.040 --> 02:22.880]  I appreciate it.
[02:22.880 --> 02:24.560]  Also, big, huge thank you.
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.160]  Huge shout out to everybody who wished me a happy birthday,
[02:27.160 --> 02:29.480]  whether it was on Twitter, if it was through a text,
[02:29.480 --> 02:32.080]  if it was an email, if you did it on Facebook, Instagram,
[02:32.080 --> 02:33.680]  however you wished me a birthday wish.
[02:33.680 --> 02:35.160]  Thank you, I appreciate it.
[02:35.160 --> 02:36.120]  I had a great birthday.
[02:36.120 --> 02:38.160]  I'm still having a great birthday weekend.
[02:38.160 --> 02:39.560]  I had a good birthday dinner tonight.
[02:39.560 --> 02:41.280]  Hung out with JB a little bit.
[02:41.280 --> 02:43.080]  Now I'm recording a podcast for all my friends.
[02:43.080 --> 02:44.680]  So things are going very well.
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.400]  Also, Tim from Organica from New Mexico stopped by.
[02:49.400 --> 02:51.420]  I don't know if he knew it was my birthday week or not,
[02:51.420 --> 02:54.640]  but he was giving me a dab and he put a carb cap on my rig.
[02:54.640 --> 02:56.880]  And I said, oh, that carb cap fits on that rig
[02:56.880 --> 02:58.800]  better than any cap I've ever put on it.
[02:58.800 --> 03:00.560]  And he said, good, because it's yours.
[03:00.560 --> 03:03.760]  So big shout out to Tim for this dope new carb cap.
[03:03.760 --> 03:05.200]  It fits perfectly on my banger
[03:05.200 --> 03:08.560]  and it gives me a really super sweet dab.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.800]  Tim and I were talking,
[03:09.800 --> 03:11.880]  because my friend Tim is from New Mexico.
[03:11.880 --> 03:14.480]  He is, you know, I don't know his exact title
[03:14.480 --> 03:15.400]  to tell you the truth.
[03:15.400 --> 03:18.120]  He is a very high position with a dispensary
[03:18.120 --> 03:21.800]  known as Organica in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[03:21.800 --> 03:23.040]  If you are in New Mexico
[03:23.040 --> 03:25.320]  and you are a medical marijuana patient in New Mexico,
[03:25.320 --> 03:27.280]  I can highly recommend Organica.
[03:27.280 --> 03:29.600]  Organica has several great strains.
[03:29.600 --> 03:31.360]  This is not an ad, you guys.
[03:31.360 --> 03:32.600]  This is just how I feel.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.720]  Organica has Arise on the shelves most of the time.
[03:35.720 --> 03:38.960]  Their Arise has tested at 32% THC.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  So you might wanna try that
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.920]  if you're a New Mexico medical marijuana patient.
[03:42.920 --> 03:44.280]  They've got Zach Hayes.
[03:44.280 --> 03:46.040]  Zach Hayes is named after a friend of ours
[03:46.040 --> 03:48.960]  who unfortunately passed away of cystic fibrosis,
[03:48.960 --> 03:50.560]  but he has got a strain named after him.
[03:50.560 --> 03:53.240]  So he will live forever within the cannabis community.
[03:53.240 --> 03:54.080]  Big shout out to Zach.
[03:54.080 --> 03:56.080]  Much love, missy little brother.
[03:56.080 --> 03:57.520]  But here's what I was getting at
[03:57.520 --> 04:00.320]  with my talk about Organica in New Mexico.
[04:00.320 --> 04:01.680]  A friend of mine was talking about
[04:01.680 --> 04:03.560]  needing medical marijuana in New Mexico.
[04:03.560 --> 04:05.080]  And I said, hey bro, why don't you just drive up
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.400]  to Organica and go visit Tim and get some of that Arise?
[04:08.400 --> 04:09.440]  And he said, I would love to,
[04:09.440 --> 04:11.720]  but I am in the Southern part of the state.
[04:11.720 --> 04:13.480]  And I was like, what does that mean?
[04:13.480 --> 04:16.880]  And he replied with, there's a border check there.
[04:16.880 --> 04:18.800]  And I thought a border check in New Mexico.
[04:18.800 --> 04:21.160]  And he said, yeah, between when you're coming North
[04:21.160 --> 04:23.600]  from Las Cruces, New Mexico on I-25,
[04:23.600 --> 04:25.440]  there is a border check.
[04:25.440 --> 04:27.680]  And they're checking, and it's also as you're going South.
[04:27.680 --> 04:30.600]  If you're going South to Las Cruces on I-25,
[04:30.600 --> 04:32.040]  there's a border check.
[04:32.040 --> 04:34.880]  And they stop you and ask you, when you're coming North,
[04:34.880 --> 04:36.480]  they ask you if you've been to Mexico
[04:36.480 --> 04:39.400]  and they ask you if you have any illegal people in your car.
[04:39.400 --> 04:41.880]  And when I went through it, it was myself.
[04:41.880 --> 04:43.920]  You guys, I am white.
[04:43.920 --> 04:45.080]  I'm super white.
[04:45.080 --> 04:46.800]  There's no mistaking me for a white guy,
[04:46.800 --> 04:48.480]  racial profiling or not.
[04:48.480 --> 04:49.720]  I'm a white dude.
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.680]  My beard comes in kind of red.
[04:51.680 --> 04:53.400]  My beard comes in quite red.
[04:53.400 --> 04:55.240]  I've got blonde hair, blue eyes.
[04:55.240 --> 04:56.920]  I say dude and bro.
[04:56.920 --> 04:58.640]  I am white, there's no doubt about it.
[04:58.640 --> 04:59.920]  The guy that was with me, it looks like
[04:59.920 --> 05:00.840]  he could be my brother.
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.640]  He's my best friend, Rob the Dude.
[05:02.640 --> 05:03.920]  When we went through that checkpoint,
[05:03.920 --> 05:04.760]  they were like, what's up guys?
[05:04.800 --> 05:05.760]  Did you go to Mexico?
[05:05.760 --> 05:06.960]  And I said no.
[05:06.960 --> 05:09.120]  And he ran our plates and he pretty much sent us on our way.
[05:09.120 --> 05:11.000]  He knew we were gringos.
[05:11.000 --> 05:13.120]  So they're looking for illegal aliens
[05:13.120 --> 05:15.400]  and they're looking for drugs coming North.
[05:15.400 --> 05:17.720]  Going to the South, they were never looking
[05:17.720 --> 05:19.000]  for anything until now.
[05:19.000 --> 05:21.720]  Now they're looking for people taking their medical marijuana
[05:21.720 --> 05:23.040]  through that checkpoint.
[05:23.040 --> 05:25.440]  I was confused, but then I gave it about two seconds
[05:25.440 --> 05:27.600]  of thought and I said, holy shit.
[05:27.600 --> 05:30.480]  They can't drive their medical marijuana.
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.360]  So these guys, they're medical marijuana patients
[05:34.960 --> 05:35.800]  in the state of New Mexico.
[05:35.800 --> 05:38.040]  They have purchased medical marijuana in New Mexico
[05:38.040 --> 05:41.160]  and they cannot travel through that state checkpoint
[05:41.160 --> 05:43.920]  because it is a federally run checkpoint.
[05:43.920 --> 05:45.320]  And if they get caught with marijuana,
[05:45.320 --> 05:47.680]  they will be charged with possession of cannabis
[05:47.680 --> 05:49.400]  or whatever the charges are.
[05:49.400 --> 05:51.240]  And they will probably take the weed at the least
[05:51.240 --> 05:53.160]  and they'll probably arrest and charge them
[05:53.160 --> 05:56.760]  for crossing a federal border with cannabis.
[05:56.760 --> 05:57.840]  I thought that was very interesting.
[05:57.840 --> 06:00.240]  I just wanted to share that with you guys.
[06:00.240 --> 06:02.640]  Man, if you're in New Mexico, go to Organica
[06:02.640 --> 06:04.520]  unless you have to try to sneak through that border.
[06:04.520 --> 06:06.560]  I cannot suggest to anybody trying to sneak
[06:06.560 --> 06:10.520]  through a border patrol checkpoint with cannabis in your car.
[06:10.520 --> 06:12.080]  If you're a medical marijuana patient
[06:12.080 --> 06:13.240]  and you're having problems like that,
[06:13.240 --> 06:14.800]  getting your herb and having to travel with it,
[06:14.800 --> 06:16.320]  you know what I'm going to say?
[06:16.320 --> 06:17.720]  Grow your own cannabis.
[06:17.720 --> 06:19.040]  That's the best way to do it.
[06:19.040 --> 06:19.880]  All right.
[06:19.880 --> 06:21.100]  You know how you can learn how to grow your own cannabis?
[06:21.100 --> 06:22.460]  This is a super smooth segue.
[06:22.460 --> 06:24.020]  You can listen to old episodes
[06:24.020 --> 06:25.520]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[06:25.520 --> 06:26.880]  Before it was the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[06:26.880 --> 06:28.440]  it was called I Grow Culture.
[06:28.440 --> 06:31.680]  And I've been putting old episodes together in large chunks.
[06:32.640 --> 06:34.160]  If three episodes fit in a block,
[06:34.160 --> 06:35.640]  I've been putting three episodes together
[06:35.640 --> 06:38.080]  and re-releasing them as one episode.
[06:38.080 --> 06:39.320]  It may not always work that way
[06:39.320 --> 06:40.880]  because some episodes are going to be longer,
[06:40.880 --> 06:41.880]  some are shorter.
[06:41.880 --> 06:43.380]  I may only be able to fit two.
[06:43.380 --> 06:46.280]  I may be able to fit four or five if the episodes are short.
[06:46.280 --> 06:48.720]  It looks like my recording software
[06:48.720 --> 06:50.920]  and where I post my podcast,
[06:50.920 --> 06:52.760]  it looks like just over three hours
[06:52.760 --> 06:54.800]  is kind of the limit for what I can put out.
[06:54.800 --> 06:57.320]  So I try to go pretty close to three hours.
[06:57.320 --> 07:00.200]  I've put out episodes one through three in one chunk,
[07:00.200 --> 07:02.560]  and then I put out episodes four, five, and six
[07:02.560 --> 07:03.760]  in another chunk.
[07:03.760 --> 07:04.800]  And after I record this,
[07:04.800 --> 07:08.040]  I will put together the next two chunks of episodes
[07:08.040 --> 07:11.240]  and I'll release those hopefully on the next two Thursdays.
[07:11.240 --> 07:12.800]  I've been dropping them on Thursdays.
[07:12.800 --> 07:15.680]  So if you haven't noticed in the feed,
[07:15.680 --> 07:16.940]  the old episodes are up there.
[07:16.940 --> 07:18.680]  You guys just go look through the feed,
[07:18.680 --> 07:19.520]  through the titles,
[07:19.520 --> 07:21.640]  and it says one through three revisited
[07:21.640 --> 07:24.000]  and four through six revisited.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  And I plan on keeping that going until I catch up.
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.000]  And I'm doing it in chunks
[07:28.000 --> 07:30.960]  because people are asking for old episodes.
[07:30.960 --> 07:34.060]  And instead of just dropping the old episodes back in,
[07:34.060 --> 07:36.120]  because what happens is every time a new episode comes out,
[07:36.120 --> 07:37.720]  an old episode gets knocked out of the feed
[07:37.720 --> 07:39.040]  or only holds 100.
[07:39.040 --> 07:40.600]  So instead of just putting in one,
[07:40.600 --> 07:41.680]  I'm putting in three
[07:41.680 --> 07:44.160]  and you're kind of getting more value out of it that way
[07:44.160 --> 07:45.360]  without losing something.
[07:45.360 --> 07:46.800]  That's my attempt.
[07:46.800 --> 07:48.000]  Because if I just put one through three,
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  then it would knock out whatever the bottom three were.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.480]  I'm just, I'm trying to make it make sense for everybody.
[07:53.480 --> 07:54.400]  That's my goal.
[07:54.400 --> 07:57.000]  Also, another solution I came up with
[07:57.000 --> 07:59.160]  to archive old episodes was YouTube.
[07:59.160 --> 08:01.620]  YouTube does not limit how many things you post.
[08:01.620 --> 08:04.320]  I can post a thousand episodes to YouTube.
[08:04.320 --> 08:07.220]  So I have slowly been going and making old videos
[08:07.220 --> 08:08.180]  for the old episodes.
[08:08.180 --> 08:10.960]  I've got one through 25 completed.
[08:10.960 --> 08:12.000]  They are loaded to YouTube,
[08:12.000 --> 08:13.460]  but they are not public yet.
[08:13.460 --> 08:15.520]  I'm going to try to get up to 50 episodes
[08:15.520 --> 08:17.020]  before I make it public
[08:17.020 --> 08:20.180]  because people listen to things in such large chunks
[08:20.180 --> 08:22.480]  that if I don't put 50 of them up there,
[08:22.480 --> 08:23.720]  the minute I release it,
[08:23.720 --> 08:25.120]  somebody is going to tweet me and say,
[08:25.200 --> 08:27.160]  listen to all 50, I need more.
[08:27.160 --> 08:29.000]  So let me get 50 up there.
[08:29.000 --> 08:29.960]  Then I'll make them public.
[08:29.960 --> 08:30.800]  You guys can listen.
[08:30.800 --> 08:32.680]  And hopefully while you savages
[08:32.680 --> 08:33.920]  dig through those old episodes,
[08:33.920 --> 08:36.960]  I'll be able to produce the next 20 or so
[08:36.960 --> 08:38.520]  and try to stay ahead of you guys.
[08:38.520 --> 08:40.320]  And I'm going to do it until I'm caught up.
[08:40.320 --> 08:42.800]  Currently I'm recording episode 185
[08:42.800 --> 08:44.460]  and I've got 25 videos made.
[08:44.460 --> 08:47.360]  So I've got 160 videos that I need to make
[08:47.360 --> 08:49.200]  and it takes a little bit of time.
[08:49.200 --> 08:51.600]  I apologize for the quality of the first
[08:51.600 --> 08:53.060]  20 something videos.
[08:53.420 --> 08:56.460]  Uh, I wasn't real good with the record
[08:56.460 --> 08:57.900]  or with the video making software.
[08:57.900 --> 09:01.020]  And honestly, I'm just kind of phoning in
[09:01.020 --> 09:03.180]  the first 50 to get them done.
[09:03.180 --> 09:04.820]  I'm cutting and pasting images in.
[09:04.820 --> 09:07.100]  So it's just the same images repeated,
[09:07.100 --> 09:09.780]  but you're getting the full audio, which is my goal.
[09:09.780 --> 09:11.000]  It's all about the audio.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.860]  There'll be some cool images, but it's all about the audio.
[09:13.860 --> 09:15.620]  The first 21 videos are actually up.
[09:15.620 --> 09:17.420]  If you guys would like to go to,
[09:17.420 --> 09:18.700]  just go to YouTube and search for
[09:18.700 --> 09:19.980]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[09:19.980 --> 09:21.180]  It's really easy to find.
[09:21.180 --> 09:24.840]  You can actually watch the first 21 or 22 videos
[09:24.840 --> 09:26.420]  and let me know what you think.
[09:26.420 --> 09:28.340]  Also, if you listen to those old episodes,
[09:28.340 --> 09:31.300]  please tweet me and give me some critiques and opinions.
[09:31.300 --> 09:33.200]  I'd love to know what you think of those old episodes.
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.180]  Tweet me at GFYH podcast.
[09:36.180 --> 09:39.000]  I would love to hear your opinions of the old stuff.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.840]  A lot of people aren't into Twitter and social media.
[09:40.840 --> 09:42.180]  So if you want to contact me
[09:42.180 --> 09:43.100]  and let me know what you think,
[09:43.100 --> 09:44.500]  you can send me an email at
[09:44.500 --> 09:48.500]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[09:48.540 --> 09:49.680]  And speaking of emails,
[09:49.680 --> 09:52.580]  that brings me to the topic of the show, you guys.
[09:52.580 --> 09:53.740]  I received an email.
[09:53.740 --> 09:57.260]  It's kind of long, but it brought up so many good questions
[09:57.260 --> 09:58.920]  that I could not ignore it.
[09:58.920 --> 10:01.560]  So I'm going to take a fat dab.
[10:01.560 --> 10:03.940]  I might take three or four dabs to tell you the honest truth.
[10:03.940 --> 10:05.620]  Actually, I think I'm going to take a dab
[10:05.620 --> 10:07.640]  of this solventless hash that my buddy Chandler
[10:07.640 --> 10:08.780]  gave me for my birthday.
[10:08.780 --> 10:10.120]  Dude, thanks for the solventless.
[10:10.120 --> 10:10.980]  It's delicious.
[10:10.980 --> 10:13.060]  I'm going to take a fat dab of it right now.
[10:13.060 --> 10:15.420]  And then I'll probably take a dab of some Arise.
[10:15.420 --> 10:17.780]  And then I'll probably take a dab of Cactus Cooler.
[10:17.820 --> 10:20.860]  And then I'll probably finish off with a dab of Cascade.
[10:20.860 --> 10:22.220]  And then I'm going to come back
[10:22.220 --> 10:24.160]  and we will read an email from our friend
[10:24.160 --> 10:27.660]  who calls himself the Tricounty Bandit from Florida.
[10:43.940 --> 10:46.020]  Podcast world, I am back.
[10:46.020 --> 10:48.340]  And I have a confession to make.
[10:48.340 --> 10:51.300]  I could not take all four of the dabs I mentioned.
[10:51.300 --> 10:54.700]  I took a dab of that solventless that Chandler gave me
[10:54.700 --> 10:57.300]  and I got super high and I coughed for like three minutes
[10:57.300 --> 10:59.140]  and I had to go blow my nose.
[10:59.140 --> 11:00.620]  And then I thought I'd be cool to take a dab
[11:00.620 --> 11:02.540]  of that cactus cooler.
[11:02.540 --> 11:05.200]  And I went in a little deeper than I thought I went in
[11:05.200 --> 11:06.580]  and I had to blow my nose again
[11:06.580 --> 11:08.340]  and cough for like six or seven minutes.
[11:08.340 --> 11:10.140]  So the past 10 minutes of my life
[11:10.140 --> 11:12.860]  had just been me taking two dabs and coughing.
[11:12.860 --> 11:15.700]  But I'm back and I'm gonna shake off this
[11:15.700 --> 11:17.600]  fucking dab coma I just put myself into.
[11:17.600 --> 11:19.100]  And we're going to read an email.
[11:19.100 --> 11:20.860]  I'm pulling up the email right now.
[11:21.700 --> 11:23.660]  This email, as mentioned before,
[11:23.660 --> 11:26.500]  it comes from a guy who calls himself the Tri-County Bandit.
[11:26.500 --> 11:28.780]  We've read his emails on the show before.
[11:28.780 --> 11:29.880]  You might be familiar.
[11:30.740 --> 11:32.820]  You guys, this dude's emails get long
[11:32.820 --> 11:35.260]  and they get very wordy, but I can't ignore it
[11:35.260 --> 11:37.340]  because there are some golden nuggets hidden in here.
[11:37.340 --> 11:38.860]  Some of the questions that he asks
[11:38.860 --> 11:40.680]  are great for this podcast.
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.540]  So I'm gonna drop down the music
[11:42.540 --> 11:43.460]  and we're gonna read the email.
[11:43.460 --> 11:44.820]  It goes like this.
[11:44.820 --> 11:46.060]  And again, if you want to send me an email,
[11:46.060 --> 11:48.940]  it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[11:48.940 --> 11:50.460]  I just felt like a cheesy 80s DJ
[11:50.500 --> 11:51.740]  as I turned down the music and said that.
[11:51.740 --> 11:52.580]  That was weird.
[11:52.580 --> 11:54.180]  Anyway, you guys, here goes an email
[11:54.180 --> 11:55.820]  from our friend, the Tri-County Bandit.
[11:55.820 --> 11:56.660]  It goes like this.
[11:56.660 --> 11:57.500]  Yo, what up, homie?
[11:57.500 --> 11:59.580]  It's your boy, Tri-County Bandit from Florida.
[11:59.580 --> 12:01.860]  It's been a while since I last emailed you,
[12:01.860 --> 12:04.020]  but I've been steadily digesting them shows
[12:04.020 --> 12:05.060]  as you release them.
[12:05.060 --> 12:06.180]  Keep up the good work, bro.
[12:06.180 --> 12:08.220]  Your dedication is admirable.
[12:08.220 --> 12:09.060]  Dude, thanks for that.
[12:09.060 --> 12:10.500]  I appreciate it.
[12:10.500 --> 12:12.260]  Then he goes on to say,
[12:12.260 --> 12:14.980]  the only thing I can say I've been steadily doing for years
[12:14.980 --> 12:17.660]  is eating, breathing, and brushing my teeth.
[12:17.660 --> 12:19.520]  Anyway, man, I'm hitting you up to say thanks
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.720]  for all the shows.
[12:20.720 --> 12:23.600]  I'm a lawn and ornamental pest control technician here,
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.760]  and I love listening to podcasts,
[12:25.760 --> 12:28.160]  especially Canada-related ones.
[12:29.080 --> 12:30.400]  They get me through the day.
[12:30.400 --> 12:32.800]  With that being said, don't stop making them.
[12:32.800 --> 12:34.760]  Dude, I'll do my best to not stop.
[12:34.760 --> 12:37.200]  I am at 185 episodes,
[12:37.200 --> 12:40.240]  and I have got a list of podcasts that I want to record.
[12:40.240 --> 12:42.280]  I keep promising you guys the episode
[12:42.280 --> 12:43.540]  about building a drip system.
[12:43.540 --> 12:45.920]  I don't feel that that one's crucial to get out right away,
[12:45.920 --> 12:46.760]  but I've got it.
[12:46.760 --> 12:48.560]  It's on the first page now when I open the book.
[12:48.560 --> 12:49.960]  All the other episodes have been done.
[12:49.960 --> 12:51.400]  The pages have been torn out.
[12:51.400 --> 12:52.640]  That one's the first one I see.
[12:52.640 --> 12:54.640]  So the building an auto watering drip system,
[12:54.640 --> 12:55.700]  that one's coming up.
[12:55.700 --> 12:57.880]  I've got more episodes about how to identify
[12:57.880 --> 12:59.720]  and take care of pests.
[12:59.720 --> 13:02.080]  We're gonna do thrips next on that one.
[13:02.080 --> 13:04.480]  Then we're gonna talk about how to identify light leaks
[13:04.480 --> 13:06.880]  and pH problems and overfed.
[13:06.880 --> 13:09.400]  I've got a whole bunch more content coming up.
[13:09.400 --> 13:11.020]  Plus I need to get the Dabbing Granny
[13:11.020 --> 13:13.080]  and White Mike on a podcast together.
[13:13.080 --> 13:15.520]  They have never sat down and done a show together.
[13:15.520 --> 13:17.520]  I want to make that happen.
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.560]  I've got a lot of stuff coming up.
[13:18.560 --> 13:20.720]  So I'm not going to stop making podcasts
[13:20.720 --> 13:22.060]  for a really long time.
[13:22.060 --> 13:24.400]  That I can pretty much promise you,
[13:24.400 --> 13:26.100]  unless something terrible happens
[13:26.100 --> 13:27.640]  and I will still work through it.
[13:27.640 --> 13:29.560]  That's just how it goes.
[13:29.560 --> 13:31.360]  Anyway, the email goes on and says,
[13:31.360 --> 13:34.340]  you always say that your fan base listens
[13:34.340 --> 13:36.820]  to about 30 to 45 minute shows.
[13:36.820 --> 13:39.880]  Or my response to that is they ain't real fans, bro.
[13:39.880 --> 13:42.300]  I'm in it for the long haul.
[13:42.300 --> 13:44.520]  Well, not everybody can be in it for the long haul, bro.
[13:44.520 --> 13:47.360]  They're not out there killing bugs for eight hours a day.
[13:48.200 --> 13:49.800]  Some people have ADD
[13:49.800 --> 13:51.760]  and they don't listen to a long podcast.
[13:51.760 --> 13:53.520]  I prefer a long podcast myself.
[13:53.520 --> 13:54.360]  I like it.
[13:55.920 --> 13:57.440]  When I go to the Grow, the big grow,
[13:57.440 --> 13:59.200]  I'm there from six in the morning
[13:59.200 --> 14:01.720]  or seven in the morning till six at night usually.
[14:01.720 --> 14:03.040]  And I'm there for a long time.
[14:03.040 --> 14:03.880]  And just like yourself,
[14:03.880 --> 14:05.980]  I like to put in a podcast, hit play,
[14:05.980 --> 14:07.800]  and then not have to reach back into my pocket
[14:07.800 --> 14:10.400]  for another two hours to hit play again.
[14:10.400 --> 14:12.000]  That's why I listen to stuff like Joe Rogan
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.080]  because he's on for three or four hours
[14:14.080 --> 14:15.460]  just fucking rambling.
[14:15.660 --> 14:18.060]  I like Joey Diaz because he's on for quite a while.
[14:18.060 --> 14:20.220]  I like the Steve Simone Good Times podcast
[14:20.220 --> 14:21.420]  because that one's long.
[14:21.420 --> 14:23.560]  I like Doug Stanhope because they're just ridiculous
[14:23.560 --> 14:25.460]  and that one's kind of long, but you're right.
[14:25.460 --> 14:26.420]  Longer episodes are cool.
[14:26.420 --> 14:28.160]  It's why I've been trying to put out longer episodes.
[14:28.160 --> 14:31.580]  When it's just me, 30 or 45 minutes is enough.
[14:31.580 --> 14:34.660]  I can't even listen to myself for much longer than that.
[14:34.660 --> 14:36.980]  But thank you for the compliment and for wanting more.
[14:36.980 --> 14:39.660]  It makes me feel great that people want more.
[14:39.660 --> 14:41.180]  It's better to know that people want more
[14:41.180 --> 14:42.860]  than hearing that people are fucking sick of me
[14:42.860 --> 14:44.300]  and they're like, dude, shut up.
[14:45.260 --> 14:46.540]  I'd rather hear people say, give me more.
[14:46.540 --> 14:47.780]  So that's awesome.
[14:47.780 --> 14:48.620]  The email keeps going.
[14:48.620 --> 14:50.820]  It says like this, I listen to four hour plus shows
[14:50.820 --> 14:53.620]  on my phone because I got to kill eight hours a day.
[14:53.620 --> 14:55.420]  Not saying you got to make longer shows, bro.
[14:55.420 --> 14:57.540]  Just letting you know people are digging the content
[14:57.540 --> 14:59.860]  and don't ever sell yourself short.
[14:59.860 --> 15:01.260]  I appreciate that.
[15:01.260 --> 15:02.900]  I don't think it's selling myself short
[15:02.900 --> 15:05.060]  that people listen to 36 minutes of a podcast.
[15:05.060 --> 15:08.020]  That's just what statistics on my end show.
[15:08.020 --> 15:10.300]  And that's what ADD shows me, honestly.
[15:10.300 --> 15:11.900]  And most people are probably driving to work
[15:11.900 --> 15:13.220]  or something when they listen.
[15:13.220 --> 15:14.700]  Not everybody's got a job like us
[15:14.700 --> 15:16.260]  where they can put on the earbuds
[15:16.260 --> 15:18.140]  and listen for eight hours at a time.
[15:18.140 --> 15:21.720]  I love it when I can, oh, the day goes by so quickly.
[15:21.720 --> 15:23.860]  I go into work, check out the to-do list,
[15:23.860 --> 15:24.900]  figure out what do I got to do.
[15:24.900 --> 15:26.740]  I get set up for a couple of things.
[15:26.740 --> 15:28.640]  And then once everybody kind of goes their separate ways,
[15:28.640 --> 15:30.740]  I throw in earbuds and I hit play.
[15:30.740 --> 15:32.620]  And oh man, by the time it's break time,
[15:32.620 --> 15:34.420]  that podcast is over and I'm like, yes,
[15:34.420 --> 15:36.340]  time just traveled, it's so sweet.
[15:36.340 --> 15:37.300]  But I love it.
[15:37.300 --> 15:39.700]  Let's see, you've got a grow question.
[15:39.700 --> 15:41.900]  Oh, you also said, no homo, bro,
[15:41.940 --> 15:44.020]  but I love your attitude and personality.
[15:44.020 --> 15:45.300]  I wish I lived close by
[15:45.300 --> 15:47.900]  because I would definitely smoke you out, bro.
[15:47.900 --> 15:48.860]  Bro, I would love that.
[15:48.860 --> 15:51.700]  I would probably dab you out and get you so high
[15:51.700 --> 15:53.980]  that you had to crash on my couch for a couple of minutes
[15:53.980 --> 15:56.120]  because a lot of times that happens here.
[15:56.120 --> 15:59.320]  Then you go on to say, okay, onto my grow question.
[15:59.320 --> 16:01.100]  Sorry for the long email.
[16:01.980 --> 16:03.460]  I warned everybody, so you're cool, bro.
[16:03.460 --> 16:04.300]  We're getting used to it.
[16:04.300 --> 16:05.860]  This is like the second or third email of yours
[16:05.860 --> 16:07.420]  I've read on the show.
[16:07.420 --> 16:08.900]  So we're getting used to your longness.
[16:08.900 --> 16:10.500]  It's cool, do your thing.
[16:10.500 --> 16:12.740]  You go like this, just added a little walk-in AC
[16:12.740 --> 16:15.860]  to my grow and wanted to know how cold is too cold
[16:15.860 --> 16:18.220]  before I start seeing slowdown.
[16:18.220 --> 16:22.180]  I'm just so used to 90 to 100 degrees all day, every day
[16:22.180 --> 16:23.940]  in outdoor Florida weather
[16:23.940 --> 16:26.740]  that when I go into a 70 to 75 degree grow,
[16:26.740 --> 16:28.900]  it just seems unnatural.
[16:28.900 --> 16:31.940]  I know I don't want my indoor grow at 90 or 100.
[16:31.940 --> 16:35.180]  I'm just observing what works in nature.
[16:35.180 --> 16:38.900]  I've never had a grow this hot, I'm just asking.
[16:38.900 --> 16:42.340]  I also see that increased temps decrease THC
[16:42.340 --> 16:45.140]  or degrades it and it also causes the smell
[16:45.140 --> 16:46.920]  to kind of dwindle off.
[16:46.920 --> 16:50.300]  How do them outdoor guys pull it off?
[16:50.300 --> 16:52.180]  He goes on to say, maybe Colorado is different
[16:52.180 --> 16:53.980]  because it's cold most of the time,
[16:53.980 --> 16:57.900]  but does that mean all outdoor comes out looking like regs?
[16:57.900 --> 17:00.540]  There's gotta be a way to keep all that goodness.
[17:00.540 --> 17:02.500]  I think of them Afghani plants on the mountains.
[17:02.500 --> 17:05.260]  They get little newts, heavy sun and barely water.
[17:05.260 --> 17:06.740]  Then again, I never smoked that shit.
[17:06.740 --> 17:08.100]  It's probably whack.
[17:08.100 --> 17:10.740]  That shit's probably dirty and the genetics are gold.
[17:10.740 --> 17:12.460]  I don't know, explain this to me
[17:12.460 --> 17:16.300]  because we always say that environment is key.
[17:16.300 --> 17:18.940]  There's more to the email, but I kind of wanna stop here
[17:18.940 --> 17:21.860]  and talk about some of the questions you've asked
[17:21.860 --> 17:23.700]  and things that you have said.
[17:23.700 --> 17:25.660]  So the first actual question you asked was,
[17:25.660 --> 17:27.300]  how cold can you get your grow room
[17:27.300 --> 17:30.440]  before you start seeing slowed growth or problems?
[17:30.440 --> 17:32.500]  During the day, I would try to keep it
[17:32.500 --> 17:34.900]  around 74 at the lowest.
[17:34.900 --> 17:38.940]  And I try to go, you can go up to like 84, 80 at the highest
[17:38.940 --> 17:42.260]  but I try to hover around 77 is where I keep my grow.
[17:42.260 --> 17:45.740]  And I think things go very well at 77 degrees.
[17:45.740 --> 17:48.540]  You can get them down to the 69-ish if you really want to
[17:48.540 --> 17:50.300]  but there's no need for that.
[17:50.300 --> 17:52.300]  65 will really start slowing down the growth.
[17:52.300 --> 17:53.600]  You'll see problems.
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.220]  During the night, you can get down to like 65, that's okay.
[17:57.220 --> 17:59.380]  One thing I would really pay attention to,
[17:59.380 --> 18:02.820]  don't have a huge change in temperature from day to night.
[18:02.820 --> 18:05.260]  Don't have more than a 10 degree difference.
[18:05.260 --> 18:08.820]  So if during the day your grow is getting to 75, 77,
[18:08.820 --> 18:12.620]  at night, try not to get lower than 65 or 67 degrees.
[18:12.620 --> 18:15.780]  Keep a 10 degree fluctuation and no more.
[18:15.780 --> 18:17.160]  Any more of a change like that
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.140]  and you will really be promoting powdery mildew growth
[18:20.140 --> 18:21.420]  and also it'll kind of shock
[18:21.420 --> 18:22.980]  and freak the plants out a little bit.
[18:22.980 --> 18:24.960]  So you can get down during the day
[18:24.960 --> 18:29.300]  to like the low 70s at night, the low to mid 60s.
[18:29.300 --> 18:31.820]  And I wouldn't really go any cooler than that.
[18:31.820 --> 18:32.940]  You mentioned in this email
[18:32.940 --> 18:35.700]  that when you go into your 70 to 75 degree grow,
[18:35.700 --> 18:38.300]  it just seems unnatural since you're so used
[18:38.300 --> 18:40.940]  to growing your plants in a 90 to 100 degree environment
[18:40.940 --> 18:42.740]  outdoors in Florida.
[18:42.740 --> 18:44.620]  That's understandable but this plant,
[18:44.620 --> 18:46.540]  the cannabis plant is an amazing plant
[18:46.540 --> 18:48.620]  and it loves to adjust.
[18:48.620 --> 18:50.920]  Cannabis is a very adaptable plant.
[18:50.920 --> 18:53.460]  In your message, you start talking about how you see
[18:53.460 --> 18:56.540]  that increased temps decrease THC or degrade it
[18:56.540 --> 18:59.100]  and it also kind of causes the smell to dwindle off
[18:59.100 --> 19:02.260]  and you ask about how them outdoor guys pull it off.
[19:02.260 --> 19:04.300]  Then you mentioned that maybe in Colorado it's different
[19:04.300 --> 19:08.740]  because it's cold most of the time but that is not true.
[19:08.740 --> 19:10.380]  That's a misconception.
[19:10.380 --> 19:13.420]  Colorado gets hot as shit during the summer.
[19:13.420 --> 19:15.520]  A lot of the outdoor commercial grows
[19:15.520 --> 19:17.860]  are in Pueblo, Colorado where I am.
[19:17.860 --> 19:19.540]  This is what is known as the desert
[19:19.540 --> 19:21.300]  and sometimes it's called the high desert.
[19:21.300 --> 19:23.200]  We're at the base of the mountains.
[19:23.200 --> 19:24.820]  We are not up in the hills.
[19:24.820 --> 19:26.420]  It gets really hot here.
[19:26.420 --> 19:27.860]  I've seen like 106
[19:27.860 --> 19:29.620]  and I know that doesn't sound super hot to you guys
[19:29.620 --> 19:32.860]  in Florida because it's a super dry heat here
[19:32.860 --> 19:34.700]  but it gets really hot and that dry heat
[19:34.700 --> 19:36.660]  just sucks all of the moisture out of your skin.
[19:36.660 --> 19:39.380]  Down south when it gets hot, there's water in the air,
[19:39.380 --> 19:41.220]  your hair gets fluffy, your skin gets weird
[19:41.220 --> 19:42.820]  and all your clothes feel damp.
[19:42.820 --> 19:45.460]  In Colorado when it gets hot, it is dry.
[19:45.460 --> 19:47.420]  It feels like all of your moisture in your body
[19:47.420 --> 19:48.420]  just evaporated.
[19:48.420 --> 19:49.860]  It feels like you're touching the sun
[19:49.860 --> 19:51.520]  because you're up so high.
[19:51.520 --> 19:53.600]  So it does get hot here in Colorado.
[19:54.780 --> 19:57.540]  Don't be confused and think that it's cold here all the time
[19:58.220 --> 19:59.540]  because we do have some crazy temperature swings.
[19:59.540 --> 20:01.700]  During the end of growing season,
[20:01.700 --> 20:04.140]  it'll be really warm outside during the day
[20:04.140 --> 20:06.740]  and then at night it'll be really, really cold.
[20:06.740 --> 20:09.160]  It'll almost snow and then it'll be warm
[20:09.160 --> 20:11.380]  to where you can wear shorts during the day the next day
[20:11.380 --> 20:13.140]  and then it will almost snow the next night.
[20:13.140 --> 20:17.060]  So we see some huge swings but it's not always cold.
[20:17.060 --> 20:19.280]  Anyway, let me get back on track with the email.
[20:19.280 --> 20:21.580]  When you mention increased temps,
[20:21.580 --> 20:24.600]  ruin THC and it ruins the smell,
[20:24.600 --> 20:27.180]  that is more likely in an indoor grow environment
[20:27.820 --> 20:31.220]  because the bulbs create heat that is really close
[20:31.220 --> 20:32.580]  to the plants.
[20:32.580 --> 20:35.300]  When it's the sunshine and it's just environmental heat,
[20:35.300 --> 20:38.160]  the plants can kind of adjust because they're outdoors.
[20:38.160 --> 20:40.420]  Nature outdoors is king.
[20:40.420 --> 20:43.420]  It's sort of a nature versus nurture sort of a thing.
[20:43.420 --> 20:45.480]  Outdoors, yeah, it's 100 degrees
[20:45.480 --> 20:47.540]  but they're getting as much fresh air
[20:47.540 --> 20:49.060]  as they can possibly handle.
[20:49.060 --> 20:51.220]  The roots, if you've got them in the dirt, in the ground,
[20:51.220 --> 20:53.960]  they can stretch out really far and find the nutrients
[20:53.960 --> 20:55.840]  and find the fresh air and find the water
[20:55.840 --> 20:57.440]  that the roots may need.
[20:57.440 --> 21:00.580]  Indoors, you can give them everything that they need
[21:00.580 --> 21:02.480]  and everything that you wanna give them
[21:02.480 --> 21:05.280]  but you're only able to supply so much air.
[21:05.280 --> 21:08.000]  You can only give them so much oxygen, so much CO2.
[21:08.000 --> 21:09.800]  They can only get so much root space.
[21:09.800 --> 21:12.640]  There are only so many things you can control indoors
[21:12.640 --> 21:15.660]  and honestly, the sun is the king.
[21:15.660 --> 21:18.240]  You can have so many issues with the cannabis plant
[21:18.240 --> 21:20.900]  and put it under the sun because the sun is so powerful
[21:20.900 --> 21:23.400]  that it will give that plant the strength and energy
[21:23.400 --> 21:25.440]  to fix whatever problem it's got
[21:26.080 --> 21:28.600]  and a grow bulb just doesn't have the magic.
[21:28.600 --> 21:30.800]  Excuse me, the grow bulb does not have the magic
[21:30.800 --> 21:31.640]  that the sun has.
[21:31.640 --> 21:34.080]  You cannot duplicate that nature magic.
[21:34.080 --> 21:35.040]  So let me loop back around
[21:35.040 --> 21:36.360]  because I did get a little sidetracked.
[21:36.360 --> 21:39.880]  Yes, the heat from the bulbs and the stale air
[21:39.880 --> 21:43.000]  from a grow room will contribute to the loss of terpenes
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.440]  and the loss of potency because you've got bulbs
[21:45.440 --> 21:48.760]  too close to buds and those lights are just beating heat
[21:48.760 --> 21:51.280]  and beating lumens and beating par watts down
[21:51.280 --> 21:53.600]  onto the trichomes and onto the terpenoids
[21:53.600 --> 21:55.600]  and it's just destroying them.
[21:55.600 --> 21:58.200]  That doesn't happen as much outdoors,
[21:58.200 --> 22:01.000]  but you do get dirt and you do get rain
[22:01.000 --> 22:02.120]  and you do get wind.
[22:02.120 --> 22:04.780]  So you've got those things to deal with also.
[22:04.780 --> 22:07.040]  In the email you ask, how do them outdoor guys
[22:07.040 --> 22:08.800]  in Colorado pull it off?
[22:08.800 --> 22:11.160]  Dude, they pull it off with a lot of hard work
[22:11.160 --> 22:12.320]  and dedication.
[22:12.320 --> 22:14.160]  A lot of the people sleep at the grow.
[22:14.160 --> 22:16.000]  They sleep on site where the plants are
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.440]  so that they can wake up as soon as the sun comes up
[22:18.440 --> 22:20.400]  and they work until the sun goes down
[22:20.400 --> 22:22.280]  and then there are actually people that are in charge
[22:22.280 --> 22:23.640]  of checking on the plants at night
[22:23.640 --> 22:25.920]  in case some shit goes on weather wise
[22:25.920 --> 22:28.560]  or intruder wise or animal wise.
[22:28.560 --> 22:31.280]  That's a 24 hour job and it's dedication.
[22:31.280 --> 22:32.340]  That's how they do it.
[22:32.340 --> 22:35.260]  So you go on to talk about imagining this Afghan kush plant
[22:35.260 --> 22:37.720]  on the side of a mountain getting little newts,
[22:37.720 --> 22:39.760]  heavy sun and barely any water.
[22:39.760 --> 22:42.040]  Honestly, that's probably some of the best cannabis
[22:42.040 --> 22:45.400]  on the planet because that plant, it grew there.
[22:45.400 --> 22:46.800]  It probably got seeded.
[22:46.800 --> 22:48.960]  It was probably, there were probably males and females
[22:48.960 --> 22:49.800]  there, right?
[22:49.800 --> 22:50.800]  So that plant grew there.
[22:50.800 --> 22:51.980]  It got pollinated.
[22:52.680 --> 22:53.500]  It developed seed.
[22:53.500 --> 22:54.500]  It dropped seed.
[22:54.500 --> 22:58.160]  Now, it remembered that last year it got beat to shit
[22:58.160 --> 23:00.140]  by wind, that it didn't get enough water
[23:00.140 --> 23:01.780]  and it got way too much sun.
[23:01.780 --> 23:04.220]  So the seeds that come out of that are gonna remember that
[23:04.220 --> 23:06.780]  and they're gonna, the phenotypes that thrive
[23:06.780 --> 23:09.380]  in that environment are going to survive
[23:09.380 --> 23:10.460]  and they're going to breed.
[23:10.460 --> 23:13.540]  And the phenotypes that don't thrive in that environment
[23:13.540 --> 23:14.380]  will die off.
[23:14.380 --> 23:16.220]  It's survival of the fittest out there.
[23:16.220 --> 23:19.060]  So the shit that has been growing and breeding itself,
[23:19.060 --> 23:20.920]  that land race that's been happening out there
[23:20.920 --> 23:23.360]  on whatever imaginary hillside we're both talking about
[23:23.360 --> 23:25.480]  in Afghanistan that nobody can ever find
[23:25.480 --> 23:26.520]  because it's so hard to get to,
[23:26.520 --> 23:28.880]  but the best fucking weed ever grows there.
[23:28.880 --> 23:30.480]  And nobody even knows, no one ever smokes it.
[23:30.480 --> 23:32.820]  It just keeps growing and breeding itself.
[23:32.820 --> 23:34.720]  That's probably some of the best dankest shit
[23:34.720 --> 23:37.940]  on the planet because it's adjusted to that environment
[23:37.940 --> 23:40.680]  and it's in the most desirable environment
[23:40.680 --> 23:44.800]  for what it has adjusted itself to through breeding,
[23:44.800 --> 23:46.840]  through evolution, through selection,
[23:46.840 --> 23:48.120]  through natural selection.
[23:48.120 --> 23:51.020]  So it's probably pretty dank weed just through nature.
[23:51.960 --> 23:54.720]  I feel like a lot of the time people get in the way
[23:54.720 --> 23:56.000]  of the cannabis plant.
[23:56.000 --> 23:57.200]  A lot of the times people are like,
[23:57.200 --> 23:58.040]  dude, what do I need to do?
[23:58.040 --> 23:59.520]  I did this, I did this, I did this.
[23:59.520 --> 24:00.360]  What do I need to do?
[24:00.360 --> 24:01.960]  There's something wrong with my plant.
[24:01.960 --> 24:03.360]  And the best thing I can tell them to do
[24:03.360 --> 24:05.160]  is just leave it alone for a few days.
[24:05.160 --> 24:06.560]  You've done everything to it.
[24:06.560 --> 24:07.380]  It's beat up.
[24:07.380 --> 24:08.520]  It needs a fucking break.
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.840]  Give it a minute.
[24:09.840 --> 24:12.720]  And you gotta keep in mind, like this email says,
[24:12.720 --> 24:14.640]  these plants grow on the side of a rocky mountain
[24:14.640 --> 24:15.660]  where nobody is.
[24:15.660 --> 24:17.720]  I like to joke that it got pissed on by a goat.
[24:18.320 --> 24:19.480]  It got blown over by the wind.
[24:19.480 --> 24:22.000]  Like it lives a rough life.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.080]  So just leave it alone and let it do its thing.
[24:24.080 --> 24:26.800]  And sometimes that's the best for a cannabis plant.
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.040]  Wow, it feels like I'm super rambly, you guys.
[24:29.040 --> 24:32.680]  I've had a lot of Dr. Pepper and a bunch of sativa dabs.
[24:32.680 --> 24:35.160]  And I apologize if I'm just rambling my ass off
[24:35.160 --> 24:36.260]  through this podcast.
[24:36.260 --> 24:37.920]  I'm gonna hit pause and I'm gonna do that thing
[24:37.920 --> 24:39.880]  where I take dabs and drink and choke.
[24:39.880 --> 24:41.320]  And then hopefully that calms me down
[24:41.320 --> 24:43.720]  and I will be right back.
[24:43.720 --> 24:45.160]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[24:45.160 --> 24:47.000]  Took a couple of dabs, I drank some water.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.160]  I feel like I'm more calm.
[24:48.160 --> 24:50.880]  I feel like I'm zen and ready to do a podcast.
[24:50.880 --> 24:52.640]  Let's get back into this email.
[24:52.640 --> 24:54.000]  I did skip a couple of paragraphs
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.080]  because there was some chitter chatter
[24:55.080 --> 24:57.040]  and some personal stuff going on.
[24:57.040 --> 24:59.480]  And then he gets into this part right here.
[24:59.480 --> 25:01.360]  He says, can you speak on the differences
[25:01.360 --> 25:03.960]  between cuts and phenotypes?
[25:03.960 --> 25:06.280]  He says, it sounds like if you give me a cut
[25:06.280 --> 25:07.740]  of what you got in Colorado,
[25:07.740 --> 25:10.440]  it will form and express itself a little differently
[25:10.440 --> 25:13.620]  at my place here in Florida due to the environment.
[25:13.620 --> 25:16.800]  But if I gave that clone back to you in several years,
[25:17.560 --> 25:18.400]  would it be the same?
[25:18.400 --> 25:20.280]  Would it revert back to what you had?
[25:20.280 --> 25:22.520]  And also does that mean that each strain
[25:22.520 --> 25:24.840]  has endless phenotypes?
[25:24.840 --> 25:27.840]  I always thought that a phenotype was if you pop 10 beans,
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.600]  all 10 of that, each one will express themselves
[25:31.600 --> 25:36.360]  in a little different, showing itself to be a specific pheno.
[25:36.360 --> 25:37.500]  So I'm gonna stop right there.
[25:37.500 --> 25:38.720]  There is more to the question,
[25:38.720 --> 25:39.680]  but I wanna stop right there
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.320]  and kinda catch up with some answers.
[25:42.320 --> 25:45.960]  Yes, if I gave you a clone of one of my favorite plants
[25:45.960 --> 25:47.240]  that I've got here in Colorado
[25:47.240 --> 25:49.160]  that I've been growing for several years,
[25:49.160 --> 25:50.740]  and you took it to Florida,
[25:50.740 --> 25:52.760]  it would grow a little bit differently
[25:52.760 --> 25:55.240]  if you grew it indoors or outdoors.
[25:55.240 --> 25:57.320]  You would not have to take it all the way to Florida
[25:57.320 --> 25:59.680]  if we were doing this in indoor grow rooms.
[25:59.680 --> 26:01.600]  If you set up an indoor grow room,
[26:02.720 --> 26:04.560]  you could probably do it in the same building.
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.880]  Let's say we both rented a warehouse somewhere in Denver.
[26:08.880 --> 26:09.840]  I'm just going hypothetical.
[26:09.840 --> 26:11.200]  I'm throwing darts at maps here.
[26:11.200 --> 26:13.580]  We both rented, we rented a warehouse together in Denver.
[26:13.580 --> 26:15.920]  We are co-partners on this warehouse.
[26:16.760 --> 26:17.920]  We've got a giant rectangle building.
[26:17.920 --> 26:19.440]  We draw a line down the middle.
[26:19.440 --> 26:20.280]  We put a wall up.
[26:20.280 --> 26:21.880]  Now we've got two squares.
[26:21.880 --> 26:23.480]  You own one side, I own the other.
[26:23.480 --> 26:25.120]  I build a grow my way on one side.
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.440]  You build a grow your way on the other side.
[26:27.440 --> 26:30.080]  I cut two clones of Grateful Dog.
[26:31.120 --> 26:33.480]  I give you a clone, I take a clone.
[26:33.480 --> 26:34.960]  We both grow it.
[26:34.960 --> 26:36.520]  We veg for the same amount of time
[26:36.520 --> 26:38.480]  and we flower for the same amount of time.
[26:38.480 --> 26:40.400]  Our plants are gonna look different.
[26:40.400 --> 26:42.520]  Very minor details are going to make
[26:42.520 --> 26:43.880]  your plants look different.
[26:44.840 --> 26:47.480]  Things like nutrients will make your plants look different.
[26:47.480 --> 26:49.760]  I recently switched from botanic hair
[26:49.760 --> 26:52.440]  to veg bloom powder nutrients
[26:52.440 --> 26:54.440]  and my plants look completely different.
[26:54.440 --> 26:56.680]  I'm seeing colors I've never seen from these plants before.
[26:56.680 --> 26:58.960]  My Grateful Dog plants are coming out
[26:58.960 --> 27:02.040]  a really light purple color.
[27:02.040 --> 27:04.960]  They are not, they used to come out like a dark,
[27:04.960 --> 27:06.960]  I don't know, like a real dark, dark purple
[27:06.960 --> 27:09.120]  and now they're like a real light lavender.
[27:09.120 --> 27:10.180]  It's a really pretty purple
[27:10.180 --> 27:12.080]  that I've never seen from these plants before.
[27:12.080 --> 27:14.120]  So the nutrients are making a difference
[27:14.120 --> 27:15.880]  in phenotypical expression.
[27:15.880 --> 27:17.920]  Temperatures will make a difference.
[27:17.920 --> 27:20.840]  If your grow is a little colder or mine's a little warmer,
[27:20.840 --> 27:22.240]  it will make a difference.
[27:22.240 --> 27:24.120]  Humidity could make a difference.
[27:25.240 --> 27:27.080]  Light spectrum could make a difference.
[27:27.080 --> 27:29.480]  If you're growing with high pressure sodium lamps
[27:29.480 --> 27:31.360]  and I'm growing with LEDs,
[27:31.360 --> 27:34.460]  or maybe we're growing with the exact same lights
[27:34.460 --> 27:37.240]  and yours were three inches closer than mine,
[27:37.240 --> 27:39.640]  you're going to see a little bit of a difference.
[27:39.640 --> 27:41.440]  Just very small things like that
[27:41.440 --> 27:43.440]  are going to make a difference.
[27:43.440 --> 27:45.320]  And a lot of what plays into that
[27:45.320 --> 27:47.520]  is the stability of the plant.
[27:47.520 --> 27:49.520]  And that goes into breeding.
[27:49.520 --> 27:51.560]  It depends on which parents were selected
[27:51.560 --> 27:54.080]  and it also depends on which generation
[27:54.080 --> 27:54.920]  you are working with.
[27:54.920 --> 27:57.120]  If you're working with the F1, the F2,
[27:57.120 --> 27:58.720]  maybe up to the F5,
[27:58.720 --> 28:00.680]  the F5 is gonna be a little more stable.
[28:00.680 --> 28:03.280]  Hopefully, if it was selected and bred properly,
[28:03.280 --> 28:05.720]  the F5 will show less variation.
[28:05.720 --> 28:08.720]  That F1 may show more variation
[28:08.720 --> 28:11.360]  depending on the stability of that plant.
[28:11.360 --> 28:13.360]  So yes, you will see variation
[28:13.360 --> 28:15.800]  if you took a plant to Florida and grew it.
[28:15.800 --> 28:17.200]  Let's say we did this outdoors
[28:17.200 --> 28:19.420]  just to make it a little more intense
[28:19.420 --> 28:21.760]  because our outdoor environment here in Colorado
[28:21.760 --> 28:24.160]  is a little, we're very much like Afghanistan.
[28:24.160 --> 28:26.580]  We're rocky, we're in the mountains,
[28:26.580 --> 28:28.460]  we have drastic temperature swings,
[28:28.460 --> 28:30.600]  we've got hot, we've got cold.
[28:30.600 --> 28:33.280]  So then if you took a plant that's been growing outdoors
[28:33.280 --> 28:34.980]  and then you took that to Florida,
[28:36.080 --> 28:37.520]  the leaves will look differently
[28:37.520 --> 28:39.640]  because there's much more humidity there.
[28:39.640 --> 28:42.280]  I believe that the leaves will get a little bit thinner
[28:42.280 --> 28:43.520]  where the humidity is
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.280]  and they will get a little bit thicker
[28:45.280 --> 28:46.400]  where it lacks humidity
[28:46.400 --> 28:49.840]  because those leaves are trying to catch humidity.
[28:49.840 --> 28:51.800]  In a dry area, they will get bigger
[28:51.800 --> 28:53.700]  because they're trying to find more surface
[28:53.700 --> 28:55.200]  to catch more moisture.
[28:55.200 --> 28:57.120]  In a humid area, they're gonna get smaller
[28:57.120 --> 28:58.720]  because they're getting plenty of moisture.
[28:58.720 --> 29:00.800]  That's why you see sativa plants
[29:00.800 --> 29:03.640]  that are grown in tropical areas have those skinny leaves.
[29:03.640 --> 29:05.040]  I think that's why indica plants
[29:05.040 --> 29:07.080]  have those big, wide, fat leaves.
[29:07.600 --> 29:08.420]  That's part of their purpose
[29:08.420 --> 29:09.960]  is to gather moisture from the air.
[29:09.960 --> 29:11.640]  They're looking for humidity.
[29:11.640 --> 29:16.640]  So you may see that difference in Florida.
[29:17.660 --> 29:20.340]  Now, if you take a clone of that plant before it flowers
[29:20.340 --> 29:22.040]  and you keep it and you drive it to Colorado
[29:22.040 --> 29:24.280]  and you give it back to me and I grow that out,
[29:24.280 --> 29:25.760]  I will probably see the change.
[29:25.760 --> 29:28.440]  Even if it's several years, even if it's the same season,
[29:28.440 --> 29:30.400]  I'll probably see a little bit of a difference
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.340]  because these plants are such quick adapters.
[29:33.340 --> 29:34.240]  They're little soldiers.
[29:34.240 --> 29:36.200]  They will adapt in one season.
[29:36.200 --> 29:39.880]  This plant is only expected to live one year.
[29:39.880 --> 29:42.120]  It's supposed to happen in the spring.
[29:42.120 --> 29:43.280]  It's supposed to pop up.
[29:43.280 --> 29:45.080]  It's supposed to veg through the spring.
[29:45.080 --> 29:47.240]  By the time fall comes, it's supposed to be flowering.
[29:47.240 --> 29:48.960]  And when the winter hits, it's supposed to be gone.
[29:48.960 --> 29:50.600]  It's supposed to have dropped seeds in the ground
[29:50.600 --> 29:52.040]  so that it can do it again.
[29:52.040 --> 29:56.200]  So it only gets a year and these plants adapt very quickly.
[29:56.200 --> 29:57.720]  So I wanna get myself back on track here.
[29:57.720 --> 29:58.840]  In the email you asked,
[29:58.840 --> 30:03.680]  does this mean that plants have unlimited phenotypes?
[30:03.680 --> 30:04.740]  That kind of fucked with my head
[30:04.740 --> 30:05.760]  because I didn't know the answer.
[30:06.280 --> 30:07.200]  I was like, well, they're kind of
[30:07.200 --> 30:09.000]  because it's based on environment.
[30:09.000 --> 30:12.160]  But then I thought I should Google the word phenotype
[30:12.160 --> 30:15.040]  to give myself a more clear idea of what I'm talking about.
[30:15.040 --> 30:17.680]  And the actual definition from Google,
[30:17.680 --> 30:18.880]  this is where I found it, is Google.
[30:18.880 --> 30:22.280]  It says, the set of observable characteristics
[30:22.280 --> 30:25.520]  of an individual resulting from the interaction
[30:25.520 --> 30:28.240]  of its genotype with the environment.
[30:28.240 --> 30:30.720]  So that brought me to this conclusion.
[30:30.720 --> 30:32.760]  And I actually recorded two or three other pieces
[30:32.760 --> 30:34.420]  and I had to back up and delete it.
[30:34.420 --> 30:37.220]  No, there are not unlimited phenotypes,
[30:37.220 --> 30:39.540]  there are unlimited environments.
[30:39.540 --> 30:42.760]  And that phenotype will express itself differently
[30:42.760 --> 30:44.740]  in different environments.
[30:44.740 --> 30:46.480]  And that took me a lot of rambling to get to.
[30:46.480 --> 30:48.340]  So I hope that makes sense.
[30:48.340 --> 30:50.820]  That's why doing a pheno hunt for yourself
[30:50.820 --> 30:52.540]  with a pack of seeds is so important
[30:52.540 --> 30:55.640]  because you'll find the phenotype that grows
[30:55.640 --> 30:58.380]  in your grow environment that works the best for you.
[30:58.380 --> 31:00.500]  And I'm going to do an episode pretty soon
[31:00.500 --> 31:02.560]  about expectations from a seed pack
[31:02.560 --> 31:04.300]  because I've been talking to a few people
[31:05.140 --> 31:07.060]  about seeds and seed sales.
[31:07.060 --> 31:09.740]  And there is definitely a podcast due for that.
[31:09.740 --> 31:10.960]  All right, I want to get back into the email
[31:10.960 --> 31:12.820]  so we can wrap this up.
[31:12.820 --> 31:13.960]  He has another question in here.
[31:13.960 --> 31:18.020]  He says, I always thought that a pheno
[31:18.020 --> 31:20.260]  was if you pop 10 beans and all 10 pop
[31:20.260 --> 31:22.540]  that each one will express themselves a little differently,
[31:22.540 --> 31:25.300]  showing it to be a specific phenotype.
[31:25.300 --> 31:27.980]  Like let's say Gorilla Glue 4, for instance.
[31:27.980 --> 31:31.020]  Let's say you have it and it's available in seed.
[31:31.020 --> 31:34.940]  Can I pop a 10 pack and find that Gorilla Glue number four
[31:34.940 --> 31:37.700]  or is that a pheno based on some guy's environment?
[31:37.700 --> 31:41.140]  And if so, would a Colorado Gorilla Glue 4 be the same
[31:41.140 --> 31:43.180]  if you gave it to me here in Florida?
[31:43.180 --> 31:44.460]  And then he says, you get me?
[31:44.460 --> 31:46.300]  And then he ends with, sorry bro,
[31:46.300 --> 31:48.560]  once again for the confusion and long message.
[31:48.560 --> 31:50.240]  Much love bro, thanks again.
[31:50.240 --> 31:53.580]  You can respond via email or show, all is good.
[31:53.580 --> 31:55.740]  Well bro, here I am responding on the show
[31:55.740 --> 31:56.940]  and I'm going to answer the last part
[31:56.940 --> 31:58.260]  of that question for you.
[31:58.260 --> 32:00.340]  If you did get a 10 pack of seeds
[32:00.340 --> 32:02.300]  and the breeding was done properly,
[32:02.300 --> 32:06.500]  yes, you should be able to find a very similar phenotype
[32:06.500 --> 32:08.780]  to what the breeder has labeled
[32:08.780 --> 32:10.980]  as the Gorilla Glue number four.
[32:10.980 --> 32:13.180]  That's probably not going to happen with Gorilla Glue 4
[32:13.180 --> 32:16.060]  because it was accidentally bred, it wasn't done on purpose.
[32:16.060 --> 32:18.860]  But let's talk about a strain that I've bred
[32:18.860 --> 32:20.940]  that I can talk about that I know what happens.
[32:20.940 --> 32:23.260]  Firefly, Firefly is a strain that I made.
[32:23.260 --> 32:26.580]  Firefly is lemon skunk to a rise.
[32:26.580 --> 32:29.140]  Firefly has got three, you know,
[32:29.140 --> 32:31.220]  honestly most strains are going to show
[32:31.220 --> 32:34.180]  approximately three to five basic phenotypes
[32:34.180 --> 32:37.460]  in the F1 through F2, maybe F3 generations.
[32:37.460 --> 32:39.540]  You're going to get one that looks like the mommy.
[32:39.540 --> 32:41.620]  You're going to get one that looks like the daddy.
[32:41.620 --> 32:43.100]  You're going to find a phenotype
[32:43.100 --> 32:44.580]  that is right in the middle of those
[32:44.580 --> 32:46.480]  that shows both parents equally.
[32:46.480 --> 32:48.240]  Then you're going to get one that's fucked up
[32:48.240 --> 32:49.160]  and then you're going to get one
[32:49.160 --> 32:51.540]  that's kind of like amazing and stellar.
[32:51.540 --> 32:52.900]  It's either going to taste really good
[32:52.900 --> 32:54.100]  or it's going to have a lot of resin,
[32:54.100 --> 32:55.980]  it's going to be something stand out.
[32:55.980 --> 32:59.140]  Usually you'll find the one of those that you want
[32:59.140 --> 33:00.540]  and you'll breed to it again.
[33:00.540 --> 33:02.500]  And then you're going to get two or three phenotypes.
[33:02.500 --> 33:04.260]  You're going to get one that looks like mommy,
[33:04.260 --> 33:05.580]  one that looks like daddy,
[33:05.580 --> 33:07.500]  and one that's the perfect cross of the two.
[33:07.500 --> 33:09.780]  And if you keep breeding, you can narrow it down
[33:09.780 --> 33:11.820]  to where they all come out as the perfect mix
[33:11.820 --> 33:14.460]  or they all look like mommy or they all look like daddy.
[33:14.460 --> 33:17.520]  My goal is usually to make that perfect mix.
[33:17.520 --> 33:19.140]  I usually see traits in a male plant
[33:19.140 --> 33:20.980]  and I see traits in a female plant and I think,
[33:20.980 --> 33:22.740]  hey, if I put those two traits together,
[33:22.740 --> 33:24.380]  I can make one bad motherfucker.
[33:24.380 --> 33:26.380]  And that's usually what inspires my breeding.
[33:26.380 --> 33:29.900]  So what I'm getting at is you should be able to find,
[33:29.900 --> 33:32.260]  if you crack a pack of my firefly,
[33:32.260 --> 33:34.420]  you should be able to find the phenotype
[33:34.420 --> 33:36.420]  that I have been posting pictures of.
[33:36.420 --> 33:39.180]  Firefly has three very distinct phenotypes
[33:39.180 --> 33:41.500]  that I can identify early in flower.
[33:41.500 --> 33:43.940]  And if you cracked a pack of 10 seeds
[33:43.940 --> 33:46.180]  and you flowered them, by the end of flower,
[33:46.180 --> 33:49.340]  you will find one that looks just like the firefly
[33:49.340 --> 33:51.100]  I have been posting pictures of.
[33:51.100 --> 33:53.620]  And since firefly is not a clone only,
[33:53.620 --> 33:55.540]  Gorilla Glue 4 is clone only.
[33:55.540 --> 33:56.940]  He called it Gorilla Glue 4.
[33:56.940 --> 33:59.020]  I assume he had an amount of seeds.
[33:59.020 --> 34:01.060]  There were at least four.
[34:01.060 --> 34:03.160]  Maybe he had 10 seeds and Gorilla Glue 4
[34:03.160 --> 34:05.780]  was the one that stuck around because it was good.
[34:05.780 --> 34:07.760]  He probably got rid of all the others
[34:07.760 --> 34:10.700]  and it was probably labeled Gorilla Glue number four
[34:10.700 --> 34:14.060]  on a clone or on a bag and that just stuck forever.
[34:14.060 --> 34:14.980]  It didn't lose the four.
[34:14.980 --> 34:15.820]  It was just Gorilla Glue.
[34:15.820 --> 34:17.380]  There's also number seven now that I think about it.
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.720]  So there had to be at least seven.
[34:18.720 --> 34:20.260]  I'm guessing there were probably 10 or 15
[34:20.260 --> 34:22.020]  that he cracked, you know?
[34:22.020 --> 34:24.420]  So Gorilla Glue number four and Gorilla Glue number seven
[34:24.420 --> 34:27.380]  were the two desirable phenotypes that he found.
[34:27.380 --> 34:28.940]  I don't know what the differences are.
[34:28.940 --> 34:30.220]  I've only grown the number four.
[34:30.220 --> 34:31.260]  It was fun to grow.
[34:31.260 --> 34:33.220]  It grew huge, chunky ass buds.
[34:33.220 --> 34:35.100]  But once again, I'm getting rambly.
[34:35.100 --> 34:37.100]  So yes, if you do crack a 10 pack,
[34:37.100 --> 34:39.200]  you should be able to find something
[34:39.200 --> 34:40.620]  if the seeds were bred properly,
[34:40.620 --> 34:43.020]  even if your grow room's a little bit different.
[34:44.060 --> 34:46.060]  Hopefully your grow room is within
[34:46.060 --> 34:47.300]  a certain temperature range.
[34:47.300 --> 34:49.820]  Hopefully you've got a certain humidity range.
[34:49.820 --> 34:52.300]  Hopefully you're running a certain amount of light.
[34:52.300 --> 34:53.780]  That's what's keeping us all uniform.
[34:53.780 --> 34:56.300]  All the growers are hopefully within
[34:56.300 --> 34:57.500]  those certain parameters.
[34:57.500 --> 35:00.300]  So the plants are gonna show basically the same
[35:01.140 --> 35:03.580]  phenotypical expressions indoors
[35:03.580 --> 35:06.180]  if you're running appropriate environments.
[35:06.180 --> 35:08.260]  Outdoors, you may see some things differently,
[35:08.260 --> 35:10.140]  but outdoors is a whole new ballgame.
[35:10.140 --> 35:11.460]  If you're doing a pheno hunt
[35:11.460 --> 35:12.980]  and if you're looking for things like that,
[35:12.980 --> 35:14.340]  that's probably happening indoors.
[35:14.340 --> 35:16.900]  Do your pheno hunt indoors, find the keeper,
[35:16.900 --> 35:18.580]  run that keeper outdoors.
[35:18.580 --> 35:19.940]  That's how I would do it.
[35:19.940 --> 35:21.820]  So I guess that was the long way of saying
[35:21.820 --> 35:25.340]  since we are all running very similar grow rooms,
[35:25.340 --> 35:27.380]  yes, you should be able to find something
[35:27.380 --> 35:31.880]  very similar to the known, the Gorilla Glue number four,
[35:31.880 --> 35:36.320]  or what I'm calling the bud in the picture phenotype.
[35:36.320 --> 35:38.060]  But if all you've got to go by is a picture,
[35:38.060 --> 35:39.660]  how do you know if you're actually getting one
[35:39.660 --> 35:42.620]  that smells, tastes, smokes, has the potency,
[35:42.620 --> 35:44.940]  and is actually the representation
[35:44.940 --> 35:47.420]  of whatever strain, Gorilla Glue, Firefly,
[35:47.420 --> 35:49.060]  how do you know it's the one that you want?
[35:49.060 --> 35:51.460]  What I recommend is growing out a pack of seeds
[35:51.460 --> 35:54.080]  and finding the one that grows best in your environment,
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.380]  smokes best for you, works best medically
[35:57.380 --> 35:59.900]  if it's a medical product, works best recreationally
[35:59.900 --> 36:01.520]  if it's a recreational product,
[36:01.520 --> 36:03.360]  find the one that's ideal for you.
[36:03.360 --> 36:04.680]  That's what a pheno hunt's all about.
[36:04.680 --> 36:06.460]  If you're trying to get something that's known like that,
[36:06.460 --> 36:07.620]  try to get the clone.
[36:07.620 --> 36:10.700]  There are plenty of ways to get clone-only strains.
[36:10.700 --> 36:12.700]  But one thing I've noticed about a lot of these strains
[36:12.700 --> 36:15.160]  is they're all hype that lasts for just a little while
[36:15.160 --> 36:17.400]  until the next hype strain comes out.
[36:17.400 --> 36:19.620]  For a minute there, it was the Girl Scout Cookies,
[36:19.620 --> 36:21.400]  and then it was the Gorilla Glue,
[36:21.400 --> 36:24.680]  and then it was Tangy, and then it was some Sherbert,
[36:24.680 --> 36:26.400]  and who knows what it's gonna be next week.
[36:26.400 --> 36:28.600]  But it just changes, it was Skittles for a minute.
[36:28.600 --> 36:30.800]  So don't worry too much about a hype strain.
[36:30.800 --> 36:32.620]  Don't worry too much about what you read.
[36:32.620 --> 36:34.600]  Get a good pack of seeds if that's what you need to do,
[36:34.600 --> 36:36.280]  and run them and find the phenotype
[36:36.280 --> 36:38.000]  that works best for you.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  All right, I hope I was able to answer your questions.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.760]  That was a long, rambly email,
[36:41.760 --> 36:43.800]  and it made me become long and rambly.
[36:43.800 --> 36:44.980]  I do appreciate it.
