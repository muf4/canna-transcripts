[02:36.240 --> 02:39.480]  I do want to make a quick disclaimer here
[02:39.480 --> 02:45.360]  First of all, my words are having trouble coming out today, but also it is a super windy day here in Southern, Colorado
[02:45.680 --> 02:52.040]  We are having extreme winds if you hear weird noises in the background. I try to take out most of the noise with this
[02:52.880 --> 02:57.080]  Processing gear here. I will try to do some more corrections in the computer when I edit
[02:57.080 --> 03:00.720]  But you may hear some crazy noises coming through my air conditioning vents
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.560]  There was debris and stuff bashing against the house. If you hear noises, I do
[03:06.320 --> 03:14.520]  Apologize speaking of crazy wind tonight is the first cold night in Colorado. I've been complaining that it is getting cold tonight
[03:14.520 --> 03:20.860]  It is officially cold. I think I was just kidding before when I was saying it was cold tonight. Mother Nature is serious
[03:20.860 --> 03:22.320]  It's cold as shit outside
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.720]  If you had plants outside that were not in a greenhouse or some sort of protected environment
[03:27.860 --> 03:32.600]  Tonight was the last night or today was the last day to cut them down
[03:32.600 --> 03:36.640]  Most of your plants are going to start experiencing problems. They're going to get too cold
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.920]  of course last year we saw some amazing shit, but
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.640]  Ideally plants would be down by now if you've got an outdoor environment
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.800]  If you've got a greenhouse with some heaters or some tricks, you may be able to keep those plants going
[03:47.800 --> 03:54.720]  But tonight it is super cold. Everybody in southern Colorado is in harvest mode plants are coming down plants are getting trimmed
[03:54.960 --> 03:58.040]  Jars are getting filled shelves will be filled again soon
[03:58.040 --> 04:03.880]  It's a beautiful time here in Colorado, but everybody is in hurry up and harvest mode
[04:03.880 --> 04:07.480]  It is harvest time if you've been following around following along
[04:07.480 --> 04:10.860]  You know that I do have a greenhouse that had some plants in it
[04:10.860 --> 04:16.980]  I say had because today was the day we finished harvesting the greenhouse. All of the plants are gone. They're down
[04:17.060 --> 04:22.580]  They are safely chopped up and in a warm dry safe place to where the weather cannot get to them and destroy the seeds
[04:22.580 --> 04:27.180]  That we made I'm very proud of my my friends and my crew. I want to call them my crew
[04:27.180 --> 04:31.420]  They're my friends. I'm very proud of my friends that did a really good job growing this crop this year
[04:31.620 --> 04:33.620]  There are a lot of great seeds
[04:33.860 --> 04:39.300]  There will be let's see. There'll be lady marmalade blue raspberry truffle restocks very soon
[04:39.300 --> 04:45.540]  We made a bunch of those then there will be machine and Saka souffle seeds will drop sometime
[04:45.540 --> 04:51.020]  I haven't picked a an exact drop date for those they were planned for the endo Expo right now
[04:51.020 --> 04:53.060]  Once again, there's no update on the endo Expo
[04:53.060 --> 04:59.020]  So I don't know exactly when I'm going to drop the machine and Saka souffle seeds coming soon. Stay tuned
[04:59.020 --> 05:00.420]  You are excited about those
[05:00.420 --> 05:02.300]  I definitely will keep you updated
[05:02.300 --> 05:08.420]  But if you don't have some winter gear going on and your grow you might want to consider getting all your plants down if you
[05:08.420 --> 05:13.100]  Have not already because it is frosty cold here in Colorado. I had to fire up the heater
[05:13.380 --> 05:16.580]  There's a heater here on this recording space going feels kind of nice
[05:16.580 --> 05:21.280]  You could probably hear that thing making noise to got a long-sleeve hoodie on it's for real cold today
[05:21.540 --> 05:23.420]  Nature's not fucking around now
[05:23.420 --> 05:29.060]  I did mention that I had some friends and a crew working a greenhouse that kind of leads me into one of the topics
[05:29.060 --> 05:31.060]  I want to talk about on this episode of the show
[05:31.620 --> 05:36.940]  The reason that greenhouse worked is because I let those growers do their thing
[05:37.060 --> 05:41.700]  These people had a greenhouse that was already set up. They've been running the greenhouse for years
[05:41.740 --> 05:44.820]  We spoke I said, hey, I want to make some seeds in your greenhouse
[05:44.820 --> 05:48.580]  They said that sounds like a really good idea. We were came to a beautiful agreement
[05:49.020 --> 05:50.900]  They did a bunch of work on the plants
[05:50.900 --> 05:56.940]  I gave some great guidance did some hands-on work showed them some things some tricks some tips gave them a good strategy
[05:56.980 --> 06:04.420]  But for the most part, I honestly stayed out of the way and let them grow. It's their greenhouse. They know the flow they know
[06:05.020 --> 06:10.780]  Who is good at what who likes to do what they've got their systems and their ideas and their SOPs in place
[06:10.780 --> 06:15.980]  They were doing a different design a different girl because they usually of course don't produce seeds in their product
[06:15.980 --> 06:20.660]  They usually have a sensei bud a seedless bud, but this year they were making seeds for me
[06:20.660 --> 06:24.340]  So there were some changes to be made but with very minimal guidance
[06:24.780 --> 06:28.940]  My crew my team my friends were able to produce high quality seeds
[06:28.940 --> 06:34.700]  Mainly I think because I stayed out of the way and let them work with their style and their flow
[06:34.700 --> 06:37.820]  I could have gone in and I did of course
[06:37.820 --> 06:43.740]  I took notes on things that I didn't like and I made suggestions and we made corrections as we went. It was all friendly
[06:43.820 --> 06:49.740]  It was like hey, I see that you're doing this. What's your reason and they would give me a reason I would say cool reason
[06:49.740 --> 06:53.440]  I understand but I've been doing it for a long time. And this is what that is going to cause
[06:53.440 --> 06:58.140]  I saw one thing they're trying to do to prevent one problem, but it was going to cause two more problems
[06:58.140 --> 07:01.500]  We had a quick team meeting and we quickly agreed. Let's not do this
[07:01.500 --> 07:04.960]  I'd rather have small problem a than compounding problems B and C
[07:05.080 --> 07:09.280]  So there were a couple of quick meetings a couple of observations I took notes
[07:09.280 --> 07:11.800]  I thought of things that we can improve next year
[07:11.800 --> 07:12.960]  We've already talked about that
[07:12.960 --> 07:19.000]  But honestly, I stayed out of their way and just let them do their thing because they are experienced cannabis growers
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.060]  They have developed their system. They've developed their SOPs. Also, that's their greenhouse
[07:24.060 --> 07:26.840]  They know they knew what weather to expect
[07:26.840 --> 07:30.080]  They knew where the hot pockets in the grow was not the hot pockets
[07:30.080 --> 07:34.120]  We eat you guys the warm spots in the grow some people right now are getting the munchies because I said that
[07:34.640 --> 07:35.600]  but
[07:35.600 --> 07:40.880]  Free advertising there you go eat something better for you, but they knew all the problems and the niches of the grow
[07:40.880 --> 07:44.520]  They knew where all the switches all the bells all the whistles if we wanted to turn on something
[07:44.520 --> 07:47.600]  They knew where that button was so it's their place
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.040]  What I'm getting at is I see a lot of people on social media trying to give people
[07:53.440 --> 07:59.240]  Instructions and they say you need to do this or you must do this and they give crazy crazy advice
[07:59.600 --> 08:06.360]  What I want to say is do things your way and it will work there are a few rules of growing cannabis basically
[08:06.960 --> 08:10.000]  Keep them alive water them give them proper light
[08:10.000 --> 08:15.420]  And then if you have a successful harvest that you are happy with you did it, right if the plants don't die
[08:15.520 --> 08:20.240]  You're doing it correctly. You can do things better. You can do things differently
[08:20.520 --> 08:25.400]  But if you have a harvested outcome, you did it right if you were satisfied with it
[08:25.680 --> 08:27.800]  What we can always do is work on
[08:28.240 --> 08:33.040]  Improving what we have done the first time the second time the third time your first grow
[08:33.280 --> 08:38.640]  Allow your first grow to be a total train wreck that way you've got some learning and some experience from it
[08:38.640 --> 08:45.040]  If that first grow comes off perfectly, you're never gonna learn anything. Your ego is gonna get big you're gonna go I can grow we
[08:45.040 --> 08:50.520]  Let's just do it and your next grow is gonna suck because you got egotistical and you didn't have any mistakes
[08:50.520 --> 08:53.880]  If you have some adversity you learn a lot more
[08:53.920 --> 08:57.360]  So let me get back on my notes because I do have some sort of direction here
[08:57.360 --> 09:01.440]  What I'm what I'm trying to get to is do things your way. You're learning from me
[09:01.440 --> 09:04.080]  You're probably learning from books other podcasters
[09:04.080 --> 09:10.400]  Maybe your friends listen to all of us take all of our information then turn it into your thing
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.040]  You're hearing a lot of different things a lot of getting a lot of different input
[09:14.200 --> 09:20.000]  Kind of translate that interpret it how you would like and make it your grow that grow space is
[09:20.480 --> 09:25.480]  Yours design it the way you want grow the plants you want grow the style you want
[09:25.920 --> 09:30.800]  These plants do require some love and some care and some attention for a top-notch harvest
[09:30.920 --> 09:36.080]  But don't expect your first harvest to be amazing. You haven't developed your skill yet
[09:36.080 --> 09:41.560]  You haven't developed your style yet. And also don't expect that grow to be exactly like mine
[09:41.560 --> 09:45.920]  It doesn't have to be my grow do your grow the way you want develop your style
[09:46.680 --> 09:53.000]  Develop your skill set then it will all come together learn make some mistakes kill some plants
[09:53.480 --> 10:00.700]  Overwater some things over feed some things under feed some things get all the way to the harvest and then mess up the dry and cure
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.640]  Experience all of the pitfalls and mistakes that a grower can make I've done a full episode about making mistakes
[10:06.840 --> 10:10.040]  Because I've made plenty of them. That's why I'm a good grower
[10:10.040 --> 10:12.800]  I think that if I had never made any mistakes
[10:12.800 --> 10:18.160]  I've said it before I wouldn't be as good of a grower as I think I am now I can problem-solve now
[10:18.160 --> 10:22.680]  I can correct issues on the fly now I can anticipate and predict problems
[10:22.680 --> 10:28.080]  Like I said a moment ago, we were gonna correct problem a but I knew it would make problem B and C happen
[10:28.080 --> 10:32.080]  So we just stick with problem a and try to mitigate that as much as possible
[10:32.080 --> 10:37.280]  I can anticipate and predict the issues that will arise in the grow room from
[10:37.600 --> 10:44.520]  Experience if you stick with your craft and pay attention and fall in love with this craft and do it with passion and take notes
[10:44.520 --> 10:51.520]  And dedication is the word I'm looking for you will develop the skills the same skill set that I've got. I'm nobody special
[10:51.520 --> 10:58.240]  I'm just some dude just like you or you're maybe some lady some female or maybe whatever spectrum you find yourself in
[10:58.240 --> 11:02.520]  I'm just a person and I've done a lot of research and I'm passionate about my craft
[11:02.520 --> 11:08.360]  There's nothing stopping you from becoming this knowledgeable and skillful with this plant in a grow
[11:08.360 --> 11:14.160]  You can achieve this just learn pay attention. You might not be growing yet. You may be semi experienced
[11:14.160 --> 11:19.160]  You may be a better grower than me, but there's always something to learn and your style is always developing
[11:19.160 --> 11:25.440]  So don't think that your first grow has to be the best don't think that that's your last grow. That's your first grow
[11:25.440 --> 11:29.680]  That's the one you should make mistakes on if you make mistakes on like the ninth and tenth grow
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.180]  That's when we go
[11:30.180 --> 11:33.760]  Hey is this person ever gonna learn or they just gonna keep driving into the fucking wall?
[11:33.880 --> 11:40.280]  Make some mistakes on that first second and third grow so that you know, like oops. I overfed I saw crispy leaves
[11:40.280 --> 11:44.580]  I underfed I saw pale leaves. I didn't water one day and I got droopy ass plants
[11:44.580 --> 11:49.040]  I over water the next day and I got clawed and fucked up plants then start learning to identify
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.360]  Signs of heat stress cold stress other stresses start then you'll start seeing bugs
[11:54.360 --> 11:59.220]  You won't go what are these spots on my plants and you wait two weeks to treat for spider mice because you didn't even know
[11:59.260 --> 12:05.500]  They were mites just develop that relationship get in there play with the plants learn some skills kill some shit
[12:05.500 --> 12:11.060]  That's where I was make some mistakes. I've made crucial mistakes and big and small grows
[12:11.620 --> 12:17.080]  Let's make all of these mistakes early on so that we can get them out of the way get them under our belt
[12:17.180 --> 12:20.940]  Learn from them get a little embarrassment get a little humbling from it
[12:20.940 --> 12:27.940]  And then have that lesson in your tool belt to move forward with in the future to prevent us from making that mistake again
[12:28.300 --> 12:33.620]  Also that may help you predict and anticipate other mistakes that you may make you may be like hey
[12:33.620 --> 12:35.300]  I did something similar to this that one time
[12:35.300 --> 12:38.480]  Let me read my notes and then I'll have a big circle with an X on it
[12:38.480 --> 12:41.620]  Like don't ever do this dumb shit again because it made all the plants go crazy
[12:41.860 --> 12:45.300]  Like take some notes and learn a lot about what you're doing
[12:45.300 --> 12:49.860]  Let me get on my notes because I'm rambling and stone today. This should be enjoyable and
[12:50.540 --> 12:51.700]  educational
[12:51.700 --> 12:57.700]  When I see people telling people that they have to do some shit or that they must do this or just random instructions
[12:57.700 --> 13:02.980]  I'm like you're just sucking the enjoyment out of the plants let this person grow the way that they want to grow and develop
[13:03.100 --> 13:07.420]  Their style and their system and their flow of growing you'll become a good grower
[13:07.420 --> 13:12.980]  You'll have your own system your style every grower walks into the grow and we've got like a routine you do this
[13:12.980 --> 13:17.140]  And then you do this. This is how I mix. This is how I feed. This is how I do this
[13:17.140 --> 13:22.200]  This is what I check on. These are the notes I take. This is my cleanup procedure clock out go home
[13:22.200 --> 13:26.360]  Everyone's got their little system. You will develop yours that will work for you
[13:26.840 --> 13:31.560]  Your system doesn't have to be like my system. It doesn't have to be like the dude system
[13:31.560 --> 13:34.680]  It doesn't have to be Scotty real system. It doesn't have to be guru system
[13:34.680 --> 13:39.160]  It doesn't have to be anybody from any other podcast system or any other professional grower
[13:39.160 --> 13:45.340]  You've ever seen it can be your system make it a hybrid of all of the systems that you've seen
[13:45.340 --> 13:50.200]  I always recommend starting off simple and expanding there but start with the system that gets your attention
[13:50.880 --> 13:56.040]  Something will get your attention when it comes to growing a strain that you want to grow will get your attention a
[13:56.260 --> 14:00.180]  System will get your attention a light will get your attention when you do a little research
[14:00.360 --> 14:07.500]  Delve into it. All of the things will come together your setup your style and your system will kind of develop itself and it will
[14:07.500 --> 14:11.540]  Be a beautiful enjoyable experience. It'll be your comfort zone
[14:11.720 --> 14:17.020]  Once you get that grow dialed in it will be where you retreat to get away from all of the crap in your life
[14:17.060 --> 14:18.920]  You'd be like, ah something stressful
[14:18.920 --> 14:22.320]  I'm going to the grow and you'll just go hang out in there and it will feel good
[14:22.320 --> 14:24.820]  You'll forget about all the other shit that's going on in life
[14:25.140 --> 14:28.580]  Sometimes I say I'm gonna go in the grow and just hang out for like 30 minutes
[14:28.580 --> 14:32.660]  Maybe pull some leaves see if I can find anything that I can do just look for work in there
[14:33.020 --> 14:38.160]  And then I realized oh, yeah, I've just listened to like seven seven podcasts in here and I haven't really done anything
[14:38.220 --> 14:44.000]  I'm just like pulling leaves and popping stems and just just finding light work to do but time will just go by in there
[14:44.000 --> 14:50.040]  It's such a beautiful place. It smells good. The temperature is perfect. The humidity is perfect. The music is perfect
[14:50.040 --> 14:55.320]  The company is great. It's a great place to be so build your Zen space and have fun in there make it
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.240]  educational and
[14:57.240 --> 15:03.680]  Comforting and relaxing and enjoyable don't make it stressful because people on the internet say you have to top that plant you have to up
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.440]  Pop those your lights are wrong
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.600]  Everyone's got an opinion. Don't let it bother you do your thing
[15:09.600 --> 15:14.760]  Just do it your way. Of course if the plants are dying and if shit is failing maybe take some advice
[15:14.760 --> 15:20.400]  But if it's working and if it's only your first try do your thing and don't be afraid to make some mistakes
[15:20.400 --> 15:27.920]  Don't let people intimidate you the internet the internet tries to scare and intimidate people making them think they have to do a lot of shit
[15:27.920 --> 15:34.300]  That's not necessary. Don't worry about that. Do what you can do. I do my best not to intimidate you
[15:34.300 --> 15:37.460]  There are a lot of pieces of equipment to be involved in a grow
[15:37.460 --> 15:41.140]  There are a lot of skills a lot of steps a lot of things to be involved in a grow
[15:41.140 --> 15:45.620]  I try to go slowly and not scare you away with the cost and all the requirements
[15:45.620 --> 15:50.200]  I try to go real slowly and invite you. I want it to be welcoming and enjoyable for you
[15:50.200 --> 15:54.260]  So keep it that way don't make it stressful. Let me catch up on my notes
[15:54.780 --> 16:01.700]  Sometimes you will have to adjust and adapt your space and your schedule and your budget and your style and your goal
[16:02.700 --> 16:08.620]  Just adjust sometimes the things you tried to do might not work out after that first or second girl
[16:08.620 --> 16:12.740]  If you're seeing that something isn't working adjust and adapt don't be stubborn
[16:12.860 --> 16:17.100]  I've seen people try to make shit work if it doesn't work. It just doesn't work
[16:17.100 --> 16:22.180]  Let's adapt adjust and correct things and set ourselves up for success instead of spending money on
[16:22.700 --> 16:24.700]  lights soil
[16:24.700 --> 16:31.100]  Water nutrients, maybe you wasted seeds. Maybe you wasted clones. Let's quit wasting things. I do have another episode
[16:31.900 --> 16:36.820]  Planned and prepared to talk about how to save some money and budget better in the grow. So we'll talk about that in the future
[16:37.540 --> 16:38.540]  but
[16:38.540 --> 16:44.780]  People make growing really stressful and I see the internet trying to make growing stressful on new growers trying to prevent that
[16:44.780 --> 16:50.500]  Let's keep it fun. You guys let's just keep it a good time. It should be therapeutic relaxing should be the Zen zone
[16:50.900 --> 16:53.900]  I can make a big grow fun and enjoyable
[16:53.900 --> 17:00.500]  We run large grows with multiple hundred lights 500 lights and 20 people work in and we're having a good time
[17:00.500 --> 17:05.460]  We got the music up super loud. We're high-fiving each other when we get a row of clones done
[17:05.460 --> 17:08.700]  We all do the Ric Flair whoo, because we're all excited about it
[17:08.700 --> 17:15.100]  I try to make a big environment exciting and all that takes is just building a flow building a system
[17:15.380 --> 17:22.300]  Having a team that communicates and all knows what the final goal is and then just having a good attitude and setting yourself up for success
[17:22.420 --> 17:28.180]  Every day today you're setting yourself up for success tomorrow. That's not just in the grow
[17:28.180 --> 17:34.020]  That's everywhere. But in the grow you can see it if you don't do the side work tonight before you leave tomorrow
[17:34.140 --> 17:38.020]  You've got to do the side work before you can even start doing the real work
[17:38.020 --> 17:42.080]  So you're just rushing to get to the real work then you got to do the real work in a rush
[17:42.220 --> 17:45.980]  Then you don't get the side work done again tonight because you fucked up and had to rush everything
[17:46.180 --> 17:51.380]  Then there's always a surprise in a commercial grow always a surprise. I teach the new guys
[17:51.380 --> 17:54.160]  I say this a lot when I train a new guy in a commercial grow
[17:54.160 --> 17:55.980]  I just have them shadow me for a day
[17:55.980 --> 18:00.300]  And as we walk in I always say the first thing we're gonna do is find out what went wrong last night
[18:00.380 --> 18:02.380]  What pump broke what light went out?
[18:02.380 --> 18:07.300]  There's a lot of moving parts in a 500 light grow a lot of things can break. Let's go find out
[18:07.300 --> 18:09.660]  What happened last night? That's usually the first thing we do
[18:10.260 --> 18:14.940]  We still keep it fun. We still keep it enjoyable because that's I love the plants
[18:14.940 --> 18:19.160]  That is that is the main the main part is to have fun and enjoy this shit and the plants
[18:19.160 --> 18:21.900]  I think the plants can feel your vibes
[18:21.900 --> 18:27.420]  Do you ever walk into a grow and you just feel that life force that presence that energy that is the plants
[18:27.860 --> 18:30.580]  Why can't the plants feel it from us as well?
[18:31.020 --> 18:38.660]  If you're walking in there anxious disheveled nervous rushed the plants feel that what if you went to the doctor or the dentist?
[18:38.660 --> 18:40.660]  and the dentist had like a
[18:40.920 --> 18:46.660]  Distracted rushed disheveled feel or like they felt like they had to just hurry up and get shit done
[18:46.660 --> 18:49.460]  You might not go to that dentist. You may be like can I come back tomorrow?
[18:50.060 --> 18:55.140]  Like I'd rather come back when you've got time to like sit down and look at my tooth and actually do the stuff instead of
[18:55.140 --> 19:00.700]  Like drill it fill it stitch me up send me on my way and high-five me that that that's not what I need from a
[19:00.700 --> 19:05.080]  Dentist I want some love and care take your time the plants enjoy that too, and they can feel it from you
[19:05.420 --> 19:08.180]  All right, I'm gonna catch up on these notes. I'm stoned and rambly
[19:08.180 --> 19:13.100]  I want to make sure I got all the important parts here make it enjoyable and educational
[19:13.100 --> 19:14.620]  Those are the words that I have in bold
[19:14.620 --> 19:19.720]  There's no exact way to grow cannabis the exact way is the way that's working for you
[19:19.720 --> 19:24.500]  I've seen it done a billion different ways and guess what I've seen a billion successful outcomes
[19:24.500 --> 19:30.420]  So whatever is working for you do that shit. Don't let anyone on the internet scare you don't let them tell you you're doing it wrong
[19:30.540 --> 19:32.540]  Don't let them talk shit to you
[19:32.580 --> 19:37.620]  Let them give you constructive criticism and then learn how to filter out all the bullshit
[19:37.620 --> 19:42.640]  The internet is full of crap and you're gonna get some terrible terrible advice always ask why?
[19:43.120 --> 19:44.960]  When you when somebody gives you advice
[19:44.960 --> 19:50.720]  Just say why and see if they can tell you why if they say because my uncle Larry did it in the 70s and it worked
[19:50.840 --> 19:56.160]  That's not why that's just because uncle Larry did it. Maybe uncle Larry's plants are way different than yours
[19:56.160 --> 19:58.280]  Maybe you're growing indoors uncle Larry was outdoors
[19:58.280 --> 20:03.240]  Maybe you're in the northern hemisphere to Larry was in the southern shit could be way different. You never know
[20:03.240 --> 20:09.400]  All right. I feel like I got good and rambly on that. I did say that I've got an update from a previous episode
[20:09.400 --> 20:13.960]  Let's jump into that part here trying to get myself on some sort of a track. All right in a previous episode
[20:13.960 --> 20:16.120]  We talked about trellising our plants
[20:16.120 --> 20:20.360]  We had a listener or a viewer who wanted to use a 5x5 grow tent
[20:20.360 --> 20:24.180]  They wanted to trellis their plants or have some sort of supports for their buds
[20:24.180 --> 20:28.620]  But if they put up the trellis they were unable to get to the plants properly
[20:28.620 --> 20:32.560]  We have had some follow-up conversation from that viewer from that listener
[20:32.560 --> 20:38.400]  What they have decided to do is build the trellis system and an auto watering system and just suck it up
[20:38.400 --> 20:42.320]  Their next question was about co2 which I will address in a future episode
[20:43.140 --> 20:49.780]  Today, let's talk about the update on the trellis question. There was one piece that I greatly overlooked
[20:50.400 --> 20:57.680]  There's a grower that taught me how to take big pots and build an individual trellis on each pot
[20:57.680 --> 21:01.700]  I think what he was using was a 30 gallon tote that he would put on wheels or on
[21:01.800 --> 21:04.460]  casters and then he would fill the 30 gallon tote with a
[21:04.580 --> 21:08.400]  Soilless mix or a soil put some holes in the bottom of that for drainage
[21:08.400 --> 21:12.340]  Then he would use that soilless mix bed as like a big raised bed
[21:12.420 --> 21:16.080]  Then he would build a trellis system out of PVC piping
[21:16.080 --> 21:19.780]  He would put two four posts one post in each corner four posts in there
[21:19.860 --> 21:26.020]  kind of build like a table and then put a net into the table and then slowly lower that onto the plants and trellis the
[21:26.020 --> 21:29.800]  Plants out with that net that allowed him to move his plants around
[21:29.880 --> 21:35.440]  He could move them around the tent around the room around the facility and he could have them trellised out properly
[21:35.440 --> 21:40.440]  So it is possible to build trellis netting for individual plants
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.720]  I'm not sure why I didn't think about that in the first episode when we talked about this
[21:43.960 --> 21:50.400]  But as I was listening and editing I was like, oh you didn't even talk about the opportunity to trellis your big plants by themselves
[21:50.600 --> 21:52.160]  in a
[21:52.160 --> 21:54.920]  Tent so you could just use like a 30 gallon container
[21:54.920 --> 21:58.800]  I think it's a 30 gallon like a stir light bin or a rubber made bin
[21:58.880 --> 22:01.880]  Just I think it's 30 gallons. I'm pretty sure that's what it is
[22:01.880 --> 22:03.880]  They're about 30 inches by 20 by about 15
[22:04.320 --> 22:07.040]  Fill that up with your soilless mix or whatever you want to use
[22:07.120 --> 22:11.360]  Put plenty of holes in the bottom for drainage put it on casters. You can roll that around
[22:11.680 --> 22:14.840]  Then you just build a little square frame. It's a rectangle
[22:14.840 --> 22:19.360]  It's kind of like a table basically you can get creative with that as long as you got posts in each corner
[22:19.480 --> 22:24.680]  Then maybe extend it so it's wider because your plant will be wider than that pot if you do things correctly
[22:25.080 --> 22:27.560]  But make some extenders make it go higher longer
[22:27.560 --> 22:32.120]  However, you need it then just use that PVC frame put your trellis net right on there
[22:32.120 --> 22:37.660]  You can trellis your individual plants. Of course, those are gigantic plants. Those are big but that does work
[22:38.680 --> 22:44.520]  Recently while shopping in a big-box hardware store. I know I shouldn't go to the big-box stores, but it was my only option
[22:44.520 --> 22:50.780]  I did see a 16 inch tomato cage with a built-in trellis on the top
[22:50.780 --> 22:56.680]  That's right. The top layer of the tomato cage had a square grid built onto the top of it
[22:56.680 --> 23:01.280]  So if you want to do a small individual trellis system, that would be a great way to do it
[23:01.280 --> 23:07.560]  Just pull one bud through each square have a nice even canopy going on there. That would be a beautiful idea
[23:08.000 --> 23:11.400]  All right. That was my update for the trellising episode
[23:11.400 --> 23:13.560]  I did want to make sure to include those two pieces
[23:13.640 --> 23:19.440]  You can trellis individual pots by building a PVC trellis or you can use the pre-made
[23:20.080 --> 23:22.800]  Circle tomato cage with the trellis on top
[23:22.800 --> 23:25.760]  I've also seen people put sticks in each corner use a
[23:26.120 --> 23:31.840]  Twisty tie or that garden tape and just build like a spiral up and use that to put the branches in place
[23:31.960 --> 23:37.560]  Get creative you guys once again, there's no wrong way to do it as long as the plants are successful
[23:37.720 --> 23:44.360]  As long as you're happy with it, there's always room for improvement, but there's no wrong way to do it
[23:44.760 --> 23:45.440]  All right
[23:45.440 --> 23:50.800]  Ladies and gentlemen boys girls pamps hoes friends foes smokers growers clone cutters pollen chuckers
[23:50.800 --> 23:53.600]  All of you beautiful cannabis growers and smokers out there
