[00:00.000 --> 00:01.760]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[00:01.760 --> 00:06.520]  I'm your host, Ross DeJeff, and it is time for episode 508 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:06.520 --> 00:08.120]  podcast.

[00:44.440 --> 00:47.720]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:47.720 --> 00:53.160]  Today, I've been taking big dabs of Double OG Full Spectrum Extract from our friends
[00:53.160 --> 00:54.520]  at Green Dot Labs.
[00:54.520 --> 00:57.860]  This is a blend of Legend OG and Sour Double.
[00:57.860 --> 01:02.760]  On the package, the flavor is described as Pine, Sour, and Lemons.
[01:02.760 --> 01:05.640]  I will completely agree with that flavor description.
[01:05.640 --> 01:11.080]  It smells like somebody cleaned a skunk's ass with lemon pledge here in my recording
[01:11.080 --> 01:12.080]  space.
[01:12.080 --> 01:17.560]  On the back of the package, it says this product contains 62.03% THC.
[01:17.560 --> 01:18.840]  I really love the flavor.
[01:18.840 --> 01:21.480]  I really love the buzz of the Double OG.
[01:21.480 --> 01:27.800]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:27.800 --> 01:31.440]  Alright Podcast World, I've got a great Thursday show lined up for you.
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.760]  Before we get to the details, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends who support
[01:35.760 --> 01:38.080]  the show on Patreon.
[01:38.080 --> 01:40.920]  Let's start off with a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:40.920 --> 01:43.600]  High five and a thank you shout out to my friend Red Beard.
[01:43.600 --> 01:46.800]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Rue Lightning Tim.
[01:46.800 --> 01:50.080]  I always want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Michael W.
[01:50.200 --> 01:53.760]  Let's send a big thank you fist bump and a high five to Lernon and Bernon.
[01:53.760 --> 01:56.600]  I always want to send a big thank you to my friend Victor.
[01:56.600 --> 02:01.720]  Let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast high five and thank you to Woodside195.
[02:01.720 --> 02:05.360]  I always want to send that big thank you shout out to my friend TheGabacho.
[02:05.360 --> 02:08.360]  We always owe a big thank you fist bump and a high five to Riley.
[02:08.360 --> 02:12.120]  How about a big thank you shout out to my new friend Jose Paz.
[02:12.120 --> 02:16.280]  And of course, I always need to send a big high five and a thank you shout out to my
[02:16.280 --> 02:19.200]  good friend Stabby McStabwood.
[02:19.320 --> 02:23.320]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who supports the show and has continued to
[02:23.320 --> 02:25.080]  support the show on Patreon.
[02:25.080 --> 02:27.780]  I could not do it without your support.
[02:27.780 --> 02:33.080]  The computer that I am using to record this show was actually funded by Patreon contributions
[02:33.080 --> 02:35.640]  that was covered just a couple of years ago.
[02:35.640 --> 02:40.400]  Recently I've noticed that my MacBook is acting a little bit funny and it is also warped on
[02:40.400 --> 02:41.400]  the bottom.
[02:41.400 --> 02:42.400]  I don't know how that happened.
[02:42.400 --> 02:44.640]  I don't know what does that, but it is starting to bubble.
[02:44.640 --> 02:47.360]  So it is almost time to replace this MacBook.
[02:47.360 --> 02:48.680]  That will not be stressful.
[02:48.680 --> 02:49.840]  That will not be a problem.
[02:49.840 --> 02:54.480]  There will be no issue because my friends from Patreon have helped out so well that
[02:54.480 --> 02:58.440]  I'll just be able to go to the computer place and say, I need a new computer and it will
[02:58.440 --> 03:01.240]  be covered through my friends on Patreon.
[03:01.240 --> 03:05.800]  So big thanks and big shout out for all of the continued Patreon support.
[03:05.800 --> 03:09.520]  If you are not supporting the show on Patreon and you would like to learn how to do so,
[03:09.520 --> 03:16.120]  all you need to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:16.120 --> 03:19.040]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[03:19.040 --> 03:25.360]  I do not think you can go to the Patreon homepage and actually search for the podcast in the
[03:25.360 --> 03:26.360]  search bar.
[03:26.360 --> 03:31.000]  I think you actually have to type in www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:31.000 --> 03:37.160]  They don't allow us to come up in their search bar because we are cannabis content providers,
[03:37.160 --> 03:39.060]  but they haven't banned us from the service.
[03:39.060 --> 03:40.280]  So I don't complain.
[03:40.280 --> 03:44.560]  You just have to type in the full URL or I've made it easy for you.
[03:44.560 --> 03:47.460]  I have included a link in the show notes.
[03:47.460 --> 03:51.920]  So if you're listening on Apple podcasts or on Stitcher radio or on Google play or whatever
[03:51.920 --> 03:56.280]  podcast service you're listening to, click on the show, scroll down, find the show notes,
[03:56.280 --> 03:59.960]  and there will be a link to the Patreon campaign in the notes.
[03:59.960 --> 04:04.420]  I have also included the link in the video description on YouTube.
[04:04.420 --> 04:09.200]  So once again, big thank you, big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[04:09.200 --> 04:13.500]  I am trying to make it easy for everybody to support the show because I do get at least
[04:13.500 --> 04:18.580]  one email every week saying, Hey, I'm looking for the show, cannot find it on Patreon.
[04:18.580 --> 04:19.580]  What do I do?
[04:19.580 --> 04:20.580]  It is real easy.
[04:20.580 --> 04:24.820]  Simply follow the link in the show notes or the video description.
[04:24.820 --> 04:25.820]  All right.
[04:25.820 --> 04:29.780]  The next order of business I have gotten written down is to apologize for my stuffy nose.
[04:29.780 --> 04:31.300]  I sound like I've got a stuffy nose.
[04:31.300 --> 04:34.100]  I sound like, kind of sound like I'm talking a little bit like this.
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.140]  It is worth it.
[04:35.140 --> 04:37.020]  It is all for good cause.
[04:37.020 --> 04:41.900]  This evening I walked into the flower room where I've got a male plant who is just dumping
[04:41.900 --> 04:46.340]  pollen and I gave him a nice little tap, a nice little flick, and I let all that pollen
[04:46.340 --> 04:49.320]  go flying around all over a bunch of lovely ladies.
[04:49.320 --> 04:53.940]  So there has been a successful phase one pollination that happened today.
[04:53.940 --> 04:58.180]  I will do another pollination in three to five days, depending on how the male and the
[04:58.180 --> 05:00.060]  female plants look.
[05:00.060 --> 05:03.100]  Then once all that pollen is shaken out, I'll collect a little bit of it.
[05:03.100 --> 05:04.820]  I may store some of it properly.
[05:04.820 --> 05:07.260]  We'll talk about pollen storage in another episode.
[05:07.260 --> 05:10.940]  That's not what we're here for today, but I may store some of that pollen, then cut
[05:10.940 --> 05:12.360]  down that male.
[05:12.360 --> 05:18.220]  Then we will change the light schedule and in approximately 50 to 70 days, we will have
[05:18.220 --> 05:20.300]  more fresh seeds.
[05:20.300 --> 05:24.120]  Some of the items that have been sold out will be replenished and there may be some
[05:24.120 --> 05:28.020]  new things that need to be tested and tried out before they can go to market.
[05:28.020 --> 05:31.320]  But if I do sound a little bit fuzzy in my voice today, if I sound like I'm on the verge
[05:31.320 --> 05:33.820]  of sneezing, that is absolutely accurate.
[05:33.820 --> 05:38.460]  It is because I played with a male plant and spread a bunch of pollen throughout a room
[05:38.460 --> 05:40.860]  and it is messing me up a little bit today.
[05:41.280 --> 05:43.820]  I can taste it and I can certainly feel it in my face.
[05:43.820 --> 05:45.820]  So I apologize if you can hear it.
[05:45.820 --> 05:49.020]  Now, speaking of pollen rooms, I do have another update for you.
[05:49.020 --> 05:54.060]  A while back, I was talking about replenishing and remaking the TMNT line.
[05:54.060 --> 05:55.820]  Many of you know what I'm talking about.
[05:55.820 --> 05:59.100]  When I say the TMNT line, many of you may be confused.
[05:59.100 --> 06:01.780]  There is a strain in that lineup called Leonardo.
[06:01.780 --> 06:03.580]  There's a strain in there called Raphael.
[06:03.580 --> 06:05.400]  There's a strain called Donatello.
[06:05.400 --> 06:07.060]  There's a strain called Michelangelo.
[06:07.060 --> 06:09.100]  There's a Bebop and a Rocksteady.
[06:09.140 --> 06:14.220]  I may have recently created a strain by the name of Shredder.
[06:14.220 --> 06:16.460]  So I call that the TMNT line.
[06:16.460 --> 06:20.540]  We've got to be careful with some of the words we use, but I am excited to announce that
[06:20.540 --> 06:25.860]  those plants have been harvested and I am slowly getting those packages put together.
[06:25.860 --> 06:31.000]  Many people have been asking for TMNT packages and the best update I have got for you is
[06:31.000 --> 06:32.660]  that the plants have been harvested.
[06:32.660 --> 06:33.660]  They have been dried.
[06:33.660 --> 06:39.080]  They have been crumbled up and the seeds have been removed and a large portion of them have
[06:39.080 --> 06:41.580]  begun the packaging phase.
[06:41.580 --> 06:46.320]  It is just me doing the packaging on these beans, so please be patient.
[06:46.320 --> 06:51.360]  I do all of the seed sorting and packaging by myself, so it does take me a while, but
[06:51.360 --> 06:59.080]  as soon as I am done, these seeds will land at seedsherenow.com and I'll make sure you
[06:59.080 --> 07:01.800]  know that they are there through the podcast.
[07:01.800 --> 07:06.760]  I know a lot of people have been paying attention and waiting for that update and for that announcement,
[07:06.760 --> 07:14.400]  so the best date I can give you is I will have those seeds to the vendors by March 1st.
[07:14.400 --> 07:20.640]  So by March 1st, the TMNT line will be replenished, but do not miss it because they will go very
[07:20.640 --> 07:21.640]  quickly.
[07:21.640 --> 07:26.280]  Make sure you're signed up to all of the seeds here now, text alerts and all of their social
[07:26.280 --> 07:33.880]  media and also that you're on all of my social media so you don't miss the TMNT seed drop.
[07:34.120 --> 07:39.640]  Just a quick heads up, the best place to follow my social media for info on seed drops is
[07:39.640 --> 07:41.080]  on Instagram.
[07:41.080 --> 07:43.400]  Follow irie underscore genetics.
[07:43.400 --> 07:48.480]  Also make sure you follow The Real Seeds Here Now on Instagram.
[07:48.480 --> 07:54.920]  I also suggest you go to seedsherenow.com and sign up for their text message blasts.
[07:54.920 --> 07:59.280]  You will get a lot of great updates and deals through that service.
[07:59.280 --> 08:01.360]  All right, that's enough garden updates.
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.400]  I told you that seeds will be available soon.
[08:03.920 --> 08:05.960]  I told you that I have pollinated another round.
[08:05.960 --> 08:10.600]  We are making great success in the breeding programs in 2020.
[08:10.600 --> 08:12.960]  Thank you for following along.
[08:12.960 --> 08:18.680]  The next thing I should talk about is I recently did an episode about my nutrient mix.
[08:18.680 --> 08:23.240]  I did a very introductory episode that talked about how and why I do many of the things
[08:23.240 --> 08:24.240]  I do.
[08:24.240 --> 08:27.640]  Then I discussed my vegetative nutrient mix.
[08:27.640 --> 08:32.960]  Then I followed that masterpiece up with another episode, which included my flowering nutrient
[08:33.520 --> 08:34.520]  mix.
[08:34.520 --> 08:35.520]  It was very detailed.
[08:35.520 --> 08:36.520]  It was very in-depth.
[08:36.520 --> 08:39.160]  I think I covered most of the necessary details.
[08:39.160 --> 08:45.480]  I did get quite a few messages, emails, and comments and questions after I posted those
[08:45.480 --> 08:46.880]  episodes.
[08:46.880 --> 08:53.960]  One of the most common questions was, why don't you list your PPMs and your pH in each
[08:53.960 --> 08:54.960]  week?
[08:54.960 --> 08:57.160]  Now, I do mention the pH quite often.
[08:57.160 --> 09:03.520]  I say that through flower, I generally recommend we keep our pH between 6.2 and 6.4.
[09:03.520 --> 09:05.120]  That is a great range for our plants.
[09:05.120 --> 09:10.480]  You have to adjust to each specific plant, possibly each specific phenotype.
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.760]  But I do believe that 6.2 to 6.4 will work for most plants in most gardens.
[09:15.760 --> 09:20.160]  If you've got a lot of plants, you can find that most of them will be happy within that
[09:20.160 --> 09:21.160]  range.
[09:21.160 --> 09:22.800]  I did mention that a couple of times.
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.920]  I didn't feel like I needed to say that on every week's mix details.
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.960]  If you go back and listen, you will hear that I say a lot of times 6.2 to 6.4 is the recommended
[09:34.960 --> 09:40.280]  pH if you are running cocoa or a soilless mix and you are running the nutrient mix,
[09:40.280 --> 09:41.280]  which I suggested.
[09:41.280 --> 09:45.160]  Again, that mix that I recommend is only going to work in cocoa.
[09:45.160 --> 09:47.000]  Don't do that every day in a soilless mix.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.260]  You'll burn your plants.
[09:48.260 --> 09:49.260]  You can do that.
[09:49.260 --> 09:50.260]  Just break it down.
[09:50.260 --> 09:53.420]  You'll need waterings without all that nutrients in between.
[09:53.420 --> 09:54.540]  Now I'm rambling.
[09:54.540 --> 09:55.760]  Let's stay focused.
[09:55.760 --> 10:01.740]  The other thing people wanted to know is why don't I mention the EC or the PPMs of my specific
[10:01.740 --> 10:03.540]  mix each week?
[10:03.540 --> 10:10.060]  If you listen to both episodes, you'll remember that I said I do not use reverse osmosis water.
[10:10.060 --> 10:13.780]  I don't find it necessary where I am because we've got good water.
[10:13.780 --> 10:14.940]  You may need it where you are.
[10:14.940 --> 10:15.940]  You may not.
[10:15.940 --> 10:16.940]  That is up to you.
[10:16.940 --> 10:19.940]  I don't want to waste that much water if it's not necessary.
[10:20.620 --> 10:21.620]  Water is expensive.
[10:21.620 --> 10:22.620]  Water is limited.
[10:22.620 --> 10:23.900]  We don't have unlimited water.
[10:23.900 --> 10:25.460]  One day we will run out of water.
[10:25.460 --> 10:27.900]  I don't want to see that world, but it will happen one day.
[10:27.900 --> 10:33.260]  I don't want to fuck up and waste too much water, so I don't use the RO unnecessarily,
[10:33.260 --> 10:40.220]  which means that my starting PPMs and my starting EC are quite possibly very different than
[10:40.220 --> 10:41.940]  your starting numbers.
[10:41.940 --> 10:44.660]  I don't know what is in your municipal water.
[10:44.660 --> 10:46.420]  I don't know what's in your well water.
[10:46.420 --> 10:48.100]  I don't know what is in your tap water.
[10:48.100 --> 10:51.100]  I don't know what is in whatever water you were using.
[10:51.100 --> 10:53.060]  We have different water sources.
[10:53.060 --> 10:58.980]  So if we are 250 PPMs off when we start, our math is not going to add up.
[10:58.980 --> 11:00.860]  Now I could have done a simple calculation.
[11:00.860 --> 11:04.860]  I could have filled up a container of water and I could have checked my PPMs there and
[11:04.860 --> 11:08.340]  see what I start with, and then I could have gone back and done the whole nutrient mix
[11:08.340 --> 11:11.180]  and measure the PPMs and tell you what I ended with.
[11:11.180 --> 11:16.620]  But if I only missed one detail in that episode, I am not mad at myself that that is the thing
[11:16.620 --> 11:17.620]  I skipped.
[11:17.620 --> 11:19.620]  I feel like I did a pretty good job on that episode.
[11:19.620 --> 11:27.140]  So I apologize that I did not include the EC or the PPM of the nutrient solutions.
[11:27.140 --> 11:31.860]  I have been mixing these mixes for quite a while in quite a few rooms and I have written
[11:31.860 --> 11:35.540]  down the EC and the mix quite a few times.
[11:35.540 --> 11:43.540]  And I do remember off the top of my head that we generally stay within the 1.7 to 1.9 EC
[11:43.540 --> 11:44.540]  range.
[11:44.540 --> 11:50.620]  But sometimes, very rarely, we will get up near the 2.1 EC range.
[11:50.620 --> 11:55.520]  And that also is going to vary based on which method you choose to use.
[11:55.520 --> 11:57.920]  Are you using the Monday Big Mix?
[11:57.920 --> 11:59.720]  Are you mixing everything all at once?
[11:59.720 --> 12:01.140]  Are you adding boosts?
[12:01.140 --> 12:03.160]  That is going to make a difference.
[12:03.160 --> 12:07.980]  Everything you add in will absolutely change your EC and your PPMs.
[12:07.980 --> 12:09.220]  So that is my update.
[12:09.220 --> 12:10.560]  That is my disclaimer.
[12:10.560 --> 12:17.180]  And that is my apology for not including the EC or the PPMs in my nutrient mix episode.
[12:17.180 --> 12:22.500]  All right, podcast world, let's segue into the email portion of this show.
[12:22.500 --> 12:26.460]  If you've got a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question and you would like to
[12:26.460 --> 12:28.460]  ask me, I would love to hear from you.
[12:28.460 --> 12:33.200]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[12:33.200 --> 12:38.860]  The first email on today's episode comes from my friend, Giant Mike from Cannabuzz, and
[12:38.860 --> 12:41.260]  it goes a lot like this.
[12:41.260 --> 12:43.460]  Yo, Rasta Jeff.
[12:43.460 --> 12:48.280]  I wrote to you last year around 420 to talk about what 420 means to me, and it was about
[12:48.280 --> 12:49.280]  my mother.
[12:49.280 --> 12:54.020]  Then, I recently met you at the Indo Expo, and I want to compliment you again on your
[12:54.020 --> 12:57.100]  professionalism at the Indo Expo.
[12:57.100 --> 13:02.780]  I remember exactly who you are, and the moment I read this email, I remembered this situation,
[13:02.780 --> 13:03.780]  and it meant a lot to me.
[13:03.780 --> 13:04.780]  It was a great moment.
[13:04.780 --> 13:06.460]  I'm glad somebody else saw it.
[13:06.460 --> 13:07.460]  Let's keep reading.
[13:07.460 --> 13:12.060]  It says, you probably don't remember me because I'm sure it happened more than once, but I
[13:12.060 --> 13:17.020]  was directly behind what appeared to be, and then he describes a couple of friends of mine.
[13:17.020 --> 13:18.380]  We don't have to go into a full description.
[13:18.380 --> 13:21.860]  I don't know if they want to be described on the podcast.
[13:21.860 --> 13:23.780]  He was standing directly behind friends of mine.
[13:23.780 --> 13:24.780]  He gives a good description.
[13:24.780 --> 13:28.660]  It says, but you were trying to handle business, and they kept thanking you for everything
[13:28.660 --> 13:33.340]  you do and reached over the table at the booth and tried to give you a big hug.
[13:33.340 --> 13:35.740]  Yes, I remember that exact moment.
[13:35.740 --> 13:37.140]  Those are good friends of mine.
[13:37.820 --> 13:40.700]  They are very huge supporters of iRegenetics.
[13:40.700 --> 13:44.860]  I'm pretty sure they listen to this podcast, and they make sure to come say hi to me at
[13:44.860 --> 13:48.940]  every single cannabis industry event in Colorado.
[13:48.940 --> 13:53.100]  If there is an event and I'm there, I can rely on my friends to come give me a high
[13:53.100 --> 13:54.100]  five and a hug.
[13:54.100 --> 13:56.300]  I know exactly who you're talking about.
[13:56.300 --> 14:00.940]  Great folks, a little tiny short couple, good friends of mine, super sweet people.
[14:00.940 --> 14:04.020]  I love that they are a couple, that they both interact with me.
[14:04.020 --> 14:08.660]  A lot of times when you go to a cannabis event or a cannabis industry sort of thing,
[14:08.660 --> 14:12.020]  it's a bunch of dudes and a bunch of bros talking to each other, and the girlfriends
[14:12.020 --> 14:14.460]  look like they're getting drug along by their boyfriends.
[14:14.460 --> 14:19.420]  I always make sure to politely and in a friendly way say hi to the girlfriends to make sure
[14:19.420 --> 14:22.180]  they can be included in the event as well.
[14:22.180 --> 14:24.180]  This couple always shows up as equals.
[14:24.180 --> 14:25.960]  They've both got a big smile on their face.
[14:25.960 --> 14:28.180]  They're both equally as excited to be at the event.
[14:28.180 --> 14:30.180]  They're both equally excited to see me.
[14:30.180 --> 14:32.820]  So I love it when a couple comes to the booth like that.
[14:32.820 --> 14:34.940]  Let's get my stoned ass back on track.
[14:34.940 --> 14:38.100]  It says, I've been a car salesman for 15 years.
[14:38.100 --> 14:41.820]  From time to time, people will get excited about their car and want to hug their salesman
[14:41.820 --> 14:44.780]  or saleswomen and even try to kiss us.
[14:44.780 --> 14:48.900]  I know that awkward feeling, and I get how to handle them by sidestepping them and changing
[14:48.900 --> 14:52.620]  the flow of conversation to move on and make them forget about it.
[14:52.620 --> 14:54.780]  But you surprised me, Rasta Jeff.
[14:54.780 --> 14:59.700]  You actually came out of your booth and walked around and gave them a hug and took a picture
[14:59.700 --> 15:00.700]  with them.
[15:00.700 --> 15:03.740]  I think you are a class act for that.
[15:03.740 --> 15:06.580]  Hey, I'm really glad that you caught that moment.
[15:06.580 --> 15:09.540]  I'm really glad I got to take that photo with my friends.
[15:09.540 --> 15:10.540]  And that's what it's all about.
[15:10.540 --> 15:12.860]  I was at the Indo Expo with a booth.
[15:12.860 --> 15:14.860]  I was there in a business mode.
[15:14.860 --> 15:18.860]  But when I see my friends, I want to make sure to stop and give my friends a high five
[15:18.860 --> 15:20.460]  or a handshake or a hug.
[15:20.460 --> 15:24.860]  I really made sure to try to connect with everybody that came to my booth that weekend.
[15:24.860 --> 15:26.840]  I stuck my hand out and said, I'm Jeff.
[15:26.840 --> 15:27.940]  What is your name?
[15:27.940 --> 15:32.900]  I try to treat everybody like they're one of my best friends and also like they are
[15:32.900 --> 15:36.740]  one of the most important people on the planet because they are.
[15:36.740 --> 15:39.780]  I like to treat people how I expect to be treated.
[15:39.780 --> 15:40.780]  That's with kindness.
[15:40.780 --> 15:41.780]  That's with friendship.
[15:41.780 --> 15:42.780]  That's with respect.
[15:42.780 --> 15:45.540]  All that stuff that we expect, I try to give that as well.
[15:45.540 --> 15:46.620]  And I'm getting it in return.
[15:46.620 --> 15:48.300]  The world is giving that back to me.
[15:48.300 --> 15:51.520]  So I do try to shake people's hands and look them in the eye.
[15:51.520 --> 15:54.620]  Of course, I had a long weekend and I was heavily medicated.
[15:54.620 --> 15:55.700]  So there's a little bit of that.
[15:55.700 --> 15:58.020]  You miss a little bit of that personal connection because of that.
[15:58.020 --> 16:03.140]  But I do my best to be present and say hi to everybody because they're not there just
[16:03.140 --> 16:04.140]  to purchase seeds.
[16:04.140 --> 16:05.420]  They want to meet me.
[16:05.420 --> 16:06.460]  They want to shake my hand.
[16:06.460 --> 16:10.180]  They've learned a lot from me and it means a lot to them to return the energy.
[16:10.180 --> 16:11.580]  They want to give me a hug and thank me.
[16:11.580 --> 16:12.580]  And it means a lot.
[16:12.580 --> 16:16.660]  So I appreciate that you noticed that, that somebody actually caught me coming out from
[16:16.660 --> 16:19.200]  behind my booth and hugging my friends.
[16:19.200 --> 16:20.200]  They're not my customers.
[16:20.200 --> 16:21.200]  Those are my friends.
[16:21.200 --> 16:22.200]  That's my community.
[16:22.200 --> 16:23.200]  And thank you.
[16:23.200 --> 16:24.200]  I'm glad you caught that.
[16:24.200 --> 16:26.040]  I'm going to pause this email because I'm getting all gushy here.
[16:26.040 --> 16:27.040]  It says, I don't know.
[16:27.040 --> 16:31.120]  I guess it's the little things like that we really don't think about, but people notice
[16:31.120 --> 16:36.160]  and something so small can make people start drinking the Irie Genetics Kool-Aid.
[16:36.160 --> 16:38.680]  Hey, I don't have any Kool-Aid to spill, man.
[16:38.680 --> 16:43.120]  I hope that everybody just follows along because I'm doing a good positive thing.
[16:43.120 --> 16:47.800]  I feel like we're a seed breeders and the cannabis community, we're kind of like a band.
[16:47.800 --> 16:51.120]  There are different breeders that do different things, that have different styles.
[16:51.120 --> 16:53.120]  And if you're into their music, you'll listen to them.
[16:53.120 --> 16:57.200]  I try to put out some positive music, a positive vibe, a positive brand.
[16:57.200 --> 17:00.200]  I try to be reliable and honest, and I think it's working.
[17:00.200 --> 17:03.360]  Just being me is working the best that it can.
[17:03.360 --> 17:07.160]  It has taken a while to get here, but it is really starting to show.
[17:07.160 --> 17:08.680]  So let's continue with the message.
[17:08.680 --> 17:13.320]  It says, I've been drinking the Irie Kool-Aid for a few years now, but other people noticed
[17:13.320 --> 17:14.600]  it too.
[17:14.600 --> 17:19.120]  And many people behind me were shocked that you came out from behind the booth.
[17:19.120 --> 17:20.640]  Man, again, that's what I'm there for.
[17:20.640 --> 17:22.320]  I'm not some sort of...
[17:22.320 --> 17:23.640]  There's no ivory tower.
[17:23.640 --> 17:25.120]  There's no sort of invisible fence.
[17:25.120 --> 17:26.120]  There's nothing like that.
[17:26.120 --> 17:27.120]  Come give me a hug.
[17:27.120 --> 17:28.120]  Come say hi.
[17:28.120 --> 17:29.120]  Come shake my hand.
[17:29.120 --> 17:30.120]  Come give me a high five.
[17:30.120 --> 17:31.200]  I'm a really friendly dude.
[17:31.200 --> 17:32.920]  I like to meet the people.
[17:32.920 --> 17:36.560]  All of that thanks and all of those hugs, that's what recharges me.
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.560]  I do make a little bit of Patreon funding from this podcast, but that covers the computer
[17:41.560 --> 17:43.080]  and a few costs.
[17:43.080 --> 17:48.540]  Those hugs, those high fives, those good jobs, all of that stuff, that is what recharges
[17:48.540 --> 17:50.980]  my soul, recharges my spirit.
[17:50.980 --> 17:55.340]  That's what keeps me able to just ramble into a microphone and share my passion with you.
[17:55.340 --> 17:56.700]  So thank you for that.
[17:56.700 --> 17:57.700]  Thank you for noticing.
[17:57.700 --> 17:59.280]  There is so much more to this message.
[17:59.280 --> 18:03.660]  This person also says, sorry, I'm kind of rambling, but my point is keep up the good
[18:03.660 --> 18:04.660]  work.
[18:04.660 --> 18:06.800]  You represent you and your company very well.
[18:06.800 --> 18:07.800]  Thank you.
[18:07.800 --> 18:08.800]  I appreciate that.
[18:08.800 --> 18:11.220]  It is great that somebody at an event caught that.
[18:11.220 --> 18:13.100]  It was just me being myself.
[18:13.100 --> 18:14.380]  So that is a huge compliment.
[18:14.380 --> 18:15.660]  Now here's another part.
[18:15.660 --> 18:19.420]  The last paragraph of this email reads just like this.
[18:19.420 --> 18:24.500]  It says, I'm sure you were getting flooded with questions about that mix episode.
[18:24.500 --> 18:26.760]  My question is really short.
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.420]  It says, I noticed you did not mention Mammoth Pea.
[18:30.420 --> 18:33.420]  Have you not gotten good results from Mammoth Pea?
[18:33.420 --> 18:36.340]  I am on the fence with it only because of the cost.
[18:36.340 --> 18:39.360]  I start using it the week before I flip my plants.
[18:39.360 --> 18:44.260]  I have been long awaiting your mix episode to hear if you use it and your take on it.
[18:44.260 --> 18:48.380]  I'm going to jump in right there and say, I do love Mammoth Pea.
[18:48.380 --> 18:49.420]  It is a great product.
[18:49.420 --> 18:53.060]  If you guys aren't familiar with Mammoth Pea, give it a quick Google, check it out.
[18:53.060 --> 18:54.580]  It is a great product.
[18:54.580 --> 19:00.740]  However, we agreed in the commercial facilities that it is not cost-effective.
[19:00.740 --> 19:02.580]  I am not trying to bash Mammoth Pea.
[19:02.580 --> 19:07.020]  I don't have anything negative to say about Mammoth Pea, except when you were trying to
[19:07.020 --> 19:13.040]  convince an investor and an owner that you need to spend that type of money on one bottle,
[19:13.040 --> 19:16.000]  they do get sticker shock.
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.060]  And in a commercial environment, we need to order a lot of Mammoth Pea.
[19:20.060 --> 19:24.200]  So we opted to not use the Mammoth Pea in the commercial environments.
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.200]  And honestly, the plants look extremely happy.
[19:27.200 --> 19:32.280]  So we have opted to not use it in the commercial environment, like you said, mainly for the
[19:32.280 --> 19:33.840]  cost.
[19:33.840 --> 19:39.200]  Another small reason why we don't use Mammoth Pea is basically a logistics issue.
[19:39.200 --> 19:42.600]  We buy most of our products from one warehouse.
[19:42.600 --> 19:44.200]  Everything comes on one truck.
[19:44.200 --> 19:48.320]  It's really easy just to go down the sheet and order all of the things we need.
[19:48.320 --> 19:52.380]  And unfortunately, that warehouse does not carry Mammoth Pea.
[19:52.380 --> 19:56.520]  So with the product already being a little bit not cost-effective, and then it's not
[19:56.520 --> 20:00.760]  carried by my normal distributor, I don't make an extra order to add that product to
[20:00.760 --> 20:01.760]  my lineup.
[20:01.760 --> 20:06.000]  So those are two solid reasons why I'm not using Mammoth Pea in a commercial grow.
[20:06.000 --> 20:09.400]  Again, let me reiterate, I don't want to bash Mammoth Pea.
[20:09.400 --> 20:11.160]  There is nothing wrong with Mammoth Pea.
[20:11.160 --> 20:12.600]  It is a wonderful product.
[20:12.600 --> 20:18.680]  I have seen explosive root growth when Mammoth Pea is added in the early phases, and I have
[20:18.680 --> 20:23.800]  seen giant, fat, tasty buds when Mammoth Pea is added in later phases.
[20:23.800 --> 20:27.160]  I do like to add Mammoth Pea in my personal grows.
[20:27.160 --> 20:32.280]  I absolutely like to use Mammoth Pea in my breeding projects, but those are my personal
[20:32.280 --> 20:35.920]  grows where I am in charge of all the nutrients, all the budgeting.
[20:35.920 --> 20:37.120]  Everything is up to me.
[20:37.120 --> 20:40.120]  So in those situations, I do apply Mammoth Pea.
[20:40.120 --> 20:43.720]  I'm also funding a much smaller personal garden.
[20:43.720 --> 20:47.920]  I don't have to buy several five-gallon bottles of Mammoth Pea.
[20:47.920 --> 20:50.560]  So in my personal grows, I like the Mammoth Pea.
[20:50.560 --> 20:57.080]  In my breeding program, I certainly add Mammoth Pea, and I do notice that my seeds look fatter,
[20:57.080 --> 21:02.720]  fuller, and healthier when I use the Mammoth Pea in my personal breeding projects.
[21:02.720 --> 21:04.520]  So that's the first part of that question.
[21:04.520 --> 21:09.920]  I basically don't use Mammoth Pea in the commercial grow because it is very expensive and it is
[21:09.920 --> 21:13.000]  also not available from my main distributor.
[21:13.000 --> 21:18.480]  So I'd have to pay another $100 to $150 to have a truck deliver me another pallet of
[21:18.480 --> 21:20.640]  another very expensive product.
[21:20.640 --> 21:23.000]  So we just decided to skip that step.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  And honestly, the plants look beautiful.
[21:25.000 --> 21:26.400]  The plants are very happy.
[21:26.400 --> 21:28.040]  So they're not missing anything.
[21:28.040 --> 21:30.180]  They don't even know they're not getting it.
[21:30.180 --> 21:32.000]  There is a little bit more to this question.
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  It goes on.
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.820]  It says, honestly, everyone else I know in Colorado uses Mammoth Pea or ReCharge or both.
[21:39.820 --> 21:44.060]  So I was shocked to not hear either on the mix episodes.
[21:44.060 --> 21:47.060]  Is Plus Life really that good?
[21:47.060 --> 21:49.340]  Then they sign it with, thanks for your time.
[21:49.340 --> 21:50.820]  Giant Mike from Cannabuzz.
[21:50.820 --> 21:53.860]  Hey, Giant Mike, thank you for the great message.
[21:53.860 --> 21:57.940]  Let's talk more about Plus Life and ReCharge.
[21:57.940 --> 22:01.940]  Everybody knows I'm a good friend and a big fan of Scotty Real.
[22:01.940 --> 22:04.380]  Scotty Real, of course, is Real Growers.
[22:04.380 --> 22:06.940]  Real Growers is who makes ReCharge.
[22:06.940 --> 22:09.540]  Big shout out to my buddy, Scotty Real and Guru.
[22:09.540 --> 22:14.220]  While I'm at it, let's give a big shout out to the dude and also the entire DGC crew.
[22:14.220 --> 22:15.460]  Gang, gang.
[22:15.460 --> 22:16.780]  Scotty Real is my buddy.
[22:16.780 --> 22:18.500]  Scotty Real makes ReCharge.
[22:18.500 --> 22:21.940]  I should be using ReCharge in my commercial environments.
[22:21.940 --> 22:26.940]  Unfortunately, my distributor does not carry ReCharge at their big warehouse.
[22:26.940 --> 22:30.540]  So once again, it's not available at my main distributor.
[22:30.540 --> 22:32.420]  ReCharge is a great product.
[22:32.420 --> 22:34.380]  ReCharge is cost effective.
[22:34.380 --> 22:37.620]  I will say that it is cost effective.
[22:37.620 --> 22:40.860]  I like to use ReCharge in my personal grows.
[22:40.860 --> 22:43.780]  Scotty makes sure that I never run out of ReCharge.
[22:43.780 --> 22:46.660]  Once again, thank you, Scotty, for always taking good care of me.
[22:46.660 --> 22:53.140]  I like ReCharge once a week at 2.5 grams of ReCharge per gallon of water.
[22:53.140 --> 22:55.980]  Once a week, I feed every plant ReCharge.
[22:55.980 --> 23:01.460]  It goes in whatever I'm mixing in Monday, every week, ReCharge goes in there for every
[23:01.460 --> 23:02.460]  plant.
[23:02.460 --> 23:03.460]  ReCharge is a great product.
[23:03.540 --> 23:11.060]  Again, it's not sold through my major supplier that distributes for my commercial environments.
[23:11.060 --> 23:17.220]  So that is honestly the main determining factor of why I do not use ReCharge in my commercial
[23:17.220 --> 23:21.900]  grows and why it was not included in my nutrient mix episode.
[23:21.900 --> 23:24.100]  I love Scotty Real.
[23:24.100 --> 23:25.580]  I love ReCharge.
[23:25.580 --> 23:26.580]  That shit is awesome.
[23:26.580 --> 23:32.100]  I did not include it because it is not available through my vendor and through my distributor.
[23:32.100 --> 23:34.100]  I recommend it in my personal grow.
[23:34.100 --> 23:35.340]  I use it all the time.
[23:35.340 --> 23:39.740]  I recommend it for your personal grow or your commercial grow as well.
[23:39.740 --> 23:41.380]  Big shout out to ReCharge.
[23:41.380 --> 23:42.380]  Great product.
[23:42.380 --> 23:45.020]  There is absolutely no reason to not use it.
[23:45.020 --> 23:48.460]  There are a million and one reasons why you should use it.
[23:48.460 --> 23:53.420]  Now, the last part of this email is, is Plus Life really that good?
[23:53.420 --> 23:58.780]  Yes, I do believe that Plus Life is a quality product that is cost effective and it is doing
[23:58.780 --> 24:02.820]  exactly what I expect it to and it works as advertised.
[24:02.820 --> 24:06.600]  So yes, I do think that Plus Life is that good of a product.
[24:06.600 --> 24:10.940]  And since I'm already using the VegBloom base, I'm using the booster, which is Shine.
[24:10.940 --> 24:13.140]  I'm using the foliar feed, which is Push.
[24:13.140 --> 24:17.740]  I feel like it works very well just to go ahead and round out the recipe with the Plus
[24:17.740 --> 24:18.740]  Life.
[24:18.740 --> 24:24.660]  So that is a quick rundown of why I did not include Mammoth Pea or ReCharge in my nutrient
[24:24.660 --> 24:26.020]  mix episodes.
[24:26.020 --> 24:27.820]  There is nothing wrong with those products.
[24:27.860 --> 24:29.060]  They are great products.
[24:29.060 --> 24:32.940]  That is just not what I'm doing in my commercial environment at this time.
[24:32.940 --> 24:37.860]  I told you I was going to be completely honest with you and tell you what I use and I honestly
[24:37.860 --> 24:41.940]  am not using those products in my commercial environment at this time.
[24:41.940 --> 24:48.380]  I am using ReCharge in my personal grow all the time and I like to use Mammoth Pea in
[24:48.380 --> 24:55.340]  my flowering plants that are seeded because my seeds do show to be fatter, they're rounder,
[24:55.340 --> 24:59.980]  they're harder and they finish even sooner when I use the Mammoth Pea.
[24:59.980 --> 25:04.140]  So once again, big shout out to my friends at Mammoth Pea and also giant shout out to
[25:04.140 --> 25:07.560]  my buddy Scotty Real and Real Growers.
[25:07.560 --> 25:11.280]  Also let's send one more giant shout out to my buddy Giant Mike from Cannabuzz.

[28:48.860 --> 28:52.240]  I have to cry.
[28:52.240 --> 28:56.960]  Oh yes, let me get my words right.

[29:02.020 --> 29:04.720]  You'll never have to cry.
[29:04.720 --> 29:05.720]  No.
[29:05.720 --> 29:12.180]  I know everyone can relate to when they find a special someone.
[29:12.180 --> 29:15.180]  She's royal.
[29:15.180 --> 29:19.180]  I know the king and queen crown same time
[29:19.180 --> 29:22.180]  So I never leave his side
[29:22.180 --> 29:25.180]  Just stick with me through the trial times
[29:25.180 --> 29:28.180]  And she say she no mine
[29:28.180 --> 29:31.180]  A right a no good man is hard to find
[29:31.180 --> 29:34.180]  And she canna not bad a jive no line
[29:34.180 --> 29:37.180]  That's why she has no ties at this time
[29:37.180 --> 29:42.180]  I know many men are trying
[29:42.180 --> 29:45.180]  But she needs to be more than wine and dime
[29:45.180 --> 29:51.180]  Because she's royal, yeah, so royal
[29:51.180 --> 29:57.180]  And I want her in my life
[29:57.180 --> 30:02.180]  I never knew anyone so divine
[30:02.180 --> 30:07.180]  Oh, the way she moves, warobi
[30:07.180 --> 30:12.180]  She has the qualities of a queen
[30:12.180 --> 30:17.180]  So supreme, ooh, ooh
[30:17.180 --> 30:22.180]  But natural beauty, no need no make-up to be a cutie
[30:22.180 --> 30:28.180]  She's a queen, so supreme, yeah
[30:28.180 --> 30:31.180]  And when they ask what a good woman's made of
[30:31.180 --> 30:35.180]  She's not afraid and ashamed of who she is
[30:35.180 --> 30:40.180]  She's royal, yeah, so royal
[30:40.180 --> 30:45.180]  And I want her in my life
[30:45.180 --> 30:51.180]  I never knew anyone so one of a kind
[30:51.180 --> 30:55.180]  No, no, the way she moves, warobi
[30:55.180 --> 31:00.180]  She has the qualities of a queen
[31:01.180 --> 31:04.180]  My beauty and queen
[31:04.180 --> 31:08.180]  Ooh, ooh, what a natural beauty
