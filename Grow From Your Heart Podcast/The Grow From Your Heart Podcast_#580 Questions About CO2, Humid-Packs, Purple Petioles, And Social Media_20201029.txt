[00:59.370 --> 01:03.190]  Welcome to the show podcast world. It is time for episode 580 of the grow from your
[01:03.190 --> 01:07.270]  heart podcast. You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking
[01:07.270 --> 01:13.650]  today. I've been taking dabs of TKD number 10 live batter. This is a blend of chem D
[01:13.650 --> 01:18.970]  and triangle cush. I've been trying to take a dab and experience the flavor before I read
[01:18.970 --> 01:23.310]  the label and let the label influence my mouth. I took a dab and I said, wow, that tastes
[01:23.310 --> 01:29.130]  like OG cush and sour moth balls. Then I read the label and it says the flavor should taste
[01:29.170 --> 01:34.490]  like sour, petrol and lemon. So there's kind of a cushy description in there and the sour
[01:34.490 --> 01:38.850]  part fell in, but I got a sour cushy moth ball, which may not sound like the most pleasant
[01:38.850 --> 01:42.770]  description unless you're a cush connoisseur and that is fucking delicious. I loved it.
[01:42.770 --> 01:47.370]  It was tremendous. I expected it to be more of a kind of a punch to the face, kind of
[01:47.370 --> 01:51.210]  lay me down a little bit. Honestly, it made me kind of, kind of go. It got me moving.
[01:51.210 --> 01:55.050]  It got me chatty. I was organizing my recording space here real nice. You ever smoke those
[01:55.050 --> 01:58.730]  kind of concentrates? You're like, I'm going to record a podcast. Next thing you know,
[01:58.730 --> 02:02.370]  you're not recording anything. You're fucking organizing your space and checking your Facebook
[02:02.370 --> 02:10.250]  and looking at Instagram is that kind of concentrate. So big shout out to the T K D number 10 live
[02:10.250 --> 02:14.290]  batter for making a great podcast happen. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, in this episode,
[02:14.290 --> 02:19.370]  I'm going to read a couple of Patreon messages and emails before we get there. Let's do a
[02:19.370 --> 02:25.010]  few shout outs to a few members of the seven 10 club. Of course the seven 10 club, excuse
[02:25.010 --> 02:29.210]  me. I'm all choked up about the seven 10 club. Thank you guys. I love your support.
[02:29.210 --> 02:33.690]  Anyway, the seven 10 club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7 and 10 cent

[02:49.410 --> 02:53.530]  grower. Big shout out to our Canadian friends. Thank you for listening up there. Let's follow
[02:53.530 --> 02:57.970]  that one up with a big grow from your heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out to ill tempered
[02:57.970 --> 03:02.810]  sea bass. I get a lot of cool names in here and that one will never leave my brain and
[03:02.810 --> 03:07.050]  ill tempered sea bass. I just see a giant pissed off sea bass. I may be not pissed off,
[03:07.050 --> 03:11.050]  but ill tempered is the right word. Uh, can't smoke weed if you're a sea bass cause you're
[03:11.050 --> 03:14.330]  goddamn underwater. Maybe you can. I don't know. Maybe you got some tech. I don't know
[03:14.330 --> 03:18.410]  about shout me out. If you do, if you've got that underwater smoke tech for our sea bass
[03:18.410 --> 03:21.850]  friend, we could tell him the fuck out. Let me know. Let's follow this one up with a big
[03:22.010 --> 03:26.090]  from your heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out to black Hawks fan. I don't know enough
[03:26.090 --> 03:30.250]  about hockey to have any jokes, but go avalanche. Cause I'm in Colorado. That's what I'm supposed
[03:30.250 --> 03:34.770]  to say. Uh, let's follow that up with a big shout out to Omar T let's follow that one
[03:34.770 --> 03:38.610]  up with a big grow from your heart podcast. Thank you. Shout out to gangster and last,

[03:43.370 --> 03:48.690]  J G big thank you. And big shout out to everybody who supports the podcast on Patrion. If you're
[03:48.690 --> 03:51.970]  not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so all you have to
[03:51.970 --> 03:58.010]  do is visit www.patrion.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information
[03:58.010 --> 04:01.290]  you need will be right there on the screen. And of course I did include a link in the
[04:01.290 --> 04:06.250]  show notes and in the video description to make it easy for all of my friends. If you
[04:06.250 --> 04:09.090]  see me playing with the camera, it's because when I did that fist bump toward the camera,
[04:09.090 --> 04:12.770]  it really messed up the lighting here, trying to undo that, redo that. There we go. I think
[04:12.770 --> 04:16.890]  I may have fixed it. That was funny to me. You got to watch the video to see what happened.
[04:16.890 --> 04:20.890]  I fist bumped at the camera and the lighting went to shit. Hopefully it'll re auto-focus
[04:20.890 --> 04:26.050]  for me using the Mac book. I do promise you if there are improvements coming, um, where
[04:26.050 --> 04:30.010]  else are we going to go from here? Those are the shout outs. Follow us on Patreon. Thank
[04:30.010 --> 04:34.290]  you. Let's not waste too much time. Let's get to the email portion of this podcast.
[04:34.290 --> 04:39.010]  I can get quite chatty and quite rambly sometimes. Let's not let too much of that happen. The
[04:39.010 --> 04:43.850]  first message in today's episode comes from our friend, Papa wheelie. What up Papa wheelie?
[04:43.850 --> 04:48.850]  to see you. Haven't heard from you in a minute. This one goes like this. Hey, Ross to Jeff.
[04:48.850 --> 04:53.730]  It's Papa wheelie again. Hey, funny story. Revelant to your outdoor rant episode. Maybe
[04:53.730 --> 04:57.770]  two weeks ago I went on Facebook. Well, that's where you screwed up. So I went on Facebook
[04:57.770 --> 05:02.010]  in a group called cannabis growing and tips, or I think that's the name. Anyway, I don't
[05:02.010 --> 05:07.110]  remember when I joined, but sometimes something in a post catches my eye when I'm on there.
[05:07.110 --> 05:11.570]  There are a lot of Facebook groups that talk about growing cannabis and consuming cannabis.
[05:11.570 --> 05:15.410]  I try to be helpful and encouraging in those groups, but sometimes I have to leave because
[05:15.410 --> 05:20.170]  there are people you can get really, really bad advice in there. And that is a lot of
[05:20.170 --> 05:24.690]  what inspired this podcast. I would see a horrible advice and I said, horrible, you're
[05:24.690 --> 05:29.390]  going to get that H across the screen and horrible. I would see horrible, terrible advice
[05:29.390 --> 05:34.470]  on social media, on forums. Mainly I started in the forums, reading a roll it up and other
[05:34.470 --> 05:38.110]  forums from back in the day. And I would just see people say like, we'll spray that plant
[05:38.110 --> 05:41.830]  with gasoline and I'd be like, wait, what the fuck? And they would mean it. They think
[05:41.830 --> 05:45.070]  that it's a really good thing and they're giving advice. And I think a lot of the advice
[05:45.070 --> 05:49.470]  I saw was going to compound problems. Yeah, it may look like you solved the problem today,
[05:49.470 --> 05:53.950]  but tomorrow you're going to have gasoline flavored buds. So it just drove me crazy.
[05:53.950 --> 05:57.270]  That's a lot of what started this podcast, seeing that shit on Facebook. And I agree
[05:57.270 --> 06:02.630]  with you. It can be tricky to navigate. I want to catch up and fall back into this one.
[06:02.630 --> 06:06.710]  There is more to this. It says, so as soon as someone posts a question and needs, so
[06:06.710 --> 06:10.950]  as soon as someone posts a question and needs help, there are like 20 plus comments almost
[06:10.950 --> 06:16.950]  instantly. Some are the wrong answer. Some are right or ask the right followup questions.
[06:16.950 --> 06:23.190]  But the thing I hate is that 25% of the people talk shit and make fun of the guy or his plants
[06:23.190 --> 06:29.430]  on his first grow or they are just rude. Yeah, it's, it's ridiculous. I try to help people.
[06:29.430 --> 06:33.570]  People get mad at me because I ask questions. I say, well, what was your goal when you fed
[06:33.570 --> 06:38.130]  the plants, fucking humans? I don't know. Would you, whatever you feed the plants? What
[06:38.130 --> 06:40.850]  was your goal when you fed the plants? I just picked humans from Bob's burgers. That's where
[06:40.850 --> 06:43.610]  that came from. If you wondered why I pulled a strange reference, because there were humans
[06:43.610 --> 06:47.530]  in the burgers. But why did you feed your plants? Fucking mushrooms. Why'd you pour
[06:47.530 --> 06:50.050]  kombucha in there? What was your goal? When I asked him that they're like, well, who do
[06:50.050 --> 06:54.090]  you think you are? I'm like, you're on social media asking for grow advice. And I have a
[06:54.090 --> 06:57.310]  lot of it. And I just want to know why you're, what your goal is. And maybe I can steer you
[06:57.310 --> 07:01.810]  in the right direction. But yes, people are confrontational and really ridiculous and
[07:01.810 --> 07:06.690]  boastful and territorial on social media. So it goes on. It says, so a guy posted last
[07:06.690 --> 07:11.090]  week asking what was going on with his plants in a pic. I was thinking heat stress, but
[07:11.090 --> 07:15.090]  couldn't tell for sure. But me and most of the growers are having the same issue right
[07:15.090 --> 07:19.170]  now. Well, yeah, cause it's hot outside. Uh, these people ripped them apart because he's
[07:19.170 --> 07:23.010]  about posting such a shitty plant and all sorts of shit. Isn't it sad. But then you
[07:23.010 --> 07:27.610]  go look at those people talking shit. You look at their plants, they're even worse.
[07:27.610 --> 07:30.610]  They're even sadder. They don't realize they've got fucking spider mites everywhere. They're
[07:30.610 --> 07:33.650]  like, my plants look amazing. And you look and like, you've got spider mites. You got
[07:33.650 --> 07:37.090]  more fucking spider mites than weed in there. Uh, those are the people that are talking
[07:37.090 --> 07:40.850]  shit. Usually it says, but me and most of the growers are where am I now? I lost my
[07:40.850 --> 07:45.250]  spot. So I responded to the guy. I said, what you need to do is join cannabis or listen
[07:45.250 --> 07:49.610]  and join the grow from your heart podcast or the DGC. That is awesome, man. Thank you
[07:49.610 --> 07:53.450]  for reaching out to somebody on social media and letting them know about the podcast and
[07:53.450 --> 07:57.290]  about resources that are available to them. A lot of people don't even know that we exist.
[07:57.290 --> 08:01.250]  I don't do a lot of podcast advertising. You guys are my advertisers. The word of
[08:01.250 --> 08:06.290]  mouth that you provide, uh, the algorithms on iTunes or Apple podcasts and stitcher and
[08:06.290 --> 08:10.270]  Spotify and of course, YouTube. Uh, those are where I'm advertised and big shout out
[08:10.270 --> 08:14.730]  to the dude grows crew. Those guys give me a lot of advertising. So thank you, Scotty
[08:14.730 --> 08:18.970]  real, the dude guru, everybody behind the scenes. They give me a lot of support. Uh,
[08:18.970 --> 08:22.290]  that's where I get a lot of advertising. A lot of follows come from the dude grow show.
[08:22.290 --> 08:25.290]  So I'm going to reciprocate now, if you're following my show and you have not listened
[08:25.290 --> 08:30.050]  to the dude grows show, the dude grows podcast, wherever you were listening to me, that show
[08:30.050 --> 08:35.130]  was available. I encourage you to go listen to the dude grow show. A very, uh, friendly
[08:35.130 --> 08:39.050]  show, same spirit, same idea, same goal. We want you to grow better cannabis and have
[08:39.050 --> 08:43.930]  a good time doing it. Uh, and I don't feel any rivalry, any, uh, competition. There's
[08:43.930 --> 08:48.210]  nothing like that. Those are my bros. We hang out, we smoke together. Uh, we do a different
[08:48.210 --> 08:51.770]  show. It's a different style. It's a different format. There's multiple dudes there. There's
[08:51.770 --> 08:54.610]  just usually the one of me. We've had Mike on the show a couple of times, which we may
[08:54.650 --> 08:59.650]  want to address here while we're talking. But, um, yeah, mainly it's just me here. So
[08:59.650 --> 09:02.650]  it's a totally different vibe. I've got a different approach to growing. Sometimes they've
[09:02.650 --> 09:06.410]  got a different approach to growing sometimes, but all that information will add up and then
[09:06.410 --> 09:09.930]  you can use what works best for you. I'm gonna get back on track. Like I said, fucking rambly
[09:09.930 --> 09:14.450]  from the dabs anyway. Uh, make sure you follow the dude grows crew. The dude grows show great
[09:14.450 --> 09:19.610]  people. Uh, the DGC, when I say DGC, that means dude grows crew. That is the group of
[09:19.610 --> 09:23.690]  people that follows the dude grows show. I call the I read genetics followers, the
[09:23.690 --> 09:28.010]  ivory army. I don't know if the podcast folks are the ivory army as well. You can be I re
[09:28.010 --> 09:32.650]  army if you want. We've never given them an official name, but let's keep on moving because
[09:32.650 --> 09:37.730]  dabs and rambles anyway, because this community and Facebook blows. Yes. The community on
[09:37.730 --> 09:43.290]  Facebook can blow. I try not to let it get to me, but sometimes, uh, you do the thing.
[09:43.290 --> 09:45.730]  It looks like you just got in a fight with your girlfriend or you just got a shitty text
[09:45.730 --> 09:48.290]  from work or something where you just close the app and throw your phone down. You're
[09:48.290 --> 09:52.490]  like, ah, like Facebook makes me do that. That's the only app that I get that feeling
[09:52.490 --> 09:56.330]  from when I just go, oh, and I seriously face palm, like fucking, and everyone's like, what's
[09:56.330 --> 09:59.770]  wrong? Like, it's just Facebook. So I stay off of there a little bit because I don't
[09:59.770 --> 10:03.910]  need to poison myself with that. I try to put up a big filter when I'm doing it. Let's
[10:03.910 --> 10:09.650]  keep going. It says, um, I'm not perfect, but fuck people like that. Uh, I kind of agree
[10:09.650 --> 10:12.530]  with you. I try not to say fuck certain people, but yeah, fuck people that are like that on
[10:12.530 --> 10:16.490]  social media. Uh, actually no hug a hater, give people like that a big hug, just send
[10:16.490 --> 10:19.770]  them smiley emojis and be cool with them. Uh, they're not going to change no matter
[10:19.770 --> 10:24.290]  what we do. So we can hate them. We can love them. Uh, every village has its idiot. Every
[10:24.290 --> 10:28.210]  village has its asshole. Somebody has got to be that guy. So as long as it's not you,
[10:28.210 --> 10:32.530]  that's cool. Um, it says I could never even, I could never even break someone's balls without
[10:32.530 --> 10:37.010]  at least knowing them, right? People are so comfortable breaking your balls on the internet.
[10:37.010 --> 10:41.090]  Um, after that episode that Mike and I put out, uh, we got our balls broken over the
[10:41.090 --> 10:46.930]  internet. Luckily, I'm having 500 episodes under my belt, a nice following on Instagram.
[10:46.930 --> 10:50.490]  I do Instagram lives. I've been at this for a minute. I was on Periscope before Periscope
[10:50.490 --> 10:54.010]  was popular. I've been doing this for a while. I can handle some trolling. I'm not asking
[10:54.010 --> 11:00.930]  for it. I'm not saying troll me, but, uh, the, uh, the messages and the, uh, the non-encouraging
[11:00.930 --> 11:05.290]  words. That's what I'm going to say that we got on YouTube and emails from the last show.
[11:05.290 --> 11:09.570]  Uh, yeah, people they're, they're keyboard warriors when there's no face-to-face contact,
[11:09.570 --> 11:12.530]  they'll say whatever the fuck they think they can say. Uh, but they, they don't say
[11:12.530 --> 11:15.450]  that shit when you're in the same room with them. It's way different. It says there's
[11:15.450 --> 11:19.330]  a lot of that out there now, and no one wants to be the one who doesn't know. And if there's
[11:19.330 --> 11:23.890]  50 replies, chances are it got covered. Yes, that is the truth. Most of the time, the useful
[11:23.890 --> 11:28.850]  information gets buried by all of the bullshit. I will post a link to the podcast and three
[11:28.850 --> 11:32.650]  or four sentences about what we can do for your grow. And it'll just get, you got to
[11:32.650 --> 11:36.610]  filter through it, even find it. It's feed it vinegar, spray it with fire, dip it in
[11:36.610 --> 11:40.290]  bleach. And then there's my useful answer and it just gets overlooked. And then people
[11:40.290 --> 11:43.970]  laugh at me for giving useful advice. So like your hippie magic won't work. And I'm like,
[11:43.970 --> 11:47.650]  but the fuck, but commercial fucking grower, bro, I do commercial consultations and you
[11:47.650 --> 11:51.890]  should pay me for the fucking sentence I just posted, but they don't even enjoy it. Um,
[11:51.890 --> 11:55.310]  we're going to keep going. It says, but you would be surprised. So people just argue with
[11:55.310 --> 11:59.530]  whatever the other guy said. Then someone says, then it's time to battle on the guy
[11:59.530 --> 12:05.170]  posting is stuck there with no answer and confused. And he is racist. Yeah, that's,
[12:05.170 --> 12:09.090]  that's fucking funny. Yeah. It turns into, uh, the F Trump and I shouldn't even have
[12:09.090 --> 12:13.490]  said that sentence. I may bleep that out. Actually, it turns into the anti-Trump and
[12:13.490 --> 12:18.170]  then it also turns into that guy being racist and then it just continues. Uh, yeah, that
[12:18.170 --> 12:22.930]  is social media, bro. Um, usually I make a bunch of notes on my paper. When I print out
[12:22.930 --> 12:26.570]  your email, I write a couple of notes. So I don't, I don't just blindly go into it.
[12:26.570 --> 12:32.570]  I've got something to say after it. All I wrote on your message was, yup. I agree. That's,
[12:32.570 --> 12:35.250]  that's what I got for you, dude. That is social media. That is Facebook. That is a
[12:35.250 --> 12:39.250]  large part. I've said this, why I started this podcast, because it's hard to filter
[12:39.250 --> 12:43.250]  through the bullshit on the internet. You don't have to have any qualifications, any
[12:43.250 --> 12:47.210]  documentation, no licensing, no regulations. You could post whatever you want on the internet
[12:47.210 --> 12:51.890]  and some people will believe it. Um, so that's where we are with society today. That's not
[12:51.890 --> 12:54.970]  just cannabis. That is the whole damn world. All right, my buddy, Papa wheelie. I want
[12:54.970 --> 12:58.050]  to thank you for the great message. I'm sorry. You're having a tough time on social media.
[12:58.050 --> 13:01.930]  Don't let it get to you. Uh, remember that that is the place where, I don't know, it's
[13:02.290 --> 13:04.570]  the real world, which is where all the nonsense happens. The real stuff is happening here.
[13:04.570 --> 13:07.530]  The real people that care. We're not doing that to each other. When we're talking, hang
[13:07.530 --> 13:10.930]  out with some real folks. Uh, you sound like a great person, a great guy. You get a good
[13:10.930 --> 13:14.450]  head on your shoulders. Don't let social media get to you. I know you're trying to referee
[13:14.450 --> 13:18.090]  in there, but it's like trying to herd kittens refereeing on Facebook. You just got to let
[13:18.090 --> 13:22.530]  it happen. Just do your thing. Enjoy your grow. Uh, if people want to listen to you,
[13:22.530 --> 13:25.810]  maybe start your own group. That may be the way to do it, but people you'll get a following
[13:25.810 --> 13:28.570]  of people that realize, you know what you're talking about and they'll listen to you. They'll
[13:28.570 --> 13:33.810]  ask you questions and that little bit will make the, the fucking face punch feeling that
[13:33.810 --> 13:37.370]  you get from Facebook. It'll make all of that go away. It'll balance it out and make it
[13:37.370 --> 13:40.530]  feel good. You'll get a little bit of reward to go with the face punch is what I think
[13:40.530 --> 13:43.670]  I'm trying to say. All right, Papa Willie, thank you for the great message. I'm going
[13:43.670 --> 13:48.170]  to keep going because this is going to be a long show if I don't focus. Uh, this one
[13:48.170 --> 13:53.010]  comes from used to be cool. What's up brother? Uh, got a bunch of great messages from a bunch
[13:53.010 --> 13:58.050]  of familiar friends in this one. I like this. This one goes, Hey, Rosted Jeff. Um, let's
[13:58.050 --> 14:00.990]  see. Well, there's some parts we can skip here. Don't use my name. Uh, we just call
[14:00.990 --> 14:05.170]  you used to be cool. We got a cool alias for you. It says, I'm sorry we weren't able to
[14:05.170 --> 14:10.810]  meet during your recent trip to Colorado. However, what a breath of fresh air, a fresh
[14:10.810 --> 14:15.650]  breath, breath of fresh air to be in the mountains where everyone wore masks in public. Uh, yeah,
[14:15.650 --> 14:18.970]  you were up there getting fresh air, no mask, no, uh, social distancing because there were
[14:18.970 --> 14:22.610]  no other people up there. I hope you had a good time. I'm sorry I missed you. Uh, you
[14:22.610 --> 14:26.010]  understand what was going on. You actually, uh, commented on it. We don't need to bring
[14:26.010 --> 14:29.250]  people into that. It actually says here, Scotty real said on the show that I had a
[14:29.250 --> 14:33.450]  tooth pulled. Yes, I had a little bit of dental work done and I was unable to hang out. That
[14:33.450 --> 14:37.710]  tooth came out the same day you were in town. I was in no mood for company. I apologize
[14:37.710 --> 14:42.790]  that dentist kicked my ass, but here we are now hanging out on the show. Uh, dentist didn't
[14:42.790 --> 14:47.410]  kick my ass that did was, he did a good job, but God damn, that sucked. Um, go to the dentist.
[14:47.410 --> 14:50.490]  Don't be afraid. It goes on. It says, I have three questions for you and I'll try to be
[14:50.490 --> 14:54.950]  brief three questions, bro. Three. All right, I'll do them all just to spoil you. And thank
[14:54.950 --> 14:59.110]  you for the great message. It said I had a plant Herm and my flower tent with other
[14:59.110 --> 15:04.550]  plants. I was during week six. That is the worst fucking time for Herms. Uh, it says
[15:04.550 --> 15:09.670]  it was not one of yours. That's a good thing. It says of which I have two GGs and one L
[15:09.670 --> 15:13.510]  O G. A funny thing when I read that the first time I had to rack my brain, I was like, what
[15:13.510 --> 15:17.550]  the fuck is LLG? And I just gave up and moved on. It just hit me. It's liberation. Oh, gee,
[15:17.550 --> 15:21.030]  had to stop thinking about it. And the information just fell right out of the sky to me. Uh,
[15:21.030 --> 15:25.790]  GG of course is probably the golden goat. I goes on. It says I have inspected my other
[15:25.790 --> 15:30.550]  plants and I don't think it was seeded and it's almost harvest time. So maybe I skated
[15:30.550 --> 15:35.550]  by this time. However, I wondered how long does Paul and stay viable when it has been
[15:35.550 --> 15:40.830]  released with my other plants? That is a really good question. That is going to be environmentally
[15:40.830 --> 15:45.470]  dependent. It'll probably sit around in the open for like a month, maybe longer, maybe
[15:45.470 --> 15:50.830]  six, maybe eight weeks, depending on the environment. Keep that in mind. The heat will destroy and
[15:51.630 --> 15:55.870]  break down your pollen. Cold will preserve your pollen, humidity and moisture destroy
[15:55.870 --> 16:01.230]  pollen. So if you've had it 50, 60% humidity in that room, that pollen is getting deactivated
[16:01.230 --> 16:05.750]  a little bit more every day. If you got it up to 70 or 80% in there, the pollen is starting
[16:05.750 --> 16:09.990]  to cake together. It's turning weird colors. It's not going to be any good anymore after
[16:09.990 --> 16:14.830]  that. Um, but if you don't touch it, I'm going to say it's probably good. If you just, uh,
[16:14.830 --> 16:18.190]  if you just dumped pollen right here on the desk and left it there and left it, this room
[16:18.190 --> 16:22.470]  stays pretty cool. It's not too hot. Cause I got, uh, sneakers and seeds in here as I
[16:22.470 --> 16:26.510]  try to keep it cool. Uh, they both like the cool aisle. Kind of like it. Cool. I guess.
[16:26.510 --> 16:29.790]  Uh, I think that Paul and would stay on the desk for quite a while. And I could tell when
[16:29.790 --> 16:33.510]  it starts changing colors and getting bad on me and that'll take a little bit. I can
[16:33.510 --> 16:37.550]  keep Paul in, in the fridge for a long, long time. I'll put it in the crisper drawer in
[16:37.550 --> 16:41.190]  the fridge. I've seen it put in the freezer. Uh, when stored properly, Paul and will stay
[16:41.190 --> 16:44.990]  for a long, long time out in the open. I'm going to say, depending on your environment,
[16:44.990 --> 16:49.750]  two to six, maybe eight weeks max. And I'm not saying like completely active, lots of
[16:49.750 --> 16:53.310]  bunches of pollen, but you could have, it's like, you can have just a little fucking pollen
[16:53.310 --> 16:57.070]  is tiny, dude. You know, tiny, tiny pollen is you'd have just one little grain of pollen
[16:57.070 --> 17:00.950]  somewhere that could still be active after a few weeks. Uh, that is my opinion. I have
[17:00.950 --> 17:05.470]  no science to back that up. That is debatable. It is debated, but I think it sticks around
[17:05.470 --> 17:09.230]  for quite a while. If we don't fuck it up, if you have humidity, if you've got wind and
[17:09.230 --> 17:14.630]  moisture and, uh, a lot of varying temperatures, extreme heat, uh, that could destroy it more
[17:14.630 --> 17:18.270]  quickly. The extreme cold will preserve it. Like I said, cold keeps stuff around, heat
[17:18.270 --> 17:22.890]  cooks things and deteriorates it, breaks it down. So a couple of weeks to a lot of weeks
[17:22.890 --> 17:27.510]  is my, uh, unofficial official answer. It goes on. It says my second question, I'm going
[17:27.510 --> 17:30.150]  to bill you for the second one. The first one was free. The second one I'm going to
[17:30.150 --> 17:34.570]  bill you for it says I have never used humidity packs, but recently it seems as though they
[17:34.570 --> 17:41.130]  are stealing flavor from buds and long-term storage. What is your opinion on using them?
[17:41.130 --> 17:45.530]  You know, for a long time, I thought that the humid packs were messing up the flavor.
[17:45.530 --> 17:49.150]  When I worked at a commercial grow where we were sealing stuff up, it was how they did
[17:49.150 --> 17:53.370]  it when I came in and I thought, sure, it seems to be working, but I noticed everything
[17:53.370 --> 17:58.570]  had like a, uh, like a watery flavor, like just straight when you're smoking it, it tasted
[17:58.570 --> 18:02.250]  like there was water in the buds. It had, I've got a very sensitive palate. I could
[18:02.250 --> 18:05.810]  taste a lot of things. I'm sure you could tell by my flavor descriptions on the, when
[18:05.810 --> 18:08.950]  I smoke concentrates, when I smoke flowers, I could tell you if you use too much worm
[18:08.950 --> 18:14.770]  castings and shit like that, but I could taste, I could taste like a wet, watery sort of a
[18:14.770 --> 18:19.170]  flavor in the buds. And when I wasn't smoking stuff that came out of the humidity pack jars,
[18:19.170 --> 18:23.730]  I didn't taste that. Also that stuff tasted stale. It tasted bland. It all tasted the
[18:23.730 --> 18:30.090]  same like that watery flavor. So in my opinion, long-term extreme long-term storage, yes,
[18:30.090 --> 18:35.370]  it did start stealing the turps and the flavors. Once Mike and I took over that facility and
[18:35.370 --> 18:39.450]  the harvesting and drying and curing was done in a much more controlled manner by Mike and
[18:39.450 --> 18:44.770]  I, we eliminated the humid impacts. Eventually we did our serve. We did our method with the
[18:44.770 --> 18:49.410]  humid impacts and it tasted better than we got rid of them and it tasted even better.
[18:49.410 --> 18:55.250]  So what I concluded in my mind, in my theory, in my study, my unofficial study was that
[18:55.250 --> 18:59.810]  the humid impacts work well for like a shorter term storage. If the product is dried and
[18:59.810 --> 19:04.170]  cured properly, you've got to dry it and cure it properly to give it that effect. Then
[19:04.170 --> 19:09.010]  that works for like a medium storage, not a super long storage. And our versions of
[19:09.010 --> 19:12.850]  long lasting weed are probably vastly different, but you can't keep it around for super long
[19:12.850 --> 19:17.210]  in there. That's when I start thinking it steals the turps. When it's not like beyond
[19:17.210 --> 19:19.610]  that, like we should have smoked that like a week ago. And you know, when it gets to
[19:19.610 --> 19:24.170]  that point, that's when I feel like they start ripping off the turps. If it's dried and cured
[19:24.170 --> 19:29.130]  properly and it's just being moved from the facility to the store and then it goes on
[19:29.130 --> 19:32.490]  the shelf and sells in a few days, I don't feel like we lose any turps. It's when it
[19:32.490 --> 19:38.370]  sits around in that container for a long time. That's when I feel like your turps get stolen.
[19:38.370 --> 19:44.130]  So I do agree. I've actually seen friends do experiments and comparisons when they put
[19:44.130 --> 19:48.770]  a fresh bud in a jar without a humid impact and a fresh bud in a jar with a humid impact.
[19:48.770 --> 19:52.450]  The one with the humid impact, I'm not going to say the brand name, it did burn, smoke
[19:52.450 --> 19:58.010]  and grind better. But that was like a week or two weeks that they put it in there. I
[19:58.010 --> 20:01.690]  think once you get to that four and six, six week time period, that's when your turps
[20:01.690 --> 20:04.690]  start kind of getting ripped off. I'm going to take a quick drink and then we will answer
[20:04.690 --> 20:08.730]  question number three. All right, we've come to your last question. And the last question
[20:08.730 --> 20:14.050]  goes, I've got a concern with red and purple stems. All three of my OG plants have developed
[20:14.050 --> 20:19.810]  red stems, despite having ample magnesium in my super soil recipe. How do I know when
[20:19.810 --> 20:27.210]  red stems and petioles are genetic and when they are from a deficiency? Knowing OG Kush
[20:27.410 --> 20:31.890]  plants, quite often your OG Kush crosses and OG Kush things will have purple leaves and
[20:31.890 --> 20:37.050]  purple petioles. So that could very well be just a genetic thing. Don't panic too much.
[20:37.050 --> 20:42.450]  But I do have some good advice for you. There are a few things that cause red and purple
[20:42.450 --> 20:46.570]  petioles and you've got to make sure you've got red or purple. It sounds like you've got
[20:46.570 --> 20:49.830]  red and purple. You could have a combo, it could be right in the middle, but hopefully
[20:49.830 --> 20:55.610]  my advice leads you to one direction. It could be nutrients. If you have got red and purple
[20:55.650 --> 21:01.210]  stems and crunchy leaves, that is probably, let's see, where were we now? That's probably
[21:01.210 --> 21:06.330]  a phosphorus problem. You've probably got a phosphorus deficiency. Red and purple stems
[21:06.330 --> 21:11.010]  and crunchy leaves is a phosphorus deficiency. If it's just purple and the leaves aren't
[21:11.010 --> 21:18.610]  super crunchy, that is probably your magnesium deficiency. Also your pH could be too low.
[21:18.610 --> 21:23.050]  That could be causing a nutrient deficiency, a nutrient lockout. Too low of a pH could
[21:23.050 --> 21:29.930]  make the nutrients not absorb. The cold could be causing your petioles to turn pinkish purple
[21:29.930 --> 21:35.090]  red. If the tops of the petiole is changing colors, but the underside isn't, that is probably
[21:35.090 --> 21:38.530]  from cold. If the whole thing all the way through is changing colors, that's going to
[21:38.530 --> 21:43.570]  be from nutrients. Are the leaves changing colors as well? If the leaves are changing
[21:43.570 --> 21:48.530]  colors as well, that is probably from low pH and also from the cold. If they're crunchy
[21:48.530 --> 21:53.090]  again, that's going to be from phosphorus. Genetics do that. I mentioned a minute ago
[21:53.090 --> 21:58.170]  that the OG Kush varietals will do that. Stuff from the Afghanistan region will get the purple
[21:58.170 --> 22:03.250]  petioles. You see a lot of the, what did I used to grow a long time? The Tora Bora used
[22:03.250 --> 22:06.690]  to get just straight up purple petioles. A lot of the Grateful Dog crosses will give
[22:06.690 --> 22:10.690]  you purple petioles too. I said it multiple ways because I've heard it multiple ways and
[22:10.690 --> 22:16.810]  now you're still listening. Also, something that may not have come to your mind while
[22:16.810 --> 22:19.970]  you were working in the garden, if you have done any bending, popping and twisting or
[22:19.970 --> 22:24.570]  manipulation of that plant, some of the new areas that are being exposed to light may
[22:24.570 --> 22:29.650]  turn purple. That may be a reaction to being exposed to light. Parts that were going straight
[22:29.650 --> 22:33.430]  up, maybe you snapped it and twisted it and bent it down a little bit. That new part that's
[22:33.430 --> 22:38.370]  getting light, that may turn purple on you as a reaction, a response to new light and
[22:38.370 --> 22:43.450]  also a little bit of stress. The combo will add some purple onto there. You've got a couple
[22:43.450 --> 22:49.610]  of options. Red and purple stems with crunchy leaves again is probably a phosphorus deficiency.
[22:49.610 --> 22:54.890]  Just purple petioles is probably a magnesium problem. The pH could be too low. Now here's
[22:54.890 --> 23:00.330]  something to think about. Too much potassium will block out your magnesium. If you've got
[23:00.330 --> 23:06.370]  too much potassium in your feed mix, your plants will not absorb the magnesium. Also,
[23:06.370 --> 23:12.090]  the opposite is true. If you have got too much cow mag, you can give yourself a potassium
[23:12.410 --> 23:18.250]  deficiency. Make sure that your nutrient mix is where you need it to be. See if you've
[23:18.250 --> 23:21.170]  got crunchy leaves, that's going to tell you it's phosphorus. If it's just straight up
[23:21.170 --> 23:26.610]  purple, that is a magnesium problem. It could be the pH. Check the pH of your solution.
[23:26.610 --> 23:32.010]  I've done a couple of episodes now on pH meters and checking pH and dialing in your gear.
[23:32.010 --> 23:35.130]  Maybe check and make sure the pH is accurate and that you're getting the pH of the solution
[23:35.130 --> 23:40.370]  you think. Maybe the temperature could be a little bit warmer in that room. I can only
[23:40.370 --> 23:44.010]  tell you what I suspect and what could be options. Now you've got to go in there and
[23:44.010 --> 23:48.370]  do a little investigating and see what of my options work best for you and see what
[23:48.370 --> 23:52.490]  you need to correct. If it is a phosphorus or a magnesium issue, that is going to be
[23:52.490 --> 23:57.430]  very easy to correct. Hopefully, oh, you said you were in super soil. You probably make
[23:57.430 --> 24:01.050]  a top dress, make a tee. You might be able to pull that out. I'm not a super soil or
[24:01.050 --> 24:05.730]  an organics expert, so I'm going to keep my mouth shut and not say anything wrong in that
[24:05.730 --> 24:09.250]  path. All right, used to be cool. I want to thank you for the great message. He wraps
[24:09.250 --> 24:14.070]  it up with, thanks for any help you can give me and give your mom a hug for me. I promise
[24:14.070 --> 24:19.210]  I'll take a fat dab and I'll give my mom a hug for you. It goes on to say, PS, I recently
[24:19.210 --> 24:25.290]  turned 66, man, how quickly it goes by. Happy fucking birthday, bro. I hope you had a marvelous
[24:25.290 --> 24:31.670]  birthday. I cannot wait to wish you a happy 67th, 68th, and bro 69th birthday as well,
[24:31.670 --> 24:35.610]  and on and on and on. Can't wait to wish you many more happy years. Happy birthday, brother.
[24:35.610 --> 24:40.450]  I hope to hear from you again soon. I hope we can figure out the issues with your plants.
[24:40.450 --> 24:44.330]  Big shout out to used to be cool. All right, I've got another message here in front of
[24:44.330 --> 24:50.490]  me. Let's move right into this one. This one says, good evening, Rastad Jeff. Do you want
[24:50.490 --> 24:53.570]  your name said? I don't know if you want your name said, but good evening, my friend. Thank
[24:53.570 --> 24:59.110]  you for reaching out. It goes on and it says, I hope this email is finding you happy, healthy,
[24:59.110 --> 25:03.130]  and feeling good. I am all of the above, so thank you. It says I'm reaching out today
[25:03.130 --> 25:08.410]  from newly decriminalized Virginia to ask some questions as well as thank you for the
[25:08.410 --> 25:12.810]  wealth of information you provide and for all of the work you have put into our industry.
[25:12.810 --> 25:17.590]  That is a wonderful, wonderful sentence. I've got answers for your questions. Thank you
[25:17.590 --> 25:22.050]  for thanking me, and thanks for noticing that I put a lot of work into the community and
[25:22.050 --> 25:28.130]  the industry. It goes on to say, your genetics, your community outreach, and your willingness
[25:28.130 --> 25:35.890]  to share information are all very inspirational, and they've directly benefited me greatly.
[25:35.890 --> 25:40.770]  So much respect, brother. That is awesome. Once again, thank you for noticing, and you're
[25:40.770 --> 25:45.330]  welcome. You are very welcome. Keep doing what you're doing. Keep watching the show.
[25:45.330 --> 25:48.330]  That's all I ask. Tell more people about the show too. You could do that. It goes on to
[25:48.330 --> 25:54.250]  say, my questions mainly surrounded the usage of CO2 in commercial cannabis grows. I work
[25:54.250 --> 25:59.290]  for a chemical detection company, and I'm looking into opportunities for synergy in
[25:59.290 --> 26:05.850]  your industry that I have a personal interest in. Yeah, that's a really viable ancillary
[26:05.850 --> 26:10.170]  product that we need in the grows. It's not directly cannabis. You don't have to have
[26:10.170 --> 26:15.370]  all of the cannabis licensing. It's going to be much easier for you. It's a great opportunity.
[26:15.370 --> 26:20.490]  Let's talk about it. It says, how widespread is CO2 supplementation in commercial grows?
[26:20.490 --> 26:26.170]  Very. It is very, very viable and very widespread. It is in almost every commercial grow. If it's
[26:26.170 --> 26:30.410]  not in the commercial grow when I get there, I request it. That's one of the things we install
[26:30.410 --> 26:36.650]  almost immediately. Then it says, what PPM range is generally targeted for optimal growth?
[26:38.330 --> 26:42.570]  The problem with that is that CO2 can become a little bit expensive. I would prefer a little
[26:42.570 --> 26:48.570]  bit higher than what we normally run. Most of the time, we go between 900 and 1100 PPMs of CO2 in
[26:48.570 --> 26:54.410]  the rooms. I would like to go closer to 12, maybe 14. That may sound a little bit ridiculous,
[26:54.410 --> 27:02.330]  but you'll see explosive fucking growth at that rate. Getting a big 100 foot by 100 foot by 12
[27:02.330 --> 27:09.690]  or 18 foot tall grow facility to maximize that with 1400 PPMs of CO2 for 12 hours a day is a
[27:09.690 --> 27:17.370]  struggle and it's very expensive. We aim for the 900 to 1100 PPMs of CO2 consistently from the
[27:17.370 --> 27:21.290]  time the lights come on to the lights come off. We want that amount of CO2 in there. There are
[27:21.290 --> 27:26.570]  things creating CO2 all day. We'll talk about that in a minute. Then it says, are CO2 levels
[27:26.570 --> 27:33.210]  monitored at various sites throughout a commercial grow facility? Yes, they are. OSHA requires that
[27:33.210 --> 27:39.050]  we monitor the CO2 very carefully. It's got to be installed professionally. It's got to be
[27:39.050 --> 27:46.890]  monitored. There are bright yellow flashing lights that go off and say dangerous hazardous CO2 levels
[27:46.890 --> 27:51.690]  and the alarm goes off and it will scare the shit out of you. It is completely loud. We've got a lot
[27:51.690 --> 27:58.170]  of meters, a lot of monitors and alarms to go with it. Then it says, is exposure to high levels of
[27:58.170 --> 28:03.290]  CO2 a concern for workers? No, because of all of the monitors and meters and OSHA regulations that
[28:03.290 --> 28:08.570]  I talked about before, if it does get too high, too dangerously high, that alarm will go off and
[28:08.570 --> 28:13.690]  everybody in the building will hear it. It is as loud as the fire alarm and it's fucking scary.
[28:13.770 --> 28:18.730]  It's got a really obnoxious sound to it. It says, I'd appreciate your input and I look forward to
[28:18.730 --> 28:24.090]  the changing legislation in my state and hopefully seeing legal iRee genetics growing in Virginia
[28:24.090 --> 28:28.570]  soil very soon. Me too. I'd love to see some photos of some stuff growing down there.
[28:28.570 --> 28:33.770]  It goes on to say, for the first time, let's see. Oh yeah, it says, could you redact my name and my
[28:33.770 --> 28:37.770]  company? Absolutely. Your name and company will not be said. I'll keep the email paper down here
[28:37.770 --> 28:43.530]  so that nobody sees any of that. Great question about CO2. I did say we would talk a little bit
[28:43.530 --> 28:49.210]  about how CO2 is used in a facility. In the state of Colorado, to the best of my knowledge, at the
[28:49.210 --> 28:56.330]  last time I checked, CO2 burners are illegal in a Colorado commercial cultivation facility. You
[28:56.330 --> 29:01.610]  cannot hang up the CO2 burner, hook it up to the natural gas and run that. That is not allowed.
[29:01.610 --> 29:06.970]  I think they deem that a fire hazard, kind of makes sense. What we do, we've got a service from
[29:06.970 --> 29:11.850]  a company. I can't remember the name. I think it is called Green CO2. I can see the logo in my head.
[29:11.850 --> 29:15.690]  I'm pretty sure it's Green CO2. Shout out to you guys if that's who you are. Sorry if that's not
[29:15.690 --> 29:21.450]  who you are. We actually get big tanks installed outside. They pour a concrete slab outside,
[29:21.450 --> 29:25.610]  the appropriate size, depending on how many tanks we're going to get. They got to pour a pad outside.
[29:25.610 --> 29:30.970]  Then they put six foot tall CO2 canisters. Depending on the size of your rooms and how
[29:30.970 --> 29:35.050]  much CO2 you're going to need, they come and do calculations. They've got the equipment, the math
[29:35.050 --> 29:38.970]  to do that. They've already done that. They know how to do it. They come and do a calculation.
[29:38.970 --> 29:45.130]  They say, you're going to need this much CO2 per room per delivery time. They put tanks outside
[29:45.130 --> 29:50.730]  that they can drive a big truck up that is loaded with CO2 in the truck. They attach a hose to our
[29:50.730 --> 29:55.130]  main tanks and it fills up all of our tanks at one time. They just park for a minute. I watched
[29:55.130 --> 29:58.890]  the guy play on his phone. Fucking, I don't know what he's doing, scrolling, whatever.
[29:58.890 --> 30:03.210]  The little dingy thing goes off and he goes, oh, the shit is full. He gets out and he unplugs the
[30:03.210 --> 30:07.210]  cord and he puts a little thing back in, closes up a gate, puts a lock on it because people steal
[30:07.210 --> 30:11.690]  fucking everything that's outside. He waves and he drives off and my CO2 is refilled for the next
[30:11.690 --> 30:16.170]  duration of time until he comes back, usually about a week. I think he came about every Tuesday.
[30:17.210 --> 30:22.810]  Then he fills up those big tanks. Those big tanks run to a main line inside of the facility.
[30:22.810 --> 30:28.730]  Then each room has a controller and a monitor. On that controller monitor, you type in
[30:28.730 --> 30:34.490]  how much CO2 you want in the room. Then it will release CO2. We run lines around the perimeter
[30:34.490 --> 30:37.770]  of the ceiling of the room. You see where my tapestry is here in the back of the room?
[30:37.770 --> 30:41.770]  There'd just be a line of a plastic line, a perforated plastic line that would go all the
[30:41.770 --> 30:46.090]  way around the room about the door jam height, right around the doorframe there. It just goes
[30:46.090 --> 30:50.250]  all the way around the room. We'd run that perforated line all the way around the rooms.
[30:50.250 --> 30:54.170]  Then when you turn on the CO2, it just pumps through the room and that monitor reads it and
[30:54.170 --> 30:59.130]  it says, oh, you're at the number you set and it turns it off. Then sometimes the machines will
[30:59.130 --> 31:03.210]  freeze. Sometimes shit will go wrong. Sometimes CO2 will keep coming out and then it'll tell you
[31:03.210 --> 31:09.610]  you're at 2000 ppms of CO2. When it hits 2500, I think the alarm goes off and you got to go outside.
[31:10.250 --> 31:15.290]  It's a really high number. It could be like 25, it's 250,000. It only went off a couple of times,
[31:15.290 --> 31:20.090]  but when it went off, we fucking heard it. They deliver the big tanks. The tanks are set up.
[31:20.090 --> 31:25.210]  The tanks run to a controller and a monitor. You tell it how much you want. It's got a light sensor
[31:25.210 --> 31:28.890]  on it. It knows when the lights are on and when the lights are off because we don't want to run
[31:28.890 --> 31:32.170]  CO2 during the lights off. That is a waste of money. It's also not good for the plants.
[31:32.890 --> 31:37.850]  It's got the light sensor. We tell it how much to pump out. It comes on. It's shooting. They told me
[31:37.850 --> 31:42.810]  that the technology shoots a beam out approximately three feet every 30 seconds and measures the
[31:42.810 --> 31:48.330]  amount of CO2 present at that area, three feet from the monitor every 30 seconds and adjusted
[31:48.330 --> 31:53.290]  there. We also hang a few other monitors throughout the facility at strategic places
[31:53.290 --> 31:57.770]  and it monitors there and the fans are supposed to activate and move it around if we have everything
[31:57.770 --> 32:02.330]  dialed in. It's always hard to get all of the parts moving all together at the same time,
[32:02.330 --> 32:05.610]  you guys. Honestly, there's always one or two things that need to be dialed in and a giant
[32:05.610 --> 32:10.090]  commercial grow. We'll get them dialed in, but then once you get that dialed in, something else
[32:10.090 --> 32:14.890]  is going to break too and you get to work on that. It's a lot of fun, but we use a lot of CO2 and
[32:14.890 --> 32:18.570]  that is the short version. I don't know all the technical part. We run the lines, we run the
[32:18.570 --> 32:23.130]  controller and then sometimes the lines freeze, but as long as you got good customer service,
[32:23.130 --> 32:27.130]  the CO2 works wonderfully. It only breaks down a couple of times. Most of the time, it's right
[32:27.130 --> 32:30.650]  after a refill. The fucking lines will freeze and then they don't stop and then all your CO2 is
[32:30.650 --> 32:35.050]  just pumping through the building, but it is a great advantage to commercial growing. You'll see
[32:35.610 --> 32:40.650]  tremendous robust growth. You can run a little bit higher of a temperature in the grow room.
[32:40.730 --> 32:44.890]  In the summer, if you're struggling for a couple of extra degrees, pump up that CO2.
[32:44.890 --> 32:49.930]  That'll cover you. I really think it's helpful. You don't want your name said, but you know who
[32:49.930 --> 32:54.170]  you are. A big thank you for the great message. You are welcome for the great advice. I hope you
[32:54.170 --> 32:59.850]  have a successful adventure in the cannabis industry if you do choose to provide us with CO2.
[33:00.570 --> 33:05.930]  It's a very necessary supplement. If you're going to get into it, please get into it and be
[33:05.930 --> 33:10.170]  reliable. That's what we need in this industry is reliable businesses. All right, ladies and
[33:10.170 --> 33:14.010]  gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers, clone cutters and
[33:14.010 --> 33:19.050]  pollen chuckers, Chad's and Brad's, Brittany's and Courtney's, all you fine cannabis growers
