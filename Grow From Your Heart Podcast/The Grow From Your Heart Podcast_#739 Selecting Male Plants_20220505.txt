[01:59.510 --> 02:05.430]  Grow From Your Heart podcast Discord server. Come hang out. Also there was the
[02:05.430 --> 02:09.430]  wrong link was on my website for a moment. Discord will give you links that
[02:09.430 --> 02:13.230]  do expire. The link on the website accidentally expired. We need to update
[02:13.230 --> 02:16.910]  that. Web Dude if you're watching, remind me to send you a new link. If not I'll do
[02:16.910 --> 02:20.190]  it as I'm editing the show. There will be a new link posted on the website very
[02:20.190 --> 02:24.470]  soon. We will get that corrected. That way we can get everybody right back on track
[02:24.470 --> 02:27.910]  in the Discord community. Alright I feel like I'm rambling. There's one more thing
[02:27.910 --> 02:31.350]  I should talk about before we get to the main topic of today's podcast. I am
[02:31.350 --> 02:35.830]  recording during a crazy thunder and lightning storm. It started right as I
[02:35.830 --> 02:39.070]  decided to record. It was raining a little bit. I hit record and then we got
[02:39.070 --> 02:42.870]  some major thunder and lightning. So if you hear some chaos in the background, it
[02:42.870 --> 02:46.990]  is not World War 3 to the best of my knowledge out there. We did take a couple
[02:46.990 --> 02:50.190]  of dabs. It's been a minute since I looked outside but if you hear some
[02:50.190 --> 02:54.550]  noise it is just a major thunderstorm. Enjoy that thunderous sound. It is
[02:54.550 --> 02:57.830]  powerful. It shook the whole house. It scared the shit out of me. Maybe I'll clip
[02:57.830 --> 03:00.950]  that part out where I almost shit my pants during the thunder. Anyway if you
[03:00.950 --> 03:04.710]  hear some noise that's what's happening. I did mention I took some dabs. That's
[03:04.710 --> 03:09.790]  right. I smoked some live batter of the machine. That's right. A grower in Denver
[03:09.790 --> 03:12.230]  who does not want to be mentioned because you guys will bother him and
[03:12.230 --> 03:16.950]  harass him for too much product. A grower in Denver grew the machine. He was one of
[03:16.950 --> 03:19.750]  the test growers. He got to grow the machine before a lot of people. He found
[03:19.750 --> 03:24.110]  a great phenotype that smells like skunk ass covered in gasoline. It sounds
[03:24.110 --> 03:30.150]  disgusting. I love it. He makes amazing BHO rosin, BHO batter out of it. When I
[03:30.150 --> 03:34.470]  smoke that stuff I get a little silly. I feel like I get these blinders on. I feel
[03:34.470 --> 03:37.190]  like there's like tunnel vision or the things they put on the horses so the
[03:37.190 --> 03:40.310]  horse can't look to the side. It just stays focused on the journey. I feel like
[03:40.310 --> 03:43.590]  that happens to me when I smoke that. So big shout out to my friend. He's
[03:43.590 --> 03:47.270]  listening. He's watching. He does not want to shout out. Good work on the machine
[03:47.270 --> 03:52.190]  bro. You found a great phenotype and it fucking it extracts it processes. It
[03:52.310 --> 03:55.630]  turns into great concentrate. So that's what I'm trying to say. So the main
[03:55.630 --> 03:59.310]  topic there was it's fucking storming outside. The second part of that was I'm
[03:59.310 --> 04:02.550]  high off the machine. Shout out to the machine. All right now I said I was going
[04:02.550 --> 04:06.230]  to talk about male plants in this episode. There's some thunder and lightning. I
[04:06.230 --> 04:09.310]  hope you guys can hear that. We're going to talk about male plants. I am a seed
[04:09.310 --> 04:13.230]  breeder. Many of you may not realize or may not know that not only am I the host
[04:13.230 --> 04:17.070]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, I am also the head breeder, the sole
[04:17.070 --> 04:22.190]  proprietor of IRI Genetics premium seeds. We make a regular, uh, feminized
[04:22.210 --> 04:26.150]  and regular seeds are all photo periods. I do not make any auto flower seeds.
[04:26.510 --> 04:30.510]  There is a collaboration happening with myself and Daz from Night Owl. We are
[04:30.510 --> 04:34.870]  working on a, uh, auto flower project together. Currently I do not offer that.
[04:34.870 --> 04:38.830]  That is coming in the future. Um, I've said before I won't make autos. My buddy
[04:38.830 --> 04:42.110]  Daz stepped up. He's going to make some autos for us. I'm gonna help do some
[04:42.110 --> 04:46.430]  selections. That'll be cool. Uh, but I am IRI Genetics premium seeds. That's 90%
[04:46.430 --> 04:49.950]  me. I run the Instagram. I'm the dude for the company. I have some helpers
[04:49.950 --> 04:53.750]  that do a few things, but most of that is me. So let's talk about seed breeding
[04:53.750 --> 04:58.350]  and selecting male plants. A lot of IRI Genetics is success is based on the male
[04:58.350 --> 05:02.110]  plants, which I have chosen. I've done a lot of work with a golden goat plant. I
[05:02.110 --> 05:05.390]  did not create the golden goat. I was given the golden goat. Uh, the plant is
[05:05.390 --> 05:08.270]  a gift from a friend that I used to call pineapple express. What's up, bro? I
[05:08.270 --> 05:12.350]  hope you hear this. A big shout out to my dude, pineapple express. He gave me
[05:12.350 --> 05:18.510]  the clone of golden goat. Uh, had to be 2007, maybe 2008, maybe 2009 at the
[05:18.510 --> 05:21.670]  latest. The memory is a little hazy. I didn't write it down. Just trying to
[05:21.670 --> 05:25.790]  pull it out of my ass. It was about 2008 2009 when I got that golden goat clone.
[05:26.030 --> 05:30.190]  I did some reversal breeding with the golden goat clone. Everything I so I
[05:30.190 --> 05:33.430]  reversed the golden goat using a solution. It was a female plant, but I
[05:33.430 --> 05:36.550]  used it as a pollen donor, which is technically the same thing I'm doing
[05:36.550 --> 05:40.110]  with the male plant. Everything I did with that reversed golden goat was
[05:40.110 --> 05:44.390]  magic. Everything it pollinated was gold. Uh, then I took the gold, took
[05:44.390 --> 05:47.470]  the, I said, took, then I took the golden goat and I pollinated that with
[05:47.470 --> 05:52.150]  the daybreaker. I made my own cross called arise. I made my own arise s one
[05:52.470 --> 05:56.550]  out of that batch of arise s one seeds. I found a male in there that was
[05:56.630 --> 06:00.390]  stellar. He's everything I could ask for in a male plant that I was looking
[06:00.390 --> 06:04.070]  for at that time. And we're going to talk about that a lot. But that arise
[06:04.070 --> 06:08.590]  male plant got, he's got his own name. He is in a rise F one plant, but he's
[06:08.590 --> 06:12.950]  got his own name. He is known as King Solomon. So King Solomon has pollinated
[06:13.110 --> 06:16.150]  hundreds of other female plants. If you understand culture, you'll understand
[06:16.150 --> 06:20.390]  why I chose the name Solomon for him. Uh, but King Solomon is a lot of what
[06:20.390 --> 06:24.030]  makes my company successful. People know me for my, I know my company for my
[06:24.030 --> 06:28.270]  arise male. People look for things. If I say I pollinated this plant with
[06:28.270 --> 06:32.470]  Solomon, like I want that, I need those seeds. So Solomon is a very sought
[06:32.470 --> 06:37.630]  after male, a very reliable male plant. Um, now let's talk about what makes a,
[06:37.950 --> 06:41.630]  a reliable sought after male plant. Since I'm a breeder, I do a lot of
[06:41.630 --> 06:45.150]  breeding. I'm talking about my success with King Solomon, my successful male.
[06:45.270 --> 06:49.430]  Let's talk about selecting a male plant for your breeding and traits that we
[06:49.430 --> 06:53.750]  would be looking for and traits that would be desirable and how I do a male.
[06:53.750 --> 06:57.510]  Let's just jump right into it. So first of all, it's all about your goal and
[06:57.510 --> 07:02.150]  your desire. What are you trying to do as a breeder, as a seed maker? Are you
[07:02.150 --> 07:06.310]  working with female plants that you want to improve? Do you have an aroma,
[07:06.310 --> 07:09.630]  a flavor and effect that you were specifically looking for? Some people
[07:09.630 --> 07:13.750]  have physical or mental or other types of ailments which they are trying to
[07:13.750 --> 07:19.710]  cure or mitigate or find relief from with cannabis. And sometimes we found
[07:19.710 --> 07:22.350]  that this plant does a lot of good things and this plant does a lot of
[07:22.350 --> 07:24.830]  good things. But this plant is missing something and this one's missing
[07:24.830 --> 07:28.590]  something. Maybe if we breed them together, we can put the aroma and
[07:28.590 --> 07:31.870]  flavor from this one and the potency and this one will get the headache relief
[07:31.870 --> 07:34.910]  from this one and the body relief from this one. It may work perfect for some
[07:34.950 --> 07:39.510]  patients, for a specific person. So maybe you're breeding for a specific
[07:39.870 --> 07:43.310]  person's medicine to treat them. Maybe you're breeding for your grow. Maybe
[07:43.310 --> 07:47.030]  you're breeding just because you got this cool idea that if you cross plant
[07:47.030 --> 07:51.550]  A with plant B, plant C is going to be fucking stellar. It is all about your
[07:51.550 --> 07:55.630]  goal. What are you breeding for? Also, are you breeding for your personal
[07:55.630 --> 07:59.830]  selection, for your personal... Is it a hobby? Is it something, a passion that
[07:59.830 --> 08:03.150]  you're trying to do? Or do you plan on doing this on a commercial level,
[08:03.150 --> 08:08.190]  putting seeds out for retail? It's all about your goal. Most of anything in
[08:08.190 --> 08:11.310]  life, if you want to be successful, here I go getting all philosophical, it's
[08:11.310 --> 08:14.750]  all about your goal. Set yourself up for success from the very beginning.
[08:14.990 --> 08:17.630]  That way, when you get to the end, you're happy with the outcome you got
[08:17.630 --> 08:20.110]  there. You didn't have to make all kinds of side paths and do all kinds of
[08:20.110 --> 08:23.830]  weird work. Set yourself up for success from the beginning. So it's all about
[08:23.830 --> 08:27.390]  a good goal with a male plant. Why are you breeding it? What are you trying to
[08:27.390 --> 08:31.550]  do? What are you intending to achieve with the cross or crosses that you make
[08:31.550 --> 08:35.550]  from this male? It's like if you're trying to make... I'm going to pick
[08:35.550 --> 08:39.150]  random foods here. If we're trying to make lasagna and cake, we need
[08:39.150 --> 08:42.270]  completely different ingredients. If I'm making lasagna and I show up with
[08:42.270 --> 08:46.350]  ingredients for cake, we can't make a successful cake or the opposite. I'm not
[08:46.350 --> 08:48.550]  even sure I went with that. But you get what I'm saying. If I don't have the
[08:48.550 --> 08:52.630]  right shit, the goal will never be the same. The goal will never be reached. So
[08:52.630 --> 08:56.270]  set yourself up for success. If you're trying to make a short, squatty plant
[08:56.270 --> 09:00.110]  that flowers early, a tall, skinny male plant will not be the way to go. You
[09:00.150 --> 09:03.470]  need the male plant that is short and squatty and flowers early. So it's all
[09:03.470 --> 09:07.870]  about that goal. Then it's all about what am I trying to do? What am I trying to
[09:07.870 --> 09:12.230]  fix or create? Or what's my final destination? That's what it's all about
[09:12.230 --> 09:15.550]  in breeding. So if you've got to pick a male plant that will get you to your
[09:15.550 --> 09:20.470]  final destination, what is the desired shape? One of the first things we can see
[09:20.470 --> 09:25.030]  in plants is leaf shape and plant structure. By looking at leaf shape, we
[09:25.030 --> 09:28.550]  can kind of get an idea of a lot more of the plant, how it's going to grow. If
[09:28.550 --> 09:31.830]  the leaves are long and skinny, that plant's probably going to get tall. It's
[09:31.830 --> 09:34.470]  going to get kind of lanky. It's going to take a little bit of time to flower.
[09:34.590 --> 09:37.710]  If the leaves are real wide and you can camp out under them and make shade with
[09:37.710 --> 09:41.310]  them, that plant most likely will stay short and stocky and it will finish a
[09:41.310 --> 09:45.110]  little more quickly. Of course, there are anomalies. The OG cushions make those
[09:45.110 --> 09:47.990]  big leaves and then they take a little while to flower and they get stretchy.
[09:48.110 --> 09:50.710]  There's going to be things in between there, but the leaf shape will give you
[09:50.710 --> 09:55.310]  a hint of what you're looking for. What type of leaf shape are you looking for?
[09:55.310 --> 09:57.950]  You know, if you've grown, if you're breeding, I hope you've grown a lot of
[09:57.950 --> 10:02.310]  plants. If you're breeding, you know what kind of plants you like, you know
[10:02.310 --> 10:05.550]  what leaf shape you're interested in, what the goal is. So what kind of leaf
[10:05.550 --> 10:09.870]  shape are you looking for? Then what kind of plant structure are you looking for?
[10:10.150 --> 10:14.110]  I tend to breed, I'm super tall and skinny and lanky. The plants I breed
[10:14.630 --> 10:18.950]  seem to kind of fall that direction. I make tall, skinny, lanky plants. Some of
[10:18.950 --> 10:21.910]  the stuff I breed will be shorter and squattier, but it just depends on what
[10:21.910 --> 10:25.630]  I'm working with. I like plants that can get kind of bigger because a lot of my
[10:25.630 --> 10:28.590]  stuff ends up in a commercial environment. I like plants that grow
[10:28.590 --> 10:32.230]  really tall and make big giant top colas. That's just something I really enjoy.
[10:32.470 --> 10:36.030]  Some breeders want stuff that stays shorter and squattier because their
[10:36.030 --> 10:39.070]  environment or their customers are growing in shorter, squattier
[10:39.070 --> 10:42.270]  environments. So it's all about the desired goal. What is the shape and
[10:42.270 --> 10:45.950]  structure? What is the height? If your plants are going to get too tall, many
[10:45.950 --> 10:49.670]  people can't grow them. If they're going to get too wide, many people can't grow
[10:49.670 --> 10:54.230]  them. So find a male plant that offers the structure which you desire. The
[10:54.230 --> 10:58.390]  width, the height, all of that stuff matters. But also, veg time. Do they
[10:58.390 --> 11:02.790]  veg quickly? Are they real slow to veg? When you cut clones, do the clones root
[11:02.790 --> 11:05.430]  well? Because you're going to want to keep this male plant around. If you make
[11:05.430 --> 11:08.870]  crosses with it and it's successful, the next thing you want to do is make more
[11:08.870 --> 11:12.390]  crosses. So you've got to be able to clone this male plant. That trait will
[11:12.390 --> 11:17.270]  also pass to the offspring that clone ability. So how do they veg? Do they grow
[11:17.270 --> 11:22.310]  well? Do they handle stress? Do they handle problems? How long is the flower
[11:22.310 --> 11:26.230]  time? A lot of people don't get the opportunity to flower out a male plant.
[11:26.230 --> 11:29.030]  We only get to let it go long enough to see that it's a male and then we cut it
[11:29.030 --> 11:34.390]  down. I've got a space dedicated to male plants. I'll put multiple male plants in
[11:34.390 --> 11:38.310]  a room and flower them all out at one time and see who does the best. Just like
[11:38.310 --> 11:42.310]  we do a pheno hunt for female plants. That's what I would recommend. Grow your
[11:42.310 --> 11:46.390]  plants, isolate the males, take notes, number them, plant one, plant two, and
[11:46.390 --> 11:49.590]  then take notes. Plant number one is doing this. Plant number two is doing
[11:49.590 --> 11:53.190]  this. You can visually see most of the things you want to see as a breeder.
[11:53.190 --> 11:56.230]  Once you've gotten the eye, you can see like, oh, that's the one. You'll start
[11:56.230 --> 11:59.670]  noticing. So start paying attention to flower time. When you put the plant into
[11:59.670 --> 12:03.270]  flower, how does it react? Does it go into flower quickly? Does it take a while
[12:03.270 --> 12:06.470]  to go into flower? Does it skyrocket and stretch the minute you put it into
[12:06.470 --> 12:11.030]  flower? How long is that stretch phase? Some plants stretch for 14 days. Some
[12:11.030 --> 12:14.470]  plants stretch for four weeks. It just depends on what kind of genetics you've
[12:14.470 --> 12:18.550]  got there. Find a male plant that has the acceptable amount and time frame of
[12:18.550 --> 12:21.830]  stretch which you are looking for because that's going to translate heavily
[12:21.830 --> 12:27.670]  into your offspring. Now let's talk about pollen time and pollen production. If
[12:27.670 --> 12:31.030]  you're making seeds, we obviously need pollen. How long does it take for that
[12:31.030 --> 12:34.950]  male plant to start producing viable pollen and enough of it to make it worth
[12:34.950 --> 12:39.030]  pollinating your garden? Some are really stingy. Some, they'll start putting out
[12:39.030 --> 12:42.710]  pollen really soon. You've got to find the one that produces at the time you
[12:42.710 --> 12:47.030]  want and the amount of pollen which you desire. Something I like in a male plant
[12:47.030 --> 12:51.270]  is a big fat top cola that just tells me that it's going to send fat tops to
[12:51.270 --> 12:55.030]  its offspring. If you can get a male plant that produces a lot of fat tops,
[12:55.030 --> 12:58.870]  that's always a good thing. I like those big fat tops. Those male plants give me
[12:58.870 --> 13:03.110]  a lot of pollen. So what does the top cola look like? How is it shaped? How many
[13:03.110 --> 13:07.590]  colas does it have? How does it branch up? Is it all one big top cola or a bunch
[13:07.590 --> 13:10.710]  of colas that reach up to the top? What are you looking for the offspring to do
[13:10.710 --> 13:15.670]  because that is going to translate heavily into the progeny of this plant.
[13:15.670 --> 13:19.910]  Now, how does the male plant handle drought stress, flood stress, nutrient
[13:19.910 --> 13:24.870]  stress? I want to stress these plants out and see what they do under pressure.
[13:24.870 --> 13:28.630]  How do they handle problems? Do they take problems and stress well? Because that
[13:28.630 --> 13:33.190]  is going to translate heavily into the offspring. If you've got the opportunity
[13:33.190 --> 13:38.310]  to put these male plants in an environment in which you know is prone to get
[13:38.310 --> 13:41.990]  powdery mildew, throw those plants in there. See if they get PM. See how they
[13:41.990 --> 13:45.670]  react to it. If they don't, definitely breed with those male plants. You want
[13:45.670 --> 13:49.270]  those males that give you resistance. A lot of that resistance and health and
[13:49.270 --> 13:54.310]  vigor will come from your male plants. So stress them out. Give them cold stress.
[13:54.310 --> 13:58.550]  Give them heat stress. Give them drought stress. Give them over watering stress.
[13:58.550 --> 14:03.190]  Overfeed them. Underfeed them. See what they do. See how they react. If they
[14:03.190 --> 14:06.150]  peter out and just fall apart and die on you, don't fuck with that male plant.
[14:06.150 --> 14:10.150]  That's weak. We don't need that dude in the garden. Our whole entire goal, well,
[14:10.150 --> 14:15.990]  one of our goals, a very important goal, should be to improve upon the cannabis
[14:15.990 --> 14:19.590]  plant. When we're taking plant A and plant B and breeding them, we need it to
[14:19.590 --> 14:23.750]  come out, I would expect and hope it to come out better than plants A and B. We
[14:23.750 --> 14:27.750]  need plant C to be better. If not, then we're just going back in the line of
[14:27.750 --> 14:31.190]  cannabis. If you're not improving on it some way, you're not doing the plant any
[14:31.190 --> 14:34.230]  service. You're not doing yourself justice as a breeder. One of the hardest
[14:34.230 --> 14:37.190]  things is to admit and realize that you just made a bunch of seeds that are
[14:37.190 --> 14:41.510]  mediocre. I'm getting off track. But think about plant stress. Think about
[14:41.510 --> 14:44.870]  stressing these plants out and see how they react before we breed with them.
[14:44.870 --> 14:49.350]  Like I said, if you put that male plant in an area that gets powdery mildew all
[14:49.350 --> 14:52.870]  the time and this male plant doesn't get it, that is a great candidate for
[14:52.870 --> 14:57.110]  pollen chucking. Use that male. Where do we go from there? Color. Does your male
[14:57.110 --> 15:00.870]  plant put out color? A lot of people will find male plants that as they start to
[15:00.870 --> 15:04.630]  fade, here's why we got to grow them out like eight, nine, maybe even 10 weeks of
[15:04.630 --> 15:08.390]  flower on a male plant. See if it starts changing colors. Does it get yellows?
[15:08.390 --> 15:11.590]  Does it get purples? Does it get oranges? Sometimes they'll put out those real
[15:11.590 --> 15:15.430]  pretty red colors. Those plants that put out those colors will pass that trait
[15:15.430 --> 15:20.390]  along to the progeny. So pay attention to that trait. What about trichomes? Is
[15:20.390 --> 15:24.310]  your male plant putting out trichomes? If that bad dog is putting out trichomes,
[15:24.310 --> 15:29.110]  then it will definitely pass on potency as a trait in the future. So check that
[15:29.110 --> 15:34.230]  out. Then does that male plant have any special traits, positive or
[15:34.230 --> 15:38.710]  negative? Because those things will appear in the offspring. If that plant
[15:38.710 --> 15:42.550]  has a problem, if it's pissing you off because of this one reason, don't breed
[15:42.550 --> 15:46.950]  with it because that one reason will be, what's it called, exacerbated. It will
[15:46.950 --> 15:50.950]  be exponentially displayed in the progeny. So don't use that one if it's
[15:50.950 --> 15:55.190]  already pissing you off. If it's doing something that you go, oh, that's rad. I
[15:55.190 --> 15:58.230]  like this plant. That's what you're supposed to do. That's what breeding is
[15:58.230 --> 16:01.430]  about. You're supposed to be drawn to it, attracted to it, and want to reproduce
[16:01.430 --> 16:04.470]  with it. It's weird that we're looking at a plant and getting that feeling, but
[16:04.470 --> 16:07.190]  it is the right idea. You go, oh, that plant right there, bro. I want to
[16:07.190 --> 16:09.990]  pollinate that one with King Solomon. That's going to be awesome. That's the
[16:09.990 --> 16:13.430]  excitement that I feel when I see the right male plant or the right female
[16:13.430 --> 16:16.470]  plant for a breeding project. So pay attention to that. You'll get that
[16:16.470 --> 16:20.070]  feeling inside. Don't breed with the plant just because you can. It's not
[16:20.070 --> 16:23.270]  best practices to breed with a male plant just because you've got it, just
[16:23.270 --> 16:25.830]  because somebody gave me a male plant just because I have some pollen. That
[16:25.830 --> 16:30.310]  doesn't mean you have to breed with it. Breeding should be about selection.
[16:30.390 --> 16:34.470]  Selection should be a very important part of your breeding. I consider it like,
[16:35.190 --> 16:37.990]  sure, you could let somebody else pick out the pollen, but that's just like
[16:37.990 --> 16:41.590]  somebody sending you sperm and you're making babies with it. How the fuck do I
[16:41.590 --> 16:44.630]  know what's going to come out? Who knows? I'd like to do a little bit of
[16:44.630 --> 16:47.430]  selection in that process. It means a lot to me. I'm going to have to deal
[16:47.430 --> 16:50.950]  with the progeny forever, so why don't I do a little bit of selection? So
[16:50.950 --> 16:56.790]  color, trichome, special traits. Another thing I want to touch on is I usually
[16:56.790 --> 17:01.910]  do not use the first male plants to show me that they are male and to go
[17:01.910 --> 17:06.710]  into flower and start producing pollen. Let me explain that a little bit. Let's
[17:06.710 --> 17:10.230]  hypothetically say I run a batch of seeds. We don't need a number. We're
[17:10.230 --> 17:13.670]  going to say a batch. I've got plenty of seeds, right? Half of those are going
[17:13.670 --> 17:16.150]  to be females. They're going to go to another room. Half of them are going to
[17:16.150 --> 17:19.430]  be males. We're putting them in our project right here. Some of those plants
[17:19.430 --> 17:22.950]  are going to start showing that they're male even before we put them into
[17:22.950 --> 17:26.630]  flower. Those are getting cold. I don't want those. Then when they go into
[17:26.630 --> 17:30.310]  flower, it's going to take about 14 days for most of them to show me that
[17:30.310 --> 17:33.910]  they're dudes, but some of them are going to start popping balls early. I
[17:33.910 --> 17:38.070]  don't want to use the male plants that start popping balls and showing sex too
[17:38.070 --> 17:43.270]  early because in my opinion, those plants are going to contribute too much
[17:43.270 --> 17:48.310]  of themselves to my breeding project. What I mean is when I breed that male
[17:48.310 --> 17:52.390]  plant to a female plant, I'm not going to see enough of the female plant in
[17:52.390 --> 17:55.510]  the progeny to make it worth a breeding project. It's going to be just
[17:55.510 --> 18:00.790]  reproducing that male plant more often than not out of the progeny, the
[18:00.790 --> 18:05.270]  offspring of that breeding project. I like to find a male plant. My theory, my
[18:05.270 --> 18:09.590]  opinion is that that plant has just got too much testosterone. He's just too
[18:09.590 --> 18:13.350]  much of a beefcake. He's a gym rat. Anything he breeds do, all the kids are
[18:13.350 --> 18:16.470]  going to look just like him. We all know this guy. He's got fucking six kids.
[18:16.470 --> 18:21.110]  They all look just like him. We want to do it to where the breeding looks a
[18:21.110 --> 18:24.950]  little bit like mommy and a little bit like daddy. I hope for 50-50 in the mix
[18:24.950 --> 18:28.150]  when I do breeding because if not, then I'm just recreating the female or
[18:28.150 --> 18:32.390]  recreating the male. What I'm saying is I don't like to use the male plants
[18:32.390 --> 18:36.150]  that express flower and start showing their flower and showing their sex right
[18:36.150 --> 18:39.430]  away. I said I wasn't going to pick a number. Now I'm going to pick a number.
[18:39.430 --> 18:43.270]  If I've got 10 of them, I probably get rid of the first three right away. The
[18:43.270 --> 18:46.230]  first three to show me flower, not going to use them. Then we're going to work
[18:46.230 --> 18:50.150]  with that four, five, and six. Those guys are probably going to be the ones I
[18:50.150 --> 18:53.910]  use. The later plants to show me flower, I don't want those for the exact
[18:53.910 --> 18:58.150]  opposite reason. They're going to make my offspring take way too long to flower.
[18:58.150 --> 19:01.750]  I want those plants that are right in the middle that show me good traits,
[19:01.750 --> 19:05.430]  that show me good potential. Now, something else people are doing, we are
[19:05.430 --> 19:10.150]  using sex testing through labs. Through the lab, you can actually take a clipping
[19:10.150 --> 19:14.150]  of your leaf. It's just a little tiny, like a hole punch of a leaf. You can send
[19:14.150 --> 19:19.350]  that to a lab. They can test that sample for the presence of cannabinoid
[19:19.350 --> 19:22.710]  precursors. If you're able to send your male plants to a lab and they can tell
[19:22.710 --> 19:25.590]  you that that male plant has a high opportunity, a high potential for
[19:25.590 --> 19:29.670]  cannabinoids, use that bad dog. That is a great way to do some breeding
[19:29.670 --> 19:32.790]  selection. I always, like I said before, like to see the plants, touch the
[19:32.790 --> 19:36.710]  plants, rub them, feel them, smell them, abuse them. That's the way I like to do
[19:36.710 --> 19:41.030]  breeding selection. Don't use those earlier flowering males because that's
[19:41.030 --> 19:44.630]  going to transfer into the offspring. They're going to flower too quickly and
[19:44.630 --> 19:48.310]  they are also going to be too beefcakey, too much of that male. I wouldn't want
[19:48.310 --> 19:53.830]  to do that. Now, at least half of your offspring is going to show the male
[19:53.830 --> 19:57.350]  traits. Keep that in mind when you are selecting. Whatever you're going to add
[19:57.350 --> 20:01.910]  that male to, at least 50% will be, if we do this correctly, hopefully, at least
[20:01.910 --> 20:05.750]  50% of that is going to be displayed in the offspring. Whatever you're adding to
[20:05.750 --> 20:10.150]  that mix is going to show. Make it a good male plant. Make it something
[20:10.150 --> 20:13.430]  worthwhile, something you'd be proud of. Like I said a moment ago, don't just
[20:13.430 --> 20:18.870]  take a male plant because one of your friends has a male. That may work, maybe.
[20:18.870 --> 20:22.470]  It could be cool. You may make some gems, but you may make some complete garbage.
[20:22.470 --> 20:26.230]  It's all about selecting that male. If that male gets your attention, if it's
[20:26.230 --> 20:29.590]  what you want, do it. But if it's growing weird, if it's wonky, if it's got
[20:29.590 --> 20:33.990]  problems, get rid of it because that is going to cause you more problems down
[20:33.990 --> 20:38.390]  the line. Now, let's get into the fun part. The only way to really tell what we
[20:38.390 --> 20:42.230]  have created with these male plants is by growing out the seeds that they were
[20:42.230 --> 20:46.230]  used to make. So the only way to find out if your male plant was really a good
[20:46.230 --> 20:51.430]  selection is to pollinate multiple females with that plant. In my opinion,
[20:51.430 --> 20:55.430]  you need to pollinate multiple females because if you just pollinate one plant
[20:55.430 --> 20:59.830]  and it works, that could be an anomaly. That could be a hit. That could be a
[20:59.830 --> 21:03.590]  fluke. If you pollinate multiple plants and they're all great, all of the
[21:03.590 --> 21:07.910]  offspring come out amazing, you did a really good selection job. If 50% of
[21:07.910 --> 21:11.270]  them are great, you did a pretty good selection job. But the first time you do
[21:11.270 --> 21:14.790]  this, you just want to see what you created and see how your selection process
[21:14.790 --> 21:18.550]  worked. It took a long time. You got male plants, you got multiple female
[21:18.550 --> 21:22.070]  plants, you took your favorite male plant out of the group, you pollinated
[21:22.070 --> 21:25.350]  those girls. Now it's going to take you about eight, maybe nine weeks to get
[21:25.350 --> 21:28.390]  those seeds. Got to get the seeds out, get everything cleaned up. Now we've
[21:28.390 --> 21:32.150]  got to germinate and grow a bunch of seeds, keep them separated, keep them
[21:32.150 --> 21:35.590]  numbered and labeled, document the growth and see what you've created. That is
[21:35.590 --> 21:39.670]  the fun part. That is where we see, did we choose the correct male? What does
[21:39.670 --> 21:43.590]  that male give to the mix? Look at the traits of that male plant. Look at the
[21:43.590 --> 21:47.030]  traits of your female plants which you have pollinated. Now grow out those
[21:47.030 --> 21:51.670]  seeds and try to identify this plant is doing this. This trait is from the mom,
[21:51.670 --> 21:54.870]  this trait is from the male. Now grow out the other one. This trait is from the
[21:54.870 --> 21:58.230]  mom, this trait is from the male. Try to see what that male is delivering across
[21:58.230 --> 22:02.150]  the board to multiple crosses. Then you've got good feedback, good data, good
[22:02.150 --> 22:06.630]  input on what that dude is actually delivering in the mix, what he's adding
[22:06.630 --> 22:10.470]  to the progeny, what he's doing to the breeding, what you're contributing to
[22:10.470 --> 22:14.070]  your breeding project. That is the only way to do it. But that is the funnest
[22:14.070 --> 22:19.030]  part. So breed, make a bunch of seeds, then grow them out. If you...hopefully
[22:19.030 --> 22:22.230]  you kept a clone of that male because if you like what you did, now you know
[22:22.230 --> 22:25.990]  you've got a solid male, you can make a bunch more seeds. When you make more of
[22:25.990 --> 22:29.270]  your favorites out of that first batch, replace the plants you didn't like the
[22:29.270 --> 22:33.030]  outcome of and put new bad bitches in there, pollinate those, test those. That
[22:33.030 --> 22:36.230]  is kind of the way that I got my start with King Solomon. Pollinated some
[22:36.230 --> 22:40.070]  things, grew them. I thought, this is fucking amazing. Sent those out, let
[22:40.070 --> 22:43.030]  friends grow them. While they were growing them, I pollinated more shit to
[22:43.030 --> 22:46.790]  find out if I had a real stud on my hands or if I just hit one out of the
[22:46.790 --> 22:50.230]  park accidentally. It turns out King Solomon is a fucking stud. Everything he
[22:50.230 --> 22:55.750]  pollinates grows with more vigor, it creates more resin, more potency. It just
[22:55.750 --> 22:59.510]  solves all of the problems. I call King Solomon the problem solver, the
[22:59.510 --> 23:04.230]  improver, and the fixer of most things. Where are we now? If you grow out those
[23:04.230 --> 23:07.830]  plants and you find out that that male didn't do what you wanted it to do, guess
[23:07.830 --> 23:11.590]  what? Start over. It's not that big a deal. If you're not relying on it, if this
[23:11.590 --> 23:15.110]  is not your business, and it should not be your business yet, that's something we
[23:15.110 --> 23:18.470]  should touch on. If you haven't been making seeds and testing seeds and doing
[23:18.470 --> 23:22.710]  this, don't jump in this as a business. Your first run of seeds is a hobby. This
[23:22.710 --> 23:26.070]  is an experiment. How do you know that you've even made anything good? Don't
[23:26.070 --> 23:30.150]  put your name on this yet until you grow it. If the first round isn't good,
[23:30.150 --> 23:33.670]  fucking give those seeds away. Give them to the birds, flush them, or let your
[23:33.670 --> 23:37.110]  friends grow them for free, but don't charge them for them and let them know,
[23:37.110 --> 23:40.550]  hey, these are kind of some B-grade seeds, but they're free. People don't mind
[23:40.550 --> 23:44.150]  free shit if it's kind of B-grade. All right, where are we? Don't be stubborn.
[23:44.150 --> 23:48.630]  Have some goals and some standards. Only you know if you have met your goals and
[23:48.630 --> 23:51.910]  if you are accepting your standards. Write down some goals. Write down some
[23:51.910 --> 23:55.270]  plans. Write down some predictions. See if you're meeting your goals. See if you
[23:55.270 --> 23:59.750]  are correct with your hypothesis when it comes to growing out your progeny.
[23:59.750 --> 24:03.910]  Where are we? There's more to go. A lot of people are intimidated by breeding.
[24:03.910 --> 24:07.750]  A lot of people think that they've got to have some gigantic space for breeding.
[24:07.750 --> 24:12.470]  You can do a lot of work in a very small space. You can grow plants out and find
[24:12.470 --> 24:17.270]  a male in one-gallon pots. You could do it in a cup if you really wanted. Sprout
[24:17.270 --> 24:21.270]  your seed. Grow it until it's, what's that, four, five, maybe six inches tall.
[24:21.270 --> 24:24.550]  Put it into flower. They'll go into flower in like 14 days. You could find
[24:24.550 --> 24:27.910]  out if you've got boys or girls at that point. At that point, you can choose if
[24:27.910 --> 24:31.270]  you want to put them back into veg or you can keep flowering them. You can
[24:31.270 --> 24:34.630]  reveg them when you're done. We've talked about this before. You do not need
[24:34.630 --> 24:38.870]  a lot of space to make seeds. Once you've got a male selected, you can put a
[24:38.870 --> 24:42.630]  couple of females or one female in a one-gallon pot. You could put that male
[24:42.630 --> 24:46.470]  plant in a one-gallon pot. Put them in a very small two-by-two room with a very
[24:46.470 --> 24:49.990]  small light. Put them into flower. They'll make seeds very easily, very
[24:49.990 --> 24:53.590]  naturally. You don't need a lot of space. It doesn't take a lot of setup. As long
[24:53.590 --> 24:57.350]  as you don't get the pollen to the plants you don't want seeded, that is the
[24:57.350 --> 25:02.710]  main concern. I stagger my crops. If I'm breeding in a small space, the pollen
[25:02.710 --> 25:06.870]  crop is happening. The next crop is in veg. That way I don't pollinate my
[25:06.870 --> 25:10.470]  seedless, my scenty crop. My smoke crop doesn't get seeded because I just
[25:10.470 --> 25:14.790]  simply stagger them. You can make a little two-by-two space. Put two plants
[25:14.790 --> 25:18.230]  in there. Put them on a date, bro. Let them do their thing. Make some seeds. You
[25:18.230 --> 25:22.710]  don't need all of the space that people assume they need. I think that wraps up.
[25:22.710 --> 25:26.710]  Oh, I was going to say father plants, male plants kind of make the breeder. We
[25:26.790 --> 25:30.070]  all know that I'm known for, maybe we don't all know, we do by now, I am known
[25:30.070 --> 25:34.470]  for the King Solomon male. Subcool was known for his Jack the Ripper male. A lot
[25:34.470 --> 25:38.470]  of people are just known for their very popular male plants. That's kind of what
[25:38.470 --> 25:41.670]  sets the breeders apart. That's kind of what makes their standards. I know that
[25:41.670 --> 25:45.990]  seedsherenow.com will not sell your seeds. If you just took, like so if you
[25:45.990 --> 25:50.230]  were to buy a pack of Arise and just use my Arise male and pollinate a bunch of
[25:50.230 --> 25:54.470]  shit, James Bean won't accept you as a vendor. You actually have to take my
[25:54.550 --> 25:57.990]  Arise and breed it to something and then pull your own male out of there. You've
[25:57.990 --> 26:01.910]  got to do a little bit of work is what we call it. So make your own male, find
[26:01.910 --> 26:05.430]  your own male plant. Don't just, you can, but don't just accept pollen or male
[26:05.430 --> 26:08.550]  plants as gifts from people. I think it's very important to do a thorough
[26:08.550 --> 26:13.750]  selection process for a male plant. All right. I think that is my lesson on male
[26:13.750 --> 26:16.870]  plants. I wanted to do that because in the future we're going to talk about
[26:16.870 --> 26:21.510]  reversing a male plant. I did the episode on reversing females. A lot of people
[26:21.510 --> 26:25.430]  said, Hey, can you do this to a boy? You absolutely can. That is a full other
[26:25.430 --> 26:29.990]  podcast. Stay tuned. That will be coming in the very near future. This is a
[26:29.990 --> 26:34.230]  subtle reminder for all you potheads out there. Mother's day is coming Sunday.
[26:34.230 --> 26:37.670]  This episode will come out on Thursday. Sunday is mother's day. So if you got
[26:37.670 --> 26:41.430]  someone to get some flowers for someone to give some thanks to, this is a fair
[26:41.430 --> 26:45.350]  warning from your stoner friend. Mother's day is coming. You guys don't forget
[26:45.350 --> 26:48.150]  mama. All right. That is all I've got for you for this episode. Let's start
