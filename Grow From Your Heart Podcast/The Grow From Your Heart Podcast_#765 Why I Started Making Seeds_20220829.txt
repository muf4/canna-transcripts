[01:54.400 --> 01:57.920]  following along with the show, you know that I did experience the plague. I'm
[01:57.920 --> 02:01.280]  recovering. I've still got this junk in my throat. The energy still kind of
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.840]  fluctuates but I feel much better. I'm much better in spirits. I feel way like
[02:05.840 --> 02:09.040]  I'm almost back but I can't just get rid of this. You can hear it in my voice. I
[02:09.040 --> 02:12.600]  can hear it. It's much much more exaggerated when I get the microphone and
[02:12.600 --> 02:17.040]  headphones going. But I think I'm mostly back. Thank you to everybody who has been
[02:17.040 --> 02:21.760]  sending me messages, well wishes, ideas for things that will help me get over
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.480]  this. I do appreciate most of that. Some of you guys are crazy but most of you
[02:25.480 --> 02:29.360]  are sending great ideas. Thank you for all of the love, encouragement, support,
[02:29.560 --> 02:32.760]  the kindness. A lot of people said, hey bro, we understand you're sick. Take your
[02:32.760 --> 02:36.400]  time. I am doing just that. You may notice that the podcast went from two
[02:36.400 --> 02:41.000]  episodes a week to one episode. My lungs get really tired just talking through a
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.960]  whole podcast. That sounds ridiculous to me. That sounds crazy. I'm a mostly
[02:44.960 --> 02:49.000]  healthy dude. I'm active. I run around. I talk a lot. And now for my lungs to get
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.080]  tired doing a podcast feels ridiculous to me honestly. So I've got to take my
[02:53.080 --> 02:57.920]  time. Got to pace myself. Can't bang out two shows like I used to. Excuse me for
[02:57.960 --> 03:00.800]  hearing the junk. If you do hear the junk in my throat, I apologize. I'm doing
[03:00.800 --> 03:03.400]  my best. I'm back on the mic. We're going to have a good time. Let's quit
[03:03.400 --> 03:06.040]  talking about my health. Nobody cares about the plague. Some of you do. Thank
[03:06.040 --> 03:08.920]  you for the folks that sent me messages. Most of you guys out there don't want to
[03:08.920 --> 03:13.880]  hear me talk about my health. I said we have a fun podcast lined up. I was sent
[03:13.880 --> 03:18.120]  a very good question just from a friend actually from my friends at Lollipop
[03:18.120 --> 03:21.520]  Farm. Shout out to Lolly. Shout out to John at Lollipop Farms. Beautiful people
[03:21.520 --> 03:24.600]  up there. I don't need to mention their location or anything else about them.
[03:24.600 --> 03:27.160]  They know who they are. They know that I got nothing but love and respect for
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.400]  everybody up there. They asked me and maybe a pod, they sent me a text message
[03:31.400 --> 03:35.000]  and said it may be a good idea if you talk about how and why you got into
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.520]  breeding. I realize I've probably done that on this podcast, but there are 765
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.080]  episodes up and maybe you didn't see the episode where I talked about it. It's
[03:44.080 --> 03:48.560]  probably been 300 episodes or so. So here we are. I don't want to try to put
[03:48.560 --> 03:53.560]  out a lot of grow information right now because since the plague hit me, my
[03:53.600 --> 03:56.760]  attention span is not where it should be. So I don't want to try to give you grow
[03:56.760 --> 04:00.480]  information, lots of detailed information with weeks and numbers and
[04:00.480 --> 04:04.200]  times and things like that that I could definitely flub and mess up right now.
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.120]  So I want to just kind of ramble for another episode or two and just talk
[04:07.120 --> 04:10.680]  about things that I can flow about and I can talk about. So I'm going to just
[04:10.680 --> 04:14.360]  talk about how I got into breeding on this episode. This is a personal story.
[04:14.360 --> 04:17.920]  We can't make mistakes here. If I do make errors or mistakes, somebody do
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.840]  correct me and remind me of how the story really went. But this won't mess
[04:21.840 --> 04:24.920]  up your garden in any way and it will be a fun episode for everybody to be
[04:24.920 --> 04:28.960]  involved in. So with no further ado, let's jump into a little bit about how
[04:28.960 --> 04:34.840]  and why I got into growing and breeding and how we got where we are. Many, many
[04:34.840 --> 04:40.080]  years ago, um, I was around growing before I should, should have been
[04:40.080 --> 04:43.600]  before. I should probably admit it. Probably statue of limitations are over.
[04:43.880 --> 04:48.480]  But I remember being a little kid and one of my uncles was growing cannabis
[04:48.480 --> 04:52.720]  in a backyard and another uncle said, hey bro, tonight when the sun goes down,
[04:52.960 --> 04:56.040]  do this. And he gave specific instructions. It was 40 years ago. I
[04:56.040 --> 05:00.040]  don't remember it. 35 years ago. I don't remember it. Um, so we gave uncle,
[05:00.080 --> 05:03.760]  uncle a gave uncle B instructions. Names will be changed to protect the
[05:03.760 --> 05:07.160]  innocent here. Um, and rest in peace to the uncles that are gone. Damn it. I
[05:07.160 --> 05:11.800]  miss you guys. Um, uncle gave uncle instructions. The sun went down. Uncle
[05:11.800 --> 05:15.680]  went outside to do the thing and he was about to do it wrong. And me being just
[05:15.760 --> 05:19.240]  the little kid that I was, the PR, I was this person when I was a little kid,
[05:19.240 --> 05:22.800]  but I was like, Hey uncle, that's not what he said. He said to do it this way.
[05:23.120 --> 05:26.520]  And my mom was standing there. My uncle was standing there. Our other family
[05:26.520 --> 05:30.200]  friend who I was named after was standing there. Um, and they're all like,
[05:30.240 --> 05:34.840]  Oh shit, he's right. That's what he said. And this was the time before like text
[05:34.840 --> 05:37.920]  messages and Google and shit. We didn't have none of that. This was the eighties
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.360]  bro. So we had to just trust and rely on that. When I said that was wrong. And I
[05:42.360 --> 05:46.000]  said the correct way, like he is right. Uh, that was the first time I remember
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.360]  being around somebody growing cannabis. I didn't realize at the time what was
[05:49.360 --> 05:54.000]  happening, but they were growing cannabis in the backyard at that time. Um,
[05:54.440 --> 05:58.280]  fast forward to, I moved to another location. I don't want to give too many
[05:58.280 --> 06:01.840]  details because, um, I moved to a place where cultivating cannabis, it was
[06:01.840 --> 06:08.760]  illegal. And I accidentally spotted a friend's cultivation in their, um, their
[06:08.760 --> 06:11.760]  place. They had a place. I don't want to give too many details, but I was
[06:11.760 --> 06:16.000]  somewhere and from above light hit me in the eye that shouldn't have been
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.840]  coming from somewhere. And I was like, what the fuck was that? And so I just
[06:18.840 --> 06:21.480]  kind of, I was playing the drums to tell you the truth. I was playing the drums.
[06:21.600 --> 06:24.600]  So I was obviously in a place where we played the drums and light hit me where
[06:24.600 --> 06:27.320]  it shouldn't have. And then I realized I was like, Oh, that's a fucking grow
[06:27.320 --> 06:30.880]  light. So after we were fucking, after we got done, I can't give too many
[06:30.880 --> 06:33.600]  details. I don't want to bust anybody after we got done playing music, I guess
[06:33.600 --> 06:37.080]  is what I could say. Um, I told my friend, I was like, Hey bro, I can kind
[06:37.080 --> 06:40.400]  of tell that you got lights coming from up there. You might want to seal that up
[06:40.400 --> 06:42.960]  a little bit. And he goes, bro, do you know what you're doing? I go, I kind of
[06:42.960 --> 06:45.440]  know about growing and he goes, come here, I got to show you some shit. And
[06:45.440 --> 06:48.480]  he showed me his grow. And I was like, Oh, this is what I think is wrong. And
[06:48.480 --> 06:51.280]  so I helped him. So we go up there, we take a look at the grow. I kind of
[06:51.280 --> 06:54.520]  helped him figure out what was wrong. And then he needed a helper. He just was
[06:54.520 --> 06:57.480]  in over his head. He needed a buddy that could do it since I'd already
[06:57.480 --> 07:00.560]  discovered it. And I was cool about it. He just decided that we were also
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.400]  friends also. So he decided that I was going to be his, his bucket helper, his
[07:04.400 --> 07:08.840]  bucket monkey. Uh, basically I carried buckets up a ladder to, uh, upstairs and
[07:08.840 --> 07:12.520]  did weird shit like that. And then he had to go out of town surprisingly. And
[07:12.520 --> 07:16.000]  when he went out of town, I just took over and ran that grow. He came back for
[07:16.000 --> 07:19.640]  harvest and then paid me pretty well. But that was one of my first experiences
[07:19.640 --> 07:22.800]  of running a grow by myself is when he went out of town, shout out bro. If you
[07:22.800 --> 07:26.560]  hear this, hope things are well, uh, hope you're killing it. Um, but that dude
[07:26.560 --> 07:30.000]  went out of town. I kind of took over that grow. So eventually I had to leave
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.880]  that prohibition state and I had to come back to Colorado. When I came back to
[07:33.880 --> 07:37.240]  Colorado, everybody was talking about medical marijuana. One of the first
[07:37.240 --> 07:41.120]  things I did was get my medical marijuana recommendation from a doctor
[07:41.120 --> 07:45.500]  and get all set up to be able to shop at dispensaries. Having this medical
[07:45.500 --> 07:50.640]  marijuana card also gave me the ability to grow my own cannabis. I'd already
[07:50.640 --> 07:53.640]  been growing with my friends in another state. I'd grown a little bit when I was
[07:53.640 --> 07:57.440]  younger, so I had some experience. I thought I could definitely do this. And
[07:57.440 --> 08:01.680]  it was a huge market here in Colorado. Everybody needed medical marijuana, but
[08:01.680 --> 08:04.680]  there weren't enough people growing it. And if you could grow a good product
[08:04.680 --> 08:08.460]  reliably, people would be knocking down your door in a good way. That sounds
[08:08.460 --> 08:12.920]  bad, but it was a good way this time. So I was, I decided I'm going to grow
[08:12.940 --> 08:17.080]  some medical marijuana. Unfortunately, it takes a little while to grow some
[08:17.080 --> 08:20.160]  medical marijuana. You can't just start growing. You got to get some clones from
[08:20.160 --> 08:23.280]  somewhere. So this is where the story kind of branches off in a couple of
[08:23.280 --> 08:27.640]  different things happen. Um, I ordered seeds from a seed bank, shout out to the
[08:27.640 --> 08:31.240]  seed banks out there that keep people supplied with seeds, wanted to grow
[08:31.360 --> 08:37.720]  ordered seeds, um, had somewhat okay, somewhat not okay experiences with seeds.
[08:37.720 --> 08:41.520]  Also at the same time, since it's taking a while to grow, I'm shopping at
[08:41.520 --> 08:44.900]  dispensaries and I'm looking for quality products and I'm just shopping
[08:44.900 --> 08:48.840]  around. While I'm shopping around, I realized there's not a quality dispensary
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.880]  in my area. So this branches out how, uh, buying seeds and being dissatisfied
[08:54.080 --> 08:57.560]  leads me to making my own seeds. And then at the same time, shopping
[08:57.560 --> 09:01.720]  dispensaries, looking for quality products leads me to finding a group of
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.400]  friends where I was part of opening the first dispensary in the city of Pueblo.
[09:06.400 --> 09:10.200]  So that's two different branches of this story that kind of put us where we are
[09:10.280 --> 09:14.640]  on the map of being a breeder and a commercial grower. So let's go the way
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.520]  of, I've got some notes here. Let's talk about it this way. I was growing for
[09:17.520 --> 09:21.240]  myself and then I found this group of friends that wanted to start a
[09:21.240 --> 09:25.160]  dispensary that had a great idea. They had a good strategy, but they just
[09:25.160 --> 09:28.840]  didn't have the, the oomph. They didn't know they were older than me as the
[09:28.840 --> 09:32.840]  bottom line. No disrespect to the elders. This was probably, this was in 2008.
[09:32.840 --> 09:36.840]  So it's been several years. I am their age now. So I've grown into that, but
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.360]  they were older and didn't have the energy, the hipness, the enthusiasm that
[09:40.360 --> 09:43.000]  they needed, but they had most of the other things. They had the product and
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.440]  the building. They needed a guy like myself. I've been going to dispensaries
[09:47.440 --> 09:50.720]  all over the state of Colorado. I've seen things that I liked. I've seen
[09:50.720 --> 09:53.800]  things that I did not like. I've seen what I thought worked and did not work.
[09:54.080 --> 09:58.000]  I come from a retail background, so I understood this going to the dispensaries.
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.200]  I understood what I was looking at, what I was seeing, how I interacted with
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.720]  people, what I liked in the interactions and didn't like how the stores were set
[10:04.720 --> 10:07.920]  up, the products I enjoyed. I learned all of this. So when I discovered this
[10:07.920 --> 10:11.480]  group of people in my neighborhood that wanted to start a dispensary and they
[10:11.480 --> 10:15.000]  were a little slow about it, I was like, I'm the guy you need. And then I put my
[10:15.000 --> 10:20.080]  young energy, my young creativity into that. And we started a very flourishing
[10:20.120 --> 10:23.880]  dispensary. We had a great facility here in Colorado, here in Pueblo.
[10:23.960 --> 10:29.360]  Unfortunately, we were shut down for illegal zoning, but they built that rule
[10:29.360 --> 10:32.960]  around us. They zoned us out because they did not want us there in that part of
[10:32.960 --> 10:36.880]  town. That's a whole other story. I may talk about that at another part of the
[10:36.880 --> 10:40.480]  show, but I was growing seed. I was growing for this dispensary and I was
[10:40.480 --> 10:46.160]  growing for myself. So I did acquire some clones. I got some clones from some
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.480]  neighborhood friends and I grew those. I ordered some seeds. They came. So what
[10:50.480 --> 10:53.520]  inspired me to get seeds was the dispensary and everybody in my
[10:53.520 --> 10:57.560]  neighborhood had the same clones. My dispensary was selling clones to people.
[10:57.800 --> 11:01.400]  So the dispensary had all the same weed in the neighborhood, all had the same
[11:01.400 --> 11:05.160]  weed because we were just selling clones like crazy. So all the growers in the
[11:05.160 --> 11:08.800]  neighborhood came to my dispensary and got clones of the same shit that I was
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.840]  growing at work. So it was just all the same shit. And I was trying to sell on
[11:12.840 --> 11:15.880]  the black market as well. I had my own side hustle going and we wanted to stay
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.480]  fresh at the dispensary. So we had to separate ourselves. The way to do that
[11:19.480 --> 11:24.160]  was to get a bunch of seeds. So I bought a lot of seeds. I used my own money and
[11:24.160 --> 11:27.600]  did my own pheno hunts at home in my own personal grow. Then I would take the
[11:27.600 --> 11:32.760]  winners from that to the commercial grow that we had at the store. Which route do
[11:32.760 --> 11:36.840]  we talk about that right now? I would just buy seeds and grow them. I started
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.160]  growing at home and the seeds would come and I would grow them at home and I would
[11:40.160 --> 11:43.800]  pheno hunt them. I'd get a pack of seeds and find the best one. Then I would take
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.600]  that to the commercial grow. That commercial grow is where I learned how
[11:47.600 --> 11:51.760]  to grow on a big level. It wasn't necessarily a commercial building. It
[11:51.760 --> 11:55.960]  wasn't set up right. It was before commercial grows were really happening.
[11:55.960 --> 11:59.720]  It was kind of right before that. But it was as big as I had been in and we made
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.880]  a lot of flower come out of that room. So I had to run a lot of lights, a lot of
[12:03.880 --> 12:07.280]  plants by myself. That started me in a big grow. I had that one. I had the one at
[12:07.280 --> 12:11.280]  home. Allegedly, maybe, possibly had a couple others in other places we
[12:11.280 --> 12:14.880]  shouldn't talk about. But that's what got me going on commercial growing and in
[12:14.880 --> 12:19.920]  a dispensary environment. Then ordering those seeds is another part of this big
[12:19.920 --> 12:26.440]  story. Some of those seeds I bought were awesome. Some were terrible. The ratio of
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.360]  fucking awesome to fucking terrible seeds was not worth buying more seeds. So
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.400]  I did what any good grower would do. I took some of the best seeds. I actually
[12:35.400 --> 12:39.240]  made friends with some growers. Some other breeders online. I would start
[12:39.280 --> 12:42.560]  posting pictures of my grow, of my stuff that I was growing from seed and from
[12:42.560 --> 12:47.480]  clone. People took notice. Other people started sending me seeds. I took some
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.120]  seeds from some other really reputable, popular breeders. I would cross them and
[12:52.120 --> 12:56.360]  make other things. Then I realized I can make better seeds than what I am buying.
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.880]  I just have to do research. I have to do a little bit of work. I can make enough
[12:59.880 --> 13:04.840]  seeds for myself to grow and have better seeds than what I'm spending hundreds of
[13:04.840 --> 13:08.800]  dollars for coming from websites. Back then, you had to buy all the seed banks
[13:08.840 --> 13:13.480]  were in Canada or in Europe. You'd have to hope your shit got over the border
[13:13.480 --> 13:16.440]  through customs. They'd go through your package. A lot of times you'd get a
[13:16.440 --> 13:19.280]  package that had been cut open and there's a letter inside of it that said,
[13:19.280 --> 13:22.560]  nice try. We took your seeds. You can't have those. Sometimes you'd get your
[13:22.560 --> 13:25.800]  shit. Sometimes you wouldn't. Sometimes you'd pay for the money back guarantee
[13:25.800 --> 13:28.760]  and you'd get your money back. You wouldn't get the shipping fees. You
[13:28.760 --> 13:31.840]  wouldn't get a half of your shit back. That's just how it went back in the day.
[13:31.840 --> 13:35.840]  So I made my own seeds. I didn't want to keep spending money on seeds when I knew
[13:36.080 --> 13:39.320]  I could do it myself just as good as the guys on the internet. Why couldn't I?
[13:39.320 --> 13:43.360]  I'm a smart dude. I had the experience, the space, uh, the encouragement, the
[13:43.520 --> 13:48.440]  buck and the drive to do it. So I made my own seeds. Um, so I did it. I made a
[13:48.440 --> 13:53.480]  few crosses. Uh, I made a feminized cross. I made a batch of feminized seeds that
[13:53.640 --> 13:56.960]  I grew. And when I started posting pictures, people are like, dude, that's
[13:56.960 --> 14:00.200]  fire. That looks really good. And when my friends would smoke it and grow it. Uh,
[14:00.200 --> 14:04.680]  so I bred some grateful dog and I took it to a party here and it was the first
[14:04.720 --> 14:07.600]  batch that I thought was dried and cured properly enough to take some more and
[14:07.600 --> 14:11.720]  smoke it. And I cracked open the jar and everybody at the outside of the party on
[14:11.720 --> 14:15.560]  the back porch where I was, everybody for about a 10 or 12, maybe 15 foot radius
[14:15.560 --> 14:18.880]  just came right to me like a bunch of cockroaches. Like what kind of weed is
[14:18.880 --> 14:22.800]  that bro? And I cracked it open. I rolled a fat bowl, a rolled a fat joint,
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.840]  packed a couple of bowls and we all smoked. And I knew that that weed was
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.800]  super special and I'd made seeds of that. So I had some seeds of it. I packaged up
[14:29.800 --> 14:33.440]  a bunch of those and there was a cannabis cup coming to Denver. I don't
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.640]  remember. I think it may have been the first one at that place with the
[14:37.680 --> 14:40.680]  outdoor. Maybe it was Denver Mart. It could have been the Xdo. I don't remember
[14:40.680 --> 14:43.680]  what year it was. I've got a brain injury in this shit. I didn't know to
[14:43.680 --> 14:46.600]  document this. I didn't know it was going to be some sort of historical event
[14:46.600 --> 14:50.400]  for me. I was just doing what I was doing. So I made a bunch of seeds and I
[14:50.400 --> 14:55.720]  took them to the cannabis cup and on those seed packages I just put, um, I was
[14:55.720 --> 14:59.080]  calling myself I read genetics already. I just decided it was, that was a cool
[14:59.080 --> 15:02.440]  name. So I put, I read genetics and then I put the name of the strain on the
[15:02.440 --> 15:06.000]  cross and I put my email address on there cause I didn't have a website yet.
[15:06.320 --> 15:09.640]  And at the cannabis cup, anybody that had, if you're walking around with like
[15:09.640 --> 15:13.760]  a bottle of nutrients or a grow light or like a pot or maybe some soil,
[15:13.920 --> 15:16.920]  anything that indicated to me that you were going to go home and attempt to
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.640]  grow cannabis, I gave you seeds. I thought that was a great, uh, just a
[15:20.640 --> 15:24.240]  freebie for me to give to you. I didn't ask for money. It was a good way to get
[15:24.280 --> 15:27.720]  seeds in people's hands. My idea was just, I made a lot of these seeds. I need
[15:27.720 --> 15:32.040]  to grow maybe a hundred of them. You guys can have the other 2,400 that I made
[15:32.040 --> 15:35.600]  and I put them out there for the world. Uh, so I gave a bunch of those away with
[15:35.600 --> 15:40.760]  my info on the packages. It took a while. I think a lot of those people sat on
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.520]  those seeds for a minute, but then eventually I takes four or five, maybe
[15:44.520 --> 15:48.120]  six months to get the grow finished. Eventually, six, eight months later,
[15:48.120 --> 15:51.520]  people started messaging me and they're like, Hey bro, I grew these seeds.
[15:51.520 --> 15:55.040]  Here's pictures. And the pictures would look stellar. And those people would say,
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.320]  can I get more seeds from you? And I would politely say, yes you can. But this
[15:59.320 --> 16:03.240]  time they may cost a little bit of money. So I started posting around social
[16:03.240 --> 16:07.840]  media. Um, I started going to more cannabis cups and more events and started
[16:07.840 --> 16:11.080]  breeding more, learning more about breeding. People started giving me plants
[16:11.080 --> 16:14.800]  they thought would breed. Well, breeders started sending me seeds and cuts, uh,
[16:14.800 --> 16:19.160]  made a name for myself in that industry. Then when I went to more cannabis cups,
[16:19.160 --> 16:22.720]  people would hunt me down and try to give me money for seeds. I actually got,
[16:23.080 --> 16:27.040]  uh, politely asked to stop selling or leave a cannabis cup. I had a backpack
[16:27.040 --> 16:29.800]  filled with seeds. People would run up and I just take their money,
[16:29.800 --> 16:33.400]  give them seeds. And then some of the high time staff thought that that was bad,
[16:33.400 --> 16:36.920]  that I was selling without a booth. I agree. I should get my own booth and sell.
[16:36.920 --> 16:40.520]  So that's what I'm doing now. I get the boots at the events, sell seeds there.
[16:40.840 --> 16:44.520]  Um, eventually I built a website and it wasn't the best website,
[16:44.520 --> 16:46.880]  but that was my way of starting to build a brand.
[16:46.880 --> 16:49.760]  I built a website and a social media presence, uh,
[16:49.800 --> 16:53.240]  started doing a lot of online and live stuff. And that's a lot of why I think
[16:53.240 --> 16:55.840]  that's why people trust me is because I'm right here. You could see my face.
[16:55.880 --> 16:58.160]  I'm wearing a bright yellow shirt with a purple background.
[16:58.440 --> 17:01.160]  I'm six five with dreadlocks to my knees, to my ankles.
[17:01.280 --> 17:02.480]  They're almost touching the floor right now.
[17:02.480 --> 17:05.640]  I'm in like a bar stool height chair and they, um, they're touching my shoes.
[17:05.640 --> 17:07.600]  I could feel it, but, uh, I'm right here.
[17:07.600 --> 17:11.160]  That's why I think a lot of people support the brand and support me because I
[17:11.160 --> 17:13.920]  support you back. And I don't hide a lot of breeders.
[17:14.040 --> 17:16.440]  You don't even know who they are. You have no idea what they're about.
[17:16.440 --> 17:18.240]  You know me, I'm friendly, I'm peaceful.
[17:18.440 --> 17:21.760]  I think building an audience with the social media folks, doing a podcast,
[17:21.760 --> 17:24.520]  that really helps out just showing you that I'm a normal person.
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.680]  I'm passionate for cannabis and, uh, kind of opening up the window,
[17:28.680 --> 17:30.640]  the curtain, I guess, so that you could see what I'm doing.
[17:30.640 --> 17:32.880]  I talk about my breeding. I share a lot with you.
[17:32.880 --> 17:35.800]  I think that really helps with my brand. So, um,
[17:35.840 --> 17:38.000]  that's a lot of what got me here. I started doing events.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.760]  I got my own booth set up, started selling at shows, and then, um,
[17:42.040 --> 17:44.360]  still sell at the events when they do happen. Uh,
[17:44.400 --> 17:48.320]  the endo expo got canceled and then the next event that was lined up was the dude
[17:48.320 --> 17:51.720]  grows cup. Unfortunately I had to skip that because I had the vid.
[17:51.720 --> 17:54.920]  I did send Mike in place to do work for me. Great job, Mike.
[17:54.920 --> 17:57.120]  I am rambling like crazy, but I'm telling a story, bro.
[17:57.120 --> 17:59.000]  This is story time with Rasta Jeff.
[17:59.080 --> 18:01.560]  So now I make a lot of feminized and regular seeds.
[18:01.560 --> 18:03.800]  My fem seeds seem to be quite reliable.
[18:03.800 --> 18:07.040]  My regular seeds seem to be quite potent. Um,
[18:07.320 --> 18:10.960]  I don't follow a lot of the trends and the hype of what I see in the market.
[18:10.960 --> 18:13.240]  You don't usually see me work with, uh,
[18:13.240 --> 18:17.120]  hate to be naming things, but like the Skittles and the cake and the gelato,
[18:17.140 --> 18:19.200]  you never saw me do stuff with a lot of that.
[18:19.600 --> 18:22.480]  I try to stay away from the trends and I just do. Um,
[18:22.720 --> 18:25.400]  my motto has always been grow from your heart and breathe with love.
[18:25.400 --> 18:26.480]  When I see two plants,
[18:26.480 --> 18:30.080]  I just know that this plant needs to donate Paul into this plant.
[18:30.080 --> 18:32.880]  They need to make little babies. I could just see it. Uh,
[18:32.900 --> 18:36.240]  maybe I'm a matchmaker. Maybe I'm a plant porn director. Either way,
[18:36.240 --> 18:40.040]  it just feels natural. It's what I think I was a part of what I was born to do.
[18:40.040 --> 18:43.440]  One of the things I was put here to do. So that's how we got started.
[18:43.440 --> 18:45.840]  That's how I became Rasta Jeff, the breeder. Uh,
[18:45.840 --> 18:50.840]  I was basically tired of buying seeds that were not quality that did not reach
[18:51.440 --> 18:55.400]  my expectations and for paying ridiculous prices for things that had to get
[18:55.400 --> 18:58.600]  shipped from another country that are being made in America. Uh,
[18:58.760 --> 19:01.480]  the companies would be that have California and the name,
[19:01.760 --> 19:04.120]  and they'd say like New York and the name.
[19:04.120 --> 19:06.720]  And those people would ship their seeds overseas.
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.800]  And then I would pay money to have them fucking shipped back to me.
[19:09.820 --> 19:11.880]  And then half of them wouldn't be good. I'm not dissing any,
[19:11.880 --> 19:14.400]  either of those companies. I'm just saying they would,
[19:14.400 --> 19:17.120]  we know they're coming from America and they're shipping it to another country,
[19:17.120 --> 19:18.640]  then shipping it right back. And I've got to,
[19:19.040 --> 19:22.560]  it gets taken in customs and that was just a pain in the ass. So, um,
[19:22.600 --> 19:26.040]  that's a lot of what led me to making my own seeds. I could do it.
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.200]  We can all do it. I encourage you. I'm a seed maker. I'm a seed seller,
[19:29.220 --> 19:32.240]  but still, if you find something stellar, make some crosses.
[19:32.240 --> 19:35.240]  And I do encourage you, uh, promote you. Um,
[19:35.260 --> 19:37.800]  you're allowed to breed with the seeds that you get from me.
[19:37.800 --> 19:40.840]  I didn't invent cannabis. I didn't fart one day and have fresh seeds.
[19:41.080 --> 19:42.440]  I didn't sneeze and make a clone.
[19:42.640 --> 19:45.880]  I started with other people's genetics, just like all other breeders do.
[19:45.880 --> 19:48.200]  So you've got my permission, breed with my stuff.
[19:48.200 --> 19:49.820]  If you do breed with my genetics,
[19:49.820 --> 19:54.000]  all I ask is that you put the name of the cross that you used on the package and
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.620]  give me a little bit of credit. Maybe send me a 10 or 20 pack of seeds.
[19:57.620 --> 19:59.580]  I might grow them. Some of my friends might grow them.
[19:59.580 --> 20:04.440]  You may see pictures of your seeds on my Instagram page. That's always fun.
[20:05.040 --> 20:07.800]  So if you got like strawberry starburst cross to your,
[20:08.000 --> 20:11.640]  whatever you got mail or whatever you got, I may be interested in those seeds.
[20:11.640 --> 20:14.280]  It could be fun. Do that. You've got my permission.
[20:14.520 --> 20:17.560]  So I talked about how I got into it. Basically I was buying seeds,
[20:17.840 --> 20:20.960]  not happy with them. Uh, got into the dispensary life.
[20:21.080 --> 20:22.640]  Let's talk a little bit about that.
[20:22.640 --> 20:26.120]  The commercial growing started at a dispensary.
[20:26.120 --> 20:28.940]  We had a multi-level building. The bottom was a dispensary.
[20:28.940 --> 20:32.200]  The next two levels were straight up a production grow.
[20:32.200 --> 20:36.600]  We do smaller stuff in one area, carry it up to another area, flower it up there.
[20:37.080 --> 20:40.720]  Uh, that was an amazing, um, experience. It was an amazing, uh,
[20:40.760 --> 20:45.040]  cultivation facility made out of a retail store is basically what that was.
[20:45.440 --> 20:49.240]  So eventually that place did get closed down. Unfortunately, um,
[20:49.280 --> 20:51.760]  the city attorney and some law enforcement came,
[20:52.040 --> 20:55.640]  handed us some documents and said we had to close. Uh, a lot of people,
[20:55.640 --> 20:57.760]  when those people, when the law enforcement came in,
[20:57.760 --> 21:00.520]  they did not have their firearms out, they were not doing a raid.
[21:00.720 --> 21:04.960]  They were simply escorting. The law enforcement was escorting the city attorney,
[21:05.280 --> 21:07.760]  city attorney handed paper, paper was signed. And they said,
[21:07.760 --> 21:11.320]  you guys are now not allowed to sell any cannabis related products.
[21:11.600 --> 21:15.160]  The next question was, well, can we sell non? Well, what about, no,
[21:15.160 --> 21:15.760]  they said they have to,
[21:15.760 --> 21:19.200]  you have to lock the door and stop selling cannabis related products. And I said,
[21:19.200 --> 21:22.480]  what about the people in line? And they said, we don't know about them.
[21:22.480 --> 21:25.360]  We don't know what to tell you. And they left after we signed the papers,
[21:25.360 --> 21:28.560]  those last few people that didn't get up and run when the cops came in,
[21:28.560 --> 21:29.760]  when the city attorney came in,
[21:30.040 --> 21:33.040]  guess how much cannabis they got for the money that they brought that day.
[21:33.040 --> 21:34.320]  They came to buy a 20 bag.
[21:34.440 --> 21:36.840]  They probably left with an ounce each for a very cheap,
[21:36.840 --> 21:39.760]  because they stuck around when the cops walked in and they didn't get up and
[21:39.760 --> 21:43.400]  bail. We thought that was respectable, respectful and commendable.
[21:43.400 --> 21:45.920]  So they got hooked up, but they did close this. They closed this,
[21:45.920 --> 21:48.920]  like I said earlier for zoning violations. Um,
[21:49.480 --> 21:52.120]  so at that point we had to figure out stuff on our own.
[21:52.360 --> 21:55.840]  And that's kind of when I started doing a commercial growing at other places,
[21:55.840 --> 21:58.760]  drifting around, I worked at a, another commercial grow.
[21:58.760 --> 22:01.400]  They never really got off the ground. We helped them build it. Uh,
[22:01.440 --> 22:03.080]  but they always had technical difficulties.
[22:03.080 --> 22:06.280]  Then I got called to go work at green and healthy kind of help get that grow
[22:06.280 --> 22:10.360]  going. Then from there, I think I ended up over at, uh, three rivers.
[22:10.560 --> 22:13.240]  Then I built a commercial, um, what's it called?
[22:13.240 --> 22:17.200]  A commercial consulting reputation and just started doing consulting at several
[22:17.200 --> 22:20.960]  facilities. Uh, those few places I mentioned were public. I was there.
[22:21.080 --> 22:22.640]  I'm allowed to talk about them. A lot of them,
[22:22.840 --> 22:24.920]  we signed nondisclosure agreements to where they can't,
[22:24.920 --> 22:26.320]  I can't even tell you that I worked there,
[22:26.520 --> 22:28.560]  but I worked at a lot of cool places in Colorado.
[22:28.680 --> 22:31.080]  So that's where I got to the commercial cultivation,
[22:31.080 --> 22:34.520]  learning how to do things on a totally different scale, different level, uh,
[22:34.520 --> 22:38.280]  fighting pests in a different way. So I think I rambled about the question.
[22:38.280 --> 22:41.480]  The question was, um, how and why did I get into breeding?
[22:41.760 --> 22:43.360]  I went quite a ways into that. Honestly,
[22:43.360 --> 22:46.120]  the bottom line was I was not satisfied with what I was buying.
[22:46.320 --> 22:50.240]  And I knew that I could create a quality product for myself. One day,
[22:50.240 --> 22:53.640]  the people at the dispensary, um, I brought them some of the flowers I grew.
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.320]  And they're like, bro, you grow a better herb than us. And I was like, thank you.
[22:56.320 --> 22:58.880]  That's all I wanted to hear. So that is the wrap up.
[22:58.880 --> 23:02.720]  I think that is all my voice and throat have got time for, for this episode.

[24:07.600 --> 24:10.600]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend, modern roots VA.
[24:10.800 --> 24:14.280]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
