[01:49.100 --> 01:54.100]  comments section with positive comments nothing but love nothing but positive comments. In a
[01:54.100 --> 01:57.860]  previous episode I did say I was getting some uh I wasn't reading the comments because I was
[01:57.860 --> 02:02.380]  getting some funky comments. You guys promised me that you would send so many positive comments
[02:02.380 --> 02:06.500]  that I didn't even notice the bullshit anymore. Mission accomplished. Thank you guys I do
[02:06.500 --> 02:10.540]  appreciate it. There are nothing but positive comments nothing but love in that YouTube
[02:10.540 --> 02:15.700]  comments section. I have gone back to read those. I have found a lot of great love in there. I do
[02:15.700 --> 02:20.700]  appreciate it. I will be reading the comments more. Thank you that did not go unnoticed. I asked for
[02:20.700 --> 02:26.260]  it. I got it. So thank you. I owe you a big thank you for that. Now also I want to do a recap from a
[02:26.260 --> 02:30.900]  previous episode. In the last episode I did talk about somebody's seedling. They planted a seedling.
[02:30.900 --> 02:35.940]  They had it in a container with their soil or their soilless mix. I said from the best of my
[02:35.940 --> 02:40.780]  knowledge from looking in my observations in the description that that plant was probably too wet
[02:40.780 --> 02:45.580]  and too cold. We did get an update. This one came from our friend and it said I just listened to the
[02:45.580 --> 02:50.100]  latest episode. Thank you for listening. It says awesome. I will send you an email this evening
[02:50.100 --> 02:56.100]  with more details but the show was very helpful and I think you were right too cold and too much
[02:56.100 --> 03:00.660]  water. So it's great to get some feedback when people agree. We know that we're actually helping
[03:00.660 --> 03:05.260]  people. When they say you were right that means we gave them a diagnosis. They know next time not to
[03:05.260 --> 03:09.780]  water so much maybe make it a little bit warmer. We are correcting gardens which is setting ourself
[03:09.780 --> 03:14.420]  up for success which is what we are all about here at the Grow From Your Heart podcast. So thank you
[03:14.420 --> 03:19.020]  for the great feedback. It does feel good to know that what I said the guidance I gave the advice
[03:19.020 --> 03:24.420]  that I offered was helpful and that the diagnosis I gave from what we've determined was probably
[03:24.420 --> 03:28.860]  correct. That does feels good to know that. I don't always know that the advice I give was accurate on
[03:28.860 --> 03:33.620]  here. I'm talking to a camera. It takes at least three or four days for me to get any feedback and
[03:33.620 --> 03:37.820]  a lot of times I really don't. So thank you for the great feedback. I'll quit rambling and move on
[03:37.820 --> 03:42.100]  with the show. I've been talking about a Black Friday sale. That's right if you've been paying
[03:42.100 --> 03:46.700]  attention you know that there is a Black Friday sale coming up on the iRegenetics merch store.
[03:46.700 --> 03:50.980]  Excuse me for that. I hope you didn't hear too much of that. Let me clear my throat. Anyway there
[03:50.980 --> 03:57.100]  is a Black Friday sale coming up on the iRegenetics merch store. If you go to iRegenetics.com click on
[03:57.100 --> 04:01.380]  the merch store it will take you right to the merch store where the t-shirts, stickers, trays,
[04:01.380 --> 04:06.100]  grinders, things like that they are there. There may be new merchandise very soon if it gets delivered
[04:06.100 --> 04:09.820]  this week as promised but check back on the website for the merch. You may find some new
[04:09.820 --> 04:13.780]  merchandise I did not mention here. However the point of this ramble is there is a Black Friday
[04:13.860 --> 04:19.580]  sale that will be happening November 25th through November 30th on the iRegenetics merch store.
[04:19.580 --> 04:24.420]  Again that is the t-shirts, stickers, not the other products that we do offer. That is the
[04:24.420 --> 04:29.020]  wearable and shareable merchandise. So check that out. The coupon code to get that merchandise at
[04:29.020 --> 04:37.140]  25% off will be GFYH25. That's it GFYH25 to make it easy to remember that stands for Grow From
[04:37.140 --> 04:44.660]  Your Heart 25. So GFYH25 will get you 25% off on the iRegenetics merch store on November 25th
[04:44.660 --> 04:50.780]  through the 30th. Alright now we can move on and get into the main part of this podcast episode. I
[04:50.780 --> 04:55.580]  do have a message from our friend Magic Mike here on Patreon. Big up to Magic Mike. Hope you're
[04:55.580 --> 05:00.100]  killing it. Thank you for the continued Patreon support. We'll get right to the question. It says
[05:00.100 --> 05:06.020]  I made a fatal mistake by mixing a tent with your starstruck. So we had a package of iRegenetics
[05:06.020 --> 05:13.100]  starstruck seeds and what he calls some knockoff genetics of GDP and runs. Normally when I'm
[05:13.100 --> 05:16.940]  talking about a growth that went wrong and somebody got seeds I do not mention the strains
[05:16.940 --> 05:22.460]  because it is not my job to, excuse me I'm not even gonna edit that I'm a human that happened
[05:22.460 --> 05:28.780]  my throat's clogged up today. It is not my job as a podcaster or a anybody to call out another seed
[05:28.780 --> 05:32.300]  brand unless they're doing something malicious unless they've got intent. We did call out one
[05:32.620 --> 05:36.540]  before for selling fake seeds that are not what they're claiming to be but that's not what this
[05:36.540 --> 05:41.260]  is about. Most of the time I don't say the strain names. The reason I did say that this was GDP and
[05:41.260 --> 05:46.060]  runs is because they said they got knockoff genetics. They didn't get these crosses from
[05:46.060 --> 05:50.220]  the original makers. So if you got knockoff genetics I'll say it was a knockoff of that.
[05:50.220 --> 05:55.740]  They didn't buy the real shit. So I'm not dissing whoever made GDP or whoever made the runs. They
[05:55.740 --> 06:00.140]  shouldn't feel any problem because this was a knockoff product. If it was the original I wouldn't
[06:00.140 --> 06:05.100]  have said the strain name and I'm using the strain names because he talks about these strains so much
[06:05.100 --> 06:09.900]  in the story here that if I tried to alternate and replace it it would confuse all of us. So I had to
[06:09.900 --> 06:14.060]  keep the names the same just to make this make sense. I feel like I did just did one of those
[06:14.060 --> 06:17.580]  names have been changed to protect the innocent sort of speeches. Oh by the way shout out to
[06:17.580 --> 06:22.460]  Dabbs I'm stoned as fucking rambly. Here we go this message goes on it says I got some knockoff
[06:22.460 --> 06:29.180]  genetics of GDP and runs. The GDP hermed early and I caught it. Well that's always unfortunate but I'm
[06:29.180 --> 06:34.380]  glad you caught it. It does say I took it out cut the pollen sacks and sprayed the plant and the rest
[06:34.380 --> 06:39.740]  of the tent down with water. I happened to keep a smaller tent that I had and quarantined it and
[06:39.740 --> 06:44.620]  then about two and a half weeks later the ruts hermed. All right so I at one point let's see
[06:44.620 --> 06:51.420]  star stroke what point hermed early it doesn't say exactly when it says hermed early. If it hermed
[06:51.420 --> 06:56.140]  early it got further in your tent than it would have in mine. Something that herms early something
[06:56.140 --> 07:01.820]  that shows obvious signs of intersex does not last long in my garden. If it shows me herm
[07:01.820 --> 07:05.900]  bye-bye I don't need that there are plenty of seeds plenty of plants I don't need a headache.
[07:05.900 --> 07:10.860]  This is like the dating pool this person already told me we are not compatible. Bye why spend
[07:10.860 --> 07:15.980]  another date with it why spend another week with it in your case why spend more lights air water
[07:15.980 --> 07:21.180]  soil electricity nutrients time energy why waste all that shit on a problematic plant. So it got
[07:21.180 --> 07:25.580]  further in your grow than it would have in mine if it shows intersex that early unless it is
[07:25.580 --> 07:30.060]  something magical that I've been really trying to get I'm not even going to fuck with it and still
[07:30.060 --> 07:33.900]  I would really consider getting rid of it. So it got further in your spot than it did mine
[07:33.900 --> 07:39.260]  it goes on though it says about two and a half weeks later the ruts hermed. It was a short and
[07:39.260 --> 07:43.660]  stocky plant that grows a tight pattern so I made a point for a couple of weeks after the first
[07:43.660 --> 07:49.020]  intersex plant to check the others very close including the ruts. After a few weeks I thought
[07:49.020 --> 07:53.260]  I was safe but when taking them out for the first time in a week I found what looks to be
[07:54.060 --> 07:59.180]  freshly popped male flowers. All right so our friend had a GDP plant he noticed that that was
[07:59.180 --> 08:03.340]  showing intersex signs he took that plant put it into another tent because he happened to have
[08:03.340 --> 08:08.060]  another tent where he could quarantine things good move there if you really insist on keeping that.
[08:08.060 --> 08:11.500]  Now two and a half weeks later we have discovered that the other plant in the room which is a
[08:11.500 --> 08:18.060]  runt plant is showing male flowers. So it goes on to say I repeated what I did before but I don't
[08:18.060 --> 08:23.100]  have another tent or another light and the idea of running three tents isn't something I could do and
[08:23.100 --> 08:28.940]  I know I should call the runts and or the GDP but honestly I believe where am I I caught my I believe
[08:28.940 --> 08:34.300]  I caught the GDP in time but I never stopped checking it and I haven't had issues with it
[08:34.300 --> 08:39.740]  repeating. All right so if you think you got the GDP on time it might not throw out new nanners
[08:39.740 --> 08:45.340]  new male flowers but it could the runts you said you saw full-on male flowers and two and a half
[08:45.340 --> 08:49.020]  weeks in that's probably going to be about three weeks because it was two and a half weeks later
[08:49.020 --> 08:55.020]  could be four weeks honestly you are you have much more leeway in your garden than I do of
[08:55.020 --> 09:00.060]  course I have access to many more seeds many more clones I've got a lot more backup plans but
[09:00.060 --> 09:05.500]  these plants showing me intersex traits at this point of the cycle they would be gone they wouldn't
[09:05.500 --> 09:10.300]  even make it this far in my grow this question wouldn't even be asked it's a intersex intersex
[09:10.300 --> 09:15.180]  snip snip bye bye they'd be out of there because there are so many other seeds and clones that
[09:15.180 --> 09:18.620]  aren't going to give you a headache you're already getting a headache from it I wouldn't I
[09:18.620 --> 09:21.980]  wouldn't fuck with it so I know that further on the question you ask me what to do and we will
[09:21.980 --> 09:27.020]  answer that my overall answer is going to be continue them because it's so far in but don't
[09:27.020 --> 09:31.020]  ever grow these again bro call them chop them why are you wasting your time with these you know that
[09:31.020 --> 09:34.540]  they're crazy don't fuck with them ever again you know that they're problematic don't waste time
[09:34.540 --> 09:39.980]  space energy growing should be delightful is the overall word growing should be great you should
[09:39.980 --> 09:44.220]  feel good about the entire process this is a headache so you're getting a headache and fucking
[09:44.220 --> 09:49.100]  get rid of that like any anything that gives me that much of a headache in my grow by felicia let
[09:49.100 --> 09:53.900]  me find out where we are here in this message because I've got the ADD and I can't find my
[09:53.900 --> 09:58.620]  spot but I'm going to keep talking until we find it it says I've also read and heard that sometimes
[09:58.620 --> 10:05.020]  certain cultivars will throw impotent male flowers and will not pollinate yes a lot of times a plant
[10:05.020 --> 10:09.100]  will throw a non uh what's the word you used impotent I don't know if that's the right word
[10:09.100 --> 10:13.260]  but I'm going to go with it it seems to work uh they will throw flowers that do not contain any
[10:13.260 --> 10:19.580]  pollen sterile is the word I would have used um that looks more like just a skinny dried up banana
[10:19.580 --> 10:23.660]  it looks like a dried up flower that wouldn't do anything if you're getting full-on male flowers
[10:23.660 --> 10:27.740]  that are opening it's a good chance there's pollen in there a good chance I didn't say for sure
[10:28.300 --> 10:33.020]  but many times yes some of these plants can't throw out male flowers that are non-viable uh
[10:33.020 --> 10:37.100]  that are sterile that are non-potent I guess impotent is might be the correct word I'm going
[10:37.100 --> 10:41.660]  to say non-potent because impotent makes me think it can't get its pee pee hard um I'm going to keep
[10:41.660 --> 10:45.740]  going with this it says how would you deal with this issue that's a really good question honestly
[10:45.740 --> 10:49.660]  I said it before these plants wouldn't make it this far as soon as I saw these problems choppity
[10:49.660 --> 10:55.420]  chop chop chop these plants would be gone but I have access to more plants and more what may be
[10:55.420 --> 11:00.300]  more important is I have access to more medicine you may be relying on these plants for medicine
[11:00.300 --> 11:03.660]  which let me get off on a side tangent here I'm going to put my finger here so I know where the
[11:03.660 --> 11:08.540]  fuck I am so that we can get back to this there we go um side tangent I would never have let these
[11:08.540 --> 11:12.540]  plants get this big they would have been little tiny plants I would have tested them out to
[11:12.540 --> 11:16.940]  determine if they have intersex traits or if they're problematic before I grew them this far
[11:16.940 --> 11:21.580]  in my last run when I was growing bigger plants these would have been in the side in the corner
[11:21.580 --> 11:25.660]  little tiny plants showing me if they were worth a shit or not so that I could test run them and
[11:25.660 --> 11:30.220]  then we grow them in big pots I'm not uh what's I'm not talking down on you because you didn't do
[11:30.220 --> 11:33.980]  a test run but that's a way to prevent it next time that would have helped you out especially
[11:33.980 --> 11:38.220]  since you've got two tents you could be doing test runs in that second tent and full-on production
[11:38.220 --> 11:43.340]  runs in the big tent find keepers that way um you skipped a step is what I think I'm trying to say
[11:43.340 --> 11:47.340]  there was a pheno hunt step skipped in here these plants should have been auditioned you got them on
[11:47.340 --> 11:51.420]  the big stage they never played open mic night you got to give them an open mic night before you put
[11:51.420 --> 11:55.580]  them on the big stage in my opinion all right let me get myself back on track here I did save my
[11:55.580 --> 12:00.940]  space with my finger it says should I put the runs in with the GDP yes that's I immediately would
[12:00.940 --> 12:05.020]  have done that I didn't realize you did not do that already as soon as I saw intersex on the
[12:05.020 --> 12:08.620]  other plant it would have gone over to the intersex hotel whichever you want to call that
[12:08.620 --> 12:13.420]  spot I would have gone over there uh to let it finish yeah if you insist on finishing those
[12:13.420 --> 12:19.180]  definitely put them both over there in the freak show hotel um and then leave the non-intersex
[12:19.180 --> 12:23.820]  plant in the other room and see what's happening it goes on to say uh the reason I'm trying to
[12:23.820 --> 12:28.700]  save it is because I'm in prohibition land and it is hard to come by my state just now started
[12:28.700 --> 12:34.860]  rolling out medical but dispensaries are a bit off still without the uh still without okay are
[12:34.860 --> 12:38.860]  still a bit off there should be a comma or a period there but not a big deal without these
[12:38.860 --> 12:44.060]  means no meds and I will make my own edibles so I know I can use them that way if it comes down to
[12:44.060 --> 12:48.700]  having been pollinated that is a that's kind of what I was thinking if these plants are pollinated
[12:48.700 --> 12:52.860]  and have seeds it's better to have something with seeds in it than to have no medicine you did state
[12:52.860 --> 12:57.980]  that the dispensaries aren't quite ready for you yet oftentimes in a new uh place the dispensaries
[12:57.980 --> 13:02.220]  are so expensive that it's not even accessible to patients they say it's a medical program but
[13:02.220 --> 13:05.820]  then they charge you five hundred dollars for an ounce and how is a sick person gonna have a five
[13:05.820 --> 13:10.220]  hundred dollar extra fucking chunk of money laying around to pay for some medicine I get it dude I
[13:10.220 --> 13:14.780]  really do get it I used to be there that's part of what started that's probably part of what starts
[13:14.780 --> 13:19.740]  so many people growing this stuff is so expensive and it's questionable you pay for a product you
[13:19.740 --> 13:23.180]  get it home and you smoke it you're like this doesn't taste right or this tastes like pesticides
[13:23.180 --> 13:27.740]  or this burns like shit uh if you grow it learn about it you got so much more passion and so much
[13:27.740 --> 13:32.620]  more quality I do get it that's why we get going that's why I got going in this dissatisfied with
[13:32.620 --> 13:38.460]  other products um if it is seeded you can smoke it if it does have seeds in it it is smokable
[13:38.460 --> 13:44.140]  some people um I am a seed breeder I make seeded plants I make a lot of seeded plants a lot of my
[13:44.140 --> 13:48.060]  shit's got seeds in it sometimes we'll just cut off a couple of nuggets and we'll smoke we'll dry
[13:48.060 --> 13:52.060]  and cure them and we'll smoke them just to see what the buds like I've made a lot of concentrates
[13:52.060 --> 13:57.660]  out of seeded material we pull the seeds out run the material there's a different buzz that happens
[13:57.740 --> 14:01.980]  from seeded material there's a different cannabinoid a different terpene a different I
[14:01.980 --> 14:06.380]  don't know what it is but it's something in that plant that you can only get from a plant that has
[14:06.380 --> 14:11.820]  been seeded it's a totally different buzz it is heavier and the stony department like your body
[14:11.820 --> 14:17.580]  feels it but also it's more psychedelic and for me to say psychedelic that takes a lot in cannabis
[14:17.580 --> 14:24.060]  because I have uh more than delved in the world of psychedelia I know what real psychedelics are
[14:24.060 --> 14:28.620]  and for me to say that weed can be psychedelic that takes something so that seeded weed can
[14:28.620 --> 14:33.820]  almost bring on like a trippy vision head change sort of a thing so even if there are seeds in
[14:33.820 --> 14:39.020]  there you can dry it and cure it and smoke it if you choose to do that but making edibles making
[14:39.020 --> 14:43.900]  tinctures making whatever is great also so get those seeds out of there uh separate those seeds
[14:43.900 --> 14:47.500]  I would recommend probably just tossing those seeds some people will say they're viable you're
[14:47.500 --> 14:51.100]  already dealing with an intersex issue you don't want more headaches in my opinion those are
[14:51.100 --> 14:55.420]  headache seeds those are bird seed I would get rid of them a lot of people out there are raising
[14:55.420 --> 14:59.740]  their fist in the air saying those are good seeds I think intersex begets intersex I would toss them
[14:59.740 --> 15:03.420]  so you don't have to deal with this again in the future get that material make the products you
[15:03.420 --> 15:08.380]  want to make that will work let me catch up because there is more to this message it says I
[15:08.380 --> 15:12.620]  know I can still use them that way if it comes down to having been pollinated yes they are still
[15:12.620 --> 15:17.820]  viable plants if you want to let them finish uh they are intersex they are possibly pollinating
[15:17.820 --> 15:22.860]  the other plant that you've got in that other room they may already have pollinated that but
[15:22.860 --> 15:27.180]  if you insist on finishing them they will be usable however don't grow this again if you've
[15:27.180 --> 15:32.700]  got clones of that star struck grow that if you've got other seeds grow those do a proper pheno hunt
[15:32.700 --> 15:38.060]  so that you can eliminate this kind of problem in the next run grow some plants grow your legal limit
[15:38.060 --> 15:43.020]  grow them small don't grow them very big veg them for a small time get a clone from them
[15:43.020 --> 15:47.900]  then flower them if you see any problems get the fuck rid of it when you see keepers keep those and
[15:47.900 --> 15:52.700]  keep that clone forever create a mother plant I think I've done podcasts on pheno hunting
[15:52.700 --> 15:58.060]  selection and mother plants so those should help you out I do need to find my space again it says
[15:58.060 --> 16:03.660]  also the main reason I messaged at all is to ask you if you can tell if a plant is actually seeded
[16:03.660 --> 16:09.260]  or not or do you literally have to tear open a bud to know for sure you don't have to tear open a
[16:09.260 --> 16:15.100]  giant bud and find one little tiny nugget somewhere on that plant is a little just a little
[16:15.100 --> 16:20.540]  shitty popcorn nugget that you can spare just pinch it just squeeze it seeds by now if it's been a
[16:20.540 --> 16:24.780]  couple of weeks seeds are starting to get hard they don't feel like normal weed normal buds
[16:24.780 --> 16:28.940]  feels I almost said smells they don't feel like normal bud would feel normally the bud would be
[16:28.940 --> 16:34.300]  squishy maybe spongy right now there's a hard piece in there that is your seed if you squeeze a calyx
[16:34.300 --> 16:39.020]  if you squeeze a bract you may feel there's a seed in there you could take off a little nug from the
[16:39.020 --> 16:43.180]  bottom you could take off just one tiny nug you're not going to ruin the whole crop tear it open give
[16:43.180 --> 16:47.580]  it a squeeze give it an investigation you may see little white starts of seeds you may see fully
[16:47.580 --> 16:52.940]  developed seeds you may have fully ripened hardened seeds in there if so you've got seeds to deal with
[16:52.940 --> 16:56.940]  and you've got a good learning experience but you don't have to destroy the whole plant just to find
[16:56.940 --> 17:01.180]  out if there's a seed in there as a breeder when it comes close when I've pollinated a plant I know
[17:01.180 --> 17:06.620]  it's almost time to cut it down I'll take fingers and just grab a bud just grab a nug and pull you
[17:06.620 --> 17:10.300]  can pull off a couple of bracts and they'll come right off the plant and you can just roll it around
[17:10.300 --> 17:13.660]  in your fingers and all the material will come off and you'll have seeds in your hand if there's
[17:13.660 --> 17:20.140]  seeds there you'll definitely be able to tell hopefully if it was just a small intersex section
[17:20.140 --> 17:25.500]  of your plant that showed intersex and pollinated hopefully it didn't put out a bunch of pollen
[17:25.500 --> 17:29.580]  maybe just just some sprinkles and you only got a few seeds here and there it sounds like you caught
[17:29.580 --> 17:34.300]  it early you started being proactive or at least reactive to what you found maybe you didn't get a
[17:34.300 --> 17:38.540]  lot of seeds in there it wasn't in there for very long maybe it was non-viable what's the word we
[17:38.540 --> 17:42.940]  used maybe it was impotent like you said before maybe it didn't make any seeds right now it's
[17:42.940 --> 17:48.140]  kind of just a wait and see game or go in there and give it a squeeze and see but um there could
[17:48.140 --> 17:55.100]  be depending on which part of the plant was facing the plant that uh uh intersects maybe those two
[17:55.100 --> 17:59.100]  buds that were touching maybe some pollination happened there but up top nothing happened
[17:59.100 --> 18:03.180]  I noticed that in the greenhouse this summer the plants that were right around the male plant
[18:03.180 --> 18:07.180]  that perimeter was loaded with seeds you could walk by the plant and brush it and seeds would
[18:07.180 --> 18:11.100]  fall out but as you got further from that male and circumference in the greenhouse there were
[18:11.100 --> 18:16.540]  less and less seeds so depending on the how far that male was shooting his pollen you may not have
[18:16.540 --> 18:21.500]  a lot of seeds or that whole plant could be busted up it's hard to hard to guess uh but I'm wishing
[18:21.500 --> 18:26.780]  for the best for you to tell you the truth now it says um thanks for the awesome podcast and all the
[18:26.780 --> 18:31.260]  knowledge you share with the army and myself you are very welcome thank you thank you for the great
[18:31.500 --> 18:37.500]  patreon question and also the patreon support I do appreciate that it says I hope you never stop I do
[18:37.500 --> 18:43.100]  not have a reason to stop at this point can't stop won't stop you guys feel my fire every day every
[18:43.100 --> 18:47.180]  day I wake up my inbox is filled with more great questions and I feel like it is kind of my
[18:47.180 --> 18:51.580]  responsibility at this point to field those questions I've been given this gift of gab I've
[18:51.580 --> 18:56.540]  been given this gift to understand the plants in a way I don't try to act like I'm some major college
[18:56.540 --> 19:00.540]  professor when it comes to growing and cannabis I know the plants because I've grown them touched
[19:00.540 --> 19:04.780]  them been in the grow rooms I've got a lot of experience and I feel if I didn't share that
[19:04.780 --> 19:08.940]  between the gift of gab and the the experience with the plants something would go wrong this is
[19:08.940 --> 19:14.140]  my duty whatever you believe in I believe that that inspires me to teach you how to be a good
[19:14.140 --> 19:18.380]  cannabis grower without me doing that I think that uh I might spontaneously combust or something I
[19:18.380 --> 19:23.580]  would not be doing my duty as a person so that's my job supposed to be here teaching people how to
[19:23.580 --> 19:26.940]  grow I'm also supposed to be a good dad and be a good drummer and there are a few other things I
[19:26.940 --> 19:30.940]  think I'm supposed to do so thank you for the huge compliments bro I do appreciate that thank
[19:30.940 --> 19:35.580]  you for the encouragement I never will stop and he wraps it up by saying you've helped my game go
[19:35.580 --> 19:40.940]  up so far that it nearly matches my high from my last crop of orange gasm that's good you must be
[19:40.940 --> 19:45.500]  super high from that orange gasm I hope I keep stepping up your crop because that is my goal
[19:45.500 --> 19:50.380]  to improve everybody's crop to set everybody up for success that's harder to say than it sounds
[19:50.380 --> 19:54.220]  trying to get everybody out there growing on a professional level so that people don't have to
[19:54.220 --> 20:00.140]  rely on dispensaries and uh free market growers if that's where you're getting your product that's
[20:00.140 --> 20:04.300]  great but wouldn't it be awesome if you could just grow it yourself not have to meet some random
[20:04.300 --> 20:08.540]  person in a parking lot at a random place at 5 30 and they don't show up till 6 and the product
[20:08.540 --> 20:12.540]  they have isn't what you were hoping for if we could all produce our own products we would all
[20:12.540 --> 20:17.980]  be self-sufficient the world would be great also we can all overgrow the government one grow at a
[20:17.980 --> 20:23.340]  time one seed at a time one harvest at a time that is the goal all right ladies and gentlemen boys
[20:23.340 --> 20:28.860]  girls pimps hoes friends folks smokers growers clone cutters pollen chuckers all of you beautiful
[20:28.860 --> 20:32.300]  cannabis enthusiasts out there I want to thank you once again for listening to another episode
[20:32.300 --> 20:36.700]  of the grow from your heart podcast I know the past couple of episodes have been short but it
[20:36.700 --> 20:41.100]  seems to work I'm getting a lot of clicks and a lot of views we're popping up in the algorithm
[20:41.100 --> 20:46.300]  more frequently uh the quicker episodes seem to work for the people with the ADD the people that
[20:46.300 --> 20:50.780]  want longer shows I put out two a week I guess listen to those or go listen to one of our
