[00:00.000 --> 00:05.560]  All right. Welcome back podcast world. It is time for episode 530 of the grow from your
[00:05.560 --> 00:10.720]  heart podcast. Joining me via zoom for his first time on video is white Mike. Welcome
[00:10.720 --> 00:15.000]  to the show, bro. What's up, man? What's up, everybody? Dude, thank you for joining me.
[00:15.000 --> 00:20.000]  You look good. You sound good. This is going to be a really good time. Brave new world,
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.640]  folks. Brave new world. Some positive shit did come out of the quarantine. If we wouldn't
[00:25.640 --> 00:28.320]  again, if we would not have gotten locked down, I don't think we ever would have ended
[00:28.320 --> 00:35.920]  up doing this. GFYH on video podcast brought to you by Corona. Whoa. Uh, the virus, the
[00:35.920 --> 00:39.680]  virus, not the beer. Yeah. I was going to say clear that up. The beer is still a thing.
[00:39.680 --> 00:43.320]  Uh, man, I feel sorry for the beer company. We should do, I don't drink, but I feel like
[00:43.320 --> 00:48.160]  I should just buy a bunch of Corona just because yeah. Uh, start drinking because of the fucking
[00:48.160 --> 00:52.040]  virus would be like a way to deal with that. No, don't do that guys. That's not a good
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.800]  thing. Down temporarily for all of this. And that's just sad. Uh, is it because they don't
[00:57.800 --> 01:00.880]  have people to make the beer, they got to send the people home or is it just nobody's
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.120]  buying the damn beer? Does sales plummeted? Yeah, that's too bad. January because people
[01:06.120 --> 01:09.720]  are dumb. It's just like the toilet paper thing. There's no fucking rhyme or reason
[01:09.720 --> 01:13.720]  to it. It's just people heard Corona virus and they were like, Oh fuck dude, switched
[01:13.720 --> 01:19.080]  to Modelo herd mentality, sheep logic. I get it. Bro. Thank you for joining me on zoom.
[01:19.080 --> 01:22.360]  This is awesome. Having a good time. You look good. You sound great. Thank you for being

[02:04.120 --> 02:09.900]  dudes coughing, uh, I am dabbing some stuff called first matter premium concentrates.
[02:09.900 --> 02:10.900]  This is new to me.
[02:10.900 --> 02:15.960]  Oh, the viewer to be viewers today and get to see what we're dabbing. Yes. Yes. This
[02:15.960 --> 02:18.840]  is a good time. It's the first time they'll actually get a view of what we're dabbing
[02:18.840 --> 02:23.120]  on. If my sweaty hands can get this childproof container open, it's making that skippy sound
[02:23.120 --> 02:27.060]  where it's hard to open. There we go. Uh, this is first matter premium concentrates.
[02:27.060 --> 02:31.640]  This is a new company. Uh, it says contains marijuana, keep away from children on the
[02:31.640 --> 02:40.200]  back of the package. It says, uh, this product contains 94.4% THC. A, um, it's one gram of
[02:40.200 --> 02:45.440]  alchemy crystals. Uh, I was gifted this by a friend, uh, via another friend, shout out
[02:45.440 --> 02:50.200]  to friends, passing things along for friends. When you crack open this jar, this was a one
[02:50.200 --> 02:55.440]  gram fat diamond. I'm going to put it on a dabber and show the camera. Yeah. This company
[02:55.440 --> 03:01.160]  specializes in just straight up rocks. THC, a diamonds. If you're watching this on the
[03:01.160 --> 03:06.040]  camera, on the video, that is real. That is a THC, a diamond. I've already dabbed about
[03:06.040 --> 03:11.200]  half of this. This is half of what was left in the half of what was in the container.
[03:11.200 --> 03:14.640]  It was a gift and it was specially selected for me. So it may have been bigger than a
[03:14.840 --> 03:21.600]  gram, but that was a very beautiful diamond. It is odorless and it is flavorless, but it
[03:21.600 --> 03:26.600]  is very potent when you dab it. Uh, it makes your arm, my arm hair stand up. It made me
[03:26.600 --> 03:32.620]  get real talkative. I got red. My body temperature went up. I took a fucking big dab also. Uh,
[03:32.620 --> 03:37.680]  it was, I really liked it. Then the person who gave it to me recommended, she's like,
[03:37.680 --> 03:41.000]  I know you, you probably have some Terp sauce or something. I really like it when you mix
[03:41.000 --> 03:44.680]  it with a little bit of Terp sauce. Of course, you know me, I've got some Terp sauce. I've
[03:44.680 --> 03:50.060]  got this little 10 gram jar of lemon OG Terp sauce from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[03:50.060 --> 03:55.240]  So I put a little chunk of that concentrate on the, uh, just on the table and then I dipped
[03:55.240 --> 03:58.800]  it into a little bit of this Terp sauce. Try to get that on the camera there a little bit.
[03:58.800 --> 04:03.080]  That's just liquid terpenes in there. Lord cannabis derived terpenes. Yeah, that is a
[04:03.080 --> 04:07.560]  high terpene full spectrum extract. That's probably seven or eight grams left in that
[04:07.560 --> 04:12.360]  jar there. Uh, but we put some of that on it and that was tremendous. The high goes
[04:12.360 --> 04:17.120]  straight to the face, just kapow instantly. As soon as you dab it, you're like, Oh, whoa,
[04:17.120 --> 04:23.280]  I might be in trouble. And you get, I got real high from it. Um, kind of almost too
[04:23.280 --> 04:27.240]  talkative, almost racy, almost a paranoid sort of a thing for a minute. But once it
[04:27.240 --> 04:32.000]  settles in, I was loving it. I was super high, like psychedelic high, like let's go do some
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.120]  shit. Uh, good concert, kind of a buzz. Uh, unfortunately we're just hanging out here
[04:36.120 --> 04:39.960]  at the house. So, uh, but it was a great buzz. So shout out to our new friends from
[04:39.960 --> 04:43.360]  first matter premium concentrates. They didn't pay to be on the show. They didn't ask for
[04:43.360 --> 04:46.680]  anything like that. Uh, they threw me a gram of concentrates and I fucking approve. And
[04:46.680 --> 04:50.840]  that's a really good way to get yourself on the show. Uh, I just have to like your product.
[04:50.840 --> 04:53.320]  That's really the way to do it. If I don't like your product, I won't put you on the
[04:53.320 --> 04:57.560]  show because why would I share it with my friends? Uh, Mike, I feel like I've been talking
[04:57.560 --> 05:00.820]  a long time about what I've been smoking on. Would you like to share with us what you're
[05:00.820 --> 05:04.240]  smoking today? Sure. Most of what I've been smoking today
[05:04.240 --> 05:12.560]  is the sour diesel Ambrosia. Nice. I get that out there. Is that coming through folks?
[05:12.560 --> 05:15.560]  There's not a lot of light down here. It's kind of coming through on the video show.
[05:15.560 --> 05:20.840]  That looks pretty good to me. I would dab that. It's wonderful. Nice diamonds, delicious
[05:20.840 --> 05:26.240]  sauce. It's it's doing his damn job. I'll tell you that much. I was going to say you
[05:26.240 --> 05:32.840]  sound stoned. Not a lot of details and just basic hash worked. Yeah. All right. Well,
[05:32.840 --> 05:37.640]  Mike is smoking sour diesel Ambrosia from our friends at Apothecary Farms. Um, not to
[05:37.640 --> 05:42.120]  be a hater of your concentrate. I'm not a fan of sour diesel concentrates, but I love
[05:42.120 --> 05:47.560]  the sour diesel flowers. Something about extracting it doesn't bring that proper essence. In my
[05:47.560 --> 05:54.240]  opinion, it loses something for sure. But, uh, I was missing the sour D and that's what
[05:54.240 --> 05:59.440]  was available. The buzz is still there. So if you want that sour D high, that the buzz,
[05:59.440 --> 06:03.080]  the high, the medicine, the medication, whatever the effect you're going to get that. But I
[06:03.080 --> 06:06.920]  don't, I think it just something about the sour D I want that. You can smell it through
[06:06.920 --> 06:11.800]  the bag in my pocket. Like who's got that diesel. Like that's the kind of diesel that
[06:11.800 --> 06:15.560]  I love. And I missed that. When you smoke it, everybody for four miles looks towards
[06:15.560 --> 06:19.760]  you going, damn, your weed smells good. We were spoiled here for a lot of years with
[06:19.760 --> 06:23.800]  good diesel everywhere. Uh, I had a couple of friends who grew that diesel shout out
[06:23.800 --> 06:28.320]  to those guys for doing a really good job. Uh, one of them listens to the show. So, uh,
[06:28.320 --> 06:33.480]  big ups dude. I hope you're doing well. Yeah. We sure do man. Grow somewhere that sour
[06:33.480 --> 06:38.560]  D I'll take a little bit of it. My legal limit. That's what I'll take. Um, Mike, this is the
[06:38.560 --> 06:42.760]  portion of the show where we do shout outs to our friends who support the show on Patreon.
[06:42.760 --> 06:47.120]  I was rolling up digital joints and passing up digital bong loads that seemed to suck
[06:47.120 --> 06:51.880]  up a lot of time. And I also got really tongue tied during all of that shit. So all of my
[06:51.880 --> 06:56.520]  friends from Patreon, you all get a dab, a bong rip and edible and a pre-roll to take
[06:56.520 --> 07:00.760]  home. So let's send them all a shout out. Let's start off with giant Mike and the dabbing
[07:00.760 --> 07:04.960]  queen. Let's send a big shout out to Helly. I got a big giant shout out to my friend E
[07:04.960 --> 07:10.840]  two Oh five, seven. Um, no, it's easy. Oh five, seven. Sorry. I can't read my own damn
[07:10.840 --> 07:15.400]  handwriting. I know what Oh five, seven means bro. That's fucking rad. A big shout out to,
[07:15.400 --> 07:20.240]  are you lighting up Tim? Big shout out to our friend Kurt Z. I always got a big pinchy
[07:20.240 --> 07:23.800]  shout out to my buddy, lobster Bush. Let's send a big thank you. Shout out to my friend,

[08:19.120 --> 08:23.720]  the show several times. He brings a lot of great knowledge and information several times.
[08:23.720 --> 08:27.360]  Yeah. He's, I think he's been on a hundred episodes. We were talking earlier. Yeah. I'm
[08:27.360 --> 08:31.480]  going to guess easily. You're on a quarter of the shows for a while. You run a long stretch.
[08:31.480 --> 08:36.160]  I'm going to say you've been on a hundred shows. Mike is very articulate. He's well
[08:36.160 --> 08:41.040]  spoken. He's got really good opinions. I respect his thoughts and opinions. His thought process.
[08:41.040 --> 08:46.100]  Most of what he says really makes sense to me. It's okay that I disagree with you occasionally.
[08:46.100 --> 08:50.500]  That's why we're good friends, but most of the time he's spot on. So that's my ad for

[09:03.140 --> 09:07.220]  Mike. So patreon.com forward slash white Mike, bro, I'm proud of you for getting the video
[09:07.220 --> 09:10.940]  show going and a Patreon campaign. Welcome to 2020.
[09:11.580 --> 09:12.980]  Yeah. 2020 is here, baby.
[09:12.980 --> 09:17.660]  You've been in 2015 for a minute. So I'm proud of you for making it this far.
[09:17.660 --> 09:21.900]  Yeah. We've been on lockdown for a minute. I had to get inventive and a Patreon and some
[09:21.900 --> 09:25.860]  video episodes. I think it's going to be no way to do it for a minute.
[09:25.860 --> 09:29.500]  I think it'll be great. And it's a good way to make a positive out of a negative, but
[09:29.500 --> 09:33.860]  people need some entertainment. They want to get their mind off of things and seeing
[09:33.860 --> 09:37.380]  our smiley or whatever you want to call it. Our pasty faces here on the screen is a good
[09:37.380 --> 09:42.140]  way for people to escape and also learn something. They're hanging out with us. We can pass them
[09:42.140 --> 09:46.420]  a virtual fucking joint like this. They could grab it through the screen. There you go.
[09:46.420 --> 09:50.420]  And then they can hang out and they can learn. They can get edumacated and it's fucking free.
[09:50.420 --> 09:51.420]  So that is really cool.
[09:51.420 --> 09:57.380]  Yeah. I'm missing the flowers, man. I need flowers down in my bunker, but I've been keeping
[09:57.380 --> 09:59.500]  the flowers outside at this new place.
[09:59.500 --> 10:01.300]  Oh man, that's new.
[10:01.300 --> 10:03.140]  Hash only in the bunker.
[10:03.140 --> 10:04.140]  How was that going to play?
[10:04.140 --> 10:05.700]  It's a side effect of the no smoking.
[10:06.300 --> 10:12.260]  Oh, okay. All right. I'm this. I don't know if this is anybody else's getting this, but
[10:12.260 --> 10:17.380]  I am very confused by the seasons and the time of year right now. I keep forgetting
[10:17.380 --> 10:21.620]  that it is spring and going into summer. I keep feeling like we just got fucked for summer
[10:21.620 --> 10:26.460]  and we're going into winter. I've been shopping online and most of my clothes are fall and
[10:26.460 --> 10:28.020]  winter appropriate that I've purchased.
[10:28.020 --> 10:30.980]  Did you dab yourself all the way to the end of the year already, bro?
[10:30.980 --> 10:35.100]  No, something about the lockdown. I just, I'm like, well, we got fucked for spring.
[10:35.100 --> 10:39.060]  I didn't see the spring happen like I normally do. And it was cold. And so I guess I'm used
[10:39.060 --> 10:42.060]  to it just being cold. And I thought it was going to continue to be cold or something.
[10:42.060 --> 10:43.340]  I don't know. My brain was.
[10:43.340 --> 10:46.900]  You went inside when it was cold out and your body hasn't told you it's summer yet.
[10:46.900 --> 10:51.860]  Yeah. We haven't had that. It was like 420, bro. We should have had a 420 party. We should
[10:51.860 --> 10:54.500]  have had an Easter party. We should have had a St. Patrick's day party. There should have
[10:54.500 --> 10:58.460]  been so many things to tell my mind and body that we've progressed in the year. Instead,
[10:58.460 --> 11:02.500]  it's been groundhog day. I'm just doing the same fucking Tuesday every day, dude. Every
[11:02.500 --> 11:03.500]  day is Tuesday.
[11:03.900 --> 11:09.900]  I don't know about you listeners, but the groundhog day thing, that's fucking legit
[11:09.900 --> 11:13.900]  during the lockdown. It is weird. Every day, the same.
[11:13.900 --> 11:18.540]  Hopefully people are listening to this. What would be the future from now? So I don't try
[11:18.540 --> 11:23.540]  to dwell too much on the COVID-19 thing, but just an update. We are recording late night
[11:23.540 --> 11:30.980]  on April 27th, 2020. We're currently how many weeks, dude? Six weeks in the morning on the
[11:30.980 --> 11:37.340]  27th. Yeah. Yeah. Were we six weeks into the quarantine COVID-19 situation now? March
[11:37.340 --> 11:43.740]  26th is we're a month. Okay. It's been a month since Colorado started the real estate homeowner.
[11:43.740 --> 11:48.060]  And it has been, I haven't really, I've left and I've gone a few places. I haven't gone
[11:48.060 --> 11:55.660]  anywhere to go enjoy and be somewhere since March 12th. The 12th of March was the last
[11:55.660 --> 11:58.820]  time I've really gone out. I've seen a few people because there are a few things that
[11:58.820 --> 12:02.980]  were almost necessary interactions, like things that just have to happen. I've gone
[12:02.980 --> 12:07.940]  to the grocery store. I've gone to the dispensary. I've seen you once or twice that were brief
[12:07.940 --> 12:13.460]  interactions, but I know we don't talk too much about that, but that had to happen. You
[12:13.460 --> 12:16.380]  had to get equipment. How were you going to record if you didn't get equipment from me?
[12:16.380 --> 12:19.300]  So I had to teach you that real quick. It would be silly to mail me equipment that was
[12:19.300 --> 12:23.860]  already mailed to you. Yeah. And then there was no way to teach you. It was like, I have
[12:23.860 --> 12:29.060]  to see him to teach him this. So there was one equipment lesson, but it's been kind of
[12:29.060 --> 12:33.780]  strange. I'm adapting well. Like I've talked about previous times, I'm a grower. I'm kind
[12:33.780 --> 12:38.140]  of a hermit. I'm good at being a hermit. I've been practicing this isolation, the isolation
[12:38.140 --> 12:42.460]  games since I was a teenager, since high school. So this wasn't too bad for me. And Mike, I
[12:42.460 --> 12:45.740]  know you're kind of a gamer and you've got some family at home.
[12:45.740 --> 12:48.660]  And then yeah, the kids at home, that helps.
[12:48.660 --> 12:52.140]  Yeah. You've got entertainment or whatever you want to call it all day long.
[12:52.180 --> 12:57.300]  Yeah. But like a couple of days back, me and my oldest kid, he's four, almost five. We
[12:57.300 --> 13:03.460]  went for a drive for the first time in like three weeks. And we hit the highway.
[13:03.460 --> 13:06.540]  And as soon as we got on the highway, it was like, dad, it feels like we're flying.
[13:06.540 --> 13:08.780]  And it was like we were doing like 35 miles an hour.
[13:08.780 --> 13:11.220]  Just we had just gotten onto the highway.
[13:11.220 --> 13:14.060]  I just hit the gas. He was like, oh, wow.
[13:14.500 --> 13:17.300]  It's like, oh, buddy, we've been at home for too fucking long.
[13:17.300 --> 13:20.500]  There's no traffic. I had to go to the grocery store to get supplies.
[13:20.500 --> 13:22.220]  And there was nobody out.
[13:22.220 --> 13:24.340]  And the guy at the grocery store, he wasn't sleeping.
[13:24.340 --> 13:27.700]  Not to say that the guy at the store wasn't doing his job, but he should have been
[13:27.700 --> 13:30.620]  sleeping. I was the only customer he had seen for all day.
[13:31.260 --> 13:32.940]  Oh, and he wanted to talk.
[13:32.940 --> 13:34.740]  He's like, so what are you going to grow? How many of me going to grow?
[13:34.740 --> 13:36.460]  What? How long are you going to veggie? How long are you going to flower?
[13:36.460 --> 13:38.420]  How long does it take? What does it smell like? What does it look like?
[13:38.420 --> 13:39.700]  What's your name? Yeah, bro.
[13:39.700 --> 13:41.940]  What did you eat? He was like, just talk to me, please.
[13:41.940 --> 13:43.260]  I've been here for all day.
[13:43.260 --> 13:44.700]  Yeah, you can see it on him. Poor guy.
[13:44.700 --> 13:47.380]  But thank you to all the people who are keeping businesses going.
[13:47.380 --> 13:49.060]  I know it's a struggle right now.
[13:49.060 --> 13:50.380]  I could see it on your face, bro.
[13:50.380 --> 13:52.380]  I should have brought him lunch or something. Maybe next time.
[13:54.100 --> 13:56.500]  I love it. Show up with food for the guys.
[13:56.500 --> 13:57.260]  It's always awesome.
[13:58.460 --> 14:00.340]  All right, Mike, we've been rambling for quite some time.
[14:00.340 --> 14:02.780]  I did not really pay attention to how long we've been going.
[14:02.820 --> 14:05.740]  So I think we're about 15, 17 minutes into this.
[14:07.100 --> 14:10.740]  And I'm awesomely excited to have you here on a video show.
[14:11.260 --> 14:15.220]  I think that this would be a good opportunity to kind of do the official white
[14:15.220 --> 14:17.260]  mic interview. You've been around for quite a while.
[14:17.260 --> 14:20.860]  You've been on a hundred episodes. People know kind of who you are.
[14:20.860 --> 14:21.820]  They know what you're about,
[14:21.820 --> 14:24.860]  but they don't know much about you other than what we've talked about on the
[14:24.860 --> 14:26.580]  show. The only, I said earlier,
[14:26.580 --> 14:29.380]  the only real credit you've got is because I've given you street cred.
[14:29.380 --> 14:31.740]  I say you're cool. So they believe me. Like if Ross,
[14:31.740 --> 14:33.380]  the Jeff brought him around, he's got to be all right.
[14:33.380 --> 14:36.300]  He wouldn't bring too much too crazy of a person around, but
[14:36.380 --> 14:40.220]  I've been vetted, but who knows? Yeah, exactly.
[14:40.220 --> 14:43.260]  They know that basically you're like my cohost or one of my best friends or
[14:43.260 --> 14:45.940]  probably my best friend and my sidekick is basically what they know.
[14:45.980 --> 14:49.140]  And that you fucking ramble a lot and that you drink Mountain Dew and you smoke
[14:49.140 --> 14:52.700]  dabs and that you haven't had a cigarette and fucking how many days now, dude?
[14:53.300 --> 14:55.300]  Uh, three months, five days.
[14:55.700 --> 14:57.540]  See, so those are the things that they know about you.
[14:57.820 --> 15:02.020]  I feel like today is a really good opportunity to learn a little bit more and
[15:02.020 --> 15:05.820]  share that shit about my friend, white Mike. So in this episode, guys,
[15:06.140 --> 15:09.580]  we're going to do the official white mic interview. Here we go.
[15:09.580 --> 15:12.420]  White mic interview, volume one. We may do this in the future.
[15:12.900 --> 15:17.180]  I'd like to start it off by talking about how and where I met my buddy, white
[15:17.180 --> 15:18.020]  Mike.
[15:18.140 --> 15:22.500]  I was honored and privileged to be a part of the very first dispensary here in
[15:22.500 --> 15:25.900]  Pueblo, Colorado. It was called Metamar. It was called Metamar ministries.
[15:25.900 --> 15:29.300]  We were kind of flying under a radar by putting the word ministries on there and
[15:29.300 --> 15:31.780]  it worked, but we were Metamar ministries.
[15:31.780 --> 15:35.020]  We were ran by a guy named Tom and his beautiful wife, Karen, rest in peace,
[15:35.020 --> 15:37.620]  Karen. I love you and I miss you. I wish I could pass you a joint right now.
[15:38.100 --> 15:40.460]  There were a couple of other folks involved in that dispensary.
[15:40.580 --> 15:44.060]  We got to mention Chrisanne and tree, several other folks,
[15:44.060 --> 15:47.260]  but I was mainly the dude running the show.
[15:47.260 --> 15:51.700]  I found a dispensary that was kind of operating in an apartment and I was like,
[15:51.700 --> 15:54.180]  how about we open an office and do this for real? And they're like,
[15:54.180 --> 15:57.020]  if you're brave enough to go set up a counter and do this, we'll do it.
[15:57.260 --> 15:58.660]  And I was like, we're doing it kind of sketchy.
[15:58.740 --> 16:00.620]  Let's just fucking do it for real. If we're going to do it,
[16:00.620 --> 16:03.380]  we're going to get in trouble up here or down here. Let's do it.
[16:03.940 --> 16:06.660]  This was in what? 2009?
[16:07.140 --> 16:10.340]  I think 2008 is when we got it going. When I started doing it,
[16:10.660 --> 16:14.020]  winter of 2008 is when I met the guy in the apartment, I believe.
[16:14.380 --> 16:17.820]  Cause I got my medical card around, uh, before Christmas,
[16:17.820 --> 16:21.100]  around Thanksgiving that year. I believe if I've got a brain injury, Mike,
[16:21.100 --> 16:23.340]  so you gotta give me some credit on my timelines.
[16:23.500 --> 16:27.420]  That timeline sounds about right. 2008 ish, 2000, early 2009 ish.
[16:28.140 --> 16:31.140]  So I think winter of 2008 is when I met the guy in the apartment.
[16:31.500 --> 16:33.740]  By early 2009,
[16:33.740 --> 16:37.780]  we had moved it downstairs to the retail place and we'd opened up like a full on
[16:37.820 --> 16:38.940]  retail dispensary.
[16:39.500 --> 16:43.620]  I was working six days a week from open to close in the dispensary.
[16:43.620 --> 16:46.620]  Now I'm not bragging. I'm not complaining. That was my position. It was awesome.
[16:46.860 --> 16:50.180]  No problem with that. I would fucking, that was a great time. I learned so much.
[16:50.180 --> 16:52.380]  I had so much interaction. I got so much.
[16:53.300 --> 16:56.540]  At this time in, at least in Colorado,
[16:56.540 --> 17:00.020]  selling weed over the counter was a little bit like being a space Ranger.
[17:00.300 --> 17:03.580]  It was awesome, dude. I was, people thought I was a superhero.
[17:04.100 --> 17:04.940]  And it was, it was,
[17:05.380 --> 17:08.740]  snacks and food and lunch and stickers and gifts all the time.
[17:08.980 --> 17:12.260]  And also there were restrictions that this was a thing. Yeah. If,
[17:12.540 --> 17:15.260]  if you couldn't decide if you wanted to buy a jar a or jar B,
[17:15.660 --> 17:18.780]  I'd pack up a bowl of jar a and a bowl of jar B and we'd fucking smoke them.
[17:18.860 --> 17:22.220]  See which one you like better than you could make your decision. Like it was real.
[17:22.220 --> 17:23.940]  We'd smoke them right there in the fucking office.
[17:23.940 --> 17:28.100]  So eventually that dispensary got hopping, got super popular.
[17:28.140 --> 17:30.580]  We were banging and I couldn't keep up by myself.
[17:30.980 --> 17:35.260]  And Mike kept coming in with another person. Um,
[17:35.460 --> 17:39.380]  his father-in-law, I'm not sure how much detail I should convey here, but, uh,
[17:39.420 --> 17:41.500]  Mike came in with his father-in-law. I made,
[17:41.620 --> 17:43.980]  I had already known his father-in-law. His father-in-law was a cool,
[17:43.980 --> 17:47.060]  cantankerous old guy. He came in several times without Mike.
[17:47.060 --> 17:50.700]  And then he came in a few times with Mike and Mike and I just made friends.
[17:51.740 --> 17:54.500]  Then one time I will remember this forever. Uh,
[17:54.780 --> 17:57.460]  Mike and his old man came to my house to hang out.
[17:57.700 --> 18:00.540]  We just became smoking buddies and the doorbell rang.
[18:01.060 --> 18:04.820]  And it was the first time that your old man really introduced us. He's like,
[18:04.820 --> 18:08.420]  Jeff, Mike, Mike, Jeff. And I go, and you must be, uh,
[18:08.420 --> 18:12.580]  I said, you must be the seed. And I was calling your old man, the old man,
[18:12.580 --> 18:13.820]  the old man in the seed, the book.
[18:13.860 --> 18:17.780]  And you got my literary reference fucking spot on without hesitation.
[18:17.780 --> 18:21.020]  And you laughed and we were, we, I was like being this guy or friends.
[18:21.020 --> 18:23.700]  I had already liked you from coming into the dispensary. You speak well,
[18:23.700 --> 18:27.260]  you're articulate, you're fucking smart. We're into similar lines of music.
[18:27.260 --> 18:30.060]  We like to argue about the music, but deep down our roots are the fucking same.
[18:30.500 --> 18:34.300]  Uh, right. And we're just like the herb. We both love ganja. Yeah.
[18:34.300 --> 18:38.220]  And we wanted to put ganja in a positive light. So we became friends.
[18:38.780 --> 18:41.380]  I got the opportunity. I was the manager at that dispensary.
[18:41.380 --> 18:45.460]  I got the opportunity by the owner to hire another bud tender and an assistant
[18:45.460 --> 18:49.860]  manager. Mike was honestly the first person to come to my mind. He's well-spoken.
[18:49.860 --> 18:53.460]  He's a smart guy. I trust him. He knew about cannabis. So I was like,
[18:53.500 --> 18:56.300]  I know this guy, Mike, let's fucking give him a shot. They interviewed him.
[18:56.300 --> 19:00.380]  I think they probably hired you on the spot knowing Tom. Yeah. Yeah.
[19:00.700 --> 19:05.180]  So it was one of the stranger days. My, I was like, do you want to work here?
[19:05.180 --> 19:07.420]  And I was like, yeah, tell me a little bit about yourself.
[19:07.420 --> 19:11.940]  I gave him like a little five minute. Here's what's up with me. He was like, cool.
[19:11.940 --> 19:15.980]  I guess you could do this for me. And then he left and I went to work. Yeah.
[19:16.100 --> 19:19.940]  That's basically that place didn't have a lot of order. It didn't have any paperwork.
[19:20.300 --> 19:21.580]  No, he was from a,
[19:21.660 --> 19:26.180]  he was from North Carolina and he was an older guy and he had the exact
[19:26.180 --> 19:30.020]  attitude you think an older weed grower from North Carolina would have as long
[19:30.020 --> 19:33.500]  as the weed grew, landed on the shelf, turned into money. We got paychecks.
[19:33.860 --> 19:36.020]  I think everything else is going to be all right. Yeah. That's,
[19:36.100 --> 19:38.740]  he didn't give too much of a shit. So eventually,
[19:38.740 --> 19:43.500]  unfortunately that dispensary was closed by our city. Uh, I saw it coming.
[19:43.500 --> 19:46.460]  We knew it was going to happen. Shit was evolving. City came in,
[19:46.460 --> 19:49.220]  politely closed us. They could have done it much more aggressively.
[19:49.220 --> 19:52.380]  We could have all been arrested. Yeah. They came in and said, Hey,
[19:52.380 --> 19:55.420]  please quit. And we were given the opportunity to close the doors.
[19:55.540 --> 19:57.900]  Our smart ass answer was what about all the people in line?
[19:58.140 --> 20:01.260]  They were kind enough to let us serve the people in line. When they came in,
[20:01.380 --> 20:04.340]  a few people got up and booked. As soon as they saw a cop come in,
[20:04.660 --> 20:08.020]  they were gone. But a few people were like, I've got a medical marijuana card.
[20:08.020 --> 20:11.140]  They can't fuck with me. I know the rules. Those people that stayed,
[20:11.620 --> 20:14.220]  I gave them most of the product we had on hand.
[20:14.220 --> 20:17.140]  I split all of the remaining product with the permission of the owner and the
[20:17.140 --> 20:17.900]  manager.
[20:17.900 --> 20:21.780]  I split all of the product up amongst the last customers and the last employees
[20:21.780 --> 20:25.140]  in the building. I was like, it's our last day here. Here's all of our bonus checks.
[20:25.140 --> 20:28.980]  We can't sell it. Let's have a good time. So the dispensary closed.
[20:29.860 --> 20:33.340]  Yeah. At that point, a chunk of edibles that day. Yeah. Dude,
[20:33.340 --> 20:35.900]  we all loaded loaded up that day and it was all legit. You guys,
[20:35.900 --> 20:39.220]  we didn't steal anything. The owner was standing there next to us. So, um,
[20:39.900 --> 20:42.660]  at that point, Mike kind of became my helper.
[20:42.700 --> 20:43.940]  He was already one of my best friends.
[20:43.940 --> 20:45.740]  He'd fucking earned his spot of being my bro.
[20:45.740 --> 20:49.380]  He was in the passenger seat of my van. He was fucking my video game buddy. Uh,
[20:49.420 --> 20:52.300]  we had a good time. Mike and I ended up hanging out a lot. He became my helper,
[20:52.700 --> 20:56.740]  uh, in my personal grow and anywhere else that we went, Mike would just be in my
[20:56.740 --> 20:59.980]  van. He kind of became my main trimmer. Mike would be there.
[20:59.980 --> 21:03.660]  If I was trimming herb, I could count on Mike being there. He was my girl helper.
[21:03.660 --> 21:05.940]  He could build shit. Uh, most importantly,
[21:05.940 --> 21:08.620]  he became one of my very best friends. I don't talk about that enough, bro.
[21:08.620 --> 21:11.220]  We've got a business relationship, but bro, you're always fucking,
[21:11.220 --> 21:14.420]  I can count on you. I love that shit. So thank you. Uh, then also,
[21:14.780 --> 21:19.540]  this is not official, but Mike is my lawyer. Mike is my, I know that's not right.
[21:19.700 --> 21:22.780]  You're not my lawyer. He is not credited to be a lawyer,
[21:23.340 --> 21:26.300]  but Mike is my free lawyer. He's my free lawyer.
[21:26.340 --> 21:29.940]  The other lawyer costs like $2,000 an hour. I can call Mike and go, Hey,
[21:29.940 --> 21:32.420]  can you answer this? Or do I need to call the expensive guy?
[21:32.980 --> 21:35.580]  The screening questions like, Hey, here's what's going on.
[21:35.580 --> 21:38.340]  Do I have to call the real lawyer and pay him? Or yeah.
[21:38.380 --> 21:41.140]  Do I call the Italian guy or do I fucking talk to you about this?
[21:41.380 --> 21:43.060]  And so Mike can answer half of my questions.
[21:43.980 --> 21:48.900]  And that ladies and gentlemen is how Mike got his name. White Mike. Um,
[21:49.220 --> 21:52.340]  it's a joke. I made it as a joke because, uh,
[21:53.220 --> 21:56.940]  it's just such a white guy, dude. He's from Parker. He wears a Genco's.
[21:56.940 --> 21:58.420]  He listens to fucking three 11.
[21:58.660 --> 22:02.260]  And if I have weed in the car and I go fast, he says, buddy,
[22:02.500 --> 22:05.060]  decide if you want to have weed or go fast.
[22:05.140 --> 22:07.860]  One lot break one lot of time. Like if you're going to break a law,
[22:07.900 --> 22:09.460]  one at a time, that's the way to do it.
[22:09.660 --> 22:12.340]  Those are the reasons that make you white Mike. Like,
[22:12.580 --> 22:16.420]  and I have no problem with it. I love it. Every guy I'm kind of a rebel.
[22:16.620 --> 22:17.740]  I'm kind of a loose cannon.
[22:17.740 --> 22:22.740]  I forget sometimes that I'm smoking a joint driving 90 talking on my phone,
[22:23.540 --> 22:26.500]  like all of this shit I shouldn't be doing. And Michael go, Hey,
[22:26.820 --> 22:29.020]  slow down, put the phone away or put the joint out.
[22:29.020 --> 22:31.580]  We can't do all of this buddy. And I'm like, Oh, thank you, Mike.
[22:31.580 --> 22:34.740]  I'm really glad you're in the passenger seat because sometimes I get a little
[22:34.740 --> 22:38.140]  fucking carried away. So Mike became white Mike for that reason.
[22:38.140 --> 22:40.700]  If it bothers you that I call him white Mike is all in love.
[22:40.700 --> 22:42.940]  It's all in good fun. Look how fucking pasty he is.
[22:42.940 --> 22:44.780]  We got him on a video here. You can see his right.
[22:45.020 --> 22:49.340]  Extra pasty right now. He's from Colorado. He says, bro, he's wearing a beanie.
[22:49.340 --> 22:53.940]  He's got Jenco's on. Yeah. He's qualifies as white Mike. It's nothing racist.
[22:53.980 --> 22:56.500]  I think it's all in good fun. So that's where white Mike,
[22:56.780 --> 22:58.300]  the nickname white Mike came from.
[22:58.300 --> 23:02.020]  I gave that one to him because if I needed somebody to research something,
[23:02.140 --> 23:05.620]  tell me about a law, fill out some paperwork, some white guy shit,
[23:05.820 --> 23:09.460]  Mike would do it for me. Michael do the white guy shit. That's my gig.
[23:10.300 --> 23:12.500]  So that is a little, excuse the throat clearing guys.
[23:12.500 --> 23:16.700]  I'm going to blame that on our friends at a first matter premium concentrates.
[23:16.940 --> 23:18.180]  Shout out for the fatty dads.
[23:18.380 --> 23:20.900]  So I'm crossing off all the shit that I've covered here because we do have an
[23:20.900 --> 23:23.780]  extensive interview. I'm trying to be a good interviewer. Mike,
[23:23.780 --> 23:28.140]  we've covered up to the point where I met you and you became my bud tender and
[23:28.140 --> 23:31.060]  my bro. And that's our little interest. That's our origin story.
[23:31.340 --> 23:33.660]  Also, I got to mention that in that same time period,
[23:33.660 --> 23:37.860]  Mike got me involved in the cannabis community,
[23:37.860 --> 23:40.420]  going to city council meetings. That's what I'm trying to say. City council.
[23:40.420 --> 23:42.140]  I would have never gone to city council meetings.
[23:42.140 --> 23:44.180]  I would not have gotten politically active.
[23:44.180 --> 23:47.300]  That would not be part of my repertoire if it weren't for Mike.
[23:47.300 --> 23:51.700]  So I feel like that's where Mike shines is on the paperwork, the activism,
[23:51.860 --> 23:56.060]  the well-spoken side. I do this jammering fucking bro talk.
[23:56.060 --> 23:58.980]  And I do the grow and the cultivation. I'd be the cartoon character.
[23:59.260 --> 24:02.500]  Mike does the white guy shit. So, um,
[24:02.620 --> 24:07.300]  he introduced me to the city council part and kind of taught me how to tighten up
[24:07.300 --> 24:11.740]  my game a little bit. So that's where Mike came in, in my world. Sorry about that.
[24:11.740 --> 24:13.340]  That was gross. Now where I want to jump to is,
[24:13.540 --> 24:18.300]  can you tell us what you were doing before you got into the cannabis game?
[24:18.300 --> 24:20.180]  You don't have to reveal too much that you're not comfortable with.
[24:20.180 --> 24:21.580]  What were you doing before the weed game, bro?
[24:22.020 --> 24:23.660]  Um, how far back should I go?
[24:24.020 --> 24:26.380]  As far as you're comfortable, man, let's do the day you were born.
[24:26.380 --> 24:28.740]  What were you thinking when he looked up and saw the bright lights?
[24:28.780 --> 24:29.620]  I'm just kidding.
[24:29.900 --> 24:31.700]  Yeah. When Mike was born in a long,
[24:31.700 --> 24:33.660]  maybe let's start at what got you smoking weed.
[24:34.060 --> 24:39.060]  Um, uh, what got me smoking weed?
[24:39.340 --> 24:40.860]  Yeah. Where did you see whole weed?
[24:41.700 --> 24:45.380]  Man. I just remember every, everybody was obsessed with it in school.
[24:45.500 --> 24:48.460]  Like I grew up in,
[24:48.460 --> 24:52.300]  Jeff mentioned it Parker, Colorado in the eighties and nineties.
[24:53.100 --> 24:56.580]  Um, the parents movement at the time,
[24:56.580 --> 24:58.860]  the anti-drug parents movement was a big thing.
[24:59.220 --> 25:03.140]  Drugs in schools were a big thing. Gangs in schools were a big thing. I mean,
[25:03.140 --> 25:05.020]  none of this shit really existed in Parker,
[25:05.420 --> 25:08.860]  but they were fucking super paranoid about it. And so
[25:09.540 --> 25:12.100]  Parker is just a little suburb outside of Denver,
[25:12.100 --> 25:16.140]  just a few miles outside of Denver. It's real suburb. It's real nice.
[25:16.340 --> 25:17.180]  Nothing to worry about.
[25:17.180 --> 25:19.740]  Douglas County, Colorado for most of my childhood,
[25:19.740 --> 25:22.380]  it was the fastest growing County in the United States.
[25:23.220 --> 25:24.060]  Um, that's pretty cool.
[25:24.500 --> 25:27.460]  I like to, I like to joke that we didn't have white people in my town when,
[25:27.660 --> 25:30.580]  or we didn't have a nonwhite people in my town when I was growing up.
[25:31.060 --> 25:33.060]  And that's why the cops fucked with the teenagers so much.
[25:33.060 --> 25:34.700]  Cause there were no minorities to screw with.
[25:35.580 --> 25:37.620]  That's actually true. And it's weirdly true.
[25:37.620 --> 25:41.100]  Super true about Parker. Um, like I remember in middle school,
[25:41.100 --> 25:44.140]  we used to make the one black girl stand up and talk about what it was like to
[25:44.140 --> 25:45.260]  be black in February.
[25:45.740 --> 25:49.340]  And then the one Jewish kid get up in December and talk about what it was like,
[25:49.340 --> 25:51.980]  not to have a Christmas tree. Like it was really fucked up.
[25:52.060 --> 25:55.580]  The eighties were a weird time. If you're a lot younger than me and Jeff,
[25:55.580 --> 25:58.940]  and this sounds insane. That's just what we did to people back then.
[26:00.020 --> 26:04.260]  Um, but all the way through school, they kept bringing it up. Marijuana,
[26:04.260 --> 26:05.580]  people are going to offer you marijuana.
[26:05.580 --> 26:07.700]  Every time I went to Denver with my parents, I was like,
[26:07.700 --> 26:11.020]  where the drug dealers at? Like, why aren't they trying to sell me drugs?
[26:11.020 --> 26:13.940]  You give me free drugs. You get me hooked on drugs. I'm confused.
[26:13.980 --> 26:17.380]  They're lying to me in school or something. Just waiting for those guys. Um,
[26:18.100 --> 26:21.220]  and then, uh, I was sitting in the hall at school,
[26:21.220 --> 26:26.100]  working on a group project and this kid that
[26:26.140 --> 26:29.740]  lived up the street from me comes whipping around the corner of the hallway,
[26:29.740 --> 26:33.180]  like power walking. And as he came around the corner,
[26:33.820 --> 26:37.540]  he pulled his hand out of his pocket and threw something at me and it hit me in
[26:37.580 --> 26:40.220]  my chest. And I didn't know what the fuck was happening,
[26:40.580 --> 26:43.980]  but I had the presence of mind to flip my shirt over whatever just hit me.
[26:44.580 --> 26:49.020]  And two teachers came running around the corner right behind him. And we're like,
[26:49.020 --> 26:51.780]  Hey, not so fast. Like stay where we can see you.
[26:52.220 --> 26:54.940]  And we're kind of like marching him off to the office or something.
[26:55.580 --> 26:56.780]  And after they passed,
[26:56.780 --> 26:59.700]  I looked down and the two kids that were working on the project myth with me,
[26:59.700 --> 27:02.900]  we're like, what the fuck just happened? And I looked down and it was like,
[27:03.340 --> 27:06.780]  I know enough from health class to know that I just got hit in the chest with a
[27:06.780 --> 27:07.740]  bag full of weed.
[27:08.700 --> 27:09.540]  Um,
[27:10.380 --> 27:13.700]  from whoever you believe in that kid was Allah or job or Buddha.
[27:14.060 --> 27:16.740]  Yeah. True story. My first guy going in was fucking thrown at me.
[27:16.820 --> 27:18.860]  It's perfect. Um, it was meant to be dude.
[27:18.900 --> 27:19.900]  Shout out to David.
[27:20.100 --> 27:23.940]  I'm really glad I asked how you got into the weed. He knows who he is, bro.
[27:23.940 --> 27:24.900]  He knows who he is.
[27:25.100 --> 27:26.420]  Yep. I, uh,
[27:27.180 --> 27:29.580]  I ended up taking that home and trying to smoke it.
[27:29.580 --> 27:31.740]  Like I think it was a pop can with whole smoked in it.
[27:32.460 --> 27:35.620]  And I just burnt myself a couple of times and was like,
[27:35.620 --> 27:38.380]  is this what being high is like? Um,
[27:40.700 --> 27:43.420]  and it was God years later, two,
[27:43.420 --> 27:47.100]  three years later before I actually got good and stoned in, uh,
[27:47.140 --> 27:51.180]  someone named Mandy's, uh, Ma I can't remember which parent,
[27:51.180 --> 27:52.260]  I think her mom's garage.
[27:52.820 --> 27:55.980]  Now you're snitching on Mandy to your fucking name, dropping on everybody,
[27:55.980 --> 27:59.500]  dude, dropping names on everybody. It was 30 years ago.
[27:59.500 --> 28:01.300]  If you can find these people, tell him I said, hi.
[28:02.020 --> 28:04.220]  All right. So you get hit in the back, in the chest with a bag of weed.
[28:04.220 --> 28:06.820]  And then you go smoke with some young innocent girl named Mandy.
[28:07.020 --> 28:09.220]  Yep. Man, you got me nice and stoned.
[28:09.740 --> 28:12.300]  And those are the first couple of times I got introduced to weed.
[28:12.700 --> 28:14.140]  All right. That's high school time, right?
[28:14.940 --> 28:16.260]  Yep. Then you go to college.
[28:17.340 --> 28:20.940]  Eighth grade. And then maybe eighth grade,
[28:20.940 --> 28:22.900]  I got hit in the chest with weed, maybe seventh grade.
[28:24.140 --> 28:28.060]  Okay. And, uh, Mandy's garage, I wasn't driving yet.
[28:28.060 --> 28:30.740]  So I had to be in 15 sophomore in high school, freshman high school.
[28:30.820 --> 28:32.980]  All right. That's about the same time. Most of us start smoking.
[28:32.980 --> 28:33.700]  I went a little younger,
[28:33.700 --> 28:37.020]  but then I had a break because I moved away from home and had to find my new
[28:37.020 --> 28:37.860]  crew and all that.
[28:37.860 --> 28:38.660]  Find a new plug.
[28:39.180 --> 28:42.020]  Yeah. Yeah. Well where I'm from, dude, everybody fucking smokes weed.
[28:42.020 --> 28:44.940]  So it's just, it's easy in California. Like you have to not smoke weed.
[28:44.940 --> 28:46.980]  It's more challenging. All right.
[28:46.980 --> 28:49.860]  So we got you smoking about fucking 15 years old.
[28:50.140 --> 28:51.340]  You smoke all the way through high school.
[28:52.140 --> 28:56.660]  Yeah. Um, from the time I was 15 through now.
[28:57.140 --> 28:59.620]  All right. So college, all that good shit. All right.
[28:59.620 --> 29:02.380]  That puts me back to, uh, where were you right before the industry?
[29:02.380 --> 29:03.700]  What kind of, I know you're well-educated,
[29:03.700 --> 29:06.620]  so what kind of education you got and then where, what segues you into weed?
[29:08.180 --> 29:11.060]  Um, in college I studied sociology and psychology,
[29:11.060 --> 29:15.660]  so I took a lot of drugs classes, drugs and society type stuff. Um,
[29:15.700 --> 29:20.260]  drug policy type stuff, history of drug policy. Um,
[29:22.020 --> 29:25.140]  one of the things that blew my mind, one of the first drugs classes I took,
[29:25.620 --> 29:28.540]  the class started the history of drugs with salt and pepper.
[29:29.140 --> 29:30.380]  Like that's where it started out.
[29:30.380 --> 29:32.660]  And if you look at the history of the spice trade,
[29:33.140 --> 29:36.340]  it's exactly like the modern marijuana market. Like it's fun.
[29:36.540 --> 29:37.460]  Makes total sense to me.
[29:38.540 --> 29:41.580]  But, uh, when I graduated college,
[29:41.620 --> 29:44.940]  the goal was to go work with, uh, at risk youth.
[29:44.980 --> 29:47.820]  I wanted to go help teenagers that kind of had a shitty run of it,
[29:48.420 --> 29:52.300]  get their feedback under them. Um, so they didn't turn into shitty adults.
[29:53.020 --> 29:57.540]  And I went and worked with locked up teens for a couple of years and got injured.
[29:58.140 --> 30:02.620]  Um, and as I was trying to figure out what I was going to do after that,
[30:03.540 --> 30:08.380]  a friend of mine came down with what eventually we learned was MS.
[30:09.180 --> 30:13.980]  And, um, we just sort of trial and error. He,
[30:13.980 --> 30:15.140]  uh, he was miserable.
[30:15.140 --> 30:19.380]  He had to do like four weeks straight in the hospital where they did test after
[30:19.380 --> 30:21.540]  test and blood draw after blood draw.
[30:22.380 --> 30:25.180]  And he was living with me at the time.
[30:25.980 --> 30:26.900]  And I, uh,
[30:26.900 --> 30:29.900]  I called him the day was before I went to go pick him up from the hospital.
[30:29.900 --> 30:32.380]  And I was like, dude, what do you want for your homecoming?
[30:32.940 --> 30:35.140]  And he was like, I'm fucking miserable. I just want to be home.
[30:35.700 --> 30:37.700]  I want to take a shower. And he's like, I want to get stoned,
[30:37.700 --> 30:41.820]  like clean the bong and have some good weed waiting for me.
[30:41.860 --> 30:45.620]  And this was 2004, maybe, um,
[30:45.660 --> 30:49.900]  2005 at the latest. Okay. Um,
[30:50.140 --> 30:53.940]  so Colorado went medical in 2000, but nothing existed yet.
[30:53.940 --> 30:55.460]  There was no dispensaries.
[30:55.460 --> 30:59.860]  There was two or three or four doctors across the state
[31:00.460 --> 31:01.620]  signing paperwork.
[31:02.220 --> 31:05.100]  It's real hot at the time, but it existed, but it was real quiet.
[31:05.100 --> 31:07.860]  Nobody talked about it. Nobody knew where to really get it. Yeah.
[31:08.340 --> 31:10.940]  Um, and, uh,
[31:10.980 --> 31:15.940]  so my buddy comes home from the hospital and he's 24
[31:16.500 --> 31:19.900]  and he needs a walker to walk, to get around, not a cane,
[31:19.940 --> 31:24.460]  but like the four leg metal half box walker.
[31:24.700 --> 31:26.460]  Yeah. And you were injured at work too.
[31:26.460 --> 31:28.060]  So were you hurting at the same time or?
[31:28.100 --> 31:32.980]  My neck was messed up and it was giving me weird pain signals down my left
[31:32.980 --> 31:36.220]  arm. Okay. And so my left hand kind of always hurt.
[31:36.220 --> 31:40.420]  And I was always massaging the little V part. You still do that? Yeah.
[31:40.420 --> 31:44.500]  It's I literally, my neck's not fixed. Um,
[31:44.660 --> 31:49.380]  and when I haven't been keeping up with my CBD THC regimen and the
[31:49.380 --> 31:53.980]  stretches that I do and the inflammation builds up, the pain comes right back.
[31:54.700 --> 31:57.740]  Uh, I see you when we're, when we're hanging out, when you get the fidgets,
[31:57.740 --> 31:59.940]  you start pulling on your thumbs and stretching your hands out.
[31:59.940 --> 32:03.060]  I see you go right for it. When after a couple of dabs, you start stretching out.
[32:04.420 --> 32:07.740]  Sorry. I cut you right off. So Mike, uh, Dave's in a walker.
[32:08.140 --> 32:13.020]  Dave comes home and, uh, he's got to use a walker to get around. And, uh,
[32:14.020 --> 32:14.860]  um,
[32:15.860 --> 32:19.460]  we get stoned that night and I mean, it was rough.
[32:19.460 --> 32:22.540]  He was having trouble talking. Um,
[32:24.020 --> 32:25.340]  he he'd think this,
[32:25.580 --> 32:30.140]  think of a sentence like I went to the store and bought cheese and he'd go to say
[32:30.140 --> 32:32.860]  it and his brain would just pause and it wouldn't want to say store.
[32:33.700 --> 32:34.700]  And so we'd go, I went to the,
[32:35.100 --> 32:39.180]  and he kind of look at you for a minute and have to look down and the place where
[32:39.180 --> 32:41.180]  you buy things and it's like store. And he's like, yeah,
[32:41.180 --> 32:44.260]  I fucking went to the store and I bought cheese. It was just brutal.
[32:44.620 --> 32:48.700]  Seeing my buddy kind of pulled back like that. Cause he was like,
[32:49.260 --> 32:54.260]  good at picking up girls and in the military and athletic and fast cars and shit
[32:54.620 --> 32:58.420]  like that. And all of a sudden now he's a walker and he's struggling to talk and
[32:58.740 --> 33:02.060]  struggling to talk. It was rough to see. And, uh,
[33:03.220 --> 33:07.380]  he takes a couple of bong heads and, um,
[33:07.420 --> 33:10.620]  stands up to go to the bathroom and just walks to the bathroom.
[33:11.580 --> 33:15.900]  And he didn't catch it either until he opened the door and he saw his walker
[33:15.900 --> 33:19.220]  sitting next to the chair. And then he looked at his feet, was like,
[33:19.220 --> 33:20.060]  what the fuck?
[33:20.540 --> 33:24.740]  It was the first time in six weeks that I've been able to walk 10 feet without
[33:24.740 --> 33:28.020]  tripling over my own feet and falling down without my walker.
[33:28.340 --> 33:29.500]  That is fucking incredible.
[33:30.060 --> 33:31.620]  And he sits down and he goes,
[33:31.620 --> 33:35.980]  did you notice that I didn't need my walker? And I go,
[33:35.980 --> 33:38.700]  did you notice you didn't stumble all over that sentence?
[33:39.700 --> 33:43.980]  And we both just sort of stared at each other for a minute going, dude, dude,
[33:45.700 --> 33:48.260]  before like, well, more bong hits, we need to test this.
[33:48.740 --> 33:50.220]  And after like three or four days,
[33:50.220 --> 33:54.180]  it was crystal clear that cannabis was medically beneficial for him.
[33:54.340 --> 33:56.260]  That's awesome. Um, to put it mildly.
[33:57.140 --> 33:58.380]  And then became,
[33:58.420 --> 34:03.420]  we began like a year long journey of getting him a medical marijuana card.
[34:04.260 --> 34:06.140]  Right. Because I said earlier, yeah,
[34:06.180 --> 34:07.820]  yeah. No doctors docs. Yeah.
[34:08.100 --> 34:12.500]  You couldn't just Google pot doc. There was no weed maps.
[34:12.500 --> 34:16.820]  There were no dispensaries. There were no Sanjay Gupta specials,
[34:16.860 --> 34:17.700]  nothing.
[34:18.060 --> 34:21.700]  You had to find somebody had to leave a business card on your car or something
[34:21.700 --> 34:24.860]  weird like that. There were weird ways of finding dispensaries back in the day.
[34:25.020 --> 34:28.500]  Yeah. Um, I spent
[34:31.300 --> 34:34.180]  a cup, probably 50 hours digging through forums.
[34:34.980 --> 34:39.980]  And I found some doctor's name and a couple of lawyers names and,
[34:41.500 --> 34:44.100]  um, was able to get them an appointment.
[34:44.700 --> 34:47.420]  And back then it was a couple hundred dollars for the appointment.
[34:47.940 --> 34:49.820]  It was a couple hundred dollars for the card.
[34:50.780 --> 34:52.780]  And once you got the card,
[34:52.820 --> 34:57.820]  all it meant was after the cop arrests you and you end up in front of a judge,
[34:58.660 --> 35:03.660]  you've got some paperwork to help try to get you out of trouble is all it meant
[35:03.660 --> 35:06.340]  then. But I was able to get him that far.
[35:06.740 --> 35:07.740]  And you can chop at the store.
[35:09.140 --> 35:13.100]  There was no stores, right? Um, nothing existed.
[35:13.100 --> 35:17.700]  Then if it was just, you got caught with purely black market herb, um,
[35:17.740 --> 35:22.740]  you were allowed to have it. Um, you could grow your six plants and a story.
[35:23.660 --> 35:26.540]  Um, there were no rules back then. None was allowed.
[35:26.820 --> 35:28.420]  Rules back then. None whatsoever.
[35:28.900 --> 35:33.180]  Other than the original framework of amendment 20. Um,
[35:33.620 --> 35:34.660]  took me a minute to remember.
[35:34.660 --> 35:39.100]  Amendment 20. I saw you searching for us. Let's say 64 20. Um,
[35:39.140 --> 35:42.140]  so it was, it took us about a year to get Dave his card.
[35:42.780 --> 35:47.540]  And about the same time, um,
[35:47.580 --> 35:51.780]  my now wife then girlfriend and I started to get more serious and we started to
[35:51.780 --> 35:56.340]  come down here and spend more time with her family and her, um,
[35:56.740 --> 36:00.780]  dad is sicker than shit and always has been. Um,
[36:00.820 --> 36:01.940]  and a couple of those,
[36:02.020 --> 36:06.980]  his ailments are on the list for amendment 20 for a medical
[36:06.980 --> 36:10.980]  marijuana card. And he's been, you know, 10 joints a day,
[36:10.980 --> 36:15.260]  keep the doctor away since he was in his twenties. And I said,
[36:15.260 --> 36:18.100]  you're fucking nuts. Why don't we get you a card? He was like, well, what,
[36:18.140 --> 36:19.620]  what's, what are you even talking about?
[36:20.180 --> 36:24.500]  And so I started a process of getting him a card and that took another six or
[36:24.660 --> 36:27.260]  eight months. And by the time I got him a card,
[36:27.860 --> 36:31.020]  I had found two or three more people that needed help doing that.
[36:31.460 --> 36:36.020]  And so my first job in the industry was helping sick patients get a
[36:36.300 --> 36:37.900]  proper medical marijuana cards.
[36:37.980 --> 36:41.180]  That's pretty cool. Uh, you said come down here. Uh, we're in Pueblo.
[36:41.180 --> 36:43.300]  So we're in Pueblo. So I was coming down from Denver,
[36:43.340 --> 36:44.340]  driving down from Denver.
[36:44.340 --> 36:47.140]  It's about 130 miles to come spend time with the wife's family,
[36:47.140 --> 36:48.540]  the girlfriend's family at the time.
[36:48.820 --> 36:51.940]  And the old man he's talking about is the guy that I met him through.
[36:51.940 --> 36:53.500]  So that's our buddy. Can I say his name? Dude?
[36:53.540 --> 36:56.940]  Like Steve, a couple of years later he would introduce me to Jeff. Yeah.
[36:57.420 --> 37:01.260]  Yeah. Um, so, uh, so that's how you got into it.
[37:01.260 --> 37:03.500]  You were helping Dave out. Then you got Steve, his card.
[37:03.500 --> 37:07.660]  You got a couple of your friends, their cards. Uh, you got yourself a card. Uh,
[37:08.100 --> 37:12.660]  how is Dave now, bro? Wonderful. Mary just had a baby, beautiful baby girl.
[37:12.780 --> 37:15.260]  Excellent. I like hearing that, bro. You helped him get through that.
[37:15.580 --> 37:17.500]  Right before the pandemic, that a kid.
[37:17.980 --> 37:20.060]  Perfect timing, dude. Something to keep them occupied.
[37:20.780 --> 37:21.900]  Right. Something to keep them busy.
[37:21.900 --> 37:24.100]  And they're probably going to make another one during the fucking pandemic too.
[37:24.660 --> 37:25.980]  Um, so a lot of people are,
[37:26.420 --> 37:29.380]  we got up to when you started coming down and hanging out with Steve,
[37:29.380 --> 37:33.660]  how long until you run into me at the dispensary when you start hanging out
[37:33.660 --> 37:35.340]  with Steve and coming down here to get medicine?
[37:37.340 --> 37:42.100]  So I started coming down here for medicine and
[37:43.020 --> 37:48.140]  regularly, like maybe 2000,
[37:48.380 --> 37:49.220]  2000.
[37:50.380 --> 37:57.800]  It's gotta be six or seven inch for the listeners.
[37:59.080 --> 38:01.120]  Sorry. It would have been, I I'm listening.
[38:01.120 --> 38:02.600]  My baby monitor just started going off.
[38:02.600 --> 38:05.200]  So I was listening to that while I was trying to count back in years,
[38:05.680 --> 38:10.400]  it would have been 2006, 2007, early 2007. Okay. Um,
[38:10.960 --> 38:14.880]  I knew a couple of medical patients down here that I had met through Steve,
[38:15.840 --> 38:19.840]  um, that had pretty solid. Um,
[38:20.200 --> 38:23.000]  uh, we might have to hit pause, bro. We need to take a break. We can't make a bottle.
[38:23.360 --> 38:27.080]  No worries. Yep. Good. It's calling a break. Hold on.
[38:28.080 --> 38:29.600]  All right, buddy. Welcome back to the show.
[38:29.600 --> 38:33.920]  How's everything going in family life? Well, you're still muted.
[38:36.560 --> 38:39.080]  Pretty good, man. I hope little man goes right back to sleep.
[38:39.360 --> 38:40.640]  Yeah. No worries if he doesn't bro.
[38:40.680 --> 38:43.280]  It's a family time and we can take another break if we need to.
[38:43.280 --> 38:46.480]  I'm good at editing and I might not even edit out that middle section there.
[38:46.480 --> 38:47.640]  Cause I just talked for a moment.
[38:47.640 --> 38:50.800]  So if the listeners heard all that gibberish, I didn't edit.
[38:50.920 --> 38:52.480]  And if they didn't hear a bunch of gibberish,
[38:52.520 --> 38:54.240]  I did edit and we'll just keep going.
[38:54.520 --> 38:56.920]  Now I've got a good reason to listen to this episode or watch this,
[38:57.680 --> 39:02.040]  checking out how I look live, but, uh, see what she was rambling about.
[39:02.120 --> 39:03.040]  You're doing a good job, bro.
[39:03.040 --> 39:06.240]  I was talking about how good of a job we are doing as an interview team
[39:06.240 --> 39:07.080]  together.
[39:07.320 --> 39:10.280]  Well, we're, uh, where were we when Ethan cried?
[39:11.360 --> 39:13.840]  Oops. See, I made it a point not to see your kids' names on the show.
[39:14.640 --> 39:18.800]  When I first started coming down here back in 2006 or seven.
[39:18.960 --> 39:22.720]  Yeah. Yeah. Coming down, uh, teamed up with Steve. Uh,
[39:22.720 --> 39:24.920]  we could just jump to the part where we kind of met, right.
[39:24.920 --> 39:27.400]  We ended up fucking becoming homies through Metamar.
[39:27.840 --> 39:31.200]  Yeah. It, uh, Metamar, uh,
[39:31.680 --> 39:33.560]  my father-in-law came home like,
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.840]  like giggly school girl excited. Like he healed every guy's fucking
[39:41.800 --> 39:45.040]  weed stores, man. Beck, it's such a,
[39:46.560 --> 39:49.360]  we're so used to it now. Yeah. Um,
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.160]  I have to check in with prohibition landed to kind of ground myself and get a
[39:55.040 --> 40:00.000]  feel for what it's like in, in non-medical non-recreational places now.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.160]  Cause fucking Colorado is the future, bro. Oh, dude.
[40:03.240 --> 40:07.760]  I know we were spoiled and I forget. So spoiled, so spoiled.
[40:08.560 --> 40:10.280]  Um, it wasn't long ago.
[40:10.280 --> 40:15.280]  I was in Texas in the airport and I asked the lady at the newsstand for a recent
[40:15.520 --> 40:18.160]  copy of high times. And she was like, we don't carry that here.
[40:18.800 --> 40:21.360]  Like we can't carry stuff about illegal narcotics.
[40:23.640 --> 40:28.000]  This is like 2018. Um, it, yeah,
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.840]  we're in the future here in Colorado and we have to remind ourselves of that
[40:30.840 --> 40:34.760]  shit sometimes. But like Steve comes home with, there's a weed store downtown.
[40:34.760 --> 40:37.680]  You gotta, you're never gonna, you gotta get the car. We gotta go.
[40:38.080 --> 40:41.280]  I was now going now. You're never going to believe this. Like I,
[40:41.320 --> 40:44.440]  you gotta go before the cops show up. You gotta see this shit in action.
[40:45.240 --> 40:47.200]  And um,
[40:48.200 --> 40:52.280]  I was blown away that the quality was just as good as anything I'd been buying,
[40:52.280 --> 40:55.800]  if not better, um, anywhere else.
[40:55.840 --> 40:58.720]  Thank you. Cause I was growing a lot of that. That means a lot to me, bro.
[40:58.720 --> 41:03.000]  Thank you. Um, the price was also a little bit better.
[41:04.000 --> 41:05.720]  And you know,
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.360]  we got death threats and all kinds of problems because of combo setting up that
[41:10.360 --> 41:13.160]  price here in this area. People were angry, bro.
[41:13.400 --> 41:15.760]  Like we were worried for a minute. We're like, we may have fucked up.
[41:16.320 --> 41:20.280]  People get to experience this in every state that goes legal. But the,
[41:21.080 --> 41:24.960]  the, the price on the black market is fixed.
[41:25.560 --> 41:30.000]  And that's a beautiful part of the market because everybody gets to pretend that
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.640]  product is scarce to the point where the price is the price or fuck off.
[41:35.520 --> 41:40.520]  And as soon as there were stores where a customer could,
[41:41.320 --> 41:44.640]  you know, without a lot of bravado go, all right,
[41:44.640 --> 41:46.040]  then I'll just go to the other one.
[41:46.840 --> 41:51.200]  Like if home Depot don't want to treat me good, I'll go to Lowe's. Yep. Um,
[41:51.200 --> 41:55.640]  as soon as that's a thing, the price ain't the price cause shit's scarce no more.
[41:56.240 --> 42:00.080]  Um, and by the time Metamar had opened up,
[42:01.040 --> 42:06.040]  there was a dispensary or two in Springs and then one or two in Denver and two or
[42:07.600 --> 42:11.640]  three around the front range. And then one up in Fort Collins.
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.960]  And by the time we had real competition down here,
[42:17.640 --> 42:21.600]  the price had dropped to what? 300 an ounce or something.
[42:21.600 --> 42:25.480]  A good a hundred dollars below 280 or 320. Yeah.
[42:25.600 --> 42:30.600]  Yeah. Good. And that's down below the $400 an ounce standard black market price at
[42:31.200 --> 42:34.520]  the time. And I mean, by then the game had changed.
[42:34.560 --> 42:37.920]  And that number sounds crazy high now when I've said it. Yeah. Yeah.
[42:37.960 --> 42:42.160]  But it used to be 280 if you were a member or 320 if you weren't. And that was,
[42:42.160 --> 42:45.960]  that's a whole nother topic we'll talk about on another day. Um,
[42:46.240 --> 42:48.360]  when I was making the bottle just now,
[42:48.360 --> 42:53.360]  I was remembering the grows back then there'd be a binder where it had like
[42:55.600 --> 42:58.160]  comic book plastic sheets in it. Yeah.
[42:58.440 --> 43:02.080]  And it was people photocopies of full pages,
[43:02.160 --> 43:05.160]  the full medical marijuana application. Yeah.
[43:05.520 --> 43:07.680]  We have your application, your card, your ID,
[43:07.680 --> 43:09.480]  just so that if something did go wrong, we're like, look,
[43:09.480 --> 43:12.120]  we've got their picture or doctor recommendations.
[43:12.200 --> 43:16.280]  And the car rose when law enforcement showed up and you had to be like, all
[43:16.280 --> 43:18.920]  right, officer, like, please don't shoot. Yep.
[43:19.240 --> 43:21.760]  Like let's go through my notebook.
[43:22.040 --> 43:25.160]  We were trimming somewhere and law enforcement showed up and all we did,
[43:25.160 --> 43:27.360]  we all pulled out our medical marijuana cards and they go, yeah,
[43:27.360 --> 43:30.280]  it looks good. And they all left. They didn't care. Cause we all had a card.
[43:30.440 --> 43:33.680]  Yep. I'm going to take this dab. So you got to cover me for a moment.
[43:34.600 --> 43:39.560]  Um, but that was like 2006, seven, eight ish. Um,
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.680]  and then when the city shut Metamar down, um,
[43:44.240 --> 43:48.720]  my wife is a lawyer and my family, um, is in law.
[43:48.760 --> 43:53.760]  So when the city shut us down saying we were violating zoning rules,
[43:55.400 --> 43:59.040]  that the city council hadn't passed yet. Um,
[43:59.120 --> 44:03.920]  I got pissed and I told the owner of Metamar, we've got to fight this.
[44:04.480 --> 44:08.160]  And for various reasons, um, he said,
[44:08.160 --> 44:11.960]  I'm not in the mood to fight right now. So no. So I decided, fuck it.
[44:11.960 --> 44:13.360]  I'm going to go fight this myself.
[44:13.920 --> 44:17.040]  And if they're going to pass crazy rules like this,
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.280]  somebody from our end needs to stand up and at least have our voice heard.
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.800]  Um, cause at that point it was very much city council and County commissioners
[44:29.560 --> 44:34.160]  begrudgingly, uh, passing rules for something they didn't want.
[44:34.800 --> 44:38.480]  And when you've got a group of people making rules for something they don't
[44:38.480 --> 44:43.480]  like, the rules get asinine quick. And, uh,
[44:45.040 --> 44:47.800]  I mean, it was terrifying. The first couple of times I went and spoke,
[44:48.160 --> 44:50.040]  I think the first time I spoke up at a meeting,
[44:50.040 --> 44:53.120]  I was on the front page of the paper the next morning. Um,
[44:53.120 --> 44:55.520]  just as an extra little like, by the way,
[44:55.560 --> 44:59.960]  the nail that stands up gets hammered down first. Yep. Um,
[45:00.760 --> 45:05.600]  and then maybe a year later I was in a meeting that,
[45:05.680 --> 45:06.360]  uh,
[45:06.360 --> 45:11.360]  city council put together where people from planning and zoning and people from
[45:13.720 --> 45:18.720]  the sheriff's office and city PD and, uh,
[45:18.880 --> 45:23.400]  people from like the water department and the health department all got
[45:23.400 --> 45:27.840]  together to work on what rules do we want for home grows?
[45:28.480 --> 45:30.480]  And before the meeting got started,
[45:30.480 --> 45:35.480]  the sheriff's deputy and the city narcotics cop started talking about funny shit
[45:35.760 --> 45:37.320]  that had happened with legal pot.
[45:37.720 --> 45:42.200]  And they mentioned the closing of Metamar and that they had a surveillance
[45:42.200 --> 45:45.600]  camera on the back porch the whole time.
[45:45.600 --> 45:47.920]  And I just started giggling cause I'm sitting next to these two,
[45:47.920 --> 45:50.960]  listening to the conversation. I was like, Oh man, there was a camera there.
[45:51.520 --> 45:53.480]  Like how many of my smoke breaks did they get?
[45:55.200 --> 45:58.000]  They got me rolling joints on there for hours of footage,
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.040]  depending on how long the camera was up. That's funny. Yep. All right.
[46:02.040 --> 46:06.960]  So you said screw it just time to go full force and started hitting city council
[46:06.960 --> 46:09.320]  with whatever I felt they needed to get smacked with.
[46:09.360 --> 46:12.360]  And you went for zoning, you went for rule changes,
[46:12.680 --> 46:16.000]  you go for any sort of hearings or proposals, but new dispensaries are coming.
[46:16.040 --> 46:20.360]  More solid years of my life, man. Yeah. Yeah. You got me going to meetings, dude.
[46:20.360 --> 46:21.880]  I took other dreads to meetings.
[46:21.880 --> 46:25.000]  Like there were a little section of dreadlocks at the city council meetings.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.800]  We all tried to put on a decent shirt and show up. It's kind of fun.
[46:28.160 --> 46:30.080]  I would have never gone and done that if it weren't for you.
[46:30.120 --> 46:31.560]  So that's awesome of you.
[46:31.960 --> 46:36.160]  When they realized that I could get 10 or 15 people to show up if I wanted to,
[46:37.200 --> 46:38.920]  then they really started listening.
[46:39.600 --> 46:43.440]  Cause that's what small town politicians for the most is a little bit of crowd
[46:43.440 --> 46:45.440]  making a little bit of noise. Um,
[46:45.480 --> 46:48.480]  cause then the press shows up and then it's a real issue that they've got to
[46:48.480 --> 46:50.120]  deal with whether they want to or not.
[46:50.280 --> 46:52.640]  And we were lucky enough to have a friend in the press.
[46:52.640 --> 46:55.600]  And so they would always make sure to put our faces on the camera on the news
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.280]  there. Like people showed up. I had friends, multiple friends. Yeah. Yeah.
[47:00.320 --> 47:03.240]  Well we used to have a reporter who, if we had a cannabis story,
[47:03.240 --> 47:05.920]  you just text her and she would drive up to the house and you could give her the
[47:05.920 --> 47:10.000]  weed story. Like if she needed weed details, she would text Mike and I, well,
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.720]  Hey, tell me about weed. Tell me what's going on. We'd fill her in.
[47:12.960 --> 47:15.720]  So the news reports are almost close to accurate because of that stuff.
[47:16.280 --> 47:20.120]  For a while, man, you've done a lot of great shit in cannabis. Uh,
[47:20.480 --> 47:24.680]  like dude from getting involved to get Dave a card from being my bud tender
[47:24.680 --> 47:27.600]  assistant manager, whatever you were at Metamar, that was a stressful,
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.320]  challenging, we didn't have a name, but tending then. Yeah.
[47:31.320 --> 47:34.440]  We were inventing the rules and the systems as we happened.
[47:34.440 --> 47:37.880]  So it was really interesting and fun to watch. We had MMJ menu first.
[47:37.880 --> 47:40.760]  Like nobody had that shit before us. We were doing it on the black market.
[47:40.960 --> 47:41.800]  Kind of.
[47:42.040 --> 47:46.120]  Um, I remember like sort of inventing the,
[47:46.440 --> 47:51.440]  the smell jars and display racks and pre-rolls and.
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.880]  Dude, we had awesome displays. That dispensary always looked so good.
[47:55.880 --> 47:59.160]  We had nice good systems in place. So I've always trusted working with you, man.
[47:59.160 --> 48:02.280]  We worked at that dispensary. Then we got kind of out of the,
[48:02.440 --> 48:03.920]  there wasn't a dispensary to work at.
[48:03.920 --> 48:05.960]  And then we teamed up again for another place.
[48:06.280 --> 48:08.240]  And then we kind of worked at another place together.
[48:08.240 --> 48:09.880]  We've been through three facilities together,
[48:09.880 --> 48:13.000]  me working in the back and you working up front. It's been a lot of fun.
[48:13.000 --> 48:13.800]  Where I always try to,
[48:13.800 --> 48:16.880]  and anytime I get a place or an opportunity to bring somebody on board,
[48:16.880 --> 48:18.560]  if I'm in charge or do hiring,
[48:18.800 --> 48:20.840]  you're always a put your name at the top of the list.
[48:20.840 --> 48:24.080]  The application always goes in. Yeah. Yeah. We've been a good fucking team.
[48:24.080 --> 48:26.480]  So fist bump across fucking zoom, bro. Um,
[48:26.520 --> 48:28.160]  you've accomplished a lot of great shit.
[48:28.760 --> 48:32.040]  Do you have a favorite accomplishment in the cannabis industry?
[48:32.040 --> 48:34.800]  Cause I know them two little gremlins you got over there better be your favorite
[48:34.800 --> 48:37.160]  accomplishments, but in cannabis, what's your favorite dude?
[48:39.240 --> 48:41.840]  You can take your time. I saw you pause or the video froze.
[48:42.560 --> 48:46.920]  I'm getting, honestly, when we got Dave, his card,
[48:47.760 --> 48:50.840]  that was an every day,
[48:50.840 --> 48:54.280]  couple hours a day, year long struggle.
[48:55.600 --> 49:00.360]  Um, when that first card showed up that payoff
[49:02.000 --> 49:07.320]  that like dopamine kick, that sense of accomplishment was fucking massive.
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.520]  Yeah. Um, you can have it in the house, you can have it in the car.
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.960]  It's not going to go to jail and have MS at the same time.
[49:16.360 --> 49:19.880]  Right. Um, yeah, I,
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.400]  I couldn't imagine him, him having to go to, to jail for possession.
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.240]  Um, that would have been cruel and stupid beyond words.
[49:29.960 --> 49:33.200]  Um, and so to have, have that protection in place,
[49:33.200 --> 49:35.280]  even back then as flimsy as it was, was,
[49:35.400 --> 49:39.440]  was just astronomical and felt really good to have achieved.
[49:40.200 --> 49:41.200]  And then, uh,
[49:42.080 --> 49:45.400]  it's a silly rule and it don't matter anymore because it's been overwritten by
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.720]  the state. But, uh, I got Pueblo count or the city of Pueblo,
[49:49.760 --> 49:51.640]  not to limit plant counts.
[49:52.600 --> 49:57.600]  And that was like a three year long fight where they wanted to limit it and they
[49:57.680 --> 50:01.840]  needed to limit it. And just slowly and with reason,
[50:01.960 --> 50:06.560]  like the city doesn't want to get in between patients and doctors was my whole
[50:06.560 --> 50:08.520]  argument. And little by little,
[50:08.520 --> 50:13.520]  I won over every heart and mind wanted a fucking time. Um,
[50:14.480 --> 50:16.320]  and that felt really good. And still to this day,
[50:16.320 --> 50:18.240]  the city of Pueblo does not have a plant count limit.
[50:18.320 --> 50:19.760]  They limit you by square footage.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.680]  And the state, however, that's huge. Yep. The state limits you, but not the city.
[50:25.920 --> 50:27.520]  I'm always bitching about that state limit.
[50:29.080 --> 50:30.840]  Well, thank you, bro, for trying to keep me, uh,
[50:30.840 --> 50:33.640]  cause for a while I was able to grow quite a few plants,
[50:33.640 --> 50:36.720]  but now I'm known and people know where the fuck I am. And they,
[50:36.760 --> 50:38.800]  whoever they is, when I say, who are they?
[50:38.840 --> 50:40.760]  You've got another email address or they don't exist.
[50:40.760 --> 50:42.320]  I know their email address, bro. I've talked to them.
[50:42.720 --> 50:44.640]  They know where I am and they know what I do.
[50:44.640 --> 50:48.360]  So I got to stay one plant under the count just in case they break off a branch
[50:48.360 --> 50:49.960]  and try to tell me it's another one. Like,
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.720]  so that's not a fun game to play anymore.
[50:51.880 --> 50:54.600]  I miss the good old days when you could try to explode the basement,
[50:54.960 --> 50:57.040]  try to make the house fucking fly by putting grow lights.
[50:57.280 --> 51:00.440]  99 is the number, buddy. Those were good days.
[51:01.080 --> 51:06.080]  11th row, six recreational and five on the medical card. Yep. Five.
[51:06.280 --> 51:09.960]  Don't go six. They don't tip no motherfuckers. No, don't do it.
[51:10.360 --> 51:14.000]  So getting Davis card is your proudest accomplishment. That's cool. Um, but yeah,
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.480]  that fucking adrenaline rush when you get the first one, not to down,
[51:16.520 --> 51:17.640]  I'm not trying to steal your interview,
[51:17.640 --> 51:20.840]  but I remember getting my first card walking into that dispensary the first
[51:20.840 --> 51:21.800]  time. And it's like, wait,
[51:22.120 --> 51:24.560]  you're going to weigh it in front of me and it's the price on the menu.
[51:24.560 --> 51:27.560]  And I just order off the menu and I get the smell and you're going to wait and
[51:28.040 --> 51:31.360]  front of me and it's going to weigh 28.35 grams when I buy an ounce.
[51:31.720 --> 51:32.840]  Like, Holy shit.
[51:33.320 --> 51:36.920]  I don't have to wait in a parking lot for 45 minutes wondering if I'm just going
[51:36.920 --> 51:38.200]  to get a gun stuck in my face.
[51:38.240 --> 51:40.800]  I don't have to sit on someone's couch and listen to Tupac for fucking three
[51:40.800 --> 51:44.000]  hours while they fucking play fucking FIFA FIFA. Yeah.
[51:44.440 --> 51:48.040]  Get it on realize you just bought a gram of fucking and basil stuff in a baggie.
[51:48.080 --> 51:52.440]  Man. Yeah. Did I have a dream that somebody sold me bunk weed? What the fuck?
[51:52.920 --> 51:56.160]  I don't know. You just get the weirdest fucking dreams, dude. Other memories.
[51:56.880 --> 52:01.880]  So it's yeah. Legal is a beautiful thing. If you don't have legal work on it.
[52:03.200 --> 52:07.040]  Yeah. Yeah. Um, man, what keeps you inspired now? You've done a lot of shit.
[52:07.040 --> 52:09.080]  You got Dave settled in, you got kids now.
[52:09.080 --> 52:10.880]  What keeps you inspired in the cannabis industry?
[52:11.240 --> 52:15.040]  Just seeing what's what's next. Uh, I love seeing what's new. Um,
[52:15.080 --> 52:18.960]  it's been so much fun watching Colorado evolve.
[52:18.960 --> 52:23.080]  Like I remember going into history class as a teenager and being like,
[52:23.720 --> 52:27.800]  well, hopefully we don't have a world war three. And I mean,
[52:27.880 --> 52:31.000]  or a great depression or a prohibition.
[52:31.480 --> 52:34.120]  That's close to all three of those right now, dude. That's fucking scary.
[52:34.120 --> 52:37.000]  Shit got weird in 2020. But, uh,
[52:37.040 --> 52:39.840]  up until cannabis legalization,
[52:39.840 --> 52:44.840]  there wasn't an obvious like this is going to be in the fucking history books
[52:45.440 --> 52:46.360]  guaranteed.
[52:46.360 --> 52:51.360]  There's going to be multiple chapters on what we're living through and what we're
[52:53.640 --> 52:57.360]  doing. When I really started digging into like, wait a second,
[52:57.360 --> 52:58.960]  Colorado has legal weed.
[52:58.960 --> 53:01.600]  I kind of remember that from when I was a freshman in college,
[53:01.600 --> 53:05.600]  but it didn't mean anything other than like, good job, hippie.
[53:05.600 --> 53:08.720]  Like you're still going to jail. Um,
[53:11.200 --> 53:15.120]  but watching that evolve to what we have now. Um,
[53:15.200 --> 53:19.360]  I remember the first set of rules that came down and how we went from a thousand
[53:19.640 --> 53:23.440]  retail dispensaries to 500 overnight. Um,
[53:23.480 --> 53:26.720]  I remember watching or just watching the glass evolve.
[53:27.280 --> 53:31.120]  Like I've got this beautiful little rig right here.
[53:32.040 --> 53:36.480]  Nothing like this had ever been seen when I started doing this.
[53:36.680 --> 53:39.560]  The concentrates we smoke now were unheard of.
[53:39.600 --> 53:43.840]  If I showed you this in 2008, I'm going to bust out this diamond again,
[53:43.840 --> 53:46.720]  just cause it's that pretty. Maybe not because the container is fighting with me.
[53:46.720 --> 53:49.920]  It knows I'm on camera. So it doesn't want to open, rewind the video,
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.560]  watch that diamond at the beginning. But if I showed you this in 2008,
[53:53.560 --> 53:54.920]  you'd think I was giving you drugs.
[53:54.920 --> 53:59.040]  We would kick people out of the house for using. I really can't get it open.
[53:59.040 --> 54:01.160]  So I don't get to smoke this. It was a one-time deal.
[54:02.000 --> 54:06.920]  I, uh, I hit the dispensary the day before 420 and I got six grams of hash
[54:08.160 --> 54:12.120]  and it was in a little paper bag and I drove it home.
[54:12.440 --> 54:17.240]  But in 2004, six, one gram jars of hash, man,
[54:17.240 --> 54:21.160]  you were a drug dealer looking to distribute six grams of hash.
[54:21.920 --> 54:25.480]  Um, and in a lot of places, like if you're in Texas,
[54:25.760 --> 54:29.480]  one gram of hash and one gram of heroin are legally equal.
[54:30.120 --> 54:31.600]  You are just as fucked.
[54:31.720 --> 54:32.760]  And they weigh the container.
[54:33.240 --> 54:33.680]  Yeah.
[54:33.680 --> 54:35.120]  So your little glass jar would be.
[54:35.120 --> 54:40.320]  They take this whole glass jar and they go, that's 17 grams of hard drugs.
[54:40.920 --> 54:43.320]  Fucking enjoy life in prison, motherfucker.
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.440]  It's just Colorado's on a different plane now and watching us go from where we
[54:49.440 --> 54:52.040]  were to where we are now has been an amazing journey.
[54:52.200 --> 54:54.880]  Hasn't it been fun to be involved in it, to be a part of it?
[54:55.520 --> 54:59.160]  I maybe I'll find a hash that inspires me to finally write the book about it,
[54:59.200 --> 55:03.080]  but I wasn't going to ask about the book in this interview, bro, but the book,
[55:03.240 --> 55:04.480]  is it real? Are you going to do that?
[55:04.480 --> 55:07.680]  It used to happen. It's, it started so many times, but, uh,
[55:07.720 --> 55:11.120]  I get to like page 30 and I just stopped writing for a minute and I take a
[55:11.120 --> 55:12.640]  little break and then I never go back to it.
[55:12.720 --> 55:14.800]  Let's just put your book together. The people deserve it.
[55:14.840 --> 55:16.760]  And I want my chapter. So I'll help you write it.
[55:17.040 --> 55:19.400]  I was going to ask where do you see yourself in five years,
[55:19.400 --> 55:23.040]  but I'm just going to say, write the fucking book, dude. Right. The book.
[55:23.480 --> 55:25.600]  Yeah. Book tour. We'll say on book tour. Yeah.
[55:25.840 --> 55:28.640]  So the other part of that was where do you see cannabis in five years?
[55:28.800 --> 55:32.920]  And also the B part of that is how long do you think until we see national
[55:33.040 --> 55:35.360]  cannabis legalization? So cannabis in five years.
[55:35.360 --> 55:37.000]  And how long until it's legal everywhere?
[55:38.120 --> 55:43.000]  See, I had a better guesstimate pre pandemic.
[55:43.760 --> 55:44.600]  Oh yeah.
[55:46.040 --> 55:48.920]  Nothing's going to be the same after this folks. Like,
[55:50.400 --> 55:51.120]  I mean,
[55:51.120 --> 55:56.040]  every little facet of life is going to get tweaked to some degree,
[55:56.080 --> 55:58.480]  slightly different, 2% different everywhere.
[56:00.120 --> 56:01.840]  At least the minute,
[56:01.840 --> 56:05.520]  the stuff that almost stays the same is going to be 2% different.
[56:06.120 --> 56:10.800]  Personal greetings, no more handshakes, bro. Those are gone.
[56:12.240 --> 56:14.680]  People wearing masks at the bank. That's cool now.
[56:17.200 --> 56:18.200]  And in the dispensary.
[56:18.320 --> 56:21.240]  Buying weed in the parking lots again is cool at the dispensary.
[56:22.720 --> 56:24.600]  We got go cups now in Colorado.
[56:24.600 --> 56:28.440]  We didn't have go cups before Corona virus. Now we got go cups,
[56:29.320 --> 56:29.920]  go cups.
[56:29.920 --> 56:32.840]  For those of you who don't know is you can go to a restaurant and get a
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.800]  margarita and a plastic cup with sulfate around the top.
[56:37.360 --> 56:40.400]  As your, I promise not to drink this till I'm home officer seal.
[56:41.760 --> 56:45.520]  Just sort of like when we buy a joint now it comes in a little tube and we
[56:45.520 --> 56:47.400]  promise not to light that up until we get home.
[56:47.520 --> 56:51.560]  As long as you serve food, you're allowed to sell alcohol to go as well now.
[56:51.960 --> 56:52.880]  Yep. For right now,
[56:54.520 --> 56:58.040]  there was a rumor that the state was going to take that privilege away already.
[56:58.440 --> 57:03.040]  And they clarified that as long as the sales transaction happens inside the
[57:03.040 --> 57:03.880]  restaurant,
[57:04.120 --> 57:07.920]  meaning you ordered your shit through the app on your phone and the payment was
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.400]  technically processed inside and you're not handing someone a 20 from your car
[57:12.400 --> 57:16.000]  window. Sales still legit. Awesome. Um,
[57:16.200 --> 57:19.360]  it's so fucking arbitrary, but a lot of those are getting worked on,
[57:19.360 --> 57:22.560]  including there's a whole bunch of them for cannabis that they dialed back right
[57:22.580 --> 57:24.840]  away so that we could do curbside.
[57:25.440 --> 57:28.280]  None of that shit's going back the way it used to be. None of it.
[57:29.400 --> 57:31.480]  You need to take a break. Well, let me know. I hear the monitor going.
[57:31.520 --> 57:34.680]  You just finished that bottle. I made him. We'll see what if he goes back to sleep
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.280]  now. I bet he will. Cool. I'm probably not going to edit out the last break.
[57:38.280 --> 57:42.040]  It was interesting. That's fine. Just me. Reameron for a minute. Um,
[57:42.080 --> 57:44.400]  so, uh, to continue with that, uh,
[57:44.440 --> 57:47.880]  how long do you tell you think we have legalization or do you think we'll see
[57:47.880 --> 57:49.800]  that we should see that in our life in your lifetime?
[57:49.800 --> 57:50.960]  I don't know which one of us will live longer,
[57:50.960 --> 57:53.960]  but I hope we see that in our lifetimes right now. I mean,
[57:53.960 --> 57:57.880]  my take is Trump is truly terrified and panicked about reelection.
[57:58.720 --> 58:00.920]  And so between now and November,
[58:02.160 --> 58:03.160]  I think
[58:05.760 --> 58:08.200]  cannabis legalization is,
[58:08.240 --> 58:13.240]  it has a out of nowhere potential more than it's ever had before because the
[58:16.320 --> 58:21.000]  person in top who can really push to make it happen is as panicked as they've
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.480]  ever been. And as incompetent as they've ever been,
[58:24.440 --> 58:26.520]  if you disagree with me, you know where my Twitter is.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.600]  And if you agree, patreon.com forward slash way Mike.
[58:31.080 --> 58:35.360]  Exactly. But, uh, I honestly think that,
[58:37.320 --> 58:38.560]  um, there's a,
[58:38.640 --> 58:43.640]  maybe a 10, 15% chance that Trump tries to throw marijuana legalization is a way
[58:44.880 --> 58:49.560]  to come at, uh, Biden from the left, uh,
[58:49.600 --> 58:52.920]  right towards the end of election season.
[58:53.760 --> 58:56.880]  And honestly, it's just attrition now.
[58:57.240 --> 58:58.080]  I still wouldn't vote for it.
[58:58.080 --> 59:02.120]  More states than don't have. Yeah, I still wouldn't vote for him either.
[59:02.600 --> 59:06.040]  More states than don't have medical or, or rec now.
[59:06.680 --> 59:11.320]  And it's gotten to the point where the DEA, the FDA, um,
[59:11.320 --> 59:16.320]  NIDA are all being forced to reevaluate their positions on marijuana.
[59:17.960 --> 59:21.120]  And like, if we catch you with it,
[59:21.120 --> 59:25.000]  we'll throw you in jail is slowly becoming, there's a lot of medical uses.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.440]  We need more research. And I mean, little by little we're winning.
[59:29.080 --> 59:33.880]  And I mean, the prohibition lattice work is crumbling.
[59:33.880 --> 59:36.120]  It's just how long till it crumbles. And,
[59:36.200 --> 59:39.840]  and it's so hard to guess that now, um,
[59:39.880 --> 59:41.440]  especially during this chaos,
[59:42.120 --> 59:46.600]  society tends to swing like on a pendulum left to right,
[59:46.640 --> 59:50.680]  conservative to liberal. And if you look at the last hundred years,
[59:51.480 --> 59:55.560]  the roaring twenties like sexual liberation,
[59:56.840 --> 01:00:00.680]  uh, music, lots of liberal social advancements.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.520]  And then at the end of the center,
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.720]  at the end of the decade with the economic crash,
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.480]  things went super conservative again.
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.400]  And they stayed that way for a long time.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.120]  And we slowly worked our way back out.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.320]  And then same thing happened again in the sixties,
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.520]  the summer of love happened. And that led us to the fucking Reagan era.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:24.200]  Um, like we could fully be going through that again.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:25.880]  And honestly,
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.320]  cannabis has been on a big liberalization push for a long time.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.240]  And I don't see the pendulum swinging back on this one,
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:40.760]  but it could, it fully could. Got a lot of momentum right now. Um,
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:47.400]  the anti-pop movements never been as ginned up and is, is, um,
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:51.960]  quick with messaging as they are now. Um,
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:56.160]  they were a lot more powerful in the eighties and nineties than they are today.
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.440]  But, uh, the remnants still have plenty of oomph. Yeah.
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.320]  And they still have the full weight and backing of the federal government. So
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.320]  a lot of that generation that doesn't approve is on its way out.
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.600]  Like they're too old to keep fighting us. You know what I mean?
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:14.400]  That's the generation, two generations above us, a generation above us,
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:18.280]  the older crew doesn't approve people, our age we're in. So, um,
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:22.640]  that's definitely part of it, but not that I'm excited for old people to pass,
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.920]  but I mean, that's the opposite. That's where we're headed.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.400]  The batons got to get passed.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:28.760]  And then what are we going to have to deal with?
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.480]  What are the kids behind us going to be into?
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.480]  Man, we're going to have legalized everything pretty soon, which I'm okay with.
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.040]  But that's the thing is with prohibition, once you,
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.000]  like it's especially ridiculous when it comes to cannabis, there's,
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.920]  there's no logical reason why cannabis products of any
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:48.760]  kind should be prohibited. Um,
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:54.000]  but prohibition is a policy is, is terrible.
[01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:58.920]  It's just bad social policy. Um, and if you want to get down to it,
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.600]  the most dangerous shit in society isn't prohibited.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.920]  It's highly regulated and restricted. And under that model, it's controllable.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.720]  Um, like frighteningly kind of creepy. So, um,
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:15.880]  like you can order the parts for a nuclear bomb on the internet.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.320]  There's a really creepy story of a Nazi in Maine who did it and finished it.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:26.000]  And the only reason the terrible shit didn't happen is because he was also
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.880]  abusive and his wife killed him. Oh, wow. Uh, called the cops on herself.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.560]  And when the cops showed up, they were like, what's in the sink? And she was like,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:36.240]  Oh, that's his a bomb. Um,
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.400]  but it's, it's highly regulated and restricted. And then you look at,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.800]  stuff like narcotics and they're prohibited.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:48.000]  Don't Google that cause your Google fucking search history will be fucked
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000]  forever. Um, but then if you look at like when drugs were legal,
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:58.200]  how were they used in and whatnot. And when heroin was legal,
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.560]  housewives were drinking,
[01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.000]  a low potency oral consumption. Um,
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:09.760]  if you rent tombstone Wyatt Earp's wife, that's the drug she's hooked on. Um,
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:15.040]  and it was sort of like meth in the fifties when housewives were taking it, um,
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:19.440]  to stay perky and skinny it's, it's a much lower dose.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:23.360]  It doesn't have the overdose potential. The fucking teeth weren't falling out.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.560]  Um, like no breaking bad nonsense happening.
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.960]  It was just pharmaceutical, pure,
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.520]  clean, specific dosage,
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.520]  specific timing to take it dosage recommendations.
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.080]  Same thing with Lodnum. Uh,
[01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:45.360]  and when you really start to look at all this shit kind of as a whole picture
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.200]  thing,
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.200]  the idea that cops are going to stop people from doing heroin if they feel like
[01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:54.120]  doing heroin, like it just doesn't make any sense anymore.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.040]  People's families don't stop them from doing heroin to the cops are going to do
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:03:58.720]  it.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.320]  And if you look across society right now,
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.880]  we've got things like safe injection sites,
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:10.880]  uh, methadone clinics, um, marijuana dispensaries,
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.040]  uh,
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:16.520]  psilocybin legalization and decriminalization measures are hitting the ballots
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:20.640]  all across the country. Denver just criminalized psilocybin.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.960]  California before COVID was working on signatures to decriminalize across the
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:28.680]  state. Like the,
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:33.440]  the framework that put prohibition in place is all slowly starting to crumble.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:34.600]  Um,
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.800]  more and more people are waking up to the idea that these are terrible fucking
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.040]  policies that lead to all sorts of destruction that we're not intending.
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.760]  Um,
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.160]  when you really get into the dollar amount and where it's going and what we're
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.400]  funding with our moral high ground, it's just fucking nuts.
[01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.040]  Yep.
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.760]  Just put people in jail to keep them in jail to fuck up their lives,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.360]  to fuck up their futures, to fuck up their lives again. Yep, exactly. Mike,
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.880]  where do you see yourself in the future of cannabis? We've come a long way,
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.600]  but we're getting old. Things are getting weird.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.080]  Where do we go next?
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:09.240]  I'm in a weird place, man. Um, I don't know what's next.
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.160]  I'm a, I'm on pause right now. I was doing a bunch of consulting before COVID,
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.560]  but nobody wants to fly me to their grow to teach their fucking trim crew.
[01:05:16.560 --> 01:05:17.880]  I don't have to be idiots right now.
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.920]  So I'm mostly just hanging out with the kids at home, waiting on, uh,
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.440]  waiting to see where all this goes.
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:26.400]  What most of the fucking planet is doing right now,
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:30.360]  chilling out with the kids waiting to see where this goes. Yep. All right, Mike,
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.200]  I've got one more really important question for you.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.120]  And then we're going to wrap up this interview, dude, by the way,
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:38.760]  you've done an amazing job. Thank you for making your first zoom video.
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.320]  Thank you, bro. I appreciate that. I'm not the best interviewer in my opinion.
[01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.880]  So it was really comfortable having my best friend as my interviewee.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.760]  I had this conversation with myself a moment ago. I don't know what to call you,
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:50.200]  but the guy on that end, I was an honor to have you. Good job, bro.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.520]  You did a really good job for your first video. Keep it up. Um,
[01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.520]  the most important question of the night, bro.
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:57.640]  And I already know the answer cause we've been friends for so long,
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.760]  but I've got to include this into my interview here. Uh,
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.880]  what's your favorite strain to smoke?
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.760]  You got to go with the grateful dog. Oh man. That puts a smile on my face.
[01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.560]  Not some something that's not yours. It's gotta be a chem dog or sour diesel.
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.680]  That's been really close city. Sour, really close to the grateful dog.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.520]  The grateful dog is bred by myself.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.840]  The grateful dog is honestly a deadhead OG inbred project.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.520]  Deadhead OG is a, uh, Kim D two or no,
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.960]  it's the Kim 91 to San Fernando Valley, OG, Cush F4.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.760]  And then I got a grateful dog, select phenotype, uh,
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.720]  deadhead phenotype and I reversed it.
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:39.600]  I called the seeds that came from that were known as grateful dog.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.000]  I took another seed from that and grew it out.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:47.760]  And then I reversed the original grateful dog and put that pollen onto that
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.280]  seed. And it made more seeds. The seeds that came from that won't reverse.
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.960]  Like they, they come out real. Yeah.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:00.000]  There's a lot of weirdness going on, but I can't reverse number 77 either.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.880]  I call that one 77 to select. That one doesn't reverse.
[01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:05.080]  I could treat it with fire, silver thiosulfate and won't cross.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:09.640]  But it's really cool knowing that your favorite strain is something that I
[01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.640]  then, yeah, that's, that's awesome. Cause when I grow it,
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.040]  you always kind of drool a little bit. So that's pretty awesome.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.440]  I know it's not just the potency. Like it's,
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:23.200]  it's something in the genetics of that plant,
[01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:27.200]  just that herb in my head were meant to go together.
[01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.760]  It's something, those are two amazing genetics.
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.000]  You got OG Kush and chem dog to chem gives you that sweet stank funk and the OG
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.560]  Kush gives you similar, but more earthy. And then they both have a, yeah,
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:41.000]  it's just a beautiful combo. Uh, wasn't my original idea. I worked with it.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.640]  I kind of inbred it. I did some stuff. So, uh,
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:46.960]  that's my story and I'm sticking to it. Mike, I'm glad that's your favorite. Uh,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:47.200]  dude,
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:50.120]  we should start wrapping up before one of your kids starts going before it gets
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:55.000]  much later here. Uh, how can the fine folks find you on the social media?
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.040]  Uh, you can find me on Twitter. It's at Nemo punk 15 on, uh,
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.600]  hit me up on Facebook. It's Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws. And, uh,
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:06.480]  now you can find me on Patreon at, uh,
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.400]  patreon.com slash white Mike.
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.480]  That's awesome, dude. I'm so excited. You've got a Patrion. You guys,
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:15.280]  if you are only able to help us out, uh, one of us,
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.280]  if you're doing like a four 20 contribution to me,
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:19.640]  I go ahead and throw me two bucks and throw Mike two bucks.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.360]  I want to share that funding with Mike. He's been doing it for a while.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.360]  Yeah. Let's stack up his Patreon for a minute, you guys. And then come see me.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:28.600]  Come see me again when COVID is over,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.120]  but let's help out Mike for a couple of months while he's trapped at home and
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.960]  helping us out. Uh, Mike, uh, thank you for being on the show. Uh, dude,
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:36.720]  most importantly, thank you for being my friend, dude.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.120]  Thank you for being my friend. That's super important.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.760]  We don't talk much about that because we're just bros. We don't get all mushy,
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.320]  but like 11 years, let's keep it going. Hell yeah. Thank you, bro.
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:48.560]  I appreciate it. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
