[01:37.420 --> 01:42.660]  on this episode, I do want to make a correction. I may have misspoke. I may have gave some
[01:42.660 --> 01:46.820]  semi inaccurate information on a previous episode. I got an update and a message from
[01:46.820 --> 01:50.460]  a friend here who was paying a little bit more attention than myself. We're going to
[01:50.460 --> 01:54.980]  jump right in. We're going to read this message. This one came from our friend used to be cool
[01:54.980 --> 01:59.380]  and it politely says, I am only writing to say I think you made a mistake when discussing
[01:59.380 --> 02:04.460]  the Joe Biden pardoning people with federal convictions for simple possession and I do
[02:04.460 --> 02:08.260]  understand where I went wrong. We will get to that and thank you for gently correcting
[02:08.260 --> 02:13.140]  me. I'm not afraid to be gently corrected. I do always ask for questions, corrections,
[02:13.140 --> 02:17.120]  comments, concerns. Please do send those to me. Again, the email address is grow from
[02:17.120 --> 02:21.260]  your heart at hotmail.com. Let's get into this one. It says, I think you made a mistake.
[02:21.260 --> 02:25.660]  I watched Biden make the announcement, but I do not recall him saying anything about
[02:25.660 --> 02:30.900]  a release of prisoners, which is what I misunderstood and where I misspoke. It says his announcement
[02:30.900 --> 02:35.700]  was to say that he was pardoning people with federal convictions, convictions for possession.
[02:35.700 --> 02:40.340]  Now the result of any pardon would be to release anyone serving time, but as you pointed out
[02:40.340 --> 02:45.100]  and which Biden would have already been aware, no one was serving time for a simple possession.
[02:45.100 --> 02:50.220]  So that makes sense so far. It says a pardon acts to wipe out any conviction as if it never
[02:50.220 --> 02:55.140]  happened and that is what Mr. Biden has accomplished. So that is a little bit different. That does
[02:55.140 --> 02:59.340]  make a big difference. That does do some different things for a few people that may have affected
[02:59.340 --> 03:03.820]  more people. So we'll talk about that briefly. He does go on. He says, well, Mr. Biden may
[03:03.820 --> 03:08.780]  have been fishing for votes. He still did the right thing yet. I would urge you to correct
[03:08.780 --> 03:12.180]  the record and then he signs it with his cool name. Used to be cool. Big shout out to my
[03:12.180 --> 03:16.820]  buddy used to be cool. You guys, I appreciate these types of updates, these types of corrections.
[03:16.820 --> 03:20.740]  The only way I get stopped from saying crazy stuff on here is if somebody does correct
[03:20.740 --> 03:24.860]  me. So thank you for the correction and the update. Now let's talk about that real briefly
[03:24.860 --> 03:28.600]  here. I don't want to dwell on old news. I misspoke. I thought that nobody was going
[03:28.600 --> 03:32.180]  to get released from federal prison, which that is, that is accurate. What's going to
[03:32.180 --> 03:36.700]  happen is some people are going to be pardoned, which means their federal cannabis crimes
[03:36.700 --> 03:41.080]  will be wiped away, which will help people out. Why would this be beneficial to people?
[03:41.080 --> 03:45.040]  Because on a lot of job applications, it says, have you ever been convicted of a crime? And
[03:45.040 --> 03:48.880]  now if you don't have a federal cannabis crime on your record, you're probably open to a
[03:48.880 --> 03:54.440]  lot more job opportunity. You're probably also open to a lot more educational opportunities.
[03:54.440 --> 03:58.360]  When you apply for colleges, it says, do you have any drug crimes right there? You go,
[03:58.400 --> 04:01.920]  Hey, I got a federal cannabis crime. Guess what? No job for you. Guess what? They deleted
[04:01.920 --> 04:06.840]  that more opportunity for also this could give people the opportunity for more loans.
[04:06.840 --> 04:10.420]  More people will be able to start their own business. So the main thing that this did
[04:10.420 --> 04:14.960]  is it wiped a, a dent off of a lot of people's record. A lot of people got a fresh start.
[04:14.960 --> 04:18.920]  We erase some junk, some, uh, some cannabis crimes that will help people out that will
[04:18.920 --> 04:23.680]  give people more opportunity was, which is what the world, especially the States need
[04:23.680 --> 04:28.720]  right now. We need more opportunity. So the bottom line is more opportunity. People will
[04:28.720 --> 04:31.780]  be able to get more jobs. They'll be able to get more loans. They'll be able to go to
[04:31.780 --> 04:35.960]  more schooling. They'll be able to better themselves and make a better future for themselves
[04:35.960 --> 04:41.960]  and not be, uh, stopped or blocked or have a hurdle of a federal cannabis crime in the
[04:41.960 --> 04:45.760]  way. So my friend used to be cool. Thank you for the great update, my dude. Uh, thank you
[04:45.760 --> 04:50.160]  for keeping me on my toes and keeping me straight. I do appreciate it. You guys, like I said
[04:50.160 --> 04:53.680]  before, don't be shy. If you hear me say something silly, something you don't agree
[04:53.680 --> 04:57.520]  with, send me a message. Sometimes Jesse will send me a text message. He'll be like, Hey,
[04:57.520 --> 05:02.600]  bro, you should have said 1212. You said 24 or 18, six or 19, five or some shit. And I
[05:02.600 --> 05:06.440]  try to correct it and come on and say, Hey, I messed that up. You guys pay attention.
[05:06.440 --> 05:10.600]  Keep me on my toes. I do appreciate it. I'm no wizard. I'm no guru. I just have a show
[05:10.600 --> 05:15.400]  and sometimes I will make some mistakes. Thanks for keeping me on my toes. All right. I've
[05:15.400 --> 05:18.880]  been rambling enough about that. Um, I do want to keep talking about some things before
[05:18.880 --> 05:23.200]  we jump into the main topic of today's podcast. I do want to announce that, uh, the blueberry
[05:23.200 --> 05:27.040]  butcher seeds will be back on. I redirect for Halloween. That is right. Blueberry butcher
[05:27.040 --> 05:31.800]  seeds, then packaging them up, getting them ready. Halloween. They will be on the website
[05:31.800 --> 05:36.080]  at irie direct.com. Anybody that gets a pack of blueberry butcher seeds while supplies
[05:36.080 --> 05:40.760]  last, they will come with a free pack of platinum Tangy cross to the Jack, the ripper. Here's
[05:40.760 --> 05:45.440]  the catch you guys. I need help naming the platinum Tangy to Jack, the ripper cross.
[05:45.440 --> 05:49.160]  What is a cool name for that? I need a cool name. You guys always have the greatest input,
[05:49.160 --> 05:53.800]  the greatest feedback and advice I want to see in the comment section. What do we call
[05:53.800 --> 05:58.200]  platinum Tangy? It's a platinum Tangy female to a Jack, the ripper male. It's got that
[05:58.200 --> 06:03.440]  Tangy candy goodness. It's got some spicy dryer sheet sort of aromas to it. Uh, lots
[06:03.440 --> 06:08.240]  of lemon Tangy aromas and a really ripping soaring head high. So help me out with the
[06:08.240 --> 06:13.840]  name to that. Uh, platinum Tangy female pollinated by a Jack, the ripper male needs a cool name.
[06:13.840 --> 06:18.640]  All right. Where do we go from there? Oh, also everything on I redirect does get free
[06:18.640 --> 06:22.600]  packs with every order. All right, that's enough advertising here. Let's jump into the
[06:22.600 --> 06:27.120]  main topic. I do have a great email that came from our friend. I'm not sure if he wants
[06:27.120 --> 06:31.840]  his name said or not, or they want their name said or not. We've got to be careful. Uh,
[06:31.840 --> 06:34.240]  but let's jump right into this email. It's right here in front of me. There's no need
[06:34.240 --> 06:38.800]  to stare at it. Let's read it to the kind people. This message goes a little bit like
[06:38.800 --> 06:43.680]  this. It says, yo, what's up? Rasta Jeff. I'm just about to listen to episode five 90
[06:43.680 --> 06:48.080]  and I'm super interested in testing of your seeds. Yes. A lot of people are interested
[06:48.080 --> 06:52.240]  in testing seeds. There are a lot of new things ready to be tested. People are contacting
[06:52.240 --> 06:56.760]  me. If you've watched the tester episode, watch that before you reach out. Another requirement
[06:56.760 --> 07:00.320]  will be that you do join the discord. If you were on the discord, you've got a much greater
[07:00.320 --> 07:05.680]  chance of being qualified, accepted and approved as a tester because I have everybody posting
[07:05.680 --> 07:09.840]  their tester logs on the discord. That way I can just go to one spot. I can go discord
[07:09.840 --> 07:13.640]  tester tab, scroll through and see what everybody's doing. That's how I start my morning. So I
[07:13.640 --> 07:17.240]  do some morning chores and I sit there in my morning smoke is scrolling the testers.
[07:17.240 --> 07:20.760]  That's usually what I do. Anyway, go watch the episode. Let me know what you think. If
[07:20.760 --> 07:24.040]  you still want to be a tester, join the discord. We'd love to see you there. There should be
[07:24.040 --> 07:27.800]  a link in the show notes and the video description. It goes on. It says, I'll get back to you
[07:27.800 --> 07:31.960]  on that. After I listen, I'm in NorCal in Shasta County and I grow for myself. All right,
[07:31.960 --> 07:36.280]  we don't need to read all that. It says my main question right now is I see that ethos
[07:36.280 --> 07:41.000]  genetics has a seed pack called Colin OG. Yes, they do. Big shout out to our friends
[07:41.080 --> 07:46.120]  at ethos genetics. Big up to my buddy, Colin, the head motherfucker in charge over there
[07:46.120 --> 07:51.960]  at ethos seeds. They do have a strain. It goes on. It says, I see ethos genetics has
[07:51.960 --> 07:56.600]  a seed pack called Colin OG. They do have a strain called Colin OG. Of course, all of
[07:56.600 --> 08:00.600]  us breeders name a strain after ourselves. We got the lemon Jeffrey for me. There's a
[08:00.600 --> 08:04.440]  Jeff's OG that was really rare. Maybe we'll remake some more of those. But yes, there
[08:04.440 --> 08:09.400]  is a Colin OG that is made by the ethos collective. We'll talk a little bit about that. It says
[08:10.200 --> 08:16.120]  it's got grateful dog in it from IRI genetics. Yes, it absolutely does. It says, I'm curious,
[08:16.120 --> 08:21.720]  was this a collab on your part or did he just buy a pack of your seeds? It's much deeper
[08:21.720 --> 08:25.560]  than both of those, bro. You're going to love this story. This is going to be fun. It says,
[08:25.560 --> 08:30.760]  I'm curious, oh, where were we? Did he buy a pack of seeds? Then did the breeding work,
[08:30.760 --> 08:34.840]  made his packs and is giving you credit after the fact. He wraps it up. He says, thanks,
[08:34.840 --> 08:39.560]  man. I love the podcast and everything you do for the community. Thanks, much love and respect
[08:39.560 --> 08:44.360]  your way from Lucas. Big shout out to our friend, Lucas. I hope it's okay that I said your name on
[08:44.360 --> 08:51.240]  the show because too late, I'm not going to edit that shit out. The first question is, did he just
[08:51.240 --> 08:57.240]  buy a pack of your seeds? Let's see. Was this a collab on your part or did he just buy a pack
[08:57.240 --> 09:01.160]  of your seeds? That's a really good question. Let me talk about the grateful dog. Let me unpack this
[09:01.160 --> 09:07.320]  a little bit more. The grateful dog. I made the grateful dog from a ... I got a pack of ... A lot
[09:07.320 --> 09:11.000]  of people may not know this story. A lot of people are gathering around and turning up their AirPods
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.520]  to hear this one because people have been requesting and asking for this episode. I'm
[09:14.520 --> 09:17.960]  kind of excited to deliver this story right now. This is going to be really cool. Here we go.
[09:17.960 --> 09:24.920]  Grateful dog. I bought a bunch of seeds. Within that bunch of seeds, I got a pack of seeds called
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.960]  Deadhead OG from the Cali Connection. Yes, controversial company. Feel what you will,
[09:29.960 --> 09:34.840]  think what you may. That's where the seeds came from. The opinions and feedback don't matter
[09:34.840 --> 09:38.360]  right now. That's straight up history. That's what happened. I'm not going to change anything.
[09:38.360 --> 09:42.600]  It's a pack of Deadhead OG from the Cali Connection. I grew those out. There were several
[09:42.600 --> 09:46.680]  phenotypes that were fire. There were a couple of phenotypes that were not fire in my opinion,
[09:46.680 --> 09:52.440]  but a couple of them were hot fucking fire. Number nine was my favorite phenotype out of that batch,
[09:52.440 --> 09:58.120]  out of the population, number nine was the best looking plant in my opinion. It had a gassy
[09:58.680 --> 10:03.480]  um a funky gassy thing that when you smelled it your eyes kind of squinted like what is that but
[10:03.480 --> 10:09.400]  then it also had a earthy musky thing that you went oh I want some of that but then after then
[10:09.400 --> 10:14.680]  I dried it and cured it and smoked it and it had musky gassy skunky funk but then when you
[10:14.680 --> 10:19.000]  exhaled it a couple seconds later a berry thing would hit your tongue you'd be like well now
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.560]  there's fucking melons and berries in there it's like it was really confusing complex delicious
[10:23.560 --> 10:30.120]  weed so that was number nine that was Deadhead OG number nine is what that was so I took Deadhead OG
[10:30.120 --> 10:35.480]  number nine I took two clones of that plant because you need two clones to do what I'm about to do
[10:35.480 --> 10:41.480]  I put silver thiosulfate on one and reversed it that made pollen that was all female pollen I put
[10:41.480 --> 10:47.720]  that female pollen on the other clone it is they're both number nine it is Deadhead OG number nine
[10:47.720 --> 10:52.680]  the seeds that came from there I selected one out of that one and I started calling that one
[10:52.680 --> 10:58.200]  Grateful Dog then I grew a bunch of those my favorite keeper out of that I called it Grateful
[10:58.200 --> 11:03.720]  Dog it was Deadhead OG but I had selfed it and made my own out of that that one became Grateful
[11:03.720 --> 11:09.400]  Dog we later took do I even want to tell this part once again I took that original pollen and put it
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.360]  on my Grateful Dog and made another one that I called 77 if you're a Grateful Dead fan maybe I've
[11:14.360 --> 11:20.040]  talked about this before 77 is just one of my favorite years of the Grateful Dead 72 77 that
[11:20.040 --> 11:28.040]  era but 77 is awesome and since I had Deadhead OG I made Grateful Dog and then I made 77 from that
[11:28.040 --> 11:32.520]  77 never got released that one's mine I play with that you guys can't have it but that is how
[11:32.520 --> 11:38.200]  Grateful Dog got made it was a Deadhead OG reversed I selfed it and then it's one of the it's an S1
[11:38.200 --> 11:43.560]  it's one of the selfed from the Deadhead OG so that is where that came from then I was here's
[11:43.560 --> 11:46.520]  where the story gets fun I'm checking my notes to make sure I'm staying on track here because I'm
[11:46.520 --> 11:51.800]  high and I get rambling big shout out to our friends for the Lemon Jeffrey concentrates so I
[11:51.800 --> 11:56.840]  make Grateful Dog right I grow a bunch of seeds out I find one that's a champ I keep this one champ
[11:56.840 --> 12:02.520]  I'm growing it I'm smoking it everywhere I go in town anytime I open up my bag or pack a bowl or
[12:02.520 --> 12:06.360]  roll a joint or light a bowl people go bro what kind of weed is that it was getting a lot of
[12:06.360 --> 12:11.480]  attention that shit was fire in my opinion on a lot of other people's opinion that was top quality
[12:11.480 --> 12:16.920]  cannabis some of the best herb I ever bred and or grew and or smoked so it was one of my favorites
[12:16.920 --> 12:20.760]  that's why you people hear about it that's why it's uh always sought after that's why it's a
[12:20.760 --> 12:26.920]  legend so I went to go see a concert at Red Rocks I believe I was at either Reggae on the Rocks
[12:26.920 --> 12:31.080]  I believe it was a Reggae on the Rocks and Revolution was the headlining act I was way
[12:31.080 --> 12:35.720]  into Revolution at the time I ended up going to this concert by myself the person that was supposed
[12:35.720 --> 12:40.040]  to go with me backed out they weren't able to make it I went to Reggae on the Rocks by myself
[12:40.040 --> 12:44.440]  not a big deal I love a concert by myself I there's going to be 9,000 other people there to
[12:44.440 --> 12:48.520]  make friends with it's cool I'm gonna have a good time don't worry so we go to the concert I go to
[12:48.520 --> 12:53.960]  the concert and anytime I go to a concert I roll up a lot of joints back in the day they used to
[12:53.960 --> 12:57.640]  be more strict about letting you take weed into concerts I'm in Colorado now they don't really
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.440]  care very much but back in the day they used to be more uh more they would scrutinize you more for
[13:02.440 --> 13:06.600]  having your weed they would pat you down search you take your shit so my theory was I'd put three
[13:06.600 --> 13:10.760]  joints in this pocket three joints in this pocket three joints here three joints here and I would
[13:10.760 --> 13:14.600]  just be a walking joint dispenser that way if they found these three they'd go I got your weed and
[13:14.600 --> 13:18.600]  they'd quit and I'd still have 30 more joints tucked away somewhere in my clothing that I could
[13:18.600 --> 13:23.640]  get into that concert so I took a bunch of joints in there and there are several bands ahead of
[13:23.640 --> 13:27.800]  Revolution so we're smoking and just hanging out dancing to the music I'm by myself just getting
[13:27.800 --> 13:33.400]  down I kept a joint burning the entire time like I just did not put out a joint I got there I got
[13:33.400 --> 13:38.280]  my space I decided here's where I'm standing lit up a joint started smoking it as soon as that joint
[13:38.280 --> 13:42.040]  went out it flicked the roach light up another one I had plenty I was by myself I was not going
[13:42.040 --> 13:46.920]  to run out of weed I knew that I noticed that this kid next to me this this dude next to me about my
[13:46.920 --> 13:51.480]  age he looked cool um he was smoking weed too and I noticed every time I would light a joint
[13:51.480 --> 13:55.800]  he would look over like damn that smells good and he would light his own joint and I would smell his
[13:55.800 --> 14:00.440]  weed and go nah mine's better and if it was better I would have shared with him if he had good weed
[14:00.440 --> 14:03.560]  that enticed me I would have been like can I hit your weed you can hit my weed we would have to
[14:03.560 --> 14:07.240]  talk but I was like I got the good weed I'm gonna stay over here and I just hung out by myself
[14:07.880 --> 14:13.000]  uh eventually after a few joints and me lighting up a joint that dude lighting a joint me lighting
[14:13.000 --> 14:16.760]  another and he lighting another and all of my stuff smelled better than his every time it was
[14:16.760 --> 14:20.680]  just the Grateful Dog is all I was smoking eventually he leans over and he goes man you
[14:20.680 --> 14:26.520]  got some really good weed and I was like oh thank you bro and he asks what is that and I told him
[14:26.520 --> 14:31.160]  it's called the Grateful Dog and he goes I've never heard of that and I told him I bred it
[14:31.160 --> 14:38.040]  and now this is like this was Colorado around probably 2008 2009 maybe 2010 ish I could check
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.760]  and find the exact date uh but I know when this happened and I know the timeline around that time
[14:42.760 --> 14:48.680]  this happened and around that time everybody in Colorado every white guy with dreadlocks was a new
[14:48.680 --> 14:54.280]  seed breeder had some new hash company hadn't a new dispensary or something so when I was like I
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.520]  bred this he was just kind of like he was a little bit skeptical and he's like well where can I get
[14:58.520 --> 15:03.480]  a cut of that and I was like oh man I don't really want to sell a cut and then he introduced himself
[15:03.480 --> 15:07.400]  and he was like well my name is this uh should I say his name his name is Noah fuck it this is
[15:07.400 --> 15:12.840]  history bro we got to get the history right so my buddy Noah said uh my name is Noah and I am the
[15:12.840 --> 15:19.000]  owner of Mile High Green Cross and at the time so this was around the same year that uh Mile High
[15:19.000 --> 15:24.600]  Green Cross won first place in the Denver High Times Cannabis Cup for their banana kush or banana
[15:24.600 --> 15:31.400]  OG so if you want to reference that date when Mile High Green Cross won the Denver Cannabis Cup for
[15:31.400 --> 15:36.040]  their banana kush or banana OG it's banana that's all I needed to remember that's the same year that
[15:36.040 --> 15:41.160]  this story happened and Revolution was at Red Rocks that year as well that's the year that this story
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.840]  took place so my boy Noah says I own Mile High Green Cross and I've been smoking banana kush and
[15:46.840 --> 15:51.080]  it smells good and it won the Cannabis Cup and I was like nice and then he's like I'd be willing
[15:51.080 --> 15:56.440]  to give you this much money for a cut of that plant and I'd been thinking that if anybody wanted
[15:56.440 --> 16:01.320]  a cut of that plant that was the number that I wanted he told me the number that I had in mind
[16:01.320 --> 16:06.760]  and I said that's a really good acceptable deal bro and I was like I live here it's about two and
[16:06.760 --> 16:11.880]  a half hours from where we are right now uh here's my phone number I will cut the clones for you as
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.520]  soon as I get home from this adventure seeing reggae and then in about two weeks give me a call
[16:16.760 --> 16:21.240]  to my house and we'll fucking I'll give you this clone for the money that you offered and so
[16:21.960 --> 16:27.960]  basically that's how Noah um acquired that clone so he followed through he called me until I came
[16:27.960 --> 16:32.360]  home I cut the clones two and a half ish weeks later he came down and picked up his clones of
[16:32.360 --> 16:37.240]  Grateful Dog when he came down he also brought me other clones he brought other stuff that's where
[16:37.240 --> 16:43.960]  I got the um the action Bronson cut that is uh Silver Chem uh Chem D to Super Silver Haze I'm
[16:43.960 --> 16:48.200]  not sure which order that's in but that's where I got the action Bronson cut which made a couple
[16:48.200 --> 16:52.760]  of great crosses some of my a couple of really great plants actually came the Helz OG actually
[16:52.760 --> 16:56.680]  came from our friend Noah he would just trade me and bring me a lot of stuff we established a pretty
[16:56.680 --> 17:02.040]  cool relationship let me give Noah a big shout out I knew that when I was giving Noah clones
[17:02.040 --> 17:06.760]  that my clone technique sucked I cut a bunch of clones of Grateful Dog hoping to get a couple of
[17:06.760 --> 17:11.080]  solid cuts to give to him I wanted them to root and so that he could have something fancy when
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.800]  he got here to get him he looked disappointed in my clones and to be honest I was my clone skill
[17:15.800 --> 17:20.280]  was lacking at the time I wasn't where I am now which I'm not sad to admit I'm not afraid to admit
[17:20.280 --> 17:24.280]  you got to start somewhere you got to learn everything my clones really sucked at this time
[17:24.280 --> 17:27.800]  so he's like bro what you need is an easy clone and I was like an easy clone and he's like the
[17:27.800 --> 17:32.040]  clone machine I was like oh tell me about it so he showed me pictures and videos I was like I need
[17:32.040 --> 17:37.000]  one of those and then he wanted a bunch of cuts from me some stuff that I wasn't really excited
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.880]  to let go of you know what I mean like sometimes you have clones you don't want to get rid of some
[17:39.880 --> 17:44.520]  I'll share some I'm you can't have he's like I want a couple of these and I was like ah and then
[17:44.520 --> 17:50.920]  I said he made an offer one of us made an offer he offered to trade me an easy cloner machine for a
[17:50.920 --> 17:55.640]  couple of cuts so what we did was he bought an easy cloner and brought it to my place where I
[17:55.640 --> 18:00.760]  was growing we went into my mother room we cut clones and filled up the easy clone machine he
[18:00.760 --> 18:05.000]  showed me how to get it running get it dialed in get it ph'd and set up how to cut the clones how
[18:05.000 --> 18:10.280]  to put them in there then about 10 days later he got to come back and pick up the clones of choice
[18:10.280 --> 18:14.840]  out of the cloner that's how he got paid I traded him those cuts for the easy cloner and the
[18:14.840 --> 18:19.960]  knowledge so that's how my clone game got uh springboarded got leaps and bounds of improvement
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.280]  was from my friend Noah from Mile High Green Cross if you hear this bro fist bump big up I hope you're
[18:24.280 --> 18:29.000]  well wherever you are we've kind of lost touch uh he had a child I don't think he's in the cannabis
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.520]  industry anymore he's kind of doing his own thing we kind of don't keep in touch anymore
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.080]  I'm doing my thing he's doing his he'll come around we never lose touch for forever that's
[18:37.080 --> 18:42.920]  how this industry works anyway so my buddy gets the cut we we meet each other at Red Rocks he
[18:42.920 --> 18:47.000]  comes to my place he gets the cut we develop a relationship he teaches me how to fill the easy
[18:47.000 --> 18:53.400]  cloner now he's got his uh grateful dog clone that he takes into a commercial facility he acquires a
[18:53.400 --> 18:57.880]  commercial grow in that grow he had a lot of my stuff he had a lot of my plants in there
[18:57.880 --> 19:01.240]  uh I would give him seed packs and let him run the seeds in there and then he would bring me back
[19:01.240 --> 19:05.800]  the keepers we had a pretty cool setup so Noah's got my clone of grateful dog he's running it in
[19:05.800 --> 19:11.240]  his commercial facility eventually Noah decides he doesn't want that commercial facility anymore
[19:11.240 --> 19:15.640]  this just happens the rules change the laws change so much that a lot of people that were in it for
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.960]  the passion for the heart uh we couldn't come up with the million dollars that we needed for some
[19:19.960 --> 19:24.760]  of the new rule changes so instead of doing that a lot of people just sold out uh sold their business
[19:24.760 --> 19:28.040]  got some money and got out of the business because it went to corporate they pushed out all the
[19:28.040 --> 19:33.000]  people with heart and they gave it to all the people with suits and no knowledge and that's why
[19:33.000 --> 19:36.680]  uh that's why it's all commercial corporate crappy weed now in the dispensaries because
[19:36.680 --> 19:40.600]  the people that care about it we want to do a good job but the people in the suits they want
[19:40.600 --> 19:45.720]  money coming in yesterday and that kind of messes it up so my buddy Noah gets out of the industry
[19:45.720 --> 19:52.120]  and he sells his grow to a guy by the name of Colin. Colin is the owner of Ethos Collective or
[19:52.600 --> 19:59.400]  Ethos Seeds that is how Colin acquired my Grateful Dog Cut so at that point he's got full access it's
[19:59.400 --> 20:05.000]  his it's in that grow facility that's his plant he can do whatever he wants with it anybody can
[20:05.000 --> 20:10.040]  breed with my seeds if you've got my beans you're allowed to breed with them if you've got a clone
[20:10.040 --> 20:14.840]  that came from me you're allowed to breed with that I did not invent cannabis I didn't just
[20:14.840 --> 20:19.400]  cough or fart or sneeze or meditate one day or pull them out of my dreadlocks I did not make
[20:19.400 --> 20:24.520]  seeds out of thin air I had to use seeds and or clones they came from guess what other breeders
[20:24.520 --> 20:29.320]  they had to come from somewhere nobody invented cannabis we're all using other people's creations
[20:29.320 --> 20:33.960]  other people's platforms other people's what is it foundation we're all using other people's seeds
[20:33.960 --> 20:39.560]  and clones so I feel no uh territorial or no whatever it is breed with my seeds I just want
[20:39.560 --> 20:44.200]  credit if there's one of my plants in there and you list it on the package give me some credit
[20:44.200 --> 20:49.320]  maybe send me a pack of seeds don't change names don't be shady if you do everything ethically and
[20:49.400 --> 20:53.640]  cool it may be beneficial for you to say that there is one of my crosses in there that makes
[20:53.640 --> 20:59.080]  things desirable when you put something good in it people want that shit so uh Colin acquires my
[20:59.080 --> 21:03.080]  grateful dog through the purchase of Noah's commercial facility now he's got it at this
[21:03.080 --> 21:08.920]  point he can do whatever he wants with it which is where he bred it and he created his own Colin OG
[21:08.920 --> 21:13.160]  pretty sure that's grateful dog sour diesel and the white I could be wrong there could be more
[21:13.160 --> 21:17.160]  there's flow in there somewhere I do believe I should have googled that but that is Colin's
[21:17.160 --> 21:22.120]  creation that's Colin OG yes there absolutely is some grateful dog in there and then let's
[21:22.120 --> 21:25.560]  address that second part of the question I kind of touched on it just a little bit here
[21:26.200 --> 21:30.920]  did he buy I'm curious was this a collab it wasn't really a collab and he did not buy seeds he got
[21:30.920 --> 21:35.800]  the clone and then he did do the breeding work and yes he is making packs and giving me credit
[21:35.800 --> 21:40.680]  after the fact which is very uh admirable and respectful of that guy to give me credit
[21:40.760 --> 21:49.400]  after the fact now um the part about is this a collab technically uh no but untechnically yeah
[21:49.400 --> 21:55.080]  we're all collabing anybody that I have put their pollen and my seeds or their seeds in my pollen or
[21:55.080 --> 21:59.480]  my plants and their pollen together we're technically collabing it's not always an approved
[21:59.480 --> 22:05.000]  or an endorsed or signed or whatever planned out collab for both of us but yeah anybody that all
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.640]  you guys out there if you use one of my plants a female or a male and you breed it to something
[22:09.640 --> 22:14.120]  technically basically I guess you can say we collabed I can't deny it because my pollen is in
[22:14.120 --> 22:21.000]  your plants so yeah technically we did collab but untechnically no it wasn't like a uh a planned
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.960]  thought out collab he just did his thing um and I can't be mad about it I breed with a lot of his
[22:25.960 --> 22:31.320]  stuff the uh lemon what is it the lemon OG haze that I worked with that came from Colin and I
[22:31.320 --> 22:36.120]  made the sonic boom out of that one so can't be mad about him working with my stuff I'm doing it
[22:36.120 --> 22:40.120]  too big up Colin hope you're well if you ever hear this bro hope you're well I'm pretty sure
[22:40.120 --> 22:44.440]  he's learning to play piano pretty well I can play some drums a little bit let's do some uh
[22:44.440 --> 22:49.560]  some funky jazz piano drum sort of stuff together one day that should be fun all right I feel like
[22:49.560 --> 22:55.080]  I'm rambling let me check my notes and get myself back on track um yeah I think I covered the main
[22:55.080 --> 23:00.280]  uh portions of this email we're all collabing you guys um there are other collabs when I do call
[23:00.280 --> 23:04.680]  breeders and I say hey do you want to do this or we talk about it and we do plan projects but most
[23:04.680 --> 23:09.080]  of the time uh it's just me selecting stuff it's really fun when you talk to I can't tell you who
[23:09.080 --> 23:13.000]  I'm trying to work with right now but there's one breeder and I'm like yeah I want to use this and
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.960]  they're like let me find the perfect pheno what are you going to use and I'm like this and we're
[23:15.960 --> 23:19.160]  kind of planning it out they're going to select one end I'm going to select the other we're going
[23:19.160 --> 23:22.360]  to breed that shit together it's going to be stellar can't tell you too much about it there
[23:22.360 --> 23:27.560]  are a couple of those in the works um that's all I think I should talk about for this episode because
[23:27.560 --> 23:32.200]  I have said a whole lot of stuff I talked about the grateful dog I made a correction I feel like
[23:32.200 --> 23:36.760]  if we just leave this episode just grateful dog it'll be a good standalone topic on its own so
[23:36.760 --> 23:41.800]  ladies gentlemen boys girls pimps hoes friends foes smokers growers clone cutters pollen chuckers
