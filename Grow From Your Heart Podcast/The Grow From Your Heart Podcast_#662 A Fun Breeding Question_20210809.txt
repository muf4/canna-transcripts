[01:57.420 --> 01:59.580]  All right, I do have a lot of great stuff to talk about
[02:00.140 --> 02:03.260]  I'm coming to you on a rainy cold
[02:03.740 --> 02:08.260]  Colorado evening. I'm a little bit excited to be cold. I had to turn off the air conditioner
[02:08.460 --> 02:10.020]  My arms are a little cold
[02:10.020 --> 02:14.460]  It's kind of poking a hole in my shirt over here and I am so excited to be cold
[02:14.460 --> 02:18.700]  It has been a long hot summer. I am really excited for the cold
[02:18.700 --> 02:25.460]  However, it is now what I call powdery mildew season. We have gone from super hot to super cold
[02:26.140 --> 02:27.660]  sometimes it is
[02:27.660 --> 02:32.100]  60-something at night and 90-something during the day. We're having some jumps
[02:32.100 --> 02:38.660]  We're heading into the fall time of year here almost a couple of weird temperature swings in Colorado
[02:38.780 --> 02:42.500]  We will get some rain. We'll get some hailstorms. We'll have some 90 degree days
[02:42.700 --> 02:48.300]  That is the perfect environment for powdery mildew. Do you have a strategy? Do you have a plan?
[02:48.300 --> 02:53.740]  Have you thought about what you're going to do when you see the powdery mildew? Are you looking for it?
[02:53.740 --> 02:58.380]  Are you scouting for powdery mildew? I'm mainly talking about outdoors, but this will apply indoors as well
[02:58.380 --> 03:02.380]  Are you looking for powdery mildew outdoors? Do you know how to identify it?
[03:02.380 --> 03:06.580]  Do all of the people working in your grow know how to identify powdery mildew?
[03:06.580 --> 03:08.980]  Do you know what to do if it is spotted in your grow?
[03:09.340 --> 03:14.460]  Because outdoors it is now powdery mildew season in the grow houses have a strategy in place
[03:14.840 --> 03:20.900]  Be ready on know what products you are willing to use know what willing products it is too late to use know our products
[03:20.900 --> 03:24.700]  You can use together get a strategy in place now is
[03:25.220 --> 03:26.540]  Late time. All right
[03:26.540 --> 03:28.420]  I did say I was gonna talk about that dog
[03:28.420 --> 03:33.860]  But again talking about the dog, but the chem dog and chem dog and the sour diesel
[03:34.340 --> 03:39.660]  Resulted in several emails. I'm sure they will keep going. They'll keep coming as more people listen to the episode
[03:39.980 --> 03:42.540]  But I do have a great one here in front of me. I want to talk about
[03:43.220 --> 03:50.020]  This one came from patreon patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. It says hey Rasta Jeff. Thank you for replying
[03:50.300 --> 03:55.300]  And then it says I guess it's hard to put this into words, but I will try you do a wonderful job my friend
[03:55.300 --> 04:02.900]  I've read this message. It says I guess the background is that I learned to self-medicate in the early 90s. Welcome to the crew, bro
[04:03.620 --> 04:05.340]  Growing up. I was a smart kid
[04:05.340 --> 04:10.540]  It was called lazy by teachers and family for years because I wasn't trying or applying myself, bro
[04:10.540 --> 04:14.100]  Me too. I was just bored with the freakin curriculum teach me some shit
[04:14.100 --> 04:19.380]  I care about and I am passionate keep teaching me about the same shit over and over again in school and I already learned it
[04:19.380 --> 04:23.020]  I don't care I get obnoxious. I know what you mean. It says as a young adult
[04:23.900 --> 04:27.860]  Experimenting I found that I could focus and be successful with the help of cannabis
[04:28.540 --> 04:33.940]  Rastafari, I know exactly what you mean brother. Sometimes I wake up. My thoughts are going seven different directions
[04:33.940 --> 04:37.620]  I don't know what needs to get done today. I don't know what I want to eat for breakfast
[04:37.620 --> 04:38.980]  I don't know what shoes I'm gonna wear today
[04:38.980 --> 04:42.620]  I take a couple of dabs and everything just goes you want to have this for breakfast
[04:42.620 --> 04:47.060]  You're gonna wear these shoes and then at 9 o'clock you have to go to this place and it all just falls right into place
[04:47.100 --> 04:50.780]  Just smoke a little bit and the the pieces of the puzzle kind of come back together
[04:50.780 --> 04:52.780]  So I know what you mean my friend
[04:53.340 --> 04:56.140]  Now I am the head of I don't know if I should read this part
[04:56.140 --> 04:58.940]  We're gonna read leave some of this out because it may reveal too much of who you are
[04:58.940 --> 05:04.260]  And if anybody from work reads this anyway, our friend is the head of a global company
[05:04.260 --> 05:09.680]  We're gonna leave out some details there. So they are very successful. They're a cannabis consumer. They've been smoking since the 90s
[05:09.680 --> 05:12.520]  They're probably close to my age and they are successful
[05:12.520 --> 05:19.320]  so this states first of all that people can smoke cannabis and they can self medicate with it and they can become very
[05:19.560 --> 05:26.560]  Very successful people and we shouldn't judge anybody for the way they choose to medicate themselves. I am rambling it says now
[05:27.560 --> 05:31.160]  Chem dog was not only the guy to find the seeds at that time
[05:31.720 --> 05:37.480]  Okay, chem dog was not the only guy to find seeds at that time with the Grateful Dead and fish tours
[05:37.640 --> 05:43.320]  So it sounds like my friend here may have stumbled across some of those chem dog seeds or those dog bud seeds
[05:43.840 --> 05:45.840]  We found plenty and many
[05:46.320 --> 05:49.920]  Northern Vermont and northern New York people grew it, too
[05:50.280 --> 05:50.780]  Yeah
[05:50.780 --> 05:54.480]  It's not unlikely if somebody found if one person found 13 seeds in an ounce
[05:54.760 --> 05:59.520]  And the weed was going around Grateful Dead shows and fish shows there was more of that herb going around
[05:59.920 --> 06:02.260]  Not just that one ounce had seeds in it
[06:02.260 --> 06:07.320]  Which is funny because the guys that were selling it were hoping to find seeds and they never did to the best of my knowledge
[06:07.320 --> 06:11.920]  But it sounds like they were in a couple of eights. Some of the custies got some of those seeds
[06:12.600 --> 06:19.360]  So people in Vermont and New York were growing it too big up to the New York and Vermont fish family
[06:19.720 --> 06:23.440]  Cannot wait to boogie down in a couple of weeks if all things go well
[06:24.280 --> 06:30.480]  Now that I tried different chem dogs or chem 91 crosses. I realize how much a growers style
[06:30.920 --> 06:34.480]  Personality and talent play a part. Yes, that's absolutely accurate
[06:34.480 --> 06:39.920]  I always say that if I give 10 people a clone of the same exact plant
[06:39.920 --> 06:44.760]  We're going to get 10 different finished products. They're gonna grow it differently. Their room is differently
[06:44.760 --> 06:47.640]  The environment is different. Their nutrients are different
[06:47.920 --> 06:54.440]  Their pruning their technique will be a little bit different then of course the dry and cure process is going to be drastically different
[06:54.440 --> 06:58.320]  So we're gonna get some similar familiar aromas flavors
[06:58.320 --> 07:02.320]  The buzz will be similar but there will be subtle differences amongst every grow
[07:02.600 --> 07:06.160]  Maybe some of the buds will be more dense. Maybe some of the buds will be fluffier
[07:06.600 --> 07:13.520]  Maybe some if the aromas lean certain ways like with the chem 91 we get some sweetness and some foot and then some just weird
[07:13.520 --> 07:17.760]  Funk, maybe some guys are gonna bring out more foot. Some guys are gonna bring out more funk
[07:17.760 --> 07:22.520]  Some guys are gonna bring out the sweetness that has a lot to do with the nutrients the environment
[07:22.520 --> 07:27.800]  And then of course the drying and curing process are going to play a huge role in the finished product
[07:27.800 --> 07:35.280]  So it's a lot like a song if if you get 10 bands that are all professional bands and they play the same
[07:35.560 --> 07:41.720]  Song it's gonna sound a little bit different. They'll play the same notes, but it's gonna have a little bit different flavor to it
[07:41.840 --> 07:47.160]  I'm trying to think of two bands we could compare that are gonna be anywhere near fair that people may I'm
[07:48.040 --> 07:53.560]  All right. Let's just say if we took Metallica and then we took a reggae band and we did the weight
[07:53.560 --> 07:57.520]  You know take a load off any right? You're gonna hear it. You can take a load off
[07:57.520 --> 08:02.040]  And it's gonna be screaming with Metallica is gonna do yeah, and then in the reggae it's gonna be boom
[08:02.600 --> 08:05.800]  Take a load. It's gonna be real slow. It's the same song
[08:05.800 --> 08:12.440]  It's gonna be the same song played correctly, but done with different flavors and different styles because it is very artist dependent
[08:12.440 --> 08:19.120]  I hope you followed along with that. We just compared Metallica and reggae to cannabis growing on this podcast
[08:19.120 --> 08:20.880]  You never know what we're gonna do next
[08:20.880 --> 08:25.440]  So, yes, it does play a big part then it goes on there is more to this wonderful message
[08:25.440 --> 08:28.480]  It says since what I'm looking for is not realistic
[08:28.480 --> 08:34.800]  I was hoping you would have a strain in your repertoire that might be inspired by the mid 90s fish scene
[08:34.800 --> 08:37.880]  But with a Rasta Jeff twist, um
[08:39.280 --> 08:43.160]  Man, you could probably find some of that if you are from the Vermont New York area
[08:43.520 --> 08:46.600]  Somebody's probably got some of those dog blood seeds that you were looking for
[08:46.600 --> 08:51.800]  But you're looking for something from the Rasta Jeff repertoire the IRI genetics catalog
[08:52.000 --> 08:57.360]  That is chem 91 with a Rasta Jeff twist you are in luck my friend
[08:57.360 --> 08:59.080]  I have a couple of things I would recommend for you
[08:59.080 --> 09:05.640]  The first one I'm going to suggest will be the morning dew morning dew is a cross of the grateful dog to my arise
[09:05.880 --> 09:12.360]  There's going to be a lot of chem in there. The grateful dog is chem D to or it's chem 91
[09:12.480 --> 09:17.920]  Apologize chem 91 to SF V og it is a deadhead og
[09:18.400 --> 09:21.800]  Kind of a feminized bat crossed inbreeding project
[09:21.800 --> 09:26.640]  I wasn't sure what I was doing at the time when I made that I didn't know I was doing something strange
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.240]  But I did get some grateful dead some deadhead og seeds
[09:30.240 --> 09:36.880]  Which is chem 91 and SF the San Fernando Valley og kush f4. They were crossed to make the deadhead og
[09:36.880 --> 09:39.800]  I did some feminizing and reversing of that. I crossed
[09:40.480 --> 09:42.560]  Phenotype the same phenotype I selfed it
[09:42.720 --> 09:48.580]  Then I took the seed that came out of that and pollinated that with the original mom that I used
[09:48.580 --> 09:54.000]  So I kind of did some inbreeding. I pollinated one of the offspring with the original mom to make a super femme plant
[09:54.640 --> 10:00.000]  That is the grateful dog that has been crossed to the the arise
[10:00.000 --> 10:03.100]  Which has the chem D in the grandparents?
[10:03.100 --> 10:06.960]  You're gonna see the chem D pop up a little bit. You're gonna see the chem 91 that morning
[10:06.960 --> 10:13.880]  Do is very it's got the that sour sweetness that chem 91 had I know that if you smoked it
[10:13.880 --> 10:14.960]  There's a sour sweetness
[10:14.960 --> 10:19.280]  It's not the dominant flavor, but that's what kind of gives it a little bit of a funk to it
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.600]  That's sour sweetness, but it's also got the fuel and the cushy aromas that you expect from a good chem
[10:24.680 --> 10:30.000]  So I think the morning do is probably the closest you're gonna get for a chem 91
[10:30.240 --> 10:32.500]  With my sort of a twist on it
[10:32.500 --> 10:36.700]  The next thing that I think you would really enjoy is a new cross that does not have a name
[10:37.260 --> 10:39.820]  It is in the works. It will need a great name
[10:39.820 --> 10:44.340]  I'm not even sure that I want to reveal the cross yet. Do we do it here on the show?
[10:44.340 --> 10:51.420]  Yeah, we do it. Why not? I am in the works of crossing the p91 to the arise that will have some amazing
[10:52.060 --> 10:56.860]  Gassy funky smells it will smell a lot like that old-school stuff and it should have a lot of that good buzz to it
[10:56.860 --> 10:59.980]  I haven't done it yet. It's in the process. They're in the room together
[11:00.300 --> 11:02.300]  It's almost time for the magic to happen
[11:02.860 --> 11:09.580]  But the p91 to arise will be something that will make you very happy. All right, I think I answered that question. It was good
[11:10.500 --> 11:14.280]  Connecting with somebody who was very has a very similar story to myself
[11:15.900 --> 11:20.420]  Very passionately curious I love learning I just wasn't interested in school because
[11:21.060 --> 11:23.900]  They taught me all that. I feel like everything I learned in school
[11:23.900 --> 11:29.480]  I learned probably in like third or fourth grade and then fifth and sixth grade was just a repeat of that shit and then ninth
[11:29.480 --> 11:35.680]  And tenth grades were repeats of all this shit all over again, and they just repeated it and I didn't write what they just kept
[11:35.680 --> 11:37.640]  Teaching in the same dumb shit. They didn't go much further
[11:37.640 --> 11:43.960]  I felt like I learned much more in life and became successful as a cannabis consumer after school
[11:43.960 --> 11:49.000]  Yeah, so we have a lot in common. We both love that fish tour grateful dead stuff and the chem
[11:49.000 --> 11:53.240]  I hope answers your question, bro. And I do hope to see you at a fish show or a
[11:54.320 --> 11:58.100]  Wherever we end up a dead and company show maybe a dark star orchestra show
[11:59.100 --> 12:04.400]  Let's hang out bro smoke some some good dog weed some morning dew or something. All right, I am awful rambly
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.980]  I got good in stone at the start of this episode. I have no idea how long I've been recording by the way
[12:08.980 --> 12:10.060]  So this will be long and fun
[12:10.060 --> 12:15.700]  I do have another episode here in front of me another one that does reference the chem dog and it says
[12:16.620 --> 12:18.580]  Rasta Jeff, I love it when they start like that
[12:18.580 --> 12:22.900]  I was just listening to your podcast and you referenced the chem dog and the 13 beans
[12:22.940 --> 12:26.340]  Yes, I'm getting a lot of responses because of that episode and I love it
[12:26.340 --> 12:31.500]  Says man talk about some lineage that shaped the East Coast cannabis scene
[12:31.500 --> 12:31.980]  Yeah
[12:31.980 --> 12:38.780]  some of my favorite strains come from the chem 91 some of my favorite stuff has chem 91 and it's a my favorite crosses that
[12:38.780 --> 12:42.380]  I've made have cam and other chem lines in there
[12:42.380 --> 12:46.740]  So yeah, it really shaped the East Coast and I think it shaped all of the cannabis seem to tell you the truth, bro
[12:46.740 --> 12:53.100]  Not just on the East but yeah, it started there and trickled out this way. It says anyway, I went camping this year
[12:53.340 --> 12:55.100]  I'm not sure if I should say exact
[12:55.100 --> 13:00.620]  Yeah, I went camping this year in Bethel for a Spartan race and took a trip over to the Woodstock Museum
[13:00.620 --> 13:08.300]  I got lucky chatting with an old head who offered me a quarter of his slightly stupid or slightly seeded but stupid
[13:08.740 --> 13:09.820]  stony
[13:09.820 --> 13:12.860]  cookies and chem so this herb was slightly seeded and
[13:13.980 --> 13:15.460]  stupid stony
[13:15.460 --> 13:20.380]  Cookies and chem so you got some Girl Scout cookies and then you got some chem in there could be chem D
[13:20.380 --> 13:23.060]  It could be chem dog. It could be a lot of things but cookies and chem
[13:24.620 --> 13:26.740]  That's also known as the GMO
[13:27.460 --> 13:33.380]  GMO is also known as chem cookies or garlic cookies. So you could have something like that in there. That's a great cross
[13:33.780 --> 13:37.720]  But he says maybe it was just the scenery and the atmosphere or whatever
[13:37.720 --> 13:42.460]  But I'm telling you it was some of the best herb herb I have ever touched in my life
[13:43.460 --> 13:49.740]  It was the atmosphere the environment the surprise of finding some new head at a really cool place smoking you out
[13:50.500 --> 13:52.020]  and
[13:52.020 --> 13:57.020]  Also, it was like a change if you I feel like if I smoke the same herb all the time herb that I grew
[13:57.380 --> 14:01.780]  Herb from the same Grover's around here if I smoke the same concentrates all the time the same jar
[14:01.780 --> 14:04.340]  I feel like the buzz gets boring. I don't get as
[14:04.940 --> 14:08.480]  Buzzed medicated. I don't feel the effect as much if I smoke
[14:08.980 --> 14:12.500]  One gram of the same concentrate all day by the end of the day
[14:12.500 --> 14:15.680]  I got to switch jars and smoke something different and then I'll get a better buzz
[14:15.680 --> 14:21.040]  So part of it was you switching up your intake your medicine you ate at a different restaurant. So it just tasted better
[14:21.280 --> 14:24.920]  It's gonna be like that all the time, but I think that contributed it contributed
[14:25.920 --> 14:29.040]  Contributed did to it. That's what I meant to say. I promise you
[14:29.480 --> 14:34.240]  That really contributed to the the experience is where you were the new person
[14:34.240 --> 14:37.760]  But then of course that new product was totally different your body was like well
[14:37.760 --> 14:41.440]  These are different turps and different cannabinoids that I'm not familiar with in different ratios
[14:41.440 --> 14:47.420]  This is kind of nice and you were just out there loving life feeling irish. So it was a definitely a good different buzz now
[14:47.420 --> 14:49.420]  Let's get to the fun part. I
[14:49.540 --> 14:56.220]  Found eight seeds one of which doesn't look viable, but I kept it just in case I got them stashed away for safekeeping
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.600]  But man, I can't wait for the day. I get that itch to pop these seeds
[15:02.120 --> 15:05.040]  So if you found eight of them and one looks unviable
[15:05.040 --> 15:09.120]  You've got seven seeds and I think they say seven is a lucky number
[15:09.120 --> 15:14.440]  So you've got seven lucky seeds from your friend from the Woodstock Museum. I
[15:15.100 --> 15:21.760]  Cannot believe those seeds are not already germinated if I had gotten those seeds from that head in that situation
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.360]  I would have be they would be in dirt. You already be getting tests of what they grew like from me
[15:26.400 --> 15:28.400]  That's just how that would go
[15:28.860 --> 15:31.460]  What a great story and I'm glad that the chem dog
[15:31.880 --> 15:36.360]  Reference and the chem dog story brought that up and then I'm glad that that just happened that
[15:36.600 --> 15:39.340]  Some old head at the Woodstock Museum of all places
[15:40.200 --> 15:46.760]  Had some slightly seeded but what are the what's the word here stupid stony cookies and chem?
[15:47.400 --> 15:51.560]  Whatever you paid for that bag of weed unless what'd you get? You got a quarter?
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.600]  You got eight seeds in there if you paid around like 70 80 bucks
[15:55.720 --> 15:57.600]  You definitely got a fucking good deal
[15:57.600 --> 16:03.280]  If you paid 50 bucks, you got a magical deal because those eight seeds in my opinion are worth probably 50 bucks
[16:03.280 --> 16:06.040]  I bet that would have been worth 50 bucks or so to me anyway
[16:06.040 --> 16:11.160]  So yeah, the weed was free the seeds are what you definitely paid for so big come up on that
[16:11.480 --> 16:14.680]  This came from our friend poop grows on patreon
[16:15.880 --> 16:19.280]  excellent name poop does grow no shit, but uh
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.800]  Bro, grow those beans and send me pictures of them or or even better send me some beans, bro
[16:25.800 --> 16:30.540]  No, but grow them you grow them yourself. I'm excited to see what you've got. You've got some chemin cookies
[16:31.260 --> 16:37.060]  Who knows what pollinated that that could be an s1 that could be that could be anything it could be magical
[16:37.060 --> 16:42.200]  You may have the next chem dog in your jar. That may be the next magical strain
[16:42.200 --> 16:47.660]  We've talked about where these strains come from and then we discovered on a previous episode that even the sour D allegedly
[16:48.140 --> 16:52.540]  Possibly was a mistake a bag seed if you will. All right
[16:53.180 --> 16:54.940]  That is enough about the chem stuff
[16:54.940 --> 17:00.060]  I'm sure there are more emails in my patreon more emails in the inbox that I have not discovered
[17:00.180 --> 17:05.420]  The inboxes are full the patreon is loading up. I do check the patreon first, then I head to the inboxes
[17:05.860 --> 17:09.860]  Don't be shy send me more messages patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart
[17:09.860 --> 17:13.260]  The email address is grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.500]  Send me updates. Send me questions. I do love it. Keep the conversation going
[17:18.060 --> 17:22.860]  There is more to this episode. How long have I been recording? I really have no clue
[17:22.860 --> 17:24.860]  I did not press the timer on this device
[17:24.980 --> 17:30.540]  So we're just gonna go and tell I run out of voice I guess this one came from our friend Brian
[17:31.100 --> 17:37.780]  You can call me Brian and it says hey Rasta Jeff. First of all, let me thank you so much for all the knowledge and experience
[17:38.260 --> 17:40.980]  You share. Hey, thank you. You are very welcome
[17:40.980 --> 17:46.540]  I feel like I've been given a gift and if I didn't share my gift, I may spontaneously combust
[17:46.540 --> 17:50.980]  I feel like if I don't record a podcast if I don't play my drums if I don't do a few key things in life
[17:51.300 --> 17:56.520]  Life doesn't go the way it should so thank you for noticing that I do put some effort and share some knowledge into here
[17:56.520 --> 18:01.860]  This is what I was put here for I've got to do this. This is my duty. Thank you for noticing
[18:01.860 --> 18:03.100]  I'm gonna go on with the message
[18:03.100 --> 18:09.540]  It says you maintain a high standard which makes an excellent model for us to base ourselves off of also
[18:09.900 --> 18:11.860]  You hold me to a high standard
[18:11.860 --> 18:15.260]  I'm not allowed to fuck up take a day off get lazy slip up anymore because I know
[18:15.620 --> 18:19.980]  That the irie army the girl from your heart team the whole crew is out there cheering me on
[18:20.340 --> 18:25.780]  Looking forward to me coming out and encouraging you educating you you guys keep me on my game
[18:25.780 --> 18:30.460]  You keep me sharp as well. You expect a lot from me, which it makes me expect a lot from me
[18:30.460 --> 18:36.220]  Which makes you expect it's just inspiring me every day. So thank you guys for the encouragement the motivation
[18:36.820 --> 18:41.100]  Because without you guys on the other end of this it would I would just be a complete psychopath
[18:41.100 --> 18:45.980]  I'd be a guy with too many cameras too many toys and this would look fucking weird. So thank you for all the support
[18:46.620 --> 18:52.420]  It does go on it says I think that's a huge compliment. Also. Thank you. It says my question is
[18:53.460 --> 18:57.060]  When you breed a male and female together you get certain results
[18:57.460 --> 19:04.620]  Yes, then it says would the results be completely different if you switch the male female order and bred those plants
[19:04.620 --> 19:06.460]  Would there be similarities also?
[19:06.460 --> 19:13.980]  What if we were using two females rather than a male female would there be different results and then they break down some examples?
[19:13.980 --> 19:17.900]  I absolutely understand the question here. Let's jump into answering this
[19:18.060 --> 19:22.180]  All right, just to make this question nice and clear what this person is asking
[19:22.300 --> 19:27.820]  We want to do some breeding and we have got plant a and plant B to start the scenario
[19:27.980 --> 19:32.460]  Plant a is the male and plant B is the female they want to breed it that way
[19:32.620 --> 19:39.140]  Then they want to flip the male female around to where the opposite plant is the male and the opposite plant is the female
[19:39.140 --> 19:44.580]  I honestly don't remember how I started but the second round is the opposite of whatever I said the first time
[19:45.100 --> 19:51.580]  Will there be a difference in the outcome in the progeny of that breeding project if we flip them will we see?
[19:51.900 --> 19:54.780]  differences if we were to hypothetically get I'm gonna say
[19:55.420 --> 20:02.300]  OG kush and golden goat if we use it OG kush male and a golden goat female and bred them and then did an OG kush
[20:02.300 --> 20:05.780]  Female and a golden goat male and bred them would we see differences?
[20:07.300 --> 20:14.620]  Depending on your phenotypical selection for your starting plants most likely. Yes, you will see differences
[20:15.420 --> 20:22.780]  the male in my opinion adds a lot to the structure the shape of the plant the potency of the plant the
[20:23.380 --> 20:30.060]  Mildew resistance the pathogen resistance those sort of things. I feel like come from the pollen donor side of the plant
[20:30.300 --> 20:36.740]  So you may see and also it depends on how dominant each plant is in the mix
[20:38.660 --> 20:40.340]  So
[20:40.340 --> 20:46.580]  Let's just say they're even let's just say we've got even dominance on everything. We've selected that they're gonna breed evenly
[20:46.580 --> 20:52.020]  That's really just not common with anything in life. But if we breed them, so you're gonna see
[20:52.660 --> 20:54.660]  you may see more of
[20:55.140 --> 20:56.580]  The dad's
[20:56.580 --> 21:00.860]  Tallness in each side you may get the the height of the dad in each of them
[21:00.860 --> 21:03.820]  You may get the pest resistance from the dad in each of them
[21:03.820 --> 21:10.140]  So if you're OG so OG kush OG kush likes to get a little bit drier golden goat gets really thirsty
[21:10.380 --> 21:16.660]  Whichever dad you used I think you're going to see that trait more dominant in that cross
[21:16.660 --> 21:20.800]  If you use the golden goat dad your offspring are going to be more thirsty
[21:20.800 --> 21:25.600]  If you use the OG kush dad your offspring will be less thirsty
[21:26.280 --> 21:31.040]  Either way you do that cross. So if you if you use this to same plants just flipping the dad
[21:31.040 --> 21:35.400]  I think will have an effect on the amount of thirst in those plants
[21:35.400 --> 21:41.380]  And this is hypothetical because I know that golden goat drinks and eats like crazy and I know that the OG kush plants
[21:41.560 --> 21:43.560]  They don't drink very much. You can almost
[21:44.120 --> 21:47.600]  Starve them and not give them water for a really long time. They'll do better
[21:48.280 --> 21:53.560]  You're more likely to kill an OG kush plant by over watering than under watering so that's what I'm trying to get with there
[21:53.560 --> 21:56.160]  I hope that makes sense. I'm gonna give another example
[21:57.240 --> 22:03.400]  Another good example is if we crossed the grateful dog to the golden goat. This has been done
[22:03.960 --> 22:07.560]  One way it is called the golden road the other way
[22:07.560 --> 22:09.780]  It is called the heart of gold right now
[22:09.780 --> 22:14.760]  My brains playing tricks on me because I'm talking and trying to talk about these two strains and don't have notes on it in front
[22:15.120 --> 22:19.720]  But grateful dog and golden goat have been crossed each way
[22:19.720 --> 22:24.200]  It's where the grateful dog has been the pollen donor and the grateful dog has been the pollen receiver
[22:24.520 --> 22:27.020]  When the golden goat is the pollen donor
[22:27.840 --> 22:30.200]  the progeny makes sweeter
[22:31.800 --> 22:37.160]  Pointier buds, they're sweeter in flavor. They've got more of that tropical flavor and they are pointier
[22:37.160 --> 22:43.160]  That's they're jagged. The leaves are more serrated. The buds are maybe a little bit foxtail II
[22:43.160 --> 22:48.080]  But they just look meaner. The silhouette is just more sharp and jagged. That's why a lot of phenotypes
[22:48.080 --> 22:51.840]  I call it the mean girl phenotype of stuff that I cross with golden goat
[22:51.840 --> 22:57.280]  You can just see it in there now the cross that the grateful dog is the pollen donor
[22:57.560 --> 23:03.160]  Those come out with more of a rounded pine cone shaped bud. They aren't as jagged II. They don't have as many
[23:03.440 --> 23:09.680]  Maybe it's almost foxtailing. Maybe it's fingery. But when I use the grateful dog is the pollen donor. It's tighter
[23:09.760 --> 23:12.480]  It looks more like a tight silver pine cone
[23:12.480 --> 23:15.160]  It gets this silver hue to it a silver tent
[23:15.160 --> 23:18.040]  Maybe a velvety sort of a texture a little bit of purple to it
[23:18.380 --> 23:23.360]  So that's what happens when the grateful dog is the pollen donor. So yes, you will see differences
[23:23.880 --> 23:29.120]  Based on flipping the male and the female you'll see differences and it just depends on
[23:29.480 --> 23:33.000]  Which male and you're gonna find some males that when you breed with them
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.680]  They're really dominant in the mix and you'll find some males
[23:35.680 --> 23:40.560]  They just mix really well with the female and you'll find some that you're just making reproductions of the females
[23:40.680 --> 23:45.640]  So it's kind of about the dominance of the male in your mix and that's really gonna have a huge effect on it
[23:45.640 --> 23:47.960]  But you will see a difference in
[23:48.760 --> 23:50.440]  Which way you do the cross?
[23:50.440 --> 23:52.840]  So like I was saying with the grateful dog to golden goat
[23:53.080 --> 23:58.640]  When the golden goat is the reversal that flavor of the golden goat comes through a little bit better
[23:58.680 --> 24:04.660]  the flowering time of the golden goat comes through but when I use the grateful dog is the pollen donor the flowering time of the
[24:04.660 --> 24:09.260]  Grateful dog the leaf shape and size of the grateful dog seem to dominate that mix
[24:09.260 --> 24:12.420]  So yes, there absolutely is a difference. It does make a huge difference
[24:12.980 --> 24:19.260]  Now the last part also what if you were using two females rather than a male female would there be different results?
[24:19.260 --> 24:24.340]  That's kind of what I was going with just now because I didn't even realize I was talking about two feminized crosses
[24:24.380 --> 24:28.460]  But yes, you will see the differences there. Absolutely. It's gonna work just like the boy-girl
[24:29.060 --> 24:35.980]  May be easier to see because you have seen the females in full flower as their female bud expression
[24:35.980 --> 24:39.180]  So you can identify the traits which are coming from each side
[24:39.420 --> 24:42.980]  Very accurately because you know what the females look like when you're using the boy
[24:43.380 --> 24:47.820]  You just know what the female looks like and you're guessing the other traits came from the boy side not
[24:48.460 --> 24:53.340]  Traits from the history on the mom side. So I think I answer that I think it makes sense
[24:53.860 --> 24:57.380]  They wrap it up with I hope you understand the questions. I totally understand
[24:57.380 --> 25:02.700]  I hope you understood my long and rambly answer. Thank you for the great question
[25:03.020 --> 25:06.780]  That came from my friend. You can call me Brian big up to my friend. You call me Brian
