[00:00.000 --> 00:10.740]  Yeah, welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:10.740 --> 00:11.740]  I'm your host.
[00:11.740 --> 00:18.860]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 672 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:18.860 --> 00:22.460]  In this episode, I'm going to do a little recap from a previous episode.
[00:22.460 --> 00:24.780]  Then I'm going to read a couple of grow questions.
[00:24.780 --> 00:28.080]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:28.080 --> 00:31.440]  folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:31.440 --> 00:33.900]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:33.900 --> 00:34.900]  Thank you.
[00:34.900 --> 00:37.220]  Shout out to my buddy, the Uber driver, Uncle Adam.
[00:37.220 --> 00:40.240]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to the LARF Knight Rises.
[00:40.240 --> 00:41.940]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Growing Tennessee.
[00:41.940 --> 00:46.500]  I want to send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Brian P. Let's send a special
[00:46.500 --> 00:51.260]  thank you shout out to Justin C. Let's send a big fist bump to Noah N. I want to send
[00:51.260 --> 00:54.720]  a big thank you shout out to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[00:54.720 --> 00:57.840]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Grow Man Stan.
[00:58.060 --> 01:00.940]  Let's wrap it all up with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:00.940 --> 01:01.940]  Thank you.
[01:01.940 --> 01:04.000]  Shout out to my buddy, Stoner Dave.
[01:04.000 --> 01:08.840]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:08.840 --> 01:12.520]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:12.520 --> 01:18.920]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:18.920 --> 01:21.460]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:21.460 --> 01:26.020]  You know, I do include a link in the show notes and the video description to make it
[01:26.020 --> 01:29.460]  nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:29.460 --> 01:33.220]  I do want to give a shout out to all of the people with the super cool and creative names.
[01:33.220 --> 01:37.780]  I was writing podcast episodes today, scrolling through Patreon, taking names off one screen,
[01:37.780 --> 01:40.860]  putting them onto another to get them here into the show.
[01:40.860 --> 01:45.540]  There are some great creative names in this month's Patreon campaign.
[01:45.540 --> 01:48.100]  I'm going to get to say a bunch of funny, goofy shit.
[01:48.100 --> 01:49.100]  Big shout out, you guys.
[01:49.100 --> 01:51.260]  I love the creativity.
[01:51.260 --> 01:53.700]  The LARP Night Rises is pretty fucking cool.
[01:53.900 --> 01:59.260]  All right, let's keep myself on track because I am stoned and we know how I can get off track.
[01:59.260 --> 02:02.580]  This is the part of the show where I invite you to join the Discord server.
[02:02.580 --> 02:06.020]  There are about 1,200 people hanging out on the Discord server right now.
[02:06.020 --> 02:07.940]  We're having a good time over there.
[02:07.940 --> 02:10.300]  There's a live chat where people are hanging out.
[02:10.300 --> 02:12.800]  There are a lot of text chats where people are hanging out.
[02:12.800 --> 02:13.800]  There are waffles.
[02:13.800 --> 02:15.060]  There are actions.
[02:15.060 --> 02:19.940]  And just the other morning, I logged in to go jump into the live video chat and they
[02:19.940 --> 02:22.300]  were doing stoner yoga.
[02:22.300 --> 02:26.700]  They had a real yoga teacher doing real, legit yoga.
[02:26.700 --> 02:32.140]  You can be in the privacy of your own home and you can do stoner yoga with the IRE Army.
[02:32.140 --> 02:36.180]  If you're interested in joining the Discord, you don't have to do yoga, but you're cordially
[02:36.180 --> 02:41.420]  invited to the yoga, jump in, join the Grow From Your Heart podcast, IRE Genetics Discord
[02:41.420 --> 02:42.420]  channel.
[02:42.420 --> 02:45.500]  There's a link, of course, in the show notes and the video description.
[02:45.500 --> 02:50.220]  I will pop it up right here on the screen when I do some editing.
[02:50.220 --> 02:51.780]  There you go, Discord.
[02:51.780 --> 02:52.780]  Join us.
[02:52.780 --> 02:53.780]  It's a good time.
[02:53.780 --> 02:55.620]  I do pop into the live chat quite often, hang out.
[02:55.620 --> 02:57.700]  Sometimes when I'm just packing up seeds, I'll sit there.
[02:57.700 --> 03:01.300]  I got my head down, but I got my AirPods in and I'm just packing up seeds and talking
[03:01.300 --> 03:02.300]  to the crew.
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.980]  I need someone to hang out with sometimes.
[03:03.980 --> 03:06.780]  I decide to go to the Discord channel and hang out with the crew.
[03:06.780 --> 03:10.260]  Shout out to everybody over there hanging out right now, keeping me entertained.
[03:10.260 --> 03:13.540]  Sometimes I just pop in and take dabs and I say, I'm going to go hang out in the Discord
[03:13.540 --> 03:18.460]  for a minute or five and it ends up being 55 minutes to maybe 100 minutes.
[03:18.460 --> 03:19.660]  You never know how it goes with me.
[03:19.660 --> 03:20.660]  All right.
[03:20.660 --> 03:21.660]  I am stoned and rambly.
[03:21.740 --> 03:22.740]  Keep me moving.
[03:22.740 --> 03:25.300]  The next portion of the show is not the best news.
[03:25.300 --> 03:26.740]  I do have some terrible bad news.
[03:26.740 --> 03:28.660]  I hate these parts of the podcast.
[03:28.660 --> 03:31.220]  I've been talking about the Endo Expo quite a bit.
[03:31.220 --> 03:35.580]  The Endo Expo is the world's largest indoor cultivation expo.
[03:35.580 --> 03:37.060]  It is a cultivation expo.
[03:37.060 --> 03:38.940]  It's focused on hemp and cannabis.
[03:38.940 --> 03:44.220]  A lot of the leading nutrient companies, a lot of the leading light companies, any innovative
[03:44.220 --> 03:48.360]  company and brand and product that is trying to put themselves into the market or advertise
[03:48.360 --> 03:51.880]  in the cannabis and hemp space comes to the Endo Expo.
[03:51.880 --> 03:55.520]  A lot of your favorite breeders would normally be at the Endo Expo.
[03:55.520 --> 03:57.560]  I usually have a booth at the Endo Expo.
[03:57.560 --> 04:04.880]  I've paid for a booth and at this time, I do not know if the Denver Endo Expo is happening.
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.880]  Unfortunately, Chris, the owner of the Endo Expo passed away suddenly.
[04:08.880 --> 04:10.120]  It was not expected.
[04:10.120 --> 04:13.820]  I guess no death is expected, but rest in peace, Chris.
[04:13.820 --> 04:14.820]  You will be missed.
[04:14.820 --> 04:17.920]  He did a great service to the industry and the community, but the owner of the Endo Expo
[04:18.480 --> 04:20.120]  has passed away at this time.
[04:20.120 --> 04:21.560]  The Endo Expo is up in the air.
[04:21.560 --> 04:24.040]  The Chicago show was canceled.
[04:24.040 --> 04:25.880]  The Denver show is up in the air.
[04:25.880 --> 04:29.340]  Nobody will give anybody a heads up, any details or anything.
[04:29.340 --> 04:33.120]  I'm not sure how much I'm allowed to say, so I won't say too much here on the show,
[04:33.120 --> 04:36.160]  but I don't have anybody to contact for the Endo Expo anymore.
[04:36.160 --> 04:37.800]  They are not responding to emails.
[04:37.800 --> 04:38.800]  Nothing is happening.
[04:38.800 --> 04:42.560]  So if you're making plans to travel across the country, across the world, I've got friends.
[04:42.560 --> 04:43.760]  This is why I'm saying this.
[04:43.760 --> 04:48.760]  I've got friends that were planning to travel from across the country or across the world,
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.240]  from other countries, from all over the country to Denver for the Endo Expo in the middle
[04:53.240 --> 04:54.320]  of winter.
[04:54.320 --> 04:56.920]  They're making a big adventure, a big trek and big plans.
[04:56.920 --> 04:58.400]  I'm giving you a heads up and warning.
[04:58.400 --> 05:02.240]  If you are planning on attending the Denver Endo Expo, you're spending money, making plans,
[05:02.240 --> 05:07.400]  putting energy and effort into that, you may want to put all of that shit on hold until
[05:07.400 --> 05:08.400]  further notice.
[05:08.400 --> 05:10.120]  I do not know if the Endo Expo will happen.
[05:10.120 --> 05:11.880]  I'm trying to do a positive service.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.080]  I'm not trying to start rumors, talk shit, create any sort of thing like that.
[05:15.080 --> 05:17.560]  I'm letting my friends and the community know.
[05:17.560 --> 05:18.560]  You guys are my crew.
[05:18.560 --> 05:20.920]  It's important that everybody knows the Endo Expo may not happen.
[05:20.920 --> 05:24.400]  If you're spending money, putting energy and effort into that, slow down.
[05:24.400 --> 05:26.040]  Don't waste your time, energy, money, effort.
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.400]  It may not even happen.
[05:27.400 --> 05:29.720]  So unfortunately, there was a death.
[05:29.720 --> 05:31.240]  There's nothing we can do about that.
[05:31.240 --> 05:35.800]  We have to give the family time and space and let them handle all of their stuff.
[05:35.800 --> 05:39.520]  Then the business will come whenever they care to deal with the business.
[05:39.520 --> 05:41.600]  Right now, obviously, it's not the time.
[05:41.600 --> 05:43.040]  When the time comes, they will do that.
[05:43.040 --> 05:44.800]  So I'm not talking any trash.
[05:44.800 --> 05:46.000]  I'm not creating any drama.
[05:46.000 --> 05:47.440]  I'm letting you know.
[05:47.440 --> 05:51.960]  Don't spend your money or energy yet because you might buy a plane ticket, book a hotel
[05:51.960 --> 05:55.860]  room, might buy a new banner and a bunch of special packaging, and it might be a waste
[05:55.860 --> 05:56.860]  of time.
[05:56.860 --> 05:57.860]  So don't do that just yet.
[05:57.860 --> 06:00.760]  I'll try to keep you updated as soon as I know something.
[06:00.760 --> 06:03.480]  Again, though, truly, honestly, rest in peace, Chris.
[06:03.480 --> 06:06.080]  I don't want to make this sound like I'm bashing anybody.
[06:06.080 --> 06:07.080]  The man is gone.
[06:07.080 --> 06:09.400]  There's a lot of grieving to be done.
[06:09.480 --> 06:11.880]  But also, business needs to be mentioned.
[06:11.880 --> 06:16.240]  So mixed emotions, mixed things going on there.
[06:16.240 --> 06:19.000]  Now let's segue into a different part of the podcast.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.640]  If you're watching on that camera, booyah, you notice I'm wearing a brand new blue raspberry
[06:23.640 --> 06:24.640]  truffle t-shirt.
[06:24.640 --> 06:25.640]  That's right.
[06:25.640 --> 06:27.440]  I've got the iRegenetics blue raspberry truffle t-shirt on.
[06:27.440 --> 06:30.640]  I'm going to move the iPad out of the way here just so you can get a good, sweet view
[06:30.640 --> 06:31.640]  of that.
[06:31.640 --> 06:32.640]  That's right.
[06:32.640 --> 06:33.640]  It's got the blue raspberry truffle logo on there.
[06:33.640 --> 06:38.440]  If you've purchased blue raspberry truffle seeds recently, they've been sold out for
[06:38.480 --> 06:39.480]  a minute.
[06:39.480 --> 06:42.360]  But if you got some of the last batch, they did come in this packaging.
[06:42.360 --> 06:45.120]  The packaging, the shirt, and the sticker all match.
[06:45.120 --> 06:48.160]  I've got a t-shirt, a sticker, and a package for it now.
[06:48.160 --> 06:50.400]  You know a strain sticks around once I do that.
[06:50.400 --> 06:51.400]  There are only a few of those.
[06:51.400 --> 06:56.720]  The Orangegasm, Lemon Jeffery, the Golden Goat, those all have shirts and stickers and
[06:56.720 --> 06:57.760]  custom packaging.
[06:57.760 --> 07:00.160]  The Arise has a custom shirt, sticker, and package.
[07:00.160 --> 07:03.400]  And now, welcome blue raspberry truffle to that gang.
[07:03.400 --> 07:04.400]  You can get yours.
[07:04.400 --> 07:07.880]  Where I am headed with this is if you would like to dress like me and be like one of the
[07:08.320 --> 07:11.000]  cool kids, you can grab your blue raspberry truffle shirt.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.320]  You can even get an Orangegasm hoodie or an Orangegasm t-shirt.
[07:14.320 --> 07:17.040]  There are four styles of grinders.
[07:17.040 --> 07:18.040]  There were three.
[07:18.040 --> 07:21.040]  I recently added a brand new design of the grinders onto the website.
[07:21.040 --> 07:24.040]  Also there are three different designs of rolling trays.
[07:24.040 --> 07:29.320]  So if you need to get some rolling trays or some merch, visit the website, ireegenetics.com.
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.240]  You will find a link on there that says Iree Web Store.
[07:33.240 --> 07:35.240]  Get yourself to the web store when you check out.
[07:35.240 --> 07:36.800]  Do use the coupon code.
[07:36.800 --> 07:38.360]  It is podcast10.
[07:38.360 --> 07:41.800]  When you use that coupon code podcast10, you will save 10%.
[07:41.800 --> 07:47.600]  And of course, every order over $30 does get free shipping off the website.
[07:47.600 --> 07:52.840]  And of course, this is on the merchandise, the shirts, the stickers, the coffee cups.
[07:52.840 --> 07:54.920]  There are rolling trays, grinders.
[07:54.920 --> 07:56.880]  There's a lot of great stuff on there and new stuff coming.
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.640]  I've ordered a lot of things, but during these times, it takes a long time for merchandise
[08:00.640 --> 08:01.960]  to be manufactured.
[08:01.960 --> 08:04.960]  Big shout out to those companies who make my stuff super quickly.
[08:04.960 --> 08:05.960]  You impress me sometimes.
[08:06.120 --> 08:08.120]  I'm still waiting on some things.
[08:08.120 --> 08:09.920]  Some people got their stuff here super fast.
[08:09.920 --> 08:10.920]  You know who you are.
[08:10.920 --> 08:12.880]  But I've got a lot of great merch coming.
[08:12.880 --> 08:16.680]  The merch I'm talking about that I'm giving you the coupon code, if you go to the Iree
[08:16.680 --> 08:18.720]  Genetics website, you click on that web store.
[08:18.720 --> 08:22.440]  It says the Iree merch store, the Iree store that takes you to the store there where there
[08:22.440 --> 08:24.200]  are shirts and things available.
[08:24.200 --> 08:28.200]  That is where the coupon code podcast10 will work for you.
[08:28.200 --> 08:31.960]  Also orders over $30 there will get free shipping.
[08:31.960 --> 08:32.960]  So keep that in mind.
[08:32.960 --> 08:34.080]  That'll help you out a little bit.
[08:34.080 --> 08:38.760]  Coupon code podcast10, save 10%, spend $30 and get free shipping.
[08:38.760 --> 08:45.000]  Those two things do stack up so you can get the free shipping and save 10%.
[08:45.000 --> 08:51.400]  Also by the time this episode comes out, seedsherenow.com should have a pretty fresh restock of Iree
[08:51.400 --> 08:52.400]  Genetics.
[08:52.400 --> 08:56.840]  Make sure you check out seedsherenow.com and use coupon code GFYH10.
[08:56.840 --> 08:59.880]  That will save you 10% at seedsherenow.com.
[09:00.880 --> 09:03.760]  All right, now let's move into the main part of this podcast.
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.280]  I feel like I've paid all the bills, done all of the housekeeping.
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.520]  Let's get to the part that you signed in for the main topic of today's podcast.
[09:12.520 --> 09:15.960]  In the previous episode, I talked about bud washing.
[09:15.960 --> 09:21.340]  That was a process, a practice of dunking our buds into a solution of water and maybe
[09:21.340 --> 09:27.240]  possibly hydrogen peroxide in an effort to clean those buds of any contaminants that
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.720]  may have stuck to those buds, whether it was dust, powdery mildew.
[09:31.720 --> 09:35.840]  We talked about bird poop and bug poop, anything that may have gathered on those buds during
[09:35.840 --> 09:36.840]  their process.
[09:36.840 --> 09:40.680]  I said this was doable on indoor and outdoor greenhouse gardens.
[09:40.680 --> 09:43.200]  You can do this on just about any grow.
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.400]  Then I realized as I was watching the video and doing some editing, I should have mentioned
[09:47.400 --> 09:52.360]  that you can do the same type of process while the plants are growing.
[09:52.360 --> 09:57.280]  While the plants are still growing alive, happening, you can treat them with the same
[09:57.280 --> 09:58.840]  type of solution.
[09:58.840 --> 10:03.440]  If you do encounter a powdery mildew situation in your indoor grow environment, of course,
[10:03.440 --> 10:08.000]  the first step is to find what is causing that powdery mildew.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.280]  It's probably a vapor pressure deficit issue, a VPD issue.
[10:12.280 --> 10:17.800]  You probably have either too high or too low of humidity, too high or too low of heat,
[10:17.800 --> 10:20.440]  or possibly insufficient airflow.
[10:20.440 --> 10:23.320]  Those are most common causes of powdery mildew.
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.040]  We need to diagnose and correct the cause of the powdery mildew.
[10:27.040 --> 10:30.800]  The first thing you're going to do is freak out and want to fix the plants, which sounds
[10:30.800 --> 10:36.520]  good, but if you don't fix the cause, even if you fix the plants, it's coming back in
[10:36.520 --> 10:37.520]  a few days.
[10:37.520 --> 10:38.640]  You could do everything you could.
[10:38.640 --> 10:42.760]  You could polish every single leaf, but if you don't cure the room, correct the issue,
[10:42.760 --> 10:46.840]  find a good solution, or find a very good preventative measure that you can apply other
[10:46.840 --> 10:49.440]  than the room, then you're going to keep getting it.
[10:49.440 --> 10:55.360]  Let me segue into talking about how to treat with a hydrogen peroxide or H2O2 solution
[10:55.360 --> 10:56.960]  for powdery mildew.
[10:56.960 --> 10:59.560]  First step, of course, is to figure out why you're getting it.
[10:59.560 --> 11:00.600]  Try to correct the room.
[11:00.600 --> 11:02.720]  That is going to be your own adventure.
[11:02.720 --> 11:04.000]  You're going to have to correct that.
[11:04.000 --> 11:06.640]  Maybe add some airflow, maybe add some fans.
[11:06.640 --> 11:07.640]  Correct your VPD.
[11:07.640 --> 11:09.200]  Do you have too much humidity?
[11:09.200 --> 11:10.280]  Do you have too much heat?
[11:10.280 --> 11:11.640]  Do you have too much cool?
[11:11.640 --> 11:13.000]  Do you have big swings?
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.040]  When the lights come on, lights go off, are you getting big humidity swings, humidity
[11:17.040 --> 11:18.040]  spikes, humidity drops?
[11:18.040 --> 11:21.440]  Are you getting crazy swings during the night and during the day?
[11:21.440 --> 11:24.840]  Are your temperature swings drastic during the night and during the day?
[11:24.840 --> 11:30.880]  If you can get everything sort of more stabilized, that will prevent the production and development
[11:30.880 --> 11:33.360]  of powdery mildew.
[11:33.360 --> 11:35.560]  So there are a lot of different types of powdery mildew.
[11:35.560 --> 11:39.560]  So some people will say keep it more dry, keep it more humid, keep it warmer, keep it
[11:39.560 --> 11:40.560]  cooler.
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.720]  Unfortunately, there's a type of powdery mildew for all conditions.
[11:43.720 --> 11:47.720]  If the plants can live in there and thrive in there, so can the powdery mildew, so can
[11:47.720 --> 11:49.240]  the bugs, so can all the other shit.
[11:49.240 --> 11:50.720]  They all love the same thing.
[11:50.720 --> 11:52.480]  That's just how nature works.
[11:52.480 --> 11:55.960]  Wherever you want to put on flip-flop sunglasses, take off your shirt, wear some shorts and
[11:55.960 --> 11:59.800]  have a good time, so do the plants, so do the bugs, so does the powdery mildew.
[11:59.800 --> 12:02.080]  It loves all the same shit as us.
[12:02.080 --> 12:07.840]  The thing that brings it on the most is those crazy drastic changes and improper VPD.
[12:07.840 --> 12:10.480]  Now let me focus in on how to take care of it.
[12:10.480 --> 12:13.100]  Let's say you see some powdery mildew happening.
[12:13.100 --> 12:14.640]  Let's say it's getting a little thick on the leaves.
[12:14.640 --> 12:16.200]  We got a couple of options.
[12:16.200 --> 12:20.800]  In the last episode, I talked about using 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[12:20.800 --> 12:22.880]  H2O2 is very similar.
[12:22.880 --> 12:27.720]  I believe they will work at the same rates and same consistencies, and they'll work at
[12:27.720 --> 12:32.380]  the same efficacy is the word I'm searching for in my head as I ramble my way to it.
[12:32.380 --> 12:35.880]  Hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 will work just as well.
[12:35.880 --> 12:39.720]  The good hydrogen peroxide, the 30%, not the stuff from Walmart.
[12:39.720 --> 12:40.800]  You've got to get the good stuff.
[12:40.800 --> 12:44.520]  They may sell the 30% at Walmart by now, who knows, but the good shit.
[12:44.840 --> 12:47.560]  Stuff you normally buy, I think, is 3%.
[12:47.560 --> 12:49.880]  You've got to get the better stuff.
[12:49.880 --> 12:54.480]  When you use either of these products, here comes the dad in me, here comes the pesticide
[12:54.480 --> 12:55.480]  trainer in me.
[12:55.480 --> 13:00.280]  Make sure that you use the proper protective personal equipment when you're using these
[13:00.280 --> 13:01.280]  products.
[13:01.280 --> 13:02.280]  They're both caustic.
[13:02.280 --> 13:03.280]  They'll burn your skin.
[13:03.280 --> 13:04.280]  They'll burn your fingers.
[13:04.280 --> 13:05.920]  They'll burn the living shit out of your eyes.
[13:05.920 --> 13:07.640]  I know you're saying, you're going to put these on the plants.
[13:07.640 --> 13:10.880]  Yes, we're going to dilute it very heavily.
[13:10.880 --> 13:15.400]  When you're using these bottles, these products, please wear gloves and wear goggles or some
[13:15.400 --> 13:16.880]  sort of eye protection.
[13:16.880 --> 13:19.400]  Most of you are going to ignore the eye protection.
[13:19.400 --> 13:24.400]  Please do it, but please for sure at least wear gloves when you're mixing and applying
[13:24.400 --> 13:25.400]  this product.
[13:25.400 --> 13:30.600]  In the last episode, I focused mostly on the hydrogen peroxide and H2O2 because those are
[13:30.600 --> 13:33.320]  what I would recommend for a bud wash.
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.280]  If we're going to harvest the plants, dunk them into a product, and then they're going
[13:37.280 --> 13:41.480]  to dry and basically be cured and smoked pretty soon from there.
[13:41.480 --> 13:45.700]  That's why I was recommending the H2O2 and the hydrogen peroxide.
[13:45.700 --> 13:47.820]  Those products dissipate, evaporate.
[13:47.820 --> 13:49.120]  They don't stick around very long.
[13:49.120 --> 13:52.420]  They're gone from your plants quite quickly, so they're safe to consume.
[13:52.420 --> 13:54.960]  They don't leave any residue, any aroma.
[13:54.960 --> 13:57.000]  You'll never know they were there.
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.280]  That's why I was recommending those.
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.660]  Those are very good to use as a preventative and corrective spray as well.
[14:02.660 --> 14:04.360]  You see the powdery mildew coming.
[14:04.360 --> 14:07.640]  You can hit it with the H2O2 or the hydrogen peroxide.
[14:07.640 --> 14:13.200]  I would start with approximately 10 to 15 milliliters per gallon, then work your way
[14:13.200 --> 14:14.200]  up.
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.560]  I did say to use about 50 mils, I think, per five gallons of water last time.
[14:18.560 --> 14:22.800]  Honestly, the way that I measure it in a commercial grow is I fill up a few five gallon buckets
[14:22.800 --> 14:25.040]  and I put just a couple of bloops in there.
[14:25.040 --> 14:27.920]  The bottle goes bloop, bloop, bloop.
[14:27.920 --> 14:29.840]  That's my measurement, one bloop.
[14:29.840 --> 14:32.580]  If it's really bad, put a couple of bloops in there.
[14:32.580 --> 14:35.580]  If you've worked with me, you know for sure that's my unit of measurement.
[14:35.580 --> 14:37.180]  Just a couple of bloops per bottle.
[14:37.180 --> 14:38.980]  Don't do glugs, just a couple of bloops.
[14:38.980 --> 14:40.260]  Glug, glug, that's too much.
[14:40.260 --> 14:42.020]  Bloop, that's enough.
[14:42.020 --> 14:44.860]  When you do it, you're going to go, well, it's a couple of bloops and it's enough.
[14:44.860 --> 14:46.260]  You'll figure it out.
[14:46.260 --> 14:48.020]  Start low, go stronger.
[14:48.020 --> 14:51.860]  Go until the powdery mildew is dissolving, but don't bleach the plants.
[14:51.860 --> 14:55.100]  Be careful when you're doing this, increase slowly.
[14:55.100 --> 14:58.980]  Mix up the hydrogen peroxide or the H2O2, don't mix them together.
[14:58.980 --> 15:04.540]  Mix that up into your water and then spray that onto the plants and just spray it directly
[15:04.540 --> 15:06.020]  onto the powdery mildew.
[15:06.020 --> 15:07.020]  Try to wash it off.
[15:07.020 --> 15:10.740]  This product will dissolve the powdery mildew at the same time as washing it off.
[15:10.740 --> 15:14.060]  At the same time, you're washing off all the other dirt and contaminants that may have
[15:14.060 --> 15:15.260]  gathered up on these plants.
[15:15.260 --> 15:18.800]  You're just giving them a nice little peroxide bath.
[15:18.800 --> 15:20.340]  This is not going to damage.
[15:20.340 --> 15:25.020]  We have diluted the caustic products to a level to where they are not going to damage
[15:25.020 --> 15:27.420]  the plants, but they will damage the powdery mildew.
[15:27.420 --> 15:32.940]  The mildew is much weaker than the trichomes, the turps, anything else in there.
[15:32.940 --> 15:36.660]  And those products, the trichomes are protecting everything that we don't want destroyed.
[15:36.660 --> 15:40.760]  The powdery mildew will get decimated by these products.
[15:40.760 --> 15:44.540]  So start off with around 15 milliliters per gallon of water.
[15:44.540 --> 15:45.940]  Work your way up if necessary.
[15:45.940 --> 15:47.060]  I've gone pretty hard.
[15:47.060 --> 15:49.260]  I'm not going to encourage you to go too hard.
[15:49.260 --> 15:53.740]  Now I was focused on those other two products because I was doing the bud wash.
[15:53.740 --> 16:00.460]  Let's talk about some products that we can use as a preventative and as corrective sprays.
[16:00.460 --> 16:05.140]  You can mix the following products together, but do not mix them with the peroxide or the
[16:05.140 --> 16:06.700]  H2O2.
[16:06.700 --> 16:12.780]  The following products I'm going to talk about would be destroyed by the H2O2 or the hydrogen
[16:12.780 --> 16:14.080]  peroxide.
[16:14.080 --> 16:17.740]  You can possibly switch hydrogen peroxide with Xerotal in most cases as well.
[16:17.740 --> 16:18.740]  Let me throw that in there.
[16:18.740 --> 16:21.500]  I forgot to mention Xerotal is a good product.
[16:21.500 --> 16:22.660]  Let me get back on track.
[16:22.660 --> 16:28.340]  Don't mix the hydrogen peroxide, Xerotal or H2O2 with the following products, but do
[16:28.340 --> 16:30.740]  mix the following products in any way you'd like.
[16:30.740 --> 16:37.540]  I think they will work great together in many combos or by themselves or in rotations.
[16:37.540 --> 16:38.540]  So let's talk about them.
[16:38.540 --> 16:44.620]  A few products I like for powdery mildew and fungicide and mold control in an indoor environment,
[16:44.620 --> 16:49.820]  a greenhouse environment or outdoor is a product called Cease.
[16:49.820 --> 16:52.460]  Cease is very cost effective.
[16:52.460 --> 16:53.940]  I don't have a bottle of Cease near me.
[16:53.940 --> 16:56.100]  I should have researched to see what was in there.
[16:56.100 --> 17:01.340]  It is a beneficial bacteria that will gather on your leaf when you spray it and it out
[17:01.340 --> 17:03.220]  battles the powdery mildew.
[17:03.220 --> 17:06.320]  This beneficial bacteria does no harm to the plant.
[17:06.320 --> 17:11.020]  It doesn't hurt us or anything, but it does make it undesirable for powdery mildew.
[17:11.020 --> 17:16.360]  So you've laid a protective layer over your plants by applying Cease.
[17:16.360 --> 17:20.500]  Another great product that does a very similar thing is Double Nickel.
[17:20.540 --> 17:26.860]  You can apply Double Nickel and Cease each at 45 milliliters per gallon of water.
[17:26.860 --> 17:31.980]  Both of these products are approved by the Colorado Department of Agriculture for use
[17:31.980 --> 17:36.420]  in the production of recreational and medical cannabis.
[17:36.420 --> 17:42.460]  So Cease and Double Nickel, you can use those in a commercial environment or in your personal
[17:42.460 --> 17:43.460]  grow.
[17:43.460 --> 17:46.700]  They will work great for the powdery mildew.
[17:46.700 --> 17:51.660]  Other things you can use, a product called Regalia is great for powdery mildew.
[17:51.660 --> 17:56.760]  And then also sometimes you can use Grandivo, but Grandivo kind of makes a mess and I would
[17:56.760 --> 17:59.340]  use the other three products first.
[17:59.340 --> 18:05.580]  So Cease, Double Nickel and Regalia are the three things I would recommend for your powdery
[18:05.580 --> 18:06.580]  mildew problem.
[18:06.580 --> 18:10.180]  If it's getting out of hand, if it's getting thick, if it's getting chunky, hit it with
[18:11.180 --> 18:13.820]  H2O2 or Xerotol.
[18:13.820 --> 18:19.580]  But that will destroy the colonies of beneficial bacteria as you have built up with the Cease,
[18:19.580 --> 18:22.500]  the Double Nickel, the Regalia and the Grandivo.
[18:22.500 --> 18:27.380]  So that is kind of a final resort sort of a thing or that's a panic mode or a holy shit,
[18:27.380 --> 18:31.020]  this is thick and it looks like frosted donuts in here sort of attack.
[18:31.020 --> 18:35.060]  But the H2O2, Xerotol, Hydrogen Peroxide will work.
[18:35.060 --> 18:36.060]  One of those.
[18:36.060 --> 18:38.120]  Don't triple, double up on those products.
[18:38.120 --> 18:39.120]  Just use one of those.
[18:39.120 --> 18:40.480]  They're non-toxic.
[18:40.480 --> 18:41.960]  They will dissolve the powdery mildew.
[18:41.960 --> 18:42.960]  It's all you need.
[18:42.960 --> 18:43.960]  Excuse me for the kombucha burps, guys.
[18:43.960 --> 18:44.960]  I'll get that under control.
[18:44.960 --> 18:47.940]  I won't drink kombucha before the next episode.
[18:47.940 --> 18:52.800]  So other things that we need to do, we're going to apply either preventative or corrective
[18:52.800 --> 18:53.800]  sprays.
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.080]  We're going to start off with things like Cease and Double Nickel or Regalia.
[18:57.080 --> 19:01.040]  And then if it gets too out of control, we'll step up our game and use Hydrogen Peroxide,
[19:01.040 --> 19:04.280]  H2O2 or Xerotol.
[19:04.280 --> 19:08.840]  The good thing about the Cease and the Double Nickel is in most cases, if you are using
[19:08.840 --> 19:12.960]  beneficial insects, they will not destroy your beneficial insects.
[19:12.960 --> 19:17.960]  The Hydrogen Peroxide and H2O2 is really going to piss off the beneficial insects.
[19:17.960 --> 19:20.040]  Cease and Double Nickel, they should stick around.
[19:20.040 --> 19:22.000]  The Regalia, I can't testify.
[19:22.000 --> 19:24.960]  I do not know what the Regalia will do to your beneficials.
[19:24.960 --> 19:28.560]  I have not tried that with beneficials in the same mix.
[19:28.560 --> 19:33.440]  The Cease and Double Nickel, I've done that with Swarski's, Persimilis, Hypoaspis, Miles,
[19:33.440 --> 19:34.560]  and Lacewings.
[19:34.560 --> 19:37.840]  I've done it with all those guys still around and they survive and live through it.
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.680]  It doesn't disrupt them.
[19:39.680 --> 19:44.080]  So that's the Cease and Double Nickel that you can do with the beneficial bugs.
[19:44.080 --> 19:47.160]  Other things that we can do, we've got to put some work into this.
[19:47.160 --> 19:49.400]  You're going to have to correct the room.
[19:49.400 --> 19:52.360]  Then before we spray, why not defoliate?
[19:52.360 --> 19:55.660]  If we just go in there and take off most of the leaves, if those leaves aren't there,
[19:55.660 --> 19:57.400]  they can't be problematic.
[19:57.400 --> 19:59.440]  Let me back up.
[19:59.440 --> 20:00.600]  We know what time it is.
[20:00.600 --> 20:01.600]  Put on a mask.
[20:01.600 --> 20:03.080]  You should probably already have a mask, right?
[20:03.720 --> 20:04.720]  It's in the car, it's in your pocket.
[20:04.720 --> 20:05.920]  Grab a mask, put on a mask.
[20:05.920 --> 20:09.600]  Let's not fuck with this powdery mildew too heavily without a mask.
[20:09.600 --> 20:13.200]  Maybe a little bit, but if the powdery mildew is getting funky, if it's getting thick, why
[20:13.200 --> 20:14.280]  not put on a mask?
[20:14.280 --> 20:15.740]  You might not want to breathe it.
[20:15.740 --> 20:17.680]  Just put on a little, just a C word mask.
[20:17.680 --> 20:18.680]  I don't want to say it.
[20:18.680 --> 20:22.400]  I don't want to get us in that category on YouTube, but just put on a light mask just
[20:22.400 --> 20:25.200]  to cover it up so you aren't breathing the dust because you're going to jostle those
[20:25.200 --> 20:26.320]  leaves, rattle the leaves.
[20:26.320 --> 20:27.680]  You'll have it on your fingers.
[20:27.680 --> 20:30.520]  Let's just try not to inhale too much of that powdery mildew.
[20:30.520 --> 20:32.240]  Let's put on a mask.
[20:32.400 --> 20:36.000]  Let's probably put on some gloves so you don't have sticky hands and powdery mildew fingers
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.440]  and let's defoliate any leaf that has got some frosting on it.
[20:39.440 --> 20:41.400]  Just go ahead and feel free to pull it off.
[20:41.400 --> 20:42.400]  Why not?
[20:42.400 --> 20:46.880]  Those leaves are contributing to the over humid condition in the room.
[20:46.880 --> 20:50.320]  Those leaves are where the powdery mildew is hiding.
[20:50.320 --> 20:53.960]  If there are no camping spots, there are no hippies camping.
[20:53.960 --> 20:55.580]  So get rid of the camping spots.
[20:55.580 --> 20:56.580]  You won't have spots.
[20:56.580 --> 20:58.640]  If there are no donuts, there's no powdered sugar, bro.
[20:58.640 --> 21:01.000]  Get rid of all those spots is really what I'm trying to say.
[21:01.000 --> 21:02.840]  So get rid of all that powdery mildew stuff.
[21:02.840 --> 21:04.840]  Put that in a trash bag.
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.840]  Burn the shit.
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  No, you don't have to burn it.
[21:06.840 --> 21:07.840]  Get rid of it.
[21:07.840 --> 21:08.840]  Put it in the trash.
[21:08.840 --> 21:09.840]  Get that stuff out of the grow as quickly as possible.
[21:09.840 --> 21:10.840]  Seal it up.
[21:10.840 --> 21:11.840]  Get it gone.
[21:11.840 --> 21:15.560]  Then, after we've defoliated, then spray at that point.
[21:15.560 --> 21:17.080]  Then spray the room.
[21:17.080 --> 21:20.880]  Follow the appropriate instructions on the container of whichever product you choose
[21:20.880 --> 21:21.880]  to spray.
[21:21.880 --> 21:26.400]  Keep in mind, if you spray indoors, add two hours to the reentry interval time because
[21:26.400 --> 21:29.040]  some of those products, you don't want to go in the room too early.
[21:29.080 --> 21:31.200]  You're expecting wind and sun to help break that down.
[21:31.200 --> 21:32.580]  You don't have that in the grow space.
[21:32.580 --> 21:33.960]  Add two hours.
[21:33.960 --> 21:36.240]  Then ventilate the room.
[21:36.240 --> 21:41.060]  If we are spraying for powdery mildew, these products, all of the products which I've listed,
[21:41.060 --> 21:43.980]  we don't need those to stay wet for very long.
[21:43.980 --> 21:46.840]  We want to hit the plant and get the plants dry.
[21:46.840 --> 21:52.120]  So don't put fans on them and dry them rapidly, but let's dry them naturally, slowly.
[21:52.120 --> 21:53.440]  Get ventilation in there.
[21:53.440 --> 21:54.680]  Get some air movement in there.
[21:54.680 --> 21:59.000]  We don't want hurricane-like conditions, but we want some movement, some airflow.
[21:59.000 --> 22:02.920]  We don't want crazy fucking rustling leaves, but we want movement on the leaves.
[22:02.920 --> 22:05.920]  We want them rustling and not fucking ... We don't want them jostling and not rustling.
[22:05.920 --> 22:07.480]  You know what I'm saying, right?
[22:07.480 --> 22:09.640]  Don't fucking go in there and destroy the grow now.
[22:09.640 --> 22:12.440]  Just go in there and blow around a little bit and get it dry.
[22:12.440 --> 22:14.300]  Blow dry its hair just a little tiny bit.
[22:14.300 --> 22:18.160]  Get it cleaned up, but don't give it an opportunity to build mildew with the moisture you just
[22:18.160 --> 22:20.160]  fucking sprayed in there.
[22:20.160 --> 22:25.560]  Most of the products I mentioned, definitely the peroxide, the H2O2 and the Xerotol.
[22:25.560 --> 22:29.080]  You can spray those three the day of harvest.
[22:29.080 --> 22:31.160]  You could spray those all the way up to harvest.
[22:31.160 --> 22:35.360]  We're going to do a bud wash with those anyway, so don't be afraid to use those all the way
[22:35.360 --> 22:36.800]  up to the very end.
[22:36.800 --> 22:40.320]  Cease and double nickel, you can use those quite late in flower.
[22:40.320 --> 22:42.280]  They're not going to disrupt the flavor of your buds.
[22:42.280 --> 22:44.440]  They're not going to cause any problems with your product.
[22:44.440 --> 22:46.080]  I think those will work well.
[22:46.080 --> 22:49.720]  The Regalia and Grandivo, I can't testify to using those very late.
[22:49.720 --> 22:53.180]  I would use those very early in flower if it were up to me.
[22:53.180 --> 22:54.720]  So we're going to defoliate.
[22:54.720 --> 22:55.720]  We're going to spray.
[22:55.720 --> 22:56.720]  We're going to ventilate the room.
[22:56.720 --> 22:58.200]  We're going to get the room dry.
[22:58.200 --> 23:01.440]  While we're doing this, we're going to wear a mask and gloves.
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.000]  We're also going to put on some good music and spread some good vibes.
[23:05.000 --> 23:08.820]  Then spray when the lights are off or the sun is down.
[23:08.820 --> 23:10.320]  Don't spray with the lights on.
[23:10.320 --> 23:11.380]  Don't spray with the sun up.
[23:11.380 --> 23:13.960]  This will cause you some problems.
[23:13.960 --> 23:17.980]  A lot of little boys remember burning ants with the magnifying glass or doing some ... Maybe
[23:17.980 --> 23:18.980]  you burned leaves.
[23:18.980 --> 23:21.920]  I don't know what you burned, but we did some experiments in science class when we were
[23:21.920 --> 23:22.920]  kids.
[23:22.920 --> 23:25.240]  You could spray with the magnifying glass and the sun would hit it just right.
[23:25.240 --> 23:28.400]  You could move that fucker around and you could catch shit on fire.
[23:28.400 --> 23:31.960]  Just think about the grow light or the sun hitting a little droplet.
[23:31.960 --> 23:36.220]  Those grow lights are super close to your plants in some cases, especially some of those
[23:36.220 --> 23:37.280]  new LEDs.
[23:37.280 --> 23:39.300]  I've seen plants get little burns from it.
[23:39.300 --> 23:40.940]  Some people say it doesn't happen.
[23:40.940 --> 23:42.560]  Some people say it's impossible.
[23:42.560 --> 23:43.640]  I think it's very likely.
[23:43.640 --> 23:46.020]  I think I've seen it happen in a grow.
[23:46.020 --> 23:51.560]  So spray when the lights are off or when the sun is down if possible, please.
[23:51.560 --> 23:52.560]  All right.
[23:53.200 --> 23:58.080]  I think that covers my recap of treating powdery mildew, some stuff that I should have talked
[23:58.080 --> 23:59.400]  about in the last episode.
[23:59.400 --> 24:02.600]  Honestly, the main thing, you guys, is to correct the room.
[24:02.600 --> 24:04.600]  Have some sort of monitors in there.
[24:04.600 --> 24:06.520]  Oh, another thing.
[24:06.520 --> 24:09.620]  The products I listed, nobody's paying me to talk about those products.
[24:09.620 --> 24:15.000]  Nobody pays me to talk about Cease Double Nickel, Regalia, Grandivo, H2O2, Xerotal.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.520]  Nobody paid me for any of that.
[24:17.520 --> 24:18.880]  That's something important that I think I should say.
[24:18.880 --> 24:20.400]  I was on the track to saying something else.
[24:20.400 --> 24:21.720]  I don't even know what the fuck it was.
[24:21.880 --> 24:25.920]  The most important part, have some monitors in there so that you know what's happening.
[24:25.920 --> 24:26.920]  Is it too humid in there?
[24:26.920 --> 24:27.920]  Is it too hot in there?
[24:27.920 --> 24:32.240]  I don't care if you use a pulse monitor, if you use a PL Grow unit, a Minder unit.
[24:32.240 --> 24:35.200]  I don't care if you got a little kid in there taking notes.
[24:35.200 --> 24:36.760]  I do care if you put a little kid in there.
[24:36.760 --> 24:37.760]  All right.
[24:37.760 --> 24:38.760]  Let's be real.
[24:38.760 --> 24:43.560]  Maybe if you have an adult that's paid hourly on a living wage and is giving meal breaks,
[24:43.560 --> 24:47.340]  if they're in there, if you've got a helper monkey in there that's reading a thermometer
[24:47.340 --> 24:51.340]  and writing down the hourly notes and just keeping track of it, have some way of knowing
[24:51.960 --> 24:53.800]  what's going on in your grow when you're not there.
[24:53.800 --> 24:55.420]  Are you using a PL Minder unit?
[24:55.420 --> 24:57.780]  Are you using a pulse monitor unit?
[24:57.780 --> 25:00.780]  What do you have in there letting you know what the conditions are like when you are
[25:00.780 --> 25:01.860]  away?
[25:01.860 --> 25:05.980]  Are there drastic humidity or temperature changes during your nighttime cycle?
[25:05.980 --> 25:10.420]  Are there drastic heat spikes or humidity spikes during your daytime cycle?
[25:10.420 --> 25:12.340]  Is something going awry at a switch?
[25:12.340 --> 25:16.580]  That's where things really go weird is when you flip from day to night or night to day
[25:16.580 --> 25:20.480]  is when you see drastic temperature and humidity fluctuations.
[25:20.620 --> 25:25.960]  Those are the things that are going to cause, trigger, influence, and continue perpetuate
[25:25.960 --> 25:28.160]  your powdery mildew situation.
[25:28.160 --> 25:30.720]  Have something in there letting you know what is going on.
[25:30.720 --> 25:36.400]  You might not even know that it's getting 90% humidity right when the lights go off.
[25:36.400 --> 25:40.920]  Maybe you need to get a blower or an extractor fan and hook that up and that way when the
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.800]  lights go off, that can run for 30 minutes or they sell another device that plugs into
[25:45.800 --> 25:46.840]  the wall.
[25:46.840 --> 25:48.880]  This piece itself plugs into the wall.
[25:48.880 --> 25:49.880]  It's got a meter on it.
[25:50.280 --> 25:54.080]  You tell it when it hits whatever percent humidity, you set it to a meter and when it
[25:54.080 --> 25:57.320]  hits that percent, it triggers on and the power comes on.
[25:57.320 --> 25:59.200]  You just plug your exhaust fan into that.
[25:59.200 --> 26:01.160]  You hang the sensor in the middle of the room.
[26:01.160 --> 26:04.920]  When it hits 70% humidity, this thing goes, I'm supposed to turn on.
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.920]  It powers electricity to your extraction fan and it sucks out some humidity until that
[26:08.920 --> 26:11.480]  sensor says, oh, it's 69% humidity.
[26:11.480 --> 26:13.800]  I can turn off because he wants it at 70.
[26:13.800 --> 26:16.000]  That thing clicks off and it keeps you at 70 or below.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  You could set it at whatever you want.
[26:18.000 --> 26:21.120]  Most of the time those are a cap switch or something similar to that.
[26:21.120 --> 26:22.500]  Maybe that is your solution.
[26:22.500 --> 26:25.600]  Maybe a dehumidifier on the same type of switch.
[26:25.600 --> 26:26.600]  Maybe both.
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.280]  There are a lot of options for fixing humidity and powdery mildew, but the main thing is
[26:31.280 --> 26:33.760]  correct the room and how do you know if something's wrong in the room?
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.440]  Well, we know because we've got powdery mildew, but how do we know when and how to correct
[26:37.440 --> 26:39.600]  it if we don't have some kind of meter?
[26:39.600 --> 26:42.920]  If you want to win your battle with powdery mildew, the first thing to do is to fix the
[26:42.920 --> 26:43.920]  room.
[26:43.920 --> 26:47.600]  I would recommend some sort of monitoring device to monitoring device to let you know
[26:48.200 --> 26:49.560]  what is going on in that room.
[26:49.560 --> 26:52.000]  It doesn't have to be something super expensive.
[26:52.000 --> 26:56.720]  Of course, like a PL Grow Minder unit, a pulse monitor, something in that same realm would
[26:56.720 --> 27:01.080]  be beautiful, would be excellent, or you can get one of those hygrometers, thermometers
[27:01.080 --> 27:03.040]  with the ... It just keeps records for you.
[27:03.040 --> 27:05.280]  It shows you what the high and what the low was.
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.520]  Those will work, but how do you know when that happened?
[27:09.520 --> 27:13.240]  Something a little more high tech that you can keep some data would be ideal, but get
[27:13.240 --> 27:17.000]  what's in your budget and get what is within your technical means.
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.200]  I understand some people are not highly technical these days.
[27:20.200 --> 27:23.640]  Some of us just want to go in the garden and get dirt under our nails and grow weed.
[27:23.640 --> 27:25.880]  Don't want to worry about too much monitors and stuff.
[27:25.880 --> 27:30.160]  Get what you're comfortable with because we do need to know what is going on in the grow.
[27:30.160 --> 27:34.760]  All right, I think that wraps up my powdery mildew recap section of this podcast.
[27:34.760 --> 27:37.700]  I do have a couple of great questions here in front of me.
[27:37.700 --> 27:42.920]  This message came from our friend Fat Ankle Foot, and it goes a little bit like this.
[27:42.920 --> 27:46.000]  It says, hey, Ross DeJeff, thank you for all you do.
[27:46.000 --> 27:50.700]  I have a question on reading the pesticide labels correctly.
[27:50.700 --> 27:51.960]  That is always a good question.
[27:51.960 --> 27:59.520]  It says, first off, is an indoor grow facility considered a greenhouse, a nursery, or neither?
[27:59.520 --> 28:00.720]  I'm not an expert on that part.
[28:00.720 --> 28:04.960]  I guess I've been trained by the Department of Ag, and I never asked that question.
[28:04.960 --> 28:10.920]  I think when they wrote the pesticide bottles, I honestly don't think they have indoor cultivation
[28:10.920 --> 28:11.920]  in mind.
[28:11.920 --> 28:18.960]  That's why I always add that disclaimer to add two hours to your re-entry interval time
[28:18.960 --> 28:22.520]  because it is a little bit different than all of the above.
[28:22.520 --> 28:24.360]  It's new.
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.440]  They didn't expect us to put a bunch of lights in a warehouse, so I don't think those companies
[28:28.440 --> 28:32.680]  thought of that when they wrote those labels, which I'm going to get off on a side tangent
[28:32.680 --> 28:33.680]  here.
[28:33.680 --> 28:37.520]  That caused a lot of controversy when it came to deciding which pesticides we could use
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.440]  in Colorado because there are a lot of weird things written on those bottles, and none
[28:42.440 --> 28:45.640]  of the stuff specified what could be smoked.
[28:45.640 --> 28:48.500]  None of it was designed for smokable products, really.
[28:48.500 --> 28:50.640]  Some of it probably was stuff for tobacco and things.
[28:50.640 --> 28:52.600]  None of it was designed for cannabis.
[28:52.600 --> 28:57.240]  We had to develop rules here with the Department of Ag and the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement
[28:57.240 --> 29:02.040]  Division and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and citizens, and
[29:02.040 --> 29:08.080]  growers, and cultivators, and industry leaders, and all kinds of people got together and made
[29:08.080 --> 29:11.920]  a bunch of rules on what pesticides and what the fundamentals of what pesticides would
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.480]  be allowed in commercial production.
[29:14.480 --> 29:15.560]  Those rules didn't exist.
[29:15.560 --> 29:17.720]  They had to create those rules.
[29:17.720 --> 29:20.740]  I could be completely wrong that you're indoor grow.
[29:20.740 --> 29:24.000]  It sounds like a nursery to me, but when I think of nursery, I'm thinking outdoors with
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  a lot of air flow.
[29:25.000 --> 29:28.900]  There's a couple of nurseries in my neighborhood, and they don't look anything like any indoor
[29:28.900 --> 29:30.760]  commercial environment I've ever been in.
[29:31.200 --> 29:34.280]  I'm going to say it's not any of those, dude.
[29:34.280 --> 29:35.760]  It's indoor.
[29:35.760 --> 29:38.520]  Is indoor considered a greenhouse or nursery or neither?
[29:38.520 --> 29:39.960]  I guess neither is going to be my answer.
[29:39.960 --> 29:42.520]  It's kind of a hybrid, dude.
[29:42.520 --> 29:43.920]  Like I said, they didn't expect this.
[29:43.920 --> 29:45.800]  This is a whole new thing.
[29:45.800 --> 29:50.880]  Those pesticides were written before indoor cannabis cultivation.
[29:50.880 --> 29:54.800]  Before they were allowed to discuss indoor cannabis cultivation, they knew it was happening.
[29:54.800 --> 29:57.360]  They knew we were going to use it, but they were just like, what do you mean they grow
[29:57.360 --> 29:58.360]  weed with this?
[29:58.600 --> 30:02.240]  They just acted totally like it wasn't happening because they couldn't be involved.
[30:02.240 --> 30:06.400]  That's a really good question, and I wish I had more of an educated answer to that,
[30:06.400 --> 30:11.040]  but honestly, I don't think they had indoor cultivation in mind when they started writing
[30:11.040 --> 30:12.440]  pesticide labels.
[30:12.440 --> 30:15.520]  Maybe they do now, but I don't think they did then.
[30:15.520 --> 30:16.520]  Now, there's more to this.
[30:16.520 --> 30:21.600]  It says, my boss and I are having disagreements on your evergreen information.
[30:21.600 --> 30:23.040]  Would you be able to clarify this?
[30:23.040 --> 30:24.440]  I hope so, buddy.
[30:24.440 --> 30:25.680]  Let's try not to get you fired.
[30:25.680 --> 30:29.400]  Let's get you a raise and leave everybody as friends at the end of this.
[30:29.400 --> 30:30.800]  Would you be able to clarify this?
[30:30.800 --> 30:32.200]  Yes, I will do my best.
[30:32.200 --> 30:38.100]  It says, I'm trying to use the evergreen concentrate product on our plants.
[30:38.100 --> 30:40.160]  We have a root aphid problem.
[30:40.160 --> 30:41.160]  That's going to work.
[30:41.160 --> 30:50.440]  It says, my boss says we would only be able to use one ounce per 2,460 square feet because
[30:50.440 --> 30:54.640]  on the inside of the pesticide label, it does recommend and limit how much you should use
[30:54.640 --> 30:58.200]  per square foot when you are applying this pesticide.
[30:58.200 --> 31:03.320]  But what they are talking about is a canopy size space.
[31:03.320 --> 31:07.080]  You are treating the root zone, which is a completely different ballgame, a different
[31:07.080 --> 31:09.520]  plan of attack, a different method.
[31:09.520 --> 31:11.840]  You're playing by different rules, doing a different thing.
[31:11.840 --> 31:14.080]  They're talking about the rules of baseball.
[31:14.080 --> 31:15.080]  We're playing football.
[31:15.080 --> 31:16.280]  They're talking about leaf ball.
[31:16.280 --> 31:17.840]  We're playing dirt ball here.
[31:17.840 --> 31:20.920]  Let's change the rules a little bit, but I do want to continue with reading.
[31:20.920 --> 31:26.400]  It says, my boss says we can only use one ounce per 2,460 square feet.
[31:26.400 --> 31:29.000]  We would be drenching into five gallon pots.
[31:29.000 --> 31:30.120]  You're going to need a lot.
[31:30.120 --> 31:31.120]  It goes on.
[31:31.120 --> 31:36.880]  It says 15 milliliters per gallon at 150 gallons is 50 ounces.
[31:36.880 --> 31:39.960]  Also, how does square footage translate when using pots?
[31:39.960 --> 31:41.120]  It doesn't.
[31:41.120 --> 31:42.840]  This is two totally different things.
[31:42.840 --> 31:48.520]  That 2,460 square feet that you guys were talking about, that is canopy space.
[31:48.520 --> 31:49.860]  This is root zone space.
[31:49.860 --> 31:50.860]  This is a different thing.
[31:51.800 --> 31:52.900]  You're not spray applying.
[31:52.900 --> 31:54.380]  You are mixing as a soil dredge.
[31:54.380 --> 31:58.780]  This is a different thing, a different application, a different purpose, a different use, a different
[31:58.780 --> 32:00.500]  plan of attack.
[32:00.500 --> 32:02.540]  While I'm on that ramble, do both.
[32:02.540 --> 32:06.220]  When you were doing the soil dredge, also do a foliar spray.
[32:06.220 --> 32:07.380]  Just hit both.
[32:07.380 --> 32:10.020]  That way, any bugs that are living down in the roots, they're going to try to climb up
[32:10.020 --> 32:13.020]  into your bush, into your canopy.
[32:13.020 --> 32:14.180]  That way, you've already hit there too.
[32:14.180 --> 32:15.180]  They have nowhere to go.
[32:15.180 --> 32:17.940]  Anything that's living in the bushy canopy part, it's going to move right back down into
[32:17.940 --> 32:18.940]  the soil.
[32:18.940 --> 32:20.220]  They're going to go, fuck it, sucks here.
[32:20.580 --> 32:21.580]  They're just going to die or move.
[32:21.580 --> 32:25.380]  They're going to pack up and get the fuck out of there.
[32:25.380 --> 32:26.660]  It doesn't translate.
[32:26.660 --> 32:30.980]  To the best of my knowledge, best of my ability, best of my training, there's no translation.
[32:30.980 --> 32:32.260]  It's two different things.
[32:32.260 --> 32:34.020]  It says, I hope the message is clear.
[32:34.020 --> 32:35.980]  Yeah, the message is clear.
[32:35.980 --> 32:40.740]  This was a very good ... I hope this was a very good conversation between your boss and
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.620]  whoever else was involved in this conversation.
[32:42.620 --> 32:44.220]  It does say there's three people here.
[32:44.220 --> 32:45.740]  I hope this was very friendly.
[32:45.740 --> 32:49.020]  I hope I contributed some useful information.
[32:49.020 --> 32:50.020]  It's not a greenhouse.
[32:50.820 --> 32:51.820]  It's not a nursery.
[32:51.820 --> 32:52.820]  It's an indoor grow facility.
[32:52.820 --> 32:56.380]  I really don't think they had that in mind when they wrote your rules.
[32:56.380 --> 32:58.340]  Then, how does it translate?
[32:58.340 --> 33:00.060]  It does, and it's two different things.
[33:00.060 --> 33:05.860]  Go ahead and do your root drench at the recommended rate of 15 mils per gallon, but also do a
[33:05.860 --> 33:10.340]  spray around the same dosage up top also at the same time.
[33:10.340 --> 33:14.700]  Fatanklefoot wraps up the message by saying, the first rule for using pesticides is read
[33:14.700 --> 33:15.980]  the fucking label.
[33:15.980 --> 33:20.860]  The problem is, the problem we face here was three people read the label and we've got
[33:20.860 --> 33:22.740]  three different answers.
[33:22.740 --> 33:27.220]  I do appreciate that there was a good debate in that grow space, in that office space.
[33:27.220 --> 33:28.740]  I hope I have solved the problem.
[33:28.740 --> 33:31.580]  I hope I have given you some useful information.
[33:31.580 --> 33:34.540]  I'm glad that there was a great debate, and I'm glad you guys are talking.
[33:34.540 --> 33:37.780]  That means there's some educated, smart people in there.
[33:37.780 --> 33:38.780]  Nobody was right.
[33:38.780 --> 33:41.660]  Nobody was wrong, but let me know who was right and who was wrong.
[33:41.660 --> 33:46.700]  I do appreciate that three people in that cultivation read the pesticide booklet, because
[33:46.700 --> 33:51.300]  that means that it's probably three more people read that pesticide booklet than a lot of
[33:51.300 --> 33:53.700]  cultivation facilities, unfortunately.
[33:53.700 --> 33:56.140]  I'm proud and excited that you guys did that.
[33:56.140 --> 33:57.380]  Good job, fist bump.
[33:57.380 --> 34:01.380]  Big iry army salute to everybody for reading that pesticide book.
[34:01.380 --> 34:03.260]  All right, I think I wrapped up this message.
[34:03.260 --> 34:06.300]  I do have another one I want to get to, and I'm quite rambly.
[34:06.300 --> 34:10.180]  This one ends up with thanks and hugs from Fatanklefoot.
[34:10.900 --> 34:14.260]  Big thanks, big hugs, big iry army fist bump.
[34:14.260 --> 34:16.260]  I want to make sure I got everything.
[34:16.260 --> 34:19.740]  Spray and drench to win were the main notes that I wrote down.
[34:19.740 --> 34:22.340]  All right, let's segue right into the next message.
[34:22.340 --> 34:25.020]  This one came from Jbags.
[34:25.020 --> 34:27.140]  This one came from the Iry Genetics website.
[34:27.140 --> 34:28.140]  That's right.
[34:28.140 --> 34:31.180]  On the Iry Genetics website, there is a grow help tab.
[34:31.180 --> 34:35.400]  If you click on the tab that says grow help, it will go to the grow help tab that asks
[34:35.400 --> 34:37.980]  you several preliminary questions.
[34:37.980 --> 34:44.100]  It asks what name to use, what strain you're using or growing, if you're using LEDs, HPS
[34:44.100 --> 34:47.620]  lights, if you're growing indoors or outdoors, what kind of medium you're using.
[34:47.620 --> 34:51.220]  It asks you all kinds of useful questions to help me help you out.
[34:51.220 --> 34:53.820]  Jbags filled out all of those questions.
[34:53.820 --> 34:57.820]  We don't need to talk about a lot of that stuff because he has a great question that
[34:57.820 --> 35:00.580]  a lot of the other stuff won't matter, so we're going to skip all of his environmental
[35:00.580 --> 35:02.220]  stuff and get to the point.
[35:02.220 --> 35:03.700]  It says, the problem.
[35:03.700 --> 35:07.020]  I don't really have a problem, more so of a question.
[35:07.060 --> 35:09.180]  That's good, bro, because I have got answers.
[35:09.180 --> 35:11.380]  It says, I live in the Northeast.
[35:11.380 --> 35:15.100]  My state allows me to have 12 plants of any stage for my wife and I.
[35:15.100 --> 35:19.540]  I typically clone every plant I grow just in case I find a keeper.
[35:19.540 --> 35:24.520]  Yes, I always preach to take a clone of every plant in case you find that gem.
[35:24.520 --> 35:25.520]  You need it again.
[35:25.520 --> 35:28.180]  You don't want to be heartbroken that you found the beauty of your dreams and she got
[35:28.180 --> 35:29.180]  away.
[35:29.180 --> 35:31.460]  There will always be a story you tell.
[35:31.460 --> 35:32.460]  It goes on.
[35:32.460 --> 35:36.380]  It says, although I also like to grow perpetually using 410s.
[35:36.420 --> 35:39.260]  He explains a little bit of his perpetual cycle.
[35:39.260 --> 35:40.740]  He describes his grow quite a bit.
[35:40.740 --> 35:43.260]  He talks about his perpetual system.
[35:43.260 --> 35:47.740]  Then we get to the part here that says, I've got so many good seeds at the moment.
[35:47.740 --> 35:51.500]  I would like to stop cloning everything and keep growing from seeds.
[35:51.500 --> 35:57.420]  Then when I find a keeper, my plan is to revege for those clones, which does make good sense.
[35:57.420 --> 36:02.460]  I've done that a couple of times because myself, I am limited on plant count.
[36:02.460 --> 36:07.780]  You just flower it out, cut down most of the buds, revege that bad dog, cut a clone
[36:07.780 --> 36:09.900]  off of it, throw that original plant away.
[36:09.900 --> 36:10.900]  Your plant count never changed.
[36:10.900 --> 36:13.580]  It went from one to one still with that same plant.
[36:13.580 --> 36:14.580]  It was a big plant.
[36:14.580 --> 36:15.820]  Now it's a clone.
[36:15.820 --> 36:18.220]  It does sound like you have a sound strategy.
[36:18.220 --> 36:20.180]  That is the way that a lot of people do it.
[36:20.180 --> 36:24.260]  You grow it out, cut it down, revege, cut a clone, start fresh with it.
[36:24.260 --> 36:25.260]  That does make sense.
[36:25.260 --> 36:28.420]  Now here's where we get to the anomaly of this process.
[36:28.420 --> 36:34.900]  It says, due to the limited space, can I cut down the root ball of a mature, freshly
[36:34.900 --> 36:37.460]  harvested plant in order to revege?
[36:37.460 --> 36:42.220]  Then he describes in detail, meaning I flower in five to seven gallon pots.
[36:42.220 --> 36:46.540]  Can I trim the root ball to fit into a two gallon pot with a little bit of fresh cocoa
[36:46.540 --> 36:51.220]  and worm castings, then begin that revege process?
[36:51.220 --> 36:55.220]  I'm familiar with the revege process because I've done it successfully in the past.
[36:55.220 --> 36:57.660]  I always kept them in very large pots.
[36:57.900 --> 36:59.420]  Yeah, I think that will work.
[36:59.420 --> 37:01.660]  You're going to have to trim down a lot of the plant.
[37:01.660 --> 37:03.780]  Don't leave a lot of the plant for your reveging.
[37:03.780 --> 37:08.500]  Just have two or three, maybe four or five little thumb sized nuggets that you're reveging.
[37:08.500 --> 37:09.500]  Don't leave a lot.
[37:09.500 --> 37:10.760]  This should work.
[37:10.760 --> 37:15.480]  It may take a little bit longer for this plant to revege, but it should work.
[37:15.480 --> 37:19.660]  It goes on to say, it would be nice if I can keep them in smaller pots long enough to snag
[37:19.660 --> 37:22.340]  a couple of clones, then kill off this mom.
[37:22.340 --> 37:23.340]  I know that's harsh.
[37:23.340 --> 37:24.420]  No, that's how it works.
[37:24.420 --> 37:25.860]  It says, but she had it coming.
[37:25.860 --> 37:26.860]  Yeah, she did.
[37:26.860 --> 37:28.900]  It had it coming from the beginning and she should have known.
[37:28.900 --> 37:29.900]  I'm just playing.
[37:29.900 --> 37:34.100]  It goes on to say, I dig the podcast and the help you have given me via Instagram.
[37:34.100 --> 37:36.340]  Then he wraps it up with his Instagram name.
[37:36.340 --> 37:39.500]  I'm not sure if he wants that said here on the podcast.
[37:39.500 --> 37:41.860]  Respect, if you want that said, sorry, I didn't say it.
[37:41.860 --> 37:44.740]  I didn't want to get you blasted because there's no way to take it back once I do say it.
[37:44.740 --> 37:45.740]  I can't correct it.
[37:45.740 --> 37:48.220]  It says, by the way, I know my humidity is high.
[37:48.220 --> 37:49.860]  I'm working on that in my grow.
[37:49.860 --> 37:51.500]  Yeah, but that's okay.
[37:51.500 --> 37:54.260]  No stress on the ... No judgment on the environment, bro.
[37:54.260 --> 37:57.580]  That has been 108 degrees here.
[37:57.580 --> 38:01.900]  My environment is not correct either, but we struggle, we adjust, we adapt, we do what
[38:01.900 --> 38:02.900]  we can do.
[38:02.900 --> 38:03.900]  No shame in your game, brother.
[38:03.900 --> 38:04.900]  Do what you're doing.
[38:04.900 --> 38:05.900]  I get it.
[38:05.900 --> 38:06.900]  I get it.
[38:06.900 --> 38:07.900]  Life is rough right now.
[38:07.900 --> 38:11.820]  It was 108 degrees today and then in like seven to 10 days, I'm going to be wearing
[38:11.820 --> 38:12.820]  a hoodie every day.
[38:12.820 --> 38:16.100]  That's the kind of shit we're growing with right now.
[38:16.100 --> 38:18.540]  Let me make sure I wrapped up all of this stuff here.
[38:18.540 --> 38:21.540]  Okay, there was one thing I did want to kind of recap and mention here.
[38:21.540 --> 38:22.860]  Your strategy is going to work.
[38:22.860 --> 38:25.280]  You're going to cut down that root ball real small.
[38:25.280 --> 38:28.580]  Also make the plant real small when you do that, so there's not a lot to support there.
[38:28.580 --> 38:32.140]  It'd be much better if you could have a bigger root zone.
[38:32.140 --> 38:35.620]  Let me give you a suggestion on possibly how to do that.
[38:35.620 --> 38:39.740]  Now, I do understand that you are crammed for space and I do understand that you're
[38:39.740 --> 38:40.900]  crammed for plant count.
[38:40.900 --> 38:45.740]  I also know you've got a perpetual grow, so I don't know how well this will work for you.
[38:45.740 --> 38:47.780]  Maybe you've got a veg space.
[38:47.780 --> 38:52.220]  This may actually free up some space in your flower room if my idea works for you and if
[38:52.580 --> 38:54.460]  you understand where I'm headed with this.
[38:54.460 --> 39:00.820]  I have done a full podcast on returning our plants to 18-6 of lighting schedule right
[39:00.820 --> 39:07.220]  before harvest, so about 14 days at the most, maybe 10, 7 days before you harvest during
[39:07.220 --> 39:09.020]  the flush phase if you flush.
[39:09.020 --> 39:11.020]  That's also controversial now.
[39:11.020 --> 39:16.500]  During the flush phase, I talk about turning the plants to a longer light cycle, an 18-6
[39:16.500 --> 39:19.220]  cycle, basically a vegetative cycle.
[39:19.220 --> 39:20.860]  There's a reason for this.
[39:20.860 --> 39:23.660]  Light is the number one energy source for our plants.
[39:23.660 --> 39:24.660]  It triggers photosynthesis.
[39:24.660 --> 39:26.900]  It makes everything happen.
[39:26.900 --> 39:29.740]  Let's give it as much light as possible at the end.
[39:29.740 --> 39:32.980]  People are going to say that we'll make my plants go back into veg.
[39:32.980 --> 39:37.940]  Probably, but we're going to harvest in like 10 days and we're not going to see any reveg
[39:37.940 --> 39:42.740]  for at least 14 days and you can cut them down and smoke them and enjoy them anyway.
[39:42.740 --> 39:47.980]  If you plan on reveging, you can get ahead of the game by putting your light cycle back
[39:47.980 --> 39:55.860]  on 18-6, 7 to 10, maybe 12 to 14 days before you intend to harvest these plants.
[39:55.860 --> 40:00.100]  If they do begin to revege, cut them down right away, but you'll notice they may finish
[40:00.100 --> 40:01.260]  a little bit early.
[40:01.260 --> 40:05.420]  They may finish a little bit beefier because you're giving them more light, more energy
[40:05.420 --> 40:06.420]  right at the end.
[40:06.420 --> 40:11.140]  A lot of cannabis plants decide to bulk up and beef up at the end of the flowering phase.
[40:11.140 --> 40:14.580]  Imagine if you give them a little push, a little steroids right at the end.
[40:14.580 --> 40:17.420]  When you normally cut the nutrients, now you're going to give them more light and they're
[40:17.420 --> 40:18.420]  going to go shebang.
[40:18.420 --> 40:24.100]  You're going to get possibly a bigger, heavier, beefier harvest by giving them a little bit
[40:24.100 --> 40:25.100]  more light.
[40:25.100 --> 40:29.100]  Possibly also, they may finish a little bit sooner.
[40:29.100 --> 40:34.260]  If you can, return your plants to a vegetative light cycle.
[40:34.260 --> 40:38.560]  Maybe put them, you've got a perpetual grow, so you can't put that room on 12-12.
[40:38.560 --> 40:43.460]  Maybe you can drag these plants you intend on harvesting back into your flowering space
[40:43.620 --> 40:49.980]  and get your next flowering run in there seven to 10 days earlier and revege that plant.
[40:49.980 --> 40:51.260]  That may help you out.
[40:51.260 --> 40:55.620]  That's just an idea, just something that I wouldn't be a friend and wouldn't be a bro
[40:55.620 --> 41:00.260]  and wouldn't be a pro if I didn't add on to your question.
[41:00.260 --> 41:02.300]  Think about the 18-6 at the end.
[41:02.300 --> 41:06.780]  That may be the trick that may help you out, that'll speed up the process.
[41:06.780 --> 41:10.660]  Then you won't need to put it into the other pot because you could just cut down most of
[41:10.820 --> 41:15.260]  it and it's only going to be a little bit away after that to get it back into the vegetative
[41:15.260 --> 41:16.260]  state.
[41:16.260 --> 41:18.700]  Yeah, I hope that helps you out.
[41:18.700 --> 41:20.300]  Give me a follow-up.
[41:20.300 --> 41:22.140]  Let me know which method you decided to do.
[41:22.140 --> 41:23.740]  Let me know if you went for the 18-6.
[41:23.740 --> 41:25.020]  I do love follow-ups.
[41:25.020 --> 41:29.540]  Anybody out there, if you sent me a question and I've helped you out, I would love a follow-up.
[41:29.540 --> 41:32.340]  My bro, you did not put ... Let's see, you did say whose name you want.
[41:32.340 --> 41:33.340]  It's up here.
[41:33.340 --> 41:36.180]  Jbags, thank you for the great question, bro.
[41:36.180 --> 41:37.700]  I did not say your Instagram name.
[41:37.700 --> 41:39.300]  I do apologize for that.
[41:39.300 --> 41:43.140]  Send me a message if you want a shout-out for your Instagram on the show.
