[00:16.960 --> 00:21.640]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 256 of the
[00:21.640 --> 00:25.600]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. Your source for cannabis news, education, and
[00:25.600 --> 00:29.040]  conversation. That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional
[00:29.040 --> 00:32.640]  grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis
[00:32.640 --> 00:35.480]  activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of
[00:35.480 --> 00:40.600]  cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends call me
[00:40.600 --> 00:44.200]  Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:44.200 --> 00:47.120]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for
[00:47.120 --> 00:51.760]  letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire
[00:51.760 --> 00:58.360]  Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen, I also want to send a huge shout out to
[00:58.360 --> 01:02.000]  all my friends that just joined me on Instagram Live. That's right, I've been
[01:02.000 --> 01:05.720]  doing Instagram Live videos occasionally and it's a lot of fun. It puts me in the
[01:05.720 --> 01:08.720]  mood to do a podcast. It gives me some ideas, it gives me inspiration, it makes
[01:08.720 --> 01:12.480]  me conversational, it gets me started, and it's a great way for me to hang out
[01:12.480 --> 01:16.080]  and take a couple of dabs with my social media following. So shout out to
[01:16.080 --> 01:19.880]  everybody who is watching the Instagram Live video. I appreciate the support and
[01:19.880 --> 01:22.760]  interaction. If you're not following me on Instagram, make sure you check it out.
[01:22.760 --> 01:27.640]  It's Irie underscore genetics, I-R-I-E underscore genetics on Instagram. That
[01:27.640 --> 01:31.400]  way you can join us and watch the live videos. You can participate, you can
[01:31.400 --> 01:34.280]  comment, maybe I'll answer your questions on the video, maybe I'll answer your
[01:34.280 --> 01:39.320]  question on the podcast. I like to get inspired, so join us. Check me out there.
[01:39.400 --> 01:43.680]  While I was doing the Instagram video, I was taking some fat dabs of some, what do
[01:43.680 --> 01:47.360]  I have here, some Chem-4 from Concentrate Supply Company and I was
[01:47.360 --> 01:52.080]  dunking it into this delicious Chem-4. It's called sugar wax, but it was more
[01:52.080 --> 01:56.000]  like a slurry, more like a sap. I really appreciated the flavor of it. I dunked
[01:56.000 --> 01:59.880]  the Chem-4 shatter into the Chem-4 slurry and it made a really nice dab.
[01:59.880 --> 02:03.880]  It made a whole bunch of lung expansion and it got me, obviously, it got me super
[02:03.880 --> 02:08.280]  high and super chatty. So great work to our friends at Concentrate Supply
[02:08.280 --> 02:12.840]  Company for the excellent concentrates. Alright, I also want to give a huge
[02:12.840 --> 02:16.000]  shout out to our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Co. If you need some new seeds

[03:01.160 --> 03:05.200]  some reason you guys, Stitcher will not load episode 253. I have reposted it
[03:05.200 --> 03:09.680]  several different ways, different times, different methods, different plans of
[03:09.680 --> 03:13.800]  attack. I kind of know what I'm doing with my RSS feed and I cannot get Stitcher
[03:13.800 --> 03:18.920]  to load episode 253. I know people are gonna say change the file name. I changed
[03:18.920 --> 03:22.960]  that file name to something random and it still would not pick it up. I reposted
[03:22.960 --> 03:26.720]  it several different ways. iTunes would get it, PodFeed would get it, my website
[03:26.720 --> 03:30.520]  would get it, website would pick it up, but for some reason Stitcher just did
[03:30.520 --> 03:34.280]  not want to pick up number 253. I'm gonna wait. I emailed Stitcher. They
[03:34.280 --> 03:37.440]  always take forever to reply. Hey Stitcher, if you're listening, please help
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.400]  me out. One of my episodes won't load. I'm going to wait for them to reply.
[03:41.400 --> 03:44.840]  Hopefully they will say something back. I'll see if they can fix it. If they
[03:44.840 --> 03:49.480]  don't respond, I will go back to trying. I've been overwhelmed with stuff. For
[03:49.480 --> 03:52.720]  some reason the Throwback Thursday episode didn't appear as it should have
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.360]  today. This morning I had to go manually repost that at 4 20 p.m. today. I'm not
[03:57.360 --> 04:01.080]  sure what's going on with Stitcher. I do apologize. I will get it worked out.
[04:01.080 --> 04:05.360]  Everything will be fixed as soon as I can get them to reply. I'm on it you
[04:05.360 --> 04:08.560]  guys. I'm trying, but it's kind of a Stitcher thing. I don't know what else to
[04:08.560 --> 04:11.840]  do. I think it's their service because it works everywhere else. It works on my
[04:11.840 --> 04:15.480]  website, which isn't anything fancy. It shows up in iTunes, which is the main
[04:15.480 --> 04:20.300]  podcast server. It shows up in Podbean. It shows up in Podbay. It shows up in all
[04:20.300 --> 04:23.880]  the other podcast services, so I feel like it's got to be a Stitcher issue. So
[04:23.880 --> 04:27.520]  I apologize if you are a Stitcher listener. I can tell that I'm missing
[04:27.520 --> 04:32.560]  listens because my ranking is slipping. I'm usually at like a thousand or
[04:32.560 --> 04:35.360]  better. I'm usually somewhere between six hundred and a thousand in the rankings.
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.880]  I'm not anywhere near that right now, so I got to fix that. I got to get Stitcher
[04:40.880 --> 04:44.120]  fixed. I got to get everybody the information and knowledge that they need.
[04:44.120 --> 04:49.960]  People rely on me. I apologize. One thing I can do to get it going while Stitcher
[04:49.960 --> 04:53.220]  is messing up is I can make more YouTube videos. So I've posted several YouTube
[04:53.380 --> 04:57.220]  videos. Don't forget that like the first hundred and three, maybe one hundred and
[04:57.220 --> 05:01.380]  five YouTube videos are up on the Grow From Your Heart podcast YouTube channel.
[05:01.380 --> 05:04.420]  So if you're not subscribed to the YouTube channel, go check that out. The
[05:04.420 --> 05:08.820]  first 19 or 20 videos are on the old iGrow Culture channel, but there's a
[05:08.820 --> 05:13.300]  playlist on the Grow From Your Heart podcast channel. The first 19 or 20 are
[05:13.300 --> 05:16.700]  right there on that playlist. Click on the playlist. It'll get you there. Listen
[05:16.700 --> 05:22.020]  to the first 19 or 20. Then all the way up to like 103, 105 are all right there
[05:22.020 --> 05:25.460]  on the Grow From Your Heart podcast YouTube channel. I will keep updating it
[05:25.460 --> 05:29.020]  until I get caught up to current. It takes a little bit of time, but I just
[05:29.020 --> 05:32.340]  did some upgrades to my computer. I honestly did some downgrades. I just
[05:32.340 --> 05:35.660]  deleted a whole bunch of shit. Now the computer goes way faster. It's gonna work
[05:35.660 --> 05:39.600]  a lot better. So maybe now I can do more video editing a little more quickly. We'll
[05:39.600 --> 05:42.880]  get more videos up for you guys. That's what I can do when stuff fails. I can
[05:42.880 --> 05:47.020]  find new ways to try to compensate. But check out the YouTube channel. I would
[05:47.020 --> 05:51.300]  appreciate that. Alright guys, let's talk about cannabis. I've been rambling on for
[05:51.300 --> 05:55.260]  like five or six minutes and I haven't spoken much about cannabis. I try to keep
[05:55.260 --> 05:58.980]  you guys updated on my most recent breeding projects and I haven't spoken
[05:58.980 --> 06:04.020]  much about it on a couple of episodes. But I have got, I've got an Arise male in
[06:04.020 --> 06:08.460]  a room with several females. My goal right now is to make a few new crosses
[06:08.460 --> 06:11.620]  because I've been inspired and I've got a few new clones that I want to pollinate
[06:11.620 --> 06:15.100]  and make a few new things. I've got some great ideas. And I'm also going to
[06:15.100 --> 06:17.980]  replenish some seeds that I've got available commercially that are getting
[06:17.980 --> 06:22.140]  low in stock. So I've got some familiar plants and some new plants in the
[06:22.140 --> 06:26.260]  breeding room. Some of the familiar old stuff is like there's a Grateful Dog in
[06:26.260 --> 06:29.900]  there so that I can make more of the Morning Dew. There's a Prana in there so
[06:29.900 --> 06:33.180]  that, or a Flow in there so that I can make more Prana. There are a couple of
[06:33.180 --> 06:37.500]  Arise females in there so that I can make more Arise seeds. There's a Hell's
[06:37.500 --> 06:41.220]  OG in there so that I can make more of the Hellfire OG. But the new stuff that's
[06:41.220 --> 06:45.540]  in there is what has got me excited and probably you also. I put a Kosher Kush
[06:45.620 --> 06:50.100]  female in there that will be pollinated by the Arise. I'm not even gonna try to
[06:50.100 --> 06:53.660]  name that until I grow it out. If you've got name recommendations let me know.
[06:53.660 --> 06:57.940]  Some Jewish names would be cool because I call my male plant King Solomon and
[06:57.940 --> 07:01.500]  this is the Kosher Kush. There's gonna be some Jewish attachment to the name,
[07:01.500 --> 07:05.900]  maybe some Torah relations to the name. Let me know what you think. Also there's
[07:05.900 --> 07:10.200]  Strawberry Fields in there. There's also a Zach Haze in there. If you guys know
[07:10.200 --> 07:14.100]  anything about Zach Haze. That's a strawberry cough plant bred to the
[07:14.340 --> 07:18.580]  Killer Haze. Those were two of my friend Zach Haze's. His real name was Zach Haze
[07:18.580 --> 07:23.260]  you guys. The Zach Haze was bred for my friend Zach Haze who actually passed
[07:23.260 --> 07:26.980]  away of cystic fibrosis. He was a great young man. He was a great dude. He was a
[07:26.980 --> 07:30.300]  cannabis patient. He was a cannabis advocate and he was just a great dude
[07:30.300 --> 07:34.780]  all around. So the Zach Haze was bred for him. Our friends at Organtica got me a
[07:34.780 --> 07:39.180]  clone of that. Now I am putting pollen from my Arise on that and I will
[07:39.180 --> 07:42.620]  return a bunch of the seeds to our friends at Organtica and we will see
[07:42.620 --> 07:46.300]  what happens with that in the future. But it needs a cool name. So if you've
[07:46.300 --> 07:50.900]  got a cool name for Zach to Arise let me know now that you know the story. There's
[07:50.900 --> 07:54.380]  also Space Bitch Number 3. I bred Space Bitch Number 3. I don't think many
[07:54.380 --> 07:57.720]  people... I gave out a few clones of that a while back. I don't think anybody's got
[07:57.720 --> 08:03.720]  it alive still. Space Bitch Number 3 is of course Space Queen. Kind of a really
[08:03.720 --> 08:09.540]  pungent like a rotten mango fruity kind of smelling phenotype and I pollinated
[08:09.540 --> 08:12.780]  that with my Grateful Dog and that made Space Bitch Number 3. It was of course
[08:12.780 --> 08:16.340]  Number 3 because it was just the third seed that I planted in the line. I
[08:16.340 --> 08:20.460]  labeled the cups 1, 2, 3. I think I went up to number 8 and that was number 3.
[08:20.460 --> 08:23.480]  Number 3 and 4 were the keepers. 3 is the one that stuck around for the long
[08:23.480 --> 08:28.780]  time. Also there is Ecto Cooler in there. I cannot recall the cross on Ecto Cooler
[08:28.780 --> 08:31.980]  right now. It's got some DK in there. It's got some other cool stuff. Ecto Cooler
[08:31.980 --> 08:36.980]  was bred by Tierra Rojo. I expect some great shit to come from the Arise to
[08:36.980 --> 08:40.940]  Ecto Cooler. So that should be a fun cross to come up with the name for. If
[08:40.940 --> 08:44.260]  you can think of any names for Ecto Cooler to Arise, I'd love to hear your
[08:44.260 --> 08:49.060]  suggestions. Send your suggestions to me on Twitter, at GFYH podcast, or email them
[08:49.060 --> 08:52.820]  to me. It's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. I'd like to know what you
[08:52.820 --> 08:56.300]  think I should name those strains. But anyway, all of those girls are in the
[08:56.300 --> 09:00.300]  flowering room and the male is dumping pollen and it is just about pollen time.
[09:00.300 --> 09:04.180]  So probably when I'm done recording here, I'm gonna wrap up the dreadlocks in
[09:04.180 --> 09:07.120]  something real nice. I'm gonna put on different clothes and I'm gonna go in
[09:07.120 --> 09:09.580]  there and I'm gonna smack that male around and make sure he gets pollen. I'll
[09:09.580 --> 09:12.420]  turn off all the fans, turn off all the blowers so that I have a little bit of
[09:12.420 --> 09:15.780]  control over where the pollen goes. I'm gonna go smack that male so he shoots
[09:15.780 --> 09:18.820]  his dust everywhere. Give him a good shake and then I'm gonna take a bud off
[09:18.820 --> 09:21.980]  of him and just rub that one bud of male flowers all over a couple of females.
[09:21.980 --> 09:25.700]  I'm gonna make a whole bunch of seeds. The pollination is happening you guys.
[09:25.700 --> 09:30.940]  That's what I'm getting at. It is pollination time. I'm excited. We're just
[09:30.940 --> 09:34.860]  shy of 30 days into flower with these plants. That means in about 30-35 days
[09:34.860 --> 09:38.540]  ish, these seeds will be ready. That means I'll get to take them out. Once the
[09:38.540 --> 09:42.060]  plants dry up, I'll get to see what I have created. That's always the funnest
[09:42.060 --> 09:47.180]  part of breeding is seeing what you have created. So that's a great way to segue
[09:47.180 --> 09:51.540]  into the topic of this show you guys. I like to talk about breeding a lot and
[09:51.540 --> 09:54.660]  I'm known for a lot of my breeding projects and my breeding work and when
[09:54.660 --> 09:58.980]  people approach the subject of breeding, they seem to be overwhelmed. They seem to
[09:58.980 --> 10:02.820]  think that breeding is some sorcery, some magician's work. You guys, breeding
[10:02.820 --> 10:06.180]  is the most natural thing that cannabis plants can do. That's what they want to
[10:06.180 --> 10:11.300]  do. Growing cannabis plants without seeds is actually the trick. If you were able
[10:11.300 --> 10:15.700]  to produce cannabis that does not have seeds in it and that is quality and
[10:15.700 --> 10:20.700]  smokable, you yourself are able to make seeds for yourself. If you're looking to
[10:20.700 --> 10:24.620]  make a small batch of seeds, I'm gonna give you some advice on an idea that
[10:24.620 --> 10:28.300]  I've got. I have not perfected this. We're gonna work on this idea together. I am
[10:28.340 --> 10:31.860]  certain this would work for a small garden. We're gonna talk about what I
[10:31.860 --> 10:35.620]  have called single pot breeding and I feel like this could be a book but I
[10:35.620 --> 10:38.780]  want to give it to everybody right now for free because I love you guys and I
[10:38.780 --> 10:44.060]  think it's a wonderful idea. So here's a great way in one pot in one small space
[10:44.060 --> 10:48.140]  with one light for you to create enough seeds for yourself to play with and
[10:48.140 --> 10:51.060]  maybe share a few with your friends and that way you don't have to buy more
[10:51.060 --> 10:54.940]  seeds and you can start your own breeding projects and see that it's not
[10:55.300 --> 10:59.540]  wizardry, that it's something that you can do. If you've grown a crop to fruition,
[10:59.900 --> 11:02.820]  if you've made a plant live that whole nine or 10 weeks through a flowering
[11:02.820 --> 11:07.620]  cycle, you are able to breed seeds. If you've got a strong enough light, you are
[11:07.620 --> 11:12.580]  able to breed seeds. It's not that hard. So I am going to press pause. I'm going
[11:12.580 --> 11:15.140]  to clear my throat real quick. I'm going to take a couple of drinks. I'll probably
[11:15.140 --> 11:18.000]  take another dab and get my throat all choked up again, but I'm going to press
[11:18.000 --> 11:21.060]  pause for a second. I'm going to take a quick break and through the power of
[11:21.060 --> 11:24.380]  editing, I'll be back before you can blink and then we will talk about single
[11:24.420 --> 11:29.220]  pot breeding and how you can make enough seeds with one pot, with one light in
[11:29.220 --> 11:32.020]  one very small grow space. Stay tuned, you guys.
[11:33.740 --> 11:36.980]  All right, podcast world. I just noticed something funny while I was recording.
[11:36.980 --> 11:40.780]  Our friend Jesse sent me a message and he pointed out that there is a vendor who
[11:40.780 --> 11:46.940]  sells cannabis seeds online and he claims to have a bunch of irigenetic seeds that
[11:46.940 --> 11:50.100]  are honestly sold out and if he's got them, they're rare fucking collector's
[11:50.100 --> 11:52.940]  items and you might want to get on there, but I know that they're not what he
[11:52.940 --> 11:56.220]  claims they are because those are simply not available. He's way too late
[11:56.220 --> 11:59.860]  to have those. Those probably don't even exist anymore anywhere. This guy claims
[11:59.860 --> 12:03.820]  he's got heart of gold seeds. This guy claims he's got grateful dog seeds. He
[12:03.820 --> 12:07.180]  also claims he's got tons of seeds from all kinds of other vendors and breeders
[12:07.540 --> 12:10.300]  that it doesn't seem like it's even realistic. I know he doesn't have my
[12:10.300 --> 12:14.780]  stuff. He never bought anything from me. I know most of where my stuff goes. So
[12:14.780 --> 12:20.660]  what I'm saying is that Gray Beard Seeds, the ultimate seed bank at graybeardseeds.com
[12:21.020 --> 12:26.420]  is not an official distributor vendor representative of iRegenetics products
[12:26.420 --> 12:29.460]  in any way, shape or form. They've got a picture of Jerry Garcia up as their
[12:29.460 --> 12:33.860]  picture, as their icon. Jerry's not part of their seed company. Don't fall for
[12:33.860 --> 12:40.460]  this. I can't recommend that you troll them and email them and or contact them
[12:40.460 --> 12:43.420]  and let them know that they suck. I couldn't say to do anything like that
[12:43.820 --> 12:47.380]  because I'm a podcaster and this goes out and I don't want to get myself in
[12:47.380 --> 12:50.940]  any trouble. So make sure that you don't contact them. Make sure that you
[12:50.940 --> 12:53.740]  don't harass them. Make sure that you don't let them know that they're a
[12:53.740 --> 12:58.020]  fraud. Just let them be ignore them and let them continue as usual. All right,
[12:58.020 --> 13:01.260]  my friends that support me and love me, please don't do me any favors by
[13:01.260 --> 13:03.820]  reaching out to these people and disrupting their business for being
[13:03.820 --> 13:07.380]  completely fake. Because if I asked you guys to do something like that, it could
[13:07.380 --> 13:10.580]  backfire and get me in trouble. So please don't do anything like that on my
[13:10.580 --> 13:15.340]  behalf because I clearly did not ask you to do so. Thank you guys. I love you for
[13:15.340 --> 13:19.460]  all of your help and support. All right. Now, my main whole point of pressing
[13:19.460 --> 13:23.340]  pause was to take a dab, but then I saw that Jesse messaged me. So now I'm going
[13:23.340 --> 13:26.220]  to press pause again. Now that I told you guys about what Jesse messaged me and
[13:26.220 --> 13:29.020]  I'm going to go back and message Jesse that he needs to come on the podcast and
[13:29.020 --> 13:32.820]  then I'm actually going to take the dabs that I press pause to take. So once
[13:32.820 --> 13:39.100]  again, please hold. All right, you guys, I am back. I am well medicated. I am
[13:39.100 --> 13:43.100]  hydrated. I was kind of poking around that website a little bit. There's not
[13:43.100 --> 13:46.220]  really a lot of ways to contact them through looking at the app on my phone
[13:46.220 --> 13:51.100]  or at their website on my phone, but maybe you'll, uh, you'll find more. Anyway,
[13:51.100 --> 13:54.460]  I was talking about single pot breeding. For those of you that don't have a lot
[13:54.460 --> 13:58.020]  of space that you're interested in making a few seeds for yourself, why not
[13:58.020 --> 14:01.700]  breed in just one pot? If you're not into the one pot idea, we can also call
[14:01.700 --> 14:05.500]  it one light breeding. And we'll just say every time I say one pot, you just say
[14:05.500 --> 14:10.240]  three or four three gallon pots, however many you can fit under your light. Now
[14:10.240 --> 14:14.120]  let's talk about light for a second. I don't like to breed under anything. I
[14:14.120 --> 14:19.000]  certainly wouldn't go smaller than a 400. You could, but you're not gonna make a
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.800]  lot of seeds. They're not gonna be a lot of viable seeds. They're gonna take
[14:21.800 --> 14:25.640]  longer. If you've got a 600 watt light, that's just about right. A thousand watt,
[14:25.640 --> 14:31.400]  you're golden. A thousand is amazing. Six is good. 400 will be sufficient. Anything
[14:31.400 --> 14:34.200]  less, I think you're gonna make a lot of white seeds. You're not gonna get enough
[14:34.200 --> 14:38.040]  seeds just to make it worth your time and effort. It just won't be any good for
[14:38.040 --> 14:41.960]  you. I would stick with the 400 or bigger. The 600 is probably your best bet if
[14:41.960 --> 14:46.120]  you're just trying to breed for personal seeds. Now I'm talking small spaces, you
[14:46.120 --> 14:49.760]  guys. A lot of people out there are growing in like a 5x5 hydro hut or
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.600]  maybe a small closet or something. That's why I say single light. That's why I got
[14:53.600 --> 14:58.040]  the idea of a single pot. What's to stop you from getting one semi large pot, like
[14:58.040 --> 15:02.840]  maybe a seven gallon, and putting three plants in that seven gallon pot?
[15:02.840 --> 15:06.280]  Three small clones that are, you know, once you put them in the dirt, you've got
[15:06.280 --> 15:10.160]  six, maybe ten inches sticking out, and you veg them up a little bit, and then
[15:10.160 --> 15:14.480]  you get them all about 12 inches tall, maybe 18 inches tall or so, and
[15:14.480 --> 15:17.520]  then you use like a tomato cage or three sticks to spread them out to where
[15:17.520 --> 15:19.960]  they're not all growing straight up the center of the pot. You want to spread
[15:19.960 --> 15:23.720]  them out to where you give a little bit of space in there. Maybe top them, veg
[15:23.720 --> 15:28.060]  them out until they're like 18, 24 inches tall, and then one of those is your male.
[15:28.060 --> 15:32.280]  One of the plants in that three, the trio of plants, there is your boy, and the
[15:32.280 --> 15:35.680]  other two are your females. Maybe you've got an indica and a sativa in there. It
[15:35.680 --> 15:38.240]  may be better if you don't do a full indica and a full sativa because your
[15:38.240 --> 15:41.360]  flowering times will be wonky. You'd want them a little closer together, but it
[15:41.360 --> 15:44.840]  will work. It certainly will work, and you'll make enough seeds for yourself if
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.040]  that's your goal. But put two strains that are similar in there, or two
[15:48.040 --> 15:51.760]  females of the same type, and then one male in there, and flower that out in
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.140]  that one pot. And now you can make enough seeds for yourself with one space, one
[15:56.140 --> 16:00.600]  light, one pot. Now the reason this would be helpful, I've got a couple of great
[16:00.600 --> 16:04.400]  reasons why this would be helpful for you. One reason, maybe if something goes
[16:04.400 --> 16:07.920]  wrong, it looks like you've only got one plant. Instead of having three plants,
[16:07.920 --> 16:11.640]  you're only gonna get in trouble for one should something happen. I don't know how
[16:11.640 --> 16:14.320]  well that'll work for you, but you've only got one pot, so you can only have
[16:14.320 --> 16:17.680]  one plant, right? Alright, another reason why this would be helpful is because now
[16:17.680 --> 16:21.120]  you've only got to water one pot. Yeah, you've got three plants in there, but
[16:21.120 --> 16:24.000]  you've only got to mix up enough nutrients and enough water to water that
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.080]  one pot. And if you're somebody that works a lot, if you're somebody that
[16:27.080 --> 16:31.400]  can't be home constantly, a seven gallon pot is gonna stay wet for like three,
[16:31.400 --> 16:35.480]  maybe four days, depending on your environment and your small grow space. So
[16:35.480 --> 16:39.520]  that'll buy you time. You've only got one pot to water and it reduces numbers and
[16:39.520 --> 16:43.120]  it saves you floor space because you don't have so many pots on the floor.
[16:43.120 --> 16:46.840]  You've only got one pot. And keep in mind that eventually, once you're done
[16:46.840 --> 16:49.860]  pollinating, you're gonna cut down that male plant and it's gonna give you a
[16:49.860 --> 16:54.280]  little bit more space in that pot, so it will be less crowded. So you can probably
[16:54.280 --> 16:57.920]  fit three or four plants in a seven gallon pot. You could flower it all in
[16:57.920 --> 17:02.560]  the same pot, under one 400 watt light, use very little space, and then you can
[17:02.560 --> 17:07.160]  make your own personal seeds. Alright, now let's talk about the same thing, but
[17:07.160 --> 17:11.080]  let's change up the plan of attack and the method just a little bit. Let's say
[17:11.080 --> 17:14.640]  you've got maybe, I like saying a 5x5 hydro hut. Those are very available and
[17:14.640 --> 17:17.600]  it doesn't have to be a hydro hut, just whatever grow hut you can get. Get a
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.200]  quality one or a small 5x5 space. That's kind of what I like for a one light
[17:22.200 --> 17:27.080]  setup. So let's, let's talk like a 5x5 hydro hut with maybe like a 400 watt
[17:27.120 --> 17:31.280]  light in there, maybe a 600 watt light. You've got a duct on top to get the heat
[17:31.280 --> 17:37.280]  and the stale air out. What I would do in a 5x5 hut, I would run a carbon
[17:37.280 --> 17:40.320]  filter. I would hang it from the top. I would run the ducting from the filter
[17:40.320 --> 17:43.840]  through the light. Then I would run, I would have a vented light or a ducted
[17:43.840 --> 17:47.400]  light. Then I would run the ducting up right out of the top and I would set the
[17:47.400 --> 17:52.720]  blower right on top. It's on the outside of the hut, just resting on the roof and
[17:52.720 --> 17:56.680]  it's sucking, it's got ducting attached to it and it's sucking the air through
[17:56.680 --> 17:59.600]  the carbon filter over the light and out of the top of the hut. That way
[17:59.600 --> 18:04.960]  you're extracting air that has been filtered and doesn't stink out of the
[18:04.960 --> 18:08.120]  hut and you will pull fresh air in through the vents in the bottom of the
[18:08.120 --> 18:11.840]  hut while you're pulling that old stale air out and you'll also be cooling the
[18:11.840 --> 18:15.560]  light at the same time. So that one blower is serving multiple purposes. So
[18:15.560 --> 18:21.760]  carbon filter, ducting, light, ducting, blower resting on the top outside and
[18:21.760 --> 18:24.680]  then you're just blowing that heat out. Now all you have to do is get that heat
[18:24.840 --> 18:28.680]  out of whatever room you're in. That heat has to go somewhere. But anyway, so you
[18:28.680 --> 18:33.640]  got a 500 or a 5x5 hut, like a 4 or a 600 watt light in there. If you don't
[18:33.640 --> 18:37.320]  want to do a single pot, here is another method that I have discovered works very
[18:37.320 --> 18:41.780]  well. You could do this for breeding or I like to do this personally for running
[18:41.780 --> 18:45.360]  new seeds. Once I make new seeds, I've got a lot of them and I want to grow them
[18:45.360 --> 18:49.640]  but I don't have a whole bunch of space so I need to grow some small plants. What
[18:49.640 --> 18:54.160]  I'll do in that situation is I will use very small pots. I really like to use
[18:54.200 --> 18:59.840]  4 or 6 inch net pots. If you go to Amazon you can find a 5 or 6 inch net
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.400]  pots used for hydroponics. They're fairly cheap. You can get a pack of 24 for not
[19:04.400 --> 19:08.560]  much money at all. You can probably get free shipping. A pack of 24, if you use
[19:08.560 --> 19:11.560]  the method I'm talking about, you'll have enough for two runs and they are
[19:11.560 --> 19:15.640]  reusable. So it's very affordable. Now what I like to do, I like to get the 6
[19:15.640 --> 19:21.520]  inch net pots and I like to fill them with a very aerated cocoa. Like 50% cocoa,
[19:21.640 --> 19:26.160]  50% perlite. I fill it almost all the way to the top and I'll put my clones
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.760]  right inside there. For my seedling, I will sprout it and get it galled,
[19:29.760 --> 19:33.640]  germinate it and I'll get it growing and then I'll put it into the cocoa. And then
[19:33.640 --> 19:39.040]  I take, I get Tupperware or Rubbermaid dishes from Walmart or Target and
[19:39.040 --> 19:44.240]  they're only like 6 maybe 5 maybe 8 inches tall at the most and they're just
[19:44.240 --> 19:47.480]  made for like storing clothes underneath the bed or something. Some of them have
[19:47.480 --> 19:51.080]  wheels on them but I like to get them, they're about 3 feet long and then
[19:51.120 --> 19:56.080]  they're probably 18 inches wide and I like to put 5 of the 6 inch net pots
[19:56.080 --> 20:01.320]  per Rubbermaid container. So I do a row of 3 and a row of 2 and they fit like 3
[20:01.320 --> 20:03.960]  and then 2. They don't, they don't fit side by side. They're not parallel, they're
[20:03.960 --> 20:08.360]  staggered. I'm sure you know what I mean right? So I got 5 per tub and I do 2
[20:08.360 --> 20:13.920]  tubs under one light. So now I've got 10 of those in the 6 inch net pots and when
[20:13.920 --> 20:17.480]  I put them into the cocoa the first time, I'll water from the top. I will water
[20:17.600 --> 20:21.560]  those plants with a lot of mammoth microbes, Plus Life from Vegbloom, a
[20:21.560 --> 20:26.400]  little bit of Vegbloom base, maybe a little Liquid Karma, maybe Cow Mag if it
[20:26.400 --> 20:30.000]  needs it, and then a little bit of carbohydrates depending on what brand of
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.600]  carbohydrates I'm working with at the time. But I'll add some carbs in there to
[20:33.600 --> 20:37.640]  get it going. But you want to focus on the root development at that time anyway.
[20:37.640 --> 20:41.360]  I will water it from the top at that time. I'll put the clone into the cocoa and
[20:41.360 --> 20:44.840]  water it from the top just like normal. Get the cocoa saturated. It's been
[20:44.840 --> 20:48.520]  transplanted. It's cool. Then I set them into the Rubbermaid dish and slide them
[20:48.520 --> 20:53.160]  under the one light. Now that's the last time those plants get watered from the
[20:53.160 --> 20:58.280]  top. Now I mix up a 3 gallon or a 5 gallon jug of water every Monday and
[20:58.280 --> 21:02.240]  shake the shit out of it and divide it in half and pour 2 and a half gallons of
[21:02.240 --> 21:05.840]  water. I try to save some you guys. If I do the 5 gallon container, I only try to
[21:05.840 --> 21:10.320]  do about 1 and a half to 2 gallons of water per Rubbermaid container and I
[21:10.320 --> 21:14.440]  fill it up and it's honestly, I've got long fingers, it's probably a little more
[21:14.440 --> 21:17.440]  than up to the second knuckle. That's got to be an inch and a half, maybe 2
[21:17.440 --> 21:21.480]  inches deep worth of water just sitting in there and it works because those net
[21:21.480 --> 21:24.520]  pots have so much space up top that they're still getting air and they're
[21:24.520 --> 21:29.240]  not drowning. That water only sits in there that deep for like an hour before
[21:29.240 --> 21:33.480]  all the cocoa absorbs it. It just wicks it right up and then you've got like one
[21:33.480 --> 21:37.480]  knuckle deep worth of water and that sits there for a couple of days. When the
[21:37.480 --> 21:41.280]  plants just absorb all of that, they drink it all up from the roots. As the
[21:41.280 --> 21:44.920]  roots get dry, as the cocoa gets dry, it wicks it right up and keeps it going in
[21:44.920 --> 21:49.640]  there and then I let that go. Honestly, I can water it on Monday or Sunday night
[21:49.640 --> 21:52.560]  and then I can work throughout most of the week and I don't have to add water
[21:52.560 --> 21:56.960]  until maybe Thursday or Friday. Actually, today's Thursday and I put just a little
[21:56.960 --> 22:01.500]  bit of fresh water on top to top it off. I watered it Monday, it got dry up, dried
[22:01.500 --> 22:05.560]  up by Wednesday. Today is Thursday. I just added some fresh water on there so
[22:05.560 --> 22:09.520]  that I'm not adding, I didn't even add nutrients today. I just added fresh water.
[22:09.520 --> 22:14.320]  That'll probably rock until like Saturday or Sunday and then Saturday
[22:14.320 --> 22:17.640]  I'll take the plants out, I'll set them on the floor, then I'll take those type
[22:17.640 --> 22:20.320]  of war dishes and clean them out real good. I'll just hose them out outside in
[22:20.320 --> 22:24.560]  the backyard, then I'll bring them back in and then I'll remix more water and
[22:24.560 --> 22:28.080]  then I'll pour that three gallons and divide the three gallons up by the two
[22:28.080 --> 22:31.720]  tubs and set them in there and let it rock just like that under the light.
[22:31.720 --> 22:36.360]  Sometimes I'll do a small breeding project like that. If I'm making new
[22:36.360 --> 22:40.240]  stuff, that's often how I do it. If I'm running new seeds, that's often how I do
[22:40.240 --> 22:44.160]  it. Then I can do 10 small plants under one light. Sometimes you can do even more
[22:44.160 --> 22:47.160]  if you want to do another Tupperware dish and then you just veg them for a
[22:47.160 --> 22:50.760]  very short time just until they're you know like maybe eight inches tall and
[22:50.760 --> 22:54.360]  then you flower them. You don't veg for very long and then that way you can see
[22:54.360 --> 22:57.680]  what you've got. If you're just running a 400 watt light, that's enough space for
[22:57.680 --> 23:00.960]  that many plants. You can see what you've got, you can see what you made if you're
[23:00.960 --> 23:05.240]  running new seeds or you can make plenty of new stuff. I recommend if you're gonna
[23:05.240 --> 23:10.080]  do it that way, do a male separately. Put the male in a saucer and set him to the
[23:10.080 --> 23:13.120]  side because he's gonna get eliminated once he pollinates anyway. So don't
[23:13.120 --> 23:16.880]  waste your space in that Rubbermaid dish for the male. Just put the male in there
[23:16.880 --> 23:21.200]  and water the saucer so that you could take out the saucer, eliminate him once
[23:21.200 --> 23:24.560]  everybody gets grown real well and once everybody's pollinated. So that's a great
[23:24.560 --> 23:29.840]  way to run a semi large number of plants in a small space. You could also do the
[23:29.840 --> 23:33.320]  same thing with beer cups. If you didn't want to spend the money on the six inch
[23:33.480 --> 23:37.360]  net pots, you can fit more beer cups in the same amount of space and you can use
[23:37.360 --> 23:40.520]  the Tupperware container as your reservoir, as your base like I like to do
[23:40.520 --> 23:45.640]  is my hydro table. But that's if you're running that many plants you have to
[23:45.640 --> 23:49.160]  worry about the rules and the laws. So be careful. You can fit a lot more beer cups
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.240]  under that light and you can get them real close together and grow them up
[23:52.240 --> 23:54.760]  till they're about three or four inches tall and then flower them. You can see
[23:54.760 --> 23:57.640]  what you've created. If you want to pollinate those at that height, you
[23:57.640 --> 24:01.000]  certainly can do that. You can make a bunch of seeds from a really short crop.
[24:01.160 --> 24:05.760]  That's a way to do it. But my idea started with a single pot to stay legal
[24:05.760 --> 24:08.840]  and get away from all the large numbers. But if you want to go with large numbers,
[24:08.840 --> 24:12.200]  just use beer cups. Make sure you poke holes in the bottom so you get plenty of
[24:12.200 --> 24:16.240]  drainage. I like to use a drill and I stack like five or six cups together and
[24:16.240 --> 24:19.240]  go straight through the bottom three or four times and then I actually like to
[24:19.240 --> 24:23.800]  go through the side right about I don't know maybe half an inch up just go right
[24:23.800 --> 24:26.840]  through the side of the cup four times so you have plenty of drainage. If you're
[24:26.840 --> 24:29.920]  gonna be filling the reservoir and you're using the cups you can't go as
[24:29.920 --> 24:33.400]  deep because you will start to get root rot. There's not as much drainage
[24:33.400 --> 24:37.720]  happening, not as much oxygen. You have to be careful. It would be a good idea to
[24:37.720 --> 24:41.560]  put an air stone to get one of those aquarium air stones with the two that
[24:41.560 --> 24:45.480]  come off and drop one air stone in each reservoir of water to keep the oxygen
[24:45.480 --> 24:49.560]  level in there high. But if you're using well aerated cocoa with the net pots you
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.280]  should be fine. If you're using beer cups you certainly need oxygen flowing in
[24:54.280 --> 25:00.800]  that water or it will get funky. Treat it kind of like hydro. Measure your PPMs
[25:00.800 --> 25:05.000]  and stuff. Don't overdo it and then just let it flower. If you're doing brand new
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.400]  seeds I like to let new seeds go nine to ten weeks. If you're pollinating to make
[25:08.400 --> 25:13.240]  new seeds let that go. You'll probably have pollination start happening. If
[25:13.240 --> 25:16.920]  you're not touching anything the pollen will start dropping around day 14. Go in
[25:16.920 --> 25:21.080]  there and smack the plant one time around day 25. You really have heavy
[25:21.080 --> 25:25.600]  pollination by then. Wait until about day 65 to cut that stuff down. Let it dry
[25:25.600 --> 25:29.880]  and you've just made a tester batch of seeds with one light, possibly one pot,
[25:29.880 --> 25:35.560]  possibly a Tupperware dish. This depends on what method you chose. Oh something I
[25:35.560 --> 25:39.160]  should mention it just dawned on me. If you're gonna do the the Tupperware
[25:39.160 --> 25:42.440]  method with the water in there it is cold as shit right now you guys. It's
[25:42.440 --> 25:45.940]  Colorado where I am. It's wintertime. It's getting cold. Even in the house the
[25:45.940 --> 25:50.440]  floor is cold. Get that Tupperware container up off the floor. Just put
[25:50.440 --> 25:53.000]  something underneath it to where it's not touching the floor to where you can get it a
[25:53.000 --> 25:56.040]  little bit warmer. That water in there will get cold. That will cause you
[25:56.040 --> 26:00.720]  problems right now. If you're in Cali and it's not cold don't worry about it. But
[26:00.720 --> 26:03.920]  if you're somewhere like I am right now starting to get super chilly don't let
[26:03.920 --> 26:07.960]  that water get real cold. You guys it may sound like I'm oversimplifying things
[26:07.960 --> 26:10.920]  but if you're trying to do stuff for yourself in your house and you don't
[26:10.920 --> 26:14.640]  have a lot of resources it shouldn't be as intimidating as a lot of people think
[26:14.640 --> 26:19.160]  it is. You can breed just like I said under one light in very very minimal
[26:19.160 --> 26:22.320]  conditions and you can have great success. Don't scare yourself. Don't
[26:22.320 --> 26:26.960]  overcomplicate it. Don't overthink things. Keep it simple stoner. I think a lot of
[26:26.960 --> 26:30.380]  people make mistakes in the grow by overthinking. They cause problems by
[26:30.380 --> 26:34.120]  overthinking. When people come to me for advice on the internet and they're like
[26:34.120 --> 26:37.040]  man this is going wrong I don't know what to do I don't know what to do what
[26:37.040 --> 26:41.120]  should I do? I tell them dude smoke a joint go for a walk and then come back
[26:41.120 --> 26:43.920]  and look at your plants and the answer will come to you. You won't be so
[26:43.920 --> 26:47.120]  freaked out. You won't be so panicky. You won't be overthinking it. You're just
[26:47.120 --> 26:50.920]  driving yourself crazy. It's what we do with most of life honestly I think. Try
[26:50.920 --> 26:54.560]  to overanalyze things. Overthink it. Look too deep into things. You start fucking
[26:54.560 --> 26:58.920]  up. Just see what you see and accept it. Alright don't overthink the grow. It's
[26:58.920 --> 27:03.240]  not that hard you guys. It's nature. These plants grow like I've said it
[27:03.240 --> 27:07.340]  several times. The cush grows on a mountain on a cush mountain. A goat peed
[27:07.340 --> 27:10.800]  on it. It got a bunch of wind. It got a bunch of rocks thrown at it. It was not a
[27:10.800 --> 27:14.400]  happy plant and it survived. That's where it happened. It's where it's all from.
[27:14.520 --> 27:18.760]  Durban poison is from Africa. We have a Durban poison plant that won't grow in
[27:18.760 --> 27:21.920]  the garden. We couldn't figure out what to do with it. We quit giving it water.
[27:21.920 --> 27:27.280]  Guess what it grows. They're from random places with random conditions. They
[27:27.280 --> 27:31.200]  didn't come from place. They none of these plants were they didn't happen
[27:31.200 --> 27:35.520]  naturally in a grow room in a sterile facility. They were on a mountain. They
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.800]  were in a jungle. They were in a forest. They were in shitty climates getting
[27:38.800 --> 27:42.440]  pissed on by goats getting chewed at by bats. Random terrible things were
[27:42.440 --> 27:45.720]  happening to these plants and they survived. So don't be scared to take it
[27:45.720 --> 27:50.320]  and treat it like a plant. It's not a puppy. It's not a dog. It's not an iPad.
[27:50.320 --> 27:54.760]  It can take some bullshit. Also you may kill some plants in your time. I've
[27:54.760 --> 27:58.720]  killed a lot of plants. Don't get me wrong. I've killed a lot of shit. That's
[27:58.720 --> 28:02.480]  how I learned to be a good grower. I only post really cool things to Instagram. I
[28:02.480 --> 28:05.600]  only tell you about really cool experiences on the podcast. You guys
[28:05.600 --> 28:09.520]  guess what? I've gotten spider mites a lot. I've had powdery mildew before. I've
[28:09.640 --> 28:14.040]  had bud rot. I have fucked up trays of clones. One time when I was a new grower
[28:14.040 --> 28:17.400]  I got too stoned and fell asleep and left a grow room door open all night and
[28:17.400 --> 28:20.440]  seeded the entire fucking crop and harmed the whole thing. So guess what you
[28:20.440 --> 28:24.120]  guys? I make mistakes. Don't be afraid to try new stuff. Don't be afraid to make
[28:24.120 --> 28:27.880]  some mistakes and don't be afraid to not treat this plant like it's a princess.
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.360]  It's a weed. They called it weed for a reason. Alright I'd love to hear it if
[28:32.360 --> 28:35.160]  you decide to use any of my new growing techniques I taught you today. If you're
[28:35.160 --> 28:38.640]  gonna breed in a single pot. If you're gonna breed in several small pots. If
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.080]  you're gonna breed in the little tray and six inch net pot or if you're gonna
[28:42.080 --> 28:45.280]  grow in the six inch net pots like I recommended. I'd love to hear what you're
[28:45.280 --> 28:48.600]  gonna do. If you have any questions let me know. You can reach out to me at

[29:36.200 --> 29:39.720]  what you've got to say. I'm supposed to remind you again about the email. I keep

[29:43.000 --> 29:46.440]  you're not into the social media and you'd like to reach out the email is the
[29:46.440 --> 29:51.680]  way to do it. growfromyourheart at hotmail.com. You guys don't forget that I
[29:51.680 --> 29:55.280]  put out Throwback Thursday episodes every Thursday. The reason I do that is
[29:55.280 --> 29:59.240]  because iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes in their feed and I've got
[29:59.240 --> 30:03.240]  256 episodes out now. That means there are episodes people cannot find in the
[30:03.240 --> 30:07.800]  feed. I am putting old episodes together in blocks of like maybe three maybe five
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.120]  episodes. It's usually about three hours worth of content. I mash them all
[30:11.120 --> 30:14.360]  together and then I release them on a Thursday. That way you can go back and
[30:14.360 --> 30:18.480]  listen to that old stuff. The trick now is that a lot of that old stuff is being
[30:18.480 --> 30:23.160]  reposted and it's pushing the older old stuff out. So my solution to that like I
[30:23.160 --> 30:26.680]  mentioned earlier is to put it up on YouTube. You can find the show on YouTube.
[30:26.760 --> 30:31.600]  The first 103 maybe 105 episodes are available on YouTube. Simply search for
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.640]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Click subscribe. Click like. Interact with me
[30:35.640 --> 30:40.340]  there. I would appreciate it. Also one more request. I would love it if you'd go
[30:40.340 --> 30:45.120]  to iTunes and give me a five-star review on iTunes and click subscribe. Also type
[30:45.120 --> 30:49.160]  in a comment. Let me know what you think about the show. I may read your review on
[30:49.160 --> 30:55.600]  a future episode if you leave an iTunes rating and review. Alright you guys my
[30:55.600 --> 30:58.680]  throat is burning out. I want to thank everybody for listening to this episode.
[30:58.680 --> 31:02.640]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Johnny Snipes and until next time
[31:02.640 --> 31:17.760]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[31:36.080 --> 31:53.200]  When I'm traveling my journey, yes I always remember him. Trip, trip, trip, break it in. Yes I always remember him. Trip, trip, trip, break it in. Yes I always remember him.
[31:53.200 --> 32:07.200]  And I can remember the first time I feel. Jump, jump, across the border. I was so young and green.
[32:07.200 --> 32:23.200]  But Georgia know that we were real. I was so young and green. But Georgia know that we were real.
[32:23.200 --> 32:43.200]  Georgia, Georgia, oh Georgia, oh. Georgia, Georgia, oh Georgia, oh. And I can remember going to the city. The Apple, yes the big Apple.
[32:43.200 --> 33:05.200]  And I can remember going to the city. The Apple, yes the big Apple. Is everything gonna be like before? Is everything gonna be like before? The whole of we feel it, yes, we feel it, yes, we feel it.
