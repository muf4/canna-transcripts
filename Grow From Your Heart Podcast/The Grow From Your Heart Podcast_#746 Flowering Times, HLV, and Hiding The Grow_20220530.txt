[00:14.650 --> 00:26.480]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:26.480 --> 00:27.480]  I'm your host.
[00:27.480 --> 00:29.360]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:29.360 --> 00:34.440]  This is episode 746 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:34.440 --> 00:36.480]  I've got a great show lined up for you.
[00:36.480 --> 00:40.360]  Before we get to the main topic, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind folks
[00:40.360 --> 00:43.920]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[00:54.520 --> 00:57.020]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to Gramps Memel.
[00:57.020 --> 01:00.320]  Let's send a big fist bump to a longtime supporter, my buddy Single T.
[01:00.320 --> 01:02.440]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Rutrow.
[01:02.440 --> 01:05.800]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to a good friend, Lefty's Farm.
[01:05.800 --> 01:08.400]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Pac Northwest Dan.
[01:08.400 --> 01:12.000]  Let's send a big thank you to Ivan M. Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From
[01:12.000 --> 01:16.440]  Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to Spartan420.
[01:16.440 --> 01:21.320]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:21.320 --> 01:24.920]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:24.920 --> 01:31.240]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:31.240 --> 01:34.960]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen and you know I do include
[01:34.960 --> 01:39.360]  a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.160]  of my friends to support the podcast.
[01:43.160 --> 01:46.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do want to let you know that I was just on the Dude Grows show.
[01:46.520 --> 01:50.400]  I recorded what I think was a great episode with the Dude Grows crew.
[01:50.400 --> 01:55.760]  Scotty Real is on a vacation so I got to co-host the show and fill in for Scotty Real.
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.860]  Maybe I've said too much already but make sure to look forward and stay tuned for the
[01:59.860 --> 02:04.040]  episode of the Dude Grows show featuring myself as a co-host.
[02:04.040 --> 02:06.640]  Big thanks to my friends at the Dude Grows show for having me.
[02:06.640 --> 02:07.640]  It's a great show.
[02:07.920 --> 02:09.520]  I try to find my balance there.
[02:09.520 --> 02:12.720]  I feel like I should talk more but also I feel like I'm interrupting a lot.
[02:12.720 --> 02:14.720]  I talk a lot enough here.
[02:14.720 --> 02:18.920]  It's a whole new dynamic learning to have a co-host so I hope you watch that.
[02:18.920 --> 02:19.920]  Hope you enjoy the show.
[02:19.920 --> 02:22.920]  We covered some great topics, showed some great photos.
[02:22.920 --> 02:25.000]  Shout out to my buddy ADHD Grower.
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.160]  Anyway, check out the Dude Grows show.
[02:28.160 --> 02:32.440]  If I'm going to talk about the Dude Grows show, you know I've got to talk about the
[02:32.440 --> 02:34.400]  Dude Grows cup.
[02:34.680 --> 02:39.920]  Coming up at the end of July, July 30th in Fort Collins, Colorado, I will be attending
[02:39.920 --> 02:42.960]  and vending at the Dude Grows cup.
[02:42.960 --> 02:43.960]  Come hang out.
[02:43.960 --> 02:48.600]  Come smoke some dabs, smoke some flowers, grab some beans, shake my hand, get a selfie,
[02:48.600 --> 02:49.600]  get a fist bump.
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.480]  It'll be a great time to see you, meet you, reconnect with you at the Dude Grows cup.
[02:54.480 --> 02:56.040]  More info is on the Dude Grows website.
[02:56.040 --> 02:58.100]  I'm sure that's dudegrows.com.
[02:58.100 --> 03:02.680]  Check that out for all the links, dates, deets, and info right there.
[03:02.680 --> 03:05.560]  Excuse me for clearing the throat.
[03:05.560 --> 03:08.440]  I did just take a fat dab right before I pressed record here.
[03:08.440 --> 03:10.200]  Took a fat dab of a concentrate.
[03:10.200 --> 03:13.000]  When I bought it, I was confused.
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.680]  It looks like it says ROYGBIVRED and then luckily I've got a lot of friends with a lot
[03:17.680 --> 03:18.680]  of cool jobs.
[03:18.680 --> 03:21.240]  Somebody told me that this ROYGBIV, I'm going to show that to the camera.
[03:21.240 --> 03:26.960]  I don't know if it'll pick it up from that far away, but it is the letters R-O-Y-G-B-I-V
[03:26.960 --> 03:27.960]  and then the word red.
[03:27.960 --> 03:30.120]  I've read it as ROYGBIVRED.
[03:30.120 --> 03:33.960]  One of our good friends told me that that is actually, it stands for red, orange, yellow,
[03:33.960 --> 03:38.760]  green, blue, indigo, and violet and red, which makes a lot of sense because this is a blend
[03:38.760 --> 03:44.240]  of headbanger and rainbow belts and on the package the flavor is of course described
[03:44.240 --> 03:45.760]  as gassy rainbows.
[03:45.760 --> 03:48.200]  I just took a big old fat dab of this.
[03:48.200 --> 03:49.320]  It's got me a little bit choked up.
[03:49.320 --> 03:50.320]  It's got me coughing.
[03:50.320 --> 03:53.060]  I do apologize for the funky throat here at the start of the show.
[03:53.060 --> 03:54.060]  That will go away.
[03:54.060 --> 03:56.640]  That's what you get when you listen to a dab and a grow podcast.
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.080]  Anyway, I wanted to let you know what I'm smoking and let you know why.
[03:59.080 --> 04:01.520]  I sound like I'm clogged up here at the start.
[04:01.520 --> 04:03.200]  We'll get through that.
[04:03.200 --> 04:05.920]  Talking about the Dude Grows show and the Dude Grows cup.
[04:05.920 --> 04:10.200]  While I was on the Dude Grows show, I did drop some hints, some information, some details
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.840]  that you guys may not know that I think I should share here with my audience since I
[04:13.840 --> 04:15.760]  said it on the Dude Grows show.
[04:15.760 --> 04:21.320]  I recently told you that I put the plants out in the greenhouse to do a breeding project
[04:21.320 --> 04:22.760]  in the greenhouse.
[04:22.760 --> 04:28.200]  I have not revealed what plants are out there, but I did say on the Dude Grows show that
[04:28.320 --> 04:31.240]  I put a Jack the Ripper male outside.
[04:31.240 --> 04:34.600]  The outdoor pollen donor will be the Jack the Ripper plant.
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.360]  There are two clones of the Jack the Ripper.
[04:36.360 --> 04:37.640]  They're in different places in the grow.
[04:37.640 --> 04:38.640]  Of course, different places.
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.640]  They can't be both in the same spot.
[04:39.640 --> 04:43.200]  There are two strategically placed Jack the Ripper males.
[04:43.200 --> 04:47.960]  The same cut, the same male, just two plants, two clones of the same plant in different
[04:47.960 --> 04:48.960]  locations.
[04:48.960 --> 04:50.600]  That way we can maximize pollen.
[04:50.600 --> 04:52.100]  We know how the air moves in there.
[04:52.100 --> 04:53.800]  We know what plants are going to get the most pollen.
[04:53.800 --> 04:55.520]  We got it set up how we want it.
[04:55.680 --> 04:59.240]  The male plants that are in there are the Jack the Ripper.
[04:59.240 --> 05:02.480]  All of the crosses that come from there will be the Jack the Ripper crosses.
[05:02.480 --> 05:05.120]  They will, of course, all be regular crosses.
[05:05.120 --> 05:07.360]  These are not going to be feminized seeds.
[05:07.360 --> 05:09.160]  They will be rags.
[05:09.160 --> 05:13.160]  Some of the Jack the Ripper crosses that you have seen may be being remade, restocked with
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.160]  the outdoor.
[05:14.160 --> 05:16.400]  Also, there may be some brand new stuff coming.
[05:16.400 --> 05:17.880]  Keep listening to future episodes.
[05:17.880 --> 05:19.320]  Stay tuned to the social media.
[05:19.320 --> 05:21.160]  I like to leak info like that slowly.
[05:21.160 --> 05:22.480]  I don't want to tell you the whole project.
[05:22.480 --> 05:23.480]  We just put them out there.
[05:23.800 --> 05:27.160]  Can't give you all the details and info already.
[05:27.160 --> 05:28.160]  Where do we go from there?
[05:28.160 --> 05:29.160]  All right.
[05:29.160 --> 05:31.040]  I was also on Caribou Heart TV.
[05:31.040 --> 05:33.000]  There's a great podcast on YouTube.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.240]  It's more of a hang, not as much of a podcast, I guess, but it is on.
[05:36.240 --> 05:37.400]  It's a great hangout to watch.
[05:37.400 --> 05:39.200]  It is on the YouTube channel.
[05:39.200 --> 05:45.920]  If you go to Caribou Heart TV, C-A-R-I-B-O-O, Heart TV, Caribou Heart TV, that is how they
[05:45.920 --> 05:46.920]  spell it.
[05:46.920 --> 05:49.320]  I did hang out on their show.
[05:49.320 --> 05:50.320]  We had a great time.
[05:50.320 --> 05:52.440]  Shout out to all of my friends at Caribou Heart TV.
[05:52.440 --> 05:55.360]  There are nine people over there, so I'm not going to start giving out shout outs.
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.800]  I don't have the whole list here, but shout out to everybody.
[05:57.800 --> 06:03.440]  A great collection of personalities, ladies and gentlemen from across the nation, great
[06:03.440 --> 06:05.960]  accents and great people all over the place, good vibes.
[06:05.960 --> 06:06.960]  The whole crew is great.
[06:06.960 --> 06:08.480]  But I was on their show.
[06:08.480 --> 06:12.640]  In their show, we did fall into a conversation about flowering times.
[06:12.640 --> 06:17.720]  I do believe that in that episode, I said that flowering times are often like a speed
[06:17.720 --> 06:18.720]  limit.
[06:18.720 --> 06:19.720]  I do make seeds.
[06:19.720 --> 06:20.720]  Maybe you're not fully aware.
[06:20.720 --> 06:25.320]  I am the sole breeder, sole proprietor for Irie Genetics Premium Seeds.
[06:25.320 --> 06:30.280]  Maybe I can't say sole anymore because we do have the greenhouse, but I'm the lead breeder,
[06:30.280 --> 06:32.600]  I guess, for Irie Genetics Premium Seeds.
[06:32.600 --> 06:34.280]  Everything is done under my supervision.
[06:34.280 --> 06:36.760]  But what I'm leaning at is I make the seeds.
[06:36.760 --> 06:37.760]  I make the packaging.
[06:37.760 --> 06:39.280]  I put the labels on the packaging.
[06:39.280 --> 06:44.040]  When it comes time to determining how long a plant should be flowered, I am the one that
[06:44.040 --> 06:46.480]  writes the flowering time on the package of seeds.
[06:46.480 --> 06:51.280]  When you get a pack of seeds, it's very common that it will say, strawberry starburst, nine
[06:51.280 --> 06:52.720]  to 10 weeks flowering time.
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.240]  That's something that it would typically say on a seed package.
[06:55.240 --> 06:57.920]  Some of them don't say that, but it is listed on the website.
[06:57.920 --> 07:00.720]  And if it doesn't say that, I just have to update the packaging.
[07:00.720 --> 07:03.960]  Anyway, I am the one that puts that flowering time on there.
[07:03.960 --> 07:05.640]  How do I determine that flowering time?
[07:05.640 --> 07:10.120]  I've determined that by sending out a lot of testers of those seeds, by growing a lot
[07:10.120 --> 07:13.560]  of those seeds myself, and taking them to a full flower.
[07:13.560 --> 07:17.080]  I have a pretty good idea of how long they're going to take to flower because I have grown
[07:17.080 --> 07:19.600]  them enough to have experience with them.
[07:19.600 --> 07:22.240]  History notes, basically experience.
[07:22.240 --> 07:24.080]  So I write down, this time it took eight weeks.
[07:24.080 --> 07:25.420]  This phenotype took eight weeks.
[07:25.420 --> 07:27.200]  This phenotype took nine weeks.
[07:27.200 --> 07:28.200]  Now I put an average together.
[07:28.200 --> 07:31.720]  I put that on the back of the package.
[07:31.720 --> 07:35.200]  It is my suggestion that you flower those plants for that long.
[07:35.200 --> 07:36.800]  That's why I put that on there.
[07:36.800 --> 07:42.080]  Now keep in mind, there will be most of the phenotypes, probably 70 to 80% of the phenotypes
[07:42.080 --> 07:46.280]  that you find in those seed packs will fall within the timeframe that I recommended.
[07:46.280 --> 07:50.280]  If I said eight to nine weeks or nine to 10 weeks, most of your phenotypes are going to
[07:50.280 --> 07:51.460]  fall within that window.
[07:51.460 --> 07:53.220]  There will be outliers.
[07:53.220 --> 07:57.280]  There will be some that most likely, I am not even going to try to say that some will
[07:57.280 --> 07:58.280]  finish earlier.
[07:58.280 --> 07:59.280]  That's very uncommon.
[07:59.280 --> 08:01.840]  People that say their plants finish super early, I don't like that.
[08:01.840 --> 08:03.120]  I like later finishing plants.
[08:03.120 --> 08:06.780]  I'm not going to try to hype you up and make you think they finish earlier than they do.
[08:06.780 --> 08:09.080]  They're going to take nine, maybe 10 weeks.
[08:09.080 --> 08:12.320]  There may be some phenotypes in there that do go a little bit longer than the nine to
[08:12.320 --> 08:16.600]  10 weeks that I recommended on the package, but it will be unlikely that you'll get earlier
[08:16.600 --> 08:17.600]  finishers.
[08:17.600 --> 08:19.600]  But the 10 to 20%, they may go longer.
[08:19.600 --> 08:20.600]  You may get 11.
[08:20.600 --> 08:22.180]  You may get a 12-week finisher.
[08:22.180 --> 08:24.000]  That is just how genetics work.
[08:24.000 --> 08:26.480]  Sometimes there are outliers that pop up in population.
[08:26.480 --> 08:28.240]  That is just how it goes.
[08:28.240 --> 08:32.480]  So it's my recommendation that you go the time that I wrote on the package.
[08:32.480 --> 08:38.320]  When I say go nine weeks, I don't mean go the end of eight weeks and the start of the
[08:38.320 --> 08:39.320]  ninth week.
[08:39.320 --> 08:40.520]  I mean finish the ninth week.
[08:40.520 --> 08:46.120]  If I say nine to 10 weeks, I'm recommending to finish that 10th week, 70 full days.
[08:46.120 --> 08:50.080]  And I definitely recommend going longer on your first run with the plant.
[08:50.080 --> 08:53.240]  This is the first time you're growing it, not the last time.
[08:53.240 --> 08:56.560]  We need to build a relationship with this plant and see what its potential is and what
[08:56.560 --> 08:59.080]  it does and what it likes and what it doesn't like.
[08:59.080 --> 09:06.960]  So the first run, why not go 70 days or why not take a few clones and run 160, 163, 165,
[09:06.960 --> 09:11.440]  167, and 170, and then 172 and 75?
[09:11.440 --> 09:13.560]  I know I'm being—that's a dream life, right?
[09:13.560 --> 09:14.560]  That's everybody's dream.
[09:14.560 --> 09:17.560]  But why—do what you can to see how long that plant can go.
[09:17.560 --> 09:19.760]  Take it the full term and see what it does.
[09:19.760 --> 09:21.400]  It may get really good at the end.
[09:21.400 --> 09:24.720]  Some plants beef up, bulk up, put on different flavors right at the end.
[09:24.720 --> 09:26.680]  They get super potent right at the end.
[09:26.680 --> 09:28.560]  So give it the opportunity to finish.
[09:28.560 --> 09:34.320]  When I write nine to 10 weeks, I mean nine full weeks, maybe 10 weeks, possibly 11 is
[09:34.320 --> 09:36.000]  what I really mean on there.
[09:36.040 --> 09:37.840]  Think about it as a speed limit.
[09:37.840 --> 09:42.240]  The speed limit, it's cool if you go the speed limit, but you could go a little slower.
[09:42.240 --> 09:44.680]  You could definitely go a little bit faster.
[09:44.680 --> 09:45.680]  There are exceptions.
[09:45.680 --> 09:47.400]  There are variables.
[09:47.400 --> 09:48.400]  You could do it.
[09:48.400 --> 09:49.760]  You could adjust to traffic.
[09:49.760 --> 09:52.620]  Also, you have to adjust for phenotypes.
[09:52.620 --> 09:56.840]  If I took the same plant—so if I found a plant that finished, I dialed it in to where
[09:56.840 --> 09:59.560]  I know that every time, 74 days, it's done.
[09:59.560 --> 10:04.080]  If I put it in your grow, it could take 69 or it could take 79 days.
[10:04.160 --> 10:08.640]  It could take five days either direction to take a little bit longer or earlier to finish
[10:08.640 --> 10:10.120]  because of the environment.
[10:10.120 --> 10:14.040]  Because maybe you're growing—I'm in, let's say hypothetically, I'm in cocoa.
[10:14.040 --> 10:15.880]  Maybe you're in living soil.
[10:15.880 --> 10:17.280]  Maybe I'm running HPS.
[10:17.280 --> 10:18.840]  Maybe you're running LED.
[10:18.840 --> 10:20.420]  Maybe it's really humid in my room.
[10:20.420 --> 10:22.760]  Maybe it's really dry and really hot in your room.
[10:22.760 --> 10:27.000]  I don't know the differences, but there could be—all of the variables in our rooms create
[10:27.000 --> 10:28.640]  more variables within the plant.
[10:28.640 --> 10:31.440]  So that is also going to contribute to the flowering time.
[10:31.440 --> 10:34.240]  It may take 74 in my room, 74.
[10:34.240 --> 10:37.200]  It may be overdone, dry, dead, and crispy in your room.
[10:37.200 --> 10:38.200]  Maybe it's lights.
[10:38.200 --> 10:39.200]  Maybe it's air.
[10:39.200 --> 10:40.200]  Maybe it's water.
[10:40.200 --> 10:41.200]  Maybe it's soil.
[10:41.200 --> 10:42.200]  Maybe you sprayed yours.
[10:42.200 --> 10:43.200]  Maybe we're playing different music.
[10:43.200 --> 10:44.700]  Maybe you touched yours in a different way.
[10:44.700 --> 10:49.280]  It could be any kind of different thing that is making our plants have—every variable
[10:49.280 --> 10:52.120]  is a variable that you will see in the end.
[10:52.120 --> 10:54.920]  So you'll have to adjust for phenotypes.
[10:54.920 --> 10:57.440]  Some things may take longer in different rooms.
[10:57.440 --> 10:59.720]  Keep in mind, I said it is like the speed limit.
[10:59.720 --> 11:01.600]  You don't have to go the full speed limit.
[11:01.600 --> 11:03.960]  You can go a little bit faster if you would like.
[11:03.960 --> 11:10.400]  So when I put the 9 to 10 weeks on there, I fully recommend you go at least 9 full weeks.
[11:10.400 --> 11:12.880]  Maybe go all the way up to 10, maybe 11 weeks.
[11:12.880 --> 11:13.880]  All right.
[11:13.880 --> 11:17.040]  Let's jump into the next part of the podcast because I do have another great topic that
[11:17.040 --> 11:18.400]  we should talk about.
[11:18.400 --> 11:22.480]  Before I start talking about it, I want to say that I am—I'm not a scientist.
[11:22.480 --> 11:24.040]  I don't understand viruses.
[11:24.040 --> 11:28.640]  I don't understand all of the scientific doctor talk that comes along with that.
[11:28.640 --> 11:30.960]  I am not a biology major.
[11:30.960 --> 11:32.160]  I am a cannabis grower.
[11:32.160 --> 11:36.320]  I learned most of what I know about cannabis growing by growing cannabis.
[11:36.320 --> 11:37.720]  A lot of people go to school for it.
[11:37.720 --> 11:42.360]  I've got mad respect for you, for the people that paid for an education that went to school.
[11:42.360 --> 11:43.360]  That is not how I learn.
[11:43.360 --> 11:44.680]  I'm a hands-on learner.
[11:44.680 --> 11:50.400]  So there are some areas where I am not qualified to teach in a scientific manner.
[11:50.400 --> 11:54.600]  I'm going to teach you about the hoplate and viroid in the way that I understand, and we'll
[11:54.600 --> 11:59.840]  talk about the important parts that us as growers need to do, understand, and know about.
[11:59.840 --> 12:04.680]  So where I'm not even going to try to identify or explain what this virus is.
[12:04.680 --> 12:07.480]  There is a virus that is going around the cannabis community.
[12:07.480 --> 12:09.780]  Our plants are getting infected and getting sick.
[12:09.780 --> 12:15.280]  It is known as the hoplatent viroid or HLV is what I see it listed as all the time.
[12:15.280 --> 12:16.280]  It is decimating crops.
[12:16.280 --> 12:17.840]  It is killing plants.
[12:17.840 --> 12:22.240]  Once it gets in the plant, I don't know of a way to get rid of it other than tissue culture.
[12:22.240 --> 12:26.840]  That is the only way you can, and that's expensive and also not available to everybody.
[12:26.840 --> 12:32.080]  So hoplatent viroid, how do we prevent this virus from getting into our plants?
[12:32.080 --> 12:36.440]  A lot of times this virus is transferred when we are cutting clones or doing work in the
[12:36.440 --> 12:38.840]  garden like lollipopping and bottoming.
[12:38.840 --> 12:43.600]  If you are working with more than one, I'd like to say change gloves and clean your scissors
[12:43.600 --> 12:44.980]  between every plant.
[12:44.980 --> 12:49.080]  But I understand sometimes in a commercial application that is not viable.
[12:49.080 --> 12:53.520]  So maybe change gloves and change clean your scissors between every row or at least if
[12:53.520 --> 12:57.440]  you're working with like a row of blueberry and then a row of strawberry, change your
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.760]  gloves and scissors between those rows.
[12:59.760 --> 13:02.240]  So that way maybe you only infect one row.
[13:02.240 --> 13:04.760]  Try to keep the virus contained if you do have it.
[13:04.760 --> 13:09.840]  So what we've got to think about is be careful not to transfer this virus from one plant
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.600]  to the other, from one row to the other, from one bed to the other, from one section to
[13:14.600 --> 13:15.600]  the other.
[13:15.600 --> 13:17.840]  Try to minimize the risk of moving a virus around.
[13:17.840 --> 13:21.920]  The things that we can do is we can clean our scissors.
[13:21.920 --> 13:23.840]  I've talked before about this on the podcast.
[13:23.840 --> 13:24.940]  I was corrected.
[13:24.940 --> 13:27.240]  We can use bleach to clean the scissors.
[13:27.240 --> 13:29.160]  Rubbing alcohol will not work.
[13:29.160 --> 13:30.160]  Clean all of your tools.
[13:30.160 --> 13:33.480]  I don't know if you're using a scalpel or razor blade, scissors.
[13:33.480 --> 13:37.200]  Maybe just get a bottle of bleach water and spray everything down occasionally.
[13:37.200 --> 13:39.160]  Definitely soak your scissors in some bleach.
[13:39.160 --> 13:41.280]  Sterilize, clean everything, get it super clean.
[13:41.280 --> 13:42.560]  Now is the time.
[13:42.560 --> 13:46.000]  Remember when there was a pandemic and we all went crazy and we started—not everybody,
[13:46.000 --> 13:48.400]  but a lot of people went crazy wearing masks and gloves.
[13:48.400 --> 13:51.760]  Now there's a pandemic in the grow industry, in the grow environment.
[13:51.760 --> 13:53.820]  For a while there, it was the russet mites.
[13:53.820 --> 13:56.120]  Now it seems to be the hoplite and viroid.
[13:56.120 --> 13:58.560]  So now we've got to prepare and protect ourselves from that.
[13:58.560 --> 14:02.160]  So let's clean all of our equipment very thoroughly, very cleanly.
[14:02.160 --> 14:03.600]  Cleanly, is that the word?
[14:03.600 --> 14:04.840]  Whatever, I'm sticking with it.
[14:04.840 --> 14:06.480]  Clean your shit up real good.
[14:06.480 --> 14:08.620]  Also change your gloves.
[14:08.620 --> 14:09.840]  Gloves are hard to get sometimes.
[14:09.840 --> 14:12.800]  I've ordered a lot of gloves and they seem to be coming in and they're trickling in.
[14:12.880 --> 14:16.280]  All the boxes I ordered are coming in in small batches, not all at one time.
[14:16.280 --> 14:21.320]  So change your gloves as often as you economically can and as you seem reasonable.
[14:21.320 --> 14:24.840]  If you work at a commercial grow and you're changing too much, somebody may say something.
[14:24.840 --> 14:29.360]  If you're a home grower, try to keep those gloves fresh, especially from like row to
[14:29.360 --> 14:31.360]  row, definitely from room to room.
[14:31.360 --> 14:33.120]  So just keep yourself clean.
[14:33.120 --> 14:37.480]  Anytime you're cutting the plant, tearing the plant, removing a leaf, make sure that
[14:37.480 --> 14:39.920]  you are protecting yourself in some sort of way.
[14:39.920 --> 14:44.160]  The next thing I want to talk about is, where are you getting your clones from?
[14:44.160 --> 14:45.160]  Who are they coming from?
[14:45.160 --> 14:46.520]  Are they coming from a friend?
[14:46.520 --> 14:47.520]  Are they coming from the mail?
[14:47.520 --> 14:50.660]  There are a lot of services now that offer clones through the mail.
[14:50.660 --> 14:54.840]  If you do get a clone that comes from that service, and I'm not accusing or blaming,
[14:54.840 --> 14:57.280]  I'm just saying possibility, this is what could happen.
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.040]  If you get that clone that comes from a company that you don't know or they don't have any,
[15:02.040 --> 15:03.040]  you don't know them.
[15:03.040 --> 15:05.680]  What are you going to do if they send you a clone with a virus?
[15:05.680 --> 15:10.160]  You're not going to find out for 30, 60, maybe 90 days that you've even got a virus.
[15:10.160 --> 15:12.480]  By then you've spread it to your entire grow.
[15:12.480 --> 15:16.080]  Now your whole grow's got a virus and you paid money for that clone, probably good money
[15:16.080 --> 15:17.240]  for that clone.
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.560]  So where are you getting your clones?
[15:18.560 --> 15:22.440]  I currently am not accepting clones from other friends or other people.
[15:22.440 --> 15:24.720]  If you're like, hey, bro, I want to send you a cut.
[15:24.720 --> 15:26.440]  And I'm like, not right now.
[15:26.440 --> 15:27.440]  It's nothing personal.
[15:27.440 --> 15:28.440]  It's just personal.
[15:28.440 --> 15:30.440]  I don't want to get the virus.
[15:30.440 --> 15:31.800]  We've got to be careful right now.
[15:31.800 --> 15:33.920]  This stuff, my plants are precious to me.
[15:33.920 --> 15:34.920]  I own a seed company.
[15:35.160 --> 15:36.520]  I own a breeding company.
[15:36.520 --> 15:40.480]  I've got to have, imagine if you wiped out my Arise male.
[15:40.480 --> 15:43.380]  Imagine if you wiped out my Strawberry female.
[15:43.380 --> 15:46.120]  Imagine if you took out my Grateful Dog keeper.
[15:46.120 --> 15:47.120]  I don't have that again.
[15:47.120 --> 15:48.120]  It'd be gone.
[15:48.120 --> 15:49.960]  So if I got a virus, it could ruin everything.
[15:49.960 --> 15:51.680]  So I've got to keep everything clean.
[15:51.680 --> 15:53.880]  I recommend you take the same precautions.
[15:53.880 --> 15:56.480]  Love your garden, love your plants as much as I do.
[15:56.480 --> 15:57.480]  Protect that stuff.
[15:57.480 --> 16:03.240]  Now, that being said, do you have backups of your favorite plants?
[16:03.280 --> 16:05.400]  Some of my plants are my livelihood.
[16:05.400 --> 16:07.640]  Also some of my plants are my pride and joy.
[16:07.640 --> 16:08.880]  I've made a lot of great stuff.
[16:08.880 --> 16:13.200]  I've got, so since I'm limited on plant count, here's where I'll branch off.
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.960]  Since I'm limited on plant count, I've, ooh, it took a long time, but I've loosened up
[16:16.960 --> 16:22.160]  and I've given clones of some of my prized possessions to friends of mine to hold on
[16:22.160 --> 16:23.160]  for me.
[16:23.160 --> 16:26.720]  And I really hope and ask them not to spread those clones out, but I'm sure they're going
[16:26.720 --> 16:27.720]  to end up somewhere.
[16:27.720 --> 16:30.960]  But I tell my friends like, hey, I know that you've got a good grow.
[16:30.960 --> 16:32.420]  I don't want to lose this.
[16:32.420 --> 16:33.940]  So I give them a backup.
[16:33.940 --> 16:35.620]  The lemon skunk is somewhere in a grow.
[16:35.620 --> 16:36.900]  The golden goat's somewhere in a grow.
[16:36.900 --> 16:38.600]  The golden goat's all over the place.
[16:38.600 --> 16:43.140]  But the original clone that I've got, it's been shared with friends, so they've got it.
[16:43.140 --> 16:47.480]  A lot of things are a lot of places so that if things do go wrong, if I do get a virus
[16:47.480 --> 16:51.460]  and things have to get wiped out and cleaned up, hopefully I can email a few people, make
[16:51.460 --> 16:56.220]  a few text messages and calls and get a lot of my original lineup back.
[16:56.220 --> 16:58.740]  Hopefully if they don't get the virus as well.
[16:58.740 --> 17:03.020]  Hopefully if I sent them the plants before I did get the virus, which I don't have, so
[17:03.020 --> 17:04.020]  that's fine.
[17:04.020 --> 17:05.340]  They've got the plants, but that's how it would have to go.
[17:05.340 --> 17:07.340]  So do you have a backup plan?
[17:07.340 --> 17:11.660]  Have you sent your clone somewhere or have you made S1s of all of your favorite plants
[17:11.660 --> 17:13.300]  so that you've got keepers?
[17:13.300 --> 17:16.860]  Do you have an idea and a strategy because this could wipe out your grow?
[17:16.860 --> 17:20.420]  There are a lot of things that could decimate your grow, but right now the focus is the
[17:20.420 --> 17:21.420]  virus.
[17:21.420 --> 17:22.420]  But do you have a plan?
[17:22.420 --> 17:24.220]  Do you have a backup for your clones, your seeds?
[17:24.220 --> 17:25.220]  What's going on?
[17:25.220 --> 17:26.220]  There could be a flood.
[17:26.220 --> 17:27.220]  There could be a power outage.
[17:27.220 --> 17:28.900]  One of my biggest fears is fire.
[17:28.900 --> 17:31.420]  All kinds of shit like that could wipe out your preserve.
[17:31.420 --> 17:33.540]  So do you have a backup somewhere?
[17:33.540 --> 17:34.740]  That's what I would start thinking about.
[17:34.740 --> 17:37.780]  All right, that is my quick ramble on the HLV.
[17:37.780 --> 17:43.180]  I told you I wasn't a Scientologist, a biologist, but I do know enough to help protect us as
[17:43.180 --> 17:44.180]  a grower.
[17:44.180 --> 17:48.420]  I know what we should do as growers and farmers to make sure we don't get this into our gardens.
[17:48.420 --> 17:51.020]  I do have one quick email that I will cover.
[17:51.020 --> 17:52.740]  Then we're going to wrap up this show.
[17:52.740 --> 17:57.180]  This email came from our friend who calls themselves Aussie Dank Grower.
[17:57.180 --> 17:58.180]  What's up, mate?
[17:58.180 --> 17:59.180]  Good to meet you.
[17:59.180 --> 18:00.780]  It goes a little bit like this.
[18:00.780 --> 18:02.540]  It says, what's up, Rasta Jeff?
[18:02.540 --> 18:05.140]  I hope you and your loved ones are doing well.
[18:05.140 --> 18:06.420]  Everybody is great, bro.
[18:06.420 --> 18:07.580]  Thank you for the love.
[18:07.580 --> 18:10.220]  It says two part question, and I do like that.
[18:10.220 --> 18:13.340]  It says I'm here in Prohibition Land in Australia.
[18:13.340 --> 18:17.420]  The house I live in, I am renting, and I have a house inspection coming up.
[18:17.420 --> 18:23.500]  I have a five by 10 flower room currently in week three and a five by five in veg.
[18:23.500 --> 18:26.380]  What would be the best way to hide all of these plants?
[18:26.580 --> 18:31.100]  That's a really good, entertaining question.
[18:31.100 --> 18:33.700]  My first answer would be I would have planned around this.
[18:33.700 --> 18:38.140]  I would have done a little bit of a strategy around the inspections, but who knows when
[18:38.140 --> 18:41.020]  the inspections are coming and it's too late to prepare for that now.
[18:41.020 --> 18:44.540]  You guys, if you're thinking about growing, setting up a grow, this is the kind of thing
[18:44.540 --> 18:46.140]  that you need to worry about.
[18:46.140 --> 18:47.700]  Will there be an inspection?
[18:47.700 --> 18:50.380]  Will there be a housing inspection, a landlord inspection?
[18:50.380 --> 18:51.620]  Who's coming in there?
[18:51.620 --> 18:53.380]  Is there somebody coming to visit?
[18:53.380 --> 18:56.420]  Each grow is going to take about 120 days for completion.
[18:56.420 --> 19:01.340]  Do you have that much time without somebody coming into the home, the office, the warehouse,
[19:01.340 --> 19:04.180]  the garage, the shed, wherever you're doing it?
[19:04.180 --> 19:05.900]  Do you have that much security?
[19:05.900 --> 19:07.140]  It's too late to think about that now.
[19:07.140 --> 19:08.140]  The plants are already here.
[19:08.140 --> 19:09.380]  They're already growing.
[19:09.380 --> 19:12.140]  You're going to have to get those plants out of there, my dude.
[19:12.140 --> 19:14.340]  It says what would be the best way to hide it?
[19:14.340 --> 19:18.740]  Do I hire a van or a truck or do I hide them all in a crawl space in the roof?
[19:18.740 --> 19:21.180]  Or do you have any other sneaky ideas?
[19:21.180 --> 19:25.580]  And it says, because I'm a renter, I'm unable ... This is the second part of the question.
[19:25.580 --> 19:26.580]  Sneaky ideas.
[19:26.580 --> 19:30.900]  I think putting them in the crawl space or something, they're going to stink too bad.
[19:30.900 --> 19:31.980]  That's the easy way out.
[19:31.980 --> 19:33.180]  That is definitely the easy way.
[19:33.180 --> 19:37.420]  If you can prevent the aroma, I would just drag them all to another space.
[19:37.420 --> 19:41.460]  But I don't know if you've got the ability to hide these plants and hide the aroma from
[19:41.460 --> 19:46.180]  the ... It's a home inspection from the ... You're renting, so it's the landlord probably.
[19:46.180 --> 19:49.500]  I don't know how thorough their inspection is going to be.
[19:49.900 --> 19:52.300]  It depends on the rest of the house.
[19:52.300 --> 19:53.300]  You know what I mean?
[19:53.300 --> 19:56.300]  If you walk in and the living room looks really good and it's all vacuumed and there's a blanket
[19:56.300 --> 20:00.220]  over the couch and pillows on the couch like civilized humans live there.
[20:00.220 --> 20:04.100]  There's not piles of beer cans and fucking cigarette butts everywhere.
[20:04.100 --> 20:06.500]  You can have a beer can and a cigarette, but I mean like piled up in the corner.
[20:06.500 --> 20:10.300]  You shouldn't have fucking recyclable cans just piled up over there like it's a fucking
[20:10.300 --> 20:11.380]  sculpture.
[20:11.380 --> 20:13.340]  That's when the landlord's going to want to look around and see more.
[20:13.340 --> 20:15.340]  They're like, how much are they ruining my house?
[20:15.340 --> 20:19.340]  But if you go in and you got some house plants that look decent and you got, like I said,
[20:19.340 --> 20:21.780]  a blanket on the couch that's folded, you know what I mean?
[20:21.780 --> 20:24.900]  Like nice people put a blanket over the top of the couch and just clean it up.
[20:24.900 --> 20:27.220]  Don't clean up the toilets so there's not piss everywhere.
[20:27.220 --> 20:30.220]  Just make them think that you're doing a little bit of work on the house, keeping it looking
[20:30.220 --> 20:31.220]  good.
[20:31.220 --> 20:32.220]  When they walk through, they'll go, nah, we're out of here.
[20:32.220 --> 20:33.420]  This looks good.
[20:33.420 --> 20:34.820]  But who knows what they're going to do?
[20:34.820 --> 20:36.300]  They could climb under everything.
[20:36.300 --> 20:37.300]  They could get in stuff.
[20:37.300 --> 20:40.700]  So I would consider renting a moving van.
[20:40.700 --> 20:41.700]  Here we call it a U-Haul.
[20:41.700 --> 20:45.740]  I don't know what you call it there, but that's probably something similar, a Penske or something.
[20:45.740 --> 20:47.520]  The big box truck, just load them in there.
[20:47.520 --> 20:49.180]  Maybe you can rent something smaller.
[20:49.220 --> 20:51.260]  Throw them in there for the time being.
[20:51.260 --> 20:54.700]  But you got to think about climate and temperature control in there.
[20:54.700 --> 20:57.740]  You also have to think about security of the plants while they're in there.
[20:57.740 --> 20:58.740]  You got to pay for the truck.
[20:58.740 --> 21:00.540]  There's a lot of things to think about there.
[21:00.540 --> 21:05.100]  So I probably would rent that truck and throw them in there.
[21:05.100 --> 21:06.620]  This is why I recommend a grow tent.
[21:06.620 --> 21:10.980]  A lot of people are not fans of grow tents, but if you had two grow tents, you could just
[21:10.980 --> 21:14.300]  move the plants, move the tents, take everything out, then put it all back.
[21:14.300 --> 21:18.060]  Right now what you've got to do is get rid of the plants, then all the gear possibly.
[21:18.060 --> 21:19.180]  You got to move all the gear too.
[21:19.180 --> 21:20.180]  They can't see the equipment.
[21:20.180 --> 21:22.940]  Then you got to clean up the floor.
[21:22.940 --> 21:24.140]  You got to clean up all of the evidence.
[21:24.140 --> 21:26.660]  You can't have any leaves, no nutrient bottles.
[21:26.660 --> 21:27.660]  Get rid of all of it.
[21:27.660 --> 21:29.780]  So be very strategic.
[21:29.780 --> 21:33.620]  The more I talk about it, the more I see you putting all of this into a moving van because
[21:33.620 --> 21:39.100]  you got to load up everything, all the gear, nothing can be spotted because one small thing
[21:39.100 --> 21:43.500]  will make them think that you're growing in there if they do a deep enough oven inspection.
[21:43.500 --> 21:44.500]  So that's the first part.
[21:44.500 --> 21:46.300]  I'd go with the truck if that's an option.
[21:46.300 --> 21:48.100]  I'd go rent the moving van and do that.
[21:48.100 --> 21:52.100]  Then it says, because I'm a renter, I'm unable to scrog my plants in case of having to move
[21:52.100 --> 21:53.100]  them.
[21:53.100 --> 21:58.300]  Would a scrog method be more beneficial or would you recommend another technique?
[21:58.300 --> 22:00.620]  You already know that you may have to move these plants.
[22:00.620 --> 22:02.060]  Excuse me for the throat clearing.
[22:02.060 --> 22:03.060]  I do apologize.
[22:03.060 --> 22:05.220]  It's very unprofessional, but it's already happening.
[22:05.220 --> 22:07.340]  So what am I going to do?
[22:07.340 --> 22:09.180]  We already know that you may have to move the plants.
[22:09.180 --> 22:10.180]  You've got to do it.
[22:10.180 --> 22:11.180]  So a scrog would have screwed you.
[22:11.180 --> 22:12.180]  You would have been fucked.
[22:12.180 --> 22:13.180]  You couldn't get the plant.
[22:13.180 --> 22:15.200]  You would not be able to get them out of there to move them.
[22:15.200 --> 22:18.040]  So that would have caused you much more problems.
[22:18.040 --> 22:22.720]  So I think maybe if you can individually scrog each plant, I don't know how big your pots
[22:22.720 --> 22:23.720]  are.
[22:23.720 --> 22:27.320]  If you've got something bigger than a seven or a 10-gallon pot, you can put sticks in
[22:27.320 --> 22:31.000]  the corners and make like a scrog out of those sticks and kind of control the plant with
[22:31.000 --> 22:34.160]  that one or use a tomato cage or start topping it.
[22:34.160 --> 22:38.980]  But you absolutely are correct that a scrog may not be beneficial.
[22:38.980 --> 22:41.160]  Another technique, maybe just tomato cages.
[22:41.160 --> 22:42.360]  Tomato cages are great.
[22:42.360 --> 22:45.000]  I've seen people use tomato cages on your Australian.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.800]  So I don't know if you call them the same thing.
[22:46.800 --> 22:51.480]  It's three hoops with three legs and you just shove the legs down into the soil.
[22:51.480 --> 22:55.680]  The plants start to grow up and then you just pull the branches underneath the horizontal
[22:55.680 --> 22:56.680]  hoops.
[22:56.680 --> 23:00.200]  Just pull the branches underneath there so that it gets more space and more airflow.
[23:00.200 --> 23:03.200]  Or you can also flip that tomato cage upside down.
[23:03.200 --> 23:04.280]  Be careful with that pointy end.
[23:04.280 --> 23:05.280]  Those will go in your eye.
[23:05.280 --> 23:06.280]  Cut those off.
[23:06.280 --> 23:08.520]  And you can use those hoops the same way to spread it out.
[23:08.520 --> 23:10.280]  You can also use a lot of bamboo sticks.
[23:10.280 --> 23:15.520]  I see people put bamboo sticks around the pot and then just use that to tie the branches
[23:15.520 --> 23:18.160]  down to the sticks or just affix it to the sticks.
[23:18.160 --> 23:22.240]  Also they make a lot of those new LST clips is what I think they call them.
[23:22.240 --> 23:25.560]  So we can bend the branch over and just put a little clip on it and you can shape the
[23:25.560 --> 23:27.200]  branches by using these little clips.
[23:27.200 --> 23:29.640]  Those are great tools if you learn how to use those.
[23:29.640 --> 23:33.960]  But we definitely know that scrogging is not part of the options.
[23:33.960 --> 23:34.960]  Let's see.
[23:34.960 --> 23:35.960]  It wraps up.
[23:35.960 --> 23:36.960]  It says, I love the podcast.
[23:36.960 --> 23:39.480]  It keeps me going on my 12-hour shifts at work.
[23:39.480 --> 23:42.280]  Much love from Aussie Dank Grower.
[23:42.280 --> 23:44.520]  Aussie bro, thank you for the great message.
[23:44.520 --> 23:45.880]  I hope I helped you out a little bit.
[23:45.880 --> 23:50.180]  I do look forward to the feedback on how you're growing.
[23:50.180 --> 23:51.960]  Maybe a picture, maybe some details.
[23:51.960 --> 23:55.880]  Then we can figure out how to kind of scrog and spread your plants out just a little bit
[23:55.880 --> 23:56.880]  more.
[23:56.880 --> 23:57.880]  Get some more light.
[23:57.880 --> 23:58.880]  Get a bigger harvest for you.
[23:58.880 --> 23:59.880]  All right.
[23:59.880 --> 24:03.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.200]  cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there, I do want
[24:07.200 --> 24:13.640]  to thank you once again for listening to episode 746 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[24:28.160 --> 24:29.240]  Everything else is on the website.
[24:29.240 --> 24:30.840]  There's a lot of stuff to think about.
[24:30.840 --> 24:32.200]  There are seed vendors.
[24:32.200 --> 24:33.600]  There's a merch link.
[24:33.600 --> 24:34.980]  There's a Discord link.
[24:34.980 --> 24:36.720]  All the good stuff is on the website.
[24:36.720 --> 24:38.480]  It's at ierygenetics.com.
[24:38.480 --> 24:39.480]  All right.
[24:39.480 --> 24:40.480]  My voice is burning out.
[24:40.480 --> 24:42.120]  It is time to wrap up this show.
[24:42.120 --> 24:44.200]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[24:44.200 --> 24:47.800]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend, Curbside Gardens.
[24:47.800 --> 24:51.080]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
