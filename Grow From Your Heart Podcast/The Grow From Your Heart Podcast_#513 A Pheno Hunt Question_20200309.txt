[00:38.320 --> 00:41.200]  You know I like to start the show by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:41.200 --> 00:47.560]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:47.560 --> 00:55.640]  The label on the package says that this product contains 72.9% THC and 84.7% total cannabinoids.
[00:55.720 --> 00:59.240]  I'm going to crack it open and give you a fresh smell.
[00:59.240 --> 01:03.220]  It smells gassy, it smells earthy, and it smells funky.
[01:03.220 --> 01:08.000]  This is one of my favorite aromas, one of my favorite flavors, and I for sure love the
[01:08.000 --> 01:09.000]  stony buzz.
[01:09.000 --> 01:11.640]  It makes me nice and relaxed, makes me nice and mellow.
[01:11.640 --> 01:14.320]  I'm kind of jello here in the chair while I'm recording.
[01:14.320 --> 01:16.120]  Just chilled out, not going anywhere.
[01:16.120 --> 01:18.400]  Got my shoes off, nice and comfy.
[01:18.400 --> 01:24.120]  Big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Malibu Pure Kush Ambrosia.
[01:24.840 --> 01:28.720]  Alright, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.440]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of our friends who support the show
[01:33.440 --> 01:35.000]  on Patreon.

[01:44.240 --> 01:46.220]  a fist bump to Karen Crawford.
[01:46.220 --> 01:49.000]  Let's roll a big ol' fat joint for our buddy Sam.
[01:49.000 --> 01:52.020]  Let's heat up a big fat dab for my buddy Farmer John.
[01:52.020 --> 01:56.460]  How about a big Grow From Your Heart Podcast bong rip for my buddy Dabby Hayes.
[01:56.460 --> 02:01.260]  Let's send a big thank you shout out and a big fat joint over to my buddy Mason662.

[02:05.520 --> 02:07.460]  handshake to my buddy Aldridge.

[02:11.580 --> 02:16.580]  And last, but certainly not least, I want to smoke a big fat Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[02:16.580 --> 02:21.980]  joint with my buddy Bobby C. Big shout out, big thank you to everybody who supports the

[02:44.900 --> 02:48.900]  All right, I've got one more thing I want to talk about and give thanks for before I
[02:48.900 --> 02:52.200]  move on to the email portion of this episode.
[02:52.200 --> 02:53.900]  But last week was my birthday.
[02:53.900 --> 02:55.460]  Sunday was officially my birthday.
[02:55.460 --> 02:58.020]  I have been having an amazing birthday week.
[02:58.020 --> 03:01.460]  Big shout out, big thanks to all of my friends who've been spoiling me and spending time
[03:01.460 --> 03:02.460]  with me and hanging out.
[03:02.460 --> 03:06.180]  Make sure I'm having a smile on my face and well-fed and heavily medicated.
[03:06.180 --> 03:10.020]  It has been a great week, but the birthday week has continued.
[03:10.020 --> 03:11.160]  It has not slowed down.
[03:11.160 --> 03:13.140]  It has not stopped yet.
[03:13.140 --> 03:17.500]  On Wednesday, I was hanging out doing my chores and I got a phone call from an unfamiliar
[03:17.500 --> 03:18.500]  number.
[03:19.100 --> 03:20.100]  I said, hey, is this Jeff?
[03:20.100 --> 03:21.100]  And I said, that's me.
[03:21.100 --> 03:23.020]  And they said, hey, it's this guy from Comedy Works.
[03:23.020 --> 03:25.500]  I'm not going to say his name, but he said, it's me from Comedy Works.
[03:25.500 --> 03:26.820]  You know why I'm calling.
[03:26.820 --> 03:29.780]  And I said, oh shit, did you guys get me tickets?
[03:29.780 --> 03:31.020]  And they said, happy birthday, buddy.
[03:31.020 --> 03:34.340]  We got you two tickets for Tom Segura tonight at Comedy Works.
[03:34.340 --> 03:36.100]  And I said, holy shit.
[03:36.100 --> 03:38.260]  I live about two hours from Comedy Works.
[03:38.260 --> 03:41.440]  So I had to regroup my day, rearrange my plans.
[03:41.440 --> 03:42.860]  That didn't take much effort.
[03:42.860 --> 03:46.860]  But I knew that my next mission was to call Clint and make sure that Clint could get off
[03:46.860 --> 03:49.700]  of work early so that we could travel up to Denver.
[03:49.700 --> 03:50.700]  So I made the quick call.
[03:50.700 --> 03:53.500]  I said, Clint, bro, I've got a major emergency.
[03:53.500 --> 03:54.500]  Comedy Works just called.
[03:54.500 --> 03:56.740]  I've got two tickets to see Tommy Segura tonight.
[03:56.740 --> 04:00.020]  I would love for you to be my buddy for the show.
[04:00.020 --> 04:01.920]  And he said, I'll be there, bro.
[04:01.920 --> 04:04.620]  So Clint showed up to my house around 3.30.
[04:04.620 --> 04:08.140]  Allegedly, we may or may not have gotten a little bit medicated.
[04:08.140 --> 04:10.160]  We made the adventure up to Denver.
[04:10.160 --> 04:13.340]  Traffic was kind of a little bitch that night, but we made it right on time.
[04:13.340 --> 04:15.680]  I wanted to be at the parking lot at 6.30.
[04:15.680 --> 04:17.400]  We were there at 6.28.
[04:17.400 --> 04:21.320]  I may or may not have taken a gigantic dab in the car.
[04:21.320 --> 04:24.120]  Then we made it into the Comedy Works venue.
[04:24.120 --> 04:26.280]  We were given amazing seats.
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.760]  Big shout out, big thanks to all of my friends at Comedy Works.
[04:29.760 --> 04:34.600]  Comedy Works is, in my opinion, one of the best two comedy clubs on the planet.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.960]  And they treat me like a VIP rock star every time I go there.
[04:37.960 --> 04:39.400]  They all remember my name.
[04:39.400 --> 04:40.400]  They greet me by name.
[04:40.400 --> 04:42.160]  They all have a smile on their face.
[04:42.160 --> 04:45.300]  They remember what I order when I get snacks and drinks.
[04:45.780 --> 04:48.500]  Big shout out to that club for taking such good care of me.
[04:48.500 --> 04:52.700]  Big shout out to Comedy Works for calling me with tickets for my birthday.
[04:52.700 --> 04:54.420]  That was super awesome and super kind of them.
[04:54.420 --> 04:56.180]  I do appreciate that.
[04:56.180 --> 05:00.020]  Then also, big shout out to Clint for being able to get off work a little bit early and
[05:00.020 --> 05:02.620]  make it to an awesome comedy show.
[05:02.620 --> 05:05.780]  Tom Segura made it clear that he did not have a lot of new material.
[05:05.780 --> 05:07.580]  He just put out a comedy special.
[05:07.580 --> 05:10.180]  So he's got an hour of brand new material out there.
[05:10.180 --> 05:11.460]  It's available on Netflix.
[05:11.460 --> 05:13.220]  Really soon, you'll be able to watch that.
[05:13.260 --> 05:17.060]  But when a comedian puts out a special, they don't do that material anymore.
[05:17.060 --> 05:18.060]  That's like old shit.
[05:18.060 --> 05:21.900]  You don't want to go to the comedy club and see the special that you just watched on Netflix.
[05:21.900 --> 05:25.260]  So he is working on a brand new hour of material.
[05:25.260 --> 05:29.820]  He stopped at the Comedy Works in Denver to run some of his new jokes by us.
[05:29.820 --> 05:33.260]  Most of his new material is fucking hilarious.
[05:33.260 --> 05:37.700]  A couple of jokes were kind of duds, but it was even funnier watching Tom Segura throw
[05:37.700 --> 05:40.780]  out a joke that was kind of like, eh, that needs work, bro.
[05:40.780 --> 05:43.100]  But he would look at the crowd and be like, is there something there?
[05:43.180 --> 05:44.180]  And it was just real funny.
[05:44.180 --> 05:46.900]  It's a small club, so he can see all of our faces.
[05:46.900 --> 05:48.380]  It's a real intimate experience.
[05:48.380 --> 05:49.860]  I thought it was great.
[05:49.860 --> 05:54.020]  Big thanks to Tom Segura for dropping into the Comedy Works on a Wednesday night just
[05:54.020 --> 05:57.540]  to come run some new material by us and see if it was funny.
[05:57.540 --> 05:59.060]  Dude, that shit was funny.
[05:59.060 --> 06:03.980]  Also, let's give a big shout out to Adam Clayton Holland for being an amazing opening act.
[06:03.980 --> 06:05.260]  That dude crushed it.
[06:05.260 --> 06:07.140]  He does a bit about Guinness beer.
[06:07.140 --> 06:10.900]  I'm not going to blow any of the bit, but that bit is fucking hilarious.
[06:11.220 --> 06:14.980]  Dude, if you happen to hear this, I was laughing until I was pissing my pants.
[06:14.980 --> 06:18.220]  And then when you do the bro and the dude voice, bro, that could be me.
[06:18.220 --> 06:20.140]  You might be doing my voice.
[06:20.140 --> 06:21.980]  That was fucking funny to me.
[06:21.980 --> 06:26.100]  Then also, I want to give a big shout out and a thank you to Brant Tobler.
[06:26.100 --> 06:28.300]  Brant Tobler is an amazing comedian.
[06:28.300 --> 06:29.420]  He's from Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[06:29.420 --> 06:31.140]  He is now based in Denver, Colorado.
[06:31.140 --> 06:34.340]  He's a Comedy Works local, a Comedy Works regular.
[06:34.340 --> 06:38.020]  He does a lot of works with the Comedy Works crew, a lot of opening work there, a lot of
[06:38.020 --> 06:39.020]  headlining work.
[06:39.140 --> 06:40.780]  He also got a podcast.
[06:40.780 --> 06:43.500]  Big shout out to everybody who performed on the stage that night.
[06:43.500 --> 06:45.380]  They all did an amazing job.
[06:45.380 --> 06:50.260]  You guys, I cannot tell you how exciting it was to get a call from somebody saying, hey,
[06:50.260 --> 06:54.940]  bro, we got you two tickets to see Tom Segura tonight because that show sold out in about
[06:54.940 --> 06:55.940]  30 seconds.
[06:55.940 --> 06:59.460]  I got an email saying, Tommy's going to go on sale today at this time.
[06:59.460 --> 07:01.100]  Make sure you've got your computer ready.
[07:01.100 --> 07:02.100]  I was ready.
[07:02.100 --> 07:03.900]  I was clicking and clicking and clicking and clicking.
[07:03.900 --> 07:06.380]  And by the time I got through it, tickets were sold out.
[07:06.380 --> 07:07.940]  So I was really blessed.
[07:07.940 --> 07:10.780]  I felt really privileged to have gotten tickets to that show.
[07:10.780 --> 07:11.780]  It was a fucking good time.
[07:11.780 --> 07:14.180]  I'm going to quit bragging about that.
[07:14.180 --> 07:18.500]  Let's take a dab and then let's read some emails from our listeners.
[07:18.500 --> 07:20.860]  You guys, I'm going to press pause so you don't have to listen to the torch and all
[07:20.860 --> 07:23.780]  that bullshit, but I am going to take a big fat dab.
[07:23.780 --> 07:28.380]  And when I get back, we are going to read some emails from some listeners.
[07:28.380 --> 07:29.380]  Dab something, you guys.
[07:29.380 --> 07:39.890]  I'll be right back.
[07:39.890 --> 07:43.290]  And that is what it sounds like in my head right now.
[07:43.290 --> 07:44.290]  Welcome back, everybody.
[07:44.290 --> 07:47.570]  I just took a ridiculous dab of the Malibu Pure Kush.
[07:47.570 --> 07:51.050]  Kind of feels like I am swimming underwater while I'm sitting here at this table.
[07:51.050 --> 07:53.690]  Feels like I put a little, like I cemented my face down.
[07:53.690 --> 07:55.010]  My eyes are super heavy.
[07:55.010 --> 07:57.570]  My arms are super ridiculously heavy.
[07:57.570 --> 08:00.930]  I kind of wish I had a seatbelt on my chair right now.
[08:00.930 --> 08:02.410]  I think I'm going to be okay.
[08:02.410 --> 08:06.390]  I am going to move forward to the email portion of this podcast.
[08:06.390 --> 08:10.370]  If anybody out there has a cannabis culture or cannabis cultivation question, I would
[08:10.370 --> 08:11.370]  love to hear from you.
[08:11.490 --> 08:15.250]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:15.250 --> 08:19.730]  The first email on today's episode goes just like this.
[08:19.730 --> 08:23.490]  It says, hello, I am on day 60 of Flower with Orangegasm.
[08:23.490 --> 08:25.970]  The plants look and smell amazing.
[08:25.970 --> 08:31.570]  My question is, does day one of flowers start the day you flipped at 1212 or when you see
[08:31.570 --> 08:33.210]  the first flowers?
[08:33.210 --> 08:35.370]  My next grow will be Lemon Jeffery.
[08:35.370 --> 08:36.610]  I'm looking forward to that one.
[08:36.610 --> 08:39.090]  I really enjoy your podcast.
[08:39.090 --> 08:40.210]  They did not sign their name.
[08:40.210 --> 08:42.650]  I don't know if they want their name said on the show.
[08:42.650 --> 08:43.650]  They know who they are.
[08:43.650 --> 08:45.650]  Big shout out, big thank you for the great question.
[08:45.650 --> 08:50.450]  I get this question a lot, so I will try to answer it very clearly right now.
[08:50.450 --> 08:56.850]  When you are working in an indoor environment, day one of flower is when you flip those lights
[08:56.850 --> 09:01.810]  to 1212 or whatever desired flowering cycle you are going to work with.
[09:01.810 --> 09:03.090]  That is day one.
[09:03.090 --> 09:05.490]  That's when you start counting day one of flower.
[09:05.490 --> 09:11.330]  If I've recommended 60 to 70 days, that is when the day one begins is when you change
[09:11.330 --> 09:13.130]  the light cycle.
[09:13.130 --> 09:18.210]  In most cases, you're not going to see any flowers or pre-flowers until around day 10,
[09:18.210 --> 09:21.330]  12, 14, maybe a little bit further in.
[09:21.330 --> 09:27.490]  If you start counting that as day one, you are already 10, 12, or 14 days behind schedule.
[09:27.490 --> 09:28.490]  You are way off.
[09:28.490 --> 09:29.970]  None of your feed charts are going to match.
[09:29.970 --> 09:32.970]  None of the recommendations I make are going to match.
[09:32.970 --> 09:39.890]  Day one is when you flip those lights to your 1212 or your 1113 flowering cycle.
[09:39.890 --> 09:43.890]  They wrap this message up by saying, my next grow will be Lemon Jeffrey, and I look forward
[09:43.890 --> 09:44.890]  to that one.
[09:44.890 --> 09:46.530]  I look forward to that one as well.
[09:46.530 --> 09:50.570]  I hope to see pictures of the Orange Gasm and the Lemon Jeffrey.
[09:50.570 --> 09:54.450]  You can send them to me at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[09:54.450 --> 09:59.530]  Hey, thank you for the great message, and I do look forward to those photos.
[09:59.530 --> 10:00.530]  All right.
[10:00.530 --> 10:01.770]  I'm going to keep this show moving.
[10:01.770 --> 10:06.090]  The next email in today's episode goes just like this.
[10:06.090 --> 10:09.330]  It says, Rasta, thank you for the bounty of information.
[10:09.330 --> 10:11.170]  Hey, you are very welcome.
[10:11.170 --> 10:13.330]  Thank you for listening and for all of the support.
[10:13.330 --> 10:16.570]  I recognize your name here, so thank you for the support.
[10:16.570 --> 10:20.770]  It goes on to say, I have started collecting and popping your seeds.
[10:20.770 --> 10:22.050]  I really appreciate that.
[10:22.050 --> 10:26.250]  I love that you're popping the seeds, and I really love that people are collecting the
[10:26.250 --> 10:29.650]  seeds and the genetics that I have made and created.
[10:29.770 --> 10:33.330]  I did not know that would be a thing when I started making seeds for people.
[10:33.330 --> 10:37.290]  I didn't know when I put packages out that people would stash them and hoard them and
[10:37.290 --> 10:41.650]  try to collect all of them like Pokemon or baseball cards, but I love that people are
[10:41.650 --> 10:43.290]  trying to catch them all.
[10:43.290 --> 10:44.770]  That really means a lot to me.
[10:44.770 --> 10:46.330]  I'm going to keep going on the email.
[10:46.330 --> 10:53.410]  It says, while I'm on a pheno hunt, should I top these first run seed plants or not?
[10:53.410 --> 10:56.470]  I normally top my clones two to three times.
[10:56.470 --> 11:00.270]  Will I be affecting these seed plants by topping them because I am looking for the
[11:00.270 --> 11:05.510]  best one, but I'm thinking maybe I should let them go naturally during the pheno hunt.
[11:05.510 --> 11:11.150]  During the pheno hunt, my plan was to top thinking I could get more side growth for
[11:11.150 --> 11:12.150]  cloning.
[11:12.150 --> 11:14.430]  I would love your view on this topic.
[11:14.430 --> 11:17.230]  Thank you from Scott from Clayton, Washington.
[11:17.230 --> 11:21.190]  Hey, big shout out to my new buddy Scott out there in Clayton, Washington.
[11:21.190 --> 11:27.390]  Let's talk a little bit about topping or not topping our pheno hunt plants.
[11:27.390 --> 11:29.330]  This is a very good question.
[11:29.330 --> 11:33.650]  Some people may not understand what I'm talking about when it comes to talking about topping
[11:33.650 --> 11:34.930]  and pheno hunting.
[11:34.930 --> 11:37.030]  So let's do a little bit of a catch up.
[11:37.030 --> 11:40.910]  This person has purchased a pack of seeds and they are running the seeds.
[11:40.910 --> 11:44.530]  They don't know which of those seeds are going to be the keepers.
[11:44.530 --> 11:48.830]  There may be a really stellar plant that works really well for this person's garden or their
[11:48.830 --> 11:51.730]  medical condition or whatever they are looking for.
[11:51.730 --> 11:54.550]  That plant may be in this package of seeds.
[11:54.550 --> 11:59.510]  There will be genetic variation amongst each seed in that package.
[11:59.510 --> 12:05.010]  So when we run a seed pack for the first time, our main goal with that first run is to find
[12:05.010 --> 12:07.750]  the keeper in that pack that works for you.
[12:07.750 --> 12:10.250]  You do that by doing what is called a pheno hunt.
[12:10.250 --> 12:15.930]  You grow your seeds, you take notes, you take pictures, you document the grow, then you
[12:15.930 --> 12:20.610]  harvest those plants and you smoke them and you document which one you like the best.
[12:20.610 --> 12:24.690]  Hopefully the one that grew the best for you and produced the best and was the easiest
[12:24.690 --> 12:29.390]  to function and work with is the one that smokes the best also, but that is very rarely
[12:29.390 --> 12:30.490]  the case.
[12:30.490 --> 12:33.810]  So this person is going through the process that we call a pheno hunt.
[12:33.810 --> 12:37.530]  They're going to sprout their seeds, they're going to veg them, then they're going to flower
[12:37.530 --> 12:40.890]  them, then they will dry them and cure them and smoke them and they'll see which plant
[12:40.890 --> 12:43.230]  works the best for their needs.
[12:43.230 --> 12:47.670]  Then they will probably eliminate the remaining plants and keep that one plant to work with
[12:47.670 --> 12:48.870]  for the future.
[12:48.870 --> 12:53.310]  That way they can take clones from that one plant and have reliable medicine over and
[12:53.310 --> 12:54.310]  over again.
[12:54.310 --> 12:58.710]  They can develop a relationship with this one plant and learn how much calcium it likes,
[12:58.710 --> 13:02.110]  how much potassium it likes, exactly how long to flower it.
[13:02.110 --> 13:06.670]  You can learn the quirks and ticks of each plant by growing it multiple times and developing
[13:06.670 --> 13:08.190]  a relationship with it.
[13:08.190 --> 13:12.070]  So this person is in the process of starting a pheno hunt.
[13:12.470 --> 13:17.230]  The other part of this question is, do they want to top their plants during a pheno hunt?
[13:17.230 --> 13:18.750]  They don't know what they've got.
[13:18.750 --> 13:23.630]  They would like to see the full potential of these plants and they don't want to lessen
[13:23.630 --> 13:28.230]  or degrade the outcome of these plants by doing any sort of experimental tactics to
[13:28.230 --> 13:29.230]  them.
[13:29.230 --> 13:31.830]  So their question is, should they top these plants?
[13:31.830 --> 13:33.910]  Because a topped plant will produce more.
[13:33.910 --> 13:37.950]  A topped plant will give you, if it's done correctly and properly timed, a topped plant
[13:37.950 --> 13:40.030]  will give you more product, more buds.
[13:40.190 --> 13:44.430]  It will also give you more branching because this listener said they wanted to top it to
[13:44.430 --> 13:50.430]  create more branching to get more side growth for cloning, which does make great sense.
[13:50.430 --> 13:56.190]  So the question here is, do I top my pheno hunt plants from seeds when I don't know what
[13:56.190 --> 14:00.590]  I'm working with, but I would still like to see their full potential?
[14:00.590 --> 14:04.910]  Now I did reply through email to this listener because I did not want them to have to wait
[14:04.910 --> 14:08.690]  for me to put this podcast together to get some useful advice out of me.
[14:08.690 --> 14:13.730]  What I said was, my quick answer is that if you intend to top your plants in the next
[14:13.730 --> 14:16.290]  runs, top them as pheno hunters.
[14:16.290 --> 14:21.990]  If you generally don't top your plants in the next runs, don't top them as pheno hunters.
[14:21.990 --> 14:26.130]  So if you do top, top them because that's what you're going to be doing in your environment.
[14:26.130 --> 14:29.170]  We need to know if these plants work when you top them.
[14:29.170 --> 14:31.370]  If that's what you normally do, do it.
[14:31.370 --> 14:34.550]  If it's not what you normally do, don't do it.
[14:34.550 --> 14:39.110]  This advice only applies if you are running a test garden for yourself.
[14:39.110 --> 14:44.510]  If you are running a test grow for a breeder, such as myself or any other breeder who has
[14:44.510 --> 14:50.110]  gifted you seeds with the intention of feedback, whether that's in the form of photos or grow
[14:50.110 --> 14:54.750]  reports or maybe you smoke some of the finished product with them, if you are running tester
[14:54.750 --> 14:57.750]  seeds for a breeder, do not top them.
[14:57.750 --> 14:59.890]  Do not do any weird shit to them.
[14:59.890 --> 15:04.290]  Do not do any weird experimentation on tester seeds.
[15:04.290 --> 15:06.670]  Put all of the test seeds in a grow room.
[15:06.670 --> 15:08.350]  Give them all the same environment.
[15:08.350 --> 15:10.030]  Give them all the same treatment.
[15:10.030 --> 15:12.710]  Do the exact same thing to all of them.
[15:12.710 --> 15:16.070]  Veg them just long enough to make them grow.
[15:16.070 --> 15:17.930]  Flower them out immediately.
[15:17.930 --> 15:19.350]  Take a lot of photos.
[15:19.350 --> 15:20.670]  Take a lot of notes.
[15:20.670 --> 15:23.110]  Get those notes and photos to the breeder.
[15:23.110 --> 15:27.210]  Get them dried and cured and finished up as soon as possible so that you can smoke them
[15:27.210 --> 15:30.870]  so that you can give your breeder a quality smoke report.
[15:30.870 --> 15:34.890]  We want to find out if the seeds we created are worth a shit and we need to know pretty
[15:34.890 --> 15:35.890]  quickly.
[15:35.890 --> 15:39.570]  We don't need them topped and twisted and lollipopped and trellised out.
[15:39.570 --> 15:42.610]  We don't need nine weeks worth of work on a tester plant.
[15:42.610 --> 15:43.610]  We want that done.
[15:43.610 --> 15:48.010]  I think you can veg for 30, 45 days, then flip them.
[15:48.010 --> 15:54.530]  In a perfect world, my test seeds are done in 90 to 120 days for a full cycle.
[15:54.530 --> 15:55.530]  That is germination.
[15:55.530 --> 15:56.530]  That is veg.
[15:56.530 --> 15:57.530]  That is flower.
[15:57.530 --> 16:00.290]  Then you cut them down, dry them, cure them, smoke them.
[16:00.710 --> 16:05.190]  So if you are running a phenohunt for yourself and you're looking for something that works
[16:05.190 --> 16:10.790]  well in your garden, do to those phenohunting plants what you're going to do to them in
[16:10.790 --> 16:12.090]  your main garden.
[16:12.090 --> 16:15.270]  We need to know how they're going to perform under that environment.
[16:15.270 --> 16:17.630]  But those seeds you probably paid money for.
[16:17.630 --> 16:18.990]  We know that they're reliable.
[16:18.990 --> 16:20.110]  They've been tested.
[16:20.110 --> 16:21.510]  We know they're not hermaphrodites.
[16:21.510 --> 16:22.950]  We know they're not a bunch of mutants.
[16:22.950 --> 16:26.750]  We know that there are going to be a good ratio of male to females in those seeds.
[16:26.750 --> 16:30.010]  So those seeds, it is okay to dedicate some time to.
[16:30.010 --> 16:32.090]  Do some work with them if you want to.
[16:32.090 --> 16:35.850]  The tester seeds, don't spend a lot of time on them because we don't know if those are
[16:35.850 --> 16:36.850]  hermaphrodites.
[16:36.850 --> 16:37.910]  We don't know if they're mutants.
[16:37.910 --> 16:39.530]  Those could be all boys.
[16:39.530 --> 16:41.450]  They could just be trash genetics.
[16:41.450 --> 16:45.170]  We don't know what we have created when we send you testers, and we're relying on the
[16:45.170 --> 16:47.850]  testers to give us quality results.
[16:47.850 --> 16:52.090]  We really don't want to wait eight weeks for you to veg a plant out and mainline it, do
[16:52.090 --> 16:53.570]  all kinds of weird shit.
[16:53.570 --> 16:56.910]  And then we find out you only did two of them and we sent you 20 seeds.
[16:56.910 --> 16:59.870]  We were really hoping you did 20 of them side by side.
[16:59.870 --> 17:01.390]  Just did them real small.
[17:01.390 --> 17:02.510]  Don't do a lot of experiments.
[17:02.510 --> 17:04.670]  The experiment is, are these worth a shit?
[17:04.670 --> 17:06.710]  We want to find out if they're any good.
[17:06.710 --> 17:10.510]  So those are two different types of phenohunting environments.
[17:10.510 --> 17:15.450]  In both environments, I do recommend you treat all plants the same.
[17:15.450 --> 17:19.550]  If you are phenohunting and you feed this plant one thing and this plant another, how
[17:19.550 --> 17:22.830]  do you know if that plant is better and that plant is not better?
[17:22.850 --> 17:26.450]  That's like giving me steroids and the guy that I've got to fight, not giving him steroids.
[17:26.450 --> 17:29.170]  I'm going to kick the shit out of him because I'm on steroids.
[17:29.170 --> 17:32.130]  If you give both of us steroids, it's still a fair fight.
[17:32.130 --> 17:34.970]  If you don't give either one of us steroids, it's still a fair fight.
[17:34.970 --> 17:36.170]  I would never take steroids, guys.
[17:36.170 --> 17:38.330]  I just picked a weird way to describe that.
[17:38.330 --> 17:43.910]  But when you were doing phenohunts, when you were doing testing, feed everything the same.
[17:43.910 --> 17:45.470]  Treat every plant the same.
[17:45.470 --> 17:48.890]  If you're going to lollipop one plant, lollipop all of the other plants.
[17:48.890 --> 17:51.530]  If you're going to top one, top all of the others.
[17:51.550 --> 17:55.470]  When you do a phenohunt or testing, keep it scientific.
[17:55.470 --> 18:00.150]  Make sure that all of the plants get the same treatment so we get a reliable outcome.
[18:00.150 --> 18:01.430]  That is my point here.
[18:01.430 --> 18:05.470]  So the short answer is if you're going to top your plants in all of the future runs,
[18:05.470 --> 18:06.710]  top your phenohunters.
[18:06.710 --> 18:11.010]  If you plan on letting them grow that one glory bud, don't top them and see how they
[18:11.010 --> 18:13.590]  go with that one big glory bud.
[18:13.590 --> 18:17.710]  And quickly, I'll tell you how I do phenohunts and I do them in a couple of different ways.
[18:17.710 --> 18:21.690]  If I'm trying to find a mother plant and I know that I'm going to keep something around,
[18:21.690 --> 18:23.810]  I generally veg in three gallon pots.
[18:23.810 --> 18:27.250]  I veg until they're about just a little bit taller than my knee.
[18:27.250 --> 18:28.250]  I'm a tall person.
[18:28.250 --> 18:31.730]  I'm six foot five, so my knee may be a little bit taller than yours.
[18:31.730 --> 18:35.290]  But I veg until the plants are probably, I'm guessing they're about table high.
[18:35.290 --> 18:37.490]  I veg until they're the height of this table.
[18:37.490 --> 18:38.730]  At that point, I top them.
[18:38.730 --> 18:42.090]  I take the main top out of the plant and make a clone from that.
[18:42.090 --> 18:46.010]  I generally clean up the bottoms of the plants just a little bit before flower anyway.
[18:46.010 --> 18:48.630]  So I will take two clones off the bottoms of each plant.
[18:48.630 --> 18:52.670]  So now I've got three clones off of every plant so that if I do find a keeper, I've
[18:52.670 --> 18:56.970]  got three opportunities to keep that bad dog around for future runs.
[18:56.970 --> 18:59.350]  So I veg my original plant to about knee high.
[18:59.350 --> 19:00.510]  I take the top out of it.
[19:00.510 --> 19:02.030]  I make a clone from that top.
[19:02.030 --> 19:03.550]  I take two bottoms off of it.
[19:03.550 --> 19:05.470]  I take two clones from those bottoms.
[19:05.470 --> 19:08.110]  Now I've got that original big plant in a three gallon pot.
[19:08.110 --> 19:09.310]  Now it's about knee high.
[19:09.310 --> 19:10.730]  I've got three clones.
[19:10.730 --> 19:13.230]  Now we have got a decision to make.
[19:13.250 --> 19:18.290]  Do we want to flower that big plant or do we want to flower the clones to find out what
[19:18.290 --> 19:19.410]  we've got?
[19:19.410 --> 19:21.890]  There are pros and cons to both.
[19:21.890 --> 19:24.410]  Flowering out that big plant, it's already veged out.
[19:24.410 --> 19:25.410]  It's already knee high.
[19:25.410 --> 19:26.410]  It's ready to go.
[19:26.410 --> 19:31.450]  You can flower that bad dog out and you can get a nice amount of flowers off of that plant
[19:31.450 --> 19:33.730]  and it's already there, ready to go.
[19:33.730 --> 19:38.050]  Or you can veg out those clones and you can get those clones up to the right size and
[19:38.050 --> 19:42.330]  you can flower those out and those clones will show you what you've got.
[19:42.430 --> 19:47.270]  If you flower out that big plant that came from the seed, you've got a really healthy,
[19:47.270 --> 19:52.150]  big, vigorous mother plant that's been cranking out lots of branches that is already ready
[19:52.150 --> 19:54.190]  to give you a bunch of clones.
[19:54.190 --> 19:59.550]  A lot of people prefer to keep that seed plant, the plant that came from the original seed
[19:59.550 --> 20:01.310]  as their mother plant.
[20:01.310 --> 20:03.930]  Many people prefer that as their keeper.
[20:03.930 --> 20:06.830]  They keep that one around and take clones from that forever.
[20:06.830 --> 20:11.590]  A lot of people will run that big plant in the flower room and finish it out because
[20:11.850 --> 20:14.670]  I said earlier, it's already got a lot of growth on it.
[20:14.670 --> 20:15.670]  It's ready to go.
[20:15.670 --> 20:16.990]  We can flower it at this point.
[20:16.990 --> 20:21.310]  Why not put that bad dog in the flower room, flip it, get some product out of it.
[20:21.310 --> 20:25.430]  Then we've got three clones over here in the cloner or in the clone dome that will become
[20:25.430 --> 20:26.430]  our keepers.
[20:26.430 --> 20:28.710]  Hopefully, one out of three of those root.
[20:28.710 --> 20:33.270]  If you're not good at cutting clones, maybe wait until you see roots on one of your clones
[20:33.270 --> 20:35.190]  before you put that big plant into flower.
[20:35.190 --> 20:36.950]  It's only going to be 14 days.
[20:36.950 --> 20:38.630]  You can wait that long, hopefully.
[20:38.630 --> 20:40.710]  So now you've got three clones aside.
[20:40.830 --> 20:42.630]  You've got a big plant in flower.
[20:42.630 --> 20:44.350]  Three of those clones are going to grow out.
[20:44.350 --> 20:47.190]  One, the best one out of that will become your new mother plant.
[20:47.190 --> 20:49.510]  The other two, you can either give them to your friends.
[20:49.510 --> 20:53.510]  You can share the genetics so the genetics don't get lost, or you can put those in your
[20:53.510 --> 20:54.510]  veg room.
[20:54.510 --> 20:56.870]  You can grow them out, make them your next flower run.
[20:56.870 --> 21:01.990]  Now you've got a mother plant and you've got two vegging for your next flower run already.
[21:01.990 --> 21:06.070]  If you need to, you can cut clones from all three of those to fill up the tray that you
[21:06.070 --> 21:11.350]  need, and then you can have a full room of that one select cultivar.
[21:11.350 --> 21:12.350]  It's all about planning.
[21:12.350 --> 21:15.270]  It's all about making the decision on which plant you need.
[21:15.270 --> 21:19.670]  Do you really prefer to keep that seed plant as your mother, or are you okay with keeping
[21:19.670 --> 21:22.190]  that best clone as your mother?
[21:22.190 --> 21:25.950]  Many people in the cannabis world were stuck on the idea of genetic drift.
[21:25.950 --> 21:30.270]  I've done a podcast episode on the way that we have been using the term genetic drift
[21:30.270 --> 21:31.750]  and what we thought it was.
[21:31.750 --> 21:32.830]  That is not accurate.
[21:32.830 --> 21:34.630]  That is not happening in cannabis.
[21:34.710 --> 21:39.990]  We don't have to worry about genetic drift if we're trying to select a mother from a
[21:39.990 --> 21:40.990]  clone.
[21:40.990 --> 21:41.990]  You don't have to worry about that.
[21:41.990 --> 21:45.950]  If your clones were properly cut, if everything was healthy, that will not be an issue.
[21:45.950 --> 21:48.670]  I would personally use my clones as my new mother.
[21:48.670 --> 21:51.810]  I would flower out that big plant since it's already grown.
[21:51.810 --> 21:56.150]  As soon as I determine if that big plant is a male or a female, if it's male and I don't
[21:56.150 --> 21:58.790]  need male plants, I would pull that male plant out of the room.
[21:58.790 --> 22:00.430]  I would get the pot out of the room.
[22:00.430 --> 22:03.310]  I would allow more space for those females to grow.
[22:03.310 --> 22:07.910]  Then I would go and remove those subsequent male clones from the tray.
[22:07.910 --> 22:10.350]  Remember, we cut three clones from each plant.
[22:10.350 --> 22:14.870]  So if you remove plant number six, you got to go find three clones that are labeled number
[22:14.870 --> 22:15.870]  six.
[22:15.870 --> 22:17.350]  All three of those need to come from the dome.
[22:17.350 --> 22:21.450]  We don't want those around unless we do intend to do some breeding.
[22:21.450 --> 22:22.950]  So that is how I would do it.
[22:22.950 --> 22:26.670]  I think that since we've already veged out that big plant, let's flower it.
[22:26.670 --> 22:30.110]  We don't need to waste all that time and space getting that plant that big and then keeping
[22:30.110 --> 22:32.890]  it as a mother when we can keep a clone as a mother.
[22:32.890 --> 22:35.770]  Then we don't even know if we have got a plant that we want.
[22:35.770 --> 22:36.850]  It could be a boy.
[22:36.850 --> 22:39.310]  It may not even be the phenotype we're looking for.
[22:39.310 --> 22:40.370]  So let's flip it.
[22:40.370 --> 22:41.850]  Let's see what we've got.
[22:41.850 --> 22:46.610]  One more little side rant or ending rant, maybe it's a tail rant to add to this.
[22:46.610 --> 22:53.490]  I'm going to say this one more time, but always take a clone from every plant you grow.
[22:53.490 --> 22:58.010]  You are going to be very heartbroken if you buy a pack of seeds, you run a pack of seeds,
[22:58.010 --> 23:03.130]  and you find a phenotype from my genetics that I have never seen before, and I am blown
[23:03.130 --> 23:05.810]  away by it, and you didn't even take a clone.
[23:05.810 --> 23:11.730]  So before you put your plants into flower, please just take one or two clones.
[23:11.730 --> 23:15.650]  If you're not really good at cloning, make sure those clones have roots before you put
[23:15.650 --> 23:21.130]  your plants into flower so you've got a genetic preserve of that plant.
[23:21.130 --> 23:25.610]  If you grow it out, and like I said before, maybe it's that one plant, that one specific
[23:25.730 --> 23:29.770]  phenotype that cures an ailment that has been bugging you for your whole life, and now you
[23:29.770 --> 23:33.850]  can just grow this one, you can roll it up, you can smoke it, and now whatever's been
[23:33.850 --> 23:35.770]  bothering you, it stops.
[23:35.770 --> 23:38.810]  You've got a full hour, maybe two hours of relief.
[23:38.810 --> 23:42.510]  Make sure you have got a clone of that because if you don't have a clone of that, all you're
[23:42.510 --> 23:45.810]  going to do is be chasing that relief forever.
[23:45.810 --> 23:48.530]  You're going to know what it felt like, you're going to remember, you're going to try to
[23:48.530 --> 23:52.690]  buy more and more packs of seeds in that, and if it's some rare magical phenotype, you
[23:52.690 --> 23:54.530]  may not ever find it again.
[23:54.530 --> 23:59.770]  We try to breed reliable, repeatable phenotypes, but this is genetics.
[23:59.770 --> 24:04.010]  You're going to find outliers, and if you find that amazing outlier, I can't promise
[24:04.010 --> 24:06.810]  you it will pop up in a pack of seeds again.
[24:06.810 --> 24:11.490]  The short version of that long ramble, which I will blame on the Malibu pyrrhic bush, is
[24:11.490 --> 24:18.370]  always take a clone of every seed you sprout before you put it into flower because you
[24:18.370 --> 24:20.770]  never know if you have got the next...
[24:20.770 --> 24:25.170]  You might have the next Girl Scout cookies or the next tangy, or you could have the next
[24:25.170 --> 24:28.170]  Gorilla Glue or whatever's popular today, the next gelato.
[24:28.170 --> 24:29.910]  You could have the next wedding cake.
[24:29.910 --> 24:33.650]  You may have the next hitter sitting right there in your grow room and you didn't take
[24:33.650 --> 24:35.130]  a clone of it.
[24:35.130 --> 24:38.510]  Now if you do fail to take clones, we can always reveg.
[24:38.510 --> 24:41.010]  I think I've done a reveg episode before.
[24:41.010 --> 24:46.370]  If not, I will put one together so we can talk about reveging keeper plants just in
[24:46.370 --> 24:48.450]  case we did not get a clone.
[24:48.930 --> 24:51.690]  All right, Scott, I think I more than answered your question.
[24:51.690 --> 24:53.290]  I want to thank you for the great email.
[24:53.290 --> 24:57.170]  Big shout out to our buddy, Scott D out there in Clayton, Washington.
[24:57.170 --> 24:58.490]  Thank you for all the support for the show.
[24:58.490 --> 25:01.930]  If you have any more questions, dude, please send me an email.
[25:01.930 --> 25:04.850]  I love helping my friends out on the podcast.
[25:04.850 --> 25:08.850]  All right, I do have one more email here in front of me for this episode.
[25:08.850 --> 25:09.930]  Let's get right into it.
[25:09.930 --> 25:12.210]  It says, hey there, Rasta Jeff.
[25:12.210 --> 25:13.210]  My name is Brendan.
[25:13.210 --> 25:16.570]  I'm a 20 year old medical patient and grower in Michigan.
[25:16.570 --> 25:17.890]  Big shout out to my new friend, Brendan.
[25:18.330 --> 25:19.330]  It's a pleasure to meet you, buddy.
[25:19.330 --> 25:22.330]  It says you can use my name if this were to make it on the podcast.
[25:22.330 --> 25:23.330]  Well, there you go.
[25:23.330 --> 25:24.610]  I said your name a couple of times.
[25:24.610 --> 25:26.410]  I'm glad I've got your permission.
[25:26.410 --> 25:30.650]  It says, I started listening to your podcast about two months ago and I really appreciate
[25:30.650 --> 25:33.330]  all of the knowledge you have given me thus far.
[25:33.330 --> 25:34.330]  Thank you, man.
[25:34.330 --> 25:35.330]  That's a great compliment.
[25:35.330 --> 25:36.330]  Thank you for listening.
[25:36.330 --> 25:37.330]  Keep it up.
[25:37.330 --> 25:38.530]  You have got a lot of catching up to do.
[25:38.530 --> 25:42.770]  It says, I can't tell you how much faster time goes by in the cubicle when listening
[25:42.770 --> 25:44.810]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[25:44.810 --> 25:47.370]  So shout out to you and White Mike for that.
[25:47.850 --> 25:48.850]  That is awesome, man.
[25:48.850 --> 25:52.810]  I love hearing that I'm helping people pass the day at a boring job.
[25:52.810 --> 25:54.090]  That means a lot to us.
[25:54.090 --> 25:58.410]  And while you're sitting there at work, you are getting paid to become a better ganja
[25:58.410 --> 25:59.410]  grower.
[25:59.410 --> 26:00.410]  So I appreciate that, man.
[26:00.410 --> 26:01.410]  Thank you.
[26:01.410 --> 26:02.410]  So the message keeps going.
[26:02.410 --> 26:06.250]  It says, I have a quick question, which I haven't heard you address in your podcast
[26:06.250 --> 26:09.330]  yet unless I have missed it.
[26:09.330 --> 26:13.290]  I am running feminized seeds from a reputable breeder.
[26:13.290 --> 26:18.130]  Sadly, they are not Irie Genetics, but I recently scored a six-pack of Lemon Jeffrey
[26:18.130 --> 26:22.130]  and Golden Goat, so I will be getting Irie in the future runs.
[26:22.130 --> 26:23.130]  All right.
[26:23.130 --> 26:27.490]  So just to be clear, this guy is growing some feminized seeds from a reputable breeder,
[26:27.490 --> 26:32.970]  which is not Irie Genetics, but he's got some Irie on deck for the future.
[26:32.970 --> 26:38.570]  Now the message goes on to say, I just went into the garden and one of my feminized plants,
[26:38.570 --> 26:44.650]  which is grown from seed, has a few branches that showed sex within a day or two and have
[26:44.650 --> 26:50.410]  pre-flowers while I have my lights on an 18-6 veg cycle.
[26:50.410 --> 26:53.650]  What are the possible causes and what should I do with this plant?
[26:53.650 --> 26:55.450]  Have you ever experienced this?
[26:55.450 --> 26:56.890]  Much love from Michigan.
[26:56.890 --> 26:58.570]  Stay Irie from Brendan.
[26:58.570 --> 27:04.690]  All right, Brendan, I think I have a couple of ideas what could be going on in your garden.
[27:04.690 --> 27:05.690]  All right.
[27:05.810 --> 27:09.570]  So Brendan has got some feminized seeds in his garden.
[27:09.570 --> 27:14.770]  They are on an 18-6 light cycle, which means they should be continuing to veg.
[27:14.770 --> 27:16.570]  They should not be flowering.
[27:16.570 --> 27:22.250]  Unfortunately, he has discovered that a couple of branches have showed sex and pre-flowers
[27:22.250 --> 27:26.250]  while these plants are still on the 18-6 light cycle.
[27:26.250 --> 27:32.810]  So he is curious what possible causes could have caused this and what to do with the plant.
[27:32.930 --> 27:36.770]  Now, I really wish I knew how long these plants had been vegging.
[27:36.770 --> 27:41.130]  I really wish I knew how much light these plants were getting and what type of light
[27:41.130 --> 27:42.210]  they were getting.
[27:42.210 --> 27:48.210]  I also really wish I knew what size container and what type of soilless mix or cocoa or
[27:48.210 --> 27:53.250]  soil you were working with and also what they have been getting fed.
[27:53.250 --> 27:58.750]  But without that information, I can give you a few ideas of what could be happening.
[27:58.750 --> 28:01.930]  The number one guess, you may have auto flowers.
[28:02.050 --> 28:08.530]  I cannot support or deny that claim in any way, but they are flowering under an 18-6
[28:08.530 --> 28:09.530]  light cycle.
[28:09.530 --> 28:12.370]  Makes me think maybe auto flowers.
[28:12.370 --> 28:16.370]  I think the only way to determine if they are actually auto flowers is to keep an eye
[28:16.370 --> 28:17.530]  on them.
[28:17.530 --> 28:21.730]  Are they actually going into full flower or is that just a little bit of a tease?
[28:21.730 --> 28:23.690]  Is it a little bit of a pre-flower?
[28:23.690 --> 28:25.610]  Are they giving you signs?
[28:25.610 --> 28:29.730]  Because earlier I said I wondered how much light they were getting.
[28:29.730 --> 28:30.890]  Are they getting enough light?
[28:30.890 --> 28:35.490]  Yes, you've got them on an 18-6 light cycle, but if you've got too many plants crowded
[28:35.490 --> 28:39.650]  in and they're not getting enough actual light on their leaves, they're not absorbing enough
[28:39.650 --> 28:44.210]  light, the amount of hours which that grow light is on in your grow room won't make a
[28:44.210 --> 28:47.730]  difference if the plants are being shaded by other plants, if they're pressed in too
[28:47.730 --> 28:51.930]  closely together, or if they're just simply too far from the light source.
[28:51.930 --> 28:55.730]  So if they think they are not getting enough light, if they're not reaching their daily
[28:55.730 --> 29:01.210]  light integral, they will begin to flower simply because they're not getting enough
[29:01.210 --> 29:06.290]  light energy and they think that the end of the world, the end of the season is coming.
[29:06.290 --> 29:12.370]  So another reason that these plants may begin to flower on you is because they may be root
[29:12.370 --> 29:13.370]  bound.
[29:13.370 --> 29:14.810]  What size pot are they in?
[29:14.810 --> 29:16.770]  How long have they been in that pot?
[29:16.770 --> 29:20.330]  If those roots are trying to grow and they don't have anywhere to go, they're all bound
[29:20.330 --> 29:24.730]  up, they're all twisted around in that pot, that plant is going to say, fuck it, I got
[29:24.730 --> 29:26.770]  nothing left to do but flower.
[29:26.770 --> 29:30.770]  I've only got a few weeks left in this pot before it's going to be terrible.
[29:30.770 --> 29:35.330]  Your plants may be stuck wearing shoes that are way too small and they may be angry about
[29:35.330 --> 29:39.450]  it and they just want bigger shoes and until you give them bigger shoes, they're going
[29:39.450 --> 29:40.890]  to flower.
[29:40.890 --> 29:44.330]  Imagine if one day when you were like seven or eight years old, I put some shoes on you,
[29:44.330 --> 29:47.930]  I laced them up real nice, I was like, those are your shoes, buddy, and now you got to
[29:47.930 --> 29:49.770]  live your whole life in those shoes.
[29:49.770 --> 29:54.090]  Now that you're a grown ass adult, those little kid shoes are going to be so super tight and
[29:54.170 --> 29:55.490]  so uncomfortable.
[29:55.490 --> 29:59.450]  That plant has lived its entire life in that container and it may be root bound, it may
[29:59.450 --> 30:04.450]  be really uncomfortable, its toes are cramped, it has no choice but to flower now just because
[30:04.450 --> 30:07.130]  that's its final survival instinct.
[30:07.130 --> 30:10.690]  It's like, this is what I know how to do, this was my entire goal in life.
[30:10.690 --> 30:17.450]  A cannabis plant's main goal is to reproduce and make more seed for the next season.
[30:17.450 --> 30:20.710]  That's its main goal and it does that by going into flower.
[30:20.710 --> 30:24.110]  The male plants get taller than the other plants so they can drop their pollen down
[30:24.110 --> 30:25.150]  on the females.
[30:25.150 --> 30:28.790]  The females get white and bushy so they can make a lot of bud sites, a lot of pistils,
[30:28.790 --> 30:32.590]  they can receive a lot of pollen, they can get pollinated, they can drop seeds for the
[30:32.590 --> 30:33.590]  future.
[30:33.590 --> 30:36.470]  A cannabis plant's main goal is to receive pollen.
[30:36.470 --> 30:39.150]  It cannot do that until it goes into flower.
[30:39.150 --> 30:43.070]  So when you stress it, you piss it off, it goes, this is what I'm going to do, I'm going
[30:43.070 --> 30:46.510]  to flower because I need to get out of this situation.
[30:46.510 --> 30:48.950]  The only way I can do that is to flower.
[30:48.950 --> 30:53.190]  Then they'll cut me down and smoke me or I get to make seeds for the next generation.
[30:53.190 --> 30:59.430]  Now there are also some nutrients and things you could spray or feed to your plants which
[30:59.430 --> 31:00.830]  may trigger them to flower.
[31:00.830 --> 31:02.350]  I've talked about some products.
[31:02.350 --> 31:05.510]  I know that Advanced Nutrients used to sell a bud igniter.
[31:05.510 --> 31:09.170]  If you accidentally fed that to your veg plants, they would be in flower next week.
[31:09.170 --> 31:10.570]  You couldn't do anything about it.
[31:10.570 --> 31:14.250]  You fed them bud igniter, they're switching, get ready, go.
[31:14.250 --> 31:18.970]  So there are products that if you accidentally feed, those will possibly potentially make
[31:18.970 --> 31:20.650]  your plants flip too early.
[31:20.650 --> 31:24.110]  If your plants are stressed, if they're not getting fed enough, if they're getting fed
[31:24.110 --> 31:29.930]  too much, if there are more than one or two stressors on a plant, it can make that plant
[31:29.930 --> 31:30.930]  pre-flower.
[31:30.930 --> 31:36.370]  I really think your plant is probably root bound or you possibly don't have enough light
[31:36.370 --> 31:41.730]  or the worst case scenario is you ended up with some accidental auto flower seeds.
[31:42.210 --> 31:44.770]  All right, Brendan, I hope I answered your question sufficiently.
[31:44.770 --> 31:46.690]  I want to thank you for the great email.
