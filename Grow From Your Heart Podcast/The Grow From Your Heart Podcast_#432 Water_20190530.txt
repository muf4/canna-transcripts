[00:00.000 --> 00:05.560]  Welcome back everybody, it is time for episode 432 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.560 --> 00:09.640]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.640 --> 00:14.040]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:14.040 --> 00:19.760]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:19.760 --> 00:23.840]  You know it's a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.840 --> 00:28.520]  Today I've been taking dabs of Miracle Alien Cookies, full spectrum extract from Green
[00:28.520 --> 00:33.560]  Dot Labs, that's right I have got the Mac, this stuff is delicious, it is alien cookies,
[00:33.560 --> 00:35.600]  cross to Colombian Starfighter.
[00:35.600 --> 00:38.640]  The label describes the flavor as jelly biscuits and lavender.
[00:38.640 --> 00:43.280]  I do taste the lavender, I don't know that I taste the jelly biscuits, that is a creative
[00:43.280 --> 00:45.540]  description, I'm gonna go right along with it.
[00:45.540 --> 00:49.760]  The label says this contains 73.88% THC.
[00:49.760 --> 00:53.880]  This may not be the most potent concentrate on my table, however it is the container that
[00:53.880 --> 00:55.040]  I keep reaching for.
[00:55.040 --> 00:59.520]  This Mac is delicious and the buzz from this Mac is perfect, I've been loving this.
[00:59.520 --> 01:04.600]  So big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious and tremendous Miracle
[01:04.600 --> 01:05.600]  Alien Cookies.
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.200]  I'm really loving this extract and I cannot get enough of it.
[01:09.200 --> 01:13.640]  Alright podcast world, in this episode I am going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:13.640 --> 01:17.840]  Before we get there, let's give a shout out to a few of our friends on Patreon.
[01:17.840 --> 01:21.600]  Let's start with a big shout out to my friend Miss Mel, also a giant Grow From Your Heart
[01:21.600 --> 01:23.760]  podcast, shout out to Kenna, you dig it?
[01:23.840 --> 01:28.080]  I wanna give a big shout out to Hogan Farms, of course a big Viking handshake to Grimbold
[01:28.080 --> 01:32.760]  the Druid, and of course a big Grow From Your Heart podcast fist bump and a shout out to
[01:32.760 --> 01:35.840]  my new friend Trap Jackson.
[01:35.840 --> 01:39.600]  Big shout out and big thanks to everybody who has supported the show in the past, in
[01:39.600 --> 01:41.480]  the present, and in the future.
[01:41.480 --> 01:48.680]  And if you would like to learn how to become a patron, you can do so by going to www.patreon.com
[01:48.680 --> 01:53.120]  slash growfromyourheart, all of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.040]  Alright podcast world, I do have one more order of business to cover before we can get
[01:58.040 --> 01:59.960]  into the listener emails.
[01:59.960 --> 02:06.320]  In the last episode, I did mention that my seeds will be available on seedsherenow.com.
[02:06.320 --> 02:11.440]  Just in case you're not familiar, I am the breeder and proprietor of iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:11.440 --> 02:14.860]  I make high THC sativa dominant hybrids.
[02:14.860 --> 02:19.360]  My brand is mostly known for my cross called Arise, it has gotten very popular lately,
[02:19.360 --> 02:21.580]  it has got very impressive lab results.
[02:21.580 --> 02:24.700]  So that is my seed company, I am iRegenetics.
[02:24.700 --> 02:29.940]  On the previous episode, I mentioned that my seeds would be available at seedsherenow.com.
[02:29.940 --> 02:34.300]  At the time of this recording, the website has not been updated to include my seeds,
[02:34.300 --> 02:36.160]  but it is in the works.
[02:36.160 --> 02:42.020]  They had a very busy holiday weekend and they are still in the process of building my brand
[02:42.020 --> 02:43.340]  onto the website.
[02:43.340 --> 02:50.540]  So please be patient, keep checking back and I will soon be available on seedsherenow.com.
[02:50.540 --> 02:54.100]  If you are eager to get some iRegenetic seeds in your garden and you don't want to wait
[02:54.100 --> 03:00.640]  for seedsherenow to get the website updated, you can go to dankseed.store or you can go
[03:00.640 --> 03:07.100]  to OregonEliteSeeds.com and they do have a great selection of iRegenetic seeds available
[03:07.100 --> 03:08.820]  at this time.
[03:08.820 --> 03:13.140]  So again, I do want to apologize for misleading you, for making you think my seeds may be
[03:13.140 --> 03:14.180]  available somewhere.
[03:14.180 --> 03:15.700]  They are not actually available.
[03:15.700 --> 03:17.560]  I apologize for the delay.
[03:17.560 --> 03:19.640]  The folks at Seeds Here Now are working on that.
[03:19.640 --> 03:23.580]  They are doing a lot of updates and upgrades to the website, so it will be very well worth
[03:23.580 --> 03:24.580]  the wait.
[03:24.580 --> 03:32.000]  So please be patient, bear with me, and in due time, my seeds will be available on seedsherenow.com.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.120]  I think that covers all of the business for the start of the show.
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.360]  Let's jump into some listener emails.
[03:37.360 --> 03:42.200]  If you'd like to send an email to the show, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:42.200 --> 03:45.600]  If you've got a cannabis culture, a cannabis cultivation question, I would love to hear
[03:45.600 --> 03:46.600]  from you.
[03:46.640 --> 03:48.360]  Let's get right into this first message.
[03:48.360 --> 03:52.120]  It says, hey Jeff, first I want to thank you for the grow lessons.
[03:52.120 --> 03:53.280]  Hey, you're very welcome.
[03:53.280 --> 03:54.280]  Thank you for listening.
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.640]  It goes on to say, I found your podcast shortly after starting my first grow late last year
[03:59.640 --> 04:02.120]  and the grow lessons helped me tremendously.
[04:02.120 --> 04:03.120]  That's what I like to hear.
[04:03.120 --> 04:04.120]  I'm glad I'm helping you out, dude.
[04:04.120 --> 04:07.200]  It goes on to say, I appreciate all of the episodes.
[04:07.200 --> 04:11.960]  Big shout out to White Mike, but your grow lessons in particular are a treasure.
[04:11.960 --> 04:17.040]  I usually listen to them two or three times to give my stoner brain a good chance to absorb
[04:17.040 --> 04:20.200]  all of the knowledge that you drop on us.
[04:20.200 --> 04:22.280]  Even the non-grow info is great.
[04:22.280 --> 04:27.080]  Anytime I have the urge to show off my grow or just a picture of my grow, I hear a little
[04:27.080 --> 04:31.320]  White Mike voice in my ear that says, just shut the fuck up.
[04:31.320 --> 04:32.640]  This guy learned a lot.
[04:32.640 --> 04:35.280]  The grow lessons were invaluable to this listener.
[04:35.280 --> 04:38.560]  Then he learned a very important lesson from myself and White Mike.
[04:38.560 --> 04:40.800]  He learned to just shut the fuck up.
[04:40.800 --> 04:44.080]  If you haven't heard that lesson, it is episode 406.
[04:44.080 --> 04:46.240]  It is titled Another Important Lesson.
[04:46.240 --> 04:49.720]  It is all about keeping your mouth shut when it comes to your cannabis grow.
[04:49.720 --> 04:51.200]  This guy has learned a lot.
[04:51.200 --> 04:52.440]  Let's continue on with the message.
[04:52.440 --> 04:55.920]  It says, I have a few questions about water.
[04:55.920 --> 05:01.880]  For reference, I've got a small indoor grow tent with three auto flower plants in soil.
[05:01.880 --> 05:05.120]  Question number one, my local water is pretty bad.
[05:05.120 --> 05:10.280]  It leaves a white residue on anything it touches and it has a strong chlorine smell.
[05:10.280 --> 05:14.800]  I'm going to assume that that white residue is calcium and we'll assume that that strong
[05:14.800 --> 05:17.240]  chlorine smell is chlorine.
[05:17.240 --> 05:23.960]  He says right out of the tap, I am reading eight to 8.4 pH and about 450 PPMs.
[05:23.960 --> 05:25.160]  This guy is doing the right thing.
[05:25.160 --> 05:27.400]  He's testing his water before he uses it.
[05:27.400 --> 05:30.360]  We are finding that the pH is quite high.
[05:30.360 --> 05:34.020]  That 450 PPMs is kind of high, but that is acceptable.
[05:34.020 --> 05:36.120]  That is kind of what you get from city water.
[05:36.120 --> 05:41.780]  What I would do is I would go to my city water website, wherever your local municipal
[05:41.780 --> 05:43.280]  water comes from.
[05:43.280 --> 05:44.360]  They have got a website.
[05:44.360 --> 05:48.000]  Whoever you are paying, whoever you send your money to, they have got a website.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.720]  Somewhere on that website, there will be a breakdown of the things they're adding to
[05:51.720 --> 05:53.120]  your municipal water.
[05:53.120 --> 05:56.840]  You'll be able to see exactly what is going into that water.
[05:56.840 --> 05:59.880]  Some of the things they use to treat water can't be filtered out.
[05:59.880 --> 06:02.640]  Some of the things they use to treat the water can't be bubbled out.
[06:02.640 --> 06:05.320]  We're going to get more into that as this message progresses.
[06:05.520 --> 06:11.080]  It says, I've recently started using an inline RV style water filter to reduce the chlorine,
[06:11.080 --> 06:15.080]  verified to be chloramine, and the PPMs.
[06:15.080 --> 06:19.560]  One of those things I mentioned that they may be treating your water with is chloramine.
[06:19.560 --> 06:22.120]  We cannot bubble chloramine out of the water.
[06:22.120 --> 06:27.120]  To effectively remove the chloramine, you need a reverse osmosis or a carbon filtration
[06:27.120 --> 06:28.360]  system.
[06:28.360 --> 06:30.920]  You will not be able to bubble out the chloramine.
[06:30.920 --> 06:37.280]  I highly doubt that your RV style water filter will be efficient enough to pull out the chloramine
[06:37.280 --> 06:38.480]  from your water supply.
[06:38.480 --> 06:39.480]  Let's continue though.
[06:39.480 --> 06:44.000]  It says, I fill my water container and I let the water come to room temperature for about
[06:44.000 --> 06:47.800]  12 hours because I was told that cold water will shock the root zone.
[06:47.800 --> 06:49.200]  Yes, that is accurate.
[06:49.200 --> 06:51.800]  If the water is too cold, it will shock the roots.
[06:51.800 --> 06:53.080]  It will send the plants into shock.
[06:53.080 --> 06:54.440]  They won't drink properly.
[06:54.440 --> 06:56.280]  They will respond accordingly.
[06:56.280 --> 07:00.240]  Imagine if I stuck your feet or your balls in really cold water.
[07:00.560 --> 07:04.120]  That is what it is like when you feed the plants really cold water, except you can lift
[07:04.120 --> 07:05.760]  your feet up out of the water.
[07:05.760 --> 07:07.200]  Those plants have no chance.
[07:07.200 --> 07:08.200]  They're stuck in it.
[07:08.200 --> 07:09.640]  They're just sitting there freezing.
[07:09.640 --> 07:11.560]  Don't feed your plants water that is too cold.
[07:11.560 --> 07:16.600]  I would say somewhere between 69 and 74 degrees is probably about the right range for your
[07:16.600 --> 07:17.600]  water.
[07:17.600 --> 07:22.100]  If you are in a recirculating system or some sort of a hydroponic system, you may want
[07:22.100 --> 07:27.000]  to go a little cooler because those warm temperatures will increase the opportunity for algae and
[07:27.000 --> 07:28.600]  funk to build up in your system.
[07:28.600 --> 07:32.880]  I'm not a hydro grower, so I'm not an expert in that region, but I know they do use a chiller
[07:32.880 --> 07:36.200]  in a hydro environment to keep that water a little bit cooler.
[07:36.200 --> 07:41.360]  If you're using a soilless mix or a cocoa or something like that, you do want that water
[07:41.360 --> 07:43.560]  to be about room temperature.
[07:43.560 --> 07:44.880]  You're doing the right thing there.
[07:44.880 --> 07:46.200]  You don't want to shock your plants.
[07:46.200 --> 07:49.120]  You're letting that water come to room temperature.
[07:49.120 --> 07:53.680]  During that time, I am also running an airstone to add more dissolved oxygen and to potentially
[07:53.680 --> 07:56.300]  bubble out any leftover chlorine.
[07:56.300 --> 07:57.800]  That will help you get rid of the chlorine.
[07:57.800 --> 08:01.360]  That will also help you get rid of some of the other elements that they use to treat
[08:01.360 --> 08:02.360]  the water.
[08:02.360 --> 08:05.160]  What you're doing there is you're creating more surface area.
[08:05.160 --> 08:07.880]  The stuff can't evaporate until it is brought to the surface.
[08:07.880 --> 08:09.320]  You're adding oxygen to it.
[08:09.320 --> 08:11.320]  You're elevating it to the surface.
[08:11.320 --> 08:13.660]  That lets it become a gas, helps it to evaporate.
[08:13.660 --> 08:16.380]  That will remove some of the things in your water.
[08:16.380 --> 08:19.160]  Like I mentioned earlier, it will not remove the chloramine.
[08:19.160 --> 08:21.400]  You will need an RO filter for that.
[08:21.400 --> 08:25.480]  Let's keep going with the email because those dabs got me rambly today.
[08:25.480 --> 08:30.440]  It says, I do this before adding any nutrients and of course, getting it all to the proper
[08:30.440 --> 08:31.440]  pH.
[08:31.440 --> 08:34.060]  Do you believe any of this to be necessary?
[08:34.060 --> 08:37.280]  If not necessary, how about beneficial?
[08:37.280 --> 08:41.620]  Is the chlorine, calcium, or whatever else is in my tap water hindering my plants in
[08:41.620 --> 08:46.920]  some way or am I taking extra steps for no real benefit?
[08:46.920 --> 08:51.600]  Now the really simple and really important answer to this question is, how are the plants
[08:51.600 --> 08:52.600]  reacting?
[08:52.600 --> 08:54.640]  Are the plants telling you that there is a problem?
[08:54.800 --> 08:56.600]  I don't know what is happening in your garden.
[08:56.600 --> 08:58.720]  I don't know what is happening in the root zone.
[08:58.720 --> 09:01.160]  I don't know what the plants are showing you.
[09:01.160 --> 09:06.120]  If the plants are showing you some type of distress, if the plants are displaying slowed
[09:06.120 --> 09:10.600]  or stagnant growth, then you possibly have a potential problem.
[09:10.600 --> 09:15.900]  If the plants look happy and they are performing at a level you expect or a level that keeps
[09:15.900 --> 09:20.120]  you happy, then there is probably not a problem.
[09:20.120 --> 09:21.960]  Now I say there's probably not a problem.
[09:21.960 --> 09:24.280]  There's always something to be improved upon.
[09:24.400 --> 09:28.600]  If the plants are performing and they're not showing any yellowing, if they're not wilting,
[09:28.600 --> 09:32.720]  if leaves aren't falling off, if there are no burnt tips, if nothing looks wrong, then
[09:32.720 --> 09:35.040]  there's probably nothing really wrong.
[09:35.040 --> 09:37.680]  The plants will let you know when they're not happy.
[09:37.680 --> 09:40.440]  Our cannabis plants love to let us know when there is a problem.
[09:40.440 --> 09:43.920]  They have very many ways to indicate that something is wrong.
[09:43.920 --> 09:45.120]  They'll turn yellow.
[09:45.120 --> 09:46.560]  They'll start giving us flags.
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.800]  The leaves will either droop and claw or the leaves will taco and fold up or the leaves
[09:50.800 --> 09:54.760]  will go pale or the leaves will start getting burnt tips or they'll get yellow stripes up
[09:54.760 --> 09:55.760]  the middle.
[09:55.760 --> 10:00.160]  These plants really give us tons of signs and very many hints as to what is going on
[10:00.160 --> 10:01.160]  with them.
[10:01.160 --> 10:05.480]  So if your plants aren't showing you that they are angry, they are probably mostly happy.
[10:05.480 --> 10:08.840]  Like I said earlier, there is always some sort of room for improvement.
[10:08.840 --> 10:12.880]  There's always something we are overlooking because we don't speak plant, but if they
[10:12.880 --> 10:16.500]  aren't showing you that they're angry, they are probably not angry.
[10:16.500 --> 10:20.200]  So the plants are the first thing, the first indicator, the main thing to look out for.
[10:20.600 --> 10:23.680]  I keep talking about all the fancy monitors and all the cool equipment that we're buying
[10:23.680 --> 10:27.880]  and using these days and we're getting further and further away from paying attention to
[10:27.880 --> 10:29.000]  the plant.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  Look at the plant.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.160]  That is the number one indicator of what's going on in your grow.
[10:33.160 --> 10:34.160]  Watch the plants.
[10:34.160 --> 10:35.720]  They will tell you if they're angry.
[10:35.720 --> 10:36.780]  They'll tell you if they're happy.
[10:36.780 --> 10:37.780]  They'll tell you if they're dry.
[10:37.780 --> 10:38.920]  They'll tell you if they're wet.
[10:38.920 --> 10:39.920]  They'll tell you what's going on.
[10:39.920 --> 10:41.160]  So pay attention to them.
[10:41.160 --> 10:44.000]  Now let's talk about the human aspect of this.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.080]  Are you wasting your time?
[10:45.080 --> 10:46.920]  Is there any benefit to this?
[10:46.920 --> 10:48.280]  You are not wasting your time.
[10:48.360 --> 10:52.240]  You are adding oxygen to the water, which is going into your plants, which is a great
[10:52.240 --> 10:53.240]  thing.
[10:53.240 --> 10:54.640]  The more oxygen in the water, the better.
[10:54.640 --> 10:55.960]  The plants will love that.
[10:55.960 --> 10:57.360]  They'll grow more vigorously.
[10:57.360 --> 11:00.080]  The root zone will be happier because of that oxygen.
[11:00.080 --> 11:01.760]  So that is not a waste of time.
[11:01.760 --> 11:06.320]  Also, you are minimizing some of the things that were put in that water.
[11:06.320 --> 11:09.920]  So some of the chlorine and other things that were put in that water for treatment will
[11:09.920 --> 11:10.920]  evaporate.
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.720]  That chloramine, however, will not be removed through your air bubble method here, but you
[11:15.720 --> 11:20.240]  are doing work because you are minimizing the overall amount of additives in that water.
[11:20.240 --> 11:22.360]  So it is not a total waste of time.
[11:22.360 --> 11:25.200]  You said you need to let the water sit to come to room temperature anyway.
[11:25.200 --> 11:28.500]  So while it's sitting to get to room temperature, why not bubble it up a little bit?
[11:28.500 --> 11:30.020]  That's going to add oxygen.
[11:30.020 --> 11:33.320]  That is going to remove some of those chemicals that were put in there.
[11:33.320 --> 11:35.480]  Also, it shows that you care about the plants.
[11:35.480 --> 11:38.920]  You're just doing something extra for the plants to make sure that they're happy.
[11:38.920 --> 11:40.100]  And that is always good for you.
[11:40.100 --> 11:41.820]  That is kind of a good exercise.
[11:41.820 --> 11:44.000]  It's giving you a bond with that plant.
[11:44.000 --> 11:45.580]  It's sort of like play and fetch with the plant.
[11:45.640 --> 11:48.980]  You can't really throw a ball for the plant to go get, but you can give it some extra
[11:48.980 --> 11:51.500]  love by treating its water extra special.
[11:51.500 --> 11:53.100]  So you're showing some love for the plant.
[11:53.100 --> 11:56.100]  You're showing that you're dedicated to the garden and that you want the best for that plant.
[11:57.100 --> 11:58.100]  It may be one extra detail.
[11:58.100 --> 12:01.400]  It may be one extra step, but you're going to notice it in the final product.
[12:01.400 --> 12:05.200]  You're going to be proud of what you did, and it may be because of this extra step.
[12:05.200 --> 12:08.540]  So do it if it is not adding extra time to your regimen.
[12:08.540 --> 12:12.260]  If it's slowing you down and it's not necessary, that is when you need to start thinking about
[12:12.260 --> 12:13.620]  removing steps.
[12:13.660 --> 12:16.340]  This does not seem like a waste of time at this point.
[12:16.340 --> 12:19.740]  If you were running a larger grow and you had more plants, I would recommend moving
[12:19.740 --> 12:24.360]  to a larger filter, possibly a reverse osmosis filtering system to clean all of that stuff
[12:24.360 --> 12:25.660]  out of your water.
[12:25.660 --> 12:29.840]  Since you're in such a small grow, I may upgrade to what is called a big boy filter.
[12:29.840 --> 12:31.900]  But the bottom line is, are your plants happy?
[12:31.900 --> 12:36.040]  If the plants look happy with what you're doing, don't change anything.
[12:36.040 --> 12:37.060]  Filtration will cost you money.
[12:37.060 --> 12:39.740]  I don't know if you're growing for medical purposes for yourself.
[12:39.740 --> 12:42.740]  I don't know if you're making any income off of your product.
[12:42.740 --> 12:46.140]  If you aren't making any income off of the product, it is hard to put money into the
[12:46.140 --> 12:47.260]  product.
[12:47.260 --> 12:51.220]  So I understand that buying an expensive filter may not be an option right now, especially
[12:51.220 --> 12:53.700]  when throwing a bubbler in there seems to be working.
[12:53.700 --> 12:56.820]  So as long as those plants are happy, keep doing what you're doing.
[12:56.820 --> 13:01.020]  Also, I would recommend checking that water about once a month.
[13:01.020 --> 13:05.180]  Around the first of the month, throw your EC meter or your PPM meter in that water,
[13:05.180 --> 13:08.780]  throw your pH pen in that water, and just document if it has changed.
[13:08.780 --> 13:10.380]  Has the pH gone up or down?
[13:10.380 --> 13:12.060]  Has the PPMs gone up or down?
[13:12.060 --> 13:15.400]  And if you see a drastic change, maybe go to that website and look and see what they've
[13:15.400 --> 13:18.980]  done differently because you will see it change seasonally.
[13:18.980 --> 13:21.980]  More people do outdoor watery things in the summer.
[13:21.980 --> 13:27.500]  We use less water in the winter, so the water is treated differently per season, per area.
[13:27.500 --> 13:29.540]  So make sure you check on that occasionally.
[13:29.540 --> 13:33.460]  And if you are one of those people who knows that when you mix up your nutrients, that
[13:33.460 --> 13:37.700]  solution has come to this point, and now I need to add about four drops of pH down and
[13:37.700 --> 13:42.000]  I'm right where I need to be, your water that you started with may have changed.
[13:42.940 --> 13:47.320]  It may be time for you just to check, just for peace of mind, just put your PPM meter
[13:47.320 --> 13:51.160]  in there, put your pH meter in there, and actually see if it is what you thought it
[13:51.160 --> 13:56.320]  was because over time, like I said, your local water supply will change the chemicals which
[13:56.320 --> 13:58.480]  they use to treat your municipal water.
[13:58.480 --> 14:02.540]  So you may have gotten accustomed to putting four drops of pH down in there.
[14:02.540 --> 14:04.140]  You may be way off.
[14:04.140 --> 14:07.040]  You may not be anywhere near where you think you are.
[14:07.040 --> 14:10.040]  You think you've got your pH dialed in right where you want it and your plants are not
[14:10.040 --> 14:11.440]  feeding properly.
[14:11.440 --> 14:13.320]  You'll start seeing plant problems.
[14:13.320 --> 14:16.240]  You'll try to correct those problems by adding cow mag.
[14:16.240 --> 14:19.720]  You'll try to correct that problem by adding something else or taking something else out
[14:19.720 --> 14:24.360]  when the whole problem was that your pH was off because you were not checking your pH
[14:24.360 --> 14:26.960]  because you thought it was a certain thing.
[14:26.960 --> 14:28.380]  So make sure you check.
[14:28.380 --> 14:32.120]  It only takes a couple of seconds to stick a pH pin in a solution and wait for it to
[14:32.120 --> 14:34.080]  come to 6.2 and show you what it is.
[14:34.080 --> 14:36.720]  The little check mark pops up, 6.2, I'm good.
[14:36.720 --> 14:38.080]  Let's go water some plants.
[14:38.080 --> 14:39.440]  It only takes a couple of seconds.
[14:39.440 --> 14:44.480]  And if it's off, it only takes a couple of more seconds to add some pH up or pH down.
[14:44.480 --> 14:48.080]  Drop it in there, swirl it around, give the water a couple of seconds to stir up and stick
[14:48.080 --> 14:49.560]  your meter back in there.
[14:49.560 --> 14:51.940]  If it's wrong, keep adjusting.
[14:51.940 --> 14:55.720]  When you're adjusting your pH, I suggest you go very slowly.
[14:55.720 --> 14:58.080]  There is a funny joke in the grow world.
[14:58.080 --> 15:02.800]  The pH up or down solution doesn't work until you have used too much.
[15:02.800 --> 15:04.280]  So go very slowly.
[15:04.280 --> 15:06.480]  You'll put in one drop, you won't see a change.
[15:06.480 --> 15:08.840]  You'll put in two drops, you won't see a change.
[15:08.840 --> 15:11.600]  You put in three drops, it will change drastically.
[15:11.600 --> 15:17.640]  So go really slowly when adjusting your pH if you're using a liquid pH up or down solution,
[15:17.640 --> 15:20.080]  especially in a larger container of water.
[15:20.080 --> 15:22.720]  It will take a minute for all of that stuff to move around.
[15:22.720 --> 15:26.600]  So make sure it all stirs in so that your pH adjustment solution isn't just in one big
[15:26.600 --> 15:28.040]  puddle in that water.
[15:28.040 --> 15:30.240]  Make sure it all gets saturated into that.
[15:30.240 --> 15:31.240]  What's the word I'm looking for?
[15:31.240 --> 15:33.140]  Emulsified, I think is the word I want.
[15:33.140 --> 15:36.520]  Make sure it's all emulsified and all stirred up real well so that you don't have just one
[15:36.680 --> 15:40.520]  big pocket of pH solution here where the pH is really awkward in one spot and the rest
[15:40.520 --> 15:42.800]  of the water is a totally different pH.
[15:42.800 --> 15:47.200]  Make sure you get it stirred up if you've got a large vat of water is what I'm saying.
[15:47.200 --> 15:50.520]  Now one thing I want to touch on while I'm talking about mixing up water and adjusting
[15:50.520 --> 15:58.520]  pH is if you are using a liquid pH adjusting solution like a pH up or pH down and you use
[15:58.520 --> 16:04.640]  too much and you have gone past your desired pH range, I do not suggest using the opposite
[16:04.640 --> 16:07.560]  product to correct your adjustment.
[16:07.560 --> 16:12.680]  So let's say you were trying to get to 6.2 and you added too much pH down and you are
[16:12.680 --> 16:14.520]  now at 5.9.
[16:14.520 --> 16:18.800]  I would not add pH up to correct that.
[16:18.800 --> 16:25.680]  The pH up and pH down products are not meant to be combined and the chemical reaction could
[16:25.680 --> 16:31.760]  wreak havoc on your nutrient solution depending on what was used to create those products.
[16:31.760 --> 16:33.200]  I don't know what brands you're buying.
[16:33.200 --> 16:38.400]  I don't know what you're using, but there is a potential to destroy your nutrient mix
[16:38.400 --> 16:42.040]  by adding both of those products at the same time.
[16:42.040 --> 16:48.640]  So if you do use too much of a pH up or down liquid adjustment solution, I do not recommend
[16:48.640 --> 16:52.120]  using the opposite product to correct the mistake.
[16:52.120 --> 16:56.480]  There are a couple of things you can do to correct the pH once you've added too much
[16:56.480 --> 16:58.720]  of a pH adjustment product.
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.160]  You can add more water.
[17:01.160 --> 17:05.960]  If the pH has gone too low and the natural pH of the water coming in from the tap is
[17:05.960 --> 17:11.860]  higher, you can just add higher pH water and it will slowly raise the pH of your solution.
[17:11.860 --> 17:17.840]  Now adding water to your already mixed solution is going to reduce the overall PPMs depending
[17:17.840 --> 17:19.520]  on how much water you need to add.
[17:19.520 --> 17:22.480]  That may or may not make a big difference to your feed.
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.040]  That just depends on how far you have gone off of your desired range and also how big
[17:27.040 --> 17:29.720]  your starting amount of water is.
[17:29.720 --> 17:33.520]  In a small home grow, you may be able to just dump your water and start over if you're working
[17:33.520 --> 17:35.200]  with a gallon or two.
[17:35.200 --> 17:40.040]  Imagine working in a commercial environment where my reservoirs range from 100 to 500
[17:40.040 --> 17:41.040]  gallons.
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.020]  Imagine if I messed up 500 gallons of water and had to dump that out.
[17:45.020 --> 17:46.320]  That is expensive.
[17:46.320 --> 17:48.560]  That is heartbreaking to waste that much water.
[17:48.560 --> 17:50.720]  I could have fed the grow one time with that.
[17:50.720 --> 17:55.580]  Imagine a village could survive off of 500 gallons of water for a long time depending
[17:55.580 --> 17:57.000]  on the amount of people there.
[17:57.000 --> 17:59.240]  So I don't want to waste 500 gallons of water.
[17:59.240 --> 18:03.480]  So if I adjust the pH and it's too low, I'm probably going to add water and then we're
[18:03.480 --> 18:08.840]  just going to feed and we're going to have a little bit reduced PPMs for that one feeding.
[18:08.840 --> 18:12.720]  Again in a commercial environment, I'm feeding at least once, maybe twice, sometimes three
[18:12.720 --> 18:13.800]  times a day.
[18:13.800 --> 18:18.320]  So that one reduced feeding is not going to have a big effect in the overall scheme of
[18:18.320 --> 18:19.400]  the grow.
[18:19.400 --> 18:22.720]  So if you've got a small batch, a small amount of water and you're comfortable with dumping
[18:22.720 --> 18:25.560]  it and starting over, that is something you can do.
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.840]  Another thing we can do to adjust the pH of our solution without adding another pH
[18:29.840 --> 18:33.280]  up or down product is to add a nutrient.
[18:33.280 --> 18:38.140]  If you've gotten your pH too high, something like a kelp product or a humic product will
[18:38.140 --> 18:41.880]  definitely help lower the pH of your solution.
[18:41.880 --> 18:46.320]  And one more very important thing to talk about while we're discussing pH is the temperature
[18:46.320 --> 18:49.880]  of your solution will affect your pH drastically.
[18:49.880 --> 18:53.580]  If the water is too cold, your pH will not register correctly.
[18:53.580 --> 18:56.940]  If the water is too warm, the pH will not register correctly.
[18:56.940 --> 19:03.740]  So again, let that water get to room temperature before you measure and adjust the pH of your
[19:03.740 --> 19:04.740]  nutrient solution.
[19:04.740 --> 19:09.640]  All right, you guys, I did a full episode called The Importance of Proper pH.
[19:09.640 --> 19:14.820]  If you want to learn a lot about pH, about how pH is measured and why pH matters, I highly
[19:14.820 --> 19:19.140]  suggest you check out episode 347 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[19:19.140 --> 19:23.500]  That episode will give you a lot of information and a lot of education on the importance of
[19:23.620 --> 19:24.620]  your proper pH.
[19:24.620 --> 19:30.140]  All right, there is a part two of this question and it goes like this.
[19:30.140 --> 19:33.500]  Does flushing with distilled water have any benefits?
[19:33.500 --> 19:37.560]  We're not supposed to drink distilled water regularly because it flushes minerals from
[19:37.560 --> 19:38.560]  your body.
[19:38.560 --> 19:41.420]  So would it do the same to your soil?
[19:41.420 --> 19:45.460]  They wrap up the message by saying, thanks again for all the info you provide and for
[19:45.460 --> 19:47.260]  supporting the community like you do.
[19:47.260 --> 19:48.940]  Hey, you're very, very welcome.
[19:48.940 --> 19:50.340]  Thank you for the great question.
[19:50.340 --> 19:55.300]  They wrap it up with your friend in prohibition land who cannot wait to wear his glitter suspenders.
[19:55.300 --> 19:56.620]  Wow, that's pretty awesome.
[19:56.620 --> 19:58.060]  Then they sign their name.
[19:58.060 --> 19:59.140]  Thank you for the great message.
[19:59.140 --> 20:01.140]  Let's answer part two.
[20:01.140 --> 20:06.420]  I don't find it necessary or beneficial to flush our plants with distilled water.
[20:06.420 --> 20:11.340]  The main point of flushing at this point is to rinse out the medium.
[20:11.340 --> 20:15.500]  If you're using a soilless mix, if you're using cocoa, if you're using whatever you're
[20:15.660 --> 20:21.260]  Whatever that soil root mass is living inside of, we want to rinse that out so there aren't
[20:21.260 --> 20:22.380]  leftover nutrients.
[20:22.380 --> 20:25.020]  We've been feeding the plants nutrients for several weeks.
[20:25.020 --> 20:26.580]  There's a bunch of stuff in there.
[20:26.580 --> 20:28.300]  We kind of want to rinse out that root ball.
[20:28.300 --> 20:32.780]  We kind of want to rinse out the dirt so that the plant will begin to starve and cannibalize
[20:32.780 --> 20:35.260]  itself, is essentially what we want to do.
[20:35.260 --> 20:40.940]  What we're trying to rinse out are 16 essential minerals that the plant live off of.
[20:40.940 --> 20:44.420]  I'm not going to list all 16 because I want your brain to do a little bit of thinking
[20:44.460 --> 20:48.940]  and maybe you'll do a little bit of research, but we'll start with calcium, magnesium, phosphorus,
[20:48.940 --> 20:50.500]  potassium, nitrogen.
[20:50.500 --> 20:51.940]  Those are five to think about right there.
[20:51.940 --> 20:56.020]  Those are five things we're feeding our plants, five things we've put in the soil, five things
[20:56.020 --> 20:57.460]  that we kind of want to rinse out.
[20:57.460 --> 20:59.660]  Those are not in regular water.
[20:59.660 --> 21:03.700]  So feeding water to the plants at the end, you're not adding anything.
[21:03.700 --> 21:08.620]  So using distilled water would not have any advantage or any benefit since there isn't
[21:08.620 --> 21:12.740]  nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, molybdenum.
[21:12.860 --> 21:16.460]  Now there will be calcium in there because we talked about that calcium that was visible
[21:16.460 --> 21:20.780]  earlier, but there won't be enough to make a difference in the final outcome and the
[21:20.780 --> 21:22.460]  final product.
[21:22.460 --> 21:26.380]  So you are correct in thinking that humans should not drink too much distilled water
[21:26.380 --> 21:30.660]  because it will flush the minerals from our body, but I don't find it necessary for flushing
[21:30.660 --> 21:31.660]  our cannabis plants.
[21:31.660 --> 21:35.580]  Our main goal there is to rinse out the medium, then the plants do the rest of what we call
[21:35.580 --> 21:39.380]  the flushing process through their metabolism, through their exudates.
[21:39.380 --> 21:42.540]  We are going to talk a lot more about flushing our plants in the very near future.
[21:43.340 --> 21:44.340]  I've been doing a lot of research.
[21:44.340 --> 21:45.420]  I've been doing a lot of reading.
[21:45.420 --> 21:49.180]  I have read some informative yet controversial things on the topic of flushing.
[21:49.180 --> 21:53.020]  I have also said some controversial things when it comes to flushing.
[21:53.020 --> 21:54.300]  I'm going to do more research.
[21:54.300 --> 21:58.060]  I'm going to do more reading and I'm going to get a solid understanding of what I'm trying
[21:58.060 --> 22:01.460]  to say before I bring it to a public forum.
[22:01.460 --> 22:05.620]  So at this time, I don't find any reason to flush our plants with distilled water.
[22:05.620 --> 22:10.100]  I think it would become expensive and probably a bit of a pain in the ass to haul around
[22:10.100 --> 22:12.780]  enough water to effectively flush your garden.
[22:12.780 --> 22:18.300]  And if you live in a non-legal state, that is another indicator and another sign that
[22:18.300 --> 22:21.100]  you may be doing something out of the normal.
[22:21.100 --> 22:24.460]  Something else that is popping up in the back of my head while I'm talking about this, I
[22:24.460 --> 22:28.660]  use RO water in many grow environments.
[22:28.660 --> 22:33.920]  Reverse osmosis water in many ways is very similar to distilled water, in many ways is
[22:33.920 --> 22:36.180]  also different than distilled water.
[22:36.460 --> 22:41.780]  I don't see much of a difference in the flush when I use the RO water compared to when I
[22:41.780 --> 22:46.340]  use just regular tap water or just water ran through the big boy filter.
[22:46.340 --> 22:48.540]  I won't notice any difference.
[22:48.540 --> 22:51.500]  All right, podcast world, I think that wraps up this question.
[22:51.500 --> 22:54.780]  I want to thank our friend once again for sending this message from Prohibition Land.
[22:54.780 --> 22:59.020]  Bro, I cannot wait until you get to wear your glitter suspenders.
[22:59.020 --> 23:03.180]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis cultivation or a cannabis culture question, I would love
[23:03.180 --> 23:04.180]  to hear from you.
[23:04.180 --> 23:08.740]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[23:08.740 --> 23:12.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, that is all I've got for you for this quick Thursday episode of
