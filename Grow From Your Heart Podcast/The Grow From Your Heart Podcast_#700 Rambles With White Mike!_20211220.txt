[00:00.060 --> 00:22.140]  Here we go. Welcome to the show podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:22.140 --> 00:27.780]  This is episode number 700 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. In this episode, I am
[00:27.780 --> 00:32.220]  joined by my buddy, White Mike. Of course, we've been dabbing pre-show a little bit,
[00:32.220 --> 00:36.340]  so words are harder than they should be today. I will introduce White Mike in just a moment
[00:36.340 --> 00:40.300]  before we get to that part of the show. Let's do some shout outs to a few of those great
[00:40.300 --> 00:45.420]  folks who have continued to support the show on Patreon. Let's kick it off with the big

[01:42.960 --> 01:47.720]  notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends. I made
[01:47.720 --> 01:51.680]  it through the intro. Let's get to the part of the show where we intro my buddy, White
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.840]  Mike. White Mike, welcome to the show, brother. Thanks, man. Thanks for having me. What's
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.360]  up, everybody? Welcome to the show, bro. This is a good opportunity while I catch my breath
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.560]  from spitting out that intro so loud and fast. Would you like to tell everybody how they
[02:05.560 --> 02:11.000]  can stalk you on social media? Plug any stuff you'd like to plug right now. If you're looking
[02:11.000 --> 02:17.000]  to find me on social media, you can follow me on Twitter at Nemo Punk 15, or you can
[02:17.000 --> 02:22.920]  find me on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws. Nemo Punk 15, you guys. Nemo
[02:22.920 --> 02:28.400]  Punk 15 and Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws. Mike, I think I've asked you a long time ago,
[02:28.400 --> 02:31.520]  and if this is inappropriate for the show, we can't edit it out. Where did Nemo Punk
[02:31.520 --> 02:34.440]  15 come from? What the hell does that mean, bro?
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.120]  So the 15 is the age when I came up with the handle.
[02:38.120 --> 02:39.120]  Wow.
[02:39.120 --> 02:45.280]  I was creating my first Hotmail account. That's how old that is. So I don't necessarily want
[02:45.280 --> 02:49.800]  to say the number of years that account has been around, but that was my first Hotmail
[02:49.800 --> 02:55.600]  account way back in the day, and it has just survived. And when I first created a Twitter
[02:55.600 --> 03:02.440]  handle, I did it as a joke so that I could hassle Huffington Post live personality on
[03:02.440 --> 03:08.680]  Twitter. And I never thought it would go anywhere. And then here we are, I don't know, a decade
[03:08.680 --> 03:09.680]  later.
[03:09.680 --> 03:10.680]  All right. That's the story.
[03:10.680 --> 03:12.680]  That's where Nemo Punk 15 comes from.
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.000]  But that's the 15. What's Nemo Punk?
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.880]  Just Nemo is known for Latin, and that movie wasn't out yet. And I was a little punk.
[03:22.880 --> 03:23.880]  I know you still are.
[03:23.880 --> 03:24.880]  It's complicated.
[03:25.160 --> 03:29.160]  You're a good dude now. You're an adult now. But if we would have known each other in our
[03:29.160 --> 03:34.560]  teens, we would have gotten in a lot more trouble than we did without being friends
[03:34.560 --> 03:39.160]  with each other. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad we met in our adult lives once we got that shit out
[03:39.160 --> 03:42.880]  of our system. All right. That's Nemo Punk 15. Go ahead, dude. I don't mean to interrupt
[03:42.880 --> 03:43.880]  you. I talk a lot.
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.440]  That's where it comes from. It's just one of those things that stuck around. And every
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.520]  now and then I'm like, I should retire that. But it's attached to everything at this point.
[03:53.840 --> 03:59.040]  Yeah. What do you do? My email address is my email is I read genetics at Hotmail.com.
[03:59.040 --> 04:02.640]  I just came up with that one day I needed an email address. I hit Hotmail and I was
[04:02.640 --> 04:05.840]  like, oh, and now when I tell people, they're like, really, bro, you're going to are you
[04:05.840 --> 04:10.840]  going to ever going to upgrade? I got a hotmail like it's not exactly an AOL address, but
[04:10.840 --> 04:15.520]  it's close. I do check an AOL address occasionally.
[04:16.120 --> 04:20.560]  Anyway, my niece has ridiculed me extensively for having a Hotmail account.
[04:20.720 --> 04:24.240]  We're telling people how old we are, bro. You didn't want to reveal how many years ago
[04:24.240 --> 04:28.400]  you made that email account. But we're telling people a lot of time we're hitting at them.
[04:28.400 --> 04:32.000]  Yeah. Mike, Mike, where's Jenko's still? You guys. All right. Now, Pueblo for sensible
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.040]  cannabis laws is another good place to go support Mike. That is a great place. Mike
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.440]  Post, great stuff there. Good, friendly cannabis debates, a lot of good cannabis info. So check
[04:40.440 --> 04:45.360]  him out at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws. Dude, you haven't been on on a long time.
[04:45.360 --> 04:49.440]  The people have been asking for you. It is good to see you. Would you like to plug your
[04:49.440 --> 04:54.560]  Patreon page while I'm thinking about it? Sure. It's a Patreon dot com forward slash
[04:54.560 --> 05:00.760]  white Mike. Find me a probably a link in the show notes. Make it easy for the people.
[05:01.040 --> 05:04.440]  There you go. As I'm editing and I hear that, I'll go type that in the notes that I create.
[05:04.440 --> 05:08.200]  I'll put that in the notes. Shout out to some of my supporters real quick. She gave me a
[05:08.200 --> 05:15.280]  chance to plug it easy. Tree Star Meadow. A big thank you. Farmer Z. Always appreciated.
[05:15.480 --> 05:21.000]  Locomotive Medical. Love you guys. Lemur Priest. Thank you so much for the support and grow
[05:21.000 --> 05:25.400]  from your heart podcast. Really appreciate the support, brother. Yeah, dude, I got to
[05:25.400 --> 05:29.040]  I got to pay it forward. Shit rolls downhill. Something like that. You're welcome, bro.
[05:29.040 --> 05:34.040]  Thank you for coming on the show, taking time. You Mike might not be on the show as many
[05:34.040 --> 05:37.320]  episodes as we would like him, but he does contribute. Sometimes I'll just message Mike
[05:37.320 --> 05:40.240]  a couple of things like, hey, bro, what's the answer to this? And it'll just trigger
[05:40.240 --> 05:43.560]  my brain. And so there you go. Patreon funding. I feel like it's the right thing to do.
[05:43.560 --> 05:47.720]  I'm doing behind the scenes action, but I've been missing being on the podcast. I've been
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.800]  dragging my feet, getting the new office space set up and getting all the podcast equipment
[05:52.800 --> 05:57.640]  reassembled in episode 700 was the motivation I needed to get her done.
[05:57.640 --> 06:00.840]  I like that. Yeah. Mike was like 700 is coming up, dude. What are we doing? I was like, we're
[06:00.840 --> 06:04.240]  going to zoom chat. What do you think we're going to do? I like the new background. It's
[06:04.240 --> 06:07.880]  nice. And I like the dark set up there. It's just dark enough to where you're not a floating
[06:07.880 --> 06:12.120]  head, but you are still mysterious. I have no idea what's happening three feet behind
[06:12.120 --> 06:19.960]  you. Yeah. One of the, one of the kids needed my other light source. So I am shy one light
[06:19.960 --> 06:25.600]  source right now, but everything else is up and running and still functional after like
[06:25.600 --> 06:28.680]  so much stuff has happened since the last time I was in the podcast, there was major
[06:28.680 --> 06:32.800]  construction in this space. We had to tear concrete out with a jack hammer and install
[06:32.800 --> 06:38.080]  palms. When you say there was a flood, everybody just goes, Oh, like anybody that's had a basement
[06:38.080 --> 06:41.960]  flood, they go, Oh, they feel empathetic or sympathetic or they get feelings and they
[06:41.960 --> 06:46.560]  understand like, yeah, I know what you mean, brother. So yeah, we, we understand that flood
[06:46.560 --> 06:52.080]  set you back quite a bit. There's nothing like fighting four inches of water come pouring
[06:52.080 --> 06:58.280]  out of your concrete floor. That was a fun night. You said something about equipment
[06:58.280 --> 07:03.360]  and I do want to reassure the people that this is the a rare zoom type video for me.
[07:03.360 --> 07:08.040]  I do have the multi-cam four camera, a 4k camera. There were words in there that were
[07:08.040 --> 07:15.360]  meant to make sense. Multi camera, 4k camera setup. That was really hard to say. Yeah.
[07:15.360 --> 07:18.480]  Usually I have that going. This is a rare zoom occasion. I'm using the, the Mac book
[07:18.480 --> 07:23.560]  camera here. It looks pretty good in my opinion. But the other night camera too, I recorded
[07:23.560 --> 07:28.200]  a full show on it and camera two did not record. So I'm having both of those cameras. They're,
[07:28.200 --> 07:30.920]  they're in timeout right now. And then once they get fixed, we'll be able to do the episodes
[07:30.920 --> 07:35.480]  on those. And maybe just maybe there may be time funding for an upgrade here because
[07:35.480 --> 07:39.200]  the Patreon folks have been helping us out so much for so long that it may be time to
[07:39.200 --> 07:43.960]  add another camera, a better camera. So I do assure you, I do promise this zoom thing.
[07:43.960 --> 07:49.120]  This one camera thing is not going to be forever. I know I've set expectations and I will deliver
[07:49.120 --> 07:54.120]  those. Yeah. Speaking of that, that's a good way to segue into this. A big shout out. Thank
[07:54.120 --> 07:58.280]  you to the Patreon crew. Dude, how about the evolution of this podcast? That's a great
[07:58.280 --> 08:00.280]  segue. My next note is evolution of the show.
[08:00.280 --> 08:05.240]  The evolution of the show. I was going to say we, while you were talking about getting
[08:05.240 --> 08:09.520]  the new cameras, I was going to say I was just over in the new recording space and it
[08:09.520 --> 08:15.760]  is looking amazing. Well, thank you. Yeah. Sitting here at episode 700, we've come a
[08:15.760 --> 08:19.840]  long way from that old coffee table.
[08:19.840 --> 08:22.640]  When you put your arms down, you'd almost feel like you got letters imprinted on it
[08:22.640 --> 08:27.000]  because people had written so many things that had just like hieroglyphics, like melted
[08:27.000 --> 08:32.280]  into it. Yeah. There was a lot of dabs stuck to it. Top of it. Yeah. There was a lot of
[08:32.280 --> 08:38.680]  burn marks on that table. That table got a lot of use. The dabs stuck to the top of that
[08:38.680 --> 08:43.360]  table were felony weight in some states. Yes. You could probably scrape up enough, enough
[08:43.360 --> 08:48.240]  residual concentrates off that table to take a couple of fat dabs. The table did go through
[08:48.240 --> 08:52.640]  hell. A big shout out to oil slick. One time I was on a live show on an Instagram live
[08:52.640 --> 08:57.160]  and oil slick came on and they're like, why don't you have a big excuse that that's from
[08:57.160 --> 09:00.600]  the dabs before the show. They're like, why don't you have a big oil slick pad for that
[09:00.600 --> 09:05.000]  table? And I said, cause you didn't send it yet. And he said, give me your a PO box and
[09:05.000 --> 09:08.880]  check that shit in a couple of days. And seriously, five days later, there's a big table sized
[09:08.880 --> 09:14.280]  oil slick pad in there. So that was pretty awesome. Cover the entire table is perfect.
[09:14.280 --> 09:17.640]  So couldn't get, I just clean it real easy. Wipe it down with a little alcohol. It didn't
[09:17.640 --> 09:23.320]  mess anything up. It was great. But yeah. So we went from a crappy recording. I used
[09:23.320 --> 09:24.320]  my old.
[09:24.320 --> 09:29.000]  That first episode with you and Kevin is hilarious. I listened to it like at least once a year
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.180]  just to remind myself where the show started.
[09:32.180 --> 09:35.160]  When people tell me that they're a new listener and they've gone back and they're like, I've
[09:35.160 --> 09:39.140]  listened to the whole catalog. I'm like, oh man. I'm like, thank you for the clicks and
[09:39.140 --> 09:43.720]  thank you for liking the show. But also dude, don't judge me. Like I'm so much better at
[09:43.720 --> 09:49.000]  this by now. I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure what we were doing yet. I didn't know that
[09:49.000 --> 09:53.720]  what the goal was. I wanted to have more of a hangout smoke party vibe, but also I like
[09:53.720 --> 09:57.280]  teaching. So I kind of narrowed it down to me, just giving you a good lesson.
[09:57.280 --> 10:02.400]  I feel like it's more, more what I was trying to do, but I started using the old, that equipment
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.000]  I used came from when I was a drummer on the road. I had an independent mixer for the drums.
[10:07.000 --> 10:10.920]  I used to have a big mixing board, all kinds of shit. I had compression because Wade was
[10:10.920 --> 10:14.000]  blowing out the mic on the old show we were on. I had compression.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.760]  A giant rack of equipment.
[10:16.760 --> 10:24.480]  Yeah. And now, well then we upgraded to the Zoom H6, which was fun. I could get four mics
[10:24.480 --> 10:30.200]  on there. Man, I remember times we had like nine people on the show. The whole table was
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.000]  full and then the little side table over there had people at it. That was a good time. Now
[10:34.000 --> 10:36.920]  I've got room for four mics on one device. I'm just using the...
[10:36.920 --> 10:38.680]  Who took the dry dab that day?
[10:39.080 --> 10:43.600]  The dry dab that day was Sloppy. Big shout out to our buddy, Shampoo Sloppy. Shampoo,
[10:43.600 --> 10:47.960]  I called him shampoo, but a Shampoo Sloppy. Yeah, it was Sloppy. What were the numbers
[10:47.960 --> 10:52.280]  in his name? Nine, Sloppy. I don't remember the numbers. Sloppy always has numbers in
[10:52.280 --> 10:57.920]  his name, but big up to Slop Dizzle. He took a big fat dry dab in a podcast. Might've been
[10:57.920 --> 11:04.720]  episode 200 or 500. I don't recall. Of course, the brain injury makes things wonky, but I
[11:04.720 --> 11:09.240]  had a bunch of people over. Garden of Weed and Crew was over. Spence, Maddy, Joe Buzzy
[11:09.240 --> 11:14.380]  was here. Sloppy was here. Sloppy sat down and took a fat dab out of a rig with no water
[11:14.380 --> 11:16.720]  in it. That was an experience.
[11:16.720 --> 11:19.360]  The email had slow baked all the water out of the rig.
[11:19.360 --> 11:20.360]  Yeah, it evaporated everything.
[11:20.360 --> 11:25.440]  It wasn't even a cold glass rig. The glass was warm enough to slowly bake water out of
[11:25.440 --> 11:26.440]  itself.
[11:26.440 --> 11:28.440]  Yummy dabs. Man.
[11:28.440 --> 11:30.440]  Best time.
[11:30.440 --> 11:37.760]  Yeah. We went from all that wonky recording equipment to the Zoom H6 to now I'm using
[11:37.760 --> 11:43.600]  a Zoom PodTrack 4. During the pandemic, I got inspired to, I don't remember what number,
[11:43.600 --> 11:47.960]  around 560, I think I started doing videos. I was using the MacBook and just using the
[11:47.960 --> 11:54.200]  screen on the Mac. That was fun, but it didn't seem as good as it could be. I knew I could
[11:54.200 --> 11:57.680]  do better. Having this weird frame of view was different.
[11:57.680 --> 12:03.640]  I bought a camera, a real camera. Then I set up a 4K camera. I learned how to do that.
[12:03.640 --> 12:07.400]  I learned how to edit in Final Cut Pro. I bought a camera, which resulted in buying
[12:07.400 --> 12:11.840]  a new computer because the camera, I dumped that file into the computer and the computer
[12:11.840 --> 12:16.160]  went, that's funny. I had to go buy a brand new computer that could handle the editing
[12:16.160 --> 12:19.600]  and processing I was trying to do. I was like, well, if I'm going to spend the money on that,
[12:19.600 --> 12:25.520]  let's fucking get another camera. I went to cam and now I'm running two Sony HD cameras.
[12:25.520 --> 12:29.720]  I got this mic going on. I feel like I upgraded a long way. I got the Joe Rogan mic. I can't
[12:29.720 --> 12:35.040]  forget about the, I just call it the Joe Rogan mic. It's the Shure SM7B, upgraded to that,
[12:35.040 --> 12:38.960]  multi-cam. I feel like we've come a long way. We have nearly-
[12:38.960 --> 12:43.080]  You're still the sound guy at heart though. You can't shake that.
[12:43.080 --> 12:44.320]  The sound guy part of me?
[12:44.320 --> 12:45.320]  Yep.
[12:45.320 --> 12:49.520]  Oh no, that's always going to be in me. Yeah, that was, yeah, I've got a sound guy ear.
[12:49.520 --> 12:53.800]  I'm not trained in sound guy stuff. I've just done enough sound guy stuff to where it's
[12:53.800 --> 12:59.240]  ingrained in me. I'm curious after the show, I want to know what makes you think that,
[12:59.240 --> 13:03.480]  what you see that, or my sound guy stuff.
[13:03.480 --> 13:06.960]  Right now for a hundred dollars, I couldn't list a piece of equipment you'd named off
[13:06.960 --> 13:10.680]  other than like, because that bitch failed on you like a hundred times.
[13:10.680 --> 13:14.280]  Oh, remember the old headphone amp that I wanted to throw through the wall several times?
[13:14.440 --> 13:19.200]  Yep. There was, I'm trying to remember which piece of equipment had the lights that would
[13:19.200 --> 13:21.640]  hypnotize me when I got too baked.
[13:21.640 --> 13:23.920]  Oh, that's funny. That would probably with the compressor.
[13:23.920 --> 13:28.560]  It was a set of audio lights that would bounce and they would get real hypnotic when, when
[13:28.560 --> 13:29.560]  the show got rambly.
[13:29.560 --> 13:34.520]  I love it. Then, yeah, then you would just get more rambly and it would get more hypnotic.
[13:34.520 --> 13:42.120]  Dude, we're close to 10,000 YouTube subscribers for a little show that, yeah, 10,000 subscribers,
[13:42.120 --> 13:47.440]  700 episodes. I had no idea. I thought maybe when we started like a hundred episodes would
[13:47.440 --> 13:50.920]  be the goal. And when we hit a hundred, I was like, two 50 would be fun. And then at
[13:50.920 --> 13:54.680]  two 50, I was like, yeah, 500 seems like a cool goal. And then at 500, something was
[13:54.680 --> 13:58.240]  like, yeah, just do it, dude. It's, it's working. Don't stop.
[13:58.240 --> 14:03.800]  Yep. By 500, I think everybody knew it was on like officially, this was just going to
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.040]  be a steady every Monday. You could count on it. I can't believe you haven't missed
[14:08.040 --> 14:10.120]  a Monday and 700 episodes, dude.
[14:10.440 --> 14:14.000]  Haven't missed a Monday on the podcast. And I don't think I've missed a Monday on the
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.560]  Instagram live. I that's false because there was a time period where my Instagram account
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.840]  was deactivated. Yeah. And then sometimes they block me from going live. Sometimes they
[14:24.840 --> 14:28.440]  close my inbox, right. I can read the messages, but I can't reply Instagram and they, they
[14:28.440 --> 14:34.240]  like to toy with us a little bit, but yeah, for the most part for 700 episodes, like six
[14:34.240 --> 14:38.880]  years ish, I have not missed a Monday and I do my best to put out a show every Thursday
[14:38.880 --> 14:43.520]  as well. I think this actually comes out on a Thursday. So, yeah. Thanks for noticing
[14:43.520 --> 14:47.840]  that, bro. I appreciate that. I say sometimes it's a struggle and sometimes people are like,
[14:47.840 --> 14:50.920]  you want to go do this? And I'm like, ah, no, I got to record a podcast. I'm like, do
[14:50.920 --> 14:54.680]  that tomorrow. And I'm like, oh no, no, no, no, no. It's Tuesday. It's podcast day. Like
[14:54.680 --> 14:59.920]  the whole world might erupt. Yeah. Your inbox would never recover if you missed a Monday.
[14:59.920 --> 15:05.040]  That's that is the damn truth. And then the whole flow of everything would just be wrong.
[15:05.040 --> 15:08.480]  I feel like I'm working my way through the notes here. Pretty good. The evolution of
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.040]  the show has been great. Um, the only thing left to do is like learn how to podcast better
[15:13.040 --> 15:18.320]  and then get more guests on. I need to get, uh, more people on, I need to be on more shows,
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.560]  uh, and maybe possibly some camera upgrades, but I think everything else, bro, the evolution
[15:22.560 --> 15:28.680]  is slowly happening pretty well. I am excited for the seven 10 show. I've been hyping up
[15:28.680 --> 15:33.520]  the seven 10 and I said seven 10 show earlier and Mike was like seven 10. It's not July
[15:33.520 --> 15:39.280]  dude. It's the middle of winter. It was right after a big dab. He like exhaled and started
[15:39.280 --> 15:44.240]  talking about being hyped for the seven 10 show. And I was like, poor guy dabbed himself
[15:44.240 --> 15:49.200]  six months into the future. Yeah, no. A number seven 10. Not, not the date of seven for the
[15:49.200 --> 15:55.120]  July show. Yes. Hey, you gotta be prepared brah. Uh, if I don't start planning ahead,
[15:55.120 --> 15:59.880]  no, but episode number seven 10 is coming up. Uh, I find it, uh, maybe it's odd that
[15:59.880 --> 16:04.680]  I'm more excited about episode seven 10 than I was number 700 because seven 10 it's like,
[16:04.680 --> 16:09.320]  uh, that's like the new four 20. So for a weed podcast, the prop release, the proper
[16:09.320 --> 16:14.520]  celebration episode. Yeah. This is the milestone. So I have a good idea. I'm going to have some
[16:14.520 --> 16:19.640]  friends from discord, send us some great questions and I have a concentrate maker or two in mind.
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.120]  I'm going to try to do this type of a setup with them. Uh, so there will be another zoom,
[16:24.120 --> 16:29.640]  uh, podcast coming up for seven 10, but it will be worth it if I get who I'm really trying to book.
[16:29.880 --> 16:37.720]  Onto the show. I love it. Good hash content is so rare and there's still a lot of just confusion
[16:37.720 --> 16:44.520]  and non-exposure when it comes to the modern hash. So yes. Um, the person I hope to have on,
[16:44.520 --> 16:51.080]  I'm hoping that they can kind of teach us, uh, how to take our garden from, uh, from seed or clone
[16:51.080 --> 16:56.920]  all the way to smokable usable hash without breaking any laws, without using any, uh, illegal,
[16:56.920 --> 17:00.200]  uh, solvents because they've made, if you're making butane hash at home, you're technically
[17:00.200 --> 17:04.440]  breaking the law. So he's going to teach us. I'm hoping they can teach us how to wash it,
[17:04.440 --> 17:08.600]  possibly press it, maybe find one person that washes one person that presses, maybe the same
[17:08.600 --> 17:13.720]  guy will do both. Maybe two guys that do both and let them just give us a rundown of what they do.
[17:13.720 --> 17:18.200]  I've got a bunch of good questions lined up. I'm sure the discord server, uh, my friends on discord
[17:18.200 --> 17:21.960]  have a lot of good questions. Patreon. I'll have a good questions coming. Uh, Patreon guys, if
[17:21.960 --> 17:26.440]  you're watching this and gals, Patreon supporters, uh, if you're watching this and you have good
[17:26.440 --> 17:29.960]  questions for a concentrate maker, go ahead and send them up on Patreon. We'll do my best to get
[17:29.960 --> 17:34.760]  those on the show for you. But that should be the gateway to getting me more people on the show.
[17:34.760 --> 17:39.640]  I've been hesitant, shy of, uh, I'm not a good interviewer, dude. I just, uh, I don't know.
[17:40.680 --> 17:47.640]  It's a weird time for it. And like, everything's just hard right now, travel and getting people
[17:47.640 --> 17:52.120]  around places. And the video chats gotten substantially better than it was four years
[17:52.120 --> 17:58.200]  ago, but, oh yeah. Yeah. I'm just, uh, it's not the technology. Honestly, all excuses. It's me,
[17:58.200 --> 18:02.680]  dude. I'm a, I just, I'm not the best interviewer. Like you could send me questions and I'll have the
[18:02.680 --> 18:05.560]  list of questions. I just can't figure out how to fucking answer my better. It just having a
[18:05.560 --> 18:09.160]  conversation, but, uh, I don't know. Maybe I just need to do that with the interviewers.
[18:09.160 --> 18:14.040]  Uh, I'll get good at it, but hopefully this, uh, seven, 10 interview sparks my inspiration to get
[18:14.040 --> 18:20.920]  some more people on to the show. If you guys out there have guests in mind, uh, or you'd like to be
[18:20.920 --> 18:27.000]  a guest, send me an email or a Patreon email is grow from your heart at hotmail.com. Send me a
[18:27.000 --> 18:32.200]  request to be on the show or a guest recommendation. If you send me a guest recommendation,
[18:32.200 --> 18:37.080]  send me two or three questions to go along with that guest. So I have something to ask them
[18:37.080 --> 18:40.920]  something to get the conversation flowing. If you are trying to be on the show, tell me what
[18:40.920 --> 18:45.720]  we're going to talk about. Uh, tell me why you stand out, why you are, uh, why you're qualified.
[18:45.720 --> 18:49.160]  I know that sounds maybe, uh, conceited or something, but tell me why you're qualified to
[18:49.160 --> 18:54.520]  teach my audience, your knowledge, why we would put you on the show? It's a platform. So can't just
[18:54.520 --> 18:58.760]  let you come out here in your underwear and talk about crazy shit. Got to kind of qualify. That's
[18:58.760 --> 19:04.600]  my job. Whoa. That's why I don't take people live on Instagram with me, dude. I'm on the Instagram
[19:04.600 --> 19:08.200]  live show every Monday and people like, can I jump in your live? And I'm like, there's no way to
[19:08.200 --> 19:13.400]  preview this. I just hit live and you're with me. And you could be, you'd be in your underwear or
[19:13.400 --> 19:16.440]  not in your underwear. You could be wearing less than your underwear. You could be naked
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.200]  doing regular insane. There's perfectly clothed insane. And then you're right there. Well, I can
[19:24.200 --> 19:27.000]  hit the X and get rid of you, but if you're naked, everybody already sent you naked and
[19:27.000 --> 19:31.560]  then it's too late. But that's why I don't take people live with me. If anybody was wondering.
[19:31.560 --> 19:39.720]  All right. And we do need to get you on more, Mike. Um, I'm talking about guests and such.
[19:39.720 --> 19:44.440]  Oh, you just, as you say, we need to get you on more. I hear the audio monitor go off behind me.
[19:44.520 --> 19:48.920]  Oh, are the kids cool? Everyone good. One of them's talking in his sleep. I think.
[19:48.920 --> 19:54.120]  Nice. Let's hear what he's saying, dude. Put them on the show. I'm not going to edit this out.
[19:58.440 --> 20:03.320]  All right. Yeah. Wondering where I'm at. Like what just happened is where I'm at.
[20:03.880 --> 20:07.800]  Yeah. Mike's got to, uh, 7 30 in the morning as early as fuck.
[20:07.800 --> 20:12.920]  Studley, handsome, fucking cool little guys. Those are you're making cool little men, dude. I'm proud
[20:12.920 --> 20:18.680]  of you for that. Uh, they're going to be cool, man. Yeah. Yeah. Like I, like, even I noticed that
[20:18.680 --> 20:23.240]  like, I'm doing a pretty awesome job with it. It's just, it's exhausting. Like it's a 16 hour a day
[20:23.240 --> 20:29.000]  job. Yeah. Yeah. And when it's like, let's get three hours to podcast. It's like, I just, there's
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.560]  no energy left there. That's all right. We'll fire you up. We'll get you moving for a podcast. Big
[20:33.560 --> 20:37.400]  shout out to the boys for letting dad podcast. Also big shout out to the wife. I don't know if
[20:37.400 --> 20:41.960]  she'll watch this or hear this, but fist bump to the wife for watching also fist bump for the help
[20:41.960 --> 20:47.720]  you're giving me on that other thing I asked for help. I appreciate you. They get older,
[20:47.720 --> 20:53.800]  breaking away gets easier. Yeah. So sure. We're getting there little by little by little. I can
[20:53.800 --> 20:57.880]  edit this out. If I'm crossing any lines, you just tell me, but I never know until I ask, um,
[20:58.760 --> 21:04.840]  when, uh, and I know there's not a number, but when do you think it's going to be time to, um,
[21:04.840 --> 21:12.360]  explain to them and talk to them about cannabis? Well, sort of already have started
[21:12.360 --> 21:18.520]  in like the oldest one, six and the youngest ones, three. And like right now it's just dad
[21:18.520 --> 21:27.400]  disappears into the garage, like for dad time. And, uh, the, the older one, like he goes and
[21:27.400 --> 21:32.920]  takes a lot of time in his room and he goes and takes personal time. Just like I do the thing
[21:32.920 --> 21:40.360]  people do. And so I've kind of talked to him a little bit, like very kind of surface level,
[21:41.240 --> 21:47.560]  you know, no details. Like I just, I'm out there doing stuff that like it's for adults, not kids.
[21:48.440 --> 21:55.240]  Like it's just, that's where we're at with it right now. Like the three year old, it's just
[21:55.240 --> 22:01.240]  like, he wants to do everything with me and he doesn't get away from time to time, but you're a
[22:01.240 --> 22:05.000]  six year old. I'm going to interrupt you. Uh, you're a six year old dude. That's he's not six,
[22:05.000 --> 22:09.880]  but he's fucking 16. Like when I talked to him, I'm like, what, how did, who am I talking to over
[22:09.880 --> 22:13.720]  here? Is this is not somebody's little kid. This is somebody's like uncle or somebody over here.
[22:15.000 --> 22:21.880]  The, the combination of, um, all of the medical procedures and stuff that he's had to go through
[22:21.880 --> 22:28.520]  in his six years and COVID just being home with me for a year and a half, but just hanging out
[22:28.520 --> 22:34.520]  with me. I was his, his playmate. Like I was the daycare kids. I was the teacher's aid, like all of
[22:34.520 --> 22:41.720]  it. Like that shit had an impact. Like the way he taught the world is directly framed by those two
[22:41.720 --> 22:46.680]  things. Yeah. That makes a huge difference. Yeah. He's not hanging out with a cartoon, watching
[22:46.680 --> 22:51.320]  booger picking kids. He's hanging out with dad all day long. That's kind of cool. Dude, I see it.
[22:51.320 --> 22:55.080]  I'm not trying to talk. I've been trying to make this the fatherhood podcast, but, uh, it was a
[22:55.080 --> 22:59.240]  good opportunity to ask, like, when do we start talking about our kids about smoke and herb?
[22:59.240 --> 23:06.200]  Like, just cause I like your, uh, your, your, uh, your model of parenting. We're very much, um, like
[23:06.200 --> 23:11.000]  my wife and I, we, uh, we sort of helped raise two of our nieces already. They're in their twenties now.
[23:11.720 --> 23:18.280]  Um, but we were not parental, but like parental adjacent figures for them for their whole lives.
[23:18.280 --> 23:24.520]  And we just went with brutal honesty was the whole point. Like you have to put it in the context.
[23:24.520 --> 23:33.320]  It's age appropriate, but, um, just, we don't lie to them. We just, we frame it appropriately.
[23:33.320 --> 23:39.400]  And so it's not daddy's outside doing dabs. It's dad's taking personal time. We're going to give
[23:39.400 --> 23:45.080]  dad 15 or 20 minutes. And then that'll line right about up with dinner being ready and
[23:47.160 --> 23:53.240]  all right. Just roll right through it. We do the same thing with wine or, or alcoholic beverages.
[23:53.320 --> 23:56.200]  You know, it's adult juice. Don't worry about it. You don't need to,
[23:56.840 --> 24:00.360]  okay. They don't like the smell of it. They're not interested in it or anything.
[24:02.120 --> 24:08.920]  My daughter is 18 and I know, Oh dude. Yeah. I was going to say, I know she dabs. She dabs
[24:08.920 --> 24:16.280]  with her friends. She dabs at that, uh, the house. Um, I don't necessarily buy her flowers or
[24:16.280 --> 24:22.520]  concentrates, but if she needs something, I like I'll give her a ride to the dispensary, but I won't
[24:22.520 --> 24:27.880]  go in and get it for her. Like, I don't like, I'm not against it or anything. And if I really had
[24:27.880 --> 24:33.320]  to, I would, but there's gotta be some, like when I was her age, dude, we had to go find weed.
[24:33.320 --> 24:37.960]  Like you had to find somebody with weed and then he had to have money to get weed. And then he had
[24:37.960 --> 24:41.480]  to buy the weed and pick all the fucking seeds out of it before he could smoke some of it.
[24:42.040 --> 24:46.120]  Like, I don't care that she smokes. I'm happy. Go for it, dude. Chill out, have a good time,
[24:46.120 --> 24:51.000]  but I'm not going to make it super easy. Like you gotta do some of it. Like, I'm not going to show
[24:51.000 --> 24:56.520]  up with a bag of weed for her, but if she spent some of her birthday money on a bag of weed,
[24:56.520 --> 25:03.000]  I don't care. Like, that's kind of how I feel about it. Like part of me wishes the current
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.360]  generation had to go through some of the shit that we did when we were teenagers to acquire herb.
[25:08.920 --> 25:17.240]  And part of me is really glad they don't have to. Cause like, yeah, we got lucky. Kinda. Yeah. Like
[25:17.240 --> 25:21.960]  it only got ugly and scary a couple of times. Right. Oh, I wouldn't want my daughter messing
[25:21.960 --> 25:26.520]  with a couple of my weed guys from back in the day. Oh, right. But like, yeah, I don't want my
[25:26.520 --> 25:33.640]  kids driving three hours because that's where the weeds, the best price, like the three hour drive
[25:33.640 --> 25:38.920]  is worth the $75 savings. Yeah. Now, now she goes to the dispensary down the street and she's 18
[25:38.920 --> 25:43.960]  and got a weed card so she can go in there and get plenty. And like all the crap, like if there
[25:43.960 --> 25:50.200]  were rocks and stuff in the pound, what was sprayed on it? Right. Yeah. No, I always troll
[25:50.200 --> 25:54.360]  her. I'm like, you've never even picked seeds out of weed. Like I always want to just like get her
[25:54.360 --> 25:57.880]  weed and throw a bunch of seeds in it and be like, now dig that shit out of there before you smoke.
[25:57.880 --> 26:04.920]  See, that's what it used to be like. She's right. Smoking with somebody and they would scissor
[26:04.920 --> 26:12.440]  stuff off a brick into a metal colander and then grind on it with like a pedestal from a mortar
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.680]  and pestle. Oh yeah. Yeah. And so you'd have the little colander and you just grind around
[26:19.240 --> 26:26.840]  this lump of compacted herbs. Yeah. Yep. And then one day somebody showed up with real weed and I
[26:26.840 --> 26:31.160]  was like, what do you, what do you have? Like, this is kind bud, not compressed brick weed.
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.600]  And I was like, well, let's smoke that. And my brain went, yep. And then it was already slept
[26:36.600 --> 26:41.960]  for seven hours. Yeah. Yeah. Well then I had to learn where to get it. And then I had to learn
[26:41.960 --> 26:46.440]  how to grow it. And then I had to learn how to breed it. And that's bad, dude. That's where we
[26:46.440 --> 26:50.040]  are today. Yeah. Somebody showed up with some really good weed and it blew my fucking brains.
[26:50.680 --> 26:55.880]  Um, yeah, so that was a weird segue from asking when you're going to, uh, talk about cannabis with
[26:55.880 --> 27:01.880]  your kid. I can't wait to, uh, uh, smoke a fat one with both of them. Like I can't wait. The time
[27:01.880 --> 27:07.640]  will come a long way, but like, it's, it's an event I'm desperately looking forward to. I gotta
[27:07.640 --> 27:11.400]  beat the older one on a foot race. Uh, he thinks he can run faster than me. You guys
[27:11.960 --> 27:17.880]  that ain't happening. It's so funny. Every time I mentioned you or he sees something, uh, with your
[27:17.880 --> 27:23.080]  face on except got, I read merch all over the place. Um, he's like, I still have to race him.
[27:23.080 --> 27:30.360]  He owes me. I do. I owe the kid a foot race. Yep. I do. Um, yeah, but that, no, I can't wait,
[27:30.360 --> 27:33.320]  dude. He's super rad. All right. We've been talking about kids a lot. I don't remember what
[27:33.320 --> 27:39.480]  I was rambling about. I had a segue. It fell out of my brain. Um, parents is an excellent
[27:39.480 --> 27:43.640]  sort of little piece of this show that we can do when I'm on. Yeah, it definitely is. Uh,
[27:43.640 --> 27:49.080]  because it's why you're never here. So it correlates very well. Like it's an interesting
[27:49.080 --> 27:54.680]  balance that I think I get it from older people in my family that are like, so how are you the pot
[27:54.680 --> 28:02.440]  guy? And like the good dad. And it's like, well, it's, it's, you just said it. Yeah. It's not hard.
[28:03.400 --> 28:08.120]  Is it the kids? Like it's not complicated. Grow rooms locked and secured and in another place.
[28:08.120 --> 28:12.120]  And the kids are up there doing their thing. It's like two different, yeah. Two different
[28:12.120 --> 28:19.080]  segments of life. How to cops would be good parents called a gun cabinet. Yeah. And it's
[28:19.080 --> 28:27.640]  like a gun safe, but it's cheaper. Oh, you cut out Mike. So nobody can hear what you're saying,
[28:27.640 --> 28:31.480]  but I don't even think you can hear me. So right now in the podcast, it'll just be me talking over
[28:31.480 --> 28:35.160]  for you. Um, now you're totally froze. I'm just going to keep talking for a couple of seconds,
[28:35.160 --> 28:39.080]  guys. It looks like Mike is totally frozen. Uh, we'll give him a minute to recover.
[28:39.080 --> 28:43.480]  He's tapping his back. There you go, brother. Welcome back. You were talking about gun cabinet.
[28:43.480 --> 28:48.280]  They got a good cabinet. You get a thing online called a gun cabinet and like, it's like a gun
[28:48.280 --> 28:54.040]  safe, but it's way lighter. And mine came perfect. It's got a little section for my little two foot
[28:54.040 --> 28:59.240]  bong. And then it's got a little shelves for my weed and my hash and my gummies. And it's got a
[28:59.240 --> 29:04.600]  nice, easy key system. Super simple. Right. That's perfect. Keep everything away from the
[29:04.600 --> 29:09.640]  little ones. It's all you got to do in the house is not at all complicated. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.040]  house. And even if it wasn't, there's, there's more than one room. Yeah. Well, and that's,
[29:14.680 --> 29:18.520]  it's one of those things. Like when you're thinking about laws is you got to have a place
[29:18.520 --> 29:23.480]  to go smoke if you're in an apartment. Like, and that was how I got people to make it legal to
[29:23.480 --> 29:28.200]  smoke on porches down here. As I just pointed out, like, what about apartment smokers? You
[29:28.200 --> 29:31.960]  really want parents sitting in stuck in an apartment because that's where it's only legal
[29:31.960 --> 29:37.000]  to smoke. Like let the parent go outside. Very true. Let the parent go outside. That's
[29:37.560 --> 29:39.960]  immediately changed that in the law before we pass it.
[29:41.720 --> 29:43.960]  Uh, did you hear the grateful dog episode, Mike?
[29:44.600 --> 29:49.080]  I did. I greatly enjoyed it. I've been waiting for that episode for years.
[29:49.080 --> 29:53.480]  I kind of wanted to get you on it, but also knew that that episode would have been three times as
[29:53.480 --> 29:59.720]  long if I put you on there. So I just did. Yes. Yes. So I just did it by myself. Um, what, what,
[29:59.720 --> 30:03.080]  uh, what would you have contributed, bro? You got a big smile on your face when I asked you about it.
[30:03.880 --> 30:08.600]  It was such a fun episode to listen to. Cause so when he's talking about, like,
[30:08.600 --> 30:12.680]  I got seeds from such and such, like I remember sitting in his, his basement,
[30:13.720 --> 30:19.560]  um, smoking or bagging up weed and him sitting there. Should I get this, this genetic or that
[30:19.560 --> 30:23.560]  genetic? Well, they have these five on the website. Like which three should I order?
[30:24.440 --> 30:31.880]  Um, these ones got seized, had to order them again, which one thrived, what dumb ass merch
[30:31.880 --> 30:37.160]  was sent with the seeds. Like I remember, Oh yeah. It's like, there was a line in the episode
[30:37.160 --> 30:42.760]  where you talk about, uh, rolling up joints before going to red rocks for Ray guy on the rocks. And I
[30:42.760 --> 30:49.000]  distinctly remember sitting at your kitchen table, grinding herb for you to roll joints with knowing
[30:49.000 --> 30:53.560]  that you were going to reggae on the rocks and me, not at all being interested in reggae on the
[30:53.560 --> 30:58.760]  rocks, but we're hanging out smoking a recording that night. So I'm sitting there with the grinder
[30:58.760 --> 31:07.480]  for hours while you roll up 40 dubes. Yup. Like, yeah, we used to, uh, I remember the easy cloner
[31:07.480 --> 31:12.440]  showing up and you hit that part in that episode too. Like, yeah, it was fun. Little evolutions.
[31:12.440 --> 31:16.760]  I was there for, it was just a fun episode to hear. Cool. Plus the people dogs still my favorite
[31:16.840 --> 31:21.720]  of your genetics. I'm glad you said that before I had to ask you if it was your favorite. I love
[31:21.720 --> 31:26.680]  hearing that. That's your favorite. There's not a grateful dog shirt. Like, I don't know what that
[31:26.680 --> 31:32.680]  shirt would be, but it would be a picture of Jerry Garcia and David Grissman because it's a band name.
[31:32.680 --> 31:39.640]  So I can't really make my own shirt of a favorite shirt or my favorite strain of shirt. I don't want
[31:39.640 --> 31:44.840]  to wear. Yeah. Well, I can't do it. I can't make it because I'd probably get sued by whoever owns
[31:44.840 --> 31:52.440]  the grateful beds stuff. Jerry's stuff, David Grissman stuff. Yeah. Uh, but if anybody out
[31:52.440 --> 31:57.560]  there wants to make a bootleg grateful dog shirt, I wear an extra large and Mike's probably into a
[31:57.560 --> 32:04.520]  three X at this point. Hey, give or take the pandemic's been rough. He quit smoking. Hey,
[32:04.520 --> 32:09.320]  he quit smoking. So we'll give him that credit. Yeah. Right at the start of this fucking thing
[32:09.320 --> 32:15.800]  too. That looks like you just smoked bacon in March. We cook. That's what we do is like,
[32:15.800 --> 32:20.840]  it's part of the routine with the kids is we cook all goddamn time. Yeah. Delicious,
[32:20.840 --> 32:27.880]  wonderful food that there's a lot of. Oh, I really want to go off on a grub hub rant,
[32:27.880 --> 32:34.280]  but we'll keep the show positive today. Um, I don't have a lot more notes. I do have one more
[32:34.280 --> 32:39.240]  good question for you. Um, and I should have thought about my answer before I asked you this,
[32:39.240 --> 32:43.960]  because I don't have an answer to this question right now. Um, do you have a favorite product of
[32:43.960 --> 32:48.360]  the year we're wrapping up this year? Uh, it's almost Christmas time as we're recording here.
[32:48.360 --> 32:54.360]  Uh, it's been a good year. Do you have a favorite, uh, medical or recreational cannabis product from
[32:54.360 --> 33:00.440]  this year? The rec products I buy the most, I don't know. Favorite.
[33:00.520 --> 33:06.520]  Oh, you just completely cut out. That's really funny. Uh, I'm trying to get his attention. You
[33:06.520 --> 33:11.400]  guys, I'm waving at him. There you go. Uh, we'll, I'll just talk till he comes right back in. Um,
[33:11.400 --> 33:15.480]  he's leaning toward the mic. He's shaking his head, but you guys right now, send me a tweet
[33:15.480 --> 33:19.160]  or an email and tell me what your favorite product was. There we go. We're getting him back. Tell me
[33:19.160 --> 33:24.040]  what your favorite, uh, medical or recreational cannabis product was this year. What got you
[33:24.040 --> 33:29.080]  zooted? What worked best medical or recreationally for you? Uh, and I will let Mike continue on with
[33:29.080 --> 33:35.160]  his story of his favorite product of the year. So the, the stuff I buy the most often is either
[33:35.160 --> 33:45.800]  taste buds, gummies, a rec part product that is spectacular. Um, and then, uh, green dot black
[33:45.800 --> 33:55.240]  label stuff, the, the batters and the cartridges, bro. Yeah. That would be my favorite product of
[33:55.240 --> 34:03.400]  the year as well. They do not pay me. I pay cash for these products straight up. Um, this particular
[34:03.400 --> 34:07.560]  dispensary gives me a discount. The deal has nothing to do with green dots because I was the
[34:07.560 --> 34:12.360]  first customer to shop in this dispensary when they opened for recreational cannabis sales.
[34:12.360 --> 34:17.320]  So I've got kind of a VIP hookup there, but honestly, that's full disclosure. They gave me
[34:17.320 --> 34:23.960]  the VIP pricing. I don't get these for free. Green dot does not pay me promote advertise anything.
[34:24.440 --> 34:30.600]  I pick fucking retail and I'm still shouting them out. Yeah. And, uh, the funny part is you're like,
[34:30.600 --> 34:34.600]  well, Rasta Jeff, you get that fat discount. Why don't you go get some for Mike? Because I buy my
[34:34.600 --> 34:39.960]  damn limit. I buy the limit and Mike knows I'm getting eight of them. When I go, the limit is
[34:39.960 --> 34:46.040]  so funny. We, uh, we can't find the time to get on zoom for an hour. Like if we could get to the
[34:46.040 --> 34:52.200]  dispenser together. Yeah. Cause, uh, you don't get your limit and I'd have you get me some flowers
[34:52.200 --> 34:55.320]  so that I could try that a flower there that I wanted the other day. But I was like, well,
[34:55.320 --> 34:59.080]  I'm not going to miss a grandma concentrates to try those flowers.
[35:00.280 --> 35:05.480]  The limits tight now, especially with edibles. And I've been going through a boatload of those
[35:05.480 --> 35:10.440]  gummies. So I've like, I walk in and I'm like, give me two of those, two of those, two of those,
[35:10.440 --> 35:15.320]  two of those. And they're like, please stop saying things so that I don't have to cut you off.
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.240]  Right. Yeah. Then they realize when you stop like, Oh, this guy knows what's up.
[35:19.240 --> 35:23.480]  Big shout out to my buddy, Ricky, one of the best blood tenders in town. I don't often shout
[35:23.480 --> 35:28.280]  out bud tenders. Big up to that Ricky. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about? That's a good dude.
[35:28.280 --> 35:33.080]  Not just a good bud tender, but a good dude. Um, yeah, dude, the green dot black labels,
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.440]  probably my product of the year. Anything with the, uh, what did I have just the other day? Damn,
[35:38.440 --> 35:43.880]  I just finished at the fat. So did I had a jaw, four gram jar of fat. So anything with the GMO,
[35:43.880 --> 35:49.960]  the garlic, the Han Solo burger, anything in that realm from them? Uh, I've tried fucking,
[35:49.960 --> 35:55.160]  I'll take it, dude. I love it. Uh, I love the, I think you had a jar of the Holy fuck. I love it.
[35:55.720 --> 36:00.280]  Had so much of it. I've had so much of it. I'll pass. I'll buy something different. If they got
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.440]  the Holy fuck and something else probably take something else just because I've spent so much of
[36:04.440 --> 36:10.680]  it. That grandma, I just held up. I've been saving and I saved it until tonight. I rewarded myself by
[36:10.680 --> 36:16.120]  finally getting my podcast stuff set up with a gram or a nice little dab out of that. And it was,
[36:16.120 --> 36:20.120]  that's what I was coughing on when you, uh, when you let me into the meeting.
[36:21.800 --> 36:26.200]  Nice. I love it. When I opened up the zoom meeting, Mike hits the, uh, the let me into
[36:26.200 --> 36:30.440]  the damn zoom meeting button. And I look up to let him in and I click accept. And then all I hear is
[36:32.760 --> 36:36.440]  Mike's just taking a big old fat bong, right? Yeah. He's got his hand like one moment, sir.
[36:37.160 --> 36:41.400]  I gotcha buddy. I gotcha. Yeah. Shout out to the little blue rig.
[36:42.920 --> 36:49.240]  Yeah, dude. I'm, I don't want to jinx myself. This rig, uh, this rig has been around. I need
[36:49.240 --> 36:54.360]  to clean my banger. I need to clean the rig. But this thing, uh, this thing, a little sidecar has
[36:54.360 --> 36:58.520]  been, people talk about their favorite Reagan. Should I like, it's just the right size. It's
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.000]  got the flared mouthpiece. So I don't have to like put my mouth on a phallic shaped thing.
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.720]  It's a nice and short, all the smoke goes down the stem and to my brain, dude, I love it.
[37:07.720 --> 37:13.000]  Love it. Love it. Love it. Yeah. All right, bro. We've been going for like 30 minutes.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.320]  Um, at the end of these podcasts, when I've gone through all of my notes, I like to give you
[37:17.320 --> 37:21.480]  the Mike's moments. It's been a long year. You don't get to be on here very often. And if I need
[37:21.480 --> 37:26.120]  to edit this out, I can, if I gave you a microphone and some time to yourself. And I was like, Mike,
[37:26.120 --> 37:30.200]  go ahead and ramble about whatever you want to get off your chest today. What kind of shit would
[37:30.200 --> 37:40.920]  you have to say? That's so tricky. Cause, uh, one of my, my hesitancies, uh, get my setup going.
[37:40.920 --> 37:45.400]  One of the little procrastination tools I've been throwing around in my head is like, I just
[37:46.120 --> 37:54.200]  try not to bring random politics stuff to the show, but, um, the safe banking act, if you follow
[37:54.200 --> 37:58.760]  stuff going on in Congress, they were going to give legal cannabis access to banking.
[37:59.480 --> 38:05.880]  Um, some people were all for it. Others are against it. Um, even in the community, there's,
[38:05.880 --> 38:10.760]  there's weird resistance because everybody's afraid of the corporate takeover, which will be
[38:10.760 --> 38:16.840]  hastened by full access to banking. But that failed again, which is disappointing. The community's
[38:16.840 --> 38:23.240]  still so fragmented that they can kick our issues down the, down the street for decades. And nothing
[38:24.040 --> 38:29.640]  Fear of the bank being able to be involved is what is keeping your business afloat. Your business
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.280]  plan is wrong. You got to re-strategize if that's, what's worrying you, that's your argument for not
[38:34.280 --> 38:40.200]  being able to use the banks. Uh, that's, that's a, uh, it's a insecurity. That's a weird fear.
[38:40.760 --> 38:49.080]  That's a poorly planned for you can fix that. Like it's a major kind of, I don't know,
[38:49.080 --> 38:55.080]  stumbling block in legal cannabis right now is an access to capital. Um, we can't go to the bank
[38:55.080 --> 39:00.600]  and get a business loan. You have to know somebody with private capital or you have to have, um,
[39:00.600 --> 39:06.360]  private investment. And it's just a brutal system that survive. I mean, it's cutthroat. It's why
[39:06.360 --> 39:15.160]  owners are so stereotypically douchebaggy. It gets, it's that's who's, who's funding it right
[39:15.160 --> 39:20.120]  now. It's not somebody trying to pay off a business loan over 40 years. It's somebody
[39:20.120 --> 39:26.360]  looking to triple their investment quick and get out of the new hot thing. That explains a lot of
[39:26.360 --> 39:32.120]  a thing that I talk about on this show. Often, um, uh, the commercial industry can beat the
[39:32.120 --> 39:37.080]  shit out of a grower with passion because I became a lead grower and this has happened in
[39:37.080 --> 39:41.720]  more than one environment. And once you're in the commercial industry, you realize it's kind of a
[39:41.720 --> 39:48.200]  joke. It's kind of a trend. There's an owner who has finagled some money out of somebody,
[39:48.200 --> 39:53.880]  some people, a group, a person with money. He's gotten an owner has investors, maybe multiple
[39:53.880 --> 40:00.360]  investors. Uh, then the owner has, uh, probably two investors. Then they've got a lead grower and
[40:00.360 --> 40:05.080]  a grow team. And they're telling different stories to everybody because that investor every day wants
[40:05.080 --> 40:09.320]  their money back. The grower's telling them I need nine weeks to get it done. They're telling
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.320]  the grower that they're going to, they just, so it's that pressure from that investor that all of
[40:13.320 --> 40:17.560]  a sudden they're weirdness. All of a sudden they're asking the grower if they can shorten
[40:17.560 --> 40:21.720]  the flowering time to six weeks. And it's like, that's not how fucking nature works. Yeah. They
[40:21.720 --> 40:25.480]  tell the investor, we'll have it done in eight weeks. The grower says nine. They tell me I got
[40:25.480 --> 40:29.560]  to have it done in seven when it doesn't reach the harvest goals because we took it down two
[40:29.560 --> 40:34.840]  weeks early because the fucking owner of the place was getting, uh, ridiculously overzealous.
[40:34.840 --> 40:38.680]  It doesn't reach the goals or the potency. Then the investor gets mad about us not making the
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.320]  money we should have made. Like it's a weird dynamic. If we could get those real bank loans,
[40:43.320 --> 40:49.080]  uh, and have actual like different, everything would be different with a decent fucking APR and
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.600]  actually just get a loan. Know that we got to pay this back over this time is we have to sell this
[40:52.600 --> 40:56.520]  much product. That means our first year we could struggle by year two and three. We could be going
[40:56.520 --> 41:00.680]  by year five. We're banging by 10. We're all paid off. Like you can make that kind of plan. But when
[41:00.680 --> 41:05.240]  you got crazy investors, uh, it goes kind of weird. Sometimes you don't get to do all the things that
[41:05.240 --> 41:10.440]  you were hoping. Um, sometimes they dangle more money over you. They're like, Oh, we'll give you
[41:10.440 --> 41:13.320]  more money after your first harvest and you harvest and they don't give it to you and you
[41:13.320 --> 41:17.640]  promised people bonuses and then there's no bonuses to be given cause you didn't get the money.
[41:18.360 --> 41:22.680]  Anyway, that's everything's so tight because it's all private capital and it's just, it's just one
[41:22.680 --> 41:28.680]  of the, one more thing that's, it's how many different things we have to overcome. Yeah.
[41:28.680 --> 41:33.720]  Right. And there's so many of us, it's, it's one in three Americans. So there's 120 million of us.
[41:34.360 --> 41:39.800]  And if we could all just get together for 45 minutes on one Wednesday, everything would be
[41:39.800 --> 41:45.000]  different. You know, it was just the random stoner thought of the night. I like it. Now that's what
[41:45.000 --> 41:49.320]  I gave you this, uh, this Mike's moments, this open platform. That's what it was for. Uh, any of
[41:49.320 --> 41:53.160]  the people that don't like listening to the politics, uh, they got to listen to a good 30
[41:53.160 --> 41:56.920]  minutes show and then they can not, uh, not hear this part if they're not into it and we don't have
[41:56.920 --> 42:03.000]  to listen to their comments. Yeah. Good show to start. Like everybody gets down on politics,
[42:03.000 --> 42:07.240]  but it's like how everything functions. I was just scanning headlines and I don't have the
[42:07.240 --> 42:13.320]  time right now that I used to have to really keep up on like every state's path through legalization.
[42:14.120 --> 42:20.520]  But I saw that New York just had a whole bunch of counties or I think they call them counties in New
[42:20.520 --> 42:29.000]  York, a whole bunch of geographical squares of space, um, borderlines opt out or refuse to opt
[42:29.000 --> 42:35.000]  into legal cannabis. So they're going to be like Colorado where you can buy urban in Manitou,
[42:35.000 --> 42:41.800]  but not Colorado Springs or you can get urban Pueblo, but not in, um, Walsenberg. I think you
[42:41.800 --> 42:47.640]  can get weed in Walsenberg, but yeah, I guess 60 some counties in Colorado where you still can't
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.400]  buy herb. You've got to drive to the next County over in some counties it's made ridiculously rich
[42:53.400 --> 42:58.920]  because it's a small County next to a big County and the big counties refuse to opt in. So the
[42:58.920 --> 43:07.640]  little County has never seen more funding like Trinidad. Um, but, uh, if you're not involved,
[43:07.640 --> 43:13.720]  especially at the local level, like just weird stuff happens and you don't want to miss out on
[43:13.720 --> 43:17.880]  this, you don't, especially if you only go to the dispensary a couple of times a year, you don't
[43:17.880 --> 43:23.400]  want to have to drive three counties over. Right. And pay ridiculous taxes. Uh, plenty of people
[43:23.400 --> 43:29.640]  drive to another County just to avoid 30, 32, 35% taxes on cannabis. When you're buying a product
[43:29.640 --> 43:34.680]  that costs 200 bucks, that's 60 bucks in taxes. If you didn't have to pay that, imagine how much
[43:34.680 --> 43:41.160]  more product you could leave with it. Uh, the taxes right now are incredibly brutal because
[43:41.160 --> 43:47.480]  it's still illegal federally. So federal tax rule two 80 E applies and you can't deduct all the
[43:47.480 --> 43:52.280]  normal expenses from your business taxes. Like that's where the industry's health insurance is
[43:52.280 --> 43:57.400]  right there. Oh yeah. That's the health insurance money. That's the bonus money. That's the raises
[43:57.400 --> 44:05.160]  money. It's just one of those things. I still love legal cannabis. I wouldn't go back for anything.
[44:05.720 --> 44:10.360]  Like I laugh at people pretending that they'd go back to illegal herb. Oh no, we don't. Unless you
[44:10.360 --> 44:15.960]  were a home grower back then, like everybody else is way better off. And then you should have
[44:15.960 --> 44:21.000]  evolved by now. You should be leading a dispensary or at least being a top notch grower at a dispensary
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.080]  or a consultant. You should have evolved and adjusted and adapted because those times are
[44:25.080 --> 44:30.200]  changing. Uh, maybe that's a good heads up to people who are in markets which are about to
[44:30.200 --> 44:33.880]  change or have recently changed, bro. If you're an illegal grower and you're just doing the black
[44:33.880 --> 44:38.760]  market thing, there will always be a demand and a need for the free market. But a lot of those are
[44:38.760 --> 44:42.440]  going to go away. You may want to re strategize. You may want to come up with something new
[44:42.440 --> 44:47.640]  because eventually a lot of those gray market free market opportunities, those disappear when the
[44:47.640 --> 44:53.800]  legal market comes. So be ready for all that. The squeeze comes quick. I mean, I remember,
[44:53.800 --> 44:57.400]  and it doesn't seem like that long ago, but like me and Jeff said earlier, we're old now,
[44:58.120 --> 45:04.440]  older now. Um, you used to be able to make a perfectly respectable living with four or five
[45:04.440 --> 45:10.760]  lights, three or four lights. Even, um, if you ran a tight ship, you could have three or four
[45:10.760 --> 45:18.440]  grow lights and a house and to have a set of regular customers and make a perfectly
[45:18.440 --> 45:24.200]  respectable living. Oh yeah. And that went away about an hour and a half after legalization
[45:24.200 --> 45:30.760]  landed. And you started to see, do you remember all the people who tried to make a dispensary in
[45:30.760 --> 45:38.680]  their living room? Oh yeah. Nailed shelves to the wall and had jars up and yeah. For a minute there,
[45:38.680 --> 45:42.280]  that was how half of our town survived. We're going to talk about that a lot more. Mike,
[45:42.280 --> 45:47.240]  I've got another episode planned. I should give you a heads up now. Um, my goal is to have episode
[45:47.240 --> 45:53.480]  719 about our city and the cannabis rescue. Oh, that's beautiful. That our city is giving us.
[45:53.480 --> 45:55.720]  The 719 episode? That's beautiful. Yes. We'll make it about our,
[45:55.720 --> 46:01.080]  our area code here is 719 folks. So we're going to do 719. We'll be about cannabis in the 719.
[46:01.080 --> 46:05.080]  We'll talk about how many jobs we've provided, uh, and how things have gone like that. And
[46:05.080 --> 46:08.600]  something I'll let Mike talk about. So Mike, when we get done here, start writing.
[46:08.600 --> 46:13.160]  Yeah. You just gave me a bunch of homework. So Mike, we were talking about some greedy people.
[46:13.160 --> 46:17.560]  In my opinion, it would just be greedy people would be the people that did not want legalization
[46:17.560 --> 46:24.360]  to happen. I would never undo legalization. People in jail for cannabis is like, that is,
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.520]  that's a word that we're not supposed to say. Yes. Yeah. That's a word we're not supposed to
[46:28.520 --> 46:33.400]  say anymore in this time of the year and this climate and this culture is how I feel about that.
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.720]  Um, yeah, people should be able to consume cannabis and not have fear of getting locked
[46:37.720 --> 46:41.400]  up just for smoking a plant. People can do, we should be able to do most of whatever we want,
[46:41.400 --> 46:45.080]  if it doesn't bug anybody. So I'd never undo that. That's not something I would change.
[46:45.080 --> 46:50.520]  I changed a lot of my, uh, a lot of my world. It made me grow, dude. It made me, that's funny. It
[46:50.520 --> 46:56.200]  made me grow. I didn't even mean it that way. It made me grow as a person. It made me grow. It
[46:56.200 --> 47:01.240]  made me grow business-wise in a lot of ways. It made me grow commercially, but it made me grow,
[47:01.240 --> 47:06.200]  uh, as an adult, as a person, as a business person. Otherwise, what, what are we going to do?
[47:06.200 --> 47:10.760]  What was I going to do to sell weed forever, grow weed and sell weed forever. I had to evolve and
[47:10.760 --> 47:15.640]  move with the times. I couldn't just have a, that couldn't be my hustle forever. I did learn other
[47:15.640 --> 47:21.640]  things and evolve. Yeah. At a certain point that would have gotten really old. Yeah. Um, I was
[47:21.640 --> 47:25.080]  tired of it when it was ending. I was done with it when it, that's why it, yeah, that's why we
[47:25.080 --> 47:30.520]  evolved it by the time it went away. Yeah. It's, uh, watching all the different, different evolutions
[47:30.520 --> 47:37.960]  has been really cool. I'm still wishing more people would get involved. It's, uh, um, if we
[47:37.960 --> 47:43.880]  could just come together for like five minutes community is we got 10,000 subscribers to the
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.960]  show. Like everybody tell two friends about the growth from your heart podcast. Yeah. That's,
[47:47.960 --> 47:51.880]  that's a good segue. Uh, this is a good time to like, and subscribe Mike's Mike's high and running
[47:51.880 --> 47:55.800]  out of steam. I can see it on his face. Uh, but do you, yeah, it's like one in the morning and
[47:55.800 --> 47:59.960]  7.00 AM was a long time ago. It's all right. I pumped some energy back into, Oh, Mike is saying
[47:59.960 --> 48:04.520]  like, and subscribe right now. And then have two friends like, and subscribe also. Like I gave you,
[48:04.520 --> 48:09.400]  uh, your Mike's moments. Uh, it is getting pretty late here. You are correct. I still do have some
[48:09.400 --> 48:13.880]  editing work to do. We got to put some fanciness at the start and end of this show. Polish up the
[48:13.880 --> 48:18.440]  video a little bit. Yeah. They like the sparkly stuff. Big shout out to everybody who gives me
[48:18.440 --> 48:22.760]  comments about the musical selections and the cool shit that I've been trying to do at the start and
[48:22.760 --> 48:27.080]  end of the show. I appreciate that. It's a little bit of work. So I liked that you noticed, um,
[48:27.080 --> 48:31.880]  I gave you your moments. Uh, you got any final things to add to this show? Number 700 bro,
[48:31.880 --> 48:37.240]  before we start wrapping it up. Um, just again, the show's been looking and sounding great. The,
[48:37.240 --> 48:42.120]  the investments you're making in the tech are paying off the hours you spent learning to edit
[48:42.120 --> 48:47.720]  the video or paying off. Um, I'm digging the music in and out, but I missed the original.
[48:48.680 --> 48:53.320]  Like, uh, the mystic roots song. Yeah. I missed that too, but I'm tired of getting flagged by
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.960]  YouTube every time I use it. Mystic roots and I, I know why it's not a thing, but like,
[48:58.760 --> 49:03.000]  every time I go to click on an episode, there's a little piece of my brain that goes, play the song,
[49:03.000 --> 49:09.240]  play the song. I hope it's not the song. Then I get excited to hear what's in the place of it.
[49:09.240 --> 49:13.160]  Okay. Cause it changes all the time now. Yeah. I try to rotate. I've got a few songs that are
[49:13.160 --> 49:18.440]  about 22 seconds, 18 to 22 seconds that fit the intros, try to play those little clips and things.
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.520]  A big shout out to the people that send me music, make music. Sometimes I make a lot of those
[49:22.520 --> 49:26.680]  myself. I'm not trying to toot any horns, but, uh, yeah, thank you, bro. I appreciate it. I can't
[49:26.680 --> 49:31.000]  play the mystic roots song. There are friends of mine. I've got like express written permission
[49:31.000 --> 49:35.160]  and YouTube does not give a shit. YouTube's like, we don't care that they give you permission.
[49:35.160 --> 49:39.400]  Yeah. That doesn't matter. The record label has given me permission and YouTube just does not
[49:39.400 --> 49:44.120]  care. Um, it's kind of funny. I'm like, Hey, look, coot. They're giving me a warning for using your
[49:44.120 --> 49:48.440]  music. And he's like, sorry, bro. There's nothing he can do about it. Sitting across the room from
[49:48.440 --> 49:53.800]  me. It just doesn't matter. Right. Weird music industry stuff. All right. We are, I am rambling.
[49:53.800 --> 49:57.560]  I don't know about you. You look like you've had enough of podcasting today. So it's time to wrap
[49:57.560 --> 50:02.040]  up this show. Make sure you guys follow Mike, send him thanks and love for being on this episode.
