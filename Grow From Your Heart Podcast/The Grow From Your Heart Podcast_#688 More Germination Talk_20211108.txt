[00:03.260 --> 00:19.280]  Yeah, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:19.280 --> 00:25.920]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 688 of the Grow From Your
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.600]  Heart Podcast.
[00:27.600 --> 00:32.800]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on a Patreon question that asks about starting our seeds.
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.120]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:36.120 --> 00:40.380]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.

[02:24.880 --> 02:29.520]  My next order of business is to send a big thank you to everybody who sent me positive
[02:29.520 --> 02:33.760]  feedback and constructive criticism on the previous episode.
[02:33.760 --> 02:36.880]  Of course, the previous episode was about germinating seeds.
[02:36.880 --> 02:42.200]  I did get a lot of comments, a lot of messages, and a lot of feedback about that show.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.200]  Thank you.
[02:43.200 --> 02:47.480]  I did start that podcast off by saying that that was how I germinate my seeds.
[02:47.480 --> 02:52.120]  That is exactly how I start my seeds for my personal grow or for a commercial grow and
[02:52.120 --> 02:54.340]  I have great success with that.
[02:55.120 --> 02:58.140]  Many people told me that they do it quite differently and that is wonderful.
[02:58.140 --> 03:02.300]  I have no problems, no complaints, no issues with you germinating seeds.
[03:02.300 --> 03:03.900]  However, it works for you.
[03:03.900 --> 03:06.620]  That's one of my favorite parts about growing cannabis.
[03:06.620 --> 03:08.900]  There are a lot of ways of doing it.
[03:08.900 --> 03:13.300]  There are a lot of methods, techniques, and styles and they all work if they work.
[03:13.300 --> 03:16.820]  You are doing it correctly if you are satisfied with your outcome.
[03:16.820 --> 03:21.060]  A lot of people wanted to give me feedback and input on how to germinate and I agree
[03:21.060 --> 03:22.060]  with you.
[03:22.060 --> 03:24.940]  I agree that those methods and techniques and tactics will work for you.
[03:24.940 --> 03:29.100]  There's a lot of great ideas in some of the messages I got, but I was just telling you
[03:29.100 --> 03:32.460]  how I do it and if you do it differently, do it your way.
[03:32.460 --> 03:33.460]  Don't let me sway you.
[03:33.460 --> 03:34.880]  Don't let me change your ways.
[03:34.880 --> 03:35.880]  Do that.
[03:35.880 --> 03:36.880]  Do what works for you.
[03:36.880 --> 03:40.960]  I do want to go over some of the ideas and things that people did mention that I did
[03:40.960 --> 03:42.860]  not talk about on the show.
[03:42.860 --> 03:48.220]  When people are germinating seeds, a lot of the time they will soak their seeds for 12
[03:48.220 --> 03:53.340]  to 24 hours in water before even putting them in the paper towel like I showed.
[03:53.340 --> 03:54.340]  That works.
[03:54.340 --> 03:55.340]  That's a great idea.
[03:55.340 --> 03:56.340]  That is a great method.
[03:56.340 --> 04:00.600]  Sometimes if you've got seeds that have a thicker shell or a thicker hole or grew for
[04:00.600 --> 04:02.780]  too long, that will help them germinate.
[04:02.780 --> 04:06.980]  That will soften up the seed before you stick it in the paper towel and get it going.
[04:06.980 --> 04:12.100]  Many people will do a 12 to 24 hour soak on their seeds before they do germinate them.
[04:12.100 --> 04:16.540]  That is just filling up a container, maybe a shot glass, maybe a beer glass with water,
[04:16.540 --> 04:18.460]  just dropping the seeds right in the water.
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.660]  Let them swim around for 24 hours.
[04:20.660 --> 04:24.100]  Then do the germination method which I showed.
[04:24.100 --> 04:30.020]  Also a lot of people do add peroxide to that mix when they are doing the soak and the germination.
[04:30.020 --> 04:33.300]  They'll put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in the mix.
[04:33.300 --> 04:39.180]  Their idea is to get rid of any problems, any bacteria, any problem that may be on that
[04:39.180 --> 04:40.180]  seed.
[04:40.180 --> 04:44.660]  A lot of other growers will add microbes and add things to that.
[04:44.780 --> 04:46.740]  That is a controversial topic.
[04:46.740 --> 04:48.780]  Do peroxide or add microbes.
[04:48.780 --> 04:54.560]  Whichever way works for you, do it because I have seen great success with both methods.
[04:54.560 --> 04:59.980]  As you saw in my germination lesson, I do not use any hydrogen peroxide in my mix.
[04:59.980 --> 05:03.860]  I also do not do the 12 to 24 hour soak for my seeds.
[05:03.860 --> 05:05.680]  I don't find it necessary.
[05:05.680 --> 05:09.120]  If you do that and it works for you, keep doing it.
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.820]  Another thing that a lot of growers will do, a moment ago I mentioned soaking our seeds
[05:12.820 --> 05:14.540]  to soften the shell.
[05:15.420 --> 05:19.820]  Some seeds grow, if they are grown for too long and not harvested on time, the shells
[05:19.820 --> 05:20.900]  will become thick.
[05:20.900 --> 05:22.580]  Those seeds will get too hard.
[05:22.580 --> 05:27.900]  A lot of people will take something and scuff the outer layer of that seed shell.
[05:27.900 --> 05:30.460]  I've seen a lot of different methods for doing this.
[05:30.460 --> 05:35.340]  Some people will simply get a fine grain sandpaper and just rub the seed just a little bit.
[05:35.340 --> 05:38.420]  You don't want to penetrate or puncture or break open the seed.
[05:38.420 --> 05:42.300]  You just want to scuff that outer layer to make it a little bit softer so that the moisture
[05:42.300 --> 05:46.460]  can penetrate that seed and give it the indicator to pop open.
[05:46.460 --> 05:49.880]  That's another thing that people do that I honestly do not do.
[05:49.880 --> 05:53.740]  Maybe if the seeds were really old or something like that, I would do that.
[05:53.740 --> 06:00.060]  Speaking of old seeds, I do not do the peroxide method because I like to promote beneficial
[06:00.060 --> 06:01.760]  bacteria and fungus.
[06:01.760 --> 06:05.600]  If I'm starting some older seeds that I know have been sitting around or if I got them
[06:05.600 --> 06:09.020]  from somebody and I don't know the health of those seeds or the age of those seeds,
[06:09.020 --> 06:13.780]  I may treat them with a microbial product during germination.
[06:13.780 --> 06:18.240]  Something like herb or some kind of microbes just to give them a head start may be the
[06:18.240 --> 06:20.780]  case for older seeds.
[06:20.780 --> 06:23.700]  But in most cases, I don't do any fancy tricks or techniques.
[06:23.700 --> 06:27.440]  I honestly just fold up the paper towel, wet it, and get the seeds going.
[06:27.440 --> 06:29.660]  If that is not how you do it, that is fine.
[06:29.660 --> 06:32.300]  If your method works for you, keep doing your method.
[06:32.300 --> 06:34.700]  I do not disrespect or doubt your method.
[06:34.700 --> 06:37.820]  I'm just telling you how I do things and what works for me.
[06:37.820 --> 06:40.100]  Again, there's no one way to do this.
[06:40.100 --> 06:45.940]  As long as the plants are successful and you're happy with it, you are doing it correctly.
[06:45.940 --> 06:49.820]  One comment and one piece of feedback I was getting from a lot of growers is that they
[06:49.820 --> 06:54.280]  do not even bother doing the soak and the paper towel method.
[06:54.280 --> 06:57.900]  They put their seeds straight into their dirt, straight into their cocoa.
[06:57.900 --> 07:02.180]  They begin watering and they start their seeds right in the pot in which the plant is going
[07:02.180 --> 07:03.380]  to grow.
[07:03.380 --> 07:04.380]  That works.
[07:04.380 --> 07:06.860]  Like I said before, if that works for you, that works for you.
[07:06.900 --> 07:07.900]  I do not do that.
[07:07.900 --> 07:13.020]  There are a few reasons why I don't start my seeds directly in the container.
[07:13.020 --> 07:17.200]  First of all, as a breeder, as the person making the seeds, I like to observe a little
[07:17.200 --> 07:18.200]  bit more.
[07:18.200 --> 07:21.580]  I can pay attention to, I can put a handful of seeds in the paper towel.
[07:21.580 --> 07:22.580]  I can count them.
[07:22.580 --> 07:28.060]  I can open it up however many hours I want and I can see that at six hours, two of them
[07:28.060 --> 07:29.060]  popped.
[07:29.060 --> 07:30.460]  At 12 hours, four of them popped.
[07:30.460 --> 07:32.980]  At 18 hours, I've got six of them popping.
[07:32.980 --> 07:35.420]  I can see that in 24 hours, this many popped.
[07:35.420 --> 07:37.060]  It gives me, I can see them better.
[07:37.060 --> 07:39.860]  If they're in the soil and the dirt, I can't monitor them as well.
[07:39.860 --> 07:41.300]  I can't see the progress.
[07:41.300 --> 07:42.540]  I can't see what's going on.
[07:42.540 --> 07:44.380]  It is a breeder who's making the seeds.
[07:44.380 --> 07:45.380]  I like to see them.
[07:45.380 --> 07:49.140]  I like to see the growth, the development, the time and the speed.
[07:49.140 --> 07:52.300]  All right, I took a quick drink and fixed my voice.
[07:52.300 --> 07:56.540]  Let's talk about a couple of more reasons why I do not pop my seeds directly into the
[07:56.540 --> 07:58.660]  soil in my container.
[07:58.660 --> 08:01.700]  First of all, seed direction.
[08:01.700 --> 08:05.660]  Once my seed is germinated and I've got a little tail coming out, I know which direction
[08:05.660 --> 08:07.340]  that seed is going to be going.
[08:07.340 --> 08:09.620]  I know which way is up and which way is down.
[08:09.620 --> 08:14.180]  I can set that seed in the dirt or in the cocoa and have it set perfectly the direction
[08:14.180 --> 08:17.780]  it needs to go and it is set up for success.
[08:17.780 --> 08:21.620]  If I just throw it right into the dirt and I don't give it any direction, I'm not sure
[08:21.620 --> 08:22.980]  which direction it's facing.
[08:22.980 --> 08:24.380]  It's got to pop the root.
[08:24.380 --> 08:25.940]  The root may go up as it pops.
[08:25.940 --> 08:28.400]  It's got to reorientate itself and go down.
[08:28.400 --> 08:31.500]  The seed needs to figure out which way is down and which way is up.
[08:32.300 --> 08:33.500]  That's slowing me down, wasting time and energy.
[08:33.500 --> 08:37.460]  If I put it in there going up and down, it's already set up for success.
[08:37.460 --> 08:39.280]  It already knows which way to go.
[08:39.280 --> 08:41.300]  We can save a little struggle.
[08:41.300 --> 08:44.700]  Another reason why I don't like to plant the seeds directly into the cocoa or into the
[08:44.700 --> 08:50.700]  dirt is because I like to have better control of the moisture level in the early stages
[08:50.700 --> 08:52.260]  of my seedlings.
[08:52.260 --> 08:57.060]  I know that if I put that seedling in a baggie and a paper towel, that moisture is trapped
[08:57.060 --> 08:58.060]  there.
[08:58.060 --> 08:59.060]  It is not going anywhere.
[08:59.060 --> 09:00.680]  I'm a busy person.
[09:00.860 --> 09:04.400]  Sometimes I will go to a grow thinking I need to be at the grow for an hour and I will be
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.000]  gone for six hours.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.800]  If I wasn't prepared with my plants properly, I would come home and we would have dry, dead
[09:10.800 --> 09:11.800]  seedlings.
[09:11.800 --> 09:17.240]  To set myself up for success, I put them in the baggie where I can retain that moisture.
[09:17.240 --> 09:19.680]  Cocoa dries, soil dries.
[09:19.680 --> 09:23.560]  If there's air movement in the room, if there's wind, if there's a temperature change, that
[09:23.560 --> 09:25.400]  stuff will dry out more quickly.
[09:25.480 --> 09:31.320]  I know that I can control and predict the drying rate of that sealed baggie with the
[09:31.320 --> 09:33.560]  paper towel and the moisture in there.
[09:33.560 --> 09:37.480]  As long as I continue to keep that baggie sealed with the wet paper towel in there,
[09:37.480 --> 09:39.240]  that moisture is not going anywhere.
[09:39.240 --> 09:45.400]  As long as I keep that in a warm place, that seed will germinate and they will be successful.
[09:45.400 --> 09:47.680]  That is part of why I don't go straight to the pot.
[09:47.680 --> 09:52.640]  I think we give ourselves a lot of opportunity to over or underwater our seedlings when we
[09:52.640 --> 09:54.080]  go straight to the pot.
[09:54.080 --> 09:56.320]  We just cause them a lot of unnecessary stress.
[09:56.320 --> 10:01.480]  If I've got a moistened container, a moistened bed of soil and drop the seed directly into
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.760]  there, once it's germinated, I feel like I'm just setting myself up for success.
[10:05.760 --> 10:07.560]  The seeds are expensive.
[10:07.560 --> 10:10.440]  I pride myself on making my seeds affordable.
[10:10.440 --> 10:12.640]  I have very competitive prices.
[10:12.640 --> 10:16.480]  You'll notice we are a little bit lower priced than a lot of the other brands on the same
[10:16.480 --> 10:17.480]  websites.
[10:17.480 --> 10:19.360]  I understand how expensive seeds are.
[10:19.360 --> 10:22.240]  I want to make sure that every single seed germinates.
[10:22.240 --> 10:25.000]  I buy seeds from other breeders and other vendors as well.
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.400]  I pay for those seeds just like you guys do.
[10:27.400 --> 10:29.520]  I want success just like you do.
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.320]  So I do everything that I can to ensure that success.
[10:33.320 --> 10:35.320]  So that is a quick update on germinating seeds.
[10:35.320 --> 10:39.040]  A couple of other options of things you can do and things you might not do.
[10:39.040 --> 10:42.120]  Things that I don't do, but things that are available to you.
[10:42.120 --> 10:45.000]  We started off with a 12 to 24 hour soak.
[10:45.000 --> 10:50.540]  We also added a little bit of peroxide to that water to get rid of any pathogens that
[10:50.540 --> 10:52.120]  may be present.
[10:52.120 --> 10:55.760]  We've also done a little bit of scuffing on our seeds to open up the shells.
[10:55.760 --> 11:00.800]  And then some people may be planting directly into their medium, which is not what I do.
[11:00.800 --> 11:03.920]  But if you want to do that and it works, go for it.
[11:03.920 --> 11:04.920]  Have fun.
[11:04.920 --> 11:07.800]  Like I said, that's one of the best parts of growing cannabis.
[11:07.800 --> 11:11.440]  As long as you are happy with the outcome, as long as you're getting the results you
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.660]  are looking for, you can do it however you want.
[11:14.660 --> 11:15.660]  Have fun.
[11:15.660 --> 11:16.660]  Grow from your heart.
[11:16.660 --> 11:17.660]  Breed with love.
[11:17.660 --> 11:18.660]  Enjoy the garden.
[11:18.660 --> 11:20.200]  Make that garden your Zen space.
[11:20.200 --> 11:21.200]  Do it however you want.
[11:21.280 --> 11:25.640]  Again, I'm just trying to share my knowledge, my info, and the ways that I've had the best
[11:25.640 --> 11:26.640]  success.
[11:26.640 --> 11:29.240]  Now this does segue me into a question.
[11:29.240 --> 11:30.920]  We have a Patreon question.
[11:30.920 --> 11:35.880]  This one came from our friend Maverick, and it basically says, I started a 10 pack of
[11:35.880 --> 11:36.880]  seeds.
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.160]  I did receive three bonus seeds.
[11:38.160 --> 11:39.160]  You're very welcome.
[11:39.160 --> 11:40.160]  Thank you for noticing.
[11:40.160 --> 11:44.320]  It says, I popped the seeds in order to do a pheno hunt for some proper smoke and a possible
[11:44.320 --> 11:45.600]  breeding project.
[11:45.600 --> 11:47.400]  I like where this is going.
[11:47.400 --> 11:53.440]  It says, I started the seeds in a cup of distilled water, pH did 6.0 for 24 hours.
[11:53.440 --> 11:55.160]  We're off to a good start here.
[11:55.160 --> 11:58.720]  It says, then into a paper towel for another 24 hours.
[11:58.720 --> 12:00.440]  Making sense so far.
[12:00.440 --> 12:05.000]  At this point, eight seeds have germinated and a few have tails.
[12:05.000 --> 12:10.280]  Using beer cups filled with Sunshine Mix No. 4, amended with a bit of kelp meal and worm
[12:10.280 --> 12:14.680]  castings, I planted the seeds the depth of a pen tip, the part that holds the ink tube
[12:14.680 --> 12:15.680]  to the ball point.
[12:15.680 --> 12:16.680]  Yes, I know what you mean.
[12:16.960 --> 12:20.200]  It holds the tube of the pen and there's that little, just the writing part where it starts
[12:20.200 --> 12:21.380]  to taper.
[12:21.380 --> 12:22.760]  That sounds like about the right depth.
[12:22.760 --> 12:24.760]  That is knuckle deep if you compare that.
[12:24.760 --> 12:28.280]  It says, I lightly covered and moistened with a few drops of water.
[12:28.280 --> 12:31.120]  I covered the cups with clear beer cups.
[12:31.120 --> 12:32.120]  All right.
[12:32.120 --> 12:33.460]  I like most of this so far.
[12:33.460 --> 12:37.340]  The only thing I would have done differently, I think at this point, is I would not have
[12:37.340 --> 12:40.440]  covered the cups with beer cups.
[12:40.440 --> 12:42.800]  I think I talked about that in the previous episode.
[12:42.800 --> 12:45.120]  I want those seedlings to get air.
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.960]  I want them to get maybe even put a fan on them so they get blown around.
[12:48.960 --> 12:52.740]  The reason we cover clones is to keep the moisture in there.
[12:52.740 --> 12:54.840]  We don't need to cover the seedlings.
[12:54.840 --> 12:56.400]  They're creating a root zone.
[12:56.400 --> 12:58.180]  That is where they're going to eat and drink.
[12:58.180 --> 13:02.760]  The reason we create the humidity environment is because clones don't have roots.
[13:02.760 --> 13:06.040]  In my opinion, the cup on top is unnecessary.
[13:06.040 --> 13:09.080]  However, if it is working for you, don't change it.
[13:09.080 --> 13:10.120]  Do your thing.
[13:10.120 --> 13:12.820]  That's the beauty of growing cannabis in our own gardens.
[13:12.820 --> 13:13.820]  It does go on though.
[13:13.820 --> 13:16.860]  It says, three days later, I have two that have sprouted.
[13:16.860 --> 13:18.020]  You've got some that have popped up.
[13:18.020 --> 13:19.780]  That's always a great feeling.
[13:19.780 --> 13:23.940]  Day four, I get another sprout and I lightly water sprouts and add a few more drops to
[13:23.940 --> 13:24.940]  the empty cups.
[13:24.940 --> 13:25.940]  All right.
[13:25.940 --> 13:26.940]  It's starting to dry.
[13:26.940 --> 13:27.940]  You're adding some water as they're growing.
[13:27.940 --> 13:31.540]  On day eight, I have a total of six seedlings.
[13:31.540 --> 13:32.540]  Okay.
[13:32.540 --> 13:36.580]  You've got six out of either 10 or 13 that you germinated.
[13:36.580 --> 13:38.300]  I don't know how many you did.
[13:38.300 --> 13:40.500]  Got a pack of 10, got 13 seeds.
[13:40.500 --> 13:43.100]  Either way, you've got six total seedlings.
[13:43.100 --> 13:47.140]  Which is 50%, which honestly, as the breeder, I would hope for more.
[13:47.140 --> 13:48.140]  You paid for those seeds.
[13:48.140 --> 13:51.580]  I would hope that you get more than 50% success out of those.
[13:51.580 --> 13:58.880]  It says, upon some excavation, I found twisted tap roots and unsprung seeds that just crunched
[13:58.880 --> 14:01.300]  and mushed at the same time.
[14:01.300 --> 14:03.740]  Then the question here is, did I do something wrong?
[14:03.740 --> 14:08.680]  I made sure the pointy end was down and all the tap roots were down as well.
[14:08.680 --> 14:13.960]  From looking at the picture, my first instinct is that this plant has been too wet for too
[14:13.960 --> 14:14.960]  long.
[14:14.960 --> 14:20.280]  Now it says you've only been giving it a little bit of water, but it looks too wet in my opinion.
[14:20.280 --> 14:23.160]  The seedling itself looks a little damaged.
[14:23.160 --> 14:24.160]  It's just funky.
[14:24.160 --> 14:25.960]  It's just been abused by water.
[14:25.960 --> 14:28.240]  It's been sitting in water for too long.
[14:28.240 --> 14:30.600]  It honestly is getting a little bit of rot.
[14:30.600 --> 14:36.480]  Also, if you look at one section, I see what I think is the end of the tap root popping
[14:36.480 --> 14:38.400]  back up out of the soil.
[14:38.600 --> 14:42.840]  It looks like it completely made a loop and it is coming back up out of the soil, which
[14:42.840 --> 14:45.000]  I'm not sure why that happened.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.000]  Maybe the seedling wasn't pointing the right direction, but something caused that tap root
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.960]  to pop right back up out of the soil.
[14:50.960 --> 14:53.320]  If you look carefully, I think that's what I'm seeing.
[14:53.320 --> 14:56.600]  I will circle that part in the video so that we can see that.
[14:56.600 --> 15:00.000]  But I really do think that that is the end of the tap root popping back up out of the
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  soil.
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.800]  It has curled on itself somehow, which tells me a couple of things.
[15:04.800 --> 15:07.000]  Again, that tells me that it could be too wet.
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.760]  Also, I think it may be too cold.
[15:09.760 --> 15:14.840]  It's hard to judge heat and cold by photos, but by looking at this soil, if that clump
[15:14.840 --> 15:20.040]  of dirt has been that wet for too long, there is an extreme temperature happening in there.
[15:20.040 --> 15:22.480]  It is probably too cold or too warm.
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.240]  If it's too cold, it is definitely going to slow down all progress of those seeds.
[15:27.240 --> 15:32.320]  If it's too hot, it is going to speed up the rot and the mildew process for that seed.
[15:32.320 --> 15:34.440]  I can't tell the temperature by looking at it.
[15:34.560 --> 15:38.520]  I do have a few notes here, but those notes of the temperature are going to be the ambient
[15:38.520 --> 15:39.520]  air temp in the room.
[15:39.520 --> 15:43.520]  I don't know the temperature of the soil inside that cup.
[15:43.520 --> 15:47.480]  It could be really cold, especially if it's sitting on a cold floor.
[15:47.480 --> 15:52.160]  So it could be too cold and too wet, which would be detrimental to a young seedling.
[15:52.160 --> 15:55.320]  The other thing I think about is how tightly is that soil packed?
[15:55.320 --> 15:57.320]  Is that soil stuffed in there?
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.840]  Is it kind of fluffy in there?
[15:58.840 --> 16:02.280]  If it's too tight, that seedling has been struggling to grow its entire life.
[16:02.280 --> 16:05.720]  You said you've grown a lot of seeds and you've done this before, so you probably didn't
[16:05.720 --> 16:06.720]  pack it too tight.
[16:06.720 --> 16:08.720]  I'm going to trust your judgment on that.
[16:08.720 --> 16:11.800]  And also, I'm not making any accusations or pointing any fingers.
[16:11.800 --> 16:15.360]  I'm trying to give you ideas and guidance on what this could be.
[16:15.360 --> 16:17.080]  So don't think I'm judging you.
[16:17.080 --> 16:21.640]  I'm just noticing what I'm seeing in this picture and kind of going by this one picture
[16:21.640 --> 16:24.600]  and this one seedling, which I've got here.
[16:24.600 --> 16:26.160]  How tightly is that soil packed?
[16:26.160 --> 16:27.840]  Is there enough perlite or persolite in there?
[16:27.840 --> 16:29.760]  I do see the white stuff in there.
[16:29.760 --> 16:32.240]  I'm not sure how much is in the entire container.
[16:32.240 --> 16:36.080]  A lot of times the perlite does float, so it's hard to tell how much is in there.
[16:36.080 --> 16:37.480]  Is there airspace in there?
[16:37.480 --> 16:38.480]  That's what I want to know.
[16:38.480 --> 16:39.560]  Do you have some airspace?
[16:39.560 --> 16:43.680]  So when roots do start to grow, are you not going to suffocate that little seedling?
[16:43.680 --> 16:47.360]  The next thing I want to know is, are there drainage holes in that cup?
[16:47.360 --> 16:48.880]  You're using a beer cup.
[16:48.880 --> 16:51.060]  Beer cups do not come with holes in them.
[16:51.060 --> 16:54.520]  You didn't say that you did, and you also didn't say that you did not put any drainage
[16:54.520 --> 16:55.880]  holes in that cup.
[16:55.880 --> 16:57.120]  You've been watering it.
[16:57.120 --> 16:58.960]  Is that water going anywhere?
[16:58.960 --> 17:00.360]  Or is it just evaporating?
[17:00.360 --> 17:03.160]  Or is it making a mud hole inside that cup?
[17:03.160 --> 17:06.840]  If it doesn't, and again, if you're an experienced grower, I hope you did put the holes in there.
[17:06.840 --> 17:08.040]  Maybe it's something you overlooked.
[17:08.040 --> 17:09.500]  Maybe you didn't even think about it.
[17:09.500 --> 17:11.420]  Is there any drainage in that container?
[17:11.420 --> 17:16.840]  Because it does, again, look like it's been too wet and or too cold for too long.
[17:16.840 --> 17:20.860]  So with the details from the letter and the photo that I've got, I think my diagnosis
[17:20.860 --> 17:24.440]  is that this plant has been too wet for too long.
[17:24.440 --> 17:26.080]  It's possibly cold as well.
[17:26.080 --> 17:32.920]  I think the solution would be to water less often and possibly water less water each watering.
[17:32.920 --> 17:37.040]  And again, make sure that you do have proper draining in that container because it looks
[17:37.040 --> 17:38.400]  like there's a lot of water in there.
[17:38.400 --> 17:41.040]  It does look like it's been soaked for quite a while.
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.560]  That ceiling just has that wrinkled, pruney, been in the bathtub too long vibe going on
[17:45.560 --> 17:46.560]  in the photo.
[17:46.560 --> 17:47.560]  That's what I think.
[17:47.560 --> 17:50.480]  So that makes me think too wet, too cold, too long.
[17:50.480 --> 17:56.060]  Now I do have one more completely logical and rational reason for why your seeds may
[17:56.060 --> 17:57.720]  not be germinating.
[17:57.720 --> 18:01.860]  This may not be your problem or your fault or your issue at all.
[18:01.860 --> 18:04.160]  Those seeds simply could be duds.
[18:04.160 --> 18:05.960]  Those seeds simply could be old.
[18:05.960 --> 18:08.840]  Those simply could be non-viable seeds.
[18:08.840 --> 18:10.600]  Those seeds did come from me.
[18:10.600 --> 18:14.000]  I do pride myself on having quality products.
[18:14.000 --> 18:17.800]  I do thoroughly test everything before we release anything.
[18:17.800 --> 18:22.340]  I have not had a lot of negative feedback about the line you were working with, but
[18:22.340 --> 18:25.000]  sometimes seeds do pass through that are not good.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.720]  I obviously can't test every single seed because I've got to send some to you.
[18:29.720 --> 18:34.160]  So this is a customer service issue, possibly on my end.
[18:34.160 --> 18:39.440]  If you feel like these seeds didn't germinate because of my fault to no fault of your own,
[18:39.440 --> 18:44.480]  please send me an email and I would love to send you a replacement pack of seeds.
[18:44.480 --> 18:45.640]  Maybe you got old seeds.
[18:45.640 --> 18:48.680]  Maybe those were sitting around at a vendor for a long time.
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.240]  Maybe you just got the random unviable seeds out of that whole batch.
[18:52.240 --> 18:55.600]  Maybe there were six seeds in there that weren't good and you happened to get them.
[18:55.600 --> 18:59.840]  Either way, I would be happy to send you a replacement pack of seeds that I know are
[18:59.840 --> 19:01.840]  more fresh and are quality.
[19:01.840 --> 19:06.420]  So please do feel free to reach out, send me a follow-up, and we will get you a replacement
[19:06.420 --> 19:07.600]  pack of seeds.
[19:07.600 --> 19:12.640]  And then I do look forward to that germination report and that grow report as well.
[19:12.640 --> 19:17.880]  So once again, to wrap this up, I do think that those seeds were too wet for too long
[19:17.880 --> 19:19.200]  is my diagnosis.
[19:19.200 --> 19:21.800]  However, it could have been a breeder issue.
[19:21.800 --> 19:25.000]  And if you feel like you were owed some seeds, don't be shy.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  Send me an email.
[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  I would be honored and excited to send you a replacement pack.
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers,
[19:33.280 --> 19:37.520]  growers, clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out
