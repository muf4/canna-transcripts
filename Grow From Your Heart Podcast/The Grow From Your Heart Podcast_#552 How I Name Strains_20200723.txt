[01:04.900 --> 01:10.260]  what I'm smoking today. I've been taking dabs of headbanger live batter from green
[01:10.260 --> 01:16.260]  dot labs. This is a blend of sour diesel IBL and biker kush on the package. The flavor
[01:16.260 --> 01:20.900]  is described as sour and fuel. We're going to show that to the camera. It is a beautiful
[01:20.900 --> 01:27.040]  glob of beautiful bright yellow, shiny, tasty, delicious batter. It looks like some cheesecake
[01:27.040 --> 01:30.780]  or maybe a big chunk of thick butter there in the container. That's a nice four gram
[01:31.780 --> 01:37.140]  a gram and a half out of that so far. I really enjoy the headbanger live batter. It's obviously
[01:37.140 --> 01:43.540]  got me nice and rambly. The smell is tremendous. The flavor is perfect. And the buzz is perfect
[01:43.540 --> 01:49.540]  for a podcast. So big shout out to our friends at green dot labs for the delicious headbanger
[01:49.540 --> 01:55.660]  live batter. All right, in this episode, I'm going to talk a little bit about how I choose
[01:55.660 --> 02:01.660]  strain names. But before we get there, let's do some shout outs to the 710 club. The 710

[02:54.580 --> 02:58.300]  not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so all you have to
[02:58.300 --> 03:05.180]  do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. All of the information
[03:05.180 --> 03:09.780]  you need to support the show will be right there on the screen. Also, I did include a
[03:09.780 --> 03:15.220]  link in the show notes to make it nice and easy for all of my working and stone friends.
[03:15.220 --> 03:18.660]  All right, I feel like I got through that part of the show without too many stumbles
[03:18.660 --> 03:21.900]  and too many rambles. I'm sure if you're watching the video, you have noticed I've
[03:21.900 --> 03:26.100]  got a little bit of a different setup. I've got different earbuds in today. I've got a
[03:26.100 --> 03:31.300]  lapel mic or a lav mic if you will. I'm experimenting with a little bit of a different setup trying
[03:31.300 --> 03:36.020]  to get this mic dialed in. This is not going to be a grow intensive podcast. There's not
[03:36.020 --> 03:40.340]  going to be a lot of lessons and details. This one's kind of fun. So I was experimenting
[03:40.340 --> 03:44.740]  with new equipment so that if anything doesn't sound perfect, this is not an episode that
[03:44.740 --> 03:49.860]  is super critical. You missed any real detailed lessons or anything. This one is kind of fun.
[03:49.860 --> 03:55.140]  This one is kind of a jump into my brain, kind of an idea of what I do and why my ideas
[03:55.140 --> 03:59.860]  are the way they are. So it's just going to be fun. Nothing super critical here. Before
[03:59.860 --> 04:03.580]  we get there, what else are we going to talk about? Garden updates. I like to keep you
[04:03.580 --> 04:09.340]  guys updated on what is happening in my personal gardens. If you've been following the show,
[04:09.340 --> 04:13.300]  you know that I've been breeding with Jack the Ripper. I was a big fan of Subcool. I
[04:13.300 --> 04:17.220]  learned a lot from Subcool. I like to say I learned a lot of what to do and what not
[04:17.220 --> 04:22.100]  to do from Subcool. He taught me a lot about growing. He taught me a lot about this business.
[04:22.100 --> 04:26.180]  He was way ahead of me in this game. So I learned quite a bit from him. I felt it was
[04:26.180 --> 04:31.540]  my responsibility to breed with his Jack the Ripper. So I found a Jack the Ripper male
[04:31.540 --> 04:36.660]  that is beautiful. He makes beautiful flower clusters. Made a little bit of purple laden
[04:36.660 --> 04:41.940]  flower, giant big top cola, nice branching. He smells like, it smells like trash can and
[04:41.940 --> 04:46.660]  puke. It's got a little sweetness to it. But that male Jack the Ripper has been putting
[04:46.660 --> 04:53.060]  in work in my garden. I have pollinated several select females. I have trickled out a few
[04:53.060 --> 04:57.260]  of the names of the ladies that have been pollinated. Just real quickly, I will say
[04:57.260 --> 05:02.020]  that I did of course pollinate an Arise. So there will be Jack the Ripper to Arise. Actually
[05:02.020 --> 05:06.660]  it's backwards. It's Arise to Jack the Ripper. Always when you're writing down genetics,
[05:06.660 --> 05:11.180]  always list ladies first. Just like most things in life, ladies first. So if you're listing
[05:11.220 --> 05:18.100]  genetics, the female plant, X the male plant. So it'll be Arise cross to Jack the Ripper.
[05:18.100 --> 05:22.100]  What else is in there? There is a Golden Goat. There'll be Golden Goat to Jack the Ripper.
[05:22.100 --> 05:25.660]  There's also a Blueberry Cookies female in there. So there'll be Blueberry Cookies to
[05:25.660 --> 05:30.220]  Jack the Ripper. And I may have also put a Golden Goat in there. Did I already say that?
[05:30.220 --> 05:35.820]  I may have revealed that on a previous episode, but there is a Golden Goat in there as well.
[05:35.820 --> 05:40.700]  Those plants have been very successfully pollinated. That room is loaded up with seeds and I've
[05:40.700 --> 05:46.140]  got to say that the seeds are growing very quickly underneath the Canon LED lights. I'm
[05:46.140 --> 05:50.340]  very happy and impressed and excited with the way the Canons are working for the seed
[05:50.340 --> 05:54.900]  production. The seeds are getting big. They're starting to harden up. I predict I've got
[05:54.900 --> 06:01.460]  somewhere between 14 and 21 days before these seeds are done. Then we can chop them down.
[06:01.460 --> 06:05.660]  Then I let the plants get bone dry. You guys, before I take the seeds out, the plants will
[06:05.660 --> 06:10.980]  be dust. They'll hang for 10 to 14 days. I'll buck the buds into a container. Then
[06:10.980 --> 06:15.300]  I mush the buds up real small into dust. And then I run that dust through a seed sorting
[06:15.300 --> 06:19.260]  machine. It pulls all the seeds out. It puts all the dust in another pile. Then we have
[06:19.260 --> 06:24.500]  got seeds. At that point, I will test the seeds myself. I will germinate some of them.
[06:24.500 --> 06:29.820]  I will grow some of them and see if I am satisfied. Once I have determined that I am or am not
[06:29.820 --> 06:34.580]  satisfied with what these seeds do, then I will consider releasing them to testers. A
[06:34.580 --> 06:39.220]  lot of people are already typing me an email asking how they can be a tester. Chill out.
[06:39.220 --> 06:42.740]  It's not even ready yet. When the time comes, I'll make it known and I'll let you know how
[06:42.740 --> 06:48.700]  to be a tester. Once the seeds are tested by myself and tested by my qualified testers,
[06:48.700 --> 06:52.880]  then we will consider if they pass testing, do they go to the market? Will they be released
[06:52.880 --> 06:57.540]  to the general public? Of course, if they are released, I will let you know. I don't
[06:57.540 --> 07:01.140]  hide things. I like things to be known. Of course, I want them to get out to the market,
[07:01.140 --> 07:06.140]  to the people and get sold. When and if they do make it to the market, I promise you that
[07:06.140 --> 07:10.020]  you will know. That's what is happening in my grow. That's what I am excited about. I
[07:10.020 --> 07:15.060]  have got Jack the Ripper. He has pollinated several select females. Of course, I did put
[07:15.060 --> 07:19.380]  a Jack the Ripper female in there so we can make some Jack F2s. There's going to be a
[07:19.380 --> 07:23.180]  lot of great shit coming out of that room. Pay attention. I'll keep the updates coming
[07:23.180 --> 07:28.600]  and I'll certainly let you know how testing is going. I think I like recording without
[07:28.600 --> 07:31.900]  that microphone in my face. I would have smacked it three times by now and I haven't
[07:31.900 --> 07:36.000]  touched it. I could get used to this as long as this sounds good. I would like your feedback.
[07:36.000 --> 07:39.440]  Since we're a couple of minutes into the show here, you've been listening to me. Does it
[07:39.440 --> 07:44.640]  still sound good? Because it is very important to me that you approve of the sound quality.
[07:44.640 --> 07:48.280]  Quality is very important. I can fix sound quality. The content is going to be similar
[07:48.280 --> 07:52.560]  all the time. The sound quality, we can improve or adjust. Let me know. Do you love it? Do
[07:52.560 --> 07:58.760]  you hate it? Grow from your heart at hotmail.com or send me a tweet on Twitter at GFYH podcast.
[07:58.760 --> 08:02.360]  Let me know how you feel about this mic. If I get a bunch of negative feedback, I'll learn
[08:02.360 --> 08:06.680]  how to use this mic better or I'll honestly switch back to the old mic. Got to make the
[08:06.680 --> 08:12.240]  show sound good. Doing it for you. Shout out. Where are we now? This is the portion of the
[08:12.240 --> 08:18.120]  show where I'm going to talk about how I come up with strain names. If you follow me, you
[08:18.120 --> 08:22.720]  know that I like to put out strains with very creative, unique, and fun names. I put
[08:22.720 --> 08:28.360]  out some strains that I think, I hate to say it, I think that names can make or break a
[08:28.360 --> 08:31.300]  strain. It's like naming a band. I think if Metallica, and you're going to have your own
[08:31.300 --> 08:35.780]  opinion of Metallica, you can argue with me or not, they're one of the best selling fucking
[08:35.780 --> 08:39.580]  bands on the planet. If you love them or hate them, you cannot argue that they have made
[08:39.580 --> 08:45.120]  more fucking money than you. Metallica, if they would have named themselves like fucking
[08:45.120 --> 08:49.760]  special blue, they would have never did what they did. I think Metallica, the name stands
[08:49.760 --> 08:55.280]  out. It's bold. It's got a good logo. I think the name really helped it sell. Unfortunately,
[08:55.280 --> 09:00.600]  naming cannabis strains can really make or break a strain. Some things I've given weird
[09:00.600 --> 09:04.260]  names and they were killer strains and they just didn't go. Also, sometimes I've made
[09:04.260 --> 09:08.600]  amazing crosses and they just don't go anywhere. I don't know why they don't sell. Let me adjust
[09:08.600 --> 09:12.560]  this mic. It has flipped itself over here. There we go. Sometimes the strains just don't
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.240]  sell and it's probably based on the name. I apologize if you heard that unprofessionalism
[09:17.240 --> 09:21.600]  in the microphone movement, but we're going to stay on track here. A strained name can
[09:21.600 --> 09:24.920]  make or break a strain is something that I've learned, but I still try to stick with shit
[09:24.920 --> 09:29.440]  that I love, names that really ring in my head. It's part of putting my personality
[09:29.440 --> 09:34.360]  into my company, my breeding, my work, my project. I selected those parents. I put them
[09:34.360 --> 09:38.720]  on a date. They hooked up. They made babies. I think the name should come from me also.
[09:38.880 --> 09:43.480]  It should come from my heart just like my grow did. I'm rambling, trying to build up
[09:43.480 --> 09:47.800]  hype a little bit here, but let's talk about how I choose strain names. What are things
[09:47.800 --> 09:52.540]  that come to my mind and what are things I think of when I'm making strain names? You'll
[09:52.540 --> 10:00.400]  notice a rise. A rise is a cross of golden goat and daybreaker. Daybreaker came from
[10:00.400 --> 10:07.840]  Gage Green Genetics. Gage Green Genetics had a theme of using one word inspirational
[10:07.840 --> 10:14.200]  type words to name their strains. I wanted to continue that tradition and honor Gage
[10:14.200 --> 10:20.760]  Green Genetics by giving a rise a one word name that felt uplifting and positive and
[10:20.760 --> 10:26.400]  very a powerful word. When you read the word arise, I think of a rise. I'm going to fucking
[10:26.400 --> 10:29.760]  arise. I'm going to get off my chair. I'm going to get off the couch and I'm going to
[10:29.760 --> 10:35.040]  rise up and be the best I can be or there's some sort of uprising or something like that.
[10:35.040 --> 10:40.160]  I really felt that it was a powerful word. When you consume arise, some people really
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.420]  want to take a nap. Some people really want to get up, but what I did notice, it makes
[10:44.420 --> 10:49.600]  people who hurt, it makes your body pains go away and you get up and you feel better.
[10:49.600 --> 10:55.080]  I did not come up with the name arise on my own. I've got to admit that I was asking for
[10:55.080 --> 11:00.760]  strain names on social media for a totally different cross. Somebody said, I like arise
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.880]  as a strain name. I said, that is not the name of this cross. That's the name of another
[11:05.880 --> 11:09.400]  one I'm working on. I knew, I was like, that's golden goat and daybreaker going to be called
[11:09.400 --> 11:15.400]  arise. It was put on a list by somebody else and I matched it up to the appropriate strain.
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.560]  Arise was called arise because I like the way that one word, one syllable, maybe that's
[11:20.560 --> 11:25.840]  to arise. Just a short word, a few short letters, just real powerful and invoking.
[11:25.840 --> 11:30.800]  That's why arise became arise. I wanted to keep with the gauge green tradition of those
[11:30.800 --> 11:38.320]  types of words. Then I also really liked just the feeling of that. That became arise. Then
[11:38.320 --> 11:45.600]  prana was also a cross of the arise. Flow and prana make arise, or no, flow and arise,
[11:45.760 --> 11:51.360]  make prana. I was thinking too many thoughts at once. Flow is the female, arise is the male.
[11:51.360 --> 11:57.760]  I was Googling words that you would find in a yoga class or where that came from. Flow,
[11:57.760 --> 12:03.920]  like the flow, the movement of energy and the upward flow of energy and arise. The word that
[12:03.920 --> 12:08.480]  came out of all my Google searching and talking to girls who do yoga, I did some research there,
[12:08.480 --> 12:14.080]  some recon. I came up with the word prana. That's where my brain was there. I stuck with that
[12:14.080 --> 12:20.240]  one word, short syllable, powerful feeling. It just means something. Also, I obviously like to
[12:20.240 --> 12:26.960]  name stuff after music. I am a huge Grateful Dead fan. I've been a Deadhead since high school,
[12:26.960 --> 12:32.160]  since probably 14 or 15 years old. I love the Grateful Dead, all the stuff the Dead does.
[12:32.160 --> 12:38.160]  You'll notice a lot of my strains have Grateful Dead names or hints or nods to Grateful Dead
[12:38.160 --> 12:44.080]  songs within the name. Of course, Dark Hollow, excuse me, Dark Hollow is a strain I did an
[12:44.080 --> 12:49.040]  episode on last time. That is straight up a Grateful Dead song. That is one of my favorite
[12:49.040 --> 12:54.480]  Grateful Dead songs. It fit the strain very well because it makes big dark leaves. Dark Hollow,
[12:54.480 --> 12:58.800]  beautiful. Scarlet Begonias, that is a Grateful Dead song. Yes, I'm sure you guys heard that
[12:58.800 --> 13:03.200]  other band do it. The Grateful Dead fucking put that one out. That's a Grateful Dead song.
[13:03.200 --> 13:09.840]  Got to name Scarlet Begonias, Scarlet Begonias. Why? Because it has redheaded stranger in there.
[13:09.840 --> 13:16.640]  Redheaded stranger, cross to the arise, the red, Grateful Dead influence, Scarlet Begonias. It was
[13:16.640 --> 13:23.600]  really easy that way. Morning Dew. Morning Dew is a Grateful Dead song. Walk me out in the morning
[13:23.600 --> 13:29.440]  dew. That's a Grateful Dead lyric that's very well known amongst Deadheads. Morning Dew is a cross of
[13:29.440 --> 13:36.880]  Grateful Dog and Arise. What? Grateful Dog. That is a Grateful Dead side project. That was Jerry
[13:36.880 --> 13:43.600]  Garcia and David Grissman's Bluegrass project was Grateful Dog. So Grateful Dog, cross to the arise,
[13:43.600 --> 13:48.160]  became Morning Dew, which is another Grateful Dead song. You guys are seeing my Grateful Dead
[13:48.160 --> 13:52.480]  influence come out now. I think those are the Grateful Dead names that I have used.
[13:53.200 --> 14:02.480]  Reggae artists. There was Bounty Killer. There was Capleton. There was Kalonji. What else was
[14:02.480 --> 14:08.080]  there? Bounty Killer was called Bounty Killer because it put off Giant Harvest, the bounty.
[14:08.080 --> 14:14.000]  It killed the bounty. Also, Bounty Killer is a reggae artist, a Jamaican dance hall reggae artist
[14:14.000 --> 14:19.040]  that is quite aggressive, pretty fucking awesome. Love that vibe. Good shit. So that's where Bounty
[14:19.040 --> 14:26.640]  Killer came from. Capleton. Capleton was a Grateful Dog to White Widow Cross, and Capleton
[14:26.640 --> 14:33.920]  is a reggae artist. That's another reggae artist. Kalonji. Kalonji Kush is named after Sizzla Kalonji.
[14:33.920 --> 14:39.200]  That's Tahoe OG to the Grateful Dog. So I took the Grateful Dog and pollinated a few select females,
[14:39.200 --> 14:46.800]  and they got named after reggae stars. Then here's where I took it even further. I took the Capleton
[14:46.800 --> 14:53.200]  and I pollinated the Capleton with King Solomon, my Arise male, and I called that Sunshine Girl.
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.960]  Why? Because Capleton sings a song called Sunshine Girl. It couldn't get any better than that, right?
[14:58.960 --> 15:08.240]  She's my sunshine girl. Then Kalonji Kush crossed to the Arise, became Liberation. There are a couple
[15:08.240 --> 15:13.680]  reasons I chose the word Liberation. Sometimes you hear Capleton and Kalonji, just yell the words
[15:13.680 --> 15:20.080]  Liberation. Also, Morgan Heritage, one of my favorite reggae bands, has a song called Liberation.
[15:20.080 --> 15:26.320]  So Liberation was on my mind. That word came up a lot. Also, fits with that one word kind of theme
[15:26.320 --> 15:32.640]  sort of a thing. So Liberation OG came up right there. Reggae themes. What else do we have in the
[15:32.640 --> 15:40.480]  reggae themes? Pineapple Wine, you guys. Pineapple Wine is straight up a Morgan Heritage song.
[15:40.480 --> 15:46.800]  Pineapple Wine is cactus cooler, crossed to Arise. When you grow it, it has tropical flavors.
[15:46.800 --> 15:51.680]  It's got a fermented, funky sort of a flavor on the bottom of it. That's the wine part.
[15:51.680 --> 15:57.360]  That tropical fruit flavor is the pineapple. Oh my my, Pineapple Wine. You couldn't go wrong.
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.400]  Look up the Morgan Heritage song, think of Pineapple Wine, smoke some good herbs, some ganja,
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.320]  and you're going to say, that guy nailed that one. That was beautiful. So that's where some of those
[16:06.320 --> 16:13.120]  strain names come. Arise, I told you about Arise. Liberation OG is kalonji to the Arise.
[16:13.120 --> 16:17.920]  I think I was just talking about that. I've lost my place on my notes here. Then I've got
[16:17.920 --> 16:23.200]  things like Blue Raspberry Truffle. Why did I name Blue Raspberry Truffle? Blue Raspberry Truffle.
[16:23.200 --> 16:29.520]  That sounds very unique and creative. Yes, there's a color. When you say colors, colors already start
[16:29.520 --> 16:35.600]  your brain working. Blue. Raspberry. That sounds good. I like Blue Raspberry. And truffles. Truffles
[16:35.600 --> 16:40.480]  are exotic and different. I want some of that. Where does all this nonsense in my name scheme
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.520]  come from? The blue. There's blueberry cookies in there. It smells like blueberries. It smells like
[16:45.520 --> 16:51.600]  blueberry cookies, blueberry muffins, but also raspberry because when I was younger, they used to
[16:51.600 --> 16:55.920]  sell these blue, purple, blue lollipops. You'd suck on them and your whole fucking face would turn
[16:55.920 --> 16:59.760]  blue and purple. Not the outside, the inside of your mouth would turn blue and purple. Your lips
[16:59.760 --> 17:06.080]  and tongue would be completely purple and blue. The buds taste like these lollipops, the
[17:06.080 --> 17:12.480]  Blue Raspberry Lollipops. But also, since there's a little bit of chem dog and Joseph O.G. in there,
[17:12.480 --> 17:20.000]  there's an earthy, dirty, chocolatey taste on the exhale. Blue. Raspberry. Truffle. It feels and
[17:20.000 --> 17:25.360]  sounds so good together. BRT. The Blue Raspberry Truffle. That's where that name came from.
[17:25.360 --> 17:30.160]  Just nice and simple. Also kind of creative. I've got a list of my strain names here in my phone
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.520]  that I'm going to go through and just give you some ideas of how I came up with some of these
[17:33.520 --> 17:38.480]  names before we move too far into this. Blue Raspberry Truffle, I already told you. Morning
[17:38.480 --> 17:44.320]  Dew. Scarlet Begonias and Dark Hollow were all Grateful Dead names. The Cream. The Cream is
[17:44.320 --> 17:50.880]  Cookies and Cream number 13, cross to Arise. The Cream always rises to the top. So it was
[17:50.880 --> 17:55.200]  the Cream. You can't go wrong with that, right? The Cream always rises to the top. Cookies and
[17:55.200 --> 18:03.760]  Cream to Arise. Double Dose. This one pays tribute to the original name of Dosey Dough. Double Dose
[18:03.760 --> 18:10.080]  is Dosey Dough cross to Arise. A Double Dose. If you go to a Grateful Dead show or if you go to a
[18:10.080 --> 18:15.040]  show and somebody asks if you want some acid, I want a Double Dose. So Double Dose. That's where
[18:15.040 --> 18:20.160]  that one came from. I was recently told that there's another strain maker using the word Double
[18:20.160 --> 18:25.840]  Dose. I apologize, dude. I did not know. I googled it. It didn't come up. No beef, no hatred. Let's
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.840]  talk about it. One of us has got to change our name or something, but Double Dose. That's what
[18:29.840 --> 18:35.440]  it's called. What else do we got here? Sonic Boom and Double Dragon. This is leading more into my
[18:35.440 --> 18:42.720]  childhood, more about what I'm into as a youth. Sonic Boom. I should have said Sonic Boom and
[18:42.720 --> 18:48.560]  Dragon Punch, but I skipped one. Sonic Boom and Dragon Punch are both Street Fighter 2 references.
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.760]  Sonic Boom comes from Guile from Street Fighter 2. Hold backwards for two seconds, press forward
[18:53.760 --> 18:59.120]  and any punch button and Guile will throw Sonic Boom. It's a fun game. That's my favorite
[18:59.120 --> 19:04.320]  game. Let me pick Guile. I'll beat anybody. Let's play some Street Fighter 2. That's where Sonic
[19:04.320 --> 19:10.400]  Boom came from. That's Guile's fucking special move. Dragon Punch is Ken and Ryu's special move
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.720]  from Street Fighter 2. He throws a fucking punch with fire on it, goes up into the air and yells,
[19:14.720 --> 19:19.920]  shout out, you can Sonic Boom and Dragon Punch. Dude, paying tribute to my favorite video game as
[19:19.920 --> 19:26.000]  a kid. I spent so much time, so much time at Lee's Market in Bellflower, California, getting
[19:26.560 --> 19:31.440]  schooled on Street Fighter 2. Oh man, shout out to all the people that taught me how to rage on
[19:31.440 --> 19:36.640]  that game. Then I already said it, Double Dragon. Double Dragon. That's also a video game from the
[19:36.640 --> 19:41.200]  80s. I remember hanging out at Robbie Wilson's house. His parents thought we were asleep. We'd
[19:41.200 --> 19:44.880]  have to put fucking towels under the gap in the door so nobody could see the video game light
[19:44.880 --> 19:50.800]  reflected. We would play Double Dragon until the sun came up and then I was smart. Robbie's family
[19:50.800 --> 19:55.200]  was a church family and they would go to church every Sunday. I would stay the night on Saturday
[19:55.200 --> 19:59.200]  with intentions to go to church, but it's weird because every Sunday I didn't feel good and I had
[19:59.200 --> 20:03.200]  to go home. I woke up and had to take a mean shit and didn't feel good at Robbie's house and had to
[20:03.200 --> 20:07.440]  go home right before church. I never went to church with them. Hung out with them for years. I always
[20:07.440 --> 20:12.000]  pulled that scam beautifully. Nobody ever caught on. That was good. I bet they knew I was just a
[20:12.000 --> 20:18.640]  dumbass kid. So that's Double Dragon, Sonic Boom, Dragon Punch, paying homage to video games from my
[20:18.640 --> 20:23.840]  youth. Strawberry Starburst. Why did I call that Strawberry Starburst? Because when you bite into
[20:23.840 --> 20:28.720]  a Strawberry Starburst, it tastes like you're smoking Strawberry Starburst. I know I said that
[20:28.720 --> 20:34.240]  backwards, but that's how it is. Where are we? Sunkiss, obviously. Called Sunkiss, Sunkiss,
[20:34.240 --> 20:38.800]  because it tastes like a fucking Sunkiss orange. You can't go wrong with that. Lemon Sunrise,
[20:38.800 --> 20:45.200]  it's lemony. Starstruck. I want to give credit to Adam Ill, my buddy Adam Ill, named Starstruck. I
[20:45.200 --> 20:50.480]  said, hey bro, I've got a cross called Star Dog to Arise. It needs a name. And he goes, bro, it's
[20:50.480 --> 20:55.200]  called Starstruck because when you smoke that shit, you get starstruck. He's from Hollywood,
[20:55.200 --> 21:00.720]  so that's just how that shit went. I think we're running out. Oh, Storm Shadow, you guys. Storm
[21:00.720 --> 21:06.080]  Shadow. Storm Shadow was a name of a strain that I've created. What is Storm Shadow? Storm Shadow
[21:06.080 --> 21:12.560]  was a GI Joe. Storm Shadow was the silent killer. Storm Shadow was a ninja from GI Joe that wore all
[21:12.560 --> 21:18.080]  white. He was a bad motherfucker. Loved him. One of my favorite GI Joes. Of course, he got a strain
[21:18.640 --> 21:23.600]  named after him. I would really love to name a strain Snake Eyes. Somebody's cooler than me,
[21:23.600 --> 21:27.680]  and they already got it. And I'm not going to rip off a name on purpose, but that's where Storm
[21:27.680 --> 21:34.720]  Shadow came from. It is named after a GI Joe. Now, I'm going to segue into another short story
[21:34.720 --> 21:38.960]  about how I named some strains. Then I'm going to wrap up this episode. I want to thank you guys for
[21:38.960 --> 21:43.760]  hanging out. The next series of strains I want to talk about, I've spoken about this on a podcast
[21:43.760 --> 21:50.080]  before, but it fits beautifully in today's episode, is my TMNT line. That is right. I avoid saying
[21:50.080 --> 21:55.040]  those words altogether, but I have got some crosses that are called Donatello, Leonardo,
[21:55.040 --> 22:02.560]  Raphael, Michelangelo, Bebop, and Rocksteady. And recently, I did release Shredder along with that
[22:02.560 --> 22:07.040]  mix. They are almost sold out. Once they're gone, they will not be made anymore. But let's talk
[22:07.040 --> 22:12.400]  about how those crosses got their names. This will be a deep dive into the way that my brain
[22:12.400 --> 22:18.800]  thinks and works. I had a room that I was pollinating. I wanted to breed with the blueberry
[22:18.800 --> 22:24.160]  cookies. I took the blueberry cookies plant, and I reversed it. And I wanted to put that pollen
[22:24.160 --> 22:29.120]  on several other plants. I had made a few selections. I chose another blueberry cookies
[22:29.120 --> 22:34.560]  because I wanted to make S1s of that plant. That was my initial goal. I was actually asked to do
[22:34.560 --> 22:40.800]  that. So in that process, I put a strawberry fields plant in the room, a female. I also put a platinum
[22:40.800 --> 22:47.280]  tangy female in there. So now, my brain is thinking in colors. My brain is different than a lot of
[22:47.280 --> 22:52.160]  people. I've got a brain injury. I see things differently than a lot of people, which is glorious.
[22:52.160 --> 22:57.600]  But you can see the thing that's developing here. There is strawberry fields in this room.
[22:57.600 --> 23:02.960]  There is platinum tangy in this room. There is blueberry cookies in this room. When I see those
[23:02.960 --> 23:08.400]  plants, when I write the labels in my brain, I see the plant label in color. Blueberry cookies,
[23:08.400 --> 23:14.240]  why isn't that label blue? It is in my brain. It's fucking blue. Platinum tangy, orange, right?
[23:14.240 --> 23:20.320]  Orange is tangy, platinum tangy, orange is in my brain. Strawberry fields, I see orange. There are
[23:20.320 --> 23:24.080]  other plants in this room. I had a lemon skunk in there that doesn't fit the theme, but it worked
[23:24.080 --> 23:30.000]  out. That became Donatello. I had a Durban poison in there that became Rocksteady, and I had an
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.280]  Arise in there. They became Bebop. Later on, I added Golden Goat to the mix, and that became
[23:35.280 --> 23:41.920]  Shredder. Now, let's talk about how the name scheme developed. I was working in a commercial
[23:41.920 --> 23:48.320]  cultivation facility, and we had gotten a whole new delivery of fresh plants. I was thinking of
[23:48.320 --> 23:52.800]  names of these strains throughout the day. That was like my meditation to keep myself entertained.
[23:52.800 --> 23:57.120]  What am I going to call these new crosses? They're almost ready. They need names. Oh, look, we got
[23:57.120 --> 24:01.760]  new plants in. Let's go and unload these and put these in the computer system. As I'm unloading
[24:01.760 --> 24:09.600]  new plants, I came across Lucinda Williams, and as I'm unloading the plants, I also came across
[24:09.600 --> 24:13.840]  Maria Cruz. Those are just names of strains that happened to come into my new facility or the
[24:13.840 --> 24:20.960]  facility I was in that day. At the same time this happened, I'm thinking of new cross names for new
[24:20.960 --> 24:25.440]  strains, and I'm thinking about cartoons. I was like, why don't you name them after some cool
[24:25.440 --> 24:29.760]  cartoon? I'm over there going, spoon, thinking I'm going to name it after the tick or something.
[24:29.760 --> 24:35.840]  I've got all kinds of weird ideas in my head. When I saw Lucinda Williams and I saw Maria Cruz,
[24:35.840 --> 24:42.400]  my brain said, where's April O'Neill? Then it all came to me. I said, oh, shit, April O'Neill,
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.720]  you've got a red one, you've got a blue one, you got an orange one, you've got the fucking Ninja
[24:46.720 --> 24:52.400]  Turtles and the three and the two bad guys. That's how it happened. Strawberry Fields got the red
[24:52.400 --> 24:58.320]  label. That became Raphael. Platinum Tangy with the orange label became Michelangelo. Blueberry
[24:58.320 --> 25:03.440]  Cookies with the blue label became Leonardo. I apologize that there wasn't a purple plant in
[25:03.440 --> 25:09.200]  there, but Lemon Skunk is close enough to be Donatello. Then Rock Steady was Durban Poison,
[25:09.200 --> 25:16.160]  and Bebop was the Arise. The names happened within, once I saw, once it clicked, it was done,
[25:16.160 --> 25:23.760]  set in stone. I came home that evening and I drew the logos. I redesigned the logos.
[25:23.760 --> 25:30.000]  They became the packaging for those packages. I scribbled it on paper, took a picture of it with
[25:30.000 --> 25:34.800]  my phone, sent that to my artist friend, and within five hours, we had all of the designs
[25:34.800 --> 25:39.440]  dialed in, locked in, ready to go. They were being printed out within that fucking week,
[25:39.440 --> 25:44.720]  and they were packaged up and ready for sale. That shit happened so quickly, but that's how
[25:44.720 --> 25:48.880]  they got their names. I was thinking about cartoons I wanted to name the strains after.
[25:49.760 --> 25:54.960]  There were colors, and then I saw Maria Cruz and Lucinda Williams, and I said,
[25:54.960 --> 26:02.000]  where's April O'Neil? When I said April O'Neil, it spiraled into fucking the line that came out
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.960]  and is nearly sold out. That's how that line developed. That's how the name developed. The
[26:06.960 --> 26:11.680]  line developed because another friend wanted the seeds of the blueberry cookies. He lives in another
[26:11.680 --> 26:16.160]  location. We couldn't get him clones, but we can definitely get him seeds, so I made seeds of it.
[26:16.160 --> 26:20.960]  He's got his seeds. He actually got a few of all the crosses just because I'm nice like that.
[26:20.960 --> 26:25.840]  Then I continued with the line and did what I did. Then later on, I introduced Shredder into
[26:25.840 --> 26:30.480]  the mix. I put the golden goat in there, and it all worked beautifully. Those will not be made
[26:30.480 --> 26:34.240]  anymore. You guys, those are discontinued. There are a few packs left. There are a few packs
[26:34.240 --> 26:38.720]  circulating. They're on the vendors and on the websites, but I will not make any more. If you've
[26:38.720 --> 26:45.280]  been looking for them, now's your chance. Get them while they're hot. I would recommend seedsherenow.com.
[26:46.080 --> 26:51.920]  Also, use coupon code GFYH10 at seedsherenow.com. Save yourself 10%. That may cover shipping. If
[26:51.920 --> 26:55.840]  you're buying a few packs, that will add up quite quickly. I need to take a quick drink. You guys,
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.640]  bear with me. I'm using the new microphone today, so I'm not sure how much of that drink you got to
[27:02.640 --> 27:06.720]  hear, but I hope you enjoy it. Hydrate yourselves, guys. It's summertime. We got to take good care of
[27:06.720 --> 27:13.120]  ourselves. All right. I feel like that was my how I name my strains slash how I'm learning to use my
[27:13.120 --> 27:18.320]  lavalier mic episode. I hope I sounded great in this episode. Again, if I didn't sound marvelous,
[27:18.880 --> 27:22.800]  this was just a fun episode. We got to talk a little bit. I got to talk about me, so you didn't
[27:22.800 --> 27:27.360]  miss any grow details, any grow knowledge. This was just some cannabis culture to talk about for
[27:27.360 --> 27:31.360]  the evening. I want to thank you guys for hanging out. I had a lot of fun doing this episode. I hope
[27:31.360 --> 27:36.400]  you enjoyed it as much as I did. If you feel like this episode was educational, informative, and or
