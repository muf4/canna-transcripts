[00:00.250 --> 00:16.930]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff, and it is time
[00:16.930 --> 00:22.410]  for episode 587 of the grow from your heart podcast. If you're watching on YouTube, I'm
[00:22.410 --> 00:26.050]  sure you could tell by now that white Mike is joining me. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:26.050 --> 00:28.370]  What's up, man. Thanks for having me.
[00:28.370 --> 00:31.550]  Dude. Thanks for joining me. You sound, you sound great on the microphone today. Sorry
[00:31.550 --> 00:35.250]  for interrupting you there right at the start of the show. You sound amazing. You look good.
[00:35.250 --> 00:36.570]  Keep it up, bro. Thank you for joining me.
[00:37.050 --> 00:38.650]  Try to stay on the microphone. Yeah, man.
[00:38.650 --> 00:41.970]  You're getting better at it. The audience has noticed they've made a lot of compliments
[00:41.970 --> 00:45.730]  and I found some gear that makes you sound better. So this is going to be a great show.
[00:45.730 --> 00:49.970]  Some setup changes. I think we got it figured out, folks.
[00:49.970 --> 00:54.050]  We're going to get Mike some lighting pretty soon and make him look as sharp as I do also.
[00:54.050 --> 00:57.370]  He doesn't record as much as I do, but we're going to get him up to speed. Anyway, in this
[00:57.370 --> 01:02.370]  episode we're going to talk about edibles, a quite often overlooked subject in the cannabis
[01:02.370 --> 01:06.530]  podcasting realm. We're going to focus on edibles in this episode. Before we get there,
[01:06.530 --> 01:10.410]  let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support us in the 710 club. Of course,

[02:47.290 --> 02:50.970]  That is the truth. Thank you guys. We do appreciate it. I did mention at the start of the show
[02:50.970 --> 02:55.250]  that we're going to talk about edibles. I'm not sure if you noticed during the shout outs,
[02:55.250 --> 02:59.450]  the fucking edibles are working, dude. We usually start the show by talking about what
[02:59.450 --> 03:03.130]  we're smoking. Let's talk about what we have eaten and what we've consumed. Mike, what
[03:03.130 --> 03:08.370]  are you going in on? Yeah. What did you eat this evening, this afternoon before the show?
[03:08.370 --> 03:14.810]  The edible I've been obsessed with lately are these gummy candies made right here in Pueblo.
[03:14.810 --> 03:20.570]  Taste Buds. Those of you on YouTube, I just held it up for the camera. These ones are
[03:20.570 --> 03:28.330]  some blue raspberries, sativa, just 10 milligram gummies. If you're a big guy like me, you
[03:28.330 --> 03:34.770]  care about quality. Ever in Colorado, the quality of the candy you get here was shitty.
[03:34.770 --> 03:35.770]  For a minute, yeah.
[03:35.770 --> 03:39.570]  This was the first company that was like, we're really going to put together a good
[03:39.570 --> 03:43.410]  piece of candy. I was like, that's what I've been waiting for. So I'm going to get what
[03:43.410 --> 03:45.610]  you got. I've been a fan since.
[03:45.610 --> 03:48.330]  Nice. You said those are made here in Pueblo, huh?
[03:48.490 --> 03:49.490]  Yep.
[03:49.490 --> 03:52.090]  That's awesome. I did not know that. So I'm glad you told me about that. That feels good
[03:52.090 --> 03:56.450]  that you're supporting a local product. I don't know where this product was grown or
[03:56.450 --> 04:01.690]  made. I know where I bought it and it was delicious. I ate maybe possibly a little bit
[04:01.690 --> 04:07.250]  too much of a caramel and corn Coda bar. This is cannabis infused chocolate bar, a hundred
[04:07.250 --> 04:13.290]  milligrams of THC and zero milligrams of CBD. I think I've had about 20 or 40. I ate 20
[04:13.290 --> 04:16.970]  milligrams of it earlier as we started the show and I'm going to eat more of it as we
[04:16.970 --> 04:19.770]  start the show. I've had 20. I'm going to eat a little bit more. It's starting to work.
[04:19.770 --> 04:25.250]  I think I'm going to eat up to 40 because I've noticed that lately 50 is right about
[04:25.250 --> 04:28.450]  where I start getting a little bit silly.
[04:28.450 --> 04:33.130]  If I don't dab 50 is cool, but if I eat 50 milligrams and take a dab, dude, then I'm
[04:33.130 --> 04:37.330]  like, Oh, should I need a minute? Like, and that's fun sometimes, but I got shit to do,
[04:37.330 --> 04:40.330]  man. We got to record. I got to edit. I got to do stuff. So I can't think I'm gonna go
[04:40.330 --> 04:43.690]  40 and a couple of dabs and we'll see what that does.
[04:43.690 --> 04:46.930]  That's why I only ate 20 for tonight's show. Cause I knew I was going to be hitting my
[04:46.930 --> 04:53.050]  pen and taking a couple of dabs and I didn't want to get over medicated, which I'll do
[04:53.050 --> 04:54.290]  that with edibles too.
[04:54.290 --> 04:57.730]  Yeah. It's not hard. Not hard. Like, yeah, I'm going to crack this open and make sure
[04:57.730 --> 05:00.930]  that I'm not lying to make sure. Yeah. So I ate 20 and I'm gonna eat 20 more as the
[05:00.930 --> 05:03.290]  show goes on. That's, that's my goal.
[05:03.290 --> 05:08.810]  Yeah. When, when, uh, back in the day when it was a, a cookie your friend made that tasted
[05:08.810 --> 05:15.250]  like feet and something from under the lawnmower. It, uh, it was harder to over consume. Now
[05:15.250 --> 05:16.250]  everything's delicious.
[05:16.250 --> 05:20.770]  Yeah. These chocolate candies are really, really good. It can be dangerous.
[05:20.770 --> 05:25.770]  Yeah. I've, uh, I've gotten myself into a little trouble just enjoying what I purchased.
[05:25.770 --> 05:31.290]  And then, you know, five or six deep, you're like, oops, I'm gonna call and cancel some
[05:31.290 --> 05:32.290]  shit.
[05:32.290 --> 05:35.010]  You said edibles from back in the day that tasted like poop. Remember when they just
[05:35.010 --> 05:38.930]  tasted just like green, green plants? You're like, why does it taste like I'm eating green
[05:38.930 --> 05:43.130]  plants? Like people were just putting weed in the edibles. You guys don't put just weed
[05:43.130 --> 05:47.330]  in your brownie mix, put, make some butter and put the butter or some, just drop some
[05:47.330 --> 05:51.810]  shatter in the brownie mix. Stir that in real good. Put some, put a bunch of distillate
[05:51.810 --> 05:56.250]  in there. Oh yeah. But don't just go put a bunch of weed in there.
[05:56.250 --> 05:57.650]  The recipe calls for.
[05:57.650 --> 06:01.410]  Yeah. Add that. Don't not a bunch of, we're not, we're not horses. We're not cows. We
[06:01.410 --> 06:04.450]  don't need to graze on a bunch of greens like that. I get enough greens in my diet. Let's
[06:04.450 --> 06:07.690]  not eat a bunch of weed. I mean, he can if you want to, but that's, that's not the way
[06:07.690 --> 06:11.970]  I recommend it. So we're going to talk about edibles. I've eaten some edibles. I'm going
[06:11.970 --> 06:16.890]  to eat more. I think a good spot to start with talking about edibles, Mike might be
[06:16.890 --> 06:23.250]  the basic number one thing. Dosage. No, learn your dosage. Maybe people are jumping into
[06:23.250 --> 06:25.910]  edibles for the first time. I'm saying, no, your dosage is like, I don't fucking know
[06:25.910 --> 06:30.030]  my dosage. We can't even get edibles where I am. So learn your dosage. You got to learn
[06:30.030 --> 06:34.470]  your dosage. I used to say, start off with like 10 milligrams. I'm going to say maybe
[06:34.470 --> 06:37.070]  start off with five milligrams.
[06:37.070 --> 06:43.550]  It it all depends on your tolerance level. And when I was working a retail counter as
[06:43.550 --> 06:52.830]  a bud tender edibles, a lot of people would like that. I hadn't smoked in 30 years crowd
[06:52.830 --> 06:59.270]  and I just retired and I want to get back into cannabis. Edibles seem like a softer,
[06:59.270 --> 07:05.230]  I don't have to smoke anything. I protected my lungs type option to get back into cannabis
[07:05.230 --> 07:16.630]  or to dip your toe into the water. And no, it's so, so easy to overdo it when you're
[07:16.630 --> 07:24.150]  eating it and it's delicious. And if you're a non-consumer consuming for the first time
[07:24.150 --> 07:30.230]  at all, it's so, so easy to consume more than will be enjoyable.
[07:30.230 --> 07:37.470]  Yes, absolutely. So I think the joke that Mike and I both made is you can't uneat that
[07:37.470 --> 07:43.830]  second dose when you eat, eat five or 10 milligrams and give it a solid hour before you see what
[07:43.830 --> 07:48.950]  happens. I've eaten the edibles. I probably 40 minutes ago and I'm just now barely starting
[07:48.950 --> 07:53.030]  to feel a kick in and I'm sure in like the next 20 minutes, it's going to get me, it's
[07:53.030 --> 07:55.830]  going to start moving in. I'm starting to feel warm. My eyes are getting a little heavy
[07:55.830 --> 07:59.910]  on my attention is moving around. It's not right here like it should be. It's an edible
[07:59.910 --> 08:03.750]  show. We're going to be just fine. I'm good with that. I'm a fucking professional. Well,
[08:03.750 --> 08:05.550]  the worst thing that's going to happen is I'm going to get too high and we're going
[08:05.550 --> 08:09.350]  to make a shitty podcast. Like I'm not going to have to call my mom and get help or anything.
[08:09.350 --> 08:14.150]  Yeah, yeah. But some people, if this is their first experience and they get that, oh God,
[08:14.150 --> 08:17.830]  I'm too high. It could ruin the whole idea of using it for medicine. We may make them
[08:17.830 --> 08:21.870]  gun shy. Like if the first experience was something sucks, we could totally ruin it
[08:21.870 --> 08:26.670]  for them forever. So yeah, eat that first dose and give it a solid hour. And then if
[08:26.670 --> 08:30.470]  you don't feel it, wait a little bit longer and eat another small dose because you don't
[08:30.470 --> 08:35.430]  want to realize about an hour and 20 in that both of those doses are kicking in. Like that's,
[08:35.430 --> 08:41.550]  that's when it gets shitty. If you live in a legalization area, you should be able to
[08:41.550 --> 08:50.910]  buy store-bought edibles that are lab tested for consistency, potency, and it's easy to
[08:50.910 --> 09:00.030]  identify how much of your candy bar cookie or brownie or candy is five milligrams, 10
[09:00.030 --> 09:05.470]  milligrams, 20 milligrams. So I'm going to show this, this candy bar, this was a hundred.
[09:05.470 --> 09:10.790]  It's divided into obvious small pieces. Each of those triangles is a little five milligram
[09:10.790 --> 09:14.310]  piece. And so I know just by breaking off one of those five milligram pieces, I know
[09:14.310 --> 09:18.350]  exactly what I'm eating. I just popped a five milligram piece into my mouth a moment ago.
[09:18.350 --> 09:22.270]  I know exactly how much medicine I'm getting. I'm not going to overdo it. I'm not going
[09:22.270 --> 09:23.270]  to underdo it.
[09:23.270 --> 09:25.950]  One beautiful gummy.
[09:25.950 --> 09:28.390]  It's got the stamp on it to show you how much it is.
[09:28.390 --> 09:34.710]  Yep. You can't see it in my poorly lit studio, but it says right on the front, 10 milligrams
[09:34.710 --> 09:41.230]  THC, or I should say it says THC exclamation point. Like you see on the bottle here.
[09:41.230 --> 09:44.070]  That is printed on these. I was going to pick it up and show it to you again, but it melted
[09:44.070 --> 09:45.070]  on my finger.
[09:45.070 --> 09:46.750]  On every edible in Colorado.
[09:47.150 --> 09:50.590]  Yeah. These have that stamped on there as well. It says THC with an exclamation point
[09:50.590 --> 09:55.710]  and it says CODA on there. So I know that every bite of this is a THC laden chocolate
[09:55.710 --> 10:01.270]  bar. There's no hiding it. Maybe if it melted, but that's a totally different story. The
[10:01.270 --> 10:04.870]  packaging, this was a bitch for me to open. I'm an adult and this was still hard for me
[10:04.870 --> 10:09.070]  to open. So kids getting into this would be a challenge. I love the little division. It
[10:09.070 --> 10:10.070]  makes it real easy.
[10:10.070 --> 10:12.470]  Yeah. It was one of the first rule regs we did was making it hard to get into.
[10:12.470 --> 10:13.470]  Yeah.
[10:13.470 --> 10:15.710]  And covering it in labels.
[10:15.710 --> 10:22.430]  One of my only complaints about the Colorado edible industry is I have dietary restrictions
[10:22.430 --> 10:27.710]  and I am breaking my diet. They're my own restrictions. I place them on myself. I have
[10:27.710 --> 10:31.130]  to flex those. I have to be flexible with them to consume this. This doesn't fit into
[10:31.130 --> 10:36.710]  my general guidelines of my dietary restrictions. I wish there were more things available for
[10:36.710 --> 10:40.550]  what I'm looking for. But if I want to get good and medicated, I got to eat some chocolate
[10:40.550 --> 10:44.790]  or some gummies or something. And I opted for chocolate to be my thing. Dude, honestly,
[10:44.870 --> 10:49.790]  since I've been eating on the diet that I'm on, this chocolate is fucking delicious. This
[10:49.790 --> 10:52.830]  is special.
[10:52.830 --> 10:58.630]  We used to have anything could be infused in Colorado and then that scared the shit
[10:58.630 --> 11:04.870]  out of some people. So they put some brackets around what we can infuse and what we can't.
[11:04.870 --> 11:08.190]  Shout out to the ganja gourmet back in the day.
[11:08.190 --> 11:14.750]  There's quite a few options though. So if you're looking for something special or you
[11:15.230 --> 11:19.270]  want to try something unique, you can take some time on something like Weed Maps and
[11:19.270 --> 11:25.150]  find something that you want to try. And everything recreational in Colorado will be 100 milligrams
[11:25.150 --> 11:30.390]  a package, 10 milligrams a piece. So if you've never consumed before, it's super easy to
[11:30.390 --> 11:35.670]  say, oh, I'm going to take half a piece and start with five. Or if you're a regular consumer,
[11:35.670 --> 11:39.150]  it's easy to start with 20, 30, 40 milligrams.
[11:39.150 --> 11:42.430]  Yeah. I'm 25 in now.
[11:42.430 --> 11:48.710]  Start slow and build slow. It's a lot of fun to get stoned. It's a lot of fun to eat a
[11:48.710 --> 11:56.150]  couple of edibles and go for a nice ride. It's not fun to get way too high. It's like
[11:56.150 --> 12:02.230]  Jeff mentioned before, the saying is you can't uneat drugs. Like once it's in the tummy,
[12:02.230 --> 12:05.830]  you're on the roller coaster. There's no putting your hand up. There's no getting off the roller
[12:05.830 --> 12:11.750]  coaster early. You're on that fucker until she comes to a stop on its own volition. And
[12:11.750 --> 12:15.510]  that might be an hour. That might be seven hours. How much did you eat?
[12:15.510 --> 12:18.390]  Some tears and some diapers involved in that ride.
[12:18.390 --> 12:23.710]  There's some famous instances of people coming to Colorado and over consuming and then writing
[12:23.710 --> 12:30.630]  about it for major publications. And you should take the time to read those accounts or to
[12:30.630 --> 12:36.870]  go on YouTube and type in cop calls 911 after eating pot brownie.
[12:36.990 --> 12:43.350]  Yeah. That's a good one too. Don't be that guy. Don't be that guy. So I highly recommend
[12:43.350 --> 12:47.350]  if you can get some store bought edibles. I love if your friend makes edibles, that's
[12:47.350 --> 12:51.430]  awesome. But if you're new at it, let's get something from the store because I don't know.
[12:51.430 --> 12:55.070]  Mike may have put a gram of some concentrate in some edibles and stirred it up. And he's
[12:55.070 --> 12:59.870]  like, those are, there was 85 grams, milligrams of THC in that concentrate. So then that means
[12:59.870 --> 13:03.710]  there's 85 in here. There are six pieces. Do the math. That's what you're getting. I
[13:03.710 --> 13:07.030]  don't know. Who knows if that was really what was in that concentrate. Who knows if
[13:07.030 --> 13:10.950]  Mike started all the way. Who knows if I got the piece on the corner with all of the concentrate.
[13:10.950 --> 13:16.070]  Who knows if Mike got the piece with all the concentrate. I prefer a lab and I know not
[13:16.070 --> 13:18.830]  everybody. Some people are in places where that's not an option. They're giving me the
[13:18.830 --> 13:22.390]  finger saying I'm going to take what I can get, do that, enjoy that. But if you've got
[13:22.390 --> 13:23.390]  the option.
[13:23.390 --> 13:25.910]  Most of the world's not spoiled like us, but if you've got the option.
[13:25.910 --> 13:30.550]  A lot of the States have become spoiled like us. So it is kind of an option. Get those.
[13:30.550 --> 13:35.270]  And also I don't even, I just, this is a side branch. It's not even on my paper. Maybe
[13:35.270 --> 13:37.790]  you're getting, if you're in another state and you're buying edibles that look like they're
[13:37.790 --> 13:41.430]  from Colorado, be careful. Maybe that's just a Hershey bar or something that your homie
[13:41.430 --> 13:45.230]  made that they got some, they ate all the good edibles from the Colorado packaging and
[13:45.230 --> 13:51.150]  repackaged that shit and just sent it along. So be careful. If your edibles come in suspiciously
[13:51.150 --> 13:56.590]  familiar packaging, like if it says reefers instead of Snickers on it or instead of Reese's,
[13:56.590 --> 14:01.030]  it's probably not a legit store bought edible because all those have been stopped because
[14:01.030 --> 14:04.590]  of the copyright laws. So that's a good way to tell that, Hey, I'm buying a weird edible
[14:04.590 --> 14:10.070]  right here, but I prefer a lab tested edible, something made in a Colorado regulated kitchen.
[14:10.070 --> 14:13.350]  I'm kind of picky about not only what I'll eat, but who I will eat from.
[14:13.350 --> 14:21.070]  I mean, not to be weird with it, but like we're fucking old now. Like I can't accidentally
[14:21.070 --> 14:24.630]  get too glazed and miss 36 hours of my life.
[14:24.630 --> 14:25.870]  You got two kids, dude.
[14:26.150 --> 14:31.870]  Yeah. If I go AWOL for 36 hours, I wake up with like cops looking for me and shit. Like
[14:31.870 --> 14:39.510]  it's no bueno for everybody involved. And so I used to work with a dude who made fire
[14:39.510 --> 14:48.630]  edibles and I was always happy to gobble one down, but like now I'd make sure it was a
[14:48.630 --> 14:54.350]  really safe moment to eat one of those where I could miss 10 hours in B.I.
[14:54.350 --> 14:55.350]  Yeah.
[14:55.350 --> 15:00.430]  And with the store bought, you can avoid that. Like I know exactly what my experience is
[15:00.430 --> 15:07.670]  going to be regardless of if I got the coffee and donuts or if I got gummies or breath strips.
[15:07.670 --> 15:11.750]  I know that I'm 30 milligrams in now and I know that I can handle that and I didn't accidentally
[15:11.750 --> 15:16.070]  consume the bottom brownie or the fucking bottom scoop with something with all the potency
[15:16.070 --> 15:17.990]  in it. And I know that we're good.
[15:17.990 --> 15:21.350]  So mine are getting me right behind the eyes right now. I'm enjoying the shit out of it.
[15:21.350 --> 15:25.790]  Yeah. These bright lights, dude. Jeez. The bright lights and edibles are a fun combination.
[15:25.790 --> 15:28.830]  And also if anybody's saying, why aren't you recording with the fancy camera? It's easier
[15:28.830 --> 15:32.630]  to zoom. I'm waiting for a piece of equipment so I can link up to Sony camera so that we
[15:32.630 --> 15:36.670]  could zoom with that. Sorry, I'm not in 4K today. You guys probably a relief on your
[15:36.670 --> 15:42.990]  eyes to not see me in 4K for once, but I'm purple. So it makes up for it. I highly prefer
[15:42.990 --> 15:47.030]  the store bought edibles. That was my last note that we went over. If you can get them,
[15:47.030 --> 15:51.510]  if not eat what you can do, good luck. If you're making them, make sure you stir that
[15:51.510 --> 15:55.910]  shit up. We don't want one brownie, but it's all of the potency. One brownie that, yeah.
[15:55.910 --> 16:02.230]  Get online and take some time and try to get your dose in where, where you've got a concept
[16:02.230 --> 16:07.070]  of what it might be. I've hurt myself with homemade edibles before.
[16:07.070 --> 16:10.950]  We all have. We all have. I think. Do you know any of those people that say edibles
[16:10.950 --> 16:14.830]  simply don't work on them? Like edibles just don't work. What do you recommend for them?
[16:14.830 --> 16:20.350]  Come to Colorado and get one of those a thousand milligram bars at a medical shop and eat that
[16:20.350 --> 16:22.390]  whole thing and hang out with me and see what happens?
[16:22.390 --> 16:23.390]  No.
[16:23.390 --> 16:25.390]  Well, if they say it doesn't work.
[16:25.390 --> 16:32.390]  Slow buildup. One of the things I like to do with the new product is, you know, I eat
[16:32.390 --> 16:37.630]  10 and then two hours later I eat 20 and then two hours later I eat 30, two hours later
[16:37.630 --> 16:44.630]  I eat 40 and just let that rollercoaster ride begin. And usually 10 don't do shit, but by
[16:44.630 --> 16:51.030]  the time I'm eating 40 at a chunk, like game on. And for the people that say edibles don't
[16:51.030 --> 17:00.670]  work for me, it's usually they bought an undetermined quality of pot at some point and somehow tried
[17:00.670 --> 17:09.390]  to make food with it. And it wasn't successful. And that's their edibles don't work on me
[17:09.390 --> 17:14.310]  story. And that's where it comes from. And it's like, well, did you put it in the oven
[17:14.310 --> 17:20.910]  at 375 for 40 minutes and just burn out all the THC? Or did you get a shitty eight, the
[17:20.910 --> 17:26.670]  mids and then put it into a too big a tray. And so there was only seven milligrams per
[17:26.670 --> 17:27.670]  brownie.
[17:27.670 --> 17:32.430]  Like what happened here? And then I see people that also buy an edible and they say, well,
[17:32.430 --> 17:35.390]  I ate part of it before I went into work and then part of it at lunch. And I gave part
[17:35.390 --> 17:39.390]  of it to my friend. And I'm like, so nobody got high. Like you just spread fucking a bunch
[17:39.390 --> 17:44.070]  of milligrams around so far that nothing you ate like three before lunch and three at work.
[17:44.830 --> 17:45.830]  Yeah. Everybody microdosed.
[17:45.830 --> 17:49.630]  Yeah. Everybody and nobody felt a goddamn thing from it. Yeah. I see that as sort of
[17:49.630 --> 17:51.030]  a thing as well.
[17:51.030 --> 17:56.990]  We get, you can get pills here in Colorado that are just 10 milligram pills. And I used
[17:56.990 --> 18:02.870]  to love those throughout the day and more than once. Like, did I take some at the beginning
[18:02.870 --> 18:06.910]  of my lunch break at the end of my lunch break? I don't remember. I'll take two more on my
[18:06.910 --> 18:12.830]  way back in. And then right before third break, you're sitting there holding onto the counter,
[18:12.830 --> 18:16.030]  like trying to maintain eye contact.
[18:16.030 --> 18:19.510]  So I did take those. I did take those other edibles. Oops.
[18:19.510 --> 18:22.910]  Took some at the start of my break, in the middle of the break and at the end of the
[18:22.910 --> 18:25.630]  break and now I'm fucking glazed like a ham.
[18:25.630 --> 18:31.110]  Perfect. So you were talking, you said a minute ago about putting the herb in the oven or
[18:31.110 --> 18:38.030]  putting the brownie mix in the oven. Let's talk about decarbing and decarboxylation.
[18:38.030 --> 18:41.630]  I'm going to sound like Joe Rogan for a minute here. And you guys have all heard this rant
[18:41.630 --> 18:45.310]  from Joe Rogan. Something different happens when you eat medical cannabis or cannabis.
[18:45.310 --> 18:48.670]  It does not become when normal cannabis, when you consume it, when you smoke it, you consume
[18:48.670 --> 18:53.070]  Delta 9 THC. That gives you the buzz that you're used to. Delta 9 THC. There's probably
[18:53.070 --> 18:57.170]  CBD and other cannabinoids in there. But then one we're fucking familiar with is the THC.
[18:57.170 --> 19:02.430]  That's what I'm after. Give me Delta 9 THC. When you eat that, your body converts it into
[19:02.430 --> 19:09.710]  11 hydroxy THC or hydroxy THC, which makes it more psychoactive, more bioavailable to
[19:09.710 --> 19:13.270]  your body. It makes it longer lasting. It makes it deeper penetrating is something that
[19:13.270 --> 19:17.310]  I wrote down. And we'll talk about why I said that in a minute. But that is the scientific
[19:17.310 --> 19:21.110]  thing of what's happening. That's why you get a different buzz from it. It becomes something
[19:21.110 --> 19:25.950]  different in your liver. Your liver heats it up, processes it. It becomes this hydroxy
[19:25.950 --> 19:30.030]  THC, which is different than Delta 9. Different, different compound, different buzz, treats
[19:30.030 --> 19:33.150]  you differently. That's the main thing that's happening. So now that leads me into talking
[19:33.150 --> 19:37.370]  about decarbing. When you take cannabis flowers, if you're going to make edibles, it needs
[19:37.370 --> 19:41.490]  to be decarbed to make it more bioavailable for your body. If you just took a bunch of
[19:41.490 --> 19:45.110]  weed and ate it, you may get a little bit of buzz. If you took that weed and heated
[19:45.110 --> 19:49.610]  it to the appropriate temperature to activate those cannabinoids, you would get a much better
[19:49.610 --> 19:53.210]  buzz. Sometimes that happens in the cooking or baking process, but a lot of times it will
[19:53.210 --> 19:57.530]  be done. Sometimes it happens in the extraction process. If you're making a concentrate, it'll
[19:57.530 --> 20:01.610]  kind of decarb there as well. Sometimes you may need to decarb your product on its own.
[20:01.610 --> 20:05.090]  If you're making a butter or something, you may need to decarb that butter. So that is
[20:05.090 --> 20:08.850]  something you need to research. That makes the, I don't make edibles. I'm not an edible
[20:08.850 --> 20:12.850]  professional, but if you're making edibles, decarbing, decarboxylation is something I
[20:12.850 --> 20:17.330]  highly recommend you do some research on. That is what makes that Delta 11 available
[20:17.330 --> 20:21.950]  in your body, even more bioavailable. There's another thing called nanoinfusion. I don't
[20:21.950 --> 20:25.890]  understand nanoinfusion completely. Part of what I read, some people say it's not good
[20:25.890 --> 20:32.030]  to consume nanoinfused products. So read about nanoinfusion. I tried a product that was a
[20:32.030 --> 20:36.410]  liquid syrupy type product. It was, I don't even like talking about it. It was like sauce
[20:36.410 --> 20:39.870]  or syrup is what it's trying to act like, but you can just pour a little bit of this
[20:39.870 --> 20:43.270]  stuff in a cup and drink it and don't even drink it like sauce. Just drink it like itself
[20:43.270 --> 20:47.310]  and know that you're going to get lit from it. It was a thousand milligrams of nanoinfused
[20:47.310 --> 20:52.110]  drink and I drank just a little sip of it and I could feel it hit my body too quickly.
[20:52.110 --> 20:58.370]  It was like, go, go, go. Whoa, that was fast. So I don't, that's scary high, scary quickly
[20:58.370 --> 21:02.970]  to me. I can really mess myself up with that. So if you want to get medicated super quickly,
[21:02.970 --> 21:07.190]  check out the nanoinfused drink products that are available in California, not in Colorado
[21:07.190 --> 21:11.970]  is that I know of because they're so potent. But so you got to decarb things and then check
[21:11.970 --> 21:16.690]  out nanoinfusion. That was my quick, the part that I did write a couple of detailed notes
[21:16.690 --> 21:19.410]  about. So Mike, it looks like you got something to say, bail me out.
[21:19.410 --> 21:26.810]  Mike Altraeb Well, the edibles, the sum up version of what Jeff just said is they, edibles
[21:26.810 --> 21:33.330]  hit harder and last longer than smoking it. The other thing when you're smoking it, you
[21:33.330 --> 21:40.930]  can, it's called titrate. You can titrate your dose a lot smoother and a lot more precise.
[21:40.930 --> 21:44.130]  I'm trying to think of a good analogy right here and I think it's the edibles that are
[21:44.130 --> 21:52.530]  fucking me up here. But smoking is like paying for stuff with loose change. Like you can
[21:52.530 --> 21:59.210]  be super precise, but edibles is like paying for stuff with gold bars. Like there's going
[21:59.210 --> 22:03.610]  to be a lot of like waiting around for your, your change to come back to you. It's not
[22:03.610 --> 22:09.290]  precise at all. You got to go with a big old chunk. Like, but once you dial it in, I've
[22:09.290 --> 22:18.530]  seen so many people roast themselves with edibles. Like we used to get vegetable oil
[22:18.530 --> 22:24.330]  that was infused by someone else in college and the brownies we would make just had a
[22:24.330 --> 22:30.450]  reputation for like, sometimes it was a nice, mild, pleasant, and other times it was like
[22:30.450 --> 22:38.610]  a sledgehammer to the forehead for 12 hours and good Lord. Like I've seen people do it
[22:38.610 --> 22:42.770]  the same with the store-bought edibles. You start thinking about it, you intend to eat
[22:42.770 --> 22:47.210]  30 milligrams. The next thing you know, like something funny happened in front of you on
[22:47.210 --> 22:52.250]  the television or on your phone. And now you're 60 milligrams deep before you realize
[22:52.250 --> 22:53.250]  what you're doing.
[22:53.250 --> 22:58.410]  Yup. Especially with good candy, like what I'm munching on. So the downside is that they
[22:58.410 --> 23:03.130]  come on super strong and they can take you into a different realm. I like Joey Diaz says
[23:03.130 --> 23:06.770]  you can fucking see the devil or you can see God depends on what the fuck, which edibles
[23:06.770 --> 23:11.810]  you ate. But that's why they're so useful. That's why they're so helpful for the medical
[23:11.810 --> 23:14.930]  community or for I'm trying to get high off. I like to get real high. I don't have to take
[23:14.930 --> 23:18.170]  four dabs. Like if I were going to go somewhere and didn't want to go dab, I could just take
[23:18.170 --> 23:22.890]  one of these with me and just sneak it into my mouth and we'd be cool. But it's very,
[23:22.890 --> 23:26.830]  it's longer lasting. And I think it's really, once you dial in your dosage, I think it's
[23:26.830 --> 23:31.810]  cost effective. The edibles aren't too expensive compared to how much I smoke and what my smoke
[23:31.810 --> 23:36.530]  products cost compared to what the edibles cost. It's still cost effective. It mats out.
[23:36.530 --> 23:40.990]  And I feel like it goes, this may be a weird way to put it. I feel like it goes deeper.
[23:40.990 --> 23:45.870]  Like if I've got some pain, I can smoke. And if I've got like level six back pain,
[23:45.870 --> 23:49.550]  it'll take it to like a three. But if you got level seven back pain and you eat edibles,
[23:49.550 --> 23:53.850]  it'll knock you down to a two. Like the edibles are just nowhere to go. They're like, they're
[23:53.850 --> 23:58.150]  swimming around in your body going, Oh, it hurts over here. Watch. And Oh, it hurts over
[23:58.150 --> 24:03.590]  here. My knees are, my knees are, my back are really hurting. Um, I go with edibles
[24:03.590 --> 24:09.230]  to, to attack the pain, not smoking. It's all sit here and dab for all afternoon trying
[24:09.230 --> 24:16.630]  to get rid of knee pain. But if I chew down a CBD gummy and four or five THC, 10 milligrammers,
[24:16.630 --> 24:21.950]  so I'm at like 50 and 50, um, within an hour and a half, my knee pain will be dialed back
[24:21.950 --> 24:23.990]  to a two or three.
[24:23.990 --> 24:30.830]  Do you feel like the CBD, uh, inhibits the giggly fun time buzz from the THC, but makes
[24:30.830 --> 24:35.470]  it more focused on the pain relief? All right. And that's why I know they work really, really
[24:35.470 --> 24:43.070]  well together. Um, it does tend to dial back the Stoney. Um, one of the other phenomena
[24:43.070 --> 24:49.750]  I wanted to bring up on this episode, ask you if you've experienced it. Um, I've experienced
[24:49.750 --> 24:56.350]  it repeatedly lately. Um, I'm pretty good at it, knowing where my tolerance is. If I'm
[24:56.350 --> 25:02.270]  smoking flour, dabs, edibles, and I'll be riding like a nice, pleasant, like three or
[25:02.270 --> 25:08.470]  four level high, like out of 10, I'm just rocking out at a three or four maintaining.
[25:08.470 --> 25:15.470]  And then something environmental wise happens and it takes me to a fucking nine just out
[25:15.470 --> 25:23.670]  of nowhere. And I end up just laughing hysterically or I mean, it's usually laughing hysterically
[25:23.670 --> 25:26.630]  or destroying a bunch of food out of nowhere.
[25:26.630 --> 25:31.830]  I love when you eat edibles and then go somewhere and you're at like the mall or at the sneaker
[25:31.890 --> 25:37.110]  shop or somewhere. And you're like, Oh wait, Oh shit. There's those edibles. They just
[25:37.110 --> 25:41.590]  got me just now. Like, Oh, we, this is going to be, I gotta get out of the mall or I gotta
[25:41.590 --> 25:45.750]  leave target. Like I gotta, where's my car? And you just ditch your, ditch your shopping
[25:45.750 --> 25:50.510]  cart and you just fucking bail. I'm done. Bye. Yeah.
[25:50.510 --> 25:59.350]  When I first got into the, this gummy brand, um, I met the owner doing a political campaign
[25:59.350 --> 26:06.070]  thing. And then like two months later, the holidays came around and I needed something
[26:06.070 --> 26:11.150]  that was going to be even more discreet than a vapor pen. And it was like, there's nothing
[26:11.150 --> 26:21.490]  more discreet than gummies. Yeah. Um, and, uh, just fantastic. But I found myself slightly
[26:21.490 --> 26:28.550]  over medicated it like now go get seconds at Thanksgiving. So it was kind of a perfect
[26:28.750 --> 26:31.590]  fortuitous little moment for it.
[26:31.590 --> 26:33.310]  Did you still go get seconds, bro?
[26:33.310 --> 26:34.430]  Oh, for sure.
[26:34.430 --> 26:40.550]  Of course you did. Sure. That's the best thing when you're over medicated is food.
[26:40.550 --> 26:46.630]  The last time I had a black market edible, I thought I was fine. And I was scrolling
[26:46.630 --> 26:52.310]  through one of those, like, here's 12 funny memes about whatever the fuck, it wasn't even
[26:52.310 --> 26:56.750]  anything particular. And it wouldn't have hit me like this at any other moment. But
[26:56.910 --> 27:03.550]  with my medicated level and the, the situation I was in, I about died in a parking lot behind
[27:03.550 --> 27:08.790]  a place like everybody else was in the next room eating chicken. I'm in the back, just
[27:08.790 --> 27:11.990]  curled up on the floor.
[27:11.990 --> 27:13.790]  TikTok isn't that funny until you eat.
[27:13.790 --> 27:20.710]  It wasn't even TikTok. It was just, uh, it was just a regular ass picture and word meme
[27:20.710 --> 27:24.590]  list. And it was hitting me like Tyson.
[27:24.590 --> 27:26.590]  That's great. That is great.
[27:26.590 --> 27:31.550]  Edibles are wonderful for that, man. If you want to make an, take an afternoon from ordinary
[27:31.550 --> 27:34.990]  to extraordinary, I recommend some fucking edibles.
[27:34.990 --> 27:39.710]  Yeah, I had to take a break because I worked with a group of savages and we were all just
[27:39.710 --> 27:43.310]  eating way too many edibles. People that listen to the podcast back in the day.
[27:43.310 --> 27:47.670]  Thousands of milligrams do not belong on a single piece of bacon. That's all I'm going
[27:47.670 --> 27:48.670]  to say.
[27:48.670 --> 27:52.070]  Yeah, we were, I'm not a bacon consumer, but there were, there were a thousand milligram
[27:52.070 --> 27:56.550]  edibles eaten during work shifts and work did get done. Not, not all of it, but the
[27:56.550 --> 27:58.590]  work was happening.
[27:58.590 --> 28:03.990]  One of your favorite stories involves somebody getting too glazed to sing.
[28:03.990 --> 28:04.990]  Oh yeah.
[28:04.990 --> 28:09.710]  I haven't seen, I haven't seen a performer do it, but I've seen a lot of other people
[28:09.710 --> 28:13.630]  who had shit to do that was like, nope, they had one too many brownies and they're just
[28:13.630 --> 28:16.110]  going to stay on the couch till Wednesday.
[28:16.110 --> 28:21.230]  We actually were at a dab event and there was a rapper who raps about dabs and he took
[28:21.390 --> 28:27.550]  a dab on stage and had to have the crowd come up and karaoke his songs for him because he
[28:27.550 --> 28:30.830]  was dabbed the fuck out and couldn't sing anymore. It was pretty funny.
[28:30.830 --> 28:33.670]  Shout out to Hash. It'll fuck up your day.
[28:33.670 --> 28:36.510]  Yes, or fix it. Both. I'm not sure.
[28:36.510 --> 28:37.510]  Both.
[28:37.510 --> 28:41.630]  All right, Mike, I feel like I've covered all of my bullet points. Do you have any notes
[28:41.630 --> 28:45.990]  written down that you'd like to cover or is it time to turn it into a ramble fest here?
[28:45.990 --> 28:47.470]  We talked about going easy.
[28:47.470 --> 28:48.750]  Yes, we did.
[28:48.750 --> 28:53.870]  I brought up that it seems like a kinder, gentler reintroduction or introduction to
[28:53.870 --> 29:00.910]  cannabis, but because of your inability to slowly dose yourself, it tends not to be that
[29:00.910 --> 29:01.910]  gentle.
[29:01.910 --> 29:08.580]  Yeah, those are the main points.
[29:08.580 --> 29:13.660]  All right. All right. I think we got all the business part covered up on the show. That
[29:13.660 --> 29:18.060]  was a fun show, Mike. Good edible lesson. I hope people learned something. I got edibled
[29:18.060 --> 29:20.900]  out, so I'm not sure how much we taught.
[29:21.620 --> 29:25.900]  I was just sitting here thinking how long have we been going? That's when I realized
[29:25.900 --> 29:30.140]  how hard the edibles have hit me. I honestly can't tell you how long we've been talking.
[29:30.140 --> 29:31.140]  I know that it's-
[29:31.140 --> 29:32.140]  Perfect.
[29:32.140 --> 29:36.740]  I know what time it is. I can still read the clock, but I don't remember what time we hit
[29:36.740 --> 29:37.740]  go.
[29:37.740 --> 29:39.740]  I do, so it's perfect. I'm not going to tell you because I like-
[29:39.740 --> 29:40.740]  I hope you all learned some shit.
[29:40.740 --> 29:43.460]  I like the level of confusion in your eye.
[29:43.460 --> 29:48.060]  You should definitely reach out and interact with us on social media if you've got edible
[29:48.060 --> 29:49.060]  questions.
[29:49.300 --> 29:53.020]  There you go. That's a great thing for a great segue for us. If you'd like to reach out to
[29:53.020 --> 29:57.220]  us, if you've got corrections, questions, comments, updates, or concerns, my email address
[29:57.220 --> 30:02.140]  is growfromyourheartathotmail.com. You can reach Mike at NemoPunk15 on Twitter is probably
[30:02.140 --> 30:05.940]  the best way. I just drank a bunch of water and it's trying to make me burp while I'm
[30:05.940 --> 30:08.060]  speaking. Excuse me for that.
[30:08.060 --> 30:12.220]  Yeah. Also, if you feel like the episode was educational, informative, or entertaining,
[30:12.220 --> 30:15.740]  we would appreciate it if you support us on Patreon. You can find me at patreon.com forward
[30:15.740 --> 30:20.740]  slash growfromyourheart. Mike's Patreon is very similar. It's patreon.com forward slash
[30:20.740 --> 30:24.700]  white Mike. How could you forget that? Support white Mike. I'm not done with the show, but
[30:24.700 --> 30:27.020]  I thought it'd be a good time to shout out all that good stuff.
[30:27.020 --> 30:31.100]  Good time to drop the contact info in case y'all want to reach out and laugh at us for
[30:31.100 --> 30:35.420]  being too glazed to remember what our last couple bullet points on the edible show were.
[30:35.420 --> 30:40.780]  That's why I did the Patreon and the email addresses now, just in case. I've got notes,
[30:40.780 --> 30:45.740]  but they've gone to shit. They're all half crossed out, half out of order now. So I haven't
[30:45.740 --> 30:51.980]  been doing paper notes. I've gone mostly digital on the new podcast format. Yeah. But I've got,
[30:51.980 --> 30:55.340]  since I'm doing the zoom, I've got you are on my note screen right now. So I'm trying
[30:55.340 --> 30:58.540]  to go paperless. Yeah. I'd be a little bit more. That's one or two sheets of paper every
[30:58.540 --> 31:02.100]  episode that I'm not wasting. It's going to be more cost-effective, more environmentally
[31:02.100 --> 31:07.020]  friendly and why am I doing it on paper? Like a caveman anyway, I got digital stuff.
[31:07.980 --> 31:14.540]  2020 baby. Yeah, dude. We upgraded all the toys. Let's go digital. The new studio sounds
[31:14.540 --> 31:18.860]  really good. Like that microphone sounds crispy with my headphones tonight. Thank you. You
[31:18.860 --> 31:22.220]  got, you sound pretty great too. He's did a fucking good job staying on the mic. I got
[31:22.220 --> 31:27.340]  you turned up pretty hot over here. So hopefully the listeners can hear me too. Yeah. I sounded
[31:27.340 --> 31:31.500]  great to us. The shows where they said they couldn't hear me. This new device, shout out
[31:31.500 --> 31:36.780]  to the pod track P4 makes us both sound pretty good. Yeah. Shout out to the new piece of
[31:36.780 --> 31:42.940]  tech making me sound crispy. I 40 milligrams of edibles. I think I feel about 20 or 30
[31:42.940 --> 31:45.900]  of them right now. I'm moving through my body. My palms are getting a little bit sweaty.
[31:45.900 --> 31:48.540]  My eyes are a little bit heavy. I like it. I'm going to try to hang on and just keep
[31:48.540 --> 31:52.460]  podcasting for a few so that we can see what happens to us over the course of this podcast
[31:52.460 --> 31:57.140]  here over the next few minutes. You want to grab an email? You want to do some rambles?
[31:57.140 --> 32:02.020]  I didn't prepare anything like that. I did not prepare anything. Let's talk about, here's
[32:02.020 --> 32:05.300]  some fun shit we could talk about. Nothing to, we can't fuck this up. We can't miss any
[32:05.300 --> 32:09.340]  notes. We can't do anything wrong. We can give a huge shout out to our friend, Karen.
[32:09.340 --> 32:13.780]  Rest in peace, Karen. I love you. I miss you. Hope you're well. Shout out to Tom also. Let's
[32:13.780 --> 32:19.420]  talk about when we used to manage a dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado. Mike and I had the, and
[32:19.420 --> 32:23.580]  some other friends, it wasn't just Mike and I. There was a group of us that managed and
[32:23.580 --> 32:27.020]  ran. I was the fucking general manager, I guess would have been if there was a real
[32:27.020 --> 32:33.660]  title in that place. I was the fucking, the guy that did, yeah. Yeah. Tom was the owner
[32:33.660 --> 32:38.060]  guy. I was the guy right under Tom. Then Mike was right next to me. And then there was a
[32:38.060 --> 32:41.860]  couple other people that were working with us. Chrisanne was like everybody's fucking
[32:41.860 --> 32:49.220]  like second right-hand man. She was amazing. Tree was amazing. But Tom was the owner and
[32:49.220 --> 32:53.380]  Karen was Tom's wife. She unfortunately passed away. We miss you, Karen. I always got a fucking
[32:54.180 --> 32:56.180]  spot in my heart for Karen. Nothing but love for that lady. She was one of the sweetest
[32:56.180 --> 33:02.780]  people I've ever, ever interacted with. Like genuinely sweet. Karen sweet. She also made
[33:02.780 --> 33:08.500]  a wicked edible. She made, she made baked goods. She made fudge candies, anything, not
[33:08.500 --> 33:12.620]  just medicated, but she could make anything. She cooked and she was, she was just a sweet
[33:12.620 --> 33:19.260]  lady that loved to nourish people. She made amazing medicated edibles. Fudge. I've said
[33:19.260 --> 33:24.540]  that fudge two or three times now. That fudge was so good. The banana bread, the banana
[33:24.540 --> 33:29.220]  bread, the C the Christmas cookies with the sprinkles on them. The, uh, not the banana
[33:29.220 --> 33:33.620]  bread, the walnut bread. Was it? There's another kind of nut bread that she made that was delicious.
[33:33.620 --> 33:39.340]  They would serve us full meals and everything in the meal was medicated. She would make,
[33:39.340 --> 33:42.660]  so we had a dispensary and back in the day you could, first time I ever saw medicated
[33:42.660 --> 33:48.100]  barbecue sauce. Yeah. Yeah. Back then you could make edibles in your private kitchen
[33:48.100 --> 33:51.980]  at home and take them and sell them in your dispensary. That's how long ago this was.
[33:51.980 --> 33:56.500]  This was the wild, wild West in Colorado. Absolutely no rule days. Yeah. Yeah. This
[33:56.500 --> 34:00.420]  was just, however, we were inventing the rules as we went. They were making the rules around
[34:00.420 --> 34:06.940]  us is what they were doing. So Karen would make trays of fudge and banana bread and cookies
[34:06.940 --> 34:12.860]  and medicated cupcakes with medicated frosting, with medicated sprinkles and medicated syrup.
[34:12.860 --> 34:17.540]  And she would bring all these edibles to the office where we work and she would have a
[34:17.540 --> 34:21.620]  pile of, here's a cupcake for Mike and a cupcake for Jeff and medicated fudge for Mike
[34:21.620 --> 34:24.940]  and fudge for Jeff and one of everything for everybody that works there. One of everything
[34:24.940 --> 34:29.900]  for everybody. And she would encourage you to try all of them while you're at work today.
[34:29.900 --> 34:34.580]  So I would start off my work shift with a medicated cupcake. Like I mentioned before,
[34:34.580 --> 34:39.100]  the cupcake is medicated. The frosting is medicated. She put medication in the fucking
[34:39.100 --> 34:44.140]  sprinkles then put medicated syrup over it and then served me a drink with fucking ganja
[34:44.180 --> 34:48.900]  in that as well. So I'm washing down my medicated fucking cupcake with a medicated chocolate
[34:48.900 --> 34:55.620]  soy milk or some shit back in the day. We would get lit by lunch. And she would come
[34:55.620 --> 34:58.460]  check on us and be like, so what did you, what did you eat? And I'm like, I ate the
[34:58.460 --> 35:02.700]  cupcake and I'm lit. And she'd be like, cool. Now go eat the fudge and the two cookies and
[35:02.700 --> 35:07.100]  the glazed ham and the fucking other nine items I gave you and let us know what you
[35:07.100 --> 35:10.940]  think about that. And I'd be like, I can't handle it, dude. And they would encourage
[35:10.940 --> 35:15.140]  it and not even mind that sometimes I'd be working in the middle of a shift and just
[35:15.140 --> 35:19.980]  put my hands on my face and be like, I need a minute. I'm too high to even, I shouldn't
[35:19.980 --> 35:23.940]  even be fucking standing in public right now. And you've got me serving customers. Like
[35:23.940 --> 35:27.540]  give me just a minute to get my life together. They were cool with it. Like, ha ha, he ate
[35:27.540 --> 35:31.940]  too many of the cookies. Like it was, those were good old times. Shout out to Karen and
[35:31.940 --> 35:35.860]  Tom. I missed that place. That's where Mike and I met each other.
[35:35.860 --> 35:40.460]  I distinctly remember standing behind that counter, holding onto the underside of the
[35:40.460 --> 35:45.780]  counter, putting positive pressure with my arms, pushing my feet down on the ground a
[35:45.780 --> 35:51.180]  little bit harder than gravity was pushing me normally just to make sure I was all good
[35:51.180 --> 35:56.860]  for a minute. It just, there were definitely some fun times in that I fell down the stairs
[35:56.860 --> 36:04.820]  at that dispensary that had, it had a couple of nights and it had a 180 degree turn. So
[36:04.820 --> 36:07.820]  you go down one and then he turned one 80 and go down another turn one 80 and go down
[36:07.820 --> 36:11.940]  another instead of just one long fucking death fall. You got a few death falls. I fell
[36:11.940 --> 36:18.100]  down one and made the turn and fell down another flight too. Like actually made the fucking
[36:18.100 --> 36:23.480]  turn while I was falling. But I was so high on edibles that I was like that drunk driver
[36:23.480 --> 36:27.620]  that gets in a car wreck and all the sober people die. But the drunk driver is so gummied
[36:27.620 --> 36:30.660]  that he just fucking rubbers around in the car and nothing happens. That was me as I
[36:30.660 --> 36:35.620]  fell down the stairs. I just gumby legs, fucking jello rolled down that fucking thing. Yeah,
[36:35.620 --> 36:39.700]  I had a little job blessing and a little rubber roll going on. No pain. It was fucking
[36:39.700 --> 36:44.060]  hilarious. Everybody laughed at me. I laughed at me. Uh, that was a good time. Fell down
[36:44.060 --> 36:48.420]  the stairs high as shit. Shout out to metamorin ministries in Pueblo, Colorado. No longer
[36:48.420 --> 36:56.340]  exists. So many, so many firsts in that place, but the edibles, Oh good Lord. Yeah. That,
[36:56.340 --> 37:00.980]  uh, so good. That's the, that was the first time I learned the edibles could really be
[37:00.980 --> 37:08.100]  like amazingly delicious. Um, the ones I was making in college, every time the, especially
[37:08.100 --> 37:13.420]  when we were using the real potent oil, it's just that heavy green chlorophyll flavor.
[37:13.420 --> 37:21.220]  You can't escape. And, uh, the stuff Karen was making was legitimately delicious. Like
[37:21.220 --> 37:27.260]  it, it would have sold as a regular food item anywhere comfortably. Oh yeah. But it would
[37:27.260 --> 37:32.940]  have been a great thing to do. And then people knew that if they watch those cookies on the
[37:32.940 --> 37:37.100]  shelf, if those cookies didn't sell by Friday, that when you come in on Friday, that old
[37:37.100 --> 37:40.580]  lady comes in Saturday. So Jeff will give you cookies Friday evening. If you buy a lot
[37:40.580 --> 37:45.780]  of stuff like every Friday, like that after work rush, if there were 10 or 12 cookies
[37:45.780 --> 37:49.460]  left, if you bought an ounce, here's a cookie bro. Or if you were cool, like if you're just,
[37:49.460 --> 37:52.420]  there's some people that came in and we're just fucking cool. Some people are dicks,
[37:52.580 --> 37:57.700]  working at that dispensary randomly stacks of pizzas would show up. There's pizza hut
[37:57.700 --> 38:01.780]  would be like, Hey, this guy named Jake sent you 12 pizzas. And I'm like, fuck yeah. Jake's
[38:01.780 --> 38:04.580]  awesome, dude. I know Jake and his girlfriend. They come in here all the time. I remember
[38:04.580 --> 38:08.300]  them the next time you see Jake, guess what? He gets two fucking medicated cookies. Cause
[38:08.300 --> 38:11.420]  he just sent me pizzas last time. We used to get all kinds of cookies.
[38:11.420 --> 38:23.140]  was, there were maybe 30 dispensaries in the country then. Yeah. There were only four
[38:23.140 --> 38:31.940]  or six in the state of Colorado at the time. Um, then the broadster for anything existed.
[38:31.940 --> 38:36.920]  Yeah. The broadster dam explosion happened on Broadway in Denver. They called it little
[38:36.920 --> 38:41.520]  broadster dam because suddenly there were dispensaries on every other block. And that's
[38:41.520 --> 38:45.800]  when we hired you to come work with our dispensary so that I could get some time off. We hired
[38:45.800 --> 38:49.720]  a couple other people. I was working seven days a week from open to close as the only
[38:49.720 --> 38:54.040]  bud tender and the only guy there basically. Uh, so we had a couple other people hired
[38:54.040 --> 39:02.760]  on and then the owner was giving me funding on the weekends to go scout out other dispensaries.
[39:02.760 --> 39:06.560]  Like go to every shop that you can within this many miles, we drive up to Denver and
[39:06.560 --> 39:11.800]  fucking go hit 10 or 12 dispensary. There weren't even 10 or 12. Yep. Yep. We'd go
[39:11.800 --> 39:15.000]  hit four or five cause that's all there were at the time. Go hit four or five dispensaries,
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.680]  buy a couple of products from each one and then bring it down and show it to the owner
[39:18.680 --> 39:22.680]  of the dispensary and talk about how we can get better products and how we can set up
[39:22.680 --> 39:28.040]  like those dispensaries. So I've been doing recon work on that shit since 2008, 2007.
[39:28.040 --> 39:32.840]  Uh, yeah, we had a good time doing all that. Going and checking out other dispensaries,
[39:32.840 --> 39:38.000]  buying crazy good product and some terrible products back in the day. Going to buy edibles
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.640]  that were inedible. I was in walking distance from my house. And so like literally it was
[39:43.640 --> 39:52.120]  get up, tie your shoes, scroll up the block, open the world's first weed store. Like fucking
[39:52.120 --> 39:57.200]  fantasy land. It seems like a dream at this point. But before there were rules, there's
[39:57.200 --> 40:05.200]  a lot of fucking funny, a lot of funny that staircase. I don't know how none of us died.
[40:05.200 --> 40:11.200]  Well, even three or four pieces of banana bread and the shift and then having to run
[40:11.200 --> 40:16.040]  up to the fourth floor to grab more or something for, yeah, no, it should have killed one of
[40:16.040 --> 40:24.960]  us. Yes. Or the heat up on that fourth floor. Yeah. Did you ever go in the basement of that
[40:24.960 --> 40:30.520]  building? Nope. Yeah. There's no stairs. So you've got, you've got to, I never went
[40:30.520 --> 40:35.720]  to, I never, never went to be. Yeah. It's interesting down there. Um, so that was a
[40:35.720 --> 40:39.360]  random side rant there. Uh, nobody's ever been in that building. A lot of, maybe some
[40:39.360 --> 40:42.920]  people have been in that building that are listening. Not too many though. Um, the first
[40:42.920 --> 40:47.120]  dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado, there was one in the County, uh, outside of our city
[40:47.120 --> 40:50.640]  limits that was open at the same time. But I think we were getting the majority of the
[40:51.640 --> 40:58.480]  others opened. Um, I'm not even gonna say their names. With, uh, I think I only got
[40:58.480 --> 41:05.640]  the pleasure of working there for like six weeks or so. And literally when I started,
[41:05.640 --> 41:14.400]  there was one and it was Metamar and there was another one talking about opening their
[41:14.400 --> 41:21.520]  doors in the County. And it's the one you're thinking of. Yeah. And it's five or six weeks
[41:21.520 --> 41:27.520]  later when the city shut us down, there were like eight. Yeah. Our one friend opened two
[41:27.520 --> 41:36.480]  shops up pretty quickly. Yeah. And within the year there were 20. Yeah. And then we're
[41:36.480 --> 41:42.160]  driving up to Denver. That's when the first, I want to say the first regulation bill happened
[41:42.160 --> 41:51.360]  in 2010 and that's when we went from a thousand shops to 500 essentially overnight. The rules
[41:51.360 --> 41:56.600]  took a little while to kick in. I think it was a six month period where like they rolled
[41:56.600 --> 42:03.200]  out the first five big rules. Yeah. And those rules, five people, three months later, but
[42:03.200 --> 42:09.680]  yeah, it was one after the next Dr. Reefer disappeared. The spinning sign peoples, all
[42:09.680 --> 42:16.360]  those fucking stores disappeared. Let's elaborate on that a little bit. Everyone's going, what
[42:16.360 --> 42:21.360]  happened? So back in the day we called it the wild, wild West. You could grow, you could
[42:21.360 --> 42:25.840]  get herb from basically anywhere. It was medical cannabis. So everybody was growing at home.
[42:25.840 --> 42:29.640]  And if you got a medical marijuana card, you could increase your plant count dramatically
[42:29.640 --> 42:34.540]  back then. So you could grow pretty decent quantities of product. And I could backpack
[42:34.540 --> 42:39.020]  up four and a quarter pounds of herb and stop at four different dispensaries and sell
[42:39.020 --> 42:45.180]  four and a quarter pounds for cash. They would hand me somewhere between $700 and $1,000
[42:45.180 --> 42:48.780]  cash for a quarter pound of good weed. And I would leave, get in the car, drive to the
[42:48.780 --> 42:52.580]  next spot and do it until I was out of herb. Every harvest, just go dump them off at the
[42:52.580 --> 42:58.420]  dispensaries. Then the edibles. There were a million Jeffs running around the state to
[42:58.420 --> 43:04.420]  the handful of dispensaries that we had. And eventually it was like a thousand. Um,
[43:04.420 --> 43:11.260]  every shop had different herb. Nothing was regulated. There were no rules yet. The state
[43:11.260 --> 43:19.740]  was pretending like the industry didn't exist. And so the industry kept creating their own
[43:19.740 --> 43:28.000]  rules in hopes that when the state finally did look upon us, they weren't as horrified
[43:28.580 --> 43:29.580]  as they otherwise might be.
[43:29.580 --> 43:31.580]  Yeah. Yeah. That's a good way to put it.
[43:31.580 --> 43:43.920]  Which led to a lot of silliness at the time. But, um, I mean, it was just the perfect storm
[43:43.920 --> 43:52.900]  of like balls or chutzpah and I'm sick of this. I'm not, I'm just going to turn a blind
[43:52.900 --> 43:57.420]  eye from the cops. Because if you talk to law enforcement, which I ended up doing a
[43:57.420 --> 44:05.360]  lot when I was doing city council stuff, by the time we had a medical marijuana registry
[44:05.360 --> 44:13.000]  in cards, they were like, fuck it. I'm a look for cocaine. Like I'm just done. It's I'm
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.120]  tired of them saying they've got a card and then I've got to fucking look at the card
[44:17.120 --> 44:22.480]  and then they've got a plant count and then they can have so many. And fuck it. Like I
[44:22.580 --> 44:29.300]  just, you say weed. I say I'm here for the guns or the heroin. And you know what I mean?
[44:29.300 --> 44:37.000]  It just exploded overnight. We went from first there was one store South of Colorado Springs
[44:37.000 --> 44:43.660]  that was a dispensary and they were on the news every fucking night for like four months.
[44:43.660 --> 44:47.660]  And every night it was the same report where the guy was like, yeah, medical marijuana
[44:47.660 --> 44:53.360]  is a thing. You should be able to get it without being a good gardener. That's what
[44:53.360 --> 45:00.000]  I'm here for. Here's the weird bullshit thing we've come up with to pretend this is legal.
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.040]  And it sort of falls under the framework of Colorado's medical marijuana law, which was
[45:04.040 --> 45:11.640]  purposefully written to be a little bit confusing. Yep. And the news people were just a gas.
[45:11.640 --> 45:14.800]  You should go up and pull the footage. If you're interested, you'll laugh your ass off
[45:14.900 --> 45:19.740]  if you're not familiar with it. Do you remember the name of that? I know it's Michael Lee was
[45:19.740 --> 45:24.460]  the owner of the place, but do you remember the name of that dispensary? I can see the
[45:24.460 --> 45:28.860]  B roll footage of cars getting off the highway and pulling up in front of the building, but
[45:28.860 --> 45:39.460]  I've shopped there. For a while they were tracking plants. They were to sign like if
[45:39.460 --> 45:45.680]  you signed up there with them, for them to grow your medical plants, they would have
[45:45.680 --> 45:51.480]  six plants with your name tag on them. And they would try to track that bud all the way
[45:51.480 --> 45:56.880]  to a storage bin with your name on the front. And only you could come in and buy from that
[45:56.880 --> 46:04.720]  bin. It was so complicated. But it was one of those, you know, if the state ever is like,
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.780]  you know, you're really just a big drug dealer. You can say like, no patients and medical
[46:09.780 --> 46:14.580]  program. The caregiver program. That's what we operate intentions at Medamar. We tried
[46:14.580 --> 46:19.780]  to call it a caregiver program because like you said, we had, I was a grower. I was a
[46:19.780 --> 46:24.500]  caregiver there. I had Mike was a patient assigned to me. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, that
[46:24.500 --> 46:28.780]  means so I could do store runs. I'm a caregiver. Mike's a patient. He comes in. He's like,
[46:28.780 --> 46:32.900]  I can't grow weed, but you can. So I will assign you my plant count. Now I get Mike's
[46:32.920 --> 46:36.480]  medical marijuana card. He assigns me as the caregiver on the card. I get to grow his
[46:36.480 --> 46:40.980]  six plants. Now, every time he comes to my dispensary, since I'm growing his six plants,
[46:40.980 --> 46:43.960]  he gets medicine every time he comes because back in the day, it was hard to keep up with
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.840]  medicine. Also, if you sign us up as your caregiver, we'll give you bonuses and extras
[46:47.840 --> 46:51.560]  and gifts, which now is kind of frowned upon in the industry, but they've regulated that
[46:51.560 --> 46:54.760]  quite a bit. But yeah, so that's how that used to work back in the day. And then we
[46:54.760 --> 46:59.040]  just grow a shit ton of weed and wouldn't be a lot. Then they came up with vertical
[46:59.040 --> 47:04.700]  integration was one of the things that crushed a lot of the businesses. We had to back in
[47:04.700 --> 47:08.900]  the day, you could just buy it and get it from wherever. Now it had to come 70% of your
[47:08.900 --> 47:14.180]  product had to be produced by you in a cultivation facility that you were involved with. So you
[47:14.180 --> 47:20.500]  can only buy 30% outside product that messed up a lot of things. People that were just
[47:20.500 --> 47:24.700]  basement buccaneers like me had to quit doing our thing.
[47:24.700 --> 47:31.760]  The state spent a lot of years pretending like the medical marijuana industry didn't
[47:31.760 --> 47:38.760]  exist and waiting for the feds to step in and say it couldn't exist. And when that didn't
[47:38.760 --> 47:49.040]  happen, they sort of went around the state and created a list of the things that most
[47:49.040 --> 47:56.740]  offended them and got together and sort of compared lists. And the stuff that went to
[47:56.740 --> 48:06.020]  the top of that list, they just obliterated. Sign spinning is specifically explicitly
[48:06.020 --> 48:14.900]  prohibited by anyone in the dispensary or cannabis industry. If you put a sign spinner
[48:14.900 --> 48:18.880]  in front of your place, like little Caesars does, they go, shit.
[48:18.880 --> 48:22.900]  I think they should allow those because those are the best signs of like low quality weed.
[48:22.900 --> 48:27.000]  If you're spinning a fucking sign for a $5 gram, that tells me don't fucking shop there.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.200]  That's straight up what that means to me.
[48:31.200 --> 48:38.800]  No advertising, no windows to the sales floor. For a while, they wanted to pass a rule that
[48:38.800 --> 48:47.860]  the dispensary had to be negatively air pressured so that when the doors opened, no stinky pot air
[48:47.860 --> 48:53.740]  would escape on towards the sidewalk. It would be sucked into the building through some sort
[48:53.740 --> 48:58.420]  of high end filtration system. And it's funny because they didn't understand that carbon
[48:58.420 --> 49:04.300]  filters are a thing. And so they didn't just say carbon filters. They were talking about it like
[49:04.300 --> 49:06.300]  it's a fucking bio weapons lab.
[49:06.800 --> 49:09.800]  Because they think carbon filters make CO2 when they look at them.
[49:09.800 --> 49:20.800]  But that first, I really think it was 2010. Colorado legitimately went from a thousand
[49:20.800 --> 49:25.800]  retail locations to 500 within a couple of months.
[49:25.800 --> 49:29.800]  Well, then after the vertical integration, don't let me interrupt you. I apologize. Keep going.
[49:30.300 --> 49:37.300]  Vertical integration was a big piece of that. The 70-30 rule is only now finally fully being dissolved.
[49:37.300 --> 49:46.300]  And on the one hand, it's an incredibly profitable business model if you can get it right.
[49:46.300 --> 49:51.300]  But on the other hand, it's a fucking nightmare from start to finish.
[49:51.300 --> 49:55.300]  Yeah. That's like saying that 7-Eleven can only sell 7-Eleven products.
[49:55.800 --> 49:58.800]  But now they don't have Doritos and fucking Coke in there.
[49:58.800 --> 50:01.800]  And that's the, you need Doritos and Coke in your 7-Eleven or it doesn't work.
[50:01.800 --> 50:06.800]  If the jacket store has to be good at raising cows, like it just gets too fucking complicated.
[50:06.800 --> 50:08.800]  Yeah. Yep. Exactly.
[50:08.800 --> 50:14.800]  But then I think the next thing that really fucked everything up and made a lot of the mom and pop,
[50:14.800 --> 50:19.800]  the bro style shops. And I loved them. Those shops, it was like you and me working there.
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.800]  Like walking, like, what's up, bro? I got this fucking cush. You're going to love it, bro.
[50:23.800 --> 50:26.800]  You got dreads and shit. I'll give it to you for cheaper because you're cool, bro. Here you go.
[50:26.800 --> 50:31.800]  Like I miss those shops. Those were so fun. Now it's like, welcome to the dispensary. It's all plasticky.
[50:31.800 --> 50:34.800]  I went to one place and they made me take the fucking tour.
[50:34.800 --> 50:37.800]  I was like, no, I want the concentrates. I could see them on that shelf.
[50:37.800 --> 50:40.800]  Like, well, over here we do this. Follow me for the rest of the tour.
[50:40.800 --> 50:43.800]  And I was like, you're wasting my fucking time. I don't care about your tour.
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.300]  But the next thing that I think ruined us was the cameras and everything.
[50:48.300 --> 50:51.300]  It's a good idea, but nobody could afford it.
[50:51.300 --> 50:58.800]  Like you have to upgrade your security system in six months to have a camera on every square foot of your cultivation retail.
[50:58.800 --> 51:04.300]  Yeah. So if I go here, you have to be able to see me at two angles. If I go here, two angles.
[51:04.300 --> 51:12.300]  I know one dispensary owner that at that point they shut their marijuana store down and opened up a security business.
[51:12.300 --> 51:14.300]  Probably the smartest.
[51:14.300 --> 51:20.300]  They literally shifted gears to, well, this is dumb and way too expensive. I can't afford it.
[51:20.300 --> 51:26.800]  But like I can be the sales manager who sells the other 12 business owners. I know the cameras they need.
[51:26.800 --> 51:30.300]  Yeah. That's probably the smartest move he could have made. Shout out to that guy.
[51:30.300 --> 51:38.800]  Down here, they immediately added the first one of the first things they did.
[51:38.800 --> 51:45.300]  They added regulations saying you had to improve the property above and beyond building code.
[51:46.300 --> 51:51.300]  And you had to beautify the parking lot, the curb, the sidewalk, all the way to the street.
[51:51.300 --> 52:00.300]  And it's all of a sudden, instead of just being able to find a retail location, make a deal with the landlord, say, okay, now I've got a $3,000 a month rent.
[52:00.300 --> 52:06.300]  Put together a storefront, buy a big gun safe, bolt it to the floor in the back.
[52:07.300 --> 52:13.300]  Buy a couple pounds of weed from a friend of yours who grows and open a business.
[52:13.300 --> 52:20.300]  All of a sudden, can't do that anymore. Now you need $400,000 to improve the parking lot.
[52:20.300 --> 52:27.300]  You need another $200,000 to put in the security system and the new wall they want between the safe and the what the fuck.
[52:27.300 --> 52:28.300]  And then licensing.
[52:28.300 --> 52:33.300]  The licensing became super ridiculously expensive for a little while.
[52:33.300 --> 52:34.300]  All those costs pushed out.
[52:34.300 --> 52:39.300]  The way I put it is all the people that had soul got pushed out by all the people with money.
[52:39.300 --> 52:40.300]  And you could watch.
[52:40.300 --> 52:42.300]  There were dispensaries in Denver I would go to.
[52:42.300 --> 52:44.300]  We would stand in fucking line to get product.
[52:44.300 --> 52:48.300]  We knew that every the second Friday of every month, this one strain came out.
[52:48.300 --> 52:49.300]  You could buy seven grams.
[52:49.300 --> 52:51.300]  I would take the vortex.
[52:51.300 --> 52:52.300]  I would take, yeah.
[52:52.300 --> 52:53.300]  Then there was another spot.
[52:53.300 --> 52:55.300]  Yeah, we would line up for that.
[52:55.300 --> 53:00.300]  And then when all these new rules happened, all those places fell off and we watched the quality decline.
[53:00.300 --> 53:02.300]  The availability is through the roof.
[53:02.300 --> 53:06.300]  There was never more herb, but I didn't fucking want any of it.
[53:06.300 --> 53:09.300]  It just turned all to shit really quickly with all those rules.
[53:09.300 --> 53:18.300]  So a couple of places, they specifically pushed out anybody without large capital behind them.
[53:18.300 --> 53:22.300]  They had requirements like you had to have $400,000 in an escrow account.
[53:22.300 --> 53:23.300]  Yeah.
[53:23.300 --> 53:27.300]  Our city of Pueblo was going to pass that rule.
[53:27.300 --> 53:30.300]  And so I pointed out that we weren't allowed access to banks.
[53:31.300 --> 53:35.300]  And so you were just insisting we all had a duffel bag with $400,000.
[53:35.300 --> 53:37.300]  They wanted to do $200,000 down here.
[53:37.300 --> 53:44.300]  A duffel bag with $200,000 in it that we just like I guess showed the inspector when they came by to check.
[53:44.300 --> 53:46.300]  And what's the purpose of that money?
[53:46.300 --> 53:48.300]  Like what is that sitting there for?
[53:48.300 --> 53:55.300]  Their original intent was if we got sued for being a weed business.
[53:55.300 --> 53:56.300]  A weed business, yeah.
[53:57.300 --> 53:59.300]  A drug.
[53:59.300 --> 54:01.300]  What's the fucking phrase?
[54:01.300 --> 54:05.300]  If somebody got sick from something they got from you, you'd have to have some sort of backup plan.
[54:05.300 --> 54:12.300]  There's an official legal term for running a property where people consume drugs.
[54:12.300 --> 54:13.300]  And I'm spacing the name.
[54:13.300 --> 54:15.300]  A drug den?
[54:15.300 --> 54:18.300]  Essentially, yeah, it's a drug den law.
[54:18.300 --> 54:24.300]  But it was essentially an insurance fund in case you got sued because, I don't know,
[54:24.300 --> 54:28.300]  somebody bought something from your store and then plowed into somebody on the way home.
[54:28.300 --> 54:30.300]  It was just nonsense.
[54:30.300 --> 54:40.300]  And one of my favorite people down here in city government fought really hard every time somebody brought up an insane rule like that.
[54:40.300 --> 54:47.300]  She would like, do we have this rule for florists or the oil change place or the shooting range?
[54:47.300 --> 54:49.300]  Then why do we want to do it for pot?
[54:50.300 --> 54:55.300]  And if the only answer she was given was because it's pot, she would say, well, then fuck off.
[54:55.300 --> 54:57.300]  That's the way to do it.
[54:57.300 --> 55:05.300]  I don't think it should be treated like, if you don't treat it like a ridiculous drug that's super fucking druggy, then it's not a drug that's super druggy.
[55:05.300 --> 55:09.300]  If we treat it like alcohol and cigarettes are widely accepted.
[55:09.300 --> 55:14.300]  Nowadays, I kind of think it's cool that if you see somebody walking around with a cigarette, people look at them like they're a dipshit because they're slowly killing themselves.
[55:14.300 --> 55:16.300]  And I love it that we look at them condescendingly.
[55:16.300 --> 55:20.300]  But if they want to enjoy a cigarette or a beer, do your thing, have a good time.
[55:20.300 --> 55:23.300]  We don't treat it like it's the devil and it's some fucking crazy drug.
[55:23.300 --> 55:29.300]  I think if cannabis was treated like that on all levels, like politically, physically, what's the word I'm looking for?
[55:29.300 --> 55:31.300]  Financially, there's another word, economically.
[55:31.300 --> 55:32.300]  That's the word I'm thinking.
[55:32.300 --> 55:33.300]  Yeah, all of those things.
[55:33.300 --> 55:38.300]  If we just treated it just like this bottle of water, dude, I want one, I could buy one.
[55:38.300 --> 55:43.300]  Since we don't treat it, if I made water illegal, now people might shoot me for it.
[55:43.300 --> 55:44.300]  People might steal it from me.
[55:44.300 --> 55:48.300]  But since there's so many of them here, not at everywhere.
[55:48.300 --> 55:55.300]  So if I went somewhere where there aren't a lot of these, drop me off in the desert in the middle of some fucking third world country where they don't have this, it's a totally different story.
[55:55.300 --> 55:56.300]  They're going to shoot me for it.
[55:56.300 --> 55:57.300]  They're going to kill me.
[55:57.300 --> 56:00.300]  They're going to dismember me and take it from me because there isn't any there.
[56:00.300 --> 56:02.300]  So you get the point, dude.
[56:02.300 --> 56:07.300]  When that shit's legal, if it's just like bananas, nobody gives a fuck about bananas because they can get them.
[56:07.300 --> 56:08.300]  They're there.
[56:08.300 --> 56:10.300]  We don't treat them like they're weird.
[56:11.300 --> 56:15.300]  There's a million, million reasons why cannabis should be legal.
[56:15.300 --> 56:17.300]  It's insane.
[56:17.300 --> 56:21.300]  The more you look at it, the more insane it seems that it's illegal.
[56:21.300 --> 56:23.300]  We're getting there, though, bro.
[56:23.300 --> 56:24.300]  We're getting there.
[56:24.300 --> 56:25.300]  So many states are on board.
[56:25.300 --> 56:27.300]  So many countries are on board.
[56:27.300 --> 56:28.300]  Five more.
[56:28.300 --> 56:30.300]  I feel bad because I didn't prep and check.
[56:30.300 --> 56:32.300]  Like five more with the most recent origin.
[56:32.300 --> 56:34.300]  We're way off on a side tangent here.
[56:34.300 --> 56:38.300]  This has nothing to do with edibles anymore other than the fact that I'm high as fuck off some edibles.
[56:39.300 --> 56:41.300]  That's what the people want.
[56:41.300 --> 56:43.300]  They like it when we ramble.
[56:43.300 --> 56:44.300]  We're glazed.
[56:44.300 --> 56:46.300]  Rasta Jeff and White Mike 2024.
[56:46.300 --> 56:48.300]  They like it when we ramble.
[56:50.300 --> 56:51.300]  We're getting there.
[56:51.300 --> 56:56.300]  I think there's only six or eight states left that don't have some sort of quality cannabis access law.
[56:56.300 --> 56:57.300]  That's awesome.
[56:57.300 --> 57:01.300]  Either a medical program that basically anyone can join if they want or something.
[57:01.300 --> 57:07.300]  I can't wait till I can just drive from Colorado out to California, pick up a couple friends, and then drive out to New York.
[57:07.300 --> 57:12.300]  And we all have a fat bag of herb, our dabs, all of it with us, and nobody worries about anything.
[57:12.300 --> 57:15.300]  I can travel some again, man.
[57:15.300 --> 57:20.300]  For a while it was like, all right, so weed's legal in Colorado and Washington State.
[57:20.300 --> 57:24.300]  And I don't want to go to Seattle, so I can't travel.
[57:26.300 --> 57:29.300]  But now there's plenty of places with legal herb.
[57:29.300 --> 57:32.300]  Our medical marijuana cards are good in New Mexico now.
[57:32.300 --> 57:35.300]  So New Mexico is a reciprocal state.
[57:35.300 --> 57:37.300]  If you want to go down and check out Meow.
[57:37.300 --> 57:40.300]  If COVID ever ends, we can travel and enjoy herb in many places.
[57:40.300 --> 57:42.300]  I might just be happy enough just to be able to go places.
[57:42.300 --> 57:44.300]  I don't even care if we can smoke weed places now.
[57:44.300 --> 57:49.300]  My introverted ass is going to be excited to have plans when this shit is over.
[57:49.300 --> 57:52.300]  Yeah, dude, all of the events that we should normally be attending,
[57:52.300 --> 57:57.300]  this would be the couple of months where I would be preparing for the next two or three large events that come,
[57:57.300 --> 58:00.300]  and they're not coming, and I feel really weird for that.
[58:01.300 --> 58:05.300]  We should be worn out from whatever dumb Halloween event we just did.
[58:05.300 --> 58:10.300]  Right. Yep. Yep. I didn't get to wear my Chewbacca costume this year.
[58:15.300 --> 58:19.300]  We're pushing up on Thanksgiving. We just canceled all that.
[58:22.300 --> 58:24.300]  It's one of the reasons I was so excited.
[58:24.300 --> 58:27.300]  I was like, oh, you're doing an edible show? Fuck, I want in.
[58:27.300 --> 58:29.300]  I won't make time for this shit.
[58:31.300 --> 58:33.300]  Let's get some more content out there.
[58:33.300 --> 58:36.300]  I know a lot of people are in the same boat I am, where it was,
[58:36.300 --> 58:40.300]  I just had to fucking cancel Thanksgiving. I don't want to think about that shit.
[58:40.300 --> 58:45.300]  Let's get those two glazed and shit into a podcast.
[58:45.300 --> 58:48.300]  Our family had the canceled Thanksgiving talk.
[58:48.300 --> 58:49.300]  We just had that a couple of days ago.
[58:49.300 --> 58:52.300]  We all called and like, hey, we'll think we're going.
[58:52.300 --> 58:53.300]  And they're like, no, we expected that.
[58:53.300 --> 58:54.300]  And I was like, oh, really?
[58:54.300 --> 58:55.300]  And they're like, yeah, we bought containers.
[58:55.300 --> 58:58.300]  And I was like, oh shit. So everybody gets to go meals.
[58:58.300 --> 59:03.300]  I'm going to send, one person's going to go around and pick them up and take them to everybody.
[59:03.300 --> 59:06.300]  So it works out pretty well for our family.
[59:06.300 --> 59:10.300]  My wife likes to host. She loves to have people over.
[59:10.300 --> 59:13.300]  She loves to put plates of food in front of people she loves.
[59:13.300 --> 59:16.300]  It's like one of her core personality traits.
[59:16.300 --> 59:21.300]  And the last house we lived in before this was a great home,
[59:21.300 --> 59:24.300]  but it was not a home where you could host people.
[59:24.300 --> 59:27.300]  It was just not designed. There wasn't a dining room space.
[59:27.300 --> 59:30.300]  We didn't have a table space.
[59:30.300 --> 59:38.300]  And especially when we had a four-year-old and a one-year-old, there was just no fucking room.
[59:38.300 --> 59:43.300]  Like unless we want to sit on the floor all crisscross style with our plates in our laps,
[59:43.300 --> 59:46.300]  we can't have more than four people over at once.
[59:46.300 --> 59:51.300]  And so when we found this place, that was like her main criteria for house shopping.
[59:51.300 --> 59:54.300]  What's Thanksgiving going to be like?
[59:54.300 --> 59:58.300]  And for this year to be like, no, we're going to cancel show all summer.
[59:58.300 --> 01:00:02.300]  She's been staring it down just like, nope, it'll be over by Thanksgiving.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:07.300]  I'm having Thanksgiving. I don't care what happens. We're doing Thanksgiving.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:12.300]  And when she came to me on her own and was like, we should cancel, I was super proud of her.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:15.300]  But also like super heartbroken for her too.
[01:00:15.300 --> 01:00:18.300]  Just get a bunch of cardboard cutouts, bro, like all the sports are doing.
[01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:24.300]  I think she's got a local family scheduled to come by and get a plate.
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:28.300]  And she's just going to have go plates ready at the end of the driveway.
[01:00:28.300 --> 01:00:31.300]  That's cool. That still feels good.
[01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:34.300]  And I get turkey sandwiches, so I'm happy as fuck.
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.300]  Yeah. Happy holiday time.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:42.300]  I should not be ripping this pen, but it's delicious.
[01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:45.300]  These are dangerous people.
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:48.300]  I didn't really want to eat more of that edible because it was delicious,
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.300]  but you could see how heavy my eyes have gotten through this episode.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:55.300]  This has been fun. I got the bright lights, but I didn't have to talk into the camera.
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:58.300]  I like talking to you. I love the new camera, but talking to it feels,
[01:00:58.300 --> 01:01:01.300]  I'm just talking to the camera. So it feels really weird.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:05.300]  It was fun to have somebody to ramble back at me in this episode.
[01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:10.300]  Yeah. I figured out how I like to have the camera sick so I can pay attention to you
[01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:17.300]  and follow the show rather than way over analyzing whatever I'm broadcasting to the world.
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:20.300]  I try not to even look at myself. I'm distracting.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.300]  I check on my eyes occasionally because I feel they're heavy.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.300]  But yeah, I mainly try to just look at you over here.
[01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:28.300]  I can only imagine what my fucking eyes look like this episode.
[01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.300]  I am glazed as shit from those gummies.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.300]  You got the glasses stuffing behind. I don't even have a hat on today.
[01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.300]  I got the dreads out of the way.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.300]  See, he just hides eyes.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.300]  Just doing it.
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.300]  All right, bro. I feel like we're getting off course here and super rambly.
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.300]  So unless you've got any more super wise words of wisdom,
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.300]  let's wrap it up and let these fine people get back to their days,
[01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.300]  get back to their lives, get back to whatever else they were doing.
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.300]  We'll get out of their ears for a moment.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.300]  You got anything left to say for these kind folks that are listening and watching?
[01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:55.300]  Thank you so much for watching and listening.
[01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.300]  Hit us up on social media. Ask us questions.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.300]  And one more time, how do they do that, Mike?
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.300]  How do they find you on the social media?
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.300]  You can find me at Twitter at Nemopunk15.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:10.300]  You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:15.300]  I'm shadow banned, so you got to search that one a little bit harder than you might otherwise have to.
[01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:19.300]  Because Facebook censors cannabis related content.
[01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:26.300]  Everyone from the podcast, I never give out my Instagram, but they always find me there.
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.300]  It's at Nemopunk15 on Instagram too.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.300]  I've tagged you in a couple of things. They're finding you now.
[01:02:32.300 --> 01:02:38.300]  And you can hit me up on Patreon. It's patreon.com.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:40.300]  I was going to prompt that one for you. Good job.
[01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.300]  I think that's all of them.
[01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.300]  I think you got them all. You can find the Grow From Your Heart podcast on Instagram.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.300]  I'm trying to post more there. I don't post enough.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:51.300]  Check out ireee underscore genetics on Instagram.
[01:02:51.300 --> 01:02:53.300]  Actually, check out my website, ireeegenetics.com.
[01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:55.300]  Everything you need is there.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:58.300]  The YouTube channel is there. All of the social media stuff is there.
[01:02:58.300 --> 01:03:00.300]  The web store to buy shirts and gear is there.
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.300]  All of the vendors for ireee genetics are there.
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:05.300]  You mentioned the store. The store is dope.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:11.300]  Yes. By the time this episode comes out, there will be more of the original ireee genetics OG logo shirts up there.
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:15.300]  So grab those. There are like six designs of t-shirts up there.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:17.300]  By the time you look, this will be awesome.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.300]  Where else was I headed?
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:21.300]  Oh, the edibles are working, if you wondered.
[01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:24.300]  I think I may go for 10 more milligrams, but I'm going to need a snack.
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.300]  And then we'll take some dabs and see how the night wraps up.
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.300]  Social media, the website. That's what I was going to say.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.300]  Find us on the website, ireeegenetics.com.
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.300]  Also, let me know what you think of the website.

[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:38.300]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.300]  If you've got questions, corrections, comments, or concerns,
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:45.300]  the email address is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:47.300]  I think I said everything correctly.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:48.300]  I think I got it all covered.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.300]  Mike, thank you again for hanging out, bro.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.300]  Oh, yeah, man. Thanks for having me.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.300]  Yeah, dude. We'll get you back on more episodes.
[01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:59.300]  Oh, it's all me. My schedule is insane right now.
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:05.300]  COVID with two kids in the house, we're going back into restrictions.
[01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.300]  Yes, we are.
[01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:10.300]  My day starts at 7 a.m. It ends at 10 p.m.
[01:04:10.300 --> 01:04:15.300]  And if there's energy left for anything, it's pretty mind-numbing.
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:17.300]  Way past 10 now. So, thank you, brother.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:19.300]  All right, guys. We're going to wrap up the show.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:22.300]  That's when the kids crash, bro. That's when I'm at work.
[01:04:24.300 --> 01:04:26.300]  I don't have the energy of those boys.
[01:04:26.300 --> 01:04:28.300]  I wish I had the energy of one of those two boys.
[01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:31.300]  I don't, and that's why I'm not on the podcast as much as I want to be.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.300]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.300]  All right. We'll get you back, Mike.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:36.300]  Let me know whenever you're free.
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:38.300]  Send a text. Say, hey, 30 minutes, I'm on the show,
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:41.300]  and I'll make sure to get cleaned up and get on here for you.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.300]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes,
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:45.300]  friends and foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:49.300]  Paul and Chuckers, Karens and Beckys, Chads and Brads.
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:51.300]  Who else do I got for you? I don't know who else to mention.
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.300]  Everybody out there listening in podcast world,
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:56.300]  I want to thank you again for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:57.300]  We look forward to your feedback.
[01:04:57.300 --> 01:05:01.300]  Let us know what you thought of this edible episode, the high rambles we gave you.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:04.300]  We do appreciate the feedback.
[01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.300]  I think that's all we've got for you.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:06.300]  I covered all my notes.
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:07.300]  Thanks again to Mike.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.300]  Thanks to you for listening.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:10.300]  Check us out on the YouTube channel,
[01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:13.300]  and let's give a giant shout out to our friend, Kurt Z.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.300]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
