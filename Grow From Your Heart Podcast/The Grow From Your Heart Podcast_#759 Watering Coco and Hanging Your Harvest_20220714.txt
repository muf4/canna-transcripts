[02:07.030 --> 02:11.550]  But big thanks to everybody who did participate in the 4th of July sale.
[02:11.550 --> 02:16.450]  Also, this is the part of the show where I invite you to the DGC Growers Cup.
[02:16.450 --> 02:17.450]  That's right.
[02:17.450 --> 02:21.990]  The Dude Grows crew is throwing a Growers Cup July 30th in Fort Collins, Colorado, and
[02:21.990 --> 02:23.510]  you are cordially invited.
[02:23.510 --> 02:28.630]  Make sure you check out dudegrows.com for all of the information, for tickets, for details,
[02:28.630 --> 02:29.630]  for more information.
[02:29.630 --> 02:33.790]  Once again, that is dudegrows.com.
[02:33.790 --> 02:38.090]  In the last episode, I did mention that I was experiencing a power outage the day before,
[02:38.090 --> 02:41.910]  and I thought it was kind of silly that I did not talk at all about precautions and
[02:41.910 --> 02:45.710]  measurements taken during a power outage in my grow space.
[02:45.710 --> 02:48.890]  So that's something I want to ramble about here for just a little bit.
[02:48.890 --> 02:52.310]  One of the first things I want to recommend is if you think you may, even if you don't
[02:52.310 --> 02:56.270]  think you're going to experience a power outage, you probably will at some point.
[02:56.270 --> 03:00.930]  So to prevent problems when those power outages do come, one thing that I would highly recommend
[03:00.930 --> 03:05.430]  for your grow, and I do a lot of things quite highly, speaking of being quite highly today,
[03:05.430 --> 03:08.870]  I did take some dabs of some Lemon Jeffrey Concentrates made by a friend.
[03:08.870 --> 03:12.950]  We can't talk too much about who made it or how it got here, but we can talk about how
[03:12.950 --> 03:13.950]  much it wrecked me.
[03:13.950 --> 03:17.350]  I feel a little bit goofy, a little bit off in a very good way.
[03:17.350 --> 03:18.670]  I'm not complaining about it.
[03:18.670 --> 03:21.110]  It feels like I got pleasantly punched right in the face.
[03:21.110 --> 03:24.610]  I feel like I got a pie shoved right in my face and I'm just over here dazed and confused
[03:24.610 --> 03:25.610]  by it.
[03:25.950 --> 03:28.690]  The lights are super bright, but it doesn't matter because I can't pay attention to anything
[03:28.690 --> 03:30.730]  except what's directly in front of me.
[03:30.730 --> 03:34.170]  So the camera and the screen here, that's basically all I can focus on.
[03:34.170 --> 03:35.170]  Thought I should mention that.
[03:35.170 --> 03:37.570]  Anyway, back to my recommendations here.
[03:37.570 --> 03:42.750]  I highly recommend that in your grow, in any grow space, if you anticipate or do not anticipate
[03:42.750 --> 03:48.170]  the power going out, I highly recommend a timer that has a backup battery in it.
[03:48.170 --> 03:51.170]  That way, a lot of you have that timer that plugs directly into the wall.
[03:51.170 --> 03:53.010]  Then you plug your light into that.
[03:53.010 --> 03:55.370]  You spin the dial and set the time correctly.
[03:56.130 --> 03:58.570]  You push the up and down knobs to show you when you want it off and on.
[03:58.570 --> 04:03.050]  Then it just turns and the things click accordingly, goes off and on as you set it.
[04:03.050 --> 04:05.170]  What happens when the power goes out?
[04:05.170 --> 04:09.930]  If you have a timer with a battery backup in that timer, the time keeps spinning.
[04:09.930 --> 04:14.250]  So when the power does come back on in your building, facility, home, office, wherever
[04:14.250 --> 04:18.650]  the grow may be, then it gets right back on its regularly scheduled program.
[04:18.650 --> 04:23.450]  It doesn't miss any time other than what it was out naturally that you couldn't prevent.
[04:23.450 --> 04:27.890]  If you don't have that battery backup on your timer, the power in your facility goes
[04:27.890 --> 04:31.370]  off, the power to the timer goes off and it quits turning.
[04:31.370 --> 04:35.370]  So when it comes back on, now it is whatever time it, when the power went out, let's just
[04:35.370 --> 04:37.450]  say it was right now it's five 56.
[04:37.450 --> 04:42.370]  If it was five 56, when the power went off, it'll be five 56 for the entire duration of
[04:42.370 --> 04:43.690]  your power outage.
[04:43.690 --> 04:45.650]  When it comes back on, it's five 56.
[04:45.650 --> 04:49.170]  Again, my lights come on at nine and go off at nine.
[04:49.170 --> 04:50.710]  It's not going to be proper anymore.
[04:50.950 --> 04:54.590]  If my lights are off for one, if the power is out for an hour, I'm an hour off.
[04:54.590 --> 04:56.790]  If I'm out for two hours, I'm two hours off.
[04:56.790 --> 04:58.710]  It's not going to be a perfect hour duration.
[04:58.710 --> 05:00.590]  I promise you nothing in life works that way.
[05:00.590 --> 05:04.150]  It's going to be like an hour and 47 minutes and then your timers are going to be all fucked
[05:04.150 --> 05:05.150]  up.
[05:05.150 --> 05:07.950]  Some things will come back on and they'll reset themselves.
[05:07.950 --> 05:10.110]  Some things won't even come back on.
[05:10.110 --> 05:14.630]  So to make sure that timer comes on and stays on the regular schedule, which you had it,
[05:14.630 --> 05:19.030]  I would recommend a timer with the backup battery, especially for your lights.
[05:19.030 --> 05:21.990]  You need the lights to stay on a very critical schedule.
[05:21.990 --> 05:24.150]  Let's talk a little bit about the lights.
[05:24.150 --> 05:27.390]  It is okay to interrupt the day cycle.
[05:27.390 --> 05:31.550]  If your lights are on and you need to turn them off for an hour to spray, uh, maybe an
[05:31.550 --> 05:35.370]  hour and a half to apply a spray application, then turn them back on.
[05:35.370 --> 05:36.370]  That is okay.
[05:36.370 --> 05:39.810]  Or if the power goes out for an hour and a half while the lights are on, that is okay.
[05:39.810 --> 05:44.230]  There won't be a problem if there are interruptions in the day cycle.
[05:44.230 --> 05:49.190]  What will freak your plants out is if there are interruptions within the night cycle.
[05:49.190 --> 05:50.190]  Think about it this way.
[05:50.190 --> 05:52.550]  Uh, you are down to take a nap during the day.
[05:52.550 --> 05:54.110]  Most of us go, I'll take a nap during the day.
[05:54.110 --> 05:55.110]  That's not going to piss me off.
[05:55.110 --> 05:56.710]  You tell me you got to go lay down for an hour.
[05:56.710 --> 05:58.070]  I'll take a dab, grab my phone.
[05:58.070 --> 05:59.070]  We'll go to lay down for an hour.
[05:59.070 --> 06:00.470]  I don't really want to, but I mean, we'll do it.
[06:00.470 --> 06:01.470]  You know, that's cool.
[06:01.470 --> 06:02.470]  It's a good excuse.
[06:02.470 --> 06:03.470]  Get some fucking rest.
[06:03.470 --> 06:06.550]  However, if you wake me up in the middle of the night by turning some lights on and fucking
[06:06.550 --> 06:09.270]  up my sleep cycle, I'm going to be kind of annoyed.
[06:09.270 --> 06:11.110]  The plants have the same idea with life.
[06:11.110 --> 06:14.910]  You don't want to interrupt the dark cycle, but it's okay to interrupt the day cycle with
[06:14.910 --> 06:15.910]  darkness.
[06:15.910 --> 06:19.910]  When you interrupt that nighttime cycle, that's when you really do increase the opportunity
[06:19.910 --> 06:24.070]  to encourage the intersex trait that could be in that plant.
[06:24.070 --> 06:27.190]  So one thing I recommend if you don't have the backup battery timer, as soon as your
[06:27.190 --> 06:32.350]  power does come back on, get everything back on that regularly scheduled program as soon
[06:32.350 --> 06:33.970]  as possible.
[06:33.970 --> 06:35.630]  Sometimes the power goes out when you're not home.
[06:35.630 --> 06:37.610]  Maybe you're at work, maybe you're away.
[06:37.610 --> 06:40.270]  Maybe it went off and came back on and you don't even know it.
[06:40.430 --> 06:43.870]  Go check all of your timers occasionally just to make sure that things are in sync the way
[06:43.870 --> 06:45.010]  that you think they are.
[06:45.010 --> 06:47.030]  This could prevent a lot of problems.
[06:47.030 --> 06:50.270]  When you're walking around the grow looking for pests to see if there's any bugs present
[06:50.270 --> 06:53.870]  in the room, when you're looking for other problems, just look and see are all of the
[06:53.870 --> 06:57.050]  timers on the time, which I think they are set for.
[06:57.050 --> 07:00.350]  Another thing I should mention, if the power is going to be, if they're going to be working
[07:00.350 --> 07:04.590]  on the power, let's just say that hypothetically that the transformer behind your house blew
[07:04.590 --> 07:08.310]  up and it went out and then they came and they got the new transformer up.
[07:08.430 --> 07:11.310]  Every couple of minutes it's like they're plugging it in and unplugging it and plugging
[07:11.310 --> 07:13.030]  it in and unplugging it.
[07:13.030 --> 07:15.950]  Just fucking with it to see if it works as they hook it up.
[07:15.950 --> 07:17.590]  Touch the wire, don't touch the wire.
[07:17.590 --> 07:21.230]  The power in the house allegedly may have been going off and on randomly while that
[07:21.230 --> 07:25.750]  was happening and you could hear the fans go.
[07:25.750 --> 07:28.670]  They would just start up and they would die and you could see the light flicker.
[07:28.670 --> 07:31.630]  It would come on and as soon as it would get to full power, the lights would die again
[07:31.630 --> 07:33.550]  and it was happening throughout the whole house.
[07:33.550 --> 07:35.950]  But the main concerning part was the grow space.
[07:35.950 --> 07:39.190]  If you're going to have things like that happening, just go unplug all of the grow
[07:39.190 --> 07:40.190]  stuff.
[07:40.190 --> 07:42.110]  Just go and do the lights, go and do the air conditioner.
[07:42.110 --> 07:46.990]  It's not good for your equipment or your plants to get that sort of weird random schedule
[07:46.990 --> 07:48.470]  abuse sort of shit.
[07:48.470 --> 07:50.370]  Just leave it dark for a little while.
[07:50.370 --> 07:51.510]  It's basically free.
[07:51.510 --> 07:55.430]  It's not going to cause you any problems unless you get big humidity spikes or something,
[07:55.430 --> 07:58.310]  but you're just going to have to deal with that when the power comes back on.
[07:58.310 --> 08:02.630]  So if it's going crazy randomly and you're getting power off and on a lot, just go unplug
[08:02.630 --> 08:06.270]  it so that you don't blow up any bulbs, blow up any ballast, cause any problems with your
[08:06.270 --> 08:07.270]  equipment.
[08:07.270 --> 08:08.350]  It's easier on the gear.
[08:08.350 --> 08:12.830]  It's easier on your plants just to go unplug all your shit and put it back on when everything
[08:12.830 --> 08:13.950]  is fixed.
[08:13.950 --> 08:14.950]  Don't undo the timers.
[08:14.950 --> 08:17.470]  Leave the timers plugged in right where they are, especially if you've got timers with
[08:17.470 --> 08:19.690]  the backup battery, they'll be fine.
[08:19.690 --> 08:22.030]  Unplug from the timers, pull the cords out.
[08:22.030 --> 08:23.030]  I got a big power box.
[08:23.030 --> 08:24.510]  I just unplugged the power box.
[08:24.510 --> 08:27.190]  Everything is all undone at that point.
[08:27.190 --> 08:28.430]  Don't overload your breakers.
[08:28.430 --> 08:29.510]  Here's a very important thing.
[08:29.510 --> 08:31.590]  This is not related to just a random power outage.
[08:31.590 --> 08:34.350]  This is related to everything when you're growing.
[08:34.350 --> 08:35.850]  Don't overload the breakers.
[08:35.850 --> 08:37.590]  Don't put too many amps in one breaker.
[08:37.590 --> 08:38.830]  Don't do silly shit.
[08:38.830 --> 08:41.690]  If the breaker is flipping too often, that's a warning.
[08:41.690 --> 08:45.570]  If you keep fixing that breaker, the breaker, hopefully the breaker will burn out.
[08:45.570 --> 08:49.270]  If not, the other option is that either the outlet, the plug in which you are plugging
[08:49.270 --> 08:54.570]  your overloaded device into probably a thousand watt HPS light in a bedroom or two lights
[08:54.570 --> 08:56.630]  in a bedroom is probably what you're trying to do.
[08:56.630 --> 08:58.570]  You're going to keep flipping that breaker.
[08:58.570 --> 09:01.610]  Hopefully the breaker flips and burns out inside the breaker box.
[09:01.610 --> 09:04.270]  That's going to be a big sign that says, hey, quit fucking doing this.
[09:04.270 --> 09:08.050]  Your other option is that the inlet, the outlet, the plug in where you plug in the light, that
[09:08.050 --> 09:09.290]  could catch on fire.
[09:09.290 --> 09:12.550]  The other option is that the wires melt and catch on fire and cause a short somewhere
[09:12.550 --> 09:15.930]  else in the house, which could cause another fire.
[09:15.930 --> 09:16.930]  Don't overload shit.
[09:16.930 --> 09:20.470]  Overloading things electrically will definitely cause the risk of fire.
[09:20.470 --> 09:22.950]  The more electricity, the more potential of the fire.
[09:22.950 --> 09:27.810]  The older the house, the more potential for older bad wiring, the more potential for shitty
[09:27.810 --> 09:30.610]  breaker, shitty sockets, more potential for disaster.
[09:30.610 --> 09:31.610]  So pay attention.
[09:31.610 --> 09:35.370]  Don't be that guy or girl that burns down the house growing cannabis.
[09:35.370 --> 09:37.690]  Please let's not be that person.
[09:37.690 --> 09:41.970]  There's already enough bad publicity, enough bad shit on the news about cannabis growers.
[09:41.970 --> 09:43.650]  Let's not be those people.
[09:43.650 --> 09:47.130]  Speaking of being those people, if you're going to grow, have a smoke alarm, have a
[09:47.130 --> 09:49.970]  fire extinguisher ready and understand how to use them.
[09:49.970 --> 09:53.230]  And when the battery goes out and that smoke alarm, don't just take it down.
[09:53.230 --> 09:54.230]  It's going to beep at you.
[09:54.230 --> 09:55.230]  It's going to be so annoying.
[09:55.230 --> 09:57.450]  It's going to beep right in the middle of a podcast and piss you off.
[09:57.450 --> 09:59.770]  Don't go tear it off the ceiling and smash it.
[09:59.770 --> 10:00.770]  Put a battery in it.
[10:00.770 --> 10:01.830]  Make sure it works.
[10:01.830 --> 10:02.830]  Save your life.
[10:02.830 --> 10:03.830]  Save your family.
[10:03.830 --> 10:04.830]  Save the home.
[10:04.830 --> 10:05.830]  Also save the neighbors.
[10:05.830 --> 10:06.830]  Save your image.
[10:06.830 --> 10:07.830]  Save our reputation.
[10:07.830 --> 10:08.830]  All right.
[10:08.830 --> 10:11.450]  So I think that's enough on catching up talking about power outages.
[10:11.450 --> 10:15.610]  I felt it was a very good opportunity to talk about that since the power was going out here,
[10:15.610 --> 10:17.570]  was out here for several hours.
[10:17.570 --> 10:18.810]  It was kind of frustrating.
[10:18.810 --> 10:21.450]  Imagine being at home with just no electricity.
[10:21.450 --> 10:23.290]  Felt like a caveman with no power here.
[10:23.290 --> 10:26.370]  Had to grab the phone, plug the phone in and the car to charge it up and just go drive
[10:26.370 --> 10:27.810]  around and listen to music.
[10:27.810 --> 10:29.410]  Luckily, it was a beautiful night.
[10:29.410 --> 10:30.410]  Little bit of rain.
[10:30.410 --> 10:31.410]  Nice and cool.
[10:31.410 --> 10:32.410]  Now I'm just fucking rambling.
[10:32.410 --> 10:35.490]  Shout out to my friend who sent me the lemon Jeffrey.
[10:35.490 --> 10:39.290]  Another thing I want to talk about, this is just a random thing that I have observed over
[10:39.290 --> 10:40.290]  the past few days.
[10:40.290 --> 10:41.290]  I've been driving a lot.
[10:41.290 --> 10:44.650]  If you pay attention to my social media, my life at all, if you're included, you know
[10:44.650 --> 10:47.010]  that I have been driving a lot.
[10:47.010 --> 10:49.490]  I went through an oil change in like four weeks.
[10:49.490 --> 10:50.750]  So I need an oil change already.
[10:50.750 --> 10:51.750]  It's only been four weeks.
[10:51.750 --> 10:53.050]  I just remembered I needed an oil change.
[10:53.050 --> 10:55.070]  I'm glad we said that out loud.
[10:55.070 --> 10:56.790]  Something I've noticed, I've got some shoulder pain.
[10:56.790 --> 11:00.990]  I think it might be from driving because when I go like this, I can feel right about here.
[11:00.990 --> 11:02.110]  It doesn't feel so good.
[11:02.110 --> 11:03.110]  Not a big deal.
[11:03.110 --> 11:04.110]  It's not killing me.
[11:04.110 --> 11:08.710]  But you ever notice that sometimes when you smoke, if you've got pain, that sometimes
[11:08.710 --> 11:09.710]  it makes the pain go away.
[11:09.710 --> 11:10.710]  It feels really good.
[11:10.710 --> 11:15.350]  But have you ever smoked and felt the pain just completely throb or get worse?
[11:15.350 --> 11:17.510]  That's something that I've experienced lately.
[11:17.510 --> 11:19.630]  One night I smoked a whole bunch.
[11:19.630 --> 11:20.870]  I ate a bunch of edibles and smoked.
[11:20.870 --> 11:21.870]  The shoulder felt great.
[11:21.870 --> 11:24.870]  Next night, took a couple of dabs and I was like, here's where it hurts.
[11:24.870 --> 11:27.030]  And it just started throbbing right there.
[11:27.030 --> 11:28.030]  Really weird experience.
[11:28.030 --> 11:29.790]  I wondered if you guys have that.
[11:29.790 --> 11:31.110]  I thought I'd ramble and share.
[11:31.110 --> 11:32.110]  Also another question.
[11:32.110 --> 11:37.630]  Do you guys go through that phase where I do this, where I can smoke all of the dabs
[11:37.630 --> 11:40.750]  on the planet and eat all of the edibles on the planet and not get lit?
[11:40.750 --> 11:43.790]  And then also I have some days where I could take like two dabs and I'm like, I'm so
[11:43.790 --> 11:45.470]  lit I need to take a nap.
[11:45.470 --> 11:46.470]  Just curious.
[11:46.470 --> 11:47.470]  Send me a message.
[11:47.470 --> 11:51.310]  GrowFromYourHeartAtHotMail.com or hit me up on Twitter at GFYH Podcast.
[11:51.750 --> 11:56.190]  Do you have phases where you can smoke all the buds, all the herbs, all the flowers,
[11:56.190 --> 11:59.030]  eat all the edibles, smoke all the concentrates and not get super lit?
[11:59.030 --> 12:01.550]  And then do you have other times where it flips?
[12:01.550 --> 12:04.950]  Where just looking at the jar will get you too high to manage your own business?
[12:04.950 --> 12:05.950]  Let me know what you think.
[12:05.950 --> 12:06.950]  All right.
[12:06.950 --> 12:08.670]  I did say I was going to answer some emails in here.
[12:08.670 --> 12:10.750]  I got super rambly here at the start of the show.
[12:10.750 --> 12:12.190]  Once again, shout out to Lemon Jeffrey.
[12:12.190 --> 12:13.190]  All right.
[12:13.190 --> 12:17.030]  The first email on today's show comes from a friend who would rather remain anonymous
[12:17.030 --> 12:19.310]  and the question goes a little bit like this.
[12:19.310 --> 12:20.630]  It says, yo, Rasta Jeff.
[12:20.630 --> 12:21.630]  Thanks for all you do.
[12:21.630 --> 12:24.470]  Bro, thank you for listening and thank you for the great question.
[12:24.470 --> 12:26.550]  It says, my question is this.
[12:26.550 --> 12:29.190]  Why do we dry our plants upside down?
[12:29.190 --> 12:32.310]  Is this just for convenience or is there another purpose?
[12:32.310 --> 12:36.270]  It seems to me it would be easier to trim them if they were dried upright.
[12:36.270 --> 12:38.390]  I'd like to remain anonymous, please.
[12:38.390 --> 12:39.390]  Thanks again.
[12:39.390 --> 12:40.630]  Thank you for the great question.
[12:40.630 --> 12:44.470]  I do feel like I've got a really good solid answer for this.
[12:44.470 --> 12:45.590]  We do cut down the plants.
[12:45.590 --> 12:46.630]  We hang them upside down.
[12:46.630 --> 12:49.030]  We let them hang until they're dry enough to start chopping up.
[12:49.030 --> 12:50.950]  At that point, we trim them up.
[12:50.950 --> 12:53.590]  Then we get them into jars and actually start the curing process.
[12:53.590 --> 12:55.470]  Why do we hang them?
[12:55.470 --> 13:00.550]  In my opinion, in my experience, hanging them, first of all, is the most convenient.
[13:00.550 --> 13:03.110]  It is really easy and it takes the least amount of space.
[13:03.110 --> 13:08.470]  But also, if we were to put our buds on a shelf or a rack or a table, there's going
[13:08.470 --> 13:09.470]  to be a bottom.
[13:09.470 --> 13:13.230]  There's going to be a flat spot on whatever we set that bud down on.
[13:13.230 --> 13:16.150]  A lot of people will use like a ... It's a little drying rack.
[13:16.150 --> 13:17.470]  It's a hanging drying rack.
[13:17.470 --> 13:21.670]  It's really a weed hammock, a weed hotel, if you will, to dry the buds in.
[13:21.670 --> 13:24.430]  It's a mesh hanger that the plant sits in.
[13:24.430 --> 13:29.070]  Those are cool because they're kind of bouncy, but they also create a flat spot on the bottom
[13:29.070 --> 13:31.390]  of the bud that doesn't dry properly.
[13:31.390 --> 13:36.190]  I like to hang it because then the entire plant is exposed to the airflow, the air,
[13:36.190 --> 13:37.190]  all evenly.
[13:37.190 --> 13:38.750]  Then we get an even dry throughout the whole plant.
[13:38.750 --> 13:41.190]  We don't get a flat spot that looks ugly.
[13:41.190 --> 13:43.390]  We don't get a bottom that's not getting dry.
[13:43.390 --> 13:45.590]  It doesn't change the shape and appearance of our buds.
[13:45.710 --> 13:50.190]  I think it is ... Not only is it really convenient, it makes it super easy.
[13:50.190 --> 13:51.190]  They're just hanging all up.
[13:51.190 --> 13:52.350]  You don't need a bunch of shelf space.
[13:52.350 --> 13:54.630]  You can run a bunch of lines and just hang them.
[13:54.630 --> 13:58.150]  That's super convenient, but also then they dry more evenly.
[13:58.150 --> 13:59.590]  There's no flat spot.
[13:59.590 --> 14:00.590]  Nothing's touching.
[14:00.590 --> 14:01.590]  They're suspended.
[14:01.590 --> 14:05.150]  It prevents the opportunity for mold and other issues.
[14:05.150 --> 14:07.910]  You did say that you would prefer to dry them standing up.
[14:07.910 --> 14:12.030]  The problem is unless you're hanging them from the tip, which is a bud, which is a part
[14:12.030 --> 14:13.550]  you don't really want, you could hang it from the top.
[14:13.550 --> 14:15.030]  You could figure out how to do it.
[14:15.630 --> 14:16.630]  They're going to fall over.
[14:16.630 --> 14:18.910]  They're just going to tip over unless you hang it from the top.
[14:18.910 --> 14:19.910]  Flip it upside down.
[14:19.910 --> 14:20.910]  It'll hang that way.
[14:20.910 --> 14:22.430]  The leaves will go this way.
[14:22.430 --> 14:23.790]  You said it would probably be easier to trim.
[14:23.790 --> 14:27.230]  I cut off a lot of the leaf before we even get to that point.
[14:27.230 --> 14:31.770]  While the plant is still growing the day before harvest, I go in and pull off a good portion
[14:31.770 --> 14:35.870]  of any big leaf, any leaf with a petiole, it comes off at this point.
[14:35.870 --> 14:38.350]  Those leaves aren't even in the room for the dry and cure process.
[14:38.350 --> 14:39.350]  Those are already gone.
[14:39.350 --> 14:43.310]  I take those all off, chop it upside ... Chop it, hang it upside down.
[14:43.350 --> 14:47.710]  A few days later, bust all the buds off of the sticks, then go cut off all the leaves,
[14:47.710 --> 14:51.230]  then give it a final trim, then finish the final dry and cure.
[14:51.230 --> 14:55.590]  We hang it upside down because it makes it more evenly dry.
[14:55.590 --> 15:01.310]  There will be some weird wives' tales, some hippie stories about draining the resin from
[15:01.310 --> 15:03.190]  the bottom of the plant to the top.
[15:03.190 --> 15:04.550]  That doesn't have anything to do with it.
[15:04.550 --> 15:05.550]  That's all a myth.
[15:05.550 --> 15:06.870]  That's all bro science.
[15:06.870 --> 15:12.550]  That is fake because if that were true, then wouldn't just all the THC come to just the
[15:12.550 --> 15:14.910]  main top bud, which is now at the very bottom.
[15:14.910 --> 15:15.910]  That's not real.
[15:15.910 --> 15:18.750]  It is because it dries more evenly.
[15:18.750 --> 15:19.750]  That is why.
[15:19.750 --> 15:20.750]  Great question.
[15:20.750 --> 15:21.750]  Thank you for that.
[15:21.750 --> 15:23.430]  I do look forward to follow-up questions.
[15:23.430 --> 15:26.910]  There is another question right here in the stack of emails.
[15:26.910 --> 15:29.610]  This question comes from our friend, Frosty the Plant Man.
[15:29.610 --> 15:31.790]  Big shout out to my dude, Frosty the Plant Man.
[15:31.790 --> 15:35.670]  It says, hey, would you be able to help on feeding in cocoa?
[15:35.670 --> 15:38.350]  I am using 7030 cocoa from Eco.
[15:38.350 --> 15:41.030]  Oh, also I should mention our friend is in the UK.
[15:41.030 --> 15:42.830]  I am not sure what they mean by Eco.
[15:42.830 --> 15:47.630]  That is probably peat moss or probably perlite.
[15:47.630 --> 15:50.310]  But either way, we're going to figure this out because it'll be similar answers.
[15:50.310 --> 15:52.830]  So they're using a 7030 mix, which is great.
[15:52.830 --> 15:57.490]  It says I see loads of different approaches with a once a day, once every other day or
[15:57.490 --> 15:58.830]  multiple times a day.
[15:58.830 --> 16:01.650]  Is there a correct method to watering cocoa?
[16:01.650 --> 16:04.890]  Also on the multiple feeds, would you look at getting runoff every feeding?
[16:04.890 --> 16:06.270]  The quick answer to that is yes.
[16:06.270 --> 16:09.750]  I want runoff on every single feeding when it comes to cocoa.
[16:09.750 --> 16:15.270]  I want 10 to 20% runoff, if not, maybe even a little bit more depending on how often and
[16:15.270 --> 16:16.750]  the size of the pots and more things.
[16:16.750 --> 16:18.590]  But yes, I do want runoff every time.
[16:18.590 --> 16:21.870]  So let's talk a little bit about feeding in cocoa.
[16:21.870 --> 16:22.870]  You're using cocoa.
[16:22.870 --> 16:24.570]  You got a 7030 base, which is great.
[16:24.570 --> 16:25.830]  That's what I recommend.
[16:25.830 --> 16:27.670]  I don't know what size pots you're using.
[16:27.670 --> 16:29.030]  I don't know if you're auto watering.
[16:29.030 --> 16:32.870]  I'm not sure about a couple of things here, but we can dial this in and figure this out.
[16:32.870 --> 16:36.310]  You're asking about how many times, how often you should be watering.
[16:36.310 --> 16:38.750]  That really depends on the dry down time.
[16:38.750 --> 16:42.470]  I would water to a 20% runoff.
[16:42.470 --> 16:45.150]  And then if you're able to do this, I don't know how often you're there.
[16:45.150 --> 16:46.590]  I don't know your availability.
[16:46.590 --> 16:49.670]  Maybe you've got a camera, but this is what I would do personally.
[16:49.670 --> 16:51.990]  I would go to the grow first thing in the morning.
[16:51.990 --> 16:55.830]  I would water to 20% runoff every single plant.
[16:55.830 --> 16:58.630]  Then I would set a timer and then I would watch the plants.
[16:58.630 --> 17:03.150]  And as soon as one or two of the plants start showing me, Hey, I'm kind of pissed off.
[17:03.150 --> 17:05.430]  I would hit my timer button or make a note.
[17:05.430 --> 17:09.510]  And I would say the first couple of plants start looking pissed off at this many hours.
[17:09.510 --> 17:13.990]  Then I would start paying attention to where the average of the room looks pissed off at
[17:13.990 --> 17:15.630]  a certain amount of hours.
[17:15.630 --> 17:19.030]  Then if you really want to get crazy, wait another hour or two and see how long it takes
[17:19.030 --> 17:21.510]  for plants to get really pissed off.
[17:21.510 --> 17:23.310]  We're doing this shit for science, right?
[17:23.310 --> 17:24.310]  Make a note of that.
[17:24.310 --> 17:25.310]  So you got to know it.
[17:25.310 --> 17:29.110]  And hypothetically, I'm going to make up some numbers because again, I'm not in your grow,
[17:29.110 --> 17:34.970]  your pot size, your VPD, your lighting, everything in this room is going to make a difference
[17:34.970 --> 17:39.930]  on how often you need to water, because it will make a difference on how quickly or slowly
[17:39.930 --> 17:42.810]  your pots, your medium, your containers do dry up.
[17:42.810 --> 17:44.090]  So I'm going to go with six hours.
[17:44.090 --> 17:47.850]  Let's just say, let's just say that right at the six hour market looked like the plants
[17:47.850 --> 17:51.090]  would have been really happy to get water again, the entire room.
[17:51.090 --> 17:55.250]  So if you're running multiple strains, if you can dial in multiple tables, do that.
[17:55.250 --> 17:57.250]  But let's just talk about the average of the room.
[17:57.250 --> 18:01.510]  Let's just say that right at six hours, all of the tables looked like it'd be perfect if
[18:01.510 --> 18:02.950]  we water them.
[18:02.950 --> 18:04.950]  So let's set that timer for six hours.
[18:04.950 --> 18:05.950]  And let's watch again.
[18:05.950 --> 18:07.790]  And let's time, let's water them.
[18:07.790 --> 18:10.790]  Then set a timer for six more hours and watch again.
[18:10.790 --> 18:12.750]  Do they go six hours again and need water?
[18:12.750 --> 18:13.810]  Guess what we just learned.
[18:13.810 --> 18:18.970]  We need to water them four times a day, six hours apart, water them to 20% runoff, wait
[18:18.970 --> 18:22.790]  six hours, water them again to 20% runoff and continue this.
[18:22.790 --> 18:28.670]  As the plants grow, they may need more frequent watering or they simply may need more water
[18:28.670 --> 18:29.670]  per watering.
[18:29.670 --> 18:32.630]  That's going to be things that you as the farmer need to dial in.
[18:32.630 --> 18:37.950]  I'm going to assume that when they get larger, if you're watering four times a day, late
[18:37.950 --> 18:42.350]  in veg, all the way through the end of flower, you may be hitting them six or eight times.
[18:42.350 --> 18:46.830]  It just depends on, like I said, the VPD of the room, the size of the container.
[18:46.830 --> 18:49.210]  If you're using four by four, you're using cocoa.
[18:49.210 --> 18:53.930]  So if you're using a six by six pot, you've got the opportunity to water fucking 20 times
[18:53.930 --> 18:56.150]  a day because that's not going to hold much water.
[18:56.150 --> 18:59.870]  If you're using a seven gallon pot, you're only going to water two times because, or
[19:00.110 --> 19:03.750]  maybe one time because there's going to be a lot of fucking water in there.
[19:03.750 --> 19:07.430]  In a commercial grow, I typically use three gallon pots.
[19:07.430 --> 19:10.590]  Some people want a five gallon pot just because owners are owners.
[19:10.590 --> 19:11.670]  I am a consultant.
[19:11.670 --> 19:17.910]  I am the cultivation director, but that doesn't mean that the whole team follows what I say
[19:17.910 --> 19:18.910]  every time.
[19:18.910 --> 19:22.230]  That's I wish, but humans are humans and owners are owners.
[19:22.230 --> 19:25.510]  So most of the time I'm using three gallon containers.
[19:25.510 --> 19:28.050]  I prefer either a three gallon fabric pot.
[19:28.050 --> 19:31.970]  If they don't want to pay for the three gallon fabric pot, we use a three gallon grow bag.
[19:31.970 --> 19:37.810]  That's my favorite way to go in a commercial grow with drip irrigation with one or two
[19:37.810 --> 19:40.150]  water emitters per plant.
[19:40.150 --> 19:43.450]  So I've got my three gallons of amended cocoa.
[19:43.450 --> 19:49.090]  I've got probably 70 to 75% cocoa with 25 to 30% perlite.
[19:49.090 --> 19:51.170]  I just like that airy fluffy mix.
[19:51.170 --> 19:54.790]  It lets me not over water is something that it helps me do.
[19:54.790 --> 19:58.130]  If there's too much water in there and not enough room for air, the roots can get crushed
[19:58.130 --> 19:59.130]  when they're little.
[19:59.130 --> 20:01.510]  As they get bigger, it's not as big of a deal, but I'd like it.
[20:01.510 --> 20:03.350]  It just does help me out for commercial growing.
[20:03.350 --> 20:05.670]  So I got my three gallon container.
[20:05.670 --> 20:09.110]  I got my 70 30 mix, my 75 25 ish mix.
[20:09.110 --> 20:10.790]  I got my two emitters.
[20:10.790 --> 20:15.230]  We water or I or they or it will get watered first thing in the morning.
[20:15.230 --> 20:18.310]  Like I said, as soon as we start up the grow, one of the first things we do is mix up the
[20:18.310 --> 20:20.350]  water and hit the big flower room.
[20:20.350 --> 20:23.750]  So that room will get watered first thing in the day.
[20:23.750 --> 20:25.590]  Then we got there at eight.
[20:25.590 --> 20:27.990]  Sometimes it depends on what facility.
[20:27.990 --> 20:30.630]  Usually going at eight, usually leave at six.
[20:30.630 --> 20:35.330]  I will check the plants around five o'clock and decide, do they need their second watering?
[20:35.330 --> 20:36.390]  These plants get big.
[20:36.390 --> 20:39.910]  I am not exaggerating when I say that in a commercial grow, you guys are going to think
[20:39.910 --> 20:40.910]  I'm crazy.
[20:40.910 --> 20:41.910]  I've got pictures.
[20:41.910 --> 20:43.590]  I can show you this and there are people that will testify.
[20:43.590 --> 20:47.190]  Mike was the metric guy, the guy in charge of all the numbers.
[20:47.190 --> 20:49.390]  When these plants are harvested, they are wet.
[20:49.390 --> 20:50.630]  This is their wet weight.
[20:50.630 --> 20:52.150]  Let me say that very clearly.
[20:52.150 --> 20:57.830]  This is the weight of the wet plants at harvest coming from a three gallon pot with most of
[20:57.830 --> 20:59.550]  the leaves defoliated.
[20:59.550 --> 21:04.710]  The plants would weigh somewhere between 2,000 and 3,000 grams.
[21:04.710 --> 21:06.870]  Those are big fucking plants.
[21:06.870 --> 21:09.590]  We were growing those in three gallon pots.
[21:09.590 --> 21:13.510]  Those would get watered at eight in the morning and 6 p.m.
[21:13.510 --> 21:15.830]  So that's about 12 hours apart, but we were leaving.
[21:15.830 --> 21:17.790]  We weren't going to be there at 8 p.m.
[21:17.790 --> 21:19.750]  So we're going to water them at 6 p.m.
[21:19.750 --> 21:21.790]  The lights are going to go out that dark period.
[21:21.790 --> 21:25.670]  It would buy us a couple of hours of not watering since they aren't as functional.
[21:25.670 --> 21:27.710]  The heat's not as high in the room.
[21:27.710 --> 21:29.070]  So we could water them at 8 p.m.
[21:29.070 --> 21:31.510]  They'd be ready for water again by about 6 p.m. or 7 p.m.
[21:31.510 --> 21:34.670]  We'd hit them at 5 p.m., 30 p.m. or 6 p.m. so we could clean up and go home.
[21:34.670 --> 21:35.670]  People got to go home.
[21:35.670 --> 21:36.670]  You can't be there all day.
[21:36.670 --> 21:37.670]  It's a commercial grow.
[21:37.670 --> 21:38.670]  We got to send people home.
[21:38.670 --> 21:39.670]  I got to get out.
[21:39.670 --> 21:40.670]  There's shit to do.
[21:40.670 --> 21:41.790]  I got to go to another grow probably.
[21:41.790 --> 21:44.630]  So we'd water them again at 6 p.m. and then we come back at 8 p.m.
[21:44.630 --> 21:45.830]  They're ready for water again.
[21:45.830 --> 21:47.590]  So that's a three gallon pot.
[21:47.590 --> 21:51.150]  In most of those facilities, we are running double-ended Goveda lighting.
[21:51.150 --> 21:53.390]  Those are, they say they're 1,100 watts.
[21:53.390 --> 21:57.950]  They're 1,000 watt lights, but they do put out a lot of heat, a lot of electricity, a
[21:57.950 --> 22:01.990]  lot of lumens, a lot of par watts, whatever you want to measure.
[22:01.990 --> 22:04.590]  Those plants are really growing and really cooking under those.
[22:04.590 --> 22:07.170]  So I'm watering twice in those.
[22:07.170 --> 22:10.550]  If your pots are smaller than three gallons, if you got a one gallon pot, you're looking
[22:10.550 --> 22:12.930]  at watering four to six times a day.
[22:12.930 --> 22:16.750]  You're not going to have big 3,000 gram plants come out of that, but you're still going to
[22:16.750 --> 22:18.150]  have to keep that medium wet.
[22:18.150 --> 22:22.270]  So the way that I would do it, I'm going to recap a little bit.
[22:22.270 --> 22:28.310]  The best way to do this is to turn on the water, water till you get runoff, 20% runoff,
[22:28.310 --> 22:30.830]  then stop watering, then set a timer.
[22:30.830 --> 22:33.670]  See how long you need to go between waterings.
[22:33.670 --> 22:37.030]  When the plants look like they need water again, make a note, look at your timer.
[22:37.030 --> 22:40.750]  It's been six hours, eight hours, repeat that process.
[22:40.750 --> 22:44.390]  Keep in mind that during the dark cycle, they may not drink as much water as they do during
[22:44.390 --> 22:45.590]  the day.
[22:45.590 --> 22:47.030]  You don't have as much heat to deal with.
[22:47.030 --> 22:48.810]  There's not as high of a VPD.
[22:48.810 --> 22:50.390]  They're putting out a little bit more water.
[22:50.390 --> 22:51.950]  They're not sucking up as much water.
[22:51.950 --> 22:55.710]  So you may not have to water as often during the night cycle.
[22:55.710 --> 22:59.750]  Maybe wise to stick around one night and just stick your finger in some pots and pick up
[22:59.750 --> 23:00.750]  some pots.
[23:00.750 --> 23:04.030]  Check out Water Tech 1-5.
[23:04.030 --> 23:05.230]  Also that's a really good episode.
[23:05.230 --> 23:09.150]  If you're growing in cocoa, Water Tech 1-5 is a really good episode.
[23:09.150 --> 23:11.790]  I can't think of the episode number off the top of my head.
[23:11.790 --> 23:15.710]  If you watch the video, the episode number will pop up right here.
[23:15.710 --> 23:18.310]  Also somebody will leave it in the comments for you.
[23:18.310 --> 23:20.710]  Water Tech 1-5, really good episode.
[23:20.710 --> 23:21.710]  Will help you out.
[23:21.710 --> 23:25.150]  I'll do it quickly because I'm not going to recap the entire episode.
[23:25.150 --> 23:28.550]  Let's just say that when you put your, you're using cocoa.
[23:28.550 --> 23:32.630]  This method works for cocoa, for soil, for soilless mix.
[23:32.630 --> 23:35.790]  This is how I teach people how to water the plants.
[23:35.790 --> 23:40.310]  Let's just say that you filled a pot with cocoa or with your mix, whatever gallon, let's
[23:40.310 --> 23:41.310]  see you got a three gallon.
[23:41.830 --> 23:43.550]  I'm going to use a three gallon pot for this example.
[23:43.550 --> 23:47.030]  We fill it with our mix and there's no water in it and you pick it up.
[23:47.030 --> 23:48.030]  That's a zero.
[23:48.030 --> 23:49.030]  You're fired.
[23:49.030 --> 23:50.030]  If the plant ever gets that dry, you're fired.
[23:50.030 --> 23:51.470]  You're going home.
[23:51.470 --> 23:55.270]  Then let's all the way water it, all the way until there's water fucking pouring out of
[23:55.270 --> 23:56.350]  that plant.
[23:56.350 --> 23:57.350]  That's a five.
[23:57.350 --> 23:58.790]  As heavy as it gets, pick it up.
[23:58.790 --> 23:59.790]  That's what I'm saying.
[23:59.790 --> 24:00.790]  Pick up this pot.
[24:00.790 --> 24:05.390]  If it is fucking sopping wet with water and it's super heavy, remember that weight.
[24:05.390 --> 24:06.390]  That's a five.
[24:06.470 --> 24:12.030]  Now when it dries up a little bit and it's more not soggy but just wet at the ideal condition
[24:12.030 --> 24:14.350]  for a plant, that's a four.
[24:14.350 --> 24:17.630]  Then it's going to dry up a little bit where you're going, we might need to water this
[24:17.630 --> 24:18.630]  soon.
[24:18.630 --> 24:19.630]  That's a three.
[24:19.630 --> 24:22.270]  Then when you get to the two where it's like, hey bro, are you going to water that fucking
[24:22.270 --> 24:23.270]  plant?
[24:23.270 --> 24:24.270]  That's a two.
[24:24.270 --> 24:26.030]  Number one is where it's bone dry and you're fired.
[24:26.030 --> 24:27.030]  I'm not going to ask you any questions.
[24:27.030 --> 24:28.350]  Go, what happened to that plant?
[24:28.350 --> 24:29.350]  Go home.
[24:29.350 --> 24:30.350]  That's how it's going to be.
[24:30.350 --> 24:31.350]  I guess I did ask a question.
[24:31.350 --> 24:32.350]  I asked, what the fuck happened?
[24:32.350 --> 24:33.350]  But I already know it got too dry.
[24:33.350 --> 24:34.350]  So guess what?
[24:34.350 --> 24:35.350]  Clock out.
[24:35.350 --> 24:36.350]  Go home.
[24:36.350 --> 24:37.350]  I'm not going to ask you questions.
[24:37.350 --> 24:38.350]  I'm just going to give you a little bit of an estimate.
[24:38.350 --> 24:39.350]  So water tech, one through five.
[24:39.350 --> 24:40.350]  Number one, it's bone dry.
[24:40.350 --> 24:41.990]  It's super light when you pick it up.
[24:41.990 --> 24:45.470]  Number two, it's got a little bit of weight to it when you pick it up, but the plant looks
[24:45.470 --> 24:47.070]  like it needs water.
[24:47.070 --> 24:49.070]  Number three, that's kind of the sweet spot.
[24:49.070 --> 24:52.590]  That's where you're like, oh, we should water it soon, but if we water it now it's too early.
[24:52.590 --> 24:53.790]  It can wait.
[24:53.790 --> 24:54.790]  That's number three.
[24:54.790 --> 24:59.230]  Number four is like, oh, it's almost over watered, but it's just right because we just
[24:59.230 --> 25:00.230]  watered it.
[25:00.230 --> 25:01.230]  Give it one hour.
[25:01.230 --> 25:02.230]  It's going to be perfect.
[25:02.230 --> 25:03.230]  Number five.
[25:03.230 --> 25:05.350]  It's like, bro, how much fucking water are you going to give that plant?
[25:05.350 --> 25:07.650]  So that's basically Water Tech 1-5.
[25:07.650 --> 25:13.250]  You want to hover right around number 3 like a 2.5 to a 3.5 is right in the sweet spot
[25:13.250 --> 25:14.250]  there.
[25:14.250 --> 25:16.610]  Number 5, the plants are struggling to get oxygen.
[25:16.610 --> 25:19.310]  Number 1, the plants are struggling to get water.
[25:19.310 --> 25:21.610]  So stay right in the middle there, get that beautiful balance.
[25:21.610 --> 25:24.210]  That is Water Tech 1-5 recapped.
[25:24.210 --> 25:25.450]  Let me get back on my notes here.
[25:25.450 --> 25:27.050]  Let me get myself back on track.
[25:27.050 --> 25:29.290]  I know I did get quite rambly once again.
[25:29.290 --> 25:31.810]  Shout out to my friend with the Lemon Jeffrey Concentrate.
[25:31.810 --> 25:34.690]  That shit got me all weird today.
[25:34.690 --> 25:36.050]  Help me feeding in cocoa.
[25:36.050 --> 25:37.050]  I think I covered that.
[25:37.050 --> 25:38.770]  People, different approaches.
[25:38.770 --> 25:39.930]  Once every other day.
[25:39.930 --> 25:42.170]  Definitely not every other day unless you got big pots.
[25:42.170 --> 25:45.010]  I think I gave you advice on how to figure that out.
[25:45.010 --> 25:49.210]  You do want runoff with every single watering.
[25:49.210 --> 25:54.690]  Even if you are watering multiple times a day, I would recommend you do get runoff every
[25:54.690 --> 25:55.690]  time.
[25:55.690 --> 25:57.830]  If not, the salts will build up in that cocoa.
[25:57.830 --> 25:59.690]  Some things will stick in the cocoa.
[25:59.690 --> 26:01.010]  Other things will not.
[26:01.010 --> 26:04.350]  And then when you go to water, you think you're feeding one thing but you're actually not
[26:04.510 --> 26:08.470]  because there's other shit just sitting in the soil or in the cocoa or whatever.
[26:08.470 --> 26:11.110]  And then it will get absorbed the next time you water.
[26:11.110 --> 26:14.870]  You'll be doubling up your PPMs of something and not even realize it.
[26:14.870 --> 26:15.870]  There's more.
[26:15.870 --> 26:17.230]  It does say another question.
[26:17.230 --> 26:19.130]  I don't mind answering another question.
[26:19.130 --> 26:20.130]  The first one was free.
[26:20.130 --> 26:21.630]  I will bill you for this one.
[26:21.630 --> 26:22.630]  Check for an invoice.
[26:22.630 --> 26:29.190]  It says, is there a reason why I can feed my cocoa with a 5.8 pH feeding to check runoff?
[26:29.190 --> 26:31.790]  And sometimes it'll be as low as 5.0.
[26:31.790 --> 26:35.950]  Would there be a reason or is something not to worry about?
[26:35.950 --> 26:40.430]  This is a really good question and I don't know if you're gonna like my answer.
[26:40.430 --> 26:47.270]  My answer is, if you ask me this in person, if you're like, bro, why is my runoff 5.0?
[26:47.270 --> 26:48.470]  And I'd say, well, what did you feed it?
[26:48.470 --> 26:49.470]  And he'd say 5.8.
[26:49.470 --> 26:54.990]  And then my next question is gonna be, are you growing runoff or are you growing ganja
[26:54.990 --> 26:55.990]  plants?
[26:55.990 --> 26:57.950]  My next question would be, how did the plants look?
[26:57.950 --> 26:59.670]  Like, are the plants happy?
[26:59.670 --> 27:02.310]  If the plants look good, I don't worry about the runoff.
[27:02.310 --> 27:09.150]  I do document the runoff, but it doesn't concern me until I see a problem with the plants.
[27:09.150 --> 27:12.010]  I only use the runoff as a clue.
[27:12.010 --> 27:15.870]  Like I said, if there's a problem, I don't change anything based on the runoff.
[27:15.870 --> 27:17.350]  I look at the plants first.
[27:17.350 --> 27:19.990]  Here's a rant that I don't know if I've done this on a podcast.
[27:19.990 --> 27:20.990]  I don't know.
[27:20.990 --> 27:23.710]  I know I've said this like on Instagram Live and other shows.
[27:23.710 --> 27:25.350]  I don't know if I've done this here.
[27:25.350 --> 27:28.590]  Maybe it's time to just do it again because maybe you don't listen to every episode like
[27:28.590 --> 27:30.150]  I think people may.
[27:30.150 --> 27:35.990]  But I feel like the younger generation of growers, we have a lot of great toys.
[27:35.990 --> 27:41.470]  We've got...they have...we have a lot of great technology at our fingertips and it's very
[27:41.470 --> 27:42.790]  affordable now.
[27:42.790 --> 27:47.870]  So we can buy monitors, meters, gauges, buzzers, devices.
[27:47.870 --> 27:51.770]  Basically we can almost make the plants talk to us except we can't get that far.
[27:51.770 --> 27:53.530]  We can almost do it.
[27:53.530 --> 27:56.550]  We can get all the data that we need on a computer screen.
[27:56.550 --> 28:03.030]  So one thing that I think we're losing track of is when somebody says there's an issue
[28:03.030 --> 28:06.710]  with the plants, we go look at the computer screen and look at the meters, look at the
[28:06.710 --> 28:08.270]  monitors, which is cool.
[28:08.270 --> 28:11.190]  But what about looking at the plants?
[28:11.190 --> 28:16.030]  The plants are over there telling you almost everything you need to know.
[28:16.030 --> 28:17.750]  If the leaves are doing this, it means one thing.
[28:17.750 --> 28:19.590]  If the leaves are doing this, it means another thing.
[28:19.590 --> 28:23.070]  If the leaves are going like this, it definitely means another fucking thing.
[28:23.070 --> 28:24.830]  If they're this color, it means one thing.
[28:24.910 --> 28:27.870]  If they're this color, it means the other thing.
[28:27.870 --> 28:33.270]  We're forgetting that as humans, we've got a lot of powerful senses and we should use
[28:33.270 --> 28:37.870]  those senses first to identify what's going on with our plants.
[28:37.870 --> 28:43.990]  Some of the best cannabis I ever smoked was grown by people that did not have fancy meters.
[28:43.990 --> 28:48.830]  The most high-tech piece of shit that those people had was probably maybe a pH meter.
[28:48.830 --> 28:49.950]  I don't even think they had a timer.
[28:49.950 --> 28:53.230]  I think they were just unplugging shit and plugging it back in at the right time every
[28:53.230 --> 28:54.230]  day.
[28:54.630 --> 28:57.430]  Some of the best herb I smoked came from a very low-tech room.
[28:57.430 --> 29:00.790]  I have nothing against you guys that have all the great gear.
[29:00.790 --> 29:01.870]  I love all the great gear.
[29:01.870 --> 29:05.870]  I love it when I'm in a commercial grow and I'm in a meeting talking to management and
[29:05.870 --> 29:10.030]  something dings and I look at my phone and it says, oh, the CO2 ran out in room B. We
[29:10.030 --> 29:11.990]  got to go replace the CO2.
[29:11.990 --> 29:12.990]  How do you know that?
[29:12.990 --> 29:15.670]  I'm like, well, there's a sensor hanging in the middle of the room.
[29:15.670 --> 29:17.150]  It's not detecting any CO2.
[29:17.150 --> 29:21.230]  It's in an alert to my phone and now I know to go replenish the CO2 in that room.
[29:21.230 --> 29:22.870]  The meters are great.
[29:22.870 --> 29:24.630]  Our friend is worried about the runoff.
[29:24.630 --> 29:28.710]  He knows the pH and the EC of the runoff of what he's feeding.
[29:28.710 --> 29:30.350]  That's fucking cool.
[29:30.350 --> 29:33.310]  But did the plants tell you there's anything wrong with them?
[29:33.310 --> 29:35.410]  That's the main point of my ramble here.
[29:35.410 --> 29:37.510]  Let's look back at the plants.
[29:37.510 --> 29:41.270]  Let's get away from the computers, the monitors, the buzzers, the devices, and the gadgets,
[29:41.270 --> 29:47.150]  and let's get familiar with identifying problems and correcting things by looking at the plants.
[29:47.150 --> 29:51.190]  I guess what I'm trying to say is grow from your heart a little bit.
[29:51.190 --> 29:54.450]  Let's look at the plants first and see if we can figure it out.
[29:54.450 --> 29:59.110]  Then let's use the computers, the books, the devices, the internet, the web pages to help
[29:59.110 --> 30:01.110]  us out as a hint, as a confirmation.
[30:01.110 --> 30:05.790]  But let's go to the plant first, maybe pull out a grow book, then go to the internet.
[30:05.790 --> 30:09.110]  Then let's start looking at all the devices and seeing what we can do.
[30:09.110 --> 30:13.110]  Let's kind of build a story, not just ignoring the plants and looking at all the screens.
[30:13.110 --> 30:14.110]  I love screens.
[30:14.110 --> 30:15.450]  The more screens, the merrier.
[30:15.450 --> 30:16.950]  My office is filled with screens.
[30:16.950 --> 30:18.710]  I can't get enough of them.
[30:19.230 --> 30:22.830]  Sometimes the plants are telling you everything that they need.
[30:22.830 --> 30:28.190]  My main answer to this question is, if the plants don't look like they have a problem,
[30:28.190 --> 30:30.590]  why are you worried about the runoff?
[30:30.590 --> 30:33.030]  If there is a problem, message me back.
[30:33.030 --> 30:35.230]  Send me pictures of the plants.
[30:35.230 --> 30:40.170]  Also send me details about the pH that went in and the pH that came out for the last two
[30:40.170 --> 30:41.230]  weeks.
[30:41.230 --> 30:45.990]  If you can, send me details about the EC and what went into those plants, not just the
[30:45.990 --> 30:48.510]  pH for the past two weeks.
[30:48.510 --> 30:49.950]  Then I will review that.
[30:49.950 --> 30:52.670]  Then we will do more review and see if we can help you out.
[30:52.670 --> 30:54.910]  But if they look good, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
[30:54.910 --> 30:56.830]  That's what I think the bottom line is here.
[30:56.830 --> 30:58.670]  Dude, thank you for the great question.
[30:58.670 --> 30:59.670]  Thank you for the great email.
[30:59.670 --> 31:00.710]  I do appreciate it.
[31:00.710 --> 31:05.870]  And I look forward to hearing back from you if there are any issues with those plants.
[31:05.870 --> 31:11.150]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[31:11.150 --> 31:14.790]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,

[31:26.070 --> 31:27.510]  I feel like it's only been five minutes.
[31:27.510 --> 31:31.350]  I really have no clue how long I have been recording.
