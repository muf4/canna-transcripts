[02:19.600 --> 02:21.000]  server.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.080]  I do want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Mobius grows.
[02:24.080 --> 02:25.080]  What's up bro?
[02:25.080 --> 02:30.120]  Big shout out and big thank you for the great tester update report video.
[02:30.120 --> 02:31.120]  That's right.
[02:31.120 --> 02:33.040]  My buddy Mobius is testing some seeds for me.
[02:33.040 --> 02:34.440]  He's got some new seeds.
[02:34.440 --> 02:35.920]  He's running a test grow.
[02:35.920 --> 02:39.320]  And today I received a great email with a detailed video.
[02:40.160 --> 02:42.280]  He walks around the grow and he says, this is one phenotype.
[02:42.280 --> 02:43.280]  This is another.
[02:43.280 --> 02:45.200]  These are some traits each phenotype has.
[02:45.200 --> 02:46.320]  These are commonalities.
[02:46.320 --> 02:47.600]  These are differences.
[02:47.600 --> 02:48.600]  This is what I'm feeding.
[02:48.600 --> 02:49.600]  This is what I've done.
[02:49.600 --> 02:50.600]  This is what the room is like.
[02:50.600 --> 02:55.140]  It was like I was hanging out with my own plants and his grow, hanging out with my babies
[02:55.140 --> 02:58.080]  and his grow, hanging out with his babies and his grow.
[02:58.080 --> 02:59.680]  It was a great experience.
[02:59.680 --> 03:01.200]  That is great work from a tester.
[03:01.200 --> 03:02.200]  I do appreciate that.
[03:02.200 --> 03:03.360]  I love that sort of stuff.
[03:03.360 --> 03:06.680]  So if you're testing for me, please do send videos.
[03:06.680 --> 03:09.040]  It was like a FaceTime video with my kids or something.
[03:09.040 --> 03:10.040]  It's like, here's the babies.
[03:10.040 --> 03:14.040]  And I got to see the kids at play, playing in the playground with each other, looking
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.840]  beautiful, put a smile on my face.
[03:15.840 --> 03:17.640]  So Mobius, good work, bro.
[03:17.640 --> 03:18.640]  Big fist bump.
[03:18.640 --> 03:21.600]  I wish more testers would be like you.
[03:21.600 --> 03:23.160]  Let's segue right into this part.
[03:23.160 --> 03:25.720]  I will need more testers very soon.
[03:25.720 --> 03:29.680]  So if you've been sending me a tester applications, don't worry.
[03:29.680 --> 03:30.800]  Those are saved in a folder.
[03:30.800 --> 03:32.560]  I did not delete those, throw those away.
[03:32.560 --> 03:35.280]  They're all in a folder on the desktop.
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.080]  So whenever I need some testers, I just go right to the email, open up that folder, and
[03:39.080 --> 03:42.760]  I can find all the applicants in there, go through, find some good candidates that I
[03:42.760 --> 03:44.360]  think may be a tester.
[03:44.360 --> 03:49.960]  If you have not already applied to be a tester, there's a full episode about being a tester.
[03:49.960 --> 03:55.320]  Make sure you listen to that episode, then apply following the instructions within that
[03:55.320 --> 03:57.040]  episode.
[03:57.040 --> 04:00.240]  I did talk recently about Mephisto Genetics.
[04:00.240 --> 04:02.120]  I do need to make an update.
[04:02.280 --> 04:07.480]  Daz, the guy that I knew that I had a friendship with from Mephisto Genetics, has now started
[04:07.480 --> 04:09.760]  what is known as Night Owl Genetics.
[04:09.760 --> 04:15.480]  Make sure you check out Night Owl Genetics for your auto-flowering seeds needs.
[04:15.480 --> 04:17.680]  I do support Daz, great guy.
[04:17.680 --> 04:20.080]  So make sure you check them out if you're into the auto-flowers.
[04:20.080 --> 04:26.800]  All right, I do have a question here in front of me that I do want to address.
[04:26.800 --> 04:29.080]  This comes from a previous episode.
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.360]  In a previous episode, I read a question about a commercial grow whose plants were
[04:33.360 --> 04:34.360]  getting too tall.
[04:34.360 --> 04:39.600]  They weren't finishing on time, and people wanted to send me a lot of suggestions, a
[04:39.600 --> 04:42.120]  lot of ideas on what to do with this grow.
[04:42.120 --> 04:45.640]  We did receive a lot of great input, a lot of great ideas.
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.720]  However, there were a lot of small adjustments and small details that weren't going to make
[04:50.720 --> 04:57.480]  a big enough impact overall in this commercial grow to make it worth the time, energy, money,
[04:57.480 --> 04:59.800]  and effort to make those changes in this grow.
[04:59.800 --> 05:01.700]  This is a commercial environment.
[05:01.700 --> 05:06.120]  Think about if we're going to make a small adjustment in your grow, think about the time,
[05:06.120 --> 05:10.000]  energy, and cost it takes to make it in your grow, and then think if we're going to do
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.880]  that in a commercial environment, it costs 100 times the cost to do that.
[05:15.880 --> 05:19.440]  Because if you're doing it to one light, we're doing it to 100.
[05:19.440 --> 05:21.600]  We've got to repeat the process 100 times.
[05:21.600 --> 05:23.840]  We have to buy the equipment 100 times.
[05:23.840 --> 05:29.680]  We have to take the manpower or womanpower to install or adjust or adapt that new equipment.
[05:29.680 --> 05:30.840]  We have to test the equipment.
[05:30.840 --> 05:32.400]  We have to learn the equipment.
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.040]  It takes a lot of time to have people come in there, a lot of money, a lot of energy.
[05:36.040 --> 05:40.800]  And then in the long run, if you've got your personal grow with two, four, one, however
[05:40.800 --> 05:43.240]  many small lights you've got going, I'm not downplaying your grow.
[05:43.240 --> 05:45.760]  I'm saying your personal grow is a small grow.
[05:45.760 --> 05:46.760]  That's your grow.
[05:46.760 --> 05:50.120]  In a commercial environment, we're doing things on an exponential scale compared to what you've
[05:50.120 --> 05:52.520]  got going at home in most cases.
[05:52.640 --> 05:57.720]  In a commercial environment, we're getting very little return on our investment after
[05:57.720 --> 06:03.280]  staffing, after payroll, after the rent on the building, the electricity on the building,
[06:03.280 --> 06:09.520]  licensing, taxes, packaging, transportation fees, workman's comp lawyers, the lawyer,
[06:09.520 --> 06:13.200]  the accountant, all of that stuff eats into all of our profit.
[06:13.200 --> 06:18.280]  And hopefully, it's just you, your trimming partner, and hopefully the lawyer is all that
[06:18.280 --> 06:19.280]  you've got to pay.
[06:19.280 --> 06:21.160]  Hopefully, you've got that lawyer on retainer to take care of that.
[06:21.160 --> 06:24.360]  If you're growing, everybody growing should have a lawyer no matter what you're doing.
[06:24.360 --> 06:25.720]  I should have a lawyer anyway.
[06:25.720 --> 06:31.320]  But my point is that in a home grow, your return on investment is much greater, and
[06:31.320 --> 06:34.880]  our return on investment in a commercial grow is much smaller because we have much more
[06:34.880 --> 06:37.320]  expenses, many more expenses.
[06:37.320 --> 06:42.200]  So making small adjustments like that are much more costly than it would be in a small
[06:42.200 --> 06:43.200]  environment.
[06:43.200 --> 06:45.920]  We've got to repeat it 100 times if we have 100 lights.
[06:45.920 --> 06:51.440]  There were some great recommendations, things like changing the light spectrum and changing
[06:51.440 --> 06:57.000]  the temperature in the night, things like that that would help, but not to the degree
[06:57.000 --> 06:59.660]  which we need help in this commercial environment.
[06:59.660 --> 07:04.760]  Those plants were obviously being flowered, being veg for two or three weeks too long.
[07:04.760 --> 07:05.760]  They're getting too big.
[07:05.760 --> 07:07.680]  They just needed to be done sooner.
[07:07.680 --> 07:09.320]  We couldn't, it was a commercial environment.
[07:09.320 --> 07:11.200]  People said, raise the fans, raise the lights.
[07:11.200 --> 07:12.480]  It's a commercial grow, bro.
[07:12.480 --> 07:16.600]  We probably got three foot tall tables, 12 foot lights, 18 foot ceilings.
[07:16.600 --> 07:17.920]  We've maxed out with what we can do.
[07:17.920 --> 07:20.040]  We can't just raise the lights.
[07:20.040 --> 07:24.080]  We can't go around and put blue lights up everywhere.
[07:24.080 --> 07:25.080]  Then where's the profit?
[07:25.080 --> 07:27.160]  If you've got a commercial grow, then where did the profit go?
[07:27.160 --> 07:28.160]  There are 100 lights.
[07:28.160 --> 07:30.800]  You've got to replace half of them with blue bulbs.
[07:30.800 --> 07:32.080]  That's 50 bulbs you've got to buy.
[07:32.080 --> 07:33.440]  They're $100 each.
[07:33.440 --> 07:34.440]  You do the math on there.
[07:34.440 --> 07:35.440]  That's $5000.
[07:35.440 --> 07:36.560]  I know that's not a real number.
[07:36.560 --> 07:37.960]  I'm hoping you're paying attention.
[07:37.960 --> 07:42.080]  All right, so there were a lot of great ideas, but most of them are not feasible.
[07:42.680 --> 07:44.680]  The main solution to that is better scheduling.
[07:44.680 --> 07:46.200]  The plants were too big.
[07:46.200 --> 07:47.200]  We know they're too big.
[07:47.200 --> 07:48.720]  They're repeatedly too big.
[07:48.720 --> 07:49.720]  They're growing into the lights.
[07:49.720 --> 07:51.040]  They're growing into the fans.
[07:51.040 --> 07:54.360]  The easy, logical solution is flower earlier.
[07:54.360 --> 07:55.400]  Have smaller plants.
[07:55.400 --> 07:56.440]  Don't grow them so damn big.
[07:56.440 --> 07:57.440]  They're more manageable.
[07:57.440 --> 07:58.680]  They're healthy.
[07:58.680 --> 08:01.400]  Less time on the road is less time for a crash.
[08:01.400 --> 08:06.760]  Also, if those plants are only in the room for a total of like four weeks of veg and
[08:06.760 --> 08:11.120]  fucking nine weeks of flower, that's two or three weeks less opportunity for powdery mildew,
[08:11.160 --> 08:16.160]  spider mites, thrips, fungus gnats, overwatering, pH lockout, power failures, other weird shit
[08:16.160 --> 08:21.160]  to go on because in a commercial environment, all things that can go wrong will until you
[08:21.160 --> 08:24.280]  get the facility dialed in and everything is perfect.
[08:24.280 --> 08:28.000]  Things will go and then things will continue to go wrong because pumps will go out, power
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.840]  will fail, air conditioners will fail.
[08:30.840 --> 08:32.240]  Weird shit's gonna happen all the time.
[08:32.240 --> 08:33.440]  You've got to adjust and adapt.
[08:33.440 --> 08:35.360]  I've talked about that enough.
[08:35.360 --> 08:38.600]  So that's a good setup for this one message that I did get.
[08:38.600 --> 08:40.320]  I've been talking quite a bit.
[08:40.320 --> 08:44.440]  This one says, Rasta Jeff, question on what you said on not being able to shorten the
[08:44.440 --> 08:45.440]  flowering phase.
[08:45.440 --> 08:49.000]  Yes, on that episode I did say that we can't shorten the flowering phase.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.760]  The plants have to flower for their nine or 10 weeks until they're finished and that we
[08:52.760 --> 08:57.280]  should shorten the veg phase because then you just start with smaller plants.
[08:57.280 --> 08:59.320]  You don't grow them as big and they don't finish as big.
[08:59.320 --> 09:00.760]  It makes sense to me.
[09:00.760 --> 09:02.080]  But this one was a great question.
[09:02.080 --> 09:08.360]  It says, isn't that what new millennium winter frost claims to do on the Dude Grow Show?
[09:08.400 --> 09:12.240]  I think Jaren, the new millennium guy, said you can get different strains to finish at
[09:12.240 --> 09:13.800]  the same time.
[09:13.800 --> 09:18.920]  Yes, the new millennium product, the winter frost product from new millennium will cause
[09:18.920 --> 09:22.600]  the plants to go into their finishing stage a little more quickly.
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.640]  They will start ripening.
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.640]  They will go into senescence a little bit sooner when you feed them that product.
[09:27.640 --> 09:28.880]  They will be triggered.
[09:28.880 --> 09:30.840]  There's something in there that tells them, hey, it's the end.
[09:30.840 --> 09:34.200]  It's time to go to the end phase.
[09:34.880 --> 09:40.120]  Would you rather have a room that's proper or would you rather have to feed a product
[09:40.120 --> 09:42.960]  that is going to trigger the finishing?
[09:42.960 --> 09:46.920]  You could put a bandaid on it and spend all kinds of money on this product or you could
[09:46.920 --> 09:49.600]  fix the schedule and do it right.
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.400]  Also, this product isn't going to cut two or three weeks off.
[09:53.400 --> 09:57.800]  This may cut five, maybe seven days, maybe 10 at the most, but it's not going to cut
[09:57.800 --> 10:00.200]  that many days off your full cycle.
[10:00.200 --> 10:04.600]  The grow we were talking about, it sounded like they needed two, maybe three full weeks
[10:04.600 --> 10:06.440]  cut off of their process.
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.440]  That's a great idea to use the new millennium winter frost, but it's not going to be a drastic
[10:11.440 --> 10:12.960]  enough change.
[10:12.960 --> 10:16.320]  Speaking of drastic changes, here's another great thing we can talk about.
[10:16.320 --> 10:18.760]  Diurnal temperature swings.
[10:18.760 --> 10:22.360]  If we narrow down that swing, if we don't have more than five degrees between our day
[10:22.360 --> 10:27.560]  and night swing and maybe five or 10% humidity between our day and night swing, that will
[10:27.560 --> 10:30.920]  help with the stretch, that initial stretch into the flowering phase.
[10:30.920 --> 10:31.920]  That may help.
[10:31.920 --> 10:32.920]  That may be a way to do it.
[10:32.920 --> 10:37.880]  Popping and twisting the stems, cracking the branches, that may be one way to do it.
[10:37.880 --> 10:43.400]  But overall, the ultimate solution as the consultant who sees the overall problem as
[10:43.400 --> 10:47.360]  an experienced grower who's been in these commercial facilities, the answer to that
[10:47.360 --> 10:49.360]  was just flower earlier.
[10:49.360 --> 10:53.400]  Why are you going to grow 10 foot tall plants if you've only got a 14 foot ceiling?
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.040]  Grow five foot tall plants, flower them out.
[10:56.040 --> 10:57.040]  They'll be 10 feet tall.
[10:57.520 --> 10:58.880]  You've got four feet of extra space.
[10:58.880 --> 11:00.360]  Think ahead, plan ahead.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.760]  We talked about that before.
[11:01.760 --> 11:02.760]  Be successful.
[11:02.760 --> 11:03.760]  All right.
[11:03.760 --> 11:06.880]  Let me hit my notes here, recap myself, get myself back on track, make sure we're doing
[11:06.880 --> 11:07.880]  this right.
[11:07.880 --> 11:10.060]  Yes, question about winter frost.
[11:10.060 --> 11:11.060]  We covered that.
[11:11.060 --> 11:12.060]  Okay.
[11:12.060 --> 11:13.800]  Now, I do have more emails in front of me.
[11:13.800 --> 11:15.480]  Do I want to give this person a shout out?
[11:15.480 --> 11:16.940]  Do they want their name said?
[11:16.940 --> 11:21.120]  This one, they did not leave their name, but big shout out.
[11:21.120 --> 11:22.120]  You know who you are.
[11:22.120 --> 11:24.920]  Thank you for sparking great content.
[11:24.920 --> 11:26.080]  I do want to keep moving.
[11:26.120 --> 11:29.640]  I am awful rambly today, so I do need to keep myself on track.
[11:29.640 --> 11:30.640]  All right.
[11:30.640 --> 11:35.200]  I'm not sure if this message is trolling me or if this was 100% serious.
[11:35.200 --> 11:36.940]  I'm going to read it anyway.
[11:36.940 --> 11:39.920]  If you're trolling me, good job.
[11:39.920 --> 11:42.800]  And if you're not trolling me, listen this time.
[11:42.800 --> 11:43.800]  It goes on.
[11:43.800 --> 11:47.400]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, I'm growing a few of your strains and I'm just curious when
[11:47.400 --> 11:49.560]  to start counting flowering days.
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.760]  Do I start at light switch of 12-12 or when I start seeing pre-flowers?
[11:54.760 --> 11:55.760]  Then it goes on.
[11:55.760 --> 12:01.720]  And the best part, I heard on an episode that you said you start counting at the light switch.
[12:01.720 --> 12:03.160]  That's what I said, bro.
[12:03.160 --> 12:05.320]  I start counting at the light switch.
[12:05.320 --> 12:07.820]  Is this correct or should I add some weeks?
[12:07.820 --> 12:13.460]  Keep up the good work and I will continue to work with you and your company.
[12:13.460 --> 12:15.720]  My friend, Saul, you heard me right.
[12:15.720 --> 12:16.920]  I'm going to say it again.
[12:16.920 --> 12:25.840]  I always start counting flowering days on an indoor grow the day I flip the lights to 12-12.
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.400]  All right, I'm going to look into this camera, say it at another angle.
[12:29.400 --> 12:35.800]  I always, and I recommend you, always start counting flowering days in an indoor grow
[12:35.800 --> 12:39.440]  from the day you flip the lights to 12-12.
[12:39.440 --> 12:45.020]  If you do a unique, creative, fancy flowering light cycle like maybe 11-13 or something
[12:45.140 --> 12:52.260]  like that, start counting the day you change that timer to 12-12 or 11-13.
[12:52.260 --> 12:53.740]  That is day one of flower.
[12:53.740 --> 12:54.920]  Don't adjust that.
[12:54.920 --> 12:56.100]  Don't play with that.
[12:56.100 --> 12:57.800]  That is day one.
[12:57.800 --> 13:05.080]  Why would we put 63 days of flowering and then you start flowering on this day but then
[13:05.080 --> 13:07.860]  subtract 14 days or add 14 days?
[13:07.860 --> 13:10.140]  I didn't put a math problem on the package.
[13:10.140 --> 13:12.540]  It says nine weeks of flowering.
[13:12.580 --> 13:15.860]  The day you start flowering is day one.
[13:15.860 --> 13:19.220]  At the end of nine weeks, not at the start of nine weeks either.
[13:19.220 --> 13:20.980]  People say, I've got eight full weeks.
[13:20.980 --> 13:21.980]  I'm going to chop down tomorrow.
[13:21.980 --> 13:24.100]  I say, you've got the ninth week to go.
[13:24.100 --> 13:25.300]  They say week nine is tomorrow.
[13:25.300 --> 13:29.060]  I go, hey, you've got to finish that week.
[13:29.060 --> 13:30.580]  You've got to finish the ninth week.
[13:30.580 --> 13:37.220]  If it says nine to 10 weeks, let it go 10 completed weeks, 70 days.
[13:37.220 --> 13:39.620]  You've got to let it finish.
[13:39.700 --> 13:45.060]  The plants are going to take nine to 10 weeks from the day you flip that timer to 12-12.
[13:45.060 --> 13:51.260]  When you go in there and you change the timer from 9 p.m. on to 9 a.m. off, you are not
[13:51.260 --> 13:55.940]  12 hours off, 12 hours on in your 24-hour day.
[13:55.940 --> 13:58.100]  That is day one of flowering.
[13:58.100 --> 13:59.300]  Write it down.
[13:59.300 --> 14:01.220]  Take a screenshot on your phone.
[14:01.220 --> 14:06.540]  Make some sort of a note that says day one of flowering is today this day.
[14:06.660 --> 14:10.540]  Maybe get a piece of duct tape and write that date on the piece of duct tape and stick that
[14:10.540 --> 14:15.420]  duct tape on the door or possibly on the pot of the plant that you are flowering.
[14:15.420 --> 14:19.100]  Keep that note somewhere that you will find it that you will not forget.
[14:19.100 --> 14:20.380]  I've got weird OCD.
[14:20.380 --> 14:22.300]  I like to flower on the first.
[14:22.300 --> 14:26.660]  That way I know that in two months, the next first on that third month will be when I'm
[14:26.660 --> 14:27.660]  harvesting.
[14:27.660 --> 14:32.100]  If I start flowering January 1st, we've got all of January, we've got all of February.
[14:32.100 --> 14:34.140]  March 1st, I've got to crop.
[14:34.140 --> 14:38.580]  That means that a little bit before March 1st, I need to get my next crop coming up.
[14:38.580 --> 14:41.620]  Just planning, thinking like that.
[14:41.620 --> 14:43.260]  I've been going on for a long time about this.
[14:43.260 --> 14:45.300]  I don't know how many times I can say it.
[14:45.300 --> 14:50.180]  I don't know how else to stress it.
[14:50.180 --> 14:54.320]  Flowering day one starts the day that you flip the timer to 12-12.
[14:54.320 --> 14:56.440]  If you're outdoors, that's a different environment.
[14:56.440 --> 14:57.440]  That's a different thing.
[14:57.440 --> 14:59.940]  We don't know when we change the timer to 12-12.
[14:59.940 --> 15:01.380]  Then pay attention to your trichomes.
[15:01.380 --> 15:02.420]  Pay attention to the plants.
[15:02.420 --> 15:05.340]  It's all about watching the plants most of the time anyway.
[15:05.340 --> 15:06.860]  I was going to segue into that.
[15:06.860 --> 15:08.540]  That's a great way to do it.
[15:08.540 --> 15:09.900]  The calendar is a great thing.
[15:09.900 --> 15:14.760]  My recommendation on the seed package is a great thing, but there will be variables.
[15:14.760 --> 15:16.740]  Like always in life, there will be variables.
[15:16.740 --> 15:19.500]  You've got to pay attention to your trichomes.
[15:19.500 --> 15:24.300]  The trichomes on your plant are what indicate ripeness when those trichomes are turning
[15:24.300 --> 15:25.300]  amber.
[15:25.300 --> 15:27.300]  Some people like different ratios.
[15:27.300 --> 15:32.320]  I'm going to say somewhere between 20 and 30% amber trichomes on your plant.
[15:32.920 --> 15:35.760]  That is when it is a good time to harvest.
[15:35.760 --> 15:40.400]  The trichomes are the thing that contain the active ingredient, the active compounds, which
[15:40.400 --> 15:47.660]  give us a buzz, that make us stoned, that contain THC, CBD, CBN, CBG, all of the other
[15:47.660 --> 15:49.620]  wonderful cannabinoids we're seeking.
[15:49.620 --> 15:51.640]  Those are all in our trichome.
[15:51.640 --> 15:53.000]  Let's get the trichome ripe.
[15:53.000 --> 15:54.180]  That's what we're after.
[15:54.180 --> 15:55.400]  We are trichome farmers.
[15:55.400 --> 15:57.880]  A lot of people think they're growing big, beautiful plants.
[15:57.880 --> 15:59.120]  That's what you're growing.
[15:59.120 --> 16:02.340]  The main thing you are working on is beautiful trichomes.
[16:02.340 --> 16:04.280]  We want those trichomes.
[16:04.280 --> 16:10.200]  Since I'm on this path, this rant, pistils, or you guys call them hairs, the hairs do
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.600]  not have anything with indication of ripeness.
[16:14.600 --> 16:17.980]  Those hairs, those pistils are the breeding parts of the plant.
[16:17.980 --> 16:19.480]  Those things can change colors.
[16:19.480 --> 16:23.160]  A lot of people will say when the hairs turn brown or when the pistils turn brown, that's
[16:23.160 --> 16:24.700]  when the plants are finished.
[16:24.700 --> 16:25.700]  That is false.
[16:25.700 --> 16:26.700]  That is wrong.
[16:26.700 --> 16:27.700]  That is inaccurate.
[16:27.700 --> 16:29.140]  Those are for breeding.
[16:29.140 --> 16:34.660]  Those parts of the plant can be damaged, destroyed, withered, ruined from all kinds of things.
[16:34.660 --> 16:39.740]  A spray will make your pistils, can make your pistils of your plants turn brown and wither
[16:39.740 --> 16:40.740]  up.
[16:40.740 --> 16:41.860]  Wind can do it.
[16:41.860 --> 16:44.220]  Your skin oil touching it can do it.
[16:44.220 --> 16:47.960]  That plant just passing up its point of peak pollination can do it.
[16:47.960 --> 16:50.800]  Those plants only want pollen for so long into their life.
[16:50.800 --> 16:51.800]  They're just like people.
[16:51.800 --> 16:55.520]  They have a time when they can reproduce and then that time expires.
[16:55.520 --> 17:00.120]  When that time expires on a plant, the pistils turn brown and dry up and wither up and shrink
[17:00.120 --> 17:01.120]  in.
[17:01.120 --> 17:05.240]  Some people will say at that point, this plant is ready for harvest.
[17:05.240 --> 17:07.080]  Those people would be wrong.
[17:07.080 --> 17:14.040]  Those pistils, those hairs do not have any indicator, any indication, anything to do
[17:14.040 --> 17:16.000]  with the ripeness of your plant.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.320]  We are trichome farmers.
[17:17.320 --> 17:19.200]  We want ripe trichomes.
[17:19.200 --> 17:23.400]  Unless you're breeding for seeds, trichomes are all you should be measuring ripeness by.
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.360]  If you're breeding for seeds, then of course measure by the hardness and ripeness of the
[17:28.360 --> 17:30.280]  seeds inside of that plant.
[17:30.280 --> 17:34.320]  So that was a good rant for the same question I've been asked a lot of times.
[17:34.320 --> 17:36.800]  This one pops up at least once a month.
[17:36.800 --> 17:39.360]  I'm hoping, and this person has already heard it.
[17:39.360 --> 17:43.120]  This is going to be the third time that they've heard me say that.
[17:43.120 --> 17:47.960]  You set your timer to 1212 and that is day one of flowering.
[17:47.960 --> 17:50.600]  That's when you start counting flowering days.
[17:50.600 --> 17:55.160]  If I wrote 10 weeks on the seed package, that means you've got to let it finish week
[17:55.160 --> 17:56.160]  10.
[17:56.160 --> 17:58.400]  Don't let it go to week 10 and cut it down.
[17:58.400 --> 18:01.560]  Let it go through week 10 and cut it down.
[18:01.560 --> 18:04.760]  Possibly for funsies, let it go a little bit longer.
[18:04.760 --> 18:08.960]  All right, now since we're on this sort of a path, this topic here, here's something
[18:08.960 --> 18:11.680]  funny that I see on social media all the time.
[18:11.680 --> 18:13.080]  I understand why you're doing it.
[18:13.080 --> 18:17.360]  I understand what inspires this sort of a thought process, but I think that this is
[18:17.360 --> 18:18.360]  funny.
[18:18.360 --> 18:22.760]  A lot of times on social media, I will see something that says something like, I'm only
[18:22.760 --> 18:28.520]  two weeks away from week nine, which means you are in week seven.
[18:28.520 --> 18:30.760]  Just say I'm in week seven.
[18:30.760 --> 18:33.120]  I'm only two weeks away from week nine.
[18:33.120 --> 18:38.040]  I get it that you want to make it sound like you're further for your mind.
[18:38.040 --> 18:43.080]  You're tricking yourself to think I am only this far away, but just be realistic with
[18:43.080 --> 18:44.080]  yourself.
[18:44.080 --> 18:46.640]  Just say I am in the end of week six.
[18:46.640 --> 18:50.120]  A lot of people are saying I'm two weeks away from week nine, and they're technically
[18:50.120 --> 18:51.800]  in the end of week six.
[18:51.800 --> 18:53.940]  Be realistic with yourself.
[18:53.940 --> 18:56.000]  That way you have realistic expectations.
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.280]  You know your timeline.
[18:57.280 --> 18:58.280]  I get it.
[18:58.280 --> 19:02.000]  It's like little kids saying, it's only one month till Christmas.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.360]  I'm only 24 days away till Christmas.
[19:04.360 --> 19:05.360]  I get it.
[19:05.360 --> 19:08.360]  I get it, but let's not get too excited for Christmas.
[19:08.360 --> 19:09.480]  Let's be patient.
[19:09.480 --> 19:11.320]  Let's look at it realistically.
[19:11.320 --> 19:14.320]  That just makes me giggle on social media when I see that sort of stuff.
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.320]  Nothing personal.
[19:15.320 --> 19:16.320]  No hatred.
[19:17.000 --> 19:18.000]  That just makes me laugh.
[19:18.000 --> 19:19.280]  Let's see what the next message is.
[19:19.280 --> 19:22.040]  That message did come from our friend Saul.
[19:22.040 --> 19:23.320]  Big thanks to Saul.
[19:23.320 --> 19:29.400]  Dude, 12-12 is the day you flip that timer, or day one is the day you flip that timer
[19:29.400 --> 19:30.400]  to 12-12.
[19:30.400 --> 19:33.180]  I will get refocused here and work on the next message.
[19:33.180 --> 19:39.760]  This one comes from another friend who calls themselves Heaven and Hell, and their question
[19:39.760 --> 19:45.760]  says, hey, hey, hey, Master Rasta Jeff the Man with the magic breath.
[19:46.200 --> 19:50.000]  I didn't know that that was a thing, but that is a great way to start a message.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  What's up, bro?
[19:51.000 --> 19:52.000]  Good to meet you.
[19:52.000 --> 19:53.000]  That is one hell of an intro.
[19:53.000 --> 19:58.320]  It says, I was wondering what nutrient line you would recommend for your top three brands,
[19:58.320 --> 19:59.320]  please.
[19:59.320 --> 20:00.320]  That is a great question.
[20:00.320 --> 20:06.360]  That is an ever-evolving, ever-changing question for me because I do get to try a lot of different
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.360]  products.
[20:07.360 --> 20:08.360]  I get sent free things.
[20:08.360 --> 20:09.360]  I get sent samples.
[20:09.360 --> 20:10.360]  I get asked to try things.
[20:10.360 --> 20:14.040]  My friends give me a lot of input and a lot of feedback on products they're using.
[20:14.040 --> 20:17.340]  When I was working in a lot of commercial environments, I had a lot of space and places
[20:17.340 --> 20:19.520]  to experiment with new stuff.
[20:19.520 --> 20:22.040]  I keep going back to a few of the same things.
[20:22.040 --> 20:25.800]  Let's talk about the top three that I would recommend.
[20:25.800 --> 20:30.200]  For a very long time, I was having great success with the Botanicare line.
[20:30.200 --> 20:38.920]  I was using Botanicare, Pure Blend Pro, Liquid Karma, the CalMag, the Silica Blast, the Hydra
[20:38.920 --> 20:43.440]  Guard or Hydra Plex, maybe both.
[20:43.840 --> 20:45.640]  They had a couple other great products.
[20:45.640 --> 20:48.080]  There's a Bloom Booster that I can't think of the name of right now.
[20:48.080 --> 20:50.720]  They had a few other products that they were adding to their mix.
[20:50.720 --> 20:52.680]  Then I would add a couple other key things.
[20:52.680 --> 20:54.400]  Of course, I always add a couple of stuff.
[20:54.400 --> 20:56.960]  Whenever I get a brand, I like to add a couple of things.
[20:56.960 --> 20:59.560]  I was having great success with Botanicare.
[20:59.560 --> 21:05.720]  Unfortunately, there were some political reasons why I chose to sway away from Botanicare.
[21:05.720 --> 21:11.400]  It was mainly political reasons and I was seeing great success with another brand.
[21:11.400 --> 21:13.100]  Let's talk about the other brand.
[21:13.260 --> 21:17.260]  The other brand I switched to that I have great success with and I still use on a regular
[21:17.260 --> 21:20.420]  basis is New Millennium Bottled Nutrients.
[21:20.420 --> 21:22.340]  I think New Millennium is great.
[21:22.340 --> 21:27.020]  The way it's formulated, just the way it's measured out, it's easy to work with.
[21:27.020 --> 21:29.580]  It makes the plants grow with great vigor.
[21:29.580 --> 21:30.740]  They come out with good potency.
[21:30.740 --> 21:31.740]  They taste good.
[21:31.740 --> 21:32.820]  They finish on time.
[21:32.820 --> 21:34.380]  They've got products that help us finish.
[21:34.380 --> 21:36.660]  They've got products that help them root.
[21:36.660 --> 21:40.060]  The way the nutrients are broken down and the bottles are broken down makes a lot of
[21:40.060 --> 21:41.060]  sense.
[21:41.060 --> 21:44.020]  The way the product is calculated and scheduled is easy to follow.
[21:44.020 --> 21:45.820]  Jaren and Neil are good people.
[21:45.820 --> 21:47.780]  They've got good customer service.
[21:47.780 --> 21:50.900]  Honestly, nobody pays me to talk about this.
[21:50.900 --> 21:54.860]  I don't have big jugs of New Millennium Bottles sitting around or anything like that.
[21:54.860 --> 21:58.220]  I'll actually bump into Jaren at a couple of concerts this weekend and we'll say what's
[21:58.220 --> 22:01.540]  up and give each other a fist bump and won't talk about business at all.
[22:01.540 --> 22:03.580]  They do not pay me to advertise their brand.
[22:03.580 --> 22:04.580]  They don't give me free stuff.
[22:04.580 --> 22:08.380]  They did give me a free hat and I've gotten a few free bottles, but it's not ... There's
[22:08.380 --> 22:10.700]  nothing ... They don't pay me to advertise.
[22:10.860 --> 22:12.220]  I'm saying it's good shit.
[22:12.220 --> 22:16.980]  I have to buy it and I still go buy it at the growth store most of the time.
[22:16.980 --> 22:18.980]  New Millennium, good shit.
[22:18.980 --> 22:20.620]  It's easy to understand.
[22:20.620 --> 22:23.180]  Also, Botanicare is a good product.
[22:23.180 --> 22:26.700]  I switched using it because mainly for political reasons.
[22:26.700 --> 22:31.740]  If you aren't too worried about dollars and ethics and political stuff, Botanicare makes
[22:31.740 --> 22:32.740]  a great product.
[22:32.740 --> 22:34.220]  Just think about where your money's going.
[22:34.220 --> 22:36.300]  Maybe pay attention to that sort of stuff.
[22:36.300 --> 22:39.400]  On the Botanicare website, they have a great nutrient calculator.
[22:39.400 --> 22:44.000]  You can type in which bottles you've got, how many weeks of veg you expect to do, how
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.120]  many weeks of flour you expect, and it will tell you every week what to feed those plants.
[22:49.120 --> 22:50.880]  That makes it very easy.
[22:50.880 --> 22:52.920]  There are two brands that I really enjoyed using.
[22:52.920 --> 22:55.240]  That was Botanicare and New Millennium.
[22:55.240 --> 23:00.000]  I also had good experience with Vegbloom from Hydroponic Research.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.560]  They make a lot of good products.
[23:01.560 --> 23:04.760]  I think that is a great product for a commercial grow environment.
[23:04.760 --> 23:07.800]  I've talked a lot about Vegbloom and commercial grow environments.
[23:07.800 --> 23:09.040]  Really good stuff.
[23:09.080 --> 23:14.000]  I know you asked for three, but I also want to recommend BioBiz.
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.400]  BioBiz makes an affordable product, very easy to use, and the product that your finished
[23:19.400 --> 23:22.880]  flowers will taste so good with BioBiz.
[23:22.880 --> 23:23.880]  Good shit.
[23:23.880 --> 23:28.600]  Now, with all of that being said, let me make a couple of recommendations.
[23:28.600 --> 23:32.440]  You may be very limited with what is available to you in your area.
[23:32.440 --> 23:34.280]  I don't know if you're shopping online.
[23:34.280 --> 23:38.000]  I don't know if you're shopping at a local hydroponic store or a gardening center or
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.480]  whatever is available where you are.
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.920]  If you're going to the store to get what is available, I recommend you shop around and
[23:44.920 --> 23:48.480]  get what is there on the shelf so you don't have to pay extra for shipping.
[23:48.480 --> 23:50.120]  Shipping costs are expensive.
[23:50.120 --> 23:53.740]  Sending bottles of water across the country can get ridiculous.
[23:53.740 --> 23:58.520]  Maybe find something at the local grow store that will suit your needs.
[23:58.520 --> 24:00.480]  Maybe do some research on brands.
[24:00.480 --> 24:05.240]  I was talking earlier that one brand I really enjoyed, I switched because of political and
[24:05.240 --> 24:06.600]  other reasons.
[24:06.600 --> 24:08.520]  Maybe read about who is attached to who.
[24:08.520 --> 24:09.520]  Who are the parent companies?
[24:09.520 --> 24:12.000]  Who are the umbrella companies to that company?
[24:12.000 --> 24:15.120]  If that matters to you, pay attention to that sort of stuff.
[24:15.120 --> 24:18.360]  It may be easier for you to find products locally.
[24:18.360 --> 24:19.640]  They may be more reliable.
[24:19.640 --> 24:23.940]  It may be easier for you to build your arsenal up that way slowly over time locally than
[24:23.940 --> 24:25.900]  it would be to have stuff shipped.
[24:25.900 --> 24:28.960]  Maybe you can't have grow products shipped straight to your house.
[24:28.960 --> 24:33.960]  Sometimes, if you order bottles of grow nutrients, it will come just as that bottle of grow nutrients
[24:33.960 --> 24:38.400]  with plastic wrap wrapped around it and then some sort of security tape around the lid
[24:38.400 --> 24:40.360]  so it doesn't come popped open.
[24:40.360 --> 24:44.360]  The whole neighborhood knows you just got a bottle of whatever Pureblend Pro Organic
[24:44.360 --> 24:48.160]  Tea sitting on the front porch until you got home from work.
[24:48.160 --> 24:49.520]  It just sat out there all day.
[24:49.520 --> 24:50.980]  Who knows who drove by?
[24:50.980 --> 24:53.440]  Who knows who was walking the dogs and saw that?
[24:53.440 --> 24:57.420]  Who knows how many other neighborhood kids walked by and they grow weed too and they
[24:57.420 --> 24:58.600]  know what the fuck you got.
[24:58.600 --> 25:00.800]  Now they know that you grow weed.
[25:00.800 --> 25:01.920]  That's something to think about.
[25:01.920 --> 25:04.280]  Where are you going to source your products?
[25:04.280 --> 25:05.640]  Where are they going to come from?
[25:05.640 --> 25:08.120]  Can you get it at your local grow store?
[25:08.120 --> 25:10.040]  There was something else I wanted to add to that.
[25:10.040 --> 25:11.360]  The nutrient calculators.
[25:11.360 --> 25:15.920]  Go look at all of the nutrient calculators and nutrient schedules online.
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.720]  Check out the website for the brand that you intend to use.
[25:19.720 --> 25:23.460]  Try to stick with, if you're picking a brand, I say that I like adding stuff.
[25:23.460 --> 25:27.560]  Try to start with the brand and if you're going to use, let's just say that you're going
[25:27.560 --> 25:29.600]  to use New Millennium.
[25:29.600 --> 25:32.560]  New Millennium actually sells a great starter pack.
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.660]  Get that starter pack and use their website for their nutrient calculator and feed it
[25:36.660 --> 25:39.040]  like it says on the nutrient calculator.
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.400]  If you can't get all of the stuff on your wish list, start with the basics that you
[25:43.400 --> 25:44.400]  need now.
[25:44.400 --> 25:45.400]  You need a base.
[25:45.400 --> 25:46.800]  Are you in veg or in bloom?
[25:46.800 --> 25:48.320]  Get your bases for that.
[25:48.320 --> 25:49.320]  Then get your CalMag.
[25:49.320 --> 25:50.760]  Then get your rooting supplements.
[25:50.760 --> 25:53.800]  Then get your bloom boosters and just add them over time.
[25:53.800 --> 25:57.640]  Then after you harvest, maybe for your next run, get a couple of more bottles if you
[25:57.640 --> 25:58.820]  didn't run out.
[25:58.820 --> 26:02.220]  Think of it as every time you go to the store, you can get one or two more bottles like when
[26:02.220 --> 26:05.740]  you were a kid and you're just trying to expand your Lego sets or whatever you're doing.
[26:05.740 --> 26:07.700]  Get another game for the PlayStation.
[26:07.700 --> 26:08.700]  Think of it like that.
[26:08.700 --> 26:11.980]  Now just invest in new bottles every time you go.
[26:11.980 --> 26:13.780]  Then find a brand that you like.
[26:13.780 --> 26:16.180]  If you decide you don't like it, it's okay to switch.
[26:16.180 --> 26:18.500]  There's no problem with brand loyalty in this industry.
[26:18.500 --> 26:20.080]  You can switch brands.
[26:20.080 --> 26:22.020]  You can switch mid-grow if you really want to.
[26:22.020 --> 26:23.220]  The plants don't care.
[26:23.220 --> 26:26.220]  As long as they're getting fed and getting what they need, the plants may be happier
[26:26.220 --> 26:27.220]  if you switch.
[26:27.220 --> 26:29.980]  If you switch from a shitty product to a better product, they're eating better, they
[26:29.980 --> 26:31.460]  may be happier.
[26:31.460 --> 26:35.340]  But learn a product, see if you like it, run a crop or two with that.
[26:35.340 --> 26:36.900]  Run a crop or two with other stuff.
[26:36.900 --> 26:41.080]  Maybe if you can afford the space and the products and the time and the energy, maybe
[26:41.080 --> 26:42.620]  do two side by sides.
[26:42.620 --> 26:48.400]  Maybe do a new millennium run and whatever, a botanic care run and maybe a bio biz run
[26:48.400 --> 26:51.420]  and then some other brand that's local at your store that's available.
[26:51.420 --> 26:54.480]  Do those runs all together and see what works best for you.
[26:54.480 --> 26:56.140]  I know you asked for three.
[26:56.140 --> 27:05.060]  I'm going to say New Millennium Bottle Nutrients, Botanic Care, and Hydroponic Research's Veg
[27:05.060 --> 27:06.060]  Bloom products.
[27:06.060 --> 27:07.840]  That's probably my top three favorites.
[27:07.840 --> 27:10.080]  The Veg Bloom is my favorite for commercial growing.
[27:10.080 --> 27:14.760]  If I wasn't doing commercial growing, I'd probably swap that one out with Bio Biz for
[27:14.760 --> 27:16.260]  my third reply.
[27:16.260 --> 27:17.260]  All right.
[27:17.260 --> 27:19.860]  I think I've been rambling on for long enough.
[27:19.860 --> 27:22.900]  It feels like I need a drink, so I'm going to start wrapping up this show.
[27:22.900 --> 27:25.500]  I want to thank my buddy Heaven Hell for the great message.
[27:25.860 --> 27:28.660]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know I would love to hear
[27:28.660 --> 27:29.660]  from you.
[27:29.660 --> 27:32.540]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:32.540 --> 27:33.540]  Don't be shy.
[27:33.540 --> 27:34.660]  Send me your feedback.
[27:34.660 --> 27:35.780]  Send me your questions.
[27:35.780 --> 27:36.780]  Let me know what you think.
[27:36.780 --> 27:39.380]  You know I love creating listener-generated content.
[27:39.380 --> 27:41.420]  If you've got a question out there, send it to me.
[27:41.420 --> 27:42.420]  I'll answer it on the show.
[27:42.420 --> 27:44.060]  That means I'm at least helping you.
[27:44.060 --> 27:47.940]  I'm probably helping a few other people if you have got that question.
[27:47.940 --> 27:53.200]  Don't forget about the Patreon, patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[27:53.200 --> 27:55.180]  All the information is right there on the screen.
[27:55.860 --> 27:59.140]  Of course, there is a website at iregenetics.com.
[27:59.140 --> 28:04.140]  On that website there now is a link to the official IREGENETICS Grow From Your Heart
[28:04.140 --> 28:05.140]  Discord.
[28:05.140 --> 28:06.140]  Join the Discord.
[28:06.140 --> 28:07.140]  Hang out.
[28:07.140 --> 28:09.420]  Tap in, is what I think the cool kids say.
[28:09.420 --> 28:14.180]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[28:14.180 --> 28:18.140]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there,
[28:18.140 --> 28:23.500]  I want to thank you once again for listening to episode 669 of the Grow From Your Heart
[28:23.500 --> 28:24.500]  podcast.
[28:24.820 --> 28:27.980]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh, fresh new content.
[28:27.980 --> 28:30.620]  Let's send a big shout out to my buddy, Graybeard.
[28:30.620 --> 28:49.760]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
