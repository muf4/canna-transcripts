[00:00.000 --> 00:01.160]  Here we go.
[00:01.160 --> 00:04.520]  Welcome to episode 458 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:04.520 --> 00:07.440]  This episode of the show is brought to you by Seeds Here Now.
[00:07.440 --> 00:12.140]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:12.140 --> 00:19.520]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.520 --> 00:22.760]  You know, it has become a tradition that we start this podcast off by talking about what
[00:22.760 --> 00:23.760]  I'm dabbing.
[00:23.760 --> 00:28.280]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Infinity OG Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot
[00:28.280 --> 00:29.280]  Labs.
[00:29.280 --> 00:32.200]  It's a blend of Underdog OG and I-95.
[00:32.200 --> 00:37.320]  The package says, the aroma and flavor should be like gas, earth, and bitter skunk.
[00:37.320 --> 00:39.080]  I completely agree with that.
[00:39.080 --> 00:43.000]  It is gassy, it is earthy, and it is absolutely skunky.
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.400]  The potency label says that this product contains 67.26% THC and zero CBD.
[00:50.400 --> 00:55.560]  I really enjoy the aroma and flavor of the Infinity OG, and I think you can tell that
[00:55.560 --> 00:59.360]  it has a perfect buzz for podcasting.
[00:59.360 --> 01:03.940]  So big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the Infinity OG Live Batter.
[01:03.940 --> 01:06.080]  This stuff is delicious.
[01:06.080 --> 01:09.820]  In this episode of the podcast, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[01:09.820 --> 01:13.280]  Before we get there, I would like to do a couple of shout outs to some of our friends
[01:13.280 --> 01:15.160]  from Patreon.
[01:15.160 --> 01:18.240]  Let me start with a giant shout out to our new friend, St. Stephen.
[01:18.240 --> 01:22.840]  I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to our friend Baked PWN.
[01:22.840 --> 01:25.440]  Of course, a giant shout out to our friend Victor.
[01:25.520 --> 01:29.320]  Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and a fist bump to our friend Eric Ross.
[01:29.320 --> 01:33.960]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast
[01:33.960 --> 01:37.600]  shout out and a thank you to our friend Sam.
[01:37.600 --> 01:41.280]  If you would like to learn how to become a patron and support the show on Patreon, you
[01:41.280 --> 01:48.560]  can do so by visiting www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:48.560 --> 01:51.720]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:51.720 --> 01:56.160]  Once again, big shout out to all of my friends who have continued to help out on Patreon.
[01:56.160 --> 01:59.440]  All right, I said I've got some emails I would like to read.
[01:59.440 --> 02:02.360]  Let's jump right into that portion of the podcast.
[02:02.360 --> 02:05.700]  If you'd like to send me an email, if you've got a cannabis growing question, if you've
[02:05.700 --> 02:09.840]  got a cannabis culture question, maybe you've just got something you'd like to say, my email
[02:09.840 --> 02:13.600]  address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[02:13.600 --> 02:15.240]  I would love to hear from you.
[02:15.240 --> 02:19.060]  The first email I'm going to read in today's episode is an update.
[02:19.060 --> 02:22.300]  In a previous episode, I read an email about a failed timer.
[02:22.300 --> 02:26.100]  I recommended that our friend get rid of that timer and get his plants back on the correct
[02:26.100 --> 02:28.020]  schedule as soon as possible.
[02:28.020 --> 02:30.420]  He was kind enough to send us an update.
[02:30.420 --> 02:31.420]  So let's jump into it.
[02:31.420 --> 02:33.220]  It goes like this.
[02:33.220 --> 02:34.220]  What's up Rasta Jeff?
[02:34.220 --> 02:39.740]  I wanted to drop you an update on my issue with my tab timer, especially since you answered
[02:39.740 --> 02:41.340]  my question on your podcast.
[02:41.340 --> 02:42.780]  Well, thanks for keeping in touch.
[02:42.780 --> 02:44.260]  I do appreciate that.
[02:44.260 --> 02:49.100]  He goes on to say, dude, I was super stoked when I heard that shit, just because I felt
[02:49.100 --> 02:52.740]  that my problem may have helped another grower or a future grower.
[02:52.740 --> 02:54.440]  And that gave me a kick-ass feeling.
[02:54.440 --> 02:56.300]  So thank you for that.
[02:56.300 --> 02:58.260]  That's a really good way to look at it.
[02:58.260 --> 03:02.020]  Your mistake or your equipment failure actually led to you being able to help a few other
[03:02.020 --> 03:03.020]  people.
[03:03.020 --> 03:04.740]  So that's a pretty positive attitude.
[03:04.740 --> 03:09.300]  He goes on to say, I kicked that tab piece of shit timer out the back door when my new
[03:09.300 --> 03:10.700]  timer came.
[03:10.700 --> 03:12.420]  The plants look good so far, man.
[03:12.420 --> 03:15.100]  And I've been checking over them pretty thoroughly.
[03:15.100 --> 03:16.900]  And I warned him that he had a light interruption.
[03:16.900 --> 03:21.100]  So I warned him to keep an eye out for hermaphrodites or problems with the plants, because that
[03:21.100 --> 03:23.660]  may arise because of the light interruption.
[03:23.660 --> 03:25.180]  He says so far, no problems.
[03:25.180 --> 03:26.820]  He's been looking pretty thoroughly.
[03:26.820 --> 03:28.820]  He says I may have lucked out this time.
[03:28.820 --> 03:33.340]  The genetics are fems from blim-burned seeds, and they seem pretty reputable.
[03:33.340 --> 03:38.820]  They are growing in soil with Blue Planet, Farmer's Pride line, and Recharge NA10.
[03:38.820 --> 03:40.220]  So it sounds like you've got good genetics.
[03:40.740 --> 03:42.020]  I don't know who that breeding company is.
[03:42.020 --> 03:43.020]  No offense to them.
[03:43.020 --> 03:44.540]  I just haven't researched them yet.
[03:44.540 --> 03:46.340]  It sounds like you've got some quality genetics.
[03:46.340 --> 03:48.060]  They did not hermaphrodite on you.
[03:48.060 --> 03:49.060]  You've got good nutrients.
[03:49.060 --> 03:52.820]  And I'm going to say that that Recharge in there is what rescued everything.
[03:52.820 --> 03:55.660]  So it goes on to say, thanks again for all of your knowledge.
[03:55.660 --> 03:58.540]  Then the best part of the email, it says, P.S.
[03:58.540 --> 04:03.180]  The wife made me go get that timer from outside, and it is now in the trash.
[04:03.180 --> 04:06.940]  That is really funny because as I read that portion of the message where it says you kicked
[04:07.020 --> 04:13.460]  the timer out the back door, I mentally visualized you dropkicking it, throwing it up in the
[04:13.460 --> 04:16.940]  air a couple of inches, booting it across the backyard into oblivion.
[04:16.940 --> 04:17.940]  Who knows where it went?
[04:17.940 --> 04:18.940]  It's out there somewhere.
[04:18.940 --> 04:19.980]  Don't give a shit anymore.
[04:19.980 --> 04:20.980]  It sucks.
[04:20.980 --> 04:21.980]  Want to forget about it.
[04:21.980 --> 04:22.980]  That's really funny.
[04:22.980 --> 04:23.980]  I saw that happen, but then I thought about it.
[04:23.980 --> 04:25.820]  I was like, well, now there's a timer in the backyard.
[04:25.820 --> 04:27.180]  Glad your wife made you go get it.
[04:27.180 --> 04:30.580]  I'm even more excited that the plants are not showing you any problems.
[04:30.580 --> 04:34.300]  I'm glad that you did not disrupt the light cycle enough to where those plants hermed
[04:34.300 --> 04:35.300]  out on you.
[04:35.300 --> 04:38.260]  I'm glad the plants are going to make it through harvest.
[04:38.260 --> 04:41.820]  Don't think that you can stop looking for herms.
[04:41.820 --> 04:43.220]  They may take a while to show up.
[04:43.220 --> 04:44.980]  They may not show up till week eight.
[04:44.980 --> 04:47.260]  They may not show up until week nine.
[04:47.260 --> 04:50.580]  If they show up in week eight or week nine, you do have a few options.
[04:50.580 --> 04:52.300]  You've got a few things to think about.
[04:52.300 --> 04:54.220]  You can simply let them finish.
[04:54.220 --> 04:58.100]  If they do have pollen, which is very unlikely, they'll probably be sterile.
[04:58.100 --> 05:00.300]  It probably won't contain active pollen.
[05:00.300 --> 05:04.620]  If they do, that pollen won't have time to pollinate and make any seeds.
[05:04.620 --> 05:08.980]  Not a big deal if it does perm way late in the flower cycle, but keep an eye on that
[05:08.980 --> 05:12.980]  because that is a good note to take and good info to have on your plants.
[05:12.980 --> 05:13.980]  All right.
[05:13.980 --> 05:15.620]  I appreciate the great update.
[05:15.620 --> 05:16.800]  Continue to look at those plants.
[05:16.800 --> 05:20.220]  Make sure you don't get any problems in the future and keep me updated.
[05:20.220 --> 05:22.340]  If you have any questions, please reach out.
[05:22.340 --> 05:23.980]  I'll be happy to help you out.
[05:23.980 --> 05:24.980]  All right.
[05:24.980 --> 05:26.380]  Let's move on to the next email.
[05:26.380 --> 05:29.200]  This one is very interesting.
[05:29.200 --> 05:30.620]  This email goes just like this.
[05:30.620 --> 05:36.020]  Hey Rasta Jeff, I dig your podcast and I wanted to reach out and ask you a couple of questions.
[05:36.020 --> 05:40.220]  You're more than welcome to use my first name if you think they're good for the podcast.
[05:40.220 --> 05:41.220]  What's up Alex?
[05:41.220 --> 05:42.220]  Thank you for the great email.
[05:42.220 --> 05:44.100]  His question goes like this.
[05:44.100 --> 05:49.060]  First question, I just harvested about a dozen plants and they were absolutely bursting with
[05:49.060 --> 05:50.060]  seeds.
[05:50.060 --> 05:53.840]  It really sucked because my yield was super low and I'm sure my flower still has some
[05:53.840 --> 05:55.860]  seeds buried in it.
[05:55.860 --> 06:00.240]  Earlier in the grow, I discovered two of the plants in my tent were male, so I got rid
[06:00.360 --> 06:04.800]  of them, but I'm guessing I did not discover this in time and they turned the rest of the
[06:04.800 --> 06:05.800]  females hermaphroditic.
[06:05.800 --> 06:09.080]  No, that's not what happened.
[06:09.080 --> 06:14.680]  What happened was those males pollinated and they seeded the plants just like they're supposed
[06:14.680 --> 06:15.680]  to.
[06:15.680 --> 06:17.100]  Those females were not hermaphroditic.
[06:17.100 --> 06:20.000]  Those females never expressed male signs.
[06:20.000 --> 06:25.080]  That's what a hermaphrodite plant is, a female that shows you male sex traits when it is
[06:25.080 --> 06:28.260]  stressed or maybe at any point in the flowering cycle.
[06:28.260 --> 06:29.680]  That is a hermaphrodite.
[06:30.120 --> 06:34.060]  What you have got here is a natural male pollinating natural females.
[06:34.060 --> 06:36.020]  That is natural impregnation.
[06:36.020 --> 06:38.320]  That is exactly what is supposed to happen in nature.
[06:38.320 --> 06:40.080]  There was no hermaphroditism.
[06:40.080 --> 06:41.600]  There was no problem.
[06:41.600 --> 06:45.640]  Everything went according to plan other than you pulling those male plants out of that
[06:45.640 --> 06:48.920]  room before they were able to drop pollen.
[06:48.920 --> 06:52.440]  The important lesson there is next time, you've got to be more diligent.
[06:52.440 --> 06:55.800]  You've got to pay more attention for the males and you have got to get them out of the room
[06:55.800 --> 06:56.800]  sooner.
[06:56.800 --> 07:00.800]  Also another thing to learn, your plants did not hermaphrodite and make seeds.
[07:00.800 --> 07:01.800]  They were pollinated.
[07:01.800 --> 07:02.800]  They were impregnated.
[07:02.800 --> 07:04.280]  There was a huge difference there.
[07:04.280 --> 07:07.740]  I just want to make sure we're using the right terms so that we understand where we're going
[07:07.740 --> 07:09.000]  in the future.
[07:09.000 --> 07:10.000]  Let's talk more.
[07:10.000 --> 07:11.360]  It says, more questions.
[07:11.360 --> 07:16.320]  Is it ever safe to grow in an enclosed tent with seeds that are not feminized?
[07:16.320 --> 07:18.560]  That is absolutely safe.
[07:18.560 --> 07:22.800]  Feminized seeds are just as safe as regular seeds.
[07:22.800 --> 07:27.360]  If you are growing in any type of environment, there is no difference if they are bred properly,
[07:27.360 --> 07:28.920]  if they are done correctly.
[07:28.920 --> 07:34.600]  There is no difference in the potency, the vigor, the viability.
[07:34.600 --> 07:39.560]  Nothing will be noticeably different in a feminized seed from a regular seed other than
[07:39.560 --> 07:42.660]  the fact that it is only a female.
[07:42.660 --> 07:47.200]  Our friend Mr. Soul recently posted something to social media and he put it in a very simple
[07:47.200 --> 07:50.560]  term that I think is a great way to teach other people.
[07:50.560 --> 07:52.360]  I like to give people credit.
[07:52.920 --> 07:53.920]  Mr. Soul is where I learned this.
[07:53.920 --> 07:55.160]  This was not my idea.
[07:55.160 --> 07:56.680]  Big shout out to Rick.
[07:56.680 --> 07:58.760]  Big respect to Brothers Grim Seeds.
[07:58.760 --> 08:04.400]  The way that Mr. Soul put it was, when we are making feminized pollen, we are basically
[08:04.400 --> 08:08.400]  removing all of the male pollen from the equation.
[08:08.400 --> 08:13.080]  Imagine if I took a regular male plant and I was able to shake that plant and I could
[08:13.080 --> 08:18.320]  identify in the air which pollen was male and which pollen was female.
[08:18.400 --> 08:22.880]  Imagine if I took a filter that was able to suck out all of that male pollen.
[08:22.880 --> 08:26.040]  All of the pollen landing on my plants are female.
[08:26.040 --> 08:29.600]  I'm only putting female pollen on female plants.
[08:29.600 --> 08:34.840]  There are only female chromosomes, so I only have the potential for female offspring.
[08:34.840 --> 08:37.520]  That is how a feminized seed works.
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.920]  Feminized seeds and regular seeds are equal if they are made correctly.
[08:43.920 --> 08:49.600]  Feminized seeds must be made from solid female starting parent stock.
[08:49.600 --> 08:56.640]  If the starting parents have intersex or hermaphroditic traits, that trait may be passed on in that
[08:56.640 --> 08:57.640]  breeding.
[08:57.640 --> 09:02.640]  But if I am working with a solid female plant that receives pollen that has been reversed
[09:02.640 --> 09:07.080]  properly, I will only create female plants.
[09:07.080 --> 09:10.040]  All of those offspring will be female.
[09:10.040 --> 09:16.360]  It is absolutely safe to grow in an enclosed tent with seeds that are or are not feminized.
[09:16.360 --> 09:18.440]  They are basically the same thing.
[09:18.440 --> 09:22.600]  The main difference is you've got to pull those males out before they drop pollen.
[09:22.600 --> 09:24.540]  It is really easy to see a male plant.
[09:24.540 --> 09:25.600]  You know what it looks like now.
[09:25.600 --> 09:26.600]  You have seen it.
[09:26.600 --> 09:28.360]  You've just got to pay more attention.
[09:28.360 --> 09:29.920]  You've got to pull it sooner.
[09:29.920 --> 09:33.400]  If you didn't get it out of there before it pollinated, you were not paying close enough
[09:33.400 --> 09:34.400]  attention.
[09:34.400 --> 09:36.040]  You've got to look every single day.
[09:36.040 --> 09:37.040]  You should have been in there.
[09:37.040 --> 09:38.040]  You should have seen that.
[09:38.040 --> 09:39.800]  That is a grower's responsibility.
[09:40.560 --> 09:47.360]  Yes, it is absolutely safe to grow feminized or regular seeds in an enclosed tent.
[09:47.360 --> 09:51.320]  Before I wrap up that section, I want to give a big shout out and a big thank you once again
[09:51.320 --> 09:53.760]  to my friend Mr. Soul from Brothers Grim Seeds.
[09:53.760 --> 09:58.480]  I did borrow the quote about being able to filter out the male pollen.
[09:58.480 --> 09:59.780]  That was his concept.
[09:59.780 --> 10:04.000]  That is basically what we are doing when we're making feminized seeds.
[10:04.000 --> 10:05.000]  Let's continue.
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.880]  There are more sections to this question.
[10:06.880 --> 10:10.480]  Is there an easy way to tell if plants are male earlier on?
[10:10.480 --> 10:15.520]  I was checking for the little balls but really couldn't spot anything amiss.
[10:15.520 --> 10:21.580]  The male plants actually start showing flower much sooner than the females in my experience.
[10:21.580 --> 10:25.960]  Most of the time it takes the girls about 10 to 14 days for you can really look at them
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.580]  and go, that's a solid female.
[10:27.580 --> 10:29.560]  The boys want to show right away.
[10:29.560 --> 10:30.880]  They're like, hey, I got to pollinate.
[10:30.880 --> 10:32.720]  I got to get taller than everybody.
[10:32.720 --> 10:34.000]  I got to get my balls dropping.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.240]  I got to get my pollen everywhere.
[10:35.240 --> 10:36.240]  I'm eager.
[10:36.600 --> 10:40.120]  They're like a teenage boy just trying to get out there, just trying to get some attention,
[10:40.120 --> 10:42.800]  just trying to bust a nut, trying to spread some seed.
[10:42.800 --> 10:45.480]  The boys will show you a little earlier on.
[10:45.480 --> 10:47.320]  You should be able to identify it.
[10:47.320 --> 10:52.080]  I do not have a good way to show you what a male plant looks like through a podcast.
[10:52.080 --> 10:58.160]  It is your responsibility to get a book or use Google and type in male cannabis plant
[10:58.160 --> 11:02.680]  or female cannabis plant and then click on the images tab and look and see the difference
[11:02.680 --> 11:05.040]  in a male and a female cannabis plant.
[11:05.040 --> 11:11.520]  It should be very easy to tell the difference early in flower if you were paying attention.
[11:11.520 --> 11:16.040]  You will see basically little hair-like looking things coming out.
[11:16.040 --> 11:18.160]  Those are probably female plants.
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.200]  You will see little nubbins, little acorn looking things coming out.
[11:22.200 --> 11:23.500]  Those are balls.
[11:23.500 --> 11:24.500]  Those are male plants.
[11:24.500 --> 11:26.520]  It is really obvious to tell.
[11:26.520 --> 11:29.320]  If you weren't able to find that, I don't think you were looking well enough.
[11:29.320 --> 11:35.200]  I don't think you did the prerequisite research on growing before you set up your grow.
[11:35.200 --> 11:37.880]  I don't think you were in there looking frequently enough.
[11:37.880 --> 11:41.560]  If you had done some research and read a book before you set up the grow, which is always
[11:41.560 --> 11:46.600]  my advice, read some books before you start growing so you know what you're getting into.
[11:46.600 --> 11:49.540]  Then also pay attention to the plants every single day.
[11:49.540 --> 11:54.640]  You have to touch every plant in your garden every single day if you want to be a successful
[11:54.640 --> 11:55.640]  gardener.
[11:55.640 --> 11:58.120]  Those are a couple of things that I would recommend you brush up on.
[11:58.120 --> 12:00.340]  Get some books, get some Google going on.
[12:00.340 --> 12:01.640]  Look at some images.
[12:01.640 --> 12:06.640]  Learn how to visually identify a male plant before you get three days into your next flowering
[12:06.640 --> 12:09.600]  cycle so we can prevent this in the next run.
[12:09.600 --> 12:12.400]  We can absolutely tell if the plants are male.
[12:12.400 --> 12:17.640]  Probably five to seven days, absolutely 10 days into flower, you should be able to tell.
[12:17.640 --> 12:20.000]  You've just got to get familiar with what that looks like.
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.240]  That is the next step.
[12:21.240 --> 12:24.880]  Part three of this question is, if you have super seedy flower and you pluck most of it
[12:24.880 --> 12:29.480]  out but a seed or two goes through the grinder, is this a really bad thing?
[12:29.480 --> 12:32.840]  No, back in the day, bro, we used to not get seedless weed.
[12:32.840 --> 12:34.840]  We used to get weed filled with seeds.
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.400]  We used to buy Mexican brick weed that you'd grind it up and half of it was seeds.
[12:39.400 --> 12:42.360]  Unless my buddy Randy was around, we weren't getting all those seeds out.
[12:42.360 --> 12:43.360]  Randy would make it a mission.
[12:43.360 --> 12:45.880]  You could give Randy your bag of weed and say, here, go for it.
[12:45.880 --> 12:48.560]  Randy would get all the seeds out like that was his damn job.
[12:48.560 --> 12:51.680]  But unless he was there, there was a good chance you were going to smoke a schwag weed
[12:51.680 --> 12:53.320]  seed, a brick weed seed.
[12:53.320 --> 12:54.360]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[12:54.840 --> 12:55.840]  It might make your joint pop.
[12:55.840 --> 12:57.160]  It might make your bowl pop a little bit.
[12:57.160 --> 12:58.960]  It might make it taste like shit.
[12:58.960 --> 12:59.960]  It's not going to be terrible.
[12:59.960 --> 13:01.440]  It won't be the end of the world.
[13:01.440 --> 13:02.880]  And you said you're going to put it in a grinder.
[13:02.880 --> 13:05.800]  So you're probably going to put some nuggets in the grinder, give it a couple of spins.
[13:05.800 --> 13:06.800]  You'll hear them.
[13:06.800 --> 13:08.200]  You'll hear those seeds go ting, ting, ting, ting, ting.
[13:08.200 --> 13:09.280]  They'll fall through.
[13:09.280 --> 13:10.280]  Just be careful.
[13:10.280 --> 13:13.080]  Open it up, dump that weed out, get the seeds out of there.
[13:13.080 --> 13:16.560]  Depending on the quality of those male plants and depending on the quality of those females,
[13:16.560 --> 13:19.640]  shit, you may have some good quality seeds worth growing.
[13:19.640 --> 13:20.720]  Do not sell them.
[13:20.720 --> 13:22.840]  Do not pass them on to your friends.
[13:22.840 --> 13:26.840]  Don't do anything with them now except for grow them yourself.
[13:26.840 --> 13:27.960]  Grow out a few of them.
[13:27.960 --> 13:29.040]  See what you've got.
[13:29.040 --> 13:32.440]  You may have some completely amazing new crosses.
[13:32.440 --> 13:33.920]  You may have some total bullshit.
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.240]  That's why I say you can't sell it or give it away.
[13:36.240 --> 13:37.920]  You've got to grow it yourself.
[13:37.920 --> 13:39.400]  Find out if it's worth a shit.
[13:39.400 --> 13:44.440]  Waste your own time, energy, space, and resources before you waste anybody else's.
[13:44.440 --> 13:48.040]  Those are free seeds, but they could just be a problem if you give them to anybody.
[13:48.040 --> 13:49.280]  So I would grow them.
[13:49.280 --> 13:50.960]  That's what I would do with those seeds.
[13:50.960 --> 13:52.580]  Smoke the product you can smoke.
[13:52.580 --> 13:54.140]  Grow the seeds you can grow.
[13:54.140 --> 13:55.140]  Have fun with it.
[13:55.140 --> 13:58.780]  It sounds like you had a problem in your personal grow, but this is an opportunity to learn
[13:58.780 --> 13:59.780]  something.
[13:59.780 --> 14:02.700]  You need to learn to identify the males a little bit earlier.
[14:02.700 --> 14:06.820]  We have learned that those females did not become hermaphroditic, that they actually
[14:06.820 --> 14:08.600]  became impregnated.
[14:08.600 --> 14:10.260]  We learned a little bit about breeding.
[14:10.260 --> 14:13.300]  So this was a good learning opportunity for you.
[14:13.300 --> 14:14.420]  There is more to the question.
[14:14.420 --> 14:19.660]  It says, and a couple other questions about seedlings and clones in early stages.
[14:19.660 --> 14:24.460]  It says, I've read a lot online how you have to cover clones in a plastic bag or a humidity
[14:24.460 --> 14:27.860]  dome for a while, and the same with new seedlings.
[14:27.860 --> 14:32.220]  Can you do that in a tent without overheating them and frying them under the dome?
[14:32.220 --> 14:37.020]  Or would it be better to just run a small humidifier constantly in the tent to make
[14:37.020 --> 14:39.420]  sure there's enough moisture?
[14:39.420 --> 14:40.420]  Thanks and rock on.
[14:40.420 --> 14:41.420]  And then they signed it from Alex.
[14:41.420 --> 14:43.220]  Hey Alex, thanks for the great email.
[14:43.220 --> 14:47.300]  There are a couple of things to touch on in that last question.
[14:47.300 --> 14:51.900]  So you've read a lot about covering clones in a plastic bag or a humidity dome.
[14:51.900 --> 14:56.740]  Yes, we do need to keep clones under some sort of a humidity dome.
[14:56.740 --> 14:58.180]  The clones don't have roots.
[14:58.180 --> 14:59.220]  They don't have a way to feed.
[14:59.220 --> 15:00.500]  They don't have a way to eat.
[15:00.500 --> 15:04.900]  We've got to keep a nice moist environment so that they can get all of their life from
[15:04.900 --> 15:06.480]  their leaves, from the air.
[15:06.480 --> 15:09.960]  So that is why we want to keep the clones nice and humid.
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.620]  Most of the time we prefer a humidity dome because it is much easier to control the environment
[15:14.700 --> 15:19.820]  in a little one foot shoebox size section than it is in a five by five by eight grow
[15:19.820 --> 15:20.820]  tent.
[15:20.820 --> 15:21.820]  That is a lot different.
[15:21.820 --> 15:22.820]  It's a lot of space.
[15:22.820 --> 15:24.820]  You're going to require a lot more equipment.
[15:24.820 --> 15:29.420]  If you want to control that environment in that giant tent, go for it.
[15:29.420 --> 15:34.140]  It is going to be a constant struggle to keep a grow tent inside of a room at the correct
[15:34.140 --> 15:37.100]  VPD at all times to keep clones alive.
[15:37.100 --> 15:42.340]  It will be much easier to do so in a small clone dome.
[15:42.340 --> 15:47.600]  In a large scale commercial horticultural environment, yes, we would have a room where
[15:47.600 --> 15:49.940]  the environment is just right for the clones.
[15:49.940 --> 15:54.760]  You wouldn't even need domes, but that is a huge room with all of the appropriate equipment
[15:54.760 --> 15:56.500]  and it is dedicated to that.
[15:56.500 --> 15:59.860]  And that tent is not in a bedroom inside your house.
[15:59.860 --> 16:05.040]  That is in a dedicated space that is designed, built, and committed for cloning.
[16:05.040 --> 16:06.460]  So it's a huge difference.
[16:06.460 --> 16:10.340]  If you would like to do the entire tent, you can absolutely do that, but it is going
[16:10.340 --> 16:12.260]  to be a challenge the entire way.
[16:12.260 --> 16:14.620]  Why not set yourself up for success?
[16:14.620 --> 16:16.460]  Use a much smaller environment.
[16:16.460 --> 16:18.720]  That's why it is so common because it works.
[16:18.720 --> 16:20.620]  We have been doing this for a long time.
[16:20.620 --> 16:25.540]  We have figured out a lot of ways to fail and we have figured out a few ways to be successful.
[16:25.540 --> 16:28.420]  So that's why you keep seeing the domes pop up.
[16:28.420 --> 16:32.700]  Now the question is more specific and it says, can you put the dome in a tent without frying
[16:32.700 --> 16:34.060]  them under the dome?
[16:34.060 --> 16:36.220]  Yes, you absolutely can.
[16:36.260 --> 16:37.860]  The tent shouldn't be that hot.
[16:37.860 --> 16:42.940]  The tent shouldn't be any higher than 70 or 80 degrees, maybe 84 degrees at the max.
[16:42.940 --> 16:46.020]  If you've got that dome in the tent, it's probably on the floor.
[16:46.020 --> 16:49.180]  Maybe you've got it on a little shelf, not all the way up at the top, but closer down
[16:49.180 --> 16:50.180]  to the floor.
[16:50.180 --> 16:52.440]  It's okay to get those clones fairly warm.
[16:52.440 --> 16:54.700]  We want warmth and humidity for those clones.
[16:54.700 --> 16:56.080]  You're not going to cook them.
[16:56.080 --> 16:57.080]  Don't put them on a heat mat.
[16:57.080 --> 16:58.540]  I don't think they need a mat.
[16:58.540 --> 16:59.620]  I think they will be okay.
[16:59.620 --> 17:03.980]  As long as you're not raging the temperatures in that grow tent, you should be okay.
[17:03.980 --> 17:06.860]  It sounds like you plan on growing a crop in there, so you've got to be able to control
[17:06.860 --> 17:08.460]  the temperature in that tent.
[17:08.460 --> 17:12.600]  So yeah, unless you're getting that room, that tent up to some crazy, ridiculous temperatures,
[17:12.600 --> 17:17.340]  you will be wonderful having your clones inside of a dome inside of that tent.
[17:17.340 --> 17:19.100]  I actually did that for a very long time.
[17:19.100 --> 17:22.220]  I had one small veg space and it was inside of a tent.
[17:22.220 --> 17:26.580]  I just put my clones, flip a five gallon bucket upside down, use that as a table, put the
[17:26.580 --> 17:29.700]  clone dome right on that fucking five gallon bucket.
[17:29.700 --> 17:32.860]  So it'd be just elevated just high enough to get enough lights where they would root.
[17:32.860 --> 17:34.340]  I think it works beautifully.
[17:34.340 --> 17:38.740]  So yes, you can put the dome inside of the tent.
[17:38.740 --> 17:44.020]  Now one thing I do want to touch on that you mentioned is I do not like to cover my seedlings
[17:44.020 --> 17:47.380]  in any type of humidity dome or a bag.
[17:47.380 --> 17:49.900]  I like to leave them open and exposed.
[17:49.900 --> 17:51.700]  I like my seedlings to get wind.
[17:51.700 --> 17:53.500]  I like them to get a little bit stressed out.
[17:53.500 --> 17:55.780]  They don't need the moisture like the clones need.
[17:55.780 --> 17:58.460]  The seedlings are developing a taproot.
[17:58.460 --> 18:02.780]  They're exploding with growth at the bottom equally as they're growing from the top.
[18:02.820 --> 18:04.780]  Hopefully maybe a little bit more at the bottom.
[18:04.780 --> 18:08.260]  I like to see more root growth than I like to see plant development early on with my
[18:08.260 --> 18:09.260]  seedlings.
[18:09.260 --> 18:13.100]  So we don't really need a humidity dome in that type of situation.
[18:13.100 --> 18:15.660]  I like to kind of stress the seedlings out to tell you the truth.
[18:15.660 --> 18:19.260]  Put a little bit of wind on them, make them blow over a little bit, put them in that warm
[18:19.260 --> 18:21.500]  environment so they start taking off.
[18:21.500 --> 18:23.340]  Don't make them pussies from the beginning.
[18:23.340 --> 18:27.620]  I want my seedlings to sprout up and go, ah shit, I got to get to work immediately.
[18:27.620 --> 18:31.220]  I don't want them to grow up and go, ah, I can be a pussy for a little while.
[18:31.220 --> 18:32.300]  Why give them the option?
[18:32.300 --> 18:34.940]  I just want them to be fucking soldiers from day one.
[18:34.940 --> 18:38.820]  So I don't recommend a humidity dome for my seedlings ever.
[18:38.820 --> 18:40.320]  That's not something I do.
[18:40.320 --> 18:46.220]  You can absolutely put your clone dome inside of your tent that will work perfectly for
[18:46.220 --> 18:50.180]  you as long as that tent doesn't get over 80 degrees probably.
[18:50.180 --> 18:55.500]  And you can absolutely, if you would prefer, just fill the tent to the perfect moisture
[18:55.500 --> 18:58.020]  and temperature, but that would be a constant struggle.
[18:58.020 --> 18:59.580]  So big shout out to our friend Alex.

[21:41.760 --> 21:44.480]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Lemur Priest.
