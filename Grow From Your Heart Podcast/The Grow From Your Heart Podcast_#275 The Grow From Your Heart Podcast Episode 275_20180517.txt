[01:29.840 --> 01:33.840]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,

[01:36.840 --> 01:38.840]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[01:38.840 --> 01:40.840]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[01:40.840 --> 01:44.840]  As always, I'm going to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots Band
[01:44.840 --> 01:46.840]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.840]  Big shout out to Kat, Kud and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:50.840 --> 01:56.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday evening in Pueblo, Colorado and it is hot as shit for some reason.
[01:56.840 --> 01:57.840]  Why is it so warm, dude?
[01:57.840 --> 01:58.840]  Global warming.
[01:58.840 --> 02:00.840]  Global warming. He blamed us.
[02:00.840 --> 02:01.840]  That's perfect. I agree with you.
[02:01.840 --> 02:03.840]  It's almost 710.
[02:03.840 --> 02:04.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the podcast.
[02:04.840 --> 02:06.840]  Across the table from me is a repeat offender.
[02:06.840 --> 02:07.840]  I don't know if you caught that in the intro.
[02:07.840 --> 02:08.840]  I did say barefoot grower.
[02:08.840 --> 02:11.840]  My buddy, Will, the barefoot grower is back on the podcast.
[02:11.840 --> 02:12.840]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[02:12.840 --> 02:13.840]  Hey, thanks for having me, man.
[02:13.840 --> 02:14.840]  Good to be back.
[02:14.840 --> 02:15.840]  Dude, thanks for coming.
[02:15.840 --> 02:17.840]  My lips are all sticky because we just took some super delicious dabs
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.840]  and the dab rig that I've got from Elevate has that mouthpiece that makes your mouth kind of do the kissy face
[02:22.840 --> 02:24.840]  and it made my lips all sticky so my words are going.
[02:25.840 --> 02:28.840]  It's pretty funny over here for seeing me trying to struggle and talk.
[02:28.840 --> 02:30.840]  I got the sticky dab wax in my mustache.
[02:31.840 --> 02:32.840]  Dab residue.
[02:32.840 --> 02:34.840]  Back in the day, I'm ranting now,
[02:34.840 --> 02:39.840]  but back in the day, I used to go to the clinic in Denver and they sold this Durban Poison wax
[02:39.840 --> 02:41.840]  and it had the best high.
[02:41.840 --> 02:44.840]  I loved it, but after you would smoke it, if you put your teeth together,
[02:44.840 --> 02:45.840]  they would stick together a little bit.
[02:45.840 --> 02:46.840]  Oh, no, that's funny.
[02:46.840 --> 02:47.840]  For some reason, I loved it.
[02:47.840 --> 02:50.840]  I would just sit there and just stick my teeth together and pull them apart.
[02:50.840 --> 02:52.840]  I'd just do it over and over and over.
[02:52.840 --> 02:53.840]  I kind of know what you're talking about.
[02:53.840 --> 02:54.840]  I know what that feeling is.
[02:54.840 --> 02:57.840]  Yeah, it was almost like you took a bite of a crayon, kind of,
[02:57.840 --> 03:00.840]  but for some reason, I loved the texture.
[03:00.840 --> 03:01.840]  I'm weird.
[03:01.840 --> 03:02.840]  Sorry.
[03:02.840 --> 03:03.840]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[03:03.840 --> 03:04.840]  I'm ranting.
[03:04.840 --> 03:05.840]  Let's see.
[03:05.840 --> 03:06.840]  Do I got to give anybody a shout out?
[03:06.840 --> 03:07.840]  Let's see.
[03:07.840 --> 03:12.840]  Shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass because I've been hitting this orange pumpkin rig like a boss.
[03:12.840 --> 03:13.840]  That banger is filthy.
[03:13.840 --> 03:15.840]  The rig needs a bath.
[03:15.840 --> 03:17.840]  Thanks again, you guys, for the dope rig.
[03:18.840 --> 03:20.840]  So, well, welcome to the show.
[03:20.840 --> 03:21.840]  We've got a bunch of notes.
[03:21.840 --> 03:23.840]  Are you still blowing glass, dude, or has that kind of been?
[03:23.840 --> 03:25.840]  No, that's just kind of put on.
[03:26.840 --> 03:28.840]  I'm hoping to maybe one day get back into it.
[03:28.840 --> 03:29.840]  Do you miss it?
[03:29.840 --> 03:30.840]  I do miss it every now and then.
[03:30.840 --> 03:32.840]  I can see that you got a huge smile when we started talking about it.
[03:32.840 --> 03:40.840]  Yeah, whenever I go because I have some friends that still do it, and if I go to their house or whatever and I get into the studio, it's kind of like, I don't know, I miss it.
[03:40.840 --> 03:41.840]  Yeah, your fingers start spinning?
[03:41.840 --> 03:47.840]  Yeah, I'm always just like, man, I want to kind of ask them if I can hop behind the torch, but they're not blowing glass, so I don't want to intrude.
[03:47.840 --> 03:48.840]  That gas is so expensive.
[03:48.840 --> 03:49.840]  Exactly, and I know that too.
[03:49.840 --> 03:51.840]  And glass is expensive too.
[03:51.840 --> 03:53.840]  Do you think you still got the spin technique mastered?
[03:53.840 --> 03:57.840]  I like to think I do, but I don't know if it's like riding a bike or not.
[03:57.840 --> 03:59.840]  I'd have to kind of figure it out.
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.840]  I would take like a couple of days off and I'd get, I'd notice a difference back in the day.
[04:03.840 --> 04:05.840]  I've got these big fumbly, wookie hands.
[04:05.840 --> 04:06.840]  I can't.
[04:06.840 --> 04:14.840]  So when you're blowing glass, you guys, I do not, I know very, very little about making glass, but when you're blowing glass, you got to turn it.
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.840]  You have to turn your right hand and your left hand at the same time, and you got to have the torch in the middle-ish or whatever section you're heating.
[04:19.840 --> 04:22.840]  And if one hand spins faster than the other, your shit starts twisting.
[04:22.840 --> 04:26.840]  And if one hand goes higher than the other, your piece starts bending.
[04:26.840 --> 04:33.840]  And there's a flame in front of you and it's hot and your muscles start twitching because you're doing the same thing.
[04:33.840 --> 04:34.840]  So it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[04:34.840 --> 04:37.840]  But so shout out to the people who do do the twist.
[04:37.840 --> 04:38.840]  Yeah.
[04:38.840 --> 04:39.840]  Yeah.
[04:39.840 --> 04:40.840]  So, man, your work was great.
[04:40.840 --> 04:41.840]  So I hope you get back into it.
[04:41.840 --> 04:42.840]  I appreciate you, man.
[04:42.840 --> 04:44.840]  Hopefully I'll be able to do it one day.
[04:44.840 --> 04:45.840]  I'm sure you will.
[04:45.840 --> 04:47.840]  Let's talk about your new venture now.
[04:47.840 --> 04:55.840]  One of the things that I wrote down that I wanted to make sure we cover is that you went from a basement grow to a large facility in a very short time.
[04:55.840 --> 04:57.840]  So how long did you're from North Carolina, right?
[04:57.840 --> 04:58.840]  Yes.
[04:58.840 --> 05:00.840]  Did you grow ganja in North Carolina?
[05:00.840 --> 05:01.840]  I did.
[05:01.840 --> 05:04.840]  I kind of like had did it for a few years there.
[05:04.840 --> 05:06.840]  Not successfully for the first year.
[05:06.840 --> 05:08.840]  Tried in Asheville and just failed miserably.
[05:08.840 --> 05:16.840]  Got it into flower and then like sprayed cow mag on the plants as a foliar one day and like totally like just I don't really don't know what I was thinking.
[05:16.840 --> 05:22.840]  It was one of those just had no nobody to ask, no nothing to do and thought that was how I don't know.
[05:22.840 --> 05:23.840]  So killed those plants.
[05:23.840 --> 05:24.840]  You learned.
[05:24.840 --> 05:25.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[05:25.840 --> 05:31.840]  And then when I lived in Charlotte, I had an apartment and I got a tent and started growing in my closet.
[05:31.840 --> 05:33.840]  I actually got some genetics.
[05:33.840 --> 05:37.840]  So it was some some I read genetics back in the day.
[05:37.840 --> 05:39.840]  So this couldn't have been too long ago.
[05:39.840 --> 05:40.840]  No, it was about.
[05:40.840 --> 05:43.840]  Let's see, I've been here for about a year and a half.
[05:43.840 --> 05:45.840]  So it would have been about two and a half years ago.
[05:45.840 --> 05:46.840]  Yeah, all right.
[05:46.840 --> 05:48.840]  That was going to be one of my next questions is how long you've been here.
[05:48.840 --> 05:50.840]  So you grew in Charlotte then?
[05:50.840 --> 05:51.840]  Yes.
[05:51.840 --> 05:52.840]  Successfully.
[05:52.840 --> 05:53.840]  Yes, yes.
[05:53.840 --> 05:54.840]  I have a couple of harvests there in my closet.
[05:54.840 --> 05:55.840]  Which strain did you pull off?
[05:55.840 --> 05:56.840]  Heart of gold.
[05:56.840 --> 05:57.840]  Awesome.
[05:57.840 --> 05:58.840]  That's an easy one to grow too.
[05:58.840 --> 05:59.840]  I love that one.
[05:59.840 --> 06:00.840]  Nice.
[06:00.840 --> 06:01.840]  Yeah, it's a good one.
[06:01.840 --> 06:02.840]  It's a golden goat and grateful dog.
[06:02.840 --> 06:03.840]  It's a super good cross.
[06:03.840 --> 06:05.840]  So I have a place in my heart for golden goat because of that strain specifically.
[06:05.840 --> 06:06.840]  Nice.
[06:06.840 --> 06:07.840]  Yeah.
[06:07.840 --> 06:09.840]  I may have a golden goat clone in the future for you if you remind me.
[06:09.840 --> 06:11.840]  Yeah, I'm going to take clones of her in just a few nights here.
[06:11.840 --> 06:12.840]  So yeah, remind me of that.
[06:12.840 --> 06:15.840]  So you pull off a couple of harvests there.
[06:15.840 --> 06:18.840]  And how sketchy is that growing in North Carolina?
[06:18.840 --> 06:20.840]  It's pretty sketchy.
[06:20.840 --> 06:24.840]  The way I was doing it, I mean, I had a little CFL hood thing.
[06:24.840 --> 06:25.840]  It was like a really low key.
[06:25.840 --> 06:27.840]  Didn't put off a lot of heat.
[06:27.840 --> 06:29.840]  I had four little plants in my little tent.
[06:29.840 --> 06:31.840]  It was like a two by four tent I think.
[06:31.840 --> 06:32.840]  It was pretty small.
[06:32.840 --> 06:37.840]  But if I was doing like a basement grow or something, yeah, that would be real sketchy.
[06:37.840 --> 06:38.840]  Okay.
[06:38.840 --> 06:39.840]  I don't know.
[06:39.840 --> 06:40.840]  Yeah, people talk there too.
[06:40.840 --> 06:41.840]  Yeah.
[06:41.840 --> 06:42.840]  Yeah.
[06:42.840 --> 06:43.840]  I've met so many.
[06:43.840 --> 06:47.840]  Everybody that I've met from North Carolina like Spence, Maddie, Slop is kind of from
[06:47.840 --> 06:51.840]  North Carolina, Fong, all you folks.
[06:51.840 --> 06:53.840]  Was Tater from North Carolina?
[06:53.840 --> 06:54.840]  Yeah, I think so.
[06:54.840 --> 06:55.840]  Yeah.
[06:55.840 --> 06:56.840]  Yeah, see all you folks that I met from North Carolina.
[06:56.840 --> 06:57.840]  I'm sure I missed a few people guys.
[06:57.840 --> 06:58.840]  I'm sorry.
[06:58.840 --> 06:59.840]  There's so many of you.
[06:59.840 --> 07:00.840]  You guys are all awesome.
[07:00.840 --> 07:01.840]  We're getting Tans and Slater out here now.
[07:01.840 --> 07:02.840]  Danny.
[07:02.840 --> 07:03.840]  Yeah.
[07:03.840 --> 07:04.840]  They're all super great dudes.
[07:04.840 --> 07:05.840]  Like every one of you guys.
[07:05.840 --> 07:06.840]  Yeah.
[07:06.840 --> 07:07.840]  So yeah, super rad people from North Carolina.
[07:07.840 --> 07:10.840]  And I knew of other people from other outside of your crew that are just super awesome.
[07:10.840 --> 07:11.840]  But like your guys' whole town moved here.
[07:11.840 --> 07:12.840]  That was fun.
[07:12.840 --> 07:15.840]  There's a ghost town now with no cool people there.
[07:15.840 --> 07:16.840]  All the shitty people just stayed.
[07:16.840 --> 07:18.840]  All the cool people can't ride over here.
[07:18.840 --> 07:19.840]  Exactly.
[07:19.840 --> 07:20.840]  All right.
[07:20.840 --> 07:21.840]  So you've been here for about a year and a half.
[07:21.840 --> 07:22.840]  Yeah.
[07:22.840 --> 07:25.840]  Since May of 2015, I guess.
[07:25.840 --> 07:26.840]  Yeah, 2015.
[07:26.840 --> 07:29.840]  How long did it take you to get a gross set up when you got here?
[07:29.840 --> 07:30.840]  It was like the first thing I did.
[07:30.840 --> 07:31.840]  I like not even kidding.
[07:31.840 --> 07:35.840]  I got here and like day one went out into the shed in the backyard, started gutting
[07:35.840 --> 07:37.840]  it out, took down all the shelves, put up mylar.
[07:37.840 --> 07:39.840]  All the shit still in the U-Haul truck.
[07:39.840 --> 07:40.840]  You're like, we'll unload that in later.
[07:40.840 --> 07:41.840]  I didn't even bring a U-Haul.
[07:41.840 --> 07:42.840]  I just packed my car up and drove out here.
[07:42.840 --> 07:43.840]  Nice.
[07:43.840 --> 07:44.840]  I love people that do that.
[07:44.840 --> 07:45.840]  Yeah.
[07:45.840 --> 07:46.840]  Nice.
[07:46.840 --> 07:47.840]  I'm glad it worked out for you.
[07:47.840 --> 07:48.840]  A lot of people came out and weren't able to put it together.
[07:48.840 --> 07:49.840]  So I'm glad you're motivated.
[07:49.840 --> 07:50.840]  Motivated potheads.
[07:50.840 --> 07:51.840]  Yes.
[07:51.840 --> 07:52.840]  All right.
[07:52.840 --> 07:53.840]  So how long did it take you?
[07:53.840 --> 07:56.840]  So you blew glass for like about six or eight months, it seemed like.
[07:56.840 --> 07:57.840]  Yeah, about six, seven months.
[07:57.840 --> 07:58.840]  Okay.
[07:58.840 --> 07:59.840]  I was paying attention.
[07:59.840 --> 08:02.840]  And then you got into, how did, tell us where you're working now with the large facility.
[08:02.840 --> 08:04.840]  I am now at Ascend Cannabis Company.
[08:04.840 --> 08:05.840]  It's a-
[08:05.840 --> 08:06.840]  That's a cool name.
[08:06.840 --> 08:08.840]  I was going to use that for a strain name, but it became Arise.
[08:08.840 --> 08:10.840]  I remember I was here when we were talking about that.
[08:10.840 --> 08:12.840]  But yeah, it's Ascend Cannabis Company.
[08:12.840 --> 08:14.840]  We have our dispensary up in Lakewood.
[08:14.840 --> 08:18.840]  Our grow greenhouse is here in Pueblo.
[08:18.840 --> 08:19.840]  It's really big.
[08:19.840 --> 08:20.840]  Huge facility.
[08:20.840 --> 08:21.840]  It's pretty sweet.
[08:21.840 --> 08:23.840]  Definitely a big step up from the basement.
[08:23.840 --> 08:25.840]  How many plants are you in charge of?
[08:25.840 --> 08:28.840]  I have 320 plants in flower at all times that I'm in charge of.
[08:28.840 --> 08:29.840]  In flower.
[08:29.840 --> 08:30.840]  What size pots?
[08:30.840 --> 08:31.840]  20 gallons.
[08:31.840 --> 08:32.840]  20 gallons.
[08:32.840 --> 08:33.840]  So those are huge plants.
[08:33.840 --> 08:34.840]  Those aren't just little baby plants.
[08:34.840 --> 08:35.840]  Yes, they're pretty big plants.
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.840]  In the summer, it's not uncommon to see like every plant hit a half pound.
[08:39.840 --> 08:40.840]  Wow.
[08:40.840 --> 08:41.840]  Yeah.
[08:41.840 --> 08:46.840]  How often in the summer at peak harvest or at peak flowering, how often do those plants
[08:46.840 --> 08:47.840]  need to be watered?
[08:47.840 --> 08:49.840]  We water every other day.
[08:49.840 --> 08:52.840]  Sometimes the plants like in the center of the greenhouse where they get more sun and
[08:52.840 --> 08:53.840]  more light every single day.
[08:53.840 --> 08:54.840]  Wow.
[08:54.840 --> 08:55.840]  In the middle of the summer.
[08:55.840 --> 08:56.840]  Yeah, we had a lot of, we had a couple of beds that we were hitting every single day
[08:56.840 --> 08:57.840]  of the summer.
[08:57.840 --> 09:00.840]  Do you know how many gallons of water you're throwing in a 20 gallon pot?
[09:00.840 --> 09:02.840]  It's around two and a half gallons per, I believe.
[09:02.840 --> 09:03.840]  Oh, okay.
[09:03.840 --> 09:04.840]  I honestly expected more.
[09:04.840 --> 09:05.840]  Maybe.
[09:05.840 --> 09:06.840]  Maybe I'm doing my math wrong.
[09:06.840 --> 09:10.840]  But we have, it's 300 gallons for 120 plants every other day.
[09:10.840 --> 09:11.840]  Okay.
[09:11.840 --> 09:12.840]  So.
[09:12.840 --> 09:13.840]  Because it's two, we, our bed has 160 plants in it.
[09:13.840 --> 09:14.840]  It's two and a fraction.
[09:14.840 --> 09:15.840]  I'm not going to try to do math while I'm talking.
[09:15.840 --> 09:16.840]  Yeah, something like that.
[09:16.840 --> 09:17.840]  Yeah, two and a half inch.
[09:17.840 --> 09:18.840]  I'm reading notes and trying to look at you.
[09:18.840 --> 09:19.840]  I'm not going to do that much math.
[09:19.840 --> 09:20.840]  All right.
[09:20.840 --> 09:23.840]  So is that like a good solid eight to 10 hours of work?
[09:23.840 --> 09:24.840]  Like every day?
[09:24.840 --> 09:25.840]  Yeah.
[09:25.840 --> 09:26.840]  Yeah, basically.
[09:26.840 --> 09:31.840]  We, we're there every single day from seven o'clock until on a good day, we got it four,
[09:31.840 --> 09:32.840]  430.
[09:32.840 --> 09:33.840]  Nice.
[09:33.840 --> 09:34.840]  And that's every single day.
[09:34.840 --> 09:35.840]  Plus like a little bit of a drive because it's not right in town.
[09:35.840 --> 09:36.840]  Yeah, no, it's out in the county a little bit.
[09:37.840 --> 09:38.840]  Yeah.
[09:38.840 --> 09:39.840]  It's beautiful spots out there.
[09:39.840 --> 09:40.840]  I love it out there.
[09:40.840 --> 09:41.840]  I went for a drive.
[09:41.840 --> 09:42.840]  I took a friend of mine to go see the leaves change.
[09:42.840 --> 09:43.840]  Shout out to JB.
[09:43.840 --> 09:47.840]  I took her to go see the leaves change colors out by toward the castle.
[09:47.840 --> 09:48.840]  And we went to the castle.
[09:48.840 --> 09:49.840]  Luckily we went before the fires.
[09:49.840 --> 09:50.840]  Oh my God.
[09:50.840 --> 09:51.840]  It's still raging.
[09:51.840 --> 09:52.840]  I can see it at work.
[09:52.840 --> 09:53.840]  Yeah.
[09:53.840 --> 09:54.840]  Yeah.
[09:54.840 --> 09:55.840]  Big, big shout out to all the people that have to deal with those fires.
[09:55.840 --> 09:56.840]  I feel so bad for you.
[09:56.840 --> 09:59.840]  My whole vibe just changed when I thought about it, but we went out there and there are, if
[09:59.840 --> 10:02.840]  you're paying attention, there are so many grows out there.
[10:03.840 --> 10:06.840]  There's a grow every five miles off to the left or the right side of the interstate.
[10:06.840 --> 10:08.840]  Some of them are super high tech and fancy.
[10:08.840 --> 10:13.840]  Some of them are a little jank, but there are so many grows out there from, from Pueblo
[10:13.840 --> 10:16.840]  to all the way into almost to the castle.
[10:16.840 --> 10:19.840]  There's a grow on highway 96 to the left or the right all the time.
[10:19.840 --> 10:23.840]  So you guys, if you've got to take your girlfriends out there or your significant other, or your
[10:23.840 --> 10:26.840]  side chick or your boo, you got to take them out on a road trip to go look at the leaves
[10:26.840 --> 10:27.840]  in Colorado.
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.840]  Go drive up highway 96 between Pueblo and like wet more, and then keep going even further
[10:32.840 --> 10:37.840]  up into Westcliff and look at all of the grows on the left and right side of the inter on
[10:37.840 --> 10:39.840]  the highway while your girl's looking at all the leaves.
[10:39.840 --> 10:40.840]  It's amazing.
[10:40.840 --> 10:41.840]  You'll enjoy it.
[10:41.840 --> 10:42.840]  Definitely.
[10:42.840 --> 10:43.840]  All right.
[10:43.840 --> 10:47.840]  So one thing I wanted to talk about, you started off in a basement grow like most growers do.
[10:47.840 --> 10:50.840]  You start off in a tent like a lot of growers do, graduated to a basement.
[10:50.840 --> 10:51.840]  I've seen your pictures.
[10:51.840 --> 10:52.840]  You crush it.
[10:52.840 --> 10:54.840]  You grew some Kalonji Kush that was gorgeous.
[10:54.840 --> 10:55.840]  I'm proud of that one.
[10:55.840 --> 10:56.840]  Yeah.
[10:56.840 --> 10:57.840]  That's one of my favorites too.
[10:57.840 --> 10:58.840]  I love that.
[10:58.840 --> 10:59.840]  It's two of my favorite strains put together.
[10:59.840 --> 11:00.840]  It's Tahoe, G and Grateful Dog.
[11:00.840 --> 11:01.840]  So you can't really go wrong right there.
[11:01.840 --> 11:02.840]  Shout out to Swerve.
[11:02.840 --> 11:03.840]  I got both those from Swerve.
[11:03.840 --> 11:04.840]  Where the hell was I going with this?
[11:04.840 --> 11:11.840]  Let's talk about some of the stuff that you learned that is different, that you had to
[11:11.840 --> 11:16.840]  adjust major differences you've noticed and learned going from like a small grow in your
[11:16.840 --> 11:18.840]  basement to this big gigantic facility.
[11:18.840 --> 11:19.840]  You said you had a greenhouse.
[11:19.840 --> 11:21.840]  Do you know how many square feet that greenhouse is?
[11:21.840 --> 11:23.840]  I've asked a couple of people.
[11:23.840 --> 11:29.840]  I don't always know for sure what it is, but we have two flower rooms and in each flower
[11:29.840 --> 11:33.840]  room there is 640 plants and 20 gallons into our raised bed.
[11:33.840 --> 11:35.840]  We've got a couple of raised beds.
[11:35.840 --> 11:37.840]  Do you prefer the raised beds or the-
[11:37.840 --> 11:38.840]  The raised bed all day.
[11:38.840 --> 11:39.840]  Okay.
[11:39.840 --> 11:40.840]  Spencer seems to be loving those too.
[11:40.840 --> 11:41.840]  Shout out to the Garden of Weed Mountain in Washington.
[11:41.840 --> 11:42.840]  They're so awesome.
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.840]  Yeah.
[11:43.840 --> 11:44.840]  Okay.
[11:44.840 --> 11:45.840]  What's better about them?
[11:45.840 --> 11:47.840]  It's just the way we do them.
[11:47.840 --> 11:49.840]  Our raised beds are fed differently than we do our 20s.
[11:50.840 --> 11:55.840]  We actually get the Mbessa compost teas and we use those and we brew those, but for the
[11:55.840 --> 11:57.840]  raised bed it's been no-till and it's been going no-till.
[11:57.840 --> 12:01.840]  We haven't added any soil to it other than what goes in with the transplants.
[12:01.840 --> 12:04.840]  It's been like that since the opening of the greenhouse, I think two years ago.
[12:04.840 --> 12:05.840]  Wow.
[12:05.840 --> 12:07.840]  And it's full of life because we're all organic.
[12:07.840 --> 12:10.840]  It's full of life, full of microbes and it's just really cool.
[12:10.840 --> 12:14.840]  The plants seem- they get a little bit bigger in the raised bed too.
[12:14.840 --> 12:18.840]  They've got more space for the roots to get out and the flowers just always seem to be
[12:18.840 --> 12:19.840]  a little bit better out of the raised bed.
[12:19.840 --> 12:20.840]  Wow.
[12:20.840 --> 12:21.840]  That's really cool.
[12:21.840 --> 12:23.840]  We're trying to transition into complete all raised beds.
[12:23.840 --> 12:24.840]  Okay.
[12:24.840 --> 12:25.840]  Keeping that life going in there.
[12:25.840 --> 12:26.840]  Yeah.
[12:26.840 --> 12:27.840]  Yeah.
[12:27.840 --> 12:28.840]  It's awesome.
[12:28.840 --> 12:29.840]  All right.
[12:29.840 --> 12:30.840]  We'll talk more about that when we get to the next part here.
[12:30.840 --> 12:31.840]  So let's talk more about some of the stuff that you had to change and that you've noticed
[12:31.840 --> 12:32.840]  going to the big grow.
[12:32.840 --> 12:33.840]  Yeah.
[12:33.840 --> 12:34.840]  It's pretty crazy.
[12:34.840 --> 12:39.840]  The biggest I've ever had in my house is a 4K in the basement and now we've got- what
[12:39.840 --> 12:40.840]  is it?
[12:40.840 --> 12:41.840]  I've got to run down here.
[12:41.840 --> 12:44.840]  We have 112 Govitas in each room.
[12:44.840 --> 12:45.840]  So we've got 224 lights.
[12:45.840 --> 12:50.840]  So I'm going from four lights to 224 now and just getting used to the size of the plants
[12:50.840 --> 12:54.840]  and how often I got to water them and how much I got to water them really changed.
[12:54.840 --> 13:00.840]  It was just basically- it put into perspective how little I actually was doing at my house.
[13:00.840 --> 13:01.840]  Right.
[13:01.840 --> 13:02.840]  It made my growing at home a lot easier to be honest.
[13:02.840 --> 13:03.840]  Oh yeah.
[13:03.840 --> 13:04.840]  Yeah.
[13:04.840 --> 13:05.840]  I feel the same.
[13:05.840 --> 13:06.840]  I've got a hobby grow now.
[13:06.840 --> 13:07.840]  Exactly.
[13:07.840 --> 13:09.840]  It's like, wow, I used to think that watering these 20 plants was hard.
[13:09.840 --> 13:10.840]  Right.
[13:10.840 --> 13:14.840]  I was like, oh, I got to water my 20 plants now, but now I'm watering 320.
[13:14.840 --> 13:15.840]  320 every day.
[13:15.840 --> 13:16.840]  Yeah.
[13:16.840 --> 13:21.840]  Doing maintenance on them, defoliating, checking for bugs, making sure there's no problems,
[13:21.840 --> 13:23.840]  putting supporting sticks everywhere you need to.
[13:23.840 --> 13:24.840]  Oh, stake city.
[13:24.840 --> 13:25.840]  Yeah.
[13:25.840 --> 13:28.840]  It's an MED grow, so you got to make sure that everything is tagged properly.
[13:28.840 --> 13:29.840]  Yeah.
[13:29.840 --> 13:30.840]  That was one thing that was really crazy.
[13:30.840 --> 13:34.840]  It was going and getting- because I had never done anything other than a basement grow until
[13:34.840 --> 13:35.840]  I got here.
[13:35.840 --> 13:38.840]  Like I never worked in any dispensary.
[13:38.840 --> 13:39.840]  I've never been in the industry ever.
[13:39.840 --> 13:41.840]  I got my badge and started working there.
[13:42.840 --> 13:48.840]  That was one thing that was crazy was seeing how heavily everything has to be tagged, tracked.
[13:48.840 --> 13:52.840]  If you get rid of it, you have to make sure that you get rid of it in the computer and
[13:52.840 --> 13:55.840]  throw it in the right basket and incinerate the basket.
[13:55.840 --> 13:59.840]  That was crazy to me.
[13:59.840 --> 14:00.840]  Yeah.
[14:00.840 --> 14:01.840]  It's still crazy to me.
[14:01.840 --> 14:03.840]  It's overkill, but I like the overkill kind of.
[14:03.840 --> 14:04.840]  Me too.
[14:04.840 --> 14:05.840]  Me too.
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.840]  I feel like it keeps everybody in check and it keeps the people that shouldn't be doing
[14:09.840 --> 14:11.840]  it, it keeps them kind of at bay.
[14:11.840 --> 14:12.840]  It creates a standard.
[14:12.840 --> 14:13.840]  Exactly.
[14:13.840 --> 14:16.840]  If you can't live up to that standard, then you shouldn't be growing this product.
[14:16.840 --> 14:17.840]  This is a medical product.
[14:17.840 --> 14:21.840]  It's also a recreational product for a lot of people, but I think that recreational use
[14:21.840 --> 14:22.840]  is also medical.
[14:22.840 --> 14:23.840]  Yeah, for sure.
[14:23.840 --> 14:24.840]  If that makes sense.
[14:24.840 --> 14:25.840]  Definitely.
[14:25.840 --> 14:26.840]  Yeah.
[14:26.840 --> 14:27.840]  It's my recreational- yeah.
[14:27.840 --> 14:28.840]  It's my freedom.
[14:28.840 --> 14:29.840]  It's my vice.
[14:29.840 --> 14:30.840]  It's my fun.
[14:30.840 --> 14:31.840]  Yeah, it's my vice.
[14:31.840 --> 14:32.840]  It's my fun.
[14:32.840 --> 14:35.840]  I'm getting too old to go to too many concerts and go do ridiculous shit.
[14:35.840 --> 14:37.840]  I'm going to take some dabs and play on my phone.
[14:37.840 --> 14:38.840]  There you go.
[14:38.840 --> 14:40.840]  I'm cool with that for a minute sometimes now.
[14:40.840 --> 14:42.840]  Yeah, it's my recreational outlet.
[14:42.840 --> 14:45.840]  Man, 320 giant plants.
[14:45.840 --> 14:46.840]  Yes.
[14:46.840 --> 14:47.840]  You defoliate that all yourself?
[14:47.840 --> 14:48.840]  Pest management all yourself?
[14:48.840 --> 14:50.840]  There's six of us that work there.
[14:50.840 --> 14:52.840]  There's six growers.
[14:52.840 --> 14:59.840]  We have 1,280 plants in flower and about 700 in veg, 400 in the T5s, and another 600 clones.
[14:59.840 --> 15:00.840]  Wow.
[15:00.840 --> 15:01.840]  Six of us manage that.
[15:01.840 --> 15:06.840]  We have our spray days on Wednesday and Saturday.
[15:07.840 --> 15:10.840]  I think I sent you that sprayer we had that one time you saw that.
[15:10.840 --> 15:11.840]  Yeah.
[15:11.840 --> 15:12.840]  The crazy one.
[15:12.840 --> 15:13.840]  It's huge.
[15:13.840 --> 15:21.840]  Everybody rotates how we spray, but we spray two days a week all the way through up until the last week.
[15:21.840 --> 15:23.840]  We are, like I said, all organic.
[15:23.840 --> 15:26.840]  We're spraying 100% organic neem oil and 100% organic essentials.
[15:26.840 --> 15:28.840]  No chemicals or nothing on there.
[15:28.840 --> 15:29.840]  Awesome.
[15:29.840 --> 15:30.840]  It's all food.
[15:30.840 --> 15:31.840]  All right.
[15:31.840 --> 15:34.840]  Let's transition to that part because that's something that I've definitely noticed since
[15:34.840 --> 15:36.840]  you started working at this place.
[15:36.840 --> 15:39.840]  Your home grow has completely switched to fully organic now, right?
[15:39.840 --> 15:40.840]  Yes, 100%.
[15:40.840 --> 15:42.840]  Was that inspired by this place?
[15:42.840 --> 15:44.840]  It was inspired by a few different things, to be honest.
[15:44.840 --> 15:48.840]  I started working there, and when I got in the grow, I was watering my plants, and so I needed something to listen to.
[15:48.840 --> 15:53.840]  I started listening to old podcast episodes of yours that I hadn't listened to since I lived in North Carolina.
[15:53.840 --> 15:54.840]  I figured I've learned a couple new things.
[15:54.840 --> 15:56.840]  Let me see if I can take anything new from these.
[15:56.840 --> 15:59.840]  I was listening to the episodes of when Sean came on.
[15:59.840 --> 16:01.840]  Sean, shout out to King Cola.
[16:01.840 --> 16:02.840]  Yeah.
[16:02.840 --> 16:03.840]  He was so passionate about it.
[16:03.840 --> 16:04.840]  That was kind of cool to me.
[16:04.840 --> 16:06.840]  I was like, oh, these things are pretty cool.
[16:06.840 --> 16:07.840]  I'm learning about what I'm doing here.
[16:07.840 --> 16:08.840]  I'm doing my work.
[16:08.840 --> 16:10.840]  Then I also started hanging out with Frosty.
[16:10.840 --> 16:11.840]  Frosty Organics.
[16:11.840 --> 16:12.840]  Frosty Organics.
[16:12.840 --> 16:13.840]  Shout out to Frosty.
[16:13.840 --> 16:14.840]  He's the same way.
[16:14.840 --> 16:15.840]  He's super passionate about it.
[16:15.840 --> 16:18.840]  He was throwing, dropping knowledge on me every day.
[16:18.840 --> 16:20.840]  One day I just was like, you know what?
[16:20.840 --> 16:28.840]  I had my outdoor going, and I was like, I'm going to do a raised bed, no-till, organic, outdoor for the summer and see how much I like organic, and I might switch to it.
[16:28.840 --> 16:29.840]  Then I was like, you know what?
[16:29.840 --> 16:31.840]  Why don't I just completely go organic?
[16:32.840 --> 16:34.840]  I feel like it's so much—I know it's better.
[16:34.840 --> 16:37.840]  I know it's just—I don't know.
[16:37.840 --> 16:45.840]  I made the switch completely, and now that I've been doing it, I've had one full, complete from—because I switched halfway through a cycle.
[16:45.840 --> 16:46.840]  I was like, you know what?
[16:46.840 --> 16:47.840]  I'm not going to use these bottles anymore.
[16:47.840 --> 16:48.840]  I'm organic now.
[16:48.840 --> 16:49.840]  Nice.
[16:49.840 --> 16:52.840]  I had plants and veg, and then plants halfway through flower.
[16:52.840 --> 16:53.840]  Went through that cycle.
[16:53.840 --> 16:55.840]  Plants and veg came through, and I went through it.
[16:56.840 --> 16:57.840]  I'm doing this now, just like last week.
[16:57.840 --> 17:01.840]  Took it on my first from seed to harvest, like 100% fully organic.
[17:01.840 --> 17:02.840]  Sweet.
[17:02.840 --> 17:04.840]  It's by far the best grow I've ever had.
[17:04.840 --> 17:05.840]  Best personal grow I've ever had.
[17:05.840 --> 17:06.840]  That's great to hear.
[17:06.840 --> 17:07.840]  Nice.
[17:07.840 --> 17:08.840]  Congrats.
[17:08.840 --> 17:09.840]  Thank you.
[17:09.840 --> 17:10.840]  You're going to continue that path for sure.
[17:10.840 --> 17:11.840]  Oh, yeah, 100%.
[17:11.840 --> 17:13.840]  Are you going to eventually turn your home grow into no-till?
[17:13.840 --> 17:14.840]  Yeah, that's what I want to do.
[17:14.840 --> 17:16.840]  I'm doing no-till soil right now.
[17:16.840 --> 17:18.840]  I'm reusing the soil that I have in the pots.
[17:18.840 --> 17:21.840]  I'm using seven-gallon pots and just taking the root ball out and putting the two gals in.
[17:21.840 --> 17:25.840]  Do you want to teach my listeners just briefly a quick lesson on no-till?
[17:25.840 --> 17:27.840]  Because I don't think we've covered too much no-till on the podcast.
[17:27.840 --> 17:28.840]  Sure.
[17:28.840 --> 17:29.840]  I'll say as much as I know.
[17:29.840 --> 17:30.840]  I'm by no means an expert on it.
[17:30.840 --> 17:31.840]  I'm new to this thing as well.
[17:31.840 --> 17:37.840]  Basically, no-till soil is when you have a soil that you've amended yourself, and you've planted the plant in it.
[17:37.840 --> 17:43.840]  You just feed it top dressings and whatever teas you want to do, whatever you got to do.
[17:43.840 --> 17:44.840]  You've got worms in there.
[17:44.840 --> 17:46.840]  You've got a lot of microbe life going in there.
[17:46.840 --> 17:49.840]  It's after three years, I believe, that you've been running this soil.
[17:50.840 --> 17:53.840]  You never actually take the soil up or put new soil.
[17:53.840 --> 18:01.840]  You reuse the soil every time, just taking the root ball out and putting a new plant in, reusing the old dirt, trying to just no-till.
[18:01.840 --> 18:04.840]  You want to irritate the land as little as possible.
[18:04.840 --> 18:07.840]  After three years, it's basically self-sustaining.
[18:07.840 --> 18:09.840]  All you need to do is add water.
[18:09.840 --> 18:10.840]  Wow.
[18:10.840 --> 18:11.840]  Yeah.
[18:11.840 --> 18:13.840]  With the no-till, it's just you've got a lot of microbe life living in there.
[18:13.840 --> 18:15.840]  You've got a lot of microorganisms breaking everything down.
[18:15.840 --> 18:24.840]  Your plants are really, really, really going to thrive in a well-maintained no-till environment because you're not really feeding your plants at that point.
[18:24.840 --> 18:33.840]  You're feeding these microorganisms that live in your soil, and then they're going to absorb all these things that you're feeding them, release them back into the soil, and that's what your plants are going to uptake.
[18:33.840 --> 18:35.840]  It's a cycle of life.
[18:35.840 --> 18:39.840]  It's how things are meant to be, and you're just carefully maintaining it there.
[18:39.840 --> 18:41.840]  It allows the plant to eat what it wants.
[18:41.840 --> 18:42.840]  Exactly.
[18:42.840 --> 18:43.840]  Exactly the ratios it wants.
[18:43.840 --> 18:44.840]  You're not force-feeding it some bottle.
[18:44.840 --> 18:48.840]  You're not holding it down, putting a nipple on a bottle, trying to shove some formula in its mouth.
[18:48.840 --> 18:49.840]  Yeah.
[18:49.840 --> 18:50.840]  That's beautiful.
[18:50.840 --> 18:51.840]  Yeah.
[18:51.840 --> 18:52.840]  Okay.
[18:52.840 --> 18:57.840]  How long does it take to ... Can I almost take ... If I grow a crop now that's not no-till, because it's not amended, so I can't do it.
[18:57.840 --> 18:58.840]  Never mind.
[18:58.840 --> 18:59.840]  I think I know the answer.
[18:59.840 --> 19:04.840]  I was going to ask if I could take a plant that I'm going to harvest tomorrow, chop the plant, pull the root ball out.
[19:04.840 --> 19:10.840]  Can I now start my no-till process with that soil, or do I need to pre-prep my pot at the beginning?
[19:10.840 --> 19:15.840]  You probably could, but it would probably be best to start it in an amended soil.
[19:15.840 --> 19:19.840]  That way, you've already got ... Your soil is already inoculated.
[19:19.840 --> 19:24.840]  You've got life all the way from the top to the bottom, because if you're just throwing a new plant in there at that point, you're just ...
[19:24.840 --> 19:32.840]  It's going to take a couple weeks for it to take off, really, because it's not going to have any of the ... There's no life in there to give it food.
[19:32.840 --> 19:33.840]  Right.
[19:33.840 --> 19:34.840]  It's got to fire up.
[19:34.840 --> 19:35.840]  Exactly.
[19:35.840 --> 19:36.840]  It's got to get going.
[19:36.840 --> 19:37.840]  It's got to create that life.
[19:37.840 --> 19:39.840]  It's going to be searching for the food, and it's not going to take off for probably a week or two.
[19:39.840 --> 19:40.840]  It sounds like a great method.
[19:40.840 --> 19:41.840]  It could do it.
[19:41.840 --> 19:42.840]  That's for sure.
[19:42.840 --> 19:43.840]  Sounds like a great method.
[19:43.840 --> 19:44.840]  Shout out to Lindsay, the Traveling Stoner.
[19:44.840 --> 19:46.840]  She just called while we're trying to do a podcast.
[19:46.840 --> 19:47.840]  Lindsay, I hope you're listening.
[19:47.840 --> 19:49.840]  I'll call you back after we get done recording.
[19:49.840 --> 19:54.840]  She was not live, but she definitely listens to every episode, so she'll share this part.
[19:54.840 --> 19:55.840]  I know what she wants.
[19:55.840 --> 19:56.840]  I know what she wants to talk about.
[19:56.840 --> 19:58.840]  She got a new carb cap in that I'm excited about.
[19:58.840 --> 20:00.840]  I think it's called a clit cap.
[20:00.840 --> 20:02.840]  It's in the shape of a vagina.
[20:02.840 --> 20:03.840]  There you go.
[20:03.840 --> 20:05.840]  It's a carb cap, and it looks like a vagina on the rig.
[20:05.840 --> 20:07.840]  She wants to take the ebbs and use that.
[20:08.840 --> 20:09.840]  Where are we on my notes?
[20:09.840 --> 20:10.840]  We got distracted here.
[20:10.840 --> 20:12.840]  No-till, that sounds great.
[20:12.840 --> 20:13.840]  I want to get into that.
[20:13.840 --> 20:14.840]  It sounds like something that's sustainable.
[20:14.840 --> 20:15.840]  It's fun.
[20:15.840 --> 20:16.840]  It's cool.
[20:16.840 --> 20:17.840]  You learn a lot.
[20:17.840 --> 20:18.840]  It's fun.
[20:18.840 --> 20:19.840]  I don't know.
[20:19.840 --> 20:20.840]  It's really hard to explain.
[20:20.840 --> 20:23.840]  You just get a better ... You feel more like ... It sounds cheesy, but you feel more in-sync
[20:23.840 --> 20:26.840]  with your plants when you're controlling their environment.
[20:26.840 --> 20:31.840]  I did sort of ... When Sean was here often, and we all got it, when I was being sponsored
[20:31.840 --> 20:34.840]  by the Rocky Mountain Worm Company, big shout out to Jay from the Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[20:35.840 --> 20:38.840]  They were sponsoring me, and they were actually giving me all of the amendments that I needed
[20:38.840 --> 20:40.840]  to do everything organically.
[20:40.840 --> 20:43.840]  I really loved my product, and I loved ... I felt like a farmer.
[20:43.840 --> 20:44.840]  You know what I mean?
[20:44.840 --> 20:45.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[20:45.840 --> 20:50.840]  I had worm shit underneath my fingernails, and I smelled like fish emulsion, and I was
[20:50.840 --> 20:51.840]  just funky.
[20:51.840 --> 20:52.840]  You know what I mean?
[20:52.840 --> 20:53.840]  It was great.
[20:53.840 --> 20:54.840]  I've got a neem and kelp tea brewing at my house right now.
[20:54.840 --> 20:58.840]  I'm going to walk in the door, and it's going to just smell that kelp meal as soon as I
[20:58.840 --> 20:59.840]  walk in.
[20:59.840 --> 21:02.840]  I love walking in, and you've got the five-gallon bucket of tea brewing, and there's foam three
[21:02.840 --> 21:03.840]  feet high off of it.
[21:03.840 --> 21:04.840]  Yeah, I love that.
[21:04.840 --> 21:05.840]  I love that.
[21:05.840 --> 21:06.840]  I love it.
[21:06.840 --> 21:12.840]  I also ran, at Green and Healthy, we did nutrients that came out of big five-gallon jugs into,
[21:12.840 --> 21:16.840]  I put them into basically a beaker, and then put those into a reservoir, and mixed it,
[21:16.840 --> 21:17.840]  and adjusted the pH.
[21:17.840 --> 21:21.840]  I did it with goggles on, and gloves, and it felt very scientific.
[21:21.840 --> 21:23.840]  I liked that as well for some fun reason.
[21:23.840 --> 21:24.840]  Yeah, it's different.
[21:24.840 --> 21:25.840]  You know what I mean?
[21:25.840 --> 21:28.840]  Now at home, I'm running ... I like botanic air bottles.
[21:28.840 --> 21:29.840]  It's simple for what I do.
[21:30.840 --> 21:34.840]  I breed, and so I don't need to do a lot of crazy shit for what I'm breeding with, and
[21:34.840 --> 21:36.840]  the botanic air is perfect.
[21:36.840 --> 21:38.840]  I like mixing the bottles a little bit.
[21:38.840 --> 21:40.840]  I put some worm castings in there.
[21:40.840 --> 21:43.840]  There's organic amendments in the soil, but when it comes time to feed a little bit, I
[21:43.840 --> 21:45.840]  grab the bottles of botanic air.
[21:45.840 --> 21:46.840]  It seems to be the easiest way for me.
[21:46.840 --> 21:49.840]  When I shift up so much, I did a bunch of veg bloom.
[21:49.840 --> 21:52.840]  I've got veg bloom that'll probably go in the next cycle.
[21:52.840 --> 21:55.840]  I've actually noticed, I wanted to save this for a whole episode.
[21:55.840 --> 21:58.840]  I've noticed that ... We'll do an episode about this.
[21:58.840 --> 22:01.840]  Certain strains actually prefer certain nutrients.
[22:01.840 --> 22:05.840]  I've noticed that if I ... Because I've ran ... I've been doing this for a long time.
[22:05.840 --> 22:09.840]  I've ran so many nutrient lines, and I've had Flo for 10 years, and I've noticed that
[22:09.840 --> 22:11.840]  if I run Flo with this brand, it acts this way.
[22:11.840 --> 22:14.840]  If I run Flo with this brand, it acts this way.
[22:14.840 --> 22:18.840]  Different brands, because I've had the same grow room set up for so long, and yeah, they'll
[22:18.840 --> 22:20.840]  change from different nutrients.
[22:20.840 --> 22:23.840]  Psycho made everything real colorful and fluffy, but I hated the flavor.
[22:23.840 --> 22:27.840]  Advanced nutrients made everything taste exactly the same, but I got huge buds, but everything
[22:28.840 --> 22:30.840]  tasted exactly the same.
[22:30.840 --> 22:33.840]  I think Advanced might have been one of the first brands I tried to use.
[22:33.840 --> 22:34.840]  Nice.
[22:34.840 --> 22:35.840]  Yeah.
[22:35.840 --> 22:36.840]  I started with Mills.
[22:36.840 --> 22:37.840]  Oh, Mills pays the bills.
[22:37.840 --> 22:38.840]  Yeah, Mills pays the bills.
[22:38.840 --> 22:39.840]  I've seen good work with Mills.
[22:39.840 --> 22:40.840]  That's what I heard.
[22:40.840 --> 22:41.840]  Yeah, it was tight.
[22:41.840 --> 22:42.840]  I liked ... It was cool.
[22:42.840 --> 22:45.840]  I liked the results that I was getting, but I don't know.
[22:45.840 --> 22:47.840]  The organic is just ... I don't know.
[22:47.840 --> 22:49.840]  Like I said, it's more fun to me.
[22:49.840 --> 22:52.840]  I feel like I'm doing more.
[22:52.840 --> 22:53.840]  I don't know.
[22:53.840 --> 22:54.840]  It's hard to explain.
[22:54.840 --> 22:56.840]  We might do ... I'm going to write no-till.
[22:56.840 --> 22:59.840]  I've grabbed this ... I've got a pencil dabber.
[22:59.840 --> 23:04.840]  This is actually ... It looks like a green colored pencil, and it's actually a glass dabber.
[23:04.840 --> 23:07.840]  I just grabbed this to try to make a note, so I'm going to reach this way and not look
[23:07.840 --> 23:09.840]  like a dumbass and grab a pen.
[23:09.840 --> 23:11.840]  There we go, and I'll make a note.
[23:11.840 --> 23:13.840]  We're going to do a no-till episode in the future.
[23:13.840 --> 23:15.840]  You can get Frosty on here for that one.
[23:15.840 --> 23:16.840]  Yeah?
[23:16.840 --> 23:17.840]  Yeah.
[23:17.840 --> 23:18.840]  Oh, okay.
[23:18.840 --> 23:19.840]  Does Frosty live in Pueblo or Springs?
[23:19.840 --> 23:20.840]  He lives in Pueblo.
[23:20.840 --> 23:21.840]  He lives in Pueblo.
[23:21.840 --> 23:22.840]  I thought he was a Springs kid.
[23:22.840 --> 23:23.840]  Frosty, why haven't you been on the podcast, bro?
[23:23.840 --> 23:24.840]  You need to get him out here for sure.
[23:24.840 --> 23:27.840]  You can text me or message me on Instagram or Facebook right now and be like, how do
[23:27.840 --> 23:28.840]  I get on your podcast?
[23:28.840 --> 23:31.840]  If not, I'll get Will to put me in touch with you, or I'll hit you up on Instagram, and
[23:31.840 --> 23:32.840]  we'll get you on the podcast.
[23:32.840 --> 23:36.840]  We'll talk about no-till, because I'm sure a lot of our listeners are like, I want to
[23:36.840 --> 23:37.840]  know the recipe for the soil.
[23:37.840 --> 23:40.840]  We're going to tease them, and we're going to make a no-till episode for that.
[23:40.840 --> 23:41.840]  That's going to be rad.
[23:41.840 --> 23:42.840]  Nice.
[23:42.840 --> 23:45.840]  Yeah, so you guys just got teased on two cool episodes that are going to be coming
[23:45.840 --> 23:46.840]  up.
[23:46.840 --> 23:47.840]  There are worms in there.
[23:47.840 --> 23:48.840]  Yes.
[23:48.840 --> 23:49.840]  Lots of worms.
[23:49.840 --> 23:50.840]  Lots and lots and lots of worms.
[23:50.840 --> 23:51.840]  How large is your raised bed?
[23:51.840 --> 23:53.840]  I'm guessing three by three or four by four?
[23:53.840 --> 23:54.840]  Like at work?
[23:54.840 --> 23:55.840]  Yeah.
[23:55.840 --> 23:58.840]  It is about three feet tall, but then it goes like-
[23:58.840 --> 23:59.840]  Oh, it's long.
[23:59.840 --> 24:00.840]  We've got to grow.
[24:00.840 --> 24:01.840]  All the way down.
[24:01.840 --> 24:02.840]  Yeah, we have 40 plants in it.
[24:02.840 --> 24:03.840]  Okay.
[24:03.840 --> 24:04.840]  So it goes, there's a really, really, really, really long-
[24:04.840 --> 24:06.840]  I was just going to ask how many worms are in there?
[24:06.840 --> 24:07.840]  How many did you put in there?
[24:07.840 --> 24:10.840]  Oh, they've been in there for, we haven't had any new worms in forever.
[24:10.840 --> 24:11.840]  They've just been in there-
[24:11.840 --> 24:12.840]  Oh, that's awesome.
[24:12.840 --> 24:13.840]  Because worms multiply pretty quickly.
[24:13.840 --> 24:14.840]  Yeah.
[24:14.840 --> 24:15.840]  Yeah, and there's so many in there.
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.840]  That's so awesome.
[24:16.840 --> 24:17.840]  Yeah, it's tight.
[24:17.840 --> 24:18.840]  Oh, man, I want to go see that.
[24:18.840 --> 24:20.840]  Yeah, you can come down and check it out if you want to.
[24:20.840 --> 24:21.840]  Okay.
[24:21.840 --> 24:22.840]  Yeah, you're more than welcome.
[24:22.840 --> 24:23.840]  I'll give you a tour.
[24:23.840 --> 24:24.840]  Yeah, sounds great to me.
[24:24.840 --> 24:25.840]  I'd love to come check it out.
[24:25.840 --> 24:27.840]  I haven't gone to enough big outdoor grows this year for some reason.
[24:27.840 --> 24:30.840]  I've got to bring you guys some genetics or, oh, we can't do that anymore.
[24:30.840 --> 24:32.840]  It's not the, more of that.
[24:32.840 --> 24:35.840]  So we were going to say earlier that you've got to label everything.
[24:35.840 --> 24:37.840]  Everything's got to be tagged by the MED.
[24:37.840 --> 24:40.840]  So I can't just grab a clone and drive over there and be like, here's a clone, you guys.
[24:40.840 --> 24:41.840]  Now you have capelton.
[24:41.840 --> 24:42.840]  Good luck.
[24:42.840 --> 24:43.840]  That'd be tight.
[24:43.840 --> 24:45.840]  Yeah, I'd bring you some 31% tested genetics.
[24:45.840 --> 24:46.840]  Oh, yeah.
[24:46.840 --> 24:47.840]  It'd be fun over there.
[24:47.840 --> 24:48.840]  Oh, yeah.
[24:48.840 --> 24:49.840]  All right.
[24:49.840 --> 24:50.840]  So what's next?
[24:50.840 --> 24:51.840]  What's the next evolution?
[24:51.840 --> 24:58.840]  If you go all full no-till, then what's the next way to improve your garden after that?
[24:58.840 --> 25:00.840]  I mean, once you're no-till, you do your thing.
[25:00.840 --> 25:02.840]  You figure out some good top dress recipes, really.
[25:02.840 --> 25:05.840]  Because, I mean, by that point, if you've got a full on no-till, like, I mean, Mountain
[25:05.840 --> 25:09.840]  Organics, everybody on Instagram really wants to see some really, I mean, this guy is where
[25:09.840 --> 25:13.840]  I discovered no-till from a couple years back before I even knew what no-till was.
[25:13.840 --> 25:15.840]  I was following this guy, Mountain Organics.
[25:15.840 --> 25:18.840]  He's got the tech down with the no-till.
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.840]  But, yeah, once you've got it going for, like, that many cycles, you know what you
[25:23.840 --> 25:24.840]  need.
[25:24.840 --> 25:27.840]  And I really don't think there's much more you can do other than just kind of, like,
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.840]  seeing if anything new comes out, you know, if a new style or something comes out.
[25:31.840 --> 25:33.840]  Just taking care of the plants.
[25:33.840 --> 25:34.840]  Yeah, exactly.
[25:34.840 --> 25:35.840]  New genetics.
[25:35.840 --> 25:36.840]  Exactly.
[25:36.840 --> 25:37.840]  Morphino hunting.
[25:37.840 --> 25:40.840]  You said that you use easy cloners at the Big Grow when we were talking before the show.
[25:40.840 --> 25:42.840]  How do you do those organically?
[25:42.840 --> 25:43.840]  Just curious.
[25:43.840 --> 25:44.840]  It's OMRIs.
[25:44.840 --> 25:45.840]  What is it?
[25:45.840 --> 25:46.840]  It's the Hormex.
[25:46.840 --> 25:47.840]  Okay.
[25:47.840 --> 25:48.840]  Yeah, Hormex and Somaro.
[25:48.840 --> 25:49.840]  Okay.
[25:49.840 --> 25:50.840]  Yeah.
[25:50.840 --> 25:51.840]  I didn't think of that.
[25:51.840 --> 25:52.840]  For the easy cloner.
[25:52.840 --> 25:59.840]  We just started using this inoculant from Mountain Organics, actually.
[25:59.840 --> 26:01.840]  That is supposed to be the truth.
[26:01.840 --> 26:02.840]  So we'll see.
[26:02.840 --> 26:04.840]  We actually just started using that last week.
[26:04.840 --> 26:05.840]  Nice.
[26:05.840 --> 26:06.840]  So, yeah.
[26:06.840 --> 26:11.840]  I was told that inside of the Clonex dipping gel that I use for my cloner, that there is
[26:12.840 --> 26:19.840]  a chemical called purple lavender dye, I think is what it is.
[26:19.840 --> 26:20.840]  Lavender.
[26:20.840 --> 26:21.840]  I think it's purple lavender dye.
[26:21.840 --> 26:25.840]  And a friend of mine was like, oh, dude, don't use that shit because he saw it on my shelf.
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.840]  And he's actually, I don't know his degree, but he's got college degrees.
[26:29.840 --> 26:31.840]  And when he saw it, he's like, no.
[26:31.840 --> 26:32.840]  He kind of freaked out on me.
[26:32.840 --> 26:33.840]  Yeah, apparently Clonex is no good.
[26:33.840 --> 26:34.840]  I used to use that too.
[26:34.840 --> 26:35.840]  Yeah.
[26:35.840 --> 26:36.840]  He told me to get rid of that shit.
[26:36.840 --> 26:37.840]  So you guys do some research.
[26:37.840 --> 26:41.840]  That purple velvet dye or purple crystalline velvet dye or something like that.
[26:41.840 --> 26:42.840]  I don't recall exactly.
[26:42.840 --> 26:46.840]  But if you Google Clonex, find the ingredients, that purple dye in there is supposed to be
[26:46.840 --> 26:47.840]  really bad for you.
[26:47.840 --> 26:51.840]  Also, there's something in there that it's really not good for you.
[26:51.840 --> 26:54.840]  If you get it on your hands and stuff, it could definitely cause you some problems.
[26:54.840 --> 26:56.840]  So go do some research on Clonex.
[26:56.840 --> 26:58.840]  That's why I was asking Will how they do it organically.
[26:58.840 --> 27:01.840]  Yeah, we do most of our, we only use the clone boxes.
[27:01.840 --> 27:02.840]  Those are like, we're trying to phase out of those.
[27:02.840 --> 27:04.840]  So we just have two of those right now.
[27:04.840 --> 27:10.840]  Most of our clones go into little root rights that we have packed into little like one by
[27:10.840 --> 27:15.840]  one cubes with some Pro-Mix and then just a little like a solution of RO, aloe, and
[27:15.840 --> 27:19.840]  then some humic acids from BioAg.
[27:19.840 --> 27:24.840]  And then we dip those in the aloe and just let those sit in the domes for two weeks.
[27:24.840 --> 27:25.840]  And we're good to go.
[27:25.840 --> 27:26.840]  They seem to love aloe.
[27:26.840 --> 27:27.840]  Everybody's on the aloe kick now.
[27:27.840 --> 27:28.840]  Nice.
[27:28.840 --> 27:29.840]  Do you use like liquid aloe or powder?
[27:29.840 --> 27:31.840]  No, we get just straight raw cold pressed aloe.
[27:31.840 --> 27:32.840]  Okay.
[27:32.840 --> 27:35.840]  So we just dip the cutting in that, put it right into the root riot.
[27:35.840 --> 27:39.840]  And with the, if you're putting it in your water, I mean, you need just a small finite
[27:39.840 --> 27:41.840]  amount of aloe goes a long, long way.
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.840]  Like for a whole 300 gallons when we're watering our plants, we use one ounce.
[27:44.840 --> 27:45.840]  Oh shit.
[27:45.840 --> 27:46.840]  Okay.
[27:46.840 --> 27:47.840]  So just one ounce.
[27:47.840 --> 27:48.840]  That's like a coffee cup basically.
[27:48.840 --> 27:49.840]  That's a shot glass.
[27:49.840 --> 27:50.840]  Oh yeah.
[27:50.840 --> 27:51.840]  Shot glass, 30 milliliters.
[27:51.840 --> 27:52.840]  30 something milliliters.
[27:52.840 --> 27:53.840]  Did I say 30 ounces or what?
[27:53.840 --> 27:54.840]  Did I say one ounce or 30 ounces?
[27:54.840 --> 27:55.840]  You said one ounce.
[27:55.840 --> 27:56.840]  I just overjudged it.
[27:56.840 --> 27:57.840]  I was thinking, yeah, I went way bigger.
[27:57.840 --> 27:58.840]  Yeah.
[27:58.840 --> 27:59.840]  Okay.
[27:59.840 --> 28:00.840]  Wow.
[28:00.840 --> 28:01.840]  Nice.
[28:01.840 --> 28:04.840]  So if you're thinking about something, uh, if you've got a recommendation, go for it.
[28:04.840 --> 28:05.840]  Build a soil.
[28:05.840 --> 28:06.840]  That's what I was going to say.
[28:06.840 --> 28:07.840]  I'm glad you said it before I did.
[28:07.840 --> 28:08.840]  They do not pay the podcast.
[28:08.840 --> 28:09.840]  They're not a sponsor.
[28:09.840 --> 28:11.840]  That's the place to go for that type of shit.
[28:11.840 --> 28:14.840]  They get powdered coconut water, uh, powdered aloe.
[28:14.840 --> 28:16.840]  Uh, just go check out buildasoil.com.
[28:16.840 --> 28:17.840]  I recommend that.
[28:17.840 --> 28:18.840]  Everything.
[28:18.840 --> 28:22.840]  If you like, don't know anything about organics and like, don't know where to go and need
[28:22.840 --> 28:25.840]  it's, but he's got everything you need on there to start doing organically from like
[28:25.840 --> 28:26.840]  buying the supplies.
[28:26.840 --> 28:32.840]  And then he also has like, uh, directions on how to clone, veg, flour, different top
[28:32.840 --> 28:33.840]  dress regimens.
[28:33.840 --> 28:34.840]  He's got everything you need to know on there.
[28:34.840 --> 28:35.840]  He's a real, real, real cool guy.
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.840]  Those guys are great.
[28:36.840 --> 28:40.840]  I haven't checked out their website in a little while, but yeah, I need to go check that out.
[28:40.840 --> 28:43.840]  It sounds like they've updated a whole bunch since I've done business with them, but yeah,
[28:43.840 --> 28:46.840]  they've got all your powdered dry organic amendments and they'll ship them to you everywhere.
[28:46.840 --> 28:47.840]  Yeah.
[28:47.840 --> 28:48.840]  They're here in Colorado, Fort Collins, I believe.
[28:48.840 --> 28:49.840]  Yeah.
[28:49.840 --> 28:50.840]  Yeah.
[28:50.840 --> 28:51.840]  The great price is very affordable.
[28:51.840 --> 28:52.840]  They're reasonable.
[28:52.840 --> 28:53.840]  The more you buy, the cheaper it gets because they're powdered in their bulk.
[28:54.840 --> 28:56.840]  They don't waste a lot of money on a lot of packaging.
[28:56.840 --> 28:58.840]  So they're actually going to make a little package up for you.
[28:58.840 --> 29:00.840]  They're going to weigh it there and their warehouse.
[29:00.840 --> 29:01.840]  They're going to ship out exactly what you order.
[29:01.840 --> 29:02.840]  Yeah.
[29:02.840 --> 29:03.840]  Great customer service.
[29:03.840 --> 29:06.840]  Uh, one time there was a weird, something weird with my order.
[29:06.840 --> 29:09.840]  I ordered like two things on the same day and wanted it to be in the same order.
[29:09.840 --> 29:12.840]  And I emailed him and like, he personally called me from like his cell phone and he
[29:12.840 --> 29:15.840]  got it worked out with me and got it all shipped out.
[29:15.840 --> 29:16.840]  No extra charge, nothing.
[29:16.840 --> 29:17.840]  That's really cool.
[29:17.840 --> 29:18.840]  Yeah.
[29:18.840 --> 29:19.840]  I love companies that do that kind of stuff.
[29:19.840 --> 29:20.840]  That was awesome.
[29:20.840 --> 29:23.840]  In the grow industry, there are a lot of companies that if they make a mistake, they go, Oh, we've
[29:23.840 --> 29:24.840]  got your money.
[29:24.840 --> 29:25.840]  Have a nice day.
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.840]  We'll either see you again or we won't because we get plenty of business from plenty of other
[29:29.840 --> 29:30.840]  people.
[29:30.840 --> 29:31.840]  Yeah.
[29:31.840 --> 29:33.840]  I wrote down a whole bunch of notes, but you wrote down a bunch of notes too.
[29:33.840 --> 29:37.840]  I want to make sure that we cover anything that you wanted to talk about.
[29:37.840 --> 29:39.840]  Oh, let's see here.
[29:42.840 --> 29:44.840]  Frosty shouted out Frosty.
[29:44.840 --> 29:45.840]  Yeah.
[29:45.840 --> 29:46.840]  Frosty is a good dude.
[29:46.840 --> 29:47.840]  I don't see that dude often enough.
[29:47.840 --> 29:48.840]  We have to make sure to give that dude a huge shout out.
[29:48.840 --> 29:50.840]  We're going to get them on the show for no till.
[29:50.840 --> 29:51.840]  Frosty, don't be nervous.
[29:51.840 --> 29:52.840]  Just come on the show, bro.
[29:52.840 --> 29:58.840]  I guess the one thing I missed here is the vortex brewers and irrigation systems that
[29:58.840 --> 29:59.840]  I learned at work.
[29:59.840 --> 30:00.840]  That stuff's pretty cool.
[30:00.840 --> 30:06.840]  If you're into brewing teas, combo season, everything, the more agitation they get, the
[30:06.840 --> 30:07.840]  better.
[30:07.840 --> 30:10.840]  It's how they brew faster and it's going to be a little stronger.
[30:10.840 --> 30:14.840]  The microbes are going to be a little more active and if they brew more irrigated.
[30:15.840 --> 30:19.840]  Just using air stones works, but the vortex brewer, it's kind of self-explanatory.
[30:19.840 --> 30:21.840]  It's a vortex that spins inside.
[30:21.840 --> 30:25.840]  There's three tubes and it spins the water at a really fast, like a vortex.
[30:25.840 --> 30:26.840]  Super fast.
[30:26.840 --> 30:27.840]  Yeah, super fast.
[30:27.840 --> 30:32.840]  You'll get a tea brewing where you'll have bubbles popping up within minutes and there's
[30:32.840 --> 30:34.840]  no extra yucca in there or anything like that.
[30:34.840 --> 30:37.840]  It's just it gets activated so quickly.
[30:37.840 --> 30:41.840]  I've actually seen guys clean out their vortex brewer and put bubble bags in there and make
[30:41.840 --> 30:42.840]  hash in it.
[30:42.840 --> 30:43.840]  Oh, that's fun.
[30:43.840 --> 30:46.840]  Because it spins so rapidly that they just, yeah, they totally make hash with it in the
[30:46.840 --> 30:47.840]  off season.
[30:47.840 --> 30:48.840]  That's funny.
[30:48.840 --> 30:51.840]  Yeah, so you harvest and clean it out, make some hash, then clean it out again and then
[30:51.840 --> 30:52.840]  put tea in it.
[30:52.840 --> 30:53.840]  That's awesome.
[30:53.840 --> 30:54.840]  And the irrigation system.
[30:54.840 --> 30:55.840]  What else were you going to talk about the irrigation system?
[30:55.840 --> 30:57.840]  Yeah, the irrigation systems are cool.
[30:57.840 --> 31:01.840]  I could never be able to run one at my house because I mean, like I said, I run a 4K.
[31:01.840 --> 31:06.840]  I have like at most 40 plants inside, but it's really cool.
[31:06.840 --> 31:10.840]  I'm sure most people know about them if they're growers, but for those of you that don't,
[31:10.840 --> 31:15.840]  irrigation system is basically a self-watering system that you put a little emitter in each
[31:15.840 --> 31:21.840]  pot or down the line of the raised bed and you turn on a motor and it just sucks all
[31:21.840 --> 31:24.840]  the water out of the tank and gives each plant the exact same amount of water.
[31:24.840 --> 31:28.840]  It cuts the watering time from like an hour and a half to about 20 minutes.
[31:28.840 --> 31:32.840]  The time it takes you to build that system saves you so much time.
[31:32.840 --> 31:35.840]  I've been telling all of the listeners that we're going to talk about building a watering
[31:35.840 --> 31:36.840]  system.
[31:36.840 --> 31:38.840]  So you just teased it again.
[31:38.840 --> 31:40.840]  I've got it halfway written.
[31:40.840 --> 31:41.840]  I've got about halfway written.
[31:41.840 --> 31:42.840]  It's kind of very specific.
[31:42.840 --> 31:43.840]  It's for your needs.
[31:43.840 --> 31:44.840]  I've got a guideline written.
[31:44.840 --> 31:45.840]  So we'll put that out pretty soon here.
[31:45.840 --> 31:46.840]  I can record that one.
[31:46.840 --> 31:47.840]  It'll take me less than an hour or so.
[31:47.840 --> 31:48.840]  I had to sit down and do that one night.
[31:48.840 --> 31:49.840]  So guys, that one's coming, how to build your own irrigation system.
[31:49.840 --> 31:50.840]  They're sweet.
[31:50.840 --> 31:51.840]  I think that if you've got eight plants or 108 plants or 800 plants, I think an irrigation
[31:51.840 --> 31:52.840]  system could be very useful for you.
[31:52.840 --> 31:53.840]  Sometimes when I'm away, I'm like, oh God, I want to just go home and check on the plants
[31:53.840 --> 31:54.840]  and see if they're dry.
[31:54.840 --> 31:55.840]  I just want to get them dry.
[31:55.840 --> 31:56.840]  I'm like, oh, I'm going to go home and check on the plants and see if they're dry.
[31:56.840 --> 32:16.840]  I just want to, I would go to Denver for shows and on the way back I would stop to
[32:16.840 --> 32:17.840]  grow and check on the plants.
[32:17.840 --> 32:18.840]  That's how OCD I was.
[32:18.840 --> 32:19.840]  Yeah.
[32:19.840 --> 32:20.840]  Cause some shit can go wrong sometimes.
[32:20.840 --> 32:21.840]  It will clog.
[32:21.840 --> 32:22.840]  Eventually your, your watering system is going to clog up.
[32:22.840 --> 32:23.840]  You're going to have to mess with it, but we'll talk about building one.
[32:24.840 --> 32:25.840]  It's very useful no matter how many plants you're running.
[32:25.840 --> 32:26.840]  It can definitely save you a bunch of time.
[32:26.840 --> 32:27.840]  Dad, that's for sure.
[32:27.840 --> 32:28.840]  Especially if you don't have a lot of room to walk in there.
[32:28.840 --> 32:29.840]  Like if you want to blow out a room, dude, I'm six foot five and in a residential girl
[32:29.840 --> 32:30.840]  lights hanging at about, I don't know, probably they're, they're about six foot down.
[32:30.840 --> 32:31.840]  So yeah.
[32:31.840 --> 32:32.840]  And walking through stuff sometimes I'd leave people like what's with the walkway.
[32:32.840 --> 32:33.840]  You're not growing cement.
[32:33.840 --> 32:34.840]  And I'm like, bro, look, it'd be as big as me.
[32:34.840 --> 32:35.840]  Like, come on.
[32:35.840 --> 32:36.840]  And then I put my dreads in a giant bun and now I'm like, so I'm going to have to walk
[32:36.840 --> 32:37.840]  in the room.
[32:37.840 --> 32:38.840]  I'm like, dude, I'm six foot five.
[32:38.840 --> 33:01.620]  I can't wear too baggy of clothes because I get hung up on everything.
[33:01.620 --> 33:02.620]  Yeah.
[33:02.620 --> 33:06.880]  I wish I could shrink up a little bit sometimes.
[33:06.880 --> 33:13.360]  to be this this gigantic look like yeah all right uh you shout it out frosty frosty we
[33:13.360 --> 33:17.600]  want to get you on the show dude let's do some no-till stuff let's do some no-till stuff

[46:48.200 --> 46:52.200]  that was kind of neat to see he's a big dude and i just watched him kind of melt a little
[46:52.200 --> 46:58.200]  bit after the first dab uh he brought over some liquid sfv some san fernando valley og
[46:58.200 --> 47:04.200]  kush turps uh and some durban poison wax i dunked a dab of what am i smoking some jack

[47:20.200 --> 47:24.200]  we were talking before the show as i was mentioning uh we're getting nice and roasted and medicated
[47:24.200 --> 47:29.200]  taking dabs off the email uh and jesse was telling me that he went to oregon and he was
[47:29.200 --> 47:33.200]  actually ballsy enough to take his medicine on the plane with him a whole bunch of it
[47:33.200 --> 47:38.200]  a whole bunch of it well tell tell everybody what you traveled on a plane with i took some
[47:38.200 --> 47:46.200]  um live res some this is gonna sound ridiculous i took live res water hash rosin uh some flower

[48:02.200 --> 48:06.200]  similar to a bomb it's already a bomb essentially yeah so they don't they don't want that on
[48:06.200 --> 48:12.200]  the plane so i took all that well the rigs were in a locked uh case so and i i put the

[49:49.200 --> 49:54.200]  commercial grow proud of you guys that's awesome to hear it's a lot of work this is
[49:54.200 --> 50:00.200]  uh basically i've had i've ran little med shop grows and now i'm in a big yeah it's
[50:00.200 --> 50:06.200]  a lot of fucking work isn't it you were saying earlier that it took you all day to cut uh
[50:06.200 --> 50:10.200]  three to four hundred clones yeah yeah people there are people that would probably they
[50:10.200 --> 50:15.200]  probably heard that they went shit man i could probably cut a thousand clones today of grade
[50:15.200 --> 50:19.200]  three you know perfectly chosen right perfectly chosen and you said that you don't keep mother
[50:19.200 --> 50:23.200]  plants that you take the clones off the veg plants you've got to run through the veg area
[50:23.200 --> 50:28.200]  with a cup or a container of water and get cuts gather them up and then go back to the
[50:28.200 --> 50:34.200]  cloning area consult back with the with the schedule i've got to look at the schedule
[50:34.200 --> 50:39.200]  of stuff that's already been harvested i got to look at the stuff that is going to be before
[50:39.200 --> 50:45.200]  it so that we have we have a specific program to harvest four strains a week out of our
[50:45.200 --> 50:51.200]  16 strains so that we always have x strain on hand and to keep in track with all that
[50:51.200 --> 50:55.200]  also is it's a lot of work man that's things that people don't think about is trying to
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.200]  keep the variety coming consistently because in a grow you're going to want to put let's
[51:00.200 --> 51:05.200]  do this whole row of sour diesel per se just because you want that whole row but then when
[51:05.200 --> 51:09.200]  it comes time to put it on the shelf now you've got a whole bunch of sour diesel so
[51:09.200 --> 51:13.200]  somebody comes to the dispensary to buy product we're going to shoot ton of sour diesel if
[51:13.200 --> 51:18.200]  that's all you're interested in and then see we're a wholesaler so that makes it even worse
[51:18.200 --> 51:24.200]  so the dispensary buyer comes to us and you know we got a whole bunch of sour diesel even
[51:24.200 --> 51:29.200]  if it's bomb you know they're probably just going to go on so that's one of the big reasons
[51:29.200 --> 51:33.200]  we have to have a everybody likes a variety you need that 31 flavors that's what keeps
[51:33.200 --> 51:36.200]  them coming back if you could probably if you could probably sell 10 pounds of that
[51:36.200 --> 51:40.200]  sour diesel but if you had five other strains you could probably sell seven pounds of each
[51:40.200 --> 51:44.200]  one of them just because of the variety yeah yeah so variety is king that's good people
[51:44.200 --> 51:48.200]  don't think about what it takes I've been talking a little bit about it on the show
[51:48.200 --> 51:51.200]  about commercial growing people don't think about what it takes it's good to hear you
[51:51.200 --> 51:55.200]  come in and talk about just scheduling the clones because it starts at the clones you
[51:55.200 --> 52:01.200]  got to schedule the clones to know what your variety is going to be in about 120 days
[52:02.200 --> 52:10.200]  yeah yeah so that's more like 90 for for my situation but you know still it's yeah it's
[52:10.200 --> 52:15.200]  planning preparation and then everything you do this is something that I got sidetracked
[52:15.200 --> 52:19.200]  on when I was talking with will everything you do has to be documented in metric pretty
[52:19.200 --> 52:24.200]  much if your scissors touch a plant you have to open up a computer and make a note somewhere
[52:24.200 --> 52:29.200]  in the damn computer that something happened we have one person spends 40 hours a week
[52:29.200 --> 52:36.200]  doing nothing but that man yeah yeah I mean that's yeah it's this MacBook on a cart which
[52:36.200 --> 52:39.200]  was actually a trash can with a piece of wood on top of it because I had a trash can on
[52:39.200 --> 52:42.200]  wheels that I pushed around to water one of the smaller areas it was like for water and
[52:42.200 --> 52:46.200]  small plants I would put a board on top of that put the MacBook on top of there and that
[52:46.200 --> 52:50.200]  was my metric station roll that around and just do my metric right there all day long
[52:50.200 --> 52:58.200]  I just made 900 clones of this just harvested this yeah if you cut off so there are very
[52:59.200 --> 53:03.200]  varying different different compliance officers will tell you different rules on this if you
[53:03.200 --> 53:08.200]  cut off something on a plant it needs to be weighed and documented in metric you have
[53:08.200 --> 53:13.200]  to go to that plant tag number you have to say I manicured point four grams off of plant
[53:13.200 --> 53:18.200]  number nine zero five five five and then you have to show on camera that you destroyed
[53:18.200 --> 53:23.200]  the part that was manicured off the plant it's very tedious and metric very tedious
[53:23.200 --> 53:27.200]  all right so we talked about dabs on a plane Jesse got away with taking a shoot on a plane
[53:27.200 --> 53:31.200]  and he looks like an ogre too and they didn't even mess with us awesome then we talked about
[53:31.200 --> 53:35.200]  your new grow space let's talk about what we brought you here for the main topic that
[53:35.200 --> 53:39.200]  you when we talked on Facebook you're like I want to talk about reminding people to clean
[53:39.200 --> 53:44.200]  up their grow space after the outdoor season for sure yeah so what do you want to tell
[53:44.200 --> 53:49.200]  us about that because that is a super good topic I mean it depends on how you grow I
[53:50.200 --> 53:57.200]  guess but you know I'm an organic grower kind of homestead style is a term a real farmer
[53:57.200 --> 54:03.200]  yeah yeah it's a term I've been using lately I picked it up from a person in Oregon so
[54:03.200 --> 54:08.200]  we should give that person a shout out did you mention the podcast to them at all no
[54:08.200 --> 54:13.200]  she didn't even have internet man yeah I'm not surprised hippie Mary she lived on the
[54:14.200 --> 54:21.200]  coast down the road from the place I was staying and it's normally not like me to go out and
[54:21.200 --> 54:27.200]  just randomly start talking to strangers but for some reason I there were some huge tomato
[54:27.200 --> 54:31.200]  plants in her yard that kind of attracted me to her so I ended up making a friend out
[54:31.200 --> 54:35.200]  there but that's the true farmer in you yeah the tomato plants the tomato plants are done
[54:35.200 --> 54:40.200]  in Colorado they've been harvested and eaten by now and she had tomatoes up there and Jesse
[54:40.200 --> 54:49.200]  was like oh yeah no that's uh I told her how she grows how I grew because she actually
[54:49.200 --> 54:55.200]  had a couple plants out back too but I told her how I grew and she called me a homestead
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.200]  farmer so or homestead grower so I kind of like that term I like that it feels good for
[55:00.200 --> 55:08.200]  sure but my situation I've got living soil I've got a whole bunch of plant waste the
[55:08.200 --> 55:13.200]  leaves the stocks all that so I've taken all of that and run it through a chipper
[55:13.200 --> 55:20.200]  into the compost pile okay so by next you know summer that will be nice black compost
[55:20.200 --> 55:25.200]  and it'll have you know all the nutrients that were still in it and this is the this
[55:25.200 --> 55:29.200]  will be the third year we've done this but it just all goes right back into the system
[55:29.200 --> 55:37.200]  again that's awesome so I mulched up my soil real good I watered it down real good and
[55:37.200 --> 55:43.200]  I've got it covered with plastic to store it over the winter is that gonna make a nice
[55:43.200 --> 55:47.200]  mycelium layer happen in there you're gonna get some funk okay and that's a good thing
[55:47.200 --> 55:51.200]  you guys when you start seeing a lot of people see that white fuzz they'll make some super
[55:51.200 --> 55:54.200]  soil or they'll make some compost yeah and they see that white fuzz and they freak out
[55:54.200 --> 56:00.200]  that's what you're working for that's the goal that white fuzz is magic yes sir that's
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.200]  what's gonna make all the shit happen all right so you got your compost pile covered
[56:05.200 --> 56:13.200]  yeah we got all that handled the plastic is good for several things it helps insulate
[56:13.200 --> 56:20.200]  the soil on really cold days I mean on really cold days it's it's gonna get cold there's
[56:20.200 --> 56:24.200]  nothing you can do about that but on days when it warms up and then it cools off again
[56:24.200 --> 56:31.200]  it can the warmer the soil stays the more breakdown happens the more healthy bioactive
[56:32.200 --> 56:38.200]  it is alive yeah so it protects it from that it protects it from getting blown away drying
[56:38.200 --> 56:44.200]  out and blowing you know all the precious topsoil off and then also something I've noticed
[56:44.200 --> 56:50.200]  last year is it keeps the damn neighborhood cats from yeah neighborhood cats love to piss
[56:50.200 --> 56:57.200]  and do their thing in your in your nice fresh garden soil so it keeps them away too perfect
[56:58.200 --> 57:03.200]  yes cats probably helps keeps birds out it's possibly Oh birds wouldn't be so bad but yeah
[57:03.200 --> 57:10.200]  but yeah so chicken shit into there oh yeah well that goes into the compost pile okay
[57:10.200 --> 57:15.200]  so it just all returns back to the do you use a Bokashi bucket at home yes you pour
[57:15.200 --> 57:20.200]  that Bokashi bucket right into there do you have another use for it normally I put it
[57:20.200 --> 57:26.200]  in the compost pile or I'll just bury it directly in one of the beds okay nice but
[57:26.200 --> 57:31.200]  here lately I'm gonna go ahead and compost it inside after it's done in the bucket I'll
[57:31.200 --> 57:39.200]  put it in a little miniature tumbler I made and that'll be to reduce or make it less acidic
[57:39.200 --> 57:45.200]  okay and then I'm gonna feed it to my new warm inside warm bins so awesome yeah you
[57:45.200 --> 57:50.200]  and Spencer both doing worms barefoot stew and worms everyone's going worm life it's
[57:50.200 --> 57:54.200]  awesome I love it it's good to see everybody doing worms have you tried to use the stuff
[57:54.200 --> 57:59.200]  from your Bokashi bucket the drainage that they call it the leachate that stinky foot
[57:59.200 --> 58:03.200]  smell and juice that comes out of there if you have a clogged drain or that shit right
[58:03.200 --> 58:08.200]  down the drain like probably two ounces down a clogged drain it'll dissolve if you got
[58:08.200 --> 58:12.200]  like a hair clog or whatever is in there it'll I've got these dreadlocks down to my fucking
[58:12.200 --> 58:16.200]  knees so I get some hair clogs in the drain the shower just pour that in there it'll clean
[58:16.200 --> 58:20.200]  it right up it'll stink you gotta pour it in there let it soak all through I give it
[58:20.200 --> 58:23.200]  like an hour and then just go run the hot water kind of push it down and get rid of
[58:23.200 --> 58:28.200]  the smell but it eats it right up nice yeah I remember you told me you cleaned a clone
[58:28.200 --> 58:31.200]  machine with it once too yeah put that in the corner and let it run it eats up all the
[58:31.200 --> 58:36.200]  basically dissolves all the that funky layer that the cloner gets it's covered in calcium
[58:36.200 --> 58:40.200]  and stuff yeah you guys take good care of your cloners I had a cloner since I didn't
[58:40.200 --> 58:44.200]  clean it out good enough it got clogged up and fried itself so my fault whoops yep yep
[58:44.200 --> 58:49.200]  all right we're talking about compost piles sorry I totally said try to side track you
[58:49.200 --> 58:55.200]  another thing on that on the Bokashi liquid that is basically I've been told this from
[58:55.200 --> 59:04.200]  two people that really know their stuff that is basically EM1 yes so it's like great white
[59:04.200 --> 59:11.200]  shark essentially yeah I've been using EM1 all summer and I have been getting it from
[59:11.200 --> 59:15.200]  a friend I've been making it myself and I'm out so for the last couple weeks I've just
[59:15.200 --> 59:22.200]  been using Bokashi bucket juice when I normally would use the EM1 and I see no noticeable
[59:22.200 --> 59:28.200]  changes good or bad nice yeah that's yeah other than the the rotting trash can decaying
[59:28.200 --> 59:35.200]  that's such great stuff smells like a bar dumpster yeah that's that has food to somebody
[59:35.200 --> 59:42.200]  threw up in yeah all right so you're composting all of your stocks all of your big leaves
[59:42.200 --> 59:46.200]  that aren't usable for any product yeah that's all going into the compost pile the chicken
[59:46.200 --> 59:51.200]  shits in there nitrogen all your food waste that you've been eating all the time goes
[59:51.200 --> 59:55.200]  into your Bokashi bucket so you're making fertilizer out of that that gets buried we've
[59:55.200 --> 01:00:00.200]  got our soil covered up got the soil covered up you can actually read if you're you know
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:06.200]  I'm not necessarily no till where I'm at so you can go ahead and actually reamend now
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:11.200]  and put all your amendments you would put in in the spring and it just makes everything
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:15.200]  better how much of that old root ball do I need to get out of there before I do that
[01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:18.200]  I leave all of it in you leave all you just chop the stick and then kind of dig another
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:25.200]  hole later yeah if you keep the soil wet and active throughout the winter in this and
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:30.200]  the early spring there will be no root ball when you come back to it if you let it dry
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:34.200]  out and you don't cover it the root ball will still very much be there okay okay keep it
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:40.200]  moist and the earth will eat it yeah reassimilate it turn it back into food okay all right so
[01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:46.200]  you can reamend now in the winter and that stuff will hopefully re-colonize and keep
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.200]  producing itself right then you'll have even more potent soil by the time it's time to
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:54.200]  go outdoors okay so and then at that point the only things I would add in would just
[01:00:54.200 --> 01:01:02.200]  be like kelp and alfalfa things that are they're gonna break down all the way through to where
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:09.200]  you know there's basically none left for it so you know go ahead and I really stumbled
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:15.200]  all over that's all right go ahead when you plant go ahead and do like a mycorrhiza inoculant
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:21.200]  and then add a little kelp and this is when you're planting yeah okay and a little alfalfa
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:26.200]  to the soil okay ready to roll nice we can talk more about that later shows yeah we're
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:30.200]  definitely gonna record a whole bunch of outdoor episodes for next year so that we've got them
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:35.200]  prepared yeah we were both so busy this year yeah these big commercial grows keep us on
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.200]  our feet my summer next year is looking to be even busier so how do you already know
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:47.200]  that well because it's only a few months away that is true so yeah that's after November
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:52.200]  well we'll know if it's gonna happen or not so we're just waiting till then but we have
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:59.200]  a nap and this is a whole nother outfit we we have an outline we have property they have
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:03.200]  licensing everything like that so excellent waiting to pull the trigger everything you
[01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:07.200]  everything you seem to get involved in seems to take off and go to get a good launch so
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.200]  yeah I'm sure it's gonna work for you I've been uh yeah I stumble into all these startups
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:16.200]  it's kind of weird because you're a guy that can get shit done and people need somebody
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:21.200]  like you they can get shit done true and the grocery store doesn't hurt either and I know
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:26.200]  how to grow and I know how I know how to do things but I don't know as much on how to
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:31.200]  get shit done as you do so I need a guy like you to fucking build the walls and build the
[01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:34.200]  tables and then once you get the tables built then I can come in and build the watering
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:38.200]  system and run the plants for sure that's why you're on the move and I'm on the move
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.200]  yeah and then we run it a few times they decide we need to remodel and rebuild and so call
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.200]  Jesse back I'll take a few months off to go somewhere else and Jesse come rebuild and
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.200]  I'll come back and regrow and we'll just keep playing dance around you build shit I'll grow
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.200]  go grow up places nice yeah you're a man on the move maybe we'll get you growing outdoors
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.200]  this summer oh that sounds awesome we can't do it here I mean my backyard fences oh no
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:05.200]  no I'm talking like 3,500 plants let's do it I mean let's go get a sunburn game okay
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.200]  and then I'll buy no for long enough hey we'll work in the shade of the plants there we go
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.200]  yeah I grow them tall enough where I can be shaded under them that's rad I'm so in I'm
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.200]  so in so you guys Jesse mentioned he said we will wait till this November to decide
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.200]  if that's gonna happen there's an election coming up we may get a president that doesn't
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.200]  want medical cannabis or recreational cannabis at all that may might put a kibosh on some
[01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:34.200]  of our plans but more locally what Jesse is talking about we have amendment 200 and amendment
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:40.200]  300 here in Pueblo Colorado if those pass the marijuana industry in Pueblo Colorado
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:46.200]  will be forced to shut down in the year 2017 they get a full year to keep going but after
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:52.200]  that it's over and so no new licenses so like these people even though they have a license
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:04:00.200]  they've never grown before so and and it's kind of a change of location for him too so
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.200]  they wouldn't under the new proposal they wouldn't be able to let it happen yeah good
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.200]  luck I hope everything yes it's probably gonna be too late by the time this episode comes
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:14.200]  out I hope you voted please I want to give a huge shout out to Mike to white Mike fuck

[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:07.200]  because we expected winter to come I covered up my swamp cooler so that it would because
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:10.200]  it was cold in the night the air was coming in there and freezing me when I was trying
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.200]  to watch Narcos that's an excellent show man I hate the way it ended I was like no be more
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.200]  oh no there will be yeah there's yeah they're gonna do a Cali cartel which isn't nearly
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:24.200]  as exciting but right it'll still be pretty good I just did I wasn't I had an attachment
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:30.200]  to that show oh yeah 20 episodes was not enough I love anything drug smuggling culture I just
[01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:38.200]  eat it up I've read a few books I've watched every documentary I mean yeah the dude the
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:45.200]  big Lebowski will be at a the chronic con coming up pretty soon so you can go meet him

[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:55.200]  yeah yeah all right so let's get a little bit back I don't think we finished up talking
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:06:00.200]  about cleaning the garden so we've got it topped or kind of reamended for next year
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.200]  we filled it with some kelp and some alfalfa meal and then when it comes time for season
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:10.200]  we're gonna dig a little hole and we're gonna put some mycorrhizae in there some more kelp
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:15.200]  some more alfalfa maybe some crab meal yeah yeah maybe some worm castings oh yeah okay
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.200]  or just worms themselves worms themselves yeah you guys get the worms going the worms
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:24.200]  are so good for the environment if you've got the compost pile you know by all means
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:28.200]  use it up put that yeah put that in there put that in your holes so that that sounds
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.200]  so gross put that in the holes where you're planting your plants so that all that compost
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:36.200]  that rich compost can feed those plants even if you're sorry to cut you off no go for it
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.200]  even if you're grown in pots you can still utilize that that compost even if you're using
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.200]  salt based chemical nutrients you can still utilize that compost yes I love the trend
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:51.200]  that I'm seeing on Instagram and social media and even the forums of people they're recycling
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:56.200]  soil and running no-till and you're seeing them top dress and decorate their plants to
[01:06:56.200 --> 01:07:00.200]  keep like a layer in there to where they can keep the moisture in and they're putting
[01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:04.200]  stuff like alfalfa sprouts and other sprouts on top of there and I'm loving the way that
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:08.200]  it looks in a nice indoor garden with these this other growth on top of your plant you
[01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:12.200]  get a little little ecosphere on top of your plant there sure and then you got a pot plant
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:16.200]  growing out of it and that little shit that's growing out of it is dying and actually feeding
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:20.200]  your plant it's such a it's such a neat little thing to learn and see happen it's like a
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:25.200]  miniature environment yeah it's that permaculture is that the word I'm looking for no there'd
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:34.200]  be no till which is a permaculture value but permaculture is hard to wrangle into one
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:40.200]  set you know one definition okay it's just a way of looking at things so learn something
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:44.200]  today all right so we've got our plants so now we're still at the end of the season let's
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:47.200]  keep ourselves kind of on track we're at the end of the season we've cleaned up we've got
[01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.200]  our compost pile everything's chipped up everything's covered we put some stuff where the old plants
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:58.200]  were now what should we focus on other than that cleaning up your trash you know inevitable
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:04.200]  every grows got a little bit you know whether it's beer bottles or you know old netting
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:10.200]  dr. pepper bottles yeah you know it's zigzag wrappers yeah get get all that shit cleaned
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:16.200]  up it looks bad get your cages put away if you use those if you're netting or whatever
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:22.200]  get that all put up any kind of shade cloth if you want to reuse it next year you need
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:27.200]  to store it away and get it out of the weather same with like your water barrels your air
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:32.200]  pumps any kind of liquid nutrients you had outside you need to get all that inside and
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.200]  in a warm place you know and don't bring it inside to your grow area yeah don't do that
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:42.200]  don't bring the bugs and mildew into your garden put it in the shed outside clean it
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:46.200]  clean it if you can take some time and clean it just polish it up if you had a fan or something
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:51.200]  outside yeah take it apart clean it please clean it with some h2o to or some of that
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.200]  I think it's the same thing but the 30% hydrogen peroxide clean it with some of that clean
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:09:02.200]  everything wearing gloves you guys or even like enzymes complete or higher Zymer's or
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.200]  some of the Bokashi juice yeah yeah yeah just clean your stuff up be creative you know use
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:13.200]  what's at your disposal dr. Bonner soap I mean some of that was like was like some
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:19.200]  pine oil and or something like that and it wouldn't that's gonna kill anything so yeah
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.200]  yeah I like the dr. Bronner's yeah I love that shit wash my dreads with it you can wash
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.200]  everything with it yeah it's perfect all right so clean up get out there and clean everything
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:31.200]  up take all the equipment out of there make it look like there was never a grow there
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:38.200]  yeah okay if you're if you grow in pots and you want to reuse all your soil even if you're
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.200]  not if you grow in pots and you're not reusing your soil throw it away like you know it's
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:49.200]  just if you had any issues they're still lingering there you know if you are going to reuse it
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.200]  get it all in a pile get it wet cover it with plastic it's the same principle we were talking
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:01.200]  about with covering the with the raised beds and everything so you know if we had some
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.200]  fungus gnats or powdery mildew is that going to be kind of destroyed in the composting
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:12.200]  process or is that going to compound fungus gnats if you get it heated if you get the
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.200]  pile heated up enough which means you've got to add a considerable amount of raw green
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.200]  material and just organic matter to it for it to heat back up it will most definitely
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:28.200]  kill the fungus gnats. Okay. Powdery mildew I have no idea. Okay. Now we might we might
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:32.200]  be killing ourselves trying to do both because I think if you put the green in there the
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:36.200]  PM will grow on the green but I don't think the PM can grow on things that are not leafy
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:41.200]  for sure well I mean green matter could even be or like green manure I mean it could be
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:47.200]  cow shit it could be anything that's going to heat up grass clippings if you feel safe
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:53.200]  old pot leaves yeah so I mean chicken poop yeah oh yeah chicken chicken poop is just
[01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:57.200]  such a great amendment and I know it's funny that I say that because I'm a vegetarian and
[01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:01.200]  I don't even eat the chickens but I've noticed that when chicken poop goes into a compost
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:05.200]  goes into plants that really does something and then seabird poop also yeah any sort of
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:11.200]  seabird poop anything from the sea is really really rich I love the way sea stuff grows
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:16.200]  yeah that's that's why that California Kush smells so good. Sea Gannix if I ever had to
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:21.200]  label the way I like to grow you know that's Sea Gannix. Do you want me to edit that out
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.200]  so nobody steals that because that's that might be a phrase you want to. No because
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:29.200]  there may be someone on the coast that's like way more worthy of using that I'm not worried
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.200]  about it. Alright guys some grower on the coast that wants to make some sea based. But
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:38.200]  you better be getting like your own kelp and your own bird shit. Yeah go out to the ocean
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.200]  and get some buckets. Impress me. That's probably illegal as fuck don't do that. You
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:46.200]  did not hear that here on the podcast. Oh man there's kelp laying all over the beach
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:50.200]  in Oregon. You're probably going to get in trouble if you collect it. I don't think so.
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:54.200]  It's Oregon. It stinks. Okay. Yeah I'm pretty sure people wouldn't mind. Get it put it in
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:59.200]  some bottles and ship the first tester batches to Jesse. We'd love to try it. Rinse all the
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:07.200]  salt off first please. Yeah please. I can just see the plants just. What did you do
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:12.200]  to me? Oh yeah I forgot to rinse the kelp. Oops. We are way off topic but we are still
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:17.200]  on topic. It's amazing how we do it. This is something I deal with every year and I
[01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:24.200]  fucking did it this year. Clean out your outdoor spray bottles because like mine have teas
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.200]  go through it which has a lot of molasses and they always clog up. Oh yeah. And then
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.200]  in the spring I'm just like motherfucker and end up throwing it away and going and getting
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.200]  a new one. You pump it and you go to spray it and it goes. I cleaned them all out with
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.200]  super hot water this year and good to go for next year. You guys buy the pump sprayers
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.200]  that have the nozzle on it where you can release the pressure. You want to be able to release
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:49.200]  that pressure because otherwise you'll pump it up real hard and the nozzle will get stuck.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.200]  You'll never get it off of there. And now you can't refill it and you got to just throw
[01:12:53.200 --> 01:12:56.200]  it away. Because you'll try to pop it open with something and you're just going to break
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:00.200]  it. Some of the plastic somewhere will spin. Trust me. Get the ones with the type that
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:04.200]  have the pressure release valve so you can once it's pumped up and pressurized you can
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:09.200]  take that pressure off. It's really scary trying to undo it when you got like neem oil
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:14.200]  in there and you don't want it to spray up in your face. I saw that happen with someone
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:19.200]  that had a tank full of formite once. Like a backpack tank. They're pumping it and pumping
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:25.200]  it and they didn't have the lid screwed on all the way right. Yeah. That was back before
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:31.200]  anyone, well lots of people knew better but we didn't. Yeah. Back before we knew that
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:35.200]  formite was a no go. You guys if you got to do something, if you get a brand new clone
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:39.200]  and it came from somebody and you really really want it but it might have something hidden
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:44.200]  if you need to. But mother that out and take clones from that. Don't go smoking the formited
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:48.200]  one. At least try to get a generation from there. Alright so we've cleaned up everything
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:53.200]  we've got. We want to cover up the holes for the area for next year or do you just want
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:57.200]  to leave it exposed? You want that covered up. Okay cover that up so that all the stuff
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.200]  can process in there. Get some heat in there. You got your compost pile going. You got everything
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.200]  cleaned up. It doesn't even look like a grow happened in that yard or that field anymore
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:09.200]  right? Yeah. Just make it look nice and good. Yeah and it's all, it's a clean slate for
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:12.200]  you to go back next year. And then as soon as the snow melts and you're thinking about
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:16.200]  growing, the next thing to do is go out there and fix all of the holes in your fences and
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.200]  go check that fence. Go make sure that that thing is super secure. Go pick up all of the
[01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:24.200]  dog shit. I'm sure your dog or one of your buddies dogs have been out there dropping
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:28.200]  deuces. Go pick that up. You don't want all the flies coming around because of dog poop
[01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:34.200]  out there. As soon as it gets warm, that's the stuff you got to do. And then I mean depending
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:39.200]  on how serious you get, I actually, I know of a couple of people that are already growing
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:47.200]  their plants for next season. But you know if you're a small, you know 25-35 plant or
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:53.200]  less outdoor grow, you can get away with, you know, you can start your plants in February
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.200]  probably. If you're growing from seed and you want to do a phenoselection, I suggest
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:04.200]  starting now. But if you're growing from clones, you know, February you can start, you know,
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:09.200]  start them up if you're going for trees. So. Start them up, get them huge. Don't let them
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:14.200]  get root bound. Ever, ever, ever. Yeah, because they will start to flower on you. They will
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.200]  start flowering. So, veg them inside, get them big, top them, get them loved. Don't
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:22.200]  let them get root bound. Keep them pest free. Don't run, yeah, keep them pest free. Do not
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.200]  run them on a 24-hour light unless you plan on putting them outside underneath a 24-hour
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:32.200]  light. See, I would have never thought of that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean if you got a hoop
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:36.200]  house and you can run a little, all it takes is like just a little fluorescent. Right.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:42.200]  If you can do that, sure, go for 24. But in my experience running them 24 and then putting
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:49.200]  them outside under not 24 is, it just, it either stunts them out, sativas, it will throw
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:56.200]  them into bloom. Or I mean, indica's it'll throw them into bloom. So just. And then you
[01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.200]  get two weeks of going into bloom and then going back into veg and then vegging and then
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:04.200]  going back into flower. And then you got plants that just look like hell and they're mad.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:08.200]  And you have a very funky looking plant at the end of the season. Yeah. And your trimmers
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:14.200]  hate you. Maybe some seeds. Yeah, probably. Maybe some seeds, man. Is there anything else
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:17.200]  that we should mention when it comes to cleaning up your garden at the end of the season to
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:24.200]  prepare for the winter and the next year? Um, nothing major. If you have locks on gates
[01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:29.200]  or something like that, uh, put them inside unless they need to be out there, but it just
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.200]  keeps them from at least around here. It keeps them from getting arrested up and crap like
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.200]  that. So just a lot of the things I do is so that I don't have to spend money on it
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:43.200]  the next year. And so that my tools last all summer, you know, first several years, not
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:48.200]  just one season at a time. So I think a lot of that comes with age or getting older for
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:54.200]  sure. We're getting tired of buying the same damn hammer. Where did I put that? I left
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:59.200]  it out somewhere. Yeah. Now you get that shit and put it away, especially around here. Cause
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.200]  if you leave it somewhere, it's fucking gone. Yeah. You don't get a chance. Yeah. It could
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:09.200]  be, they'll almost take the shit out of your hand if you blink long enough. Sorry, I did
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:14.200]  need to bash this town, but fuck dude, drugs are bad. I'm okay. Yeah. Drugs are real bad.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.200]  And the town North of us has the other drug. We got the drug that makes you go real slow
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.200]  and sleepy. And then up North, they got the ones that are making you go real fast. So
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:24.200]  it's just fucking ridiculous all over the place lately. Everyone's fucking flipping
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:29.200]  out. Oh man. That looks like such a good idea. You guys, Jesse's taking a big fat dab of
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.200]  some Durban poison. Oh, you hear that? Yeah. Shout out to pass rock in the email. There
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:39.200]  you go. Cough it up. He has, it sounds like it's my turn to take a dab. Um, Jesse, do
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:42.200]  you have any final words for the podcast you want to put out to the listeners before we
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:50.200]  wrap it up? Um, shout out to one love garden supply. Come check us out. Denver or, um,
[01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:56.200]  boulders, Pueblo. Um, it just took a big dab and then I put them on the spot. My fault.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:18:00.200]  My fault. A shout out to the awesome people in Oregon. Oh, that's something I meant to
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:06.200]  tell you. Customer service out there is ridiculous. They are so nice. Really? It's yeah. They
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.200]  don't seem like they're mad at you for wanting a sandwich at the sandwich place. No, not
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:13.200]  at all. They're actually glad to see you. That's pretty rad. Even in super small little
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:19.200]  Podunk towns like is the, every time we had a great customer service experience out there,
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.200]  I would think of your rants on Facebook about how horrible. And I'm like, you know, he's
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:27.200]  fucking right. Yeah. When you go somewhere that actually they're like, Hey, welcome to
[01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.200]  our establishment where you're going to pay our wages. Can we help you properly? Like,
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:35.200]  Oh shit. They know about service here. Awesome. I'm glad you got taken well care of. Shout
[01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:40.200]  out to all the nice people on the coast for sure. Awesome. Awesome experience. That's
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.200]  rad. Shout out to your wife for, uh, for letting you go on that adventure and for also hooking
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.200]  me up every time I go to the growth store, she takes really good care of me. I can send
[01:18:48.200 --> 01:18:51.200]  her a Facebook message and let her know what I need. And when I get there, it's on the
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:55.200]  damn counter waiting for me. She makes life very easy. So shout out to burn. I appreciate

[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:02.680]  one from Alaskan pure organics. Let me turn on the music just a little bit here. This
[01:31:03.680 --> 01:31:07.680]  iTunes review comes from our friend Alaskan pure organics and it says it was left on September
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:12.680]  15th. It says I listened to every show informative and great guests. It's become my favorite
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:17.680]  show about cannabis. That's an honor. Uh, there are some other great podcasts out there
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:21.680]  about cannabis, so I appreciate hearing that I'm your favorite. Big thanks for the email
[01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:26.680]  and huge thanks for the five star rating. I appreciate it. All right. Our next review
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:31.680]  comes from a listener who calls themselves Akatsuki leader and they left the review on
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:35.680]  October 1st. They gave me of course a five star review and it goes like this. Rusty Jeff,
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:40.680]  keep up the fantastic work. I just listened to your podcast. Oh, I started listening to
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:44.680]  your podcast sometime about four to five months ago and the information, humor and love that
[01:31:44.680 --> 01:31:49.680]  you put into this podcast is unparalleled. I look forward to many more episodes brother.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.680]  Well, I'm going to put out a whole bunch more episodes, so stick around. I'm glad you appreciate
[01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:56.680]  it. Uh, man, thanks for listening. You've been around for four or five months, probably
[01:31:56.680 --> 01:32:00.680]  a close to six months now, right? Since it's been a month since you left this review. Thanks
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:04.680]  for hanging out. Thanks for listening. Uh, anybody else that would like to leave a review,
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.680]  please do so. Like I said, just go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search for the girl
[01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:12.680]  from your heart podcast, find the review section, type in a little comment and let me know what
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.680]  you think about the show and I will read your review on a future episode. Once again, big
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:22.680]  shout out to Akatsuki leader and Alaskan pure organics. I do appreciate the reviews. All
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.680]  right, so the next thing on my agenda, ladies and gentlemen, I want to read some emails
[01:32:26.680 --> 01:32:30.680]  from a few listeners and I'm searching for that email now. There we go. All right, this
[01:32:30.680 --> 01:32:33.680]  listener, I don't know if this person wants me to say their name, so I'm going to skip
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:38.680]  that, but it says Rasta Jeff, your podcast is so much fun. You were really entertaining.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:43.680]  Truly so much fun to listen to. Uh, truly so much fun to listen to you host. Your growing
[01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:48.680]  lessons are on point. Hearing you listen to, uh, hearing you listen to JRE. I knew right
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:52.680]  away this podcast was going to be awesome. I'm going to fucks with I read genetics forever.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:56.680]  I'm growing legal cannabis for myself in SoCal and I want to know how I can listen
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:33:01.680]  to your first 50 episodes. Other than that, I really wanted to give thanks for what you're
[01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:06.680]  doing. And then they signed their name. Uh, I appreciate you for the email. I appreciate
[01:33:06.680 --> 01:33:10.680]  you for listening. Yes, I am a huge, they said JRE that's Joe Rogan experience. I'm
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:14.680]  a huge Joe Rogan experience fan. Uh, I never skip an episode. I listened to almost every
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:19.680]  episode as soon as it comes out. That's probably my favorite podcast, uh, followed by the church
[01:33:19.680 --> 01:33:24.680]  of what's happening now with uncle Joey. To be honest with you, uh, Doug loves movies
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:29.680]  with Doug Benson is probably my favorite podcast. So those are my top three. Uh, let's see.
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:32.680]  You also say my grow lessons are on point. Thank you. Um, I spend a lot of time trying
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:36.680]  to create grow lessons that are useful for you guys. That's why I like it when the listeners
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.680]  send me emails. I like creating content that is generated from questions from listeners.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.680]  So I'm glad you appreciate the grow lessons. I'm glad you find them to be on point. Uh,
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.680]  you're going to fuck with I read genetics forever. That is awesome. I hope you've got
[01:33:48.680 --> 01:33:51.680]  some, I read genetics in your garden. If not, we need to figure out how to make that
[01:33:51.680 --> 01:33:56.680]  happen for you. Uh, you're growing legally in SoCal, so that's rad. Uh, we definitely
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:33:58.680]  need to get some, I read genetics in your hands. I want to know what you're growing
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:34:01.680]  out there. And I also want to know what part of SoCal you're in because that's where I'm
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.680]  from. I actually grew up in bellflower, California. I went to bellflower high school for middle
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:10.680]  school and then I moved to Colorado in the middle of ninth grade. So I'm from SoCal.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:14.680]  Also a lot of people call me out and like, what part of California are you from? And
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:17.680]  I'm like, what are you even talking about? They say that the clothes I wear and the way
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.680]  that I am, they can tell I'm from California and called out a few times. So then you also
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:27.680]  say you want to listen to the first 50 episodes. Uh, most of the feeds apparently don't have
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:31.680]  the first 50 episodes cause I'm all the way up to 160. This is going to be one 64. So
[01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:36.680]  it looks like the last 64 episodes are getting bumped out of the feed. What I've been talking
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:39.680]  about doing is going and finding those old episodes. They're in my computer. They're
[01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:43.680]  on my, uh, my drive over there. I just need to plug that in and find the old episodes.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:48.680]  They're probably on my web server still. I just repost them. And then I don't know
[01:34:48.680 --> 01:34:51.680]  if I want to like go back and edit them at all and be like, Hey, what's up? This is a
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:55.680]  repost or if I just want to repost it and put it in the feed as a bonus episode. But
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:59.680]  that's probably the best way to do it. If you really want them a super bad, send me
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:03.680]  an email. If you guys are like dying to hear the first 64 episodes or something, send me
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:07.680]  an email. Maybe we can work out a way where I can send you the files through WeTransfer
[01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:11.680]  or Dropbox or something. We'll get it going. But I may just throw in the first episode,
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:15.680]  the first 50 episodes back in the feed, like every five or six episodes or something. Just
[01:35:15.680 --> 01:35:19.680]  put another one in there so that you guys can go listen to the old stuff. And that'll
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:22.680]  also be a fun exercise in seeing how much we've progressed because you'll be able to
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:26.680]  spot the old episodes right away. So I may have to put the old episodes back in the feed.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:30.680]  And maybe if you send me an email and you ask really nicely for a few episodes, I can't
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:33.680]  send you all 50 at once. That's going to blow up my computer. But if you ask me for a few
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:37.680]  episodes at a time, maybe I can send you a few at a time. Maybe put me, maybe we can
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.680]  make a list or something, a few people, and then I could just dump all the episodes to
[01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.680]  a few people, like five at a time or something, five a week, something like that. I'd love
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.680]  to help you out though. We'll get it going for you. Email me back if you want them as
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:51.680]  a file. Anybody that's listening, if you want the first 50, we can figure something out.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:55.680]  Send me an email. Let me see how many people are interested. We'll figure something. All
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:59.680]  right. Thanks for the email. I appreciate it. Let's get on to the next email. This one
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.680]  is from a very frequent listener, somebody that I interact with on Twitter, somebody
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:07.680]  that's been a longtime listener. I truly appreciate you for hanging out so long with
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:11.680]  us. This one, I could probably say your name because you use your Instagram and Twitter
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:17.680]  handle. This is our friend FastBerry. FastBerry says, hello, Jeff. Thanks for the podcast.
[01:36:17.680 --> 01:36:22.680]  I enjoy hearing your curing episodes. Your drying and curing method is almost exactly
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.680]  the way I do it. So word. Nice. It's good to know that people out there are doing the
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:30.680]  things that I'm doing. It's good to know that other people have the same ideas that I do
[01:36:30.680 --> 01:36:34.680]  and we're working with the same methods. A little affirmation is always a good thing.
[01:36:34.680 --> 01:36:38.680]  You also say, I would add that I trim dry my plants on a piece of parchment paper so
[01:36:38.680 --> 01:36:44.680]  I can collect the resin heads off that fall later when I clean up. That's a really good
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:48.680]  idea. You guys, when you're about to trim your buds, put down, what did he say that
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:52.680]  he added? Some parchment paper. Put down a sheet of parchment paper over the table and
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:56.680]  then trim onto the parchment paper. And then when you're done, you can clean up all the
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.680]  keef that came off of there. You're going to have a bunch of resin heads on there and
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:03.680]  then you can either put those in a bowl and smoke them or if you're really into it, you
[01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:07.680]  can press them if you know how to make rosin. So that's something that's useful. That's
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:12.680]  a good idea. Thanks for the heads up on that one, FastBerry. He also continues, he says,
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:18.680]  I have a full time job, so no time for excessive burping of jars. But I do put the lids on
[01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:23.680]  upside down, metal to glass and loosely screw on the cap. So you guys, instead of sealing
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.680]  the cap the normal way where it's got the waxy seal against the glass and then you put
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.680]  the lid on real tight, he flips it upside down and puts the metal to glass on there.
[01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:37.680]  So it's not making a super tight seal. And then he only screws it on medium tight, apparently.
[01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:41.680]  Loosely screws on the cap. He says it allows some air exchange, but it prevents buds from
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:48.680]  drying out. I do that for 48 hours. Then I start the 12 hour check, burp, and we'll repeat
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:52.680]  as needed. Then daily, then weekly, blah, blah, blah. And he said, you know, you just
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:58.680]  did the episode. Thanks, FastBerry on Instagram and Twitter. You guys, if you go follow my
[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.680]  friend FastBerry on Instagram and or Twitter, make sure you let him know that you heard
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:06.680]  his email on the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Shout out FastBerry. It's good to know that
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:09.680]  other people are doing that. And you guys, that's a great update and a great addition
[01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:15.680]  to what I said. If you have a full time job, if you can't dedicate 24 hours a day to your
[01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:19.680]  grow, which is understandable. I'm not calling you out. Most people have a normal job and
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:23.680]  they grow in their spare time. If this is you and you can't check those jars, if you've
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:30.680]  got to go to work, I, for a long time, for like a year, I lived 55 miles away from where
[01:38:30.680 --> 01:38:34.680]  I work. So it would take me one hour to get to work. Then I would be at work for 8 to
[01:38:34.680 --> 01:38:38.680]  12 hours, maybe 14 hours on some days. Then there's another drive home. And then you got
[01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.680]  to do whatever you do when you get home. You got to eat, you got to poop, you got to shower,
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:46.680]  you got to put on clothes for the next day. You got to get all that shit going. So of
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:50.680]  course it limited me to maybe four or five hours of time that I was able to work on my
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:54.680]  garden at home. So I totally understand that. A lot of people are in that situation. You
[01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:59.680]  guys can put your buds in these jars and you can leave the lids on upside down and loose
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:02.680]  and you'll get some airflow in there and you'll still slowly dry the buds. Because that's
[01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:09.680]  your main objective is to slowly and evenly dry these buds. All right. FastBerry, I appreciate
[01:39:09.680 --> 01:39:13.680]  the email. You guys keep the emails coming. That is super helpful. I've got one more email
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:19.680]  that is actually a correction. I said something in an episode about THCA converting to THC,
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:25.680]  but guess what? I was wrong. I said that shit backwards. So let me read an email. He says
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:29.680]  his name in the email. I'm going to skip it. He says, Hey brother, my name is Beep and
[01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.680]  I've been listening to your podcast since I heard an episode on Tok Radio earlier on
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:37.680]  in the year. Big shout out to our friends at Tok Radio. Big shout out to Citizen J.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:42.680]  Of course you can listen to our podcast Wednesdays. I don't know the correct day. Wednesdays at
[01:39:42.680 --> 01:39:46.680]  noon? I think it's Wednesday at noon on tokradio.com. I will correct that by the end of this episode.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:50.680]  I will make sure I've got the right time and date. There's a lot of shit in my head right
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:54.680]  now. Anyway, he listens to me on Tok Radio. I appreciate that. He said, I'm a huge fan
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:58.680]  of the podcast, your grow techniques, your advice, and your Irie Rasta way of life. I'm
[01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:02.680]  an aspiring cannabis enthusiast myself and I'm working on getting my foot in the door
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:06.680]  of the cannabis industry here in Connecticut. For the past few years, I've been learning
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:11.680]  as much about cannabis as I can before I enter either the medical or recreational side of
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:16.680]  the industry when we establish a rec site that is. And I have to thank you, your friends
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:22.680]  and your podcast for supplying me with a massive amount of cannabis information and grow tips.
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:26.680]  Dude, that's a huge compliment. I hope that our podcast has put you on the right path
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:29.680]  to where when you're able to get into a facility, you could be a leader. Maybe you could be
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:35.680]  one of the bosses, the cultivation directors. Maybe since it's new, maybe you can just invent
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.680]  the phrase, you're like, I'm cultivation director. Tell them so and do that. So I hope we can
[01:40:38.680 --> 01:40:43.680]  get you your foot in the door when the time comes. Connecticut, huh? I don't think I've
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:48.680]  ever been to Connecticut. I've been to a lot of places and I cannot remember ever going
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:53.680]  to Connecticut for any reason. I don't think, no, no. Fish would be the only thing that
[01:40:53.680 --> 01:40:57.680]  would take me that direction. And I've never seen fish in Connecticut. So I remember that.
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.680]  Let's see. I'm going to continue with the email. He says on a separate note and the
[01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:05.680]  episode you put out this morning, you asked to correct you if you got the THC THC a conversion
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.680]  wrong. From what I remember, the THC is what the trichomes start off as and they transform
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:17.680]  into THC when heating through decarboxylation through curing most likely increases the psychoactive
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:24.680]  potency of the trichome since THC decarboxylates. Sorry, I got to spin the page. Since the THC
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:29.680]  decarboxylates, where am I now? In the form of water vapor. Let me know if that was a
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.680]  solid knowledge, man. I'm not a scientist. I hope the rest of your day is iry, brother.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:39.680]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me. Dude, you're totally correct. What you
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:43.680]  said is completely correct. So thanks for the correction. Guys, don't be afraid to correct
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.680]  me if I say something stupid on the podcast. If I say something wrong, please send me an
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.680]  email and let me know that I done fucked up because it's the only way that I can correct
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:55.680]  it and I don't want to teach people the wrong way. That's a big part of why I started this
[01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.680]  podcast, you guys. I would be on the forums, I'd be on the internet, I'd be in Facebook
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.680]  groups and then I would see people give the shittiest advice. People would be like, I'm
[01:42:03.680 --> 01:42:06.680]  in week five in flower and I've got spider mites, what do I do? And somebody would be
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:11.680]  like, go in there and spray fluoramide. And I would just cringe. I just now slapped myself
[01:42:11.680 --> 01:42:14.680]  in the face when I read that. I was like, oh shit. I just did the Macaulay Culkin like,
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:20.680]  no. So that's part of what inspired me to do this podcast was trying not to pass along
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:27.680]  fake information and try to give useful information from experience because I'm kind of a crazy
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.680]  grower. If I have an idea and I think that something might improve my crop, the only
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.680]  way to find out if it's going to improve it is to do it. And I figure I've been growing
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:39.680]  long enough to where I've got a good foundation. You know what I'm saying? I can skateboard.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:42.680]  I cannot skateboard. This is an analogy. I can skateboard real well. It's time to hit
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.680]  the half pipe. So sometimes I'll go in the grow room and do half pipe tricks. I'll be
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:50.680]  like, what if I just totally do this? And occasionally I fuck up and kill plants, you
[01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:54.680]  guys, but that's all part of learning and experimenting. All right. I'm way sidetracked.
[01:42:54.680 --> 01:42:58.680]  I'm way off my topic, but if I do something wrong, if I say something wrong, please do
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:02.680]  correct me. Jesse corrected me a couple of times. Actually, Jesse's dad told Jesse to
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:06.680]  come and correct me. So shout out to Jay and Jesse. Shout out to anybody else who's ever
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:10.680]  sent me a correction. Don't be afraid. I like being corrected. It makes me a better podcaster.
[01:43:10.680 --> 01:43:14.680]  It makes me a better grower and it makes me a better teacher and it humbles me. So help
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:16.680]  me God. I can't do that. All right, you guys. I want to appreciate. I want to appreciate.
[01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:19.680]  I already do appreciate you. I want to thank everybody who sent me an email. I want to
[01:43:19.680 --> 01:43:23.680]  thank everybody who sent me an iTunes comment. I do have a shit ton more emails. You guys,
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.680]  I'm not ignoring the emails, the Facebook messages, the Instagram messages that I've
[01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:31.680]  got. There are so many of them, but I picked a few for this episode. I'll do a few more
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:35.680]  in the next couple of episodes. All right. I feel like I'm talking really fast. You guys,
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:39.680]  I could probably use a drink of water and of course I need a big fat dab. So I'm just
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.680]  going to press pause. I'm going to medicate myself. I'm going to hydrate myself and I'll
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.680]  be back in just a couple of seconds.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:53.550]  All right, podcast world. I am back. I just took a couple of fat dabs of some Jack Flash
[01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:58.550]  shatter from our friends at TR Concentrates. Super shattery. It's kind of like the, I said
[01:43:58.550 --> 01:44:03.550]  this before on a previous episode, it's kind of like the consistency of a Jolly Rancher.
[01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:06.550]  If you tried to break Jolly Ranchers with your fingers, it would just go popping and
[01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:11.550]  flying everywhere. It's kind of that hard consistency, that hard texture, but it tastes
[01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:15.550]  really good and obviously it gets me really rambly high because I've been freaking talking
[01:44:15.550 --> 01:44:19.550]  a million miles an hour in this episode. I want to thank you guys for listening to my
[01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:23.550]  rambles. So I promised you guys some grow tips and grow tricks, but before I get that
[01:44:23.550 --> 01:44:28.550]  far, I want to talk about my most recent breeding project. Of course, if you listen to the podcast,
[01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:34.550]  you know I made some Arise F2s. I also crossed Arise F1 to Lemon Skunk. All of those seeds
[01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:39.550]  have been harvested. They've all been dried out properly. They're all in jars. Our friend
[01:44:39.550 --> 01:44:43.550]  Jesse was given a few of those the last time he was here. Barefoot Grower was given a few
[01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:47.550]  of those when he was here for the podcast. So some of those have gone out. I'm working
[01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:52.550]  some of the new seeds into my grow schedule so that I can grow some of those. I really
[01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:57.550]  want to know what the Arise F2 does, but I really want to know what that Arise to Lemon
[01:44:57.550 --> 01:45:01.550]  Skunk is going to do for me because everything I've crossed my Lemon Skunk female, everything
[01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:07.550]  has been amazing. I also did Arise to Grateful Dog. I'm super curious about that. That one
[01:45:07.550 --> 01:45:11.550]  will probably not be released for a while. I want to play with that one for a little
[01:45:11.550 --> 01:45:14.550]  bit by myself, and then I'll put it out in seed form. I have to make more of it. I only
[01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:18.550]  have a small handful of seeds of that one. The others, I have a lot of seeds, so they'll
[01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:22.550]  go out. So my new breeding project, ladies and gentlemen, let me talk more about that.
[01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:27.550]  I am using the same Arise male. I've got an Arise male. He is a stud. If you follow me
[01:45:27.550 --> 01:45:31.550]  on Instagram, you have seen this dude on Instagram. He grows, for a male plant, he grows some of
[01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:36.550]  the biggest colas, the biggest male flowers I've ever seen. He puts resin out. He smells
[01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:42.550]  terrible. He's got this really funky stank to him, which is a good thing for a male.
[01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:49.550]  Arise is Golden Goat was the female, and Daybreaker from Gage Green Genetics was the male. Daybreaker
[01:45:49.550 --> 01:45:56.550]  is Chem D and Joseph OG. So those are the ones that the Joseph OG, Chem D crossed to
[01:45:56.550 --> 01:46:00.550]  Golden Goat, which is Island Sweet Skunk, Hawaiian Sativa, and Romulan. So it's such
[01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:08.550]  a good combo. Arise is a great strain. I took the male, and now the males are in flower.
[01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:12.550]  This podcast won't go out for quite some time, but the males are now in flower. They went
[01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:19.550]  into flower yesterday. I've got two huts with other plants in them, two five-by-five huts
[01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:24.550]  with two-gallon pots, and the huts are crammed pretty tight. There's two-gallon pots, stuff
[01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:29.550]  in those huts, and there are Cookies and Cream females, Cookies and Cream females, White
[01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:35.550]  Widow females, there's Lemon Skunk females, there's a Lemon Jeffrey in there. There are
[01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:38.550]  a couple others in there that I don't even need to mention yet, but we'll talk about
[01:46:38.550 --> 01:46:44.550]  those later in the future. Those are probably going to go into flower maybe Monday, but
[01:46:44.550 --> 01:46:48.550]  anyway, pretty soon. Those are going to go into flower here. I need the male to get ahead
[01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:51.550]  just a little tiny bit, but I don't want my girls to get too big, and they're starting
[01:46:51.550 --> 01:46:55.550]  to kind of get tall. So I need to time this out just right, but I'm going to keep the
[01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:59.550]  males separate. I'm going to let him flower out. There are two male plants. It's the same
[01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:03.550]  strain, but I just need enough pollen to do two huts. So I've got two male plants in there.
[01:47:03.550 --> 01:47:07.550]  They're flowering. I'm going to keep them separate to keep that pollen in there, and
[01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:12.550]  then around day 25-ish, depending on how the plants look, I'm going to go and pollinate
[01:47:12.550 --> 01:47:17.550]  25 of flower for the girls. I'm going to go in and pollinate both of the five-by-five
[01:47:17.550 --> 01:47:20.550]  huts worth of plants, and then we'll make a bunch of new crosses. So that's what's going
[01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:25.550]  on in my breeding projects. I like to keep you guys updated. Some of you guys really
[01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:28.550]  care. Some of you guys probably don't care at all. So let's move on to some grow tips
[01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:34.550]  like I talked about. You guys, I've been talking about growing in cocoa coir a whole bunch.
[01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:38.550]  I've experimented with several brands of cocoa. I've experimented with different nutrient
[01:47:38.550 --> 01:47:43.550]  feeds in cocoa. I do love cocoa. I love the cocoa, but one thing that sucks is if you
[01:47:43.550 --> 01:47:48.550]  don't mix something in with it, it kind of compresses a little bit. It kind of gets to
[01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:53.550]  be too much around your roots. I feel like the plants that I did in all cocoa could have
[01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:58.550]  harvested better had I mixed something into that soil. I don't like the cocoa that I used.
[01:47:58.550 --> 01:48:02.550]  I think the plants probably could have been a little bit better. So if you're going to
[01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:09.550]  grow in cocoa, mix in maybe 50% soil or maybe mix in a whole bunch of perlite because I've
[01:48:09.550 --> 01:48:14.550]  used a couple of brands of cocoa, and some of them compress a whole bunch. Some of them
[01:48:15.550 --> 01:48:18.550]  don't. It's hard to tell when they're in the bag. I'm not going to call out brands. I've
[01:48:18.550 --> 01:48:24.550]  just learned that I want to mix my cocoa with some soil and or some perlite. That's something
[01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:28.550]  I would recommend. My babies, my clones hated going into cocoa. They just died. They were
[01:48:28.550 --> 01:48:31.550]  like, no, fuck you. That's too much pressure on the roots. There's no air in here. I'm
[01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:36.550]  going to die. So I mixed some 50-50 with soil and threw it in there. They grew, but they
[01:48:36.550 --> 01:48:43.550]  weren't happy. Then I put some just into straight soil, a soilless mix that I make for babies.
[01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:48.550]  They had no cocoa in it, and those plants took off. So start your babies in some soil
[01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:52.550]  maybe, unless you get them really going. Unless you're coming from Rockwool, then it might
[01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:55.550]  work. I'm coming out of the Easy Cloner, of course. This is what happened from the Easy
[01:48:55.550 --> 01:49:02.550]  Cloner. So I think soil or a 50-50 mix is better than just straight up cocoa. So that's
[01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:06.550]  something I wanted to mention to you guys through experience. Let's see. One of our
[01:49:06.550 --> 01:49:10.550]  friends that listens to the podcast was posting on Facebook that he's got a strain that takes
[01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:14.550]  a really long time to flower, and it's way late into flower already, and it does not
[01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:19.550]  show any signs of slowing down and being done. He was just asking questions. He wanted to
[01:49:19.550 --> 01:49:24.550]  know, WTF, he's like, what the fuck is going on with this plant, dude? So my guidance,
[01:49:24.550 --> 01:49:29.550]  my advice was to reduce the lights on that plant to speed up the flowering cycle. That
[01:49:29.550 --> 01:49:34.550]  plant is waiting for a signal to say, hey, are you done yet? Just waiting for something
[01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:39.550]  to hint at it that the season is over. Wherever that plant, it's hard to even guess where
[01:49:39.550 --> 01:49:43.550]  that plant came from. I don't know what strain you're working with, but that plant comes
[01:49:43.550 --> 01:49:50.550]  from an area where the day and night cycle between the winter and summer seasons does
[01:49:50.550 --> 01:49:57.550]  not vary very much. So when it takes to make those plants flower, they're very sensitive.
[01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:00.550]  They'll flower very easily. Sometimes those plants, those type of plants, if they get
[01:50:00.550 --> 01:50:04.550]  root bound, they'll flower. If they get crowded and they're not getting enough light, they'll
[01:50:05.550 --> 01:50:09.550]  flower. So they're cool because they'll start flowering very easily when you're ready. If
[01:50:09.550 --> 01:50:12.550]  you put them in the flower room, you'll notice sometimes those will show flower earliest,
[01:50:12.550 --> 01:50:16.550]  but also they don't want to finish. So since the season doesn't change, let me get back
[01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:20.550]  on track here. My mind is racing today. Since the season doesn't change very much, those
[01:50:20.550 --> 01:50:23.550]  plants can pretty much just go on until they wither up and die is what would happen in
[01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:27.550]  nature. And that's what they want to do. They're going to keep going until they receive pollen.
[01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:30.550]  They're just like, hey, pollinate me, pollinate me, please, please, please. And they're just
[01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:33.550]  going to grow until they fry themselves out. So you've got to reduce the lights to give
[01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:38.550]  them a hint that, oh, shit, grow season's over. I better finish up. And that's what
[01:50:38.550 --> 01:50:42.550]  you got to do. Turn the light, if you're on 12-12, turn the lights down to maybe just
[01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:47.550]  give them 10 hours of light a day instead of 12. Go 10-14. And just do that for two
[01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:51.550]  weeks and I'm sure they'll start finishing up. They may be finished up in two weeks from
[01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:55.550]  doing that. So maybe start flushing, reduce the lights. That's something that will certainly
[01:50:55.550 --> 01:50:59.550]  help you with a strain that is taking way too long. I had a Durban poison strain that
[01:50:59.550 --> 01:51:03.550]  took like 16 weeks to flower properly. When I started chopping down the lights a little
[01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:08.550]  bit, it certainly sped up the time. It cut off two full weeks if I did it, two weeks
[01:51:08.550 --> 01:51:12.550]  if I timed it properly. That grow was a long time ago. I don't even fuck with that Durban
[01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:16.550]  poison anymore. It was kind of a mess. No need for that shit in my garden. You may have
[01:51:16.550 --> 01:51:21.550]  a good Durban poison cut. No offense to yours, but the one I had, no, I did not want to work
[01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:27.550]  with that again. All right. So another thing, everybody got, not everybody, a lot of people
[01:51:27.550 --> 01:51:33.550]  got powdery mildew last winter and the winter is coming and I don't want you to get powdery
[01:51:33.550 --> 01:51:37.550]  mildew again. So let's talk about some ways that you can prevent powdery mildew that's
[01:51:37.550 --> 01:51:41.550]  going to, that possibly happens because it's winter time, you guys. When it gets cold outside
[01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:45.550]  and it stays warm inside, so you're growing cannabis indoors, right? A lot of you are
[01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:50.550]  in a basement. A lot of you are in a warehouse. You've probably got one concrete wall somewhere
[01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:54.550]  that your plants are really close to. The outside of that wall is going to get temperatures
[01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:59.550]  that are really ridiculously low. Then on the opposite side of that wall, you got a
[01:51:59.550 --> 01:52:04.550]  beautiful grow environment. So when that moisture builds up on the outside and makes that weird
[01:52:04.550 --> 01:52:08.550]  cold wall and then the heat hits it, a lot of, a lot of grow rooms, I see it happen.
[01:52:08.550 --> 01:52:12.550]  It's happened to me the first time I moved into this one house that I grew in this one
[01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:15.550]  basement that had a concrete wall, the plant, we've talked about it before, that plant in
[01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:20.550]  that corner where the concrete corner was, it got completely powdery mildew all up that
[01:52:20.550 --> 01:52:24.550]  one side. I was at another facility that had a garage door type of thing. And right
[01:52:24.550 --> 01:52:29.550]  there in that area, those plants started getting powdery mildew on the first snowfall. So something
[01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:33.550]  you can do, something you're going to need to think about is how to heat those areas
[01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:38.550]  properly. Maybe build a separate wall. I know this sounds extreme, but if you've got a wall,
[01:52:38.550 --> 01:52:43.550]  if your grow facility has a wall that is on the exterior of the building and it is concrete
[01:52:43.550 --> 01:52:47.550]  or it is not well insulated, you may want to build a six inch gap in there and put some
[01:52:47.550 --> 01:52:51.550]  insulation in there so that when it snows, you've got a buffer zone so that you're not
[01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:55.550]  freezing your plants. Something else you can do to help prevent powdery mildew, and this
[01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:59.550]  is just for all seasons, when the plants start going into flower and getting a little bit
[01:52:59.550 --> 01:53:05.550]  of chunky buds, I like to go in and take off most of the big fan leaves. Most of those
[01:53:05.550 --> 01:53:08.550]  water leaves, the sun leaves, whatever you want to call them, I like to pull the majority
[01:53:08.550 --> 01:53:13.550]  of those off. Some people think that I'm crazy. Some people think I'm nuts for doing it, but
[01:53:13.550 --> 01:53:18.550]  go in there about week three of flower and take off all those petioles and watch them
[01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:22.550]  grow back. You'll freak out because they come back. Your plants will be way more productive.
[01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:26.550]  You'll see production. What you're doing is you're letting the light penetrate a little
[01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:30.550]  bit more. You can get light down to the bottom buds to where you don't have to lollipop as
[01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:35.550]  high, and you're also creating more airspace. At the same time, you're removing places for
[01:53:35.550 --> 01:53:40.550]  powdery mildew to land and build up. A lot of times what happens, you guys, in a warm,
[01:53:40.550 --> 01:53:45.550]  humid grow room, you've got one leaf and another leaf resting right on top of each
[01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:50.550]  other. Now imagine if you're on the bus and the dude next to you just rests his fucking
[01:53:50.550 --> 01:53:54.550]  hand right on yours on the bus in the middle of the summer, and his hand is sweating and
[01:53:54.550 --> 01:53:59.550]  your hand is sweating, and you got to ride all day, 12 hours. You got fans going on in
[01:53:59.550 --> 01:54:03.550]  there, but there's this area sometimes where the fans don't hit every single leaf. You
[01:54:03.550 --> 01:54:08.550]  got to ride in there for 12 hours with the lights on you. Imagine how sticky and funky
[01:54:08.550 --> 01:54:14.550]  your hand is going to be after 12 hours of that shit. The top leaf is sweating from on
[01:54:14.550 --> 01:54:17.550]  the bottom because all that leaf pressed against it. The bottom leaf is sweating from the top
[01:54:17.550 --> 01:54:21.550]  because all that leaf against it, and you're just creating funk inside of there. Powdery
[01:54:21.550 --> 01:54:26.550]  mildew will pop up from that. If you pull off all these extra leaves, you eliminate
[01:54:26.550 --> 01:54:30.550]  the opportunity for that powdery mildew to develop under your leaves. That's something
[01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:34.550]  that's really helpful, I think. Also, there's less places for bugs. If you go in there and
[01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:39.550]  you pull off all the leaves, that's way less opportunity for bugs to hide. The bugs prefer
[01:54:39.550 --> 01:54:42.550]  those leaves with longer petioles that stick out a little bit further. They like to go
[01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:45.550]  right underneath those real big ass leaves and hang out. It's the first place you're
[01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:50.550]  going to see bug damages on the low, larger leaves, I think, most of the time. Eliminate
[01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:54.550]  that shit. Get rid of it. Don't even give the bugs an opportunity to get there. Also,
[01:54:54.550 --> 01:54:59.550]  clean up the bottoms of your plants, you guys. Nothing should touch the pot or the floor
[01:54:59.550 --> 01:55:03.550]  or the dirt. None of the stuff that's hanging off the bottom of your plant should really
[01:55:03.550 --> 01:55:06.550]  touch that. Clean that up. If you can get in there with some scissors at the early
[01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:10.550]  start of flower, just clean it up. You want, depending on the size of pot and size of plant
[01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:16.550]  you're using, I usually have at least six to eight inches between the pot and the first
[01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:20.550]  two stalks that come off my branch. I will clean that up. Sometimes if I'm going to a
[01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:24.550]  larger pot and growing larger plants, I'll clean a foot. Sometimes at Green and Healthy,
[01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:28.550]  when I had the large warehouse, we would over-veg for too long. Then we would just trellis
[01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:32.550]  everything out. Then stuff that didn't reach, I would just chop off all the branches that
[01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:37.550]  didn't reach to the trellis. We'd have a foot and a half of just naked shaved legs.
[01:55:37.550 --> 01:55:42.550]  Sometimes two feet of just naked bear shaved legs. That promotes better airflow. Again,
[01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:46.550]  it gives you less opportunity for bugs to get in there, less places for powdery mildew.
[01:55:46.550 --> 01:55:51.550]  We're not trying to grow leaves. We're trying to grow buds. Get in there about week three.
[01:55:51.550 --> 01:55:57.550]  Take off most of your fan leaves, if not all of them. I like to leave the two on the top
[01:55:57.550 --> 01:56:01.550]  of the bud. You got that top cola. I like to leave two or four leaves up there. Then
[01:56:01.550 --> 01:56:05.550]  you can grab some light, create some energy. But that lower stuff, just go mad. I take
[01:56:05.550 --> 01:56:09.550]  most of that lower shit right off. I don't even think about it. Then I get in there about
[01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:13.550]  week five and do it again. I'll feed it a bloom booster. I will feed it a root pack
[01:56:13.550 --> 01:56:18.550]  and a foliar pack to make it explode. Excuse the throat clearing, you guys. Shout out to
[01:56:18.550 --> 01:56:23.550]  TR Concentrates with their Jack Flash Hash. Huge fat dabs made me a little choked up.
[01:56:23.550 --> 01:56:27.550]  But I like to get in there and take off the leaves, feed it a root pack, feed it a foliar
[01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:31.550]  pack, feed it a strong bloom booster about week five, week six, and then go in there
[01:56:31.550 --> 01:56:36.550]  and pull off the leaves. You'll really notice it bulk up. That's my opinion. Indica strains
[01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:40.550]  really like it. Flo, blueberry, that type of stuff really appreciates it. Some of the
[01:56:40.550 --> 01:56:45.550]  sativa dominant strains don't go super heavy, but still get in there and take off some leaves.
[01:56:45.550 --> 01:56:50.550]  All right. That's what I think about defoliation. Also, Jesse and I did an episode and we talked
[01:56:50.550 --> 01:56:55.550]  about cleaning up your outdoor garden. Clean up your indoor garden, you guys. Get a broom
[01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:59.550]  and sweep up. Just why not sweep up at the end of the day? You've got to be there. Spend
[01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:03.550]  an extra five or 10 minutes and sweep up that place. Pick up all the little litter that
[01:57:03.550 --> 01:57:07.550]  lands in the grow room. Maybe there's a zip tie that you use for something that you cut
[01:57:07.550 --> 01:57:10.550]  down. Clean that shit up. There's no need to leave extra stuff sitting around. Put all
[01:57:10.550 --> 01:57:14.550]  your tools away. Put all your equipment away. Clean out your sprayers. Clean out your pumps.
[01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:18.550]  Clean out anything that can be cleaned so that it's ready for you the next time you need
[01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:22.550]  to use it. Just take a couple minutes at the end of the day and clean shit up. If you're
[01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:26.550]  growing at home, you guys, have dedicated stuff. Have a dedicated broom. Have a dedicated
[01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:32.550]  dustpan for your grow rooms. Try to have a dedicated trash can. When you clean up, when
[01:57:32.550 --> 01:57:36.550]  you sweep up, if you've got dead leaves on the floor, if you find that you've got some
[01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:39.550]  dead bugs on the floor, sometimes you'll find randomly just there'll be a little pile of
[01:57:39.550 --> 01:57:43.550]  dead whiteflies or fungus gnats or something. Maybe you sprayed and then a few days later
[01:57:43.550 --> 01:57:46.550]  all these bugs died and they just all landed over there by that fan. When you clean that
[01:57:46.550 --> 01:57:50.550]  stuff up, sweep it all up into a trash can and take that trash can out of the grow room.
[01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:54.550]  Don't leave it in the grow. If you've got dead leaves in there, don't leave those in
[01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:58.550]  the grow either. You don't want that stuff in there. Every dead leave and piece of stuff
[01:57:58.550 --> 01:58:03.550]  on the floor is another place for a bug to hide. I said this to somebody the other day.
[01:58:03.550 --> 01:58:06.550]  I said, if you've got five spider mites hiding underneath one leaf, two of them are going
[01:58:06.550 --> 01:58:09.550]  to hook up. Two of them are going to fuck. They're going to make a million spider mite
[01:58:09.550 --> 01:58:14.550]  babies. If you do the math on that, because it's just going to keep going. I'm right.
[01:58:14.550 --> 01:58:18.550]  If you've got five people at a party, by the end of the night two people are hooking up.
[01:58:18.550 --> 01:58:22.550]  That's how these spider mites are going to be. If you leave one leaf and you've got five
[01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:26.550]  spider mites under there, in five days you're going to have that multiplied by whatever
[01:58:26.550 --> 01:58:29.550]  spider mites breed out, which is a ridiculous rate. Clean up that one leaf. Just pick it
[01:58:29.550 --> 01:58:33.550]  up. There's no need for all that shit around there. Get out the shop vac and clean up the
[01:58:33.550 --> 01:58:37.550]  corners. Dust the tops of the lights. Go in. You will be amazed at how many bugs are in
[01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:41.550]  the crevices in your Govita lights. If you've got a large commercial facility and you get
[01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:45.550]  up top and you clean out your lights, there's a bunch of bugs up there. Clean all that shit
[01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:49.550]  out. It's nasty. You don't want to have that in there. Also clean your fans while you're at it.
[01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:53.550]  All right. You guys have been rambling on for a long time. I feel like that's enough info, enough
[01:58:53.550 --> 01:58:57.550]  tips, and a bunch of email talking for one episode. I want to thank everybody for listening to
[01:58:57.550 --> 01:59:01.550]  an episode of just me rambling by myself. I'm still working on the episode I promised you
[01:59:01.550 --> 01:59:05.550]  about pest prevention, management, identification, and eradication. I'm writing
[01:59:05.550 --> 01:59:09.550]  how to take care of a whole bunch of bugs, a whole bunch of different situations. It's going to be a
[01:59:09.550 --> 01:59:13.550]  multi-show piece. I'm trying to write out at least two full episodes before I get it started.
[01:59:13.550 --> 01:59:17.550]  I like to get ahead of myself. Speaking of episodes I've got written out and I'm getting ahead of myself
[01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:21.550]  with, I've got a debate about organics versus... I don't know if it's a debate,
[01:59:21.550 --> 01:59:25.550]  but whatever. The pros and cons of organics versus synthetics. I've got a lot of other great stuff
[01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:29.550]  coming up for you. I hope you guys stay tuned to future episodes. Once again, thank you guys
[01:59:29.550 --> 01:59:33.550]  for listening. I want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel. That's right.
[01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:37.550]  Much love, much respect. The community working for the community.
[01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:41.550]  They're like the FUBU of the ganja community. Yeah, I said that out loud. All right.
[01:59:41.550 --> 01:59:44.990]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you guys for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[01:59:44.990 --> 01:59:49.230]  podcast. I want to give a huge shout out to Maddie and Spence. Until next time, take a fat dab
[01:59:49.230 --> 01:59:51.550]  and give your mom a hug for me.

[02:04:01.870 --> 02:04:05.870]  if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:09.870]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:04:09.870 --> 02:04:15.870]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends, Kwame, Ross, and Jeff.
[02:04:15.870 --> 02:04:19.870]  Thank you guys again for joining me. As always, I want to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends
[02:04:19.870 --> 02:04:23.870]  in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:27.870]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:31.870]  That music was loud. Wow, sorry about that, Mike. I didn't mean to blotch your ears.
[02:04:31.870 --> 02:04:34.870]  Oh, we're good, man. Nice, nice. Welcome to the show again, bro.
[02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:38.870]  Thanks for having me back. Ladies and gentlemen, once again, joining us on the show is our good buddy,
[02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:42.870]  White Mike. Oh, I said good buddy again. Damn, I'm trying not to do that.
[02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:45.870]  I just feel so cheesy saying good buddy, my good buddy.
[02:04:45.870 --> 02:04:48.870]  It's one of those rhythms. I catch myself doing similar stuff.
[02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:51.870]  It's appropriate. You're my good buddy. Yep. Yeah. 10-4, good buddy.
[02:04:51.870 --> 02:04:55.870]  Awesome. Well, Mike's here, guys. Ladies and gentlemen, while we're doing the intro,
[02:04:55.870 --> 02:05:02.870]  remind everybody how they can follow you on social media and also tell them about your useful and successful
[02:05:02.870 --> 02:05:11.870]  cannabis Facebook page. You can catch me at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter or Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws on Facebook.
[02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:15.870]  Stalk him, you guys. Support him. Check him out. Check it out. Yeah. See what he's doing online.
[02:05:15.870 --> 02:05:18.870]  He sends me a lot of cool articles that you'll be able to see if you check out his Twitter.
[02:05:18.870 --> 02:05:22.870]  Thanks for joining me on the show. Happy to, man. Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to do a,
[02:05:22.870 --> 02:05:27.870]  this is the post-election recap. We're going to talk about what won and what did not win and what went our favor
[02:05:27.870 --> 02:05:31.870]  and what may and may not change and how things went. But before we get that far,
[02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:35.870]  we've got a few things we want to chatter about. Let's see. Where should I start?
[02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:40.870]  People like to hear about my breeding updates. You guys remember I was talking about I had a,
[02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:45.870]  an Arise F1 male and I had pollinated a bunch of stuff and they had gone for a long time.
[02:05:45.870 --> 02:05:49.870]  Those have since been harvested. Those are all harvested. All the seeds are taken out.
[02:05:49.870 --> 02:05:55.870]  The bud material is in a container getting ready to be turned into hash and the seeds are all in separate containers.
[02:05:55.870 --> 02:06:01.870]  They're being distributed to friends of mine for test growth. I am growing a large number of them myself.
[02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:07.870]  I'm pretty excited about that. I see some sprouts going and it makes me smile to see some stuff sprouting again.
[02:06:07.870 --> 02:06:11.870]  Yeah. So those are being tested. But since those are done, I cleaned up everything.
[02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:15.870]  I sprayed everything down with hot water and a little bit of bleach and I cleaned up real well
[02:06:15.870 --> 02:06:19.870]  and I got all the pollen out of the room and I'm at it again. I have got some stuff in flower.
[02:06:19.870 --> 02:06:24.870]  It is about, I would say it's by the time this comes out, it'll be three weeks into flower.
[02:06:24.870 --> 02:06:30.870]  Nice. There I am putting the Arise male to girls. It's a cookies and cream female.
[02:06:30.870 --> 02:06:34.870]  And that cookies and cream, it was one of the most resinous plants I've ever grown.
[02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:41.870]  It produced more. I remember. It was some frosty shit, but it just made little pinky sized buds all the way up the stick.
[02:06:41.870 --> 02:06:46.870]  And I could not figure out how to make it produce better. So I'm thinking if I hit it with pollen from the Arise,
[02:06:46.870 --> 02:06:51.870]  maybe that big ass Arise cola is going to fix my problem with the cookies and cream.
[02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:54.870]  We can hope. And it's going to improve that. Yeah. So that's what I'm hoping for.
[02:06:54.870 --> 02:06:58.870]  I also put a bunch of white widow in the room to get bred to.
[02:06:58.870 --> 02:07:02.870]  There's a grateful dog to get pollinated. There's a lemon Jeffrey to get pollinated.
[02:07:02.870 --> 02:07:08.870]  So here they won't get pollinated for I'm trying to predict the future right now at this time.
[02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:13.870]  They're about 10 days into flower. Hopefully that will get pollinated for another 16 days ish.
[02:07:13.870 --> 02:07:17.870]  And then about 50 days from there, the seeds should be ready.
[02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:25.870]  So then I have to harvest dry and remove the seeds and then I'll have more stuff to give out to my friends to be tested.
[02:07:25.870 --> 02:07:31.870]  And the cycle begins again. It keeps on going. And then we find out what's the best, what's worth making a whole bunch more of.
[02:07:31.870 --> 02:07:34.870]  And I'll continue those lines of things that aren't super impressive.
[02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:40.870]  Since space is limited, time is limited, resources are limited. I just try to make the best of the best.
[02:07:40.870 --> 02:07:43.870]  So we don't have to go calling things in the future. So that's where I am with breeding.
[02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:46.870]  I'll keep you guys updated as it gets further along. We're only a few days in.
[02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:51.870]  So there's not a lot of stuff to talk about. The male plants are a little bit ahead because I like their,
[02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:55.870]  I like their male flowers to develop a little bit further so they can start dropping a lot of pollen.
[02:07:55.870 --> 02:07:58.870]  So that when the girls are ready, I got plenty of pollen for all those plants.
[02:07:58.870 --> 02:08:01.870]  That's pretty much where we are. I'll keep you guys updated.
[02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:04.870]  Speaking of a breeding program, thedankteam.com.
[02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:10.870]  If you guys want to know where to get these seeds that have been tested, that are viable, that are reliable, thedankteam.com.
[02:08:10.870 --> 02:08:15.870]  They're ready to go. They're Rasta Jeff approved. Make sure you check out thedankteam.com.
[02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:21.870]  They have got archive seeds there. I'm pretty sure. They've got, who else they have?
[02:08:21.870 --> 02:08:25.870]  They've got Gage Green Genetics, Mile High. They have got Sin City Seeds.
[02:08:25.870 --> 02:08:28.870]  They've got Irie Genetic Seeds. There are a whole bunch of great brands there.
[02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:31.870]  I can't think of them off the top of my head because Mike and I took a bunch of fat dabs.
[02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:34.870]  It's an impressive list and we took an impressive list of dabs as well.
[02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:38.870]  Yes. We may be a little bit medicated. A nice variety of dabs.
[02:08:38.870 --> 02:08:41.870]  It was a nice selection tonight. Yeah.
[02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:45.870]  Good work. Let's see. Where was I? The Dank Team Ed.
[02:08:45.870 --> 02:08:49.870]  You guys, I've been putting out episodes on Thursdays.
[02:08:49.870 --> 02:08:53.870]  Thursday episodes. Woo-hoo. Thursday bonus episodes. Gotta love them.
[02:08:53.870 --> 02:08:56.870]  I've had a little more time. I've had a little more content available. I've had more friends.
[02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:59.870]  And I've noticed that sometimes episodes are kind of time sensitive.
[02:08:59.870 --> 02:09:02.870]  Like this one we want to get out probably the Monday after the election.
[02:09:02.870 --> 02:09:06.870]  Not the Thursday because I want everyone to catch this Monday episode is what I think is going to happen.
[02:09:06.870 --> 02:09:08.870]  It's going to be the Monday episode.
[02:09:08.870 --> 02:09:11.870]  Yeah. There's no reason to put this one out in three weeks.
[02:09:11.870 --> 02:09:13.870]  Yeah, exactly. We'll get it out Monday.
[02:09:13.870 --> 02:09:18.870]  So you guys that have religiously or regularly listened to the Monday episodes,
[02:09:18.870 --> 02:09:21.870]  don't forget that I've been putting stuff out on Thursdays occasionally.
[02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:24.870]  So go back and check your feet. You might have missed something if you're not paying attention.
[02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:30.870]  And also thank you for everybody that listens to just the Monday episodes or just the Thursday or everybody.
[02:09:30.870 --> 02:09:35.870]  It's fun watching my stats move and all of my statistics on my website on Stitcher.
[02:09:35.870 --> 02:09:39.870]  iTunes doesn't show you a damn thing, but the other ones, it's fun watching the stats move.
[02:09:39.870 --> 02:09:42.870]  I really enjoy that. So thanks for listening, everybody.
[02:09:42.870 --> 02:09:46.870]  I wrote down Narcos was great. I wanted to rant about Narcos.
[02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:49.870]  That was a fucking great show. I had fun watching.
[02:09:49.870 --> 02:09:51.870]  Great two seasons so far. I'm looking forward to three.
[02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:56.870]  Yeah. Yeah. Well, spoiler alert, but I don't want to talk about how it ends, but OK, no spoiler alert.
[02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:58.870]  I guess you can't have it.
[02:09:58.870 --> 02:10:02.870]  We're safe. It's been a couple of months, but yes, spoiler alert.
[02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:07.870]  If you haven't watched Narcos, hit pause and go watch two seasons of Narcos.
[02:10:07.870 --> 02:10:12.870]  Yeah. I think that's enough for people to prepare for the spoiler.
[02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:14.870]  That ought to be good. No, you go for it.
[02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:17.870]  Well, I was familiar with the story before Narcos.
[02:10:17.870 --> 02:10:19.870]  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know how it's going to go.
[02:10:19.870 --> 02:10:27.870]  So every time they hit a major plot point or a major event and I was like, OK, I know where that falls in the timeline.
[02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:29.870]  How are they going to get more than two seasons out of this?
[02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:32.870]  And I like where they're headed for season three. I think it's a good transition.
[02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:35.870]  They're going to do the Cali Cartel. The Cali Cartel is going to be the focus.
[02:10:35.870 --> 02:10:37.870]  Yeah, that's that's a great spot to go from there.
[02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:45.870]  It's a it's a really interesting part of history that you don't often see portrayed anywhere.
[02:10:45.870 --> 02:10:54.870]  Other than I mean, even a little bit in class, if you take like a really good history class in college, maybe other than that, you've got to learn this shit on your own.
[02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:58.870]  Narcos actually did a nice job presenting it in a fun and entertaining way.
[02:10:58.870 --> 02:11:04.870]  OK, I know the story and I've read very little, but it sounds like they did a good job. That's right. I didn't know that.
[02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:11.870]  Yeah, no, they did a really nice. I don't. So I don't know about all the little stuff, but the storyline of.
[02:11:11.870 --> 02:11:16.870]  Oh, God, I'm so baked right now. The storyline that they follow is accurate.
[02:11:16.870 --> 02:11:20.870]  Nice. So I know that Murphy's going to be in the Cali Cartel show.
[02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:25.870]  Are they going to bring Pena back? I hope. Me too, because those two together, it's like the Beavis and Butthead.
[02:11:25.870 --> 02:11:28.870]  It's a perfect duo. You need both of them to keep that show balanced, I think.
[02:11:28.870 --> 02:11:36.870]  Yeah, I like both of them together. And I was glad that that was one of the things they did in the season finale was tease that they're bringing Pena back.
[02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:41.870]  I'm pulling up an article that I've got on my phone here, something we wanted to talk about to keep the show moving here.
[02:11:41.870 --> 02:11:47.870]  Just really random, fun story injection for the marijuana community. I saw this headline this week.
[02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:52.870]  There's a band somewhere attempting to write a song in for 20 time.
[02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:58.870]  And when I saw that, I thought of you specifically because you you're one of the people in my world that knows what that means.
[02:11:58.870 --> 02:12:06.870]  And I can already see he's he's got the expression like he wants to laugh, but he can't quite figure out how funny this is or how insane this is.
[02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:13.870]  How do you know something about me? There's a reason I didn't click play and like hear their attempts so far,
[02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:17.870]  because I know just enough about music to know what a nightmare that might be.
[02:12:17.870 --> 02:12:26.870]  Yeah, it's gonna be a lot of fun. Yeah, yeah, yeah. How long does it have to be to count as a song?
[02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:32.870]  I have no idea. Because that's what I like. I can probably play you six met four measures, four to four to five measures.
[02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:37.870]  That's not a problem. But after that, you're thinking three verses, two courses. Oh, God.
[02:12:38.870 --> 02:12:45.870]  At least put a bridge in there. Yeah, I could. Oh, man. And for 20 time. Yep. Four beats per measure.
[02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:55.870]  You got to do the whole bit, right? 20 counts per. Yeah, I saw that. I was like, four beats per measure and each beat gets 20 counts.
[02:12:55.870 --> 02:13:06.870]  That was one of those stories that came through right before the election that I was like, thank God there's some some people out there that are willing to do shit insane enough to make the press to just change the topic conversation even for a minute.
[02:13:07.870 --> 02:13:12.870]  Yeah, I can still see you trying to wrap your head around it. That's why I remembered the story.
[02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:20.870]  So there's a couple cool ways to do it. Are they just going to count 20 beats on the bottom? Are they going to break it down to like a basic like a like a five or four or five or something?
[02:13:20.870 --> 02:13:34.870]  Yeah. Okay, we'll figure this out. I just did it in my head. I just went 123456789101112. That's just a rock beat. 420. All right, this went way too far.
[02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:44.870]  All right, so a while back, this has been a continuing story. Ongoing story. Ongoing story. A long time ago, it feels like this feels like it happened in damn forever.
[02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:52.870]  It took happened in May of 2015. To be more precise, which in a pothead mind like mine that was damn forever back when we learned not to watch movies on the podcast.
[02:13:53.870 --> 02:14:05.870]  Alright, so there was a raid in the city of Santa Ana. Yeah, you guys remember this? Yes. The the police department came in and destroyed the dispensary. They illegally raided the dispensary. They came in, they destroyed the dispensary.
[02:14:05.870 --> 02:14:14.870]  They needlessly destroyed a bunch of TVs. They destroyed the cash register. They destroyed this display counters. They basically vandalized the shit out of this place.
[02:14:14.870 --> 02:14:43.870]  Imagine if a bunch of teenagers broke into somewhere and were pissed off and just wanted to fuck shit up. That's what they did in there. Yep. And in the process, they also stole and consumed cannabis infused edibles while on the clock while conducting a raid slash investigation while in possession of a firearm while taxpayer money was paying their salary while illegally conducting a raid of a legally functioning operating facility.
[02:14:44.870 --> 02:15:11.870]  As far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what the security video shows. Unfortunately, most of that wasn't eventually proved in the court of law. The fallout from this has been a year or more in the making. It looks like they're finally done with this. I think all of the officers that are portrayed in the video.
[02:15:12.870 --> 02:15:25.870]  His main characters, let's say the the nasty female cop who says she was going to kick the one legged old woman who was volunteering at the dispensary quote in her fucking nub.
[02:15:26.870 --> 02:15:47.870]  And then the cop that was handing out snack foods and the other cop that was eating snack foods all have resigned and the city's now paying out. What's the total? Okay. City of Santa Ana will pay $100,000 to settle lawsuit over infamous dispensary raid. Yes.
[02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:49.870]  Of taxpayer money.
[02:15:49.870 --> 02:16:00.870]  And if I remember the article, right, that money's getting split up three ways between two of the main volunteers in the dispensary and then legal counsel basically.
[02:16:00.870 --> 02:16:02.870]  That's a good business plan.
[02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:18.870]  It's not a bad way to disperse the settlement. If as far as I can tell, it's I'm glad that the city got hit with this, though. There's dispensary raids all over the place. This raid was clearly out of line from beginning to end.
[02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:25.870]  And it should have cost the police some money. It should it should sing. Totally unacceptable from start to finish.
[02:16:25.870 --> 02:16:27.870]  You know how I found out about that news article?
[02:16:27.870 --> 02:16:28.870]  Me on Twitter.
[02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:35.870]  Mike sent it to me on Twitter. You guys, if there's an article that you'd like me to read that you think I should be aware of, link it to me in Twitter.
[02:16:35.870 --> 02:16:41.870]  Just grab it. Send it to me. Send it to me on Twitter at GFYH podcast. I would appreciate it.
[02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:54.870]  It gives us more material for the show. Also, if you've got a grow question, if you've got a cannabis related question, a cannabis industry, a cannabis politics, a cannabis etiquette, a cannabis culture, whatever you want to talk about, if it's weed related shit.
[02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:58.870]  If you want to talk about music and drums, you could send me a message. I may reply about that as well.
[02:16:58.870 --> 02:17:04.870]  Grow from your heart at Hotmail.com. I'd love to hear from you. I love interaction from the people that are listening to the podcast.
[02:17:04.870 --> 02:17:11.870]  We're all friends now. You're hanging out in your car. You're in your cubicle. You're doing whatever you're doing. You're working in the warehouse, carrying boxes.
[02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:15.870]  You got your headphones in. Rasta Jeff is keeping you entertained for a little while. We're bros now.
[02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:23.870]  We're even if you're a female, we're bros. We'll still be bros. Don't worry. I don't know. I don't know what else to call you. We're bros. Trust me. Fist bump. We are bros.
[02:17:24.870 --> 02:17:33.870]  Lindsey just laughed at me. I know Lindsey put her fist up and laughed at me for that one. I know she did. Wherever she is listening to this podcast, shout out to Lindsey. She's in Florida right now.
[02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:38.870]  Listener questions and comments generate some of my favorite episodes.
[02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:39.870]  Me too, honestly.
[02:17:39.870 --> 02:17:49.870]  The content seems fresher and when we're sure that people want to know what we're about to do an episode on, it brings the energy level up.
[02:17:49.870 --> 02:17:56.870]  It's like watching people enjoy the food you cook, but I get it in advance because I already know you're going to be happy because I did an episode that you asked for.
[02:17:56.870 --> 02:17:58.870]  I got to serve up what you wanted for dinner.
[02:17:58.870 --> 02:18:02.870]  All right. And we know you guys have questions. So by all means, let them fly.
[02:18:02.870 --> 02:18:06.870]  We're 15 minutes into this podcast and we have not made any useful.
[02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:09.870]  We've got a big main topic tonight.
[02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:13.870]  It was a stressful couple of days. It's been a stressful.
[02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:15.870]  Oh man, it's been a stressful six, eight months.
[02:18:16.870 --> 02:18:20.870]  Hey guys on Facebook, can we all just shut the fuck up and be friends again? We're all in this together.
[02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:24.870]  If you agree or disagree or whatever, whatever happens is going to happen.
[02:18:24.870 --> 02:18:32.870]  Can we quit bickering and fighting and having a mud sling and dick fucking whipping contest and quit grabbing each other by the pussy and just be friends again on Facebook?
[02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:35.870]  Let's go posting cat memes and weed pictures again, please.
[02:18:35.870 --> 02:18:43.870]  It's been highly contentious for, I mean, man, I've been actively working this election since April.
[02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:48.870]  I mean, just, just wrapping my own head around that hurts.
[02:18:48.870 --> 02:18:52.870]  Mike, I gave you a shout out on an episode that I don't know if it is aired yet.
[02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:55.870]  The you and Jesse episode I heard and appreciated that.
[02:18:55.870 --> 02:18:56.870]  Those are awesome. Thank you.
[02:18:56.870 --> 02:18:59.870]  Face to face, man. Thank you. Because you came on here.
[02:18:59.870 --> 02:19:01.870]  I, all the listeners owe you a shout out.
[02:19:01.870 --> 02:19:06.870]  You came on here and kind of reminded us several times, go fucking vote.
[02:19:06.870 --> 02:19:07.870]  So it's thanks dude.
[02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:11.870]  That's the first takeaway from last night's election.
[02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:18.870]  It's kind of a weird way to jump into to the main topic tonight, but really you, you, you have to vote.
[02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:23.870]  That's I mean, it's the one thing that we all do as Americans other than pay taxes and die.
[02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:26.870]  That really unites all of us under the same thing.
[02:19:26.870 --> 02:19:30.870]  I've got right here. One of my notes, it's the one on the bottom, but I'm going to ask it first since you're here.
[02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:33.870]  Do you feel like your vote made an actual difference?
[02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:34.870]  Oh, big time.
[02:19:34.870 --> 02:19:36.870]  Okay. Look at the numbers.
[02:19:36.870 --> 02:19:41.870]  I mean, there's, there's a million different ways to rationalize.
[02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:44.870]  I didn't vote because my vote didn't matter.
[02:19:44.870 --> 02:19:55.870]  But if you actually pull up the numbers, look at your area, look at the different races, thousands and thousands and thousands of people voted in a lot of these races.
[02:19:55.870 --> 02:20:01.870]  I mean, even here in Pueblo races around the country come down to 30 votes, a hundred votes.
[02:20:01.870 --> 02:20:05.870]  Pueblo, Colorado has been a strong democratic.
[02:20:05.870 --> 02:20:18.870]  They call it a democratic stronghold back when Colorado was a hard Republican state, Denver and Pueblo were Republican or democratic in a thick Republican state.
[02:20:18.870 --> 02:20:23.870]  And I mean, for 40 years, Pueblo has been a democratic stronghold.
[02:20:23.870 --> 02:20:27.870]  And in this election, Trump won by like 240 votes.
[02:20:28.870 --> 02:20:34.870]  And literally the, our vote for president down here was decided by 240 votes.
[02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:45.870]  A couple of the county commissioner seats, which would directly impact both of our lives and any number of things locally were decided by a few hundred votes, a few thousand votes.
[02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:47.870]  And this is nationally.
[02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:58.870]  When you look at the stuff, if you look at the polling data from this election, if Gary Johnson wasn't a thing, the conversation we're about to have tonight would be very different.
[02:20:58.870 --> 02:21:06.870]  Gary Johnson running in the little tiny percent of the vote he got changed vote results all across the country.
[02:21:06.870 --> 02:21:12.870]  And that changed the outcome of the election in major, major ways.
[02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:19.870]  It's not just president. It's so easy to, I don't like the two candidates that the main parties put forward for president.
[02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:23.870]  I'm not voting just because you don't like the president.
[02:21:23.870 --> 02:21:36.870]  You just gave up all of your decisions on your Senate senators, your house of representatives, members, your local election, elect politicians, your local election issues, your local ballot issues.
[02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:38.870]  And a lot of those are really important.
[02:21:38.870 --> 02:21:43.870]  Some of those, I didn't know how important they were to me until I got my ballot and discovered that.
[02:21:43.870 --> 02:21:45.870]  I was like, oh, shit, this needs to be voted on.
[02:21:45.870 --> 02:21:53.870]  When I first started going through what was finally going to be on this election's ballot here in Colorado, I was like, what the fuck, slavery?
[02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:57.870]  Like not to yell into the microphone, but we literally voted.
[02:21:57.870 --> 02:21:59.870]  I bought this little piece down here just for those moments.
[02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:08.870]  We literally voted on abolishing essentially indentured servitude or slavery in Colorado's penal system last night.
[02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:16.870]  If I caught that vote right, we voted to end being able to force prisoners to work while they're in jail.
[02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:25.870]  It's an option, not something you have to do or we throw you in isolation or beat you or don't feed you or whatever.
[02:22:26.870 --> 02:22:28.870]  Which is kind of nuts that that's what we were doing beforehand.
[02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:40.870]  But when you see that on the ballot, you're like, wow, I've heard so much about Hillary and I've heard so much about Donald and I've heard so much about Gary, but I've heard nothing about, we still have slavery here?
[02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:44.870]  Marijuana was on the vote in nine states yesterday.
[02:22:44.870 --> 02:22:47.870]  That's another subject I wanted to hit.
[02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:48.870]  I was going to segue to that.
[02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:49.870]  You're doing well.
[02:22:49.870 --> 02:22:58.870]  Our main focus of tonight's election is or tonight's podcast is the election basically and how it relates to marijuana.
[02:22:58.870 --> 02:23:07.870]  I've been on here, I can't even tell you how many times, talking about different marijuana votes this election locally and nationally.
[02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:10.870]  So this is the wrap up episode for everybody.
[02:23:10.870 --> 02:23:11.870]  Welcome.
[02:23:12.870 --> 02:23:19.870]  Locally, we can just brush this out of the way for those of you who've been waiting on pins and needles to figure out if I still have a job.
[02:23:19.870 --> 02:23:21.870]  I do.
[02:23:21.870 --> 02:23:23.870]  200 and 300 failed here in Pueblo.
[02:23:23.870 --> 02:23:36.870]  So on the ballot were initiatives to pretty much dismantle and shut down the recreational and medical cannabis industries in the city and county of Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:44.870]  If this initiative were to have passed, there would be no more growing menu processing, which is hash making and edible making.
[02:23:44.870 --> 02:23:47.870]  They would have gotten rid of all of the regulated and licensed businesses.
[02:23:47.870 --> 02:23:48.870]  All the retail stores would have been gone.
[02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:50.870]  How many people were employed by that industry?
[02:23:50.870 --> 02:23:53.870]  1300 is the low ballpark number.
[02:23:53.870 --> 02:23:55.870]  Okay. 1300 people would not have had jobs.
[02:23:55.870 --> 02:23:58.870]  Fortunately, enough people did go out and vote.
[02:23:58.870 --> 02:24:03.870]  That's part of what gives me faith that my vote counted because I of course voted.
[02:24:03.870 --> 02:24:05.870]  One of them was like 5000 and change.
[02:24:05.870 --> 02:24:07.870]  The other one was 7000 and change.
[02:24:07.870 --> 02:24:11.870]  Both yes and no on these questions got over 20,000 votes.
[02:24:11.870 --> 02:24:12.870]  Okay.
[02:24:12.870 --> 02:24:17.870]  So literally, every vote counted this election.
[02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:20.870]  Every door that got knocked mattered.
[02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:27.870]  Had we not done the work that we did on this, these two issues, this vote could have easily gone the other way.
[02:24:27.870 --> 02:24:30.870]  I'm glad that the other team kind of started floundering at the end there.
[02:24:31.870 --> 02:24:33.870]  They ran a very bizarre campaign.
[02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:40.870]  I don't really want to get into the ins and outs of our local fight and why we won, but thank God we won.
[02:24:40.870 --> 02:24:43.870]  But it was a weird election here in Pueblo too.
[02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:48.870]  So questions 200 and 300 were voting to ban all of the licensed businesses.
[02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:55.870]  But we also had questions 2B and 2C, which we're going to allow.
[02:24:55.870 --> 02:25:04.870]  We currently allow all marijuana businesses except retail stores under Amendment 64 licensing in the city.
[02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:13.870]  So we allow medical, all the medical businesses, and we allow every type of recreational business except the retail storefront locations.
[02:25:13.870 --> 02:25:16.870]  And that was on the ballot down here in Pueblo this time too.
[02:25:16.870 --> 02:25:18.870]  Do we want the storefronts in Pueblo?
[02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:20.870]  And voters said no.
[02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:24.870]  And that question lost by like 1,100 votes.
[02:25:24.870 --> 02:25:26.870]  Wow. That's not much.
[02:25:26.870 --> 02:25:28.870]  Nope. That's one apartment building.
[02:25:28.870 --> 02:25:29.870]  Yeah, right.
[02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:32.870]  That's two or three city blocks worth of votes.
[02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:34.870]  It's not a big number.
[02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:39.870]  It's easily swingable the other way with hard work and focus.
[02:25:39.870 --> 02:25:49.870]  But, I mean, unfortunately here in Pueblo, the entire marijuana community had 100% of their efforts invested in 200 and 300 being defeated.
[02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:55.870]  And clearly from these results, we let 2B and 2C just sit ignored.
[02:25:55.870 --> 02:26:00.870]  And because of that, they lost by a very, very small margin.
[02:26:00.870 --> 02:26:02.870]  Was one of those the new cannabis tax?
[02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:03.870]  Yep.
[02:26:03.870 --> 02:26:10.870]  The city was asking if they could allow stores and if they could tax those stores at a special rate.
[02:26:10.870 --> 02:26:13.870]  And both of those questions failed as well.
[02:26:13.870 --> 02:26:19.870]  The anti-pot group theory on this is that people just voted no on everything.
[02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:25.870]  And if you look at the election results, a lot of the other questions that were asked, people also voted no.
[02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:30.870]  The public safety taxes and things like that that were on the ballot here in Pueblo all got voted down.
[02:26:31.870 --> 02:26:36.870]  So no more money for cops, no more money for police, no more money for the district attorney's office.
[02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:38.870]  How did the cigarette tax do?
[02:26:38.870 --> 02:26:39.870]  Failed statewide.
[02:26:39.870 --> 02:26:40.870]  Okay.
[02:26:40.870 --> 02:26:41.870]  Which is weird.
[02:26:41.870 --> 02:26:44.870]  I voted against my own interest in that one and voted for it.
[02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:45.870]  I voted for it.
[02:26:45.870 --> 02:26:47.870]  I know a lot of people who voted for it.
[02:26:47.870 --> 02:26:51.870]  Increasing that tax revenue would have been good for the state.
[02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:57.870]  So I know you're trying to work on the new, you really want to talk about the new medical states and the new recreational states.
[02:26:57.870 --> 02:26:59.870]  I know, but I keep procrastinating on that.
[02:26:59.870 --> 02:27:00.870]  Great, great news.
[02:27:00.870 --> 02:27:01.870]  I'm trying to Christmas you.
[02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:07.870]  The other local piece of marijuana election news is Denver's issue 300.
[02:27:07.870 --> 02:27:08.870]  Yes.
[02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:11.870]  Pueblo's issue 300 was bad.
[02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:14.870]  Denver's issue 300 was good.
[02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:21.870]  This is the question about allowing public consumption clubs in bars, restaurants, taverns,
[02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:28.870]  and then clubs that are specifically set up to be private consumption clubs in Denver County.
[02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:34.870]  That's basically the right to consume marijuana in public with your friends in an enclosed space designed for that purpose.
[02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:38.870]  Right now it's winning, but by a tiny, tiny percentage.
[02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:43.870]  It's like 50.2% to 49.9% or some shit.
[02:27:43.870 --> 02:27:44.870]  It's incredibly close.
[02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:50.870]  It's one of those races that really hammers home the point that every single vote matters.
[02:27:50.870 --> 02:27:53.870]  Yeah, if somebody would have broken down on the way to vote, it could have gone a different way.
[02:27:53.870 --> 02:27:54.870]  Yep.
[02:27:54.870 --> 02:27:55.870]  I mean, there was traffic that night.
[02:27:55.870 --> 02:27:56.870]  That vote changes.
[02:27:56.870 --> 02:27:57.870]  Uber didn't show up.
[02:27:57.870 --> 02:28:02.870]  I mean, it was very, very close, and they're still counting those with the absentee ballots.
[02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:07.870]  That vote won't be 100% finalized for another day or two now.
[02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:08.870]  Ooh, okay.
[02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:12.870]  And there's another race that's like that that we're going to get to here in a minute.
[02:28:12.870 --> 02:28:15.870]  So let's jump on to national news, guys.
[02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:16.870]  Did your issues win?
[02:28:16.870 --> 02:28:22.870]  Did the stuff that you voted for locally, what percentage of those would you say came out in your favor?
[02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:23.870]  Almost all.
[02:28:23.870 --> 02:28:24.870]  Okay.
[02:28:24.870 --> 02:28:25.870]  Good.
[02:28:25.870 --> 02:28:33.870]  It was the national stuff that didn't go my way, but we're going to get to that here in a few minutes as well.
[02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:42.870]  But most of the stuff I voted for, everybody, or not everybody in Pueblo, but the majority of voters in Pueblo seemed to agree on.
[02:28:42.870 --> 02:28:43.870]  Okay.
[02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:44.870]  Which was nice.
[02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:46.870]  It's always nice to know.
[02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:48.870]  It's like, oh, yeah, you are the majority.
[02:28:48.870 --> 02:28:50.870]  I'm so relieved about 200 and 300, man.
[02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:53.870]  I had no idea how to vote when it asked me about judges.
[02:28:53.870 --> 02:28:55.870]  Do you want this judge to retain his position?
[02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:57.870]  I was like, I have.
[02:28:57.870 --> 02:28:59.870]  There's an answer for that.
[02:28:59.870 --> 02:29:00.870]  No one does.
[02:29:00.870 --> 02:29:01.870]  Okay.
[02:29:01.870 --> 02:29:22.870]  And so in every state, there is a group of people made up of not judges, but lawyers, prosecutors, district attorneys, defense attorneys, will and probate lawyers, like all kinds of different legal professionals that are practicing in that state.
[02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:30.870]  Kind of the best of the best get put together and then come up with a retain or don't retain list, basically.
[02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:31.870]  Wow. Okay.
[02:29:31.870 --> 02:29:39.870]  And so if you Google your state and then like judge retention or whatever, you should be able to find that group in your area.
[02:29:39.870 --> 02:29:48.870]  And then they tell you, Judge Billy Bob, you should retain him because of X, Y, and Z, or you shouldn't retain him because of X, Y, and Z.
[02:29:49.870 --> 02:29:51.870]  But the way it works in practice is nobody knows.
[02:29:51.870 --> 02:29:53.870]  So everybody just votes yes.
[02:29:53.870 --> 02:29:58.870]  And so judge retention rates are like 93% or 94% across the country.
[02:29:58.870 --> 02:30:02.870]  The only judge I've had interaction with, and I'm knocking on wood, praising Jah for this one.
[02:30:02.870 --> 02:30:08.870]  The only judge I've had interaction with over the past few years was the guy that resided over my jury duty selection.
[02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:12.870]  And I don't remember his name, but if I remembered it, he'd get a, yeah, he was cool.
[02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:13.870]  Like I had nothing wrong.
[02:30:13.870 --> 02:30:15.870]  That guy was polite to me.
[02:30:15.870 --> 02:30:17.870]  He treated me like the old lady in a blouse next to me.
[02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:19.870]  I know the judge you're talking about.
[02:30:19.870 --> 02:30:23.870]  I'm spacing his name, but he's a really nice human being and he's a pretty good judge.
[02:30:23.870 --> 02:30:24.870]  He was a cool dude.
[02:30:24.870 --> 02:30:29.870]  But a lot of people in my world are in the, that live in the legal world.
[02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:35.870]  And so I always have an ear full of judge this or this judge is great.
[02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:36.870]  This judge isn't.
[02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:37.870]  Yeah.
[02:30:37.870 --> 02:30:38.870]  How about you, man?
[02:30:38.870 --> 02:30:40.870]  Did the election go your way?
[02:30:40.870 --> 02:30:41.870]  Yeah.
[02:30:41.870 --> 02:30:42.870]  For the most part.
[02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:43.870]  For what?
[02:30:43.870 --> 02:30:46.870]  For the, for you basically just told me that all the stuff I was mostly worried about, the tax, the cannabis tax.
[02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:48.870]  Sucks.
[02:30:48.870 --> 02:30:49.870]  That's not cool.
[02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:51.870]  I don't think that we should be adding extra taxes to cannabis.
[02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:52.870]  It's already expensive enough.
[02:30:52.870 --> 02:30:55.870]  I think taxing it just encourages more of the black market sale.
[02:30:55.870 --> 02:30:58.870]  I kind of figured it was going to fail for that reason.
[02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:59.870]  Yeah.
[02:30:59.870 --> 02:31:00.870]  That's a silly thing.
[02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:03.870]  And considering the tax rate that our retail stores pay already.
[02:31:03.870 --> 02:31:05.870]  I mean, it's steep enough.
[02:31:05.870 --> 02:31:13.870]  And obviously I, I'm not excited about the president that represents us now, but other than that, I guess I can live with everything else that happened.
[02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:19.870]  The national election could have some serious implications for, for marijuana nationally.
[02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:31.870]  I'm willing to trade our shitty cannabis taxes and our lack of recreational dispensaries in Pueblo city limits to allow the other states to have a jump on cannabis.
[02:31:31.870 --> 02:31:32.870]  That's fair.
[02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:33.870]  I'll go for that.
[02:31:33.870 --> 02:31:34.870]  We're covered here in Pueblo.
[02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:37.870]  Like I feel bad for the city of Pueblo is who I feel bad for.
[02:31:37.870 --> 02:31:39.870]  I'm self-sufficient when it comes to cannabis.
[02:31:39.870 --> 02:31:40.870]  So a lot of that just kind of.
[02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:48.870]  A lot of us here are, but I mean, honestly, the city's had three years and also they limited our plant count.
[02:31:48.870 --> 02:31:49.870]  Yep.
[02:31:49.870 --> 02:31:50.870]  Yes.
[02:31:50.870 --> 02:31:51.870]  In the city of Pueblo, we were allowed to grow.
[02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:53.870]  We had a hundred square feet.
[02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:54.870]  That's still the rule in the city.
[02:31:54.870 --> 02:31:56.870]  It's the County that's the County.
[02:31:56.870 --> 02:31:57.870]  Okay.
[02:31:57.870 --> 02:31:58.870]  Okay.
[02:31:58.870 --> 02:32:00.870]  So the County just did that as a County commissioner rule.
[02:32:00.870 --> 02:32:01.870]  That wasn't a vote.
[02:32:01.870 --> 02:32:04.870]  You guys, I know that sounds strange, but the city of Pueblo is like a different part of the County.
[02:32:04.870 --> 02:32:05.870]  The County is the outer area.
[02:32:05.870 --> 02:32:09.870]  That's not like that's, it gets a little more rural.
[02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:10.870]  Yep.
[02:32:10.870 --> 02:32:11.870]  That's a hard word to say when you're high enough.
[02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:13.870]  Cut this many dabs into the evening.
[02:32:13.870 --> 02:32:14.870]  Rural gets tough.
[02:32:14.870 --> 02:32:18.870]  It's a little dusty or a little more wolves and shit that direction.
[02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:19.870]  Yeah.
[02:32:19.870 --> 02:32:20.870]  The row ads are out there.
[02:32:20.870 --> 02:32:21.870]  They are row ads.
[02:32:21.870 --> 02:32:23.870]  Yes, they are dark and it's all falling apart.
[02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:24.870]  Yeah.
[02:32:24.870 --> 02:32:26.870]  So it's the County is a different area.
[02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:30.870]  So they have a little bit different rules and they actually, we did vote on uniting them.
[02:32:30.870 --> 02:32:31.870]  There was an option.
[02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:34.870]  Oh no, it was no, that was question one.
[02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:48.870]  In one seat in question, one C here in Pueblo County asked if the County commissioners had voter approval to take our current plant cap of 18 per residential property.
[02:32:48.870 --> 02:32:55.870]  If they could have our support going to the state legislature in arguing to make that rule statewide.
[02:32:56.870 --> 02:33:14.870]  And the only reason they put that on the ballot is because when County commissioners go to the state legislature and say, please make this rule, if they're able to say we put it on the ballot and a majority of our constituents supported us bringing this question to you and asking you to do this.
[02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:18.870]  The legislature listens a little more closely.
[02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:19.870]  And that's all question.
[02:33:19.870 --> 02:33:26.870]  Once he did was give the County commissioners permission to say, and the voters support us asking this of you.
[02:33:26.870 --> 02:33:27.870]  Okay.
[02:33:27.870 --> 02:33:30.870]  A lot of people freaked out about that one.
[02:33:30.870 --> 02:33:38.870]  And honestly, in all the hoopla last night today, when somebody asked me about question one, see, I space, I couldn't even remember what number it was.
[02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:43.870]  I was impressed that you have known as many numbers as quickly as you have.
[02:33:43.870 --> 02:33:46.870]  I've been breaking down data all day.
[02:33:46.870 --> 02:33:48.870]  Looking, because there was a big screw up.
[02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:50.870]  You've got data eyes.
[02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:55.870]  You've got that like computer screen face when you showed up.
[02:33:55.870 --> 02:33:57.870]  There was a screw up in Pueblo County.
[02:33:57.870 --> 02:33:59.870]  Our, our ballot was really, really long.
[02:33:59.870 --> 02:34:01.870]  This year was four pages.
[02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:16.870]  And so when they started running through these ballots through the servers for the election department, the servers got overwhelmed because there was just each chunk of information for each ballot was a little bit larger than usual because the ballot was twice as long.
[02:34:17.870 --> 02:34:34.870]  And they, they're reporting that they filled up a server and that the state election commission had to put a server in a van and floor it down here yesterday afternoon, install the server run test software on it half the evening and fire to back up our local election department.
[02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:39.870]  People went home at 3am with instructions to report back at nine.
[02:34:39.870 --> 02:34:40.870]  Wow. Yep.
[02:34:41.870 --> 02:34:46.870]  And so we were crunching as much data as we could last night and I've been looking at it all day.
[02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:50.870]  And I still hadn't looked at one see with everything else that happened last night.
[02:34:50.870 --> 02:34:52.870]  It was such a bizarre election.
[02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:54.870]  The data is really, really weird.
[02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:59.870]  We're seeing demographic changes in Colorado that we haven't seen in our lifetime.
[02:34:59.870 --> 02:35:04.870]  The population is growing here rapidly.
[02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:07.870]  People that are from here are moving.
[02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:13.870]  There are huge numbers of people from around the country that are moving here for a variety of reasons.
[02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:19.870]  And that's changing the demographics all over the state in ways nobody predicted.
[02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:23.870]  And then nationally, no one expected marijuana to do this.
[02:35:23.870 --> 02:35:25.870]  Good. Everybody was hopeful.
[02:35:25.870 --> 02:35:28.870]  But nationally, marijuana just crushed it.
[02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:32.870]  So I want to ask one more local, just a quick one, and then we'll get off the local stuff.
[02:35:32.870 --> 02:35:35.870]  You guys, I know we probably bore the shit out of you guys with just local.
[02:35:35.870 --> 02:35:37.870]  But then we're going to talk about the new states.
[02:35:37.870 --> 02:35:38.870]  They do. Shout out.
[02:35:38.870 --> 02:35:40.870]  Hashtag we like it when they like it when you ramble.
[02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:42.870]  We're going to talk about new states in just one second.
[02:35:42.870 --> 02:35:47.870]  But on the Colorado option, yeah, Mike's signal is going to kill me.
[02:35:47.870 --> 02:35:50.870]  I want to take a dab before we get to the national stuff now.
[02:35:50.870 --> 02:35:51.870]  There you go.
[02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:56.870]  On the ballot was a question about basically assisted suicide.
[02:35:56.870 --> 02:36:00.870]  What the law basically said was if a person is deemed, excuse me, I'm going to burp.
[02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:02.870]  Let me just get it out of the way.
[02:36:02.870 --> 02:36:03.870]  Okay, I'm better now.
[02:36:03.870 --> 02:36:04.870]  Way better. Excuse me.
[02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:06.870]  Well, it smells like dank ass pizza too.
[02:36:06.870 --> 02:36:09.870]  I apologize if that hits you, Mike, because it was ripe.
[02:36:09.870 --> 02:36:13.870]  So on the ballot there was, I'm calling it the assisted suicide.
[02:36:13.870 --> 02:36:14.870]  I don't remember what it's called.
[02:36:14.870 --> 02:36:17.870]  Totally fair description of the ballot.
[02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:18.870]  If you're terminally ill.
[02:36:18.870 --> 02:36:20.870]  It's medically assisted suicide.
[02:36:20.870 --> 02:36:23.870]  Yes, yes. If you're terminally ill and you're going to die within six months,
[02:36:23.870 --> 02:36:27.870]  and I think it takes two doctors to verify this, and you can't be mentally ill.
[02:36:27.870 --> 02:36:32.870]  You have to be like sound mind to say that this is what you want.
[02:36:32.870 --> 02:36:37.870]  We're only the third or fourth, maybe the fifth state to do anything like this.
[02:36:37.870 --> 02:36:44.870]  And so the law is very, very careful and meticulous about the process for this.
[02:36:44.870 --> 02:36:50.870]  And there was a lot of anti, I can't remember the ballot issue for this one,
[02:36:50.870 --> 02:36:59.870]  but the opposition campaign, their main argument was if your shitty children will euthanize you to get their inheritance quicker.
[02:36:59.870 --> 02:37:00.870]  Was the argument.
[02:37:00.870 --> 02:37:05.870]  And when people were like, but the doctors part, they were like, well, they'll just pay the doctor more.
[02:37:05.870 --> 02:37:07.870]  No, no, not at all.
[02:37:07.870 --> 02:37:08.870]  That's just silly.
[02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:13.870]  Side note, we can't get a doctor to write an extended plant count in Colorado.
[02:37:13.870 --> 02:37:15.870]  They're not going to risk their license for a plant.
[02:37:15.870 --> 02:37:18.870]  They're definitely not going to risk their license to fucking kill you.
[02:37:18.870 --> 02:37:19.870]  That is not going to happen.
[02:37:19.870 --> 02:37:20.870]  It was just a silly argument.
[02:37:20.870 --> 02:37:27.870]  And I know everybody's beliefs on this are going to vary, but I mean, because you brought it up,
[02:37:27.870 --> 02:37:29.870]  I don't mind telling the listeners that I 100% support this.
[02:37:29.870 --> 02:37:31.870]  I filled in that bubble.
[02:37:31.870 --> 02:37:32.870]  Yes, really strong.
[02:37:32.870 --> 02:37:33.870]  I was in, let's do that.
[02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:36.870]  I watched a family member shout out to my grandma.
[02:37:36.870 --> 02:37:37.870]  My grandma had a stroke.
[02:37:37.870 --> 02:37:38.870]  My grandma was a very dignified woman.
[02:37:38.870 --> 02:37:39.870]  She was bad as fuck.
[02:37:39.870 --> 02:37:40.870]  She raised six kids.
[02:37:40.870 --> 02:37:43.870]  She worked until pretty much the day she fell down and had a stroke.
[02:37:43.870 --> 02:37:44.870]  She had a solid job.
[02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:45.870]  She took care of the family.
[02:37:45.870 --> 02:37:47.870]  She took good care of her husband.
[02:37:47.870 --> 02:37:48.870]  She took good care of the grandkids.
[02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:49.870]  That's me.
[02:37:49.870 --> 02:37:50.870]  One day she had a stroke.
[02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:52.870]  She was paralyzed on her left side.
[02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:54.870]  She hated that.
[02:37:54.870 --> 02:37:58.870]  She wanted to get up and do laundry and fucking cook for us and do what grandma did.
[02:37:58.870 --> 02:38:00.870]  She couldn't do it anymore.
[02:38:00.870 --> 02:38:07.870]  I swear that when I would go visit her in the nursing home, she'd look me straight in the eye and then look at the plug for her machines.
[02:38:07.870 --> 02:38:09.870]  Like, you're the only one that would have the balls to do it.
[02:38:09.870 --> 02:38:11.870]  Will you reach over there and unplug that for me, Jeff?
[02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:12.870]  That's what my grandma was saying to me.
[02:38:12.870 --> 02:38:16.870]  She did not want to live and she couldn't speak.
[02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:17.870]  She couldn't speak anymore.
[02:38:17.870 --> 02:38:29.870]  There's so many instances in this country where, for one reason or another, we significantly prolong suffering for absolutely no reason that I can discern.
[02:38:29.870 --> 02:38:30.870]  It's almost selfish.
[02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:36.870]  Of course, I wanted my grandma still, but I did not want to have to have grandma miserable.
[02:38:36.870 --> 02:38:46.870]  If she could speak, if I would have fucking held something up and said, grandma, unplug her plug, she would have fucking smacked that unplug with whatever momentum she could generate with whatever.
[02:38:47.870 --> 02:39:10.870]  I have a family member with Parkinson's and part of them coming to terms and kind of figuring out how to live after that diagnosis was setting up basically with a number of people in their life that if the time comes that I want to go, will you help me acquire whatever I have to acquire to get that done?
[02:39:10.870 --> 02:39:13.870]  Because this law didn't exist then.
[02:39:13.870 --> 02:39:14.870]  Right.
[02:39:14.870 --> 02:39:21.870]  Because their only option was to continue to wither away while they were 100% aware of their body collapsing around them.
[02:39:21.870 --> 02:39:29.870]  I mean, it's an incredibly brutal diagnosis and this issue was close to me and I was thrilled that it passed.
[02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:31.870]  I mean, crushed it last night.
[02:39:31.870 --> 02:39:33.870]  It passed with two thirds of the vote.
[02:39:33.870 --> 02:39:34.870]  Okay.
[02:39:34.870 --> 02:39:35.870]  It didn't just win.
[02:39:35.870 --> 02:39:36.870]  It won in a landslide.
[02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:41.870]  That's one that I strongly supported because I'm going to get old one day and I don't need anybody.
[02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:43.870]  I don't want to be a burden on anybody.
[02:39:43.870 --> 02:39:44.870]  I can't.
[02:39:44.870 --> 02:39:46.870]  I'm a young, scrapping young lad.
[02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:47.870]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:39:47.870 --> 02:39:48.870]  I'm able bodied.
[02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:50.870]  If some shit needs to be done, I could probably do it.
[02:39:50.870 --> 02:39:53.870]  I don't want to be a burden on somebody.
[02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:55.870]  The wife has instructions.
[02:39:55.870 --> 02:40:00.870]  If I'm a vegetable or a burden, harvest what you can for other people and cremate the rest.
[02:40:00.870 --> 02:40:01.870]  Yep.
[02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:02.870]  Sprinkle it over a pot field.
[02:40:02.870 --> 02:40:03.870]  Yep.
[02:40:03.870 --> 02:40:04.870]  There you go.
[02:40:04.870 --> 02:40:05.870]  Yep.
[02:40:05.870 --> 02:40:06.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:06.870 --> 02:40:07.870]  Preferably with some sun.
[02:40:07.870 --> 02:40:08.870]  On the sunny side.
[02:40:08.870 --> 02:40:09.870]  All right.
[02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:10.870]  So I'm glad that one passed.
[02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:11.870]  I'm glad you supported that one.
[02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:12.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:12.870 --> 02:40:17.870]  I didn't mean to get into the right to die on this podcast, but that's how we stand on that.
[02:40:17.870 --> 02:40:18.870]  That's something I supported.
[02:40:18.870 --> 02:40:19.870]  When I saw it, I was like, that's an option?
[02:40:19.870 --> 02:40:20.870]  We're doing that?
[02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:21.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:22.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:22.870 --> 02:40:23.870]  That's something that needs to be, yeah.
[02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:24.870]  You get the right to live.
[02:40:24.870 --> 02:40:25.870]  I only got the right to die.
[02:40:25.870 --> 02:40:26.870]  That's kind of weird.
[02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:27.870]  I'm an American.
[02:40:27.870 --> 02:40:28.870]  I can put whatever I want in my body.
[02:40:28.870 --> 02:40:31.870]  That includes a cigarette and that includes Mountain Dew and that includes cheeseburgers
[02:40:31.870 --> 02:40:33.870]  and that fucking includes a bullet.
[02:40:33.870 --> 02:40:34.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:34.870 --> 02:40:35.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:35.870 --> 02:40:36.870]  Yeah.
[02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:37.870]  Free freedom.
[02:40:37.870 --> 02:40:38.870]  All right.
[02:40:38.870 --> 02:40:39.870]  So let's get to what we've been kind of hinting at.
[02:40:39.870 --> 02:40:40.870]  We didn't even mention the fucking elephant in the room.
[02:40:41.870 --> 02:40:43.870]  We got fucking the fucking Oompa Loompa is our president now.
[02:40:43.870 --> 02:40:44.870]  So grab a ride by the pussy, everybody.
[02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:45.870]  And that's all I got to say.
[02:40:45.870 --> 02:40:46.870]  Grab life by the pussy, folks.
[02:40:46.870 --> 02:40:47.870]  We've got some new States that are on team medical cannabis in 2017.
[02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:48.870]  Who's coming out of the gate with fresh cannabis?
[02:40:48.870 --> 02:40:49.870]  The first big news last night was Florida.
[02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:50.870]  Florida is now medical marijuana state.
[02:40:50.870 --> 02:40:51.870]  Welcome to the club, Florida.
[02:40:51.870 --> 02:40:52.870]  That was not an easy run for you.
[02:40:52.870 --> 02:40:53.870]  An insane amount of money was spent to get here.
[02:40:53.870 --> 02:40:54.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:40:54.870 --> 02:40:55.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:40:55.870 --> 02:40:56.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:57.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:40:57.870 --> 02:40:58.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:40:58.870 --> 02:40:59.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:40:59.870 --> 02:41:00.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:01.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:01.870 --> 02:41:02.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:03.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:04.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:04.870 --> 02:41:05.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:05.870 --> 02:41:06.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:07.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:07.870 --> 02:41:10.870]  An insane amount of money was spent to get here.
[02:41:10.870 --> 02:41:11.870]  Hola, Florida.
[02:41:11.870 --> 02:41:12.870]  Might be more appropriate.
[02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:13.870]  But welcome to the club, Florida.
[02:41:13.870 --> 02:41:14.870]  It's about time.
[02:41:14.870 --> 02:41:20.870]  It was nice to see a lot of the stuff we're talking about tonight was East Coast.
[02:41:20.870 --> 02:41:21.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:21.870 --> 02:41:22.870]  Even Bible Belt.
[02:41:22.870 --> 02:41:26.870]  Rhode Island passed a marijuana initiative, didn't they?
[02:41:26.870 --> 02:41:27.870]  Had one.
[02:41:27.870 --> 02:41:28.870]  Maine.
[02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:29.870]  Maine is who I'm thinking of.
[02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:30.870]  Maine is the maybe.
[02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:31.870]  Those are the same states in my mind, I'm sorry.
[02:41:31.870 --> 02:41:32.870]  Okay.
[02:41:32.870 --> 02:41:36.870]  Right now, Maine's, they're a recreational legalization.
[02:41:37.870 --> 02:41:43.870]  State right now, that question is winning by a tiny, tiny percentage.
[02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:44.870]  So it's been 24 hours.
[02:41:44.870 --> 02:41:45.870]  They're still counting shit.
[02:41:45.870 --> 02:41:46.870]  Yep.
[02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:47.870]  There's like fucking eight people in Maine.
[02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:50.870]  This is back to every single vote counts.
[02:41:50.870 --> 02:41:52.870]  They're counting absentee ballots.
[02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:54.870]  They're counting the military ballots.
[02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:56.870]  They're counting the fishermen ballots.
[02:41:56.870 --> 02:42:05.870]  And in a lot of places, for no reason whatsoever, people waited till yesterday to vote when they had significant other options.
[02:42:05.870 --> 02:42:08.870]  And so, I mean, people were still voting at eight o'clock last night.
[02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:14.870]  And then at eight o'clock or seven o'clock or whenever the polls close, they start counting the ballots then.
[02:42:14.870 --> 02:42:19.870]  And they don't start like, they don't get a fucking jump on it?
[02:42:19.870 --> 02:42:21.870]  For the most part, they don't even get a jump on it.
[02:42:21.870 --> 02:42:24.870]  And that's part of the reason why.
[02:42:24.870 --> 02:42:25.870]  Not in the pot industry, are they?
[02:42:25.870 --> 02:42:26.870]  Fuck.
[02:42:26.870 --> 02:42:31.870]  That's part of the reason why this stuff is so slow.
[02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:37.870]  And that's part of the reason why you don't see early vote totals for votes cast anywhere.
[02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:39.870]  Like I voted like three weeks ago.
[02:42:39.870 --> 02:42:42.870]  Yeah, I voted like two days after my ballot arrived.
[02:42:42.870 --> 02:42:43.870]  I mailed it in shortly after.
[02:42:43.870 --> 02:42:46.870]  The night of the third debate, my wife had some wine.
[02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:47.870]  I enjoyed some cannabis.
[02:42:47.870 --> 02:42:49.870]  We watched the debate.
[02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:52.870]  We still had about a half an hour to process what the fuck we just watched.
[02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:54.870]  And then we went through our ballot.
[02:42:54.870 --> 02:42:57.870]  And it was a long ballot, so it took like two hours.
[02:42:57.870 --> 02:42:59.870]  And there was a lot of freaking out while we did it.
[02:42:59.870 --> 02:43:01.870]  But they make it real easy in Colorado.
[02:43:01.870 --> 02:43:06.870]  And then there was this like two and a half, three week period where you know they fucking got votes.
[02:43:06.870 --> 02:43:08.870]  And they just won't tell you what they say yet.
[02:43:08.870 --> 02:43:13.870]  And it's real frustrating when you're doing election work because it's information that you could use.
[02:43:13.870 --> 02:43:15.870]  I was going to say they don't want to sway anything.
[02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:20.870]  Yeah, but that's part of the reason they don't do it is because if I say Jeff's winning over Mike by 10 votes,
[02:43:20.870 --> 02:43:24.870]  all of a sudden Mike's supporters have a rallying cry to get more people out.
[02:43:24.870 --> 02:43:25.870]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:43:25.870 --> 02:43:26.870]  Should I better get out there and vote?
[02:43:26.870 --> 02:43:27.870]  Yep.
[02:43:27.870 --> 02:43:30.870]  And I think that's part of what we saw nationally last night.
[02:43:30.870 --> 02:43:36.870]  How many people saw a thing saying Hillary was 85% to win two or three days ago on national media?
[02:43:36.870 --> 02:43:40.870]  So when is the next—we got four years to the next election.
[02:43:40.870 --> 02:43:43.870]  When can I start getting people to register to vote again?
[02:43:43.870 --> 02:43:45.870]  I know I just totally trainwrecked your idea.
[02:43:45.870 --> 02:43:46.870]  Immediately.
[02:43:46.870 --> 02:43:47.870]  No, immediately.
[02:43:47.870 --> 02:43:50.870]  They can do that now for the next for the 2020 election for when Michael Franti runs for president?
[02:43:50.870 --> 02:43:51.870]  Yep.
[02:43:51.870 --> 02:43:52.870]  All right.
[02:43:52.870 --> 02:43:54.870]  Franti Warren or Warren Franti.
[02:43:54.870 --> 02:43:56.870]  Even better.
[02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:57.870]  Oh, man.
[02:43:57.870 --> 02:43:59.870]  I'm pretty proud of you for that.
[02:43:59.870 --> 02:44:03.870]  You guys, it's Michael Franti from Spearhead and Uncle Warren Haynes from Government Mule.
[02:44:03.870 --> 02:44:04.870]  No, Elizabeth Warren.
[02:44:04.870 --> 02:44:06.870]  No, no, I'm going Warren Haynes from Government Mule.
[02:44:06.870 --> 02:44:07.870]  I don't give a fuck.
[02:44:07.870 --> 02:44:08.870]  I'm going Warren Haynes from Government Mule.
[02:44:08.870 --> 02:44:10.870]  I don't even know who that is.
[02:44:10.870 --> 02:44:13.870]  My Wook fans will know who we're talking about.
[02:44:13.870 --> 02:44:14.870]  No, economics.
[02:44:14.870 --> 02:44:15.870]  The Wooks out there.
[02:44:15.870 --> 02:44:17.870]  Bring on the political people.
[02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:19.870]  They're down with Elizabeth Warren.
[02:44:19.870 --> 02:44:21.870]  I'm going Warren Haynes.
[02:44:21.870 --> 02:44:24.870]  Back to our medical marijuana states, we've got Florida.
[02:44:24.870 --> 02:44:25.870]  Florida.
[02:44:25.870 --> 02:44:26.870]  Congratulations, Florida.
[02:44:26.870 --> 02:44:27.870]  Yes.
[02:44:27.870 --> 02:44:28.870]  North Dakota.
[02:44:28.870 --> 02:44:29.870]  Is that rec or medical?
[02:44:29.870 --> 02:44:30.870]  Medical.
[02:44:30.870 --> 02:44:31.870]  I'm doing all medical right now.
[02:44:31.870 --> 02:44:32.870]  Okay, good job.
[02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:34.870]  North Dakota is now a medical marijuana state.
[02:44:34.870 --> 02:44:35.870]  Arkansas.
[02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:38.870]  Welcome to the club, Arkansas.
[02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:39.870]  Dang, all welcome.
[02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:40.870]  Dang, all welcome.
[02:44:40.870 --> 02:44:41.870]  Exactly.
[02:44:41.870 --> 02:44:42.870]  Who saw that coming?
[02:44:42.870 --> 02:44:43.870]  That's fucking crazy.
[02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:51.870]  I'm 99% sure Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas all voted Trump.
[02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:53.870]  We got...
[02:44:53.870 --> 02:44:59.870]  I'm 99% sure that Florida, North Dakota, and Arkansas almost always lean conservative,
[02:44:59.870 --> 02:45:02.870]  and they still went medical.
[02:45:02.870 --> 02:45:09.870]  This is spreading in ways that were unheard of five years ago.
[02:45:09.870 --> 02:45:10.870]  Yeah.
[02:45:10.870 --> 02:45:17.870]  States that were guaranteed to never liberalize their marijuana laws are now doing so.
[02:45:17.870 --> 02:45:21.870]  I mean, in numbers that are shocking.
[02:45:22.870 --> 02:45:25.870]  Those are the three new medical states.
[02:45:25.870 --> 02:45:29.870]  I actually think that I might have two missing on my list.
[02:45:29.870 --> 02:45:31.870]  Hold on.
[02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:32.870]  What?
[02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:34.870]  What, do you have some rec states?
[02:45:34.870 --> 02:45:35.870]  No, no, no.
[02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:36.870]  They're all here.
[02:45:36.870 --> 02:45:37.870]  I think I may be missing one.
[02:45:37.870 --> 02:45:39.870]  Yeah, you told me four, and I think there were five.
[02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:40.870]  Okay, so-
[02:45:40.870 --> 02:45:41.870]  Nevada.
[02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:42.870]  Nevada failed.
[02:45:42.870 --> 02:45:43.870]  No, Nevada passed.
[02:45:43.870 --> 02:45:44.870]  Arizona failed.
[02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:46.870]  That's the one I miss in Arizona.
[02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:47.870]  There she is.
[02:45:47.870 --> 02:45:48.870]  Okay.
[02:45:48.870 --> 02:45:53.870]  Okay, so now for rec states, recreational marijuana, any adult over 21.
[02:45:53.870 --> 02:45:55.870]  California, welcome to the club, Callie.
[02:45:55.870 --> 02:45:57.870]  Amendment 64 crushed it.
[02:45:57.870 --> 02:45:58.870]  Is that...
[02:45:58.870 --> 02:45:59.870]  Do you...
[02:45:59.870 --> 02:46:02.870]  I don't even know if I want to get into the Amendment 64 debate.
[02:46:02.870 --> 02:46:06.870]  I've got friends on both sides of that battle that live in California that are on both sides
[02:46:06.870 --> 02:46:09.870]  of the industry, the big business side, the small business side.
[02:46:09.870 --> 02:46:17.870]  The last two months saw the existing industry pairing up with national anti-marijuana forces
[02:46:17.870 --> 02:46:22.870]  to fight Amendment 64, or Proposition 64 in California.
[02:46:22.870 --> 02:46:27.870]  The medical marijuana existing industry and the marijuana advocate community paired up
[02:46:27.870 --> 02:46:32.870]  with Project Sam, Lucky Kevin Cibette, and Patrick Kennedy's nightmare of an anti-marijuana
[02:46:32.870 --> 02:46:38.870]  group to fight legalization in California, largely for economic reasons.
[02:46:38.870 --> 02:46:43.870]  If marijuana's legal and real companies can invest real money and open real businesses
[02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:48.870]  and it's really regulated and it's really lab tested, I can't grow weed in my basement
[02:46:48.870 --> 02:46:50.870]  and make a living anymore.
[02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:51.870]  I saw that happen.
[02:46:51.870 --> 02:46:55.870]  I can't grow weed in my basement and take it to a store shelf and make money that way
[02:46:55.870 --> 02:46:56.870]  anymore.
[02:46:56.870 --> 02:46:57.870]  I know guys that happen too in Colorado.
[02:46:57.870 --> 02:46:59.870]  I know a lot of people that happen to in Colorado.
[02:46:59.870 --> 02:47:04.870]  That made us have to become master growers at facilities and have other ways of income.
[02:47:04.870 --> 02:47:09.870]  It's like, I'm sorry, but that's the point of legalization.
[02:47:09.870 --> 02:47:13.870]  We're not legalizing marijuana because we can't get it.
[02:47:13.870 --> 02:47:20.870]  We're not legalizing marijuana because it's hard to find or because it was too difficult
[02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:26.870]  to call my fucking dealer on my way to work and make sure he was going to be around after
[02:47:26.870 --> 02:47:27.870]  work.
[02:47:27.870 --> 02:47:30.870]  We're doing it because we're sick of that.
[02:47:30.870 --> 02:47:31.870]  We want legal.
[02:47:31.870 --> 02:47:33.870]  We want lab tested.
[02:47:33.870 --> 02:47:37.870]  We want to be able to swing by the store on our way home just like we do for the milk
[02:47:37.870 --> 02:47:39.870]  and cookies and the eggs and the chicken.
[02:47:39.870 --> 02:47:40.870]  The whiskey and the beer.
[02:47:40.870 --> 02:47:41.870]  Yep.
[02:47:41.870 --> 02:47:42.870]  And everything else.
[02:47:42.870 --> 02:47:44.870]  I don't want to have to call a friend when I want to buy sneakers.
[02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:50.870]  I don't want to wait two days because he's not answering my texts right now because he's
[02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:53.870]  with some hot new chick so I can buy a jacket.
[02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:56.870]  I don't know why people are still willing to do this for the marijuana.
[02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:57.870]  Is that a common thing?
[02:47:57.870 --> 02:47:58.870]  No, never.
[02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:59.870]  Is that a common thing with dope guys?
[02:47:59.870 --> 02:48:00.870]  It can be.
[02:48:00.870 --> 02:48:06.870]  On the Reddit marijuana forums and stuff, you see people bitching about dealer etiquette,
[02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:07.870]  customer etiquette constantly.
[02:48:07.870 --> 02:48:08.870]  That's funny.
[02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:10.870]  I forgot those.
[02:48:10.870 --> 02:48:16.870]  I would have too if I didn't keep up with parts of the online community that are still
[02:48:16.870 --> 02:48:20.870]  in illegal states that still have to deal with it.
[02:48:20.870 --> 02:48:24.870]  Do you remember when you were always wondering if the person you were meeting up with was
[02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:29.870]  going to have either the money or the product they told you they were going to have or if
[02:48:29.870 --> 02:48:32.870]  they were going to have two homies and a knife or a gun?
[02:48:32.870 --> 02:48:34.870]  You just never knew?
[02:48:34.870 --> 02:48:35.870]  Yeah.
[02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:36.870]  That's gone.
[02:48:36.870 --> 02:48:39.870]  When you go buy jeans, you don't wonder if you're going to get robbed.
[02:48:39.870 --> 02:48:44.870]  When you go buy a Big Mac, you don't have to arrange it first and then wait outside
[02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:46.870]  and then hang out for two hours so you don't look like foot traffic.
[02:48:46.870 --> 02:48:47.870]  Have exact change.
[02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:48.870]  Yep.
[02:48:48.870 --> 02:48:51.870]  You don't have to carry drumsticks in and out with you every time pretending like you're
[02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:53.870]  taking fucking drum lessons.
[02:48:53.870 --> 02:48:58.870]  You can just go to the store, buy your marijuana, know that it's not filled with pesticides
[02:48:58.870 --> 02:49:02.870]  or spider mite eggs, go home and enjoy it.
[02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:05.870]  That's why we're doing it and it comes with a lot of benefits.
[02:49:05.870 --> 02:49:10.870]  If you are a weirdo looking dude and you're carrying around portions of things that you
[02:49:10.870 --> 02:49:14.870]  need concealed, a guitar case is my favorite way to do that type of shit.
[02:49:14.870 --> 02:49:18.870]  Out in the open, you just fucking got a big old guitar case filled with whatever.
[02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:19.870]  Desperado style.
[02:49:19.870 --> 02:49:21.870]  Well, mine's usually a little more peaceful.
[02:49:21.870 --> 02:49:24.870]  I used to put shit in there, a lot of good shit in there.
[02:49:24.870 --> 02:49:26.870]  Drumsticks and stuff.
[02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:27.870]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:49:27.870 --> 02:49:30.870]  But if you've got a lot of drumsticks that you need to vacuum seal and wrap real tight,
[02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:32.870]  you can fit a lot of them in a guitar case and it just looks normal.
[02:49:32.870 --> 02:49:36.870]  You can just walk around with it and be like, oh, I'm a fucking hippie with a guitar case.
[02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:37.870]  It's no question.
[02:49:37.870 --> 02:49:41.870]  Unless someone wants to steal your guitar or a chick wants you to play a song.
[02:49:45.870 --> 02:49:48.870]  Back to the list of new rec states.
[02:49:50.870 --> 02:49:51.870]  Thank you.
[02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:56.870]  This tangent is brought to you by Blue OG from Botanico.
[02:49:57.870 --> 02:49:59.870]  Live resin makes my head spin.
[02:50:00.870 --> 02:50:03.870]  California is now a recreational marijuana state.
[02:50:03.870 --> 02:50:07.870]  Massachusetts, bringing up our first East Coast recreational state.
[02:50:07.870 --> 02:50:08.870]  Shout out to all my Mass holes.
[02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:09.870]  Yep.
[02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:10.870]  Shout out to Rob the Dig.
[02:50:10.870 --> 02:50:11.870]  Welcome to the club.
[02:50:11.870 --> 02:50:14.870]  Mass was a really, really contested race.
[02:50:14.870 --> 02:50:16.870]  There was a lot of outside money.
[02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:23.870]  There were a lot of outside anti-marijuana groups throwing their two cents and their reefer madness at the issue there.
[02:50:23.870 --> 02:50:28.870]  I've spent a little bit of time in Massachusetts, one of my best friends on the planet.
[02:50:28.870 --> 02:50:33.870]  So I went to high school and after high school, I went on fish tour and then did some panic shows.
[02:50:33.870 --> 02:50:37.870]  And 90% of that time sitting next to me in the passenger seat or the driver's seat.
[02:50:37.870 --> 02:50:39.870]  Occasionally it was my buddy Rob the Dude.
[02:50:39.870 --> 02:50:41.870]  Shout out to Rob the Dude.
[02:50:41.870 --> 02:50:42.870]  And he is in Massachusetts.
[02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:43.870]  He's a Mass hole.
[02:50:43.870 --> 02:50:49.870]  One summer we did a bunch of widespread panic shows from New Mexico all the way to Boston.
[02:50:49.870 --> 02:50:53.870]  And we missed a couple shows because the car broke, but we had a good ass time.
[02:50:53.870 --> 02:50:57.870]  But he moved to Quincy Mass, I think was kind of where he moved to.
[02:50:57.870 --> 02:51:00.870]  And we went to Boston and we went all over Massachusetts.
[02:51:00.870 --> 02:51:02.870]  And that's a conservative place.
[02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:04.870]  At the time I didn't have dreadlocks.
[02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:06.870]  I just had long, filthy hair.
[02:51:06.870 --> 02:51:08.870]  I was wearing a fish t-shirt and patchwork pants.
[02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:12.870]  And I probably either had skate shoes or no shoes because that's how I used to roll.
[02:51:12.870 --> 02:51:17.870]  And Massachusetts gave me the like, it's one big Cherry Creek.
[02:51:17.870 --> 02:51:20.870]  The Cherry Creek is like the uppity version of Dover.
[02:51:20.870 --> 02:51:23.870]  Not all of it, but a good chunk of it for sure.
[02:51:23.870 --> 02:51:24.870]  It's very conservative.
[02:51:24.870 --> 02:51:29.870]  All of the places my buddy Rob took me to felt very, everything was overpriced.
[02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:31.870]  And the cars were a little nicer than I should be driving.
[02:51:31.870 --> 02:51:33.870]  And yeah, I felt out of place at the time.
[02:51:33.870 --> 02:51:34.870]  But anyway, shout out to Rob the Dude.
[02:51:34.870 --> 02:51:38.870]  Bro, I'm glad that you can get yourself some legal cannabis here next year.
[02:51:38.870 --> 02:51:39.870]  It's going to be dope.
[02:51:39.870 --> 02:51:41.870]  Yeah, shout out for Mass. Join in the club.
[02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:42.870]  And bike. Shout out to bike also.
[02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:44.870]  Nevada.
[02:51:44.870 --> 02:51:49.870]  Now they've got legal casinos, legal prostitution, and legal weed.
[02:51:49.870 --> 02:51:51.870]  Congratulations, Nevada.
[02:51:51.870 --> 02:51:52.870]  That's awesome.
[02:51:52.870 --> 02:51:53.870]  Yeah.
[02:51:53.870 --> 02:51:56.870]  And Nevada's law, they're rec now,
[02:51:56.870 --> 02:52:02.870]  but their medical law really pushed the envelope as far as what's allowed, what's not allowed.
[02:52:02.870 --> 02:52:03.870]  Okay.
[02:52:03.870 --> 02:52:08.870]  With reciprocity, they were one of the few places where you could take your med card from any other medical state,
[02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:15.870]  walk into a Nevada medical marijuana shop, and purchase medical marijuana in Nevada.
[02:52:15.870 --> 02:52:18.870]  And like, I can't do that in California with my Colorado card.
[02:52:18.870 --> 02:52:20.870]  You can't do that in Colorado with a California card.
[02:52:20.870 --> 02:52:21.870]  Nice.
[02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:23.870]  Reciprocity is rare.
[02:52:23.870 --> 02:52:28.870]  And Nevada was the first one to step up, so I was not surprised to see them go legal marijuana.
[02:52:28.870 --> 02:52:34.870]  A lot of the anti-marijuana money spent in this campaign came from casinos.
[02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:44.870]  Not necessarily those in Nevada, but that's one of those anti-marijuana funding points that's common.
[02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:47.870]  And that's going to start changing in Nevada now, I think.
[02:52:47.870 --> 02:52:51.870]  Why wouldn't they want me to get super blazed and gamble?
[02:52:51.870 --> 02:52:55.870]  Common wisdom is because you'd spend more if you were drinking.
[02:52:55.870 --> 02:52:58.870]  I wouldn't.
[02:52:58.870 --> 02:53:02.870]  I don't go because I can't get blazed and gamble.
[02:53:02.870 --> 02:53:03.870]  Yeah.
[02:53:03.870 --> 02:53:05.870]  If I could just safely go to my hotel.
[02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:07.870]  Like, Vegas until now is zero tolerance.
[02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:15.870]  Even if there was a place where I could go, like, either smoke a joint or take a couple dabs away from the casino floor.
[02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:16.870]  Right.
[02:53:16.870 --> 02:53:17.870]  I just want to go to my hotel room.
[02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:19.870]  I don't want to dab on the casino floor.
[02:53:19.870 --> 02:53:20.870]  And it's a little fucked up I'm asking for that much.
[02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:25.870]  The last time I was in a casino, they kept bringing me a new ashtray, like, every four minutes.
[02:53:25.870 --> 02:53:27.870]  And fuck all the non-smokers.
[02:53:27.870 --> 02:53:31.870]  That was one of our last little, like, we're all going to get cancer and die together little strongholds.
[02:53:31.870 --> 02:53:38.870]  Dabbing at the slot machine would just get reckless for me because there's that couple of minutes right after you take a dab where the world is, like, spinning.
[02:53:38.870 --> 02:53:39.870]  And you're just like, oh, fuck.
[02:53:39.870 --> 02:53:40.870]  I don't need to be right at the machine there.
[02:53:40.870 --> 02:53:41.870]  I need to check out.
[02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:43.870]  That's part of why I go off and dab somewhere.
[02:53:43.870 --> 02:53:45.870]  I go to check out of what's going on.
[02:53:45.870 --> 02:53:46.870]  I'm taking a lunch break.
[02:53:46.870 --> 02:53:50.870]  Just go fucking be somewhere that's not loud and shit happening.
[02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:55.870]  You can just fucking shut your brain up, take a couple dabs, and then you got to slowly reenter.
[02:53:55.870 --> 02:53:56.870]  And just.
[02:53:58.870 --> 02:54:07.870]  I would love to, or if I had a place where I could just go take a couple dabs or smoke a joint and then go back to the tables, I'd actually go back up to Blackhawk and stuff again.
[02:54:07.870 --> 02:54:09.870]  Or Vegas would hold a little more interest for me.
[02:54:09.870 --> 02:54:10.870]  Right.
[02:54:10.870 --> 02:54:14.870]  But as it is now, it's like, yeah, I get to go drive all my drunk friends around.
[02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:15.870]  So that's a nice change.
[02:54:15.870 --> 02:54:16.870]  I'm proud of Nevada.
[02:54:16.870 --> 02:54:20.870]  And then the last one on the list, the maybe list is Maine.
[02:54:20.870 --> 02:54:22.870]  And we tease this one a little bit earlier.
[02:54:22.870 --> 02:54:26.870]  The state of Maine is currently in a very, very tight race.
[02:54:27.870 --> 02:54:32.870]  The anti-marijuana folks in Maine have already sworn to take this one.
[02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:38.870]  They're going to they're going to take it to court and ask for recount and make sure that the votes were tallied correctly.
[02:54:39.870 --> 02:54:40.870]  That's step one.
[02:54:40.870 --> 02:54:41.870]  And then they'll go from there.
[02:54:41.870 --> 02:54:46.870]  That's how close it is, because it's within a I think it's within 3000 votes total.
[02:54:47.870 --> 02:55:03.870]  And the last news report I saw said one of the counties that had gone a majority no vote for legalization, they found like another 2700 ballots, like absentee ballots that might have not been counted.
[02:55:04.870 --> 02:55:11.870]  And so there's little things like that, that they're squeezing through and making sure everything gets cleaned up that could put Maine in the no column.
[02:55:13.870 --> 02:55:15.870]  Anti legalization people are anti marijuana.
[02:55:16.870 --> 02:55:26.870]  People are already calling Maine a win because the big bad marijuana industry didn't win in a landslide because it's a tight race, because they can legally contest it.
[02:55:26.870 --> 02:55:29.870]  And as for a recount, they're putting that one in the win column.
[02:55:30.870 --> 02:55:34.870]  Unfortunately, they're they're putting it next to Arizona, which belongs in their win column.
[02:55:35.870 --> 02:55:40.870]  Legalization got crushed in Arizona, lost by a good chunk of the vote.
[02:55:41.870 --> 02:55:45.870]  My guess is it had to do specifically with that issue.
[02:55:45.870 --> 02:55:49.870]  Like we just grouped these as medical states and rec states.
[02:55:50.870 --> 02:55:53.870]  Every law in all the states we listed is different.
[02:55:54.870 --> 02:55:56.870]  They do the same thing in very, very different ways.
[02:55:57.870 --> 02:56:01.870]  And the success of the vote often depends on the nuances there.
[02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:07.870]  Had Colorado's Amendment 64 been worded differently, might not have passed.
[02:56:07.870 --> 02:56:10.870]  Right. Same thing with all the votes last night.
[02:56:11.870 --> 02:56:13.870]  And I think that's part of what we're seeing in Arizona.
[02:56:13.870 --> 02:56:18.870]  They also had a shitload of money thrown at their anti legalization campaign.
[02:56:20.870 --> 02:56:24.870]  I want to say half a million from discounts higher in two million from Sheldon Adelson.
[02:56:24.870 --> 02:56:27.870]  You guys, I usually don't I do endorse companies.
[02:56:27.870 --> 02:56:31.870]  I don't dis endorse companies very often other than this fucking headphone amp.
[02:56:33.870 --> 02:56:35.870]  We've bashed this headphone amp from I've got one that works now.
[02:56:35.870 --> 02:56:36.870]  This one is I'm not going to curse it.
[02:56:36.870 --> 02:56:39.870]  Never mind. But discount tire can eat my ass.
[02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:42.870]  Discount tire is a place where you go to get discount tires.
[02:56:42.870 --> 02:56:45.870]  Just pay regular price for fucking tires because discount tires and give me a discount.
[02:56:45.870 --> 02:56:47.870]  Anyway, they just put the word discount in there to trick you.
[02:56:47.870 --> 02:56:50.870]  They contributed heavily to keeping cannabis illegal.
[02:56:51.870 --> 02:56:52.870]  They make tires.
[02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:55.870]  Why do they give a shit if cannabis is illegal or not?
[02:56:55.870 --> 02:57:02.870]  If you if not for this for everybody, keep an eye out for who supports what?
[02:57:03.870 --> 02:57:09.870]  You'll be shocked how many companies that you spend money out money at actively take your money,
[02:57:11.870 --> 02:57:16.870]  shake your hand, turn around and spend the money you just put in their pocket against you.
[02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:24.870]  Here locally, we had a number of companies that the marijuana industry was actively supporting,
[02:57:25.870 --> 02:57:31.870]  like by choice kind of as a group that is it turns out have been actively trying to dismantle us.
[02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:37.870]  And so industry wide, there's been shifts in who we advertise with here,
[02:57:38.870 --> 02:57:42.870]  who we use for trash service here, who we use for construction work here.
[02:57:43.870 --> 02:57:45.870]  We fucking shop for meat.
[02:57:46.870 --> 02:57:49.870]  There's I mean, a couple of people came out actively against us.
[02:57:50.870 --> 02:57:53.870]  And I mean, elections have consequences.
[02:57:54.870 --> 02:57:57.870]  Your your public support and denouncement of things have consequences.
[02:57:58.870 --> 02:58:01.870]  And this is true in your area as well.
[02:58:02.870 --> 02:58:04.870]  Listeners pay attention to politics.
[02:58:04.870 --> 02:58:06.870]  This stuff affects everything you do.
[02:58:06.870 --> 02:58:10.870]  So we've got all of these states that just went wreck in medical,
[02:58:11.870 --> 02:58:16.870]  bringing our national total to eight full legal medical or legal marijuana states
[02:58:17.870 --> 02:58:22.870]  where any adult can buy marijuana if they're over 21 in a licensed and regulated store,
[02:58:23.870 --> 02:58:27.870]  eight legal states and 28 medical marijuana states.
[02:58:29.870 --> 02:58:33.870]  One in five Americans lives in an area where they can buy marijuana legally.
[02:58:33.870 --> 02:58:36.870]  It's like three in five when you do the medical.
[02:58:37.870 --> 02:58:42.870]  And now some of that 28 is CBD only oil laws in places like Utah.
[02:58:43.870 --> 02:58:48.870]  But I mean, with numbers like that, those give me hope for our national our national news,
[02:58:49.870 --> 02:58:53.870]  because, as all of you know now or have had the chance to learn,
[02:58:54.870 --> 02:58:57.870]  Trump is now our president or our president elect.
[02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:59.870]  He'll take over in January.
[02:58:59.870 --> 02:59:04.870]  And this election also gave control of the Senate to the GOP
[02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:07.870]  and the House of Representatives to the GOP.
[02:59:08.870 --> 02:59:14.870]  And in all likelihood, that group of people will be replacing three Supreme Court justices
[02:59:15.870 --> 02:59:16.870]  in the next four years.
[02:59:17.870 --> 02:59:23.870]  So the shape of American politics, that landscape is all shifting drastically under our feet.
[02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:29.870]  One of the reasons President Obama wasn't able to do a lot of the things he had campaigned on trying to do
[02:59:30.870 --> 02:59:34.870]  was because the opposition party, the Republicans held large majorities
[02:59:35.870 --> 02:59:37.870]  in either the House or the Senate during his presidency.
[02:59:38.870 --> 02:59:40.870]  So when the president wanted to do something,
[02:59:41.870 --> 02:59:43.870]  the opposition party would make it as hard as possible.
[02:59:44.870 --> 02:59:48.870]  And so I think that's a big part of why we're in this situation.
[02:59:48.870 --> 02:59:51.870]  If the president wanted to do something, the opposition party would make it as hard as possible.
[02:59:52.870 --> 02:59:56.870]  That's not going to be true for President Trump, at least for the first two years.
[02:59:57.870 --> 03:00:00.870]  He's got party majority in all of government,
[03:00:01.870 --> 03:00:04.870]  which means Trump won't eat, Trump probably get to do eat.
[03:00:05.870 --> 03:00:12.870]  For marijuana legalization, that before last night, the picture was a lot darker.
[03:00:13.870 --> 03:00:18.870]  On the campaign trail, some of President-elect Trump,
[03:00:19.870 --> 03:00:24.870]  sorry listeners, if you're conservative, that's just saying that does weird things in my brain.
[03:00:25.870 --> 03:00:35.870]  But President-elect Trump has spent a lot of time working very closely with some strong prohibitionist politicians.
[03:00:36.870 --> 03:00:41.870]  Chris Christie is a big Trump supporter, has been on the campaign trail stumping for Trump.
[03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:44.870]  Since he dropped out of the presidential race himself.
[03:00:45.870 --> 03:00:49.870]  And he was one of the people that were promising to send the army to shut us down on day one.
[03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:56.870]  Attorney General Chris Christie, the legal marijuana industry period.
[03:00:57.870 --> 03:01:08.870]  From the federal government can basically immediately void the Cole memo and the Ogden memo
[03:01:08.870 --> 03:01:13.870]  and begin doing what's necessary to enforce the Controlled Substances Act.
[03:01:14.870 --> 03:01:22.870]  Call Colorado up and say, hey, either you stop all this legal marijuana bullshit or we yank all your road funding.
[03:01:23.870 --> 03:01:26.870]  Colorado doesn't survive without federal dollars. No state does.
[03:01:27.870 --> 03:01:30.870]  That's how they got coast to coast alcohol laws in line.
[03:01:31.870 --> 03:01:39.870]  And that's been the threat all along as states have crafted their own marijuana industries in their own way.
[03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:42.870]  Like we've been doing for the last 20 years now.
[03:01:43.870 --> 03:01:48.870]  That at any point someone in federal government would yank that leash.
[03:01:49.870 --> 03:01:53.870]  And the entire industry we've built would crumble back into the black market.
[03:01:54.870 --> 03:02:03.870]  And honestly, with eight legal states, 28 medical states and an election last night where eight of nine succeeded.
[03:02:04.870 --> 03:02:07.870]  That says a lot.
[03:02:08.870 --> 03:02:13.870]  We had Republicans and Democrats turn out in big numbers last night and vote for legalization.
[03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:22.870]  Both parties were talking about whoever gets elected, job one is trying to bring the nation back together.
[03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:25.870]  Try to heal some of the divisiveness.
[03:02:26.870 --> 03:02:32.870]  And this is an issue that we're now agreeing on as a majority population.
[03:02:33.870 --> 03:02:40.870]  Not just the majority of Democrats, not just the majority of Republicans, not just the majority of young people or black people or Hispanic people.
[03:02:41.870 --> 03:02:43.870]  But the majority of Americans agree on now.
[03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:53.870]  I think it would be incredibly costly for a future Trump administration to really go after legal marijuana at this point.
[03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:55.870]  There's just too much support coast to coast.
[03:02:56.870 --> 03:03:04.870]  Now had last night's election had one state join rec and maybe two join medical, that mandate isn't there.
[03:03:05.870 --> 03:03:09.870]  I keep coming back to every vote really counts.
[03:03:10.870 --> 03:03:16.870]  When we really digest what happened on Tuesday, that's going to be what's clear.
[03:03:17.870 --> 03:03:20.870]  If you're not participating in this, you're fucked.
[03:03:21.870 --> 03:03:24.870]  The people that disagree with you get to make those decisions.
[03:03:25.870 --> 03:03:31.870]  Where we go from here is kind of anyone's guess.
[03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:34.870]  What happened starting in January?
[03:03:34.870 --> 03:03:44.870]  The difference between President-elect Trump on the campaign trail and last night's concession speech was night and day.
[03:03:45.870 --> 03:03:50.870]  That speech alone changed the conversation nationally.
[03:03:51.870 --> 03:03:54.870]  From, oh fuck, who's got a good bunker?
[03:03:55.870 --> 03:03:59.870]  To maybe we all survive this.
[03:04:00.870 --> 03:04:01.870]  Literally in one speech.
[03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:03.870]  In a lot of the national media.
[03:04:04.870 --> 03:04:08.870]  Do you think somebody grabbed him by the collar and sat him down and was like, he's the Donald?
[03:04:09.870 --> 03:04:17.870]  It's clear that for the last couple of weeks, several important people have been in conversations with Donald Trump
[03:04:18.870 --> 03:04:21.870]  explaining that President of the United States isn't a game.
[03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:24.870]  It isn't a joke. It isn't funny.
[03:04:25.870 --> 03:04:29.870]  Real repercussions. Billions of lives.
[03:04:30.870 --> 03:04:38.870]  We just gave someone who's accurately been described as Orange Hitler all of our nuclear launch codes.
[03:04:39.870 --> 03:04:42.870]  That's happening in the next couple of weeks.
[03:04:43.870 --> 03:04:51.870]  Immediately, when the election results came in last night, at like 10 o'clock, 11 o'clock at night,
[03:04:52.870 --> 03:04:57.870]  when we knew, okay, Hillary lost, Donald Trump won, she's calling him to concede the race.
[03:04:57.870 --> 03:05:02.870]  This is real. International stock markets all over the world started crashing.
[03:05:03.870 --> 03:05:07.870]  An hour and a half later, he made his concession speech and the crash stopped.
[03:05:08.870 --> 03:05:11.870]  The world is watching.
[03:05:12.870 --> 03:05:17.870]  One of the things that we forget is that planet Earth is a big idea.
[03:05:18.870 --> 03:05:19.870]  It's a very small place.
[03:05:20.870 --> 03:05:24.870]  Right now, we're 20 hours apart from every human on Earth at most.
[03:05:24.870 --> 03:05:30.870]  That means in 20 hours, the person that's furthest away on this planet from wherever you are right now
[03:05:31.870 --> 03:05:33.870]  can be shaking your hand where you're standing.
[03:05:34.870 --> 03:05:36.870]  It's a very, very small place.
[03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:39.870]  We are a leader in every way globally.
[03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:47.870]  And when we give the keys to a reality TV show contestant or host or whatever,
[03:05:48.870 --> 03:05:49.870]  the world takes notice.
[03:05:49.870 --> 03:05:50.870]  The world takes notice.
[03:05:51.870 --> 03:05:55.870]  And it's clear that someone's been in his ear for weeks emphasizing this.
[03:05:56.870 --> 03:05:59.870]  Because his entire demeanor was different last night.
[03:06:00.870 --> 03:06:04.870]  And even his supporters were running him to run out on stage and kick the podium down and be like,
[03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:06.870]  America, fuck yeah!
[03:06:07.870 --> 03:06:10.870]  Like, grab bricks, people, and some mortar. We're going to start now.
[03:06:11.870 --> 03:06:12.870]  That's what people were expecting.
[03:06:13.870 --> 03:06:17.870]  And when it didn't happen and he came off as presidential, the entire world noticed.
[03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:22.870]  The entire world noticed nine states voting on marijuana last night.
[03:06:23.870 --> 03:06:28.870]  Other nations are looking at legalizing marijuana from the government down.
[03:06:29.870 --> 03:06:31.870]  Because they see what's happening in the United States.
[03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:36.870]  They see the headache of voter put forth ballot efforts.
[03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:44.870]  And how hard it is to regulate and tax a voter initiative law
[03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:50.870]  rather than craft a legalization law from the ground up that works well in the system they've already got in place.
[03:06:51.870 --> 03:06:54.870]  Places like Uruguay, they're not waiting for the voters.
[03:06:55.870 --> 03:06:59.870]  And there's a couple other countries that were watching Florida last night.
[03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:01.870]  They were watching California last night.
[03:07:02.870 --> 03:07:05.870]  They're watching Maine now and thinking,
[03:07:06.870 --> 03:07:11.870]  we signed the same conventions the United States did that prohibit us from legalizing marijuana.
[03:07:11.870 --> 03:07:16.870]  These laws have been just as destructive here as they are there.
[03:07:17.870 --> 03:07:26.870]  Our people here deserve the same opportunity to be free of the problems these laws cause that the people in Colorado do.
[03:07:27.870 --> 03:07:28.870]  And so they're doing it themselves.
[03:07:29.870 --> 03:07:33.870]  Because elections matter. Elections have consequences.
[03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:40.870]  And if you can do this smartly from the top down, it can go a little smoother.
[03:07:41.870 --> 03:07:46.870]  Part of the reason this process is so ugly and so messy and so fucking slow.
[03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:48.870]  I'm sorry for cussing so much tonight, guys.
[03:07:49.870 --> 03:07:50.870]  Cussing out, bro. It's been fucking crazy.
[03:07:51.870 --> 03:07:54.870]  I'm so proud of myself that I haven't thrown anything in the last 48 hours.
[03:07:55.870 --> 03:07:58.870]  Part of that's because I'm always holding a rig.
[03:07:59.870 --> 03:08:03.870]  But still, I mean, it's been really, really stressful.
[03:08:04.870 --> 03:08:07.870]  And honestly, with what we're left looking at right now,
[03:08:08.870 --> 03:08:10.870]  where we go from here is anyone's guess.
[03:08:11.870 --> 03:08:15.870]  A lot of where we go from here is totally up to Donald Trump.
[03:08:16.870 --> 03:08:21.870]  Because we honestly, honestly, God just gave that man the driver's seat of the planet.
[03:08:22.870 --> 03:08:26.870]  And where he takes us is really anyone's guess.
[03:08:27.870 --> 03:08:29.870]  I mean, it's pretty clear if you've been paying attention to reality,
[03:08:30.870 --> 03:08:34.870]  a lot of his campaign promises are not at all realistic or feasible.
[03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:36.870]  They're bigly crazy.
[03:08:36.870 --> 03:08:40.870]  Yes, it's sort of like him promising that if we elected him,
[03:08:41.870 --> 03:08:42.870]  aliens would finally introduce themselves.
[03:08:43.870 --> 03:08:47.870]  But he's still going to be president for four years.
[03:08:48.870 --> 03:08:49.870]  He's still going to appoint a cabinet.
[03:08:50.870 --> 03:08:52.870]  He's still going to replace Supreme Court justices.
[03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:55.870]  He's going to do something. He's going to govern.
[03:08:56.870 --> 03:09:03.870]  Does he decide to yank our federal funding until all 50 states fall back in line with Prohibition?
[03:09:03.870 --> 03:09:09.870]  Does he finally crack the whip and say it's time to legalize nationally or at least let the states do it?
[03:09:10.870 --> 03:09:14.870]  I mean, literally every decision is a fucking coin flip at this point. No one knows.
[03:09:15.870 --> 03:09:19.870]  We hope that somebody's screaming, look how popular it is.
[03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:22.870]  It did better than almost every candidate on the ballot.
[03:09:23.870 --> 03:09:25.870]  You can't come out strongly against marijuana.
[03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:29.870]  It would kill you. But who knows?
[03:09:29.870 --> 03:09:33.870]  He could be sitting down with Chris Christie right now having a scotch and a Prozac,
[03:09:34.870 --> 03:09:35.870]  talking about how they're going to round up all the hippies.
[03:09:36.870 --> 03:09:41.870]  One of the really scary things that happened last night was private prison stocks skyrocketed.
[03:09:42.870 --> 03:09:43.870]  Yep.
[03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:46.870]  Jeff's eyebrow just went through the top of his head.
[03:09:47.870 --> 03:09:51.870]  I've been joking for days now that I hope me and all my friends end up in the same FEMA camps.
[03:09:52.870 --> 03:09:54.870]  Yep. FEMA camps are very unlikely.
[03:09:55.870 --> 03:09:57.870]  That was one of the more fun rumors about Obama's presidency.
[03:09:57.870 --> 03:10:03.870]  But, I mean, it's a possibility.
[03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:07.870]  Yeah, I'm the type of people that those people are, that they do not like.
[03:10:08.870 --> 03:10:17.870]  Well, it's 100% possible that a new administration goes a very different direction than the Obama administration has gone.
[03:10:18.870 --> 03:10:26.870]  And there's a reason legalization advocates have pushed the Obama administration as hard as they have for more on legalization.
[03:10:27.870 --> 03:10:30.870]  Every chance we've gotten, we've begged for movement.
[03:10:31.870 --> 03:10:33.870]  And we've gotten a little, but very, very little.
[03:10:34.870 --> 03:10:40.870]  And because we've only gotten a little bit of movement federally, the next administration can do whatever they want.
[03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:49.870]  They can put an end to all of this with a couple of meetings, a strategy, and like 35 phone calls.
[03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:55.870]  Or a press release is really all it would take.
[03:10:55.870 --> 03:10:56.870]  Yeah.
[03:10:57.870 --> 03:11:01.870]  Sure, there would be a lot of kicking. There'd be a lot of screaming. There'd be a lot of, hell no, we won't go.
[03:11:02.870 --> 03:11:06.870]  But in the end, you're talking about stoners versus drones.
[03:11:07.870 --> 03:11:12.870]  The way to change the laws is to participate in the system and vote.
[03:11:13.870 --> 03:11:14.870]  Right.
[03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:20.870]  And hopefully the people that are about to take power caught the mandate from last night and were paying attention.
[03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:28.870]  The only group of people that are really happy right now that I see in my social media feeds are the marijuana people.
[03:11:29.870 --> 03:11:32.870]  The hardcore marijuana people know that marijuana had a huge night last night.
[03:11:33.870 --> 03:11:35.870]  Liberals are disappointed and confused.
[03:11:36.870 --> 03:11:39.870]  Conservatives are really confused and kind of shocked.
[03:11:40.870 --> 03:11:46.870]  Stoners are happy, but I honestly think that it's a little early to be super happy.
[03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:53.870]  For those of you in states that just passed either medical or rec, get involved immediately.
[03:11:54.870 --> 03:11:55.870]  Get to city council.
[03:11:56.870 --> 03:12:04.870]  Get on your computer when you hear this and figure out what area you live in, whether it's governed by a city council or a county commission or whatever.
[03:12:05.870 --> 03:12:07.870]  Figure out when those meetings are and start going.
[03:12:08.870 --> 03:12:13.870]  Figure out when your state legislature meets and what they're talking about and if you can attend those meetings.
[03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:18.870]  Because if you're in California right now, those rules are just being written.
[03:12:19.870 --> 03:12:29.870]  All of those cities that have been passing marijuana bans leading up into the election were doing so that they had time to write rules for 64.
[03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:35.870]  So that they could pick the zoning and pick the buffer distances and pick the tax numbers.
[03:12:36.870 --> 03:12:41.870]  You need to be participating in those hearings if you want any kind of say in it.
[03:12:41.870 --> 03:12:47.870]  Otherwise, the people who do care are going to get what they want in those laws.
[03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:51.870]  Just go put your face in that mix. Go be seen.
[03:12:52.870 --> 03:12:59.870]  Humans, no matter what your job, if you're a councilman, if you're a zoning commissioner, if you make the laws, if you're the judge, if you go to whatever meeting it is,
[03:13:00.870 --> 03:13:04.870]  at the end of the meeting, there's always that 15 minutes where everybody just stands around and bullshits.
[03:13:04.870 --> 03:13:09.870]  Maybe if you're the guy like Mike that goes to every single city council meeting that he can,
[03:13:10.870 --> 03:13:14.870]  maybe one of the guys that are running that is on the fence about how they feel about you,
[03:13:15.870 --> 03:13:21.870]  maybe they'll actually walk up and actually speak to you because they just want someone to talk to for that next 10 minutes till they have to go to the next meeting.
[03:13:22.870 --> 03:13:24.870]  They want to blend in like everyone else. They don't want to seem like a dick.
[03:13:25.870 --> 03:13:28.870]  And it's socially acceptable to just walk up and talk to the other guy at that council meeting.
[03:13:29.870 --> 03:13:31.870]  You may end up putting the right bug in his ear.
[03:13:31.870 --> 03:13:38.870]  He may talk to you and realize, man, that guy is 6'5 with dreadlocks and his eyes are red and he wears a red, golden green t-shirt every day.
[03:13:39.870 --> 03:13:42.870]  But when I spoke to him, he was intelligent. He sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
[03:13:43.870 --> 03:13:45.870]  Maybe I'm not so afraid of these cannabis guys because that guy's compassionate.
[03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:50.870]  And that guy's telling me about his friend with cancer that he's helping take care of with cannabis.
[03:13:51.870 --> 03:13:54.870]  You might spark something in somebody and you may accidentally put them on your team.
[03:13:55.870 --> 03:13:58.870]  I was at a couple of different watch parties on election night.
[03:13:59.870 --> 03:14:13.870]  And when I stopped by the Democratic Watch Party, one of our local representatives in the city was asking me if I thought eight stores would be enough to dedicate a hard stream of revenue to law enforcement.
[03:14:14.870 --> 03:14:23.870]  And so I quickly turned the conversation into production facilities that we already allow or where you want that money to come from because it's a more stable revenue source.
[03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:32.870]  It was a quick two minute conversation, but it was somebody in city government who knew me from these meetings who just, they were bored at a party.
[03:14:33.870 --> 03:14:35.870]  And so they came wandering over to me to chat for five minutes.
[03:14:36.870 --> 03:14:44.870]  And so now when they're looking at the budget next week and they see that our two ballot questions about more money for law enforcement failed,
[03:14:45.870 --> 03:14:50.870]  they've got an option that they might be able to fill some of that hole with now that might not have been on the table before.
[03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:54.870]  And honestly, that's down the road for the states that just voted on it.
[03:14:55.870 --> 03:15:05.870]  If you live in California or Massachusetts or Nevada, right now your city or your county is talking about or is about to be talking about zoning rules.
[03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:11.870]  What type of land and what type of areas in our community do we want to allow production facilities?
[03:15:12.870 --> 03:15:15.870]  Do we want to allow grows or extraction labs or stores?
[03:15:16.870 --> 03:15:17.870]  How many feet from school should they be?
[03:15:17.870 --> 03:15:18.870]  What kind of labeling should we require?
[03:15:19.870 --> 03:15:20.870]  What kind of testing should we require?
[03:15:21.870 --> 03:15:27.870]  And the people that are about to make those decisions don't have a fucking clue about any of this.
[03:15:28.870 --> 03:15:29.870]  They know cannabis is a weed.
[03:15:30.870 --> 03:15:31.870]  They know that it needs water and sunlight to grow.
[03:15:32.870 --> 03:15:36.870]  And then I guess you can grow it under lights and that it's probably bad for your brain.
[03:15:37.870 --> 03:15:38.870]  And that's all they know.
[03:15:39.870 --> 03:15:47.870]  And if you don't show up to these meetings and bring reality to them, they're never going to see it.
[03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:51.870]  They're going to pass rules to regulate what's in their head.
[03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:55.870]  And you're going to get stuck with some of the rules that we get.
[03:15:56.870 --> 03:16:02.870]  And you're left explaining them to people with just, it's just a crazy rule that we follow.
[03:16:03.870 --> 03:16:05.870]  Like, why do we have to bleach our trash?
[03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:06.870]  It's just one of those things.
[03:16:07.870 --> 03:16:08.870]  Is bleach good for the environment?
[03:16:09.870 --> 03:16:10.870]  Fuck it, it's a rule.
[03:16:11.870 --> 03:16:12.870]  So, yeah, let me talk about that one.
[03:16:13.870 --> 03:16:14.870]  I ran a big grow.
[03:16:15.870 --> 03:16:18.870]  We had over a hundred lights and people would climb a barbed wire fence.
[03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:22.870]  Well, this is a statewide rule because the legislature kind of saw this coming.
[03:16:23.870 --> 03:16:26.870]  They would put carpets, old school style, like we used to do back in the day.
[03:16:27.870 --> 03:16:28.870]  Throw a carpet over the barbed wire fence.
[03:16:29.870 --> 03:16:30.870]  Fight club style.
[03:16:31.870 --> 03:16:32.870]  Graffiti style.
[03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:37.870]  Jump the fence, jump the fence, and then climb up a big pole above the trash can and jump off this pole.
[03:16:38.870 --> 03:16:40.870]  We had plastic trash can lids, the giant dumpster.
[03:16:41.870 --> 03:16:42.870]  They weren't plastic.
[03:16:43.870 --> 03:16:44.870]  They were that thick, like...
[03:16:45.870 --> 03:16:46.870]  That real hard, heavy plastic.
[03:16:47.870 --> 03:16:48.870]  Yeah, and they would smash their bodies through it.
[03:16:49.870 --> 03:16:50.870]  And then they'd get in there and steal our trash bags, which was...
[03:16:51.870 --> 03:16:52.870]  Why would we throw away weed?
[03:16:53.870 --> 03:16:54.870]  We didn't do that.
[03:16:55.870 --> 03:16:57.870]  It was sticks and stems and mainly like office trash.
[03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:59.870]  We had an office.
[03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:01.870]  There was a bathroom.
[03:17:02.870 --> 03:17:03.870]  We had a great lunch there.
[03:17:04.870 --> 03:17:09.870]  The people breaking into marijuana dumps, business dumpsters, don't know about the rules.
[03:17:10.870 --> 03:17:14.870]  Eventually we had to put stainless steel...
[03:17:15.870 --> 03:17:20.870]  Dude, these lids were so heavy that I had to get on a chair to lift them up because I couldn't get enough leverage from the one.
[03:17:21.870 --> 03:17:22.870]  They were so heavy.
[03:17:23.870 --> 03:17:26.870]  And they found a way to cut the poles, the hinges off of the ends now to get into that trash can.
[03:17:27.870 --> 03:17:28.870]  And they're on camera doing it.
[03:17:29.870 --> 03:17:30.870]  They've been pulled over and busted.
[03:17:30.870 --> 03:17:32.870]  I don't know why it does it repeatedly, but anyway, you guys, I'm off on a crazy rant.
[03:17:33.870 --> 03:17:40.870]  We've had a lot of weird rules here, mainly because when it came time to pass these rules, to write a lot of them,
[03:17:41.870 --> 03:17:45.870]  the marijuana community was busy scrambling, trying to start a business before the rules got in place
[03:17:46.870 --> 03:17:53.870]  so that they could open it their way, at their location, and hopefully get grandfathered in later when rules finally did get passed.
[03:17:54.870 --> 03:17:57.870]  The grandfather shit didn't work out too well for a lot of us, did it?
[03:17:57.870 --> 03:18:04.870]  At one point, we had over a thousand marijuana retail locations in Colorado.
[03:18:05.870 --> 03:18:10.870]  And that was the week before real regulations came down the pipe for the first time.
[03:18:11.870 --> 03:18:16.870]  At the same time that first regulation set hit, the feds came in and said,
[03:18:17.870 --> 03:18:20.870]  all right, any of you that aren't a thousand feet from a school,
[03:18:21.870 --> 03:18:24.870]  and we're going to make that thousand feet as long as possible.
[03:18:24.870 --> 03:18:28.870]  If there's the Grand Canyon between me and you, it doesn't matter.
[03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:33.870]  If we're only 995 feet apart at the opposite sides of the Grand Canyon,
[03:18:34.870 --> 03:18:36.870]  it's as the crow flies, is what they called it.
[03:18:37.870 --> 03:18:40.870]  It used to be by the foot, and then they recently changed it, and that fucked a lot of people.
[03:18:41.870 --> 03:18:44.870]  When they changed that rule, a third of our shops had to move or close down.
[03:18:45.870 --> 03:18:50.870]  And all the shops that were near 980 feet from whatever school,
[03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:52.870]  the feds said, you have to close.
[03:18:53.870 --> 03:18:57.870]  And that was the only big closure of shops we had in Colorado.
[03:18:58.870 --> 03:19:03.870]  The feds closed down about 50 of them for being too close to schools.
[03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:08.870]  And then the rules being put in place closed almost 500.
[03:19:09.870 --> 03:19:13.870]  And since then, another 150 have dropped out of the running
[03:19:14.870 --> 03:19:16.870]  because it's just too much of a headache.
[03:19:16.870 --> 03:19:19.870]  What really bothered me about a lot of the rulemaking was
[03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:24.870]  it created a scenario where guys like,
[03:19:25.870 --> 03:19:28.870]  okay, I can use Scott Reach as an example because he's gone full circle.
[03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:32.870]  Back in the day, Scott Reach from Rare Dankness opened up a dispensary.
[03:19:33.870 --> 03:19:34.870]  I think it was called White Mountain Medicine.
[03:19:35.870 --> 03:19:37.870]  That dispensary was the fucking example.
[03:19:38.870 --> 03:19:39.870]  That's what dispensaries should have been back then.
[03:19:40.870 --> 03:19:42.870]  But that was the wild, wild west when there weren't any rules.
[03:19:43.870 --> 03:19:45.870]  They were what's called the white mountain medicine.
[03:19:46.870 --> 03:19:49.870]  It was all vertically integrated before vertical integration was a thing.
[03:19:50.870 --> 03:19:51.870]  They were growing everything they were selling.
[03:19:52.870 --> 03:19:53.870]  They were producing it all.
[03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:55.870]  They were packaging it. Everything was happening in-house.
[03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:59.870]  It was all like a one-man show basically with Scott and a couple of homies.
[03:20:00.870 --> 03:20:01.870]  And then they started implementing all these new systems,
[03:20:02.870 --> 03:20:03.870]  all these new rules, all these new laws.
[03:20:04.870 --> 03:20:06.870]  And the guys that were putting their heart into the grow,
[03:20:07.870 --> 03:20:08.870]  these guys were sleeping in the grow.
[03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:11.870]  They had cots between the rows of plants where these guys would take a nap
[03:20:12.870 --> 03:20:13.870]  when the lights went off for the 12-12 cycle.
[03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:15.870]  They'd sleep in there.
[03:20:16.870 --> 03:20:17.870]  They'd go in the other room and work on that after they had a nap.
[03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:19.870]  They were killing it.
[03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:21.870]  But all the new rules forced cameras
[03:20:22.870 --> 03:20:24.870]  and so much other bullshit that they couldn't afford.
[03:20:25.870 --> 03:20:28.870]  And so the guys with heart that would love these plants got forced out.
[03:20:29.870 --> 03:20:30.870]  And the guys that own car dealerships
[03:20:31.870 --> 03:20:35.870]  and own whatever other random business that went to business school
[03:20:36.870 --> 03:20:37.870]  and just saw an opportunity in Colorado,
[03:20:38.870 --> 03:20:39.870]  they came in and they're like, well, I got money.
[03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:41.870]  And they bought shit up.
[03:20:42.870 --> 03:20:43.870]  And now unfortunately a lot of those types of folks
[03:20:44.870 --> 03:20:45.870]  are who are running the cannabis industry.
[03:20:46.870 --> 03:20:51.870]  There's still a weird lack of quality
[03:20:52.870 --> 03:20:54.870]  in large portions of the legal market here.
[03:20:55.870 --> 03:20:57.870]  Let me wrap up because I started with Scott Reach.
[03:20:58.870 --> 03:21:00.870]  I got to give Scott a shout out and finish that.
[03:21:01.870 --> 03:21:03.870]  Now Scott owns the most high-tech, most sophisticated,
[03:21:04.870 --> 03:21:05.870]  most impressive fucking grow facility
[03:21:06.870 --> 03:21:07.870]  in the state of Colorado that I've ever seen.
[03:21:08.870 --> 03:21:09.870]  And he is now producing once again
[03:21:10.870 --> 03:21:13.870]  some of the best quality cannabis in a very large scale.
[03:21:13.870 --> 03:21:15.870]  And it's available for retail purchase.
[03:21:16.870 --> 03:21:17.870]  He does the wholesale thing.
[03:21:18.870 --> 03:21:19.870]  So it ends up in dispensaries.
[03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:21.870]  So he's back at it now.
[03:21:22.870 --> 03:21:23.870]  I just had to go with that.
[03:21:24.870 --> 03:21:25.870]  He went full circle.
[03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:27.870]  I'm starting to see a lot more of the people
[03:21:28.870 --> 03:21:29.870]  who were doing it from their heart
[03:21:30.870 --> 03:21:31.870]  finally getting up and running again.
[03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:34.870]  But for a year and a half, two years, three years,
[03:21:35.870 --> 03:21:37.870]  all of them have been looking for money.
[03:21:38.870 --> 03:21:41.870]  And the people running the big production facilities
[03:21:41.870 --> 03:21:42.870]  are the people that have money
[03:21:43.870 --> 03:21:44.870]  and not the people that have talent.
[03:21:45.870 --> 03:21:49.870]  And that's led to a lot of like, wow, solid C plus.
[03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:51.870]  Right.
[03:21:52.870 --> 03:21:53.870]  I had a million dollar loan. Oh, man.
[03:21:54.870 --> 03:21:57.870]  I had somebody like excitedly show me some bud
[03:21:58.870 --> 03:22:01.870]  that was 2.2% THC, 7.7% CBD.
[03:22:02.870 --> 03:22:04.870]  Like excitedly, like this is on our shelf now, bro.
[03:22:05.870 --> 03:22:08.870]  And I kind of looked at him and he kind of looked at me.
[03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:10.870]  And then he was like, but why aren't you excited?
[03:22:11.870 --> 03:22:14.870]  You've been asking for CBD flower for a while now.
[03:22:15.870 --> 03:22:17.870]  And I was like, yeah, that ain't it though.
[03:22:18.870 --> 03:22:21.870]  Like I got more CBD like stuck to my oil slick.
[03:22:22.870 --> 03:22:24.870]  I'm sorry.
[03:22:25.870 --> 03:22:26.870]  Like I hate to brush your bubble, but.
[03:22:27.870 --> 03:22:28.870]  Get up above 10, get closer to 15.
[03:22:30.870 --> 03:22:33.870]  If you've got passion and talent and skill
[03:22:34.870 --> 03:22:37.870]  producing marijuana, you know what quality is.
[03:22:37.870 --> 03:22:40.870]  You've got a passion for helping share your love
[03:22:41.870 --> 03:22:42.870]  of marijuana with other people.
[03:22:43.870 --> 03:22:45.870]  It's really time to bite the bullet
[03:22:46.870 --> 03:22:47.870]  and start spending Mondays at city council.
[03:22:48.870 --> 03:22:49.870]  You're going to hate it.
[03:22:50.870 --> 03:22:54.870]  It's going to take you two years of really boring meetings
[03:22:55.870 --> 03:22:56.870]  that don't have anything to do with marijuana.
[03:22:57.870 --> 03:23:00.870]  And I've sat through that long public testimony sessions
[03:23:01.870 --> 03:23:04.870]  where one person gets up and said, marijuana is the devil's lettuce.
[03:23:04.870 --> 03:23:05.870]  And it's going to make everybody commit suicide.
[03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:07.870]  And then somebody gets up and say, no,
[03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:09.870]  we're going to pave the streets with gold
[03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:12.870]  and everybody's going to get two cute redheads to go home with.
[03:23:13.870 --> 03:23:16.870]  And you just argue back and forth all night long.
[03:23:17.870 --> 03:23:20.870]  But if you don't go and there isn't someone there
[03:23:21.870 --> 03:23:23.870]  to make rational arguments to the people
[03:23:24.870 --> 03:23:25.870]  that finally make these decisions in your area,
[03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:27.870]  you're going to wake up one morning
[03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:29.870]  and it's going to be a two and a half hour drive
[03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:31.870]  to the pot store.
[03:23:32.870 --> 03:23:33.870]  And you're going to have done that to yourself.
[03:23:34.870 --> 03:23:35.870]  When you get to that pot store,
[03:23:36.870 --> 03:23:37.870]  that's two and a half hours away,
[03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:39.870]  it's going to be mediocre quality
[03:23:40.870 --> 03:23:41.870]  and twice as expensive as your old dealer back home.
[03:23:42.870 --> 03:23:43.870]  And a purchase limit so that you have to do it once a damn week
[03:23:44.870 --> 03:23:45.870]  instead of once a month.
[03:23:46.870 --> 03:23:47.870]  Yep. And it's going to be your fault
[03:23:48.870 --> 03:23:49.870]  for skipping out on these meetings
[03:23:50.870 --> 03:23:52.870]  and for hoping that somebody else goes down and fights for you.
[03:23:53.870 --> 03:23:56.870]  And that's, I mean, that's my takeaway from this election
[03:23:57.870 --> 03:23:58.870]  is you got to participate.
[03:23:59.870 --> 03:24:00.870]  Yes, participate. If you did not vote in this election,
[03:24:01.870 --> 03:24:02.870]  you cannot bitch about anything for the next four years.
[03:24:02.870 --> 03:24:03.870]  That's something that I want to say.
[03:24:04.870 --> 03:24:05.870]  Mike, we've been going for a long time.
[03:24:06.870 --> 03:24:07.870]  So let's wrap it up.
[03:24:08.870 --> 03:24:09.870]  If you got any final words, do it.
[03:24:10.870 --> 03:24:11.870]  That's what I'm giving you the chance for, buddy.
[03:24:12.870 --> 03:24:13.870]  With most political issues,
[03:24:14.870 --> 03:24:18.870]  we're talking about changing what is a little bit.
[03:24:19.870 --> 03:24:23.870]  We're going to raise the age or whatever from this to that.
[03:24:24.870 --> 03:24:25.870]  It's just a little tiny insignificant change.
[03:24:26.870 --> 03:24:28.870]  We're going to give people five more years
[03:24:29.870 --> 03:24:30.870]  if they commit whatever crime.
[03:24:30.870 --> 03:24:33.870]  Most of what we're changing is already laid out.
[03:24:34.870 --> 03:24:37.870]  When it comes to stuff like marijuana legalization,
[03:24:38.870 --> 03:24:41.870]  we're changing to a whole new system.
[03:24:42.870 --> 03:24:43.870]  Nothing is laid out.
[03:24:44.870 --> 03:24:48.870]  When you're crafting stuff for people to vote on,
[03:24:49.870 --> 03:24:52.870]  how you write the issue matters.
[03:24:53.870 --> 03:24:55.870]  Once it's passed in the law in your state
[03:24:56.870 --> 03:24:57.870]  and it passes by popular vote,
[03:24:57.870 --> 03:24:59.870]  that feels like the win.
[03:25:00.870 --> 03:25:01.870]  It's not.
[03:25:02.870 --> 03:25:03.870]  That's getting invited to the game.
[03:25:04.870 --> 03:25:05.870]  It just feels like a win.
[03:25:06.870 --> 03:25:07.870]  Don't get me wrong.
[03:25:08.870 --> 03:25:10.870]  Voting on legalization as a state is amazing.
[03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:12.870]  I remember that feeling in Colorado.
[03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:15.870]  I was thinking about it a lot last night, actually.
[03:25:16.870 --> 03:25:19.870]  But it's very much the beginning of the game.
[03:25:20.870 --> 03:25:21.870]  You have not won yet.
[03:25:22.870 --> 03:25:23.870]  Right now, Oregon,
[03:25:23.870 --> 03:25:26.870]  I'm seeing that a huge number of towns, cities, and counties
[03:25:27.870 --> 03:25:28.870]  banned rec sales.
[03:25:29.870 --> 03:25:32.870]  Some of those are doing it to wait and see.
[03:25:33.870 --> 03:25:35.870]  Some of them are doing it because they fucking hate marijuana
[03:25:36.870 --> 03:25:38.870]  and they don't understand why their state legalized it.
[03:25:39.870 --> 03:25:41.870]  Some of them are doing it because they want a little more time
[03:25:42.870 --> 03:25:43.870]  to finish crafting the rules.
[03:25:44.870 --> 03:25:45.870]  But all of them are doing it
[03:25:46.870 --> 03:25:47.870]  because not enough pro-marijuana people
[03:25:48.870 --> 03:25:50.870]  are showing up to meetings and voicing their support.
[03:25:50.870 --> 03:25:53.870]  For allowing the legal marijuana industry in their area.
[03:25:54.870 --> 03:25:56.870]  Oregon is a big legalization state.
[03:25:57.870 --> 03:25:58.870]  They've been on the list for a minute now.
[03:25:59.870 --> 03:26:03.870]  And they don't have nearly the access we do here.
[03:26:04.870 --> 03:26:05.870]  And part of that is because they don't have the community
[03:26:06.870 --> 03:26:07.870]  that we have here.
[03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:09.870]  They don't have the activists that we have here
[03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:11.870]  that are fighting for it.
[03:26:12.870 --> 03:26:14.870]  And for places like Massachusetts, Nevada, Maine,
[03:26:15.870 --> 03:26:16.870]  Florida, North Dakota, Arkansas,
[03:26:17.870 --> 03:26:19.870]  you guys need to start doing something.
[03:26:20.870 --> 03:26:21.870]  You need to start hitting those meetings.
[03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:24.870]  You need to figure out how these rules get made in your area.
[03:26:25.870 --> 03:26:27.870]  It's going to take a lot of time.
[03:26:28.870 --> 03:26:29.870]  I know a lot of you should be at work
[03:26:30.870 --> 03:26:31.870]  and don't have time to dedicate to this.
[03:26:32.870 --> 03:26:34.870]  But that's kind of how I became me.
[03:26:35.870 --> 03:26:37.870]  I was the guy that didn't have work on Monday nights.
[03:26:38.870 --> 03:26:42.870]  I was the guy who already had a background in law and politics
[03:26:43.870 --> 03:26:44.870]  and was willing to bite the bullet
[03:26:45.870 --> 03:26:46.870]  and go to a couple of these meetings.
[03:26:47.870 --> 03:26:48.870]  That was like eight years ago.
[03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:50.870]  It's a long fight.
[03:26:51.870 --> 03:26:55.870]  To get wherever you are to where we are now in Colorado,
[03:26:56.870 --> 03:26:57.870]  it's going to take people like me
[03:26:58.870 --> 03:26:59.870]  willing to step up and go to the meetings.
[03:27:00.870 --> 03:27:03.870]  I'm happy for you guys to hit me up on social media,
[03:27:04.870 --> 03:27:05.870]  ask me for tips and tricks.
[03:27:06.870 --> 03:27:07.870]  If you're having trouble finding something out,
[03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:10.870]  I'm happy to help you research it.
[03:27:11.870 --> 03:27:12.870]  You just got to let me know.
[03:27:13.870 --> 03:27:15.870]  And more importantly, you've got to get out there and do it.
[03:27:16.870 --> 03:27:17.870]  How can they reach you?
[03:27:18.870 --> 03:27:20.870]  The easiest way, honestly, is through Facebook.
[03:27:21.870 --> 03:27:24.870]  If you send a message to Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws,
[03:27:25.870 --> 03:27:26.870]  that will get to me.
[03:27:27.870 --> 03:27:30.870]  That will get to my pocket with a nice notification.
[03:27:31.870 --> 03:27:33.870]  You can tweet me at Nemopunk15.
[03:27:35.870 --> 03:27:39.870]  Mainly my Twitter was to annoy prohibitionists online
[03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:42.870]  and I have officially been blocked by all of them.
[03:27:43.870 --> 03:27:45.870]  So mainly I just use that for sharing news stories
[03:27:45.870 --> 03:27:47.870]  with the little Twitterverse.
[03:27:48.870 --> 03:27:49.870]  Troll from your heart.
[03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:51.870]  Yeah, troll from your heart, bro.
[03:27:52.870 --> 03:27:53.870]  Portland for positive impact rules.
[03:27:54.870 --> 03:27:59.870]  But yeah, you can get me on either of those
[03:28:00.870 --> 03:28:01.870]  and I'm happy to answer all your questions.
[03:28:02.870 --> 03:28:03.870]  I think that last dab just kicked in
[03:28:04.870 --> 03:28:05.870]  because I looked down at your phone and I was like,
[03:28:06.870 --> 03:28:07.870]  yeah, we should listen to some music.
[03:28:08.870 --> 03:28:09.870]  I know, I'm just getting a song lined up
[03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:11.870]  for the end of the podcast.
[03:28:12.870 --> 03:28:13.870]  I had nothing to do with any of that.
[03:28:13.870 --> 03:28:14.870]  This has been our election episode.
[03:28:15.870 --> 03:28:17.870]  I hope we hit what you were hoping for us to hit.
[03:28:18.870 --> 03:28:19.870]  If we didn't, that's what emailing Jeff is all about.
[03:28:20.870 --> 03:28:21.870]  Yes, yes.
[03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:23.870]  If you want to email me, if you want more details,
[03:28:24.870 --> 03:28:25.870]  I think we went for about an hour and a half here.
[03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:27.870]  So I hope we covered everything you wanted to hear.
[03:28:28.870 --> 03:28:29.870]  There is a big election, y'all.
[03:28:30.870 --> 03:28:31.870]  Sorry for the rambling.
[03:28:32.870 --> 03:28:33.870]  No, Mike, I appreciate it.
[03:28:34.870 --> 03:28:35.870]  I love the content.
[03:28:36.870 --> 03:28:37.870]  I love that when you come and be on the podcast,
[03:28:38.870 --> 03:28:39.870]  I love it when you ramble.
[03:28:40.870 --> 03:28:41.870]  You guys send me an email if you want to.
[03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:42.870]  I love to hear from you.
[03:28:43.870 --> 03:28:45.870]  Man, the future is, let's see what happens.
[03:28:46.870 --> 03:28:47.870]  I'm excited.
