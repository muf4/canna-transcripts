[00:01.400 --> 00:03.400]  Hey, what's up podcast world?
[00:03.400 --> 00:04.780]  It's your boy Rasta Jeff.
[00:04.780 --> 00:08.300]  Before I start episode 150, I wanted to drop in and say thank you to everyone that listens
[00:08.300 --> 00:11.300]  to the podcast and everyone who has ever been on the podcast.
[00:11.300 --> 00:15.580]  150 episodes means a lot to me and I appreciate all of the support.
[00:15.580 --> 00:18.600]  Also this podcast was recorded live at the Canna Canyon.
[00:18.600 --> 00:21.900]  From about six minutes till 10 minutes, it gets a little noisy.
[00:21.900 --> 00:26.260]  I tried to fix it the best I could, but it sounds a little crappy and I do apologize.
[00:26.260 --> 00:29.660]  After 10 minutes, it'll be crystal clear and you'll enjoy the show.

[02:34.210 --> 02:35.210]  Wait, Lindsey, did you just say that you're too stoned?
[02:35.210 --> 02:36.210]  Is that what you just said?
[02:36.210 --> 02:37.210]  Yeah, I was for one.
[02:37.210 --> 02:44.210]  I'm going to hand you this microphone so that we can hear what you're saying.

[02:45.210 --> 02:46.210]  I mean, I might have.

[02:50.210 --> 02:53.210]  Everybody, welcome to the Grow From Your Heart podcast, the 150th episode.
[02:53.210 --> 02:58.210]  I don't know if anybody at this table knew there was number 150.

[03:05.210 --> 03:06.810]  Let me slowly introduce everybody here.
[03:06.810 --> 03:09.810]  Ladies and gentlemen, to my left, back again to try to get this right this damn time.
[03:09.810 --> 03:13.810]  I apologize for screwing it up the first time, but joining me is a beautiful Dabbing Granny
[03:13.810 --> 03:14.810]  is to my left.
[03:14.810 --> 03:15.810]  Welcome back to the show, honey.
[03:15.810 --> 03:16.810]  Oh, Jeff, I'm so excited to be here.
[03:16.810 --> 03:17.810]  Thanks for having me.
[03:17.810 --> 03:18.810]  It's so good to be here with you again.
[03:18.810 --> 03:19.810]  Thanks for coming back.
[03:19.810 --> 03:20.810]  Thanks for being patient with me.
[03:20.810 --> 03:21.810]  No worries.
[03:21.810 --> 03:26.810]  You know, it was terrible that my SD card failed, but I'm excited that everyone's back
[03:26.810 --> 03:27.810]  again.
[03:27.810 --> 03:28.810]  It's kind of exciting.
[03:28.810 --> 03:30.810]  So sitting to the left of Dabbing Granny is my new friend.
[03:30.810 --> 03:31.810]  They call him THC Sam.
[03:31.810 --> 03:32.810]  He is Sam from THC Magazine.
[03:32.810 --> 03:33.810]  Dude, thanks for joining me.
[03:33.810 --> 03:34.810]  Thank you very much for having me.
[03:34.810 --> 03:35.810]  On Instagram, it's THC underscore Samuel.
[03:35.810 --> 03:36.810]  Yeah, I appreciate being included.
[03:36.810 --> 03:37.810]  Awesome, man.
[03:37.810 --> 03:40.810]  Next, let me get the mic a little closer because I'm not sure we got you too much, but I'll
[03:40.810 --> 03:41.810]  make sure that we pump you up.
[03:41.810 --> 03:42.810]  You're good, bro.
[03:42.810 --> 03:43.810]  You're good.
[03:43.810 --> 03:44.810]  Welcome to the podcast.
[03:44.810 --> 03:45.810]  I'll guide you.
[03:45.810 --> 03:46.810]  Don't worry.
[03:46.810 --> 03:47.810]  And now the guy that's excited, you're bouncing in your chair, bro.
[03:47.810 --> 03:50.810]  Mr. Instagram over there, Mr. Fish Eye on the phone.
[03:50.810 --> 03:51.810]  Terp Pimp.
[03:51.810 --> 03:52.810]  Terp Pimp.
[03:52.810 --> 03:55.810]  Since everyone here is a Terp, or he is a Terp slut, he's our Terp Pimp.
[03:55.810 --> 03:56.810]  I'm not a slut.
[03:56.810 --> 03:57.810]  I'm not a slut.
[03:57.810 --> 03:58.810]  I'm not a slut.
[03:58.810 --> 03:59.810]  I'm the white Terp Pimp.
[03:59.810 --> 04:00.810]  You are the Terp.
[04:01.810 --> 04:02.810]  But it's all good.
[04:02.810 --> 04:03.810]  That name was given to me.
[04:03.810 --> 04:04.810]  I did not declare that myself.
[04:04.810 --> 04:05.810]  You're not the self-proclaimed Terp Pimp?
[04:05.810 --> 04:06.810]  No, no.
[04:06.810 --> 04:07.810]  I did not proclaim that myself.
[04:07.810 --> 04:08.810]  It's Rooster Brat the Terp Pimp.
[04:08.810 --> 04:09.810]  Anything Granny says to me, I'll take.
[04:09.810 --> 04:10.810]  It's official.
[04:10.810 --> 04:11.810]  It's official shit once Granny says it.
[04:11.810 --> 04:12.810]  Welcome to the show, brother.
[04:12.810 --> 04:13.810]  Brent is, of course, the lab manager at Evo Labs.
[04:13.810 --> 04:14.810]  He is partially responsible for all these beautiful cannabis-extracted terpines that
[04:14.810 --> 04:15.810]  we've been enjoying, and we truly appreciate it.
[04:15.810 --> 04:16.810]  We're going to talk about terpine extraction.
[04:16.810 --> 04:17.810]  We're going to talk about terpine extraction.
[04:17.810 --> 04:18.810]  We're going to talk about terpine extraction.
[04:18.810 --> 04:19.810]  We're going to talk about terpine extraction.
[04:19.810 --> 04:20.810]  We're going to talk about terpine extraction.
[04:31.790 --> 04:34.790]  try to pry into his business a little bit here in the future.
[04:34.790 --> 04:40.790]  But across the table is one of my heroes, the guy that makes the fucking tables with
[04:40.790 --> 04:41.790]  emails built into them.
[04:41.790 --> 04:42.790]  Holy shit.
[04:42.790 --> 04:43.790]  Yes, what up, guys?
[04:43.790 --> 04:44.790]  It's my buddy Bobo Blasterco.
[04:44.790 --> 04:45.790]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[04:45.790 --> 04:46.790]  Thank you for having me here.
[04:46.790 --> 04:47.790]  Good.
[04:47.790 --> 04:48.790]  Thanks for coming up to the Canyon Canyon and hanging out.
[04:48.790 --> 04:49.890]  I'm so happy to be here.
[04:49.890 --> 04:54.990]  I was a little jelly I wasn't here for the first one, so I'm happy I could be here.
[04:54.990 --> 04:55.990]  You were on the beach with a dog?
[04:55.990 --> 04:56.990]  I was still jealous about it.
[04:56.990 --> 04:59.090]  When I heard, we were at Candy Canyon,
[04:59.090 --> 05:01.130]  I was like, oh, the Terps, I was like, oh, man.
[05:01.130 --> 05:02.830]  I was like, a huge sesh, that's awesome.
[05:02.830 --> 05:05.790]  Yeah, on these cozy couches with Dad and Granny hanging out.
[05:05.790 --> 05:06.630]  Yeah, thanks for joining us.
[05:06.630 --> 05:08.270]  And orange soda.
[05:08.270 --> 05:10.910]  And this orange soda hash that Granny brought.
[05:10.910 --> 05:11.930]  Last time it was so wonderful,
[05:11.930 --> 05:13.650]  she went and got more for us.
[05:13.650 --> 05:16.810]  She says that if this hash keeps becoming available
[05:16.810 --> 05:19.310]  from Incredibles, she's gonna go broke.
[05:19.310 --> 05:24.310]  No, I will be down on Nevada, in my high heels,
[05:24.670 --> 05:29.210]  and my red lips, and my painted fingernails.
[05:29.210 --> 05:32.090]  Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.,
[05:32.090 --> 05:35.750]  all donations to Dad and Granny on that corner post.
[05:35.750 --> 05:40.750]  And now, please, please, do not go through the Terp pimp.
[05:41.750 --> 05:44.570]  You must go through the Traveling Stoner.
[05:44.570 --> 05:47.430]  She is my official manager for Nevada.
[05:47.430 --> 05:49.330]  So let's introduce to the podcast,
[05:49.330 --> 05:51.170]  the official, the Traveling Stoner,
[05:51.170 --> 05:53.130]  Dad and Granny's Terp pimp.
[05:53.150 --> 05:55.030]  This podcast started off wonderfully.
[05:55.030 --> 05:56.830]  Wait, wait, wait, wait, if she's a Terp pimp.
[05:56.830 --> 05:59.230]  Granny's already on the corner of the scenario.
[05:59.230 --> 06:01.070]  Can we work together or something?
[06:01.070 --> 06:03.730]  You can get her and I can get your guy or something.
[06:03.730 --> 06:04.730]  Yeah, I got you.
[06:04.730 --> 06:05.570]  Awesome.
[06:05.570 --> 06:06.410]  I got you, you can have him.
[06:06.410 --> 06:08.850]  Did this show just become Tinder?
[06:08.850 --> 06:09.810]  What just happened over here?
[06:09.810 --> 06:13.450]  Bender, Tinder, Grinder, whatever those things are.
[06:13.450 --> 06:15.050]  All right, all right, welcome to the show, everybody.
[06:15.050 --> 06:15.890]  Thank you guys for joining me.
[06:15.890 --> 06:18.510]  Podcast listeners, I'm gonna put this show
[06:18.510 --> 06:19.550]  back on track a little bit.
[06:19.550 --> 06:20.730]  We're here live at the Cannon Canyon,
[06:21.690 --> 06:23.990]  Colorado Springs' premier social lounge
[06:23.990 --> 06:26.090]  where you can come and if you're 21 and over,
[06:26.090 --> 06:27.930]  you do not need a medical marijuana card.
[06:27.930 --> 06:30.690]  If you're 21, you have an ID and you're not a dick,
[06:30.690 --> 06:31.810]  you can come here, you can hang out,
[06:31.810 --> 06:33.690]  you can sign a member agreement.
[06:33.690 --> 06:35.010]  There may be products available
[06:35.010 --> 06:36.610]  that if they share it with you,
[06:36.610 --> 06:38.250]  you may reimburse them for the products
[06:38.250 --> 06:39.370]  that are available here.
[06:39.370 --> 06:41.370]  Oftentimes there are some tasty hashes,
[06:41.370 --> 06:42.910]  there are tasty flowers here.
[06:42.910 --> 06:43.810]  Come check it out.
[06:43.810 --> 06:45.730]  Make sure you tip your bud tenders.
[06:45.730 --> 06:47.850]  Be kind to everybody and clean up after yourself.
[06:47.850 --> 06:48.690]  You can join us.
[06:48.690 --> 06:50.690]  You might come take some dabs with Bobo Blaster Co.
[06:51.530 --> 06:53.810]  Dabbing Granny, you never know who could be here.
[06:53.810 --> 06:56.650]  The Traveling Stoner is here quite frequently.
[06:56.650 --> 06:58.170]  You might get to meet Bitty the dog.
[06:58.170 --> 06:59.810]  You may meet Sirius.
[06:59.810 --> 07:00.630]  Come check it out.
[07:00.630 --> 07:01.470]  This place is cool as shit.
[07:01.470 --> 07:02.290]  It's classy as fuck.
[07:02.290 --> 07:03.610]  The couches are comfy.
[07:03.610 --> 07:05.390]  The air conditioning is kicking and it's the summertime,
[07:05.390 --> 07:07.090]  so this is the place to be.
[07:07.090 --> 07:08.510]  Dabbing Granny, I see you here a lot
[07:08.510 --> 07:10.490]  now that I've bumped into you and met you.
[07:10.490 --> 07:12.410]  This is my favorite dab lounge.
[07:12.410 --> 07:13.250]  This is your favorite?
[07:13.250 --> 07:16.250]  This is like sitting in somebody's living room.
[07:16.250 --> 07:17.730]  I love it that there are no TVs here.
[07:17.730 --> 07:19.910]  All the other social lounges have TVs
[07:19.950 --> 07:21.990]  and everyone just zones out into a TV.
[07:21.990 --> 07:23.990]  Or there's pool tables.
[07:23.990 --> 07:28.990]  This is like mine, sitting down, dabbing,
[07:29.510 --> 07:32.830]  talking, exchanging knowledge, and giggles.
[07:32.830 --> 07:34.690]  Lots of giggles today, oh my goodness.
[07:34.690 --> 07:37.410]  Exchanging terps, exchanging growth knowledge.
[07:37.410 --> 07:39.170]  I made a new friend.
[07:39.170 --> 07:42.750]  My friend Sam over here has also experienced a head injury
[07:42.750 --> 07:44.010]  and he's writing a book about it.
[07:44.010 --> 07:46.110]  Can we talk about your book?
[07:46.110 --> 07:47.270]  Get a little closer, a little closer.
[07:47.270 --> 07:48.910]  You're good, we'll get you introduced.
[07:49.030 --> 07:50.630]  When do you plan, sorry, you heated up a nail
[07:50.630 --> 07:51.590]  and then I started talking to you.
[07:51.590 --> 07:54.310]  You're gonna miss that dab opportunity, I apologize.
[07:54.310 --> 07:56.190]  When do you expect your book to come out?
[07:56.190 --> 07:57.870]  I don't know, I have to finish it over the next few years.
[07:57.870 --> 07:59.230]  Over the next few years, okay.
[07:59.230 --> 08:01.350]  When you have that book prepared, I'd love to read it
[08:01.350 --> 08:02.810]  and have you on the show and talk about it
[08:02.810 --> 08:04.710]  because it's great talking to other people
[08:04.710 --> 08:07.390]  that have experienced traumatic brain injuries.
[08:07.390 --> 08:09.530]  Well, thankfully, I grew up in a,
[08:09.530 --> 08:12.350]  my parents were pretty big fans of holistic medicine,
[08:12.350 --> 08:14.510]  so I didn't really, they weren't too big of a fan
[08:14.510 --> 08:18.030]  to put me right on any kind of pharmaceuticals, thankfully.
[08:18.030 --> 08:20.150]  Good, good, so the parents were looking out for you then?
[08:20.150 --> 08:22.150]  Yeah, so thankfully, that was a pretty great decision
[08:22.150 --> 08:24.030]  on their part and actually to speak something else,
[08:24.030 --> 08:25.590]  to speak on something else besides head injuries,
[08:25.590 --> 08:28.490]  when I was in college, I blew out some ligaments in my knee,
[08:28.490 --> 08:30.950]  so cannabis is much more of an effective pain reliever
[08:30.950 --> 08:32.710]  than a lot of the opioids that you get prescribed
[08:32.710 --> 08:35.070]  so quickly and in such large doses.
[08:35.070 --> 08:36.750]  So cannabis is really just something
[08:36.750 --> 08:38.710]  that a lot of people should really be more aware of
[08:38.710 --> 08:41.270]  and if even not aware of, just more accepting of.
[08:41.270 --> 08:42.550]  Right, and no addiction.
[08:42.550 --> 08:43.390]  Right.
[08:43.390 --> 08:45.470]  And you don't go down that black spiral of cannabis.
[08:45.470 --> 08:47.790]  Cannabis is good for you, excellent.
[08:48.550 --> 08:49.390]  Dude, thanks for joining me on the podcast.
[08:49.390 --> 08:50.210]  Thank you so much for having me.
[08:50.210 --> 08:51.950]  Yeah, I'd love to read your book when it's available.
[08:51.950 --> 08:52.790]  Thank you.
[08:52.790 --> 08:54.110]  If you need any insight or you want to talk about it,
[08:54.110 --> 08:55.230]  I'd love to hear more about that.
[08:55.230 --> 08:56.590]  Thank you so much, and also, if everybody
[08:56.590 --> 08:58.030]  could check out The Hemp Connoisseur.
[08:58.030 --> 08:59.350]  That's where I was headed next, perfect.
[08:59.350 --> 09:00.190]  Awesome.
[09:00.190 --> 09:01.030]  You are the new boy.
[09:01.030 --> 09:02.550]  Yeah, this man's on top of it with me.
[09:02.550 --> 09:03.750]  Yeah, tell me more about your magazine.
[09:03.750 --> 09:04.590]  I'd love to hear more about it.
[09:04.590 --> 09:06.310]  Yeah, I'm a writer and photographer with THC Magazine,
[09:06.310 --> 09:08.070]  The Hemp Connoisseur, based out of Denver,
[09:08.070 --> 09:10.350]  but we actually recently just went national.
[09:10.350 --> 09:11.790]  We have copies of the new national,
[09:11.790 --> 09:14.790]  the new summer edition in Barnes & Nobles across the country.
[09:14.790 --> 09:18.550]  So we hope everybody can be on the lookout for that.
[09:18.550 --> 09:19.710]  Lots of content.
[09:19.710 --> 09:21.230]  Yeah, tons of content.
[09:21.230 --> 09:22.950]  Really great, well-done magazine.
[09:22.950 --> 09:23.790]  Thank you, we appreciate it.
[09:23.790 --> 09:25.110]  We'll get a picture of the copy you gave me.
[09:25.110 --> 09:27.350]  I'll post an Instagram shot of this magazine.
[09:27.350 --> 09:28.190]  Thank you so much.
[09:28.190 --> 09:29.470]  Yeah, and if everybody wants to follow
[09:29.470 --> 09:30.790]  The Hemp Connoisseur on Instagram as well,
[09:30.790 --> 09:31.610]  we'd appreciate that.
[09:31.610 --> 09:33.090]  We're trying to get everybody kind of more aware of hemp
[09:33.090 --> 09:34.170]  and everything that it can do,
[09:34.170 --> 09:35.470]  as well as everything that cannabis does.
[09:35.470 --> 09:36.950]  We're kind of trying to really spread the message.
[09:36.950 --> 09:38.190]  Sorry, it's our sister plant.
[09:38.190 --> 09:39.030]  Yeah, absolutely.
[09:39.030 --> 09:41.110]  And it's classified as the same thing, unfortunately,
[09:41.110 --> 09:42.910]  even though it's a textile and not a...
[09:42.910 --> 09:45.790]  Brett, what are you so excited about over there?
[09:45.790 --> 09:50.790]  Yeah, he also wrote this dope-ass article from Dreamlives.
[09:50.950 --> 09:53.910]  And I see some really nice pieces
[09:53.910 --> 09:55.750]  that I'd love to reach sometime.
[09:55.750 --> 09:58.350]  Yeah, this has like a real nice wide array
[09:58.350 --> 10:01.870]  of like everything in the cannabis community.
[10:01.870 --> 10:03.150]  It's got a little bit of glass,
[10:03.150 --> 10:05.650]  it's got a little bit of edible knowledge,
[10:05.650 --> 10:07.790]  a little grow knowledge.
[10:07.790 --> 10:08.630]  It's got a lot.
[10:08.630 --> 10:09.470]  Excellent magazine.
[10:09.470 --> 10:10.830]  Thanks for joining us, Sam.
[10:10.830 --> 10:12.430]  Thank you guys very much, we appreciate it.
[10:12.950 --> 10:14.350]  Brett, let's talk about terps, buddy.
[10:14.350 --> 10:15.550]  Oh, terps.
[10:15.550 --> 10:16.390]  I'm kind of building it up
[10:16.390 --> 10:17.470]  so we can save granny a little bit.
[10:17.470 --> 10:18.310]  We're hyping it up.
[10:18.310 --> 10:20.630]  Yeah, I like terps, though.
[10:20.630 --> 10:21.510]  Terps.
[10:21.510 --> 10:23.710]  I'll turn granny on for you, it's all good.
[10:23.710 --> 10:25.750]  It's terps talk.
[10:25.750 --> 10:27.750]  I think granny loves terps more than life itself.
[10:27.750 --> 10:28.590]  I do.
[10:28.590 --> 10:29.410]  She loves when we talk about terps.
[10:29.410 --> 10:30.550]  I love how cocky you are.
[10:30.550 --> 10:33.390]  Like, I feel like that's my favorite part about you, Brett.
[10:33.390 --> 10:34.630]  I just love Brett.
[10:34.630 --> 10:35.470]  I know.
[10:35.470 --> 10:36.310]  How can you not love Brett?
[10:36.310 --> 10:37.150]  He's so good. Honestly.
[10:37.150 --> 10:39.670]  Yeah, he's just a walking smile with terps in his pocket.
[10:39.670 --> 10:40.750]  What could go wrong?
[10:40.750 --> 10:41.590]  Honestly.
[10:43.390 --> 10:44.230]  I like it.
[10:44.230 --> 10:46.030]  He's a walking smile with terps in his pocket.
[10:46.030 --> 10:47.990]  That's probably the best compliment I've ever gotten.
[10:47.990 --> 10:48.830]  Well, I appreciate that.
[10:48.830 --> 10:49.670]  I liked it, I liked it.
[10:49.670 --> 10:50.910]  Yeah, so tell us more about,
[10:50.910 --> 10:53.470]  so we recorded this podcast before,
[10:53.470 --> 10:56.950]  and I asked, explain to me what a terp is,
[10:56.950 --> 10:58.710]  nice and easily, so that everybody,
[10:58.710 --> 11:01.910]  keep in mind that more than 50% of my listeners
[11:01.910 --> 11:04.390]  are from a place where cannabis is illegal,
[11:04.390 --> 11:08.270]  so they know very basic knowledge about cannabis.
[11:08.270 --> 11:09.870]  So let's break it down to where
[11:09.870 --> 11:11.950]  they're able to follow along with us.
[11:12.830 --> 11:13.870]  Definitely, definitely.
[11:13.870 --> 11:17.870]  Well, terpenes are in basically every type of,
[11:20.630 --> 11:23.190]  well, there's two different types of things
[11:23.190 --> 11:25.470]  that could be in fruits or vegetables and stuff like that.
[11:25.470 --> 11:30.470]  Terpenes or esters, but a lot of stuff that you get
[11:32.070 --> 11:34.470]  either a smell from or a taste from
[11:34.470 --> 11:38.230]  comes from some type of terpene combination.
[11:38.230 --> 11:42.470]  And terpenes are in apples, oranges, bananas,
[11:42.470 --> 11:44.430]  everything, they also are in cannabis.
[11:45.510 --> 11:48.630]  Now, from my understanding, as of right now,
[11:48.630 --> 11:51.830]  there hasn't been any esters found in cannabis,
[11:51.830 --> 11:54.030]  but there are tons of terpenes.
[11:54.030 --> 11:59.030]  And there are over 115 terpenes, 150 terpenes,
[11:59.950 --> 12:04.870]  that make up kind of a plant profile,
[12:04.870 --> 12:09.870]  yet right now the best labs can maybe test for 30 of them.
[12:10.110 --> 12:10.950]  Okay.
[12:10.950 --> 12:13.310]  Maybe the best labs.
[12:13.310 --> 12:15.710]  And I honestly don't even know how accurate
[12:15.710 --> 12:19.110]  those 30 terpenes to testing is actually
[12:19.110 --> 12:20.430]  how accurate they are.
[12:20.430 --> 12:23.710]  But, and then after that, there's some companies
[12:23.710 --> 12:27.070]  that can go for 15 or even 10.
[12:27.070 --> 12:32.070]  So, I mean, that's basically,
[12:32.310 --> 12:34.590]  there's a whole bunch of different terpenes
[12:35.350 --> 12:37.190]  that make up a plant profile.
[12:37.190 --> 12:39.390]  So the terps are basically what give
[12:39.390 --> 12:41.190]  a cannabis plant its smell.
[12:41.190 --> 12:44.350]  Its smell, its taste, but also there's a lot more
[12:44.350 --> 12:46.110]  than just smell and taste to it.
[12:46.110 --> 12:48.310]  And this guy, Sam, next to me,
[12:48.310 --> 12:51.510]  knows a lot about the health benefits
[12:51.510 --> 12:54.590]  and actually knows a lot about terpenes.
[12:54.590 --> 12:56.630]  And that's what actually the big article
[12:56.630 --> 12:58.270]  in the magazine is about.
[12:58.270 --> 13:02.710]  And he knows a lot about the health benefits.
[13:02.710 --> 13:05.790]  There is a lot of stuff to do with the floral,
[13:05.790 --> 13:07.350]  the smell of it, the taste of it.
[13:07.350 --> 13:11.630]  And that's what most people that buy it only understand,
[13:11.630 --> 13:13.670]  but I have learned a lot from Sam about it.
[13:13.670 --> 13:15.030]  I like the way Sam set up.
[13:15.030 --> 13:18.470]  He knows his shit when it comes to this.
[13:18.470 --> 13:20.350]  I'm in this, I'm here.
[13:20.350 --> 13:21.910]  I wouldn't say I'm like a total expert,
[13:21.910 --> 13:24.870]  but I've definitely had a chance to learn
[13:24.870 --> 13:27.030]  a little bit about terpenes on a little bit
[13:27.030 --> 13:28.950]  of a different level, which is cool.
[13:28.950 --> 13:30.910]  That's one of the articles in the summer edition
[13:30.910 --> 13:31.830]  of the Hemp Connoisseur.
[13:31.830 --> 13:32.670]  Excellent.
[13:32.670 --> 13:33.510]  Good timing.
[13:33.510 --> 13:34.350]  And terpenes.
[13:34.350 --> 13:36.590]  Let him know you also worked as an expert.
[13:36.590 --> 13:38.630]  You worked in as, okay.
[13:38.630 --> 13:39.950]  Get that out.
[13:39.950 --> 13:41.950]  No, we'll just keep going.
[13:41.950 --> 13:46.510]  So basically, as popular as terpenes are for flavor,
[13:46.510 --> 13:48.790]  they do a lot more medically.
[13:48.790 --> 13:50.590]  I actually had a chance to talk with Max Montrose.
[13:50.590 --> 13:52.070]  He's the head of the Tricome Institute.
[13:52.070 --> 13:57.070]  And he is probably the terpene head, the terpene expert.
[13:57.070 --> 13:59.390]  So he gave me a really nice little education.
[13:59.390 --> 14:03.350]  And terpenes are basically, the way he described it
[14:03.350 --> 14:05.550]  and the way that I kind of explained it in the article
[14:05.550 --> 14:07.270]  is basically like a glass of beer.
[14:07.270 --> 14:09.110]  So when you have a fresh cannabis plant,
[14:09.110 --> 14:11.210]  that's a fresh glass of beer with all of those bubbles
[14:11.210 --> 14:13.350]  floating off, all that carbonation floating up to the top.
[14:13.350 --> 14:15.250]  Over time, that disappears.
[14:15.250 --> 14:16.790]  Over time with a fresh cannabis plant,
[14:16.790 --> 14:18.490]  those fresh oils, those fresh terpenes
[14:18.490 --> 14:20.870]  on the end of the plant are gonna disappear over time.
[14:20.870 --> 14:22.750]  And those not only add flavor,
[14:22.750 --> 14:24.950]  but they also add, depending on the terpene,
[14:24.950 --> 14:25.990]  a lot of medical benefits.
[14:25.990 --> 14:28.190]  Some of them are anti-psychotic, they're anti-seizure,
[14:28.190 --> 14:29.750]  they're anti-inflammatory.
[14:29.750 --> 14:31.230]  They do a whole lot of different things
[14:31.230 --> 14:32.790]  that we're just really starting to learn about.
[14:32.790 --> 14:36.190]  Also, depending on what time of harvest you do
[14:36.190 --> 14:38.350]  with the plant, you can also pull
[14:38.350 --> 14:39.870]  different terpenes with it too.
[14:39.870 --> 14:41.870]  I know that, Jeff, I don't know if you,
[14:41.870 --> 14:43.270]  I mean, you grow a lot more than I do,
[14:43.270 --> 14:45.710]  but I know that if you chop plants,
[14:45.710 --> 14:48.350]  certain plants early or certain plants late,
[14:48.350 --> 14:52.790]  you can get a higher CBG or CBN rate usually.
[14:52.790 --> 14:56.390]  And that can actually help with what, in the end,
[14:56.390 --> 14:58.270]  what terpenes you pull off that plant.
[14:58.270 --> 14:59.350]  That makes a lot of sense.
[14:59.350 --> 15:02.110]  Also the heat, how much heat that plant is affected,
[15:02.110 --> 15:04.350]  touched by, how much light is put onto it.
[15:04.350 --> 15:06.030]  Yeah, there are definitely ways that the plant
[15:06.030 --> 15:09.190]  can be affected to increase and decrease specific terpenes.
[15:09.190 --> 15:10.670]  And really what fascinated me most,
[15:10.670 --> 15:12.470]  I think, about my conversation with Max Montrose
[15:12.470 --> 15:15.190]  is really that what people think is the medical benefit
[15:15.190 --> 15:16.430]  coming from cannabinoids
[15:16.430 --> 15:18.330]  might really be coming from terpenes.
[15:18.330 --> 15:20.950]  So it's really kind of, you have to really combine the two
[15:20.950 --> 15:22.910]  to really get a full picture of really what's happening.
[15:22.910 --> 15:26.870]  Because every strain has CBD, CBN, CBG,
[15:26.870 --> 15:29.230]  depending on the strain to some ratio.
[15:29.230 --> 15:31.790]  But what really differs, what really differentiates,
[15:31.790 --> 15:34.230]  excuse me, a lot of strains is that terpene profile.
[15:34.230 --> 15:36.230]  Because not every strain is going to have
[15:36.230 --> 15:37.830]  that certain combination of terpenes.
[15:37.830 --> 15:40.750]  So the combination of that terpene profile
[15:40.750 --> 15:42.550]  and the cannabinoids in that specific strain
[15:42.550 --> 15:44.790]  kind of contribute to the overall effect
[15:44.790 --> 15:46.990]  and the overall medical benefit that people get.
[15:46.990 --> 15:47.830]  I like it.
[15:47.830 --> 15:50.350]  I've noticed when I take a small dab
[15:50.350 --> 15:52.590]  and I dunk it into a little bit of Terps,
[15:53.270 --> 15:54.790]  I get way higher than I would get from a dab,
[15:54.790 --> 15:57.190]  a little bit bigger than that dab size,
[15:57.190 --> 15:58.030]  if that makes any sense.
[15:58.030 --> 15:59.190]  Yeah, so there's still studies going on.
[15:59.190 --> 16:01.990]  I definitely understand what Sam's talking about
[16:01.990 --> 16:04.870]  and I have read about it and I do have talked to Max.
[16:04.870 --> 16:08.350]  And I do know that there are still more studies,
[16:08.350 --> 16:09.510]  hopefully, that there's going to be
[16:09.510 --> 16:11.790]  even bigger studies going on, obviously,
[16:11.790 --> 16:14.670]  with the advancement of cannabis in this community,
[16:14.670 --> 16:15.510]  hopefully more studies.
[16:15.510 --> 16:18.910]  But what Sam was saying is really true,
[16:18.950 --> 16:23.310]  how without terpenes, cannabinoids might not
[16:24.190 --> 16:26.990]  transfer in your brain or transfer in your body
[16:26.990 --> 16:27.870]  the same way.
[16:27.870 --> 16:32.950]  So that's what kind of might, there's still studies,
[16:32.950 --> 16:34.070]  don't quote me, obviously,
[16:34.070 --> 16:36.750]  but I know that there's people talking about
[16:37.670 --> 16:42.630]  without the terpenes, you can't get the same effect.
[16:42.630 --> 16:44.950]  And it's kind of true, because I've felt it.
[16:44.950 --> 16:47.630]  I mean, you don't get the full,
[16:49.070 --> 16:50.710]  I've said before that it wouldn't.
[16:50.710 --> 16:53.710]  Wouldn't a good example be taking the distillate
[16:55.670 --> 17:00.510]  which is pretty much all the terps are pulled out.
[17:00.510 --> 17:04.790]  So when you smoke that by itself,
[17:04.790 --> 17:06.350]  which you're not supposed to do,
[17:06.350 --> 17:08.590]  we're not advocating that at all.
[17:10.430 --> 17:12.030]  We can smoke distillate by itself, right?
[17:12.030 --> 17:12.870]  Yeah.
[17:12.870 --> 17:14.070]  Yeah, but I mean, you should put some terps in it.
[17:14.070 --> 17:14.910]  It could taste good.
[17:14.910 --> 17:16.350]  It tastes way better with terps.
[17:16.350 --> 17:17.190]  I'm not gonna say 100% better with terps.
[17:18.190 --> 17:19.430]  In my opinion.
[17:19.430 --> 17:21.590]  Well, depending on what distillate, what?
[17:21.590 --> 17:22.430]  You think it's good?
[17:22.430 --> 17:23.270]  It's still great by itself.
[17:23.270 --> 17:25.870]  You want 100% amazing with the terps.
[17:25.870 --> 17:28.350]  It's like sugar on your cereal.
[17:28.350 --> 17:30.630]  Yes, it just puts it on a whole new level.
[17:30.630 --> 17:32.190]  It's so interesting on the cornflakes.
[17:32.190 --> 17:35.950]  I smoke distillate honestly every day, all day.
[17:35.950 --> 17:36.790]  Oh, I mean, I smoke a lot of-
[17:36.790 --> 17:37.630]  No flavors?
[17:37.630 --> 17:39.790]  I mean, I do put terps in it sometimes,
[17:39.790 --> 17:41.590]  but honestly, sometimes not.
[17:41.590 --> 17:44.270]  I mean, I don't mind raw distillate.
[17:44.310 --> 17:46.310]  And I know Jeff actually took a nice,
[17:47.150 --> 17:51.110]  he tried to take a nice half gram dab of some distillate
[17:51.110 --> 17:53.430]  one night at the secret session.
[17:53.430 --> 17:55.870]  I just walked up, I had this half gram distillate
[17:55.870 --> 17:56.710]  left in my pocket.
[17:56.710 --> 17:59.070]  I was like, who wants to take this right now to the dome?
[17:59.070 --> 18:00.910]  And Jeff honestly was like-
[18:00.910 --> 18:01.750]  I'll do that.
[18:01.750 --> 18:02.590]  I'll do that right now.
[18:02.590 --> 18:03.630]  I'll take that dab, let's do this.
[18:03.630 --> 18:04.470]  So that was pretty cool.
[18:04.470 --> 18:05.950]  It seemed like you were on your way
[18:05.950 --> 18:07.150]  to ask a specific question.
[18:07.150 --> 18:08.910]  Did you get to ask what you were trying to ask?
[18:08.910 --> 18:09.870]  I like how Sam-
[18:09.870 --> 18:11.670]  I have a brain fart now.
[18:11.670 --> 18:13.190]  I don't even know.
[18:13.190 --> 18:16.190]  But I do want to say, wow, nice pressing.
[18:16.190 --> 18:17.030]  Look at that.
[18:17.030 --> 18:19.750]  That was, it's all about this awesome-
[18:19.750 --> 18:21.110]  Rebel's glass.
[18:21.110 --> 18:21.950]  I mean, guys-
[18:21.950 --> 18:24.150]  Rebel's iron, his iron has little presses.
[18:24.150 --> 18:25.150]  These things are awesome.
[18:25.150 --> 18:28.030]  Let's give a big shout out to this local artist,
[18:28.030 --> 18:29.070]  Rebel's Glass.
[18:29.070 --> 18:31.550]  I brought my Rebel recycler with me, of course.
[18:33.190 --> 18:35.990]  It just so happens my little iron matches.
[18:35.990 --> 18:36.830]  Yeah.
[18:37.950 --> 18:38.990]  It kind of sold me now.
[18:38.990 --> 18:40.790]  I kind of need to get one now.
[18:40.790 --> 18:42.790]  Those little irons are adorable.
[18:43.190 --> 18:45.750]  It presses it so unbelievably.
[18:45.750 --> 18:48.030]  I've been trying to use tons of little tools
[18:48.030 --> 18:52.350]  and bottom of jars and little flat glass surfaces
[18:52.350 --> 18:56.470]  I could find, but this thing is perfect.
[18:56.470 --> 19:00.030]  You can press out a really wide piece of solventless.
[19:00.030 --> 19:01.870]  Let's explain what we're talking about a little bit.
[19:01.870 --> 19:03.950]  Because like I said, people are listening in on the art.
[19:03.950 --> 19:07.710]  So it's literally a two inch by one inch,
[19:07.710 --> 19:09.550]  it really looks like a glass iron.
[19:09.550 --> 19:12.630]  So like an iron that you would iron your clothes with,
[19:13.470 --> 19:16.630]  but just glass and you would heat that up to press out
[19:16.630 --> 19:20.710]  some of this full melt ice hash that we have here.
[19:20.710 --> 19:21.550]  That we're-
[19:21.550 --> 19:22.390]  Fold it between a piece of parchment paper.
[19:22.390 --> 19:23.230]  Yes.
[19:23.230 --> 19:24.430]  Heat the iron a little bit, just press it out.
[19:24.430 --> 19:25.270]  Just press it out.
[19:25.270 --> 19:26.110]  Make it flat.
[19:26.110 --> 19:27.430]  You're just ironing it out, just like a shirt.
[19:27.430 --> 19:29.750]  Trying to get all the creases out of it,
[19:29.750 --> 19:31.190]  get it all flat and get turpy.
[19:31.190 --> 19:32.790]  Doesn't goop up on the nail.
[19:32.790 --> 19:33.710]  It doesn't get as funky.
[19:33.710 --> 19:34.550]  I'm gonna have you come over
[19:34.550 --> 19:37.150]  and iron my shirts for me sometime.
[19:37.150 --> 19:38.670]  With that little tiny iron.
[19:38.670 --> 19:41.470]  And the big difference is,
[19:41.470 --> 19:44.750]  that does not leave your nail black.
[19:44.750 --> 19:46.990]  Yes, that solventless does burn nice and clean.
[19:46.990 --> 19:48.430]  Lindsay, it looks like you're trying to sneak something in.
[19:48.430 --> 19:49.270]  What you got to say?
[19:49.270 --> 19:51.470]  Yeah, because I'm really sad how much you like those irons.
[19:51.470 --> 19:53.110]  Because there was two purple ones.
[19:53.110 --> 19:54.830]  Granny got one of them and there was another one.
[19:54.830 --> 19:56.790]  And I was like, oh man, I should scoop that
[19:56.790 --> 19:57.870]  because it matches his rig.
[19:57.870 --> 19:59.590]  And I was like, yo, he's not gonna want that.
[19:59.590 --> 20:01.150]  He's gonna be like, why'd you buy me an iron?
[20:01.150 --> 20:01.990]  And now you love it.
[20:01.990 --> 20:03.390]  And I'm like, crap, that one's gone.
[20:03.390 --> 20:04.830]  And I feel so bad.
[20:04.830 --> 20:07.230]  That's the way life goes sometimes.
[20:07.230 --> 20:09.110]  All right, we're talking about terps.
[20:09.110 --> 20:09.950]  Ask away.
[20:09.950 --> 20:10.790]  Granny was onto something about terps.
[20:10.790 --> 20:11.610]  Ask away.
[20:11.610 --> 20:13.070]  Distillate.
[20:13.070 --> 20:14.710]  Granny was thinking that we,
[20:14.710 --> 20:17.230]  Oh, I was, no, my point was that,
[20:17.230 --> 20:18.070]  It can be hard.
[20:18.070 --> 20:22.710]  I do believe you get a better medicated feeling
[20:22.710 --> 20:25.790]  once you add any of the terps.
[20:25.790 --> 20:30.750]  Like I like in the morning, I like that lemon gee.
[20:30.750 --> 20:31.590]  Oh God, you know I love my lemon gee.
[20:31.590 --> 20:34.190]  Or the ghost train haze.
[20:34.190 --> 20:36.030]  That's wonderful for in the morning.
[20:36.070 --> 20:37.390]  That's my two favorites, Granny.
[20:37.390 --> 20:38.230]  All the time.
[20:38.230 --> 20:43.070]  At night, zenberry or that blackberry kush.
[20:43.070 --> 20:44.110]  Definitely, definitely.
[20:44.110 --> 20:45.790]  I mean, that's what I was saying.
[20:45.790 --> 20:49.470]  I know, I personally feel that without terpenes,
[20:49.470 --> 20:53.030]  cannabinoids wouldn't transfer in your body the right way.
[20:53.030 --> 20:55.590]  Or the same way as, I don't wanna say the right way,
[20:55.590 --> 20:58.630]  the same way as they do right now with terpenes.
[20:58.630 --> 21:00.390]  I know one thing is I love terps.
[21:00.390 --> 21:01.230]  I love terps too.
[21:01.230 --> 21:02.950]  I think all of us do.
[21:02.950 --> 21:04.990]  I asked Mike Pest, he got Mike's at every direction.
[21:04.990 --> 21:08.110]  He was like, the paparazzi came and asked him a question.
[21:08.110 --> 21:10.070]  My question, I forgot the question, I know.
[21:10.070 --> 21:12.630]  Do you, can you give me examples of like
[21:12.630 --> 21:15.270]  what specific terpenoids work for specific conditions,
[21:15.270 --> 21:16.110]  what they may help with?
[21:16.110 --> 21:17.630]  Because we already know, a lot of us know
[21:17.630 --> 21:20.550]  that like high THC strains will work well for seizures.
[21:20.550 --> 21:23.310]  High CBD works good for like epilepsy.
[21:23.310 --> 21:25.350]  Oh, he's got an article in his hand to refer to.
[21:25.350 --> 21:27.870]  I love it when people come with research.
[21:27.870 --> 21:29.030]  This is gonna be awesome.
[21:29.030 --> 21:31.110]  Guys, we're gonna learn what terpenoids will help
[21:31.110 --> 21:32.150]  with specific ailments.
[21:32.150 --> 21:34.510]  He's pulling out a chart, helping them find the right page.
[21:34.510 --> 21:36.990]  Shout out to his page turner, Brett, over there.
[21:36.990 --> 21:38.750]  So I guess the first example that I'm looking at
[21:38.750 --> 21:39.910]  right here is Humaline.
[21:41.070 --> 21:42.390]  What would that kind of smell like?
[21:42.390 --> 21:44.830]  Humaline is common in a lot of sativa strains.
[21:44.830 --> 21:48.230]  And basically in terms of medicinal value,
[21:48.230 --> 21:50.390]  it's anti-tumoral, anti-bacterial,
[21:50.390 --> 21:52.070]  and it has anti-inflammatory properties.
[21:52.070 --> 21:53.830]  And Steep Hill Labs has done a lot of research
[21:53.830 --> 21:55.870]  on individual terpenes and their benefits.
[21:55.870 --> 21:57.270]  That's another place that I've done some research.
[21:57.270 --> 21:58.110]  Shout out to Steep Hill.
[21:58.110 --> 21:59.470]  Yeah, exactly.
[21:59.470 --> 22:00.950]  One thing I can tell you about Humaline,
[22:00.950 --> 22:05.510]  it's also a natural, you don't wanna eat.
[22:05.510 --> 22:08.070]  It's like a diet pill almost.
[22:08.070 --> 22:08.910]  Abiotic suppressant?
[22:08.910 --> 22:09.750]  Yes, that's it.
[22:09.750 --> 22:11.070]  Thank you, brain fart.
[22:11.070 --> 22:13.350]  All right, can you give me a couple more examples?
[22:13.350 --> 22:14.350]  Like maybe one or two more?
[22:14.350 --> 22:15.470]  Because that's really interesting to me.
[22:15.470 --> 22:17.030]  And I'm sure our listeners would love learning
[22:17.030 --> 22:17.870]  about the terpenes as well.
[22:17.870 --> 22:21.430]  BTWs, you can read all of this in THC Magazine.
[22:21.430 --> 22:22.910]  Yes, yes, I'm not trying to make him read
[22:22.910 --> 22:24.550]  his whole magazine, but I wanted to get at least
[22:24.550 --> 22:25.390]  two or three good examples in.
[22:25.390 --> 22:27.630]  No, for sure, just another shout out to THC Magazine.
[22:27.630 --> 22:29.470]  This is a quote from Steep Hill, actually.
[22:29.470 --> 22:30.990]  Linalool is a critical precursor
[22:30.990 --> 22:32.550]  in the formation of vitamin E.
[22:32.550 --> 22:33.550]  It has been used in the treatment
[22:33.550 --> 22:34.950]  of both psychosis and anxiety,
[22:34.950 --> 22:37.950]  and as an anti-epileptic agent.
[22:37.950 --> 22:39.270]  Excuse me.
[22:39.270 --> 22:40.590]  What does that one smell like?
[22:40.590 --> 22:42.630]  Linalool is very floral, like lavender.
[22:42.630 --> 22:45.150]  Okay, all right, that's probably my least favorite terp.
[22:45.150 --> 22:46.950]  I really do not appreciate the smell
[22:46.950 --> 22:48.790]  of lavender and lilacs.
[22:48.790 --> 22:50.470]  It drives my nose crazy.
[22:50.470 --> 22:52.670]  It makes me wanna sneeze and pick my nose for some reason,
[22:52.670 --> 22:53.870]  like there's chunks in my nose.
[22:53.870 --> 22:55.910]  It smells like bathroom stuff,
[22:55.910 --> 22:58.070]  like your grandma's bathroom.
[22:58.070 --> 22:58.910]  Oh, granny, I love you sometimes.
[22:58.910 --> 23:00.710]  My bathroom doesn't smell like that,
[23:00.710 --> 23:03.110]  but it does smell like grandma's bathroom.
[23:03.110 --> 23:03.950]  I went to a restaurant.
[23:03.950 --> 23:05.230]  I wish I could smell your bathroom.
[23:05.230 --> 23:06.070]  That's weird, man.
[23:06.070 --> 23:07.470]  That's really weird.
[23:07.470 --> 23:09.670]  I went to a restaurant, somebody served me rose ice cream,
[23:09.670 --> 23:10.670]  and they asked me what I thought,
[23:10.670 --> 23:12.670]  and I said, it tastes like grandma's bathroom,
[23:12.670 --> 23:14.630]  and they've never eaten rose ice cream again.
[23:14.630 --> 23:15.790]  I ruined that for them.
[23:17.390 --> 23:19.070]  All right, one more terp for me, my friend, please.
[23:19.070 --> 23:20.630]  I guess a common one that everybody loves,
[23:20.630 --> 23:23.390]  D-Limonene, that lemony, really citrusy flavor.
[23:23.390 --> 23:24.230]  Sativa.
[23:24.230 --> 23:25.070]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's my favorite.
[23:25.070 --> 23:26.910]  It's known to be helpful with symptoms
[23:26.910 --> 23:28.270]  of depression and anxiety.
[23:28.670 --> 23:29.950]  Different terpenes are definitely useful
[23:29.950 --> 23:30.870]  for a lot of different things,
[23:30.870 --> 23:32.510]  and we're only really just starting to figure that out.
[23:32.510 --> 23:33.350]  So hopefully-
[23:33.350 --> 23:34.190]  Isn't that why we love it so much?
[23:34.190 --> 23:36.190]  Because it helps us not be anxious
[23:36.190 --> 23:37.670]  and helps us not be depressed?
[23:37.670 --> 23:39.030]  Yeah, that's why a lot of sativa strains
[23:39.030 --> 23:39.870]  are really uplifting.
[23:39.870 --> 23:40.710]  You know what I mean?
[23:40.710 --> 23:41.550]  They help with depression, exactly.
[23:41.550 --> 23:44.030]  That's probably, Brett, what's your favorite terp?
[23:45.790 --> 23:49.630]  I'm gonna have to say limonene, or probably mercine.
[23:49.630 --> 23:50.470]  Okay.
[23:50.470 --> 23:51.710]  Mercine, I like mercine.
[23:51.710 --> 23:53.430]  I like the pinene.
[23:54.390 --> 23:56.110]  I probably go lemonene, too.
[23:56.110 --> 23:56.950]  Okay.
[23:56.950 --> 23:57.790]  I like that lemon, it's all right.
[23:58.710 --> 24:00.510]  Okay, I'm gonna reveal a grow tip
[24:00.510 --> 24:01.590]  that is a million dollar tip
[24:01.590 --> 24:02.830]  that I don't say a lot on the air.
[24:02.830 --> 24:04.350]  I know I've said this one time
[24:04.350 --> 24:05.990]  in a way previous episode. Listen up.
[24:05.990 --> 24:07.110]  If you've got a sativa strain
[24:07.110 --> 24:09.430]  that has lemony flavors and lemon characteristics,
[24:09.430 --> 24:12.550]  and you wanna bring out the D-limonene terpenoids,
[24:12.550 --> 24:14.390]  let it get a little bit too close to the light,
[24:14.390 --> 24:16.870]  and it will panic, and it will start creating D-limonene
[24:16.870 --> 24:18.510]  as a panic response and defense,
[24:18.510 --> 24:20.630]  and that'll bring out your lemony flavors.
[24:20.630 --> 24:21.790]  And I learned this on accident
[24:21.790 --> 24:24.310]  by getting my plants too close to the light too many times,
[24:24.310 --> 24:25.750]  and I'm like, why are they always so lemony?
[24:25.750 --> 24:26.790]  I was like, wait, those are the plants
[24:26.790 --> 24:27.950]  that almost got burnt,
[24:27.950 --> 24:29.830]  and I'm 90% sure that that's what's happening.
[24:29.830 --> 24:31.350]  That's from my experience.
[24:31.350 --> 24:34.230]  I think getting the plants too close to the HPS light
[24:34.230 --> 24:35.350]  will bring out the limonene.
[24:35.350 --> 24:36.190]  So do it on purpose.
[24:36.190 --> 24:37.030]  Drop your lemon Jeffrey,
[24:37.030 --> 24:39.110]  get the light real close to that lemon Jeffrey,
[24:39.110 --> 24:40.710]  and it'll bring it out for you.
[24:40.710 --> 24:43.110]  You're putting the biggest smile on my face right now.
[24:43.110 --> 24:43.950]  You've always got a big smile.
[24:43.950 --> 24:45.870]  We all are smiling.
[24:45.870 --> 24:47.390]  Guys, that was a cool tip.
[24:47.390 --> 24:49.150]  Thank you for sharing that, Rasta Jeff.
[24:49.150 --> 24:50.950]  Devon Granny, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[24:50.950 --> 24:53.230]  You know, it was just,
[24:53.230 --> 24:56.390]  what you just did is the reason I started listening to you.
[24:56.390 --> 25:00.270]  It was your enthusiasm for cannabis.
[25:00.270 --> 25:01.550]  I appreciate that.
[25:01.550 --> 25:03.430]  Can I tell you how I found you?
[25:03.430 --> 25:05.270]  I think through the Traveling Stoner.
[25:05.270 --> 25:06.510]  Well, that's how we got introduced.
[25:06.510 --> 25:07.350]  Thank you, Lindsay.
[25:07.350 --> 25:09.190]  That's how we got in touch.
[25:09.190 --> 25:10.510]  And then we know Brett.
[25:10.510 --> 25:11.350]  We know Brett, yeah.
[25:11.350 --> 25:12.910]  He's the phone snatcher.
[25:12.910 --> 25:14.110]  Yeah, Brett's the real-
[25:14.110 --> 25:18.350]  Have you subscribed THC Sam to the podcast?
[25:18.350 --> 25:20.750]  If he's not listening, I don't know what to do.
[25:20.790 --> 25:23.990]  I might have to go hog time or something.
[25:23.990 --> 25:26.750]  Brett will grab your phone and subscribe you to my podcast.
[25:26.750 --> 25:28.710]  If you've got an iPhone and you're around Brett,
[25:28.710 --> 25:30.230]  you will open up your phone window and you'll be like,
[25:30.230 --> 25:31.830]  when did I subscribe to a podcast?
[25:31.830 --> 25:34.070]  Grab your friend's phone and subscribe them
[25:34.070 --> 25:35.510]  to the Girl From Your Heart podcast.
[25:35.510 --> 25:37.430]  I definitely got a bit of been lacking on the podcast game,
[25:37.430 --> 25:39.030]  so I will be subscribing and following this evening.
[25:39.030 --> 25:40.710]  I can't expect everybody to listen
[25:40.710 --> 25:42.990]  to 140 episodes of me rambling.
[25:42.990 --> 25:43.830]  I can't expect-
[25:43.830 --> 25:45.230]  Why? I'm almost there.
[25:45.230 --> 25:46.070]  You like it when you ramble.
[25:46.070 --> 25:46.910]  I appreciate it.
[25:46.910 --> 25:47.750]  Hashtag you like it when you ramble.
[25:47.750 --> 25:49.230]  Where's your podcast?
[25:49.230 --> 25:54.110]  Hey, guys, by the way, special shout out to Ross DeJeff
[25:54.110 --> 25:56.990]  for this podcast that aired on Monday.
[25:56.990 --> 26:01.670]  I mean, this guy pulled it together and it was like,
[26:01.670 --> 26:04.390]  wow, what a great podcast.
[26:04.390 --> 26:05.910]  You are a pro.
[26:05.910 --> 26:06.750]  Thank you.
[26:06.750 --> 26:07.950]  And what she's referring to, you guys,
[26:07.950 --> 26:11.670]  is so I was gonna put the podcast together Sunday night.
[26:11.670 --> 26:13.190]  I was like, I better throw an intro on that,
[26:13.190 --> 26:14.910]  put the memory card in the computer,
[26:14.910 --> 26:17.270]  put the part that we recorded at the Canyon into a show,
[26:17.270 --> 26:19.430]  and then put an outro on it and post it up.
[26:19.430 --> 26:21.150]  And I pulled out my memory card
[26:21.150 --> 26:23.430]  and it said files are unreadable.
[26:23.430 --> 26:25.230]  So I had to pull a podcast together.
[26:25.230 --> 26:26.470]  It was about eight or nine o'clock
[26:26.470 --> 26:28.150]  and the podcast usually drops at midnight.
[26:28.150 --> 26:30.750]  So I had three or four hours to put together a podcast,
[26:30.750 --> 26:33.870]  record it, edit it up, air it, get it up on the website.
[26:33.870 --> 26:34.710]  And I pulled it off, you guys.
[26:34.710 --> 26:36.350]  It was up there by 1159.
[26:36.350 --> 26:38.550]  So thanks for all the love.
[26:38.550 --> 26:39.390]  I appreciate that.
[26:39.390 --> 26:43.710]  When I got the notification, I was like, is it an encore?
[26:43.750 --> 26:47.350]  And I listened, I was like, wow, kudos.
[26:47.350 --> 26:49.110]  Luckily, I've got some notes prepared for,
[26:49.110 --> 26:51.150]  I try to stay one or two shows in advance.
[26:51.150 --> 26:53.750]  Actually, there's a show that'll come out before this one.
[26:53.750 --> 26:55.310]  148 came out today.
[26:55.310 --> 26:56.150]  This is 150.
[26:56.150 --> 26:58.110]  So I've obviously got one in the can ready to go.
[26:58.110 --> 26:59.630]  So yeah, shout out to my friends
[26:59.630 --> 27:00.990]  that help me record podcasts all the time.
[27:00.990 --> 27:02.110]  I appreciate all of you guys,
[27:02.110 --> 27:03.790]  the guys that are here and not here
[27:03.790 --> 27:05.270]  for taking hours out of their day
[27:05.270 --> 27:07.950]  to come take dabs and record podcasts with me.
[27:07.950 --> 27:09.390]  I appreciate each and every one of you guys.
[27:09.390 --> 27:10.230]  We love it.
[27:10.230 --> 27:11.070]  Thank you so much for the invite.
[27:11.070 --> 27:11.910]  Thank you for having me.
[27:11.910 --> 27:13.510]  It's a tough job.
[27:14.270 --> 27:15.110]  Honestly.
[27:15.110 --> 27:17.550]  But if we have to do it.
[27:17.550 --> 27:18.870]  Is that lollipop medicated?
[27:18.870 --> 27:21.910]  No, I wish it was, but Lindsey's donuts were medicated.
[27:21.910 --> 27:23.270]  So what donut?
[27:23.270 --> 27:24.630]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[27:24.630 --> 27:26.150]  Oh, I know.
[27:26.150 --> 27:27.510]  Well, last time, first of all,
[27:27.510 --> 27:31.910]  I tried to give you a donut last time on the last one.
[27:31.910 --> 27:34.670]  Starfire Edibles, that's those little donuts.
[27:34.670 --> 27:36.670]  And I have to shout out to Starfire Edibles.
[27:36.670 --> 27:41.470]  They are made with solventless hash and they are incredible.
[27:41.510 --> 27:43.670]  She makes amazing different flavors.
[27:43.670 --> 27:45.270]  She makes cake cones.
[27:45.270 --> 27:46.270]  I won't go into it too much,
[27:46.270 --> 27:48.150]  but Starfire Edibles, shout out to them.
[27:48.150 --> 27:48.990]  Shout out, shout out.
[27:48.990 --> 27:49.830]  Sounds like you like it.
[27:49.830 --> 27:50.670]  For sure.
[27:50.670 --> 27:51.510]  Sounds like you like it.
[27:51.510 --> 27:52.350]  That was hard to say.
[27:52.350 --> 27:53.190]  They're my favorite edibles right now, actually.
[27:53.190 --> 27:54.030]  Nice.
[27:54.030 --> 27:54.870]  For sure.
[27:54.870 --> 27:55.710]  All right, I'm afraid of edibles.
[27:55.710 --> 27:56.790]  The people that listen to the podcast
[27:56.790 --> 27:59.110]  know that I ate way too many edibles one time
[27:59.110 --> 28:01.150]  and I've been kind of gun shy since then.
[28:01.150 --> 28:03.590]  All right, I want to go this direction again.
[28:03.590 --> 28:06.230]  I was telling Granny about how I found her.
[28:06.230 --> 28:08.190]  I was scrolling through Facebook one day
[28:08.190 --> 28:09.550]  and there was no sound in the video.
[28:09.550 --> 28:10.590]  So I'm going to cut the sound out,
[28:10.630 --> 28:11.790]  but I was like, check out this lady.
[28:11.790 --> 28:13.950]  And it was just somebody reposting your video.
[28:13.950 --> 28:15.910]  You took a big ass dab,
[28:15.910 --> 28:17.990]  like a dab that I would take probably a half a gram,
[28:17.990 --> 28:20.270]  at least a 0.3, maybe a 0.5.
[28:20.270 --> 28:22.070]  You sucked that dab in, you held it in,
[28:22.070 --> 28:24.590]  you chugged a beer, you chugged a shot,
[28:24.590 --> 28:26.910]  and then you grabbed, you blew out your dab
[28:26.910 --> 28:29.710]  and you grabbed your nectar collector
[28:29.710 --> 28:32.510]  and did another dab and blew that one out
[28:32.510 --> 28:35.230]  and smiled at the camera like nothing had happened.
[28:35.230 --> 28:36.630]  That's kind of what I'm known for.
[28:36.630 --> 28:37.470]  And that's what she does.
[28:37.470 --> 28:40.270]  I guess you should not be proud of it,
[28:40.950 --> 28:43.230]  but I am because really,
[28:43.230 --> 28:46.230]  can you see your mother or your grandma
[28:47.150 --> 28:49.670]  doing a knockout and smiling?
[28:49.670 --> 28:53.710]  And then most people think, oh, she's laid out.
[28:53.710 --> 28:56.790]  I'll come back and do another big dab for you.
[28:56.790 --> 28:59.670]  But she's, we've been, we probably smoked,
[28:59.670 --> 29:01.150]  there's six people here in this group.
[29:01.150 --> 29:02.950]  We probably smoked three or four grams a shatter
[29:02.950 --> 29:04.630]  in the hour that we've been hanging out here.
[29:04.630 --> 29:06.470]  There's been some consumption.
[29:06.470 --> 29:08.310]  And Granny takes a lot of big dabs.
[29:08.310 --> 29:09.150]  She is not shy.
[29:09.150 --> 29:10.110]  She's taken more dabs than me
[29:10.110 --> 29:11.630]  because I feel like I try to keep my throat
[29:11.630 --> 29:13.230]  a little composed for the show.
[29:13.230 --> 29:15.870]  But Granny goes in, she takes some big old dabs.
[29:15.870 --> 29:17.270]  We all have been dabbing out.
[29:17.270 --> 29:20.230]  In fact, everybody needs to watch social media
[29:20.230 --> 29:22.830]  for the best group dab ever.
[29:22.830 --> 29:23.670]  Who's gonna post that?
[29:23.670 --> 29:24.510]  Who's a-
[29:24.510 --> 29:26.630]  I'm gonna post it. He already did, actually.
[29:26.630 --> 29:28.470]  It's about to go up on the THC Magazine account,
[29:28.470 --> 29:29.470]  the hemp connoisseur.
[29:29.470 --> 29:30.430]  Oh, wow, yeah.
[29:30.430 --> 29:32.710]  Make sure you follow the hemp connoisseur account
[29:32.710 --> 29:34.590]  on Instagram so you can see our group dab video.
[29:34.590 --> 29:36.510]  There were six of us doing a big dab
[29:36.510 --> 29:37.950]  over here at the Cana Canyon.
[29:37.950 --> 29:38.990]  It was glorious.
[29:39.830 --> 29:41.150]  It's still very smoky in here.
[29:41.150 --> 29:41.990]  Yeah.
[29:41.990 --> 29:42.830]  It's a little cloudy.
[29:42.830 --> 29:43.950]  They actually cracked the door.
[29:43.950 --> 29:44.790]  Oops.
[29:44.790 --> 29:47.990]  When you smoke out the smoke lounge.
[29:47.990 --> 29:49.990]  I feel like every time they come here,
[29:49.990 --> 29:51.550]  they crack the back door.
[29:51.550 --> 29:52.630]  I take big dabs.
[29:52.630 --> 29:54.830]  They had to clean out their email a couple of times,
[29:54.830 --> 29:56.950]  their rig, because I've globbed it all up.
[29:56.950 --> 29:58.190]  They've been like, who's here globbing?
[29:58.190 --> 29:59.030]  Oh, yeah.
[29:59.030 --> 30:00.630]  Oh, Jess in the corner.
[30:02.630 --> 30:04.230]  Yeah, I take big dabs.
[30:04.230 --> 30:05.550]  So that's how I found Dabbing Granny.
[30:05.550 --> 30:06.870]  It was watching her do strikeouts.
[30:06.870 --> 30:08.510]  And then somebody was like, she lives in Springs.
[30:09.030 --> 30:09.870]  And I was like, what?
[30:09.870 --> 30:11.030]  And then they're like, she shops at Elevate.
[30:11.030 --> 30:11.990]  And I started following you.
[30:11.990 --> 30:13.910]  And I was like, this lady and I cross paths.
[30:13.910 --> 30:15.670]  We go to all the same places.
[30:15.670 --> 30:18.190]  You shop at Green and Healthy Wellness occasionally.
[30:18.190 --> 30:19.630]  You support all the dispensaries in town,
[30:19.630 --> 30:20.870]  which is one thing I love.
[30:20.870 --> 30:22.870]  I love that you don't just go pick one place
[30:22.870 --> 30:23.870]  and say that they're the best.
[30:23.870 --> 30:26.430]  I love that you go and experience all the stuff.
[30:26.430 --> 30:30.670]  I kind of am a representative for the cannabis community.
[30:30.670 --> 30:32.630]  And so I'm gonna go all over.
[30:32.630 --> 30:36.470]  I'm not gonna give one dispensary my plant count
[30:37.470 --> 30:38.910]  because that wouldn't be fair.
[30:38.910 --> 30:40.710]  It wouldn't be fair for somebody to say,
[30:40.710 --> 30:43.310]  oh, we own the Dabbing Granny.
[30:43.310 --> 30:44.750]  I'm a free agent.
[30:44.750 --> 30:47.590]  So I'm gonna kind of tell everybody
[30:47.590 --> 30:48.430]  what we're talking about.
[30:48.430 --> 30:50.430]  In Colorado, if you're a medical marijuana patient,
[30:50.430 --> 30:53.590]  you are allowed to grow a specific amount of plants
[30:53.590 --> 30:56.150]  based on what your doctor feels is appropriate,
[30:56.150 --> 30:58.630]  based on your medical condition,
[30:58.630 --> 31:01.350]  or honestly, based on how much money is in your pocket.
[31:01.350 --> 31:02.990]  It just costs more, honestly.
[31:02.990 --> 31:05.510]  So you pay for an elevated plant count is what we call it.
[31:06.230 --> 31:07.750]  That allows you to grow more plants
[31:07.750 --> 31:09.910]  and also to possess more cannabis.
[31:09.910 --> 31:12.490]  When you go to a dispensary in Colorado Springs,
[31:12.490 --> 31:14.870]  we are medical cannabis only.
[31:14.870 --> 31:17.190]  And the way that those dispensaries are able to grow
[31:17.190 --> 31:19.350]  is those plants that those patients have,
[31:19.350 --> 31:22.630]  they can allow the dispensary to grow those plants for them.
[31:22.630 --> 31:24.230]  We call it signing over your card,
[31:24.230 --> 31:25.790]  signing over your plants.
[31:25.790 --> 31:27.110]  You become a member.
[31:27.110 --> 31:28.350]  So that's what Granny's talking about
[31:28.350 --> 31:30.550]  is she's not gonna let anybody have her plant count.
[31:30.550 --> 31:31.630]  She's in charge of that.
[31:31.630 --> 31:32.790]  She is her own.
[31:32.790 --> 31:33.630]  She's a free agent.
[31:33.630 --> 31:34.470]  She grows on her own.
[31:34.470 --> 31:36.230]  None of these dispensaries own her.
[31:36.230 --> 31:37.110]  They don't have her plants.
[31:37.110 --> 31:38.550]  They can't brag about it.
[31:38.550 --> 31:40.470]  And hopefully Granny's got a nice garden of her own,
[31:40.470 --> 31:43.750]  but that's none of our business unless she wants to tell us.
[31:43.750 --> 31:46.390]  I don't know the first thing about growing.
[31:46.390 --> 31:47.990]  I know a podcast that you can listen to
[31:47.990 --> 31:48.830]  that would probably be-
[31:48.830 --> 31:49.670]  I've been listening.
[31:49.670 --> 31:50.510]  I've been listening.
[31:50.510 --> 31:52.990]  There's a very good podcast that has helped me
[31:52.990 --> 31:55.070]  with a lot of good tips.
[31:55.070 --> 31:55.910]  Episode number one.
[31:55.910 --> 31:57.510]  Give me your phone, I could show you.
[31:57.510 --> 31:58.430]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:58.430 --> 32:02.190]  So what gave you the idea to become the Davin Granny?
[32:03.030 --> 32:06.270]  Well, I've always smoked.
[32:06.270 --> 32:09.750]  I've smoked long before it was legal.
[32:10.830 --> 32:15.830]  And this Davin thing was pretty new
[32:16.110 --> 32:18.870]  about what, maybe two years ago.
[32:18.870 --> 32:21.070]  And at the dispensary I was going to,
[32:21.070 --> 32:22.750]  they kept saying, you need to try this.
[32:22.750 --> 32:24.110]  You need to try this.
[32:24.110 --> 32:27.910]  No, y'all are young boys with slap back hats.
[32:27.910 --> 32:29.110]  I'm not gonna try this.
[32:29.150 --> 32:29.990]  Uh-uh.
[32:31.030 --> 32:32.070]  This is not for me.
[32:32.070 --> 32:32.990]  I'm an old lady.
[32:32.990 --> 32:35.990]  Well, then actually it was the owner
[32:35.990 --> 32:40.190]  of the Canna Canyon, Aaron and Pete.
[32:40.190 --> 32:41.510]  They were like, come on, try it.
[32:41.510 --> 32:43.790]  You have a high tolerance, try it.
[32:45.070 --> 32:48.990]  I tried it, but I wasn't too big on it
[32:48.990 --> 32:50.990]  because I didn't know what I was doing.
[32:51.990 --> 32:54.990]  Then November, I got a portable email.
[32:54.990 --> 32:56.110]  Can I tell that story?
[32:56.110 --> 32:58.230]  You can definitely tell any story you want on this podcast.
[32:58.230 --> 33:01.150]  I'm gonna shout out to Dabato up in Denver
[33:01.150 --> 33:04.950]  because they're the ones that encouraged me
[33:04.950 --> 33:06.430]  to go in front of a camera
[33:06.430 --> 33:08.910]  when I didn't know what the hell I was doing
[33:08.910 --> 33:11.390]  and do dabs and smile and talk.
[33:11.390 --> 33:13.510]  And when I was like, but why should I do it?
[33:13.510 --> 33:16.190]  And they're like, because people will like you.
[33:16.190 --> 33:17.030]  They should.
[33:17.030 --> 33:18.230]  And people like me.
[33:18.230 --> 33:20.150]  I don't know why, but people like me.
[33:20.150 --> 33:21.310]  I love you.
[33:21.310 --> 33:23.790]  You've just got a personality that people wanna watch.
[33:23.790 --> 33:24.630]  I'm gonna take you home tonight.
[33:24.630 --> 33:27.590]  You can take big old dabs and then you can handle it.
[33:27.950 --> 33:30.150]  There's several things that intrigue people,
[33:30.150 --> 33:31.990]  especially the normal people
[33:31.990 --> 33:34.390]  that aren't in Colorado taking dabs.
[33:34.390 --> 33:35.910]  And the people that don't get to dab,
[33:35.910 --> 33:38.150]  the people that when they do take dabs,
[33:38.150 --> 33:40.150]  it's a pea size and they get high as shit
[33:40.150 --> 33:41.390]  because they rarely get to dab.
[33:41.390 --> 33:44.150]  They're blown away by this old lady taking a big old dab.
[33:44.150 --> 33:45.550]  That's like my grandma taking a dab.
[33:45.550 --> 33:47.910]  But now everybody wants to dab.
[33:47.910 --> 33:50.230]  Yeah, and everybody wants to dab with you.
[33:50.230 --> 33:51.070]  Yes.
[33:51.070 --> 33:52.590]  And I guess you keep it quiet that you're coming here
[33:52.590 --> 33:54.270]  because otherwise this place just fills up
[33:54.270 --> 33:55.590]  with people trying to meet granny.
[33:55.590 --> 33:57.550]  I have learned, don't say where I'm going.
[33:58.510 --> 33:59.510]  Actually, speaking to that,
[33:59.510 --> 34:00.910]  in the August issue of the Hub Connoisseur,
[34:00.910 --> 34:02.470]  I had the chance to do an interview
[34:02.470 --> 34:04.150]  with Dabbing Granny over here.
[34:04.150 --> 34:06.550]  And we got to talk about how she started with cannabis
[34:06.550 --> 34:07.870]  and exactly what you just talked about,
[34:07.870 --> 34:10.030]  kind of how she's changing what it looks like
[34:10.030 --> 34:10.990]  to consume hash.
[34:10.990 --> 34:13.590]  And it's changing what it looks like to use a blowtorch,
[34:13.590 --> 34:15.310]  to heat up the nail, to take a big dab.
[34:15.310 --> 34:18.150]  And it also changes what people's opinions look like
[34:18.150 --> 34:19.710]  of what a high tolerance looks like,
[34:19.710 --> 34:22.350]  what actually functioning on that high tolerance looks like.
[34:22.350 --> 34:25.110]  So it's really a cool thing to see.
[34:25.110 --> 34:26.670]  And I think a lot of people are really enjoying it,
[34:26.710 --> 34:28.030]  and it expands her massive following.
[34:28.030 --> 34:29.310]  Massive following.
[34:29.310 --> 34:31.590]  How many Instagram followers do you have now, Granny?
[34:31.590 --> 34:34.350]  I woke up this morning to 151.
[34:34.350 --> 34:36.230]  Woop, woop, woop, woop, woo.
[34:36.230 --> 34:37.070]  Only 151?
[34:37.070 --> 34:39.470]  151, that sucks.
[34:39.470 --> 34:40.310]  And I have not met it.
[34:40.310 --> 34:42.510]  No, dude, she just hit 150 like two days ago.
[34:42.510 --> 34:44.470]  She got a thousand followers in like a day.
[34:44.470 --> 34:45.790]  She only got 151?
[34:45.790 --> 34:46.630]  Stack it.
[34:46.630 --> 34:51.630]  Wait, you're telling me she only has 150 people.
[34:51.710 --> 34:52.550]  No, I'm joking.
[34:52.550 --> 34:55.430]  Granny, she deserves way more, but like still.
[34:55.430 --> 34:56.590]  You have to add the K to the end.
[34:56.590 --> 34:57.790]  People don't understand that.
[34:57.790 --> 35:00.230]  I have 151,000 followers.
[35:00.230 --> 35:01.390]  Yeah, there you go.
[35:01.390 --> 35:02.830]  See, I was trying to iterate.
[35:02.830 --> 35:04.270]  Can I tell you guys a funny story
[35:04.270 --> 35:06.150]  about a dab lounge last night?
[35:06.150 --> 35:08.030]  Some of our followers might not know,
[35:08.030 --> 35:12.030]  and if you just say 151, they might just think,
[35:12.030 --> 35:12.870]  they're not understanding.
[35:12.870 --> 35:13.710]  That's not a big following, you rip.
[35:13.710 --> 35:16.870]  And I haven't even been on social media a year.
[35:16.870 --> 35:17.870]  But last night.
[35:17.870 --> 35:20.990]  151,000 followers in one year, Granny.
[35:20.990 --> 35:22.070]  I know, it's amazing.
[35:22.070 --> 35:22.910]  It's crazy.
[35:22.910 --> 35:25.390]  And then look, I'm on Periscope.
[35:26.230 --> 35:27.070]  Snapchat.
[35:27.070 --> 35:28.110]  All you do is.
[35:28.110 --> 35:28.950]  Talk.
[35:28.950 --> 35:29.790]  And dab.
[35:29.790 --> 35:31.150]  And do just what we're doing here.
[35:31.150 --> 35:31.990]  I love it.
[35:31.990 --> 35:34.550]  But you know the best thing about being Dab and Granny?
[35:34.550 --> 35:35.390]  What?
[35:35.390 --> 35:36.230]  This right here.
[35:36.230 --> 35:39.750]  Look how many young people I have brought together tonight.
[35:41.070 --> 35:41.910]  And now I'm here.
[35:41.910 --> 35:44.150]  And have exchanged a conversation.
[35:44.150 --> 35:44.990]  I met Sam tonight.
[35:44.990 --> 35:45.830]  Good to meet you.
[35:45.830 --> 35:48.830]  Guys, it's not all about getting stoned.
[35:48.830 --> 35:50.030]  Please don't think it is.
[35:50.030 --> 35:52.110]  Yes, we're giggling and stuff, but no.
[35:52.110 --> 35:52.950]  It's pretty good.
[35:52.950 --> 35:53.790]  It's pretty good.
[35:53.790 --> 35:54.630]  It's pretty good.
[35:54.910 --> 35:55.750]  It's education.
[35:55.750 --> 35:58.270]  There's so much going on.
[35:58.270 --> 35:59.870]  I think we might have heard you, Chris.
[35:59.870 --> 36:00.830]  Yeah, maybe.
[36:00.830 --> 36:01.750]  No, you guys are cool over there.
[36:01.750 --> 36:03.110]  Everyone's so relaxed in this place.
[36:03.110 --> 36:04.790]  Everyone's just on the couches, just chilling.
[36:04.790 --> 36:05.990]  I love the vibe in here right now.
[36:05.990 --> 36:07.870]  There's some revolution playing in the background.
[36:07.870 --> 36:10.510]  It's kind of hard not to after, you know, two dozen dabs.
[36:10.510 --> 36:12.830]  Yeah, everyone's just kicking it.
[36:12.830 --> 36:14.150]  Granny, we cut you off on your story.
[36:14.150 --> 36:14.990]  I apologize.
[36:14.990 --> 36:16.390]  Oh yes.
[36:16.390 --> 36:17.750]  I needed butane.
[36:18.790 --> 36:21.550]  What dabber doesn't need butane?
[36:21.550 --> 36:25.190]  Not to blast dabs, but for my torches.
[36:25.190 --> 36:27.790]  So I was on Hancock and Delta,
[36:28.710 --> 36:32.590]  and I seen Rasta colors, and it said,
[36:32.590 --> 36:35.430]  hops, crops, gift shop.
[36:36.310 --> 36:37.510]  No red card needed.
[36:38.390 --> 36:40.350]  Okay, they'll sell butane, right?
[36:40.350 --> 36:41.190]  Yep.
[36:41.190 --> 36:43.830]  I walk in the door, and there's somebody on a couch,
[36:43.830 --> 36:46.270]  and it's not the Canna Canyon vibe.
[36:46.270 --> 36:49.910]  It's more like dab lounge, family joint kind of vibe.
[36:49.950 --> 36:53.350]  You know, bar room kind of vibe.
[36:53.350 --> 36:56.710]  And a person on the couch goes, you look familiar.
[36:56.710 --> 36:58.750]  And I said, yeah, I'm the dabbing granny.
[37:00.150 --> 37:03.070]  And I wasn't tooting my horn or anything.
[37:03.070 --> 37:04.870]  So I said, do you have butane?
[37:04.870 --> 37:06.630]  And the girl goes, yeah.
[37:06.630 --> 37:08.790]  And she was kind of attitude with me.
[37:09.830 --> 37:13.670]  And she said, if I turn you on to a dab, can I record it?
[37:13.670 --> 37:15.390]  And I said, sure, I don't care.
[37:17.070 --> 37:19.790]  So she's recording, and she goes,
[37:20.670 --> 37:21.630]  she says she's famous.
[37:21.630 --> 37:23.830]  I hope it was worth the wait.
[37:25.110 --> 37:27.950]  She dabs me, doesn't carve it,
[37:27.950 --> 37:31.670]  and lifts the damn joint off the pipe.
[37:31.670 --> 37:33.590]  And I just go, peace.
[37:33.590 --> 37:35.950]  You're not supposed to carve a nail.
[37:35.950 --> 37:39.670]  No, you just lift the drop down right off the nail, right?
[37:39.670 --> 37:40.710]  That's just weird.
[37:40.710 --> 37:42.310]  It was very weird.
[37:42.310 --> 37:43.950]  They didn't like me there.
[37:44.790 --> 37:46.190]  Why, what did you do to them, Granny?
[37:46.190 --> 37:47.030]  I don't know.
[37:47.030 --> 37:48.710]  She says she's famous.
[37:48.710 --> 37:51.270]  I'm like, well, I didn't say I was famous.
[37:51.270 --> 37:53.270]  I said I was the dabbing granny.
[37:53.270 --> 37:55.470]  Yeah, rude people.
[37:55.470 --> 37:57.790]  Don't be rude to people, especially the dabbing granny.
[37:57.790 --> 37:59.110]  She's a dabbing granny.
[37:59.110 --> 37:59.950]  She's a sweetheart.
[37:59.950 --> 38:02.190]  Well, then somebody made a comment.
[38:02.190 --> 38:03.350]  Granny, don't go there.
[38:03.350 --> 38:06.710]  Somebody was just killed in the parking lot there last week.
[38:08.790 --> 38:09.990]  All right, then.
[38:09.990 --> 38:11.190]  Shout out to the Cannon Canyon.
[38:11.190 --> 38:12.550]  Nobody has been killed here.
[38:12.550 --> 38:13.630]  No. Ever.
[38:13.630 --> 38:17.310]  How can you hate on a sweet lady
[38:17.350 --> 38:19.550]  who brings a basket of awesome treats
[38:19.550 --> 38:20.390]  everywhere she comes with her?
[38:20.390 --> 38:21.990]  She's got a basket of snacks over there.
[38:21.990 --> 38:24.430]  Not only does she bring a basket of turfs,
[38:24.430 --> 38:29.070]  she literally brings a basket of all candy greatness
[38:29.070 --> 38:30.910]  you could possibly think of.
[38:30.910 --> 38:31.750]  Wait, there's candy?
[38:31.750 --> 38:32.590]  Can I have some?
[38:32.590 --> 38:33.910]  Is that what you're saying?
[38:33.910 --> 38:35.350]  Granny said there's always candy.
[38:35.350 --> 38:37.550]  That is Granny's basket right there of goodness.
[38:37.550 --> 38:38.390]  Goodness.
[38:38.390 --> 38:41.110]  She brought a basket of snacks.
[38:41.110 --> 38:44.110]  Those were hard words for my brain to make happen, dude.
[38:44.110 --> 38:44.950]  Basket of snacks.
[38:44.950 --> 38:46.070]  Are you good on a lollipop?
[38:46.070 --> 38:47.590]  I'm good on a lollipop.
[38:48.870 --> 38:49.710]  I appreciate you though.
[38:49.710 --> 38:51.470]  You're my Granny.
[38:51.470 --> 38:52.310]  You confused him.
[38:52.310 --> 38:54.150]  You really are my Granny.
[38:55.870 --> 38:56.710]  It's amazing.
[38:56.710 --> 38:58.230]  I'll eat some sugar, baby.
[38:58.230 --> 38:59.550]  I'll take one.
[38:59.550 --> 39:01.590]  How nostalgic are sugar babies?
[39:01.590 --> 39:03.590]  Shout out to Lindsey for bringing people snacks
[39:03.590 --> 39:04.470]  and being awesome.
[39:04.470 --> 39:06.550]  Shout out to Granny for bringing a basket of snacks.
[39:06.550 --> 39:08.550]  I don't think I've ever used a sugar baby,
[39:08.550 --> 39:10.830]  but I'm gonna try it because I need some sugar, baby.
[39:10.830 --> 39:13.350]  Shout out to Chris for getting me this shirt, actually.
[39:13.390 --> 39:16.230]  Chris has good taste.
[39:16.230 --> 39:17.510]  Well, obviously.
[39:21.510 --> 39:22.510]  Lindsey's blushing.
[39:22.510 --> 39:24.070]  I never get to see Lindsey blush.
[39:24.070 --> 39:24.910]  That's great.
[39:24.910 --> 39:25.990]  I think she's blushing because what I said
[39:25.990 --> 39:27.590]  and no one else caught.
[39:27.590 --> 39:28.630]  Uh-oh.
[39:28.630 --> 39:31.470]  I actually really wanted to blush that day in the car
[39:31.470 --> 39:32.790]  with the...
[39:32.790 --> 39:34.350]  All right, we're gonna move forward now.
[39:34.350 --> 39:37.110]  Oh, we've got Daven Granny here on the podcast with us.
[39:40.190 --> 39:42.310]  Jeff is blushing.
[39:42.310 --> 39:44.350]  Jeff is as red as his beard.
[39:44.350 --> 39:46.630]  I just wanted to watch him do that back.
[39:46.630 --> 39:47.950]  You see that?
[39:47.950 --> 39:50.670]  Good one, trolling Lindsey.
[39:50.670 --> 39:51.510]  I know.
[39:51.510 --> 39:52.350]  I have no doubt.
[39:52.350 --> 39:54.030]  I wouldn't know Dad needed face red.
[39:54.030 --> 39:54.870]  It's beautiful.
[39:54.870 --> 39:56.270]  So these sugar babies, these are the ones.
[39:56.270 --> 39:57.430]  Oh, he's trying to switch it.
[39:57.430 --> 40:00.430]  I can't believe what's going on here, actually.
[40:00.430 --> 40:02.870]  I am so excited right now.
[40:02.870 --> 40:04.550]  Oh, you shouldn't eat these while you try to talk.
[40:04.550 --> 40:06.150]  You can't chew with those in your face at all.
[40:06.150 --> 40:07.230]  That's gonna be weird.
[40:07.230 --> 40:08.070]  All right.
[40:08.590 --> 40:12.510]  So I'm gonna let him try to chew these real quick
[40:12.510 --> 40:14.590]  while I stare down at Jeff
[40:14.590 --> 40:18.910]  and wanna know what this whole conversation is about
[40:18.910 --> 40:23.190]  because I know Lindsey over there is giggling like no other.
[40:23.190 --> 40:25.190]  The conversation that happened in the car?
[40:25.190 --> 40:27.110]  Oh, inside joke.
[40:27.110 --> 40:28.150]  It's about the car.
[40:29.150 --> 40:30.270]  What happens when the car stays in the car?
[40:30.270 --> 40:32.350]  My car has now became Vegas.
[40:32.350 --> 40:33.670]  We're gonna name my car Vegas.
[40:33.670 --> 40:35.190]  We're gonna name my car Vegas.
[40:35.230 --> 40:38.670]  I was honestly just trying to make you blush back
[40:38.670 --> 40:39.710]  just because-
[40:39.710 --> 40:41.430]  We did experience one thing in the car though.
[40:41.430 --> 40:44.430]  I don't like it when the person in the seat behind me
[40:44.430 --> 40:46.430]  tries to use a dab torch
[40:46.430 --> 40:48.470]  because I've got like four foot long dreadlocks
[40:48.470 --> 40:51.350]  and that freaked me the fuck out completely.
[40:51.350 --> 40:53.870]  So that's funny because then on the last podcast
[40:53.870 --> 40:56.470]  when someone was sitting behind me on the couch
[40:56.470 --> 40:57.910]  and they were using a torch and I looked at you
[40:57.910 --> 40:58.870]  and I was like, okay, you're right.
[40:58.870 --> 40:59.710]  That's weird.
[40:59.710 --> 41:00.550]  I don't like that.
[41:00.550 --> 41:01.710]  You're like, ooh, I could just be the candle
[41:01.710 --> 41:02.550]  in a minute here.
[41:02.550 --> 41:03.390]  This is weird.
[41:03.390 --> 41:04.230]  Yeah, I was like, where are my dreads down?
[41:04.390 --> 41:06.030]  Is there one of them loose?
[41:06.030 --> 41:07.470]  Do I have all of them still?
[41:09.190 --> 41:10.110]  I don't smell burning hair.
[41:10.110 --> 41:10.950]  We're okay.
[41:10.950 --> 41:11.790]  I think we're good.
[41:11.790 --> 41:13.950]  Wow, right now we have three dreads
[41:13.950 --> 41:15.630]  to three non-dreads right here.
[41:15.630 --> 41:16.510]  And Camille's over there.
[41:16.510 --> 41:17.350]  So that's-
[41:17.350 --> 41:18.190]  Holy shit.
[41:18.190 --> 41:19.030]  And Camille's over there.
[41:19.030 --> 41:20.150]  We're over, we're on.
[41:20.150 --> 41:21.070]  Team dreadlocks.
[41:21.070 --> 41:21.910]  Team dreadlocks.
[41:21.910 --> 41:23.110]  Oh my mind.
[41:23.110 --> 41:24.670]  Might have to convert.
[41:24.670 --> 41:25.510]  Might have to convert.
[41:25.510 --> 41:26.670]  Granny, what are you doing right now?
[41:26.670 --> 41:28.390]  Would you like to explain what's happening to us?
[41:28.390 --> 41:30.350]  Sam, will you hold the mic to her face so that she can-
[41:30.350 --> 41:32.110]  I am terping up.
[41:32.110 --> 41:33.910]  I have some Viola.
[41:34.750 --> 41:35.710]  I don't even know what it is.
[41:35.710 --> 41:37.310]  It's some Viola shatter.
[41:37.310 --> 41:38.630]  I like the paper.
[41:38.630 --> 41:39.470]  What's the other thing in your hand though?
[41:39.470 --> 41:41.190]  And that comes from Oil Slick, by the way.
[41:41.190 --> 41:42.750]  That's how I got to know Oil Slick
[41:42.750 --> 41:45.870]  because I admired this beautiful shatter paper.
[41:45.870 --> 41:47.110]  Shout out to my friends at Oil Slick.
[41:47.110 --> 41:48.310]  Those are good friends of mine.
[41:48.310 --> 41:49.830]  Shout out to Josh and the entire Oil Slick.
[41:49.830 --> 41:50.670]  I love you guys.
[41:50.670 --> 41:51.510]  I love Josh's mustache.
[41:51.510 --> 41:52.350]  He's a really cool dude.
[41:52.350 --> 41:54.830]  Yeah, the coolest mustache you'll ever find.
[41:54.830 --> 41:56.430]  Anyway, so I got to know him
[41:56.430 --> 41:57.670]  because of the parchment paper.
[41:57.670 --> 42:01.550]  Anyway, so some Viola, which needs to be kicked up a notch.
[42:01.550 --> 42:04.070]  It's not real flavorful.
[42:04.910 --> 42:09.150]  So our good friend, the Terp Pimp, has some Durban Poison.
[42:09.150 --> 42:11.190]  I'm going to add some of this.
[42:11.190 --> 42:13.030]  That's like my second or third favorite right there.
[42:13.030 --> 42:13.870]  The Durban Poison.
[42:13.870 --> 42:14.990]  Oh, I love Durban Poison.
[42:14.990 --> 42:16.830]  It's so distinguishable.
[42:16.830 --> 42:18.710]  It's one of my favorite flowers to smoke.
[42:18.710 --> 42:19.550]  Exactly, that's why.
[42:19.550 --> 42:22.590]  But honestly, I don't enjoy the Terps.
[42:22.590 --> 42:23.430]  Really?
[42:23.430 --> 42:24.270]  Oddly enough.
[42:24.270 --> 42:27.470]  It hits my tongue where it's overpowering to my tongue.
[42:27.470 --> 42:31.310]  What was the combination you had last week that you was-
[42:31.310 --> 42:33.510]  It was the Durban Poison on some shatter.
[42:33.550 --> 42:35.270]  I don't remember what the shatter was,
[42:35.270 --> 42:37.270]  but there's that licorice anise flavor.
[42:37.270 --> 42:39.470]  It's too overpowering within the Terps.
[42:39.470 --> 42:40.950]  The flowers are amazing.
[42:40.950 --> 42:45.190]  I love the Lemon G, the Ghost Train Haze, the OG Kush,
[42:45.190 --> 42:48.830]  the Paradigm, the whatever, there's a berry with Zenberry.
[42:48.830 --> 42:49.670]  I like that whole mixture.
[42:49.670 --> 42:50.510]  Zenberry's out of control.
[42:50.510 --> 42:51.870]  The other ones you brought last week,
[42:51.870 --> 42:53.150]  the ones you brought to Secret Sesh,
[42:53.150 --> 42:54.510]  loved every one of them.
[42:54.510 --> 42:56.790]  The Durban Poison, my tongue doesn't agree with it.
[42:56.790 --> 42:58.110]  Oh, Secret Sesh.
[42:59.390 --> 43:00.430]  Secret Sesh.
[43:00.430 --> 43:01.910]  No, the Durban Poison and then there's-
[43:02.030 --> 43:03.270]  I don't know what time this podcast comes out.
[43:03.270 --> 43:05.350]  I will have never heard.
[43:05.350 --> 43:06.190]  Will it happen, you mean?
[43:06.190 --> 43:07.830]  Yeah, sorry, I was trying to go quickly
[43:07.830 --> 43:08.670]  so that Bright could talk.
[43:08.670 --> 43:09.510]  Sorry.
[43:09.510 --> 43:10.350]  I was trying to cut myself off.
[43:10.350 --> 43:12.070]  I was trying to get in there quick.
[43:12.070 --> 43:13.270]  But I wanted to say it first.
[43:13.270 --> 43:14.110]  Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[43:14.110 --> 43:15.430]  I just wanted to get in there first.
[43:15.430 --> 43:18.390]  But shout out to Secret Sesh.
[43:20.030 --> 43:22.350]  No, that's why I'm kind of having issues over here.
[43:22.350 --> 43:23.990]  I'm like, which one do I talk into?
[43:23.990 --> 43:25.710]  So Granny is now taking a dab.
[43:25.710 --> 43:27.270]  She's got a healthy size dab there.
[43:27.270 --> 43:30.070]  That's gotta be, that's a good dab.
[43:30.070 --> 43:31.790]  That's .2, .25.
[43:32.670 --> 43:33.510]  And they're gonna drop the turps.
[43:33.510 --> 43:35.870]  She's got a little, are you just gonna pour it on?
[43:35.870 --> 43:37.350]  Oh, I'm impressed.
[43:37.350 --> 43:38.190]  Just ballsy.
[43:38.190 --> 43:40.550]  Sam's got a little, a small dram vial,
[43:40.550 --> 43:42.910]  like a quarter dram vial of turpines.
[43:42.910 --> 43:45.790]  And he just poured the turps directly onto the dab
[43:45.790 --> 43:47.950]  and he nailed it like a freaking Olympian.
[43:47.950 --> 43:49.070]  That's gorgeous.
[43:49.070 --> 43:49.910]  That is a beautiful dab.
[43:49.910 --> 43:52.270]  He would get a tan in the dab moment.
[43:52.270 --> 43:53.790]  You don't like the Durban Poison?
[43:53.790 --> 43:55.230]  It's just not my favorite.
[43:55.230 --> 44:00.230]  I'm gonna try to bring the Clear Durban Poison.
[44:01.150 --> 44:02.390]  I'm not mad at you for anything.
[44:02.390 --> 44:03.630]  Don't hate me.
[44:03.630 --> 44:04.470]  There's never hate.
[44:04.470 --> 44:07.750]  Yeah, it's just, you know, it's not my flavor.
[44:07.750 --> 44:09.150]  Oh, Granny grabbed the e-nail.
[44:09.150 --> 44:09.990]  The thing is milky.
[44:09.990 --> 44:10.830]  She's capping it.
[44:10.830 --> 44:12.150]  She's like a champion over here.
[44:12.150 --> 44:13.190]  What?
[44:13.190 --> 44:14.950]  This is when you need the video.
[44:14.950 --> 44:16.550]  Oh, holy shit.
[44:16.550 --> 44:17.670]  You should have saw that claw
[44:17.670 --> 44:18.950]  that just came out of her mouth.
[44:18.950 --> 44:20.430]  Yeah, you should have just heard that.
[44:20.430 --> 44:21.270]  Oh, I was out of here.
[44:21.270 --> 44:22.430]  She shakes her head.
[44:22.430 --> 44:23.910]  She's like, no, no, no, no, no.
[44:23.910 --> 44:25.110]  She points at her nose.
[44:25.110 --> 44:26.630]  She's like, no, that didn't go out of my mouth.
[44:26.630 --> 44:27.750]  That came out right out of my nose.
[44:27.750 --> 44:28.590]  Holy shit.
[44:28.590 --> 44:30.070]  Most people would be coughing by now.
[44:30.910 --> 44:32.870]  I would say that would have burned my nose.
[44:32.870 --> 44:34.310]  She said she has tears in her eyes.
[44:34.310 --> 44:36.550]  But yum.
[44:37.630 --> 44:38.990]  Tears of yum.
[44:38.990 --> 44:39.910]  Yes, tears of yum.
[44:39.910 --> 44:40.750]  Tears of terps.
[44:40.750 --> 44:41.790]  Terp tears.
[44:41.790 --> 44:42.870]  Hashtag terp tears.
[44:42.870 --> 44:44.270]  Oh, that might be a new one.
[44:44.270 --> 44:45.110]  Yeah.
[44:45.110 --> 44:45.950]  Terp tears.
[44:45.950 --> 44:46.790]  That was probably like a .3 dab.
[44:46.790 --> 44:48.750]  I want to ask Granny how long she's been consuming cannabis
[44:48.750 --> 44:51.830]  as soon as she quits choking on this mini dab.
[44:51.830 --> 44:53.230]  Since she was 14.
[44:53.230 --> 44:54.670]  Did she say 14?
[44:54.670 --> 44:57.670]  But keep in mind, that podcast never happened.
[44:57.670 --> 44:59.150]  No, I'm telling you since she was 14.
[44:59.150 --> 44:59.990]  I think I know that actually.
[44:59.990 --> 45:00.830]  It is.
[45:00.830 --> 45:01.870]  It's, Lindsay is correct.
[45:01.870 --> 45:02.710]  Killing it.
[45:02.710 --> 45:04.110]  A freshman in high school.
[45:04.110 --> 45:05.430]  Come on, I know Granny trivia.
[45:05.430 --> 45:06.270]  Let's do this.
[45:06.270 --> 45:07.110]  You want sugar, baby?
[45:07.110 --> 45:08.110]  No, I'm good.
[45:08.110 --> 45:09.310]  I'm just kidding.
[45:09.310 --> 45:12.590]  That's how some of my giveaways are, trivia like that.
[45:12.590 --> 45:13.430]  When did I?
[45:13.430 --> 45:15.550]  No, I think we actually just had that conversation
[45:15.550 --> 45:18.470]  when you were at the shop last.
[45:18.470 --> 45:19.310]  Probably.
[45:19.310 --> 45:20.150]  I think that was.
[45:20.150 --> 45:20.990]  Why?
[45:20.990 --> 45:22.750]  Oh, I met another nice glass blower.
[45:22.750 --> 45:23.910]  Let's shout him out.
[45:24.870 --> 45:26.350]  Mr. Bojangles.
[45:26.350 --> 45:27.270]  Oh, yes.
[45:27.270 --> 45:28.550]  That dude deserves a shout out.
[45:29.390 --> 45:32.150]  Yes, Logan and Cody.
[45:32.150 --> 45:33.430]  Yes, Cloudy Glass.
[45:33.430 --> 45:35.190]  They do a lot of Periscopes.
[45:35.190 --> 45:36.990]  If you follow them on Periscope,
[45:36.990 --> 45:39.190]  you'll see them blowing some glass.
[45:39.190 --> 45:40.030]  Honestly.
[45:40.030 --> 45:42.390]  They're my number one alert, those guys on Periscope.
[45:42.390 --> 45:44.830]  They actually depend on their Periscope
[45:44.830 --> 45:46.110]  to sell their artwork.
[45:46.110 --> 45:47.790]  So give them a follow.
[45:47.790 --> 45:48.630]  Yes, they do.
[45:48.630 --> 45:50.230]  I love how social media,
[45:50.230 --> 45:52.430]  I'm sure Granny makes a decent income
[45:52.430 --> 45:53.430]  off of the social media,
[45:53.430 --> 45:56.190]  whether it be glass or clothing or whatever is sent to you.
[45:56.190 --> 45:57.030]  I'm sure you get.
[45:57.030 --> 45:57.870]  Oh, yes.
[45:58.190 --> 45:59.630]  A mailbox full of stuff every month.
[45:59.630 --> 46:01.230]  And Lindsay, I know you do a whole bunch
[46:01.230 --> 46:02.670]  of social media stuff.
[46:02.670 --> 46:03.510]  Yeah.
[46:03.510 --> 46:05.510]  And Chris and I met through social media.
[46:05.510 --> 46:06.870]  That's how everything happened.
[46:06.870 --> 46:09.310]  That's how I became friends with Bobo Blaster Co.
[46:09.310 --> 46:10.590]  Remember I used to say on the podcast
[46:10.590 --> 46:11.790]  and you said you would giggle.
[46:11.790 --> 46:12.630]  No, on Periscope.
[46:12.630 --> 46:14.070]  Brett, I'm pretty sure we became friends on social media
[46:14.070 --> 46:15.110]  before we ever met.
[46:16.190 --> 46:18.470]  Definitely, actually, I've been following you.
[46:18.470 --> 46:19.470]  I've loved the podcast.
[46:19.470 --> 46:21.150]  Love what you've been putting out for a while.
[46:21.150 --> 46:21.990]  Well, thank you, bro.
[46:21.990 --> 46:23.590]  But social media brought us all together.
[46:23.590 --> 46:24.790]  I'm gonna shout Brett out
[46:24.790 --> 46:26.830]  for being such a kind, loving person
[46:26.830 --> 46:28.230]  in the cannabis community.
[46:28.230 --> 46:29.070]  Thank you.
[46:29.070 --> 46:31.150]  When I jumped on the scene back in November,
[46:31.150 --> 46:32.630]  I didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[46:32.630 --> 46:34.790]  And none of you, in fact, most people were like,
[46:34.790 --> 46:37.870]  where the hell did this woman come from?
[46:37.870 --> 46:41.670]  I still have this note that Brett wrote me
[46:41.670 --> 46:45.230]  with one of his first slaps, as the people call them,
[46:45.230 --> 46:47.670]  because you slap them up on everything,
[46:47.670 --> 46:50.430]  his light bulb, Mary's motivation,
[46:50.430 --> 46:53.710]  that just encouraged me to keep being positive and silly.
[46:53.710 --> 46:55.750]  And I have.
[46:55.750 --> 46:58.710]  So thank you, Brett, just for kind of saying, you know,
[46:58.710 --> 47:00.030]  stick with it.
[47:00.030 --> 47:01.430]  And I took a picture,
[47:01.430 --> 47:02.870]  cause I don't think he believed
[47:02.870 --> 47:06.190]  that I really kept that letter for that long, but I have.
[47:06.190 --> 47:07.390]  This is what I'm talking about.
[47:07.390 --> 47:08.830]  This is why I love Brett so much.
[47:08.830 --> 47:11.950]  This is how positive and just happy you always are.
[47:11.950 --> 47:14.110]  And every time I see you, you're never upset.
[47:14.110 --> 47:15.590]  You just, all right, let's do this.
[47:15.590 --> 47:17.110]  Let's say, here's Terps, let's do this.
[47:17.110 --> 47:20.070]  I'm so positive all the time.
[47:20.070 --> 47:22.350]  His Instagram displays exactly that.
[47:22.350 --> 47:24.830]  Guys, follow, is it Mary's underscore motivation
[47:24.830 --> 47:26.310]  or Mary's motivation?
[47:26.310 --> 47:27.470]  Mary's underscore motivation.
[47:27.470 --> 47:29.230]  All right, follow Mary's underscore motivation
[47:29.230 --> 47:30.070]  on Instagram.
[47:30.070 --> 47:30.910]  Check him out in the morning.
[47:30.910 --> 47:31.750]  He takes a morning dab.
[47:31.750 --> 47:32.790]  He does a silly dance.
[47:32.790 --> 47:33.630]  He's got a dog.
[47:34.670 --> 47:36.950]  He can do handstand dabs.
[47:36.950 --> 47:37.790]  Thank you.
[47:37.790 --> 47:39.750]  I was just about to say to you, listen,
[47:39.750 --> 47:42.030]  I tried three times, okay?
[47:42.030 --> 47:45.070]  I just don't have a rig that will like,
[47:45.070 --> 47:46.710]  yours right to your mouth.
[47:46.710 --> 47:48.030]  What the hell is that?
[47:48.030 --> 47:49.070]  That was so perfect.
[47:49.070 --> 47:50.590]  I was like, dude, I'm never gonna be able to do that.
[47:50.590 --> 47:52.750]  I don't have a rig that's, it was just perfect height.
[47:52.750 --> 47:53.590]  I was like, I hate you.
[47:53.590 --> 47:55.030]  I have tried many times.
[47:55.030 --> 47:56.710]  The rig honestly is what did it.
[47:56.710 --> 47:58.830]  I was just looking at, I was stoned looking at the rig
[47:58.830 --> 48:00.990]  and I was like, how can I take a funny dab?
[48:00.990 --> 48:03.030]  And I looked at my Bob Marley poster on the wall,
[48:03.030 --> 48:04.670]  or tapestry on the wall, and I'm like,
[48:04.670 --> 48:07.070]  well, my rig kind of curves.
[48:07.070 --> 48:09.110]  Maybe I could do a headstand and it'll reach right
[48:09.110 --> 48:11.590]  in my mouth and honestly, a first try,
[48:11.590 --> 48:14.110]  I was like, honestly tried my first try and it worked.
[48:14.110 --> 48:14.950]  I was surprised as fuck.
[48:14.950 --> 48:15.990]  This is what happens when you think outside the box
[48:15.990 --> 48:17.670]  and do too many dabs.
[48:17.670 --> 48:18.910]  I have tried, Brett.
[48:18.910 --> 48:20.190]  I'm not gonna lie.
[48:20.190 --> 48:24.470]  But my ass will not pop up over my head.
[48:24.470 --> 48:27.630]  So I asked grumpy grandpa, will you give me a lift?
[48:27.630 --> 48:32.190]  And he said, you are not one of those 25 year old kids.
[48:32.190 --> 48:35.510]  No, I will not help you do a handstand dab.
[48:35.510 --> 48:38.190]  Can I help you do a handstand dab before we leave tonight?
[48:38.190 --> 48:40.270]  Can we put some of these couch cushions on the floor
[48:40.270 --> 48:41.110]  before all this happens?
[48:41.110 --> 48:41.950]  Yes, let's do it.
[48:41.950 --> 48:44.670]  Can we sign some waivers to our roster, Jeff?
[48:44.670 --> 48:46.390]  This is literally the keg stand of the dab world.
[48:46.390 --> 48:47.230]  That's what this is right now.
[48:47.230 --> 48:48.070]  Yeah, that's fine.
[48:48.070 --> 48:49.390]  That's fine.
[48:49.390 --> 48:51.750]  The dab stand.
[48:51.750 --> 48:54.110]  The dab stand, holy crap.
[48:54.110 --> 48:56.350]  I would love to see it, but I'm afraid to see it.
[48:56.350 --> 48:59.030]  So I wanna back up on two things.
[48:59.030 --> 49:01.510]  Grumpy grandpa?
[49:01.510 --> 49:02.350]  Yes.
[49:02.350 --> 49:04.110]  I fucking love it.
[49:04.110 --> 49:04.950]  Dabbing grandpa.
[49:04.950 --> 49:07.150]  Okay, now I'll tell you,
[49:07.150 --> 49:10.150]  when I first started doing dabbing granny,
[49:10.150 --> 49:13.190]  I have to blow my nose, dab, you know.
[49:13.190 --> 49:14.670]  All right, I'll talk for a second.
[49:14.670 --> 49:18.190]  I'm in love with the grumpy grandpa that's the best.
[49:18.230 --> 49:20.150]  He was like, have fun,
[49:20.150 --> 49:22.310]  but I don't want to be on the camera.
[49:22.310 --> 49:23.590]  And I respected that.
[49:23.590 --> 49:25.590]  And I was like, well,
[49:25.590 --> 49:30.590]  what do you want people to know you as?
[49:30.950 --> 49:34.390]  And he was like, well, just call me grumpy grandpa.
[49:34.390 --> 49:37.030]  And I was like, okay, that it is.
[49:37.030 --> 49:38.430]  That's great.
[49:38.430 --> 49:39.270]  It's perfect.
[49:39.270 --> 49:41.550]  On a scale of one to 10, how grumpy is grandpa?
[49:42.790 --> 49:45.150]  Actually, because he has such chronic pain
[49:45.150 --> 49:46.590]  and chronic illness.
[49:46.590 --> 49:49.070]  Some days he's pretty grumpy.
[49:49.070 --> 49:50.470]  He could be an 11.
[49:50.470 --> 49:55.470]  But considering I've been with him since 1974
[49:56.590 --> 49:58.670]  and he still makes me laugh every day.
[49:58.670 --> 50:00.150]  He's not that grumpy.
[50:00.150 --> 50:00.990]  That's awesome.
[50:00.990 --> 50:01.830]  That's true love.
[50:01.830 --> 50:02.670]  That is love.
[50:02.670 --> 50:03.550]  That's longer than I've been alive, granny.
[50:03.550 --> 50:04.710]  Me too, that's pretty cool.
[50:04.710 --> 50:06.470]  He is my life partner.
[50:06.470 --> 50:07.310]  That's awesome.
[50:07.310 --> 50:09.190]  You know, and it's good things and bad things
[50:09.190 --> 50:11.150]  as every relationship is, right?
[50:11.150 --> 50:12.310]  I liked that he watched out for you
[50:12.310 --> 50:14.230]  and didn't let you do a handstand.
[50:14.550 --> 50:17.470]  He did not want to call 911 for his love today.
[50:17.470 --> 50:20.510]  He was like, no, you're not going to do that.
[50:20.510 --> 50:21.710]  But I want to.
[50:22.670 --> 50:23.950]  We'll get it done.
[50:23.950 --> 50:24.790]  We got this.
[50:24.790 --> 50:26.430]  We'll just make it look like an upside down dab.
[50:26.430 --> 50:27.630]  We've got editing.
[50:27.630 --> 50:28.510]  I've got iMovie.
[50:28.510 --> 50:30.470]  We'll make something happen for you.
[50:30.470 --> 50:31.310]  All right.
[50:31.310 --> 50:32.630]  What state did you live in
[50:32.630 --> 50:34.790]  when you started consuming cannabis at the age of 14?
[50:34.790 --> 50:37.710]  I am an Iowa corn whore.
[50:41.030 --> 50:43.270]  I think that might be better than Terpsilat somehow.
[50:43.310 --> 50:44.750]  Corn whore and a Terpsilat.
[50:44.750 --> 50:45.590]  That's quite an evolution.
[50:45.590 --> 50:47.870]  What happens in the cornfield stays in the cornfield.
[50:47.870 --> 50:49.550]  That is, it's the first time ever.
[50:49.550 --> 50:51.830]  Brett knows, Brett is from Illinois.
[50:51.830 --> 50:54.590]  Yeah, what happens in the cornfield stays in the cornfield.
[50:54.590 --> 50:56.070]  I like that saying.
[50:56.070 --> 50:57.550]  I haven't heard that in a while.
[50:57.550 --> 50:58.390]  I'm from Baltimore.
[50:58.390 --> 50:59.830]  I've never been to a cornfield.
[50:59.830 --> 51:01.270]  They don't have hockey in Baltimore either,
[51:01.270 --> 51:02.670]  we talked about earlier.
[51:02.670 --> 51:04.430]  Hockey doesn't exist, Brett.
[51:04.430 --> 51:06.830]  Hockey exists everywhere.
[51:06.830 --> 51:07.670]  Go Blackhawks.
[51:09.110 --> 51:10.470]  The look on his face.
[51:10.470 --> 51:11.910]  You say hockey doesn't exist.
[51:11.910 --> 51:13.590]  How hard was it for you to get some cannabis
[51:13.590 --> 51:15.150]  when you lived in the corn?
[51:15.150 --> 51:16.790]  Were they just growing cannabis up in the corn also?
[51:16.790 --> 51:18.430]  Actually, I started meeting guys
[51:18.430 --> 51:20.150]  coming back from the Vietnam War.
[51:20.150 --> 51:21.230]  Ah, you told us about that.
[51:21.230 --> 51:23.430]  Yeah, that's where it all started.
[51:23.430 --> 51:27.070]  You know, I was exposed to first cannabis
[51:27.070 --> 51:28.830]  and then many other things.
[51:28.830 --> 51:30.470]  Slowly progressed.
[51:30.470 --> 51:31.310]  Yeah.
[51:31.310 --> 51:32.150]  Okay.
[51:32.150 --> 51:32.990]  And at this point in my life,
[51:32.990 --> 51:35.790]  I can truly say with life experience,
[51:35.790 --> 51:37.950]  don't mess with that other shit.
[51:37.950 --> 51:38.990]  I can agree with that.
[51:38.990 --> 51:42.270]  I mean, okay, you young folks say
[51:42.270 --> 51:45.710]  you need your spiritual experiences with psychedelics.
[51:45.710 --> 51:46.790]  I respect that.
[51:48.110 --> 51:49.950]  I'm not gonna do it.
[51:49.950 --> 51:52.230]  And as far as like meth and stuff,
[51:52.230 --> 51:54.150]  ooh man, that's poison.
[51:54.150 --> 51:55.590]  Stay away from that crap.
[51:55.590 --> 51:57.270]  Yeah, anything that anybody has to make,
[51:57.270 --> 51:58.110]  stay away from that.
[51:58.110 --> 51:59.270]  I know that sounds contradictory
[51:59.270 --> 52:00.350]  because we smoke terps,
[52:00.350 --> 52:02.670]  but we're extracting something from groan.
[52:02.670 --> 52:04.390]  The meth, you gotta put it together.
[52:04.390 --> 52:07.150]  Brett, is this just yoga time suddenly?
[52:07.150 --> 52:08.030]  All right, thumbs up.
[52:08.030 --> 52:08.870]  Here we go.
[52:09.710 --> 52:10.550]  You got to loosen up for them dabs.
[52:10.550 --> 52:12.430]  Doing some bridges and then we're gonna do some big dabs.
[52:12.430 --> 52:14.270]  All right, I like the way you roll, buddy.
[52:14.270 --> 52:16.070]  He's prepping for an upside downer.
[52:18.070 --> 52:19.830]  Yoga dabs over here.
[52:19.830 --> 52:22.110]  All right, so Granny meets these handsome young men
[52:22.110 --> 52:24.470]  coming back from Vietnam and started smoking cannabis
[52:24.470 --> 52:26.350]  in Iowa out in the corn,
[52:26.350 --> 52:28.550]  grazing hell being a youngster.
[52:28.550 --> 52:30.670]  When did you move to Colorado?
[52:30.670 --> 52:34.430]  I've lived here 24 years now.
[52:34.430 --> 52:36.830]  Oh, so you were here before the cannabis revolution?
[52:36.830 --> 52:37.670]  Yes.
[52:37.670 --> 52:38.510]  Okay.
[52:39.150 --> 52:40.150]  Before I smoked cannabis?
[52:40.150 --> 52:40.990]  Yes.
[52:40.990 --> 52:41.830]  Oh, far before the revolution.
[52:41.830 --> 52:42.670]  Oh, of course.
[52:42.670 --> 52:43.510]  Guaranteed.
[52:43.510 --> 52:46.510]  I lived in Europe before I came here.
[52:46.510 --> 52:50.870]  They didn't have cannabis, but they had hashish.
[52:50.870 --> 52:52.110]  Plenty of hashish in Europe.
[52:52.110 --> 52:52.950]  Yeah, they don't smoke a lot of plants.
[52:52.950 --> 52:55.790]  Yes, no, they didn't have a lot of flour.
[52:55.790 --> 52:58.390]  And you know, this has been a long time ago
[52:58.390 --> 53:00.950]  and I'm telling things, I'm telling secrets,
[53:00.950 --> 53:05.230]  but I would every now and again, get my hands on cannabis.
[53:05.230 --> 53:09.590]  Oh boy, did the Europeans love American cannabis?
[53:09.590 --> 53:10.430]  Oh, I bet.
[53:11.550 --> 53:16.550]  And I always, I just have always found people that consume.
[53:18.430 --> 53:19.870]  We're like-minded folks.
[53:19.870 --> 53:22.350]  We like to, you can always find, it's like,
[53:22.350 --> 53:24.390]  if you get a new job, if you go to a new school,
[53:24.390 --> 53:27.030]  if you move to a new town, if you go to a new whatever,
[53:27.030 --> 53:29.110]  if you're an archer into archery,
[53:29.110 --> 53:30.430]  when you go to that new archery class,
[53:30.430 --> 53:31.830]  whatever it is, if you're a glass blower,
[53:31.830 --> 53:33.390]  you walk in, if you're a glass blower,
[53:33.390 --> 53:34.790]  everyone smokes, bad example.
[53:35.350 --> 53:36.590]  But if you walk into most places,
[53:36.590 --> 53:37.950]  you can look around the room and be like,
[53:37.950 --> 53:40.830]  ah, that dude over there, he's a turpor just like me.
[53:40.830 --> 53:42.710]  I'm gonna go hang out and kind of feel the waters out.
[53:42.710 --> 53:43.550]  And when it's a break time, I'm like,
[53:43.550 --> 53:47.110]  so you want to go fucking get some 420 on?
[53:47.110 --> 53:48.350]  And you can always just find
[53:48.350 --> 53:50.150]  the like-minded potheads in the group.
[53:50.150 --> 53:52.150]  It's just because we put a vibe out.
[53:52.150 --> 53:56.430]  We're, there's a few haters in the community,
[53:56.430 --> 54:00.150]  but you know, that's like every, every sect of life,
[54:00.150 --> 54:01.990]  you're going to have a few bad people.
[54:01.990 --> 54:02.830]  Of course.
[54:02.830 --> 54:04.350]  But for the most part,
[54:04.350 --> 54:07.950]  the people in the cannabis community are happy people.
[54:07.950 --> 54:11.350]  We're loving people.
[54:11.350 --> 54:12.750]  We want to help each other.
[54:12.750 --> 54:17.030]  We want to help other human beings and we love the earth.
[54:17.030 --> 54:18.390]  We want to respect it.
[54:18.390 --> 54:23.150]  I mean, we're all pretty like-minded.
[54:23.150 --> 54:24.510]  We're all connected in that one way.
[54:24.510 --> 54:27.430]  We, if we don't love, if we don't take care of the earth,
[54:27.430 --> 54:28.950]  we can't grow cannabis.
[54:28.950 --> 54:30.510]  Cannabis makes us more peaceful.
[54:30.510 --> 54:31.550]  It makes us more connected.
[54:31.550 --> 54:33.230]  It makes us easier to love each other.
[54:33.230 --> 54:35.830]  You ever taken a big dab and been like, fuck that person.
[54:35.830 --> 54:38.550]  You take a big dab and you're like, nah, it'll be okay.
[54:38.550 --> 54:40.750]  You're never angry as you're blowing out a dab.
[54:40.750 --> 54:42.550]  No, I'm never angry.
[54:42.550 --> 54:43.870]  Yeah, I've never seen you angry.
[54:43.870 --> 54:46.070]  Because you know, this is, think about it.
[54:47.030 --> 54:50.350]  You can be angry at somebody and know it's ugly.
[54:50.350 --> 54:51.790]  And I heard that.
[54:51.790 --> 54:52.990]  What are you popping over there, bro?
[54:52.990 --> 54:53.830]  That's weird.
[54:55.030 --> 54:55.870]  His piggy.
[54:55.870 --> 54:56.950]  You popped your piggy.
[54:56.950 --> 54:58.230]  He's popping his piggy.
[54:59.950 --> 55:00.830]  Let's just keep moving.
[55:00.830 --> 55:03.030]  Cause this is getting weird.
[55:03.030 --> 55:06.110]  But you know, you're so angry at your neighbor or whatever.
[55:06.110 --> 55:09.750]  It's an anger is a pretty ugly emotion.
[55:11.150 --> 55:14.470]  Does your neighbor know that it's eating you up?
[55:14.470 --> 55:16.150]  Probably not.
[55:16.150 --> 55:17.310]  So who's it hurting?
[55:17.310 --> 55:19.110]  Yeah, he's renting space in your head for free.
[55:19.110 --> 55:20.230]  Give it up.
[55:20.230 --> 55:21.150]  It isn't worth it.
[55:21.150 --> 55:22.190]  Yeah, let it go.
[55:22.190 --> 55:23.430]  Go talk to him.
[55:23.430 --> 55:24.270]  Yeah.
[55:24.270 --> 55:25.350]  All right.
[55:25.350 --> 55:26.830]  Granny, you're awesome to have on the podcast.
[55:26.830 --> 55:28.110]  I like some of the stuff you say.
[55:28.110 --> 55:29.270]  You said a second ago
[55:29.310 --> 55:31.070]  that you're telling your dark secrets.
[55:31.070 --> 55:32.710]  What's something that you've never shared with anybody
[55:32.710 --> 55:34.030]  that you want to tell us here on the podcast?
[55:34.030 --> 55:34.870]  I'm going to put you on the spot like that.
[55:34.870 --> 55:36.390]  Cause I want to know what you're going to say.
[55:36.390 --> 55:37.390]  Killing it.
[55:37.390 --> 55:39.030]  She just did the hand on the chin thing
[55:39.030 --> 55:40.310]  and looked up at the sky.
[55:40.310 --> 55:41.430]  I like this lady.
[55:43.870 --> 55:44.910]  Okay.
[55:44.910 --> 55:49.470]  I will say that I, obviously I've done a lot in my life
[55:49.470 --> 55:52.750]  and I have no criminal record.
[55:53.830 --> 55:55.390]  I'm still alive.
[55:55.390 --> 55:57.670]  And that amazes me when I think back
[55:57.710 --> 55:59.510]  at some of the things I've done.
[56:00.790 --> 56:05.790]  So I'm destined to be here right now as Dab and Granny.
[56:06.350 --> 56:07.190]  Guaranteed.
[56:07.190 --> 56:10.030]  We're all destined to be right here, right at this moment.
[56:10.030 --> 56:12.230]  Some of my favorite friends, even Sam, the new guy.
[56:12.230 --> 56:13.110]  Bro, I like your vibe.
[56:13.110 --> 56:14.390]  I like what you know.
[56:14.390 --> 56:15.230]  We're going to hang out more.
[56:15.230 --> 56:16.070]  Thank you for having me.
[56:16.070 --> 56:17.390]  Oh man, thanks for coming.
[56:17.390 --> 56:18.630]  So we've been going for almost an hour.
[56:18.630 --> 56:20.390]  It's time to do that thing where we talk
[56:20.390 --> 56:22.510]  about everybody's social media connections.
[56:22.510 --> 56:23.910]  And I think everybody's up for coming.
[56:23.910 --> 56:27.150]  So Dab and Granny, tell everybody how everybody can find you
[56:27.150 --> 56:28.030]  on all the social media.
[56:28.030 --> 56:30.150]  Let them know about the YouTube, Facebook, Instagram,
[56:30.150 --> 56:30.990]  everything you got.
[56:30.990 --> 56:32.590]  I'm on YouTube.
[56:32.590 --> 56:35.350]  I think I'm dabbing underscore granny.
[56:35.350 --> 56:40.350]  I'm on Instagram, dabbing underscore granny, Snapchat.
[56:40.430 --> 56:44.030]  I'm on Facebook and I'm kind of liking this live stream
[56:44.030 --> 56:44.870]  and on Facebook.
[56:44.870 --> 56:46.670]  You do great Facebook live videos.
[56:46.670 --> 56:48.270]  I just started doing that.
[56:48.270 --> 56:50.430]  I don't have a lot of followers yet.
[56:50.430 --> 56:52.270]  It's only a few people and they like it.
[56:52.270 --> 56:53.830]  We'll probably take a dab on Facebook live
[56:53.830 --> 56:55.430]  as the end of this recording wraps up.
[56:55.430 --> 56:56.270]  Let's do that.
[56:56.310 --> 56:57.630]  We'll do it together.
[56:57.630 --> 56:58.470]  Definitely.
[56:58.470 --> 56:59.310]  Awesome.
[56:59.310 --> 57:04.150]  And obviously because I am the Dab and Granny,
[57:04.150 --> 57:07.670]  I consume a large amount of medicine.
[57:07.670 --> 57:09.510]  I have to have a few sponsors.
[57:09.510 --> 57:10.350]  So I'm gonna shout them out if that's okay.
[57:10.350 --> 57:11.750]  That was gonna be the next thing I did.
[57:11.750 --> 57:12.590]  I would love to hear that.
[57:12.590 --> 57:13.990]  First ones are Dabado.
[57:13.990 --> 57:16.630]  I know they take a lot of grief about their product,
[57:16.630 --> 57:17.950]  but as far as I'm concerned,
[57:17.950 --> 57:20.350]  there's many of those portable emails out there
[57:20.350 --> 57:22.790]  branded under many names.
[57:22.790 --> 57:24.990]  Any one of those companies could have come and said,
[57:25.110 --> 57:26.550]  hey, we like you.
[57:26.550 --> 57:27.670]  We're gonna help you.
[57:27.670 --> 57:28.510]  They didn't.
[57:28.510 --> 57:29.590]  Dabado did.
[57:29.590 --> 57:31.310]  I like Dabado.
[57:31.310 --> 57:34.790]  Ooze 420, they have pens, they have silicone things.
[57:34.790 --> 57:36.030]  They make exit bags,
[57:36.030 --> 57:38.390]  which you have to have at every dispensary
[57:38.390 --> 57:40.270]  here in Colorado.
[57:40.270 --> 57:43.790]  And then I'm gonna be repping Megatoke,
[57:43.790 --> 57:46.070]  which is smoking cannabis.
[57:46.070 --> 57:48.310]  So this is gonna be smoking flour,
[57:48.310 --> 57:50.790]  which is kind of different for me.
[57:50.790 --> 57:54.670]  So be watching for me to be doing some more Megatokes.
[57:55.590 --> 57:58.550]  Granny, how much hash do you smoke in one day on average?
[57:58.550 --> 57:59.910]  About four to five grams.
[57:59.910 --> 58:02.510]  Four to five grams of good quality shatter
[58:02.510 --> 58:04.510]  or live resin every day, you guys.
[58:04.510 --> 58:05.350]  That's amazing.
[58:05.350 --> 58:06.190]  That's impressive.
[58:06.190 --> 58:08.790]  She keeps up with me if she doesn't outdo me.
[58:08.790 --> 58:10.710]  My budget can't keep up with that.
[58:10.710 --> 58:12.790]  I told you, Nevada, here I come.
[58:14.470 --> 58:16.150]  And she means Nevada Avenue, you guys.
[58:16.150 --> 58:17.830]  You can find her up near Cimarron.
[58:18.750 --> 58:20.870]  That's why I have to have a few sponsors.
[58:20.870 --> 58:22.790]  I know people are like, well, you shouldn't do that,
[58:22.790 --> 58:24.470]  but I have to.
[58:25.270 --> 58:26.110]  So shout out to the sponsors.
[58:26.110 --> 58:27.670]  I love that this community is willing to sponsor each other
[58:27.670 --> 58:28.870]  and help each other out.
[58:28.870 --> 58:30.190]  That makes the wheels go around.
[58:30.190 --> 58:31.030]  That's right.
[58:31.030 --> 58:32.110]  Granny, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[58:32.110 --> 58:33.830]  I look forward to having you on future episodes
[58:33.830 --> 58:35.390]  because I love your vibe.
[58:35.390 --> 58:36.550]  You need to have your own show.
[58:36.550 --> 58:38.350]  I hear that may be a possibility in the future.
[58:38.350 --> 58:39.950]  I'm going to encourage that.
[58:39.950 --> 58:41.270]  I'm being told not to talk too much about it,
[58:41.270 --> 58:42.270]  but you need your own damn show.
[58:42.270 --> 58:43.110]  That's what I think.
[58:43.110 --> 58:43.950]  I've said that before.
[58:43.950 --> 58:44.950]  You need a show.
[58:44.950 --> 58:45.790]  Thank you, Jeff.
[58:45.790 --> 58:46.630]  Anytime.
[58:46.630 --> 58:47.470]  We're gonna hang out and do some tabs.
[58:47.470 --> 58:48.390]  We're gonna do a Facebook Live together.
[58:48.390 --> 58:50.310]  Sam, thanks for joining me, dude.
[58:50.310 --> 58:51.150]  Thank you very much for having me.
[58:51.150 --> 58:51.990]  I appreciate it.
[58:52.510 --> 58:54.310]  Remind everyone, oh, your first podcast.
[58:54.310 --> 58:55.150]  Nice.
[58:55.150 --> 58:55.990]  Thanks for coming.
[58:55.990 --> 58:58.310]  It's these guys' first podcast too, kind of.
[58:59.550 --> 59:00.390]  1.5.
[59:00.390 --> 59:01.230]  1.5.
[59:01.230 --> 59:02.070]  First one was a practice run.
[59:02.070 --> 59:04.030]  Remind everybody where they can find you on social media
[59:04.030 --> 59:05.550]  and then tell us about the magazine.
[59:05.550 --> 59:08.670]  Me personally, it's at THC underscore Samuel.
[59:08.670 --> 59:09.510]  Excuse me.
[59:09.510 --> 59:10.510]  Yeah, THC underscore Samuel.
[59:10.510 --> 59:12.950]  And the magazine is at The Hemp Connoisseur.
[59:12.950 --> 59:13.790]  Awesome.
[59:13.790 --> 59:14.630]  Check them out, you guys.
[59:14.630 --> 59:15.470]  Make sure you follow The Hemp Connoisseur.
[59:15.470 --> 59:16.310]  It's a great magazine.
[59:16.310 --> 59:17.150]  Well made.
[59:17.150 --> 59:18.190]  Well printed.
[59:18.190 --> 59:19.030]  Brett, it's time.
[59:19.030 --> 59:19.870]  Grab the mic, buddy.
[59:19.870 --> 59:20.710]  Yo!
[59:21.230 --> 59:23.750]  This is the white turp pimp.
[59:23.750 --> 59:24.590]  What?
[59:26.190 --> 59:29.390]  You guys, he's got a hat with a feather in it on.
[59:29.390 --> 59:30.230]  Coming at you live.
[59:30.230 --> 59:31.550]  Coming at you live.
[59:31.550 --> 59:33.270]  At the candy canyon.
[59:33.270 --> 59:34.310]  At the candy.
[59:34.310 --> 59:37.670]  Down here, we watched Jeff and the turps.
[59:37.670 --> 59:39.110]  You've always wanted to do this.
[59:39.110 --> 59:39.950]  I have, actually.
[59:39.950 --> 59:40.790]  You've always been crazy about this.
[59:40.790 --> 59:41.870]  And honestly, like,
[59:41.870 --> 59:43.710]  so I'm gonna throw this out there right now
[59:43.710 --> 59:45.270]  because I've never said this.
[59:45.270 --> 59:47.030]  And some of these people on the podcast
[59:47.030 --> 59:49.590]  are gonna fucking laugh and I'm gonna laugh.
[59:49.630 --> 59:52.070]  But dude, I've actually seen you before.
[59:52.070 --> 59:53.390]  This is like way back.
[59:53.390 --> 59:55.030]  Like, this is before we even met.
[59:56.110 --> 59:58.230]  So, he's intimidating.
[59:58.230 --> 01:00:00.350]  He's like a 6'6", dude.
[01:00:00.350 --> 01:00:01.990]  6'5", like maybe 6'6".
[01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:03.910]  I'm saying with the hat, with the dreads,
[01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:05.470]  you can get a little tall, man.
[01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:09.910]  And when you actually know what he does and who he is,
[01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:11.190]  he can be intimidating.
[01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:14.830]  I actually saw him at, it was some cannabis event.
[01:00:14.830 --> 01:00:18.230]  It was, had to be, I think Champs.
[01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:19.070]  Possible.
[01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:21.430]  And I saw you and I was like,
[01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:24.150]  is that that dude Ross the Jeff
[01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:27.670]  that I have followed his genetics and shit for a while?
[01:00:27.670 --> 01:00:29.150]  And I couldn't even say what's up
[01:00:29.150 --> 01:00:31.350]  because I didn't even know what to talk about
[01:00:31.350 --> 01:00:32.910]  and even how to approach you.
[01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:33.910]  But now, like, look at me.
[01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:35.590]  I'm just like, let's take a dab.
[01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.430]  Yeah, bro, yeah.
[01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:38.790]  I am so appreciative
[01:00:38.790 --> 01:00:40.950]  that you have asked me to be on your show.
[01:00:40.950 --> 01:00:41.870]  Like, you have no idea.
[01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:42.990]  This is a dream come true.
[01:00:42.990 --> 01:00:44.630]  So, thank you so much, man.
[01:00:44.630 --> 01:00:46.990]  Brett, at the end of the day,
[01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:51.310]  didn't this teach you that every one of us were all alike?
[01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:52.710]  We're all people, bro.
[01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:53.630]  Well, it's the funny thing
[01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:55.110]  is I've had actually people come up to me
[01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:56.710]  and it's like, I've seen you at a sesh a couple of times.
[01:00:56.710 --> 01:00:58.350]  I didn't want to say hi, but I didn't know what to say.
[01:00:58.350 --> 01:00:59.190]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.230]  I've been in the same place, man.
[01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.990]  So, but first off, I appreciate it.
[01:01:01.990 --> 01:01:04.270]  I appreciate the admiration and the respect.
[01:01:04.270 --> 01:01:05.550]  I completely appreciate that.
[01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:06.750]  And it's returned.
[01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:09.870]  Bro, you are a lab manager for a well-known lab
[01:01:09.870 --> 01:01:12.230]  that makes one of my favorite products.
[01:01:12.230 --> 01:01:15.870]  Like, yeah, you guys are breaking ground every day.
[01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:19.230]  EvoLabCO2 on Instagram.
[01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:20.590]  Follow us.
[01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:22.710]  We do have a lot of good terps.
[01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:23.550]  Sam, you want to jump in?
[01:01:23.550 --> 01:01:24.390]  Go for it.
[01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:25.230]  Yeah, to backpack off him.
[01:01:25.230 --> 01:01:26.070]  You know, we really do appreciate it.
[01:01:26.070 --> 01:01:26.890]  I really appreciate it, you know,
[01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:27.730]  having me on the podcast
[01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:29.190]  and everybody at the Hemp Connoisseur appreciates it.
[01:01:29.190 --> 01:01:30.470]  We're going to get you guys on again
[01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:33.110]  to do an in-depth episode about terpenes,
[01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:34.110]  how terps are made.
[01:01:34.110 --> 01:01:35.190]  I got the perfect person.
[01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:36.270]  We're going to go in depth.
[01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:37.790]  We're going to get you guys more terp nerds on here.
[01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:40.630]  Like a real knowledge than not sit around.
[01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:41.470]  Right, right.
[01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:42.310]  Like PhD doctors.
[01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:43.150]  Right, we'll do it here again,
[01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:44.990]  but I mean, we're going to get terpy on that one.
[01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:46.510]  We're just going to go real nerd-like
[01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:48.910]  so that only a few people even understand the terminology.
[01:01:48.910 --> 01:01:51.510]  Because those are some people's favorite episodes.
[01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.790]  Those used to be mine.
[01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:54.590]  Our audience gets divided by like
[01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:57.590]  the folks that love the sit-arounds
[01:01:57.590 --> 01:01:59.530]  and the folks that love the like science
[01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:00.870]  and the folks that love the grow.
[01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:02.030]  There's kind of some divides,
[01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:03.550]  but I love it all, so I do it all.
[01:02:03.550 --> 01:02:04.370]  Definitely.
[01:02:04.370 --> 01:02:05.210]  Yeah, Brett, thanks for coming, dude.
[01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:06.550]  I look forward to doing more podcasts
[01:02:06.550 --> 01:02:08.310]  with you and you both.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:09.230]  Cannot wait.
[01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:10.070]  Yes, yes.
[01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:11.510]  And thanks for being a fan boy.
[01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:12.550]  Oh, always.
[01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.590]  If you see me in an event,
[01:02:13.590 --> 01:02:15.510]  and I'm pretty sure I can speak for everybody at this table,
[01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.350]  we're just people.
[01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:17.950]  We get thirsty when we wake up.
[01:02:17.950 --> 01:02:18.910]  We got to pee in the morning.
[01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:21.190]  We like to take dabs around six o'clock.
[01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:22.270]  I want some food.
[01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:23.870]  Where does normal people walk up, say hi?
[01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:27.470]  If you do not say hi to me and you know who I am,
[01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:30.410]  I will be very upset because I know eventually
[01:02:30.410 --> 01:02:32.310]  I will say what's up to you.
[01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:34.190]  And if you say the same thing I've said
[01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:36.190]  and you've heard this and you say this thing,
[01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.710]  I'm like, yo, bro, I've told you.
[01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:40.190]  Cause this is me talking to you.
[01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:41.030]  Some people are shy.
[01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.670]  So come say what's up, let's dab.
[01:02:42.670 --> 01:02:43.510]  Honestly, let's talk about it.
[01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:44.950]  Brett's obviously not that shy.
[01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:47.110]  I get that I am 6'5 and I've got dreadlocks
[01:02:47.110 --> 01:02:48.630]  down to my, almost my knees.
[01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:51.350]  And yeah, yeah, I get that I could be intimidating.
[01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.750]  I usually got three or four people hanging out with me.
[01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:56.710]  When you're so well known in the industry
[01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:57.990]  and you know what you're doing.
[01:02:57.990 --> 01:03:00.710]  And then you hear that deep radio voice.
[01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:04.510]  It's like, what is behind that voice?
[01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.190]  Come say hello and I'll be your friend.
[01:03:06.190 --> 01:03:07.030]  We can hang out.
[01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:08.190]  We can take some dabs.
[01:03:08.190 --> 01:03:09.230]  We can take some selfies.
[01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:11.310]  We can record a podcast.
[01:03:11.310 --> 01:03:14.910]  That's a 1-900 Rasta Jeff podcast voice.
[01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.550]  1-900 Rasta Jeff.
[01:03:17.550 --> 01:03:18.470]  No, that doesn't happen.
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:19.310]  Don't do that, please.
[01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:20.150]  That's weird.
[01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:23.550]  No, I said that, but.
[01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:25.230]  I know I'm being weird.
[01:03:25.230 --> 01:03:26.470]  But he has that kind of voice.
[01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:27.590]  I mean, you know.
[01:03:27.590 --> 01:03:30.830]  This is his smooth Barry Manilow podcast voice.
[01:03:30.830 --> 01:03:31.830]  Oh, Barry Manilow.
[01:03:31.830 --> 01:03:33.510]  That's what he turns it on to.
[01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:36.430]  You got the Captain and Tennille over here.
[01:03:36.430 --> 01:03:38.150]  Muskrat love.
[01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:39.910]  What did that guy ask?
[01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:40.830]  What are we gonna do?
[01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:41.990]  Squash?
[01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:42.830]  Smash.
[01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:43.670]  Oh, smash.
[01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:45.390]  Somebody on Facebook, I posted this.
[01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.230]  Squash.
[01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:47.070]  What are you gonna do?
[01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:48.350]  Are you gonna squash?
[01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:49.870]  If we were in New Jersey, it could be.
[01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:50.990]  You gonna squash?
[01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.270]  You gonna squash later?
[01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:54.150]  So I posted to Facebook that I was setting up
[01:03:54.150 --> 01:03:55.750]  to record a podcast with Dab and Granny.
[01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:57.470]  And someone on Facebook, the first comment was,
[01:03:57.470 --> 01:03:58.870]  y'all gonna smash after?
[01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:01.950]  And she's like, what's smash?
[01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:04.470]  I know now.
[01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:05.950]  Probably not, I'm sorry.
[01:04:05.950 --> 01:04:07.710]  But if we do, there will be video.
[01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:09.550]  And we'll post it to Facebook
[01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:11.190]  and you guys will get to check it out.
[01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.670]  Facebook Live, right after this show.
[01:04:13.670 --> 01:04:15.030]  I'm gonna hurry up and tune in.
[01:04:15.030 --> 01:04:16.830]  I didn't sign up for that.
[01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.630]  I don't think anyone in the room signed up for that.
[01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:21.230]  No, no, I didn't get paid enough for that tonight.
[01:04:21.230 --> 01:04:23.030]  I hope your grandpa's gonna be upset.
[01:04:24.310 --> 01:04:25.950]  All right, Chris, you got a microphone in your hand.
[01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:26.790]  I do.
[01:04:26.790 --> 01:04:28.470]  Tell everybody your Instagram and or Snapchat
[01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:29.670]  and or social medias.
[01:04:29.670 --> 01:04:34.230]  And then also tell us a whole bunch about Burniture.
[01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:35.070]  Burniture.
[01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:37.670]  Okay, well, I'm Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:04:37.670 --> 01:04:40.070]  B-O-B-O Blaster Co.
[01:04:40.070 --> 01:04:42.350]  Yeah, you can find me on Instagram.
[01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.950]  My Snapchat, I don't even know my Snapchat name, honestly.
[01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:48.670]  I think I might have it listed on my Instagram.
[01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:49.510]  So I'm not sure.
[01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:50.350]  You got Twitter?
[01:04:50.350 --> 01:04:51.190]  I don't tweet.
[01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:53.790]  You're just liking on social medias, bro.
[01:04:53.790 --> 01:04:54.710]  I was excited.
[01:04:54.710 --> 01:04:55.550]  I thought I was gonna hear a whole slew of words.
[01:04:55.550 --> 01:04:57.470]  I'm a master, don't really use that.
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:04:58.510]  It's there.
[01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:59.790]  It's Bobo Blaster Co. too.
[01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:00.630]  You can find me that too.
[01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.310]  I want some of your furniture.
[01:05:02.310 --> 01:05:03.150]  Tell me about that.
[01:05:03.150 --> 01:05:04.310]  Oh yeah, so the Burniture.
[01:05:04.990 --> 01:05:07.870]  I have a whole bunch of sweet little furniture ideas.
[01:05:07.870 --> 01:05:08.710]  Well, not ideas.
[01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:10.870]  I have a whole bunch of products that are available
[01:05:10.870 --> 01:05:15.870]  on burniture.bigcartel.com.
[01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:19.270]  And basically I make coffee tables and tables.
[01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:23.770]  I have shelves that with basically emails built into it.
[01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:27.910]  So you don't have to have a clumsy little pod or cluster.
[01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:29.390]  We're gonna work out a deal after this,
[01:05:29.390 --> 01:05:30.630]  cause I need one.
[01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:31.470]  Yes, yes.
[01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:34.870]  That's why he's not all over social media, Rasta Jeff.
[01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:38.670]  He's too busy building quality furniture.
[01:05:38.670 --> 01:05:39.510]  Yeah.
[01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:41.110]  How long ago did you give me my table?
[01:05:41.110 --> 01:05:42.270]  That was over a year ago now.
[01:05:42.270 --> 01:05:43.110]  Over a year ago.
[01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:43.950]  That's what we were just talking about the other day
[01:05:43.950 --> 01:05:45.030]  on another podcast.
[01:05:45.030 --> 01:05:45.870]  That was-
[01:05:45.870 --> 01:05:47.110]  And it still works, no problem.
[01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:47.950]  It's still jamming.
[01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:49.470]  That was like an original, original one too.
[01:05:49.470 --> 01:05:50.630]  The paint's kinda beat up, but I mean,
[01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:51.990]  you know, that means it's been used.
[01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.830]  100%.
[01:05:52.830 --> 01:05:54.150]  It's not just a decoration.
[01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:55.670]  Yeah, that was what we were saying.
[01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:56.950]  That's why I'm happy I sent it to him,
[01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:59.430]  cause that's what I sent it over to him for,
[01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.710]  was to really get that work into it.
[01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:03.390]  That was one of my first original ones,
[01:06:03.390 --> 01:06:04.230]  and I was like, what?
[01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:05.990]  Nice, you got the OG furniture table.
[01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:07.470]  Who really do I know and I've seen
[01:06:07.470 --> 01:06:08.910]  who like really just dabs,
[01:06:08.910 --> 01:06:10.950]  and Rasta Jeff's that guy.
[01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:11.910]  I take some dabs.
[01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:12.750]  Well, thank you, bro.
[01:06:12.750 --> 01:06:13.570]  I appreciate it.
[01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:14.410]  It's a great sample.
[01:06:14.410 --> 01:06:15.250]  It's a great product.
[01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:16.070]  I fully endorse furniture tables.
[01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:16.910]  Sweet, thank you.
[01:06:16.910 --> 01:06:18.510]  If you're in the Colorado Springs area,
[01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:19.390]  we can get you locally.
[01:06:19.390 --> 01:06:20.870]  If you're in Pueblo, we can get you locally.
[01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:22.430]  We'll probably get you taken care of in Denver too.
[01:06:22.430 --> 01:06:23.270]  Yeah.
[01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:24.350]  Yeah, we'll figure it out, get you a furniture table.
[01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:25.190]  Definitely, definitely.
[01:06:25.190 --> 01:06:26.030]  If not, we'll ship them to you.
[01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:27.910]  Also, I do like custom stuff.
[01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:30.430]  If you have stuff on like ideas you want to come to me,
[01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:32.270]  like yeah, you want Peli cases,
[01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:35.350]  you want game consoles,
[01:06:35.350 --> 01:06:37.310]  anything you have like random ideas.
[01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:38.150]  I have kids that come to me,
[01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:40.230]  and they're just like, hey, put this in a shoe.
[01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:41.630]  I'm like, yeah, I'd probably put it in a shoe.
[01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:42.950]  Just give me a pair of shoes
[01:06:42.950 --> 01:06:44.790]  and I could probably put it in a shoe.
[01:06:44.790 --> 01:06:47.310]  If you have something, we can work it out.
[01:06:47.310 --> 01:06:48.630]  Did you say under a dash?
[01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:49.470]  Yeah, just have an email.
[01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:52.110]  Like a portable, really on the go email.
[01:06:52.110 --> 01:06:53.190]  On the go, yeah.
[01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:54.750]  Just coming out of the dashboard.
[01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:55.790]  I know that's highly illegal.
[01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:57.390]  I should not talk like that.
[01:06:57.390 --> 01:06:58.230]  We were making a joke.
[01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:59.670]  For camping, for camping.
[01:06:59.670 --> 01:07:00.510]  Yeah, car camping.
[01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:02.550]  Or an outdoor experience, yes.
[01:07:02.550 --> 01:07:04.070]  When you're stuck in fucking traffic
[01:07:04.070 --> 01:07:05.950]  between Denver and Springs for an hour and a half
[01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:08.110]  and you move 10 feet because there's a wreck up there
[01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:09.670]  and nobody cares if you're taking a dab or not
[01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:11.190]  because you're not going to drive for an hour anyway.
[01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:12.590]  Why can't I take a dab, officer?
[01:07:12.590 --> 01:07:14.830]  I just want, I just want, I just want, ah!
[01:07:14.830 --> 01:07:17.110]  I'm having a panic attack.
[01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:19.070]  I just, yeah, you just definitely gave white Mike
[01:07:19.070 --> 01:07:21.030]  a panic attack while he's listening to this.
[01:07:21.030 --> 01:07:21.870]  Sorry, Mike.
[01:07:21.870 --> 01:07:24.150]  That was so unfair of him.
[01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:25.990]  Mike is like, oh my God, he's talking about,
[01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:28.190]  oh my, oh my, oh my.
[01:07:28.190 --> 01:07:29.830]  Where's, I need to take a dab.
[01:07:29.830 --> 01:07:31.470]  Sometimes the traffic is horrendous, Mike.
[01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:32.990]  I'm sorry.
[01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:34.470]  All right, Bubba, thanks for making
[01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:35.310]  the killer furniture tables.
[01:07:35.310 --> 01:07:36.150]  No, thank you, thank you.
[01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.990]  Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:38.430]  Thank you always for the love.
[01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:40.230]  Thank you always for letting me on here.
[01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:41.510]  It was so great coming out here.
[01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:43.150]  I love meeting all you guys.
[01:07:43.150 --> 01:07:44.750]  Sam, it was awesome meeting you.
[01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:47.990]  And Dan, Granny, it was wonderful meeting you.
[01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.430]  This is such a great, awesome,
[01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:50.830]  it's great that being at Canyon Canyon
[01:07:50.830 --> 01:07:52.230]  and have Canyon Canyon and stuff like this
[01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:56.950]  and be able to meet so many people at once, it's great.
[01:07:56.950 --> 01:07:58.230]  But Canyon's a great place.
[01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:59.070]  I really appreciate it.
[01:07:59.070 --> 01:08:01.590]  You guys in states that are passing
[01:08:01.590 --> 01:08:05.150]  legalization for medical, please keep in mind,
[01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:06.910]  do not go strictly rec.
[01:08:06.910 --> 01:08:10.030]  I mean, there's people that really, truly need medical.
[01:08:10.030 --> 01:08:11.750]  Please keep that in mind.
[01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:16.750]  Secondly, remember you need places to gather and consume.
[01:08:19.350 --> 01:08:21.150]  You have people that have leases
[01:08:21.190 --> 01:08:24.230]  that they can't medicate in their own apartment.
[01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:25.350]  Where are they gonna go?
[01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.790]  You need places like this.
[01:08:27.790 --> 01:08:29.710]  We have learned here in Colorado.
[01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:33.070]  So listen to us, we're trying to help you.
[01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:35.150]  We're not being arrogant.
[01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:37.590]  Just put some forethought in a couple of things.
[01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:38.670]  Granny's completely right.
[01:08:38.670 --> 01:08:41.390]  In Colorado, we messed up when we wrote the bills here.
[01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:43.630]  We did not include consumption areas.
[01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:45.270]  So there's a gray area.
[01:08:45.270 --> 01:08:47.030]  These places can be shut down at any time.
[01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:48.990]  This Canyon Canyon where we are allowed
[01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:50.830]  to sit here at this table and gather peacefully
[01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:53.270]  and take some dabs and have a podcast together.
[01:08:53.270 --> 01:08:55.710]  This could be stopped at any moment with just a letter.
[01:08:55.710 --> 01:08:57.590]  All that would have to be done is a letter written
[01:08:57.590 --> 01:09:00.230]  and a judge says no more, and it could be over.
[01:09:00.230 --> 01:09:02.430]  So when you do get around to writing
[01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.390]  the legalization bills in your state,
[01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.830]  make sure you include these types of places.
[01:09:06.830 --> 01:09:09.150]  Make sure you put so many of these places available
[01:09:09.150 --> 01:09:11.790]  in so much locality and write rules for them.
[01:09:11.790 --> 01:09:13.630]  Because if you don't write rules,
[01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:15.590]  when it comes to make rules for cannabis legalization
[01:09:15.590 --> 01:09:17.750]  in your area, the rules will be written for you.
[01:09:17.750 --> 01:09:20.590]  And when they make the rules for you, you get really fucked.
[01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.510]  They say, okay, nothing then.
[01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:24.270]  If you let them write the rules, they don't give you shit.
[01:09:24.270 --> 01:09:25.870]  If you make the rules yourself,
[01:09:25.870 --> 01:09:27.230]  you can have experienced people on there
[01:09:27.230 --> 01:09:29.990]  that understand what this community wants and needs,
[01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:31.070]  and it can be done appropriately.
[01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:33.190]  So I encourage you, be a part of that.
[01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:35.430]  Make sure you get the social clubs and the legislation.
[01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:37.230]  When the time comes and the time is now,
[01:09:37.230 --> 01:09:38.750]  start doing it, get your shit together.
[01:09:38.750 --> 01:09:41.030]  Remember people, knowledge is power.
[01:09:42.190 --> 01:09:44.990]  We gotta keep this cannabis army on the march.
[01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:47.070]  Yes, just because we're getting recreation illegal
[01:09:47.070 --> 01:09:50.030]  in some places doesn't mean we can get lazy with it.
[01:09:50.070 --> 01:09:51.030]  Chris, thank you, bro.
[01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.870]  No, thank you.
[01:09:51.870 --> 01:09:54.470]  The beautiful Lindsey, Chris's better half.
[01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:58.550]  The lovely red dreads.
[01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:59.390]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:59.390 --> 01:10:00.990]  Looks like you cleaned up a little bit today, I like it.
[01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:02.670]  Give it a little buzz on the other sides.
[01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:04.950]  Yeah, I had to get a haircut, it was getting bad.
[01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:07.190]  Take the little fillies off.
[01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:09.510]  I actually like it better short like this.
[01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:10.350]  You get a little airflow.
[01:10:10.350 --> 01:10:11.590]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:13.590]  Like you lollipopped your head a little.
[01:10:16.350 --> 01:10:17.950]  Lindsey, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[01:10:17.950 --> 01:10:18.790]  Thank you for having me.
[01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:21.270]  Most of our listeners know how to find you by now,
[01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:25.310]  but remind everybody all of your social media connections.
[01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:28.190]  So my Instagram is the traveling stoner,
[01:10:28.190 --> 01:10:31.750]  my Snapchat is traveling stoner without the G,
[01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.950]  my Twitter is the travel stoner,
[01:10:33.950 --> 01:10:36.630]  and my Periscope is the traveling stoner.
[01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:38.710]  You are one traveling stoner.
[01:10:38.710 --> 01:10:39.550]  That's me.
[01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:40.390]  I like it.
[01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:41.550]  Do you have any brands you need to shout out
[01:10:41.550 --> 01:10:42.870]  or anybody that is sponsoring you
[01:10:42.870 --> 01:10:45.470]  that you need to support while you're on here?
[01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:48.030]  Another shout out to Starfire Edibles for sure.
[01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:49.230]  Nom, nom, nom, nom, nom.
[01:10:49.230 --> 01:10:52.710]  Yeah, I mean, Jazz is just the bomb.
[01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:55.510]  I can't speak highly enough of her.
[01:10:55.510 --> 01:11:00.510]  And Dank Essence, CBD infused bath bombs as well.
[01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:02.870]  Bath bombs.
[01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:03.710]  Yeah.
[01:11:03.710 --> 01:11:05.830]  Is there a reason for a dude to use a bath bomb?
[01:11:05.830 --> 01:11:08.190]  You might like them, actually.
[01:11:08.190 --> 01:11:09.030]  Yeah, so.
[01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.870]  All right.
[01:11:09.870 --> 01:11:10.710]  Yeah.
[01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:12.150]  I have a bath bomb company, hook me up.
[01:11:12.150 --> 01:11:13.470]  I had a product test them.
[01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:15.030]  So don't judge a guy.
[01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:15.870]  You product tested them?
[01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:17.630]  Did you make one of the videos like all the girls do?
[01:11:18.270 --> 01:11:19.110]  You got one, Brad?
[01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.950]  Just turn to the camera, I'll cue it.
[01:11:19.950 --> 01:11:20.790]  And put the bath bomb video in it.
[01:11:20.790 --> 01:11:22.830]  I had a product test some that we made at our company.
[01:11:22.830 --> 01:11:24.390]  Oh, I thought you meant a Dank Essence one.
[01:11:24.390 --> 01:11:29.390]  Dank Essence, I actually, I gave some to my girlfriend.
[01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:30.670]  Dank Essence?
[01:11:30.670 --> 01:11:33.070]  Not Dank Essence, another bath bomb though.
[01:11:33.070 --> 01:11:34.070]  Oh, okay.
[01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:36.190]  And girls love them.
[01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:39.350]  I think actually, I've tried many of them.
[01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:43.350]  I do like Dank Essence because they are high in CBDs.
[01:11:43.350 --> 01:11:47.390]  And to me, okay, because the grumpy grandpa's sick,
[01:11:48.190 --> 01:11:49.030]  I gotta do yard work and stuff.
[01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:50.670]  Sometimes I hurt.
[01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:51.510]  Relaxing.
[01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:54.550]  Old school, I used to just soak with some Epsom salt.
[01:11:54.550 --> 01:11:58.510]  Now I use these bath bombs and they work.
[01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:01.390]  Colorado Springs, young men of Colorado Springs,
[01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:02.990]  you dab dudes, you're sitting on the couch
[01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:04.390]  on a fucking Saturday taking dabs,
[01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:06.510]  watching Dabbing Granny do videos.
[01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:07.590]  Go do our yard work.
[01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:08.630]  Go mow her lawn for her.
[01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:09.590]  Go pick up the trash.
[01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:11.030]  Go pick up the leaves.
[01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:12.710]  Just hit her up on Instagram, say Dabbing Granny,
[01:12:12.710 --> 01:12:13.830]  I'm gonna come clean your front lawn
[01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:14.670]  because Ross and Jeff said so,
[01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:16.350]  and I'm a respectful young man.
[01:12:16.350 --> 01:12:19.670]  There's no need for you to be out there cleaning up.
[01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:21.910]  You're too awesome to be out there cleaning shit up.
[01:12:21.910 --> 01:12:23.830]  Some young man, you ain't doing shit, dude.
[01:12:23.830 --> 01:12:24.830]  Get up off the couch.
[01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:26.270]  Go help out the Dabbing Granny.
[01:12:26.270 --> 01:12:28.270]  And then after that, go help out someone else's granny
[01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:29.990]  and clean up some fucking leaves, clean up their yard.
[01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.830]  Help somebody out.
[01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:33.510]  Do you know I always end my YouTubes every morning
[01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.350]  by saying make the best day you possibly can.
[01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:40.230]  Do your own personal best.
[01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.870]  And always try and do a kind deed for somebody
[01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:45.230]  because you'll feel good at the end of the day.
[01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:49.030]  I see no reason to not end this podcast on that.
[01:12:49.030 --> 01:12:49.870]  Not at all.
[01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:50.710]  I think we're all just gonna do a mic drop.
[01:12:50.710 --> 01:12:52.750]  Someone else is kinda like, we ain't killing it.
[01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:56.070]  Oh man, Kabuki J. Fox just called in on FaceTime.
[01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:57.270]  Somebody put your mic up to him.
[01:12:57.270 --> 01:12:58.110]  I can't hear him from here.
[01:12:58.110 --> 01:13:00.910]  You know I wanna meet you so bad.
[01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.230]  Ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:07.070]  We have to talk, you and I, okay?
[01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:08.790]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[01:13:08.790 --> 01:13:10.350]  All right.
[01:13:10.350 --> 01:13:11.950]  Right?
[01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:13.990]  So Kabuki J. Fox just happens to call right
[01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.870]  as we're recording.
[01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:15.710]  That's so awesome.
[01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:17.310]  Kabuki, you gave me a gift the other day
[01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:18.150]  and I appreciate it.
[01:13:18.150 --> 01:13:19.670]  Thank you, brother.
[01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:21.950]  He threw me a peace sign and said I'm welcome at any time.
[01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:22.790]  So that's awesome.
[01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:25.470]  Shout out to Kabuki J. Fox and his CBD medicine.
[01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:31.430]  He is great with the CBDs I always talk about.
[01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:36.430]  I see his Instagram pictures and I salivate.
[01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:38.390]  Guys, I love each and every one of you.
[01:13:38.390 --> 01:13:40.070]  Thanks for joining me on the podcast.
[01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.910]  This is fucking awesome.
[01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:41.750]  Look forward to coming back.
[01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:42.590]  Thank you.
[01:13:42.590 --> 01:13:43.430]  Big shout out to the Canyon Canyon.
[01:13:43.590 --> 01:13:44.430]  Oh, you're welcome, man.
[01:13:44.430 --> 01:13:45.510]  Thanks for joining us on the podcast.
[01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:46.830]  I was glad to find out you're coming.
[01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:47.670]  I heard you're coming.
[01:13:47.670 --> 01:13:48.510]  Somebody told me you're coming.
[01:13:48.510 --> 01:13:49.350]  I was like, that's gonna be rad
[01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:50.190]  because Sam's cool.
[01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:52.150]  I've heard a lot of cool shit about you already.
[01:13:52.150 --> 01:13:52.990]  Thank you very much.
[01:13:52.990 --> 01:13:53.830]  It was a great time.

[01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:05.510]  because the hash is spinning around the table.
[01:15:05.510 --> 01:15:07.150]  Everyone's getting excited.

[01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:34.950]  for about five minutes there.
[01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:36.350]  I tried to fix it the best I could.
