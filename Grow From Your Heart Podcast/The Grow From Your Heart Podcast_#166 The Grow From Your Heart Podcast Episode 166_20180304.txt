[00:00.890 --> 00:43.010]  I'm your host, my friends, call me Ross DeGeffa, and I thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.010 --> 00:45.890]  As always, I want to give a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:45.890 --> 00:48.170]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.170 --> 00:51.410]  Big thanks to Kat Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:51.410 --> 00:55.130]  Also congratulations on the little one that's coming up soon, you guys.
[00:55.130 --> 00:56.130]  I'm proud of you.
[00:56.130 --> 00:57.130]  I'm excited for you.
[00:57.130 --> 00:58.130]  Much love in that family.
[00:58.130 --> 01:00.970]  A whole bunch of positive folks in that family.
[01:00.970 --> 01:02.210]  You guys, I'm proud of Lindsay also.
[01:02.210 --> 01:04.730]  Across the table, she just mouthed the entire intro perfectly.
[01:04.730 --> 01:05.890]  You've nailed it two or three times now.
[01:05.890 --> 01:06.890]  I'm proud of you.
[01:06.890 --> 01:09.050]  I send you videos all the time of me nailing it.
[01:09.050 --> 01:14.570]  Oh my God, you sent me a video of us face swapped doing the video and I almost had a
[01:14.570 --> 01:15.570]  nervous breakdown.
[01:15.570 --> 01:17.050]  It was the weirdest thing I'd ever seen.
[01:17.050 --> 01:19.330]  It was creepy as fuck for some reason.
[01:19.330 --> 01:20.770]  It's my favorite video.
[01:20.770 --> 01:21.770]  Oh my God.
[01:21.770 --> 01:22.770]  All right, let's do some introductions.
[01:22.770 --> 01:23.770]  I saw it.
[01:23.770 --> 01:24.770]  LOL.
[01:24.770 --> 01:25.770]  You saw it?
[01:25.770 --> 01:28.050]  Ladies and gentlemen, that lovely voice you just heard to the left of me is the dabbing
[01:28.050 --> 01:29.050]  granny.
[01:29.050 --> 01:30.050]  Welcome back to the show, honey.
[01:30.050 --> 01:31.050]  Thanks, Jeff.
[01:31.050 --> 01:32.530]  Hey, thanks for driving all the way from Colorado Springs to Pueblo to join us.
[01:32.530 --> 01:33.930]  Oh my God, it's so far.
[01:33.930 --> 01:35.610]  We're not going to have any tech issues.
[01:35.610 --> 01:36.970]  No tech issues this time.
[01:36.970 --> 01:38.290]  I did not take any gear.
[01:38.530 --> 01:39.530]  We're doing it at the home studio.
[01:39.530 --> 01:40.530]  Everything works beautifully.
[01:40.530 --> 01:41.530]  I love it.
[01:41.530 --> 01:42.530]  It's great.
[01:42.530 --> 01:43.530]  Thank you for coming.
[01:43.530 --> 01:47.330]  Granny brought an Easter basket filled with turps, hash.
[01:47.330 --> 01:48.530]  Everybody at the table got a gift.
[01:48.530 --> 01:52.330]  People that are not at the table that are going to be here later got gifts.
[01:52.330 --> 01:55.850]  She's got green crack terpenes.
[01:55.850 --> 01:59.170]  She has got sleeping monkey hash.
[01:59.170 --> 02:01.010]  There is some Panama punch on the table.
[02:01.010 --> 02:02.010]  There's some blue dream.
[02:02.010 --> 02:03.010]  Turpy slurpy.
[02:03.010 --> 02:04.930]  There's some blue dream over here.
[02:04.930 --> 02:06.570]  We had a little conversation about the blue dream.
[02:06.570 --> 02:07.930]  There was some solventless hash.
[02:08.570 --> 02:09.570]  There was some Clementine.
[02:09.570 --> 02:13.490]  I was gifted a sweet new pencil dabber from our friend Tater Glass.
[02:13.490 --> 02:15.290]  It is a UV reactive.
[02:15.290 --> 02:16.290]  It's clear.
[02:16.290 --> 02:17.290]  It's UV reactive on one end.
[02:17.290 --> 02:21.290]  It has got like a cobalt baby blue, which is actually honestly one of my favorite colors.
[02:21.290 --> 02:23.810]  If you know much about me, the tip has got some blue in it.
[02:23.810 --> 02:26.650]  It's also already got a little piece of hair in the reclaim that stuck to it.
[02:26.650 --> 02:29.170]  I don't know how our lives are so hairy, but that's how it goes.
[02:29.170 --> 02:32.690]  So shout out to Tater Glass and Granny for hooking me up with this sweet new pencil dabber.
[02:32.690 --> 02:33.690]  I love it.
[02:33.690 --> 02:34.690]  It's beautiful.
[02:34.690 --> 02:35.690]  Thank you guys.
[02:35.690 --> 02:36.690]  I'm glad you like it.
[02:36.690 --> 02:37.690]  I love it.
[02:38.450 --> 02:41.090]  It's similar to my daughter's eyes color, but honestly, that was one of my favorite
[02:41.090 --> 02:42.850]  colors before she even was born.
[02:42.850 --> 02:45.090]  I'm glad I got to show you the UV.
[02:45.090 --> 02:46.330]  Yes, that was awesome.
[02:46.330 --> 02:50.170]  Granny carries around a UV light, you guys, so that if you've got UV reflective glass,
[02:50.170 --> 02:51.570]  it's a new reactive glass.
[02:51.570 --> 02:52.570]  It's a new thing.
[02:52.570 --> 02:53.570]  We talked about it on the show.
[02:53.570 --> 02:56.210]  It's pretty much a black light, but you hold the rig underneath this little light Granny's
[02:56.210 --> 03:00.250]  got and if it's got UV in there, Illuminati glass, it will glow.
[03:00.250 --> 03:01.250]  It's dope as fuck.
[03:01.250 --> 03:02.250]  I love it.
[03:02.250 --> 03:03.370]  I can't believe she carries that around.
[03:03.370 --> 03:06.930]  She's got a literal Easter basket full of treats.
[03:07.170 --> 03:08.170]  It's Granny's basket.
[03:08.170 --> 03:09.170]  Granny's basket.
[03:09.170 --> 03:10.170]  I love it.
[03:10.170 --> 03:11.170]  I love it.
[03:11.170 --> 03:12.170]  Shout out for coming all the way from Springs.
[03:12.170 --> 03:13.170]  I appreciate that.
[03:13.170 --> 03:14.170]  I did.
[03:14.170 --> 03:15.170]  Thanks.
[03:15.170 --> 03:16.170]  Also in front of me is a lovely traveling stoner, Miss Lindsey.
[03:16.170 --> 03:17.170]  Welcome back, Boo Boo.
[03:17.170 --> 03:18.170]  Thank you for having me.
[03:18.170 --> 03:19.170]  Always.
[03:19.170 --> 03:20.170]  I told you you could be on the next one.
[03:20.170 --> 03:21.170]  Yes.
[03:21.170 --> 03:23.170]  And then over here, a quiet guy, but he'll talk a couple times.
[03:23.170 --> 03:24.170]  Yes, yes.
[03:24.170 --> 03:25.170]  Hello, hello.
[03:25.170 --> 03:26.170]  Mr. Bobo Blastico, also known as Chris.
[03:26.170 --> 03:27.170]  What up, everyone?
[03:27.170 --> 03:30.170]  The traveling stoner's better half, the one that keeps you in line.
[03:30.170 --> 03:32.170]  Check, keep her in check somehow.
[03:32.170 --> 03:33.170]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:33.410 --> 03:38.410]  Also, follow Bobo Blastico on Instagram because he has started making glass gnome carb caps.
[03:38.410 --> 03:40.410]  Yeah, I'm starting to dabble in the glass game.
[03:40.410 --> 03:42.410]  Yeah, dude, you are a hell of an artist.
[03:42.410 --> 03:44.410]  You were a tattooist before I knew you.
[03:44.410 --> 03:46.410]  Yeah, I've been doing art for a long time.
[03:46.410 --> 03:47.410]  You've got that art thing.
[03:47.410 --> 03:48.410]  I do all types of crap.
[03:48.410 --> 03:49.410]  Yeah, you paint.
[03:49.410 --> 03:52.410]  I do a lot of clay sculpting.
[03:52.410 --> 03:56.410]  So glass is kind of like second nature, but it's really fun and really interesting.
[03:56.410 --> 03:57.410]  You're good at it, bro.
[03:57.410 --> 03:59.410]  I see you excelling quickly, so good work.
[03:59.410 --> 04:00.410]  Thank you.
[04:00.410 --> 04:01.410]  That's what everybody keeps telling me.
[04:01.650 --> 04:03.650]  Little homie gnomies he's making.
[04:03.650 --> 04:05.650]  Yeah, and you just started a glass account.
[04:05.650 --> 04:06.650]  Yeah, I did.
[04:06.650 --> 04:11.650]  Yeah, check out at gnome, N-O-M-E, glass.
[04:11.650 --> 04:12.650]  All right, gnome glass.
[04:12.650 --> 04:13.650]  Check it out, you guys.
[04:13.650 --> 04:17.650]  Follow him because he makes cool glass, little gnome carb caps.
[04:17.650 --> 04:18.650]  We got some cool ideas for him, too.
[04:18.650 --> 04:19.650]  There's stuff coming up in the future.
[04:19.650 --> 04:21.650]  Watch the progress.
[04:21.650 --> 04:25.650]  Jump in now while he's new and then you can see him get better and better and better.
[04:25.650 --> 04:27.650]  Yo, is that a gaba glass pen that you're rocking there?
[04:27.650 --> 04:28.650]  That is.
[04:28.650 --> 04:29.650]  Dude, that is dope.
[04:29.650 --> 04:30.650]  That is sweet.
[04:30.890 --> 04:31.890]  I don't know how to say it.
[04:31.890 --> 04:32.890]  I believe it's goba.
[04:32.890 --> 04:33.890]  I'll give you goba.
[04:33.890 --> 04:34.890]  I believe it's goba.
[04:34.890 --> 04:35.890]  I like to say gaba.
[04:35.890 --> 04:36.890]  I don't know.
[04:36.890 --> 04:37.890]  I know Joey.
[04:37.890 --> 04:38.890]  I'll put in Butcher's name right now.
[04:38.890 --> 04:41.650]  He's wearing a pendant that actually has cannabis seeds inside of it and then it's got a little
[04:41.650 --> 04:42.650]  bee on the outside.
[04:42.650 --> 04:43.650]  Yeah, they're encapsulated.
[04:43.650 --> 04:44.650]  They're lemon scum seeds.
[04:44.650 --> 04:45.650]  Lemon cross seeds.
[04:45.650 --> 04:46.650]  Nice.
[04:46.650 --> 04:47.650]  Nice.
[04:47.650 --> 04:48.650]  I've got one with silver 99 seeds in it.
[04:48.650 --> 04:49.650]  Nice.
[04:49.650 --> 04:50.650]  It doesn't have the drips or the stuff on it.
[04:50.650 --> 04:52.650]  It's just the straight up pendant with the seeds.
[04:52.650 --> 04:53.650]  Yeah, these are nice.
[04:53.650 --> 04:58.650]  These are nice little pinata pendants because worst comes to worst, if it breaks, you have
[04:58.650 --> 04:59.650]  to buy a present afterwards.
[04:59.650 --> 05:00.650]  Like, oh, it's bad luck.
[05:00.650 --> 05:02.650]  But like, oh, or it's a good end of the world scenario.
[05:02.650 --> 05:07.650]  If you're on a flight and you crash and you're on an island, now you've got cannabis seeds.
[05:07.650 --> 05:08.650]  That's all I need.
[05:08.650 --> 05:09.650]  That's all you need.
[05:09.650 --> 05:10.650]  That's all I need.
[05:10.650 --> 05:12.650]  If I land on a fucking deserted island that's got some a little bit of water nearby that
[05:12.650 --> 05:16.650]  I can take the salt out of and we got some soil that I can put some salts into, bro,
[05:16.650 --> 05:18.650]  we can make this happen.
[05:18.650 --> 05:21.650]  I am never leaving the house without that pendant again.
[05:21.650 --> 05:24.650]  One thing, if it's got a hole in it, because I'm pretty sure it's got a hole in it because
[05:24.650 --> 05:28.650]  the way that he makes his glass, don't wear it in the shower because your seeds will germinate.
[05:28.650 --> 05:29.650]  Oh man.
[05:29.650 --> 05:30.650]  For real?
[05:30.650 --> 05:33.650]  Well, all that moisture, the humidity in the shower, you'll get water in there eventually.
[05:33.650 --> 05:36.650]  And it just takes a little tiny bit of water to germinate some seeds.
[05:36.650 --> 05:38.650]  And that'll be a warm place.
[05:38.650 --> 05:41.650]  That'd be cool to see, to actually watch, to see what it would do.
[05:41.650 --> 05:43.650]  See it somehow try to grow out of it.
[05:43.650 --> 05:46.650]  All right, Joey, you got to send us another one so that we can...
[05:46.650 --> 05:48.650]  We'll have a science project here.
[05:48.650 --> 05:52.650]  I'll just get some seeds and put them in a vial and poke a little hole in it and we'll
[05:52.650 --> 05:53.650]  watch what happens.
[05:53.650 --> 05:55.650]  All right, let's do a podcast, you guys.
[05:55.650 --> 05:57.650]  Today is cause for celebration.
[05:57.650 --> 05:59.650]  I was going to say we should all take a dab.
[05:59.650 --> 06:00.650]  You guys take a dab.
[06:00.650 --> 06:01.650]  I'll keep talking.
[06:01.650 --> 06:05.650]  Today is the dabbing granny's one year anniversary.
[06:05.650 --> 06:06.650]  Yes, it is.
[06:06.650 --> 06:08.650]  I've been on social media for one year.
[06:08.650 --> 06:09.650]  I forgot about this.
[06:09.650 --> 06:12.650]  I find it quite amazing that you have come this far in one year.
[06:12.650 --> 06:15.650]  How many Instagram followers have you got?
[06:15.650 --> 06:18.650]  This morning, it was 215,000.
[06:18.650 --> 06:21.650]  You guys, you didn't hear the microphone smack against my forehead.
[06:21.650 --> 06:22.650]  Let me do it a little harder.
[06:22.650 --> 06:24.650]  Yes, 215,000.
[06:24.650 --> 06:26.650]  It makes no sense to me.
[06:26.650 --> 06:27.650]  That's amazing.
[06:27.650 --> 06:28.650]  In one year.
[06:28.650 --> 06:29.650]  Yeah, in a year.
[06:29.650 --> 06:30.650]  I had an account with 19,000.
[06:30.650 --> 06:32.650]  It got deleted and now I'm almost back to 10,000.
[06:32.650 --> 06:35.650]  So I would give myself credit for 25,000 followers.
[06:35.650 --> 06:36.650]  You know what I'm saying?
[06:36.650 --> 06:37.650]  Yeah, that's a nice solid.
[06:37.650 --> 06:38.650]  She's got 10 times what I've got.
[06:38.650 --> 06:39.650]  That's awesome.
[06:39.650 --> 06:40.650]  But it's not just...
[06:40.650 --> 06:42.650]  It's people from all over the world.
[06:42.650 --> 06:43.650]  Yeah.
[06:43.650 --> 06:47.650]  When I was doing the Periscope, I did a gram dab for celebration.
[06:47.650 --> 06:48.650]  Come on, watch me on Periscope.
[06:48.650 --> 06:49.650]  You took a gram dab at around...
[06:49.650 --> 06:50.650]  Did you see...
[06:50.650 --> 06:51.650]  It was around 420 this afternoon, wasn't it?
[06:51.650 --> 06:52.650]  Yeah, it was.
[06:52.650 --> 06:56.650]  Did you see the person came in from Russia talking, you know,
[06:56.650 --> 06:58.650]  we're so glad Trump is the president, you know,
[06:58.650 --> 07:00.650]  if there would have been World War, if Hillary...
[07:00.650 --> 07:05.650]  And I was like, I know your leader really felt that way and okay,
[07:05.650 --> 07:11.650]  but I think it's amazing that people from Russia come to watch the dabbing granny dab.
[07:11.650 --> 07:13.650]  Yeah, that is pretty amazing.
[07:13.650 --> 07:15.650]  So you took a gram dab at 420.
[07:15.650 --> 07:18.650]  Here it is, 820 right now, and you're in damn good shape.
[07:18.650 --> 07:19.650]  Well, thank you.
[07:19.650 --> 07:20.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[07:20.650 --> 07:23.650]  I've been dabbing since about 6 o'clock this morning.
[07:23.650 --> 07:26.650]  I saw your video this morning when you were talking about you were excited to come be on the podcast.
[07:26.650 --> 07:27.650]  That was early this morning.
[07:27.650 --> 07:29.650]  That's when you replied to one of my Instagram messages.
[07:29.650 --> 07:30.650]  Yep, yep.
[07:30.650 --> 07:32.650]  So, yeah, this lady can dab, you guys.
[07:32.650 --> 07:33.650]  She can keep up with you.
[07:33.650 --> 07:34.650]  She can probably out dab you.
[07:34.650 --> 07:37.650]  She probably has more terps and better terps than you do.
[07:37.650 --> 07:38.650]  She showed up with the gifts too.
[07:38.650 --> 07:39.650]  I mean, you can't beat that.
[07:39.650 --> 07:42.650]  So one year, are you on YouTube?
[07:42.650 --> 07:44.650]  I am on YouTube.
[07:44.650 --> 07:48.650]  I don't have a huge following on YouTube, but I have a very loyal following.
[07:49.650 --> 07:51.650]  It's like Granny's Reality TV.
[07:51.650 --> 07:54.650]  They ask a lot of questions about my family and stuff.
[07:54.650 --> 07:59.650]  So they know that I've evolved, and I don't have an hour every morning to wake and bake.
[07:59.650 --> 08:07.650]  So if I do a YouTube once a week, they're happy to have my little presence there, and I just find it incredible.
[08:07.650 --> 08:10.650]  Can my listeners find you just by searching for Dabbing Granny?
[08:10.650 --> 08:11.650]  Yeah.
[08:11.650 --> 08:16.650]  I think it's dabbing on most of my social medias are dabbing underscore granny.
[08:16.650 --> 08:17.650]  All right.
[08:17.650 --> 08:23.650]  So I'm on YouTube, Periscope, Instagram, Facebook.
[08:23.650 --> 08:26.650]  And I'm liking Facebook again, and people are finding me.
[08:26.650 --> 08:29.650]  I like that live streaming, and I like the intimacy of Facebook.
[08:29.650 --> 08:32.650]  Like Periscope, my room fills up pretty quickly.
[08:32.650 --> 08:34.650]  A couple hundred people real quickly.
[08:34.650 --> 08:37.650]  Facebook might be 10, 15 people.
[08:37.650 --> 08:38.650]  Okay.
[08:38.650 --> 08:40.650]  And we can have nice conversations there.
[08:40.650 --> 08:43.650]  But you know the people on Facebook is what I like better about the Facebook Live.
[08:43.650 --> 08:44.650]  I don't yet.
[08:44.650 --> 08:45.650]  Oh, okay.
[08:45.650 --> 08:47.650]  I'm sure there are more people on Periscope because I've been doing it longer.
[08:47.650 --> 08:50.650]  I only have Facebook friends on my Facebook account.
[08:50.650 --> 08:52.650]  It's mostly people that I know personally that I've hung out with.
[08:52.650 --> 08:54.650]  So when I go Facebook Live, it's all my bros.
[08:54.650 --> 08:55.650]  It's these guys.
[08:55.650 --> 08:56.650]  Cheers.
[08:56.650 --> 08:57.650]  And so that's a lot of fun.
[08:57.650 --> 08:58.650]  No, not for me.
[08:58.650 --> 08:59.650]  Happy one year.
[08:59.650 --> 09:00.650]  That's a one-year dab right there happening.
[09:00.650 --> 09:01.650]  Thanks.
[09:01.650 --> 09:02.650]  Oh, look at it.
[09:02.650 --> 09:03.650]  Look at my friend, the Traveling Stoner.
[09:03.650 --> 09:04.650]  She's got a nice chunky dab there.
[09:04.650 --> 09:05.650]  She's throwing a carb cap on.
[09:05.650 --> 09:07.650]  She's hitting the sweet rig from our friends at Elevate Glass.
[09:07.650 --> 09:12.650]  Big shout-out to our friend Becca and everybody over at Elevate Glass, all the lovely Elevate dolls.
[09:12.650 --> 09:14.650]  I'm going to share a secret about the Traveling Stoner and I.
[09:14.650 --> 09:15.650]  Uh-oh.
[09:15.650 --> 09:16.650]  Yes, I'm going to.
[09:16.650 --> 09:17.650]  She's like, oh, what the hell?
[09:17.650 --> 09:18.650]  I bet it's on my list.
[09:18.650 --> 09:19.650]  Oh, my God.
[09:19.650 --> 09:20.650]  It's on my list of notes.
[09:20.650 --> 09:22.650]  For Breast Cancer Month.
[09:22.650 --> 09:23.650]  Here we go.
[09:23.650 --> 09:26.650]  The Traveling Stoner and I went and had our nipples pierced.
[09:26.650 --> 09:27.650]  Yes, we did.
[09:27.650 --> 09:31.650]  It was probably one of the most painful things I've been through in a while.
[09:31.650 --> 09:38.650]  So these lovely ladies went and got their nipples pierced to raise awareness for breast cancer, you guys.
[09:38.650 --> 09:39.650]  That is some dedication.
[09:39.650 --> 09:40.650]  These are some badass women.
[09:41.650 --> 09:45.650]  I'll tell you, this is truly, I didn't do it for like, oh, let's go get a tattoo or a piercing.
[09:45.650 --> 09:49.650]  This is the way I thought about it because I know some people that have breast cancer.
[09:49.650 --> 09:54.650]  And I thought it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month and somebody shared some stories with me.
[09:54.650 --> 09:56.650]  And I thought, you know what?
[09:56.650 --> 10:03.650]  If you have breast cancer and you're going through chemotherapy, god dang, life probably sucks and every day is a battle.
[10:03.650 --> 10:09.650]  Just having your mammogram done is an uncomfortable experience for any woman.
[10:09.650 --> 10:10.650]  It just is.
[10:10.650 --> 10:11.650]  You go get your boobs squished?
[10:11.650 --> 10:12.650]  Yeah.
[10:12.650 --> 10:13.650]  I've heard about that.
[10:13.650 --> 10:14.650]  And so I was like, come on, Lindsay, let's do it.
[10:14.650 --> 10:16.650]  What's a few minutes of pain compared to some?
[10:16.650 --> 10:18.650]  How do they do it if you don't have a boob?
[10:18.650 --> 10:20.650]  Like if you're lacking in the boob region, what do they squish?
[10:20.650 --> 10:21.650]  I don't know.
[10:21.650 --> 10:22.650]  What do they go for?
[10:22.650 --> 10:24.650]  Like for mammograms, you mean?
[10:24.650 --> 10:25.650]  Yeah.
[10:25.650 --> 10:26.650]  I know I just took a weird turn on this.
[10:26.650 --> 10:27.650]  I was just like, well, how do you?
[10:27.650 --> 10:29.650]  I thought you were talking about for the piercing for a second.
[10:29.650 --> 10:30.650]  No, no, no.
[10:30.650 --> 10:31.650]  It's not through the boob.
[10:31.650 --> 10:32.650]  It's through the nipple.
[10:32.650 --> 10:33.650]  Yeah, no, god, oh, Jesus.
[10:33.650 --> 10:34.650]  That's what I was like.
[10:34.650 --> 10:36.650]  Just went right through the whole thing.
[10:40.650 --> 10:42.650]  You're higher than me.
[10:42.650 --> 10:44.650]  It's been a long day.
[10:44.650 --> 10:45.650]  Okay, sorry, yo.
[10:45.650 --> 10:47.650]  I did not mean to throw you off course there.
[10:47.650 --> 10:48.650]  You were on a path.
[10:48.650 --> 10:50.650]  Now I lost my train of thought.
[10:50.650 --> 10:51.650]  So we did it because.
[10:51.650 --> 10:53.650]  You didn't want to go get a tattoo or.
[10:53.650 --> 10:55.650]  No, I didn't want to get a tattoo.
[10:55.650 --> 10:56.650]  I mean, really, I didn't.
[10:56.650 --> 10:58.650]  And I will share something personal.
[10:58.650 --> 11:01.650]  I've been married to my husband for over 40 years.
[11:01.650 --> 11:03.650]  Almost 45.
[11:03.650 --> 11:06.650]  I know my husband very well.
[11:07.650 --> 11:09.650]  I knew he would not approve.
[11:09.650 --> 11:12.650]  Some of you would be like, oh, but wouldn't every man like their woman's nipples pierced?
[11:12.650 --> 11:15.650]  No, my husband is very conservative about your body.
[11:15.650 --> 11:17.650]  So I didn't tell him.
[11:17.650 --> 11:19.650]  He knew I was hanging out with Lindsay.
[11:19.650 --> 11:22.650]  He knew what was going on, but I did not tell him.
[11:22.650 --> 11:26.650]  And I thought if I tell him immediately, he'll say, take him out.
[11:26.650 --> 11:28.650]  So I waited a few days.
[11:28.650 --> 11:30.650]  And he knows how bad a piercing hurts.
[11:30.650 --> 11:32.650]  So this is how I told him.
[11:32.650 --> 11:34.650]  He was sitting in his chair.
[11:35.650 --> 11:38.650]  And I had fun band-aids, didn't I, Traveling Stoner?
[11:38.650 --> 11:40.650]  I saw the band-aids.
[11:40.650 --> 11:46.650]  So I put on, I had little round sad face emoji band-aids.
[11:46.650 --> 11:53.650]  And it was kind of graphic, but the round part fits over a woman's areola perfectly.
[11:53.650 --> 11:56.650]  And so he was sitting in his chair, and I said, I have something to tell you.
[11:56.650 --> 11:58.650]  And he said, what?
[11:58.650 --> 12:01.650]  I said, oh, my God, I know you're not going to like it.
[12:01.650 --> 12:05.650]  And he was like, what did you do now?
[12:05.650 --> 12:10.650]  And I lifted my shirt, and there was them two sad faces looking at him.
[12:10.650 --> 12:15.650]  And he said, you are not 25 years old like those kids you're hanging out with.
[12:15.650 --> 12:18.650]  And I said, but it was to raise breast cancer awareness.
[12:18.650 --> 12:20.650]  He said, I don't want to hear your rationalization.
[12:20.650 --> 12:22.650]  No, I don't like it.
[12:22.650 --> 12:24.650]  But, yeah, it does look kind of cute.
[12:24.650 --> 12:28.650]  And then it's a win-win for everybody.
[12:28.650 --> 12:29.650]  That's right.
[12:29.650 --> 12:31.650]  I wouldn't let me give her a hug for like a week and a half.
[12:31.650 --> 12:34.650]  I wouldn't let anybody.
[12:34.650 --> 12:36.650]  They hurt, didn't they, Lindsay?
[12:36.650 --> 12:38.650]  I wanted to sleep on the couch for a week.
[12:38.650 --> 12:43.650]  Every, like, the dogs and, like, even the sheets would get you.
[12:43.650 --> 12:44.650]  No.
[12:44.650 --> 12:45.650]  Guess what happened to me?
[12:45.650 --> 12:48.650]  Wait, too fast, too fast, slow.
[12:48.650 --> 12:52.650]  The other day I was putting on a onesie really fast, and I zipped it up.
[12:52.650 --> 12:54.650]  And I was like, oh, my God.
[12:54.650 --> 12:55.650]  And Chris was like, oh, I saw that.
[12:55.650 --> 12:57.650]  That would hurt.
[12:57.650 --> 12:59.650]  And then a German shepherd jumped up on me.
[12:59.650 --> 13:02.650]  I got a titty twister.
[13:02.650 --> 13:07.650]  Just when the left one was almost healed and it was like 360.
[13:07.650 --> 13:09.650]  Oh, gosh.
[13:09.650 --> 13:10.650]  All right.
[13:10.650 --> 13:11.650]  On to the next subject.
[13:11.650 --> 13:13.650]  I might need a dab after all of this.
[13:13.650 --> 13:14.650]  We got so far.
[13:14.650 --> 13:17.650]  When we were talking about Periscope and stuff, I was going to mention,
[13:17.650 --> 13:19.650]  like, you put a lot of your life out there, aren't you?
[13:19.650 --> 13:21.650]  Like, don't you want to keep anything to yourself?
[13:21.650 --> 13:23.650]  But I don't even need to ask that question because you don't give a shit.
[13:23.650 --> 13:24.650]  No, I don't.
[13:24.650 --> 13:25.650]  What have I really got to do?
[13:25.650 --> 13:26.650]  You know, secrets are bad.
[13:26.650 --> 13:28.650]  That means something dirty or bad.
[13:28.650 --> 13:32.650]  And I don't think anything I've done in my life is really dirty or bad.
[13:32.650 --> 13:35.650]  Everything's been a learning experience, and I'll share it with you.
[13:35.650 --> 13:37.650]  And hopefully you'll learn.
[13:37.650 --> 13:38.650]  I was young and dumb once.
[13:38.650 --> 13:41.650]  I did some stupid things that young and dumb people do.
[13:41.650 --> 13:43.650]  Dumb, not dung.
[13:43.650 --> 13:45.650]  And I'll share that with you.
[13:45.650 --> 13:48.650]  Hopefully you'll learn from the things I say because I do have a lot of
[13:48.650 --> 13:50.650]  experience behind me.
[13:50.650 --> 13:52.650]  Well, I'll try to learn.
[13:52.650 --> 13:53.650]  You know exactly what I mean.
[13:53.650 --> 13:54.650]  I do.
[13:54.650 --> 13:55.650]  I do.
[13:55.650 --> 13:58.650]  Yeah, well, being a podcaster, and I also used to put myself on Periscope
[13:58.650 --> 14:01.650]  a lot, I don't seem to be – I don't like sitting down as much.
[14:01.650 --> 14:03.650]  I like to be on my feet doing shit.
[14:03.650 --> 14:06.650]  Periscope makes me feel like I get anxious for some reason afterward.
[14:06.650 --> 14:08.650]  Well, it depends on how much you're dabbing.
[14:08.650 --> 14:09.650]  Right, right.
[14:09.650 --> 14:11.650]  Well, I look up and it's been like 20 or 30 minutes, and I'm like,
[14:11.650 --> 14:14.650]  oh, shit, I only meant to spend five minutes here.
[14:14.650 --> 14:15.650]  Time does get away quickly.
[14:15.650 --> 14:16.650]  It flies.
[14:16.650 --> 14:17.650]  Yeah.
[14:17.650 --> 14:20.650]  But putting that much of myself out, I'm accountable for what I say.
[14:20.650 --> 14:23.650]  I can't fib at all because however many listeners were listening,
[14:23.650 --> 14:25.650]  listened, and it's on record.
[14:25.650 --> 14:27.650]  And every episode is available.
[14:27.650 --> 14:29.650]  Like I've said before, I'm going to start putting out old episodes,
[14:29.650 --> 14:30.650]  even repeating them.
[14:30.650 --> 14:33.650]  Have you learned that the power of your words,
[14:33.650 --> 14:36.650]  you really sometimes have to stop and think?
[14:36.650 --> 14:37.650]  Yes.
[14:37.650 --> 14:40.650]  Because people take things literally.
[14:40.650 --> 14:43.650]  I'm really lucky that I had a starter podcast.
[14:43.650 --> 14:47.650]  I had another friend that had kind of a comedy-slash-community-based podcast.
[14:47.650 --> 14:48.650]  Shout out to Wade Ridley, you guys.
[14:48.650 --> 14:49.650]  Check out Wade Ridley.
[14:49.650 --> 14:50.650]  He's a comedian.
[14:50.650 --> 14:51.650]  We had a podcast together.
[14:52.650 --> 14:54.650]  And I kind of got to be his co-host,
[14:54.650 --> 14:58.650]  so I got to say a couple of dumb things on episodes and realize, oh,
[14:58.650 --> 15:00.650]  I can't say that kind of dumb shit.
[15:00.650 --> 15:02.650]  Like you have to figure it out.
[15:02.650 --> 15:04.650]  But that's how I learned it was by fucking it up.
[15:04.650 --> 15:06.650]  That's why I was laughing when I said, I'll try to learn from you.
[15:06.650 --> 15:08.650]  But, I mean, the way I learned, I have to fall and crash.
[15:08.650 --> 15:10.650]  I have to go, damn, that sucked.
[15:10.650 --> 15:12.650]  Then I'll try to learn from that one.
[15:12.650 --> 15:16.650]  I've learned I'm very accountable for the things I say because so many people
[15:16.650 --> 15:17.650]  do watch me.
[15:17.650 --> 15:18.650]  We have to be.
[15:18.650 --> 15:22.650]  You said something on your social media this morning about when you become as
[15:22.650 --> 15:25.650]  known as you are, you weigh more than myself.
[15:25.650 --> 15:27.650]  But everybody at this table has a little bit of notice.
[15:27.650 --> 15:29.650]  But you've got ten times what we've got.
[15:29.650 --> 15:32.650]  When you get to your level of insta-celebrity or insta-famous.
[15:32.650 --> 15:33.650]  I called it insta-famous.
[15:33.650 --> 15:35.650]  Yeah, it's slightly insta-famous.
[15:35.650 --> 15:39.650]  You've got to pay attention to what you say and who you talk to and what you
[15:39.650 --> 15:40.650]  share.
[15:40.650 --> 15:41.650]  And what you get caught up in.
[15:41.650 --> 15:42.650]  Yes, yes.
[15:42.650 --> 15:43.650]  What you are so sad.
[15:43.650 --> 15:44.650]  Absolutely.
[15:44.650 --> 15:47.650]  It's so much easier to get caught up in shit when you've got 250,000 people
[15:47.650 --> 15:48.650]  in your ear.
[15:48.650 --> 15:50.650]  Just in our cannabis community alone.
[15:50.650 --> 15:52.650]  Just in this small community.
[15:52.650 --> 15:53.650]  Absolutely.
[15:53.650 --> 15:54.650]  I catch myself in it.
[15:54.650 --> 15:55.650]  I catch myself.
[15:55.650 --> 15:58.650]  Everybody's choosing sides all the time in this industry.
[15:58.650 --> 16:00.650]  And it seems like we're all just a bunch of potheads having fun.
[16:00.650 --> 16:01.650]  That's how it should be.
[16:01.650 --> 16:02.650]  It should be.
[16:02.650 --> 16:03.650]  And we should all be united.
[16:03.650 --> 16:05.650]  There shouldn't be any backstabbing.
[16:05.650 --> 16:08.650]  And I don't have time for pettiness.
[16:08.650 --> 16:09.650]  No, no.
[16:09.650 --> 16:10.650]  We're getting too old.
[16:10.650 --> 16:12.650]  These kids are too old for that shit too already.
[16:12.650 --> 16:15.650]  And I think all these young people will learn.
[16:16.650 --> 16:20.650]  Jeff, maybe you said something shitty about Bobo Blaster over there.
[16:20.650 --> 16:21.650]  That was mean.
[16:21.650 --> 16:22.650]  Granny.
[16:22.650 --> 16:24.650]  He's just a rotten person.
[16:24.650 --> 16:28.650]  Well, I'm learning that some of these kids will take what you said to heart.
[16:28.650 --> 16:32.650]  Bobo Blaster over there might be a damn good person, but you have a personal
[16:32.650 --> 16:36.650]  vendetta because some girl you liked, he liked.
[16:36.650 --> 16:39.650]  He said, she said bullshit.
[16:39.650 --> 16:42.650]  No, I'm messing up his glass business and taking money off of their table.
[16:42.650 --> 16:43.650]  And I'm just using you as an example.
[16:43.650 --> 16:44.650]  You know that.
[16:44.650 --> 16:45.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[16:45.650 --> 16:46.650]  Chris is awesome.
[16:46.650 --> 16:47.650]  We have no beef ever.
[16:47.650 --> 16:51.650]  So unless somebody's done me wrong, you can gossip and talk about somebody
[16:51.650 --> 16:52.650]  all you want.
[16:52.650 --> 16:55.650]  Rest assured, Granny is not going to listen to your bullshit.
[16:55.650 --> 16:59.650]  I'm old enough and wise enough to make my own decisions about people.
[16:59.650 --> 17:02.650]  You told me earlier that you just trust your gut and you're 90% of the time
[17:02.650 --> 17:04.650]  you're right is what I think you said.
[17:04.650 --> 17:05.650]  I agree with that.
[17:05.650 --> 17:07.650]  My gut usually is a pretty good judge of what I should and shouldn't do with
[17:07.650 --> 17:08.650]  other folks.
[17:08.650 --> 17:10.650]  I think Lindsey's the same way.
[17:10.650 --> 17:11.650]  Secrets don't make friends, you guys.
[17:11.650 --> 17:12.650]  What's happening over there?
[17:12.650 --> 17:14.650]  I was just asking if he'd eat up the nail for me.
[17:14.650 --> 17:15.650]  Relax.
[17:15.650 --> 17:17.650]  He actually passed me a dab, so I'm going to grab the e-nail here and I'm
[17:17.650 --> 17:18.650]  going to take a dab.
[17:18.650 --> 17:19.650]  What kind of hash did you just give me?
[17:19.650 --> 17:21.650]  That was some Terp Slurpee.
[17:21.650 --> 17:22.650]  Some Terp Slurpee.
[17:22.650 --> 17:23.650]  I am in.
[17:23.650 --> 17:24.650]  I'm in.
[17:24.650 --> 17:27.650]  So these lovely ladies, yeah?
[17:27.650 --> 17:29.650]  That's why they call it Terp Slurpee.
[17:29.650 --> 17:32.650]  These lovely ladies, the dabbing Granny and the lovely traveling stoner here,
[17:32.650 --> 17:38.650]  they came because they are going to do a food drive slash new toy drive.
[17:38.650 --> 17:39.650]  New toys, you guys.
[17:39.650 --> 17:40.650]  New toys in packages for kids.
[17:40.650 --> 17:41.650]  We'll give you an age range.
[17:41.650 --> 17:43.650]  I'll let these ladies handle it while I take this dab.
[17:43.650 --> 17:49.650]  But would one of you ladies like to tell me all about your food and toy drive?
[17:49.650 --> 17:50.650]  Go ahead.
[17:50.650 --> 17:52.650]  You talk for a while, Lins.
[17:52.650 --> 17:53.650]  Okay.
[17:53.650 --> 17:59.650]  So we have set up a food and toy drive here in Colorado Springs.
[17:59.650 --> 18:03.650]  So far we have 17 different places as drop-off points.
[18:04.650 --> 18:12.650]  And at each of those locations you'll be able to get some sort of special deal
[18:12.650 --> 18:16.650]  or offer or something for bringing in either a canned food,
[18:16.650 --> 18:22.650]  excuse me, a non-expired canned food or non-perishable canned food.
[18:22.650 --> 18:23.650]  Right.
[18:23.650 --> 18:24.650]  Something y'all would eat.
[18:24.650 --> 18:26.650]  No expired garbanzo beans.
[18:26.650 --> 18:28.650]  And if you like garbanzo beans, I'm sorry.
[18:29.650 --> 18:34.650]  Or like Jeff said, a brand new toy in a packaging.
[18:34.650 --> 18:36.650]  Any age range, honestly.
[18:36.650 --> 18:38.650]  We don't care.
[18:38.650 --> 18:39.650]  You know, a toy is a toy.
[18:39.650 --> 18:42.650]  We're not going to put a limit on it like that.
[18:42.650 --> 18:47.650]  But, yeah, if you bring in an item to one of the places that we'll list off,
[18:47.650 --> 18:52.650]  you can get a – and each place is doing something different,
[18:52.650 --> 18:59.650]  so you'll have to ask the specific place what they're going to do for it.
[18:59.650 --> 19:00.650]  Okay.
[19:00.650 --> 19:04.650]  But we'll have a flyer and everything for it that we'll be posting
[19:04.650 --> 19:07.650]  and stuff with each place that we have.
[19:07.650 --> 19:15.650]  So we have 17 places right now confirmed, and we have three spots open for places.
[19:15.650 --> 19:21.650]  Yeah, we decided to keep it at 20 because we are going to be the ones that will be
[19:21.650 --> 19:24.650]  going by the dispensaries, picking stuff up.
[19:24.650 --> 19:29.650]  I have a warehouse to store things in until we distribute them.
[19:29.650 --> 19:32.650]  And I think we picked a good organization.
[19:32.650 --> 19:36.650]  We wanted to somehow keep it in the cannabis community,
[19:36.650 --> 19:40.650]  but this year on such short notice that's just not going to happen.
[19:40.650 --> 19:45.650]  So what we have decided to do is I got in contact with the Marion House,
[19:45.650 --> 19:47.650]  and the Marion House is down on Bijou,
[19:47.650 --> 19:51.650]  and they feed and they clothe a lot of our homeless community.
[19:51.650 --> 19:53.650]  And to me that's a lot of veterans,
[19:53.650 --> 20:00.650]  and it's also a lot of young people moving here because of cannabis.
[20:00.650 --> 20:02.650]  You see a lot of young people down there.
[20:02.650 --> 20:03.650]  Yes.
[20:03.650 --> 20:05.650]  So I reached out to them.
[20:05.650 --> 20:08.650]  They will be happy to take anything we have.
[20:08.650 --> 20:12.650]  And then their second organization under the Marion House is called
[20:12.650 --> 20:17.650]  Family Resource Center, and they deal with families that are totally displaced,
[20:17.650 --> 20:21.650]  homeless families that they're getting set up in apartments and stuff.
[20:21.650 --> 20:25.650]  And these are why we're saying we'll take toys because there's children involved
[20:25.650 --> 20:27.650]  in most of these cases.
[20:27.650 --> 20:31.650]  And so that's why we decided, you know, so many people think,
[20:31.650 --> 20:34.650]  oh, people that smoke cannabis, they're bad.
[20:34.650 --> 20:35.650]  They don't do anything.
[20:35.650 --> 20:36.650]  Well, guess what?
[20:36.650 --> 20:37.650]  You're wrong.
[20:37.650 --> 20:39.650]  We love giving back to our community.
[20:39.650 --> 20:41.650]  Yes, and we want to start small this year.
[20:41.650 --> 20:43.650]  We just want to do it in Colorado Springs,
[20:43.650 --> 20:46.650]  but we're hoping to have a really big turnout this year and be able to make it
[20:46.650 --> 20:48.650]  into something even bigger for next year,
[20:48.650 --> 20:52.650]  whether that means we stay in the springs and just make it bigger next year,
[20:52.650 --> 20:55.650]  or we, you know, try to do something even bigger.
[20:55.650 --> 20:58.650]  But we're really excited about this.
[20:58.650 --> 21:02.650]  And the different places you want to list off the different places that we have?
[21:02.650 --> 21:04.650]  I'm just going to throw one more thing in there.
[21:04.650 --> 21:07.650]  Now, at first we were just going to do, we had talked about money and stuff,
[21:07.650 --> 21:08.650]  and we decided no.
[21:08.650 --> 21:12.650]  But what we are going to do, all the different places that, the 20 places,
[21:12.650 --> 21:15.650]  we're going to put a gallon mason jar there,
[21:15.650 --> 21:17.650]  and you can drop off gift certificates.
[21:17.650 --> 21:21.650]  Because like I say, the Family Resource Center, say we get enough,
[21:21.650 --> 21:25.650]  a meal together, we get everything for their, and this is for Christmas,
[21:25.650 --> 21:27.650]  we get their Christmas meal together.
[21:27.650 --> 21:29.650]  What if they don't have a roasting pan?
[21:29.650 --> 21:30.650]  Guess what?
[21:30.650 --> 21:34.650]  The Family Resource Center can say, here, take this gift certificate,
[21:34.650 --> 21:36.650]  go get what else you need for.
[21:36.650 --> 21:40.650]  Or, I think the other thing we might want to include is diapers.
[21:40.650 --> 21:41.650]  Yeah.
[21:41.650 --> 21:44.650]  I mean, diapers are really, really expensive.
[21:44.650 --> 21:45.650]  Yeah.
[21:45.650 --> 21:46.650]  Yeah, they are.
[21:46.650 --> 21:50.650]  So I think we could expand, you know, the toy, diaper, and food.
[21:50.650 --> 21:51.650]  Yeah, absolutely.
[21:51.650 --> 21:53.650]  Lindsay's looking at me like, God, we didn't discuss this.
[21:53.650 --> 21:54.650]  No, I know.
[21:54.650 --> 21:55.650]  I'm like, I just had a thought.
[21:55.650 --> 21:57.650]  I'm so, I, I.
[21:57.650 --> 21:59.650]  As long as we're doing good things, right?
[21:59.650 --> 22:04.650]  Yeah, I'm, listen, anything that's not like expired or bad,
[22:04.650 --> 22:07.650]  or something we really couldn't donate, like, don't be ridiculous.
[22:07.650 --> 22:09.650]  Please don't bring us, like, you know.
[22:09.650 --> 22:13.650]  Go get, go to the health food store and get some of that Amy's organic chili.
[22:13.650 --> 22:15.650]  Get some soups, shit that people want to eat.
[22:15.650 --> 22:18.650]  Like, something that you can actually open and consume,
[22:18.650 --> 22:20.650]  instead of like some green beans.
[22:20.650 --> 22:22.650]  I mean, you can do that, but who wants fucking green beans for dinner?
[22:22.650 --> 22:25.650]  Go get some soup, some Campbell's Good shit, some Chunky shit.
[22:25.650 --> 22:26.650]  Yeah.
[22:26.650 --> 22:27.650]  Like some, yeah, I'm a vegetarian,
[22:27.650 --> 22:29.650]  so I'm going to get some of that fucking veggie soup.
[22:29.650 --> 22:30.650]  But go get the meaty soup.
[22:30.650 --> 22:31.650]  These are, we got to feed people.
[22:31.650 --> 22:32.650]  That's the idea here.
[22:32.650 --> 22:34.650]  Well, then those gift certificates can be used.
[22:34.650 --> 22:36.650]  Like, we're just doing non-perishables, but you need milk.
[22:36.650 --> 22:37.650]  You need butter.
[22:37.650 --> 22:38.650]  You need eggs.
[22:38.650 --> 22:39.650]  Yeah, just, there you go.
[22:39.650 --> 22:40.650]  That's what we'll do.
[22:40.650 --> 22:41.650]  A Walmart gift card.
[22:41.650 --> 22:42.650]  Yep.
[22:42.650 --> 22:43.650]  Yeah.
[22:43.650 --> 22:44.650]  That's where that's going to come in.
[22:44.650 --> 22:45.650]  A grocery gift card.
[22:45.650 --> 22:46.650]  If we had more time,
[22:46.650 --> 22:48.650]  we could probably solicit grocery stores and stuff for turkeys,
[22:48.650 --> 22:50.650]  but this year, not this year.
[22:50.650 --> 22:51.650]  Right.
[22:51.650 --> 22:53.650]  Next year, guys, yep, we're going to make it really, really huge.
[22:53.650 --> 22:54.650]  Yes.
[22:54.650 --> 22:57.650]  Would you prefer them wrap or not wrap the gifts for the kids?
[22:57.650 --> 22:59.650]  I say not wrap.
[22:59.650 --> 23:00.650]  I say don't wrap them, yeah.
[23:00.650 --> 23:01.650]  We'll let the Family Resource Center do that.
[23:01.650 --> 23:03.650]  I think we'll do this and then turn it over to them.
[23:03.650 --> 23:05.650]  Yeah, don't wrap them up, you guys.
[23:05.650 --> 23:07.650]  If you want to donate wrapping paper so that they can be wrapped,
[23:07.650 --> 23:09.650]  go for that, but don't wrap them.
[23:09.650 --> 23:11.650]  I kind of said that because I want to see what's in there so that I make
[23:11.650 --> 23:13.650]  sure you're not giving these kids a box of dicks or something.
[23:13.650 --> 23:14.650]  That's right.
[23:14.650 --> 23:16.650]  And besides that,
[23:16.650 --> 23:18.650]  how do you know that there's not a used toy wrapped up in there?
[23:18.650 --> 23:20.650]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[23:20.650 --> 23:24.650]  Because unfortunately, I would love to think that we're all honest,
[23:24.650 --> 23:26.650]  but we're not.
[23:26.650 --> 23:27.650]  Everybody out there is not honest.
[23:27.650 --> 23:28.650]  Absolutely.
[23:28.650 --> 23:30.650]  That would be a really horrible prank.
[23:30.650 --> 23:32.650]  We're going to distribute the boxes next Friday.
[23:32.650 --> 23:33.650]  Isn't that correct, Lindsay?
[23:33.650 --> 23:34.650]  Sorry.
[23:34.650 --> 23:35.650]  Next Friday.
[23:35.650 --> 23:36.650]  Wasn't that our timeframe?
[23:36.650 --> 23:37.650]  We were going to put them out next Friday.
[23:37.650 --> 23:38.650]  Yes.
[23:38.650 --> 23:39.650]  Collection boxes.
[23:39.650 --> 23:40.650]  So, okay.
[23:40.650 --> 23:41.650]  What will the date be on that Friday?
[23:41.650 --> 23:42.650]  Oh.
[23:42.650 --> 23:43.650]  Uh-oh.
[23:43.650 --> 23:44.650]  Yeah, I know.
[23:44.650 --> 23:46.650]  I done fucked up and asked the date question.
[23:46.650 --> 23:47.650]  Wait a minute.
[23:47.650 --> 23:48.650]  Wait a minute.
[23:48.650 --> 23:49.650]  It's next Friday?
[23:49.650 --> 23:51.650]  The 18th.
[23:51.650 --> 23:53.650]  Okay.
[23:53.650 --> 23:55.650]  And the drop-off no later than December 16th.
[23:55.650 --> 23:57.650]  Yep.
[23:57.650 --> 23:58.650]  Okay.
[23:58.650 --> 24:00.650]  I'm just making notes because I want to make sure that this podcast
[24:00.650 --> 24:01.650]  comes out at the right time.
[24:01.650 --> 24:03.650]  I'll put this out on the 17th.
[24:03.650 --> 24:04.650]  Cool.
[24:04.650 --> 24:05.650]  Okay.
[24:05.650 --> 24:06.650]  Yes.
[24:06.650 --> 24:08.650]  Should I run down the drop-off?
[24:08.650 --> 24:10.650]  And we're thinking about, we haven't fine-tuned this.
[24:10.650 --> 24:12.650]  We're still going to kind of work on it,
[24:12.650 --> 24:16.650]  but we're thinking we could make this into like a little competition.
[24:16.650 --> 24:21.650]  Some of the drop-off spots, one of them being Elevate,
[24:21.650 --> 24:26.650]  already said, well, how about if every place put a little gift in there?
[24:26.650 --> 24:28.650]  She said, I'll throw something in.
[24:28.650 --> 24:34.650]  And then at the end, the person that collected the most gets the little prize
[24:34.650 --> 24:36.650]  package from the 20 drop-off spots,
[24:36.650 --> 24:40.650]  and Granny goes and spends a day with them doing something fun at their
[24:40.650 --> 24:42.650]  facility.
[24:42.650 --> 24:44.650]  We could turn this into a fun competition.
[24:44.650 --> 24:45.650]  This should be a lot of fun.
[24:45.650 --> 24:46.650]  Yeah.
[24:46.650 --> 24:47.650]  You could win a date with Granny.
[24:47.650 --> 24:51.650]  You know, and like I know some of the dispensaries are going to go penny,
[24:51.650 --> 24:52.650]  pre-roll.
[24:52.650 --> 24:54.650]  You know, I know that there's already some specials.
[24:54.650 --> 24:55.650]  Right.
[24:55.650 --> 24:56.650]  Okay.
[24:56.650 --> 24:58.650]  So we'll go through the people we have.
[24:58.650 --> 25:00.650]  Like Lindsay said, there's only three spots left.
[25:00.650 --> 25:07.650]  So if you want to fill one of the last three spots, I guess.
[25:07.650 --> 25:08.650]  Got to be in Colorado Springs.
[25:08.650 --> 25:09.650]  Yes, you do.
[25:09.650 --> 25:12.650]  You need to have a place where you can collect canned foods,
[25:12.650 --> 25:14.650]  a high traffic area.
[25:14.650 --> 25:17.650]  You got to be able to participate with the cannabis community and be proud of
[25:17.650 --> 25:18.650]  the cannabis community.
[25:18.650 --> 25:20.650]  If you've got any fear or hatred for the cannabis community,
[25:20.650 --> 25:22.650]  please don't respond to this ad.
[25:22.650 --> 25:24.650]  No, no, no, no, not at all.
[25:24.650 --> 25:26.650]  And we're not going to junk up your facility.
[25:26.650 --> 25:30.650]  If you call and say the box is full, somebody will be there to pick it up.
[25:30.650 --> 25:33.650]  And your lobby or wherever you have the box will not be an eyesore.
[25:33.650 --> 25:36.650]  I promise you that.
[25:36.650 --> 25:40.650]  And it's a win-win situation because you get free publicity on my social
[25:40.650 --> 25:41.650]  media.
[25:41.650 --> 25:43.650]  That's one of the things I was going to say.
[25:43.650 --> 25:46.650]  You have to be okay with Granny publicizing your area, your facility,
[25:46.650 --> 25:48.650]  your store, wherever it is.
[25:48.650 --> 25:51.650]  If it's a head shop, if it's a grow store, if it's a dispensary,
[25:51.650 --> 25:54.650]  if it's a glass shop, I think I said head shop, but I'm high as shit.
[25:54.650 --> 25:55.650]  So I might not have anything.
[25:55.650 --> 26:01.650]  Anywhere that cannabis consumers or counterculture folk millennials may roam.
[26:01.650 --> 26:02.650]  Coffee shop?
[26:02.650 --> 26:03.650]  Yeah.
[26:03.650 --> 26:04.650]  Yeah. Okay.
[26:04.650 --> 26:07.650]  I'm down for anything as long as you're cannabis friendly.
[26:07.650 --> 26:08.650]  Well, I bet you by the time this comes out,
[26:08.650 --> 26:11.650]  you'll have your three slots filled because you are a,
[26:11.650 --> 26:12.650]  you're a networking young lady.
[26:12.650 --> 26:14.650]  That is what I seem to do.
[26:14.650 --> 26:16.650]  Yes. Higher elevation has got to be on your list.
[26:16.650 --> 26:18.650]  Of course. Let me run down the list.
[26:18.650 --> 26:19.650]  Let's hear the 17.
[26:19.650 --> 26:20.650]  Glass grinds.
[26:20.650 --> 26:24.650]  I know they're located down on the South end of town, right?
[26:24.650 --> 26:25.650]  Somewhere off Fillmore.
[26:25.650 --> 26:26.650]  Yeah, off of Fillmore.
[26:26.650 --> 26:31.650]  Then of course, the Traveling Stoners, place of business, green and healthy wellness.
[26:31.650 --> 26:34.650]  Canna Canyon, they're over on old Colorado.
[26:34.650 --> 26:38.650]  The Weed Pimps, they're fun guys.
[26:38.650 --> 26:39.650]  They really are.
[26:39.650 --> 26:41.650]  They make me laugh every time I see them.
[26:41.650 --> 26:45.650]  Elevate and Hemp, there will be a box at both locations.
[26:45.650 --> 26:48.650]  Epic Remedy, there's one down on the circle.
[26:48.650 --> 26:50.650]  They have one up on Academy.
[26:50.650 --> 26:52.650]  Both stores will have a box.
[26:52.650 --> 26:57.650]  Grow Life, Natural Mystics caregivers, they're downtown.
[26:57.650 --> 26:58.650]  What's up, Joey?
[26:58.650 --> 27:01.650]  DBK Glass, the family joint.
[27:01.650 --> 27:04.650]  The Dankery, they're a new dispensary.
[27:04.650 --> 27:06.650]  Can I tell you something funny about the Dankery?
[27:06.650 --> 27:08.650]  I think it's funny.
[27:08.650 --> 27:10.650]  Okay, yes. As long as it's funny and not derogatory.
[27:10.650 --> 27:11.650]  It's not at all derogatory.
[27:11.650 --> 27:12.650]  Excellent. Let's hear it.
[27:12.650 --> 27:17.650]  You know, I once managed a nonprofit on a military installation in Colorado Springs
[27:17.650 --> 27:20.650]  and I was let go because of Dabbing Granny.
[27:20.650 --> 27:25.650]  Nobody there ever talks to me anymore because I smoke cannabis.
[27:25.650 --> 27:27.650]  You made new friends.
[27:27.650 --> 27:29.650]  I've met, well, my life has gotten much better.
[27:29.650 --> 27:32.650]  I mean, I liked what I did, but moxmix.
[27:32.650 --> 27:36.650]  I ran into the Dankery just because it was a new dispensary
[27:36.650 --> 27:38.650]  and I was with one of my friends.
[27:38.650 --> 27:42.650]  They took a picture because they were very happy to see the Dabbing Granny.
[27:43.650 --> 27:47.650]  One of my former volunteers, because I was a volunteer organization,
[27:47.650 --> 27:51.650]  got in touch with me and said,
[27:51.650 --> 27:57.650]  Gail, Gail is my real name, you were at my son's dispensary today.
[27:57.650 --> 27:59.650]  That was just absolutely wonderful.
[27:59.650 --> 28:04.650]  And I said, in almost a year, you're the first person that has reached out to talk to me.
[28:04.650 --> 28:07.650]  And so she was very happy I was at the Dankery.
[28:07.650 --> 28:10.650]  Kind of funny.
[28:10.650 --> 28:12.650]  Luckily people just shunned you.
[28:12.650 --> 28:14.650]  Well, but look at the great friends I've made.
[28:14.650 --> 28:16.650]  That's true. You've replaced them.
[28:16.650 --> 28:17.650]  Oh, yes.
[28:17.650 --> 28:19.650]  Yeah, yeah. Way better company.
[28:19.650 --> 28:20.650]  I think so.
[28:20.650 --> 28:21.650]  Upgrade.
[28:21.650 --> 28:24.650]  Truthfully, people, somebody asked me in one of my comments today,
[28:24.650 --> 28:30.650]  they said, did you ever think at your age you would be this important person in the cannabis community?
[28:30.650 --> 28:32.650]  And I said, no, I pinch myself every morning.
[28:32.650 --> 28:36.650]  I'm like, how can this be? How can this be?
[28:36.650 --> 28:37.650]  I embrace it.
[28:37.650 --> 28:41.650]  No security clearance to get in here. It was easy.
[28:41.650 --> 28:43.650]  What did you do to Lindsay, dude?
[28:43.650 --> 28:45.650]  I didn't do anything. She got her own dab.
[28:45.650 --> 28:47.650]  She set herself up. She heat her own nail.
[28:47.650 --> 28:48.650]  I didn't do anything.
[28:48.650 --> 28:49.650]  Is she in there puking?
[28:49.650 --> 28:52.650]  I don't think she's puking, but I can hear her coughing through the walls.
[28:52.650 --> 28:57.650]  She went on a coughing fit and I don't think she tried to hold it for the mics to not like die in this room.
[28:57.650 --> 28:59.650]  I talked about you earlier.
[28:59.650 --> 29:00.650]  Did your ears ring?
[29:00.650 --> 29:07.650]  Chris said, I watched you do that dab and you just kept going in and you didn't cough.
[29:07.650 --> 29:09.650]  It's so mesmerizing.
[29:09.650 --> 29:11.650]  So you have Jeff to thank for that.
[29:11.650 --> 29:14.650]  I don't even know if you know this.
[29:14.650 --> 29:21.650]  You, when I, I think it might've been the first time we met at the first podcast and we talked about coughing during doing.
[29:21.650 --> 29:25.650]  And you said, well, I very rarely cough because you own your lungs.
[29:25.650 --> 29:27.650]  You can tell them what to do.
[29:27.650 --> 29:38.650]  So when I feel that tickle and you all know what I mean, when I say I feel that tickle, I hear that your voice in my head and I almost meditate with my eyes open that I am not going to cough.
[29:38.650 --> 29:39.650]  Yep.
[29:39.650 --> 29:40.650]  Yeah.
[29:40.650 --> 29:41.650]  Uh, all right.
[29:41.650 --> 29:43.650]  I've never talked about this on a podcast.
[29:43.650 --> 29:45.650]  I've only told like four people in my whole life.
[29:45.650 --> 29:46.650]  This granny was one of them.
[29:46.650 --> 29:47.650]  I take giant dad.
[29:47.650 --> 29:56.650]  You guys, when you feel like you're going to cough, when you feel that thing that goes like you, you blow out the dab and you start to go, you feel that shit when you're, when you're walking at the mall.
[29:56.650 --> 30:00.650]  If you get a little cramp and you're like, you know, just fucking fall down and start to spit.
[30:00.650 --> 30:01.650]  I'm just some of you do.
[30:01.650 --> 30:03.650]  I'm sorry, but you've got a condition.
[30:03.650 --> 30:05.650]  Most people don't just fall down and fucking cannabis.
[30:05.650 --> 30:06.650]  Donald Trump.
[30:06.650 --> 30:13.650]  I was just a second, but most normal folk, if you get a cramp, you don't just fucking fall down and spaz out in the middle of the mall.
[30:13.650 --> 30:14.650]  In my opinion, that's what my lungs are doing.
[30:14.650 --> 30:15.650]  I'm coughing.
[30:15.650 --> 30:17.650]  They're throwing a fit like a fucking mad child to cramp.
[30:17.650 --> 30:22.650]  Uh, I feel that cough coming and I either inhale or exhale as hard as I can distract them.
[30:22.650 --> 30:26.650]  Like when your dog's trying to run away at a cat, you just pull the leash and put a treat in front of it.
[30:26.650 --> 30:27.650]  It forgets about the cat.
[30:27.650 --> 30:28.650]  It looks at the tree and goes, Oh, treat.
[30:28.650 --> 30:29.650]  I liked it.
[30:29.650 --> 30:30.650]  I just breathe in real hard.
[30:30.650 --> 30:31.650]  My lungs like air.
[30:31.650 --> 30:33.650]  So they just suck that in instead of trying to cough.
[30:33.650 --> 30:40.650]  I don't know if that's good for me or bad for me, but it works, but it's got to be better than coughing so hard and blowing out my face and getting red eyed.
[30:40.650 --> 30:43.650]  And I've coughed so hard, blown up fucking blood vessel.
[30:43.650 --> 30:44.650]  Yeah.
[30:44.650 --> 30:46.650]  I get ads when I do cough.
[30:46.650 --> 30:47.650]  You know what I mean?
[30:47.650 --> 30:49.650]  I feel like I do those little cops.
[30:49.650 --> 30:54.650]  That's just a shit cough, but I don't let those, those dead dead core exercise.
[30:54.650 --> 31:00.650]  Every now and again, I've smoked strange product and get wet lungs.
[31:00.650 --> 31:01.650]  A PHO.
[31:01.650 --> 31:02.650]  I don't know what it is.
[31:02.650 --> 31:03.650]  Is that what it is?
[31:03.650 --> 31:04.650]  Yeah.
[31:04.650 --> 31:05.650]  Well, that's in my opinion.
[31:05.650 --> 31:06.650]  When I smoke pH.
[31:06.650 --> 31:07.650]  Yeah.
[31:07.650 --> 31:12.650]  I know that sounds weird to a lot of people in random places, but that you can make quality cannabis concentrates with propane if you do it properly.
[31:12.650 --> 31:15.650]  But it comes out like live resident comes out really moist.
[31:15.650 --> 31:19.650]  And when I smoke it, my lungs feel heavy and I spit up all cough up the next morning.
[31:19.650 --> 31:21.650]  I'll cough up a bright green or a bright yellow.
[31:21.650 --> 31:22.650]  Yes.
[31:22.650 --> 31:23.650]  Golf.
[31:23.650 --> 31:24.650]  Like you're sick.
[31:24.650 --> 31:25.650]  Oh my God.
[31:25.650 --> 31:26.650]  Do I need.
[31:26.650 --> 31:27.650]  But once it comes out, I'm marvelous.
[31:27.650 --> 31:29.650]  But it's wet in your lungs in the morning.
[31:29.650 --> 31:30.650]  Yeah.
[31:30.650 --> 31:31.650]  Yeah.
[31:31.650 --> 31:32.650]  Oh, we should finish our list.
[31:32.650 --> 31:33.650]  Yes.
[31:33.650 --> 31:34.650]  I was going to keep you on the list.
[31:34.650 --> 31:35.650]  I'm sorry.
[31:35.650 --> 31:36.650]  We have 80 hashtag.
[31:36.650 --> 31:37.650]  They like it when we ramble.
[31:37.650 --> 31:40.650]  Back to as, as you always say, let's get back to the podcast.
[31:40.650 --> 31:42.650]  Um, new age medical.
[31:42.650 --> 31:44.650]  I think they're out by garden of the gods.
[31:44.650 --> 31:45.650]  That's a cool name.
[31:45.650 --> 31:46.650]  That's Bailey.
[31:46.650 --> 31:47.650]  Yes.
[31:47.650 --> 31:48.650]  Big shout out to new age medical.
[31:48.650 --> 31:49.650]  Rocky mountain.
[31:49.650 --> 31:50.650]  Yes.
[31:50.650 --> 31:51.650]  Rocky mountain.
[31:51.650 --> 31:52.650]  Dabber.
[31:52.650 --> 31:53.650]  I love her.
[31:53.650 --> 31:54.650]  Tweedleaf.
[31:54.650 --> 31:58.650]  Tweedleaf is really, um, I'm glad they're on board cause they actually once a month wanted to do a charity event.
[31:58.650 --> 32:00.650]  Nobody seemed to want cannabis money.
[32:00.650 --> 32:01.650]  Yeah.
[32:01.650 --> 32:02.650]  That's the hard part about it.
[32:02.650 --> 32:09.650]  We found a groper vets finally took money, but it was really, really hard to find anybody that will take money.
[32:10.650 --> 32:15.650]  The vets always need help and it's always great to help the vets and they'll take it.
[32:15.650 --> 32:22.650]  So if you ever need some more to send stuff, I've got a guy who runs a veteran organization that will always need contributions.
[32:22.650 --> 32:30.650]  Well, she asked me again, can we do once one Saturday a month where 10% of everybody's purchase goes directly to a charity?
[32:30.650 --> 32:33.650]  So shout out to Renee at Tweedleaf.
[32:33.650 --> 32:35.650]  So it's pretty nice dispensary too.
[32:35.650 --> 32:36.650]  I'm sorry, Lindsay.
[32:36.650 --> 32:37.650]  Oh, I love you.
[32:38.650 --> 32:42.650]  I know it's not, it's not yours actually.
[32:42.650 --> 32:43.650]  It's not even that.
[32:43.650 --> 32:44.650]  I don't.
[32:44.650 --> 32:48.650]  But you do know one thing about me is that that sense of loyalty I have, it's just.
[32:48.650 --> 32:50.650]  I go to other dispensaries.
[32:50.650 --> 32:51.650]  It happens.
[32:51.650 --> 32:58.650]  I do primarily shop at green and healthy, but I visit other dispensaries and I go into other places.
[32:58.650 --> 33:00.650]  Like they don't grow every strand in the world.
[33:00.650 --> 33:01.650]  Exactly.
[33:01.650 --> 33:02.650]  Like honestly, like.
[33:02.650 --> 33:03.650]  They don't have the orange.
[33:03.650 --> 33:04.650]  Right.
[33:04.650 --> 33:06.650]  Like I like to go to other places.
[33:06.650 --> 33:07.650]  I like.
[33:07.650 --> 33:08.650]  I just have to.
[33:08.650 --> 33:15.650]  I cannot go to one dispensary because of the different drops and I, and y'all know I've developed great taste buds for different product.
[33:15.650 --> 33:20.650]  I was complimenting you earlier on your, your ability to shop everywhere.
[33:20.650 --> 33:23.650]  That I can recognize concentrates by their containers.
[33:23.650 --> 33:25.650]  You kind of get around in a good way.
[33:25.650 --> 33:26.650]  Yeah.
[33:26.650 --> 33:27.650]  And it's, I enjoy it.
[33:27.650 --> 33:30.650]  I enjoy being able to tell people, you know, this is really good product.
[33:30.650 --> 33:33.650]  Go spend your X amount of dollars.
[33:33.650 --> 33:38.650]  Every day in the late afternoon, around two 30, three o'clock, you can open up Instagram and see where granny decided to shop today.
[33:38.650 --> 33:40.650]  There's one or two shots of her and the cool bud tender there.
[33:40.650 --> 33:41.650]  They would treat her politely.
[33:41.650 --> 33:43.650]  There's always a shot of me on somebody's page.
[33:43.650 --> 33:44.650]  I love it.
[33:44.650 --> 33:45.650]  I love it.
[33:45.650 --> 33:47.650]  When you pop up somewhere random, I'm like, oh, she's at L I can almost tell where you are.
[33:47.650 --> 33:52.650]  Like, oh, she went to elevate and then she had this little, and then she took, yeah, she took grumpy grandpa somewhere.
[33:52.650 --> 33:53.650]  I have a little pass.
[33:53.650 --> 33:54.650]  I go on that.
[33:54.650 --> 33:55.650]  She went to the glass grind.
[33:55.650 --> 33:56.650]  That's funny.
[33:56.650 --> 33:57.650]  All right.
[33:57.650 --> 33:58.650]  All right.
[33:58.650 --> 33:59.650]  Altitude meds.
[33:59.650 --> 34:00.650]  They're downtown.
[34:00.650 --> 34:01.650]  I believe there's several locations.
[34:01.650 --> 34:02.650]  Okay.
[34:02.650 --> 34:03.650]  So we're going to have a little bit of a backyard.
[34:03.650 --> 34:12.650]  We're going to have boxes and all their locations, Emerald city wellness, uh, the pink house and stained glass LLC.
[34:12.650 --> 34:14.650]  So that leaves three spots.
[34:14.650 --> 34:16.650]  Get in touch with me.
[34:16.650 --> 34:19.650]  Uh, DM me on Instagram, dabbing underscore granny.
[34:19.650 --> 34:22.650]  I think those spots will fill up quickly though.
[34:22.650 --> 34:23.650]  And not just the spot.
[34:23.650 --> 34:25.650]  Well, you'll probably have those filled.
[34:25.650 --> 34:27.650]  This comes out in like seven or 10 days from now.
[34:27.650 --> 34:31.650]  So these seven, 10 is a probably be filled up hopefully with much faith.
[34:31.650 --> 34:37.650]  Uh, what we need now is people to go to these locations with a non-perishable canned good that you would eat.
[34:37.650 --> 34:42.650]  You guys that you would put in a pan and heat up yourself and sit down and fucking enjoy like a meal by yourself.
[34:42.650 --> 34:44.650]  It don't bring us a bunch of random side shit.
[34:44.650 --> 34:45.650]  We don't want to feed some people.
[34:45.650 --> 34:46.650]  And you know what?
[34:46.650 --> 34:47.650]  Maybe you're not a big shopper.
[34:47.650 --> 34:49.650]  That's what that Mason jar is going to be for.
[34:49.650 --> 34:50.650]  And guess what?
[34:50.650 --> 34:55.650]  The cannabis community is the most honorable community.
[34:55.650 --> 34:57.650]  You can drop your money in a dispensary.
[34:57.650 --> 34:58.650]  You will get it back.
[34:58.650 --> 35:02.650]  You can leave your badge or your ID behind.
[35:02.650 --> 35:03.650]  Because we're all stoners.
[35:03.650 --> 35:07.650]  And if we drop some shit, we hope that you're going to hand it to me also.
[35:07.650 --> 35:13.650]  Maybe I've just been lucky, but I hear it's pretty, pretty often that people always get back their stuff.
[35:13.650 --> 35:14.650]  Yeah.
[35:14.650 --> 35:15.650]  Yeah.
[35:15.650 --> 35:26.650]  With that said though, if you're broke and all you have in your cabinet is something and all you want to bring, you want to bring something in, like we will take, we will take that.
[35:26.650 --> 35:27.650]  We will take that.
[35:27.650 --> 35:28.650]  Yes.
[35:28.650 --> 35:29.650]  Don't feel like.
[35:29.650 --> 35:30.650]  Right.
[35:30.650 --> 35:31.650]  You can participate.
[35:31.650 --> 35:32.650]  Yes.
[35:32.650 --> 35:35.650]  Please don't feel like we're sitting here and saying, don't bring anything in.
[35:35.650 --> 35:38.650]  Like if you know, like believe me, I've been there.
[35:38.650 --> 35:39.650]  I was in college.
[35:39.650 --> 35:40.650]  Only steak and lobster.
[35:40.650 --> 35:41.650]  Nothing but steak and lobster.
[35:41.650 --> 35:42.650]  But don't bring that.
[35:42.650 --> 35:43.650]  But that.
[35:43.650 --> 35:44.650]  Yeah.
[35:44.650 --> 35:45.650]  But not this.
[35:45.650 --> 35:46.650]  Only steak and lobster in live residence.
[35:46.650 --> 35:51.650]  I was just sitting there thinking like, oh God, three years ago I would have been like, well shit, I'm not bringing anything in.
[35:51.650 --> 35:52.650]  We're just trying to feed.
[35:52.650 --> 35:53.650]  But maybe, you know.
[35:53.650 --> 35:54.650]  I get it.
[35:54.650 --> 35:55.650]  Trying to feed some people.
[35:55.650 --> 36:00.650]  I was one of the people that hopefully was benefiting from our little food drive.
[36:00.650 --> 36:03.650]  The college one.
[36:03.650 --> 36:09.650]  Most people, unfortunately, are right at that line where they don't need the help, but they can't afford to give any help.
[36:09.650 --> 36:10.650]  You know what I'm saying?
[36:10.650 --> 36:12.650]  That's like where most of the folks are right now.
[36:12.650 --> 36:13.650]  Making crucial decisions.
[36:13.650 --> 36:16.650]  Do I need this or do we want to eat at the end of the week?
[36:16.650 --> 36:18.650]  Do you want to wipe my ass or get high this week?
[36:18.650 --> 36:19.650]  This is kind of time to decide.
[36:19.650 --> 36:21.650]  I could walk to work and not get gas.
[36:21.650 --> 36:23.650]  Let's figure this out.
[36:23.650 --> 36:24.650]  What's up?
[36:24.650 --> 36:27.650]  You just gave me a sinking feeling of recreation.
[36:27.650 --> 36:28.650]  Of cannabis.
[36:28.650 --> 36:30.650]  Of impending doom.
[36:30.650 --> 36:36.650]  When you said Medicaid or wipe your butt, I'm afraid that's what Californians are facing.
[36:36.650 --> 36:39.650]  Yeah, I tried to stay out of a lot of the California stuff.
[36:39.650 --> 36:40.650]  I'm sorry you opened it up.
[36:40.650 --> 36:44.650]  Yeah, I see both sides of it and I try to stay.
[36:44.650 --> 36:45.650]  That's California.
[36:45.650 --> 36:46.650]  So Colorado, we did all the things right.
[36:46.650 --> 36:48.650]  We did it right here as usual.
[36:49.650 --> 36:55.650]  We thought that we had lost an initiative here in Pueblo and they are recounting and still counting.
[36:55.650 --> 37:00.650]  And it turns out that we may have actually won three of the four major cannabis initiatives.
[37:00.650 --> 37:05.650]  We may actually get to open recreational cannabis facilities within the city limits of Pueblo before too long here.
[37:05.650 --> 37:06.650]  Lindsey, you want a new job?
[37:06.650 --> 37:07.650]  It'll be fun.
[37:07.650 --> 37:09.650]  We'll both go work in a new dispensary and be bud tenders.
[37:09.650 --> 37:10.650]  It'll be so much fun.
[37:10.650 --> 37:13.650]  Did White Mike have anything to do with this?
[37:13.650 --> 37:16.650]  Was he quite the activist for all the things that were going on?
[37:16.650 --> 37:22.650]  White Mike did a lot of groundwork and a lot of internet work and a lot of podcast work.
[37:22.650 --> 37:25.650]  So, yeah, if you want to give Mike a shout out, he might appreciate that.
[37:25.650 --> 37:26.650]  I've only met him once, but yeah, shout out.
[37:26.650 --> 37:30.650]  Because I listened to your podcast where I gained so much knowledge.
[37:30.650 --> 37:31.650]  I appreciate it.
[37:31.650 --> 37:40.650]  And I've listened to Mike and even though I met him one time in person where he was so quiet, he's not that way on the podcast.
[37:40.650 --> 37:45.650]  He's quiet until he gets a read on you and knows how much of him you want to hear.
[37:45.650 --> 37:46.650]  And then he'll give you enough.
[37:46.650 --> 37:47.650]  He's polite.
[37:47.650 --> 37:52.650]  He was taught to speak when spoken to and shut the fuck up when it's time to shut the fuck up.
[37:52.650 --> 37:55.650]  But he's very knowledgeable about cannabis.
[37:55.650 --> 37:56.650]  He's a smart dude.
[37:56.650 --> 37:57.650]  He's a smart dude.
[37:57.650 --> 37:58.650]  He's passionate about cannabis.
[37:58.650 --> 37:59.650]  So thank you, White Mike.
[37:59.650 --> 38:00.650]  Continue the fight.
[38:00.650 --> 38:01.650]  Yes.
[38:01.650 --> 38:03.650]  We're lucky to have such a good team.
[38:03.650 --> 38:07.650]  We've got growers and we've got activists and we've got city council representatives.
[38:07.650 --> 38:10.650]  We've got glass makers so that we can consume our products.
[38:10.650 --> 38:13.650]  We've got Lindsey over here promoting us and keeping us medicated.
[38:14.650 --> 38:15.650]  Whoa.
[38:15.650 --> 38:18.650]  I don't know what that meant, but that was a bubble fish face.
[38:18.650 --> 38:19.650]  Yeah, that was weird.
[38:19.650 --> 38:20.650]  Just two stone.
[38:20.650 --> 38:21.650]  Leave me alone.
[38:21.650 --> 38:22.650]  Two stone.
[38:22.650 --> 38:23.650]  Oh, no.
[38:23.650 --> 38:24.650]  It might be time to start trolling Lindsey in a minute.
[38:24.650 --> 38:26.650]  I thought you were throwing up from your dab.
[38:26.650 --> 38:27.650]  Oh, no.
[38:27.650 --> 38:28.650]  No, just some coughs.
[38:28.650 --> 38:29.650]  No.
[38:29.650 --> 38:30.650]  Yeah, for real.
[38:30.650 --> 38:31.650]  I took it way too hot.
[38:31.650 --> 38:32.650]  That's what it was.
[38:32.650 --> 38:34.650]  It wasn't even that it was a big dab.
[38:34.650 --> 38:36.650]  And I felt like she got her own dab.
[38:36.650 --> 38:37.650]  She hit her own nail.
[38:37.650 --> 38:38.650]  Oh, no.
[38:38.650 --> 38:39.650]  I was all hurt.
[38:39.650 --> 38:40.650]  Did you do the green crack?
[38:40.650 --> 38:41.650]  No.
[38:41.650 --> 38:42.650]  She killed herself.
[38:42.650 --> 38:45.650]  I don't even remember what I grabbed because I had actually forgotten it was there.
[38:45.650 --> 38:47.650]  It was a big chunk of a whole thing, like two or three things.
[38:47.650 --> 38:48.650]  The dab was fine.
[38:48.650 --> 38:53.650]  It was after I sat here for a second, I was like, ooh, that was really freaking hot.
[38:53.650 --> 38:55.650]  And I was like, that really hurt my chest.
[38:55.650 --> 38:58.650]  And I was like, oh, yeah, I'm going to cough for a while now.
[38:58.650 --> 39:01.650]  You can mic it up in here and you can cough like Mike on the podcast for ten minutes.
[39:01.650 --> 39:03.650]  Nah, I'm not.
[39:03.650 --> 39:05.650]  I just reach over and turn Mike's microphone down when he starts doing it.
[39:05.650 --> 39:07.650]  He gives me the – he points down.
[39:07.650 --> 39:08.650]  And I'm like, I got you, bro.
[39:08.650 --> 39:10.650]  I'll turn that down for a minute.
[39:10.650 --> 39:11.650]  That's funny.
[39:11.650 --> 39:12.650]  That's what friends are for.
[39:12.650 --> 39:13.650]  Yes.
[39:13.650 --> 39:14.650]  All right.
[39:14.650 --> 39:15.650]  So we've got a canned food drive.
[39:15.650 --> 39:16.650]  Toys also, guys.
[39:16.650 --> 39:17.650]  Toys are rad.
[39:17.650 --> 39:19.650]  Bring some toys, some Ninja Turtles or some shit.
[39:19.650 --> 39:21.650]  Something that you'd want to play with.
[39:21.650 --> 39:24.650]  I understand you don't all have a bunch of extra money.
[39:24.650 --> 39:27.650]  This will end – the drop-off date will end December 10th.
[39:27.650 --> 39:29.650]  So you've got nearly a month from the time that this episode comes out.
[39:29.650 --> 39:31.650]  No, December 16th.
[39:31.650 --> 39:32.650]  December – oh, sorry.
[39:32.650 --> 39:33.650]  I just can't read my own damn writing.
[39:33.650 --> 39:34.650]  I'm sorry.
[39:34.650 --> 39:35.650]  That is a six.
[39:35.650 --> 39:36.650]  I will correct that.
[39:36.650 --> 39:38.650]  I cut my finger a couple weeks ago.
[39:38.650 --> 39:39.650]  Remember I talked about it?
[39:39.650 --> 39:41.650]  If we picked it up then, that's a week before Christmas.
[39:41.650 --> 39:46.650]  Get it to these folks over the weekend, and they can distribute it that week of Christmas.
[39:46.650 --> 39:47.650]  Excellent.
[39:47.650 --> 39:48.650]  Make some happy kids.
[39:48.650 --> 39:49.650]  Make some bellies happy.
[39:49.650 --> 39:50.650]  Make some folks happy.
[39:50.650 --> 39:51.650]  Brighten up some holidays.
[39:51.650 --> 39:54.650]  Whatever holiday you celebrate, share some joy.
[39:54.650 --> 39:55.650]  Help some people out.
[39:55.650 --> 39:56.650]  The winter gets cold and shitty here.
[39:56.650 --> 40:04.650]  Just the cold, the snow, the slowness, the fucking – that vibe makes a lot of people depressed and sad anyway.
[40:04.650 --> 40:08.650]  And then you've got a shitty Christmas on top of it if you're not doing well.
[40:08.650 --> 40:09.650]  It really fucks things up.
[40:09.650 --> 40:12.650]  And if you've got kids on top of that, that's just the icing on the damn poor cake.
[40:12.650 --> 40:14.650]  So help some people out.
[40:14.650 --> 40:16.650]  Make them have a little better week.
[40:16.650 --> 40:17.650]  Kids don't know any different.
[40:17.650 --> 40:18.650]  Right.
[40:18.650 --> 40:19.650]  Yeah.
[40:19.650 --> 40:20.650]  Yeah.
[40:20.650 --> 40:21.650]  And if you don't break them early, they get a chance.
[40:21.650 --> 40:23.650]  So try to help them out.
[40:23.650 --> 40:24.650]  I'm serious.
[40:24.650 --> 40:25.650]  I mean, yeah.
[40:25.650 --> 40:26.650]  Yep, you're right.
[40:26.650 --> 40:29.650]  You don't want to raise strippers and serial killers.
[40:29.650 --> 40:30.650]  Or maybe you do.
[40:30.650 --> 40:31.650]  I don't know.
[40:31.650 --> 40:33.650]  Too easy to rip.
[40:33.650 --> 40:35.650]  Granny turned red and blushed.
[40:35.650 --> 40:37.650]  I have never seen Granny blush before.
[40:37.650 --> 40:39.650]  He caught me off guard with that one.
[40:39.650 --> 40:40.650]  I liked it.
[40:42.650 --> 40:43.650]  I apologize.
[40:43.650 --> 40:44.650]  Or Andrew, you're welcome.
[40:47.650 --> 40:53.650]  I wrote down just a one-word note, and I'm going to wait until you get done taking that drink because I don't want you to spray it all over the table.
[40:53.650 --> 40:54.650]  Or all over me.
[40:54.650 --> 40:56.650]  Or all over Lindsay because she's looking right at you.
[40:56.650 --> 40:57.650]  I know.
[40:57.650 --> 40:58.650]  I was like, thank you.
[40:58.650 --> 41:03.650]  The new trend in cannabis that I have been catching on to is the suppositories.
[41:03.650 --> 41:04.650]  You know what?
[41:05.650 --> 41:07.650]  Let's be legitimate.
[41:07.650 --> 41:09.650]  I'm glad you brought that up.
[41:09.650 --> 41:13.650]  May I steal some of your green crack dabs to place on my turps?
[41:13.650 --> 41:14.650]  Thank you, ma'am.
[41:14.650 --> 41:15.650]  You want turps?
[41:15.650 --> 41:16.650]  Where are the turps?
[41:16.650 --> 41:18.650]  Oh, this is going to do me just fine.
[41:18.650 --> 41:21.650]  This green crack turps on the uh, what kind of shatter do I have?
[41:23.650 --> 41:25.650]  This is black cherry maduro.
[41:25.650 --> 41:26.650]  I like this drink.
[41:26.650 --> 41:27.650]  Nice.
[41:27.650 --> 41:28.650]  Okay.
[41:28.650 --> 41:33.650]  When I first heard about them damn suppositories, even I was kind of skeptical.
[41:34.650 --> 41:40.650]  But I have a pretty sick husband so I thought, okay, this is really going to help weaning him off the morphine and all that with this pain.
[41:40.650 --> 41:41.650]  Okay.
[41:41.650 --> 41:45.650]  What I have discovered is most of you men are homophobic.
[41:45.650 --> 41:51.650]  You mentioned suppositories and I see you visibly squeezing your butt cheeks together.
[41:52.650 --> 41:53.650]  She's right.
[41:53.650 --> 41:54.650]  It's true.
[41:54.650 --> 41:55.650]  It's accurate.
[41:55.650 --> 41:56.650]  I don't know why.
[41:56.650 --> 41:58.650]  Women on the other hand, you know.
[41:59.650 --> 42:02.650]  We spit 10 pound babies out our vaginas.
[42:02.650 --> 42:04.650]  So what's a suppository?
[42:04.650 --> 42:06.650]  Lindsay's like, not me.
[42:06.650 --> 42:08.650]  We don't do that over here.
[42:08.650 --> 42:11.650]  Not just like on command or anything?
[42:14.650 --> 42:16.650]  That kind of stuff don't happen in these halls.
[42:16.650 --> 42:20.650]  I took these home for my husband and I was like, look what I brought you.
[42:20.650 --> 42:24.650]  They're 50% THC, 50% CBDs.
[42:24.650 --> 42:25.650]  Thank you.
[42:25.650 --> 42:26.650]  I had a brain fart.
[42:26.650 --> 42:29.650]  And he said, you stick that up your ass.
[42:29.650 --> 42:32.650]  And I was like, no problem.
[42:32.650 --> 42:33.650]  And I did.
[42:34.650 --> 42:40.650]  It is at least 12 hours of euphoria is the best way to put it.
[42:40.650 --> 42:45.650]  You can function, you can drive, you're not intoxicated, but you're euphoric.
[42:46.650 --> 42:51.650]  I used one the night we had our girls taken care of and it eased the pain.
[42:51.650 --> 42:52.650]  Okay.
[42:52.650 --> 42:55.650]  So my thought was, all right, now these things are really wonderful.
[42:55.650 --> 43:02.650]  If you are truly a medical patient, for real, if you're especially cancer patient,
[43:02.650 --> 43:05.650]  if you're vomiting, right.
[43:05.650 --> 43:07.650]  Skip that whole part of the body.
[43:07.650 --> 43:08.650]  Exactly.
[43:08.650 --> 43:13.650]  And you and I know that the divine creator did not make our lungs to ingest irritants.
[43:13.650 --> 43:14.650]  Some of us like to smoke.
[43:14.650 --> 43:16.650]  We know it's really not the best way to medicate.
[43:16.650 --> 43:18.650]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[43:18.650 --> 43:19.650]  I like to smoke though.
[43:19.650 --> 43:24.650]  If you truly need to medicate, there are so many membranes in your body.
[43:24.650 --> 43:26.650]  So many membranes in your anus.
[43:26.650 --> 43:30.650]  Using these suppositories is a wonderful way to medicate.
[43:30.650 --> 43:33.650]  Cannabis isn't the first medicine they've used as a suppository.
[43:33.650 --> 43:34.650]  No.
[43:34.650 --> 43:36.650]  It's just the newest and it's just on our realm.
[43:36.650 --> 43:38.650]  So now it's what we're talking about now.
[43:38.650 --> 43:41.650]  It's been used for, I'm going to say hundreds of years, I'm not certain.
[43:41.650 --> 43:45.650]  But I'm sure people have been boofing things for way longer than before cannabis came out.
[43:45.650 --> 43:47.650]  It is the best way to medicate.
[43:47.650 --> 43:49.650]  So the next week we'll skip.
[43:49.650 --> 43:51.650]  Okay, so I had no problem with it.
[43:51.650 --> 43:52.650]  I stuck one up my butt.
[43:52.650 --> 43:54.650]  I had a couple of them up my butt by now.
[43:54.650 --> 43:57.650]  My husband had to have a colonoscopy the next week and he came home.
[43:57.650 --> 43:59.650]  He was all grumpy after his colonoscopy.
[43:59.650 --> 44:00.650]  He was in pain.
[44:00.650 --> 44:03.650]  He was grouchy and I was like, your butthole's already stretched out.
[44:03.650 --> 44:04.650]  Try one of them suppositories.
[44:04.650 --> 44:09.650]  Oh my God, I'm so glad he does not listen to this podcast.
[44:09.650 --> 44:12.650]  He tried one and he was like, you're right.
[44:12.650 --> 44:15.650]  My lower back pain is gone.
[44:15.650 --> 44:21.650]  I don't feel the nauseousness in my belly that I feel when I take a morphine for pain.
[44:22.650 --> 44:23.650]  Yeah, I'm swimming from that dab.
[44:23.650 --> 44:26.650]  I might have put a little too much Terps, but I'm not complaining.
[44:26.650 --> 44:27.650]  That was not Terps.
[44:27.650 --> 44:28.650]  Oh my God.
[44:28.650 --> 44:30.650]  That is pure green crack distillate.
[44:30.650 --> 44:33.650]  That's like 96% THC.
[44:33.650 --> 44:38.650]  I just put a little line across the dab and it made my brain swim around in my head.
[44:38.650 --> 44:40.650]  I'll tell you something.
[44:40.650 --> 44:42.650]  Should I tell the story about the green crack?
[44:42.650 --> 44:43.650]  Well, of course.
[44:43.650 --> 44:47.650]  Since we're on the boofing topic.
[44:47.650 --> 44:48.650]  Oh my God.
[44:48.650 --> 44:49.650]  Oh no.
[44:49.650 --> 44:50.650]  Okay.
[44:50.650 --> 44:55.650]  We're smoking on this stuff called green crack, which is a pretty sativa dominant strain.
[44:55.650 --> 44:56.650]  Wouldn't you all agree sitting around this?
[44:56.650 --> 44:58.650]  After the dab I just took, absolutely.
[44:58.650 --> 44:59.650]  Okay.
[44:59.650 --> 45:00.650]  Yeah.
[45:00.650 --> 45:01.650]  And I'm not a real sativa person.
[45:01.650 --> 45:03.650]  But you have to tell the-
[45:03.650 --> 45:04.650]  I'm getting there.
[45:04.650 --> 45:05.650]  What it looks like when it comes in.
[45:05.650 --> 45:06.650]  Oh, okay.
[45:06.650 --> 45:08.650]  When you buy this distilled hash, it's solventless.
[45:08.650 --> 45:10.650]  It comes in a little syringe.
[45:10.650 --> 45:11.650]  It's not very big.
[45:11.650 --> 45:12.650]  It's glass.
[45:12.650 --> 45:13.650]  It's glass.
[45:13.650 --> 45:18.650]  It has a very small part where the medicine actually comes out of the syringe, like where
[45:18.650 --> 45:20.650]  a needle would be, I guess, in a syringe.
[45:20.650 --> 45:21.650]  There is no needle on it.
[45:21.650 --> 45:23.650]  The word syringe scares the shit out of people.
[45:23.650 --> 45:24.650]  Oh no, we don't want to say-
[45:24.650 --> 45:26.650]  No, it's literally just a glass syringe.
[45:26.650 --> 45:27.650]  That's it.
[45:27.650 --> 45:32.650]  Maybe if you have children, you've used them for pulling up amoxicillin or an antibiotic
[45:32.650 --> 45:33.650]  to give to your baby.
[45:33.650 --> 45:35.650]  Or if you have pets, you've used them-
[45:35.650 --> 45:37.650]  I was going to say it'd be good to feed a baby bird.
[45:37.650 --> 45:38.650]  It would be ideal.
[45:38.650 --> 45:39.650]  Oh yes.
[45:39.650 --> 45:41.650]  It's probably a really good description to put the idea in people's heads.
[45:41.650 --> 45:42.650]  It'd be perfect to feed a baby bird.
[45:42.650 --> 45:45.650]  Or if you had rodents or mice or something like that.
[45:45.650 --> 45:46.650]  Yeah.
[45:46.650 --> 45:50.650]  So I really do like these suppositories for medicating.
[45:50.650 --> 45:56.650]  And I'm not going to say where, but a butt tender said, well, have you tried that hash?
[45:56.650 --> 45:58.650]  And I was like, no.
[45:58.650 --> 46:01.650]  He said, well, you should try that green crack.
[46:01.650 --> 46:04.650]  Anally, I said, okay.
[46:04.650 --> 46:06.650]  So I went home.
[46:06.650 --> 46:11.650]  I was bouncing up the wall.
[46:11.650 --> 46:14.650]  She squirted an entire gram.
[46:15.650 --> 46:20.650]  So when I went back to that butt tender, I was like, my God, I was bouncing off the walls.
[46:20.650 --> 46:24.650]  Like I had consumed huge amounts of caffeine and lots of other things.
[46:24.650 --> 46:27.650]  And he said, granny, you didn't do the whole gram.
[46:27.650 --> 46:28.650]  Did you?
[46:28.650 --> 46:29.650]  Well, yeah.
[46:29.650 --> 46:31.650]  800 and something milligrams.
[46:31.650 --> 46:32.650]  Yeah.
[46:32.650 --> 46:33.650]  Yeah.
[46:33.650 --> 46:36.650]  That's probably about somewhere between 800 and 900 milligrams.
[46:36.650 --> 46:38.650]  Word from granny, don't try that.
[46:38.650 --> 46:41.650]  That's like when I did all those edibles after the secret sesh.
[46:41.650 --> 46:45.650]  I'm pretty sure you don't have to discourage too many people sticking too much hash in their ass on the show.
[46:45.650 --> 46:49.650]  But if they were to try it, how much of.
[46:49.650 --> 46:51.650]  I really wouldn't suggest doing that.
[46:51.650 --> 46:52.650]  No.
[46:52.650 --> 46:53.650]  No.
[46:53.650 --> 46:54.650]  Okay.
[46:54.650 --> 46:56.650]  I don't think that product's made for that.
[46:56.650 --> 46:57.650]  The suppositories, however.
[46:57.650 --> 46:58.650]  The suppositories.
[46:58.650 --> 46:59.650]  I do them regularly.
[46:59.650 --> 47:00.650]  Okay.
[47:00.650 --> 47:02.650]  I've given some to the traveling stoner.
[47:02.650 --> 47:04.650]  We can ask her what her effect was.
[47:04.650 --> 47:06.650]  I watched her put her head down in blushes while I blinked.
[47:06.650 --> 47:09.650]  But she can't be like, oh, God, she's putting me on the spot like that.
[47:10.650 --> 47:12.650]  Come on, we're talking about true medication.
[47:12.650 --> 47:17.650]  The first time I ever did one, I actually did the Foria ones.
[47:17.650 --> 47:23.650]  So I had gotten the Foria ones as a sample so long ago, and I never used them.
[47:23.650 --> 47:33.650]  And then once Gail started doing them and was talking about them, I was supposed to go to Denver and meet up with one of our friends for her birthday.
[47:34.650 --> 47:39.650]  And I was in a lot of pain that morning, and I was like, shit, I really need to go to Denver.
[47:39.650 --> 47:46.650]  Like, you know, we have plans, and I really can't let this, like, fuck up our plans for her birthday.
[47:46.650 --> 47:49.650]  So I said to Chris, I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[47:49.650 --> 47:52.650]  He's like, you need to put one of those suppositories in and just try it.
[47:52.650 --> 47:55.650]  The first time I ever took one, the Foria ones are a lot stronger.
[47:55.650 --> 47:57.650]  They're like the 50-50 ones.
[47:57.650 --> 48:01.650]  So the first time I ever took it, I was like Gumby.
[48:01.650 --> 48:08.650]  I think because I was in a lot of pain, like I just, like, immediately was out of pain.
[48:08.650 --> 48:09.650]  I don't know. It was weird.
[48:09.650 --> 48:12.650]  But, yeah, like, you can ask Chris.
[48:12.650 --> 48:15.650]  I was like, I couldn't really move my lower half and stuff.
[48:15.650 --> 48:18.650]  She's like, I don't even feel my lower half. I feel great.
[48:18.650 --> 48:19.650]  Nice.
[48:19.650 --> 48:21.650]  But it took care of all that female pain you were having.
[48:21.650 --> 48:23.650]  True, true medication.
[48:23.650 --> 48:25.650]  How long does it take to kick in?
[48:25.650 --> 48:27.650]  Oh, about 15, 20 minutes.
[48:28.650 --> 48:31.650]  Granny gave me some drops, some oral sublingual drops today.
[48:31.650 --> 48:34.650]  And I felt those within like 10 minutes.
[48:34.650 --> 48:39.650]  And they're pretty good for a tincture because a lot of tinctures are very ashy medicine.
[48:39.650 --> 48:45.650]  It was a very clean, almost like a green tea, but very light diluted green tea flavor.
[48:45.650 --> 48:46.650]  I actually enjoyed it.
[48:46.650 --> 48:52.650]  And then Lindsay was kind enough to throw me some of a pumpkin spice bar.
[48:52.650 --> 48:56.650]  Yeah, of course, pumpkin spice, the white girl Incredibles edible.
[48:56.650 --> 48:57.650]  It was delicious.
[48:57.650 --> 48:59.650]  And they're kicking. It's all working.
[48:59.650 --> 49:01.650]  It's all working now.
[49:01.650 --> 49:06.650]  I'm so proud of you that you jumped back on the edible bandwagon.
[49:06.650 --> 49:07.650]  I just needed to clean out.
[49:07.650 --> 49:09.650]  I had to kind of flush the edible system.
[49:09.650 --> 49:10.650]  I went through that.
[49:10.650 --> 49:17.650]  They tallied I ate 5,200 milligrams of edibles the Sunday after the secret session we were at.
[49:17.650 --> 49:18.650]  Oh, my God.
[49:18.650 --> 49:20.650]  It was Max's bacon.
[49:20.650 --> 49:22.650]  Oh, yeah. Shout out to Max.
[49:22.650 --> 49:23.650]  Shout out to Max.
[49:23.650 --> 49:24.650]  And his grill.
[49:24.650 --> 49:26.650]  And then I ate what Granny ate.
[49:26.650 --> 49:27.650]  Damn, Granny.
[49:27.650 --> 49:28.650]  But I didn't stop there.
[49:28.650 --> 49:30.650]  You just kept going?
[49:30.650 --> 49:35.650]  I ate two cookies that were about 500 milligrams each, those lemon ones.
[49:35.650 --> 49:36.650]  Oh, man.
[49:36.650 --> 49:38.650]  But then I didn't stop there.
[49:38.650 --> 49:41.650]  I ate two cupcakes at the Traveling Star.
[49:41.650 --> 49:43.650]  I don't know. What were those?
[49:43.650 --> 49:44.650]  150?
[49:44.650 --> 49:45.650]  What were the cupcakes?
[49:45.650 --> 49:46.650]  I don't even remember those.
[49:46.650 --> 49:48.650]  The strawberry pink cupcakes?
[49:48.650 --> 49:49.650]  You got those fancy.
[49:49.650 --> 49:51.650]  No, that was a different sesh.
[49:51.650 --> 49:54.650]  Oh, my God. Stop, Jeff, because those were amazing.
[49:54.650 --> 49:55.650]  Those were heavenly.
[49:55.650 --> 50:00.650]  Those ones you had gotten, we got the half dozen of the solventless, pretty fancy.
[50:00.650 --> 50:02.650]  Oh, the donuts.
[50:02.650 --> 50:03.650]  What did I say?
[50:03.650 --> 50:04.650]  The cupcakes.
[50:04.650 --> 50:06.650]  Because that's immediately what I thought of.
[50:06.650 --> 50:07.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[50:07.650 --> 50:12.650]  Okay, so at the second secret sesh ever in Colorado, it was in May.
[50:12.650 --> 50:14.650]  You were in Florida.
[50:14.650 --> 50:16.650]  You weren't here for it.
[50:16.650 --> 50:19.650]  You had literally flown out the day before.
[50:19.650 --> 50:21.650]  But he's looking like I know the cupcakes.
[50:21.650 --> 50:23.650]  He saw pictures.
[50:23.650 --> 50:25.650]  No, he looks like he ate the cupcakes.
[50:25.650 --> 50:26.650]  Yeah, he knows the donuts.
[50:26.650 --> 50:31.650]  But, yeah, those strawberry lemonade cupcakes from secret sesh.
[50:31.650 --> 50:38.650]  And it was so funny because Jeff and I both, when I walked in, I was like, we both looked at each other and were like, we're not going to eat edibles.
[50:38.650 --> 50:40.650]  First of all, I found Jeff in the corner.
[50:40.650 --> 50:41.650]  Oh, that's Lucas.
[50:41.650 --> 50:43.650]  Had he already consumed edibles?
[50:43.650 --> 50:44.650]  No, not yet.
[50:44.650 --> 50:49.650]  Adam Hill brought me on stage and gave me a two-gram dab and then asked.
[50:49.650 --> 50:51.650]  Did he do one with you?
[50:51.650 --> 50:53.650]  No, we kind of fixed it.
[50:53.650 --> 50:56.650]  He knows that I like to take big dabs and we're buddies.
[50:56.650 --> 50:59.650]  And he was on stage and he goes, I'm higher than you because that's his thing.
[50:59.650 --> 51:01.650]  He likes to say, I'm higher than you.
[51:01.650 --> 51:02.650]  I'm higher than you.
[51:02.650 --> 51:03.650]  Why?
[51:03.650 --> 51:04.650]  That's my Adam Hill impersonation.
[51:04.650 --> 51:06.650]  And then he grabs his shirt like he's cool.
[51:06.650 --> 51:07.650]  Why?
[51:07.650 --> 51:09.650]  And I pointed at him and I go, no, you're not because I'm taller than him.
[51:09.650 --> 51:10.650]  So I'm always higher.
[51:10.650 --> 51:11.650]  You're much taller than him.
[51:11.650 --> 51:12.650]  Yeah, so I'm always higher.
[51:12.650 --> 51:14.650]  I think even I was taller than I am.
[51:14.650 --> 51:15.650]  Yes, you are.
[51:15.650 --> 51:17.650]  I've got a really killer picture of the two of you in my phone.
[51:17.650 --> 51:18.650]  I'll show you later.
[51:18.650 --> 51:19.650]  Okay.
[51:19.650 --> 51:20.650]  You guys were talking and you didn't know I was taking pictures.
[51:20.650 --> 51:21.650]  I just thought there's two of my favorite people.
[51:21.650 --> 51:22.650]  I just took a picture of you guys.
[51:22.650 --> 51:25.650]  So Adam calls me out.
[51:25.650 --> 51:27.650]  He's like, Jeff, I'm higher than you.
[51:27.650 --> 51:28.650]  Come up on stage.
[51:28.650 --> 51:30.650]  And so fucking, yeah, that's my Adam Hill impersonation.
[51:30.650 --> 51:31.650]  I think it's really fun, right?
[51:31.650 --> 51:32.650]  Yeah, it's really good.
[51:32.650 --> 51:33.650]  It's easy to do.
[51:33.650 --> 51:34.650]  You just plug your nose.
[51:34.650 --> 51:35.650]  I need his glasses.
[51:35.650 --> 51:36.650]  You just plug your nose.
[51:36.650 --> 51:37.650]  And so he comes up and he's like, you think you could take a big dab?
[51:37.650 --> 51:38.650]  And I'm like, I can do a big dab.
[51:39.650 --> 51:40.650]  And he's like, you ready for this?
[51:40.650 --> 51:41.650]  And stretches out two grams.
[51:41.650 --> 51:42.650]  And I was like, ah, shit.
[51:42.650 --> 51:43.650]  I didn't know that's what was coming.
[51:43.650 --> 51:45.650]  And he heated the nail to where it was white.
[51:45.650 --> 51:46.650]  It wasn't red.
[51:46.650 --> 51:47.650]  It was white.
[51:47.650 --> 51:48.650]  And I was like, let it cool.
[51:48.650 --> 51:49.650]  And he goes, nope, just hit it.
[51:49.650 --> 51:50.650]  And I was like, no, let it cool.
[51:50.650 --> 51:52.650]  And so I like hesitated as long as I could.
[51:52.650 --> 51:54.650]  But then I just went in because he was pushing it on there.
[51:54.650 --> 51:57.650]  And I pulled the whole thing and then I blew it out.
[51:57.650 --> 51:58.650]  And he's like, damn, this guy's a champ.
[51:58.650 --> 52:00.650]  And everyone's like, can you do a bigger dab than him?
[52:00.650 --> 52:01.650]  And people are like, yes.
[52:01.650 --> 52:04.650]  And they would come up on stage and we would dab together.
[52:04.650 --> 52:05.650]  You kept dabbing?
[52:05.650 --> 52:06.650]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[52:06.650 --> 52:07.650]  They couldn't finish their dabs.
[52:07.650 --> 52:10.650]  And I would grab the rig from them after I took mine.
[52:10.650 --> 52:11.650]  And finish their dabs.
[52:11.650 --> 52:14.650]  And then I would finish their dab for them and set the rig down like, now what's up?
[52:14.650 --> 52:17.650]  But honestly, that only lasted for one set, he calls it.
[52:17.650 --> 52:21.650]  Adam does like little 45-minute things and then goes and takes a break.
[52:21.650 --> 52:22.650]  Walks around the crowd.
[52:22.650 --> 52:23.650]  One of those.
[52:23.650 --> 52:25.650]  And I had to go sit upstairs and eat.
[52:25.650 --> 52:27.650]  There wasn't real food there at the time.
[52:27.650 --> 52:30.650]  So I ate about 12 bags of chips and like seven bottles of water.
[52:30.650 --> 52:33.650]  Like, I was high.
[52:33.650 --> 52:35.650]  I imagine so.
[52:35.650 --> 52:37.650]  I was really high.
[52:37.650 --> 52:41.650]  That's why I didn't want to do a gram dab in that relay thing we were in.
[52:41.650 --> 52:43.650]  But I wanted to win.
[52:43.650 --> 52:45.650]  So Max heated up my nail and he was like, let it cool.
[52:45.650 --> 52:47.650]  I was like, no, no, I want to win.
[52:47.650 --> 52:48.650]  I'm going to hit it hard.
[52:48.650 --> 52:49.650]  I'm going to hit it hard.
[52:49.650 --> 52:50.650]  Ouch.
[52:50.650 --> 52:51.650]  Yeah.
[52:51.650 --> 52:53.650]  Hot dabs, I go a little hotter than a lot of people.
[52:53.650 --> 52:54.650]  Hot dabs aren't too bad.
[52:54.650 --> 52:55.650]  I'm going to actually move the nail over.
[52:55.650 --> 52:56.650]  He's not lying because I sat down.
[52:56.650 --> 52:58.650]  I'm sitting right in front of the e-nail.
[52:58.650 --> 53:00.650]  It's at the other end of the table.
[53:00.650 --> 53:03.650]  And I was like, is that e-nail that hot?
[53:04.650 --> 53:05.650]  Yes, it is.
[53:05.650 --> 53:07.650]  But everybody's e-nail is different.
[53:07.650 --> 53:08.650]  Yeah.
[53:08.650 --> 53:11.650]  And I don't, it's really not as high.
[53:11.650 --> 53:12.650]  Like, I can keep my hand there.
[53:12.650 --> 53:16.650]  And guys, when you do big dabs like Jeff and I do, the traveling.
[53:16.650 --> 53:19.650]  Yeah, you definitely watch the e-nail struggle when Jeff does that.
[53:19.650 --> 53:23.650]  Yes, because you start dropping it and you see the temperature dropping right with your.
[53:23.650 --> 53:24.650]  It tries to keep up.
[53:24.650 --> 53:25.650]  Yep.
[53:25.650 --> 53:26.650]  Yep.
[53:26.650 --> 53:30.650]  And I hear some of the time, I can hear my dab hardening up on the nail because it's like.
[53:30.650 --> 53:31.650]  Yep.
[53:31.650 --> 53:32.650]  It's like, I can't keep up.
[53:32.650 --> 53:36.650]  You got to either suck harder or slower or turn this thing up.
[53:36.650 --> 53:37.650]  Stop, Lindsay.
[53:39.650 --> 53:40.650]  Bad monkey.
[53:42.650 --> 53:43.650]  Anyways.
[53:43.650 --> 53:44.650]  I see the wheels in your sky turning.
[53:44.650 --> 53:45.650]  Well.
[53:47.650 --> 53:50.650]  It went from suppositories to this really quickly.
[53:50.650 --> 53:52.650]  I don't know how that escalated that way, but I'm really glad that it did.
[53:52.650 --> 53:54.650]  Did you finish your story about suppositories?
[53:54.650 --> 53:56.650]  That you really like them?
[53:56.650 --> 53:57.650]  Yeah, yeah, she got Gumby.
[53:57.650 --> 53:58.650]  Yeah, I got all kinds of Gumby now.
[53:58.650 --> 53:59.650]  She was Gumby and it solved her woman problems.
[53:59.650 --> 54:00.650]  She had a much better day.
[54:00.650 --> 54:02.650]  But now you've figured out a better dosage, haven't you?
[54:02.650 --> 54:03.650]  Yeah, absolutely.
[54:03.650 --> 54:08.650]  Because I mean, we've got the smaller ones now and stuff like that.
[54:08.650 --> 54:09.650]  Not for me.
[54:09.650 --> 54:10.650]  I need the big ones.
[54:10.650 --> 54:11.650]  I'm going to 100, 100.
[54:11.650 --> 54:12.650]  I know you are.
[54:12.650 --> 54:17.650]  Going 100 milligrams of THC and 100 milligrams of CBD in a suppository.
[54:17.650 --> 54:26.650]  100 milligrams of edibles of THC is enough for most people to orally consume and be just fine.
[54:27.650 --> 54:31.650]  I don't get like, oh, I'm high, but I'm like, oh, I'm high off of 100 milligrams.
[54:31.650 --> 54:36.650]  If I eat 100 milligrams and then take dabs like normal, then I'm like, oh, I'm high now.
[54:36.650 --> 54:38.650]  Like right now I'm high because I eat edibles also.
[54:38.650 --> 54:39.650]  Yes.
[54:39.650 --> 54:42.650]  But if just that amount of edibles wouldn't have done it, but the two kind of boost.
[54:42.650 --> 54:44.650]  It's like a turbo makes your high turbo.
[54:44.650 --> 54:45.650]  It just gives you a little boost.
[54:45.650 --> 54:47.650]  It's the actual jump.
[54:47.650 --> 54:51.650]  I know I'm not like a scientist, but I pay attention to the body and I know that kind of stuff.
[54:51.650 --> 54:53.650]  I care about physical stuff.
[54:53.650 --> 54:59.650]  I know how quickly your bum is going to absorb that much medicine and you're going to absorb all of it.
[54:59.650 --> 55:00.650]  You're not going to poop any of it out.
[55:00.650 --> 55:02.650]  Your stomach's not going to destroy any of it.
[55:02.650 --> 55:04.650]  Your liver and kidneys aren't going to ruin it.
[55:04.650 --> 55:06.650]  It's just going to suck all up into you.
[55:06.650 --> 55:12.650]  Now, when I do try that high of a dosage, that will be, you know, for me, that's going to be even high for me.
[55:12.650 --> 55:14.650]  I'm not going anywhere.
[55:14.650 --> 55:15.650]  I'm going to test it out.
[55:15.650 --> 55:20.650]  We Facebook live it after, after you've got it inserted and hands washed.
[55:20.650 --> 55:24.650]  I'll even put on my new outfit that the lady from Louis 420 bought me as a gift.
[55:24.650 --> 55:27.650]  You have so many cool friends to give you so many cool gifts.
[55:27.650 --> 55:28.650]  Okay, now you sit here.
[55:28.650 --> 55:29.650]  You know me.
[55:29.650 --> 55:30.650]  Am I very girly, girly?
[55:30.650 --> 55:32.650]  Well, no, it was a very nice gift, but it's not.
[55:32.650 --> 55:35.650]  Did you call yourself on the last podcast an Iowa corn whore?
[55:35.650 --> 55:36.650]  Yes.
[55:36.650 --> 55:37.650]  Guess what she gave me?
[55:37.650 --> 55:39.650]  I am an Iowa corn whore.
[55:39.650 --> 55:41.650]  But you know what she gave me?
[55:41.650 --> 55:44.650]  A gift bag from Victoria's Secret.
[55:44.650 --> 55:46.650]  But it goes with the new ring.
[55:46.650 --> 55:47.650]  But it wasn't so bad.
[55:47.650 --> 55:49.650]  I looked at it and I was like, really?
[55:49.650 --> 55:51.650]  It's yoga pants.
[55:51.650 --> 55:53.650]  That's not too bad.
[55:53.650 --> 55:57.650]  No, and a thing that says U.S. Army and gold sequins.
[55:57.650 --> 55:58.650]  Bling.
[55:58.650 --> 56:00.650]  It's okay.
[56:00.650 --> 56:02.650]  Trying to pull you back to your team.
[56:02.650 --> 56:04.650]  But it's just the Victoria's Secrets.
[56:04.650 --> 56:06.650]  It was like, what is that?
[56:06.650 --> 56:09.650]  Yeah, that's, that's, you're a jeans and t-shirt kind of lady.
[56:09.650 --> 56:13.650]  When I told Tater that he is, I said, I've never been in a Victoria's Secrets.
[56:13.650 --> 56:14.650]  And you know what he said?
[56:14.650 --> 56:17.650]  Unfortunately, I've been in many, many of them.
[56:17.650 --> 56:19.650]  Can you say that too, Jeff?
[56:19.650 --> 56:20.650]  No, I've been there. I've totally been there.
[56:20.650 --> 56:21.650]  How about you, Chris?
[56:21.650 --> 56:22.650]  No.
[56:22.650 --> 56:23.650]  No.
[56:23.650 --> 56:25.650]  Well, this is my thought on Victoria's Secrets.
[56:25.650 --> 56:26.650]  Truthfully.
[56:27.650 --> 56:29.650]  I think they're very expensive.
[56:29.650 --> 56:30.650]  It is expensive.
[56:30.650 --> 56:32.650]  And naked always worked for me.
[56:32.650 --> 56:34.650]  So why do you need these fancy thongs and shit?
[56:34.650 --> 56:36.650]  Yeah, I'm just going to pull that shit off anyway.
[56:36.650 --> 56:37.650]  Really, honest to God.
[56:37.650 --> 56:38.650]  So why, yeah.
[56:38.650 --> 56:40.650]  Unless you're strutting around in your heels.
[56:40.650 --> 56:41.650]  Oh, baby.
[56:42.650 --> 56:43.650]  You just don't need that shit.
[56:43.650 --> 56:45.650]  I'd rather buy medicine.
[56:45.650 --> 56:50.650]  Guys, I wish you could have seen the animation that went along with the boys.
[56:50.650 --> 56:51.650]  I dropped my pen and shit.
[56:51.650 --> 56:52.650]  Everything went wrong.
[56:52.650 --> 56:53.650]  That was great.
[56:54.650 --> 56:55.650]  Relax over there, Jeff.
[56:55.650 --> 56:57.650]  So Granny gets tons of great gifts is something I mentioned.
[56:57.650 --> 57:00.650]  But she's a karmic gift person.
[57:00.650 --> 57:05.650]  She brought me, I've got a Frisbee that is full of other gifts.
[57:05.650 --> 57:08.650]  Like, yeah, so she's a good karmic.
[57:08.650 --> 57:09.650]  She doesn't just get gifts, guys.
[57:09.650 --> 57:10.650]  She does give them back.
[57:10.650 --> 57:12.650]  Yes, she's always, always giving us back.
[57:12.650 --> 57:14.650]  She's always got a basket full of candy.
[57:14.650 --> 57:16.650]  So if you take dabs and you're sitting there looking like you're depleted,
[57:16.650 --> 57:18.650]  she's like, you want some Milk Duds?
[57:18.650 --> 57:19.650]  What did I bring you?
[57:19.650 --> 57:21.650]  Milk chocolate suckers tonight?
[57:21.650 --> 57:22.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[57:22.650 --> 57:23.650]  To drop into the hot chocolate.
[57:23.650 --> 57:24.650]  It's going to be awesome.
[57:25.650 --> 57:26.650]  I'm in.
[57:26.650 --> 57:27.650]  All right, you guys, let's recap.
[57:27.650 --> 57:29.650]  Seems like everybody's high.
[57:29.650 --> 57:30.650]  We've been going for almost an hour.
[57:30.650 --> 57:31.650]  Let's do a quick recap.
[57:31.650 --> 57:33.650]  A year on social media.
[57:33.650 --> 57:34.650]  Damn, congratulations.
[57:34.650 --> 57:38.650]  Thanks to everybody out there that seems to like my silliness and quirkiness.
[57:38.650 --> 57:43.650]  I'll tell you, I'm always on the lookout for fun hats and stuff.
[57:43.650 --> 57:47.650]  What I have found for Christmas you all are going to love.
[57:48.650 --> 57:51.650]  So follow her on social media so that you can see it, you guys.
[57:51.650 --> 57:55.650]  Periscope and Facebook Live, because she does a lot of stuff there.
[57:55.650 --> 57:56.650]  She smokes down.
[57:56.650 --> 57:59.650]  There's a new app that I've been on, Tokwith.
[57:59.650 --> 58:03.650]  And this is kind of fun because it's just people in the cannabis community.
[58:03.650 --> 58:08.650]  And what the end goal of this app is they want to be able to have multicam users.
[58:08.650 --> 58:11.650]  So it wouldn't just be you sitting there watching me smoke.
[58:12.650 --> 58:13.650]  All of us would be interacting.
[58:13.650 --> 58:15.650]  Kind of like a tiny chat sort of thing.
[58:15.650 --> 58:16.650]  That sounds great.
[58:16.650 --> 58:17.650]  I would love to do that.
[58:17.650 --> 58:19.650]  So I'm kind of helping them promote this app.
[58:19.650 --> 58:23.650]  I think I saw Tokwith and I actually assumed that it was a pothead dating service.
[58:23.650 --> 58:26.650]  No, it's just like Periscope.
[58:26.650 --> 58:29.650]  I thought it was the green Tinder.
[58:32.650 --> 58:34.650]  It's not getting high with?
[58:34.650 --> 58:35.650]  Is it?
[58:35.650 --> 58:36.650]  Oh, no.
[58:36.650 --> 58:37.650]  Is there really one of those?
[58:37.650 --> 58:38.650]  There really is.
[58:38.650 --> 58:39.650]  Something, hold on.
[58:39.650 --> 58:41.650]  Like Grindr or Tinder?
[58:41.650 --> 58:42.650]  No, Grindr is for gay dudes.
[58:42.650 --> 58:43.650]  Oh, no, then we don't.
[58:43.650 --> 58:46.650]  Well, if you need Grindr, that's okay.
[58:46.650 --> 58:47.650]  I'm not going to discriminate.
[58:47.650 --> 58:49.650]  Pass me my phone because I got it in there.
[58:49.650 --> 58:50.650]  Fuck you, Jeff.
[58:50.650 --> 58:52.650]  Give me my phone and I'll tell you what it is, you dick.
[58:52.650 --> 58:53.650]  What are you looking for?
[58:53.650 --> 58:56.650]  The cannabis dating service?
[58:56.650 --> 58:58.650]  Yeah, I was like, I just mouthed him.
[58:58.650 --> 58:59.650]  Like, yo, hand me my phone.
[58:59.650 --> 59:02.650]  He's like, oh, Jeff's like, oh, Lindsay just wants me to hand him my phone.
[59:02.650 --> 59:03.650]  Hi there.
[59:03.650 --> 59:04.650]  Thank you.
[59:04.650 --> 59:05.650]  Hi there.
[59:05.650 --> 59:07.650]  All right, so yeah, we're going to give them a free ad.
[59:07.650 --> 59:08.650]  Hi there.
[59:08.650 --> 59:11.650]  That's basically a hookup app for potheads.
[59:11.650 --> 59:12.650]  You guys go check that one out.
[59:12.650 --> 59:14.650]  You will not find me on that shit.
[59:14.650 --> 59:18.650]  I am done as fuck with all that dating app shit.
[59:18.650 --> 59:20.650]  Trust the fuck out of me.
[59:20.650 --> 59:22.650]  Three strikes, you're out, motherfucker.
[59:22.650 --> 59:27.650]  Done did me wrong three times.
[59:27.650 --> 59:29.650]  Brought me three beds.
[59:29.650 --> 59:32.650]  Let's change the subject before I put this pen in my eye.
[59:32.650 --> 59:36.650]  In later news.
[59:37.650 --> 59:39.650]  By the way, that is a stylus as well as a pen.
[59:39.650 --> 59:41.650]  I was noticing the little tip there.
[59:41.650 --> 59:42.650]  So it would be squishy.
[59:42.650 --> 59:45.650]  Make sure you click it before you put it in there.
[59:45.650 --> 59:46.650]  You'd be really surprised.
[59:46.650 --> 59:48.650]  I'm surprised that I'm just bouncing off.
[59:48.650 --> 59:51.650]  Oh, come on.
[59:51.650 --> 59:53.650]  Safety tip for my protection.
[59:53.650 --> 59:54.650]  Suicide-free pens.
[59:54.650 --> 59:57.650]  I have to shout them guys out because they make me laugh.
[59:57.650 --> 59:59.650]  That is the Pot Brothers at Law.
[59:59.650 --> 01:00:00.650]  They're out in California.
[01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:01.650]  It's Mark and Craig.
[01:00:01.650 --> 01:00:03.650]  I think their last name is Wasserman.
[01:00:03.650 --> 01:00:05.650]  Pot Brothers at Law, fighting for the cannabis community.
[01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:06.650]  Wasserman and Wasserman.
[01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:08.650]  855-WASLAW.
[01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.650]  They have a 25-word script,
[01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.650]  which I will give you their business card to put in your wallet that there's a 25-word script.
[01:00:15.650 --> 01:00:18.650]  And it's basically the cop says, where you been?
[01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:19.650]  I don't have to discuss where I've been.
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:21.650]  I don't have to tell you where I'm going.
[01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:22.650]  I don't have to.
[01:00:22.650 --> 01:00:25.650]  And at the end, their hashtag is shut the fuck up.
[01:00:25.650 --> 01:00:28.650]  When you're done, you shut the fuck up.
[01:00:28.650 --> 01:00:33.650]  So they've sent me their hashtag hat, and I wear it, and I love it, and people know what.
[01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:35.650]  Senior hashtag STFU hat.
[01:00:35.650 --> 01:00:36.650]  I love it.
[01:00:36.650 --> 01:00:39.650]  That's shut the fuck up from my friends, the Pot Brothers at Law.
[01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:42.650]  Also, they could be WASSLAW if you want to call them.
[01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:44.650]  855-WASSLAW.
[01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:46.650]  But I think WASLAW is more appropriate.
[01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:47.650]  But check them out.
[01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:48.650]  Pot Brothers at Law, shout out.
[01:00:48.650 --> 01:00:49.650]  They do have funny social media.
[01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:50.650]  Give them a follow.
[01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:52.650]  There was somebody else that we were saying that we needed to.
[01:00:52.650 --> 01:00:53.650]  Was it August House?
[01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.650]  Was it my email?
[01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.650]  The email, yes.
[01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:56.650]  We've got to give them a shout out.
[01:00:56.650 --> 01:00:57.650]  A big shout out.
[01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:00.650]  And actually, they are going to be working with the family joint.
[01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:04.650]  He's from, I believe, Pennsylvania.
[01:01:04.650 --> 01:01:06.650]  Everything is made here in the United States.
[01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:08.650]  A really nice email.
[01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:19.650]  I'm not a big email fan, but it's got LED lights, really, really nice quartz banger that's wrapped from the bottom up, consistent, keeps your nail consistently hot.
[01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:22.650]  You told me it was programmable by your phone?
[01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:24.650]  Yes, you have to have a smartphone.
[01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:27.650]  It's called the Cube One, and there's only a few.
[01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:29.650]  You have to order them.
[01:01:29.650 --> 01:01:30.650]  Okay.
[01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:31.650]  Okay.
[01:01:31.650 --> 01:01:33.650]  And they're not cheap, this I know, but you can use my name as a promo.
[01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:34.650]  There you go.
[01:01:34.650 --> 01:01:35.650]  I just remembered that.
[01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:40.650]  But you get what you pay for, just like if you were buying Bobo Blaster's anything.
[01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:42.650]  Bobo Blaster makes great emails.
[01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:44.650]  I got one sitting over there.
[01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:45.650]  That's right.
[01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:46.650]  It needs to be a little cleaned off and used, actually.
[01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:47.650]  But you know yourself.
[01:01:47.650 --> 01:01:52.650]  If you're making American products, you're going to get what you pay for.
[01:01:52.650 --> 01:01:53.650]  Yes, exactly.
[01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:55.650]  And August House is American.
[01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:57.650]  Have you ever heard of them?
[01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:58.650]  I have not.
[01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:01.650]  Well, I was happy that you finally got it because you showed me them a while back.
[01:02:01.650 --> 01:02:02.650]  And it's pretty small.
[01:02:02.650 --> 01:02:03.650]  I should have actually brought it with me.
[01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:06.650]  It comes in a little box where you can take it along with you.
[01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:07.650]  A little black pouch.
[01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:08.650]  I saw it on Instagram.
[01:02:08.650 --> 01:02:09.650]  The nail looked really cool.
[01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:10.650]  Yeah, the coil is sweet.
[01:02:10.650 --> 01:02:12.650]  It looked pretty sweet the way it was set up.
[01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:18.650]  Like I say, I don't like e-nails, but y'all have been seeing me, and I like that I can put my clear rigs on top of that and make it look pretty.
[01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:19.650]  It's got the little cool light.
[01:02:19.650 --> 01:02:20.650]  Oh, it's got the lights on the top.
[01:02:20.650 --> 01:02:21.650]  That's fresh.
[01:02:21.650 --> 01:02:25.650]  Yeah, you set it on top of that cube, and it's got that circle just where your rig is going to sit.
[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:27.650]  It's like you're shopping at Spencer's again.
[01:02:28.650 --> 01:02:30.650]  I'm always going to be an old hippie at heart.
[01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:31.650]  Or a hot topic.
[01:02:31.650 --> 01:02:32.650]  Or a young hippie.
[01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:33.650]  Or a hot topic.
[01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:34.650]  That's a fun story.
[01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:35.650]  We shop at the same places, Granny.
[01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:36.650]  I think we do.
[01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:37.650]  Jeans and a T-shirt.
[01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:38.650]  Yep.
[01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:39.650]  Sneakers.
[01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.650]  I skate shoes for life.
[01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.650]  Somebody was like, what do you prefer for hiking shoes?
[01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.650]  And I was like, DCs, Etnies, I don't know, something similar.
[01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:47.650]  Skateboard shoes.
[01:02:47.650 --> 01:02:48.650]  As long as they fit.
[01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:50.650]  Yeah, snug them up real good.
[01:02:50.650 --> 01:02:51.650]  Yeah.
[01:02:51.650 --> 01:02:52.650]  All right.
[01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:53.650]  We've been going for an hour.
[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:54.650]  Most people want to check out by now.
[01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:55.650]  Okay, guys.
[01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:56.650]  Let's give out all of our social media stuff.
[01:02:56.650 --> 01:02:59.650]  Of course, everybody knows how to find the Davin Granny on all the social media.
[01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:01.650]  At Davin underscore Granny on Instagram.
[01:03:01.650 --> 01:03:04.650]  I think if you Google me, you're going to find me.
[01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:05.650]  Yeah, Google here, you guys.
[01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:06.650]  Watch the videos.
[01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:09.650]  Watch the stuff with all the Russian comments from other people and shit.
[01:03:09.650 --> 01:03:10.650]  See what the other people from other countries say.
[01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:13.650]  The comments are my favorite part sometimes.
[01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:15.650]  Sometimes they're disgusting.
[01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:18.650]  Well, you've got to, if you're on the internet, expect that dumb shit.
[01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:20.650]  That's what I have come to learn.
[01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:23.650]  Somebody thought Sam and I were a couple.
[01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:24.650]  THC Sam.
[01:03:24.650 --> 01:03:28.650]  They said, oh, dude, Granny sex is the best.
[01:03:28.650 --> 01:03:30.650]  Good luck as a couple.
[01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:31.650]  Yeah, that's funny.
[01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:35.650]  As soon as we logged into Facebook live, people asked if we were going to hook up when we were done.
[01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:38.650]  That's just the nature of the beast with the internet.
[01:03:38.650 --> 01:03:39.650]  People have no lives sometimes.
[01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:41.650]  Not everybody's trying to do something.
[01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:43.650]  They're out there just trying to get noticed, and that's their way to do it.
[01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:47.650]  If you're not part of anything, you'll do your best to try to create something to be a part of.
[01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:48.650]  Yes, anybody will do it.
[01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.650]  Did I just say some profound shit on accident?
[01:03:50.650 --> 01:03:52.650]  It has me going, whoa.
[01:03:52.650 --> 01:03:53.650]  Whoa.
[01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:54.650]  Deep.
[01:03:56.650 --> 01:04:00.650]  Ms. Lindsay, the traveling stoner, remind everybody how they can find you,
[01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:05.650]  because I think you promised us that by the time we recorded again, you'd have a website ready to go.
[01:04:05.650 --> 01:04:06.650]  Yes, I heard that too.
[01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:10.650]  So I have a photo shoot on the 16th of this month,
[01:04:10.650 --> 01:04:15.650]  so I will be launching the website at the end of this month, actually, for real this time.
[01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:20.650]  I have been working really hard on it, so it will be coming out at the end of the month.
[01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:25.650]  But for now, I am the traveling stoner on Instagram and Periscope.
[01:04:25.650 --> 01:04:29.650]  You can find me on Twitter as the Travel Stoner,
[01:04:29.650 --> 01:04:35.650]  and you can find me on Snapchat as Traveling Stoner Without the G.
[01:04:35.650 --> 01:04:37.650]  What's your home address?
[01:04:37.650 --> 01:04:38.650]  Yeah, no.
[01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:41.650]  Wait, hold on.
[01:04:41.650 --> 01:04:42.650]  What was that address you sent me?
[01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:43.650]  Yeah, right?
[01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:45.650]  Use maps to find where I live.
[01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:47.650]  We're in an undisclosed bunker.
[01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:48.650]  Yeah.
[01:04:49.650 --> 01:04:51.650]  We are in the—the studio needs a name.
[01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:56.650]  Yes, you do, because you know how Instagram has that little story?
[01:04:56.650 --> 01:05:00.650]  I deleted quite a few, because I actually—I didn't even want to say the name of the city,
[01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.650]  because I have learned people will try to find me.
[01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:04.650]  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:04.650 --> 01:05:06.650]  So I just said, I was being on your podcast.
[01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:07.650]  There you go.
[01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:08.650]  They don't know where you are.
[01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:14.650]  And if you guys found me through Granny's feed by any way, if you learned of this podcast through Granny,
[01:05:14.650 --> 01:05:18.650]  send me a message or tag me in something and just say, hey, I found you through the Dabbing Granny,
[01:05:18.650 --> 01:05:20.650]  so that I can give her a hug for every one of those.
[01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:21.650]  Ooh, lots of hugs.
[01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:22.650]  All my new followers.
[01:05:22.650 --> 01:05:23.650]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:24.650]  All right, so follow the Traveling Stoner.
[01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:25.650]  Thank you.
[01:05:25.650 --> 01:05:27.650]  She's going to get her shit together and get her website up.
[01:05:27.650 --> 01:05:28.650]  Yes.
[01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:29.650]  I'll take some pictures of you. I got a cool camera.
[01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:30.650]  I'm not even being creepy.
[01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:31.650]  Wherever you want to go.
[01:05:31.650 --> 01:05:32.650]  I'm not even being creepy.
[01:05:32.650 --> 01:05:33.650]  I have a good camera.
[01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:35.650]  I wasn't even going to take that way.
[01:05:35.650 --> 01:05:37.650]  I just didn't give you the chance.
[01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:42.650]  Pretty sure I want the sun coming from that way, and I need you over there, and we'll fucking take pictures.
[01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:43.650]  Perfect.
[01:05:43.650 --> 01:05:45.650]  I usually just take pictures of weed, to tell you the truth.
[01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:46.650]  It's a lot easier.
[01:05:46.650 --> 01:05:49.650]  I'm going to be on a billboard on Colfax Avenue.
[01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:51.650]  A real picture of me.
[01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:52.650]  What?
[01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:53.650]  You should elaborate.
[01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:54.650]  Yes, you didn't know this?
[01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:55.650]  No.
[01:05:55.650 --> 01:05:56.650]  Yes.
[01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:57.650]  Not in some.
[01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:58.650]  You know that one hat pin?
[01:05:58.650 --> 01:05:59.650]  Yeah.
[01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:00.650]  The tall one where I'm holding that teapot?
[01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:01.650]  Yeah.
[01:06:01.650 --> 01:06:07.650]  THC, Sam, and I had a photo shoot, and they're putting me on a billboard on Colfax Avenue.
[01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:08.650]  Yes.
[01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:10.650]  Just say it's a photo shoot.
[01:06:10.650 --> 01:06:12.650]  For THC Magazine?
[01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:13.650]  Is that what you're advertising?
[01:06:13.650 --> 01:06:14.650]  No, this is for Ooze 420.
[01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:15.650]  Ooze 420?
[01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:16.650]  What kind of product is that?
[01:06:16.650 --> 01:06:19.650]  It's this little teapot thing that goes on a pin.
[01:06:19.650 --> 01:06:21.650]  It's like a bubbler attachment that looks like a teapot.
[01:06:21.650 --> 01:06:23.650]  I love smoking out of it.
[01:06:23.650 --> 01:06:24.650]  Okay.
[01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:26.650]  Do an Instagram video with it so that we can see it.
[01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.650]  No, we're going to go one better.
[01:06:27.650 --> 01:06:30.650]  When that billboard's up, we're going to do a group dab up under the billboard.
[01:06:30.650 --> 01:06:31.650]  I'm in.
[01:06:31.650 --> 01:06:34.650]  I'll take a gram dab hanging from the billboard.
[01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:35.650]  Doesn't that sound like fun?
[01:06:35.650 --> 01:06:36.650]  Hanging.
[01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:37.650]  I don't know how, but.
[01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:38.650]  What are you, Brett?
[01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:39.650]  No, I'm Spider-Man.
[01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:40.650]  Made me think of a-
[01:06:40.650 --> 01:06:41.650]  The Jews or Spiderman?
[01:06:41.650 --> 01:06:42.650]  The 70s show.
[01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:43.650]  They used to climb up the water tower.
[01:06:43.650 --> 01:06:46.650]  I've climbed up a few water towers in my life.
[01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:50.650]  Shout out to Brett, by the way.
[01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:51.650]  Yes.
[01:06:51.650 --> 01:06:52.650]  Hey, Brett.
[01:06:52.650 --> 01:06:55.650]  Just for being awesome and for always being so positive.
[01:06:55.650 --> 01:06:56.650]  Loving his videos.
[01:06:56.650 --> 01:07:02.650]  Yes, and he's been sick lately, so I hope you're getting over it there and you're feeling better by the time this comes out.
[01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:06.650]  I want to get with him and do this cold terping thing that I've been hearing about.
[01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:10.650]  If you've got some terps, I've got this device here that you've got to do.
[01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:13.650]  We'll guide you through that as soon as-
[01:07:13.650 --> 01:07:15.650]  Look at the Colorado-
[01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:17.650]  It's got a little Colorado flag, Milly on there.
[01:07:17.650 --> 01:07:19.650]  That's my first-
[01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:20.650]  Chris made that for us.
[01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:21.650]  Chris made that.
[01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:22.650]  Yeah, it's all me.
[01:07:22.650 --> 01:07:23.650]  This is your Milly?
[01:07:23.650 --> 01:07:24.650]  Yeah, I made that whole thing.
[01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:25.650]  That's all me.
[01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:26.650]  I'm very impressed.
[01:07:26.650 --> 01:07:28.650]  It's my first functional.
[01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:34.650]  Since we're giving shout outs and stuff, I want to give a huge shout out and a heads up to our buddy, THC Sam.
[01:07:34.650 --> 01:07:36.650]  Sam wanted to come tonight.
[01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:37.650]  His life's been overwhelming.
[01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:40.650]  He got to interview Tommy Chong, so he didn't have time to make it here today.
[01:07:40.650 --> 01:07:41.650]  I get it.
[01:07:41.650 --> 01:07:43.650]  I'm sorry, Tommy Chong, us?
[01:07:43.650 --> 01:07:44.650]  Yeah, go.
[01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:46.650]  He's a photographer.
[01:07:46.650 --> 01:07:47.650]  He works for a magazine.
[01:07:47.650 --> 01:07:51.650]  When somebody like Tommy Chong comes through town, your job is to go take pictures and do magazine shit.
[01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:55.650]  Yes, it's a cannabis-based magazine, so I guess-
[01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.650]  That's your job.
[01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:58.650]  Go do that.
[01:07:58.650 --> 01:07:59.650]  Sam, you've got an open invitation.
[01:07:59.650 --> 01:08:02.650]  There are three chairs here at the table that are available.
[01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:04.650]  One of them has got your name on it whenever you want to come.
[01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:11.650]  Also, Brett, I want to get you to come be on the show here at my house where we've got this good studio, the good mics where the equipment doesn't screw up.
[01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:12.650]  We can be comfortable.
[01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:13.650]  It's quiet.
[01:08:13.650 --> 01:08:14.650]  Nobody interrupts other than you.
[01:08:14.650 --> 01:08:16.650]  We can get you organized.
[01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:17.650]  And Kabuki Fox.
[01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:20.650]  I've had some real good conversations with him about CBDs.
[01:08:20.650 --> 01:08:22.650]  Kabuki's been on a couple times.
[01:08:22.650 --> 01:08:23.650]  He's due for another episode.
[01:08:23.650 --> 01:08:25.650]  We need to get him here again.
[01:08:25.650 --> 01:08:31.650]  I'd love to have Kabuki across the table, talk about certain doses of specific cannabinoids for certain conditions.
[01:08:32.650 --> 01:08:37.650]  So between the CBDs and Brett with the Terps, we are talking new age medicine.
[01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:38.650]  Yes, yes.
[01:08:38.650 --> 01:08:39.650]  And Sam.
[01:08:39.650 --> 01:08:45.650]  Sam and I, I love to talk about traumatic brain injuries with Sam because, of course, everybody knows that I've got a TBI that fucks me up.
[01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:47.650]  You hear it on the podcast occasionally.
[01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:50.650]  I just stop and start a brand new sentence because I don't know what the fuck I'm even saying anymore.
[01:08:50.650 --> 01:08:52.650]  That's from getting hit in the head really, really hard, you guys.
[01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:53.650]  That's what that is from.
[01:08:53.650 --> 01:08:55.650]  I apologize when that shit happens.
[01:08:55.650 --> 01:08:59.650]  I also want to say that Sam is actually running this food drive with us as well.
[01:08:59.650 --> 01:09:03.650]  We forgot to even like, that's why Sam was supposed to be here tonight.
[01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:04.650]  Exactly.
[01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:05.650]  Uh, duh.
[01:09:05.650 --> 01:09:06.650]  Maybe one day.
[01:09:06.650 --> 01:09:07.650]  I know, right?
[01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:08.650]  Sorry about that, Sam.
[01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:11.650]  I'm sorry I did a suppository before we came here.
[01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:15.650]  But yes, Sam is also another big part of helping us getting this food drive together.
[01:09:15.650 --> 01:09:20.650]  As is the people over at the glass grind.
[01:09:20.650 --> 01:09:22.650]  I spaced out on her Instagram name.
[01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:23.650]  I know it's blown.
[01:09:23.650 --> 01:09:24.650]  Cloudy Cody.
[01:09:24.650 --> 01:09:26.650]  She's going to help us with the flyers.
[01:09:26.650 --> 01:09:27.650]  Yes.
[01:09:28.650 --> 01:09:31.650]  I'm glad we caught up on that and didn't skip people.
[01:09:31.650 --> 01:09:32.650]  Yes.
[01:09:32.650 --> 01:09:33.650]  That's all right.
[01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:34.650]  We're all high here.
[01:09:34.650 --> 01:09:35.650]  It's good.
[01:09:35.650 --> 01:09:36.650]  It's a cannabis podcast.
[01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:37.650]  People understand.
[01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:38.650]  Oh, bro, I forgot.
[01:09:38.650 --> 01:09:41.650]  Well, at least we told them what the, you know, food drive was about.
[01:09:41.650 --> 01:09:44.650]  And we said we're still kind of, it's not concrete yet.
[01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:47.650]  We have until Friday to get them day boxes out.
[01:09:47.650 --> 01:09:48.650]  Yeah.
[01:09:48.650 --> 01:09:49.650]  Yeah.
[01:09:49.650 --> 01:09:51.650]  And you know, we still have three spots open for people.
[01:09:51.650 --> 01:09:52.650]  So.
[01:09:52.650 --> 01:09:54.650]  Bobo, I did not forget you, bro.
[01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:55.650]  I pay attention.
[01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.650]  I made a mental note.
[01:09:56.650 --> 01:09:57.650]  I still got to be like, Bobo do plugs.
[01:09:57.650 --> 01:09:58.650]  Yeah.
[01:09:58.650 --> 01:10:00.650]  Still doing the burnisher things that's still available on big cartel.com.
[01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:01.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:01.650 --> 01:10:02.650]  Still there.
[01:10:02.650 --> 01:10:03.650]  That's still there.
[01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:04.650]  Still active.
[01:10:04.650 --> 01:10:05.650]  I'm still doing that.
[01:10:05.650 --> 01:10:06.650]  I'll get too many words.
[01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:08.650]  I'm not super, super busy, but I'm still doing them.
[01:10:08.650 --> 01:10:09.650]  They're still available.
[01:10:09.650 --> 01:10:11.650]  I still do custom stuff with that as well.
[01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.650]  Focus in pretty heavily on the new glass game.
[01:10:13.650 --> 01:10:14.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:14.650 --> 01:10:15.650]  That's my.
[01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:17.650]  So follow the new, the new glass page, right?
[01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:18.650]  Yes.
[01:10:18.650 --> 01:10:19.650]  Follow new glass page.
[01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:21.650]  I have no, no me glass.

[01:10:31.650 --> 01:10:33.650]  And it's the same thing on Periscope.
[01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.650]  And I think that's all I'm on.
[01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:37.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:38.650]  That's about it.
[01:10:38.650 --> 01:10:40.650]  You're not one of those people that's on every single.
[01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.650]  I'm barely on those.
[01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:43.650]  I tried to.
[01:10:43.650 --> 01:10:44.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:44.650 --> 01:10:45.650]  I tried to get through spurs.
[01:10:45.650 --> 01:10:47.650]  But you were like logging off right as I got in there.
[01:10:47.650 --> 01:10:48.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:48.650 --> 01:10:50.650]  I go through spurs where I'm like, Jeff is here, Bobo's gone.
[01:10:50.650 --> 01:10:51.650]  I was so happy to see him today.
[01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:53.650]  And I just thought of somebody else.
[01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:54.650]  We need to shout out.
[01:10:54.650 --> 01:10:55.650]  Color me filthy.
[01:10:55.650 --> 01:10:56.650]  Yeah.
[01:10:56.650 --> 01:10:57.650]  Oh, yeah.
[01:10:57.650 --> 01:10:58.650]  This is a new artist.
[01:10:58.650 --> 01:11:01.650]  I've just become friends with on Instagram and he's.
[01:11:01.650 --> 01:11:02.650]  Yeah.
[01:11:02.650 --> 01:11:04.650]  And he's embracing my friends.
[01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:06.650]  He's and his name is Paul color me filthy.
[01:11:06.650 --> 01:11:08.650]  And we're part of his little family.
[01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:09.650]  Yeah.
[01:11:09.650 --> 01:11:10.650]  That's pretty cool.
[01:11:10.650 --> 01:11:11.650]  I like the zombie photos.
[01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:12.650]  I've been seeing of everybody.
[01:11:12.650 --> 01:11:14.650]  Turning you guys all green, killing everybody.
[01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:16.650]  He's make stickers out all those.
[01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:17.650]  I think they're pretty cool.
[01:11:17.650 --> 01:11:19.650]  What he's been doing to my friends.
[01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:20.650]  I think I'm addicted to bit mojis.
[01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:22.650]  You are so obsessed.
[01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:24.650]  The funnest shit ever.
[01:11:24.650 --> 01:11:25.650]  It is so funny.
[01:11:25.650 --> 01:11:27.650]  A little rasta Jeff everywhere.
[01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:28.650]  Doing different funny shit.
[01:11:28.650 --> 01:11:29.650]  So rad.
[01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:30.650]  It's so.
[01:11:30.650 --> 01:11:31.650]  I'm obsessed.
[01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:32.650]  You're correct.
[01:11:32.650 --> 01:11:33.650]  I know.
[01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:34.650]  All right, you guys.
[01:11:34.650 --> 01:11:35.650]  You can find me on.
[01:11:35.650 --> 01:11:37.650]  I'm on all of the damn social medias on Twitter.
[01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:40.650]  It's at GFYH podcast is probably the best way to find me on Instagram.
[01:11:40.650 --> 01:11:42.650]  It would be really rad if you follow me on Instagram.
[01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:44.650]  It's at Irie underscore genetics.
[01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:45.650]  Hopefully we'll get to see you guys.
[01:11:45.650 --> 01:11:46.650]  I'm on all of the social media.
[01:11:46.650 --> 01:11:47.650]  I'm on Instagram.
[01:11:47.650 --> 01:11:49.650]  It's at Irie underscore genetics.
[01:11:49.650 --> 01:11:53.650]  Hopefully by the time this episode comes out, I'll be at 10,000 followers.
[01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:55.650]  You can find me on Facebook.
[01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:56.650]  The girl from your heart podcast.
[01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:59.650]  I think that's enough of that social media stuff.
[01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:01.650]  I don't need to pitch too many more of them.
[01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.650]  I think that's all we're going to do for today.
[01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:05.650]  I want to thank everybody for coming, especially granny.
[01:12:05.650 --> 01:12:07.650]  You've got an hour drive home, so we're going to.
[01:12:07.650 --> 01:12:08.650]  I bet it was worth it.
[01:12:08.650 --> 01:12:11.650]  We're going to let you sober up so you're not medicated for the drive.
[01:12:11.650 --> 01:12:12.650]  Of course not.
[01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:13.650]  Wink, wink, wink.
[01:12:13.650 --> 01:12:14.650]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:15.650]  Right.
[01:12:15.650 --> 01:12:17.650]  I think the rest of us are going to get high as shit because we don't have too
[01:12:17.650 --> 01:12:18.650]  far to go.
[01:12:18.650 --> 01:12:20.650]  You're going to just sit here and watch granny.
[01:12:20.650 --> 01:12:21.650]  Yes, yes.
[01:12:21.650 --> 01:12:22.650]  You have to be safe and sober for your drive home.
[01:12:22.650 --> 01:12:23.650]  All of us.
[01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:27.650]  I'm here at my table, so I'm going to take a gram dab.
[01:12:27.650 --> 01:12:30.650]  I'll just have to have some green crack before I go, so I'm wide awake.
[01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:31.650]  There you go.
[01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:35.650]  We may do a little Facebook live video or something here since we've got a
[01:12:35.650 --> 01:12:37.650]  whole bunch of cool ass people in the building.
[01:12:37.650 --> 01:12:38.650]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:39.650]  All right.
[01:12:39.650 --> 01:12:40.650]  So we're going to wrap up the podcast.
[01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:41.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you guys for listening.
[01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:43.650]  Of course, I'm going to say that thing where if you want to go to iTunes and
[01:12:43.650 --> 01:12:45.650]  leave us a review, that would be super duper cool.
[01:12:45.650 --> 01:12:47.650]  I will read your review on a future episode.
[01:12:47.650 --> 01:12:50.650]  If you've got anything that you would like to say and you do not want to do it
[01:12:50.650 --> 01:12:52.650]  in a public forum on social media, send me an email.
[01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:54.650]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:55.650]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:58.650]  If you want some grow lessons, if you need some advice, if you just want to say
[01:12:58.650 --> 01:13:00.650]  what's up, if you want to tell me to go fuck myself, I'm down.
[01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:01.650]  Send it.
[01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:02.650]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:03.650]  Good or bad, I ain't scared.
[01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:04.650]  I want to know what people are thinking.
[01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.650]  I'm into it.
[01:13:05.650 --> 01:13:06.650]  Be honest with me.
[01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:07.650]  I'm a blunt person.
[01:13:07.650 --> 01:13:08.650]  I like honesty.
[01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:09.650]  So that's all I've got for you this week.
[01:13:09.650 --> 01:13:11.650]  Big shout out to the dabbing granny.
[01:13:11.650 --> 01:13:14.650]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.020]  Flowing in fear,
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:31.020]  the days and weeks that you're not here.
[01:14:34.020 --> 01:14:36.020]  It was all the waiting in vain.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:42.020]  The day that you arrive.
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:45.020]  My sleeping monkey is revived.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:50.020]  Did you send him home on the train?
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:58.420]  On the train home, home, on the train
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:04.820]  I just sent my monkey on the train
[01:15:04.820 --> 01:15:09.820]  The day that you arrived
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:13.820]  My sleeping monkey is revived
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:19.820]  But you sent him home on the train
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:32.830]  Why'd you send my monkey on the train?
[01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:40.830]  The day that you arrived, my sleeping monkey is revived
[01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:46.830]  But you sent him home on the train
[01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:55.720]  On the train
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:16:00.720]  Why'd you send my monkey on the train?
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:08.590]  My sleeping monkey is revived
[01:16:08.590 --> 01:16:13.590]  But you sent him home on the train
[01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:27.800]  Why'd you send my monkey on the train?
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:36.030]  The day that you arrived, my sleeping monkey is revived
[01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:42.030]  But you sent him home on the train
[01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:50.030]  Home on the train
[01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:57.030]  Why'd you send my monkey on the train?
[01:16:57.030 --> 01:17:03.030]  The day that you arrived, my sleeping monkey is revived
[01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:09.030]  But you sent him home on the train
[01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:30.990]  Home on the train now
