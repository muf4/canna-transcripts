[00:01.790 --> 00:19.730]  Welcome to the show podcast world.
[00:19.730 --> 00:26.770]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode 685 of the Grow From Your
[00:26.770 --> 00:27.770]  Heart podcast.
[00:27.770 --> 00:32.610]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about starting your own seed business.
[00:32.610 --> 00:36.170]  Before we get to that part of the podcast, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the
[00:36.170 --> 00:40.430]  great folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:40.430 --> 00:44.470]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to the hardest
[00:44.470 --> 00:47.410]  working man in cannabis, my friend James Brown.
[00:47.410 --> 00:49.690]  Let's send a big fist bump to Danny Potts.
[00:49.690 --> 00:52.330]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Alabama man.
[00:52.330 --> 00:56.130]  I want to send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy Maverick.
[00:56.130 --> 00:59.690]  Let's send a thank you shout out to a new supporter, our friend Terp Yuper.
[00:59.690 --> 01:02.490]  Let's send a thank you shout out to the Larf Night Rises.
[01:02.490 --> 01:06.410]  Let's send a big fist bump to a fellow podcaster Caribou Heart TV.
[01:06.410 --> 01:10.250]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:10.250 --> 01:13.130]  to my friend Crazy Hand Grows.
[01:13.130 --> 01:18.010]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:18.010 --> 01:21.690]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:21.690 --> 01:27.890]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:27.890 --> 01:31.370]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen and you know there is a link
[01:31.370 --> 01:37.050]  in the show notes and the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[01:37.050 --> 01:40.090]  All right, I don't want to waste too much time.
[01:40.090 --> 01:41.570]  Let's jump right into this email.
[01:41.570 --> 01:44.950]  I got a great email from a person on Patreon.
[01:44.950 --> 01:46.330]  Let's see if they want their name said.
[01:46.330 --> 01:48.090]  Yes, they do want to be called Danny Potts.
[01:48.090 --> 01:49.870]  So big shout out to Danny Potts.
[01:49.870 --> 01:51.050]  Let's jump right into their message.
[01:51.050 --> 01:52.050]  It goes like this.
[01:52.050 --> 01:55.010]  It says Rasta Jeff you bad motherfucker.
[01:55.010 --> 01:56.490]  I like it when it starts like that.
[01:56.490 --> 01:57.890]  It says I love the show.
[01:57.890 --> 02:01.570]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast and the Dude Grow show keep me learning and entertained
[02:01.570 --> 02:05.170]  on my two hour drive to and from work.
[02:05.170 --> 02:06.170]  That is a long drive.
[02:06.170 --> 02:08.810]  You drive in two hours each direction.
[02:08.810 --> 02:09.810]  Big respect.
[02:09.810 --> 02:10.810]  That's some dedication.
[02:10.810 --> 02:12.130]  That's a lot of hours in the car.
[02:12.130 --> 02:13.130]  It does go on.
[02:13.130 --> 02:15.570]  It says I'm a new grower on my second season.
[02:15.570 --> 02:18.450]  I just ordered my first batch of IRIE genetics.
[02:18.450 --> 02:19.450]  Congratulations brother.
[02:19.450 --> 02:20.450]  Welcome to the club.
[02:20.450 --> 02:24.330]  If you have any questions about those genetics when you're growing them, I do expect more
[02:24.330 --> 02:25.330]  emails.
[02:25.330 --> 02:27.110]  I will answer all of those questions.
[02:27.110 --> 02:31.710]  It does say I wanted to get some IRIE to search for a mother plant and a father plant
[02:31.710 --> 02:32.710]  to breed with.
[02:32.710 --> 02:34.950]  However, IRIE was unavailable.
[02:34.950 --> 02:36.470]  So I picked up Morning Dew.
[02:36.470 --> 02:38.870]  That is a great cross to pick up.
[02:38.870 --> 02:40.830]  Unfortunately, the IRIE sells well.
[02:40.830 --> 02:45.170]  I guess fortunately for me, unfortunately for you, the IRIE sells out quite quickly.
[02:45.170 --> 02:46.590]  That strain has been very well advertised.
[02:46.590 --> 02:48.870]  It has gotten very popular.
[02:48.870 --> 02:50.670]  That one is all over the internet.
[02:50.670 --> 02:52.270]  So it does sell out quite quickly.
[02:52.270 --> 02:53.910]  I cannot make enough of that.
[02:53.910 --> 02:55.150]  I've made F2s.
[02:55.150 --> 02:59.510]  I'm working on the F3s, which I will release eventually, but I cannot keep the IRIE in
[02:59.510 --> 03:00.510]  stock.
[03:00.510 --> 03:02.350]  So I'm glad you understand that.
[03:02.350 --> 03:03.710]  I'm glad you went with the Morning Dew.
[03:03.710 --> 03:06.150]  That is a great backup plan, a good decision.
[03:06.150 --> 03:10.710]  It goes on to say I'll be doing a pheno hunt and the winner will be breeding with Jinx
[03:10.710 --> 03:12.750]  Proof's 9 pound hammer.
[03:12.750 --> 03:14.750]  That's going to be an amazing cross.
[03:14.750 --> 03:18.830]  I'm already running strain name ideas through my head.
[03:18.830 --> 03:21.910]  The first thing that happened was like Morning Dew 9 pound hammer.
[03:21.910 --> 03:23.270]  Let's start naming this shit.
[03:23.270 --> 03:25.590]  For some reason, that's the first thing my brain wants to go to.
[03:25.590 --> 03:27.550]  It's going to be an amazing cross.
[03:27.550 --> 03:30.990]  Jinx Proof is a great breeder, great dude.
[03:30.990 --> 03:33.630]  Definitely I have some, I stand behind my Morning Dew.
[03:33.630 --> 03:34.990]  So that's going to be an amazing cross.
[03:34.990 --> 03:36.550]  I hope that goes well for you.
[03:36.550 --> 03:39.830]  I cannot wait to get a few of those seeds to grow out and see what you did.
[03:39.830 --> 03:40.830]  Wink wink.
[03:40.830 --> 03:42.070]  Anyway, let's keep going with the message.
[03:42.070 --> 03:47.350]  It says, thank you for everything you do and for the knowledge you drop on us, bro.
[03:47.350 --> 03:48.350]  Thank you.
[03:48.350 --> 03:49.350]  You are very welcome.
[03:49.350 --> 03:52.590]  I feel like I would explode if I didn't share this knowledge.
[03:52.910 --> 03:58.230]  I feel like I was given this gift of gab and the ability to just retain and regurgitate
[03:58.230 --> 03:59.230]  information.
[03:59.230 --> 04:01.510]  I feel like this is my duty and my job.
[04:01.510 --> 04:02.510]  This is like my service.
[04:02.510 --> 04:03.630]  It's what I was put here to do.
[04:03.630 --> 04:05.550]  If I didn't do it, something would go wrong.
[04:05.550 --> 04:09.790]  Like cosmically, karmically, I may just spontaneously combust or something.
[04:09.790 --> 04:11.230]  So this is what I'm supposed to be doing.
[04:11.230 --> 04:12.230]  So thank you, bro.
[04:12.230 --> 04:13.590]  I appreciate that.
[04:13.590 --> 04:18.590]  It says, my goal is to practice breeding to develop a medicine that works for my wife's
[04:18.630 --> 04:25.550]  chronic pain and nausea, which is a result from an infection of a flesh eating bacteria.
[04:25.550 --> 04:29.630]  He did put the damn Greek words for the flesh eating bacteria here, but I'm not even going
[04:29.630 --> 04:31.350]  to try to stumble through those words.
[04:31.350 --> 04:36.430]  It goes on to say, oh, also a big respect for stepping up to try to create medicine
[04:36.430 --> 04:37.430]  for your wife.
[04:37.430 --> 04:38.670]  That is true love right there.
[04:38.670 --> 04:42.990]  Creating medicine for one person that you love dearly to treat them because you're watching
[04:42.990 --> 04:43.990]  them suffer.
[04:43.990 --> 04:46.230]  You want the quality of both of your lives to be better.
[04:46.230 --> 04:49.830]  Big respect for taking initiative and for having that passion.
[04:49.830 --> 04:52.190]  That is often what inspires a breeder.
[04:52.190 --> 04:57.310]  Something like this is what inspires a cannabis grower, a breeder, an advocate, an activist.
[04:57.310 --> 04:58.870]  This is what gets people on our team.
[04:58.870 --> 05:00.070]  So thank you.
[05:00.070 --> 05:01.070]  Big respect.
[05:01.070 --> 05:03.270]  It says, and I hope your wife is okay also.
[05:03.270 --> 05:05.470]  And if I can do anything, let me know.
[05:05.470 --> 05:10.890]  It says 13 surgeries later, she lives a somewhat normal life, but the pain and nausea keep
[05:10.890 --> 05:13.990]  her relying on opiates and other scary pharmaceuticals.
[05:14.950 --> 05:16.350]  That is 13 surgeries.
[05:16.350 --> 05:17.830]  I couldn't imagine that.
[05:17.830 --> 05:20.230]  Surgeries make me just small stuff.
[05:20.230 --> 05:23.590]  Like I had a tooth pulled and I had a fucking panic attack all day for that.
[05:23.590 --> 05:26.630]  So surgeries and things are not up my alley.
[05:26.630 --> 05:27.830]  Your wife is a soldier, bro.
[05:27.830 --> 05:28.830]  Big respect to her.
[05:28.830 --> 05:32.290]  She is definitely in the iry army and something weird.
[05:32.290 --> 05:34.030]  If I take pills, I get nauseous.
[05:34.030 --> 05:38.230]  I don't like like even ibuprofen or Vicodin or something like that.
[05:38.230 --> 05:39.230]  I can't take pills.
[05:39.230 --> 05:40.470]  They make me want to throw up.
[05:40.470 --> 05:45.710]  So it's amazing how our bodies are so different that your wife is using these things to combat
[05:45.710 --> 05:49.630]  the nausea and those things make me throw up immediately.
[05:49.630 --> 05:51.750]  It's amazing how our bodies work.
[05:51.750 --> 05:52.750]  There is a point to this.
[05:52.750 --> 05:56.870]  It says, I would like to find a strain that helps reduce the amount of pharmaceuticals
[05:56.870 --> 05:58.230]  needed daily.
[05:58.230 --> 05:59.230]  Yes.
[05:59.230 --> 06:00.390]  That's such a beautiful thing.
[06:00.390 --> 06:05.970]  I had the honor and the privilege of being a major part in the first dispensary here
[06:05.970 --> 06:07.190]  in Pueblo, Colorado.
[06:07.190 --> 06:09.030]  I was one of the first.
[06:09.030 --> 06:11.870]  I was like the first bud tender to have a reputation.
[06:11.870 --> 06:17.190]  I'm just saying I was one of the first bud tenders to develop a bud tender client, bud
[06:17.190 --> 06:20.910]  tender patient relationship with my clientele here in this area.
[06:20.910 --> 06:23.630]  I was very blessed to be in an area that we had medical marijuana.
[06:23.630 --> 06:25.230]  We established a dispensary.
[06:25.230 --> 06:27.030]  I got to meet sick people.
[06:27.030 --> 06:30.030]  I got to see what it was like when somebody would come in.
[06:30.030 --> 06:32.910]  Some of my favorites are the little old ladies that were brand new to cannabis.
[06:32.910 --> 06:34.630]  The younger kids, they're experimenting.
[06:34.630 --> 06:36.670]  They're going to smoke weed and see what they like.
[06:36.670 --> 06:38.790]  They're hip and they talk fast and learn quick.
[06:38.790 --> 06:43.130]  The little old ladies that would come in and they're like, since I tried smoking, sometimes
[06:43.130 --> 06:45.190]  I enjoy this and it's helping with some of this.
[06:45.190 --> 06:47.710]  I would ask them, what are you smoking for?
[06:47.710 --> 06:48.710]  What is your ailment?
[06:48.710 --> 06:49.710]  Is it your back?
[06:49.710 --> 06:50.710]  Is it your neck?
[06:50.710 --> 06:51.710]  Is it your back and your neck?
[06:51.710 --> 06:52.710]  Is it your knees?
[06:52.710 --> 06:53.710]  Is it your stomach?
[06:53.710 --> 06:55.350]  I would give them samples of products to take home.
[06:55.350 --> 06:58.550]  Smoke those products and come back and tell me the results they had with smoking that
[06:58.550 --> 06:59.550]  product.
[06:59.550 --> 07:02.350]  They'd be like, when I smoked the chocolate chunk, I slept really good.
[07:02.350 --> 07:06.510]  The Maui Wowie made my head spin too much and the sour diesel is too damn stinky.
[07:06.510 --> 07:08.470]  Those are the kind of reports we'd get from them.
[07:08.470 --> 07:12.470]  But developing that relationship and learning what would help these people, it was the most
[07:12.470 --> 07:14.830]  rewarding experience.
[07:14.830 --> 07:20.430]  That drove me deeper and deeper into growing, into wanting to dial in my medicine and defining
[07:20.430 --> 07:22.270]  specific strains for people.
[07:22.270 --> 07:25.590]  One of the things I really noticed was happening when I was working with these older people
[07:25.590 --> 07:28.830]  is that they would tell me they were able to eliminate some of the medicines they were
[07:28.830 --> 07:29.830]  taking.
[07:29.830 --> 07:34.030]  If they were taking three medicines for pain and two to help them sleep, the right cannabis
[07:34.030 --> 07:36.790]  would solve all five of those pills problems.
[07:36.790 --> 07:40.070]  Then they don't have to take the pill that's making them constipated because of these three
[07:40.070 --> 07:41.070]  pills.
[07:41.070 --> 07:43.870]  Then they don't have to take the pill that's messing up their vision because of this one
[07:43.870 --> 07:44.870]  pill.
[07:44.870 --> 07:47.030]  Then they don't have to take their liver pill because all these other things are fucking
[07:47.030 --> 07:48.830]  up their liver and their kidneys.
[07:48.830 --> 07:50.950]  They would just stop taking so many pharmaceuticals.
[07:50.950 --> 07:56.310]  It was amazing to see cannabis able to fill that role, just fix their bodies in such a
[07:56.310 --> 07:57.310]  magical way.
[07:57.430 --> 08:02.470]  Anyway, I'm rambling, but yes, it is a beautiful goal to try to minimize the amount of pharmaceuticals
[08:02.470 --> 08:04.390]  that anybody is putting in their body.
[08:04.390 --> 08:05.390]  Great goal, great passion.
[08:05.390 --> 08:07.350]  Let me stay on focus here.
[08:07.350 --> 08:09.670]  I am quite stoned and quite rambly.
[08:09.670 --> 08:13.910]  Big shout out to the friends that allegedly possibly traded me seeds for concentrates.
[08:13.910 --> 08:14.910]  Good job, bro.
[08:14.910 --> 08:18.350]  I know you don't want to talk about it on the show, but you just got a shout out on
[08:18.350 --> 08:19.350]  the down low.
[08:19.350 --> 08:20.350]  It goes on in this message.
[08:20.350 --> 08:25.110]  It says, I also enjoy growing and breeding so much that I would like to pursue the idea
[08:25.110 --> 08:27.270]  of opening my own seed company.
[08:27.430 --> 08:28.430]  I think that is quite the endeavor.
[08:28.430 --> 08:29.790]  That will be quite the task.
[08:29.790 --> 08:32.750]  I hope you are in it, but we'll talk about that more in just a moment.
[08:32.750 --> 08:36.950]  It says, keeping good genetics around and helping others that need this medicine is
[08:36.950 --> 08:42.390]  where my head is, except I have no idea how to continue breeding wise.
[08:42.390 --> 08:46.550]  Then it says, I'm learning and I will get better and the business side and marketing
[08:46.550 --> 08:47.710]  scare me.
[08:47.710 --> 08:51.390]  How might one go about setting up a seed company legally in a medical state?
[08:51.390 --> 08:54.390]  All right, here's where the main part of the question comes in.
[08:54.390 --> 09:00.830]  How might one go about setting up a seed company in a legal state that may have recreational
[09:00.830 --> 09:02.430]  past in the near future?
[09:02.430 --> 09:04.150]  Sorry for the long message.
[09:04.150 --> 09:06.750]  Keep up the great work from Danny Potts.
[09:06.750 --> 09:13.110]  Our friend wants to start a seed company in a medical state that possibly will go recreational
[09:13.110 --> 09:15.490]  in the very near future.
[09:15.490 --> 09:19.830]  Our friend straight up said that they are intimidated or afraid of the marketing and
[09:19.830 --> 09:20.830]  business side.
[09:20.830 --> 09:22.230]  That is not their forte.
[09:22.350 --> 09:26.710]  Honestly, that was not my specialty either when I started a seed company.
[09:26.710 --> 09:28.110]  That is something I had to learn.
[09:28.110 --> 09:32.030]  My advice, if you're really going to do it, maybe take a small business school, maybe
[09:32.030 --> 09:34.090]  get some business advisors.
[09:34.090 --> 09:39.110]  Do that stuff early because I made so many mistakes as a small business, as a person
[09:39.110 --> 09:45.390]  starting a business, but I did not know I was starting a seed company when I started
[09:45.390 --> 09:46.390]  this.
[09:46.390 --> 09:49.710]  I know you asked how this started and for some advice.
[09:49.710 --> 09:53.990]  The best way I could do that is start off by telling you how I fell into this.
[09:53.990 --> 09:57.830]  Let me just segue into how I fell into owning a seed company.
[09:57.830 --> 10:01.470]  Then we'll talk about developing your seed company and some of the things that came with
[10:01.470 --> 10:02.470]  me starting mine.
[10:02.470 --> 10:04.510]  That's just the best way to make this episode happen.
[10:04.510 --> 10:06.110]  So one, two, three, here we go.
[10:06.110 --> 10:11.310]  I started making seeds because I was dissatisfied with what I was purchasing online.
[10:11.310 --> 10:13.630]  I was paying a lot of money for seeds.
[10:13.630 --> 10:17.990]  They would come and half of them would be crushed because the packaging was terrible.
[10:18.230 --> 10:19.870]  Sometimes customs would fucking take my seeds.
[10:19.870 --> 10:23.110]  They wouldn't even make it to my door.
[10:23.110 --> 10:26.190]  A lot of times I would grow them and they would be intersex or they wouldn't even be
[10:26.190 --> 10:27.190]  what they were labeled.
[10:27.190 --> 10:30.230]  I would order these seeds that said they were going to smell like gasoline and be covered
[10:30.230 --> 10:33.910]  in trichomes and they would smell like fucking roses and have no trichomes.
[10:33.910 --> 10:36.390]  I was like, that's not really cool of you.
[10:36.390 --> 10:37.390]  So I started breeding.
[10:37.390 --> 10:41.590]  I found a few things that I did like, things that did kind of have some quality to it.
[10:41.590 --> 10:44.070]  Then I wanted to make more seeds and see what I could do.
[10:44.070 --> 10:45.790]  I started breeding for myself.
[10:45.790 --> 10:46.790]  I made seeds.
[10:46.790 --> 10:47.790]  I found seeds that I liked.
[10:48.590 --> 10:49.590]  I found plants that I liked.
[10:49.590 --> 10:50.590]  I bred them together.
[10:50.590 --> 10:51.590]  I just kept playing around.
[10:51.590 --> 10:53.630]  I was just kind of making seeds for myself.
[10:53.630 --> 10:56.350]  Then I made a lot of seeds.
[10:56.350 --> 10:58.630]  Then I started posting pictures to social media.
[10:58.630 --> 11:00.630]  A friend introduced me to Instagram.
[11:00.630 --> 11:03.990]  They're like, bro, you should put some of the pictures of that killer weed on Instagram.
[11:03.990 --> 11:04.990]  You'd get a good following.
[11:04.990 --> 11:07.150]  And I was like, yeah, I'm not really into that sort of shit.
[11:07.150 --> 11:08.870]  And they're like, you're missing out if you don't do it.
[11:08.870 --> 11:11.630]  So I thought I better post some pictures.
[11:11.630 --> 11:16.590]  Started posting pictures of my plants and my dried buds and flowers to social media
[11:16.630 --> 11:18.630]  and people started saying, bro, your plants are amazing.
[11:18.630 --> 11:19.630]  Where can we get seeds?
[11:19.630 --> 11:21.070]  And I was like, I don't really sell seeds.
[11:21.070 --> 11:22.950]  I don't really sell seeds.
[11:22.950 --> 11:25.710]  And people were like, well, you need to sell us seeds.
[11:25.710 --> 11:26.990]  I didn't make that many seeds.
[11:26.990 --> 11:28.750]  I was just making enough for me to play with.
[11:28.750 --> 11:33.670]  I would give them and allegedly, possibly, well, let's just say I'd give them to my friends
[11:33.670 --> 11:36.070]  all over the nation and all over the places.
[11:36.070 --> 11:40.110]  People would have my seeds and they were growing them and they were having great results.
[11:40.110 --> 11:41.590]  So they were asking for more seeds.
[11:41.590 --> 11:44.350]  And so I made the seeds that I had made for myself.
[11:44.390 --> 11:48.270]  So I just went back and made larger batches and started giving them out to my friends.
[11:48.270 --> 11:53.310]  Then I put them in a bunch of bags and I labeled them with my email address and just what the
[11:53.310 --> 11:56.710]  cross was and a couple of hints of what I thought they would grow like.
[11:56.710 --> 12:01.990]  And I went to the very first High Times Cannabis Cup in Denver, Colorado, the first one they
[12:01.990 --> 12:02.990]  held in Denver.
[12:02.990 --> 12:08.710]  I went there and I passed out probably 500 free packs of seeds just thinking I was going
[12:08.710 --> 12:12.670]  to give them out to people because I had a lot of seeds and nothing to do with them.
[12:12.670 --> 12:13.670]  I was just giving them out.
[12:13.990 --> 12:14.990]  Thought it was kind of fun.
[12:14.990 --> 12:16.470]  It was just a gift to the world.
[12:16.470 --> 12:17.470]  I made a lot of seeds.
[12:17.470 --> 12:18.750]  I got what I need out of it.
[12:18.750 --> 12:20.030]  I have a lot.
[12:20.030 --> 12:21.270]  I'm not going to grow them.
[12:21.270 --> 12:23.990]  Here are some seeds for the people.
[12:23.990 --> 12:27.070]  Shortly thereafter, my inbox started blowing up.
[12:27.070 --> 12:31.150]  My friends that I'd been giving seeds to were posting pictures of their progress.
[12:31.150 --> 12:32.630]  People were impressed by that.
[12:32.630 --> 12:37.430]  So now third party, third layer people, I guess, were seeing the seeds that I had made.
[12:37.430 --> 12:39.430]  And they said, bro, where did you get those?
[12:39.430 --> 12:41.230]  And my friend said, this guy Ross DeJeff.
[12:41.230 --> 12:42.670]  And I wasn't even Ross DeJeff.
[12:42.670 --> 12:44.390]  I was just Jeff on the fucking Jeff.
[12:44.390 --> 12:47.390]  I was just fucking Jeff on the internet growing weed.
[12:47.390 --> 12:52.190]  So like my friend Ross DeJeff made these seeds and then fucking all those people contacted
[12:52.190 --> 12:53.190]  me.
[12:53.190 --> 12:56.390]  Then all those people that I gave seeds to with that cannabis cup, they started growing
[12:56.390 --> 12:58.690]  it and they started having good results.
[12:58.690 --> 13:01.670]  They started contacting me asking for more seeds.
[13:01.670 --> 13:04.030]  Then the same thing happened with their social media people.
[13:04.030 --> 13:05.710]  They started posting shit.
[13:05.710 --> 13:08.150]  Then social media really made it blow up.
[13:08.150 --> 13:09.750]  I was posting quality photos.
[13:09.750 --> 13:14.230]  My friends were growing quality products, posting quality photos, giving out probably
[13:14.230 --> 13:15.990]  500.
[13:15.990 --> 13:17.590]  They were somewhere between five and 10 packs.
[13:17.590 --> 13:22.430]  It was like five and 10, seven packs of seeds, maybe 12 packs of seeds randomly in a package.
[13:22.430 --> 13:26.630]  I'd walk around the cannabis cup and if I saw somebody holding like anything that hinted
[13:26.630 --> 13:30.350]  to me they were going to go home and grow weed, especially if they had clones or grow
[13:30.350 --> 13:33.470]  nutrients or a grow light, I just hand them a package of seeds.
[13:33.470 --> 13:34.470]  Now you've got everything you need.
[13:34.470 --> 13:36.590]  Go home and grow some weed.
[13:36.590 --> 13:41.470]  Passing out all those seeds really did very well for me to establish a name in the industry.
[13:41.470 --> 13:44.430]  I guess I kind of accidentally started my seed company.
[13:44.430 --> 13:47.550]  I started it out of pure passion.
[13:47.550 --> 13:48.910]  The seeds were made.
[13:48.910 --> 13:54.010]  This is why I believe it is successful, a big part of why I believe it is successful.
[13:54.010 --> 13:56.630]  It was an art that I made for myself.
[13:56.630 --> 13:59.230]  It wasn't something I was doing to make money.
[13:59.230 --> 14:01.950]  It wasn't a product I was trying to pay the bills with.
[14:01.950 --> 14:05.110]  It was something that I was frustrated with what I was buying.
[14:05.150 --> 14:09.470]  I wanted to make a quality product for myself that was tailor-made for myself.
[14:09.470 --> 14:13.590]  My favorite thing about growing from seed is I can find the phenotype that if I'm growing
[14:13.590 --> 14:16.390]  in a commercial grow, we'll find the phenotype for the commercial grow.
[14:16.390 --> 14:20.590]  If I'm going to grow in a grow tent, we'll find the phenotype for the grow tent.
[14:20.590 --> 14:23.750]  In a seed pack you can find variation and find what you'd like.
[14:23.750 --> 14:27.990]  I started breeding with those to find what I loved and started making stuff that I thought
[14:27.990 --> 14:32.310]  was great for me that worked for my grow environment and my situation.
[14:32.630 --> 14:40.470]  Luckily, fortunately, my situation, my environment was also a large part of the cannabis medical
[14:40.470 --> 14:42.150]  marijuana, the regular grower.
[14:42.150 --> 14:44.590]  It was their environment, their situation as well.
[14:44.590 --> 14:46.310]  They had a small home grow.
[14:46.310 --> 14:49.510]  They needed plants that would finish in a certain amount of time that were highly potent.
[14:49.510 --> 14:53.790]  They gave them huge yields that had a variety of flavors available on the menu.
[14:53.790 --> 14:56.150]  That's what they were looking for just like me.
[14:56.150 --> 15:00.190]  It just so happened that I was making a product that fit the market very well.
[15:00.230 --> 15:03.870]  There was a need and a demand for my product.
[15:03.870 --> 15:04.870]  I fell into it.
[15:04.870 --> 15:07.550]  It was right time, right place, lots of passion.
[15:07.550 --> 15:10.190]  I feel like if I would have thought, hey man, I need to pay the rent.
[15:10.190 --> 15:11.190]  What are we going to do?
[15:11.190 --> 15:12.350]  Let's invent a seed company.
[15:12.350 --> 15:13.350]  It would have failed.
[15:13.350 --> 15:14.350]  I would have done it wrong.
[15:14.350 --> 15:16.590]  I did this organically.
[15:16.590 --> 15:19.390]  I just did it and it happened.
[15:19.390 --> 15:23.430]  A lot of my information here is going to be from experience.
[15:23.430 --> 15:25.270]  Most of my knowledge is from experience.
[15:25.270 --> 15:29.470]  I honestly wish I would have had more business knowledge, but since you're starting from
[15:29.750 --> 15:33.830]  scratch, I can say get yourself a business advisor, accountant, and lawyer from the beginning
[15:33.830 --> 15:36.710]  to get all of your paperwork in line.
[15:36.710 --> 15:37.710]  That's how I got started.
[15:37.710 --> 15:41.310]  Let me make sure I covered all of my how I got started notes here.
[15:41.310 --> 15:45.150]  I was going to events and giving out lots of seeds.
[15:45.150 --> 15:48.030]  Every event that was possible to go to, cannabis cups.
[15:48.030 --> 15:49.950]  We used to have the cannabis cups here.
[15:49.950 --> 15:51.510]  We'd have the secret cup.
[15:51.510 --> 15:53.770]  We had the 7-10 cup.
[15:53.770 --> 15:56.630]  We would have the secret sash.
[15:56.630 --> 15:59.070]  We would have ... There were so many events.
[15:59.670 --> 16:03.790]  When cannabis first got medically legal and then recreationally legal here, we were doing
[16:03.790 --> 16:05.630]  events once a month at least.
[16:05.630 --> 16:07.350]  I would go pass out seeds.
[16:07.350 --> 16:09.190]  Then eventually it came to trading seeds.
[16:09.190 --> 16:11.910]  Then eventually it became to vending seeds.
[16:11.910 --> 16:15.390]  I used to be what I would call the backpack warrior.
[16:15.390 --> 16:18.950]  I would fill my backpack up with a bunch of seeds and just go to the events and sling
[16:18.950 --> 16:20.590]  seeds out of my backpack.
[16:20.590 --> 16:23.150]  One time I got kicked out of the cannabis cup because they're like, dude, you can't
[16:23.150 --> 16:24.150]  do that.
[16:24.150 --> 16:25.150]  Pay for a booth.
[16:25.150 --> 16:26.670]  I realized that's absolutely correct.
[16:26.670 --> 16:29.350]  I should be a damn grown up and pay for a booth.
[16:29.350 --> 16:35.230]  Right after that, a very well-known seed vendor invited me to be a part of their booth at
[16:35.230 --> 16:36.230]  an event.
[16:36.230 --> 16:38.630]  I realized that I could really do well at those events.
[16:38.630 --> 16:42.710]  I didn't need anybody to hold my hand and help me out, that I could just get my own
[16:42.710 --> 16:43.710]  booth.
[16:43.710 --> 16:46.590]  Then the next event I rented my own booth and things went crazy from there.
[16:46.590 --> 16:49.750]  I got all of the things it takes to build a trade show booth.
[16:49.750 --> 16:50.930]  We got the banner in the back.
[16:50.930 --> 16:54.730]  We got the tablecloth, all the stuff to make a booth look professional.
[16:54.730 --> 16:56.730]  From there, it was basically game on.
[16:56.730 --> 16:59.690]  Built a website, did all that shit.
[16:59.690 --> 17:03.330]  Going to all those events and passing shit out and meeting the people and then continuing
[17:03.330 --> 17:07.410]  to go to the events and put my face out in the community and shaking their hands and
[17:07.410 --> 17:10.710]  being there, that helps a lot with the brand.
[17:10.710 --> 17:11.970]  That's a lot of how it got going.
[17:11.970 --> 17:16.450]  Just being there, being part of the crew, just showing up, smoking with everybody and
[17:16.450 --> 17:18.690]  having seeds and being the guy.
[17:18.690 --> 17:19.690]  That's kind of how it all happened.
[17:19.690 --> 17:22.930]  I do have a bunch of notes here that we could get into.
[17:23.130 --> 17:25.490]  I wanted to get the organic part out of the way.
[17:25.490 --> 17:26.490]  I have a couple of questions.
[17:26.490 --> 17:27.770]  You've got a couple of options.
[17:27.770 --> 17:29.770]  You want to start a seed business.
[17:29.770 --> 17:36.090]  Do you want to sell your seeds in the retail shops only or do you want to sell them online?
[17:36.090 --> 17:41.770]  I don't think that doing both is a really good idea and an option.
[17:41.770 --> 17:44.970]  I know there's one company that does sell their seeds in their retail store and you
[17:44.970 --> 17:45.970]  can buy them online.
[17:45.970 --> 17:50.650]  There are a lot of legal loopholes and things around that, but you should probably pick
[17:50.650 --> 17:51.650]  one.
[17:51.650 --> 17:54.410]  Do you want to sell them in your stores or do you want to sell them online?
[17:54.410 --> 17:56.090]  That's the first thing to think about.
[17:56.090 --> 18:00.490]  If you sell them in the store, you have a lot of licensing to go around, a lot of overhead
[18:00.490 --> 18:04.170]  to cover, a lot of legalities to think about.
[18:04.170 --> 18:06.570]  There is a lot of advantages.
[18:06.570 --> 18:07.610]  You've got a storefront.
[18:07.610 --> 18:09.610]  People will just go there and buy your seeds.
[18:09.610 --> 18:13.490]  That is very easy, but they've got to be regulated seeds.
[18:13.490 --> 18:15.610]  There's a lot of rules around that.
[18:15.610 --> 18:18.150]  Then also people have to go there to buy your seeds.
[18:18.150 --> 18:21.030]  If you sell your seeds online, they can be sold.
[18:21.030 --> 18:24.850]  People could be buying my seeds right now from vendors while I'm here recording.
[18:24.850 --> 18:27.110]  While I'm editing this show, I may be making a sale.
[18:27.110 --> 18:29.630]  I don't even know about it because the seeds are online.
[18:29.630 --> 18:32.350]  They're being sold all over the place and the vendors are handling that for me.
[18:32.350 --> 18:34.350]  I don't have to touch them anymore.
[18:34.350 --> 18:35.350]  All that stuff is done.
[18:35.350 --> 18:38.310]  The seeds are being sold that way online.
[18:38.310 --> 18:42.550]  You can set up a website or you can set up your own seed brand and then just send the
[18:42.550 --> 18:45.270]  seeds to vendors and let them go that way.
[18:45.270 --> 18:46.270]  How do you want to do it?
[18:46.270 --> 18:49.270]  Do you want the brick and mortar storefront or do you want the online presence?
[18:49.270 --> 18:54.210]  It sounds like you want to do the store, which is going to be a lot more work, a lot of legalities
[18:54.210 --> 18:55.630]  it sounds like.
[18:55.630 --> 19:00.550]  I keep saying this, but now is the time to get some business education.
[19:00.550 --> 19:05.910]  Either get yourself a small business degree, learn a little bit about small business, or
[19:05.910 --> 19:08.550]  team up with a small business advisor.
[19:08.550 --> 19:10.390]  Also you're going to need a lawyer.
[19:10.390 --> 19:15.050]  Anytime you're involved in the cannabis business, anything selling anything, have a lawyer.
[19:15.050 --> 19:18.410]  Have somebody you can call for quick questions, big questions.
[19:18.410 --> 19:19.410]  Somebody that can help you out.
[19:19.410 --> 19:20.890]  A lot of shit is going to come up.
[19:20.890 --> 19:23.410]  Make sure that all of your paperwork gets filed legally.
[19:23.410 --> 19:28.270]  If you're going to start an LLC, a non-profit organization, whatever you decide to do, however
[19:28.270 --> 19:33.170]  you decide to do it, whichever works best for you, see your business advisor and whoever
[19:33.170 --> 19:37.250]  helps you fill this stuff out will have all that advice for you.
[19:37.250 --> 19:38.650]  There are things online that can help you.
[19:38.650 --> 19:43.010]  Nobody advertises with me for that, but there are websites that can help you do that.
[19:43.170 --> 19:48.090]  Make sure that you get a lawyer, an accountant, and a small business advisor or something
[19:48.090 --> 19:50.890]  like that to help you out so you can start off properly.
[19:50.890 --> 19:54.330]  I said it earlier, I wish that I had had some help when I got started.
[19:54.330 --> 19:55.650]  I didn't do everything correctly.
[19:55.650 --> 19:59.830]  It took a couple of years to kind of fix some things that I didn't do right at the start.
[19:59.830 --> 20:00.830]  Not a big deal.
[20:00.830 --> 20:04.570]  It's just business shit that had to be resolved, but paperwork and headaches could have been
[20:04.570 --> 20:07.490]  resolved had I done it correctly the first time.
[20:07.490 --> 20:11.810]  If you've already got a commercial grow or anything, you already know all this stuff.
[20:11.850 --> 20:13.490]  I'm not sure if you've got a dispenser.
[20:13.490 --> 20:14.490]  You want to start.
[20:14.490 --> 20:17.930]  Anyway, make sure you get advice, a lawyer, and an accountant.
[20:17.930 --> 20:19.330]  Those things all help you out.
[20:19.330 --> 20:21.490]  Then make sure that they're not friends.
[20:21.490 --> 20:25.410]  You don't want your lawyer and your accountant to be buddies.
[20:25.410 --> 20:28.310]  Then if the business advisor, you don't want them teaming up against you.
[20:28.310 --> 20:30.910]  Make sure that your money is being watched by everybody.
[20:30.910 --> 20:34.050]  Make sure they're all after each other because when they team up on you, that's when shit
[20:34.050 --> 20:35.970]  can go wrong.
[20:35.970 --> 20:39.250]  Lawyer up, get yourself an accountant, get that business advisor.
[20:39.650 --> 20:42.690]  You're going to have to build a reputation.
[20:42.690 --> 20:45.690]  That's one of the hardest parts about creating a seed company.
[20:45.690 --> 20:47.570]  Sure, you made a bunch of seeds.
[20:47.570 --> 20:48.570]  Now what?
[20:48.570 --> 20:49.570]  What are you going to do with them?
[20:49.570 --> 20:50.570]  Why does anybody want those seeds?
[20:50.570 --> 20:51.570]  What comes out of those seeds?
[20:51.570 --> 20:53.530]  Have you built a reputation?
[20:53.530 --> 20:55.570]  You're going to have to give away seeds.
[20:55.570 --> 20:56.770]  People are going to have to grow them.
[20:56.770 --> 20:58.730]  They're going to have to see what comes from them.
[20:58.730 --> 20:59.930]  You're going to have to grow them.
[20:59.930 --> 21:00.930]  That's the first step.
[21:00.930 --> 21:02.290]  Make seeds, grow them.
[21:02.290 --> 21:04.930]  Find something you know is worth putting to market.
[21:04.930 --> 21:06.290]  Then put it to market.
[21:06.290 --> 21:08.210]  Have it tested all over the place.
[21:08.210 --> 21:09.690]  We'll talk about testers in a little bit.
[21:09.690 --> 21:13.370]  Have it tested in so many different environment situations.
[21:13.370 --> 21:16.890]  Then if you feel like it's ready to go to market, put it out there.
[21:16.890 --> 21:19.130]  But you're going to have to build a reputation.
[21:19.130 --> 21:20.970]  Why does anybody want to buy your seeds?
[21:20.970 --> 21:21.970]  What do you offer?
[21:21.970 --> 21:24.130]  What do you bring to the table that's not already there?
[21:24.130 --> 21:27.990]  Of course, if you've got that storefront, people are coming in to buy product already.
[21:27.990 --> 21:29.170]  Maybe seeds are an up sale.
[21:29.170 --> 21:31.190]  Maybe they just happen to be looking for seeds.
[21:31.190 --> 21:33.010]  Maybe you're the only shop on the block with seeds.
[21:33.010 --> 21:34.010]  That always helps.
[21:34.010 --> 21:36.330]  But what is going to drive people to your brand?
[21:36.330 --> 21:37.610]  How do you build a reputation?
[21:38.010 --> 21:39.250]  How do you build a demand?
[21:39.250 --> 21:43.090]  And then once you've built a reputation and built a demand, how do you continue those
[21:43.090 --> 21:45.650]  people to keep coming back for your seeds?
[21:45.650 --> 21:48.010]  How do you create sustainability?
[21:48.010 --> 21:51.490]  You've always got to be creating new stuff, which means you've always got to have stuff
[21:51.490 --> 21:52.770]  out testing.
[21:52.770 --> 21:56.710]  As a breeder, the stuff that you see being released now, I've got stuff that will come
[21:56.710 --> 21:57.710]  out this fall.
[21:57.710 --> 22:00.490]  I'm not sure if it'll be late this year, early next year.
[22:00.490 --> 22:03.650]  But there is stuff coming out, what I'm calling, it'll be the winter.
[22:03.650 --> 22:04.650]  Stuff coming out the winter.
[22:04.690 --> 22:08.330]  Winter release was actually made last winter.
[22:08.330 --> 22:10.850]  So those seeds are finally being released.
[22:10.850 --> 22:13.130]  It took about a year to get them processed.
[22:13.130 --> 22:14.210]  I grew them.
[22:14.210 --> 22:15.330]  I made sure they're good.
[22:15.330 --> 22:16.650]  I sent them out to testers.
[22:16.650 --> 22:18.250]  The testers are growing them.
[22:18.250 --> 22:22.490]  Then I sent out a round of secondary testers to people like, hey, I think these are really
[22:22.490 --> 22:23.490]  killer.
[22:23.490 --> 22:24.490]  You should try these.
[22:24.490 --> 22:27.530]  To my bros who are good photographers and shit like that, they got them next.
[22:27.530 --> 22:29.310]  Now pretty soon, they're going to make it to market.
[22:29.310 --> 22:30.310]  It takes a year.
[22:30.310 --> 22:33.690]  So you've always got to be producing new crosses.
[22:33.730 --> 22:36.090]  You've got to be testing them and getting them out.
[22:36.090 --> 22:37.970]  And you've got to have a reliable product.
[22:37.970 --> 22:41.650]  It only takes one bad batch of seeds to ruin a breeder's reputation.
[22:41.650 --> 22:43.330]  I've seen it happen to you guys.
[22:43.330 --> 22:46.690]  If you pay attention to the seed game, you've seen people that were around for a long time,
[22:46.690 --> 22:50.170]  put out one or two bad batches of seeds, then they disappeared.
[22:50.170 --> 22:51.790]  Their reputation is shot.
[22:51.790 --> 22:52.790]  They're at the events.
[22:52.790 --> 22:55.030]  They used to have a line around the block for their booth.
[22:55.030 --> 22:58.330]  Now there's just a few people coming up because they ruined their reputation by putting out
[22:58.330 --> 23:00.970]  a few bad, one or two bad batches of seeds.
[23:00.970 --> 23:02.770]  So you've got to build a reputation.
[23:02.850 --> 23:04.210]  You've got to become relevant.
[23:04.210 --> 23:05.690]  Why do people want your seeds?
[23:05.690 --> 23:07.290]  How do people know who you are?
[23:07.290 --> 23:10.970]  Then once they've got one pack, why are they going to come back for another pack of seeds?
[23:10.970 --> 23:15.270]  You've got to build longevity and sustainability as a seed company.
[23:15.270 --> 23:17.410]  There's a lot of work to doing that.
[23:17.410 --> 23:20.970]  Now let's talk about, oh, another factor.
[23:20.970 --> 23:22.250]  It's oversaturated.
[23:22.250 --> 23:24.610]  There are a million seed companies out there.
[23:24.610 --> 23:30.570]  If you go to the larger vendors on the internet and you click on, let's just say seedsherenow.com,
[23:30.570 --> 23:36.490]  look at the vast amount of vendors, of retailers, of seed breeders that are on that website.
[23:36.490 --> 23:37.530]  It is overwhelming.
[23:37.530 --> 23:39.290]  There are a lot of people on there.
[23:39.290 --> 23:40.410]  It's oversaturated.
[23:40.410 --> 23:43.530]  So how are you going to stand out from an oversaturated market?
[23:43.530 --> 23:45.050]  I'm not trying to discourage you.
[23:45.050 --> 23:48.370]  I'm asking you the real questions that come up in a business meeting.
[23:48.370 --> 23:52.170]  Why does anybody want to buy your seeds?
[23:52.170 --> 23:55.170]  Why do you stand out from the plethora of other breeders?
[23:55.170 --> 23:59.450]  Why, not to sound egotistical, why does somebody want to buy your seeds over my seeds?
[24:00.450 --> 24:01.850]  My brand has been around for a while.
[24:01.850 --> 24:03.970]  My podcast has existed for six years.
[24:03.970 --> 24:06.490]  The seeds were around for much longer than that.
[24:06.490 --> 24:10.810]  I've got a six-year, at least six-year podcast, Head Start, on you where people know about
[24:10.810 --> 24:12.690]  my brand, have been seeing my stuff.
[24:12.690 --> 24:13.890]  Why do they want to buy yours?
[24:13.890 --> 24:15.730]  I'm not belittling or criticizing.
[24:15.730 --> 24:17.410]  I'm asking a real business question.
[24:17.410 --> 24:20.770]  What are you going to do to convince them to buy your seeds when mine are right there
[24:20.770 --> 24:22.770]  on the shelf next to them?
[24:22.770 --> 24:24.730]  That's just a real question in business.
[24:25.730 --> 24:31.570]  Let's work into part of the things that are required from a seed breeder.
[24:31.570 --> 24:36.210]  If you want to own a seed company, it will be a full-time commitment.
[24:36.210 --> 24:39.130]  This will be a job, a business.
[24:39.130 --> 24:43.010]  If you've already got a backup plan, you're not in it to win it.
[24:43.010 --> 24:44.290]  There is no way out.
[24:44.290 --> 24:45.810]  There's no other idea.
[24:45.810 --> 24:49.130]  If you're going to start a seed company, that is what you're going to be doing.
[24:49.130 --> 24:50.890]  It is a full-time job.
[24:50.890 --> 24:52.450]  It is a full commitment.
[24:52.490 --> 24:57.170]  It is a nine days a week, fucking 32-hour-a-day job.
[24:57.170 --> 25:00.370]  Sometimes when I'm recording podcasts, I'm just trying to get them done before the sun
[25:00.370 --> 25:01.930]  comes up in this window behind me.
[25:01.930 --> 25:07.130]  You have no idea how many hours a seed breeder, small business owner, puts in every week.
[25:07.130 --> 25:08.690]  I'm not complaining by any means.
[25:08.690 --> 25:09.690]  I love it.
[25:09.690 --> 25:10.690]  I'm my own boss.
[25:10.690 --> 25:12.410]  I work when I want, how I want.
[25:12.410 --> 25:15.090]  If I want to take a dab break, we take a dab break.
[25:15.090 --> 25:17.530]  That's just how it goes, but we get a lot of shit done.
[25:17.530 --> 25:20.570]  It's how it is owning your own business.
[25:20.690 --> 25:24.930]  Let's talk about just kind of a basic day of a small business owner.
[25:24.930 --> 25:25.930]  You get up.
[25:25.930 --> 25:26.930]  You do your normal morning routine.
[25:26.930 --> 25:27.930]  I don't know what you do.
[25:27.930 --> 25:28.930]  Get some food in you.
[25:28.930 --> 25:29.930]  Probably poop.
[25:29.930 --> 25:30.930]  Get some coffee.
[25:30.930 --> 25:31.930]  I don't drink coffee, but whatever.
[25:31.930 --> 25:32.930]  Get started.
[25:32.930 --> 25:33.930]  Then there is garden work to do.
[25:33.930 --> 25:36.090]  The first thing that I do is take care of the garden.
[25:36.090 --> 25:37.370]  The plants need attention.
[25:37.370 --> 25:41.970]  If it's the home grow, if it's a commercial grow, always knock out the plant work first
[25:41.970 --> 25:42.970]  thing.
[25:42.970 --> 25:46.810]  If I got to go to a commercial grow, sometimes I hit two commercial grows in a day.
[25:46.810 --> 25:48.530]  Go make sure that all the plants are good.
[25:48.530 --> 25:50.010]  Teach the staff what to do.
[25:50.450 --> 25:51.730]  Then I get back to my personal grow.
[25:51.730 --> 25:53.090]  Take care of the personal grow.
[25:53.090 --> 25:54.330]  The plants are done.
[25:54.330 --> 25:56.370]  Sometimes there's not much to do to the plants.
[25:56.370 --> 25:59.890]  Sometimes there are hours and hours of work to do to the plants.
[25:59.890 --> 26:01.290]  Maybe you have to do transplanting.
[26:01.290 --> 26:02.290]  Maybe you have to cut clones.
[26:02.290 --> 26:03.850]  You have to keep the plants alive.
[26:03.850 --> 26:04.850]  You have to breed them.
[26:04.850 --> 26:06.010]  You have to do all of the plant work.
[26:06.010 --> 26:07.010]  You have to harvest them.
[26:07.010 --> 26:08.930]  You have to get the seeds out of them.
[26:08.930 --> 26:11.730]  That's a lot of work to be done with the plants.
[26:11.730 --> 26:14.090]  Then after that, try to take a little bit of a break.
[26:14.090 --> 26:15.090]  Take a shower.
[26:15.090 --> 26:16.090]  Get cleaned up.
[26:16.090 --> 26:17.090]  Get all the work off of me.
[26:17.090 --> 26:18.530]  Then we do emails.
[26:18.530 --> 26:20.890]  There are a lot of emails to be handled.
[26:20.890 --> 26:21.890]  There are business emails.
[26:21.890 --> 26:24.210]  There are customer service emails.
[26:24.210 --> 26:25.330]  Businesses with vendors.
[26:25.330 --> 26:30.250]  I have so many emails I honestly cannot keep up and it's giving me anxiety just freaking
[26:30.250 --> 26:32.250]  thinking about it right now.
[26:32.250 --> 26:35.850]  That is a full-time job within its own, just answering emails.
[26:35.850 --> 26:37.530]  Then on top of that, there is social media.
[26:37.530 --> 26:40.970]  If you try to stay relevant on social media, that could take up a good portion of your
[26:40.970 --> 26:41.970]  day.
[26:41.970 --> 26:44.370]  I try to stay away from that because I can really get sucked in.
[26:44.370 --> 26:48.410]  I'm sure you notice when I do get sucked in, there's four or five pictures for like 30
[26:48.490 --> 26:50.170]  minutes just scrolling and posting.
[26:50.170 --> 26:53.450]  Then I realize I've just spent 30 or 40 minutes here on social media.
[26:53.450 --> 26:55.370]  I got to get back to work.
[26:55.370 --> 26:57.770]  Social media is like a part-time job in its own.
[26:57.770 --> 27:00.850]  We haven't even gotten halfway through the day yet.
[27:00.850 --> 27:06.210]  Then you have to have, I mentioned these people earlier, the accountant, the lawyer, the tax
[27:06.210 --> 27:09.610]  guy, the paralegal, and whoever else you've got on your team that you've got to check
[27:09.610 --> 27:13.250]  in with probably once a week, once every two weeks, at least once a month.
[27:13.250 --> 27:14.890]  You got to check in with the lawyer.
[27:14.890 --> 27:17.890]  You got to check in with the accountant at least once a month and see what's going on
[27:17.890 --> 27:18.890]  there.
[27:18.890 --> 27:22.090]  Check in with, touch all the bases, make sure everybody's still on your team.
[27:22.090 --> 27:23.530]  Make sure the taxes have been paid.
[27:23.530 --> 27:24.730]  Make sure that everything is current.
[27:24.730 --> 27:26.810]  Make sure all the licenses are up to date.
[27:26.810 --> 27:28.490]  Do all that good stuff.
[27:28.490 --> 27:30.210]  We're only up to lunchtime right now.
[27:30.210 --> 27:31.370]  We're still making phone calls.
[27:31.370 --> 27:33.130]  The plants have already been watered.
[27:33.130 --> 27:36.250]  We haven't even got to checking in with the web guy.
[27:36.250 --> 27:38.530]  There are website updates to be made.
[27:38.530 --> 27:39.530]  Then there's the art guy.
[27:39.530 --> 27:42.650]  I'm having new merchandise made and new seed packages designed.
[27:42.650 --> 27:44.050]  I've got to check in with the art guy.
[27:44.050 --> 27:45.050]  Big shout out to the art guy.
[27:45.050 --> 27:46.050]  Hope you're well, bro.
[27:46.050 --> 27:47.850]  Also fist bump to the web guy.
[27:47.850 --> 27:48.850]  Then there's the merch team.
[27:48.850 --> 27:53.450]  I've got to check in with customstickermakers.com and see if the stickers are being printed.
[27:53.450 --> 27:55.050]  Got to check on the t-shirts.
[27:55.050 --> 27:56.410]  Also got to check on the mood mats.
[27:56.410 --> 27:57.410]  Where are they?
[27:57.410 --> 27:58.850]  They said they were shipping those around the 15th.
[27:58.850 --> 28:02.090]  Here we are like the 27th and those definitely have not shipped.
[28:02.090 --> 28:04.170]  I haven't even gotten pictures of the proofs yet.
[28:04.170 --> 28:06.770]  Got to email them again and see where those things are.
[28:06.770 --> 28:09.650]  So there's just a bunch of things that you have to take care of.
[28:09.650 --> 28:12.370]  Then testers.
[28:12.370 --> 28:15.290]  Testers are a big part of being a successful seed company.
[28:15.290 --> 28:18.410]  You've got to develop a relationship with your testers.
[28:18.410 --> 28:22.410]  If I make a new cross, I know the parents of that cross.
[28:22.410 --> 28:26.970]  I know the grandparents of that cross and possibly the great grandparents on both sides.
[28:26.970 --> 28:30.610]  I should be able to grow that plant like a champion.
[28:30.610 --> 28:36.290]  I'm a professional grower with a lot of experience and I know all of the details of that plant.
[28:36.290 --> 28:38.690]  I've got the fucking cheat code for those seeds.
[28:38.690 --> 28:41.130]  I better be able to grow it like a pro.
[28:41.130 --> 28:44.010]  What I do is send those seeds out to my test crew.
[28:44.010 --> 28:45.290]  Big shout out to the test team.
[28:45.290 --> 28:46.690]  You guys know who you are.
[28:46.690 --> 28:51.170]  They're the people who run the seeds and their specific grow environments and show me what
[28:51.170 --> 28:52.850]  I really made.
[28:52.850 --> 28:56.770]  They're the people that are going to see what it grows like under this kind of light, with
[28:56.770 --> 29:01.610]  this humidity, with this type of nutrient, in a tent, in a basement, in a warehouse.
[29:01.610 --> 29:03.650]  They're going to see that sort of stuff for me.
[29:03.650 --> 29:08.450]  You've got to develop a relationship with your test crew, which again puts you back
[29:08.450 --> 29:13.050]  sitting at the desk, answering emails, doing FaceTime calls, checking the social media,
[29:13.050 --> 29:15.050]  checking in with all of the testers.
[29:15.050 --> 29:17.130]  The testers are a big part of the team.
[29:17.130 --> 29:20.030]  Without the testers, I would not have success.
[29:20.030 --> 29:21.770]  I would be years behind without the testers.
[29:21.770 --> 29:25.750]  I couldn't do all the testing that they do for me.
[29:25.750 --> 29:29.370]  Probably a thousand seeds went out to be tested in the past week.
[29:29.370 --> 29:32.850]  The testers are a big part of the team.
[29:32.850 --> 29:35.770]  If you're interested in testing, people are going to start emailing me now.
[29:35.770 --> 29:40.130]  There is a podcast all about testing, the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[29:40.130 --> 29:41.650]  Tester episode is available.
[29:41.650 --> 29:44.770]  Watch that before you send me a message asking about testing.
[29:44.770 --> 29:45.770]  Please check that one out.
[29:45.770 --> 29:47.130]  All the details are there.
[29:47.130 --> 29:48.130]  Then join the Discord.
[29:48.130 --> 29:49.730]  There's a tester tab.
[29:49.730 --> 29:50.970]  We'd love to see you there.
[29:50.970 --> 29:51.970]  Check us out.
[29:51.970 --> 29:52.970]  Come hang out.
[29:52.970 --> 29:53.970]  But watch the video first.
[29:53.970 --> 29:58.490]  We're only halfway through the day and we've only gotten to the testers.
[29:58.490 --> 29:59.610]  Then I do have a life.
[29:59.610 --> 30:00.910]  I've got a daughter.
[30:00.910 --> 30:02.330]  I've got friends.
[30:02.330 --> 30:04.610]  I've got people I want to hang out with and talk to.
[30:05.290 --> 30:07.930]  Sometimes I want to eat dinner and take a break.
[30:07.930 --> 30:12.250]  Being a seed breeder and owning a seed company, what I'm getting at is a full-time job.
[30:12.250 --> 30:13.250]  It's a full commitment.
[30:13.250 --> 30:18.690]  Unless you are in it to win it and fully dedicated, I really wouldn't suggest getting into that
[30:18.690 --> 30:21.130]  unless you can commit to it.
[30:21.130 --> 30:24.090]  Another thing we should talk about is building a fan base.
[30:24.090 --> 30:28.050]  We've talked about this earlier a little bit, becoming relevant.
[30:28.050 --> 30:29.770]  Why do people want to buy your seeds?
[30:29.770 --> 30:32.290]  Then once you've got them, how do you retain them?
[30:32.330 --> 30:36.210]  If you can develop a solid fan base of just a solid number.
[30:36.210 --> 30:42.090]  I have approximately 200 Patreon supporters and there's about 500 to 1,000 people that
[30:42.090 --> 30:43.970]  really support me very strongly.
[30:43.970 --> 30:46.490]  There's a close group of 250 people.
[30:46.490 --> 30:50.530]  If anything I put out, if it's a grinder, a t-shirt, a pack of seeds, they'll grab it
[30:50.530 --> 30:51.610]  right away.
[30:51.610 --> 30:56.530]  Then there's a group of about 500 people, the fringe, that buy a lot of stuff.
[30:56.530 --> 30:59.970]  Then there's 1,000 people that buy enough.
[30:59.970 --> 31:05.010]  If you can just build a nice little following like that, that will help sustain you.
[31:05.010 --> 31:07.770]  Don't worry about going major too fast.
[31:07.770 --> 31:09.810]  Slowly build and have a loyal following.
[31:09.810 --> 31:13.170]  Try to make some friends that are in your fan base.
[31:13.170 --> 31:16.330]  I hate even calling them fan base or following, but you guys know what I mean.
[31:16.330 --> 31:20.450]  It's the people that follow you on social media, that interact with you the most online.
[31:20.450 --> 31:21.730]  Start learning some of those people.
[31:21.730 --> 31:22.930]  Start building relationships.
[31:22.930 --> 31:24.810]  That's why I go hang out in the Discord.
[31:24.810 --> 31:26.130]  I've got friends on the Discord.
[31:26.130 --> 31:27.890]  You guys are my friends.
[31:27.890 --> 31:31.210]  They know shit about my personal life that you guys that watch the podcast don't care
[31:31.210 --> 31:35.290]  about or have no idea about, but we know what's going on in each other's lives.
[31:35.290 --> 31:39.890]  I get pictures of my friends at other friends' houses trimming iri genetic strains.
[31:39.890 --> 31:40.890]  That is super cool.
[31:40.890 --> 31:42.890]  Big shout out to Lollipop Farms.
[31:42.890 --> 31:45.010]  But build a relationship with those people.
[31:45.010 --> 31:49.330]  The testers and the loyal fan base, they keep me afloat.
[31:49.330 --> 31:50.330]  They keep life going.
[31:50.330 --> 31:51.890]  They keep the wheels turning.
[31:51.890 --> 31:54.290]  You've got to be grateful and loyal to them.
[31:54.290 --> 31:55.970]  You've got to show love back to them.
[31:56.050 --> 31:57.770]  It's like a band.
[31:57.770 --> 32:01.690]  Those people down in the front that are in the mosh pit for every fucking show, you've
[32:01.690 --> 32:05.370]  got to throw them some t-shirts every once in a while and help them out because they're
[32:05.370 --> 32:07.170]  the people that make you successful.
[32:07.170 --> 32:09.210]  Without them, you would not exist.
[32:09.210 --> 32:13.370]  Without my fan base, without the people watching this, without the people watching the podcast,
[32:13.370 --> 32:17.830]  I would just be some psychopath with two cameras, a microphone, and way too many fucking toys.
[32:17.830 --> 32:18.970]  This would be weird.
[32:18.970 --> 32:21.570]  Without the people buying the seeds, I would not be successful.
[32:21.570 --> 32:22.810]  I would not eat dinner.
[32:22.810 --> 32:24.130]  I'd be skinnier.
[32:24.130 --> 32:25.370]  I wouldn't have a nice shirt.
[32:25.370 --> 32:26.610]  I'd look like shit.
[32:26.610 --> 32:28.090]  Life wouldn't be what it is.
[32:28.090 --> 32:32.050]  You've got to show love to the people that show you love when you become a successful
[32:32.050 --> 32:33.050]  business owner.
[32:33.050 --> 32:34.290]  Don't forget where you came from.
[32:34.290 --> 32:38.170]  Don't forget the people that make you who you are.
[32:38.170 --> 32:41.690]  Remember that the day you get started with this idea of making a seed company, you are
[32:41.690 --> 32:45.050]  already working on your reputation as that seed company.
[32:45.050 --> 32:49.450]  The people that already know you are putting your character and your reputation into your
[32:49.450 --> 32:51.070]  seed company.
[32:51.070 --> 32:52.070]  Start strong.
[32:52.070 --> 32:53.410]  Start off correctly.
[32:53.410 --> 32:55.090]  Don't cut corners.
[32:55.090 --> 32:57.170]  Make quality products.
[32:57.170 --> 32:58.870]  Be fair with your customers.
[32:58.870 --> 33:00.170]  Have quality customer service.
[33:00.170 --> 33:05.130]  Did I mention that I spend about at least an hour or two every day answering customer
[33:05.130 --> 33:06.130]  service emails?
[33:06.130 --> 33:08.890]  A lot of people are going to say, no, he doesn't because he doesn't reply to me.
[33:08.890 --> 33:13.330]  I've got about 30,000 emails that I try to answer and it's overwhelming because every
[33:13.330 --> 33:16.690]  time you answer them, they reply and you have more emails.
[33:16.690 --> 33:20.570]  I love you guys and I'm not mad about it, but I'm a one-person operation.
[33:20.570 --> 33:22.690]  I do the podcast, the seed company.
[33:22.690 --> 33:23.690]  I've got a daughter.
[33:23.690 --> 33:24.690]  I've got friends.
[33:25.290 --> 33:26.290]  I've got shit going on.
[33:26.290 --> 33:27.690]  Trying to keep up with it all.
[33:27.690 --> 33:29.330]  Thank you for keeping me overloaded.
[33:29.330 --> 33:34.610]  Anyway, the main part of this question was how might one go about setting up a seed company
[33:34.610 --> 33:36.330]  legally and a medical state?
[33:36.330 --> 33:38.210]  That is a great question.
[33:38.210 --> 33:40.150]  The first advice, lawyer up.
[33:40.150 --> 33:41.150]  Get that accountant.
[33:41.150 --> 33:42.330]  Get that business advisor.
[33:42.330 --> 33:46.210]  Make sure they are on your team guiding you so that you don't make any legal mistakes
[33:46.210 --> 33:47.690]  and get yourself in trouble.
[33:47.690 --> 33:51.650]  Then breed high quality, highly tested products.
[33:51.650 --> 33:53.090]  That's what your goal is.
[33:53.090 --> 33:56.930]  Breed the product that you are proud to put out to your consumer.
[33:56.930 --> 34:00.610]  If you're not proud to put it out, if you wouldn't be happy buying it, don't put it
[34:00.610 --> 34:02.250]  out to your consumer.
[34:02.250 --> 34:06.530]  Build a loyal fan base, connect with them, and then stay relevant.
[34:06.530 --> 34:07.810]  Then think about the future.
[34:07.810 --> 34:11.450]  I don't know the future of seed breeding and the future of seed purchasing and the future
[34:11.450 --> 34:12.530]  of cannabis.
[34:12.530 --> 34:16.090]  Try to project that and try to stay on top of it.
[34:16.090 --> 34:19.430]  Something that I have done, I try not to fuck with the hype.
[34:19.430 --> 34:21.610]  There are enough people out there doing the hype shit.
[34:21.610 --> 34:23.530]  I try to dodge that and do my own thing.
[34:23.530 --> 34:28.130]  Again, that is why I think it works because I'm not doing what everybody else is doing,
[34:28.130 --> 34:29.530]  what everybody else wants.
[34:29.530 --> 34:34.450]  I'm doing what is working for me, what I love, and then my art is showing that I'm putting
[34:34.450 --> 34:38.690]  passion into it and that makes it desirable and successful.
[34:38.690 --> 34:41.810]  Bottom line, bro, grow from your heart and breed with love.
[34:41.810 --> 34:43.130]  Do what you love.
[34:43.130 --> 34:44.130]  Stay out of trouble.
[34:44.130 --> 34:46.970]  I hope I gave you a lot of good advice because I got super rambly.
[34:46.970 --> 34:50.190]  I feel like this is a topic I could really ramble about.
[34:50.190 --> 34:55.230]  Get that lawyer, get that accountant, get the business advisor, then breed, breed, breed,
[34:55.230 --> 35:00.070]  test, test, test, then package them up, put them on the shelf, and get them out there
[35:00.070 --> 35:01.150]  to the people, bro.
[35:01.150 --> 35:04.550]  Always be available for customer service questions.
[35:04.550 --> 35:06.150]  Always be available for events.
[35:06.150 --> 35:11.110]  If people want to put you on shows and interview you, be available for those types of things.
[35:11.110 --> 35:12.490]  That camera just cut out.
[35:12.490 --> 35:13.630]  My voice is burning out.
[35:13.630 --> 35:16.350]  It is obviously time to wrap up this podcast.
[35:16.350 --> 35:20.030]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone
[35:20.030 --> 35:23.830]  cutters, and pollen chuckers, thank you once again for listening to me ramble on another
[35:23.830 --> 35:26.750]  episode of this podcast.
[35:26.750 --> 35:30.130]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, I would love to hear from you.
[35:30.130 --> 35:33.590]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[35:33.590 --> 35:34.590]  Don't be shy.
[35:34.590 --> 35:35.590]  Send me that feedback.
[35:35.590 --> 35:36.790]  Send me those questions.
[35:36.790 --> 35:39.150]  Big shout out to my buddy Danny Potts for this great question.
[35:39.150 --> 35:41.510]  I hope I helped you out, bro.
[35:41.510 --> 35:45.270]  For anything else, check out the website, iRegenetics.com.
[35:45.270 --> 35:48.630]  Everything you need is right there, iRegenetics.com.
[35:48.630 --> 35:50.150]  That's all I've got for you for this episode.
[35:50.150 --> 35:52.030]  I'll be back in a few days with fresh new content.
[35:52.030 --> 35:58.350]  I want to give a big shout out to all of my friends at the Neighborhood Grows Podcast.
[35:58.350 --> 36:01.790]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
