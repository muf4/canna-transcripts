[00:01.080 --> 00:18.370]  It's time for episode number 181 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:18.370 --> 00:27.370]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.370 --> 00:28.370]  That's right.
[00:28.370 --> 00:31.810]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:31.810 --> 00:36.050]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:36.050 --> 00:40.090]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:40.090 --> 00:42.010]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:42.010 --> 00:44.090]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:44.090 --> 00:47.530]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:47.530 --> 00:49.530]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.530 --> 00:53.530]  Big shout out to Kat, Kool, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.530 --> 00:59.610]  Yeah, I hope you guys are having a great day, great morning, evening, nighttime, whatever
[00:59.610 --> 01:00.610]  time it is, wherever you are.
[01:00.610 --> 01:02.130]  I hope you're having a great time.
[01:02.130 --> 01:03.730]  I hope you're smoking something with me.
[01:03.730 --> 01:06.370]  I'm smoking some Cascade Shatter.
[01:06.370 --> 01:07.370]  I grew the flowers.
[01:07.370 --> 01:09.730]  My friend, the Barefoot Grower, did the extraction for me.
[01:09.730 --> 01:13.090]  I want to give a huge shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass for keeping me supplied with
[01:13.090 --> 01:14.090]  fresh, clean glass.
[01:14.090 --> 01:18.290]  Also, I need to give a huge shout out to my friend Tater.
[01:18.290 --> 01:20.050]  Big shout out to Tater Glass for the custom pencil.
[01:20.050 --> 01:25.290]  I've got a brand new Rasta colored pencil dabber with a custom carb cap at the end of
[01:25.290 --> 01:26.570]  it so I can carb my banger.
[01:26.570 --> 01:27.570]  Big shout out to Tater Glass.
[01:27.570 --> 01:30.850]  Also, big shout out to Jenny Beth for the amazing Valentine's Day gift.
[01:30.850 --> 01:31.850]  Thank you.
[01:31.850 --> 01:32.850]  I appreciate that very much.
[01:32.850 --> 01:34.410]  I've been using the shit out of this thing.
[01:34.410 --> 01:35.410]  It is super sticky.
[01:35.410 --> 01:36.410]  I'll probably clean it.
[01:36.410 --> 01:39.730]  Big shout out to all the folks that take good care of me.
[01:39.730 --> 01:40.730]  Yeah.
[01:40.730 --> 01:44.450]  Since I'm doing shout outs, let's give a shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:44.450 --> 01:45.450]  That's right.
[01:45.450 --> 01:48.890]  If you need some hoodies printed, if you need t-shirts printed, if you need stickers made,
[01:48.890 --> 01:53.930]  if you need hat pins made, I can't recommend anyone better than my friends at Handmade
[01:53.930 --> 01:54.930]  Apparel.
[01:54.930 --> 01:55.930]  That's right.
[01:55.930 --> 01:56.930]  Handmade Apparel.
[01:56.930 --> 01:57.930]  They make my Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[01:57.930 --> 02:00.130]  They make the iRegenetics t-shirts.
[02:00.130 --> 02:02.710]  They've made my iRegenetics hat pins.
[02:02.710 --> 02:05.990]  They make most of my friends' t-shirts in the cannabis industry.
[02:05.990 --> 02:08.350]  They make a lot of the hat pins you see in the cannabis industry.
[02:08.350 --> 02:11.550]  You guys, I fully recommend Handmade Apparel.
[02:11.550 --> 02:15.270]  Check them out at HandmadeApparel.biz and let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[02:15.270 --> 02:18.590]  Let them know you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and they will take
[02:18.590 --> 02:22.110]  very good care of you on your custom printing needs.
[02:22.110 --> 02:24.110]  All right.
[02:24.110 --> 02:29.710]  This episode is going to be part two of preventing, identifying, and eradicating your common garden
[02:29.710 --> 02:30.710]  pests and issues.
[02:30.710 --> 02:31.710]  Wow, that's hard to say.
[02:31.710 --> 02:35.590]  That's a lot of words for a podcast title, but this is going to be part two of all that
[02:35.590 --> 02:36.590]  stuff.
[02:36.590 --> 02:41.430]  Before we get to talking about new issues, I need to mention some stuff I forgot in the
[02:41.430 --> 02:42.430]  last episode.
[02:42.430 --> 02:47.590]  In the last episode, we talked about fungus gnats and we also talked about spider mites.
[02:47.590 --> 02:52.110]  When we spoke about spider mites, I forgot to mention one helpful thing.
[02:52.110 --> 02:55.990]  You guys, if you start seeing spider mite webbing developing in your plants, you can
[02:55.990 --> 02:58.630]  easily vacuum it up with a shop vac.
[02:58.630 --> 03:02.590]  Hang onto the plant very carefully, get the shop vac, and just suck those spider mite
[03:02.590 --> 03:04.310]  webs right the fuck off of there.
[03:04.310 --> 03:07.470]  Honestly, if you've got spider mite webs, you've got big problems.
[03:07.470 --> 03:08.790]  You need to get through that harvest.
[03:08.790 --> 03:12.030]  You need to clean that up and then you need to figure out why there are spider mites in
[03:12.030 --> 03:13.030]  your grow.
[03:13.030 --> 03:14.030]  You need to correct that issue.
[03:14.030 --> 03:15.030]  You need to seal your gaps.
[03:15.030 --> 03:16.470]  You need to use some pesticides.
[03:16.470 --> 03:18.710]  You need to use some predator bugs.
[03:18.710 --> 03:22.790]  You need to get rid of the mites if you've got that big of an issue, but the shop vac
[03:22.790 --> 03:28.230]  will certainly work to help you clean up spider mite webbing should it be there in your grow.
[03:28.230 --> 03:30.310]  One more thing I should talk about.
[03:30.310 --> 03:35.390]  Another way to really easily find an issue in your garden is to be there every day and
[03:35.390 --> 03:36.390]  just take a look.
[03:36.390 --> 03:37.390]  You guys, pay attention.
[03:37.390 --> 03:38.610]  Look around in the grow.
[03:38.610 --> 03:39.790]  See what's going on.
[03:39.790 --> 03:40.790]  Look at the plants.
[03:40.790 --> 03:42.470]  Everybody stares into the plants all day.
[03:42.470 --> 03:43.670]  Stare with a purpose.
[03:43.670 --> 03:44.670]  Look at the leaves.
[03:44.670 --> 03:45.910]  See if you see any stippling.
[03:45.910 --> 03:47.430]  See if you see little bugs.
[03:47.430 --> 03:48.430]  Tap the soil.
[03:48.430 --> 03:50.070]  See if bugs fly up out of the soil.
[03:50.070 --> 03:51.070]  Shake the plants.
[03:51.070 --> 03:53.150]  See if bugs fly up out of the foliage.
[03:53.150 --> 03:54.150]  Look around the room.
[03:54.150 --> 03:56.510]  See if anything looks out of place.
[03:56.510 --> 03:59.710]  Look and see if you have some sort of leak or drip coming from an air conditioner or
[03:59.710 --> 04:00.710]  a dehumidifier.
[04:00.710 --> 04:01.710]  Just pay attention.
[04:01.710 --> 04:06.830]  The best way to find an issue early is to look every day and pay attention and be there.
[04:06.830 --> 04:08.470]  All you got to do is go there and look around.
[04:08.470 --> 04:09.470]  All right?
[04:09.470 --> 04:10.470]  Just pay some attention.
[04:10.470 --> 04:11.470]  Take some time in the grow.
[04:11.470 --> 04:13.870]  I like to walk in and just pull a leaf from a random plant.
[04:13.870 --> 04:16.070]  I try to pick a different plant every day.
[04:16.070 --> 04:18.290]  Pick one leaf, flip it upside down.
[04:18.290 --> 04:21.430]  Make sure there are no bugs, no issues on the bottom side of that leaf.
[04:21.430 --> 04:22.430]  Turn it.
[04:22.430 --> 04:23.430]  Look at the top side of the leaf.
[04:23.430 --> 04:24.430]  There's hardly ever problems on the top sides.
[04:24.430 --> 04:26.270]  You can see it from far away if there are.
[04:26.310 --> 04:27.310]  Grab some leaves.
[04:27.310 --> 04:28.310]  Pull them off the plants.
[04:28.310 --> 04:31.150]  Take a look and see if you notice any issues.
[04:31.150 --> 04:36.390]  Okay, another really easy and simple way to prevent problems in your garden is to simply
[04:36.390 --> 04:38.230]  clean up after yourself.
[04:38.230 --> 04:39.630]  Don't leave leaves on the floor.
[04:39.630 --> 04:40.910]  Don't leave dirt on the floor.
[04:40.910 --> 04:42.750]  Don't leave your tools in the grow room.
[04:42.750 --> 04:46.350]  And if you bought some soil and you plan on doing some transplanting, don't bring that
[04:46.350 --> 04:50.870]  soil into the grow room until you can properly treat it and be sure that there are not bugs
[04:50.870 --> 04:51.870]  in it.
[04:51.870 --> 04:55.910]  I should mention that a lot of soil that you purchase comes with free insects.
[04:56.550 --> 04:59.430]  A lot of people complain about specific brands having insects in it.
[04:59.430 --> 05:04.070]  Honestly, all of the soil is eventually stored in the same place.
[05:04.070 --> 05:08.550]  If whatever brand you choose, if it's Fox Farms, if it's Roots Organics, if it's whoever
[05:08.550 --> 05:09.910]  else, those are just the first two I thought of.
[05:09.910 --> 05:14.470]  If it's brand A, brand B, and brand C, they are all made by different companies, right?
[05:14.470 --> 05:19.470]  But then they're all put on a truck and they are all sent to whatever King fucking hydro
[05:19.470 --> 05:21.030]  supply in whatever place.
[05:21.030 --> 05:25.710]  And they're all stored in one warehouse there until they're shipped out to smaller warehouses
[05:25.710 --> 05:27.110]  to retail stores.
[05:27.110 --> 05:29.110]  So they're all shipped to one place.
[05:29.110 --> 05:32.270]  And in that one place, I imagine it's just a fucking bug farm.
[05:32.270 --> 05:36.910]  Every thrip and fungus net and spider mite is just in there plotting to take over your
[05:36.910 --> 05:37.910]  garden right now.
[05:37.910 --> 05:40.150]  So when new soil comes, you have to pay attention to what's in there.
[05:40.150 --> 05:41.990]  That's a great way to get bugs.
[05:41.990 --> 05:43.990]  I forgot to mention that in the last episode.
[05:43.990 --> 05:47.630]  So be clean and pay the fuck attention.
[05:47.630 --> 05:49.150]  One more thing we should talk about.
[05:49.150 --> 05:50.990]  A lot of people were like, hey, what about ladybugs?
[05:50.990 --> 05:54.390]  Can't I use ladybugs in my garden to help keep pests away?
[05:54.550 --> 05:58.430]  Ladybugs are really cute, but they are not that aggressive.
[05:58.430 --> 06:04.830]  I don't feel that they eat enough, uh, enough problematic bugs to be worth their money.
[06:04.830 --> 06:08.750]  If you do get some ladybugs, release them in the grow, take a bunch of photography because
[06:08.750 --> 06:09.950]  they're really cute.
[06:09.950 --> 06:13.790]  And then in the next morning, get out the shop vac and vacuum up all the dead goddamn
[06:13.790 --> 06:18.430]  ladybugs because most of them are going to die within the first 24 to 48 hours.
[06:18.430 --> 06:22.990]  They're really not that useful in my opinion, in an indoor grow.
[06:22.990 --> 06:24.270]  When they die, they stink.
[06:24.270 --> 06:25.270]  You step on them.
[06:25.270 --> 06:26.270]  They're crunchy.
[06:26.270 --> 06:27.310]  You find them in your ducting.
[06:27.310 --> 06:29.990]  You find them all over the place.
[06:29.990 --> 06:33.790]  Also you guys, I don't really think a praying mantis is too beneficial in a garden.
[06:33.790 --> 06:36.590]  They mostly eat things like aphids and soft bodied insects.
[06:36.590 --> 06:38.590]  They won't really go after too many spider mites.
[06:38.590 --> 06:39.590]  They aren't that aggressive.
[06:39.590 --> 06:44.990]  What I'm getting at is if you are going to employ predator insects, it is way more worth
[06:44.990 --> 06:51.310]  your time, your budget, and your energy to research and purchase the correct predatory
[06:51.310 --> 06:53.430]  insect for your problem.
[06:53.430 --> 07:00.030]  For every insect that I mention in these problem episodes, I'm going to try to include a predatory
[07:00.030 --> 07:04.350]  insect that will control that pest problem.
[07:04.350 --> 07:08.750]  Eventually I'll do a full episode focused on beneficial insects and predator bugs, but
[07:08.750 --> 07:12.950]  for now I'll just include one or two predators for each problem that we face.
[07:12.950 --> 07:18.190]  You guys, if you are looking to employ and use predator mites and sort of an integrated
[07:18.190 --> 07:23.030]  pest management system and go the organic route, I can fully endorse a company called
[07:23.030 --> 07:24.390]  Arbico Organics.
[07:24.390 --> 07:27.630]  It's A-R-B-I-C-O Organics.
[07:27.630 --> 07:30.750]  They are available online at arbico-organics.com.
[07:30.750 --> 07:31.750]  They do not pay me.
[07:31.750 --> 07:38.170]  I am not sponsored by them, but this one simple catalog, this is the early spring 2017 catalog.
[07:38.170 --> 07:44.430]  It includes beneficial insects and mites to combat almost any problem I could imagine
[07:44.430 --> 07:45.430]  in a garden.
[07:45.430 --> 07:49.790]  They are mite predators, they're whitefly parasites, they're aphid parasites.
[07:49.790 --> 07:54.630]  You can buy anything from ladybugs and praying mantises to minute pirate bugs to assassin
[07:54.630 --> 07:59.990]  bugs, which we will talk about in the IPM episode, which I do have coming up for you.
[07:59.990 --> 08:03.710]  Ladies and gentlemen, my point here is that I do completely endorse Arbico Organics.
[08:03.710 --> 08:08.230]  You guys, another way that you can pay attention and notice bugs before they become a problem
[08:08.230 --> 08:10.430]  is yellow and blue sticky traps.
[08:10.430 --> 08:12.030]  I said blue also, yes.
[08:12.030 --> 08:14.230]  Most people know about the yellow sticky traps for your garden.
[08:14.230 --> 08:17.270]  Let me talk about yellow sticky traps for a second.
[08:17.270 --> 08:20.910]  The reason yellow sticky traps are yellow is because bugs are attracted to the yellowing
[08:20.910 --> 08:21.910]  leaves.
[08:21.910 --> 08:23.550]  The yellowing leaves are a sign of weakness.
[08:23.550 --> 08:26.510]  Imagine you were a bug, you want to eat through the leaf.
[08:26.510 --> 08:30.190]  That thick green leaf is crunchy and it has protection on it.
[08:30.190 --> 08:33.990]  It's going to take a little more work to get to the crunchy, juicy, or that juicy, tasty
[08:33.990 --> 08:34.990]  insides.
[08:34.990 --> 08:37.930]  If the leaf is already yellow, it's a little bit weak and you can get your little fangs
[08:37.930 --> 08:42.430]  right through it and get in there and suck out the juices and get what you need.
[08:42.430 --> 08:45.390]  Bugs are programmed to want to head for those yellow leaves.
[08:45.390 --> 08:47.230]  Hang those yellow sticky traps up.
[08:47.230 --> 08:50.150]  I like to put one low near the bottom of the canopy.
[08:50.150 --> 08:51.830]  I like to put one in the middle of the canopy.
[08:51.830 --> 08:55.870]  Then I put them up high where flying bugs are going to go, up near the lights.
[08:55.870 --> 09:00.190]  I like to have those yellow sticky traps around to let me know if bugs are there.
[09:00.190 --> 09:03.270]  If I see insects gathering on those, a couple is fine.
[09:03.270 --> 09:05.270]  You're going to see a couple occasionally because shit flies around.
[09:05.270 --> 09:07.190]  You're just going to have a normal bug flying around.
[09:07.190 --> 09:10.770]  If you start seeing them gather on there, it's time to treat for whatever bug you see
[09:10.770 --> 09:11.770]  gathering on there.
[09:11.770 --> 09:15.090]  It's probably going to be a fungus gnat if it's something flying.
[09:15.090 --> 09:16.470]  The blue ones, put those lower.
[09:16.470 --> 09:20.050]  The blue sticky cards, put those lower near your soil and they will let you know if you're
[09:20.050 --> 09:21.050]  getting thrips.
[09:21.050 --> 09:26.090]  They are a good indicator of leaf miners and thrips and other soil-bound insects.
[09:26.090 --> 09:30.970]  The sticky traps are certainly a good way to let you know that insects are coming.
[09:30.970 --> 09:36.130]  Also, another good way to know that you've got bugs, flying bugs will stick to your lights.
[09:36.130 --> 09:38.470]  The light reflectors, they heat up.
[09:38.470 --> 09:41.330]  If you've got glass on there, that'll heat up.
[09:41.330 --> 09:43.410]  Somewhere there will be bugs stuck to that.
[09:43.410 --> 09:44.410]  Pay attention to that.
[09:44.410 --> 09:47.490]  If you see little black bugs or little white bugs, that means you've got fungus gnats or
[09:47.490 --> 09:50.190]  white flies that you have got to treat for.
[09:50.190 --> 09:54.310]  Those are really simple ways and indicators that you have got problems and very simple
[09:54.310 --> 09:56.330]  ways to prevent problems.
[09:56.330 --> 10:02.830]  Now, it's time to work our way into talking about preventing and eradicating and identifying
[10:02.830 --> 10:04.170]  more garden issues.
[10:04.170 --> 10:07.570]  Let's start today with white flies.
[10:07.610 --> 10:11.770]  White flies are more ugly than anything, but what white flies do is they make your plants
[10:11.770 --> 10:12.770]  weak.
[10:12.770 --> 10:14.170]  They will slow down the growth of your plant.
[10:14.170 --> 10:16.170]  They will make your plants weak and tired.
[10:16.170 --> 10:18.410]  They will certainly diminish your yield.
[10:18.410 --> 10:20.970]  They will diminish the quality of your plants.
[10:20.970 --> 10:24.330]  White flies like to stick their little teeth into your plants and suck the sap out of your
[10:24.330 --> 10:26.170]  plants and then they fly around.
[10:26.170 --> 10:29.010]  Then they land back on your plants and they shit all over your plants and leave little
[10:29.010 --> 10:31.030]  honeydew streaks on your plants.
[10:31.030 --> 10:32.310]  They make your plants weak.
[10:32.310 --> 10:35.850]  When you try to take photos, your photos are fucking ugly because you've got white flies
[10:35.850 --> 10:36.850]  in there.
[10:37.610 --> 10:39.330]  It's really frustrating.
[10:39.330 --> 10:41.210]  Let's talk about white flies.
[10:41.210 --> 10:44.090]  It sounds really easy to identify a white fly.
[10:44.090 --> 10:45.530]  White fly identification.
[10:45.530 --> 10:47.810]  They are little white bugs that fly around.
[10:47.810 --> 10:48.810]  How do you know they're there?
[10:48.810 --> 10:49.870]  They're flying around.
[10:49.870 --> 10:52.930]  If you don't see them, the best way to check for them, shake the plant.
[10:52.930 --> 10:56.550]  When you shake the plant, shake the foliage, white flies will take off flying.
[10:56.550 --> 10:58.690]  Like I said earlier, look around the light.
[10:58.690 --> 11:02.170]  Shake the plants and look toward the light because the little bugs want to fly right
[11:02.170 --> 11:03.970]  at the light when you shake them.
[11:03.970 --> 11:06.770]  Then they'll just fly around for a couple of seconds and they'll land right back on
[11:06.810 --> 11:07.810]  your plants.
[11:07.810 --> 11:08.810]  They're really frustrating.
[11:08.810 --> 11:11.330]  That's an easy way to identify them.
[11:11.330 --> 11:20.010]  A good way to prevent white flies is a clean, dry, sealed grow room and also low temperatures.
[11:20.010 --> 11:24.450]  White flies thrive and reproduce in temperatures over 80 degrees.
[11:24.450 --> 11:27.610]  Try to keep it closer to 75, 77 degrees in there.
[11:27.610 --> 11:31.090]  That will slow down the white fly production if they do get in there.
[11:31.090 --> 11:35.170]  Also, like I was talking about earlier, clear out all of the plant debris that you have
[11:35.170 --> 11:36.170]  in your room.
[11:37.170 --> 11:39.170]  Dead leaves and stuff, get rid of that.
[11:39.170 --> 11:44.010]  Also, in the last episode, I talked about using fine dust filters and HEPA filters on
[11:44.010 --> 11:47.210]  all of your ducting or on your intakes or on your outs.
[11:47.210 --> 11:51.610]  Make sure you have some sort of ducting on all your ins and outs and make sure that all
[11:51.610 --> 11:55.490]  of your vents are covered so that the white flies can't travel through there.
[11:55.490 --> 11:56.490]  That's a great way.
[11:56.490 --> 11:58.370]  Those are great ways to prevent white flies.
[11:58.370 --> 12:00.990]  Now you know how to spot them and you know how to prevent them.
[12:00.990 --> 12:05.810]  Now should you get them, let's talk about ways to get rid of white flies.
[12:06.450 --> 12:10.330]  Like I talked about a little bit ago, yellow sticky traps are a great way to start catching
[12:10.330 --> 12:14.050]  the white flies, but you're only going to get a small portion of what's there.
[12:14.050 --> 12:17.090]  Just the ones that fly to the yellow sticky traps, just the dumb ones.
[12:17.090 --> 12:18.330]  The dumb ones are going to fly right to it.
[12:18.330 --> 12:21.370]  The smart ones are going to stay there and they're going to keep breeding.
[12:21.370 --> 12:25.330]  Another way that you can get rid of them is to shake the plants and when they fly up,
[12:25.330 --> 12:26.730]  simply use your shop vac.
[12:26.730 --> 12:28.290]  I've done this before in gardens.
[12:28.290 --> 12:29.570]  I've done this in personal gardens.
[12:29.570 --> 12:32.670]  I have done this also in commercial gardens.
[12:32.670 --> 12:34.410]  Just shake the shit out of them.
[12:34.410 --> 12:38.450]  Shake the plant and just use the wand on the shop vac and as they fly out, just suck
[12:38.450 --> 12:39.450]  them up.
[12:39.450 --> 12:41.370]  They're going to fly right out of the plant and then they're going to fly right up to
[12:41.370 --> 12:42.370]  the light.
[12:42.370 --> 12:44.250]  So maybe keep the shop vac up toward the light.
[12:44.250 --> 12:45.250]  Just shop vac.
[12:45.250 --> 12:46.890]  Just suck them right up.
[12:46.890 --> 12:47.890]  Shake the plant.
[12:47.890 --> 12:48.890]  Keep sucking.
[12:48.890 --> 12:49.890]  Chase them around.
[12:49.890 --> 12:52.450]  Suck them up until you're bored, until your arms go tired or until they quit flying around.
[12:52.450 --> 12:54.170]  Do whichever one you got to do.
[12:54.170 --> 12:59.330]  So get out the shop vac and shop vac the shit out of those white flies.
[12:59.330 --> 13:02.290]  Also things you can do, you can apply sprays.
[13:02.290 --> 13:06.890]  You can use neem oil would work to help you get rid of your white flies.
[13:06.890 --> 13:10.970]  Pyrethrum sprays will help you get rid of your white flies and spinosad sprays will
[13:10.970 --> 13:13.290]  help you get rid of your white flies.
[13:13.290 --> 13:15.490]  Those are all things that are up to you.
[13:15.490 --> 13:19.370]  If you want to use the evergreen pyrethrin spray, it seems to be a very versatile product.
[13:19.370 --> 13:20.370]  You could spray the leaves.
[13:20.370 --> 13:23.970]  You can do a soil drench and that will get rid of most of your insects.
[13:23.970 --> 13:29.090]  I think two or three applications of the evergreen pyrethrums will get rid of most insects to
[13:29.090 --> 13:30.310]  tell you the truth.
[13:30.310 --> 13:33.770]  But that is up to you if it's something you want to do.
[13:33.770 --> 13:38.430]  Also if you've got a very small garden and a very light case of white flies, you can
[13:38.430 --> 13:39.870]  use insecticidal soap.
[13:39.870 --> 13:40.870]  There is safer soap.
[13:40.870 --> 13:43.830]  I think Ed Rosenthal makes his own type of soap.
[13:43.830 --> 13:47.030]  Simple products like that are great to use if you've got a light infestation.
[13:47.030 --> 13:50.750]  But also keep in mind, like I mentioned in every episode, everything you spray on your
[13:50.750 --> 13:53.650]  leaves is going to end up in your concentrates.
[13:53.650 --> 13:58.590]  So if you're going to apply essential oils or botanical extract oils, those are going
[13:58.590 --> 13:59.690]  to end up in your hash.
[13:59.690 --> 14:04.010]  If you plan on making hash, if you're making BHO, if you're making water hash, this stuff
[14:04.010 --> 14:05.730]  will end up in your concentrates.
[14:05.730 --> 14:07.450]  You're going to end up smoking it.
[14:07.450 --> 14:09.370]  You're going to end up tasting it.
[14:09.370 --> 14:11.370]  It may have a health effect.
[14:11.370 --> 14:13.250]  I do not know what product you're using.
[14:13.250 --> 14:15.370]  I don't know the long-term effects of these.
[14:15.370 --> 14:17.670]  Just keep that stuff in mind.
[14:17.670 --> 14:22.730]  Another thing that you can use to get rid of your white flies is a beneficial fungi
[14:22.730 --> 14:25.690]  and I think it is pronounced buvaria bassiana.
[14:25.690 --> 14:26.690]  It's a beneficial fungus.
[14:26.690 --> 14:28.530]  It can be applied in several different ways.
[14:28.530 --> 14:29.810]  It's sold as a powder.
[14:29.810 --> 14:31.130]  It can be sprinkled onto soil.
[14:31.130 --> 14:32.570]  It can be mixed with water.
[14:32.570 --> 14:36.170]  However you get it, please follow the instructions.
[14:36.170 --> 14:37.330]  Wear a mask if you use it.
[14:37.330 --> 14:38.330]  Wear gloves.
[14:38.330 --> 14:39.330]  Wear goggles.
[14:39.330 --> 14:41.330]  Please, you guys, this is a horticultural product.
[14:41.330 --> 14:43.610]  Please be very careful with this stuff.
[14:43.610 --> 14:44.610]  It is not a joke.
[14:44.610 --> 14:50.090]  Okay, now is the time when we talk about the beneficial insects that you can use to get
[14:50.090 --> 14:51.090]  rid of your white flies.
[14:51.090 --> 14:54.890]  If you do not want to apply pesticides, if you do not want to get out the shop vac, you
[14:54.890 --> 14:56.690]  guys get out the shop vac and just suck the shit out of them.
[14:56.690 --> 14:57.690]  It won't hurt anything.
[14:57.850 --> 14:58.850]  Beat the shit out of your plants.
[14:58.850 --> 14:59.850]  It's kind of good for them.
[14:59.850 --> 15:03.170]  If you don't want to apply pesticides, if you don't want to use beneficial funguses,
[15:03.170 --> 15:08.490]  if you don't want to put spinosad on your plants, one thing you really can do is get
[15:08.490 --> 15:10.770]  white fly parasites.
[15:10.770 --> 15:15.370]  There are one, two, three different types of white fly parasites available in the Arbico
[15:15.370 --> 15:17.970]  magazine and they are all very affordable.
[15:17.970 --> 15:23.050]  The white fly parasite I would recommend to you is called the Ancarsia formosa.
[15:23.050 --> 15:27.530]  They're actually little wasps that fly around your greenhouse and eat the shit out of white
[15:27.570 --> 15:28.570]  flies.
[15:28.570 --> 15:32.370]  Alright, you guys, that is my quick talk on how to get rid of white flies.
[15:32.370 --> 15:36.210]  Honestly, the best way to get rid of white flies is to prevent them.
[15:36.210 --> 15:38.210]  Keep your clothes clean if you've been to another grow.
[15:38.210 --> 15:39.850]  Keep your grow room sealed up.
[15:39.850 --> 15:43.290]  Keep your yellow sticky traps hung up and hopefully the little fuckers don't get in
[15:43.290 --> 15:44.290]  your grow.
[15:44.290 --> 15:49.310]  You guys, one thing I should mention, a common way that I have discovered pests in gardens
[15:49.310 --> 15:50.450]  is through photography.
[15:50.450 --> 15:53.690]  I am a huge cannabis photography enthusiast.
[15:54.410 --> 15:58.490]  Shameless plug, if you'd like to follow my Instagram, I am irie underscore genetics on
[15:58.490 --> 15:59.490]  Instagram.
[15:59.490 --> 16:03.730]  I R I E underscore G E N E T I C S.
[16:03.730 --> 16:05.090]  Irie genetics on Instagram.
[16:05.090 --> 16:07.970]  I post a ton of cannabis photography.
[16:07.970 --> 16:11.250]  Some of my recent posts have gotten nearly 500 likes so far.
[16:11.250 --> 16:14.090]  I'm at 480 something likes on a couple of posts.
[16:14.090 --> 16:15.530]  So if you want to check that out, go for it.
[16:15.530 --> 16:20.050]  But photography is how I discover a lot of issues and problems.
[16:20.050 --> 16:22.010]  I'll snap a picture at a grow.
[16:22.010 --> 16:23.130]  I'll zoom in real far.
[16:23.130 --> 16:24.130]  I'll snap a picture.
[16:24.130 --> 16:25.130]  I'll come home.
[16:25.130 --> 16:26.130]  I'll throw the disc in the computer.
[16:26.130 --> 16:29.490]  I'll open it up on the computer screen and zoom in thinking that I've got the most amazing
[16:29.490 --> 16:34.290]  shot and then I'll notice that there are some white flies or some fungus gnats or some aphids
[16:34.290 --> 16:39.090]  just crunched up in a corner on one of these buds that I did not even notice.
[16:39.090 --> 16:42.090]  And it ruined my photo, but at least now I know that there's a problem.
[16:42.090 --> 16:44.650]  There's something I need to treat for something I need to take care of.
[16:44.650 --> 16:48.290]  So if you've got a good camera, if you've got a decent camera, you could probably do
[16:48.290 --> 16:50.370]  this with your iPhone or Android camera.
[16:50.370 --> 16:54.690]  If you suspect you've got a problem, take some pictures, zoom in, look at the pictures
[16:54.690 --> 16:58.850]  when you zoom in and you may reveal some problems you were unaware of.
[16:58.850 --> 17:01.330]  All right, you guys, I've been going for 17 minutes here.
[17:01.330 --> 17:03.490]  It looks like I'm going to press pause for a second.
[17:03.490 --> 17:04.810]  I'm going to take a drink.
[17:04.810 --> 17:08.490]  You know, I'm going to take a couple of giant dabs and then I will be right back and we're
[17:08.490 --> 17:10.450]  going to talk about aphids.
[17:10.450 --> 18:00.410]  All right, podcast world, I am back and I am heavily medicated.
[18:00.410 --> 18:02.690]  I hope you enjoyed the music we're listening to during the break.
[18:02.690 --> 18:06.410]  The song I played was called Fat Spliffs by a band called Slightly Stupid.
[18:06.410 --> 18:10.050]  I'm sure a lot of my reggae friends are familiar with Slightly Stupid, but if you haven't heard
[18:10.050 --> 18:11.170]  of them, check them out.
[18:11.170 --> 18:13.210]  I'm sure you will dig them.
[18:13.210 --> 18:18.810]  During the break, you guys, I took some gigantic dabs of some distillate and I am heavily medicated.
[18:18.810 --> 18:20.850]  I like to talk about how much I enjoy shatter.
[18:20.850 --> 18:22.290]  I do like shatter.
[18:22.290 --> 18:27.330]  Shatter is probably the most cost effective way for me to medicate the way I prefer.
[18:27.330 --> 18:28.730]  I like to smoke frequently.
[18:28.730 --> 18:30.290]  I like to take large dabs.
[18:30.290 --> 18:35.810]  I feel like I get more medicinal effect off of one giant dab than I would three little
[18:35.810 --> 18:36.810]  dabs.
[18:36.810 --> 18:39.970]  If you took the same amount of hash, if you took, let's just say a half gram, I would
[18:39.970 --> 18:44.850]  smoke a half gram dab by itself instead of breaking it into three small dabs.
[18:44.850 --> 18:50.050]  I feel like if I smoked those three small dabs back to back, like inhale, blow it out,
[18:50.050 --> 18:55.770]  heat the rig up again, do it again, blow out the dab, heat the rig up again, smoke it in,
[18:55.770 --> 18:56.770]  blow it out, do it again.
[18:56.770 --> 19:02.050]  I think those three dabs back to back would not get me as high as one single half gram
[19:02.050 --> 19:03.050]  dab would do.
[19:03.050 --> 19:06.530]  If I took the same half grab, broke it down into three pieces, took them all or took one
[19:06.530 --> 19:10.170]  giant dab, I'd get way better medication off of the half gram.
[19:10.170 --> 19:13.290]  I like to take giant dabs and I like to do it frequently.
[19:13.290 --> 19:16.490]  I like to take two or three dabs at a time when I take a dab break.
[19:16.490 --> 19:19.490]  Sometimes I'll take four or five dabs at a time.
[19:19.490 --> 19:23.450]  Shatter is the most cost effective way for me to get the medicine I need for the price.
[19:23.450 --> 19:26.370]  I like to take big dabs very frequently.
[19:26.370 --> 19:30.010]  When I need a little extra, when I just want to do something extra to my head, you guys,
[19:30.010 --> 19:31.450]  this distillate is the way to go.
[19:31.450 --> 19:33.570]  It's a little bit expensive so you can't get down on it.
[19:33.570 --> 19:37.090]  You can't spoil yourself every day, but if you're trying to spend a little extra money
[19:37.090 --> 19:41.730]  at the dispensary, I highly recommend a nice glass vial of distillate.
[19:41.730 --> 19:43.930]  What I like to do, I heat up the banger.
[19:43.930 --> 19:48.090]  Heat the banger a little bit too hot or the nail, whichever you're using, or the e-nail.
[19:48.090 --> 19:49.490]  The e-nail is already on.
[19:49.490 --> 19:52.010]  Get it to a little bit hot and then let it cool.
[19:52.010 --> 19:55.810]  Then I just take the torch and just barely heat the tip of the glass syringe, which the
[19:55.810 --> 19:57.170]  distillate comes in.
[19:57.170 --> 20:00.250]  Then you just barely tap the plunger and it'll just push.
[20:00.250 --> 20:04.450]  I think three drops of distillate is a good dab for me.
[20:04.450 --> 20:07.170]  Sometimes I like to go four or five if I'm trying to go crazy.
[20:07.170 --> 20:10.330]  If you want to go big, go seven or eight or 10 drops of the distillate into the banger
[20:10.330 --> 20:11.330]  and do it.
[20:11.330 --> 20:14.570]  I think one or two drops, two or three drops would get most people choking and nice and
[20:14.570 --> 20:15.570]  high.
[20:15.570 --> 20:16.570]  Big shout out to distillate.
[20:16.570 --> 20:19.730]  I'm really starting to fall in love with distillate.
[20:19.730 --> 20:22.730]  You guys, I'm going to quit rambling about distillate and concentrates and we're going
[20:22.730 --> 20:25.330]  to talk about aphids.
[20:25.850 --> 20:27.210]  Aphids are very common in cannabis grows.
[20:27.210 --> 20:29.730]  They love warm environments and warm conditions.
[20:29.730 --> 20:31.810]  That's why you find them in a lot of ganja grows.
[20:31.810 --> 20:34.250]  That's why you find them in a lot of greenhouses.
[20:34.250 --> 20:37.370]  Let's talk about identifying aphids.
[20:37.370 --> 20:40.430]  Aphids are about the size of a piece of rice, I think.
[20:40.430 --> 20:41.490]  Maybe a little bit smaller.
[20:41.490 --> 20:43.330]  I've seen aphids plenty of times.
[20:43.330 --> 20:46.850]  They look like a piece of rice, maybe just a little bit smaller.
[20:46.850 --> 20:48.570]  They're pear shaped.
[20:48.570 --> 20:51.330]  Aphids come in many different colors.
[20:51.330 --> 20:52.570]  I have seen aphids.
[20:52.570 --> 20:53.730]  I've seen white aphids.
[20:53.730 --> 20:54.930]  I've seen orange aphids.
[20:54.930 --> 20:56.490]  I've seen green aphids.
[20:56.490 --> 21:01.490]  I've seen aphids that are a reddish brown color, almost the color of blood.
[21:01.490 --> 21:04.770]  Aphids come in many different colors.
[21:04.770 --> 21:06.970]  Aphids like to hang out on the bottom sides of your leaves.
[21:06.970 --> 21:10.850]  You guys, they like to congregate at the bottom sides of the leaves, usually kind of where
[21:10.850 --> 21:14.930]  they've got some protection where they can hide from predators and light and you and
[21:14.930 --> 21:15.930]  the wind.
[21:15.930 --> 21:21.730]  I've also seen aphids right where the bud, at the top bud, where it kind of, where the
[21:21.730 --> 21:24.210]  leaves come out of the bud and kind of make like a bowl.
[21:24.490 --> 21:28.210]  The leaves were coming out of the bud and curling up because the bud was really happy.
[21:28.210 --> 21:31.930]  Right in that little chilling area where the leaves and bud made contact, there was a nice
[21:31.930 --> 21:34.530]  little colony of aphids just chilling and living right there.
[21:34.530 --> 21:37.850]  I don't know how long they'd been there, but they were there for a long time because there
[21:37.850 --> 21:40.330]  were a bunch of them.
[21:40.330 --> 21:43.490]  Aphids like to hang out in a lot of different places in the plant.
[21:43.490 --> 21:45.330]  Make sure you check often.
[21:45.330 --> 21:50.930]  They also breed very quickly, so make sure you're paying attention for aphids also.
[21:50.930 --> 21:51.930]  Aphids.
[21:51.930 --> 21:54.330]  The problem with aphids is they are leaf suckers.
[21:54.330 --> 21:58.090]  They like to bite into your leaf and suck out the juices, just like all the other damn
[21:58.090 --> 22:00.010]  pests for your gardens.
[22:00.010 --> 22:03.090]  So they get up under the leaves, they poke little holes in there, they start sucking
[22:03.090 --> 22:05.630]  out the leaf juices and all the life out of your plants.
[22:05.630 --> 22:07.370]  Your plants start looking like shit.
[22:07.370 --> 22:10.890]  Now your plants are getting weak and they're susceptible to other problems.
[22:10.890 --> 22:12.690]  They're also going to yield less.
[22:12.690 --> 22:14.170]  They're going to grow slowly.
[22:14.170 --> 22:15.690]  They're going to look like shit.
[22:15.690 --> 22:19.170]  A lot of times if an aphid problem gets out of control, you'll start seeing the leaves
[22:19.170 --> 22:21.890]  start to curl and wilt and look like they're dead.
[22:21.890 --> 22:22.890]  They're just giving up.
[22:22.890 --> 22:26.090]  Those plants have been beat to shit and they've been chewed up by the aphids so bad that they're
[22:26.090 --> 22:27.490]  not even going to try to fight anymore.
[22:27.490 --> 22:29.490]  They're just going to curl up and die.
[22:29.490 --> 22:30.490]  Try again next year.
[22:30.490 --> 22:35.090]  All right, let's talk about how to prevent yourself from getting aphids in your ganja
[22:35.090 --> 22:36.090]  garden.
[22:36.090 --> 22:40.490]  Like most other pests, we can avoid getting them by having filtration, dust filters, and
[22:40.490 --> 22:44.090]  HEPA filters on your intake and your outgoing vents.
[22:44.090 --> 22:47.690]  Also, you need a clean grow room.
[22:47.690 --> 22:51.930]  I keep talking about a clean grow room, but every leaf, every piece of debris is a place
[22:51.930 --> 22:53.610]  for a bug to hide.
[22:53.610 --> 22:58.690]  So also, something you can really think about for aphids, you need clean clothes and clean
[22:58.690 --> 22:59.690]  shoes.
[22:59.690 --> 23:04.450]  If you go on a hike, if you are around plants outside, if it is warm, please change your
[23:04.450 --> 23:07.930]  clothes before you go into your garden.
[23:07.930 --> 23:10.650]  I worked in a commercial grow.
[23:10.650 --> 23:11.650]  Everything was clean.
[23:11.650 --> 23:15.930]  One of my coworkers talked about taking their dog for a hike.
[23:15.930 --> 23:20.010]  They posted pictures on Instagram all about taking their dog for a hike.
[23:20.010 --> 23:25.890]  They stopped by the grow to say hello and see if we wanted lunch on their way home.
[23:25.890 --> 23:29.050]  Three days later, that garden had aphids.
[23:29.050 --> 23:33.650]  You guys, I don't want to blame that dog for running through a bush, getting in the car,
[23:33.650 --> 23:37.450]  putting aphids on my friend, my friend coming to the grow and putting aphids in my garden,
[23:37.450 --> 23:40.890]  but honestly, you can tell in my heart that that's what I think fucking happened.
[23:40.890 --> 23:44.390]  So please do not go to a grow after you've been out hiking.
[23:44.390 --> 23:47.550]  Do not come to a grow after you've been playing with your dog.
[23:47.550 --> 23:51.150]  I think that pets are huge carriers of garden pests.
[23:51.150 --> 23:52.990]  They're out there running around in everything.
[23:52.990 --> 23:54.390]  They're low to the ground where the bugs are.
[23:54.390 --> 23:55.390]  They're playing in the dirt.
[23:55.390 --> 23:56.390]  They're playing in the bushes.
[23:56.390 --> 23:57.870]  That's where the garden pests are.
[23:57.870 --> 23:59.550]  They're rubbing up against plants.
[23:59.550 --> 24:01.750]  Plants are where plant pests live.
[24:01.750 --> 24:03.490]  They're not going to bring home predatory mites.
[24:03.490 --> 24:05.070]  They're going to bring home spider mites.
[24:05.070 --> 24:06.910]  They're going to bring home thrips and aphids.
[24:06.910 --> 24:12.290]  So please be very careful with your clothing, your shoes, and your pests.
[24:12.290 --> 24:16.930]  Another good way to prevent aphids in your garden is to check for them.
[24:16.930 --> 24:18.730]  I mean, if they're already there, you're going to see them.
[24:18.730 --> 24:22.530]  A way to prevent an infestation is to check for them very frequently.
[24:22.530 --> 24:27.610]  That's the best way to check and prevent any type of pest infestation is to pay attention
[24:27.610 --> 24:29.330]  every day.
[24:29.330 --> 24:33.050]  One sign that you have got an aphid problem is ants.
[24:33.050 --> 24:37.530]  If you have got ants in your grow room, you have probably got aphids also.
[24:37.530 --> 24:40.730]  Ants and aphids often come together in your garden.
[24:40.730 --> 24:43.010]  So if you've got one, you've probably got the other.
[24:43.010 --> 24:44.010]  Ants are easy to get rid of.
[24:44.010 --> 24:45.010]  We'll talk about that in another episode.
[24:45.010 --> 24:46.650]  I'm actually going to write it down right now.
[24:46.650 --> 24:47.650]  All right.
[24:47.650 --> 24:49.050]  I even wrote it down, so that will happen.
[24:49.050 --> 24:50.050]  Okay.
[24:50.050 --> 24:54.650]  Let's talk about ways to eradicate aphids should they show up in your garden.
[24:54.650 --> 24:56.430]  Of course, we talk about this quite frequently.
[24:56.430 --> 25:01.810]  The first step that you can do if you choose to is you can spray products on your garden.
[25:01.810 --> 25:04.290]  There are many things you can spray for aphids.
[25:04.290 --> 25:07.210]  We're going to talk about, of course, the obvious, neem oil.
[25:07.210 --> 25:09.010]  Neem oil will get rid of the aphids.
[25:09.010 --> 25:10.170]  They don't want to be there.
[25:10.610 --> 25:11.610]  It's sticky.
[25:11.610 --> 25:12.610]  It smells like shit.
[25:12.610 --> 25:13.610]  It tastes terrible.
[25:13.610 --> 25:15.090]  The aphids don't want to hang out on that.
[25:15.090 --> 25:18.130]  A couple of applications of neem oil should get rid of your aphids.
[25:18.130 --> 25:23.570]  However, if you're in flower, you do not want to spray neem oil on flowering plants.
[25:23.570 --> 25:27.410]  Keep in mind, I say it all the time, everything you spray on your buds and your leaves is
[25:27.410 --> 25:29.410]  going to end up in your concentrate.
[25:29.410 --> 25:33.170]  If you've got big, fat, swollen buds, they're going to act like a sponge.
[25:33.170 --> 25:36.290]  You're going to spray neem oil on there and it's going to absorb and hang onto a bunch
[25:36.290 --> 25:37.290]  of neem.
[25:37.410 --> 25:40.130]  If you're going to concentrate it, you'll actually see the neem oil float on the top
[25:40.130 --> 25:41.370]  of your hash.
[25:41.370 --> 25:43.530]  You may have to think about what you're going to do.
[25:43.530 --> 25:47.610]  If you're going to make a lot of concentrates, these sprays may not be for you.
[25:47.610 --> 25:52.090]  If you do choose to use sprays, pyrethrum sprays work well to get rid of aphids.
[25:52.090 --> 25:55.210]  I, of course, have been endorsing the Evergreen brand.
[25:55.210 --> 25:56.450]  It's very affordable.
[25:56.450 --> 25:58.210]  There's another brand that's quite expensive.
[25:58.210 --> 26:00.150]  It's the same thing as Evergreen.
[26:00.150 --> 26:01.350]  You can use cinnamon oil.
[26:01.350 --> 26:02.810]  You can use clove oils.
[26:02.810 --> 26:06.570]  You can use a product made by Ed Rosenthal called Zero Tolerance.
[26:06.570 --> 26:09.450]  All of these products will help you to get rid of your aphids.
[26:09.450 --> 26:15.030]  It's up to you to choose how strongly you want to attack these pests and also how harsh
[26:15.030 --> 26:19.290]  of a chemical you want to apply to the plants that you are loving and that you are growing
[26:19.290 --> 26:25.210]  to use as medicine for yourself or other people that you care for.
[26:25.210 --> 26:30.610]  Another method we can use to get rid of our aphids is a beneficial fungus called Buveria
[26:30.610 --> 26:41.210]  bassiana, which is actually sold as a product called Botanagard 22WP, and it's spelled B-O-T-N-I-G-A-R-D,
[26:41.210 --> 26:43.010]  and it's 22WP.
[26:43.010 --> 26:45.570]  It's a little bit expensive, but it will certainly work.
[26:45.570 --> 26:51.090]  This is the beneficial fungus I keep speaking of that can be applied to treat a plethora
[26:51.090 --> 26:52.090]  of garden insects.
[26:52.090 --> 26:56.170]  You guys, you can find it, of course, at rbco-organics.com.
[26:56.170 --> 26:58.770]  I did not realize it would be for sale on that website.
[26:58.770 --> 27:00.450]  I was not looking for it on that website.
[27:00.490 --> 27:03.810]  I did a quick Google search to see where we could purchase it so I could share it with you,
[27:03.810 --> 27:06.410]  and the first place that came up was RBCO Organics.
[27:06.410 --> 27:11.890]  You guys, I'm sure they will not sponsor me because I'm a cannabis podcast, but let them
[27:11.890 --> 27:13.450]  know if you do shop with them.
[27:13.450 --> 27:16.490]  Let them know that you heard about them through the Grow From Your Heart podcast through Ross
[27:16.490 --> 27:17.490]  DeJeff.
[27:17.490 --> 27:20.770]  Now, we've talked about how to get rid of these aphids on your plants if you don't have
[27:20.770 --> 27:21.770]  giant buds.
[27:21.770 --> 27:25.510]  If you are in flower and you've got giant buds, I would never recommend spraying products
[27:25.510 --> 27:26.510]  on there.
[27:26.510 --> 27:30.130]  You don't want to spray something that's going to leave a flavor or possibly cause some sort
[27:30.170 --> 27:34.730]  of long-lasting health effect that we don't even know about for years to come.
[27:34.730 --> 27:37.970]  If you don't want to spray the plants, what's the next option?
[27:37.970 --> 27:40.530]  It is time to bring out the predator bugs.
[27:40.530 --> 27:43.910]  You guys, this is where ladybugs are useful.
[27:43.910 --> 27:46.530]  Ladybugs do love to eat the shit out of aphids.
[27:46.530 --> 27:50.890]  There's actually a really cool picture in Ed Rosenthal's book of a ladybug just devouring
[27:50.890 --> 27:52.170]  an aphid.
[27:52.170 --> 27:53.610]  This is where the ladybugs do come in.
[27:53.610 --> 27:56.410]  Ladybugs are actually useful for getting rid of your aphids.
[27:56.410 --> 27:59.570]  Also, the praying mantis I discredited earlier.
[27:59.570 --> 28:03.650]  He is actually really good at getting rid of aphids.
[28:03.650 --> 28:07.170]  The ladybugs, the praying mantis, those would be the first steps to getting rid of aphids
[28:07.170 --> 28:08.410]  in your cannabis garden.
[28:08.410 --> 28:11.830]  Then you can bring out aphid parasites and aphid predators.
[28:11.830 --> 28:13.290]  There are several available.
[28:13.290 --> 28:17.330]  The Phidias colomani is a well-known aphid parasite.
[28:17.330 --> 28:19.970]  There are several aphid predators available.
[28:19.970 --> 28:22.170]  Some of them prefer certain conditions.
[28:22.170 --> 28:25.330]  If you're going to work with the predators and the parasites, make sure that you've got
[28:25.330 --> 28:30.330]  the proper and appropriate conditions for these insects so that they can thrive and
[28:30.330 --> 28:33.050]  destroy your aphids.
[28:33.050 --> 28:36.650]  Another thing you can do that is completely free and completely organic, it's safe and
[28:36.650 --> 28:41.610]  simple, you can simply remove leaves or you can remove buds that are infested with bugs.
[28:41.610 --> 28:42.610]  It is not a big deal.
[28:42.610 --> 28:47.410]  Chop it off, put it in a trash bag, seal the trash bag, put that in a sealed trash can
[28:47.410 --> 28:53.970]  away from the grow, and you will have manually eliminated the problem from your grow.
[28:53.970 --> 28:56.850]  Another thing I want to mention that I forgot to write down, but I just thought of it as
[28:56.850 --> 29:02.010]  I was talking, oftentimes I have seen aphids on the stems of cannabis plants moving up
[29:02.010 --> 29:04.050]  and down, just traveling around the plant.
[29:04.050 --> 29:08.690]  A product called stylet oil will coat the stems of the plants and it will leave it like
[29:08.690 --> 29:12.370]  an undesirable place for these aphids to be.
[29:12.370 --> 29:17.130]  Check out a product called stylet oil, dilute it heavily, apply it to your plants, and that
[29:17.130 --> 29:23.090]  will keep away most of your garden pests, especially these aphids and also the white
[29:23.090 --> 29:24.090]  flies.
[29:24.090 --> 29:29.330]  All right, cannabis community, I want to thank you for listening to part two of preventing,
[29:29.330 --> 29:32.370]  identifying, and eradicating common garden pests and issues.
[29:32.370 --> 29:36.950]  So far we've only covered insects, but once we cover the majority of the cannabis pest
[29:36.950 --> 29:41.090]  insects, we are going to work our way into identifying other problems in the garden,
[29:41.090 --> 29:43.210]  such as plants that are too dry and too wet.
[29:43.210 --> 29:46.370]  I'll teach you how to identify overfed and underfed plants.
[29:46.370 --> 29:48.890]  We'll talk about calcium and magnesium deficiencies.
[29:48.890 --> 29:50.810]  I've got a lot of things planned for you.
[29:50.810 --> 29:55.290]  I hope you subscribe and stick around for all of those episodes.
[29:55.290 --> 29:58.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of the podcast where I remind you about Patreon.

[30:41.810 --> 30:45.410]  I want to give a big shout out to the people who have contributed to Patreon.
[30:45.410 --> 30:47.250]  Somebody threw down $10 the other day.
[30:47.250 --> 30:50.890]  I'm not sure if they want their name said on the show, but big shout out.
[30:50.890 --> 30:51.890]  It's hugely appreciated.
[30:51.890 --> 30:55.130]  All right, you guys, I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
