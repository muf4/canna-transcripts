[00:16.960 --> 00:19.320]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.320 --> 00:21.120]  It's time for episode number 97
[00:21.120 --> 00:23.080]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.080 --> 00:27.000]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.000 --> 00:28.080]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.080 --> 00:29.240]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.240 --> 00:31.560]  if you're a new smoker or a veteran dabber,
[00:31.560 --> 00:32.760]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.760 --> 00:34.320]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.320 --> 00:35.720]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.600]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.600 --> 00:40.880]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:40.880 --> 00:42.080]  Sitting across the table from me
[00:42.080 --> 00:43.220]  is my good buddy, White Mike.
[00:43.220 --> 00:44.060]  How you doing today, bro?
[00:44.060 --> 00:45.440]  Doing well, man, how are you?
[00:45.440 --> 00:47.500]  I'm doing great, man, thanks for joining me.
[00:47.500 --> 00:48.540]  For those of you guys that don't know,
[00:48.540 --> 00:49.560]  Mike is a good friend of mine.
[00:49.560 --> 00:51.220]  We've been in the cannabis industry,
[00:51.220 --> 00:52.900]  the legal cannabis industry together
[00:52.900 --> 00:54.980]  for close to 10 years now-ish,
[00:54.980 --> 00:56.420]  maybe a little longer than that.
[00:56.420 --> 00:59.160]  Dude, that's the marijuana extended time,
[01:00.340 --> 01:01.680]  closer to seven.
[01:01.680 --> 01:03.540]  Okay, I'll give you that much.
[01:03.540 --> 01:05.460]  I recently had to run the timeline,
[01:05.460 --> 01:08.020]  which is why I know that number a little faster.
[01:08.020 --> 01:08.860]  Okay, I'll believe you.
[01:08.860 --> 01:11.100]  Mike says we've been in this industry together as buddies.
[01:11.100 --> 01:12.300]  It seems like a lot longer.
[01:12.300 --> 01:14.260]  When you're trimming, time kind of stretches.
[01:14.280 --> 01:15.480]  Oh God, it does.
[01:15.480 --> 01:18.040]  And we've trimmed a lot of herb together.
[01:18.040 --> 01:20.080]  You have trimmed a lot of my herb for me.
[01:20.080 --> 01:20.920]  I have.
[01:20.920 --> 01:23.400]  So Mike's a fellow cannabis activist,
[01:23.400 --> 01:24.240]  a good friend of mine,
[01:24.240 --> 01:26.740]  and also a coworker over at the Spot Dispensary.
[01:27.840 --> 01:29.200]  He's shaking his head yes.
[01:29.200 --> 01:30.040]  I am, you can't do that.
[01:30.040 --> 01:30.860]  That is true.
[01:30.860 --> 01:31.700]  That's right, I'm on a podcast.
[01:31.700 --> 01:32.540]  What I said is true.
[01:32.540 --> 01:33.360]  I didn't ask a question or anything,
[01:33.360 --> 01:34.540]  so there was no need for you to respond
[01:34.540 --> 01:36.040]  other than a head shake was appropriate,
[01:36.040 --> 01:37.520]  but it was just funny to watch you shake your head
[01:37.520 --> 01:39.040]  and think that the people might have heard that.
[01:39.040 --> 01:40.880]  Yep, speak the truth, brother.
[01:40.880 --> 01:42.720]  Yeah, so he's a coworker over there.
[01:43.560 --> 01:45.980]  We're gonna talk about that in just a second.
[01:45.980 --> 01:47.220]  Actually, here, let's just go for it.
[01:47.220 --> 01:48.540]  Today over at the Spot Dispensary, man,
[01:48.540 --> 01:50.620]  we had a great moment.
[01:50.620 --> 01:53.780]  We actually had the fire inspector come in.
[01:53.780 --> 01:55.300]  Yeah, this was a big moment.
[01:55.300 --> 01:58.340]  That's one of the last sign-offs we've been waiting on.
[01:58.340 --> 01:59.820]  It was something I was gonna, before I get too far,
[01:59.820 --> 02:01.700]  follow Mike on Twitter.
[02:01.700 --> 02:03.900]  It's Nemopunk15.
[02:03.900 --> 02:06.460]  Make sure you follow him there on the Twitter, Nemopunk15.
[02:06.460 --> 02:07.500]  He's a cannabis activist.
[02:07.500 --> 02:10.140]  He posts a lot of good news-related articles.
[02:10.140 --> 02:11.820]  He posts a lot of great topics.
[02:11.840 --> 02:13.800]  That way you can be following him, checking out his feed,
[02:13.800 --> 02:15.720]  stalking him while you're listening to the show.
[02:15.720 --> 02:17.200]  It's always fun to know who you're checking out.
[02:17.200 --> 02:19.760]  Yep, follow me and then shoot me a message or a tweet
[02:19.760 --> 02:21.880]  and let me know you're following from the podcast.
[02:21.880 --> 02:22.720]  Yeah, tweet at him.
[02:22.720 --> 02:23.540]  He likes that shit.
[02:23.540 --> 02:24.380]  Yes, I do.
[02:24.380 --> 02:26.280]  So today at the Spot Dispensary,
[02:26.280 --> 02:28.560]  the fire inspector,
[02:28.560 --> 02:31.500]  the Pueblo West Metro fire inspector showed up,
[02:31.500 --> 02:33.460]  and we've got these big windows.
[02:33.460 --> 02:35.500]  He did a fire inspection, and of course we passed.
[02:35.500 --> 02:36.440]  I'm gonna jump right to that.
[02:36.440 --> 02:37.280]  We fucking passed.
[02:37.280 --> 02:40.120]  I'm not even gonna do any hesitation to that one.
[02:40.120 --> 02:41.520]  We passed with flying colors.
[02:42.220 --> 02:43.060]  But here's the great part.
[02:43.060 --> 02:44.420]  We've got these big sliding doors
[02:44.420 --> 02:46.180]  that go over some windows.
[02:46.180 --> 02:49.140]  Our facility is set up to be a touring facility.
[02:49.140 --> 02:53.200]  So we put giant glass windows between the tour area
[02:53.200 --> 02:54.380]  and where the plants will be
[02:54.380 --> 02:57.160]  so that the plants will not become contaminated
[02:57.160 --> 03:00.500]  by anything that our touring people will come in with.
[03:00.500 --> 03:02.500]  And also they won't be able to touch the plants,
[03:02.500 --> 03:05.740]  so it keeps us completely compliant and legal.
[03:05.740 --> 03:08.500]  So we've designed the facility to be tour prepared.
[03:08.500 --> 03:10.600]  So we've got these big, giant windows.
[03:10.620 --> 03:12.660]  Would you say they're 12 feet tall, Mike?
[03:12.660 --> 03:14.300]  Easy, easy 12.
[03:14.300 --> 03:16.180]  All right, so these are big, eight by 12.
[03:16.180 --> 03:17.020]  I'm just guessing.
[03:17.020 --> 03:20.220]  They're about eight feet wide by about 12 feet tall.
[03:20.220 --> 03:23.500]  Big ass panes of glass with gigantic,
[03:23.500 --> 03:24.980]  they're garage doors,
[03:24.980 --> 03:27.300]  but calling them garage doors downplays them.
[03:27.300 --> 03:31.460]  Yeah, it's a good description, but I can't do better.
[03:31.460 --> 03:34.780]  But yeah, it underplays significantly what we've got here.
[03:34.780 --> 03:37.120]  They're garage doors made by Kodak,
[03:37.120 --> 03:40.340]  and they are used in the darkroom film developing industry
[03:41.080 --> 03:42.200]  and the professional film developing industry
[03:42.200 --> 03:44.240]  is what I was told these doors are for.
[03:44.240 --> 03:45.880]  So we've got these grow rooms,
[03:45.880 --> 03:48.300]  and of course in the night cycle in the grow rooms,
[03:48.300 --> 03:50.560]  we need 100% darkness,
[03:50.560 --> 03:53.560]  and we need to have that whenever the timer requires that.
[03:53.560 --> 03:56.640]  So these doors, garage style doors,
[03:56.640 --> 03:59.840]  roll up and down on a little button,
[03:59.840 --> 04:01.000]  and it keeps the light out.
[04:01.000 --> 04:03.520]  And it also, maybe we're doing something in there
[04:03.520 --> 04:04.800]  that we don't want you to watch.
[04:04.800 --> 04:06.440]  So maybe we can close it down for privacy
[04:06.440 --> 04:07.520]  so the workers can work in there
[04:07.520 --> 04:09.720]  without the tourist seeing that little area.
[04:10.440 --> 04:12.040]  So the fire inspector came,
[04:12.040 --> 04:14.340]  and a big part of those doors is their fire safety.
[04:14.340 --> 04:17.240]  If there happens to be a fire in that grow room,
[04:17.240 --> 04:19.680]  those doors will pop down, the smoke alarm will go off,
[04:19.680 --> 04:21.920]  but when the smoke alarm triggers a drop
[04:21.920 --> 04:24.440]  and those doors all drop at one time,
[04:24.440 --> 04:27.120]  and then the fire hopefully is contained to that small area
[04:27.120 --> 04:28.220]  and we can put it out.
[04:30.100 --> 04:31.880]  The fire inspector was walking around,
[04:31.880 --> 04:33.760]  he had his arms crossed, trying to be tough,
[04:33.760 --> 04:34.600]  you know what I mean?
[04:34.600 --> 04:36.280]  Like the fire inspector has to be a brute.
[04:36.280 --> 04:37.120]  He can't be a pussy.
[04:37.120 --> 04:40.040]  He has to hold his ground and be a stern dude, right?
[04:40.740 --> 04:41.660]  And you can see the look on his face,
[04:41.660 --> 04:43.860]  like, wow, this is kind of a nice facility.
[04:43.860 --> 04:45.460]  He was like checking it out,
[04:45.460 --> 04:46.780]  but he was trying to not show it,
[04:46.780 --> 04:49.540]  holding this clip, boarding his pen like a tough guy.
[04:49.540 --> 04:51.700]  And then he goes, what I need to see is I want you
[04:51.700 --> 04:54.060]  to trip one of these fire alarms right here.
[04:54.060 --> 04:55.140]  He just picked one randomly,
[04:55.140 --> 04:57.840]  and he goes, and I need all of these doors to fall.
[04:57.840 --> 04:59.860]  And we looked at each other like, they're gonna fall.
[04:59.860 --> 05:01.220]  We tested them all day yesterday.
[05:01.220 --> 05:02.260]  We like fine-tuned this shit.
[05:02.260 --> 05:03.460]  We know it's gonna work.
[05:03.460 --> 05:04.940]  He pushes the button and it goes beep,
[05:04.940 --> 05:08.260]  and all the doors came down beautifully in unison.
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.120]  It sounds like a train starting up when they go down,
[05:11.120 --> 05:12.920]  because there's like 15 of these doors
[05:12.920 --> 05:15.760]  that weigh 300 pounds each coming down on a track.
[05:15.760 --> 05:17.400]  And they just all perfectly in unison.
[05:17.400 --> 05:18.240]  And when they hit the floor,
[05:18.240 --> 05:19.920]  there's a little trigger that stops them
[05:19.920 --> 05:22.240]  and like a hydraulic that makes them just,
[05:22.240 --> 05:23.560]  and they stop.
[05:23.560 --> 05:25.680]  And he uncrossed his arms and looked around
[05:25.680 --> 05:27.000]  and he goes, I'm impressed.
[05:27.000 --> 05:28.440]  I'm gonna sign off.
[05:28.440 --> 05:31.020]  Like we went and signed our little fire paper thing.
[05:31.020 --> 05:33.280]  So it was so great to hear him.
[05:33.280 --> 05:34.920]  When you impress the fire inspector,
[05:34.920 --> 05:35.920]  you're doing something right.
[05:35.940 --> 05:37.740]  A lot of people have worked really hard
[05:37.740 --> 05:39.380]  to get that piece of paper signed.
[05:39.380 --> 05:40.420]  That's absolutely true.
[05:40.420 --> 05:41.260]  Shout out to Sam.
[05:41.260 --> 05:43.300]  Sam was a big help that day.
[05:43.300 --> 05:46.460]  The Department of Agriculture told us they were impressed
[05:46.460 --> 05:48.900]  because we are doing what other people said
[05:48.900 --> 05:50.860]  is not possible for a growth facility.
[05:50.860 --> 05:52.300]  Other people can't seem to catch on
[05:52.300 --> 05:55.420]  and figure out how to do what Robert has done in that place.
[05:55.420 --> 05:56.900]  So shout out to the spot.
[05:56.900 --> 05:58.460]  You guys are doing it right.
[05:58.460 --> 06:00.260]  People keep asking me how long.
[06:00.260 --> 06:01.300]  It's getting close, you guys.
[06:01.300 --> 06:02.680]  It's getting close.
[06:02.680 --> 06:04.020]  Make sure you drop in the spot dispenser
[06:04.040 --> 06:06.200]  if you're ever in Pueblo or Pueblo West, Colorado.
[06:06.200 --> 06:07.360]  This is not a spot commercial.
[06:07.360 --> 06:08.840]  I just wanted to talk about some exciting shit
[06:08.840 --> 06:09.680]  that happened.
[06:09.680 --> 06:13.000]  I, of course, am the lead grower at the spot dispensary
[06:13.000 --> 06:15.240]  and what happens all day keeps me excited.
[06:15.240 --> 06:16.680]  We get to do some fun shit.
[06:16.680 --> 06:18.680]  It's a lot of fun at work.
[06:18.680 --> 06:19.920]  I remember hearing people say,
[06:19.920 --> 06:21.320]  if you do something you love,
[06:21.320 --> 06:23.120]  it doesn't feel like work all day.
[06:23.120 --> 06:23.960]  Right.
[06:23.960 --> 06:25.200]  There's a lot of shit about my job
[06:25.200 --> 06:26.400]  that fucking feels like work all day.
[06:26.400 --> 06:28.000]  I'm not saying it doesn't,
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.560]  but there's a lot of really fun shit that happened too.
[06:31.580 --> 06:34.420]  I've got some 90% THC hash in my oval right now.
[06:34.420 --> 06:37.940]  It was only in the shop for nine hours.
[06:37.940 --> 06:39.520]  Was all that was on the shelf.
[06:40.460 --> 06:42.980]  Basically, the first 15 people to find out we had it
[06:42.980 --> 06:43.820]  bought it.
[06:43.820 --> 06:45.300]  Yeah, I would have bought it had I known it was there.
[06:45.300 --> 06:47.740]  I don't even buy dispensary hash very often.
[06:47.740 --> 06:50.540]  Two employees weren't at work and said,
[06:50.540 --> 06:52.420]  put one in the safe for me.
[06:52.420 --> 06:55.220]  Managers didn't get a shot at it and bought shit.
[06:55.220 --> 06:56.060]  Employee.
[06:56.060 --> 06:56.900]  Under employees.
[06:56.900 --> 06:57.740]  Yeah.
[06:57.740 --> 06:58.580]  That's the benefits to being the manager.
[06:58.580 --> 07:00.380]  First come, first served, deal with it.
[07:01.200 --> 07:03.280]  But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of perks like that.
[07:03.280 --> 07:05.400]  Just roll through randomly.
[07:05.400 --> 07:06.400]  Well, that's, I didn't,
[07:06.400 --> 07:08.240]  this wasn't a topic planned for the show or anything,
[07:08.240 --> 07:09.440]  but let's talk about this a little bit.
[07:09.440 --> 07:10.880]  I'm going to fix this compressor here.
[07:10.880 --> 07:12.560]  I did turn up your mic a touch, but here we go.
[07:12.560 --> 07:14.000]  Make this shit all work.
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.960]  Let's talk about how people are always coming in
[07:15.960 --> 07:18.600]  and dropping off applications to the dispensary.
[07:18.600 --> 07:21.720]  And I get a lot of emails on the IRI Genetics,
[07:21.720 --> 07:25.240]  Facebook website, whatever, my own personal Facebook,
[07:25.240 --> 07:27.840]  the Grow From Your Heart, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,
[07:27.840 --> 07:28.680]  whatever.
[07:28.700 --> 07:30.260]  People are always asking,
[07:31.860 --> 07:32.700]  how do they,
[07:32.700 --> 07:34.080]  they're always talking about how they want to work
[07:34.080 --> 07:36.540]  at a dispensary because they want to play with weed all day.
[07:36.540 --> 07:38.400]  And it must be fun to play with weed.
[07:39.620 --> 07:42.160]  As weed, how long have you been a bud tender this time?
[07:42.160 --> 07:43.540]  I know you were a bud tender for a little while
[07:43.540 --> 07:45.140]  when we had the other dispensary, but now.
[07:45.140 --> 07:46.980]  Going on about five months now.
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.040]  Five months now.
[07:49.060 --> 07:52.840]  Has weed just basically become a product
[07:52.840 --> 07:55.780]  or is it something that's fluffy and still amazing
[07:55.780 --> 07:57.780]  and unicorn shit still?
[07:57.800 --> 08:00.000]  It's still unicorn-y.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.840]  Today we got it at a new edible option
[08:02.840 --> 08:05.440]  that I've had in the back of my mind,
[08:05.440 --> 08:07.720]  like when I see one, grab one.
[08:07.720 --> 08:11.600]  And it's been seven years now and I ain't fucking seen one.
[08:11.600 --> 08:14.080]  And they showed up today in my own store.
[08:14.080 --> 08:16.760]  And yeah, I have one sitting in my bag right now
[08:16.760 --> 08:18.200]  that's gonna get devoured here shortly.
[08:18.200 --> 08:19.400]  Oh, I saw that edible.
[08:21.160 --> 08:22.000]  Yeah.
[08:22.000 --> 08:24.640]  So it's still like, you still have a unicorn
[08:24.640 --> 08:25.880]  to chase every day you go to work?
[08:25.900 --> 08:28.180]  At least once a week, something comes through
[08:28.180 --> 08:30.860]  that getting it in, checking it out,
[08:30.860 --> 08:33.020]  getting to tell other people about it all day
[08:33.020 --> 08:34.580]  just blows my mind awesome.
[08:34.580 --> 08:36.300]  Now how much, what percentage of your day,
[08:36.300 --> 08:37.540]  and I'm going somewhere with this.
[08:37.540 --> 08:38.380]  I'm kind of baiting you.
[08:38.380 --> 08:41.220]  What percentage of your day is that unicorn chase?
[08:41.220 --> 08:43.540]  I'm just titled it the unicorn chase at work.
[08:44.940 --> 08:46.380]  I don't know, 5%.
[08:46.380 --> 08:47.260]  Yeah, okay.
[08:47.260 --> 08:50.660]  And the other 95% is fucking work, right?
[08:50.660 --> 08:51.660]  Not quite.
[08:51.660 --> 08:52.620]  Like.
[08:52.620 --> 08:53.460]  Yeah, okay.
[08:53.920 --> 08:56.000]  We're gonna, for example, like rolling,
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.360]  doing our pre-roll joints, we do like a pound worth
[09:00.360 --> 09:04.200]  at a time, so that's 450 joints and change.
[09:04.200 --> 09:07.560]  And it takes days to go from this is what we're gonna
[09:07.560 --> 09:11.400]  pre-roll to here's what we have on our pre-roll selection.
[09:11.400 --> 09:15.360]  And the entire time it's in the corner of the sales floor.
[09:15.360 --> 09:16.960]  So we have customers all day going,
[09:16.960 --> 09:19.040]  oh dude, that looks like the best job ever.
[09:19.040 --> 09:21.280]  And it's not at all the best job ever.
[09:21.280 --> 09:23.120]  It would be if you could smoke one of them
[09:23.780 --> 09:24.740]  the whole time you were rolling.
[09:24.740 --> 09:26.060]  Then it wouldn't be so terrible.
[09:26.060 --> 09:28.740]  But just sit there and roll joint after joint
[09:28.740 --> 09:31.020]  after joint after joint after joint
[09:31.020 --> 09:32.300]  without being able to smoke it.
[09:32.300 --> 09:34.140]  Your hands get sticky, you can't touch your face.
[09:34.140 --> 09:37.500]  Like it's easily the hardest grind at work right now.
[09:37.500 --> 09:39.500]  Trimming's gonna equal that easily or more.
[09:39.500 --> 09:40.820]  Trimming will be a bitch.
[09:40.820 --> 09:41.660]  Yep.
[09:41.660 --> 09:42.820]  So that's where I was headed with this, you guys.
[09:42.820 --> 09:44.600]  Everybody wants to come work at the dispensary,
[09:44.600 --> 09:46.540]  but keep in mind, after you turn in your application,
[09:46.540 --> 09:49.220]  if we do hire you, there will be a lot of tedious work.
[09:49.220 --> 09:50.100]  There's so much work.
[09:50.100 --> 09:52.900]  Like we had a bunch of people come in and apply today
[09:53.680 --> 09:57.840]  and two of them came well-dressed, clean, appropriate,
[09:57.840 --> 09:59.960]  turned in resumes, spoke eloquently,
[09:59.960 --> 10:03.480]  and will get called back for an interview.
[10:03.480 --> 10:05.880]  The guy that showed up with lunch all over his shirt
[10:05.880 --> 10:08.680]  at nine o'clock at night and was like half sloppy drunk,
[10:08.680 --> 10:11.560]  like I wanna work here, give me the info.
[10:11.560 --> 10:12.400]  He ain't gonna work here.
[10:12.400 --> 10:13.880]  No, he is not.
[10:13.880 --> 10:15.320]  He is not gonna work there.
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.160]  Oh man.
[10:16.160 --> 10:18.280]  He's not getting a call back.
[10:18.280 --> 10:19.880]  Yeah, we get dozens of people a day
[10:19.880 --> 10:21.880]  and honestly, we're gonna be hiring a lot of people
[10:21.900 --> 10:22.720]  in the next year or so.
[10:22.720 --> 10:24.540]  Everybody in Colorado is expanding.
[10:24.540 --> 10:25.380]  Everybody.
[10:25.380 --> 10:27.720]  Like the industry's doubling this year.
[10:27.720 --> 10:30.340]  It's gonna double again next year,
[10:30.340 --> 10:32.820]  especially if other states don't get to legalize
[10:32.820 --> 10:34.860]  in 2015 and 2016.
[10:34.860 --> 10:36.500]  If it's only one more state,
[10:36.500 --> 10:39.000]  the industry's gonna triple at least
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.660]  in the next two or three years.
[10:40.660 --> 10:41.500]  Yeah, it's getting crowded here.
[10:41.500 --> 10:43.500]  And that means three times the employees.
[10:44.340 --> 10:46.380]  And the spot has, I think I counted 20,
[10:46.380 --> 10:47.860]  there's about 20 employees.
[10:47.860 --> 10:49.220]  There were a couple that didn't come to the meeting
[10:49.220 --> 10:50.060]  the other day.
[10:50.060 --> 10:52.080]  There's about 20 of us full-time employed there right now.
[10:52.080 --> 10:54.120]  Yep, and we're short-staffed.
[10:54.120 --> 10:55.520]  Yeah, we could definitely use a couple people.
[10:55.520 --> 10:57.680]  So turn in your resume at the spot.
[10:57.680 --> 10:58.840]  Yep, get your badge.
[10:58.840 --> 10:59.920]  Yeah, go get your badge.
[10:59.920 --> 11:01.400]  That's the first thing you gotta do, you guys.
[11:01.400 --> 11:04.080]  Go get your badge and then come apply at the spot.
[11:04.080 --> 11:05.560]  But if you do, once you do get the job there,
[11:05.560 --> 11:06.640]  be prepared to do some work.
[11:06.640 --> 11:08.920]  It's not gonna just be playing with weed.
[11:08.920 --> 11:10.960]  And that was another thing I wanted to mention.
[11:10.960 --> 11:11.960]  Somebody was talking about,
[11:11.960 --> 11:14.600]  well, you guys are just hanging out smoking dope all day.
[11:15.560 --> 11:16.400]  No.
[11:16.400 --> 11:18.320]  We can't even smoke tobacco on the property
[11:18.340 --> 11:20.860]  because it might look like marijuana on the cameras
[11:20.860 --> 11:23.020]  and we don't need that mess with the regulators.
[11:23.020 --> 11:25.060]  Yes, we have to be,
[11:25.060 --> 11:27.480]  I think the rule is 1,000 feet from the premises
[11:27.480 --> 11:30.500]  before anybody is allowed to smoke near any dispensary
[11:30.500 --> 11:32.560]  is actually what I think the technical rule is.
[11:32.560 --> 11:34.460]  It may not be true, but that's why.
[11:34.460 --> 11:35.820]  I don't know if there's a,
[11:35.820 --> 11:37.460]  like you can't smoke in public
[11:37.460 --> 11:39.700]  in like parking lots that are in public.
[11:39.700 --> 11:40.540]  Okay.
[11:40.540 --> 11:42.660]  And as far as on the dispensary premise goes,
[11:42.660 --> 11:44.620]  we're specifically barred from having
[11:44.620 --> 11:47.300]  any sort of consumption allowed on our property
[11:47.320 --> 11:48.640]  by state regulation.
[11:48.640 --> 11:50.520]  And that includes all employees.
[11:50.520 --> 11:51.360]  Yep.
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.240]  And there's been a number of dispensaries
[11:53.240 --> 11:56.080]  that have been fined because employees had
[11:56.080 --> 11:59.040]  like vape cartridge pens in their purses and stuff.
[11:59.040 --> 12:00.160]  We're not supposed to have,
[12:00.160 --> 12:02.520]  I can't have my rig in my car.
[12:02.520 --> 12:03.340]  Nope.
[12:03.340 --> 12:04.280]  While I'm on the clock,
[12:04.280 --> 12:07.200]  if my car is in the parking lot at the dispensary,
[12:07.200 --> 12:08.080]  sorry guys, I'm burping.
[12:08.080 --> 12:09.200]  I just opened up a fresh drink
[12:09.200 --> 12:11.040]  and I'm burping it up while I'm recording here.
[12:11.040 --> 12:13.440]  While I'm in on the clock at the dispensary working,
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.100]  I can't have my fresh, shiny green Toro rig
[12:17.900 --> 12:19.280]  in my case, in my backpack, in the car,
[12:19.280 --> 12:20.340]  so that when I get off work,
[12:20.340 --> 12:22.880]  I can drive over to Mike's house and dab him out.
[12:22.880 --> 12:24.400]  I can't have it there.
[12:24.400 --> 12:27.320]  Or if I'm going to a concert or a comedy show after work,
[12:27.320 --> 12:28.600]  I can't have my rig in my car.
[12:28.600 --> 12:32.040]  So I have to, I'm a medical marijuana patient
[12:32.040 --> 12:34.160]  and sometimes my back hurts.
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.160]  Sometimes I will have to, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:39.840 --> 12:42.100]  If I choose to, if I choose that I need to medicate
[12:42.100 --> 12:44.740]  during working hours, I have to drive home
[12:44.760 --> 12:46.880]  and take a dab, eat lunch,
[12:46.880 --> 12:48.800]  and then drive all the way back to work
[12:48.800 --> 12:51.600]  because I can't bring my damn backpack and dab rig to work.
[12:51.600 --> 12:54.040]  Mike's shaking his head no, like you shouldn't say that.
[12:54.040 --> 12:55.400]  But people have seen my periscope.
[12:55.400 --> 12:57.000]  They know that once in a while I've dabbed
[12:57.000 --> 12:57.840]  on my lunch break.
[12:57.840 --> 12:58.660]  Fair point.
[12:58.660 --> 12:59.760]  Yeah, and by the time I get back to work,
[12:59.760 --> 13:01.320]  it's like a fucking 30 minute drive back
[13:01.320 --> 13:03.800]  to the middle of the desert.
[13:03.800 --> 13:05.160]  Right, it is a little annoying.
[13:05.160 --> 13:06.960]  I have to leave town every day for work,
[13:06.960 --> 13:07.800]  but I don't really care.
[13:07.800 --> 13:08.800]  I've commuted much further.
[13:08.800 --> 13:09.640]  No, that's cool.
[13:09.640 --> 13:10.460]  I don't.
[13:10.460 --> 13:11.300]  Much more shitty jobs.
[13:11.300 --> 13:12.640]  It's a good drive to put on some music
[13:12.660 --> 13:15.140]  and just jam out because it's a fast drive.
[13:15.140 --> 13:17.560]  It's mostly highway miles, so it's legit.
[13:17.560 --> 13:20.260]  All right, let's put this show back on the damn road.
[13:20.260 --> 13:21.420]  No, we're not allowed to smoke at work.
[13:21.420 --> 13:24.540]  We're not allowed to medicate anywhere near the building.
[13:24.540 --> 13:26.980]  If you think about it, it's when you go
[13:26.980 --> 13:30.060]  to the liquor store, like is the clerk drunk?
[13:30.060 --> 13:32.620]  Like when you go to the Gap, like fair point,
[13:32.620 --> 13:34.460]  the kid's probably dressed in all Gap,
[13:34.460 --> 13:37.860]  but like we go so far with it at work
[13:37.860 --> 13:40.100]  that there's a special protocol for employees buying.
[13:40.100 --> 13:41.460]  We buy stuff all day.
[13:41.960 --> 13:44.080]  Every day there's at least two employees
[13:44.080 --> 13:45.960]  that worked that day buying something,
[13:45.960 --> 13:47.760]  but we've got special protocol for it
[13:47.760 --> 13:50.600]  because if it's just like in my car,
[13:50.600 --> 13:52.640]  we can get in a lot of trouble for it.
[13:52.640 --> 13:53.480]  Oh yeah.
[13:53.480 --> 13:54.320]  Like even if it's a sealed exit bag.
[13:54.320 --> 13:57.300]  So what happens if you go in and you buy that diesel hatch,
[13:57.300 --> 13:58.400]  what do you have to do with it?
[13:58.400 --> 14:01.760]  It goes in the safe until the end of the shift
[14:01.760 --> 14:03.240]  and then right at the end of the night,
[14:03.240 --> 14:04.680]  as for we lock the front door,
[14:04.680 --> 14:08.360]  it's employees want anybody buying anything
[14:08.360 --> 14:10.560]  and then we all queue up just like custies.
[14:11.100 --> 14:12.580]  Okay. Right at the end of the night.
[14:12.580 --> 14:13.940]  Yep.
[14:13.940 --> 14:16.180]  And then it all gets sealed in an exit bag
[14:16.180 --> 14:17.020]  like it does for everyone.
[14:17.020 --> 14:19.580]  Just like we can't throw it in a backpack or nothing.
[14:19.580 --> 14:20.660]  Like, oh wow.
[14:20.660 --> 14:21.500]  Yeah.
[14:21.500 --> 14:22.980]  Cause it's all, it's all official
[14:22.980 --> 14:25.260]  so that there's no question about us using it.
[14:25.260 --> 14:26.900]  They've told me not to even bring my backpack.
[14:26.900 --> 14:28.100]  They're like, once in a while,
[14:28.100 --> 14:29.580]  I'm going to have to bring clothes and stuff.
[14:29.580 --> 14:30.700]  Cause I work in the back.
[14:30.700 --> 14:33.060]  I'm required by the department of agriculture
[14:33.060 --> 14:35.420]  to have a change of at least one change of clothes,
[14:35.420 --> 14:37.220]  like all the way down to the underwear and socks
[14:37.220 --> 14:40.760]  in the locker accessible because I'm handling pesticides
[14:40.760 --> 14:41.840]  and other chemicals and things.
[14:41.840 --> 14:44.140]  So I need, I'm required to have a change of clothes,
[14:44.140 --> 14:46.960]  but they're like, bring as little backpack and stuff
[14:46.960 --> 14:47.960]  as you need to bring here.
[14:47.960 --> 14:49.520]  They don't, we don't want backpacks
[14:49.520 --> 14:50.800]  and shit coming into the building.
[14:50.800 --> 14:53.680]  We don't need it on camera, especially going to the back.
[14:53.680 --> 14:56.060]  They're like, please just don't like, yeah.
[14:56.060 --> 14:58.880]  So I pretty much take what I need for work.
[14:58.880 --> 14:59.920]  Do they haven't said anything about mine
[14:59.920 --> 15:02.040]  because it never leaves the security desk.
[15:02.040 --> 15:02.880]  Right. Yeah.
[15:02.880 --> 15:04.980]  I come in and it gets set on the counter
[15:04.980 --> 15:06.880]  and it comes off the counter again when I leave.
[15:07.540 --> 15:09.260]  And I go into the back and it's like a labyrinth back there.
[15:09.260 --> 15:10.660]  There's all kinds of nooks and crannies
[15:10.660 --> 15:11.740]  and there wouldn't be anywhere really
[15:11.740 --> 15:13.020]  to put my backpack anyway.
[15:13.020 --> 15:15.280]  So your locker, it wouldn't fit.
[15:15.280 --> 15:17.140]  The lockers are only the lockers are teeny.
[15:17.140 --> 15:19.380]  We got the lockers back there since the lockers came in.
[15:19.380 --> 15:20.500]  Yeah. They're purse size.
[15:20.500 --> 15:22.940]  So if you got a purse, yeah, that's what they're for.
[15:22.940 --> 15:24.300]  Right. We're kind of way off topic here.
[15:24.300 --> 15:25.820]  You guys, I don't even know what the hell
[15:25.820 --> 15:26.740]  we're talking about anymore.
[15:26.740 --> 15:27.580]  It's good. I like it.
[15:27.580 --> 15:28.400]  It's good.
[15:28.400 --> 15:29.420]  Some, it was a really good week.
[15:29.420 --> 15:32.460]  People that are not from Colorado kind of like to hear our,
[15:32.460 --> 15:34.500]  our how our lives are and what's going on.
[15:34.500 --> 15:35.620]  And since we're two dudes at work,
[15:36.440 --> 15:38.120]  that's one of the fun part, dude.
[15:38.120 --> 15:41.080]  People come in every day and are just blown the fuck away
[15:41.080 --> 15:43.880]  about how regular it is.
[15:43.880 --> 15:47.520]  How many, so I heard another person ask this
[15:47.520 --> 15:48.560]  and I thought it would be interesting.
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.280]  And I was going to talk about it in a future episode,
[15:50.280 --> 15:53.440]  but since you're here, what's the breakdown of people,
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.960]  where they're from?
[15:54.960 --> 15:57.140]  Like how many people are Colorado folk?
[15:57.140 --> 15:58.440]  How many people are from out of state?
[15:58.440 --> 16:01.000]  And is there, am I talking shit when I say
[16:01.000 --> 16:03.120]  that probably 50% of the people that come in
[16:03.120 --> 16:04.000]  are from Texas?
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.480]  Is that true?
[16:06.340 --> 16:07.180]  Yeah, fully.
[16:07.180 --> 16:08.700]  Especially if we do a breakdown over the,
[16:08.700 --> 16:11.460]  if we're talking about like a year range,
[16:11.460 --> 16:13.220]  easily half the people that come through
[16:13.220 --> 16:15.940]  most recreational dispensaries are tourists.
[16:15.940 --> 16:17.260]  That's statewide.
[16:17.260 --> 16:18.100]  All right.
[16:18.100 --> 16:20.060]  In places like Aspen, it's like 80 or 90%.
[16:20.060 --> 16:20.900]  Wow.
[16:20.900 --> 16:23.340]  Marijuana is crazy expensive up there.
[16:23.340 --> 16:25.300]  We get people from Aspen in our shop.
[16:26.260 --> 16:29.460]  It's crazy expensive in Aspen and they're down in Pueblo
[16:29.460 --> 16:30.980]  because they were driving through the area
[16:30.980 --> 16:33.380]  and weed maps told them to stop here.
[16:33.380 --> 16:34.220]  Go to the spot.
[16:34.240 --> 16:36.040]  Yep, and they get loaded up before they head back
[16:36.040 --> 16:38.600]  to their city in Colorado where it's way more expensive
[16:38.600 --> 16:39.440]  than touristy.
[16:39.440 --> 16:40.960]  Nice.
[16:40.960 --> 16:42.800]  But easily half the people that roll through
[16:42.800 --> 16:43.840]  are from Texas.
[16:43.840 --> 16:46.000]  And it comes in bizarre ways.
[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Like on one day, everybody will be from Alabama.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.160]  The next day, everybody will be from Tennessee.
[16:50.160 --> 16:52.440]  Yesterday it was Missouri and truckers.
[16:52.440 --> 16:54.600]  We actually have a bus load.
[16:54.600 --> 16:55.700]  I don't know how they actually travel.
[16:55.700 --> 16:56.540]  There are 10 of them.
[16:56.540 --> 16:59.560]  They come from Kansas and they all come together.
[16:59.560 --> 17:02.880]  And they always show up, they come about once a month.
[17:02.880 --> 17:04.120]  There are 10 of them that show up.
[17:04.980 --> 17:05.820]  It's like a field trip.
[17:05.820 --> 17:06.640]  It's kind of neat.
[17:06.640 --> 17:08.300]  It happens way more often than you'd think.
[17:08.300 --> 17:10.260]  Like families come through today.
[17:10.260 --> 17:12.060]  There was a girl with her grandmother
[17:12.060 --> 17:14.900]  and her grandmother just had a filthy mouth.
[17:14.900 --> 17:17.420]  Dirty joke after dirty joke.
[17:17.420 --> 17:19.340]  And the granddaughter was mortified
[17:19.340 --> 17:20.980]  and they're buying weed together.
[17:22.020 --> 17:23.340]  We get shit like that constantly.
[17:23.340 --> 17:24.340]  That's kind of neat.
[17:24.340 --> 17:25.180]  Yep.
[17:25.180 --> 17:26.820]  Grandma and granddaughter buying her together.
[17:26.820 --> 17:29.780]  And they're all blown away because we have marijuana stores
[17:29.780 --> 17:32.300]  where you can walk in and just like every other store,
[17:32.320 --> 17:34.920]  there's a salesperson there to tell you all about it.
[17:34.920 --> 17:38.480]  The biggest obstacle to the shop is the security guard.
[17:38.480 --> 17:40.840]  You have to have an ID that says you're 21.
[17:40.840 --> 17:42.640]  And if you got that, go on in and buy some.
[17:42.640 --> 17:43.760]  He goes, it'll be a second.
[17:43.760 --> 17:45.280]  And he makes sure that there's somebody back there
[17:45.280 --> 17:46.720]  and he goes, go on back.
[17:46.720 --> 17:48.280]  And he can go buy weed.
[17:48.280 --> 17:49.120]  Yeah.
[17:49.120 --> 17:50.400]  And people don't know what to think sometimes.
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.280]  I don't get to spend a lot of time up front
[17:52.280 --> 17:53.640]  because I'm supposed to be in the back
[17:53.640 --> 17:55.140]  in the cave growing the weed.
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.960]  But sometimes I got to venture up to the front.
[17:56.960 --> 17:57.800]  I got questions.
[17:57.800 --> 17:59.960]  I got to go find a boss and they're hard to find.
[17:59.960 --> 18:01.800]  So I just find myself in the bedroom watching
[18:02.300 --> 18:03.280]  and seeing what's going on.
[18:03.280 --> 18:05.380]  And a good portion of the people that I meet
[18:05.380 --> 18:06.460]  are from out of state.
[18:06.460 --> 18:08.420]  And they all see the little board with the pins in it.
[18:08.420 --> 18:09.620]  And they're like, what's this?
[18:09.620 --> 18:11.180]  And I know I just gave everybody in America
[18:11.180 --> 18:13.340]  like a weird shitty Southern accent.
[18:13.340 --> 18:14.780]  But I'm like, that's our little map to mark
[18:14.780 --> 18:15.620]  where everybody's from.
[18:15.620 --> 18:17.260]  If your spot doesn't have a pin,
[18:17.260 --> 18:19.060]  if your city doesn't have a pin, put a pin in there.
[18:19.060 --> 18:20.060]  And they're like, all right.
[18:20.060 --> 18:21.980]  And I see everybody trying to find the little spot.
[18:21.980 --> 18:24.540]  We had two from Michigan today when I was up there.
[18:24.540 --> 18:27.540]  I get somebody from a different country
[18:27.540 --> 18:28.500]  at least once a week.
[18:28.500 --> 18:29.340]  Nice.
[18:29.340 --> 18:30.180]  There's people from all over the planet.
[18:30.400 --> 18:32.840]  And we had a bunch of just gorgeous girls
[18:32.840 --> 18:34.080]  from New Zealand come through one day.
[18:34.080 --> 18:34.920]  It was awesome.
[18:34.920 --> 18:35.840]  That sounds fun.
[18:35.840 --> 18:39.120]  Like just on the regular people from all over the planet
[18:39.120 --> 18:41.000]  coming to Colorado to smoke weed
[18:41.000 --> 18:42.480]  and they're coming through Pueblo.
[18:42.480 --> 18:44.400]  I have to say that sometimes I go up front
[18:44.400 --> 18:46.260]  and there might be some really beautiful women
[18:46.260 --> 18:47.100]  in the waiting room.
[18:47.100 --> 18:47.920]  Holy crap.
[18:47.920 --> 18:48.880]  Yep.
[18:48.880 --> 18:49.720]  All right.
[18:49.720 --> 18:51.480]  We've gotten way far off topic here, you guys.
[18:51.480 --> 18:52.320]  This is not a spot commercial.
[18:52.320 --> 18:54.160]  Do you want to go for 20 minutes about work?
[18:54.160 --> 18:55.000]  Yeah, a little bit.
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.040]  This is not a spot commercial.
[18:56.040 --> 18:57.240]  We spend a lot of time at work.
[18:57.240 --> 18:59.000]  Some cool shit happens there, yeah.
[18:59.500 --> 19:01.340]  Some cool shit does happen there.
[19:01.340 --> 19:03.340]  I've got a news article that I wanted to talk about.
[19:03.340 --> 19:04.180]  Before we get there, guys,
[19:04.180 --> 19:05.620]  I wanted to tell you what's going on
[19:05.620 --> 19:07.540]  in another realm of my world.
[19:07.540 --> 19:09.540]  I've been talking about Damsel's Dank.
[19:10.460 --> 19:12.140]  If you have not been keeping up,
[19:12.140 --> 19:13.580]  if you don't listen to every single episode,
[19:13.580 --> 19:14.540]  come on, what are you doing?
[19:14.540 --> 19:15.500]  I'm just kidding.
[19:15.500 --> 19:16.420]  You can't listen to everything.
[19:16.420 --> 19:17.260]  I know, I know.
[19:17.260 --> 19:18.460]  There's other shit to listen to.
[19:18.460 --> 19:20.300]  Do your homework, people.
[19:20.300 --> 19:21.260]  There's a suicide girl.
[19:21.260 --> 19:22.100]  She's a friend of mine.
[19:22.100 --> 19:24.820]  If you're not familiar with the Suicide Girls,
[19:24.820 --> 19:26.140]  make yourself familiar with that.
[19:26.140 --> 19:27.180]  Don't do that at work.
[19:27.180 --> 19:28.540]  Don't look at the Suicide Girls.
[19:29.040 --> 19:29.880]  Well, maybe do.
[19:29.880 --> 19:32.040]  It might put a smile on your face.
[19:32.040 --> 19:33.240]  If you work at the spot, go ahead.
[19:33.240 --> 19:34.080]  No, I'm just gonna.
[19:34.080 --> 19:36.000]  Yes, the Suicide Girls are models,
[19:36.000 --> 19:39.240]  and they mostly are tattooed and have some piercings
[19:39.240 --> 19:41.120]  and maybe some dreadlocks here and there.
[19:41.120 --> 19:45.480]  And they're not your normal cover girl model.
[19:45.480 --> 19:47.160]  I think burlesque is the word you're looking for.
[19:47.160 --> 19:48.320]  That might be the word I'm trying
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.400]  to fish out of my brain here.
[19:49.400 --> 19:50.240]  Thanks for the help.
[19:50.240 --> 19:52.820]  All these diesel dabs are making my brain sticky.
[19:52.820 --> 19:56.360]  Anyway, I've got a suicide girl who's a friend of mine.
[19:56.380 --> 20:00.300]  She goes by Duditz Damsel is her Suicide Girl name.
[20:00.300 --> 20:02.260]  She works with Green and Healthy Wellness,
[20:02.260 --> 20:05.140]  a dispensary in Colorado Springs that is now relocating.
[20:05.140 --> 20:06.460]  They're building the new facility.
[20:06.460 --> 20:08.560]  So if you guys are fans of Green and Healthy Wellness,
[20:08.560 --> 20:10.140]  stay tuned, they'll be open pretty soon.
[20:10.140 --> 20:12.860]  I will be announcing the grand opening on the show, I think.
[20:12.860 --> 20:13.940]  I think we talked about that.
[20:13.940 --> 20:15.280]  I think they're on that.
[20:15.280 --> 20:17.660]  Anyway, so Duditz Damsel asked me
[20:17.660 --> 20:19.920]  to develop a strain for her.
[20:19.920 --> 20:22.100]  Right now I have got two.
[20:22.100 --> 20:23.900]  I've started three phenotypes,
[20:23.900 --> 20:25.740]  three different strains from seed
[20:26.080 --> 20:28.320]  that I am going to phenotype from for her.
[20:28.320 --> 20:30.480]  Two of those are now into flower.
[20:30.480 --> 20:33.760]  They are about 48 hours into flower,
[20:33.760 --> 20:35.960]  I think somewhere around there at this point.
[20:35.960 --> 20:38.040]  So in about nine weeks,
[20:38.040 --> 20:42.680]  we will have the first two test batches of Damsel's Dank
[20:42.680 --> 20:45.760]  for Duditz Damsel, my favorite Suicide Girl.
[20:45.760 --> 20:48.360]  Damsel and I and a few other Suicide Girls
[20:48.360 --> 20:50.160]  and my buddy, the Grimy Gatsby
[20:50.160 --> 20:52.240]  and a couple of the Terpy Boys and a few other folks.
[20:52.240 --> 20:53.560]  Mike's giving me the head nod like,
[20:53.620 --> 20:55.540]  wait, you said a few other Suicide Girls.
[20:55.540 --> 20:57.380]  The numbers are looking good here.
[20:57.380 --> 20:58.460]  We're gonna have a tasting party.
[20:58.460 --> 21:01.700]  It'll probably be in Colorado Springs, possibly Denver.
[21:01.700 --> 21:05.540]  I was just hoping on a test kit for myself, but fuck dude.
[21:05.540 --> 21:08.460]  Well, it's depending on how much herb there is,
[21:08.460 --> 21:09.640]  you may get a little sample.
[21:09.640 --> 21:12.080]  You may get a sample of what gets selected
[21:12.080 --> 21:14.860]  because there will be things that she likes
[21:14.860 --> 21:17.620]  that I don't like, that I don't like, that she does like.
[21:17.620 --> 21:18.980]  I think I said that the opposite,
[21:18.980 --> 21:20.860]  but there is the grower and the breeder
[21:20.860 --> 21:22.120]  all like different things than her.
[21:22.140 --> 21:24.540]  For her, we're looking for one specific thing.
[21:24.540 --> 21:26.980]  There may be something that pops out of this search for us
[21:26.980 --> 21:28.980]  that we're gonna keep that has nothing to do with her.
[21:28.980 --> 21:31.340]  Yeah, that's more what I wanted it for
[21:31.340 --> 21:32.920]  is I wanted to get in on the pheno hunt
[21:32.920 --> 21:34.580]  for an entirely different reason.
[21:34.580 --> 21:36.380]  He's like, let's find my new medicine.
[21:36.380 --> 21:38.140]  Yeah, this party sounds kind of awesome too.
[21:38.140 --> 21:41.460]  Yes, the party will be pretty damn fun from what I hear.
[21:41.460 --> 21:43.880]  They know how to throw a party.
[21:43.880 --> 21:45.720]  John Hunt is the Terp gatherer.
[21:46.820 --> 21:48.700]  I just did say that, that is the truth.
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.660]  So they're in flower and like nine weeks,
[21:50.660 --> 21:54.080]  we should have some, in like nine weeks,
[21:54.080 --> 21:56.240]  we should have some damsels dank to sample.
[21:56.240 --> 21:57.080]  It'll be a lot of fun.
[21:57.080 --> 21:59.320]  I'll keep you guys updated on how that goes.
[21:59.320 --> 22:00.560]  They should be here to take some pictures
[22:00.560 --> 22:02.320]  and things pretty soon.
[22:02.320 --> 22:03.400]  That'll be really interesting.
[22:03.400 --> 22:05.120]  I'll try to, we'll try to get damsel
[22:05.120 --> 22:06.560]  on the podcast before too long,
[22:06.560 --> 22:08.880]  but you guys, since Green and Healthy had to relocate
[22:08.880 --> 22:13.360]  without a lot of warning, they are fucking slammed and busy.
[22:13.360 --> 22:15.080]  Yep, yes.
[22:15.080 --> 22:16.720]  Let's see, we've been going 22 minutes.
[22:16.720 --> 22:19.440]  Do we want to read an article or do we want to talk?
[22:19.460 --> 22:21.540]  Yeah, let's go read this news article I've got here
[22:21.540 --> 22:23.700]  because I found this interesting and it's kind of,
[22:23.700 --> 22:25.340]  oh, there we go, gotta get to it.
[22:25.340 --> 22:26.180]  It's kind of important.
[22:26.180 --> 22:27.700]  Maybe this will help some people out
[22:27.700 --> 22:28.940]  and this will definitely interest Mike.
[22:28.940 --> 22:30.620]  Mike doesn't know what I'm going to read.
[22:30.620 --> 22:32.820]  This will definitely get your attention, Mike.
[22:32.820 --> 22:35.620]  The headline says FDA issues warnings
[22:35.620 --> 22:38.660]  to makers of legal CBD hemp oil products.
[22:38.660 --> 22:41.180]  Let me go and find who it's by so I can give them credit.
[22:41.180 --> 22:44.580]  It's by Thomas H. Clark from the Daily Chronic.
[22:44.580 --> 22:46.620]  I found it on the Daily Chronic.
[22:46.620 --> 22:47.620]  We will read the article.
[22:47.620 --> 22:49.380]  It goes a lot like this.
[22:50.320 --> 22:51.160]  Consumers should beware of purchasing
[22:51.160 --> 22:54.240]  and using any such products, the FDA says.
[22:54.240 --> 22:56.200]  The Food and Drug Administration has sent letters
[22:56.200 --> 22:58.840]  to several makers of cannabidiol oils derived from hemp,
[22:58.840 --> 23:00.720]  telling them to stop making medical claims
[23:00.720 --> 23:03.000]  about their product's ability to treat disease.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.160]  Many sellers of the hemp-based cannabidiol products
[23:05.160 --> 23:07.740]  who advertise their products as legal in all 50 states
[23:07.740 --> 23:10.000]  because they are derived from industrial hemp
[23:10.000 --> 23:11.680]  have been making claims that their products
[23:11.680 --> 23:14.000]  are rich in cannabidiol and can be used
[23:14.000 --> 23:16.840]  for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment,
[23:16.860 --> 23:20.580]  or preventation of diseases, according to the FDA.
[23:20.580 --> 23:23.180]  The FDA, which considers CBD an unapproved new drug,
[23:23.180 --> 23:25.780]  said these companies are misbranding the products
[23:25.780 --> 23:28.220]  and issuing false claims to consumers.
[23:28.220 --> 23:30.740]  Often, these products do not even list their ingredients
[23:30.740 --> 23:33.140]  on the product label, the FDA said.
[23:33.140 --> 23:34.580]  Consumers should beware of purchasing
[23:34.580 --> 23:36.560]  and using any such products.
[23:36.560 --> 23:38.600]  It is important to note that these products
[23:38.600 --> 23:42.460]  are not approved by the FDA for the diagnosis, cure,
[23:42.460 --> 23:45.220]  mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.
[23:45.220 --> 23:47.800]  In late February, the FDA issued several warning letters
[23:47.800 --> 23:50.900]  to seven companies that manufacture and market hemp oils,
[23:50.900 --> 23:53.180]  claiming to be rich in CBD.
[23:53.180 --> 23:55.480]  By promising cures for conditions such as cancer,
[23:55.480 --> 23:57.340]  autism, and epilepsy,
[23:57.340 --> 23:59.560]  none of which have been tested by the FDA,
[23:59.560 --> 24:01.360]  the companies who were issued warning letters
[24:01.360 --> 24:05.260]  appear to be violating food and drug labeling laws.
[24:06.380 --> 24:08.720]  In some cases, God, excuse me, hold on,
[24:08.720 --> 24:10.620]  the throat's going crazy here, I'm gonna take a drink.
[24:10.620 --> 24:12.640]  This happens occasionally, we take a lot of dabs.
[24:12.640 --> 24:13.480]  Mug it.
[24:15.940 --> 24:17.560]  Mug it sounds like I'm doing something dirty.
[24:17.560 --> 24:19.800]  He meant take a drink of that delicious root beer.
[24:19.800 --> 24:20.820]  Yep.
[24:20.820 --> 24:21.880]  Mugging it sounds like, I don't know,
[24:21.880 --> 24:23.560]  that just sounded gross.
[24:23.560 --> 24:24.400]  Where am I?
[24:24.400 --> 24:25.220]  I'm right here.
[24:25.220 --> 24:26.640]  In some cases, the companies could not even spell
[24:26.640 --> 24:30.900]  cannabidiol or inflammation correctly, the FDA notes.
[24:30.900 --> 24:32.680]  Yeah, this stuff's been on the market for a while
[24:32.680 --> 24:33.880]  and it's always been crap.
[24:33.880 --> 24:35.280]  Well, one thing that I wanted to get to
[24:35.280 --> 24:39.040]  is a lot of this stuff is brought in from other countries
[24:39.040 --> 24:41.100]  because now that we have got this market,
[24:41.100 --> 24:43.200]  they're doing kind of like what they did with Spice.
[24:43.420 --> 24:46.380]  They see that this CBD stuff is really popular
[24:46.380 --> 24:48.620]  and they're just sending us crap.
[24:48.620 --> 24:51.420]  It may be partially CBD, so they can write that
[24:51.420 --> 24:54.160]  on the bottle, but then it's just other random oils
[24:54.160 --> 24:55.660]  just as a filler, so you don't even know
[24:55.660 --> 24:57.660]  what you're giving these sick kids.
[24:57.660 --> 25:00.260]  You have to get, I'll finish reading the article
[25:00.260 --> 25:02.380]  and then I'll try to remember where I am with this rant.
[25:02.380 --> 25:04.180]  The following companies and products were among those
[25:04.180 --> 25:07.060]  notified by the FDA, and then there are hyperlinks here
[25:07.060 --> 25:10.820]  also, you guys, and it lists a bunch of companies,
[25:10.820 --> 25:14.240]  Cancer, Herbtea.com of Florida, CBD Life Holdings
[25:14.240 --> 25:16.320]  of Arizona, Hemp Oil Care of California,
[25:16.320 --> 25:18.000]  Pure CBD of Washington.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.400]  It lists a bunch of them.
[25:19.400 --> 25:22.400]  And then it also says, the FDA also conducted tests
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.480]  of some products sold by these companies
[25:24.480 --> 25:26.720]  and found that in most cases, the products contained
[25:26.720 --> 25:30.520]  very little cannabidiol or none at all.
[25:30.520 --> 25:31.760]  And there are some bullet points that show
[25:31.760 --> 25:32.720]  some of the test findings.
[25:32.720 --> 25:34.280]  I won't read them all.
[25:34.280 --> 25:37.400]  It says the FDA tested two separate samples of Ultra CBD
[25:37.400 --> 25:41.940]  sold by CBD Life Holdings for its one ounce bottle
[25:41.940 --> 25:45.060]  for $45 on their website or on Amazon.
[25:45.060 --> 25:48.580]  Of the samples tested, one did not contain any cannabinoids,
[25:48.580 --> 25:52.580]  while the second contained only 0.02% CBD.
[25:52.580 --> 25:54.940]  All the products tested by the FDA that were found
[25:54.940 --> 25:57.900]  to contain some CBD, the Ultra CBD products
[25:57.900 --> 26:00.300]  contained the smallest percentage.
[26:00.300 --> 26:02.400]  So you guys are paying for stuff that doesn't even have
[26:02.400 --> 26:04.980]  any CBD in it, which is gonna make me wonder,
[26:04.980 --> 26:06.320]  what is in it?
[26:07.220 --> 26:10.020]  This is a big issue for a lot of East Coast states
[26:10.020 --> 26:12.260]  that have passed Charlotte's Web style laws
[26:12.260 --> 26:15.700]  that allow for CBD only products,
[26:15.700 --> 26:19.940]  but they don't allow for you to get them anywhere.
[26:19.940 --> 26:22.460]  Essentially, the law requires you to come to Colorado
[26:22.460 --> 26:24.860]  or another legal state, buy something,
[26:24.860 --> 26:27.060]  and then break a bunch of federal laws on your way home.
[26:27.060 --> 26:28.740]  By taking it home.
[26:28.740 --> 26:31.140]  And then, yeah, if you're able to smuggle it home,
[26:31.140 --> 26:33.660]  you can go ahead and then legally use it.
[26:33.660 --> 26:35.460]  But that's mildly insane.
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.320]  So when you're Googling and you see,
[26:37.320 --> 26:40.520]  hey, hemp oil, CBD legal in all 50 states.
[26:40.520 --> 26:42.640]  It doesn't even say hemp oil, it's CBD oil
[26:42.640 --> 26:44.200]  is what this one package says.
[26:44.200 --> 26:47.240]  If you're lucky, you're getting hemp seed extract.
[26:48.440 --> 26:49.280]  If you're lucky.
[26:49.280 --> 26:50.200]  Yep, if you're lucky.
[26:50.200 --> 26:53.900]  If not, you're getting the bottom layer of whatever oil
[26:53.900 --> 26:56.640]  some company in China makes and decided to bottle up
[26:56.640 --> 26:59.760]  and label it as THC or CBD oil, right?
[26:59.760 --> 27:00.960]  Yep.
[27:00.960 --> 27:01.980]  So the article keeps going.
[27:01.980 --> 27:03.440]  I wanna finish this up just so we can finish
[27:03.440 --> 27:04.560]  the whole article.
[27:04.580 --> 27:07.420]  It says the warned CBD companies have 15 days
[27:07.420 --> 27:09.740]  to follow the FDA, to show the FDA
[27:09.740 --> 27:11.660]  how they are complying with the warning letters.
[27:11.660 --> 27:15.020]  Failure to comply to, failure to promptly correct
[27:15.020 --> 27:17.700]  these violations may result in legal action
[27:17.700 --> 27:20.300]  without further notice, including without limitation,
[27:20.300 --> 27:23.140]  seizure and or injunction, the FDA warns.
[27:24.520 --> 27:26.420]  Medical marijuana experts suggest patients
[27:26.420 --> 27:28.820]  considering CBD treatment to instead seek
[27:28.820 --> 27:31.580]  CBD rich strains of cannabis grown in states
[27:31.580 --> 27:34.340]  that allow medical marijuana, such as Colorado,
[27:35.080 --> 27:37.360]  who also require independent laboratory testing
[27:37.360 --> 27:39.940]  of all marijuana products.
[27:39.940 --> 27:43.440]  So medical experts are even saying, what Mike and I say,
[27:44.360 --> 27:48.440]  go to Colorado and get some lab tested,
[27:48.440 --> 27:51.720]  facility grown, quality cannabis that's safe,
[27:51.720 --> 27:53.520]  that doesn't have any pesticides in it,
[27:53.520 --> 27:56.160]  because if it does, it's been quarantined and taken away.
[27:56.160 --> 27:59.900]  Like we're almost to where we need to be regulatory wise
[27:59.900 --> 28:00.800]  here in Colorado.
[28:00.800 --> 28:04.040]  They're going the wrong direction with their new regulations
[28:04.740 --> 28:06.700]  but where they need to be adding stuff
[28:06.700 --> 28:08.080]  is in pesticide testing.
[28:08.080 --> 28:10.060]  Those regulations aren't up to speed yet
[28:10.060 --> 28:12.320]  because the testing labs aren't in place yet
[28:12.320 --> 28:14.500]  because the FDA won't certify testing,
[28:14.500 --> 28:18.020]  like it just spirals because of our dumb ass prohibition
[28:18.020 --> 28:18.860]  to this plant.
[28:18.860 --> 28:19.700]  Well, everybody that listens to the show
[28:19.700 --> 28:20.640]  knows what I'm gonna say.
[28:20.640 --> 28:24.420]  The solution there is to legalize it nationally.
[28:24.420 --> 28:25.980]  Just do it already.
[28:25.980 --> 28:26.820]  Yeah.
[28:26.820 --> 28:28.620]  And then the FDA would already be overseeing
[28:28.620 --> 28:30.040]  all this hemp seed extract shit.
[28:30.040 --> 28:34.260]  You'd be able to legally confidently buy CBD oil.
[28:34.260 --> 28:35.780]  That's legit CBD oil.
[28:35.780 --> 28:37.100]  You'd know what you were taking
[28:37.100 --> 28:38.620]  or giving your kid or whatever.
[28:38.620 --> 28:39.680]  Yeah.
[28:39.680 --> 28:41.760]  So this is partially like to warn people,
[28:41.760 --> 28:44.180]  if you're buying this crappy CBD oil,
[28:44.180 --> 28:47.860]  you're probably not getting any help for your ailment.
[28:47.860 --> 28:51.460]  Hey, if it's like, what if it's a placebo effect,
[28:51.460 --> 28:53.780]  if it's working and you felt better, what do you think?
[28:53.780 --> 28:55.360]  Should they quit doing it?
[28:55.360 --> 28:56.200]  I don't know.
[28:56.200 --> 28:57.620]  Cause maybe they're taking some weird shit.
[28:57.620 --> 28:59.820]  I'm not telling you to take or not to take anything.
[29:00.800 --> 29:01.640]  There you go.
[29:01.640 --> 29:03.600]  If something works, it works for a reason.
[29:03.600 --> 29:04.440]  Yeah.
[29:04.440 --> 29:06.620]  But who knows what you're taking guys.
[29:06.620 --> 29:08.400]  So the advice here is to come to Colorado
[29:08.400 --> 29:11.360]  or legalize it where you are, fight for legalization.
[29:11.360 --> 29:14.800]  And my guidance is when it comes time to legalize
[29:14.800 --> 29:19.000]  in your area, don't pass CBD only legislation.
[29:19.000 --> 29:24.000]  Pass cannabis, like recreational or medical cannabis use
[29:24.240 --> 29:26.200]  to where you can consume flour,
[29:26.200 --> 29:27.960]  to where you can make extracts,
[29:27.980 --> 29:30.500]  to where you can consume extracts and edibles,
[29:30.500 --> 29:31.780]  make it all part of that.
[29:31.780 --> 29:36.140]  Because just the CBD is only going to work
[29:36.140 --> 29:40.460]  for a very small portion of the medical cannabis community.
[29:40.460 --> 29:43.140]  CBD doesn't do a damn thing for me.
[29:43.140 --> 29:44.940]  Like I need my THC.
[29:44.940 --> 29:45.780]  I need a high THC.
[29:45.780 --> 29:47.860]  CBD does wonders for me.
[29:47.860 --> 29:48.780]  Right, right.
[29:48.780 --> 29:52.100]  And I have a CBD episode coming up on the future.
[29:52.100 --> 29:53.300]  And guys, I know I keep saying that,
[29:53.300 --> 29:54.200]  but I'm putting it together.
[29:54.200 --> 29:55.760]  There are some episodes I can throw together
[29:55.760 --> 29:56.600]  in like a day or two.
[29:56.600 --> 29:58.860]  The CBD episode is going to take me quite a while.
[29:58.860 --> 30:00.260]  It's going to be a series.
[30:00.260 --> 30:01.980]  I'm going to get several people to talk on it
[30:01.980 --> 30:03.860]  and tell us how CBD treats them.
[30:03.860 --> 30:05.660]  But Mike is definitely going to be one of the people
[30:05.660 --> 30:06.500]  on there.
[30:06.500 --> 30:07.340]  Find some medical patient.
[30:07.340 --> 30:08.900]  It's a really big topic, folks.
[30:08.900 --> 30:10.020]  It is a huge topic.
[30:10.020 --> 30:11.580]  It deserves some good prep.
[30:11.580 --> 30:13.300]  I've got a lot of notes on it already.
[30:13.300 --> 30:14.740]  Doug is going to be part of that show.
[30:14.740 --> 30:15.940]  Mike will be part of that show.
[30:15.940 --> 30:18.300]  We'll get a lot of people on there.
[30:18.300 --> 30:20.340]  I just met a few people recently that are well-known
[30:20.340 --> 30:22.020]  in the CBD community.
[30:22.020 --> 30:24.420]  So that'll help us out.
[30:24.440 --> 30:27.600]  And we're finally starting to get CBD products
[30:27.600 --> 30:30.040]  reliably in the rec market.
[30:30.040 --> 30:30.960]  I got all tongue-tied.
[30:30.960 --> 30:31.800]  My mouth's dry.
[30:31.800 --> 30:32.620]  I noticed that.
[30:32.620 --> 30:33.460]  Yeah, I was impressed.
[30:33.460 --> 30:35.600]  We were talking to the purchaser for the shop
[30:35.600 --> 30:36.880]  and he was asking us what,
[30:36.880 --> 30:38.280]  he asked us for guidance.
[30:38.280 --> 30:39.720]  He knows that we're potheads.
[30:39.720 --> 30:40.920]  He's like, what should I buy, guys?
[30:40.920 --> 30:43.360]  And he showed us an order that he was able to get
[30:43.360 --> 30:45.120]  really high CBD products.
[30:45.120 --> 30:46.960]  And we encouraged him to do that for the rec shop
[30:46.960 --> 30:49.760]  so that we've got that available for people as well.
[30:49.760 --> 30:50.600]  Come check it out, you guys.
[30:50.600 --> 30:51.840]  Try some CBD.
[30:51.840 --> 30:52.680]  See what it does for you.
[30:52.680 --> 30:54.420]  It may help you out.
[30:54.420 --> 30:55.660]  Some people it's the miracle.
[30:55.660 --> 30:57.180]  For me, it is nothing.
[30:57.180 --> 30:59.780]  But so like I'm saying, don't go with the CBD only
[30:59.780 --> 31:02.900]  because CBD only wouldn't do anything for me.
[31:02.900 --> 31:05.460]  It's the synergistic effect is what we're searching for
[31:05.460 --> 31:06.300]  in my opinion.
[31:06.300 --> 31:08.880]  We need a little bit of THC to make it all work.
[31:08.880 --> 31:12.720]  I think it's all one unified thing.
[31:12.720 --> 31:13.560]  That's my opinion.
[31:13.560 --> 31:14.800]  So when it comes time to legalize, guys,
[31:14.800 --> 31:16.440]  make sure you don't just do CBD.
[31:17.780 --> 31:18.740]  All right, I need to give a shout out
[31:18.740 --> 31:19.900]  to the author of this article.
[31:19.900 --> 31:21.020]  I like to remind you who it was.
[31:21.160 --> 31:24.080]  Thomas H. Clark from the Daily Chronic, you guys.
[31:24.080 --> 31:27.680]  Be careful if you're using hemp oil CBD products.
[31:27.680 --> 31:29.480]  Don't make yourself sicker than you already are.
[31:29.480 --> 31:30.560]  Know what you're using.
[31:30.560 --> 31:32.560]  If you're buying stuff from a shop
[31:32.560 --> 31:36.080]  and it doesn't have lab testing, start asking for it.
[31:36.080 --> 31:37.800]  It's just a matter of time
[31:37.800 --> 31:39.440]  until this is just like everything else.
[31:39.440 --> 31:41.040]  When you go to a store and buy something,
[31:41.040 --> 31:42.080]  you know what you're buying.
[31:42.080 --> 31:45.240]  You can look at the label on it and know what's in it
[31:45.240 --> 31:48.440]  and be sure that what's on the label is actually in it
[31:48.460 --> 31:52.220]  because the FDA is testing this thing randomly.
[31:52.220 --> 31:54.680]  Yes, well now we have the MED backing you up.
[31:54.680 --> 31:56.940]  Well, in Colorado, the FDA is not allowed to
[31:56.940 --> 32:00.780]  so we literally had to create from the ground up our own.
[32:00.780 --> 32:05.300]  MED, they do, I mean, I remember when the first testing labs
[32:05.300 --> 32:07.420]  were open, the state didn't give a shit.
[32:07.420 --> 32:09.060]  That was the industry demanding it.
[32:09.060 --> 32:11.420]  Patients were beginning to demand it.
[32:11.420 --> 32:14.620]  Shops needed to know what they were putting out and testing.
[32:14.620 --> 32:17.000]  Back in the day, I was able to take my product,
[32:17.000 --> 32:20.580]  my finished flowers, my hash to a shop and have it tested.
[32:20.580 --> 32:23.940]  There's discussions of reopening labs to caregivers.
[32:23.940 --> 32:25.140]  I hope so because right now
[32:25.140 --> 32:27.140]  they've locked down the rules so tight.
[32:27.140 --> 32:28.700]  Well, part of the thing is that the shops
[32:28.700 --> 32:29.900]  have them so overwhelmed.
[32:29.900 --> 32:31.660]  There are so few labs that are qualified
[32:31.660 --> 32:33.580]  that right now if I wanted to take my product,
[32:33.580 --> 32:35.100]  I'd probably have to wait a month anyway
[32:35.100 --> 32:37.180]  so they just disallowed us to be able to do it.
[32:37.180 --> 32:38.740]  There's one type of testing
[32:38.740 --> 32:41.540]  and I honestly can't remember what it is.
[32:41.540 --> 32:43.980]  It's not potency but I can't remember
[32:43.980 --> 32:46.880]  what the specialty tests that we were hoping
[32:47.740 --> 32:48.580]  to get done.
[32:48.580 --> 32:50.020]  There's only one lab and it's in Durango.
[32:50.020 --> 32:51.780]  Oh, it's a residual solvent test
[32:51.780 --> 32:52.620]  is what you guys are looking for.
[32:52.620 --> 32:54.540]  That's only for hash.
[32:54.540 --> 32:56.500]  They can only do that in Durango
[32:56.500 --> 32:58.380]  and so we're literally discussing
[32:58.380 --> 33:00.080]  who we're gonna send to Durango.
[33:01.420 --> 33:02.260]  I think.
[33:02.260 --> 33:03.660]  Because we can't send stuff through the mail
[33:03.660 --> 33:05.160]  to the testing labs so one of us
[33:05.160 --> 33:07.420]  is gonna draw the short straw
[33:07.420 --> 33:09.820]  and drive like 14 hours across the state.
[33:09.820 --> 33:11.140]  That's 14 hours?
[33:11.140 --> 33:12.580]  I'm ball parking.
[33:12.580 --> 33:13.740]  Okay.
[33:13.740 --> 33:14.640]  I might need a day off.
[33:14.640 --> 33:15.480]  That'll be fun.
[33:16.940 --> 33:18.180]  It's the opposite of fun, bro.
[33:18.180 --> 33:20.300]  I think Steep Hill Halen can possibly
[33:20.300 --> 33:22.380]  do those same tests but I'm not sure.
[33:22.380 --> 33:23.660]  I can't, don't quote me there.
[33:23.660 --> 33:25.340]  Yeah, that was a discussion I overheard
[33:25.340 --> 33:26.460]  a couple of months ago.
[33:26.460 --> 33:27.980]  Yeah, I heard part of that today actually.
[33:27.980 --> 33:29.780]  We were talking about labs and such today
[33:29.780 --> 33:31.460]  in one of the offices.
[33:31.460 --> 33:32.300]  Awesome.
[33:32.300 --> 33:33.900]  Too much talk about work on this episode, huh guys?
[33:33.900 --> 33:34.740]  Leave it in the comments.
[33:34.740 --> 33:36.500]  Sorry, it's what we did all day.
[33:36.500 --> 33:37.340]  Jeez.
[33:37.340 --> 33:40.260]  Yeah, it's been like 10 days without a day off.
[33:40.260 --> 33:41.620]  It's all I think about right now.
[33:41.620 --> 33:43.340]  We've been gone about 33 minutes.
[33:43.340 --> 33:44.540]  Dude, I've got a couple more things here
[33:44.540 --> 33:45.380]  that I'm gonna save
[33:45.400 --> 33:47.480]  because this right here is gonna take a while.
[33:47.480 --> 33:48.640]  I wanted to talk about,
[33:48.640 --> 33:50.320]  I'm just gonna give it a couple of quick seconds here.
[33:50.320 --> 33:52.420]  Then we don't have to get too much into it.
[33:53.360 --> 33:54.720]  You guys follow the UFC a lot.
[33:54.720 --> 33:56.560]  I'm not a huge UFC follower.
[33:56.560 --> 33:58.760]  I follow Joe Rogan more than I follow the UFC
[33:58.760 --> 34:00.040]  but that's attached.
[34:00.040 --> 34:01.700]  That's my third degree of separation
[34:01.700 --> 34:03.040]  or whatever you're gonna call it.
[34:03.040 --> 34:04.720]  But there is something that happened in the UFC
[34:04.720 --> 34:06.880]  that as a pothead, as a cannabis activist,
[34:06.880 --> 34:09.440]  as somebody who was part of the marijuana community,
[34:09.440 --> 34:10.480]  this got my attention.
[34:10.480 --> 34:13.560]  There's a UFC fighter who tested positive
[34:13.580 --> 34:16.720]  for using cannabis who has been suspended for five years.
[34:18.420 --> 34:19.340]  Five years, dude.
[34:19.340 --> 34:21.900]  His career has been put on hold.
[34:21.900 --> 34:24.220]  His salary has been put on hold
[34:24.220 --> 34:27.700]  and they also fined him $150,000
[34:27.700 --> 34:31.140]  for failing a P-test for cannabis.
[34:32.980 --> 34:33.980]  I think that's kind of silly.
[34:33.980 --> 34:34.820]  I don't think-
[34:34.820 --> 34:35.660]  It's insane.
[34:35.660 --> 34:37.500]  Yeah, this dude, that's his job.
[34:37.500 --> 34:40.100]  That's what this guy has trained his whole life for.
[34:40.100 --> 34:41.380]  And now he's-
[34:41.380 --> 34:44.280]  It's totally insane.
[34:44.280 --> 34:47.520]  And there's a couple of different reasons why it's insane.
[34:47.520 --> 34:51.360]  If it was steroids, this would be a little insane.
[34:51.360 --> 34:53.700]  Five years is an insanely long amount of time.
[34:53.700 --> 34:55.840]  It's not a performance enhancing drug.
[34:56.840 --> 34:58.880]  It's been shown to be helpful in protecting
[34:58.880 --> 35:01.320]  against concussions and recovering from head injuries.
[35:01.320 --> 35:02.160]  Yes, absolutely.
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.240]  These guys get punched and kicked in the face for a living.
[35:04.240 --> 35:05.320]  That's his job, yeah.
[35:05.320 --> 35:08.240]  Yeah, there's a thousand different reasons
[35:08.240 --> 35:09.080]  why this is insane.
[35:09.100 --> 35:12.580]  And I loved, I'm going to probably butcher her name,
[35:12.580 --> 35:15.100]  so I apologize because she could for sure kick my ass,
[35:15.100 --> 35:16.540]  but I think it's Ronda Rousey.
[35:16.540 --> 35:17.380]  Oh, you nailed her name.
[35:17.380 --> 35:19.500]  Just independently went off during a press conference
[35:19.500 --> 35:21.060]  and I saw that video.
[35:21.060 --> 35:21.900]  Oh yeah, and she said-
[35:21.900 --> 35:23.900]  I've only peripherally followed this story,
[35:23.900 --> 35:27.140]  but she went off for basically the same reasons I did.
[35:27.140 --> 35:29.260]  Right, to misquote Ronda Rousey,
[35:29.260 --> 35:31.020]  but to paraphrase and misquote her,
[35:31.020 --> 35:33.180]  basically what she said was,
[35:33.180 --> 35:37.860]  if somebody uses steroids and they're in a ring fighting,
[35:37.860 --> 35:39.580]  that potentially gives them the ability
[35:39.580 --> 35:41.500]  to hit me harder and kill me.
[35:41.500 --> 35:43.680]  But if they are smoking cannabis,
[35:43.680 --> 35:46.120]  that gives them the ability to heal themselves.
[35:46.120 --> 35:49.960]  They're smoking a plant that was put here for us to smoke
[35:49.960 --> 35:51.800]  and we're going to punish people for it
[35:51.800 --> 35:53.240]  is basically what she said.
[35:53.240 --> 35:55.160]  I'm going to fuck it all up, I already told you that.
[35:55.160 --> 35:56.560]  But I totally agree with her.
[35:56.560 --> 36:00.080]  Ronda Rousey is absolutely on the money with that.
[36:00.080 --> 36:00.920]  There is a petition.
[36:00.920 --> 36:02.640]  I'm not going to beg you guys to sign the petition.
[36:02.640 --> 36:04.200]  I haven't signed it yet, but if you guys want,
[36:04.200 --> 36:06.240]  if you're into the UFC and you think it's wrong
[36:06.240 --> 36:07.740]  that this dude's been suspended,
[36:08.560 --> 36:11.880]  here's the thing, they did give him three P tests
[36:11.880 --> 36:14.360]  and two of them were clean.
[36:14.360 --> 36:16.480]  And this third one was not even necessary.
[36:16.480 --> 36:18.200]  It was by, I've got a news article on the screen
[36:18.200 --> 36:19.360]  that I was going to read,
[36:19.360 --> 36:21.600]  but I didn't even want to get that far into this.
[36:21.600 --> 36:25.560]  But it says, DS submitted three urine samples on the night,
[36:25.560 --> 36:28.960]  one prior to his fight and two in the hours afterward.
[36:28.960 --> 36:30.580]  I'm really going quickly through this.
[36:30.580 --> 36:31.420]  Of those three samples,
[36:31.420 --> 36:33.400]  the first and the third administered
[36:33.400 --> 36:35.720]  under the World Anti-Doping Agency Protocol
[36:35.740 --> 36:38.460]  and submitted for testing to the WADA,
[36:38.460 --> 36:40.500]  Accredited Sports Medicine Research
[36:40.500 --> 36:42.060]  and Testing Lab in Salt Lake City.
[36:42.060 --> 36:44.960]  Both of those came back clean.
[36:44.960 --> 36:49.020]  So that's the World Anti-Doping Agency.
[36:49.020 --> 36:50.540]  You can't cheat that P test.
[36:50.540 --> 36:52.220]  I don't care how bad you are.
[36:52.220 --> 36:53.300]  They see your wiener.
[36:53.300 --> 36:54.660]  They see your dick when you're peeing.
[36:54.660 --> 36:57.540]  They watch the pee come out of the head of your pee hole.
[36:57.540 --> 36:59.860]  Like it comes, they watch it into the container
[36:59.860 --> 37:01.620]  and then they fucking seal it themselves.
[37:01.620 --> 37:02.660]  They're wearing rubber gloves
[37:02.660 --> 37:04.300]  and catching it for you basically.
[37:04.320 --> 37:06.680]  It's not the only reason I'm not an MMA fighter,
[37:06.680 --> 37:08.440]  but it's on the fucking list.
[37:08.440 --> 37:10.240]  But then it says, however,
[37:12.880 --> 37:14.280]  the 10 30 PM test, however,
[37:14.280 --> 37:16.480]  was administered by a separate testing representative
[37:16.480 --> 37:18.680]  and submitted to Quest Diagnostics,
[37:18.680 --> 37:20.780]  a non-WADA accredited lab.
[37:20.780 --> 37:23.000]  So that lab is not even accredited.
[37:23.000 --> 37:24.680]  That test came back over the threshold
[37:24.680 --> 37:26.800]  for allowable marijuana metabolites,
[37:26.800 --> 37:30.040]  resulting in the lone positive test.
[37:30.040 --> 37:32.760]  This company that tested him isn't even accredited
[37:32.780 --> 37:35.180]  by the World Anti-Doping Agency.
[37:35.180 --> 37:36.620]  And they did pass their,
[37:36.620 --> 37:39.380]  look, what the fuck Las Vegas Sporting,
[37:39.380 --> 37:40.260]  whatever you're called,
[37:40.260 --> 37:43.080]  the Nevada Sporting and something commission.
[37:43.080 --> 37:44.060]  I'm not cool with you guys.
[37:44.060 --> 37:44.900]  This sucks.
[37:44.900 --> 37:46.660]  You guys need to go just sign the petition
[37:46.660 --> 37:49.340]  so that Nick Diaz can get back, get his career back.
[37:49.340 --> 37:51.700]  Five years for a UFC fighter, dude.
[37:51.700 --> 37:54.660]  That would, that's like half of your career.
[37:54.660 --> 37:56.980]  You know, you only get to go from your early twenties
[37:56.980 --> 38:00.100]  until maybe 30 something, unless you're a bad motherfucker.
[38:00.100 --> 38:01.540]  Once you get in the mid thirties,
[38:01.540 --> 38:03.040]  testosterone starts dropping.
[38:03.040 --> 38:03.880]  You can't take a punch as well.
[38:03.880 --> 38:06.280]  This is gonna come back like Tyson after prison.
[38:06.280 --> 38:08.560]  The fucking knee blows out or something.
[38:08.560 --> 38:10.760]  What do you mean, talking silly and chasing pigeons?
[38:10.760 --> 38:12.760]  No, like destroying people with half a punch.
[38:12.760 --> 38:14.200]  Just destroying people.
[38:15.080 --> 38:16.040]  It might be neat to see,
[38:16.040 --> 38:18.160]  but I don't want to have to wait five years to see it.
[38:18.160 --> 38:20.040]  I think the dude should get to be able to fight.
[38:20.040 --> 38:22.080]  For me, this is just another example
[38:22.080 --> 38:25.600]  of why everyone needs to get involved and get educated.
[38:25.600 --> 38:28.620]  Like this guy doesn't get to fight for five years
[38:28.620 --> 38:29.800]  because he peed dirty.
[38:29.800 --> 38:33.500]  Other people are losing their kids because they pee dirty.
[38:33.500 --> 38:35.060]  Like other people are going to jail
[38:35.060 --> 38:37.820]  because they're selling people pot that people want.
[38:37.820 --> 38:39.500]  Because we want to smoke a plant
[38:39.500 --> 38:41.100]  while other people can drink some shit
[38:41.100 --> 38:42.860]  that makes them drive like maniacs.
[38:42.860 --> 38:45.040]  And oh, I can't blame it on alcohol.
[38:45.040 --> 38:47.380]  But yeah, because people want to smoke a plant.
[38:47.380 --> 38:48.220]  We're going to jail.
[38:48.220 --> 38:49.780]  We're not allowed to have the careers we want.
[38:49.780 --> 38:50.900]  This dude can't fight.
[38:50.900 --> 38:52.140]  This is terrible.
[38:52.140 --> 38:53.500]  Because we all hang back.
[38:53.500 --> 38:55.740]  Like we all get shit on regularly.
[38:57.300 --> 38:58.900]  All right, I think that's enough for Nick Diaz.
[38:58.920 --> 39:00.460]  Support that you guys, I do.
[39:01.920 --> 39:03.620]  Mike, thanks for joining me, bro.
[39:03.620 --> 39:06.560]  Didn't want to end on a down note.
[39:06.560 --> 39:09.280]  No, well what positive shit you got for us?
[39:09.280 --> 39:11.280]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for you.
[39:11.280 --> 39:12.120]  That's my line, bro.
[39:12.120 --> 39:13.540]  There's more shit to go.
[39:15.160 --> 39:16.920]  I was looking for something positive there
[39:16.920 --> 39:18.440]  and that's the first thing that popped into my head.
[39:18.440 --> 39:20.440]  The positive thing is that we will be back,
[39:20.440 --> 39:22.480]  or at least I will be back next Monday.
[39:22.480 --> 39:24.360]  I'll have a whole nother episode for you.
[39:24.360 --> 39:25.640]  We're going to talk about.
[39:27.040 --> 39:27.880]  Stuff.
[39:27.880 --> 39:28.720]  Well, I've been.
[39:28.720 --> 39:29.540]  That's cannabis related.
[39:29.540 --> 39:30.380]  I've been in an argument.
[39:30.380 --> 39:33.620]  Not an argument, a discussion with a stranger on Facebook
[39:33.620 --> 39:36.180]  about is holding your smoke a good idea?
[39:36.180 --> 39:39.340]  He thinks you get higher from holding your smoke.
[39:39.340 --> 39:40.420]  That was his statement.
[39:40.420 --> 39:43.060]  And then we'll talk about other people's theories,
[39:43.060 --> 39:43.880]  including mine.
[39:43.880 --> 39:45.260]  If you'd like to be involved in this,
[39:45.260 --> 39:46.700]  we will schedule this for a time
[39:46.700 --> 39:49.140]  when Mike can return for the podcast.
[39:49.140 --> 39:49.980]  Interesting topic.
[39:49.980 --> 39:50.820]  Because I'd like to get your,
[39:50.820 --> 39:51.820]  well, it's not going to be the whole show,
[39:51.820 --> 39:53.540]  but that's, definitely you're going to hear
[39:53.540 --> 39:54.740]  my opinion on that.
[39:54.740 --> 39:56.860]  So if somebody else would like to come and be on that,
[39:56.860 --> 39:58.600]  I think that it's not a good idea.
[39:58.600 --> 40:00.160]  So if you think it's a good idea, message me.
[40:00.160 --> 40:01.720]  I'd like your opinion.
[40:01.720 --> 40:02.880]  There should be an email, Jeff.
[40:02.880 --> 40:03.720]  That's right.
[40:03.720 --> 40:04.720]  Send me your opinion either way.
[40:04.720 --> 40:05.560]  Holding your smoke.
[40:05.560 --> 40:07.120]  When you take a bong hit, when you take a dab,
[40:07.120 --> 40:08.880]  when you take a smoke off of a joint,
[40:08.880 --> 40:11.200]  do you think it's a good idea to hold in your smoke
[40:11.200 --> 40:12.280]  for a few seconds?
[40:12.280 --> 40:15.160]  How long do you think you should hold in your smoke?
[40:15.160 --> 40:17.320]  Do you hold in your smoke differently for your dab
[40:17.320 --> 40:18.400]  than you do a joint?
[40:19.560 --> 40:20.400]  Let me hear it.
[40:20.400 --> 40:21.720]  Do you think it's, you want to hold your smoke
[40:21.720 --> 40:23.360]  or do you want to just in and out?
[40:23.360 --> 40:24.200]  How long do you hold it?
[40:24.200 --> 40:26.000]  Do you think if you hold it for 10 or 15 seconds,
[40:26.020 --> 40:26.940]  you're getting higher?
[40:26.940 --> 40:29.140]  Let me hear your opinion on that shit.
[40:29.140 --> 40:32.020]  You can tweet it to me if it's under 140 characters.
[40:32.020 --> 40:33.800]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[40:33.800 --> 40:36.140]  If it's longer than that, you're going to have to email me
[40:36.140 --> 40:38.820]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[40:38.820 --> 40:41.180]  Or of course you can hit me up on the Facebook.
[40:41.180 --> 40:43.140]  Just find me, it's growfromyourheart.
[40:43.140 --> 40:45.540]  If you're one of my friends, just fucking text me, bro.
[40:45.540 --> 40:48.900]  It's so funny when I get text messages about the show.
[40:48.900 --> 40:49.740]  You should talk about this.
[40:49.740 --> 40:51.780]  And I'm like, I'm going to delete your text message.
[40:51.780 --> 40:53.740]  You can all forget because I delete all my messages.
[40:53.740 --> 40:55.260]  But anyway, I'm rambling now.
[40:55.280 --> 40:56.600]  Contact me, let me know what you think
[40:56.600 --> 40:58.500]  about holding in your smoke.
[40:58.500 --> 41:00.060]  That's what's coming up on a future episode.
[41:00.060 --> 41:02.440]  Are you trying to think about more positive shit over there?
[41:02.440 --> 41:03.280]  I see you like,
[41:03.280 --> 41:04.120]  you're saying enough.
[41:04.120 --> 41:05.480]  I'm also rattling through my brain
[41:05.480 --> 41:07.520]  about what I've read about holding in the smoke.
[41:07.520 --> 41:10.880]  Because yeah, there's multiple opinions on this topic.
[41:10.880 --> 41:11.720]  It's interesting.
[41:11.720 --> 41:12.920]  Yeah, we'll save that one.
[41:12.920 --> 41:14.840]  We'll get that out on another episode.
[41:15.720 --> 41:17.080]  Yeah, let's wrap up the show, man.
[41:17.080 --> 41:18.660]  I'm trying to think of some positive shit.
[41:18.660 --> 41:20.040]  We're here, you're here.
[41:20.040 --> 41:21.720]  Okay, here's some positive shit.
[41:21.720 --> 41:24.900]  Did you read that the CERN Large Hadron Collider
[41:25.540 --> 41:27.280]  was supposed to open up two black holes,
[41:27.280 --> 41:28.560]  which is going to open a wormhole
[41:28.560 --> 41:29.760]  and the earth was going to be swallowed
[41:29.760 --> 41:31.040]  and we're all going to die.
[41:31.040 --> 41:33.120]  That was supposed to happen on the 23rd
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.880]  and we're recording on the 24th.
[41:35.880 --> 41:37.240]  So guess what?
[41:37.240 --> 41:38.080]  We survived.
[41:38.080 --> 41:38.900]  We didn't die.
[41:38.900 --> 41:40.000]  So that's a positive note.
[41:40.000 --> 41:40.840]  We're here.
[41:40.840 --> 41:43.240]  Bruce Willis destroyed the meteor again, y'all.
[41:43.240 --> 41:44.080]  Cheers it up.
[41:44.080 --> 41:47.960]  How come Bruce Willis gets to be the hero in this story?
[41:47.960 --> 41:50.000]  I thought it would be Arnold Schwarzenegger or something.
[41:50.000 --> 41:51.560]  No, he got to be the governor.
[41:51.560 --> 41:52.400]  Okay.
[41:52.400 --> 41:53.220]  That's all he gets.
[41:53.220 --> 41:54.520]  Yeah, Bruce Willis is just old and bald.
[41:55.140 --> 41:55.980]  We'll give him the win on this one.
[41:55.980 --> 41:56.820]  Yep.
[41:56.820 --> 41:57.900]  He needs something right now.
[41:57.900 --> 41:59.340]  All right, guys, we're going to wrap up the show.
[41:59.340 --> 42:02.340]  Mike and I are fucking chatty and high as shit.
[42:02.340 --> 42:03.620]  Yeah, diesel dabs, y'all.
[42:03.620 --> 42:05.840]  Those diesel dabs made me sativa-eyed.
[42:07.220 --> 42:08.740]  Made me sativa everything.
[42:08.740 --> 42:09.900]  All right, bro, I want to thank you for coming
[42:09.900 --> 42:11.380]  and hanging out, taking an hour out of your day.
[42:11.380 --> 42:12.400]  You got a new baby at home.
[42:12.400 --> 42:13.700]  Congratulations on that.
[42:13.700 --> 42:14.540]  Thank you.
[42:14.540 --> 42:15.940]  Thanks for taking time away from that little guy
[42:15.940 --> 42:16.780]  to come hang out with me.
[42:16.780 --> 42:18.580]  I know what that's like, prying you away from him.
[42:18.580 --> 42:19.420]  Right.
[42:19.420 --> 42:20.380]  I'm sure you want to get back there.
[42:20.380 --> 42:21.980]  So we'll wrap this up.
[42:21.980 --> 42:23.020]  Make sure you guys follow Mike.
[42:23.020 --> 42:25.360]  It's Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[42:25.360 --> 42:27.840]  Let him know that you found him here on the podcast.
[42:27.840 --> 42:29.460]  He likes to know where the followers came from,
[42:29.460 --> 42:31.160]  where his stalkers arrived from.
[42:31.160 --> 42:32.800]  Yep, sometimes it's easy to tell.
[42:32.800 --> 42:34.840]  Like when it's 2 a.m. and I haven't tweeted
[42:34.840 --> 42:38.500]  in a day and a half, and it's a stonery name in photo,
[42:38.500 --> 42:39.400]  I can assume.
[42:39.400 --> 42:41.880]  Other times, I have no fucking clue.
[42:41.880 --> 42:43.720]  Like Dabby McDabberson just followed me.
[42:43.720 --> 42:45.400]  I bet that's from the podcast.
[42:45.400 --> 42:46.220]  Right.
[42:46.220 --> 42:47.060]  Nice.
[42:47.060 --> 42:47.900]  Somebody's going to make up a screen name
[42:47.900 --> 42:49.320]  Dabby McDabberson and tweet me from it.
[42:49.320 --> 42:50.520]  It'll be really funny.
[42:50.520 --> 42:51.560]  That shit happens.
[42:51.560 --> 42:52.440]  You guys, I really want to thank you
[42:52.780 --> 42:53.740]  for listening to the podcast.
[42:53.740 --> 42:55.420]  Thanks again to Mike for showing up.
[42:55.420 --> 42:57.660]  I'll be back in another week.
[42:57.660 --> 42:58.880]  You guys, I don't have any sponsors
[42:58.880 --> 43:01.820]  for this month's podcast, or this month for the podcast.
[43:01.820 --> 43:03.940]  If you're interested in sponsoring the show,
[43:03.940 --> 43:06.700]  send me an email to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[43:06.700 --> 43:08.280]  I'll get you all the information that you need.
[43:08.280 --> 43:09.700]  You can sponsor the show.
[43:09.700 --> 43:10.760]  We'll put your product out there.
[43:10.760 --> 43:13.980]  We get over 5,000 listens within 48 hours.
[43:13.980 --> 43:17.580]  So we can hype up your product really well.
[43:17.580 --> 43:18.780]  Now that the show is over, you guys,
[43:18.780 --> 43:20.400]  please go to iTunes.
[43:20.400 --> 43:21.380]  Go to the iTunes store.
[43:21.400 --> 43:22.600]  Search for Grow From Your Heart.
[43:22.600 --> 43:25.040]  Find the review section and give me a five-star rating.
[43:25.040 --> 43:26.320]  Please.
[43:26.320 --> 43:28.400]  You know we're worth five stars.
[43:28.400 --> 43:29.240]  We deserve it.
[43:29.240 --> 43:30.400]  We deserve a thumbs up.
[43:30.400 --> 43:31.240]  After that, type a little comment.
[43:31.240 --> 43:32.840]  One of us worked really hard for this, y'all.
[43:32.840 --> 43:34.440]  Yeah, I bought a lot of toys.
[43:34.440 --> 43:35.520]  Sounds good.
[43:35.520 --> 43:36.360]  Type in a comment.
[43:36.360 --> 43:37.240]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[43:37.240 --> 43:40.440]  I'll read your comments on a future episode, you guys.
[43:40.440 --> 43:42.360]  I already said to follow me on all the social media.
[43:42.360 --> 43:43.880]  Don't forget that the show is available
[43:43.880 --> 43:45.440]  on iTunes and Stitcher,
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.040]  and every single episode is always and forever
[43:49.180 --> 43:52.140]  archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[43:52.140 --> 43:52.980]  That'll never go away.
[43:52.980 --> 43:54.220]  I do apologize that the website
[43:54.220 --> 43:56.420]  has not been updated in quite a while.
[43:56.420 --> 43:58.520]  My web guy has been occupied with school,
[43:58.520 --> 43:59.820]  so we're just gonna let him do that.
[43:59.820 --> 44:00.900]  When he gets out of school,
[44:00.900 --> 44:02.020]  then he'll fix up the website.
[44:02.020 --> 44:02.860]  School first.
[44:02.860 --> 44:03.980]  I'm not gonna distract him.
[44:03.980 --> 44:05.660]  We're all about edumacation here.
[44:06.700 --> 44:08.340]  I did say edumacation.
[44:08.340 --> 44:09.580]  What else do we got?
[44:09.580 --> 44:11.460]  I think that's all we got for the show.
[44:11.460 --> 44:13.940]  So until next time, I need to give a huge, huge shout out
[44:13.940 --> 44:16.780]  to my ninja, Spence, in the entire Garden of Weedon crew.
[44:16.780 --> 44:18.300]  A big shout out to my new rig.
[44:18.320 --> 44:19.880]  She has been named Juanita.
[44:19.880 --> 44:21.640]  Thanks for joining the family, Juanita.
[44:21.640 --> 44:23.040]  She's a cute little Toro rig.
[44:23.040 --> 44:23.880]  She's beautiful.
[44:23.880 --> 44:25.200]  She hits like a champ.
[44:25.200 --> 44:26.940]  She looks really good with the e-mail on her.
[44:26.940 --> 44:28.080]  Mike, you're quiet about that.
[44:28.080 --> 44:30.160]  You looked at it and looked away like,
[44:30.160 --> 44:31.500]  that bitch done hurt me.
[44:31.500 --> 44:33.800]  No, I like her.
[44:33.800 --> 44:36.720]  And that furniture table she's sitting on is sick.
[44:36.720 --> 44:39.200]  Oh, we should, God, we should shout out furniture
[44:39.200 --> 44:40.040]  while we're here.
[44:40.040 --> 44:40.860]  Shout out to furniture.
[44:40.860 --> 44:41.700]  We didn't do any shout outs.
[44:41.700 --> 44:42.900]  So big shout out to furniture.
[44:42.900 --> 44:44.560]  Check out BigCartel.
[44:44.560 --> 44:47.160]  Or it's furniture.bigcartel.com.
[44:47.260 --> 44:49.980]  Or go to bigcartel.com, search for furniture,
[44:49.980 --> 44:50.840]  and look what they're making.
[44:50.840 --> 44:52.020]  They're making coffee tables.
[44:52.020 --> 44:53.260]  They're making shelves.
[44:53.260 --> 44:54.420]  They're making tables.
[44:54.420 --> 44:55.880]  They're making all kinds of random shit
[44:55.880 --> 44:58.020]  that you can think of with the fucking e-mail
[44:58.020 --> 44:58.960]  built into it, you guys.
[44:58.960 --> 45:00.860]  You can have an e-mail built into some random shit.
[45:00.860 --> 45:03.000]  That one just made a weird twinkling noise.
[45:03.000 --> 45:04.060]  I hope that was your phone.
[45:04.060 --> 45:04.900]  It was.
[45:04.900 --> 45:06.580]  All right, that's cooler than the e-mail doing it,
[45:06.580 --> 45:08.960]  because that wasn't a feature that I knew about.
[45:08.960 --> 45:11.140]  Your new rig does not have digital alerts, bro.
[45:11.140 --> 45:12.500]  That was pretty cool.
[45:12.500 --> 45:13.800]  All right, you guys, we're getting out of here.
[45:13.800 --> 45:14.780]  Shout out to my ninja, Spence.
[45:14.780 --> 45:15.860]  Thanks again for listening.
[45:15.880 --> 45:17.640]  Huge shout out to my homie Mike for coming over.
[45:17.640 --> 45:19.800]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[45:19.800 --> 45:21.360]  and give your mom a hug for me.
