[00:01.340 --> 00:03.340]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:03.340 --> 00:21.090]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:21.090 --> 00:22.090]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:22.090 --> 00:23.090]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:23.090 --> 00:25.090]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:25.090 --> 00:26.090]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:26.090 --> 00:28.090]  or even someone who is just curious
[00:28.090 --> 00:30.090]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:30.090 --> 00:33.090]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:33.090 --> 00:35.090]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:35.090 --> 00:37.090]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:37.090 --> 00:39.090]  As always, I need to send a huge shout out
[00:39.090 --> 00:41.090]  to my friends at the GrowFromYourHeart podcast.
[00:41.090 --> 00:42.090]  They're the best podcast.
[00:42.090 --> 00:43.090]  Thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.090 --> 00:45.090]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.090 --> 00:47.090]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.090 --> 00:49.090]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.090 --> 00:53.090]  Big shout out to Cash, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.090 --> 00:56.090]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:56.090 --> 00:58.090]  it is a beautiful day today in Pueblo, Colorado.
[00:58.090 --> 01:00.090]  I'm sure you've heard me complain about things
[01:00.090 --> 01:02.090]  like negative 17 degrees,
[01:02.090 --> 01:05.090]  and we've had a couple of days that were four and five degrees,
[01:05.090 --> 01:09.090]  but today, it was 75 degrees outside,
[01:09.090 --> 01:10.090]  and it was beautiful.
[01:10.090 --> 01:11.090]  There were lovely ladies out there
[01:11.090 --> 01:13.090]  running around in short shorts.
[01:13.090 --> 01:15.090]  There were obnoxious dudes out there
[01:15.090 --> 01:16.090]  zipping around on motorcycles.
[01:16.090 --> 01:20.090]  It was a great day, and spring is in the air.
[01:20.090 --> 01:22.090]  But you know what comes with spring, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:22.090 --> 01:24.090]  Insects come with spring.
[01:24.090 --> 01:26.090]  So this episode is going to be about
[01:26.090 --> 01:31.090]  how to prevent, identify, and correct common garden issues.
[01:31.090 --> 01:33.090]  This will probably be the start of a series
[01:33.090 --> 01:38.090]  on identifying, preventing, and correcting garden issues.
[01:39.090 --> 01:41.090]  Now, before we get to identifying your garden problems,
[01:41.090 --> 01:44.090]  I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Handmade Apparel.
[01:44.090 --> 01:45.090]  That's right.
[01:45.090 --> 01:46.090]  If you need T-shirts printed,
[01:46.090 --> 01:47.090]  if you need hoodies printed,
[01:47.090 --> 01:49.090]  if you need stickers made,
[01:49.090 --> 01:52.090]  if you need hat pins designed and printed,
[01:53.090 --> 01:55.090]  my friends at HandmadeApparel.biz can help you out.
[01:55.090 --> 01:56.090]  That's right.
[01:56.090 --> 01:59.090]  HandmadeApparel.biz, they make my iReed Genetics T-shirts.
[01:59.090 --> 02:01.090]  They make the Grow From Your Heart podcast hoodies.
[02:01.090 --> 02:04.090]  They've printed all of my hat pins.
[02:04.090 --> 02:05.090]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:05.090 --> 02:08.090]  I can't recommend anyone better than Handmade Apparel.
[02:08.090 --> 02:09.090]  Check them out, HandmadeApparel.biz,
[02:09.090 --> 02:11.090]  and let them know Rasta Jeff sent you,
[02:11.090 --> 02:14.090]  and let them know you're listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:16.090 --> 02:19.090]  You guys, last week I did an episode about mixing your nutrients
[02:19.090 --> 02:21.090]  and properly watering your plants,
[02:21.090 --> 02:23.090]  and I may have overlooked a couple of things
[02:23.090 --> 02:26.090]  that I want to throw into this episode.
[02:26.090 --> 02:30.090]  I admit that I am not a very experienced hydro grower.
[02:30.090 --> 02:32.090]  I have not done a lot of hydroponic growing.
[02:33.090 --> 02:34.090]  When you're growing hydro,
[02:34.090 --> 02:36.090]  if you are mixing up a reservoir,
[02:36.090 --> 02:38.090]  and you are putting nutrients in there,
[02:38.090 --> 02:40.090]  and you start running that for a few days,
[02:40.090 --> 02:42.090]  some of the water may evaporate.
[02:42.090 --> 02:44.090]  You may need to top that off.
[02:44.090 --> 02:46.090]  I would check daily.
[02:46.090 --> 02:49.090]  Get in there and check to make sure the water has not gone too low.
[02:49.090 --> 02:52.090]  While you're in there checking, check the pH.
[02:52.090 --> 02:54.090]  The pH may need to be adjusted.
[02:54.090 --> 02:57.090]  So, on a daily basis, go in there and check your hydro tank.
[02:57.090 --> 02:59.090]  If you're using deep water culture,
[02:59.090 --> 03:00.090]  if you're using an ebb and flow,
[03:00.090 --> 03:02.090]  if you're using a drain table,
[03:02.090 --> 03:03.090]  however you're doing it,
[03:03.090 --> 03:06.090]  make sure there's enough water in your reservoir,
[03:06.090 --> 03:09.090]  and make sure that the pH hasn't changed too dramatically.
[03:09.090 --> 03:11.090]  And if it has, fix it.
[03:11.090 --> 03:14.090]  Now, you may need to add a little water to that.
[03:14.090 --> 03:16.090]  When you add the water, make sure your PPMs are correct.
[03:16.090 --> 03:18.090]  If your PPMs go too low,
[03:18.090 --> 03:20.090]  you may need to add a little bit of nutrients.
[03:20.090 --> 03:22.090]  Be careful when you do this,
[03:22.090 --> 03:25.090]  because in hydro it is easy to burn your plants.
[03:25.090 --> 03:26.090]  So, something I overlooked,
[03:26.090 --> 03:28.090]  that you may need to add water,
[03:28.090 --> 03:30.090]  and that when you do that, adjust your pH,
[03:30.090 --> 03:33.090]  and also check your PPMs.
[03:33.090 --> 03:35.090]  Something else I need to mention about hydro.
[03:35.090 --> 03:40.090]  It is a good idea to remix your nutrients
[03:40.090 --> 03:42.090]  approximately every seven to ten days.
[03:42.090 --> 03:43.090]  Drain that water out of there,
[03:43.090 --> 03:45.090]  put fresh water in there.
[03:45.090 --> 03:46.090]  If you're using reverse osmosis water,
[03:46.090 --> 03:48.090]  if you're using tap water,
[03:48.090 --> 03:49.090]  whatever kind of water you're using,
[03:49.090 --> 03:52.090]  clean it out, refill it, redo your nutrient program,
[03:52.090 --> 03:55.090]  reset the PPMs, reset the pH,
[03:55.090 --> 03:57.090]  and get everything started for a fresh week.
[03:57.090 --> 03:59.090]  This is actually a really good idea,
[03:59.090 --> 04:01.090]  because your plants want a different diet
[04:01.090 --> 04:04.090]  approximately every seven to ten days anyway.
[04:04.090 --> 04:05.090]  Through different phases of growth,
[04:05.090 --> 04:07.090]  they're going to require different things.
[04:07.090 --> 04:09.090]  You don't feed your plants the exact same stuff
[04:09.090 --> 04:10.090]  all the way through veg,
[04:10.090 --> 04:12.090]  and you definitely don't feed them the same thing
[04:12.090 --> 04:14.090]  all the way through bloom.
[04:14.090 --> 04:16.090]  So, it's a good idea to change the mix
[04:16.090 --> 04:18.090]  every seven to ten days anyway.
[04:18.090 --> 04:20.090]  And every time you're in there doing anything with the water,
[04:20.090 --> 04:22.090]  make sure you check the pH.
[04:22.090 --> 04:24.090]  It's always a good idea, you can't go wrong.
[04:24.090 --> 04:26.090]  So, I apologize for missing that,
[04:26.090 --> 04:27.090]  in the last episode,
[04:27.090 --> 04:29.090]  but here it is for you now,
[04:29.090 --> 04:30.090]  I hope I'm helping you out.
[04:30.090 --> 04:32.090]  Also, I don't know if I mentioned this,
[04:32.090 --> 04:34.090]  but I was mixing up nutrients for my own garden.
[04:34.090 --> 04:36.090]  Yes, I do use bottled nutrients.
[04:36.090 --> 04:38.090]  I was actually trying to lower the pH of a solution.
[04:38.090 --> 04:40.090]  My pH was a little bit too high,
[04:40.090 --> 04:42.090]  and instead of using pH down or anything,
[04:42.090 --> 04:45.090]  I used liquid karma from Botanicare,
[04:45.090 --> 04:46.090]  and it worked very well.
[04:46.090 --> 04:47.090]  It dropped my pH right to where I needed it,
[04:47.090 --> 04:49.090]  and I didn't have to use a whole lot,
[04:49.090 --> 04:51.090]  and I think that that is actually a useful product.
[04:51.090 --> 04:52.090]  So, I was able to lower the pH,
[04:52.090 --> 04:54.090]  and add something useful to my mix.
[04:55.090 --> 04:56.090]  So, my point is,
[04:56.090 --> 04:57.090]  shake the shit out of your nutrients.
[04:57.090 --> 04:59.090]  Get that bottle and just shake it vigorously
[04:59.090 --> 05:00.090]  for a couple of seconds.
[05:00.090 --> 05:01.090]  Just,
[05:01.090 --> 05:02.090]  you want to stir it up,
[05:02.090 --> 05:04.090]  you want to get everything that's settled on the bottom,
[05:04.090 --> 05:06.090]  mixed back into the mix.
[05:06.090 --> 05:08.090]  You want to get all the stuff stirred up in there.
[05:08.090 --> 05:11.090]  You don't want to end up with the last bit of that bottle
[05:11.090 --> 05:12.090]  having all the potency in it,
[05:12.090 --> 05:14.090]  and then you end up burning your nutrients,
[05:14.090 --> 05:15.090]  or your plants.
[05:15.090 --> 05:17.090]  So, shake the shit out of your bottles
[05:17.090 --> 05:18.090]  before you use them.
[05:18.090 --> 05:20.090]  That is my guidance.
[05:20.090 --> 05:22.090]  Also, I feel like it's a good idea
[05:22.090 --> 05:24.090]  that once you've mixed up nutrients for your potted plants,
[05:24.090 --> 05:28.090]  it is a good idea to use that mix within 24 hours.
[05:28.090 --> 05:30.090]  It's not a good idea to let that stuff sit around.
[05:30.090 --> 05:32.090]  Someone's going to argue me and say,
[05:32.090 --> 05:33.090]  but what about hydro?
[05:33.090 --> 05:35.090]  You're mixing that up and running it for seven days.
[05:35.090 --> 05:37.090]  Yes, it is running.
[05:37.090 --> 05:38.090]  It's moving constantly.
[05:38.090 --> 05:39.090]  It's got oxygen added to it,
[05:39.090 --> 05:41.090]  and it's not sitting still.
[05:41.090 --> 05:42.090]  It's constantly moving.
[05:42.090 --> 05:44.090]  If you mix up a big tank of water,
[05:44.090 --> 05:46.090]  and just let it sit there with nutrients in it,
[05:46.090 --> 05:47.090]  it's going to settle.
[05:47.090 --> 05:48.090]  It's going to get funky.
[05:48.090 --> 05:50.090]  Those products are sold in different bottles,
[05:50.090 --> 05:52.090]  because they're supposed to be kept separate
[05:52.090 --> 05:53.090]  until you're using them.
[05:53.090 --> 05:56.090]  So, don't mix this stuff up too far in advance.
[05:56.090 --> 05:58.090]  Try to use it within 24 hours,
[05:58.090 --> 06:00.090]  and I think it will be more effective.
[06:00.090 --> 06:02.090]  There's no need to brew the synthetic nutrients.
[06:02.090 --> 06:04.090]  We heard that from our friends at Dragonfly Earth Medicine
[06:04.090 --> 06:06.090]  in the last episode.
[06:06.090 --> 06:08.090]  So, just mix it up right before you're going to use it.
[06:08.090 --> 06:10.090]  If you don't use it within 24 to 36 hours,
[06:10.090 --> 06:12.090]  you'll start seeing it get funky.
[06:12.090 --> 06:14.090]  If it starts kind of changing colors,
[06:14.090 --> 06:16.090]  kind of starting to stink real bad,
[06:16.090 --> 06:17.090]  just dump it out.
[06:17.090 --> 06:19.090]  Make a fresh mix.
[06:19.090 --> 06:21.090]  Alright, I feel like I got myself caught up
[06:21.090 --> 06:23.090]  on the stuff I missed last week,
[06:23.090 --> 06:25.090]  and I got through a six minute intro,
[06:25.090 --> 06:26.090]  so I'm going to press pause for a second.
[06:26.090 --> 06:28.090]  I'm going to take a gigantic dab,
[06:28.090 --> 06:29.090]  and when I get back,
[06:29.090 --> 06:31.090]  we're going to talk about identifying,
[06:31.090 --> 06:33.090]  preventing, and correcting
[06:33.090 --> 06:36.090]  common issues in your ganja garden.
[06:37.090 --> 06:38.090]  Alright, you guys, I am back,
[06:38.090 --> 06:40.090]  and I am well medicated.
[06:40.090 --> 06:43.090]  I just took a couple of fat dabs of Cascade Shatter.
[06:43.090 --> 06:46.090]  Cascade is Lemon Skunk, cross to Daybreaker.
[06:46.090 --> 06:47.090]  I bred that one.
[06:47.090 --> 06:48.090]  I grew the flowers,
[06:48.090 --> 06:50.090]  and then our friend, the Barefoot Grower,
[06:50.090 --> 06:51.090]  did the extraction for us.
[06:51.090 --> 06:53.090]  Great work, my friend.
[06:53.090 --> 06:56.090]  This hash always makes me go completely stupid
[06:56.090 --> 06:58.090]  for a couple of seconds when I smoke it.
[06:58.090 --> 06:59.090]  I completely love it.
[06:59.090 --> 07:00.090]  Good work.
[07:00.090 --> 07:01.090]  Alright, let's get back on track.
[07:01.090 --> 07:03.090]  We are talking about insects.
[07:03.090 --> 07:06.090]  You guys, the insects are getting bad here in Colorado
[07:06.090 --> 07:08.090]  because there are so many commercial gardens.
[07:08.090 --> 07:10.090]  There are gardens everywhere,
[07:10.090 --> 07:13.090]  and a lot of people here in Colorado
[07:13.090 --> 07:14.090]  grow cannabis at home.
[07:14.090 --> 07:16.090]  It is legal to grow cannabis in your home,
[07:16.090 --> 07:19.090]  and I think that everybody should exercise that right.
[07:19.090 --> 07:21.090]  A lot of people are growing cannabis at home.
[07:21.090 --> 07:25.090]  A lot of people work in a commercial cultivation facility.
[07:25.090 --> 07:27.090]  A lot of those people are taking bugs
[07:27.090 --> 07:30.090]  from their home grow to the commercial grow.
[07:30.090 --> 07:32.090]  Then their employees and coworkers
[07:32.090 --> 07:34.090]  are picking up those bugs on their clothes
[07:34.090 --> 07:37.090]  and taking them to their personal grow.
[07:37.090 --> 07:39.090]  Then their friends are coming to their house
[07:39.090 --> 07:40.090]  and sitting next to them,
[07:40.090 --> 07:42.090]  and the spider mites are climbing across the couch
[07:42.090 --> 07:45.090]  onto your buddy's T-shirt because he smells like weed too,
[07:45.090 --> 07:48.090]  and then your buddy's going home and going in his garden
[07:48.090 --> 07:50.090]  and putting the spider mites in his garden.
[07:50.090 --> 07:52.090]  The bugs are just being moved around
[07:52.090 --> 07:54.090]  like STDs here in Colorado.
[07:54.090 --> 07:56.090]  They're just everywhere.
[07:56.090 --> 07:58.090]  Everybody works in the industry,
[07:58.090 --> 08:01.090]  so the bugs have no problem getting passed around,
[08:01.090 --> 08:04.090]  which means everybody here that is paying attention
[08:04.090 --> 08:06.090]  needs to be very diligent
[08:06.090 --> 08:09.090]  about their pest management programs.
[08:09.090 --> 08:12.090]  It's very easy to prevent getting pests,
[08:12.090 --> 08:13.090]  but once you've got pests,
[08:13.090 --> 08:16.090]  it is a huge pain in the ass getting rid of them.
[08:16.090 --> 08:19.090]  I've seen people shut down entire gardens
[08:19.090 --> 08:21.090]  because they cannot get rid of spider mites,
[08:21.090 --> 08:24.090]  and it just takes one or two mites to start the party,
[08:24.090 --> 08:26.090]  and it can get ugly really quickly.
[08:26.090 --> 08:29.090]  There's actually a commercial grow in Pueblo that gave up.
[08:29.090 --> 08:30.090]  They're just like, fuck it.
[08:30.090 --> 08:32.090]  We can't get rid of our mite issue.
[08:32.090 --> 08:34.090]  They cut down all of their plants.
[08:34.090 --> 08:35.090]  They closed their facility.
[08:35.090 --> 08:37.090]  The facility is now for sale.
[08:37.090 --> 08:40.090]  Whoever buys that place is going to have to go in there
[08:40.090 --> 08:42.090]  and clean the shit out of it
[08:42.090 --> 08:44.090]  before they're able to grow in there.
[08:44.090 --> 08:48.090]  Let's work our way into talking about identifying,
[08:48.090 --> 08:51.090]  preventing, and correcting some common issues
[08:51.090 --> 08:53.090]  with our ganja plants.
[08:53.090 --> 08:56.090]  Of course, I've got a disclaimer.
[08:56.090 --> 08:59.090]  How you treat your garden is up to you.
[08:59.090 --> 09:01.090]  If you want to use harsh chemicals
[09:01.090 --> 09:03.090]  and harmful pesticides in your garden,
[09:03.090 --> 09:05.090]  that is your decision.
[09:05.090 --> 09:07.090]  If you want to go a more organic route,
[09:07.090 --> 09:09.090]  that is your decision.
[09:09.090 --> 09:11.090]  Just please take some time to read
[09:11.090 --> 09:13.090]  about what you are applying to your crops
[09:13.090 --> 09:16.090]  and read what it can do to people that consume that.
[09:16.090 --> 09:19.090]  Also, if you are applying pesticides outside,
[09:19.090 --> 09:22.090]  please be much more aware of what you're doing.
[09:22.090 --> 09:24.090]  Please try to use organic ingredients.
[09:24.090 --> 09:28.090]  Keep in mind that you are affecting my environment also.
[09:28.090 --> 09:30.090]  You're affecting my child's environment,
[09:30.090 --> 09:32.090]  your child's environment.
[09:32.090 --> 09:33.090]  It's not just yours.
[09:33.090 --> 09:35.090]  You're spraying everybody's environment.
[09:35.090 --> 09:37.090]  Yes, those are your cannabis plants.
[09:37.090 --> 09:38.090]  Yes, that is your property,
[09:38.090 --> 09:41.090]  but who knows what you're doing to the overall environment.
[09:41.090 --> 09:44.090]  The insects that travel from your property to mine
[09:44.090 --> 09:45.090]  don't know any barriers.
[09:45.090 --> 09:47.090]  They don't know any boundaries.
[09:47.090 --> 09:48.090]  Whatever you're doing over there
[09:48.090 --> 09:50.090]  is going to have some sort of an effect
[09:50.090 --> 09:51.090]  on what's going on over here,
[09:51.090 --> 09:53.090]  no matter how far apart we are.
[09:53.090 --> 09:56.090]  Please be aware of what you're putting on your garden,
[09:56.090 --> 09:58.090]  what you're spraying, what you're applying.
[09:58.090 --> 10:01.090]  Even if you are releasing beneficial insects,
[10:01.090 --> 10:05.090]  please think about it, read about it, be aware.
[10:05.090 --> 10:06.090]  That's all I want you to do.
[10:06.090 --> 10:08.090]  Just be aware of what you're doing.
[10:08.090 --> 10:09.090]  All right, one more thing
[10:09.090 --> 10:12.090]  before I get into talking about these insects.
[10:12.090 --> 10:13.090]  I started this podcast
[10:13.090 --> 10:15.090]  because there was another podcast
[10:15.090 --> 10:18.090]  that every time somebody asked a question,
[10:18.090 --> 10:21.090]  the host of the podcast would pitch products.
[10:21.090 --> 10:22.090]  He would read an email
[10:22.090 --> 10:24.090]  and talk about an issue in somebody's garden,
[10:24.090 --> 10:27.090]  and then he would talk about a very specific product
[10:27.090 --> 10:28.090]  that would cure your problem.
[10:28.090 --> 10:30.090]  He would tell you where to get it.
[10:30.090 --> 10:31.090]  He would give you a coupon code
[10:31.090 --> 10:33.090]  to get a deal on that product,
[10:33.090 --> 10:34.090]  and it felt very dirty.
[10:34.090 --> 10:36.090]  It did not feel like the host of that show
[10:36.090 --> 10:39.090]  was trying to improve my garden.
[10:39.090 --> 10:41.090]  It felt like he was trying to make money
[10:41.090 --> 10:44.090]  by doing a deal with a pesticide company,
[10:44.090 --> 10:45.090]  and that's not what I'm here for.
[10:45.090 --> 10:46.090]  I will mention products,
[10:46.090 --> 10:49.090]  but I am not paid by any of those companies
[10:49.090 --> 10:50.090]  to sell any products to you.
[10:50.090 --> 10:52.090]  There are products that I know will work.
[10:52.090 --> 10:54.090]  There are products that I use and have used
[10:54.090 --> 10:56.090]  and have experience with.
[10:56.090 --> 10:57.090]  It's the only reason I'm mentioning them
[10:57.090 --> 10:59.090]  is because they work for me,
[10:59.090 --> 11:01.090]  and I think they will work for you.
[11:01.090 --> 11:02.090]  I'm not here to sell you anything.
[11:02.090 --> 11:05.090]  I'm not paid by any pesticide, fungicide.
[11:05.090 --> 11:08.090]  I'm not paid by any grow company at all.
[11:08.090 --> 11:11.090]  I actually think that a better plan
[11:11.090 --> 11:12.090]  instead of buying a product
[11:12.090 --> 11:13.090]  and just spraying a product
[11:13.090 --> 11:16.090]  would be to find the cause of your problem,
[11:16.090 --> 11:17.090]  correct that cause,
[11:17.090 --> 11:19.090]  then eradicate the problem,
[11:19.090 --> 11:22.090]  and then you know that it will never come back.
[11:22.090 --> 11:23.090]  If you simply say,
[11:23.090 --> 11:24.090]  I've got spider mites,
[11:24.090 --> 11:25.090]  and you walk in and you spray a product
[11:25.090 --> 11:27.090]  and you kill all the spider mites,
[11:27.090 --> 11:28.090]  good job.
[11:28.090 --> 11:29.090]  They're dead temporarily,
[11:29.090 --> 11:31.090]  but they're still coming in from somewhere,
[11:31.090 --> 11:32.090]  and you're going to get the same damn problem
[11:32.090 --> 11:33.090]  all over again.
[11:33.090 --> 11:35.090]  So I'm going to talk more about
[11:35.090 --> 11:36.090]  how to prevent and correct issues
[11:36.090 --> 11:39.090]  instead of what to buy to solve your problem.
[11:39.090 --> 11:40.090]  All right.
[11:40.090 --> 11:41.090]  With that being said,
[11:41.090 --> 11:44.090]  let's talk a little bit about spider mites.
[11:44.090 --> 11:47.090]  Spider mites are probably the most common problem
[11:47.090 --> 11:49.090]  and pest in most ganja grows,
[11:49.090 --> 11:51.090]  and especially in most commercial grows.
[11:51.090 --> 11:52.090]  I would say it's a toss-up
[11:52.090 --> 11:54.090]  between powdery mildew and spider mites
[11:54.090 --> 11:56.090]  in Colorado commercial grows.
[11:56.090 --> 11:58.090]  Every grower either has had
[11:58.090 --> 12:00.090]  or will get spider mites at some point.
[12:00.090 --> 12:02.090]  It's something you're going to have to deal with
[12:02.090 --> 12:03.090]  as a cannabis grower.
[12:03.090 --> 12:05.090]  They're very common.
[12:05.090 --> 12:08.090]  There are over 1,000 different species of spider mites,
[12:08.090 --> 12:10.090]  but when you get mites on your cannabis,
[12:10.090 --> 12:13.090]  you are probably going to get the two-spotted mite.
[12:13.090 --> 12:15.090]  That is the most common mite for your cannabis plants.
[12:15.090 --> 12:18.090]  You may run into a mite known as the russet mite.
[12:18.090 --> 12:20.090]  That mite is a bitch.
[12:20.090 --> 12:22.090]  It is way harder to get rid of.
[12:22.090 --> 12:23.090]  It's way harder to control.
[12:23.090 --> 12:24.090]  So hopefully you don't run into those.
[12:24.090 --> 12:26.090]  Hopefully you just get the two-spotted mite.
[12:26.090 --> 12:27.090]  Today, we're going to talk about
[12:27.090 --> 12:28.090]  the two-spotted spider mite.
[12:28.090 --> 12:30.090]  Let's start with talking about
[12:30.090 --> 12:33.090]  how to identify a mite problem.
[12:33.090 --> 12:35.090]  Spider mites give us plenty of warnings
[12:35.090 --> 12:36.090]  and indications that they are there.
[12:36.090 --> 12:38.090]  They're easy to identify
[12:38.090 --> 12:39.090]  once they start showing you they're there.
[12:39.090 --> 12:41.090]  Sometimes you'll notice the tops of your leaves
[12:41.090 --> 12:43.090]  look like they have been stippled.
[12:43.090 --> 12:45.090]  It looks like somebody has just been poking it
[12:45.090 --> 12:47.090]  with a needle and changing the color.
[12:47.090 --> 12:49.090]  That is a spider mite on the bottom of that leaf
[12:49.090 --> 12:51.090]  sticking his little fangs in there,
[12:51.090 --> 12:52.090]  sucking the juice out of your plants.
[12:52.090 --> 12:54.090]  Your plants will get stippling.
[12:54.090 --> 12:55.090]  It just looks like you've been poking at it.
[12:55.090 --> 12:56.090]  Poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke,
[12:56.090 --> 12:57.090]  poke, poke, poke, poke, poke, poke,
[12:57.090 --> 12:58.090]  and it's just got little marks on it.
[12:58.090 --> 13:02.090]  That is the first indicator of a spider mite infestation.
[13:02.090 --> 13:05.090]  The second sign may be webbing.
[13:05.090 --> 13:07.090]  If the top of your buds start getting little webs on there,
[13:07.090 --> 13:09.090]  they start to build like a teepee.
[13:09.090 --> 13:10.090]  It just looks like a little cone
[13:10.090 --> 13:11.090]  around the top of your buds.
[13:11.090 --> 13:12.090]  If you've got that on there,
[13:12.090 --> 13:15.090]  you have got a serious spider mite infestation.
[13:15.090 --> 13:17.090]  That is a huge indicator that they are there,
[13:17.090 --> 13:20.090]  they're loving life, they're comfortable,
[13:20.090 --> 13:21.090]  they're getting everything they need,
[13:21.090 --> 13:23.090]  and you're going to have to fight to get rid of them.
[13:23.090 --> 13:25.090]  Another way to tell that you've got spider mites
[13:25.090 --> 13:28.090]  is you may see spider mites on the bottom of the leaves.
[13:28.090 --> 13:31.090]  On the underside of your leaf is where spider mites will live.
[13:31.090 --> 13:33.090]  They will be crawling around right there.
[13:33.090 --> 13:35.090]  That's also where they lay their eggs.
[13:35.090 --> 13:37.090]  The mites and the eggs may be visible
[13:37.090 --> 13:38.090]  if they're there enough.
[13:38.090 --> 13:39.090]  You may need to get a magnifier
[13:39.090 --> 13:40.090]  if you don't have a lot of them,
[13:40.090 --> 13:42.090]  a 60 to 100x magnifier,
[13:42.090 --> 13:44.090]  and just put that on the bottom side of your leaf
[13:44.090 --> 13:45.090]  and watch for something to move.
[13:45.090 --> 13:46.090]  You'll see them climbing around,
[13:46.090 --> 13:47.090]  just little round things.
[13:47.090 --> 13:48.090]  They're ugly as shit.
[13:48.090 --> 13:50.090]  They look like little monsters.
[13:50.090 --> 13:51.090]  Those are spider mites.
[13:51.090 --> 13:52.090]  You need to get rid of them.
[13:52.090 --> 13:54.090]  Those eggs I was talking about,
[13:54.090 --> 13:57.090]  spider mites are crazy fast breeders.
[13:57.090 --> 13:59.090]  When they have babies,
[13:59.090 --> 14:00.090]  something fucked up about spider mites,
[14:00.090 --> 14:03.090]  they have a three to one ratio of females to males.
[14:03.090 --> 14:05.090]  That means when four spider mites are born,
[14:05.090 --> 14:06.090]  three of them are girls,
[14:06.090 --> 14:08.090]  which means they're going to reproduce.
[14:08.090 --> 14:10.090]  When spider mites reproduce,
[14:10.090 --> 14:12.090]  they lay up to 200 eggs at a time,
[14:12.090 --> 14:16.090]  and they can repeat that cycle as often as every eight days
[14:16.090 --> 14:17.090]  if they have the right conditions.
[14:17.090 --> 14:18.090]  And guess what?
[14:18.090 --> 14:20.090]  Your grow room is the perfect condition.
[14:20.090 --> 14:22.090]  There's nothing in there disrupting them.
[14:22.090 --> 14:23.090]  You've got the perfect temperature.
[14:23.090 --> 14:24.090]  You've got beautiful humidity.
[14:24.090 --> 14:27.090]  You've got the perfect environment for spider mites.
[14:27.090 --> 14:29.090]  So what we need to do is prevent spider mites
[14:29.090 --> 14:31.090]  from getting into the room.
[14:31.090 --> 14:32.090]  And if we see spider mites,
[14:32.090 --> 14:34.090]  we need to know how to eradicate them.
[14:34.090 --> 14:37.090]  So let's first talk about preventing spider mites.
[14:37.090 --> 14:39.090]  Building a well-sealed grow room
[14:39.090 --> 14:42.090]  is a great way to keep spider mites out.
[14:42.090 --> 14:44.090]  Go to Hello's or Home Depot
[14:44.090 --> 14:46.090]  and get some of that expanding foam insulation
[14:46.090 --> 14:49.090]  and spray that in every crack in your wall.
[14:49.090 --> 14:51.090]  That way nothing can climb through those holes.
[14:51.090 --> 14:52.090]  Spider mites are tiny.
[14:52.090 --> 14:54.090]  They're going to come through every crack,
[14:54.090 --> 14:55.090]  every nook, every cranny,
[14:55.090 --> 14:57.090]  and they are going to get in your garden.
[14:57.090 --> 14:58.090]  So put up some Panda film,
[14:58.090 --> 15:01.090]  use a bunch of tape, seal off that grow room
[15:01.090 --> 15:04.090]  so that you have way less entrance routes
[15:04.090 --> 15:05.090]  for spider mites to come in.
[15:05.090 --> 15:07.090]  They're going to come in from the outside.
[15:07.090 --> 15:09.090]  They're also going to come in on your clothes,
[15:09.090 --> 15:12.090]  or they're going to come in on an infested plant
[15:12.090 --> 15:14.090]  or through your ventilation system.
[15:14.090 --> 15:16.090]  So what you need to do
[15:16.090 --> 15:19.090]  is any time you get a new clone from anybody,
[15:19.090 --> 15:20.090]  if it comes from a friend,
[15:20.090 --> 15:21.090]  if it comes from a dispensary,
[15:21.090 --> 15:23.090]  if it comes from some dude on Craigslist,
[15:23.090 --> 15:25.090]  wherever you take that plant,
[15:25.090 --> 15:26.090]  before you put it in your garden,
[15:26.090 --> 15:28.090]  make sure it is treated properly
[15:28.090 --> 15:31.090]  for bugs and mildew.
[15:31.090 --> 15:33.090]  You might want to trust your friends.
[15:33.090 --> 15:35.090]  You might think you can trust the dispensary.
[15:35.090 --> 15:37.090]  You think you can trust that guy off of Craigslist,
[15:37.090 --> 15:40.090]  but you have no idea what they might not know.
[15:40.090 --> 15:41.090]  They could have spider mites.
[15:41.090 --> 15:42.090]  They could have aphids.
[15:42.090 --> 15:43.090]  They could have thrips.
[15:43.090 --> 15:44.090]  They could have fungus gnats.
[15:44.090 --> 15:45.090]  They could have powdery mildew,
[15:45.090 --> 15:46.090]  and they don't even know it,
[15:46.090 --> 15:48.090]  and they just passed it on to you.
[15:48.090 --> 15:49.090]  You just gave them money for a clone,
[15:49.090 --> 15:51.090]  and you actually just paid for spider mites.
[15:51.090 --> 15:53.090]  You got a free collection of spider mites
[15:53.090 --> 15:54.090]  with your new clone.
[15:54.090 --> 15:56.090]  That shit happens.
[15:56.090 --> 15:57.090]  So be careful.
[15:57.090 --> 15:58.090]  Whenever you get a new clone,
[15:58.090 --> 16:00.090]  take it to wherever you're taking it,
[16:00.090 --> 16:01.090]  your growth facility, your home,
[16:01.090 --> 16:03.090]  your trap house, your whatever.
[16:03.090 --> 16:04.090]  Take it there.
[16:04.090 --> 16:05.090]  Don't put it in with the rest of your plants.
[16:05.090 --> 16:07.090]  Take it to a quarantined area
[16:07.090 --> 16:09.090]  and spray the shit out of it with some products,
[16:09.090 --> 16:12.090]  so that way you can make sure there are no mites on it
[16:12.090 --> 16:14.090]  before you put it in your garden.
[16:14.090 --> 16:16.090]  Pyrethrum is a great product for spider mites,
[16:16.090 --> 16:17.090]  although some spider mites
[16:17.090 --> 16:19.090]  will develop a resistance and an immunity to it.
[16:19.090 --> 16:22.090]  It should work for most of your mite problems.
[16:22.090 --> 16:24.090]  Evergreen Pyrethrum is the brand I would recommend.
[16:24.090 --> 16:25.090]  It's affordable.
[16:25.090 --> 16:28.090]  Also, you can use a product called Smite.
[16:28.090 --> 16:31.090]  Smite is a natural product made of mostly plant oils,
[16:31.090 --> 16:35.090]  and it is actually allowed and approved by the MED.
[16:35.090 --> 16:36.090]  Both of the products I just listed
[16:36.090 --> 16:39.090]  are allowed and approved in Colorado production facilities,
[16:39.090 --> 16:41.090]  so they have been deemed safe
[16:41.090 --> 16:43.090]  by the Colorado Department of Agriculture
[16:43.090 --> 16:46.090]  for cannabis plants that will be consumed
[16:46.090 --> 16:48.090]  by humans as a medical product.
[16:48.090 --> 16:50.090]  So these two products are deemed safe
[16:50.090 --> 16:52.090]  by the Department of Agriculture.
[16:52.090 --> 16:54.090]  You guys, I would not use them if they were not deemed safe.
[16:54.090 --> 16:56.090]  I would remove them from my personal grows,
[16:56.090 --> 16:57.090]  and they would have to be removed
[16:57.090 --> 16:59.090]  from any commercial grow I am a part of.
[16:59.090 --> 17:02.090]  So Evergreen Pyrethrum and Smite
[17:02.090 --> 17:03.090]  for plants that are coming in.
[17:03.090 --> 17:05.090]  Also, if you are an Azimax user,
[17:05.090 --> 17:07.090]  Azimax is a perfect thing for plants that are coming in.
[17:07.090 --> 17:09.090]  Just make sure you treat the clones that are coming in
[17:09.090 --> 17:11.090]  with some sort of miticide.
[17:11.090 --> 17:14.090]  Whatever level of toxicity you want to use is up to you.
[17:14.090 --> 17:16.090]  If you want to go gentle, I'd recommend the Smite.
[17:16.090 --> 17:19.090]  If you want to use something a little stronger,
[17:19.090 --> 17:20.090]  maybe Azimax.
[17:20.090 --> 17:22.090]  If you want to go real strong and get crazy with it
[17:22.090 --> 17:24.090]  and make sure nothing ever lives in your garden,
[17:24.090 --> 17:26.090]  go ahead and hit it with Floramite.
[17:26.090 --> 17:27.090]  I can't endorse Floramite.
[17:27.090 --> 17:29.090]  It's a little bit of a potent product,
[17:29.090 --> 17:30.090]  and it's actually banned
[17:30.090 --> 17:32.090]  by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[17:32.090 --> 17:35.090]  You cannot use Floramite in a commercial grow,
[17:35.090 --> 17:37.090]  so you have to consider that.
[17:37.090 --> 17:38.090]  It's available.
[17:38.090 --> 17:39.090]  You can get it online if you want it.
[17:39.090 --> 17:41.090]  Whatever products you choose to use,
[17:41.090 --> 17:43.090]  please go to that product's website
[17:43.090 --> 17:46.090]  and read the proper application technique
[17:46.090 --> 17:47.090]  and methods for that product.
[17:47.090 --> 17:48.090]  You may think,
[17:48.090 --> 17:49.090]  what, I just mix it up with water,
[17:49.090 --> 17:50.090]  put it in a sprayer,
[17:50.090 --> 17:52.090]  and fucking spray it on the plants, right?
[17:52.090 --> 17:53.090]  Maybe.
[17:53.090 --> 17:54.090]  There may be some other steps.
[17:54.090 --> 17:56.090]  Floramite needs to be pH adjusted.
[17:56.090 --> 17:58.090]  Floramite needs to be added to water
[17:58.090 --> 17:59.090]  at a very specific temperature.
[17:59.090 --> 18:02.090]  There are a couple of extra ingredients for Azimax
[18:02.090 --> 18:03.090]  that you've probably never read
[18:03.090 --> 18:04.090]  and aren't even aware of.
[18:04.090 --> 18:07.090]  Also, make sure you wear the appropriate clothing
[18:07.090 --> 18:09.090]  and protective equipment.
[18:09.090 --> 18:11.090]  Personal protective equipment is very important
[18:11.090 --> 18:12.090]  when you're applying pesticides.
[18:12.090 --> 18:16.090]  You are applying something that is very concentrated.
[18:16.090 --> 18:17.090]  You are moving it from the bottle
[18:17.090 --> 18:18.090]  where it's concentrated
[18:18.090 --> 18:19.090]  and diluting it with the water.
[18:19.090 --> 18:21.090]  At that concentrated point,
[18:21.090 --> 18:23.090]  it is very dangerous and it is very potent.
[18:23.090 --> 18:25.090]  Wear something to protect your eyes.
[18:25.090 --> 18:27.090]  Those nerdy looking Science Lab goggles,
[18:27.090 --> 18:28.090]  get a pair of those.
[18:28.090 --> 18:29.090]  Wear them.
[18:29.090 --> 18:31.090]  Nobody's gonna laugh at you.
[18:31.090 --> 18:34.090]  Also, protect your hands.
[18:34.090 --> 18:35.090]  Wear gloves.
[18:35.090 --> 18:36.090]  Go to the grocery store.
[18:36.090 --> 18:38.090]  Go somewhere and get some of those black nitrile gloves.
[18:38.090 --> 18:40.090]  Protect your skin and hands.
[18:40.090 --> 18:42.090]  When you're spraying, wear long sleeves.
[18:42.090 --> 18:44.090]  Wear a respirator.
[18:44.090 --> 18:46.090]  Always wear long pants and shoes
[18:46.090 --> 18:47.090]  when you're applying pesticides.
[18:47.090 --> 18:49.090]  Cover yourself up.
[18:49.090 --> 18:52.090]  You want to eradicate pests, not yourself.
[18:52.090 --> 18:53.090]  Alright, I feel like that's enough about
[18:53.090 --> 18:55.090]  treating clones that are coming in
[18:55.090 --> 18:57.090]  to not bring spider mites on your new plants.
[18:57.090 --> 19:00.090]  Also, don't drag spider mites around
[19:00.090 --> 19:02.090]  from your friend's garden to your garden
[19:02.090 --> 19:03.090]  or from the commercial girl where you work
[19:03.090 --> 19:06.090]  to your personal garden or vice versa.
[19:06.090 --> 19:09.090]  Change clothes when traveling from one garden to the other.
[19:09.090 --> 19:10.090]  Try to change your clothes.
[19:10.090 --> 19:11.090]  Try to change your shoes.
[19:11.090 --> 19:14.090]  Try to dedicate specific shoes to your garden.
[19:14.090 --> 19:16.090]  I've got grow shoes and normal shoes.
[19:16.090 --> 19:17.090]  I don't wear the same shoes in the garden
[19:17.090 --> 19:18.090]  that I wear at home.
[19:18.090 --> 19:20.090]  I don't wear those shoes out and about.
[19:20.090 --> 19:22.090]  I try to be as careful as I can
[19:22.090 --> 19:24.090]  because I'm in different gardens all the time.
[19:24.090 --> 19:26.090]  Alright, another thing we should talk about
[19:26.090 --> 19:30.090]  is some sort of a filtration on your ventilation system.
[19:30.090 --> 19:32.090]  You've got fresh air coming into the grow room.
[19:32.090 --> 19:34.090]  You need filtration on there,
[19:34.090 --> 19:36.090]  especially if the air is coming from outdoors.
[19:36.090 --> 19:38.090]  If you're bringing in air from outside,
[19:38.090 --> 19:40.090]  it definitely needs to be filtered.
[19:40.090 --> 19:41.090]  You don't want to bring in,
[19:41.090 --> 19:43.090]  maybe one of your neighbors has a male plant outside.
[19:43.090 --> 19:44.090]  You don't want to bring in pollen.
[19:44.090 --> 19:45.090]  You don't want to bring in insects,
[19:45.090 --> 19:47.090]  and you don't want to bring in mold and mildew
[19:47.090 --> 19:50.090]  and whatever else you could possibly bring in from outside.
[19:50.090 --> 19:51.090]  Don't invite problems.
[19:51.090 --> 19:53.090]  If you're bringing air in from outdoors,
[19:53.090 --> 19:55.090]  run it through a HIPAA filter first
[19:55.090 --> 19:58.090]  or get yourself one of those Shroom Cloud filters.
[19:58.090 --> 20:00.090]  It just goes on the ducting,
[20:00.090 --> 20:01.090]  and it makes sure that nothing can pass through.
[20:01.090 --> 20:02.090]  It's got a HIPAA filter,
[20:02.090 --> 20:04.090]  and everything gets caught as it comes in.
[20:04.090 --> 20:07.090]  Also, if you're bringing air from one room
[20:07.090 --> 20:09.090]  to another, just put those little,
[20:09.090 --> 20:12.090]  you can buy sheets of HIPAA filters at the hardware store,
[20:12.090 --> 20:14.090]  and you can cut them to the size that you need them.
[20:14.090 --> 20:16.090]  Put a strip of duct tape around the edges
[20:16.090 --> 20:18.090]  to where you make a little frame,
[20:18.090 --> 20:19.090]  and then just duct tape that shit
[20:19.090 --> 20:23.090]  or staple gun that shit right around all of your ducting,
[20:23.090 --> 20:24.090]  any in and out.
[20:24.090 --> 20:25.090]  Just duct both sides.
[20:25.090 --> 20:26.090]  Put a piece on both sides.
[20:26.090 --> 20:28.090]  It's not going to slow down the air too much,
[20:28.090 --> 20:30.090]  but it will stop bugs from moving around.
[20:30.090 --> 20:33.090]  We've got to stop spider mites from moving from room to room,
[20:33.090 --> 20:35.090]  and we have to control them a little bit.
[20:35.090 --> 20:39.090]  Put some HIPAA filters and some Shroom Cloud covers
[20:39.090 --> 20:41.090]  over all of your intakes and outtakes
[20:41.090 --> 20:42.090]  and all of your holes.
[20:42.090 --> 20:44.090]  That would help you a lot.
[20:44.090 --> 20:46.090]  One more thing you can do to try to prevent
[20:46.090 --> 20:47.090]  getting spider mites in your grow room
[20:47.090 --> 20:49.090]  is if you've got pets, if you've got a dog,
[20:49.090 --> 20:51.090]  if you've got a cat,
[20:51.090 --> 20:53.090]  I would recommend keeping that pet away from the grow.
[20:53.090 --> 20:54.090]  I know that sounds weird.
[20:54.090 --> 20:56.090]  A lot of people like to have their dog in the grow with them.
[20:56.090 --> 20:57.090]  That's their buddy.
[20:57.090 --> 20:59.090]  I think your dog's probably got bugs on it.
[20:59.090 --> 21:00.090]  Don't bring him in there.
[21:00.090 --> 21:02.090]  You can't wash your dog every time you come in there.
[21:02.090 --> 21:03.090]  He's been out rolling in the dirt.
[21:03.090 --> 21:04.090]  He's been out playing in the grass.
[21:04.090 --> 21:05.090]  Who knows where he's been?
[21:05.090 --> 21:07.090]  The fucking dog's out running around in the yard,
[21:07.090 --> 21:09.090]  chewing shit up, shitting on stuff,
[21:09.090 --> 21:10.090]  getting spider mites on him.
[21:10.090 --> 21:11.090]  Don't let him in your garden.
[21:11.090 --> 21:12.090]  That's my opinion.
[21:12.090 --> 21:15.090]  All right, we have talked about spider mite identification.
[21:15.090 --> 21:17.090]  We have talked about preventation.
[21:17.090 --> 21:19.090]  Prevention? I said preventation.
[21:19.090 --> 21:20.090]  I'm not even going to edit it,
[21:20.090 --> 21:21.090]  because that was fucking awesome.
[21:21.090 --> 21:22.090]  I said it like I meant it.
[21:22.090 --> 21:24.090]  We've talked about preventation.
[21:24.090 --> 21:26.090]  That's my new word, you guys.
[21:26.090 --> 21:28.090]  Somebody put that on Wikipedia and in a dictionary for me.
[21:28.090 --> 21:30.090]  Give me credit. Preventation.
[21:30.090 --> 21:32.090]  I didn't write down preventation.
[21:32.090 --> 21:33.090]  It says prevention.
[21:33.090 --> 21:34.090]  I had to look, because I was like,
[21:34.090 --> 21:36.090]  if I wrote down preventation,
[21:36.090 --> 21:37.090]  that's when I've got a problem.
[21:37.090 --> 21:40.090]  We've talked about identification and prevention.
[21:40.090 --> 21:42.090]  Now let's talk about eradification.
[21:42.090 --> 21:45.090]  To eradicate spider mites,
[21:45.090 --> 21:47.090]  there are several ways to go about
[21:47.090 --> 21:48.090]  getting rid of your spider mite problem.
[21:48.090 --> 21:51.090]  It kind of depends on what stage of growth your plants are in.
[21:51.090 --> 21:52.090]  If you're in the veg stage,
[21:52.090 --> 21:54.090]  it's going to be a simple solution.
[21:54.090 --> 21:55.090]  If you are in flower,
[21:55.090 --> 21:57.090]  it's going to take a little bit of consideration.
[21:57.090 --> 22:01.090]  Also, you need to decide if you want to go organically,
[22:01.090 --> 22:03.090]  if you want to use beneficial insects,
[22:03.090 --> 22:05.090]  or if you want to use harsh chemicals
[22:05.090 --> 22:07.090]  so that you can be sure everything is gone in one application.
[22:07.090 --> 22:09.090]  It kind of depends on what your goal is.
[22:09.090 --> 22:13.090]  Of course, I recommend mostly organic products.
[22:13.090 --> 22:15.090]  Then once you get later into flower,
[22:15.090 --> 22:18.090]  I would recommend the beneficial insects and predatory mites.
[22:18.090 --> 22:23.090]  Let's talk about things you can apply to your crop in veg
[22:23.090 --> 22:26.090]  to get rid of spider mites if you do see them.
[22:26.090 --> 22:29.090]  One thing you can do that works immediately,
[22:29.090 --> 22:31.090]  you can pull off a leaf that is infested with mites.
[22:31.090 --> 22:32.090]  You can just grab the entire leaf,
[22:32.090 --> 22:33.090]  yank it right off the plant.
[22:33.090 --> 22:35.090]  Now it's not even part of the plant.
[22:35.090 --> 22:36.090]  Put that in a trash bag,
[22:36.090 --> 22:38.090]  seal that trash bag up,
[22:38.090 --> 22:39.090]  remove that from the grow,
[22:39.090 --> 22:40.090]  and throw it away.
[22:40.090 --> 22:42.090]  You've just taken care of those mites.
[22:42.090 --> 22:44.090]  There are probably more mites somewhere,
[22:44.090 --> 22:46.090]  but at least you've gotten rid of that little colony,
[22:46.090 --> 22:47.090]  that whole leaf worth of spider mites.
[22:47.090 --> 22:49.090]  Don't be afraid to defoliate.
[22:49.090 --> 22:52.090]  You can do this from day one all the way up to harvest.
[22:52.090 --> 22:54.090]  You can just pull off leaves.
[22:54.090 --> 22:56.090]  It won't do much damage to the plant
[22:56.090 --> 22:58.090]  if you leave enough leaf for the plant to survive.
[22:58.090 --> 22:59.090]  Don't be afraid.
[22:59.090 --> 23:00.090]  Just go in there and defoliate.
[23:00.090 --> 23:02.090]  This applies to powdery mildew also.
[23:02.090 --> 23:04.090]  Feel free to just pull off those infected leaves.
[23:04.090 --> 23:07.090]  So defoliation is your very first step.
[23:07.090 --> 23:10.090]  It's free, it's simple, and it works.
[23:10.090 --> 23:11.090]  Your next step,
[23:11.090 --> 23:14.090]  you can think about what you may want to spray onto the plant.
[23:14.090 --> 23:16.090]  You can apply things like we talked about earlier.
[23:16.090 --> 23:18.090]  You can use the pyrethrum spray.
[23:18.090 --> 23:19.090]  You can use Smite.
[23:19.090 --> 23:21.090]  You can use Azimax.
[23:21.090 --> 23:23.090]  There are a thousand products in between that you can use.
[23:23.090 --> 23:25.090]  Mighty Wash works.
[23:25.090 --> 23:27.090]  There are a whole bunch of other products.
[23:27.090 --> 23:28.090]  Read what works for you.
[23:28.090 --> 23:30.090]  Read about what you want to do
[23:30.090 --> 23:32.090]  if spraying is the way you'd like to go about it.
[23:32.090 --> 23:34.090]  If you feel like you want to spray
[23:34.090 --> 23:37.090]  but you aren't interested in using a commercially made
[23:37.090 --> 23:40.090]  synthetic pesticide or an organic pesticide,
[23:40.090 --> 23:42.090]  you can make your own worm compost tea,
[23:42.090 --> 23:44.090]  and you can make all kinds of teas
[23:44.090 --> 23:46.090]  and apply those to the plants.
[23:46.090 --> 23:49.090]  Those beneficial bacteria that come with those teas
[23:49.090 --> 23:51.090]  may run off your spider mites.
[23:51.090 --> 23:52.090]  I cannot guarantee it,
[23:52.090 --> 23:54.090]  but I know it's a possibility
[23:54.090 --> 23:56.090]  if you use the right products in your tea.
[23:56.090 --> 23:58.090]  That's not something I am completely experienced with,
[23:58.090 --> 23:59.090]  but as I'm talking about it,
[23:59.090 --> 24:01.090]  I'm sure that Sean and Will and Frosty
[24:01.090 --> 24:02.090]  would all be yelling at me,
[24:02.090 --> 24:03.090]  and they'd be saying,
[24:03.090 --> 24:04.090]  bro, just make a fucking tea
[24:04.090 --> 24:06.090]  and spray it on those fucking plants,
[24:06.090 --> 24:07.090]  and they'll be just fine.
[24:07.090 --> 24:09.090]  That way you don't have to use any pesticides.
[24:09.090 --> 24:10.090]  Think about a tea.
[24:10.090 --> 24:11.090]  A tea would probably work for you
[24:11.090 --> 24:14.090]  to control a spider mite infestation.
[24:14.090 --> 24:16.090]  I don't know that it would completely eradicate it.
[24:16.090 --> 24:18.090]  Since we're talking about teas,
[24:18.090 --> 24:20.090]  put a little neem or carangameal in that tea.
[24:20.090 --> 24:22.090]  That's going to knock out your spider mites.
[24:22.090 --> 24:24.090]  We're going to talk about botanical oils
[24:24.090 --> 24:27.090]  and stuff like neem after I talk about this part.
[24:27.090 --> 24:28.090]  In flower.
[24:28.090 --> 24:29.090]  Once you're in flower,
[24:29.090 --> 24:31.090]  you don't want to spray things onto your plants
[24:31.090 --> 24:33.090]  because it's going to fuck up your buds.
[24:33.090 --> 24:35.090]  It's going to make your buds taste terrible.
[24:35.090 --> 24:36.090]  It's going to stay on your buds.
[24:36.090 --> 24:38.090]  When you're in flower,
[24:38.090 --> 24:40.090]  you're going to need to consider
[24:40.090 --> 24:41.090]  how far into flower you are,
[24:41.090 --> 24:43.090]  how far away from harvest you are,
[24:43.090 --> 24:44.090]  how dense those buds are.
[24:44.090 --> 24:45.090]  You need to think about
[24:45.090 --> 24:46.090]  when you apply this pesticide,
[24:46.090 --> 24:49.090]  is it still going to be there when I harvest?
[24:49.090 --> 24:50.090]  Is it going to leave residuals?
[24:50.090 --> 24:52.090]  Is it going to make my buds
[24:52.090 --> 24:53.090]  and or concentrates taste funny?
[24:53.090 --> 24:55.090]  That's stuff you need to think about.
[24:55.090 --> 24:58.090]  Is it harmful to humans if they do consume it?
[24:58.090 --> 25:00.090]  Those are all things you need to think about.
[25:00.090 --> 25:01.090]  Early in flower,
[25:01.090 --> 25:03.090]  you might be able to get away with spraying.
[25:03.090 --> 25:04.090]  After week three,
[25:04.090 --> 25:07.090]  I would not even consider spraying something on my plants.
[25:07.090 --> 25:09.090]  Well, I may spray some fungus tea
[25:09.090 --> 25:11.090]  and some push on the plants after week three.
[25:11.090 --> 25:14.090]  I like to use push one time at the start of week four,
[25:14.090 --> 25:15.090]  but that's just me.
[25:15.090 --> 25:18.090]  Keep in mind that everything you spray on these plants
[25:18.090 --> 25:20.090]  is going to end up in your concentrate.
[25:20.090 --> 25:21.090]  If you plan on making hash,
[25:21.090 --> 25:23.090]  I would not recommend using neem oil
[25:23.090 --> 25:26.090]  or other essential oils or botanical oils
[25:26.090 --> 25:28.090]  because your hash and your concentrates
[25:28.090 --> 25:30.090]  will taste like those oils.
[25:30.090 --> 25:33.090]  I just talked about not spraying your plants
[25:33.090 --> 25:34.090]  and you've still got spider mites.
[25:34.090 --> 25:36.090]  You're like, what the fuck am I going to do?
[25:36.090 --> 25:37.090]  I've still got an option for you.
[25:37.090 --> 25:40.090]  This is where beneficial insects come in.
[25:40.090 --> 25:43.090]  You can use beneficial insects from the very beginning.
[25:43.090 --> 25:44.090]  You can use them in veg.
[25:44.090 --> 25:46.090]  You can use them as preventative.
[25:46.090 --> 25:48.090]  You can order them online.
[25:48.090 --> 25:49.090]  I would actually recommend,
[25:49.090 --> 25:50.090]  I've got this catalog in my hand right here.
[25:50.090 --> 25:52.090]  I'm turning to the front page.
[25:52.090 --> 25:55.090]  This company is called Arbico Organics,
[25:55.090 --> 25:57.090]  A-R-B-I-C-O Organics.
[25:57.090 --> 25:59.090]  They do not pay me at all.
[25:59.090 --> 26:01.090]  I just really enjoy this catalog.
[26:01.090 --> 26:03.090]  This catalog comes every couple of months.
[26:03.090 --> 26:05.090]  The very first page has a,
[26:05.090 --> 26:08.090]  what is IPM little lesson here.
[26:08.090 --> 26:09.090]  It's just a one page on
[26:09.090 --> 26:11.090]  what is integrated pest management.
[26:11.090 --> 26:13.090]  I may actually turn this little leaflet page
[26:13.090 --> 26:15.090]  into an entire episode in the future
[26:15.090 --> 26:16.090]  because it is very useful.
[26:16.090 --> 26:18.090]  But this magazine, and once again,
[26:18.090 --> 26:19.090]  they don't pay me, you guys.
[26:19.090 --> 26:20.090]  I'm sorry, this sounds like a fucking ad,
[26:20.090 --> 26:21.090]  but it's genuine.
[26:21.090 --> 26:22.090]  In this magazine,
[26:22.090 --> 26:24.090]  I've just opened it up to a couple of pages.
[26:24.090 --> 26:25.090]  Right now, you can order ladybugs.
[26:25.090 --> 26:27.090]  You can order praying mantis.
[26:27.090 --> 26:28.090]  You can order green lacewigs.
[26:28.090 --> 26:29.090]  You can order assassin bugs.
[26:29.090 --> 26:31.090]  You can order minute pirate bugs.
[26:31.090 --> 26:34.090]  There are aphid parasites, aphid predators.
[26:34.090 --> 26:36.090]  But here's where I'm headed.
[26:36.090 --> 26:39.090]  In this magazine, you can order predatory mites.
[26:39.090 --> 26:44.090]  There are spider mites that do not eat cannabis plants,
[26:44.090 --> 26:46.090]  but they do eat other spider mites.
[26:46.090 --> 26:47.090]  So you order these.
[26:47.090 --> 26:48.090]  They come in little packages.
[26:48.090 --> 26:49.090]  They come in a variety of different ways.
[26:49.090 --> 26:51.090]  I've seen them delivered in different ways.
[26:51.090 --> 26:53.090]  Other companies do them other ways.
[26:53.090 --> 26:56.090]  The way I'm most familiar with, and I like the best,
[26:56.090 --> 26:58.090]  they come in things that look like a tea bag,
[26:58.090 --> 26:59.090]  and they have a little hanger on it,
[26:59.090 --> 27:01.090]  and you just hang that from your plants.
[27:01.090 --> 27:03.090]  And the predatory mites will come out
[27:03.090 --> 27:05.090]  when the lights go off, and they'll get hungry,
[27:05.090 --> 27:07.090]  and they'll go running around looking for something to eat.
[27:07.090 --> 27:09.090]  And they're gonna find your spider mite infestation,
[27:09.090 --> 27:10.090]  and there's gonna be a battle.
[27:10.090 --> 27:12.090]  And 90% of the time,
[27:12.090 --> 27:15.090]  these predatory mites are going to win.
[27:15.090 --> 27:16.090]  Like I was saying earlier,
[27:16.090 --> 27:17.090]  you can use predatory mites.
[27:17.090 --> 27:19.090]  You can introduce predatory mites
[27:19.090 --> 27:21.090]  and any other sort of predators into your garden
[27:21.090 --> 27:23.090]  as early as you would like.
[27:23.090 --> 27:26.090]  You can use these year-round indoors.
[27:26.090 --> 27:27.090]  They're great for greenhouses,
[27:27.090 --> 27:30.090]  and honestly, they are ideal for outdoors.
[27:30.090 --> 27:31.090]  They're best for outdoors
[27:31.090 --> 27:32.090]  because they're only going to destroy
[27:32.090 --> 27:35.090]  your damaging spider mites,
[27:35.090 --> 27:36.090]  and they're not gonna mess up your atmosphere,
[27:36.090 --> 27:38.090]  the ecosystem, the agriculture.
[27:38.090 --> 27:40.090]  They're just gonna eat the spider mites,
[27:40.090 --> 27:41.090]  and you won't even notice they're there.
[27:41.090 --> 27:43.090]  So let's talk about some of the predator mites
[27:43.090 --> 27:44.090]  that I would recommend.
[27:44.090 --> 27:45.090]  Right now, I'm working with
[27:45.090 --> 27:47.090]  a commercial cultivation center
[27:47.090 --> 27:48.090]  with a lot of lights.
[27:48.090 --> 27:50.090]  We've got well over 100 lights in there,
[27:50.090 --> 27:53.090]  and their integrated pest management system
[27:53.090 --> 27:55.090]  includes a spider mite called,
[27:55.090 --> 27:56.090]  and I'm gonna mess up the name of this guy,
[27:56.090 --> 27:59.090]  but he is called the Swirsky mite.
[27:59.090 --> 28:02.090]  He is the S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[28:02.090 --> 28:03.090]  I think that's called Swirsky.
[28:03.090 --> 28:05.090]  I've heard it pronounced multiple different ways,
[28:05.090 --> 28:07.090]  but the Swirsky mite is somebody
[28:07.090 --> 28:08.090]  that I release quite frequently
[28:08.090 --> 28:10.090]  in the commercial grow.
[28:10.090 --> 28:12.090]  Also, another predatory mite
[28:12.090 --> 28:13.090]  that we use in the commercial grow
[28:13.090 --> 28:15.090]  is a guy called the Persimilis.
[28:15.090 --> 28:18.090]  He is actually known as Phytosilus persimilis.
[28:18.090 --> 28:19.090]  Don't worry about the names.
[28:19.090 --> 28:21.090]  As long as you see these in the catalog or online,
[28:21.090 --> 28:22.090]  you'll be able to order it.
[28:22.090 --> 28:27.090]  The one you're looking for is spelled P-E-R-S-I-M-I-L-I-S.
[28:27.090 --> 28:28.090]  That's the Persimilis,
[28:28.090 --> 28:32.090]  and the Swirsky, again, was S-W-I-R-S-K-I-I.
[28:32.090 --> 28:34.090]  And then I've got one more predatory mite
[28:34.090 --> 28:36.090]  for you to help you get rid of spider mites,
[28:36.090 --> 28:38.090]  and this guy is known as the Andersoni,
[28:38.090 --> 28:41.090]  A-N-D-E-R-S-O-N-I.
[28:42.090 --> 28:43.090]  All of these guys together
[28:43.090 --> 28:45.090]  will eat up all of your spider mites.
[28:45.090 --> 28:46.090]  They're very affordable.
[28:46.090 --> 28:47.090]  I think it's very effective,
[28:47.090 --> 28:49.090]  and it is very eco-friendly.
[28:49.090 --> 28:51.090]  So order these spider mites.
[28:51.090 --> 28:52.090]  They'll come in the mail.
[28:54.090 --> 28:55.090]  Have it set up to where they come
[28:55.090 --> 28:56.090]  at their scheduled interval
[28:56.090 --> 28:58.090]  so that you remember to apply them
[28:58.090 --> 29:00.090]  to your garden at the right time.
[29:00.090 --> 29:01.090]  So set up a schedule.
[29:01.090 --> 29:02.090]  I think it's like a subscription
[29:02.090 --> 29:03.090]  is what you might call that.
[29:03.090 --> 29:04.090]  Set up your subscription.
[29:04.090 --> 29:05.090]  They will come in the mail.
[29:05.090 --> 29:06.090]  You need to open the box,
[29:06.090 --> 29:08.090]  and then you'll just find however they're shipped.
[29:08.090 --> 29:09.090]  They ship in different ways.
[29:09.090 --> 29:10.090]  Like I said, a lot of them come in little teabags,
[29:10.090 --> 29:12.090]  some of them come in little satchels.
[29:12.090 --> 29:13.090]  Just however they come.
[29:13.090 --> 29:14.090]  I think it's a sachet.
[29:15.090 --> 29:17.090]  Just put those at the bottom of the canopy.
[29:17.090 --> 29:19.090]  Hopefully you lollipopped your plants.
[29:19.090 --> 29:20.090]  You've got some naked legs,
[29:20.090 --> 29:22.090]  and then right where the canopy starts
[29:22.090 --> 29:23.090]  and there's foliage,
[29:23.090 --> 29:26.090]  hang those bug packs right there.
[29:26.090 --> 29:27.090]  If you can afford all three,
[29:27.090 --> 29:29.090]  if you choose to use all three of these spider mites,
[29:29.090 --> 29:32.090]  I would put one of each.
[29:32.090 --> 29:34.090]  Just pick a spot maybe every six or eight feet apart.
[29:34.090 --> 29:36.090]  It depends on how big your garden is.
[29:36.090 --> 29:37.090]  Just pick an interval
[29:37.090 --> 29:39.090]  and just put one of each of these packages
[29:39.090 --> 29:40.090]  in that spot.
[29:40.090 --> 29:42.090]  Your little army of mites will start coming out,
[29:42.090 --> 29:44.090]  and they'll just start finding little food sources,
[29:44.090 --> 29:46.090]  and they'll start eating the shit
[29:46.090 --> 29:47.090]  out of all your bad spider mites,
[29:47.090 --> 29:49.090]  and hopefully they will get rid of them.
[29:49.090 --> 29:51.090]  Here's one thing I need to mention.
[29:51.090 --> 29:53.090]  If you're going to use beneficial insects,
[29:53.090 --> 29:55.090]  you cannot spray pesticides
[29:55.090 --> 29:57.090]  because it will kill your beneficial insects.
[29:57.090 --> 30:01.090]  If you want to mix a spray with beneficial insects,
[30:01.090 --> 30:04.090]  you need to learn what will not kill those insects
[30:04.090 --> 30:06.090]  that you can spray onto your plants.
[30:06.090 --> 30:08.090]  Maybe you're using a swarski mite,
[30:08.090 --> 30:10.090]  and you've got a spray that you can apply to the plants
[30:10.090 --> 30:12.090]  that the mite needs to take a bite out of the plant
[30:12.090 --> 30:15.090]  before it is affected by that pesticide.
[30:15.090 --> 30:17.090]  You would be able to apply that to the plants
[30:17.090 --> 30:20.090]  because the swarski mite is not going to take a bite
[30:20.090 --> 30:21.090]  out of your cannabis plant.
[30:21.090 --> 30:23.090]  It will not hurt your swarski mite.
[30:23.090 --> 30:25.090]  However, if you sprayed smite on the swarskis,
[30:25.090 --> 30:26.090]  it will kill them
[30:26.090 --> 30:29.090]  because it mainly works by suffocating the bugs.
[30:29.090 --> 30:31.090]  You have to think about what you're going to use.
[30:31.090 --> 30:34.090]  Read as much as you can and plan ahead
[30:34.090 --> 30:36.090]  because these insects, they are affordable,
[30:36.090 --> 30:37.090]  but they are not free,
[30:37.090 --> 30:39.090]  and you don't want to buy bugs and release them
[30:39.090 --> 30:40.090]  and then kill them.
[30:40.090 --> 30:42.090]  That seems a little counterproductive to me.
[30:42.090 --> 30:45.090]  Okay, I feel like we have identified spider mites.
[30:45.090 --> 30:48.090]  We have learned how to prevent spider mites,
[30:48.090 --> 30:50.090]  and we have learned how to eradicate them.
[30:50.090 --> 30:51.090]  Once they're gone,
[30:51.090 --> 30:53.090]  you have to think about how you got them,
[30:53.090 --> 30:55.090]  and you have to make sure they don't come back.
[30:55.090 --> 30:57.090]  If they got in through a crack in the wall,
[30:57.090 --> 30:59.090]  if they got in through a clone that you brought,
[30:59.090 --> 31:00.090]  if they got in on your dreadlocks
[31:00.090 --> 31:03.090]  because you've got spider mites at the commercial grow,
[31:03.090 --> 31:05.090]  however it happened, make sure you correct it.
[31:05.090 --> 31:07.090]  Make sure you start doing things to prevent it.
[31:07.090 --> 31:09.090]  If you work in a commercial grow,
[31:09.090 --> 31:10.090]  if you're around other grows,
[31:10.090 --> 31:11.090]  if you're a grow consultant,
[31:11.090 --> 31:13.090]  if you're in the marijuana cannabis industry,
[31:13.090 --> 31:14.090]  wherever you are,
[31:14.090 --> 31:17.090]  you're going to have to take stronger measures than most folks.
[31:17.090 --> 31:20.090]  You may want to start releasing these predator mites
[31:20.090 --> 31:23.090]  in your own garden every two weeks just to do it.
[31:23.090 --> 31:24.090]  You may want to start spraying something
[31:24.090 --> 31:26.090]  at the first and 15th of every month
[31:26.090 --> 31:28.090]  to make sure you don't get an issue.
[31:28.090 --> 31:30.090]  You're going to have to pay attention.
[31:30.090 --> 31:32.090]  And once you do see a sign of spider mites,
[31:32.090 --> 31:34.090]  you cannot put it off until tomorrow
[31:34.090 --> 31:37.090]  because they reproduce more quickly than rabbits.
[31:37.090 --> 31:38.090]  It's fucking ridiculous.
[31:38.090 --> 31:40.090]  You could put it off until tomorrow
[31:40.090 --> 31:41.090]  and then tomorrow those spider mites
[31:41.090 --> 31:43.090]  will have enveloped that entire plant in a web.
[31:43.090 --> 31:45.090]  It'll look like you're growing cotton trees.
[31:45.090 --> 31:46.090]  If you see spider mites,
[31:46.090 --> 31:48.090]  get in there today and deal with them.
[31:48.090 --> 31:50.090]  Okay, don't let the spider mites win.
[31:50.090 --> 31:52.090]  They're getting out of hand.
[31:52.090 --> 31:54.090]  All right, let's move on from spider mites a little bit.
[31:54.090 --> 31:55.090]  You guys have been going for a little while
[31:55.090 --> 31:56.090]  and my throat's starting to burn out
[31:56.090 --> 31:59.090]  and I still want to do one, maybe two more issues.
[31:59.090 --> 32:03.090]  So let's get down to fungus gnats.
[32:03.090 --> 32:05.090]  Fungus gnats are super easy to identify.
[32:05.090 --> 32:08.090]  They're little black flies that fly around your soil.
[32:08.090 --> 32:10.090]  When you water, they probably come flying out.
[32:10.090 --> 32:12.090]  If you walk up to the plant and just tap the root ball
[32:12.090 --> 32:14.090]  and tap the soil or tap the pot,
[32:14.090 --> 32:15.090]  they'll probably come flying out of there.
[32:15.090 --> 32:17.090]  They're probably all over your grow by now.
[32:17.090 --> 32:19.090]  You see them, they're fucking annoying.
[32:19.090 --> 32:21.090]  They are very easy to identify.
[32:21.090 --> 32:25.090]  Fungus gnats are also very easy to prevent and get rid of.
[32:25.090 --> 32:28.090]  One very helpful way to prevent from getting fungus gnats
[32:28.090 --> 32:31.090]  is to keep your soil dry at the top.
[32:31.090 --> 32:33.090]  Fungus gnats like a nice moist area.
[32:33.090 --> 32:35.090]  So if you let that top layer of the soil dry out,
[32:35.090 --> 32:37.090]  they won't want to come around.
[32:37.090 --> 32:39.090]  Another good way to prevent fungus gnats
[32:39.090 --> 32:42.090]  that seems really easy, but some people might overlook
[32:42.090 --> 32:43.090]  is a screen.
[32:43.090 --> 32:44.090]  Put a screen on every window.
[32:44.090 --> 32:47.090]  Also, those HEPA filters we were talking about for spider mites,
[32:47.090 --> 32:50.090]  all of that stuff is applicable for a fungus gnat.
[32:50.090 --> 32:51.090]  They're little flying insects.
[32:51.090 --> 32:52.090]  They're super tiny.
[32:52.090 --> 32:53.090]  They can get in any crack.
[32:53.090 --> 32:54.090]  They can come through any window.
[32:54.090 --> 32:56.090]  They want to come to the moisture.
[32:56.090 --> 32:57.090]  They want to come land on your soil.
[32:57.090 --> 33:00.090]  They breed in the top layer of soil and then they fly away.
[33:00.090 --> 33:02.090]  Their only purpose is to breed and reproduce.
[33:02.090 --> 33:06.090]  Fungus gnats don't have any other purpose except to reproduce.
[33:06.090 --> 33:08.090]  All right, so we've put up a screen.
[33:08.090 --> 33:11.090]  We've gotten rid of any excess moisture in the top layer of our soil.
[33:11.090 --> 33:14.090]  Now, we have prevented fungus gnats from coming around.
[33:14.090 --> 33:17.090]  The next couple things I'm going to talk about can work as prevention,
[33:17.090 --> 33:20.090]  and they can also work as ways to eradicate the fungus gnats.
[33:20.090 --> 33:23.090]  If you want to use these products before the fungus gnats get there,
[33:23.090 --> 33:24.090]  you can do that.
[33:24.090 --> 33:26.090]  Or if you want to wait until you already have them,
[33:26.090 --> 33:27.090]  that's also an option.
[33:27.090 --> 33:28.090]  Something that is very affordable,
[33:28.090 --> 33:30.090]  if you have a small personal garden,
[33:30.090 --> 33:33.090]  I like to use what are known as mosquito dunks.
[33:33.090 --> 33:34.090]  They sell them at every hardware store.
[33:34.090 --> 33:35.090]  They sell them at Big R.
[33:35.090 --> 33:36.090]  They sell them at Lowe's.
[33:36.090 --> 33:37.090]  They sell them at Home Depot.
[33:37.090 --> 33:41.090]  They're little round, donut-looking, cookie-looking things
[33:41.090 --> 33:45.090]  that are used to drop into a pond or standing water
[33:45.090 --> 33:48.090]  to keep mosquitoes from gathering around that water.
[33:48.090 --> 33:52.090]  The way that I like to use them to get rid of or prevent fungus gnats
[33:52.090 --> 33:54.090]  is I will fill my reservoir with water.
[33:54.090 --> 33:56.090]  I will mix my nutrients just like normal.
[33:56.090 --> 33:58.090]  Then I just drop the mosquito dunk right in there,
[33:58.090 --> 34:00.090]  let it soften up for a little bit,
[34:00.090 --> 34:03.090]  and then I wear rubber gloves and just grind it up into a small powder
[34:03.090 --> 34:05.090]  to where it just dissolves into the water.
[34:05.090 --> 34:06.090]  Then as I'm watering the plants,
[34:06.090 --> 34:11.090]  I push it to the side and make sure to get a little bit for every plant.
[34:11.090 --> 34:14.090]  A little bit of that stuff that I can see goes into each plant.
[34:14.090 --> 34:16.090]  I would assume that the smaller stuff that broke up that I can't see
[34:16.090 --> 34:18.090]  is getting even more distributed,
[34:18.090 --> 34:20.090]  but I like that there's some that I can see
[34:20.090 --> 34:23.090]  so I can judge a little bit of how much I'm putting per plant.
[34:23.090 --> 34:25.090]  The mosquito dunks are very affordable.
[34:25.090 --> 34:28.090]  They're available at most of your local hardware stores or your feed stores,
[34:28.090 --> 34:30.090]  or if you've got a ranch store or something around you,
[34:30.090 --> 34:32.090]  they've probably got them there.
[34:32.090 --> 34:34.090]  There's another product known as Natrol.
[34:34.090 --> 34:37.090]  Natrol is the same ingredient as the mosquito dunks,
[34:37.090 --> 34:39.090]  but it is much more concentrated,
[34:39.090 --> 34:41.090]  and it will definitely work for you.
[34:41.090 --> 34:43.090]  You can also use the evergreen pyrethrum.
[34:43.090 --> 34:45.090]  That will work as a drench.
[34:45.090 --> 34:47.090]  I don't remember the dilution rate.
[34:47.090 --> 34:48.090]  Read the bottle.
[34:48.090 --> 34:50.090]  It will tell you how much evergreen to put per gallon of water.
[34:50.090 --> 34:52.090]  Apply that to your soil as a drench,
[34:52.090 --> 34:54.090]  and that will remove your fungus gnats.
[34:54.090 --> 34:56.090]  You can also use a product called Grandivo.
[34:56.090 --> 34:58.090]  Grandivo will work for you.
[34:58.090 --> 35:01.090]  If you use the evergreen and the Grandivo together,
[35:01.090 --> 35:05.090]  you will get rid of your fungus gnats forever in two applications.
[35:05.090 --> 35:07.090]  If you want to be preventative
[35:07.090 --> 35:10.090]  and you don't want to use a beneficial bacteria or a spray pesticide,
[35:10.090 --> 35:12.090]  you can use diatomaceous earth.
[35:12.090 --> 35:15.090]  Diatomaceous earth has little sharp points on it.
[35:15.090 --> 35:17.090]  It's a little rough texture.
[35:17.090 --> 35:19.090]  It's like little rocks.
[35:19.090 --> 35:22.090]  It's like really sharp Rice Krispies or something like that.
[35:22.090 --> 35:25.090]  Apply a layer of that to the top of your soil.
[35:25.090 --> 35:27.090]  Cover the soil completely.
[35:27.090 --> 35:30.090]  Then the bugs can't climb in and out of there because it cuts them up.
[35:30.090 --> 35:32.090]  It kills them when they try to get in and out.
[35:32.090 --> 35:34.090]  They don't want anything to do with that.
[35:34.090 --> 35:36.090]  One hint, wait for the soil to dry mostly,
[35:36.090 --> 35:38.090]  and then apply the diatomaceous earth onto there.
[35:38.090 --> 35:41.090]  Let it sit as long as you can before you water.
[35:41.090 --> 35:44.090]  Another thing you can use to keep these fungus gnats away
[35:44.090 --> 35:46.090]  is a product called Spinosad.
[35:46.090 --> 35:49.090]  There are a lot of products that contain Spinosad.
[35:49.090 --> 35:51.090]  Monterey Garden Spray does contain Spinosad.
[35:51.090 --> 35:53.090]  You can spray that on the leaves.
[35:53.090 --> 35:55.090]  You can do a soil drench with it.
[35:55.090 --> 35:57.090]  Actually, here's something that I should mention.
[35:57.090 --> 35:59.090]  If you are going to use the evergreen pyrethrums
[35:59.090 --> 36:01.090]  or the Spinosad as a soil drench,
[36:01.090 --> 36:03.090]  you should also spray the foliage
[36:03.090 --> 36:06.090]  because those fungus gnats are going to fly out of the soil there,
[36:06.090 --> 36:08.090]  and they're going to land on the leaves and just chill out there
[36:08.090 --> 36:10.090]  and start living there for a little while.
[36:10.090 --> 36:12.090]  If you're going to do a soil drench,
[36:12.090 --> 36:15.090]  also do a foliar application of whichever product you choose,
[36:15.090 --> 36:17.090]  if it's the evergreen pyrethrums
[36:17.090 --> 36:20.090]  or if it's the Spinosad from Monterey Garden Spray.
[36:20.090 --> 36:23.090]  Let's talk about one more thing with fungus gnats.
[36:23.090 --> 36:24.090]  You knew this was coming.
[36:24.090 --> 36:27.090]  The 100% organic way to get rid of your fungus gnats
[36:27.090 --> 36:29.090]  would be fungus gnat predators.
[36:29.090 --> 36:31.090]  I'm going to try to read you the name out of this catalog,
[36:31.090 --> 36:33.090]  but it is a lot of letters.
[36:33.090 --> 36:36.090]  It looks like it would read hypoaspis miles to me.
[36:36.090 --> 36:39.090]  The hypoaspis miles fungus gnat predator,
[36:39.090 --> 36:43.090]  I'll spell it for you, H-Y-P-O-A-S-P-I-S,
[36:43.090 --> 36:48.090]  and then the word miles, hypoaspis miles fungus gnat predator,
[36:48.090 --> 36:51.090]  those would be the beneficial insects I would recommend
[36:51.090 --> 36:55.090]  to control and eradicate your fungus gnat infestation.
[36:55.090 --> 36:58.090]  All right, you guys, I feel like that pretty much covers
[36:58.090 --> 37:01.090]  spider mites and fungus gnats.
[37:01.090 --> 37:03.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, at the top of the show,
[37:03.090 --> 37:05.090]  I know I said I was going to try to cover three topics.
[37:05.090 --> 37:07.090]  I know I said I was going to try to get to whiteflies,
[37:07.090 --> 37:08.090]  but I've been gone for a long time,
[37:08.090 --> 37:10.090]  and honestly, my throat's getting a little bit tired,
[37:10.090 --> 37:11.090]  and instead of faking it
[37:11.090 --> 37:13.090]  and just phoning in the last half of this episode,
[37:13.090 --> 37:15.090]  I'm going to make whiteflies
[37:15.090 --> 37:18.090]  the first issue we deal with on the part two
[37:18.090 --> 37:22.090]  of how to identify, prevent, and correct common garden issues,
[37:22.090 --> 37:23.090]  so please stay tuned for that one.
[37:23.090 --> 37:25.090]  It'll be coming up very soon.
[37:25.090 --> 37:27.090]  I appreciate you for listening to this.
[37:27.090 --> 37:29.090]  I hope you learned a whole bunch
[37:29.090 --> 37:31.090]  about spider mites and fungus gnats.
[37:31.090 --> 37:33.090]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the part of the podcast
[37:33.090 --> 37:35.090]  where I tell you all about Patreon.
[37:35.090 --> 37:37.090]  Patreon is a service where you can sign up
[37:37.090 --> 37:40.090]  to financially contribute to the podcast.
[37:40.090 --> 37:42.090]  You can make a donation for the podcast.
[37:42.090 --> 37:44.090]  If you feel like this podcast was worth a dollar or two,
[37:44.090 --> 37:46.090]  if you feel like you learned something,
[37:46.090 --> 37:47.090]  or if I helped you improve your garden
[37:47.090 --> 37:49.090]  and you would like to contribute to the show,
[37:49.090 --> 37:51.090]  what you can do is go to patreon.com
[37:51.090 --> 37:53.090]  slash growfromyourheart.
[37:53.090 --> 37:57.090]  Patreon is P-A-T-R-E-O-N, Patreon.

[38:02.090 --> 38:04.090]  to contribute to the podcast.
[38:04.090 --> 38:06.090]  You can contribute as little as $1,
[38:06.090 --> 38:07.090]  and I honestly don't think there's a limit
[38:07.090 --> 38:09.090]  on how much you can contribute,
[38:09.090 --> 38:11.090]  and what I plan to do with your contributions
[38:11.090 --> 38:14.090]  is I am using those funds to keep my website alive.
[38:14.090 --> 38:17.090]  I read geneticscolorado.com costs me money
[38:17.090 --> 38:18.090]  to keep hosted every year,
[38:18.090 --> 38:20.090]  and I'm using the funds that you guys contribute
[38:20.090 --> 38:21.090]  to pay for that hosting.
[38:21.090 --> 38:23.090]  I am also going to use the funds
[38:23.090 --> 38:24.090]  to replace these microphone covers
[38:24.090 --> 38:26.090]  because all the guests come and spit into them.
[38:26.090 --> 38:29.090]  I just ordered a new memory card for my Zoom H6.
[38:29.090 --> 38:32.090]  I will use funds for that from the Patreon account.
[38:32.090 --> 38:34.090]  So if you feel like the show was worth a couple of bucks
[38:34.090 --> 38:36.090]  or a buck or whatever you can contribute,
[38:36.090 --> 38:37.090]  I would appreciate it if you go to
[38:37.090 --> 38:39.090]  patreon.com slash growfromyourheart
[38:39.090 --> 38:40.090]  and help me out if you can.
[38:40.090 --> 38:41.090]  You guys, I'm not begging.
[38:41.090 --> 38:44.090]  This podcast is always going to be free.
[38:44.090 --> 38:45.090]  I want to give you free grow lessons
[38:45.090 --> 38:47.090]  and free grow advice from my heart
[38:47.090 --> 38:48.090]  because I love cannabis,
[38:48.090 --> 38:49.090]  and I love helping people,
[38:49.090 --> 38:52.090]  and I love watching people improve their gardens.
[38:52.090 --> 38:54.090]  The look on somebody's face when they learn a trick
[38:54.090 --> 38:55.090]  and they grow pot better next time,
[38:55.090 --> 38:56.090]  it's fucking priceless to me.
[38:56.090 --> 38:58.090]  That's why I do this, but it is not free.
[38:58.090 --> 39:00.090]  It costs me money to host my website.
[39:00.090 --> 39:02.090]  It costs me money to buy the things
[39:02.090 --> 39:03.090]  that I need for the show.
[39:03.090 --> 39:04.090]  I don't mind doing it,
[39:04.090 --> 39:05.090]  but if you'd like to contribute,
[39:05.090 --> 39:06.090]  I would appreciate it.
[39:06.090 --> 39:07.090]  That's all.
[39:07.090 --> 39:08.090]  I'm not trying to beg.
[39:08.090 --> 39:09.090]  I'm not trying to get rich.
[39:09.090 --> 39:11.090]  I just want to offset the cost of the website.
[39:11.090 --> 39:13.090]  It costs me over $300 for hosting per year
[39:13.090 --> 39:15.090]  because I put out so much content,
[39:15.090 --> 39:17.090]  and the episodes are long,
[39:17.090 --> 39:18.090]  and they're high quality,
[39:18.090 --> 39:19.090]  so I use a lot of bandwidth,
[39:19.090 --> 39:20.090]  and you guys listen a lot,
[39:20.090 --> 39:22.090]  so there's a lot of bandwidth going on,
[39:22.090 --> 39:23.090]  so it costs me a little bit,
[39:23.090 --> 39:24.090]  and I'm just asking for help.
[39:24.090 --> 39:25.090]  I'm not begging.
[39:25.090 --> 39:26.090]  It sounds like I'm begging,
[39:26.090 --> 39:27.090]  so I'm going to wrap it up,
[39:27.090 --> 39:28.090]  but patreon.com.
[39:28.090 --> 39:30.090]  If you cannot contribute to Patreon,
[39:30.090 --> 39:31.090]  I still love you.
[39:31.090 --> 39:32.090]  I still want you to listen to the podcast.
[39:32.090 --> 39:34.090]  We're still friends.
[39:34.090 --> 39:35.090]  What you can do to help me
[39:35.090 --> 39:36.090]  is you can go to iTunes.
[39:36.090 --> 39:37.090]  You can go to the iTunes store.
[39:37.090 --> 39:38.090]  You can search for the
[39:38.090 --> 39:39.090]  Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[39:39.090 --> 39:41.090]  and you can type in a review
[39:41.090 --> 39:42.090]  and let me know what you think
[39:42.090 --> 39:43.090]  about the podcast,
[39:43.090 --> 39:44.090]  and I will read your review
[39:44.090 --> 39:46.090]  on a future episode.
[39:46.090 --> 39:47.090]  While you're there,
[39:47.090 --> 39:48.090]  you're given the option
[39:48.090 --> 39:49.090]  to give me an amount of stars.
[39:49.090 --> 39:50.090]  So far, everybody has given me
[39:50.090 --> 39:51.090]  a five-star rating.
[39:51.090 --> 39:52.090]  Click on the amount of stars
[39:52.090 --> 39:53.090]  that you feel I deserve,
[39:53.090 --> 39:54.090]  and I would appreciate
[39:54.090 --> 39:56.090]  your rating in iTunes.
[39:56.090 --> 39:57.090]  If you're not able to rate me in iTunes
[39:57.090 --> 39:59.090]  because you're not an iTunes user,
[39:59.090 --> 40:01.090]  simply share the podcast on Twitter.
[40:01.090 --> 40:02.090]  Follow me on Twitter.
[40:02.090 --> 40:03.090]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[40:03.090 --> 40:05.090]  When I post the tweet about the new episode,
[40:06.090 --> 40:07.090]  simply retweet it for me.
[40:07.090 --> 40:08.090]  That's all I'm asking for you.
[40:08.090 --> 40:09.090]  Just help me get the word out
[40:09.090 --> 40:10.090]  about the podcast.
[40:10.090 --> 40:11.090]  I would appreciate all of your help,
[40:11.090 --> 40:12.090]  because if you don't feel like
[40:12.090 --> 40:13.090]  pushing anything,
[40:13.090 --> 40:14.090]  if you just want to listen
[40:14.090 --> 40:15.090]  and grow better cannabis,
[40:15.090 --> 40:16.090]  I still love you.
[40:16.090 --> 40:17.090]  Keep growing.
[40:17.090 --> 40:18.090]  Grow from your heart.
[40:18.090 --> 40:19.090]  That's what I'm doing.
[40:19.090 --> 40:20.090]  I'm here to help you every week.
[40:20.090 --> 40:21.090]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[40:21.090 --> 40:22.090]  that's all I've got for you this week.
[40:22.090 --> 40:23.090]  My throat is burnt out.
[40:23.090 --> 40:24.090]  I'm out of oxygen.
[40:24.090 --> 40:26.090]  I want to thank you guys for listening.
[40:26.090 --> 40:27.090]  I'm going to wrap it up for this week.
[40:27.090 --> 40:28.090]  I want to give a huge shout-out
[40:28.090 --> 40:29.090]  to my buddy, Dr. Hambone,
[40:29.090 --> 40:30.090]  and until next time,
[40:30.090 --> 40:31.090]  take a fat dab
[40:31.090 --> 40:33.090]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[40:33.090 --> 40:36.090]  She won't let me fuck, babe
[40:36.090 --> 40:46.100]  She won't let me fuck, honey
[40:46.100 --> 40:49.100]  I really need to bust tonight
[40:49.100 --> 40:52.100]  Oh, oh, oh, oh
[40:52.100 --> 40:55.100]  It's so frustrating, yeah
[40:55.100 --> 40:59.100]  Being a man, yeah
[40:59.100 --> 41:01.100]  That's all I want at home
[41:01.100 --> 41:04.100]  All these sexy women
[41:05.100 --> 41:09.100]  Don't understand
[41:09.100 --> 41:14.880]  The things we need to do, yeah
[41:14.880 --> 41:18.880]  Every other day or two
[41:18.880 --> 41:20.880]  Like what, man?
[41:20.880 --> 41:22.880]  Like take you home, baby
[41:22.880 --> 41:28.440]  And make sweet love to you
[41:28.440 --> 41:31.440]  But you, you won't let me fuck
[41:31.440 --> 41:34.440]  You say the mood ain't right
[41:34.440 --> 41:37.440]  I really need to bust tonight
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.440]  I know that pussy's tight
[41:40.440 --> 41:42.440]  She won't let me fuck
[41:42.440 --> 41:43.440]  Give it to me, baby
[41:43.440 --> 41:47.440]  I really need to bust tonight
[41:47.440 --> 41:49.440]  Oh, oh, oh, oh
[41:49.440 --> 41:52.440]  Her heart is still broken
[41:52.440 --> 41:53.440]  Poor baby
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.440]  Her emotions are so
[41:57.440 --> 41:58.440]  I know what you mean, girl
[41:58.440 --> 42:02.440]  She's trying to recover
[42:02.440 --> 42:05.440]  From the man he fucked
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.690]  Her ex-boyfriend
[42:11.690 --> 42:16.690]  He probably can't see
[42:16.690 --> 42:20.690]  That it was easy for him
[42:20.690 --> 42:25.690]  But he made it hard for me
[42:25.690 --> 42:29.690]  Cause she, she won't let me fuck
[42:29.690 --> 42:31.690]  Give it to me, baby
[42:31.690 --> 42:34.690]  I really need to bust tonight
[42:34.690 --> 42:37.690]  You know just what I need, yeah
[42:37.690 --> 42:40.690]  She won't let me eat all my food
[42:40.690 --> 42:42.690]  Girl, I'm drinking all my beer
[42:42.690 --> 42:44.690]  I really need to bust tonight
[42:44.690 --> 42:47.690]  You're smoking all my weed, yeah
[42:47.690 --> 42:49.690]  You rub your ass against mine
[42:49.690 --> 42:52.690]  On the disco floor
[42:52.690 --> 42:54.690]  Shake that ass, shake that ass
[42:54.690 --> 42:56.690]  Shake, shake, shake, shake that ass
[42:56.690 --> 42:58.690]  I asked you for your number
[42:58.690 --> 43:02.690]  And you said, hell no
[43:02.690 --> 43:03.690]  That's all right, man
[43:03.690 --> 43:04.690]  Fuck that bitch
[43:04.690 --> 43:06.690]  Look at that one over there, cuz
[43:06.690 --> 43:08.690]  You always hang around me
[43:08.690 --> 43:10.690]  Yeah, she does
[43:10.690 --> 43:15.690]  Every day, yeah
[43:15.690 --> 43:19.690]  Different women wanna kick it
[43:19.690 --> 43:23.690]  But you scare them away, yeah
[43:23.690 --> 43:25.690]  She wanna steal, bro, baby
[43:25.690 --> 43:28.690]  Now I get offended
[43:28.690 --> 43:35.030]  When you come around
[43:35.030 --> 43:38.030]  Cause I'm tired of my organs
[43:38.030 --> 43:39.030]  Your organs
[43:39.030 --> 43:43.030]  Going up and down
[43:43.030 --> 43:44.030]  That suck
[43:44.030 --> 43:46.030]  Cause she won't let me fuck
[43:46.030 --> 43:47.030]  She won't let me fuck
[43:47.030 --> 43:49.030]  Give it to me, baby
[43:49.030 --> 43:52.030]  I really need to bust tonight
[43:52.030 --> 43:55.030]  Don't play with my head again
[43:55.030 --> 43:57.030]  She won't let me fuck
[43:57.030 --> 43:59.030]  Let me get it, baby
[43:59.030 --> 44:02.030]  I really need to bust tonight
[44:02.030 --> 44:05.030]  Are you a lesbian?
[44:05.030 --> 44:08.030]  Oh, let me lick it, baby
[44:08.030 --> 44:11.030]  Yeah, let me stick it, honey
[44:11.030 --> 44:15.030]  I'll give you my money
[44:15.030 --> 44:17.030]  Girl, you can have it all
[44:17.030 --> 44:20.030]  Go ahead and have a ball
[44:20.030 --> 44:24.030]  If you want, you can take them both, baby
[44:24.030 --> 44:26.030]  In the year 2000, I see thousand
[44:26.030 --> 44:28.030]  Of pretty young women I find arousing
[44:28.030 --> 44:31.030]  Grocery store shopping, magazine browsing
[44:31.030 --> 44:33.030]  Many different ways they keep their hairstyles in
[44:33.030 --> 44:35.030]  Full of boredom, I walk toward them
[44:35.030 --> 44:38.030]  Get them close to me, cause I'm supposed to speak
[44:38.030 --> 44:40.030]  The male aggressor, female impressor
[44:40.030 --> 44:42.030]  Say the right things, possibly undress her
[44:42.030 --> 44:45.030]  But that's the post game, this is still the pre game
[44:45.030 --> 44:47.030]  Silly woman, she game, baby, what's your name?
[44:47.030 --> 44:50.030]  Even though I'm a freak, I play it off like a college geek
[44:50.030 --> 44:53.030]  Crack a smile and politely speak with intellect
[44:53.030 --> 44:56.030]  To the woman I select, hoping that she won't detect
[44:56.030 --> 44:59.030]  My egotistical, chauvinistical lust
[44:59.030 --> 45:02.030]  I thrust till I scream like mystical
[45:02.030 --> 45:04.030]  The wrong message, I hope I'm not sending
[45:04.030 --> 45:07.030]  Laughing and pretending, my dick's not extending
[45:07.030 --> 45:09.030]  Can't be overzealous, she might discover
[45:09.030 --> 45:11.030]  She's walking away, blew my cover
[45:11.030 --> 45:15.030]  She won't let me fuck, you know I love it
[45:15.030 --> 45:18.030]  I really need to bust a nut
[45:18.030 --> 45:21.030]  Please don't change the subject, baby
[45:21.030 --> 45:25.030]  She won't let me fuck, we could've fucked all night long
[45:25.030 --> 45:28.030]  I really need to bust a nut
[45:28.030 --> 45:31.030]  But, but your telephone number is wrong
[45:31.030 --> 45:34.030]  She won't let me fuck, you got a lot to give
[45:34.030 --> 45:37.030]  I really need to bust a nut
[45:37.030 --> 45:41.030]  You dress so provocative
[45:41.030 --> 45:44.030]  She won't let me fuck, I can see your lingerie
[45:44.030 --> 45:46.030]  From your car away
[45:46.030 --> 45:48.030]  I really need to bust a nut, bitch
[45:48.030 --> 45:52.030]  You must think I'm gay
[46:22.030 --> 46:26.030]  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, let me
[46:26.030 --> 46:29.030]  Let me, let me, let me
[46:29.030 --> 46:31.030]  Don't make me bend
[46:31.030 --> 46:33.030]  Baby, let me love you
[46:33.030 --> 46:36.030]  Don't make me cry
[46:36.030 --> 46:41.030]  Look into my eye
[46:41.030 --> 46:43.030]  Girl, you so damn pretty
[46:43.030 --> 46:45.030]  Stop acting so seductive
[46:45.030 --> 46:49.030]  Let me put some oil on your
