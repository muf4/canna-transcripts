[00:00.000 --> 00:02.040]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:02.040 --> 00:06.080]  It is time for episode 454 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.080 --> 00:09.360]  This episode of the show is brought to you by my friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.360 --> 00:13.960]  If you need new seeds in your garden, I highly recommend Seeds Here Now, and you can find
[00:13.960 --> 00:19.680]  them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:19.680 --> 00:23.320]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:23.320 --> 00:27.740]  Today, I've been taking dabs of something called Holy Fuck from our friends at Green
[00:27.740 --> 00:28.740]  Dot Labs.
[00:28.880 --> 00:32.400]  I think the name Holy Fuck is perfect for this concentrate.
[00:32.400 --> 00:33.720]  Let's talk about this one.
[00:33.720 --> 00:36.760]  This is a blend of Sex on the Beach and Halo.
[00:36.760 --> 00:40.120]  The flavor is described as pina colada and fuel.
[00:40.120 --> 00:47.240]  On the back of the container, the label says this product contains 67.59% THC.
[00:47.240 --> 00:49.640]  This concentrate is fucking amazing.
[00:49.640 --> 00:51.440]  I see why they call it Holy Fuck.
[00:51.440 --> 00:53.280]  I'm going to crack it open right now.
[00:53.280 --> 00:55.640]  We're going to give it a fresh smell.
[00:55.640 --> 00:58.660]  The smells coming out of this container are amazing.
[00:58.680 --> 00:59.920]  There is pineapple.
[00:59.920 --> 01:00.920]  There is coconut.
[01:00.920 --> 01:04.400]  But then there is also a hint of gassy skunks.
[01:04.400 --> 01:06.360]  This stuff smells crazy.
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.480]  And then looking at it, it looks like a chunk of nice butter.
[01:10.480 --> 01:13.920]  If you've got like a fresh chunk of butter sitting on a tray, that is kind of what this
[01:13.920 --> 01:14.920]  looks like.
[01:14.920 --> 01:17.760]  Maybe a little piece of cheesecake just waiting for you to nibble on.
[01:17.760 --> 01:22.480]  The Holy Fuck live batter from Green Dot Labs is tremendous.
[01:22.480 --> 01:29.180]  Again, when you dab it, this stuff tastes like you just drank a pina colada or a horchata,
[01:29.180 --> 01:33.140]  or maybe you just drank some coconut milk with a little bit of pineapple juice in it.
[01:33.140 --> 01:35.540]  This stuff tastes ridiculously good.
[01:35.540 --> 01:39.780]  Then on the exhale, you get a sweetness with a little bit of fuel that just lingers for
[01:39.780 --> 01:41.140]  a few minutes.
[01:41.140 --> 01:42.460]  Really impressive concentrate.
[01:42.460 --> 01:44.460]  I'm really glad I picked this one up.
[01:44.460 --> 01:49.260]  Big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs for the Holy Fuck live batter.
[01:49.260 --> 01:51.180]  All right, podcast world.
[01:51.200 --> 01:55.240]  In this episode, I am going to read a listener email, but before we get there, let's do a
[01:55.240 --> 01:57.840]  shout out to some of our friends from Patreon.
[01:57.840 --> 02:01.160]  I want to give a giant shout out to our friend Brian B.
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.640]  I want to send a giant shout out to Jacob W.
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.480]  I owe a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to our friend Keith K.
[02:07.480 --> 02:10.160]  Of course, a giant shout out to our buddy Tommy.
[02:10.160 --> 02:13.160]  Of course, I need to send a shout out to my friend Dick Goals.
[02:13.160 --> 02:16.800]  As always, a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my friend Glenn G.
[02:16.980 --> 02:21.580]  Last but certainly not least, I want to send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out
[02:21.580 --> 02:25.460]  and a thank you to my friend, Canna You Dig It.
[02:25.460 --> 02:26.740]  All right, podcast world.
[02:26.740 --> 02:30.980]  I am going to get to that email that I mentioned before, but let's chat for a few minutes before
[02:30.980 --> 02:31.980]  we get there.
[02:31.980 --> 02:35.340]  I've got a couple of things I would like to tell you about before we get to that email.
[02:35.340 --> 02:39.340]  Let's talk about something I got to do just a few days ago.
[02:39.340 --> 02:43.620]  Recently, I was given a clone of the Mac One Cut by a very good friend.
[02:43.620 --> 02:44.620]  Big thanks.
[02:44.620 --> 02:45.780]  I'm not sure if he wants a shout out on the show.
[02:45.780 --> 02:49.820]  I'm sure he doesn't want everybody else messaging him, asking him for a clone.
[02:49.820 --> 02:54.500]  Big private personal shout out to my friend who gave me a clone of the Mac One.
[02:54.500 --> 02:59.940]  That Mac One is one of the slowest growing plants I have ever worked with.
[02:59.940 --> 03:01.980]  That plant is being fed great nutrients.
[03:01.980 --> 03:06.180]  That plant is in a great environment, but it does not want to grow.
[03:06.180 --> 03:10.060]  Everybody I talk to says that the Mac grows ridiculously slowly.
[03:10.060 --> 03:11.380]  I think I've got her happy.
[03:11.380 --> 03:14.880]  I was able to take a clone off the Mac, so I've got a large veg plant.
[03:14.980 --> 03:18.960]  I've got a clone that is rooted and happy that's working as my backup mother plant.
[03:18.960 --> 03:25.640]  I have since then dragged my Mac One Cut into my flowering room, and it has been pollinated
[03:25.640 --> 03:29.400]  by my Arise male known as King Solomon.
[03:29.400 --> 03:35.200]  So I have officially pollinated the Mac One Cut with my prized King Solomon male.
[03:35.200 --> 03:36.280]  I'm quite excited.
[03:36.280 --> 03:38.320]  I can see that the pollination took.
[03:38.320 --> 03:42.200]  I can see that there are a few spots where seeds are actually developing.
[03:42.200 --> 03:46.920]  I don't expect a lot of seeds, but I should get at least a few seeds for myself to play
[03:46.920 --> 03:49.920]  with out of this first initial cross.
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.120]  Many other breeders have told me that the Mac is hard to breed with.
[03:53.120 --> 03:55.000]  They have said that it does not take pollen well.
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.440]  They said it does not produce a lot of seeds, and oftentimes the progeny is very unstable.
[04:01.440 --> 04:05.840]  I do not know what to expect from my Mac to Arise cross.
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.760]  Every time I have smoked the Mac, it has been a memorable experience.
[04:09.760 --> 04:11.500]  The flavor of the Mac is great.
[04:11.500 --> 04:13.260]  The buzz from the Mac is great.
[04:13.260 --> 04:16.740]  The only downside to this plant is the way that it grows.
[04:16.740 --> 04:23.300]  I am hoping that by pollinating it by my Arise male, that I will fix that slow growth and
[04:23.300 --> 04:25.860]  give this plant a little more vigor.
[04:25.860 --> 04:30.260]  That King Solomon plant is known to put hyper vigor into its hybrids.
[04:30.260 --> 04:35.780]  So hopefully out of the few seeds I did generate, I will be able to find a phenotype in there
[04:35.780 --> 04:41.140]  that is very representative of the Mac potency, very representative of the Mac flavor, but
[04:41.300 --> 04:47.380]  I can correct the growth problems by using that robust, really vigorous Arise male and
[04:47.380 --> 04:53.540]  hopefully put that trait into the progeny, find a phenotype that is a perfect 50-50 balance,
[04:53.540 --> 04:56.680]  and then we can see what I want to do with that from there.
[04:56.680 --> 04:58.700]  So far, this is just a personal project.
[04:58.700 --> 05:00.420]  I just wanted to play with the Mac.
[05:00.420 --> 05:03.040]  Somebody was kind enough to gift me a clone of it.
[05:03.040 --> 05:07.020]  As a known breeder, I think the next step is for me to pollinate this plant and see
[05:07.020 --> 05:08.700]  what we create.
[05:08.700 --> 05:09.700]  So stay tuned.
[05:09.700 --> 05:10.900]  I will keep you posted.
[05:11.660 --> 05:15.380]  We are at least 40 to 50 days away from these seeds being harvested.
[05:15.380 --> 05:20.260]  So I will have no feedback for you for at least 40 to 50 days.
[05:20.260 --> 05:22.100]  Then I will harvest the plant.
[05:22.100 --> 05:25.580]  Then once the plant is dry, I will crumble up the buds into a dust.
[05:25.580 --> 05:28.060]  Then it will pull the seeds out and count them.
[05:28.060 --> 05:29.460]  That will be your next update.
[05:29.460 --> 05:31.500]  How many seeds did I get?
[05:31.500 --> 05:35.820]  After that, when I do have time and space, I will grow those seeds.
[05:35.820 --> 05:41.380]  I guarantee you that when I grow out those Mac 1 to Arise seeds, you will see ridiculous
[05:41.380 --> 05:46.120]  amounts of photos and a lot of updates here on the podcast.
[05:46.120 --> 05:47.540]  So please stick around.
[05:47.540 --> 05:48.540]  Please stay tuned.
[05:48.540 --> 05:53.280]  I will keep you updated as that project progresses.
[05:53.280 --> 05:58.320]  Another fun thing I have been working on is watching my friends receive their new testers
[05:58.320 --> 06:02.140]  of something I am calling the red pill or the blue pill.
[06:02.140 --> 06:03.140]  That's right.
[06:03.140 --> 06:04.140]  I have made some testers.
[06:04.140 --> 06:05.580]  They are feminized seeds.
[06:06.340 --> 06:09.460]  I don't have the space to test them in my personal garden, so I have recruited some
[06:09.460 --> 06:13.540]  very reliable friends to test grow these seeds for me.
[06:13.540 --> 06:17.260]  Several of the packages have landed at my friends' locations and they have germinated
[06:17.260 --> 06:18.340]  these seeds.
[06:18.340 --> 06:24.100]  I am excited to watch the testing of the red pill and the blue pill unfold.
[06:24.100 --> 06:26.540]  There was also a third option that some people received.
[06:26.540 --> 06:28.700]  It is not a feminized cross.
[06:28.700 --> 06:30.980]  It is a rare Indica dominant cross.
[06:30.980 --> 06:33.660]  Most of the things I make are very sativa dominant.
[06:33.660 --> 06:36.740]  This one is going to be heavy on the Indica side.
[06:36.740 --> 06:39.860]  So I am quite excited to see what comes from these tester seeds.
[06:39.860 --> 06:41.220]  I have sent out the red pill.
[06:41.220 --> 06:42.580]  I have sent out the blue pill.
[06:42.580 --> 06:45.020]  And I have sent out the Indica dominant cross.
[06:45.020 --> 06:46.020]  They have landed.
[06:46.020 --> 06:47.020]  They have been germinated.
[06:47.020 --> 06:51.540]  And before too long, we will start seeing progress photos.
[06:51.540 --> 06:55.560]  One thing that I find really entertaining is I just randomly labeled these seeds as
[06:55.560 --> 06:59.340]  the red pill or the blue pill and offered them to my friends as testers.
[06:59.340 --> 07:02.680]  And I said, would you like the red pill or the blue pill?
[07:02.700 --> 07:04.240]  It is just an arbitrary name.
[07:04.240 --> 07:07.620]  It has nothing to do with the plants themselves, with the seeds themselves.
[07:07.620 --> 07:09.940]  I just wanted to pick a label that was fun.
[07:09.940 --> 07:13.960]  The red pill or the blue pill sounded like a fun offering for my friends.
[07:13.960 --> 07:19.120]  The best part of the whole situation was that everybody who was given the option selected
[07:19.120 --> 07:20.920]  the red pill.
[07:20.920 --> 07:23.720]  Nobody selected the blue pill when given the option.
[07:23.720 --> 07:28.400]  I don't know what kind of weird psychological game that was, but I thought it was very interesting
[07:28.400 --> 07:31.680]  that everybody selected the red pill.
[07:31.680 --> 07:32.800]  So once again, stay tuned.
[07:32.800 --> 07:34.900]  I've got a bunch of great tester seeds out.
[07:34.900 --> 07:36.440]  We should start seeing photos.
[07:36.440 --> 07:39.680]  I will start giving you more reports and more updates on those testers.
[07:39.680 --> 07:42.280]  I will let you know if they will be released to the public.
[07:42.280 --> 07:47.480]  And once testing is complete, before I release them, I will announce the genetics and the
[07:47.480 --> 07:49.520]  official release name.
[07:49.520 --> 07:52.160]  So if you were a tester, please be patient.
[07:52.160 --> 07:57.040]  I promise you, I will tell you everything about those seeds when the time is right.
[07:57.040 --> 08:00.480]  Now I'm sure a lot of people are saying, Rostagef has test growers.
[08:00.480 --> 08:01.480]  Yes, I do.
[08:01.480 --> 08:06.200]  And I'm sure a lot of those people are wondering, how do I become one of those testers?
[08:06.200 --> 08:09.120]  Let me tell you right now, the easiest way to do that.
[08:09.120 --> 08:15.080]  If you would like to become a tester for iRegenetics, all you have to do is send an email to iRegenetics
[08:15.080 --> 08:17.120]  at hotmail.com.
[08:17.120 --> 08:19.600]  In the subject line, put tester.
[08:19.600 --> 08:23.160]  Then, in your email, impress me.
[08:23.160 --> 08:28.080]  Explain to me why you feel like you are qualified to test grow seeds for me before I release
[08:28.080 --> 08:29.960]  them to the public.
[08:29.960 --> 08:31.880]  I need people who can take good notes.
[08:31.880 --> 08:34.280]  I need people who can communicate well.
[08:34.280 --> 08:36.980]  I need people who can take quality photographs.
[08:36.980 --> 08:40.720]  I need people who are not going to get these seeds and disappear on me.
[08:40.720 --> 08:45.960]  If you think you can be a reliable tester for iRegenetics seeds, send me an email.
[08:45.960 --> 08:48.560]  It's iRegenetics at hotmail.com.
[08:48.560 --> 08:53.960]  You have to put the word tester in the subject line, and then in the body of that email,
[08:53.960 --> 08:54.960]  impress me.
[08:54.960 --> 08:59.560]  Let me know why you are qualified to test my unreleased seeds.
[08:59.560 --> 09:02.160]  Good pictures will go a long way.
[09:02.160 --> 09:07.560]  I always talk about looking at my friends' photos, and when it comes time to select testers,
[09:07.560 --> 09:11.640]  sometimes I randomly go to my friends who have posted good photos, and I say, hey, bro,
[09:11.640 --> 09:13.680]  would you like to test some stuff for me?
[09:13.680 --> 09:16.320]  And 90% of the time, they say, yes, I would.
[09:16.320 --> 09:19.060]  So good photos go a long way.
[09:19.060 --> 09:23.280]  If you can take good notes, if you can stay in touch with me throughout the entire grow,
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.040]  and if you can take quality photos, you may qualify to be an iRegenetics tester.
[09:28.040 --> 09:32.080]  Once again, the email address is iRegenetics at hotmail.com.
[09:32.080 --> 09:36.920]  Make sure you put the word tester in the subject line, and make sure you impress me in your
[09:36.920 --> 09:37.920]  email.
[09:37.920 --> 09:42.320]  All right, I've got one more thing to ramble about before we get into this email.
[09:42.320 --> 09:45.840]  Let's talk about something I've been focused on for most of the week.
[09:45.840 --> 09:49.920]  I am a little bit limited on how much I'm allowed to share on this project, but I've
[09:49.920 --> 09:57.960]  spent most of my week working on a revised floor plan and an application to open one
[09:57.960 --> 10:03.080]  of the first medical marijuana cultivation facilities in another state that are just
[10:03.080 --> 10:06.280]  about ready to roll out their medical marijuana program.
[10:06.280 --> 10:10.480]  I can't give you too many details, but I can tell you that I have been working day and
[10:10.480 --> 10:14.980]  night for the past week, getting an application filled out, making sure that all of the questions
[10:14.980 --> 10:16.600]  are answered sufficiently.
[10:16.600 --> 10:20.600]  I've been working with a large team to make sure that this project goes smoothly, and
[10:20.600 --> 10:25.640]  today we officially finished our application process and the application has been turned
[10:25.640 --> 10:26.640]  in.
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.520]  I feel like we completed all of the questions to the best of our ability, and we stand a
[10:30.520 --> 10:38.120]  very good chance of being granted our requested license for a large medical marijuana cultivation
[10:38.120 --> 10:39.120]  facility.
[10:39.120 --> 10:42.320]  Now, I'm sure by now a lot of people are going, oh shit, is Rasta Jeff going to move?
[10:42.320 --> 10:44.780]  No, don't worry, I am not relocating.
[10:44.780 --> 10:50.060]  This new project may require a little bit more travel, but I can do 75% to 85% of the
[10:50.060 --> 10:52.260]  work that is required online.
[10:52.260 --> 10:55.960]  Most of it is done through video chat and conference calls and Google Docs, so that
[10:55.960 --> 10:57.740]  makes things very easy.
[10:57.740 --> 10:59.940]  But I am working very closely with this group.
[10:59.940 --> 11:03.940]  We have designed a very nice facility, we have created a very nice workflow, and I feel
[11:03.940 --> 11:08.660]  like we stand a very good chance of having our application approved.
[11:08.660 --> 11:13.140]  So in the very near future, I should be able to announce that in another state, there will
[11:13.140 --> 11:18.420]  be an iRegenetics-run large-scale medical marijuana cultivation facility.
[11:18.420 --> 11:22.740]  Now, we can't celebrate yet, we still have to have the license approved, but I feel like
[11:22.740 --> 11:26.060]  we stand a very good chance.
[11:26.060 --> 11:30.920]  And even if we don't get approved, I learned a lot in this application process.
[11:30.920 --> 11:34.860]  This new state had a lot of very detailed questions.
[11:34.860 --> 11:37.140]  I haven't seen an application like this yet.
[11:37.140 --> 11:39.740]  They broke it down into several categories.
[11:39.740 --> 11:44.180]  I really like the way that this place is rolling out their medical marijuana rules.
[11:44.180 --> 11:49.260]  They work very well with cultivators, they work very well with dispensary owners or potential
[11:49.260 --> 11:54.020]  dispensary owners, and I feel like they want to understand the industry more than they
[11:54.020 --> 11:55.680]  want to limit the industry.
[11:55.680 --> 11:59.100]  Another state I work with, I feel like they just keep setting up hurdles.
[11:59.100 --> 12:00.660]  They're like, you want medical marijuana?
[12:00.660 --> 12:04.180]  We'd love to give it to you, but first do a backflip over this, and then roll through
[12:04.180 --> 12:07.820]  this fire, and then you got to fucking tug on this rope, and then you got to go through
[12:07.820 --> 12:09.780]  an American Ninja Warrior course.
[12:09.780 --> 12:13.580]  And this other state, it feels like they're saying, oh, you want medical marijuana?
[12:13.580 --> 12:15.680]  What can we do to make this happen for you?
[12:15.680 --> 12:17.800]  So this new state is very welcoming.
[12:17.800 --> 12:20.540]  It feels like it is going to be a very great rollout.
[12:20.540 --> 12:25.100]  And if the group that I'm involved with get our license approved or not, I am still very
[12:25.100 --> 12:29.720]  proud to have been a part of the project that I am participating in, and I am still very
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.260]  excited to see how this state rolls out their medical marijuana program.
[12:34.340 --> 12:39.500]  Now, with all of that being said, let's talk about how tedious these licenses are.
[12:39.500 --> 12:41.640]  There were hundreds of questions.
[12:41.640 --> 12:45.780]  It took a team of us weeks to answer all of these questions.
[12:45.780 --> 12:50.060]  We would answer the questions, we would submit the questions to the team, the lawyers, and
[12:50.060 --> 12:52.820]  everybody else, the architects, and whoever else wanted to get involved.
[12:52.820 --> 12:55.940]  We would all read the questions and nitpick it and pick it apart.
[12:55.940 --> 12:58.780]  And then you get an email and it says, hey, your answer was close.
[12:58.780 --> 13:00.340]  We need a few more details.
[13:00.340 --> 13:04.920]  We'd rework it and then send it back and the process would happen all over again.
[13:04.920 --> 13:09.260]  It took a very long time to get everything worded to where it was acceptable for the
[13:09.260 --> 13:14.520]  lawyers, for the doctor side, for the cultivator side, for the state side.
[13:14.520 --> 13:18.240]  We had to word everything to where it all made sense, to where everybody could understand
[13:18.240 --> 13:20.940]  it and it was still completely accurate.
[13:20.940 --> 13:23.540]  That takes a lot of time and a lot of review.
[13:23.540 --> 13:30.100]  We designed an entire plan from planting a seed to a patient consuming our product.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.140]  We've got every detail written down.
[13:32.140 --> 13:34.740]  I think we've got a great chance.
[13:34.740 --> 13:39.880]  Now after spending a couple of weeks on a project like this, I want to talk about how
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.020]  much businesses need your support.
[13:44.020 --> 13:48.780]  Any business that is open and running, I don't care if it is Starbucks, I don't care if it's
[13:48.780 --> 13:54.180]  a dispensary, I don't care if it is the most giant mall filled with stores, I don't care
[13:54.180 --> 13:56.460]  what type of business it is.
[13:56.460 --> 14:01.140]  Every business needs customer and community support.
[14:01.140 --> 14:07.100]  We put a lot of time, we put a lot of energy, and we put a lot of effort into establishing
[14:07.100 --> 14:10.460]  a solid business so that we can offer a service.
[14:10.460 --> 14:13.660]  We're not just opening a business so that we can make money.
[14:13.660 --> 14:17.860]  Anybody that listens to this show knows that I am very passionate about cannabis.
[14:17.860 --> 14:22.820]  I am passionate about recreational cannabis and I am passionate about medical cannabis.
[14:22.820 --> 14:26.420]  I am a strong, heavy cannabis consumer.
[14:26.420 --> 14:31.280]  Cannabis changed my life, cannabis saved my life, and cannabis continues to save my
[14:31.280 --> 14:35.540]  life and the lives of my friends and family on a daily basis.
[14:35.540 --> 14:38.040]  So I've got a passion for cannabis.
[14:38.040 --> 14:42.460]  I want to see other people enjoy cannabis the way that I do.
[14:42.460 --> 14:48.280]  I want to see other people feel relief by using cannabis in a way that improves the
[14:48.280 --> 14:50.180]  quality of their life.
[14:50.180 --> 14:54.260]  So not only am I in the cannabis industry for the business aspect, of course I like
[14:54.260 --> 14:55.260]  to make some money.
[14:55.260 --> 14:56.260]  I like to buy nice drums.
[14:56.300 --> 14:57.900]  I like to eat like a fucking king.
[14:57.900 --> 15:00.100]  I like to smoke good concentrates.
[15:00.100 --> 15:01.380]  But that is not what I'm here for.
[15:01.380 --> 15:04.380]  I am in this industry because I am passionate.
[15:04.380 --> 15:08.980]  I like watching a person improve the quality of their life by consuming a product that
[15:08.980 --> 15:12.860]  I created or grew or invested my time and energy in.
[15:12.860 --> 15:17.020]  I get to see people who have a discomfort or an ailment.
[15:17.020 --> 15:19.420]  They show up and they're like, I don't feel well.
[15:19.420 --> 15:22.460]  They leave with the product and they come back several days later and they say, Ross
[15:22.460 --> 15:27.260]  to Jeff, that whatever product it was that you gave me made my whatever problem that
[15:27.260 --> 15:29.500]  I had go away for a few hours.
[15:29.500 --> 15:31.500]  I was able to hang out with my family.
[15:31.500 --> 15:35.220]  I was able to enjoy a few minutes with my children and not feel like a grumpy asshole
[15:35.220 --> 15:39.300]  because whatever hurts was hurting or whatever bothers me was bothering me.
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.860]  So I get to offer a great service.
[15:40.860 --> 15:43.660]  I get to produce a product that makes people feel better.
[15:43.660 --> 15:48.140]  And then in the retail end of my business, I get to get that product out to those people.
[15:48.140 --> 15:51.820]  And in turn, yes, we do make a few dollars and we pay the rent.
[15:52.380 --> 15:57.020]  Without the support of our community and the support of our, I hate the word customers,
[15:57.020 --> 16:00.220]  our patients, our clientele, we don't have a business.
[16:00.220 --> 16:02.700]  My passion just becomes a hobby.
[16:02.700 --> 16:06.580]  Without the support of our community and our friends and our family, and I hate using the
[16:06.580 --> 16:12.020]  word customers, but without them, those businesses, the dispensary will be forced to close.
[16:12.020 --> 16:14.940]  Once that dispensary closes, there's no need for the cultivation.
[16:14.940 --> 16:16.740]  So the cultivation will close.
[16:16.740 --> 16:18.300]  And this goes for any business.
[16:18.300 --> 16:21.900]  If you don't go to whatever your favorite coffee spot is or your favorite sandwich spot
[16:21.900 --> 16:26.060]  and spend a few bucks every occasionally, when you do think about going to that sandwich
[16:26.060 --> 16:28.100]  shop, it will probably be gone.
[16:28.100 --> 16:30.420]  It is a very competitive economy.
[16:30.420 --> 16:32.420]  It's a very competitive market right now.
[16:32.420 --> 16:36.180]  So any business has to do everything that they can to survive.
[16:36.180 --> 16:41.100]  So I guess what I'm saying with all of this rambling is please support your local businesses,
[16:41.100 --> 16:45.180]  whether they're dispensaries, whether they're your local favorite taco shop, whether it's
[16:45.180 --> 16:50.940]  your local favorite waffle cone, ice cream truck, shout out to my buddy Coop Dog, whatever
[16:50.940 --> 16:58.300]  that business is, please support the businesses that do quality service for your community.
[16:58.300 --> 17:01.340]  Of course, I want you to support the dispensaries, which I work with.
[17:01.340 --> 17:05.060]  Of course, I want you to support the places where my cultivated product ends up and the
[17:05.060 --> 17:10.040]  places I do consultations for, but your local dispensary needs your support.
[17:10.040 --> 17:12.180]  Your local whatever needs your support.
[17:12.180 --> 17:17.580]  So let's get out there and support our local businesses and let's kind of stop some of
[17:17.580 --> 17:22.300]  the infighting and the bickering about dispensaries and the cannabis industry.
[17:22.300 --> 17:24.100]  We're trying our best.
[17:24.100 --> 17:29.060]  There are a lot of rules and regulations and hoops to jump through that make things a little
[17:29.060 --> 17:31.340]  bit difficult sometimes.
[17:31.340 --> 17:34.900]  We want to make medicine available to patients.
[17:34.900 --> 17:42.020]  We want the most potent, the highest quality, the cleanest, safest, most effective medicine
[17:42.060 --> 17:44.620]  that a patient can get at the best price.
[17:44.620 --> 17:45.940]  That is our goal.
[17:45.940 --> 17:48.140]  Don't think that we're out there just trying to get rich.
[17:48.140 --> 17:50.480]  We want to get medicine to patients.
[17:50.480 --> 17:55.500]  A lot of what causes hiccups or problems are regulations.
[17:55.500 --> 17:57.540]  A lot of those we cannot avoid.
[17:57.540 --> 17:59.380]  We want to give you a service.
[17:59.380 --> 18:05.020]  So a lot of people have some hatred and some kind of grief against dispensaries and against
[18:05.020 --> 18:06.600]  commercial grows.
[18:06.600 --> 18:09.700]  Please understand we are out here doing our best.
[18:09.700 --> 18:11.460]  We don't make up a lot of the rules.
[18:11.460 --> 18:13.160]  We don't make up a lot of the regulations.
[18:13.160 --> 18:15.860]  If it were up to us, we would grow the cannabis.
[18:15.860 --> 18:17.460]  We would just open the back door.
[18:17.460 --> 18:20.740]  You guys would come in and pay two or three bucks a gram and smoke out while you're rolling
[18:20.740 --> 18:21.740]  it up.
[18:21.740 --> 18:22.740]  It would be a party.
[18:22.740 --> 18:26.900]  Unfortunately, there are rules and regulations that come with legalization and we have got
[18:26.900 --> 18:30.660]  to follow them if we want to continue to operate.
[18:30.660 --> 18:34.900]  So keep in mind that the dispensaries and the cultivations are businesses.
[18:34.900 --> 18:39.700]  And if we don't operate them as a business, they won't be there the next time you go to
[18:39.700 --> 18:40.700]  shop.
[18:40.940 --> 18:45.260]  Honestly, if it were that easy to set up a cultivation facility and produce a quality,
[18:45.260 --> 18:50.540]  clean, safe product on a reliable schedule, wouldn't everybody else already be doing it?
[18:50.540 --> 18:53.380]  The professionals are out there trying our best.
[18:53.380 --> 18:54.740]  Please bear with us.
[18:54.740 --> 19:00.240]  Let's end the public versus the dispensary, the black market versus the legal market.
[19:00.240 --> 19:03.260]  Let's try to end all of that and let's just be team cannabis.
[19:03.260 --> 19:07.340]  All right, that's enough public service announcements for this episode.
[19:07.340 --> 19:11.300]  Let's get into the email portion of this podcast.
[19:11.300 --> 19:14.740]  If you have any cultivation or cannabis culture questions, I would love to hear from you.
[19:14.740 --> 19:19.020]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[19:19.020 --> 19:23.340]  This first email in this episode comes from a person who did not include their name.
[19:23.340 --> 19:24.340]  So let's jump right into it.
[19:24.340 --> 19:25.420]  It says, what's up?
[19:25.420 --> 19:26.420]  Just a quick question.
[19:26.420 --> 19:29.980]  I am at day 37 of 1212 today.
[19:29.980 --> 19:32.300]  So we're 37 days into flower.
[19:32.300 --> 19:37.620]  He goes on to say, I have two lights on a digital timer and one on a tab timer.
[19:37.620 --> 19:43.200]  Well, a storm hit four days ago and the electric went out for about an hour right after the
[19:43.200 --> 19:44.740]  lights came on for the day.
[19:44.740 --> 19:47.140]  I can kind of already see where this email is headed.
[19:47.140 --> 19:52.900]  He says, the digital timer was fine because it holds the time if it cuts off or unplugs,
[19:52.900 --> 19:57.500]  but the tab timer stopped for about an hour while the power was out.
[19:57.500 --> 20:01.620]  So let me talk about what happened there because some people may not have caught onto that.
[20:01.620 --> 20:05.300]  This person has two different timers in their grow room.
[20:05.300 --> 20:07.700]  They've got lights plugged into both timers.
[20:07.700 --> 20:12.620]  They have both timers set for 1212 to where both timers come on at a given time, both
[20:12.620 --> 20:15.060]  go off at a given time.
[20:15.060 --> 20:18.860]  However, the power went out in this person's house.
[20:18.860 --> 20:22.340]  So the digital timer kept on ticking with the correct time.
[20:22.340 --> 20:23.620]  It's got a battery backup.
[20:23.620 --> 20:24.620]  It is digital.
[20:24.620 --> 20:26.020]  It keeps on moving.
[20:26.020 --> 20:27.860]  Nothing went wrong there.
[20:27.860 --> 20:32.820]  On the other light, there is a timer with little push tabs that you push down for the
[20:32.820 --> 20:35.580]  light to be on and you pop them up for the light to be off.
[20:35.580 --> 20:38.020]  It could be the opposite, but it doesn't matter right now.
[20:38.020 --> 20:41.900]  You push tabs and the lights either off or on when it's on that section.
[20:41.900 --> 20:45.620]  And then when it goes to the other section, it does the opposite.
[20:45.620 --> 20:49.420]  That timer has a dial on it that spins like a real clock.
[20:49.420 --> 20:54.060]  And that is what triggers the switch to go on or off.
[20:54.060 --> 20:57.420]  Now when the power stops, that timer stops as well.
[20:57.420 --> 20:58.980]  It does not spin anymore.
[20:58.980 --> 21:01.180]  It does not have a battery backup.
[21:01.180 --> 21:07.580]  So if the power went out at one o'clock, that grow room, that timer thought that it was
[21:07.580 --> 21:10.920]  one o'clock until the power came back on.
[21:10.920 --> 21:14.100]  So time stood still for that one timer.
[21:14.100 --> 21:18.060]  The digital timer resumed its normal schedule when the power came on.
[21:18.060 --> 21:20.060]  The lights came on just like it should.
[21:20.060 --> 21:21.600]  Everything functioned.
[21:21.640 --> 21:26.760]  Now when the lights were scheduled to go off is when we had our problem.
[21:26.760 --> 21:33.360]  Since that one timer was off for a duration of time, it is now behind by that exact duration.
[21:33.360 --> 21:39.560]  So when the digital timer clicked off, our spinny dial timer continued to light the room.
[21:39.560 --> 21:41.680]  So now let's catch up with the question.
[21:41.680 --> 21:43.400]  Here is some more.
[21:43.400 --> 21:48.240]  He says, the digital timer was fine because it holds the time if it cuts off, but the
[21:48.240 --> 21:50.300]  tab timer stopped for one hour.
[21:50.300 --> 21:55.220]  So we had one extra hour of light time at the end of that flowering day.
[21:55.220 --> 21:56.220]  The email keeps going.
[21:56.220 --> 22:02.700]  It says, so my question is, since my girls are used to total darkness starting at 6 p.m.,
[22:02.700 --> 22:06.980]  is it going to hurt anything now that they have been getting one extra hour of light
[22:06.980 --> 22:08.820]  for four days?
[22:08.820 --> 22:09.820]  Thanks and cheers.
[22:09.820 --> 22:10.820]  P.S.
[22:10.820 --> 22:13.760]  Your podcast has helped me and mine more than once.
[22:13.760 --> 22:14.940]  So thank you for that.
[22:14.940 --> 22:16.020]  Hey, you are very welcome.
[22:16.020 --> 22:18.580]  I'm glad that I've helped you out a couple of times in the past.
[22:18.580 --> 22:21.900]  I hope that I can help you out again this time.
[22:21.900 --> 22:27.980]  So for four days, you had an extra one hour of light in your flower room.
[22:27.980 --> 22:30.940]  You are 37 days into flower.
[22:30.940 --> 22:34.080]  Now we've got a couple of things to think about.
[22:34.080 --> 22:37.180]  We are nearly 40 days into the flowering cycle.
[22:37.180 --> 22:43.820]  I am hoping that this light interruption did not cause any hermaphrodite issues in your
[22:43.820 --> 22:45.780]  grow.
[22:45.780 --> 22:51.420]  Interruptions of the dark cycle are the number one trigger for hermaphrodites in your plants.
[22:51.420 --> 22:54.740]  Now if your plants herm, we'll be up to a couple of things.
[22:54.740 --> 22:56.100]  First thing is genetics.
[22:56.100 --> 22:58.140]  How stable are those genetics?
[22:58.140 --> 23:00.580]  Have you ever seen those plants herm before?
[23:00.580 --> 23:03.480]  Have they ever hermed out due to any other type of stress?
[23:03.480 --> 23:07.460]  If so, you may see some hermaphrodites in this crop.
[23:07.460 --> 23:11.020]  Now the plants may be too far into flower to herm on you.
[23:11.020 --> 23:13.920]  They may just be so far into flower that they're like, whatever.
[23:13.920 --> 23:16.600]  We don't even care that you interrupted us for a couple of days.
[23:16.600 --> 23:18.440]  We're going to be just fine.
[23:18.440 --> 23:21.360]  That is up to the genetics of the plant.
[23:21.360 --> 23:26.540]  Now being that late into the flowering phase, if they do decide to herm, you've got a couple
[23:26.540 --> 23:27.540]  of options.
[23:27.540 --> 23:29.300]  You may see some bananas pop up.
[23:29.300 --> 23:34.380]  You can remove those bananas if you'd like, but you are so close to harvest that you won't
[23:34.380 --> 23:37.740]  have time to produce mature seeds.
[23:37.740 --> 23:41.620]  It generally takes four to six weeks to develop a seed.
[23:41.620 --> 23:45.460]  Flower plants are probably going to come down much sooner than that.
[23:45.460 --> 23:50.360]  You may have some small white seeds in your crop, but again, that just depends on the
[23:50.360 --> 23:51.980]  genetics of each plant.
[23:51.980 --> 23:53.860]  I don't know what plants you've got in your room.
[23:53.860 --> 23:56.140]  I don't know what other stressors you've got going on.
[23:56.140 --> 23:57.580]  I don't know what they've been fed.
[23:57.580 --> 24:01.460]  I don't know if you've got other environmental factors that may contribute to stress that
[24:01.460 --> 24:05.740]  may lead to these plants showing hermaphroditic traits.
[24:05.740 --> 24:10.740]  So at this point, you've got about 23 to 30 days left on your flowering phase.
[24:10.860 --> 24:14.180]  I would get them back on 12-12 as soon as possible.
[24:14.180 --> 24:18.700]  I would also get rid of that tab timer and replace it with another digital timer.
[24:18.700 --> 24:22.460]  I'm sure you've learned your lesson, and I'm sure that a lot of other people listening
[24:22.460 --> 24:25.880]  have just learned a very valuable lesson through that.
[24:25.880 --> 24:30.620]  So get rid of that tab timer and get yourself another digital timer so you don't have this
[24:30.620 --> 24:32.300]  problem again.
[24:32.300 --> 24:37.540]  Once you've got the time corrected, you have to pay close attention to the plants.
[24:37.540 --> 24:39.100]  You may see bananas.
[24:39.100 --> 24:41.820]  You may see little hermaphrodite flowers pop up.
[24:41.820 --> 24:45.660]  If you see those, you need to consider your next step.
[24:45.660 --> 24:47.040]  Do you want to pluck those?
[24:47.040 --> 24:48.780]  Do you want to cut off that branch?
[24:48.780 --> 24:53.500]  It just depends on how many nanners or male flowers you see developing.
[24:53.500 --> 24:58.300]  If it's just one or two, I may spray it with a little water and then pluck it with tweezers.
[24:58.300 --> 25:02.200]  Depending on how far along in the flower, I honestly may just leave it.
[25:02.200 --> 25:07.320]  Quite often, hermaphrodite flowers that pop up that late in flower are sterile.
[25:07.320 --> 25:09.480]  They do not contain any pollen.
[25:09.480 --> 25:14.520]  I understand that you may not want to run the risk of a male plant that may or may not
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.760]  contain pollen, so you may want to spray those, remove them with tweezers.
[25:18.760 --> 25:21.620]  If there are a lot in one bud, cut out the bud.
[25:21.620 --> 25:24.700]  If there's a lot in one branch, cut out the branch.
[25:24.700 --> 25:30.240]  If there are a lot on one plant, it is time to consider removing that plant from the grow.
[25:30.240 --> 25:34.400]  If your plants are showing hermaphroditic traits from this light interruption, I would
[25:34.400 --> 25:37.840]  consider different cultivars for my next grow.
[25:37.840 --> 25:41.040]  You know that these plants have the potential for hermaphroditism.
[25:41.040 --> 25:42.480]  I wouldn't grow those again.
[25:42.480 --> 25:47.040]  I would get rid of them and find something that does not show intersex traits.
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.040]  So the first plan of attack is to get these lights back on 12-12.
[25:51.040 --> 25:55.680]  Your next step is to get rid of that piece of shit timer and get something more reliable.
[25:55.680 --> 25:59.960]  Then you have to pay close attention to these plants throughout the rest of the flowering
[25:59.960 --> 26:01.080]  phase.
[26:01.080 --> 26:05.080]  I'm going to hope that you don't see any hermaphrodite flowers pop up.
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.900]  If you do, you have got to re-strategize at that point and consider your options.
[26:09.900 --> 26:11.600]  Do you cut the flowers out?
[26:11.600 --> 26:12.720]  Do you cut the buds out?
[26:12.720 --> 26:13.840]  Do you cut the branch out?
[26:13.840 --> 26:15.400]  Do you cut the plant out?
[26:15.400 --> 26:19.760]  Or do you ignore it and let it grow like business as usual?
[26:19.760 --> 26:21.920]  Hopefully you learned something from this.
[26:21.920 --> 26:23.680]  Hopefully you've already replaced that timer.
[26:23.680 --> 26:27.600]  And hopefully everybody listening that has one of those piece of shit tab timers is jumping
[26:27.600 --> 26:31.160]  on Amazon and replacing it with something digital right now.
