[00:14.720 --> 00:17.440]  Welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:17.440 --> 00:19.240]  It's time for episode number 227
[00:19.240 --> 00:21.160]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.160 --> 00:24.760]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.920]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:25.920 --> 00:27.240]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.240 --> 00:29.560]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.560 --> 00:31.040]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:31.040 --> 00:32.440]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:32.440 --> 00:34.200]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.200 --> 00:37.200]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.200 --> 00:39.120]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.120 --> 00:40.920]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:40.920 --> 00:43.040]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.040 --> 00:44.640]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:44.640 --> 00:46.960]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.760]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot,
[00:48.760 --> 00:50.720]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.400 --> 00:54.120]  I did it, Mike, I made it all the way through the intro
[00:54.120 --> 00:56.280]  without a cough, without a wheeze, without a sneeze.
[00:56.280 --> 00:57.560]  Well done, sir.
[00:57.560 --> 00:58.480]  Oh, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:58.480 --> 00:59.560]  welcome to the show, White Mike.
[00:59.560 --> 01:00.480]  Mike is back.
[01:00.480 --> 01:01.520]  What's up, everybody?
[01:01.520 --> 01:02.560]  How you doing today, bro?
[01:02.560 --> 01:03.560]  Doing great.
[01:03.560 --> 01:05.320]  Doing very well, man.
[01:05.320 --> 01:07.760]  Can we announce your new situation on the show here?
[01:07.760 --> 01:08.600]  Can we talk about that?
[01:08.600 --> 01:09.640]  I should've asked you first, I guess.
[01:09.640 --> 01:10.800]  We can do a little bit.
[01:10.840 --> 01:13.640]  Yeah, so most of you folks probably know
[01:13.640 --> 01:15.200]  that I am the lead cultivator.
[01:15.200 --> 01:18.160]  I am the cult leader at Three Rivers Cultivation.
[01:19.360 --> 01:21.760]  And now Mike is officially on board.
[01:21.760 --> 01:24.160]  He is part of the Three Rivers Cultivation team.
[01:24.160 --> 01:25.000]  I'm part of the team now.
[01:25.000 --> 01:25.840]  Part of the cult.
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.680]  Thanks for joining the cult with us.
[01:26.680 --> 01:27.520]  You drank the Kool-Aid.
[01:27.520 --> 01:29.280]  This is the only place that's getting announced too,
[01:29.280 --> 01:30.720]  so feel special for hearing that.
[01:30.720 --> 01:33.400]  Yeah, this is the official announcement.
[01:34.600 --> 01:37.440]  If you wanna stalk Mike on the social medias,
[01:37.440 --> 01:40.560]  you should follow him at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[01:41.320 --> 01:42.960]  And you should also check out his Facebook page.
[01:42.960 --> 01:45.040]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:45.040 --> 01:46.000]  Well done, sir.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.240]  Yeah, see, I tried to do a decent intro for my guys.
[01:48.240 --> 01:49.840]  Yeah, you got a point.
[01:49.840 --> 01:53.320]  Mike posts a whole bunch of great cannabis-related news
[01:53.320 --> 01:54.360]  and information.
[01:55.480 --> 01:58.840]  There are several Facebook pages that are cannabis haters,
[01:58.840 --> 02:01.240]  and they like to post a bunch of bullshit.
[02:01.240 --> 02:02.600]  And Mike only posts the truth.
[02:02.600 --> 02:05.480]  I support 99% of what Mike posts.
[02:05.480 --> 02:09.040]  And what I don't agree with is just opinionated stuff
[02:09.080 --> 02:11.200]  from other writers having opinions on things.
[02:11.200 --> 02:13.320]  The science and the facts and the politics,
[02:13.320 --> 02:14.640]  I fucking agree.
[02:14.640 --> 02:17.560]  It's fun, because I get hate on that page
[02:17.560 --> 02:19.960]  from both sides of the cannabis argument.
[02:19.960 --> 02:22.000]  I get activists that are upset
[02:22.000 --> 02:24.480]  that I won't post their latest meme.
[02:24.480 --> 02:28.080]  And I get anti-pop people pissed that I exist at all
[02:28.080 --> 02:30.400]  and keep debunking their bullshit.
[02:30.400 --> 02:33.960]  The meme game is a whole different, that's middle school.
[02:33.960 --> 02:37.400]  And we're trying to play college-level cannabis politics here.
[02:37.560 --> 02:41.480]  Articulate the argument is sort of the page's basic concept.
[02:41.480 --> 02:42.800]  I'm gonna go ahead and fade that music out.
[02:42.800 --> 02:44.040]  It's awkward when it's that low.
[02:44.040 --> 02:45.360]  Bring it down.
[02:45.360 --> 02:46.360]  Fade it out.
[02:46.360 --> 02:47.680]  You've been listening to the beautiful sounds
[02:47.680 --> 02:49.080]  of Mystic Roots.
[02:50.880 --> 02:53.000]  Relax to the mellow sounds of the rain.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.800]  So let me do a little correction.
[02:54.800 --> 02:57.400]  On the last episode, there's a group called PL Grow
[02:57.400 --> 02:59.760]  that's gonna send me a test item.
[02:59.760 --> 03:01.920]  They've got a product for me to review.
[03:01.920 --> 03:03.080]  They haven't quite gotten it to me yet.
[03:03.080 --> 03:04.440]  I've been in contact with them.
[03:04.440 --> 03:05.280]  I fucked up, you guys.
[03:05.280 --> 03:07.200]  I said they are from Australia.
[03:08.000 --> 03:08.920]  They are not from Australia.
[03:08.920 --> 03:10.080]  They're from the UK.
[03:10.080 --> 03:11.280]  So correction.
[03:12.280 --> 03:13.400]  Important correction.
[03:13.400 --> 03:14.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:14.240 --> 03:15.720]  I just gotta rep the right people.
[03:15.720 --> 03:16.560]  I felt bad.
[03:16.560 --> 03:18.080]  They emailed me, they're like, just one small thing.
[03:18.080 --> 03:19.160]  We're from the UK.
[03:19.160 --> 03:20.800]  We're not from Australia.
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.520]  So yeah, big shout out to them.
[03:22.520 --> 03:24.000]  Yeah, I apologize, you guys.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.200]  And now you got two shout outs on the show
[03:26.200 --> 03:29.240]  instead of just one because I made a mistake.
[03:29.240 --> 03:30.240]  All right, so.
[03:31.720 --> 03:33.560]  Gosh, Mike, I don't know what happened, dude.
[03:33.560 --> 03:36.160]  Mike went down to go smoke a cigarette before the podcast.
[03:36.160 --> 03:37.760]  And while he was out there, I just started coughing.
[03:37.760 --> 03:39.560]  My throat just started acting like,
[03:39.560 --> 03:41.200]  and my lungs started juicing up on me.
[03:41.200 --> 03:42.040]  I'm like, what the hell happened?
[03:42.040 --> 03:43.040]  When we were dabbing before the show,
[03:43.040 --> 03:45.520]  my traditional cough didn't really materialize.
[03:45.520 --> 03:46.640]  Did you get it?
[03:46.640 --> 03:48.160]  I may have taken your cough.
[03:48.160 --> 03:50.920]  I may have a sympathy cough for you.
[03:50.920 --> 03:51.880]  Is that possible?
[03:51.880 --> 03:53.000]  Is that a real thing?
[03:53.000 --> 03:54.160]  Dabs are magic, bro.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.360]  Magic sympathy dab cough.
[03:56.360 --> 03:57.200]  I took plenty of dabs.
[03:57.200 --> 03:58.320]  Maybe I had a delayed cough.
[03:58.320 --> 04:00.120]  I was smoking some of the, what did I have?
[04:00.120 --> 04:03.280]  The Killer Queen high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[04:04.120 --> 04:04.960]  Yeah.
[04:04.960 --> 04:05.800]  So we were dabbing, whatever it was,
[04:06.440 --> 04:07.280]  it was really tasty.
[04:07.280 --> 04:09.000]  It made me dabbed out, but after a couple of minutes,
[04:09.000 --> 04:10.600]  it just made me start like, ugh.
[04:11.720 --> 04:13.000]  He starts eating the banger
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.920]  and immediately the room smelled delicious.
[04:14.920 --> 04:17.120]  That's because I've been smoking,
[04:17.120 --> 04:19.280]  the beautiful Miss Jenny Beth went to Apothecary
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.400]  and she got some of the Clementine.
[04:22.400 --> 04:23.560]  She got the, I don't remember,
[04:23.560 --> 04:26.040]  I think she had the high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[04:26.040 --> 04:28.640]  And I picked up some of the high terp full spectrum extract.
[04:28.640 --> 04:30.800]  So we were tag team dabbing each other.
[04:30.800 --> 04:33.160]  And then we went a little hard on the terps
[04:33.160 --> 04:34.560]  and put it in the nail.
[04:34.560 --> 04:36.600]  And it just tastes like that forever.
[04:36.600 --> 04:37.920]  And then I've been pouring a lot of the,
[04:37.920 --> 04:39.640]  I've got these little Lemon Jeffrey high terpene
[04:39.640 --> 04:41.040]  full spectrum extract.
[04:41.040 --> 04:42.320]  That's the flavor.
[04:42.320 --> 04:43.160]  Is that what's in there?
[04:43.160 --> 04:44.520]  I just pour this in there, dude.
[04:44.520 --> 04:46.020]  I just pour these little things like,
[04:46.020 --> 04:47.520]  but two, maybe three or four drops,
[04:47.520 --> 04:48.960]  depending on where I'm trying to go.
[04:48.960 --> 04:51.480]  Just a small dab and four drops of this.
[04:51.480 --> 04:52.760]  And dude, you just blow clouds.
[04:52.760 --> 04:54.760]  And there's something in these little terps right here.
[04:54.760 --> 04:56.520]  The dudes, there's cannabinoids in this.
[04:56.520 --> 04:59.680]  It's not just pure terps, but it's mostly terps.
[04:59.680 --> 05:02.640]  Terps have a lot to do with where the high goes.
[05:02.640 --> 05:03.920]  Absolutely.
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.960]  I think the THC makes you go, it makes you go up.
[05:08.960 --> 05:11.600]  And then the terps decide if you get the munchies,
[05:11.600 --> 05:13.260]  if you get an eye high, if you get creative,
[05:13.260 --> 05:15.920]  if you want to do the dishes, if you get panicky.
[05:15.920 --> 05:17.440]  I think the terps are all about.
[05:17.440 --> 05:18.320]  Pain relief.
[05:18.320 --> 05:19.160]  Pain relief, okay.
[05:19.160 --> 05:21.240]  You think the terps have a lot to do with the pain relief.
[05:21.240 --> 05:23.640]  A bunch of different stuff that the terps are affecting.
[05:23.640 --> 05:26.840]  It's not just fun aspects of the high.
[05:26.840 --> 05:29.040]  It's medical aspects of it too.
[05:29.040 --> 05:29.880]  All right.
[05:29.880 --> 05:32.800]  I think the limonene, which is what this is mainly.
[05:32.840 --> 05:34.000]  That's my personal take.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.600]  I feel like the, so I talk about it way too much
[05:36.600 --> 05:37.420]  on the show.
[05:37.420 --> 05:38.260]  I've got a brain injury.
[05:38.260 --> 05:42.120]  Sometimes it feels like my brain skips like an old CD.
[05:42.120 --> 05:42.960]  And I can feel it.
[05:42.960 --> 05:45.480]  It just fucking, the song will be played.
[05:45.480 --> 05:47.040]  Remember when you had a Discman?
[05:47.040 --> 05:51.560]  A lot of people are going, what?
[05:51.560 --> 05:53.340]  Remember CDs, you guys, back in the day?
[05:53.340 --> 05:54.880]  These silver shiny things?
[05:54.880 --> 05:56.640]  So a lot of those used to skip.
[05:56.640 --> 05:58.560]  And it would sound like this.
[05:58.560 --> 06:03.560]  Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[06:05.000 --> 06:06.800]  Sometimes my brain does the part
[06:06.800 --> 06:08.420]  and it's from a fucking traumatic brain injury.
[06:08.420 --> 06:11.440]  There's a dent in my brain where information skips.
[06:11.440 --> 06:12.280]  I don't know.
[06:12.280 --> 06:13.120]  It just falls out sometimes.
[06:13.120 --> 06:14.880]  And there it goes.
[06:14.880 --> 06:16.000]  And it seems like dumb shit
[06:16.000 --> 06:17.880]  that I don't really need to remember is what left.
[06:17.880 --> 06:20.160]  A lot of the important shit has been coming back.
[06:20.160 --> 06:22.320]  But I feel like the limonene puts a little patch
[06:22.320 --> 06:23.160]  in the divot.
[06:23.160 --> 06:24.200]  It puts some Bondo in the brain dent
[06:24.200 --> 06:26.440]  and it helps that the bridge that got broken.
[06:26.440 --> 06:28.280]  It helps it reconnect.
[06:29.040 --> 06:30.740]  When I get the black cherry flavor,
[06:32.480 --> 06:35.720]  I know that along with that flavor,
[06:35.720 --> 06:38.440]  I'm going to get a really nice hit of pain relief
[06:38.440 --> 06:40.680]  in about four to eight minutes.
[06:40.680 --> 06:45.200]  And it's part that cannabinoid
[06:45.200 --> 06:47.280]  that's really helping with the pain relief.
[06:47.280 --> 06:48.120]  The CBD?
[06:48.120 --> 06:49.800]  CBD, I'm sorry, I'm frying.
[06:49.800 --> 06:51.680]  Yeah, I can tell when you can't think about CBD.
[06:51.680 --> 06:55.320]  I'm looking at new lights flashing on the board across
[06:55.320 --> 06:57.280]  for me and I got distracted and dabbed out.
[06:57.280 --> 06:58.120]  Sorry, folks.
[06:58.960 --> 06:59.800]  With the iPads, you can't see the screen also.
[06:59.800 --> 07:01.800]  But CBD and then common terpenes
[07:01.800 --> 07:05.520]  that you find alongside CBD that add that flavor to it.
[07:06.760 --> 07:09.560]  My tongue knows that when that hits,
[07:09.560 --> 07:12.120]  my eyes light up and I start looking for where it came from
[07:12.120 --> 07:13.160]  and where I can get more of it.
[07:13.160 --> 07:15.600]  I did an episode a while back called Follow Your Nose
[07:15.600 --> 07:20.440]  because I believe that your body and your nose know
[07:20.440 --> 07:21.480]  what's best for you.
[07:21.480 --> 07:23.480]  That's why oranges smell.
[07:23.480 --> 07:24.760]  And I said this in the other episode.
[07:24.760 --> 07:26.120]  I'm just repeating myself at this point.
[07:26.160 --> 07:27.720]  But that's why I said oranges smell good
[07:27.720 --> 07:28.760]  and shit smells bad.
[07:28.760 --> 07:30.080]  You're supposed to eat oranges.
[07:30.080 --> 07:31.320]  Oranges make you feel good.
[07:31.320 --> 07:32.880]  They have vitamin C, they have natural sugar,
[07:32.880 --> 07:34.720]  there's fiber, there's other stuff in there.
[07:34.720 --> 07:36.000]  I don't know if there's fiber in there,
[07:36.000 --> 07:37.360]  but I assume there'd be fiber and calcium
[07:37.360 --> 07:38.200]  in a goddamn orange.
[07:38.200 --> 07:39.920]  Shit, you're not supposed to eat that.
[07:39.920 --> 07:40.800]  That's why it smells bad.
[07:40.800 --> 07:41.760]  There's shit in there.
[07:41.760 --> 07:42.760]  It's already been done.
[07:42.760 --> 07:46.720]  There's a reason 99% of people salivate
[07:46.720 --> 07:48.560]  when they smell meat over fire.
[07:48.560 --> 07:49.400]  Yeah.
[07:49.400 --> 07:51.600]  That's how people didn't die of starvation
[07:51.600 --> 07:53.200]  for most of our history.
[07:53.200 --> 07:56.040]  A thing in your brain that goes, oh yeah.
[07:56.880 --> 07:58.600]  Same thing with fresh fruit.
[07:58.600 --> 08:00.040]  When you're in a supermarket
[08:00.040 --> 08:01.280]  and you're just a little bit hungry
[08:01.280 --> 08:03.080]  and you get hit with that fresh fruit smell,
[08:03.080 --> 08:04.560]  like off the oranges for me.
[08:04.560 --> 08:05.760]  Yep, I was just saying oranges.
[08:05.760 --> 08:06.880]  I stare at them and I'm like,
[08:06.880 --> 08:09.080]  all right, now I have to buy four.
[08:09.080 --> 08:11.240]  That doesn't happen so much with the pears for me.
[08:11.240 --> 08:12.840]  Miss Jenny Beth, she loves oranges.
[08:12.840 --> 08:14.080]  Oranges is her terp.
[08:14.080 --> 08:15.680]  That's the one that fixes her,
[08:17.080 --> 08:19.080]  that's her medical and her recreational smoke.
[08:19.080 --> 08:21.000]  My kid goes mad for citrus.
[08:21.000 --> 08:21.840]  Anything citrus.
[08:21.840 --> 08:23.480]  I love the lemon terps.
[08:23.480 --> 08:25.160]  My friend Kelly, she doesn't smoke cannabis.
[08:25.200 --> 08:26.440]  I'll tell you Matt Kelly,
[08:26.440 --> 08:27.960]  she doesn't consume cannabis,
[08:27.960 --> 08:29.800]  but she hates the smell of oranges.
[08:29.800 --> 08:32.520]  She's like orange anything, I can't stand it.
[08:32.520 --> 08:35.480]  So I'm curious, lavender is what she likes.
[08:35.480 --> 08:37.760]  She told me that lavender and lilacs are her type of thing,
[08:37.760 --> 08:40.840]  which is really funny because lilacs and lavender
[08:40.840 --> 08:42.880]  make me feel like I inhaled something.
[08:42.880 --> 08:44.080]  I feel particles.
[08:44.080 --> 08:45.280]  I like all three of those.
[08:45.280 --> 08:48.120]  Yeah, lilacs and lavender are not for me.
[08:48.120 --> 08:49.760]  Yep, but the two don't make me hungry.
[08:49.760 --> 08:51.400]  And the third one does.
[08:51.400 --> 08:54.800]  They're supposed to be calming and relaxing smells.
[08:55.440 --> 08:56.640]  And they honestly just bother the fuck out of me.
[08:56.640 --> 08:58.480]  I'm not a calm and relaxed person.
[08:58.480 --> 09:00.560]  My whole house reeks of lavender,
[09:00.560 --> 09:02.920]  like constantly we use it on everything.
[09:04.040 --> 09:05.760]  All right, I won't be there.
[09:07.640 --> 09:09.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I do have a podcast planned,
[09:09.640 --> 09:10.480]  but when Mike comes.
[09:10.480 --> 09:11.800]  I do like it when we're around.
[09:11.800 --> 09:13.880]  I love the comfort of when you just show up, bro.
[09:13.880 --> 09:15.400]  It's fun working with you now.
[09:15.400 --> 09:17.520]  This wasn't a planned show necessarily.
[09:17.520 --> 09:20.200]  It was we both finally found 45 free minutes.
[09:20.200 --> 09:21.040]  Yeah, yeah.
[09:21.040 --> 09:22.040]  I was like, bro, what are you doing tonight?
[09:22.040 --> 09:23.200]  And he's like, I don't know, podcast.
[09:23.200 --> 09:24.240]  I was like, yes, come over.
[09:24.680 --> 09:25.520]  And so he called me and he's here.
[09:25.520 --> 09:27.720]  Dude, thanks for taking time away from the kid.
[09:27.720 --> 09:28.560]  Yeah.
[09:28.560 --> 09:29.400]  And the wife also.
[09:29.400 --> 09:30.240]  Shout out to Jen.
[09:30.240 --> 09:31.760]  I know you don't listen, but hey, shout out wife.
[09:31.760 --> 09:33.120]  Hey, baby.
[09:33.120 --> 09:37.360]  So let's move on to some shit on a podcast, bro.
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.080]  We promised them a show.
[09:39.080 --> 09:41.720]  Let's talk about some stuff.
[09:41.720 --> 09:43.720]  Okay, so somebody the other day,
[09:43.720 --> 09:45.720]  a friend of mine is building a grow.
[09:45.720 --> 09:49.560]  And he was like, so Rasta Jeff, what is the secret weapon?
[09:49.560 --> 09:52.360]  Is there a magic bullet for my grow that I can buy
[09:52.360 --> 09:55.160]  that will give me the highest THC, the best flavor,
[09:55.160 --> 09:56.640]  the biggest yields?
[09:56.640 --> 09:57.880]  What can I buy?
[09:57.880 --> 10:00.200]  Okay, so my answer is yes.
[10:00.200 --> 10:02.760]  And I have a specific reason and a specific bullet.
[10:02.760 --> 10:03.600]  Okay.
[10:03.600 --> 10:04.440]  What's your answer?
[10:04.440 --> 10:05.260]  Well, I want to hear yours
[10:05.260 --> 10:07.040]  because I get to talk a lot on a show.
[10:07.040 --> 10:08.920]  100% yes, there's a magic bullet.
[10:08.920 --> 10:10.280]  It's a fucking grow book.
[10:11.160 --> 10:13.480]  Go buy the grow book, read the grow book.
[10:13.480 --> 10:14.600]  That's your silver bullet.
[10:14.600 --> 10:15.760]  Well, there goes the episode I wrote.
[10:15.760 --> 10:17.160]  I'm fucking, we're done.
[10:17.160 --> 10:19.080]  Take a fad dab, give your mama a hug for me.
[10:19.080 --> 10:21.480]  There's a reason that's the only silver bullet.
[10:23.360 --> 10:24.200]  I think I'm high.
[10:24.200 --> 10:25.040]  You need to, you,
[10:25.040 --> 10:25.960]  I'm giddy, this was fun.
[10:25.960 --> 10:29.560]  If you've never grown cannabis before,
[10:29.560 --> 10:31.400]  you don't know what you're getting into.
[10:31.400 --> 10:33.240]  You don't know what the parameters are.
[10:33.240 --> 10:36.560]  You don't know what its needs are
[10:36.560 --> 10:38.840]  and are going to be down the line
[10:38.840 --> 10:41.240]  as it progresses through its life cycle.
[10:41.240 --> 10:42.080]  Well, he's got,
[10:42.080 --> 10:44.080]  And the easiest way to get that shit figured out
[10:44.080 --> 10:47.720]  and get going successfully is to go to a bookstore,
[10:47.720 --> 10:51.360]  pick out any grow book on the shelf, buy it and read it.
[10:51.360 --> 10:54.120]  This guy's got two or three of the best cannabis growers
[10:54.120 --> 10:55.120]  as teachers.
[10:55.960 --> 10:57.680]  I'm one of his teachers.
[10:57.680 --> 10:59.160]  He sees me on a daily basis.
[10:59.160 --> 11:01.720]  He's got another guy that is a very good teacher
[11:01.720 --> 11:04.160]  that's been to his grow also and will help him out.
[11:04.160 --> 11:05.960]  But he was, and you're right, Mike,
[11:05.960 --> 11:07.040]  you're fucking so right.
[11:07.040 --> 11:08.480]  I can't believe I didn't tell him,
[11:08.480 --> 11:10.360]  yes, go buy a damn grow book, dude.
[11:10.360 --> 11:13.680]  But I was like, no, honestly, there is no one magic bullet.
[11:13.680 --> 11:16.120]  He thought that if he bought a specific light
[11:16.120 --> 11:17.040]  that he would do it.
[11:17.040 --> 11:18.400]  He thought that maybe I could tell him,
[11:18.400 --> 11:20.640]  buy this bottle and it would do it.
[11:20.640 --> 11:23.400]  But I had to tell him there's no secret weapon, dude.
[11:23.400 --> 11:24.320]  There's no ninja sword.
[11:24.320 --> 11:26.760]  There's no, you can't just get one thing.
[11:26.760 --> 11:28.800]  What I had to explain to him was,
[11:28.800 --> 11:30.080]  and this is just my opinion.
[11:30.080 --> 11:32.120]  The grow book is the secret weapon, you guys.
[11:32.120 --> 11:33.400]  To everything, knowledge is key.
[11:33.400 --> 11:35.040]  So go get yourself a grow book.
[11:35.040 --> 11:38.080]  I recommend, there's an Ed Rosenthal book.
[11:38.080 --> 11:39.940]  It's the Oakster Damn Course Guide.
[11:39.940 --> 11:41.280]  I highly recommend that book.
[11:41.280 --> 11:42.440]  That is a good book.
[11:42.440 --> 11:44.640]  The problem with the grow book is like every six months,
[11:44.640 --> 11:45.560]  they're fucking outdated.
[11:45.560 --> 11:46.720]  That's why I do a podcast.
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.160]  Well, the nice thing about any grow guide,
[11:51.160 --> 11:52.960]  I mean, even some of the more advanced ones,
[11:52.960 --> 11:57.960]  the more topical ones, they're gonna cover the basics.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.800]  And I mean, it's like anything.
[11:59.800 --> 12:02.000]  There is an advanced class.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.280]  Knowing a lot more will produce
[12:04.280 --> 12:05.840]  significantly better results.
[12:05.840 --> 12:08.600]  But if you know the basic rules of the game,
[12:08.600 --> 12:11.640]  you can take your ass to any fucking field and play.
[12:11.640 --> 12:15.040]  And if you sit down and read any grow book,
[12:15.040 --> 12:18.760]  it's gonna lay out, here's the A, B, C, D, E,
[12:18.760 --> 12:23.320]  basic level one checklist that you need to go through.
[12:23.320 --> 12:26.360]  Here's what you need to know super basic about lighting.
[12:26.360 --> 12:29.200]  Here's what you need to know super basic about feeding.
[12:30.120 --> 12:31.960]  Light and dark periods.
[12:31.960 --> 12:33.040]  Harvesting.
[12:33.880 --> 12:36.840]  Here's a small list of common pitfalls
[12:36.840 --> 12:38.680]  that people fall into to look out for.
[12:38.680 --> 12:40.720]  All right, so you actually just nailed a couple of things
[12:40.720 --> 12:43.120]  that I was gonna mention to the person
[12:43.120 --> 12:44.880]  that asked me this question.
[12:45.720 --> 12:46.560]  Basically what I told him was
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.640]  there's no magic secret weapon, it's everything.
[12:48.640 --> 12:50.680]  Everything is what matters the most.
[12:50.680 --> 12:52.320]  You have to dial in everything.
[12:52.320 --> 12:53.800]  The plants start at a 10.
[12:53.800 --> 12:55.800]  The plants start at their highest potential.
[12:55.800 --> 12:56.960]  They are 10s.
[12:56.960 --> 12:59.640]  And basically we fuck them up by limiting them.
[12:59.640 --> 13:02.720]  So you have to find out how to limit them
[13:02.720 --> 13:06.000]  and get out of their way as much as you can.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.720]  And I wrote down LAWS,
[13:07.720 --> 13:09.920]  LAWS is something that every grower should know about.
[13:09.920 --> 13:11.960]  It's lights, air, water, and soil.
[13:11.960 --> 13:14.280]  Those are the main things you need to worry about.
[13:14.280 --> 13:16.600]  You have to have the best lighting you can get.
[13:17.480 --> 13:19.880]  And I know I just said you have to have the best you can get.
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.520]  Put the best lighting you can afford and maintain
[13:24.520 --> 13:26.000]  in your grow space, yes.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.280]  If you've got a small space,
[13:27.280 --> 13:29.800]  don't put a 2000 watt fucking setup in there.
[13:29.800 --> 13:32.000]  If you've got a small space, go get yourself a T5,
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.400]  go get yourself a fucking LED and put it in the small space.
[13:35.400 --> 13:38.760]  If you've got big space, put big lights in there.
[13:38.760 --> 13:40.680]  Every time I answer this question,
[13:40.680 --> 13:43.640]  the person I'm talking to seems incredibly hesitant
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.480]  to take the advice of go buy the book
[13:46.480 --> 13:48.400]  because they're excited.
[13:48.400 --> 13:49.520]  It can't be that hard.
[13:49.520 --> 13:50.640]  It's a weed.
[13:50.640 --> 13:53.240]  Your high ass can do it, right?
[13:53.240 --> 13:56.080]  It doesn't seem complicated at the beginning.
[13:56.080 --> 13:59.200]  And honestly, if you could just take the seed
[13:59.200 --> 14:02.120]  you found in your bag out in your backyard
[14:02.120 --> 14:03.640]  and water it with your sprinklers
[14:03.640 --> 14:05.160]  like you do your flower bed
[14:06.680 --> 14:10.920]  and not get robbed and killed or arrested for doing so,
[14:10.920 --> 14:12.480]  it would be a lot simpler.
[14:12.480 --> 14:15.280]  But because you're attempting to take something
[14:15.280 --> 14:18.840]  out of its environment and create an environment
[14:18.840 --> 14:21.120]  where it will thrive artificially,
[14:21.120 --> 14:22.960]  there's some ground rules that you just need
[14:22.960 --> 14:25.040]  to familiarize yourself with.
[14:25.040 --> 14:28.880]  And honestly, until you sit down and write the book,
[14:28.880 --> 14:31.360]  you don't really triple check,
[14:31.360 --> 14:34.240]  am I hitting every point that a new person
[14:34.240 --> 14:37.480]  is gonna need to know to be successful?
[14:37.480 --> 14:39.360]  I went and did a consult for a dude
[14:39.360 --> 14:42.080]  when I was first starting out doing consulting.
[14:42.680 --> 14:44.200]  And I forgot like three important things
[14:44.200 --> 14:45.360]  when I was there the first day
[14:45.360 --> 14:47.440]  that I didn't think about till I got home.
[14:47.440 --> 14:48.800]  And I sent the dude a long email.
[14:48.800 --> 14:49.920]  I was like, dude, I'm really sorry,
[14:49.920 --> 14:52.320]  but this, this, and this.
[14:52.320 --> 14:54.440]  Don't know why that didn't occur to me yesterday.
[14:54.440 --> 14:57.480]  Really sorry I didn't include all of this information
[14:57.480 --> 14:59.000]  during your physical consult.
[15:00.080 --> 15:02.360]  Feel free to ask me more questions over email.
[15:02.360 --> 15:04.720]  Sorry, bro, not driving back to North Glen.
[15:04.720 --> 15:05.880]  Oh man, North Glen.
[15:07.160 --> 15:08.840]  But it just happens.
[15:08.840 --> 15:11.600]  When you get to the point of publishing a grow guide,
[15:12.120 --> 15:13.720]  you and a couple other growers have gone over
[15:13.720 --> 15:15.680]  and been like, yep, bro, you hit all the steps.
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.040]  That's how you go from the dugout to home plate.
[15:19.040 --> 15:20.340]  Right, but once you got the book,
[15:20.340 --> 15:21.520]  you still gotta worry about,
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.840]  you've got the grow built,
[15:22.840 --> 15:24.960]  and now your plants are growing.
[15:24.960 --> 15:27.180]  And you still can't just buy one thing
[15:27.180 --> 15:28.020]  to put in that grow.
[15:28.020 --> 15:29.360]  You've gotta get good lights.
[15:29.360 --> 15:30.240]  And then you gotta get,
[15:30.240 --> 15:32.240]  I recommend the Govitas if you've got a big space.
[15:32.240 --> 15:33.180]  If you've got a little space,
[15:33.180 --> 15:35.680]  get the Govita 750s or the 650s.
[15:35.680 --> 15:37.720]  And then just work your way down based on your space.
[15:37.720 --> 15:39.440]  Then you need good nutrients.
[15:39.440 --> 15:40.640]  If you don't have,
[15:40.640 --> 15:42.480]  and there's no magic nutrients you can buy.
[15:42.480 --> 15:43.600]  You gotta do the research,
[15:43.600 --> 15:44.680]  and you gotta find,
[15:44.680 --> 15:46.480]  figure out if you wanna use organic.
[15:46.480 --> 15:48.240]  Figure out if you wanna use non-organic.
[15:48.240 --> 15:51.320]  Figure out, it's up to you how you wanna do it.
[15:51.320 --> 15:53.560]  And it's all, the more non-organic,
[15:53.560 --> 15:55.300]  and this may, a lot of people are gonna argue with me,
[15:55.300 --> 15:56.140]  but this is my opinion.
[15:56.140 --> 15:58.120]  The more non-organic you go,
[15:58.120 --> 15:59.400]  the more bottle-based you get,
[15:59.400 --> 16:00.840]  the more simple it is.
[16:00.840 --> 16:02.520]  But when you work more towards the organics,
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.840]  there's a little more work to it,
[16:03.840 --> 16:06.440]  but it's also a little more pleasing product
[16:06.440 --> 16:09.080]  to some people to know it's all organic.
[16:09.800 --> 16:12.280]  Mike just gave me kind of a look.
[16:12.280 --> 16:13.880]  I know a couple of organic people
[16:13.880 --> 16:15.360]  that they could spend three years
[16:15.360 --> 16:16.560]  trying to teach me their method,
[16:16.560 --> 16:17.720]  and I'd only know a part of it.
[16:17.720 --> 16:18.560]  Right, right.
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.280]  And I know bottle people the same way.
[16:21.280 --> 16:24.560]  I was just picturing in my head the full advanced line.
[16:24.560 --> 16:26.120]  Oh no, unnecessary, highly unnecessary.
[16:26.120 --> 16:27.200]  Oh no, there's a lot of that shit
[16:27.200 --> 16:28.640]  that's insanely unnecessary.
[16:28.640 --> 16:29.480]  You can do everything
[16:29.480 --> 16:31.480]  what the advanced nutrients line does
[16:31.480 --> 16:35.000]  with Veg Bloom and two or three bottles of extra additives.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.440]  Yep.
[16:36.440 --> 16:38.000]  And this is where taking the time
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.880]  to do a little research and education
[16:40.880 --> 16:42.160]  comes in incredibly handy.
[16:42.160 --> 16:43.680]  Go to the growth store.
[16:43.680 --> 16:45.360]  Ask the person behind the counter lots of questions.
[16:45.360 --> 16:46.920]  Don't even ask the growth store dude.
[16:46.920 --> 16:47.760]  The growth store dude
[16:47.760 --> 16:49.440]  is paid to sell a certain fucking brand.
[16:49.440 --> 16:51.360]  He uses a certain brand.
[16:51.360 --> 16:53.640]  One thing that pisses me off about growth stores,
[16:53.640 --> 16:55.960]  and it also happens at Guitar Center,
[16:55.960 --> 16:57.480]  it happens at Best Buy,
[16:57.480 --> 16:58.480]  you go somewhere,
[16:58.480 --> 17:00.000]  and Guitar Center is fucking notorious for this.
[17:00.000 --> 17:02.240]  You're like, hey, I wanna buy these kind of drumsticks.
[17:02.240 --> 17:03.920]  And the drum guy goes, fuck those sticks, bro.
[17:03.920 --> 17:04.760]  I play these sticks.
[17:04.760 --> 17:06.200]  They're all that fucking matter.
[17:06.200 --> 17:07.840]  And he spins his sticks and flips his hair around
[17:08.680 --> 17:09.520]  like he's cooler than everybody.
[17:09.520 --> 17:11.320]  And I'm like, I don't fucking care about your emo band.
[17:11.320 --> 17:13.160]  I want these sticks I came for.
[17:13.160 --> 17:15.400]  And so I feel like they do the same shit at growth stores.
[17:15.400 --> 17:16.880]  You're like, hey man, I came to buy Botanic.
[17:16.880 --> 17:18.400]  I'm like, fuck Botanicare, bro.
[17:18.400 --> 17:19.440]  I use Psycho, bro.
[17:19.440 --> 17:20.480]  It's all that matters.
[17:20.480 --> 17:22.160]  And they treat you like they're better than you.
[17:22.160 --> 17:23.000]  And I don't like that shit.
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.120]  They push whatever brand
[17:25.120 --> 17:27.560]  whose rep has a special going on that month.
[17:27.560 --> 17:29.720]  Or whichever brand threw them free shit.
[17:29.720 --> 17:30.560]  Yep.
[17:30.560 --> 17:31.840]  Or whichever brand gave them a fucking hat.
[17:31.840 --> 17:32.840]  Or is about to expire.
[17:32.840 --> 17:34.160]  Look and see what shirt they're wearing.
[17:34.160 --> 17:35.320]  And if that's what they're pitching you,
[17:35.320 --> 17:36.640]  I mean, somebody's fucking doing it.
[17:36.640 --> 17:37.480]  It's, yeah.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.400]  So there are plenty of places to do your research
[17:39.400 --> 17:41.920]  on which new line to use and which gear to get.
[17:41.920 --> 17:45.560]  I have been using for years, Botanicare Pure Blend Pro.
[17:45.560 --> 17:46.840]  They've been bought out by a company
[17:46.840 --> 17:48.920]  that I'm not sure I want to support.
[17:48.920 --> 17:51.840]  So when I run out of Botanicare Pure Blend Pro product,
[17:51.840 --> 17:53.360]  Pure Blend Pro products,
[17:53.360 --> 17:55.440]  that's hard as fuck to say when you're as high as I am
[17:55.440 --> 17:57.000]  to tell you the god damn truth.
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.040]  I think I'm going to switch to another brand that is small.
[18:01.040 --> 18:03.160]  And I don't know if I want to say the name of the company
[18:03.160 --> 18:04.440]  on the show right now,
[18:04.440 --> 18:07.080]  because I'm going to switch to New Millennium.
[18:07.680 --> 18:11.600]  I'll be using Veg Bloom base with New Millennium additives
[18:11.600 --> 18:14.680]  and Shine and Plus Life and Mammoth Pea.
[18:14.680 --> 18:17.920]  That's what I plan on switching to in the long run.
[18:17.920 --> 18:19.280]  It'll be a slow process
[18:19.280 --> 18:22.560]  because I've got a lot of Botanicare products left.
[18:22.560 --> 18:23.580]  But once those are gone,
[18:23.580 --> 18:25.520]  it'll be replaced with New Millennium.
[18:26.760 --> 18:28.800]  I was not happy about that purchase either.
[18:28.800 --> 18:29.880]  Yeah, but shit happens.
[18:29.880 --> 18:31.320]  It's big companies and that's going to happen.
[18:31.320 --> 18:33.720]  So I would recommend Veg Bloom is great.
[18:33.720 --> 18:36.640]  If you want something simple, Veg Bloom.
[18:37.160 --> 18:39.000]  I like the Veg Bloom, the one for the dirty.
[18:39.000 --> 18:40.560]  It's called dirty, it's for hard water.
[18:40.560 --> 18:41.800]  Most of you guys probably live in an area
[18:41.800 --> 18:42.960]  where you've got hard water.
[18:42.960 --> 18:43.920]  So you want the dirty.
[18:43.920 --> 18:47.640]  Veg Bloom dirty, add Shine, add Plus Life,
[18:47.640 --> 18:52.560]  spray them with Push, and then maybe add some Mammoth Pea.
[18:52.560 --> 18:55.160]  It's not even necessary if you're using the Plus Life.
[18:55.160 --> 18:56.720]  I was using the Mammoth Pea to start them,
[18:56.720 --> 18:57.960]  to get them going faster.
[18:58.880 --> 19:00.300]  And then maybe something,
[19:00.300 --> 19:02.180]  you might need some Cow Mag in there,
[19:02.180 --> 19:04.020]  maybe a kelp product just to beef them up.
[19:04.020 --> 19:07.100]  But honestly, the Veg Bloom, with the Plus Life,
[19:07.100 --> 19:09.820]  the Shine, and the Push spray,
[19:09.820 --> 19:12.820]  you can get through the whole process with that.
[19:12.820 --> 19:16.940]  If what Jeff said just now didn't make a lot of sense to you,
[19:16.940 --> 19:18.260]  please go buy the book.
[19:18.260 --> 19:20.340]  Or go to the Veg Bloom website.
[19:20.340 --> 19:21.660]  They don't pay me or anything.
[19:21.660 --> 19:23.000]  I just like the Veg Bloom products.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.500]  They're super easy to use and they give great results.
[19:25.500 --> 19:27.180]  And listen to back episodes of the show.
[19:27.180 --> 19:28.700]  For the correct strain.
[19:28.700 --> 19:31.820]  For Kush type strains, Veg Bloom's fucking awesome.
[19:31.820 --> 19:34.420]  For other strains, it doesn't do as well.
[19:34.420 --> 19:36.260]  If you've got like an OG Kush,
[19:36.260 --> 19:37.860]  or a Grateful Dog type of strain,
[19:37.860 --> 19:39.620]  the Veg Bloom will do wonderfully.
[19:39.620 --> 19:42.100]  It felt like I was trying to get at something else.
[19:42.100 --> 19:44.540]  But for certain strains, it'll do a really good job.
[19:44.540 --> 19:45.460]  It's real simple.
[19:45.460 --> 19:46.300]  I don't remember.
[19:46.300 --> 19:47.140]  There's something else I was gonna say on there.
[19:47.140 --> 19:50.020]  But I was gonna say to go to hydroponicresearch.com.
[19:50.020 --> 19:52.220]  Hydroponic-research.com.
[19:52.220 --> 19:53.740]  That's the Veg Bloom website.
[19:53.740 --> 19:54.820]  All their information's there.
[19:54.820 --> 19:56.180]  There'll be feed charts.
[19:56.180 --> 19:57.020]  It's real easy.
[19:57.020 --> 19:59.820]  Just there's fucking three dry products
[19:59.820 --> 20:00.940]  and a foliar spray.
[20:00.940 --> 20:01.980]  Super simple.
[20:01.980 --> 20:03.500]  All right, I'm gonna quit pitching Veg Bloom.
[20:03.500 --> 20:04.340]  They're not paying me.
[20:04.340 --> 20:05.420]  So you got good nutrients.
[20:05.420 --> 20:06.980]  You have to get your pH dialed in.
[20:06.980 --> 20:09.020]  You have to find out what pH those plants like.
[20:09.020 --> 20:11.620]  Start at six five and see what's happening with your plants.
[20:11.620 --> 20:14.540]  Learn how to identify pH problems.
[20:14.540 --> 20:16.820]  Raise them up or down if you need to.
[20:16.820 --> 20:19.220]  I hardly ever check the pH of my soil.
[20:19.220 --> 20:21.180]  I haven't ever checked the pH of the soil
[20:21.180 --> 20:22.020]  in the fucking commercial.
[20:22.020 --> 20:22.900]  We're using cocoa.
[20:22.900 --> 20:24.600]  I've never checked the pH of the cocoa
[20:24.600 --> 20:25.440]  at the commercial grow.
[20:25.440 --> 20:26.740]  I check the runoff.
[20:26.740 --> 20:29.460]  I check the pH of the runoff and I check the EC,
[20:29.500 --> 20:31.260]  the electrical conductivity of the runoff,
[20:31.260 --> 20:33.740]  but I do not check the fucking cocoa itself.
[20:33.740 --> 20:35.180]  I can tell what's going on by what goes in
[20:35.180 --> 20:36.340]  and what comes out.
[20:36.340 --> 20:38.540]  Another thing you gotta keep in mind is the CO2.
[20:38.540 --> 20:40.500]  You guys are augmenting CO2.
[20:40.500 --> 20:42.380]  You can give it a lot of CO2.
[20:42.380 --> 20:45.900]  The natural environment rocks around 400 ppms of CO2.
[20:45.900 --> 20:47.020]  Depends on where you are.
[20:47.020 --> 20:48.660]  These plants can take,
[20:48.660 --> 20:52.740]  I've seen people push them up to the 2200 ppms of car lot.
[20:52.740 --> 20:54.300]  A lot of people run around 15.
[20:54.300 --> 20:56.660]  Yeah, we rock about 1500 at the big grow,
[20:56.660 --> 20:58.340]  but you can push them.
[20:58.340 --> 21:00.140]  Temperatures, you've gotta dial in temperatures.
[21:00.140 --> 21:01.260]  Do you have temperature swings?
[21:01.260 --> 21:02.260]  Is it too hot during the day?
[21:02.260 --> 21:03.360]  Is it too cold during the night?
[21:03.360 --> 21:05.380]  Is it too hot during the night, too cold during the day?
[21:05.380 --> 21:07.500]  Any of that is gonna fuck with your plant.
[21:07.500 --> 21:09.300]  So there's no one magic thing so far.
[21:09.300 --> 21:11.500]  I've already read off like a list of seven or eight things.
[21:11.500 --> 21:13.820]  Moisture in the soil, moisture in the room,
[21:13.820 --> 21:16.220]  floor temperature, leaf surface temperature.
[21:16.220 --> 21:17.620]  Dude, floor temperature.
[21:17.620 --> 21:21.420]  I got a tour of a major facility not that long ago.
[21:21.420 --> 21:24.060]  Plants on concrete in February, bitches.
[21:24.060 --> 21:25.940]  Yeah, you can't do that in Colorado.
[21:26.780 --> 21:27.620]  Take off your shoes and walk around.
[21:27.620 --> 21:30.020]  Just walk around on the concrete.
[21:30.020 --> 21:31.940]  The first time I saw that in a
[21:31.940 --> 21:34.020]  how to build your grow room video,
[21:34.020 --> 21:36.460]  dude, in the video is he's showing people
[21:36.460 --> 21:37.900]  how to build his little room in Amsterdam,
[21:37.900 --> 21:41.020]  bust his shoes and socks off and walks around on the floor
[21:41.020 --> 21:42.860]  and he's like, this is way too cold.
[21:42.860 --> 21:45.820]  And he goes and installs some pads on the floor.
[21:45.820 --> 21:46.660]  Yeah.
[21:46.660 --> 21:47.980]  And I just rocked my world.
[21:47.980 --> 21:51.540]  I never would have thought of that before, but huge effect.
[21:51.540 --> 21:53.580]  You've got these pots filled with dirt and roots
[21:53.580 --> 21:54.900]  and then you're gonna pour water into it
[21:54.900 --> 21:55.860]  and it's gonna get cold.
[21:56.700 --> 21:57.900]  It's ice cold on that floor.
[21:57.900 --> 21:59.780]  And if you're in a warehouse or a basement,
[21:59.780 --> 22:02.020]  it's gonna get chilly, super chilly.
[22:03.780 --> 22:06.220]  The acronym you gave out earlier,
[22:06.220 --> 22:09.860]  I like that the four points that it hit
[22:09.860 --> 22:12.260]  and I liked that it spelled out LAWS.
[22:12.260 --> 22:15.700]  Because that's the one thing we didn't bring up so far
[22:15.700 --> 22:18.100]  in shit you should take a minute to look up
[22:18.100 --> 22:20.660]  if you wanna be successful growing.
[22:20.660 --> 22:24.740]  Dude, the local laws, you're gonna wanna know those.
[22:24.860 --> 22:26.340]  They're gonna apply.
[22:26.340 --> 22:27.620]  They're gonna impact you.
[22:29.020 --> 22:30.340]  We live in a legal state.
[22:30.340 --> 22:32.380]  It's totally legal to grow here.
[22:32.380 --> 22:34.020]  The smell of marijuana is no longer
[22:34.020 --> 22:35.980]  a probable cause in Colorado.
[22:35.980 --> 22:38.340]  I had cops pounding on my door,
[22:38.340 --> 22:40.720]  wondering if I knew my neighbor
[22:40.720 --> 22:43.180]  because they thought he was growing
[22:43.180 --> 22:44.940]  and why he wouldn't answer his door.
[22:44.940 --> 22:46.380]  And I was like, he ain't home, bro.
[22:46.380 --> 22:47.380]  And they're like, what do you mean?
[22:47.380 --> 22:49.100]  And I was like, there's six cars in the driveway,
[22:49.100 --> 22:51.540]  but the one he drives every day ain't there.
[22:51.540 --> 22:53.140]  Like have a nice day.
[22:53.140 --> 22:55.060]  And they kept talking to me and they're like,
[22:55.060 --> 22:56.740]  yeah, we know he's growing a whole bunch of weed
[22:56.740 --> 22:58.700]  because, and get this folks,
[22:58.700 --> 23:02.160]  they accused him of screwing up people's cable connections
[23:02.160 --> 23:06.100]  and their radio frequencies in the area
[23:06.100 --> 23:08.500]  with his little tiny home grow.
[23:08.500 --> 23:09.820]  With the right amount of ballasts,
[23:09.820 --> 23:10.900]  that's actually possible.
[23:10.900 --> 23:13.700]  With the right equipment and the right number of pieces,
[23:13.700 --> 23:16.520]  you can fuck with radio frequencies a little bit,
[23:16.520 --> 23:18.620]  but you can't fuck with no people's cable.
[23:18.620 --> 23:20.900]  Right, they're just trying to fake probable cause.
[23:20.900 --> 23:21.740]  It's just nonsense.
[23:22.300 --> 23:26.060]  The other person that was staying with me at the time
[23:26.060 --> 23:27.740]  mentioned something about our cable
[23:27.740 --> 23:29.660]  while the cop happened to be standing in earshot.
[23:29.660 --> 23:32.060]  And so he tried to like use it as a,
[23:32.060 --> 23:33.660]  in with me like, bro, dude,
[23:33.660 --> 23:35.300]  the jerk next door that's growing weed
[23:35.300 --> 23:37.340]  is fucking up your TV.
[23:37.340 --> 23:38.460]  It's just nonsense.
[23:38.460 --> 23:40.160]  Trying to find a way to be your friend.
[23:40.160 --> 23:42.900]  I know for a fact the dude next door is 100% legal
[23:42.900 --> 23:45.360]  because he showed off his grow to me one night,
[23:45.360 --> 23:47.220]  like super proud of having finished building it.
[23:47.220 --> 23:48.620]  And like I high fived him
[23:48.620 --> 23:51.340]  and like made sure to wash my clothes right after
[23:51.980 --> 23:53.100]  because it wasn't pro status,
[23:53.100 --> 23:57.700]  but it was small and couldn't possibly fit
[23:57.700 --> 24:01.000]  more than six plants, let alone exceed any sort of limit.
[24:03.020 --> 24:05.940]  But even in our little place, they're worried about it.
[24:05.940 --> 24:07.940]  And if it's not the cops that notice
[24:07.940 --> 24:09.740]  that you're growing weed and are interested in it,
[24:09.740 --> 24:11.140]  it's the neighborhood teenagers
[24:11.140 --> 24:14.580]  or the creepy biker dude up the street.
[24:14.580 --> 24:17.340]  Like just, you're gonna wanna think about all that stuff
[24:17.340 --> 24:19.000]  before you go down this road,
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.680]  because if you don't,
[24:20.680 --> 24:23.840]  that's where the really nasty problems
[24:23.840 --> 24:26.800]  and headaches and black eyes for the community come in.
[24:26.800 --> 24:29.040]  The dude who throws 30 plants in his backyard
[24:29.040 --> 24:30.040]  sneaks out the neighborhood
[24:30.040 --> 24:31.840]  and ends up shooting one of the local teenagers
[24:31.840 --> 24:32.680]  during harvest.
[24:32.680 --> 24:33.520]  Right, right.
[24:33.520 --> 24:35.000]  But this guy's doing an indoor grow.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.400]  You know who this guy is.
[24:36.400 --> 24:37.680]  Just look up the local laws
[24:37.680 --> 24:40.680]  that you know how to best protect yourself
[24:40.680 --> 24:43.880]  and what parameters you wanna operate under.
[24:43.880 --> 24:44.720]  Yeah.
[24:44.720 --> 24:46.600]  It's just a good another point to look up as well.
[24:46.600 --> 24:47.840]  That's something that goes right along
[24:47.840 --> 24:49.640]  with the type of nutrients you're gonna buy.
[24:49.640 --> 24:51.320]  I think the type of that shows, you know,
[24:51.320 --> 24:52.640]  those the kind of person you are,
[24:52.640 --> 24:54.200]  the type of nutrients you buy,
[24:54.200 --> 24:56.680]  the amount of attention you pay to the law,
[24:56.680 --> 24:58.320]  that's all gonna reflect in your garden
[24:58.320 --> 25:00.120]  and the type of person that you are.
[25:00.120 --> 25:02.640]  But all right, let's focus back down on here a little bit.
[25:02.640 --> 25:03.580]  Mike wants you to buy books
[25:03.580 --> 25:06.120]  and follow the rules a lot, you guys.
[25:06.120 --> 25:08.760]  I wanna give a lot of credit to what I'm talking about
[25:08.760 --> 25:10.320]  to a guy known as Soma.
[25:10.320 --> 25:12.360]  Soma is a cannabis breeder.
[25:12.360 --> 25:13.200]  He's an old hippie.
[25:13.200 --> 25:14.120]  He's got some dreadlocks.
[25:14.120 --> 25:15.160]  He wears a bunch of crystals.
[25:15.160 --> 25:16.840]  He's kind of a weird dude.
[25:16.840 --> 25:18.800]  I kind of used to look up to him quite a bit.
[25:18.800 --> 25:21.480]  He teaches us about a thing called memetics.
[25:21.480 --> 25:24.140]  He says that there are 64 squares on the chess board
[25:24.140 --> 25:26.040]  and every one of them is an opportunity
[25:26.040 --> 25:28.000]  to improve or fuck up your garden.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.760]  So think about where you're putting your kings and queens
[25:29.760 --> 25:32.560]  on the chess board and play chess the best that you can.
[25:32.560 --> 25:34.640]  Memetics, that's all of the things in your environment.
[25:34.640 --> 25:35.680]  I did not Google this word.
[25:35.680 --> 25:38.040]  This is just from my memory from what Soma told me.
[25:38.040 --> 25:40.640]  Memetics is all the things in your environment combined.
[25:40.640 --> 25:43.120]  Every little detail that you can see and cannot see,
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.440]  can control and cannot control, those are memetics.
[25:45.440 --> 25:47.320]  The way that Mike is looking off into the distance
[25:47.320 --> 25:48.720]  right now like he's confused,
[25:48.720 --> 25:50.600]  that is part of the memetics of my environment.
[25:50.600 --> 25:53.400]  Even though it doesn't affect me, it is still part of,
[25:53.400 --> 25:55.440]  it's somehow, it's the memetics of this room.
[25:55.440 --> 25:57.240]  The airflow coming out of that duct,
[25:57.240 --> 25:58.760]  that's one of the things on my chess board.
[25:58.760 --> 25:59.760]  That light coming from above,
[25:59.760 --> 26:01.520]  that's one of the things on my chess board.
[26:01.520 --> 26:03.480]  The window open over there,
[26:03.480 --> 26:04.800]  that's one of the parts of my chess board.
[26:04.800 --> 26:06.480]  Those are all affecting my environment
[26:06.480 --> 26:08.120]  and my performance right now.
[26:08.120 --> 26:10.720]  And every one of those things has a very small impact.
[26:10.720 --> 26:13.160]  The Dr. Pepper, the water, the dab rig,
[26:13.160 --> 26:14.560]  all of those things have,
[26:14.560 --> 26:15.840]  this phone right here is distracting,
[26:15.840 --> 26:18.400]  so all those things have a few pieces of memetics
[26:18.400 --> 26:19.240]  on my chess board.
[26:19.240 --> 26:21.160]  And your plants have the same option in the grow.
[26:21.160 --> 26:23.200]  So every piece of dust in there
[26:23.200 --> 26:24.560]  is part of that grow environment
[26:24.560 --> 26:26.840]  that's affecting that plant in some weird way.
[26:26.840 --> 26:29.480]  So shout out to Soma for putting the memetics idea
[26:29.480 --> 26:31.560]  into my head that kind of put a lot of,
[26:31.560 --> 26:34.240]  it opened up a lot of stuff in my brain.
[26:34.240 --> 26:35.440]  It's super important.
[26:35.440 --> 26:38.120]  I mean, you're really creating an artificial environment
[26:38.120 --> 26:39.920]  for a life.
[26:39.920 --> 26:43.120]  And the amount of little pieces that can impact that
[26:43.120 --> 26:46.460]  in the environment you create is just limitless.
[26:48.140 --> 26:51.640]  How many times have we stood in the same grow room
[26:51.640 --> 26:55.120]  looking for new issues, issues we haven't seen before,
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.560]  issues that have come up since the last cleaning,
[26:59.240 --> 27:00.880]  and just knowing what to look out for?
[27:00.880 --> 27:04.760]  It takes a long time to be able to look into a space
[27:04.760 --> 27:08.240]  and think, okay, if I'm gonna do a small grow here,
[27:08.240 --> 27:11.160]  these are the things that are gonna be major issues here.
[27:11.160 --> 27:12.980]  These are the things I'm gonna need to upgrade
[27:13.840 --> 27:15.580]  or purchase, or this is the kind of size
[27:15.580 --> 27:16.680]  I could get away with.
[27:18.100 --> 27:19.920]  Just taking the time to understand
[27:19.920 --> 27:22.460]  what your parameters are, it's gonna help you out a lot.
[27:22.460 --> 27:23.880]  Like it's hard to know where to put the pieces
[27:23.880 --> 27:25.940]  on a chessboard if you don't know how to play the game.
[27:25.940 --> 27:27.820]  Not sure that memetics is the word I'm looking for
[27:27.820 --> 27:29.420]  now that I'm kind of looking at it on Wikipedia,
[27:29.420 --> 27:31.060]  but shout out to Soma for teaching me a word
[27:31.060 --> 27:32.300]  I fucking forgot.
[27:32.300 --> 27:33.420]  It could be memetics.
[27:33.420 --> 27:35.660]  This is the Wikipedia for memetics
[27:35.660 --> 27:37.480]  is a really not what I wanted.
[27:38.300 --> 27:40.500]  One thing I wrote down is you can't put turbos
[27:40.700 --> 27:43.460]  on an 86 Ford Escort and expect to win a race.
[27:43.460 --> 27:44.660]  If you're gonna build a race car,
[27:44.660 --> 27:46.320]  you gotta get a racing transmission.
[27:46.320 --> 27:48.420]  You've got to get yourself a racing steering wheel.
[27:48.420 --> 27:49.700]  You need a racing harness.
[27:49.700 --> 27:51.860]  A lot of you motherfuckers need a helmet.
[27:51.860 --> 27:53.940]  If you're gonna race, you gotta get all the racing gear.
[27:53.940 --> 27:55.380]  You can't just throw up some big lights
[27:55.380 --> 27:57.660]  and think that, that was the main point of this question.
[27:57.660 --> 27:58.820]  You can't just buy one thing.
[27:58.820 --> 28:00.540]  You've gotta get it all correct.
[28:00.540 --> 28:03.220]  And if you've got a budget, I would say,
[28:03.220 --> 28:05.860]  start with the lights, then go nutrients,
[28:05.860 --> 28:09.160]  then work on the soil, and then spend your budget
[28:09.160 --> 28:10.340]  where you can otherwise.
[28:11.180 --> 28:13.380]  Don't just go best lights and then shitty soil
[28:13.380 --> 28:14.380]  and shitty nutrients.
[28:14.380 --> 28:17.700]  You gotta kind of figure out where to spread the spread.
[28:17.700 --> 28:19.380]  We used to joke all the time
[28:19.380 --> 28:22.700]  that there should be a cannabis protective services,
[28:22.700 --> 28:25.280]  people you could call to come and rescue plants
[28:25.280 --> 28:28.080]  that were essentially being tortured to death by morons.
[28:29.260 --> 28:32.740]  And universally, it was people who loved cannabis,
[28:32.740 --> 28:34.380]  wanted to produce their own cannabis,
[28:34.380 --> 28:36.040]  had a huge passion for growing,
[28:36.040 --> 28:38.780]  and not a single fucking clue about how to go about it.
[28:39.660 --> 28:42.580]  And did, they had a $600 budget
[28:42.580 --> 28:45.520]  and went to the growth store and bought a $580 light.
[28:46.380 --> 28:49.180]  And then a $2 watering can and a $3 pot
[28:49.180 --> 28:51.460]  and said, I got what I need.
[28:51.460 --> 28:53.940]  They went home, they dug up some soil out of the backyard,
[28:53.940 --> 28:56.700]  they threw it in the pot, they planted their little plant,
[28:56.700 --> 29:00.400]  they stuck it under their giant light in a 95 degree garage
[29:00.400 --> 29:02.680]  and shut the door and called it a grow room.
[29:04.220 --> 29:05.900]  And you see something like that
[29:05.900 --> 29:07.060]  and you feel bad for the person
[29:07.140 --> 29:09.420]  because you know they dropped their whole nut
[29:09.420 --> 29:12.420]  on one piece of gear that's not useful on its own.
[29:12.420 --> 29:14.860]  And now you're running that wipe, it's just gonna cost.
[29:14.860 --> 29:19.260]  And now they're out the cost of that light every month extra.
[29:19.260 --> 29:21.220]  That's money that they could be saving
[29:21.220 --> 29:23.580]  to buy the two pieces of gear
[29:23.580 --> 29:25.980]  to make that one piece of gear useful.
[29:25.980 --> 29:26.820]  A duct fan.
[29:26.820 --> 29:28.500]  Remember that time we went to the dude's house
[29:28.500 --> 29:31.860]  and he had the LED light like 13 feet off the ground
[29:31.860 --> 29:33.080]  in that fucking plant.
[29:33.080 --> 29:34.340]  He's like, look how much this plant
[29:34.340 --> 29:35.660]  has grown in the past couple of days.
[29:35.660 --> 29:37.980]  I was like, bro, there's like a foot and a half
[29:37.980 --> 29:38.940]  between node spacing.
[29:38.940 --> 29:41.340]  That thing is not growing, that's called stretching.
[29:41.340 --> 29:44.940]  And it was in a pot the size of like a one liter soda bottle.
[29:44.940 --> 29:46.800]  Yeah, yeah, it looked like he just cut the top off
[29:46.800 --> 29:47.640]  my Dr. Pepper bottle.
[29:47.640 --> 29:49.700]  It was like seven feet tall.
[29:49.700 --> 29:51.300]  I'm sorry, I don't mean to make fun of that poor guy,
[29:51.300 --> 29:53.460]  but if he would have just thought about it
[29:53.460 --> 29:55.140]  and put that, bought the right light
[29:55.140 --> 29:56.580]  or put that light closer to the plant,
[29:56.580 --> 29:58.180]  he would have had much more success.
[29:58.180 --> 29:59.260]  Yeah, I mean.
[30:00.100 --> 30:01.620]  It was just right where he was playing video games.
[30:01.620 --> 30:02.940]  Dude, he was at a weed plant next to him
[30:02.940 --> 30:03.980]  playing video games.
[30:03.980 --> 30:06.460]  I can't tell you how many people I've seen
[30:06.460 --> 30:08.780]  chain smoking cigarettes in their grow room
[30:08.780 --> 30:11.380]  because they heard somewhere that the plants
[30:11.380 --> 30:13.740]  like extra carbon dioxide and they heard somewhere
[30:13.740 --> 30:16.740]  that carbon dioxide is something that comes off cigarettes.
[30:16.740 --> 30:17.580]  Yummy.
[30:17.580 --> 30:22.440]  And they take two technically true pieces of information,
[30:22.440 --> 30:24.540]  slam them together in their head in a way
[30:24.540 --> 30:27.100]  that sort of makes sense on the surface.
[30:27.100 --> 30:28.100]  And then they can't figure out
[30:28.100 --> 30:29.460]  why their plants are super sick.
[30:29.460 --> 30:33.380]  It's like, because you're blowing that toxic smoke at them.
[30:33.940 --> 30:34.980]  It's not good for them.
[30:34.980 --> 30:36.660]  They don't like it.
[30:36.660 --> 30:38.960]  It's hurting them, it's giving them diseases.
[30:40.420 --> 30:42.500]  I know so many people who's,
[30:42.500 --> 30:44.460]  the big problem in their grow turned out to be
[30:44.460 --> 30:46.580]  their dog likes to piss on their plants.
[30:46.580 --> 30:47.420]  Oh, that's awesome.
[30:47.420 --> 30:48.460]  Yeah, I know who that was.
[30:48.460 --> 30:50.080]  I've seen it happen to three or four people.
[30:50.080 --> 30:51.360]  It happened to the one fucking dude
[30:51.360 --> 30:53.360]  you're thinking of like six times.
[30:53.360 --> 30:56.340]  But I mean, some people are slower learners than others.
[30:56.340 --> 30:57.580]  You guys keep your pets and your cigarettes
[30:57.580 --> 30:58.540]  out of your grow room.
[30:58.540 --> 31:00.580]  A lot of people like to take pictures of their dogs
[31:00.580 --> 31:01.640]  and their cats in their grow room,
[31:01.640 --> 31:04.640]  but I think your animal's got bugs, bro.
[31:04.640 --> 31:05.640]  No matter how clean he is,
[31:05.640 --> 31:07.320]  but he's covered in fur, that fucker's got bugs.
[31:07.320 --> 31:08.400]  He's just not shitting in the yard.
[31:08.400 --> 31:09.600]  He's got some bugs on him.
[31:09.600 --> 31:11.480]  Don't let him in the grow.
[31:11.480 --> 31:12.840]  I barely let Mike in the grow.
[31:12.840 --> 31:17.640]  If you're in a bookstore or at a computer,
[31:17.640 --> 31:20.240]  the first four grow books you see
[31:20.240 --> 31:23.120]  will cover every issue we've brought up so far.
[31:24.100 --> 31:27.300]  At least enough to keep you from screwing it up real bad.
[31:29.760 --> 31:30.600]  Fair?
[31:30.600 --> 31:31.440]  Yeah, yeah.
[31:32.200 --> 31:33.160]  I was just waiting for you to tie that around
[31:33.160 --> 31:34.320]  to the dog walking in.
[31:34.320 --> 31:36.840]  I was waiting for some sort of dog tie-in reference there.
[31:36.840 --> 31:39.600]  It's one of those things that every grow book's
[31:39.600 --> 31:42.360]  gonna mention, keep your fucking dog out of the grow room.
[31:42.360 --> 31:45.200]  Still, there's dogs in half the grow rooms in America.
[31:45.200 --> 31:47.040]  You see them in all the people that post pictures
[31:47.040 --> 31:49.280]  of their private grow on Instagram.
[31:49.280 --> 31:50.320]  Whatever my dog's name is,
[31:50.320 --> 31:52.320]  Bruno likes to hang out by the plants.
[31:52.320 --> 31:53.400]  I'm like, yeah, Bruno does.
[31:53.400 --> 31:55.640]  He's fucking putting bugs and all kinds of shit
[31:55.640 --> 31:56.480]  on your plants.
[31:56.480 --> 31:57.800]  I'm not being an animal hater, you guys.
[31:57.800 --> 32:00.360]  That's a garden, that's a medical product.
[32:01.240 --> 32:02.840]  Some of you fucking hippies would.
[32:02.840 --> 32:04.760]  You don't have your dog right by the food
[32:04.760 --> 32:07.920]  when you're cooking, but you do, so I'm just gonna stop.
[32:07.920 --> 32:08.760]  All right.
[32:08.760 --> 32:09.600]  Yeah.
[32:09.600 --> 32:12.120]  You guys, there's no one thing you can buy.
[32:12.120 --> 32:14.400]  You gotta do everything with love,
[32:14.400 --> 32:15.840]  everything with care, the best you can.
[32:15.840 --> 32:19.320]  These plants start off with potential to be 100%,
[32:19.320 --> 32:21.200]  and as you get in their way and you fuck them up,
[32:21.200 --> 32:22.360]  you bring them down.
[32:22.360 --> 32:24.440]  So if you give everything you can the best you can,
[32:24.440 --> 32:27.200]  they'll come out 100, and then you'll do it better next time.
[32:27.200 --> 32:28.140]  You gotta learn.
[32:28.140 --> 32:29.280]  One thing I can recommend,
[32:29.280 --> 32:31.400]  quit trying to grow 17 different fucking strains.
[32:31.400 --> 32:34.600]  Pick a strain and grow it, dial it in, lock it in, nail it.
[32:34.600 --> 32:36.560]  Get that one and get it going the right way
[32:36.560 --> 32:37.600]  instead of trying to mess.
[32:37.600 --> 32:38.760]  You can't have seven girlfriends.
[32:38.760 --> 32:39.680]  You'll never make them happy.
[32:39.680 --> 32:41.960]  You can make one girlfriend really, really happy.
[32:41.960 --> 32:43.400]  That's a great fucking analogy
[32:43.400 --> 32:45.800]  because each plant is almost,
[32:45.800 --> 32:48.680]  if not exactly as complicated as a girlfriend.
[32:49.640 --> 32:51.640]  It wants different things at different times
[32:51.640 --> 32:56.560]  for different reasons, and if you've got a first-time grow,
[32:56.560 --> 32:58.080]  you don't wanna be trying to mix
[32:58.080 --> 33:00.280]  seven different types of nutrients
[33:00.280 --> 33:04.120]  in liter cup sizes, you'll go insane.
[33:04.120 --> 33:06.600]  You wonder, why does this OG Kush plant look totally happy,
[33:06.600 --> 33:08.200]  but this Hayes plant looks like shit?
[33:08.200 --> 33:09.840]  It's because you got a CalMag deficiency
[33:09.840 --> 33:12.520]  because those plants want completely fucking different things.
[33:12.520 --> 33:14.320]  Now you gotta learn how to mix nutrients
[33:14.320 --> 33:15.520]  for two sides of the room,
[33:15.520 --> 33:16.360]  and you're gonna fuck yourself.
[33:16.360 --> 33:17.180]  It's gonna be hard.
[33:17.180 --> 33:19.200]  Or you got one plant that's trying to be seven feet tall
[33:19.200 --> 33:21.080]  and one plant that's trying to be three and a half feet tall.
[33:21.080 --> 33:23.160]  Yeah, or one plant that finishes in nine weeks
[33:23.160 --> 33:24.480]  and one that finishes in seven,
[33:24.480 --> 33:25.560]  and you gotta figure out how you're gonna,
[33:25.560 --> 33:26.840]  you just gotta start flushing over here
[33:26.840 --> 33:28.600]  and cut down half the room, and then,
[33:28.600 --> 33:30.000]  yeah, it should just suck.
[33:30.000 --> 33:31.600]  Pick one strain, run the shit out of it.
[33:31.600 --> 33:32.960]  That's my idea.
[33:32.960 --> 33:34.080]  If you're an experienced grower,
[33:34.080 --> 33:35.000]  do whatever the fuck you want.
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.040]  Grow 32 strains in one room, make some flavors,
[33:37.040 --> 33:39.080]  but if you're new and you're trying to get shit dialed in,
[33:39.080 --> 33:40.640]  one strain's so much easier.
[33:40.640 --> 33:41.480]  Yep.
[33:41.480 --> 33:43.440]  All right, I hope I made a lot of sense
[33:43.440 --> 33:45.500]  because we got real sidetracked.
[33:46.640 --> 33:50.080]  Yeah, you can't put turbos on an 86 Escort
[33:50.080 --> 33:52.400]  and expect to win races.
[33:52.400 --> 33:54.600]  That was my favorite part of that.
[33:54.600 --> 33:56.820]  All right, I've got a really cool email
[33:57.800 --> 33:59.900]  from a guy who calls himself Arachnid Death.
[33:59.900 --> 34:03.060]  Yeah, Spider Death.
[34:03.060 --> 34:05.380]  Does that mean that he is the spider that kills
[34:05.380 --> 34:08.180]  or that he is killed by spiders?
[34:08.180 --> 34:09.260]  Or the spider killer.
[34:09.260 --> 34:11.540]  He's a spider killer, maybe.
[34:11.540 --> 34:13.740]  Arachnid Death, I expect another email.
[34:13.740 --> 34:16.380]  I wanna know, are you the spider killer?
[34:16.380 --> 34:17.980]  Inquiring minds and shit, bro.
[34:17.980 --> 34:20.940]  Were you killed by a spider or are you like,
[34:20.940 --> 34:22.140]  maybe he's-
[34:22.140 --> 34:23.140]  Dude, if it's the second one,
[34:23.140 --> 34:24.660]  you're gonna wait for a while for that email.
[34:24.660 --> 34:26.220]  I think he's Dale Gribble.
[34:26.540 --> 34:27.540]  Dale Gribble.
[34:27.540 --> 34:29.340]  He's Dale Rusty Shackleford.
[34:29.340 --> 34:31.220]  I think that's what he wants to be called on the show.
[34:31.220 --> 34:32.340]  Are you an exterminator, bro?
[34:32.340 --> 34:33.180]  I wanna know.
[34:33.180 --> 34:35.180]  All right, let's get to the email.
[34:35.180 --> 34:36.220]  It says, first things first,
[34:36.220 --> 34:37.820]  thank you so much for what you do.
[34:37.820 --> 34:40.620]  I wanted to take a moment and share some stuff with you.
[34:40.620 --> 34:43.580]  I recently exited the military after eight years of service.
[34:43.580 --> 34:45.400]  I joined at 24 after being laid off
[34:45.400 --> 34:47.100]  from what I thought would be the start
[34:47.100 --> 34:48.420]  of my lifetime career.
[34:48.420 --> 34:49.580]  After a year of unemployment
[34:49.580 --> 34:51.980]  during the economic downturn of 2008,
[34:51.980 --> 34:54.660]  I decided to join the service to provide for my family.
[34:54.700 --> 34:57.340]  Before joining, I thoroughly enjoyed consuming cannabis
[34:57.340 --> 34:58.420]  on the reg.
[34:58.420 --> 34:59.860]  In the four months since my exit,
[34:59.860 --> 35:03.460]  I've more than enjoyed my reintroduction into cannabis.
[35:03.460 --> 35:05.740]  However, much has changed in eight years.
[35:05.740 --> 35:08.380]  Dabs weren't a thing that I'm aware of back then,
[35:08.380 --> 35:10.320]  at least not in Southern Ohio.
[35:11.860 --> 35:14.540]  Very, I'm gonna say that that was probably an uncommon thing.
[35:14.540 --> 35:16.060]  I'm kind of pumped that dabs are a thing
[35:16.060 --> 35:18.260]  in Southern Ohio now.
[35:18.260 --> 35:19.240]  Yeah, yeah.
[35:19.240 --> 35:20.260]  He keeps going on.
[35:20.260 --> 35:23.180]  He says, what advice would you give someone like me?
[35:23.180 --> 35:24.540]  I'm eager to try a dab
[35:24.540 --> 35:26.560]  and I have a friend willing to host me.
[35:26.560 --> 35:28.920]  I don't know what to expect for my first time
[35:28.920 --> 35:30.620]  and I know it's different for everyone,
[35:30.620 --> 35:33.460]  but I was hoping you could try and explain it to me.
[35:33.460 --> 35:35.300]  I don't know how significant it is,
[35:35.300 --> 35:37.520]  but my friend has a nectar collector set up.
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.700]  I'm currently only going through a quarter ounce
[35:39.700 --> 35:41.380]  of cannabis flower, I'm going to assume.
[35:41.380 --> 35:42.900]  He says, I'm only going through a quarter ounce
[35:42.900 --> 35:44.220]  every six weeks.
[35:44.220 --> 35:46.240]  I was going through a quarter ounce of flowers
[35:46.240 --> 35:47.120]  every six weeks.
[35:47.120 --> 35:51.340]  So this guy's smoking around a gram a week.
[35:51.340 --> 35:52.180]  Yeah.
[35:52.340 --> 35:53.500]  That's a puff or two a day.
[35:53.500 --> 35:56.740]  Basically a one hit and quit each time I smoke.
[35:56.740 --> 35:59.680]  Would you recommend that I attempt to up my tolerance?
[35:59.680 --> 36:00.900]  If so, how?
[36:00.900 --> 36:02.180]  I'm a stay at home dad now,
[36:02.180 --> 36:04.560]  so my smoking really only occurs in the evenings
[36:04.560 --> 36:07.780]  when I'm not the sole caregiver to a toddler.
[36:07.780 --> 36:08.940]  What are your thoughts, man?
[36:08.940 --> 36:11.580]  I've been listening for a while to your show.
[36:11.580 --> 36:13.620]  Oh, I was turned on to your show from the Dude Gross Show,
[36:13.620 --> 36:15.500]  but I haven't listened to them in months.
[36:15.500 --> 36:18.480]  I thought I'd share, oh, another paragraph, sorry.
[36:18.480 --> 36:19.860]  I've got this on multiple pages.
[36:19.860 --> 36:21.900]  I thought I'd share my, what I listen to
[36:21.900 --> 36:23.220]  when I smoke information with you,
[36:23.220 --> 36:24.980]  because if you guys remember on 420,
[36:24.980 --> 36:26.660]  I asked everybody to tell me what they listen to
[36:26.660 --> 36:27.500]  when they get stoned.
[36:27.500 --> 36:29.580]  So he's going to tell us about his music interests.
[36:29.580 --> 36:30.500]  It goes like this.
[36:30.500 --> 36:31.900]  I'm a huge fan of music.
[36:31.900 --> 36:34.260]  My tastes have grown to be more eclectic since high school.
[36:34.260 --> 36:36.260]  My friends and I used to cruise around in my car
[36:36.260 --> 36:38.460]  and smoke and listen to Slipknot and similar,
[36:38.460 --> 36:41.340]  occasionally pausing for an in-car mosh.
[36:41.340 --> 36:44.980]  You were the other car in my high school.
[36:44.980 --> 36:46.260]  I was in a different car than that.
[36:46.260 --> 36:48.860]  We were the deadheads in tie dye, fucking long hair.
[36:48.860 --> 36:50.020]  We did not do the moshing.
[36:50.020 --> 36:50.860]  I was kind of-
[36:50.860 --> 36:51.820]  Different sides of the park.
[36:51.820 --> 36:52.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[36:52.740 --> 36:55.140]  The stoners prefer, the lodies prefer the grassy knoll
[36:55.140 --> 36:56.980]  is what I think the line is from Clueless.
[36:56.980 --> 36:58.500]  I about spit that all over the wall.
[36:58.500 --> 37:00.940]  I saw your water try to come through your nose.
[37:00.940 --> 37:03.140]  But nowadays I enjoy some rap and reggae.
[37:03.140 --> 37:05.620]  I've been listening to the iRevive's playlist on Spotify
[37:05.620 --> 37:06.460]  and I dig it.
[37:06.460 --> 37:08.780]  I created my own playlist with my favorites from it.
[37:08.780 --> 37:10.580]  They include songs from Revolution,
[37:10.580 --> 37:13.100]  Stick Figure, Tribal Seeds, and Dirty Heads.
[37:13.100 --> 37:13.920]  I'm sorry if these aren't-
[37:13.920 --> 37:14.760]  I knew one of those.
[37:14.760 --> 37:16.380]  He said, I'm sorry if these aren't up to par.
[37:16.380 --> 37:18.300]  Bro, you're doing good so far, don't worry.
[37:18.420 --> 37:20.460]  He also says, I swear to keep meaning to listen,
[37:20.460 --> 37:23.940]  I swear I keep meaning to listen to Mystic Roots Band.
[37:23.940 --> 37:24.780]  What I've heard on your show
[37:24.780 --> 37:26.860]  makes me think I'd like them overall.
[37:26.860 --> 37:28.580]  So after my evening smoke sesh,
[37:28.580 --> 37:30.780]  I like to grab my sketchbook and my headphones
[37:30.780 --> 37:33.900]  and listen to my iRe beats while sketching in my book.
[37:33.900 --> 37:36.580]  I love being able to unwind with my pipe and art
[37:36.580 --> 37:38.840]  and letting the huge changes in my life
[37:38.840 --> 37:41.020]  melt into the background for a while.
[37:41.020 --> 37:41.940]  On a recent episode,
[37:41.940 --> 37:45.140]  you stated that recreational use is medical use.
[37:45.140 --> 37:48.260]  I was unsure of my opinion until you made that statement.
[37:49.260 --> 37:50.100]  You're totally right.
[37:50.100 --> 37:52.540]  Using this flower in any manner that lets you reduce stress
[37:52.540 --> 37:54.460]  or just generally enjoy your life more
[37:54.460 --> 37:56.460]  counts as medicinal use.
[37:56.460 --> 37:58.380]  It's well said.
[37:58.380 --> 38:00.380]  Thanks for listening to a rambling man.
[38:00.380 --> 38:01.660]  I know you enjoy that.
[38:01.660 --> 38:04.740]  Thanks for everything you do and stay iRe, arachnid death.
[38:04.740 --> 38:06.200]  And then he's got a PS.
[38:06.200 --> 38:07.580]  I wanted to take a special moment
[38:07.580 --> 38:10.540]  and thank you for sharing your experience with TBI.
[38:10.540 --> 38:13.060]  I could tell that sharing like that was difficult.
[38:13.060 --> 38:14.620]  I hope it helped.
[38:14.620 --> 38:15.980]  I hope it helped.
[38:15.980 --> 38:17.500]  I know it helped me realize
[38:17.540 --> 38:20.140]  how seriously it can affect somebody's psyche.
[38:20.140 --> 38:21.940]  And then he states that he's been in the military
[38:21.940 --> 38:25.100]  and he knows plenty of people with a TBI.
[38:25.100 --> 38:28.500]  Super common to people who serve in and around him,
[38:28.500 --> 38:29.340]  I'm sure.
[38:29.340 --> 38:30.300]  Yes, yes.
[38:30.300 --> 38:33.300]  Man, first off, we gotta say thanks for your service.
[38:33.300 --> 38:35.220]  Huge, thank you so much for your service.
[38:35.220 --> 38:36.940]  That was an awesome email too, by the way.
[38:36.940 --> 38:37.940]  Thank you so much for that.
[38:37.940 --> 38:38.860]  We're gonna go back through it
[38:38.860 --> 38:40.020]  and hit some talking points here.
[38:40.020 --> 38:42.540]  But I've said it before,
[38:42.540 --> 38:44.820]  I'm a dreadlocks fucking pot smoking hippie.
[38:44.820 --> 38:46.540]  I'm not into fucking war and shit,
[38:46.580 --> 38:49.700]  but I appreciate that there are guys that sign up
[38:49.700 --> 38:51.700]  and are willing to go to war
[38:51.700 --> 38:53.340]  so that you and I don't have to.
[38:53.340 --> 38:54.700]  Because if people didn't sign up,
[38:54.700 --> 38:56.140]  they would draft motherfuckers.
[38:56.140 --> 38:57.420]  And bro, you're six something.
[38:57.420 --> 38:58.260]  You're like six four, 200 pounds.
[38:58.260 --> 38:59.820]  I would not do well in the military.
[38:59.820 --> 39:01.420]  But your body type, you would do well in the military.
[39:01.420 --> 39:02.260]  That was like the nicest thing
[39:02.260 --> 39:03.420]  anyone has ever said about me.
[39:03.420 --> 39:04.260]  Yeah, I am.
[39:04.260 --> 39:06.140]  I'm like six four, 260.
[39:06.140 --> 39:09.100]  I guess, yeah, the radio takes away 60 pounds.
[39:09.100 --> 39:10.380]  Thanks, bro.
[39:10.380 --> 39:11.220]  Starting to be nice.
[39:11.220 --> 39:12.300]  But they'd fucking draft your ass
[39:12.300 --> 39:13.380]  and turn you into a soldier, bro.
[39:13.380 --> 39:14.220]  You would be a soldier.
[39:14.220 --> 39:15.060]  I would also.
[39:15.060 --> 39:16.780]  I'm fucking six five and 210 pounds.
[39:16.780 --> 39:19.220]  I'd be the first guy on Operation Hide Behind Him
[39:19.220 --> 39:20.460]  until he gets shot.
[39:20.460 --> 39:21.300]  Yeah.
[39:21.300 --> 39:22.140]  We'd be the first one.
[39:22.140 --> 39:22.980]  Not a good soldier.
[39:22.980 --> 39:24.660]  We'd be kicked out for fucking smoking weed.
[39:24.660 --> 39:25.500]  We'd be on purpose.
[39:25.500 --> 39:26.860]  Or beat to death by the drill sergeant
[39:26.860 --> 39:28.340]  on the second day of boot camp.
[39:28.340 --> 39:30.340]  Keep calling him brah.
[39:30.340 --> 39:31.820]  Brah, why are you yelling at me?
[39:31.820 --> 39:32.660]  Yes, sir, brah.
[39:32.660 --> 39:33.500]  Brah, why are you hitting me?
[39:33.500 --> 39:34.580]  Brah, I don't do push-ups.
[39:34.580 --> 39:35.420]  We're getting disrespectful.
[39:35.420 --> 39:36.260]  Let's not do that.
[39:36.260 --> 39:37.100]  Because this guy just got fucking.
[39:37.100 --> 39:38.460]  No, it's just I'm so not,
[39:38.460 --> 39:39.420]  that's just not me.
[39:39.420 --> 39:41.460]  And because it's not me
[39:41.460 --> 39:44.340]  and I know what that lifestyle would do to me
[39:44.340 --> 39:46.540]  and because I also know how vital it is
[39:46.540 --> 39:47.500]  for our way of life,
[39:47.500 --> 39:49.180]  like I just have a huge amount of respect
[39:49.180 --> 39:50.260]  for people who did serve.
[39:50.260 --> 39:51.100]  Absolutely.
[39:51.100 --> 39:53.100]  I'm not, I never support a war,
[39:53.100 --> 39:55.500]  but I always support our troops.
[39:55.500 --> 39:57.100]  It's the best way I think I can put that.
[39:57.100 --> 39:57.940]  All right.
[39:57.940 --> 39:59.140]  So first thing he says, thank you, bro.
[39:59.140 --> 39:59.980]  Fucking thank you.
[39:59.980 --> 40:00.980]  So thanks in return.
[40:00.980 --> 40:02.780]  I appreciate the thank you.
[40:02.780 --> 40:04.700]  Message received.
[40:04.700 --> 40:05.540]  Let's see.
[40:05.540 --> 40:06.780]  There's a lot to talk about here.
[40:07.780 --> 40:11.740]  Reintroduction to cannabis after fucking eight years.
[40:11.740 --> 40:13.300]  That's awesome.
[40:13.300 --> 40:15.260]  I can only imagine what an eight year cannabis break
[40:15.260 --> 40:16.100]  would be like.
[40:16.100 --> 40:17.780]  That's a hell of a tolerance break.
[40:17.780 --> 40:19.780]  He says, what advice would you give somebody like me
[40:19.780 --> 40:21.620]  because he's eager to try a dab.
[40:21.620 --> 40:23.020]  He's got a friend that'll help him
[40:23.020 --> 40:24.900]  and he doesn't know what to expect.
[40:26.020 --> 40:28.140]  Let's try to explain to him a little bit
[40:28.140 --> 40:30.460]  about what he's gonna get from his first dab.
[40:30.460 --> 40:31.660]  And then he also states
[40:31.660 --> 40:33.460]  that his buddy's got a nectar collector.
[40:33.460 --> 40:36.540]  I wanna know, is this nectar collector,
[40:37.300 --> 40:38.140]  does it have water?
[40:38.140 --> 40:41.100]  Some of the nectar collectors don't have water, some do.
[40:41.100 --> 40:41.940]  I will.
[40:41.940 --> 40:45.860]  The nectar collector period, water, no water.
[40:45.860 --> 40:48.940]  It's harder to size your hit that way if you're not careful.
[40:48.940 --> 40:49.780]  True.
[40:49.780 --> 40:52.220]  Only set aside a very small part on.
[40:52.220 --> 40:55.060]  So the nectar collector, you heat it up
[40:55.060 --> 40:56.940]  and it just looks like a giant straw.
[40:56.940 --> 41:00.220]  And it's got a, hopefully a crystal, a quartz crystal,
[41:00.220 --> 41:01.700]  a glass or a titanium tip.
[41:01.700 --> 41:03.660]  The three types of tips that I would hit off of.
[41:03.660 --> 41:05.100]  I wouldn't dab off of anything else.
[41:05.100 --> 41:07.540]  Glass, quartz crystal or titanium.
[41:07.540 --> 41:08.940]  There may be something else I'm not aware of,
[41:08.940 --> 41:10.460]  but I don't think I'd dab off anything else.
[41:10.460 --> 41:11.620]  Hopefully it's got that.
[41:11.620 --> 41:13.180]  Hopefully it's got water.
[41:13.180 --> 41:16.180]  I really hope your first dab comes through an apparatus
[41:16.180 --> 41:17.340]  that has got water.
[41:17.340 --> 41:21.020]  Without water, a dab is hot as fuck on your lungs.
[41:21.020 --> 41:24.260]  Part of the experience of a dab is the hit itself
[41:24.260 --> 41:25.700]  in your body, in your lungs,
[41:25.700 --> 41:28.580]  your physical reaction to that new smoke,
[41:28.580 --> 41:30.820]  that new, it's a different level of heat
[41:30.820 --> 41:32.340]  than what you're used to smoking.
[41:32.380 --> 41:35.300]  The vapor is very, very different than a smoke.
[41:35.300 --> 41:36.300]  Yes, yes.
[41:36.300 --> 41:37.780]  It feels heavy.
[41:37.780 --> 41:40.980]  It feels, sometimes it feels like some,
[41:40.980 --> 41:42.980]  like someone's just got their foot on your chest
[41:42.980 --> 41:45.340]  and you just, and you just can't breathe right.
[41:45.340 --> 41:47.700]  It only lasts for a couple of few seconds in my,
[41:47.700 --> 41:50.300]  Jenny Betts says I can't say couple few anymore.
[41:50.300 --> 41:51.380]  Couple could be like,
[41:51.380 --> 41:53.420]  couple few could be anywhere between three to eight.
[41:53.420 --> 41:54.260]  That's couple few.
[41:54.260 --> 41:55.340]  A couple few.
[41:55.340 --> 41:56.180]  That's my thing.
[41:56.180 --> 41:58.620]  But it only hurts for a couple of few seconds.
[41:58.620 --> 42:00.320]  Like three to eight seconds, we're gonna say.
[42:00.320 --> 42:01.960]  It just feels like you might die.
[42:02.580 --> 42:03.420]  But I find it pleasant.
[42:03.420 --> 42:05.280]  It's like a, but I like, I don't know.
[42:05.280 --> 42:07.000]  I kind of like that scary part of a dab.
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.600]  He's a weird guy that eats insanely hot jalapenos
[42:09.600 --> 42:10.640]  and shit for entertainment.
[42:10.640 --> 42:13.760]  I recommend you take a dab smaller than a piece of rice.
[42:13.760 --> 42:17.020]  You want a very, very small, it's sort of like,
[42:18.200 --> 42:19.240]  I like to think of it this way.
[42:19.240 --> 42:20.740]  You're a beer drinker.
[42:20.740 --> 42:22.520]  You've worked yourself up to going out
[42:22.520 --> 42:25.440]  and having a 40 ounce beer after work,
[42:25.440 --> 42:26.960]  chilling at the bar for an hour,
[42:26.960 --> 42:29.200]  going home not intoxicated.
[42:29.200 --> 42:30.840]  If you switch to hard liquor,
[42:30.840 --> 42:33.000]  you don't start with the 40 ounce mug.
[42:34.800 --> 42:37.040]  And that's what a lot of people kind of try to do
[42:37.040 --> 42:40.440]  with their first dab is they end up taking something
[42:40.440 --> 42:43.820]  that's like you fill the pint glass with vodka.
[42:43.820 --> 42:44.880]  That was a bad idea.
[42:44.880 --> 42:46.040]  Yeah.
[42:46.040 --> 42:47.200]  And their friends let them do it
[42:47.200 --> 42:48.280]  because they think it's funny.
[42:48.280 --> 42:50.440]  And it's, that makes people so not want to dab.
[42:50.440 --> 42:52.920]  You want a grain of rice or half a grain of rice.
[42:52.920 --> 42:54.840]  I was gonna say half a grain of rice
[42:54.840 --> 42:57.400]  is probably a big enough dab for your first try.
[42:57.400 --> 42:58.640]  So you've got your nectar collector.
[42:58.640 --> 43:00.480]  Hopefully it's got water.
[43:01.120 --> 43:02.880]  And don't suck so hard you get the water in your mouth.
[43:02.880 --> 43:05.360]  Give it a test before you even heat it
[43:05.360 --> 43:06.320]  and start smoking through it.
[43:06.320 --> 43:07.760]  Put that nectar collector up to your mouth
[43:07.760 --> 43:10.240]  and pull through it and see what that experience is like.
[43:10.240 --> 43:11.080]  Feel that.
[43:11.080 --> 43:14.760]  Then have put the little half grain of rice dab
[43:14.760 --> 43:16.260]  on whatever you're smoking off of.
[43:16.260 --> 43:18.640]  I do not like smoking off of oil slick pads.
[43:18.640 --> 43:21.440]  I do not like smoking out of silicone containers.
[43:21.440 --> 43:22.940]  I like to put it on glass.
[43:22.940 --> 43:24.240]  I put my dab on glass.
[43:24.240 --> 43:26.320]  It's the only thing I fucking trust for this.
[43:26.320 --> 43:28.080]  I don't like the other shit.
[43:28.080 --> 43:28.920]  I'm sorry.
[43:28.920 --> 43:29.740]  I'm picky.
[43:30.040 --> 43:31.020]  I don't wanna smoke your silicone.
[43:31.020 --> 43:33.260]  I don't wanna burn shit with my fucking nectar collector.
[43:33.260 --> 43:34.080]  I don't like that.
[43:34.080 --> 43:36.420]  So I highly recommend you put it on glass.
[43:37.380 --> 43:38.820]  Set your little dab on a piece of glass.
[43:38.820 --> 43:40.480]  Heat up your nectar collector.
[43:40.480 --> 43:42.660]  Touch the nectar collector to the dab and inhale.
[43:42.660 --> 43:44.100]  Kinda inhale right before you touch it
[43:44.100 --> 43:46.740]  because as soon as it touches, it's gonna vaporize.
[43:46.740 --> 43:47.700]  Take your little dab.
[43:47.700 --> 43:50.000]  You only want that much smoke.
[43:50.000 --> 43:51.220]  Like it should sound like this.
[43:51.220 --> 43:52.100]  Like seriously.
[43:54.020 --> 43:56.740]  That's probably enough smoke for your first dab.
[43:56.740 --> 43:57.660]  Yeah, just a little.
[43:57.660 --> 44:00.140]  You can always smoke more,
[44:00.140 --> 44:02.620]  but Ron White told Joe Rogan on a podcast one time,
[44:02.620 --> 44:05.500]  he goes, boy, you can't unsmoke that joint now, can ya?
[44:05.500 --> 44:07.860]  Because Rogan was talking some fucking nonsense
[44:07.860 --> 44:09.180]  and Ron White just looked at him like,
[44:09.180 --> 44:10.700]  motherfucker, where are you?
[44:10.700 --> 44:13.860]  So you can't unsmoke a dab, but you can take another one
[44:13.860 --> 44:14.900]  and you're gonna want to.
[44:14.900 --> 44:15.860]  So fucking take a small one.
[44:15.860 --> 44:16.700]  So you can take another one
[44:16.700 --> 44:19.660]  instead of just coughing for 30 minutes, but I'm off track.
[44:19.660 --> 44:21.220]  Get a little half grain piece of rice.
[44:21.220 --> 44:22.260]  Heat that motherfucker up.
[44:22.260 --> 44:23.500]  Take a little dab.
[44:23.500 --> 44:25.660]  Don't hold it in like you do when you smoke flowers.
[44:25.660 --> 44:26.500]  It's just in and out.
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.340]  In and out.
[44:28.340 --> 44:29.620]  You just want to breathe it in, breathe it out.
[44:29.620 --> 44:33.140]  Now, I don't know what to expect for my first time
[44:33.140 --> 44:34.300]  and I know it's different for everyone,
[44:34.300 --> 44:36.020]  but I was hoping you could try and explain it to me.
[44:36.020 --> 44:37.100]  The smoke's gonna go in.
[44:37.100 --> 44:39.780]  You're gonna go, holy shit, as soon as it hits your lungs,
[44:39.780 --> 44:41.460]  your lungs go, get out, get out, get out.
[44:41.460 --> 44:42.600]  Let it out.
[44:42.600 --> 44:44.460]  Your eyes are gonna start to water.
[44:44.460 --> 44:45.940]  Your face is gonna turn red.
[44:45.940 --> 44:47.140]  You're going to sweat a little.
[44:47.140 --> 44:48.100]  You're gonna sweat.
[44:48.100 --> 44:49.580]  You're gonna, I hope you sweat.
[44:49.580 --> 44:51.020]  That's part of, dabs are part of the fun.
[44:51.020 --> 44:53.140]  A good dab is like every sweat gland
[44:53.140 --> 44:54.860]  on your body just threw up.
[44:54.860 --> 44:56.220]  It's, oh, I love it.
[44:56.220 --> 44:58.340]  It's kind of a good cleansing feeling.
[44:58.340 --> 45:00.460]  You sweat like a son of a bitch.
[45:00.460 --> 45:01.980]  I'm reaching for my shatter while I do this.
[45:01.980 --> 45:03.140]  And I'm reaching for water
[45:03.140 --> 45:04.860]  because just talking about it's making me thirsty.
[45:04.860 --> 45:05.700]  It's making me want to dab, that's so great.
[45:05.700 --> 45:07.180]  It's making me want to dab too.
[45:07.180 --> 45:09.680]  And you're gonna get this head rush feeling.
[45:09.680 --> 45:13.700]  You're gonna get really super high, really super fast.
[45:13.700 --> 45:15.600]  A lot of people kind of panic from that.
[45:15.600 --> 45:16.980]  Just chill out, you're okay.
[45:16.980 --> 45:19.700]  You, sounds like you're a veteran, you're a soldier.
[45:19.700 --> 45:21.780]  Soldier through it, you'll be fucking just fine.
[45:23.020 --> 45:25.500]  You said you've got a buddy who's down
[45:25.740 --> 45:27.540]  to roll with you through this.
[45:27.540 --> 45:30.460]  And it's just as long as you guys are cool with each other,
[45:30.460 --> 45:31.700]  get along reasonably well.
[45:31.700 --> 45:34.020]  And he's cool if you sleep on his couch for six hours,
[45:34.020 --> 45:35.180]  you're not gonna have any problems.
[45:35.180 --> 45:37.340]  Yeah, you may need a little nap at the end of all this.
[45:37.340 --> 45:38.500]  Just a little rest or just chill.
[45:38.500 --> 45:40.140]  Even us pros, every now and again,
[45:40.140 --> 45:41.500]  we have to hit pause on the show
[45:41.500 --> 45:42.820]  and just chill for 40 minutes.
[45:42.820 --> 45:45.220]  Jesse's been here and halfway into the show,
[45:45.220 --> 45:47.660]  he gave me the no and went and napped on the couch.
[45:47.660 --> 45:48.580]  So it happens.
[45:48.580 --> 45:50.460]  So take a little half a dab.
[45:50.460 --> 45:51.900]  You're gonna get sweaty.
[45:51.900 --> 45:52.780]  You're gonna get hot.
[45:52.780 --> 45:54.660]  You're gonna get, your throat may burn from it.
[45:54.660 --> 45:55.580]  You may cough.
[45:55.580 --> 45:57.780]  You may shoot a booger out of your nose.
[45:57.780 --> 45:59.820]  All of that shit is part of your first dab.
[45:59.820 --> 46:01.060]  That's part of the club.
[46:01.060 --> 46:02.620]  That's welcome to the dab club.
[46:02.620 --> 46:04.340]  Michael fucking cough for 20 minutes
[46:04.340 --> 46:05.860]  and shoot a booger out of his nose still.
[46:05.860 --> 46:09.260]  I've been dabbing for years and I still cough for a while.
[46:10.420 --> 46:12.060]  I gave James a dab the other day.
[46:12.060 --> 46:13.780]  My buddy James has got a shaved head.
[46:13.780 --> 46:14.900]  He just shaved his head real close.
[46:14.900 --> 46:16.420]  He gives himself a little buzz cut
[46:16.420 --> 46:17.700]  and he's got a little beard.
[46:17.700 --> 46:19.380]  And he took a dab the other day that I can,
[46:19.380 --> 46:20.660]  it looked like you were just,
[46:20.660 --> 46:22.500]  like his head became a fucking sprinkler.
[46:22.500 --> 46:23.340]  Literally just got hit with a bucket of water.
[46:23.340 --> 46:24.260]  And it just kept dripping.
[46:24.820 --> 46:25.660]  And I was like, where's it all coming from?
[46:25.660 --> 46:26.660]  He's like, boss man, I'm sweating
[46:26.660 --> 46:27.940]  like a motherfucker back here.
[46:27.940 --> 46:29.580]  It was so funny watching James sweat.
[46:29.580 --> 46:31.100]  He dabs every day with me.
[46:31.100 --> 46:32.180]  That dab got him.
[46:32.180 --> 46:34.140]  I just moved from one spot to another.
[46:34.140 --> 46:36.500]  And in the middle of the move, I stopped and took a dab.
[46:36.500 --> 46:39.100]  And it was a little big and it was a little hot.
[46:40.020 --> 46:41.100]  I had to change shirts after.
[46:41.100 --> 46:42.540]  Let's talk about temperature.
[46:43.620 --> 46:45.460]  You don't want a really hot dab.
[46:45.460 --> 46:46.660]  Hot dabs burn your lungs.
[46:46.660 --> 46:47.780]  Hot dabs burn turps.
[46:47.780 --> 46:49.940]  Hot dabs, I do hot dabs.
[46:49.940 --> 46:52.220]  You feel a hot dab in your lungs a lot.
[46:52.220 --> 46:54.860]  Jeff does a hot dab for a specific reason.
[46:54.860 --> 46:58.260]  He takes a hot dab because he takes a huge dab.
[46:58.260 --> 47:01.260]  And if the dab isn't hot enough at the beginning,
[47:01.260 --> 47:03.060]  there's not enough heat there in the middle
[47:03.060 --> 47:05.540]  and to properly give him the hit he's trying to take.
[47:05.540 --> 47:07.660]  And I waste three quarters of what I just threw in the nail.
[47:07.660 --> 47:09.980]  And then you end up Q-tipping it out like a moron.
[47:09.980 --> 47:12.180]  I'm gonna, a humble brag is what I think
[47:12.180 --> 47:14.100]  this might've been called back in the day.
[47:14.100 --> 47:15.980]  What we just told this listener to smoke
[47:15.980 --> 47:18.500]  is half of a grain of rice for his first dab.
[47:18.500 --> 47:19.620]  And it's going to be effective.
[47:19.620 --> 47:21.300]  It's not gonna leave him short of anything.
[47:21.300 --> 47:22.620]  You'll be high from this.
[47:22.620 --> 47:25.060]  Arachnid death, you'll get high from this.
[47:25.060 --> 47:26.220]  And if you don't smoke another one,
[47:26.220 --> 47:27.380]  if you don't smoke another one,
[47:27.380 --> 47:29.380]  and then start playing games with yourself.
[47:29.380 --> 47:31.180]  You'll be like, well, a dab hits you immediately.
[47:31.180 --> 47:32.020]  So you'll know.
[47:32.020 --> 47:33.300]  You'll be like, do I want another one or not?
[47:33.300 --> 47:35.380]  And you'll know, yes or no.
[47:35.380 --> 47:36.720]  And then start playing games with yourself.
[47:36.720 --> 47:38.040]  See how much of a dab you can take.
[47:38.040 --> 47:39.740]  What I like to do with the Nectar Collector,
[47:39.740 --> 47:40.980]  I will make a worm.
[47:40.980 --> 47:44.900]  I'll take a long ass, like a fucking three or four inch worm
[47:44.900 --> 47:48.420]  of hash and lay it on whatever piece of glass I'm using.
[47:48.420 --> 47:49.840]  And I will smoke the whole fucking thing
[47:49.840 --> 47:50.940]  with the Nectar Collector.
[47:51.780 --> 47:54.380]  Like a goddamn ant eater sucking up a line of ants.
[47:54.380 --> 47:55.540]  But what I was getting at is,
[47:55.540 --> 47:58.220]  we just told this guy to smoke a piece of rice.
[47:58.220 --> 48:00.500]  The dab I just put on this dabber,
[48:00.500 --> 48:03.420]  that's probably 0.3 of a gram.
[48:03.420 --> 48:06.660]  That's probably, would you say pinky nail?
[48:06.660 --> 48:08.220]  It's an adult male's thumbnail.
[48:08.220 --> 48:09.180]  I wouldn't say thumbnail,
[48:09.180 --> 48:10.820]  I'd say that's like a pointer fingernail.
[48:10.820 --> 48:11.900]  Tip it towards me.
[48:13.180 --> 48:14.580]  You got big man hands though, bro.
[48:14.580 --> 48:15.700]  You're six foot something.
[48:15.700 --> 48:18.100]  It's a decent guy's ring finger nail.
[48:18.100 --> 48:18.940]  I'll give it a ring finger nail.
[48:19.500 --> 48:22.540]  Three or four times thicker than anything I've ever seen.
[48:22.540 --> 48:24.260]  And I'm gonna take this dab here in just a second
[48:24.260 --> 48:26.740]  when Mike's talking and it's not gonna ruin me.
[48:26.740 --> 48:28.180]  I'm hopefully not gonna cough.
[48:28.180 --> 48:30.500]  It'll make my eyes a touch red for a few minutes.
[48:30.500 --> 48:32.880]  This kind of ties into another piece.
[48:32.880 --> 48:37.180]  He mentions what he's listening to when he smokes
[48:37.180 --> 48:39.660]  and then says he hopes that's up to snuff.
[48:39.660 --> 48:43.300]  And when you read that, the first thing that hit me was,
[48:43.300 --> 48:45.580]  bro, it's music that you like.
[48:45.580 --> 48:46.420]  Oh, love it whatever you want.
[48:46.740 --> 48:48.700]  The only person who gets to decide
[48:48.700 --> 48:50.260]  if it's up to snuff is you.
[48:50.260 --> 48:51.100]  Yes.
[48:51.100 --> 48:53.160]  And with the dab size,
[48:54.940 --> 48:56.980]  people have this weird competition thing
[48:56.980 --> 48:58.140]  that they do with everything.
[48:58.140 --> 49:00.420]  You're gonna eat one donut, I'm gonna eat two.
[49:00.420 --> 49:02.720]  You're gonna hit on one chick, I'm gonna hit on two.
[49:02.720 --> 49:05.420]  You're gonna take one dab, I'm gonna take two.
[49:05.420 --> 49:07.360]  Please don't do that with Hash.
[49:09.340 --> 49:13.400]  Marijuana is totally fun until you way overdo it.
[49:13.400 --> 49:16.300]  And if you just kind of go easy
[49:16.300 --> 49:18.200]  and figure out where your limits are a little bit,
[49:18.200 --> 49:20.760]  you're gonna have such a better time.
[49:20.760 --> 49:22.120]  Remember the dude having to call his wife
[49:22.120 --> 49:23.320]  to come pick his ass up?
[49:24.720 --> 49:26.320]  Remember the cop that had to call 911
[49:26.320 --> 49:27.840]  because he was too high and thought he was dying?
[49:27.840 --> 49:29.480]  Thought he was dying.
[49:29.480 --> 49:31.080]  It happens, people end up.
[49:31.080 --> 49:33.720]  No, put a space between those sentences
[49:33.720 --> 49:35.400]  because we just said the guy that called 911
[49:35.400 --> 49:36.240]  because he thought he was dying
[49:36.240 --> 49:37.160]  and then you said it happens.
[49:37.160 --> 49:39.160]  People do not die from cannabis, that's impossible.
[49:39.160 --> 49:41.320]  You can't die from consuming too much weed,
[49:41.320 --> 49:43.400]  but you can make yourself miserable
[49:43.400 --> 49:45.360]  by consuming too much weed.
[49:45.360 --> 49:48.080]  And in the legalization stage,
[49:48.080 --> 49:51.280]  there was a big bump in people calling poison control
[49:51.280 --> 49:52.840]  and then showing up at the ERs
[49:52.840 --> 49:56.360]  for just having way over consumed, not paying attention.
[49:56.360 --> 49:58.680]  Typically with edibles, people fucking hate,
[49:58.680 --> 49:59.920]  adults hate reading labels.
[49:59.920 --> 50:01.440]  We don't read labels for shit.
[50:02.680 --> 50:05.320]  And so a lot of people way over consumed edibles
[50:05.320 --> 50:07.060]  and ended up in the hospital the first time
[50:07.060 --> 50:09.400]  they ate edibles in Colorado or Washington
[50:09.400 --> 50:11.080]  just because they never read the label.
[50:11.080 --> 50:13.440]  And if you just take a little dab and see where you're at,
[50:13.440 --> 50:15.000]  you're gonna have a great time.
[50:16.200 --> 50:18.960]  If you look at your friend that's a regular dabber
[50:18.960 --> 50:21.440]  and try to mimic their consumption level,
[50:21.440 --> 50:23.520]  you're gonna have a miserable fucking time.
[50:23.520 --> 50:25.400]  Maybe, maybe he's gonna fucking love it.
[50:25.400 --> 50:26.960]  He could be like me, I'm a savage
[50:26.960 --> 50:28.600]  and I love just crossing that threshold.
[50:28.600 --> 50:33.600]  Pretty much everyone I know has a type of alcoholic beverage
[50:33.760 --> 50:36.160]  that they can't even think about.
[50:36.440 --> 50:39.920]  They start to say whiskey sour or whatever it is for them.
[50:39.920 --> 50:41.360]  That's Jose Cuervo.
[50:41.360 --> 50:43.880]  Their nose starts running a little into their throat
[50:43.880 --> 50:47.760]  and their tongue starts getting real thick and dry.
[50:47.760 --> 50:50.840]  And everyone has that because when you were first learning
[50:50.840 --> 50:52.980]  to consume alcohol, you way over did it
[50:52.980 --> 50:54.200]  with whatever product.
[50:55.200 --> 50:59.660]  And if you can just avoid doing that to yourself with hash,
[50:59.660 --> 51:01.800]  you don't ever have to be the guy that has to,
[51:01.800 --> 51:04.080]  yeah, the first time I took a dab, I pooped myself
[51:04.080 --> 51:05.560]  and fell asleep on Jerry's couch.
[51:05.920 --> 51:07.920]  I just put too much of a dab in the rig for myself.
[51:07.920 --> 51:10.840]  So I just tag team buddy past the leftover dab to Mike.
[51:10.840 --> 51:12.760]  That's why he cut out.
[51:12.760 --> 51:13.600]  Teamwork.
[51:15.000 --> 51:15.840]  All right.
[51:15.840 --> 51:17.440]  Oh, I got a hell of a head.
[51:17.440 --> 51:18.920]  Yeah, that was a pretty big dab.
[51:18.920 --> 51:21.280]  Made sure to save you a little extra.
[51:21.280 --> 51:22.680]  I didn't wanna do what you're doing.
[51:22.680 --> 51:24.600]  I'm gonna turn Mike's mic down for just a minute, bro.
[51:24.600 --> 51:26.400]  When you're ready, give me a thumbs up.
[51:27.320 --> 51:28.840]  I wasn't trying to be rude and kill him, you guys.
[51:28.840 --> 51:30.440]  That was kind of a bigger dab than Mike needed.
[51:30.440 --> 51:31.480]  He's got his thumbs down.
[51:31.480 --> 51:32.840]  He just, there's two thumbs down.
[51:32.840 --> 51:35.200]  Like do not fuck with my microphone.
[51:35.840 --> 51:36.680]  I wanna ask Mike a question.
[51:36.680 --> 51:39.680]  He can listen, but it's gonna be a minute before he replies.
[51:39.680 --> 51:44.680]  Our listener says, I smoke one hit each time
[51:44.680 --> 51:49.000]  and I quit because I'm pretty sure he's plenty high.
[51:49.000 --> 51:54.000]  Can we quantify what a dab is going to do to him?
[51:54.000 --> 51:56.320]  Like how many hits do you think a dab equals?
[51:56.320 --> 51:58.560]  If he takes one hit at a time,
[51:58.560 --> 52:00.320]  how many hits do you think it would take
[52:00.320 --> 52:01.880]  to get to a small dab?
[52:01.880 --> 52:03.840]  Would you say three?
[52:03.840 --> 52:05.880]  You just showed me six.
[52:05.880 --> 52:07.520]  So six hits off of your pipe.
[52:07.520 --> 52:09.080]  You're gonna have to work your way up to six hits
[52:09.080 --> 52:12.440]  off your pipe to achieve what you get with one dab.
[52:12.440 --> 52:15.120]  Ish, ish, okay.
[52:15.120 --> 52:16.240]  I would almost agree with that.
[52:16.240 --> 52:18.400]  I'd say, yeah, I said five was my first guess.
[52:18.400 --> 52:20.360]  I was gonna say five or 10 and you gave me six.
[52:20.360 --> 52:23.640]  So yeah, and then just imagine
[52:23.640 --> 52:25.520]  that you're gonna be six times higher.
[52:25.520 --> 52:27.280]  When you take a dab, you're gonna be six times higher
[52:27.280 --> 52:29.760]  than when you smoke that one hit of weed that you smoke.
[52:29.760 --> 52:31.240]  And we don't know what kind of weed you're smoking.
[52:31.640 --> 52:32.480]  Are you smoking high grade weed?
[52:32.480 --> 52:34.280]  You smoking Mexican brick weed?
[52:34.280 --> 52:35.800]  If you're smoking Mexican brick weed
[52:35.800 --> 52:37.320]  and you step up to a dab,
[52:37.320 --> 52:40.040]  it's going to be a game fucking changer.
[52:40.040 --> 52:41.680]  One thing to mention,
[52:41.680 --> 52:44.120]  the dabs will ruin your tolerance for weed.
[52:44.120 --> 52:44.960]  If you start regularly.
[52:44.960 --> 52:45.920]  They can for sure.
[52:45.920 --> 52:48.320]  Yeah, I can smoke all the joints.
[52:48.320 --> 52:50.480]  If you've got joints, I'll smoke them all.
[52:50.480 --> 52:52.560]  Like bring them and we'll smoke them.
[52:52.560 --> 52:54.680]  I'll get cotton mouth and I'll get a sore throat eventually,
[52:54.680 --> 52:55.880]  but I won't get stoned.
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.080]  Then I'll go take a dab and I'll be high as a motherfucker.
[52:59.080 --> 53:01.120]  It'll kick all the joints in.
[53:01.960 --> 53:04.960]  I have to be really careful with my hash consumption
[53:04.960 --> 53:07.200]  or I'll ruin flowers for myself for a while.
[53:08.360 --> 53:10.760]  And I fix that with just a quick little vacation.
[53:10.760 --> 53:12.760]  I like to smoke flowers at concerts and stuff.
[53:12.760 --> 53:14.280]  And I smoke a lot of flowers.
[53:14.280 --> 53:16.080]  Flowers still my favorite way to go.
[53:16.080 --> 53:17.280]  It's flowers in a bong.
[53:17.280 --> 53:18.200]  It's the way it all started.
[53:18.200 --> 53:19.560]  Flowers in a bong, man.
[53:19.560 --> 53:21.600]  I was smoking flowers in a bong a little while back.
[53:21.600 --> 53:22.440]  I'm old, man.
[53:22.440 --> 53:23.800]  My lungs don't work anymore.
[53:23.800 --> 53:24.640]  That's hard.
[53:25.520 --> 53:26.360]  It's funny.
[53:26.360 --> 53:27.920]  My lungs like the bong hit a lot more
[53:27.920 --> 53:29.200]  than they like the dab hit.
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.040]  I can tell.
[53:30.280 --> 53:31.480]  Because I'm a smoker,
[53:31.480 --> 53:34.480]  my lungs have been trained for fuck 20 years.
[53:34.480 --> 53:36.360]  Did we tell this guy to expect coughing?
[53:36.360 --> 53:37.200]  Did we mention that?
[53:37.200 --> 53:38.320]  You're gonna cough.
[53:38.320 --> 53:39.160]  Uncomfortable.
[53:39.160 --> 53:41.320]  You just heard Mike cough for a long time.
[53:41.320 --> 53:43.320]  Your throat's designed to prevent you
[53:43.320 --> 53:44.960]  from doing what you're trying to do with it.
[53:44.960 --> 53:47.760]  If you are a cigarette smoker,
[53:47.760 --> 53:49.520]  it's going to increase your coughing.
[53:49.520 --> 53:51.520]  You notice I don't cough when I dab.
[53:51.520 --> 53:53.400]  My friend Elijah, he doesn't cough when he dab.
[53:53.400 --> 53:54.400]  We don't smoke cigarettes.
[53:54.400 --> 53:56.360]  Mike and James, they cough like sons of bitches
[53:56.360 --> 53:57.400]  when they dab and they both,
[53:57.400 --> 53:59.040]  Brian coughs.
[53:59.080 --> 54:00.240]  You guys all smoke cigarettes?
[54:00.240 --> 54:01.080]  I can feel it.
[54:01.080 --> 54:03.640]  Because it's not just when I dab.
[54:03.640 --> 54:05.720]  When I hit a vape of any kind,
[54:05.720 --> 54:10.240]  even the little oil stick or whatever,
[54:10.240 --> 54:11.680]  hash cartridges,
[54:11.680 --> 54:14.400]  when I hit one of those or a nicotine vape
[54:14.400 --> 54:16.560]  or even one of the little electronic cigarettes
[54:16.560 --> 54:17.800]  that you get at the gas stations.
[54:17.800 --> 54:18.640]  Rattles looser.
[54:18.640 --> 54:23.640]  I feel the same pressure or burn or tightness
[54:23.800 --> 54:25.960]  that causes the cough when I dab.
[54:25.960 --> 54:28.880]  It's the heated liquid vapor versus a smoke.
[54:29.720 --> 54:31.160]  Just jar and loose all your tar lung.
[54:31.160 --> 54:32.320]  It's totally different.
[54:32.320 --> 54:33.160]  Yummy.
[54:33.160 --> 54:35.760]  It's like water and air going through a hose.
[54:35.760 --> 54:36.960]  This dude asked,
[54:36.960 --> 54:39.800]  would you recommend that I attempt to up my tolerance?
[54:39.800 --> 54:41.600]  And if so, how?
[54:41.600 --> 54:43.360]  I would not at all recommend that.
[54:43.360 --> 54:44.320]  Yeah, you're a cheap date.
[54:44.320 --> 54:45.600]  Stay that way.
[54:45.600 --> 54:50.200]  Right, like I can recommend you spend more on dinners too.
[54:51.160 --> 54:53.040]  Yeah, right now it doesn't cost you a lot to get high.
[54:53.040 --> 54:54.360]  It's easier to conceal.
[54:54.360 --> 54:56.520]  You could wear more expensive shoes.
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.000]  No, no, no.
[54:58.000 --> 55:01.000]  There's no reason to push your tolerance further up.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.320]  When you start dabbing, it's going to do it itself.
[55:03.320 --> 55:04.880]  So don't dab too frequently
[55:04.880 --> 55:06.320]  and then just keep your stash of,
[55:06.320 --> 55:07.680]  don't buy dabs maybe.
[55:07.680 --> 55:09.720]  Only dab when your buddy dabs you out,
[55:09.720 --> 55:10.600]  which is a dick move,
[55:10.600 --> 55:12.320]  but I mean if you don't buy it,
[55:12.320 --> 55:14.200]  then you don't have it there to just become a dab head.
[55:14.200 --> 55:16.000]  You're not always dabbing.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.480]  I'm just kind of enjoying the thought
[55:18.480 --> 55:20.080]  of what it would be like to be able to get
[55:20.080 --> 55:22.120]  to where I'd wanna be after a hit or two.
[55:23.040 --> 55:24.680]  Like how much cheaper that would be,
[55:24.680 --> 55:27.400]  how much time I would save that way.
[55:28.240 --> 55:30.040]  Like even when I'm dabbing,
[55:30.040 --> 55:34.600]  because I'm a smoker and my lungs can't handle giant dabs,
[55:34.600 --> 55:36.560]  I've gotta sit down and take three or four,
[55:36.560 --> 55:38.600]  which means I've gotta heat the nail three or four times,
[55:38.600 --> 55:40.720]  wait for the dab to cool three or four times,
[55:40.720 --> 55:43.000]  get distracted three or four times,
[55:43.000 --> 55:44.960]  and all of a sudden an hour and a half's gone by
[55:44.960 --> 55:47.040]  and I've gotten baked once.
[55:47.040 --> 55:49.240]  Like if I could take a puff, be fried,
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.160]  and be back to doing whatever it was,
[55:53.160 --> 55:55.360]  that would be preferable.
[55:55.360 --> 55:57.480]  That's why I take one giant dab.
[55:57.480 --> 55:59.760]  There's something happens,
[55:59.760 --> 56:02.680]  something happens to me when I take one big gigantic dab
[56:02.680 --> 56:04.400]  that doesn't happen when I take six
[56:04.400 --> 56:05.800]  or seven little tiny dabs.
[56:05.800 --> 56:07.480]  Just doesn't do it.
[56:07.480 --> 56:10.020]  One big dab really just does it for me.
[56:11.640 --> 56:12.960]  It's different for everybody.
[56:12.960 --> 56:14.200]  And honestly with cannabis,
[56:14.200 --> 56:16.560]  there's so many different ways to consume it.
[56:16.560 --> 56:17.920]  Just playing with the different ones
[56:17.920 --> 56:19.160]  and finding your favorite.
[56:20.320 --> 56:23.360]  And it's a little harder where you are versus where we are.
[56:23.360 --> 56:24.400]  True, true.
[56:26.040 --> 56:28.080]  Dude, I was gonna say, that's why I got a little quiet.
[56:28.080 --> 56:29.640]  I was trying to remember what the fuck I was gonna say.
[56:29.640 --> 56:32.440]  Do you notice that back in the day
[56:32.440 --> 56:34.640]  when you smoked and went to work,
[56:34.640 --> 56:36.960]  not to say that we might take dabs and go to work now.
[56:36.960 --> 56:37.780]  I never did that.
[56:37.780 --> 56:39.000]  I can't answer this question.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.360]  Okay, hypothetically.
[56:40.360 --> 56:41.720]  No, you don't have these jobs anymore
[56:41.720 --> 56:43.680]  and you don't fucking work there, so fuck those places.
[56:43.680 --> 56:44.840]  When you worked at places before
[56:44.840 --> 56:46.560]  when you weren't allowed to smoke,
[56:46.560 --> 56:48.120]  when you walked in there,
[56:48.120 --> 56:50.480]  did you just feel fucking super high?
[56:50.480 --> 56:52.820]  Like you're like, I'm not supposed to be high at work.
[56:52.820 --> 56:54.400]  I'm really high suddenly.
[56:54.400 --> 56:58.120]  And now that it's okay to show up for work
[56:58.120 --> 57:00.200]  medicated so that you're not in pain
[57:00.200 --> 57:02.480]  and nobody judges you and nobody cares,
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.020]  does it affect your level of highness or medication-ness?
[57:08.540 --> 57:11.040]  It affects my anxiety level around it.
[57:11.040 --> 57:13.440]  Okay, yeah, I think that's what I'm getting at.
[57:14.840 --> 57:19.640]  To be honest, because I'm in an environment
[57:19.640 --> 57:22.040]  where I can be honest with my boss
[57:22.040 --> 57:24.040]  that I took this cannabis product
[57:24.040 --> 57:26.600]  or that cannabis product this morning,
[57:26.600 --> 57:29.560]  work a full shift, do my job as expected,
[57:29.560 --> 57:33.940]  I didn't go home, everybody's fine, nobody gives a shit.
[57:35.400 --> 57:40.360]  I find myself more concerned with making sure
[57:40.360 --> 57:41.800]  it's never an issue.
[57:41.800 --> 57:42.640]  Okay.
[57:43.640 --> 57:47.880]  I would feel worse being too baked
[57:47.880 --> 57:49.860]  to do what I needed to do now
[57:49.860 --> 57:52.500]  than I would have at the coat store when I was 18.
[57:52.500 --> 57:53.740]  All right. Does that make sense?
[57:53.740 --> 57:55.380]  Yeah, no, I'm kind of the same way.
[57:55.380 --> 57:56.220]  Like, well, I'm the boss,
[57:56.220 --> 57:58.540]  so I make sure not to get fucking blown out baked.
[57:58.540 --> 58:01.540]  But like, yeah, I still pay more attention
[58:01.540 --> 58:04.460]  and I'm like, yeah, they don't get mad at us.
[58:04.460 --> 58:06.700]  They know if they know that we're smoking,
[58:06.700 --> 58:07.740]  nobody's said anything.
[58:07.740 --> 58:09.060]  I don't know they even do,
[58:09.060 --> 58:10.900]  but nobody's fucking called us out on it.
[58:10.900 --> 58:12.740]  And so like, they know that we're all
[58:12.740 --> 58:13.940]  medical marijuana patients.
[58:13.940 --> 58:16.960]  So like, we work hard and nobody's calling us out
[58:16.960 --> 58:18.700]  for not having sore knees.
[58:18.740 --> 58:20.860]  And so I make sure not to just be ripped
[58:20.860 --> 58:21.700]  when I show up or something.
[58:21.700 --> 58:24.820]  Right, like what we do is body intensive.
[58:24.820 --> 58:26.740]  Being able to do it for eight hours a day,
[58:26.740 --> 58:27.780]  five days a week.
[58:27.780 --> 58:30.380]  I deal with all the contractors and the city people,
[58:30.380 --> 58:31.820]  so I can't be blown out.
[58:31.820 --> 58:32.660]  I don't need that.
[58:32.660 --> 58:34.220]  I don't need to represent our company all,
[58:34.220 --> 58:35.780]  hey, what's up, bro?
[58:35.780 --> 58:39.140]  I'm gonna try to be bright eyed, white eyed,
[58:39.140 --> 58:40.460]  mostly ready to rock.
[58:40.460 --> 58:41.660]  My favorites when I've been in a grow
[58:41.660 --> 58:43.220]  and I'm like balls deep in a project
[58:43.220 --> 58:44.580]  and a contractor rings the doorbell
[58:44.580 --> 58:45.940]  and I answer the door and I'm like,
[58:45.940 --> 58:46.940]  what's up other human?
[58:46.940 --> 58:49.020]  I haven't seen other humans in like seven hours.
[58:49.020 --> 58:49.860]  It's good to see it.
[58:49.860 --> 58:51.060]  And they're like, hey,
[58:51.060 --> 58:52.740]  they just look at me like I'm fucking a caveman.
[58:52.740 --> 58:53.580]  It's so funny.
[58:53.580 --> 58:56.720]  When I was working strictly the retail side,
[58:58.100 --> 59:00.900]  you don't carry that wonderful odor with you so much
[59:00.900 --> 59:02.740]  when you go to lunch.
[59:02.740 --> 59:05.240]  I was standing at line at fucking subway today
[59:05.240 --> 59:07.540]  and I look up and I look around
[59:07.540 --> 59:08.380]  and there's a little line.
[59:08.380 --> 59:09.980]  You had to chill for a minute.
[59:09.980 --> 59:10.900]  I didn't have to do anything.
[59:10.900 --> 59:11.980]  So I'm playing with my phone.
[59:11.980 --> 59:13.940]  I look up and I'm getting weird looks
[59:13.940 --> 59:15.380]  from like seven people.
[59:15.380 --> 59:17.020]  So the first thing I do is glance down
[59:17.020 --> 59:18.500]  and I'm like, nope, flies closed.
[59:18.500 --> 59:19.340]  What the fuck?
[59:20.660 --> 59:21.820]  Oh, I get it.
[59:21.820 --> 59:24.100]  I smell fucking awesome.
[59:24.100 --> 59:26.340]  And they're all wondering if I'm too high to talk
[59:26.340 --> 59:27.700]  or if I work with it.
[59:27.700 --> 59:28.540]  Yep.
[59:30.620 --> 59:33.380]  I showed up to a restaurant in Colorado Springs
[59:33.380 --> 59:34.860]  where you order at a window
[59:34.860 --> 59:36.580]  and then you sit down and they bring your food out to you
[59:36.580 --> 59:39.220]  and we ordered and we paid
[59:39.220 --> 59:40.260]  and the guy goes, all right,
[59:40.260 --> 59:41.300]  you'll be sitting outside, right?
[59:41.300 --> 59:42.640]  We'll bring that right to you.
[59:42.640 --> 59:44.140]  And it was fucking snowing, dude.
[59:44.140 --> 59:46.140]  And we're like, no, I'm sitting outside.
[59:46.140 --> 59:46.980]  What the fuck?
[59:46.980 --> 59:49.540]  And they're like, oh, we really can't have you guys in here.
[59:49.540 --> 59:50.380]  And I kind of looked at him
[59:50.380 --> 59:52.180]  and the person that was with me looked at me like,
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.100]  and they're like, so do you not like fucking dreadlocks
[59:54.100 --> 59:55.660]  or what's the fucking problem?
[59:55.660 --> 59:57.620]  Because that was the only issue we could spot like you.
[59:57.620 --> 59:58.740]  I got to check the fly.
[59:58.740 --> 59:59.780]  I got cash.
[59:59.780 --> 01:00:00.620]  Everything's cool here.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.380]  Wearing pants, why are you offended?
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:03.620]  Yeah, I got shirt, I got shoes.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:05.100]  I want fucking service.
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.260]  I'm fucking, I got money in my hand.
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:08.780]  And they're like, no, you'll have to sit outside.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.440]  You guys reek of marijuana.
[01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.660]  And I was like, oh, sorry.
[01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:13.820]  Can we get our money back?
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.340]  And they're like, what?
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.180]  And I was like, if we have to sit outside
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.100]  in the fucking snow, we're not eating here.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.980]  And if you don't appreciate how I earned my money
[01:00:18.980 --> 01:00:21.260]  at my job today, I'm not fucking spending my money here.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:23.620]  Please give me a full refund for all of our orders.
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.740]  And we did not eat at that motherfucking place.
[01:00:25.740 --> 01:00:28.260]  I hear people bitching about the smell
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:30.140]  and smelling on people who work with it
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:32.580]  while they're in line, like shopping for groceries
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.860]  or going about their life or taking money to the bank.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:40.340]  And I always sort of chuckle and wonder if people
[01:00:40.340 --> 01:00:42.780]  that work in other industries that produce an odor,
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:43.980]  if there are people in their town
[01:00:43.980 --> 01:00:46.660]  that are like fucking fish market people.
[01:00:46.660 --> 01:00:48.340]  Right, well, I'm sure if the fucking,
[01:00:48.340 --> 01:00:50.380]  the plumber that smelled like a doo-doo walked by,
[01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:52.060]  you're like, god damn, he smells like a doo-doo.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:56.060]  I lived near a town that was famous for its odor
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:57.940]  because of a specific industry.
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:58.780]  Really?
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.600]  Yep.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.440]  Damn, I'm good.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.820]  I don't remember anybody being like
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:03.860]  motherfucking dog food workers.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:04.700]  Right.
[01:01:04.700 --> 01:01:07.860]  Like, nah, the dog food plant took all the heat.
[01:01:07.860 --> 01:01:09.260]  Yeah, literally.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:11.580]  The people that worked there,
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.460]  no one was pissed at them.
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:15.420]  No one was like, man, I was at fucking Walmart
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.660]  the other day, the dude in front of me
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.540]  fucking reeked dog food.
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:20.340]  That's not even the dog food, it's the,
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.020]  bleh, I can't even describe that smell.
[01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:23.860]  It's horrible.
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:25.860]  Like, it just never, it never came up
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.260]  in any other aspect of my life.
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:29.480]  And I know there are other industries where,
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.100]  because what you're doing produces a heavy smell,
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.700]  does everyone in your town bitch
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:36.680]  about people smelling like that?
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.900]  I don't know, email me, tweet me.
[01:01:38.900 --> 01:01:40.340]  At NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:41.180]  If you're still listening.
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.260]  This guy's still listening at least,
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.380]  because he sent us an email and he gives a lot of shit.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.980]  Thanks for listening, man.
[01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.460]  So no, our bottom line is do not increase your tolerance.
[01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:51.600]  Stay a cheap date, it's fun.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.020]  Maybe sometimes on Friday, take three or four puffs,
[01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:55.260]  see what you can do.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:57.260]  But don't try to step it up just to step it up
[01:01:57.260 --> 01:01:59.340]  for the sake of stepping it up.
[01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:00.740]  That's not necessary.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:02.300]  Let's talk about your music selections here.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.380]  It all sucks, you're a loser.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.500]  No, I'm totally kidding, dude.
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.580]  I'm almost 40 years old.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.260]  And your music selection, like Mike said,
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.140]  that's all up to you.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:11.500]  I don't give a shit what people think
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:12.820]  about my music selection.
[01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:15.500]  Dude, I will listen to, on the same car ride,
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.500]  I'll listen to Phish, I'll listen to Journey,
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:19.060]  and then I'll listen to fucking Snoop Dogg
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:20.740]  on the same car ride.
[01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:22.900]  There was a spot in like my early 20s
[01:02:22.900 --> 01:02:25.860]  where I stopped caring what I was listening to
[01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.060]  in a way that other people would consider.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:28.900]  Yeah.
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.540]  Like when I was a teenager and I was bumping
[01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.380]  to something I knew that I liked that wasn't popular,
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:35.260]  and I'm coming to a stoplight where other people
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.980]  are gonna be able to both hear and identify me,
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:40.820]  I'd turn that down and just enjoy it quietly
[01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:41.700]  with my windows up.
[01:02:41.700 --> 01:02:45.060]  And when we were doing 55 again, I'd pump it back up.
[01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.940]  Now, fuck it, I'll let you listen
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:48.980]  to whatever the fuck I'm listening to if you want.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.260]  Oh yeah, if you're riding next to me,
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.780]  you get to hear the reggae channel on Sirius XM
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:53.620]  most of the time.
[01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:55.420]  If it makes you happy, turn it up.
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.700]  I was listening to Joey Diaz's podcast,
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.700]  Uncle Joey, the Church of What's Happening Now,
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:03.220]  and I was in traffic, like near where I live,
[01:03:03.220 --> 01:03:06.460]  there's a street where traffic is fucked in the morning.
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:08.780]  Okay, normally it takes me 15 minutes to get it to work.
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.340]  I left 35 minutes earlier that day
[01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:11.580]  and I was still fucking late.
[01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.740]  So that's how the construction and the traffic are.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:16.860]  Joey Diaz was just cussing up a fucking storm
[01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:18.500]  about something, and I look over
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.500]  and the little half-tard with the fucking flag
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.300]  that's waving everyone to slow down is staring at my car,
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.460]  like, what is that guy fucking listening to?
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.340]  It was so funny.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.100]  I didn't care, I didn't change anything,
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.500]  but I just thought it was because Joey Diaz
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.860]  will let it out.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:33.700]  Joey Diaz will call you a cocksucker
[01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.060]  and go off for 10 minutes, and it was hilarious.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:37.940]  I was listening to a podcast today,
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:40.460]  and when it ended, the next one in my queue came up,
[01:03:40.460 --> 01:03:43.620]  and it was a Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes podcast
[01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:45.460]  that was particularly filthy,
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.020]  and I let it roll for about half an hour
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:49.380]  before it clicked that I was at work.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.380]  Maybe find another podcast.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.980]  You can listen to that where you are.
[01:03:52.980 --> 01:03:53.820]  It's just fine.
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:56.820]  Yes, we listen to Wheeler Walker Jr. at work sometimes.
[01:03:56.820 --> 01:03:58.140]  So let's get back into this dude's email,
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.020]  because we've been recording for an hour and four minutes.
[01:04:00.020 --> 01:04:01.260]  Dude, it was a kick-ass email.
[01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:02.340]  We had to go off on it.
[01:04:02.340 --> 01:04:03.900]  He says, I'm a huge fan of music.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.500]  My tastes have grown to be more eclectic
[01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.780]  since high school.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.620]  Then he talks about my friends,
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.540]  and I used to cruise around in my car
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.340]  and smoke and listen to Slipknot and similar,
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:12.940]  occasionally pausing for an in-car mosh.
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:14.100]  Like I said earlier, dude,
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:16.660]  I was a teenager and I was into Metallica.
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:18.060]  I got into Pantera.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:19.740]  I dabbled into the Cannibal Corpse,
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:21.700]  D-side type of shit for a minute,
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.260]  and then when I started heavily smoking cannabis,
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:27.780]  my music tastes changed drastically.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.660]  I started the Nine Inch Nails Primus sort of thing,
[01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.420]  and then I went to an REM concert,
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.420]  and I thought I was a huge REM fan,
[01:04:34.420 --> 01:04:38.100]  and then I was listening to a lot of different stuff.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.380]  You went 311 route, is the route Mike went?
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:43.860]  And then my first 311 show I was in for life.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.820]  I'd listened to The Grateful Dead sporadically,
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:47.900]  but my friend Greg introduced me to The Grateful Dead,
[01:04:47.900 --> 01:04:49.980]  and then he took me to a Phish show at Red Rocks,
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:51.340]  and all hell broke loose.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:52.220]  That's how that happened.
[01:04:52.220 --> 01:04:54.740]  So I never got into the heavy stuff.
[01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:55.660]  This is funny, y'all.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.140]  Right before I found 311 and my life changed forever,
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:01.700]  the CD that I was most hyped to buy that summer
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.340]  was fucking So For Real.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.700]  Yeah, you heard it here first.
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.580]  You admitted that on a podcast.
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.140]  Just like what you like, yo.
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:12.340]  The student says now he enjoys some rap and reggae,
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.900]  which is right up my alley.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:17.340]  He says he's been listening to the I Revibes channel,
[01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:20.460]  which is, and then he selected his favorites,
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.700]  which is Revolution, Stick Figure, Tribal Seeds,
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:24.980]  and Dirty Heads, which is all acceptable reggae.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.700]  I call that white boy surf dub or surf reggae.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:29.260]  That's good stuff.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:33.500]  I like more of the Jamaican reggae stuff most of the time,
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:35.740]  but if you're listening to Stick Figure and Revolution,
[01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:36.620]  you're already doing it, right?
[01:05:36.620 --> 01:05:38.260]  You're gonna be just fine.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.860]  Those are up to par.
[01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:41.860]  You keep meaning to listen to the Mystic Roots, man.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:42.700]  No pressure, bro.
[01:05:42.700 --> 01:05:43.520]  Check them out.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.360]  You're gonna love it.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.100]  They've got a lot of good stuff, old stuff and new stuff.
[01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:50.700]  On Mystic Roots, get yourself a bowl, fire it up,
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.860]  pull up YouTube, and do Mystic Roots, Pass the Marijuana,
[01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.940]  turn it up, sit back, close your eyes,
[01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:58.000]  and just enjoy the next seven minutes.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.460]  That song's probably 10 years old.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:02.300]  It's fucking amazing.
[01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.940]  I make sure to get it at least once a week in my list.
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:06.420]  And then check out some of the newer stuff
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:08.140]  with Catherine singing,
[01:06:08.140 --> 01:06:09.860]  with Catherine Ramirez on vocals now,
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:12.100]  because she wasn't with the band back in the day,
[01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.580]  and they've had some lineup changes over the years,
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:16.900]  and Kat sings, and it's a totally different vibe.
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:17.740]  I fucking dig it.
[01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:19.100]  Go see them live if they come near you.
[01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.820]  They tour a lot.
[01:06:20.820 --> 01:06:22.020]  So I'm gonna keep moving on the email.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.660]  We are a rambly pair of stoners tonight.
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:29.720]  Bro, you mentioned you smoke and grab your sketchbook.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:30.620]  What do you draw, man?
[01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:32.740]  I wanna see some of your art.
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.560]  If you're kind enough to share, I would appreciate it.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:36.400]  Show me what you got.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.700]  I used to draw when I was a youngster.
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:40.400]  I feel like I lost my passion for art for some reason.
[01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.260]  Let's see.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:45.300]  Dude, medical use, recreational use is medical use.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:46.300]  I completely agree.
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.620]  That's a great statement.
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:49.220]  Thank you for saying that.
[01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:50.740]  Anything that makes you feel better, man.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.500]  And I'm sure you got some PTSD or something
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:53.860]  from being in the military.
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.380]  I'm sure something hurts, and you're a parent,
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.780]  so sometimes you just need an escape
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.940]  without even going anywhere.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.220]  You still gotta be there.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:04.460]  So it is, it's medical.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:05.300]  Let's see.
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.820]  He also says, thanks for listening to a rambling man.
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.140]  Dude, thanks for the great email
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:10.740]  because you gave us like an hour worth of solid material.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:11.640]  So that's awesome.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.260]  Thanks for everything you do in state.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:16.820]  I read Arachnid Death, and then I wanna deal with the PS.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:17.860]  I wanna take a special moment.
[01:07:17.860 --> 01:07:20.220]  Thank you for sharing your experience with TBI.
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:22.580]  You could tell sharing like that was difficult.
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.220]  Dude, it was a little bit difficult.
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.540]  I tried to hide it, but there's a couple spots
[01:07:26.540 --> 01:07:27.380]  where my voice shaked.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.780]  I was like, do I wanna share this much about myself?
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:31.780]  I appreciate you guys for listening,
[01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:33.820]  so I felt like I just needed to be as honest
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:35.660]  as I could with you because what's the point
[01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:37.980]  of recording a show if you don't make it honest and real?
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:38.960]  It's called Grow From Your Heart,
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.820]  so I did it all from my heart on that.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:42.540]  Hey, Arachnid Death, thank you so much
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:43.860]  for your military service.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.860]  Thank you for returning to the team, Cannabis.
[01:07:45.860 --> 01:07:47.420]  We like having you on the green team.
[01:07:47.420 --> 01:07:49.920]  And also, thank you for the huge, great email.
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:50.860]  I appreciate that.
[01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:53.260]  I hope we gave you some useful advice.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.620]  Don't increase your intake just to be on the cool team.
[01:07:57.620 --> 01:07:58.860]  Go slow with the dabs.
[01:07:58.860 --> 01:08:00.300]  Don't go too hot.
[01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.020]  It should be.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:03.580]  That's a mistake that we made
[01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:06.320]  that you can definitely learn from and avoid.
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.780]  We used to think you had to go real hot back in the day.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:11.580]  It doesn't matter what you're hitting,
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.820]  what type of tip is on your nectar collector
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.820]  that you're using, or what type of nail
[01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:18.300]  or banger setup you end up seeing.
[01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:20.180]  If it's glowing, it's too hot.
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:21.540]  Yes, let it cool a little bit.
[01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:23.560]  I know I'm gonna get some glow squad hate for that,
[01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:24.620]  but y'all are nuts.
[01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:27.020]  Hashtag glow squad, shout out to Mickey Martin.
[01:08:27.860 --> 01:08:29.220]  Yep.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.060]  That killed it, Mike Wentz.
[01:08:30.060 --> 01:08:31.300]  Killer email.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:32.140]  That was awesome.
[01:08:32.140 --> 01:08:32.960]  Such a good email.
[01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:33.800]  Man, I appreciate it.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.540]  If you've got any more questions, please send them to me.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.420]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.340]  You guys, I have got a stack of emails on my desk.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:43.340]  I just can't get through all of them in one episode.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.180]  Your email is coming up.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.020]  I'm not helping.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:49.180]  I'm making sure we only get to one email per show.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:50.820]  Yeah, Mike won't be here all the time.
[01:08:50.820 --> 01:08:51.660]  Don't worry, we'll get more messages done.
[01:08:51.660 --> 01:08:52.500]  They like it when we ramble.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:53.380]  Mike, thanks for coming, man.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:55.860]  You make a good podcast, you add some conversation.
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:08:57.060]  It's not just me talking.
[01:08:57.060 --> 01:08:57.900]  This was a good show.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.060]  We had fun, we took some dabs, we made some friends.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:01.900]  Yeah.
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:04.580]  Dude, we both needed it, getting out and doing a good show.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:05.820]  Feels good, it's cathartic.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:08.220]  It's fun hanging out, not at work, not on the clock.
[01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:09.780]  Yep.
[01:09:09.780 --> 01:09:11.620]  Dude, welcome to the team, officially.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:13.300]  It feels good to be on a good team again.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.300]  I appreciate that.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:16.660]  I'm glad you see the potential in that team.
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:17.980]  You guys, if you ever have,
[01:09:17.980 --> 01:09:19.460]  if you've ever been out there and you're just like,
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:22.500]  oh, this works well, this is well thought out, I like this.
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.140]  Like, I've had that experience all week.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:24.980]  It's been awesome.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:27.820]  I feel blessed to be on the team now.
[01:09:27.820 --> 01:09:31.300]  So yeah, if you're listening, thank you.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.900]  Yeah, Mike is the one trimming that weed this week.
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:36.140]  That's when you're a new guy, we make you trim for a week.
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.620]  So he's trimming buds.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:41.060]  So tell us what you think of the trim job.
[01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:45.060]  Right, feel free to critique me at NemoPunk15 on Twitter.
[01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:45.900]  Yeah.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.380]  All right, you guys, we should probably wrap up
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:50.140]  this podcast, we've been going for an hour and 10 minutes.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:51.380]  Dude, once again, Mike, thanks for coming,
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.860]  taking time away from the little guy.
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:54.780]  Taking time away from the wife,
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.780]  time away from your fucking pack of dogs.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.940]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:09:59.980]  And the new house, you got all kinds of good shit going on.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.540]  Yeah, I've got a lot of things going on.
[01:10:01.540 --> 01:10:02.860]  That's why it was so nice to get over here
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:05.020]  and just do a good show and chill for a minute.
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.820]  Take some dabs.
[01:10:06.820 --> 01:10:09.980]  Ben, thanks to everybody for listening, I appreciate it.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:11.380]  It's fun hanging out with everybody,
[01:10:11.380 --> 01:10:12.940]  giving everybody some grow advice.
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:14.820]  I feel like we're all friends now.
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:15.740]  It's awesome.

[01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.220]  Mike, you got anything to say
[01:11:42.220 --> 01:11:45.780]  before we wrap up this hour and 15 minute podcast?
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:48.700]  Keep the emails coming folks.
[01:11:48.700 --> 01:11:50.580]  Honestly, that was an amazing email.
[01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.580]  There are a lot of great emails in the pile.
[01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.260]  We just can't get through them because Mike talks a lot.
[01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:56.220]  Lots of great points.
[01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:58.620]  Honestly, when I go back and listen to shows,
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:02.060]  the ones with listener generated content
[01:12:02.060 --> 01:12:04.020]  where somebody has a specific question,
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.540]  those tend to be the shows that I find myself
[01:12:07.540 --> 01:12:09.300]  really getting into a third time.
[01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.300]  Cool, a third time.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.500]  You listen three times?
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.220]  You listed off all the shit I got going right now.
[01:12:15.220 --> 01:12:19.020]  I can only take fucking Pandora for so many hours a day.
[01:12:19.020 --> 01:12:20.500]  I end up going through podcasts
[01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:24.340]  and I'll burn through an entire run of a podcast in a week.
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.300]  Nice, nice.
[01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:26.700]  I think I'm listening to too many shows
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.380]  because I can't get them all in.
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.700]  When you're going 18 hours a day
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:31.500]  and there's always something playing in the background,
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.460]  you just burn through a lot of fucking content.
[01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:34.500]  Very true.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.420]  Hey, I hope you guys are enjoying the Thursday episodes
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:37.260]  I'm putting out.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:39.900]  I've been putting out big old chunks of Thursday episodes.
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.700]  Thanks for asking.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.740]  I've been trying to get like five episodes.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:46.780]  Dude, that three, three and a half hour chunk.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.420]  Yeah, does that not fuck up your phone?
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:49.620]  Does that not mess up your data?
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.140]  Is everything legit with that?
[01:12:51.140 --> 01:12:53.420]  I'm on wifi constantly.
[01:12:53.420 --> 01:12:56.020]  I'm never off wifi long enough for that to fuck with me.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:56.900]  Cool, I just didn't.
[01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:59.220]  I've got an iPhone and I've got the unlimited plan.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:00.220]  That's funny.
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.260]  I got an offer for the internet company
[01:13:02.260 --> 01:13:05.940]  who used to fuck me with that particular trick.
[01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.260]  So I feel for people who have to deal with data
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:09.100]  and stuff like that.
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:11.500]  But yeah, be careful which episode you download.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.980]  Yeah, some of them are three hours.
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:14.340]  The Thursday episodes can get long,
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:16.340]  but man, I love that big fat chunk of content.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:18.220]  I save them as a smaller file.
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.780]  They're not as high quality.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.620]  So they're the same size file as a short episode
[01:13:23.620 --> 01:13:28.200]  because they're not saved as a Apple enhanced podcast file.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.940]  I just save them as a shitty MP3.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.380]  For the start of the show, the original topic,
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:36.260]  old shows deep in the playlist,
[01:13:36.260 --> 01:13:40.900]  we've covered everything you're gonna find in a girl book
[01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:42.220]  two or three different ways.
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.300]  Oh yeah.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.260]  If you like the show and you don't like reading,
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.100]  you can dig through old episodes
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:50.540]  and learn everything you need to know
[01:13:50.540 --> 01:13:52.540]  to be a really successful grower.
[01:13:52.540 --> 01:13:55.620]  And I've currently got the first 65 episodes available
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.880]  on my YouTube channel at Grow From Your Heart on YouTube.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:13:58.820]  I don't know how to find it.
[01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:00.300]  It's like, just go to YouTube
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.740]  and search for Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:02.580]  It'll come up.
[01:14:02.580 --> 01:14:04.860]  There's a playlist of the first 20
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:07.720]  that's borrowed from the iRegionetics YouTube channel,
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.800]  which doesn't do shit anymore.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:10.220]  There's nothing up there.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:12.500]  But the playlist is there.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:14.980]  And then the other 45 are there
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.260]  on the Grow From Your Heart channel.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.200]  So you can watch the first 60 episodes.
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:19.540]  You guys, it's not video of me.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:21.980]  It's just screenshots of random shit.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:23.100]  But all of the audio is there.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:23.940]  So you can listen to every episode.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:28.540]  I wanna say like 33 to 36 and like 40 to 50.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:32.100]  Up into the 70s, there are a lot of great episodes.
[01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.820]  There are episodes where we sit down
[01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:36.260]  and the show starts off with Get Your Pen.
[01:14:36.260 --> 01:14:38.000]  Yeah, well, I've written entire,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.140]  I've typed out entire seven or eight,
[01:14:40.140 --> 01:14:41.940]  10 page fucking podcasts.
[01:14:41.940 --> 01:14:44.380]  Yep, where we get hyper specific
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:46.300]  with every step of the process.
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:47.740]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.220]  There's a series where Jeff brought in
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:53.100]  different experts in each little piece
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.380]  and interviewed them that's just incredible
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:58.060]  and insanely informative.
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.000]  I'll have to get back to that one of these days.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.980]  When we get more time to.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:05.980]  We legalized it and we all got ridiculously busy.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:07.760]  Got these huge jobs now.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.020]  You guys, I haven't, yeah, nevermind.
[01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:12.660]  I'm getting a lot more lights real soon.
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:13.900]  I'm building a whole nother facility
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:15.260]  that's gonna be overwhelming.
[01:15:15.260 --> 01:15:16.080]  I can't fucking wait.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:16.980]  I'm excited to be overwhelmed.
[01:15:16.980 --> 01:15:19.020]  Overwhelmed is my favorite way to be lately.
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:21.180]  Not to overstate it, but we could do
[01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:23.100]  a demolition derby in the space.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.140]  The same building we were building a grow in
[01:15:27.140 --> 01:15:29.500]  recently hosted a dodgeball tournament,
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.100]  a what's it called, roller derby,
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:33.900]  and what else was happening in there?
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.340]  There were like three or four events in the building
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:38.220]  because the grow hasn't been built in there yet.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.060]  It's just an empty building right now.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.580]  We're just taking it over now, yeah.
[01:15:40.580 --> 01:15:43.500]  But the former tenants did a fucking roller derby thing
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:45.540]  in there, a dodgeball event.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:47.700]  It's huge and we're gonna fill it with lights pretty soon.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:49.180]  The plans are there, it's in action.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:50.940]  So I don't know how much of that shit I'm supposed to spill.
[01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:52.380]  That's not my business to share.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:54.440]  So thank you guys for listening
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.060]  to all that private information.
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:15:58.180]  I'm not gonna edit it, bro.
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:15:59.060]  Nobody gives a shit.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.100]  That's cool.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:01.260]  Mike just gave me the edit that.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:03.620]  And I'm like, no, this podcast, we're cool.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:04.980]  We're all friends here.
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:06.060]  Don't tell anybody.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:06.900]  It's a secret.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.340]  All right, guys, it's obviously time to end this podcast.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.900]  I wanna thank everybody for listening to an hour
[01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.060]  and 15 minute episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:16:14.060 --> 01:16:16.580]  I wanna thank Mike once again for joining me.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:18.780]  I think that's all I am responsible for
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:20.340]  on this episode for saying thank you to.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:22.100]  I wanna thank everybody that has sent me emails.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.900]  I wanna thank Arachnid Death for serving.
[01:16:23.900 --> 01:16:26.380]  I wanna thank Arachnid Death for the excellent email.
[01:16:26.380 --> 01:16:27.900]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend,
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.740]  the Dab and Granny.
[01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:29.560]  What's up, Granny?
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.400]  I miss you.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:31.220]  I love you every day.
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.220]  We have to get together to take Dabs soon.
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:33.180]  Granny and I have been talking
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:35.260]  about going somewhere together.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.500]  We may record a podcast there.
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:38.460]  I don't wanna talk too much about it
[01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:40.460]  because I just wanna let it happen.
[01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:41.660]  So look forward to that.
[01:16:42.660 --> 01:16:44.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, until next time,
[01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.700]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
