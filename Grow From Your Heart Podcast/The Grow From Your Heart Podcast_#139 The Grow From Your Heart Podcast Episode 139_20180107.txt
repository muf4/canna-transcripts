[00:12.600 --> 00:22.970]  Welcome back, cannabis community. It's time for episode number 139 of the Grow From Your
[00:22.970 --> 00:28.130]  Heart podcast, your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right,
[00:28.130 --> 00:31.810]  if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:31.810 --> 00:35.770]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:35.770 --> 00:41.050]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you. I'm your host, my friends
[00:41.050 --> 00:44.770]  call me Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you once again for joining me. As always, I need to
[00:44.770 --> 00:48.210]  send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use
[00:48.210 --> 00:55.250]  their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat, Coot, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.250 --> 00:58.250]  You guys sitting across the table from me is our good buddy, White Mike. How you doing,
[00:58.250 --> 01:02.050]  bro? I'm doing good, man. How are you? I'm doing great. I listened to a podcast I recorded
[01:02.050 --> 01:05.730]  a couple of days ago and you know what I say way too fucking much? What? Good buddy. Good
[01:05.730 --> 01:13.610]  buddy. Good buddy. Yeah. My good friend. I say good. I describe my level of friendliness
[01:13.610 --> 01:18.050]  with somebody as good. My good buddy. That means you've been elevated past just my buddy.
[01:18.050 --> 01:21.330]  Promoted. Yeah. A little promotion that it's like a gold star next to your name. One of
[01:21.330 --> 01:24.770]  the fun things in the intro that I always look for is the order in which the guests
[01:24.770 --> 01:29.530]  are introduced clockwise, counterclockwise. I try to do ladies first, but I smoke a lot
[01:29.530 --> 01:34.930]  of dabs and sometimes I forget a normal, what are those casualties, pleasantries, courtesies,
[01:34.930 --> 01:39.130]  common courtesies. I forget some of that shit sometimes. I just get high and I try. I try
[01:39.130 --> 01:43.590]  to do, sometimes there's a method to my madness. Sometimes it just falls in place because I'm
[01:43.590 --> 01:49.070]  high and that's how it went. I'm going to try to quit saying good buddy. My good buddy.
[01:49.070 --> 01:53.510]  That just sounds weird. It's a, you broke yourself with some of the cussing, so I bet
[01:53.510 --> 01:58.590]  you can do it. I've tried. I had to. Yeah. I want it to be a listenable podcast every
[01:58.590 --> 02:01.550]  now and then when I'm listening to a show, I think, Oh, you know, I should stop doing
[02:01.550 --> 02:04.990]  that or I should slow down. And then we get here and start recording and just the, all
[02:04.990 --> 02:09.750]  of that melts away. We just do a hell of a show. Somebody that I, uh, I truly respect
[02:09.750 --> 02:13.990]  in the podcasting industry. Listen to my podcast. Then he's like, I gotta say, I like
[02:13.990 --> 02:19.110]  your show, but you're sure you sure do drop a lot of F bombs. And I was like, Oh yeah,
[02:19.110 --> 02:25.710]  you're right, sir. I really, this is a weed cast. If you've got the kids in the car, you
[02:25.710 --> 02:30.950]  know, it's just, yeah. I say, uh, if you're just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[02:30.950 --> 02:34.410]  that could be anybody that could be, uh, some people that are, they're all at church learning
[02:34.410 --> 02:37.990]  about cannabis through Ross to Jeff and the girl from your heart podcast. It could be
[02:37.990 --> 02:40.390]  welcome everybody. I'm going to turn down the music. We're going to get into the show
[02:40.390 --> 02:45.230]  now. Sorry. I apologize for all of the, uh, the show intro rambling. Uh, big shot. It's
[02:45.230 --> 02:48.630]  my friends at elevate. You know how it goes. If you need new glass, go to elevate by yourself
[02:48.630 --> 02:52.710]  and you read, get a new dab or get a new carb cat by yourself and email, go say hi to the
[02:52.710 --> 02:57.350]  beautiful and lovely ladies. And one gentleman over at elevate glass in Colorado Springs,
[02:57.350 --> 03:01.630]  five 17 South day home, go park on Moreno. I think that's the name of the street. It's
[03:01.630 --> 03:05.310]  free. You don't have to park right there on Tayhoan and spend money. Go park on Moreno.
[03:05.310 --> 03:08.670]  A lot more spaces. You don't have to park in front of the restaurants and shit. Save
[03:08.670 --> 03:13.990]  yourself some time. Get yourself some nice glass. Great glass. I was just sorry. Almost
[03:13.990 --> 03:17.790]  not room for the microphones tonight because Jeff's been shopping. Oh, and I need to clean.
[03:17.790 --> 03:22.150]  This one is why this one's out. And then I wanted to put the email on that one is why
[03:22.150 --> 03:26.910]  that one is out. And then I like this banger on this one and this court's nail on this
[03:26.910 --> 03:31.990]  hit man. Rig is pretty nice. Stoner dishes. I really liked the action that I get off of
[03:31.990 --> 03:37.350]  this elevate recycler. The action is just fresh. It just, it perks at percolates. You
[03:37.350 --> 03:41.270]  get a big fat rip off of it. Anyway, shout out to my friends at elevate glass. Go check
[03:41.270 --> 03:44.870]  them out. Tell them Ross to Jeff sent you. Give them a high five. Give them a hug. They're
[03:44.870 --> 03:49.430]  great over there. Also a big shout out to my friend citizen J at Tok radio.com. You
[03:49.430 --> 03:54.990]  can now hear this podcast on Tok radio.com Wednesdays at 1 PM. Also make sure you listen
[03:54.990 --> 03:57.750]  to all the other shows on Tok radio. You guys check them out. There's a show that you will
[03:57.750 --> 04:04.310]  enjoy. Do we big high five to my friend Lucy and her show, Lucy and this guy. How you been
[04:04.310 --> 04:09.950]  Mike? I'm good, man. Really busy. What's the most interesting thing you have smoked since
[04:09.950 --> 04:14.510]  I've seen you last. That sounds crazy. Cannabis related. What's the most interesting cannabis
[04:14.510 --> 04:18.710]  product? Not just smoked consumed the most. I'm going to, sorry. I asked a really crazy
[04:18.710 --> 04:22.150]  question now that I think about it. It wasn't, but did you smoke some DMT? No. What I really
[04:22.150 --> 04:25.770]  mean is what is the, uh, the most interesting cannabis product you've consumed? Anything
[04:25.770 --> 04:28.610]  that you can get your attention cannabis wise since last time I saw you. Um, there's
[04:28.610 --> 04:35.330]  some solventless ice wax floating around that, uh, is pretty delicious. Um, we got to sample
[04:35.330 --> 04:39.350]  a little of it tonight, but I also got to sample of it. Uh, somebody else got to show
[04:39.350 --> 04:44.010]  that off before you, um, yeah. Shout out to my friend that got to show that off today.
[04:44.010 --> 04:47.850]  Shout out to Lindsay. She should be here for the podcast. I didn't invite her. We're just
[04:47.850 --> 04:51.450]  going to do a little, little boy show tonight. Nothing against you, Lindsay. Sometimes I
[04:51.450 --> 04:54.850]  just got to have Mike over and do this. Sometimes I'll have just Lindsay over. We'll do this.
[04:54.850 --> 05:01.330]  I'll be here by myself. It's a podcast. It's my podcast and I do what I want to do. My
[05:01.330 --> 05:09.290]  favorite aside in a while just happened. Um, but before the ice wax, it was probably, um,
[05:09.290 --> 05:16.810]  this 60% CBD shatter as well. It's it's labeled as shatter. It's at best of pulling snap.
[05:16.810 --> 05:21.450]  It's a little hot lately. It's been, um, yeah, it's been a hundred degrees. Everybody shatters
[05:21.450 --> 05:28.290]  snap and peel right now. Um, but, uh, yeah, really, really tasty. So Mike's talking about
[05:28.290 --> 05:34.930]  some ice wax. Uh, what he's talking about is some cream. Uh, this is 120 micron ice
[05:34.930 --> 05:40.770]  wax made from fresh frozen flowers. Uh, this hash is like say, uh, too much. So I got to
[05:40.770 --> 05:44.170]  quit saying good buddy. And, uh, that's something we got to fix. I'll make a mental note. We'll
[05:44.170 --> 05:48.370]  try to quit doing that. Sorry guys. I apologize if I've been doing that to you too much. Uh,
[05:48.370 --> 05:52.730]  but, uh, this has been hit with fresh frozen material. They take the fresh frozen material
[05:52.730 --> 05:56.730]  and I don't know the exact process, but when it comes back, uh, it's delivered to us in
[05:56.730 --> 06:01.290]  a cooler and we keep it in a cooler and it looks like beach sand. And if you just take
[06:01.290 --> 06:04.570]  a little of the beach sand and throw it in a, like heat up the banger and throw it in
[06:04.570 --> 06:07.930]  the banger, you'll get a really good debt. But I like to take some and fold it into some
[06:07.930 --> 06:10.770]  parchment paper. And I heat up my carb cap just a little bit. I hit it with the torch
[06:10.770 --> 06:14.330]  just for a second and then roll it over it a couple of times and mash it into like a
[06:14.330 --> 06:18.650]  little Patty and make it look like a sheet of shatter or some pressed Rosin. Then I take
[06:18.650 --> 06:22.170]  dabs of it like that and it burns a little better. It burns a little more evenly. Uh,
[06:22.170 --> 06:29.170]  man, it gets me really, really bad. Uh, as you can tell from this intro, we're both really
[06:29.690 --> 06:36.690]  baked. Yeah. All I've, uh, I don't think I've smoked any VHO today. I think all of the smoking
[06:36.930 --> 06:41.810]  I've done has been ice wax. As the lady said, your eyes are red as the devil's Dick son.
[06:42.010 --> 06:48.490]  What lady said that? Uh, the angry lady cop and a pineapple express. Oh, okay. That makes
[06:48.490 --> 06:52.050]  more sense. Okay. That's why I don't remember being there for that. It was like that didn't
[06:52.050 --> 06:56.610]  happen to me. Nope. Happened on film. Much better. All right. Listen, let's look at it.
[06:56.610 --> 07:03.250]  Uh, let's put this podcast of a train wreck onto some, uh, they do like it when we ramble.
[07:03.250 --> 07:08.650]  Speaking of people that like it, when we ramble, what upset also, uh, what up my friend down
[07:08.650 --> 07:12.890]  under. Thanks for all, everything you do, Sab. I appreciate it. Um, congratulations
[07:12.890 --> 07:16.490]  buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Well that is public knowledge. How you put it up on Facebook. Congrats on
[07:16.490 --> 07:19.490]  the little one, bro. Dude's in Australia. We learned about it on Facebook. We can say
[07:19.490 --> 07:22.810]  congratulations on the podcast. Yeah. Congrats brother. Congrats. Uh, what are you going
[07:22.810 --> 07:27.410]  to name the kid? That's what I want to know. Next. Uh, what are some, Oh man, don't put,
[07:27.410 --> 07:31.770]  don't put that, start that pressure yet. People tweet us really cool cannabis related baby
[07:31.770 --> 07:39.130]  names. Tweet them to me at GFYH podcast. Yeah. At GFYH podcast on Twitter. I want to
[07:39.130 --> 07:46.290]  know what you think are really cool cannabis related baby names. Mary Jane is fucking obvious.
[07:46.290 --> 07:51.410]  I was going to say, if you tweet Mary Jane or Sativa or Indica, you're just out. Ruta
[07:51.410 --> 07:55.130]  Rallis would be a dick name right there. Well, I don't know. Cause imagine Mary Jane and
[07:55.130 --> 08:01.930]  a little Australian accent. Why'd you have to go right there? Sorry, Seb. It'll sound
[08:01.930 --> 08:05.850]  really cool. I'm not going to be offensive and try to do a shitty Australian accent cause
[08:05.850 --> 08:09.890]  I know it's not going to be good, but it'll, it'll sound really funny. And I know, I know
[08:09.890 --> 08:14.930]  Seb's last name, so it would really flow. It would work. Uh, but you guys tweet me your,
[08:14.930 --> 08:20.770]  your ideas. Let's, but anyway, uh, shout out to our friend Fred Garvin. Fred, uh, loved
[08:20.770 --> 08:24.730]  the podcast. Oh, I got the wrong email on the screen. Here we go. Fred loved the podcast
[08:24.730 --> 08:29.850]  that we put out recently, uh, about breeding seeds and how to take care of his seed harvest.
[08:29.850 --> 08:34.210]  He said, there's something that we left out. Let me just read what Fred sent me instead
[08:34.210 --> 08:37.510]  of stumbling through this. He said, question about the last show. You guys mentioned moving
[08:37.510 --> 08:42.330]  seated females outside and point some point in a run. I'd like to do that. Just wondering
[08:42.330 --> 08:48.290]  the right way to do this. I run my lights at 6 PM to 6 AM. So what is the best transition
[08:48.290 --> 08:56.590]  time at 6 PM? Let's see at 6 PM when it usually light on or okay. Or 6 AM when the lights
[08:56.590 --> 09:00.850]  are off. Also here in SoCal, we have about 14 and a half hours of light right now. So
[09:00.850 --> 09:04.770]  if I do this, should I cut them off at 12 hours with some light depth or to leave them
[09:04.770 --> 09:10.710]  be all my outdoor plants are well into flower. All right. So he's got some, he's got a process
[09:10.710 --> 09:16.190]  on his hands. Yeah. He's got some seated females. He's got some plants that he, it sounds like
[09:16.190 --> 09:19.790]  he's got some plants that were hit with pollen and they're seated and he wants to take them
[09:19.790 --> 09:26.110]  outside to finish up, but he's been running his lights from 6 PM to 6 AM. So basically
[09:26.110 --> 09:31.010]  when the sun's going down, his lights are coming on. Yep. Um, and he wants to put these
[09:31.010 --> 09:37.450]  plants outside your goal. I, he's going to have to baby step his way around the clock
[09:37.450 --> 09:43.290]  and they, and introduce them into the sun slowly. Maybe also, I don't know how big they
[09:43.290 --> 09:47.570]  are and how hardy they are, but I don't know if putting these plants out into the sunshine,
[09:47.570 --> 09:53.210]  how you're, how slow you're slowly, you need to introduce them. So, um, shoot, you got
[09:53.210 --> 09:59.930]  a challenge there. I would almost start adjusting your indoor cycle to match the outdoor cycle.
[09:59.930 --> 10:05.130]  Yeah. You don't want to, you can't jump it. Can you, you can't do like six hours a day.
[10:05.130 --> 10:09.050]  You've got to do like half hour on either end. Right. I would almost, and this may sound
[10:09.050 --> 10:13.970]  crazy. I would almost leave the lights off, just unplug them and tell, and then reset
[10:13.970 --> 10:18.730]  the schedule. Uh, leave them off for a good 24 to 36 hours. However you have to do that.
[10:18.730 --> 10:23.170]  Just handle it like a power outage, huh? Yeah. Yeah. But let it go for a long time because
[10:23.170 --> 10:29.650]  you would rather interrupt a light period than a dark period. Like clouds happen. Sun
[10:29.650 --> 10:35.850]  at night doesn't. Well, just naturally those clouds don't block out the sun for the plants
[10:35.850 --> 10:43.970]  to sleep. But you don't want, yeah, you're not going to be able to get, yeah, I think
[10:43.970 --> 10:48.050]  your best bet is just to start adjusting your timer to the outside schedule. I would leave
[10:48.050 --> 10:52.690]  it off for like 36 hours. Just unplug it, leave it off for 24 to 36 hours so that those
[10:52.690 --> 10:57.970]  plants get that solid 12 hours. And then whenever that next time, like if you're, let's see,
[10:57.970 --> 11:03.330]  you're turning off at 6am. So what kind of stress is that going to do the plants though?
[11:03.330 --> 11:06.290]  They've been around when the power has gone out here for a while or I've had, remember
[11:06.290 --> 11:10.050]  a long time ago I had an issue in a grow room and I couldn't get enough power and everything.
[11:10.050 --> 11:13.610]  It just fucked up and I couldn't get the electrician here for several days. I was at the old house.
[11:13.610 --> 11:17.450]  It was at the old house actually. Yeah. And we couldn't get an electrician around. So,
[11:17.450 --> 11:22.090]  uh, they just stayed off for like 36 hours until the electrician could come on. I think
[11:22.090 --> 11:25.970]  it's better to put them in the dark and just let them sleep. They're not going to get the
[11:25.970 --> 11:30.730]  sunshine or the light for that day's growth, but they're still going to keep developing.
[11:30.730 --> 11:34.570]  He's got him seated, so he's got to hurry up and do this within like a 24 to 36 hour
[11:34.570 --> 11:39.530]  period. He's only going to miss one day of that photo period. He'll be all right. Well,
[11:39.530 --> 11:45.170]  he'll make that, that photo period of being outside the provider doesn't kill. Yeah. Yeah.
[11:45.170 --> 11:49.330]  That sun energy is definitely going to make up for that. That'll, that is a very good
[11:49.330 --> 11:55.850]  point. So, okay. So the plan so far is to kill the lights for 24 to 36 hours, move the
[11:55.970 --> 12:00.570]  indoor girls onto a light cycle that's in line with the outdoor light cycle that he's
[12:00.570 --> 12:06.170]  currently dealing with. And then he's going to run them in and out every day. Or is they
[12:06.170 --> 12:10.770]  just going to go outside full time? Did I just overcomplicate? No, no, you're right
[12:10.770 --> 12:15.250]  where you need to be. Yeah. Flip the unplug them. Uh, let them rest in the dark until
[12:15.250 --> 12:19.350]  you can get the timer to come back on when the sun comes up. Uh, so you're pretty much
[12:19.350 --> 12:23.750]  going to have to, you're going to need 36 hours from your time schedule. It sounds like,
[12:23.750 --> 12:28.350]  so unplug them, wait until the sun until you can match the time of the sun, let them
[12:28.350 --> 12:32.430]  get their solid 12 hours of sleep, then match the time of the sun, plug your timer into
[12:32.430 --> 12:37.630]  that. And then maybe every day, take them out for four or five hours and pay really
[12:37.630 --> 12:40.830]  good attention to them and just take them out and pay attention. Maybe if you see them
[12:40.830 --> 12:44.510]  getting fucked up, take them in the house and then do them for a little longer next
[12:44.510 --> 12:48.190]  time, a little longer. But maybe if they're big and healthy enough, it's Fred. I know
[12:48.190 --> 12:51.190]  Fred, Fred, your plants are healthy, bro. You could probably take them out there and
[12:51.190 --> 12:54.670]  put them out there and they'll be cool. But keep an eye on them. Keep a good eye on them.
[12:54.670 --> 12:59.110]  Be out there with them. They call it acclimating and it really does work best in stages. Yeah.
[12:59.110 --> 13:03.750]  Give them two hours for two days and then three hours for two days. That kind of thing.
[13:03.750 --> 13:08.310]  Right. Then his next question, uh, next part of his question, he says that out there in
[13:08.310 --> 13:12.070]  SoCal they have about 14 and a half hours of light right now. So if he does that, should
[13:12.070 --> 13:17.230]  he cut them off at 12 hours with some light depth or let them be, if you can cut them
[13:17.230 --> 13:23.750]  off with light depth, that would be awesome. If not, here's a, in Ed Rosenthal's book,
[13:23.750 --> 13:27.070]  the Oakster Damn course guide. I don't remember the exact title of the book, but there is
[13:27.070 --> 13:35.150]  a section about near and far red lighting and the, I'm, I would have to read it to be
[13:35.150 --> 13:40.390]  completely accurate. But one of those spectrums happens when the sun sets and rises. It happens
[13:40.390 --> 13:47.070]  when the sun sets and that red it's either near or far red tells the plant to go to sleep.
[13:47.190 --> 13:52.470]  That triggers it to go to sleep. So I think your 14 hours, you may be getting enough sleep
[13:52.470 --> 13:58.710]  time. Uh, I'm not sure your plants are waking up and going to bed, uh, for there. I think
[13:58.710 --> 14:01.150]  you're going to get, I think it's going to work out is what I think I'm trying to say.
[14:01.150 --> 14:05.830]  I think you'll be all right. If you can cover it, do it. Uh, if, if it's possible, by all
[14:05.830 --> 14:09.550]  means just do it, make the extra effort and go for it. And then you're certain that it's
[14:09.550 --> 14:14.150]  going to work. And if you can't build the outdoor hoop house or whatever you're going
[14:14.150 --> 14:18.430]  to use to cover them, light depth area, uh, maybe wait just a couple of weeks and you'll
[14:18.430 --> 14:22.830]  be just fine. Well, you'll be well into your outdoor photo period. Just a few weeks.
[14:22.830 --> 14:27.430]  We're already at that point in this Jesus man time flies when you're having a kid time
[14:27.430 --> 14:33.870]  goes. Yeah. Welcome to the club brother. Um, yesterday my daughter turned 13. I'm sitting
[14:33.870 --> 14:37.470]  here thinking like, nah, he just put the people just put their plan. Now that happened weeks
[14:38.470 --> 14:44.110]  and weeks ago. Yeah. Plants have been outside weeks and weeks ago. Yep. Um, yeah. Um, so
[14:44.110 --> 14:48.510]  my daughter turned 13 yesterday and spent her birthday at a play in London. Congrats.
[14:48.510 --> 14:52.510]  Yes, yes. Well, thank you. Thank you. Happy birthday kiddo. She does not listen to the
[14:52.510 --> 14:57.550]  show, but all right. So Fred, I hope we didn't give you just a whole bunch of crap cause
[14:57.550 --> 15:01.270]  we're both high and we rambled a lot, but hashtag they like it when we ramble. Yep.
[15:01.270 --> 15:05.390]  Um, cut the time. Kind of kind of answered his question. The Fred's main problem that
[15:05.390 --> 15:10.030]  I foresee is going to be, there's a reason he's running at night. Um, and if he's lucky,
[15:10.030 --> 15:14.910]  it's just economics. They go off at 6am. So leave them off. They would normally come back
[15:14.910 --> 15:19.950]  on at 6pm. Don't turn them on then leave them off until the sun comes back up around six
[15:19.950 --> 15:23.710]  dude. That's what you got to do. Figure out when the sun comes up that day. So they're
[15:23.710 --> 15:32.060]  only going to be off for 24 hours cause he's turning them off at 6am. Okay. You know what
[15:32.060 --> 15:36.140]  I'm saying? Fred, they've got to go at least 36. What I was getting at is like people run
[15:36.860 --> 15:42.300]  math for temperature reasons. It's a lot easier to cool your system. You're right. Yeah. At night
[15:42.300 --> 15:47.500]  it's a, and uh, sometimes in some places power's cheaper and some people have day jobs and have to
[15:47.500 --> 15:54.620]  grow wheat at night, right? But depending on what Fred's reasons are for going at night, he, uh,
[15:55.580 --> 16:01.740]  um, is definitely going to have some work to, to figure out some adjusting about a 36 hour window
[16:01.740 --> 16:06.140]  there to figure it out. So cut the timer, uh, get them on the same schedule as the outside.
[16:06.140 --> 16:11.420]  If you can, I, that's the best I can tell you for that part. Uh, then start taking them outside
[16:11.420 --> 16:15.900]  slowly or cut them off for 36 hours and then take them outside if that's what you have to do.
[16:17.260 --> 16:20.780]  And then if you need to put them in the hoop house to get them dark, do that. And if not,
[16:20.780 --> 16:27.900]  I think you'll be okay, but I could be wrong to be totally honest. But I think, uh, about 13,
[16:27.900 --> 16:33.420]  14 hours, uh, you should be getting enough nighttime photo period for those plants,
[16:34.380 --> 16:40.140]  but be careful. All right. There's a lot of fucking things. There's so many variables in
[16:40.140 --> 16:43.980]  there. Yes. Fred, I hope we answered your question. I hope we helped you out. I hope,
[16:44.540 --> 16:48.380]  uh, I get a couple of packs of those seeds when you get finished with this project.
[16:49.260 --> 16:52.140]  Dude, thanks for, uh, Fred, thanks for the support. Thanks for listening so much. You've
[16:52.140 --> 16:55.580]  been following me for a long time on social media. You've been listening to the show since
[16:56.140 --> 17:00.380]  I think you got a prize on episode 50. That's how long ago that was. And now that I'm thinking
[17:00.380 --> 17:05.180]  about it was at 50 when we gave away a whole bunch of stuff, I can't remember. I think it was 50.
[17:05.180 --> 17:10.700]  Yeah. It was number one hundred. We had everybody here and we just got that. It was 50. Yeah. So
[17:10.700 --> 17:14.460]  it was 50. And I think Fred got a prize in that. So that's how long Fred's been supporting us.
[17:14.460 --> 17:18.620]  Thanks a lot, brother. I appreciate that. Thanks for interacting. Um, if you have a follow-up
[17:18.620 --> 17:23.100]  question to our rambles, please send it to me the same way that you sent this one and I'll check it
[17:23.100 --> 17:29.660]  out. Yep. All right. I'm going to move on to the next part of the show. We got an email from a
[17:29.660 --> 17:35.500]  friend who, um, he has a problem. Let me just read the email. He says, Hey, Ross, I love the show.
[17:35.500 --> 17:40.140]  Maybe you can help me recover from a huge mistake. I think I may have mislabeled two different plants
[17:40.140 --> 17:46.300]  when I was cloning them. Now I think five are Alaskan Thunderfuck and five are Master Kush.
[17:46.300 --> 17:51.740]  How should I go about making sure I clone and properly label said plants? Then he says,
[17:51.740 --> 17:57.100]  should I take a clone of each plant and label them mom and clone with a certain tag and do all 10
[17:57.660 --> 18:03.260]  or should I make more than one clone of each? I know after I clone, I need to toss the moms into
[18:03.260 --> 18:10.220]  bloom after I see roots. So it sounds like this dude, uh, had a mother plant and took clones,
[18:10.220 --> 18:16.460]  took 10 clones and may have mislabeled those 10 clones. He's hoping he took five and five
[18:16.540 --> 18:23.500]  and lost all 10 labels is what basically what I'm getting. Right. I'm hoping he at least had the,
[18:23.500 --> 18:28.780]  uh, the mother plants out properly and took five and five. I'm hoping that that went right. Yeah.
[18:28.780 --> 18:32.860]  That's the, that's, I didn't even think about that part when I read the question. The real,
[18:32.860 --> 18:39.660]  the real answer to this is, is proper labeling from the get go and how each grower goes about.
[18:39.660 --> 18:44.380]  That is wildly different. Right? Well, I'll give him my advice and, uh, props for admitting that
[18:44.380 --> 18:48.060]  you may have made a mistake, but in your pothead mind, you probably did it just fine. And you're
[18:48.060 --> 18:53.900]  paranoid, but let's, uh, he asks, first of all, now I think a five or this and five or this,
[18:53.900 --> 18:59.180]  how should I go about making sure I clone and properly label said plants? Okay. Take all 10
[18:59.180 --> 19:04.780]  of those plants and set them in a straight line of a row and then grab one plant. The one that's in
[19:04.780 --> 19:12.700]  the front of the row and take that to an area and get some white duct tape and write a on that one,
[19:12.700 --> 19:16.380]  and then cut as many clones as you can cut from it without killing that plant
[19:17.020 --> 19:21.900]  and label all of those clones very clearly. However you, if you cut them into a rapid
[19:21.900 --> 19:26.780]  routers, if you cut them into an easy cloner, label them a, and then take that plant that's
[19:26.780 --> 19:32.060]  labeled a and put it somewhere else. Now go get the next plant. That's in that straight line filled
[19:32.060 --> 19:36.860]  with plants and carry it over to the cloning area. Get that white duct tape, write a B on there and
[19:36.860 --> 19:41.900]  label that motherfucker B and then take as many clones as you can get off of plant that is now
[19:41.900 --> 19:47.740]  number B. Get as many clones as you can and label them carefully. B that's what you got to do. I
[19:47.740 --> 19:51.900]  think my friend, I think that's, what's got to happen. It's a, it's all in setting it up from
[19:51.900 --> 19:57.580]  the get go. I used to help a dude clone a hundred, 200 clones at a time from six, eight, 10 different
[19:57.580 --> 20:03.260]  strains and um, everything got labeled when they're in that obnoxious little pup 10 cloner.
[20:04.060 --> 20:11.660]  We'd cut little slivers out of a solo cup, um, and use those as little label pegs to go in next
[20:11.660 --> 20:18.220]  to the plug. Yeah. Um, other people use really good little labels, those little just plant label
[20:18.220 --> 20:22.380]  sticks. I just use those and write on those and stick them in the neoprene is how I do it. I've
[20:22.380 --> 20:26.700]  seen ones that look like a, it almost looks like a little flag that you would stick in like a
[20:26.700 --> 20:31.740]  sandwich or something like a toothpick that stick right in the plugs that make it real easy. How
[20:31.740 --> 20:38.940]  cute. Um, but like keeping your labels good from the get goes the best way here. Um, as long as
[20:38.940 --> 20:45.420]  you make sure you've got, um, uh, a healthy clone from your mother, when you flower that out, like
[20:45.420 --> 20:49.420]  you'll be able to tell, Oh, this one's more cushy. This one's right. Yeah. Hopefully within like
[20:49.420 --> 20:54.380]  four or five to six weeks, you'll know which is, and as long as you go ahead and get your labels
[20:54.380 --> 21:02.780]  right, when you clone next, um, you'll know for sure. Okay. Um, these clones are definitely from
[21:02.780 --> 21:07.660]  plant a, these clones are definitely from plant B once you fucking fit or once you finally finish
[21:07.660 --> 21:13.580]  it out, you'll know, okay. Um, plant a was the Alaskan plan. What you can do. So once you're
[21:13.580 --> 21:16.700]  going to take cuts, right. And you're going to have hopefully three, I like to take three cuts.
[21:16.700 --> 21:21.980]  I've got OCD that works in groups of threes. So I take a, take three cuts and then take mother plant
[21:21.980 --> 21:25.980]  a mother plant, be lined them back up in the grow room. All pretty let your clones root. As soon as
[21:25.980 --> 21:30.220]  you see roots on there, uh, put them into their next stage, which is usually a cup for me. Some
[21:30.220 --> 21:34.060]  people use a little one gallon pot, whatever you want to do, put it in the next step and then take
[21:34.060 --> 21:38.540]  that one that you cut the clone from. It's already grown. It's already big. Uh, just go flower that
[21:38.540 --> 21:43.340]  one. I think that's what the plan called for. Uh, I think he just wants to make sure he gets his
[21:43.340 --> 21:48.780]  genetics, uh, toss the moms into bloom after I see roots. So yeah, yep. There you go. Exactly,
[21:48.780 --> 21:53.100]  bro. So I think you figured out what you got to do. You have to take clones from every one of them.
[21:53.100 --> 21:56.940]  And then the best part is now you're going to have a bunch of clones to grow next time.
[21:56.940 --> 22:02.060]  Right. Um, if you're, if, if you're not sure at this point, what you're, what you're about to
[22:02.060 --> 22:09.180]  flower out is, and you're not a hundred percent sure you've got its genetics, um, preserved in a
[22:09.180 --> 22:13.100]  healthy clone, just go ahead and take another clone and then give it, I mean, you only have to
[22:13.100 --> 22:18.380]  give it a few days. If you only take three clones, four clones off of it, unless your mother plant is
[22:18.380 --> 22:23.420]  really like, I don't know if he's still got a mother plant, like the original mom that these
[22:23.420 --> 22:27.260]  five of each clones came from. I don't know where that is in this story. So I'm just assuming he
[22:27.260 --> 22:31.740]  doesn't have that. I'm assuming all he's got are these 10 clones and he's got to figure out what
[22:31.740 --> 22:36.860]  easily be that way. Hopefully, hopefully there's five and five. I watched you clone a nugget. You
[22:36.860 --> 22:43.340]  were handed once. Don't tell people all the crazy shit I've done. Like if you've still got the plant alive, you can,
[22:43.340 --> 22:48.780]  you can preserve the genetics if you must. We were at a garden and somebody was trying to be nice and
[22:48.780 --> 22:53.100]  blessed me by cutting off a fresh little tiny bottom bud. And they're like, try that out and
[22:53.100 --> 22:56.060]  check it out. Cause I wasn't going to see the guy for a while. And I wasn't going to get a chance
[22:56.060 --> 23:00.700]  to taste the medicine when it finished. And he gave me, it still had leaves on it. It still was
[23:00.700 --> 23:05.660]  beautiful. It was fresh off the bud and we're driving. And Mike said, you know what you should do is you
[23:05.660 --> 23:11.740]  should try to clone that because it was a plant that we really wished we had. Yep. And it worked.
[23:11.740 --> 23:16.300]  It worked. I cloned it and it took a long time to revert that bud back into a usable plant, but I
[23:16.300 --> 23:21.260]  was able to clone that plant. We had that strain around for, and it was kind of a fucking mutant of
[23:21.260 --> 23:27.260]  it, but it, the bud was very similar. The flavor, but it still looked the same. You know? Yeah. But so I
[23:27.260 --> 23:31.820]  did clone a flowered bud. It took a long time to revert it. The leaves did a bunch of spirally,
[23:31.820 --> 23:35.500]  weird, twisty shit, but yeah, I've done some crazy things. So dude, what you got to do,
[23:36.060 --> 23:39.580]  I'm going to recap and then we're going to move on. Take clones from all of them. As many clones
[23:39.580 --> 23:43.900]  as you can afford to take space wise and without murdering that plant. Then while you're taking
[23:43.900 --> 23:47.420]  those clones, carefully shape that plant into something that would flower nicely. Then carry
[23:47.420 --> 23:52.380]  those to the flower room when you see roots and flower the shit out of them. That's my advice.
[23:52.380 --> 23:56.620]  All right. Dude, thank you for the question. I hope I helped you out next time label more carefully,
[23:56.620 --> 24:00.940]  but don't be afraid to admit that you make some mistakes. Please continue to send me emails. Keep
[24:00.940 --> 24:05.580]  me updated on this, how this goes. I think you hit me up on Instagram. It looks like thanks for
[24:05.580 --> 24:10.780]  following me on there. Guys, if you want to follow me on Instagram, it's Iree underscore genetics.
[24:10.780 --> 24:17.420]  I would appreciate that. All right. Now today, something cool happened in the state of Colorado.
[24:17.420 --> 24:23.180]  Something very cool. Something very cool happened. If you don't live here, if you don't, well, yeah,
[24:23.180 --> 24:26.780]  if you live here, well, I wrote, I wrote down a list of pros and I want to see if there's a list
[24:26.780 --> 24:34.140]  of cons that you can come up with once we talk about this. Sure. So today the Colorado MED
[24:34.860 --> 24:40.620]  stated that does it start today? I was told it started today. Starting today. Well then by the
[24:40.620 --> 24:43.740]  time this recording comes out, it will have already started. They didn't change this rule.
[24:43.740 --> 24:50.700]  This rule was changed in the legislature, I believe. Okay. If I'm not mistaken, the,
[24:50.700 --> 24:55.660]  the legislatures wrote it, passed it. It was signed by the governor and the MED implemented
[24:55.660 --> 25:01.580]  it today. Nice. Okay. I didn't even think this was going to pass. It's a really, really, really nice,
[25:01.580 --> 25:06.300]  nice little gift to the industry. We've just built up so much suspense that we should tell everybody
[25:06.300 --> 25:10.460]  what happened. Guess what happened? Guess what happened you guys? So it's starting today. Today
[25:10.460 --> 25:18.700]  is July, June 16th while we travel. June 16th? June 16th. 15th. June 15th. Oh, thank Christ.
[25:18.700 --> 25:21.900]  It's the 16th. No, it's the, well, it's after midnight is why I'm tripping. Cause I was going
[25:21.900 --> 25:25.980]  to say, I've got an anniversary like Minniana. I just about fucked that up.
[25:27.580 --> 25:33.260]  Happy anniversary, Jen. Hope you're listening. Um, she probably isn't. Uh, so she's sleeping.
[25:33.260 --> 25:36.940]  Starting on the, it happened on the 15th. We're now recording after midnight. Midnight has passed.
[25:36.940 --> 25:41.740]  So it started on the 15th. We're rambling today, guys. We blame that on bubble hash. Um, so as of
[25:41.740 --> 25:48.380]  today, as of today, out of state shoppers in a dispensary before today, let's rewind it before
[25:48.380 --> 25:53.260]  today, out of state shoppers were limited to seven grams of raw cannabis on their purchase.
[25:53.260 --> 25:59.420]  Yep. Now those same shoppers, folks who are over 21 and have an ID that can prove. So if they're
[25:59.420 --> 26:04.060]  from out of state, they are able to purchase one ounce of cannabis product per visit. Just like a
[26:04.060 --> 26:08.220]  statey. Just like someone that lives here. You can walk in and buy one ounce. Yeah. Fuck that
[26:08.220 --> 26:14.060]  native sticker. Now you're equals. Now we're all equals. You can come here and buy just the same
[26:14.140 --> 26:18.380]  amount of marijuana as anybody else. Yeah. And you're allowed to possess it. The only problem
[26:18.380 --> 26:22.380]  is there's still nowhere to smoke it. Yep. That's still an issue. That's the only car.
[26:22.380 --> 26:29.020]  There was another rule that was, uh, it was passed last, last November. Um, it was supposed to go in
[26:29.020 --> 26:34.060]  effect in January and they kicked it down the road till October that was going to restrict, um,
[26:35.340 --> 26:40.700]  out of state folks, uh, edible wise. And they're going to crank down those limits quite a bit,
[26:40.700 --> 26:44.460]  but I think all that just went out the window. Good. I love it when they talk shit out. You know,
[26:44.460 --> 26:49.340]  it did pass was no more, no more gummy bears, no more gummy bears, no more edibles, no more
[26:49.340 --> 26:53.420]  cannabis infused edibles shaped like gummy bears. You can't do that. It's not just gummy bears.
[26:53.420 --> 27:00.940]  It's a no more edible shaped like fruit shapes, animals, people. There's another one. I don't
[27:00.940 --> 27:06.380]  remember basically anything that like is currently on the market other than squares and triangles.
[27:06.380 --> 27:11.820]  They just don't want the kids to be encouraged by a great shape on the same day that particular,
[27:11.820 --> 27:17.420]  the edible restriction bill was signed. The governor signed another bill to put hard liquor
[27:17.420 --> 27:23.500]  in grocery stores. I saw that on the same day. You can buy whiskey and tequila at Walmart.
[27:23.500 --> 27:27.340]  It's going to be gradual. So for the next couple of years, it'll just be wine.
[27:28.460 --> 27:33.340]  Um, you mean I'll be able to buy a gun. I'll be able to buy a gun and a bottle of whiskey
[27:33.340 --> 27:38.620]  at the right superstore at the right Walmart, probably the one that Pablo West, you know,
[27:38.620 --> 27:44.220]  at the, at the, at the right Walmart, you will be able to get a gun and hard liquor and frozen
[27:44.220 --> 27:49.820]  pizza and the new X-Box America all at once while your oil is getting changed and you're getting
[27:49.820 --> 27:56.460]  your glasses and doing your banking and taking pictures of sweet mullets. Hopefully you're
[27:56.460 --> 28:00.940]  searching for mullets while you're at Walmart. If you can find somebody, all right guys, challenge,
[28:01.020 --> 28:05.580]  challenge. I want some, I want a picture of somebody in their pajamas with a mullet at a
[28:05.580 --> 28:09.740]  Walmart. I know I want it to be your photo. Don't internet me. Don't Google this shit.
[28:10.940 --> 28:16.060]  Um, an extra small, slightly dirty Irish shirt. Well, I don't have any shirts I can offer cause
[28:16.060 --> 28:21.820]  they're all at the store. I don't really sweaty old rest. I'll send you some stickers, some
[28:21.820 --> 28:25.660]  stickers. I got stickers all day long. I can't guarantee what they'll be, but there'll be cool
[28:25.660 --> 28:29.580]  fucking stickers. I'll send you all stuff in envelope with what I think will they'll look at
[28:29.580 --> 28:32.700]  me like, bro, you need to pay extra shipping when I send these stickers, I'll stuff an envelope.
[28:32.700 --> 28:39.980]  So here's the task, pajamas, mullet at Walmart, your picture. Three things. Yep. I want you to
[28:39.980 --> 28:47.260]  send it to me. Um, you can just tweet it to me, uh, at GFYH podcast, tweet it to me and then
[28:47.260 --> 28:52.380]  hashtag it mullet challenge. I'm going to write that down cause that's fucking, that's epic.
[28:53.740 --> 28:57.740]  If Fred wins this one too, I'm going to be a little ashamed of some of the other listeners.
[28:59.740 --> 29:04.540]  No, I legitimately wrote that down. Do they have Walmart's in Australia?
[29:05.180 --> 29:09.260]  Is WebKit or is Seb going to have to drive like 600 miles to, to attack this challenge?
[29:09.260 --> 29:12.860]  If you're in another country, if you're in, if you're in a place that doesn't have a Walmart.
[29:12.860 --> 29:15.100]  We will email you pictures of stickers, Seb.
[29:17.740 --> 29:21.660]  Seb, I can't mail you stickers, dude. You're in Australia and that's going to be so expensive.
[29:21.660 --> 29:25.260]  I looked and I researched how much it would cost to send him a shirt and the shipping was just more
[29:25.260 --> 29:29.580]  than what the shirts are even worth. I was like, no, dude, no, I'm not going to do it. Sorry.
[29:30.220 --> 29:34.700]  I just, uh, I looked up what it takes to send stuff to Costa Rica recently and I was like,
[29:34.700 --> 29:38.540]  dad ain't getting pictures of the kid. That could use email.
[29:39.900 --> 29:45.420]  Hell yeah. Uh, so at least you can man. United States citizens only in the continental United
[29:45.420 --> 29:51.020]  States, uh, are qualified for this. Sorry, but I tried. I'm sorry. I just, I can't be shipping
[29:51.180 --> 29:56.060]  across the world. I'm glad we were able to disappoint you now and not after you drove
[29:56.060 --> 30:04.540]  six hours to the Walmart. Yeah, sorry, mate. Uh, so yeah. A mullet challenge. You guys do it.
[30:04.540 --> 30:10.620]  Mullet. I want to see some good malls, pajamas, Walmart that I could probably drive seven minutes
[30:10.620 --> 30:14.940]  and find that. And I bet that's happening right up the street, right up the street. I'm sure.
[30:16.300 --> 30:20.220]  All right. Let's, you want to put this podcast back on some rails, Colorado rails.
[30:20.220 --> 30:24.060]  We've been all over the place since we started. I don't know what's even happening. I love you
[30:24.060 --> 30:28.780]  to listeners. Sometimes I'm mean, but you know, I love you. He's not that mean. He's just,
[30:28.780 --> 30:33.020]  man, he's an asshole. Sometimes I mean, it's okay. So now if you're coming from out of state,
[30:33.020 --> 30:36.460]  you can now purchase an ounce of cannabis. You can buy an ounce people. Welcome to the club.
[30:36.460 --> 30:41.100]  Yeah. Yeah. You can eat no more plastic chairs, little plastic table at dinner for you. Now you
[30:41.100 --> 30:44.860]  don't have to drive to four different dispensaries to have an ounce of weed or run to your car four
[30:44.860 --> 30:49.660]  times. That was getting sold to when we made them drive around the store, it legitimately caused
[30:49.660 --> 30:53.260]  traffic issues. Do you think, uh, do you think people are going to try to do that and buy
[30:53.900 --> 30:59.980]  more ounces? Do you think that's going to happen? Um, I think that you said you wanted a list of the
[30:59.980 --> 31:07.020]  benefits and the cons. And I think that's the con. Um, I think the dip shit from two States over
[31:07.020 --> 31:13.980]  that comes here, drops his monthly paycheck, drives all that home and flips it a couple of
[31:13.980 --> 31:18.940]  times a year. I think that's going to get a little, or at least as the potential to get a
[31:18.940 --> 31:24.380]  little worse. And the more of those idiots that get caught, the worse we look, the more heat on us.
[31:24.380 --> 31:29.100]  Right. We don't need any more black eyes right now. That is true. He said black eyes, by the way,
[31:29.100 --> 31:36.780]  black eyes. Yeah. Just to clear that whole host. Um, the cannabis industry is under a lot of fire
[31:36.780 --> 31:41.980]  right now, honestly. And if we can't keep our best foot forward, we're going to be, uh, past tense
[31:41.980 --> 31:47.500]  here in three or four years instead of bigger and better than ever. Very true. Very, very true
[31:47.500 --> 31:52.700]  guys. Quit shipping stuff. I can't ship you anything. Don't ask. I've seen saw three or four
[31:52.700 --> 31:57.900]  posts this week on social media of people say it just straight up. Stop fucking asking. Like,
[31:57.900 --> 32:02.780]  we're not going to mail you anything. We're not going to send you anything. Um, I'm not going to
[32:02.780 --> 32:08.700]  sleep with you for weed, like just the most obnoxious shit. Um, just knock it off. Like
[32:08.700 --> 32:13.100]  none of that exists here anymore. We got rid of all of it. Just go to the store. We like it this
[32:13.100 --> 32:17.660]  way. If the jar you like and you buy as much as you can afford, then you go home and puff. Yep.
[32:17.660 --> 32:21.740]  But every time another package gets caught in the mail or another putz from another state gets
[32:21.740 --> 32:28.060]  caught with 300 plants in his backyard going, but I thought we was legal hair. Like the whole
[32:28.060 --> 32:33.740]  industry takes a huge hit. Um, and if we take enough of those, we're done. And I really like
[32:33.740 --> 32:39.340]  my job people. I don't know if you can, you get that inflection over the radio. I love my job. Um,
[32:39.340 --> 32:44.220]  even with all the crap I have to deal with because of it, like, I don't want to go do drywall again.
[32:44.220 --> 32:48.300]  I really like this. I really like being able to grow cannabis on a large scale without having
[32:48.300 --> 32:52.380]  to watch over my shoulder all day. I'm done working with jail, broken teenagers. Like I
[32:52.380 --> 32:56.780]  work in the cannabis industry. Now I swear to God, if you fuck this up, I will be famous for
[32:56.780 --> 33:02.300]  being an ax murderer, chasing down all the idiots who ruined it. Uh, those statements are only
[33:02.300 --> 33:09.660]  supported by a white Mike, not the opinions of the podcast. It's just so obnoxious watching
[33:09.660 --> 33:13.820]  people fuck this up. Yeah. All right. Let's talk about some of the pros then. So the pros,
[33:13.820 --> 33:19.260]  this is huge for out of staters. You can buy an ounce just like a big boy, um, for shops.
[33:19.260 --> 33:23.820]  It, I mean, it makes life so much easier for me. I can stop counting to seven. It was like half my
[33:23.820 --> 33:27.900]  day is a butt tender, like one, two, three, four, five, six. Yep. We're good. One, two, three,
[33:27.900 --> 33:31.020]  four, five, six, seven, eight. Nope. Gonna have to do trend to transactions, sir. You're going
[33:31.020 --> 33:34.860]  to have to run out your car. Why? Cause that's the rule deal with it. Just seven. That's all you
[33:34.860 --> 33:39.740]  get. Um, I have ludicrous metaphors to just shut people up immediately with, Oh, that this is
[33:39.740 --> 33:44.460]  ludicrous. How do you guys just shut up? I don't want to have that conversation at nine time today.
[33:44.460 --> 33:49.740]  So I've got sentences that just shut it down, but we get, we get rid of all of that. Um, I hope they
[33:49.740 --> 33:55.260]  leave the edibles and the concentrates purchase limits alone. Um, and that those don't get,
[33:55.260 --> 33:59.660]  end up still getting cranked down in November. Um, it makes stuff so much easier on us. We're
[33:59.660 --> 34:04.460]  the only industry on the planet where you can't buy what you can pay for. Right. Like when you
[34:04.460 --> 34:09.100]  think about what purchase limits is actually mean and where they apply elsewhere in the world,
[34:09.100 --> 34:14.220]  it's just nuts. And now I think something that's helpful is now you can try more variety before
[34:14.220 --> 34:17.420]  you'd go and you'd get an eighth of that and an eighth of that. And then that's what you got to
[34:17.420 --> 34:23.260]  smoke on. Now you can get a real variety without destroying the price on you. Yeah. When you get
[34:24.220 --> 34:31.580]  seven grams instead of two eights or a quarter, you pay a lot more. Um, you miss that on all the
[34:31.580 --> 34:37.820]  price breaks. Okay. Um, so picking up four eights is a lot better economically than picking up seven
[34:37.820 --> 34:45.340]  grams, split four ways per gram. Oh yeah. Okay. Like buying miles. All right. And then you get
[34:45.340 --> 34:49.740]  more herb. That's one of the advantages. Yeah. More weed. Who doesn't want more weed store
[34:49.900 --> 34:54.140]  fewer trips. You have to go to and from the dispensary less times. You have to go stand in
[34:54.140 --> 34:57.900]  line. You have to don't have to deal with that dickhead security guard as many times. You don't
[34:57.900 --> 35:02.460]  have to pull out your ID and your card and sit there and wait and then go hit the ATM and pull
[35:02.460 --> 35:06.220]  out money as many times and then go see some person that doesn't really want to deal with you
[35:06.220 --> 35:14.220]  asking questions. It's a, no, your bud senders happy with questions or if they're not find a
[35:14.220 --> 35:18.940]  better shop. Yeah. And tip them. Um, yeah, if you're watching this good tip your bun tender,
[35:18.940 --> 35:22.140]  they worked really hard. They gave you a lot of knowledge. And then of course,
[35:22.140 --> 35:27.420]  if your legal limit is an ounce, why can't we buy an ounce? Yeah. Like duh. That seems weird. Don't
[35:27.420 --> 35:31.100]  make me go to four places to get my legal limit. Are you just trying to make me shop at four
[35:31.100 --> 35:37.500]  different places? Right. And do you think places are going to lose business because, uh, the guys
[35:37.500 --> 35:42.140]  that are going to buy the guys that there, there are obviously people that come from out of town
[35:42.140 --> 35:46.540]  or out of state to do this. They come and they just buy stuff to go to the second shop. That
[35:46.540 --> 35:52.060]  wasn't like shop a gets hit first, like their favorite shop, the shop that has the best price
[35:52.060 --> 35:58.940]  to the best selection, whatever that is. Shopping lose three quarters shop B loses at least a second
[35:58.940 --> 36:03.340]  visit. Or does he go to shop B and buy a whole nother ounce? Cause now it's that much easier.
[36:03.340 --> 36:07.340]  It really, I think the people that were doing that anyway, cause a lot of shops allowed you
[36:07.340 --> 36:12.860]  to make four visits. So they just made four visits at a made four visits to B or went to a,
[36:12.860 --> 36:19.180]  went to B, went to a, went to B, went to a, um, we would have people bitch about like how far
[36:19.180 --> 36:23.420]  apart we were from the others, uh, from time to time in the bedroom. They're like, yeah,
[36:23.900 --> 36:26.700]  I don't know. Making the drive one more time. Getting, getting a little dizzy.
[36:27.340 --> 36:32.620]  That's like, dude, quit being a douche. Don't tell us about it. Just do it.
[36:34.460 --> 36:40.060]  All right. But yeah, so we've got a little list of pros and cons. I'm really happy this rule
[36:40.140 --> 36:44.780]  passed. It makes my life simpler. Um, it has the potential to increase business a little bit,
[36:44.780 --> 36:49.740]  but not, not dramatically to the, to the people, to the better dispensaries, the, like we were
[36:49.740 --> 36:53.100]  talking about, maybe that second and third tier dispensary, you're going to lose that second
[36:53.100 --> 36:56.140]  quarter that would've gotten the soul. That's the guy had money for a half. He's probably just going
[36:56.140 --> 36:59.100]  to buy that whole half ounce at the good shop. Now, if he was going to buy an ounce, he's going
[36:59.100 --> 37:07.100]  to buy it all there. Um, the other little downside is everyone that moved here for marijuana had a
[37:07.100 --> 37:13.500]  big incentive to go get their ID changed. Um, when they went to the DMV and got their ID changed,
[37:13.500 --> 37:19.660]  they got registered to vote. We make that very easy here. Um, and that's going to slow down
[37:19.660 --> 37:25.340]  just a little bit. I think, um, that's just another little, a negative in the negative
[37:25.340 --> 37:29.660]  column piece. There's not a lot of negatives to this. It's nice. I didn't think of how that went
[37:29.660 --> 37:36.380]  as long as Texans don't torpedo it for us. Like I'm, I'm really happy about this, but yeah, I've
[37:36.380 --> 37:40.060]  pretty much everyone I talked to that moved here for marijuana is like, yep, get my ID switched.
[37:40.060 --> 37:44.140]  Yep. Got registered. That's pretty smart. That's going to vote for you in November. Like that's
[37:44.140 --> 37:46.940]  pretty helpful. Yeah. I didn't even think of that. Cause I've been a resident for so long
[37:46.940 --> 37:51.340]  that I never thought about how to switch my ID and you're not dealing with the crowd at the door.
[37:51.340 --> 37:57.340]  Like I am. Um, the people I talked to were, are inquiring about how to go medical. Um, you work
[37:57.340 --> 38:01.900]  for a medical dispensary, right? We got in the grow even. So you're not even handling patients.
[38:01.980 --> 38:07.020]  Yeah. I go there occasionally. I drop off product and I go purchase my own products, but I spent
[38:07.020 --> 38:11.900]  very little time there, but I see, yeah, I see patients come and go. And yeah, I see the first
[38:11.900 --> 38:16.860]  wave when they get here. Basically. I think they just enacted a new rule. It starts either the
[38:16.860 --> 38:21.900]  first, uh, it starts on the 1st of July. I think that if you are trying to use your extended plant
[38:21.900 --> 38:26.540]  count at a medical facility, you have to be a member of that facility. Now, is that an official
[38:26.540 --> 38:30.780]  rule? I knew that was the policy that a lot of shops had. Yeah. They've made an official rule
[38:30.860 --> 38:35.580]  is what I think I saw on the door at one of the stores. And they're really looking to crack down
[38:35.580 --> 38:42.300]  on some, some of the, um, abuses that can take place in the medical market. They're going
[38:42.300 --> 38:48.460]  overboard in my opinion, but like they've had it, they've caught enough really shady shit that like
[38:48.460 --> 38:52.540]  I'm not surprised the regulators are pissed and cracking down Colorado people with the medical
[38:52.540 --> 38:57.260]  card. Um, if that shit's getting close to expiring, go renew it because it's taking a long
[38:57.260 --> 39:02.300]  time for my renewal to come in. Yep. Yeah. And here's what sucks. You can't shop if you don't
[39:02.300 --> 39:08.140]  have your actual card. If your old card, you can only go get your new card 30 days before your old
[39:08.140 --> 39:15.100]  card expires. You can't renew within 30 days of the old one expiring, but it takes about 45 days
[39:15.100 --> 39:20.220]  for your new card to come in the mail. And you're not allowed to shop in a dispensary until you have
[39:20.220 --> 39:24.860]  that new permanent card in the mail. Yep. So there's going to be about it right now. It's been
[39:24.860 --> 39:29.180]  a couple of week gap before I've been able to shop. Depending on how you plan for it, it can be
[39:29.180 --> 39:33.980]  a nasty gap. And I see those people too. I've got a regular doctor that I go to for my MMJ
[39:33.980 --> 39:37.500]  recommendation and I've got a schedule and appointment and he's been so busy. It took me,
[39:37.500 --> 39:41.180]  uh, several days to get in there. I couldn't get in as quickly as I wanted to. I think it was about
[39:41.180 --> 39:46.220]  two weeks. So that put me two more weeks behind and then, yeah, so that puts me six weeks out
[39:46.220 --> 39:52.060]  and that's taking about eight weeks I think. Oh, I need a card. It's all right. It's all right. I
[39:52.060 --> 39:58.700]  grow. I do my thing. Luckily I'm stocked up. We'll be all right. Life is good. Life is never bad.
[39:58.700 --> 40:03.180]  Life's always good. Life's what you make of it. If you're having a shitty time, take a fad dab and
[40:03.180 --> 40:08.860]  fix it. Yep. Yep. Nice fad dab. We'll fix just about any day. Mike, we've been going for about
[40:08.860 --> 40:13.660]  40 minutes. We covered some good points. We did some, uh, we did some educating. We had cannabis
[40:13.660 --> 40:19.420]  news. We had cannabis education and we certainly had cannabis conversation. So we fucking nailed
[40:19.420 --> 40:23.980]  it on this one. We really did. That's three for three people. Boom. Round of applause for you.
[40:23.980 --> 40:27.900]  High five across the table, bro. We nailed that shit. We literally did high five you guys. That
[40:27.900 --> 40:32.460]  was no bullshit. I barely heard that through my headphones. That's really high end sound equipment.
[40:32.460 --> 40:36.540]  It's a compressor. Yeah. I got some compression on there. That was really, really, really nice
[40:36.540 --> 40:45.340]  gear. We don't sound this butter sweet in person. Oh yes I do. I've had people recognize me. I was
[40:45.340 --> 40:49.180]  at a, the mystic root show the other day and somebody goes, you look familiar. And I go,
[40:49.180 --> 40:53.420]  uh, I work at the green and healthy wellness. Um, I read genetics and she's like, nope. And I go,
[40:53.420 --> 40:58.060]  I do a podcast about cannabis. And she goes, Oh my God, that voice. Cause I said it like I do a
[40:58.060 --> 41:01.900]  podcast all about cannabis, just being a smart ass. And she's like, I recognize your voice. So
[41:01.900 --> 41:05.900]  if you still listen, shout out, I don't know if you do, uh, but shout out. It was good to see you.
[41:05.900 --> 41:10.380]  That was, that was fun. Uh, what else we got? I think we got some shout outs. Hey Mike, thanks
[41:10.380 --> 41:14.060]  for joining me, bro. How do my friends that are listening follow you on social media?
[41:14.060 --> 41:20.060]  You can find me at, at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter. And you can find me at Pueblo for sensible
[41:20.060 --> 41:25.740]  cannabis laws on Facebook, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook. Support that click,
[41:25.740 --> 41:30.860]  like go there, uh, comment positive stuff on their support. What we, they are trying to do.
[41:30.860 --> 41:36.700]  I put myself in that. I'm sorry. Support what Mike is trying to do. Um, Mike is probably the
[41:36.700 --> 41:40.860]  leading cannabis activist that I am aware of in this area. I've seen you team up with a few other
[41:40.860 --> 41:45.740]  cool people. So shout out to you guys for doing all that for us. A nice little team put together
[41:45.740 --> 41:50.860]  for this response effort to the, uh, the group trying to ban us. It's a, it's going to be a
[41:50.860 --> 41:56.060]  really fun year for me. Um, I might sleep through all the 2017 at this pace though,
[41:56.060 --> 42:00.620]  cause I'm kind of running myself ragged. No, you've got a little kid. So I really might,
[42:00.620 --> 42:04.860]  I might just throw down every penny I make this year to pay somebody else to keep them alive for,
[42:04.860 --> 42:10.620]  until I wake up from my coma. When, when, when you have a child, sometimes when you're sleeping,
[42:10.620 --> 42:16.860]  you're dreaming about sleeping. Yep. Yep. It's a, I feel like a dick all the times I said I was
[42:16.860 --> 42:21.820]  tired before, like the last 10 months, I almost want to go back and apologize to the people with
[42:21.820 --> 42:25.660]  kids that I was talking to. And I was like, man, I'm too tired. I don't want to be at work today.
[42:25.660 --> 42:29.020]  And they just gave me the look that I give people in their twenties now. And they say that shit at
[42:29.020 --> 42:35.740]  work. Like, yeah, it's crazy people. Yeah. Yeah. We're savages at Argo. So I, yeah, I understand
[42:35.740 --> 42:40.140]  how you're feeling about being tired and, Oh dude, I'm doing like 40 a week at the, at work
[42:40.140 --> 42:45.180]  in another 20 a week on the campaign. And then I've got a 10 month old that I play with for like
[42:45.180 --> 42:50.300]  at least 30 hours a week. So I sleep for like three, five, eight hours a day. If I'm lucky,
[42:51.420 --> 42:55.740]  some of those play hours are random. Sometimes you expect it to be asleep. Two in the morning,
[42:55.740 --> 42:59.660]  we're up playing on the floor and he's in his bounce chair, just going off. And it's like,
[42:59.660 --> 43:06.460]  dude, it's quarter to three. What are you doing? He's going to be like us when he gets older.
[43:07.100 --> 43:11.260]  Oh bro. For some reason, Mike and I are both night owls. I thought it was great when we both
[43:11.260 --> 43:16.060]  discovered that we both liked to be fucking doing whatever happens. We used to build grows
[43:16.060 --> 43:19.260]  and people are like, when can you come do this? But I don't know. Can we show up at like midnight
[43:19.260 --> 43:23.100]  and they think we're fucking crazy, but we'd just crush and grow out while everybody else was gone
[43:23.100 --> 43:27.100]  and build it. And they'd show up in the morning and be like, wow, a grow or the night we trim
[43:27.100 --> 43:31.660]  somebody's crop for them until the sun came up and they woke up and had several pounds trim that
[43:31.660 --> 43:36.300]  weren't trimmed the night before his wife made me leave, go home, get some rest. That was great.
[43:36.300 --> 43:39.980]  All right, guys, thanks for listening. Shout out to elevate glass. Shout out to talk radio.
[43:39.980 --> 43:45.340]  Shout out to my friend, Jessica. Let's see who else. I think that's all I wrote down for shout
[43:45.340 --> 43:54.140]  outs. You guys do shout out to your recent guests. I love the last episode with the barefoot blower.
[43:56.060 --> 43:59.820]  Sorry. Well, that was going to stick. That was going to stick, bro. Sorry.
[44:01.660 --> 44:06.620]  Great show. I've really liked it. Rob from sour seeds. Don't forget Rob. Rob knows a lot about
[44:06.620 --> 44:10.780]  breeding. That's why I try to bring him on for the great episode. I always love it when other
[44:10.780 --> 44:16.540]  people are on. It makes me really wish that I was here to record that and that it makes me want to
[44:16.540 --> 44:21.420]  be a better guest. So great job. Yeah. Hear that, guys. Mike is trying to be a better guest. That's
[44:21.420 --> 44:26.060]  awesome. All right. You notice how I didn't incite anyone to violence the show. I'm trying, guys.
[44:26.060 --> 44:30.300]  I think you said something about becoming an ax murderer at some point. Yeah, that was my personal.
[44:30.300 --> 44:36.460]  That's just where I see my life going. If idiots screw up legalization, that's just
[44:37.900 --> 44:41.820]  a likely possible future. You know what you could do? You could go to iTunes. You could go to the

[46:16.900 --> 46:21.620]  pass around just a little tiny bit, and I want you all to take a smell so you know when someone
[46:21.620 --> 46:23.700]  is smoking marijuana near you.
[47:01.830 --> 47:14.630]  Say, pass the marijuana. Give your thanks and praise today. Pass the marijuana any old kind of way.

[47:38.590 --> 48:12.700]  twice and you still feel nice. Pass the marijuana. Pass the marijuana. I said you know my feelings.
[48:12.700 --> 48:23.500]  Give me such inspiration to look at things another way. I said you help me relax at the end of my day.
[48:24.380 --> 48:35.980]  Lord, so if you feel like I feel, let me hear you say. Pass the marijuana. Give your thanks and praise today.

[49:51.740 --> 49:57.900]  I be filling my mind with knowledge. Has my lungs to fill with smoke. Cough choking on the potent smoke inside my throat.
[49:57.900 --> 50:05.580]  From Chico, California to my home in the bay. Say, we like to smoke out every day. I be northern lights smoking.
[50:05.580 --> 50:10.380]  Hit the joint until I'm choking. My eyes are turning red and I can barely keep them open.
[50:10.380 --> 50:15.340]  The mystic roots be knowing that the way of the walk is long. Ask Sabah, I reach out any kind of shame.
[50:15.340 --> 50:20.700]  I'll say it's on. I got the thin mustache. I need another hit to hash. I smoked on my grass.
[50:20.700 --> 50:25.260]  Just got a pipe full of ash. I'm stanky from the deck and I can only want some more.
[50:25.260 --> 50:29.820]  They call me Koo from Mississippi. Just like I told you before. Give me the green bun.
[50:29.820 --> 50:34.620]  Cause 215 legalized. I be the gun you're gonna sue. I like to crazy crystallize.
[50:34.620 --> 50:40.620]  So pass the marijuana my way. Add some paper so that I can roll a J.
[50:41.260 --> 50:52.140]  I said you know my feelings and now I feel okay. Give me such inspiration to look at things another way.
