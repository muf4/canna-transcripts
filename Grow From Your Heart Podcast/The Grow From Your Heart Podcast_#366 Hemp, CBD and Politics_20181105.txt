[00:00.000 --> 00:01.880]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:01.880 --> 00:05.520]  It's time for episode 366 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.520 --> 00:09.240]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.240 --> 00:13.440]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:13.440 --> 00:15.400]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:15.400 --> 00:21.040]  I'd like to welcome to the show our buddy, White Mike.
[00:21.040 --> 00:22.040]  Welcome, bro.
[00:22.040 --> 00:23.040]  Thanks, man.
[00:23.040 --> 00:24.040]  Thanks for hanging out.
[00:24.040 --> 00:25.040]  It's kind of late.
[00:25.040 --> 00:26.040]  Thanks for being here.
[00:26.040 --> 00:27.040]  Yeah, man.
[00:27.040 --> 00:28.040]  Managed to sneak out and record a show.
[00:28.040 --> 00:29.480]  Dude, I'm glad you did not freeze to death on the way here.
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.600]  It is a frosty, cold Colorado night.
[00:32.600 --> 00:36.960]  I hate being correct with predictions, but I always say that we have to arrange our Halloween
[00:36.960 --> 00:39.080]  costumes around the first snow.
[00:39.080 --> 00:40.280]  You fully do.
[00:40.280 --> 00:44.880]  This was actually the third snow, but we totally got shit weather and we got snow on Halloween.
[00:44.880 --> 00:50.800]  In Colorado, if you're going to do a costume, you need a winter insulated backup or just
[00:50.800 --> 00:54.880]  plan for that, and then just maybe you got to be sweaty all night inside it.
[00:54.880 --> 00:57.080]  It's hard to be Tinkerbell or something like that.
[00:57.680 --> 00:58.680]  Yeah.
[00:58.680 --> 01:03.120]  Sleutty Nurse has a shit night in Colorado every year because it's 20 degrees here on
[01:03.120 --> 01:04.120]  Halloween.
[01:04.120 --> 01:08.440]  I'm glad that you went with Sleutty Nurse as the next option of costume choices.
[01:08.440 --> 01:12.840]  I live in a nicer part of town.
[01:12.840 --> 01:14.800]  It's not as jacked up as other parts.
[01:14.800 --> 01:17.240]  In other parts of town I live, we didn't expect trick-or-treaters.
[01:17.240 --> 01:19.200]  We didn't get none, didn't expect none.
[01:19.200 --> 01:21.000]  Everybody knew that shit was coming.
[01:21.000 --> 01:24.960]  My new neighborhood, you'd expect trick-or-treaters pretty heavy.
[01:24.960 --> 01:26.480]  We saw maybe six kids.
[01:26.880 --> 01:27.880]  There was not much traffic in my neighborhood.
[01:27.880 --> 01:28.880]  It was fucking cold as ass.
[01:28.880 --> 01:29.880]  Yeah.
[01:29.880 --> 01:30.880]  You live in a nice part of town too.
[01:30.880 --> 01:31.880]  I'd expect kids coming here all night.
[01:31.880 --> 01:33.560]  No, it was cold and there was nothing.
[01:33.560 --> 01:38.680]  Luckily, I was Chewbacca and that is just a giant furry bodysuit.
[01:38.680 --> 01:39.680]  I was wearing a fur all night.
[01:39.680 --> 01:42.120]  You were wearing a shag carpet bodysuit, buddy.
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.480]  With a big giant mask that is basically like wearing the IPM suit all day.
[01:46.480 --> 01:48.680]  I've got the respirator on my face.
[01:48.680 --> 01:49.680]  It feels like all night.
[01:49.680 --> 01:50.680]  At least you're not under grow lights.
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.640]  While I was at a show that was quite warm, they were blowing glass right next to the
[01:56.640 --> 01:59.680]  building so a lot of the glass blowing heat was coming.
[01:59.680 --> 02:02.080]  They had live fire spinners at the party.
[02:02.080 --> 02:05.120]  I went to the Heady Halloween event hosted by Elevate Glass.
[02:05.120 --> 02:06.120]  I wanted to get up there.
[02:06.120 --> 02:07.560]  It was such a good time.
[02:07.560 --> 02:08.800]  You know my life, listeners.
[02:08.800 --> 02:09.800]  I do.
[02:09.800 --> 02:10.800]  We do.
[02:10.800 --> 02:11.800]  I think we do.
[02:11.800 --> 02:14.840]  You guys, if you don't know, he's got two kids, which means he's pretty much at home.
[02:14.840 --> 02:19.200]  Sneaking out to record a podcast is the only interesting thing I get to do that's not
[02:19.200 --> 02:20.200]  childcare related.
[02:20.720 --> 02:21.720]  I'm glad you made it.
[02:21.720 --> 02:23.720]  Did you have a good Halloween, bro?
[02:23.720 --> 02:24.720]  Since we're talking about Halloween.
[02:24.720 --> 02:25.720]  It was fucking awesome, dude.
[02:25.720 --> 02:27.720]  Little kids and Halloween are made for each other.
[02:27.720 --> 02:28.720]  Right?
[02:28.720 --> 02:29.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:29.720 --> 02:30.720]  That Halloween smile is magical.
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.000]  Yeah, and the mall here does a thing for the kids and there were a lot of people dressed
[02:35.000 --> 02:36.000]  up in fun costumes tonight.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.000]  It was a good time.
[02:37.000 --> 02:38.000]  That is awesome.
[02:38.000 --> 02:39.440]  I like that the mall lets you go trick or treat.
[02:39.440 --> 02:43.320]  It's a really cool event, especially in Colorado where your Halloween can be miserable and
[02:43.320 --> 02:45.240]  you know 25, 30 degrees.
[02:45.240 --> 02:47.600]  That's no fun when you're a five year old.
[02:47.600 --> 02:50.920]  And so having a place to go where you can trick or treat for an hour and not freeze
[02:50.920 --> 02:52.880]  to death is nice.
[02:52.880 --> 02:54.080]  I know that you're fairly safe.
[02:54.080 --> 02:56.560]  There aren't cars going to run the kids over there in the mall.
[02:56.560 --> 02:57.560]  That's a lot.
[02:57.560 --> 02:59.440]  Actually, a kid got hit in Pueblo West tonight.
[02:59.440 --> 03:00.440]  Oh, that's terrible.
[03:00.440 --> 03:02.560]  I saw that as a right before I came over here.
[03:02.560 --> 03:05.240]  So let's put this podcast back on a positive note.
[03:05.240 --> 03:06.560]  Thanks, Mike.
[03:06.560 --> 03:07.560]  Happy Halloween, everybody.
[03:07.560 --> 03:08.560]  I hope you had a safe Halloween.
[03:08.560 --> 03:09.560]  I hope, uh, no, I'm not.
[03:09.560 --> 03:10.560]  Nevermind.
[03:10.560 --> 03:14.040]  Uh, it's going to make an edibles joke, but we're not even going to make that a tasteless
[03:14.040 --> 03:15.040]  joke.
[03:15.040 --> 03:16.040]  Let's keep going.
[03:16.040 --> 03:19.840]  So Mike, I'm going to give Mike some time to talk about election stuff here in this
[03:19.840 --> 03:20.840]  episode.
[03:20.840 --> 03:21.840]  Mike is here.
[03:21.840 --> 03:22.840]  We'd like to talk about politics.
[03:22.840 --> 03:23.840]  We like to talk about elections.
[03:23.840 --> 03:27.520]  We like to talk about getting people involved before I turn it over to Mike and we start
[03:27.520 --> 03:29.520]  talking about elections and politics.
[03:29.520 --> 03:32.800]  I want to talk about a recent visit to a hemp farm.
[03:32.800 --> 03:36.280]  I was asked to come visit a hemp farm and do a little bit of consultation to help with
[03:36.280 --> 03:37.560]  the project they have coming up.
[03:37.560 --> 03:41.920]  I probably shouldn't talk about their next project, but there is plenty of other stuff
[03:41.920 --> 03:44.060]  I can talk about.
[03:44.060 --> 03:46.020]  So this hemp farm is huge, dude.
[03:46.020 --> 03:47.020]  Huge.
[03:47.020 --> 03:48.460]  This is what I want to hear about.
[03:48.460 --> 03:49.460]  This place is huge.
[03:49.460 --> 03:53.420]  I've never been to a legal Colorado hemp farm.
[03:53.420 --> 03:56.820]  I've never been to an illegal Colorado hemp farm either.
[03:56.820 --> 03:59.420]  I just know hemp farms from Mike.
[03:59.420 --> 04:04.060]  I've never thought of working or being involved in a farm that large.
[04:04.060 --> 04:08.260]  All of the plants are harvested on their outdoor field, but the field, you can't see the end
[04:08.260 --> 04:09.260]  of it.
[04:09.260 --> 04:10.260]  I was like, Hey, I'm looking for this guy.
[04:10.260 --> 04:12.540]  And they're like, he's way out there at the end of the field.
[04:12.540 --> 04:13.540]  And I was like, that's him.
[04:14.020 --> 04:15.780]  And they're like, yeah, he'll be out here in like 20 or 30 minutes.
[04:15.780 --> 04:20.060]  Because it took him like 20 or 30 minutes to walk from that field to where I was basically.
[04:20.060 --> 04:21.200]  He was way out there.
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.260]  He was only an inch tall from how far away I could see him.
[04:24.260 --> 04:25.260]  That field is huge.
[04:25.260 --> 04:26.260]  They've got a lot of plants out there.
[04:26.260 --> 04:27.260]  They have a lot of space.
[04:27.260 --> 04:29.820]  There's a couple of massive farms here in Puebla.
[04:29.820 --> 04:30.820]  And it's kind of hidden.
[04:30.820 --> 04:31.820]  It's kind of camouflaged.
[04:31.820 --> 04:34.820]  It's on a hill to where if you're not looking for it, you wouldn't even know it's there.
[04:34.820 --> 04:39.180]  You can see the buildings and the greenhouses and the farms, but the outdoor grow space
[04:39.180 --> 04:43.060]  is kind of tucked down into where when you're driving up on the highway that takes you to
[04:43.580 --> 04:44.860]  it, you don't even see where the plants would be.
[04:44.860 --> 04:45.860]  It's kind of neat.
[04:45.860 --> 04:46.860]  Yeah.
[04:46.860 --> 04:48.620]  So they've got a bunch of gigantic plants out there.
[04:48.620 --> 04:50.020]  They've got several greenhouses.
[04:50.020 --> 04:51.920]  They've got several barns.
[04:51.920 --> 04:57.660]  They have got more plants in that facility, the capability of more plants in that facility
[04:57.660 --> 05:03.340]  than probably 10 of the indoor environments that we used to run.
[05:03.340 --> 05:05.940]  The size and the plant counts at hemp farms are nuts.
[05:05.940 --> 05:10.740]  Like I've seen some of the background info and I follow this stuff closely enough in
[05:10.740 --> 05:16.260]  the press that you catch some of this tangentially, but the numbers you see for hemp are insane.
[05:16.260 --> 05:18.420]  They had a lot of plants and they were huge.
[05:18.420 --> 05:20.140]  They had a lot of product.
[05:20.140 --> 05:24.100]  I'm not going to say where I was so that I can say more about what I saw.
[05:24.100 --> 05:25.260]  I feel like I can't do both.
[05:25.260 --> 05:26.260]  I don't want to reveal-
[05:26.260 --> 05:27.260]  Right.
[05:27.260 --> 05:29.020]  You can tell us about Bob's house if you don't name Bob.
[05:29.020 --> 05:30.020]  Yeah.
[05:30.020 --> 05:33.400]  So I saw, I don't know what the names of these containers are.
[05:33.400 --> 05:37.420]  It looks like you took a mail carrier's bag.
[05:37.420 --> 05:40.940]  So that durable canvas work type material?
[05:40.940 --> 05:41.940]  Yeah.
[05:41.940 --> 05:45.780]  But it was the size that you could put a Volkswagen Beetle into it.
[05:45.780 --> 05:53.260]  And they filled these canvas bags with ground material ready to be turned into CBD oils
[05:53.260 --> 05:59.660]  and concentrates to go into salves and rubs and tinctures and lip balms and anything you
[05:59.660 --> 06:04.300]  can imagine you could put CBD in to apply to your body.
[06:04.300 --> 06:06.520]  They've got that sort of delivery method.
[06:06.620 --> 06:11.000]  I saw a whole bunch of extraction equipment that is beyond where I've even thought of.
[06:11.000 --> 06:12.600]  They've got their own lab testing in there.
[06:12.600 --> 06:13.600]  They can do-
[06:13.600 --> 06:15.200]  They're ready to roll for national.
[06:15.200 --> 06:16.200]  Yeah.
[06:16.200 --> 06:18.000]  They're trying to be prepared for when things go up there.
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.000]  That's their goal.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.480]  They told me they're ready for when the FDA comes, that they can already pass FDA testing.
[06:23.480 --> 06:27.800]  There's strong odds that happens well before high THC cannabis.
[06:27.800 --> 06:30.760]  And we can get into sort of what exactly is hemp in a minute.
[06:30.760 --> 06:31.760]  That's part of my notes.
[06:31.760 --> 06:34.160]  I'm glad you want to go that way.
[06:34.160 --> 06:41.440]  The odds are strong that the feds lay off hemp and CBD long before they lay off cannabis
[06:41.440 --> 06:43.240]  as a whole.
[06:43.240 --> 06:48.760]  Even Paul Ryan, if you follow politics, not a pro-cannabis guy, not a liberal guy, was
[06:48.760 --> 06:54.200]  just in the press touting CBD and industrial hemp and lamenting the fact that federal law
[06:54.200 --> 06:58.160]  still prohibits just like it's high THC marijuana.
[06:58.160 --> 07:06.800]  I agree with you that CBD will be more acceptable legally before THC because it already, it
[07:06.800 --> 07:07.800]  is.
[07:07.800 --> 07:12.640]  If you look at the production facilities, if you look at the way it's done, if we have
[07:12.640 --> 07:19.840]  more than 0.3% THC in our plant, it is now considered cannabis and it can't be grown
[07:19.840 --> 07:21.600]  in a hemp farm.
[07:21.600 --> 07:23.760]  That's a legal distinction here in Colorado.
[07:23.760 --> 07:24.760]  Yes.
[07:24.760 --> 07:25.760]  That's what declares the difference.
[07:25.920 --> 07:28.440]  We're going to talk more about that in a minute.
[07:28.440 --> 07:33.920]  One of the first things I noticed, I am from the commercial cannabis environment, the recreational
[07:33.920 --> 07:40.180]  and medical cannabis environment where you have to have a badge with a long extensive
[07:40.180 --> 07:41.180]  background check.
[07:41.180 --> 07:43.640]  You can renew your stuff online by the way and it's super simple.
[07:43.640 --> 07:44.640]  I just did it.
[07:44.640 --> 07:45.640]  It took me 15 minutes, bro.
[07:45.640 --> 07:49.260]  I re-up right after they instituted that process.
[07:49.260 --> 07:51.120]  In the office they were like, you're dumb.
[07:51.120 --> 07:52.120]  There's an easier way.
[07:52.120 --> 07:53.120]  Yeah.
[07:53.120 --> 07:54.120]  Well, anyway, you can do it online.
[07:54.480 --> 07:57.440]  If you need to renew your MED badge, it's super simple online.
[07:57.440 --> 08:01.240]  You don't have to have the form notarized and you don't need the fingerprints unless
[08:01.240 --> 08:04.720]  you are going for an associated key badge or higher.
[08:04.720 --> 08:09.920]  If you just have a basic key badge, the lady at the MED told me, I do not need a new fingerprint
[08:09.920 --> 08:10.920]  card.
[08:10.920 --> 08:13.880]  She told me to turn in the application and if I need it, they'll email me and let me
[08:13.880 --> 08:14.880]  know what I need.
[08:14.880 --> 08:15.880]  She goes, just turn it in.
[08:15.880 --> 08:16.960]  Everybody has problems.
[08:16.960 --> 08:20.100]  She seemed confident that nine out of 10 people are going to have issues and she has to call
[08:20.100 --> 08:21.100]  them back and it's no big deal.
[08:21.100 --> 08:22.100]  She's like, just turn it in.
[08:22.100 --> 08:23.600]  I want to get back on track here.
[08:24.360 --> 08:30.400]  So to work in the Colorado regulated marijuana business, you have to have a marijuana enforcement
[08:30.400 --> 08:33.120]  division badge, which you have to have a federal background check.
[08:33.120 --> 08:35.840]  You have to do at least one fingerprint thing.
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.520]  You have to fill out a bunch of paperwork and if you have any legal background, you
[08:39.520 --> 08:42.680]  have to clear that up and prove to Colorado that you're going to be a good kid and you're
[08:42.680 --> 08:44.680]  not going to go crazy in the industry.
[08:44.680 --> 08:48.060]  I know people that had to drive across the country and go to the courthouse.
[08:48.060 --> 08:53.580]  They got sentenced and in pull paperwork by hand that said their shit was adjudicated
[08:53.580 --> 08:54.940]  and completed successfully.
[08:54.940 --> 08:56.020]  That's an actual thing.
[08:56.020 --> 09:00.140]  It's a nightmare applying for that badge sometimes.
[09:00.140 --> 09:04.740]  Some of the people that are in the hemp industry are there because they have been blocked from
[09:04.740 --> 09:07.580]  the cannabis industry because of their colored past.
[09:07.580 --> 09:09.660]  They are not allowed is colored past racist.
[09:09.660 --> 09:10.660]  Is that rude?
[09:10.660 --> 09:11.660]  I'm trying to be politically correct.
[09:11.660 --> 09:12.660]  Checkered past.
[09:12.660 --> 09:13.660]  What do you say?
[09:13.660 --> 09:14.660]  They're checking past, right?
[09:14.660 --> 09:15.660]  Yeah.
[09:15.660 --> 09:16.660]  They can't be in the industry because of their checkered past.
[09:16.660 --> 09:18.980]  Everything I said came across as politically incorrect.
[09:18.980 --> 09:21.100]  I'm trying to be accurate lately.
[09:21.100 --> 09:22.420]  Play the TBI card real quick.
[09:22.420 --> 09:23.420]  Right.
[09:23.420 --> 09:24.420]  Yeah.
[09:24.420 --> 09:25.420]  I hit my head one day.
[09:25.420 --> 09:26.420]  I get words confused anyway.
[09:26.420 --> 09:32.620]  So listeners, if you're confused about what the difference between like marijuana, hemp
[09:32.620 --> 09:36.660]  and cannabis, I feel like this is the time in the show where we should cover that.
[09:36.660 --> 09:38.340]  We're going to get there, but I wanted, I was teasing.
[09:38.340 --> 09:42.220]  I was really teasing about when we have to have a badge to work there.
[09:42.220 --> 09:44.940]  Then the facility has to be, you have to check in.
[09:45.060 --> 09:46.780]  When you go into the facility, you ring the doorbell.
[09:46.780 --> 09:47.780]  You can't get in.
[09:47.780 --> 09:48.780]  You ring the doorbell.
[09:48.780 --> 09:50.900]  Mike or I runs to the door like, Oh, it's you.
[09:50.900 --> 09:52.020]  Do you have a reason to be in here?
[09:52.020 --> 09:57.620]  I've had building inspectors a little surprised that they were having to sign in and put on
[09:57.620 --> 10:00.900]  a lanyard and it's, dude, this is a secure facility.
[10:00.900 --> 10:05.600]  You can't just open my door and run from a secure facility is the greatest words.
[10:05.600 --> 10:06.600]  You have to sign in.
[10:06.600 --> 10:09.420]  You have to show me your ID that says who you are.
[10:09.420 --> 10:10.940]  You have to sign in.
[10:10.940 --> 10:14.300]  Then I give you a lanyard that says whatever the name of my facility is.
[10:14.660 --> 10:15.660]  And then it says visitor.
[10:15.660 --> 10:20.140]  So let's say Mike and Jeff's grow visitor and you have this big thing and somebody has
[10:20.140 --> 10:21.640]  to be with you the entire time.
[10:21.640 --> 10:25.420]  You have to be escorted in visual sight.
[10:25.420 --> 10:29.340]  Also nothing can be visible in a marijuana grow and a cannabis grow.
[10:29.340 --> 10:33.580]  If you drive by and you can see cannabis through the fence, they are in violation.
[10:33.580 --> 10:35.620]  That is completely illegal.
[10:35.620 --> 10:39.180]  In a hemp grow, dude, just a fence.
[10:39.180 --> 10:42.100]  Just like a six foot tall fence and 12 foot tall plants.
[10:42.100 --> 10:46.820]  It depends on the County and if you can see it, that's a hard and fast store rule.
[10:46.820 --> 10:50.260]  But with some of the production facilities, especially here in Pueblo County, we allow
[10:50.260 --> 10:52.260]  outdoor cultivation.
[10:52.260 --> 10:58.020]  There's fencing rules, but if you can see over the fence, that's not one of the rules.
[10:58.020 --> 11:03.320]  These guys, there are no MED requirements in a hemp farm is where I'm headed.
[11:03.320 --> 11:05.140]  That's one thing I want to see in practice.
[11:05.140 --> 11:07.220]  No badges, no badges at all.
[11:07.220 --> 11:08.620]  Nobody had to have a badge there.
[11:08.620 --> 11:11.900]  There were no cameras that I saw and I'm not trying to say go do anything, but there are
[11:11.900 --> 11:12.900]  no cameras.
[11:12.900 --> 11:13.900]  You're not.
[11:13.900 --> 11:17.820]  So in a MED regulated facility, you can't walk from one part of the building to the
[11:17.820 --> 11:20.580]  other and have any gaps where you are not seen.
[11:20.580 --> 11:23.420]  You have to be fully on camera at all times.
[11:23.420 --> 11:27.220]  So if you were wiping your nose, picking your nose, scratching your butt, itching your balls,
[11:27.220 --> 11:28.220]  you're on camera.
[11:28.220 --> 11:29.220]  Redundantly.
[11:29.220 --> 11:34.200]  It's not in this room, there's a camera on that wall.
[11:34.200 --> 11:35.900]  There's a camera on every wall.
[11:35.900 --> 11:36.900]  Every wall.
[11:36.900 --> 11:37.900]  Yes.
[11:38.900 --> 11:43.860]  The MED requirements for legal cannabis in Colorado are nuts.
[11:43.860 --> 11:44.860]  It's overkill.
[11:44.860 --> 11:46.540]  But so there are no cameras.
[11:46.540 --> 11:48.760]  And the fencing, like I said, was minimal.
[11:48.760 --> 11:51.300]  So it's really like a relaxed environment.
[11:51.300 --> 11:52.860]  It's not as uptight.
[11:52.860 --> 11:56.380]  It doesn't feel so crazy and government-regulated.
[11:56.380 --> 11:59.460]  It doesn't feel like a hospital and like a prison at the same time.
[11:59.460 --> 12:07.460]  I've worked with people who just came from that industry and the rules that the MED has
[12:07.460 --> 12:12.180]  us following, watching them adjust to those was really funny.
[12:12.180 --> 12:15.260]  If you didn't have to do...
[12:15.260 --> 12:19.020]  No matter if we were MED regulated or not, we would have to tag plants.
[12:19.020 --> 12:20.540]  We would have to keep notes.
[12:20.540 --> 12:26.420]  If you didn't have to do anything involving the MED, how much time do you think you would
[12:26.420 --> 12:29.580]  save in a day?
[12:29.580 --> 12:31.220]  It depends on the size of the building.
[12:31.220 --> 12:35.340]  But I'm just thinking of the last facility that we kind of ran together.
[12:35.340 --> 12:37.740]  We're talking about several people that aren't on the payroll.
[12:37.740 --> 12:38.740]  Right.
[12:38.740 --> 12:39.740]  You could just...
[12:39.740 --> 12:40.740]  Several.
[12:40.740 --> 12:44.060]  I'm not on the payroll.
[12:44.060 --> 12:47.980]  The other outside consultant that helped with compliance probably wouldn't even be necessary.
[12:47.980 --> 12:51.100]  There's at least three people in our immediate work team.
[12:51.100 --> 12:52.860]  The guy that was right underneath you?
[12:52.860 --> 12:53.860]  The guy that was right...
[12:53.860 --> 12:56.500]  Me, the guy that was right underneath me, and the two people right above me.
[12:56.500 --> 12:57.820]  None of those people need to be there.
[12:57.820 --> 12:59.220]  Just be gone because there's no MED.
[12:59.220 --> 13:00.220]  Yeah, there's no MED.
[13:00.220 --> 13:02.580]  The two above you were high-salary people.
[13:02.580 --> 13:03.580]  Yeah.
[13:03.580 --> 13:04.580]  Yeah.
[13:04.820 --> 13:07.660]  Not super high, but I mean, decently salaried people.
[13:07.660 --> 13:08.660]  Okay.
[13:08.660 --> 13:14.940]  But yeah, so we could get rid of four employees, two hourly, one entry-level, one managerial,
[13:14.940 --> 13:16.380]  and then two consultant-level employees.
[13:16.380 --> 13:19.500]  I'm thinking about grow team.
[13:19.500 --> 13:23.180]  I mean, do hemp farms need to weigh their waste leaf?
[13:23.180 --> 13:24.180]  No.
[13:24.180 --> 13:25.180]  That is...
[13:25.180 --> 13:26.740]  Do they need to pulverize their garbage?
[13:26.740 --> 13:30.620]  How many hours did we kill on that shredder?
[13:30.620 --> 13:32.900]  I mean, a man-hours in the facility.
[13:32.900 --> 13:37.380]  So just to let you guys know what we're talking about, in a MED-regulated facility, after
[13:37.380 --> 13:40.140]  you harvest a plant, you've got all the sticks and stalks.
[13:40.140 --> 13:42.360]  They've got to go somewhere.
[13:42.360 --> 13:46.140]  We can't just throw it in the trash that the city picks up or that a private company picks
[13:46.140 --> 13:47.140]  up.
[13:47.140 --> 13:51.420]  We've got to run it through a wood chipper to make it unrecognizable so that nobody can
[13:51.420 --> 13:53.180]  identify what it is or was.
[13:53.180 --> 13:55.380]  The MED wants it into tiny little pieces.
[13:55.380 --> 13:58.860]  We would also run a bunch of old leaves through that chipper because we didn't have anywhere
[13:58.860 --> 13:59.860]  else to put them.
[13:59.860 --> 14:01.940]  They had to be shredded and destroyed.
[14:01.980 --> 14:06.460]  We would send Brian out there with a pack of cigarettes and a wood chipper, and he would
[14:06.460 --> 14:10.340]  honestly spend Saturday, every Saturday, just chipping.
[14:10.340 --> 14:11.340]  That was his whole job.
[14:11.340 --> 14:15.580]  Towards the end there, we had it on a rotation, and I'm trying to remember how often we had
[14:15.580 --> 14:16.780]  to run it.
[14:16.780 --> 14:25.540]  It was once or twice a week for at least five or six hours a sesh.
[14:25.540 --> 14:26.540]  Yeah.
[14:26.540 --> 14:29.500]  Because that was before we doubled our production.
[14:29.500 --> 14:30.500]  Once you get the boys out there-
[14:30.500 --> 14:31.580]  That was at our original set.
[14:32.220 --> 14:33.220]  You have the bags of material out there.
[14:33.220 --> 14:34.740]  You've got the chipper running.
[14:34.740 --> 14:35.740]  It's all fired up.
[14:35.740 --> 14:36.740]  It's out of the trailer.
[14:36.740 --> 14:38.860]  It's a lot of work to do it.
[14:38.860 --> 14:41.140]  That's not required on a hemp farm.
[14:41.140 --> 14:47.140]  When you start researching the different applications for industrial hemp, one of the things that
[14:47.140 --> 14:51.820]  they're not real explicit about upfront when you're learning about this is that you have
[14:51.820 --> 14:53.340]  to pick one.
[14:53.340 --> 14:59.540]  If you're growing for seed oil production, you run your harvest one kind of way.
[14:59.540 --> 15:04.660]  If you grow a certain variety of hemp that produces heavily for what you're seeking,
[15:04.660 --> 15:10.100]  if you're looking to make clothes from fiber, different genus of hemp, both of those two
[15:10.100 --> 15:18.780]  different varieties are going to have very low percent THC, less than 0.3%.
[15:18.780 --> 15:24.740]  But they're going to produce a very different looking plant, and you're going to need very
[15:24.740 --> 15:28.660]  different equipment, very different retail markets.
[15:28.780 --> 15:29.780]  All of it's different.
[15:29.780 --> 15:38.780]  You can't grow for fiber and for seed oil and for replacement seed and hempcrete.
[15:38.780 --> 15:43.140]  This farm actually, I'm not going to say who they were.
[15:43.140 --> 15:46.020]  People may figure it out, but I feel like I can talk more about their business if I
[15:46.020 --> 15:48.300]  don't say who they are, is what I said earlier.
[15:48.300 --> 15:54.100]  They received a delivery from another farm that they're going to turn into products.
[15:54.100 --> 15:57.260]  As they were breaking it up, they discovered seeds in it.
[15:57.260 --> 16:01.340]  They realized that they have to pull out every seed because if they leave the seeds
[16:01.340 --> 16:06.700]  in there, it will change the spectrum of the oil they're creating.
[16:06.700 --> 16:10.260]  That's one of their levels of quality control that they go through out there.
[16:10.260 --> 16:17.260]  There's so many different things that you can do with an industrial hemp plant, but
[16:17.260 --> 16:22.020]  the setup to get into it and get it up and rolling is very intensive.
[16:22.020 --> 16:23.540]  They've got a really nice setup.
[16:24.540 --> 16:28.820]  Can you imagine farming cannabis on high THC or on that scale, bro?
[16:28.820 --> 16:30.140]  I would love it.
[16:30.140 --> 16:35.780]  What's the difference between producing high CBD flowers out there and producing high THC
[16:35.780 --> 16:39.700]  flowers out there other than a lab test and a phenotype?
[16:39.700 --> 16:43.860]  You said earlier you wanted to talk about what constitutes hemp and what constitutes
[16:43.860 --> 16:45.500]  cannabis.
[16:45.500 --> 16:49.820]  If you drove up and you didn't know the difference, you couldn't tell the difference in those
[16:49.820 --> 16:50.900]  plants by looking.
[16:50.900 --> 16:53.020]  They look just like ganja plants.
[16:53.020 --> 16:57.420]  They look just like high THC cannabis plants that we grew in a facility together.
[16:57.420 --> 16:58.860]  There is no visual difference.
[16:58.860 --> 17:03.140]  When you smell them, they do have a cherry aroma that since I'm experienced and I know
[17:03.140 --> 17:07.860]  what I'm looking for, I can identify that as part of what comes with CBD.
[17:07.860 --> 17:09.460]  But visually, there's no difference.
[17:09.460 --> 17:11.420]  They are structurally the same.
[17:11.420 --> 17:12.740]  They flower just the same.
[17:12.740 --> 17:14.820]  The leaves, they were flushing one batch.
[17:14.820 --> 17:16.980]  The leaves look just the same.
[17:16.980 --> 17:18.820]  There's no visual difference.
[17:18.820 --> 17:24.660]  The only thing that gives you in Colorado, the only thing that gives you a variance between
[17:24.660 --> 17:27.060]  marijuana or cannabis and hemp-
[17:27.060 --> 17:28.100]  Is that lab test.
[17:28.100 --> 17:29.100]  Is that lab test.
[17:29.100 --> 17:30.100]  That's it.
[17:30.100 --> 17:37.820]  If your plant has 0.3% THC or higher, it is considered marijuana or cannabis.
[17:37.820 --> 17:41.300]  Without that 3%, you're not working with legal hemp.
[17:41.300 --> 17:48.580]  I'm not entirely sure that I had put two and two together in my head that they're extracting
[17:49.340 --> 17:52.940]  the CBD from the bud material just like we do with THC.
[17:52.940 --> 17:53.940]  Exactly.
[17:53.940 --> 17:57.220]  For some reason, I was thinking something out of the seed oil.
[17:57.220 --> 18:00.060]  I probably knew this.
[18:00.060 --> 18:02.580]  I just didn't realize it and put it together.
[18:02.580 --> 18:06.900]  They're growing full blown flowers out there to finish, to maturity.
[18:06.900 --> 18:11.060]  And then they run, I don't want to give away, I don't know how they do it exactly, but I
[18:11.060 --> 18:13.580]  saw several different extraction methods out there.
[18:13.580 --> 18:15.060]  I saw large batches of crude.
[18:15.060 --> 18:16.700]  I saw batches of distillate.
[18:16.700 --> 18:18.500]  I saw crystalline.
[18:18.540 --> 18:20.220]  They explained a few different ways that they do it.
[18:20.220 --> 18:23.140]  They explained the ways that they prefer to do it and their optional methods that they
[18:23.140 --> 18:26.780]  don't like to do, but they will because it's required sometimes.
[18:26.780 --> 18:31.620]  They've got their own lab test to make sure that there is no THC in there.
[18:31.620 --> 18:37.900]  Then they've got the capability to remove the THC molecules from the products or the
[18:37.900 --> 18:39.900]  oils that they make, the extractions that they make.
[18:39.900 --> 18:44.740]  One of my questions was going to be, are they working with any other cannabinoids?
[18:44.740 --> 18:49.660]  They're kind of banned from working with THC above what, 0.3%?
[18:49.660 --> 18:50.980]  0.3%, yeah.
[18:50.980 --> 18:53.580]  They could work with any of the others.
[18:53.580 --> 18:54.580]  Right.
[18:54.580 --> 18:56.340]  Well, not THCA, but you get what I mean.
[18:56.340 --> 18:57.700]  I don't know the legalities.
[18:57.700 --> 18:59.940]  Maybe they could work with CBG or CBN.
[18:59.940 --> 19:00.940]  I don't know the legalities on any of that.
[19:00.940 --> 19:02.780]  CBN was what I was thinking.
[19:02.780 --> 19:08.060]  Because CBN's the next, people are thinking that one plays a big part in anti-inflammation.
[19:08.060 --> 19:09.060]  Awesome.
[19:09.060 --> 19:13.620]  And so there are a lot of people looking for a high CBN strain.
[19:13.620 --> 19:14.620]  Right.
[19:15.000 --> 19:17.860]  That's a good way to keep down the inflammation and combine that with the CBD.
[19:17.860 --> 19:19.580]  It should work very well.
[19:19.580 --> 19:24.420]  So yeah, I think the only difference that we have decided is that 0.3 test.
[19:24.420 --> 19:29.020]  I keep going back to that for some reason, but that 0.3 makes it cannabis.
[19:29.020 --> 19:30.380]  Less than that makes it hemp.
[19:30.380 --> 19:31.820]  So they look exactly the same, dude.
[19:31.820 --> 19:33.860]  They run it like you were saying.
[19:33.860 --> 19:38.740]  They make the extractions just like they would if they were going to run a THC extraction.
[19:38.740 --> 19:44.260]  It is all the same, except they're aiming for just a pure CBD product and no THC.
[19:44.900 --> 19:47.540]  So that is kind of a good section to segue into my next note.
[19:47.540 --> 19:52.300]  My next note says, hemp CBD is CBD.
[19:52.300 --> 19:57.180]  There are some people in the cannabis community, the recreational and or the medical community
[19:57.180 --> 20:06.300]  that will argue that hemp derived CBD is less quality or what's the word, inferior to cannabis
[20:06.300 --> 20:08.840]  derived CBD.
[20:08.840 --> 20:11.660]  Can you back me up in saying that that's the same molecule?
[20:11.980 --> 20:15.220]  It's the same.
[20:15.220 --> 20:23.540]  There is a very valid argument to be made that knowing and trusting your CBD supplier
[20:23.540 --> 20:30.780]  right now is crucial because the place you just toured isn't the only place producing
[20:30.780 --> 20:32.580]  CBD right now.
[20:32.580 --> 20:38.820]  There are countless places around the US in the different, in, shit, there's probably
[20:38.980 --> 20:45.460]  12 or 15 different states that have a hemp industry right now on some scale or another.
[20:45.460 --> 20:50.540]  And there's countless CBD producers that are producing God only knows what and slapping
[20:50.540 --> 20:51.540]  CBD on the label.
[20:51.540 --> 20:52.540]  There's also Chinese CBD.
[20:52.540 --> 20:53.540]  Yep.
[20:53.540 --> 20:58.060]  And then there's all of this stuff coming in from around the globe.
[20:58.060 --> 21:01.100]  And just some of these places just write CBD on fish oil.
[21:01.100 --> 21:02.100]  Yeah.
[21:02.100 --> 21:03.700]  I talked about that in another episode.
[21:03.700 --> 21:09.740]  Other places you're legitimately getting exactly what's on the label, but distinguishing
[21:09.740 --> 21:13.260]  the two is not something everyone's capable of.
[21:13.260 --> 21:14.260]  Right.
[21:14.260 --> 21:16.300]  And some people will believe in the placebo and keep buying it.
[21:16.300 --> 21:26.460]  But buying hemp derived CBD from a trusted supplier and buying CBD that's been extracted
[21:26.460 --> 21:32.700]  from high THC cannabis varieties, there's no difference in those CBDs other than one
[21:32.700 --> 21:36.780]  of them was grown in a flower where it was in a higher concentration and one of them
[21:36.780 --> 21:40.020]  was grown in a flower with a lower concentration.
[21:40.020 --> 21:45.180]  They were both extracted to whatever concentration the extractor wanted.
[21:45.180 --> 21:46.700]  It's just where they're getting their source material.
[21:46.700 --> 21:51.180]  That's part of the reason CBD is so expensive in the medical and recreational markets is
[21:51.180 --> 21:57.020]  because they're growing high THC plants and trying to extract the 1% of CBD into a whole
[21:57.020 --> 22:00.080]  gram jar takes for fucking ever.
[22:00.080 --> 22:05.520]  There was a big push from the, I mean, when I say established industry at this point in
[22:05.520 --> 22:10.160]  time, they weren't much more established than your local hotdog vendor.
[22:10.160 --> 22:17.400]  But the established industry at the time when Colorado first was like, well, fuck, we might
[22:17.400 --> 22:21.480]  as well write the hemp rules that were forced to write by amendment 64.
[22:21.480 --> 22:24.780]  We'll go ahead and write those this next year.
[22:24.780 --> 22:28.120]  When they started to do that, the medical industry that had been around for a minute
[22:28.200 --> 22:32.360]  in the emerging rec market, we're like, yeah, it's totally different.
[22:32.360 --> 22:33.640]  It's totally different molecule.
[22:33.640 --> 22:34.640]  It's totally different.
[22:34.640 --> 22:37.240]  You need to buy your shit off our shelf still.
[22:37.240 --> 22:38.800]  Everybody got scared.
[22:38.800 --> 22:40.440]  It's not at all the same.
[22:40.440 --> 22:44.680]  And that argument flared back up big time when the FDA had to send warning letters to
[22:44.680 --> 22:49.440]  some of the Chinese imports saying, knock that shit off and knock it off with the bogus
[22:49.440 --> 22:52.160]  health claims you can't prove.
[22:52.160 --> 22:53.640]  I'm going to hit myself up a dab.
[22:53.640 --> 22:56.360]  I'm going to take a dab of high THC medicine.
[22:56.360 --> 23:02.000]  I have got high THC or if you would like a high CBD dab, I've got that to offer you
[23:02.000 --> 23:04.600]  as well since we've been talking about CBD so much.
[23:04.600 --> 23:09.600]  I don't prefer to consume CBD myself, but I thought I would offer that to you.
[23:09.600 --> 23:13.120]  Then once we take these dabs, Mike, we've been going for quite a while, so we should
[23:13.120 --> 23:18.640]  wrap up this hemp farm talk and we should start talking about all of the political activism
[23:18.640 --> 23:20.680]  that you bring to the table.
[23:20.680 --> 23:22.360]  Just before we close out, I'm a little jealous.
[23:22.360 --> 23:25.000]  I'd like to go see a huge hemp farm.
[23:25.120 --> 23:27.920]  I'm having fun picking it apart in my head right now.
[23:27.920 --> 23:32.160]  Well, I'll be doing consulting for them, so maybe I'll just take you out there and say
[23:32.160 --> 23:33.840]  that you're my assistant one of these days.
[23:33.840 --> 23:37.080]  You just carry a notebook and write down weird shit.
[23:37.080 --> 23:40.000]  Just draw pictures of weird stuff the whole time.
[23:40.000 --> 23:41.000]  Yeah.
[23:41.000 --> 23:45.080]  We'll figure out something.
[23:45.080 --> 23:48.800]  There's a high likelihood I'll go see a new grow tomorrow, but it's not a hemp grow.
[23:48.800 --> 23:49.800]  Do you need an assistant?
[23:49.800 --> 23:50.800]  Maybe.
[23:50.800 --> 23:53.080]  I'm going to go see new grows also.
[23:53.080 --> 23:54.080]  All right.
[23:54.160 --> 23:58.360]  Before we go to this dab, I'm going to dab some Copper Chem from Green Dot Labs.
[23:58.360 --> 24:00.800]  It's the Copper Chem full spectrum extract.
[24:00.800 --> 24:02.440]  It is Chem 4 and Star Dog.
[24:02.440 --> 24:07.400]  The label says perfumey chem, assorted fruit bonbons.
[24:07.400 --> 24:08.400]  I don't get that.
[24:08.400 --> 24:10.880]  I get fuel and funk, so I'm going to hit it and enjoy this.
[24:10.880 --> 24:11.880]  Mike, say something for me.
[24:11.880 --> 24:17.880]  Yeah, it smells like gas and old fruit to me, but that's a good thing.
[24:17.880 --> 24:21.400]  You wouldn't take that as a good thing, but I fully think it is.
[24:21.400 --> 24:25.480]  While you're hitting that dab, let's dive into election stuff.
[24:25.480 --> 24:27.600]  Ready for some politics, listeners?
[24:27.600 --> 24:28.600]  Go hit something on.
[24:28.600 --> 24:32.160]  I'll finish this dab of Jeff's real quick.
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.240]  Yeah, I definitely didn't take all that on to choke.
[24:36.240 --> 24:41.280]  If this episode drops on the night we think it will, you never know.
[24:41.280 --> 24:43.720]  I can make that happen.
[24:43.720 --> 24:46.320]  We know a guy.
[24:46.320 --> 24:52.280]  This will drop Monday before Tuesday's election.
[24:52.280 --> 24:55.240]  Hopefully everybody listening is registered to vote.
[24:55.240 --> 25:00.000]  Hopefully most of the people listening have taken advantage of early voting in some fashion.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.840]  In Colorado, it's all mail-in elections now.
[25:03.840 --> 25:05.600]  It's so super easy.
[25:05.600 --> 25:08.480]  You register to vote when you do your driver's license.
[25:08.480 --> 25:09.920]  Shit shows up at your house.
[25:09.920 --> 25:10.920]  You fill it out.
[25:10.920 --> 25:13.280]  You drop it off or mail it back in.
[25:13.280 --> 25:16.040]  Couldn't be easier.
[25:16.040 --> 25:19.720]  This is on the ballot in several states, including Colorado.
[25:19.720 --> 25:23.840]  I just wanted to take a minute on today's show to encourage everybody, regardless of
[25:23.840 --> 25:27.440]  which way you lead on the political spectrum, to vote.
[25:27.440 --> 25:29.640]  Super important that people vote.
[25:29.640 --> 25:36.040]  We would not be led by an angry orange Cheeto if more people voted.
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.600]  Over half the country doesn't vote every election, and that just drives me insane.
[25:40.600 --> 25:44.000]  It's not like half the country has felonies and can't.
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.600]  Half the country decides it's unimportant or their vote doesn't matter.
[25:48.600 --> 25:51.800]  They come up with some other lame-ass excuse to dodge it.
[25:51.800 --> 25:57.920]  Then we end up with assholes who want to be assholes getting to make all the rules.
[25:57.920 --> 26:00.280]  A lot of people say, well, my vote doesn't matter.
[26:00.280 --> 26:01.280]  Then let me have it.
[26:01.280 --> 26:03.800]  But the thing is, you got to go do it for me.
[26:03.800 --> 26:07.280]  You say, just listen to Mike and I.
[26:07.280 --> 26:11.600]  Your vote matters to us, so just do that for us, even if you're not doing it for you.
[26:11.600 --> 26:18.600]  In my younger years, my non-parent years, I would identify the people in my immediate
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.160]  social circle who were going to come up with one of those ideas.
[26:23.160 --> 26:28.480]  I'd just show up on election day and be like, what up, Jeff?
[26:28.480 --> 26:29.480]  What are you doing today?
[26:29.480 --> 26:30.480]  Let's fill out that ballot.
[26:30.480 --> 26:31.480]  Nice.
[26:31.480 --> 26:32.480]  All right, get in the car.
[26:32.480 --> 26:33.480]  Let's go down to the polling place.
[26:33.480 --> 26:36.520]  The second thing, we got over the social pleasantries when you got here.
[26:36.520 --> 26:37.520]  Like, hey, buddy, how's life?
[26:37.520 --> 26:38.520]  I'm like, how are the kids?
[26:38.520 --> 26:39.520]  Yeah, I fully asked you if you voted.
[26:39.520 --> 26:40.520]  Then you're like, have you voted?
[26:40.520 --> 26:41.960]  I'm like, have you filled out your ballot yet?
[26:41.960 --> 26:42.960]  You totally got on me.
[26:42.960 --> 26:45.240]  I'm like, sorry, Mike, there's one or two I'm still thinking about.
[26:45.240 --> 26:47.200]  Dude, they word things so backwards.
[26:47.200 --> 26:51.280]  You have to Google it all just so you know you don't vote against yourself.
[26:51.280 --> 26:56.760]  One of the things I love about the mail ballot or the mail-in election is you've got your
[26:56.760 --> 26:59.580]  ballot at home for a month.
[26:59.580 --> 27:03.960]  You've got all the time in the world to sit down and go, okay, what does amendment one?
[27:03.960 --> 27:05.560]  Do I agree or not agree?
[27:05.560 --> 27:08.720]  Okay, what's amendment two?
[27:08.720 --> 27:09.840]  What does Billy Bob?
[27:10.160 --> 27:11.520]  What has he ever done for Colorado?
[27:11.520 --> 27:14.980]  Should I vote for him or should I vote for fucking Jimmy Bob?
[27:14.980 --> 27:19.300]  You can go through and check all of it and there's no rush.
[27:19.300 --> 27:22.920]  There's not some old lady in line behind you.
[27:22.920 --> 27:27.320]  You're not trying to get to work in a minute or trying to get home from work.
[27:27.320 --> 27:28.880]  You can just do it in your off time at home.
[27:28.880 --> 27:30.480]  It's so nice.
[27:30.480 --> 27:34.960]  But if you don't live in one of those states, you can look everything that's going to be
[27:34.960 --> 27:37.240]  up on your ballot online.
[27:37.240 --> 27:40.480]  You can see a picture of your ballot, how it's going to look when you get into the voting
[27:40.480 --> 27:46.400]  booth and there's nothing that says you can't take a cheat sheet that says I want to vote
[27:46.400 --> 27:51.000]  this person for governor, this person for treasurer against amendment one.
[27:51.000 --> 27:52.000]  Can you take your phone in there?
[27:52.000 --> 27:53.000]  Yeah.
[27:53.000 --> 27:54.000]  You can just write yourself a note.
[27:54.000 --> 27:55.000]  Yep.
[27:55.000 --> 27:56.000]  You can fully do it.
[27:56.000 --> 27:57.000]  Notes in your phone.
[27:57.000 --> 27:58.720]  Text yourself a note so that you have it in your phone accessible.
[27:58.720 --> 28:00.040]  We all know where the text messages are.
[28:00.040 --> 28:03.280]  You open that, read a text from yourself and it says vote for this guy for governor, this
[28:03.280 --> 28:04.280]  guy for mayor.
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.400]  When I first started doing this, like you just had to know and you'd get in there and
[28:08.400 --> 28:13.240]  you'd have the little quarter paragraph of legalese and tiny type and you had to try
[28:13.240 --> 28:14.240]  to figure it out.
[28:14.240 --> 28:15.920]  It's so much easier now.
[28:15.920 --> 28:21.600]  But I can't stress this enough.
[28:21.600 --> 28:29.160]  There's at least 30 million cannabis consumers in the US at least minimum.
[28:29.160 --> 28:33.560]  And these are a couple of times a year or more people.
[28:33.760 --> 28:39.720]  If you look at the hard data, like 20 plus million of them are more like you and me than
[28:39.720 --> 28:45.720]  they'd like to admit to their parents or authority figure like their boss.
[28:45.720 --> 28:55.560]  But we don't have any political clout anywhere until very recently.
[28:55.560 --> 28:58.640]  And it's still pretty piddly.
[28:58.640 --> 29:06.600]  When you think of a group like the NRA, like them or hate them, they run politics.
[29:06.600 --> 29:15.000]  If you come out against something they're for, you're going to face endless attack ads.
[29:15.000 --> 29:16.560]  You know it's coming.
[29:16.560 --> 29:20.600]  It's a shit show you don't want to get involved in if you're in politics.
[29:20.600 --> 29:23.480]  They've got 4 million members.
[29:23.480 --> 29:25.040]  Four.
[29:25.040 --> 29:29.680]  As in 1, 2, 3, stop counting.
[29:29.680 --> 29:37.120]  Cannabis consumers, 30 million compared to four.
[29:37.120 --> 29:45.960]  And if you look at our influence abilities, those numbers are reversed because they vote
[29:45.960 --> 29:49.160]  and they make sure everybody knows they vote.
[29:49.160 --> 29:51.160]  And they're really happy to be like, you know what I did yesterday?
[29:51.160 --> 29:52.160]  I voted.
[29:52.160 --> 29:53.160]  You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?
[29:53.280 --> 29:55.760]  I'm going to vote again in a different election when it's legal.
[29:55.760 --> 29:58.760]  I'm not double voting because that'd be bad.
[29:58.760 --> 30:00.880]  But any chance I get, I'm going to vote.
[30:00.880 --> 30:01.880]  Every election.
[30:01.880 --> 30:05.320]  Colorado does a thing now where I got it a couple of elections ago.
[30:05.320 --> 30:08.280]  I got a thing after the election that was like, seven in a row, buddy.
[30:08.280 --> 30:09.280]  Good job.
[30:09.280 --> 30:10.280]  Nice.
[30:10.280 --> 30:13.000]  And I was like, that's a nice little attaboy from our county clerk.
[30:13.000 --> 30:16.520]  Shout out to Bell.
[30:16.520 --> 30:19.260]  It's do voting's pretty easy.
[30:19.260 --> 30:22.760]  Even if you don't know anything about politics, you've never seen your ballot, you don't watch
[30:22.760 --> 30:25.080]  the commercials, you're clueless.
[30:25.080 --> 30:29.400]  If you want to vote in this election and you want to do it in a way that's not idiotic
[30:29.400 --> 30:34.040]  and you want to be a little informed about it, you're looking at half an hour with your
[30:34.040 --> 30:39.080]  smartphone from going from totally uninformed, never heard of any of these people or any
[30:39.080 --> 30:44.520]  of these issues to fully understand what I'm voting for and why I'm voting the way I'm
[30:44.520 --> 30:45.520]  voting.
[30:45.520 --> 30:46.520]  You're looking at 30 minutes tops.
[30:46.520 --> 30:48.520]  And it's worth it.
[30:48.520 --> 30:50.600]  It's very, very much worth it.
[30:50.600 --> 30:54.840]  If you're listening from prohibition land and you wonder how we got here, we got here
[30:54.840 --> 30:58.040]  because we convinced donors to vote.
[30:58.040 --> 31:02.960]  And we convinced our friends and family to vote with us by talking to them about politics
[31:02.960 --> 31:08.440]  over dinner, which was uncomfortable, just like you think it's going to be.
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.880]  But this stuff's really, really, really important.
[31:10.880 --> 31:18.520]  And the thing that drives me nuts about our community is we've gotten really close to
[31:18.520 --> 31:23.960]  federal legalization a couple of times in the not so distant past.
[31:23.960 --> 31:25.680]  We're really close in 69.
[31:25.680 --> 31:27.240]  We were close again in 71.
[31:27.240 --> 31:30.440]  We were close again in 96.
[31:30.440 --> 31:40.640]  And the community doesn't come together for anything other than a concert.
[31:40.640 --> 31:41.640]  Or a cannabis cup.
[31:41.640 --> 31:42.640]  Right.
[31:42.640 --> 31:45.160]  A party or an event.
[31:45.160 --> 31:49.720]  But if we came together even a little bit for a couple of elections in a row, we would
[31:49.720 --> 31:51.800]  run the country.
[31:51.800 --> 31:55.200]  Top to bottom, coast to coast.
[31:55.200 --> 32:01.200]  We'd be unparalleled with our ability to fundraise and message distribute.
[32:01.200 --> 32:05.920]  So how much of it is people being afraid to stand up for something that could get them
[32:05.920 --> 32:06.920]  in trouble?
[32:06.920 --> 32:12.000]  And how much of it do you think is just lack of participation because laziness or whatever
[32:12.000 --> 32:13.880]  random excuse?
[32:13.880 --> 32:16.480]  It's just, there's so many people.
[32:16.480 --> 32:24.680]  There's actually a huge chunk of politics is convincing you voting is pointless.
[32:24.680 --> 32:29.920]  If I can convince you not to vote, my vote doubles in impact.
[32:29.920 --> 32:35.080]  Every person I convince not to vote, I get their power.
[32:35.080 --> 32:40.840]  And once you convince someone not to vote, building that into a habit is super easy.
[32:40.840 --> 32:45.360]  I know a shitload of people that are like, no, one vote never changed anything.
[32:45.360 --> 32:47.200]  Or it's all rigged.
[32:47.200 --> 32:49.560]  There's only two parties.
[32:49.560 --> 32:54.480]  I still run into people that think Hillary and Trump are the same.
[32:54.480 --> 33:01.240]  And even if you don't pay attention to politics, it should be fucking obvious by now that shit
[33:01.240 --> 33:05.840]  would be different today if we had gone a different way as a country.
[33:05.840 --> 33:06.840]  But...
[33:06.840 --> 33:07.840]  Well, I'm a comedy fan.
[33:07.840 --> 33:20.320]  So it's working out pretty well for me that we've got Chito Bandito as our president.
[33:20.320 --> 33:27.640]  If we could just get even a little bit of the community focused enough to regularly
[33:27.640 --> 33:32.480]  vote and see, I'm encouraging you to vote if you're voting against me.
[33:32.480 --> 33:34.760]  I want everybody to vote.
[33:34.760 --> 33:36.440]  Just participate.
[33:36.440 --> 33:42.120]  Because right now, the people that vote are angry and afraid.
[33:42.120 --> 33:47.800]  And those two things, those two emotions don't lead to rational decision making.
[33:47.800 --> 33:50.920]  Most of the people listening are probably, they would agree with us politically, I would
[33:50.920 --> 33:51.920]  like to imagine.
[33:51.920 --> 33:52.920]  I'm not going to get involved.
[33:52.920 --> 33:54.920]  There are a lot of super conservative...
[33:54.920 --> 33:55.920]  Do your thing.
[33:55.920 --> 33:56.920]  Be on your side.
[33:56.920 --> 33:57.920]  Be full.
[33:57.920 --> 33:58.920]  Do your thing.
[33:58.920 --> 33:59.920]  Love it how you want to.
[33:59.920 --> 34:02.360]  And now that we've gone worldwide, who knows?
[34:02.360 --> 34:03.840]  But a lot of us did not vote.
[34:03.840 --> 34:05.920]  And look what happened.
[34:05.920 --> 34:12.720]  And the cannabis community not voting is why cannabis is still illegal.
[34:12.720 --> 34:19.360]  If you don't vote for local people, your local rules always get chosen by people who don't
[34:19.360 --> 34:20.600]  agree with you.
[34:20.600 --> 34:25.680]  If you don't vote for statewide elections, the statewide rules get created by people
[34:25.680 --> 34:26.800]  who don't agree with you.
[34:26.800 --> 34:30.040]  If you don't vote in national elections, it's the same shit.
[34:30.040 --> 34:36.080]  And I understand that one person in Alabama doesn't feel like their vote isn't going to
[34:36.080 --> 34:41.280]  have the same kind of impact that it would elsewhere, or it's not going to sway anything
[34:41.280 --> 34:42.920]  or change anything.
[34:42.920 --> 34:48.000]  But literally every single vote does matter and does change shit.
[34:48.000 --> 34:50.520]  That mentality seems to hover in a group.
[34:50.520 --> 34:53.040]  It'll be like the whole whatever, you know what I mean?
[34:53.040 --> 34:54.040]  It's by design.
[34:54.040 --> 34:56.040]  Jeff and his crew, none of them are going to go vote.
[34:56.040 --> 34:58.560]  They were all talking about it in school.
[34:58.560 --> 35:03.000]  One guy can convince Jeff and his crew, now you've got six people that are all like-minded
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.480]  that are going to go vote the same way.
[35:04.480 --> 35:08.080]  So that's actually six votes that you were just all going to throw away.
[35:08.080 --> 35:11.720]  So if you can convince those people that are the throwaway, I'm not going to vote.
[35:11.720 --> 35:15.040]  If you can convince the leader of that silly group, you can get a whole bunch of them to
[35:15.040 --> 35:17.400]  go all vote.
[35:17.400 --> 35:21.640]  Getting people not to vote is by design.
[35:21.800 --> 35:28.680]  And depending on where you are, the design may look a little different, but there's a
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.760]  reason there's deadlines for registering to vote.
[35:33.760 --> 35:38.080]  And for some of these, this was months, for some states, this was months ago.
[35:38.080 --> 35:41.760]  Other states you can register day of.
[35:41.760 --> 35:45.540]  Some states you need two forms of state issued ID.
[35:45.540 --> 35:48.240]  Other states you don't need any ID.
[35:48.240 --> 35:53.440]  Some states, depending on what your felony crime was, you automatically get your voting
[35:53.440 --> 35:57.080]  rights back the second your case is completed.
[35:57.080 --> 36:00.320]  You don't get to vote for the five years where you're on parole or the three years you're
[36:00.320 --> 36:01.400]  incarcerated.
[36:01.400 --> 36:05.440]  But once all that's done and you're just a regular free person who did some time and
[36:05.440 --> 36:08.680]  is now a free-free, you get your voting rights back.
[36:08.680 --> 36:12.560]  In other states, you never get them back at all, or you have to go through a long insane
[36:12.560 --> 36:20.040]  process or a long insane process that is also 100% arbitrary.
[36:20.040 --> 36:25.300]  If you don't watch last week tonight with John Oliver listeners, you should.
[36:25.300 --> 36:30.520]  He did a great episode on some of this voting rights stuff not too long ago.
[36:30.520 --> 36:37.920]  But if the fact that there are people spending millions of dollars to convince you not to
[36:37.920 --> 36:44.800]  vote because you're young and you like cannabis, doesn't that make you want to go vote?
[36:44.800 --> 36:52.040]  They're spending fortunes to convince poor people and minorities.
[36:52.040 --> 36:57.400]  If you're a member of anything that can be considered a subculture, they don't want you
[36:57.400 --> 37:01.480]  to vote because the odds are you're going to vote in your interests and not theirs,
[37:01.480 --> 37:04.200]  and they don't want that.
[37:04.200 --> 37:07.560]  This messaging has been so effective in different communities.
[37:08.200 --> 37:10.280]  The cannabis community got hit hard with it.
[37:10.280 --> 37:17.600]  And the tune-in dropout or whatever fucking message-
[37:17.600 --> 37:18.600]  Yeah, tune-in turn-on dropout.
[37:18.600 --> 37:19.600]  Yeah.
[37:19.600 --> 37:20.600]  Dead-end culture.
[37:20.600 --> 37:25.120]  That got taken way too far.
[37:25.120 --> 37:31.160]  Even people that are more like me than you took a part of that to heart.
[37:31.160 --> 37:34.520]  I remember a part of that, of fighting it when I was in college.
[37:34.520 --> 37:37.720]  I know that I should vote and voting is important and I should pay attention to politics, but
[37:37.720 --> 37:38.720]  fuck you.
[37:38.720 --> 37:40.480]  I don't want to be any part of the system.
[37:40.480 --> 37:42.840]  When I was younger, I thought it was stupid.
[37:42.840 --> 37:44.280]  I thought it was a waste of time to go vote.
[37:44.280 --> 37:47.880]  My friends would go vote and they'd come back from school or from lunch and they'd have
[37:47.880 --> 37:50.040]  that I voted sticker and they'd be like, hey, you wasted your lunch.
[37:50.040 --> 37:52.560]  I drove around and fucking smoked bowls in the car.
[37:52.560 --> 37:54.640]  I thought it was just a dumb thing.
[37:54.640 --> 38:00.880]  Now that I am old enough to see the effects that the elections have, either small or large
[38:00.880 --> 38:06.120]  local or national, I feel like I may have wasted a lot of opportunity by not voting
[38:06.120 --> 38:07.120]  when I was younger.
[38:07.120 --> 38:09.640]  There were probably several years of my life that I skipped voting.
[38:09.640 --> 38:12.920]  There were a number of important elections where we could use your vote, bro.
[38:12.920 --> 38:13.920]  Yeah, probably.
[38:13.920 --> 38:18.680]  But none of this has to stay true.
[38:18.680 --> 38:25.160]  This November 7th, we could see massive cannabis turnout.
[38:25.160 --> 38:31.080]  We have seen that across the country during recent elections where one side or the other
[38:31.080 --> 38:37.760]  really goes for the cannabis vote, knowing that it's going to bring out young, more than
[38:37.760 --> 38:40.080]  likely liberal voters.
[38:40.080 --> 38:41.280]  It's worked for some places.
[38:41.280 --> 38:44.600]  It hasn't worked in others.
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.920]  Like Pueblo County, the last election in 2016 when we elected Trump, we went for keeping
[38:49.920 --> 38:53.200]  the marijuana industry and for Trump.
[38:53.240 --> 38:59.720]  There were a bunch of places around the country that went for Trump and for cannabis.
[38:59.720 --> 39:03.880]  Watching the pundits the day after the election, like, so we don't know what the fuck happened,
[39:03.880 --> 39:06.600]  but this is the results.
[39:06.600 --> 39:10.800]  It was fun to watch, but at the same time, a little bit terrifying.
[39:10.800 --> 39:13.360]  This election kind of has the same feel to it.
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.720]  There's a lot of important shit on the ballot right now.
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.000]  North Dakota and I think Michigan are both voting on legalization.
[39:21.000 --> 39:24.640]  I haven't seen much from the pro-legalization campaigns in those states.
[39:24.640 --> 39:30.520]  I've seen a lot from the anti-cannabis legalization groups in those states.
[39:30.520 --> 39:40.360]  Part of that's who I follow, not the messaging on the ground, but that's just two states
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.200]  and there's at least 10 voting on cannabis right now.
[39:44.200 --> 39:51.280]  Colorado's got a hemp amendment, which is kind of sketchy.
[39:51.280 --> 39:55.120]  I definitely encourage people who haven't already voted in Colorado to really look at
[39:55.120 --> 40:00.560]  amendment X before choosing yes or no.
[40:00.560 --> 40:05.800]  There's a lot of important shit on your ballot, not just marijuana stuff.
[40:05.800 --> 40:06.800]  Politicians too.
[40:06.800 --> 40:10.840]  I received, and I want to actually give a shout out to a politician for the first time
[40:10.840 --> 40:13.600]  ever on this show.
[40:13.600 --> 40:21.040]  And this isn't quite an endorsement, although cannabis community, the candidate I'm about
[40:21.040 --> 40:27.240]  to mention is very pro-cannabis and his opponent is very anti-cannabis.
[40:27.240 --> 40:33.120]  But Jared Polis of Colorado, who's currently a senator and running for governor, I got
[40:33.120 --> 40:36.600]  a mailer two days ago.
[40:36.600 --> 40:38.880]  One side of it is just a pretty nug.
[40:39.360 --> 40:45.040]  It needed to be trimmed, but it was just a nice nug on a high gloss print, just right
[40:45.040 --> 40:46.040]  out of fucking high times.
[40:46.040 --> 40:47.040]  The fat bud of weed needs to be trimmed.
[40:47.040 --> 40:49.800]  Just one fat bud that needed some sizzle-up.
[40:49.800 --> 40:50.800]  That's pretty cool.
[40:50.800 --> 40:55.920]  And on the other side, it outlined his pro-cannabis stance and views for the state.
[40:55.920 --> 40:57.760]  I apologize if you guys can hear the dab torch.
[40:57.760 --> 41:00.760]  I'm heating up the nail for Mike to hit the CBD dab I've got for him.
[41:00.760 --> 41:01.760]  It does.
[41:01.760 --> 41:02.760]  And then we're going to start wrapping up.
[41:02.760 --> 41:04.080]  Man, I'm fucking 36.
[41:04.080 --> 41:11.920]  I never thought I'd see that where a serious candidate for governor, not a fringe candidate,
[41:11.920 --> 41:18.040]  not a Green Party candidate, but one of the two who was going to get it would put out
[41:18.040 --> 41:20.160]  something that pro-cannabis.
[41:20.160 --> 41:24.240]  Blatantly, explicitly pro-cannabis.
[41:24.240 --> 41:27.280]  I mean, he was pretty pro-cannabis for his last Senate run.
[41:27.280 --> 41:29.740]  I never saw anything like this.
[41:29.740 --> 41:30.740]  Even a little bit.
[41:30.740 --> 41:31.740]  That was a big flame.
[41:31.740 --> 41:32.740]  Wow.
[41:33.400 --> 41:36.820]  Yeah, this is your friendly reminder that smoke burns, ladies and gentlemen.
[41:36.820 --> 41:37.820]  Smoke will burn.
[41:37.820 --> 41:38.820]  Whoa, what?
[41:38.820 --> 41:39.820]  Smoke will burn.
[41:39.820 --> 41:45.780]  That was the leftover oil in that nail from not burning the dab last time from it being
[41:45.780 --> 41:46.780]  a little bit too cool.
[41:46.780 --> 41:49.460]  Sorry, I'll speak into the microphone like a damn podcaster here.
[41:49.460 --> 41:53.620]  Mike likes, sorry listeners, for those of you who aren't psychic and didn't see what
[41:53.620 --> 42:00.020]  we just saw, Jeff's heating the dab nail and my weak lungs took a cool dab last time and
[42:00.020 --> 42:01.580]  left some residue in the banger.
[42:01.740 --> 42:02.740]  Banger?
[42:02.740 --> 42:03.740]  I'm going to grab the other torch.
[42:03.740 --> 42:04.740]  You keep talking.
[42:04.740 --> 42:05.740]  It's within reach.
[42:05.740 --> 42:08.260]  While Jeff was heating it up, it produced a little cloud of smoke.
[42:08.260 --> 42:13.340]  When he moved that torch up a little bit, the flame hit the smoke and produced the fireball
[42:13.340 --> 42:17.780]  the size of his dreadnought.
[42:17.780 --> 42:20.620]  Smoke does burn, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:20.620 --> 42:24.140]  There's also a friendly reminder to keep a spare dab torch or an extra can of tannin
[42:24.140 --> 42:25.780]  around whenever you're dabbing.
[42:25.780 --> 42:28.380]  You never know when a torch is going to die.
[42:28.380 --> 42:29.740]  That torch just quit lighting on me.
[42:29.740 --> 42:32.500]  I was bragging on it the other day saying how good it is and it just took a poo-poo
[42:32.500 --> 42:34.460]  so we got to use the backup plan.
[42:34.460 --> 42:37.300]  I made that mistake with the wife the other night.
[42:37.300 --> 42:39.300]  I told her, man, it's been three nights in a row.
[42:39.300 --> 42:41.180]  One of the kids has slept all the way through.
[42:41.180 --> 42:42.340]  Oh yeah, you sure shit.
[42:42.340 --> 42:44.460]  Homie was up twice that night.
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.780]  Probably within five minutes of you saying that, that's just the way it goes.
[42:46.780 --> 42:50.460]  It was like an hour and a half after I said it and then again at 530 in the morning.
[42:50.460 --> 42:55.260]  All right, Mike, when this nail is hot, you've got about 50 seconds to give us your final
[42:55.260 --> 42:56.260]  thoughts.
[42:56.260 --> 43:00.060]  If you've got anything else to say, if you've got anything else for the podcast, now's your
[43:00.060 --> 43:01.900]  chance to get a vote.
[43:01.900 --> 43:06.020]  If you, if you don't get a chance to vote this election, you should feel like a piece
[43:06.020 --> 43:11.660]  of shit for like at least three hours and then you can let that go.
[43:11.660 --> 43:12.740]  But get registered to vote.
[43:12.740 --> 43:15.780]  If you're not registered to vote, it's super simple to do.
[43:15.780 --> 43:16.780]  Google it.
[43:16.780 --> 43:18.540]  You can probably do it online.
[43:18.540 --> 43:24.660]  If not a 15 minute visit to the GMV in your area, you'll get it cleared up in most places
[43:24.660 --> 43:25.660]  unless you're black and in the South.
[43:25.660 --> 43:26.660]  Bro, should I edit that out?
[43:26.660 --> 43:27.660]  No, that's true.
[43:27.660 --> 43:28.660]  Okay.
[43:28.660 --> 43:32.820]  Um, there are huge portions of the country that make it super hard for different groups
[43:32.820 --> 43:33.820]  to vote.
[43:33.820 --> 43:34.820]  Yeah, that's true.
[43:34.820 --> 43:37.500]  I don't at all mind somebody coming to me in five years being like, do you remember
[43:37.500 --> 43:39.660]  when you said it was hard for black people to vote in Alabama?
[43:39.660 --> 43:41.460]  No, it's just true.
[43:41.460 --> 43:43.460]  It's a fucking thing.
[43:43.460 --> 43:48.260]  Um, yeah, if you feel like yelling at me for that, it's at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter.
[43:48.260 --> 43:49.260]  Oh, that's cool.
[43:49.260 --> 43:52.020]  That's going to be one of the next things I was going to say.
[43:52.020 --> 43:53.020]  Mike's going to take a dab.
[43:53.020 --> 43:55.020]  Make sure you follow Mike on all the social media.
[43:55.020 --> 43:59.260]  He is Pueblo for sensible cannabis, cannabis laws, not cannibal laws, Pueblo for sensible
[43:59.260 --> 44:00.260]  cannabis laws.
[44:00.260 --> 44:02.620]  That's a big difference than cannibal laws.
[44:02.620 --> 44:03.620]  Important distinction.
[44:03.620 --> 44:05.700]  Two different, totally different groups.
[44:05.700 --> 44:06.700]  Don't follow that.
[44:06.700 --> 44:07.700]  This is delicious.
[44:07.700 --> 44:09.280]  That's a mostly CBD.
[44:09.280 --> 44:10.280]  Don't follow the cannibal.
[44:10.280 --> 44:11.700]  Well you do, do follow the cannibal group.
[44:11.700 --> 44:12.700]  If that's your thing.
[44:12.700 --> 44:13.700]  I'm trying not to be judgmental.
[44:13.700 --> 44:15.380]  I'm trying to embrace everybody.
[44:15.380 --> 44:19.540]  I don't think there's a Pueblo for sensible cannibal laws, but I'm kind of wanting to
[44:19.540 --> 44:20.540]  start it now.
[44:20.540 --> 44:21.700]  That would be a fun troll.
[44:21.700 --> 44:25.220]  But anyway, support Mike's Facebook group, Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[44:25.220 --> 44:27.380]  It's much more appetizing.
[44:27.380 --> 44:29.180]  It's not as awkward to follow.
[44:29.180 --> 44:30.180]  Also follow him.
[44:30.180 --> 44:32.340]  I'm going to leave his mic on so you can hear him cough over there.
[44:32.340 --> 44:33.380]  Follow him on the Twitter.
[44:33.380 --> 44:35.340]  He is at Nemo punk 15.
[44:35.340 --> 44:38.300]  He is getting cross-eyed and small tears.
[44:38.300 --> 44:41.300]  I can't focus them.
[44:41.300 --> 44:43.300]  I can't focus them and did a little eye movements.
[44:43.300 --> 44:44.300]  He did superstar eyes.
[44:44.300 --> 44:45.300]  Hey Mike, thanks for hanging out.
[44:45.300 --> 44:46.300]  I forgot we were recording there for half a second.
[44:46.300 --> 44:47.300]  That was a good dab.
[44:47.300 --> 44:48.300]  You've got headphones and a microphone.
[44:48.300 --> 44:49.300]  Oh man, that CBD.
[44:50.300 --> 44:51.300]  Cherry flavor is just phenomenal.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.300]  I'm glad I thought of giving you a dab of that.
[44:52.300 --> 44:53.300]  Oh, you guys, listeners, thank you for listening this long.
[44:53.300 --> 44:54.300]  We really appreciate it.
[44:54.300 --> 44:55.300]  Yes.
[44:55.300 --> 44:56.300]  Thanks for hanging out.
[44:56.300 --> 44:57.300]  It's been 45 minutes.
[44:57.300 --> 44:58.300]  If you're still listening, we totally appreciate it.
[44:58.300 --> 44:59.300]  Hashtag they like it when we ramble and it'll be a couple of days before I can get back
[44:59.300 --> 45:00.300]  over here again.
[45:00.300 --> 45:01.300]  So there's definitely more grow lessons coming after this episode.
[45:01.300 --> 45:02.300]  Yeah, we're going to put a lot of grow lessons up.
[45:02.300 --> 45:03.300]  If you guys have been following the show, I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[45:03.300 --> 45:04.300]  Thanks for hanging out.
[45:04.300 --> 45:05.300]  We'll see you next time.
[45:05.300 --> 45:06.300]  Bye.
[45:06.300 --> 45:07.300]  Bye.
[45:07.300 --> 45:08.300]  Bye.
[45:08.300 --> 45:09.300]  Bye.
[45:09.300 --> 45:10.300]  Bye.
[45:10.300 --> 45:11.300]  Bye.
[45:11.300 --> 45:12.300]  Bye.
[45:12.300 --> 45:13.300]  Bye.
[45:13.300 --> 45:14.300]  Bye.
[45:14.300 --> 45:15.300]  Bye.
[45:15.300 --> 45:16.300]  Bye.
[45:17.140 --> 45:19.220]  a long series of grow lessons.
[45:19.220 --> 45:20.580]  Thanks for letting me take a break on those.
[45:20.580 --> 45:21.980]  Thanks for let my hang out for a minute.
[45:21.980 --> 45:24.060]  The lessons we'll be back on the next episode.
[45:24.060 --> 45:29.560]  I know I've made promises and set expectations and I will meet those expectations for you.
[45:29.560 --> 45:31.100]  Thanks for listening, you guys.
[45:31.100 --> 45:33.420]  I think that's pretty much what we've got.
[45:33.420 --> 45:35.280]  The hemp farm was cool.
[45:35.280 --> 45:40.820]  The only difference between hemp and cannabis basically in Colorado is a lab test.
[45:40.820 --> 45:43.680]  Hemp CBD is CBD that works with it.
[45:43.680 --> 45:45.800]  Acting like quit, poopoo-ing hemp CBD.
[45:45.800 --> 45:49.320]  It's great medicine for people who are in need. It's affordable and it's reliable.
[45:50.760 --> 45:54.040]  Vote, get off your ass and vote. Even if you're going to vote against us,
[45:54.040 --> 45:56.680]  participate. Just get out there and do it. Practice.
[45:56.680 --> 45:58.760]  It's so important that everybody votes.
[45:58.760 --> 45:59.400]  Yeah, just vote.
[45:59.400 --> 46:01.080]  It's ridiculously important.
[46:01.080 --> 46:03.240]  I think that's all we got for today, Mike. Is that it?
[46:04.120 --> 46:04.760]  That's it.
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.240]  All right. I would appreciate it if you find me on the social media. You can find the podcast,
