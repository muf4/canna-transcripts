[00:42.280 --> 00:45.760]  guys are listening to this, I'm probably running around at the cannabis cup, getting a sunburn,
[00:45.760 --> 00:49.280]  getting dabbed out, shaking hands, rubbing elbows. Hope a lot of you guys made it out
[00:49.280 --> 00:53.920]  to the cup. I hope you had a safe 420. Hope you had a happy 420. Hope everything went
[00:53.920 --> 00:58.320]  your way. I hope you smoked on some delicious dank. We've got a couple of news articles
[00:58.320 --> 01:02.000]  I want to read. I want to talk about a letter that somebody sent me. I want to talk about
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.400]  a letter that the MED has sent out to businesses in Colorado regarding the cannabis cup. But
[01:08.400 --> 01:12.320]  before we get that far, I do need to pay a couple of bills. This podcast is brought to

[02:38.440 --> 02:42.040]  All right. I'm going to turn down some music here and we're going to get into a couple
[02:42.040 --> 02:48.200]  of things. The first thing I want to talk about is Hitman Dougie posted a thing to Instagram
[02:48.200 --> 02:53.640]  is where I discovered this. He, it's a two page letter. Sorry, I'm pulling up the article
[02:53.640 --> 02:59.280]  while I talk here. It's a two page letter. It was sent to all of the, I'm going to say
[02:59.280 --> 03:04.280]  MED a lot here. The MED stands for marijuana enforcement division. So the marijuana enforcement
[03:04.280 --> 03:09.560]  division sent this letter to every business in Colorado that is regulated and registered
[03:09.560 --> 03:16.520]  with the marijuana enforcement division, which includes every dispensary, every edible manufacturing
[03:16.520 --> 03:22.280]  company, every extract making company, just about anything involved in the marijuana industry
[03:22.280 --> 03:26.460]  is covered, covered by these guys. Everything is, if you're doing it legally, these guys
[03:26.460 --> 03:33.660]  are in your shit. So they sent out a letter regarding the cannabis cup to remind the businesses.
[03:33.660 --> 03:38.340]  I'm going to just kind of read it. It says regarding a licensee participation in off-premise
[03:38.340 --> 03:44.260]  cannabis events, trade shows, and festivals. The letter says this dear Colorado marijuana
[03:44.260 --> 03:49.020]  industry members as the operator of a medical marijuana business and or retail marijuana
[03:49.020 --> 03:53.300]  establishment, you hold a privileged license issued by the state licensing authority. Your
[03:53.300 --> 03:58.740]  facility must be operated strictly within the law set forth by the Colorado constitution,
[03:58.740 --> 04:03.100]  Colorado revised statutes, and the Colorado code of regulations. The marijuana enforcement
[04:03.100 --> 04:07.900]  division, which is the MED is responsible for ensuring licensees fully comply with these
[04:07.900 --> 04:13.980]  laws while licensees may be aware of the legal requirements on the license premises, high-profile
[04:13.980 --> 04:18.740]  cannabis events, trade shows, industry marketing, and festivals around the state generate a
[04:18.740 --> 04:24.500]  number of inquiries to MED about what business or establishment related activity may be permissible
[04:24.500 --> 04:30.740]  off the license premise. Typically those inquiries focus on whether an owner or their employee
[04:30.740 --> 04:35.500]  may transport medical marijuana or retail marijuana, flour or products from licensed
[04:35.500 --> 04:40.620]  premises to such events for marketing and promotional purposes for display, providing
[04:40.620 --> 04:46.580]  samples competitions, sales or donations, et cetera. Statute clearly mandates that marijuana
[04:46.580 --> 04:50.900]  produced within regulated system must remain in the closed system and only transported
[04:50.900 --> 04:57.300]  between MED license premises until final sale to a patient or customer and may not be consumed
[04:57.300 --> 05:03.400]  within any licensed premises. No owner or employee may enjoy the privileges provided
[05:03.400 --> 05:09.020]  by MED business license, the ability to lawfully cultivate process and sell marijuana within
[05:09.020 --> 05:14.980]  the state of Colorado at any off premise site. Medical or retail marijuana licensee owners
[05:14.980 --> 05:20.100]  or employees should not use personally purchased flour or product as a means to avoid the intent
[05:20.100 --> 05:25.300]  of the statute and regulation prohibiting off premise display and sale of marijuana.
[05:25.300 --> 05:30.820]  Colorado statute and rule does not preclude a MED licensee from participating at an event,
[05:30.820 --> 05:36.100]  trade show or festival off premises in order to distribute coupons, display graphics or
[05:36.100 --> 05:39.520]  handout printed material. All right, this is a two page article. I have to click back
[05:39.520 --> 05:44.020]  a couple pages to find page two because I just found this on Hitman Glass Dougie's Instagram.
[05:44.020 --> 05:47.840]  So I'm reading a picture of this letter, honestly. But I want to recap kind of what
[05:47.840 --> 05:53.340]  part of this says. They're saying basically that, oh, that music's still playing. There
[05:53.340 --> 05:59.340]  we go. They're saying that you can't take your cannabis that was produced in a dispensary
[05:59.340 --> 06:04.860]  grow to these events and share it, smoke it, consume it and show it off at these events.
[06:04.860 --> 06:12.420]  It has to stay in the confines of that regulated building. So they can't take that cannabis
[06:12.420 --> 06:18.020]  which means the dispensaries, the large dispensaries that have paid a lot of money for booths cannot
[06:18.020 --> 06:24.540]  go display their product. Typically these booths would be smoking you down with dabs.
[06:24.540 --> 06:28.420]  They'd be smoking you down with flowers. There would be a line. You would get to taste all
[06:28.420 --> 06:35.020]  of the major dispensaries in Colorado's products. Now the MED is saying, no, you cannot do that.
[06:35.020 --> 06:38.980]  They have also said that they're going to be there in force to enforce this to make
[06:38.980 --> 06:42.580]  sure this happens. That's not in this letter. That's just the talk around this letter. They
[06:42.580 --> 06:46.860]  have verified, yes, we're not fucking around. We're coming to kind of put some pressure
[06:46.860 --> 06:51.340]  on you. Then there's that short paragraph, medical or retail marijuana licensee, owners
[06:51.340 --> 06:55.760]  or employees should not use personally purchased flower or products as a mean to avoid the
[06:55.760 --> 07:01.060]  intent of the statute and regulation prohibiting off premises display and sale of marijuana.
[07:01.060 --> 07:04.780]  Now that sounds like a lot of weirdness. If you don't catch on to what that says, that
[07:04.780 --> 07:11.140]  means that if a dispensary owner knows a private grower, like myself, I'm a private
[07:11.140 --> 07:16.500]  grower. I have a private caregiver grow. He cannot buy a pound of product from me and
[07:16.500 --> 07:22.980]  put it in his dispensary display at the cannabis cup. He cannot do that. Should not use personally
[07:22.980 --> 07:28.540]  purchased flower or product as a means to avoid the intent. So if they find product
[07:28.540 --> 07:34.420]  there, they're going to be upset about it. You're going to be in violation some way because
[07:34.420 --> 07:39.540]  you're violating either the transportation law and taking it out of the closed system
[07:39.540 --> 07:43.860]  that they have invented here, or you're going to be in violation because you have now purchased
[07:43.860 --> 07:47.780]  some outside system cannabis and brought it into the system. So they're definitely going
[07:47.780 --> 07:50.820]  to find a way to screw us. Let me find page two. That's what I'm kind of stumbling into
[07:50.820 --> 07:54.820]  here. There we go. All right. Oh, there was another paragraph on the end of page one that
[07:54.820 --> 08:02.420]  I have to start with. Let's find that it says, but in order to diminish the potential for
[08:02.420 --> 08:07.060]  improper conduct at an event or a festival, Colorado licensees are strongly encouraged
[08:07.060 --> 08:13.500]  to locate any booth or exhibit table in an area away from separated. Oh, in an area away
[08:13.500 --> 08:19.380]  from and separated from any area designated for consumption of marijuana. Similarly, licensees
[08:19.380 --> 08:24.740]  are encouraged to avoid any participation in which the licensee might appear to be facilitating
[08:24.740 --> 08:29.140]  potentially illegal conduct. So they know that there's going to be consumption at some
[08:29.140 --> 08:34.100]  of these events. And they're saying that they want you, if you are an MED regulated
[08:34.100 --> 08:39.820]  business, you need to be locate any booth or exhibit table in any area away from and
[08:39.820 --> 08:45.060]  separated from any area designated for consumption. So they're pretty much saying get the fuck
[08:45.060 --> 08:50.860]  away from all the cannabis stuff where people are smoking, go far, far away from that. The
[08:50.860 --> 08:56.060]  last I heard High Times canceled the medical portion of their party at the Cannabis Cup
[08:56.060 --> 09:00.620]  this year because they're putting this pressure on it and they can't get they couldn't get
[09:00.620 --> 09:03.940]  enough medical entries is what somebody told me is why they were doing it. This kind of
[09:03.940 --> 09:08.980]  makes sense now. What they used to do was they would have a special building designated
[09:08.980 --> 09:12.300]  just for the medical entries. And it doesn't seem like they're doing that now. But I'm
[09:12.300 --> 09:19.620]  gonna keep reading this a pursuant to CRS 12 dash 43.3 dash 901. Do you guys really
[09:19.620 --> 09:22.260]  want to hear all these numbers? I'm going to skip that. It is unlawful for a person
[09:22.260 --> 09:26.540]  to buy sell, transfer, give away or acquire medical marijuana, retail marijuana or retail
[09:26.540 --> 09:32.580]  marijuana products except as allowed pursuant to these articles or section 16 of article
[09:32.580 --> 09:37.440]  Roman numerals of the state constitution. Sorry, I'm trying to get past that part quickly.
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.620]  Conduct outside of the protections of the license and regulated market under CRS Title
[09:41.620 --> 09:47.100]  12 or authorized under amendments 20 or 64 may trigger criminal liability under CRS Title
[09:47.100 --> 09:53.980]  18 to include unlawful dispensing sale and distribution of marijuana or marijuana concentrate,
[09:53.980 --> 10:00.380]  which means if you're there giving away cannabis as a booth, they can arrest you for unlawful
[10:00.380 --> 10:06.420]  distribution of marijuana or marijuana concentrate. And then it continues to say the MED will
[10:06.420 --> 10:10.380]  continue to work with Colorado licensees to promote a strong and legitimate legitimate
[10:10.380 --> 10:15.240]  regulatory framework for the Colorado marijuana industry. MED will hold both businesses and
[10:15.240 --> 10:20.600]  individual marijuana licensees responsible for violations of state statutes and regulations.
[10:20.600 --> 10:24.680]  Failure to abide by the state, the statutes and regulations may result in a range of sanctions
[10:24.680 --> 10:30.080]  up to including the suspension and revocation of marijuana business or occupational licenses
[10:30.080 --> 10:35.080]  in addition to possible criminal charges and penalties. So what they're saying there is
[10:35.080 --> 10:41.040]  everybody that works in an MED regulated facility has to have an MED badge, which mine should
[10:41.040 --> 10:44.160]  be sitting on the table there. There it is. It's a little green badge. It's got your picture
[10:44.160 --> 10:47.960]  on it. It's got your name on it. And it says marijuana enforcement division. And then there
[10:47.960 --> 10:53.160]  are three different colors. There are support badges, which are usually the trimmers, the
[10:53.160 --> 10:59.080]  bud tenders and stuff. And then there are key badges, which are people that make decisions
[10:59.080 --> 11:06.940]  is basically how that goes. Managers, master growers, lead growers, those guys are your
[11:06.940 --> 11:11.600]  key holder badges. And then above that is the owner badge. And those are bright red.
[11:11.600 --> 11:16.160]  You only see those very rarely, but they're saying that if you get caught doing something
[11:16.160 --> 11:20.880]  stupid at this event, they will revoke not only the business license, but they're going
[11:20.880 --> 11:27.040]  to take away the employee MED badge license, which is kind of sketchy too. So guys, if
[11:27.040 --> 11:30.120]  you're out there supporting a dispenser, you got big balls and I got a lot of respect for
[11:30.120 --> 11:34.560]  you. Be careful. Don't lose your business license. Then the letter ends with you. If
[11:34.560 --> 11:39.720]  you have any questions or suggestions, please contact investigator, Victor Ross field enforcement
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.600]  section, Denver office at, and then they give his email address and his phone number.
[11:43.600 --> 11:47.220]  Thanks for your understanding, support and cooperation. And then it looks like a three-year-old
[11:47.220 --> 11:54.240]  signed the letter. So apparently they're serious about this. They're not messing around. And
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.780]  then Hitman Glass, Dougie, shout out to Dougie. If you don't know Dougie from Hitman Glass,
[11:58.780 --> 12:01.760]  say what's up to him at the cannabis cup, give him a high five. I might put this episode
[12:01.760 --> 12:05.920]  out a couple of days early, just so that you can hear this before the cup. This is cup
[12:05.920 --> 12:12.440]  day here, but happy for 20. Anyway. Dougie raises the question in Colorado here, their
[12:12.440 --> 12:19.140]  goal was to regulate alcohol or regulate cannabis like alcohol. Now this does not seem like
[12:19.140 --> 12:23.840]  the fair way to do it, right? Because when you go to any event in Colorado, you see cores
[12:23.840 --> 12:27.880]  everywhere. You see Budweiser it's course everywhere because we've got a lot of cores
[12:27.880 --> 12:32.260]  breweries here, but you see cores, you see bud, you see fat tire. You see so many beer
[12:32.260 --> 12:36.900]  ads everywhere you go in Colorado. And if you go to like the food festivals, if you
[12:36.900 --> 12:43.100]  go to a football game, a baseball game, there are beer ads. Now what's wrong with having
[12:43.100 --> 12:47.980]  cannabis people, cannabis businesses at cannabis events. If we're going to go do beer events
[12:47.980 --> 12:52.420]  where we serve beer everywhere, it's just unfair. I think it's hypocritical. It's not
[12:52.420 --> 12:57.260]  what we asked for. It's not what we voted for. We need to find a way. The big flaw in
[12:57.260 --> 13:01.160]  all the Colorado laws, in my opinion, is that we can buy cannabis. We can grow cannabis.
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.360]  We can possess cannabis. We can have cannabis, but the only place you're really allowed to
[13:05.360 --> 13:11.220]  consume cannabis is in your own home. That's the only legal place in the privacy or another
[13:11.220 --> 13:16.560]  person's home or in a private place. And we've tried to have events that we've called private,
[13:16.560 --> 13:20.080]  but then once the cops show up, they call it public and we can't have our dab events
[13:20.080 --> 13:24.560]  or smoke outs there anymore. So that's the flaw in our law is having somewhere legal
[13:24.560 --> 13:28.760]  to smoke and being able to have these booths come and bring their wares and advertise heavily.
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.040]  It sucks that they're tracking down. This year could set a precedent for how the cups
[13:34.040 --> 13:38.800]  are going to go in the future. They may change things. I hope it goes well. Guys, if you're
[13:38.800 --> 13:41.600]  going to the cannabis cup, be safe. I'm going to put this episode out a couple of days early
[13:41.600 --> 13:45.720]  is what I feel like I need to do so that you guys can hear this, but please be safe. Please
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.480]  be safe at the cup. Also, if you're at the cup, find me, dude. I'm a six foot five white
[13:50.480 --> 13:57.640]  guy. I've got dreadlocks to my ass region, past my ass, thigh region. I'm wearing an
[13:57.640 --> 14:02.360]  iRegenetics t-shirt or hoodie. Most likely I've got a grassroots hat on. It's crooked.
[14:02.360 --> 14:08.320]  I'm easy to find it. I'm a smiley white guy. I'm goofy. Yeah. Anyway, find me. Say what's
[14:08.320 --> 14:12.560]  up to me at the cannabis cup. Let's talk about the four 20 weekend. Let's see. What am I
[14:12.560 --> 14:15.520]  going to do? Where can you guys find me? If you guys want to hang out, take a dab. If
[14:15.520 --> 14:19.800]  you want to smoke a joint with me, smoke a bowl with me. Let's see. Wednesday night,
[14:19.800 --> 14:25.720]  the 15th, I will be at Cervantes in Denver, checking out a band called Morgan heritage.
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.800]  Probably one of my favorite reggae bands. I live 125 miles from that concert. I'm going
[14:30.800 --> 14:38.200]  by myself. If you want to dab me out before hit me up, email me, Facebook me, Instagram
[14:38.200 --> 14:46.320]  me something. It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com. GFYH, add GFYH podcast on Twitter. You can
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.040]  just find grow from your heart on Facebook, but seriously, I'm down to dab with you or
[14:50.040 --> 14:53.360]  something. I'll have some time to kill. I'll go up there early. If you're somewhere near
[14:53.360 --> 14:57.680]  Cervantes, I'm not sure which Cervantes. There are several Cervantes venues. I got
[14:57.680 --> 15:00.840]  to look at my ticket and see which one it is, but if you're somewhere near one of the
[15:00.840 --> 15:06.960]  Cervantes and want to dab me out on Wednesday, I'm all about that. Thursday, I'll be up in
[15:06.960 --> 15:13.480]  Colorado Springs seeing hydro. My friend hydro performs some pretty dope ass hip hop rap
[15:13.480 --> 15:17.680]  style stuff. Really positive dude. I like that guy a lot. I'm going to go dab him out
[15:17.680 --> 15:23.280]  in Colorado Springs on Thursday. Friday, I'm packing up, taking care of the plants
[15:23.280 --> 15:28.120]  real good, getting them all happy, making sure everything at home is cool. Then Friday
[15:28.120 --> 15:31.840]  night, heading up to Denver for the Cannabis Cup. Got to go get in my hotel room Friday
[15:31.840 --> 15:35.880]  night. Once again, if you're in Denver Friday night, you want to take some dabs, let me
[15:35.880 --> 15:39.560]  know. We will get down on all of that. You know what? I think this episode is going to
[15:39.560 --> 15:42.640]  have to come out like Wednesday or something, and then we'll just do another episode for
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.200]  420. That's what I think we'll do. I told you Wednesday. I told you Thursday. Friday,
[15:47.200 --> 15:51.400]  I'm packing up, heading up to the cup. Saturday, I'm getting up early and heading to the Cannabis
[15:51.400 --> 15:55.760]  Cup as soon as I wake up. Just going to take a shower, get some food, go to the cup, and
[15:55.760 --> 15:59.840]  rage it up. Saturday night, I don't have any plans at the Cannabis Cup or after the cup.
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.560]  If you got something going on Saturday night, send me a message. We'll get it on. Sunday,
[16:04.560 --> 16:08.920]  same deal. I want to get up, head to the Cannabis Cup, go have fun, go see all my friends. I
[16:08.920 --> 16:13.520]  want to shake your hand. I want to shake everybody's hand. Find me there Sunday. Monday is going
[16:13.520 --> 16:17.080]  to be a big day. Monday, I might get to the cup a little bit late. I might sleep in a
[16:17.080 --> 16:23.040]  little bit because I've got a long night. It'll be Cannabis Cup. Then at 9.45, I've
[16:23.040 --> 16:28.560]  got VIP tickets to see Doug Benson record a new comedy special at Comedy Works. I will
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.040]  definitely be there a little bit early. There's usually a smokeout with Doug before or after
[16:33.040 --> 16:36.820]  the show. I can't tell you if that'll happen publicly or privately, but I will definitely
[16:36.820 --> 16:41.880]  get Doug nice and blazed for his recording. After Doug Benson, depending on how late it
[16:41.880 --> 16:47.360]  is and how I'm feeling, I might venture over to Cervantes or maybe it's Coyotes. I don't
[16:47.360 --> 16:51.440]  know. I'll find out for sure by the time the show comes. Lee Scratch Perry with special
[16:51.440 --> 16:55.960]  guests will be at a club in Denver. If I've got the energy, I'm going to head over to
[16:55.960 --> 17:00.200]  that and see what's going on and check out some more reggae. Then I'm going to drive
[17:00.200 --> 17:05.720]  home. I got to drive 125, 130-ish miles, about two hours back home, take care of the garden,
[17:05.720 --> 17:09.840]  make sure nothing went crazy at a couple of spots. I got to check on some plants on Tuesday.
[17:10.400 --> 17:14.560]  Tuesday, I think I'm heading back up to Denver, have lunch with somebody. Then I got to come back
[17:14.560 --> 17:21.200]  to the house. Then Wednesday is going to be, I got a comedy show. I'm going to go see Greg
[17:21.200 --> 17:26.080]  Proops at the Comedy Works in Denver. That's going to wrap up my 420 celebration week,
[17:26.080 --> 17:31.200]  unless something cool is happening Thursday or Friday. We're rolling deep already, so I got to
[17:31.200 --> 17:35.600]  quit making plans. We're putting a big bite in the wallet, but it's worth it, dude. It's 420
[17:35.600 --> 17:41.040]  weekend. We're going all out. All right. If you see me at one of those places, you want to join
[17:41.040 --> 17:45.120]  me at one of those places, you want to hang out before or after something like that, let me know.
[17:45.120 --> 17:49.520]  Also, at the Cannabis Cup, a few of my friends have booths. Garden of Weeden and the Smokers
[17:49.520 --> 17:54.720]  Club have a booth. My friends with Sour Seeds have a booth. A lot of my homies have booths.
[17:54.720 --> 17:59.920]  I will be hanging out at those booths, just kicking it. Sometimes I'll have... I may have
[17:59.920 --> 18:03.280]  a couple of t-shirts in my backpack. I don't really want to lug them around, but I may have
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.760]  some t-shirts with me. I won't have any seeds. I'm sold out of seeds, guys. I'm sorry. That's a
[18:07.760 --> 18:11.600]  good thing for me, a terrible thing for you, but nature's green remedies and all the locals clean
[18:11.600 --> 18:17.040]  me the fuck out. Thank you, guys. I'll be at those booths. I may do a little speaking. If somebody has
[18:17.040 --> 18:22.160]  questions or something, you can ask me questions. Don't be shy. Seriously, I'm just some dude. Walk
[18:22.160 --> 18:26.560]  up, shake my hand, introduce yourself. You may make a friend for life. I'm a shy guy myself.
[18:26.560 --> 18:30.400]  Honestly, you might not really believe that, but there's nobody here right now, so I could talk
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.600]  into a microphone. People freak me out, bro. That's my plan for the Cannabis Cup weekend.
[18:35.600 --> 18:39.760]  What else are we going to talk about? Let's get to this email that a friend of mine sent.
[18:41.840 --> 18:45.600]  FastBerry sent me an email. I'm looking for it. I've got so many emails here. Here we are.
[18:46.800 --> 18:50.960]  Dude, I know this is late. You sent me this on April 5th, but I haven't recorded a show since
[18:51.920 --> 18:57.680]  I had CannaVenture over, but I know my recording schedule is hectic and getting
[18:57.680 --> 19:02.720]  the episodes out once a week puts you behind on this. FastBerry at Gmail.com sent me this email.
[19:02.720 --> 19:07.040]  It says, Rhode Island needs some help. He said, I'm at FastBerry from Instagram. We have a problem
[19:07.040 --> 19:11.360]  in Rhode Island with the caregivers program. If you could read this and put the word out about
[19:11.360 --> 19:16.080]  connecting local government for anyone or about contacting local government for anyone who
[19:16.080 --> 19:23.920]  listens, the community would be grateful. If you are in Rhode Island, FastBerry needs your help.
[19:23.920 --> 19:27.840]  Apparently, there's some shit happening with the medical marijuana caregivers program in
[19:27.840 --> 19:32.960]  Rhode Island, and we need your support. Here's what you got to do. If you're in Rhode Island,
[19:33.920 --> 19:40.560]  go to this email or go to this website. It is http... Okay, go to ripatients.org, you guys.
[19:41.120 --> 19:48.240]  ripatients.org slash index dot html. That's where most of the information is organized and
[19:48.240 --> 19:52.960]  accessible is what FastBerry says. Also, make sure you follow FastBerry on Instagram.
[19:53.680 --> 19:56.640]  Tell him that you heard about him through the show. Give him a little bump on Instagram. Make
[19:56.640 --> 20:00.720]  him smile. But you got to do what you can do. I'm going to click on the link here and see what's
[20:00.720 --> 20:06.480]  going on. If you guys are in Rhode Island, that's part of your job to go there and contact your
[20:06.480 --> 20:12.000]  local Congress people and let them know that you don't like the bullshit they're trying to do.
[20:14.080 --> 20:18.400]  Bill seeks to eliminate caregivers. A new Senate bill would eliminate the caregiver to create
[20:19.360 --> 20:23.600]  for-profit entities that will grow and sell cannabis to the compassion... No,
[20:23.600 --> 20:27.600]  fuck that, dude. We don't need that. You guys, I'm going to contact these people and tell them
[20:27.600 --> 20:32.480]  that that's bullshit because that's kind of what happened here in Colorado indirectly. We got rid
[20:32.480 --> 20:36.560]  of the caregiver model. We got rid of the patients, and now it's just commercialized cannabis. And the
[20:36.560 --> 20:40.560]  medical patients that need quality herb are not getting it. And I feel that they're the ones that
[20:40.560 --> 20:44.880]  started this. So you guys in Rhode Island, don't let this shit happen, dude. That is stupid.
[20:44.880 --> 20:49.040]  Don't let that happen. Oh my God. Fastberry, thanks for getting my attention on that.
[20:49.040 --> 20:52.560]  I'll do what I can, dude. So that's a call to action. I don't ask you guys to do a lot of shit,
[20:52.560 --> 20:57.840]  but get on there and help Fastberry with that. All right. What's next on the agenda here?
[20:59.040 --> 21:02.320]  We're going 20 minutes. You guys want to do a really short episode? Let's read like one or
[21:02.320 --> 21:08.960]  two news articles and then just get the shit out of here, right? I've got some news articles.
[21:08.960 --> 21:12.720]  Here's one. You guys are going to like this one. I'm going to take a drink. I got some frosty,
[21:12.720 --> 21:24.480]  cold root beer just staring at me. Oh, that's delicious. Yeah. All right. So this article says,
[21:24.480 --> 21:29.280]  Colorado's record pot. No, let me read that again. That big drink made me fucking stupid.
[21:30.080 --> 21:34.800]  Speaking of being stupid, I'm going to rant here for a minute again. About 16 days ago,
[21:34.800 --> 21:39.600]  I got a major concussion. I don't think it, yeah, it was about 16 days ago, so I can't even count.
[21:40.480 --> 21:45.280]  I've talked about it on the show. I didn't realize, but I hit my head twice. I told you guys I hit my
[21:45.280 --> 21:49.200]  head, right? But I hit my head, but then I fell down some stairs and at the bottom of the stairs,
[21:49.200 --> 21:52.880]  I hit my head again. And I just found on the back of my head a few days ago, I found a nice well on
[21:52.880 --> 22:00.000]  the back there too. I was a lot more fucked up than I realized you guys. I recorded two podcasts
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.440]  with Mike and Adam that are fuzzy to me. I don't, a lot of that stuff, that guy talking wasn't
[22:05.440 --> 22:09.840]  completely Rasta Jeff. That's kind of my subconscious doing its weird shit on those episodes.
[22:10.560 --> 22:14.400]  The show with Canaventure with Rusty and Rob, I feel like it was kind of getting my shit back
[22:14.400 --> 22:18.480]  together. But there are moments in that podcast where I don't know what the fuck was going on,
[22:18.480 --> 22:22.560]  to tell you the truth. I hope you guys couldn't tell. I hope the show's been all right.
[22:23.120 --> 22:27.600]  But I'm kind of feeling like I'm getting back together. My brain is kind of unscrambling
[22:27.600 --> 22:32.240]  itself. Sometimes I forget dumb stuff. Like when I leave my house, if I'm going to certain people's
[22:32.240 --> 22:36.320]  houses, I have to think about when I pull out of the driveway, which way should I go?
[22:36.320 --> 22:39.280]  It used to be subconscious. If you're going to this guy's house, you turn left. If you're going
[22:39.280 --> 22:42.320]  to his, you turn right. Now I have to kind of think about it. Like, where are you going, bro?
[22:42.320 --> 22:45.840]  Oh, you're going to his house. You should go left. But that shit's coming back. Honestly,
[22:45.840 --> 22:51.040]  it's all coming back. Every doctor says that it just takes time. If you see me at the cannabis
[22:51.040 --> 22:54.880]  cup and you want to dab me out, please don't give me a half gram dab. Please don't fuck me up. I
[22:54.880 --> 23:00.800]  just need little dabs. I'm still healing. The dabs make my temperature go crazy. And it makes my
[23:00.800 --> 23:05.120]  wound on my head throb a lot. So don't dab me out too hard. But little dabs are cool. I take little
[23:05.120 --> 23:10.640]  dabs all day. But yeah, I know that's fucking random, right? Here we go. This article says,
[23:10.640 --> 23:19.600]  Colorado's record February pot sales yield $2.1 million for schools. That's right. Pot sales $2.1
[23:19.600 --> 23:24.320]  million for schools. Isn't that great? We're selling cannabis and it's paying for school.
[23:24.320 --> 23:28.320]  People never thought that would happen. I'm going to read you the article. It is by Ricardo Baca
[23:28.320 --> 23:34.080]  from The Cannabis. And it says, Colorado sold a record amount of recreational marijuana in February
[23:34.080 --> 23:41.280]  2015. According to new data released by the state on Friday, around $39.2 million of recreational
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.160]  cannabis was sold in state shops in February, according to calculations based on data provided
[23:46.160 --> 23:51.840]  by the Colorado Department of Revenue. The previous monthly record for recreational sales was January
[23:51.840 --> 23:58.480]  2015, $36.4 million. Much of that growth comes, excuse me, I'm burping from the root beer.
[23:59.040 --> 24:04.160]  Oh, here we go. I'm back on track. Much of that growth comes from additional shops opening up
[24:04.160 --> 24:09.120]  and still new recreational cities, including Aurora, Colorado's third most populous city that
[24:09.120 --> 24:14.960]  only started selling retail pot last October, experts say. We just opened the ninth store in
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.120]  Aurora, said Meg Collins, vice president of the business development for Good Chemistry,
[24:19.120 --> 24:23.520]  which operates a shop in central Denver and its brand new flagship store in Aurora,
[24:23.520 --> 24:28.000]  in addition to being part owners of Denver shop Wellspring. Wow, these guys are rolling.
[24:28.720 --> 24:33.200]  The activity in Aurora has helped boost those sales and tax numbers, and people are also getting
[24:33.200 --> 24:37.760]  more comfortable with purchasing legally, knowing that it's available and becoming a bit more
[24:37.760 --> 24:42.880]  mainstream, and that's helping sales too, which guys, people were afraid to go into the stores
[24:42.880 --> 24:47.200]  and buy recreational cannabis for some reason. People were afraid of medical cannabis for a long
[24:47.200 --> 24:52.880]  time, but it seems like people are kind of getting excited about it. Now, there was one group of
[24:52.880 --> 24:57.840]  people that were dispensary connoisseurs. They knew everything about the dispensary. And some people
[24:57.840 --> 25:03.760]  just seem kind of anxious to get in there. So the article goes on to say, and anything that
[25:03.760 --> 25:08.720]  helps legal sales helps erode the black market. Colorado's total medical marijuana sales in
[25:08.720 --> 25:16.240]  February, 2015 added up to about $29.3 million, up more than $1 million from the previous month.
[25:16.240 --> 25:21.040]  The record for medical marijuana sales in Colorado's recreational era, which started January
[25:21.040 --> 25:29.840]  1st, 2014, came in February of 2014 when $36 million in medical pot was sold. Another important
[25:29.840 --> 25:36.320]  indicator in Colorado's complex pot sales, pot, fuck, that's a lot of words. Another important
[25:36.320 --> 25:42.880]  indicator in Colorado's complex pot taxes is the amount dedicated for public schools,
[25:42.880 --> 25:47.520]  and that monthly total was more than $2 million for the second consecutive month in February.
[25:47.520 --> 25:53.200]  In January, the excise tax on wholesale marijuana transfers raised more than $2.3 million for
[25:53.200 --> 25:59.440]  schools, and in February, it totaled $2.1 million. The monthly excise taxes earmarked for school
[25:59.440 --> 26:05.440]  construction capital never topped $2 million in 2014, the first year of recreational pot sales
[26:05.440 --> 26:16.320]  in Colorado. In 2014, Colorado sold nearly $700 million a pot, $385.9 million for medical marijuana,
[26:16.320 --> 26:22.880]  and $313.2 million for recreational cannabis. Projections based on the first two months of
[26:22.880 --> 26:28.880]  2015's recreational and medical numbers suggest that Colorado will sell more marijuana and collect
[26:28.880 --> 26:38.480]  more in pot-related taxes in 2015 than it did in 2014. You know, I can support that. I'm the
[26:38.480 --> 26:41.840]  grower at the spot now, and we're still working on the grows and getting everything in place,
[26:41.840 --> 26:46.400]  but I'm there often in meetings and talking about where to put this and how to do that and where
[26:46.400 --> 26:50.960]  we're going to do everything and who's going to do what. But when I'm there, I see the sales
[26:50.960 --> 26:56.400]  happening, and they are getting busier than ever, busier than ever. And I also hang out,
[26:56.400 --> 26:59.200]  excuse me, I also hang out with my good friends at Green and Healthy Wellness,
[26:59.920 --> 27:05.440]  and I see those guys getting busier than ever. So more and more people are buying cannabis,
[27:05.440 --> 27:10.400]  and there are more shops popping up. And with more shops popping up around us,
[27:10.400 --> 27:15.840]  and the spot staying as busy as it is, that tells me that all those other shops have to be
[27:15.840 --> 27:19.680]  selling stuff too, because people go check out new places. And I feel like a lot of the people
[27:19.680 --> 27:24.560]  that come from out of state, they know they can only buy seven grams at one shop, so they probably
[27:24.560 --> 27:30.000]  go visit several shops. And in my area, there are a lot of them. I have lost count how many are out
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.960]  in Pueblo West right now. So the shops are getting busy, they're staying busy, it's only going to get
[27:34.960 --> 27:39.120]  busier. We're only going to bring in more money for the schools. They have actually fixed a bunch
[27:39.120 --> 27:42.400]  of potholes in my neighborhood, and I don't know if that was related to any cannabis money or not,
[27:42.400 --> 27:47.520]  but man, it was about time they fixed that shit. All right, what else do I got for you in the news
[27:47.520 --> 27:50.560]  world? Read a couple more articles, and then we're going to get out of here.
[27:51.120 --> 27:54.640]  This is a kind of a great article. I thought this guy was a freaking genius. This one's from
[27:54.640 --> 28:00.240]  The Cannabis Also. It says, City Council candidate who owns a pot shop is campaigning via pizza box.
[28:00.240 --> 28:05.200]  The article is by John Murray of the Denver Post, and it says, don't accuse Denver City Council at
[28:05.280 --> 28:13.440]  large candidate, Kavin, I got to say his name right, Calabari, Calabari, Calabari, yeah, I got
[28:13.440 --> 28:17.520]  that right, of getting lost in the crowd. If there's one thing he knows how to do, it's stand
[28:17.520 --> 28:22.800]  out, this time on a pizza box. Calabari has been harnessing the natural delivery system of one of
[28:22.800 --> 28:28.400]  several businesses he co-owns, Sexy Pizza, Pizza. Why can't I say pizza? I love pizza. It's hard to
[28:28.400 --> 28:33.520]  say. Sexy Pizza, which is three locations in central Denver neighborhoods, by affixing campaign
[28:33.520 --> 28:39.280]  flyers to pizza boxes before they're sent out to customers. Calabari says he printed 5,000 campaign
[28:39.280 --> 28:45.040]  flyers for the boxes, enough to last about two weeks at the pizza shops. The piece pictures
[28:45.040 --> 28:50.240]  Calabari under the words, I'm a real person. He's running against four others for two at-large
[28:50.240 --> 28:55.760]  seats in the May 5th election. Incumbents Debbie Ortega and Robin Kniech are fellow challengers,
[28:57.040 --> 29:00.720]  Joe Sylvia and Jeffrey Washington, oh, and fellow challengers, sorry, I read that word wrong,
[29:00.720 --> 29:06.560]  and fellow challengers, Joe Sylvia and Jeffrey Washington. So far, Calabari, excuse me, I got
[29:06.560 --> 29:09.920]  to take a drink. My throat's all clogged up. Let's go for some water this time. I think that root beer
[29:09.920 --> 29:15.600]  is what clogged me. All right, that's better. So far, Calabari, who also co-owns Denver Relief,
[29:15.600 --> 29:20.000]  the city's oldest marijuana dispensary, has raised some eyebrows among fellow candidates by missing
[29:20.000 --> 29:25.200]  candidate forums, though he says he had conflicts and plans to begin participating in some upcoming
[29:25.200 --> 29:30.080]  events. His pizza box flyers are unorthodox campaigning, where it gets a little squishy
[29:30.080 --> 29:35.440]  is that under Denver election code, Calabari must report sexy pizzas, seating of the cardboard real
[29:35.440 --> 29:42.400]  estate and arguably the delivery service as an in-kind contribution. He says he plans to do so,
[29:42.400 --> 29:48.240]  but it's unclear what that's worth. Denver leaves it up to candidates to assign a fair market value
[29:48.240 --> 29:53.280]  that's reasonable. Calabari says he's mulling that over and will probably rate the value at a penny
[29:53.280 --> 30:00.000]  or two per flyer or 50 to $100 total on his next campaign finance report. He says that's reasonable
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.040]  because he's used sexy pizzas boxes to promote his other businesses, including Denver Relief and
[30:07.040 --> 30:12.640]  sex bot comedy shows, as well as partners events at no charge. He pointed out that his campaign
[30:12.640 --> 30:17.360]  volunteers, not sexy pizzas employees, are attaching the flyers to the boxes in advance.
[30:17.920 --> 30:21.760]  So technically, he's not really using the pizza shop employees. He's using his own guys.
[30:22.560 --> 30:29.600]  So he's not using the pizza shop as like slave labor. Yeah, that's political crap you have to
[30:29.600 --> 30:34.960]  worry about. So perhaps it was inevitable that Calabari would attempt such synergy in his run
[30:34.960 --> 30:39.760]  for Denver City Council. This is after all the same guy who tried to make a point and mock Governor
[30:39.760 --> 30:44.720]  John Hickenlooper, a former beer brewer who opposed pot legalization by following him around in a
[30:44.720 --> 30:48.240]  chicken suit. And there's a picture of the student, a chicken suit smoking a spliff on a couch. It's
[30:48.240 --> 30:54.240]  pretty funny. Then it says, but his mailers strike a more serious tone, highlighting Calabari's
[30:54.240 --> 30:59.360]  business experience as an entrepreneur who started or helped start several local businesses
[30:59.360 --> 31:02.880]  and making the claim I have more business experience than all current city council
[31:02.880 --> 31:07.840]  members combined. He's careful to mention his ownership of the marijuana shop in passing
[31:07.840 --> 31:14.720]  below his support for LGBT and transgender gender, transgender rights, and his position as an
[31:14.720 --> 31:19.680]  opponent of greedy developers. He's drawn more serious fundraising support lately,
[31:19.680 --> 31:24.880]  out out raising the other four candidates in March by collecting $22,383.
[31:25.600 --> 31:29.040]  Though he still trails the incumbents overall totals significantly.
[31:31.440 --> 31:36.480]  That this article is written weird right here. It hard to say it is hard to say if he's rounding up
[31:36.480 --> 31:41.760]  enough support to threaten Ortega or niche on May 5. But Calabari always exudes confidence.
[31:41.760 --> 31:46.800]  He noted that the pizza box flyers amount to a fraction of his efforts. We're going to end up
[31:46.800 --> 31:52.080]  doing right around 70,000 mailers, he said, are going to go to various demographics and we're
[31:52.080 --> 31:58.000]  making a couple 1000 phone calls. The social media is really what I'm getting a kick out of right now.
[31:58.000 --> 32:03.120]  So this article was first published on the Denver post.com. I think it's great that this guy who is
[32:03.120 --> 32:08.400]  part owner of a dispensary owns a pizza joint and is running for office in Denver is attaching his
[32:08.400 --> 32:13.920]  flyers to pizza boxes. You're hitting your target audience. That's perfect. I'm sorry about the
[32:13.920 --> 32:19.520]  throat clearing in the funky voice here. You guys want to come talk on the podcast to be across the
[32:19.520 --> 32:23.440]  table from me so that I don't have to talk to the wall. You won't have to hear me clear my throat so
[32:23.440 --> 32:27.600]  much. I'd love you on the show. Tell me what you want to talk about. We'll bring you on. You don't
[32:27.600 --> 32:32.800]  have to be some elitist or anybody too crazy to get on this show. Just got to be cool. So you're
[32:32.800 --> 32:36.720]  not crazy. We'll bring you on. All right, I want to read one more article. How long have we been
[32:36.720 --> 32:43.600]  recording? Come here garage band. Show me show me 32 minutes. Um, if this article is short, we'll do
[32:43.600 --> 32:47.440]  it. If it's too long, we're going to skip it. Oh, that's long. I don't think we're going to do this
[32:47.440 --> 32:53.200]  article. No, it's too long. We'll just skip it. We'll talk about this one on the next episode.
[32:53.200 --> 32:57.760]  Yeah. So the next episode, we're going to do an article. We'll read article about a special report
[32:57.760 --> 33:03.120]  edible safety, still a concern for Colorado. We'll read that. Um, the next episode will probably
[33:03.120 --> 33:08.400]  actually come out on four 20. It's not going to be, um, a really long episode either, but the one
[33:08.400 --> 33:14.000]  after that will be my cannabis cup review episode. The episode after that, we're going to talk about
[33:14.000 --> 33:18.720]  planning your gardens, um, getting the schedule for your garden figured out so that you could be
[33:18.720 --> 33:22.640]  as productive as you can be so that you're not behind so that you're not ahead so that you're
[33:22.640 --> 33:29.600]  not missing clones when you need them. Um, I plan to get, uh, Jesse over to do more outdoor stuff.
[33:29.600 --> 33:34.800]  Jesse is a busy man lately. He's doing his own outdoor stuff. So we got to bear with him. Uh,
[33:34.800 --> 33:38.400]  we'll get Mike over to talk about some politics pretty soon. I've got a couple of more guests in
[33:38.400 --> 33:42.400]  mind. The cannabis cup is coming. So you never know what could happen at the cup. We may talk
[33:42.400 --> 33:47.040]  to some people while we're there. Let's see. What else do I need to talk about in this meeting or in
[33:47.040 --> 33:50.640]  this episode? I just saw the word meeting on my notepaper. So we'll talk about that. There's a
[33:50.640 --> 33:55.520]  grower's meeting, April 26th, that hydro indoor growing supplies. If you were in Pueblo, Colorado,
[33:55.520 --> 34:00.080]  or the surrounding area, it would be worth your time to come hang out with us at hydro indoor
[34:00.080 --> 34:05.280]  growing supplies at 618 East fourth street in beautiful Pueblo, Colorado. My friend Jesse has
[34:05.280 --> 34:10.880]  some things he wants to talk about. And if he doesn't do his whole time, uh, if he doesn't
[34:10.880 --> 34:14.720]  take the whole time, I plan to talk about some stuff. I'll probably repeat a little bit of the
[34:14.720 --> 34:19.760]  garden planning stuff that I plan on doing for the podcast episode. I'm writing it out for the class
[34:19.760 --> 34:24.880]  and the episode is one thing. Uh, I want to get that info out there. Um, let's see, what else
[34:24.880 --> 34:29.360]  should we talk about? Let's close up the show and I will see you guys in a few days. Like I said,
[34:29.360 --> 34:33.760]  guys, if you see me at any of these events coming up over the next week, I'm a tall white guy. I got
[34:33.760 --> 34:39.360]  dreadlocks. That probably there's going to be a lot of those there. Um, I do. I'm not the guy with
[34:39.360 --> 34:43.840]  dreadlocks in my beard. I do not have dreads in my beard. That's another guy. He's cool to high five
[34:43.840 --> 34:49.280]  him. But if you want to come up and meet me, introduce yourself. I'm not shy. I'm not afraid.
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.120]  I'd love to be your friend. So come say what's up. I am kind of shy, but I'm a, I'm not shy to meet
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.880]  you. I'm not shy to say hi to you. Come be my friend. Say what's up to me. I'm going to quit
[34:56.880 --> 35:01.360]  rambling. I'm going to wrap up the show here. What else do we want to say? I guess that's it.
