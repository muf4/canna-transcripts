[00:00.000 --> 00:01.000]  Here we go.
[00:01.000 --> 00:02.000]  What's up, podcast world?
[00:02.000 --> 00:07.080]  It is time for episode 516 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:38.560 --> 00:42.040]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:42.040 --> 00:50.080]  Today, I picked up a jar of sour diesel HCFSE, that is high cannabinoid full spectrum extract
[00:50.080 --> 00:51.760]  from Apothecary Farms.
[00:51.760 --> 00:56.000]  When you crack the jar open, it looks like little diamonds or little rocks in the jar.
[00:56.480 --> 01:01.400]  It's just straight chunky crystals of sour diesel high cannabinoid full spectrum extract.
[01:01.400 --> 01:07.960]  On the label, it says this product contains a total of 89.7% total cannabinoids.
[01:07.960 --> 01:10.840]  I really love the buzz from the sour diesel.
[01:10.840 --> 01:12.040]  It goes straight to my face.
[01:12.040 --> 01:13.400]  It goes straight to my head.
[01:13.400 --> 01:14.840]  It makes me feel warm.
[01:14.840 --> 01:18.000]  It makes me feel a little bit anxious, but I kind of like that.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.600]  That is the buzz I am shopping for.
[01:20.800 --> 01:27.880]  I also picked up a nice jar of Lemon OG High Terpene full spectrum extract.
[01:27.880 --> 01:30.360]  This is mainly just terp sauce.
[01:30.360 --> 01:32.400]  It's like a little jar of just terp water.
[01:32.400 --> 01:33.400]  It's kind of thick.
[01:33.400 --> 01:34.400]  It's a little viscous.
[01:34.400 --> 01:38.240]  It's a little thinner than maple syrup, but about that texture.
[01:38.240 --> 01:41.040]  It is much more clear than maple syrup.
[01:41.040 --> 01:43.680]  It's got a nice clear yellow color to it.
[01:43.680 --> 01:49.320]  The best part is this amazing Lemon OG Kush aroma coming out of this jar.
[01:49.320 --> 01:55.680]  I took a little portion of the HTFSE, the High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract liquid
[01:55.680 --> 02:01.680]  terps, and I gently poured that right into my jar of sour diesel high cannabinoid full
[02:01.680 --> 02:03.200]  spectrum extract.
[02:03.200 --> 02:07.480]  I made a nice little Lemon OG sour diesel slurry.
[02:07.480 --> 02:11.760]  When I dabbed that, I honestly had to take a moment and get my life together because
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.240]  I was high as shit, you guys.
[02:15.240 --> 02:16.600]  I had to put my head in my hands.
[02:16.600 --> 02:18.000]  I had to catch my breath.
[02:18.000 --> 02:21.760]  I went and took a few minutes on the couch to myself just so I could make sure to get
[02:21.760 --> 02:25.880]  my brains back together before I came and did this podcast.
[02:25.880 --> 02:30.960]  The short version of what I'm smoking today is sour diesel high cannabinoid full spectrum
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.880]  extract coated in Lemon OG High Terpene Full Spectrum Extract.
[02:36.880 --> 02:40.080]  It has got me in the perfect mood to do a podcast.
[02:40.080 --> 02:44.080]  I do have a great podcast topic lined up for us.
[02:44.080 --> 02:48.880]  Before we get there, let's do some shoutouts to a few of the kind folks who support the
[02:48.880 --> 02:50.880]  show on Patreon.
[02:50.880 --> 02:55.480]  Let's start off these shoutouts by rolling up a big fat joint for my buddy Ned Denver.
[02:55.480 --> 02:58.360]  Let's send a big shoutout to our buddy Stoned Troutbum.
[02:58.360 --> 03:01.600]  I always want to send a big fat dab to my buddy Ryan M.
[03:01.600 --> 03:04.800]  Let's pack up a big fresh bowl for my buddy Ces Burton.
[03:04.800 --> 03:08.800]  I have always got a big high five and a grow from your heart fist bump for my buddy Josiah
[03:08.800 --> 03:10.040]  W.
[03:10.040 --> 03:13.040]  Let's pack up a fresh bong load for my buddy Brett G.
[03:13.040 --> 03:17.400]  I've always got a big high five and a fat dab for my buddy Jacob W.
[03:17.400 --> 03:21.560]  Let's pack up a big fresh bong load for the hardest working man in cannabis.
[03:21.560 --> 03:24.480]  Let's send a fresh bong load over to my buddy James Brown.
[03:24.480 --> 03:27.480]  I've always got a big fat dab for my buddy Keith K.
[03:27.480 --> 03:33.080]  And last but certainly not least, let's load up a big fat dab for my buddy Cosmo.
[03:33.080 --> 03:38.760]  Big shoutout, big thank you to everybody who has continued to support the show on Patreon.
[03:38.760 --> 03:45.000]  If you would like to learn how to support the show, you can do so by visiting www.patreon.com
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.640]  forward slash grow from your heart.
[03:47.640 --> 03:50.240]  All of the info you need should be right there on the screen.
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.320]  And I also included a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it easy
[03:55.320 --> 03:58.240]  for my friends to find the Patreon campaign.
[03:58.240 --> 04:01.320]  All right, we're moving in on four minutes into this episode.
[04:01.320 --> 04:05.680]  I feel like I am finally done with the intro and the business part of the show.
[04:05.680 --> 04:10.280]  Let's work my way into the main topic of today's podcast episode.
[04:10.280 --> 04:13.560]  I am going to focus today's episode on the coronavirus.
[04:13.560 --> 04:16.240]  We are going to talk about the COVID-19 virus.
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.360]  I am mainly going to focus on how this virus is affecting us here in the United States,
[04:20.360 --> 04:22.480]  more specifically here in Colorado.
[04:22.480 --> 04:27.340]  But then I want to talk about more how this virus is affecting the cannabis industry.
[04:27.340 --> 04:30.000]  Also how it may affect other industries.
[04:30.000 --> 04:36.040]  Then I want to talk briefly about being prepared for a lockdown or a quarantine for our grow
[04:36.040 --> 04:37.040]  rooms.
[04:37.040 --> 04:40.840]  You may have all of the supplies you need for yourself and your family and your pets,
[04:40.840 --> 04:45.440]  but have you considered what you may need if we are quarantined or locked down and we
[04:45.440 --> 04:47.720]  need supplies for our grow room?
[04:47.720 --> 04:49.600]  The plants will continue to grow.
[04:49.600 --> 04:53.080]  They're going to need regular love and care just like we give them today, just like we
[04:53.080 --> 04:57.720]  are giving them before any sort of weird outbreak, any sort of weird social situations.
[04:57.720 --> 05:00.320]  Those plants require a lot of attention.
[05:00.320 --> 05:03.460]  Many people rely on their plants for medicine.
[05:03.460 --> 05:06.320]  Many people rely on their plants for income.
[05:06.320 --> 05:11.840]  Many people have spent a lot of money on seeds, equipment, electricity, and products to keep
[05:11.840 --> 05:13.100]  their grow alive.
[05:13.100 --> 05:18.900]  We cannot let these grows die simply because we are facing some adversity and some awkward
[05:18.900 --> 05:20.840]  social situations.
[05:20.840 --> 05:25.200]  So in this episode, we're going to work our way into talking about being prepared for
[05:25.200 --> 05:27.760]  a lockdown situation in a garden.
[05:27.760 --> 05:29.480]  Do you have what you need?
[05:29.480 --> 05:32.640]  I'm already getting ahead of myself, so let's back up a little bit.
[05:32.640 --> 05:35.600]  I said I wanted to talk about the coronavirus.
[05:35.600 --> 05:37.080]  That's where we're going to start.
[05:37.080 --> 05:41.480]  Unless you have been living on the other side of the moon, I am going to assume that everybody
[05:41.480 --> 05:45.200]  knows what the coronavirus is by now.
[05:45.200 --> 05:46.940]  Everybody has seen the news.
[05:46.940 --> 05:48.520]  Everybody has read the internet.
[05:48.520 --> 05:54.400]  Everybody has chosen how they are going to accept and believe the stories of the coronavirus.
[05:54.400 --> 05:56.080]  Some people are really freaking out.
[05:56.080 --> 05:57.640]  Some people are kind of ignoring it.
[05:57.640 --> 06:01.680]  And some people are in the middle, watching patiently, wondering what to do.
[06:01.680 --> 06:06.320]  I am not judging you for your position in this fear and hype moment.
[06:06.320 --> 06:11.840]  You do what feels best to you as long as you remember to think and stay compassionate and
[06:11.840 --> 06:15.360]  have empathy and remember that everybody is in this shit together.
[06:15.360 --> 06:18.040]  It's not every man for themselves at this point.
[06:18.040 --> 06:20.680]  It's not every woman and child for themselves at this point.
[06:20.680 --> 06:22.880]  It is everybody together.
[06:22.880 --> 06:24.060]  Keep that in mind.
[06:24.060 --> 06:26.940]  You are not only responsible for taking care of yourself.
[06:26.940 --> 06:29.820]  We must all take care of each other.
[06:29.820 --> 06:34.900]  So if you are freaking out about this pandemic, if you are completely ignoring this pandemic,
[06:34.900 --> 06:39.560]  or if you're kind of in the middle, waiting it out, wondering how to react day by day,
[06:39.560 --> 06:44.740]  that is okay as long as you don't forget that you are not in this shit alone and there are
[06:44.740 --> 06:49.420]  millions of other people dealing with the same shit as you and you've got to be compassionate
[06:49.420 --> 06:53.180]  to every person on the planet at this time.
[06:53.300 --> 06:59.620]  You also must take responsibility to not spread this virus to sick people.
[06:59.620 --> 07:00.780]  You may be healthy.
[07:00.780 --> 07:01.900]  You may be young.
[07:01.900 --> 07:05.180]  You may be laughing about this, but is your Nana healthy?
[07:05.180 --> 07:06.580]  Is your Papa healthy?
[07:06.580 --> 07:08.380]  Is everybody around them healthy?
[07:08.380 --> 07:11.340]  Do you have a sick child in your family?
[07:11.340 --> 07:15.300]  Don't be the person that thinks you can go out in public because you're young and healthy
[07:15.300 --> 07:18.380]  and you will be Superman and not cause any problems.
[07:18.380 --> 07:23.300]  You have the potential to pick up this virus and carry it to other people and not know
[07:23.300 --> 07:27.320]  it for several days, potentially two to three weeks.
[07:27.320 --> 07:31.180]  You can go outside yesterday and pick up the coronavirus.
[07:31.180 --> 07:35.700]  You won't know that you were even exposed to it for possibly two to three weeks if you
[07:35.700 --> 07:37.660]  even ever show any symptoms.
[07:37.660 --> 07:39.860]  Many people don't show symptoms.
[07:39.860 --> 07:43.380]  It is very likely that healthy people don't show symptoms.
[07:43.380 --> 07:44.700]  So you think you're fine.
[07:44.700 --> 07:47.340]  Now you go visit your Nana, but you're not fine.
[07:47.340 --> 07:49.340]  You've got coronavirus in your body.
[07:49.340 --> 07:50.460]  You talk to Nana.
[07:50.460 --> 07:51.500]  You give her a hug.
[07:51.500 --> 07:52.500]  You leave.
[07:52.500 --> 07:56.540]  Now three days later, Nana is sick as fuck and you may have killed Nana.
[07:56.540 --> 07:57.900]  Let's not kill Nana, please.
[07:57.900 --> 07:58.900]  We all love Nana.
[07:58.900 --> 07:59.900]  We all love Papa.
[07:59.900 --> 08:00.900]  My grandparents are gone.
[08:00.900 --> 08:01.900]  I miss them.
[08:01.900 --> 08:04.580]  I'm kind of glad they don't have to deal with this fucking coronavirus shit because it would
[08:04.580 --> 08:05.580]  have killed them.
[08:05.580 --> 08:08.380]  But let's not kill other old people.
[08:08.380 --> 08:12.900]  I'm healthy, but I'm staying away from elderly people because I have been around other people
[08:12.900 --> 08:15.260]  who have possibly been exposed to the coronavirus.
[08:15.260 --> 08:18.860]  I don't know that I have or have not, but it is definitely a possibility.
[08:18.860 --> 08:20.100]  I have been in public.
[08:20.100 --> 08:21.380]  I've been out and about.
[08:21.380 --> 08:22.820]  I've been many places.
[08:22.820 --> 08:25.340]  I wouldn't be surprised if I had the virus in my body.
[08:25.340 --> 08:30.380]  I wouldn't be surprised if many young people my age range, my health range have this virus
[08:30.380 --> 08:31.940]  and show zero symptoms.
[08:31.940 --> 08:35.100]  We could be spreading it to older people and fucking up lives.
[08:35.100 --> 08:38.360]  I know I'm off on a rant here, but my point is be responsible.
[08:38.360 --> 08:42.100]  Just because you don't show signs and symptoms doesn't mean that you can't be giving this
[08:42.100 --> 08:44.960]  to older, sicker, immunocompromised people.
[08:44.960 --> 08:48.360]  We need to think about everybody in this situation.
[08:48.360 --> 08:49.360]  Don't be selfish.
[08:49.360 --> 08:53.740]  Now, I am going to try to back myself up off of my soapbox because I feel like I just got
[08:53.740 --> 08:56.800]  really preachy and ranty, but this is important to me.
[08:56.800 --> 08:57.880]  We all have parents.
[08:57.880 --> 08:59.000]  We all have loved ones.
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.280]  We all have older people around us, and we need to learn to have responsibility, empathy,
[09:04.280 --> 09:08.240]  compassion, and patience for everybody in this time of need.
[09:08.240 --> 09:12.040]  You guys, I am trying to unite everybody is what I'm trying to do.
[09:12.040 --> 09:13.440]  Let's all come together.
[09:13.440 --> 09:19.760]  Let's not all be a sucker for fear and hype, but let's also not get the older people sick.
[09:19.760 --> 09:22.380]  If you don't have to go anywhere, don't go anywhere.
[09:22.380 --> 09:24.640]  If you don't have to be somewhere, don't be somewhere.
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.160]  If you can avoid groups and people, avoid groups and people.
[09:28.160 --> 09:29.160]  Be with your loved ones.
[09:29.160 --> 09:30.160]  Be with your family.
[09:30.160 --> 09:31.160]  Be in your home.
[09:31.160 --> 09:32.960]  Spend some time in the garden.
[09:32.960 --> 09:36.280]  Clean up that crap in your grow space that you've been ignoring and avoiding.
[09:36.280 --> 09:38.780]  Now is the time to get all that silly shit done.
[09:38.780 --> 09:42.920]  Take advantage of this time while we're taking a little bit of a quarantine period, a little
[09:42.920 --> 09:45.960]  bit of social distancing, and catch up on chores.
[09:45.960 --> 09:48.120]  Catch up on all the shit that you've been neglecting.
[09:48.120 --> 09:51.400]  Use this to your advantage, and let's not get any other people sick.
[09:51.400 --> 09:55.240]  Now, I am going to be a complete hypocrite here, and I'm going to tell you the moment
[09:55.240 --> 09:59.280]  that I realized I may be fucking up with this coronavirus.
[09:59.280 --> 10:01.280]  I honestly was on the fence with this.
[10:01.280 --> 10:03.320]  I was like, I'm not really going to take that seriously.
[10:03.320 --> 10:04.320]  I'm young.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.320]  I'm healthy.
[10:05.320 --> 10:07.680]  It feels like some more fear and hype planted by the government.
[10:07.680 --> 10:11.000]  All that stuff that the conspiracy theorists sort of say, that all got to my head.
[10:11.000 --> 10:12.600]  I believed it.
[10:13.280 --> 10:16.640]  In 2011, I went to a comedy show at Comedy Works in Denver.
[10:16.640 --> 10:19.040]  Comedy Works is a fairly small club.
[10:19.040 --> 10:20.640]  It is quite intimate.
[10:20.640 --> 10:23.560]  The building holds approximately 300 people.
[10:23.560 --> 10:28.200]  The comedy show I went to was sold out and has been sold out for several months.
[10:28.200 --> 10:32.440]  The comedian I was going to see is very famous and brings a large crowd.
[10:32.440 --> 10:38.040]  I knew something was strange because on my way to Denver, I-25 was almost empty.
[10:38.080 --> 10:43.400]  If you've ever traveled I-25 in the afternoon on a Thursday, empty is not the word.
[10:43.400 --> 10:45.320]  It's usually a fucking headache.
[10:45.320 --> 10:46.840]  You want to punch yourself in the face.
[10:46.840 --> 10:48.540]  You want to rear end people.
[10:48.540 --> 10:51.760]  You wish it was a Mad Max situation where you could just blow all the fucking cars up
[10:51.760 --> 10:54.120]  around you and get through the interstate.
[10:54.120 --> 10:59.320]  I got to Denver in about an hour and 45 minutes, and it should usually take me two hours and
[10:59.320 --> 11:01.440]  20 to get to Comedy Works.
[11:01.440 --> 11:03.180]  But the interstate was empty.
[11:03.180 --> 11:05.800]  When I got to Denver, Denver was empty.
[11:05.800 --> 11:09.800]  When I got to the parking garage, where I usually have to drive around for a few minutes
[11:09.800 --> 11:13.600]  and search for a spot, the parking garage was empty.
[11:13.600 --> 11:17.580]  The gas station on the way where I stopped to pee was empty, and they would not allow
[11:17.580 --> 11:21.840]  people into the gas station until you properly sanitized your hands.
[11:21.840 --> 11:24.480]  They had a hand sanitizing station outside.
[11:24.480 --> 11:26.840]  You were in line to sanitize your hands before you went in.
[11:26.840 --> 11:28.080]  Then you were allowed to go in.
[11:28.080 --> 11:29.080]  All I had to do was pee.
[11:29.080 --> 11:30.080]  I was on the road for a minute.
[11:30.080 --> 11:31.080]  I had to pee real bad.
[11:31.080 --> 11:35.760]  So I sanitized my hands, went in, went pee like I needed to, came back out, re-sanitized
[11:35.760 --> 11:39.160]  my hands again because I just went pee and I was going to get in the car, make sure I'm
[11:39.160 --> 11:40.680]  clean, got back in the car.
[11:40.680 --> 11:42.740]  Then I boogied up to the comedy show.
[11:42.740 --> 11:45.520]  Like I said, the parking lot was completely empty.
[11:45.520 --> 11:48.800]  The line to get into the comedy club was fairly low.
[11:48.800 --> 11:53.720]  When we got into the comedy club, I realized it's almost showtime, and there are only about
[11:53.720 --> 11:57.520]  three quarters of the people here that have bought tickets.
[11:57.520 --> 12:02.120]  There's a little section in the back of Comedy Works that was completely empty.
[12:02.120 --> 12:03.820]  Usually that club is completely full.
[12:03.900 --> 12:08.940]  So that tells me a bunch of people abandoned their expensive comedy show tickets for a
[12:08.940 --> 12:13.940]  very popular comedian for a show that was sold out months in advance, and they did not
[12:13.940 --> 12:16.260]  even bother to come to the show.
[12:16.260 --> 12:20.820]  I think when I was sitting there at Comedy Works debating on if I wanted to order snacks
[12:20.820 --> 12:25.260]  or if I just wanted to get a bottle of water as my beverage and kind of not touch anything
[12:25.260 --> 12:30.180]  and keep myself safe, I think that is the moment when I realized this is something serious.
[12:30.260 --> 12:34.580]  I may be making a mistake being here in this large group of people.
[12:34.580 --> 12:36.780]  But another part of me said, what are you going to do?
[12:36.780 --> 12:38.860]  Are you going to live in fear forever?
[12:38.860 --> 12:40.260]  Comedy is your favorite thing.
[12:40.260 --> 12:43.900]  You've got to come to comedy shows, and this is one of your favorite comedians.
[12:43.900 --> 12:47.660]  So shut the fuck up and enjoy this for an hour and a half, and we can freak out on the
[12:47.660 --> 12:49.140]  ride home.
[12:49.140 --> 12:51.220]  That is exactly what I did.
[12:51.220 --> 12:54.420]  I ordered a bottle of root beer, which was nice because I haven't been consuming much
[12:54.420 --> 12:56.900]  sugar, so that root beer was really delicious.
[12:56.900 --> 13:00.980]  I got a little bit of a snack, and then I chilled out and waited for the comedy show
[13:00.980 --> 13:01.980]  to start.
[13:01.980 --> 13:06.900]  When the comedy show started, I completely forgot about any fear, any worry, any sort
[13:06.900 --> 13:08.020]  of stress.
[13:08.020 --> 13:09.420]  Comedy is one of my favorite things.
[13:09.420 --> 13:11.980]  I quickly fell into the comedy zone.
[13:11.980 --> 13:16.260]  The comedy show was hosted by a comedian known as Georgia Comstock.
[13:16.260 --> 13:17.780]  That was the first time I heard of her.
[13:17.780 --> 13:21.780]  I will be a fan for life because she was hilarious.
[13:21.780 --> 13:26.160]  She's a little bit younger than me, but she's a Colorado person, and she's a pot smoker,
[13:26.160 --> 13:29.800]  and she's fucking funny, so I will be following her comedy.
[13:29.800 --> 13:33.400]  The next comedian on the bill was a guy known as Kevin Christie.
[13:33.400 --> 13:37.860]  I am pretty sure that I have heard Kevin Christie on Bob and Tom years ago.
[13:37.860 --> 13:39.080]  He is hilarious.
[13:39.080 --> 13:40.960]  He's got a great presence to him.
[13:40.960 --> 13:44.480]  He's kind of got a don't give a fuck sort of a vibe to him, what I really like.
[13:44.480 --> 13:47.240]  He's got that divorced dad sort of a comedy vibe.
[13:47.240 --> 13:50.080]  I was really enjoying his energy and his jokes.
[13:50.080 --> 13:55.140]  He started the show off with something about, hey, Denver Comedy Works, we're here.
[13:55.140 --> 13:57.220]  Are we really brave or really stupid?
[13:57.220 --> 14:01.300]  Then everybody laughed, and then he said, I guess we'll find out in about a week.
[14:01.300 --> 14:04.540]  Everybody kind of laughed and looked around like, ah, fuck, he's bright.
[14:04.540 --> 14:07.140]  It was really funny because we had all just kind of ... I don't know.
[14:07.140 --> 14:10.820]  When you're there at a comedy show, you just give up on the outside world, and you just
[14:10.820 --> 14:11.820]  laugh.
[14:11.820 --> 14:12.820]  That's what you're there for.
[14:12.820 --> 14:18.020]  A good comedian will make light of a shitty situation, and that is exactly what Kevin
[14:18.020 --> 14:19.260]  Christie did.
[14:19.260 --> 14:21.620]  We were off to a great start at the comedy show.
[14:21.620 --> 14:22.820]  We had a wonderful hostess.
[14:22.820 --> 14:24.580]  We had a wonderful feature act.
[14:25.020 --> 14:27.300]  Then the headliner came on stage.
[14:27.300 --> 14:33.860]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am excited because I finally got to see Bobby Lee live on stage
[14:33.860 --> 14:36.340]  at Comedy Works in Denver, Colorado.
[14:36.340 --> 14:42.220]  Bobby Lee was fucking hilariously awesome live on stage.
[14:42.220 --> 14:45.100]  Bobby Lee is mostly known for his time on Mad TV.
[14:45.100 --> 14:47.100]  He's also got a podcast called Tiger Belly.
[14:47.100 --> 14:50.060]  He is also on another podcast called Bad Friends.
[14:50.060 --> 14:52.900]  I listen to and watch everything Bobby Lee puts out.
[14:52.900 --> 14:55.460]  I think he is fucking hilarious.
[14:55.460 --> 15:01.820]  One thing I did not realize when I saw Bobby Lee live is he is super comfortable on stage.
[15:01.820 --> 15:03.780]  He is a maniac on the stage.
[15:03.780 --> 15:08.820]  The dude is maybe five feet tall, but he commands the stage like a fucking giant.
[15:08.820 --> 15:14.340]  The guys that come from the comedy store in LA have a special power of confidence on the
[15:14.340 --> 15:15.780]  stage.
[15:15.780 --> 15:20.660]  Bobby Lee tends to play that he is aloof or not fully aware of what's going on or that
[15:20.660 --> 15:25.020]  he is kind of disassociated with the situation or he is not fully paying attention.
[15:25.020 --> 15:28.980]  I have discovered that that has got to be a fucking character because when he was on
[15:28.980 --> 15:31.260]  stage, he never missed a beat.
[15:31.260 --> 15:33.620]  He was on point the entire time.
[15:33.620 --> 15:35.500]  He was on fucking fire.
[15:35.500 --> 15:38.420]  He would do crowd work and he would ask the crowd a question.
[15:38.420 --> 15:42.060]  When he would reply, most people have body language or something, he would not respond
[15:42.060 --> 15:43.140]  to your answer.
[15:43.140 --> 15:48.060]  He would make a joke about your body language, but it was so rapid fire that it was impressive
[15:48.060 --> 15:49.060]  to me.
[15:49.060 --> 15:54.940]  I have seen countless comedians on countless stages and Bobby Lee was one of the most comfortable
[15:54.940 --> 15:57.620]  people I have ever seen on a stage.
[15:57.620 --> 16:00.040]  It was really impressive to me.
[16:00.040 --> 16:04.000]  Another thing that was really impressive is how much Bobby Lee plays with the crowd.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.660]  He was flirting with one guy on stage.
[16:05.660 --> 16:09.620]  He was making fun of another guy off the stage the entire show and he would keep coming back
[16:09.620 --> 16:10.620]  to it.
[16:10.620 --> 16:14.900]  Then one time he took off his shirt for another joke, which we'll get to here in a moment,
[16:14.900 --> 16:17.380]  and he tried to get a guy in the front row to touch his stomach.
[16:17.700 --> 16:22.780]  When the guy reached for his stomach, he grabbed his hand and made the audience member palm
[16:22.780 --> 16:24.700]  Bobby Lee's dick.
[16:24.700 --> 16:27.540]  He's Asian and he goes, ha ha, I trick you, I play joke.
[16:27.540 --> 16:30.180]  It was fucking hilarious.
[16:30.180 --> 16:32.940]  If Bobby would have done that to a female, there would have been a crime involved, but
[16:32.940 --> 16:33.940]  it was a guy.
[16:33.940 --> 16:34.940]  It was in the front row.
[16:34.940 --> 16:36.340]  It was fucking hilarious.
[16:36.340 --> 16:37.340]  That will not be a problem.
[16:37.340 --> 16:41.900]  Shout out to Bobby Lee for his amazing fucking confidence on stage.
[16:41.900 --> 16:47.100]  Another thing I noticed is Bobby Lee got involved in a one-on-one conversation with an audience
[16:47.820 --> 16:48.820]  member.
[16:48.820 --> 16:49.820]  There was a person up front.
[16:49.820 --> 16:52.580]  Bobby Lee was setting up a joke, but he had to give the audience member a little bit of
[16:52.580 --> 16:55.580]  a prompt, a little bit of a joke.
[16:55.580 --> 16:57.820]  He had to give him a cue and tell him what he needed to say.
[16:57.820 --> 17:00.020]  He was setting up the bit a little bit.
[17:00.020 --> 17:04.020]  While Bobby was setting up that bit, the crowd got restless and we started chatting amongst
[17:04.020 --> 17:05.100]  ourselves, which happens.
[17:05.100 --> 17:09.300]  If you stop telling jokes, the crowd will fall off.
[17:09.300 --> 17:12.780]  Most of the time, it is hard for a comedian to get the crowd back.
[17:12.780 --> 17:14.660]  He lost about 250 people.
[17:14.660 --> 17:15.660]  We're all talking.
[17:15.660 --> 17:16.660]  Nobody was paying attention.
[17:17.220 --> 17:21.460]  It took Bobby two words to get the entire crowd back in action.
[17:21.460 --> 17:22.460]  He was quiet.
[17:22.460 --> 17:24.460]  You could hear him talking to the other guys like, so when I say this, you're going to
[17:24.460 --> 17:25.460]  say this and you'll do this.
[17:25.460 --> 17:26.460]  Okay, are you ready?
[17:26.460 --> 17:27.460]  Okay.
[17:27.460 --> 17:28.460]  Then Bobby Lee goes, okay, fuckers, comedy works.
[17:28.460 --> 17:29.460]  Are you ready?
[17:29.460 --> 17:31.380]  I'm going to do a fucking joke for you.
[17:31.380 --> 17:35.900]  As soon as he said, I'm going to do a fucking joke for you, everybody was back on track.
[17:35.900 --> 17:37.000]  Nobody was talking.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.860]  Everybody was full focus on Bobby Lee.
[17:39.860 --> 17:41.300]  I don't know if you're a public speaker.
[17:41.300 --> 17:43.100]  I don't know if you're a comedian.
[17:43.100 --> 17:45.020]  That is a fucking impressive superpower.
[17:45.100 --> 17:46.660]  I was blown away by that.
[17:46.660 --> 17:51.540]  I've seen comedians lose the crowd before and it's hard as shit to get them back.
[17:51.540 --> 17:54.140]  Bobby Lee said, hey, fuckers, I'm going to do a joke for you.
[17:54.140 --> 17:55.140]  And we're all right there.
[17:55.140 --> 17:56.180]  It just took one prompt.
[17:56.180 --> 17:57.180]  We were all back.
[17:57.180 --> 18:01.340]  It may sound weird to a non-comedy nerd, but that was amazing to me.
[18:01.340 --> 18:04.180]  The highlight of the Bobby Lee show.
[18:04.180 --> 18:10.100]  One highlight, Bobby Lee gave a full on dirty blow job to a microphone stand, deep throated
[18:10.100 --> 18:11.980]  it, got it all slobbery, drooled on himself.
[18:11.980 --> 18:15.740]  And about halfway through, he realized I've got coronavirus from this.
[18:15.740 --> 18:16.740]  And it was really funny.
[18:16.740 --> 18:19.820]  I saw the moment in his face that there it is.
[18:19.820 --> 18:20.820]  I shouldn't be doing this.
[18:20.820 --> 18:24.780]  Like I heard the switch go off in his brain and he realized it like, oh, fuck, I'm sucking
[18:24.780 --> 18:25.780]  this microphone.
[18:25.780 --> 18:27.260]  I'm completely going to get Corona.
[18:27.260 --> 18:28.380]  It was hilarious.
[18:28.380 --> 18:29.940]  That was a great moment.
[18:29.940 --> 18:31.740]  The most hilarious part of the show.
[18:31.740 --> 18:35.940]  I don't want to ruin for anybody who may go see Bobby Lee in the future.
[18:35.940 --> 18:40.180]  Let's just say that I have seen Bobby Lee naked and I was in the front row of comedy
[18:40.180 --> 18:43.300]  works and I've still got that image burned in my head.
[18:43.300 --> 18:48.420]  If you go look at Bobby Lee live on Instagram, you will see the exact image that I saw.
[18:48.420 --> 18:52.300]  Bobby Lee put on rubber gloves because of the coronavirus.
[18:52.300 --> 18:56.420]  Bobby Lee put on a surgical mask because of the coronavirus.
[18:56.420 --> 19:00.780]  Then Bobby Lee stripped down to his underwear, which were way too baggy and all of his cash
[19:00.780 --> 19:02.700]  and prizes were hanging right out.
[19:02.700 --> 19:08.340]  And we all got to see Bobby's little fupa and his poorly shaven ball sack and his disgusting
[19:08.340 --> 19:09.420]  butt crack.
[19:09.500 --> 19:13.580]  Honestly, I haven't laughed that fucking hard in a year.
[19:13.580 --> 19:15.700]  Joey Diaz made me laugh one way.
[19:15.700 --> 19:17.900]  Theo Vaughn made me laugh another way.
[19:17.900 --> 19:22.340]  But the way that Bobby Lee made me laugh made it feel like something in my brain could come
[19:22.340 --> 19:23.740]  undone at any moment.
[19:23.740 --> 19:26.840]  I thought I could have a stroke or a fucking seizure.
[19:26.840 --> 19:30.020]  It was like elementary school laughter.
[19:30.020 --> 19:34.740]  Just when the kid in elementary school is just so fucking stupid, you can't stop laughing.
[19:34.740 --> 19:38.520]  That's what I was experiencing from Bobby Lee being naked on stage.
[19:38.620 --> 19:42.880]  We agreed to not take out our phones and take photos or videos at Comedy Works, but there
[19:42.880 --> 19:46.600]  was a moment when I had the best photo opportunity.
[19:46.600 --> 19:51.520]  He was just wearing his little underwear and his surgical mask and his rubber gloves and
[19:51.520 --> 19:55.080]  he had the microphone in his hand all awkward and he had his legs crossed sitting on a bar
[19:55.080 --> 19:57.880]  stool directly in front of me, just giving a speech.
[19:57.880 --> 20:02.020]  He was thanking the crowd for coming, basically, because he said, I didn't know if I should
[20:02.020 --> 20:03.020]  even show up.
[20:03.020 --> 20:04.200]  I didn't know if you would show up.
[20:04.200 --> 20:07.120]  You people that came are bad motherfuckers, so thank you.
[20:07.120 --> 20:09.080]  The photo opportunity I had was amazing.
[20:09.080 --> 20:11.760]  You guys, I wish I would have taken that shot, but I didn't want to get kicked out of the
[20:11.760 --> 20:15.160]  club, so I did not take out my phone, but it was awesome.
[20:15.160 --> 20:18.080]  You guys, Bobby Lee was fucking amazing.
[20:18.080 --> 20:23.240]  He made me laugh and forget for quite a while that we are facing some weird situations in
[20:23.240 --> 20:28.760]  the world right now, so I want to send a big thank you to everybody at Comedy Works.
[20:28.760 --> 20:32.020]  I know I say that every time I talk about that club.
[20:32.020 --> 20:35.980]  Everybody at Comedy Works treats me like I'm a VIP, like I'm a fucking rock star.
[20:35.980 --> 20:37.080]  I appreciate it.
[20:37.080 --> 20:38.440]  It does not go unnoticed.
[20:38.440 --> 20:43.280]  I respect it, and I love you guys so much for the fucking superstar treatment.
[20:43.280 --> 20:47.760]  Also, let's send a big, giant shout out to Georgia Comstock.
[20:47.760 --> 20:49.920]  That young lady is fucking hilarious.
[20:49.920 --> 20:50.920]  Pay attention.
[20:50.920 --> 20:52.520]  She will be famous one day.
[20:52.520 --> 20:55.120]  Also, big shout out to Kevin Christie.
[20:55.120 --> 20:56.800]  Kevin Christie is fucking hilarious.
[20:56.800 --> 20:58.480]  I think he's already somewhere.
[20:58.480 --> 21:00.000]  He's only going to keep rising.
[21:00.000 --> 21:05.360]  Then, of course, I want to send a big, huge thank you, like a sigh of relief kind of a
[21:05.600 --> 21:07.120]  thank you to Bobby Lee.
[21:07.120 --> 21:11.080]  Bobby really let me let go of some stress, let me kind of forget about the crap that
[21:11.080 --> 21:13.440]  was going on outside of that comedy club.
[21:13.440 --> 21:14.520]  Really made me feel better.
[21:14.520 --> 21:18.520]  I love comedy, so big thanks to everybody involved in that situation.
[21:18.520 --> 21:22.960]  I also want to send another shout out because I made a new friend that evening.
[21:22.960 --> 21:25.640]  I ended up at the comedy club by myself.
[21:25.640 --> 21:28.060]  I invited a friend at the last moment.
[21:28.060 --> 21:29.760]  That friend couldn't get the day off of work.
[21:29.760 --> 21:31.280]  I invited another friend.
[21:31.280 --> 21:32.280]  They couldn't go.
[21:32.280 --> 21:38.000]  I called another friend who ended up being sick and having pneumonia or bronchitis.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.240]  That friend couldn't go.
[21:39.240 --> 21:42.980]  After inviting three people, I decided I'm going to drive up to the club and give my
[21:42.980 --> 21:46.720]  extra ticket away because I can have fun at a comedy show by myself.
[21:46.720 --> 21:48.600]  You just got to sit there and laugh.
[21:48.600 --> 21:50.760]  All I'm doing is paying attention to a comedian.
[21:50.760 --> 21:51.760]  I did just that.
[21:51.760 --> 21:55.040]  I went to the club and I said, hey, bro, I don't need my extra ticket.
[21:55.040 --> 21:57.240]  I let the guy at the door know there was an extra ticket.
[21:57.240 --> 21:58.240]  That is always polite.
[21:58.240 --> 22:01.960]  That way, if somebody is waiting outside trying to get into the show, they know my extra ticket
[22:02.640 --> 22:03.640]  is available.
[22:03.640 --> 22:04.640]  They can give them or sell them that ticket.
[22:04.640 --> 22:08.360]  I find it to be polite to let the comedy club know that I bought a seat that will not be
[22:08.360 --> 22:10.320]  used and it is now available.
[22:10.320 --> 22:11.640]  They can capitalize that on it.
[22:11.640 --> 22:12.640]  They can resell it.
[22:12.640 --> 22:13.920]  They can put someone in that seat.
[22:13.920 --> 22:16.080]  Empty seats cost money in clubs.
[22:16.080 --> 22:17.800]  That's just the right thing to do.
[22:17.800 --> 22:18.800]  I ended up sitting.
[22:18.800 --> 22:20.840]  I've got a little VIP thing at Comedy Works.
[22:20.840 --> 22:22.400]  I always end up down in the front row.
[22:22.400 --> 22:23.520]  They expected two people.
[22:23.520 --> 22:24.720]  They saved me two seats.
[22:24.720 --> 22:28.600]  That means the next weirdo to show up by himself got sat next to me.
[22:28.600 --> 22:31.520]  Worked out well because I met a huge comedy fan.
[22:32.080 --> 22:33.080]  He's a giant fan of Bobby Lee.
[22:33.080 --> 22:37.400]  He's a big fan of most of the comedy shows I listen to and the podcasts I enjoy.
[22:37.400 --> 22:41.120]  There are a few which we completely don't agree on, which I find to be great.
[22:41.120 --> 22:43.400]  That makes good friends and good conversation.
[22:43.400 --> 22:44.760]  So shout out to my new buddy, Hayden.
[22:44.760 --> 22:45.760]  It was great meeting you.
[22:45.760 --> 22:47.120]  It was great chilling out with you.
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.840]  I was fun taking a dab with you.
[22:48.840 --> 22:50.520]  I hope everything is well with you, bro.
[22:50.520 --> 22:53.760]  Look forward to doing another comedy show with you in the future.
[22:53.760 --> 22:57.280]  So that is my quick breakdown on going to Denver.
[22:57.280 --> 23:00.680]  My quick rundown of going to see Bobby Lee at Comedy Works.
[23:00.680 --> 23:03.800]  That is when I decided I need to quit going out.
[23:03.800 --> 23:05.120]  I need to quit doing shit.
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.440]  I need to do some shopping and get supplies and hunker down and stay here in the stoner
[23:09.440 --> 23:13.520]  cave and my man cave and the Grow From Your Heart podcast studio.
[23:13.520 --> 23:18.240]  I just need to chill out and not expose myself and not be a contagion and not spread this
[23:18.240 --> 23:19.520]  shit any further.
[23:19.520 --> 23:22.200]  So that's what I've been trying to do for the past few days.
[23:22.200 --> 23:23.760]  I got plenty of groceries.
[23:23.760 --> 23:25.160]  I didn't buy excessive shit, you guys.
[23:25.160 --> 23:29.160]  I got enough for myself and people close to me for several days.
[23:29.160 --> 23:30.720]  They will get more stuff at the store.
[23:30.720 --> 23:31.720]  They're going to get more trucks.
[23:31.720 --> 23:32.720]  They'll bring more shit.
[23:32.720 --> 23:33.840]  We didn't have to buy it all in the first day.
[23:33.840 --> 23:35.320]  I don't know what that was about.
[23:35.320 --> 23:37.640]  And why did you buy 17 cases of toilet paper?
[23:37.640 --> 23:38.880]  How much are you going to shit?
[23:38.880 --> 23:40.040]  That's what I want to know.
[23:40.040 --> 23:43.520]  If you didn't buy food and you bought a lot of toilet paper, that's poor planning.
[23:43.520 --> 23:44.520]  That's backwards.
[23:44.520 --> 23:46.200]  You're going to end up eating the toilet paper.
[23:46.200 --> 23:50.320]  And maybe that works because maybe it will auto wipe, but that's the only benefit there.
[23:50.320 --> 23:51.320]  Let's stay on track.
[23:51.320 --> 23:52.320]  I'm obviously high.
[23:52.320 --> 23:55.960]  I went and got myself a bunch of supplies and now I'm hunkered down here in the house.
[23:55.960 --> 23:57.760]  I don't plan on going anywhere.
[23:57.760 --> 24:00.840]  I think they are going to start restricting movement.
[24:00.840 --> 24:02.800]  They have restricted group sizes.
[24:02.800 --> 24:05.960]  They have started closing many establishments.
[24:05.960 --> 24:11.800]  Starting tomorrow in my area, bars and restaurants and places of entertainment will be forced
[24:11.800 --> 24:13.840]  to close their doors.
[24:13.840 --> 24:16.080]  This is where this talk gets serious, you guys.
[24:16.080 --> 24:20.640]  The coronavirus is finally starting to have huge impact on a lot of our lives.
[24:20.640 --> 24:22.760]  Many of us didn't take it seriously at first.
[24:22.760 --> 24:24.360]  A lot of us still are not.
[24:24.360 --> 24:28.520]  I think now we are going to start seeing major impact.
[24:28.520 --> 24:30.560]  How is it impacting me personally?
[24:30.560 --> 24:35.920]  It has already impacted me because the Dude Grows Cup has been postponed.
[24:35.920 --> 24:39.360]  We were planning the Dude Grows Cup in April in Denver.
[24:39.360 --> 24:42.440]  That is an event where iRegenetics does a lot of vending.
[24:42.440 --> 24:45.480]  That covers a lot of my costs for the next couple of months.
[24:45.480 --> 24:47.800]  Without that event, I don't have that income.
[24:47.800 --> 24:50.400]  I am already feeling it in my wallet.
[24:50.400 --> 24:53.640]  That is the first hit to our economy that I am experiencing.
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.680]  That is the first major thing that I am experiencing due to the coronavirus.
[24:57.680 --> 25:02.520]  A major event where a lot of my friends were traveling from out of state and also out of
[25:02.520 --> 25:03.520]  country.
[25:03.520 --> 25:08.240]  They were coming to Denver to hang out, to meet me, to network, to grab seeds, to do
[25:08.240 --> 25:09.400]  a podcast.
[25:09.400 --> 25:11.380]  A lot of that stuff has been canceled.
[25:11.380 --> 25:15.160]  A lot of the 420 events are going to be postponed or canceled.
[25:15.160 --> 25:18.160]  We may be doing 420 in July this year, you guys.
[25:18.160 --> 25:20.360]  It may be 720 this year.
[25:20.360 --> 25:22.320]  But things are going to be different.
[25:22.320 --> 25:26.240]  There is already one dispensary that has announced they are now closed.
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.480]  I have a very close friend who has a job at a local dispensary and they spent half their
[25:30.480 --> 25:35.080]  day today checking their phone to see if they work tomorrow and hoping they still have a
[25:35.080 --> 25:36.880]  job after tomorrow.
[25:36.880 --> 25:38.400]  They do not know.
[25:38.400 --> 25:42.400]  Their corporate manager does not know and will not know until tomorrow.
[25:42.400 --> 25:44.400]  Probably sometime tomorrow afternoon.
[25:44.400 --> 25:49.080]  So everybody is in a state of confusion and flux and panic right now.
[25:49.080 --> 25:53.240]  All of my friends in the service industry, all of the bartenders, the waitstaff, the
[25:53.240 --> 25:56.840]  restaurant folk, they are all out of jobs right now.
[25:56.840 --> 26:00.760]  All of the people in the music industry, I have got several friends in the nightlife,
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.720]  entertainment, and music industry, all of the musicians are shit out of luck right now.
[26:05.720 --> 26:10.520]  All of the people that cook for you, serve you drinks, and perform for you are all scared
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.680]  shitless about their economic future right now.
[26:13.680 --> 26:18.180]  At this time, we have not officially been quarantined or shut down, but there are very
[26:18.280 --> 26:20.980]  strong rumors that we will be quarantined.
[26:20.980 --> 26:25.460]  The entire nation will face some sort of quarantine and we will be locked down and confined to
[26:25.460 --> 26:28.700]  our homes for a undetermined length of time.
[26:28.700 --> 26:33.400]  It is hard to predict all of the problems and ripples that could come from this.
[26:33.400 --> 26:35.180]  People are going to lose jobs.
[26:35.180 --> 26:36.620]  People are going to lose careers.
[26:36.620 --> 26:39.500]  The world is going to change because of this situation.
[26:39.500 --> 26:43.060]  I know I'm building up more fear and hype, but this is the reality.
[26:43.060 --> 26:47.340]  What is going to happen eventually, you guys, is maybe the grocery stores may be closed.
[26:47.340 --> 26:49.940]  This is something I was working toward in all of this talk.
[26:49.940 --> 26:52.020]  The grocery stores may get shut down.
[26:52.020 --> 26:54.300]  All of our supply chains may get shut down.
[26:54.300 --> 26:58.060]  If we are not allowed to go to work, if we're not allowed to leave our houses, if we can't
[26:58.060 --> 27:03.820]  be in groups, how are supplies going to move from the warehouse to whatever store they
[27:03.820 --> 27:04.820]  get to?
[27:04.820 --> 27:05.820]  There's no truck driver.
[27:05.820 --> 27:06.820]  There's nobody at the warehouse.
[27:06.820 --> 27:07.820]  There's nobody at the store.
[27:07.820 --> 27:09.420]  We're not allowed to go to the stores.
[27:09.420 --> 27:12.300]  How are we going to be able to get our supplies?
[27:12.300 --> 27:18.540]  Hopefully, there is a solution to food and basic supplies like that, but non-essential
[27:18.540 --> 27:21.580]  supplies will be put on the back burner.
[27:21.580 --> 27:25.860]  Your grocery supplies are going to get loaded on the truck very last.
[27:25.860 --> 27:30.020]  If there is room on the truck after they have stocked all of the food and all of the medical
[27:30.020 --> 27:34.740]  necessities to take to whatever area that truck is going, if there's a pallet of grocery
[27:34.740 --> 27:36.580]  supplies, that may make it on the truck.
[27:36.580 --> 27:40.340]  But for now, that is going to be a back burner scenario.
[27:40.340 --> 27:44.540]  You're not going to be able to get any of the extra shit that you do not need that
[27:44.540 --> 27:47.140]  is not essential to survival.
[27:47.140 --> 27:52.380]  So what are we going to do when we start running out of supplies for the grow room?
[27:52.380 --> 27:56.140]  Are you prepared for 30 days of survival outside of the grow room?
[27:56.140 --> 28:01.420]  Do you have food and water and vitamins and whatever medicine you take and essentials
[28:01.420 --> 28:03.220]  and medical supplies?
[28:03.220 --> 28:07.500]  But then, do you have everything to keep your plants alive?
[28:07.500 --> 28:12.180]  This is where the organic farmers and the no-till farmers are really going to shine.
[28:12.180 --> 28:15.060]  They will still need supplies, but they can survive.
[28:15.060 --> 28:16.060]  They have learned to survive.
[28:16.060 --> 28:19.780]  They have been functioning with what is around them and what is there.
[28:19.780 --> 28:23.100]  They may have to learn how to eliminate some of the things they may have been getting from
[28:23.100 --> 28:28.060]  Amazon, but that's when we learn to adapt and find the things around us within walking
[28:28.060 --> 28:32.940]  distance that we can use for our organic farming and organic growing.
[28:32.940 --> 28:38.680]  So the no-till guys, the organic guys, the probiotic farmer guys, they are already ahead
[28:38.680 --> 28:42.260]  of us in a worst case, end of the world scenario.
[28:42.260 --> 28:46.220]  And I feel that they have an advantage because if they can grow cannabis in that sort of
[28:46.220 --> 28:50.780]  scenario, they can grow anything and we will be going to them to get our fruits and vegetables
[28:50.780 --> 28:51.780]  when they harvest.
[28:51.780 --> 28:55.140]  Hopefully, we'll be going to them to help them man that farm so that when it's time
[28:55.140 --> 28:59.260]  to harvest, we can get what is fair for us and we're not just there leeching off of them.
[28:59.260 --> 29:01.660]  We can contribute and help a little bit.
[29:01.660 --> 29:05.380]  But for the growers who rely on the bottled nutrients, who rely on the grow store, who
[29:05.380 --> 29:09.900]  rely on that truck or Amazon to come every once a month and drop off all your shit, what
[29:09.900 --> 29:11.220]  are we going to do?
[29:11.220 --> 29:12.780]  Do you know how to adjust?
[29:12.780 --> 29:16.860]  If you don't get that bottle of base nutrients, do you know what to use to keep your plants
[29:16.860 --> 29:17.860]  alive?
[29:17.860 --> 29:19.100]  Have you made some sort of a plan?
[29:19.100 --> 29:21.820]  Have you ever thought about what happens when you run out of CalMag?
[29:21.820 --> 29:23.980]  What happens when I run out of pH down?
[29:23.980 --> 29:28.340]  Do you know how to do your grow without all of the shit from the store?
[29:28.340 --> 29:33.500]  I honestly never put too much thought into this situation until I was at the store stocking
[29:33.500 --> 29:38.340]  up on supplies for myself and I wondered, do I have all the shit I need to keep my plants
[29:38.340 --> 29:39.340]  alive?
[29:39.340 --> 29:43.580]  And I'm pretty sure I do because I work with some great companies who send me bulk shit
[29:43.580 --> 29:44.580]  all the time.
[29:44.580 --> 29:46.380]  So I've got an accidental stockpile.
[29:46.380 --> 29:51.620]  But if I didn't have that accidental stockpile, I don't know how long my grow supplies would
[29:51.620 --> 29:53.120]  have been stocked up.
[29:53.120 --> 29:57.300]  And I honestly don't know that if I run out of bottled nutrients and all my store bought
[29:57.300 --> 30:01.020]  powder nutrients and all that stuff I've gotten from all the hydro stores and my vendors
[30:01.020 --> 30:06.140]  and my friends, do I know what to go outside and grab to be able to make nutrients for
[30:06.140 --> 30:07.140]  my plants?
[30:07.140 --> 30:11.180]  I honestly don't know if I've got that ability without doing a little bit of research.
[30:11.180 --> 30:15.700]  Luckily, I've got friends like Jesse and Sean and I've got the entire internet to rely on
[30:15.700 --> 30:16.940]  to help me out.
[30:16.940 --> 30:21.180]  But if it came down to it, I don't know that I could keep those plants alive for more than
[30:21.180 --> 30:23.380]  a couple of weeks without nutrients.
[30:23.380 --> 30:26.980]  They will survive for a while without nutrients if they're healthy now.
[30:26.980 --> 30:28.340]  They've got nutrients stored up.
[30:28.340 --> 30:30.020]  There's nutrients in the soil.
[30:30.020 --> 30:34.620]  But eventually those plants are going to require more than water, which brings up another really
[30:34.620 --> 30:35.780]  good point.
[30:35.780 --> 30:40.860]  Do you have enough clean water to feed your plants in a worst case scenario?
[30:40.860 --> 30:42.700]  We may run out of drinking water.
[30:42.700 --> 30:45.460]  All of the bottled water is gone at the store.
[30:45.460 --> 30:46.980]  I am not joking.
[30:46.980 --> 30:50.340]  Every store in my city is sold out of bottled water.
[30:50.340 --> 30:53.220]  Everywhere for about 50 miles of me, no bottled water.
[30:53.220 --> 30:55.540]  If you're thirsty, hopefully you've got a bottle.
[30:55.540 --> 30:58.500]  If not, drink from the hose like we did back when we were kids.
[30:58.500 --> 31:00.120]  There is no bottled water.
[31:00.120 --> 31:01.820]  Do you have water for your plants?
[31:01.820 --> 31:03.340]  Do you have some sort of reserve?
[31:03.340 --> 31:04.340]  Do you have a reservoir?
[31:04.340 --> 31:06.180]  Do you have backup water?
[31:06.180 --> 31:07.300]  Is that water clean?
[31:07.300 --> 31:12.440]  Will it be kept potable and usable for your plants or drinkable for a period of time?
[31:12.440 --> 31:14.020]  Water is crucial.
[31:14.020 --> 31:17.460]  When it comes down to it, are you going to drink that water or are you going to use it
[31:17.460 --> 31:18.460]  for your plants?
[31:18.460 --> 31:20.380]  It may be time to make a decision.
[31:20.380 --> 31:27.940]  I am hoping that this coronavirus situation is just a short teaser and an eye opener and
[31:27.940 --> 31:30.540]  an example of what could come in the future.
[31:30.540 --> 31:36.860]  I really hope we don't see another major pandemic or something like this, but I'm hoping this
[31:36.860 --> 31:39.940]  is just a heads up, a learning lesson.
[31:39.940 --> 31:43.700]  I hope this is like mother nature or the earth or whatever God you believe in.
[31:43.700 --> 31:47.740]  I hope this is your God saying, hey people, you've kind of gotten out of hand and you
[31:47.740 --> 31:50.060]  didn't prepare properly for big problems.
[31:50.060 --> 31:54.020]  I'm going to show you that I can decimate your planet in just a few weeks.
[31:54.020 --> 31:55.140]  So here you go.
[31:55.140 --> 31:58.380]  And then I hope this is a learning lesson and I hope it is done.
[31:58.380 --> 32:02.820]  This has gone way too far for me to say, I hope this blows over quickly, but I hope it's
[32:02.820 --> 32:03.820]  almost done.
[32:03.820 --> 32:04.980]  I hope it has reached its peak.
[32:04.980 --> 32:06.900]  I hope it is on the downslope now.
[32:06.900 --> 32:11.780]  I hope we're coming out of this and I really hope that the entire world takes it as a learning
[32:11.780 --> 32:12.780]  lesson.
[32:12.780 --> 32:17.420]  And I hope we all learn how to take this shit seriously and let's all learn how to identify
[32:17.420 --> 32:20.860]  and respect this sort of a problem when it comes up next time.
[32:20.860 --> 32:22.900]  You guys, I feel like I got super rambly.
[32:22.900 --> 32:24.340]  I had a few bullet points.
[32:24.340 --> 32:26.020]  I went right through them really quickly.
[32:26.020 --> 32:27.700]  It felt like a chaotic episode.
[32:27.700 --> 32:29.260]  I feel like I had a lot to say.
[32:29.260 --> 32:30.980]  I had a lot on my mind.
[32:30.980 --> 32:32.660]  I hope I got it out clearly.
[32:32.660 --> 32:37.780]  The most important part in all of this is that we take care of each other.
[32:37.780 --> 32:40.540]  I know I say that a lot, but that is very important.
[32:40.540 --> 32:42.460]  What do we have if we don't have each other?
[32:42.460 --> 32:46.700]  What are we doing if we're doing it for ourselves and not for everybody around us?
[32:46.700 --> 32:48.100]  We've got to think about our families.
[32:48.100 --> 32:49.660]  We've got to think about our communities.
[32:49.660 --> 32:53.940]  We've got to think about the elderly people and we've also got to worry about the children.
[32:53.940 --> 32:59.020]  It is far too easy to get selfish in these times, in this world, with all the social
[32:59.020 --> 33:02.180]  media, with all the self-absorption and self-consumption.
[33:02.180 --> 33:05.220]  It is very easy to be self-consumed.
[33:05.220 --> 33:06.340]  Let's open our eyes.
[33:06.340 --> 33:07.480]  Let's open our hearts.
[33:07.480 --> 33:11.340]  Let's share our love and energy and anything else anybody else needs.
[33:11.340 --> 33:12.340]  Let's spread it.
[33:12.340 --> 33:13.340]  Let's share it.
[33:13.340 --> 33:14.340]  It's time, you guys.
[33:14.340 --> 33:15.340]  It is time.
[33:15.420 --> 33:18.260]  We are facing so many divisions in the world today.
[33:18.260 --> 33:23.180]  If it's from a virus, if it's from politics, there are so many things trying to divide
[33:23.180 --> 33:24.180]  humanity.
[33:24.180 --> 33:29.020]  It is more important now than ever that we all stick together and love one another.
[33:29.020 --> 33:32.420]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, thank you for listening to me ramble for way too
[33:32.420 --> 33:34.300]  long about the coronavirus.

[35:29.250 --> 35:54.670]  Let there not be hopeless sinners, who has hurt all mankind, just to save his own belief.
[35:54.670 --> 36:05.480]  Want to get together and feel alright.
[36:05.480 --> 36:07.480]  As it was in the beginning.
[36:07.480 --> 36:18.980]  Want some praise from the Lord, and I will feel alright.
[36:18.980 --> 36:23.980]  Let's get together and feel alright.
[36:23.980 --> 36:43.280]  Let's get together to fight this holy Armageddon
[36:43.280 --> 37:02.180]  Whose chances grow tender of creation
[37:02.180 --> 37:15.190]  Let's get together and feel alright
[37:15.190 --> 37:27.350]  Thanks and thanks to the Lord, feel alright
[37:27.350 --> 37:40.040]  Let's get together to fight this holy Armageddon
[37:41.040 --> 37:52.750]  So when the man comes, whose chances grow tender
[37:52.750 --> 37:58.750]  There in her hiding place, from the Father of creation
[37:58.750 --> 38:19.130]  Say it!
[38:24.130 --> 39:06.900]  Feel alright
[39:07.900 --> 40:10.280]  Let's get together and feel alright
[40:17.200 --> 40:23.200]  Thanks and thanks to the Lord, feel alright
