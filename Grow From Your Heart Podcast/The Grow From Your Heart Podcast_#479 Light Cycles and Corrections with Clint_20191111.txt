[00:00.000 --> 00:02.080]  Here we go, Clint, you ready?
[00:02.080 --> 00:03.400]  I am ready, Jeff.
[00:03.400 --> 00:04.560]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:04.560 --> 00:08.440]  It is time for episode 479 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.440 --> 00:12.480]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:12.480 --> 00:17.040]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:17.040 --> 00:24.740]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:24.740 --> 00:26.720]  As you just heard, my buddy Clint is back.
[00:26.720 --> 00:27.720]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:27.720 --> 00:28.720]  Hey, buddy.
[00:28.720 --> 00:29.720]  What's up, man?
[00:29.720 --> 00:31.760]  You're in stone to shit doing a podcast.
[00:31.760 --> 00:32.760]  Hell yeah, dude.
[00:32.760 --> 00:33.760]  Thanks for having me over.
[00:33.760 --> 00:34.760]  Oh, dude, thanks for coming over.
[00:34.760 --> 00:37.200]  I was going to try to talk you into doing a dab, but I think I would rather have you
[00:37.200 --> 00:38.560]  coherent for the podcast.
[00:38.560 --> 00:40.760]  Yeah, that'd be my first and last.
[00:40.760 --> 00:42.160]  Yeah, Clint is not a dabber.
[00:42.160 --> 00:43.640]  Are you smoking some flowers over there?
[00:43.640 --> 00:44.640]  I sure am.
[00:44.640 --> 00:46.240]  What are you smoking, bro?
[00:46.240 --> 00:51.880]  Tonight I actually got my hands on some, well, the strain I got told it was AK-47.
[00:51.880 --> 00:52.880]  Ah, some classics.
[00:52.880 --> 00:55.000]  Yeah, that's what I got told.
[00:55.000 --> 00:56.600]  Is that what I took a puff off of yesterday?
[00:56.600 --> 00:57.920]  Yes, it is.
[00:57.920 --> 01:01.240]  That was floral and fruity and very delicious.
[01:01.240 --> 01:02.520]  I really think it's good.
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.360]  And fortunately, I got a clean pipe right now, so everything tastes a lot better through
[01:07.360 --> 01:08.360]  that.
[01:08.360 --> 01:09.600]  I love a nice, fresh, clean pipe.
[01:09.600 --> 01:11.280]  My rig needs a cleaning.
[01:11.280 --> 01:13.720]  My concentrate probably would taste better had I cleaned that.
[01:13.720 --> 01:15.980]  So good job on the clean pipe.
[01:15.980 --> 01:18.040]  Did you grow that herb?
[01:18.040 --> 01:21.640]  That herb is actually a close friend grew that.
[01:21.640 --> 01:23.200]  Okay, well, they did a very good job.
[01:23.200 --> 01:24.200]  Hell yeah.
[01:24.200 --> 01:25.200]  Compliments to the chef.
[01:25.200 --> 01:26.200]  Oh, I'll definitely let them know.
[01:26.200 --> 01:27.200]  Yes, pass that on.
[01:27.200 --> 01:28.200]  Thank you very much, sir.
[01:28.200 --> 01:29.200]  For sure.
[01:29.200 --> 01:31.280]  We like to start the podcast off by talking about what we're smoking.
[01:31.280 --> 01:33.000]  I usually talk about what I'm smoking.
[01:33.000 --> 01:36.400]  Today, I am smoking something that I think tastes quite divine.
[01:36.400 --> 01:38.120]  This is the Peach Wrecker.
[01:38.120 --> 01:39.120]  I've got a combo.
[01:39.120 --> 01:43.040]  I've got the full spectrum extract and I've also got the live batter.
[01:43.040 --> 01:47.080]  Peach Wrecker, full spectrum extract and live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[01:47.080 --> 01:50.720]  This is a blend of Day Wrecker and Peach Oz.
[01:50.720 --> 01:55.600]  On the package, the flavor is described as peach, honey, and gas.
[01:56.120 --> 01:58.320]  When I open it, the first thing you get is peach.
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.080]  It is kind of like a fuzzy navel, is sort of the flavor.
[02:02.080 --> 02:04.840]  Then when you hit it, that peach flavor hits you first.
[02:04.840 --> 02:09.440]  It's more like a white grape kind of a peach thing, like a generic peach juice, a fake
[02:09.440 --> 02:12.000]  peach juice you'd get at the grocery store in a carton.
[02:12.000 --> 02:14.000]  It's got that peach juice flavor.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  I'm not dissing the flavor.
[02:15.000 --> 02:17.320]  I'm just saying that's the version of peach that I get from it.
[02:17.320 --> 02:18.320]  Nice.
[02:18.320 --> 02:20.360]  Then on the exhale, the honey comes in.
[02:20.360 --> 02:21.640]  I feel the honey on my tongue.
[02:21.640 --> 02:23.520]  It gets sweet and soft on my tongue.
[02:23.520 --> 02:25.920]  That honey comes in on the exhale and it just chills there.
[02:25.920 --> 02:27.240]  I was really digging that.
[02:27.240 --> 02:30.640]  The gas is there, but not as much as the peach and the honey.
[02:30.640 --> 02:31.640]  That's good.
[02:31.640 --> 02:33.240]  Yeah, and it is definitely delicious.
[02:33.240 --> 02:39.040]  I took a little glob of the live batter and got enough of that on the dabber to work as
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.040]  a little bit of a paste.
[02:40.040 --> 02:43.440]  Then I stuck a giant full spectrum extract diamond into that.
[02:43.440 --> 02:46.040]  Then I dipped that into a little bit of the Terp sauce in here.
[02:46.040 --> 02:49.000]  Obviously, it's got me fucking talkative and rambly.
[02:49.000 --> 02:50.600]  That's a delicious concentrate.
[02:50.600 --> 02:51.600]  That's what we're doing tonight.
[02:51.600 --> 02:53.440]  Jeff, you make me want to do dabs.
[02:53.480 --> 02:54.480]  Are you sure?
[02:54.480 --> 02:55.480]  I'm never going to.
[02:55.480 --> 02:56.480]  Because we can make this happen.
[02:56.480 --> 02:57.480]  Nah, not tonight, brother.
[02:57.480 --> 02:58.480]  All right.
[02:58.480 --> 02:59.480]  By the end of the show, we might get him to do a dab, you guys.
[02:59.480 --> 03:02.040]  You're always putting them over, man.
[03:02.040 --> 03:04.840]  They always sound so delicious coming out of you.
[03:04.840 --> 03:06.200]  You can smell these anytime you want.
[03:06.200 --> 03:07.920]  Reach over and smell any of these delicious concentrates.
[03:07.920 --> 03:10.920]  There's a table covered in ... Yeah, that's a good one there.
[03:10.920 --> 03:11.920]  Oh, here's a good one.
[03:11.920 --> 03:13.320]  That's a big jar there, so it's going to smell yummy.
[03:13.320 --> 03:15.440]  I'm going to smell it, then we'll see what I got.
[03:15.440 --> 03:16.440]  That's perfect.
[03:16.440 --> 03:19.200]  I got an insufficient nose, though, for sure.
[03:19.200 --> 03:20.200]  Insufficient.
[03:20.200 --> 03:21.200]  Well- An untrained nose.
[03:21.200 --> 03:23.200]  Yeah, I'll bet it's a lot of that.
[03:23.960 --> 03:25.880]  I'm going to give it to the non-connoisseur.
[03:25.880 --> 03:26.880]  I like this naked-
[03:26.880 --> 03:31.560]  Oh, look at all the ... Am I allowed to say what I'm looking at?
[03:31.560 --> 03:32.560]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[03:32.560 --> 03:33.560]  Tell the world.
[03:33.560 --> 03:34.560]  Look at all those crystals.
[03:34.560 --> 03:37.600]  It's a four-gram jar of Mai Tai full-spectrum extract.
[03:37.600 --> 03:38.600]  That's brand new.
[03:38.600 --> 03:39.600]  That's untouched.
[03:39.600 --> 03:40.600]  That's four grams.
[03:40.600 --> 03:41.600]  Yeah.
[03:41.600 --> 03:42.600]  It is beautiful.
[03:42.600 --> 03:45.960]  Would you say it looks like golden caviar, basically?
[03:45.960 --> 03:47.160]  He's giving it a sniff.
[03:47.160 --> 03:48.880]  That smells so nice.
[03:48.880 --> 03:49.880]  Can you describe it at all?
[03:49.880 --> 03:50.880]  Do you have-
[03:50.880 --> 03:59.840]  It's just like right when the plants get into flowering, like right near the end, right
[03:59.840 --> 04:02.680]  before you're going to harvest, like when you give them that squeeze and it's like real
[04:02.680 --> 04:04.680]  floral still.
[04:04.680 --> 04:05.680]  That's what I smell.
[04:05.680 --> 04:06.680]  All right.
[04:06.680 --> 04:09.120]  That's because it's made from ... I'm pretty sure that that one comes from fresh frozen
[04:09.120 --> 04:10.120]  plants.
[04:10.120 --> 04:11.120]  And gassy.
[04:11.120 --> 04:12.120]  Gassy, all right.
[04:12.120 --> 04:13.680]  That might be more of just like ... I don't know.
[04:13.680 --> 04:15.200]  Will you give it a smell and-
[04:15.200 --> 04:16.200]  Oh, for sure.
[04:16.200 --> 04:19.520]  ... maybe we can compare on what we're talking about?
[04:19.520 --> 04:20.800]  I get the floral.
[04:21.720 --> 04:23.720]  I get a hint of grandpa's aftershave.
[04:23.720 --> 04:24.720]  Damn.
[04:24.720 --> 04:27.720]  For sure that's in there.
[04:27.720 --> 04:28.720]  Okay.
[04:28.720 --> 04:29.720]  Yeah.
[04:29.720 --> 04:30.720]  That's a fun game to play.
[04:30.720 --> 04:31.720]  That's fun.
[04:31.720 --> 04:32.720]  Hey, do you smell?
[04:32.720 --> 04:39.520]  I was going to do the thing that we do to clerks, they do on the movie Clerks, where
[04:39.520 --> 04:42.520]  I'm like, hey, does this smell like ass to you?
[04:42.520 --> 04:46.600]  Oh, is that ready to rumble when he has like his finger ... Do you remember that movie?
[04:46.600 --> 04:47.600]  Okay.
[04:47.600 --> 04:49.600]  We're getting into the weeds on some movies all of a sudden.
[04:49.600 --> 04:50.600]  We're getting into the weeds on a movie.
[04:51.400 --> 04:52.400]  All right.
[04:52.400 --> 04:53.400]  This smells delicious.
[04:53.400 --> 04:54.400]  Shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[04:54.400 --> 04:57.040]  What we're smelling is Mai Tai.
[04:57.040 --> 05:00.400]  It's a blend of sunset sherbet and sherbert.
[05:00.400 --> 05:01.400]  They put sherbert on here.
[05:01.400 --> 05:03.840]  It should be ... I don't know if that R goes in there or not, but they can write it their
[05:03.840 --> 05:04.840]  way.
[05:04.840 --> 05:08.280]  And Purple Punch, it's called tropical fruit cocktail is what they describe it as.
[05:08.280 --> 05:09.320]  I'm going to agree with that.
[05:09.320 --> 05:10.800]  There's tropical fruit cocktail in there.
[05:10.800 --> 05:11.800]  Tropical fruit cocktail.
[05:11.800 --> 05:12.800]  Man.
[05:12.800 --> 05:16.040]  But there's also a hint of that cologne sort of a smell that I enjoy.
[05:16.040 --> 05:17.040]  Yeah.
[05:17.040 --> 05:19.800]  There's like some like brute old spice.
[05:20.000 --> 05:21.480]  The blue one, it's blue.
[05:21.480 --> 05:23.360]  Whatever comes in the old blue bottle.
[05:23.360 --> 05:25.160]  Old guy aftershave in a blue bottle.
[05:25.160 --> 05:26.160]  Dang.
[05:26.160 --> 05:27.160]  We're going to get some emails.
[05:27.160 --> 05:28.160]  Yes, we are.
[05:28.160 --> 05:29.160]  That'll be great.
[05:29.160 --> 05:30.160]  We're already like six minutes in.
[05:30.160 --> 05:31.640]  We haven't talked about ganja at all.
[05:31.640 --> 05:32.640]  This is going to be great.
[05:32.640 --> 05:33.640]  Dang.
[05:33.640 --> 05:34.640]  Okay.
[05:34.640 --> 05:35.640]  So I opened another one real quick.
[05:35.640 --> 05:36.640]  I'm curious what you've got.
[05:36.640 --> 05:41.200]  And this one has a huge crystal in it, so that's pretty tight.
[05:41.200 --> 05:43.720]  Oh, I already know what that is because of the huge crystal.
[05:43.720 --> 05:44.720]  Yeah.
[05:44.720 --> 05:48.840]  It says Headbanger, so Headbanger and HSB, so geez.
[05:48.880 --> 05:49.880]  Yeah, for sure.
[05:49.880 --> 05:50.880]  Right.
[05:50.880 --> 05:51.880]  Oh, then that's the garlic.
[05:51.880 --> 05:52.880]  Oh, you got the garlic banger.
[05:52.880 --> 05:53.880]  I was going to say.
[05:53.880 --> 05:56.120]  Well, you've got the garlic banger.
[05:56.120 --> 05:57.120]  Yeah.
[05:57.120 --> 05:58.120]  So that's gassy.
[05:58.120 --> 05:59.120]  Did you get trash can?
[05:59.120 --> 06:00.120]  I just.
[06:00.120 --> 06:01.120]  Smell like mashed potatoes in trash can?
[06:01.120 --> 06:03.320]  I got the trash can for sure.
[06:03.320 --> 06:04.320]  Yeah.
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.320]  Yeah.
[06:05.320 --> 06:07.600]  That sounds like a terrible description, but when you smell a cannabis that smells
[06:07.600 --> 06:11.640]  in concentrates that smell like a trash can, for some reason, it's really desirable.
[06:11.640 --> 06:15.080]  It's so weird what I'm attracted to when I'm looking for weed.
[06:15.080 --> 06:16.080]  Isn't it?
[06:16.080 --> 06:17.080]  But the nose knows.
[06:17.320 --> 06:18.320]  I'm going to take the nose.
[06:18.320 --> 06:21.880]  I've done a podcast called Follow Your Nose because I feel like your nose knows what your
[06:21.880 --> 06:23.260]  body needs.
[06:23.260 --> 06:29.240]  Does this, and this is going to be a really random question, is there almost a sexual
[06:29.240 --> 06:30.600]  aroma to this?
[06:30.600 --> 06:35.960]  Like something that would almost trigger a sexual pheromone in that smell, that earthy,
[06:35.960 --> 06:40.040]  almost kind of an armpity, summery.
[06:40.040 --> 06:44.160]  And I don't mean like summer, but I mean like somebody in the summer.
[06:44.160 --> 06:46.000]  Smells like sex panther.
[06:46.520 --> 06:51.240]  Well, Clint is a part-time comedian, so sex panther is going to be the answer we go with.
[06:51.240 --> 06:56.040]  It has a, there's definitely a funk to it, like a body odor sort of a thing, but yeah,
[06:56.040 --> 06:59.280]  I really think that one smells fucking grossly good.
[06:59.280 --> 07:00.280]  That's pretty tight, dude.
[07:00.280 --> 07:05.520]  It see in the stuff that you got in front of you is just the most beautiful crystals
[07:05.520 --> 07:06.660]  and stuff.
[07:06.660 --> 07:09.040]  How pretty these things are coming out is awesome.
[07:09.040 --> 07:12.720]  I would say thank you, but all I did was hand money over for it.
[07:12.720 --> 07:15.400]  This is all of our friends at Green Dot Labs doing this good work here.
[07:15.800 --> 07:17.360]  I guess I'm putting them over.
[07:17.360 --> 07:18.360]  Yeah.
[07:18.360 --> 07:21.160]  Well, let's move on because we're going to make people frustrated with the plethora and
[07:21.160 --> 07:22.520]  buffet of concentrates we've got.
[07:22.520 --> 07:25.760]  And there are people listening in places that they don't have access to this and we don't
[07:25.760 --> 07:30.800]  need to rub it into their faces that we've got something called doses and mimosas sitting
[07:30.800 --> 07:33.880]  here on the table that looks like magic and some Mai Tai.
[07:33.880 --> 07:36.600]  They don't need to know about all that stuff we've got here.
[07:36.600 --> 07:39.000]  Clint, I'd like to look on your face.
[07:39.000 --> 07:40.000]  They don't know nothing.
[07:40.000 --> 07:41.600]  Where the F are we in this podcast?
[07:41.600 --> 07:42.600]  What we're smoking on?
[07:42.600 --> 07:43.600]  I just hit the peach record.
[07:43.600 --> 07:45.520]  Clint is smoking AK 47.
[07:45.520 --> 07:46.520]  We're stoned.
[07:46.520 --> 07:47.520]  Obviously.
[07:47.520 --> 07:48.520]  Welcome to the show.
[07:48.520 --> 07:49.520]  Obviously.
[07:49.520 --> 07:50.520]  Let's level out and get this going, bro.
[07:50.520 --> 07:51.520]  You ready?
[07:51.520 --> 07:52.520]  Hell yeah.
[07:52.520 --> 07:53.520]  Here we go.
[07:53.520 --> 07:55.400]  This is the point in the show where we give shout outs to our friends who support us on
[07:55.400 --> 07:56.400]  Patreon.
[07:56.400 --> 07:57.400]  I'd like to start off with a big giant.
[07:57.400 --> 08:00.000]  I said giant, so it's going to be in French today.
[08:00.000 --> 08:01.000]  How about a big giant?
[08:01.000 --> 08:02.000]  The road from your podcast.
[08:02.000 --> 08:03.000]  Now let's just go back to English.
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.160]  A shout out and a thank you to let's start off with Miss Mel.
[08:07.160 --> 08:08.160]  Let's go ladies first.
[08:08.160 --> 08:09.160]  A big thank you.
[08:09.160 --> 08:10.160]  Shout out to Miss Mel.
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.160]  How about a giant?
[08:11.160 --> 08:12.160]  Thank you.
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.160]  Shout out to Todd K.
[08:13.720 --> 08:14.720]  A big thank you.
[08:14.720 --> 08:16.320]  Shout out to our friend, Glenn Geroni.
[08:16.320 --> 08:17.480]  I want to send a big thank you.
[08:17.480 --> 08:18.480]  Shout out to JM.
[08:18.480 --> 08:22.440]  I always want to send a big thank you to our buddy, James Brown, the hardest working man
[08:22.440 --> 08:23.920]  in cannabis.
[08:23.920 --> 08:25.400]  Also a big giant shout out to Keith K.
[08:25.400 --> 08:26.400]  Always.
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.120]  We got to send a huge giant shout out to our friend Fat Rabbit.
[08:30.120 --> 08:31.520]  That is the coolest name ever.
[08:31.520 --> 08:33.520]  Also a giant shout out and a thank you to Zoso J.
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.440]  You're going to look sharp in that Grow From Your Heart podcast for that iRegenetics hoodie.
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.200]  And last but certainly not least, I want to send a huge thank you to our buddy, Willie's
[08:42.240 --> 08:43.240]  armpit.
[08:43.240 --> 08:46.040]  Of course, one of the most creative names I've seen in a minute.
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.040]  Big shout out.
[08:47.040 --> 08:50.800]  Big thank you to everybody who continues to support the podcast.

[08:56.600 --> 08:58.760]  slash growfromyourheart.
[08:58.760 --> 09:03.000]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[09:03.000 --> 09:06.200]  I've got a couple of things I want to cover in this podcast, but Clint and I are having
[09:06.200 --> 09:07.200]  a lot of fun.
[09:07.200 --> 09:09.840]  So who knows if we will even get to it.
[09:09.840 --> 09:12.600]  Let's talk about what we got to do last night, bro.
[09:12.600 --> 09:13.600]  Yeah, buddy.
[09:13.600 --> 09:14.600]  Hey, real quick.
[09:14.600 --> 09:16.240]  Dude, those hoodies are tight.
[09:16.240 --> 09:17.560]  Those hoodies smooth looking or what?
[09:17.560 --> 09:18.560]  Yeah, dude.
[09:18.560 --> 09:19.560]  Nice and bright on the front.
[09:19.560 --> 09:20.560]  Nice and warm.
[09:20.560 --> 09:23.120]  People notice when I wear those everywhere we go, people are like, that's a dope hoodie,
[09:23.120 --> 09:24.120]  bro.
[09:24.120 --> 09:25.120]  So thank you, man.
[09:25.120 --> 09:26.120]  Thanks for the compliments.
[09:26.120 --> 09:27.120]  For sure.
[09:27.120 --> 09:28.120]  Our friends look sharp in those.
[09:28.120 --> 09:29.440]  There are a few left and this wasn't supposed to be a commercial.
[09:29.440 --> 09:31.080]  So good segue, good plug.
[09:31.080 --> 09:35.280]  You can get them on my website, iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[09:35.280 --> 09:36.320]  Click on the store.
[09:36.320 --> 09:39.040]  I know the website doesn't look very professional at this point.
[09:39.240 --> 09:40.240]  It's being rebuilt.
[09:40.240 --> 09:41.240]  We will relaunch that.
[09:41.240 --> 09:43.200]  New things are coming in 2020.
[09:43.200 --> 09:44.200]  But there is a web store.
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.560]  You can get a hoodie, go get a t-shirt, support the show, support iRegenetics, support.
[09:48.560 --> 09:49.560]  That's the bottom line there.
[09:49.560 --> 09:50.600]  Thank you guys for all the support.
[09:50.600 --> 09:54.560]  I know that without the iRi Army, without the Grow From Your Heart crew, that this wouldn't
[09:54.560 --> 09:55.560]  be a thing.
[09:55.560 --> 09:56.560]  So big up.
[09:56.560 --> 09:57.560]  Thank you guys.
[09:57.560 --> 09:58.560]  Hell yeah.
[09:58.560 --> 09:59.560]  Much respect.
[09:59.560 --> 10:00.560]  Thank you.
[10:00.560 --> 10:01.560]  I appreciate it.
[10:01.560 --> 10:02.560]  Yeah, join the club, boys.
[10:02.560 --> 10:03.560]  Join the club.
[10:03.560 --> 10:04.560]  That's the way to do it.
[10:04.560 --> 10:05.720]  So if you guys listen to the show frequently, and even if you don't, you'll learn right
[10:05.720 --> 10:08.360]  now, I am a huge fan of comedy.
[10:08.680 --> 10:09.680]  I like to laugh.
[10:09.680 --> 10:10.680]  I think laughter is medicine.
[10:10.680 --> 10:15.080]  Smoke cannabis and get told a joke, and you'll forget you even got problems.
[10:15.080 --> 10:17.800]  You'll just be too busy laughing, and it feels good.
[10:17.800 --> 10:18.800]  It recharges your soul.
[10:18.800 --> 10:23.120]  Of course, you got to deal with your problems appropriately, but sometimes you got to just,
[10:23.120 --> 10:24.760]  it helps the problems in your mind a little bit.
[10:24.760 --> 10:25.760]  Did you hear that through the microphone?
[10:25.760 --> 10:27.120]  When I tapped my head, it came through my mouth.
[10:27.120 --> 10:28.120]  I'm hollow.
[10:28.120 --> 10:32.320]  That's pretty cool.
[10:32.320 --> 10:33.320]  What note do I play?
[10:33.320 --> 10:34.320]  We'll find out later.
[10:34.320 --> 10:36.440]  But I think laughter is good for you.
[10:36.440 --> 10:40.200]  I also think it's good to take your friends to go see fucking laughter also.
[10:40.200 --> 10:46.200]  And I got to go see, we got to go see the fine gentleman of Who's Live Anyway, which
[10:46.200 --> 10:51.240]  is the live version of Whose Line Is It Anyway from TV.
[10:51.240 --> 10:52.800]  I'm sure a lot of people know what that is.
[10:52.800 --> 10:55.000]  It's on CW is what he said.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.240]  It's been on for years on different channels.
[10:57.240 --> 11:01.400]  It was not the tall guy, not the black guy, and not Drew Carey is one of the jokes they
[11:01.400 --> 11:02.720]  tell you a lot.
[11:03.080 --> 11:07.480]  It was Mr. Greg Proops, who if you listen, you know, that's one of my favorite comedians.
[11:07.480 --> 11:10.080]  Yeah, he was so funny last night too.
[11:10.080 --> 11:13.000]  He kind of works as a very gracious host of the show.
[11:13.000 --> 11:15.640]  He's got very good hosting skills.
[11:15.640 --> 11:20.840]  There's also a comedian known as Jeff B. Davis, a younger guy who fits in very well with the
[11:20.840 --> 11:21.840]  improv group.
[11:21.840 --> 11:22.840]  He's got a lot of energy.
[11:22.840 --> 11:25.600]  He brings a lot of energy and creativity and movement to the group.
[11:25.600 --> 11:27.120]  Yeah, he really worked hard.
[11:27.120 --> 11:28.640]  He did really well.
[11:28.640 --> 11:29.960]  And he's got to bring that younger energy.
[11:29.960 --> 11:32.800]  I'm not saying the other guys are old cats, but they're not spring chickens.
[11:32.800 --> 11:33.960]  They're older dudes.
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.080]  And so to have Jeff B. Davis bring that young energy is really a good thing for the show.
[11:38.080 --> 11:42.960]  Yeah, to some really like experienced improv guys was really cool.
[11:42.960 --> 11:45.920]  And then there's a guy named Joel Murray, who is really funny.
[11:45.920 --> 11:48.240]  He does a lot of great voices, a lot of good character.
[11:48.240 --> 11:49.240]  Oh, yeah.
[11:49.240 --> 11:51.880]  A lot of a lot of good, slightly dry humor.
[11:51.880 --> 11:55.040]  Yeah, he kind of has a Bob Newhart sort of a delivery to it.
[11:55.040 --> 11:56.040]  He really did.
[11:56.040 --> 11:58.040]  Yeah, I didn't think about that.
[11:58.360 --> 12:02.120]  He really played like the dad almost on stage.
[12:02.120 --> 12:03.120]  Just the smart ass.
[12:03.120 --> 12:06.560]  Like if it got too funny, he'd have one comment just to shut you down.
[12:06.560 --> 12:08.960]  Yeah, he didn't say a lot.
[12:08.960 --> 12:11.200]  It was just what he said was correct.
[12:11.200 --> 12:12.200]  It's beautiful.
[12:12.200 --> 12:16.320]  Then there's another guy that some people may have heard of a guy named his name is
[12:16.320 --> 12:17.320]  Dave Foley.
[12:17.320 --> 12:18.320]  Dave Foley.
[12:18.320 --> 12:19.320]  Dave Foley.
[12:19.320 --> 12:20.320]  He's fucking hilarious.
[12:20.320 --> 12:22.560]  That guy's got a lot of character.
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.560]  Snazzy dresser.
[12:23.560 --> 12:24.560]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:24.560 --> 12:27.000]  They were all pretty well dressed last night.
[12:27.000 --> 12:31.560]  That's one of Greg Proops's themes is how do we dress as sharp as possible?
[12:31.560 --> 12:33.440]  That's one of his mottos all the time.
[12:33.440 --> 12:35.640]  So they've of course look good.
[12:35.640 --> 12:38.840]  And it would be rude to overlook a very crucial member of the group.
[12:38.840 --> 12:44.280]  They have a musician whose name who has escaped my head right now, but he brings a grand piano
[12:44.280 --> 12:47.080]  and a keyboard and a couple of other small instruments.
[12:47.080 --> 12:50.240]  And he provides the musical soundtrack for the evening.
[12:50.240 --> 12:52.680]  And without him, it wouldn't be a show.
[12:52.680 --> 12:53.680]  That guy is amazing.
[12:53.680 --> 12:54.760]  He's a great musician.
[12:54.760 --> 12:56.720]  They do improv songs.
[12:57.440 --> 12:59.480]  He provides background music and sound effects.
[12:59.480 --> 13:01.640]  And he is spot on.
[13:01.640 --> 13:04.800]  People often forget about that guy in the back making the music.
[13:04.800 --> 13:07.760]  He needs a special acknowledgement because he's fucking awesome.
[13:07.760 --> 13:08.760]  Yeah.
[13:08.760 --> 13:09.760]  What an amazing talent.
[13:09.760 --> 13:11.120]  Yeah, just did.
[13:11.120 --> 13:15.960]  They're doing an improv show and the audience member is yelling out steps to the improv.
[13:15.960 --> 13:18.960]  And so yeah, the improv guys, and I'm not downplaying them.
[13:18.960 --> 13:19.960]  They've got to do improv.
[13:19.960 --> 13:22.600]  They've got to make it funny physically and verbally.
[13:22.600 --> 13:24.720]  This guy's got to make it funny musically.
[13:24.720 --> 13:27.520]  He's got to take your idea and make music to it.
[13:27.520 --> 13:28.520]  Yeah.
[13:28.520 --> 13:31.200]  He's got to give it like a contrament.
[13:31.200 --> 13:32.200]  Look at you, bro.
[13:32.200 --> 13:33.200]  You're bringing out big words for the show.
[13:33.200 --> 13:34.840]  Oh, like a company man.
[13:34.840 --> 13:35.840]  Yeah.
[13:35.840 --> 13:37.400]  He's just like pushing it ahead.
[13:37.400 --> 13:38.400]  Yes.
[13:38.400 --> 13:39.400]  It's good.
[13:39.400 --> 13:40.400]  I mean, he just he made the show.
[13:40.400 --> 13:41.400]  Really?
[13:41.400 --> 13:43.920]  He's doing the score and the sound effects at the same time.
[13:43.920 --> 13:45.880]  Basically, I remember they said he was from Edmonton.
[13:45.880 --> 13:46.880]  Yeah.
[13:46.880 --> 13:49.520]  He's won a bunch of awards for something, a big thing in Canada.
[13:49.520 --> 13:53.200]  And I hate to be disrespectful like that, but he's definitely well known in Canada.
[13:53.200 --> 13:56.880]  Of course, I was plenty stoned because we were going to a funny comedy show.
[13:56.880 --> 14:01.040]  The last thing I was thinking about was remembering people's names, but he deserves some acknowledgement.
[14:01.040 --> 14:02.520]  He's a great fucking musician.
[14:02.520 --> 14:07.720]  If the Who's Live Anyway tour is coming to your neighborhood, I highly recommend you
[14:07.720 --> 14:09.360]  highly go and go highly.
[14:09.360 --> 14:10.360]  Yeah.
[14:10.360 --> 14:11.360]  It's a good funny show.
[14:11.360 --> 14:12.360]  Definitely get baked and go.
[14:12.360 --> 14:13.360]  It's fun.
[14:13.360 --> 14:14.360]  Yes.
[14:14.360 --> 14:15.360]  Yes.
[14:15.360 --> 14:17.560]  And big shout out to Jeff B. Davis.
[14:17.560 --> 14:19.360]  A big shout out to Joel Mare.
[14:19.360 --> 14:21.840]  Of course, a giant shout out to Mr. Dave Foley.
[14:21.840 --> 14:25.120]  Shout out to the musician guy who, man, I feel rude for not remembering his name, but
[14:25.120 --> 14:26.120]  he was fucking great.
[14:26.120 --> 14:28.800]  It was at Second City in Toronto is where he's famous from.
[14:28.800 --> 14:30.200]  That word just popped into my brain.
[14:30.200 --> 14:31.200]  Nice.
[14:31.200 --> 14:33.280]  But I want to send a big shout out to our friend, Greg Proops.
[14:33.280 --> 14:36.240]  I feel like we've met Proops a couple of times.
[14:36.240 --> 14:39.000]  Proops interacts with myself on Twitter quite frequently.
[14:39.000 --> 14:42.960]  He calls me Young Dabber is the name he has assigned to me, which I think is fucking funny.
[14:42.960 --> 14:43.960]  Which is perfect.
[14:43.960 --> 14:44.960]  It fits, bro.
[14:44.960 --> 14:47.400]  If the dab fits, I'll hit it.
[14:48.040 --> 14:52.480]  We may or may not have known exactly where Proops was going to be moments after the show,
[14:52.480 --> 14:54.440]  and we may or may not have approached him.
[14:54.440 --> 14:58.600]  He was completely kind to us, and he thanked us for coming.
[14:58.600 --> 15:00.320]  We got to shake Proops' hand.
[15:00.320 --> 15:03.680]  I feel like we're on a friendly basis with Proops, so it's really cool to go see him.
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.520]  He is very gracious when he sees us.
[15:05.520 --> 15:07.240]  He's such a polite man.
[15:07.240 --> 15:10.520]  Oh, so you shake your hand and just be polite.
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.760]  Man, what a great guy.
[15:12.760 --> 15:13.760]  Yeah.
[15:13.760 --> 15:15.160]  I know we're kissing his ass a little bit.
[15:15.160 --> 15:17.200]  I just enjoyed the show a whole bunch.
[15:18.000 --> 15:19.400]  It was just yesterday, so it was so fresh.
[15:19.400 --> 15:21.000]  It was just great.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.280]  I keep telling everybody, I took Clint to a comedy show, and we had a good time, and
[15:24.280 --> 15:25.960]  I give you a shout out there.
[15:25.960 --> 15:27.520]  You're like, hey, bro, you want to dab tonight?
[15:27.520 --> 15:28.520]  I was like, I got to record.
[15:28.520 --> 15:29.880]  I was like, oh, wait, I know what to do.
[15:29.880 --> 15:30.880]  Oh, damn.
[15:30.880 --> 15:33.880]  We'll put a microphone in front of Clint and make a show out of this.
[15:33.880 --> 15:34.880]  Yeah.
[15:34.880 --> 15:37.320]  Man, thanks for being a fucking awesome road dog on the comedy show thing.
[15:37.320 --> 15:38.480]  It's been fun with you every time.
[15:38.480 --> 15:40.800]  Dude, we've had some really good times lately.
[15:40.800 --> 15:42.520]  It has been fantastic.
[15:42.520 --> 15:45.040]  We've seen Joey, Bernard Schaub.
[15:45.040 --> 15:46.040]  Joe.
[15:46.040 --> 15:47.040]  Joe Diaz.
[15:47.880 --> 15:48.880]  Joe Rogan.
[15:48.880 --> 15:49.880]  Joe Rogan.
[15:49.880 --> 15:50.880]  Joe Diaz.
[15:50.880 --> 15:51.880]  Brennan Schaub.
[15:51.880 --> 15:52.880]  Tommy Bonds.
[15:52.880 --> 15:53.880]  Tom Segura.
[15:53.880 --> 15:55.440]  And then we saw Who's Alive.
[15:55.440 --> 15:57.480]  We've done quite a few cool comedy shows lately.
[15:57.480 --> 15:58.680]  Yeah, it's been really good.
[15:58.680 --> 16:00.160]  We got to see Derek Poston.
[16:00.160 --> 16:01.840]  Oh, that was great.
[16:01.840 --> 16:02.840]  Ahsan Ahmad.
[16:02.840 --> 16:04.080]  I was saying his name wrong, you guys.
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.880]  I was saying, well, he put a J in his name in Instagram and Twitter, and so I was saying
[16:07.880 --> 16:09.520]  the J, but that's like his middle name.
[16:09.520 --> 16:13.320]  So it's Ahsan Ahmad, I think, and I was calling him Ahsanj, just because that's what it says
[16:13.320 --> 16:14.640]  on fucking Instagram.
[16:14.640 --> 16:15.640]  I apologize, bro.
[16:16.240 --> 16:17.240]  That's all right.
[16:17.240 --> 16:18.240]  You're trying.
[16:18.240 --> 16:19.720]  You're trying to shout people out.
[16:19.720 --> 16:23.600]  Anybody that looked him up on Instagram found him because of the way I had pronounced it,
[16:23.600 --> 16:25.480]  because they put the J in there, because I was saying it.
[16:25.480 --> 16:27.360]  I'm glad they did, because that guy is funny.
[16:27.360 --> 16:29.120]  He's fucking funny, and he's blowing up too.
[16:29.120 --> 16:30.120]  But Derek Poston.
[16:30.120 --> 16:31.120]  Derek.
[16:31.120 --> 16:32.120]  Oh, that was so fun.
[16:32.120 --> 16:35.120]  Very unexpected and very, very worth my ticket price.
[16:35.120 --> 16:39.800]  He blew the roof off the place, blew my mind, and I'm glad I got to see him, because now
[16:39.800 --> 16:40.800]  I'm a big fan.
[16:40.800 --> 16:41.800]  And then got to meet him after the show.
[16:41.800 --> 16:42.800]  Yeah.
[16:42.800 --> 16:43.800]  He was just like, what's up, man?
[16:43.800 --> 16:44.800]  I was like, you're fucking funny.
[16:44.960 --> 16:45.960]  I was like, yeah, that's what I do.
[16:45.960 --> 16:46.960]  Thank you.
[16:46.960 --> 16:47.960]  Yeah.
[16:47.960 --> 16:48.960]  Like, you're just humble and want to hang out.
[16:48.960 --> 16:49.960]  I like that.
[16:49.960 --> 16:50.960]  Yeah, they were just so chill.
[16:50.960 --> 16:54.680]  And it's, I don't know, man, all these comedians that have come through have just been so nice.
[16:54.680 --> 16:58.840]  You know, we meet Shaw, we meet Proops again.
[16:58.840 --> 17:03.360]  And like, we've hung out with Proops for like an hour, you know, probably.
[17:03.360 --> 17:04.360]  Proops assaulted me.
[17:04.360 --> 17:05.360]  Yeah, I know.
[17:05.360 --> 17:06.360]  That was bad.
[17:06.360 --> 17:07.360]  He's telling this story.
[17:07.360 --> 17:11.160]  Proops is like holding court and telling this story.
[17:11.160 --> 17:14.440]  And it's just me and Jeff and like two other people hanging out.
[17:15.080 --> 17:16.080]  And Ngayo was there.
[17:16.080 --> 17:17.080]  And that was great.
[17:17.080 --> 17:18.080]  And Ngayo Beelum was hanging out.
[17:18.080 --> 17:19.960]  So like, we're just all just chilling.
[17:19.960 --> 17:24.360]  And it's like just this real secluded little area that we found.
[17:24.360 --> 17:28.520]  And man, he's telling this story and it's something about baseball.
[17:28.520 --> 17:33.360]  And all of a sudden, Jeff gets hit across the chest like a Ric Flair chop.
[17:33.360 --> 17:34.840]  He tagged me that I was out.
[17:34.840 --> 17:38.480]  And the story about, because anybody that knows Proops knows he's a baseball fan.
[17:38.480 --> 17:39.480]  That's right.
[17:39.480 --> 17:40.480]  He loves old baseball stories.
[17:40.480 --> 17:41.480]  And so he was stoned.
[17:41.480 --> 17:42.480]  We got him lit.
[17:42.520 --> 17:46.520]  And he's telling a story about baseball and he tagged me to express that the runner was
[17:46.520 --> 17:47.520]  out.
[17:47.520 --> 17:51.280]  And I was like, oh, he just I looked at Clint like Proops just slapped the shit out of me,
[17:51.280 --> 17:52.280]  dude.
[17:52.280 --> 17:54.080]  I almost had to step in like security guard.
[17:54.080 --> 17:55.440]  I was like, what was that?
[17:55.440 --> 17:59.040]  He knew that I was loving it because we were out there smoking him out and hanging out.
[17:59.040 --> 18:02.240]  So we'd been hanging out with him for like 45 minutes by that point.
[18:02.240 --> 18:06.160]  I mean, he's always been such a gentleman and such a great host.
[18:06.160 --> 18:11.480]  So there's a great thing about that comedian personality.
[18:11.480 --> 18:17.440]  There's a need for attention and the thing that once you've got an audience, you don't
[18:17.440 --> 18:19.000]  want to let it go.
[18:19.000 --> 18:22.880]  And so if we find them at the right time and they're still in that pocket, they just keep
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.200]  going for us.
[18:24.200 --> 18:28.600]  And when they see us and that club knows who I am.
[18:28.600 --> 18:32.920]  And so I may be given special treatment and get special access to people.
[18:32.920 --> 18:36.360]  But once they meet us and they calm down and they start smoking, they realize these guys
[18:36.360 --> 18:37.360]  are harmless.
[18:37.360 --> 18:38.720]  They're not like sketchy fans.
[18:38.720 --> 18:40.960]  They're not going to ask us to sign their ass cheeks.
[18:40.960 --> 18:42.680]  We're not even asking for pictures.
[18:42.680 --> 18:43.680]  I don't even know.
[18:43.680 --> 18:44.680]  I'm over getting paid.
[18:44.680 --> 18:48.000]  I've hung out with Doug eight times recently and there's no photos anywhere of it just
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.720]  because there's no need for that.
[18:49.720 --> 18:54.400]  Well, you get to a certain like mentality and you just realize like, yeah, dude, I'm
[18:54.400 --> 18:56.240]  enjoying this for this moment right now.
[18:56.240 --> 18:57.240]  It's in my brain.
[18:57.240 --> 18:58.240]  I know it happened.
[18:58.240 --> 18:59.240]  And Doug knows it happened.
[18:59.240 --> 19:02.920]  And yeah, so I kind of got out there when we meet these people.
[19:02.920 --> 19:06.200]  Once you get them going, you smoke a bowl with them or two and then you don't get weird
[19:06.200 --> 19:09.640]  on them and they get comfortable with you and they're at a comedy club and they're safe
[19:09.640 --> 19:12.360]  zone and the comedy club is kind of confirmed that we're cool.
[19:12.360 --> 19:13.360]  You know what I mean?
[19:13.360 --> 19:14.600]  We've been given that, Hey, those guys are all right.
[19:14.600 --> 19:15.600]  Yeah.
[19:15.600 --> 19:19.680]  They chill out and they give you, they can't stop doing the thing.
[19:19.680 --> 19:21.240]  Like they're still in a spotlight.
[19:21.240 --> 19:24.120]  They're still waiting to be told the show, the other show is over and that's the show
[19:24.120 --> 19:27.760]  that they're just performing in life today because I don't know, just that personality
[19:27.760 --> 19:29.400]  type has a need for attention.
[19:29.400 --> 19:32.840]  Most of the comedians, all their lives, they're just trying to get someone to fucking pay
[19:32.840 --> 19:36.560]  attention and now we are like, oh, I'll talk until you're fucking done.
[19:36.560 --> 19:37.560]  Yeah.
[19:37.560 --> 19:40.880]  I get to like hanging out with Joey Diaz for that hour.
[19:40.880 --> 19:45.280]  We got to hang out with him and him giving me comedy advice back in the day.
[19:45.280 --> 19:51.160]  Like those were just like ingrained in me and cause I'm such a fan boy, you know?
[19:51.160 --> 19:56.040]  So it's, it's some of that, like it's, it's just exciting to like kind of meet your heroes
[19:56.040 --> 19:57.480]  and they like are tight.
[19:57.480 --> 19:58.760]  To watch Joey talk.
[19:58.760 --> 20:01.080]  I usually I'm the mouthy one.
[20:01.080 --> 20:04.480]  I know that I'm the one that can just walk my way into a situation.
[20:04.480 --> 20:06.100]  I'm not shy to walk up.
[20:06.100 --> 20:08.780]  If they're not going to shoot me, I could walk up to the president casually and be like,
[20:08.780 --> 20:09.780]  what's up bro?
[20:09.780 --> 20:11.100]  I'm Ross DeGeff and stick out my hand and shake man.
[20:11.100 --> 20:12.260]  I don't care if you're the president.
[20:12.260 --> 20:13.820]  I don't care if you're the janitor.
[20:13.820 --> 20:14.820]  I'm not shy.
[20:14.820 --> 20:15.820]  We're going to be friends.
[20:15.820 --> 20:16.820]  I'll walk up and talk to you.
[20:16.820 --> 20:17.820]  Yeah, we'll share a joint no matter who you are.
[20:17.820 --> 20:18.820]  Yeah.
[20:18.820 --> 20:21.980]  So I'm usually the one that's like kind of dominating the conversation sometimes purposely,
[20:21.980 --> 20:23.800]  sometimes not to tell you the truth.
[20:23.800 --> 20:28.900]  So when we go to meet these famous people, I know how to be comfortable and make a conversation
[20:28.900 --> 20:30.260]  happen and be casual.
[20:30.260 --> 20:35.140]  And you generally stand a little bit to the back and let the conversation go and you talk
[20:35.180 --> 20:38.100]  when it's necessary and let me run my face.
[20:38.100 --> 20:40.700]  Joey decided you said I'm a standup comedian.
[20:40.700 --> 20:42.700]  And Joey was like, oh yeah, fuck this guy with dreadlocks.
[20:42.700 --> 20:46.500]  I knew I was like me step back into this shadow.
[20:46.500 --> 20:49.500]  That was a tight moment.
[20:49.500 --> 20:54.140]  And like I just stood back and let you and I watched you and Joey Diaz have a conversation.
[20:54.140 --> 20:57.460]  There's a light right between you guys just shining on both of your faces.
[20:57.460 --> 20:58.620]  And I just stood back.
[20:58.620 --> 21:02.340]  I had a health stone pipe with hash in it and I just sat there and hit a bowl a couple
[21:02.340 --> 21:06.060]  of times and just chilled out and watch Joey tell you he laid it down, bro.
[21:06.060 --> 21:10.180]  I remember what he told you right every day and he goes, I don't care what you write.
[21:10.180 --> 21:11.820]  I'm right every day.
[21:11.820 --> 21:14.220]  I don't care if you write your name across the page a thousand times.
[21:14.220 --> 21:16.100]  Don't spend an hour writing every fucking day.
[21:16.100 --> 21:17.100]  Cocksucker.
[21:17.100 --> 21:18.100]  Yeah.
[21:18.100 --> 21:19.100]  Yep.
[21:19.100 --> 21:20.100]  Yep.
[21:20.100 --> 21:21.460]  And he was fucking, I think that's part of the part of the key, but yeah, just to get
[21:21.460 --> 21:24.500]  those magical moments and to watch him tell you that and just to sit back, it was kind
[21:24.500 --> 21:25.500]  of cool.
[21:25.500 --> 21:29.380]  I wish I would have had the balls to take out my phone and snap a shot for you, but
[21:29.380 --> 21:30.860]  that's all good, brother.
[21:30.860 --> 21:31.860]  We got it in our memories.
[21:32.380 --> 21:33.380]  Yeah.
[21:33.380 --> 21:34.380]  It's the best place.
[21:34.380 --> 21:35.380]  It would have made it uncomfortable.
[21:35.380 --> 21:36.380]  It would have broken all of the magic.
[21:36.380 --> 21:38.180]  I think the phone would have ruined all of the magic at that time.
[21:38.180 --> 21:43.900]  I felt like we kind of just had like a, I don't know, there's like almost a social like
[21:43.900 --> 21:47.380]  barrier there where it's just like, dude, we're just fucking hanging out.
[21:47.380 --> 21:50.780]  And that's part of why they let us do that, bro, because we don't ever fan boy out and
[21:50.780 --> 21:52.260]  pull out our dicks or our phones.
[21:52.260 --> 21:53.540]  They just let us go.
[21:53.540 --> 21:55.340]  No, we're just trying to hand them weed.
[21:55.340 --> 21:57.940]  It's like, Hey man, let's smoke.
[21:57.940 --> 22:01.980]  I'll tell him my secret that every comedian that comes through, he gets to get fucking
[22:01.980 --> 22:03.420]  stoned with Rasta Jeff.
[22:03.420 --> 22:08.340]  That's well, when comedians do what they do, brother, you want to talk about cannabis or
[22:08.340 --> 22:09.980]  should we just have fun in this episode?
[22:09.980 --> 22:10.980]  Let's do both.
[22:10.980 --> 22:11.980]  We've been having fun.
[22:11.980 --> 22:12.980]  Let's talk about cannabis.
[22:12.980 --> 22:15.540]  The next thing I've got listed here on my paper is the endo expo is coming.
[22:15.540 --> 22:18.460]  A lot of people have been asking when is the next big event?
[22:18.460 --> 22:24.260]  The endo expo, January 25th and 26th in Denver, Colorado with the Denver Mart.
[22:24.260 --> 22:30.660]  The 25th is industry day, which means you've got to get an industry invite pass.
[22:30.660 --> 22:35.500]  The 26th is general public day, which means you are able to attend.
[22:35.500 --> 22:36.820]  Everybody can attend.
[22:36.820 --> 22:37.900]  There is a link you have.
[22:37.900 --> 22:42.100]  If you go to the endo expo website, this is for the Denver endo expo that I'm talking
[22:42.100 --> 22:43.100]  about.
[22:43.100 --> 22:44.100]  I'll be at the Denver endo expo.
[22:44.100 --> 22:46.900]  If you'd like to come to the booth, come shake my hand.
[22:46.900 --> 22:51.540]  Come tell me if you love or hate the podcast, maybe pick up some cool IRIE genetics merchandise.
[22:51.540 --> 22:52.540]  Just come say hi.
[22:52.540 --> 22:56.620]  If you want to check out the endo expo in Denver, Colorado, let me warn you that is
[22:56.620 --> 22:59.200]  a non-consumption event.
[22:59.200 --> 23:04.300]  You cannot consume any sort of cannabis or buy or sell or trade cannabis in there.
[23:04.300 --> 23:06.540]  It is a cannabis trade show.
[23:06.540 --> 23:13.980]  It's one of the world's largest indoor cannabis trade shows, indoor grow based cannabis trade
[23:13.980 --> 23:14.980]  shows.
[23:14.980 --> 23:18.380]  There's an entire CBD and hemp indoor pavilion.
[23:18.380 --> 23:22.820]  They call it the indoor hemp pavilion where they've got a bunch of CBD vendors teaching
[23:22.820 --> 23:24.860]  about CBD.
[23:24.860 --> 23:29.460]  They actually do give away CBD samples because it's anything without THC they can give away,
[23:29.460 --> 23:32.660]  they can share with you, but nothing with THC they can share or give away.
[23:32.660 --> 23:35.580]  That's just dispensary and Colorado state regulations.
[23:35.580 --> 23:38.280]  You can check out all kinds of nutrient companies.
[23:38.280 --> 23:39.680]  You can check out lighting companies.
[23:39.680 --> 23:44.740]  There will be tons of seed companies there if you need to refill your genetic stash.
[23:44.740 --> 23:47.980]  The endo expo is a great opportunity for things like that.
[23:48.580 --> 23:49.580]  Also, you can meet the industry.
[23:49.580 --> 23:56.620]  Also, if you plan properly and you do it properly, bring a bag and you can fill that bag with
[23:56.620 --> 23:57.780]  excellent freebies.
[23:57.780 --> 24:02.620]  You can get soil, you can get nutrients, you can get shirts, stickers, hats.
[24:02.620 --> 24:07.140]  You can get a fresh outfit for the entire year if you want to rock out whatever company
[24:07.140 --> 24:09.780]  you like, probably an iRegenetics t-shirt.
[24:09.780 --> 24:11.300]  Maybe you could get a new millennium t-shirt.
[24:11.300 --> 24:13.580]  Maybe you can get a Veg Bloom t-shirt.
[24:13.580 --> 24:16.060]  Just go visit all your favorite vendors, talk to them.
[24:16.060 --> 24:18.220]  They're giving out free merchandise.
[24:18.220 --> 24:19.300]  That's a huge free commercial.
[24:19.300 --> 24:22.420]  I just wanted to invite people to come fucking hang out at the iRee booth and say what's
[24:22.420 --> 24:23.940]  up to iRegenetics at the event.
[24:23.940 --> 24:24.940]  It's a huge event too.
[24:24.940 --> 24:25.940]  It's a huge event.
[24:25.940 --> 24:26.940]  They need to start getting tickets now.
[24:26.940 --> 24:29.340]  That's awesome that you're in that, man.
[24:29.340 --> 24:30.340]  That's so cool.
[24:30.340 --> 24:31.340]  Thank you, man.
[24:31.340 --> 24:32.340]  It's fun to finally have stepped up.
[24:32.340 --> 24:33.700]  Last year, I shared a booth with other folks.
[24:33.700 --> 24:37.580]  I was invited to be part of the Oregon Elite Seeds team.
[24:37.580 --> 24:40.780]  No offense to them, but the endo expo reached out and they said, hey, you're a local.
[24:40.780 --> 24:41.780]  You're a Colorado boy.
[24:41.780 --> 24:43.260]  We love having the hometown heroes here.
[24:43.260 --> 24:44.260]  Would you like to have a booth?
[24:44.260 --> 24:45.260]  That's what I said.
[24:45.460 --> 24:46.460]  I said, hell yes, I would.
[24:46.460 --> 24:48.540]  So they gave me the, I paid the normal price for it.
[24:48.540 --> 24:51.140]  I'm not going to say that they gave me any special deal, but they reached out and said,
[24:51.140 --> 24:52.140]  we want the Colorado boy.
[24:52.140 --> 24:53.140]  Are you ready to do it?
[24:53.140 --> 24:54.140]  I said, fuck yes, I am.
[24:54.140 --> 24:55.140]  Hell yeah.
[24:55.140 --> 24:56.140]  So I've got a full 10 by 10 booth.
[24:56.140 --> 24:57.540]  I got the booth ready to go.
[24:57.540 --> 25:00.060]  There'll be a lot of great things available at the booth.
[25:00.060 --> 25:02.060]  So yeah, that's my commercial for that.
[25:02.060 --> 25:03.060]  Come say what's up.
[25:03.060 --> 25:04.300]  Yeah, definitely come say what's up.
[25:04.300 --> 25:07.180]  I'm the tall white guy with dreadlocks at the iRegenetics booth.
[25:07.180 --> 25:09.220]  I'm trying to get white Mike to be able to attend.
[25:09.220 --> 25:13.340]  He does have two children and a family and a lot of things going on that time of year.
[25:13.420 --> 25:17.340]  25th and 26th of January, Indio Expo.
[25:17.340 --> 25:18.340]  Come on down.
[25:18.340 --> 25:19.340]  We want to see you there.
[25:19.340 --> 25:24.900]  All right, let's get a little more serious because in a previous episode, I may have
[25:24.900 --> 25:28.340]  said something that was not a hundred percent accurate.
[25:28.340 --> 25:31.420]  It wasn't a huge mistake, but it's good.
[25:31.420 --> 25:33.420]  I like, I don't like making mistakes.
[25:33.420 --> 25:35.100]  I like learning from my mistakes.
[25:35.100 --> 25:40.620]  I like that I've got a really good community, the iRe Army, the Grow From Your Heart crew.
[25:40.620 --> 25:45.500]  Not only did they support us well on Patreon, but also they reached out and politely said,
[25:45.500 --> 25:50.700]  hey, you gave some kind of funky information on one of these episodes and it wasn't a major
[25:50.700 --> 25:51.700]  mistake.
[25:51.700 --> 25:53.260]  It's not going to kill anybody's plants.
[25:53.260 --> 25:59.020]  Honestly, I will admit that this is the area of growing and cannabis where I can use the
[25:59.020 --> 26:01.740]  most education and I am not afraid to admit that.
[26:01.740 --> 26:06.980]  I know a lot about most of, this is lighting and light spectrums, which is something that
[26:06.980 --> 26:08.460]  I know very minimal about.
[26:08.460 --> 26:11.780]  I should know more and I'm not ashamed to admit that.
[26:11.780 --> 26:14.500]  I know about plants like a motherfucker.
[26:14.500 --> 26:15.500]  I know about breeding.
[26:15.500 --> 26:16.500]  I know about selection.
[26:16.500 --> 26:19.540]  I can look at your plants and tell you what's wrong with their nutrients.
[26:19.540 --> 26:20.580]  I can tell you a lot of things.
[26:20.580 --> 26:22.540]  When it comes to lighting, I am a little ignorant.
[26:22.540 --> 26:27.060]  I need to read more books on that and I'm not shy to admit that, but luckily I said
[26:27.060 --> 26:30.860]  something that indicated straight up I'm fucking full of shit when it comes to talking about
[26:30.860 --> 26:34.940]  lighting because some of our friends stepped up and said, Rasta Jeff, first off, you're
[26:34.940 --> 26:36.100]  a little bit wrong.
[26:36.420 --> 26:39.740]  Then they helped me out and they said, here's the information that you need.
[26:39.740 --> 26:41.860]  So big shout out to all of my friends who helped me out.
[26:41.860 --> 26:45.540]  When I start reading this, one of our friends will say, ha ha, he took my information.
[26:45.540 --> 26:52.660]  So in a previous episode, I kind of said that the sun changes color as it sets and that
[26:52.660 --> 26:58.140]  color from the sun creates a different spectrum that helps the plants go to sleep.
[26:58.140 --> 27:01.060]  The sun does not change colors.
[27:01.060 --> 27:02.060]  That's true.
[27:02.060 --> 27:03.060]  That is true.
[27:03.060 --> 27:05.740]  I honestly hadn't done, I didn't write any notes for that.
[27:06.380 --> 27:08.860]  I was reading that question and was just answering it from my knowledge.
[27:08.860 --> 27:10.800]  And I said that the sun changes colors.
[27:10.800 --> 27:12.420]  It may look like it changes colors.
[27:12.420 --> 27:14.100]  That is not what happens.
[27:14.100 --> 27:20.460]  The atmosphere filters the light based on the angle of the sun in a comparison to where
[27:20.460 --> 27:22.000]  we are seeing it.
[27:22.000 --> 27:23.900]  So it doesn't change colors.
[27:23.900 --> 27:29.020]  It's basically a filter because imagine if you held a light bulb right above your head,
[27:29.020 --> 27:31.900]  it's going to see bright here and you're going to get that other color of light down here
[27:31.900 --> 27:34.660]  and then you move it and the light's going to shine differently.
[27:34.660 --> 27:38.980]  It's basically in the atmosphere like if you, when it's foggy, the fucking light shines
[27:38.980 --> 27:40.520]  differently because you can see it.
[27:40.520 --> 27:42.020]  That's the type of shit is going to change.
[27:42.020 --> 27:45.940]  And I completely, obviously you could tell I don't understand that concept fully.
[27:45.940 --> 27:47.700]  You can tell by the way I'm trying to explain it.
[27:47.700 --> 27:49.500]  Yeah, different spectrums of light.
[27:49.500 --> 27:50.500]  Yes.
[27:50.500 --> 27:55.020]  But that happens because of the angle of the sun, where you are and the atmosphere, it
[27:55.020 --> 27:56.740]  filters the light.
[27:56.740 --> 28:00.060]  So I just wanted to say I did that wrong and I'm not afraid to admit it.
[28:00.060 --> 28:03.820]  And thank you to my friend, Jesse James, for stepping up and correcting me.
[28:03.980 --> 28:07.540]  That means a lot to me that I've got a team that will politely say, Hey bro, you sound
[28:07.540 --> 28:08.540]  dumb.
[28:08.540 --> 28:09.540]  Hey bro.
[28:09.540 --> 28:10.540]  Yeah.
[28:10.540 --> 28:11.540]  Yeah.
[28:11.540 --> 28:12.540]  And I mean a lot of people are listening so we can't give out fake information.
[28:12.540 --> 28:13.540]  No.
[28:13.540 --> 28:15.060]  And you're willing to fucking make your mistakes and learn from them.
[28:15.060 --> 28:17.380]  You know, I've done a podcast all about making mistakes.
[28:17.380 --> 28:18.700]  So there's another one for you.
[28:18.700 --> 28:19.700]  Yeah.
[28:19.700 --> 28:21.380]  And also you guys, I'm not fucking bulletproof.
[28:21.380 --> 28:22.380]  I fuck up.
[28:22.380 --> 28:24.420]  I said some dumb shit and here I am saying I said some dumb shit.
[28:24.420 --> 28:25.420]  Sorry you guys.
[28:25.420 --> 28:26.420]  A lot of people rely on me.
[28:26.420 --> 28:30.500]  Well, you were close, you know, and I, I'm, it's not a plant thing.
[28:30.500 --> 28:31.580]  This is more of a.
[28:31.580 --> 28:37.220]  And so we were talking about far red spectrums and this is a spectrum that falls in the seven
[28:37.220 --> 28:39.220]  to 800 nanometer range.
[28:39.220 --> 28:45.660]  And there's a little bit of a debate on the internet on what range is ideal for the far
[28:45.660 --> 28:47.660]  red spectrum.
[28:47.660 --> 28:50.180]  Some people say it is seven to 800.
[28:50.180 --> 28:56.740]  I saw seven 30 to 800 and then more specifically people dial it into the seven 50 to seven
[28:56.740 --> 28:57.740]  80 range.
[28:57.740 --> 29:00.100]  But I've also seen people go up to eight 30.
[29:00.100 --> 29:04.820]  So there's a little bit of a debate where that red happens, which is most ideal for
[29:04.820 --> 29:05.820]  the cannabis plants.
[29:05.820 --> 29:08.780]  I feel you just like all lighting pretty much.
[29:08.780 --> 29:13.220]  It's probably possibly a phenotype dependent plant specific.
[29:13.220 --> 29:14.220]  I'll bet it is.
[29:14.220 --> 29:15.220]  Yeah.
[29:15.220 --> 29:16.220]  Yeah.
[29:16.220 --> 29:18.420]  Because I mean, we're, we're plants are from, they're going to want different light, right?
[29:18.420 --> 29:19.420]  Northern, Southern.
[29:19.420 --> 29:20.420]  Oh man.
[29:20.420 --> 29:21.420]  Yup.
[29:21.420 --> 29:22.420]  That's going to be all right.
[29:22.420 --> 29:25.060]  So that makes a big difference as to where your nanometers are going to be.
[29:25.060 --> 29:26.060]  Absolutely.
[29:26.060 --> 29:27.300]  I would agree with that.
[29:27.300 --> 29:28.340]  All right.
[29:28.340 --> 29:32.180]  So, uh, I think I corrected that big thanks to Jesse James for that.
[29:32.180 --> 29:34.820]  And I apologize for kind of leading you guys astray.
[29:34.820 --> 29:35.820]  Yeah.
[29:35.820 --> 29:38.820]  But here I am, uh, addressing my mistakes.
[29:38.820 --> 29:44.700]  Also I said that I would not recommend cutting clones directly into cocoa.
[29:44.700 --> 29:48.460]  We had a listener saying that they were taking their clones into cocoa and their clones were
[29:48.460 --> 29:49.460]  dying.
[29:49.460 --> 29:51.260]  I said, that's not a good idea.
[29:51.260 --> 29:55.580]  I got several messages saying basically go fuck yourself because I cut clones into cocoa
[29:55.580 --> 29:56.580]  and it works.
[29:56.580 --> 29:57.580]  Of course.
[29:57.820 --> 29:58.820]  Of course.
[29:58.820 --> 30:00.380]  Somebody is going to tell you they can do something.
[30:00.380 --> 30:04.220]  Well, I believe you and I'm sure that it does work for you, but for the listener who they
[30:04.220 --> 30:06.820]  were all dying on, it obviously wasn't working.
[30:06.820 --> 30:08.900]  And I recommended they go back to basics.
[30:08.900 --> 30:10.980]  Those people that it's working for, that's rad.
[30:10.980 --> 30:14.500]  You've probably got a lot of experience and you know really well what you're doing.
[30:14.500 --> 30:16.220]  You've dialed it in and you're not killing clones.
[30:16.220 --> 30:18.500]  We had a listener killing them.
[30:18.500 --> 30:19.660]  So something wasn't working.
[30:19.660 --> 30:23.660]  And when it's not working, that's when I start going backwards and start saying what's going
[30:23.660 --> 30:26.860]  on, what's wrong when the engine doesn't work, you got to take it apart and rebuild that
[30:26.860 --> 30:27.860]  bitch.
[30:27.860 --> 30:30.380]  And I was just trying to take it apart and start going back to the white belt level.
[30:30.380 --> 30:31.820]  And then we'll work our way back up.
[30:31.820 --> 30:34.740]  And maybe when they're good again, they understand the basics of cloning.
[30:34.740 --> 30:36.180]  We'll get them going back into cocoa.
[30:36.180 --> 30:38.180]  But for that person, it wasn't working.
[30:38.180 --> 30:39.180]  But I can't say that.
[30:39.180 --> 30:41.340]  No, you cannot clone into cocoa.
[30:41.340 --> 30:43.300]  That's probably not the thing to say.
[30:43.300 --> 30:45.900]  It's probably not recommended for beginners.
[30:45.900 --> 30:49.420]  And if you're having problems doing it, abandon that because you'll have much more success
[30:49.420 --> 30:50.740]  with the cloning machine.
[30:50.740 --> 30:55.180]  We're probably easy cloner, not easy cloner, the rapid router little plugs.
[30:55.500 --> 30:56.860]  You can clone into cocoa.
[30:56.860 --> 31:00.580]  I apologize if I upset you by dissing your tech.
[31:00.580 --> 31:02.140]  It does work, but not for everybody.
[31:02.140 --> 31:03.140]  They got it.
[31:03.140 --> 31:06.820]  Yeah, well, people are just coming at me and I need to be the corrections department.
[31:06.820 --> 31:08.440]  All right, enough catching up.
[31:08.440 --> 31:10.420]  Let's move on to something new.
[31:10.420 --> 31:11.420]  What do we got?
[31:11.420 --> 31:15.020]  The next part is, oh, I got a really good question on YouTube.
[31:15.020 --> 31:19.740]  And this one was a question about how do you feel about 1113 light schedules?
[31:19.740 --> 31:22.660]  And I thought I could talk briefly about that.
[31:22.660 --> 31:25.460]  An 1113 flowering schedule.
[31:25.460 --> 31:26.700]  Most of us do a 1212.
[31:26.700 --> 31:28.940]  That seems to be the traditional on-off schedule.
[31:28.940 --> 31:30.660]  1212 makes your plants flower.
[31:30.660 --> 31:34.060]  You leave them there for nine or 10 weeks and you get good buds.
[31:34.060 --> 31:37.260]  DJ Short a while back started preaching about doing...
[31:37.260 --> 31:39.700]  DJ Short's the one that made it popular for most people.
[31:39.700 --> 31:44.460]  DJ Short started talking about doing 11 hours on and 13 hours off.
[31:44.460 --> 31:47.180]  And this has several benefits.
[31:47.180 --> 31:51.220]  The first benefit is it will show more phenotypical expression.
[31:51.220 --> 31:55.220]  If you're growing from seed, you'll see more variation in your different seedlings.
[31:55.220 --> 31:59.580]  You'll see different phenotypical expressions, more expression, I guess I can say.
[31:59.580 --> 32:01.940]  You'll see, yeah, they'll show their variances a little bit more.
[32:01.940 --> 32:04.780]  Because it's just getting less light.
[32:04.780 --> 32:07.260]  Less light, more time to express, I guess.
[32:07.260 --> 32:08.580]  More time to show what they...
[32:08.580 --> 32:10.060]  They say that kids grow in their sleep.
[32:10.060 --> 32:11.540]  Do the plants do the same thing?
[32:11.540 --> 32:12.540]  They start...
[32:12.540 --> 32:16.500]  If you watch a video of a plant on a time-lapse camera, they don't do a lot during the day.
[32:16.500 --> 32:18.460]  They get blown around and they try to stay there.
[32:18.460 --> 32:20.380]  At night, they look like they're swimming and they grow.
[32:20.380 --> 32:22.980]  The leaves go up and the leaves go down, the leaves go up and they go down.
[32:22.980 --> 32:23.980]  Jeff, I didn't know that.
[32:23.980 --> 32:24.980]  It looks like a jack.
[32:24.980 --> 32:25.980]  You know what I mean?
[32:25.980 --> 32:27.780]  Like when you move a jack, you move the handle down and the jack goes up.
[32:27.780 --> 32:29.340]  That's how it looks like the leaves are kind of swimming.
[32:29.340 --> 32:30.580]  They pump up like a jack.
[32:30.580 --> 32:31.900]  Yeah, if you watch them overnight.
[32:31.900 --> 32:32.900]  Oh, tight.
[32:32.900 --> 32:34.460]  Yeah, it's really neat to see.
[32:34.460 --> 32:35.460]  Really neat to see.
[32:35.460 --> 32:38.420]  So they do most of their growth, most of their production at nighttime.
[32:38.420 --> 32:42.260]  And I've learned that if you give them that more, that longer extended night period, you
[32:42.260 --> 32:45.780]  do see a little bit different phenotypical expression.
[32:46.060 --> 32:49.900]  It will also, in my opinion, speed them up in their flowering time.
[32:49.900 --> 32:53.900]  You may save up to a week, maybe 10 days on some phenotypes.
[32:53.900 --> 32:58.580]  If you've got a 70-dayer and you cut it down to 11-13, you may have a 65-dayer at this
[32:58.580 --> 32:59.580]  point.
[32:59.580 --> 33:00.580]  Oh.
[33:00.580 --> 33:01.580]  Yeah, don't take my word for it.
[33:01.580 --> 33:02.580]  That's going to be plant and phenotype dependent.
[33:02.580 --> 33:03.580]  Oh, 100%.
[33:03.580 --> 33:06.460]  But get your scope out and start paying attention.
[33:06.460 --> 33:07.460]  You may notice different things.
[33:07.460 --> 33:08.460]  Get them brown.
[33:08.460 --> 33:12.340]  Now, this, get them brown, that sounds grosser than it should.
[33:12.340 --> 33:18.260]  This is going to be plant and strain and phenotype dependent on if this is best for
[33:18.260 --> 33:20.540]  your plants or not.
[33:20.540 --> 33:24.380]  If you're running from seed in a small tent and you're just doing a pheno hunt, I would
[33:24.380 --> 33:26.820]  go with the 11-13.
[33:26.820 --> 33:31.100]  This also has advantages in a large-scale environment.
[33:31.100 --> 33:35.300]  Imagine if you've got 24 lights and I cut off one hour a day.
[33:35.300 --> 33:37.740]  Over a month, you've got 30 days at 24 lights.
[33:37.740 --> 33:43.340]  That's 720 hours of lighting that you're not paying for, which is also air conditioning
[33:43.340 --> 33:45.060]  you're not paying for.
[33:45.060 --> 33:48.220]  Those bulbs are also going to last you that hour longer.
[33:48.220 --> 33:49.220]  That just multiplies.
[33:49.220 --> 33:50.900]  If you're running 24, what are they?
[33:50.900 --> 33:52.380]  I don't even know the numbers I started with.
[33:52.380 --> 33:53.380]  Is it 24 lights?
[33:53.380 --> 33:54.380]  I'm fucking lost.
[33:54.380 --> 33:55.380]  Yeah, we said 24 lights.
[33:55.380 --> 33:56.380]  Yeah.
[33:56.380 --> 33:57.380]  It just scales up.
[33:57.380 --> 33:59.020]  If you go more lights, you're saving more money.
[33:59.020 --> 34:02.940]  So even just one hour, but is that pushing it, Jeff?
[34:02.940 --> 34:05.780]  It just depends on the strain, I suppose.
[34:05.820 --> 34:09.180]  If you're doing a pheno hunt, I would recommend it to start off with that just to find the
[34:09.180 --> 34:15.540]  one because it's going to show you they're able to express their phenotypes more fully.
[34:15.540 --> 34:17.380]  I don't know how else to say those words.
[34:17.380 --> 34:18.380]  I got you.
[34:18.380 --> 34:19.620]  Yeah, the tall ones are going to get taller.
[34:19.620 --> 34:21.580]  The purple ones will show more purple.
[34:21.580 --> 34:25.180]  The stinky one will get stinkier, in my opinion, in my experience.
[34:25.180 --> 34:26.660]  Okay, yeah.
[34:26.660 --> 34:32.280]  That may do a little bit to your yields because we do say that light is the number one source
[34:32.280 --> 34:36.480]  of energy and food for the plant and you're cutting down an hour of that.
[34:36.480 --> 34:43.520]  So that may show a small reduction in yield and in harvest weight.
[34:43.520 --> 34:45.640]  Have you seen a big difference in that?
[34:45.640 --> 34:47.440]  Not big enough to make it worth it.
[34:47.440 --> 34:50.480]  No, I would rather do the 1113 a lot of times.
[34:50.480 --> 34:51.480]  Yes.
[34:51.480 --> 34:52.480]  All right.
[34:52.480 --> 34:53.480]  Cool.
[34:53.480 --> 34:54.480]  Now I'm really going to throw the world off.
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.240]  Clint, I'm going to imagine that several people signed out of this episode because we were
[34:58.240 --> 34:59.880]  a little bit rambly at the beginning.
[35:00.440 --> 35:03.320]  They didn't think they were going to get this magical fucking grow tip, bro.
[35:03.320 --> 35:04.640]  We got some magic.
[35:04.640 --> 35:08.440]  Here's a tip that I don't share with a lot of people that I don't talk about a lot.
[35:08.440 --> 35:10.720]  This is something, this is an advanced tip.
[35:10.720 --> 35:15.320]  At the end of flowering, I change my timer.
[35:15.320 --> 35:17.800]  I used to preach for people to reduce time.
[35:17.800 --> 35:21.960]  If you've got a plant that takes way too long to flower, here's one piece of advice and
[35:21.960 --> 35:23.700]  I'll share what I was going to say after that.
[35:23.700 --> 35:27.200]  If you've got a plant that takes too long to flower, I'm going to use lemon gee as my
[35:27.200 --> 35:29.720]  example because this works very well with lemon gee.
[35:30.560 --> 35:32.720]  If you're growing lemon gee or a lemon gee cross take note.
[35:32.720 --> 35:37.440]  If you've got a cultivar that takes 11, 12, 13 weeks, this will work for you.
[35:37.440 --> 35:38.960]  This will be very helpful.
[35:38.960 --> 35:42.680]  If that plant takes too long, you need it to hurry up, you're running 12, 12 or you're
[35:42.680 --> 35:48.680]  running 11, 13 toward the end of flower, you can reduce the amount of light hours and that
[35:48.680 --> 35:50.240]  will make that plant speed up.
[35:50.240 --> 35:51.880]  It does the same thing that happens outdoors.
[35:51.880 --> 35:54.080]  It makes the plant go, oh shit, fall is coming.
[35:54.080 --> 35:55.080]  It's here.
[35:55.080 --> 35:56.080]  Oh crap.
[35:56.080 --> 35:57.880]  I got to hurry up and do my shit so it starts finishing up.
[35:57.880 --> 36:00.320]  It can do all that processing at nighttime.
[36:00.320 --> 36:01.440]  So it starts finishing up.
[36:01.440 --> 36:03.360]  It starts speeding up that finishing process.
[36:03.360 --> 36:08.020]  It starts hardening up the trichome start ripening up so you can slowly reduce the amount
[36:08.020 --> 36:09.020]  of daylight hours.
[36:09.020 --> 36:13.560]  You can get down to eight hours a day if you want to and just have eight hours on and 16
[36:13.560 --> 36:16.920]  hours off and let the plant finish like that for the last couple of weeks.
[36:16.920 --> 36:17.920]  There you go.
[36:17.920 --> 36:19.400]  Quite often during flush I'll reduce.
[36:19.400 --> 36:24.080]  So if I've got something lemon gee, I'll reduce the lights to 10 hours on for a week and then
[36:24.080 --> 36:27.360]  I'll move them to eight hours on for a week and for the last week I'll put them on for
[36:27.360 --> 36:31.960]  six hours on and that plant will really finish up and I'm flushing through that time period
[36:31.960 --> 36:32.960]  also.
[36:32.960 --> 36:33.960]  Yeah.
[36:33.960 --> 36:34.960]  Flushing is free.
[36:34.960 --> 36:36.300]  I'm saving a lot of money on less lights.
[36:36.300 --> 36:41.180]  It's really an economical way to help that plant finish up so you can reduce the amount
[36:41.180 --> 36:45.640]  of daylight hours to finish up a slower finishing cultivar.
[36:45.640 --> 36:50.240]  Is a wood temperature in the room do anything for that too?
[36:50.240 --> 36:53.360]  Like would dropping the temperature make things speed up a little bit?
[36:53.360 --> 36:57.640]  A little bit colder will help you, but you can't have too large of a swing because that's
[36:57.640 --> 36:59.440]  when you start promoting powdery mildew.
[36:59.440 --> 37:03.880]  But if you overall lower your daytime and nighttime temperature slowly and keep your
[37:03.880 --> 37:07.800]  vapor pressure deficit in line, that is something that you can do.
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.180]  That'll bring out purples, that'll bring out density and that'll also bring out some flavors
[37:11.180 --> 37:12.180]  and some colors.
[37:12.180 --> 37:13.180]  Yeah.
[37:13.180 --> 37:15.640]  I think about outside when it starts getting cold, we start seeing those beautiful fall
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.600]  colors that'll happen indoors with the temperature and this light adjustment as well.
[37:20.040 --> 37:23.640]  And if you're doing the 1113 and then you start dropping the lights down, you're really
[37:23.640 --> 37:25.600]  going to see that fall change in your plants.
[37:25.600 --> 37:27.720]  It's when you get some really cool photos.
[37:27.720 --> 37:30.200]  Oh, the photos come out excellent.
[37:30.200 --> 37:33.600]  Man, you share some rad stuff on your Instagram.
[37:33.600 --> 37:34.600]  Thank you.
[37:34.600 --> 37:35.600]  I appreciate that.
[37:35.600 --> 37:37.840]  You've got some good friends growing some good weed it sounds like.
[37:37.840 --> 37:42.560]  I have refrained from posting a lot of my own photos because if the breeder can breed
[37:42.560 --> 37:46.620]  a strain and grow it to perfection, good job, high five.
[37:46.660 --> 37:51.380]  If I can breed seeds and get them to a friend who grows in a completely different style
[37:51.380 --> 37:56.020]  than me and they can grow them to perfection and snapshots of it, that's when you know
[37:56.020 --> 37:58.340]  you've got a winning seed and a winning plant right there.
[37:58.340 --> 38:01.620]  If the breeder can do it, that's expected, that's fucking required.
[38:01.620 --> 38:04.960]  That's like if Metallica plays in her Sandman, they better get it right.
[38:04.960 --> 38:08.820]  If we went up there and played in her Sandman, who knows how that's going to fucking go.
[38:08.820 --> 38:11.020]  Yeah, for sure.
[38:11.020 --> 38:12.020]  I better get it fucking right.
[38:12.020 --> 38:15.140]  So when it comes well, it's like, oh, all right.
[38:15.140 --> 38:16.140]  Yes.
[38:16.660 --> 38:17.660]  Here's what I want to share.
[38:17.660 --> 38:20.060]  Here's what I want people to see is that they can do this too.
[38:20.060 --> 38:23.220]  I've been sharing a lot of other people's and Matt, thanks for noticing that they've
[38:23.220 --> 38:24.900]  been doing a really good job for me lately.
[38:24.900 --> 38:26.220]  Dude, you got some good friends.
[38:26.220 --> 38:27.220]  Yeah.
[38:27.220 --> 38:28.980]  I've got some people out there running testers of stuff.
[38:28.980 --> 38:31.540]  They don't even know what it is and they are killing it.
[38:31.540 --> 38:32.540]  Yeah, dude.
[38:32.540 --> 38:33.540]  Yeah.
[38:33.540 --> 38:36.540]  Because I don't want them to treat the plant in any specific way because, oh, it's got
[38:36.540 --> 38:38.620]  this in it or it's this, or I suspect it's this.
[38:38.620 --> 38:41.100]  I just say, this is some seeds.
[38:41.100 --> 38:42.100]  These are seeds.
[38:42.100 --> 38:43.460]  They're feminized so you don't have to worry about boys.
[38:43.460 --> 38:44.460]  Oh, how easy.
[38:44.460 --> 38:45.460]  Grow them.
[38:45.780 --> 38:46.780]  They don't get into any problems.
[38:46.780 --> 38:49.140]  Take good pictures, document the shit and they don't know what they've got and they
[38:49.140 --> 38:50.620]  send stellar photos.
[38:50.620 --> 38:51.620]  Yeah.
[38:51.620 --> 38:52.620]  Yeah.
[38:52.620 --> 38:53.620]  Good job to my testers.
[38:53.620 --> 38:54.620]  Thank you guys.
[38:54.620 --> 38:58.940]  You've got such amazing, uh, I mean, you've got a real grip, uh, like products now.
[38:58.940 --> 38:59.940]  Yeah.
[38:59.940 --> 39:00.940]  Do really well.
[39:00.940 --> 39:01.940]  Like a whole line now.
[39:01.940 --> 39:02.940]  Yeah.
[39:02.940 --> 39:06.500]  Dude, there are, I don't want to, I don't even want to brag because it just depends
[39:06.500 --> 39:08.900]  on when you catch me, how much packaging time I've had.
[39:08.900 --> 39:12.540]  Like if I've had time to sit here and just stuff seeds into packages and like find the
[39:12.540 --> 39:15.540]  right seeds for the right packages and count them out and get them going.
[39:15.540 --> 39:19.540]  I've got a lot of lines available, but sometimes I have to package them all up.
[39:19.540 --> 39:25.660]  So I feel that, yeah, I, uh, I was looking at, there's a grip, a lemon Jeffrey seed
[39:25.660 --> 39:26.660]  sitting over here.
[39:26.660 --> 39:29.980]  I was like, Hey, there might be a few packs of lemon Jeffrey.
[39:29.980 --> 39:34.140]  Those may or may not be for an expo that might be coming up in January.
[39:34.140 --> 39:35.740]  It might be, you got to start packing up early.
[39:35.740 --> 39:40.260]  I'm trying to have, have, you know, there might be a limited supply of those stashed
[39:40.260 --> 39:41.260]  for Indo expo.
[39:41.260 --> 39:42.260]  That's tight.
[39:42.980 --> 39:43.980]  That's exciting.
[39:43.980 --> 39:46.860]  Let's move on to this lighting thing because I T we tease the world.
[39:46.860 --> 39:48.300]  They may have cut out once already.
[39:48.300 --> 39:51.380]  And then I tease that we're going to give them a secret tip that I don't share a lot.
[39:51.380 --> 39:52.740]  And then we talked about other shit.
[39:52.740 --> 39:53.740]  I love that.
[39:53.740 --> 39:56.060]  You keep kept that tease going for a while.
[39:56.060 --> 39:57.340]  Here's something I don't teach a lot.
[39:57.340 --> 39:58.780]  This is a really advanced trick.
[39:58.780 --> 40:01.120]  This is going to scare the shit out of a lot of people.
[40:01.120 --> 40:02.540]  This is going to be controversial.
[40:02.540 --> 40:04.580]  I'm really glad that this came at the end of this episode.
[40:04.580 --> 40:05.660]  This is like a golden nugget.
[40:05.660 --> 40:09.420]  This is like, this is the prize at the bottom of the fucking cereal that you went, that
[40:09.420 --> 40:10.620]  your parents won't let you dig for.
[40:10.620 --> 40:12.060]  You got to eat the cereal before you get to it.
[40:12.860 --> 40:14.620]  Here's the prize boys and girls.
[40:14.620 --> 40:16.660]  Something that I find very useful.
[40:16.660 --> 40:23.940]  If I run a 1212 or an 1113 light cycle toward the end of flower, basically the day I begin
[40:23.940 --> 40:27.900]  flushing, this is probably 10 days before I harvest the plant.
[40:27.900 --> 40:32.820]  I will put my timer back on an 18 six light cycle.
[40:32.820 --> 40:37.940]  Yes, I will repeat that at the very end of my flowering phase.
[40:37.940 --> 40:45.140]  I return my timer to an 18 six light cycle to where my flowering plants receive 18 hours
[40:45.140 --> 40:50.580]  of daylight per day and six hours of night cycle per day.
[40:50.580 --> 40:52.460]  My flowering plants.
[40:52.460 --> 40:54.500]  Now people are going, what the fuck are you doing?
[40:54.500 --> 40:55.500]  Ross to Jeff?
[40:55.500 --> 40:59.100]  Cause I see Clint kind of stroking his beard and going, you're going to have a lot of splaining
[40:59.100 --> 41:00.100]  to do.
[41:00.100 --> 41:02.940]  Oh man, you got to throw them back in to get them growing again.
[41:02.940 --> 41:03.940]  It makes them grow.
[41:03.940 --> 41:07.860]  It makes them beef up and people are going to say, won't that make your plants Herm?
[41:07.900 --> 41:09.580]  Isn't that going to cause problems?
[41:09.580 --> 41:11.060]  We've got 10 days, yeah.
[41:11.060 --> 41:12.860]  10 days or two weeks and we're flushing.
[41:12.860 --> 41:15.700]  So you're flushing, you flip the light back on.
[41:15.700 --> 41:20.300]  I said earlier that light is the number one source of food and energy for our plants.
[41:20.300 --> 41:21.300]  Let's beef it up.
[41:21.300 --> 41:23.380]  It will actually make those buds swell up.
[41:23.380 --> 41:28.100]  A lot of times a good cultivar will beef up on the last couple of weeks of flower.
[41:28.100 --> 41:32.340]  Imagine if that beefy bitch gets extra energy at that last 10 days.
[41:32.340 --> 41:33.420]  That's what the sun's doing.
[41:33.420 --> 41:34.620]  That's what the sun would do.
[41:34.620 --> 41:38.340]  So they really swell up on you and people are going to go, but they're going to revege
[41:38.340 --> 41:39.340]  or they're going to Herm.
[41:39.340 --> 41:41.780]  No, you've only got 10 days.
[41:41.780 --> 41:46.380]  Even if they do, if they do Herm, then you might get a nanner, but nothing's going to
[41:46.380 --> 41:50.580]  happen because that nanner will be sterile and there's no time for anything to pollinate.
[41:50.580 --> 41:54.740]  Even if it does drop pollen, there are no viable parts of the plant that can receive
[41:54.740 --> 41:55.740]  pollen.
[41:55.740 --> 41:56.740]  We are way past that.
[41:56.740 --> 41:59.580]  This plant is basically, it's one of the golden girls now, bro.
[41:59.580 --> 42:00.980]  It's not going to get pregnant on you.
[42:00.980 --> 42:02.420]  It's way too late for that.
[42:02.420 --> 42:03.420]  That's awesome.
[42:03.420 --> 42:04.420]  Yeah.
[42:05.220 --> 42:08.100]  The plant is done at this point, so it's working on its end phases of life.
[42:08.100 --> 42:09.340]  It's not going to get pollinated.
[42:09.340 --> 42:13.460]  It's not going to toss any pollen and it's just going to beef up and it may begin to
[42:13.460 --> 42:19.380]  revege if you let it go for too long, but that's going to take you 14, 15, 17 days before
[42:19.380 --> 42:21.420]  you see any signs of revege.
[42:21.420 --> 42:22.460]  And you'll know what that looks like.
[42:22.460 --> 42:25.500]  If you're familiar with your cultivar, it'll look like it just kind of foxtailed a little
[42:25.500 --> 42:26.640]  bit too much.
[42:26.640 --> 42:28.660]  So that is something you can try.
[42:28.660 --> 42:31.400]  If you want to add a little bit of beef, a little bit of bulk.
[42:31.400 --> 42:36.000]  If you feel like you lost a little bit of beef because you did the 11, 13 at the end
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.920]  for the last seven days, throw them fuckers back on 11, 13.
[42:39.920 --> 42:42.340]  This is something I would recommend experimenting with.
[42:42.340 --> 42:44.440]  Don't start right away by doing it for 10 days.
[42:44.440 --> 42:46.800]  Maybe do it for five days and see what happens.
[42:46.800 --> 42:47.800]  Yeah.
[42:47.800 --> 42:48.800]  Give it a shot.
[42:48.800 --> 42:51.520]  Then the next crop, do it for 10 days and see what happens.
[42:51.520 --> 42:53.560]  Then maybe extend it up to 14.
[42:53.560 --> 42:55.900]  I wouldn't go past 14 days.
[42:55.900 --> 42:58.520]  Now I have made other recommendations for other light cycles.
[42:58.520 --> 43:01.600]  That is basically around my breeding programs.
[43:01.600 --> 43:05.680]  I do know other things and other methods and other schedules that I do when breeding.
[43:05.680 --> 43:07.920]  We may talk about that in a future episode.
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.240]  But if you want to get crazy, if you want to try something new, turn those lights back
[43:12.240 --> 43:17.920]  on to 18 hours on and six hours off at the end of your flowering cycle as you flush your
[43:17.920 --> 43:22.200]  plants and see if they bulk up and beef up more than they have in the past.
[43:22.200 --> 43:23.960]  That is a golden nugget right there.
[43:23.960 --> 43:25.960]  I hope they listen to that long.
[43:25.960 --> 43:28.120]  I'm sure we'll get a couple.
[43:28.120 --> 43:29.400]  We'll see what the emails say.
[43:29.400 --> 43:30.400]  Yeah, right.
[43:30.400 --> 43:32.160]  It'll be a YouTube comment is where it will happen first.
[43:32.160 --> 43:36.080]  So a big shout out to all of our friends who listen to the show on the YouTube.
[43:36.080 --> 43:37.080]  Thanks guys.
[43:37.080 --> 43:38.080]  Like and subscribe, please.
[43:38.080 --> 43:39.080]  There you go.
[43:39.080 --> 43:40.080]  Clint set it for us.
[43:40.080 --> 43:42.840]  Hey Clint, we've been going for almost 45 minutes.
[43:42.840 --> 43:44.120]  Hey, we did it Jeff.
[43:44.120 --> 43:45.120]  We did it buddy.
[43:45.120 --> 43:46.120]  High five.
[43:46.120 --> 43:47.120]  What a good time man.
[43:47.120 --> 43:48.120]  Excellent job.
[43:48.120 --> 43:49.120]  Yeah.
[43:49.120 --> 43:50.120]  Good job.
[43:50.120 --> 43:52.360]  Man, while I've got you here on the microphone, do you have anything that you would like to
[43:52.360 --> 43:55.280]  say to the world or anything you'd like to plug?
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.120]  You know, I do not have anything that I'm doing lately.
[43:59.120 --> 44:00.920]  You're sort of an anonymous kind of a dude.
[44:00.920 --> 44:02.960]  You're like dad at dad.com lately.
[44:02.960 --> 44:04.480]  Yeah, it's good for you, bro.
[44:04.480 --> 44:05.480]  I appreciate it.
[44:05.480 --> 44:07.000]  Yeah, that's what it is.
[44:07.000 --> 44:10.440]  So many people out there aren't dads at dad.com that they should be doing.
[44:10.440 --> 44:11.880]  So big shout out that you're doing it.
[44:11.880 --> 44:12.880]  Yeah.
[44:12.880 --> 44:14.680]  I'm just happy to be able to come and hang out.
[44:14.680 --> 44:17.560]  Hopefully the podcast world is having a good time with us.
[44:17.560 --> 44:22.040]  So I'm sure they were excited to hear your voice and bro, you went 45 minutes without
[44:22.040 --> 44:23.200]  crashing the fucking show.
[44:23.200 --> 44:24.760]  You ready to do something stupid?
[44:25.240 --> 44:25.760]  Yeah.
[44:25.760 --> 44:26.760]  Wasn't I supposed to do a dab?
[44:26.760 --> 44:27.760]  I'm just joking.
[44:27.760 --> 44:30.600]  I was hoping that you were going to catch my hand.
[44:30.600 --> 44:31.600]  That was fucking awesome.
[44:31.600 --> 44:33.320]  Bro, thanks for coming on the podcast.
[44:33.320 --> 44:34.320]  Thanks for being an awesome guest.
[44:34.320 --> 44:36.000]  Thanks for being a cool comedy buddy.
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.320]  And just thanks for being a good friend, man.
[44:37.320 --> 44:38.320]  Yeah, dude, it's been great.
[44:38.320 --> 44:39.320]  Thanks for hanging out, bro.
[44:39.320 --> 44:40.920]  I'm going to wrap up this podcast here.
[44:40.920 --> 44:44.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, here's the part where I do that end of the show speech.

[45:24.760 --> 45:26.760]  of the cannabis community and that's what we need.
[45:26.760 --> 45:32.040]  Cannabuzz is a free cannabis friendly social media application that is available on your
[45:32.040 --> 45:34.280]  Android or Apple mobile device.

[45:43.440 --> 45:45.120]  fancy dab videos.
[45:45.120 --> 45:49.480]  If you've got a plant or a garden that has a problem, post a photo of it and we will
[45:49.480 --> 45:53.400]  kindly answer your questions and tell you how to fix your plants.

[45:59.240 --> 46:00.920]  Irie Genetics breeders group.
[46:00.920 --> 46:01.920]  You like that good grammar there?
[46:01.920 --> 46:02.920]  That was perfect.
[46:02.920 --> 46:04.440]  There is an Irie Genetics breeders group.
[46:04.440 --> 46:07.200]  You can join the group, post pictures of your Irie Genetics plants.
[46:07.200 --> 46:10.160]  You can ask questions, join the Irie army over there.
[46:10.160 --> 46:13.760]  And occasionally people in the group leave with some free beans.
[46:13.760 --> 46:14.760]  A whole tie.
[46:14.760 --> 46:15.760]  Yeah.
[46:15.760 --> 46:16.760]  So join the group, join us on Cannabuzz.
[46:16.760 --> 46:17.760]  Give me a follow.
[46:17.760 --> 46:21.000]  I am Irie underscore genetics on Cannabuzz.
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.840]  Join the family, catch a buzz.
[46:23.840 --> 46:26.600]  If you've got something else you'd like to say, perhaps you've got a product you'd like
[46:26.600 --> 46:27.600]  me to review.
[46:27.600 --> 46:29.440]  Maybe you'd like to sponsor the podcast.
[46:29.440 --> 46:31.880]  Maybe you're just not into all that social media nonsense.
[46:31.880 --> 46:32.880]  You can send me an email.
[46:32.880 --> 46:36.480]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[46:36.480 --> 46:38.280]  You know that I would love to hear from you.
[46:38.280 --> 46:40.520]  I want to thank everybody once again for listening.
[46:40.520 --> 46:43.560]  Once again, a big shout out to Clint for coming and hanging out on the show.
[46:43.560 --> 46:45.360]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[46:45.800 --> 46:48.520]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy, OG Purple Thumb.
[46:48.520 --> 46:51.880]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[46:51.880 --> 46:52.880]  Yeah.
[46:52.880 --> 46:53.880]  Give your mom a hug for us.
[46:53.880 --> 46:54.880]  There we go.
[46:54.880 --> 47:20.640]  I was waiting for that.
[47:20.640 --> 47:21.640]  January winter brings the cold on me.
[47:21.640 --> 47:22.640]  February breezes blow my worries to sea.
[47:22.640 --> 47:23.640]  And March brings my love to you.
[47:23.640 --> 47:24.640]  You make it wet.
[47:24.640 --> 47:25.640]  April rain.
[47:25.640 --> 47:26.640]  Let your rain come down on me.
[47:26.640 --> 47:27.640]  You make it wet.
[47:27.640 --> 47:45.400]  April rain.
[47:45.400 --> 47:46.400]  April rain.
[47:46.400 --> 47:47.400]  Let your rain come baby.
[47:47.400 --> 47:48.400]  You make it wet.
[47:48.400 --> 47:49.400]  April rain.
[47:49.400 --> 47:50.400]  Let your rain come down on me.
[47:50.400 --> 47:51.400]  You make it wet.
[47:51.400 --> 47:52.400]  April rain.
[47:52.400 --> 47:53.400]  April rain.
[47:53.400 --> 47:54.400]  Let your rain come baby.
[47:54.400 --> 47:55.400]  You make it wet.
[47:55.400 --> 47:56.400]  April rain.
[47:56.400 --> 47:57.400]  Let your rain come baby.
[47:57.400 --> 47:58.400]  Let your rain come down.
[47:58.400 --> 47:59.400]  I pour my head and down into my heart.
[47:59.400 --> 48:00.400]  They say that I'm the devil and I tear you apart.
[48:00.400 --> 48:01.400]  But I know you're my angel sent from up in the skies.
[48:01.400 --> 48:02.400]  With raindrops like teardrops that fall from your eyes.
[48:02.400 --> 48:03.400]  I'm knowing each and every time you're holding me.
[48:03.400 --> 48:04.400]  I'm wrapped deep inside you where you want me to be.
[48:04.400 --> 48:05.400]  And I know that you've been sent from above.
[48:05.400 --> 48:06.400]  Cause you are my baby, my angel, my love.
[48:06.400 --> 48:07.400]  You make it wet.
[48:07.400 --> 48:08.400]  April rain.
[48:08.400 --> 48:09.400]  Let your rain come down on me.
[48:09.400 --> 48:10.400]  You make it wet.
[48:10.400 --> 48:11.400]  April rain.
[48:11.400 --> 48:12.400]  April rain.
[48:12.400 --> 48:13.400]  Let your rain come down on me.
[48:13.400 --> 48:14.400]  You make it wet.
[48:14.400 --> 48:15.400]  April rain.
[48:15.400 --> 48:16.400]  Let your rain come down on me.
[48:16.400 --> 48:17.400]  You make it wet.
[48:17.400 --> 48:18.400]  April rain.
[48:18.400 --> 48:19.400]  April rain.
[48:26.400 --> 48:28.720]  Let your rain come down on me.
[48:28.720 --> 48:29.680]  You make your way.
[48:29.680 --> 48:32.640]  April rain, April rain.
[48:32.640 --> 48:34.320]  Let your rain come, baby.
[48:34.320 --> 48:36.920]  Let your rain come down.
[48:36.920 --> 48:40.040]  Baby, let your rain come down.
[48:40.040 --> 48:43.080]  Baby, let your rain come down.
[48:43.080 --> 48:47.880]  Baby, let your rain come down, down, down, down, down, down.
[48:47.880 --> 48:50.480]  Every now and then, when again I'm without you,
[48:50.480 --> 48:53.440]  I find that my mind's steady thinking about you.
[48:53.440 --> 48:55.800]  And the way that you move, the way that you groove,
[48:55.800 --> 49:00.280]  your body slowly, softly can't get off me when I'm here.
[49:00.280 --> 49:02.560]  And when I'm not, I feel I got to be.
[49:02.560 --> 49:03.760]  I used to be your player.
[49:03.760 --> 49:05.560]  What the hell you done to me?
[49:05.560 --> 49:08.120]  Now look at me with my hand behind my back,
[49:08.120 --> 49:09.960]  ringing your doorbell, wondering if you're
[49:09.960 --> 49:11.240]  like how I'm looking black.
[49:11.240 --> 49:13.880]  And when I finally see you, I'm blessed with your grace,
[49:13.880 --> 49:16.640]  with roses in my hands, tulips on my face.
[49:16.640 --> 49:18.040]  For a hug, I'd wait a minute.
[49:18.040 --> 49:19.680]  For a kiss, I'd wait an hour.
[49:19.680 --> 49:22.480]  But making me wait will just increase my force and power.
[49:22.480 --> 49:25.360]  And when I finally see you, I'mma love you all over.
[49:25.360 --> 49:28.280]  Lick your belly button and massage your shoulders.
[49:28.280 --> 49:30.600]  Love a baby buddy, I'll even be your friend.
[49:30.600 --> 49:34.040]  But here I go, thinking about you again, oh.
[49:34.040 --> 49:34.540]  Oh.
[50:10.420 --> 50:13.300]  Now I know your loving is the source of my dreams,
[50:13.300 --> 50:16.180]  like strawberries, raspberry, peaches, and creams.
[50:16.180 --> 50:19.220]  And I know that you've been sent from above,
[50:19.220 --> 50:22.580]  because you are my baby, my angel, my love.
[50:22.580 --> 50:25.540]  Ya tu me tienes muy caliente.
[50:25.540 --> 50:28.580]  No quiero que paras de repente.
[50:28.580 --> 50:31.660]  Me amas, te quiero, vamos a pirar.
[50:31.660 --> 50:34.380]  Mi lluvia de abril me hace sudar.
[50:34.380 --> 50:36.460]  You make it wet.
[50:36.460 --> 50:40.460]  April rain, let your rain come down on me.
[50:40.460 --> 50:41.460]  You make it wet.
[50:41.460 --> 50:47.180]  April rain, April rain, let your rain come down on me.
[50:47.180 --> 50:53.180]  April, lluvia de abril, dame un poco y yo vuelvo mañana.
[50:53.180 --> 51:00.660]  April, me dice lluvia de abril, dame un poco y yo vuelvo mañana.
[51:00.660 --> 51:03.020]  I'll come back tomorrow.
