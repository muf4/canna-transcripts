[00:16.700 --> 00:19.780]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.780 --> 00:21.700]  It's time for episode number 129
[00:21.700 --> 00:23.540]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.540 --> 00:27.660]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.660 --> 00:28.780]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.780 --> 00:30.040]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.040 --> 00:32.460]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:32.460 --> 00:33.940]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:33.940 --> 00:35.300]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.300 --> 00:36.980]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.980 --> 00:39.820]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.820 --> 00:41.660]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.660 --> 00:43.540]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.540 --> 00:45.740]  As always, I wanna send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.740 --> 00:47.340]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:47.340 --> 00:49.820]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.820 --> 00:51.620]  Big shout out to Kat, Koot,
[00:51.620 --> 00:53.660]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.740 --> 00:57.860]  This episode's gonna be coming out on April 18th.
[00:57.860 --> 00:59.020]  I hope everybody is in the middle
[00:59.020 --> 01:02.740]  of a happy, amazing celebration for the 420 weekend.
[01:02.740 --> 01:04.040]  With 420 being on a Wednesday,
[01:04.040 --> 01:06.740]  I'm sure a lot of people started celebrating Friday evening,
[01:06.740 --> 01:08.860]  Friday at 420 when they got off work.
[01:08.860 --> 01:10.860]  So if you're having a great 420 weekend,
[01:11.860 --> 01:12.980]  wherever you are, whatever you're doing,
[01:12.980 --> 01:14.180]  I hope you got a fat blunt roll,
[01:14.180 --> 01:15.660]  I hope you're taking a fat dab.
[01:16.500 --> 01:17.340]  I hope you've eaten some edibles,
[01:17.340 --> 01:18.660]  maybe you're taking a fat bong rip.
[01:18.660 --> 01:20.300]  However you like to consume your cannabis,
[01:20.300 --> 01:22.340]  I hope you are doing it.
[01:22.340 --> 01:23.900]  It's kinda weird without the Cannabis Cup here
[01:23.900 --> 01:25.720]  in Denver this year, everybody's spread out.
[01:25.720 --> 01:26.720]  I don't know where the party is,
[01:26.720 --> 01:28.040]  I don't know where everybody's going to be,
[01:28.040 --> 01:30.100]  but I know where I am going to be.
[01:30.100 --> 01:32.020]  That's right, I will be at the Secret Sesh.
[01:32.020 --> 01:33.500]  If you wanna learn more about the Secret Sesh
[01:33.500 --> 01:35.260]  hosted by my friend Adam Ill,
[01:35.260 --> 01:38.540]  I also heard a rumor DJ Juggie would be DJing the event.
[01:38.540 --> 01:41.580]  Make sure you check out Secret Sesh Colorado on Instagram.
[01:41.580 --> 01:44.020]  I cannot do anything to get you tickets.
[01:44.020 --> 01:46.380]  I was lucky enough to get myself one ticket
[01:46.380 --> 01:48.140]  because of course I am family.
[01:48.140 --> 01:50.380]  I've got one for myself, that's all I've got.
[01:50.380 --> 01:52.580]  I apologize, I cannot help you get in.
[01:52.580 --> 01:54.620]  I can't do anything for you.
[01:54.620 --> 01:56.580]  Figure out how to find their Instagram
[01:56.580 --> 01:58.660]  and then there are instructions on their Instagram
[01:58.660 --> 02:01.680]  on how to try to get yourself into the event.
[02:01.680 --> 02:03.280]  By the time this airs, it may be full.
[02:03.280 --> 02:05.640]  So good luck, hope to see you there.
[02:05.640 --> 02:07.440]  I wanna talk about something that I saw
[02:07.440 --> 02:09.540]  on the cannabis just recently.
[02:09.540 --> 02:12.260]  This is a little bit related to the Cannabis Cup
[02:12.260 --> 02:14.460]  not being here in Denver.
[02:14.460 --> 02:16.140]  It looks like a lot of people kind of backed out
[02:16.140 --> 02:18.960]  on coming to Colorado without the giant Cannabis Cup.
[02:18.960 --> 02:21.340]  But I'm gonna read an article from the Cannabis Cup
[02:21.340 --> 02:22.500]  and the headline goes like this,
[02:22.500 --> 02:24.540]  Cypress Hills Cannabis Cup concert
[02:24.540 --> 02:27.840]  just moved to a much smaller venue.
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.020]  The sub headline says, I think that's called the byline.
[02:31.020 --> 02:33.820]  That says fewer people will be getting insane in the brain
[02:33.820 --> 02:35.700]  for 420 this week.
[02:35.700 --> 02:37.900]  Then this article is by Ricardo Baca, of course,
[02:37.900 --> 02:39.900]  from the Cannabis Cup and it says,
[02:39.900 --> 02:42.320]  and the hits to the Cannabis Cup in Colorado keep coming.
[02:42.320 --> 02:44.060]  First, the US Cannabis Cup got booted
[02:44.060 --> 02:45.860]  from its Denver adjacent home.
[02:45.860 --> 02:46.940]  Then it's planned to stage a cup
[02:46.940 --> 02:48.700]  in Southern Colorado fell apart.
[02:48.700 --> 02:51.700]  Then High Times Magazine's largest event moved from Colorado
[02:51.700 --> 02:55.140]  for a greener, more lenient home in Southern California.
[02:55.140 --> 02:57.620]  And now the cups alone Colorado event,
[02:57.620 --> 02:59.860]  a High Times sponsored concert with Cypress Hill,
[02:59.860 --> 03:01.420]  George Clinton and others
[03:01.420 --> 03:03.800]  with a Cannabis Cup award show tagged on
[03:03.800 --> 03:05.540]  is moving to a much smaller venue
[03:05.540 --> 03:07.700]  less than a week before showtime.
[03:07.700 --> 03:10.820]  And even with, excuse me, let me try that sentence again.
[03:10.820 --> 03:13.220]  And even with the move to the smaller venue,
[03:13.220 --> 03:15.240]  tickets are still available.
[03:15.240 --> 03:17.820]  Instead of playing the 6,500 capacity
[03:17.820 --> 03:19.760]  First Bank Center in Broomfield,
[03:19.760 --> 03:21.940]  the Cypress Hill concert and High Times award show
[03:21.940 --> 03:26.100]  is moving to the 1,700 capacity Ogden Theater in Denver,
[03:26.100 --> 03:28.340]  according to promoter AEG Live.
[03:28.340 --> 03:29.840]  All tickets for the First Bank Center
[03:29.840 --> 03:32.420]  are good for the Ogden and a limited number of tickets
[03:32.420 --> 03:36.800]  remain and are on sale now, according to a media release.
[03:36.800 --> 03:38.360]  The tickets are $65.
[03:38.360 --> 03:40.000]  The bills, other acts are George Clinton
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.200]  and Parliament Funkadelic, Action Bronson and Chronix.
[03:44.200 --> 03:45.880]  You guys, you've heard Chronix on this podcast.
[03:45.880 --> 03:48.360]  I might write it down to end of the show with Chronix.
[03:48.360 --> 03:49.640]  I'm gonna put a little note on myself.
[03:49.640 --> 03:50.460]  There we go.
[03:50.460 --> 03:52.000]  I'll probably end the podcast with Chronix.
[03:52.000 --> 03:54.160]  It's one of my favorite reggae artists.
[03:54.160 --> 03:56.200]  Chronix with two Xs at the end.
[03:56.200 --> 03:58.160]  Make sure you check that out.
[03:58.160 --> 03:59.500]  Great artist.
[03:59.500 --> 04:01.100]  I wasn't gonna go to this show, you guys,
[04:01.100 --> 04:02.600]  because it was at the First Bank Center.
[04:02.600 --> 04:03.760]  It's kind of a big event.
[04:03.760 --> 04:05.280]  It's kind of a big venue.
[04:05.400 --> 04:07.240]  Unless you're up in the front in those big venues,
[04:07.240 --> 04:08.760]  it's just a party and you don't even really get
[04:08.760 --> 04:09.880]  to see the concert.
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.280]  The artist I wanna see is the least known artist
[04:13.280 --> 04:15.360]  on the bill, so he's going to play first.
[04:15.360 --> 04:18.120]  He'll probably get like 30 minutes to play,
[04:18.120 --> 04:20.020]  but in a small venue like that,
[04:20.020 --> 04:21.880]  it might be worth it for me to go.
[04:21.880 --> 04:24.200]  When you're 6'5 and you got dreadlocks down to your ass
[04:24.200 --> 04:26.300]  and a reggae band starts playing and you know all the words
[04:26.300 --> 04:27.160]  and you walk toward the front,
[04:27.160 --> 04:28.840]  people move the fuck out of your way.
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.040]  So I would just go right up front and check out Chronix
[04:31.040 --> 04:32.680]  and then I'd be gone by the time.
[04:32.680 --> 04:35.000]  I might check out Action Bronson and Parliament Funkadelic.
[04:35.760 --> 04:36.720]  That'd be fun, but yeah, I'd stick around
[04:36.720 --> 04:38.560]  and see the rest of it if I paid 65 for a ticket,
[04:38.560 --> 04:39.840]  but I just wanna go see Chronix, you guys.
[04:39.840 --> 04:41.880]  It'd be a great time in that little tiny club.
[04:41.880 --> 04:44.440]  I'm gonna continue with this article here.
[04:44.440 --> 04:46.600]  It says, so why didn't the event sell?
[04:46.600 --> 04:49.000]  Surely the lack of a company in Cannabis Cup Expo
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.120]  didn't help ticket sales,
[04:50.120 --> 04:52.080]  and with Snoop Dogg playing Fiddler's Green,
[04:52.080 --> 04:55.640]  Wiz Khalifa and Lil Wayne playing the 420 Rally,
[04:55.640 --> 04:57.640]  and Method Man and Redman playing Red Rocks
[04:57.640 --> 05:01.320]  all in the same week, competition is no doubt fierce.
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.000]  Is this venue downsizing indicative of the 420 to come?
[05:05.000 --> 05:06.160]  It's too early to say,
[05:06.160 --> 05:09.520]  but Colorado will surely see fewer cannabis tourists
[05:09.520 --> 05:13.160]  this 420 because of the Cups move west.
[05:13.160 --> 05:14.240]  That is absolutely true.
[05:14.240 --> 05:16.280]  A lot of my friends that normally would come out to Colorado
[05:16.280 --> 05:18.080]  for the 420 weekend from California,
[05:18.080 --> 05:20.720]  from Oregon, from Washington, from Michigan,
[05:20.720 --> 05:23.200]  from all over the damn place, from North Carolina,
[05:23.200 --> 05:24.200]  they are not coming out
[05:24.200 --> 05:25.820]  because there's no Cannabis Cup this year.
[05:25.820 --> 05:27.840]  There are a lot of vendors that I'd like to hang out with
[05:27.840 --> 05:30.920]  that probably I will not see this year
[05:31.560 --> 05:32.400]  because we usually bump into each other
[05:32.400 --> 05:34.720]  either at the Cannabis Cup or Age.
[05:34.720 --> 05:36.900]  So unless they're at Age in the winter or the fall time,
[05:36.900 --> 05:38.560]  I will not see them.
[05:38.560 --> 05:41.440]  Shout out to the Oil Slick Crew, Handmade Crew,
[05:41.440 --> 05:44.900]  the Hitman Glass Crew, Task and Highly Educated,
[05:44.900 --> 05:46.260]  everybody that shows up at all the events.
[05:46.260 --> 05:47.680]  There's one group in my head that I'm thinking of
[05:47.680 --> 05:50.360]  that I cannot think of, Johnny B and the No Goo Crew.
[05:50.360 --> 05:52.200]  How did I forget about those guys?
[05:52.200 --> 05:53.040]  See, all those guys,
[05:53.040 --> 05:54.600]  I'm gonna miss seeing them at the Cup this year.
[05:54.600 --> 05:57.440]  Johnny B, I hear you'll be on the road with the Goo Mobile.
[05:57.440 --> 05:58.840]  I hope to see you.
[05:58.840 --> 06:01.040]  Ab Cant, Jules, all kinds of folks
[06:01.040 --> 06:02.360]  that I'm not gonna get to see
[06:02.360 --> 06:03.480]  because there's no Cannabis Cup.
[06:03.480 --> 06:04.460]  It kind of sucks.
[06:05.440 --> 06:07.160]  I feel like I'm just ranting and screaming
[06:07.160 --> 06:08.440]  about not getting a Cannabis Cup.
[06:08.440 --> 06:09.680]  I feel like a little bitch suddenly.
[06:09.680 --> 06:11.240]  I'll quit whining about that.
[06:11.240 --> 06:12.800]  This concert, you guys, it sounds like a lot of fun.
[06:12.800 --> 06:14.580]  They've moved it to the small venue,
[06:14.580 --> 06:15.960]  but they did put out a press release
[06:15.960 --> 06:18.560]  and it says you cannot medicate in this facility.
[06:18.560 --> 06:21.080]  So there will be no ganja smoking.
[06:21.080 --> 06:21.920]  It's what they say.
[06:21.920 --> 06:24.180]  They always say that kind of shit at these events,
[06:24.180 --> 06:25.360]  but this venue is tiny
[06:25.360 --> 06:26.960]  and they can see you from all angles.
[06:26.960 --> 06:29.120]  So I don't know what they're gonna do.
[06:29.120 --> 06:31.840]  If one person starts puffing and then two people start
[06:31.840 --> 06:32.880]  and then the whole place is smoking,
[06:32.880 --> 06:34.680]  they can't kick everybody out.
[06:34.680 --> 06:35.520]  But at the same time,
[06:35.520 --> 06:37.200]  you never know what they're gonna try to do.
[06:37.200 --> 06:38.400]  They're gonna say no smoking.
[06:38.400 --> 06:40.880]  They'll probably just let you do it in there anyway.
[06:40.880 --> 06:42.720]  Oh, sorry, I'm burping while I'm recording a podcast.
[06:42.720 --> 06:45.600]  Shout out to Dr. Pepper, 23 Flavors.
[06:45.600 --> 06:46.900]  Love it, gotta have it.
[06:46.900 --> 06:49.180]  All right, you guys, that was my news article.
[06:49.180 --> 06:51.040]  I'm not gonna read any more news in this episode.
[06:51.040 --> 06:52.720]  I'll go ahead and close that web browser
[06:52.720 --> 06:55.920]  and we will go ahead and focus on some emails.
[06:55.920 --> 06:59.480]  I did an episode about listener emails
[06:59.480 --> 07:02.000]  and that spawned more emails.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.400]  Somebody sent me a message about a probiotic.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.160]  I mentioned that I like to consume probiotics.
[07:06.160 --> 07:08.480]  I like kombuchas and fermented products.
[07:08.480 --> 07:10.160]  I think they're good for digestion.
[07:10.160 --> 07:11.480]  I have some stomach problems,
[07:11.480 --> 07:13.240]  which is part of why I have a medical marijuana
[07:13.240 --> 07:16.000]  recommendation and I'll talk a lot about that.
[07:16.000 --> 07:17.240]  I don't think anybody really wants to hear
[07:17.240 --> 07:19.020]  about my medical conditions,
[07:19.020 --> 07:20.120]  but my stomach is messed up.
[07:20.120 --> 07:20.960]  It's wrecked.
[07:20.960 --> 07:21.780]  I like to take probiotics.
[07:21.780 --> 07:23.240]  It makes me feel like my food digests better.
[07:23.240 --> 07:24.640]  It makes me feel like my body's better.
[07:24.640 --> 07:27.200]  I think your gut health has a lot to do
[07:27.200 --> 07:28.840]  with your mental health and your physical health,
[07:28.840 --> 07:29.880]  so it all starts in the gut.
[07:29.880 --> 07:31.920]  So probiotics and good food.
[07:31.920 --> 07:33.480]  One of our listeners sent me an email
[07:33.480 --> 07:35.880]  asking about a specific probiotic.
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.720]  And to tell you the truth, I lost the message.
[07:37.720 --> 07:40.200]  I cannot find where that message came in.
[07:40.200 --> 07:44.040]  I can't find it on the Facebook pages, the Instagram.
[07:44.040 --> 07:46.600]  I can't find it in any of my emails.
[07:46.600 --> 07:48.440]  You asked if I had heard about a product
[07:48.440 --> 07:49.920]  or if I am familiar with the product.
[07:49.920 --> 07:51.920]  Honestly, I've never heard of that product.
[07:51.920 --> 07:54.040]  I intended to save the message you sent
[07:54.440 --> 07:55.520]  and go and research that product
[07:55.520 --> 07:56.540]  and tell you what I thought about it,
[07:56.540 --> 07:57.600]  but honestly, I don't know what happened
[07:57.600 --> 07:58.800]  to the damn message.
[07:58.800 --> 08:02.000]  So if you sent me that message, let's do this easier.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.040]  Send me it again on an email at growfromyourheart
[08:05.040 --> 08:06.080]  at hotmail.com.
[08:06.080 --> 08:07.160]  That way I'll find it.
[08:08.100 --> 08:09.720]  And I will read your email again
[08:09.720 --> 08:11.160]  and I will research that product.
[08:11.160 --> 08:13.860]  And I do apologize for losing the damn email.
[08:13.860 --> 08:14.700]  It drove me crazy.
[08:14.700 --> 08:16.880]  I spent about two hours just searching for that email.
[08:16.880 --> 08:18.080]  Seriously, not all at one time,
[08:18.080 --> 08:19.760]  but I put about two hours into looking
[08:19.760 --> 08:21.580]  for that thing probably, and I can't find the message.
[08:21.580 --> 08:22.580]  So I apologize.
[08:22.580 --> 08:24.020]  Send it again, I will answer.
[08:25.180 --> 08:27.580]  All right, our next email comes from,
[08:27.580 --> 08:29.080]  I'm opening the message right now.
[08:29.080 --> 08:31.340]  This message came from a friend of ours.
[08:31.340 --> 08:32.600]  I'm not sure if he wants me to say his name,
[08:32.600 --> 08:34.380]  so I'm not gonna, but it says,
[08:35.300 --> 08:36.620]  I'm a new listener to the show
[08:36.620 --> 08:37.780]  and I gotta say I'm a huge fan.
[08:37.780 --> 08:40.300]  I'm very thankful for the wealth of information you provide
[08:40.300 --> 08:42.340]  and all the knowledgeable guests you bring on.
[08:42.340 --> 08:44.100]  I am listening from another state at the moment,
[08:44.100 --> 08:45.800]  but have plans on moving to Colorado soon
[08:45.800 --> 08:48.880]  to get involved in the industry any way I can.
[08:48.880 --> 08:51.280]  I listened to the episode about the MED badges
[08:51.280 --> 08:52.800]  and I just had a few more questions.
[08:52.800 --> 08:54.260]  If you have your MED badge,
[08:54.260 --> 08:56.760]  does that mean you can go into a medical dispensary
[08:56.760 --> 08:59.100]  as a customer to buy products as well,
[08:59.100 --> 09:00.360]  or is that a different card?
[09:00.360 --> 09:03.640]  I hope that makes sense, but thanks again for everything
[09:03.640 --> 09:07.160]  and I look forward to meeting you one day.
[09:07.160 --> 09:08.980]  Well, I look forward to meeting you too.
[09:08.980 --> 09:10.500]  I hope we get to take some fat dabs,
[09:10.500 --> 09:12.220]  hope we smoke some flowers together.
[09:12.220 --> 09:14.020]  I would like to see what kind of flowers
[09:14.020 --> 09:15.860]  you are getting in your location
[09:15.860 --> 09:17.500]  and I'll show you what kind of flowers we've got here
[09:17.500 --> 09:19.480]  and we can smoke down together.
[09:19.480 --> 09:20.560]  You're a new listener.
[09:20.900 --> 09:22.220]  I encourage you to go back and listen
[09:22.220 --> 09:25.060]  to a few of the older episodes if you're a new listener.
[09:25.060 --> 09:27.720]  Listen to, I think it's 50, 55,
[09:27.720 --> 09:30.540]  then there's an episode about scheduling your grow,
[09:30.540 --> 09:32.020]  scheduling a perpetual grow.
[09:32.020 --> 09:34.120]  There's episodes about building your garden.
[09:34.120 --> 09:35.980]  I strongly recommend listening to some of those
[09:35.980 --> 09:39.060]  more educational, in-depth, informative episodes.
[09:39.980 --> 09:40.980]  What else did you say here?
[09:40.980 --> 09:41.820]  You're very thankful.
[09:41.820 --> 09:43.140]  Well, you're very welcome.
[09:43.140 --> 09:44.440]  Definitely very welcome.
[09:44.440 --> 09:48.900]  Your main question is the MED badge,
[09:48.920 --> 09:51.440]  does it work like a Colorado red card
[09:51.440 --> 09:53.320]  or a medical marijuana recommendation?
[09:53.320 --> 09:55.700]  The red cards are now purple, which is a drastic change.
[09:55.700 --> 09:58.440]  Anyway, no, the main answer is no.
[09:58.440 --> 10:01.540]  The Colorado MED badge does not work the same
[10:01.540 --> 10:04.000]  as your Colorado medical marijuana recommendation.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.820]  You cannot shop in a medical marijuana facility
[10:06.820 --> 10:08.380]  just because your badge.
[10:08.380 --> 10:10.240]  It does not work like that.
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.040]  Your badge will get you some discounts at other dispensaries
[10:14.040 --> 10:15.260]  if you shop at a dispensary.
[10:15.260 --> 10:18.840]  It also gets you into some of the smoke lounges for free
[10:19.780 --> 10:20.980]  and I know that if I wear my badge to the Cana Canyon,
[10:20.980 --> 10:22.980]  Camille does not charge me to get in.
[10:22.980 --> 10:23.880]  Camille has never charged me.
[10:23.880 --> 10:25.780]  No one's ever charged me to get into the Cana Canyon
[10:25.780 --> 10:28.180]  because I do advertising and I show love to the community.
[10:28.180 --> 10:30.660]  But if you have an MED badge,
[10:30.660 --> 10:32.660]  they will not charge you to get into the Cana Canyon
[10:32.660 --> 10:35.140]  is where most people would pay $5 at the door.
[10:35.140 --> 10:37.080]  So there are some perks of having the badge,
[10:37.080 --> 10:39.740]  just some industry perks, some friendly things that come,
[10:39.740 --> 10:43.000]  but it does not work as a medical marijuana recommendation.
[10:44.320 --> 10:45.860]  To get a medical marijuana recommendation,
[10:45.860 --> 10:47.600]  to get into a medical marijuana facility,
[10:47.620 --> 10:48.860]  you do need to see a doctor.
[10:48.860 --> 10:52.780]  There's no doctor involved in the MED paperwork
[10:52.780 --> 10:53.620]  and questionnaire.
[10:53.620 --> 10:55.420]  So I hope that answers your question.
[10:55.420 --> 10:56.420]  One thing I will mention,
[10:56.420 --> 10:59.060]  if you do have a Colorado medical marijuana card,
[10:59.060 --> 11:03.300]  you can use that card in Las Vegas in the state of Nevada.
[11:03.300 --> 11:06.100]  Nevada has medical marijuana and they do a reciprocal
[11:06.100 --> 11:08.160]  program where other states cards work there.
[11:08.160 --> 11:10.620]  So if you're a tourist and you are in Las Vegas,
[11:10.620 --> 11:12.340]  or if you're in the state of Nevada,
[11:12.340 --> 11:13.620]  before you go to the bunny ranch,
[11:13.620 --> 11:15.740]  you can stop and grab yourself some ganja.
[11:15.760 --> 11:18.760]  So big up to Nevada for being a reciprocating state
[11:18.760 --> 11:21.040]  on the medical marijuana recommendation cards.
[11:21.040 --> 11:22.500]  That is super cool.
[11:22.500 --> 11:24.240]  So I hope that answered your question.
[11:24.240 --> 11:25.200]  I appreciate the email.
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.600]  Please send me more questions.
[11:26.600 --> 11:30.480]  I do appreciate the listener interaction.
[11:30.480 --> 11:32.160]  All right, I got another email.
[11:32.160 --> 11:34.440]  This was a Facebook message from a friend of ours.
[11:34.440 --> 11:36.320]  And he asked me basically,
[11:36.320 --> 11:39.720]  what stops people or is it possible for somebody
[11:39.720 --> 11:43.300]  to buy a package of seeds and grow some plants out of it
[11:43.300 --> 11:45.680]  and then call those plants something else
[11:46.520 --> 11:48.460]  and then enter cannabis cups or other competitions
[11:48.460 --> 11:50.740]  with something that they claim is something they bred,
[11:50.740 --> 11:53.140]  but is actually something that they have purchased
[11:53.140 --> 11:56.200]  from a seed bank or they got a clone from somebody.
[11:56.200 --> 11:58.580]  And the answer to that is nothing is stopping that
[11:58.580 --> 12:01.980]  other than our community and people's morals.
[12:01.980 --> 12:05.600]  But honestly, if I sold you seeds of any strain
[12:05.600 --> 12:07.820]  that I bred, you could take them home, you could grow them,
[12:07.820 --> 12:09.140]  you could find the keeper,
[12:09.140 --> 12:11.420]  you could wait three or four months until everybody forgot
[12:11.420 --> 12:12.260]  that you had that.
[12:12.260 --> 12:13.780]  And you could say, hey, look what I created.
[12:13.840 --> 12:15.800]  And you could name it your whatever.
[12:15.800 --> 12:17.720]  I've got Arrowhead water bottles in front of me.
[12:17.720 --> 12:20.080]  So I'm gonna say, you could say you bred your Arrowhead
[12:20.080 --> 12:21.320]  and you can call it this Arrowhead.
[12:21.320 --> 12:23.280]  You could enter it into cannabis cups
[12:23.280 --> 12:25.520]  and you're gonna fool a lot of people,
[12:25.520 --> 12:28.320]  but you won't fool the people that are really
[12:28.320 --> 12:31.200]  into the industry that know what strain is what strain.
[12:31.200 --> 12:33.360]  There are guys when we go to cannabis cups,
[12:33.360 --> 12:36.080]  you can smoke a flower, somebody will pass you a joint.
[12:36.080 --> 12:37.240]  And a lot of these guys will say,
[12:37.240 --> 12:39.820]  oh, is that Aaron's OG Kush that he grew over there
[12:39.820 --> 12:40.680]  at the clinic?
[12:40.680 --> 12:42.900]  And people know what these flowers taste like,
[12:42.920 --> 12:45.240]  look like, smell like, we're catching on,
[12:45.240 --> 12:46.620]  all the stuff that stands out.
[12:46.620 --> 12:49.560]  There are very few things that stand out enough
[12:49.560 --> 12:51.480]  to be cup winners.
[12:51.480 --> 12:53.360]  And so when we smoke these things, we notice them.
[12:53.360 --> 12:56.040]  We remember the flavor, remember the high,
[12:56.040 --> 12:57.900]  and then when we smoke it again, it's familiar.
[12:57.900 --> 13:00.040]  So if you try to pass it off as something else,
[13:00.040 --> 13:02.040]  somebody in the circle is gonna notice.
[13:02.040 --> 13:05.700]  But honestly, 90% of the people in the world would be fooled.
[13:05.700 --> 13:06.560]  They will believe you.
[13:06.560 --> 13:09.200]  But the only thing stopping you from doing it
[13:09.200 --> 13:12.600]  is having some morals and not being a cannabis dick.
[13:13.300 --> 13:14.140]  I don't remember the year exactly,
[13:14.140 --> 13:16.820]  but I do remember that several years back,
[13:16.820 --> 13:20.260]  there was a person who bought a bunch of cannabis.
[13:20.260 --> 13:21.740]  I don't remember where he purchased the cannabis.
[13:21.740 --> 13:24.940]  I think he bought it from a coffee shop in Amsterdam
[13:24.940 --> 13:27.340]  or from a grower in Amsterdam, in Holland,
[13:27.340 --> 13:30.060]  and he entered it into the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam,
[13:30.060 --> 13:31.900]  the original Cannabis Cup.
[13:31.900 --> 13:35.900]  And he walked around and persuaded people at the cup
[13:35.900 --> 13:37.660]  to vote for him as the best.
[13:37.660 --> 13:39.140]  They kind of bought votes from people.
[13:39.140 --> 13:41.260]  It wasn't a legitimately won cannabis cup,
[13:41.280 --> 13:43.160]  but these guys won a cup.
[13:43.160 --> 13:45.920]  They kind of stole a cup from DNA Genetics
[13:45.920 --> 13:48.480]  by buying another professional grower's flowers
[13:48.480 --> 13:49.720]  and putting their name on it
[13:49.720 --> 13:51.480]  and marketing it as their name
[13:51.480 --> 13:53.240]  to create their new seed company,
[13:53.240 --> 13:55.600]  to make hype on their seed company.
[13:55.600 --> 13:57.120]  But a lot of the people,
[13:57.120 --> 13:59.120]  most of the folks in Amsterdam knew what it was.
[13:59.120 --> 14:01.720]  The people that were voting for them were mostly tourists
[14:01.720 --> 14:04.860]  and people that were not really familiar with the weed game.
[14:04.860 --> 14:05.880]  So all the people that,
[14:05.880 --> 14:07.520]  all the local Amsterdam had smoked it
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.200]  and they were like, hey, this is whatever's haze.
[14:09.200 --> 14:10.640]  They knew whose haze it was.
[14:10.660 --> 14:13.620]  They knew exactly, but these guys called it Ookie Kabookie
[14:13.620 --> 14:16.500]  and they fucking won a cannabis cup by stealing a strain,
[14:16.500 --> 14:19.220]  renaming it and entering it into the cup
[14:19.220 --> 14:21.020]  and then persuading other people to vote for it
[14:21.020 --> 14:23.300]  by kind of buying votes, by giving them weed,
[14:23.300 --> 14:26.020]  by talking to them, by kissing their asses.
[14:26.020 --> 14:28.020]  There's actually kind of a documentary on it
[14:28.020 --> 14:29.440]  if you want to Google it and look for it.
[14:29.440 --> 14:31.300]  Hold on, I'll go find the name for you.
[14:32.460 --> 14:33.940]  All right, you guys, I did a little bit of research.
[14:33.940 --> 14:35.820]  All I can find is some stuff on ICMag.
[14:35.820 --> 14:38.700]  Make sure you check out icmag.com, join the forum.
[14:38.720 --> 14:41.960]  It says, in 2007, Hager produced a reality TV show
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.200]  based around the High Times offices titled High Times Office.
[14:45.200 --> 14:48.360]  The show's 12th episode culminated in the 20th Cannabis Cup
[14:48.360 --> 14:50.220]  where Big Apple Seeds from Brooklyn, New York
[14:50.220 --> 14:52.840]  won a blind taste test against DNA seeds
[14:52.840 --> 14:55.000]  that was judged by Robert Connell Clark.
[14:55.000 --> 14:57.960]  It was later revealed in High Times that Doc and Dom,
[14:57.960 --> 14:59.800]  the owners of Big Apple Seeds were actors
[14:59.800 --> 15:01.720]  and their entry, Ookie Kabookie,
[15:01.720 --> 15:04.260]  was actually Neville's Haze purchased in Amsterdam
[15:04.360 --> 15:08.720]  from a pot broker with a good nose for good weed.
[15:08.720 --> 15:11.320]  So that was posted up on ICMag
[15:11.320 --> 15:13.880]  from a poster, calls himself Saluki.
[15:13.880 --> 15:16.100]  He looks like he's well-known on this place here.
[15:16.100 --> 15:18.520]  So a shout out, just read part of your post.
[15:18.520 --> 15:19.400]  You don't even know who I am.
[15:19.400 --> 15:21.600]  I don't know who you are, but you just got a shout out.
[15:21.600 --> 15:24.160]  So that is the legend of Ookie Kabookie and how that went.
[15:24.160 --> 15:25.760]  There were a lot of rumors on how that went down.
[15:25.760 --> 15:27.200]  That's just what I found on this one forum.
[15:27.200 --> 15:28.860]  It kind of brings back a lot of memories.
[15:28.860 --> 15:30.240]  So the original question was,
[15:30.240 --> 15:32.500]  can somebody steal a strain and rename it?
[15:32.500 --> 15:34.200]  Yes, they absolutely can.
[15:35.040 --> 15:36.180]  In this example, these people didn't even grow it.
[15:36.180 --> 15:38.580]  They bought it and then entered it into the cannabis cup
[15:38.580 --> 15:40.580]  and it was Neville's Haze, which is always gonna win.
[15:40.580 --> 15:41.780]  That's one of the best strains on the planet
[15:41.780 --> 15:42.780]  when grown properly.
[15:43.740 --> 15:44.860]  You guys have to take a quick drink.
[15:44.860 --> 15:45.760]  I'm gonna press pause.
[15:45.760 --> 15:47.020]  I'll be right back with you.
[15:47.020 --> 15:49.880]  All right, I am back.
[15:49.880 --> 15:51.800]  Before we get too far, I wanna give a huge shout out
[15:51.800 --> 15:53.780]  to our friends at Nugs in Denver.
[15:53.780 --> 15:55.820]  Nugs 303, Denver's newest dispensary.
[15:55.820 --> 15:58.660]  Make sure you check them out at 3899 Quentin Street
[15:58.660 --> 15:59.960]  in Denver, Colorado.
[15:59.960 --> 16:03.860]  They're open Monday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.
[16:04.520 --> 16:07.200]  They are currently only a medical cannabis facility.
[16:07.200 --> 16:09.920]  In the future, they will have a recreational side
[16:09.920 --> 16:10.880]  of the building.
[16:10.880 --> 16:13.920]  So we will be able to serve iRegenetics products
[16:13.920 --> 16:16.480]  to the entire recreational market.
[16:16.480 --> 16:17.540]  That is coming soon.
[16:17.540 --> 16:18.420]  Stay tuned for that.
[16:18.420 --> 16:20.240]  So big shout out to our friends at Nugs in Denver.
[16:20.240 --> 16:21.880]  Make sure you follow their Instagram.
[16:21.880 --> 16:24.320]  It is nugs.303.
[16:24.320 --> 16:26.720]  Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[16:26.720 --> 16:28.360]  All right, let's get on with the show.
[16:28.360 --> 16:30.720]  I've got another email from a listener.
[16:30.740 --> 16:34.060]  This one is a question about seed pack labeling
[16:34.060 --> 16:35.940]  and flowering times.
[16:35.940 --> 16:38.020]  Now when you're looking at seed packs online,
[16:38.020 --> 16:41.320]  you look at a package and it will say flowering time,
[16:41.320 --> 16:44.660]  usually 56 to 63 days is what most packages will say.
[16:44.660 --> 16:47.300]  Some will say 60 to 70 days.
[16:47.300 --> 16:49.220]  Hopefully they're writing the truth on there.
[16:49.220 --> 16:50.640]  But usually it's eight to nine weeks
[16:50.640 --> 16:53.500]  and they'll indicate that by the number of days.
[16:53.500 --> 16:57.000]  Now what that number is, is the flowering time,
[16:57.000 --> 16:58.680]  unless you've got auto flowering plants.
[16:58.700 --> 17:01.460]  If you've got auto flower plants, this does not apply.
[17:01.460 --> 17:04.820]  But if you've got regular photo period plants,
[17:04.820 --> 17:07.300]  this is what that number means.
[17:07.300 --> 17:09.660]  When a breeder labels his package of seeds
[17:09.660 --> 17:12.440]  and it says that this plant takes whatever,
[17:12.440 --> 17:16.140]  eight to nine weeks or 56 to 63 days to finish,
[17:16.140 --> 17:17.640]  that is the flowering time.
[17:17.640 --> 17:19.540]  That's how long that plant is going to take
[17:19.540 --> 17:22.140]  to reach full maturity from the time
[17:22.140 --> 17:24.580]  you initiate the flowering period.
[17:24.580 --> 17:27.580]  And that is when from the very first day
[17:27.580 --> 17:29.960]  you turn that timer to 12-12.
[17:29.960 --> 17:33.200]  When the lights go from 12 hours on to 12 hours off,
[17:33.200 --> 17:36.180]  that is now day one of that phase.
[17:36.180 --> 17:38.420]  That nine week period that's written on the package
[17:38.420 --> 17:40.600]  has nothing to do with your veg cycle.
[17:40.600 --> 17:44.060]  You can veg those plants, you can sprout them as seedlings,
[17:44.060 --> 17:45.660]  you can get them like two inches tall,
[17:45.660 --> 17:47.820]  and then you can flower them if you want to.
[17:47.820 --> 17:49.320]  So that could be 20 days.
[17:49.320 --> 17:53.120]  Or you can sprout them, you can veg them for 12 weeks
[17:53.120 --> 17:55.040]  and take a million clones and then flower.
[17:55.040 --> 17:56.560]  I don't know what you're gonna do with the plants.
[17:56.580 --> 17:58.260]  The breeder doesn't know either.
[17:58.260 --> 17:59.140]  You're the only one that knows
[17:59.140 --> 18:00.100]  what you're gonna do with that.
[18:00.100 --> 18:03.540]  So the veg time is as long as you want it to be, okay?
[18:03.540 --> 18:06.400]  The flowering time is what is indicated on the package
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.360]  and it begins the day you turn those lights to 12-12.
[18:10.360 --> 18:12.340]  So if that breeder pack says that their plants
[18:12.340 --> 18:14.780]  are going to take 56 to 63 days,
[18:14.780 --> 18:17.580]  I usually recommend going the full 63 days
[18:17.580 --> 18:19.180]  unless it's completely obvious
[18:19.180 --> 18:21.380]  that that plant is going to be done earlier.
[18:21.380 --> 18:22.740]  Because of course some phenotypes
[18:22.740 --> 18:23.800]  are going to finish sooner,
[18:23.800 --> 18:25.840]  some are gonna finish a little bit later.
[18:25.860 --> 18:27.020]  I like to push them.
[18:27.020 --> 18:28.260]  I like to see what they're going to do.
[18:28.260 --> 18:30.700]  Sometimes a plant won't start putting on its bulk
[18:30.700 --> 18:32.080]  until the last couple of weeks.
[18:32.080 --> 18:34.020]  You might be cutting yourself out of some weight.
[18:34.020 --> 18:36.100]  You might be cutting yourself out of potency.
[18:36.100 --> 18:38.100]  Sometimes those plants will just throw on a whole
[18:38.100 --> 18:40.340]  another layer of trichomes right at the end.
[18:40.340 --> 18:41.740]  You never know what you might be missing
[18:41.740 --> 18:42.780]  if you cut down too early.
[18:42.780 --> 18:45.300]  So if the package says that it could go nine weeks,
[18:45.300 --> 18:47.700]  let it go nine full weeks on the first run.
[18:47.700 --> 18:49.740]  And then hopefully you've got clones.
[18:49.740 --> 18:51.780]  So now you get to pick your favorite phenotype
[18:51.780 --> 18:52.660]  out of that seed pack.
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.120]  You get to run it again.
[18:54.120 --> 18:56.380]  And then you get to dial in exactly how many days
[18:56.380 --> 18:58.300]  to flower that plant for.
[18:58.300 --> 18:59.780]  Sometimes your first run with the plant
[18:59.780 --> 19:00.820]  is just an experiment.
[19:00.820 --> 19:02.740]  You gotta see what it's gonna do.
[19:02.740 --> 19:04.220]  So that's my take on that.
[19:04.220 --> 19:05.540]  The time indicated on the pack
[19:05.540 --> 19:07.580]  is how long the plant will flower.
[19:07.580 --> 19:10.380]  So keep that in mind when you're purchasing your seeds.
[19:10.380 --> 19:12.420]  If you're looking for a reputable seed vendor
[19:12.420 --> 19:13.260]  in the United States,
[19:13.260 --> 19:15.780]  I would recommend thedankteam.com.
[19:15.780 --> 19:18.900]  The D-A-N-K-T-E-A-M.com.
[19:18.900 --> 19:20.220]  Thedankteam.com.
[19:20.220 --> 19:22.260]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[19:22.260 --> 19:25.080]  They have got things from Gage Green Genetics,
[19:25.080 --> 19:27.640]  Sour Seeds, Mile High, Canaventure.
[19:27.640 --> 19:28.880]  They got a lot of great stuff on there.
[19:28.880 --> 19:31.280]  They may even have some Irie Genetics.
[19:31.280 --> 19:32.980]  I'm not sure what's available.
[19:32.980 --> 19:35.400]  You'll have to go and take a look for yourself.
[19:35.400 --> 19:39.840]  So let's move on to another question.
[19:39.840 --> 19:42.040]  This question actually came from a friend of mine.
[19:42.040 --> 19:42.960]  Shout out to Los.
[19:42.960 --> 19:44.920]  I hope you're listening to this.
[19:44.920 --> 19:46.780]  There is a cultivar, there is a clone,
[19:46.780 --> 19:48.960]  there's a varietal, there is a stream,
[19:48.960 --> 19:51.160]  there's a plant that goes around our region
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.060]  that is a sour diesel clone.
[19:55.060 --> 19:57.260]  And when it is grown properly,
[19:57.260 --> 20:00.660]  you cannot keep it in a baggie, in a jar.
[20:00.660 --> 20:03.600]  You can't put it in a baggie inside of a jar.
[20:03.600 --> 20:05.980]  You can't hide this weed from anybody.
[20:05.980 --> 20:08.660]  If you put it in a baggie, in a jar, and in your car,
[20:08.660 --> 20:11.740]  you can smell this sour diesel outside of the car.
[20:11.740 --> 20:13.520]  This shit is potent.
[20:13.520 --> 20:16.100]  This is some super loud weed.
[20:16.100 --> 20:17.580]  This shit is crazy.
[20:17.580 --> 20:20.580]  But when I give it to a lot of my friends,
[20:20.580 --> 20:21.640]  they cannot grow it.
[20:21.640 --> 20:24.780]  I myself cannot grow this strain worth a shit.
[20:24.780 --> 20:27.160]  I know three or four people that grow this strain
[20:27.160 --> 20:28.560]  fucking amazingly.
[20:28.560 --> 20:29.500]  It comes out beautifully.
[20:29.500 --> 20:31.680]  The calyxes swell up, it's covered in resin,
[20:31.680 --> 20:34.880]  it gets that gassy fuel funk smell to it.
[20:34.880 --> 20:37.920]  So me being the inquisitive guy that I am,
[20:39.060 --> 20:40.280]  I know a few guys that grow it.
[20:40.280 --> 20:41.360]  So I asked them, I was like,
[20:41.360 --> 20:43.920]  hey, how do you grow that sour diesel?
[20:43.920 --> 20:46.340]  And all three of the people that grow it successfully
[20:46.340 --> 20:48.220]  have told me that it grows
[20:48.220 --> 20:51.320]  in some type of a hydroponic system.
[20:51.320 --> 20:53.840]  So what that leads me to think,
[20:53.840 --> 20:55.720]  these guys, myself included,
[20:55.720 --> 20:58.560]  that are trying to grow this cultivar, this clone,
[20:58.560 --> 21:01.800]  this varietal, this plant, this strain,
[21:01.800 --> 21:03.880]  in a soil or soilless mix,
[21:03.880 --> 21:05.840]  we're not gonna have much success
[21:05.840 --> 21:08.360]  because this plant was probably phenohunted
[21:08.360 --> 21:12.280]  from a pack of seeds by somebody that grows in hydro.
[21:12.280 --> 21:15.800]  This plant was selected for a hydroponic system.
[21:15.800 --> 21:17.080]  I don't think anybody growing it,
[21:17.300 --> 21:18.460]  and this could be wrong,
[21:18.460 --> 21:21.060]  but I don't think most of the people growing it in soil
[21:21.060 --> 21:24.540]  are ever going to bring out that flavor and aroma
[21:24.540 --> 21:27.020]  that my friends in the hydroponic system are getting
[21:27.020 --> 21:30.220]  because I feel like some plants like hydro
[21:30.220 --> 21:31.720]  and some plants like soil.
[21:31.720 --> 21:35.980]  And this is a perfect example of phenotypical expression.
[21:37.160 --> 21:39.940]  The grower that found this plant probably grows hydro.
[21:39.940 --> 21:42.700]  So he thought, look at this amazing plant that I've got.
[21:42.700 --> 21:44.300]  And then he gave it to all of us soil growers
[21:44.300 --> 21:45.940]  and we're just frustrated.
[21:45.960 --> 21:47.280]  We're so angry.
[21:47.280 --> 21:49.100]  So that is my opinion.
[21:49.100 --> 21:50.760]  I think that some strains,
[21:50.760 --> 21:52.840]  and I keep saying all these different words,
[21:52.840 --> 21:54.920]  and they're known as different things in different circles.
[21:54.920 --> 21:56.240]  People will call them varietals
[21:56.240 --> 21:58.060]  and you'll hear cultivar also.
[21:58.060 --> 21:59.920]  I'll say strains or clones.
[21:59.920 --> 22:01.860]  Some strains or clones or plants
[22:01.860 --> 22:04.400]  are just not simply going to work.
[22:04.400 --> 22:07.480]  And I'm sure that if you took one of my soil plants
[22:07.480 --> 22:10.160]  and you tried to grow that in a hydroponic system,
[22:10.160 --> 22:12.200]  you may not have as stellar results
[22:12.200 --> 22:13.680]  as you would have in soil.
[22:13.680 --> 22:15.600]  It's just some plants are going to like some things.
[22:16.260 --> 22:17.100]  So that's my opinion.
[22:17.100 --> 22:18.460]  That's what I think is going on with that plant.
[22:18.460 --> 22:20.540]  So shout out to Lowe's for asking me that.
[22:20.540 --> 22:21.900]  I kind of told him the same thing
[22:21.900 --> 22:23.160]  and he scratched his head and looked at me
[22:23.160 --> 22:24.360]  like I was a genius.
[22:24.360 --> 22:27.860]  I thought I would share that with you guys.
[22:27.860 --> 22:30.220]  All right, I feel like that's enough emails for this episode.
[22:30.220 --> 22:31.220]  I've got a couple more emails
[22:31.220 --> 22:33.080]  that I will read on a future episode.
[22:33.080 --> 22:35.340]  I feel like if I get into one of them today,
[22:35.340 --> 22:37.820]  it will be way too long of a show.
[22:37.820 --> 22:38.780]  Oh wait, there is one email
[22:38.780 --> 22:41.100]  I can definitely reply to right now.
[22:41.100 --> 22:44.280]  Somebody sent me an email asking about cannabis and sex.
[22:44.300 --> 22:47.540]  They said, can you talk about cannabis and sex?
[22:47.540 --> 22:49.900]  Here is my take on cannabis and sex.
[22:51.240 --> 22:52.260]  Do that shit.
[22:53.540 --> 22:55.260]  All right, somebody else also sent me an email
[22:55.260 --> 22:57.160]  about cannabis and pregnancy.
[22:57.160 --> 22:58.980]  They wanted to know about the pros and cons
[22:58.980 --> 23:01.040]  and the advantages and disadvantages
[23:01.040 --> 23:03.040]  of cannabis use during pregnancy.
[23:03.040 --> 23:05.700]  Honestly, I am not well-educated in that subject.
[23:05.700 --> 23:07.540]  So I am going to do some research
[23:07.540 --> 23:08.960]  and I will try to get you an episode
[23:08.960 --> 23:12.240]  that features a little bit about cannabis and pregnancy.
[23:12.260 --> 23:14.960]  I'll get that out to you in the future.
[23:14.960 --> 23:16.440]  Try to do it soon because it sounds like
[23:16.440 --> 23:17.940]  somebody might be pregnant right now.
[23:17.940 --> 23:19.820]  Congratulations, I hope that goes well.
[23:19.820 --> 23:21.920]  I hope mama is happy, hope the baby's healthy
[23:21.920 --> 23:23.860]  and I hope daddy is doing well.
[23:23.860 --> 23:26.060]  All right, that pretty much wraps up this episode, you guys.
[23:26.060 --> 23:27.380]  If you see me at the secret sesh,
[23:27.380 --> 23:29.860]  please introduce yourself, shake my hand, say hello.
[23:29.860 --> 23:31.100]  Give me a fat dab.
[23:31.100 --> 23:32.260]  I'd love to meet you.
[23:32.260 --> 23:33.680]  Tell me what you think of the podcast.
[23:33.680 --> 23:36.140]  I may have a microphone and a recording device with me.
[23:36.140 --> 23:38.780]  So we may be able to do some recording if you're interested.
[23:38.780 --> 23:40.060]  I would love to meet you.
[23:40.060 --> 23:41.980]  I hope everybody has a great 420.
[23:42.720 --> 23:44.720]  I hope you've had a great 420 weekend so far.
[23:44.720 --> 23:46.160]  Now that the show is over, you guys,

[24:41.600 --> 24:43.480]  So, big shout out to my ninja spence.
[24:43.480 --> 24:46.180]  And until next time, take a fat dab
[24:46.180 --> 24:59.080]  and give your mom a hug for me.
[24:59.080 --> 25:01.200]  ♫ Chronics left, right
[25:01.200 --> 25:04.460]  ♫ Just soldiers that come left, right
