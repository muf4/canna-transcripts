[00:14.840 --> 00:17.540]  Yeah. Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:17.540 --> 00:20.980]  It's time for episode number two 83 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:21.220 --> 00:25.140]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:25.140 --> 00:27.100]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.140 --> 00:29.220]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.620 --> 00:32.660]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:32.660 --> 00:36.180]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:37.260 --> 00:39.100]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.100 --> 00:41.700]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me as always.
[00:41.720 --> 00:44.460]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the mystic roots
[00:44.720 --> 00:47.960]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big shout out to Kat,
[00:48.680 --> 00:53.600]  Koon and the entire mystic roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:53.600 --> 00:54.480]  thanks again for joining me.
[00:54.480 --> 00:57.640]  I usually like to start off the podcast by talking about what I'm smoking on
[00:58.160 --> 01:01.640]  today. I am dabbing on some stuff that I have named fireberry.
[01:01.920 --> 01:04.080]  And we'll talk about that more on the podcast.
[01:05.680 --> 01:09.320]  This podcast was recorded live in Colorado Springs at the studio,
[01:09.320 --> 01:12.600]  a 64 smoke lounge. And I was joined by my friends, Jeremy and Cheryl,
[01:12.940 --> 01:15.140]  who are also known as love for the plant on Instagram.
[01:15.160 --> 01:18.820]  So please check them out. This episode was over an hour long,
[01:18.960 --> 01:22.020]  so I'm going to cut the intro short and we're just going to roll right into the
[01:22.020 --> 01:24.500]  recording with Jeremy and Cheryl. Thanks for listening. You guys.
[01:28.290 --> 01:30.930]  Thanks for joining me, you guys. Yeah. Thank you for having us.
[01:31.370 --> 01:35.810]  So to start off, we just smoked some of this concentrate.
[01:35.810 --> 01:38.170]  You guys brought me, this is some live resin.
[01:38.250 --> 01:42.370]  It is 75% firefly and 25% member berry.
[01:42.390 --> 01:45.750]  I have named it fireberry. It's from our friends, love for the plant.
[01:45.790 --> 01:49.230]  They grew it in their little compact grow that we're going to talk about here
[01:49.230 --> 01:52.870]  in a minute. Can we reveal who did the extraction or should that remain an
[01:52.870 --> 01:53.690]  anonymous?
[01:53.710 --> 01:57.710]  I wouldn't know the best way of calling him out right now. Okay.
[01:57.750 --> 02:02.630]  Well then a very skilled extractor made some great concentrates out of their
[02:02.630 --> 02:04.670]  flower. Of course I bred the firefly.
[02:04.690 --> 02:07.710]  Our friend Colin at the ethos collective made the member berry.
[02:07.990 --> 02:11.430]  I just took a dab of this concentrate and I think I described it as the
[02:11.450 --> 02:15.810]  strawberry Kiwi or something with mangoes in it from Snapple.
[02:16.050 --> 02:19.130]  If there's a strawberry Kiwi mango Snapple, that's what it would be,
[02:19.130 --> 02:22.930]  but I don't think that's real. Uh, but it definitely had a strawberry Kiwi flavor.
[02:23.330 --> 02:25.170]  Uh, remember, uh, those candies,
[02:25.170 --> 02:28.250]  their strawberries and grandma had them in the little coffee dish and it had a
[02:28.250 --> 02:31.050]  strawberry wrapper and he'd bite into it in the middle would get kind of gooey.
[02:31.490 --> 02:35.130]  That's kind of what it reminded me of, but more of a tropical thing. So man,
[02:35.130 --> 02:39.170]  great job on that. And thank you for the amazing gift. Our pleasure.
[02:40.150 --> 02:42.790]  Uh, so that was grown. I'm just going to kind of say,
[02:42.790 --> 02:45.030]  I've got a couple of notes. I'm just going to segue right into it.
[02:45.230 --> 02:48.070]  That was grown in a very, very small grow.
[02:48.070 --> 02:49.550]  You just showed me pictures of that grow.
[02:49.790 --> 02:52.110]  Is that a four by four tent that that was flowered in?
[02:52.150 --> 02:54.750]  It is a two by four tent. That's a two by four tent.
[02:54.770 --> 02:58.350]  You've got it packed with buds. I just saw towering buds through the whole thing.
[02:58.670 --> 03:03.070]  Yes. Good work in such a small tent. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. It's, uh,
[03:03.350 --> 03:08.230]  we are on our seventh grow now. Seventh grow. Okay. In that tent, in that tent.
[03:08.330 --> 03:11.050]  What's a, what's your average weight coming out of a two by four tent?
[03:11.050 --> 03:14.610]  If you don't mind me asking. Average, average, just under a pound.
[03:15.610 --> 03:19.530]  But you know, we've gotten over a pound. So with that super silver Hayes,
[03:19.530 --> 03:22.930]  we got over a pound. That's excellent. We're super silver. Hey, okay. Yeah.
[03:22.930 --> 03:25.210]  That's the team will give you some extra weight for sure. Yeah.
[03:25.250 --> 03:29.090]  How was the quality of that one? Uh, well I had some Fox telling at the end.
[03:29.170 --> 03:32.450]  So super silver Hayes will do that almost no matter what you do. Oh, okay.
[03:32.470 --> 03:34.610]  Yeah. She's going to do that. Yeah. She'll, that's just what kind of,
[03:34.650 --> 03:37.770]  kind of what a Hayes will do because she's from a tropical environment. Uh,
[03:37.830 --> 03:38.870]  she doesn't want to get sweaty.
[03:38.890 --> 03:41.370]  So she'll spread out to keep herself from getting mildewy.
[03:41.390 --> 03:43.870]  So she's helping you out by doing that. Yeah. We took, uh,
[03:43.910 --> 03:48.230]  the flavor of it came out a little bit more earthy than what we were looking for.
[03:48.750 --> 03:50.070]  Um, but you know, that's just our taste.
[03:50.150 --> 03:52.590]  We're going to talk about flavors here pretty soon because Cheryl had some
[03:52.590 --> 03:56.030]  questions about flavors. I liked the way you approached that. Uh,
[03:56.070 --> 03:58.030]  so have you guys heard the episode I was talking about,
[03:58.070 --> 04:02.750]  about the buds with the more surface area or have potential to have more, uh,
[04:02.790 --> 04:05.630]  THC because there's more surface area. I did hear that one.
[04:05.650 --> 04:10.050]  That's why I think hazes and things like that seem to get you a little higher.
[04:10.330 --> 04:13.930]  There's a little more space for more trichomes. That's what's fingering out a
[04:13.930 --> 04:16.570]  little bit. Yeah. I compared it to imagine if you close your,
[04:16.610 --> 04:18.370]  your fist and dunked it into some, uh,
[04:18.410 --> 04:21.010]  powdered sugar and you only have this much space for trichome,
[04:21.290 --> 04:23.210]  then you open your hand and dunk it into powdered sugar.
[04:23.250 --> 04:26.090]  Now you have that extra space. Yeah. So that's what I'm thinking.
[04:26.090 --> 04:28.610]  The that's why the Hayes Fox tailed out like that a little bit and give you a
[04:28.610 --> 04:32.970]  little more room. Yeah. They added weights, added the extra weight. Nice.
[04:33.130 --> 04:34.730]  I feel like I might be getting a buzzing in my headphone,
[04:34.750 --> 04:36.910]  but if it's in the recording, I can fix it later. Uh,
[04:36.910 --> 04:40.630]  so that was done in a very small garden at two by four, you get over a pound.
[04:40.870 --> 04:42.510]  What kind of lights are you using in there? Yeah.
[04:42.510 --> 04:47.190]  So I have two different LEDs at the moment. I'm doing a, uh,
[04:47.470 --> 04:51.910]  advanced platinum LED. They call it the P 300. It's actually,
[04:51.910 --> 04:56.910]  it actually pulls like 185 Watts. Um, and then I'm also used on the other side.
[04:57.870 --> 05:01.590]  I have, Oh, by the way, let me back up on that advanced LED.
[05:01.610 --> 05:03.130]  It's all three watt diodes.
[05:03.850 --> 05:07.250]  And on the other led that I've just recently moved to,
[05:07.250 --> 05:12.250]  it's a company called advanced led on advanced platinum led,
[05:12.630 --> 05:17.250]  but just advanced led. They're actually a company out of Arkansas. Um,
[05:17.370 --> 05:19.610]  pure coincidence that I'm from. We're going to talk about that. Yeah.
[05:21.290 --> 05:24.610]  But anyways, um, that, that light has the 10 watt, uh,
[05:24.610 --> 05:29.610]  Cree diodes or led or bulbs, I should say the 10, 10 watt Cree bulbs.
[05:30.590 --> 05:32.430]  And I really liked that mixed in with the three.
[05:32.430 --> 05:34.590]  While I feel like that offers a better,
[05:35.790 --> 05:38.790]  produces better than another side. Um, you know,
[05:38.790 --> 05:43.790]  I haven't seen a noticeable difference in yield or quality between the two
[05:44.310 --> 05:49.650]  lights, but I do feel like I, I, it most almost just makes me feel better.
[05:49.710 --> 05:54.270]  Knowing that I have a mix of having those Cree bulbs mixed in with those three
[05:54.450 --> 05:57.390]  watt bulbs, the more, uh, the more colors, the better. Oh.
[05:57.410 --> 06:01.090]  And I'll also say those Cree bulbs offer the white light,
[06:01.370 --> 06:05.610]  whereas the other led, you know, it's that purple and yeah.
[06:05.690 --> 06:08.450]  Your photos are pretty cool. I like the colors from the lights in your photos.
[06:08.490 --> 06:09.850]  They definitely are. Yeah, it looks cool.
[06:10.930 --> 06:14.250]  So I'm kind of impressed that you're pulling that from led lights. Uh,
[06:14.250 --> 06:16.250]  can I ask what your light bill is every month from that?
[06:17.410 --> 06:18.250]  Go ahead, Cheryl.
[06:18.770 --> 06:23.770]  I pay the electricity bill and we have not paid over $91 and that's for our
[06:24.750 --> 06:28.150]  entire apartment that is with, um,
[06:28.270 --> 06:32.470]  you running the AC or running the heater, vegging, flowering,
[06:32.830 --> 06:35.230]  and all throughout the year. And we're on our seventh grow.
[06:35.350 --> 06:37.590]  And I haven't paid over $91 a month yet.
[06:37.710 --> 06:39.990]  That's super impressive because when I tell my friends that are,
[06:40.150 --> 06:42.390]  are setting up a new grow and they're going to run an HPS light,
[06:42.390 --> 06:43.230]  like a thousand watt,
[06:43.390 --> 06:47.350]  I tell them to expect a $100 a month increase for the light,
[06:47.370 --> 06:49.830]  the fan and whatever cooling it's going to take to keep that cool.
[06:49.850 --> 06:53.630]  So $91 and you're pulling a pound every crop. That's pretty impressive. Yeah.
[06:54.070 --> 06:56.990]  Can I talk about your veg space? Absolutely.
[06:57.010 --> 06:59.870]  That you just showed me a picture of your veg space. Uh,
[06:59.910 --> 07:01.510]  and I can edit this part out if I need to.
[07:02.190 --> 07:05.950]  You told me that you had your mom visiting and she had no idea that you were
[07:05.950 --> 07:09.190]  vegging in your living room basically. Yeah, it was Cheryl's mother.
[07:10.470 --> 07:13.510]  Yeah. Yeah. It was really cool. Um, you know, my mom,
[07:13.670 --> 07:17.670]  she's very in support of us, but it wasn't until she actually visited where,
[07:17.670 --> 07:19.190]  you know, it really made sense to her.
[07:19.450 --> 07:24.330]  So she comes in and in our living room we have this, you know,
[07:24.370 --> 07:28.330]  your very basic, pretty armoire that you order off of Amazon.
[07:28.650 --> 07:33.650]  And so it looks like when you open in maybe a TV in there and you couldn't like
[07:33.770 --> 07:35.090]  hear or smell anything.
[07:35.090 --> 07:38.890]  And my mom obviously noticed this beautiful new addition to our living room.
[07:39.170 --> 07:42.370]  And then after she was there for a while, I was like, mom, come check this out.
[07:42.570 --> 07:43.530]  And you open it. It's like,
[07:44.450 --> 07:47.570]  and it's like all this beautiful green goodness and smell.
[07:47.590 --> 07:49.550]  And she could not believe it.
[07:49.870 --> 07:50.910]  When you showed me the pictures,
[07:50.930 --> 07:54.030]  I was impressed and I've seen a lot of grows and grown a lot myself.
[07:54.150 --> 07:57.870]  It looks like you went to a pier one and got a little armoire and put it in the
[07:57.870 --> 07:59.470]  living room, put some flowers on top of it.
[07:59.470 --> 08:01.830]  It looks like you'd open it and there'd probably be, you know,
[08:01.830 --> 08:05.270]  I'd expect some CDs in there. The things that you hide, you know,
[08:05.270 --> 08:07.030]  the crap you don't want everyone to see when they come over,
[08:07.030 --> 08:10.150]  like all your art supplies, whatever, just cram it all into there.
[08:10.430 --> 08:13.910]  You open it up and it's got a little hydro set up with two spots.
[08:13.910 --> 08:14.990]  Do you put hydro buckets in there?
[08:14.990 --> 08:16.550]  Actually that's not hydro. That's okay.
[08:16.550 --> 08:19.170]  That's a cutout for the containers to sit down in.
[08:19.210 --> 08:22.050]  That is so smart. So they're not sitting on the floor. They hover in there.
[08:22.090 --> 08:24.610]  Correct. All right. Pull them out. That is genius.
[08:24.610 --> 08:29.170]  And then you got you an led light up on top, a platinum, the platinum led.
[08:29.170 --> 08:31.530]  I can't read much more. And then you got your carbon filter up there.
[08:32.150 --> 08:33.930]  And so all that's running and mom had no idea.
[08:34.570 --> 08:37.410]  Yeah. I mean, it was just kind of like light white noise is what,
[08:37.410 --> 08:40.370]  how I would describe it. Um, especially if you just have, you know,
[08:40.370 --> 08:43.970]  everyone's excited or talking or the TV's on, you know, lightly,
[08:43.970 --> 08:46.190]  or even music, something like that.
[08:46.430 --> 08:49.670]  You really don't pay attention or even if the AC is running at the same time,
[08:49.830 --> 08:52.830]  you might just confuse it for the house AC. Yeah. That's pretty smooth.
[08:52.870 --> 08:55.190]  It's pretty incognito there. Stealth little grow. All right.
[08:55.190 --> 08:57.030]  So just keep it quiet. No one would even notice.
[08:57.390 --> 08:59.110]  How did you guys keep the odor down and flower?
[08:59.710 --> 09:02.430]  It's just carbon filters like normal. The fresh filter does it.
[09:02.510 --> 09:05.150]  The fresh filter does it. Do you work for them?
[09:05.350 --> 09:08.110]  Grab the mic closer to your face as Joe Rogan would say, eat that thing.
[09:10.270 --> 09:12.510]  Yeah. Say that again. Say that, give that quote again.
[09:12.530 --> 09:13.370]  So you can get paid for that one.
[09:14.850 --> 09:19.810]  The fresh filter takes care of 100% of the odor. I mean, I'm sure,
[09:19.930 --> 09:23.530]  you know, microscopic scientifically, it's not a hundred percent,
[09:23.850 --> 09:26.850]  but we don't even get a hint of it when we had,
[09:27.050 --> 09:30.730]  when we are replacing them as often as you know, as recommended.
[09:32.170 --> 09:36.690]  Good work. Good work. All right. So we wanted to segue, I was gonna,
[09:36.810 --> 09:39.330]  do you want to tell us any more about your girl? Don't let me skip out on anything.
[09:39.330 --> 09:40.530]  It's a great little girl. I'm impressed.
[09:40.950 --> 09:43.750]  I will talk about the contrast between the, you know,
[09:43.750 --> 09:45.830]  modifying existing furniture, you know,
[09:45.830 --> 09:50.350]  the benefit of modifying existing furniture to be a gross space is it flows with
[09:50.350 --> 09:54.790]  the natural environment. And so it's a little bit more stealth,
[09:54.810 --> 09:57.030]  but I will warn everyone. It's a lot of work.
[09:57.030 --> 10:01.150]  You can tell that you're drilling holes for ventilation.
[10:01.310 --> 10:03.430]  Of course you have to align the entire thing.
[10:04.150 --> 10:08.150]  There are so many things to take into account, light deprivation to,
[10:08.170 --> 10:11.010]  you would be surprised, especially with this cheap furniture,
[10:11.010 --> 10:13.970]  how hard it is to keep a hundred percent of the light out.
[10:14.210 --> 10:17.370]  People don't understand what 100% of the light means.
[10:18.130 --> 10:22.890]  They think that a little bit of light means 100% dark and no dark all the way
[10:22.890 --> 10:23.730]  dark. You guys.
[10:23.810 --> 10:26.650]  Yeah. So, you know, the, the, the, the clear disadvantages,
[10:26.690 --> 10:30.490]  it's a lot of work to design. The advantages,
[10:30.810 --> 10:34.090]  advantage is it's going to be as stealth as you want it to be.
[10:34.630 --> 10:38.790]  Whereas the tent it's ready to go. Plug and play.
[10:38.790 --> 10:43.030]  You have your ports ready. You know, your ventilation ports,
[10:43.190 --> 10:46.670]  your things to hang your lights from everything is ready to go.
[10:46.690 --> 10:49.910]  There's no work, but you're losing a little bit of stealth.
[10:50.550 --> 10:55.230]  Yeah. Actually you bring up a great point though with the, yes,
[10:55.230 --> 10:57.990]  it looks like a tent, but if the tent is small enough,
[10:58.010 --> 10:59.370]  grab the mic too. Cause you're about to go important.
[10:59.370 --> 11:03.050]  I want to hear this part. Yeah. If the tent is small enough, two by four,
[11:03.050 --> 11:04.210]  I'd say smaller, you know,
[11:04.210 --> 11:08.430]  we're two by four is as big as I would want to go if you want to remain stealth.
[11:08.970 --> 11:11.810]  But we just stack boxes on top of it around it.
[11:12.050 --> 11:14.930]  Just make it look like clutter and it works great.
[11:14.970 --> 11:16.250]  We've distract the eye.
[11:17.850 --> 11:21.730]  Any type of like cloth closet that you could buy at bed,
[11:21.730 --> 11:25.570]  bath and beyond store extra clothes in. It looks exactly like that. I mean,
[11:25.590 --> 11:29.750]  it's almost the same. The zipper is in the same direction, you know,
[11:29.750 --> 11:33.390]  so it's very incognito and it's black. So you can just blend it in.
[11:33.390 --> 11:34.510]  If you put some towels near it.
[11:35.350 --> 11:37.390]  Actually this one more small point,
[11:37.430 --> 11:41.790]  something I've learned is I bought a very cheap tent on Amazon.
[11:41.790 --> 11:46.310]  It was like, you know, I think I paid $50 for this two by four.
[11:47.050 --> 11:52.050]  And it's the drawback of those cheap tents is they will have a small light
[11:52.150 --> 11:55.670]  leaks. You buy a girl, grow tent. It's great,
[11:55.910 --> 11:59.310]  but they're two $300 for an equal equivalent size.
[11:59.310 --> 12:01.950]  Half light leaks sometimes. Oh, that's good to know. Okay.
[12:02.150 --> 12:06.710]  So I found, or at least what we are doing, if you are on a budget,
[12:07.650 --> 12:11.990]  just buy a cheap tent and then buy a $10 black sheet to lay over it.
[12:12.310 --> 12:15.430]  We just keep that sheet laid over it. And then when I go to open up the tent,
[12:15.710 --> 12:19.590]  just raise the sheet up, unzip the tent. And you know,
[12:19.610 --> 12:23.370]  so for $50 for the grow tent, $10 for a sheet.
[12:23.770 --> 12:26.090]  And I have a great tent solution.
[12:26.090 --> 12:29.450]  You're pulling out a pound every 60 days. It looks like every 70 days.
[12:30.610 --> 12:35.370]  My big biggest expense was buying high end led. Um, you, you know,
[12:35.430 --> 12:39.650]  obviously there are many options for led out there and I chose the higher end.
[12:39.650 --> 12:41.450]  So that was clearly my biggest expense.
[12:41.610 --> 12:44.130]  And it looks like it was worth the extra investment cause you're pulling a great
[12:44.130 --> 12:46.350]  crop. Oh, absolutely. I mean, if you want top shelf,
[12:46.350 --> 12:49.290]  you have to pay for it with led. Do you guys hear that?
[12:49.290 --> 12:52.330]  If you want top shelf, you have to pay for it. That's with everything,
[12:52.330 --> 12:56.050]  not just with led. That's everything. Don't cheap out. You guys. People say,
[12:56.070 --> 12:58.970]  well, those nutrients are too expensive. Look at the product I'm growing.
[12:59.450 --> 13:01.530]  That's that's what's stopping you spend the money.
[13:01.930 --> 13:04.730]  It's only a few cents more to people don't realize that. All right.
[13:05.130 --> 13:07.650]  What else you got for me on a small grow, bro? I love your tips.
[13:08.250 --> 13:10.810]  There was actually a listener that asked for stealth grow tips and I didn't
[13:10.810 --> 13:12.690]  realize I was going to get so much on this episode.
[13:12.810 --> 13:15.810]  So this is great for me and him. Yeah. I mean, that's about it. Um,
[13:15.810 --> 13:18.710]  the only thing I would say as far as your grow medium,
[13:19.070 --> 13:23.310]  your options are about the same as any other indoor grow. Um, I'm choosing,
[13:23.550 --> 13:25.350]  I'm growing in five gallon containers.
[13:25.550 --> 13:29.750]  Thinking about going to seven because I am, I'm using a high quality soil.
[13:29.750 --> 13:33.150]  I'm trying to keep a, a pro microbial
[13:34.430 --> 13:36.110]  environment in there. I'm not doing no tilling.
[13:36.110 --> 13:37.430]  Are you hand watering or are you doing any?
[13:37.430 --> 13:40.790]  I'm hand watering. Okay. Yeah. All right. Excellent. So, um, so yeah,
[13:40.790 --> 13:43.630]  I think I'm going to the larger containers just to, um,
[13:43.650 --> 13:46.330]  support some of that organic matter a little bit better. Okay.
[13:46.450 --> 13:49.330]  I'm still learning about all that. I'll also be watering less. Yes.
[13:49.370 --> 13:53.290]  Yeah. Less frequently. Cause I have an area to keep alive. Yeah. I like,
[13:53.330 --> 13:56.330]  that's what I like about seven gallon pots is I have to water them on Monday and
[13:56.330 --> 13:59.250]  then maybe Thursday. Right. And then Monday again and Thursday you get two
[13:59.250 --> 14:01.090]  waterings a week. So, and then, you know, two,
[14:01.090 --> 14:03.290]  seven gallon pots in a two by four tent.
[14:03.770 --> 14:06.370]  Then I sometimes wonder why don't I just put a big bed in here?
[14:06.370 --> 14:08.570]  Just make this whole tent a big no till bed.
[14:09.450 --> 14:11.410]  That's what a lot of my friends would tell you to do.
[14:11.710 --> 14:13.670]  Barefoot would say that's what Frosty would say.
[14:14.070 --> 14:15.910]  Sean's probably going do it, just do it.
[14:16.190 --> 14:17.990]  They're all yelling right now chanting for you to do it.
[14:18.110 --> 14:22.870]  But you know, being in a, in a small apartment, that's just, you know,
[14:22.870 --> 14:25.470]  the predatory mites and everything in an apartment. If I had my,
[14:25.670 --> 14:28.150]  had my own home, it would be different, but.
[14:28.710 --> 14:31.830]  I think it would all contain itself. I don't think. Yeah. Well,
[14:32.270 --> 14:35.790]  this is not my area of expertise in any way, but, uh,
[14:35.790 --> 14:40.310]  I have a personal grow and I use predatory mites in my personal grow because I
[14:40.310 --> 14:43.930]  don't want to apply any pesticides because I'm breeding and I don't want to
[14:43.930 --> 14:46.650]  ruin my plants that are going to get sprayed with pesticides.
[14:46.650 --> 14:48.010]  Then they can't receive pollen as well.
[14:48.210 --> 14:49.930]  And I don't want to ruin the seeds by spraying them.
[14:50.130 --> 14:53.410]  So I use predatory mites and I don't feel like they spread throughout my house.
[14:53.690 --> 14:56.690]  I feel like they stay on the plants and they eat the bugs that are there.
[14:56.690 --> 14:58.850]  And then when they get bored, they die and eat themselves.
[14:59.210 --> 15:00.050]  I have renewed hope.
[15:01.570 --> 15:04.930]  Yeah. In every grow that we've done, we've modified it in some way.
[15:04.970 --> 15:08.130]  Like you're saying next home growing in different pots. Um,
[15:08.170 --> 15:09.090]  I think that would be great.
[15:09.090 --> 15:12.510]  We got really excited talking about no till with some people here in Colorado
[15:12.510 --> 15:13.350]  Springs yesterday.
[15:13.350 --> 15:17.070]  And we were envisioning how we can make it work in our tent because at first we
[15:17.070 --> 15:19.990]  didn't think that was really possible, but the more that we've learned,
[15:19.990 --> 15:22.870]  it would almost be easier. Interesting. Okay.
[15:23.350 --> 15:26.190]  Then you don't have to replace soil. You don't have to make soil in your apartment.
[15:26.190 --> 15:29.350]  You don't have to dispose of soil. All that stuff that comes out,
[15:29.390 --> 15:33.150]  it goes back in basically. So it would be maybe,
[15:33.150 --> 15:35.270]  it may be more effective for you. Yeah. Maybe.
[15:35.630 --> 15:38.790]  I figured by the time we have it figured out, we'll have a larger space.
[15:39.110 --> 15:42.910]  There you go. That's a good goal. Living, living in Denver,
[15:42.910 --> 15:44.110]  it's expensive to get a house.
[15:44.110 --> 15:47.350]  So I'm kind of impressed that you're able to grow in the small apartment space
[15:47.350 --> 15:48.190]  you've gotten. Do you,
[15:48.310 --> 15:50.750]  do you worry about maybe your neighbors are growing also and you're going to get
[15:50.750 --> 15:52.750]  their bugs or anything? Um,
[15:53.230 --> 15:57.510]  they come and inspect our, our apartments on a pretty regular basis.
[15:57.510 --> 15:59.790]  I don't think there are many growers in our complex.
[15:59.830 --> 16:02.710]  Nobody that's got the, uh, the effort that you guys are going to make to do it.
[16:02.790 --> 16:07.110]  Yeah. That's awesome. But I know they are around. Yeah. Uh,
[16:07.130 --> 16:09.210]  there are more growers than we would assume. Yeah. Yeah.
[16:09.290 --> 16:12.810]  I remember when it came out that it was legal to grow and then you'd just start
[16:12.810 --> 16:16.130]  seeing people's ducting coming out of their back windows. Oh,
[16:16.130 --> 16:18.890]  you've been doing that. How long has that been there? Yeah.
[16:18.890 --> 16:21.410]  Now that it's changed a little bit, you see them going away. There's the,
[16:21.650 --> 16:23.570]  the wave when the hydro stores all got rich.
[16:23.610 --> 16:26.410]  Cause everybody thought I'm going to grow my six plants and they grew six and
[16:26.410 --> 16:29.090]  they got their extended plant count and they grew 20 and then they realized this
[16:29.090 --> 16:31.930]  is harder than it looks. And then you see all their shit on Craigslist.
[16:33.010 --> 16:33.450]  That's funny.
[16:33.450 --> 16:36.950]  We've driven around the city and like looking up in the big residential
[16:37.150 --> 16:39.390]  buildings, you can see different colors of light.
[16:39.470 --> 16:41.070]  And we know what some of the lights look like.
[16:41.430 --> 16:43.910]  And sometimes we're like, dude, you think they're growing up there?
[16:43.910 --> 16:45.310]  I bet they are. Look at that light.
[16:46.390 --> 16:47.870]  The always lovely, always beautiful.
[16:47.870 --> 16:51.790]  Miss Jenny Beth and I drove by a garage in Pueblo a few weeks ago and it's just
[16:51.790 --> 16:54.950]  lined with silver and you could tell they're in there hanging up the mylar.
[16:55.310 --> 16:57.750]  And I was like, dude, cover that window before you get to work.
[16:57.750 --> 17:00.790]  That's going to be a dope girl. I can see it. Literally a dope girl.
[17:00.810 --> 17:02.250]  It's going to be a nice girl in that garage,
[17:02.250 --> 17:05.130]  but I could see you're hanging mylar in there at 11 o'clock at night, dude.
[17:05.410 --> 17:07.450]  You might want to think twice about what you're doing.
[17:08.290 --> 17:10.770]  You're going to hang the mylar and then roll up the door and carry the lights in
[17:10.770 --> 17:13.890]  and hang them too. Like, yeah, be a little more careful you guys.
[17:13.970 --> 17:18.490]  Yeah. So it sounds like I have some organic homework to do and I need to take it
[17:18.490 --> 17:19.130]  to the next level.
[17:19.130 --> 17:22.730]  Yeah. Listen to the episode with Frosty and myself and then, uh, Hey Frosty,
[17:22.730 --> 17:25.090]  it's time to get you back on the podcast, bro. I know you listen.
[17:25.370 --> 17:28.330]  This is an official invitation. Let's get Frosty Organics back on the show.
[17:29.190 --> 17:31.270]  I'm going to turn this down. Something is buzzing in my headphones.
[17:31.310 --> 17:34.830]  It's not coming through on your guys's voices, but it is on mine. So, uh,
[17:34.830 --> 17:38.590]  everybody, I apologize if I'm buzzing in the recording, I will do my best to fix
[17:38.590 --> 17:42.030]  it. I'm pretty sure I know what I just did to fix it. Cool. We're good. All right.
[17:42.710 --> 17:43.910]  Um, you've got a lot of notes, my friend.
[17:43.910 --> 17:47.150]  I do not want to skip anything on your stealth grow. If you've got more,
[17:47.150 --> 17:49.990]  I would love to include it. Uh, if not,
[17:49.990 --> 17:54.070]  I know exactly where I am going to segue. I've got two options here. Uh,
[17:54.110 --> 17:56.310]  let's move on. All right, let's move on. Uh,
[17:56.310 --> 17:58.290]  your stealth grow and this hash,
[17:58.490 --> 18:02.970]  you grew some firefly and the hash you made or hash you had made.
[18:03.210 --> 18:05.310]  I'm stoned and that was delicious.
[18:05.530 --> 18:09.210]  And you keep teasing me that you have got firefly flowers here in the building.
[18:09.370 --> 18:12.450]  I do. So let's talk about this firefly.
[18:12.770 --> 18:15.290]  And then we can do this thing that is new to the podcast,
[18:15.290 --> 18:19.250]  where we kind of highlight a strain. Uh, it's new. People were asking for it.
[18:19.250 --> 18:20.490]  It felt a little, uh, honestly,
[18:20.490 --> 18:23.610]  it felt egotistical to come on here and be like, my name's Jeff. I bred this.
[18:23.930 --> 18:26.210]  Like it just feels like I'm boasting, but people seem to like it.
[18:26.210 --> 18:28.230]  So we can do the strain, uh, highlight,
[18:28.230 --> 18:30.630]  and we can look at the amazing flowers you've grown.
[18:30.630 --> 18:33.830]  And we can talk about your grow and the firefly all at the same time. Yeah.
[18:34.310 --> 18:36.510]  Uh, before we get started, I'll just say this, um,
[18:37.350 --> 18:40.990]  firefly was my first seat seed to grow. Oh, cool.
[18:40.990 --> 18:45.990]  And seeing the phenotypical variances was as a newer grower,
[18:47.430 --> 18:50.470]  I was very eyeopening for me. Excellent. Absolutely.
[18:50.510 --> 18:54.270]  Now just have this overflowing energy. I want to Fino hunt everything. You know,
[18:54.290 --> 18:57.690]  everywhere I go, I see seeds. I'm just, I got to get these seeds.
[18:59.010 --> 19:01.130]  A hundred of them. Oh, it does make harvesting different.
[19:01.130 --> 19:02.810]  You have to keep things separate and labeled.
[19:02.810 --> 19:04.770]  You got to try them and cure them and smoke them. And yeah,
[19:04.770 --> 19:07.970]  you started paying much more attention to detail. Great. Yeah.
[19:07.970 --> 19:09.090]  I'm glad I was able to do that.
[19:09.250 --> 19:13.850]  So it definitely is the next level and growing, uh, for me as a beginner.
[19:14.170 --> 19:18.810]  And it has provided like a renewed excitement. You know, not that I was ever,
[19:19.850 --> 19:22.650]  right. Yeah. Not that I was ever passionate since I met you.
[19:22.670 --> 19:25.030]  But yeah, not that I was ever plateauing, but yeah,
[19:25.030 --> 19:28.750]  it definitely accelerated my, my enthusiasm. Excellent.
[19:29.030 --> 19:30.150]  Do you want to start with the first?
[19:30.270 --> 19:33.270]  These are from the seeds I gave you at the dude grows cup. Is that correct?
[19:35.790 --> 19:37.910]  Well, we can rewind a little bit. We probably should have said this.
[19:37.910 --> 19:40.470]  I just pressed record and we started talking. Uh,
[19:40.830 --> 19:44.990]  you guys were listeners of my podcast and also Bo Nellis's podcast,
[19:44.990 --> 19:47.590]  the split, which is on a hiatus while Bo is working, uh,
[19:47.750 --> 19:50.150]  doing a bunch of other things. But Bo,
[19:50.410 --> 19:52.690]  we want you back girl. Shout out to Bo. We miss you Bo. Uh,
[19:52.690 --> 19:56.490]  we'd love to hear a few episodes. Come visit us. Hey everyone, Bo Nellis.
[19:56.510 --> 20:00.410]  It's time for the split podcast. Miss you Bo. Uh, come back,
[20:00.410 --> 20:03.770]  do some shows for us. Come do a show with us. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:03.930 --> 20:05.130]  But they were messaging me.
[20:05.150 --> 20:07.810]  We were talking on Instagram and they were saying, Hey, we listened to Bo.
[20:07.810 --> 20:10.930]  We listened to you. We'd love to meet up sometime. And I was like, sounds great.
[20:11.170 --> 20:13.930]  I'd love to make it happen. I am super busy. And then they're like,
[20:13.930 --> 20:15.410]  we're going to the dude grows cup. And I was like,
[20:15.410 --> 20:18.490]  I hope to see you guys there. And we were in line and you guys just walked right
[20:18.510 --> 20:20.470]  up and said hello, which is cool. Cause some people seem,
[20:20.830 --> 20:24.230]  I hear about it later. Like I saw you in line and I didn't say hi. And I'm like,
[20:24.230 --> 20:25.590]  well, that's a way to be my friend.
[20:26.310 --> 20:28.110]  You guys came right up and said what's up you guys.
[20:28.110 --> 20:30.950]  And another guy named Tony and his friend who was real quiet and his name,
[20:30.950 --> 20:32.350]  I already forgot cause he was so quiet.
[20:32.650 --> 20:35.050]  But I met you guys in line there and then I gave you some seeds.
[20:35.750 --> 20:39.110]  And so I gave you firefly and that was the first time we met in person.
[20:39.430 --> 20:42.470]  Hey, and I'll just say when Jeff says, come up and talk to him,
[20:42.710 --> 20:45.910]  he's not just saying that. I mean, he's serious. It was,
[20:46.210 --> 20:48.730]  I felt like I've known him for 10 years when I walked up to him.
[20:48.730 --> 20:52.730]  Well, thank you. People say I'm intimidating looking. I am six foot five.
[20:52.730 --> 20:54.850]  You guys, I'm six foot five and like 200 pounds.
[20:55.250 --> 20:59.770]  I've got dreadlocks that hang past my butt. Uh, my eyes are bright red and I'm,
[21:00.530 --> 21:04.450]  I'm not fat, but I'm not skinny. I'm in shape. I can handle myself. And if,
[21:04.770 --> 21:08.050]  if I need to be intimidating, I can't, but I'm not, I'm not trying to be,
[21:08.050 --> 21:09.330]  I got a beard and a mustache.
[21:09.650 --> 21:12.810]  I guess I look like I'm going to commit a crime or something,
[21:13.630 --> 21:15.070]  but I'm chilling.
[21:15.230 --> 21:17.670]  I want to smoke some dabs with you and hear about your grow and look at your
[21:17.670 --> 21:20.230]  pictures on your phone. Cause that's 90% of the time. That's what happens.
[21:20.230 --> 21:21.450]  People show up and like, look at the pictures.
[21:21.450 --> 21:24.390]  I grew and we start looking at each other's phones and talking about cannabis
[21:24.390 --> 21:27.910]  and yeah, we become friends. Uh, if you're cool, come talk to me.
[21:28.230 --> 21:29.710]  Like if you've got a problem, come talk to me.
[21:29.710 --> 21:32.510]  Maybe we'll take a dab and solve that too. I'm not trying to be intimidating.
[21:32.790 --> 21:35.030]  I'm a weed breeder. I'm a Rasta man. I'm, I'm chilling.
[21:35.390 --> 21:37.350]  We're going to have a good time. So yeah, don't be shy.
[21:37.950 --> 21:40.150]  You may end up on the podcast like these folks did.
[21:40.370 --> 21:42.090]  Yes. It was, it was exciting.
[21:42.090 --> 21:45.370]  So we were just going to go up and say hello to you and just sesh, you know,
[21:45.370 --> 21:46.210]  if we could.
[21:46.370 --> 21:49.970]  And we had been in the market for seeds because we had already grown several
[21:49.970 --> 21:54.810]  clones and had a couple of girls under our belt by then. And we, we, we,
[21:54.850 --> 21:57.370]  you were like, yeah, we really need to start growing from seeds.
[21:57.370 --> 22:00.970]  And we were thinking about that. And then we just met you that night.
[22:01.010 --> 22:05.010]  And it was serendipitous. It was perfect. Yeah. And then here we are.
[22:05.290 --> 22:08.090]  I was just standing in line with time to kill, making new friends.
[22:08.270 --> 22:10.110]  Yeah. We had no idea it would end up like that.
[22:10.150 --> 22:10.950]  It worked out beautifully.
[22:10.950 --> 22:14.950]  That's why I give seeds away because it's planting seeds starting relationships
[22:14.970 --> 22:16.070]  and building friendships that way.
[22:16.150 --> 22:18.990]  Yeah. And man has it expanded our knowledge.
[22:19.030 --> 22:22.790]  Good. Good. I can see it. I can actually see on your guys' feed,
[22:22.790 --> 22:24.750]  how excited you are about growing from the seeds.
[22:24.750 --> 22:26.990]  Cause there's more pictures of the stuff from seed than anything else.
[22:26.990 --> 22:28.710]  Yeah. Thank you for sure. Well, thank you guys.
[22:28.710 --> 22:30.750]  You have done me proud with the concentrate so far.
[22:31.070 --> 22:32.990]  So you're going to show me the first sample. It looks like,
[22:32.990 --> 22:34.550]  I'm going to tell everybody what firefly is.
[22:34.550 --> 22:36.590]  And we'll talk about that for just a second. And then we'll do that.
[22:36.590 --> 22:40.010]  Firefly is a lemon skunk female. Uh,
[22:40.030 --> 22:44.630]  the lemon skunk was from seed also it's a greenhouse seeds, lemon skunk.
[22:44.890 --> 22:49.610]  I've had that for years, probably since 2008, 2010.
[22:49.610 --> 22:52.010]  I've had that lemon skunk. I still have that lemon skunk.
[22:52.370 --> 22:55.310]  It is the same lemon skunk that I use to make lemon Jeffrey,
[22:55.770 --> 23:00.090]  but it was pollinated. Firefly was made with the lemon skunk and arise,
[23:00.130 --> 23:04.690]  the arise male known as Solomon, which is a golden goat as a female.
[23:04.870 --> 23:07.270]  And daybreaker is a male. So it's,
[23:07.310 --> 23:10.590]  that's a whole bunch of great lineups in there to make a whole bunch of great
[23:10.590 --> 23:12.010]  stuff, but it's got the lemon turps.
[23:12.310 --> 23:15.870]  I made it trying to make a big lemony flavored plant.
[23:15.870 --> 23:18.150]  I wanted to make kind of another lemon Jeffrey,
[23:18.150 --> 23:22.270]  but bigger was my goal and maybe more resin and more of a cush flavor instead of
[23:22.290 --> 23:24.430]  the lemon, maybe a lemon cush thing was kind of my goal.
[23:24.750 --> 23:28.950]  So you guys have the flowers. Uh, that's where it came from. What do you think?
[23:28.950 --> 23:31.750]  I, how close do you think I got to that lemony cush thing?
[23:31.790 --> 23:34.310]  Yeah. So what we brought with us today are, um,
[23:34.490 --> 23:38.810]  well we grew out five Finos. We, we brought three with us.
[23:39.170 --> 23:44.090]  This one definitely has a distinct lemon smell to it.
[23:44.170 --> 23:45.010]  Okay.
[23:46.970 --> 23:51.970]  The second one has such a strong lemon smell that I can't wait for you to smell
[23:54.010 --> 23:57.610]  it because I'm curious how this one, he's got a small jar. The second one,
[23:57.810 --> 24:00.930]  she just reached for a big ass jar. I can tell which one you like.
[24:00.970 --> 24:03.890]  These were different. Yeah. To be clear, these were different harvests.
[24:04.190 --> 24:05.510]  So this one has an extra, these,
[24:05.550 --> 24:08.090]  this one has an extra couple months of curing on it. All right.
[24:08.110 --> 24:11.270]  But I will say that the, the variances,
[24:11.630 --> 24:14.750]  the variants that you will, that you will smell between them are,
[24:15.670 --> 24:19.710]  they were there before the two months of curing. Okay. Um, so anyways, yeah,
[24:19.710 --> 24:24.070]  the second one, there's, it's so lemony that I labeled it that way.
[24:24.070 --> 24:27.350]  I wish I would have made concentrate. All right. So yeah,
[24:27.350 --> 24:29.910]  I can't wait for you to try that one. Then this third one,
[24:29.910 --> 24:33.870]  that's the one that I really want to talk about because we don't have as refined
[24:33.890 --> 24:38.270]  of a palette as many. We obviously, we know what lemon smells like,
[24:38.710 --> 24:42.070]  you know, or we know what orange smells like, but once we, and I,
[24:42.150 --> 24:45.390]  and I even know what diesel smells like, you know, like a sour diesel.
[24:45.550 --> 24:48.710]  But once we start getting into like different strains where you say, Oh,
[24:48.710 --> 24:52.910]  this is gassy or this is Kimmy, you know, this has a Kim smell. Right.
[24:52.950 --> 24:55.870]  That's where we, we both get a little bit lost. Okay.
[24:55.950 --> 24:58.230]  And this third one has one of those things.
[24:58.230 --> 25:01.510]  And so I can't wait for you to smell it and tell us what the hell we're
[25:01.530 --> 25:04.370]  smelling. All right. Yeah. We were talking, go ahead.
[25:04.570 --> 25:07.330]  Oh, I was just going to say really quickly is these two phenols,
[25:07.330 --> 25:09.290]  the ones that I have lemon and just non lemon.
[25:09.330 --> 25:12.090]  I didn't know whether to put that gassy those questions we were going to ask
[25:12.090 --> 25:16.170]  you is these have been curing for a little over 30 days.
[25:16.650 --> 25:19.810]  Yes. They have about, okay. I just want to, cause he told you how long this one,
[25:20.330 --> 25:22.290]  how old it is. I just wanted you to know this one,
[25:23.010 --> 25:24.730]  a little over 30 days for this one.
[25:24.810 --> 25:29.210]  Now you earlier we were talking about the smells, uh, Kim gas,
[25:29.210 --> 25:30.630]  diesel. Uh, and,
[25:30.630 --> 25:34.910]  and I tried to describe it a little bit in what I think of gas is obvious.
[25:34.970 --> 25:37.710]  Like I think gas, it smells like unleaded. You pull up to the gas station,
[25:37.710 --> 25:40.630]  you get that gas smell when it gets a sharper,
[25:40.990 --> 25:43.470]  maybe might be the word for it a little spicier.
[25:43.670 --> 25:47.150]  I think that's when it turns into like fuel or diesel that that's when,
[25:47.310 --> 25:49.430]  and that's just when the labels will change. And when,
[25:49.990 --> 25:53.230]  I guess I'm kind of turning into the wine guy, the wine descriptor guy,
[25:53.230 --> 25:54.950]  I can't say the word properly. I know what the word is.
[25:54.950 --> 25:57.190]  Where's Wade Ridley when you need him, he knows how to say that word for me.
[25:58.170 --> 26:03.050]  Yeah, really close. I just say it. I don't speak French, but, uh, yeah,
[26:03.050 --> 26:05.250]  I feel like I'm the wine or the weed version of that guy.
[26:05.490 --> 26:07.530]  So you go from the gassy to a little bit sharper.
[26:07.530 --> 26:09.050]  You start getting the fuel and the diesel.
[26:09.070 --> 26:13.210]  And then when you kind of tone it down and it gets muted, but earthy,
[26:13.210 --> 26:15.610]  maybe that's when I think it starts turning into Kim.
[26:15.610 --> 26:17.810]  And then when it gets swampy and chocolatey,
[26:17.810 --> 26:19.650]  that's kind of when I think it turns into OG.
[26:20.050 --> 26:24.290]  So that's that like diesel Kush chem OG wheel there.
[26:24.350 --> 26:28.190]  Okay. And then my head, that could be my own flavor palette in my head.
[26:28.390 --> 26:31.070]  So now he's going to bust one out and be like, which one is this?
[26:31.390 --> 26:35.870]  That's what I'm excited for. Let's start. Okay. Yes. Let's do number one.
[26:35.910 --> 26:38.870]  Yeah. And let's begin with the one that we harvested first.
[26:40.190 --> 26:43.950]  Oh, I can smell it. You're a foot away from me. I can smell that thing.
[26:45.070 --> 26:45.990]  Good trim job.
[26:49.270 --> 26:52.390]  Hey, I've listened to your trimming critique. Well, thank you. Uh, no,
[26:52.410 --> 26:53.450]  no, good trim. Great.
[26:55.210 --> 26:59.010]  There is a, I can smell both parents in here completely.
[26:59.330 --> 27:03.090]  The thing that smells like lemon sorbet or like a lemon, uh,
[27:03.130 --> 27:06.610]  like a soft ice cream that is definitely the lemon skunk.
[27:07.730 --> 27:11.930]  And then there's that, uh, it's got a,
[27:13.290 --> 27:17.290]  Oh, what is that? It's got a hint of coffee and cheese.
[27:17.610 --> 27:21.970]  And that is from the daybreaker, uh, parent in there,
[27:21.990 --> 27:25.870]  coming from a rise. That's Joseph OG putting a little cheese in there.
[27:26.110 --> 27:30.870]  That probably explains why that one smells less lemony than the next one.
[27:30.950 --> 27:35.070]  Right. It probably got more of, it actually got its grandfather in the jeans,
[27:35.190 --> 27:38.510]  which I only know that cause I know who its grandfather is. Joseph OG.
[27:38.710 --> 27:43.030]  I can smell the Joseph giving it cheese and the lemon skunk is giving it.
[27:43.590 --> 27:46.670]  It's like a creamy lemon cheese and that smells delicious.
[27:46.690 --> 27:50.990]  Although it doesn't sound like good things. It smells really good.
[27:51.990 --> 27:54.230]  Let's smell it again. After I said creamy lemon cheese.
[27:56.830 --> 27:59.550]  Oh yeah. I wouldn't have originally chosen cheese.
[27:59.550 --> 28:02.510]  Like a sharp cheddar with lemon meringue on top maybe.
[28:03.350 --> 28:06.750]  Which is that sounds like a disgusting description. You'd be like,
[28:06.750 --> 28:10.210]  take that off my plate, but I want to smoke it. Like I definitely,
[28:10.210 --> 28:13.270]  that smells really nice. Good work on that one. Yeah. Uh,
[28:13.310 --> 28:17.110]  so lemon cream and cheese is what I got from there.
[28:18.070 --> 28:21.110]  So this next vino that is being put in front of you,
[28:21.530 --> 28:26.370]  it's the one that had such a distinct lemon smell and it popped the lid here
[28:26.370 --> 28:30.530]  with the mic right by it. I was hoping you guys could smell it.
[28:30.570 --> 28:34.730]  Did you smell it one day? One day I can smell it. Oh,
[28:34.730 --> 28:37.050]  that is, that is like mostly lemon skunk.
[28:37.490 --> 28:41.530]  That is so much lemon skunk right there. Wow. Wow.
[28:44.050 --> 28:46.250]  I'm just sniffing at it. You guys, I apologize for the moment.
[28:46.830 --> 28:47.670]  Wow.
[28:50.110 --> 28:52.790]  So this one doesn't have as compact of a bud,
[28:53.830 --> 28:58.590]  but the trim job is great and the trichomes are stacking up
[28:59.150 --> 28:59.830]  and the smell.
[28:59.830 --> 29:03.590]  I thought there were far more trichomes on that one than the first female.
[29:03.630 --> 29:06.910]  Yeah. Oh yeah. And do you think maybe it's because there's more surface area?
[29:07.350 --> 29:10.030]  Am I, are we learning that? Is that starting to become a real thing?
[29:10.670 --> 29:12.110]  I'm wondering if my theory is accurate.
[29:13.390 --> 29:14.790]  I'm going to kind of just break it a little bit right here.
[29:17.070 --> 29:17.910]  Okay.
[29:18.310 --> 29:21.150]  This is like almost all lemon skunk.
[29:24.390 --> 29:28.270]  That sharp, uh, the tang at the end, that's golden goat coming through.
[29:28.510 --> 29:29.830]  Oh, very cool.
[29:31.470 --> 29:35.190]  The soft, the lemon skunk I use smells like a soft lemon ice cream.
[29:35.190 --> 29:39.710]  Like it's got a, um, like if you smelled the lemon head box,
[29:39.750 --> 29:42.150]  not the lemon heads themselves, but the box. Okay.
[29:42.190 --> 29:45.350]  And that's what gives it that smooth smell. And that tang at the end,
[29:45.370 --> 29:48.690]  like the orange where it goes. And this may be weird when you smell it,
[29:48.710 --> 29:51.850]  the smell is smooth. And the final part of the aroma, it spikes up.
[29:52.130 --> 29:55.050]  Like if I had to draw the smell on a graph and I know that's fucking really
[29:55.050 --> 29:57.770]  weird, but if I, it would go smell, smell, smell,
[29:57.770 --> 30:01.330]  wang and that wang at the end, that's the golden goat given a little twinge.
[30:03.530 --> 30:06.770]  I really liked that. You guys did a good job. There's something sour to it too.
[30:07.490 --> 30:09.610]  My fingers smell completely different than the bud smelled.
[30:09.850 --> 30:12.930]  I just had a moment thinking about how fucking cool this is.
[30:13.190 --> 30:17.070]  We're getting to smell different phenotypes of a strain that we grew from seed
[30:17.470 --> 30:19.230]  and get to talk about it with the breeder.
[30:19.950 --> 30:22.350]  Well, I wasn't trying to make it anything big like that, but now it's going to be,
[30:22.350 --> 30:25.230]  awesome. I appreciate you guys. Thank you. This is, this is really fun to me.
[30:25.870 --> 30:28.470]  The trichomes are huge on it and they're really pressed together.
[30:28.470 --> 30:31.270]  It's like a, the trichome heads grew so big.
[30:31.290 --> 30:35.190]  It had to spread the trichomes out that almost needed to scrug the trichomes.
[30:35.270 --> 30:38.470]  Yeah. Good work on that. Thank you. Thank you. All right.
[30:38.990 --> 30:41.270]  Now drum roll for the one that we can't figure out.
[30:41.970 --> 30:46.450]  Yes. The unknown phenotype. There you go. And before I open this one,
[30:46.450 --> 30:49.650]  if you had to keep one of these three, which one would you run again?
[30:50.650 --> 30:55.610]  No doubt. The, the lemon one that you just, but you know that a lot of that has
[30:55.610 --> 31:00.290]  to do with our preference. We do, we do favor these, these citrus aromas.
[31:00.290 --> 31:02.490]  Okay. And berries, the fruity mer.
[31:02.610 --> 31:04.810]  Well I can tell by the concentrate you gave me. Yeah.
[31:05.410 --> 31:09.410]  So fruity and delicious and yeah. Uh, yeah, that's probably so far of the two.
[31:09.430 --> 31:10.430]  That's the one I would grow.
[31:10.590 --> 31:13.830]  That's very similar to the phenotype that you see in a lot of the pictures of
[31:13.830 --> 31:16.510]  firefly that I post. It smelled just like that. Very cool.
[31:16.510 --> 31:17.990]  The concentrates I made were delicious.
[31:18.110 --> 31:20.710]  So what is your favorite phenotype of firefly?
[31:23.110 --> 31:26.470]  The one that I'm going to discover next when I grow it. Uh, no, I,
[31:26.870 --> 31:29.670]  it's very similar to that one. It's the one that, uh, and I,
[31:30.190 --> 31:32.810]  I give them weird names in my head, but the sharp one,
[31:33.310 --> 31:36.470]  the one that looked like the leaves were super serrated and curved up on the
[31:36.490 --> 31:38.050]  edge. Cause I've grown probably,
[31:39.130 --> 31:41.630]  probably a hundred seeds of that one in different batches.
[31:41.630 --> 31:43.810]  And I noticed that the lemony,
[31:43.850 --> 31:47.130]  the lemon skunk one gets these longer leaves that are super serrated on the
[31:47.130 --> 31:50.530]  edges. And she's always going to have that lemon candy smell real nice.
[31:50.930 --> 31:53.970]  So that one, the one with the serrated, the serrated and veg,
[31:54.010 --> 31:56.890]  the leaves will serrate and curve up just a little bit and veg.
[31:57.250 --> 31:58.650]  And that's how I can find it. Okay.
[31:58.850 --> 32:02.090]  I would definitely choose the lemony one too. Okay. And, um,
[32:02.310 --> 32:05.590]  I had forgotten how much I had liked, um,
[32:05.590 --> 32:09.510]  and hadn't had in so long lemon skunk and the skunkier.
[32:09.550 --> 32:12.670]  I posted a picture of lemon skunk yesterday and people went crazy.
[32:12.710 --> 32:14.470]  They're like, where do I get this old school lemon skunk?
[32:14.470 --> 32:17.390]  It was kind of nostalgic in a way, in a sense.
[32:17.430 --> 32:20.870]  I'd like to find some old school stuff before I open this one and smell it.
[32:20.910 --> 32:23.670]  You say it's got a funky smell, sort of a diesel or a chem.
[32:23.710 --> 32:25.350]  Did it have really big fan leaves?
[32:27.550 --> 32:30.270]  I have about average size. Okay. I would say. All right. Yeah.
[32:30.490 --> 32:32.370]  I wouldn't say between the two. One was, yeah.
[32:34.570 --> 32:38.130]  If you're growing firefly one way that you can find the one that leans more
[32:38.130 --> 32:42.130]  toward the, uh, the Joseph OG side of thing, it's going to have bigger leaves,
[32:42.330 --> 32:43.490]  the skinnier leaves on this one.
[32:43.490 --> 32:46.170]  You're going to get more lemon flavor because that golden goat and lemon skunk
[32:46.170 --> 32:48.090]  is going to come out. Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah.
[32:48.390 --> 32:49.930]  And then when Joseph starts kicking in there,
[32:49.930 --> 32:52.970]  when the daybreaker from Joseph and Kim start kicking in, the leaves get wider.
[32:53.010 --> 32:56.290]  You know, those are, and that's why I really like you doing these, um,
[32:56.390 --> 33:00.550]  these strain reviews because notes like those are notes that you don't
[33:00.550 --> 33:01.870]  necessarily get in grower.
[33:05.390 --> 33:06.350]  How'd you do cheese?
[33:07.510 --> 33:08.830]  He just smiled ear to ear.
[33:09.790 --> 33:13.870]  That's a lemon more than lemon cheese. I love it. And hated at the same time.
[33:13.870 --> 33:17.470]  I'm like, that's funky. Terrible. Give me more. Yeah.
[33:18.190 --> 33:20.910]  I'm glad that you, yeah, you're agreeing.
[33:22.830 --> 33:26.030]  So that's, that's Kim. Uh, that's the Kim. Okay.
[33:26.350 --> 33:30.470]  Joseph OG and Kim D and one of the, and the, the, uh, daybreaker that I used.
[33:30.470 --> 33:34.390]  And that's the Kim that's given, but it's altered by something,
[33:35.950 --> 33:38.950]  but that underlying the base of that is Kim D.
[33:40.350 --> 33:43.630]  But then that cheesy thing that's coming through, I don't, that's so weird.
[33:45.910 --> 33:47.830]  Maybe when the lemons and the camera mixing,
[33:50.950 --> 33:53.790]  I just keep sniffing at it. You guys, I apologize for this.
[33:54.010 --> 33:56.490]  It's amazing. The variance in the three of them,
[33:57.210 --> 34:02.210]  but you are definitely getting a cheese and a lemon meringue cheese kind of
[34:02.210 --> 34:03.970]  thing going on. That's very unique.
[34:06.010 --> 34:09.690]  What kind of nutrients did you use just out of curiosity? Uh, well, you know,
[34:09.690 --> 34:13.490]  the, the soil that we use is it's preloaded.
[34:13.490 --> 34:15.170]  So I just amend with, uh,
[34:15.210 --> 34:19.530]  I use recharge from a Scotty real over at the dude grow show.
[34:20.090 --> 34:22.770]  It's the first time recharge has ever been mentioned on my show. Yes.
[34:22.770 --> 34:26.310]  So I use that, you know, that gets your amino acids.
[34:27.590 --> 34:31.670]  It's pro microbial and I, you know, I'm, I'm not an expert in that area,
[34:32.190 --> 34:36.950]  but yeah, I mean it has, um, has molasses kelp. Uh, so yeah,
[34:36.990 --> 34:40.470]  I mean all of those things that we are told to you. So I just use it.
[34:40.990 --> 34:41.830]  And then I,
[34:41.830 --> 34:46.190]  I add just a little bit of bio bloom in the later weeks of flower,
[34:46.750 --> 34:50.630]  uh, just to give it that extra nutrient boost. Uh, you know,
[34:50.650 --> 34:55.090]  but as I moved to a larger container, I shouldn't have to amend anything.
[34:55.170 --> 34:59.370]  I just want to keep smelling that. So I know it's a handful.
[34:59.390 --> 35:01.650]  So your nutrients aren't making too much of a difference on the,
[35:01.650 --> 35:02.970]  that's the weed that smells like that.
[35:02.970 --> 35:05.850]  That's that plant that smells that way because it's flushed and it smells good.
[35:05.930 --> 35:07.410]  They are. Yeah. They're identical. I mean,
[35:07.450 --> 35:11.530]  all three of these were grown identically. Yeah. Same soil.
[35:11.530 --> 35:14.890]  The more lemon one I think has the bigger trichomes. Yeah.
[35:14.890 --> 35:19.670]  This one isn't as trichome, but that aroma, there's something very pungent.
[35:19.670 --> 35:24.330]  Yeah. It's pungent. How far down the block can you smell that when you smoke this
[35:24.330 --> 35:28.890]  one? Oh no, we haven't. We haven't.
[35:28.890 --> 35:31.170]  But the other one for sure you can walk in.
[35:31.410 --> 35:33.250]  We've been making an effort to, uh,
[35:34.370 --> 35:37.930]  keep these to the side until we, I didn't get this with them.
[35:37.930 --> 35:42.370]  And the cheese thing when I grew it, I did not get any of the cheese smell.
[35:42.610 --> 35:45.730]  So I'm going to grow more seeds and look for the cheese. You guys,
[35:45.730 --> 35:48.130]  if you're growing firefly out there and you notice cheese in the aroma,
[35:48.470 --> 35:50.910]  let me know. Because if you're getting it from more than one or two growers,
[35:50.910 --> 35:55.710]  I need to add that in my descriptions. Uh, lemon cream cheese
[35:56.670 --> 36:00.550]  and a foot. Yeah. So just a little bit of foot in there. I like it. I really do.
[36:00.630 --> 36:05.710]  Yeah. Just Jeff saying that tells us that that phenotype is not
[36:05.990 --> 36:11.230]  very common. Yeah. That's so having that, that one as a new grower,
[36:11.430 --> 36:15.950]  that was in it when it really solidified that idea that strain names
[36:16.410 --> 36:20.810]  don't mean much to me. You know, it was like, Whoa, these are all firefly.
[36:21.250 --> 36:25.210]  And when you put the, when you put two next to each other that are,
[36:25.530 --> 36:27.470]  that are on opposite ends of the spectrum,
[36:27.970 --> 36:31.570]  you can really see those phenotypical expressions. Absolutely.
[36:32.130 --> 36:36.490]  I wish we as a, as an entire cannabis, um,
[36:36.530 --> 36:37.570]  community I wish,
[36:37.650 --> 36:41.930]  I wish we could get down more to the Fino level when we are labeling things,
[36:41.930 --> 36:45.810]  you know, dispensaries. I wish. And even from a medicinal perspective,
[36:45.850 --> 36:49.630]  it's very important that I agree with that to identify things.
[36:49.630 --> 36:53.870]  And so just saying a strain name, that's, that's,
[36:54.150 --> 36:57.670]  but you almost have to grow from seed to, to fully understand that.
[36:58.030 --> 37:01.710]  So guaranteed. Uh, there, and there are only a few,
[37:01.710 --> 37:03.910]  and then you're going to have arguments. People are going to be like, no,
[37:03.910 --> 37:06.390]  I've got the, this phenotype, but I've got the, this Fino,
[37:06.570 --> 37:10.870]  because there's so much a pissing contest basically in this industry and so much
[37:10.890 --> 37:12.750]  ego that people are just going to, they're all going to claim.
[37:12.750 --> 37:16.330]  They have that Fino I've all got, we've all got the forum cookies cut. No,
[37:16.330 --> 37:18.810]  I've got the whatever cut. I've got the platinum cut.
[37:18.850 --> 37:21.330]  And it just turns into a Dick's thing and contest at that point.
[37:21.730 --> 37:25.970]  It's just all about egos, unfortunately. Yeah. But I agree. I like that people,
[37:26.570 --> 37:29.970]  uh, they list candy store and orange Fino when they're selling Jilly bean.
[37:29.970 --> 37:32.530]  If they know what they're talking about. I think that should be a thing.
[37:32.610 --> 37:35.890]  I definitely do. Also something that people don't, uh,
[37:36.270 --> 37:40.690]  realize and pay respect to is when you go to the dispensary and you're buying
[37:40.990 --> 37:43.670]  whatever you're going to get there, we'll say you're going to go get Ecto cooler.
[37:44.290 --> 37:48.990]  Somebody already did the Fino hunt for you and found the best Ecto cooler or it
[37:48.990 --> 37:51.550]  would not have made it to the commercial grow. Like that's,
[37:51.590 --> 37:54.150]  that's the good one right there. So yeah,
[37:54.150 --> 37:57.630]  they have already done that Fino hunt and they've gone through so many of those.
[37:58.070 --> 38:01.030]  I think that's something that people forget about. Right.
[38:03.150 --> 38:05.430]  Oh, she's showing me some test results. Oh,
[38:05.430 --> 38:09.430]  that's a much better screenshot than what I had before. Does that say 29?
[38:10.370 --> 38:10.730]  Actually,
[38:10.730 --> 38:14.490]  this will be a good education for the viewers because I sure are listeners
[38:14.510 --> 38:18.650]  because I sure did not understand this. How do you read those results? I mean,
[38:18.650 --> 38:22.650]  I understand the difference between T H C a and T H C,
[38:23.170 --> 38:27.170]  but the way that it listed out there, you can explain to the listeners.
[38:27.730 --> 38:29.850]  This is the one labeled lemon, the one that we're referring to at the moment.
[38:29.850 --> 38:32.850]  Okay. That is the keeper right there. That's the keeper Fino type.
[38:32.850 --> 38:34.770]  That's the one that you should have around. Did you take clones?
[38:35.770 --> 38:39.030]  No, we're just learning to clone ourselves right now.
[38:39.310 --> 38:41.910]  You're lucky because I brought a big old box of seeds with me because I had a
[38:41.910 --> 38:45.150]  feeling that you might need more. That's our next project. Cool. Each grown.
[38:45.230 --> 38:48.590]  We're building it. So cloning is our next, our next level. That's easy.
[38:48.630 --> 38:51.070]  Do you have space? You just need one line, a little bit of space. Yeah.
[38:51.070 --> 38:54.870]  We have that veg armoire. Okay. Yeah. Okay. We'll, we'll teach you this.
[38:54.990 --> 38:56.150]  Yeah. We're figuring some things out.
[38:56.230 --> 39:01.230]  It says you have 29.8% THC a and 3% Delta nine T H C a.
[39:01.450 --> 39:06.450]  THC a is the acid a Delta nine THC is once it has been converted and I'm doing
[39:07.530 --> 39:10.170]  this without notes. So I hope I am correct. Then it showed a,
[39:10.210 --> 39:15.210]  it shows you total potential a Delta nine THC would be 29.1%.
[39:16.930 --> 39:21.810]  Well, how did they get that math for the total THC of 32.8%?
[39:22.130 --> 39:27.130]  There is a mathematical equation that I found online that I think was written by
[39:28.110 --> 39:33.110]  organtica in New Mexico and they break it down exactly how to do that math.
[39:33.270 --> 39:35.230]  Unfortunately I didn't research it cause I didn't know you're going to throw
[39:35.230 --> 39:37.230]  that at me, but there is a math equation.
[39:37.230 --> 39:41.550]  You add them and then divide a certain part of it to find the average or
[39:41.550 --> 39:43.870]  something like that. But they're showing you the total potential.
[39:44.390 --> 39:49.390]  They're saying there is the potential of 32.8% total cannabinoids in there.
[39:50.830 --> 39:52.910]  And there's,
[39:53.890 --> 39:57.930]  I don't remember the exact difference between THC and THC a without my notes.
[39:57.930 --> 39:59.530]  One, that's when it breaks down,
[39:59.570 --> 40:01.810]  heat breaks it down and it makes it a different,
[40:01.810 --> 40:04.530]  it turns it into the acid, the more psychoactive part.
[40:05.010 --> 40:08.150]  I wish I had done research on that cause I feel like I haven't explained it
[40:08.150 --> 40:11.050]  properly. Yeah. But, but just ballpark, if someone,
[40:11.090 --> 40:14.270]  if someone was to ask you based on those results,
[40:14.270 --> 40:19.170]  what is the THC level of those test results? Just at a lame,
[40:19.190 --> 40:20.890]  in layman's terms, what would you answer?
[40:20.910 --> 40:25.350]  I would say this test about 30%. Okay. Yeah. Nice. Yeah.
[40:25.350 --> 40:27.030]  Well they get 29 and 32.
[40:27.510 --> 40:29.990]  That's showing me that those are your potentials and it's,
[40:29.990 --> 40:34.190]  it found 29.8 in there. So I would say 29. I would just say that number.
[40:34.190 --> 40:38.830]  I'd say 29.8% THC a and that sounds good. And that's accurate.
[40:38.830 --> 40:42.950]  Then you're not inflating anything or exaggerating. Yeah.
[40:43.190 --> 40:48.190]  And I'm going to write myself a note to clarify lab testing as another episode
[40:48.410 --> 40:52.050]  as another episode. Cause that's a, I wrote lab episode, but there we go.
[40:52.410 --> 40:56.050]  I'm talking and writing at the same time. Yeah. No, as more people,
[40:56.090 --> 40:58.610]  lab testing is very unclear, honestly, to tell you the truth,
[40:58.610 --> 41:02.170]  things like that. And also we're allowed to have a 15% variance either way.
[41:02.290 --> 41:07.210]  So this could have 45% THC or 15% THC to tell you the honest truth.
[41:07.290 --> 41:09.450]  Would you like to see the results of the other one? I would love to.
[41:10.330 --> 41:14.650]  It's the one that we had labeled gas. All right. Which, uh, which is really,
[41:14.770 --> 41:17.890]  cheese, I would say cheese, which there's no cheese in the genetics,
[41:17.910 --> 41:21.470]  but cheese is a skunk number one phenotype, which who knows what that really is.
[41:22.870 --> 41:24.350]  That's still great test results. Uh,
[41:24.370 --> 41:28.590]  26.8% and 2.3 on the Delta nine.
[41:28.990 --> 41:33.990]  And then it says total potential Delta nine THC 25.8 and then total THC 29.1.
[41:36.230 --> 41:37.590]  Let's see if you ran a dispensary,
[41:37.710 --> 41:40.550]  you would be the people that wrote 29.1 on the jar. That's just cause what,
[41:40.570 --> 41:44.350]  that's what a dispensary would do. Yeah. But as, as honest people,
[41:44.350 --> 41:47.150]  you'd probably explain to your friends that tested these two numbers.
[41:47.170 --> 41:51.570]  Yeah. I was very happy with those numbers. I think that speaks to your breeding.
[41:51.850 --> 41:52.670]  And I,
[41:53.450 --> 41:58.370]  I say that because I know there are things in my environment that I can improve.
[41:58.650 --> 42:02.010]  Like there are two or three things in my mind that I know I'm going to do.
[42:02.010 --> 42:06.410]  Do you want to share what those ideas are? CO2 is the first one. Okay. All right.
[42:06.410 --> 42:09.970]  And, um, and actually, actually in your opinion, adding CO2,
[42:09.970 --> 42:12.690]  I know it adds to your yield.
[42:13.670 --> 42:16.750]  Do you think it can have an impact on THC levels?
[42:18.270 --> 42:20.870]  Like I was talking about earlier, more surface area, more trichomes.
[42:20.990 --> 42:23.670]  So if you have more space, you can have more trichomes. I would think so.
[42:23.710 --> 42:27.030]  I would hope so. Yeah. I have a, I have a friend from Texas who would argue that,
[42:27.070 --> 42:29.910]  but I think you're going to get more trichomes per surface area.
[42:29.910 --> 42:33.230]  That's my biggest weakness right now. I feel like I need to add some CO2.
[42:33.310 --> 42:37.830]  All right. Is that legal where you are? Um, some places CO2 argument.
[42:37.830 --> 42:40.270]  Yeah. I mean, I wouldn't want to bring a tank in there. I would,
[42:40.330 --> 42:45.690]  I would use one of the lesser, um, lesser effective options, but you know,
[42:46.170 --> 42:49.690]  every little bit helps. Yep. You have to be safe and still. Yeah. Oh,
[42:49.890 --> 42:52.810]  actually you brought up safety. I want to talk about that real quick. Um, you know,
[42:52.810 --> 42:56.570]  living in a multi-unit complex, uh, in an apartment complex,
[42:56.970 --> 43:00.890]  it was never using HPS for,
[43:01.010 --> 43:05.730]  for the beginner growers out there. HPS puts a huge amount of heat,
[43:06.390 --> 43:10.510]  puts off a huge amount of heat. My led light at any point in time,
[43:10.510 --> 43:14.470]  I can go up and put my hand on it and keep my hand on it. Wow. So when,
[43:14.510 --> 43:19.710]  when I was trying to figure out how I, uh, when I was designing my grow,
[43:19.950 --> 43:24.910]  it was never an option for me to run HPS because if that light falls
[43:24.990 --> 43:29.750]  and it burns the house, it's not just me. It's not just me and my family.
[43:29.750 --> 43:34.870]  It's everybody. So, you know, it's, so I think whenever you are in a
[43:34.890 --> 43:36.210]  multi-unit complex,
[43:36.210 --> 43:40.170]  your decision on your lighting becomes a little more complicated for sure.
[43:40.210 --> 43:42.210]  Or that's, that's the way I was thinking.
[43:42.210 --> 43:45.770]  Unfortunately not everybody thinks that way, but they should. So, and you know,
[43:45.770 --> 43:50.210]  and that would also help, you know, in regards to regulation, um,
[43:50.230 --> 43:53.570]  there needs to be some education out there that just because you,
[43:54.010 --> 43:58.890]  just because you grow there, you don't necessarily have a fire hazard. Um,
[43:59.490 --> 44:02.650]  there definitely needs to be some education with our politicians and,
[44:03.070 --> 44:05.990]  but that's going to be the next step in the, in some counties,
[44:06.030 --> 44:09.350]  they're actually making home inspections. If you plan to grow at all,
[44:09.350 --> 44:11.630]  you must pass a home inspection. You must be up to code.
[44:11.630 --> 44:14.390]  You have to pass an electrical inspection. You have to show them your grow.
[44:14.670 --> 44:16.670]  And they have to be able to come inspect it whenever they want.
[44:16.670 --> 44:19.870]  So that's coming in the future. That will be statewide. Eventually.
[44:19.870 --> 44:21.550]  I could definitely see some of, uh,
[44:21.550 --> 44:25.510]  I could definitely see some of those jurisdictions requiring led. Yeah.
[44:25.590 --> 44:27.750]  You know, why not? Because we're pulling a lot of power.
[44:28.110 --> 44:31.270]  And if you don't have some sort of upgrade and you just try to plug in 4,000
[44:31.370 --> 44:34.890]  watt lights in a home, you're going to catch something on fire. It can happen.
[44:35.290 --> 44:36.690]  All right. Uh, let's loop back.
[44:36.730 --> 44:40.570]  We were talking about the genetics and how you think just improving your grow
[44:40.570 --> 44:43.730]  would make it a little bit better. And I think you did a great job. Uh,
[44:44.170 --> 44:46.330]  a little bit of improvement may bring you up a percentage or two,
[44:46.330 --> 44:48.090]  but I think you did a great job for what you've got.
[44:48.570 --> 44:49.970]  And those are impressive lab tests.
[44:49.990 --> 44:54.010]  Anything over like 22 or 24% is a great lab test. Honestly,
[44:54.010 --> 44:56.970]  when you start hitting the 28th and 29th, you can start doing cartwheels.
[44:56.990 --> 45:00.810]  Those are great. Yeah. The highest I've ever seen is 35. And that was a rise.
[45:01.290 --> 45:05.370]  And it was grown by our friends at Organica in New Mexico and tested at steep
[45:05.370 --> 45:09.170]  hill. Yeah. Yeah. So that's as high as you're going to see so far. Great.
[45:09.330 --> 45:13.330]  Yeah. It exceeded our expectations. I think you did a really good job. Nice.
[45:13.410 --> 45:15.930]  Yeah. I could tell. We contacted you like immediately.
[45:16.570 --> 45:18.970]  When I got those screenshots, I was like, Oh, I can kind of read those.
[45:19.250 --> 45:20.090]  I can kind of read them.
[45:20.090 --> 45:20.710]  You know, it was funny.
[45:20.710 --> 45:24.930]  We saw you on live that night and you were, you threw out there,
[45:25.330 --> 45:29.530]  um, or you, you ask everyone to give you test results. If they had them,
[45:29.670 --> 45:33.470]  we had already talked about that. That is cool. Yeah. That is cool.
[45:36.110 --> 45:38.110]  Well, you can say this cannabis is really good,
[45:38.110 --> 45:41.430]  but if you can put on your website tested at 29%, you know,
[45:41.430 --> 45:42.590]  that just looks really good for you.
[45:42.590 --> 45:46.270]  And then to have the test results from people with from reputable labs and I can
[45:46.270 --> 45:47.950]  show them screenshots of the test results.
[45:48.230 --> 45:50.910]  It definitely makes make some reputation and some credit.
[45:51.150 --> 45:55.070]  My next step is to get terpene testing. Oh, that would be fun. Oh yeah.
[45:55.110 --> 45:58.270]  That'd be a lot of fun. How much is the terpene test cost? Just out of curiosity.
[45:58.290 --> 46:02.050]  I wish I knew. Yeah, me too. Well, testing's becoming more, um,
[46:02.090 --> 46:06.330]  grower friendly, right? Um, because a lot of testing facilities,
[46:06.450 --> 46:10.450]  you have to, you have to be MED, right? You have to be MED.
[46:10.450 --> 46:15.370]  And we went to a grow symposium last year and Jeremy won a drawing to have
[46:15.370 --> 46:18.430]  every, all of our stuff tested and then we couldn't do it. Oh,
[46:18.430 --> 46:19.370]  because you're not MED regulated.
[46:19.370 --> 46:22.570]  Yeah. But we just saw that girl of that company and she said,
[46:22.570 --> 46:24.730]  they're changing that this year within their company.
[46:25.270 --> 46:29.550]  And as time passes, there are more options for home growers. Um,
[46:29.830 --> 46:34.230]  and right. So ways to have things done. Yeah. All right.
[46:34.230 --> 46:36.310]  So we talked about Firefly. Uh,
[46:36.310 --> 46:39.910]  let's talk more about Firefly because I'm still doing this.
[46:39.910 --> 46:42.470]  I've almost abandoned this whole strain list thing.
[46:42.630 --> 46:45.790]  The strain review thing we're doing. How long did you let them flower?
[46:48.110 --> 46:52.870]  60, no, 63 days. Perfect.
[46:53.010 --> 46:55.690]  Nine weeks. That's what I would have recommended. I think they're done.
[46:55.730 --> 46:59.250]  I think you did it just right on 63 days. So you guys, if you're doing Firefly,
[46:59.530 --> 47:01.410]  63 days is the hot ticket right there.
[47:01.410 --> 47:03.810]  Those two, the gas and the lemony one,
[47:03.810 --> 47:08.090]  those were harvested on like December 18th. Oh wow. So they've been curing up.
[47:08.890 --> 47:12.170]  All right. You telling her to talk on the mic? Just right on it.
[47:12.530 --> 47:16.490]  She's just, just barely laughing because we're still calling it the gassy.
[47:16.530 --> 47:20.370]  Oh yeah. We just said, we decided it was cheese. It's the cheesy gassy.
[47:20.430 --> 47:23.630]  Yeah. Yeah. Do you smell the cheese in there? And you smell that?
[47:23.630 --> 47:25.310]  I do. I need to change the label.
[47:25.630 --> 47:28.590]  Right? Yeah. A little Tillamook cow on there. All right.
[47:29.750 --> 47:31.430]  Was there anything that you noticed,
[47:31.430 --> 47:35.390]  any random details that you'd like to mention about the grow? Was one wonky?
[47:35.390 --> 47:37.950]  Was there a mutant in there? Did one grow 22 leaves?
[47:38.270 --> 47:42.190]  Notice that I got a little bit more yellowing of the leaves that I never could
[47:42.630 --> 47:45.030]  completely get, wrap my hands around,
[47:45.030 --> 47:49.230]  but the buds look so great that I never lost sleep about it. Okay. Um,
[47:49.450 --> 47:53.730]  and I'm, you know, at first I thought maybe it needed more nitrogen.
[47:53.730 --> 47:58.570]  I was over watering. I, I knew that my runoff pH was dialed in,
[47:58.570 --> 48:00.810]  so there weren't any nutrient locks. All right.
[48:00.890 --> 48:03.890]  I think she probably wanted more nitrogen. She likes to eat more nitrogen.
[48:03.890 --> 48:07.850]  She's hungry. Yeah. Okay. And I will say on that second grow, um,
[48:07.930 --> 48:11.570]  or the second cycle, I put more earthworm castings towards,
[48:11.930 --> 48:14.530]  okay. Towards the end. That speed her up a little, help her out.
[48:14.650 --> 48:18.690]  And I think that helped slow the, uh, the fading of the leaves down. So that would,
[48:18.790 --> 48:21.750]  that would explain the nitrogen deficiency. Yeah.
[48:22.030 --> 48:25.350]  Anything pollinated by a rise is going to grow fast and probably want more
[48:25.350 --> 48:26.750]  nutrients. Yeah. Yeah.
[48:26.750 --> 48:29.430]  So I would say be aggressive on the nitrogen because I was,
[48:29.710 --> 48:34.030]  I felt like I was pretty aggressive and she could have used more maybe.
[48:34.030 --> 48:36.350]  All right. So we'll feed her aggressively then.
[48:36.750 --> 48:40.990]  I was pretty much on all of them. Right. That we saw that it was like pretty equal
[48:41.070 --> 48:42.630]  for the most part. I mean, some,
[48:42.670 --> 48:47.150]  some phenos had maybe a little bit more yelling like a few days before,
[48:47.170 --> 48:49.490]  but the other one. Yeah. All right. Yeah.
[48:51.050 --> 48:52.410]  Have you smoked any of them yet?
[48:53.410 --> 48:56.490]  Well, that first one that we, we saved that big nug for you.
[48:56.530 --> 48:57.370]  That's all we have.
[48:59.410 --> 49:02.130]  It was all of our friends. Very favorite. Oh,
[49:02.130 --> 49:05.930]  I wanted to bring out something to you about this. So it was very interesting.
[49:06.010 --> 49:10.370]  Um, as, as we've gone through these grows, you know, this,
[49:10.370 --> 49:13.530]  the sense and the aroma change from like the very,
[49:13.530 --> 49:15.410]  in the beginning and the flower until the end,
[49:15.710 --> 49:19.190]  until the harvest while you're drying, then you cure in two weeks,
[49:19.190 --> 49:21.390]  it can change, you know, aromas. I feel like three times.
[49:21.870 --> 49:25.670]  So I will be honest with you. I was not a fan of the first firefly.
[49:25.970 --> 49:30.910]  I was like, this is not fruity or citrusy enough. This is earthy, you know?
[49:31.110 --> 49:34.070]  And then all of our friends would come over and that's the first one everyone
[49:34.070 --> 49:35.390]  would want to, that shows.
[49:35.430 --> 49:40.230]  But it wasn't until after it cured that I opened it one day, you know,
[49:40.230 --> 49:43.830]  cause you burped them throughout and I opened it one day and, uh,
[49:43.850 --> 49:47.290]  Jeremy and I were both like, Whoa. And I was like, game changer right then.
[49:47.330 --> 49:49.530]  After it cured, it was amazing.
[49:49.770 --> 49:54.450]  But I was not a fan up until up until that moment for that particular one.
[49:54.650 --> 49:56.130]  When you look at the two phenotypes,
[49:56.130 --> 49:58.530]  that was the big difference is the lemon came on,
[49:58.570 --> 50:02.770]  the lemon smell came on during the cure.
[50:02.890 --> 50:05.690]  All right. In the later phases of the cure.
[50:05.690 --> 50:06.730]  Suck some of that chlorophyll smell out.
[50:06.730 --> 50:10.810]  Whereas the other one I smelled when I unzipped the tent.
[50:11.750 --> 50:15.630]  Yeah. So, you know, I had to check myself and quit being so prejudgmental.
[50:15.750 --> 50:19.110]  There you go. Cure it and then smoke it. Exactly. It's usually the opposite.
[50:19.110 --> 50:21.910]  I usually find I love the smell. I love the smell. I dry it and cure it.
[50:21.910 --> 50:23.390]  And I go, Oh, where did that smell?
[50:24.070 --> 50:28.230]  So I'm glad that you brought out the good smell. Definitely an improvement.
[50:28.310 --> 50:32.110]  Yeah. So you've, uh, have you smoked the other two?
[50:32.790 --> 50:34.830]  Or you only smoked the one? No, we haven't. Yeah.
[50:34.950 --> 50:39.270]  What kind of buzz did the one that you did smoke give you? Were you like lazy?
[50:39.290 --> 50:41.810]  Were you energetic? Oh, it was absolutely a sativa high.
[50:41.890 --> 50:45.250]  Okay. Absolutely. A sativa high. In fact, of our entire stash at the moment,
[50:45.290 --> 50:49.730]  I, anytime I was going for a strong sativa, that was my go-to. Excellent.
[50:49.770 --> 50:53.250]  Didn't even have to put thought into it. Nice. All right. Get you creative.
[50:53.250 --> 50:56.330]  Get you moving. Get the dishes done. Forget where you left your keys.
[50:58.690 --> 50:59.690]  I'm going to, um,
[50:59.730 --> 51:03.290]  step away for a sec and I'm going to grab one of those bongs off the shelf and
[51:03.290 --> 51:07.290]  I'm going to prepare it. That sounds perfect. And then, yeah, let's session.
[51:07.390 --> 51:10.950]  So just one moment. Are we allowed to smoke in here?
[51:11.230 --> 51:14.510]  Well, we've been taking dabs. So, okay. I just know.
[51:15.030 --> 51:17.590]  Well, I just know that some places consider dabbing vaping.
[51:17.630 --> 51:20.270]  So I didn't know if there was a distinction to be made.
[51:20.390 --> 51:22.830]  Honestly, not part. I don't know if this is part of the business.
[51:22.830 --> 51:27.270]  Cause we're upstairs. There's another door. Yeah. Okay.
[51:27.470 --> 51:29.550]  There's a, if there's a bong, I bet you can smoke out of it.
[51:30.510 --> 51:32.190]  Yeah. I wouldn't have a bong if you can't smoke out of it.
[51:32.270 --> 51:34.630]  Hey, this facility, I just want to say real quick, guys,
[51:34.650 --> 51:38.850]  Cheryl and I came in town yesterday. We didn't know anybody.
[51:40.010 --> 51:44.970]  Um, and we just chose one of the only two social smoking clubs here in town.
[51:45.690 --> 51:46.530]  Walked in.
[51:46.570 --> 51:50.970]  Not many people here started talking to the girl behind the bar that was making
[51:50.990 --> 51:53.930]  us coffee and come find out she was the owner.
[51:54.930 --> 51:59.450]  Just the coolest, coolest girl in the world. Very,
[51:59.530 --> 52:01.850]  she was very welcoming to us.
[52:02.230 --> 52:05.390]  And within an hour of talking to her,
[52:05.390 --> 52:08.950]  I got permission to do this show up here in the upstairs area.
[52:09.430 --> 52:11.990]  And so I just want to say thank you again. It was just,
[52:12.070 --> 52:13.550]  she didn't know us from anybody.
[52:13.550 --> 52:18.150]  We just walked in off the street and she offered the space to us without knowing
[52:18.150 --> 52:20.470]  anything. So that's pretty kind of them. Yeah, it was very nice.
[52:20.510 --> 52:21.950]  And just to give them an official shout out,
[52:21.950 --> 52:25.750]  we are at the original cannabis club studio, a 64 in Colorado Springs.
[52:25.750 --> 52:28.830]  They are located at three, three, two East Colorado Avenue.
[52:28.850 --> 52:31.930]  It's at Colorado and Wasatch. Uh, there's plenty of parking.
[52:31.930 --> 52:34.770]  It's easy to get to. Uh, they check your ID at the door.
[52:34.770 --> 52:38.130]  They're super friendly, super polite. Get the crepes.
[52:39.330 --> 52:42.250]  Yeah. Jeremy just nodded like, yeah, bro, get the crepes. Uh,
[52:42.410 --> 52:44.050]  miss Jenny Beth had her birthday party here.
[52:44.050 --> 52:48.290]  We had a little smoke out and the crepes dude, the crepes were amazing.
[52:48.410 --> 52:51.410]  All the stoners enjoyed the crepes. I only ate a little bit and I wanted more.
[52:51.450 --> 52:52.290]  It was delicious.
[52:52.490 --> 52:55.810]  And we had a smoothie yet. We had a smoothie yesterday and of course it's made
[52:55.830 --> 53:00.150]  with real fruit and yeah, it was very hearty. Yeah. The, the crepes.
[53:00.230 --> 53:02.590]  I'm not, I might have to go downstairs in a minute and get some crepes.
[53:02.590 --> 53:05.350]  We want to, we're done with this. Well, she took off.
[53:05.390 --> 53:08.590]  She just vanished into the other end of the nether regions. She's gone now.
[53:08.870 --> 53:11.990]  We'll never see her again. She may have gotten permission for us to smoke. Nice.
[53:12.030 --> 53:15.230]  I hope that's where she's going. So do you want to move forward from the, uh,
[53:15.230 --> 53:19.430]  the strain? Uh, let's see 63 days to grow it. Uh, you guys,
[53:19.510 --> 53:22.550]  if you're growing firefly, it may get kind of tall on you.
[53:22.550 --> 53:25.510]  It's going to stretch because it is a sativa. The lemon skunk is stretchy.
[53:26.030 --> 53:29.750]  Uh, Solomon was a stretchy dude. So you're going to get some tall stuff,
[53:29.910 --> 53:34.630]  be ready for some bamboo stakes or some tomato cages or scrog that bitch out.
[53:34.630 --> 53:38.350]  She loves being spread out real far. Topper spread her out.
[53:38.390 --> 53:41.770]  She will really like that yield expectations. You're going to get good,
[53:41.770 --> 53:45.710]  happy yields, a firefly. She does put out, uh,
[53:45.730 --> 53:48.350]  we talked about feed tips, feed her heavily. Uh,
[53:48.370 --> 53:51.310]  she needs a little more nutrients than usual because she gets so big.
[53:51.470 --> 53:55.510]  She likes to grow fast. She'll take off on you. Give her a lot of nutrients. Uh,
[53:55.510 --> 53:59.650]  pH about six, four, just like everything else. Phenotypes to expect.
[53:59.650 --> 54:03.170]  There's one with the serrated leaves. Uh, the leaf tips will turn up.
[54:03.250 --> 54:06.450]  That's going to be super lemony flavored. The bigger leaves,
[54:06.450 --> 54:09.370]  the more toward daybreaker you're going to get the skinnier leaves,
[54:09.430 --> 54:12.610]  the more toward golden goat and lemon skunk. You're going to get a,
[54:12.610 --> 54:15.090]  I like the skinnier leaf phenotypes, but they get taller,
[54:15.130 --> 54:19.370]  they get skinnier and they grow faster. But, uh, that's where it's at for me.
[54:19.370 --> 54:21.310]  It's where the THC comes in. Uh,
[54:21.330 --> 54:23.530]  they are available at the hell a dank seed bank.
[54:23.530 --> 54:27.350]  So make sure you check them out at dank seed dot a store.
[54:27.470 --> 54:29.870]  I think that's what it is. Yeah. I'll correct that if I'm wrong.
[54:29.890 --> 54:31.870]  Dank seed dot store. Check them out the hell a dank seed bank.
[54:31.870 --> 54:33.030]  Let them know Rasta Jeff sent you.
[54:34.190 --> 54:39.070]  And I do think that's going to wrap up the little strain review for firefly.
[54:39.070 --> 54:41.470]  You guys, thank you for growing the shit out of it. It smells good.
[54:41.470 --> 54:44.270]  She's got a bong with fresh, clean water. This is going to be fun.
[54:44.310 --> 54:45.590]  Thank you for giving it to us. Oh yeah.
[54:45.590 --> 54:48.070]  You'll leave with some more stuff so that we can do this again in the future.
[54:48.230 --> 54:50.990]  Let's do it. I think I've got 14 or 15 different varieties with me.
[54:51.010 --> 54:54.130]  I'll let you pick something out of there. Bring it on. Bring it on. He said,
[54:54.290 --> 54:56.650]  I like it. Which would you like to try first?
[55:00.870 --> 55:04.350]  You just put me on the spot. Uh, I kinda oddly enough,
[55:04.350 --> 55:07.030]  I kind of want to taste that cheesy one. All right, I will load that up.
[55:07.070 --> 55:10.070]  Excellent. Thank you. That's, I've got a little, uh, my little,
[55:10.350 --> 55:12.470]  what's the person that comes and handles the wine for you?
[55:12.630 --> 55:14.190]  I've got to weave one of those now. Yeah.
[55:14.910 --> 55:17.550]  So you guys said something earlier that, uh,
[55:17.550 --> 55:18.550]  we've talked about a lot of things,
[55:18.550 --> 55:21.310]  but one of the things you said just out of conversation really stuck with me.
[55:21.730 --> 55:23.170]  I never thought of things this way,
[55:23.170 --> 55:26.330]  which makes me think that a lot of other people probably never thought of it.
[55:26.330 --> 55:29.810]  This way. You made a statement that we didn't, I should mention,
[55:29.830 --> 55:31.130]  you guys are from another state.
[55:31.130 --> 55:34.490]  You guys left Arkansas because it wasn't so cannabis friendly. Uh,
[55:34.510 --> 55:35.850]  there was an incident, uh,
[55:35.890 --> 55:38.290]  that maybe you might want to touch on after we smoke a bowl.
[55:38.290 --> 55:39.410]  I'm not going to force anything out of you,
[55:39.430 --> 55:43.570]  but you had a discrimination incident and you guys realized Arkansas sucks.
[55:43.570 --> 55:46.770]  We need to get out of here and go to Colorado. And you said,
[55:46.970 --> 55:49.770]  not all people are coming here just to get high.
[55:49.950 --> 55:54.630]  They're coming here just to get away and be free because Arkansas and the other
[55:54.630 --> 55:58.430]  places that people are coming from aren't very friendly and aren't very fun to
[55:58.450 --> 56:02.710]  be in. So maybe we need to, I, and the people in Colorado,
[56:02.790 --> 56:05.750]  we should be a little more friendly because they're not coming here just to get
[56:05.750 --> 56:09.590]  high. That's a bonus. It's cool here, but also the other side,
[56:09.810 --> 56:12.990]  it just sucks where they're coming from. They don't want to be there. Uh,
[56:13.030 --> 56:17.190]  they're discriminated against, uh, they are pulled over and harassed.
[56:17.250 --> 56:21.530]  And if you could just move to another state and not face that, why wouldn't you?
[56:21.970 --> 56:26.210]  Yeah, that, that's what I tell everyone. You know, when I hear that phrase,
[56:27.130 --> 56:30.450]  that people move to Colorado to get high, um,
[56:31.210 --> 56:35.010]  we can get high anywhere. We, you can get weed anywhere in any 50,
[56:35.410 --> 56:36.650]  any 50 of these states,
[56:36.650 --> 56:39.410]  anywhere in the world we've ever visited, you know, and it's,
[56:39.410 --> 56:43.290]  it's a pretty decent selection. You know, it's, it's not just about getting high.
[56:43.870 --> 56:44.910]  For us, for us,
[56:44.910 --> 56:47.750]  it was about freedom and not being locked in a cage like an animal.
[56:48.030 --> 56:50.470]  And we're very passionate about that because we had some,
[56:50.870 --> 56:54.950]  we had some incidents with canine units and, um,
[56:55.150 --> 57:00.150]  so it definitely made us appreciate our freedom and we wanted to secure that
[57:01.230 --> 57:03.550]  freedom. And we knew if we wanted to secure that freedom,
[57:03.550 --> 57:06.150]  we had to get out of that state. So, yeah.
[57:06.150 --> 57:10.270]  And in the process we are the advocates that we are now and here to help other
[57:10.270 --> 57:11.110]  people.
[57:12.930 --> 57:15.650]  Do you want to touch on the story you told at all or would we just rather leave
[57:15.650 --> 57:16.490]  it at that?
[57:16.570 --> 57:18.810]  Um, yeah, sure. Do you want to smoke this first?
[57:19.050 --> 57:21.370]  How about I'll take a bong hit while you tell your story?
[57:21.370 --> 57:24.570]  Oh sure. Perfect. Does anybody, I've got a torch, I'll just use the torch.
[57:24.890 --> 57:27.730]  Yeah. We each have our own, um,
[57:28.970 --> 57:33.170]  harassment story if you will, that both affected our livelihoods,
[57:33.210 --> 57:38.290]  career, college, um, different things that have happened.
[57:38.310 --> 57:41.590]  Um, unfortunately it's happened to a lot of people that we know where we're
[57:41.590 --> 57:46.110]  from. And so I'll just share that. Um,
[57:46.390 --> 57:51.390]  I was a public school teacher for eight years and I was a department head and I
[57:51.990 --> 57:56.270]  was very, very heavily involved with my school and, um,
[57:56.390 --> 57:59.790]  oh, I don't want to get emotional talking about it. Yeah.
[58:00.110 --> 58:02.390]  Skip anything you don't want to say. And if you're uncomfortable,
[58:02.390 --> 58:03.870]  we could skip right over it. I promise.
[58:03.950 --> 58:06.310]  Oh no, it's like people need to know and I'm okay with that.
[58:06.310 --> 58:11.010]  I just told you about it earlier. So just like, um, you know,
[58:11.030 --> 58:12.010]  I like to smoke weed.
[58:12.010 --> 58:16.290]  I love to smoke weed and it makes me a better person and I use it for medicine
[58:16.530 --> 58:20.610]  for very different reasons. And I always have. And, um,
[58:20.650 --> 58:25.650]  one day I left school on an afternoon and I pulled out in front of someone and
[58:27.250 --> 58:30.890]  that person honked at me, but they weren't going to hit me. And so, you know,
[58:30.890 --> 58:35.130]  we kept driving and I was being followed by an unmarked canine unit.
[58:35.630 --> 58:39.990]  And, um, I was pulled over and when I'd rolled my window down, um,
[58:40.030 --> 58:44.870]  it's kind of like just when the harassment started and he was asking me when was
[58:44.870 --> 58:46.830]  the last time I had smoked marijuana.
[58:48.470 --> 58:49.310]  I just kind of laughed.
[58:49.910 --> 58:50.750]  The window came down.
[58:50.750 --> 58:55.350]  Yes, yes. And, um, and you know,
[58:55.350 --> 58:59.750]  I want to say that this happens on a daily basis where we're from and I never
[58:59.750 --> 59:02.070]  thought it would happen to me, especially so,
[59:02.530 --> 59:04.650]  and then the situation and timing that it did.
[59:05.050 --> 59:09.170]  And so I just kind of laughed and I was like, excuse me. And he's like,
[59:09.170 --> 59:13.170]  I can smell marijuana when you roll down your window. And, um, he's,
[59:13.170 --> 59:15.770]  can I search your car? And I said, no, you may not.
[59:16.110 --> 59:20.450]  And at that time I didn't know that he had the authority above me to search my
[59:20.450 --> 59:23.810]  car anyway. There was a Supreme court ruling several years ago.
[59:24.010 --> 59:26.010]  If you are pulled over by a canine unit,
[59:26.210 --> 59:29.050]  they have the authority to search your vehicle against your consent.
[59:29.070 --> 59:34.070]  Well, just to clarify that if the dog quote unquote hits on your car,
[59:34.150 --> 59:37.830]  they have the legal right to search your vehicle. Um,
[59:38.070 --> 59:39.390]  and we all know,
[59:40.350 --> 59:43.110]  we all know how easy it is to make a dog do something.
[59:43.110 --> 59:46.550]  And you're not allowed to know what that hit looks like. Yeah. So there's,
[59:46.590 --> 59:47.430]  they don't really have to.
[59:47.430 --> 59:49.950]  Basically right now I could be the dog and I'm hitting on your car. Right.
[59:49.950 --> 59:53.670]  Watch right now. Could that have been the hit? Yes. I didn't do anything.
[59:53.670 --> 59:57.190]  You guys do shit. I just sat here. Exactly. You know,
[59:57.210 --> 01:00:00.050]  so is the hit when they're quiet or is it when they're barking loud or you
[01:00:00.050 --> 01:00:03.930]  know, whatever it may be, right, right to this direction. Exactly. Yeah.
[01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:08.690]  So they searched, he searched my car twice, called up for backup. Um, he,
[01:00:08.690 --> 01:00:10.890]  you know, went through my car, dumped everything out,
[01:00:10.890 --> 01:00:13.630]  went through my driver's manual cause that's where I would keep my drugs I
[01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:18.630]  guess. And, um, and he found my school badge and he knows,
[01:00:19.330 --> 01:00:24.330]  you know who I worked for and they had to let me go cause I was innocent.
[01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:28.230]  There was nothing in my car. There was no smell in my car.
[01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:31.830]  I will say that until the day that I died, there was no reason.
[01:00:31.870 --> 01:00:35.550]  It was a fairly new car to harass me. It was a brand new car.
[01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:37.550]  I've never even smoked in my car.
[01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:42.790]  You do not look like a drug user. I'm not trying to be discriminatory.
[01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:45.790]  You're not, you look healthy. You don't have,
[01:00:45.870 --> 01:00:49.750]  you don't show any of the signs of drug use. Like any of your eyes are,
[01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.950]  you're dabbing right now. Your eyes aren't red. I can't even tell.
[01:00:52.210 --> 01:00:53.650]  People have told me that my whole life.
[01:00:53.890 --> 01:00:55.890]  People don't even know if I'm high cause my eyes do not turn.
[01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.690]  In school you would have been one of the girls I would have been like,
[01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.490]  I don't know if she should know I'm smoking at lunch. I know. Right.
[01:01:02.810 --> 01:01:05.210]  I don't know if she's supposed to know that. Thank you. Thank you.
[01:01:05.210 --> 01:01:08.210]  And I've gotten that from other people. And so like I said,
[01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:11.850]  so they had to let me go. And so this was on a Friday afternoon. Um,
[01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:14.410]  so I thought I was fine. And when he had to let me go,
[01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:19.430]  he did not give me a citation, not a warning, a ticket or anything, nothing.
[01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:24.250]  Okay. So I thought I was okay. Um, I go to school on Monday.
[01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:29.250]  I service two schools and apparently this officer had written a report to this
[01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:35.690]  two school resource officers of the two schools that I worked at who then
[01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:38.090]  reported it to my principals.
[01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:43.050]  Reported that he pulled you over, harassed you and found nothing.
[01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:48.050]  Yes. And I was not cited. That's what, yeah.
[01:01:48.190 --> 01:01:50.190]  And they didn't let me read the report.
[01:01:50.190 --> 01:01:53.550]  At that point doesn't the officer get in the car and go dispatch.
[01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:57.430]  I ain't found shit. She's going home. I'm going to go fuck with someone else.
[01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:00.070]  Isn't that an end? Isn't that the end of that story?
[01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.590]  You would think it's hard to wrap your mind around.
[01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:06.630]  Around. I need to go tell that these other cops that I didn't find anything.
[01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:11.070]  Other cops need to tell other people that nobody found anything.
[01:02:11.070 --> 01:02:14.430]  So I guess what? They're just going to walk beside me every day. Talk to me,
[01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:17.790]  look at my, go check out my car in the parking lot just to figure out if,
[01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:21.670]  you know, like what's going on or something. I know it's ridiculous.
[01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:25.470]  It's mind blowing. So, um, at 10 o'clock Monday morning,
[01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:30.310]  I was called in to a meeting with the principals from both schools and they
[01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:33.590]  told me about this report. Um, since I worked for a state agency,
[01:02:33.590 --> 01:02:37.990]  I did not know this at the time. They had the legality to investigate it. Um,
[01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:41.910]  if you work for, you know, um, an employer that's not the state,
[01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:43.670]  then they don't have that right.
[01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:48.610]  So they questioned me and bullied me and harassed me
[01:02:49.050 --> 01:02:53.410]  and grabbed my arm across the table and asked me if I was
[01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.690]  okay. If I needed help,
[01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:58.930]  you grabbed my arm when you were telling me the story earlier and grabbed me to
[01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:03.410]  explain how hard they grabbed. That's assault. Yeah. They assaulted you.
[01:03:03.410 --> 01:03:05.210]  They intimidated you. They bullied you. They,
[01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:07.690]  they tried all kinds of terrible shit against you.
[01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:11.690]  They did. And I broke down and then I just kind of went crazy for a second.
[01:03:11.710 --> 01:03:13.750]  I'd like to give Cheryl credit. She, you know,
[01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:18.390]  bullying is a hot topic in our public schools as it should be. Yes.
[01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:21.870]  And, um, they were absolutely bullying her. Well,
[01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:26.310]  from the moment she got pulled over. And so, yeah, she called them out on that.
[01:03:26.310 --> 01:03:30.510]  You know what we, what we try to teach our students, um, is what you,
[01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:33.550]  not to do is what you are doing to me right now. Yeah.
[01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.870]  The hypocrisy is enormous.
[01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:39.550]  If they're profiling you, like you are a
[01:03:40.490 --> 01:03:44.530]  five foot something average weight white girl.
[01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:49.290]  I mean, they're profiling you in a new car. You're dressed well.
[01:03:49.290 --> 01:03:51.970]  I mean, you look clean, you got a new jacket, like shoes.
[01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:55.530]  You don't look like maybe I'm profiling drug users or something.
[01:03:55.530 --> 01:03:58.450]  You don't have any of the signs of somebody that the cops need to fuck with for
[01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:01.730]  drug use. And that's where it's like, where we're from. Who else are they profiling?
[01:04:01.730 --> 01:04:03.130]  Exactly. Like you were able,
[01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:08.050]  you are educated and articulate and happen to be lucky enough to have white
[01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:10.430]  privilege and they're fucking with you.
[01:04:10.510 --> 01:04:14.830]  Imagine what they're doing to the impoverished people that aren't dressed as
[01:04:14.830 --> 01:04:18.730]  well as you, that don't have the mindset that you do to defend yourself mentally.
[01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:20.470]  Imagine what's happening to them.
[01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:21.670]  Yeah. And you can drive,
[01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:25.450]  you can drive around this town and just like many other town and it's not a
[01:04:25.450 --> 01:04:28.830]  small town. I mean, this is, you know, pretty fairly developed area.
[01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:30.670]  This is happening all over.
[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:35.390]  And it is this guy's sole job to drive around with
[01:04:35.390 --> 01:04:38.730]  this canine unit all day long and harass people.
[01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:42.290]  And this one town has two officers that do that.
[01:04:42.370 --> 01:04:44.970]  That's their only responsibility is to drive around.
[01:04:45.290 --> 01:04:46.530]  We had just been voted.
[01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.410]  And you see it, especially after her incident, we would be driving around.
[01:04:50.410 --> 01:04:53.450]  We're like, Oh gosh. And we, you know, we would have those flashbacks.
[01:04:53.450 --> 01:04:58.010]  And we were rated number one school district in the state.
[01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:02.970]  And we were rated number one safest city in the state.
[01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:07.990]  And this is going on on the reg daily. Yeah.
[01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:10.710]  And so then, you know, so, so back to the meeting.
[01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:15.350]  So I start telling them that they're bullies and how ridiculous this is.
[01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:18.310]  And, um, in what, you know, one principal was like,
[01:05:18.310 --> 01:05:22.310]  I have never noticed you under the influence, anything at school. And I was like,
[01:05:22.310 --> 01:05:25.870]  yeah, you fucking shouldn't. I've never brought anything onto this campus.
[01:05:25.990 --> 01:05:29.390]  I didn't even admit to anything. I had nothing to deny or admit to.
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.630]  They couldn't drug test me either. Um, they hadn't, you know,
[01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.370]  no basis to, but no, you know, we got on, we got on this story.
[01:05:36.530 --> 01:05:39.330]  This is just a good reminder for everyone. This is what we,
[01:05:39.570 --> 01:05:43.050]  this is what the cannabis refugees escape. You know,
[01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:46.850]  it's every single day this is going on. So again,
[01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:51.530]  it's not just about getting high. This is about escaping harassment.
[01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.370]  Harassment.
[01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:57.710]  Oh yeah. And, um, yeah. And so then after that meeting,
[01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:02.130]  like it was the one principal just ended it. Um, one Prince, the other principal,
[01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:06.270]  he never spoke to me ever again up until the day I moved.
[01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:09.450]  He never said another word to me. The other principal,
[01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.490]  he spoke to me every day after that.
[01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:16.710]  And both school resource officers spoke to me every single day
[01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:19.510]  after that. And one of them, I didn't even know if he knew my name.
[01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.870]  And he spoke to me every day.
[01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:25.270]  And I know they went out there with my car when we weren't looking because
[01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:28.710]  they'll go out there and look at teacher's cars and then email. Um,
[01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:33.330]  we will be issuing citations for expired tags. Um, you know,
[01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:37.130]  be sure to check your tags to see if they're expiring this month.
[01:06:37.610 --> 01:06:39.570]  I mean, ridiculous shit like that.
[01:06:39.610 --> 01:06:44.610]  Police day backwards police day. It is fucking real in the South.
[01:06:45.210 --> 01:06:48.930]  And so that's what we were kind of dealing with. And so I, I, you know, I just,
[01:06:49.090 --> 01:06:52.650]  the paranoia just was intense at that moment. And, um,
[01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:56.890]  we just decided this is not well for us. And I will say like Jeremy and I were,
[01:06:56.890 --> 01:07:01.630]  we were wanting to move anyway and this just kind of ignited it. And now,
[01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:05.350]  um, it was, yeah, that, I guess that moment,
[01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:09.710]  that night that I went home ended up being one of the greatest moments, um,
[01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:10.590]  for our future.
[01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:15.990]  And now here we are. Yeah. And life is completely different now.
[01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:20.110]  You guys happy you're here now. I can tell. Yeah. Hey,
[01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:23.350]  do you remember 40 minutes ago when you're like, Oh no, I'm not going to talk.
[01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:24.410]  I'm not going to be on the podcast.
[01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:29.690]  And here I am telling you my inner secrets.
[01:07:30.010 --> 01:07:30.850]  Yeah.
[01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:35.050]  Yes, yes. You're right.
[01:07:35.090 --> 01:07:37.610]  You don't get Southern until you tell that story.
[01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:41.650]  I noticed it. I was like, Oh, there it is.
[01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:48.730]  You know, I got emotional there for a second and now, now I'm okay. Now,
[01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:52.410]  I now feel good. I'm like, wow, I can breathe all of a sudden. That feels good.
[01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:57.890]  Yeah, it really does. It does. And so, you know, um,
[01:07:58.090 --> 01:08:02.810]  I hope that there's a big evolution and change in our public school systems and
[01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:06.250]  educating our students and just teachers as well.
[01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:07.810]  I was going to say we have to educate the adults.
[01:08:07.810 --> 01:08:11.050]  I think the kids are catching on. They see it. They will. They've got, yeah.
[01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:13.690]  The TV is teaching the kids that weed school. Oh yeah.
[01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.490]  Social media adults are the ones that we have to reprogram.
[01:08:17.650 --> 01:08:18.470]  I love that.
[01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:23.250]  And yeah, it is like my grandparents were taught that weed was the
[01:08:23.250 --> 01:08:26.950]  devil. That if white people smoke weed, you'll be raping white bitches.
[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:30.110]  You're going to like, yeah. And my grandparents, fortunately enough,
[01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:31.910]  they were pretty cool. They were, they were down,
[01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:33.630]  but I'm sure they had friends that were like,
[01:08:33.630 --> 01:08:35.990]  you shouldn't be smoking that devil weed. You know, that's,
[01:08:36.030 --> 01:08:37.870]  but that's what the generation was taught then.
[01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:39.070]  And then the hippies were like, no,
[01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:42.590]  we're going to smoke weed and all the hippies kids, that's me. You know?
[01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:44.910]  And I'm like, yeah, I smoked weed. Like I saw my parents do it.
[01:08:44.910 --> 01:08:47.630]  And now my daughter's generation, I'm sure that's, you know,
[01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:49.950]  they're all going to be a bunch of potheads cause they can go to the store and
[01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:50.430]  get it now.
[01:08:50.450 --> 01:08:53.090]  They don't have to go to some weird Gates house and watch them feed his iguana
[01:08:53.090 --> 01:08:54.370]  for an hour to buy a bag of weed.
[01:08:57.090 --> 01:08:58.010]  That's how it used to be.
[01:08:58.330 --> 01:09:01.890]  I like to say that if I did not have to go to my drug dealer's house to buy
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:03.370]  weed, I never would have bought LSD.
[01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:06.370]  Because if I was going to a dispensary where they only sold marijuana,
[01:09:06.370 --> 01:09:10.210]  I would have only known about marijuana. But my, my weed dealer was like,
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:13.250]  I have acid too. I was like, sounds fun. Give me a couple of those.
[01:09:14.290 --> 01:09:15.130]  That's just how it went.
[01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:17.950]  That's the only reason it's a gateway drug. Yeah.
[01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:21.470]  So I smoked some bong hits of the cheesy firefly. Oh, I want to,
[01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:25.390]  I took two big bong ribs. I'm not sure how much is left after I hit it.
[01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:27.710]  Oh, okay. I'll reload it. And so what were your thoughts?
[01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:31.070]  It's spicy in a good way. Uh,
[01:09:31.310 --> 01:09:33.550]  it is cheesy and it is funky,
[01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.110]  but it definitely went straight to my eyes.
[01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:40.310]  Like my body didn't get high from it. I didn't feel much head change,
[01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.190]  but I got like when you get that stone,
[01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.610]  like I got eye high from it. My eyelids got real heavy, not tired,
[01:09:45.970 --> 01:09:49.130]  but like I call it an eye high and I dig that. Uh,
[01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:52.010]  dabs don't have eye high, whatever's in cannabis.
[01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:56.770]  We're not passing that along to the dabs. I agree. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:09:56.770 --> 01:09:59.850]  All right. Well, your eyes, you've taken as many dabs as myself.
[01:09:59.850 --> 01:10:01.890]  And now a bong hit and your eyes don't seem to get red at all.
[01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:05.530]  It's my hidden talent. Nice. That's,
[01:10:07.530 --> 01:10:08.530]  that's my hidden talent.
[01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:10.990]  It's my hidden talent. Nice. That's
[01:10:13.150 --> 01:10:13.990]  eye drops.
[01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:18.470]  I'll be driving to work and rubbing my bottle of eye drops between my hands
[01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.110]  cause it's fucking winter and they're frozen. Like, ah, come on.
[01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:23.170]  I just got to get my eyes widened up for the drive.
[01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:26.170]  Just trying to sit on the eye drops and put them on the heater vent or
[01:10:26.170 --> 01:10:27.010]  something.
[01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:30.070]  Okay. I'm going to reload this real quick.
[01:10:30.150 --> 01:10:33.830]  We weren't prepared to smoke flower. We don't have all of the tools necessary.
[01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.950]  The equipment we need, an ashtray and a little poker.
[01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:39.370]  And she's got everything spread across the room.
[01:10:40.650 --> 01:10:42.930]  So where do we want to go from here? You've got some notes.
[01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:44.850]  Have we not covered anything on your notes?
[01:10:44.850 --> 01:10:47.210]  We pretty much covered everything on the, on the,
[01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:52.690]  growing in small environments. I would just say anyone who has questions
[01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:56.090]  about, if anyone wants me to help them,
[01:10:56.450 --> 01:10:58.850]  I'm far from an expert on growing. I mean,
[01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.330]  I still consider myself a fairly new grower,
[01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:05.930]  but if you have challenges in tiny spaces, you know,
[01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:08.170]  there's so much knowledge out there on YouTube, of course,
[01:11:08.170 --> 01:11:11.490]  and most people are already there. You don't need me to tell you that,
[01:11:11.490 --> 01:11:15.650]  but reach out to me on love for the plant on Instagram. I'm happy to,
[01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:19.450]  I've helped multiple people. Um, in fact, there, there are,
[01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:22.570]  there are a couple of people that have the exact same setup as mine.
[01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:24.570]  They modeled modeled it after mine.
[01:11:24.570 --> 01:11:27.290]  So it's been fun to actually see that play out.
[01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:30.370]  Isn't it fun getting people going and seeing the progress that people make and
[01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:33.610]  you feel like, ah, my, my stepping stones got them that far. Yeah.
[01:11:33.670 --> 01:11:37.390]  But it's also a reminder how small environmental differences can make a big
[01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:38.870]  difference. Absolutely. You know,
[01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:41.230]  they are in a different state and they're like, dude,
[01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:46.230]  I have the exact same setup as you, but you know, I'm having these hit issues.
[01:11:48.790 --> 01:11:50.070]  But it's all manageable.
[01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:56.910]  We're waiting for your review. Here you go. There's a big green hit for you.
[01:11:57.670 --> 01:11:59.430]  Oh, you found a lighter. I went at it with the torch.
[01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:02.770]  Oh, I'm so sorry. Okay. I went in. Um,
[01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:08.370]  definitely funky funk. I think. Yeah. There's some funk, but a good funk.
[01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:11.890]  Yes, definitely. It actually, um,
[01:12:11.930 --> 01:12:15.610]  the aftertaste I like even better than the smell on that one.
[01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:18.650]  It'll, it'll creep up on you too. It'll get, uh, it'll get different.
[01:12:18.770 --> 01:12:20.330]  Yeah. I guess because I had told you like,
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:24.050]  I tend to not be a fan of the chems or the diesels or the gas.
[01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:27.610]  So that tastes even better than I expected to. Maybe it's the cheese.
[01:12:28.390 --> 01:12:30.510]  Maybe it's the cheese and I love cheese.
[01:12:32.710 --> 01:12:36.750]  All right. What did you think just now? Uh, definitely the, I, the,
[01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:39.790]  it goes straight to the eyes, right? Yeah. Yeah. It just went straight to my face.
[01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:42.950]  Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. I agree. Yes it does.
[01:12:44.750 --> 01:12:46.030]  No, not, they probably look this way.
[01:12:46.030 --> 01:12:47.890]  So make sure you follow these guys on Instagram. You guys,
[01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:49.590]  they post great photos. Uh,
[01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:52.310]  these obviously got a lot of knowledge on small space grows.
[01:12:52.350 --> 01:12:54.510]  So if you're looking for information on small space grows,
[01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:56.910]  you want someone to interact with or share your grow with, uh,
[01:12:57.090 --> 01:12:59.770]  they have great conversation. Also. They're great people to talk to.
[01:12:59.770 --> 01:13:01.010]  I'm sure you could tell by the podcast,
[01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:03.730]  but they're as friendly on social media as they are in person.
[01:13:04.050 --> 01:13:05.130]  So I have some conversations.
[01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.610]  I'm sure he'll share all of his knowledge with you about small grows.
[01:13:07.930 --> 01:13:11.810]  I just follow him either way at love for the plant on Instagram,
[01:13:11.890 --> 01:13:14.570]  check out their grow. Thanks for coming. You guys,
[01:13:15.050 --> 01:13:18.690]  we've got plenty of time to ramble. Uh, we've covered all of the notes. What,
[01:13:18.690 --> 01:13:21.370]  uh, you guys want to chat about anything you'd like to say since you've got a
[01:13:21.370 --> 01:13:23.650]  microphone in your hand and I told you how many people listen,
[01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:25.730]  but I'm not going to remind you cause I don't want to make you nervous.
[01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:29.510]  Yeah. I just, Hey, I just wanted to give a shout out to normal. Um,
[01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:34.010]  and not only just normal, but any or any pro cannabis organization like them,
[01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:38.310]  these people are spending time up at the Capitol talking to politicians,
[01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:39.830]  educating them.
[01:13:40.190 --> 01:13:44.390]  And I understand that some of these organizations may not perfectly align with
[01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:47.210]  everything that, um, you believe,
[01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:50.070]  but it's very important that we stay united,
[01:13:50.070 --> 01:13:53.630]  especially in light of the Jeff sessions news. Um,
[01:13:53.650 --> 01:13:57.890]  we really need to unite and don't let small differences, um,
[01:13:57.890 --> 01:14:00.470]  break our unity. We really need to support,
[01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:05.170]  find an organization to support whichever one you want. We choose normal. Uh,
[01:14:05.170 --> 01:14:07.210]  we go, you know, they have an annual fundraiser.
[01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:10.770]  We just went to their fundraiser before Christmas. It was amazing.
[01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:14.490]  What an amazing event, but it could be so much better if more people would come
[01:14:14.490 --> 01:14:16.730]  out. Okay. So, you know, that's just one example,
[01:14:16.730 --> 01:14:18.570]  but get involved one way or another.
[01:14:18.570 --> 01:14:20.870]  You don't have to go talk to politicians yourself.
[01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:24.570]  Make a small donation to one of these organizations because they're,
[01:14:24.650 --> 01:14:27.470]  they are using that money. And you know,
[01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:31.530]  we probably wouldn't be sitting here where we are right now talking about
[01:14:31.530 --> 01:14:32.970]  cannabis on an,
[01:14:33.050 --> 01:14:37.650]  on an Apple product in a social smoking environment
[01:14:38.130 --> 01:14:41.370]  without some of these organizations. We have to remember that. So don't,
[01:14:41.530 --> 01:14:44.890]  don't throw them out because you disagree with them on one topic.
[01:14:45.210 --> 01:14:46.970]  We are where we are because of them.
[01:14:47.710 --> 01:14:48.750]  Is normal. Go ahead.
[01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:50.090]  Oh, I was going to say, um,
[01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:53.450]  even if there's not an organization that you can attend regular meetings,
[01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:56.430]  like we have the luxury to do, but even, um,
[01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:58.990]  just being more involved in what's going on in your city.
[01:14:59.790 --> 01:15:01.550]  That's right. Get involved. Mike would teach you that.
[01:15:02.190 --> 01:15:06.150]  Is normal the oldest cannabis activism, uh, group,
[01:15:06.230 --> 01:15:07.470]  or was there somebody before normal?
[01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:08.750]  That's a good question.
[01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:10.390]  Started in the seventies.
[01:15:10.430 --> 01:15:14.630]  Yeah. Well Tommy Chong is or Cheech is wearing a normal shirt in nice dreams.
[01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:15.770]  So that's how far I'm going.
[01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:19.090]  Yeah. Yeah. And that was the seventies.
[01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:23.210]  Support normal. It's the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws.
[01:15:23.210 --> 01:15:25.330]  It's normal without the a, if you're going to Google it,
[01:15:25.330 --> 01:15:29.210]  if you're going to search for it, uh, support something, support cannabis. Uh,
[01:15:29.210 --> 01:15:32.530]  of course I always ask you to support the show if you've already done that, uh,
[01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.730]  support normal or your favorite cannabis activism group.
[01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:41.290]  Yeah. And you know, I, Mike, white, uh, white Mike,
[01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:46.950]  sorry for messing up your, your name, cracker Mike. Yeah. Cracker Mike. Um,
[01:15:47.630 --> 01:15:49.190]  you know, I think he's mentioned it before,
[01:15:49.210 --> 01:15:51.110]  but some of the people that are against us,
[01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:54.910]  they are very active and they're very motivated and they are getting out there
[01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:59.630]  and they're, you know, they are, they hate cannabis.
[01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:02.290]  I think you guys said a couple of podcasts ago,
[01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:05.070]  they hate cannabis is like, we hate cancer. I mean,
[01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:08.950]  they have a very strong agenda and we need,
[01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.850]  if you are not willing to do that,
[01:16:10.970 --> 01:16:14.050]  you need to support an organization that is willing to do that because that's
[01:16:14.050 --> 01:16:18.730]  what we're up against. Yeah. Yeah. Vote. That's important. Um, yeah.
[01:16:18.810 --> 01:16:22.490]  Vote. So many people say my vote doesn't matter. Yes, it does.
[01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:26.730]  Go vote and see if it does, especially even on a small city level.
[01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:29.930]  So yeah, if the city is smaller, your vote matters even more.
[01:16:29.970 --> 01:16:33.170]  If there are only six people to vote and then I can convince four people of
[01:16:33.170 --> 01:16:35.890]  anything. I've got a big mouth and I'm persuasive.
[01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:38.110]  I can get four people to do whatever the fuck I want.
[01:16:38.110 --> 01:16:39.870]  And the other two fuck them cause I only need four.
[01:16:46.150 --> 01:16:47.350]  I was serious, but okay.
[01:16:48.830 --> 01:16:49.670]  So yeah, get out there and vote.
[01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:53.870]  Like Jeremy said, we have to unite as a cannabis community.
[01:16:54.550 --> 01:16:58.270]  Very true. Um, I know a lot of people want to move here because it's freedom,
[01:16:58.630 --> 01:17:02.350]  but if you can, if you were, if you have the white Mike type of mentality,
[01:17:02.370 --> 01:17:06.130]  if you have the activist type of mentality, if you were outspoken,
[01:17:07.090 --> 01:17:09.930]  do what you can do to help us legalize cannabis. Maybe,
[01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:13.410]  maybe you have a different type of cannabis podcast you want to put out there
[01:17:13.410 --> 01:17:15.650]  because this should not be the only cannabis podcast.
[01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:19.210]  I don't feel like I have the only platform for cannabis. There should be more.
[01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:21.050]  Help us speak.
[01:17:21.130 --> 01:17:25.450]  If you can go speak with politicians and educate them on cannabis, go do it.
[01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:28.730]  If you can teach anybody about cannabis, do it.
[01:17:28.730 --> 01:17:31.610]  If you have an illegal state and you can work toward legalization there,
[01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:34.950]  do it in the way that you can. If you're a musician and you're in a band,
[01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:38.750]  write a song about legalizing cannabis. If you're a can, I said cannabis,
[01:17:39.430 --> 01:17:42.590]  that's the fucking, the website. If you are an artist,
[01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:46.390]  paint something about legalizing cannabis. If you're a poet, right?
[01:17:46.390 --> 01:17:49.830]  I think I made my point. Do something, do your part, find your niche,
[01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.070]  fill the, fill the void,
[01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:55.030]  help us legalize cannabis everywhere so that people don't have to leave their
[01:17:55.030 --> 01:17:58.310]  home states so that teachers don't have to be harassed by cops.
[01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:59.750]  You're a hundred pound woman.
[01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:01.770]  You shouldn't be harassed by grown ass men for nothing.
[01:18:02.130 --> 01:18:03.290]  Like that's gotta be intimidating.
[01:18:03.610 --> 01:18:07.170]  I'm a big dude and two cops scare me so I can only imagine what it'd be like.
[01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.570]  Like you're basically defenseless when two dudes come around like two dudes and
[01:18:10.570 --> 01:18:14.330]  you lose. I'm sorry. And a big German shepherd and a big German shepherd. Yeah.
[01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:16.330]  Fuck that dog. I don't want to get bitten. I'm scared.
[01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:18.290]  So I can only imagine what it would be like to be you.
[01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:21.450]  You got to remember people don't want to leave their homes. No,
[01:18:21.690 --> 01:18:24.890]  I don't want a lot of people don't want to have to go anywhere. I'm comfortable.
[01:18:24.890 --> 01:18:28.570]  My stuff is there at moving sucks. I'd rather live in a shitty house.
[01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:34.290]  It's like looking for another job. It just sucks. No fun.
[01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.250]  So fight for legalization. You guys support something.
[01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:40.330]  If you don't agree with normal, uh, if there, if you,
[01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:44.290]  if you were educated enough to have made a decision that you don't agree with
[01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:47.690]  normal, you probably have found an organization that you do support.
[01:18:47.930 --> 01:18:50.250]  If you have done that much research and you're against normal,
[01:18:50.570 --> 01:18:52.770]  that you've probably picked a team contribute to them.
[01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:56.090]  It doesn't have to be normal. It could be ASA. It could be whoever,
[01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:59.050]  it could be local, it could be national, it could be state. Help us out,
[01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:02.670]  please find your niche, play the song, paint the painting, write the poem,
[01:19:02.710 --> 01:19:06.830]  dance, the dance, put something on your race car.
[01:19:07.030 --> 01:19:09.950]  I don't know. That's a good one. Yeah.
[01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:11.990]  Let's get together and legalize cannabis. All right, you guys,
[01:19:12.010 --> 01:19:13.670]  I want to thank you once again for joining me for a podcast.
[01:19:13.670 --> 01:19:16.750]  I think we've gone for over an hour now and it's been nothing but greatness.
[01:19:17.270 --> 01:19:19.670]  Uh, we are going to smoke the other two phenotypes.
[01:19:19.670 --> 01:19:21.990]  We may not do it on the show, but we're going to do that before we leave here.
[01:19:22.270 --> 01:19:24.610]  I want to thank you once again for this delicious concentrate.
[01:19:24.610 --> 01:19:26.750]  We're going to have to take more dabs of that before we go anywhere.
[01:19:27.450 --> 01:19:30.010]  I like to wrap up the show by giving a shout out to people.
[01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:33.610]  Do you guys have anyone you would like to give a shout out to before we wrap up
[01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:36.450]  the podcast? You can both get one. You don't have to agree on it.
[01:19:37.050 --> 01:19:40.690]  Well, for me, it's the obvious. My mom, she was supportive of us.
[01:19:40.890 --> 01:19:44.250]  Really both of our moms were very supportive of us moving out here. It's not,
[01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:47.090]  it's not easy moving away from family. Um,
[01:19:47.210 --> 01:19:50.450]  but they've been fully supportive in regards to both of us,
[01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:54.890]  both us moving and everything cannabis related that we're doing. So.
[01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:58.910]  Yeah. And I want to give a shout out to all of our local Colorado family,
[01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:03.270]  like you included in the other growers that growers that we've met and we've
[01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.910]  really put ourselves out there with meetups and, you know,
[01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:08.390]  trying to build that community and become part of that community.
[01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:10.470]  And so we couldn't even be sitting here right there, you know,
[01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:12.830]  like today right now without that event last year.
[01:20:13.030 --> 01:20:15.670]  So thank you to all of the people that we've met.
[01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:17.470]  That's excellent. Thank you guys.
[01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:19.830]  I feel like that's a great way to wrap up this part of the podcast.
[01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:21.590]  Happy session.
[01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:23.750]  Happy session. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to smoke down.
[01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:26.610]  I'm going to wrap up this portion of the show and I will be back to put a bow
[01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:29.690]  on this bitch. Stay tuned. You guys. Bye. Bye.
