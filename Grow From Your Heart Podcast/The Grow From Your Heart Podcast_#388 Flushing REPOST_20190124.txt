[00:00.000 --> 00:04.400]  Welcome back, Weed World! It's time for Episode 388 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:04.400 --> 00:08.600]  Podcast. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company. If you
[00:08.600 --> 00:12.540]  need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[00:12.540 --> 00:19.880]  and you can find them at www.dankseed.store. It has become a tradition
[00:19.880 --> 00:23.680]  that I start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking. Today, I'm taking
[00:23.680 --> 00:28.680]  dabs of Fatso OG from Green Dot Labs. This is the Fatso OG Full Spectrum
[00:28.680 --> 00:32.440]  Extract. It's nice and chunky. It's got just the right amount of chunky crystals
[00:32.440 --> 00:35.560]  and just the right amount of Terp Sauce in there. I really do approve of that
[00:35.560 --> 00:41.240]  ratio. The cross on this, or the blend actually, is GMO and Legend OG. The flavor
[00:41.240 --> 00:45.800]  is described as dark roast coffee, garlic, and fuel, and I feel like that is
[00:45.800 --> 00:49.760]  absolutely accurate. It has given me some ridiculous cottonmouth. I feel like you
[00:49.760 --> 00:53.080]  can almost hear it on the microphone. Ladies and gentlemen, I have been having
[00:53.080 --> 00:56.760]  a really busy couple of weeks. I've been out of town twice. I'm going back out of
[00:56.920 --> 01:01.080]  town Thursday. I have a comedy show in Denver. Then I will be attending the
[01:01.080 --> 01:06.880]  Endo Expo in Denver on Saturday and Sunday, so I am doing another repost for
[01:06.880 --> 01:10.960]  this episode. The last episode was determining ripeness. Now that we know
[01:10.960 --> 01:15.440]  when the plants are ripe, it is time to begin flushing our plants. I feel that
[01:15.440 --> 01:19.280]  many new growers and many experienced growers overlook the importance of
[01:19.280 --> 01:23.400]  flushing our plants, and it is not happening properly. I'm gonna say this in
[01:23.400 --> 01:27.000]  the episode over and over again, but flushing is free, and it can improve the
[01:27.000 --> 01:31.120]  overall quality of your finished product, so why wouldn't we focus heavily on
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.280]  flushing at the end of the growth cycle? I'm sure I'm gonna say that plenty of
[01:35.280 --> 01:38.720]  times through this episode, so with no further ado, let's jump right into an
[01:38.720 --> 01:43.440]  episode about flushing our ripe cannabis plants before harvest. Welcome back,
[01:43.440 --> 01:47.120]  cannabis community. It's time for episode 320 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:47.120 --> 01:50.280]  This episode is brought to you by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.040]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.320]  Company, and you can find them at dankseed.store. Also, make sure you check
[01:58.320 --> 02:03.880]  out our friends at PL Grow Systems. You can find them at PLGrow.Systems. Ladies
[02:03.880 --> 02:08.640]  and gentlemen, first off, let me apologize for my terrible sounding voice. Our
[02:08.640 --> 02:13.240]  friend Brett, also known as Mary's Motivation, had a going-away party, and I
[02:13.240 --> 02:17.920]  went to that going-away party, and I smoked way too much flour and way too
[02:17.920 --> 02:21.360]  much concentrate, and my voice sounds like crap. I got a little bit of a chest
[02:21.360 --> 02:24.840]  cold. I got a throat thing going on. I got a sinus thing happening, and before we
[02:24.840 --> 02:28.440]  get too far, I just want to apologize, and I want to thank you for listening to
[02:28.440 --> 02:32.880]  this episode while I sound like poop. All right, I'd like to start the episode off
[02:32.880 --> 02:37.040]  by letting you know what I'm smoking on. Today, I'm taking little baby dabs of
[02:37.040 --> 02:41.280]  Gorilla Glue 4 Ambrosia, and also I've got some of the New York City Diesel
[02:41.280 --> 02:46.400]  Ambrosia batter, both from Apothecary. It's been a nice mix. I'm just going light
[02:46.400 --> 02:49.520]  today, just trying to stay lightly medicated, not mess up my lungs and
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.520]  throat again. I'm on the path to recovery, and I want to keep moving forward. So a
[02:54.520 --> 02:58.160]  minute ago, I mentioned that I went to my friend Brett, also known as Mary's
[02:58.160 --> 03:02.240]  Motivation. I went to Brett's going-away party. Brett is leaving the country.
[03:02.240 --> 03:05.720]  Brett's a little scared and nervous about his trip, but honestly, I don't
[03:05.720 --> 03:10.160]  think anybody deserves this more. Brett needs to make this adventure happen. I
[03:10.160 --> 03:13.360]  think it's going to be a great experience for him, so I'm super proud
[03:13.360 --> 03:19.360]  and super excited for him. His party was awesome. At the party, we were joined by,
[03:19.360 --> 03:24.040]  of course, the always awesome Brett was there, Dabbing Granny, and Kevin
[03:24.040 --> 03:29.200]  showed up. Also, Lucy, Mama Bear Dabs, was there. Always good to see Lucy. I got to
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.760]  bump into my friend Twisty Seeds, who I don't see very often. I got to have a
[03:32.760 --> 03:36.240]  conversation, a long conversation, with Chandler Dabbing. That was pretty cool.
[03:36.240 --> 03:41.520]  Earl Tycoon was there. The dude from Hits on Hand was there. LJ Fresh was there, and
[03:41.520 --> 03:45.600]  several other new and old friends were there hanging out. It was a great party.
[03:45.600 --> 03:49.960]  There were a couple of folks there who brought canna-gars, which are basically
[03:49.960 --> 03:54.880]  blunts rolled with cannabis leaves as the wrapper. That really fucked up my
[03:54.880 --> 03:59.200]  lungs, you guys. My lungs did not like that at all. They were delicious to smoke,
[03:59.200 --> 04:04.480]  and we got really lit, but that is why I think I sound like crap today. So, shout
[04:04.480 --> 04:07.800]  out to Brett for the great party. The party was a private party, so not a lot
[04:07.800 --> 04:12.000]  of people were invited. The event was at Cultivated Synergy. I owe a huge shout
[04:12.000 --> 04:15.480]  out to everybody at Cultivated Synergy. Every time we do an event there, every
[04:15.480 --> 04:19.600]  time we do a large or a small party there, it goes very well. The place is
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.320]  very inviting, the staff is very accommodating, and I always have a great
[04:23.320 --> 04:27.480]  time. So, big shout out to everybody who came to the party. Extra huge shout out
[04:27.480 --> 04:31.400]  to Brett for inviting me, who was only able to invite 30 people. I was honored
[04:31.400 --> 04:36.320]  to be amongst those 30. It was a great party, you guys. We smoked that place out
[04:36.320 --> 04:39.360]  for how few people there were in there. It was a pretty big building, and we
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.560]  smoked that bitch out pretty good. You can hear it in my voice still. All right,
[04:43.560 --> 04:47.360]  while I've still got some good voice left, let's do a quick podcast about
[04:47.360 --> 04:52.160]  flushing your plants before harvest. Before we talk about flushing, I should
[04:52.160 --> 04:57.800]  do a quick recap. In the last episode, I talked about determining ripeness. Mike
[04:57.800 --> 05:01.960]  and I went fairly fast, and we got kind of rambly, so I hope I made it clear that
[05:01.960 --> 05:05.960]  determining ripeness is usually done by using some sort of a loop so that you
[05:06.000 --> 05:12.360]  can see the trichomes. I mentioned using a 60 or 100x loop. One of our friends
[05:12.360 --> 05:17.600]  from Instagram, what's up Dank Sinatra? Our friend Dank Sinatra, sheer photo and
[05:17.600 --> 05:22.560]  seeds, sent me a message, and he says, now, I can't see trichomes with my naked eye,
[05:22.560 --> 05:28.000]  but I can tell ripeness of a trichome with a 16x jeweler's loop. He said, of
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.880]  course, in my mind, I'm in my mid-20s, so my eyes may work a little better. Yes, dude,
[05:33.880 --> 05:38.680]  you are a little bit younger than me, you got those fresh new eyes, but he
[05:38.680 --> 05:42.800]  corrected me. He says he can see the trichomes with a 16x jeweler's loop, so
[05:42.800 --> 05:47.840]  you may not need that bigger loop, that 60, that 100. He says the 60 is working, or
[05:47.840 --> 05:52.840]  the 16 is working for him. So I stand corrected. You may not need that big loop.
[05:52.840 --> 05:57.880]  16 may get you through. Also, let's recap a little bit about what I said about
[05:57.880 --> 06:02.840]  harvest times. I said that if you have a plant that is said to go 60 days, let it
[06:02.840 --> 06:06.960]  go the full 60 days and start flushing at day 50. If you've got a plant that's
[06:06.960 --> 06:11.720]  supposed to go 70 days, let it go the full 70 days and start flushing around
[06:11.720 --> 06:17.040]  day 60. Now, you may say, Rasta Jeff, I want to dial it in and cut these plants
[06:17.040 --> 06:20.920]  down at the perfect ripeness. Yes, you're going to have to dial that in. Something
[06:20.920 --> 06:25.200]  I wanted to stress is this is not your last grow with this strain. Hopefully,
[06:25.200 --> 06:29.320]  this is your first run with this cultivar, with this cut. So now you've got
[06:29.320 --> 06:32.640]  a new girlfriend that you've got to learn a little bit. You've got to take
[06:32.640 --> 06:36.320]  her out a couple of times. You got to see if she wants to come down at day 60,
[06:36.320 --> 06:43.640]  day 63, maybe day 67, maybe day 72. You've got to dial it in exactly to the right
[06:43.640 --> 06:47.240]  day. Now, you're going to see differences. If you use different nutrients, you may
[06:47.240 --> 06:50.680]  get different ripening days. If you have a little bit of temperature difference,
[06:50.680 --> 06:54.520]  you may get a different ripening day. So you're going to have to find the window
[06:54.520 --> 06:58.600]  and dial that in. Hopefully, this is not your last grow with this cut. Hopefully,
[06:58.720 --> 07:03.240]  this is the first of many grows with a good cut. So if it's your first run with
[07:03.240 --> 07:08.160]  the 60-day cut, start flushing around day 50. If this is your first time with a cut
[07:08.160 --> 07:12.880]  that you think may go 70 days, start flushing it around day 60. Now, when you
[07:12.880 --> 07:16.920]  get to day 60 or day 70 on whichever plant you're running, you don't have to
[07:16.920 --> 07:20.240]  cut it down just because you've been flushing for 10 days. Start paying more
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.760]  attention to the trichomes. If they are not amber, don't cut it down. Keep
[07:24.760 --> 07:28.600]  flushing for a few more days. It's better to over flush than under flush.
[07:28.600 --> 07:31.120]  The only thing you're doing is not giving it nutrients. It may have gotten a
[07:31.120 --> 07:34.840]  little bigger. It may have gotten a little beefier. But we're just trying to
[07:34.840 --> 07:40.600]  figure out the plant for the first time. So that is how to determine when to
[07:40.600 --> 07:44.520]  begin flush if you don't know the cultivar that you're using. Maybe it's a
[07:44.520 --> 07:48.080]  brand new seed. Maybe it's a new clone. Maybe you're just new at growing and you
[07:48.080 --> 07:51.960]  don't know when to cut it. Allowing the plant 60 to 70 days to grow and then
[07:52.000 --> 07:56.000]  giving yourself extra time at the end is always your best bet with a new cut.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.480]  Alright, so I feel like I have established how to tell if the plant is
[08:00.480 --> 08:04.240]  ripe and ready to cut down and I feel like we have a good idea of when to
[08:04.240 --> 08:09.760]  start flushing. Let's actually talk about flushing our cannabis plants. I think
[08:09.760 --> 08:13.000]  flushing is super simple and it's something people could easily improve
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.480]  and they're really skipping that step and I'm not sure why because it's free.
[08:17.480 --> 08:23.120]  It's a really easy step to improve your cannabis and it is free. Maybe people
[08:23.120 --> 08:27.560]  simply don't understand the importance of flushing and why it's important. So
[08:27.560 --> 08:32.760]  let me tell you quickly why flushing matters. Just imagine you've been pouring
[08:32.760 --> 08:38.680]  salty nutrients into this plant for nine weeks of flower plus another three or
[08:38.680 --> 08:42.040]  four weeks of veg. You've just been filling it up with nutrients. You've been
[08:42.040 --> 08:45.520]  pouring whatever nutrient brand you're using. You've been pouring nitrogen. You've
[08:45.520 --> 08:48.320]  been pouring phosphorus. You've been pouring potassium and you've been
[08:48.320 --> 08:52.960]  pouring carbohydrates into these plants for the past 12 weeks. Now all of that
[08:52.960 --> 08:57.080]  stuff is built up inside of that plant. The plant is not using all of it. It's
[08:57.080 --> 09:00.760]  letting some of it go. It's turning some of it into a gas and transpiring some of
[09:00.760 --> 09:05.320]  it out but some of it is still in the plant. If those nutrients are left in the
[09:05.320 --> 09:10.200]  plant when we harvest, dry and cure that plant, we're going to taste it. The plants
[09:10.200 --> 09:15.280]  are going to taste like crap. If you feed too much cow mag too late in flower,
[09:15.280 --> 09:19.240]  you're going to taste it. If you feed your plants too much potassium silicate
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.080]  late in flower, you're going to taste it. Also the plants are not going to burn
[09:23.080 --> 09:26.680]  properly. When you dry and cure these buds, they're not gonna smoke. You're
[09:26.680 --> 09:29.720]  gonna grind it up in a grinder. You're gonna roll a joint and it's just gonna
[09:29.720 --> 09:33.040]  burn black and make a funky weird charcoal. That's because they're
[09:33.040 --> 09:37.440]  leftover nutrients that you did not flush out. We can get that stuff out of
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.880]  there by properly flushing the plants. You are mostly flushing the soil. You
[09:42.880 --> 09:46.240]  want to clean out the soil so there's nothing left in your medium. Whether
[09:46.240 --> 09:51.840]  it's soil, soilless mix, if you got peat, whatever you're working in, you're gonna
[09:51.840 --> 09:56.640]  want to flush that. If it's rock wool, if it's cocoa, you need to clean it out. Each
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.120]  thing is going to take a different amount of time to clean out but you want
[10:00.120 --> 10:04.000]  to clean that out so the roots don't have anything to eat. Then the plant will
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.120]  start starving itself and it will start showing as harvest fall colors and it
[10:08.120 --> 10:13.280]  will taste proper when you dry it, cure it, and smoke it. That's why flushing
[10:13.280 --> 10:16.200]  is important. You want to get all those excess nutrients out of there, all those
[10:16.200 --> 10:20.800]  excess salts. When you roll a joint and smoke it, you don't want it to turn into
[10:20.800 --> 10:25.800]  a little briquette. You want it to turn into a nice white fluffy ash and just
[10:25.800 --> 10:31.560]  flake away. That comes from a properly flushed plant. Then that also comes
[10:31.600 --> 10:35.640]  from a properly dried, cured, and trimmed plant but that comes in the future. Today
[10:35.640 --> 10:39.640]  we're focusing on flushing. That's why flushing is important. You want
[10:39.640 --> 10:42.800]  your herb to taste good, you want it to burn well, and you want it to leave a
[10:42.800 --> 10:49.440]  nice white clean soft ash with no weird chunks. Let's actually talk about
[10:49.440 --> 10:54.680]  flushing the plants. Flushing the plants is really easy. About 10 to 14 days
[10:54.680 --> 10:58.480]  before you plan on harvesting the plants, prepare the amount of water that you
[10:58.560 --> 11:02.320]  would normally water the garden with. If you've got 1,000 watt light, maybe you've
[11:02.320 --> 11:05.560]  got a 5 gallon bucket full of water. Get that amount of water ready.
[11:05.560 --> 11:10.360]  When you would normally put nutrients into the water, don't do that. Just don't
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.800]  put nutrients in there. Maybe if you're going to add anything, put some enzymes in
[11:14.800 --> 11:19.360]  there. If you're using an enzyme, that will help break down all the decaying
[11:19.360 --> 11:22.880]  roots and all the matter inside of the root zone and it will speed up the
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.240]  process of the flush. It will help speed everything up. Enzymes are pretty
[11:27.240 --> 11:30.800]  much the only thing I would put in there other than maybe a little bit of
[11:30.800 --> 11:35.680]  shine. Maybe 1 to 2 grams of shine from veg bloom, but you really don't need it.
[11:35.680 --> 11:39.360]  Mostly all you would need is some enzymes for the last couple of days. If
[11:39.360 --> 11:44.700]  you're gonna flush for 14 days, maybe go for like 4 to 7 days, add 2 grams of
[11:44.700 --> 11:48.480]  shine and add some enzymes, but then cut out the shine and just keep the enzymes
[11:48.480 --> 11:52.240]  going until the end of the process. So the only thing you would put in there
[11:52.240 --> 11:56.760]  are enzymes and possibly some shine, but you would be probably just fine with
[11:56.800 --> 12:02.400]  nothing at all. So clean water, add the enzymes if you're gonna do so. For 4 to
[12:02.400 --> 12:07.560]  7 days, add the shine if you'd like to do so. Then adjust the pH to somewhere
[12:07.560 --> 12:11.800]  between 6.3 and 6.5. You'll be just fine. 6.3 and 6.5, that's a good window to
[12:11.800 --> 12:17.340]  adjust it to. Then simply water the plant with that minimal solution. All you've
[12:17.340 --> 12:20.920]  got to do is pour that right into the plants just like you normally do when
[12:20.920 --> 12:25.480]  you water. Soak the plants and let it run through. Now what you're doing, pouring
[12:25.480 --> 12:30.120]  the enzymes in there is going to help the natural decaying process happen
[12:30.120 --> 12:33.440]  inside that root zone. There's dead things in there. The roots that are dying
[12:33.440 --> 12:36.920]  are dying in there. The enzymes are gonna eat that and they're gonna speed up that
[12:36.920 --> 12:41.240]  process. Also that shine is going to keep adding density and trichomes and
[12:41.240 --> 12:45.000]  essential oils to your plants if you choose to add the shine. You still need
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.160]  to flush for the last week without the shine you guys, so make sure you cut that
[12:48.160 --> 12:51.480]  out. You can leave the enzymes in there if you'd like to at the end, but cut out
[12:51.480 --> 12:55.680]  that shine for the last week. Now you're probably at day 50, right? If we're gonna
[12:55.680 --> 12:59.720]  cut down at day 60, we're at day 50. We just mixed up a bunch of water and we
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.760]  just soaked that root zone. So now you've got pH water with enzymes and possibly
[13:04.760 --> 13:08.080]  some shine running through there. Those plants are gonna start looking for
[13:08.080 --> 13:11.160]  phosphorus and potassium and molybdenum and all the other things that they want.
[13:11.160 --> 13:14.520]  There's 16 minerals that the plants really want. You guys start thinking
[13:14.520 --> 13:17.280]  about that and learn all 16 of them. It will really help you think about what
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.600]  you're feeding your plant. Maybe we'll talk about that in the future, but the
[13:20.600 --> 13:23.240]  plant's gonna start looking for that stuff and all it's gonna find are
[13:23.240 --> 13:27.080]  enzymes and shine. It's gonna be like, well I've got essential oils, I'm gonna
[13:27.080 --> 13:30.600]  go beef up my trichomes and it's got stuff to build trichomes, but it doesn't
[13:30.600 --> 13:34.440]  have the building blocks to grow more plant material. It doesn't have all the
[13:34.440 --> 13:38.560]  nutrition that it needs to keep building bigger buds and fatter stems and going.
[13:38.560 --> 13:42.640]  So it's gonna start showing you its fall colors. It's gonna start turning into
[13:42.640 --> 13:46.200]  these yellow golden colors. You may get some reds, you may get some purples, you'll
[13:46.200 --> 13:50.200]  get some unique oranges. I really like taking pictures of my plants right
[13:50.200 --> 13:53.360]  at the flush phase because they really start showing great colors. The buds are
[13:53.360 --> 13:56.960]  nice and fat, the trichomes are all greasy and shiny, and then the leaves
[13:56.960 --> 14:01.400]  start getting these cool golden tones to them. But that's when you know that the
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.320]  flush is working. There are no nutrients left in that soil for the plant to eat
[14:05.320 --> 14:09.400]  and it is getting hungry, which is a good thing because now you know that bud is
[14:09.400 --> 14:13.120]  gonna burn smoothly. It's not gonna have nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium,
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.160]  molybdenum, iron, calcium, magnesium. It's not gonna have all this other funky shit
[14:18.160 --> 14:21.800]  in it that we don't want to smoke. It's just gonna be nice and clean. It'll burn
[14:21.800 --> 14:25.960]  nice and smoothly and it will taste really good. So you're gonna start seeing
[14:25.960 --> 14:33.200]  these fall colors come on. That timing is going to depend on your medium, how much
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.360]  nutrients you have been putting into the plant. It's gonna be very strain
[14:37.360 --> 14:42.040]  specific and also temperatures are going to have a huge effect on this. If it's a
[14:42.040 --> 14:46.080]  little cooler in the room, your plants are gonna turn a little more fall colors.
[14:46.120 --> 14:48.880]  If you have a lower nighttime temperature, you'll see a little more
[14:48.880 --> 14:52.760]  purple from the buds. You'll get a little more fall activity from the
[14:52.760 --> 14:57.600]  plants like what happened in nature. So you're gonna mix up the solution, you're
[14:57.600 --> 15:01.320]  gonna pH it, you're gonna water in the plant, it's gonna run out of the bottom.
[15:01.320 --> 15:06.680]  Then depending on your container size and the vapor pressure deficit in the
[15:06.680 --> 15:12.160]  room, you are going to have to water again. Repeat the process you guys. Mix up
[15:12.160 --> 15:16.960]  your container, put the enzymes in there, put the shine in there, pH adjust it to
[15:16.960 --> 15:22.840]  6.3 to 6.5 and water it right through the plants. Repeat this process right up
[15:22.840 --> 15:27.040]  to a week before harvest and then do the same thing but simply take out the shine.
[15:27.040 --> 15:33.800]  Add the enzymes, adjust the pH and then feed it right through the plants. Now the
[15:33.800 --> 15:38.240]  enzymes are totally not necessary. The shine is totally not necessary. You can
[15:38.240 --> 15:42.040]  do all of this with plain water. If you're adding the enzymes and shine, you
[15:42.040 --> 15:47.000]  are going to have connoisseur quality cannabis. That's what I would do. I would
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.520]  do the shine up to the last week, then after that I would just do the enzymes
[15:50.520 --> 15:53.680]  and then I'd probably do just two or three days of plain water just to give
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.000]  them time to finish up there. If I was going that 60 days, I would end up going
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.040]  63 and that last three days would just be plain water and micro is what would
[16:02.040 --> 16:07.200]  happen there. So just keep repeating the process. You want to rinse these plants
[16:07.200 --> 16:11.400]  out. You want to rinse the soil out as many times as you can between the start
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.920]  of flush and harvest. So if you can get it to dry up and rewater it every other
[16:15.920 --> 16:19.920]  day, that's great. If it takes three or four days, that's fine. You're still
[16:19.920 --> 16:23.800]  going to get, if you do it 12 days, you'll get three waterings in there if
[16:23.800 --> 16:27.200]  you go every four days. But if you're taking that much time to water, that
[16:27.200 --> 16:30.680]  means you've got a large container or that much time between waterings means
[16:30.680 --> 16:33.720]  you've got a large container, which means you're using quite a bit of water to
[16:33.720 --> 16:38.200]  flush that out, which means you need to make sure to get at least like 10 to 30
[16:38.200 --> 16:41.720]  percent runoff water. So if you've got like a 10 gallon pot, you're going to
[16:41.720 --> 16:45.240]  want to get at least one to two gallons of runoff coming out of that. That's how
[16:45.240 --> 16:48.720]  you know you're flushing well. So get plenty of water coming out and then
[16:48.720 --> 16:52.320]  flush the shit out of those plants. Do it as many times as you can, but be
[16:52.320 --> 16:57.280]  careful not to drown the plant. Don't try to sneak in another flush time just to
[16:57.280 --> 17:00.880]  get more water in there because that may do more harm than good. That may, you may
[17:00.880 --> 17:03.840]  kill the fucking plant right there. You may just drown it. You may suffocate it.
[17:03.840 --> 17:07.880]  That may be the end. You may be cut down early. So don't ruin it right at the end.
[17:07.880 --> 17:11.320]  Be careful. Just stay on your normal watering schedule. Just make sure you
[17:11.320 --> 17:15.320]  soak the shit out of it. Let it dry out. Water it again. Do that as many times as
[17:15.320 --> 17:19.960]  you can in the last 10 to 14 days. And if you want to add the enzymes, do that. If
[17:19.960 --> 17:23.360]  you want to use Shine, do that. Those are the only things I would really add at
[17:23.360 --> 17:29.200]  the end. So we have determined how to tell if the plants are ripe. We have
[17:29.200 --> 17:33.600]  determined a good time to start flushing. We know what to put in the water to
[17:33.600 --> 17:38.080]  flush the plants. We know why we're flushing. We know how to flush. You
[17:38.080 --> 17:42.200]  basically don't mix anything up and you run that through the plants. This will
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.360]  clean out the soil. That is our main goal. As that's happening, we're gonna see
[17:46.360 --> 17:49.680]  colors changing. We're gonna see trichomes ripening. We're gonna see
[17:49.680 --> 17:54.200]  plants finishing up. Now you're gonna get a bunch of funky, you may. I'm not
[17:54.200 --> 17:57.120]  promising. It depends on your genetics, your environment. It depends on a lot of
[17:57.120 --> 18:02.000]  things. You're going to get funky yellow leaves. You're gonna get dead foliage.
[18:02.080 --> 18:06.640]  Pull that stuff off. There's no problem with just yanking that dead stuff off.
[18:06.640 --> 18:09.720]  Make sure you throw it away. Get it out of the grow room. But just pull all that
[18:09.720 --> 18:14.840]  dead stuff off and throw it away. Now about a week, maybe five or three days
[18:14.840 --> 18:18.400]  before you harvest, go in the grow room and just start stripping off all the big
[18:18.400 --> 18:22.360]  leaves. This is going to save you a lot of time when it does come time to
[18:22.360 --> 18:26.280]  harvest. There won't be all these big giant leaves in your way. Just cut them
[18:26.280 --> 18:29.400]  off while the plant is standing up, while they're still stiff, while they're still
[18:29.400 --> 18:32.560]  alive. You can just snap them right off. Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop. You can go really fast.
[18:32.560 --> 18:35.640]  You don't even need scissors for it. Once you get the thumb technique of just
[18:35.640 --> 18:38.840]  popping a leaf off, you can just go in there and defoliate a whole section
[18:38.840 --> 18:43.600]  really quickly. So a few days before harvest, go in there and pull off all
[18:43.600 --> 18:47.560]  those big leaves. And that will save you a big headache and a bunch of time when
[18:47.560 --> 18:51.360]  it comes time to harvest the plants. You hang them upside down, dry them and cure them.
[18:51.360 --> 18:54.760]  When it comes time to trim, half the leaves are already gone. It will save you a
[18:54.760 --> 18:59.120]  lot of bullshit and a lot of trouble. So when you see them starting to get funky,
[18:59.160 --> 19:03.840]  take off the dead ones. Then, just a few days before harvest, probably when you
[19:03.840 --> 19:08.520]  cut out the shine maybe, then go in there and start pulling off the leaves.
[19:08.520 --> 19:11.640]  Now another thing you might want to do is you might want to reduce the temperature
[19:11.640 --> 19:17.320]  just a few degrees. Do not create a large swing in temps between your day and
[19:17.320 --> 19:24.160]  night. Do not go too cold at night. Do not try to create something drastic. If you
[19:24.160 --> 19:27.720]  can bring it down two or three degrees during the day and two or three degrees
[19:27.720 --> 19:32.080]  during the night, do that. But don't go crazy you guys. Don't shock the plants
[19:32.080 --> 19:35.640]  right at the end. Don't give yourself powdery mildew right at the end. Just try
[19:35.640 --> 19:38.760]  to mimic nature and get a little bit colder right at the end. Because what
[19:38.760 --> 19:42.120]  happens right at the end of the season, it gets cold. That's how things know, oh
[19:42.120 --> 19:45.600]  shit, it's wintertime and those plants will hurry up and finish. So you'll see
[19:45.600 --> 19:49.480]  more color, you may get a little more density and cool temps are good for
[19:49.480 --> 19:54.320]  terpenes. So lower the temperatures a little bit right at the end. Now one
[19:54.320 --> 19:58.080]  thing I'm sure people are going to send me messages about and ask is do I use
[19:58.080 --> 20:02.920]  any flushing agents? No. I do not use a flushing agent. I think all of the
[20:02.920 --> 20:07.840]  flushing agents are kind of a sales tactic. They are not necessary and I
[20:07.840 --> 20:12.480]  think they make your herb taste like whatever they taste like. It's the very
[20:12.480 --> 20:16.600]  end. Why would I want to put in a new ingredient? I want to get everything out.
[20:16.600 --> 20:21.040]  So I do not use a flushing agent. If I were to use anything, I would just use
[20:21.080 --> 20:25.240]  the solution I told you, the enzymes and the shine, and then I would add
[20:25.240 --> 20:29.200]  powdered coconut water. It would be the only flushing solution that I would use.
[20:29.200 --> 20:32.920]  A lot of people are saying, what? Yeah, coconut water would be ideal but that
[20:32.920 --> 20:36.440]  would get very expensive to buy it, have that much coconut water. Imagine trying
[20:36.440 --> 20:41.120]  to get a five gallon bucket of coconut water shipped to your house every three
[20:41.120 --> 20:45.680]  days for 14 days. That's going to add up. It's going to get real expensive. But you
[20:45.680 --> 20:50.040]  can buy powdered coconut water. It is readily available from a lot of
[20:50.040 --> 20:53.880]  grow stores. Build-A-Soil can take good care of you. They do not sponsor the
[20:53.880 --> 20:57.520]  show or anything but I know that that's a reliable source for powdered coconut
[20:57.520 --> 21:02.600]  water. Also something I should mention, a lot of people are growing no-till. A lot
[21:02.600 --> 21:09.360]  of people are growing in living soil or super soil or some sort of live soil. You
[21:09.360 --> 21:13.940]  guys, if that is what you're working with, you probably do not need to flush because
[21:13.940 --> 21:18.200]  you have created the perfect environment inside your plants rhizosphere to where
[21:18.200 --> 21:21.520]  it's taking up what it needs. You're not feeding it bottled nutrients. It's not
[21:21.520 --> 21:25.600]  being force-fed shit so it doesn't need to be flushed anything. Our buddy Subcool,
[21:25.600 --> 21:28.920]  when he would mix up a batch of super soil and put a plant in there, he would
[21:28.920 --> 21:32.000]  just feed it water for the whole flowering phase and he would say, I've
[21:32.000 --> 21:37.520]  been flushing the entire time. So before people start sending me emails, yes, there
[21:37.520 --> 21:40.960]  are some situations where you may not need to flush. If you are going no-till,
[21:40.960 --> 21:45.640]  if you're going all organic, flushing is not a thing. Now, if you're running that,
[21:45.640 --> 21:49.080]  you're already up to speed and you know that we don't need to teach you about
[21:49.080 --> 21:53.640]  flushing. You were in the advanced black belt class already. Now, I've got one more
[21:53.640 --> 21:56.920]  thing I should mention before I wrap up this so-called quickie episode that's
[21:56.920 --> 22:00.200]  going on for 20 minutes. You guys are very welcome. Thank you for listening. A
[22:00.200 --> 22:07.600]  good thing to do is to measure the EC or the PPMs of your runoff water. You were
[22:07.600 --> 22:11.080]  pouring a bunch of water into your plants, right? Collect it. Collect the
[22:11.080 --> 22:13.720]  water that comes out of the bottom of your plant into some sort of a vessel.
[22:13.720 --> 22:19.840]  Put your pH pen in there. Put your EC or PPM pen in there and see what the EC is.
[22:19.840 --> 22:23.640]  Now, if you're in a soil or a soil-less mix, you're only going to get down so low.
[22:23.640 --> 22:28.320]  If you're in cocoa, you can get those PPMs down really, really low. See how low
[22:28.320 --> 22:33.480]  you can get it. Maybe before you start flushing, that day, the first day you
[22:33.480 --> 22:37.320]  flush, measure what comes out. Then measure each time and see how low you
[22:37.320 --> 22:40.320]  can get it and then just keep experimenting. See how low it goes every
[22:40.320 --> 22:43.800]  day and see how low you can get the PPMs. I don't want to give any
[22:43.800 --> 22:47.120]  recommendations on how low to try and get it because it's going to vary based
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.560]  on your medium and I don't want to fuck up your grow. You're going to have to
[22:50.560 --> 22:53.880]  learn this based on your grow. Cocoa, you'll get it really low because cocoa
[22:53.880 --> 22:57.720]  is inert. Cocoa is not going to hold shit. Same thing with rockwool. You'll be
[22:57.720 --> 23:01.440]  able to get the PPMs of your rockwool and your cocoa down to amazingly low
[23:01.440 --> 23:05.240]  levels. Soil, soil-less mixes, those are still going to have some high PPMs
[23:05.240 --> 23:09.240]  because they are soil and soil-less mixes. There's just a lot of shit in
[23:09.240 --> 23:13.000]  there. But play with your runoff, pay attention to that, see how low you can
[23:13.000 --> 23:16.200]  get it and it'll be a lot of fun. It'll be a fun experiment and then you'll
[23:16.200 --> 23:20.000]  actually see what's going in and what's coming out of your plant. Maybe we should
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.560]  just talk about measuring runoff anyway in a full episode. We'll talk about
[23:23.560 --> 23:27.400]  checking the EC or the PPMs of a solution before you pour it into your
[23:27.400 --> 23:32.240]  plants and then we'll remeasure that same solution, the EC or the PPMs, when
[23:32.240 --> 23:35.400]  it comes out of the bottom of your plants and we'll compare that to the pH
[23:35.400 --> 23:39.120]  going in and the pH coming out and we'll see what's happening in your rhizosphere.
[23:39.480 --> 23:43.920]  Anyway, that's a future episode. I'm just getting excited. You guys, measure the
[23:43.920 --> 23:47.560]  electrical conductivity or the particles per million of what's coming out of your
[23:47.560 --> 23:51.480]  plant and you will know if you need to flush more or not. And then when you cut
[23:51.480 --> 23:55.320]  it down, write down the PPMs and then pay attention. And then if you are satisfied,
[23:55.320 --> 23:58.720]  hit that number next time. And if you're not satisfied, maybe flush a little
[23:58.720 --> 24:02.480]  longer and try to go lower. But don't be discouraged because it's not all about
[24:02.480 --> 24:06.080]  the flush. You still have dry and cure to fuck this up. You could ruin your whole
[24:06.120 --> 24:09.840]  crop after you cut it down. So ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for
[24:09.840 --> 24:14.720]  listening to my flushing episode. So far we have done determining ripeness,
[24:14.720 --> 24:19.240]  determining when to flush. We've talked about flushing. I think the next episode
[24:19.240 --> 24:24.520]  in line is harvesting and then after that we're going to do the dry and cure
[24:24.520 --> 24:27.280]  episode. There will be some interruptions to that schedule because I've got an
[24:27.280 --> 24:31.280]  episode scheduled with some friends and things always pop up, but those are on
[24:31.280 --> 24:35.040]  the chart to come up in order. Ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate you for
[24:35.040 --> 24:38.720]  listening to my podcast. Thanks for letting me ramble for so long. If you
[24:38.720 --> 24:42.120]  felt like this podcast was educational and you learned something and you would

[25:19.280 --> 25:23.320]  my website. It costs a little bit of money to do that every year. Also, I
[25:23.320 --> 25:27.440]  purchased a better Mac book so that I could record more efficiently. My old
[25:27.560 --> 25:31.480]  computer was not efficient is the polite way to say it, but the contributions will
[25:31.480 --> 25:34.400]  help to go pay for the Mac book that I bought and also cover the cost of the
[25:34.400 --> 25:37.760]  website. Also, if you may have heard Mike mentioned that the little microphone
[25:37.760 --> 25:42.560]  cover needed replacement, I use the funding for things like that. So if you'd
[25:42.560 --> 25:45.760]  like to contribute, I would appreciate it. I will quit begging because that got
[25:45.840 --> 25:49.240]  uncomfortable quite quickly. Ladies and gentlemen, I would love it if you would
[25:49.240 --> 25:52.320]  stalk me on all of the social media that is free. All you got to do is click
[25:52.320 --> 25:55.120]  around. Find me on Facebook. Simply search for the grow from your heart
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.400]  podcast. You can find me on Twitter. It's at GFYH podcast. You can find my
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.440]  personal account if you're interested in trolling me. I'm a rostagef420 on
[26:03.440 --> 26:08.040]  Twitter. Also, you should check me out on Instagram. I'm iree underscore
[26:08.040 --> 26:12.440]  genetics on Instagram. I like to do live feeds where I go on Instagram live and I
[26:12.440 --> 26:16.040]  hang out and take a couple of dabs and then I take questions from the Instagram
[26:16.040 --> 26:19.520]  live feed and I will rant about your question and teach you how to grow
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.120]  cannabis right there on the spot. I think it's fun because there's no notes.
[26:23.120 --> 26:26.880]  There's no preparation. Today, somebody asked me a fairly in-depth question and
[26:26.880 --> 26:29.920]  I had to stare into the sky and roll my eyes for about two minutes and try to
[26:30.280 --> 26:34.320]  word out the reply I was trying to give them because I wasn't prepared and it's
[26:34.320 --> 26:37.560]  really a lot of fun for me. It's kind of like it's like a game of stump the
[26:37.560 --> 26:41.480]  grower or stump the breeder or something like that. And I really find it. It's
[26:41.480 --> 26:45.320]  good for my brain. It keeps my brain going. It keeps my growth knowledge on
[26:45.320 --> 26:48.280]  the tip of my tongue and it keeps my brain active. You guys know that I had a
[26:48.280 --> 26:51.880]  brain injury a few years ago, so I like to do things to keep my brain going the
[26:51.880 --> 26:56.760]  right direction. But anyway, I'm fucking ranting today. You guys who needs a
[26:56.760 --> 27:00.360]  quick episode, right? Find me on Instagram. I think you would enjoy my
[27:00.360 --> 27:04.000]  Instagram live videos. Also, why wouldn't you want to check out some dope ass
[27:04.000 --> 27:09.040]  cannabis photography? Go check it out. Also, you guys, one more thing. YouTube.
[27:09.040 --> 27:12.920]  I have got all of the videos up on YouTube. You can find every episode of
[27:12.920 --> 27:16.440]  the Grow From Your Heart podcast on YouTube. Now, hopefully we're able to get
[27:16.640 --> 27:19.760]  a larger audience. We can reach more people. We can teach more people how to
[27:19.760 --> 27:24.040]  grow better cannabis. We can dispel more myths. We can educate more people by
[27:24.040 --> 27:27.320]  having another platform. So make sure you support the YouTube channel. Go click
[27:27.320 --> 27:31.520]  subscribe. Go like some videos. Go leave some silly comments. I would appreciate
[27:31.560 --> 27:34.840]  the support because I think that's all I've got for you today. This was a super
[27:34.840 --> 27:38.040]  rambly episode. I want to thank you guys for hanging out with me. I want to thank
[27:38.040 --> 27:41.960]  you again for tolerating my raspy, crappy voice. I feel like I talked it right out.
[27:42.240 --> 27:44.960]  By the end of the episode, I finally sound pretty decent now that the show is
[27:44.960 --> 27:48.160]  over. So thanks for tolerating that at the start of the show. You guys, I'll be
[27:48.160 --> 27:51.400]  back Monday with a fresh new episode. I want to give a huge shout out to my
[27:51.400 --> 27:55.880]  friend Texan Toker. And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug
[27:55.880 --> 27:56.320]  for me.
