[00:00.000 --> 00:01.360]  Yo, what up podcast world?
[00:01.360 --> 00:05.520]  It's Rasta Jeff and it's Thursday, so that means it's time for another throwback Thursday
[00:05.520 --> 00:08.440]  episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:08.440 --> 00:11.980]  Before I get into the block of old episodes, let me make a quick disclaimer.
[00:11.980 --> 00:16.520]  If I mention any advertising, any promotions, any contests, or any giveaways, those have
[00:16.520 --> 00:17.520]  all expired.
[00:17.520 --> 00:22.360]  There are currently no contests, no promotions, no advertising, or no giveaways.
[00:22.360 --> 00:24.880]  Also, let me update all of the social media.
[00:24.880 --> 00:29.960]  If you want to find me on Twitter, you can find me at GFYH Podcast on Twitter, on Facebook,
[00:29.960 --> 00:32.240]  simply search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[00:36.760 --> 00:39.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you enjoy these chunks of old episodes.
[00:39.720 --> 00:44.120]  Here we go with the throwback Thursday episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:44.120 --> 01:02.480]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[01:02.480 --> 01:06.080]  It's time for episode number 76 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:06.080 --> 01:08.800]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[01:08.800 --> 01:09.800]  That's right.
[01:09.800 --> 01:13.200]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[01:13.200 --> 01:16.240]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or even someone who's just curious about the
[01:16.240 --> 01:19.880]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.
[01:19.880 --> 01:21.480]  I'm your host Rasta Jeff.
[01:21.480 --> 01:22.860]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:22.860 --> 01:25.920]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[01:25.920 --> 01:27.280]  me use their music on the show.
[01:27.280 --> 01:30.040]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[01:30.040 --> 01:33.520]  Of course, the song you're listening to is the Doggy Dub and it's off their album, The
[01:33.520 --> 01:34.520]  Constant Struggle.
[01:34.520 --> 01:38.640]  Make sure you check that out and support the Mystic Roots Band and stay positive sound.
[01:38.640 --> 01:39.640]  All right, guys.
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.140]  I'll let you know that while I'm recording the podcast today, I am live on a new application
[01:44.140 --> 01:46.160]  called Periscope.
[01:46.160 --> 01:47.800]  People on Periscope are watching me live.
[01:47.800 --> 01:49.640]  I've got five live viewers.
[01:49.640 --> 01:50.640]  I'm recording.
[01:50.640 --> 01:51.640]  They can hear everything I'm saying.
[01:51.640 --> 01:55.280]  They could not hear the theme song, but they could hear everything else.
[01:55.280 --> 01:59.520]  They're able to send comments that I can see on the bottom of the screen.
[01:59.520 --> 02:02.920]  I'm not going to pay attention to the comments on Periscope while I record the podcast today,
[02:02.920 --> 02:09.180]  but if this goes well in a future episode, this may open up the doors for a questions
[02:09.180 --> 02:11.120]  and answers segment.
[02:11.120 --> 02:12.360]  You'll be able to answer questions.
[02:12.360 --> 02:16.120]  I will answer them live on Periscope as I record the podcast.
[02:16.120 --> 02:19.080]  And then in the future, it won't be any more than I'll do it.
[02:19.080 --> 02:20.760]  I'll try to get it up as quickly as possible.
[02:20.760 --> 02:24.960]  Right after the live Q&A, I'll go ahead and throw the podcast up into iTunes and Stitcher,
[02:24.960 --> 02:29.800]  and then you guys can listen to it again if you didn't already, if you listened to it
[02:29.800 --> 02:32.400]  on the fucking Periscope app.
[02:32.400 --> 02:35.120]  And if you didn't already listen to it, then you'll be able to hear the actual episode
[02:35.120 --> 02:37.760]  with questions from the listeners.
[02:37.760 --> 02:39.040]  So we're going to figure out how to do that.
[02:39.040 --> 02:40.400]  You guys check out this Periscope app.
[02:40.400 --> 02:42.120]  It's pretty neat.
[02:42.120 --> 02:47.680]  You can log in and you can watch people broadcast their lives, or you can broadcast your life
[02:47.680 --> 02:48.680]  if you'd feel like it.
[02:48.680 --> 02:49.680]  It's kind of neat.
[02:49.680 --> 02:52.680]  I've been going in the grow room and walking around in the garden and showing people what
[02:52.680 --> 02:54.880]  I've got going on in the garden.
[02:54.880 --> 02:58.560]  I've been driving around and throwing the phone up on the dashboard just while I drive
[02:58.560 --> 02:59.560]  around.
[02:59.560 --> 03:01.280]  It's been pretty neat.
[03:01.280 --> 03:02.280]  So let's move on a little bit.
[03:03.160 --> 03:07.520]  So in this show, you guys, I do plan on talking about pheno hunting and selecting mother plants.
[03:07.520 --> 03:09.520]  I know I've been teasing about pheno hunting a little bit.
[03:09.520 --> 03:12.240]  We're going to do that in this episode.
[03:12.240 --> 03:16.480]  Before we get that far though, I do want to send a big happy birthday shout out to Maya
[03:16.480 --> 03:17.480]  Luna.
[03:17.480 --> 03:18.480]  Happy birthday, monkey bear.
[03:18.480 --> 03:19.480]  That's my daughter.
[03:19.480 --> 03:20.680]  She is now 12 years old.
[03:20.680 --> 03:23.800]  This episode will come out on the 14th, late, late at night on the 14th.
[03:23.800 --> 03:26.080]  You guys will hopefully listen to it on the morning of the 15th.
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.400]  I'm going to drop it late on the 14th just to say happy birthday to my daughter.
[03:30.400 --> 03:31.400]  Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[03:31.520 --> 03:32.520]  I know your daddy loves you.
[03:32.520 --> 03:34.320]  I'm not sure if you listen to the podcast.
[03:34.320 --> 03:36.880]  I'm pretty sure you're tired of hearing my voice.
[03:36.880 --> 03:40.160]  So maybe one day when you're old and you listen back to all the episodes, you'll catch this
[03:40.160 --> 03:42.320]  one and it'll put a smile on your face.
[03:42.320 --> 03:44.320]  Dads think about that kind of shit.
[03:44.320 --> 03:45.320]  All right.
[03:45.320 --> 03:46.320]  So happy birthday, Maya bear.
[03:46.320 --> 03:48.160]  I love you so much more than anything.
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.160]  Let's keep the show moving.
[03:49.160 --> 03:53.520]  Dude, a couple of nights ago, my good buddy Clint got me a ticket.
[03:53.520 --> 03:54.640]  I drove.
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.960]  We took along Clint's little brother, Chris, and then we met up with our good buddy, Joe,
[03:58.960 --> 04:00.960]  who will be on a future episode of the podcast.
[04:01.520 --> 04:02.520]  We've talked about that.
[04:02.520 --> 04:08.160]  But we went up to Denver to Comedy Works and we saw Joey Coco Diaz and that motherfucker
[04:08.160 --> 04:11.800]  blew the roof off of Comedy Works.
[04:11.800 --> 04:13.200]  That dude ripped it up.
[04:13.200 --> 04:16.240]  That's one of the best comedy shows I've seen in quite a while.
[04:16.240 --> 04:20.680]  I know I say that about every comedy show when I come on this show, but it was one of
[04:20.680 --> 04:22.680]  the best shows I've seen in quite a long time.
[04:22.680 --> 04:25.200]  It totally kicked ass.
[04:25.200 --> 04:29.640]  For the first six or seven minutes of the show, he came out and he told a joke, right?
[04:29.640 --> 04:31.560]  And he kept telling jokes, but he told it.
[04:31.560 --> 04:34.240]  It was like he hit me and then I would start laughing.
[04:34.240 --> 04:37.040]  And as soon as I felt like I was going to catch my breath, he'd hit me harder.
[04:37.040 --> 04:38.960]  So I'd laugh even harder and lose my breath.
[04:38.960 --> 04:41.640]  And every time I feel like I was coming around, he'd hit me.
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.200]  And I was starting to get a pleasant pain in my cheeks and stomach from laughing so
[04:46.200 --> 04:47.200]  hard.
[04:47.200 --> 04:51.120]  And then I got this weird headache toward the back of my head from laughing so fucking
[04:51.120 --> 04:52.120]  hard.
[04:52.120 --> 04:53.120]  I was like, Joey, stop for a minute, bro.
[04:53.120 --> 04:57.960]  I need a little bit of oxygen because I cannot breathe and I cannot keep up with this.
[04:57.960 --> 05:00.800]  I'm moving the periscope camera right now so that they can see me a little bit better.
[05:00.800 --> 05:04.520]  I think I've got everything I need on the screen.
[05:04.520 --> 05:09.120]  So Joey Coco Diaz is definitely one of my favorite comedians.
[05:09.120 --> 05:12.240]  Joe Rogan says he's the best comedian on the planet right now.
[05:12.240 --> 05:14.520]  I could almost agree with that if you're into that style.
[05:14.520 --> 05:16.320]  I can listen to Joey talk all day.
[05:16.320 --> 05:20.040]  I listen to his podcast, The Church of What's Happening Now, and it's fucking awesome.
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.680]  So big shout out to Joey Coco Diaz for putting on an amazing fucking comedy show at Comedy
[05:24.680 --> 05:26.520]  Works in downtown Denver.
[05:26.520 --> 05:30.280]  Also big shout out to Baker and the entire Comedy Works crew.
[05:30.280 --> 05:31.840]  Baker, I owe you one, bro.
[05:31.840 --> 05:34.720]  If you ever need anything, if you're ever in Pueblo, make sure you get in touch with
[05:34.720 --> 05:35.720]  me.
[05:35.720 --> 05:37.600]  I will hook you up with any help you need.
[05:37.600 --> 05:38.920]  Comedy Works, I love that club.
[05:38.920 --> 05:43.480]  I've said it once or seven times, the best fucking comedy club in Colorado, possibly
[05:43.480 --> 05:44.760]  the world.
[05:44.760 --> 05:48.680]  Also I want to send a huge shout out to Clint for the ticket and for being a hell of a good
[05:48.680 --> 05:50.240]  friend, dude.
[05:50.240 --> 05:53.760]  You're my homie forever and I appreciate it and I see what you do and you're a good friend,
[05:53.760 --> 05:54.760]  dude.
[05:54.760 --> 05:55.760]  I just want to throw that out there.
[05:56.000 --> 05:57.000]  Had a great time.
[05:57.000 --> 05:58.000]  I know you're always going to be my friend.
[05:58.000 --> 05:59.840]  I appreciate that shit.
[05:59.840 --> 06:02.960]  Also shout out to Joe and Chris.
[06:02.960 --> 06:05.120]  And we killed it as a group at that show.
[06:05.120 --> 06:06.120]  Nobody was a bitch.
[06:06.120 --> 06:08.640]  Nobody whined about anything.
[06:08.640 --> 06:09.920]  Joe met us up in Denver.
[06:09.920 --> 06:12.360]  Chris and Clint and I all rode up together.
[06:12.360 --> 06:14.020]  Nobody was a little whiny girl.
[06:14.020 --> 06:15.020]  We had so much fun.
[06:15.020 --> 06:16.120]  We had a successful dinner.
[06:16.120 --> 06:19.640]  We flirted with the beautiful waitress at the Mellow Mushroom.
[06:19.640 --> 06:20.840]  We kicked ass at the show.
[06:20.840 --> 06:22.200]  We all met Joey Diaz.
[06:22.200 --> 06:25.560]  We all had a nice little smoke out in the car before and after.
[06:26.360 --> 06:27.360]  It was such a great time.
[06:27.360 --> 06:28.360]  So shout out to the crew for kicking it.
[06:28.360 --> 06:29.360]  You guys are not painting the asses.
[06:29.360 --> 06:30.360]  You are professionals.
[06:30.360 --> 06:32.440]  You are grown men and I fucking love hanging out with you guys.
[06:32.440 --> 06:33.440]  Let's do it more often.
[06:33.440 --> 06:34.440]  All right.
[06:34.440 --> 06:38.280]  You guys were all invited on the podcast whenever you'd like to be.
[06:38.280 --> 06:39.680]  So I wrote a note and I lost it.
[06:39.680 --> 06:40.680]  Shit.
[06:40.680 --> 06:41.680]  I got to reach for a note.
[06:41.680 --> 06:42.680]  It's right over here.
[06:42.680 --> 06:45.080]  Hold on, you guys.
[06:45.080 --> 06:46.080]  Okay.
[06:46.080 --> 06:47.080]  I've got my note.
[06:47.080 --> 06:52.520]  I wrote down to give a shout out to a guy who calls himself Beast of Omaha.
[06:52.520 --> 06:54.880]  Big shout out to the Beast of Omaha.
[06:54.880 --> 06:56.960]  He follows me on Periscope and we were talking earlier.
[06:56.960 --> 06:58.600]  I told him that I do a podcast.
[06:58.600 --> 07:00.320]  He said he was going to check it out.
[07:00.320 --> 07:02.440]  This is the episode I did right after we spoke, bro.
[07:02.440 --> 07:03.440]  So I hope you were listening.
[07:03.440 --> 07:05.000]  I hope you check this out.
[07:05.000 --> 07:06.000]  All right.
[07:06.000 --> 07:07.400]  We're going to keep the show moving.
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.080]  We are going to get on to the main topic of the show.
[07:11.080 --> 07:16.200]  The main topic of the show, you guys, is going to be pheno hunting and selecting mother plants.
[07:16.200 --> 07:19.880]  I didn't take a lot of notes because I feel like I can pull that episode off without a
[07:19.880 --> 07:20.880]  lot of preparation.
[07:20.880 --> 07:22.720]  I mean, I've got all the preparation in my head.
[07:22.720 --> 07:24.440]  I've done this a thousand times.
[07:25.000 --> 07:27.360]  So I think I can pull it off.
[07:27.360 --> 07:28.360]  But let's see.
[07:28.360 --> 07:29.360]  I got one or two more things I want to talk about.
[07:29.360 --> 07:30.360]  Where are my notes?
[07:30.360 --> 07:31.360]  Here we are.
[07:31.360 --> 07:32.440]  I want to announce something.
[07:32.440 --> 07:34.400]  This one is going to be really, really cool.
[07:34.400 --> 07:38.880]  So a very long time ago, I was scrolling through Instagram.
[07:38.880 --> 07:40.120]  I'm sorry about the clearing of the throat.
[07:40.120 --> 07:41.120]  You guys know how that goes.
[07:41.120 --> 07:43.840]  I smoke dabs and drink caffeine and then the throat goes to shit.
[07:43.840 --> 07:49.120]  A long time ago, I was scrolling through Instagram and I came across an Instagram page of a lovely
[07:49.120 --> 07:51.640]  lady called Dude It's Damsel.
[07:51.640 --> 07:52.960]  And I've been following Damsel.
[07:52.960 --> 07:54.000]  She's a suicide girl.
[07:54.560 --> 07:55.560]  She's tattooed up.
[07:55.560 --> 07:56.800]  She's got dreadlocks and she's fucking beautiful.
[07:56.800 --> 07:58.320]  She's an amazing woman.
[07:58.320 --> 08:00.960]  I've been following Damsel on Instagram for quite a while.
[08:00.960 --> 08:06.520]  And then a good friend of mine, our friend Hunt, the Grimy Gatsby, introduced me to Damsel.
[08:06.520 --> 08:07.800]  And also my friend Julia.
[08:07.800 --> 08:09.240]  I got to give shouts to Julie.
[08:09.240 --> 08:10.240]  What's up, Jules?
[08:10.240 --> 08:11.240]  Miss you, boo.
[08:11.240 --> 08:14.960]  She is partly responsible for introducing me to Damsel.
[08:14.960 --> 08:17.120]  So I got introduced to Damsel.
[08:17.120 --> 08:19.160]  We've talked, we've spoken a few times.
[08:19.160 --> 08:25.680]  And I am proud to announce that I am working on a strain for Dude It's Damsel, the suicide
[08:25.680 --> 08:26.680]  girl.
[08:26.680 --> 08:30.360]  It will be a strain specifically selected for her.
[08:30.360 --> 08:32.200]  And this strain will represent Damsel.
[08:32.200 --> 08:34.120]  It will be colorful.
[08:34.120 --> 08:35.200]  It will be sexy.
[08:35.200 --> 08:37.120]  It will stand out from the crowd.
[08:37.120 --> 08:39.120]  It will be something you want to look at.
[08:39.120 --> 08:40.960]  It will smell beautiful.
[08:40.960 --> 08:42.240]  It will taste amazing.
[08:42.240 --> 08:47.940]  And her idea is that when she smokes it, she wants a nice giggly sativa head high.
[08:47.940 --> 08:49.540]  So I'm working on that strain.
[08:49.540 --> 08:52.180]  I've got several, the seeds are ready.
[08:52.180 --> 08:53.180]  Here's where I am.
[08:53.180 --> 08:54.740]  The seeds are ready.
[08:54.740 --> 09:00.100]  And I have several crosses that I think would make Damsel happy.
[09:00.100 --> 09:03.500]  But instead of just running one cross, I'm going to run three or four crosses that I've
[09:03.500 --> 09:04.500]  made.
[09:04.500 --> 09:10.580]  And we're going to see if one of those gives us a phenotype that Damsel completely loves.
[09:10.580 --> 09:15.780]  So that is a great segue to get into the main meat of this podcast.
[09:15.780 --> 09:21.140]  The main topic of this podcast is pheno hunting and selecting a mother plant for the future.
[09:21.140 --> 09:25.380]  We're definitely going to focus on pheno hunting because I've already gone about 10 minutes.
[09:25.380 --> 09:29.060]  So let me head over to Google here.
[09:29.060 --> 09:30.060]  Sorry about the microphone bumps.
[09:30.060 --> 09:31.540]  Let me head over to Google here.
[09:31.540 --> 09:33.260]  Shout out to Damsel.
[09:33.260 --> 09:36.460]  Also before I get too far, I want to give a huge shout out to Damsel.
[09:36.460 --> 09:40.980]  Make sure you guys follow at dudetsdamsel on Instagram and let her know that you support
[09:40.980 --> 09:42.820]  her new strain.
[09:42.820 --> 09:49.060]  Use the hashtag, hashtag Damselsdank, D-A-M-S-E-L-S-D-A-N-K, Damselsdank.
[09:49.060 --> 09:50.060]  I think I said that right.
[09:50.060 --> 09:51.060]  I'm high.
[09:51.060 --> 09:52.060]  Hashtag Damselsdank.
[09:52.060 --> 09:53.980]  Let her know that you follow iRegenetics.
[09:53.980 --> 09:55.540]  You listen to the podcast.
[09:55.540 --> 09:56.540]  Follow her on Instagram.
[09:56.540 --> 09:58.140]  She's beautiful.
[09:58.140 --> 09:59.140]  Support her.
[09:59.140 --> 10:00.340]  Watch the progress of the strain that we're working on.
[10:00.340 --> 10:03.340]  I'll start posting pictures soon.
[10:03.340 --> 10:11.180]  So shout out to Damsel for giving me the honor to grow a strain that will represent her forever.
[10:11.540 --> 10:14.220]  And also I want to send a big, huge shout out to my buddy Hunt.
[10:14.220 --> 10:18.260]  Hey Hunt, thanks for linking Damsel and I up together to get this project started.
[10:18.260 --> 10:21.260]  I'm sure this is going to work out great for everybody.
[10:21.260 --> 10:26.140]  Once this project is completed and Damsel has picked her favorite phenotypes or phenotype,
[10:26.140 --> 10:31.580]  the strain should be available for purchase in flower form at Green and Healthy Cannabis
[10:31.580 --> 10:36.100]  in Colorado Springs and also the Spot Dispensary in Pueblo West, Colorado.
[10:36.100 --> 10:40.740]  So that'll be a long time coming, but once it's available, we will let you guys know.
[10:41.340 --> 10:46.100]  So to get that far, I'm going to have to do a pheno hunt, which is actually the main topic
[10:46.100 --> 10:47.580]  of this show.
[10:47.580 --> 10:52.460]  Now, it feels like a good place to start would be to define the word phenotype.
[10:52.460 --> 10:58.980]  So I'm headed over to Google and Wikipedia says a phenotype is the set of observable
[10:58.980 --> 11:03.740]  characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with
[11:03.740 --> 11:05.560]  the environment.
[11:05.560 --> 11:09.300]  So kind of what that says is if we have a bunch of seeds and we grow them out and they
[11:09.300 --> 11:12.740]  are all the same genotype, which means they came from the same parents, they're the same
[11:12.740 --> 11:14.540]  batch of seeds.
[11:14.540 --> 11:19.860]  If we grow those out, we will see what is called phenotypical expressions, which means
[11:19.860 --> 11:23.380]  some of those plants are going to show characteristics of its mother.
[11:23.380 --> 11:26.140]  Some are going to show characteristics of its father.
[11:26.140 --> 11:30.140]  Some are going to show characteristics of grandparents that we didn't even see in the
[11:30.140 --> 11:31.420]  parent plants.
[11:31.420 --> 11:37.260]  And then some of them are going to show perfect traits of 50-50 combinations of each.
[11:37.260 --> 11:41.420]  And then we're going to see variations in between depending on which phenyl generation
[11:41.420 --> 11:43.100]  you're working with.
[11:43.100 --> 11:47.580]  So one way to kind of put that is if you have a brother or sister, you probably don't look
[11:47.580 --> 11:56.980]  exactly alike because you're from the same parents, but you are different phenotypes basically.
[11:56.980 --> 12:00.060]  Maybe your brother is a little taller than you or a little fatter than you or something.
[12:00.060 --> 12:04.460]  That's just phenotypical expression of the same genotype basically.
[12:04.460 --> 12:07.540]  Also when we're working with plants, when we're looking for phenotypes, the purpose
[12:07.540 --> 12:13.380]  of a pheno hunt is to find the plant that you want from that 10 pack of seeds.
[12:13.380 --> 12:15.540]  Now you have a couple of decisions to make.
[12:15.540 --> 12:20.940]  Do you want the plant that represents the one that's on the picture of the package of
[12:20.940 --> 12:22.820]  seeds, the one that you read about?
[12:22.820 --> 12:25.740]  Do you want the one that grows a little bit shorter for your grow room?
[12:25.740 --> 12:29.020]  Do you want the one that's a little more indica dominant, the one that's a little more sativa
[12:29.020 --> 12:30.100]  dominant?
[12:30.100 --> 12:33.180]  That's something to think about when you are starting a pheno hunt.
[12:33.180 --> 12:36.500]  The purpose of the pheno hunt is to run through...
[12:36.500 --> 12:38.820]  See I would recommend at least 10 seeds as a breeder.
[12:38.820 --> 12:42.820]  I do anywhere from 25 to 100 seeds of the same strain.
[12:42.820 --> 12:49.740]  So the ideal thing is to run as many of these seedlings as you can underneath the same conditions
[12:49.740 --> 12:54.220]  to find the one that you want that is the stellar keeper out of all of the plants that
[12:54.220 --> 12:55.700]  you're working with.
[12:55.700 --> 13:01.620]  A lot of times I see people purchase a package of seeds and they will run two of those seeds
[13:01.620 --> 13:06.500]  and then they'll say, hey look, I've got sour diesel or hey look, I've got super lemon
[13:06.500 --> 13:07.500]  haze.
[13:07.500 --> 13:12.660]  And you might have a decent super lemon haze, but you don't have that super phenotype because
[13:12.660 --> 13:14.300]  you haven't gone through and done the work.
[13:14.300 --> 13:18.580]  You haven't pheno hunted out the one that is stellar, that is worth keeping, that's
[13:18.580 --> 13:20.220]  going to blow everybody else's mind.
[13:20.220 --> 13:24.140]  So a pheno hunt is where you're going to find a lot of good shit.
[13:24.140 --> 13:26.580]  And you could have gotten that stellar keeper out of just a couple.
[13:26.580 --> 13:30.220]  But I mean, if you do a large pheno hunt, the chances of finding what you want and that
[13:30.220 --> 13:32.860]  stellar keeper just it's even better.
[13:32.860 --> 13:33.900]  All right.
[13:33.900 --> 13:37.500]  So let's talk about a couple of really popular phenotypes while we're on this subject before
[13:37.500 --> 13:43.020]  we get into me explaining how I do my typical pheno hunts.
[13:43.020 --> 13:45.700]  I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about jilly bean.
[13:45.700 --> 13:49.700]  There is a really popular phenotype of jilly bean known as the candy store phenotype.
[13:49.700 --> 13:55.060]  And there's also another phenotype known as the orange phenotype.
[13:55.060 --> 13:59.660]  The candy store phenotype smells like when you walk into the candy store in the mall,
[13:59.660 --> 14:04.060]  it's got that sweet, it's like those candy hearts you buy at Valentine's day.
[14:04.060 --> 14:08.060]  It all smells real sugary and sweet and it makes you want to eat candy.
[14:08.060 --> 14:09.820]  That's what the candy store phenotype smells like.
[14:09.820 --> 14:11.180]  That's of course why it's called candy store.
[14:11.180 --> 14:14.780]  The orange phenotype smells like a basket of fucking oranges.
[14:14.780 --> 14:15.780]  It's so delicious.
[14:15.780 --> 14:17.460]  And those are known phenotypes.
[14:17.460 --> 14:20.860]  So when you hear people talking about, yeah, I got the orange phenotype or I got the jilly
[14:20.860 --> 14:22.940]  pheno, that's what they're talking about.
[14:22.940 --> 14:28.660]  I breed a strain called heart of gold and there is the chunky girl phenotype, which just
[14:28.660 --> 14:30.500]  grows big fat phenos.
[14:30.500 --> 14:34.940]  And then there's the mean girl, which looks a little, she's real jagged and the way that
[14:34.940 --> 14:37.020]  her buds grow are real spiky and pointy.
[14:37.020 --> 14:40.060]  So I call her the mean girl just because she looks angry when she grows.
[14:40.060 --> 14:42.900]  It's a really great plant, but it looks ferocious.
[14:42.900 --> 14:44.980]  It's like an intimidating plant for some reason.
[14:44.980 --> 14:49.420]  And then there's also the other pheno, which is the non-desirable pheno.
[14:49.420 --> 14:50.860]  It's the one that's more golden goat leaning.
[14:50.860 --> 14:52.980]  I don't keep that pheno when I grow heart of gold.
[14:52.980 --> 14:58.160]  I'll toss that one out right away when I identify it, but that's more of an advanced thing.
[14:58.160 --> 15:02.000]  So when you hear us talking about, I've got the whatever pheno, that's what we're saying,
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.760]  that we grew out a pack of seeds and we found the pheno that was known, that's been talked
[15:06.760 --> 15:09.960]  about a lot or that the breeder told you to look for.
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.880]  I know that there are phenos of black cherry chem that I tell the guys, my friends, I'm
[15:14.880 --> 15:17.040]  like, if you see that, I wouldn't even keep that one.
[15:17.040 --> 15:18.280]  I would just get rid of that right away.
[15:18.280 --> 15:20.760]  I'm like, if you see this, that's kind of the one you want to keep.
[15:20.760 --> 15:24.840]  So if you're growing black cherry chem, the one that shows dark, dark purple right away,
[15:24.840 --> 15:27.920]  like a plum purple right away, I don't think that's a keeper.
[15:28.680 --> 15:33.040]  It grows little tiny popcorn balls of bright, dark, dark purple buds.
[15:33.040 --> 15:34.280]  And I don't find that to be a keeper.
[15:34.280 --> 15:35.920]  So as a pheno hunter, I know to throw that away.
[15:35.920 --> 15:38.320]  And I only know that because I've grown it out so many times.
[15:38.320 --> 15:42.200]  I feel like I'm drifting a little bit away from the topic, but it's all useful information
[15:42.200 --> 15:43.200]  here.
[15:43.200 --> 15:44.200]  All right.
[15:44.200 --> 15:48.440]  I should probably get into explaining a little bit how I do a pheno hunt or how I would recommend
[15:48.440 --> 15:52.680]  you doing a pheno hunt as a kind of a new grower without a lot of space and a lot of
[15:52.680 --> 15:55.400]  money to spend on seeds.
[15:55.400 --> 16:00.260]  So the way to do it, I would get a 10 pack of seeds or a 12 pack if you can get it.
[16:00.260 --> 16:01.260]  Some folks are selling 12s.
[16:01.260 --> 16:02.520]  Get about 10 seeds if you can.
[16:02.520 --> 16:03.520]  10 is enough.
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.200]  If you want to run a pheno hunt for yourself, 10 is enough seeds.
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.640]  I would get seeds from a reputable company, from a reputable vendor.
[16:10.640 --> 16:17.480]  I would recommend stuff like Gage Green Genetics, Laplano Labs, IREAD Genetics, of course.
[16:17.480 --> 16:20.360]  Sin City Seeds has shown me some great shit lately.
[16:20.360 --> 16:23.920]  The Sour Seed Company has a great lineup and a lot of great things to offer.
[16:23.920 --> 16:27.200]  A lot of great DNA Genetics is somebody who I would recommend.
[16:27.200 --> 16:30.400]  Rare Dankness is somebody who I would recommend.
[16:30.400 --> 16:31.400]  Crockett Family Farms.
[16:31.400 --> 16:32.960]  There are a lot of seed breeders out there.
[16:32.960 --> 16:36.120]  You guys try to do some research, get a reputable brand.
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.120]  Give yourself a chance.
[16:37.120 --> 16:39.740]  Get some good seeds and give yourself a chance.
[16:39.740 --> 16:43.760]  So get a good 10 pack of seeds, feminized or regulars, that's up to you.
[16:43.760 --> 16:48.560]  So what we're going to do, we're going to germinate all 10 seeds and we're going to
[16:48.560 --> 16:49.960]  treat them all the same.
[16:49.960 --> 16:54.560]  We're going to do everything exactly the same to all 10 of these seeds for almost all
[16:54.560 --> 16:57.460]  of their lives until kind of mid flower.
[16:57.460 --> 17:02.840]  If we see that they need more water or more nitrogen or more something in late flower,
[17:02.840 --> 17:06.960]  we'll make a note of that and then we will keep that in mind when we select our keepers
[17:06.960 --> 17:07.960]  in the future.
[17:07.960 --> 17:10.080]  So we're going to germinate 10 seeds.
[17:10.080 --> 17:14.880]  We're going to pay attention to them from day one because you just want to keep notes.
[17:14.880 --> 17:18.840]  If you've got a seed that's a straggler, make a note of one that's a straggler.
[17:18.840 --> 17:23.120]  If you can label your seeds somehow, like seed one, seed two, seed three, make a note
[17:23.120 --> 17:24.120]  of that.
[17:24.120 --> 17:27.560]  So germinate these seeds, get them into cups, grow them, take some pictures if you can,
[17:27.560 --> 17:29.680]  about once a week if you can.
[17:29.680 --> 17:33.200]  Then what we want to do is pay attention to them really closely, veg them out a little
[17:33.200 --> 17:34.200]  bit.
[17:34.200 --> 17:38.000]  Then you want to take a clone of them as soon as they're big enough to take clones.
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.600]  So now you've got these little plants that are probably in like one to three gallon pots
[17:41.600 --> 17:44.900]  and you've probably taken a couple of clones off of them hopefully, right?
[17:44.900 --> 17:47.020]  So now you've got a decision to make.
[17:47.020 --> 17:51.140]  Do you want to flower out the original seed that you started or do you want to keep that
[17:51.140 --> 17:55.440]  seedling as a mother plant or do you want to keep one of the clones as a mother and
[17:55.440 --> 17:58.940]  flower out that plant that's already large?
[17:58.940 --> 17:59.940]  It's kind of a toss up.
[17:59.940 --> 18:01.960]  It depends on how much space you have and what you want to do.
[18:01.960 --> 18:08.180]  What I have learned is I like that seeded, the seedling mother to stay as my mom.
[18:08.180 --> 18:10.100]  For some reason it has more vigor.
[18:10.100 --> 18:13.300]  It seems to be a good idea to keep that one as your mother.
[18:13.300 --> 18:15.860]  That's just my opinion.
[18:15.860 --> 18:18.380]  A lot of people say that that one's already grown and already big.
[18:18.380 --> 18:20.060]  Why not flower it out?
[18:20.060 --> 18:24.380]  Lately from watching clones grow and watching seed plants grow, I prefer to have my mother
[18:24.380 --> 18:25.760]  plant come from seed.
[18:25.760 --> 18:27.980]  That's something I have learned.
[18:27.980 --> 18:31.420]  I may be hypocritical because sometimes time doesn't always allow that.
[18:31.420 --> 18:33.420]  Sometimes I need the space in the room to bloom.
[18:33.420 --> 18:36.180]  So I bloom out the large plant that's already going.
[18:36.180 --> 18:41.580]  But from now on I will try to keep that seed plant as my original mother.
[18:41.580 --> 18:45.180]  So you got these plants, they're big enough to take a clone off of.
[18:45.180 --> 18:48.620]  You take a couple of clones and then you decide which one you want to flower.
[18:48.620 --> 18:52.460]  So if you're going to flower that original mom, you put all 10 of those original seed
[18:52.460 --> 18:57.920]  moms into a flowering room and you treat them all the exact same and you flower all of them.
[18:57.920 --> 19:01.580]  If you choose to do clones, all you have to do is get the clones into pots, get them rooted
[19:01.580 --> 19:04.820]  and everything, get them healthy, and then put those into the flowering room.
[19:04.820 --> 19:05.820]  That'll catch everything right up.
[19:05.820 --> 19:07.860]  We're on the same lesson now.
[19:07.860 --> 19:09.140]  So now you're in flower.
[19:09.140 --> 19:12.940]  Now's when you really have to start paying attention and taking good notes.
[19:12.940 --> 19:16.220]  If you've got males, you'll find out about day 10.
[19:16.220 --> 19:19.260]  Get those out of there unless you plan on breeding because those males are going to
[19:19.260 --> 19:20.620]  start dropping pollen.
[19:20.620 --> 19:22.580]  It'll start causing you problems.
[19:22.580 --> 19:23.860]  Get the males out of there about day 10.
[19:23.860 --> 19:25.460]  We talk about that a lot.
[19:25.460 --> 19:29.540]  If you're pheno hunting for males, that'll be a whole nother episode, you guys.
[19:29.540 --> 19:30.900]  I'm not even ready to do that.
[19:30.900 --> 19:34.660]  I'll write it down, but I'm not sure that that's going to happen for a long time.
[19:34.660 --> 19:37.980]  Pheno hunting males, that's going to be neat.
[19:37.980 --> 19:38.980]  That's a really advanced lesson.
[19:38.980 --> 19:42.020]  That'll be way up there in the way past episode 100.
[19:42.100 --> 19:43.660]  We'll talk about it maybe.
[19:43.660 --> 19:45.140]  So pull out the males.
[19:45.140 --> 19:48.860]  Now you want to take a lot of notes because around week three, week four is when you're
[19:48.860 --> 19:52.260]  going to start seeing a lot of different shit.
[19:52.260 --> 19:56.260]  If something herms, you're probably going to see that around between five and eight.
[19:56.260 --> 19:57.620]  Get rid of all of those.
[19:57.620 --> 19:59.740]  You don't want to keep the hermaphrodites.
[19:59.740 --> 20:04.220]  So if you've got a 10 pack, you're probably going to get somewhere between four and six
[20:04.220 --> 20:05.360]  boys out of there, right?
[20:05.360 --> 20:06.360]  If you've got regular seeds.
[20:06.360 --> 20:07.360]  So you pull those out.
[20:07.360 --> 20:09.340]  Now you've got like five more to deal with.
[20:09.340 --> 20:13.620]  If you've got fem seeds and probably you lost one during germ, you only got nine.
[20:13.620 --> 20:17.380]  So now you probably got four or five plants to work with, maybe six.
[20:17.380 --> 20:20.020]  If you're working with fems, you may still have 10 of them.
[20:20.020 --> 20:22.980]  A couple of them are going to be run team, a couple of them be squatty or whatever.
[20:22.980 --> 20:26.180]  It's okay to pull those squatty plants if they're shitty.
[20:26.180 --> 20:29.860]  If it's healthy and not looking like a run and a problem, keep it because when you run
[20:29.860 --> 20:33.420]  LA confidential, the shitty looking plant is the one you want to keep.
[20:33.420 --> 20:35.380]  Honestly, it's not the run.
[20:35.380 --> 20:36.380]  It's not crappy looking.
[20:36.380 --> 20:38.440]  It's the small, slow growing one.
[20:38.540 --> 20:40.620]  If your plant looks like a run, you can go ahead and get rid of it.
[20:40.620 --> 20:42.640]  So you want to watch them grow.
[20:42.640 --> 20:44.520]  Some are going to do stupid shit.
[20:44.520 --> 20:45.520]  Pay attention to what you like.
[20:45.520 --> 20:50.200]  The ones that fall over a lot, if one attracts bugs or one attracts mold, that's not the
[20:50.200 --> 20:51.800]  keeper.
[20:51.800 --> 20:53.880]  Watch for nanners, like I said, around week five or eight.
[20:53.880 --> 20:56.260]  If you get a hermaphrodite, get rid of that one.
[20:56.260 --> 21:00.280]  So take a lot of pictures, smell them, pay a lot of attention to how they grow.
[21:00.280 --> 21:03.680]  Then you're going to have to harvest all 10 of these plants or however many made it to
[21:03.680 --> 21:04.680]  the end.
[21:04.680 --> 21:05.680]  I said four to six, right?
[21:05.680 --> 21:10.800]  So harvest all four to six of these, trim them down, cure them properly.
[21:10.800 --> 21:14.080]  Listen to episode number 35 about drying and curing.
[21:14.080 --> 21:16.320]  Dry and cure your medicine properly.
[21:16.320 --> 21:21.280]  Once all of your finished plants are dried and cured, it's time to do a few smoke samples
[21:21.280 --> 21:23.600]  on every phenotype that you've grown.
[21:23.600 --> 21:27.960]  Now if you're growing it for just you, you can smoke it and you can decide which one
[21:27.960 --> 21:29.120]  you like for yourself.
[21:29.120 --> 21:32.280]  But if you're going to be selling it or giving it to medical patients or sharing it with
[21:32.280 --> 21:35.720]  your friends, it's a good idea to pass out a few buds of each one.
[21:35.720 --> 21:37.840]  I don't tell anybody which is which.
[21:37.840 --> 21:42.080]  I just label it A or B and I'm like, tell me which one you like better and tell me why.
[21:42.080 --> 21:44.200]  Then I send it off to a couple of my patients.
[21:44.200 --> 21:45.200]  My buddy Doug, what's up Doug?
[21:45.200 --> 21:46.600]  I hope you're listening.
[21:46.600 --> 21:49.920]  Every time I grow new plants, I don't label them.
[21:49.920 --> 21:50.920]  I remember what they are.
[21:50.920 --> 21:54.000]  I'll give them initials or a code word or something and I'll take it to Doug and I'll
[21:54.000 --> 21:56.560]  be like, smoke these, tell me which ones we need to keep and which ones we should get
[21:56.560 --> 21:57.560]  rid of.
[21:57.560 --> 22:02.240]  Since I'm his medical provider, his opinion is a big influence on what I keep.
[22:02.240 --> 22:07.560]  Then also White Mike that's on the podcast, Milky Tricomes, Nemo Punk 15, he does a lot
[22:07.560 --> 22:10.360]  of helping with my selection also.
[22:10.360 --> 22:13.280]  If you're the grower, it's a lot up to you.
[22:13.280 --> 22:14.880]  50% of it is up to the grow.
[22:14.880 --> 22:19.560]  If it grows like shit, if it grows 12 feet tall in eight weeks and you're indoors and
[22:19.560 --> 22:23.080]  you're under an eight foot ceiling, that's not the phenotype for you.
[22:23.080 --> 22:27.040]  If it grows 32 feet wide in six weeks and you're in a small room, that's not the phenotype
[22:27.040 --> 22:28.040]  for you.
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.160]  If it grows super completely lanky and falls over and needs a thousand stakes and you're
[22:32.160 --> 22:37.040]  trying to get one bud kind of scrog system, that might not be the one for you.
[22:37.040 --> 22:39.960]  Look for the one that grows the way that you want it to grow.
[22:39.960 --> 22:43.640]  Hopefully that comes out to be the one that smokes well also.
[22:43.640 --> 22:47.320]  Typically, this is what I found as a grower growing a 10 pack.
[22:47.320 --> 22:49.440]  You're going to end up with one that is fucking beautiful.
[22:49.440 --> 22:53.680]  You're going to end up with one that is covered in resin and has a lot of trichomes.
[22:53.680 --> 22:57.280]  Then you'll probably have one that tastes really, really good and you'll have one that
[22:57.280 --> 22:59.000]  harvests really, really heavy.
[22:59.000 --> 23:02.720]  But if you can find one that does all of those, then you're golden.
[23:02.720 --> 23:04.120]  That's the one that you want.
[23:04.120 --> 23:06.640]  But if you can get two or three of those, if you can get the good high and the good
[23:06.640 --> 23:08.120]  flavor, that's awesome.
[23:08.120 --> 23:09.960]  I would sacrifice that for weight.
[23:09.960 --> 23:13.960]  If you're a cash cropper, maybe you want to sacrifice the good flavor for the weight.
[23:13.960 --> 23:14.960]  Just think about what you want.
[23:14.960 --> 23:18.640]  If you can find a strain that does it all for you, find that, get clones of it and grow
[23:18.640 --> 23:19.640]  it forever.
[23:19.640 --> 23:24.060]  But a good pheno hunt, you have to take clones because if you don't take clones of everything
[23:24.060 --> 23:27.340]  you grow, you're going to end up having the best weed on the planet one time and not have
[23:27.340 --> 23:30.260]  a clone of it and be so pissed off at yourself.
[23:30.260 --> 23:33.100]  All right, guys, that's the basics of a pheno hunt.
[23:33.100 --> 23:37.420]  Basically keep in mind that not all seeds are going to yield the exact same plants.
[23:37.420 --> 23:40.100]  You might not get the plants that you saw in the package.
[23:40.100 --> 23:44.860]  You might not get the plants that were advertised, but your goal is actually to find the one
[23:44.860 --> 23:48.700]  that you love and keep that one around and turn it into a mother plant.
[23:48.700 --> 23:50.100]  We're going to talk about that in a second.
[23:50.100 --> 23:52.380]  But once you've got that one keeper, you know what you can do next?
[23:52.380 --> 23:56.140]  You got to do another pheno hunt of 10 more seeds and find another keeper.
[23:56.140 --> 23:59.380]  And if it's better than the other one that you've got, then toss out that other one or
[23:59.380 --> 24:00.860]  do it until your mother room is full.
[24:00.860 --> 24:04.740]  Just keep hunting for keeper plants and more keeper plants until you've got the most stellar
[24:04.740 --> 24:06.100]  fucking lineup of plants.
[24:06.100 --> 24:08.220]  All right, so let's talk about keeping a mother plant.
[24:08.220 --> 24:10.660]  Now you've grown this pheno hunt.
[24:10.660 --> 24:12.180]  You have found the plant that you like.
[24:12.180 --> 24:13.940]  You've got the one that has the flavor you like.
[24:13.940 --> 24:15.020]  It gives you the high you like.
[24:15.020 --> 24:16.860]  It grows well for your room.
[24:16.860 --> 24:20.820]  Now you've got, you either took a clone of it or you've got that remaining seed plant
[24:20.820 --> 24:22.700]  that you're going to use as a mother.
[24:22.700 --> 24:26.180]  So the trick to keeping that plant as your mother plant is to keep it under a vegetative
[24:26.180 --> 24:27.180]  light.
[24:27.180 --> 24:33.740]  I like to use a 19-5 cycle for my mother plants, 19 hours on, five hours off, because I feel
[24:33.740 --> 24:38.860]  like this gives my plants plenty of light to keep them from trying to auto flower.
[24:38.860 --> 24:44.500]  Some more tropical strains will try to auto flower if you let them go a little less light.
[24:44.500 --> 24:50.460]  So the 19-5, five hours to give them a little bit of sleep cycle and let my equipment rest.
[24:51.100 --> 24:52.100]  Every living thing likes to sleep.
[24:52.100 --> 24:54.900]  So I like to give my mother plants a little bit of sleep time.
[24:54.900 --> 24:59.780]  So you keep your mother plant on a vegetative cycle, a vegetative light cycle to keep it
[24:59.780 --> 25:00.780]  alive indefinitely.
[25:00.780 --> 25:06.260]  I would like to feed it some sort of like just a basic veg nutrient.
[25:06.260 --> 25:09.820]  Whatever you're feeding your veg plants, you can feed your mother plants that, just basic
[25:09.820 --> 25:11.980]  nitrogen, keep the roots happy.
[25:11.980 --> 25:15.220]  If you want to keep them for a long time, you're going to have to repot your mothers.
[25:15.220 --> 25:17.240]  They will get root bound.
[25:17.240 --> 25:21.960]  So what I do, my mother plants only last me about eight months to a year.
[25:21.960 --> 25:23.400]  I'll cut new mother plants.
[25:23.400 --> 25:24.600]  I'll cut a clone.
[25:24.600 --> 25:27.000]  I'll cut six or eight clones from my mother plant, right?
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.040]  And I will run four or five of those, but I'll keep one of them behind.
[25:31.040 --> 25:33.680]  It'll go into a cup, it'll go into a pot, and then I'll just put it into that mother
[25:33.680 --> 25:37.240]  room and replace the old mother plant because they start to get ran out.
[25:37.240 --> 25:39.540]  They start to get kind of lazy and shit.
[25:39.540 --> 25:41.600]  You take a bunch of cuts from it, you take clones from it.
[25:41.600 --> 25:42.880]  It's been sprayed for bugs.
[25:42.880 --> 25:45.120]  It's been manipulated under these lights for eight months.
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.140]  It starts to get kind of lazy.
[25:47.140 --> 25:50.940]  So I feel like it's a good idea to take a fresh cut from my mother plant, keep it under
[25:50.940 --> 25:55.820]  that 18 fucking, or that 19 five light indefinitely, and then just keep it alive.
[25:55.820 --> 26:00.020]  And then if you prune it, if you keep it free of bugs, if you keep it healthy, that mother
[26:00.020 --> 26:03.700]  plant will stick around and give you lots and lots of clones and keep that strain alive
[26:03.700 --> 26:05.240]  forever.
[26:05.240 --> 26:11.380]  So I think that wraps up pheno hunting, selecting a keeper and using that keeper as a mother
[26:11.380 --> 26:14.740]  all within, we got that down here in 25 minutes and 30 seconds.
[26:14.740 --> 26:16.100]  So I think that's going to work for you.
[26:16.420 --> 26:18.860]  Guys, I really appreciate you listening to the podcast.
[26:18.860 --> 26:23.540]  I recorded this in two sessions on a new app called Periscope.
[26:23.540 --> 26:27.180]  I do plan on possibly doing a podcast through Periscope.
[26:27.180 --> 26:28.740]  I will record as normal.
[26:28.740 --> 26:30.300]  I will also record on Periscope.
[26:30.300 --> 26:33.980]  If you're participating on Periscope, you will be able to ask me questions live on the
[26:33.980 --> 26:36.180]  show and I will answer them for you.
[26:36.180 --> 26:39.300]  You'll only be able to type in the text box, but I'll be able to read them, answer the
[26:39.300 --> 26:40.300]  questions.
[26:40.300 --> 26:41.700]  I'll be able to help out the listeners live on the show.
[26:41.700 --> 26:43.300]  It'll be a little bit more interactive.
[26:43.300 --> 26:45.820]  We're going to try it out once and see how it goes.
[26:46.540 --> 26:49.620]  I will try to announce when it's going to happen so that people can participate and
[26:49.620 --> 26:53.180]  then we can get people on and then we'll try to do regularly scheduled shows like that.
[26:53.180 --> 26:57.780]  Every four or five episodes will be a question episode, a live Q&A is what I'm aiming for.
[26:57.780 --> 26:59.660]  So guys, I really appreciate you listening to the show.
[26:59.660 --> 27:01.660]  Everybody on Periscope watching now, thanks for participating.
[27:01.660 --> 27:04.060]  I'm sorry, I've been ignoring the chat on Periscope.
[27:04.060 --> 27:06.500]  I'm more focused on the podcast.
[27:06.500 --> 27:09.140]  In the future, I will participate with you guys.
[27:09.140 --> 27:10.140]  Periscope is a new app.
[27:10.140 --> 27:11.140]  You guys check it out.
[27:11.140 --> 27:14.820]  I log in there, you turn on the camera and you talk and it turns you into basically your
[27:14.820 --> 27:15.820]  own reality show.
[27:15.820 --> 27:17.980]  You guys can watch from wherever you are on your phones.
[27:17.980 --> 27:19.740]  I watch other people's Periscopes also.
[27:19.740 --> 27:20.740]  It's pretty entertaining.
[27:20.740 --> 27:21.740]  Yeah, happy birthday, Mya Bear.
[27:21.740 --> 27:22.740]  I love you so much.
[27:22.740 --> 27:23.740]  Guys, thanks for listening to the podcast.
[27:23.740 --> 27:28.500]  I'll be back in another week with another episode.

[27:47.260 --> 27:48.260]  Check it out.
[27:48.260 --> 27:50.260]  I need a five-star rating because that moves us up in the ranks.

[27:53.820 --> 27:56.180]  The more people that see the show, the more people will listen to the show.
[27:56.180 --> 27:57.940]  The more people will grow better cannabis.
[27:57.940 --> 27:58.940]  The more better cannabis.
[27:58.940 --> 28:00.540]  I keep saying the more better cannabis.
[28:00.540 --> 28:02.340]  It's such a great fucking set of words.
[28:02.340 --> 28:06.340]  The more quality cannabis will be available for you to smoke will overgrow the government.
[28:06.340 --> 28:07.960]  There'll be good weed everywhere.
[28:07.960 --> 28:08.960]  More people will listen to the show.
[28:08.960 --> 28:09.960]  So give me five stars.
[28:09.960 --> 28:11.300]  Leave a little comment.
[28:11.300 --> 28:12.300]  Let me know what you think of the show.
[28:12.300 --> 28:14.620]  I will read your comments on a future episode.
[28:14.620 --> 28:17.860]  I would appreciate it if you leave a comment on Stitcher, but Stitcher kind of sucks for
[28:17.860 --> 28:18.860]  leaving comments.
[28:18.860 --> 28:20.740]  It's really hard to leave a comment that I will find.
[28:20.740 --> 28:23.980]  If you've got something to say and you want to make sure it gets to me, you can find me

[29:03.260 --> 29:04.260]  definitely appreciate it.
[29:04.260 --> 29:07.720]  All you got to do, click on there, type in whatever amount you want, and that will go
[29:07.720 --> 29:09.180]  directly to my PayPal account.
[29:09.180 --> 29:10.660]  I will buy a new microphone cover.
[29:10.660 --> 29:12.780]  I've been spitting into this one for quite a while.
[29:12.780 --> 29:16.500]  I would like to get a new mobile recording device so that maybe we can go to the Cannabis
[29:16.500 --> 29:19.940]  Cup, the Secret Cup, other places, and go do podcasts from there.
[29:19.940 --> 29:22.660]  Be a little bit easier than hauling around the big rig that I've got.
[29:22.660 --> 29:25.460]  Anyway, I'm not begging, but it would be appreciated.
[29:25.460 --> 29:27.560]  Do it if you'd like.
[29:27.560 --> 29:29.660]  Make sure you follow iRegenetics on Instagram.
[29:29.660 --> 29:31.980]  We're at almost 16,000 followers.
[29:31.980 --> 29:34.820]  I post a whole bunch of high-quality cannabis pictures up there.
[29:34.820 --> 29:36.900]  Make sure you follow that, you guys.
[29:36.900 --> 29:38.100]  Big shout out to my ninja spits.
[29:38.100 --> 29:39.420]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[29:39.420 --> 29:42.420]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[30:59.150 --> 31:00.150]  Welcome back, cannabis community.
[31:00.150 --> 31:04.150]  It's time for episode number 77 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[31:04.150 --> 31:07.150]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[31:07.150 --> 31:08.150]  That's right.
[31:08.150 --> 31:12.150]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a veteran
[31:12.150 --> 31:15.670]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[31:15.670 --> 31:19.150]  state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[31:19.150 --> 31:21.150]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[31:21.150 --> 31:23.150]  Today, today, sorry, that was a hard word.
[31:23.150 --> 31:25.150]  Today, I am joined by our good friend, White Mike.
[31:25.150 --> 31:26.150]  How are you doing today, bro?
[31:26.150 --> 31:27.150]  I'm doing good, man.
[31:27.150 --> 31:28.150]  How are you?
[31:28.150 --> 31:29.150]  I'm doing good if I can get through this intro.
[31:29.150 --> 31:30.150]  Right.
[31:30.150 --> 31:31.150]  The hardest word was today.
[31:31.150 --> 31:34.150]  I've said that word a lot, so there must be something going on in my brain.
[31:34.150 --> 31:36.150]  I think there's some dab on your tongue.
[31:36.150 --> 31:38.150]  There might be, yeah, my brain might be all sticky from the dabs.
[31:38.150 --> 31:39.150]  Today is a stony Sunday.
[31:39.150 --> 31:41.150]  We are recording on June 14th.
[31:41.150 --> 31:42.150]  Happy birthday, Maya Luna.
[31:42.150 --> 31:45.150]  This episode will come out on Thursday, June 18th.
[31:45.150 --> 31:48.150]  Before we get into a lot of stuff, I want to read an iTunes comment.
[31:48.150 --> 31:50.150]  We don't get a lot of iTunes comments on the show.
[31:50.150 --> 31:53.150]  Oh, I got to say thanks to Cat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band.
[31:53.150 --> 31:57.150]  The opening song is the doggy dub that is from the Mystic Roots Band off the album,
[31:57.150 --> 31:58.150]  The Constant Struggle.
[31:58.150 --> 32:01.150]  Make sure you support the Mystic Roots Band and stay positive sound.
[32:01.150 --> 32:02.150]  Check it out.
[32:02.150 --> 32:03.150]  We got a new iTunes comment.
[32:03.150 --> 32:06.150]  I always love it when we get iTunes comments.
[32:06.150 --> 32:07.150]  All right.
[32:07.150 --> 32:09.150]  This comment is from Adrian WSK, and it says,
[32:09.150 --> 32:11.150]  This podcast rocks.
[32:11.150 --> 32:12.150]  I look forward to Mondays because of it.
[32:12.150 --> 32:15.150]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[32:15.150 --> 32:16.150]  He gives us five stars.
[32:16.150 --> 32:17.150]  Nice.
[32:17.150 --> 32:18.150]  Thank you.
[32:18.150 --> 32:19.150]  Awesome.
[32:19.150 --> 32:20.150]  That's from Adrian.
[32:20.150 --> 32:21.150]  That could be a male or a female, so thanks, Adrian,
[32:21.150 --> 32:23.150]  whichever sexual gender you are.
[32:23.150 --> 32:25.150]  We appreciate the comment.
[32:25.150 --> 32:26.150]  You guys keep the comments coming.
[32:26.150 --> 32:28.150]  We'd love to see the comments on iTunes.
[32:28.150 --> 32:32.150]  And in that same theme, thanks, FastBerry, for the tweet.
[32:32.150 --> 32:34.150]  Thanks for following directions, man.
[32:34.150 --> 32:35.150]  That helps.
[32:35.150 --> 32:36.150]  Did FastBerry tweet you?
[32:36.150 --> 32:37.150]  Yep.
[32:37.150 --> 32:38.150]  Nice.
[32:38.150 --> 32:39.150]  Good work, dude.
[32:39.150 --> 32:40.150]  Thanks.
[32:40.150 --> 32:41.150]  He follows myself.
[32:41.150 --> 32:42.150]  He follows Jesse.
[32:42.150 --> 32:43.150]  And Sean also.
[32:43.150 --> 32:44.150]  He's definitely on top of the game.
[32:44.150 --> 32:45.150]  Thanks for supporting us, dude.
[32:45.150 --> 32:46.150]  That is really cool.
[32:46.150 --> 32:51.150]  I think that is all of the super important business we got to take care of.
[32:51.150 --> 32:53.150]  There are no advertisements or anything on the start of the show.
[32:54.150 --> 32:57.150]  We got the shout-out taken care of for the comment.
[32:57.150 --> 32:58.150]  Yes, we did.
[32:58.150 --> 33:00.150]  So in a couple of minutes, actually, I'm going to tell you what's coming up.
[33:00.150 --> 33:03.150]  Mike is going to give us his little — not little.
[33:03.150 --> 33:05.150]  I don't say little because I don't want to downplay it.
[33:05.150 --> 33:11.150]  Mike is going to give us his great presentation about getting you into being a
[33:11.150 --> 33:14.150]  cannabis activist or a lobbyist or just getting your foot into the door to help
[33:14.150 --> 33:17.150]  us support cannabis legalization.
[33:17.150 --> 33:18.150]  Yep.
[33:18.150 --> 33:22.150]  I put together a little spiel on the quick path to step it up and help and
[33:22.150 --> 33:24.150]  fight for legalization in your area.
[33:24.150 --> 33:26.150]  We'll get to that in just a second.
[33:26.150 --> 33:28.150]  This story out of Santa Ana, California.
[33:28.150 --> 33:30.150]  I think I'm saying that right?
[33:30.150 --> 33:32.150]  Someone who is from California?
[33:32.150 --> 33:34.150]  Yes, Santa Ana, California.
[33:34.150 --> 33:36.150]  Mike tweeted this the other day.
[33:36.150 --> 33:38.150]  If you guys follow Mike or the show on Twitter or my personal Twitter.
[33:38.150 --> 33:42.150]  Possibly my most popular tweet ever.
[33:42.150 --> 33:43.150]  Yeah, dude.
[33:43.150 --> 33:45.150]  I got a lot of Twitter notifications because of this.
[33:45.150 --> 33:47.150]  Mike is at Nemopunk15 on Twitter.
[33:47.150 --> 33:50.150]  I am at RastaJeff420.
[33:50.150 --> 33:52.150]  The show is at GFYH Podcast.
[33:52.150 --> 33:56.150]  All of our Twitter started blowing up when this video came out.
[33:56.150 --> 34:00.150]  The title of the video is Santa Ana Pot Shop Raid Sparks Investigation.
[34:00.150 --> 34:02.150]  I want to play the video.
[34:02.150 --> 34:05.150]  I'm pretty sure I can play this video and no one is going to get mad at me.
[34:05.150 --> 34:06.150]  This comes from YouTube.
[34:06.150 --> 34:07.150]  I'm going to play it here on the show.
[34:07.150 --> 34:09.150]  We're going to watch it and I'm going to narrate it.
[34:09.150 --> 34:14.150]  It's going to be a little like a Doug Benson interruption sort of a thing
[34:14.150 --> 34:15.150]  here.
[34:15.150 --> 34:17.150]  We're just going to interrupt this thing and talk a bunch of shit over it
[34:17.150 --> 34:18.150]  and explain what's going on.
[34:18.150 --> 34:21.150]  It starts off with, I'll just, before we even hit play,
[34:21.150 --> 34:24.150]  it starts off with a disclaimer and I want to read that to you guys.
[34:24.150 --> 34:25.150]  It says,
[34:25.150 --> 34:28.150]  The following video shows a raid by Santa Ana police at the Sky High Medical
[34:28.150 --> 34:31.150]  Marijuana Dispensary on May 27, 2015.
[34:31.150 --> 34:34.150]  The footage has been edited by the dispensary's attorneys.
[34:34.150 --> 34:38.150]  The text that appears in the portions of the video also were inserted by the
[34:38.150 --> 34:40.150]  attorneys to explain what they believe was occurring.
[34:40.150 --> 34:42.150]  After reviewing the photo,
[34:42.150 --> 34:46.150]  Santa Ana's police chief says he plans to investigate the officer's actions.
[34:46.150 --> 34:49.150]  So I'm going to hit play and I may have to adjust the volume a couple of
[34:49.150 --> 34:51.150]  times. Oh, I still got the reggae playing from the intro.
[34:51.150 --> 34:54.150]  I'm going to have to adjust the volume because it's a YouTube video and it
[34:54.150 --> 34:56.150]  gets choppy. All right, before you hit play, man,
[34:56.150 --> 34:58.150]  just a little background for the, for everybody listening.
[34:58.150 --> 35:03.150]  So the city in question here decided that they were going to ban all
[35:04.150 --> 35:07.150]  dispensaries at least for now.
[35:08.150 --> 35:11.150]  And there were several that have opened up,
[35:11.150 --> 35:16.150]  had opened up already or opened up in the face of the ban and continued to
[35:16.150 --> 35:17.150]  operate.
[35:17.150 --> 35:22.150]  So I'm not exactly sure what steps were taken before the video starts playing
[35:22.150 --> 35:25.150]  by the city, but yeah, the video is nuts.
[35:25.150 --> 35:28.150]  I'm not trying to defend anything in it just to give you guys a little heads
[35:28.150 --> 35:32.150]  up as to what led up to the video hitting true starting. All right,
[35:32.150 --> 35:34.150]  so I'm going to hit play now and here we go.
[35:34.150 --> 35:37.150]  I apologize if the volume is wonky, you guys, I'll be on it quickly.
[35:38.150 --> 35:44.000]  All right, so what's happening is that's the battering Ram on the front door.
[35:44.000 --> 35:47.000]  So let's, I'm going to hit pause and talk about this.
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  They're battering, battering, ramming the front door.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  They're busting in the front door, right?
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  They're hitting it with the battering Ram inward.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  It is an outward pulling door.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  If the dude would have grabbed the handle and pulled, right?
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  It would have opened. It was unlocked.
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  It's a business that's open for business.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  The view that we're seeing is coming from a hidden camera and security
[36:05.000 --> 36:08.000]  cameras. The, the security cameras are on the front door.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  The security cameras, the law enforcement tore down all the cameras during the
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  raid, but there were hidden cameras in here at the advice of the attorney.
[36:14.000 --> 36:15.000]  So if you own a dispensary,
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  put up some hidden cameras so that you can catch this shit if it goes on.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  But, uh, all they had to do is pull that door open and walk in.
[36:21.000 --> 36:24.000]  They were a kid. They are slamming the door with the battering Ram.
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  So, all right, then they finally realized, Oh, we can pull,
[36:27.000 --> 36:28.000]  they pull the door open and they come in.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  So they're now rushing in and clearing everywhere.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Yeah.
[36:37.000 --> 36:40.000]  Some of them are carrying pistols. Some of them are carrying assault rifles.
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  They're all in body armor. Most of them are wearing masks.
[36:44.000 --> 36:47.000]  Uh, they bust opened the door of what would be the bud room.
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  And the noise is just so noisy in here,
[36:49.000 --> 36:52.000]  but they start yelling, get on the fucking ground to people.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  And all these people are just customers just shopping here.
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  And they look a little confused. They're like, wait, we're shopping.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  We're not doing anything wrong. So I'm gonna hit play again.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  And the volumes, the sound is terrible on this video,
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  but it's just a security cam footage. So that's what we get. Here we go.
[37:07.780 --> 37:08.780]  So you're hearing me on get on the fucking ground.
[37:09.780 --> 37:12.780]  They're throwing everybody on the ground. Uh, these cops got guns on everybody.
[37:12.780 --> 37:16.780]  Cops got masks. This one cops got his helmet on this one.
[37:16.780 --> 37:21.780]  Dude's not wearing a mask or anything. So then they're getting everybody out.
[37:24.780 --> 37:26.780]  They're telling the employees to turn off the music,
[37:26.780 --> 37:29.780]  turn off that radio because the music is pretty loud in the shop. Right?
[37:30.780 --> 37:35.780]  I love it that all the giant guy cops are in masks and there's like 160 pound
[37:35.780 --> 37:40.780]  female officer and she's not in a mask. What's the mask for fellas?
[37:40.780 --> 37:43.780]  Yeah. Right. She seemed to, the masks will come off soon.
[37:43.780 --> 37:46.780]  Yeah. They come off one of the cops. The cameras are destroyed right now.
[37:46.780 --> 37:48.780]  Sorry, Mike can't see the screen right now. So he doesn't know what's going on,
[37:48.780 --> 37:50.780]  but he's seen the video enough times. Uh,
[37:50.780 --> 37:54.780]  now they are escorting a lady out who was in a wheelchair who I found out later
[37:54.780 --> 37:56.780]  after the video was posted, she is blind.
[37:56.780 --> 37:59.780]  She is blind and in a wheelchair and they're just making them follow.
[37:59.780 --> 38:01.780]  They're like, follow me.
[38:01.780 --> 38:07.780]  She has one leg and she, and yeah, she's just at the shop as a patient.
[38:08.780 --> 38:11.780]  So then it gets worse. Here's what,
[38:11.780 --> 38:15.780]  here's what they had to say about the lady with the amputated leg. Here's here.
[38:15.780 --> 38:16.780]  I'm going to make sure you guys can hear it.
[38:16.780 --> 38:17.780]  Here's what the cops are saying about it.
[38:17.780 --> 38:20.780]  And I've got some sound equipment trying to process it to make it sound better.
[38:20.780 --> 38:23.780]  Also, and this is maybe a 50 or 60 year old woman.
[38:26.780 --> 38:28.780]  Did you punch that one?
[38:32.780 --> 38:36.780]  So the one cop asked, did you punch that old Benita? And the lady cop replied,
[38:36.780 --> 38:38.780]  I was about to kick her in her fucking nub.
[38:38.780 --> 38:40.780]  These are the people that we pay to protect and serve us.
[38:40.780 --> 38:42.780]  These are the people that think they're doing us a service.
[38:42.780 --> 38:44.780]  And the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[38:44.780 --> 38:47.780]  These are the people that are serving and protecting the community.
[38:47.780 --> 38:50.780]  And they're talking about, did you punch that old Benita?
[38:52.780 --> 38:54.780]  It's like a 60 year old woman in a wheelchair with one leg.
[38:55.780 --> 38:56.780]  The handicapped lady.
[38:56.780 --> 38:57.780]  Yeah. Why?
[38:57.780 --> 39:02.780]  What law enforcement action would require you to ever physically assault a 60
[39:02.780 --> 39:03.780]  year old woman in a wheelchair?
[39:03.780 --> 39:06.780]  And why would she want to kick her in her fucking nub?
[39:06.780 --> 39:09.780]  That's not any sort of law enforcement tactic.
[39:09.780 --> 39:12.780]  I'm pretty sure if we look up any law enforcement manual kicker in her
[39:12.780 --> 39:15.780]  fucking nub is not in there ever. Nope. No. All right.
[39:15.780 --> 39:17.780]  I'm going to hit play again. We'll find more bullshit in this.
[39:19.780 --> 39:20.780]  No, it just gets worse.
[39:20.780 --> 39:23.780]  It keeps repeating it. I know they just keep playing it from different angles.
[39:29.780 --> 39:36.500]  So then the next part is the officers climbing up onto the display cases.
[39:36.500 --> 39:39.500]  Oh, no. First he's trying to pull it down with like his crowbar.
[39:39.500 --> 39:42.500]  They're swinging at the cameras on the ceiling with a crowbar and stuff,
[39:42.500 --> 39:47.500]  just smashing security equipment because they don't want what's about to take
[39:47.500 --> 39:50.500]  place to be recorded. Yeah, exactly.
[39:51.500 --> 39:53.500]  And they didn't realize that they were on a hidden camera, which is funny.
[39:53.500 --> 39:56.500]  This guy looked right into it one time. I didn't realize it was a hidden camera.
[39:56.500 --> 39:59.500]  Dispensary had to let it two layers of cameras.
[39:59.500 --> 40:02.500]  So cops completely missed layer number two.
[40:03.500 --> 40:05.500]  It's a nice looking shop to wherever this place was.
[40:05.500 --> 40:07.500]  They had several jars. It's a well set up place.
[40:07.500 --> 40:10.500]  They got a nice looking menu. It's painted well, nice hardwood floors.
[40:10.500 --> 40:12.500]  They were killing it. It looks like a good shop.
[40:12.500 --> 40:15.500]  The lobby doesn't look totally different from the one I work in.
[40:15.500 --> 40:17.500]  We, we, yep.
[40:17.500 --> 40:19.500]  Shout out to the spot dispensary while this video plays.
[40:19.500 --> 40:21.500]  So the cops are now tearing down the cameras.
[40:21.500 --> 40:22.500]  It's a seven minute video guys.
[40:22.500 --> 40:25.500]  And we're probably going to watch the majority of it here while we talk about
[40:25.500 --> 40:26.500]  it.
[40:26.500 --> 40:29.500]  Now the cops are in the offices climbing up on top of the desks and the
[40:29.500 --> 40:31.500]  saves. And, uh,
[40:31.500 --> 40:33.500]  and now they've got bolt cutters so that they can cut the wires on all the
[40:33.500 --> 40:34.500]  shit.
[40:34.500 --> 40:37.500]  And they pull the TV down and just start cutting wires and they're watching
[40:37.500 --> 40:39.500]  the monitor to see where the cameras are.
[40:39.500 --> 40:41.500]  Then they're sending the dudes to go cut it.
[40:41.500 --> 40:43.500]  This dude's in like full on. He looks like fucking GI Joe, bro.
[40:43.500 --> 40:44.500]  He's got a big ass.
[40:44.500 --> 40:46.500]  He's got more guns than you need for a fucking army.
[40:46.500 --> 40:49.500]  These dudes went into a dispensary where people were shopping and doing
[40:49.500 --> 40:52.500]  business like, and rated them like fucking SWAT style.
[40:52.500 --> 40:55.500]  Isn't there a crack house or somewhere that needed to be rated?
[40:55.500 --> 40:56.500]  Apparently not. Yeah.
[40:56.500 --> 40:59.500]  At this point in the video, all the furniture has been smashed.
[40:59.500 --> 41:02.500]  Desks are flipped over. The display cases are all broken open.
[41:02.500 --> 41:04.500]  They're carrying out the DVRs as evidence.
[41:04.500 --> 41:05.500]  So now here's the thing.
[41:05.500 --> 41:07.500]  The cops are now cutting the cameras.
[41:07.500 --> 41:09.500]  They're watching the monitor to see where the cameras are.
[41:09.500 --> 41:10.500]  And they're watching the monitor.
[41:10.500 --> 41:11.500]  And they're watching the monitor.
[41:11.500 --> 41:13.500]  And they're carrying out the DVRs as evidence.
[41:13.500 --> 41:15.500]  So now here's where the video gets funny, guys.
[41:18.500 --> 41:22.500]  So they think they've broken all the cameras and disconnected the DVR.
[41:22.500 --> 41:25.500]  So they don't think anybody can see them now.
[41:25.500 --> 41:28.500]  So now all the masks come off.
[41:28.500 --> 41:29.500]  Yes. Nobody is masked.
[41:29.500 --> 41:32.500]  They are opening each jar and smelling the jars.
[41:32.500 --> 41:35.500]  One of the officers has the buds pressed up against his face,
[41:35.500 --> 41:37.500]  just like you or I would do it and smelling it.
[41:38.500 --> 41:43.500]  And then I got to turn it down a little bit.
[41:43.500 --> 41:48.500]  And then one of the officers, that's one officer asking another for one edible, please.
[41:48.500 --> 41:50.500]  So one of the guys, I'm going to pause it right now.
[41:50.500 --> 41:52.500]  Officer that I don't know his name.
[41:52.500 --> 41:56.500]  He's wearing a white shirt with green sleeves.
[41:56.500 --> 41:59.500]  He's got a shaved head, a beard and a mustache.
[41:59.500 --> 42:01.500]  He just unwrapped a product.
[42:01.500 --> 42:04.500]  I cannot tell you that it was certainly an edible infused with cannabis.
[42:04.500 --> 42:07.500]  But his friend just said, please.
[42:07.500 --> 42:11.500]  And he unwrapped this food product and put it directly into his mouth
[42:11.500 --> 42:17.500]  and offered the second half to his other buddy who is wearing fucking cop uniform, dude.
[42:17.500 --> 42:23.500]  Green pants, greenish gray pants, black police shirt and a bald fucking head and some sunglasses.
[42:23.500 --> 42:26.500]  Kind of kind of muscular handed the other part to him.
[42:26.500 --> 42:28.500]  Let me see if he eats that part.
[42:28.500 --> 42:30.500]  Cut away the video, cut away.
[42:31.500 --> 42:38.500]  The lawyers edited it kind of funny, but they just showed this fucking cop that's raiding the dispensary,
[42:38.500 --> 42:41.500]  eating the edibles from the dispensary that he's raiding.
[42:41.500 --> 42:43.500]  How does that uphold the law?
[42:43.500 --> 42:44.500]  How is that justice?
[42:44.500 --> 42:45.500]  Right.
[42:45.500 --> 42:49.500]  In theory, all of these officers are on duty and they're consuming edibles.
[42:49.500 --> 42:52.500]  And they're all contributing to each other.
[42:52.500 --> 42:53.500]  Right.
[42:53.500 --> 42:54.500]  They're all high fiving and having fun.
[42:54.500 --> 42:56.500]  One of them starts playing darts at one point.
[42:56.500 --> 42:59.500]  So now they're just hanging out, throwing darts.
[42:59.500 --> 43:03.500]  The guy that ate the edible doesn't show any signs of being high right now yet,
[43:03.500 --> 43:06.500]  but I don't know how much time has passed.
[43:08.500 --> 43:11.500]  And they're just sitting around playing darts, texting each other.
[43:11.500 --> 43:12.500]  I don't know who they're texting, but they're all texting.
[43:12.500 --> 43:13.500]  They've got their phones out.
[43:13.500 --> 43:14.500]  They're just dicking around.
[43:14.500 --> 43:16.500]  They're all on the clock laughing.
[43:16.500 --> 43:17.500]  You can hear the giggles.
[43:17.500 --> 43:20.500]  So I think I've mostly proven my point, you guys.
[43:20.500 --> 43:22.500]  These cops raided a dispensary.
[43:22.500 --> 43:25.500]  They were complete disrespectful cunts to handicapped people,
[43:25.500 --> 43:29.500]  a lady in a wheelchair, a blind lady, medical marijuana patients,
[43:29.500 --> 43:32.500]  regular customers, employees of this business.
[43:32.500 --> 43:34.500]  They belittled all these people.
[43:34.500 --> 43:35.500]  They disrespected these people.
[43:35.500 --> 43:37.500]  They violated their civil rights.
[43:37.500 --> 43:40.500]  Then they come in and destroy this place's business.
[43:40.500 --> 43:42.500]  They probably cost them so much money.
[43:42.500 --> 43:44.500]  The store looks like shit now.
[43:44.500 --> 43:46.500]  It was beautiful when they started.
[43:46.500 --> 43:48.500]  Then to add insult to fucking injury.
[43:49.500 --> 43:52.500]  These guys are the people that we pay to protect us, to keep us safe.
[43:52.500 --> 43:55.500]  They came in and they basically robbed this place
[43:55.500 --> 43:58.500]  because now they're eating the products that they were supposed to destroy on camera.
[43:58.500 --> 43:59.500]  They're munching them.
[43:59.500 --> 44:01.500]  It's like laughing in our faces.
[44:01.500 --> 44:06.500]  Oh, wait, this other cop is full on just unwrapped an edible and is grubbing it, dude.
[44:06.500 --> 44:08.500]  Just sitting at the counter, grubbing it, reading the label.
[44:08.500 --> 44:11.500]  Yeah, carrying it around with them and just munching on it like it's fucking a banana.
[44:11.500 --> 44:15.500]  If they just went balls in like that and ate these edibles and didn't get stupid high,
[44:15.500 --> 44:16.500]  they're pot consumers.
[44:16.500 --> 44:17.500]  They're regular consumers.
[44:17.500 --> 44:19.500]  Regular, regular consumers.
[44:19.500 --> 44:23.500]  There's so much disturbing behavior packed into such a short video.
[44:23.500 --> 44:26.500]  He's just munching it, and he gave a thumbs up to somebody like, this is good.
[44:26.500 --> 44:27.500]  Yeah.
[44:27.500 --> 44:29.500]  Oh, they're bagging shit up to take home it looks like.
[44:29.500 --> 44:30.500]  Let's see if he does.
[44:30.500 --> 44:34.500]  I'm assuming that that's about what's about to happen, but I can't promise you.
[44:34.500 --> 44:36.500]  That's my presumption.
[44:36.500 --> 44:39.500]  He put something in a bag, and he's walking off a camera with it.
[44:39.500 --> 44:41.500]  That doesn't look like an evidence bag to me.
[44:41.500 --> 44:42.500]  No, it was a bag from the dispenser.
[44:43.500 --> 44:46.500]  Yeah, it looks like a checkout bag that I fill all day long.
[44:46.500 --> 44:48.500]  Yeah, that's ridiculous, you guys.
[44:48.500 --> 44:53.500]  We'll try to keep you updated on what happens with the Santa Ana police after that.
[44:53.500 --> 44:55.500]  There's definitely going to be some sort of results.
[44:55.500 --> 44:59.500]  There's definitely going to be an investigation going on right now.
[44:59.500 --> 45:02.500]  The mayor has made public comments.
[45:02.500 --> 45:06.500]  It's blowing up, so find the video people and share it around.
[45:06.500 --> 45:07.500]  Make sure everybody sees.
[45:07.500 --> 45:11.500]  I mean, how often do you hear, hey, it's practically legal in California.
[45:11.500 --> 45:13.500]  Just get your medical card, man.
[45:13.500 --> 45:16.500]  Everybody in that shop had a medical card.
[45:16.500 --> 45:18.500]  Hopefully, they just sent the customers home.
[45:18.500 --> 45:21.500]  A long time ago, Mike and I, I was the manager.
[45:21.500 --> 45:23.500]  I had the keys, bro.
[45:23.500 --> 45:26.500]  I used to run the only dispensary in Pueblo.
[45:26.500 --> 45:28.500]  It's pretty much my shop for a little while.
[45:28.500 --> 45:31.500]  Then Mike was my backup bud tender because I couldn't handle it all by myself.
[45:31.500 --> 45:35.500]  I was working 12-hour days, six days a week and killing it.
[45:35.500 --> 45:36.500]  I got Mike in there to help.
[45:36.500 --> 45:40.500]  Then one day, they decided to come in and close us while we had customers in the building.
[45:41.500 --> 45:47.500]  Just to prove a point, Mike, do you want to tell us how they chose to come in and close our medical marijuana dispensary?
[45:47.500 --> 45:49.500]  I can't remember.
[45:49.500 --> 45:51.500]  I think it was just a regular random police officer.
[45:51.500 --> 45:56.500]  Then the city manager at the time walked up to the front door, knocked on the door.
[45:56.500 --> 45:58.500]  Security let him in.
[45:58.500 --> 46:00.500]  They asked to speak to a manager.
[46:00.500 --> 46:03.500]  The manager walked up and asked, hi, what can I do for you?
[46:03.500 --> 46:07.500]  They said, hi, we're from the city of Pueblo, and we've got to deliver this letter.
[46:07.500 --> 46:08.500]  Have a nice day.
[46:08.500 --> 46:10.500]  They turned around and left.
[46:10.500 --> 46:14.500]  The letter said, we haven't passed regulations for dispensaries yet.
[46:14.500 --> 46:16.500]  You have to close.
[46:16.500 --> 46:18.500]  That was the end of it.
[46:18.500 --> 46:20.500]  Nobody wanted to kick any old Benita?
[46:20.500 --> 46:21.500]  Nope.
[46:21.500 --> 46:22.500]  Nothing was smashed.
[46:22.500 --> 46:25.500]  They didn't have to break out the SWAT team.
[46:25.500 --> 46:30.500]  Nobody needed to protect their identity while they destroyed property in a random business.
[46:30.500 --> 46:32.500]  They didn't need to feel intimidating.
[46:32.500 --> 46:34.500]  They didn't need to waste 12 officers' time.
[46:34.500 --> 46:36.500]  They didn't need to fuck up our days.
[46:36.500 --> 46:38.500]  They walked in and said, you guys are fired, basically.
[46:38.500 --> 46:40.500]  They walked in and said, you're fired.
[46:40.500 --> 46:43.500]  You need to find a new job soon, is what they all walked in and said.
[46:43.500 --> 46:45.500]  That was the end of it.
[46:45.500 --> 46:48.500]  They didn't raid or smash or steal anything.
[46:48.500 --> 46:51.500]  There's absolutely no need for this on behalf of the city.
[46:51.500 --> 46:55.500]  Now we've got dispensaries 10 miles away every direction, but not in our city?
[46:55.500 --> 46:56.500]  Right.
[46:56.500 --> 46:57.500]  Pretty stupid.
[46:57.500 --> 46:58.500]  Right on, Pueblo.
[46:58.500 --> 46:59.500]  Good move there.
[46:59.500 --> 47:00.500]  Santa Ana, what the fuck, dude?
[47:00.500 --> 47:01.500]  I want to see how this turns out.
[47:01.500 --> 47:03.500]  Don't let these cops get away with this.
[47:03.500 --> 47:08.500]  If you sent them there to take down this dispensary because cannabis is federally illegal,
[47:08.500 --> 47:12.500]  by eating the evidence there, they definitely committed a huge crime.
[47:12.500 --> 47:14.500]  If I had done that, if you-
[47:14.500 --> 47:15.500]  It's so bizarre.
[47:15.500 --> 47:19.500]  If you caught me destroying evidence on camera, I'd be fucked.
[47:19.500 --> 47:26.500]  The part of the video that really pissed me off, and I knew I had to share it everywhere I possibly could,
[47:26.500 --> 47:30.500]  was right at the end of the video, the fire department shows up,
[47:30.500 --> 47:34.500]  and one of the cops shouts nice and loud and clear for the microphones,
[47:34.500 --> 47:37.500]  fire's here, everybody watch your mouth.
[47:37.500 --> 47:39.500]  It's the police department and the fire department.
[47:39.500 --> 47:43.500]  They're essentially like Batman and fucking Robin, right?
[47:43.500 --> 47:51.500]  Why would the fire department seeing and hearing the police doing police work or business be a bad thing?
[47:51.500 --> 47:54.500]  Why would they have to watch their mouth around the fire department?
[47:54.500 --> 47:55.500]  What's with that?
[47:55.500 --> 47:56.500]  Maybe there's something to that.
[47:56.500 --> 47:57.500]  Is it because you're stealing?
[47:57.500 --> 47:59.500]  Is it because you're eating edibles on the job?
[47:59.500 --> 48:01.500]  You can't drink on the job.
[48:01.500 --> 48:03.500]  I'm pretty sure you can't consume cannabis on the job.
[48:03.500 --> 48:09.500]  If you're a cop raiding a place, you shouldn't be consuming anything from there.
[48:09.500 --> 48:11.500]  Because then you're a Hippocratic prick.
[48:11.500 --> 48:12.500]  Well, no, it's theft.
[48:12.500 --> 48:14.500]  Well, yeah, but then you're also a prick.
[48:14.500 --> 48:18.500]  If I was like, Mike, you're an asshole because you smoke weed, I want to turn you into the police.
[48:18.500 --> 48:21.500]  And you're like, dude, you just took four dabs with me.
[48:21.500 --> 48:22.500]  I'm a Hippocratic prick.
[48:22.500 --> 48:24.500]  You're a definite hypocrite for sure.
[48:24.500 --> 48:27.500]  Yeah, so these cops that are going in and ruining people's lives,
[48:27.500 --> 48:30.500]  and then they're like, oh, well, I'm going to take some of the product that I just ruined your life over.
[48:30.500 --> 48:33.500]  That's such a fucking piece of shit person move.
[48:33.500 --> 48:35.500]  I mean, it doesn't matter what they're raiding.
[48:35.500 --> 48:38.500]  They can't take or eat anything there.
[48:38.500 --> 48:41.500]  I mean, no one's been convicted of a crime.
[48:41.500 --> 48:44.500]  They're just destroying stuff for fun.
[48:44.500 --> 48:46.500]  They're stealing for fun.
[48:46.500 --> 48:51.500]  They're sitting there eating infused cannabis fucking candy on the job.
[48:51.500 --> 48:55.500]  What happens when a call comes in because the bank up the street is getting robbed?
[48:56.500 --> 49:03.500]  Now we've got a cop on a fucking decadose Chibu Chu stumbling through the fucking streets in full body armor with a semi-automatic assault rifle.
[49:03.500 --> 49:05.500]  Please.
[49:05.500 --> 49:08.500]  Like that's the last thing anyone needs is a bunch of cops on edibles.
[49:08.500 --> 49:10.500]  That's the truth.
[49:10.500 --> 49:11.500]  All right.
[49:11.500 --> 49:12.500]  We've got almost 20.
[49:12.500 --> 49:13.500]  We've got 20 minutes right now.
[49:13.500 --> 49:14.500]  So Mike put together some notes.
[49:14.500 --> 49:16.500]  I've been asking him to do it.
[49:16.500 --> 49:19.500]  I want to get more people involved in cannabis activism.
[49:19.500 --> 49:21.500]  This video is a nice little spark.
[49:22.500 --> 49:25.500]  If you're not getting involved and you've kept your head down to this point.
[49:25.500 --> 49:28.500]  I mean, this is in California where weeds basically legal.
[49:28.500 --> 49:35.500]  They're arresting people threatening to kick an old woman in a wheelchair because she didn't hustle the fuck up fast enough.
[49:35.500 --> 49:36.500]  I mean, come on.
[49:36.500 --> 49:38.500]  It's just absolutely ludicrous.
[49:38.500 --> 49:41.500]  Everybody needs to say enough is enough and stand up.
[49:41.500 --> 49:43.500]  And we're about to tell you how to do that.
[49:43.500 --> 49:44.500]  Yeah.
[49:44.500 --> 49:45.500]  All right, guys.
[49:45.500 --> 49:49.500]  This is my good buddy Mike, and he's going to help you guys learn how to stand up for cannabis.
[49:49.500 --> 49:50.500]  You need another drink, bro?
[49:50.500 --> 49:52.500]  I see you over there shaking your half empty bottles.
[49:52.500 --> 49:54.500]  You want a water or one of these cans?
[49:54.500 --> 49:55.500]  I'm good.
[49:55.500 --> 49:56.500]  This one's fresh.
[49:56.500 --> 49:57.500]  All right.
[49:57.500 --> 49:58.500]  We got you.
[49:58.500 --> 50:03.500]  So, all right, so it's time to stand up and get involved, folks.
[50:03.500 --> 50:05.500]  So how do you go about doing that?
[50:05.500 --> 50:11.500]  The first thing I would say is figure out what about cannabis you're really passionate about.
[50:11.500 --> 50:15.500]  Do you love how it relaxes you at the end of the day?
[50:15.500 --> 50:18.500]  Do you love getting nice and high and playing video games?
[50:18.500 --> 50:25.500]  Do you like the social aspect of sitting in a circle with your friends, passing a joint and talking about whatever?
[50:25.500 --> 50:28.500]  Do you enjoy different medical aspects of it?
[50:28.500 --> 50:29.500]  Does it ease your pain?
[50:29.500 --> 50:31.500]  Does it stop your seizures?
[50:31.500 --> 50:35.500]  Does it allow you to eat through the nausea of whatever?
[50:35.500 --> 50:37.500]  Is it helping fight your cancer?
[50:37.500 --> 50:41.500]  What's got you really passionate about cannabis?
[50:41.500 --> 50:43.500]  What sparks that fire?
[50:43.500 --> 50:46.500]  Because you're going to need some fire because some of this gets really dull.
[50:47.500 --> 50:52.500]  A lot of you have a sick family member that you need to fight for because they're not able to do it.
[50:52.500 --> 50:56.500]  People ask me all day long about I have a sick friend.
[50:56.500 --> 50:59.500]  What product should I point them towards?
[50:59.500 --> 51:06.500]  I have people asking me about their pain all day or their ailments and what cannabis might do for them.
[51:06.500 --> 51:11.500]  And so there's a lot of people out there that know it's about a lot more than just getting high.
[51:11.500 --> 51:14.500]  But even if it's just about getting high for you, that's fine.
[51:15.500 --> 51:19.500]  Humans have enjoyed intoxicants since before we had a society.
[51:19.500 --> 51:25.500]  I mean, even little kids spin around in circles to break free of reality for a minute and enjoy it.
[51:25.500 --> 51:27.500]  I mean, it's just something humans like.
[51:27.500 --> 51:28.500]  And cannabis is great for that.
[51:28.500 --> 51:31.500]  It's the safest intoxicant known to man.
[51:31.500 --> 51:34.500]  Every other intoxicant causes a lot of harm to your body.
[51:34.500 --> 51:36.500]  Cannabis doesn't.
[51:36.500 --> 51:38.500]  The feds have been looking for a long time, folks.
[51:38.500 --> 51:43.500]  When you start doing your research, you're going to learn that as far as intoxicants go,
[51:43.500 --> 51:47.500]  I mean, even just beer and alcohol, cannabis is far, far safer.
[51:47.500 --> 51:52.500]  So if you just prefer it over alcohol, that's still a great reason to stand up and say,
[51:52.500 --> 51:54.500]  Hey, we need to legalize this in my area.
[51:54.500 --> 51:56.500]  You don't have to be super sick.
[51:56.500 --> 51:58.500]  I'm going to take a dab because Mike's got a lot to say.
[51:58.500 --> 51:59.500]  I usually don't get a dab so hard on the show.
[51:59.500 --> 52:00.500]  Keep going, bro.
[52:00.500 --> 52:01.500]  I like it.
[52:01.500 --> 52:02.500]  All right.
[52:02.500 --> 52:03.500]  So now you've got that spark lit.
[52:03.500 --> 52:07.500]  You know what really turns you on about cannabis.
[52:07.500 --> 52:09.500]  It's time to start getting educated.
[52:09.500 --> 52:12.500]  You need to start learning a couple of different things.
[52:12.500 --> 52:14.500]  One, start researching cannabis.
[52:14.500 --> 52:17.500]  It's got a long and interesting history.
[52:17.500 --> 52:24.500]  At this point in time, the medical research and the research on safety for consumption,
[52:24.500 --> 52:29.500]  even if you're smoking big old fat joints all the time, vaporizers are a lot healthier way to consume.
[52:29.500 --> 52:31.500]  You get to skip that burning plant material.
[52:31.500 --> 52:37.500]  But even if you're puffing J's old school, you're not doing the kind of damage to your body that a tobacco smoker is.
[52:37.500 --> 52:40.500]  It's not a one-to-one comparison, folks.
[52:40.500 --> 52:44.500]  Get online and start learning everything you can about cannabis.
[52:44.500 --> 52:46.500]  You don't have to sit down and do it all at once.
[52:46.500 --> 52:53.500]  But, I mean, if you love cannabis, learning a lot about it and knowing that you're not killing yourself because you enjoy it,
[52:53.500 --> 52:55.500]  that's something that everybody should want to do.
[52:55.500 --> 52:56.500]  All right.
[52:56.500 --> 53:00.500]  So while you're learning about cannabis, start learning about the laws in your area.
[53:01.500 --> 53:12.500]  If you're in the United States, the Internet, every local government, regardless of how small a town or area you live in, everything's online at this point.
[53:12.500 --> 53:21.500]  Find out when the meetings are happening, how that government's structured, if it's a city council or if it's a board of county commissioners or whatnot.
[53:21.500 --> 53:24.500]  Figure out when they meet and just start going to meetings.
[53:24.500 --> 53:27.500]  Sit in the back and just observe how they play out.
[53:27.500 --> 53:32.500]  One of the things that I laugh a lot about, the anti-pot groups down here never did this step.
[53:32.500 --> 53:35.500]  They just started showing up to meetings and shouting shit.
[53:35.500 --> 53:40.500]  And when you don't know how the meetings function, you don't know where to put your effort.
[53:40.500 --> 53:46.500]  It's sort of like, I don't know, an idiot showing up the first day on the job and just tackling random things in the store.
[53:46.500 --> 53:50.500]  Like, it's not helpful no matter how much energy or passion you're throwing into it.
[53:51.500 --> 53:57.500]  But if you take a couple of really long, boring nights, these meetings can go for two or three hours at a stint and just see how they flow.
[53:57.500 --> 54:02.500]  All of them allow Democratic participation.
[54:02.500 --> 54:04.500]  Any member of the public can show up.
[54:04.500 --> 54:13.500]  And if they follow a couple of really simple, easy rules, like sign up and then speak during the appropriate time of the meeting, I mean, really simple shit.
[54:14.500 --> 54:20.500]  You can get up and say whatever you want as long as you're not cussing at somebody or screaming and yelling at somebody on council.
[54:20.500 --> 54:22.500]  They'll let you rant about whatever.
[54:22.500 --> 54:24.500]  They give you five full minutes, don't they?
[54:24.500 --> 54:27.500]  You get five minutes at the beginning of every meeting down here in Pueblo.
[54:27.500 --> 54:28.500]  You just sign up.
[54:28.500 --> 54:32.500]  They allow six people to sign up every meeting.
[54:32.500 --> 54:34.500]  And you can rant about whatever.
[54:34.500 --> 54:37.500]  And for the most part, it's these three old guys that just show up and bitch.
[54:37.500 --> 54:39.500]  I was going to say, sometimes nobody signs up.
[54:40.500 --> 54:46.500]  Everyone on council down here has thanked me for breaking up the tedium of the couple people that speak.
[54:46.500 --> 54:50.500]  They don't all agree with me, but they appreciate me going and saying something coherent.
[54:50.500 --> 54:53.500]  And they're down to hear whatever.
[54:53.500 --> 54:56.500]  There are people that have come and spoke out about roadside memorials.
[54:56.500 --> 55:00.500]  I mean, whatever issue interests you, you can go down and speak about.
[55:00.500 --> 55:04.500]  So if your issue is cannabis, you can show up to your local town council.
[55:05.500 --> 55:11.500]  And if you've done your homework a little bit, you can point out how many millions of dollars they could make if cannabis was legal in their area.
[55:11.500 --> 55:22.500]  If you take the time to pull the data coming out of Colorado and Washington State, it's been 18 months since recreational stores opened their doors in Colorado.
[55:22.500 --> 55:27.500]  We've got all the data we need to prove just how safe cannabis legalization is.
[55:27.500 --> 55:31.500]  You can have stores that adults 21 years of age or older can walk into.
[55:32.500 --> 55:36.500]  If you throw the shit in well-labeled childproof packaging, it's perfectly safe.
[55:36.500 --> 55:38.500]  There's no harm caused.
[55:38.500 --> 55:42.500]  There's no increase in any DUIs or teen access.
[55:42.500 --> 55:45.500]  I mean, there's so much cannabis out there anyway.
[55:45.500 --> 55:52.500]  All the stores do is change who profits from the sale and where a whole bunch of adults choose to go to buy their weed.
[55:52.500 --> 55:55.500]  Like, legalization isn't a huge earth-shattering change.
[55:55.500 --> 55:58.500]  It's just the end of a lot of stupidity.
[55:58.500 --> 55:59.500]  Yes.
[55:59.500 --> 56:02.500]  In Colorado, we've been keeping tally of the numbers.
[56:02.500 --> 56:04.500]  People have been watching very closely.
[56:04.500 --> 56:06.500]  This was supposed to be a nightmare.
[56:06.500 --> 56:10.500]  All of the predictions a year or two ago are laughable now.
[56:10.500 --> 56:14.500]  The local paper, the Chieftain, does a shit job regularly.
[56:14.500 --> 56:20.500]  And miracle of miracles, they did an amazing expose on what legal marijuana did to our county.
[56:20.500 --> 56:25.500]  We sold $17 million worth of marijuana, and the cops can't point to a firm problem.
[56:25.500 --> 56:27.500]  It's just nuts.
[56:28.500 --> 56:30.500]  $17 million.
[56:30.500 --> 56:32.500]  There's only 150,000 people down here.
[56:32.500 --> 56:34.500]  I mean, do the math.
[56:34.500 --> 56:36.500]  And it's not like the black market died.
[56:36.500 --> 56:40.500]  It's just a huge number of people prefer going to the stores.
[56:40.500 --> 56:43.500]  Buying weed on the black market can be a nightmare, man.
[56:43.500 --> 56:48.500]  I mean, we're so spoiled in Colorado, it's kind of hard to think back to what it used to be like.
[56:48.500 --> 56:49.500]  Yeah.
[56:49.500 --> 56:54.500]  But a lot of people have a hardcore dealer that they've got to deal with.
[56:54.500 --> 56:56.500]  They operate under dealer rules.
[56:56.500 --> 56:58.500]  Like you meet in a parking lot, it's a quick exchange.
[56:58.500 --> 57:00.500]  You're not friends.
[57:00.500 --> 57:01.500]  You get ripped off.
[57:01.500 --> 57:02.500]  The bag's light.
[57:02.500 --> 57:03.500]  It's got other crap in it.
[57:03.500 --> 57:05.500]  It's never the strain, they say.
[57:05.500 --> 57:08.500]  Cops looking to arrest you for doing it.
[57:08.500 --> 57:11.500]  I had some friends in from Wisconsin.
[57:11.500 --> 57:12.500]  They're like friends of a friend.
[57:12.500 --> 57:14.500]  My good friend had family in from Wisconsin.
[57:14.500 --> 57:17.500]  And they're like, we went to the dispensary over here.
[57:17.500 --> 57:19.500]  And I was like, oh, you went there and paid like.
[57:19.500 --> 57:23.500]  And they're like, yeah, they wanted to go to that place because they heard a lot about it and wanted to see what it was like.
[57:23.500 --> 57:26.500]  They just wanted the experience of going through the store.
[57:26.500 --> 57:27.500]  I keep going.
[57:27.500 --> 57:28.500]  I'm getting off track now.
[57:28.500 --> 57:30.500]  So get educated.
[57:30.500 --> 57:36.500]  Learn the laws in your area, how the public meetings work, and when and how public comment is taken.
[57:36.500 --> 57:41.500]  And then look up other legalization groups in your area, guys.
[57:41.500 --> 57:43.500]  There are a ton of groups out there.
[57:43.500 --> 57:48.500]  In the 1970s, we were really close to marijuana being legal too.
[57:49.500 --> 57:53.500]  And when that fell apart, a number of groups started forming nationally.
[57:53.500 --> 57:55.500]  Normal's the big one.
[57:55.500 --> 57:56.500]  That's what I just wrote down.
[57:56.500 --> 58:01.500]  If you're not familiar with normal, you really, really need to start Googling stuff about cannabis.
[58:01.500 --> 58:05.500]  That's the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[58:05.500 --> 58:06.500]  Yes, it is.
[58:06.500 --> 58:08.500]  There's also the Marijuana Policy Project.
[58:08.500 --> 58:11.500]  They're doing national lobbying for legalization.
[58:11.500 --> 58:13.500]  They've helped write a number of the laws.
[58:13.500 --> 58:15.500]  I think they helped with Colorado's.
[58:15.500 --> 58:17.500]  They helped with Alaska's.
[58:17.500 --> 58:20.500]  They've written a number of other medical marijuana laws.
[58:20.500 --> 58:22.500]  They're a really big organization.
[58:22.500 --> 58:23.500]  Check them out, guys.
[58:23.500 --> 58:28.500]  Students for a Sensible Drug Policy is on pretty much every college campus in America.
[58:28.500 --> 58:31.500]  LEAP, Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, guys.
[58:31.500 --> 58:44.500]  This is ex-cops, ex-DEA agents, judges, lawyers that, through experience, have learned just how pointless marijuana prohibition is and have begun calling for legalization.
[58:44.500 --> 58:45.500]  They're a great group, guys.
[58:45.500 --> 58:47.500]  Follow them on social media.
[58:47.500 --> 58:50.500]  Some of their YouTube videos are great.
[58:50.500 --> 58:55.500]  Learning, okay, so I'm going to start going out and speaking for legalization.
[58:55.500 --> 58:57.500]  What the fuck does that look like?
[58:57.500 --> 59:00.500]  Do I just go to city council and go, free weed?
[59:00.500 --> 59:02.500]  Or what do I do?
[59:02.500 --> 59:04.500]  Pull up LEAP's videos on YouTube, man.
[59:04.500 --> 59:07.500]  This guy, Peter Crist is his name.
[59:07.500 --> 59:13.500]  Pull him up on YouTube and just watch him destroy the idea of prohibition in 15 minutes.
[59:14.500 --> 59:16.500]  It's a great place to start, guys.
[59:16.500 --> 59:22.500]  And the last organization I'd say everybody needs to check out is a group called Flex Your Rights.
[59:22.500 --> 59:34.500]  If you're going to go and start speaking up about marijuana legalization in an area where it's not already medically legal or there's not a number of other people doing that, it can be terrifying.
[59:34.500 --> 59:43.500]  And one of the things that's really going to help you feel a lot more secure in doing that is knowing what your rights are as a citizen in the good old United States of America.
[59:43.500 --> 59:54.500]  Flex Your Rights is an organization of defense attorneys that have put together a number of great videos and little training webpages on flexing your rights.
[59:54.500 --> 59:59.500]  What rights do you have when a cop pounds on your door and says, open up, police?
[59:59.500 --> 01:00:00.500]  What can you do?
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500]  We should all watch that anyway.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:05.500]  Everyone that's listening right now should pull up these videos.
[01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.500]  What are your rights when you get pulled over during a traffic stop?
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:22.500]  I mean, if you get on YouTube and watch some of the same shit I do, you've seen people refuse to roll their window down and just hand or put up IDs to the window and completely refuse what the cop's saying and just do something different.
[01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500]  And the cops all look befuddled.
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:30.500]  And then the important cop walks over, tells the other cops they don't get to smash the window and they don't get to ruin this guy's night.
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.500]  And the guy's free to leave.
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.500]  Learn how to do that legally.
[01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:44.500]  I know it's terrifying to stand up in front of the police chief because the police chief said a lot of these meetings, the city councils at these meetings, the city attorney, everyone's in a suit and tie.
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:52.500]  There are cameras rolling and you're going to stand up and encourage them to legalize marijuana or to push for legalization.
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:54.500]  It can be really scary.
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:01:04.500]  But if you know your rights and you've paid attention in the meetings and you know how they flow and you make your argument at the appropriate time, the appropriate way, they're going to hear you.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:08.500]  They're going to be impressed and they're going to want to know more.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:14.500]  And so if you've done your homework and you're educated, when they come up to you after the meeting and go, I like what you said, can we sit down later?
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:20.500]  I want to hear about what pot legalization might do for our little town here in Kentucky.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:35.500]  You can go to lunch later and really explain, okay, in Colorado towns this size that allowed this many shops made this much in tax revenue, this much in application fees, they spent this much in enforcement.
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:39.500]  And so they're able to spend an extra this much on their roads this year.
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:47.500]  When you make that argument to someone in local government, they're going to just be astounded at the possibilities.
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:50.500]  They're going to have to look at this issue in a new way.
[01:01:50.500 --> 01:01:52.500]  $17 million.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:53.500]  It was an issue.
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.500]  Pueblo is a poor town.
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.500]  Half the people down here are on some form of assistance.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:00.500]  It's actually like 60%.
[01:02:02.500 --> 01:02:06.500]  The median income down here is like 14 grand a year.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500]  Yeah, Jeff just looked at me a little horrified.
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.500]  I was a little shocked too.
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.500]  And yeah, it's a big city full of a lot of people in hard times.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:16.500]  So this industry has been huge.
[01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.500]  The jobs, the local investment in the city.
[01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.500]  Hop on the Chieftain.
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:31.500]  If you go to thechieftain.com and scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page on the right hand side, they've got a couple of big exposed days they've done.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:33.500]  And one of them is called the growing trade.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.500]  Or I suppose you could just Google the Chieftain, the growing trade.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:43.500]  It brings up a big series of reports and they break down what the police had to say after the county sold $17 million in pot last year.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:49.500]  What the teachers had to say and the principals, what the fire department had to say.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:57.500]  They tallied up what the county spent on enforcement and going out and making sure that you met zoning and that you were checking IDs and all of that.
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:03.500]  They added up everything they could think of that was related to legal pot and they tallied it in one column.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:08.500]  And it was like $220,000 and they pulled in $1.7 million.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.500]  I mean that's a million and a half.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.500]  It's a huge return on a small investment.
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:16.500]  I mean all they had to do was get out of the way.
[01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:21.500]  And I also think that we're bringing more people here because I know we're bringing more people here.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:25.500]  Colorado is seeing a flood of people coming.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.500]  It's almost like the gold rushes before.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:28.500]  We're not just moving but visiting.
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:32.500]  They're coming to just to come buy a bag of weed and go on a hike.
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:43.500]  There's lots of people coming to visit and checking out and what I'm hoping they all take home is when they get home they need to tell everyone they know how sane and rational this decision was.
[01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.500]  I mean a lot of people are shocked.
[01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:47.500]  Oh my God, you're going to add another legal intoxicant to the mix.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.500]  It's going to be terrible for society.
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:52.500]  I mean marijuana's never killed anyone.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.500]  Alcohol kills almost 100,000 people a year and that's before the car crashes.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:59.500]  Tobacco kills almost half a million people every year.
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:04.500]  And that's from using, getting diseases from using and dying.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500]  Police kill more people than cannabis.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.500]  500 already this year just because I know that's that off the top of my head.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:14.500]  Peanuts kill more people than cannabis every year.
[01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.500]  Lightning kills 52 Americans a year.
[01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.500]  I was just had to look that shit up recently.
[01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:21.500]  All right, we're getting off track here.
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.500]  Keep going dude because you got quite a bit of shit.
[01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:24.500]  We've gone 36 minutes.
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:25.500]  I want to make sure you get this in.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:27.500]  All right, so we're passionate.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:28.500]  We're educated.
[01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.500]  We've started attending meetings and figuring out how they work.
[01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.500]  All right, so you're going to start speaking out.
[01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.500]  This is the terrifying part.
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:44.500]  Like it's easy to sit at home and Google does cannabis cure cancer and then read what Dr.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:52.500]  Tashkin has to say about that or to Google the history of cannabis and spend the night reading about how the federal government's run a medical marijuana program.
[01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:54.500]  Every year I've fucking been alive.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.500]  It started in 1982 people.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.500]  They mail people 11 ounces of weed.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.500]  How the fuck did you not know about this?
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.500]  Google it right now, but that's easy.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.500]  It's not scary.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.500]  No one's going to follow you home from that.
[01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:16.500]  But going down to city council and standing up at the podium and swearing in giving your name and address and then speaking out for legalization can be scary.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.500]  But if you do it right, you're going to succeed.
[01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:20.500]  People are going to hear you.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500]  No one's going to follow you home.
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:34.500]  It's even like an extra layer of protection because if the cops are going to screw with the person that's going to city council and making a stink, it's going to be press into the cops want press.
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.500]  They're going to bring, you know, the district attorney and cops do not need any press.
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:39.500]  Right now.
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.500]  They don't want any of that.
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:42.500]  So they pretty much leave you alone.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:45.500]  I've never had an issue and I've been doing this for like six years now.
[01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:51.500]  So what you got to do is figure out what you want to say and how you want to say it.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.500]  Are you talking about medical access?
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.500]  Are you talking about full blown legalization?
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:03.500]  Take a few minutes and really pen out what you want to say.
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:09.500]  Make a couple of bullet point notes of the points you want to hit and then practice it a couple of times at home.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.500]  Get yourself familiar with it because it can be really nerve wracking.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:13.500]  I hate public speaking.
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:16.500]  I'm nervous sitting here on the podcast and I love it in your kitchen.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:18.500]  You'll get shaky the first time.
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:22.500]  But I hear a lot of people get shaky and city council knows they look like it's all right.
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:23.500]  They're used to it.
[01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:26.500]  And if you're struggling, they'll even like it's OK.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.500]  You can say whatever you want.
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:29.500]  You can't get in trouble here.
[01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:32.500]  Like they try to reassure you a little bit, even if they disagree with you.
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.500]  If they see that you're nervous, they're really nice about it.
[01:06:34.500 --> 01:06:37.500]  But plan out what you want to say.
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:44.500]  Practice it a couple of times at home and then go down to the meeting or just throw on clean clothes.
[01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:45.500]  Like that's the key people.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.500]  You don't have to dress way up.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.500]  I go in jeans and a button down shirt.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.500]  Stick your head to every meeting.
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:52.500]  Take off your hat.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.500]  If you've got dreads, tie them back neat.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.500]  If you've got a big beard, maybe clean it up a little bit.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500]  But just clean clothes.
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.500]  Look nice.
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:02.500]  You don't have to go buy a suit or anything.
[01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:08.500]  Honestly, there are some guys that come in there looking like they just and they're wearing their work uniform.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:10.500]  And they're like, hey, I'm part of this union.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.500]  And you're like, oh, I could tell.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.500]  And we feel this way.
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:18.500]  And I think that shows that they're a working fucking man and that they're speaking about what they've got to do.
[01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.500]  You know what I mean?
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.500]  Right.
[01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:24.500]  If you're coming straight from work, it's perfectly appropriate to show up in whatever you were wearing at work that day.
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.500]  People do that all the time because most of these meetings are at like 6 o'clock at night.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:29.500]  And that's pretty much when everybody's headed home.
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:30.500]  We've got a normal job.
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.500]  So just throw on something clean if you can.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500]  Get yourself cleaned up a little bit.
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:36.500]  Practice what you're going to say.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:38.500]  Then go down, sign up and say it.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:41.500]  So, yeah, throw on a clean shirt.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:44.500]  Go down, sign up and speak.
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.500]  Be polite.
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:49.500]  I like to start off with good evening, council.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:54.500]  I think going like gentleman and lady makes you sound like a dick.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:59.500]  So if there's men and women on the council, you can just skip all of that nonsense with good evening, council.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.500]  Or good evening, Board of County Commissioners.
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500]  Just use their formal title.
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.500]  And then say what you've got to say.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:10.500]  And at the end, try to say thank you for giving me this chance to speak tonight.
[01:08:10.500 --> 01:08:12.500]  They really appreciate it when people thank them.
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]  And then hang out at the meeting.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:18.500]  That's the part that everyone, regardless of their issue, skips.
[01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:30.500]  The night you go speak at the meeting, nine times out of ten, when the section of time where the public can speak is over, everyone in the meeting shuffles out.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:34.500]  The city council down here even pauses for a minute to allow it to happen.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:46.500]  But the very next step of the meeting is council commentary, where they sit and banter back and forth for a few minutes about what they just heard and about other shit that's come up that week.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:53.500]  And that's the important part of the meeting if you're arguing with them about anything.
[01:08:54.500 --> 01:09:09.500]  Knowing the issues city council cares about, knowing the different projects they're working on in the city, knowing out of the hundreds of emails they get each week, which one or two they choose to bring up at city council as though it's a folksy fucking antidote.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:13.500]  Knowing that stuff helps you structure your argument.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:18.500]  Maybe it'll help you figure out which one of those council members is on your side.
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.500]  And you can kind of buddy up with them.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:24.500]  Especially after you've spoken because they frequently discuss what they heard that night before.
[01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:32.500]  And I can't tell you how many times I've heard, I wish the person who spoke earlier was still in this room because we'd like to thank him for coming and speaking out.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:35.500]  You know, when we know it's tough to do and da-da-da-da.
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:39.500]  The last one was this really sweet kid. He was super nervous. He kept stopping.
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:45.500]  I heard him talking before the meeting. He didn't have a stammer. He fully had a stammer while he was testifying.
[01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:47.500]  And he was talking about the homeless problem down here.
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.500]  And he left immediately after he spoke.
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:10:03.500]  And the council spent maybe 20 minutes debating the issue and gathering city resources, asking the city manager about resources to help the kid with his issue or to address some of the issues the kid brought up.
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:05.500]  And it would have been great if he was there for that.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.500]  But he was already gone.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:08.500]  He was gone. And I doubt he'll pull it up online later.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.500]  I've been there when they've called upon you to answer a cannabis question.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.500]  They're like, Michael, are you here?
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.500]  Or the one guy's like, that guy over there knows. Let him speak.
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:18.500]  And you just stand up and you're like, the answer is this.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:21.500]  And the people look at you like you're a fucking robot.
[01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.500]  So become, you guys can all become that guy for council.
[01:10:24.500 --> 01:10:27.500]  And don't expect it to happen overnight.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.500]  I've been watching Mike do this for probably eight years.
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:32.500]  It takes a lot of time, folks.
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:38.500]  When you first go at best, you're the articulate guy talking about weed.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:46.500]  The fifth time you go and speak, you're the really articulate guy who comes to meetings and knows what he's talking about.
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:53.500]  And he really seems to know, you know, he's presenting an argument in a way that a lot of people are really starting to listen to.
[01:10:53.500 --> 01:10:59.500]  And after the first year or so, you're the person they think of when that issue comes up.
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:04.500]  I should get a hold of that guy and ask him what his take on this issue is.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.500]  Now I get two or three calls a week from reporters down here.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:11.500]  Sometimes fact checking a story they're doing.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.500]  Sometimes asking for my take on an issue.
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:17.500]  I'm forever running to the news or running to the newsstand to grab a paper.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:20.500]  Like it's just something that comes up after you start doing it for a while.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:24.500]  We'll be in the car and both of our phones will ring and it's the same reporter.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:26.500]  Texting his both like bleep bleep.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:28.500]  Do you know someone who can blank?
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:30.500]  And we both look at each other and chuckle.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500]  What's the answer to this odd cannabis question?
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:35.500]  I've been in the car with Mike and city council members have called him.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:36.500]  He's like turn down the music dude.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500]  I got the reggae full blast.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:41.500]  And he's like, this is a council member.
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.500]  You'll have to turn that down.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:48.500]  The meetings are real formal and there's, it's so procedural.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:52.500]  And there's police officers and the heads of the city or the town or whatever there.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:57.500]  So it seems really rigid and kind of terrifying.
[01:11:57.500 --> 01:12:05.500]  But once you've gone a few times, you see that it's just bored politicians who desperately want someone else to give a shit.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:11.500]  And they're super happy to have anyone come down to the meetings and be interested the whole time.
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:15.500]  The only people that are there are paid to be there or people that are asking for something.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.500]  When you start showing up, is the guy saying I've done my homework.
[01:12:21.500 --> 01:12:30.500]  I figured out the marijuana legalization could save our county $100,000 and make our county $200,000 on top of that.
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.500]  So it's 300 grand total.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.500]  They freak the fuck out.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.500]  Everybody else goes, here's my issue.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.500]  I need 10 grand.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:38.500]  Here's my issue.
[01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:41.500]  I need 35 grand or even 50 bucks.
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.500]  The youth center needs another $3,000.
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:45.500]  The parking thing needs this much.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.500]  Yep, I've seen it.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:54.500]  When you show up and say I found a way for you to make a huge amount of money or a way to bring a whole bunch of jobs to our area.
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:13:01.500]  I mean, when you tell your argument well, you can really hit these people in ways that they're going to go home thinking about.
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.500]  Mike has given you guys like 12 good points to make.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:08.500]  The tax money that it's bringing in, the jobs that it's going to make.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:10.500]  Mike has already gotten you guys a bunch of head starts.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.500]  I mean, 10 years ago when I was studying this stuff in college, it was all theoretical.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:18.500]  We could guess what legalization might do to an area.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:23.500]  We could look at Amsterdam and kind of guesstimate what that would look like in Denver.
[01:13:23.500 --> 01:13:28.500]  But it's been 15 years since our medical marijuana laws passed.
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:35.500]  2008 was the dispensary explosion with the medical marijuana heyday that we always talk about on the show.
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:36.500]  That was 2008.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.500]  That was seven years ago.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:39.500]  Wow.
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:47.500]  And so the data that's been collected over all that time, the cops were sure this was going to lead to the apocalypse.
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:51.500]  The rehab industry was sure this was going to lead to the apocalypse.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500]  The government was sure.
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:55.500]  And so everybody was keeping records.
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:14:02.500]  The Department of Revenue in Colorado, you can go on their website and pull the tax numbers by county, man.
[01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:07.500]  You can see what the 1% kickback that the generating area gets from the state adds up to.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.500]  For every little town that allows it.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:16.500]  And so you can pull those numbers wherever you are on the planet now and say, our little town has 40,000 people.
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:20.500]  I've done the math and we can make this much or save this much.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.500]  Make this much.
[01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:22.500]  Definitely.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:26.500]  It will cost you a little, but I mean, over a year's time, you're going to, we've seen what we did.
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.500]  We made $17 million here.
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:30.500]  You're not experimenting anymore.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:35.500]  You're just looking at the reality and choosing the course that makes the most sense.
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:38.500]  All right, dude, we've gone just over 45 minutes.
[01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500]  I'll let you go.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:41.500]  You got to be done in 14 minutes at the most.
[01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:43.500]  I'm pretty much done, man.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:54.500]  If you guys have questions about getting involved or need help finding something research wise, feel free to tweet me or feel free to shoot the podcast and email and we'll get those answers on the show.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:55.500]  Yeah, we'd love to.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:56.500]  We love the interaction.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:15:01.500]  If we skipped something, if there's something else that you need more details on, get it, Mike, get it myself, get it the show.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:02.500]  We'll answer it for you.
[01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.500]  Basically, go ahead, bro.
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.500]  You got something else?
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.500]  Go for it.
[01:15:06.500 --> 01:15:07.500]  Do it.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:08.500]  Just start Googling.
[01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:12.500]  If you can't find the answer with two or three Google questions, send me a tweet.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.500]  You don't teach you how to Google.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.500]  There we go.
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:15.500]  And we'll definitely help you.
[01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:17.500]  All human information is on the Internet.
[01:15:17.500 --> 01:15:20.500]  Now you just have to ask Google correctly and it will bring it to you.
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.500]  Mike gave out a bunch of groups that we should support.
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:24.500]  Those groups all report a repeat them.
[01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:25.500]  They were normal.
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:29.500]  It's NORML, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:32.500]  The MPP, the medical, remind me what the marijuana.
[01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.500]  Marijuana Policy Project.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:34.500]  Policy Project.
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:35.500]  It's policy.
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.500]  Yeah, yeah, I saw it coming.
[01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:39.500]  LEAP, that's Law Enforcement Against Prohibition.
[01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.500]  Make sure you check those guys out.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.500]  They have a lot of stuff.
[01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:47.500]  Peter Crist will show you how to keep yourself out of trouble and flexyourrights.com.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:48.500]  Is that it?
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.500]  Flexyourrights.com.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.500]  Yep, flexyourrights.com, I believe.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:52.500]  If you just Google flex your rights, it'll come right up.
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:59.500]  Yeah, check out that because then you can learn how to protect yourself in an interaction with law enforcement.
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:06.500]  In an upcoming video, we're going to watch, or an upcoming episode, we're going to watch a video of some cops smoking cannabis for the first time.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:07.500]  They're retired police officers.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:08.500]  I love that video.
[01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:11.500]  I haven't seen the video yet, but we're definitely going to watch that here on the show.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.500]  What else do we have coming up?
[01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:15.500]  I think Clint is going to be on a future episode.
[01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.500]  Nice, I love it when Clint's on the show.
[01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:27.500]  Him and I went to see, him and I and a few other friends actually went to see Doug Benson on 420, and Doug recorded a comedy album on 420, and the album is now out.
[01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:33.500]  And Clint and I both downloaded it, and we have listened to it, and we're going to review the album here on the show.
[01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.500]  Nice.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.500]  And then we're going to get Clint's stupid high.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.500]  That's what I think is going to happen on that episode.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.500]  I want to be here for his first dab.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.500]  I don't think Clint will ever take a dab.
[01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:42.500]  He's afraid.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:44.500]  Everybody is at first.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500]  All right, you guys, we're going to start wrapping up the show.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.500]  Before I get too far, I want to give a big shout out to my homie, Deez.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:57.500]  The other day, I played a really dancey electronic song at the end of the podcast, and that was from my buddy, Deez.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500]  We're going to play that one again here at the end of the episode.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.500]  I'm going to make a note to do that.
[01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:05.500]  Also, huge, huge shout outs to Sonny, Revae, and Arnie.
[01:17:05.500 --> 01:17:07.500]  My friend, Sonny, threw a party Saturday night.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:16.500]  He invited me to come play some drums with kind of a band that we'd never met before, and we put a band together that night, and we played a bunch of songs for a few hours, and we killed it.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.500]  It was a lot of fun.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:18.500]  Shout out to Sonny for the invite.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.500]  Shout out to Revae and Arnie for joining me.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.500]  It was great fun.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.500]  I look forward to doing that again in the very near future.
[01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.500]  Big shout out to the Spot Dispensary.
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:30.500]  Shout out to the Grammy Gatsby.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:33.500]  Mike, big old shout out for coming on the show and teaching people how to get involved.
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.500]  That's what we've needed for a little bit here.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.500]  Thanks, bro.
[01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.500]  I've been looking forward to doing this show.
[01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.500]  I hope I didn't go too fast for you all.
[01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.500]  Feel free to tweet me.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.500]  It's at DMOPUNK15.
[01:17:44.500 --> 01:17:46.500]  We can direct message about whatever.
[01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.500]  I can help you get involved.
[01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:58.500]  I've spent like 10 years passionately researching cannabis, the history, the medical effects, all of that, so I'm happy to point you in whatever direction you're looking to get informed on.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.500]  Guys, just hit me up.
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:00.500]  Hit up the show.
[01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.500]  He knows a lot of shit, too.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.500]  It's not a real narrow scope.
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.500]  He knows kind of a broad scope.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.500]  Right.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:10.500]  If it's any at all weed or social policy related, I have researched the shit out of it, and I'm happy to help.
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:11.500]  Yes.
[01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:12.500]  All right.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.500]  Well, thanks for helping us, dude.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.500]  You guys, thanks for listening to another episode.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:18.500]  I'll be back Monday with I think it's going to be episode 78 Monday.
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:19.500]  I love it.
[01:18:19.500 --> 01:18:20.500]  Dude, can't wait for 100, man.
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:22.500]  I have no big promises for 100.
[01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:26.500]  I've been trying to focus about two episodes ahead right now, just keep some tight.
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:29.500]  But if you guys have ideas for episode 100, let me know.
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.500]  We'll see what we can do.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:33.500]  So, yeah, now that the show is over.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.500]  Wait, actually, if you're interested in sponsoring, we don't have any sponsors for this month.
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:43.500]  But if you're interested in sponsoring the podcast in an upcoming episode, or if you have a product you'd like me to review, all you have to do is send me an email.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:44.500]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
[01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:46.500]  I'll get you all the information you'd need.
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.500]  Mike and I would love to review your products on the show.
[01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.500]  We'd like to play with all the toys you guys send me.
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:52.500]  We'll let you know.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.500]  So now that the show is over, please go to iTunes.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:58.500]  Just like our buddy did at the start of the show, leave a comment, give me a five-star rating.
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:03.500]  What that does is it helps us move up into the ranks in iTunes.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:04.500]  More people see the show.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:05.500]  More people will listen to the show.
[01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:07.500]  More people will grow good cannabis.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.500]  It just goes in a cycle.
[01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:11.500]  The more people listen, the better.
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:12.500]  The herb's going to be everywhere.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:13.500]  Everywhere, you guys.
[01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:20.500]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every single episode is always and forever archived on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:24.500]  You guys, we did add a donation button to the podcast page a while back.
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.500]  I'm not trying to beg, but all you got to do is go to the iRegenetics Colorado website.

[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.500]  Click on that.
[01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.500]  It does go directly to my PayPal account.
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.500]  I'm never going to charge you for this podcast.
[01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:44.500]  I promise it's always going to be free, but if you want to make a contribution for my time and my energy, it would definitely be appreciated.

[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.500]  You guys, big shout-out to my ninja Spence.
[01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.500]  Thanks again for listening.
[01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.500]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[01:23:29.570 --> 01:23:31.570]  Yeah!
[01:23:31.570 --> 01:23:33.970]  Oh, my God.
[01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:34.970]  That was the best.
[01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:35.970]  Thank you.
[01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:36.970]  Do the rest.
[01:23:36.970 --> 01:23:37.970]  Keep going, dude.
[01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:39.970]  I don't listen to that.
[01:23:39.970 --> 01:23:40.970]  You don't know the intro?
[01:23:40.970 --> 01:23:41.970]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:42.970]  Oh, man.
[01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:45.970]  I come on, and then it's hard to listen to the rest because you're a grower.
[01:23:45.970 --> 01:23:46.970]  I'm going to—oh, I see.
[01:23:46.970 --> 01:23:50.970]  Hey, all you guys that are growers and stuff, it's Clint.
[01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:51.970]  I'm back.
[01:23:51.970 --> 01:23:53.970]  This is going to be a crazy episode.
[01:23:53.970 --> 01:23:54.970]  I can already tell.
[01:23:54.970 --> 01:23:55.970]  Yeah.
[01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:57.970]  Guys, it's time for 78 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:23:57.970 --> 01:23:58.970]  Yes.
[01:23:58.970 --> 01:24:00.970]  Yeah, 78.
[01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:03.970]  We're going to skip the intro because Clint already crashed the whole fucking party,
[01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:04.970]  and I like it.
[01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:05.970]  Damn straight.
[01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:07.970]  You said we might have one mishap at the start, and I was like,
[01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:09.970]  it's going to be a good mishap then.
[01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:12.970]  I'm going to make it 100%.
[01:24:12.970 --> 01:24:14.970]  You wouldn't believe how many false starts I've had on this podcast
[01:24:14.970 --> 01:24:15.970]  when I'm recording by myself.
[01:24:15.970 --> 01:24:18.970]  It seems like I have a really hard time busting out the intro when I'm alone,
[01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:21.970]  but when there are people here, it flows out like nothing.
[01:24:21.970 --> 01:24:22.970]  Yeah, like this time.
[01:24:22.970 --> 01:24:23.970]  You did a real good job.
[01:24:23.970 --> 01:24:24.970]  I did.
[01:24:24.970 --> 01:24:25.970]  Thanks.
[01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:26.970]  You didn't skip a single word.
[01:24:26.970 --> 01:24:29.970]  Man, you got everything you wanted to say out.
[01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:31.970]  I should have just turned your microphone down
[01:24:31.970 --> 01:24:33.970]  and just kept you down until I introduced you.
[01:24:33.970 --> 01:24:34.970]  I would have just kept yelling.
[01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:35.970]  I'm sure you would have.
[01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:36.970]  I would have just got even louder.
[01:24:36.970 --> 01:24:37.970]  So, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the show.
[01:24:37.970 --> 01:24:39.970]  Joining me today is my friend Clint.
[01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:40.970]  He's a local comedian.
[01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:41.970]  At least that's what he claims to be.
[01:24:41.970 --> 01:24:43.970]  You've already seen his skills.
[01:24:43.970 --> 01:24:44.970]  Yeah.
[01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:45.970]  It's fun, dude.
[01:24:45.970 --> 01:24:48.970]  Clint is an amateur pot smoker.
[01:24:48.970 --> 01:24:53.970]  He usually takes two puffs of sour diesel, and today he took three.
[01:24:53.970 --> 01:24:54.970]  Did I?
[01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:58.970]  It's still undecided because I can't remember if I took two or three.
[01:24:58.970 --> 01:25:01.970]  I hope you took three because you were fucking higher than usual.
[01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:02.970]  Yeah, dude.
[01:25:02.970 --> 01:25:03.970]  It was super fun.
[01:25:03.970 --> 01:25:04.970]  Nice.
[01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:05.970]  You okay?
[01:25:05.970 --> 01:25:06.970]  You going to be good?
[01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:07.970]  No, dude.
[01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:08.970]  Now we're here right now with all these people.
[01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:09.970]  This is fucking awesome.
[01:25:09.970 --> 01:25:10.970]  All these people.
[01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:11.970]  You mean all the people that are listening, right?
[01:25:11.970 --> 01:25:12.970]  Yeah.
[01:25:12.970 --> 01:25:13.970]  You don't think there are more people here, do you?
[01:25:13.970 --> 01:25:14.970]  Well, just the ones behind you.
[01:25:14.970 --> 01:25:15.970]  Uh-oh.
[01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:16.970]  All right, you guys.
[01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:18.970]  You can already tell what kind of episode this is going to be.
[01:25:18.970 --> 01:25:22.970]  I do need to send a huge thank you shout-out to Kat and Coot from the Mystic Roots Band.
[01:25:22.970 --> 01:25:23.970]  They let me play their music on the show.
[01:25:23.970 --> 01:25:24.970]  I really appreciate that.
[01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:25.970]  That's really super cool.
[01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:29.970]  I don't have any advertising to do at the start of this show.
[01:25:29.970 --> 01:25:31.970]  I already fucked it up anyway.
[01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:32.970]  No, no, dude.
[01:25:32.970 --> 01:25:33.970]  You don't fuck anything up.
[01:25:33.970 --> 01:25:34.970]  I like it when you're here.
[01:25:34.970 --> 01:25:35.970]  You break up the monotony.
[01:25:35.970 --> 01:25:36.970]  You make it explosively fun.
[01:25:36.970 --> 01:25:37.970]  You make it entertaining.
[01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:38.970]  You good?
[01:25:38.970 --> 01:25:39.970]  Sorry.
[01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:44.970]  Paul texted me and I accidentally looked at it.
[01:25:44.970 --> 01:25:46.970]  I missed all that.
[01:25:46.970 --> 01:25:48.970]  I missed everything you said.
[01:25:48.970 --> 01:25:50.970]  I'm a jerk.
[01:25:50.970 --> 01:25:52.970]  Clint's got what we've been referring to as goldfish brain.
[01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:53.970]  Fuck yeah.
[01:25:53.970 --> 01:25:55.970]  About every 30 seconds, Clint resets.
[01:25:55.970 --> 01:25:58.970]  Welcome to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:25:58.970 --> 01:25:59.970]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:25:59.970 --> 01:26:00.970]  See, he's back at the beginning again.
[01:26:00.970 --> 01:26:04.970]  So guys, the first thing that Clint and I want to do is review the Doug Benson album.
[01:26:04.970 --> 01:26:14.970]  On 4-20, Doug Benson came to Denver, Colorado, and he did three shows and recorded all three of them for his new comedy album,
[01:26:14.970 --> 01:26:19.970]  which was called Promotional Tool, and it came out just a few days ago here.
[01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:21.970]  I think it came out on the 5th.
[01:26:21.970 --> 01:26:23.970]  I think it was the 9th, but you're high, so it's okay.
[01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.970]  I was 5'9", not 9'5".
[01:26:25.970 --> 01:26:26.970]  That's cool.
[01:26:26.970 --> 01:26:27.970]  You'll be all right eventually.
[01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:28.970]  God, I hope this is funny.
[01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:29.970]  This is funny.
[01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:34.970]  If this is just me just being a fucking dick and your fans have to listen to it, I feel so bad.
[01:26:34.970 --> 01:26:36.970]  I'm having fun, so hopefully they will too.
[01:26:36.970 --> 01:26:40.970]  Do you get a certain percentage or do you know anybody in Pueblo listening?
[01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:42.970]  A lot of our Pueblo friends listen.
[01:26:42.970 --> 01:26:43.970]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:50.970]  Actually, I found out that Drew listens and that Joe listens.
[01:26:50.970 --> 01:26:53.970]  Joe and his friend that I just met, I want to call him Kevin.
[01:26:53.970 --> 01:26:54.970]  Joe and Kevin listen.
[01:26:54.970 --> 01:26:59.970]  I did not know that those guys listen, so shout out to Joe and Kevin that I recently saw on Baca's couch.
[01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:00.970]  Baca listens.
[01:27:00.970 --> 01:27:02.970]  Yeah, we get a lot of local listeners.
[01:27:02.970 --> 01:27:03.970]  Yeah.
[01:27:03.970 --> 01:27:04.970]  And Arnie listen.
[01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:05.970]  Mark has been listening.
[01:27:05.970 --> 01:27:06.970]  Shout out to Mark.
[01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:07.970]  He's finally paying attention.
[01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:11.970]  So let's make this a real big deal.
[01:27:11.970 --> 01:27:12.970]  You know what I mean?
[01:27:12.970 --> 01:27:15.970]  What if this podcast became a real big deal just in Pueblo?
[01:27:16.970 --> 01:27:25.970]  When a comedian would come down or when a band would come through, it would be cool for them to go get a little bit too high with Ross to Jeff.
[01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:28.970]  Like it's the morning radio show before the show?
[01:27:28.970 --> 01:27:31.970]  Kind of, but more so like it's a get for you.
[01:27:31.970 --> 01:27:35.970]  It's almost be like that.
[01:27:35.970 --> 01:27:37.970]  It would be great to have that radio show idea.
[01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:44.970]  So what you're saying is that since the Wild Cousins are presenting a comedy show with a man by the name of Sam Talent.
[01:27:44.970 --> 01:27:46.970]  The funniest man I've ever seen.
[01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:49.970]  On July 23rd, 2015 at the Rainbow Bar.
[01:27:49.970 --> 01:27:56.970]  Are you saying that maybe we should have Sam Talent come be on the podcast and be a little bit funny and we could talk to him about his cannabis experience?
[01:27:56.970 --> 01:27:58.970]  Maybe he's got a funny weed story.
[01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:59.970]  Is that what you're thinking we could do?
[01:27:59.970 --> 01:28:00.970]  You know what?
[01:28:00.970 --> 01:28:01.970]  Let me ask him.
[01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:02.970]  I will ask him.
[01:28:02.970 --> 01:28:03.970]  All right.
[01:28:03.970 --> 01:28:04.970]  And I would love for that to happen.
[01:28:04.970 --> 01:28:05.970]  All right.
[01:28:05.970 --> 01:28:06.970]  Well, you got to come too because I don't know the guy.
[01:28:06.970 --> 01:28:07.970]  All right, guys.
[01:28:07.970 --> 01:28:11.970]  So in the future, Clint is going to try to get a comedian by the name of Sam Talent on the show here.
[01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:16.970]  And then he's going to do a show at the Rainbow Bar, July 23rd, 2015.
[01:28:16.970 --> 01:28:19.970]  It is a free show, but donations are encouraged.
[01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:20.970]  Check it out.
[01:28:20.970 --> 01:28:21.970]  If you're listening to this show, show up.
[01:28:21.970 --> 01:28:23.970]  Pay $5 because that's what I feel you should do.
[01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:24.970]  The show will be worth $5.
[01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:25.970]  Pay $5.
[01:28:25.970 --> 01:28:27.970]  Don't go be a cheap ass.
[01:28:27.970 --> 01:28:28.970]  It's a free show.
[01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.970]  You look like a pimp if you throw down five for the free show.
[01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:31.970]  I think you should do it.
[01:28:31.970 --> 01:28:32.970]  For sure, dude.
[01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:33.970]  All right.
[01:28:33.970 --> 01:28:34.970]  That's a fun show.
[01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:39.970]  That's got my buddy Paul Rosales and my other buddy John Blaino on that show.
[01:28:39.970 --> 01:28:42.970]  And that is my little comedy crew called the Wild Cousins.
[01:28:42.970 --> 01:28:43.970]  Shout out to the Wild Cousins.
[01:28:43.970 --> 01:28:44.970]  Appreciate it, brother.
[01:28:44.970 --> 01:28:48.970]  I was wearing my Wild Cousins shirt yesterday, and people like to give me the weirdest looks.
[01:28:48.970 --> 01:28:49.970]  I love it, dude.
[01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:51.970]  The shirt has a kitty cat shooting an assault rifle.
[01:28:51.970 --> 01:28:56.970]  And definitely, I'm a 6'5 dude with dreadlocks, and people look at me with great confusion.
[01:28:56.970 --> 01:28:57.970]  It's just such a weird shirt.
[01:28:57.970 --> 01:28:58.970]  I don't know.
[01:28:58.970 --> 01:28:59.970]  I love it.
[01:28:59.970 --> 01:29:02.970]  We got a whole bunch of them, and we just have never tried to sell them.
[01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.970]  It's so fun that we just gave up on them immediately.
[01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:10.970]  I'm thinking about getting Grow From Your Heart podcast t-shirts made here eventually.
[01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:11.970]  I'd rock one of those.
[01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:14.970]  Hopefully, by episode 100, I'll be able to give a couple of them away.
[01:29:14.970 --> 01:29:15.970]  You should talk to Barrett.
[01:29:15.970 --> 01:29:16.970]  Shout out to Barrett.
[01:29:16.970 --> 01:29:17.970]  Yes.
[01:29:17.970 --> 01:29:18.970]  Shout out to Barrett.
[01:29:18.970 --> 01:29:19.970]  Is that Last Leaf?
[01:29:19.970 --> 01:29:20.970]  Does he work there?
[01:29:20.970 --> 01:29:21.970]  Last Leaf, I think, is Moe.
[01:29:21.970 --> 01:29:22.970]  Moe, okay.
[01:29:22.970 --> 01:29:23.970]  Yes.
[01:29:23.970 --> 01:29:24.970]  I thought they were together.
[01:29:24.970 --> 01:29:25.970]  They are not.
[01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:26.970]  Moe's not doing shirts, though.
[01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:29.970]  Moe does, like, I think, unless Barrett bought up Moe's shit, and they just call it the same thing.
[01:29:29.970 --> 01:29:30.970]  All right.
[01:29:30.970 --> 01:29:31.970]  So, this just got real local.
[01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:32.970]  What's up, guys?
[01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:34.970]  We're going to go back to talking about funny weed shit.
[01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:35.970]  So, we went and saw Doug Benson.
[01:29:35.970 --> 01:29:36.970]  Yes.
[01:29:36.970 --> 01:29:37.970]  On 420, we saw Doug Benson.
[01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:39.970]  He did three shows at the Comedy Works.
[01:29:39.970 --> 01:29:40.970]  Shout out to Comedy Works.
[01:29:40.970 --> 01:29:41.970]  That's my favorite comedy club on the planet.
[01:29:41.970 --> 01:29:42.970]  For sure.
[01:29:42.970 --> 01:29:43.970]  Really quickly, I owe a shout out to Baker.
[01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:49.970]  Baker was watching my Periscope broadcast last night and having a conversation with me, and I was slightly honored.
[01:29:49.970 --> 01:29:51.970]  I like that guy.
[01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:52.970]  Dude, Baker's a good dude.
[01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:54.970]  He came out and shook my hand the other day.
[01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:58.970]  I recognized him, and I waved at him, and he recognized me, probably because I'm fucking ridiculous looking.
[01:29:58.970 --> 01:30:00.970]  It's the tall thing.
[01:30:00.970 --> 01:30:01.970]  It's the tall thing.
[01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:02.970]  Yeah, but I go, Hey, Baker.
[01:30:02.970 --> 01:30:03.970]  Thanks, man.
[01:30:04.970 --> 01:30:05.970]  That was after the show.
[01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:06.970]  Cool.
[01:30:06.970 --> 01:30:08.970]  Because we had actually moved pretty fast.
[01:30:08.970 --> 01:30:10.970]  I'm getting rambly again.
[01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:11.970]  That's all right.
[01:30:11.970 --> 01:30:12.970]  You're nice.
[01:30:12.970 --> 01:30:13.970]  I'm super high, dude.
[01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:14.970]  But Baker's fucking cool as shit.
[01:30:14.970 --> 01:30:20.970]  Guys, this is great because I've never seen Clint this high, and he's almost uncomfortably high, and I can see him resituate himself every few minutes.
[01:30:20.970 --> 01:30:26.970]  So, it's great, and that's going to lead into something that we're going to talk about in a little bit here, too, if we have time, because Clint keeps talking a lot.
[01:30:26.970 --> 01:30:27.970]  So, I feel like you're-
[01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:29.970]  Shit, four episodes later.
[01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:31.970]  Yes.
[01:30:32.970 --> 01:30:35.970]  I was going to make a reference, and then I forgot the dude's name, so we won't even do it.
[01:30:35.970 --> 01:30:40.970]  It feels like you are Pete Holmes-ing me.
[01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:41.970]  That's what's happening here.
[01:30:41.970 --> 01:30:42.970]  I'm being Pete Holmes-ed.
[01:30:42.970 --> 01:30:47.970]  If you ever watch any of Doug Benson's podcast, Pete Holmes will love to just interrupt and drag on.
[01:30:47.970 --> 01:30:48.970]  Just 100%.
[01:30:48.970 --> 01:30:49.970]  Yes.
[01:30:49.970 --> 01:30:50.970]  You're Pete Holmes-ing me.
[01:30:50.970 --> 01:30:56.970]  So, we're going to do a little- On 420, Doug came and did those comedy shows, right, at Comedy Works.
[01:30:56.970 --> 01:31:03.970]  Clint and I and a couple other people had the honor of going to the third show that night, which may have been a mistake.
[01:31:03.970 --> 01:31:05.970]  And we've talked about that on the podcast before.
[01:31:05.970 --> 01:31:06.970]  Yes.
[01:31:06.970 --> 01:31:07.970]  Yes, we did.
[01:31:07.970 --> 01:31:12.970]  So, we downloaded the CD on the day that it came out, and we listened to it.
[01:31:12.970 --> 01:31:19.970]  And so, the fun part that I noticed right away is he used the opening from the show we attended.
[01:31:19.970 --> 01:31:20.970]  For sure, he did.
[01:31:20.970 --> 01:31:23.970]  Yeah, because he talks about how he was trying to get too high.
[01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:24.970]  Oh, dude.
[01:31:24.970 --> 01:31:26.970]  Well, yeah, that was definite.
[01:31:26.970 --> 01:31:28.970]  And it's not like he could have done that twice.
[01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:29.970]  No.
[01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:33.970]  But even later in the album, you can hear him, and he's not that high.
[01:31:33.970 --> 01:31:34.970]  Right.
[01:31:34.970 --> 01:31:37.970]  And it's just like, oh, man, I wish I'd have went to those other shows.
[01:31:37.970 --> 01:31:38.970]  Right.
[01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:42.970]  There were a couple of pieces that I'm certain came from our show.
[01:31:42.970 --> 01:31:46.970]  And then I know that there's some that are like, oh, he did not do that at our show because he sounds awake.
[01:31:46.970 --> 01:31:54.970]  But one of my favorite parts of the entire album is that on track one, there are multiple times when I can hear Clint over laughing.
[01:31:54.970 --> 01:31:56.970]  Clint is like a dick.
[01:31:56.970 --> 01:31:58.970]  Oh, no, it's great, dude, because it's genuine.
[01:31:58.970 --> 01:31:59.970]  But you're laughing.
[01:31:59.970 --> 01:32:04.970]  You're such a big dude, and your laugh is so low that it just shakes the entire comedy club when you laugh.
[01:32:04.970 --> 01:32:08.970]  And we're in the front row in that little pit area, and there's a lot of sound right there.
[01:32:08.970 --> 01:32:10.970]  And dude, you're coming through on the mic so well.
[01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:14.970]  And you can just hear Clint like, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:17.970]  It's so fucking funny hearing your buddy laugh on a comedy album.
[01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:18.970]  That's pretty cool.
[01:32:18.970 --> 01:32:19.970]  It was great.
[01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:23.970]  Now, the shitty thing is the comedy album, not that funny.
[01:32:23.970 --> 01:32:24.970]  You know what?
[01:32:24.970 --> 01:32:25.970]  Doug's my friend.
[01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:26.970]  You know what sucks?
[01:32:26.970 --> 01:32:28.970]  I might have been the funniest thing on that album.
[01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:31.970]  You're the funniest thing on that album.
[01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:33.970]  Please don't tell Doug Benson I said that.
[01:32:33.970 --> 01:32:35.970]  I think Ball Weed might be the funniest thing on that album.
[01:32:35.970 --> 01:32:37.970]  God, he would hate me.
[01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:38.970]  He might, but you know what?
[01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:39.970]  You're being honest.
[01:32:39.970 --> 01:32:41.970]  No, I just didn't think it was that good.
[01:32:41.970 --> 01:32:44.970]  We went and saw that show, and I had a prejudice against it already, though.
[01:32:44.970 --> 01:32:45.970]  You know what I mean?
[01:32:45.970 --> 01:32:47.970]  Because I was already a little mad at him.
[01:32:47.970 --> 01:32:53.970]  So the first track is 25 minutes of Doug reading tweets on his comedy album.
[01:32:53.970 --> 01:32:56.970]  I know that's what he does in his live show, but...
[01:32:56.970 --> 01:32:58.970]  He's just riffing off of them.
[01:32:58.970 --> 01:33:01.970]  Yeah, if I was going to do a comedy album, if I were a comedian, I would put together,
[01:33:01.970 --> 01:33:03.970]  I would Joe Rogan that bitch.
[01:33:03.970 --> 01:33:06.970]  I would put together the tightest one hour that I could come...
[01:33:06.970 --> 01:33:10.970]  And it might take you two years to do it, but you're real happy to do it like that.
[01:33:10.970 --> 01:33:11.970]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:33:11.970 --> 01:33:12.970]  Fuck, man.
[01:33:12.970 --> 01:33:15.970]  So the first album is 25 minutes of him reading tweets.
[01:33:15.970 --> 01:33:16.970]  I think I'm...
[01:33:16.970 --> 01:33:17.970]  The second or the first track.
[01:33:17.970 --> 01:33:20.970]  The second track is called Watch This, Not That, where he plays a game that he normally
[01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:21.970]  plays on his podcast.
[01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:22.970]  For free.
[01:33:22.970 --> 01:33:23.970]  For free.
[01:33:23.970 --> 01:33:28.970]  And it felt like I paid $5 to download a podcast, basically, because I listen to his podcast
[01:33:28.970 --> 01:33:30.970]  frequently, and it didn't feel any better than that.
[01:33:30.970 --> 01:33:36.970]  That son of a bitch turned 50 on us, and all of a sudden he became a money-hungry fucking
[01:33:36.970 --> 01:33:37.970]  capitalist.
[01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:38.970]  He doesn't even smoke weed.
[01:33:38.970 --> 01:33:39.970]  This is all a ruse.
[01:33:39.970 --> 01:33:40.970]  Oh, no, no.
[01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:41.970]  He is...
[01:33:41.970 --> 01:33:42.970]  He doesn't smoke.
[01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:43.970]  He doesn't smoke.
[01:33:43.970 --> 01:33:44.970]  Nope.
[01:33:44.970 --> 01:33:45.970]  All right.
[01:33:45.970 --> 01:33:46.970]  So anyway, about this album.
[01:33:46.970 --> 01:33:51.970]  Yeah, the album, like I was saying, the first track is reading tweets.
[01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:56.970]  The second track is talking about something that he normally does on his podcast.
[01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:00.970]  Then he actually tells a joke, and then he tells a couple more jokes, and then he promotes
[01:34:00.970 --> 01:34:05.970]  his other podcast, and then he promotes another podcast, and then he promotes his other podcast,
[01:34:05.970 --> 01:34:09.970]  and then he talks about traveling, and then he actually does a really good joke.
[01:34:09.970 --> 01:34:13.970]  It's not a well-put-together album, and that sucks, because Doug's one of my favorite people.
[01:34:13.970 --> 01:34:14.970]  He's my friend.
[01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:15.970]  I call Doug my friend.
[01:34:15.970 --> 01:34:16.970]  He knows who I am.
[01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:17.970]  We contact each other.
[01:34:17.970 --> 01:34:21.970]  And to see one of your friends put something out like that, it's almost like, oh, man,
[01:34:21.970 --> 01:34:24.970]  you could have done a little harder on that.
[01:34:24.970 --> 01:34:29.970]  Most comedy albums, the comedian will start with a decent story, and then tell you a couple
[01:34:29.970 --> 01:34:33.970]  jokes, and then by the time you've forgotten about that first story, he'll tell you another
[01:34:33.970 --> 01:34:37.970]  part that reminds you of that, that refers to that to make you laugh.
[01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.970]  Doug has already forgotten the first part of his act by the time he's 20 minutes in.
[01:34:40.970 --> 01:34:41.970]  He can't do a callback.
[01:34:41.970 --> 01:34:43.970]  That's what I'm doing right now.
[01:34:43.970 --> 01:34:44.970]  We got Clint too high today.
[01:34:44.970 --> 01:34:45.970]  Clint got himself too high.
[01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:46.970]  Sorry, guys.
[01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:47.970]  That's all right.
[01:34:47.970 --> 01:34:49.970]  This podcast sucks.
[01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:53.970]  If you could give Doug Benson's album ... The podcast doesn't suck, bro.
[01:34:53.970 --> 01:34:54.970]  We're going to make it rock.
[01:34:54.970 --> 01:34:59.970]  If you could give Doug Benson's album up to five pot leaves, a scale of one to five pot
[01:34:59.970 --> 01:35:01.970]  leaves, how many leaves are you going to give him?
[01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:03.970]  He's going to get one pot leaf.
[01:35:03.970 --> 01:35:04.970]  He's going to get one pot leaf.
[01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:08.970]  See, I'll give him two, maybe two and a half or three, but it definitely was not a four
[01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:09.970]  or five star performance.
[01:35:09.970 --> 01:35:13.970]  Yeah, he's your friend, and I think you're being generous.
[01:35:13.970 --> 01:35:22.970]  I think I'm being mean too, but there's just so many ... There's so much to do out there
[01:35:22.970 --> 01:35:23.970]  now.
[01:35:23.970 --> 01:35:24.970]  I could download anything.
[01:35:24.970 --> 01:35:25.970]  Yeah.
[01:35:26.970 --> 01:35:33.970]  That album right there is my only introduction to Doug Benson.
[01:35:33.970 --> 01:35:37.970]  That's the only thing I know of him other than his podcast.
[01:35:37.970 --> 01:35:38.970]  Yeah.
[01:35:38.970 --> 01:35:44.970]  I am the perfect demographic to go, dude, I'm not a cult follower, so I'm mad that I
[01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:45.970]  bought this.
[01:35:45.970 --> 01:35:48.970]  I'm mad that I went to that show a little bit.
[01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:52.970]  Yeah, those 25 bucks that you've spent on being disappointed twice now.
[01:35:52.970 --> 01:35:53.970]  Yeah.
[01:35:53.970 --> 01:35:54.970]  Okay.
[01:35:55.970 --> 01:35:57.970]  Yeah, that's why you're disappointed.
[01:35:57.970 --> 01:35:58.970]  You're paying $25 on a hooker.
[01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:59.970]  God damn it, dude.
[01:35:59.970 --> 01:36:00.970]  That's got to be the problem.
[01:36:00.970 --> 01:36:01.970]  I am not getting any in.
[01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:02.970]  You need to upgrade.
[01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:03.970]  Jesus Christ.
[01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:04.970]  You're getting $25 hookers, man.
[01:36:04.970 --> 01:36:05.970]  That's your problem.
[01:36:05.970 --> 01:36:06.970]  All right, so we're going to move on from Doug.
[01:36:06.970 --> 01:36:08.970]  Hey, Doug, sorry I had to bash your album, dude.
[01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:09.970]  Sorry, man.
[01:36:09.970 --> 01:36:11.970]  You got to put it together more.
[01:36:11.970 --> 01:36:12.970]  I still like you.
[01:36:12.970 --> 01:36:14.970]  Yeah, I still love you, bro.
[01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:16.970]  I'm going to come to your show on the 5th of July.
[01:36:16.970 --> 01:36:18.970]  I'll see you there at the Comedy Works in Denver.
[01:36:18.970 --> 01:36:19.970]  I've already got tickets.
[01:36:19.970 --> 01:36:20.970]  I'm not sure that Clint wants to go.
[01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:21.970]  Yeah, I'm not going.
[01:36:22.970 --> 01:36:24.970]  I got someone else I could take.
[01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:25.970]  But I'll be there, Doug.
[01:36:25.970 --> 01:36:26.970]  Don't worry.
[01:36:26.970 --> 01:36:27.970]  I just wasn't.
[01:36:27.970 --> 01:36:29.970]  I like the way that Proops put together a comedy album.
[01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:31.970]  I like the way Ari put together a comedy album.
[01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:37.970]  It's got more continuity is the word I'm looking for.
[01:36:37.970 --> 01:36:38.970]  It flows a little bit better.
[01:36:38.970 --> 01:36:39.970]  Yeah.
[01:36:39.970 --> 01:36:41.970]  And I'd prefer that out of a comedy album.
[01:36:41.970 --> 01:36:42.970]  Did you watch that Bill Burr album?
[01:36:42.970 --> 01:36:43.970]  You know, I did see that one.
[01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:44.970]  Dude.
[01:36:44.970 --> 01:36:45.970]  The black and white one?
[01:36:45.970 --> 01:36:46.970]  Yeah.
[01:36:46.970 --> 01:36:47.970]  What's it called?
[01:36:47.970 --> 01:36:49.970]  Shit, I don't remember now, but that was great.
[01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:51.970]  Yeah, that's what I expect out of a comedy album.
[01:36:51.970 --> 01:36:52.970]  That's a little bit better.
[01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:57.970]  That's hard to be like, all right, well, here's this guy who's perfect at this.
[01:36:57.970 --> 01:36:59.970]  Like, that's Bill Burr to me.
[01:36:59.970 --> 01:37:00.970]  He's perfect at it.
[01:37:00.970 --> 01:37:03.970]  He works so hard at it.
[01:37:03.970 --> 01:37:07.970]  And it's so exciting to watch somebody be perfect at something.
[01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:09.970]  Anthony Jezelnik is damn near perfect at it.
[01:37:09.970 --> 01:37:14.970]  See, it's just, I think that Jezelnik has his routine.
[01:37:15.970 --> 01:37:19.970]  But Bill Burr could just go off on anything.
[01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:20.970]  Okay.
[01:37:20.970 --> 01:37:21.970]  It's fucking lovely.
[01:37:21.970 --> 01:37:23.970]  It's so beautiful to watch.
[01:37:23.970 --> 01:37:30.970]  And so most of those bits that he has, he's kind of half improvising as he's telling the joke.
[01:37:30.970 --> 01:37:34.970]  He knows how long and what beats he wants to hit, but it's not like that regimented,
[01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:37.970]  I say it like this, Jezelnik kind of way.
[01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:39.970]  And Jezelnik is kind of a robot in that.
[01:37:39.970 --> 01:37:42.970]  Well, you've said it plenty of times, like he counts.
[01:37:42.970 --> 01:37:43.970]  Yeah, he counts.
[01:37:43.970 --> 01:37:46.970]  I can see his throat moving when he counts.
[01:37:46.970 --> 01:37:48.970]  Yeah, and I can see him say the word 11.
[01:37:48.970 --> 01:37:49.970]  Yeah.
[01:37:49.970 --> 01:37:51.970]  But that's what I'm saying is like he.
[01:37:51.970 --> 01:37:55.970]  Bill Burr can go in there and do his routine and then break away and do some dance moves
[01:37:55.970 --> 01:37:57.970]  and then go back to the routine.
[01:37:57.970 --> 01:37:59.970]  And I love that about a comedian.
[01:37:59.970 --> 01:38:00.970]  Proofs has that ability as well.
[01:38:00.970 --> 01:38:02.970]  Oh, he's so fucking smart.
[01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:03.970]  Yeah.
[01:38:03.970 --> 01:38:04.970]  Jesus.
[01:38:04.970 --> 01:38:07.970]  Well, when we were talking to him, when he smacked you that day, about that story,
[01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:08.970]  it was just so much fun.
[01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:10.970]  Just being in the room with him was fun.
[01:38:10.970 --> 01:38:12.970]  Yeah, he's got that storyteller personality.
[01:38:12.970 --> 01:38:14.970]  They need to get Greg Proops on.
[01:38:14.970 --> 01:38:15.970]  This is not happening.
[01:38:15.970 --> 01:38:16.970]  That would be fucking awesome.
[01:38:16.970 --> 01:38:17.970]  That'd be fun, dude.
[01:38:17.970 --> 01:38:19.970]  Yeah, season three or two is coming out pretty soon.
[01:38:19.970 --> 01:38:20.970]  All right, we're way off topic.
[01:38:20.970 --> 01:38:21.970]  We're rambling, but that's all right.
[01:38:21.970 --> 01:38:22.970]  Clint's coming back around.
[01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:24.970]  I can feel him connecting a little more.
[01:38:24.970 --> 01:38:25.970]  Yeah.
[01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:27.970]  The goldfish in his brain is not swimming in such short circles.
[01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:29.970]  The laps have gotten larger.
[01:38:29.970 --> 01:38:30.970]  I got sweetie birds now.
[01:38:30.970 --> 01:38:32.970]  They're going around my head.
[01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:34.970]  He upgraded the squirrel that runs on the cage.
[01:38:34.970 --> 01:38:35.970]  He'll be back pretty soon.
[01:38:35.970 --> 01:38:36.970]  Yeah.
[01:38:36.970 --> 01:38:37.970]  All right.
[01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:38.970]  I gave him a smoke break.
[01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:39.970]  Get it?
[01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:42.970]  Fucking dude.
[01:38:42.970 --> 01:38:44.970]  See, you're getting almost funny.
[01:38:44.970 --> 01:38:45.970]  That was pretty fucking dumb.
[01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:46.970]  You're getting almost funny.
[01:38:46.970 --> 01:38:47.970]  That was good.
[01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:48.970]  I almost tried to talk over it, but then I was like,
[01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:50.970]  we got to give him credit for that one.
[01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:53.970]  Somebody sent me a Facebook message,
[01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:56.970]  and it was a good question for Clint,
[01:38:56.970 --> 01:38:59.970]  because they said, how much should I be smoking?
[01:38:59.970 --> 01:39:00.970]  Oh.
[01:39:00.970 --> 01:39:01.970]  Yeah.
[01:39:01.970 --> 01:39:02.970]  One.
[01:39:02.970 --> 01:39:03.970]  One, yeah.
[01:39:03.970 --> 01:39:04.970]  Today, Clint should have only taken one.
[01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:05.970]  Yeah, it seems like it.
[01:39:06.970 --> 01:39:08.970]  That's the beauty of cannabis.
[01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:10.970]  If you're using medical marijuana,
[01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:13.970]  the beauty of it is that it's up to you.
[01:39:13.970 --> 01:39:16.970]  That's why you have chosen to medicate yourself with medical marijuana,
[01:39:16.970 --> 01:39:19.970]  because some doctor isn't saying take two of these every so often.
[01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:24.970]  It's up to you to figure out how many puffs off of this bowl
[01:39:24.970 --> 01:39:28.970]  or how much of this joint I need to smoke to ease my medical condition.
[01:39:28.970 --> 01:39:30.970]  And then you want to, you're going to have to,
[01:39:30.970 --> 01:39:34.970]  I guess if you've never smoked, light up a joint and take two puffs.
[01:39:35.970 --> 01:39:36.970]  And then see how that does.
[01:39:36.970 --> 01:39:38.970]  If that's way too much next time, only take one.
[01:39:38.970 --> 01:39:40.970]  If that didn't do it, take three next time.
[01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:41.970]  Make a smaller joint.
[01:39:41.970 --> 01:39:42.970]  Yeah.
[01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:44.970]  Roll a smaller joint and don't get as high.
[01:39:44.970 --> 01:39:48.970]  But it's hard for me to tell you how much you should be smoking,
[01:39:48.970 --> 01:39:53.970]  because I just watched Clint take three hits off of a bowl of some pretty
[01:39:53.970 --> 01:39:55.970]  high-grade sour diesel, and he is high.
[01:39:55.970 --> 01:39:57.970]  And Jeff took two.
[01:39:57.970 --> 01:39:58.970]  I took two.
[01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:59.970]  And then two fucking dabs.
[01:39:59.970 --> 01:40:01.970]  And I'm about to take another dab.
[01:40:01.970 --> 01:40:02.970]  Like fucking dabs.
[01:40:03.970 --> 01:40:04.970]  Well, I know.
[01:40:04.970 --> 01:40:05.970]  Dabs are my friend.
[01:40:05.970 --> 01:40:06.970]  Clint says dabs are drugs.
[01:40:06.970 --> 01:40:07.970]  Drugs.
[01:40:07.970 --> 01:40:08.970]  I can see why he says that.
[01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:10.970]  But it's all about what you need.
[01:40:10.970 --> 01:40:13.970]  Are you smoking to medicate yourself?
[01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:17.970]  If you're smoking to prevent seizures, smoke as much as you want.
[01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:18.970]  Dude.
[01:40:18.970 --> 01:40:19.970]  Smoke all day.
[01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:23.970]  Well, it's really just smoke until you're comfortable.
[01:40:23.970 --> 01:40:24.970]  Yeah.
[01:40:24.970 --> 01:40:28.970]  As long as you're smoking isn't hindering your ability to be a productive person,
[01:40:28.970 --> 01:40:32.970]  as long as it's not causing you a financial problem, a health problem,
[01:40:32.970 --> 01:40:36.970]  a mental problem, a motivational problem, a relationship problem.
[01:40:36.970 --> 01:40:37.970]  Yeah, for sure.
[01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:40.970]  As long as you're not using it as a crutch,
[01:40:40.970 --> 01:40:44.970]  as long as it's not an anchor or something negative,
[01:40:44.970 --> 01:40:47.970]  as long as it's not causing a problem is my point here.
[01:40:47.970 --> 01:40:49.970]  Smoke as much as you feel comfortable with.
[01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:52.970]  I don't recommend every day trying to see how high you can get.
[01:40:52.970 --> 01:40:56.970]  You don't need to be Joey Diaz and try to see the fucking devil every day.
[01:40:56.970 --> 01:40:58.970]  I don't know why people want to do that.
[01:40:58.970 --> 01:40:59.970]  But try it once.
[01:40:59.970 --> 01:41:00.970]  Why not?
[01:41:00.970 --> 01:41:02.970]  Just push the limit.
[01:41:02.970 --> 01:41:03.970]  Nope.
[01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:04.970]  Okay.
[01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:06.970]  Well, that's the thing is because I'm comfortable.
[01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:07.970]  You kind of are pushing though.
[01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:08.970]  That third one was your limit.
[01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:09.970]  You're kind of pushing it now.
[01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:10.970]  Okay.
[01:41:10.970 --> 01:41:11.970]  That was okay.
[01:41:11.970 --> 01:41:12.970]  Yeah.
[01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:13.970]  Pushing the limit, but not like going to see the devil.
[01:41:13.970 --> 01:41:14.970]  No, no.
[01:41:14.970 --> 01:41:15.970]  Yeah.
[01:41:15.970 --> 01:41:16.970]  Don't get cross-eyed and don't take seven dabs your first try.
[01:41:16.970 --> 01:41:17.970]  See, that's what I get.
[01:41:17.970 --> 01:41:20.970]  That fucking peer pressure is a motherfucker though.
[01:41:20.970 --> 01:41:21.970]  You know what I mean?
[01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:22.970]  Like not at our age,
[01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:28.970]  but I remember like when we were like 16, 18, I would have done anything.
[01:41:28.970 --> 01:41:29.970]  Anything.
[01:41:29.970 --> 01:41:30.970]  Yeah.
[01:41:30.970 --> 01:41:32.970]  Like if you wanted for you to think I was cool, I would have done anything.
[01:41:32.970 --> 01:41:34.970]  I would have stabbed the motherfucker.
[01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:36.970]  Especially if I was going to get laid at the end.
[01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:39.970]  Oh, dude, if I could get laid at, I didn't get laid until I was 18.
[01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:44.970]  And because I was just a late bloomer, but I'm just a skinny fucking white kid.
[01:41:44.970 --> 01:41:46.970]  I was just, it's okay.
[01:41:46.970 --> 01:41:48.970]  You made up for it.
[01:41:48.970 --> 01:41:49.970]  I'm doing okay now.
[01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:50.970]  Yeah.
[01:41:50.970 --> 01:41:55.970]  But it's just, it's weird to see that fucking goldfish reset.
[01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:56.970]  Yep.
[01:41:56.970 --> 01:41:57.970]  Here he goes.
[01:41:57.970 --> 01:41:58.970]  New thought process for Clint.
[01:41:58.970 --> 01:41:59.970]  Want to go for a bike ride, buddy?
[01:41:59.970 --> 01:42:00.970]  Thanks, buddy.
[01:42:00.970 --> 01:42:01.970]  He gets that ADD.
[01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:02.970]  I did lose it, buddy.
[01:42:02.970 --> 01:42:03.970]  Sorry.
[01:42:03.970 --> 01:42:04.970]  No, I got your back.
[01:42:04.970 --> 01:42:05.970]  I'm the host.
[01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:06.970]  I'm paying attention.
[01:42:06.970 --> 01:42:07.970]  No edits.
[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:08.970]  I'm leaving all that.
[01:42:08.970 --> 01:42:09.970]  I'm leaving all your rambles in today.
[01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:10.970]  You get to deal with this.
[01:42:10.970 --> 01:42:11.970]  That's your punishment.
[01:42:11.970 --> 01:42:12.970]  You get to listen back to yourself.
[01:42:12.970 --> 01:42:13.970]  I'm into that.
[01:42:13.970 --> 01:42:14.970]  I will too.
[01:42:14.970 --> 01:42:15.970]  And I'll be like, that guy's pretty cool.
[01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:16.970]  Yeah.
[01:42:16.970 --> 01:42:17.970]  Whoever was on the show that day was fucking great.
[01:42:17.970 --> 01:42:18.970]  Yeah.
[01:42:18.970 --> 01:42:19.970]  So like Clint, maybe only needed two today.
[01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:20.970]  Oh, going to see the devil.
[01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:21.970]  That's what it was.
[01:42:21.970 --> 01:42:22.970]  Going to see the devil.
[01:42:22.970 --> 01:42:23.970]  Yeah.
[01:42:23.970 --> 01:42:24.970]  Don't do that every day, but do it once in a while if you need to.
[01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:25.970]  If you want to see what's on the other side of that wall, take another dab or take another
[01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:26.970]  puff off of the bowl and see what happens.
[01:42:26.970 --> 01:42:27.970]  I'm going to take a puff off of this dab rig right here.
[01:42:27.970 --> 01:42:28.970]  I'm smoking some Girl Scout cookies made by the Turpex crew.
[01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:29.970]  I picked it up at Green and Healthy Wellness in Colorado Springs.
[01:42:29.970 --> 01:42:30.970]  Shout out to the Grimy Gatsby.
[01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:31.970]  Shout out to Damsel.
[01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:32.970]  Hello, beautiful.
[01:42:32.970 --> 01:42:33.970]  And also shout out to John Randall's Jr.
[01:42:33.970 --> 01:42:34.970]  John Randall's Jr.
[01:42:34.970 --> 01:42:35.970]  I'm going to take a dab, but we need to get Clint in here.
[01:42:35.970 --> 01:42:36.970]  I'm going to take a dab.
[01:42:48.970 --> 01:43:09.970]  I'm going to take a dab.
[01:43:40.970 --> 01:43:41.970]  It's good, because I've heard them on a bunch of other shows.
[01:43:41.970 --> 01:43:42.970]  I got to get them.
[01:43:42.970 --> 01:43:43.970]  They're really funny.
[01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:44.970]  It's funny when Jeff's come down a couple of times, I got friends to come down and it's
[01:43:44.970 --> 01:43:46.730]  real fun, and we don't charge anybody.
[01:43:46.730 --> 01:43:48.210]  It's free you guys.
[01:43:48.210 --> 01:43:49.210]  Yeah.
[01:43:49.210 --> 01:43:50.910]  So it's, I mean, you can buy alcohol if you want.
[01:43:50.910 --> 01:43:52.110]  You can just come in and sit around.
[01:43:52.110 --> 01:43:53.050]  Like I don't drink.
[01:43:53.050 --> 01:43:54.050]  I don't drink.
[01:43:54.050 --> 01:43:55.050]  They don't ask me to buy anything.
[01:43:55.050 --> 01:43:57.750]  They don't expect anything of you if you don't drink.
[01:43:57.750 --> 01:44:04.470]  If you're there for the comedy, you might've brought somebody that was able to drink.
[01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:07.790]  That's all they ... like we're trying to bring business into the rainbow and get people
[01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:09.390]  in front of us.
[01:44:09.390 --> 01:44:15.310]  once every three months? Oh no, I'm not you. Once or twice a month is my goal. Once or twice a month.
[01:44:15.310 --> 01:44:19.310]  I'm not even asking that. Do you know what I mean? Like I'm just wanting once every three months out
[01:44:19.310 --> 01:44:24.430]  of just one of my friends, you know, and, and you hear the sadness in his voice, you guys,
[01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:29.230]  he just sucks. Cause like last night we went to go on. It's a, we, we were going to do it last
[01:44:29.230 --> 01:44:34.430]  night. Today's Thursday, but we were going to do one last night and no one showed up and it
[01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:39.870]  fucking broke my heart too. It's just, we get all everything all set up to go bartender sitting
[01:44:39.870 --> 01:44:44.750]  there, you know, 10 o'clock comes around and nobody's there. That's a bummer. I've been in
[01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:49.070]  bands for several years and I've played to the bartender for several shows and it's almost
[01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:52.590]  practice, you know? So we didn't even fucking do anything cause we're just like, nah, dude,
[01:44:52.590 --> 01:44:56.670]  I don't, I don't want to fucking do this. Yeah. I don't want to perform to Paul. Yeah. And then
[01:44:56.670 --> 01:45:03.230]  I just realized I'm just like a fucking weird old guy that's like hanging out in bars, not even
[01:45:04.190 --> 01:45:08.510]  drinking, not even drinking, smoking weed in the back of fucking bars. All right. So come out to
[01:45:08.510 --> 01:45:12.750]  the open mic night you guys, because if you don't, uh, they might, uh, not let us keep doing it.
[01:45:13.550 --> 01:45:18.830]  Yeah. That's, that's a real thing. Like, uh, we're the only Pueblo open mic and, uh,
[01:45:20.190 --> 01:45:25.790]  it's, it's going to go away. So we can't even get like other stuff going on because we can't get
[01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:29.310]  anybody to this one. So support local comedy guys, because if you don't support things,
[01:45:29.310 --> 01:45:32.270]  they go away. And then one day you'll be like, Hey, remember that comedy group? Let's go there.
[01:45:32.270 --> 01:45:35.710]  And there won't even fucking exist because you blew it off for too long. So support the local
[01:45:35.710 --> 01:45:40.270]  comedy, uh, as to how much you should be smoking. I'm done taking my dad now so I can rant about
[01:45:40.270 --> 01:45:45.470]  that. Uh, smoke until you're comfortably high. Uh, I have, there've been days and this sound,
[01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:48.590]  you guys are going to think I'm crazy. There've been days when I've smoked a gram or two by
[01:45:48.590 --> 01:45:54.910]  myself, like started a fresh gram. When I woke up, got done with it, started another gram and
[01:45:54.910 --> 01:45:59.390]  finished that one by myself throughout, throughout the course of a day. And you would think those
[01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:02.910]  are days when I'm sitting around not doing shit, but those are actually the days when I'm doing
[01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:08.350]  the most. Yeah. I don't know how I do it, but I'll stop and take four or five fat dads and go right
[01:46:08.350 --> 01:46:13.470]  back to work, work for an hour or two, take four or five more dads, go right back to work. Uh,
[01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:17.470]  yeah. Cause you're busy and you got your mind going. So like the high doesn't stick around
[01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:22.510]  as much, at least like you're using it though. You know how at the end of the day, your back
[01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:25.950]  hurts and you're all sore. If you've been doing work, I don't get that because I've been dabbing
[01:46:25.950 --> 01:46:30.270]  all day. Like my body doesn't even, my muscles stay loose and relaxed. I'm like, I guess it's
[01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:34.590]  like going and taking an, a leave, you know, instead of taking a leave or Tylenol or Prickle,
[01:46:34.590 --> 01:46:38.830]  whatever's I'm just taking a few dabs and keeping the pain away all the time. For sure. And it kind
[01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:44.750]  of, the dabs make my head. Uh, I talk about, I prefer Indica flowers and sativa dabs. Dabs make
[01:46:44.750 --> 01:46:49.950]  my head go really fast. I take the alpha brain, take two dabs and drink a little bit of caffeine
[01:46:49.950 --> 01:46:53.950]  and bro, I can work for 12 hours straight without a break. No shit. Let's just go.
[01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:58.190]  Picking at your skin. I don't know what that was. That was weird. Cause you started saying I can
[01:46:58.190 --> 01:47:01.550]  work for like 12 hours state and then they started picking at your skin. I said, Jeff,
[01:47:02.190 --> 01:47:07.390]  what else are you doing in them dabs? So I ate a donut earlier and apparently part of the frosting
[01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:11.790]  was stuck to my arm hair. And when I pulled on it, it really hurt. Oh my God. You're such a
[01:47:11.790 --> 01:47:16.430]  wuss. Well, you pull on your arm hair, bro. Pull some of that shit out. Okay. It's not a thing.
[01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:23.630]  You're cooler than me. I'm just so high. I couldn't feel my arm. I had a donut frosting
[01:47:23.630 --> 01:47:29.870]  dingleberry in my arm hair. I like, I like that. I like donut frosting, dingleberry in my arm hair.
[01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:34.510]  I know. Just, I just like the donut frosting dingleberry. I like that. I don't know why.
[01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:39.070]  I hope that you consider that for the name of this episode.
[01:47:42.030 --> 01:47:47.230]  Nobody will listen if we do that. I warned him. I warned them immediately when they were coming on,
[01:47:47.230 --> 01:47:52.270]  if they're still with us. Yeah. You guys are soldiers. Not soldier on what else we got?
[01:47:53.070 --> 01:47:58.910]  All right. So Holy crap. Uh, guys don't smoke as much as Clint did, but smoke as much as I did.
[01:47:58.910 --> 01:48:01.950]  And that's, that's funny because that's a good example. I've probably consumed,
[01:48:02.590 --> 01:48:07.390]  since Clint's been here, five dabs, I'm going to guess four or five dabs at least since Clint's
[01:48:07.390 --> 01:48:12.350]  been here for two puffs off of that bowl. And of course I've been smoking throughout the day,
[01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:16.510]  you know, it's seven o'clock almost. So I've probably had 12 dabs by now today.
[01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:21.470]  Oh, and I smoked nothing all day today. And Clint is ruined. I'm not going to let Clint
[01:48:21.470 --> 01:48:27.470]  drive for at least another hour. Oh, for sure. And, uh, I could pass any sobriety test that you
[01:48:27.470 --> 01:48:31.870]  needed me to right now. Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm not even being a smart ass. I am going to burp,
[01:48:32.670 --> 01:48:37.070]  but I really could pass almost any sobriety test you offered me at this point. Yeah. Yeah. It's
[01:48:37.070 --> 01:48:41.550]  all about your body chemistry, uh, where you're used to being, where you're trying to be, how long
[01:48:41.550 --> 01:48:45.790]  your dreadlocks are, how long your dreadlocks are. That's funny, dude. Cause I've seen some people
[01:48:45.790 --> 01:48:48.830]  with dreads trying to be cool and they can't keep up at all. They think that because they got the
[01:48:48.830 --> 01:48:51.950]  dreads, they're going to be able to party with me. I'm like, yeah, take a half gram dab. Let's
[01:48:51.950 --> 01:48:55.950]  see who you are. You got to carry them to the couch. Yeah. All right. Somebody asked me,
[01:48:57.470 --> 01:49:00.190]  drag them by the dreads, right to the couch, drag them out in the front yard.
[01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:05.950]  Somebody also sent me a message about trim machines. They said, how do you feel about
[01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:10.270]  trim machines? Uh, honestly, you're going to think I'm a prick, but fuck a trim machine,
[01:49:10.270 --> 01:49:14.990]  a trim machine ruins your trim. Uh, it chops up the, it makes a mess of your buds. Uh,
[01:49:15.710 --> 01:49:22.030]  high grade top shelf cannabis is hand trimmed. Uh, trim machines don't have fingers or eyes.
[01:49:22.030 --> 01:49:27.470]  They don't care. They don't put in love. Uh, they mingle the buds. I think if you've got a nice
[01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:31.470]  bud and you run it through a trim machine, it's not going to take off all the leaf in one spot.
[01:49:31.470 --> 01:49:34.830]  And it will take off some of the bud in some spot. And this is from experience. I've helped
[01:49:34.830 --> 01:49:40.430]  other people use trim machines. We use the spin pro I've seen the, uh, the grim or the trim Reaper.
[01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:45.710]  I've seen the tsunami thing. I don't like the way any of them work. Also, what it does is it
[01:49:45.710 --> 01:49:51.790]  turns your trim into a mulch. It chops it up into this really funky mulch. And then it almost
[01:49:51.790 --> 01:49:58.990]  creates too many cuts so that the moisture seeps out of the leave the leaves or the trim in a weird
[01:49:58.990 --> 01:50:03.470]  way. And it doesn't, it'll, it'll mold up. There's almost no way to prevent that shit from turning
[01:50:04.270 --> 01:50:10.990]  So I like to hand trim that way. You can separate the big leaves from the good trim and you can know
[01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:16.430]  what you're making hash with. And nobody's going to trim it like a person like, uh, at the
[01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:21.790]  dispensaries, they've got a whole crew of trimmers that hand trim everything. And they don't go as
[01:50:21.790 --> 01:50:25.870]  quickly as a trimmer, but I think it's well worth it. You can see the difference. Uh, it's a whole
[01:50:25.870 --> 01:50:30.990]  bunch of like 22 to 28 year old people. They just want to trim all day. They're eager to get into
[01:50:30.990 --> 01:50:34.910]  the cannabis business and they just want to trim. So they just kick ass all day in hopes of getting
[01:50:34.910 --> 01:50:40.030]  promoted to a blood tender or a grower. And that's who does the trimming. Uh, I'd rather have those
[01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:44.510]  six or eight people sitting around trimming all day, every day than to trim machines running.
[01:50:44.510 --> 01:50:50.350]  Honestly. Yeah. So, uh, fucking auto trimmer, fucking trim machine, trim it by hand. Yeah.
[01:50:50.350 --> 01:50:55.070]  Use some scissors. Use your eyes. I don't want to get on frame. I got fucking carpal tunnel,
[01:50:55.070 --> 01:50:59.470]  dude. I've got carpal tunnel. I got thumb calluses. I got four finger calluses.
[01:50:59.470 --> 01:51:05.630]  Uh, I got wrist sores just from trimming. Just from my X-Box. Probably just from my X-Box.
[01:51:05.630 --> 01:51:09.070]  Probably trimmed a hundred pounds of weed. I don't know more than a hundred pounds of weed in my life.
[01:51:09.070 --> 01:51:13.630]  I'm pretty sure I've trimmed more than a hundred pounds by myself. Um, also there was a second half
[01:51:13.630 --> 01:51:17.950]  to that question that somebody emailed to me. Uh, the second half of that question is kind of lengthy
[01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:21.390]  and I'm going to have to do some research and give you a more thought out answer for that.
[01:51:21.390 --> 01:51:26.110]  I did not prepare enough time for that answer. It's a really good question and I will get back
[01:51:26.110 --> 01:51:29.630]  to you. I'm not blowing it off. That's just, I want to be accurate and a little more in depth
[01:51:29.630 --> 01:51:35.390]  for you because that is a hell of a good question. Uh, let's see. Hey, you know, it'd be fun. What's
[01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:42.350]  up? Hey, if you, uh, if you put out the call or like if maybe somebody, uh, like that listens
[01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:46.430]  as a friend that has like a really great weed story from like the seventies, do you know what
[01:51:46.430 --> 01:51:52.030]  I mean? Like, like one of those, like we had to get away from the cops kind of things like, and,
[01:51:52.030 --> 01:51:56.830]  and how, how, how great it is now. So you want me to get some Chong's on kind of, all right,
[01:51:56.830 --> 01:52:01.150]  that'd be fun. I don't know. I know a guy, uh, I'm actually his medical marijuana provider
[01:52:01.150 --> 01:52:04.670]  and he's an old cat and he loves to tell me stories, bro. And you know what? I had him on
[01:52:04.670 --> 01:52:09.230]  the podcast one time on seven, one nine, the blocks. And I remember that when we put on the
[01:52:09.230 --> 01:52:12.990]  headphones on him and put the microphone in front of him, something lit up inside of him.
[01:52:12.990 --> 01:52:18.190]  And his voice turned into like this and he got all spectacular and charismatic. And at the end
[01:52:18.190 --> 01:52:21.230]  of the show, I was like, dude, have you done this before? And he goes, I did college radio, man.
[01:52:21.230 --> 01:52:27.230]  And there's nothing fucking like it, bro. I was like, yeah, he was, this is college radio. Isn't
[01:52:27.230 --> 01:52:30.670]  it? It kind of is. Yeah. It's it's our, it's a digital college radio. And it was weird. And
[01:52:30.670 --> 01:52:34.750]  then we got our like cult little followers and shit. And we'll listen and I, and I'm sure that's
[01:52:34.750 --> 01:52:40.750]  not for me, but I mean, that's I'm here. So suck it. Uh, every guest, even though you're a dick,
[01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:46.430]  every guest that comes on brings their own audience. Like you'll, you'll retweet my tweet
[01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:50.270]  that you're on here. And then when I tweet that, Hey, talk, Clint was on the show. I don't know,
[01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:54.990]  maybe one of your three Twitter followers. Yeah. I don't go, um, you know, but maybe if you have
[01:52:54.990 --> 01:52:59.310]  10, maybe two of them will check out the show and one of them will probably like it. So we'll get
[01:52:59.310 --> 01:53:04.350]  another listener and then we can bring Sam talent on and then, uh, and both cross paths. Cause I
[01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:08.110]  really want everybody to hear Sam talent. He's really funny. Yeah. We'll get him on the show.
[01:53:08.110 --> 01:53:11.230]  Invite him, dude. He'll be on the show. We'll tell him to come down pretty early, record 30
[01:53:11.230 --> 01:53:14.910]  minutes and we'll put it out as one of those Thursday episodes. That's cool, man. Uh, thank
[01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:17.950]  you guys for listening, dude. I want to thank you guys all. We're just talking about our fans and
[01:53:17.950 --> 01:53:21.230]  our little cult following. And it really inspired me to say thank you because I haven't said that
[01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:25.310]  enough lately. I've been caught up in putting out a show and keeping the guest entertained and
[01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:29.310]  keeping the flow happening to our heaven. Uh, sincerely said, Holy shit. Thank you guys. We
[01:53:29.310 --> 01:53:35.310]  get so many downloads, so many listens, uh, the website traffic. I had to pay for more bandwidth
[01:53:35.310 --> 01:53:40.110]  on my website because you guys were killing it. Downloading episodes, the traffic on the website
[01:53:40.110 --> 01:53:45.550]  is exploding. Uh, it's going nuts. We had to fix the file type that I upload so that it's more
[01:53:45.550 --> 01:53:50.430]  available for stitcher, uh, because people were downloading it so much that it was slowing down
[01:53:50.430 --> 01:53:54.830]  the stitcher application on their phone. So I changed the file, the type, the type of file
[01:53:54.830 --> 01:53:58.430]  that I upload. It's a little smaller. It doesn't sound as good, but nobody's probably going to
[01:53:58.430 --> 01:54:02.750]  notice. It's just a voice podcast. It's not like we're putting out freaking dance music or anything.
[01:54:02.750 --> 01:54:07.950]  So, but yeah, people are listening and I really, really appreciate it. If you've told a friend,
[01:54:07.950 --> 01:54:13.710]  like we really appreciate that too. Yeah. You know, I told Drew and Dustin about this because
[01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:18.910]  I was like, no, this, I was really funny on this thing. I thought I was really funny back. Like,
[01:54:19.470 --> 01:54:24.510]  geez, I've been on this thing like eight times. We're fucking, this is my favorite.
[01:54:26.430 --> 01:54:31.470]  Nice. The one that you crashed the fucking intro to. No, no, no. This, this just doing this podcast
[01:54:31.470 --> 01:54:35.710]  is fun. This is great, man. You look comfortable. You finally got your head bobbing. Yeah. You're
[01:54:35.710 --> 01:54:40.990]  loving it now. I feel good, man. No, I just, uh, it is nice, but it's nice to tell one friend and
[01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:45.470]  then they tell one friend and then they tell one friends. That's all I'm asking is tell your friend
[01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:52.430]  about a Sam talent. Tell your friends about a girl from your heart. Yeah. Sam talent's coming down to
[01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:57.310]  do the podcast. It's going to be awesome. I got to get people out to that show, man. It's so
[01:54:57.310 --> 01:55:01.790]  fucking, it's so ridiculous. Life is on the line. If you guys don't go to the show, his life is
[01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:07.230]  going to fall apart. I'm just kidding. Not really. It'll just suck. All right. So, uh, let's see,
[01:55:07.230 --> 01:55:10.510]  do I have any more notes that I want to talk about on today's episode? I think we can almost,
[01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:14.350]  uh, if you want to fucking ramble on about something for a couple of minutes, man, what's
[01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:19.310]  your, uh, how long, how long have we done now? We've gone 33 minutes, but I imagine that one to
[01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:23.630]  three minutes will be taken out. So we got about 30 minutes of usable material. Jesus. There was a,
[01:55:23.630 --> 01:55:28.430]  there was a depressing part in there too. I hope that does not make the podcast. Jesus. I'll make
[01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:32.190]  you look dignified before this comes out. That'd be really funny. If like, just during that part,
[01:55:32.190 --> 01:55:37.070]  you go, Clint wants you to come out to your, to the, to the show. And like, you just edit that in
[01:55:39.150 --> 01:55:43.150]  just a bunch of mumbles. And then yeah, please come to the show. Please come to Clint's show.
[01:55:43.150 --> 01:55:47.310]  I will apologize for this air conditioner. That's making a whole bunch of damn noise over my
[01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:50.110]  shoulder. I'm going to try to take that out of the recording, but I can hear it just going
[01:55:51.230 --> 01:55:55.630]  in my head and it's driving the producer in me. Absolutely bonkers. That's fucking rad,
[01:55:55.630 --> 01:55:59.950]  dude. That's good. I'm glad you got such a talent for this. Well, thank you, friend. Thanks for it,
[01:55:59.950 --> 01:56:05.150]  dude. Yeah, I've been doing, this is my 78th episode on this show. And then I did about 50
[01:56:05.150 --> 01:56:10.110]  on another show. So I've had a little bit of practice and I think I finally got it figured
[01:56:10.110 --> 01:56:13.790]  out. That's cool, man. It took a minute, but thanks for noticing the, the improvements that
[01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:17.630]  I've done. A lot of people have actually said that they've gone back and listened from episode
[01:56:17.630 --> 01:56:22.430]  number one up to whatever the current episode is. Yeah. And part of me makes my, hang my,
[01:56:22.430 --> 01:56:27.150]  makes me hang my head in shame. Like, oh, you heard episodes one through five where I was like,
[01:56:27.150 --> 01:56:33.070]  not sure what I was doing at all. And then, but then I'm like, oh, but that means you also heard
[01:56:33.070 --> 01:56:38.030]  75 where I knew everything that I was doing by now. Like, I don't know everything about a podcast,
[01:56:38.030 --> 01:56:41.470]  but I feel like I can come on here and do a show now. I don't know, before it would take me three
[01:56:41.470 --> 01:56:45.470]  hours worth of getting stuff together and being nervous and three different takes of putting a
[01:56:45.470 --> 01:56:49.150]  show together. And now I'm just like, what up podcast time? Let's kill it. See, that's fucking
[01:56:49.150 --> 01:56:53.150]  cool, man. That's neat. Then, and I'll bet those people that have listened to all of them, like,
[01:56:53.150 --> 01:56:56.830]  feel like they know you pretty well. And it's fun meeting those people because some people
[01:56:56.830 --> 01:56:59.470]  come out of nowhere and they're like, dude, you're Ross. They'll hear my voice at the
[01:56:59.470 --> 01:57:02.990]  grocery store. Somebody was like, you're that guy on the podcast. And I was like, yeah, man,
[01:57:02.990 --> 01:57:05.950]  how'd you know? And they're like, I can recognize your voice. And I was like, that's fucking
[01:57:05.950 --> 01:57:08.590]  awesome. Good to meet you. And now I hang out with those guys. I go to their house and take
[01:57:08.590 --> 01:57:13.150]  dabs and shit. Yeah. No, but that's kind of what I'm saying is if you, if you listen,
[01:57:13.150 --> 01:57:18.590]  if I can let us know, dude, we're just human. Yeah. I mean, it's fun. I'm all over Colorado,
[01:57:18.590 --> 01:57:22.510]  dude. I travel all over Colorado and I'll hang out and take dabs with you. I'm not afraid. I'm
[01:57:22.510 --> 01:57:26.030]  not worried if you're listening to the show, you're good people. I am. I am not taking dabs
[01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:30.030]  with anybody. Come on, Clint. You're all heathens. We'll come with me and he'll not take
[01:57:30.030 --> 01:57:34.750]  dabs and he'll sit there and stare at you. Judgmentally. That's right. I will. I'll be
[01:57:34.750 --> 01:57:40.430]  like your dad. You'd be looking at me like, God damn it. I wish that we hadn't brought Jeff's dad
[01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:44.910]  in some dark glasses, bro. And you can just be my security guard. That's security. I just need
[01:57:44.910 --> 01:57:50.910]  a mustache. Just a mustache. Just a mustache. I got the hair for the seventies. I think I could
[01:57:50.910 --> 01:57:54.510]  plan that. I wasn't going to mention your feathered seventies hair. What's with that?
[01:57:54.510 --> 01:57:59.150]  Are you filming porn when you leave here? Yeah. I got a couple of things going. Um,
[01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:02.830]  since we're way, way off topic, that was fun. What would be your porn name anyway?
[01:58:04.830 --> 01:58:10.670]  Peter Frampton. I don't think that's available. I think this screen name is not available.
[01:58:10.670 --> 01:58:12.910]  That'd be fucking fun though. Peter Frampton underscore.
[01:58:18.590 --> 01:58:23.470]  I like that. Yeah. It's spelled the word underscore. Nah, I was thinking about it.
[01:58:23.470 --> 01:58:27.230]  I was like, no, cause then that's a pain in the ass. And then you can't get the Twitter handle
[01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:34.910]  cause it's too long. Peter Frampton underscore. Do you feel like I do? All right. I do what I can.
[01:58:34.910 --> 01:58:38.990]  I like fucking Peter Frampton though. That would be great. I bet it's so some porn still
[01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:44.590]  maybe. And then the next one I'm Bret Michaels. Frampton comes alive. Oh God. Yeah. See,
[01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:48.990]  see, you got it. We got it. All right. We're winning. We're going to wrap up this show here
[01:58:48.990 --> 01:58:53.790]  really soon. It's almost seven 10 in Colorado. Oh shit. Yeah. Big shout out to the wild cousins.
[01:58:53.790 --> 01:58:57.230]  Big shout out to Clint for coming on the show and getting way too high. I appreciate that.
[01:58:57.230 --> 01:59:01.790]  Yeah. So that was the answer to your question is just don't get too high and do a podcast.
[01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:05.790]  Yeah. Don't be recorded while you're super high because you may say some shit that you regret.
[01:59:05.790 --> 01:59:08.990]  I'm not going to regret any of that. Hopefully your friend is the producer and he'll take all
[01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:12.990]  of it out for you. I don't think I'm going to regret anything. All right. I didn't say anything
[01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:17.550]  stupid. You're good. Hey, I've been doing this thing called Periscope. Periscope is an app that
[01:59:17.550 --> 01:59:22.590]  you can get on your phone, either your iPhone or your Android device. Just go download Periscope.
[01:59:22.590 --> 01:59:29.470]  And then what you could do is follow me. I'm at Rasta Jeff 420 on Periscope. Occasionally,
[01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:33.870]  more than occasionally, at least once, maybe twice a day, I jump on Periscope and I will
[01:59:33.870 --> 01:59:40.510]  do a live video where I sit here in the recording area. And he does drugs. I do drugs. I take big
[01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:45.870]  fat dabs. Sometimes I take my morning dabs or my afternoon dabs, whatever the first puff session of
[01:59:45.870 --> 01:59:51.310]  the day is. I'll get on Periscope, take a few dabs with you guys, talk a little bit of wisdom,
[01:59:51.310 --> 01:59:55.550]  drop some knowledge on you guys. I'll answer a few questions if you type it in the question box.
[01:59:55.550 --> 02:00:00.590]  And once I get good at recording the show, setting the phone here in front of the computer,
[02:00:00.590 --> 02:00:06.990]  getting on Periscope and forgetting that Periscope is going and still paying attention to the chat
[02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:14.830]  and Periscope, I will start doing a live show on Periscope as I record. So you guys are on
[02:00:14.830 --> 02:00:18.110]  Periscope with me. We'll be able to ask me questions live and I'll be able to read them
[02:00:18.110 --> 02:00:22.990]  on the screen. I will read the question aloud into the microphone and I'd be like, so tall.
[02:00:22.990 --> 02:00:26.190]  Clint says, how come you don't ever brush your hair? And then I'll answer the question.
[02:00:26.910 --> 02:00:31.390]  Did I hear that so much on Periscope? It's really, there's a lot of trolls. Oh, I'm troll proof, dude.
[02:00:31.390 --> 02:00:34.350]  Well, I should have not just said that on the podcast because now they want to challenge my
[02:00:34.350 --> 02:00:41.230]  troll game. I am troll proof on Periscope. It's my page. I know I'm dirty. Yeah. I know I got
[02:00:41.230 --> 02:00:46.030]  dreadlocks, whatever. You're not going to fucking make me cry. Well, that's the thing is nobody's
[02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:50.430]  ever said anything original anymore. That's the truth. I mean, that's, that's, I'm always like,
[02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:55.550]  Oh, I heard that. Yeah. That's, that's tough about comedy too. Cause there's a lot of jokes
[02:00:55.550 --> 02:01:00.910]  that have been done. That's why, you know, we're just trying to do new stuff. That's all it is.
[02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:06.030]  But troll proof is fucking awesome. Troll proof that I should make a screen name or something
[02:01:06.030 --> 02:01:09.630]  that's troll proof. Cause I feel like I'm troll proof. I'm a grown ass man. I'm sure that's taken
[02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:17.470]  I'm quite secure with myself. Do troll proof on Periscope right now. Just type it in as the thing
[02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:21.550]  and then have everybody just say mean things that you, that'd be a lot of fun. Not on the show
[02:01:21.550 --> 02:01:27.710]  though. Yeah. We'll do that right after look for us. This is stupid. Yeah. Make sure you guys check
[02:01:27.710 --> 02:01:30.590]  me out on Periscope once in a while though, because I come on late at night, early in the
[02:01:30.590 --> 02:01:35.390]  morning, random times, just take fat dabs. I'm on a really weird schedule being employed and
[02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:40.670]  self-employed and being a producer of a show. My hours are really random. I go to bed around
[02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:44.430]  four in the morning and get up around like somewhere between nine and 10, sometimes 11.
[02:01:44.430 --> 02:01:48.670]  If I'm lucky, the sun comes up and I just start getting up and doing shit, man. It's the way it's
[02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:52.510]  got to be done. Yeah. You got to hustle quite often. I'm up by nine o'clock cause some of the
[02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:56.430]  grill lights come on at nine shit. Sometimes I got to be at the spot by eight. I got to get a
[02:01:56.430 --> 02:02:02.510]  fucking job, man. Jesus. Yeah. This shit sucks. Yeah. Clint had a great comedy set. One day Clint
[02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:07.630]  got, uh, he got relieved of his position as it at his spot of employment. And then we drove up
[02:02:07.630 --> 02:02:13.470]  and watched him do comedy. And that comedy set was quite awkward. Yeah, for sure. I felt like I was
[02:02:13.470 --> 02:02:16.990]  the wife that was about to get beat because you were the husband that lost his job. I was pretty
[02:02:16.990 --> 02:02:20.190]  mad that day. I could tell, but we're doing everything we could to put you in a better head.
[02:02:20.190 --> 02:02:24.670]  Now you guys did good. You look like you're in a much better space than like 40 minutes ago.
[02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:30.430]  Yeah, no, we're just, uh, no, everybody's all in this all together, man. Everything's happening
[02:02:30.430 --> 02:02:34.350]  for a reason. That's what I believe. That's the damn truth. You guys. All right, we're going to
[02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:38.990]  wrap up this show. We've been rambling for 40 minutes. We warned you immediately. I warned you
[02:02:38.990 --> 02:02:46.590]  immediately. He didn't warn me as the problem. He got the warning at the same time. Jeff got the
[02:02:46.590 --> 02:02:50.830]  front of this one because you guys had the opportunity to not listen to this. And I'm
[02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:55.230]  going to edit some of this out. So he's going to have to listen to this again, twice, twice,
[02:02:55.230 --> 02:02:58.670]  because I'll listen to it as I edit it. And then when it's complete, I'll give it one full,
[02:02:58.670 --> 02:03:02.910]  complete listen through just to make sure it's, yeah, it doesn't sound shitty. Yeah. Or I didn't
[02:03:02.910 --> 02:03:06.830]  do any hard peas or anything like that. I don't even fix the hard peas and S's. I think the
[02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:11.070]  software does most of that for me. Really? That's pretty cool. I bought good shit. No, no. I'm just
[02:03:11.070 --> 02:03:14.670]  saying that's cool that you're getting help. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I got this piece over
[02:03:14.670 --> 02:03:17.950]  here. I got this piece over here. I got my daughter calling me. So you want me to turn
[02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:22.030]  down your mic? Yeah, cool. Here you go. All right, guys. Oh, wait, was it him? No. Yeah. Cool. I'm
[02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:26.750]  going to wrap up the show. Clint's got to step away for a second. Perfect timing. Um, I got to
[02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:31.950]  find the paper. All right. Uh, you guys know the show's over. Go to iTunes. Uh, search for the
[02:03:31.950 --> 02:03:34.910]  Grow From Your Heart podcast. Find the review section. Give me a five-star rating. After that,
[02:03:34.910 --> 02:03:38.510]  type in a comment. Let me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comment on a future
[02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:42.190]  episode. Uh, you can leave a comment on Stitcher if you'd like, but it's really hard to find the
[02:03:42.190 --> 02:03:48.670]  comments. I will go and look, but Stitcher is really weird. So, um, find me on all the social
[02:03:48.670 --> 02:03:53.310]  media sites, please. I'm on Facebook. It's at Grow From Your Heart podcast. I'm on Twitter. It's,
[02:03:53.390 --> 02:03:59.870]  uh, at GFYH podcast, or it's just at GFYH. No, it's at GFYH podcast. I'm sorry. Uh, follow
[02:03:59.870 --> 02:04:04.910]  Irie Genetics on Instagram. Don't forget the show's available on iTunes, Stitcher, and every
[02:04:04.910 --> 02:04:10.190]  single episode is archived on iriegeneticscolorado.com. Clint has jumped back on the microphone. Is
[02:04:10.190 --> 02:04:13.390]  everything cool, brother? Yeah, everything's great. It's just when your daughter calls you,
[02:04:13.390 --> 02:04:17.150]  you answer. I totally understand. I've got one myself. I've been bragging about her birthday on
[02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:21.150]  the past couple episodes, and if she called right now, we would talk to her. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's
[02:04:21.150 --> 02:04:25.230]  what, that's, that's the thing. I got a nine year old. Yeah. That's what dads do, bro. That's what
[02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:29.070]  we're supposed to do. Answer when the girl calls. Yeah. I appreciate all your fans and everything,
[02:04:29.070 --> 02:04:33.230]  but that's the one thing that's going to stop. Oh, for sure. Yeah. Not many things that we
[02:04:33.230 --> 02:04:37.550]  stopped recording for, but the, the daughters. Yeah. Yeah. Aren't that great? We're actually
[02:04:37.550 --> 02:04:44.990]  good people too. He's a fucking dirty hippie. I'm a foul mouthed sailor of a like person.
[02:04:44.990 --> 02:04:49.470]  I don't know. What was the analogy I was going for there? A comedian. Oh, that guy's a dick.
[02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:56.670]  But the little ones first, bro. Cause that's, yeah. We need to make this. Can you edit out all
[02:04:56.670 --> 02:05:03.470]  the fucks? Fuck no. Back in the day I did what was called the, the dollar fuck jar and the money got
[02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:07.630]  donated to somebody. Actually the money is sitting somewhere and that dude has not contacted me. So
[02:05:07.630 --> 02:05:12.350]  he doesn't listen to the show anymore. So my fault. But speaking of money, there's a donation
[02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:16.750]  button on the podcast page. If you go to the website, it's I read genetics, colorado.com.
[02:05:16.750 --> 02:05:19.710]  Click on the growth from your heart podcast tab. It's top right. There's a donation button,
[02:05:19.790 --> 02:05:23.630]  little PayPal logo that goes directly to my PayPal account. Guys, I'm not begging you. I'm just
[02:05:23.630 --> 02:05:28.910]  letting you know it's there. The podcast is always going to be free. This comes to you from me as a
[02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:34.190]  gift. Cause I love you. I love cannabis. I want you to grow better cannabis. I want to break the
[02:05:34.190 --> 02:05:40.270]  stigma and fears associated with cannabis. I want to help out the plant. I want to free the plant.
[02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:44.670]  So this is all free, but if you do feel like making a contribution, I would love it. I'd give
[02:05:44.670 --> 02:05:49.470]  you a shout out on the show. I'd say, thank you. Uh, just go to the website, click on the PayPal
[02:05:49.470 --> 02:05:53.550]  thing, throw in however much you feel like you'd like to. I'm not begging, but it's there. Uh,
[02:05:53.550 --> 02:05:58.670]  like I said, run all the social media sites. Um, Clint, thanks for coming, dude. That was fun,
[02:05:58.670 --> 02:06:02.510]  dude. It was a lot of fun. I'll bet your fans fucking hate me now. Oh no, they're only going
[02:06:02.510 --> 02:06:07.950]  to get like 30 minutes of your ear bashing. So it'll be okay. That was brutal. Yes. Thanks for
[02:06:07.950 --> 02:06:11.710]  tolerating Clint. I promise you won't be on the next episode. We won't have him back for a few
[02:06:11.710 --> 02:06:16.670]  episodes. We should get Spence here pretty soon. I'm trying to get a few other new people on the
[02:06:16.670 --> 02:06:21.390]  show. I've got a lot of news lined up for the next episode. There's already stuff in the works. I'm
[02:06:21.390 --> 02:06:28.830]  trying to get shirts made by episode 100. There's a lot of stuff going on. Yeah. All right. So a
[02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:32.510]  shout out to my ninja Spence until next time. Thanks again for listening. Take a fat dab.
[02:06:32.510 --> 02:06:33.550]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[02:06:42.270 --> 02:06:47.630]  My brain just to see if any little piece of art remains. It's hard to change. I'm getting used to
[02:06:47.630 --> 02:06:52.830]  routine these days of all the same wearing like my blue jeans. I got a few schemes, but I ain't
[02:06:52.830 --> 02:06:58.110]  made a bridge. Sometimes my mood swings. Sometimes I hate the bitch. Too many lost dreams. None of my
[02:06:58.110 --> 02:07:03.790]  plans met 26 and I don't feel like a man yet. I can't sweat it all the time because it makes me
[02:07:03.790 --> 02:07:08.990]  see sometimes I hate to think it's just another page of ink. Still scared to fly in my bird's
[02:07:09.070 --> 02:07:14.110]  nest. Never dared to try. But the sky is where you heard best. I deserve less. I never thought
[02:07:14.110 --> 02:07:19.550]  I'd say it, but too many people in my life have paid it off and waited for a handout to come to
[02:07:19.550 --> 02:07:24.510]  me. Thought I had my plans now mapped out comfortably getting older. Now that isn't who I
[02:07:24.510 --> 02:07:29.310]  want to be looking in the mirror. I'm unaware of what's in front of me. I got a ton to see and I
[02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:34.430]  ain't getting younger. Deciding not to jump was my biggest blunder. I sit and wonder about what
[02:07:34.430 --> 02:07:39.310]  could have been and instead of jealous hate these days I say good for him. Fuck this shit you right.
[02:07:39.310 --> 02:07:43.870]  Cause all of that stuff is worthless. If your shit ain't tight then tell me what's the purpose?
[02:07:43.870 --> 02:07:48.830]  Me and him. He's one in a hundred verses. Now if y'all are underground we're working above the surface.
[02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:54.430]  Fuck this shit you right. Cause all of that stuff is worthless. And if your shit ain't tight then tell me what's the purpose?
[02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:59.310]  Me and Taz. He's one in a hundred verses. If y'all are underground we're working above the surface.
[02:08:00.110 --> 02:08:05.230]  Everything I see keeps changing. Afraid of the day life sweeps me away with it.
[02:08:05.230 --> 02:08:10.430]  My old friends seem like strangers. I'm cold and alone but I think I'm okay with it.
[02:08:10.430 --> 02:08:16.910]  My mind says no don't give in on a solo mission to be oh so different. I make mistakes but I don't
[02:08:16.910 --> 02:08:21.790]  go fix it. Bounce from place to place like I'm pogo sticking. Started when I was a little kid.
[02:08:21.790 --> 02:08:27.790]  I don't know when it'll stop. Maybe never. Cause change is forever ever. I'm just a fan. So it makes me
[02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:33.390]  better. Executing my plans until my plate sees cheddar. Not a mainstream rapper just an AC setter.
[02:08:33.390 --> 02:08:39.230]  That's a crazy cracker with amazing effort. And though I know it'd be nice to be filthy rich.
[02:08:39.230 --> 02:08:44.350]  And have 26 kids with a milky chick. I really think I'd rather stick with this music shit.
[02:08:44.350 --> 02:08:49.790]  Even if it's underground unreleased exclusive shit. This music's got me feeling like a million bucks.
[02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:55.230]  And having children right now would have me feeling stuck. 4am bills out to rent downtown.
[02:08:55.230 --> 02:09:03.230]  By 7 I'm still out to get clout. Film spouts and spill out correct sounds. Like a beat makers with build ups to let down.
[02:09:03.230 --> 02:09:08.190]  And even though I know I speak intelligent I still think that shit is my weakest element.
[02:09:08.190 --> 02:09:13.550]  Almost as known as that graffiti felling kid and every MC knows that my beats are hella sick.
[02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:18.990]  I get fucked wild often. I can shoot gum while I'm walking. Shoot guns while coughing.
[02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:24.190]  Mom I know you're worrying but don't know I'm barging your garden to burge me of po-po.
[02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:30.830]  I don't like police or this malevolent machine. Foolish icy beast I'll hit that bullseye blindfolded.
[02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:36.030]  Quite focused on the rise like yeast to feast. It's my mode I'm devoted to being loaded.
[02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:42.670]  Or at least noticed. Noted this whole scene's bogus. Every track I collab my 16's dopest.
[02:09:42.670 --> 02:09:47.310]  Even my weakest piece of shit is so sick. I should go and name this song I'm on my own.
[02:09:47.310 --> 02:09:51.230]  Did kid me on my phone if you want your poems ghost written.
[02:09:51.230 --> 02:09:55.070]  Standard fees apply can't read or write. Raps try these for size.
[02:10:36.070 --> 02:10:39.910]  Jeff thanks again for joining me. As always I want to send that huge thank you shout out to
[02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:43.830]  the Mystic Roots band. They let me use their song on the show. It's really cool. Then big thanks to
[02:10:43.830 --> 02:10:49.030]  Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew. I hope you guys are having a great evening. Sorry I got
[02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:51.990]  to clear my throat. I'm right at the start of the show. I'm already getting a frog in my throat.
[02:10:52.630 --> 02:10:56.550]  Dude sitting across the table from me you guys will have no you'll be so surprised. Guess who's
[02:10:56.550 --> 02:11:01.270]  here? Jesse's back. Say what's up bro. Hey what's up everyone. You have no idea how hard it is to
[02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:05.430]  get this guy on a podcast you guys. You have no idea what it takes to pull Jesse away from his
[02:11:05.430 --> 02:11:09.270]  life to come be on the show for an hour and get him high out of his mind and then send him home
[02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:14.150]  hungry as shit. All right dude thanks for coming bro really I appreciate it. Oh no problem. Jesse
[02:11:14.150 --> 02:11:19.750]  is a busy man. He's a ganja farmer. He's uh running some shit over at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:26.310]  What else you got going on bro? Uh mechanic shop. Mechanic shop. Hot rod shop. This guy does a
[02:11:26.310 --> 02:11:32.470]  little bit of everything. You need to learn how to do uh are you an electrician? Um yeah okay no.
[02:11:33.270 --> 02:11:36.870]  If you ask somebody if they're an electrician and they go well kind of you know they are not
[02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:41.910]  an electrician. Yeah it doesn't need to be legal is the big question there. So that means no.
[02:11:43.670 --> 02:11:48.230]  So this is something that Jesse is good at. He is the man at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:11:48.230 --> 02:11:51.910]  Uh this podcast is brought to you by my great friends at Hydro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[02:12:53.110 --> 02:12:57.670]  So Jesse is here you guys. We don't have to do a whole bunch of technical formal introductions.
[02:12:57.670 --> 02:13:03.190]  Let's get right down to it. We all wanted Jesse to come on the show and do another grow lesson
[02:13:03.190 --> 02:13:10.390]  for us because it's outdoor season. We know that growing outdoor is almost free. Some people asked
[02:13:10.390 --> 02:13:16.470]  me kind of about doing a budget episode like if they don't have a lot of money. So I figured we'll
[02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:21.430]  work on getting the basics of an outdoor grow going and then maybe if we have some extra time
[02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:25.670]  we will talk about maybe how to do a budget grow so that way people don't have to break the bank to
[02:13:25.670 --> 02:13:29.990]  build their grow and grow a whole bunch of ganja. Oh yeah. You can totally do that. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:33.910]  We have some ideas. Jesse and I have been at this for a minute. I bet we could build a hoop house
[02:13:33.910 --> 02:13:39.270]  together in probably two hours. Oh easily. Yeah. Yeah. Jesse's got the tools and I'll keep the
[02:13:39.270 --> 02:13:47.190]  dab nail hot. All right. So a lot of what we're going to talk about may be kind of regional to
[02:13:47.190 --> 02:13:52.950]  Colorado. You may have to adjust a lot of what we say for your area. If you're in California you
[02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:56.870]  may be a little bit earlier than us. If you're on the east coast it's going to be a whole different
[02:13:56.870 --> 02:14:01.190]  story. Yeah. Whole different. Yeah. I don't even know how to teach you to grow in the south or in the east
[02:14:01.190 --> 02:14:06.870]  where you've got a lot more humidity. The scheduling is a lot more wonky. The weather comes. Midwest is
[02:14:07.430 --> 02:14:13.110]  pretty similar to us. Just a lot easier for them. So all right. So we'll get it. We'll get most of
[02:14:13.110 --> 02:14:17.430]  this stuff based on Colorado grows but we'll try to get it to where everybody can work with this.
[02:14:18.070 --> 02:14:23.430]  So I guess the first question we should start with is where. Where should we start growing?
[02:14:23.430 --> 02:14:29.350]  Where should we look at growing our outdoor crop? Where would be our ideal space? You want a
[02:14:29.350 --> 02:14:39.510]  south facing or good southern view for the sun. Starting this one off all stoned.
[02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:44.950]  It'll come out of you eventually and I can edit some stuff. For sure. No need for that.
[02:14:46.230 --> 02:14:52.870]  You want probably six hours a day direct sunlight. I mean they'll grow on less but
[02:14:53.590 --> 02:15:03.830]  for proper you want six plus. Big fat lush plants. Yeah. I'd prefer like 10 hours a day
[02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:09.910]  personally but I mean can make it work outdoors is really forgiving. So okay.
[02:15:11.110 --> 02:15:16.790]  They'll grow anywhere. Yeah they will. They'll grow on accident sometimes. So you want a south facing
[02:15:17.670 --> 02:15:22.310]  slope if you can. What if we're stuck like in the city? What if we're in the backyard? Do we want
[02:15:22.310 --> 02:15:28.950]  to avoid some sheds? Avoid street lights if you can? Street lights most definitely. Sheds you know
[02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:35.190]  you don't want to get too blocked in and that is mainly for airflow. I mean if your area is
[02:15:36.230 --> 02:15:40.230]  you know like in the middle of four sheds or something like that all stacked together
[02:15:40.230 --> 02:15:45.830]  but it's 20 by 20 you know you got plenty of airflow there for a couple plants. Leave some
[02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:50.470]  space for the plants to breathe. You know if it's like a six by six spot you know that's enough for
[02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:55.590]  one plant maybe. Right. Yeah you guys your outdoor plants are going to get big if you do this right
[02:15:55.590 --> 02:16:00.710]  and we'll talk about that in a few minutes when we talk about container size. So you would like a
[02:16:00.710 --> 02:16:05.270]  southern facing slope. If you're going to grow in your backyard or something don't grow between the
[02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:10.390]  garage and the house and the shed unless you can get plenty of air flowing through there.
[02:16:10.390 --> 02:16:13.350]  That's going to be a great show. Jesse's too high and my throat's all jacked. That's going to be
[02:16:13.350 --> 02:16:17.190]  wonderful. Make sure you get plenty of airflow. You don't want your plants touching each other.
[02:16:17.190 --> 02:16:22.230]  So when you do plant them make sure you give like expect the plants to be six to eight feet around
[02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:25.350]  each by the time you're done. Maybe a little bit bigger if you're a good grower and you know
[02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:30.790]  what you're doing. Yeah. So expect a big plant. Give yourself plenty of room is kind of what I
[02:16:30.790 --> 02:16:37.110]  was headed toward. So we might be behind on this question but here in Colorado when should we
[02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:42.070]  put our plants outside? Pretty much anywhere in America. I think you could have been out
[02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:51.830]  a couple of weeks ago probably. Oh easily. You know the summer we've had here locally
[02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:56.070]  you could have been out at first of May easily. I'm going to ask a really random question.
[02:16:56.710 --> 02:17:02.390]  Locally we've been getting beat to shit with hail. Yeah. Every for two weeks we had hail
[02:17:02.390 --> 02:17:07.510]  every night. How does one deal with torrential hailstorms like that in a ganja store in a ganja
[02:17:07.510 --> 02:17:14.390]  farm? You get real good at seeing hail storms coming. Okay. You put the tarps up. You watch
[02:17:14.470 --> 02:17:21.910]  the hail. Yeah. Tarps, buckets. That's with our in-ground plants the hail storm that actually
[02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:28.950]  hit our place we were able to put 55 gallon trash buckets over each of the plants. Okay. Just flip
[02:17:28.950 --> 02:17:34.950]  it upside down and give it a little hut. Yeah. Okay. Cool. You know if they were bigger further
[02:17:34.950 --> 02:17:38.710]  in the season. We'll talk about a hoop house in a minute. Sorry I didn't mean to interrupt you
[02:17:38.710 --> 02:17:43.590]  there really. No no you're good. Did the hoop house get fucked up from that hail?
[02:17:44.710 --> 02:17:50.310]  It had a shade cloth on it. Okay. So we'll talk about a hoop house toward the end. I'll write
[02:17:50.310 --> 02:17:55.190]  that down because we talked about it on a previous episode but we should kind of rewind on that one
[02:17:55.190 --> 02:18:00.950]  when we can. Last year it totally got fucked up by hail though. So it is very possible. So you guys
[02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:05.030]  you're going to fuck some shit up. Don't be afraid like shit's going to go wrong but you always get
[02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:11.270]  next year. Oh yeah. And you'll you'll you'll salvage something out of your harvest. Yeah you
[02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:16.470]  almost always get something. Unless thieves or cops. That's the only thing that's going to take
[02:18:16.470 --> 02:18:20.390]  it all. That's funny because I've got the word thieves and cops written on a note later on in
[02:18:20.390 --> 02:18:25.590]  this. I'm glad we're on the same page here. This is awesome. So we've got a few plants in
[02:18:26.230 --> 02:18:33.030]  a ideally ideally it would be on a field in Humboldt County or somewhere toward Gila or out
[02:18:33.030 --> 02:18:39.990]  in Rye on a south facing slope with a big 18 foot tall chain link fence where nobody can get in.
[02:18:40.870 --> 02:18:45.910]  But that's not always going to happen for you. We're going to want these plants plenty of space
[02:18:45.910 --> 02:18:49.270]  between them. You're going to want them outside. You're going to have to think about this weather.
[02:18:49.270 --> 02:18:53.030]  I'm kind of skipping ahead but Jesse said you can put them out now. Then I thought about all
[02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:57.670]  the weather we've been getting. Let's let's just go right to the hoop house. Let's talk about that.
[02:18:57.670 --> 02:19:03.190]  That seems to be the ideal outdoor. If people want to go outdoors cheap to protect everything
[02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:09.670]  I think a hoop house might be. Yeah that's also the best way to get the best resin
[02:19:11.430 --> 02:19:17.110]  production in my opinion. Just straight up outdoor tends to get dirty.
[02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:21.750]  If you're making concentrates you're going to make dust concentrate. Beaten by the sun,
[02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:30.230]  rained on, you know all that good stuff. A simple hoop house covering can save you a lot of
[02:19:30.230 --> 02:19:36.950]  headaches. It can create a couple too. As long as it's tall enough, you know, realize the strain
[02:19:36.950 --> 02:19:40.630]  you're going through. Do a little research. Figure out how much you're going to stretch.
[02:19:41.350 --> 02:19:49.190]  If you've done this before you know what's up. So plan for that. You're going to get big outside.
[02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:56.070]  Yeah plan for the size and make sure you have plenty of airflow at the top of the greenhouse
[02:19:56.070 --> 02:20:02.630]  and at the bottom. Fresh air in and old stale air out. It's just as important as in the grow.
[02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:08.070]  And the humid air too. That's because the plants are transpiring and the plastic traps the water
[02:20:08.070 --> 02:20:14.790]  in there. So that's you got to get that out of there. All right. Yeah. So let's real quickly,
[02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:19.670]  if you could describe to me how to build a, you know, just a hoop house that would fit in my
[02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:24.950]  backyard. You know maybe just like a 10 by 20 at the biggest. What would be the most, just you know,
[02:20:24.950 --> 02:20:28.070]  two or three minutes worth of how to build a hoop house? For sure. Real simple.
[02:20:31.350 --> 02:20:37.510]  I'm trying to think how simple. Start with the frame. The bottom. All right. So take like,
[02:20:38.310 --> 02:20:46.230]  what size did you say? Like a 10 by 20. 10 by 20. Get to 20. So you'll need 40 foot of lumber there
[02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:52.950]  or 30 foot of lumber there. No, I don't. Yeah. 60 foot. There you go. But I get you.
[02:20:54.550 --> 02:21:06.150]  I forgot to carry the two. So build your frame just like a big box. Secure it to the ground.
[02:21:06.150 --> 02:21:10.630]  You don't even have to secure it to the ground, but it'll help. The way it's been around here
[02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:18.150]  lately, I would secure it. And inside that frame, just bend your PVC tubes. You know,
[02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:23.830]  I'd use like probably 20 foot tube or something like, or 20 foot stick on that. And you know,
[02:21:23.830 --> 02:21:29.270]  that's going to end you up with, I think somewhere around a seven foot ceiling, I want to say. I'm
[02:21:29.270 --> 02:21:37.910]  not sure on that though. But, and then just continue down, you know, over a 20 foot span,
[02:21:37.910 --> 02:21:45.270]  you'd probably want, I'd recommend at least seven, probably go for more like eight or nine.
[02:21:45.270 --> 02:21:49.590]  So what we're doing, he's, so you've got a rectangle, you've got a rectangle, it's a 10 by
[02:21:49.590 --> 02:21:54.310]  20. And then what we're going to do, why we call it a hoop house, we're taking a PVC tubing. And
[02:21:54.310 --> 02:21:59.270]  it almost looks like you're just using hula hoops and building a long tube. You make an arch from,
[02:21:59.270 --> 02:22:03.910]  and we're doing it the 10 foot to 10 foot side, not the 20 inch or the 20 foot. So you go from
[02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:08.390]  one 10, you just make an arch and that way it makes it about seven feet tall and then it's 10
[02:22:08.390 --> 02:22:13.750]  feet wide. And then you do those about every two or three, three or four feet. Yeah. Depending on
[02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:22.710]  how much wind I, you know, here in the Prairie and Southern Colorado, I'd probably recommend it
[02:22:22.710 --> 02:22:29.190]  three foot. All right. So it's about every three feet, put a, put another PVC tube and attach that
[02:22:29.190 --> 02:22:36.550]  to the box somehow to your base. What do you use to attach it? Like a conduit clamp. Perfect.
[02:22:36.550 --> 02:22:41.590]  That's what I, yeah. And then I also run a lag bolt through there. I only run one bolt through
[02:22:41.590 --> 02:22:48.150]  there and I drill it out. I've had them, what would you call it? Wallow them, wallow their way
[02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:54.950]  out and it rips the PVC. And then that's always fun when you get a springboarded PVC pipe just
[02:22:55.510 --> 02:23:01.910]  flipping up in the middle of the night. Yeah. So. Catapult some shit across the grow. All right.
[02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:05.510]  So then you've got the supports going over and then do you put one across the middle?
[02:23:05.510 --> 02:23:12.310]  Yeah. I'd actually recommend three. So if you're thinking of it like a clock, there'd be one at 12
[02:23:12.310 --> 02:23:20.790]  o'clock, one at nine o'clock and one at, what would that be? Two or three. Yeah. Nine and three. All
[02:23:20.790 --> 02:23:25.750]  right. That makes sense. Okay. So they've got this like arch looking building with a beam that
[02:23:25.750 --> 02:23:30.870]  goes down the middle on the top and then down the three o'clock angle, down the nine o'clock angle.
[02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:37.430]  That feels pretty secure. How do you attach that top hole and the side, the beam to come across?
[02:23:39.350 --> 02:23:47.030]  Fence posts is the easiest way. Just dig a fence post at the end of each end of the greenhouse.
[02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:54.870]  On a 20 foot one, you might want one in the middle too. And just arrange the size so that it meets up
[02:23:54.870 --> 02:24:01.910]  with that skeleton beam and fasten it to it with more conduit clamps. Okay. Sounds like you've done
[02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:08.790]  this several dozen times. Yes. All right. So now pretty much looks like we've got the skeleton
[02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:13.910]  figured out basically. Right? Yeah. All right. Now, how do we, what do we use for a cover for a
[02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:18.150]  top for this thing to keep the hail and rain off of our beautiful plants? It depends on your budget.
[02:24:19.350 --> 02:24:32.630]  If you're low in budget, a visqueen or just poly plastic from those works great. Get the heavier,
[02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:41.110]  thicker mill. And if you've got a better budget, we sell greenhouse fabrics. Lots of places sell
[02:24:41.110 --> 02:24:49.990]  greenhouse fabrics. And it ranges, I want to say it's somewhere, hell, I don't even know. I know
[02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:54.790]  it goes up to like 10 bucks a square foot. So, I mean, it starts off way cheaper than that. Okay.
[02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:59.350]  But 10 is high? Yeah. Okay. So you guys, you can afford this. If you guys work a little bit
[02:24:59.350 --> 02:25:03.270]  through the winter, you can build this next summer and you can definitely have you an outdoor.
[02:25:03.270 --> 02:25:07.750]  All right. So now we covered up. How do you secure the cover there?
[02:25:11.030 --> 02:25:20.230]  What do they call them? It looks like a battery jumper cable clamp. Okay. A little alligator
[02:25:20.230 --> 02:25:24.550]  clamp. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But better, but stronger. We call them spring clamps, but I don't think
[02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:30.310]  that's what the... The nipple clamps. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Framing clamps. All right. All right. So
[02:25:30.310 --> 02:25:34.950]  that makes a lot of sense. Yeah. We get them for like 250 at Harbor Freight. All right. So go buy
[02:25:34.950 --> 02:25:38.470]  a whole bucket of those things. Yeah, literally. I've gotten in there and bought like four buckets
[02:25:38.470 --> 02:25:44.470]  of them. Yeah. What are you doing? Don't ask, lady. Don't ask. Yeah. All right. So you got this
[02:25:44.470 --> 02:25:49.510]  little hoop house. You should put a fan in the top, guys. Like in one of the peaks at the end,
[02:25:49.510 --> 02:25:53.990]  cut out the shape of the fan and hang a fan in there because you're going to need to get some
[02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:59.270]  air in and out. If you can do a blower, like a grow room blower, that's even cooler. Those work
[02:25:59.270 --> 02:26:04.390]  great on the ground. Okay. Do one coming in? Yeah. One thing that sucks about those is though
[02:26:05.110 --> 02:26:10.950]  they suck up rocks and a lot of them have plastic blades in them. So take you a piece of ducting
[02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:16.310]  that's, I don't know, like three foot long and secure it to the side of the greenhouse,
[02:26:16.310 --> 02:26:21.270]  lift it up a little bit higher, attach it to the fan so that it can't suck any rocks off.
[02:26:21.270 --> 02:26:25.030]  Yeah. Oh man. I can just... I don't want to know what that sounds like.
[02:26:25.750 --> 02:26:29.430]  Yeah. It's fun. It sounds like he's in the blender, I could imagine.
[02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:33.350]  All right. So we've got air in, we've got air out, we've got a nice little
[02:26:33.350 --> 02:26:38.230]  greenhouse. I don't want... I'm going to save that question right there. What kind of soil
[02:26:38.230 --> 02:26:43.910]  should we use? That depends on your budget and just your grow style. Really, I mean...
[02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:46.870]  Should we put them straight into the dirt, do you think, or should we use pots?
[02:26:47.350 --> 02:26:53.830]  It also depends on your location. I would tend to recommend pots, even though I would rather be
[02:26:53.830 --> 02:27:00.630]  able to recommend planting in the ground, but there's a little more to that. If you go get
[02:27:00.630 --> 02:27:09.590]  like a 30 gallon smart pot, outdoors, I recommend the fabric pots. And they sell the tan ones now
[02:27:09.590 --> 02:27:15.190]  too, which are great because they reflect heat a little better than the black ones that tend to
[02:27:15.190 --> 02:27:23.270]  absorb heat. But if you just went with your favorite potting soil, I recommend probably
[02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:25.990]  going three times bigger than your typical indoor container.
[02:27:25.990 --> 02:27:29.830]  Okay. Large containers for outdoors, I guess. Large containers.
[02:27:29.830 --> 02:27:33.750]  Stick with your regular nutrient schedule, stick with what you're comfortable with.
[02:27:33.910 --> 02:27:38.310]  If you want to do organics, I could spend a whole episode talking about...
[02:27:38.310 --> 02:27:42.550]  There are some episodes with Sean, you guys, that are all about amending soil and there are
[02:27:42.550 --> 02:27:43.910]  great outdoor mixes in there.
[02:27:43.910 --> 02:27:49.590]  I mean, that's personally the way I grow. Half of my plant... I mean, we do six plants in the
[02:27:49.590 --> 02:27:55.190]  ground and we do six plants in the light depth greenhouse. The ones in the ground have been
[02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:58.230]  in that... I've been growing in that soil for a long time.
[02:27:58.230 --> 02:28:05.270]  The ones in the greenhouse get my homemade mixture, which is real similar to, I don't know,
[02:28:05.270 --> 02:28:05.830]  roots.
[02:28:05.830 --> 02:28:07.670]  Okay. Roots organic is good stuff.
[02:28:07.670 --> 02:28:08.230]  Yeah.
[02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.790]  All right.
[02:28:08.790 --> 02:28:14.150]  And they get... Personally, I grow organic, so they get teas and I've been playing around with
[02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:15.670]  ferments and stuff like that.
[02:28:15.670 --> 02:28:17.910]  Don't they love a nice tea? Oh man.
[02:28:17.910 --> 02:28:18.470]  Yes.
[02:28:18.470 --> 02:28:21.670]  You can see the growth. If you feel like you're going to get a little bit of a tea,
[02:28:21.670 --> 02:28:22.950]  you can go to the organic side.
[02:28:22.950 --> 02:28:23.270]  Yeah.
[02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:29.910]  All right. So now we've got these plants in a nice Kashi juice. Oh, I could go off on a whole
[02:28:29.910 --> 02:28:33.670]  rant about that. That one, it almost flew over my head, but that's Kashi juice.
[02:28:33.670 --> 02:28:37.030]  I still don't know what... What is that? Lab?
[02:28:37.030 --> 02:28:38.310]  Lactic acid bacteria.
[02:28:38.310 --> 02:28:38.630]  Yeah.
[02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.950]  Yeah.
[02:28:38.950 --> 02:28:43.110]  And it's that purple stuff and the fungi stuff looking stuff is basically great white.
[02:28:43.110 --> 02:28:43.590]  Oh yeah.
[02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:44.870]  You're making your own great white shark.
[02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:45.670]  I have all these things.
[02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.990]  Yeah.
[02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:48.550]  So, I'm going to go ahead and throw in a little bit of that Kashi juice.
[02:28:48.550 --> 02:28:48.790]  Yeah.
[02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:58.790]  Oh, dude, it smells like vomit. It smells like beer, bar trash can puke.
[02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:59.110]  Yeah.
[02:28:59.110 --> 02:29:04.470]  But yeah. All right. So we've got this nice little light depth greenhouse. We've got some
[02:29:04.470 --> 02:29:08.790]  plants in really large pots or not light depth. It's just a little hoop house. I mean, we didn't
[02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:11.990]  do light depth on this episode. We may discuss that a little more in the future. We've done it
[02:29:11.990 --> 02:29:13.270]  once. We may cover it again for you.
[02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:17.590]  If you're interested in light depth, it's... You put the plastic on, you take it off.
[02:29:17.590 --> 02:29:18.470]  Yeah.
[02:29:19.350 --> 02:29:23.590]  You get another tarp to cover up the sun so that you can schedule the bitches to go to sleep.
[02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:29.670]  It's like digging ditches. You could teach anyone to do it. So, and we talk about it in a past
[02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:30.390]  episode.
[02:29:30.390 --> 02:29:35.830]  Yeah. We'll go more over that one in the future also. So you got them in this little hoop house.
[02:29:35.830 --> 02:29:41.750]  You've got large pots with decent soil. You're feeding nutrients that you're familiar with or
[02:29:41.750 --> 02:29:47.110]  a bottle nutrient line, because that's probably cost-effective. If not, our friend, Sean,
[02:29:47.110 --> 02:29:51.670]  will teach you a great soil recipe. I'll find the episode number and insert that in the notes.
[02:29:53.030 --> 02:29:55.670]  Outdoor plants tend to use a little more food.
[02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:57.430]  Okay.
[02:29:57.430 --> 02:30:03.910]  When I've grown bottled nutrients outdoors, we normally feed to the top end of the recommendation
[02:30:03.910 --> 02:30:10.230]  if maybe even just a little over. This was with general organic specifically.
[02:30:10.230 --> 02:30:14.310]  Okay. Yeah. Because the plants can metabolize more because of the sun and the more available
[02:30:14.310 --> 02:30:16.950]  CO2 and the bigger root mass. So, okay.
[02:30:16.950 --> 02:30:19.430]  You think your Govitas are badass? They ain't got nothing on that.
[02:30:19.430 --> 02:30:24.710]  Yeah. The sun will kick your Govitas ass. Somebody asked me what kind of lights to use. And I was
[02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:29.190]  like, Govitas. And they're like, I've got low ceilings. I was like, yeah, stick with your
[02:30:29.190 --> 02:30:31.030]  like Lumitex or whatever you're using.
[02:30:31.030 --> 02:30:31.670]  Yeah.
[02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:37.350]  Yeah. Those Magnums or whatever. All right. So now when should we expect to see signs of flower?
[02:30:39.110 --> 02:30:41.830]  Late July, early August in Southern Colorado.
[02:30:41.830 --> 02:30:43.910]  Depends on what strains we're working with. I'd imagine.
[02:30:43.910 --> 02:30:50.710]  That too. Indica seems to tend, or I would say in my experience, Indica's go a little quicker
[02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:51.590]  around here. So.
[02:30:51.590 --> 02:30:56.310]  Very true. The flow will take off. Blueberry will be almost done by the time Golden Goat spits out
[02:30:56.310 --> 02:30:56.790]  pistils.
[02:30:57.350 --> 02:31:02.550]  My government mule just kills it outdoors. Like it's great.
[02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:08.550]  All right. So speaking of mules, I'm just joking. That is kind of good though. What
[02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:12.230]  kind of problems do you think we should tell the people to be prepared for?
[02:31:14.630 --> 02:31:16.790]  We get those damn little moths.
[02:31:16.790 --> 02:31:17.750]  Oh yeah.
[02:31:17.750 --> 02:31:19.510]  And they lay eggs.
[02:31:19.510 --> 02:31:20.790]  Turn into caterpillars.
[02:31:21.430 --> 02:31:28.950]  Yeah. And they bore into your bud. If you're doing light dip and it's early season,
[02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:34.470]  you got to watch out for molds, bud rot, stuff like that.
[02:31:36.310 --> 02:31:38.710]  Is that something that can be stopped once it's happened?
[02:31:39.670 --> 02:31:46.710]  Um, mold. Um, I mean, we could spend, well, I don't know if PMs of a bastard.
[02:31:46.710 --> 02:31:48.310]  Yes, I agree.
[02:31:48.310 --> 02:31:54.790]  Um, I mean, I personally don't think, you know, a little on a family here or there right before
[02:31:54.790 --> 02:31:58.230]  harvest is one thing. If it's on the bud, it's done in my opinion.
[02:31:58.230 --> 02:31:59.030]  I agree.
[02:31:59.030 --> 02:32:06.950]  Bud rot. Um, I have just seen that for the first time this year ever. Um, and it was in,
[02:32:07.270 --> 02:32:11.750]  it was in another light dip. Um, they didn't have good air circulation. Um,
[02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:15.110]  once again, guys get that circulation up.
[02:32:15.110 --> 02:32:22.150]  We've had a very rainy spring, um, and lots of hell and everything. It's just the humidity has
[02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:28.230]  been so much higher than a lot of outdoor growers are used to dealing with, um, around here.
[02:32:28.230 --> 02:32:31.910]  Yeah. So, and we're using swamp coolers to try to cool the house on top of that.
[02:32:32.310 --> 02:32:37.750]  His loss or his harvest was by no means a total loss. Um, you know, he probably
[02:32:38.550 --> 02:32:43.430]  lost a plant, you know, combined out of, I think he did 12 plants in there or something like that.
[02:32:43.430 --> 02:32:48.710]  So that's not bad. Yeah. I mean, that's the, the rule of averages with growing weed.
[02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:52.790]  It's not like it was PM where like, you can smell it on
[02:32:52.790 --> 02:32:57.270]  buds that weren't even affected and stuff like that. Like, or at least what I've seen so far.
[02:32:57.670 --> 02:33:02.070]  Uh, how do we deal with animals? What kind of animals do you think we're going to get?
[02:33:02.070 --> 02:33:09.510]  Um, you know, it depends on where you live. Um, deer love it. Cows love it. Every,
[02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:14.790]  everything that eats stuff, loves it. Um, especially when it's well cared for. So,
[02:33:16.230 --> 02:33:22.550]  um, if you know, you know, just prepare for the animals in your area. Um, even cats and dogs,
[02:33:22.790 --> 02:33:27.590]  say cats, rabbits, squirrels, all the domestic fucking pest animals are going to come at it too.
[02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:32.310]  So be prepared somehow, like you got to section it off somehow. So these animals don't get to it.
[02:33:32.310 --> 02:33:36.790]  Should we treat for bugs outdoors? My theory on outdoor growing, and you can correct me if I'm
[02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:40.710]  wrong. You're the outdoor guy. I feel like if we don't fuck with nature, nature will kind of take
[02:33:40.710 --> 02:33:45.830]  care of itself for us. Like, I feel like if I spray, I'm going to upset the whole system and
[02:33:45.830 --> 02:33:49.430]  a bug that wouldn't normally dominate will dominate because whatever should have been
[02:33:49.430 --> 02:33:53.990]  there to eat it will be gone. Is that kind of right? And like where I grow, I totally agree
[02:33:53.990 --> 02:34:02.950]  with that. Um, we use very minimal pesticides, um, very strategic timing, um, in a greenhouse.
[02:34:03.510 --> 02:34:09.110]  Um, you know, it depends on how sealed up your greenhouses. Um, a lot of times it's just like
[02:34:09.110 --> 02:34:19.030]  a girl room environment. Um, so, uh, just don't overdo it. You know, it's, um, it is a lot harder
[02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:26.390]  for insects and parasites to survive outside. Um, I mean, it's the best grow room in the world. It's,
[02:34:26.390 --> 02:34:32.390]  it's got perfect air flow and everything. So, and the sun, as long as the plants are happy,
[02:34:32.390 --> 02:34:37.430]  aren't stressed out, you know, I think A's and Mac's probably the strongest thing I've
[02:34:37.430 --> 02:34:42.470]  ever used outdoors. How do you feel about a spinosad? Uh, that's great stuff. Uh, that's
[02:34:42.470 --> 02:34:47.350]  something you can do to go after the moths and stuff like that. Uh, that's a something, I mean,
[02:34:47.350 --> 02:34:53.830]  we have bees on our property too. So that's a, you know, always a consideration. Um, but spinosad
[02:34:53.830 --> 02:34:59.590]  is something that, you know, we don't really worry about it at all. Um, it's, it's totally natural.
[02:34:59.590 --> 02:35:04.950]  It's like spraying the tea on the plants, which we do. It's actually a, it derives from a bacteria
[02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:13.110]  found in the bottle of a rum jar or the bottom of a rum jar or a rum barrel. I think the wood
[02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:17.430]  has something to do with it. Yeah, for sure. For sure. I read that a long time ago somewhere.
[02:35:17.430 --> 02:35:23.670]  All right. Uh, so captain Jack's yeah. Captain Jack's to the rescue sometimes. So we talked
[02:35:23.670 --> 02:35:27.590]  about all the weather you guys be prepared for a lot of weather. You're going to get heat. You're
[02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:32.310]  going to get hail. You're going to get rain. You're going to get wind. It's going to be treacherous
[02:35:32.310 --> 02:35:36.550]  out there. Uh, imagine being stuck outside all the time and not being able to come inside. You're
[02:35:36.550 --> 02:35:40.630]  going to have to prepare for your plants. You need to build them in a dog house or something.
[02:35:40.630 --> 02:35:45.190]  They need love. All right. Also something I thought we should mention is be prepared for a
[02:35:45.190 --> 02:35:49.910]  lot of watering. I don't know if you guys are prepared or realize how much water your outdoor
[02:35:49.910 --> 02:35:56.630]  plants are going to take. Uh, how often do you water your outdoor plants, Jesse? Um, well,
[02:35:57.270 --> 02:36:03.510]  up until, you know, normally it's once a day. Um, this year has been a little different. I haven't
[02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:07.990]  had to water as much. We've gotten a lot of rain. It's actually been a pain in the fucking ass.
[02:36:08.950 --> 02:36:15.110]  Some of my plants are severely stunted because of it. So, um, don't catch up though. So yeah,
[02:36:15.110 --> 02:36:20.550]  it'll dry out here pretty soon. Yeah. Yeah. We'll be missing that evening rain. Yeah. So, uh,
[02:36:21.430 --> 02:36:24.790]  what else was I going to ask you in the middle of flowering when they start budding out in the
[02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:30.390]  summer? Are you going to be watering them twice? Uh, probably so. Um, in-ground plants don't
[02:36:31.430 --> 02:36:39.430]  need to be watered as much if you water them right, you know, um, 15, 20 gallons at a time.
[02:36:39.430 --> 02:36:48.470]  Um, it's, it's a workout when we do, um, outdoor in-ground water. Um, in the greenhouse,
[02:36:48.470 --> 02:36:54.470]  I use the automated system. So I put a little sprinklers and everything and yeah,
[02:36:55.190 --> 02:37:02.710]  yeah. Screw that shit. Um, but that just tells you how much water, um, you know, even smart
[02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:09.910]  pots need outdoors. Um, the, the sun just bakes those pots, uh, guttalose or something like that.
[02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:14.870]  Just fill the side of one of their, you know, of a rose pot or something like that sitting outside.
[02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:21.910]  Um, and I mean, this, the sun just bakes it, it gets so fucking hot and that gets your roots hot,
[02:37:21.910 --> 02:37:26.710]  um, which they can survive. They just need plenty of water to be able to handle it. So,
[02:37:26.710 --> 02:37:31.350]  okay. Um, also you said to put mulch on top of your pots also to kind of shade them a little,
[02:37:31.350 --> 02:37:37.990]  keep moisture in. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, in-ground or in the pots. Um, another thing, if you do have
[02:37:37.990 --> 02:37:44.230]  black pots outside, I recommend, uh, wrapping them in panda plastic with the white side out.
[02:37:44.230 --> 02:37:50.310]  Okay. Make them a little reflective. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I did that three, started doing that
[02:37:50.310 --> 02:37:55.670]  three years ago and it seemed to make a difference. So that's, yeah. Um, what I'd like
[02:37:55.670 --> 02:38:01.510]  to figure out for these people is, uh, some no-till, um, talk with Sean, some future stuff
[02:38:01.510 --> 02:38:06.230]  about it. So yeah, no-till is neat. I've been looking into that. This year it was kind of a
[02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:11.270]  last minute opportunity for them. So once they got the required licensing and everything,
[02:38:11.270 --> 02:38:15.910]  they just went with what they had. So, um, which wasn't much.
[02:38:16.310 --> 02:38:20.710]  All right. Before my computer starts tripping out too much here, uh, do you have any tips for the
[02:38:20.710 --> 02:38:23.030]  people that are starting to grow outdoors for the first time this year?
[02:38:23.030 --> 02:38:31.830]  Um, water a lot. Um, if you're in ground, um, just make sure the water's soaking down into the soil.
[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:37.990]  Um, once it starts pulling up, um, give it a minute, you know, see how long it takes it for
[02:38:37.990 --> 02:38:44.870]  it to drain down into the soil that they gives you a real good indication of, um, how long it takes
[02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:51.350]  how damp the soil is. Cause you know, a container is easy. You just got to pick it up. Um, you know,
[02:38:51.350 --> 02:38:57.350]  and you should be able to through trial and error, figure out how, uh, how much water to put in it,
[02:38:57.350 --> 02:39:02.310]  how much it should weigh, how long it takes to dry out. Um, the, the earth can be a little more
[02:39:02.310 --> 02:39:09.910]  challenging, um, uh, to aid in that watering, put a frame around the plant, like a three foot by
[02:39:09.910 --> 02:39:16.470]  three foot, two by four frame and just put it on the ground. You can also attach, uh, the big crazy,
[02:39:17.190 --> 02:39:22.630]  uh, tomato cages or, you know, plant cages made out of fencing to them later on. So
[02:39:23.350 --> 02:39:26.790]  prune them out and pull them out a little bit, get light down in, okay.
[02:39:26.790 --> 02:39:31.670]  I'm getting a frog in my throat. Well, uh, let's, uh, let's wrap it up. We've been going for
[02:39:31.670 --> 02:39:35.590]  30 minutes now. That's enough of a podcast for these guys. We'll let your throat take a break.
[02:39:35.590 --> 02:39:39.110]  My throat finally is not blown out. So it's a good time to do a closing here.
[02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:43.110]  Take some dabs. Yeah, we'll take some dabs. Now we'll save some stuff for next time here.
[02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:47.270]  Uh, you guys, thanks again for listening to another episode. I will probably be back in
