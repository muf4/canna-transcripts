[00:01.150 --> 00:05.510]  I don't know about you guys, but I've been walking around singing Nobel, Nebraska for like a week now
[00:11.510 --> 00:14.850]  Yeah, the only downfall is they used a lot of
[00:17.270 --> 00:21.390]  Inside jokes, you know like and they tried to explain them to the best of the ability
[00:21.390 --> 00:26.310]  But it's it's more one of those things you had to been there. I was just laughing every time
[00:26.310 --> 00:33.110]  They would say something like ham wallet or some the ham wallet in the beginning was I don't it got pushed off like it
[00:33.110 --> 00:34.730]  Wasn't anything that was the idea
[00:34.730 --> 00:39.050]  I was letting shit just slide by because the more I was like, ah shit the more it came out
[00:39.050 --> 00:41.870]  It was fun to do but it was fun. Just letting some shit slide, too
[00:41.870 --> 00:48.950]  And you you would hear one of them like every everyone throughout the podcast like you edit this right like just a little bit
[00:49.790 --> 00:52.350]  No, no, I just I'm too lazy for that
[00:52.710 --> 00:56.550]  Three hours with those guys and I just cut out an hour and 20 right out of the middle
[00:56.550 --> 01:00.630]  They started playing no mountain. I was like, I'm gonna record from here. You guys are getting recorded
[01:00.630 --> 01:05.110]  They didn't know I'd been recording for like a full hour kind of like you guys don't realize I've been recording for at least a
[01:05.110 --> 01:09.190]  Minute. Hey, you guys ready to do a podcast? I am ready. Let's do this. I'm gonna drop in the intro song

[02:04.250 --> 02:08.290]  DTFO I'm dabbed the fuck out today been dabbing on some turpex shatter
[02:08.290 --> 02:11.130]  I also got some black cherry chem shatter from the Garden of Weden
[02:11.130 --> 02:16.530]  It's been a good day when when what day is it that you're not dabbed the fuck out though. I mean
[02:17.690 --> 02:24.290]  Early in the day early early in the early in the Merlin. Yeah, I don't know people are I surprisingly don't dab early in the morning
[02:24.290 --> 02:27.690]  I'm not an early morning dabber. I try to wait until I at least get a few things done
[02:27.690 --> 02:32.370]  Yeah, I mean I've come over here a couple times and it's like 710, you know first one of the day
[02:32.370 --> 02:37.050]  Yeah, you got to do work before you dab out. I get uh, if I dab too early I get lazy
[02:37.050 --> 02:38.250]  I just want to go right back to bed
[02:38.250 --> 02:42.210]  And then if I dab during work when I'm trying to get a lot of shit done, I just get out of focus
[02:42.610 --> 02:44.610]  I'll do the same thing to myself a flower
[02:44.770 --> 02:45.490]  Yeah, right
[02:45.490 --> 02:51.850]  Just try to wait and reward yourself a little if I grateful dog right after breakfast like it's gonna be a real productive day
[02:51.850 --> 02:54.410]  Yeah, yeah, my buddy Mitch and also shout out Mitch
[02:54.410 --> 02:58.890]  He said that when you're dabbing every hour becomes 45 minutes of productive time
[02:59.130 --> 03:05.130]  So then I kind of believe him I would have agree I would argue with that between sativa and Anika
[03:05.130 --> 03:10.970]  You know I'm saying like you're a real big sativa guy and usually if I come over here and get real ripped off sativa dabs
[03:10.970 --> 03:13.810]  I don't go home and like no, I'm like, what can we clean?
[03:14.450 --> 03:16.930]  Where where do we need to I kind of get that way?
[03:16.930 --> 03:22.170]  But I end up doing some useless shit like something that even need to be done. My desk is organized
[03:22.170 --> 03:25.970]  Yeah, completely organized all the dishes are perfectly clean in the kitchen, but it was useless
[03:25.970 --> 03:31.610]  I should have been doing way different stuff at the time. Yeah without a good sativa though the spring clean
[03:31.610 --> 03:37.570]  That just happened at my house would not have happened true that sure a lot of stuff got extra attention that it definitely didn't deserve
[03:37.970 --> 03:42.770]  Like all of my books didn't need to be pulled out and dusted and put back on a shelf, but it happened
[03:42.770 --> 03:47.570]  Yeah, that's the shit that some dabs will do to you. Yeah, that was a little too much sativa when I catch myself
[03:47.690 --> 03:51.890]  I'll take a dab and then I don't know how I do it, but I'm on Instagram suddenly
[03:52.890 --> 03:58.890]  I'm standing just in the middle of a hallway or in the middle of the kitchen or people are just flowing around you
[03:58.890 --> 04:03.730]  Yeah, and I'm just Instagram and like a motherfucker and don't even know it like what was going on here in my head a minute
[04:03.730 --> 04:09.590]  Ago, and what am I supposed to be doing? So I don't dab during the day sometimes but when I do bro a dab
[04:09.930 --> 04:12.290]  Once I start dabbing it's game on
[04:13.050 --> 04:15.690]  Keep your dabs per hour high once you start right?
[04:16.690 --> 04:21.290]  DPH deep that sounds dirty. Don't say like that. Don't say like that
[04:21.530 --> 04:25.970]  Guys, we're gonna talk about I've got some news articles. I want to read we're gonna talk about some Jamaican stuff
[04:25.970 --> 04:30.210]  I'm gonna mention something about ladybugs that a listener emailed me about
[04:30.810 --> 04:33.570]  And if we have time I might talk about my Bokashi bucket
[04:33.570 --> 04:36.610]  I'm not sure how far we're gonna get with all the news articles that I found
[04:36.990 --> 04:40.050]  One thing I do want to mention. It's our birthday. What?
[04:42.010 --> 04:44.010]  Anniversary of the podcast. Thanks Mike great
[04:44.530 --> 04:46.530]  I was wondering when this was actually
[04:46.690 --> 04:49.810]  Know how you were gonna do it. This will be out like March 29th
[04:49.810 --> 04:55.010]  I think and I think today the 28th is the day that the first episode was ever released awesome
[04:55.010 --> 05:00.770]  So let's let's take some dabs for the birthday and then some commercials. All righty. Um, I'll give you guys the option
[05:00.770 --> 05:04.930]  I've got some SF VO G. I've got gorilla glue and I've got lemonade
[05:06.250 --> 05:08.250]  Which one should we dab here?
[05:08.490 --> 05:15.330]  you already know that I'm gonna pitch towards the SFV because it is a it is a dank strain from turpex and
[05:16.250 --> 05:18.870]  Yeah, you said lemonade in my tongue to the thing
[05:20.730 --> 05:23.770]  Yet so I mean I'm sure that by the end of the show we're gonna dab all three
[05:23.770 --> 05:28.410]  Let's start with the SFV and then we got to give my little baby dabs, but we'll start with the SFV
[05:29.210 --> 05:32.330]  This is the San Fernando Valley Kush made popular
[05:32.330 --> 05:37.770]  I don't even know it's really popular from the Cali connection is who put out the seeds
[05:37.770 --> 05:40.250]  But people are gonna be like they didn't make it popular
[05:40.970 --> 05:47.010]  But they put out the seeds of the SFV and it's a great breeding strain it tastes good. It's a super nice high
[05:47.730 --> 05:54.450]  Turpex blasted extracted this and everything turpex does is quality. They change their labels. I like their new logo shout out
[05:54.450 --> 05:57.930]  Also, check out their new website and they do a hell of a job, dude
[05:57.930 --> 06:03.370]  I have been driving around in my car and just randomly like I've got Tourette's I'd like no, I'm out, Nebraska
[06:04.130 --> 06:06.330]  For the past seven to ten days. Oh
[06:07.450 --> 06:09.450]  My wife has no idea my wife
[06:10.770 --> 06:12.770]  But
[06:13.170 --> 06:18.290]  She has no idea what it is, but she's definitely heard it like every time I'm sitting in there hitting the bowl
[06:18.290 --> 06:21.170]  It's it just it comes out whether there's no melt or not
[06:21.770 --> 06:29.050]  So yeah, I've got maybe another day before I get the deadpan look from my alright stop pause the song explain
[06:29.050 --> 06:31.050]  What the fuck are they talking about?
[06:32.130 --> 06:34.370]  Yeah, as I was setting up for the podcast
[06:34.370 --> 06:37.870]  I was reading a news article and Mike just I'm gonna give you a listen and hit play
[06:38.590 --> 06:42.630]  Oh shit, okay, and he's playing the no melt theme song in the intro in my head
[06:42.630 --> 06:45.030]  And I've got it. You got to play it to get out of your head, right?
[06:45.030 --> 06:48.590]  Yeah, you download it to your phone. Don't you see you have it forever? Yep. You have it forever
[06:49.190 --> 06:53.730]  Yeah, that would be is that song number three on your phone? Because I know your playlist
[06:53.730 --> 06:59.090]  Okay, like most of the episodes of the podcast and then I have that new afro man cut
[06:59.550 --> 07:02.870]  Because I got high because that's just that's the only song on your phone, right?
[07:03.390 --> 07:05.390]  I'm gonna put some order back to this show
[07:05.390 --> 07:07.390]  The
[07:07.510 --> 07:09.350]  SFV were Gavin
[07:09.350 --> 07:13.430]  It tastes delicious. It made me cough a little that's my fault as a big dab. It tastes really
[07:14.510 --> 07:16.910]  It's earthy cushy. Maybe a hint of coffee
[07:19.150 --> 07:22.590]  Yeah, it's got a good nice earthy cushy flavor I definitely approve I like it
[07:23.230 --> 07:28.510]  It's not a sativa. That's for sure. It made my eyes go and it made me get a little slow. I
[07:29.750 --> 07:32.390]  Approve I approve. I'm gonna have to smoke a sativa here in a minute
[07:33.390 --> 07:37.630]  Interested in this lemonade my new favorite turp extreme at least this run this time
[07:38.230 --> 07:41.670]  I smoked quite a bit as if II between the water hash and was the
[07:42.510 --> 07:48.750]  What the buddies what my buddy smoke, you know? Yeah the last I got four grand. I got four flavors last time
[07:48.750 --> 07:52.030]  I got the lemonade. I got the chem dog the gorilla glue and
[07:52.670 --> 07:59.630]  The one I got was the chem and G. Oh, yeah, and that chem G was it's gone now if that tells you anything, right?
[07:59.670 --> 08:03.110]  It was my favorite dude. It was so turpid that nectar was good
[08:03.110 --> 08:09.710]  Then that was it was definitely delicious the flavor on it was insane flavor on this is pretty killer to the flavor of that chemin
[08:09.710 --> 08:16.110]  Stuff was I didn't I noticed through this like I mean, I didn't just hack off of that and when a huge dad but
[08:16.630 --> 08:18.630]  this
[08:18.630 --> 08:24.030]  In it. Yeah, it made me feel in it. Yeah, it made me feel good. So I was yeah, I'm nice and mellow now
[08:24.030 --> 08:25.550]  I definitely have heavy eyes
[08:25.550 --> 08:30.630]  I've noticed that I don't get the eye high from dabs like I used to and I would smoke just flowers in red or
[08:31.350 --> 08:36.510]  You know neat that your eyes just get droopy and they just feel like fucking back in the day, dude
[08:36.510 --> 08:40.670]  Your eyes would just get so heavy and everyone would look at you and be like you're so high bro. Open your eyes
[08:40.670 --> 08:42.270]  You know like I can't
[08:42.270 --> 08:46.870]  Dad seemed to make me bug-eyed like it's so intense that I'm like, I'm on edge with it
[08:46.870 --> 08:49.930]  I would kind of miss the the eye high and I'm getting that from this
[08:50.550 --> 08:52.230]  SFE right now
[08:52.230 --> 08:56.990]  All right while I'm dabbed out issue that everybody get a dab you got one right you're not coughing dude what happened
[08:57.750 --> 09:01.390]  Appropriately sized dab. Yeah, Mike's got to take dabs for ants over there tiny
[09:02.350 --> 09:07.150]  We've been rambling for a minute. I do need to do two commercials. Somebody's gonna shout out to burn

[09:52.470 --> 09:54.470]  You said we are
[09:54.470 --> 09:58.510]  I think we all kind of are part of high grow because we all love burn and burns
[09:58.510 --> 09:59.550]  It's my brother man
[09:59.550 --> 10:04.950]  Jesse's our brother but burns a young lady who weighs like a hundred pounds and they get a truck dropped off and they just
[10:04.950 --> 10:07.310]  Throw the truck out there and they're like, here's all your shit burn

[10:28.550 --> 10:30.030]  I don't know what it'll be yet
[10:30.030 --> 10:34.070]  Jesse and I will collaborate and talk about what needs to be discussed if you've got an idea and

[10:42.670 --> 10:46.170]  And I felt like at the last grow meeting like a lot of stuff was talked about
[10:46.750 --> 10:49.710]  Pretense, but then when it came down to who's got any questions
[10:49.710 --> 10:53.390]  Everybody was maybe a little embarrassed to speak up in front of the crowd and it wasn't
[10:53.950 --> 10:58.350]  It's because you're in a community of growers and I don't think that should be the place to be embarrassed
[10:58.350 --> 11:00.110]  That's the place to get help
[11:00.110 --> 11:04.190]  Yeah, but nobody wanted to show that there were yellow belts when there were fifth degree black belts in the room
[11:04.190 --> 11:08.590]  Absolutely a lot of talent there. It would have been rough to be the first kid to say I've got a
[11:09.550 --> 11:13.790]  Question recommended that we write down questions and put them in a hat and that way nobody knows
[11:14.230 --> 11:17.070]  Yeah, nobody knows who brought us that the silly-ass question
[11:22.230 --> 11:24.070]  We got a
[11:24.070 --> 11:27.350]  Whole reason meeting is to spread knowledge to everybody I had training

[12:36.830 --> 12:43.130]  Taking my old soil out of the pot and putting it into the recycling bin for soil. It's a serious privilege bitches
[12:43.670 --> 12:46.990]  Dear Tay mover. Yeah, I get to play with dirt all day
[12:47.630 --> 12:54.470]  Did you see and in the past 20 pots that we have harvested? Have you seen a massive increase in my root mass?
[12:54.870 --> 12:59.750]  Yeah, the the amount of root material in these pots is insane lately people
[13:00.190 --> 13:02.190]  I've been breaking up dirt pots for
[13:03.590 --> 13:06.270]  Disgustingly long about a time now that I think about it, but
[13:07.670 --> 13:10.230]  everybody's been breaking up a whole pot and had like a
[13:10.950 --> 13:16.750]  Handful a little tiny sad ass root there and lately you've got to smash the root ball against a wall for a little bit just to
[13:16.750 --> 13:18.350]  Get some dirt back
[13:18.350 --> 13:22.350]  It's been intense and they're not in there any longer. You're gonna say we just let them grow more time
[13:22.350 --> 13:26.350]  No, they're actually in there shorter because I ran this crop really quickly. I wanted to get some
[13:27.150 --> 13:28.470]  They're not getting root bound
[13:28.470 --> 13:34.710]  There's just an insane amount of incredibly healthy root material and see that's kind of what I was pointing at is like if you were using
[13:34.710 --> 13:38.670]  That would it be better to kind of transplant more?
[13:39.430 --> 13:41.070]  you know
[13:41.070 --> 13:42.670]  more often or
[13:42.670 --> 13:49.750]  Just because we don't a larger pot would have been helpful, but it wasn't necessary. It wasn't to that point a larger pot from the get-go
[13:49.750 --> 13:54.110]  I wouldn't necessarily say transplanting more frequently would be a good thing. There's a lot of stress
[13:54.990 --> 13:58.630]  But you know, we've gotten it down not to brag on ourselves
[13:58.630 --> 14:03.910]  We're gonna transplant some shit where there's like zero stress where the plants are even happier. They're like, oh, that was great
[14:04.550 --> 14:08.990]  Yeah, just get to stretch a little more at the right. Yeah. So once you guys get comfortable, I like to go myself
[14:08.990 --> 14:14.790]  I go from the cloner into a cup. Actually, I've been introduced to a new product that I really like
[14:14.790 --> 14:18.070]  It's just called a clone cup. You can order them. I check them out on Instagram
[14:18.070 --> 14:18.790]  I don't know where to order them
[14:18.790 --> 14:22.510]  They were kicked down to me as a gift for a trial a trial and I really like them
[14:22.510 --> 14:25.110]  They're harder than a normal cup. They're a little bigger than a normal cup
[14:25.510 --> 14:30.430]  They're raised a little and they've got holes where they can drain a little bit better. So the clone cup company
[14:30.430 --> 14:33.030]  I really like those if you guys are listening I could use like
[14:38.270 --> 14:43.190]  Yeah, so I go the solo cups you got to poke them yourself and they squeeze together when you try to scoop dirt into them
[14:43.190 --> 14:47.630]  These cups I'm saying a lot harder. You can wash them and reuse them. You don't have to keep going to Walmart
[14:48.630 --> 14:53.310]  Yeah, you know so I go from the cloner into that cup and then I let it get kind of
[14:53.670 --> 14:57.950]  Kind of close to root bound in that cup, but not I just want to see the thick roots on the outside
[14:57.950 --> 14:58.790]  If I picked up the dirt
[14:58.790 --> 14:59.470]  I want to see roots
[14:59.470 --> 15:04.390]  but I don't let the plant start to stretch in there and then I go to a three gallon and then sometimes if I'm doing
[15:04.390 --> 15:07.150]  Like a breeding a pheno hunt. I'll run them in three
[15:07.150 --> 15:10.830]  I'll flower them out in the three gallon when they're real short if I'm going bigger
[15:10.830 --> 15:15.750]  I'll throw them into a seven gallon and flower mountain a seven and I went the same amount of time
[15:15.750 --> 15:21.230]  I just added grow Kashi worm castings the dragonfly earth medicine root dust the black one
[15:21.230 --> 15:23.230]  I can't think of the name the bottles not over here
[15:24.710 --> 15:28.190]  Just simple stuff like that and I did a little bit of fish hydroslate and
[15:29.230 --> 15:35.510]  I've started to cut out the ogt. I'm not using ogt now. Okay, dude. My roots were huge. Yeah, super duper huge
[15:35.510 --> 15:38.110]  I could have used a bigger pot, but I don't think it was necessary
[15:38.110 --> 15:44.870]  I think I did the right amount of so they weren't root bound, but the roots were spaghetti like I just know that since we've started
[15:45.590 --> 15:48.310]  Having them in cups is almost like
[15:49.310 --> 15:54.030]  Is it is it? Okay today? Okay today? Yeah, you know, it's you're literally
[15:54.670 --> 15:57.550]  You have to be on your stuff because if you leave them
[15:58.310 --> 16:04.070]  Cuts way quick and that's I mean regular plants do but with the the worm casting it is
[16:05.190 --> 16:06.750]  So I'm gonna go out of order a little bit
[16:06.750 --> 16:11.550]  I know I said I had a bunch of news but since we're talking about all this organic stuff another thing that I've noticed
[16:11.950 --> 16:19.390]  That has really contributed to the improvement in my plants I use it in my bedroom. I use it in my flowering room
[16:19.910 --> 16:24.270]  Everything but the clones gets it the clones get it now as soon as they go into the dirt. I feed it this
[16:24.910 --> 16:27.470]  Sean gave me something called a Bokashi bucket
[16:27.950 --> 16:32.510]  the Bokashi bucket is basically a five gallon bucket with a piece of
[16:32.870 --> 16:37.670]  piece of plastic as a catch or a shelf in there then that shelf has holes in it and
[16:38.110 --> 16:42.150]  Then underneath that shelf is a spigot and the ideas that you throw
[16:42.550 --> 16:44.510]  We'll talk about more in a minute with more detail
[16:44.510 --> 16:47.510]  But you throw your shit in there and it starts to get funky and then you can
[16:47.830 --> 16:53.270]  Turn the spigot and get the shit out is why that little shelf is in there you get juice out of it juice juice nasty
[16:53.670 --> 17:00.510]  It's like a miniature compost pile juicer. Okay, so best way and set up like a Gatorade
[17:00.510 --> 17:05.550]  Great great way because I was going way I'm taking way a different way. So you take the Bokashi bucket and
[17:05.830 --> 17:11.470]  When I got mine I put the little shelf in there and it's got a little shelf that you put down some of them have
[17:11.470 --> 17:15.750]  It pre-fixed there's different models of the bucket that you get. So there's a little shelf in there with holes in it
[17:15.750 --> 17:18.910]  I put down a thin layer of newspaper just one sheet of newspaper
[17:19.350 --> 17:24.430]  So that I made more of a screen and then I put a small layer of the Bokashi down
[17:24.430 --> 17:26.350]  It comes with some powdered stuff called Bokashi
[17:26.350 --> 17:31.350]  I sprinkled about a handful of that on the screen and then what you do is you just put I put
[17:31.670 --> 17:33.430]  I'm a vegetarian and
[17:33.430 --> 17:39.910]  Every banana that I eat has a banana peel every strawberry that I eat has that little the leafy part at the end of it
[17:40.110 --> 17:42.790]  There are some strawberries that come in the package that are inedible
[17:43.310 --> 17:48.310]  Every time you I eat an onion the way I clean my onion is I chop each end off of the onion and then I can
[17:48.310 --> 17:49.870]  Get that onion skin right off of it
[17:49.870 --> 17:54.110]  And so I've got an end of each on or each end of it and the onion skin and then I clean it
[17:54.510 --> 17:59.350]  That ends and the skin go into my little bowl and then once I've got this bowl filled
[17:59.350 --> 18:04.710]  I throw all my banana peels my eggshells my onion ends my carrots
[18:04.710 --> 18:06.710]  They got funky the celery that I forgot to eat
[18:07.110 --> 18:11.950]  Coffee grounds are you have to dry them set them out and let them dry first if you're gonna do that
[18:11.950 --> 18:16.630]  But I do my yerba mate that I've cooked or that I've used and my coffee grounds
[18:16.630 --> 18:18.710]  You gotta set them on a paper towel and let them dry for like 48 hours
[18:18.710 --> 18:20.710]  You don't want to put too much moisture in there
[18:20.750 --> 18:24.750]  I could explain why but it's too much to go into anything fruit or veggie
[18:24.750 --> 18:27.750]  What else can go in there? You can put meat and dairy in there
[18:27.750 --> 18:30.790]  Can you you can put your meat and dairy products and bread in there?
[18:30.790 --> 18:34.950]  I choose not to put I don't eat any meat or dairy and I only put a little bit
[18:34.950 --> 18:39.350]  It'll be weird if your steaks got or if your plants got pork chops and steak and you didn't right?
[18:39.350 --> 18:41.670]  Yeah, yeah, and that just doesn't even happen in this house
[18:41.670 --> 18:42.910]  They're right none of that comes here
[18:42.910 --> 18:48.950]  And I just put the vegetables and the fruits and shit in there and although like some grapes and so there's apple cores and potato
[18:48.950 --> 18:49.670]  peels
[18:49.670 --> 18:52.430]  so you put they say to put a two-inch layer of
[18:52.750 --> 18:58.350]  Food waste in there and then sprinkle a handful of the bokashi and then another two-inch layer and sprinkle a handful of bokashi
[18:58.510 --> 19:00.230]  And try not to open it very often
[19:00.230 --> 19:03.030]  I throw all of my scraps into a bowl and once the bowl has
[19:03.190 --> 19:06.510]  Starts to stink up the kitchen then I put that in the bokashi bucket, right?
[19:07.390 --> 19:13.630]  Mike you've been here when I open the bucket. Yeah, I don't recommend going full work and keeping it in your kitchen like some people
[19:14.790 --> 19:19.110]  Just don't open it up to put this when you pop the lid on that sucker. It is right
[19:19.190 --> 19:25.110]  It would you can smell the magic we're fermenting banana peels apple cores
[19:26.190 --> 19:29.030]  Grapes, there are eggshells in there
[19:29.910 --> 19:35.150]  There's avocados in there like everything. I'm juice comes out of the novels. Yeah
[19:35.670 --> 19:40.230]  So you keep putting you keep packing your fruit and vegetables in there or your food waste?
[19:40.230 --> 19:42.350]  You can put your bacon and eggs in there if you want to
[19:42.630 --> 19:44.230]  All your food waste can go in there
[19:44.230 --> 19:48.070]  Then you pack it down with this little packer and keep sprinkling in the kashi and then you seal it, right?
[19:48.070 --> 19:50.350]  And then after about it took me about 10 days
[19:50.990 --> 19:55.890]  About 10 days you unscrew the spigot that's on there and I put a mason jar underneath it and this
[19:56.310 --> 20:02.630]  Juice comes out and it starts off clear and kind of pink or orange ish and it smells like oh
[20:03.230 --> 20:07.390]  It is like the bar trash can that got thrown up in and left in the Sun
[20:07.390 --> 20:09.350]  I feel like it should be a game in the podcast
[20:09.350 --> 20:11.990]  You should just have the jar sitting here and people be like, what is this?
[20:11.990 --> 20:13.990]  And you should just be like, I don't know
[20:15.590 --> 20:19.510]  The jar is sitting you can see the jar see the jar and I don't want no part of it
[20:19.510 --> 20:21.510]  I don't want to be part of this game
[20:21.830 --> 20:23.390]  The juice that comes out of there
[20:23.390 --> 20:29.870]  I throw that into a thing of clean water with a bubbler and it bubbles up real good and it makes the
[20:30.190 --> 20:35.470]  Stinkiest funky shit and I feed that to my plants and I can see them dance around. We have a lot are not
[20:36.030 --> 20:38.030]  bucket, yeah
[20:38.630 --> 20:42.470]  That was a quick hole and just slide the tube through and just that's the end of that story
[20:43.670 --> 20:51.910]  Nope, it's the plants love it people. But good God, it's right. Yeah, it is stinky. It's definitely a real delicate stomach
[20:51.910 --> 20:57.070]  Well, gosh, so it might not be for you, but it's the plants are loving it. So more details. I'll fill it up
[20:57.110 --> 21:02.470]  It's almost to the top now. I feel like I've got one more good dump of my bowl of banana peels
[21:02.470 --> 21:04.910]  I eat a lot of bananas you guys have a banana addiction
[21:04.910 --> 21:08.590]  I think they're really good for me and they give me a lot of energy and they're healthy and they're organic and I can eat
[21:08.590 --> 21:11.030]  Them in like a million ways. I've been eating the shit out of bananas
[21:11.030 --> 21:14.390]  So shout out to bananas, but I've got one more dump into there
[21:14.390 --> 21:17.590]  And then once I dump that bowl into there, I'm out of Kashi
[21:17.590 --> 21:19.390]  So I won't even be able to put more caution there
[21:19.390 --> 21:23.990]  I'll seal it and let it seal for about 14 days and everything that's in there is essentially pickling
[21:24.550 --> 21:29.350]  That's like fermenting and pickling in there and I'll pull out juice out of there. I'll get a lot of that
[21:29.350 --> 21:33.550]  I call it Kashi juice. I'll probably get five six, maybe eight to ten
[21:34.470 --> 21:38.710]  Depending on how I don't know how soggy the top layer is gonna get I'll get eight to ten jars
[21:38.790 --> 21:45.990]  hopefully of that Kashi juice out of there and then I will take two large kiddie pools of soil and
[21:46.550 --> 21:52.750]  I will put half of that Kashi bucket on the bottom of one kiddie pool and half of the Kashi bucket on another kiddie pool
[21:52.750 --> 21:58.830]  And cover that up with store bagged soil and mix that shit in and then in like 14 to 21 days
[21:58.950 --> 22:05.550]  We'll have some dank composted soil I just watched Mike eyes like immediately go pointed inwards like wait a minute
[22:05.550 --> 22:07.950]  He didn't I say I'm the one that messes with the soil
[22:09.870 --> 22:15.750]  You just wait for that bath time, okay, two kiddie pools one one with grow Kashi bro, Kashi
[22:15.950 --> 22:21.070]  Yep, and then the other with oh, it's I know it's gonna be worm castings, too
[22:21.070 --> 22:24.550]  I know the plants love it. It's where there won't be any worm castings in there just yet
[22:24.550 --> 22:28.670]  But in the future there will be castings added to that same soil. Yes indeed. Yes
[22:28.830 --> 22:33.630]  And that soil will get that'll just be the base like we'll only need a little bit of that soil
[22:33.870 --> 22:38.990]  Per the regular soil mixing bin. We'll just cut it down. Yeah, and it'll make some dank soil
[22:38.990 --> 22:42.870]  There'll be a lot of microbes in there. Yep. Yeah, Mike does not look excited
[22:46.470 --> 22:50.230]  So between the worm we're close to ruin like that day, yeah
[22:50.230 --> 22:55.070]  Yeah, yeah, just wear something you don't like between the worm castings the grow Kashi
[22:56.070 --> 23:00.030]  What else are we using fish hydroslates and the dragonfly earth medicine
[23:00.070 --> 23:04.150]  You should see the roots on my plants and the veg growth happening in my plants
[23:04.150 --> 23:07.950]  There are other things that we still have to supplement and stuff. But my roots are amazing
[23:07.950 --> 23:12.710]  I'm super impressed and I'm making my own shit. I can make with a handful of worm castings
[23:13.350 --> 23:16.350]  with one jar of that Kashi tea with
[23:17.510 --> 23:22.310]  15 scoops of grow Kashi, which sounds like a lot. It's 10 scoops of grow Kashi. There's never enough
[23:23.310 --> 23:25.510]  You really can't hurt yourself
[23:25.510 --> 23:28.110]  I mean you can but and if you want to use molasses
[23:28.110 --> 23:31.150]  It's like just like five ounces if you don't want to use molasses
[23:31.150 --> 23:31.750]  You don't need it
[23:31.750 --> 23:37.350]  But you could make I made 25 gallons of nutrients with just that right there and it was amazing
[23:37.470 --> 23:43.350]  It was totally amazing green plants green happy plants all my veg plants all my clones that got put into new pots
[23:43.350 --> 23:49.630]  They all got fed that and they look completely happy. They love life. Everything is pretty much been switched over to organic
[23:50.230 --> 23:52.430]  Yeah, so that's a good way you guys to
[23:53.470 --> 23:58.270]  Recycle all of your garden stuff. That's a good way or all your garden stuff all your waste all your food waste
[23:58.270 --> 24:01.590]  What the heck happened to my papers? They all land in the wrong order. They're backwards and it's weird
[24:01.590 --> 24:03.590]  I'm confused on do anymore
[24:03.750 --> 24:07.310]  So it's fit around I'm gonna try to fix it without anybody noticing, right?
[24:07.310 --> 24:11.070]  So just take your food scraps and throw it in there and you can make your own nutrients guys
[24:11.070 --> 24:15.870]  We can save the world one one drink at a time one food at a time one. Yeah
[24:16.270 --> 24:18.270]  I've seen three people put
[24:19.110 --> 24:21.110]  Paper towels and
[24:21.550 --> 24:25.150]  Kleenex and stuff in there too because the it's paper. It'll biodegrade in there
[24:25.150 --> 24:28.790]  I know you looked at me like that's disgusting, but I mean it's rotten banana
[24:31.270 --> 24:38.590]  Yeah, it's gross but it's not is I'm not looking forward to smelling the industrial size one
[24:40.350 --> 24:45.510]  There's a video it's not the I was looking for the grokashi website I couldn't find there's there's another guy that does it in
[24:45.910 --> 24:48.510]  55 gallon drums and he was farms
[24:49.510 --> 24:54.390]  Sitting there picture in a row of 55 gallon drums in the big side bowl size
[24:55.070 --> 24:59.830]  But that's what you don't smell is put dumping it into five gallon buckets and missing a portion of each one
[25:00.110 --> 25:03.030]  Yeah, all over his feet. No, you don't smell it at that point
[25:04.950 --> 25:10.270]  What's that town to the east of here, you know what the town I'm talking about where it's just cows like crammed into fences
[25:10.910 --> 25:13.950]  They sell them there something. I don't know it was horrible. You could taste
[25:14.470 --> 25:17.350]  Cow yummy, that's kind of how Greeley smells
[25:17.750 --> 25:22.150]  No, really is kind of kind of cow poopy. All right, so I received an email
[25:22.150 --> 25:25.430]  Let me where the heck here is my phone. I have to find this email
[25:26.950 --> 25:32.510]  This is the ladybug email I want to talk about I learned a little bit about emails. I'm searching for this message
[25:32.910 --> 25:34.910]  Here it is
[25:38.670 --> 25:42.430]  Well, that's right, I'm multitasking don't laugh at me or do shit
[25:42.830 --> 25:49.670]  You know yesterday bro, I got hit in the head so hard that I don't remember half of my evening and I'm not even joking
[25:50.990 --> 25:53.950]  We were at a friend's house. Who did you deserve it? No, it was an accident
[25:54.150 --> 25:56.670]  There's I did it to myself. So it's even funnier
[25:56.670 --> 26:01.590]  There are two stairs that dip down into this other part of these people's house and right above the stairs
[26:01.590 --> 26:08.470]  There's a like a fuck. There's a beam a head thing like a fucking what is like a face smasher the head smasher
[26:08.590 --> 26:15.230]  Yeah, dude, there's like a decorative awning thing there and the architect was like all people I don't I don't remember hitting it
[26:15.230 --> 26:16.310]  I did not feel it
[26:16.310 --> 26:21.270]  All I remember is getting up off the ground and Sean looking to me going dude. Are you okay? I think so
[26:27.750 --> 26:29.110]  I was going to pick up a chair
[26:29.110 --> 26:33.070]  So I went and got the chair and took it to where I was getting and when I set it down I felt drunk
[26:33.070 --> 26:35.070]  I was like I am fucked up right now
[26:35.070 --> 26:39.390]  Everything was gray and Smith's is like you want a dad a little bit. I was like a big one, dude
[26:39.390 --> 26:41.190]  I felt weird all night
[26:41.190 --> 26:45.390]  I had someone come hang out with me last night and they were like you're like loopy and I was like I told you I
[26:45.390 --> 26:47.390]  Got hit in the head hard
[26:47.390 --> 26:49.390]  It was so crazy
[26:50.030 --> 26:54.190]  Look face man. I'm like, I don't even I didn't feel it
[26:54.190 --> 26:58.150]  I didn't feel it didn't hurt until like when I sat down later cuz I got hit so hard
[26:58.150 --> 27:03.150]  I just went out my body was like sleepy like I was on the floor at Spence's house just laying there
[27:05.790 --> 27:08.790]  Was good dude, it was pretty good happens a lot in this town
[27:08.790 --> 27:13.270]  There's a lot of short everybody was pretty worried about me. Look on their faces, dude
[27:13.270 --> 27:17.270]  It was loud like they all stood up and shit. Like what the fuck was that? It was good
[27:17.270 --> 27:21.790]  What the hell was I gonna talk about ladybugs? I'm way distracted. Yes, suddenly. I feel like I had a head injury again
[27:22.390 --> 27:24.430]  So this dude, he asked me not to say his name
[27:24.510 --> 27:29.790]  There's parts of this email that I won't read cuz some of it was just for me, but he opens with first of all
[27:29.830 --> 27:34.630]  Thanks for the awesome pod love your style and mystic roots were a perfect fit for bed music
[27:34.630 --> 27:39.730]  You're welcome to read this on the pod, but please don't mention my real name. Just use vape dad on reddit
[27:40.150 --> 27:44.630]  Very active in our slash trees and then he talks about his soil where he is
[27:44.710 --> 27:50.810]  And then he says I was reading a book called cannabis cultivation the other day at Barnes & Noble and they recommended putting ladybugs
[27:51.190 --> 27:55.270]  In our greenhouse to fight aphids and caterpillars and a whole assortment of pests
[27:55.310 --> 28:02.550]  So I'm researching organic growing for no other reason than I like the all-natural aspect of it thinking thinking like this
[28:02.550 --> 28:06.790]  I was wondering would it be a good idea to raise loose ladybugs in your grow room?
[28:06.790 --> 28:10.670]  What could they hurt in the stages of growth if anything or could these be?
[28:10.990 --> 28:15.470]  Nature's pest control for those aspiring to care give this may be a dumb question
[28:15.470 --> 28:21.570]  But I just wanted to ask a live person with some real quantifiable growing experience again. Thanks for the pot and keep it up
[28:21.570 --> 28:25.170]  It's a really beautiful thing you're doing by the way
[28:25.170 --> 28:30.330]  I hope you get invited to the Joe Rogan experience pod one day, but I know your plants would miss you
[28:30.370 --> 28:33.650]  Thanks for all the great free grow info much love
[28:34.010 --> 28:40.850]  Vape dad guys. I say his real name that email at all. I don't know. Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I did not
[28:41.410 --> 28:45.710]  I'm pretty high, but I don't think you did either. I don't think so so many cool things, dude
[28:45.710 --> 28:49.770]  You're welcome for all the free grow info. I am proud and happy to do that. My goal is to
[28:50.690 --> 28:54.650]  Quit growing all the mids start fucking eliminating all the no melt, Nebraska
[28:56.410 --> 29:00.410]  Everybody needs to be growing high quality cannabis and all I have to do is talk into a microphone
[29:00.410 --> 29:02.930]  So I'm really excited to do that. You're very welcome
[29:04.050 --> 29:09.510]  Joe Rogan experience podcast dude, if I got there, I don't know what I would do. I'd be super stoked to do it
[29:09.510 --> 29:11.510]  Just sit there and grin into the microphone
[29:12.090 --> 29:18.130]  Probably what I would do. I'd love to be on that show with Ari and Joey Diaz and Joe Rogan
[29:19.130 --> 29:21.450]  I'd be the hate the hate
[29:23.930 --> 29:24.970]  Man
[29:24.970 --> 29:27.130]  Fuck you haters, but I'd love to be on that
[29:27.970 --> 29:32.810]  So let's get to the point here and dude you said this may be a dumb question. No dumb questions, bro
[29:32.810 --> 29:35.330]  Never no dumb question. You gotta start somewhere
[29:35.330 --> 29:40.490]  I had training wheels at one point and now I'm doing wheelies and you just got to start somewhere. There are no dumb questions
[29:41.610 --> 29:45.930]  My theory on ladybugs and Michael probably back me up on this a long time ago
[29:45.930 --> 29:49.650]  I did what I thought was cute and I went to the hydro store and I bought a thousand lady bugs
[29:49.730 --> 29:50.230]  Yeah
[29:50.230 --> 29:55.250]  I've been thinking about your experiment while you were reading the email opened up the container and let them fly about the grow room and
[29:55.330 --> 30:00.810]  They were cute. I got out the camera and took pictures of ladybugs fucking on my plants and it was really cool
[30:00.810 --> 30:04.650]  Yep, didn't it see Adams? Yep, then there they sell 300
[30:05.970 --> 30:08.050]  And then the next day released. What was it?
[30:08.450 --> 30:10.450]  1,500
[30:11.050 --> 30:15.450]  Envelope the t-shirt from Amazon shows up. Yeah, he just opened that fucker and dumps
[30:16.290 --> 30:20.370]  If I if I released 1500 of them the next morning there were 50 alive in that bitch
[30:20.810 --> 30:25.970]  They fly into all your fans. They fly up into your lights. So here's something that Sean taught me
[30:26.530 --> 30:31.390]  Credit to Sean King Cola. He taught me this and I'm gonna butcher it because I had a head injury that night
[30:32.930 --> 30:37.590]  Lady bugs don't see in the same spectrum as humans lady bugs
[30:37.590 --> 30:40.310]  See a UV spectrum that's only provided by the light
[30:40.310 --> 30:43.310]  So when we take a ladybug and we put it in a grow room
[30:43.310 --> 30:46.550]  All it sees is a grow light and it all it doesn't see it
[30:46.550 --> 30:52.070]  It it's confused now and it wants to get toward the light that it can see and it's warm and the warmth and so it flies
[30:52.070 --> 30:57.550]  Into your hoods it flies into your fans and you get to sweep them all up and they smell terrible. Yeah
[30:59.190 --> 31:06.390]  Months cleaning ladybugs out of every little corner and looking cranny in that fucking grow and then you'd find them in weird places
[31:06.670 --> 31:08.910]  Randomly too and they didn't do much
[31:09.670 --> 31:12.030]  There are predatory mites that are worth it
[31:12.670 --> 31:17.550]  That work indoors, but I don't think that ladybugs praying mantis are cool indoors
[31:17.550 --> 31:23.090]  They don't run away and ladybugs are also hard to find gratory creatures. They want to take off. They don't want to be there
[31:23.090 --> 31:27.230]  They want to fly away and then they want to eat and they want to fly away. Yeah, so
[31:27.790 --> 31:29.430]  In my honest opinion
[31:29.430 --> 31:34.510]  I would say no on the ladybugs in an indoor situation if you have a greenhouse or an outdoor situation
[31:34.790 --> 31:39.030]  And you're ready to keep you're gonna have to keep adding to them and you're also gonna have to feed them
[31:39.350 --> 31:45.910]  They do require food. Even if there are aphids and shit there like you don't want to eat hummus and falafel all day
[31:45.910 --> 31:48.070]  You need to change so you got to provide them some kind of food
[31:48.350 --> 31:51.910]  So keep that in mind if you're gonna use them in an outdoor or a greenhouse situation
[31:51.910 --> 31:56.870]  But indoors I would not do the ladybugs and then that food could also bring other pests
[31:56.910 --> 32:01.710]  That's very likely very likely at this point. I tell people to release them around there
[32:01.990 --> 32:06.950]  Their grow not in their grow room at this point so they sprinkle them in the front and backyard
[32:07.710 --> 32:09.110]  It don't bother with them
[32:09.110 --> 32:12.950]  Otherwise just as like an extra preventative measure and the thing about the mantises
[32:12.950 --> 32:18.950]  I've been in a few pet stores here in Colorado and like you guys carry mantis and I'm expecting to like see a whole
[32:19.550 --> 32:22.670]  You know fish tank full of mantises and like yeah, I'll take 30 of them
[32:23.590 --> 32:27.910]  It's it's I know you got there. You got to order them and they'll send you eggs and then you gotta let the eggs hatch
[32:28.670 --> 32:36.330]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's a website I think I'll have to buy a calm a RB ICO calm go there are Bico organics
[32:36.750 --> 32:40.110]  They've got all kinds of great shit. They'll send you bugs. They'll send you nematodes
[32:40.670 --> 32:45.870]  Some of it is seasonal so you might not be able to get everything but organic pest control at its finest
[32:45.870 --> 32:49.230]  They don't pay me to say that I just like sharing useful shit with people
[32:49.910 --> 32:51.390]  We've been going 32 minutes
[32:51.390 --> 32:55.870]  I'd like to go about 45 maybe an hour at the most and I also want to read some news articles
[32:55.870 --> 32:59.310]  So you guys want to get into the news? I do but we can make
[33:01.470 --> 33:06.550]  Dad though you thinking so I kind of agree with you. I like the way Mike thinks Mike is on it
[33:06.550 --> 33:13.190]  I'm gonna take a drink here. We're gonna dab some lemonade from turpex. I think was it John John that recommended this to us?
[33:13.750 --> 33:15.750]  Alright, I'm gonna somebody talk for a second
[33:16.430 --> 33:20.630]  When I was down there, he didn't he had not had a sample of the review yet
[33:20.630 --> 33:22.750]  So he couldn't really give me an honest opinion
[33:22.750 --> 33:29.070]  But the name was enticing but names can be misleading sometimes. Yes. We all know about the name game
[33:29.910 --> 33:31.750]  yeah, so
[33:31.750 --> 33:38.990]  It was interesting hearing about where the the handkerchief came from and that was that was I'm a gamer. I'm Mike's a gamer
[33:38.990 --> 33:41.310]  That was a pretty fucking funny story because I didn't get it
[33:41.310 --> 33:47.310]  I'm not really a big Uncharted fan, but that was fucking hilarious like John John. You're the man dude. Thanks for being on the podcast
[33:47.310 --> 33:51.030]  I'm gonna go back up. I want to go to the turpy mansion the turpy boy trap house
[33:51.070 --> 33:57.110]  Shoot kind of on a semi frequent basis and do a podcast up there. So John John you need to be there again at the
[33:57.110 --> 33:58.630]  Next episode. We'll give you your own mic
[33:58.630 --> 34:02.630]  I had one Mike that was being passed around because there were a lot of people there dude
[34:02.630 --> 34:05.830]  There were and you hear people would come in and out. Yeah, one guy would come in here
[34:05.830 --> 34:08.190]  Hey, my name is Bill and I just want to say dabs on dabs
[34:08.190 --> 34:11.550]  And he would leave and like Larry would come in and I didn't know half the people
[34:11.550 --> 34:17.070]  They just wanted to get in on shit. So that go ahead Mike. Oh, no, I was just I've loved that episode
[34:17.190 --> 34:21.670]  You do a lot of cool shit, but most of the time, you know, I give a fuck about wanting to go with that
[34:21.670 --> 34:27.270]  I listen to that episode was like damn. Why was my there? Yeah. Yeah. No, I haven't taken anybody to that
[34:28.030 --> 34:30.030]  In the trunk next time you go
[34:30.350 --> 34:31.590]  spots, you know when you got
[34:31.590 --> 34:36.990]  Sneak away friends you guys are dabbing and everyone in the house freaks out because there's weird white guy in the front yard
[34:36.990 --> 34:38.990]  Just staring at the house. That's just me
[34:38.990 --> 34:41.390]  You can come next time and you could be the producer there it is
[34:41.390 --> 34:46.830]  I'll teach you how to hook up all the gear and title producer. Yeah, this is my producer. Mm-hmm
[34:47.150 --> 34:50.190]  That's much. That's a I would I would stick producer. Yeah
[34:51.230 --> 34:56.970]  Producer sounds good. That's like official bro. Yeah, you could have a suit and a tie and no one would give you any shit
[34:56.970 --> 34:59.130]  Who's he that's my lawyer? Yeah
[35:03.270 --> 35:08.230]  Alright I'm gonna take my first dab of this lemonade from turpex big shout out to turpex
[35:08.230 --> 35:10.230]  Well, I should taste it. Huh? Cuz what if it's terrible?
[35:12.870 --> 35:15.830]  Jordan you're on the you're on the money. Yeah, here you go. You're on the line
[35:16.070 --> 35:22.150]  I've uh, I watched a couple of their the the guys that were on the podcast the old world videos that they did on YouTube
[35:22.150 --> 35:25.910]  And stuff they used to be on it all the time and I guess they got busy
[35:25.910 --> 35:30.950]  I mean you could obviously tell it's picked up business has picked up from back in the day and they all got
[35:31.510 --> 35:35.630]  I'm seeing these fucking dishes everywhere, dude. I bet those boys are busy as shit. Yeah. Yeah
[35:36.350 --> 35:41.410]  Are these black turpex containers? Yeah, they're popular. Yeah, when you pull out one of these people know what you got. Yeah
[35:42.870 --> 35:44.870]  Tasty definitely tasty
[35:45.830 --> 35:47.830]  lemon candy with
[35:48.790 --> 35:53.030]  It's another flavor that I can't yet describe it'll hit me in a minute, but it's definitely a sativa high
[35:54.230 --> 35:57.270]  Cuz my head is going and it made my eyes wobbly
[35:57.830 --> 36:01.810]  Which is something that only a couple of other strains have ever done to me. I believe I'd sativa hit
[36:01.810 --> 36:06.750]  All right. Here we go. Damn. How big whoa. That was weird. It still sounds weird. Is that one of us?
[36:09.150 --> 36:11.150]  There we go, oh my bad
[36:11.670 --> 36:17.910]  The email cord, sorry guys, that's what happens when the email cord touches the microphone or the headphone jack if you guys heard it at all
[36:17.910 --> 36:21.990]  Oh, they did we sounded like robots for a minute there. I'll try to fix it. I'll fix it in post
[36:23.030 --> 36:28.710]  I put half of it to my nose. It definitely has the high limit terpene there. Yeah some candy
[36:29.430 --> 36:33.990]  So the name is worthy the candy. Yeah, the name is worthy. That's definitely some lemonade
[36:33.990 --> 36:35.990]  I
[36:36.670 --> 36:40.750]  Just gotta go back for a little mini flavor. Yeah, it looks like a wine
[36:52.950 --> 36:59.870]  Do that was pretty smooth you just worked the email cord the mic cable the eat the carb cap a little bit of multitasking
[37:00.870 --> 37:03.710]  Handle this month fucking lungs. Hmm. Yeah
[37:04.750 --> 37:09.470]  We all just took the same size dabs. I took a bigger dad than that and didn't choke tobacco
[37:10.230 --> 37:13.210]  Tobacco's fault say no to cigarettes my friends say no to cigarettes
[37:21.110 --> 37:25.490]  All right, let's do some news we're at 37 minutes let's just do a couple of these news articles
[37:25.490 --> 37:27.730]  We'll save a couple for maybe Wednesday or something
[37:28.730 --> 37:34.090]  Well, this one caught my attention I actually want to give a big shout out to one of my Facebook friends Mike Howley
[37:34.890 --> 37:39.930]  We used to call him bike alley. It could be Michael Howley, but he's from Boston. He's a masshole
[37:40.010 --> 37:45.170]  He's a cool-ass dude to tell you the truth. He knows what's up with cannabis. He's educated. He's smart
[37:45.170 --> 37:47.210]  He can separate the bullshit from the truth
[37:48.530 --> 37:52.250]  He should be more known in our cannabis community and I want to give him a shout out right now
[37:52.250 --> 37:56.050]  He probably doesn't listen to this show in any way, but huge shout out to Mike by Callie
[37:56.330 --> 38:00.930]  You do a good job, right? I appreciate all your Facebook posts. I see how much you try to help and
[38:01.650 --> 38:04.690]  Participate with our community and I fucking appreciate it. So shout out
[38:05.370 --> 38:11.730]  That's where I found out about this story, but it says pot pesticide contamination in Denver grows. The article is by William breathes and
[38:12.250 --> 38:15.010]  It says I'm gonna choke here in a second because I took a huge dab
[38:15.010 --> 38:21.330]  But just bear with me six marijuana grows in Denver were ordered to quarantine and possibly destroy plant harvests after Denver Fire Department
[38:21.650 --> 38:24.890]  Officials determined that the grow facilities weren't using chemicals properly
[38:26.050 --> 38:28.050]  I
[38:30.090 --> 38:33.330]  Tried to are not to laugh in the heart or I tried not to the worst it was
[38:33.650 --> 38:40.410]  Mike just moved away from the microphone to sneeze but head butted the mic stand with his sneeze. That was fucking glorious
[38:40.930 --> 38:45.270]  Just a little head, but I wish there was video for that. All right, so
[38:46.010 --> 38:49.730]  They're not using chemicals properly bugs and pests were a fact of life for commercial growers
[38:49.730 --> 38:54.170]  But dealing with them appropriately is important because eventually humans will consume the pot
[38:54.650 --> 38:59.970]  Earlier this month the city of Denver released a bulletin warning grows or warning grows about the improper use of pesticides
[39:00.290 --> 39:07.610]  Because the fire department's recent discovery the city has ordered all licensed pot grows in the city to send in pesticide reports by April 1st
[39:08.330 --> 39:15.130]  pesticides and agricultural chemicals must be used in accordance with the product label and with all applicable federal state and local laws and
[39:15.770 --> 39:20.970]  Regulations improper use of pesticides on marijuana can raise serious public health concerns the bulletin reads
[39:21.410 --> 39:28.850]  The catch is that the federal agency in charge of regulating pesticide use the Environmental Protection Agency doesn't have acceptable levels for use on cannabis
[39:29.210 --> 39:31.210]  Since cannabis is illegal on a federal level
[39:31.650 --> 39:38.730]  The Colorado Department of Agriculture lacks official guidelines to beyond suggesting that growers not use any pesticides that haven't been specifically
[39:39.170 --> 39:43.050]  Tested labeled and assigned a set tolerance for pot growing now
[39:43.810 --> 39:49.250]  Anybody that's listened to this podcast for more than three or four episodes already knows what my solution to a part of this problem is
[39:49.770 --> 39:55.090]  Environmental Protection Agency does not have acceptable levels for use on cannabis since cannabis is illegal on on a federal level
[39:55.530 --> 39:58.090]  Let's think about this a solution anybody
[39:59.250 --> 40:07.530]  Legalize cannabis. Yes. See that's your first step that will make this a little bit easier it was legalization comes product safety people
[40:08.530 --> 40:09.610]  All right
[40:09.610 --> 40:15.810]  Where was I the CDA does have an unofficial list of pesticides that can be used on unspecified crops that are intended for human consumption
[40:15.810 --> 40:17.010]  however
[40:17.450 --> 40:23.210]  I kind of read that weird my fault and the state marijuana enforcement division has a strict list of allowed pesticides as well as
[40:23.370 --> 40:31.170]  Instructions for how grow owners have to store and dispose of them state law also requires that shops write up standard operating operating procedures for all
[40:31.250 --> 40:38.490]  pesticide applications in Denver dispensaries will now be required to submit a list of every pesticide used and how much of it is
[40:38.850 --> 40:43.370]  Used copies of those records must be kept in the facility where the marijuana is grown
[40:43.810 --> 40:49.650]  Additionally grows must send lists of pesticides and information on their safety to the Denver Fire Department and a
[40:50.210 --> 40:54.730]  Sign must be placed on the door of every grow room listing any and all pesticides used
[40:54.970 --> 40:59.890]  those businesses that don't comply could face fine could face fines and closures and
[41:00.330 --> 41:06.690]  Let me tell you I work with the dispensary and I'm there on a daily bay on a semi daily basis the past couple of weeks
[41:07.210 --> 41:12.210]  Dude, they are not joking when they say they're gonna find you or close you they will come in that day
[41:12.210 --> 41:13.970]  They will find the violation that day
[41:13.970 --> 41:20.090]  They will write a ten thousand dollar fine and they will close your shop down right on the spot everybody that's here leave you're closed
[41:20.090 --> 41:26.130]  I've seen it happen not at the spot that I represent, but I've seen it happen to another place people don't get the
[41:26.730 --> 41:32.090]  The amount of regulation and oversight that this industry operates under yeah, I mean D is massive
[41:32.090 --> 41:34.450]  Yeah, when I'm hanging out near the bud room
[41:34.530 --> 41:35.890]  I'll hear people
[41:35.890 --> 41:40.370]  It's been a long time since anyone said it but you'll hear people or people that don't have an ID that want to get in
[41:40.370 --> 41:45.530]  Can you just let me in just once it's like dude. This is a billion dollar operation
[41:45.530 --> 41:48.250]  I don't know exactly but I mean it's fucking more money than you could even
[41:48.370 --> 41:53.930]  Imagine we're gonna risk all of our business for one dude to sneak through without his ID every operation in town
[41:53.930 --> 41:57.230]  You can call a million dollar business. Yeah, it's all on camera
[41:57.230 --> 42:01.570]  Oh, I saw the price list for just some of the grow equipment that I ordered the other day
[42:01.570 --> 42:04.310]  I was like, yeah, we need like 30 of these and they're like
[42:04.890 --> 42:06.890]  That's this much and I was like
[42:07.250 --> 42:09.930]  Order it but oh my god, right. That's a house
[42:10.370 --> 42:12.370]  We just spent a house on fans
[42:12.730 --> 42:15.850]  What the hell? Okay, I want to get more into this article
[42:15.850 --> 42:23.370]  It says the city also says that the Denver Department of Public Health and Environment will be inspecting cultivation sites as well as infused product
[42:23.890 --> 42:27.490]  Manufacturing sites. So what was happening you guys you heard the article
[42:27.610 --> 42:34.270]  there were some shops in Denver some grows in Denver that were using chemicals that should not have been being used on the
[42:34.830 --> 42:39.990]  Cannabis that they were selling to the public and it's my bet that the shops that were busting out those
[42:40.550 --> 42:43.910]  $75 and $99 ounces. It's probably those guys
[42:44.590 --> 42:47.670]  Probably they're just selling coupons on the foot. Yeah
[42:48.230 --> 42:52.230]  The ones that you see in the back of the magazines and stuff. Yeah, those are man
[42:52.230 --> 42:56.790]  That's terrible that they're doing that and there's a pit the picture of this article makes it the best
[42:57.510 --> 43:01.750]  There is a picture of a guy and like a breaking bad suit with the full-on gas mask
[43:02.710 --> 43:10.790]  Toting weed out. He's pouring a bottle of Monsanto chemicals into another container and it's completely unrelated to anything to do with the article
[43:10.790 --> 43:15.550]  It's just a fear and I picture is all it is. I'll turn the computer this way. You got to lean this way
[43:15.550 --> 43:19.190]  I've got too many things plugged in but look at this shit here full-on breaking bad suit
[43:19.590 --> 43:25.790]  Chemical into chemical nothing to do with cannabis or this article. It looks like glue. It looks like he's pouring glue
[43:25.790 --> 43:31.430]  Well Eagle 20 looks like that if you've ever seen Eagle 20 and I kind of assumed we talked about it friends and I Eagle 20
[43:31.430 --> 43:37.230]  It was probably one of the products being used in all of this bullshit if I read it, right the shops that have their crops
[43:38.150 --> 43:39.310]  quarantined
[43:39.310 --> 43:44.110]  Right now turn themselves in essentially like they handed in their form that was due April 1
[43:44.110 --> 43:49.070]  Oh, wow, and when they started looking on there like hey wait, that's on the whatever the list
[43:49.750 --> 43:52.390]  See, I've been read that part. This is the only article I've seen about it
[43:52.470 --> 43:57.870]  There was another big change with hash the other day where they're like rescheduling it or something like that, too
[43:57.870 --> 43:59.950]  Wasn't there do you got this article? No, I do not
[44:00.950 --> 44:05.910]  I'm sorry. We'll look for that one on another episode wasn't even a smart ass to you. Sorry
[44:07.670 --> 44:09.670]  Did you hear about this one thing that I'm not
[44:11.950 --> 44:15.190]  This is our course not even a news correspondent Adam gasp shows up
[44:17.070 --> 44:19.070]  High shit and unprepared good to see you
[44:20.270 --> 44:22.270]  actually on Instagram
[44:23.350 --> 44:26.510]  But I'm not even gonna be able to find it so this article is super long
[44:26.550 --> 44:30.670]  Much time I've got I might skip this one and we might give you guys a Wednesday episode. I've got us
[44:32.150 --> 44:37.130]  How far we go we're 45 minutes and we're not gonna do this super long article we're gonna save that this one
[44:37.130 --> 44:42.590]  I'm excited about what you guys are gonna be like, what is it more lube more lube?
[44:42.590 --> 44:48.350]  No, no, if you guys want to he's referring to the Floria episode you guys this is not a weird bromance going on here
[44:48.350 --> 44:53.790]  All right. So I scroll down to the cannabis and this article is by David McFadden of the Associated Press
[44:54.790 --> 44:56.790]  There's a picture of
[44:57.510 --> 44:59.150]  bunny whaler
[44:59.150 --> 45:00.870]  lighting up a
[45:00.870 --> 45:04.310]  Big old bowl in front of a picture of King Haile Selassie
[45:04.310 --> 45:09.590]  I and then to the right of him is King Haile Selassie. I and the Queen sitting right next to him
[45:10.710 --> 45:18.310]  Great shot. So I'll get into it. I'll get to the point historic new gondolas in Jamaica for Rastafari religious use comma MMJ program
[45:18.950 --> 45:20.790]  So
[45:20.790 --> 45:25.670]  Kingston Jamaica marijuana has been pervasive but illegal in Jamaica for decades
[45:25.870 --> 45:31.590]  Consumed as a medicinal herb puffed as a sacrament by Rastafarians and sung about in the islands famed reggae music
[45:31.990 --> 45:36.230]  after many years of dialogue about the culturally entrenched drug and embot em
[45:36.630 --> 45:42.310]  Boldened what and emboldened by changes to drug laws in US states Jamaica's Parliament on Tuesday
[45:42.790 --> 45:44.790]  Tuesday night gave final approval to enact
[45:45.270 --> 45:52.070]  Decriminalizing small amounts of pot and establishing a licensing agency to regulate a lawful medical marijuana industry
[45:52.950 --> 45:55.470]  Yes, we got medical marijuana in Jamaica
[45:56.030 --> 45:57.070]  Welcome to the club
[45:57.070 --> 46:03.990]  the historic amendments paved the way for a cannabis licensing authority to be established to deal with regulating and cultivating and distributing or
[46:04.510 --> 46:11.430]  Distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes both houses of Jamaica's legislature have approved this legislation
[46:12.150 --> 46:14.150]  Well, it's so funny, bro
[46:15.350 --> 46:17.350]  Awesome story that Mountain Dew was a
[46:18.870 --> 46:24.230]  Power to it he held that far from the mics and it was still like a shotgun in my ears. That was good
[46:24.230 --> 46:27.110]  I know people from the South to be like that's a good can of Mountain Dew
[46:27.870 --> 46:32.630]  When a beer opens like that, it's a good can of beer. It's gonna be a good can of beer right here
[46:32.630 --> 46:38.070]  That's one of them special Mountain Dews. I don't think I've drink a Mountain Dew. Yeah, see it's been over a year since I've had
[46:38.070 --> 46:41.830]  Mountain Dew I think yeah, that's probably since I was 16. That was like getting off crack
[46:41.990 --> 46:44.070]  My body went through a withdrawal for a minute there
[46:44.070 --> 46:48.310]  I've got the regular do and the foe do at home just in case I run out of the regular
[46:48.990 --> 46:51.430]  Yeah, he does make his own. He's got the little fizz machine
[46:51.910 --> 46:53.990]  So in a victory for religious freedom
[46:54.510 --> 47:01.750]  Adherence to the homegrown Rastafari spiritual movement can now freely use marijuana for sacramental purposes for the first time on the tropical land
[47:01.830 --> 47:03.830]  Yes, I Rastafari
[47:03.870 --> 47:09.910]  The law makes possession of up to two ounces of marijuana a petty offense that could result in a ticket but not a criminal record
[47:10.430 --> 47:12.870]  Cultivation of South League or white mic
[47:16.990 --> 47:23.230]  I like that. Well, they've got medical marijuana now and dude before if you got caught with cannabis in Jamaica, no for sure
[47:23.230 --> 47:26.870]  It was seven days in a Jamaican jail and seven days in a Jamaican jail
[47:26.870 --> 47:30.430]  I'd probably rather take 45 days in a Pueblo jail to tell you the truth
[47:30.670 --> 47:35.870]  Like it's not gonna be anything fun. You sleep on the cement floor with the rats and you don't get no food
[47:35.870 --> 47:38.030]  So yeah, what else is new?
[47:40.150 --> 47:44.110]  So what's two ounces petty offense you don't go to jail that's way better
[47:45.190 --> 47:48.630]  Five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted
[47:49.430 --> 47:51.430]  five ganja plants now
[47:51.630 --> 47:55.790]  Tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad will soon be able to apply for permits
[47:55.870 --> 48:02.790]  Authorizing them to legally buy small amounts of Jamaican weed or ganja as it is known locally. That's fucking brilliant
[48:03.750 --> 48:09.870]  On behalf of the government to say 15 bucks so that you can fill your prescription while you're I don't
[48:09.870 --> 48:13.230]  Oh god, why don't I say I don't have to bring it with me on the boat?
[48:13.230 --> 48:17.430]  But yeah, I can buy it while I'm there. Yep, not bring it back on your boat, you know
[48:17.790 --> 48:21.150]  But that's gonna be reggae cruise. That's all I'm gonna say
[48:21.670 --> 48:26.230]  Cruise, I don't know if anybody saw my Instagram and Facebook post about reggae cruise, but in November, I think
[48:27.110 --> 48:30.910]  There's the biggest cruise with like 20 of my favorite reggae artists
[48:31.390 --> 48:33.990]  And they're going to Jamaica and I
[48:34.710 --> 48:36.550]  It's gonna be even more fun now
[48:36.550 --> 48:37.050]  Okay
[48:37.050 --> 48:37.590]  on Wednesday
[48:37.590 --> 48:44.270]  Colorado based United Cannabis Corp said it has launched a partnership with Jamaican agencies to launch a marijuana research and development
[48:44.790 --> 48:50.110]  Development facility on the island that they hope will lead patents and medical cannabis products
[48:50.950 --> 48:57.750]  Peter Bunting the islands national security minister said the legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on
[48:58.390 --> 49:01.270]  Transnational drug trafficking or a cultivation of illegal plots
[49:01.670 --> 49:06.910]  Jamaica has long been considered the Caribbean's largest supplier of pot to the US and regional islands
[49:07.030 --> 49:10.590]  The passage of this legislation does not create a free-for-all in the growing
[49:11.150 --> 49:13.150]  transporting dealing or exporting of ganja
[49:13.670 --> 49:16.070]  Security forces will continue to rigorously enforce
[49:16.590 --> 49:20.430]  Jamaican law with our international treaty obligations Bunting said in Parliament
[49:20.990 --> 49:27.510]  William Brownfield the US assistant secretary for counter narcotics affairs. Damn. I'm glad that's not my job
[49:27.510 --> 49:31.430]  That'd be a lot of work. I am William Brownfield the US assistant secretary
[49:32.430 --> 49:34.430]  narcotics affairs
[49:35.710 --> 49:37.230]  Genetics yeah
[49:37.230 --> 49:41.070]  Yeah, so this dude told the Associated Press days before the vote that Jamaican laws
[49:41.070 --> 49:44.870]  Of course to make his own business and Jamaica's and Jamaica's sovereign decision
[49:44.990 --> 49:49.070]  But he noted that the trafficking of marijuana into the US remains against the law
[49:49.310 --> 49:53.670]  We expect the Jamaica and all states party to the UN drug conventions will uphold their obligations
[49:54.110 --> 50:01.270]  Including a firm commitment to combating and dismantling criminal organizations involved in drug drug trafficking. He told AP in an email
[50:02.670 --> 50:06.150]  Once again you guys how do we stop illegal cannabis trafficking?
[50:09.510 --> 50:12.530]  It's the only answer that makes any sense
[50:12.530 --> 50:15.430]  That's the truth what we need to do is buy a small plane at first
[50:15.790 --> 50:21.350]  And then we can we fly people straight from Colorado to Jamaica for a trip
[50:22.350 --> 50:24.350]  Stop somewhere
[50:24.630 --> 50:28.830]  The smaller the plane the more frequently I'm telling you now if it's gonna be
[50:31.230 --> 50:36.990]  I'm just gonna keep reading before Adam crashes a plane in a fantasy. Yep. Just saying anybody's got the money
[50:37.630 --> 50:41.110]  from Colorado Jamaica why there's a weed legal in both
[50:42.270 --> 50:46.910]  So anyway debate debate has long raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja
[50:46.910 --> 50:53.110]  But previous calls to do criminalize small amounts of marijuana fizzled out because officials feared it would bring sanctions from Washington
[50:54.030 --> 50:57.350]  Jamaican officials now have high hopes that the island can become a player in the
[50:57.990 --> 51:03.350]  Nascent medical marijuana industry health tourism and the development of innovative pot derived items
[51:03.770 --> 51:08.510]  Local scientists already have a history of creating marijuana derived products such as canisol
[51:08.510 --> 51:14.790]  Which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glucoma patients. I like that how they say local scientists in Jamaica
[51:15.030 --> 51:18.470]  You know some do with dreadlocks in a five gallon bucket making bubble hash
[51:21.630 --> 51:26.870]  I've seen quite a few people that are moving down that way as well a lot of popular people
[51:26.870 --> 51:31.070]  Yeah, I know you have to a lot of our friends went on a trip there just recently. Oh, really?
[51:31.070 --> 51:32.110]  Yeah, a lot of our friend
[51:32.110 --> 51:33.070]  Well, there's a couple months back
[51:33.070 --> 51:36.990]  But as soon as this happened when it was like coming up they went there and helped him put this shit in place
[51:36.990 --> 51:42.990]  Nice some of the people to use like Addy way. Okay, so that as in Addison tomorrow. What's up, brother?
[51:43.870 --> 51:46.970]  From up there in Denver River Rock area and stuff like that
[51:47.590 --> 51:49.590]  All right. I'm gonna keep reading. So, uh
[51:49.990 --> 51:56.870]  Where were I Commerce Minister Anthony Hylton said the cannabis industry holds great potential for Jamaica where marijuana has long been grown illegally on
[51:56.950 --> 51:58.310]  mountainsides and marshes
[51:58.310 --> 52:04.150]  The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use
[52:04.510 --> 52:08.550]  More than 20 US states allow some form of medical marijuana and last year
[52:08.990 --> 52:12.610]  Colorado and Washington legalized personal use on Tuesday
[52:12.610 --> 52:19.430]  Alaska Alaska became the third US state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults in the Americas euro
[52:19.990 --> 52:27.190]  Uruguay last year became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market in Argentina personal possession of marijuana was decriminalized under a
[52:27.430 --> 52:32.210]  2009 Supreme Court ruling that jail time for small amounts of drugs violates the country's Constitution
[52:32.310 --> 52:35.990]  That's fucking cool. And while in Chile permits use of medical marijuana
[52:36.630 --> 52:43.070]  Details of Jamaica's licensing authority and its hope for medical marijuana sector will need to be refined in upcoming months
[52:43.070 --> 52:46.670]  But for now Jamaican cannabis Crusaders applauded the amendments
[52:46.670 --> 52:48.470]  This is a big step in the right direction
[52:48.470 --> 52:55.350]  But there's still a lot of work to do said Delano's cyber right director of the cannabis commercial and medical task force
[52:55.590 --> 52:58.870]  So big up to Jamaica taking steps in the right right direction
[52:59.750 --> 53:01.470]  so much more
[53:01.470 --> 53:06.830]  Traveling and tourism is gonna happen there because people go there and get your medical marijuana now
[53:07.350 --> 53:14.670]  If they charge everybody even five bucks to 15 bucks or whatever to be able to legally consume without not have to worry about it
[53:14.670 --> 53:17.710]  While they're there that's gonna be millions for the government just up taxes
[53:18.150 --> 53:25.070]  California's like the only warm place that it's semi legal. So like all those in the summer we get 300 days of sunshine here
[53:25.070 --> 53:27.070]  Yeah, but it's it's hot
[53:27.910 --> 53:34.230]  Yeah, it does get pretty damn, you know, and I mean being closer to the equator, I'm sure it's hot but that beach sure does help
[53:36.070 --> 53:40.030]  Yeah, so Jamaica would be do yeah would be yeah, I can't wait for that to happen
[53:40.030 --> 53:45.150]  I don't know when it goes into effect, but I want to go visit now and go take some dabs in Jamaica
[53:45.150 --> 53:47.150]  I wonder if that's possible
[53:47.510 --> 53:49.510]  I'm sure they're down there already
[53:50.670 --> 53:53.070]  Boys got dreads and a blowtorch get him
[53:53.790 --> 53:57.710]  More things that I want to share with you guys that was enough news. I feel like
[53:58.830 --> 54:04.550]  We did the ladybug thing. Hey, somebody sent me an email about fermentation and your fermentation methods
[54:04.550 --> 54:11.210]  I'm going to address that but I'm wanting to do it when Sean's here. Sean is the guy to talk to about fermentations
[54:12.150 --> 54:15.710]  Let's see. So I got to do some shout outs. I want to give a big shout out to vigor lover
[54:15.710 --> 54:19.630]  Thanks for the t-shirt. That is fucking sweet and hashtag mids. That's mids

[54:26.750 --> 54:32.630]  James Holt dude, you sent me a compliment on Facebook and I told you thanks for listening
[54:32.630 --> 54:35.710]  He didn't seem to take me seriously. Like you seem like I was kind of dicking you around
[54:35.710 --> 54:39.990]  But no, I was fucking not condescending at all when I said that like I meant all of that
[54:39.990 --> 54:42.630]  and so I hope you listen to this and I hope you took me seriously because
[54:43.710 --> 54:49.390]  You're one of the most badass professional guitar players like not I'm not even saying you're up your professional
