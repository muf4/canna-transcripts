[00:00.320 --> 00:05.320]  Welcome to the show podcast world. It's time for episode 382 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.320 --> 00:10.320]  Once again, Mike is back. Happy New Year, bro. Happy New Year, buddy. Thanks for coming and hanging out with me.
[00:10.320 --> 00:15.320]  Yeah, man. Back due to popular demand. The people have spoken. They want more white Mike on the show.
[00:15.320 --> 00:19.320]  They have spoken. We will have more of thou white Mike.
[00:19.320 --> 00:24.320]  As always, this podcast is brought to you by our good friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company. That's right.
[00:24.320 --> 00:29.320]  It's the new year. It's time to add some fresh genetics to your garden. Get rid of that old stale shit.
[00:29.320 --> 00:35.320]  Grow some new shit. You can get that at the Hella Dank Seed Company at www.dankseed.store.
[00:35.320 --> 00:40.320]  We know it's tradition that we start the show by talking about what we're dabbing on. Mike is still coughing from it.
[00:40.320 --> 00:46.320]  I have to keep hesitating between sentences. Extra terpene, I think that's just plain guaranteed tar scraper.
[00:46.320 --> 00:50.320]  Yeah, I've got a little a little tickle in the lung there from that last dab we took.
[00:50.320 --> 00:57.320]  Not to brag, not to talk about how good our dabs are, but we took a little a apothecary farms internally flawless series diamond,
[00:57.320 --> 01:05.320]  broke a few little pieces off of that there, heated up the banger, dropped a diamond into there and then dropped a fat glob of lemon.
[01:05.320 --> 01:10.320]  Jeffrey full terpene, high terpene, full spectrum extract.
[01:10.320 --> 01:16.320]  Damn, I forgot the words now. Basically, lemon Jeffrey turps right on top of that dab, then capped it up.
[01:16.320 --> 01:19.320]  Mike took a little tiny micro dab. It took a pretty big fat dab of it.
[01:19.320 --> 01:24.320]  We both sat here and coughed and changed colors, played a fun game with Mike right as he blew out the dab.
[01:24.320 --> 01:29.320]  I said real quick, name this new cross I made and he tried to spit out straight names and it was funny to watch him scramble.
[01:29.320 --> 01:33.320]  Making words was hard enough than trying to put them together to make a straight name was pretty funny to watch.
[01:33.320 --> 01:37.320]  So words were hard. Good words were not possible.
[01:37.320 --> 01:43.320]  So we're smoking on. I was the internally flawless diamonds with the lemon Jeffrey turps on top of that.
[01:43.320 --> 01:48.320]  Before that, we may have had a few other random dabs. We may have hit the star dog.
[01:48.320 --> 01:53.320]  We probably hit the gorilla glue. Oh, wait, wait. The G4, you can't say gorilla glue anymore.
[01:53.320 --> 01:58.320]  And the goat power. We took a tab of something called Goat Power. It smells straight up like golden goat.
[01:58.320 --> 02:01.320]  I don't know what else that could be. I think it's just golden goat.
[02:01.320 --> 02:05.320]  But anyway, we've had plenty of dabs. I think Mike is well lit. I am heavily medicated.
[02:05.320 --> 02:08.320]  There may be a dab break here in the middle of the show.
[02:08.320 --> 02:12.320]  Doing good, man. But welcome to the show, everybody. Welcome, folks.
[02:12.320 --> 02:19.320]  Yeah, right over there, Mike. I'm good. Your eyes are we had a slight technical glitch at the beginning and Jeff pointed out something on the screen.
[02:19.320 --> 02:25.320]  And I'm having trouble not watching the audio feed record itself. It's still it's still doing the thing.
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.320]  We're cool. I'm confident that that works. It's got a lava lamp like appeal.
[02:29.320 --> 02:36.320]  Oh, yeah. Well, you just want to stare at it and watch that thing move up and down really hard not to see to watch my words make lines.
[02:36.320 --> 02:40.320]  I put the computer in a different spot so that I wouldn't do what Mike is doing right now.
[02:40.320 --> 02:44.320]  I catch myself staring at the little graph that, you know, when you talk into audio software, it makes a little graph.
[02:44.320 --> 02:47.320]  It shows how high it looks like a lie detector test on the screen.
[02:47.320 --> 02:52.320]  If you think about it that way, it's like it looks like the lines. It's doing that with my voice. It's jumping up and down.
[02:52.320 --> 02:59.320]  I sit here and stare into it while I talk. And that's why I use the headphone so I can stare into the screen and I can hear you clearly and not have to look and look around the table to hear people.
[02:59.320 --> 03:02.320]  And I stay with my voice under the mic and I can look into the thing. But now you're mesmerized.
[03:02.320 --> 03:09.320]  I may have to move it in the future so that I'm trying to focus on your notepad and notes right now. And it's not working because it's upside down to you.
[03:09.320 --> 03:13.320]  And you've got terrible eyesight. If you haven't picked up on it yet, we're glazed.
[03:13.320 --> 03:17.320]  We might have smoked a lot of dabs before this show. Happy New Year, you guys.
[03:17.320 --> 03:21.320]  Happy New Year. This is the second episode of the New Year, I do believe. If we're doing it right. 2019 it is.
[03:21.320 --> 03:24.320]  That's the first episode with Mike. Happy New Year, brother. Thanks for hanging out.
[03:24.320 --> 03:29.320]  Yeah, man. 2019 is going to be the more white Mike is my resolution. More white Mike on the show.
[03:29.320 --> 03:35.320]  Just more white Mike is a cool New Year's resolution for yourself. Just more white Mike, bro. That's it.
[03:35.320 --> 03:39.320]  All right, you guys, there is going to be content in this podcast. We're not just going to sit here and get rambly.
[03:39.320 --> 03:43.320]  Hi, there. We have those topics. Yes, we did write down some notes on a piece of paper.
[03:43.320 --> 03:46.320]  We're going to talk about some stuff. We just wanted to have fun at the start of the show.
[03:46.320 --> 03:50.320]  Settle in, get a vibe going. Who needs business right at the top of the show?
[03:50.320 --> 03:55.320]  It's always fun to have a good time. Mike, do you want to jump into this farm bill stuff? Are you ready for all of that?
[03:55.320 --> 04:00.320]  We most certainly can. OK, I am going to admit I said I'm going to read this farm bill thing.
[04:00.320 --> 04:05.320]  And Mike goes, bro, it's like 100 and something pages. And I was like, well, maybe I'll let you just tell me about it.
[04:05.320 --> 04:09.320]  And it's not just like 100 pages. It's not the first 100 pages of Harry Potter.
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.320]  It's 100 pages of some of the most dull language you could ever come across.
[04:14.320 --> 04:20.320]  Lawyers are evil. They literally lawyer means fucked up language. No one else understands that we argue.
[04:20.320 --> 04:24.320]  I'm married to one. Trust me, I'm an expert. Yes. Yes.
[04:25.320 --> 04:28.320]  But for those of you who took a look at it, it didn't feel like reading it.
[04:28.320 --> 04:37.320]  We're going to do kind of a light gloss over what the farm bill is, what all is jammed into it, why this year's was special.
[04:37.320 --> 04:46.320]  Hint it has to do with hemp legalization and what that means for hemp markets, CBD, all that good stuff.
[04:46.320 --> 04:52.320]  I'm so glad this is a Thursday episode and not a Monday episode. Thursday like a motherfucker.
[04:52.320 --> 04:55.320]  I think I'm spoiling them. I think I said I was not going to put out a Thursday.
[04:55.320 --> 04:59.320]  I was going to say I feel a little extra off leash because for two reasons.
[04:59.320 --> 05:04.320]  One, you straight up told people on Monday you weren't going to do a Thursday show.
[05:04.320 --> 05:10.320]  And I respected that as a listener because it's fucking New Year's. Go have some fun, buddy.
[05:10.320 --> 05:15.320]  But we had a chance to get together. So what I do with Thursday? Yeah, that's reason one. Reason two.
[05:15.320 --> 05:19.320]  I'm just in a really good mood and we've been having fun. So let's do a good fun show.
[05:19.320 --> 05:24.320]  I put up in a good mood and then I got you extra high. So, well, we got extra high together. I'm not going to blame it on me.
[05:24.320 --> 05:27.320]  Right. It wasn't like you tricked me.
[05:27.320 --> 05:31.320]  Try some of this one, bro. You want some of this blue candy?
[05:31.320 --> 05:33.320]  I'm looking at taking another one too.
[05:33.320 --> 05:37.320]  Dude, if you want another dab, you dig in that pile. This pile is inviting too, but it's the same shit that's in that pile.
[05:37.320 --> 05:41.320]  As we discussed last week, my brain wants to go outside for a different chemical.
[05:41.320 --> 05:43.320]  Oh yeah, well avoid those.
[05:43.320 --> 05:46.320]  But I'm going to skip that and not dab and not get baked-er.
[05:46.320 --> 05:47.320]  Baked-er?
[05:47.320 --> 05:48.320]  That's not a word. It's just fun to say.
[05:48.320 --> 05:49.320]  Baked-er. Higher stoned-er?
[05:49.320 --> 05:51.320]  Yep, stoned-er.
[05:51.320 --> 05:56.320]  Stone-der-der. Man, people are just fucking tuning out. We're just fucking gone on this episode.
[05:56.320 --> 05:58.320]  So the Farm Bill. Should we dive right into it?
[05:58.320 --> 06:05.320]  We are going to miss if we dive too hard. So let's just wait and then gently walk into the floor.
[06:05.320 --> 06:06.320]  We'll gently wade into it.
[06:06.320 --> 06:09.320]  All right, so kick your flip-flops off and slowly wade into it.
[06:09.320 --> 06:11.320]  This is getting weird.
[06:12.320 --> 06:17.320]  The Farm Bill is a major piece of federal legislation that we do every four years.
[06:17.320 --> 06:20.320]  I think it is, might be every five. I'm pretty sure it's every four years.
[06:20.320 --> 06:24.320]  And it covers a huge range of topics.
[06:24.320 --> 06:38.320]  Everything from how and where different agricultural crops get grown to food safety testing that's required to food stamps and nutrition programs in schools.
[06:39.320 --> 06:49.320]  I mean, it's a massive bill that covers all sorts of different things that are very loosely related to agriculture and food.
[06:49.320 --> 06:55.320]  And some of it gets very scientific and you wouldn't think about it when you think like farming or the Farm Bill.
[06:55.320 --> 07:00.320]  It has to do with like lab testing equipment and FDA rules and regulations also.
[07:01.320 --> 07:04.320]  It also has things like crop insurance for farmers.
[07:04.320 --> 07:14.320]  So if a tornado shows up and fucks up their soybean harvest, they're not just broke and destitute now that there's a form of federal insurance that they can apply for and things like that.
[07:14.320 --> 07:17.320]  So the Farm Bill is massive.
[07:17.320 --> 07:26.320]  And because it's huge and politics is kind of weird and quirky, a bunch of different things get attached to it every time they do it.
[07:27.320 --> 07:35.320]  And politicians use it as a way to get leverage on other people sometimes or you're not willing to jeopardize something you care about in it.
[07:35.320 --> 07:42.320]  So if they slip in a pet project of theirs, you're not going to torpedo their pet project because it's part of this thing you care about.
[07:44.320 --> 07:48.320]  And one of those little attachments this year was legalizing hemp.
[07:49.320 --> 08:03.320]  A Republican senator from Kentucky attached it to this year's Farm Bill and it passed without any fanfare outside of our small community, which is kind of surprising.
[08:03.320 --> 08:10.320]  The hemp has been illegal to grow in the U.S. for like 60 or 70 years.
[08:10.320 --> 08:13.320]  It was banned after World War II.
[08:13.320 --> 08:15.320]  It was re-banned after World War II.
[08:15.320 --> 08:17.320]  It was banned before World War II also.
[08:18.320 --> 08:27.320]  But it was re-banned basically under the theory that you could hide marijuana in hemp fields, which if you know anything about the cannabis plant, isn't really a thing.
[08:27.320 --> 08:29.320]  They both kind of ruin each other.
[08:29.320 --> 08:36.320]  And if you're growing the hemp for a reason and you grow marijuana in it and it cross-pollinates, you're going to fuck up your hemp harvest.
[08:36.320 --> 08:42.320]  And if your hemp harvest cross-pollinates with your cannabis harvest, you're going to ruin your cannabis harvest also.
[08:42.320 --> 08:50.320]  Not immediately, but especially 40, 50, 60 years ago when they were having this argument, it was exceptionally illogical.
[08:50.320 --> 08:52.320]  Sensimilia wasn't a thing.
[08:52.320 --> 08:55.320]  Crop separation, like we know now, isn't a thing.
[08:55.320 --> 09:03.320]  It would have been a major issue, but they managed to attach it to cannabis prohibition in general and fighting marijuana.
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.320]  And hemp's been illegal to grow across the U.S. for decades.
[09:08.320 --> 09:23.320]  And every time somebody brings up how moronic this is and how many different products that hemp could be and currently is being used in across the U.S., but we can't grow it, usually the DEA brings up their original objections.
[09:23.320 --> 09:27.320]  It can be used to hide marijuana or hide THC crops.
[09:27.320 --> 09:30.320]  It'll be confusing for law enforcement.
[09:30.320 --> 09:32.320]  It's been another one that I've always loved.
[09:33.320 --> 09:41.320]  They were real vocal in the 90s and early 1000s about how we can't legalize hemp because cops could never be trained to tell the difference.
[09:41.320 --> 09:45.320]  And they were open and honest about how they were sure that was a thing.
[09:45.320 --> 09:52.320]  Well, if you look at the two plants side by side, if I took you to a hemp farm and I was like, bro, show me the cannabis and show me the hemp, you couldn't tell the difference.
[09:52.320 --> 09:58.320]  Like if we went out to the big hemp farm out here on the highway on 96, there's a giant one on the right side of the road there.
[09:58.320 --> 09:59.320]  You see it when you drive out there.
[09:59.320 --> 10:01.320]  Those look like cannabis plants.
[10:01.320 --> 10:03.320]  If you get close and rub them, they've got trichomes.
[10:03.320 --> 10:08.320]  If you smell your fingers, it smells like that tora bora that we used to grow.
[10:08.320 --> 10:10.320]  It's got that Afghani cherry smell to it.
[10:10.320 --> 10:12.320]  They're growing a real Afghan cherry scent.
[10:12.320 --> 10:14.320]  They're growing for CBD, right?
[10:14.320 --> 10:15.320]  Yeah.
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.320]  Yeah.
[10:16.320 --> 10:20.320]  It's a specific type of hemp that they're using that grows similar to the plants we're talking about.
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.320]  A lot of the hemp for textiles is like 11 feet tall.
[10:25.320 --> 10:33.320]  It looks more like sugar cane or reeds in the river than it does like a bushy Christmas tree.
[10:33.320 --> 10:42.320]  Very skinny, single stock that goes way up and then you get a little, kind of looks like a bud at the very top, but the field looks very different.
[10:42.320 --> 10:47.320]  You can pull up hemp for victory and look at the two plants and they look fairly dissimilar.
[10:47.320 --> 10:48.320]  Okay.
[10:48.320 --> 10:58.320]  The main issue with hemp being illegal is hundreds and hundreds of US companies have to import it.
[10:58.320 --> 11:04.320]  It's been this weird rule where you can't grow it, but you can buy all of it that you'd like.
[11:04.320 --> 11:14.320]  If these objections are true for the growing plant, they're similarly true or equally true for the harvested plant, but we can import all we want.
[11:15.320 --> 11:21.320]  You've been able to buy, I mean, hemp is the brand that I always think of because it's the one my mom's used for 20 years.
[11:21.320 --> 11:24.320]  Oh, like the lotions and hand creams and shampoo.
[11:24.320 --> 11:25.320]  Yeah, the lotions and hand cream shops.
[11:25.320 --> 11:28.320]  One of her friends turned her onto the lotion back in like 1998.
[11:28.320 --> 11:30.320]  I call it Candle Shop Hemp Lotion.
[11:30.320 --> 11:31.320]  Yeah.
[11:31.320 --> 11:32.320]  That makes me think.
[11:32.320 --> 11:40.320]  It's just hemp seed oil is one of the ingredients in the lotion product, but they have to import all of that from another country to use in their products here.
[11:41.320 --> 11:45.320]  What this year's farm bill did is it finally opened up the market to US farmers.
[11:45.320 --> 11:48.320]  Now, we can produce our own hemp, which is huge.
[11:48.320 --> 12:00.320]  The fact that nobody spoke up with any of the dumbass objections of the past is, I think, another big symbol that legalization moving forward through education is definitely happening.
[12:00.320 --> 12:01.320]  Absolutely.
[12:01.320 --> 12:04.320]  Now, we don't have to import a large import product from Canada.
[12:04.320 --> 12:06.320]  I feel like that's where most of it was coming from.
[12:07.320 --> 12:11.320]  I mean, all over the planet, China grows hemp, Canada grows hemp, Japan grows hemp.
[12:11.320 --> 12:14.320]  Japan's using hemp right now to clean up Fukushima.
[12:14.320 --> 12:15.320]  Yeah.
[12:15.320 --> 12:27.320]  It's an incredibly versatile plant that's being used all over the world for, I mean, literally thousands of different uses, and we couldn't grow it here.
[12:27.320 --> 12:35.320]  I remember when I was in college a couple years after, so early 2000s, there was this Indian reservation that I want to say in Texas.
[12:35.320 --> 12:43.320]  And just by fate, their location coincides with an old hemp farm or whatever.
[12:43.320 --> 12:46.320]  And so there's just feral hemp all over this Indian reservation.
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.320]  And every five or 10 years, the cops would show up and be like, you're fucking, you're growing weed, get down.
[12:53.320 --> 12:54.320]  Right.
[12:54.320 --> 12:56.320]  And they'd spend 10 days being like, it's fucking feral hemp.
[12:56.320 --> 12:58.320]  Like, come, look around.
[12:58.320 --> 12:59.320]  No one's growing it.
[12:59.320 --> 13:00.320]  No one's harvesting it.
[13:00.320 --> 13:01.320]  Fuck off.
[13:01.320 --> 13:13.320]  And the local population got so fed up with these, like every five, six years, as soon as the cop in charge of the last raid isn't in charge of the raids anymore, someone sees the field from the air and freaks out again.
[13:13.320 --> 13:16.320]  And so they started coming up with different uses for it.
[13:16.320 --> 13:21.320]  And I think these are the people that really founded like hempcrete in the US and a couple of other things.
[13:21.320 --> 13:23.320]  And they were building whole houses.
[13:23.320 --> 13:34.320]  Everything except the glass and the doorknobs and stuff out of the hemp plant from the concrete to the insulation to the roofing panels were pressed out of something else.
[13:34.320 --> 13:36.320]  Like it was intense.
[13:36.320 --> 13:37.320]  Yeah.
[13:37.320 --> 13:40.320]  I've seen the hempcrete blocks and they try to light them on fire and they're really fire resistant.
[13:40.320 --> 13:42.320]  It's impressive how much heat they take.
[13:42.320 --> 13:47.320]  But even after they started all that, the feds showed up a handful of times and were like, what's with this big weed field?
[13:47.320 --> 13:50.320]  Like, that's just, we can't do anything about it.
[13:50.320 --> 13:51.320]  It's feral.
[13:51.320 --> 13:52.320]  Right.
[13:52.320 --> 13:54.320]  And if you keep cutting it down, it comes back, sir.
[13:54.320 --> 13:56.320]  But all of that is over.
[13:56.320 --> 14:09.320]  The weird little tidbit of this that I'm looking forward to is the feds have been including feral hemp seizures in their average potency numbers for the entire length of marijuana prohibition.
[14:09.320 --> 14:11.320]  Oh, I did not know that.
[14:11.320 --> 14:13.320]  I don't think anybody knows that.
[14:13.320 --> 14:14.320]  They just don't care.
[14:14.320 --> 14:15.320]  Yeah.
[14:15.320 --> 14:22.320]  As far as they're concerned, it's all cannabis and it's all the same illegal because under the law it was.
[14:22.320 --> 14:26.320]  And so they'd seize it, they'd test it and they'd throw it away.
[14:26.320 --> 14:33.320]  And by their process of doing it is they just grab all of the plant material and stuff in a trash bag.
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.320]  And then someone takes a handful of material out of that trash bag and they test it.
[14:37.320 --> 14:40.320]  And that's their average potency numbers.
[14:40.320 --> 14:42.320]  Leaves, sticks.
[14:42.320 --> 14:43.320]  Dirt.
[14:43.320 --> 14:44.320]  Dirt.
[14:44.320 --> 14:45.320]  Bird nests.
[14:45.320 --> 14:46.320]  Oh, my.
[14:46.320 --> 14:47.320]  Okay.
[14:47.320 --> 14:48.320]  So they went hard.
[14:48.320 --> 14:59.320]  They're just when they went in and really just tried to take the plant, they're still taking from the root, the top or the base of the stock right where it meets the root ball up.
[14:59.320 --> 15:03.320]  All of that's just a handful of that's going into their testing mix.
[15:03.320 --> 15:05.320]  And that's going to be high THC.
[15:05.320 --> 15:11.320]  One of the big anti-pot talking points for a long time is like modern marijuana is so much stronger than before.
[15:11.320 --> 15:19.320]  So now that hemp's not part of those numbers, I'm going to laugh when the average gets really hinky over the next couple of years when the data comes out.
[15:19.320 --> 15:20.320]  Okay.
[15:20.320 --> 15:21.320]  That'll be neat to watch.
[15:21.320 --> 15:22.320]  Yep.
[15:22.320 --> 15:24.320]  I'm going to laugh if there's a huge spike because the number seems low to me right now.
[15:24.320 --> 15:28.320]  They're still reporting at around 12.
[15:28.320 --> 15:30.320]  Is that a nationwide number?
[15:30.320 --> 15:31.320]  Yep.
[15:31.320 --> 15:37.320]  But yeah, keep in mind not everybody is in Colorado and not everybody's got the labs that the legalized states have.
[15:38.320 --> 15:41.320]  So if you're in pick a state that's got some illegal cannabis where I can get caught with some weed and be fucked.
[15:41.320 --> 15:42.320]  Arkansas.
[15:42.320 --> 15:43.320]  Okay.
[15:43.320 --> 15:44.320]  Let's say Arkansas.
[15:44.320 --> 15:49.320]  Imagine the back ass where it's live equipment in Arkansas to test for THC content.
[15:49.320 --> 15:53.320]  They're using the same equipment that they use for the rape kits and stuff.
[15:53.320 --> 15:54.320]  So it's decent equipment.
[15:54.320 --> 15:57.320]  It's just how they're testing and what they're testing.
[15:57.320 --> 15:58.320]  And also who's growing it.
[15:58.320 --> 16:00.320]  Fairhub's been a part of that for forever.
[16:00.320 --> 16:01.320]  Who's growing in Arkansas?
[16:01.320 --> 16:03.320]  Who's the lead grower in Little Rock?
[16:03.320 --> 16:05.320]  They do all their busts.
[16:05.320 --> 16:07.320]  They got to do their shit on the down low.
[16:07.320 --> 16:08.320]  They got to sneak again.
[16:08.320 --> 16:16.320]  They got to drive one dude's car to the grow store and buy shit and drive that car to the house and pull the garage and load up the other car and drive that in and sneak it all into the dark.
[16:16.320 --> 16:17.320]  They're back in that era.
[16:17.320 --> 16:21.320]  So well, in feral hemp busts are all over the country.
[16:21.320 --> 16:30.320]  You see, we get at least one or two good ones a year where the initial report is like massive marijuana field found in middle of nowhere.
[16:31.320 --> 16:38.320]  And then, you know, the next day is cops tear down 10,000 plants, 15,000 plants called a sophisticated operation.
[16:38.320 --> 16:41.320]  A week later, turns out it's feral hemp.
[16:41.320 --> 16:42.320]  It's been there for 30 years.
[16:42.320 --> 16:45.320]  It was just particularly wet this spring.
[16:45.320 --> 16:46.320]  And so it got out of hand.
[16:46.320 --> 16:47.320]  More seeds germinated.
[16:47.320 --> 16:48.320]  Someone noticed.
[16:48.320 --> 16:50.320]  And yeah, it happens.
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.320]  I mean, it's happened in the same spot in Texas like 10 times since I've been an adult.
[16:54.320 --> 16:56.320]  It's a pretty common occurrence.
[16:57.320 --> 17:08.320]  It'll be fun watching all this change and it'll be fun seeing the first hemp fields go up and then seeing the high school kids get busted, thinking that the signs that everywhere is saying this is how you can get stoned from it.
[17:08.320 --> 17:10.320]  Please don't break in and kill our plants.
[17:10.320 --> 17:16.320]  People are still going to hop that fence, come in, cut a plant down, run away, get pulled over a mile later.
[17:17.320 --> 17:18.320]  Feel stupid.
[17:18.320 --> 17:21.320]  Have a big old sticky, stinky plant in their car that's not worth a shit.
[17:21.320 --> 17:23.320]  Unless you're trying to make a necklace.
[17:24.320 --> 17:31.320]  But I'm really glad this past has been a lot of foolishness kind of in our community about this piece of the farm bill.
[17:31.320 --> 17:37.320]  There's a lot of I didn't read it and I'm assuming and I had bad information before this happened.
[17:37.320 --> 17:39.320]  And now I'm angry.
[17:41.320 --> 17:42.320]  That's put to find a point on it.
[17:42.320 --> 17:46.320]  If that sounded like I was talking about you, check your social media.
[17:48.320 --> 17:49.320]  I'm not.
[17:49.320 --> 17:50.320]  I'm standing silent over here.
[17:50.320 --> 17:51.320]  It's a.
[17:52.320 --> 18:01.320]  A lot of people were hoping that this would mean all CBD products were 100 percent legal for all uses and all marketing ploys.
[18:02.320 --> 18:04.320]  And that's just an insane idea.
[18:06.320 --> 18:07.320]  That's not how this works.
[18:07.320 --> 18:09.320]  That's how any of this works.
[18:09.320 --> 18:10.320]  They said hemp, not CBD.
[18:12.320 --> 18:18.320]  This is a huge move for textiles, for seed production, for paper production.
[18:19.320 --> 18:24.320]  I mean, you can make anything that we make currently from trees, oil or cotton.
[18:25.320 --> 18:29.320]  You can make with the hemp plant and that's thousands of thousands and thousands of things.
[18:30.320 --> 18:33.320]  Like most of the equipment we're using to make this show comes from some of those.
[18:34.320 --> 18:43.320]  Like all our clothes, everything we're sitting at, the drywall behind us, the gasoline in the cars I use to drive over here, like all of it.
[18:44.320 --> 18:45.320]  We can make with hemp.
[18:45.320 --> 18:47.320]  And so all of that's on the table for production now.
[18:48.320 --> 19:00.320]  But CBD and THC, especially if they're marketed with any sort of health effect at all, is covered by the FDA, just like they would be if they were any sort of other plant compound.
[19:01.320 --> 19:10.320]  If you market something in the US with any sort of health claim whatsoever, whether it's a mood stabilizer, helps with anxiety, depression, doesn't matter what it's helping with.
[19:10.320 --> 19:16.320]  If it's supposed to help with anything but fuck I'm hungry, it's got to go through a special set of FDA approvals.
[19:17.320 --> 19:19.320]  So is basically the difference on that.
[19:20.320 --> 19:21.320]  Say this is the patent.
[19:22.320 --> 19:24.320]  Grab a product. I'm grabbing a thing that's on my table so that I have an example.
[19:25.320 --> 19:27.320]  This label right here is not a food product.
[19:28.320 --> 19:29.320]  But what was I trying to say?
[19:30.320 --> 19:35.320]  If I put soothes hand pain, suddenly I have to have an FDA thing.
[19:36.320 --> 19:39.320]  But if on the back I just put the word CBD in my ingredients.
[19:40.320 --> 19:43.320]  If it just has CBD in the ingredients, I don't have to have an FDA stamp.
[19:44.320 --> 19:47.320]  But as soon as I make a claim, is that when I have to add that stamp?
[19:48.320 --> 19:49.320]  The F in FDA is food.
[19:50.320 --> 19:56.320]  And so they also oversee shit like cucumbers, lettuce, tomatoes, popsicles.
[19:57.320 --> 20:03.320]  And so if you have a CBD food item that you would like to make in Colorado and sell in Washington,
[20:04.320 --> 20:08.320]  and say it was a gummy that had CBD in it.
[20:09.320 --> 20:15.320]  And as long as you weren't like hyper marketing it, you would probably just have to go through the food approvals.
[20:16.320 --> 20:22.320]  Because at that point, it's just an ingredient like sugar or high fructose corn syrup, red dye number seven.
[20:23.320 --> 20:29.320]  However, as soon as you slap it on the front of the package and call it like these are CBD gummies,
[20:30.320 --> 20:34.320]  the FDA is probably going to want to know like, is that a flavor?
[20:35.320 --> 20:37.320]  It's not a flavor. All right, what is it?
[20:38.320 --> 20:41.320]  And as soon as that person being asked that question starts talking,
[20:42.320 --> 20:48.320]  they're going to likely end up in a place where that would have to go through the drug approvals as well.
[20:49.320 --> 20:54.320]  And if you go to a health food store, all of those herbal supplements have been through most of this.
[20:55.320 --> 20:57.320]  Or all of it, depending on what they're claiming.
[20:57.320 --> 20:59.320]  Yeah, they got the little purple star and they say FDA approved.
[21:00.320 --> 21:03.320]  Talking about a very specific brand because I worked at a health food store for quite a while.
[21:04.320 --> 21:09.320]  FDA approved doesn't mean it's a good effective treatment for whatever.
[21:10.320 --> 21:14.320]  It just means that there's enough evidence to say that that claim is probably true.
[21:15.320 --> 21:17.320]  And that it's also not bad for you.
[21:18.320 --> 21:19.320]  Like it's not going to kill you because you ate it.
[21:20.320 --> 21:24.320]  Like if it's got sesame seeds in it and you're allergic to sesame seeds, that's not what we're talking about here.
[21:24.320 --> 21:32.320]  But in our nation's history, we had a huge problem with fake medicines being marketed.
[21:33.320 --> 21:34.320]  And this is an answer to that.
[21:35.320 --> 21:42.320]  And there are a lot of people in our community that were outraged when the Farm Bill passed almost immediately after.
[21:43.320 --> 21:44.320]  Like the FDA knew this was coming.
[21:45.320 --> 21:48.320]  They know that these issues are a hot topic of conversation.
[21:48.320 --> 21:54.320]  So they released a memo or I don't remember what they called it, omissive to the public.
[21:55.320 --> 21:59.320]  Right after the Farm Bill was signed saying, this is awesome, but calm down.
[22:00.320 --> 22:02.320]  This doesn't apply to THC and CBD.
[22:03.320 --> 22:08.320]  Anything marketed with those two specifically because they've been marked as FDA compounds.
[22:09.320 --> 22:17.320]  And further, anything that claims to be a health food item that gets marketed in the US has to go through our approval process.
[22:18.320 --> 22:22.320]  And that still applies to all this CBD stuff that's hitting the market right now.
[22:23.320 --> 22:29.320]  And the FDA has been working for a couple of years now to rein in the CBD health market.
[22:30.320 --> 22:33.320]  Because a lot of it's just random nonsense claims that have no support.
[22:34.320 --> 22:35.320]  I did an episode called Something Fishy.
[22:36.320 --> 22:37.320]  It's about funky CBD products.
[22:38.320 --> 22:45.320]  They've found products on the market that claim to have one thing that they can't find it or they find it in different amounts.
[22:45.320 --> 22:47.320]  It says 100 milligrams of CBD.
[22:48.320 --> 22:49.320]  They find not 100 milligrams.
[22:50.320 --> 22:51.320]  Sometimes they find none at all.
[22:52.320 --> 22:54.320]  Sometimes they find compounds that aren't on the label.
[22:55.320 --> 22:56.320]  I was reading this.
[22:57.320 --> 23:00.320]  It was a crazy report that came out with the Farm Bill.
[23:01.320 --> 23:08.320]  Or right around the same time about a CBD bust where they went and bought up a whole bunch of the vape cartridges.
[23:09.320 --> 23:12.320]  And they ordered some online and they bought some from local vendors.
[23:12.320 --> 23:18.320]  And one of the products that kept turning up is one of the same ones that they put in Spice and K2.
[23:19.320 --> 23:25.320]  And that herbal crap you buy that's fake marijuana that won't hit pop or pop hot on a drug test.
[23:26.320 --> 23:30.320]  But it's a synthesized compound that's coming out of some secret lab in China or somewhere.
[23:31.320 --> 23:37.320]  That's very similar to Delta 9 THC but won't come up in a standard drug screen.
[23:38.320 --> 23:41.320]  And they're finding it in pure CBD vape pen cartridges and shit.
[23:42.320 --> 23:43.320]  In places like Alabama.
[23:44.320 --> 23:46.320]  Because the market is really unscrupulous.
[23:47.320 --> 23:49.320]  That's what the FDA is there for.
[23:50.320 --> 23:57.320]  When you buy something with that stamp that says FDA approved, that company's been inspected, they're regulated, they follow rules.
[23:58.320 --> 24:01.320]  Surprise inspections, product testing.
[24:02.320 --> 24:04.320]  Rigorous fucking product testing.
[24:05.320 --> 24:11.320]  All of it so that they know that when millions of these go out to the public, there's not going to be a crazy scare.
[24:13.320 --> 24:17.320]  There's so many people in our community that freaked out about this.
[24:18.320 --> 24:19.320]  Like, oh my god, look what you did.
[24:20.320 --> 24:22.320]  The FDA is going to take away CBD now.
[24:23.320 --> 24:25.320]  The cannabis industry is the biggest conspiracy theorist.
[24:26.320 --> 24:30.320]  As soon as one thing happens, they start projecting seven thoughts into the future.
[24:31.320 --> 24:35.320]  You remember the old hippie cliche to sit around and smoke a joint?
[24:36.320 --> 24:37.320]  Freak out about the government, man.
[24:38.320 --> 24:40.320]  That's what they fucking do for real in our industry a lot.
[24:40.320 --> 24:41.320]  A little bit too much.
[24:42.320 --> 24:45.320]  Yeah, it's not necessarily our fault.
[24:46.320 --> 24:47.320]  It comes from an honest place.
[24:48.320 --> 24:53.320]  For a long time in our history, if you stood up and were pro-cannabis, you were risking a lot.
[24:54.320 --> 24:56.320]  And so the only people that stood up had nothing to lose.
[24:57.320 --> 25:01.320]  And the people with nothing to lose, usually they never had anything to lose.
[25:02.320 --> 25:04.320]  And that's why they have nothing to lose now.
[25:05.320 --> 25:06.320]  And that's not necessarily the best spokesman.
[25:07.320 --> 25:08.320]  And that didn't help us at all.
[25:08.320 --> 25:14.320]  And our fringe and black market conspiracy theories have always been part of the community.
[25:15.320 --> 25:16.320]  Since the good old days.
[25:17.320 --> 25:20.320]  It's something about that type of person, the black market grower, the recluse.
[25:21.320 --> 25:22.320]  We're all super extra paranoid.
[25:23.320 --> 25:25.320]  You got to stand and peek out the windows and then your only friend is the internet.
[25:26.320 --> 25:30.320]  And YouTube starts telling you that everyone's watching you and that the Illuminati wants to steal your bacon.
[25:31.320 --> 25:32.320]  Right.
[25:33.320 --> 25:34.320]  It starts getting weird.
[25:36.650 --> 25:37.650]  So that's the Farm Bill, everybody.
[25:37.650 --> 25:48.650]  If you have questions about the Farm Bill, other provisions, if you want me to elaborate more about what it means for textile production or what other stuff you can make from hemp, you can Google most of that shit.
[25:49.650 --> 25:50.650]  But if you want to tweet at me, it's at Nemopunk15.
[25:51.650 --> 25:52.650]  Nemopunk15 on the tweeter.
[25:53.650 --> 25:55.650]  Or also, what about Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws?
[25:56.650 --> 26:00.650]  You can find me on Facebook at Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws as well.
[26:01.650 --> 26:02.650]  There you go. Or email me.
[26:02.650 --> 26:06.650]  You might have to search for that one a little harder if you're not already familiar with the Facebook page.
[26:07.650 --> 26:08.650]  Are they blocking the cannabis pages?
[26:09.650 --> 26:10.650]  Facebook's been doing that for months now.
[26:11.650 --> 26:12.650]  Okay. No search for you. Ha ha.
[26:13.650 --> 26:27.650]  Maybe six, eight months ago, Facebook decided to make it much harder to find anything cannabis related, which made me laugh my ass off because both sides of the conversation tend to use the words cannabis or marijuana.
[26:28.650 --> 26:29.650]  Oh, yeah.
[26:29.650 --> 26:35.650]  And so all of the anti-pot and cannabis pages vanished just as thoroughly as all of the pro.
[26:36.650 --> 26:37.650]  It makes me laugh.
[26:38.650 --> 26:39.650]  Yeah. Well, it's got to play fair.
[26:40.650 --> 26:41.650]  Got to play fair.
[26:42.650 --> 26:55.650]  So with this farm bill, do you see in the future that hemp will be tested in the same manner as cannabis, not just for cannabinoid content to ensure that it is not hot is the word we use for THC.
[26:56.650 --> 27:05.650]  If it's got too much THC, we call it hot and it's got to be destroyed or reallocated for different purposes, or it can be ran into a concentrate and then that concentrate can be separated.
[27:06.650 --> 27:07.650]  Yeah. It's something I learned recently.
[27:08.650 --> 27:10.650]  Do you feel that they will be doing pesticide testing?
[27:11.650 --> 27:13.650]  They're going to do.
[27:14.650 --> 27:16.650]  So it depends what the crops being produced for.
[27:17.650 --> 27:18.650]  Right. That's what I was going to get to.
[27:19.650 --> 27:20.650]  You're going to eat it.
[27:21.650 --> 27:22.650]  It's going to go through very separate testing.
[27:22.650 --> 27:33.650]  So when you buy whole hemp seed at the health food store, which you've been able to do for decades, it goes through the same food testing as the sunflower seeds at the gas station.
[27:34.650 --> 27:36.650]  Okay. All right. So there's no Michael butanol in those.
[27:37.650 --> 27:38.650]  There fucking shouldn't be.
[27:39.650 --> 27:41.650]  The same things with the textiles.
[27:42.650 --> 27:51.650]  Like if you buy a hemp T-shirt at the mall or online or whatever, it should have gone, all the material that went into that should have gone through the same testing is the cotton shirt or the polyester shirt that you bought.
[27:52.650 --> 27:55.650]  So that will in the future, all of the hemp will have to be tested for pesticides.
[27:56.650 --> 27:58.650]  It's currently not to my best understanding.
[27:59.650 --> 28:00.650]  Like if we went out to one of the local hemp farms, they don't have to.
[28:01.650 --> 28:05.650]  They do have to adhere to department of agriculture, pesticide rules and laws.
[28:06.650 --> 28:12.650]  But after that, there's no testing for pesticide presence or mold and mildews like we also test for in the industry.
[28:13.650 --> 28:14.650]  They don't test for any of that stuff.
[28:15.650 --> 28:16.650]  So I look forward to when they have to test for that.
[28:17.650 --> 28:18.650]  Sorry, you guys in the hemp industry.
[28:19.650 --> 28:20.650]  We're a smokable product.
[28:21.650 --> 28:22.650]  We're going to be eating a lot of this stuff.
[28:23.650 --> 28:24.650]  We mentioned earlier, it goes into gummy bears.
[28:25.650 --> 28:27.650]  What if it goes into a salve or I have family members.
[28:28.650 --> 28:29.650]  I don't want to call anybody out and get anybody in any trouble.
[28:30.650 --> 28:33.650]  I have a family member who has very bad arthritis and they use a lotion quite frequently.
[28:34.650 --> 28:37.650]  I don't want them rubbing fucking flora, my lotion for their skin.
[28:38.650 --> 28:39.650]  They're getting old.
[28:40.650 --> 28:41.650]  I don't need that.
[28:42.650 --> 28:44.650]  That should go through all the same testing that that everything else goes through.
[28:45.650 --> 28:56.650]  One of the big upsides to federal legalization that we just got with hemp is we already solved all those fucking problems for 90% of what we deal with every day.
[28:57.650 --> 29:00.650]  You don't have these worries when you buy a shirt or a hat or shoes online.
[29:01.650 --> 29:03.650]  You never think, were these socks treated with pesticides?
[29:04.650 --> 29:17.650]  Nope. I make a point to wash new clothes when they come into my house, but that's more like a paranoia thing because there's three episodes of shows I watched as a kid where the plot line was kid gets sick from jeans that didn't get washed.
[29:18.650 --> 29:23.650]  We've already solved all these problems for food safety, for clothing, textile safety.
[29:23.650 --> 29:26.650]  All these rules are already in place for a thousand other products.
[29:27.650 --> 29:33.650]  We just weren't allowed to use that infrastructure for hemp because hemp was federally illegal.
[29:34.650 --> 29:37.650]  It was a schedule one substance just like cannabis.
[29:38.650 --> 29:47.650]  The Farm Bill actually removed hemp from schedule one and changed the official wording of our federal drug statutes.
[29:48.650 --> 29:58.650]  That's what I mean when I say that it's weird that the DEA and the drug czar's office and all of that federal machinery didn't have fuck all to say about this.
[29:59.650 --> 30:04.650]  When they were quiet about it, this was leading up to, is it going to get put in the Farm Bill?
[30:05.650 --> 30:11.650]  Oh, it's in. Is it going to get passed by the Senate? Is it going to get passed by the House? Oh, is the president going to sign it?
[30:11.650 --> 30:19.650]  All of that, they were quiet. People like me that have been following this for 20 years were like, well, where's the normal chorus of dipshits?
[30:20.650 --> 30:22.650]  They just weren't there. It was just really kind of big news.
[30:23.650 --> 30:32.650]  Did, once again, I'm going back to the devil's advocate, was that the right hand going like this so that the left hand could come over here and pull some shit while we were going, look at the Farm Bill thing, look at the Farm Bill thing.
[30:33.650 --> 30:35.650]  They're over here just fucking carrying merchandise out the back door.
[30:36.650 --> 30:41.650]  It wasn't like when they're doing something for a distraction, they shout about it.
[30:42.650 --> 30:46.650]  There's some sparkle, there's some waving, there's some blood, something.
[30:47.650 --> 30:53.650]  With this, they were just like, hey, we've got bipartisan support for a Farm Bill. Isn't that nice?
[30:54.650 --> 30:59.650]  Everybody was like, yeah, but what about, and they were like, no, that's cool. We're just doing this real quick. It's done.
[31:00.650 --> 31:05.650]  End of the day, pro cannabis news outlets and a couple of others were like, yay, hemp's legal.
[31:06.650 --> 31:11.650]  The FDA was like, yeah, but CBD and THC are under the same rules that applied as always.
[31:12.650 --> 31:14.650]  That was pretty much it outside of the cannabis community.
[31:15.650 --> 31:20.650]  Even the people like Dr. Bronner's weren't like, we're going to bring up Dr. Bronner's.
[31:21.650 --> 31:24.650]  I wanted to make a joke earlier. Has anybody heard from Dr. Bronner? I think he passed.
[31:25.650 --> 31:31.650]  I kind of expected someone from his company or from a similar industry to be like, we're really thrilled about this.
[31:32.650 --> 31:34.650]  More tonight at nine, but there was none of that.
[31:35.650 --> 31:36.650]  I use that Dr. Bronner soap every single day.
[31:37.650 --> 31:45.650]  I own a number of hemp clothing items that I've had for years because they just last longer.
[31:46.650 --> 31:48.650]  You pay a little more, but it never wears out ever.
[31:49.650 --> 31:53.650]  That is the truth. Good hemp quality. I'm looking to see what I'm wearing now and there's no hemp on me.
[31:54.650 --> 31:55.650]  It's maybe hemp. I'm not sure though.
[31:56.650 --> 31:58.650]  I've known countless people that were into that Dr. Bronner soap.
[31:59.650 --> 32:05.650]  One of the things that made me laugh is the anti-pot crowd kind of freaked out with this.
[32:06.650 --> 32:09.650]  They're like, I'm sure this is just backdoor legalization again.
[32:10.650 --> 32:13.650]  The farm bill's bad. Look at this hemp product.
[32:14.650 --> 32:17.650]  I found it at Target the other day and it was actually the hemp's brand.
[32:18.650 --> 32:22.650]  I just laughed so hard. I'm like, wait, you're half the age of my mom.
[32:22.650 --> 32:25.650]  She's been using that lotion the whole time we've been alive.
[32:26.650 --> 32:30.650]  You think this has something to do with the farm bill that goes into effect on January 1st?
[32:31.650 --> 32:32.650]  It's not even January 1st, ya lady.
[32:33.650 --> 32:34.650]  They're just so fucking stupid.
[32:35.650 --> 32:36.650]  Once you're against something, you're against it.
[32:37.650 --> 32:38.650]  Once you're programmed, you're programmed.
[32:39.650 --> 32:41.650]  Unless you get reprogrammed or unprogrammed, you might be stuck.
[32:42.650 --> 32:49.650]  That's true for most topics, but at this point, anyone who cares enough to have an opinion either way
[32:49.650 --> 32:50.650]  has checked on it a little bit.
[32:51.650 --> 32:57.650]  The only people left in the hardcore anti-camp are either, a long time ago,
[32:58.650 --> 33:02.650]  they committed to a life of talking bad about pot and getting paid for it.
[33:03.650 --> 33:04.650]  That's their thing.
[33:06.650 --> 33:10.650]  If they go outside of that at all, they have to come up with a whole new everything.
[33:11.650 --> 33:14.650]  A lot of those people have that story of how, I sound like an asshole right now,
[33:14.650 --> 33:19.650]  how one of their friends drank 17 beers at a party and smoked a joint and then left
[33:20.650 --> 33:22.650]  and got in a wreck and killed themselves and they blame cannabis.
[33:23.650 --> 33:24.650]  Yeah, that's a bunch of them.
[33:25.650 --> 33:28.650]  The big one, Kevin Sebette, he figured out when he was in college
[33:29.650 --> 33:32.650]  that he could get people to give him money for being the guy that wears a suit
[33:33.650 --> 33:36.650]  and is like, I'm kind of likable and marijuana is terrible.
[33:37.650 --> 33:39.650]  He's made a pretty good life.
[33:40.650 --> 33:41.650]  That's a basic good description of that guy too.
[33:41.650 --> 33:42.650]  I wear a suit and kind of likable.
[33:43.650 --> 33:46.650]  He's worked for three presidents, two or three presidents.
[33:47.650 --> 33:51.650]  I think he might've worked two administrations for Bush and then one for Obama.
[33:52.650 --> 33:55.650]  I think it's his claim to fame, but he might've been Clinton, Bush, Obama.
[33:56.650 --> 33:57.650]  I'm not sure.
[33:58.650 --> 34:01.650]  But he worked for the drug czar's office for a while and now he's got a company
[34:02.650 --> 34:04.650]  where people just give him money that they worked hard for
[34:05.650 --> 34:08.650]  so that he can continue to go around the country and bash legal weed.
[34:08.650 --> 34:09.650]  It's kind of nuts.
[34:10.650 --> 34:13.650]  And he, uh, about five years ago made a point to stop taking donations
[34:14.650 --> 34:17.650]  from these people's companies that like drug tests or run rehabs and stuff.
[34:18.650 --> 34:21.650]  And he only takes checks from the person themselves.
[34:22.650 --> 34:24.650]  And so like, if Jeff, if you were to send me a check in this manner,
[34:25.650 --> 34:27.650]  you wouldn't send it from Irish Genetics, Colorado.
[34:28.650 --> 34:29.650]  You would send it from Jeff.
[34:30.650 --> 34:31.650]  Really?
[34:31.650 --> 34:34.650]  And so that way I could be like, I only take donations from private citizens.
[34:35.650 --> 34:37.650]  I don't take donations from private citizens.
[34:38.650 --> 34:39.650]  I take corporate money.
[34:40.650 --> 34:41.650]  That's whack.
[34:42.650 --> 34:43.650]  Um, but it's a cute little play that he's been running.
[34:44.650 --> 34:45.650]  Yeah.
[34:45.650 --> 34:46.650]  I don't know where this tangent came from, but enjoy that tidbit folks.
[34:47.650 --> 34:48.650]  There you go.
[34:49.650 --> 34:50.650]  That's a great way to start segwaying since I'm getting Mike a dab ready.
[34:51.650 --> 34:52.650]  Anyway.
[34:52.650 --> 34:53.650]  Um, guys, thank you for enduring 38.
[34:54.650 --> 34:55.650]  I don't know how much of that got edited.
[34:56.650 --> 34:57.650]  Approximately 38 minutes of a podcast.
[34:58.650 --> 34:59.650]  That's that's you should finish it.
[35:00.650 --> 35:01.650]  Like that's my report on the farm bill guys.
[35:02.650 --> 35:03.650]  Thank you so much for listening.
[35:04.650 --> 35:05.650]  Oh, you had to do it.
[35:06.650 --> 35:07.650]  You bastard.
[35:08.650 --> 35:09.650]  I get why a lot of people can't wade through this shit on their own and make
[35:10.650 --> 35:11.650]  sense of it.
[35:12.650 --> 35:13.650]  Like it's designed to be really complicated and kind of hard to
[35:14.650 --> 35:15.650]  understand.
[35:16.650 --> 35:17.650]  Yeah.
[35:17.650 --> 35:18.650]  I just tried to kill Mike with the dab.
[35:19.650 --> 35:20.650]  I was going to give him, I had to rethink.
[35:21.650 --> 35:22.650]  Yeah.
[35:22.650 --> 35:23.650]  I don't need all the dabs.
[35:24.650 --> 35:25.650]  I would just like a small one.
[35:26.650 --> 35:27.650]  I'm going to just knock most of this off the dab and give you the part that
[35:28.650 --> 35:29.650]  sticks.
[35:30.650 --> 35:31.650]  So I'm going to put this back on track.
[35:32.650 --> 35:33.650]  I thought it was hilarious.
[35:34.650 --> 35:35.650]  It might come in.
[35:36.650 --> 35:37.650]  That was a good burn.
[35:38.650 --> 35:39.650]  I'm not sure if you got bored as fuck, but some people are really interested
[35:40.650 --> 35:41.650]  in that too.
[35:42.650 --> 35:43.650]  That was for if you got bored, then there'll be a Monday show.
[35:44.650 --> 35:45.650]  It'll be about growing canvases.
[35:46.650 --> 35:47.650]  We'll be back on track.
[35:48.650 --> 35:49.650]  I've probably seen 300 people online in our community arguing about what the
[35:50.650 --> 35:51.650]  farm bill did and didn't do.
[35:52.650 --> 35:53.650]  And two hundred ninety nine of them had no fucking idea what they were
[35:54.650 --> 35:55.650]  talking about.
[35:56.650 --> 35:57.650]  So I'm glad to help clear up the air for anyone who wanted to listen.
[35:58.650 --> 35:59.650]  That's what we brought you here for.
[36:00.650 --> 36:01.650]  All right.
[36:01.650 --> 36:02.650]  I'm going to give you a dab.
[36:03.650 --> 36:04.650]  You're going to take a dab.
[36:05.650 --> 36:06.650]  All right.
[36:06.650 --> 36:07.650]  I'm going to give Mike a dab.
[36:08.650 --> 36:09.650]  He is probably still coughing.
[36:10.650 --> 36:11.650]  We had to wrap up the show.
[36:12.650 --> 36:13.650]  You can find Mike on social media.
[36:14.650 --> 36:15.650]  Make sure you find him on Facebook at Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws.
[36:16.650 --> 36:17.650]  You can also find him on Twitter.
[36:18.650 --> 36:19.650]  He's Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter.
[36:20.650 --> 36:21.650]  Give him a follow.
[36:22.650 --> 36:23.650]  I would appreciate it if you also follow the show on Twitter.
[36:24.650 --> 36:25.650]  You can find the show at GFYH podcast on Twitter.

[36:36.650 --> 36:37.650]  All the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[36:38.650 --> 36:39.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you for listening to this episode.
[36:40.650 --> 36:41.650]  I want to thank Mike again for coming and hanging out,
[36:42.650 --> 36:43.650]  taking time away from his family to come record a podcast.
[36:44.650 --> 36:45.650]  I will be back Monday with a fresh new grow lesson.
[36:46.650 --> 36:47.650]  I hope you guys join me for that.
[36:48.650 --> 36:49.650]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Slaughterhouse Cannabis.
[36:50.650 --> 36:51.650]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
