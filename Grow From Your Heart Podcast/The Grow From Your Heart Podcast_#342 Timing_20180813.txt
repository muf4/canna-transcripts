[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  The best thing on Periscope is watching people do dabs.
[00:06.900 --> 00:08.580]  Welcome back, podcast world.
[00:08.580 --> 00:12.180]  It's time for Episode 342 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:12.180 --> 00:15.680]  Your source for cannabis news, education and conversation.
[00:16.720 --> 00:19.360]  That's right. If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:19.360 --> 00:22.960]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist
[00:22.960 --> 00:25.960]  or even someone who is just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:26.200 --> 00:28.700]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:29.100 --> 00:31.100]  I'm your host. My friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:31.100 --> 00:33.040]  I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:33.040 --> 00:36.440]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:36.460 --> 00:38.840]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.380]  the Hella Dank Seed Company and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:43.980 --> 00:46.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, smokers and growers,
[00:46.940 --> 00:51.020]  roll up a fat spliff, pack up a bong load or start heating up that dab nail
[00:51.140 --> 00:54.920]  because it's time for a fresh episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:58.000 --> 00:59.400]  Welcome back, Internet world.
[00:59.420 --> 01:03.200]  It's time for episode 342 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:03.200 --> 01:05.060]  Thanks again for joining me.
[01:05.060 --> 01:07.660]  Before I get too far, let me give a shout out to Martin Land
[01:07.660 --> 01:09.440]  for that great backing track.
[01:09.440 --> 01:12.680]  Thanks to the wonderful intro music. I do appreciate that.
[01:13.740 --> 01:17.140]  You guys, I'm recording this podcast on late in the evening on August 8th.
[01:17.180 --> 01:19.420]  It is a beautiful day. It's been a beautiful day.
[01:19.620 --> 01:21.540]  The past few days have not been as beautiful.
[01:21.540 --> 01:25.420]  All of the outdoor growers are working for their money this season.
[01:25.420 --> 01:28.460]  If you've got outdoor plants in southern Colorado,
[01:28.680 --> 01:31.980]  you are working your ass off the past couple of days because it has been raining.
[01:32.220 --> 01:34.460]  It has been hailing like crazy.
[01:34.460 --> 01:36.620]  Golf ball sized hail was not an issue.
[01:36.620 --> 01:40.000]  It was the grapefruit sized hail. It was damaging things.
[01:40.020 --> 01:41.720]  There's a zoo in Colorado Springs.
[01:41.720 --> 01:43.360]  They got the shit beat out of that zoo.
[01:43.360 --> 01:45.600]  Animals died. People were taken to the hospital.
[01:45.860 --> 01:48.400]  It has been crazy weather wise here in Colorado.
[01:48.540 --> 01:50.700]  So if you're growing outdoors this year, much respect.
[01:50.700 --> 01:52.080]  You are working your ass off.
[01:52.080 --> 01:53.640]  I hope it goes well for you.
[01:53.640 --> 01:58.040]  Also, if you're facing a wildfire and your cannabis grow, good luck with that.
[01:58.060 --> 01:59.720]  That's got to be some scary shit.
[01:59.720 --> 02:00.720]  I hope it all goes well.
[02:00.720 --> 02:03.560]  I hope everybody stays safe, even if you don't have a cannabis grow.
[02:03.700 --> 02:07.340]  I hope things go well for you with all of the wildfires in California.
[02:08.400 --> 02:11.340]  All right. I did say I'm recording late in the evening on August 8th.
[02:11.380 --> 02:13.700]  This will not come out until August 13th.
[02:13.700 --> 02:16.240]  I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself.
[02:16.240 --> 02:17.720]  I've got a little vacation coming up.
[02:17.720 --> 02:20.680]  I'm trying to get prepared so I don't miss an episode.
[02:21.080 --> 02:22.440]  Let's get the show on track.
[02:22.440 --> 02:25.860]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking on
[02:26.020 --> 02:27.300]  today and this evening.
[02:27.300 --> 02:31.100]  I've been taking dabs of Fatso Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[02:31.260 --> 02:34.540]  This is a combination of GMO and Legend OG.
[02:34.900 --> 02:39.740]  The flavor is described as dark roast coffee, garlic and fuel.
[02:39.740 --> 02:42.500]  I absolutely got all three of those flavors in there.
[02:42.940 --> 02:47.580]  On the inhale, you get the dark roast coffee, maybe a little yerba mate flavor,
[02:47.580 --> 02:49.300]  a little bit of sweetness on the inhale.
[02:49.700 --> 02:52.540]  Then as you exhale it, that's where the fuel came in for me.
[02:52.580 --> 02:56.140]  As the smoke went across my tongue and across my lips on the exhale,
[02:56.420 --> 02:58.300]  that's where I picked up that fuel flavor.
[02:58.900 --> 03:01.020]  Then as it sat there for a moment, I exhaled.
[03:01.260 --> 03:03.300]  I closed my mouth. I licked my lips. I took a breath.
[03:03.300 --> 03:05.180]  And that's when the garlic flavor kicked in.
[03:05.180 --> 03:08.580]  I had garlic breath from this dab. It's enjoyable.
[03:08.860 --> 03:11.380]  I really like it. It's warm, it's savory.
[03:11.380 --> 03:14.220]  And the high from it is just right. It's settled in.
[03:14.820 --> 03:17.660]  It's like comfort high. It's like comfort food and a comfort high.
[03:17.660 --> 03:19.860]  It's got that garlicky comfort food flavor.
[03:20.180 --> 03:22.900]  It's savory and real nice. And it tastes like it would be warm.
[03:22.900 --> 03:25.820]  If this was food, it would be like warm garlic mashed potatoes.
[03:26.260 --> 03:29.060]  And then it settles in with this nice body warming high.
[03:29.060 --> 03:32.140]  It's like wearing a sweater. It's nice and chilling on my head.
[03:32.700 --> 03:35.540]  It's got me nice and mellowed out. It's really nice.
[03:35.540 --> 03:38.420]  And it's honestly way different than what I normally would purchase.
[03:38.420 --> 03:41.180]  Usually I want something that's going to make my brain skyrocket,
[03:41.220 --> 03:44.820]  spin around and make me forget where I put my keys and lose my sunglasses while
[03:44.820 --> 03:47.940]  they're on my head. But this fatso nectar has just got me chilling.
[03:47.980 --> 03:51.940]  And I really enjoy it. So I'm smoking on the fatso nectar from green dot labs.
[03:51.940 --> 03:54.140]  They do not pay me. You guys, I pay for this stuff.
[03:54.700 --> 03:56.620]  I just like to share what I'm smoking with the audience.
[03:56.660 --> 03:59.900]  So you guys know why I sound like I'm only at half speed for the first 10
[03:59.900 --> 04:03.380]  minutes of the show. A couple of episodes ago,
[04:03.380 --> 04:06.620]  I spoke for far too long about insert dabs.
[04:06.780 --> 04:10.900]  I'm going to take a little less time than I spent on insert dabs to talk about
[04:11.060 --> 04:14.940]  something else. I was sent. My friends at happy daddy sent me a very nice care
[04:14.940 --> 04:16.580]  package. They sent me a banger.
[04:16.900 --> 04:19.740]  They sent me a, an insert. They sent me a carb cap.
[04:20.020 --> 04:21.820]  They sent me a couple of great dabbers.
[04:22.020 --> 04:26.300]  They also sent me some Terp spinners also known as Terp pearls.
[04:26.540 --> 04:29.020]  I've seen them labeled as different things in different markets.
[04:29.220 --> 04:32.620]  They're all the same thing. They are tiny glass balls. Uh,
[04:32.620 --> 04:36.460]  it's like the size of a P it's the perfect size of a P I think this is somewhere
[04:36.460 --> 04:40.300]  between seven and nine millimeters is the size of this little ball here.
[04:40.580 --> 04:43.500]  So the idea is you put one or two, or you could put more, if you want,
[04:43.500 --> 04:47.500]  I put two inside the banger. I've got a banger. It is fairly deep. Um,
[04:47.540 --> 04:50.820]  if you don't know what a banger is, I'm, I won't go too far into that. It is,
[04:50.820 --> 04:54.900]  it looks like a glass thimble that attaches to your rig,
[04:54.920 --> 04:58.140]  which is a small bong. Don't use a big rig. Use a small rig. You guys,
[04:58.140 --> 05:01.020]  there's so many reasons why a small rig is better than a big rig.
[05:01.020 --> 05:02.660]  You don't want to smoke a gallon of oxygen.
[05:02.660 --> 05:04.220]  You don't need a liter of air into your lung.
[05:04.220 --> 05:07.100]  You want to get a fucking dab to your face. Okay. And a bong,
[05:07.140 --> 05:09.460]  you fill it up with all that smoke, right? You smoke and smoke and smoke.
[05:09.460 --> 05:11.620]  And then once that chamber is filled, you pull it and then you get all that
[05:11.620 --> 05:13.940]  smoke. Boom. There's no need to do that with a rig.
[05:13.940 --> 05:16.940]  You want to press that dab against the nail and you want that smoke to go to
[05:16.940 --> 05:20.180]  your brain. And since I'm ranting, since I'm going off on a side right here,
[05:20.860 --> 05:23.700]  when you're putting the carb cap on quit taking it off, like I get it.
[05:23.700 --> 05:26.460]  You're going to lift it off for a second to carb the dab so that you can get all
[05:26.480 --> 05:28.860]  that smoke out of the rig. And then you can take a fresh pool when you go back
[05:28.860 --> 05:31.220]  in, but leave the carb cap on there when you're dabbing,
[05:31.220 --> 05:32.420]  because every time you take it off,
[05:32.420 --> 05:35.100]  you're letting heat out and it's changing the temperature of that oil.
[05:35.100 --> 05:36.940]  That's in there and things. It's just leave it on there.
[05:36.940 --> 05:39.580]  It'll work better for you. It's so frustrating to see everyone on Instagram.
[05:39.860 --> 05:40.900]  They put the carb cap on,
[05:40.900 --> 05:43.860]  they give it a swirl and they take the carb cap off and exhale their dab.
[05:44.140 --> 05:45.100]  They get their brain together.
[05:45.100 --> 05:47.100]  Then they put the cap on and go back for another pool.
[05:47.220 --> 05:48.540]  If you would've left that cap on there,
[05:48.740 --> 05:52.340]  it would have been more beneficial for you in my opinion and in my experience.
[05:52.500 --> 05:56.580]  So let me get back on track. This, uh, banger it's called the banger.
[05:56.580 --> 05:59.540]  It's the dab nail. It attaches to my rig.
[05:59.700 --> 06:01.820]  It's got a thimble like piece of glass on it.
[06:02.380 --> 06:06.300]  So I heat that thimble like piece of glass. First, I drop my glass ball in there.
[06:07.460 --> 06:08.780]  I don't know if you heard that on the mic or not.
[06:08.980 --> 06:11.580]  Just put a little couple of glass balls inside of the banger.
[06:12.060 --> 06:16.020]  Then I heat the banger where the wall and the floor meet.
[06:16.020 --> 06:17.860]  I heat at an angle right at that corner.
[06:17.860 --> 06:21.100]  I try to heat that corner up right there. I move around the base of the rig.
[06:21.100 --> 06:23.020]  I want most of my heat down there on the bottom.
[06:23.060 --> 06:24.860]  That's where my dab is going to go.
[06:25.340 --> 06:28.420]  The base of my new banger from happy daddy and black market glass,
[06:28.420 --> 06:29.580]  the base is fairly thick.
[06:29.580 --> 06:32.700]  So I got to heat it for kind of a little bit and then let it cool just to the
[06:32.700 --> 06:36.100]  right temperature. Those balls that I've got in there are also heated.
[06:36.300 --> 06:38.380]  They're going to help maintain temperature. Now,
[06:38.580 --> 06:42.900]  I can scoop up a gigantic dab and I can drop that dab in there. Now,
[06:42.900 --> 06:47.140]  as soon as the oil hits the nail, science says that it starts cooling that
[06:47.140 --> 06:48.980]  combination. It starts getting cooler, right?
[06:48.980 --> 06:50.500]  So if you put a real big dab in there,
[06:50.740 --> 06:53.340]  you got to start smoking it quickly because you're losing all of your
[06:53.340 --> 06:57.300]  temperature. So you throw a carb cap on there that helps you stoke that heat in
[06:57.300 --> 06:58.580]  there. It helps you, uh,
[06:58.940 --> 07:03.740]  vaporize your dab at a lower temperature because it creates a vacuum. The let,
[07:03.780 --> 07:05.900]  there's less air pressure coming in. There's heat in there.
[07:05.900 --> 07:07.780]  It takes less heat to cook your dab.
[07:08.620 --> 07:11.780]  Now I got this glass ball in there. It was in there when I heated the nail.
[07:11.980 --> 07:15.380]  So that's also got heat in it. When I put the carb cap on there,
[07:15.980 --> 07:19.980]  it takes a specific carb cap. A non-directional carb cap is better.
[07:19.980 --> 07:24.300]  You need a carb cap that points straight down and has semi-decent airflow.
[07:25.020 --> 07:28.340]  So you put the carb cap on there. And when you start smoking these Terp spinners,
[07:28.580 --> 07:32.620]  they start doing a little dance inside the nail. And if you suck just right,
[07:32.700 --> 07:36.580]  and I'm not going to edit that out, I probably should. If you inhale just right.
[07:36.580 --> 07:38.220]  If you pull it just the right speed,
[07:38.500 --> 07:41.540]  you'll get those little beads in there to spin around inside your nail.
[07:42.060 --> 07:43.900]  They'll lift up and start spinning inside there.
[07:43.900 --> 07:47.380]  Like they're little kids on the Gravitron. It's pretty neat to watch. It's cool.
[07:48.220 --> 07:51.700]  Then when your dab is done, you grab a Q-tip and you clean out the banger.
[07:52.020 --> 07:54.860]  And then you've got to get those little balls out there and kind of clean them
[07:54.860 --> 07:58.500]  off too. I get just a paper towel and some isopropyl alcohol.
[07:58.940 --> 08:01.660]  I get the Q-tip and clean it out the best I can. And then once it cools,
[08:01.660 --> 08:03.220]  I just take the banger right off the rig,
[08:03.220 --> 08:06.580]  dump the little balls into the, uh, ISO soaked paper towel,
[08:06.580 --> 08:07.420]  and just rub them down,
[08:07.700 --> 08:10.460]  rub your balls down and get them nice and clean and then just drop them right
[08:10.480 --> 08:12.220]  back into the banger. And they're cool.
[08:13.340 --> 08:16.700]  I liked the way it helps spin my dab around.
[08:16.740 --> 08:18.980]  When you put the dab directly onto the hot glass,
[08:18.980 --> 08:21.980]  it likes to singe if you have it too hot, it'll just scorch it right up.
[08:23.100 --> 08:26.100]  That's what a liquid is going to do when it hits glass. It's going to vaporize.
[08:26.100 --> 08:27.380]  It's going to boil basically.
[08:27.660 --> 08:31.460]  So when you put the Terp spinners in there and it's moving the oil around,
[08:31.620 --> 08:35.180]  you can let it go a little cooler on the temperature. And then,
[08:36.220 --> 08:38.940]  because you don't have to go in, let's see how I can say this.
[08:39.340 --> 08:43.620]  Since it's going to retain heat longer, I can let it cool a little bit more.
[08:43.940 --> 08:45.340]  So I can go in a little cooler.
[08:45.340 --> 08:47.980]  And I know that those little hot balls in there are going to spin around.
[08:48.300 --> 08:50.780]  They're going to keep my dab cooking because they've retained heat,
[08:50.780 --> 08:54.220]  but they're also going to splash that oil around on the nail to where it doesn't
[08:54.220 --> 08:57.020]  sit in a hot spot and scorch it's moving. So it's got,
[08:57.340 --> 08:59.420]  that's like flipping the veggies in the frying pan.
[08:59.700 --> 09:04.380]  So it's cooking my oil slowly and I'm getting a more of a vaporized hit instead
[09:04.380 --> 09:06.660]  of a burnt hit. And I'm getting a lot more Terps out of it.
[09:07.420 --> 09:09.780]  So now I'm going to compare the,
[09:09.780 --> 09:12.100]  I said that it wasn't going to be as long as the insert dab talk,
[09:12.100 --> 09:13.380]  but I probably that up already.
[09:13.580 --> 09:16.220]  I'm going to kind of compare the insert dab to the spinners.
[09:16.940 --> 09:19.820]  The spinners are fun. The spinners are cool. They're really novel.
[09:19.820 --> 09:22.900]  It's fun to watch. It's fun for your friends to go, Oh, that's cool.
[09:22.900 --> 09:27.380]  I see it spinning there. Really didn't do too much improvement on my dab.
[09:27.580 --> 09:31.980]  I know I just said that I was able to cook it at a lower temperature. Yeah,
[09:31.980 --> 09:35.580]  that's cool. I could really do that way better with the insert dab.
[09:35.740 --> 09:37.500]  The insert dab crushes it.
[09:37.860 --> 09:41.340]  If I'm in the mood for a giant dab and I really want to take a chunky dab,
[09:41.340 --> 09:43.500]  the insert dab is the way to do it. I get the little,
[09:43.700 --> 09:48.020]  the smaller thimble and I load that sucker up and then I feel like I can heat the
[09:48.020 --> 09:52.540]  shit out of that nail. And I haven't really overheated to do an insert dab yet.
[09:52.540 --> 09:55.580]  I haven't gotten that scorched flavor. I haven't really fried my lungs yet.
[09:55.700 --> 09:57.940]  It feels like the insert dab is the way to go.
[09:58.060 --> 10:00.820]  And the turps and the high are tremendous from the insert dab.
[10:00.820 --> 10:04.780]  So the turps spinners are cool. They're fun. They're very novel.
[10:04.940 --> 10:07.100]  You need the appropriate carb cap to make it work.
[10:07.100 --> 10:08.220]  If you don't have the right carb cap,
[10:08.240 --> 10:10.220]  you're going to just suck so hard and you're going to be like,
[10:10.220 --> 10:13.660]  they don't move at all. And the little balls are just going to sit there.
[10:13.660 --> 10:17.140]  But if you've got the appropriate carb cap and the appropriate nail and you can
[10:17.140 --> 10:20.500]  get the pressure right, they will spin around in there. It's fun. It's novel.
[10:20.900 --> 10:25.340]  It's cool. A couple of times I got burned out on it and I hit the insert more.
[10:25.620 --> 10:26.620]  Honestly, you guys,
[10:26.820 --> 10:30.620]  I find myself hitting my basic thermal banger more than anything.
[10:31.380 --> 10:34.340]  I've got it timed out to where I know exactly how long to heat it,
[10:34.340 --> 10:38.260]  how long to let it cool. I know just how big of a dab that amount of heat can
[10:38.260 --> 10:41.980]  take. I know when to throw that dab in there. I know it'd get the carb cap on there.
[10:41.980 --> 10:45.220]  I know how hard I can pull to get the air through the carb cap and still not get
[10:45.240 --> 10:47.620]  water into my mouth. If I suck on that rig too hard,
[10:47.980 --> 10:51.940]  I find myself hitting the thermal banger more than anything. Uh,
[10:51.980 --> 10:55.260]  the turps spinners, they're cool. They're novel.
[10:55.700 --> 10:59.260]  Uh, it didn't make a whole lot of difference. The insert is cool,
[10:59.260 --> 11:01.540]  but you got to let it cool after you hit it.
[11:01.540 --> 11:04.460]  And then you got to pull that insert out and then you got to clean that.
[11:04.460 --> 11:05.820]  And then you got to load up another dab.
[11:06.140 --> 11:09.540]  It's fun and it's a cool process if you're dabbing by yourself and you don't have
[11:09.540 --> 11:12.780]  a buddy sitting across the table going, so can I get a dab also broke?
[11:12.780 --> 11:15.380]  Cause I just watched you take one and you've been cleaning shit for the next four
[11:15.400 --> 11:17.260]  minutes. So, uh,
[11:17.340 --> 11:20.580]  insert dabs are cool for like if there's one or two of you hanging out and Mike's
[11:20.580 --> 11:22.260]  patient and not in a hurry for a dab.
[11:22.660 --> 11:24.940]  But if you're dabbing with like three or four people and you got to get the rig
[11:24.940 --> 11:26.780]  around the room and everybody wants to get stoned,
[11:26.820 --> 11:31.060]  a normal banger style nail is probably the better way to go for you.
[11:31.060 --> 11:33.660]  If you've got a lot of people, you might want to bust out a couple of rigs.
[11:33.660 --> 11:35.220]  You might want to get an email set up.
[11:35.260 --> 11:39.180]  But if we're going to compare the turps spinners to the insert,
[11:39.300 --> 11:43.020]  I would prefer the insert all day. But for me,
[11:43.060 --> 11:47.700]  the insert is too much maintenance for a group or on the go. All right.
[11:47.700 --> 11:50.780]  I tried to keep that short. I hope that was short enough for you. Once again,
[11:50.780 --> 11:53.660]  a big shout out to my friends at happy daddy for the wonderful care package.
[11:53.660 --> 11:58.540]  I do appreciate that. Now let's move this podcast forward.
[11:58.540 --> 12:03.540]  I'm going to read a comment that I got from a grower friend and it goes like
[12:03.580 --> 12:07.420]  this. You have the most entertaining cannabis podcast by far.
[12:07.660 --> 12:09.820]  I've got a question for you. Hey, first off, uh,
[12:09.840 --> 12:12.500]  thanks for enjoying my podcast and thanks for the great compliment.
[12:12.540 --> 12:15.060]  And thanks for this message. Then the question says,
[12:15.060 --> 12:19.260]  it's my first time making seeds and my plants are on the same flowering period.
[12:19.460 --> 12:20.420]  They are outdoors.
[12:20.860 --> 12:24.500]  Will this be an issue that the females are getting pollen later in the
[12:24.500 --> 12:28.500]  flowering period? I know this is how nature intended it, but I've read,
[12:28.580 --> 12:31.340]  they need pollen earlier than that.
[12:31.900 --> 12:36.260]  So this guy's got an outdoor crop that he intends on making seeds.
[12:36.260 --> 12:38.780]  He's got a male out there and probably multiple females.
[12:39.020 --> 12:41.980]  He's going to flower them out using the natural cycle of the sun.
[12:42.340 --> 12:45.140]  Then that male is going to dump pollen on his girls and he's going to have
[12:45.140 --> 12:50.140]  seeds. His concern is that the male and female aren't going to time up because
[12:50.340 --> 12:54.100]  when a lot of breeders talk about timing and pollination in an indoor
[12:54.100 --> 12:57.740]  environment, we'd like to get the male a little bit ahead of the girls.
[12:57.980 --> 13:01.380]  We'd like to put him in the room and get his pollen started and then we keep him
[13:01.380 --> 13:04.380]  separate. And then we get the girls in the room and each girl,
[13:04.380 --> 13:08.020]  each female plant likes to be pollinated at a different time.
[13:08.260 --> 13:09.340]  My lemon skunk plant,
[13:09.340 --> 13:13.100]  you've got to wait a little later in the flowering phase to pollinate her than
[13:13.100 --> 13:16.420]  the platinum tangy. Platinum tangy wants pollen really early.
[13:16.620 --> 13:18.500]  Lemon skunk wants pollen really late.
[13:18.780 --> 13:23.420]  So I would put the lemon skunk in the room seven to 10 days before the platinum
[13:23.420 --> 13:25.220]  tangy throw that platinum tangy in there,
[13:25.420 --> 13:28.140]  get them both caught up to where they're both at their prime time for
[13:28.140 --> 13:30.700]  pollination. Then I've already got that boy in there.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.500]  He's been dumping pollen for a little while.
[13:32.500 --> 13:35.460]  He's in this peak pollination time. Now he's got a lot of pollen,
[13:35.460 --> 13:36.500]  just falling off of him.
[13:36.500 --> 13:39.580]  That's when I would go drag him across the room and shake the shit out of him
[13:39.860 --> 13:41.980]  and all of his pollen would go over those girls,
[13:42.220 --> 13:46.020]  which are both at their peak ovulation time. Indoors,
[13:46.020 --> 13:47.100]  it's a little more critical.
[13:47.940 --> 13:50.580]  I think you've got the right idea when you said, uh,
[13:50.620 --> 13:52.340]  I know this is how nature intended it,
[13:52.420 --> 13:55.580]  but I've read that they need pollen earlier than that.
[13:55.620 --> 14:00.260]  Now your boy plant is going to be dumping pollen outside in plenty of time for
[14:00.260 --> 14:03.300]  your girls to receive pollen. If anything,
[14:03.700 --> 14:07.660]  that boy is going to start dumping pollen a little bit too early and you're not
[14:07.660 --> 14:10.220]  going to want to get the pollen on those girls. Like I said,
[14:10.420 --> 14:12.260]  until that peak ovulation time,
[14:12.980 --> 14:17.020]  your male plant is going to start putting out pollen early in the flowering
[14:17.060 --> 14:19.900]  cycle indoors. It would be around day 14 outdoors.
[14:20.100 --> 14:24.020]  It's hard to predict because I don't know what strain you're growing.
[14:24.180 --> 14:26.740]  I don't know where it came from. I don't know if it was indoors and brought
[14:26.780 --> 14:28.980]  outdoors. I don't know if it's in a pot and it's root bound.
[14:28.980 --> 14:30.180]  I don't know its conditions,
[14:30.500 --> 14:35.100]  but that plant's going to start dropping pollen around maybe 12 days,
[14:35.220 --> 14:37.700]  14 days, 17 days into flower.
[14:37.980 --> 14:42.900]  Those girls aren't going to be ready for pollen until about day 23, 25,
[14:43.220 --> 14:45.380]  maybe 27 for some of those plants.
[14:45.700 --> 14:48.660]  Lemon skunk doesn't want pollen until closer to day 32.
[14:48.860 --> 14:50.220]  The lemon skunk that I've got,
[14:50.500 --> 14:54.460]  I have no idea what girls or males you have got in there or out there.
[14:54.500 --> 14:55.340]  This is an outdoor grow.
[14:55.340 --> 14:58.900]  I don't have any idea what genetics you're working with and I don't know their
[14:58.940 --> 15:00.340]  condition when you put them out.
[15:00.340 --> 15:04.620]  So I don't know how soon your boy is going to start dropping pollen. Honestly,
[15:04.980 --> 15:08.620]  it'll be somewhere around between day 12 and 14 or 17.
[15:08.620 --> 15:12.100]  The pollen will start coming out. Like I said, those girls aren't ready by then.
[15:12.300 --> 15:16.900]  So the trick would be keeping the pollen off of those girls until they're nice
[15:17.020 --> 15:20.020]  and fluffy. When they start looking like dandelions, when they're coated,
[15:20.260 --> 15:23.340]  and you guys call them the white hairs, those hairs are what received the pollen.
[15:23.820 --> 15:24.820]  Those hairs are pistils.
[15:24.820 --> 15:28.340]  Those pistils catch the pollen or the pollen lands on there and it slides down
[15:28.340 --> 15:30.060]  that pistil and it goes into the ovule.
[15:30.060 --> 15:33.540]  That ovule starts producing a seed and fills that calyx spot up with the seed.
[15:34.140 --> 15:38.380]  So my point is the more of those fluffy hairs, those pistils you have available,
[15:38.380 --> 15:41.500]  the more seed production you can get off of your plant.
[15:41.500 --> 15:44.860]  So in a perfect world, we would time up our plants.
[15:44.860 --> 15:47.580]  We would keep the male way over there. We would keep the girl way over there.
[15:47.580 --> 15:48.820]  We would keep the other girl way over there.
[15:48.820 --> 15:50.820]  And when it was time we would bring them all into the same room,
[15:51.020 --> 15:55.260]  we'd match them all up and we would do the deed, but we can't do that outdoors.
[15:55.580 --> 15:59.180]  So you're right. Nature is going to make it happen just like it should.
[15:59.180 --> 16:03.140]  These plants have been surviving and reproducing on their own for a long time.
[16:03.140 --> 16:06.180]  But the trick there is that those were probably land races.
[16:06.300 --> 16:08.900]  So it was the same strain. It was the same cross.
[16:08.900 --> 16:12.140]  It was the same male and same girl and they were pollinating each other and
[16:12.140 --> 16:15.340]  dropping seeds. And it was just different F generations every year.
[16:16.340 --> 16:18.660]  Now your plants are not in the perfect world.
[16:18.660 --> 16:21.180]  You're not in an indoor environment where you can time everything.
[16:21.700 --> 16:24.940]  You are going to make plenty of seeds. Trust me.
[16:25.140 --> 16:27.980]  It doesn't take much pollen to make a lot of seed,
[16:28.500 --> 16:31.940]  especially in an outdoor environment. This is what the plants want to do.
[16:32.700 --> 16:35.980]  If you're just trying to make seeds for yourself, you're going to be overwhelmed.
[16:35.980 --> 16:39.980]  You're going to be amazed with how many seeds you produce in one small seed run
[16:40.180 --> 16:45.060]  from some outdoor plants. So the short version of my answer is just let it happen
[16:45.060 --> 16:48.340]  naturally and everything will be fine. If you can keep that pollen,
[16:48.340 --> 16:52.380]  if you can keep that male plant from being disturbed too much, try that,
[16:52.380 --> 16:55.540]  but it's outdoors, wind, animals, bugs,
[16:55.780 --> 16:57.500]  all kinds of shit's going to disrupt your goal.
[16:57.580 --> 17:01.460]  So let it happen naturally and everything should be just fine.
[17:01.620 --> 17:03.860]  One thing I will recommend when I am making seeds,
[17:03.860 --> 17:05.620]  when I am purposefully seeding a crop,
[17:06.060 --> 17:10.940]  I increase the amount of amino acids I feed my plants. They want more aminos.
[17:11.380 --> 17:13.620]  So if you're not already adding an amino product,
[17:13.620 --> 17:18.260]  you may want to consider adding something with amino acids to your lineup right
[17:18.260 --> 17:22.740]  at the beginning of flowering and through the seed production phase of your
[17:22.740 --> 17:27.060]  breeding program. Now you said this is your first attempt at breeding.
[17:27.460 --> 17:31.180]  I am going to give some breeding advice and guidance.
[17:32.060 --> 17:33.180]  When those seeds are done,
[17:33.620 --> 17:36.460]  keep them all separated so that you know what you've got, right? Obviously,
[17:36.460 --> 17:37.820]  hopefully you're that far ahead of the game.
[17:37.820 --> 17:41.140]  You know to keep plant A with seed A and plant B with seeds B,
[17:41.380 --> 17:44.980]  and you got a plant labeled or a jar labeled seeds from plant A and a jar
[17:44.980 --> 17:47.380]  labeled, and you've got the cross written down and you know what you've got.
[17:47.380 --> 17:52.300]  So now it is your job to grow those seeds out yourself before they
[17:52.300 --> 17:53.140]  go anywhere.
[17:53.380 --> 17:58.460]  Either you or somebody that you know and trust and they have
[17:58.460 --> 18:00.540]  been told these are test beans.
[18:00.540 --> 18:02.020]  I don't know what they're going to do.
[18:02.500 --> 18:06.500]  You're putting something in somebody's hand that is going to cost them money.
[18:06.740 --> 18:10.860]  They have to pay first off for dirt. The seeds have to go into some dirt.
[18:11.220 --> 18:13.140]  They have to pay for pots to put the dirt in.
[18:13.460 --> 18:16.580]  Then they've got to pay for lights to run the plants under.
[18:16.900 --> 18:19.260]  Then they've got to pay for nutrients to feed these plants.
[18:20.380 --> 18:25.180]  Don't give these seeds to somebody who really needs a crop of medicine to
[18:25.180 --> 18:29.340]  survive that doesn't understand they've got a test crop. You've got to say,
[18:29.500 --> 18:32.380]  these could all be mutants. These could all be hermaphrodites.
[18:32.660 --> 18:37.500]  This could all be shit. Sometimes when you breed, it doesn't work out.
[18:38.220 --> 18:41.380]  There are ugly people. There are ugly dogs. There are ugly animals.
[18:41.620 --> 18:45.340]  Sometimes when you breed, you make some ugly shit. It's just how things go.
[18:46.020 --> 18:46.860]  As a breeder,
[18:47.540 --> 18:52.260]  it is your responsibility to make sure you are improving cannabis
[18:52.420 --> 18:56.860]  and not fucking it up by putting out a bunch of seeds that are going to take us
[18:56.900 --> 19:01.420]  backwards in the evolution of cannabis. We want to improve.
[19:01.740 --> 19:05.500]  If your offspring is not better than the plant you started with,
[19:05.740 --> 19:10.740]  you were not doing any justice unless you have isolated a specific trait you
[19:10.740 --> 19:14.700]  were looking for and you wrote down in the beginning and predicted it,
[19:14.980 --> 19:17.540]  not just said, Hey, that happened. That's something I was looking for.
[19:17.940 --> 19:22.380]  So it is your responsibility to let the grower know what you're giving them.
[19:22.660 --> 19:26.980]  It is also your responsibility to grow those seeds out before you market them
[19:26.980 --> 19:29.860]  and make sure you have got a quality product.
[19:30.100 --> 19:32.220]  Don't put some hermaphrodites out for the world.
[19:32.420 --> 19:35.980]  Don't put some bullshit out for the world. Test it yourself. Like I said,
[19:35.980 --> 19:37.660]  if it's not better than the parent,
[19:37.700 --> 19:42.580]  it's not worth putting out unless you have isolated a trait and improved on that
[19:42.580 --> 19:46.980]  trait or stabilize something or corrected a problem within that plant.
[19:46.980 --> 19:50.140]  But if you had a problematic plant, why were you breeding it anyway?
[19:50.420 --> 19:53.060]  Unless you knew that you wanted to fix it.
[19:53.860 --> 19:55.420]  So now you've got a bunch of brand new seeds.
[19:55.420 --> 19:58.180]  Now you've got to grow them out yourself. You've got to pay attention to them.
[19:58.180 --> 20:00.980]  You've got to take notes. You've got to take pictures.
[20:00.980 --> 20:02.020]  You've got to keep a journal.
[20:02.300 --> 20:05.140]  You've got to see if what you have produced is worth a shit.
[20:05.740 --> 20:09.780]  Once you've ran plenty of these seeds to make sure you've got something that
[20:09.780 --> 20:13.740]  doesn't hermaphrodite on you and that isn't just fucking bullshit altogether,
[20:13.980 --> 20:17.260]  then you've got to stress test it. You got to beat the shit out of the plants.
[20:17.580 --> 20:21.580]  You've got to take a few and put them in a room and mess up the light cycle and
[20:21.580 --> 20:22.780]  see if they flip out on you.
[20:22.980 --> 20:26.860]  Take a few other plants and put them in a room and feed them way too hard.
[20:27.060 --> 20:29.220]  See what they do. Take a few more plants,
[20:29.220 --> 20:32.380]  put them in another room and mess with the humidity real bad or make it too
[20:32.380 --> 20:35.380]  cold. Just piss the plants off. See how they react.
[20:35.660 --> 20:37.740]  Take some of your plants and put them in a room.
[20:38.100 --> 20:40.700]  We all know this one guy that grows, he gets powdery mildew.
[20:40.700 --> 20:42.620]  Every time he grows, he's always complaining about it.
[20:42.620 --> 20:46.060]  Always happens around the end of August because it started getting real moist
[20:46.060 --> 20:49.500]  here. It starts getting cold. Things just go. We know every year,
[20:49.500 --> 20:52.860]  we've all got friends that complain about powdery mildew. Give a clone to that guy.
[20:53.060 --> 20:55.180]  See if he gets powdery mildew on it purposefully.
[20:55.300 --> 20:57.740]  Be like go put this in that fucked up corner in your room.
[20:57.740 --> 21:00.220]  That's always got PM and see if this grows in there.
[21:00.700 --> 21:02.580]  If you've got a friend that's always getting spider mites,
[21:02.580 --> 21:05.180]  we all know that guy that's always got fucking mites. Go take,
[21:05.380 --> 21:08.220]  give him a couple of these clones. See how the mites react to this plant.
[21:08.540 --> 21:11.020]  Go in his room. See if there, well maybe don't go in there.
[21:11.060 --> 21:13.380]  Don't go get his bugs. You have him report back.
[21:13.580 --> 21:14.740]  Go in there and look and see,
[21:14.940 --> 21:17.060]  are there a bunch of mites on the plants all around it?
[21:17.060 --> 21:21.340]  And this one has 50% as many mites, 20% as many mites.
[21:21.540 --> 21:26.540]  Anything quantifiable. Is it quantifiable? Quantitative, cumulative,
[21:27.020 --> 21:28.540]  qualitative. Anyway,
[21:28.740 --> 21:31.260]  anything that you can fucking see with your eyes and write down with your pen,
[21:31.260 --> 21:32.860]  or you could text me and you could say, bro,
[21:33.140 --> 21:36.100]  these plants you gave me are way covered in mites and the other ones aren't.
[21:36.100 --> 21:36.900]  Or you could say, bro,
[21:36.900 --> 21:40.020]  these plants don't have any mites and all the other plants are coded.
[21:40.340 --> 21:43.260]  Things like that. Find that stuff out. Test your plants out.
[21:43.260 --> 21:47.420]  See what you've got. Then spread them out to the world. If they're good.
[21:47.540 --> 21:50.700]  If not keep them to yourself and keep playing with them. Try to F2 it.
[21:50.700 --> 21:51.580]  Try to BX it.
[21:52.220 --> 21:55.980]  Maybe select another male and rebreed that male to everything else all over
[21:55.980 --> 21:59.260]  again. If you're breeding outdoors, you only get one shot every year at it.
[21:59.460 --> 22:03.180]  Hopefully you've got an indoor grow that you can grow these out in to play with
[22:03.180 --> 22:04.340]  throughout the rest of the year.
[22:04.580 --> 22:06.540]  And then you can figure out what you're really working with.
[22:07.140 --> 22:09.500]  If you don't have the ability to grow a bunch out,
[22:09.500 --> 22:12.380]  maybe pass them out to some friends, but make sure those friends know,
[22:12.420 --> 22:15.420]  like I said, that these are tester beans. Cause you want to grow a lot.
[22:15.420 --> 22:18.820]  You want to grow large populations. That's when you see the truth.
[22:18.860 --> 22:20.500]  That's when you see what's really going on.
[22:20.500 --> 22:22.100]  That's when you start seeing the outliers.
[22:22.660 --> 22:25.580]  I've been putting out a rise seeds for several years now.
[22:26.100 --> 22:29.540]  And for a long time I saw a lot of very similar things.
[22:29.980 --> 22:32.860]  And now occasionally I'll get a picture. Somebody will be like,
[22:32.860 --> 22:34.020]  look what I found bro.
[22:34.340 --> 22:38.100]  And it's because I've put out so many seeds of the arise that I'm starting to
[22:38.100 --> 22:42.140]  see outliers. We're getting 35% THCA outliers.
[22:42.140 --> 22:44.460]  We're getting crazy yielding outliers.
[22:44.460 --> 22:48.700]  We're getting some that have purple and smell like a fucking can of tennis
[22:48.700 --> 22:49.980]  balls and burnt rubber.
[22:50.300 --> 22:53.460]  I'm finding new things because so many of them have been put out now.
[22:53.460 --> 22:55.340]  They're not common. We don't see it a lot.
[22:55.580 --> 22:59.460]  It's usually that one that looks like a golden goat plant with golden goat
[22:59.460 --> 23:00.740]  leaves and a cushy structure.
[23:00.740 --> 23:03.020]  It's usually that thing that we see a lot with the rise,
[23:03.020 --> 23:06.060]  but now that it's out there, I'm starting to see these outliers.
[23:06.900 --> 23:10.460]  So I could rant on this forever, obviously, but my point is grow a lot,
[23:10.460 --> 23:13.940]  grow as many as you can. Of course, follow your state laws, be legal.
[23:13.940 --> 23:16.380]  Don't break any rules. I cannot condone or, uh,
[23:16.780 --> 23:20.580]  can encourage you to break the law, but you know, grow as many as you can, uh,
[23:20.620 --> 23:22.860]  cram a bunch in there, fill the trays, fill the tables,
[23:23.100 --> 23:24.900]  grow a bunch of little plants, see what you've got.
[23:24.900 --> 23:26.220]  You don't have to grow gigantic plants.
[23:26.220 --> 23:30.180]  If you just want to see what you've got, grow some little ones, you'll know, uh,
[23:30.220 --> 23:31.740]  grow them in six inch net pots.
[23:31.820 --> 23:36.260]  You can fit a lot of those under a 400 watt light, grow them till they're tiny,
[23:36.420 --> 23:39.460]  flip them, let them flower out. If they're at Herms,
[23:39.580 --> 23:42.260]  you're going to know pretty quickly. You'll know within three, maybe four weeks.
[23:42.260 --> 23:44.140]  Sometimes they got it. You got to wait till five or six weeks,
[23:44.140 --> 23:46.500]  but some will show you right away. They'll go back and they'll just be like,
[23:46.540 --> 23:48.380]  Oh, I got to throw these away. Some of them,
[23:48.620 --> 23:51.220]  you're going to be able to tell these aren't worth a shit. Some, you're going to go,
[23:51.220 --> 23:52.780]  Oh, I'm so glad I bred this.
[23:52.780 --> 23:55.500]  And then you're going to have a bag full of those seeds to play with.
[23:55.740 --> 23:58.340]  So grow as many as you can. That's my point.
[23:58.380 --> 24:00.820]  That's when you're going to see what you've really created.
[24:01.180 --> 24:03.180]  Then here's the hard part.
[24:03.660 --> 24:07.380]  If you have created something that just sucks,
[24:08.380 --> 24:11.340]  you can throw those seeds away or you can give them away,
[24:11.340 --> 24:13.620]  but make sure you tell your friends like these aren't very cool.
[24:13.620 --> 24:15.860]  I'd rather you just throw them away or feed them to a bird.
[24:16.140 --> 24:17.660]  Or if you've got some kind of pet or something,
[24:17.660 --> 24:19.700]  just mix them in with some bird feed or some shit,
[24:19.700 --> 24:20.940]  sprinkle them out in the yard,
[24:21.420 --> 24:24.060]  or maybe you can find some creative place to sprinkle them,
[24:24.380 --> 24:28.500]  but don't pass them along for other people to grow thinking that they're going to
[24:28.500 --> 24:30.340]  grow high quality medicine.
[24:30.340 --> 24:33.540]  When all you've really given them is some swag weed seeds.
[24:33.980 --> 24:37.100]  We need to set people up for success. We need to do that groundwork,
[24:37.100 --> 24:40.260]  that legwork to find out what we've got to find out if it's worth a shit.
[24:40.780 --> 24:42.820]  Even if you're giving it to somebody, like I said earlier,
[24:42.820 --> 24:45.460]  it costs them money and they are expecting an outcome.
[24:45.740 --> 24:49.060]  You're giving them seeds and they're going to take their trust in you.
[24:49.060 --> 24:51.020]  You created something. They're going to trust you.
[24:51.260 --> 24:53.860]  That's like the mechanic putting your fucking tire on or the mechanic doing
[24:53.860 --> 24:56.260]  something to your car that could go totally wrong while you're flying on the
[24:56.260 --> 25:00.220]  highway. Now, Will comes off, you're fucked. You trust that guy a lot.
[25:00.700 --> 25:04.500]  That's how much they're trusting you. This crop could cost them a lot.
[25:04.740 --> 25:08.700]  In some places, this crop could cost them their freedom.
[25:08.860 --> 25:12.700]  And they're growing our, our seeds, the seeds we made in these gardens.
[25:12.780 --> 25:14.140]  They're trusting us. They're going to say,
[25:14.380 --> 25:18.060]  Rasta Jeff put a lot of love and research and care into these seeds.
[25:18.060 --> 25:20.820]  I trust that this is going to be a usable product in the end.
[25:21.180 --> 25:24.180]  And they're going to put that into dirt. There's money. They're going to put,
[25:24.180 --> 25:28.020]  they got seeds. That was money. First off money, seeds, then dirt,
[25:28.060 --> 25:29.660]  then a container to put the dirt in,
[25:29.940 --> 25:34.660]  then lights to run fucking plants under then nutrients.
[25:35.140 --> 25:39.100]  Then all of the time it takes your personal energy. You've got to run a fan.
[25:39.100 --> 25:41.780]  You've got to run a carbon filter. You're investing a lot of things.
[25:42.100 --> 25:45.300]  Let's give people something that will turn out in the end.
[25:45.300 --> 25:47.700]  Let's not give them a time bomb to waste a bunch of money on.
[25:47.700 --> 25:49.580]  They need a reward in the end.
[25:50.500 --> 25:54.100]  So if you've bred some shit and you grew a bunch of it and you don't see
[25:54.100 --> 25:55.300]  anything that impresses you,
[25:55.900 --> 25:58.780]  don't let your ego get in the way of you just throwing those seeds away.
[25:59.700 --> 26:03.300]  You bred several crosses. So hopefully the other ones make up for it.
[26:03.300 --> 26:05.780]  You don't have to talk about that one. You threw away that disappeared.
[26:05.780 --> 26:07.020]  That's gone. What happened to those seeds?
[26:07.060 --> 26:10.540]  They all sucked and I flushed them or they all sucked and I fed them to crazy.
[26:10.540 --> 26:14.180]  Larry's parrot, you know, whatever. Uh, don't just don't put those out.
[26:14.540 --> 26:17.860]  Or if you want to, maybe you can F to it and see if you can fix it.
[26:18.100 --> 26:21.740]  But that's kind of a waste of time when you've got other quality genetics to
[26:21.740 --> 26:24.740]  play with, then focus on the good ones. Focus on the positive,
[26:25.100 --> 26:28.740]  focus on the good shit that you made with all of the quality genetics we're
[26:28.740 --> 26:30.580]  playing with now duds are uncommon,
[26:30.620 --> 26:34.580]  but there is always going to be the chance that something just doesn't work.
[26:34.660 --> 26:38.060]  People have been breeding for a long time and we still have people born with
[26:38.220 --> 26:43.100]  anomalies. So that goes for any type of breeding plants, animals,
[26:43.140 --> 26:47.660]  anything where there's genetics being crossed, things can go awry.
[26:48.540 --> 26:52.380]  All right. I think that was enough ranting on one subject for one podcast.
[26:52.380 --> 26:54.860]  I want to thank you for the great message that came in on Instagram.
