[02:23.060 --> 02:25.600]  Don't worry. I do have a lot of new stuff coming soon
[02:25.600 --> 02:29.800]  I need to take a moment to update the inventory update pricing add some new things
[02:29.800 --> 02:34.480]  Then we will do some new drops and add some new things to I read direct
[02:34.920 --> 02:40.840]  Calm the best way to stay updated on what is coming to I read direct calm is to join the newsletter on
[02:40.880 --> 02:43.760]  I read genetics calm. I know that's a lot to handle
[02:43.760 --> 02:44.520]  There are two websites
[02:44.520 --> 02:45.640]  But there are reasons to that
[02:45.640 --> 02:51.660]  Go to I read genetics calm sign up for the newsletter there if you scroll almost all the way to the bottom of the page
[02:51.660 --> 02:55.800]  At I read genetics calm. You'll see a tab that says stay updated or stay in touch
[02:55.800 --> 02:58.520]  I don't remember exactly what it says. I've looked just a minute ago
[02:58.520 --> 03:03.960]  I cannot remember what it says. I think it says stay in touch or stay updated type in your email address right there
[03:03.960 --> 03:08.920]  That will add you to my mailing list that way every time I do a sale a new drop an exclusive deal
[03:09.120 --> 03:14.360]  Something fancy an event comes up. Maybe I'm gonna be somewhere. I will let you know through that newsletter
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.000]  So go to I read genetics calm scroll most of the way down. You'll see the tab
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.480]  It's fairly obvious type in your email address sign up for that newsletter
[03:22.480 --> 03:26.080]  I did mention that I was going to be putting new things on I read direct
[03:26.080 --> 03:30.480]  I'm also going to be doing testing a little bit differently here in the next year
[03:30.760 --> 03:34.520]  Before I've been taking tester applications through emails and through the discord
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.840]  I'm not going to be doing as much of that if you've sent an application to be a tester
[03:38.840 --> 03:41.480]  Those are still in the running those will still be considered
[03:41.480 --> 03:44.760]  I do go through those randomly when I have some time and pick out some folks
[03:45.120 --> 03:49.280]  But I do have a strategy of how I want to do the testers in the upcoming year
[03:49.280 --> 03:52.540]  My new plan is to do two testers every month
[03:52.540 --> 03:56.900]  I would like to do one regular and one feminized cross every month so far
[03:56.900 --> 04:02.300]  I've got a few months of test seeds planned out and prepared from previous harvest from summer runs and things like that
[04:02.300 --> 04:06.900]  I've got a lot of seed stockpiled that you guys have never seen never heard of I want to get those out and get those
[04:06.900 --> 04:13.860]  In testing so I'd like to do one feminized and one regular strain for testing every month for the next six to eight
[04:13.860 --> 04:18.780]  Hopefully even maybe up to the next 12 months. So that means every month we'll have two new testers
[04:19.060 --> 04:23.660]  Some of those will not make it some of those will make it but you guys will get to see most of the testing that
[04:23.660 --> 04:25.580]  Goes on for the next year
[04:25.580 --> 04:29.660]  So I'll be putting out two testers every month for the next year
[04:29.780 --> 04:35.700]  These new testers will be released in limited batches and they will be available in a couple of different ways
[04:35.700 --> 04:39.820]  A lot of them will be given away with orders on I redirect
[04:39.820 --> 04:42.420]  So if you order from I redirect every month
[04:42.420 --> 04:46.220]  You've got the opportunity to get one or two new tester packs from me
[04:46.220 --> 04:50.620]  Everybody gets freebies when you order on I redirect part of those freebies will be free
[04:50.900 --> 04:53.820]  Tester packs a lot of people love getting that brand new stuff
[04:54.060 --> 04:58.200]  You've got something nobody else has because you've got it before everybody because you are a tester
[04:58.200 --> 05:02.280]  You may have the next big winner. You may have the next champion from my line
[05:02.280 --> 05:05.900]  you may get to test grow it before everybody else if you were growing for a
[05:06.740 --> 05:11.380]  Profitable gain that may set you apart from the rest of the market that may really help you out
[05:11.840 --> 05:15.180]  So they will be going out as freebies on I redirect
[05:15.300 --> 05:21.020]  I will also add them to I redirect for a very low price. I'll be putting I've been doing it
[05:21.020 --> 05:24.620]  I've been putting Big Mountain fudge cake testers on the website. They went very well
[05:24.620 --> 05:29.140]  I put the testers clearly labeled that they are testers. I put them at a very reasonable price
[05:29.380 --> 05:34.660]  There's a little note attached to the package that lets you know what you can expect lets you know what I expect
[05:34.660 --> 05:39.860]  There's a link to the discord that way you can sign up to our discord and post all of your tester photos and information
[05:39.940 --> 05:44.380]  To the discord tester tab. So there are two ways to get the new tester seeds
[05:44.380 --> 05:49.500]  They will be coming as freebies from orders on I redirect and also I may add some of them
[05:49.620 --> 05:55.500]  Randomly to the I redirect website for a very limited price. And again, those will be at very limited
[05:56.180 --> 06:00.660]  Quantities if you have tested for me in the past don't feel like you're going to get left out
[06:00.660 --> 06:04.940]  I've got a list of testers. I see your pictures. I see your names in my computer in my phone
[06:05.060 --> 06:06.820]  Don't worry. You will not get left out
[06:06.820 --> 06:11.640]  I do consider you for testing in the future if you've already been testing and you want more tester seeds
[06:11.720 --> 06:15.360]  Reach out either via email or on discord. Let me know say hey, bro
[06:15.360 --> 06:20.080]  I finished up the last run of testers here the pictures really love to run a new batch for you
[06:20.080 --> 06:23.360]  I like repeat offenders if you come back and test for me again
[06:23.360 --> 06:26.840]  That means that you understood the assignment the first time you probably did a good job
[06:26.840 --> 06:31.220]  I'll probably give you seeds again and we'll keep it going. We'll keep your garden fresh. Keep it new
[06:31.260 --> 06:35.420]  Keep my photos keep my data coming. We'll work out together very well like that
[06:35.420 --> 06:40.320]  So so don't feel like you're going to get left behind or pushed out or forgotten if you've been testing for me before
[06:40.320 --> 06:44.900]  I just want to establish new relationships with new testers because if you haven't noticed
[06:44.900 --> 06:49.040]  I've been making a lot of seeds and I need to get them out there and I'd like to get them thoroughly
[06:49.140 --> 06:52.200]  Tested so we can get them to the people who need to grow them
[06:52.200 --> 06:54.300]  I know I mentioned this just a moment ago
[06:54.300 --> 06:56.300]  But if you do get tester seeds
[06:56.340 --> 07:01.580]  Please join the discord and post photos of those tester seeds in the IRI genetics tester tab
[07:01.580 --> 07:06.380]  If you're on the discord on the left side, if you scroll down on the IRI genetics discord
[07:06.380 --> 07:10.500]  There are a bunch of tabs different places to go. There's one that says testers click on there
[07:10.500 --> 07:14.820]  You can post your pictures. You can post data. You can scroll up and see what other people are posting
[07:14.820 --> 07:18.980]  You can either follow the kind of guideline or you can set the standard and create new trends
[07:19.080 --> 07:24.060]  Post any of the information you think I might want to know how long you grew it how many of the plants germinated?
[07:24.140 --> 07:26.900]  How long you flowered it for if you noticed anything weird?
[07:27.040 --> 07:33.820]  Let me know any details you think may be interesting to myself or other people growing that strain in the future
[07:33.820 --> 07:39.540]  Alright, I think that covers testers you guys let's move forward to the main chunk of this podcast
[07:39.540 --> 07:41.860]  Of course, we are entering a brand new year here
[07:41.860 --> 07:45.980]  A lot of people like that new year new me new year new start sort of stuff
[07:46.000 --> 07:52.740]  Why not use this new calendar year as a new goal setting phase a new time phase to start fresh and get things going start
[07:52.940 --> 07:54.780]  Documenting doing things properly
[07:54.780 --> 08:00.900]  Let's jump into it and talk a little bit more about creating a good start and a good strategy for a brand new year
[08:01.020 --> 08:02.460]  In my opinion
[08:02.460 --> 08:06.920]  Everything goes better with a good strategy with a good plan with a good expected outcome
[08:07.220 --> 08:12.340]  With sort of a plan of what could go wrong what to look for and how to react to those things as it happens
[08:12.340 --> 08:18.680]  If you go into things blindly, you didn't have no idea how that shit is going to turn out not just in growing
[08:18.680 --> 08:23.940]  But almost everything in life works that way the better you prepare the more you plan the better it's gonna go
[08:23.940 --> 08:27.560]  Of course, you got to be spontaneous and have some fun the grow works that way too
[08:27.560 --> 08:32.040]  But if we've got a strategy got an idea have a an expected goal written down
[08:32.040 --> 08:36.240]  It is easier to reflect on things and see where we are with our progress
[08:36.800 --> 08:41.200]  So my question to you is do you have a goal for your grow this year?
[08:41.200 --> 08:44.520]  Is there something you want to improve on is there something you want to work on?
[08:44.600 --> 08:49.320]  Let's talk about a few goals that you could have in your grow room for this year
[08:49.400 --> 08:52.520]  Maybe the first thing I would do is identify the weak spot
[08:52.520 --> 08:57.680]  What are you not good at in the grow room for a long time? My weak spot was cloning
[08:57.680 --> 08:59.800]  I told one of my friends I said hey, bro
[08:59.800 --> 09:04.800]  I really suck at cloning and he I've done a full podcast about this and he came over and he showed me step-by-step
[09:04.840 --> 09:08.920]  How to make clones guess what now my clone game is on top of shit
[09:09.120 --> 09:12.480]  Figure out what your weakness is find out where you're lacking in the grow
[09:12.520 --> 09:17.560]  Let's identify that and let's make that your strongest part of the grow the next time
[09:17.560 --> 09:20.560]  We'll identify the next weakness and we'll make that the strongest part
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.560]  We'll just keep leapfrogging your weaknesses into your strongest points in the grow. So let's identify the weakness
[09:26.560 --> 09:31.440]  Maybe you're not good at cloning. Maybe you're really not good at lollipopping. Maybe you don't know how to pop and twist
[09:31.440 --> 09:33.200]  Maybe you're no good at working a trellis
[09:33.200 --> 09:36.440]  Maybe there's things that you need to work on in the grow that I'm not even aware of
[09:36.760 --> 09:40.960]  So identify your biggest weakness in the grow. Maybe you're not good at taking clones
[09:40.960 --> 09:44.460]  Maybe you're not good at popping and twisting. Maybe you're not good at lollipopping
[09:44.520 --> 09:48.960]  Maybe you've never topped a plant because you're afraid maybe you don't know how to work a trellis or a scrog
[09:49.600 --> 09:53.360]  Identify your weakness and let's fix that right here at the start of the year
[09:53.360 --> 09:55.840]  Let's make that one of the first projects that we correct
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.600]  Some of the things we do in the grow are more measurable than others the amount of effort we put in the amount of time
[10:01.600 --> 10:06.880]  We spend in there the amount of work we do that's only measurable by hours and actually by the outcome
[10:06.920 --> 10:11.960]  Things that we can actually measure though are how much product did you produce last year?
[10:11.960 --> 10:13.960]  Do you know how much herb you produced in the last?
[10:14.760 --> 10:22.000]  365 days. Are you a flower grower? How much usable smokable flower? Did you produce? Are you a concentrate maker?
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.960]  How much usable smokable concentrate did you produce then the next question? What happened to all that?
[10:27.960 --> 10:31.760]  Do you have something to show for it? Did you smoke all of it, which is just fine
[10:31.760 --> 10:33.160]  You grew it to consume it
[10:33.160 --> 10:39.320]  But if you are somebody who is making a profit or providing a product to somebody what happened to that product is was their income?
[10:39.320 --> 10:42.960]  Made from that product what happened to that money? Did that go somewhere?
[10:42.960 --> 10:47.000]  Did you put that in the bank? Did you buy sneakers with it? Are you living off a part of it?
[10:47.000 --> 10:50.000]  Did you invest part of it into the grow? Where did that money go?
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.840]  So the first question how much product did you produce in the last year?
[10:53.840 --> 10:59.120]  Like I said, if you're a flower producer how much flower if you're a concentrate maker how much concentrate did you produce?
[10:59.400 --> 11:04.320]  Then where did that go? Did you smoke it? Did you move it? Then where did the money go now?
[11:04.320 --> 11:09.800]  Let's think about these things. Did you produce enough out of what you produced? Did you have enough to smoke?
[11:09.800 --> 11:14.240]  Did you have enough to do whatever you're doing with it? Then if money was made from that product
[11:14.240 --> 11:21.120]  Did you make enough money to cover your work your energy your costs and then have enough money to make it worth your time?
[11:21.280 --> 11:23.280]  Those are things I would think about
[11:23.280 --> 11:26.200]  So how much product did you produce in the last year?
[11:26.200 --> 11:30.320]  And the next question is how much do you plan to produce in the next year?
[11:30.320 --> 11:34.560]  Are you going to increase your production or are you okay with the amount that you produced?
[11:34.680 --> 11:36.760]  Can you increase production with your space?
[11:36.880 --> 11:43.640]  Can you increase production 10 20 maybe 30% with the room space you've got if you put more time and energy into it
[11:43.640 --> 11:46.920]  Could you do that? I don't know. I don't know how hard you worked last year
[11:46.920 --> 11:52.240]  But that is a goal that I would set how much more product am I going to produce this year?
[11:52.240 --> 11:55.600]  My next question is on a scale of 1 to 10
[11:55.760 --> 12:00.760]  How good is your product and this is where people get really messed up in their heads
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.960]  You have got to be honest with yourself about your product on a scale of 1 to 10
[12:05.960 --> 12:09.240]  How good is your product you may say out loud?
[12:09.240 --> 12:11.920]  It's a 10 because everybody's gonna say their herb is a 10
[12:11.920 --> 12:16.360]  But you may know inside that that shits a 4 and you got to work on getting it up to a 6
[12:16.360 --> 12:21.480]  So be honest with yourself give your herb an honest assessment compare it to a lot of other herb
[12:21.760 --> 12:23.600]  Find other growers that you respect
[12:23.600 --> 12:28.800]  Don't put yourself in a group of growers that you think you are better growers than them and compare your herb to it because of
[12:28.800 --> 12:33.380]  Course, it'll be better go find growers that you respect that you think are better growers than you
[12:33.500 --> 12:38.020]  Also hang out with the growers that you think you're better than them all of you put your herb in the table and compare it
[12:38.020 --> 12:43.180]  Let's see what everybody's doing find out where you really stand in the game and be honest with yourself
[12:43.180 --> 12:46.460]  If the shits not selling if it's not moving, that's a 3 or a 4 bro
[12:46.760 --> 12:52.220]  10 level 10 weed fucking moves itself 10 level 10 weed. You don't have to sell it that shit sells itself
[12:52.220 --> 12:57.420]  You just got to drive it to the next customer. So give your weed a reasonable assessment on a scale of 1 to 10
[12:57.540 --> 13:00.500]  How good is it if you can get a lab test a potency test?
[13:00.500 --> 13:06.740]  Which that again that's gonna raise a lot of controversy, but maybe you've got a lab test to compare it to what's your THC percentage?
[13:06.740 --> 13:09.060]  You're CBD percentage. What's your terpene percentage?
[13:09.060 --> 13:13.980]  Can we increase and improve on those numbers or can you just grow herb that you think is better?
[13:14.060 --> 13:16.540]  Than the herb you're growing now on a scale of 1 to 10
[13:16.540 --> 13:21.040]  How good is your weed if it's a 5 what would make it a 7 if it's a 7?
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.880]  What would make it an 8 if it's an 8 what would make it a 10 identify the issue?
[13:25.140 --> 13:29.460]  Was it something with the nutrients was it something in the dry and cure? Did you over water it?
[13:29.460 --> 13:30.500]  Did the room get too hot?
[13:30.500 --> 13:35.240]  Can you tell by looking at the buds that there was a fungus nap problem or can you tell by looking at the flowers?
[13:35.240 --> 13:40.740]  That there was a root aphid problem or can you tell by looking at the shape of the clusters and the little tiny misshapen?
[13:40.740 --> 13:47.160]  Buds that there was a a russet mite issue. Can you tell those things correct those issues? Does it taste funky?
[13:47.160 --> 13:49.440]  Was it too leafy? Did you let it get too dry?
[13:50.040 --> 13:52.580]  Correct those issues. You can see the problems
[13:52.580 --> 13:55.420]  Let's take your herb from a 6 to an 8 or an 8
[13:55.960 --> 13:58.000]  Possibly to a 10 if you can do it
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.200]  Of course, you got to get your ego out of the way to be able to do that one now
[14:01.600 --> 14:05.840]  Here are some more fun things to talk about. How many strains do you want to try this year?
[14:05.840 --> 14:07.200]  Do you know what you want to grow?
[14:07.200 --> 14:09.920]  Are you gonna grow the same old shit or do you have a few strains?
[14:10.200 --> 14:14.480]  Chosen and selected on your menu that you'd like to try to run this year. Do you have a schedule?
[14:14.480 --> 14:15.440]  Do you have a plan?
[14:15.440 --> 14:17.760]  Do you know how many crops are gonna turn this year?
[14:17.760 --> 14:22.120]  Have you divided the amount of days you used to flower by the amount of days in the year?
[14:22.120 --> 14:27.280]  To see how many crops you can fit in that flower room and see if you can cram one more in by doing something weird
[14:27.280 --> 14:32.120]  By just using space over here to move move this room from veg to flower a week early while they're all in there
[14:32.120 --> 14:34.380]  And then maybe I could squeeze in one more crop this year
[14:34.380 --> 14:39.380]  Have you done that math that stuff that I start thinking about right now at the beginning of the year?
[14:39.420 --> 14:44.100]  Which breeders are you going to support this year? Of course, I recommend you buy iri genetic seeds
[14:44.100 --> 14:49.080]  You're gonna find some good shit in there, but there are tons of other great breeders out there putting out great products
[14:49.080 --> 14:53.460]  Who are you gonna support this year? What strains from which breeders do you plan to grow?
[14:53.700 --> 14:57.200]  Then my next question is are you breeding? Do you have breeding goals?
[14:57.700 --> 15:01.860]  What is your breeding goal for the year? Do you plan to F to something?
[15:01.860 --> 15:06.180]  Are you going to F three something? Are you how far are you gonna go? Are you gonna make a new cross?
[15:06.300 --> 15:12.220]  How many new crosses are you going to make how many overall seeds? Do you plan or attend or intend?
[15:12.700 --> 15:17.780]  Anticipate making in the next calendar year. Those are things to write down if you're a seed breeder
[15:17.880 --> 15:21.360]  What is your goal for seed breeding? Are you trying to get those seeds to market?
[15:21.360 --> 15:24.220]  Are you trying to make seeds for you? Are you trying to make seeds for the homies?
[15:24.320 --> 15:25.500]  What are you trying to do?
[15:25.500 --> 15:28.280]  You're trying to isolate a terpene a cannabinoid a trait
[15:28.340 --> 15:33.440]  Write down those goals and figure out what you want to do as a breeder this year as a grower
[15:33.440 --> 15:38.920]  You need very specific calendars and ideas and goals as a breeder. Those are even more specific
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.360]  So let's get to setting some goals writing down a plan setting up some ideas so that we know where we're driving
[15:44.360 --> 15:46.360]  We're not just running through this year with no map
[15:46.500 --> 15:50.080]  Let's get the map printed out so we can all end up at the same winning
[15:50.900 --> 15:56.200]  Destination is there something in your grow a chore a task a mess a problem that you've been avoiding?
[15:56.240 --> 15:59.000]  Let's do that right here at the start of the year. Let's correct it
[15:59.000 --> 16:01.260]  If it's a problem that needs to be fixed and cost some money
[16:01.380 --> 16:03.980]  Let's throw some money at it and fix it if it's a mess
[16:03.980 --> 16:06.280]  You need to clean up get in there and clean it up
[16:06.280 --> 16:12.120]  If it's a shelf that needs to be reorganized or a bunch of shit that needs to be thrown away or lights that need to
[16:12.120 --> 16:14.840]  Be rehung. Let's just do that right here at the start of the year
[16:14.840 --> 16:19.720]  Let's bang it out get it out of the way start fresh so we can just rock this whole year nice and smooth
[16:20.080 --> 16:22.080]  Find that task you've been avoiding
[16:22.400 --> 16:29.500]  Identify it and let's make it a habit to do that task make it enjoyable feel some pride when you do it now
[16:29.500 --> 16:31.880]  Also, this is a good time to clean everything up
[16:31.880 --> 16:35.360]  This is the first of the year all that stuff that needs to be cleaned
[16:35.360 --> 16:36.520]  You know what I'm talking about
[16:36.520 --> 16:41.820]  I like to start from the top and work my way down look at the lights the tops of the lights are probably dusty
[16:41.820 --> 16:44.840]  I don't know what kind of lights you've got the tops of whatever lights you're using
[16:44.840 --> 16:49.300]  They're probably dusty and need a dusting so get up there and clean those lights get a ladder out you guys
[16:49.380 --> 16:52.860]  Get a ladder a couple of rags some spray bottles some cleaner
[16:52.860 --> 16:56.900]  Let's get to work and clean all this shit up start at the top and work our way down
[16:57.060 --> 17:02.000]  Just wipe everything down if you've got air conditioning if you've got ducting if you've got venting
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.100]  It probably all needs to be wiped down clean the tables clean the trays. Let's clean everything of course here in Colorado
[17:08.100 --> 17:12.820]  It's like 20 degrees so taking shit outside and hosing it down. It's not a fun option right now
[17:12.820 --> 17:16.900]  But if you're in a place where you can load up the shit and take it to the car wash one of those outdoor car
[17:16.900 --> 17:21.980]  washes go spray the shit out everything don't use too much of that car wash soap just use the water and the hose there and
[17:21.980 --> 17:29.080]  Spray the shit out of it rinse it real good. Let's get everything super clean start off nice and clean here for the start of the
[17:29.080 --> 17:32.600]  Year also, this is a good time to change all of your filters
[17:33.560 --> 17:41.440]  Anything that's got a filter everything's got a filter the air conditioner the humidifier the dehumidifier all those filters in your hydro gear anything with
[17:41.440 --> 17:46.000]  The filter now is a good time to change it. It's the first of the month the first of a new year
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.680]  Let's start off with all new filters. I know most of us are using LED lighting now
[17:50.680 --> 17:56.440]  I do have a couple of high-pressure sodium light fixtures in one grow space because it gets very cold in that
[17:56.840 --> 18:00.520]  Building and I use those HPS lights to keep that grow space warm
[18:00.720 --> 18:02.440]  So at the first of the year
[18:02.440 --> 18:08.360]  I would change the bulbs in those high-pressure sodium lamps and what I would do is I would take a piece of duct tape
[18:08.360 --> 18:10.200]  And I would write new bulbs
[18:10.200 --> 18:11.560]  January 1st
[18:11.560 --> 18:16.720]  2023 and I would stick that right on either the door to the grow room or I would tape it on to the reflector
[18:16.720 --> 18:22.280]  Itself out of the way on the side of the reflector stick that duct tape either on the door or on the reflector to indicate
[18:22.280 --> 18:25.720]  New bulbs January 1st, then we've got new bulbs in there
[18:25.720 --> 18:28.320]  Most of you don't need to worry about that because you've got the LEDs
[18:28.320 --> 18:33.240]  But if you're running something with a switchable bulb, why not put new bulbs in there and mark the date that you did it?
[18:33.240 --> 18:37.400]  Do you remember when you switched bulbs if you're using old lighting? Not everybody's in a
[18:37.920 --> 18:45.120]  Illegal growing state not everybody has access to new modern gear a lot of people out there are using old magnetic ballast and HPS bulbs
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.160]  So switch those out you guys put on a new bulb if you can do that here at the start of the year and definitely
[18:50.160 --> 18:54.260]  Mark it down also mark down when you change all those filters that we talked about changing
[18:54.260 --> 19:00.900]  It's not that hard to write just either in a notebook or a ledger or a Google Doc or somewhere change my filters change my
[19:00.900 --> 19:02.660]  bulbs January 1st
[19:02.660 --> 19:05.300]  Now if we're changing bulbs and changing filters, you know
[19:05.300 --> 19:11.860]  It's also time to calibrate all of our equipment if you've got a pH pan now is a good time to calibrate that pH pan
[19:12.140 --> 19:17.780]  Also, if you've got any automation or room sensors that are checking for moisture humidity temperature
[19:17.780 --> 19:23.940]  I'm not sure which sensors you're using but now is a good time to clean them calibrate them and test them
[19:23.940 --> 19:25.740]  Let's make sure that all of the expensive toys
[19:25.740 --> 19:30.520]  We're buying and using are taken good care of and up to speed and calibrated
[19:30.520 --> 19:35.220]  So they work the way we are expecting them to so clean all the filters calibrate all the gear
[19:35.220 --> 19:38.800]  I don't know what filters. I don't know what needs to be cleaned in your grow. That's up to you
[19:38.800 --> 19:44.720]  But you've got an air conditioner filter. I'm sure there's probably a dehumidifier filter a humidifier filter
[19:44.820 --> 19:48.860]  Maybe go clean all the fans. All the fans are super funky. I promise you by now
[19:48.860 --> 19:54.780]  They're dirty and need a cleaning so do a general inspection and prepare for a big spring cleaning
[19:54.780 --> 20:00.620]  I mentioned a moment ago that it's 20 degrees here in Colorado. I'm gonna prepare for a spring cleaning
[20:00.620 --> 20:01.940]  I'm gonna bang out one more crop
[20:01.940 --> 20:06.780]  I know that that crop will be done by March the middle of March at the latest by the end of that crop
[20:06.780 --> 20:09.260]  I'm gonna tear down the entire room and do a full spring cleaning
[20:09.620 --> 20:13.740]  Rehang everything all over again because of course when spring gets here in Colorado
[20:13.740 --> 20:18.660]  We've got to redo some of the rooms have to be redone and reconfigured a little bit differently because like I mentioned
[20:18.860 --> 20:24.740]  It's been negative six somewhere between it's been cold. You guys don't care about specific numbers
[20:24.740 --> 20:29.700]  It's been fucking cold, but it's going to get the opposite here in about six months. It'll be a hundred and fourteen degrees
[20:29.740 --> 20:33.380]  So I've got to reconfigure my grow at the spring time to prepare for that stuff
[20:33.380 --> 20:37.420]  So get yourself ready for a spring cleaning if you are in a cold area
[20:37.620 --> 20:40.100]  definitely inspect the air conditioner the the
[20:40.300 --> 20:45.780]  Dehumidifier the humidifier all that stuff that moves all the ducting all the ventilation if you've got co2
[20:46.060 --> 20:50.360]  Production equipment if it's a burner or if it's tanks definitely inspect all of that shit
[20:50.900 --> 20:54.540]  Another thing I like to do here at the start of the year is order all of the supplies
[20:54.540 --> 20:57.220]  I anticipate I will need for the next couple of months
[20:57.820 --> 21:01.460]  Shipping is really expensive. Sometimes you'll get a deal on ordering things in bulk
[21:01.500 --> 21:04.420]  So I like to just place a big order and get all of the stuff
[21:04.420 --> 21:09.640]  I need all at one time at the start of the year things like nutrients pesticides and gloves
[21:09.640 --> 21:12.140]  We know we're gonna use those you have to have those things
[21:12.180 --> 21:16.780]  Why not order them here at the start of the year get them out of the way that way the budget is freed up for
[21:16.780 --> 21:21.400]  The rest of the year to get nutrients pesticides gloves things like scissors
[21:21.400 --> 21:24.620]  How many pairs of scissors will you go through in the next couple of months?
[21:24.620 --> 21:29.580]  I know I'll need at least two why not order two maybe if somebody comes to help I'll need two pairs of scissors
[21:30.220 --> 21:34.860]  ISO I go through a lot of isopropyl alcohol here not just for cleaning shit in the grow
[21:35.140 --> 21:39.820]  But also for cleaning shit Mike smoking accessories for cleaning the table. Everything is sticky here
[21:39.820 --> 21:43.380]  So I got to order a bunch of ISO here at the start of the year just to have it available
[21:43.860 --> 21:48.460]  What are you using to clean your scissors to prevent the spread of hoplate and viroid?
[21:48.460 --> 21:52.900]  Are you cleaning your scissors with anything? Maybe you need a small container of bleach in your grow
[21:53.020 --> 21:55.360]  Maybe you need more cleaning supplies in your grow
[21:55.360 --> 21:56.980]  I don't know exactly what you need
[21:56.980 --> 22:02.620]  But now is a good time to think about ordering those things you're going to need some cleaning supplies like a mop some sort of
[22:02.620 --> 22:05.540]  A cleaner maybe rags maybe spray bottles
[22:05.540 --> 22:09.860]  I don't know how you do it, but I know that I need those products other things. I think about is
[22:10.500 --> 22:15.460]  Refreshing my mixing cups and measuring devices some of my nutrients are powdered
[22:15.460 --> 22:20.320]  I use a scale make sure that scale is nice and clean make sure it's zeroed and dialed in that way
[22:20.320 --> 22:21.860]  I've got a good measurement
[22:21.860 --> 22:26.380]  My measuring cups are filthy. I try to clean them, but after a while they get stained
[22:26.380 --> 22:32.140]  I use liquid nutrients with colors the the cups have changed colors. They look like shit. It's hard
[22:32.140 --> 22:34.300]  It's not completely easy to read the measurements
[22:34.300 --> 22:39.780]  I will replace those here at the start of the year just because I want to make sure I am measuring my expensive nutrients as
[22:40.180 --> 22:45.940]  Accurately as possible. So make a big order order all of the supplies you need here right at the start of the year
[22:45.940 --> 22:48.780]  Now that leads me into another part that we should talk about
[22:48.780 --> 22:56.700]  Maybe now is a good time to start keeping a ledger or keeping track of your income and expenses based on your grow
[22:56.700 --> 22:58.420]  Do you have a profit and loss?
[22:58.420 --> 23:05.100]  Sheet for your grow or any other business attached to that if you're in an illegal area and you're growing business-wise
[23:05.100 --> 23:09.020]  Maybe you don't want all this stuff as easily accessible or readily available
[23:09.020 --> 23:10.300]  That may be evidence
[23:10.300 --> 23:15.540]  But if you are in a legal state and you are growing it is completely reasonable to keep a ledger and a profit and loss
[23:15.540 --> 23:20.900]  Sheet based on your grow. What does your grow cost? What are you spending on electricity?
[23:20.900 --> 23:25.300]  What are you spending on nutrients co2 all of that stuff adds up and matters, right?
[23:25.300 --> 23:29.220]  All of that stuff down then document how much product you produced
[23:29.340 --> 23:33.940]  Estimate how much that product is worth and see if you are making a profit or a loss
[23:34.300 --> 23:37.540]  Also include your time in there. You're spending time in the grow
[23:37.540 --> 23:42.940]  Maybe it's time to start keeping track of how many hours a day or a week you are actually in that grow space
[23:43.140 --> 23:50.340]  So let's start documenting things like electrical spending nutrient spending. How much do all those nutrients cost every bottle? Let's write it down
[23:50.780 --> 23:52.780]  How much are you spending on co2
[23:52.820 --> 23:57.460]  Did you buy a co2 burner? Did you buy a setup and are you replacing bottles every week?
[23:57.540 --> 23:59.540]  What are you doing for co2 augmentation?
[24:00.380 --> 24:05.240]  Also people don't think about the cost of water. It comes out of a faucet you turn it on it comes out
[24:05.240 --> 24:09.140]  We don't think about paying for it at the end of the month. How much water are you spending?
[24:09.140 --> 24:11.780]  Do you pay the water bill or does the landlord pay the water bill?
[24:12.220 --> 24:18.620]  If the landlord pays it are they noticing that you're using extra water for the grow if it's a small grow probably not if you've
[24:18.620 --> 24:20.100]  Got a few lights
[24:20.100 --> 24:22.340]  They might notice the increase in water fees
[24:22.620 --> 24:26.360]  How about rent for the building if you're growing in a building that is not your home?
[24:26.380 --> 24:31.920]  You're probably paying extra rent for that building. What does that cost you? Is that eating up your profits?
[24:31.920 --> 24:37.500]  I know it's the only place you've got to do it. But let's include that into the cost of doing business here
[24:37.500 --> 24:39.540]  How about employees? Do you have a trimmer?
[24:39.540 --> 24:42.460]  Do you have a bro that comes and helps you or a lady that comes and helps you?
[24:42.460 --> 24:46.300]  Do you have security? Do you have a dog that dog that works security at the grow?
[24:46.300 --> 24:49.020]  That is a cost you got to feed the dog. It's got to go to the vet
[24:49.060 --> 24:51.980]  That is part of your cost of doing business for that grow
[24:52.540 --> 24:53.820]  How about gas?
[24:53.820 --> 24:57.340]  Do you have to drive to the grow or if the grows located in your home?
[24:57.340 --> 24:59.140]  You got to walk down there that doesn't cost anything
[24:59.140 --> 25:04.540]  But if you've got to drive a few miles to it that does add up over the year. How much does that gasoline cost?
[25:05.140 --> 25:10.660]  Speaking of gasoline. How about a backup generator diesel fuel cost money. Did you buy a generator?
[25:10.660 --> 25:15.180]  Did you have that attached to your breaker box in your home? Do you have diesel fuel in that generator?
[25:15.220 --> 25:20.820]  Do you have all the switches and jump boxes you needed to where when the power goes off in your spot that generator fires up?
[25:20.820 --> 25:24.500]  Immediately in your home. So where you don't even notice there was a miss in power. Do you have that?
[25:24.540 --> 25:29.300]  How much did it cost how much does the diesel fuel that's in their cost if it comes on it?
[25:29.420 --> 25:34.420]  Immediately starts costing you money that diesel feels running cost any money tick-tock tick-tock ching-ching-ching
[25:34.420 --> 25:39.020]  That's just coins falling through the generator machine right there. How much does that cost you?
[25:39.540 --> 25:43.860]  What about security costs? Do you have security? Are you security?
[25:43.860 --> 25:50.180]  Did you buy anything to use as security in case something goes wrong? All of those things cost you money?
[25:50.180 --> 25:54.220]  Are you using cameras the cameras are gonna cost you money write that down
[25:54.540 --> 25:57.740]  Also, if you use cameras, are you providing the service?
[25:57.740 --> 26:00.020]  Are you providing the data or do you have a service?
[26:00.340 --> 26:03.780]  backing up all the video footage for you most of us have a ring cam or
[26:03.780 --> 26:09.500]  The the blink cam or some service out there that you got to pay bucks a month or something for are you paying for that?
[26:09.500 --> 26:13.540]  Write that down document that in your ledger treat this like a real business
[26:13.540 --> 26:16.700]  If you want it to be profitable if you want to make money off of it
[26:16.700 --> 26:21.940]  If you want to document your spending income and outcome profit and loss, you've got to document all of this stuff
[26:22.180 --> 26:26.940]  It's how a real business does it and you've got to start doing that. What else are you paying for?
[26:26.940 --> 26:31.060]  I'm not sure the other specifics in your grow, but everything costs money
[26:31.060 --> 26:34.060]  Do you have to put up new mylar did you have to buy a new pen to film?
[26:34.060 --> 26:40.060]  Did you have to replace a light document all of that stuff a pH pen pH down all that shits going to cost money?
[26:40.260 --> 26:45.640]  Now is a good time to start documenting things and keeping notes for a whole year worth of bookkeeping
[26:45.640 --> 26:49.660]  You can do this on paper. You can do it on Google Sheets. You can do it in whatever
[26:49.740 --> 26:54.660]  There's a thousand different methods of doing this as long as you're doing it in some sort of way making an effort
[26:54.660 --> 26:58.500]  You'll improve on it every year and you'll realize there are better easier ways to do it
[26:58.500 --> 27:02.980]  So start making notes start keeping that profit and loss sheet start documenting
[27:03.460 --> 27:09.000]  How many plants did you grow if you can that's another I've got the words be careful written right here really big on my notes
[27:10.180 --> 27:17.420]  If you can safely document this stuff document as much as possible. How many plants did you grow this run?
[27:17.940 --> 27:21.980]  How many days did they go? How much did each plant harvest?
[27:21.980 --> 27:25.980]  What was your total harvest weight and then how much from that harvest weight?
[27:25.980 --> 27:31.380]  Do you think that that would be market value then look back and see what it cost you to produce each gram of that herb
[27:31.620 --> 27:34.540]  Then look and see if like I said before you've got to pay yourself
[27:34.540 --> 27:36.540]  Do you get a salary included in there?
[27:36.620 --> 27:41.180]  Maybe include and write down how many hours are in there and see if you even make a salary
[27:41.300 --> 27:43.460]  Let's start marking all of that down
[27:43.460 --> 27:48.860]  But again be very careful because that if you're not in a legal state that could be dangerous data
[27:48.940 --> 27:51.660]  So the most important part here is have a goal
[27:51.660 --> 27:57.700]  But my most important message is have fun and then most importantly that your mom is gonna say be careful and be safe
[27:57.700 --> 28:05.360]  So have fun have a goal be careful be safe grow from your heart breed with love and let's kick some fucking ass in
[28:05.740 --> 28:07.900]  2023 you guys we had a rough couple of years
[28:07.900 --> 28:09.960]  I don't want to get all weird on you here at the end of the podcast
[28:09.960 --> 28:15.140]  But man the past couple of years have been weird on everybody. It's been stressful. It's been strange
[28:15.220 --> 28:21.260]  It's been new and uncomfortable. We've just been stirred up and shaken up. A lot of us are getting back to normal from it
[28:21.260 --> 28:22.820]  I still see weird lasting effects
[28:22.820 --> 28:26.380]  Like you see weird societal effects from being locked down for fucking two years
[28:26.380 --> 28:28.180]  The world is just getting a shit back together
[28:28.180 --> 28:33.540]  A lot of my favorite restaurants and stores that things are just fucking gone things have disappeared things are different now
[28:33.540 --> 28:39.100]  But it feels like things are kind of it's kind of starting to get back to as close to normal as we're gonna feel
[28:39.100 --> 28:43.460]  Like for a little while it's gonna take a while before we feel real normalcy again, but we're starting to get there
[28:43.460 --> 28:47.300]  It's headed that direction. So supplies are coming back schedules are coming back
[28:47.300 --> 28:51.620]  People aren't sick and fucking quarantining and hiding from each other as much as we were before
[28:51.740 --> 28:57.100]  So the world is coming back. Let's kick some ass this year you guys let's not use any weird excuses
[28:57.100 --> 29:01.500]  Let's not let pandemic and weird shit the C word. I'm not even gonna say the C word
