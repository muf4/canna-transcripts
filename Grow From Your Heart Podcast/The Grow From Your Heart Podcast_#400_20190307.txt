[08:30.680 --> 08:40.020]  ♪♪
[08:40.020 --> 08:50.020]  ♪♪
[08:50.020 --> 08:54.580]  cool that was like really hardcore and I why not let's do it maybe at the end of an episode right
[08:54.580 --> 09:02.020]  in the middle right in the middle just now yeah so now here's a hardcore song all right we're back
[09:02.020 --> 09:08.420]  our friends at deicide sent us this yeah deicide take me back to eighth grade bro man I don't want
[09:08.420 --> 09:13.300]  to think about metal sorry all right well you brought it up I know I did I'm apologizing for it
[09:15.060 --> 09:18.660]  so if you do have an intro track even if you are deicide I'll play it on the show
[09:18.980 --> 09:23.460]  you can send it to me at growfromyourheart at hotmail.com is the best way to get it to me
[09:23.460 --> 09:28.020]  I want to hear what you're doing musically I am honestly not the best musical producer when
[09:28.020 --> 09:34.500]  it comes to creating my own intro tracks with the computer I mean it sounded like you did pretty good
[09:34.500 --> 09:40.340]  to me but I mean these guys will see it pretty soon they'll hear it Mike just started to speak
[09:40.340 --> 09:45.940]  about it and then gave up what I heard was technically music and it was technically original
[09:45.940 --> 09:50.660]  so I don't I mean YouTube might have some problems with it but I don't think it's gonna flag it oh
[09:50.660 --> 09:53.780]  that's all original that stuff is gonna fly at some of the reggae tracks that I've built with
[09:53.780 --> 09:58.740]  GarageBand YouTube has been like no that's a ripoff and I'm like but I mean it's already flagged
[09:58.740 --> 10:05.300]  that one beat dude yeah it knows the boom I know and it's just you can't teach YouTube that
[10:06.180 --> 10:11.700]  there are different songs that have that beat yeah I get it Mike I get it yeah I've been trying not
[10:11.700 --> 10:16.180]  to make that joke for three minutes and you can change the topic I know I saw it on your face two
[10:16.180 --> 10:19.860]  minutes ago I just had to keep pushing that's why I knew you're going boom chicka headed there
[10:19.860 --> 10:26.420]  all right new music would be highly appreciated even if it does go boom chicka boom chicka or
[10:26.420 --> 10:31.780]  guar I'd play guar that'd be cool I spaced the name of the band for you side would guar be cool
[10:32.980 --> 10:36.420]  you go see guar and instead of just throwing like weird shit at you they throw like joints
[10:36.820 --> 10:42.580]  somewhere out in the world right now there's an iry army member that's also a big metal fan that's
[10:42.580 --> 10:48.100]  just like why do my two worlds fucking hate each other no I have no hatred toward the metal people
[10:48.100 --> 10:52.100]  would be surprised uh Clint this is kind of what brought up the metal to be honest uh Clint and I
[10:52.100 --> 10:55.140]  were hanging out a little bit before Mike came I was dabbing Clint was smoking a bowl and we're
[10:55.140 --> 10:58.980]  just talking about music uh Clint brought up one of his favorite bands from back in the day
[10:59.540 --> 11:03.940]  and uh I enjoyed it but it wasn't my thing and I was like that's like this band with a different
[11:03.940 --> 11:08.020]  kind of singer so I went and played some hardcore stuff and Clint was like no no no no no that's not
[11:08.020 --> 11:11.620]  for me and I was like so it's like similar music the background tracks were the same but the
[11:11.620 --> 11:17.460]  singers were way on different levels uh when I was younger I like to delve into the really uh
[11:17.460 --> 11:22.100]  the aggressive side of music I just enjoy music altogether I can listen to some jazz I can listen
[11:22.100 --> 11:26.740]  to a little bit of death metal uh but of course I'd prefer some fish or some reggae but yeah I
[11:26.740 --> 11:29.700]  appreciate all kinds of good music but that's where that came from we're talking about old
[11:29.700 --> 11:33.060]  music back in the day uh what was the name of that band you were jamming dude I can't think of
[11:33.060 --> 11:38.500]  the name of the one I liked yeah oh uh protest the hero protest of the hero so if you guys like
[11:38.500 --> 11:43.140]  them we leave a comment or something yeah tell us what you think about protest of the hero that is
[11:43.140 --> 11:48.020]  uh one of Clint's favorite bands those guys are cool from nice guys what what grade were you in
[11:48.020 --> 11:55.620]  when you fell in love with that band like uh senior in high school okay all right perfect yeah
[11:55.620 --> 12:00.180]  I don't know somewhere around there have your have your musical tastes changed now that you're a
[12:00.180 --> 12:07.540]  pawhead no I'm still listening to like a lot of the same music I feel like my dad how he just never
[12:07.540 --> 12:12.820]  stopped listening to the who that's kind of how I'm doing things now is like no I'm just gonna
[12:12.820 --> 12:20.260]  listen to like kill switch engage from like 2010 like that's like my favorite era of metal music
[12:20.260 --> 12:24.180]  so it's like I'll just stick with that I don't need new stuff it ain't broke don't change it bro
[12:24.180 --> 12:29.380]  yeah that's why my sound cloud's not working very good do you still dress like you did uh from that
[12:29.380 --> 12:35.300]  era also yeah I think just jeans and t-shirt kind of guy though guys that's a guy thing it's what we
[12:35.300 --> 12:41.140]  tend to do like around high school graduation year around 20 that's what we're gonna dress like
[12:41.140 --> 12:44.900]  that's how you dress from now on I think that's Mike's kind of staring off into space trying to
[12:44.900 --> 12:50.580]  do the math on that no I'm actually I've every time I look at my closet I feel guilt over this
[12:50.580 --> 12:58.500]  phenomenon because I'm like I'm familiar with the concept of man boys I don't want to personify this
[12:58.500 --> 13:04.900]  but I will not change my baggy jeans to doctors it's not gonna fucking happen yeah Mike is wearing
[13:04.900 --> 13:12.100]  genco's tonight I can't give them up it's and it's part of me from that era it's a really weird
[13:12.100 --> 13:18.500]  podcast tonight yeah this is one of the welcome to thunderdome bitches it is episode 400 I did
[13:18.500 --> 13:21.620]  not say that we're gonna talk about any growing or any weed stuff we're just gonna have a good
[13:21.620 --> 13:25.380]  time tonight you guys know you're here you already hit play you're stuck with us enjoy
[13:25.380 --> 13:29.300]  well that's not really true they could definitely take no that button's broken
[13:30.180 --> 13:33.780]  there's a mashing on that 30 second forward button like do they ever get to anything
[13:33.780 --> 13:39.300]  does this fucking go anywhere we'll see we'll see take this ride with us please we could take it
[13:39.300 --> 13:42.900]  some more we've gone for a few minutes now I do have one thing planned that we can handle real
[13:42.900 --> 13:49.620]  quick uh does anybody need a dab before we get into some iTunes uh customer reviews I'm good
[13:49.620 --> 13:54.740]  Mike said I'm good Clint you want your first dab on the podcast no that was you could have
[13:54.740 --> 14:01.780]  hesitated and maybe like no no I think it's way better that I don't I think the audience could
[14:01.780 --> 14:09.060]  know that I don't do dabs I just I feel like this is behavior we should encourage like not
[14:09.060 --> 14:14.260]  over consuming is a good thing I think all three of us are too old to be carried home by our
[14:14.260 --> 14:18.260]  friends from a night out oh he's fucking six four and two hundred pounds he ain't getting carried
[14:18.260 --> 14:22.180]  too far I'll make him to that couch and that's probably where he spends the evening right yeah
[14:22.260 --> 14:28.500]  like it's weird to explain that you blacked out at a friend's house because you over consumed and
[14:29.540 --> 14:33.460]  that's why you didn't get home till 10 the next day it's really heartbreaking to have to call
[14:33.460 --> 14:39.060]  your adult friends wives to come pick them up yeah so like it was cool when we were 22 I was
[14:39.060 --> 14:44.500]  like oh so and so needs to get carried home like I'll help but now it's a little weird now it is
[14:44.500 --> 14:47.460]  strange all right I'm trying not to move the computer too much because we have all of the
[14:47.460 --> 14:52.100]  technology plugged in it don't jiggle or do jiggle it but don't move the computer too much
[14:52.100 --> 14:56.180]  when you've got the USB plugged in here and you're trying not to break anything and you hope you're
[14:56.180 --> 15:00.420]  still recording because you can't see the screen anyway we're gonna read some iTunes customer
[15:00.420 --> 15:04.900]  ratings and reviews I like to do that on the podcast here this first review I don't know if
[15:04.900 --> 15:08.020]  I have read this one it feels like I may have read this one but it's a good review so we're
[15:08.020 --> 15:12.420]  gonna do it again anyway this one comes from a person who calls themselves ganja goddess they

[17:18.020 --> 17:25.780]  five-star review this one was left on February 4th of 2019 and the review goes a lot like this
[17:26.580 --> 17:31.300]  I looked away and I can't find it again what are the most detailed and accurate grow podcasts out
[17:31.300 --> 17:37.140]  Rasta Jeff makes it way easy to grow seed to harvest the episodes with white Mike and others
[17:37.140 --> 17:43.060]  are also nice to stay on stay up on the state of the industry weekly episodes from a long-time
[17:43.060 --> 17:49.060]  grower and breeder are not one to miss hey Mike they like the episodes with you appreciate it
[17:49.060 --> 17:52.500]  and they like the episodes with other people so that's you Clint hey I'm there yeah you're in this
[17:52.500 --> 17:56.900]  one you're involved yeah they like you five stars today I'm doing it guys you did a gold star
[17:58.100 --> 18:01.220]  hey freedom thank you for the great review I know we're joking around today but I do appreciate
[18:01.220 --> 18:07.860]  these reviews we're having fun on episode 420 or 400 oh I jumped the gun oh I know it's gonna happen
[18:07.860 --> 18:10.900]  I'm not gonna edit that she's gonna beep it out that's all right I'm not gonna beep it we're just
[18:10.900 --> 18:17.220]  too high there's no editing in this show live to drive baby it's how we're doing it uh freedom 35
[18:17.220 --> 18:21.700]  thank you for the great review thank you for the five stars I'm glad you appreciate the detailed
[18:21.700 --> 18:26.100]  grow lessons um and I'm glad I'm making it easy for you that's kind of what I'm here for is to
[18:26.100 --> 18:30.340]  kind of take the stress off of a grower it can be really stressful setting up your first growth
[18:30.340 --> 18:33.220]  you've got a lot of equipment to think about you've got a lot of plans to think about you've
[18:33.220 --> 18:36.900]  got rules to follow and then you've got these plants I like your new babies it's like getting
[18:36.900 --> 18:40.820]  a kitten but it doesn't meow and eat normal food you got to figure it out you know what I mean like
[18:40.820 --> 18:44.100]  a kitten just would look at you go meow and you got to feed it then it goes on shits on the floor
[18:44.900 --> 18:48.980]  come with instructions either that's right that is very true so it's a little challenging it
[18:48.980 --> 18:53.060]  becomes stressful so I'm glad that I'm easing the stress for the grower making it fun instead
[18:53.060 --> 18:56.900]  of stressful and I'm also I feel like I'm improving the quality of people's outcome
[18:56.900 --> 19:01.780]  so instead of growing mid-grade the first time they're growing kind of low high grade like the
[19:01.780 --> 19:05.780]  lowest of the high grade quality and then they have opportunity for super high grade next time
[19:05.780 --> 19:09.940]  and it's just more encouragement instead of starting off almost failing your first try
[19:09.940 --> 19:16.420]  well it's nice being able to listen to it for free um over and over if you need for free yeah
[19:16.420 --> 19:20.500]  you can just hit that rewind and repeat button and keep listening well like or you're coming back
[19:20.500 --> 19:24.340]  to something it's like well what was that I remember him saying something about that and I'm
[19:24.340 --> 19:31.940]  sure that I I mean leave your comments below um let us know when Ross to Jeff told you something
[19:31.940 --> 19:35.940]  that like helped you out a whole bunch that's pretty cool there you go yeah what's your favorite
[19:35.940 --> 19:40.980]  episode let me know because I am making a compilate compilation of best podcast episodes also
[19:40.980 --> 19:44.740]  it will be on a playlist on YouTube so let me know which episodes you learned the most from
[19:44.740 --> 19:49.300]  and I'll make sure to include those episodes in my compilations that way they're easy to find
[19:49.300 --> 19:53.940]  and they'll get a lot of views that'll be cool hell yeah Mike you have a really serious look
[19:53.940 --> 19:58.500]  of concern on your face over there not concerned at all not concerned nope all right as long as
[19:58.500 --> 20:02.100]  you're cool over there we're doing it I'm doing it everybody's still recording I think we're still
[20:02.100 --> 20:05.460]  recording I haven't looked at the thing in a while but I'm pretty sure that since nobody's hit stop
[20:05.460 --> 20:09.460]  as soon as you mentioned it I became concerned also isn't it a weird feeling you're not even
[20:09.460 --> 20:13.620]  the show producer I just realized that I always see the sound levels in the background and they're
[20:13.620 --> 20:18.100]  not there now yeah all of this could be disappearing into the ether this could be a one-time thing
[20:18.740 --> 20:24.500]  but I think it's working this might just be for us it might be but I have a feeling it's working
[20:24.500 --> 20:29.540]  so it feels dumb just doing all this part so let's get back to these reviews thanks freedom
[20:29.540 --> 20:33.060]  this uh yeah thanks a lot freedom 35 I do appreciate that even though we are
[20:33.060 --> 20:37.460]  fucking super lit today I do appreciate the reviews the next customer review comes from
[20:37.460 --> 20:43.940]  somebody that calls themselves sebfan2200 the headline says outstanding show of course they
[20:43.940 --> 20:49.940]  gave us a five-star review this review was left on February 16th of 2019 and it says I've listened
[20:49.940 --> 20:57.140]  to numerous grow related podcasts and this one is most definitely on another level my go-to podcast
[20:57.140 --> 21:02.260]  dude thank you that is a huge compliment hopefully we're taking your grow to another level and I'm
[21:02.260 --> 21:06.660]  glad that it's your go-to podcast I appreciate that uh thanks for listening I always say that
[21:06.660 --> 21:11.540]  it's no competition I do appreciate that there are our other grow podcasts but it always does
[21:11.540 --> 21:14.820]  feel good for somebody to say that you're the best even when there's no competition
[21:15.540 --> 21:20.820]  but I just get a participation trophy is that what I just got I think you're uh you're the one
[21:20.820 --> 21:26.660]  that's doing it the longest trying the hardest and just to ease everybody's mind it was still
[21:26.660 --> 21:32.260]  recording there you guys hey I'm glad all the people that are listening to this recording
[21:32.260 --> 21:36.180]  who were probably worried about that are now at ease right it's like watching a movie when you
[21:36.180 --> 21:40.100]  wonder if the person lived but you know that they lived because they're in the fucking documentary
[21:40.100 --> 21:43.620]  doing fucking interviews you're like I wonder if he's okay and you're like oh wait there he is with
[21:43.620 --> 21:49.780]  both legs yeah he survived or like uh the second movie you see the trailer for it or something oh
[21:49.780 --> 21:53.940]  he's still alive there's a part two I know he lives if this was live that would have been a
[21:53.940 --> 21:58.660]  really interesting moment where the listeners knew shit that the broadcasters didn't okay you guys
[21:58.660 --> 22:03.780]  are still on we start getting tweets you're still alive bro don't worry about it it's still going
[22:04.180 --> 22:07.940]  twilight zone of podcasts I like it tweet us now and let us know if we're still on
[22:09.540 --> 22:14.180]  yeah that's why I gave away my non-twitter handle on twitter handle I'm no longer on twitter
[22:14.180 --> 22:18.740]  forever forever all right I see you on there you make really great tweets I like your tweets
[22:18.740 --> 22:22.580]  yeah they're pretty positive yeah they're cool we'll keep them we'll keep them private I like

[22:37.620 --> 22:42.740]  listen to the show which in turn means more people grow high quality cannabis which means in turn
[22:42.740 --> 22:47.620]  we have more people on team green to help us fight the legalization battle so we're doing our part

[23:01.860 --> 23:05.780]  and when it shows the available episodes scroll up and if you scroll too far it will give you
[23:05.780 --> 23:10.900]  the option to leave a rating and review of course I do appreciate five stars but leave what you
[23:10.900 --> 23:15.300]  really honestly feel I deserve so far we've gotten all five star reviews except for that one guy who
[23:15.300 --> 23:20.900]  left a really terrible review I honestly have no power to remove reviews iTunes took that down
[23:20.900 --> 23:25.540]  I didn't do it I can't do it I have no access to that iTunes has taken that review down it is gone
[23:26.180 --> 23:30.580]  that's good yeah that means 100% it means enough people went and reported it and said that it was
[23:30.580 --> 23:34.980]  a negative comment and that it didn't wasn't valid it wasn't valid yeah it was just a hater comment so
[23:36.420 --> 23:38.900]  we probably the guys we're talking to right now thanks guys
[23:40.820 --> 23:44.500]  I like that we got the better that you got the bad comment because it brought up your
[23:44.500 --> 23:48.180]  overall ranking yes once you get a negative comment it believes that you're real like if
[23:48.180 --> 23:50.900]  you have just a bunch of good comments and you could just be about like you said a bunch of
[23:50.900 --> 23:55.140]  Russian bots just being I like show great show thumbs up yeah but instead we got one like these
[23:55.220 --> 23:59.540]  guys are fucking whack and they left us two stars and a thumbs down or something yeah so that made
[23:59.540 --> 24:03.940]  it real you know it's fine oh you have a complaint you must be real oh I bet iTunes remembered the
[24:03.940 --> 24:09.940]  realness though yeah oh yeah for sure yeah well the internet remembers the always remembers
[24:10.660 --> 24:14.420]  the internet remembers everything I hope it doesn't remember this for too long
[24:15.780 --> 24:19.140]  yeah this is permanent that's one of the things that you got to remember when you're here this
[24:19.140 --> 24:23.460]  is permanent here I'm gonna take this sip of this frosty cold beverage that doesn't pay us to

[25:09.140 --> 25:15.300]  and uh it is all coming together uh being in the industry which I am in and being the person I've
[25:15.300 --> 25:20.340]  been trying to be and putting my energy in the direction I'm trying to get it um it is coming
[25:20.340 --> 25:25.540]  together I think Indo Expo was one of the first things that showed me it is really working many
[25:25.540 --> 25:32.020]  many people walked up listeners fellow podcasters uh fellow breeders growers they walked up and
[25:32.020 --> 25:38.500]  wanted to shake my hand uh 70% because of iReGenetics and the breeding and the cannabis
[25:38.500 --> 25:45.620]  industry work a good solid 30% was all podcast friends and listeners and uh Shango Lowe's walked
[25:45.620 --> 25:50.500]  up and wanted to say hi and thank me for a great podcast and he told me that his my shout out to
[25:50.500 --> 25:54.660]  his show increased his audience so just knowing that I can increase somebody else's audience was
[25:54.660 --> 25:59.140]  kind of cool so thank you man I appreciate it and I do feel it finally it is what you said I hope it
[25:59.140 --> 26:03.860]  rewards me the way it should it is it is all coming together now and I'm starting to feel it and see it
[26:03.860 --> 26:08.100]  and although it it's almost 10 years in the making in this industry doing what I've been trying to do
[26:08.100 --> 26:12.660]  and it is finally paying off so you guys if you've been doing something for a long time just keep
[26:12.660 --> 26:16.100]  doing it it'll come together if you get your heart and soul into it it's not killing you doing it
[26:16.100 --> 26:19.140]  you're loving it keep putting it in there it's gonna take you about 10 years to get anywhere
[26:19.140 --> 26:25.300]  with the real business yeah very true very very true but thank you dude I do appreciate that uh
[26:25.300 --> 26:29.540]  with that being said I'm gonna take a dab I'm gonna I may have to start another jar here look
[26:29.540 --> 26:33.460]  we scraped this one clean that's the saddest concentrate jar ever you open that up and it's
[26:33.460 --> 26:39.300]  just hollow hey Mike happy Christmas there's like five Mike dabs in here never mind yeah you
[26:39.300 --> 26:43.780]  could probably scrape something out of there there's a quarter of a Jeff dab and five Mike
[26:43.780 --> 26:50.020]  dabs and uh zero Clint dabs there's all the Clint dabs no there's a million zero in there that I'm
[26:50.020 --> 26:56.020]  going to take so I'm taking a little bit of this vanilla cookies batter and I'm taking the last
[26:56.020 --> 27:01.940]  HCFSE crystal out of this uh star guava and I'm just gonna scrape in the jar and then I'm gonna
[27:01.940 --> 27:06.740]  dab that um which one of you guys is gonna talk about some cool shit while I take this out here
[27:06.740 --> 27:09.860]  you can take that jar too Mike I bet you can scrape a half a dab out of those two together
[27:09.860 --> 27:14.020]  cool stuff huh well you know I'm I mean I'm not cool relative
[27:16.980 --> 27:23.220]  boy really put me on the spot for this one let's see I believe dabs look like drugs
[27:25.380 --> 27:30.100]  so that's a really good that that's I'm all about this conversation as I'm gonna call you an
[27:30.100 --> 27:34.660]  outsider um yeah you're not into the cannabis culture you said earlier I don't even care what
[27:34.660 --> 27:38.420]  strain I'm smoking as long as it fucking gets me stoned I only need two hits anyway so I don't
[27:38.420 --> 27:43.060]  really consider you you are a cannabis consumer you are part of team IRIE genetics you're part
[27:43.060 --> 27:48.020]  of the IRIE army but you're not uh ah you're you're cannabis community but you're not part
[27:48.020 --> 27:51.940]  of the like the hip culture part of it you know what I mean you don't care to be you don't care
[27:51.940 --> 27:56.100]  you just don't care to wear the cool clothes anybody wears you don't care to be cool to be
[27:56.100 --> 28:00.100]  seen you're gonna take care of your family and be clean that's me so it's kind of I'm gonna call
[28:00.100 --> 28:06.980]  you an outsider to this culture yes as an outsider how bad does this look like drugs
[28:08.100 --> 28:14.740]  there's there's some of like the the concentrates that as you I mean you're using a blow torch
[28:15.300 --> 28:22.020]  so that's that's something that just seems now my question I'm gonna compound on that
[28:22.580 --> 28:30.100]  this torch I'm using is not like the map gas torch you see the crack heads using or somebody
[28:30.100 --> 28:34.500]  that you'd see in a shop welding something or maybe the kind of torch that attaches to the
[28:34.500 --> 28:40.420]  creme brulee torch yeah it's designed as a or a cannabis community people usually see yeah does
[28:40.420 --> 28:44.980]  this torch make it does this being like a cigar torch or a creme brulee torch or not a crackhead
[28:44.980 --> 28:51.220]  looking torch does this change the vibe slightly to you at least I think I think that just the it
[28:51.220 --> 28:56.900]  clicks it has the flame there's like you're heating up something just to smoke it it just
[28:56.900 --> 29:02.980]  looks like I understand that this is like not this is the same thing I'm doing just at an
[29:02.980 --> 29:09.940]  accelerated rate it just looks like drugs okay I like that and it's not I don't have a problem
[29:09.940 --> 29:16.500]  with it no yeah yeah it just looks like it okay I just don't know how much people on the inside of
[29:16.500 --> 29:25.060]  your culture like deep into it just don't realize that oh well if when you're putting up pictures on
[29:25.060 --> 29:33.860]  Instagram and like your rig's dirty or something like that like oh I'm doing my dabs now it's just
[29:33.860 --> 29:40.420]  like man you're just if you're gonna take a picture of something at least clean it up I agree with
[29:40.420 --> 29:47.300]  that I don't know man I agree with that there's a lot of things there's what you just said took my
[29:47.300 --> 29:54.580]  brain a couple of different places sure like part of the war on drugs over the last fuck 80 years
[29:54.580 --> 30:00.740]  is there was a lot of stigmatization that went with it and as far as like being a long-time
[30:00.740 --> 30:06.580]  member of the cannabis community like I got over the you think my clothes are silly you think my
[30:06.580 --> 30:11.380]  music is silly you think my hair is silly you think my earrings are silly like I get that when
[30:11.380 --> 30:17.700]  you look at me you judge me for lots of stuff adding something like a blowtorch to my cannabis
[30:17.700 --> 30:23.380]  consumption didn't bother me that much on an appearance level but I am more cognizant like
[30:23.380 --> 30:29.300]  when I'm out in the world and people are paying attention when I go to do a dab non-community
[30:29.300 --> 30:35.140]  members perk way up and become far more interested than if I pulled out a joint absolutely I could
[30:35.140 --> 30:40.180]  agree with that they're like what do you got there and the anti-pot crowd fucking loves to
[30:40.180 --> 30:47.620]  rail about concentrates and dabbing they uh they haven't figured out exactly how and why it's like
[30:47.620 --> 30:53.300]  other drugs yeah um but they know it looks like harder drugs and it's scary to people that aren't
[30:53.300 --> 30:57.540]  familiar with it and so they're running with it pretty hard yeah you know what I think those people
[30:57.540 --> 31:01.060]  that think that it looks like harder drugs that are on the news that are like it looks a lot like
[31:01.060 --> 31:06.420]  they're doing this kind of drug because they used to do that kind of drug and they know or they've
[31:06.420 --> 31:12.740]  just seen it in their town and it scares them because like there's epidemics on fucking all
[31:12.740 --> 31:19.940]  sorts of drugs that hit you know the east coast got ravaged by heroin uh yeah I mean coke came in
[31:19.940 --> 31:27.620]  and took over the whole country for a while there and then there's ecstasy and what's what's the
[31:27.620 --> 31:34.500]  meth is hitting like small towns right now big right now so so I I have extended family that is
[31:35.140 --> 31:40.980]  definitely fucked with that shit and it fucked them up sorry to drop a couple hard f-bombs
[31:41.860 --> 31:47.060]  it's just fuck it that's it's scary so you start seeing that stuff and you start seeing the
[31:47.060 --> 31:53.060]  lifestyle that they were in and it's like damn well it kind of looks the same as this dab rig
[31:53.540 --> 31:57.860]  and I completely understand that it's not but you start seeing some of the stuff that they were like
[31:57.860 --> 32:04.740]  smoking out of or whatever they were doing like meth is no joke so I just I I don't think that
[32:04.740 --> 32:11.140]  this is a gateway because I'm not even willing to gateway into dabs you know I'm not going to go
[32:11.140 --> 32:17.620]  back to drinking either though so I I don't know I'm a I'm a different breed you know I'm I'm
[32:17.620 --> 32:22.660]  willing to smoke because it's the right thing for me it keeps me healthy I appreciate that
[32:24.020 --> 32:30.100]  now it kind of does it unhealthy you either like there's that component to a lot of it too
[32:30.100 --> 32:35.700]  yeah yeah like that's the thing with me and booze is like the first couple of days that I'm having
[32:35.700 --> 32:40.820]  a drink or two or if I'm on a trip or something that aren't a problem it's a week later when I'm
[32:40.820 --> 32:46.900]  having half a bottle at night oh yeah yeah so I want to continue with the uh the dabs look like
[32:46.900 --> 32:51.540]  drugs thing uh you were saying earlier that we've got a mutual friend that smokes with a nectar
[32:51.540 --> 32:56.180]  collector um I'm going to describe the difference between the nectar collector and a normal rig a
[32:56.180 --> 33:01.300]  little bit here so with my rig it looks like I have got this is a it's called a hammerhead
[33:01.300 --> 33:07.300]  as a style of pipe so it is a can just imagine a small cylinder and then coming off that cylinder
[33:07.300 --> 33:11.620]  is a long mouthpiece that is flared open that fits your mouth in there just pretty cleanly so
[33:11.620 --> 33:16.180]  you don't have to make a little kissy face then coming off of the top of that is it looks like
[33:16.180 --> 33:22.660]  a bowl it looks like a pipe bowl it looks like a thimble on a 90 degree piece of glass you heat
[33:23.220 --> 33:27.140]  the thimble part and you put the dab in there then you put a carb cap on it and you smoke it
[33:27.140 --> 33:32.260]  just like you would any other pipe or bubbler I like a small dab rig I've talked about why like
[33:32.260 --> 33:37.780]  a small dab rig in several several episodes so this one looks like kind of like your basic like
[33:37.780 --> 33:42.500]  maybe your bubble crack pipe or just a basic bubbler for smoking bong or smoking flower yeah
[33:43.460 --> 33:49.140]  so with the the nectar collector it is just a straight tube it is straight and it may have water
[33:49.140 --> 33:53.540]  if it doesn't have water I call that a dab straw but it's just a straight tube it's also known as
[33:53.540 --> 33:59.940]  a drill and then instead of putting the dab onto the nail you leave the dabs in a tray or a glass
[33:59.940 --> 34:04.100]  dish something that kind of looks like similar to an ashtray kind of I see a lot of people dabbing
[34:04.100 --> 34:08.740]  straight out of their silicone container which I don't know how I feel about yeah but you heat the
[34:08.740 --> 34:12.100]  tip of that and then you press that directly into the concentrate then you inhale through the
[34:12.100 --> 34:18.820]  opposite end it works it's effective I prefer a rig is definitely the way I prefer to dab
[34:18.820 --> 34:24.100]  in your opinion does the nectar collector versus the dab rig does that look any different to you
[34:24.100 --> 34:29.220]  is that less drugs or just just as much drugs the the little straw thing looks pretty I mean
[34:29.860 --> 34:35.620]  his is yours is clean and his is not all right so that's something to do with it too okay like
[34:36.340 --> 34:42.500]  it's also you're using a creme brulee he's using like one of those blue torch like all right you
[34:42.500 --> 34:51.300]  know it's just I don't know I really think that for me it's the torch okay as we as you went
[34:51.300 --> 34:57.060]  through this thing it's like yeah I'm not mad at your little bong you know essentially that's
[34:57.060 --> 35:01.780]  yeah just a little bong that's all it is it's a bong for concentrate the curious looking little
[35:01.780 --> 35:06.500]  bowl like what kind of new bowl is that it's it's probably just the way it heats up to me
[35:06.500 --> 35:12.980]  okay just like wow that's that's excessive were the optics better when it was electric
[35:13.940 --> 35:20.740]  did you ever see the electronica I did but that I mean that's been so long ago I mean I'm yeah I
[35:20.740 --> 35:25.140]  don't even remember who I was back dabbing was brand new at that time when he was coming over
[35:25.140 --> 35:30.900]  with the email on the table oh yeah yeah yeah geez that seems like a lifetime ago it was
[35:31.540 --> 35:39.620]  we've evolved so far that was 200 episodes ago probably wow yeah man how the time flies huh
[35:39.620 --> 35:44.500]  time flies episode 400 it'll be episode 420 I can't believe you're at 400 already we just did
[35:44.500 --> 35:49.460]  300 yeah yeah it feels well 100 episodes ago yeah I mean it was a full 100 episodes ago but
[35:49.460 --> 35:53.460]  it feels like we just did 300 yeah once again thank you everybody for listening I know this
[35:53.460 --> 35:58.420]  is a rambly ass episode but I think the rambly episodes are super fun Mike's nodding his head
[35:58.420 --> 36:05.380]  I good radio voice that Mike head butting the mic for indication that you agree I go back and
[36:05.380 --> 36:08.740]  listen to the shows and I listen to most of the episodes listeners even the ones I'm on
[36:10.260 --> 36:16.100]  my favorite part is the like I'm usually alone when I listen to the podcast or like it work with
[36:16.100 --> 36:20.820]  headphones in or something and it makes me feel like I'm at the table hanging out with friends
[36:20.820 --> 36:26.420]  for a little bit which is really nice especially if you do a lot of alone time or a lot of in your
[36:26.420 --> 36:32.580]  head with the headphones on time right go ahead Clint I feel like I go 100% sorry go ahead I feel
[36:32.580 --> 36:37.460]  like the people that listen to the podcast I have developed a relationship like a friendship with a
[36:37.460 --> 36:42.180]  lot of people online with I only know them through the podcast some of them I get lucky enough to
[36:42.180 --> 36:45.780]  actually meet them in person like Aldridge came a little while back and I got to shake his hand
[36:45.780 --> 36:50.100]  and meet him I said a lot of people from the Indo Expo I get to meet a lot of those people
[36:50.100 --> 36:54.420]  but there's a thing that happens when you listen to 400 episodes of people they know us now like
[36:54.420 --> 36:59.140]  they know people remember shit that I said that I forgot I even said and they bring it up and I'm
[36:59.140 --> 37:04.340]  like how do you know that like oh yeah I have a podcast that I probably said that and I have I've
[37:04.340 --> 37:09.940]  since I listen to a lot of podcasts I see the same thing in other shows like when people come when
[37:09.940 --> 37:15.460]  comedians come I feel like I know them like we do know people but it's even we have tighter
[37:15.460 --> 37:19.700]  relationships with them just because of their podcast I feel like I know stuff about them and
[37:19.700 --> 37:23.700]  when they come it's like hey how you been how is I know some of my friends wives names because of
[37:23.700 --> 37:27.460]  their podcast I know their dog's name I know that one of my friends has to have an eye surgery
[37:27.460 --> 37:32.340]  because of his podcast when he comes I talk to him about that and so the people that listen have that
[37:32.340 --> 37:38.820]  they've developed that with us too definitely we're friends like we have bros and uh lady friends that
[37:38.820 --> 37:44.420]  aren't romantic what do you call bros that are females I'm trying to find a non-gender for that
[37:44.420 --> 37:48.660]  see that don't like that at all and chicks is really derogatory so let's try to get away from
[37:49.220 --> 37:55.300]  associate we have a bunch of friends of multiple genders it's 2019 so they could be fucking anything
[37:55.300 --> 38:02.180]  at this point I'm just saying bro weird bro weird yeah we have a lot of bro we're surfer boy oh yeah
[38:02.180 --> 38:06.340]  I get you what's up bro so bra I got a lot of bras watching the show man yeah I don't want to get you
[38:06.340 --> 38:12.740]  in trouble for something I said too so let's backpedal a little bit it's a nemo punk 15 to
[38:12.740 --> 38:16.100]  right no but it's great to have developed friendly relationships with the people that listen to the
[38:16.100 --> 38:19.780]  show I really like it uh some people I know what's going on in some people's gardens like there are a
[38:19.780 --> 38:23.140]  couple of people that I'll check on them if I haven't heard from them in a few days I'm like
[38:23.140 --> 38:26.980]  hey did you fix that shit yet because we've been checking on their garden for like two weeks trying
[38:26.980 --> 38:31.700]  to solve a problem and sometimes we'll get it fixed you know just through a few emails and so I feel
[38:31.700 --> 38:35.620]  like I know those people now and I want to check in and be like hey bro are those mites gone or
[38:35.620 --> 38:40.260]  whatever you know that's cool yeah yeah those are just people that we have developed relationships
[38:40.260 --> 38:45.860]  through the podcast onto social media man it's it's great that we have this platform
[38:47.060 --> 38:52.500]  that this is a thing that we're allowed to do this is a great freedom yeah allowed yeah this used to
[38:52.500 --> 38:56.980]  be pirate radio you know what I mean it really did this that used to be what this had but we made a
[38:56.980 --> 39:02.500]  fairly decent movie about it called pump up the volume like way back in the day yeah about the
[39:02.500 --> 39:08.580]  idea of having an open free communication platform like this and I actually made my
[39:08.580 --> 39:12.820]  niece and nephew go watch it they were both blown away by the whole concept of that being a movie
[39:12.820 --> 39:17.540]  and they're like I can remember us now and the internet yes none of that shit was around before
[39:17.540 --> 39:21.700]  yep I can remember clips of that movie uh when he had to hide the phone so that it could make
[39:21.700 --> 39:27.540]  him look like he was somewhere else and then the seven minute stretch yep good part of the movie
[39:27.540 --> 39:31.060]  I didn't check out that movie you guys I didn't see that that's your homework dude before we hang
[39:31.060 --> 39:36.740]  out again really really young christian slater yeah christian slater was good in that one like
[39:36.740 --> 39:41.620]  when he looks like he might have you know finished college a couple years ago and is still able to
[39:41.620 --> 39:47.940]  play a high school kid I'm gonna go home and watch Sandra Bullock in the net nice that should do the
[39:47.940 --> 39:53.860]  thing to me too like oh it's got a symbol in the corner of the web page no one will ever click that
[39:55.220 --> 39:59.060]  it's not just the only thing on the web page all right no one will click that
[39:59.860 --> 40:05.300]  oh shit I love movies like that where you get a good taste and flavor for like the world and
[40:05.300 --> 40:10.020]  the level of tech at the time and even a few years later it's like oh dude look at those idiots
[40:10.020 --> 40:14.820]  yeah we didn't have yeah the pirate radio we did not have the internet back then we couldn't do
[40:14.820 --> 40:18.660]  this and then we got podcasting and then they tried to stop podcasting with the patent troll
[40:18.660 --> 40:22.740]  thing yep and we fought that and got that off and now we're still going I said got that off that's
[40:22.740 --> 40:26.580]  kind of gross but we beat that and now we're still going podcasting is pretty amazing you're right
[40:26.580 --> 40:32.580]  and then the ability to uh just reach out for anybody to reach out to anybody nowadays is great
[40:32.580 --> 40:37.460]  there's no limit like I can access the president which I mean that's just probably that used to be
[40:37.460 --> 40:40.580]  the top of the tier when you try to talk about important people that you want to access now you
[40:40.580 --> 40:43.620]  just tweet him and he'll tweet back at you and tell you to fuck yourself if he doesn't like you
[40:43.620 --> 40:51.540]  it's kind of amazing it's the presidency was removed from that until very recently yeah I
[40:51.540 --> 40:57.460]  remember when twitter was like you could reach anyone except the highest tiers of government
[40:57.460 --> 41:02.020]  yeah but now you can now you can get anybody it's crazy now I can tell Will Smith great job on that
[41:02.020 --> 41:05.300]  movie I could tell another actor to go fuck himself I could tell some other actors that I
[41:05.300 --> 41:09.860]  loved her dress I could tell Greg Proops hey thanks for that great show and they'll reply to me
[41:09.860 --> 41:13.300]  like they actually respond and they say hey Jeff I'm glad you enjoyed the movie that we did make
[41:13.300 --> 41:16.020]  sure you check out the next movie I'm putting out you know like thanks for checking her out all the
[41:16.020 --> 41:19.140]  time Greg Proops would be like hey thanks for coming out to the podcast sorry that all the
[41:19.140 --> 41:23.860]  volunteers from the audience were whack like Proops will actually respond to me and stuff like it's
[41:23.860 --> 41:29.860]  this era this time period is great it's really exciting to be part of all that and having 400
[41:29.860 --> 41:34.660]  episodes in you got a leg up on anybody that's starting right now too I mean everybody can
[41:34.660 --> 41:41.460]  listen to this podcast and take this as an example out of like okay we we want to do a grow podcast
[41:41.460 --> 41:47.540]  this is this is a real niche like market you know there isn't like a whole lot of people that it's
[41:47.540 --> 41:53.060]  like you know I was thinking about growing marijuana today where should I start right so
[41:53.060 --> 41:57.700]  there's a lot more of that now though than there was when we started I got you and that that is
[41:57.700 --> 42:03.300]  happening and I think that things like this I I really think weed's gonna get to the place where
[42:03.300 --> 42:08.500]  it's almost like tomatoes where like we're headed towards craft brewery for sure you know what I
[42:08.500 --> 42:13.220]  mean like everybody can grow their own they will it'll be easy I compare it to like Mike said craft
[42:13.220 --> 42:18.900]  brewer brewery is probably a really good uh comparison I kind of think of it like uh music
[42:18.900 --> 42:23.860]  equipment and musicians there are different levels of musicians and different level of commitment and
[42:23.860 --> 42:28.420]  different uh aspirations when it comes to music just like there are when it comes to growing
[42:28.420 --> 42:33.060]  the equipment is overpriced you have to invest in a lot of it it takes a lot of time to get good at
[42:33.060 --> 42:37.620]  any of it I kind of think of it like a musician and that's kind of how it evolves and there's all
[42:37.620 --> 42:42.980]  there are always new young people coming in older people coming that want to become a musician I
[42:42.980 --> 42:48.340]  myself I ran this is random rant that fits right in uh it's midnight I just turned 40 years old
[42:48.340 --> 42:52.260]  right now for my 40th thank you guys thank you much thank you listeners that are telling me happy
[42:52.260 --> 42:56.900]  birthday I do appreciate that for my birthday I bought myself the expensive drum set that I've
[42:56.900 --> 43:02.020]  been staring at since I was a kid so there will be growers that come along that are youngsters
[43:02.020 --> 43:06.180]  that want to learn how to grow there will be people that have a medical need that their state
[43:06.180 --> 43:10.020]  just comes along that legalizes that want to grow then they're going to be guys that are 40 years
[43:10.020 --> 43:13.940]  old that just for their birthday they're going to say well it's legal now I got a little bit of
[43:13.940 --> 43:17.860]  money because I'm doing well in my old age I'm gonna fucking go buy a grow setup and start growing
[43:17.860 --> 43:21.380]  and they're going to want to find a podcast like this or like you're saying the other cannabis
[43:21.380 --> 43:25.060]  podcast so it's going to be a growing uh growing market I hate to call it a market because that
[43:25.060 --> 43:28.980]  sounds like I'm trying to capitalize too much but it's a growing there's always going to be a demand
[43:28.980 --> 43:35.060]  for this even after all 50 states legalized because eventually we'll have national legalization
[43:35.060 --> 43:39.620]  that's the goal right is legalization nationwide so that we can all possess consume and safely have
[43:39.620 --> 43:44.660]  access to our medicine once we get to that point we're gonna have everybody from every every single
[43:44.660 --> 43:49.380]  state is going to try to want to grow cannabis and then once that tapers off we still get those
[43:49.380 --> 43:53.460]  waves of folks like I was talking about the young kids that just turn old enough it's legal to grow
[43:53.460 --> 43:58.100]  when you're this age whatever the nation makes it 18 21 as soon as a bunch of people turn that age
[43:58.100 --> 44:01.460]  they're going to start growing we're going to get waves of that then you're going to get the
[44:01.460 --> 44:04.660]  midlife crisis guys is I guess what we're going to call them the 40 year old dudes that want to
[44:04.660 --> 44:09.220]  just do something new instead of buying a drum kit a bunch of guys are going to go buy run down
[44:09.220 --> 44:13.220]  to the hydro store and drop two grand yeah and just go learn it in the basement just like a lot
[44:13.220 --> 44:21.780]  of guys are going to do with the drums I mean it right now is like this DIY era of everything
[44:21.780 --> 44:29.060]  because I I I cannot say I don't know how anymore absolutely there is no no one can say that at all
[44:29.780 --> 44:34.980]  I it doesn't matter what you're doing there's a YouTube video for it yep it doesn't matter what
[44:34.980 --> 44:40.580]  you're doing there's going to be a podcast about it and somebody's put in 400 episodes into some
[44:40.580 --> 44:46.340]  niche thing that yes it's blowing up I mean comparatively to what it's been for the last
[44:46.340 --> 44:54.900]  150 years but I mean it's it's neat that we have access to this I'm really excited for
[44:57.780 --> 45:05.620]  what we can make happen like individuals you know what I mean like you put in 400 episodes I put in
[45:05.620 --> 45:11.780]  five you know uh Mike's helping out with 100 but he would have done zero on here without you here
[45:11.780 --> 45:18.420]  yeah I I said there's no way my podcast yeah I appreciate that yeah it's just you know hard work
[45:18.420 --> 45:23.380]  that's all I don't know getting older I start seeing it and I start respecting it more well
[45:23.380 --> 45:27.300]  thank you bro thank you uh there's there's some time at this table and at this podcast dude I
[45:27.300 --> 45:32.260]  burned out a macbook I had to replace the macbook because mainly all that old macbook did was a
[45:32.260 --> 45:37.140]  podcast it's your passion that's got 400 episodes I mean maybe six of those were me calling you and
[45:37.140 --> 45:42.260]  being like I want to do an episode on blank right and I wouldn't have made those phone calls had
[45:42.260 --> 45:47.060]  you not already done a couple hundred episodes on other shit there's one time when I was super sick
[45:48.020 --> 45:52.020]  I was just so sick I just couldn't I was like welcome to the show guys I got like six of my
[45:52.020 --> 45:55.940]  friends here and then you guys did a podcast without me basically I sat here and worked the
[45:55.940 --> 46:00.260]  knobs and pressed record on the computer and it was just six of my friends just fucking talking
[46:00.260 --> 46:04.020]  for me so that's pretty cool I think Mike and Jesse and Adam I remember if you were here never
[46:04.020 --> 46:11.300]  missed a Monday thing is huge like the amount of effort and dedication that that takes is kind of
[46:11.300 --> 46:15.940]  nuts well I don't plan on stopping you guys there's no reason to stop podcasting the computer
[46:15.940 --> 46:19.860]  works the table is pretty sturdy I feel good cannabis is going to just keep getting better
[46:19.860 --> 46:23.780]  and more legal everywhere we go so there's no need to stop very true we're definitely going to make
[46:23.780 --> 46:30.660]  it to 420 and then we're going to make it to 500 and from there the moon then a thousand is the
[46:30.660 --> 46:36.740]  goal after that right well we just keep going 757 that's a weird number I think it should be 701 is
[46:36.740 --> 46:43.060]  the goal 710 bro 702 is the goal I just every one of these is special Clint wants to go one step at
[46:43.060 --> 46:48.260]  a time I'm that's all I am dude one day at a time I like it stick with us you guys this is going to
[46:48.260 --> 46:52.580]  be a good show this is going to be a good future for us uh we got really rambly today but it's
[46:52.580 --> 47:00.180]  been a fun 400th episode holy crap how long do you think it's till uh America legalizes we've
[47:00.180 --> 47:04.260]  I don't think you think we got 10 years how many states are left Mike
[47:06.980 --> 47:08.660]  he's doing the math in his head you guys guessing
[47:12.880 --> 47:19.920]  there's maybe six eight states that don't have any
[47:20.400 --> 47:26.800]  laws in conflict with the federal marijuana law so I'm including CBD only states like Utah
[47:28.560 --> 47:35.280]  leaving six or eight states that still have 100 all marijuana is illegal including hemp
[47:38.880 --> 47:45.920]  so we're like 90 percent of the way yeah if we only got five left that's 90 that's pretty good
[47:45.920 --> 47:52.400]  that's 90 that's pretty good man we're I mean we're at the traditional tipping point now there's
[47:52.400 --> 47:59.680]  30 some medical states that allow medical access on one level or another for high THC content
[47:59.680 --> 48:06.880]  cannabis there's another half dozen CBD only states there's a couple of you can't smoke it
[48:06.880 --> 48:13.280]  but you can have it medically states there's eight or ten recreational states now usually this is the
[48:13.280 --> 48:18.080]  point with this many states in conflict with federal law where the feds go oh fuck all right
[48:18.080 --> 48:24.000]  fine we'll talk about it and then we spend a couple of years hashing out what the feds are
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.080]  going to end up doing in the house in the senate and then eventually something lands on the
[48:28.080 --> 48:34.720]  president's desk saying the feds are going to do this so that the states can go ahead and and do
[48:34.720 --> 48:40.320]  this like when we did this with alcohol when it became legal again there were a number of states
[48:40.320 --> 48:47.440]  that said the volstead act is ridiculous the 18th amendment's gonna go um we're we're repealing
[48:47.440 --> 48:52.240]  prohibition just here in colorado and then the feds were like well it's still illegal federally
[48:53.200 --> 48:57.760]  for a couple more years until enough states had come online and we've done this both ways like
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.080]  with highway funding the states were like we'll throw or the feds were like we'll throw you a
[49:02.080 --> 49:06.880]  bunch of money for highway funding but you have to jack your drinking age up and that's how they
[49:06.880 --> 49:13.200]  got the drinking age to 21 across the country i didn't know that yep yeah that's cool i mean i'm
[49:13.200 --> 49:20.800]  i'm happy that the drinking age is 21 because i'm so anti-alcohol that that's a good thing
[49:20.800 --> 49:27.360]  right i do like the idea of it falling into line like this like the dominoes are falling towards
[49:28.080 --> 49:32.960]  uh the end of this prohibition and honestly there's a ton of federal action right now there's
[49:33.280 --> 49:41.840]  um the federal cannabis caucus is a group of senators um that are all very pro-cannabis and
[49:41.840 --> 49:47.040]  they've been around for two or three years and they've been a pretty unimportant non-powerful
[49:47.040 --> 49:52.400]  group up until this year and they've got a lot more clout this year um the federal regulator
[49:52.400 --> 49:56.880]  the federal legislation that's been submitted so far this year is already getting a lot more press
[49:56.880 --> 50:01.840]  and a lot more attention more co-sponsors and that sort of thing than we've seen traditionally
[50:02.640 --> 50:06.640]  um we've never had a a president is
[50:08.720 --> 50:16.080]  uncommitted to a stated set of policies that's a pretty diplomatic way to say it
[50:16.800 --> 50:21.920]  um as we do right now so we don't really know if trump's going to show up tomorrow and be like
[50:21.920 --> 50:26.240]  make weed legal if i were going to edit this how would you have said that diplomatic statement
[50:26.240 --> 50:30.240]  how would i have said that yes diplomatically yes never had a fucking retard like this in
[50:30.240 --> 50:33.600]  office before okay just keep in mind i'm not going to edit that i was just curious what you
[50:33.600 --> 50:38.320]  would have said um but honestly there's you have no idea what what he's going to do from one day to
[50:38.320 --> 50:43.680]  the next and he's under a ridiculous amount of pressure and scrutiny right now because like
[50:43.680 --> 50:47.520]  everyone involved in his inauguration team is now in jail or on their way there or has
[50:47.520 --> 50:55.120]  pled guilty to several felonies um he's pretty cool so i mean what a gangster when you back
[50:55.120 --> 50:59.360]  people into a corner like that it's hard to tell what they're going to do and he seems like the
[50:59.360 --> 51:05.840]  type of dude who likes to say whatever it is to get you to stop yelling at him and i have a feeling
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.560]  that one of the crazy things he does when he's really backed into a corner is just like all
[51:10.560 --> 51:15.440]  right we're making weed legal by proclamation which isn't a thing the president can do but
[51:16.400 --> 51:21.440]  that hasn't stopped the orange potus before but if he does it we're all just going to go yay
[51:21.440 --> 51:27.280]  well if he did something like that immediately after the the members of the house and the senate
[51:27.280 --> 51:35.920]  that are committed to marijuana law reform would immediately dive on that um and use it as pressure
[51:35.920 --> 51:42.080]  to push actual legislation that would change the law forward i still think states should be allowed
[51:42.080 --> 51:52.560]  to not i mean i get that like i don't maybe not recreational it should be the state's choice
[51:52.560 --> 51:56.960]  because once we start going national then it's like the nation telling us what we're allowed
[51:57.280 --> 52:02.720]  the only thing the the feds would do would would be to say the states can pick and choose for
[52:02.720 --> 52:07.120]  themselves just for the sake of conversation where i'm at with why do people have to be sick to enjoy
[52:07.120 --> 52:15.040]  cannabis i guess i don't think it's so much that i think it's the state that's that's why we have
[52:15.040 --> 52:21.200]  states is so that way we can write those things in yeah so if the majority of a state says no we
[52:21.200 --> 52:26.880]  don't want that then that's their prerogative i don't think we should push anything on anybody
[52:26.880 --> 52:32.000]  and if you want to come to colorado i mean it's full i think most people are in agreement
[52:32.000 --> 52:36.240]  walls are already up so you guys are shit out of luck i'm sorry that's full yeah if you want
[52:36.240 --> 52:40.160]  to move here now you have to convince two people to leave yeah that's the rule yeah no you can come
[52:40.160 --> 52:44.560]  here but good luck finding somewhere to fucking park there just aren't any parking spaces left
[52:44.560 --> 52:51.840]  in colorado yeah yeah there's three years to build so let's say i want to just keep that i like this
[52:51.840 --> 52:57.440]  conversation we really got on a good roll here um so let's just say that we do legalize cannabis
[52:57.440 --> 53:02.080]  we create i'm in my mind it'll be a recreational thing they're not gonna uh they're gonna go full
[53:02.080 --> 53:07.280]  rec when if we go medical it has to get too involved in the medical system and it's not
[53:07.280 --> 53:12.160]  the way we're doing medical cannabis is not the way that any other medical program would work it's
[53:12.160 --> 53:18.720]  not like that i hate to crush anybody's idea of what a medical cannabis program is if you think
[53:18.720 --> 53:24.000]  about the way medicine works you have to go back and see your so you go to get a cannabis card
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.360]  a medical marijuana recommendation you go see the doctor you give him some money he goes here's your
[53:27.360 --> 53:32.640]  card have a great day any other medicine if i went to the doctor and i said my back hurts he said cool
[53:32.640 --> 53:36.400]  we'll give you some of these medicines to make your back feel better i gotta go back in 30 days
[53:36.400 --> 53:41.520]  and tell him how it worked if i've got any recovery if i feel worse he's gonna check my liver and
[53:41.520 --> 53:45.680]  kidneys if he's a good doctor and make sure that medicine's not fucking me up then he's gonna have
[53:45.760 --> 53:49.680]  a treatment plan a medical marijuana doctor goes oh you smoke weed for your problems or there's a
[53:49.680 --> 53:54.160]  card so i hate to crush the dreams it depends the low i mean even if we're just talking about
[53:54.160 --> 53:59.760]  colorado's system there are physicians and patients doing exactly what you're describing
[53:59.760 --> 54:06.320]  within our current system it's just it's not mandated most of the patients i just referenced
[54:06.320 --> 54:11.280]  are under the age of 18 right um it is much more scrutinized if you're a minor well then
[54:12.240 --> 54:17.600]  the other side of the that coin is patients aren't getting nearly what they do with every
[54:17.600 --> 54:22.080]  other class of drug like there's a number of things in cannabis that help with
[54:23.360 --> 54:30.880]  countless medical ailments but we're not refining or targeting or studying most of these
[54:31.840 --> 54:38.480]  effects and so we're just guessing and like i've had to go back i mean when i wasn't buying the
[54:38.480 --> 54:42.240]  level of product i buy now but i remember going back to the dispensary two or three times in a
[54:42.240 --> 54:49.360]  week playing with different stuff before i had learned enough about which strains affect my
[54:49.360 --> 54:55.760]  symptoms the best um what i'm really looking for as far as um cannabis for medical effects i was i
[54:55.760 --> 55:02.320]  was borrowing sativas and wondering why my pain wasn't any better um now i know but it took some
[55:02.320 --> 55:08.080]  time but like in an ideal world when i go to my physician and i say i've got pain and
[55:08.080 --> 55:13.360]  inflammation um the pain's being caused by inflammation in my neck it's pinching nerves
[55:13.360 --> 55:18.160]  what do you have to help me the doctor's going to give me a pill with what's taken and useful
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.480]  from the cannabis plant in it that's focused specifically on my problem same thing for
[55:22.480 --> 55:28.160]  epilepsy cancer whatever and those drugs aren't on the market now for a number of reasons but
[55:29.600 --> 55:35.680]  to make up for that lack of availability we've got the current system and it's just not tenable
[55:35.680 --> 55:44.080]  if this is legal coast to coast okay no so and what i was getting at is if we do go nationally
[55:44.080 --> 55:47.840]  legal it's going to be recreational for the reason that mike and i stated that was a long way to stay
[55:47.840 --> 55:56.160]  it but i agree uh so now we've got a recreational legal cannabis system in colorado it took three
[55:56.160 --> 56:01.920]  to five years to get that system figured out you know what i mean it the medical so the medical
[56:01.920 --> 56:06.160]  system was a train wreck when it started it was the wild west you could do whatever you wanted for
[56:06.160 --> 56:10.960]  seven eight years when the state refused to even look at it for seven or eight years and so it just
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.040]  went totally unregulated that's why cali's so fucked now that's why oklahoma is awesome right
[56:15.040 --> 56:22.000]  now also by the way so then we had the medical market come we already had that medical experience
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.560]  to build on but when the recreational markets opened up it was still a semi-cluster fuck it
[56:26.560 --> 56:33.120]  was done pretty well for who it was and what it was but it was a semi-cluster fuck when the national
[56:33.840 --> 56:39.600]  system does come from the day they say i'm going to sign this paper and then january 1st 2000 and
[56:39.600 --> 56:45.360]  whatever we're going to say 2020 just to be hopeful january 1st 2020 cannabis is legal you
[56:45.360 --> 56:49.600]  can open up a dispensary a recreational dispensary for people 21 and over anywhere in the united
[56:49.600 --> 56:55.920]  states of america ready set go how long do you think it'll take for that to actually be in place
[56:55.920 --> 57:00.240]  because we know that people if he says it in 2019 we're not going to be ready in 2020 it takes a long
[57:00.240 --> 57:06.000]  time you got to build rules areas start setting up regulations how long until we actually have
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.920]  a system that works is that a three-year process is that five or ten years it'll vary base state
[57:11.920 --> 57:19.760]  to state in places like colorado that already have a highly regulated um system that's already
[57:19.760 --> 57:27.360]  fully up and running um it'll only take us six months nine months to get all of our paperwork
[57:27.360 --> 57:31.920]  changed over and our accountants familiar with the new rules and shit we're just gonna have
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.520]  little procedural changes to make right a couple of compliance meetings maybe another two inspections
[57:37.520 --> 57:43.680]  to schedule now that the feds will be real busy for a couple weeks right but like we've already
[57:43.680 --> 57:49.280]  figured out most of it okay um places like do you think will kind of be the guideline do you think
[57:49.280 --> 57:54.160]  we qualify if you were gonna say we're already the gold standard okay the bench well i work with
[57:54.160 --> 57:59.040]  another state like it's not unknown that uh i do consulting for other states i've got one state
[57:59.040 --> 58:03.120]  dude that they refuse if colorado's done it they're like well then fuck it we don't like it
[58:03.120 --> 58:07.600]  they like want to reinvent the goddamn legalization wheel and it is the most frustrating thing ever
[58:07.600 --> 58:13.200]  there's a bunch of that out in the world where my god if someone else has done it you have to do it
[58:13.200 --> 58:19.120]  over it you drove me nuts when we were writing just the marijuana rules here um i called it uh
[58:19.120 --> 58:24.560]  the committee to discuss reinventing the wheel they like to meet every month and at the end of
[58:24.560 --> 58:29.040]  the meeting they go well fuck boys round it is i guess yeah that's exactly what i said in a group
[58:32.320 --> 58:36.320]  we're rolling the wheel in colorado we're 10 years ahead of you guys and you just don't want to play
[58:36.320 --> 58:41.680]  with us it's really weird but uh especially when it comes to cannabis you run into people who are
[58:41.680 --> 58:46.320]  like but what about the boogeyman yeah and it's like well we can talk about it and we can make a
[58:46.320 --> 58:53.360]  rule that prevents that but like it's in your head you know that right we're making a rule that people
[58:53.360 --> 58:59.200]  have to follow because of nonsense in your head and they'll go like yeah but it's important that's
[58:59.200 --> 59:03.600]  a lot of the cannabis industry that's a lot of those a lot of politics in general we're just
[59:03.600 --> 59:08.720]  mainly focused on cannabis i'm noticing that that is a lot of politics in general so let's
[59:08.720 --> 59:13.040]  jump back toward kind of where we were we're getting this legalization nationally uh colorado
[59:13.040 --> 59:16.640]  is the golden standard we've kind of set the rules people are going to follow our outline our
[59:16.640 --> 59:22.080]  guideline on how to do the national legalization rollout i've got a shitty idea on where a lot of
[59:22.080 --> 59:25.840]  that cannabis is going to come from that's i think there will be some sort of a national program
[59:25.840 --> 59:28.960]  something will come into place where there's a regulation of grows that it comes from somewhere
[59:28.960 --> 59:34.800]  that's government regulated we'll talk about that in the future um so other states we've got states
[59:34.800 --> 59:38.320]  like oregon and washington they've got a pretty good head start do you think they'll be online
[59:38.320 --> 59:42.480]  with this national program within just a year or so give or take if the if your state's already got
[59:42.480 --> 59:48.160]  an up and running program i can't see too many problems that it might have while it's up and
[59:48.160 --> 59:53.520]  running that would cause anybody that's six months already running biotrack or metric and i don't
[59:53.520 --> 59:57.360]  mean metric like the measuring system i mean metric the computer program system the marijuana
[59:57.360 --> 01:00:03.520]  enforcement tracking and other stuff system that we all have to log into and hate anybody using
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.920]  that i think they'll be a little bit ahead of the curve the only thing i'm thinking that's really
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:14.400]  going to slow people down is the local rules and zoning shit can really bog down the process
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:23.840]  um in colorado it took about three years to really hash out um the medical rules and that was after
[01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:28.880]  five years of mumbling about we need to do this then there was a good three years of actual debate
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:34.480]  before the rules got hammered out and then we had another year and a half of debate for rec rules
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.200]  i mean just a couple like a year and a half after we finished the med rules
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.200]  we did recreational and most places decided they wanted to completely reinvent the wheel
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:52.400]  they didn't want to base anything off of their existing medical rules um it was just a bizarre
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:57.520]  process but i think most places now have gone through at least some of that there's very few
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.920]  places that are really going to be starting from scratch here the thing that's going to take the
[01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:07.840]  longest is when the feds say we don't care anymore go ahead and let the states do what they
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.520]  want there's going to be a period of time where each state goes well what do we want and for the
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:19.280]  states that haven't moved on this issue yet if if they decide they want to go with legalization
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:24.000]  then they're going to have to pick well what type of legalization do we want do we want utah
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:31.120]  alcohol model where it's states run stores that are staffed by off-duty cops or do we want the
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.280]  colorado model where when you show up here with your duffel bag we give you two ounces of weed
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:39.760]  and a dab rig like which model do you want to go with each state maybe another year and a half
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.000]  while they hammer that shit out and then another year while they hammer out zoning rules so
[01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.920]  if trump said let's do it tomorrow you're looking at three years before your your salt lake city
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.880]  is driving past the dispensary on your work all right net jeb we were trying to convince people
[01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.880]  earlier not to drive to colorado to move here and you just said that everybody gets two ounces
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:06.560]  please don't encourage them hey that also costs eight thousand dollars you know unfortunately
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.000]  that's only it's only about 300 bucks if you want two ounces and you could be laced up off the weed
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:18.480]  and the dab rigs are cheap but like that that 300 square foot studio apartment is gonna run you 1250
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:23.680]  a month yeah it's gonna get expensive that will get expensive beyond everyone being able to smoke
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:30.640]  recreationally i think that it's gonna people that are in jail for this shit is fucking ridiculous so
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:37.040]  like that will be the best thing that like pushing non-violent cannabis offenses this is just
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:42.240]  expunge those yeah you just like oh you got hemmed up for growing a couple of times you know three
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:46.960]  strikes and you got screwed and it's like if you weren't stealing electricity and working with some
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:53.600]  sort of weird crazy distribution system yeah makes sense there's a lot of like when you look at the
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:03:00.400]  people that are only in jail for specific marijuana rule violations you can get that
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:07.680]  number pretty small because most of the people that actually end up in real trouble when the
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:15.120]  cop busts you for weed they bust you for weed and right and so it's while you were on parole or
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:26.880]  probation or stealing power or driving while whatever and so just when the feds change the
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:31.680]  rule if we decide to go ahead and let go anyone who's just got marijuana on their their record
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.360]  it's not going to do that much good what really helps is the expunging getting all of that off
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.600]  your off your record like san francisco's talking about doing now there's a couple of places that
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:46.800]  are already doing it i mean that's just huge for people to get that that little scarlet letter off
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:50.640]  your back especially when you're trying to apply for jobs and shit that's where i was headed a lot
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.000]  of the cannabis industry jobs if you've been in trouble for growing cannabis in the past you cannot
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.720]  be in the industry and that leaves honestly who's more og than the people that got caught growing
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.760]  weed in 1985 like they probably know more about herb than most people right and now they can't
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:09.200]  even work in the grow because they got caught i don't know about the rule the statute of
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:13.520]  limitations but people that have been caught for drug offenses and cannabis offenses are banned
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:17.920]  from the cannabis industry and they probably know a lot so we're blocking people that way so like
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:22.720]  mike says cleaning up that record we'll be able to let those people back into the industry um right
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:29.600]  now in colorado those people are diving on hemp jobs because it's just outside of the industry but
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:35.600]  your record doesn't matter there's no med when it comes to hemp absolutely i know a guy who actually
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.280]  is in that exact situation he's a pretty good hemp grower or he's a cannabis grower can't be in
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:45.840]  the industry runs a giant hemp farm the cannabis facebook page i run uh the biggest story i shared
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.920]  last week mike what's your cannabis facebook page called pablo for sensible cannabis laws i wasn't
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:54.480]  going to take that opportunity but there you go um the biggest story i shared last week the one
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:58.480]  that got the most attention was about a cbd processing plant that's going to be hiring like
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:04.560]  150 to 200 people um and half of the interest was like oh shit i don't need a badge for this
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:11.840]  um and that's huge for people that industry's blowing up right now uh getting a badge is super
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:16.320]  easy if you don't have those though so if you're dragging your feet on that it's like you print out
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:22.320]  a 12-page thing you pay 75 bucks you go to colorado springs you're done and that's it yep they take
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:27.920]  your finger color i'm sorry guys i forgot this is global um yeah the colorado marijuana here in
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:33.280]  colorado so it's pretty easy so look it up if you if you're interested in this industry it's blowing
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.520]  up right now yes it is so like get in now that's that's how i feel about it you know you don't have
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.800]  to smoke but you can work in these places and you know you probably end up smoking because you're
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:50.000]  going to be around it a lot but there are plenty of non-consumers in the cannabis industry i'm sure
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.520]  lots of them well there's money hungry people that don't smoke weed so people need jobs for sure
[01:05:55.520 --> 01:05:59.760]  people need jobs and just uh there are people that work at the cereal store that don't eat cereal
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.200]  you know what i mean they're people that work at the chip factory that probably don't like doritos
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.000]  yep losers i'm gonna be pissed if i find out a vegan's cooking my steak
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:12.480]  all right really no it was just a fun way to go with that
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:20.400]  vegan send hate to at nemo punk 15 i've got two there you go uh yeah i've got two final bullet
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.160]  points that i want to cover uh there's no way to segue into these just random things that i
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:31.440]  had written down as we start wrapping up the show here um i'm just making sure that okay cool um
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:37.520]  one thing i want to talk about is i was at a dispensary recently and a young man came it was
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.160]  cold outside and a young man came running from his vehicle into the dispensary and he opened the door
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:45.840]  and he walked in he shook his jacket off and he sat down and he patiently waited in line like
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:52.720]  anybody else should another person in the dispensary made a comment to me about how he was
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:56.960]  cheating the medical marijuana system because he looks like he's well-bodied and able to run into
[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:02.000]  the dispensary mike is shaking his head he already sees the bullshit this is me off so
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:09.040]  me too i wanted to politely tell people you don't have the right to decide who has a medical problem
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:14.640]  that validates them using cannabis to improve the quality of their life that young man has a mental
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.680]  condition that cannabis prevents him from hurting himself on a daily basis i know that person he's
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:23.680]  a friend of mine so it kind of pissed me off that that person said that about him that person has
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.320]  come a long way in their life and cannabis did it without cannabis that dude would have killed
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:33.120]  himself to be quite frank he would have killed himself a long time ago i've been his bud tender
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:38.000]  at multiple dispensaries he used to come to a dispensary mike and i ran in 2008 so when that
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.120]  guy said that about him i was like yes yes i was like so good i wanted to yell at that guy and be
[01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.440]  like you're fucking wrong dude just because you have a cane and you walk with a limp doesn't make
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:52.160]  you any more of a valid patient than that young man he can run he can lift weight but his struggle
[01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:58.000]  is internal and you can't see that you literally even doctors can't glance at you and diagnose you
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:02.640]  right and you see this outside of the cannabis industry too like i just saw something on
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:09.680]  facebook about this happening to just a woman with a disability that's not obviously obvious
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:15.280]  when you glance at her walking across the parking lot but it drives me nuts in the cannabis space
[01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:26.240]  because there's a million reasons um that people take cannabis medically and like i'm in physical
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:34.320]  pain a lot say nine days out of ten my pains at a five or better never or almost never does that
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:39.440]  affect my walking people that know you i know you i see you on a regular basis i can see it yeah but
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:43.120]  people that don't know you people see me walking in the store i'm just another giant guy walking
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.400]  into the store your hips move differently when you're hurting you're out of rhythm but i only
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.480]  know that because i walk next to you on a regular basis you know i've known each other a decade yeah
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:56.000]  but you can't see it the first person i ever helped get their medical marijuana card is kind
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:03.840]  of the person that i credit with really starting me on my cannabis advocacy um they have ms and
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:08.400]  some days you can be like oh fuck dude what's wrong with him like at a distance you can tell
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:16.000]  in other days you can't tell at all he's young he's healthy he's fit uh it doesn't make sense
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.320]  at a glance why he's got um a handicap placard in his windshield um the last time me and him
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:28.720]  went to a concert at red rocks he felt super guilty when i was like dude you're driving and
[01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:33.360]  he was like what do you mean and i was like fucking handicap placard dude we're going all
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.800]  the way to the top we're parking in a good spot we're walking 15 feet to our seats like if we try
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:43.360]  to do this red rocks the other way you're not going to make it through the first act you'll be
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:47.440]  too tired to keep your head up and i'll have to call people to help me get you back to the car bro
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.560]  and he felt guilty about using it for himself and then halfway through the show he was like
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.200]  fuck i'm so glad you suggested this i would be dead if we tried to walk here in this heat
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.160]  but people that watch this park and watch us get out of the car and watch us walk to our seats
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.760]  i'm sure there were a number of people that were like fucking cheaters right right really yeah yeah
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:11.520]  i don't see that i see because you're a compassionate person and not an asshole but
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:16.640]  there are some assholes out there that saw that young man that who's a veteran who's been to war
[01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.520]  and fucking is a serviceman and has ms and they fucking watched that dude walk and couldn't see
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.080]  his limp or see his struggle and they judged him so that's what i'm talking about you can't see it
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:30.400]  uh my claim to fame i've got blown out knees as part of why i've got a marijuana cart i i hit my
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.040]  knees on the dash in a car accident also i've got some stomach problems you don't hear a lot about
[01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:38.960]  my stomach problems i don't talk about it a lot nobody cares nobody wants to hear me cry that my
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.840]  tummy hurts but that is a lot of my medical marijuana condition it helps with my stomach
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.160]  tremendously you can't see that can you can you tell right now by looking at me how does my stomach
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:53.040]  feel do i need to fart am i hungry yeah no idea yeah sometimes it hurts like someone's putting an
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.760]  ice pick in uh just to the my right side of my belly button it feels like they're putting an ice
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.280]  pick in there and then kind of pointing it up a little bit and then after it really starts to hurt
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.720]  it goes straight down and i've had a camera in my throat i've had a camera in my butt there's no
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:13.360]  reason why but if i consume enough cannabis constantly that doesn't happen that's awesome
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:18.640]  yeah yeah i mean i'm glad it sucks right it's good that we've got a cure that we found a patch for it
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:23.920]  that it doesn't hurt so yeah a pretty easy cure too it's not it's not like fucking radiation for
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:29.520]  cancer and the side effects from nice and bad yeah and you start a podcast for that's right
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:34.800]  that is right these side effects but my point is you guys don't and i'm sure that nobody listening
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:39.200]  to the show here is going to judge anybody based on their appearance based on their cannabis needs
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.360]  but share that with the world don't let people judge people just because that young man ran into
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:48.480]  the store judge less that dude's got issues that you can't see he's he do i don't know if i should
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:53.280]  talk about that dude's things he may hear this but he's got struggles we detail it enough yeah
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.200]  he's got struggles and we don't need to fucking judge him and that's probably even worse if that's
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.080]  why he fucking struggles in the world because people are judging him okay we're just gonna
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:07.440]  rant now um i saw something funny in the news this is sadly funny uh this is you were just
[01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:10.640]  talking about the warehouse that was hiring and i visioned a warehouse and it brought me back to
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:18.480]  this news subject um there are a few taco spots in colorado springs where i love to eat dude i love
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.160]  to eat at all these little crappy taco spots they've got a burrito supreme and some french
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.160]  fries with cheese and guacamole i am in dude it'll be nice and late i'll be coming home from a show
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:32.080]  and that's the perfect spot to stop and get some snacks um a few weeks ago one of the taco places
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:35.760]  was closed i was like well i'm just going to venture over to the other taco place of the same
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:40.800]  name just a few blocks away and that taco place was closed as well i was like what's going on with
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.320]  all my taco shops and i mentioned it to a friend i'm like dude you didn't know that all the taco
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.880]  shops by that name got shut down by the local law enforcement because they were all laundering money
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:53.680]  for a drug cartel and i was like that's why they made the best burritos on the planet for like six
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:58.000]  bucks you'd be like i want a burrito and they're like six dollars no tax just six dollars you're
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:04.320]  like that's weird already but they'd be like six dollars and you'd get a burrito that was the size
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.800]  of like a watermelon you'd be like that's a burrito and i couldn't eat the whole i'm a big
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.560]  dude and i couldn't finish that burrito and i get the burrito with french fries and cheese and
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:16.960]  guacamole it was like 13 bucks for all of it you can get a horchata with it for 15 bucks dude you
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:23.200]  set up they were a straight up front for a drug cartel just cleaning up all the money today bro
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:28.080]  today on the news you're smiling because i think you saw the same article it's so funny uh there
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.720]  was a giant warehouse near them that just recently got raided because they were not ordering anything
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:37.920]  that they were claiming they were ordering they were writing off tax orders saying we ordered
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:42.320]  like this many tortillas and this much food for this many restaurants they're connected you're
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:45.920]  talking about the distribution warehouse for these restaurants they finally just got around
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.160]  to busting the warehouse yeah yeah they were only delivering to these taco shops but they
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:53.840]  were acting like they were supplying all of colorado springs with food for preparation
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:14:00.160]  but it was just one place so they were just so they this whole bus stems from a dude paying
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:05.840]  for a car that costs more than ten thousand dollars in cash up in wyoming like three years ago
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:11.440]  tight he he you know that if you deposit or spend more than ten thousand in cash they have to file
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:15.440]  paperwork they filed the paperwork and they looked at the dude they were like so he's an
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:22.640]  illegal alien who lives in the next state over curious why he drove to wyoming i mean everyone's
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:30.800]  favorite destination they had a blue one there um right yeah that blue chevy tahoe but uh the
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:35.040]  story gets funnier and funnier when they first busted the taco shops there were a bunch of poyos
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.760]  hermanos jokes yeah and now that they've busted the distribution chain everybody's like oh fuck
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:44.560]  dude did vince gilliam know but there there's rumor that they have attached it to el chapo so
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:50.480]  i was eating el chapo veggie burritos nice yeah yeah thanks el chapo yeah i loved that the el
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:58.240]  chapo trial took place this is a weird tangent during the wall debate um because every day
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:04.000]  in the press you would hear reasons for and against building a large physical barrier on
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:10.240]  our southern border and then at night after the trial adjourned for the day you would read how
[01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:15.520]  major drug cartels ship drugs and never ever did these two conversations meet
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.640]  i'll let listeners go research their various ideas and things involved oh wall won't stop that
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.600]  shit there's a catapult yeah the catapult's fucking awesome there's a drone the wall doesn't
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:34.720]  stop anything no except your ability to own the land that's under it that's like a speed bump
[01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.720]  that's all it really is for a cartel smuggler it's not even that it's just a thing
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:46.400]  like they're sending fucking cocaine here by the ton and submarines yeah they're in the entire train
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.080]  is drugs the only thing that's not drugs is the fucking wheels in the engine
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:55.920]  and we think the wall's gonna stop the train the airplane the submarine what the fuck
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.560]  oh it's the semis bringing it in too that just not all of them get checked as well as other ones
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:07.280]  like why tape one kilo to a person when you could tape a million kilos to one train
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:15.520]  yeah it's a it's a pretty scary proposition there well now that you uh can't make any money off
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:21.200]  importing cannabis you gotta up your ante do you think that's what happened do you think that that's
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:27.840]  why there's i don't know if things got worse in mexico or not i don't know things have gotten
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:35.440]  stranger um the cannabis farmers are still farming drugs for the most part they're just
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.520]  not farming cannabis anymore and the traffickers are still trafficking drugs they're just not
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:44.800]  trafficking cannabis anymore right um and that has had some weird repercussions all the people
[01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:51.920]  that used to make money on weed that are making money on weed now um are doing other various
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:57.040]  things to make money and like that was one of the weird negative consequences that we kind of knew
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:17:04.800]  to expect but didn't like to talk about um is you're looking i bring this up a lot online but
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:13.600]  best guess for what the black market was coast to coast before legalization is 30 to 60 billion
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:20.080]  dollars a year just us domestic and that's americans buy 30 to 60 billion dollars for
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:25.360]  the cannabis each year and up all of that underground you gotta imagine just how
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:31.920]  like if you imagine a root system how far those fucking roots go to do 35 to 60 billion dollars
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:37.920]  a year to put that in something that you can picture cosmetics are 35 billion a year so like
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:45.840]  all shampoo and eyeliner and shit is 35 billion what is apple worth i don't know i'm just curious
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:49.200]  i figured somebody in the room would know that not off the top can you compare that i'll google
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.440]  if when you guys keep talking i'll find a company that is worth 35 billion dollars just we have so
[01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:59.920]  it's a comparison that's how i got the cosmetics is because i looked up like us domestic sales 35
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.880]  billion or whatever i can't imagine cosmetics with as much bullshit as my wife and kids buy
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.880]  well i think all the different stores that you that you interact with on a monthly basis say
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.360]  that sell cosmetics in one form or another from the gas station that sells just blistex
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:26.000]  to the sally may yes sally's that sells all that specialty hair dye shit like all different levels
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:32.720]  the manufacturing warehouses the distribution trucks and as much as all of that is like almost
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:39.040]  it's all underground minimum of underground weed and that's the minimum almost you said 30 to 60
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:46.720]  so i mean we might not expect 60 but we could probably say 45 it's 45 billion dollars stretches
[01:18:46.720 --> 01:18:52.560]  way out apple's worth a trillion that's not there are 12 zeros in that i think i saw i already went
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:55.840]  past it because it blew my mind i didn't want to focus too much i'm looking to see what netflix is
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:01.120]  worth now that's a lot of zeros did 12 zeros yeah damn dude i got i got a whole bunch of zeros in
[01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:07.600]  my bank account too they're on the wrong end of the ones though yeah yeah they're all in the
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:16.400]  account number yeah i got no numbers in that account too that's great when when we move this
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:22.080]  market into the legal market we a lot of places specifically excluded people that had gotten in
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:27.040]  trouble or were overly involved previously and so all those people got fucked out of a job
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:33.520]  and it did some weird shit like i was looking at arrest numbers the other day in colorado cannabis
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:41.680]  arrests are down like 6500 a year but the number of people we arrest each year has gone up now some
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:47.440]  of that's the cop having free time now but some of that's other shit too right i'm not saying weed
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:54.000]  cause crime go up but these are things that are happening so uh this is a ramble cast i've kind of
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:58.880]  wondered hoping to get a helmet if no if you're wearing a helmet we didn't make it but the the
[01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:04.720]  lack of the black market having the money of weed yeah i get you no it definitely up your game now
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:10.240]  huh i gotta go i gotta go make my 50 bucks because my family's hungry well what do i do i don't know
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.960]  man go fucking steal something from sears and it got weird because people automatically assume like
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:19.440]  well the weed dealer just sells coke now and it's like well okay they could switch which drug they
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:28.240]  sell but there aren't an equal number of consumers of any other drug compared to cannabis right like
[01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.680]  unless this mythical person opened a liquor store something attached to this i kind of want to segue
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.720]  off of that because i've had this question for a little while do you think now that herb cannabis
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:42.800]  is legal and kind of just out in the open it's just like drinking a beer in a lot of places
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.400]  nobody cares anymore if you're in colorado and you smell weed you don't even hesitate anymore
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:51.120]  in a lot of places when you smell weed you gotta go someone's smoking some reefer like in colorado
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:55.600]  it's just what it fucking smells like now yeah do you think somebody's stoking some reaper yeah
[01:20:55.600 --> 01:21:00.080]  you just smell what like the little dab pen smells like when you walk out of there yeah
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.520]  they walk out of the bathroom it's like all right i guess i guess you're going for that
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:10.880]  do you think that that has made uh cannabis less desirable for the rebel kids and now they're going
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:15.920]  straight for something different because back in the day it was kind of it was i don't know there
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:20.160]  was this different feeling of like yeah i'm fucking smoking a bowl while i'm driving i totally shouldn't
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.520]  be doing this and now it's just like you still shouldn't be doing that don't smoke a bullet
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:28.560]  smoking a joint while i'm walking down the mountain that's pretty cool it was
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:35.760]  that sounds amazing let's do that okay with the dog and a pretty lady i'm just responsible now
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:41.520]  blue haired lady don't smoke and drive it definitely was a rite of passage when we were
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:47.040]  younger yeah there's a thing going around now that's like in the 80s it was beer in the 90s
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:53.120]  in the 2000s it was weed and now it's getting vaccinated but let's not do that on this podcast
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:01.040]  it definitely was a like especially when we were teenagers like the first was did you steal a beer
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:06.640]  from your parents yet then it was you snuck a cigarette from somebody yet and then it was have
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.920]  you found weed yet yep and i don't know about you guys but like my first weed was literally
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.880]  fucking thrown at me in seventh grade while i was at school in the hallway like i was sitting there
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:22.240]  and was pelted in the chest with a bag of weed that literally fucking happened mike that's a
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.560]  story we're gonna have to have in full detail here on this podcast if not tonight in the very near
[01:22:26.560 --> 01:22:31.600]  future but like i didn't even have to seek out that rite of passage it was just sort of like i
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.440]  woke up in line for the roller coaster yeah it's like you're just standing somewhere and your
[01:22:35.440 --> 01:22:38.320]  friends are smoking a joint somewhere you're like where did the weed come from like are you gonna
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:43.920]  hit this and you're like well yeah i'm one of you guys i'm gonna smoke that weed but it it definitely
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:48.960]  was a rite of passage and that's going away slower and slower that's one of the comparing contrasts
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:54.000]  with the netherlands that people have brought up a lot is they have far less um teenage and young
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.040]  adult drug use period and cannabis use even though they have stores that sell cannabis to
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:04.080]  18 year olds and it's because it's not that interesting how long do you think till walmart
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:10.480]  has cannabis currently at walmart you can't buy cannabis cannabis but you can buy a puff co peak
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:16.080]  which is a vaporizer for smoking cannabis concentrates you can currently buy a volcano
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.440]  vaporizer which is pretty sure that's just the walmart online now uh yeah it's on the walmart
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:26.400]  online store but you can find a puff co peak and a volcano vaporizer you can find an oil slick pad
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:30.880]  you can get dab tools there and uh last time i saw them they were in the impulse section at the
[01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:34.640]  checkout line the funniest thing is they're right next to the magic the gathering cards so if you
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:38.800]  want to go home and play some magic the gathering and take some dabs know your consumer that's the
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:44.800]  truth i'll play the magic the gathering but no dabs please okay i uh no i'm just asking like
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:51.760]  is it gonna be immediately after we legalize it as like nationally like it'll be like time
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:57.200]  they'll be like all right these will be on the shelves in like months there's that first group
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:03.280]  of people that has to go it's legal now man yeah you know what i mean but like the generation that's
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:09.360]  just a year or two younger than that guy they don't like it's no longer a brass ring for them
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.400]  to wear at all it's just something that's dumb that older people do i feel walmart may be a
[01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  little too connected they have their roots are too deep they're uh they may be a little religious
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:23.680]  or a little churchy or a little too goody two-shoes to actually go ahead and booze yeah yeah
[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:29.680]  perfect that's that kind of supports my my point they're they're not for the camp they may be they
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:35.520]  may lose more business by selling cannabis yeah but then how many people are they going to lose
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:39.120]  if they say we support cannabis they're one of the largest they don't need to change anything
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:43.040]  honestly walmart's face that we're just because we're talking about walmart this has come up a
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.120]  million times with walmart and they just stare the world down and go fuck you it's cheaper here
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:51.520]  like when do you remember when that everybody was fired up because walmart puts all the mom and
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:56.880]  pop people out of business or yeah everybody cared for a while and then it was cheaper at walmart
[01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.840]  until they didn't want to go to target best buy king supers and barnes and noble on one trip and
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.520]  they went to best buy and got everything there yeah as long as you can avoid the people out
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:08.480]  front trying to get your signature for some random shit every week you're just fine
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:14.720]  but i i really don't think we'll see cannabis sold at walmart or the gas station or anything
[01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:19.200]  like that for at least the next 15 20 years and who wants to buy that go to a dispensary go to
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:25.600]  over to apothecary and get some good shit yeah now but i mean it's coming i mean i it's it's just
[01:25:25.600 --> 01:25:30.400]  like alcohol they didn't have that in the 30s they didn't have it in stores and i get that there was
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:36.720]  already like a way to get it and we lost bars and all this stuff so when it finally becomes legal
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.960]  there will be maybe specialty shops like the smoke shops you know maybe it'll be like liquor
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:49.040]  stores you know the same thing but they do sell liquor at like sam's club has it we're definitely
[01:25:49.040 --> 01:25:54.400]  headed to a place in the not so distant future where you can get really mediocre marijuana
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:26:00.880]  products it just a convenience store and we're definitely headed that direction i think it's
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:09.600]  inevitable you can already buy cbd hemp flower at very many head shops so yeah and i i see it
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:14.960]  getting into walmart because walmart cares about their shareholders and as soon as the shareholders
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:19.680]  see oh shit we're gonna make all sorts of money that's i mean that's all walmart is it's just
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.640]  money for an organization that size it would just be a small sideline item but like they carry all
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:28.080]  kinds of shit they only make a few percentage points on and it's all those shirts small
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.920]  percentages some of it all those small percentages add up to a big big percentage my last bullet
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.720]  point that i've got written down here uh just part of what we were talking about earlier i feel like
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:44.960]  uh i can see a difference in this town in our town of pueblo just in the few years that cannabis has
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:50.720]  been here we have got some of the world's if not uh some of the country's largest if not the world's
[01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:56.080]  largest legal cannabis production indoor and outdoor here in pueblo colorado uh people like
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:27:02.240]  to deny that shit's on people back to work that yes and you can see it in our community uh we have
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.840]  i used to complain about the food i still complain about the food options we're getting
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.080]  more better restaurants here we're getting some good food options here and i think that a lot of
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.040]  the cannabis money is bringing that here more people are coming here with a more open mindset
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.320]  more money is coming here more educated type of ideal is coming here this used to be known as
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.400]  being kind of a a steel mill town where you can come get your ass kicked and drink a lot of beer
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:29.680]  when i moved here a decade ago absolutely it was it was still very much a steel town but we hadn't
[01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:36.160]  had a thriving steel industry for 30 years at that point right well the the steel mill is still where
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.160]  most of the people a lot of the people have some roots that's why a lot of the people are here is
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:45.200]  that steel mill and that steel mill branches out to several other uh companies and i think this guy
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.160]  right here has probably worked for several of them yeah i've worked for a couple of places i've worked
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:56.640]  for the steel mill itself and then i worked for the uh a place that they were supplying right so
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.160]  and yeah so that mill does a lot of stuff here and it's still got this town kind of had that
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:04.960]  mentality it's hard working let's get your hands dirty 24 7 then go to the bar right after work
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.400]  and get shit faced and then get in a fight and then go right back to work tomorrow like nothing
[01:28:08.400 --> 01:28:14.320]  fucking happened uh but i see that the cannabis is making uh it's changing it it's it's a little
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:18.240]  gentler we're getting a little more culture we've got an art walk now we're getting a little where i
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:22.560]  see a lot of evolution and i think a lot of the money a lot of the intellect is coming from this
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:26.960]  cannabis evolution it's bringing a great mindset it's making people want to work together people
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:31.840]  that would have never been in the same industry or working together now people like everybody wants
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:35.840]  to work in the cannabis industry so you got the guy in the grateful dead shirt next to the guy in
[01:28:35.840 --> 01:28:39.840]  the tupac shirt next to the guy with the juggalo shirt all hanging out in the trim room all listening
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:44.320]  to the joe rogan podcast all listening to grow from your heart all having a good time so i just
[01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.840]  i see a difference in this town it's more peaceful we've got some money now we've got
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:51.920]  some food options the potholes aren't as bad i know that sounds crazy but they're filling
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:58.240]  potholes in this town pueblo was smart we the people that were in charge of allocating that
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:05.600]  money knew that they couldn't fund long-term repeat shit with it like you can't hire cops
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:09.840]  because you're gonna need cops this year and next year and two years and five years down the road
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:14.880]  and anything that reoccurs like that you can't count on cannabis because you never know if the
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:20.240]  next president president is going to go nuts and enforce a closure or something which is why like
[01:29:20.240 --> 01:29:25.680]  teachers aren't getting funded with the shit either but knowing that they decided to fund
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:30.000]  improvement projects the people like you and me would actually care about so like a couple of
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.560]  schools got sidewalks where they didn't have fucking sidewalks leading to the school a couple
[01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.640]  of kids got uh scholarships from cannabis money a couple of thousand kids in pueblo now have
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:47.280]  received um two thousand dollars a year from our cannabis taxes so that they can go to college or
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:51.360]  to help pay for their college it's not like two thousand dollars is going to cover all the tuition
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:56.480]  but it fucking helps a lot helps looks helps out a bunch in like the community college though yeah
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:00.720]  it's there's some weird restrictions on it but like if you're a local high school kid and you
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:07.520]  want to go to either the local community college or csup um it's two grand no questions asked no
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:12.560]  gpa required it's just because you're a local person this money's available and i know several
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:19.200]  students that have used that money to stay in school but these projects actually help the road
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:23.920]  repairs help the the little improvements around the community help like if you look at the list
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:29.840]  of projects like there were some golf improved golf area golf course improvements i don't know
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.400]  why the word course left my head for a minute because you don't ever go to it but yeah i never
[01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:37.920]  use that and so i was like well that's dumb why are we doing that and then i kind of looked at
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:43.440]  the demographics and i'm like well pueblo's got a pretty heavy older population and they all love
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:48.560]  that shit the golf courses here are always packed when it's warm yeah like by all means make that
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:54.240]  five percent better so that they're five percent happier let's go ahead that shit's helping all
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:59.360]  over colorado we're getting better entertainment here as well because of it i think we're since
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:03.840]  we have a different demographic here a little more money brings a little more uh different
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.520]  demographic which brings more options for entertainment we can spend a couple more bucks
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.520]  on a better band to come a better comedian to come and it's happening so i see a difference
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:18.000]  i usually hear people that bring up this the specific thing in a negative way but i really
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:24.800]  like it like i grew up in colorado and whenever we would travel before legalization when people
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:31.120]  would say hey where are you from if you said colorado they'd go oh do you ski yeah and i don't
[01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:36.640]  or do you hurt me a lot when i was little so i was never a fan and it was always like
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:41.600]  annoying that people would ask me if i did this thing that my state was known for that i hated
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:47.360]  um and i'm happy when people like oh the legal weed place and i'm like yeah feel free to ask
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:51.520]  questions i'll tell you all about it yep um but i know a number of people that are annoyed
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:57.680]  with that change but i like it it's beautiful clint it looks like you got something you want
[01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:02.800]  to say but you're not sure if you should no it was it was kind of piggyback off and what he was
