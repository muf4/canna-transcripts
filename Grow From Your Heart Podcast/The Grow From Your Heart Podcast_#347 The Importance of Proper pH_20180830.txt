[00:02.360 --> 00:04.660]  Welcome to the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04.660 --> 00:08.260]  It's time for episode 347 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:08.260 --> 00:12.160]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:12.160 --> 00:13.460]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:13.460 --> 00:14.720]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:14.720 --> 00:17.180]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:17.180 --> 00:19.100]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone
[00:19.100 --> 00:21.860]  who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:21.860 --> 00:24.140]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:25.300 --> 00:27.340]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:27.340 --> 00:29.700]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:29.700 --> 00:31.220]  This episode of the show is brought to you
[00:31.220 --> 00:33.500]  by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:33.500 --> 00:36.320]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[00:36.320 --> 00:39.080]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[00:39.080 --> 00:42.300]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:42.300 --> 00:44.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, roll up a fat spliff,
[00:44.540 --> 00:47.380]  pack up a fat bowl, put some fresh water in the bong,
[00:47.380 --> 00:50.140]  turn on that vaporizer or start heating up that dab nail,
[00:50.140 --> 00:52.060]  because it's time for a fresh episode
[00:52.060 --> 00:53.980]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:57.540 --> 00:59.400]  Welcome to the show, podcast world.
[00:59.400 --> 01:00.860]  You know I like to start these episodes off
[01:01.500 --> 01:02.940]  by letting you know what I am smoking on.
[01:02.940 --> 01:04.740]  I just got back from the dispensary
[01:04.740 --> 01:06.020]  and I picked up something new.
[01:06.020 --> 01:09.380]  I grabbed some Cherry Chem Nectar from Green Dot Labs.
[01:09.380 --> 01:12.420]  This is cherry pie kush and chem four together.
[01:12.420 --> 01:14.900]  The flavor on the packaging is described
[01:14.900 --> 01:17.660]  as dark black cherry, baked pie,
[01:17.660 --> 01:20.500]  grape-chewable vitamins, and acetone.
[01:20.500 --> 01:23.220]  I get the dark black cherry immediately.
[01:23.220 --> 01:24.280]  When you open it and smell it,
[01:24.280 --> 01:26.100]  that's what you smell, in my opinion,
[01:26.100 --> 01:27.180]  that dark black cherry.
[01:27.180 --> 01:30.300]  Then when you hit it, you get that dark black cherry flavor
[01:30.740 --> 01:31.580]  on the inhale.
[01:31.580 --> 01:33.660]  The baked pie, yeah, maybe on the exhale
[01:33.660 --> 01:35.300]  as the smoke goes over your tongue,
[01:35.300 --> 01:37.180]  you'll get that baked pie flavor.
[01:37.180 --> 01:39.520]  The grape-chewable vitamins may be
[01:39.520 --> 01:41.940]  what they're describing this aftertaste as.
[01:41.940 --> 01:44.060]  There's a unique aftertaste.
[01:44.060 --> 01:45.060]  It's kind of lemony.
[01:45.060 --> 01:48.460]  It kind of almost tastes like dish soap to me.
[01:48.460 --> 01:49.600]  It almost tastes a little bit like
[01:49.600 --> 01:52.160]  if you had too much cilantro in a salsa
[01:52.160 --> 01:54.260]  and it gets that dish soap sort of a flavor.
[01:54.260 --> 01:56.740]  It's kind of got that aftertaste going on to me.
[01:56.740 --> 01:59.220]  I am not sure if I enjoy it or not.
[01:59.220 --> 02:01.140]  The high from the Cherry Chem Nectar
[02:01.140 --> 02:04.740]  went straight to my arms and my shoulders and my back.
[02:04.740 --> 02:07.540]  I did not get any sort of a head change from this.
[02:07.540 --> 02:09.980]  I don't know if you could tell how clear my head is,
[02:09.980 --> 02:12.980]  how clearly I'm speaking, how un-high I am,
[02:12.980 --> 02:15.440]  but my arms definitely got a little jello-y.
[02:15.440 --> 02:16.580]  My back got relaxed.
[02:16.580 --> 02:18.520]  My shoulders went, hey, that's kind of cool.
[02:18.520 --> 02:21.000]  It was like smoking a back rub is kind of what it was like,
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.780]  but it didn't do shit for me mentally.
[02:22.780 --> 02:24.460]  So I will do an intro here,
[02:24.460 --> 02:26.380]  and then we'll take a pause and probably dab
[02:26.380 --> 02:27.860]  some of the Copper Chem Nectar
[02:27.900 --> 02:30.540]  because that has definitely been hitting the spot lately,
[02:30.540 --> 02:32.140]  or the Infinity OG Nectar.
[02:32.140 --> 02:33.680]  I really liked that one too.
[02:33.680 --> 02:35.620]  Anyway, let's move forward with the podcast.
[02:35.620 --> 02:37.580]  I'm dabbing the Cherry Chem Nectar for now.
[02:37.580 --> 02:38.940]  We're gonna take a break in a minute
[02:38.940 --> 02:42.220]  and go in on something with a little bit more of a head high,
[02:42.220 --> 02:46.780]  but until then, let's get a nice podcast intro laid down.
[02:46.780 --> 02:48.000]  All right, where do you guys wanna start?
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.820]  Let's start with this one.
[02:49.820 --> 02:52.860]  On Friday, Bert Kreischer released a new comedy special
[02:52.860 --> 02:54.140]  called Secret Time.
[02:54.140 --> 02:57.440]  He released it on Netflix, and it is hilarious, you guys.
[02:58.020 --> 03:00.120]  I highly recommend the new Bert Kreischer special.
[03:00.120 --> 03:02.080]  If you're not aware, I am a huge comedy nerd.
[03:02.080 --> 03:02.960]  I love comedy.
[03:02.960 --> 03:04.680]  I love going to see live comedy.
[03:04.680 --> 03:06.400]  I love watching comedy shows.
[03:06.400 --> 03:08.680]  I really think comedy is great.
[03:08.680 --> 03:10.380]  Comedy is medicine, in my opinion.
[03:10.380 --> 03:11.560]  It's really good for you to go laugh
[03:11.560 --> 03:13.480]  and get away from some shit for a good hour and a half
[03:13.480 --> 03:14.880]  and just laugh your ass off,
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.420]  have a connection with a bunch of other people.
[03:16.420 --> 03:17.920]  You all get in that tight room.
[03:17.920 --> 03:19.040]  You get told the same jokes.
[03:19.040 --> 03:19.880]  You all laugh.
[03:19.880 --> 03:21.360]  You all feel that same releasing vibe,
[03:21.360 --> 03:23.360]  and then you go back into the world a little refreshed.
[03:23.360 --> 03:25.460]  I think comedy is really good for you.
[03:25.460 --> 03:26.940]  I'm kind of picky on the comedians.
[03:27.740 --> 03:29.980]  I will definitely go see Bert Kreischer
[03:29.980 --> 03:31.700]  every opportunity I get.
[03:31.700 --> 03:34.220]  Bert's new special is hilarious, you guys.
[03:34.220 --> 03:35.940]  A few months back, I talked about going to see
[03:35.940 --> 03:37.620]  Bert at Comedy Works.
[03:37.620 --> 03:39.220]  Big shout out to all of my friends at Comedy Works
[03:39.220 --> 03:41.160]  for taking such great care of me all the time.
[03:41.160 --> 03:42.620]  But when I saw Bert at Comedy Works,
[03:42.620 --> 03:44.820]  I noticed he had cameras and such set up,
[03:44.820 --> 03:46.180]  and he was recording,
[03:46.180 --> 03:48.500]  and he was talking about doing a Netflix special,
[03:48.500 --> 03:52.540]  and he did most of the material that's on his new special.
[03:52.540 --> 03:54.540]  I got to see him do most of that material
[03:54.540 --> 03:57.540]  live at Comedy Works several months ago.
[03:57.540 --> 03:59.240]  For some reason, he chose not to use
[03:59.240 --> 04:02.060]  the Comedy Works footage, and he taped in another place.
[04:02.060 --> 04:02.900]  But Bert's kind of weird.
[04:02.900 --> 04:05.020]  He does test runs and all kinds of strange shit.
[04:05.020 --> 04:05.900]  Bert's a weird character.
[04:05.900 --> 04:07.540]  But if you're into comedy,
[04:07.540 --> 04:08.780]  if you want to laugh your ass off,
[04:08.780 --> 04:10.780]  if you want to see what I laugh my ass off,
[04:10.780 --> 04:12.220]  go check out the new comedy special
[04:12.220 --> 04:14.460]  from Bert Kreischer on Netflix.
[04:14.460 --> 04:16.180]  It is called Secret Time.
[04:16.180 --> 04:17.340]  They don't pay me to say this.
[04:17.340 --> 04:18.460]  I just think it's hilarious,
[04:18.460 --> 04:20.260]  and I think you'll enjoy it too.
[04:20.260 --> 04:21.820]  All right, what else do we need to talk about?
[04:21.820 --> 04:22.660]  Fish is coming.
[04:22.660 --> 04:24.900]  This episode will come out Thursday,
[04:24.900 --> 04:26.340]  Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[04:26.340 --> 04:31.100]  Fish, my favorite band, will be in Denver for three days.
[04:31.100 --> 04:32.080]  They're playing at Dix,
[04:32.080 --> 04:34.300]  the giant soccer field in Commerce City.
[04:34.300 --> 04:36.180]  I will be there for all three shows.
[04:36.180 --> 04:39.660]  If you're going to any of the shows at Dix and you see me,
[04:39.660 --> 04:41.940]  please say hi.
[04:41.940 --> 04:44.540]  It's so frustrating when I get home from Dix,
[04:44.540 --> 04:46.580]  and Monday or Tuesday I'm scrolling through Instagram,
[04:46.580 --> 04:47.420]  and I see somebody say,
[04:47.420 --> 04:48.980]  hey bro, saw you at Dix.
[04:48.980 --> 04:50.740]  Didn't want to bother you, so I didn't say hi.
[04:50.740 --> 04:52.380]  Bro, it's a Fish concert.
[04:53.100 --> 04:53.940]  Say fucking hi.
[04:53.940 --> 04:54.780]  If we're outside in the parking lot,
[04:54.780 --> 04:55.860]  if we're walking through the crowd,
[04:55.860 --> 04:57.520]  if we're somewhere in there, say what's up.
[04:57.520 --> 04:59.420]  You could say hi during the show.
[04:59.420 --> 05:01.140]  I'm gonna probably be wearing a shirt that says
[05:01.140 --> 05:02.860]  don't talk to me while Fish is playing,
[05:02.860 --> 05:05.140]  but if you just want to high five me and introduce yourself,
[05:05.140 --> 05:05.980]  I'm down, bro.
[05:05.980 --> 05:08.460]  Just don't bug me during Harry Hood or Punch You in the Eye,
[05:08.460 --> 05:09.660]  and we should be all right.
[05:09.660 --> 05:10.820]  Now, Punch You in the Eye is a song
[05:10.820 --> 05:13.200]  that's not a result of bugging me during Harry in the Hood.
[05:13.200 --> 05:14.540]  Punch You in the Eye is a song.
[05:14.540 --> 05:15.620]  Let me clear that up.
[05:15.620 --> 05:18.040]  Don't talk to me during Punch You in the Eye at all.
[05:18.040 --> 05:19.340]  Anyway, Fish is coming.
[05:19.340 --> 05:21.340]  If you're there, stop and say hi.
[05:21.340 --> 05:22.300]  A lot of people always tell me,
[05:22.300 --> 05:24.300]  I saw you at this event or at this place,
[05:24.300 --> 05:25.220]  and I didn't want to bug you.
[05:25.220 --> 05:26.060]  Bro, you're not bugging me.
[05:26.060 --> 05:27.740]  I go to those events to talk to people.
[05:27.740 --> 05:29.940]  If I didn't want to see people, I wouldn't show up.
[05:29.940 --> 05:31.140]  I'd stay home and I'd hide out.
[05:31.140 --> 05:32.300]  So come say hi.
[05:32.300 --> 05:33.660]  Give me a high five.
[05:33.660 --> 05:34.860]  Don't be shy.
[05:34.860 --> 05:36.340]  I met a lot of cool people last year,
[05:36.340 --> 05:38.420]  so I look forward to seeing some of those people again
[05:38.420 --> 05:40.220]  and meeting new people.
[05:40.220 --> 05:42.700]  Big old shout out to Amber and her husband.
[05:42.700 --> 05:45.860]  I met Amber in the line getting a lemonade last year,
[05:45.860 --> 05:47.580]  and I actually talked about it on the show.
[05:47.580 --> 05:49.340]  So don't be shy, you guys.
[05:49.340 --> 05:50.260]  Say hi.
[05:50.260 --> 05:51.780]  And if you see me talking to somebody else,
[05:51.780 --> 05:54.500]  don't be shy to jump in because you may be rescuing me.
[05:54.500 --> 05:57.620]  A lot of people like to chew off the ear.
[05:57.620 --> 05:58.660]  So don't be shy.
[05:58.660 --> 05:59.500]  Come say what's up.
[05:59.500 --> 06:02.420]  You may be my knight in shining armor at that moment.
[06:02.420 --> 06:03.780]  All right, you guys, I think that's enough
[06:03.780 --> 06:05.380]  chitter chatter for the podcast.
[06:05.380 --> 06:06.760]  You guys aren't here to hear about my life.
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.100]  You guys are here to learn about cannabis news,
[06:09.100 --> 06:10.820]  education, and conversation.
[06:10.820 --> 06:12.420]  You guys are like, what's with the journal?
[06:12.420 --> 06:15.180]  What's with the fucking diary entry?
[06:15.180 --> 06:18.180]  Let's get on with the podcast about growing cannabis.
[06:18.180 --> 06:19.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, this episode
[06:19.380 --> 06:22.780]  is gonna be about the importance of pH
[06:22.780 --> 06:26.700]  and adjusting your pH correctly in your feed solution.
[06:26.700 --> 06:29.020]  So let's talk about pH.
[06:29.020 --> 06:31.100]  But before I do that, I think I'm gonna press pause.
[06:31.100 --> 06:33.060]  I'm gonna listen back to the part I have recorded.
[06:33.060 --> 06:34.300]  I'm gonna take a couple of dabs,
[06:34.300 --> 06:36.380]  and once I'm satisfied with this intro,
[06:36.380 --> 06:39.500]  I will come back and I will talk about the importance
[06:39.500 --> 06:43.340]  of properly adjusting the pH of your nutrient solution.
[06:43.340 --> 06:50.450]  All right, you guys, I am back.
[06:51.170 --> 06:52.530]  I got dabbed out.
[06:52.530 --> 06:54.850]  I took some dabs of the copper chem nectar.
[06:54.850 --> 06:57.350]  I feel like I'm in slow motion.
[06:57.350 --> 07:00.410]  I feel like I need a Dr. Pepper and possibly a helmet.
[07:00.410 --> 07:02.130]  I think we're gonna be okay.
[07:02.130 --> 07:05.890]  Let's do a podcast about the importance of pH.
[07:05.890 --> 07:08.570]  A good spot to start is what does pH mean?
[07:08.570 --> 07:10.650]  pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[07:10.650 --> 07:12.010]  That's why when you see pH written,
[07:12.010 --> 07:15.290]  it is a lowercase p and an uppercase H.
[07:15.290 --> 07:17.690]  H stands for hydrogen.
[07:17.690 --> 07:19.330]  That's what pH stands for.
[07:19.330 --> 07:21.650]  There's more to it, but that is basically
[07:21.650 --> 07:23.050]  what we need to know right now.
[07:23.050 --> 07:25.650]  pH stands for potential hydrogen.
[07:25.650 --> 07:27.410]  What is pH?
[07:27.410 --> 07:30.970]  pH is the scale used to measure the acidity
[07:30.970 --> 07:33.050]  and alkalinity of a solution,
[07:33.050 --> 07:36.210]  the acid and base of a solution.
[07:36.210 --> 07:39.770]  pH ranges from one to 14.
[07:39.770 --> 07:41.490]  Seven is neutral.
[07:41.490 --> 07:45.650]  A pH value below seven is acidic.
[07:45.690 --> 07:50.690]  A pH value above seven is considered alkaline or base.
[07:51.090 --> 07:52.570]  And now I've done some research
[07:52.570 --> 07:55.330]  and we can go into the negative ranges
[07:55.330 --> 07:59.330]  and we can go above 14 in extreme cases,
[07:59.330 --> 08:02.170]  but that is very rare so far.
[08:02.170 --> 08:04.610]  Let's talk about some things and their pH.
[08:04.610 --> 08:06.170]  Let's start with Dr. Pepper.
[08:06.170 --> 08:08.250]  I've got a bottle of Dr. Pepper in front of me.
[08:08.250 --> 08:11.750]  Dr. Pepper pH is three.
[08:11.750 --> 08:14.730]  The pH of dairy milk, like if you had some cow milk,
[08:14.730 --> 08:16.210]  the milk in most people's refrigerator,
[08:16.210 --> 08:17.570]  I don't drink dairy milk myself,
[08:17.570 --> 08:19.050]  but the milk that a lot of people
[08:19.050 --> 08:20.370]  have in their refrigerator,
[08:20.370 --> 08:25.370]  milk, the pH value of milk is about 6.5 to 6.7.
[08:26.290 --> 08:28.930]  Bleach, everybody knows bleach, right?
[08:28.930 --> 08:32.010]  The pH of bleach is 12.
[08:32.010 --> 08:34.090]  Those are just a few examples.
[08:34.090 --> 08:36.450]  The pH value of a few solutions
[08:36.450 --> 08:38.210]  that we are all familiar with.
[08:38.210 --> 08:39.890]  Most things within the human body
[08:39.890 --> 08:42.510]  hover around a pH of seven,
[08:42.510 --> 08:44.730]  from most of what I have read.
[08:44.730 --> 08:46.770]  Randomly, one of the charts I was looking at
[08:46.770 --> 08:50.310]  listed the pH of urine, and if you're curious,
[08:50.310 --> 08:51.470]  the pH, I don't know how they know
[08:51.470 --> 08:53.670]  the pH of my urine and your urine.
[08:53.670 --> 08:54.950]  Are we that common?
[08:54.950 --> 08:58.550]  But anyway, piss is listed at a pH of six.
[08:58.550 --> 09:00.870]  I don't know why, but they've got it listed here.
[09:00.870 --> 09:03.070]  So, now that we've got a few examples
[09:03.070 --> 09:05.910]  of the pH of solutions in which we are familiar,
[09:05.910 --> 09:09.670]  let's talk about the pH in our nutrient solution
[09:09.670 --> 09:12.510]  when we're feeding our cannabis plants.
[09:12.510 --> 09:14.230]  The pH of our feed solution
[09:14.230 --> 09:17.870]  determines which nutrients are available to our plant.
[09:17.870 --> 09:20.270]  We may have mixed the perfect nutrient solution
[09:20.270 --> 09:22.230]  to make the plants explode with growth,
[09:22.230 --> 09:24.110]  but if the pH is off,
[09:24.110 --> 09:27.390]  the plant won't uptake the nutrients we offered.
[09:27.390 --> 09:30.370]  Poor pH will cause slow growth,
[09:30.370 --> 09:33.510]  yellow leaves, and diminished yields.
[09:33.510 --> 09:37.190]  Improper pH will also lead to other problems like lockouts,
[09:37.190 --> 09:39.910]  and poor pH is often confused
[09:39.910 --> 09:41.870]  with other nutrient deficiencies,
[09:41.870 --> 09:44.890]  and it will make a grower react to a deficiency,
[09:44.890 --> 09:47.150]  causing even more problems.
[09:47.150 --> 09:48.990]  Let's say you think you've got nitrogen deficiency
[09:48.990 --> 09:50.610]  because the pH is too high,
[09:50.610 --> 09:53.090]  the plants aren't eating, so you increase the nitrogen,
[09:53.090 --> 09:54.870]  and then you're really just burning the plants,
[09:54.870 --> 09:56.270]  you're causing more of a lockout,
[09:56.270 --> 09:57.910]  you're causing more problems.
[09:57.910 --> 10:00.870]  Low pH looks like burned or wilting leaves.
[10:00.870 --> 10:03.910]  High pH will make your plants yellow,
[10:03.910 --> 10:06.790]  and slow, and skinny, and shitty.
[10:07.310 --> 10:10.030]  Proper pH is important because each mineral
[10:10.030 --> 10:13.450]  is absorbed by the plant at specific pH ranges.
[10:14.450 --> 10:16.710]  We're feeding the plants 16 minerals.
[10:16.710 --> 10:18.110]  These plants want 16 minerals.
[10:18.110 --> 10:21.010]  We're adding other stuff to that 16 also.
[10:21.010 --> 10:22.750]  We're putting mycos in there,
[10:22.750 --> 10:24.390]  and we get crazy and add our own stuff,
[10:24.390 --> 10:26.710]  but they basically want these 16 minerals.
[10:26.710 --> 10:29.270]  We want these 16 minerals for our plant.
[10:29.270 --> 10:32.310]  We've learned that most of those 16 minerals
[10:32.310 --> 10:34.430]  are best available in a solution
[10:34.430 --> 10:37.950]  with a pH around 6 to 6.5,
[10:37.950 --> 10:40.950]  depending on your specific cultivar,
[10:40.950 --> 10:42.430]  your specific medium,
[10:42.430 --> 10:45.430]  and of course your specific environment.
[10:45.430 --> 10:48.530]  Your lighting, your temperature, your humidity,
[10:48.530 --> 10:49.870]  your vapor pressure deficit
[10:49.870 --> 10:51.970]  are all going to make a difference,
[10:51.970 --> 10:53.790]  but mainly it will be your medium
[10:53.790 --> 10:56.190]  and that specific cultivar.
[10:56.190 --> 10:57.830]  And I do say specific cultivar.
[10:58.710 --> 11:00.110]  All right, podcast world, I don't know why,
[11:00.110 --> 11:02.070]  but for some reason right here in the recording,
[11:02.070 --> 11:03.750]  the software made a hideous noise,
[11:03.750 --> 11:04.590]  so I cut it out.
[11:04.590 --> 11:06.390]  You missed four seconds.
[11:06.390 --> 11:08.270]  You're going to have to dial it in.
[11:08.270 --> 11:09.850]  In a commercial setting,
[11:09.850 --> 11:12.550]  we decide on a pH that works for most of our plants,
[11:12.550 --> 11:14.490]  and we run that pH for the crop,
[11:14.490 --> 11:16.550]  and we take notes, and we make sure it's working,
[11:16.550 --> 11:18.350]  and we adjust if we need to.
[11:18.350 --> 11:20.830]  If the majority of the plants are satisfied,
[11:20.830 --> 11:23.550]  we leave it at the pH we've decided.
[11:23.550 --> 11:25.270]  In a commercial facility in cocoa,
[11:25.270 --> 11:29.670]  I like to run about 6.3 on the pH when I'm in flower.
[11:29.670 --> 11:31.870]  If we see issues, we adjust a little higher
[11:31.870 --> 11:32.710]  or a little lower.
[11:32.710 --> 11:35.710]  I usually stick between 6 and 6.5.
[11:35.710 --> 11:38.670]  I rarely go to 6.5, maybe 6.4.
[11:38.670 --> 11:41.270]  Usually 6.2 to 6.4 is where I want to stay
[11:41.270 --> 11:43.230]  on my pH in a commercial grow.
[11:43.230 --> 11:47.670]  So let's talk about nutrient availability on a pH scale.
[11:47.670 --> 11:49.610]  I've got a chart in front of me,
[11:49.610 --> 11:52.070]  and this chart lists nitrogen, phosphorus,
[11:52.070 --> 11:53.510]  potassium, sulfur.
[11:53.510 --> 11:56.110]  It goes on and lists a lot of different nutrients here,
[11:56.110 --> 11:57.510]  a lot of different elements.
[11:57.510 --> 11:59.110]  And then it shows the pH range
[11:59.110 --> 12:01.830]  at which each element is available.
[12:01.830 --> 12:05.110]  And it shows each element taper off from end to end
[12:05.110 --> 12:07.710]  as it becomes less available at a different pH range.
[12:07.710 --> 12:10.430]  It shows that nitrogen is barely available
[12:10.430 --> 12:13.550]  in the four, 4.5, five, 5.5 range.
[12:13.550 --> 12:16.510]  Once we get to six, six, five, and seven,
[12:16.510 --> 12:19.610]  the little graph of availability gets huge.
[12:19.610 --> 12:21.550]  So nitrogen, and then it tapers off again
[12:21.550 --> 12:23.510]  once we get to the eight, 8.5,
[12:23.510 --> 12:25.150]  and then by nine, nine, five, and 10,
[12:25.150 --> 12:26.590]  it's totally unavailable.
[12:26.590 --> 12:29.950]  So I can see that the ideal range for nitrogen
[12:29.950 --> 12:32.310]  would be somewhere between six and eight.
[12:32.310 --> 12:34.030]  It looks like nitrogen is plenty available
[12:34.030 --> 12:35.030]  right there in that area.
[12:35.030 --> 12:37.510]  But then right underneath there is phosphorus.
[12:37.510 --> 12:41.390]  And the chart for phosphorus is much less available.
[12:41.390 --> 12:45.950]  Down here at the four, 4.5, all the way to about 5.7,
[12:47.870 --> 12:50.310]  there's no phosphorus availability to the plants.
[12:50.310 --> 12:51.230]  Once you hit six,
[12:51.230 --> 12:53.590]  the little balloon of phosphorus availability
[12:53.590 --> 12:54.790]  swells up and it gets huge.
[12:54.790 --> 12:56.430]  It looks like you've created a dart.
[12:56.430 --> 12:58.390]  The other one looks like a missile, the way it tapers.
[12:58.390 --> 12:59.550]  This one looks like a dart.
[13:00.110 --> 13:02.310]  It goes real skinny, skinny, skinny, totally available.
[13:02.310 --> 13:04.270]  So right as we hit the six area,
[13:04.270 --> 13:06.070]  we've got a lot of phosphorus available.
[13:06.070 --> 13:10.670]  The pH of six gives us a lot of availability of phosphorus.
[13:10.670 --> 13:12.270]  Then it starts tapering off.
[13:12.270 --> 13:14.310]  Right at 7.5, it tapers off a little.
[13:14.310 --> 13:15.390]  By eight, we're almost done.
[13:15.390 --> 13:17.910]  At 8.5, phosphorus has cut itself off.
[13:17.910 --> 13:20.790]  But oddly enough, around 8.7,
[13:20.790 --> 13:22.670]  phosphorus really becomes available.
[13:22.670 --> 13:26.470]  All the way from 8.7 to 10, it is just fully available.
[13:26.470 --> 13:28.890]  But I can see there's a commonality here.
[13:28.930 --> 13:31.810]  This area where phosphorus is real wide in the middle
[13:31.810 --> 13:36.250]  and nitrogen is real wide is right about 6.2 to 7.5.
[13:36.250 --> 13:38.810]  So why wouldn't I start thinking about getting my pH
[13:38.810 --> 13:43.050]  dialed into 6.2 to 7.5 on this scale so far, it looks like.
[13:43.050 --> 13:44.970]  Then as we move down, potassium.
[13:44.970 --> 13:46.450]  Potassium is widely available.
[13:46.450 --> 13:50.170]  Once we get above 5.5, potassium comes in.
[13:50.170 --> 13:51.630]  Sulfur, kind of similar.
[13:51.630 --> 13:53.930]  Calcium, now this is why we're trying to narrow down
[13:53.930 --> 13:55.490]  our pH a little bit tighter.
[13:55.490 --> 13:57.810]  Calcium is not available at all
[13:57.810 --> 13:59.810]  until we get to about six.
[13:59.810 --> 14:02.490]  And then once you've passed, let's see,
[14:02.490 --> 14:03.730]  once you've passed seven,
[14:03.730 --> 14:06.330]  the calcium starts tapering off very heavily.
[14:06.330 --> 14:09.210]  So right between six and seven, that calcium comes in.
[14:09.210 --> 14:12.310]  So now, we pretty much, by looking at this chart,
[14:12.310 --> 14:16.450]  I see that I don't even want to do anything lower than six.
[14:16.450 --> 14:18.650]  Nothing is even available other than potassium
[14:18.650 --> 14:19.910]  and nitrogen at six.
[14:19.910 --> 14:21.170]  So I'm not gonna get any sulfur.
[14:21.170 --> 14:22.370]  I'm not gonna get any calcium.
[14:22.370 --> 14:24.930]  And I'm not gonna get any magnesium from what I'm seeing.
[14:24.930 --> 14:27.810]  Magnesium and calcium are on a very similar curve.
[14:27.810 --> 14:29.130]  The next one is iron.
[14:30.290 --> 14:32.770]  Iron is the opposite of potassium.
[14:32.770 --> 14:37.570]  Iron is hyperavailable at low levels of pH.
[14:37.570 --> 14:40.370]  When you're down here in the four, five, 5.5,
[14:40.370 --> 14:43.330]  all the way to six, iron is heavily available.
[14:43.330 --> 14:45.610]  But it starts tapering at six.
[14:45.610 --> 14:47.030]  And by the time we get to seven,
[14:47.030 --> 14:50.290]  there's a very low availability of iron.
[14:50.290 --> 14:53.410]  So now, why I can't go up to seven on my pH,
[14:53.410 --> 14:55.530]  is that's gonna push me out of having iron.
[14:55.530 --> 14:58.690]  So now, I've gotta narrow it down to about 6.5.
[14:58.690 --> 15:01.330]  It's looking like if I wanna get this bubble of nitrogen
[15:01.330 --> 15:04.070]  at its peak, it's bubble of phosphorus at its peak,
[15:04.070 --> 15:07.130]  these charts really make sense once you see it this way.
[15:07.130 --> 15:09.890]  The manganese and boron are very similar
[15:09.890 --> 15:12.130]  in the shape, and zinc, they're very similar
[15:12.130 --> 15:14.430]  in their shape of pH availability.
[15:14.430 --> 15:16.010]  They start off at 4.5.
[15:16.010 --> 15:17.130]  They're not very available.
[15:17.130 --> 15:20.150]  By the time we get to five, they're quite available.
[15:20.150 --> 15:22.570]  That lasts all the way through about the 6.5.
[15:22.610 --> 15:24.170]  Then they start tapering off.
[15:24.170 --> 15:26.170]  So that, again, is another opportunity for us
[15:26.170 --> 15:28.770]  to dial it into 6.5 or lower,
[15:28.770 --> 15:31.450]  or we're gonna start losing the availability
[15:31.450 --> 15:34.450]  of manganese, boron, copper, and zinc.
[15:34.450 --> 15:37.370]  Molybdenum, molybdenum basically mirrors potassium.
[15:37.370 --> 15:38.790]  It's a little thinner at the beginning here.
[15:38.790 --> 15:43.490]  It doesn't become available until about six, 6.2.
[15:43.490 --> 15:45.930]  So that's why we're gonna have to go a little bit
[15:45.930 --> 15:49.130]  to about the 6.2, just to get that molybdenum in there.
[15:49.970 --> 15:51.950]  All right, I think I've got the point across.
[15:52.350 --> 15:54.910]  It is a chart that shows where the nutrient's available.
[15:54.910 --> 15:57.870]  There's a stripe that goes down and shows the pH range,
[15:57.870 --> 16:00.070]  and it makes it really obvious when you see this chart.
[16:00.070 --> 16:02.390]  If you Google for one of these pH scale
[16:02.390 --> 16:06.310]  in cannabis charts, it will be really easy to understand.
[16:06.310 --> 16:09.790]  So that chart makes it easy to see why we would adjust
[16:09.790 --> 16:14.790]  the pH of our feed solution to a range of 6.2 to 6.5,
[16:15.790 --> 16:17.470]  or 6.0 to 6.5.
[16:17.470 --> 16:20.110]  I like to start at 6.3 and adjust as needed
[16:20.110 --> 16:21.470]  because I can see what's going on.
[16:21.970 --> 16:23.390]  I can tell when they need to go higher,
[16:23.390 --> 16:24.390]  when they need to go lower.
[16:24.390 --> 16:25.710]  I can tell if there's a lockout.
[16:25.710 --> 16:26.950]  I'm more experienced.
[16:26.950 --> 16:28.790]  Write it down, take a lot of notes,
[16:28.790 --> 16:31.110]  and pay attention to what you're doing in your garden,
[16:31.110 --> 16:33.110]  and you will be able to diagnose the problems
[16:33.110 --> 16:33.950]  as they come along.
[16:33.950 --> 16:36.270]  You'll be able to adjust your pH as needed.
[16:36.270 --> 16:37.670]  You'll be able to tell the difference
[16:37.670 --> 16:40.470]  between a pH problem and a CalMag deficiency
[16:40.470 --> 16:44.070]  if you were writing down the pH of your solution every day.
[16:44.070 --> 16:45.110]  If you're not adjusting it,
[16:45.110 --> 16:46.790]  if you're not paying any attention to it,
[16:46.790 --> 16:50.430]  you may have a CalMag solution, you may have a pH issue,
[16:50.430 --> 16:52.230]  you may have a nutrient lockout issue.
[16:52.230 --> 16:53.310]  You won't know.
[16:53.310 --> 16:54.630]  It could be anything at this point.
[16:54.630 --> 16:57.030]  So we can at least diagnose problems
[16:57.030 --> 17:00.430]  by knowing what the pH is going in.
[17:00.430 --> 17:02.730]  And we'll talk about checking the pH coming out
[17:02.730 --> 17:04.590]  in a later episode.
[17:04.590 --> 17:08.150]  So small plants will need lower pH.
[17:08.150 --> 17:12.390]  Cuttings, rooting clones, they could go as low as 5.8.
[17:12.390 --> 17:15.190]  And veg and early flower move up just a little bit
[17:15.190 --> 17:16.310]  to about 6.0.
[17:16.310 --> 17:19.750]  By full flower, I'm at 6.3, maybe 6.4,
[17:19.750 --> 17:21.630]  depending on the needs of that crop.
[17:21.630 --> 17:26.110]  If you see micronutrient deficiencies during flower,
[17:26.110 --> 17:29.510]  try lowering the pH of your nutrient solution,
[17:29.510 --> 17:34.270]  and that will make your micronutrients more bioavailable.
[17:34.270 --> 17:36.870]  So let's talk about mixing up your nutrients
[17:36.870 --> 17:40.070]  and adjusting the pH of your solution.
[17:40.070 --> 17:42.270]  This applies for any size container.
[17:42.270 --> 17:43.470]  If you're mixing up a gallon,
[17:43.470 --> 17:46.910]  if you're mixing up 1,000 gallons, this will be similar.
[17:46.910 --> 17:48.190]  If you've got something big enough
[17:48.190 --> 17:49.350]  that it needs a lot of stirring,
[17:49.350 --> 17:50.470]  that you can't stir it by hand,
[17:50.470 --> 17:52.590]  anything more than five or 10 gallons,
[17:52.590 --> 17:53.590]  I would put a pump in there.
[17:53.590 --> 17:55.470]  If you've got one of the Brute trash cans,
[17:55.470 --> 17:57.490]  I always drop a small pump in the bottom of there,
[17:57.490 --> 17:59.070]  keep that water moving.
[17:59.070 --> 18:00.710]  Use your water source.
[18:00.710 --> 18:01.830]  Whatever water you're using,
[18:01.830 --> 18:03.270]  I'm not gonna be specific about that.
[18:03.270 --> 18:06.790]  If you're using tap water, if you're using RO water,
[18:06.790 --> 18:09.850]  if you're using whatever water you've got, do that thing.
[18:09.850 --> 18:11.950]  As long as you've had it tested and it's working for you,
[18:11.950 --> 18:14.350]  use your water, get your water source.
[18:14.350 --> 18:15.470]  Now add your nutrients.
[18:15.470 --> 18:17.990]  I've done an episode a while back on the order
[18:18.830 --> 18:20.590]  in which I recommend you mix your nutrients.
[18:20.590 --> 18:22.510]  Listen to that if you haven't.
[18:22.510 --> 18:23.470]  Mix your nutrients.
[18:23.470 --> 18:24.350]  Mix it really well.
[18:24.350 --> 18:25.270]  You've got that pump in there.
[18:25.270 --> 18:26.310]  If you've got a big container,
[18:26.310 --> 18:27.510]  if you're using a five gallon bucket,
[18:27.510 --> 18:28.510]  you got a stick or something,
[18:28.510 --> 18:29.510]  you're stirring it up real well,
[18:29.510 --> 18:33.190]  maybe a piece of PVC plumbing or a piece of PVC pipe.
[18:33.190 --> 18:34.750]  So you mix it up really well.
[18:34.750 --> 18:36.270]  You've got all your nutrients in there.
[18:36.270 --> 18:37.590]  You're almost ready to water, right?
[18:37.590 --> 18:41.350]  Then just simply stick a pH pen or a pH meter in there
[18:41.350 --> 18:43.790]  and check the pH of that solution
[18:43.790 --> 18:46.430]  before you water it into your plants.
[18:46.430 --> 18:49.230]  If it's too low, add a few drops of pH up.
[18:49.230 --> 18:51.830]  If it's too high, add a few drops of pH down
[18:51.830 --> 18:53.610]  and keep measuring until you get it dialed in
[18:53.610 --> 18:54.770]  where you want.
[18:54.770 --> 18:57.710]  Go slowly when adding drops, you guys.
[18:57.710 --> 19:00.210]  It will change quickly.
[19:00.210 --> 19:01.390]  You'll put in, if it's,
[19:01.390 --> 19:03.990]  let's say that you're at fucking 7.2, right,
[19:03.990 --> 19:05.830]  and you're trying to get to 6.3.
[19:05.830 --> 19:07.790]  You'll put in a couple drops, nothing will happen.
[19:07.790 --> 19:09.950]  You'll put in a couple drops, it'll go to 7.1.
[19:09.950 --> 19:13.270]  You'll put in a couple more and it goes to 6.9.
[19:13.270 --> 19:14.510]  You're like, oh shit.
[19:14.510 --> 19:15.670]  So you let it chill for a minute.
[19:15.670 --> 19:18.270]  You put in two more drops, you're gonna be at 6.4.
[19:18.270 --> 19:21.110]  We'll talk about why later in the episode.
[19:21.110 --> 19:22.470]  Be careful when you're adding drops.
[19:22.470 --> 19:24.630]  It's going to change quickly.
[19:24.630 --> 19:28.570]  Also, do not get the pH up or down solution
[19:28.570 --> 19:30.350]  on your skin or in your eyes.
[19:30.350 --> 19:31.590]  That stuff is terrible.
[19:31.590 --> 19:33.750]  Wear gloves if you're clumsy.
[19:33.750 --> 19:35.870]  Always wear gloves when you're mixing nutrients,
[19:35.870 --> 19:38.690]  especially when handling the pH up and down.
[19:38.690 --> 19:40.630]  Wear goggles if you're clumsy.
[19:40.630 --> 19:42.390]  I recommend doing it all the time anyway,
[19:42.390 --> 19:43.950]  but some of you are stubborn.
[19:44.110 --> 19:45.670]  Just keep in mind the pH up and down
[19:45.670 --> 19:48.190]  can burn the living shit out of your eyes.
[19:48.190 --> 19:49.830]  The temperature of your water will affect
[19:49.830 --> 19:52.350]  the pH of your solution as well.
[19:52.350 --> 19:55.090]  Don't try to adjust the pH of really cold water.
[19:55.090 --> 19:57.190]  It will frustrate the shit out of you,
[19:57.190 --> 19:59.190]  and then when it warms up, the solution will be
[19:59.190 --> 20:01.670]  way off in pH and you'll have to go back at it
[20:01.670 --> 20:02.590]  all over again.
[20:02.590 --> 20:05.630]  Let the water get to 69 to 75 degrees
[20:05.630 --> 20:07.510]  before you try to adjust it.
[20:07.510 --> 20:09.790]  Closer to 72, 75 will be better for you.
[20:09.790 --> 20:10.790]  69 would work.
[20:10.790 --> 20:12.490]  That's the lowest I would go.
[20:12.570 --> 20:15.010]  Don't feed cold water to your plants.
[20:15.010 --> 20:17.510]  I describe it as stick your fucking feet in there.
[20:17.510 --> 20:18.970]  Do you want to put your feet in that water?
[20:18.970 --> 20:20.450]  No, your plants probably don't want
[20:20.450 --> 20:21.870]  their roots in it either.
[20:21.870 --> 20:23.090]  Put your balls in there, see what you think.
[20:23.090 --> 20:24.210]  You're gonna go, oh God, and you're gonna
[20:24.210 --> 20:25.030]  pull them out real quick.
[20:25.030 --> 20:26.250]  That's what the plants do when you feed them
[20:26.250 --> 20:27.330]  with water that cold.
[20:27.330 --> 20:29.250]  Don't do that shit to your plants, you guys.
[20:29.250 --> 20:32.050]  Write down the pH of your solution
[20:32.050 --> 20:33.690]  that you're feeding into your plants.
[20:33.690 --> 20:34.610]  Write it down.
[20:34.610 --> 20:35.450]  You're checking it.
[20:35.450 --> 20:36.650]  Just grab a pen and write it down.
[20:36.650 --> 20:38.710]  Most of you probably have a dry erase board
[20:38.710 --> 20:40.250]  or a clipboard or some sort of notebook
[20:40.250 --> 20:41.610]  or a note in your phone.
[20:41.610 --> 20:44.050]  Something, please, just write down the pH.
[20:44.050 --> 20:45.250]  That's gonna help us in the future
[20:45.250 --> 20:47.350]  should we notice problems.
[20:47.350 --> 20:50.190]  Also, if you've got the equipment,
[20:50.190 --> 20:54.250]  write down the EC or the PPMs of that feed solution
[20:54.250 --> 20:55.850]  if you've got that meter.
[20:55.850 --> 20:57.530]  If you're gonna go buy a meter,
[20:57.530 --> 20:59.770]  I would consider getting the EC or the PPM meter
[20:59.770 --> 21:01.610]  while you're at it if you're really gonna devote
[21:01.610 --> 21:04.250]  your time and energy to growing high quality cannabis.
[21:04.250 --> 21:07.850]  So, now we've got a big bucket of water
[21:07.850 --> 21:09.370]  and it's been pH adjusted.
[21:09.370 --> 21:11.370]  It's got our nutrients in there and it's ready to go
[21:12.130 --> 21:12.970]  and it's at the correct temperature.
[21:12.970 --> 21:14.810]  Now, water your plants thoroughly
[21:14.810 --> 21:16.570]  and let some of the water run out of the pot.
[21:16.570 --> 21:19.290]  Jorge taught us that we want the water to be abundant
[21:19.290 --> 21:20.450]  but not excessive.
[21:20.450 --> 21:22.570]  So, water till some runs out
[21:22.570 --> 21:24.130]  and then let it dry up a little bit
[21:24.130 --> 21:26.410]  and then water them when you feel like it's time for them.
[21:26.410 --> 21:27.250]  They'll show you.
[21:27.250 --> 21:28.090]  Those plants will let you know
[21:28.090 --> 21:29.930]  when it's time to water them again.
[21:29.930 --> 21:31.130]  Water them on your cycle.
[21:31.130 --> 21:32.370]  Don't let me interrupt your cycle.
[21:32.370 --> 21:33.210]  Do what you're doing,
[21:33.210 --> 21:36.410]  but let the water be abundant but not excessive.
[21:36.410 --> 21:37.710]  So, water those plants.
[21:37.710 --> 21:40.050]  Have some come running out of the bottom.
[21:40.050 --> 21:41.930]  Having a little bit of water run out of the bottom
[21:41.930 --> 21:43.250]  has a lot of benefits.
[21:43.250 --> 21:46.070]  We'll talk about more of that in a future episode.
[21:46.070 --> 21:48.590]  If you want to get really detailed,
[21:48.590 --> 21:51.170]  catch some of that water coming out of those plants
[21:51.170 --> 21:56.050]  and document the pH and the EC of that water that comes out.
[21:56.050 --> 21:58.750]  Now we've got what's going in and what's going out.
[21:58.750 --> 22:00.290]  Should we notice problems in the future,
[22:00.290 --> 22:04.310]  we can use that information to help us diagnose our issues.
[22:04.310 --> 22:05.650]  When you've got a large crop
[22:05.650 --> 22:07.530]  and you've got thousands of plants,
[22:07.530 --> 22:09.170]  this really comes in handy.
[22:09.170 --> 22:11.570]  So this is a good practice to start now,
[22:11.570 --> 22:13.490]  especially if you plan on getting
[22:13.490 --> 22:15.690]  into the commercial industry in the future.
[22:15.690 --> 22:17.570]  Get comfortable with these devices
[22:17.570 --> 22:19.290]  and with this type of note-taking.
[22:19.290 --> 22:22.870]  Also, maybe get used to using a Google document
[22:22.870 --> 22:24.470]  because that's how I'm gonna make you do it
[22:24.470 --> 22:25.970]  if you work in one of my facilities.
[22:25.970 --> 22:28.970]  We keep all of the pH charts on a Google Doc
[22:28.970 --> 22:30.730]  so that I can see it wherever I am.
[22:30.730 --> 22:32.010]  The other workers can open it up.
[22:32.010 --> 22:34.890]  They can throw in the information that's needed.
[22:34.890 --> 22:36.990]  We type down the nutrients that were put in,
[22:36.990 --> 22:40.510]  the pH, the EC, the temperature, what time it was done,
[22:40.510 --> 22:42.590]  how many gallons were mixed and who did it.
[22:42.590 --> 22:44.030]  Goes on to every feeding.
[22:44.030 --> 22:46.670]  So document all of that stuff.
[22:46.670 --> 22:48.630]  And then you can identify problems in the future
[22:48.630 --> 22:50.390]  and it makes accountability
[22:50.390 --> 22:52.810]  for when there's more than one person working in the garden.
[22:52.810 --> 22:53.730]  So you don't need a lot.
[22:53.730 --> 22:55.110]  If you're gonna catch some runoff,
[22:55.110 --> 22:57.670]  you can just use a little tiny cup or a small container,
[22:57.670 --> 22:59.410]  something that catches enough water for you
[22:59.410 --> 23:01.470]  to put your pH meter in.
[23:01.470 --> 23:02.910]  You just need enough to cover the probe
[23:02.910 --> 23:05.730]  and see what the pH is, possibly see what the EC is.
[23:05.730 --> 23:06.570]  That's all you need.
[23:07.090 --> 23:07.930]  So just catch a little water,
[23:07.930 --> 23:09.650]  maybe gather two different containers
[23:09.650 --> 23:11.490]  from two different plants at the end of the table.
[23:11.490 --> 23:12.690]  I don't know your setup.
[23:12.690 --> 23:13.730]  You'll figure that one out.
[23:13.730 --> 23:15.170]  I'm sure if you're gonna do this,
[23:15.170 --> 23:18.210]  you're smart enough to figure that part out.
[23:18.210 --> 23:20.130]  So a lot of people are gonna wanna measure
[23:20.130 --> 23:22.850]  the pH of the medium, the soil or the cocoa
[23:22.850 --> 23:23.970]  after they water.
[23:23.970 --> 23:26.730]  Honestly, I don't do that.
[23:26.730 --> 23:28.090]  It's constantly changing.
[23:29.010 --> 23:30.970]  It will change as that medium dries out
[23:30.970 --> 23:32.150]  and changes temperature.
[23:32.150 --> 23:35.090]  It's going to constantly be changing from the minute.
[23:35.090 --> 23:36.470]  So it's a little bit dry.
[23:37.370 --> 23:40.070]  The minute the water hits, changing pH.
[23:40.070 --> 23:41.990]  But when you're done watering,
[23:41.990 --> 23:43.710]  already starting to change pH.
[23:43.710 --> 23:46.370]  By the time you get the probe in there, different pH.
[23:46.370 --> 23:48.590]  So it's always going to be changing in there.
[23:48.590 --> 23:51.150]  You've got a little environment happening in there.
[23:52.470 --> 23:53.670]  It's expected.
[23:53.670 --> 23:54.670]  It's expected to change
[23:54.670 --> 23:56.710]  and it's going to work to your advantage.
[23:56.710 --> 23:59.230]  This slight shift, I wrote down the word swing,
[23:59.230 --> 24:00.230]  but I don't wanna say swing.
[24:00.230 --> 24:02.990]  This slight shift in pH in the rhizosphere
[24:02.990 --> 24:06.310]  will make more nutrients available to the plant
[24:07.150 --> 24:08.070]  and keep stimulating your plants to eat.
[24:08.070 --> 24:10.150]  So earlier we talked about some of the plants
[24:10.150 --> 24:12.430]  are more available on a high pH range.
[24:12.430 --> 24:14.550]  Some are more available on a low pH range.
[24:14.550 --> 24:16.750]  Well, now your plant's gonna naturally dry up a little bit.
[24:16.750 --> 24:18.390]  The pH is gonna change in there
[24:18.390 --> 24:20.510]  and it's gonna go, oh look, there's copper now.
[24:20.510 --> 24:22.390]  And it didn't realize it could get that copper earlier.
[24:22.390 --> 24:24.030]  But since the pH just shifted a little,
[24:24.030 --> 24:25.390]  I'm just guessing on copper.
[24:25.390 --> 24:26.810]  I just picked one and go, oh look,
[24:26.810 --> 24:28.550]  now I can drink this copper that's been sitting here
[24:28.550 --> 24:30.030]  that I didn't know I wanted.
[24:30.030 --> 24:32.850]  Because naturally that pH changed just a little bit.
[24:32.850 --> 24:34.590]  I'm not talking about a 0.5.
[24:34.590 --> 24:36.510]  I'm talking like a 0.2, a 0.1,
[24:36.510 --> 24:39.870]  maybe a 0.3 change in our rhizosphere.
[24:39.870 --> 24:41.390]  That is just fine.
[24:41.390 --> 24:46.390]  Don't stress, don't obsess over the pH of your medium.
[24:47.390 --> 24:48.950]  If you haven't done anything crazy
[24:48.950 --> 24:50.350]  or added anything crazy in there
[24:50.350 --> 24:52.310]  and if you haven't seen any problems,
[24:52.310 --> 24:56.550]  the pH of your soil or your medium is just fine.
[24:56.550 --> 24:58.390]  It will only need to be adjusted
[24:58.390 --> 25:00.470]  if you've done something to it.
[25:00.470 --> 25:03.470]  So now let's talk about pH pens and meters.
[25:03.470 --> 25:05.710]  I'm not sponsored by any equipment company,
[25:05.710 --> 25:08.290]  but I use the Bluelab meters.
[25:08.290 --> 25:09.870]  They all seem to have a short lifespan.
[25:09.870 --> 25:11.950]  You guys, every meter I've bought, every brand,
[25:11.950 --> 25:13.270]  I've bought several brands,
[25:13.270 --> 25:15.110]  I've tried several different companies.
[25:15.110 --> 25:17.630]  They all seem to have a very limited lifespan.
[25:17.630 --> 25:19.950]  Those pen type that they're just little,
[25:19.950 --> 25:21.110]  looks like a little pen, I guess.
[25:21.110 --> 25:23.550]  I don't know how else to, it looks like a large pen.
[25:23.550 --> 25:25.390]  Looks like a pregnancy test.
[25:25.390 --> 25:28.270]  Those all have a very limited lifespan.
[25:28.270 --> 25:29.830]  Sometimes it's grower fault.
[25:29.830 --> 25:32.750]  Sometimes I think it's just, they're not super,
[25:32.750 --> 25:34.470]  I don't think they want them to last a long time.
[25:34.470 --> 25:35.990]  I think they want us to have to buy a new one
[25:35.990 --> 25:36.830]  to tell you the truth.
[25:36.830 --> 25:38.270]  They make money off of us by doing that.
[25:38.270 --> 25:41.070]  But I like the Bluelab meters,
[25:41.070 --> 25:44.870]  but you have to keep any, no matter what pH meter you buy,
[25:44.870 --> 25:48.370]  you have to keep the probes wet or it will die.
[25:48.370 --> 25:49.870]  If it dries, it dies,
[25:49.870 --> 25:51.330]  is what they should teach you with the grow store.
[25:51.330 --> 25:53.850]  But they don't tell you that because then it dies
[25:53.850 --> 25:55.270]  and you have to buy a replacement.
[25:55.270 --> 25:56.590]  So make sure you keep that wet.
[25:56.590 --> 25:58.510]  Make sure you keep it covered if you can.
[25:58.510 --> 26:00.690]  What I like to do, what we do with the large grow,
[26:00.690 --> 26:02.250]  we've got a large container.
[26:02.690 --> 26:04.770]  We put some water in there and then set the pH pins in there
[26:04.770 --> 26:06.490]  to where all the probes are in the water.
[26:06.490 --> 26:07.770]  And they're all just sitting in a circle.
[26:07.770 --> 26:09.090]  And then in the morning, when everybody comes,
[26:09.090 --> 26:11.050]  they can just grab their pen, put the cap on it,
[26:11.050 --> 26:12.170]  then go work for a while.
[26:12.170 --> 26:14.410]  And then those pens will stay moist with the caps on there.
[26:14.410 --> 26:16.170]  And they can check the solution as their day goes on.
[26:16.170 --> 26:17.330]  Then they don't have to go wander around
[26:17.330 --> 26:18.810]  and try to find a pH pen.
[26:18.810 --> 26:20.530]  We try to have enough pH pens for everybody
[26:20.530 --> 26:22.810]  in the facilities if we can.
[26:22.810 --> 26:24.930]  But like I said, they break, they die.
[26:24.930 --> 26:26.310]  Shit happens with these things.
[26:26.310 --> 26:28.430]  I'm not sure if they're dying because of the guys
[26:28.430 --> 26:29.690]  or if they're dying just because
[26:29.690 --> 26:30.650]  that's what these things do.
[26:30.690 --> 26:32.610]  Because my personal pens have died also.
[26:32.610 --> 26:35.650]  And I like to think I take good care of my stuff.
[26:35.650 --> 26:38.330]  Anyway, you have to keep your probe clean.
[26:38.330 --> 26:40.470]  If you expect to rely on your equipment,
[26:40.470 --> 26:42.530]  you have to take good care of your equipment.
[26:42.530 --> 26:44.810]  So keep the probe clean on your pH meter.
[26:44.810 --> 26:47.110]  Also calibrate your meters regularly,
[26:47.110 --> 26:48.650]  depending on how much you're using it,
[26:48.650 --> 26:50.990]  depending on how much you're knocking it around.
[26:50.990 --> 26:51.970]  Just make sure you're cleaning it
[26:51.970 --> 26:54.310]  and calibrating it on a regular basis.
[26:54.310 --> 26:56.230]  I like to go for about once a week,
[26:56.230 --> 26:57.970]  maybe every two weeks at the most.
[26:57.970 --> 27:00.090]  A home grower, maybe you could get away with once a month,
[27:00.530 --> 27:02.650]  but I wouldn't press my luck too far.
[27:02.650 --> 27:05.850]  You can find a decent pH pen for around 40 bucks,
[27:05.850 --> 27:09.610]  or you can find a magnificent pH monitoring device
[27:09.610 --> 27:12.090]  with an EC meter and a thermometer on there.
[27:12.090 --> 27:15.750]  It's probably gonna cost you closer to 250, maybe 350.
[27:15.750 --> 27:18.850]  You can spend up to $1,000 on pH monitoring equipment.
[27:18.850 --> 27:21.450]  If you'd like to, you can get a device
[27:21.450 --> 27:24.010]  that you can put all of your nutrient bottles
[27:24.010 --> 27:27.210]  into this thing, and you can put your pH up and down,
[27:27.210 --> 27:31.010]  and you can tell it how much PPMs of each bottle you want
[27:31.010 --> 27:33.690]  poured into the mix, and then it'll pH it for you,
[27:33.690 --> 27:34.690]  and it'll feed the plants for you,
[27:34.690 --> 27:35.850]  if you really wanna spend that money.
[27:35.850 --> 27:37.490]  But if you just wanna get a pH pen,
[27:37.490 --> 27:39.690]  you can spend around 40, maybe 80 bucks
[27:39.690 --> 27:41.570]  will get you a really good one.
[27:41.570 --> 27:44.230]  Like I'm saying, if you wanna go high end and get the combo,
[27:44.230 --> 27:46.130]  go ahead and spend 250, 350 on it.
[27:46.130 --> 27:47.850]  The more you spend, the better.
[27:47.850 --> 27:48.810]  They are like that.
[27:48.810 --> 27:50.290]  Some equipment, the more you spend,
[27:50.290 --> 27:53.050]  you're just getting a better name or a better color.
[27:53.050 --> 27:54.770]  But I feel like with scientific equipment
[27:54.770 --> 27:56.270]  like pH monitors and such,
[27:56.270 --> 27:57.710]  you actually do get better stuff
[27:57.710 --> 27:59.010]  when you spend a little bit more money.
[27:59.010 --> 28:01.750]  So if you can drop the extra cash on a good pH meter,
[28:01.750 --> 28:03.610]  I recommend doing that.
[28:03.610 --> 28:07.430]  If you're old school, you can use the paper and the drops.
[28:07.430 --> 28:09.870]  It's a lot of work and kind of a pain in the ass to me,
[28:09.870 --> 28:11.890]  but it does work and it's reliable,
[28:11.890 --> 28:14.010]  and you never have to calibrate it.
[28:14.010 --> 28:15.470]  I've said before I like the pH,
[28:15.470 --> 28:17.870]  or the Bluelab Combo Meter.
[28:17.870 --> 28:20.510]  It's pH, EC, and temperature.
[28:20.510 --> 28:22.230]  People have all kinds of suggestions
[28:22.230 --> 28:23.870]  on how to adjust your pH.
[28:23.870 --> 28:28.350]  I recommend you actually buy a pH or pH down product.
[28:28.350 --> 28:29.990]  We're using high end nutrients
[28:29.990 --> 28:32.590]  with a lot of buffers in them, a lot of chelation.
[28:32.590 --> 28:33.870]  We're using expensive plants.
[28:33.870 --> 28:36.270]  We're running expensive crops, running expensive lights.
[28:36.270 --> 28:40.430]  We're expecting high output yields.
[28:40.430 --> 28:44.090]  Let's use something reliable and stable to adjust our pH.
[28:44.090 --> 28:45.950]  Don't go using some home remedy
[28:45.950 --> 28:48.270]  because our nutrients are going to wash that up.
[28:48.270 --> 28:49.930]  Our nutrients are going to eat it.
[28:49.930 --> 28:51.310]  It's going to evaporate.
[28:51.310 --> 28:53.350]  Then our pH is gonna swing like crazy
[28:53.350 --> 28:55.070]  because we didn't use the proper products.
[28:55.070 --> 29:00.070]  So use something reliable to stabilize your pH.
[29:00.790 --> 29:03.670]  So checking and adjusting the pH of your feed solution
[29:03.670 --> 29:05.610]  should become a habit,
[29:05.610 --> 29:07.030]  and you'll see the difference in your plants.
[29:07.030 --> 29:09.710]  It's a good idea to periodically check the pH
[29:09.710 --> 29:13.390]  even if you think you've got your mix dialed in.
[29:13.390 --> 29:16.170]  Sometimes your local water company
[29:16.170 --> 29:18.190]  will change the amount of chemicals
[29:18.190 --> 29:20.030]  or the type of chemicals they're using
[29:20.030 --> 29:22.070]  to treat your water in your area,
[29:22.070 --> 29:23.750]  and you will not be aware of it.
[29:23.750 --> 29:25.830]  If you're checking the pH of your solutions,
[29:25.830 --> 29:28.670]  you will catch these types of things and you can dial it in.
[29:28.670 --> 29:31.990]  Also, maybe your nutrient company made a change
[29:31.990 --> 29:35.030]  and you're not aware of that because that shit does happen.
[29:35.030 --> 29:38.310]  So I highly suggest you check and adjust your pH
[29:38.310 --> 29:41.090]  at every opportunity you get.
[29:41.090 --> 29:43.870]  It will increase the potency, it will increase the quality,
[29:43.870 --> 29:46.990]  and it will increase the yield of your crop.
[29:46.990 --> 29:50.230]  And who doesn't want more potent, better tasting herb?
[29:50.230 --> 29:52.750]  And of course, who doesn't want more of it?
[29:52.750 --> 29:56.010]  So that's my quick talk on adjusting your pH.
[29:56.010 --> 29:59.470]  I should talk a little bit about the pH scale.
[29:59.470 --> 30:02.210]  A lot of people are going to talk about
[30:02.210 --> 30:05.230]  how far off can 0.1 or 0.2 be,
[30:05.230 --> 30:08.230]  how big of a difference can that make when adjusting pH?
[30:08.230 --> 30:10.230]  It's just 0.1.
[30:10.230 --> 30:12.170]  It doesn't sound like that big of a deal.
[30:12.170 --> 30:16.190]  If I told you it's $1.10 or $1.20 or $1.30,
[30:16.190 --> 30:18.410]  10, 30 cents probably isn't gonna make
[30:18.410 --> 30:19.810]  much of a difference to you.
[30:21.070 --> 30:24.230]  But pH is measured on a very unique scale.
[30:24.230 --> 30:27.050]  It is a scale called, and I hope I pronounce this correctly,
[30:27.050 --> 30:28.490]  the logarithmic scale.
[30:30.310 --> 30:32.490]  I'll do my best to explain this.
[30:32.490 --> 30:35.310]  On Wikipedia, it takes about seven pages
[30:35.310 --> 30:37.430]  to explain the logarithmic scale.
[30:37.430 --> 30:39.850]  Keep in mind, you guys, I am attempting to condense
[30:39.850 --> 30:44.190]  seven pages of Wikipedia into about three sentences here,
[30:44.190 --> 30:45.310]  so follow me.
[30:45.310 --> 30:47.190]  And please don't be too critical of this.
[30:47.190 --> 30:48.630]  I'm just trying to give you an idea
[30:48.630 --> 30:49.990]  of why it's so important.
[30:50.910 --> 30:53.590]  The logarithmic scale and the way pH works
[30:53.590 --> 30:56.210]  is basically an exponent.
[30:56.210 --> 30:58.270]  So when you have a pH of six,
[30:58.270 --> 31:01.230]  let's just start with the number six, 6.0.
[31:01.230 --> 31:03.310]  You have got six, all right?
[31:03.310 --> 31:06.190]  Now if we move to 6.1,
[31:06.190 --> 31:08.390]  basically every time you move a number up,
[31:08.390 --> 31:10.290]  you are adding a zero.
[31:10.290 --> 31:12.550]  So 6.0 is 6.0.
[31:12.550 --> 31:15.510]  6.1 is 6.10.
[31:16.510 --> 31:20.070]  6.2 is 6.200.
[31:20.070 --> 31:24.630]  6.3 is 6.3000.
[31:24.630 --> 31:28.470]  6.4 is 6.40,000, and it keeps going like that.
[31:28.470 --> 31:30.270]  So you're not just moving one,
[31:30.270 --> 31:32.470]  you are moving an exponent of one.
[31:32.470 --> 31:34.830]  If you could see the math scale that is happening,
[31:34.830 --> 31:36.910]  the equation that's happening in that pH pen
[31:36.910 --> 31:40.230]  the entire time, you would understand how far off
[31:40.230 --> 31:42.950]  each .1 adjustment takes us
[31:42.950 --> 31:45.070]  from the original starting point.
[31:45.590 --> 31:47.590]  So that may not be the most scientific explanation,
[31:47.590 --> 31:50.270]  but I think it makes it more understandable
[31:50.270 --> 31:53.510]  for the audience to catch on of why it's so critical
[31:53.510 --> 31:58.330]  to stay as close as we can to our dialed in target pH.
[31:59.270 --> 32:01.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope that makes sense to you.
[32:01.230 --> 32:03.670]  I want to thank you for listening to this episode about pH.
[32:03.670 --> 32:04.770]  I hope you learned something.
[32:04.770 --> 32:08.510]  I hope you are able to improve the quality of your garden
[32:08.510 --> 32:10.350]  because of the advice I have given you today.
[32:10.350 --> 32:13.550]  Also, I hope to see you at the Fish Shows this weekend.
[32:13.790 --> 32:16.190]  Don't be shy, come up, give me a high five,
[32:16.190 --> 32:18.430]  say what's up to me, smoke a joint with me,
[32:18.430 --> 32:20.990]  give me a dab, no other drugs please,
[32:20.990 --> 32:22.710]  don't sneak me any fun shit.
[32:22.710 --> 32:26.070]  I just want to get stoned this weekend, we'll be all right.
[32:26.070 --> 32:27.730]  But I think that's all I've got for you this week.
[32:27.730 --> 32:29.510]  Make sure you stalk me on all of the social media.
