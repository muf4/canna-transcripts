[00:03.900 --> 00:31.360]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:31.360 --> 00:35.280]  It's time for episode 402 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:35.280 --> 00:38.840]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:38.840 --> 00:43.160]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:43.160 --> 00:49.080]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:49.080 --> 00:53.360]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:53.360 --> 00:58.100]  Today I've been taking dabs of vanilla cookies batter from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:58.100 --> 01:05.440]  The label says this concentrate has 79% THC and 94.4% total cannabinoids.
[01:05.440 --> 01:10.340]  This concentrate tastes delicious, and to tell you the truth, I am nicely medicated
[01:10.340 --> 01:11.340]  from this concentrate.
[01:11.340 --> 01:13.600]  It has got a nice, really heavy buzz.
[01:13.600 --> 01:14.820]  It's got me nice and mellow.
[01:14.820 --> 01:16.180]  I am just chilling out.
[01:16.180 --> 01:18.820]  I really like this concentrate.
[01:18.820 --> 01:22.000]  This episode is going to be another compilation of grow lessons.
[01:22.000 --> 01:31.120]  This is going to be a repost of episodes 359, 360, 362, 363, 64, and 365.
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.160]  Ladies and gentlemen, with no further ado, let's jump right back in to a long group of
[01:35.160 --> 01:36.160]  grow lessons.
[01:36.160 --> 01:39.970]  Ocean.
[01:39.970 --> 01:43.210]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[01:43.210 --> 01:47.170]  It's time for episode 359 of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:47.170 --> 01:50.650]  This episode of the show is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:50.650 --> 01:55.130]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[01:55.130 --> 01:59.730]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:59.730 --> 02:02.650]  I like to start the podcast off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:02.650 --> 02:07.890]  Today, I'm taking dabs of Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts.
[02:07.890 --> 02:11.690]  I really love the flavor and aroma of this concentrate.
[02:11.690 --> 02:16.570]  It smells like Jack Harrer and bubble gum, and when you dab it, it leaves a sweet, soft
[02:16.570 --> 02:21.170]  bubble gum flavor on your mouth that just lingers for a long time, and the high goes
[02:21.170 --> 02:22.370]  straight to the head.
[02:22.370 --> 02:24.590]  I really like this concentrate.
[02:24.590 --> 02:26.730]  One thing I am going to complain about is the packaging.
[02:26.730 --> 02:28.810]  These little plastic jars get stuck.
[02:28.810 --> 02:31.530]  The Fuego jars get stuck every time I buy them.
[02:31.530 --> 02:33.330]  It is a pain in the ass.
[02:33.330 --> 02:38.450]  Then they're putting the jar inside of a black bag with a drawstring, kind of like a little
[02:38.450 --> 02:40.370]  tiny Crown Royal bag.
[02:40.370 --> 02:44.330]  The jar has stickers on it to indicate the brand and the strain.
[02:44.330 --> 02:48.810]  The little black bag has a bunch of fibers that come off of it, so now I've got a jar
[02:48.810 --> 02:52.370]  that looks like it's got long black hairs hanging off of it.
[02:52.370 --> 02:53.810]  I don't like that at all.
[02:53.810 --> 02:54.810]  It's unappealing.
[02:54.810 --> 02:55.850]  There's no need for that bag.
[02:55.850 --> 02:57.670]  It's a waste of material.
[02:57.670 --> 03:01.730]  It's another step in the packaging process, and it is completely useless.
[03:01.730 --> 03:06.050]  Then after they've put the jar in that bag, they place that bag inside of another box,
[03:06.050 --> 03:10.530]  which slides into another box, which is all beautifully decorated and well-labeled.
[03:10.530 --> 03:11.610]  It is a lot of packaging.
[03:11.610 --> 03:15.770]  I'm sure most of that packaging is because of the Colorado compliance laws, but I would
[03:15.770 --> 03:18.250]  like to see less packaging from the Concentrate companies.
[03:18.250 --> 03:20.410]  I feel like I throw away a lot of packaging.
[03:20.410 --> 03:22.970]  All right, you guys, so let me be completely clear.
[03:22.970 --> 03:24.450]  The Concentrate is amazing.
[03:24.450 --> 03:26.850]  The Bubble Jack full spectrum extract tastes great.
[03:26.850 --> 03:27.850]  The high is perfect.
[03:27.850 --> 03:32.050]  My only complaint is with the packaging, and that is not just Fuego.
[03:32.050 --> 03:35.370]  I just happen to be using Fuego products today when I'm talking about this.
[03:35.370 --> 03:39.290]  A lot of the companies are using too much packaging, and I understand.
[03:39.290 --> 03:40.290]  It's Colorado law.
[03:40.290 --> 03:41.290]  We've got to be compliant.
[03:41.970 --> 03:42.970]  I get it.
[03:42.970 --> 03:45.850]  I just wish there was a way we could do this more efficiently and more environmentally
[03:45.850 --> 03:46.850]  friendly.
[03:46.850 --> 03:48.730]  All right, you guys, let's move forward with the show.
[03:48.730 --> 03:51.290]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[03:51.290 --> 03:55.330]  This is going to be the seventh lesson in a long series of grow lessons.
[03:55.330 --> 04:00.090]  In this episode, I want to talk about planning your integrated pest management.
[04:00.090 --> 04:02.210]  Everybody likes to think they will not get bugs.
[04:02.210 --> 04:04.970]  Everybody likes to say, that's not going to happen to me, but guess what?
[04:04.970 --> 04:05.970]  It will.
[04:05.970 --> 04:10.810]  The only way you can prevent it is by starting an integrated pest management system while
[04:11.330 --> 04:14.610]  you're planning your grow, while you're setting up your grow, and having it in place before
[04:14.610 --> 04:18.770]  you ever introduce plants into your grow environment.
[04:18.770 --> 04:21.330]  Let's talk a little bit about integrated pest management.
[04:21.330 --> 04:24.550]  What is the goal of our integrated pest management system?
[04:24.550 --> 04:29.170]  The ultimate goal is to keep our garden free of pests and bugs.
[04:29.170 --> 04:34.130]  A good spot to start would be knowing how to identify the bugs we are looking for and
[04:34.130 --> 04:36.170]  the damage that they will leave.
[04:36.170 --> 04:39.750]  What insects are we going to find in our cannabis garden?
[04:39.750 --> 04:44.230]  The most common problem we are going to find is spider mites.
[04:44.230 --> 04:46.210]  Spider mites are very small.
[04:46.210 --> 04:50.670]  You are very unlikely to see a spider mite unless you flip over a leaf and look at it
[04:50.670 --> 04:52.330]  and do some investigating.
[04:52.330 --> 04:55.230]  What you will see is spider mite damage.
[04:55.230 --> 04:58.810]  If you've got a leaf that looks like somebody has just been taking a needle and poking little
[04:58.810 --> 05:02.610]  dots in that leaf, or something's been sticking its fangs in there and sucking the juice out
[05:02.610 --> 05:06.050]  of those little spots, that is spider mite damage.
[05:06.050 --> 05:09.350]  Learn how to identify spider mite damage.
[05:09.350 --> 05:13.630]  If you see damage on a leaf, pull that leaf off, flip it upside down and look at the underside
[05:13.630 --> 05:14.630]  of the leaf.
[05:14.630 --> 05:18.750]  Along the main vein of that leaf, tucked right up against that vein, you will see spider
[05:18.750 --> 05:20.670]  mites and spider mite eggs.
[05:20.670 --> 05:23.470]  Those little dots you see, those are spider mite eggs.
[05:23.470 --> 05:26.610]  Those little itty bitty dots that are moving, those are the spider mites.
[05:26.610 --> 05:27.710]  They are there.
[05:27.710 --> 05:29.470]  It is time to treat for them.
[05:29.470 --> 05:33.190]  Depending on what cycle of growth you are in, treating for spider mites can be very
[05:33.190 --> 05:34.190]  easy.
[05:34.190 --> 05:37.170]  It can also be kind of a pain in the ass later and flower.
[05:37.170 --> 05:41.910]  If you learn how to identify spider mite damage and learn how to identify spider mites, finding
[05:41.910 --> 05:47.030]  the problem early and correcting it should not be a problem before it gets out of hand.
[05:47.030 --> 05:51.450]  Another pest that is very common in the garden and very easy to identify because of its damage
[05:51.450 --> 05:53.190]  is a thrip.
[05:53.190 --> 05:57.310]  A lot like a spider mite, the thrips like to suck the juice out of our plants.
[05:57.310 --> 06:01.710]  After they do this, they leave a little trail of gooey stuff called honeydew on the leaves.
[06:01.710 --> 06:06.630]  If you see a little trail of silvery, shiny, shimmery stuff left on your lower leaves,
[06:06.630 --> 06:08.770]  you probably have thrips.
[06:08.770 --> 06:13.210]  If we become familiar with what thrip damage looks like, we can identify the problem sooner
[06:13.210 --> 06:16.730]  and that makes it really easy to eradicate our problems.
[06:16.730 --> 06:21.610]  My point is, knowing what to look for will be seriously advantageous when it comes to
[06:21.610 --> 06:24.490]  treating for a pest problem.
[06:24.490 --> 06:27.850]  Another common pest you're going to run into is the whitefly.
[06:27.850 --> 06:28.850]  What does a whitefly look like?
[06:28.850 --> 06:32.650]  It looks like a little piece of ash just flying around, just a little whitefly.
[06:32.650 --> 06:33.850]  It'll start off with two of them.
[06:33.990 --> 06:35.750]  Then the next day, you'll see 200 of them.
[06:35.750 --> 06:38.590]  Then the next day, you'll see 2,000 of them.
[06:38.590 --> 06:43.870]  Whiteflies multiply rapidly, but once you see them, they are easy to get rid of if you
[06:43.870 --> 06:46.550]  understand how to combat them.
[06:46.550 --> 06:51.630]  The very first step of an integrated pest management system is learning to identify
[06:51.630 --> 06:55.390]  the damage caused by common garden pests.
[06:55.390 --> 06:59.390]  Once we know how to identify the problems, then we can identify the pest, then we can
[06:59.390 --> 07:03.230]  decide on the course of action to treat that problem.
[07:03.610 --> 07:07.770]  Also, it is very important to treat for the correct pest.
[07:07.770 --> 07:13.010]  Some pesticides will work on a broad spectrum of pests, but if you're using specific pesticides
[07:13.010 --> 07:19.110]  or if you're using specific predatory pests, you do need to use the correct method of attack.
[07:19.110 --> 07:23.950]  In today's market, we can't afford to spend money on a product that does not specifically
[07:23.950 --> 07:29.930]  attack our problem, and also, we can't spend time applying a product or releasing predators
[07:29.930 --> 07:33.970]  that are not going to get in there and eradicate our problems.
[07:33.970 --> 07:40.290]  Learn how to identify the signs, then identify the actual pest, then we can dial in and attack
[07:40.290 --> 07:42.330]  to eradicate our problem.
[07:42.330 --> 07:46.770]  Let's talk about a few ways we can prepare our grow and prevent pests from entering our
[07:46.770 --> 07:48.650]  new garden.
[07:48.650 --> 07:52.690]  Cleanliness is a huge factor when it comes to keeping bugs out of our garden.
[07:52.690 --> 07:55.890]  Everything that goes in that garden is taken in there by you.
[07:55.890 --> 07:57.170]  You travel in and out of there.
[07:57.170 --> 07:58.170]  You take things in and out.
[07:58.290 --> 08:03.290]  It is your responsibility to control what goes in and out of that grow.
[08:03.290 --> 08:08.950]  One way to prevent contaminating your garden is to have dedicated garden clothes.
[08:08.950 --> 08:10.130]  Don't come from a hike.
[08:10.130 --> 08:11.610]  Don't come from the grow store.
[08:11.610 --> 08:12.810]  Don't come from work.
[08:12.810 --> 08:15.450]  Don't go from wherever you are into your grow room.
[08:15.450 --> 08:17.930]  Have specific garden clothes.
[08:17.930 --> 08:19.010]  Change your clothes.
[08:19.010 --> 08:20.170]  Change your shoes.
[08:20.170 --> 08:21.210]  Change your hat.
[08:21.210 --> 08:24.010]  Don't take your daily clothing into your grow room.
[08:24.010 --> 08:25.330]  Who knows what's on you?
[08:25.330 --> 08:26.910]  Maybe you've been petting a dog.
[08:26.910 --> 08:29.510]  Maybe the dog was outside leaning against the tree.
[08:29.510 --> 08:30.990]  Maybe that tree had aphids.
[08:30.990 --> 08:33.430]  That dog came in, rubbed up against your leg.
[08:33.430 --> 08:35.870]  You and the dog spent a minute together scratching on each other.
[08:35.870 --> 08:37.150]  Then you went to the grow.
[08:37.150 --> 08:40.870]  You just took those aphids from the tree to the dog into your garden.
[08:40.870 --> 08:42.670]  Try to prevent that sort of thing.
[08:42.670 --> 08:44.270]  Be very careful.
[08:44.270 --> 08:46.670]  I've got dreadlocks down to my knees.
[08:46.670 --> 08:51.050]  I wrap my dreadlocks up in a specific hat before I go into any grow.
[08:51.050 --> 08:55.990]  If you've got dreadlocks or long hair, I suggest you put it in a hat of some sort, maybe a
[08:56.070 --> 08:57.310]  hairnet, whatever it takes.
[08:57.310 --> 08:59.070]  My hair would not fit in a hairnet.
[08:59.070 --> 09:01.390]  I wrap my dreads in a big bun on top of my head.
[09:01.390 --> 09:04.110]  I wrap that in a piece of material that wraps real tight.
[09:04.110 --> 09:07.230]  Then I slide a dreadlock hat over that so I'm double wrapped.
[09:07.230 --> 09:08.230]  Nothing will get in.
[09:08.230 --> 09:09.230]  Nothing will get out.
[09:09.230 --> 09:13.150]  I won't transfer any problems from grow to grow or room to room.
[09:13.150 --> 09:16.990]  If you've got dreadlocks or long hair, I highly recommend you keep it wrapped up, maybe in
[09:16.990 --> 09:20.570]  a hairnet or something similar, maybe a dread hat just where it's contained in there and
[09:20.570 --> 09:21.750]  not exposed.
[09:21.750 --> 09:25.630]  That way you can prevent moving spider mites around through your hair.
[09:25.630 --> 09:29.530]  Some of you guys with the big beards, you may want to consider a beardnet also, not
[09:29.530 --> 09:33.790]  just to prevent the bugs from getting into our hair, but also to prevent our hair from
[09:33.790 --> 09:34.910]  sticking to the buds.
[09:34.910 --> 09:38.190]  Nobody wants to buy a bud with a big hair in it.
[09:38.190 --> 09:41.230]  Change your clothes, keep your hair tied up, and then let's get back to that dog I was
[09:41.230 --> 09:42.230]  talking about.
[09:42.230 --> 09:44.630]  I don't recommend having pets in the grow room.
[09:44.630 --> 09:48.110]  I see a lot of pictures of people with their dog or their cat in the grow room talking
[09:48.110 --> 09:51.270]  about it's their guard dog or their mascot.
[09:51.270 --> 09:54.030]  That's cool if you want to do that, but I don't recommend it.
[09:54.030 --> 09:58.190]  Like I said earlier, your dog or your cat goes outside, it rolls around in the dirt,
[09:58.190 --> 10:01.270]  it rolls around in the bushes, it just goes everywhere.
[10:01.270 --> 10:02.990]  Who knows what it's getting into?
[10:02.990 --> 10:05.190]  Then you let it walk right into the garden.
[10:05.190 --> 10:08.370]  Maybe it walked up right up against a plant that was covered in spider mites and you had
[10:08.370 --> 10:09.370]  no idea.
[10:09.370 --> 10:13.630]  Now that dog is in your garden rubbing up against your plants, guess what?
[10:13.630 --> 10:15.670]  Free spider mites for everybody.
[10:15.670 --> 10:17.850]  I don't recommend having a pet in the grow.
[10:17.850 --> 10:20.510]  If you insist, do your thing, that is your grow.
[10:20.630 --> 10:25.790]  In my opinion, that is a huge risk for bringing bugs into your garden.
[10:25.790 --> 10:29.950]  Another thing I would recommend is that if you've got an outdoor grow and an indoor grow,
[10:29.950 --> 10:33.990]  don't bring your tools from that outdoor grow into your indoor grow environment.
[10:33.990 --> 10:36.270]  You may be bringing problems.
[10:36.270 --> 10:39.590]  Sometimes I know I sound like I might just be paranoid, but it's better to be paranoid
[10:39.590 --> 10:41.910]  than to make stupid mistakes.
[10:41.910 --> 10:45.270]  As long as you're changing your clothes, you're keeping your hair clean, you're keeping your
[10:45.270 --> 10:48.510]  shoes and your equipment clean, and you're not letting your dog or your friends in your
[10:48.510 --> 10:52.630]  grow room, there shouldn't be a way for any pests to get into this grow.
[10:52.630 --> 10:54.370]  You may have some cracks in the walls.
[10:54.370 --> 10:56.150]  There may be gaps in your building.
[10:56.150 --> 10:59.790]  That's always going to happen, but we're not going to drag them in there on our own.
[10:59.790 --> 11:02.390]  If they find a way in, we will deal with that.
[11:02.390 --> 11:06.070]  Now once you're certain you've minimized the opportunity for pests to enter your grow through
[11:06.070 --> 11:10.830]  your own doing, we need to think about treating the clones that come into our grow before
[11:10.830 --> 11:13.070]  they are introduced to population.
[11:13.070 --> 11:16.530]  Wherever your clones come from, if it's your best friend, if it's a dispensary, if it's
[11:16.690 --> 11:21.730]  some guy on Instagram, wherever they came from, treat them as if they are contaminated
[11:21.730 --> 11:24.070]  with some sort of pest issue.
[11:24.070 --> 11:29.530]  Never introduce clones into your general population without some sort of quarantine period.
[11:29.530 --> 11:32.250]  If your room is brand new, you don't have bugs.
[11:32.250 --> 11:35.210]  Why take plants in there that have bugs on them?
[11:35.210 --> 11:39.210]  We can treat those plants before we take them into our main grow room.
[11:39.210 --> 11:43.450]  If you've got a room with plants going, why would you want to introduce a plant with bugs
[11:43.450 --> 11:47.210]  on it into that room to contaminate the entire grow?
[11:47.210 --> 11:52.330]  If you get clones from anybody, isolate them, quarantine them, investigate them, get a jeweler's
[11:52.330 --> 11:57.070]  loop and go over the leaves and see if you can see any signs of bugs on the top or bottoms
[11:57.070 --> 11:58.370]  of those leaves.
[11:58.370 --> 12:02.850]  If you see any pests, now you have to decide if you want to keep that clone or if you're
[12:02.850 --> 12:07.410]  going to treat it and try to eradicate that problem before you introduce that clone to
[12:07.410 --> 12:09.290]  your general population.
[12:09.290 --> 12:12.810]  If I got a clone that had bugs on it, I would probably throw it away unless it were some
[12:13.170 --> 12:15.310]  super elite cut that I could never get again.
[12:15.310 --> 12:16.650]  Why start with problems?
[12:16.650 --> 12:19.830]  I wouldn't even allow that to make it past quarantine.
[12:19.830 --> 12:22.890]  If it looked like it was clean, I would still probably treat it.
[12:22.890 --> 12:26.850]  I would treat it with whatever pest management system I have decided to work with.
[12:26.850 --> 12:31.930]  If I'm using sprays and oils, I would heavily treat it with multiple oils several times.
[12:31.930 --> 12:34.370]  It would probably spend a week in quarantine.
[12:34.370 --> 12:36.650]  The first day, it would get blasted with something.
[12:36.650 --> 12:39.010]  On day three, it would get blasted with something different.
[12:39.010 --> 12:40.450]  On day five, something different.
[12:40.450 --> 12:41.450]  I'm never going to look at it.
[12:41.450 --> 12:45.210]  If I feel like it's safe and clean, it may enter general population on day seven or it
[12:45.210 --> 12:49.290]  may get treated one more time depending on how it looks to me.
[12:49.290 --> 12:53.850]  If I were working in a facility that did not use spray applications, I would put that plant
[12:53.850 --> 12:58.210]  in an isolated area with enough light and living conditions to survive for a few days.
[12:58.210 --> 13:01.450]  Then I would start heavily applying beneficial insects.
[13:01.450 --> 13:03.730]  I would build up a colony of predators on there.
[13:03.730 --> 13:06.570]  Hopefully they would go through and eat anything that was causing me a problem.
[13:06.570 --> 13:11.290]  By day seven, I would be safe to enter that clone into general population.
[13:11.290 --> 13:15.570]  But honestly, if I got a clone and it was contaminated, I probably would just destroy
[13:15.570 --> 13:16.570]  it.
[13:16.570 --> 13:18.370]  It wouldn't even make it past the inspection stage.
[13:18.370 --> 13:20.410]  It wouldn't even get into my grow.
[13:20.410 --> 13:25.530]  As a grower, it is your responsibility to check incoming clones and check them thoroughly
[13:25.530 --> 13:26.850]  no matter where they came from.
[13:26.850 --> 13:30.450]  If it came from your best friend, if it came from a dispensary, if it came from somebody
[13:30.450 --> 13:33.210]  on the internet, it is your responsibility.
[13:33.210 --> 13:37.170]  You cannot blame anybody for giving you a clone with bugs.
[13:37.170 --> 13:38.170]  That is your fault.
[13:38.170 --> 13:40.330]  It is not their fault.
[13:40.330 --> 13:43.570]  Treat any incoming plants as if they are contaminated.
[13:43.570 --> 13:47.530]  Isolate them, treat them, and continue to monitor them until you are certain the problem
[13:47.530 --> 13:50.770]  is not there or has been eradicated.
[13:50.770 --> 13:55.890]  Another very common way for people to get garden pests is through store-bought soil
[13:55.890 --> 13:57.530]  or soilless mix.
[13:57.530 --> 14:02.610]  A lot of people try to blame specific brands for being infested with specific bugs.
[14:02.610 --> 14:05.210]  I find that to be inaccurate.
[14:05.210 --> 14:06.490]  Think about it this way.
[14:06.490 --> 14:09.150]  Brand A is made in one area in California.
[14:09.150 --> 14:12.490]  Brand B is probably made in another area of California.
[14:12.490 --> 14:15.810]  Brand C, we'll just say that it's manufactured in Colorado.
[14:15.810 --> 14:17.250]  All three of those brands are made.
[14:17.250 --> 14:20.130]  Then they're all shipped to a warehouse.
[14:20.130 --> 14:24.290]  Sometimes these warehouses store their soil in pallets outdoors.
[14:24.290 --> 14:28.450]  If one of those pallets had a little bit of bugs in it, they started thriving in that
[14:28.450 --> 14:30.290]  one pallet of soil.
[14:30.290 --> 14:32.330]  Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[14:32.330 --> 14:33.890]  Then they moved over to the next pallet.
[14:33.890 --> 14:39.890]  Now they are in brands A, B, and C. There is no way to blame a specific soil company
[14:39.890 --> 14:40.890]  for giving you bugs.
[14:40.890 --> 14:44.690]  It was probably the warehouse in which all of those pallets were stored is where your
[14:44.690 --> 14:46.090]  bugs came from.
[14:46.090 --> 14:50.850]  Let's try to get away from blaming a specific brand for having specific bugs in there.
[14:50.850 --> 14:53.690]  That's unfair and probably inaccurate.
[14:53.690 --> 14:58.210]  It is a fact that our soil does come with bugs quite frequently.
[14:58.210 --> 15:01.090]  A lot of times you'll notice this when you're transplanting.
[15:01.090 --> 15:03.970]  You'll stick your hand in there and a little bug will just fly right up.
[15:03.970 --> 15:05.730]  It's usually a fungus gnat or a white fly.
[15:05.730 --> 15:07.730]  It'll just fly right up out of the soil.
[15:07.730 --> 15:08.730]  You know they're there.
[15:08.730 --> 15:13.770]  Now it's time to start thinking about how you're going to treat for those pests.
[15:13.770 --> 15:17.890]  Other times you don't see those soil-borne pests until the first time you water.
[15:17.890 --> 15:19.450]  You just potted all those pots.
[15:19.450 --> 15:21.930]  You got a whole bag worth of soil, worth of up pots done.
[15:21.930 --> 15:23.210]  You're feeling really good about life.
[15:23.210 --> 15:24.570]  You got the grow room all organized.
[15:24.570 --> 15:25.570]  You mix up your nutrients.
[15:25.570 --> 15:26.570]  You go to water.
[15:26.570 --> 15:30.690]  That first batch of water that hits that soil, you see little bugs come flying out.
[15:30.690 --> 15:31.690]  Those are fresh bugs.
[15:31.690 --> 15:33.170]  They came fresh with the soil.
[15:33.170 --> 15:37.450]  They're not a big deal as long as we know how to identify the insect and we know how
[15:37.450 --> 15:40.890]  to properly treat for that problem.
[15:40.890 --> 15:43.510]  Treating for soil-bound pests is very easy.
[15:43.510 --> 15:48.490]  You can either purchase predator insects that will get in there and eat that specific pest
[15:48.490 --> 15:53.050]  or we can mix up a root drench, which is a basic pesticide, and you mix it with water
[15:53.050 --> 15:56.770]  and then you water that into the plants just like you would when you normally water.
[15:56.770 --> 16:00.130]  Then that pesticide gets down in there in the root zone and then it will eradicate
[16:00.130 --> 16:02.170]  any pests that are in there.
[16:02.170 --> 16:06.690]  The things you're most commonly going to find in soil are going to be white flies.
[16:06.690 --> 16:12.370]  You'll probably find some fungus gnats and I quite often have found thrips in my soil.
[16:12.370 --> 16:14.550]  Just know that your soil may have bugs in it.
[16:14.550 --> 16:17.170]  Be aware, be looking and be prepared.
[16:17.170 --> 16:22.770]  Once you see some pests, identify them, then start thinking about eradication strategies.
[16:22.770 --> 16:27.130]  I do plan on giving you options for eradication strategies, but I'm not going to tell you
[16:27.130 --> 16:28.370]  what to do.
[16:28.370 --> 16:31.730]  There are countless options and variables when it comes to deciding your integrated
[16:31.730 --> 16:36.850]  pest management, but I want to give you guidance to let you decide and modify your own pest
[16:36.850 --> 16:41.290]  management system to where it fits with your grow style, with your grow environment, and
[16:41.290 --> 16:43.410]  also it's got to fit your budget.
[16:43.410 --> 16:46.570]  I'm going to give you a good guideline on how to take care of pests in your garden,
[16:46.570 --> 16:52.570]  but it is up to you to implement and modify these practices to work for you.
[16:52.570 --> 16:56.050]  We've covered most of the ways that we are going to introduce pests into a grow.
[16:56.050 --> 16:59.810]  Let's talk about the other ways pests are going to find their way into the grow.
[16:59.810 --> 17:02.850]  They're going to come in through your venting and your ducting.
[17:02.850 --> 17:06.850]  If you have any spots that are not sealed up, a spider mite or a little bug could just
[17:06.850 --> 17:08.210]  wiggle its way right through there.
[17:08.210 --> 17:10.170]  It's going to smell that sweet ganja plant.
[17:10.170 --> 17:13.170]  It's going to feel that warmth from the light and it's going to go, man, I want to be in
[17:13.170 --> 17:14.170]  there.
[17:14.170 --> 17:16.490]  And it's going to just go that way and then it's going to tell all of its friends, hey
[17:16.490 --> 17:19.410]  bro, I found a way in and they're just going to start parading in.
[17:19.410 --> 17:23.090]  So any cracks or gaps in your structure need to be sealed.
[17:23.130 --> 17:27.530]  If you can find a gap or a crack or a hole of some sort, put some caulk in there, put
[17:27.530 --> 17:32.010]  some tape over it, seal it up super tight so that the bugs cannot get in there.
[17:32.010 --> 17:36.050]  Now it's ideal to have a completely sealed room, but I understand that that is not always
[17:36.050 --> 17:37.890]  a viable option.
[17:37.890 --> 17:42.490]  Since we do have the opportunity to get bugs in there, our next step is to have a way to
[17:42.490 --> 17:45.770]  monitor and indicate the presence of pests.
[17:45.770 --> 17:50.650]  And the easiest way and most affordable and cost-effective way to do that is first by
[17:50.650 --> 17:51.650]  scouting.
[17:51.650 --> 17:56.410]  You don't have to spend time every day looking through your garden to see if you see any
[17:56.410 --> 17:59.930]  signs of bugs or bug damage.
[17:59.930 --> 18:01.370]  Scouting for bugs is free.
[18:01.370 --> 18:02.370]  It just takes time.
[18:02.370 --> 18:06.290]  Depending on the size of your grow, this could take anywhere from five minutes to a full
[18:06.290 --> 18:08.330]  hour, but it is important work.
[18:08.330 --> 18:11.690]  Put on some good music, get in the zone and scout for pests.
[18:11.690 --> 18:16.170]  Train everybody in the grow how to identify signs of pests and also teach them how to
[18:16.170 --> 18:18.670]  identify which pests they're dealing with.
[18:18.670 --> 18:23.430]  If you do discover pests, have a way to mark the plant and also mark on paper where it
[18:23.430 --> 18:24.670]  was in the facility.
[18:24.670 --> 18:28.710]  You probably have row numbers or room numbers, or if it's just a home grow, just plant number
[18:28.710 --> 18:30.310]  three or the plant in the middle.
[18:30.310 --> 18:33.730]  Just kind of mark down roughly where it is and then start thinking of a strategy.
[18:33.730 --> 18:37.710]  If you're not the one in charge of pest management, make sure you report that to the person above
[18:37.710 --> 18:38.710]  you.
[18:38.710 --> 18:39.710]  So just make a note of it.
[18:39.710 --> 18:43.070]  Write down what you found, what it looks like, what pest do you think it is, and then start
[18:43.070 --> 18:45.830]  doing research on how do we eradicate that pest.
[18:45.830 --> 18:47.710]  Start coming up with options.
[18:47.750 --> 18:49.270]  So scouting for bugs is free.
[18:49.270 --> 18:53.230]  You walk the rows, you turn the leaves upside down, you look, you look low in the canopy,
[18:53.230 --> 18:56.110]  you look high in the canopy, you look around.
[18:56.110 --> 18:57.670]  Feel free to pull a few leaves off.
[18:57.670 --> 19:00.670]  If you can't get a good look, reach in there, pop off a few leaves.
[19:00.670 --> 19:01.830]  Look at those under your scope.
[19:01.830 --> 19:03.450]  See if you see anything.
[19:03.450 --> 19:08.030]  You should be scouting for pests on a regular basis with some sort of a strategy.
[19:08.030 --> 19:12.550]  Now while you're out scouting for pests, you should check your yellow sticky cards.
[19:12.550 --> 19:17.110]  Every grow should have yellow sticky cards and they should be checked frequently and
[19:17.110 --> 19:19.950]  changed frequently as well.
[19:19.950 --> 19:22.430]  Yellow sticky cards are exactly what I'm saying.
[19:22.430 --> 19:24.050]  They're little yellow cards.
[19:24.050 --> 19:28.110]  They're about four inches by four inches or maybe four inches by six inches and they are
[19:28.110 --> 19:29.950]  bright yellow and they are sticky.
[19:29.950 --> 19:33.310]  They've got a disgusting glue on them that if you touch it, it's going to take all day
[19:33.310 --> 19:34.710]  to get that stuff off of you.
[19:34.710 --> 19:37.190]  Don't get one stuck to your elbow when you're working in the grow.
[19:37.190 --> 19:39.230]  If you've done it, you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[19:39.230 --> 19:41.470]  When you do it, you'll go, ah, that's what he meant.
[19:41.470 --> 19:44.590]  But you should have yellow sticky traps all over the grow.
[19:44.590 --> 19:49.310]  I like to put yellow sticky traps low down by the soil so that if I get any soil bound
[19:49.310 --> 19:52.230]  pests coming up out of the dirt, I get indicators of that.
[19:52.230 --> 19:54.710]  I like to put yellow sticky traps low in the canopy.
[19:54.710 --> 19:58.190]  So if I get any low flying stuff, I get indicators of that.
[19:58.190 --> 20:01.670]  I'll put stuff at the top of the canopy and then I'll also put stuff up near the light
[20:01.670 --> 20:05.070]  so that if anything flies into it, I get an indicator of that.
[20:05.070 --> 20:09.430]  And that is a really easy way to find out that you have got insects.
[20:09.430 --> 20:11.630]  Bugs love those yellow sticky traps.
[20:11.630 --> 20:13.470]  They say, wow, look how bright that is.
[20:13.470 --> 20:15.070]  That's a leaf that is weak.
[20:15.070 --> 20:18.510]  That's a leaf that's got a weak surface that I can get in there and really start sucking
[20:18.510 --> 20:20.230]  the juice out of without a lot of effort.
[20:20.230 --> 20:21.230]  I want to go to that.
[20:21.230 --> 20:25.230]  So the bugs run to that yellow sticky trap and they go, ah, shit, this is yellow sticky
[20:25.230 --> 20:26.230]  trap.
[20:26.230 --> 20:27.230]  I'm stuck here.
[20:27.230 --> 20:30.370]  And then we come in in the morning and we get to find out what kind of bugs were messing
[20:30.370 --> 20:34.990]  around in the garden, having a party while we were at home trying to get some rest.
[20:34.990 --> 20:39.150]  Yellow sticky traps are really affordable and they are a really early indicator of the
[20:39.150 --> 20:40.810]  presence of pests.
[20:40.810 --> 20:42.530]  So hang up your sticky traps.
[20:42.590 --> 20:44.290]  Check them on a daily basis.
[20:44.290 --> 20:49.230]  If you start seeing things stuck to them, investigate what that pest is and treat accordingly.
[20:49.230 --> 20:53.850]  Then hang up fresh sticky traps and see if that problem has gone away or if it has gotten
[20:53.850 --> 20:55.970]  worse or if anything new pops up.
[20:55.970 --> 20:59.290]  But if you're going to use the yellow sticky traps, there has to be some sort of method
[20:59.290 --> 21:00.370]  to your madness.
[21:00.370 --> 21:02.210]  You have to hang them strategically.
[21:02.210 --> 21:04.750]  You have to check them and you have to replace them.
[21:04.750 --> 21:08.190]  And if you see something, you have to react accordingly.
[21:08.190 --> 21:10.850]  So now we have two methods of finding bugs in our garden.
[21:10.850 --> 21:15.290]  We can use our own vision from scouting and then we can use yellow sticky traps to assist
[21:15.290 --> 21:16.290]  us.
[21:16.290 --> 21:20.990]  Our next step is to learn to use our integrated pest management system to continue to prevent
[21:20.990 --> 21:22.390]  infestations.
[21:22.390 --> 21:27.410]  And we also need to learn what to do if a pest infestation should occur.
[21:27.410 --> 21:31.950]  In a strategic pest management system, it's always wise to have preventative measures
[21:31.950 --> 21:32.990]  in place.
[21:32.990 --> 21:36.590]  Why wait until we've got bugs to start treating for bugs?
[21:36.590 --> 21:41.690]  Let's make it uncomfortable and undesirable for the pests we know may arrive.
[21:41.690 --> 21:45.710]  Now before we talk about options, let's talk a little bit about ethics.
[21:45.710 --> 21:48.090]  You can choose predator bugs.
[21:48.090 --> 21:50.170]  You can choose organic sprays.
[21:50.170 --> 21:52.850]  You can choose harsh chemical sprays.
[21:52.850 --> 21:57.890]  Whatever you choose to treat your garden is up to you.
[21:57.890 --> 22:00.770]  I encourage you to use something safe.
[22:00.770 --> 22:01.930]  Is it safe to you?
[22:01.930 --> 22:03.610]  Is it safe to the consumer?
[22:03.610 --> 22:04.890]  Is it safe to your pets?
[22:04.890 --> 22:07.830]  And is it overall safe to our environment?
[22:07.830 --> 22:11.670]  If you're going to smoke it yourself, spray whatever you are comfortable with spraying
[22:11.670 --> 22:12.670]  on your garden.
[22:12.670 --> 22:13.670]  That's yours.
[22:13.670 --> 22:14.670]  You can do whatever you want.
[22:14.670 --> 22:18.590]  I probably don't want to smoke it if you sprayed it with a few things, but if it's yours and
[22:18.590 --> 22:22.910]  you're sure it's not going anywhere, you can treat it however you are comfortable.
[22:22.910 --> 22:27.230]  If you have other consumers that are going to consume your product, keep their health
[22:27.230 --> 22:29.070]  and safety in mind.
[22:29.070 --> 22:32.010]  Not everybody is a young, healthy person.
[22:32.010 --> 22:37.310]  Some people may have underlying health issues that may be exacerbated by a pesticide or
[22:37.310 --> 22:39.870]  an essential oil or a botanical oil.
[22:39.870 --> 22:44.870]  Keep other people in mind if you are going to share, sell, or dispense your product in
[22:44.870 --> 22:46.110]  any sort of way.
[22:46.110 --> 22:50.870]  Then, of course, please make sure that your pest management system is environmentally
[22:50.870 --> 22:51.870]  friendly.
[22:51.870 --> 22:57.190]  We also need to keep in mind the long-term effects of whatever we choose to use.
[22:57.190 --> 23:01.990]  Beneficial mites will have a long-term environmental effect, but it is a much gentler effect than
[23:01.990 --> 23:05.130]  if we went outside and sprayed harsh chemicals.
[23:05.130 --> 23:06.630]  Think about long-term.
[23:06.630 --> 23:11.530]  Think about exposure, not just to the plants, the environment, the soil, your neighbor's
[23:11.530 --> 23:13.610]  gardens, but also to yourself.
[23:13.610 --> 23:17.730]  You've got to apply those chemicals or pesticides or botanical oils.
[23:17.730 --> 23:20.470]  Think about if they're going to harm you over time.
[23:20.470 --> 23:23.630]  Also think about ... This is something we don't think about often enough here, but I'm
[23:23.630 --> 23:25.790]  trying to gear myself more toward.
[23:25.790 --> 23:30.290]  Think about the ethics of the company that makes the products you are using.
[23:30.290 --> 23:31.690]  Does that company care?
[23:31.690 --> 23:33.190]  Do they care about the environment?
[23:33.190 --> 23:34.530]  Do they care about people?
[23:34.530 --> 23:36.050]  Do they care about cannabis?
[23:36.050 --> 23:38.410]  Are they opposed to cannabis?
[23:38.410 --> 23:42.490]  There are some companies out there that make products that are available at the hydro store
[23:42.490 --> 23:47.950]  that are completely opposed to cannabis and cannabis legalization.
[23:47.950 --> 23:51.530]  Why would we buy those products to support those people?
[23:51.530 --> 23:57.130]  When it comes to selecting a pesticide, understand the company, understand the product you're
[23:58.130 --> 24:03.410]  the active ingredient, and understand the effects of that ingredient in the long term.
[24:03.410 --> 24:07.130]  Understand what it's doing to yourself, understand what it's doing to your consumers, and try
[24:07.130 --> 24:10.010]  to understand what it does to the environment.
[24:10.010 --> 24:13.330]  Then really think about if that's something you can support, if that is something you
[24:13.330 --> 24:16.530]  would be proud to say you did, if that is something you would stand behind.
[24:16.530 --> 24:19.970]  If you're proud of it, if you can support it, and you'd put your signature on it, go
[24:19.970 --> 24:21.350]  ahead and use that product.
[24:21.350 --> 24:22.970]  Do what you're comfortable with.
[24:22.970 --> 24:25.330]  Now let's talk a little bit more about preventative.
[24:25.330 --> 24:27.290]  That's where I was headed with all of that.
[24:27.290 --> 24:28.450]  Preventative measures.
[24:28.450 --> 24:32.390]  It's okay to start treating for a pest problem before you see a pest problem.
[24:32.390 --> 24:35.370]  Why wouldn't we go ahead and make an undesirable environment?
[24:35.370 --> 24:37.170]  What are easy ways to do that?
[24:37.170 --> 24:40.650]  An easy way to do that is to already apply beneficial insects.
[24:40.650 --> 24:45.790]  Why not start a colony of beneficial bugs in our garden before the bad bugs even have
[24:45.790 --> 24:47.290]  a chance to take hold?
[24:47.290 --> 24:52.030]  You can start getting your persimilis, your swarskies, whatever you decide to use in there.
[24:52.030 --> 24:53.130]  Do a little bit of research.
[24:53.130 --> 24:55.570]  Make sure that you order the proper bugs that work for your environment.
[24:55.570 --> 24:59.930]  Your temperature and humidity will play a huge factor in the bugs that you need to order.
[24:59.930 --> 25:01.070]  But get some predators in there.
[25:01.070 --> 25:06.290]  Get the army established and get them started before the bad guys can even get started.
[25:06.290 --> 25:10.210]  Another route you can take is by spraying pesticide applications.
[25:10.210 --> 25:15.210]  You can use your essential oils, your botanical oils, or you can use your light or heavy chemical
[25:15.210 --> 25:16.810]  sprays, whatever you choose to use.
[25:16.810 --> 25:21.370]  You can start applying them before you see an insect infestation.
[25:21.370 --> 25:24.850]  That way, if a bug does try to creep down the ducting, it jumps on the plant and it
[25:24.850 --> 25:25.850]  goes, oh, fuck that.
[25:25.850 --> 25:27.010]  I don't want to be here at all.
[25:27.010 --> 25:28.010]  And it just tries to run.
[25:28.010 --> 25:29.370]  It doesn't invite its friends.
[25:29.370 --> 25:34.090]  You can create that undesirable environment before you even get an infestation.
[25:34.090 --> 25:37.670]  I would start with a schedule and a strategy.
[25:37.670 --> 25:41.250]  Decide that you're going to spray every so often, and then decide that you need to rotate
[25:41.250 --> 25:45.570]  your products this frequently, and then set a schedule and a routine.
[25:45.570 --> 25:48.970]  And then if you see anything, you can step up your game accordingly.
[25:48.970 --> 25:52.410]  We'll talk more about scheduling and strategy a little later.
[25:52.410 --> 25:56.730]  Now let's say we have been scouting and we have been doing our preventative sprays, and
[25:56.730 --> 25:59.450]  now we have discovered some pests.
[25:59.450 --> 26:00.890]  Now how do we treat them?
[26:00.890 --> 26:01.950]  What's the first step?
[26:01.950 --> 26:05.410]  The first step is to correctly identify your pest.
[26:05.410 --> 26:09.490]  On a commercial scale, it would save a lot of time and energy to treat for the correct
[26:09.490 --> 26:11.610]  pest the first time.
[26:11.610 --> 26:15.070]  So the first step is to correctly identify our pest.
[26:15.190 --> 26:19.430]  The next step is to think about how do we want to treat this problem.
[26:19.430 --> 26:20.950]  Do we want to use predators?
[26:20.950 --> 26:23.110]  Do we want to use horticultural oils?
[26:23.110 --> 26:24.790]  Do we want to use botanical sprays?
[26:24.790 --> 26:26.670]  Do we want to get in there with essential oils?
[26:26.670 --> 26:31.390]  Or do we want to step up our game and start using light pesticides or maybe even stronger
[26:31.390 --> 26:32.390]  pesticides?
[26:32.390 --> 26:33.390]  This is where we have to think about that.
[26:33.390 --> 26:37.630]  A lot of the essential oils and the hippie products aren't going to get rid of a strong
[26:37.630 --> 26:38.710]  infestation.
[26:38.710 --> 26:42.150]  That's where you'll need to step up to a mild pesticide.
[26:42.150 --> 26:44.310]  A lot of the pesticides are organic.
[26:44.310 --> 26:46.630]  A lot of those will work for you.
[26:46.630 --> 26:50.110]  If you've got a serious infestation and you don't want to deal with some organic stuff,
[26:50.110 --> 26:52.470]  you can step your way up to more harsh chemicals.
[26:52.470 --> 26:56.230]  But like I said, those are toxic and they become dangerous and you need to think about
[26:56.230 --> 26:59.390]  the ethics of what you are giving to other people.
[26:59.390 --> 27:03.230]  Now if you're trying to stay more organic, if you're doing a TLO sort of setup, you can
[27:03.230 --> 27:05.170]  introduce predator bugs.
[27:05.170 --> 27:06.590]  Predators are expensive.
[27:06.590 --> 27:10.110]  You also have to have specific insects to battle specific insects.
[27:10.110 --> 27:13.430]  You can't just release one thing and expect it to go take care of any bug that you may
[27:13.550 --> 27:14.550]  get.
[27:14.550 --> 27:15.830]  So predators are an option.
[27:15.830 --> 27:17.390]  They're also time consuming.
[27:17.390 --> 27:19.230]  You have to get out there and let them go.
[27:19.230 --> 27:20.230]  You have to apply.
[27:20.230 --> 27:23.350]  They either come in satchets or they come in a bottle with a little spout.
[27:23.350 --> 27:24.630]  You got to let them out somehow.
[27:24.630 --> 27:26.530]  They have to be dispersed through the garden.
[27:26.530 --> 27:30.110]  So they are time consuming, but they are organic.
[27:30.110 --> 27:31.770]  They are 100% organic.
[27:31.770 --> 27:35.110]  You're not applying anything to the garden that's going to change the flavor.
[27:35.110 --> 27:38.430]  You're not putting any chemicals on there that may make anybody else sick and they are
[27:38.430 --> 27:39.910]  completely safe.
[27:39.910 --> 27:40.950]  So you found a pest.
[27:40.950 --> 27:42.310]  You identified the pest.
[27:42.310 --> 27:45.950]  You've done some research on products that will help you get rid of that pest, either
[27:45.950 --> 27:48.870]  beneficial bugs or pesticide sprays.
[27:48.870 --> 27:51.910]  And now you've decided to apply that product.
[27:51.910 --> 27:57.610]  Now keep in mind, if we apply the same product to a pest too many times, those bugs will
[27:57.610 --> 27:59.630]  develop a resistance.
[27:59.630 --> 28:01.310]  So you'll see a bug, you'll treat it.
[28:01.310 --> 28:02.510]  It'll look like it's gone.
[28:02.510 --> 28:03.510]  It'll come back.
[28:03.510 --> 28:05.150]  You'll spray for that bug again.
[28:05.150 --> 28:06.150]  You'll think it's gone.
[28:06.150 --> 28:07.790]  A couple of weeks later, it'll come back.
[28:07.790 --> 28:09.270]  You'll spray twice as hard.
[28:09.270 --> 28:11.830]  It'll come back and it won't show up for a long time.
[28:11.830 --> 28:14.990]  When it does come back, you won't be able to spray it down with the product you've been
[28:14.990 --> 28:15.990]  using before.
[28:15.990 --> 28:17.270]  You'll have to switch it up.
[28:17.270 --> 28:21.910]  So to prevent that, I recommend using multiple modes of attack.
[28:21.910 --> 28:25.950]  And don't forget that if the pesticides work together and don't cause a chemical problem
[28:25.950 --> 28:30.590]  together, and don't disrupt the plant health, you can mix more than one pesticide in a tank
[28:30.590 --> 28:31.590]  together.
[28:31.590 --> 28:33.670]  I've done an episode about it titled Tank Mix.
[28:33.670 --> 28:36.350]  Don't be afraid to mix multiple products together.
[28:36.350 --> 28:40.190]  So you mix your products, you give it a good shake, you apply to your plants.
[28:40.190 --> 28:44.950]  I would say give it two or three days, then apply a different mix.
[28:44.950 --> 28:49.550]  Then if you still see the presence of bugs, apply a different mix.
[28:49.550 --> 28:53.630]  Don't go at it with the same product over and over because they will develop a resistance
[28:53.630 --> 28:54.630]  to it.
[28:54.630 --> 28:57.870]  Earlier, I said we would talk about scheduling and strategy.
[28:57.870 --> 29:03.430]  So let's talk about a more scheduled and detailed integrated pest management strategy.
[29:03.430 --> 29:09.310]  Here is a quick rundown of my scheduling and my strategy for pest management in a grow.
[29:09.430 --> 29:14.390]  So everything I mention is approved by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division and
[29:14.390 --> 29:16.590]  also the Colorado Department of Ag.
[29:16.590 --> 29:21.470]  I cannot apply a pesticide that is on the banned list or that has not been approved
[29:21.470 --> 29:23.670]  for use in a commercial grow.
[29:23.670 --> 29:27.870]  So everything I'm using is approved by the state of Colorado.
[29:27.870 --> 29:33.870]  Now to start my pest management system, every Monday, I apply a specific pesticide regimen
[29:33.870 --> 29:39.150]  to all of my vegetative plants, my small veg, my large veg, my mother plants, and the
[29:39.150 --> 29:41.150]  clones that are rooted and in pots.
[29:41.150 --> 29:43.910]  They all get sprayed with a pesticide.
[29:43.910 --> 29:47.870]  Depending on the size of the plant, I may spray them with a little more potent mix.
[29:47.870 --> 29:49.350]  I may spray them with a lighter mix.
[29:49.350 --> 29:50.910]  I may spray with just one product.
[29:50.910 --> 29:53.290]  I may mix up multiple products at a time.
[29:53.290 --> 29:56.390]  But every Monday, those plants are getting treated.
[29:56.390 --> 30:00.650]  I also write down exactly what I sprayed on each plant.
[30:00.650 --> 30:03.630]  That way next week, I know I can switch my pesticide.
[30:03.630 --> 30:07.830]  I can spray something different next week to prevent a resistance.
[30:07.830 --> 30:11.110]  Now I know that my plants have got a protective barrier.
[30:11.110 --> 30:15.510]  There's a little protection going on to prevent from getting pests in the room.
[30:15.510 --> 30:21.030]  If you're using lighter sprays, if you're using botanical oils or essential oils, you
[30:21.030 --> 30:24.030]  may want to up your spray regimen to twice a week.
[30:24.030 --> 30:28.750]  If those things don't stick around very long, you may want to apply them more frequently.
[30:28.750 --> 30:33.510]  So have a weekly spray schedule in place and try to switch up your products so that you
[30:33.510 --> 30:37.430]  can prevent your pests from building any type of resistance.
[30:38.030 --> 30:42.190]  Now when you're in there applying the sprays, spray the undersides of the leaves.
[30:42.190 --> 30:45.310]  You'll notice the spider mites are on the underside of the leaves.
[30:45.310 --> 30:46.790]  Why not spray there?
[30:46.790 --> 30:51.030]  So start at the bottom of the plant and start spraying the underside of the leaf and work
[30:51.030 --> 30:52.750]  your way up the plant to the top.
[30:52.750 --> 30:55.350]  And you will saturate the entire grow this way.
[30:55.350 --> 30:59.350]  Try to cover all of the plants just to the point of runoff, right to when they start
[30:59.350 --> 31:00.350]  dripping.
[31:00.350 --> 31:03.790]  Specific products will have specific guidelines, but I recommend you spray right to where they
[31:03.790 --> 31:04.830]  start running off.
[31:04.830 --> 31:07.190]  You just want to saturate that plant.
[31:07.230 --> 31:09.990]  You don't want to leave any desirable space for a pest.
[31:09.990 --> 31:13.150]  So get in there and spray once, maybe twice a week.
[31:13.150 --> 31:16.510]  And you can do this throughout the vegetative stage.
[31:16.510 --> 31:20.390]  Now once we start approaching the flower phase, we need to think about what we are going to
[31:20.390 --> 31:23.470]  do for pest management during the bloom phase.
[31:23.470 --> 31:30.230]  In a typical commercial grow, I would generally apply approved pesticides until day 14 or
[31:30.230 --> 31:32.230]  15 of the flowering phase.
[31:32.230 --> 31:36.990]  I may go in there the first day of the third week and hit that room one last time if I've
[31:36.990 --> 31:41.530]  had any problems, just to make sure those bugs aren't coming back.
[31:41.530 --> 31:44.830]  If you don't have any buds building yet, if you're just starting to get bud set, you should
[31:44.830 --> 31:48.910]  be okay with one final spray if you were selective with your products.
[31:48.910 --> 31:53.110]  Now if you haven't seen any bugs, you can taper off your spray applications earlier
[31:53.110 --> 31:58.030]  in flower, and that's when we can start to introduce our beneficial and predator insects.
[31:58.030 --> 32:01.470]  Now the beneficial insects work just like pesticide applications.
[32:01.470 --> 32:05.030]  You have to reapply them at specified intervals.
[32:05.070 --> 32:09.190]  Most of the vendors that provide live bugs are willing to set you up on a schedule to
[32:09.190 --> 32:12.230]  where you will receive the same order every week.
[32:12.230 --> 32:14.270]  That way you can rely on it coming.
[32:14.270 --> 32:15.270]  It'll show up at the grow.
[32:15.270 --> 32:16.670]  You'll say, hey, look, they're here.
[32:16.670 --> 32:18.950]  And then you've got to hang them because they're right there in your face.
[32:18.950 --> 32:20.470]  You can't forget, you can't put it off.
[32:20.470 --> 32:21.470]  They're alive.
[32:21.470 --> 32:25.430]  So that's a good way to get yourself on a good regimen and a good schedule of getting
[32:25.430 --> 32:27.030]  the live bugs out.
[32:27.030 --> 32:31.830]  So in a commercial grow, we basically work with spray applications until we see bud set.
[32:31.830 --> 32:34.070]  That's when we switch to the predator bugs.
[32:34.110 --> 32:38.310]  Make sure to taper off your spray application to where it doesn't destroy your predator
[32:38.310 --> 32:39.310]  bugs.
[32:39.310 --> 32:42.910]  Now, if you've been releasing your predators on your schedule and you start seeing spider
[32:42.910 --> 32:47.470]  mites, you can order fast release predators that will get in there and eat those spider
[32:47.470 --> 32:48.470]  mites for you.
[32:48.470 --> 32:51.570]  They come in a bottle with a little spout and they are hungry.
[32:51.570 --> 32:55.150]  You turn the spout, you open that bottle, you point that bottle at a leaf and the spider
[32:55.150 --> 32:58.190]  mite, the predator mites that are in there start marching out.
[32:58.190 --> 33:01.310]  They go and destroy the spider mite colonies.
[33:01.310 --> 33:05.670]  So if you start seeing an infestation during flower and you're already putting out the
[33:05.670 --> 33:09.250]  bugs, you just need to step up the bugs and try to ride it out through flower.
[33:09.250 --> 33:14.870]  You can defoliate, take any spider mite infested leaves out of there, get them out of the room.
[33:14.870 --> 33:17.270]  Don't go into a different room after that.
[33:17.270 --> 33:20.990]  Don't drag the bugs from the dirty room to the clean room on your clothes.
[33:20.990 --> 33:24.350]  Try to start the day working in the clean room and then work your way through to the
[33:24.350 --> 33:29.430]  dirtiest rooms and try to work on the bug infested room very last if that is an option.
[33:29.430 --> 33:33.190]  So if you've done everything correctly, you won't see spider mites late in flower, but
[33:33.190 --> 33:38.150]  if you do and you're using beneficial insects, you've got the option to apply more beneficial
[33:38.150 --> 33:39.150]  insects.
[33:39.150 --> 33:42.630]  I don't recommend spraying flowering plants with anything.
[33:42.630 --> 33:45.850]  Once you have bud set, everything you spray on there, you will taste it.
[33:45.850 --> 33:49.310]  If not in the flower, you will taste it in the concentrates.
[33:49.310 --> 33:54.470]  So if you do notice a presence of bugs late in flower in your flowering room and you were
[33:54.470 --> 34:00.110]  using beneficial insects as your pest management system, or if you're using sprays as your
[34:00.110 --> 34:04.510]  pest management system, it is time to step your game up in your vegetative areas.
[34:04.510 --> 34:08.710]  We need to eliminate the pests in veg because if you've got them in flower, they are in
[34:08.710 --> 34:13.590]  veg and we need to start getting rid of them and having a clean grow before we move stuff
[34:13.590 --> 34:17.990]  into the flower room because like I've mentioned, once we get past week three, we can't really
[34:17.990 --> 34:19.190]  spray those plants.
[34:19.190 --> 34:23.150]  We can only treat them with bugs and that takes time to build up.
[34:23.150 --> 34:27.590]  So let's focus on getting the plants clean and pest free before we even move them to
[34:27.590 --> 34:29.230]  that stage.
[34:29.230 --> 34:31.510]  A lot of people try to focus on the flowering plants.
[34:31.510 --> 34:33.190]  They want to get those pest free.
[34:33.190 --> 34:34.430]  Those are on their way out.
[34:34.430 --> 34:35.910]  Let's focus on the moms.
[34:35.910 --> 34:39.130]  Let's go all the way to the beginning and get the mother plants very clean.
[34:39.130 --> 34:41.110]  Let's get the source material clean.
[34:41.110 --> 34:43.230]  Let's work on keeping the clones clean.
[34:43.230 --> 34:45.350]  Let's learn how to get the veg room immaculate.
[34:45.350 --> 34:48.790]  So that way when we move into the flower room, we don't have to battle bugs.
[34:48.790 --> 34:49.970]  We don't have to battle pests.
[34:49.970 --> 34:54.450]  We can focus on building those fat juicy buds and delicious trichomes that we're all
[34:54.450 --> 34:55.450]  after.
[34:55.450 --> 34:58.570]  Now, one thing I do recommend is write down all of your sprays.
[34:58.570 --> 35:02.210]  If you were working in a commercial grow, you were required to write down all of your
[35:02.210 --> 35:03.210]  sprays.
[35:03.210 --> 35:04.810]  You have to write down the date, the time.
[35:04.810 --> 35:09.730]  You also have to write down the name of every product and the EPA number of every product
[35:09.730 --> 35:12.330]  and the amount of every product that you applied.
[35:12.330 --> 35:15.970]  You have to write down the REI of each product that you applied.
[35:15.970 --> 35:18.610]  You have to write down the lot number of plants.
[35:18.610 --> 35:21.850]  There's a lot of documenting to be done in a commercial grow.
[35:21.850 --> 35:25.810]  I recommend you do the same thing in your private grow just for peace of mind.
[35:25.810 --> 35:27.650]  It's always nice to have records.
[35:27.650 --> 35:31.610]  And if you do end up working in a commercial grow, you've already got experience writing
[35:31.610 --> 35:33.290]  down what you've been using.
[35:33.290 --> 35:39.730]  Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people that will not agree with my pesticide spray application
[35:39.730 --> 35:40.730]  regimen.
[35:40.730 --> 35:41.970]  That is just fine with me.
[35:41.970 --> 35:44.450]  I like that people have different opinions.
[35:44.450 --> 35:47.610]  That's just the method that I use in a commercial environment.
[35:47.610 --> 35:49.850]  That's what has been proven to work for me.
[35:49.850 --> 35:53.590]  It has been proven to be cost-effective, and it is something that I can train other employees
[35:53.590 --> 35:57.090]  to do on a repeatable basis.
[35:57.090 --> 36:01.290]  Just like all other aspects of growing cannabis, the options for integrated pest management
[36:01.290 --> 36:02.370]  are endless.
[36:02.370 --> 36:06.210]  And as long as it's making you happy, as long as you are satisfied with the results, keep
[36:06.210 --> 36:07.210]  doing it.
[36:07.210 --> 36:11.530]  All right, podcast world, that is my quick talk on integrated pest management.
[36:11.530 --> 36:13.610]  I know I didn't recommend any products.
[36:13.610 --> 36:15.530]  I didn't recommend any specific vendors.
[36:15.530 --> 36:17.730]  I did not recommend any brands.
[36:17.730 --> 36:22.490]  My goal was to give you an idea of how to start your own custom-tailored integrated
[36:22.490 --> 36:23.930]  pest management.
[36:23.930 --> 36:27.450]  Now you know what to expect, and you've got a few options on how to prevent and how to
[36:27.450 --> 36:28.690]  treat those things.
[36:28.690 --> 36:34.530]  Now you can customize that program to work for your grow, your budget, and your style.
[36:34.530 --> 36:38.410]  If you've got any questions or comments about this podcast, I would love to hear from you.

[36:57.770 --> 37:00.510]  Ladies and gentlemen, I made it 35 minutes without taking a break.
[37:00.510 --> 37:01.970]  My voice is burning out.
[37:01.970 --> 37:04.570]  I want to thank you for hanging out for this long episode.
[37:04.570 --> 37:06.770]  I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode.
[37:06.770 --> 37:09.730]  I want to give a huge shout out to Stabby McStabberson.
[37:09.730 --> 37:14.210]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[37:14.210 --> 37:15.490]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[37:15.490 --> 37:19.210]  It's time for episode 360 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[37:19.210 --> 37:22.270]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[37:22.270 --> 37:26.810]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[37:26.810 --> 37:30.970]  you can find them at dankseed.store.
[37:30.970 --> 37:34.570]  You guys know I like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[37:34.570 --> 37:39.410]  Today I'm taking dabs of Bubble Jack FSC from Fuego Extracts.
[37:40.090 --> 37:41.970]  I really love the flavor of this stuff.
[37:41.970 --> 37:43.330]  It tastes like bubble gum.
[37:43.330 --> 37:45.250]  The flavor just lingers on my tongue.
[37:45.250 --> 37:46.250]  I really like it.
[37:46.250 --> 37:49.150]  There's a little information printed on the side of the package here.
[37:49.150 --> 38:01.210]  It's got a lab test that says 71.83% max THC, 2.85% CBGA, and it's got 9.98% terpenes.
[38:01.210 --> 38:05.730]  I really enjoy this concentrate, that bubble gum, cotton candy flavor that just lingers
[38:05.730 --> 38:07.250]  on the tongue is perfect.
[38:07.250 --> 38:10.710]  And then that head high that goes straight to the brain and keeps you rambling, keeps
[38:10.710 --> 38:12.370]  you motivated is perfect.
[38:12.370 --> 38:17.490]  So a big two thumbs up to the Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract from Fuego Extracts.
[38:17.490 --> 38:19.730]  I really do enjoy smoking this.
[38:19.730 --> 38:23.530]  All right, you guys, let's keep moving this show forward because I have got a lot to talk
[38:23.530 --> 38:24.530]  about.
[38:24.530 --> 38:26.770]  We're going to get back into the grow lessons on this episode.
[38:26.770 --> 38:30.850]  This is going to be the eighth lesson in a long series of grow lessons.
[38:30.850 --> 38:35.090]  So far we've talked about our goals and ideas and where to set up our grow.
[38:35.450 --> 38:36.530]  We've gone over the equipment.
[38:36.530 --> 38:37.650]  We've talked about the lights.
[38:37.650 --> 38:38.970]  We've talked about our containers.
[38:38.970 --> 38:40.810]  We've talked about soil and medium.
[38:40.810 --> 38:42.210]  We've talked about pest control.
[38:42.210 --> 38:47.650]  And if you're not caught up, I recommend you go back to episode 351 and start there.
[38:47.650 --> 38:49.650]  There are a couple of interruptions in the lessons.
[38:49.650 --> 38:54.090]  I will sneak in a few episodes that are not grow lessons while I'm doing this series.
[38:54.090 --> 38:55.770]  Sometimes I'll need to read emails.
[38:55.770 --> 38:57.530]  Sometimes I'll need to answer questions.
[38:57.530 --> 39:01.370]  Coming up, we're going to have some iTunes customer reviews, things like that will disrupt
[39:01.370 --> 39:03.930]  the lessons, but I think it keeps the shows fresh.
[39:03.930 --> 39:06.730]  It keeps me motivated and it keeps it fun.
[39:06.730 --> 39:09.490]  But in this episode, we will continue the grow lessons.
[39:09.490 --> 39:13.610]  But before we get there, let's talk about a couple of things I kind of overlooked while
[39:13.610 --> 39:16.410]  we were talking about building our grow.
[39:16.410 --> 39:20.410]  It might be a good idea to add a smoke detector to each grow room.
[39:20.410 --> 39:24.490]  Wherever you've got a grow light hanging, have a smoke detector in that room.
[39:24.490 --> 39:29.090]  Also, I would recommend a fire extinguisher outside of each grow room.
[39:29.090 --> 39:33.410]  Now, I hope you don't have to use it, but if that smoke alarm goes off, you would rather
[39:33.410 --> 39:38.010]  have that fire extinguisher outside of the grow room so you don't have to open the door,
[39:38.010 --> 39:41.490]  run in there, get the fire extinguisher, then start working on the fire.
[39:41.490 --> 39:44.130]  If it's outside of the grow room, you can just grab it.
[39:44.130 --> 39:45.730]  You can be a little more prepared.
[39:45.730 --> 39:46.730]  You can get in there.
[39:46.730 --> 39:48.130]  You can start putting out the fire.
[39:48.130 --> 39:52.390]  Also, if you've never used a fire extinguisher, maybe read the instructions.
[39:52.390 --> 39:55.290]  Maybe understand what to do in case of a fire.
[39:55.290 --> 39:57.370]  Maybe just read that little book that comes with it.
[39:57.370 --> 39:59.650]  And also, make sure it stays charged.
[39:59.650 --> 40:00.850]  It's got a gauge on it.
[40:00.850 --> 40:02.850]  It's got a red, a yellow, and a green.
[40:02.850 --> 40:05.930]  Make sure your little arrow is in the green at all times.
[40:05.930 --> 40:09.610]  You might want to think about some sort of automated fire suppression system.
[40:09.610 --> 40:12.010]  They make things that hang in the middle of the grow room.
[40:12.010 --> 40:13.410]  It's got a little heat sensor in it.
[40:13.410 --> 40:15.870]  If it gets too hot, it basically explodes.
[40:15.870 --> 40:20.010]  It releases a powder that rains down into the grow room that will put out any fire that's
[40:20.010 --> 40:21.390]  in the room.
[40:21.390 --> 40:26.130]  Think about some sort of way to detect and suppress a fire in your grow room should that
[40:26.130 --> 40:28.210]  situation occur.
[40:28.210 --> 40:32.410]  Another thing I overlooked when we were designing and building our room was an automated watering
[40:32.450 --> 40:34.570]  system or an assisted watering system.
[40:34.570 --> 40:39.090]  An automated watering system can really speed things up once you get into a larger grow.
[40:39.090 --> 40:43.490]  It also makes the plants really happy because the plants love consistency.
[40:43.490 --> 40:47.930]  If you're interested in designing an auto watering system, I did a full episode about
[40:47.930 --> 40:50.330]  auto watering on episode 335.
[40:50.330 --> 40:55.250]  Unfortunately, there were some audio technical difficulties and parts of the episode chop
[40:55.250 --> 40:56.250]  out.
[40:56.250 --> 41:00.550]  If you listened to that episode and you still have specific questions, send me an email
[41:00.550 --> 41:05.510]  at growfromyourheartathotmail.com and we will get your auto water system dialed in.
[41:05.510 --> 41:10.830]  All right, so at this point, we should have goals and reasonable expectations for our
[41:10.830 --> 41:11.830]  grow.
[41:11.830 --> 41:14.230]  We should have a good idea of where we want to put the grow.
[41:14.230 --> 41:18.790]  We should have a good idea of the gear we want to buy, the lights, the pots, the medium.
[41:18.790 --> 41:21.310]  We should also have a good idea of pest control.
[41:21.310 --> 41:23.830]  Now we've talked a little bit about fire suppression.
[41:23.830 --> 41:26.930]  I've also done an in-depth episode on fire suppression.
[41:26.930 --> 41:28.690]  That is episode 260.
[41:28.690 --> 41:33.770]  If you want to learn a lot about fire safety in your grow, episode number 260 will teach
[41:33.770 --> 41:35.290]  you a lot there.
[41:35.290 --> 41:40.810]  If you decide you want to add an auto watering system to your grow, episode 335 is the episode
[41:40.810 --> 41:42.530]  all about auto watering.
[41:42.530 --> 41:44.210]  That should get us all caught up.
[41:44.210 --> 41:45.330]  The room is ready.
[41:45.330 --> 41:46.530]  We've got the gear planned out.
[41:46.530 --> 41:48.610]  We've got a good idea of pest management.
[41:48.610 --> 41:50.050]  We know what we're going to feed the plants.
[41:50.050 --> 41:51.650]  We know how to take care of a fire.
[41:51.650 --> 41:54.610]  We know how to set up an auto watering system if we need one.
[41:54.610 --> 41:57.010]  Now we're getting to the fun part of this journey.
[41:57.010 --> 41:59.710]  Let's start thinking about plants.
[41:59.710 --> 42:01.050]  What do you want to grow?
[42:01.050 --> 42:05.430]  What do you want to dedicate your time, your energy, your space, and a bunch of money to
[42:05.430 --> 42:08.870]  over the next 90 to 120 days?
[42:08.870 --> 42:11.050]  What strains have gotten your attention?
[42:11.050 --> 42:13.050]  What strains do you really enjoy smoking?
[42:13.050 --> 42:15.010]  Does something work for you medically?
[42:15.010 --> 42:17.830]  Does something work for you recreationally?
[42:17.830 --> 42:22.930]  Is there something that is reliable that every time you smoke it, you get the desired effect?
[42:22.930 --> 42:26.970]  This is going to fall back to the very first episode of this grow lesson series.
[42:26.970 --> 42:28.490]  Are you growing this for yourself?
[42:28.490 --> 42:30.570]  Are you growing it for a medical patient?
[42:30.570 --> 42:34.290]  You have a lot of things to think about when it comes to deciding what strains to grow
[42:34.290 --> 42:35.890]  in your new garden.
[42:35.890 --> 42:41.130]  In legal, medical, and recreational states, we have a lot more options for acquiring genetic
[42:41.130 --> 42:42.130]  material.
[42:42.130 --> 42:45.650]  We can go to a dispensary and buy a clone off of the shelf.
[42:45.650 --> 42:49.530]  We can go to our friend's garden and ask them for clones and they can give, sell, or trade
[42:49.530 --> 42:51.030]  those clones to us.
[42:51.130 --> 42:53.670]  We can acquire clones here very easily in Colorado.
[42:53.670 --> 42:58.510]  In fact, I went to a dispensary just a few days ago to pick up these Fuego extracts and
[42:58.510 --> 43:02.270]  they had two different variety of clones on the shelf that looked very healthy.
[43:02.270 --> 43:07.790]  They had Purple Punch and Dosey Dose on the shelf ready to go at a very reasonable price.
[43:07.790 --> 43:10.990]  Clones are readily available in Colorado.
[43:10.990 --> 43:14.110]  Seeds are also available in some Colorado dispensaries.
[43:14.110 --> 43:17.510]  You can walk right into the store, you can grab a pack of seeds, and you can start your
[43:17.510 --> 43:21.710]  new garden from seeds you picked up at your local dispensary.
[43:21.710 --> 43:25.430]  Clones and seeds are both viable options for starting a garden.
[43:25.430 --> 43:31.230]  This episode is going to focus on the great debate on seeds versus clones.
[43:31.230 --> 43:35.550]  Before we get into that, let's talk a little bit about how you can decide what strain you
[43:35.550 --> 43:36.950]  want to grow.
[43:36.950 --> 43:40.630]  The best way to do that is to smoke a bunch of different strains.
[43:40.630 --> 43:44.550]  Now, if you're in a medical or recreational state, that is a lot easier than if you were
[43:44.550 --> 43:46.350]  in Prohibition land.
[43:46.350 --> 43:50.510]  If you're in Prohibition land, who knows if the strain you are buying is even really
[43:50.510 --> 43:52.870]  what whoever is selling it to you is called.
[43:52.870 --> 43:56.750]  They're probably growing something and they're calling everything cookies because cookies
[43:56.750 --> 43:57.750]  sells.
[43:57.750 --> 44:00.190]  Anything with the letters OG at the end of it sell.
[44:00.190 --> 44:04.550]  You've probably got something cookies OG, anything with the word fire in there works
[44:04.550 --> 44:05.550]  well.
[44:05.550 --> 44:10.390]  You guys are probably buying fire cookies OG in Prohibition land everywhere.
[44:10.390 --> 44:14.910]  It's probably whatever that person got a clone of or whatever that person's buying bulk of
[44:14.910 --> 44:18.350]  and they're just renaming it because they know that names are hot.
[44:18.350 --> 44:21.070]  So in a Prohibition state, it's going to be a little bit harder.
[44:21.070 --> 44:22.070]  Maybe you'll get lucky.
[44:22.070 --> 44:24.430]  Maybe you'll get a seed in your bag of weed one day.
[44:24.430 --> 44:26.590]  You can always grow out those bag seeds.
[44:26.590 --> 44:29.910]  Sometimes you find phenotypes very close to what you started with.
[44:29.910 --> 44:33.470]  Also sometimes you find hermaphrodites and problematic plants, so be prepared for that
[44:33.470 --> 44:34.470]  as well.
[44:34.470 --> 44:36.730]  But sometimes it is your only option.
[44:36.730 --> 44:40.510]  It's always an awkward situation asking a grower for clones.
[44:40.510 --> 44:44.110]  If you're a new grower and you're buying herb from somebody and you're like, bro, I really
[44:44.110 --> 44:45.110]  love this strain.
[44:45.110 --> 44:46.390]  Do you think I could get a clone?
[44:46.390 --> 44:48.790]  That always presents an awkward situation.
[44:48.790 --> 44:50.970]  First of all, now you both know you're growing.
[44:50.970 --> 44:54.550]  If you're in a Prohibition state, that makes things really weird for both of you.
[44:54.550 --> 44:59.230]  Also the guy doesn't want to release his genetics to you because now he's going to lose a customer.
[44:59.230 --> 45:04.350]  So unless you're on a really friendly basis with your weed guy, I would avoid that conversation.
[45:04.350 --> 45:08.710]  Now in a legal state, in a recreational or a medical state, it's really easy to go find
[45:08.710 --> 45:10.790]  out what strains work best for you.
[45:10.790 --> 45:15.430]  You go to the dispensary and you buy as many grams as you can afford of different varieties
[45:15.430 --> 45:17.270]  and you go home and you smoke them.
[45:17.270 --> 45:19.990]  You start fresh every day and you try this strain.
[45:19.990 --> 45:21.310]  I haven't smoked this one yet.
[45:21.310 --> 45:25.270]  Let's smoke strain A and you take a few notes and you see how it works for you first thing
[45:25.270 --> 45:26.270]  in the morning.
[45:26.270 --> 45:29.270]  If you've got a target, if you're trying to make your leg pain go away, if you're trying
[45:29.270 --> 45:32.710]  to make your headache go away, if you're trying to make your back pain go away, if you're
[45:32.710 --> 45:38.390]  trying to make your anxiety go away, document the level of which that ailment starts.
[45:38.390 --> 45:39.390]  Is it a five?
[45:39.390 --> 45:40.390]  Is that at a 10?
[45:40.990 --> 45:43.110]  Okay, I started off with a level five leg pain.
[45:43.110 --> 45:47.790]  I smoked a bowl of this strain A. I know my leg pain is at a two.
[45:47.790 --> 45:48.790]  Document that.
[45:48.790 --> 45:50.830]  The next day I woke up, leg pain's at a five.
[45:50.830 --> 45:54.630]  I smoked strain B. Now my leg pain is still at a five.
[45:54.630 --> 45:56.790]  I obviously don't want to buy any more of this shit.
[45:56.790 --> 45:59.550]  Then you want to go the next day, day number three.
[45:59.550 --> 46:01.550]  I woke up, my leg pain's at a six.
[46:01.550 --> 46:02.550]  I smoked some of this.
[46:02.550 --> 46:03.790]  Now I'm at a two.
[46:03.790 --> 46:05.110]  This one might work well for me.
[46:05.110 --> 46:08.550]  Let's put a little star by that and remember what this is and then just keep doing little
[46:08.550 --> 46:12.830]  tests like that on yourself and with the flowers and find out what strain works for
[46:12.830 --> 46:13.830]  you.
[46:13.830 --> 46:18.030]  If you find a strain at one dispensary that works very well for you, try to find it at
[46:18.030 --> 46:22.630]  another dispensary and smoke that product because they have different growers.
[46:22.630 --> 46:24.310]  They may have different clones.
[46:24.310 --> 46:27.050]  Their product is going to come out very different in the end.
[46:27.050 --> 46:31.670]  Even if we start with the same clone, two commercial grows will produce two very different
[46:31.670 --> 46:32.670]  products.
[46:32.670 --> 46:34.410]  So try them both and see if it's the strain.
[46:34.410 --> 46:35.790]  It might've just been that one batch.
[46:35.790 --> 46:37.590]  It might've just been that one grow.
[46:37.630 --> 46:40.390]  So try different batches if possible.
[46:40.390 --> 46:43.190]  I know it sounds like I'm completely spoiled, but this is a real thing.
[46:43.190 --> 46:49.350]  I can drive to 10 dispensaries in my area and probably five of them have wedding cake
[46:49.350 --> 46:53.070]  and that wedding cake was probably grown by three different grows.
[46:53.070 --> 46:57.230]  And I bet you if I try all three of them, they're all going to have very subtle nuances.
[46:57.230 --> 46:58.830]  One will taste a little different.
[46:58.830 --> 47:01.830]  One's going to burn a little different and one's going to have a better high, but they're
[47:01.830 --> 47:06.170]  all going to have that wedding cake droopy eye giggly kind of thing going on.
[47:06.170 --> 47:09.490]  So try to check them out from different grows if you can.
[47:09.490 --> 47:13.690]  Make sure that it's the strain and not just that one grower that did it for you.
[47:13.690 --> 47:18.110]  Now one thing I want to loop back on, we talked about trying to get a clone from your grower.
[47:18.110 --> 47:23.130]  If you do try to buy a clone from your grower friend, don't be offended when he hits you
[47:23.130 --> 47:25.830]  with a really steep price.
[47:25.830 --> 47:26.830]  Think about this.
[47:26.830 --> 47:28.830]  He's been selling you herb for how long?
[47:28.830 --> 47:30.530]  And now you're going to grow your own?
[47:30.530 --> 47:32.530]  How much money are you taking out of his pocket?
[47:32.530 --> 47:36.250]  I know you're going to save that much money, but that guy has been relying on you as a
[47:36.250 --> 47:38.610]  customer and now you're going to try to grow your own?
[47:38.610 --> 47:40.690]  He's going to go, dude, this guy's gone.
[47:40.690 --> 47:44.930]  You've got to put a fat chunk in his pocket as a parting gift when he gives you that clone.
[47:44.930 --> 47:46.690]  That's why he needs so much for it.
[47:46.690 --> 47:48.690]  Also he's the only one growing that in town.
[47:48.690 --> 47:49.690]  That's how he's living.
[47:49.690 --> 47:50.690]  That's how he's making his income.
[47:50.690 --> 47:51.930]  You're going to buy it into that.
[47:51.930 --> 47:53.250]  That genetic is going to be out there.
[47:53.250 --> 47:56.870]  How does he know you're not going to run a bunch of it and flood the town with it?
[47:56.870 --> 48:00.970]  So when they hit you with a really high price for a clone in a prohibition state, that's
[48:00.970 --> 48:01.970]  why.
[48:01.970 --> 48:03.450]  That's how that person is living.
[48:03.450 --> 48:04.890]  That is his income.
[48:04.890 --> 48:05.890]  That's his artwork.
[48:05.890 --> 48:10.110]  He's probably Fino hunted that or he paid a whole lot of money for that clone himself.
[48:10.110 --> 48:15.550]  So he's sharing his revenue stream with you and kind of opening up the floodgates to put
[48:15.550 --> 48:17.430]  himself out of business.
[48:17.430 --> 48:20.810]  Once you guys do a Fino hunt and you found your own keeper, you kind of understand a
[48:20.810 --> 48:24.050]  little bit more, especially in a prohibition state.
[48:24.050 --> 48:27.930]  All right, you guys, we've talked a little bit about deciding what you want to grow.
[48:27.930 --> 48:29.690]  What you want to grow is up to you.
[48:29.690 --> 48:33.770]  Once you decide what you want to grow, if you pick something that takes 10 or 12 weeks
[48:33.770 --> 48:37.410]  and it grows tall and skinny, if that's really what you think you want to grow, you're going
[48:37.410 --> 48:39.690]  to have to adapt to that plant.
[48:39.690 --> 48:42.030]  Don't try to make that plant adapt to you.
[48:42.030 --> 48:43.450]  That is not how it works.
[48:43.450 --> 48:46.690]  All right, I've got a bunch of notes, but I don't have a good segue.
[48:46.690 --> 48:48.730]  So let's just jump right into this.
[48:48.730 --> 48:51.670]  Let's talk about the debate on seeds versus clones.
[48:51.670 --> 48:53.450]  You've decided what you want to grow.
[48:53.450 --> 48:56.770]  Now do you want to grow it from seed or from clone?
[48:56.850 --> 49:02.170]  Growing from either seed or clone both have their advantages and disadvantages.
[49:02.170 --> 49:05.450]  Something you'll have to think about with both of them is availability.
[49:05.450 --> 49:08.050]  Are clones available where you are?
[49:08.050 --> 49:13.370]  Does somebody in your area grow that is willing to release clones to you for your personal
[49:13.370 --> 49:14.410]  production?
[49:14.410 --> 49:18.130]  Is there a dispensary in your area that sells clones?
[49:18.130 --> 49:22.610]  If I read correctly, in Canada, you can ship clones to each other through the mail.
[49:22.610 --> 49:23.970]  So that's an option.
[49:23.970 --> 49:27.850]  But if nobody has clones near you, they are not available.
[49:27.850 --> 49:31.050]  Now if somebody does have clones, are they accurately labeled?
[49:31.050 --> 49:33.850]  Do they have the variety you're looking for?
[49:33.850 --> 49:35.250]  And are they clean?
[49:35.250 --> 49:37.090]  We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[49:37.090 --> 49:39.370]  It's kind of the same story with seeds.
[49:39.370 --> 49:42.690]  Do you know somebody that's got seeds that is willing to share some with you?
[49:42.690 --> 49:46.330]  And if you get them from somebody, are they accurately labeled?
[49:46.330 --> 49:49.190]  And do they have the variety that you're looking for?
[49:49.190 --> 49:53.810]  One of the advantages of seeds is that there are shops on the internet that will send seeds
[49:53.810 --> 49:56.410]  directly to your mailbox.
[49:56.410 --> 50:00.690]  If you are in a prohibition state and you order seeds from an online vendor, it is your
[50:00.690 --> 50:05.690]  responsibility to keep those seeds in the packaging and do not allow them to grow if
[50:05.690 --> 50:08.610]  it is illegal to grow them in your area.
[50:08.610 --> 50:14.810]  Save them as souvenirs and collectibles until legalization happens in your area or until
[50:14.810 --> 50:18.150]  you move to a legalized state.
[50:18.150 --> 50:22.930]  But there are several online vendors who will send you seeds to keep as collectibles.
[50:23.050 --> 50:28.450]  If you do choose to germinate those and grow those yourself, that is your responsibility.
[50:28.450 --> 50:30.930]  Anything that happens from that is up to you.
[50:30.930 --> 50:35.610]  But seeds are available online and seeds don't die in the mail.
[50:35.610 --> 50:39.750]  Now I want to do a friendly debate on clone versus seed.
[50:39.750 --> 50:44.810]  But to keep it fair, we need to act like there is a place where we can go that has clones
[50:44.810 --> 50:49.130]  and seeds available in just about any variety we could imagine.
[50:49.130 --> 50:52.690]  Think about the strain that you chose you want to grow for your first time.
[50:53.450 --> 50:57.770]  Let's imagine there's a dispensary where we can go and they've got flowers of that strain
[50:57.770 --> 51:01.970]  grown by three different growers so we can smoke it from three different people and make
[51:01.970 --> 51:03.410]  sure it's what we like.
[51:03.410 --> 51:07.650]  They've also got extracts there so if you're into smoking concentrates, they've got full
[51:07.650 --> 51:11.770]  spectrum extract, they've got shatter, they've got wax, they've got whatever you're into
[51:11.770 --> 51:15.690]  that way so you can make sure that's the strain you desire for your concentrates.
[51:15.690 --> 51:21.730]  Then also, they have got seeds and clones of your favorite strain ready for you there.
[51:21.770 --> 51:22.770]  Now you've got the option.
[51:22.770 --> 51:25.810]  Do you want to buy seeds or clones for your grow?
[51:25.810 --> 51:27.490]  Let's start a friendly debate right here.
[51:27.490 --> 51:32.170]  Now before I get too far into this, let me give a quick explanation on what a clone is.
[51:32.170 --> 51:34.090]  I'm pretty sure most people know what a seed is.
[51:34.090 --> 51:36.050]  That's a little bean that grows into a big plant.
[51:36.050 --> 51:37.410]  It came out of another plant.
[51:37.410 --> 51:38.890]  Now let's talk about a clone.
[51:38.890 --> 51:42.010]  A clone is basically a photocopy of a plant.
[51:42.010 --> 51:46.530]  We take a cutting off of a plant and it roots and now we have a photocopy of the plant we
[51:46.530 --> 51:47.930]  started with.
[51:47.930 --> 51:52.130]  Most plants are annuals, which means they only live for one year or one cycle.
[51:52.130 --> 51:56.370]  So we grow it from seed, it produces bud, we harvest it, it is over.
[51:56.370 --> 52:00.330]  By taking a clone, we can have that plant again and again.
[52:00.330 --> 52:05.330]  Then we can have repeatable, reliable outcomes and a reliable product from each harvest.
[52:05.330 --> 52:10.570]  So a clone is basically a genetic photocopy of a reliable plant in the form of just a
[52:10.570 --> 52:11.770]  tiny little plant.
[52:11.770 --> 52:15.890]  And we'll talk about clones and we'll talk about pheno hunting a lot more as these grow
[52:15.890 --> 52:17.410]  lessons go on.
[52:17.410 --> 52:21.970]  Now let's talk about some of the pros and cons of seeds and clones.
[52:21.970 --> 52:24.170]  The pros of growing from seed.
[52:24.170 --> 52:29.530]  One of the best parts about growing from seed is there are no bugs and no pathogens.
[52:29.530 --> 52:33.050]  You don't get free powdery mildew with your new clone.
[52:33.050 --> 52:37.970]  All too often, people give out clones that are infested with spider mites, with russet
[52:37.970 --> 52:42.330]  mites, with aphids, with thrips, or with powdery mildew.
[52:42.330 --> 52:45.090]  That is not an option with a seed.
[52:45.090 --> 52:49.250]  So let's also put that in the cons category when it comes to growing from clone.
[52:49.250 --> 52:54.330]  One of the disadvantages of starting from clones is that they may come with bugs or
[52:54.330 --> 52:55.850]  pathogens.
[52:55.850 --> 52:59.530]  Now let's talk about one of my favorite parts about growing from seed.
[52:59.530 --> 53:04.930]  Growing from seed allows me to find custom tailored phenotypes that work perfectly for
[53:04.930 --> 53:10.210]  what I'm looking for medically and perfectly for what I'm looking for in my grow.
[53:10.210 --> 53:12.650]  It grows the height I want it to grow.
[53:12.650 --> 53:15.050]  It grows for as long as I want it to grow.
[53:15.050 --> 53:16.410]  And it gives me medicine.
[53:16.410 --> 53:18.850]  It gives me the effect that I need.
[53:18.850 --> 53:24.610]  So growing from seed allows me to find something completely unique for myself that works perfectly
[53:24.610 --> 53:27.510]  for my garden and my medical needs.
[53:27.510 --> 53:31.530]  The con to that is it does take time for selection.
[53:31.530 --> 53:33.690]  I have to run the batch of seeds.
[53:33.690 --> 53:35.730]  I have to find the plant that works for me.
[53:35.730 --> 53:38.930]  Hopefully there was one in that batch that was exactly what I wanted.
[53:38.930 --> 53:40.370]  If not, I keep searching.
[53:40.370 --> 53:42.090]  So that is the downside to that.
[53:42.530 --> 53:47.570]  And we will do an episode on phenohunting in the future that is lined up in this series.
[53:47.570 --> 53:52.570]  So one of the advantages is that I can find perfectly custom tailored phenotypes that
[53:52.570 --> 53:54.570]  work for myself and my grow.
[53:54.570 --> 53:58.010]  The con to that is that it does take time for selection.
[53:58.010 --> 53:59.450]  I have to run the seeds.
[53:59.450 --> 54:00.610]  I have to grow them up.
[54:00.610 --> 54:01.610]  I have to cut clones.
[54:01.610 --> 54:03.250]  I have to flower them out.
[54:03.250 --> 54:06.690]  I have to dry them, cure them, smoke them, and see which ones I enjoyed, see which ones
[54:06.690 --> 54:08.130]  I didn't enjoy.
[54:08.130 --> 54:11.990]  Usually when I run a 10 pack, I find two or three that I want to run again.
[54:11.990 --> 54:15.070]  So I'll repeat the process and eliminate it to one.
[54:15.070 --> 54:19.350]  But that does take time, money, and energy to get to that point.
[54:19.350 --> 54:21.590]  Also, there may be males.
[54:21.590 --> 54:23.070]  There may be hermaphrodites.
[54:23.070 --> 54:27.110]  And there may be undesirable phenotypes in that test run.
[54:27.110 --> 54:30.810]  So depending on the quality of the seeds and the experience of the breeder and the stability
[54:30.810 --> 54:35.270]  of the work, I may not find the phenotype I'm looking for in a 10 pack.
[54:35.270 --> 54:39.390]  It may take more than 10 seeds to find the desirable phenotype.
[54:39.390 --> 54:44.270]  But if I've got reliable seeds and the breeder did his work and I've done my job properly,
[54:44.270 --> 54:47.110]  I may find something in there that is amazing.
[54:47.110 --> 54:52.110]  And I may find something in there that nobody else has, which will set me apart from the
[54:52.110 --> 54:53.110]  market.
[54:53.110 --> 54:57.350]  If I'm growing for production to put on the street, having a very unique strain would
[54:57.350 --> 54:59.230]  set me apart from the market.
[54:59.230 --> 55:02.790]  If I've got the frostiest, dankest strain on the market, people are going to want to
[55:02.790 --> 55:06.710]  buy that first, which means I'm going to make more sales, which means maybe I can charge
[55:06.710 --> 55:07.910]  a little more.
[55:07.910 --> 55:12.870]  So having that perfectly selected phenotype that grows exactly the way I want it to, it
[55:12.870 --> 55:18.610]  grows perfectly for my grow and it works perfect for my area, for my market, that is a great
[55:18.610 --> 55:21.310]  advantage of growing from seed.
[55:21.310 --> 55:25.750]  Another advantage of growing from seed is that there is a huge variety available.
[55:25.750 --> 55:29.550]  I know we talked about this imaginary store where everything is available, but it's not
[55:29.550 --> 55:31.390]  like that in all places.
[55:31.390 --> 55:36.690]  There are seed banks online that make many varieties of seeds from very many reputable
[55:36.690 --> 55:39.890]  breeders available to people all over the world.
[55:39.890 --> 55:43.130]  So seed availability is a huge advantage.
[55:43.130 --> 55:47.630]  Not everybody can get their hands on clean, reliable, accurately labeled clones.
[55:47.630 --> 55:51.850]  So being able to order seeds from a seed bank is definitely advantageous.
[55:51.850 --> 55:55.650]  Now the downside to that is seeds can be kind of expensive.
[55:55.650 --> 55:59.730]  Depending on the vendor and the breeder, seeds can have a huge markup.
[55:59.730 --> 56:04.550]  And if you're working with regular seeds, you may lose 60% of your crop right when you
[56:04.550 --> 56:08.190]  switch to flower because you're going to have male plants to deal with.
[56:08.190 --> 56:10.510]  So buying seeds can get expensive.
[56:10.510 --> 56:15.030]  And you also need to have a reliable breeder and a reputable vendor so that you know you
[56:15.030 --> 56:17.150]  are getting what you pay for.
[56:17.150 --> 56:19.670]  Now let's focus more on growing from clone.
[56:19.670 --> 56:23.110]  What are some of the advantages or pros of growing from a clone?
[56:23.110 --> 56:26.370]  If properly selected, that clone is a female.
[56:26.370 --> 56:31.430]  If properly selected, that clone is known to put out high potency and to grow without
[56:31.430 --> 56:33.050]  any issues.
[56:33.050 --> 56:36.050]  Now that being said, we have to rely on a grower.
[56:36.050 --> 56:39.130]  So that is one of the cons of growing from clones.
[56:39.130 --> 56:43.610]  Somebody has to grow the seeds and find the keeper plants out of those seed packages.
[56:43.610 --> 56:49.490]  Hopefully they chose the stellar keeper to pass on as clones to the consumers.
[56:49.490 --> 56:55.130]  In a dispensary, what usually happens is I'll cut 120 clones for my next run.
[56:55.130 --> 56:56.730]  I only need 100 of them.
[56:56.730 --> 57:00.650]  So I actually send those 20 to the store so that I don't have to throw them away.
[57:00.650 --> 57:01.730]  We put them on a manifest.
[57:01.730 --> 57:02.950]  We send them to the store.
[57:02.950 --> 57:06.470]  And those are made available for shoppers in the retail store.
[57:06.470 --> 57:11.090]  So if you're buying a clone from a dispensary and it's accurately labeled, you're probably
[57:11.090 --> 57:15.310]  getting the same exact cut as they're growing and putting on the shelf.
[57:15.310 --> 57:18.210]  So you know that those clones have been properly phenohunted.
[57:18.210 --> 57:23.230]  You know that those clones are proven females with proven potency and have proven themselves
[57:23.230 --> 57:26.190]  to be resistant to bugs and pathogens.
[57:26.190 --> 57:28.150]  So that's the advantage to growing from a clone.
[57:28.150 --> 57:31.150]  The disadvantage to that is who knows who selected that.
[57:31.150 --> 57:34.810]  If you're just getting it from some dude on Craigslist, who knows how discerning his
[57:34.810 --> 57:35.910]  eye was.
[57:35.910 --> 57:40.750]  Maybe his idea of amazing bud and your idea of amazing bud are two completely different
[57:40.750 --> 57:41.750]  things.
[57:41.750 --> 57:44.870]  So keep that in mind when working with a clone.
[57:44.870 --> 57:48.990]  Another advantage of working with a clone is we have an idea of what to expect.
[57:48.990 --> 57:51.710]  Like we said before, somebody phenohunted this clone.
[57:51.710 --> 57:53.510]  They've grown it out a couple of times.
[57:53.510 --> 57:54.910]  They know that it's a female.
[57:54.910 --> 57:59.510]  They know that it's going to have high potency, either high CBD, high THC, or a beautiful
[57:59.510 --> 58:00.950]  ratio of both.
[58:00.950 --> 58:02.070]  We know what to expect.
[58:02.070 --> 58:06.170]  We also have an idea of what type of growth patterns to expect.
[58:06.170 --> 58:07.350]  Is it going to get real tall?
[58:07.350 --> 58:08.950]  Is it going to get real bushy?
[58:08.950 --> 58:10.350]  Is it going to stretch out real bad?
[58:10.350 --> 58:12.430]  Is it going to need a lot of water?
[58:12.430 --> 58:17.430]  We also have a good idea of how long it will take to finish because our friends and partners
[58:17.430 --> 58:21.430]  have probably grown this cut several times before they gave it to us.
[58:21.430 --> 58:25.650]  So the main advantage to growing from clone is that you've got a proven female.
[58:25.650 --> 58:27.590]  You don't have to worry about calling males.
[58:27.590 --> 58:29.910]  Every plant you put in there is a female.
[58:29.910 --> 58:31.350]  They've been tested for potency.
[58:31.350 --> 58:32.630]  They've been tested for vigor.
[58:32.630 --> 58:34.550]  They've been tested for resistance.
[58:34.550 --> 58:35.870]  We know what to expect.
[58:35.870 --> 58:37.450]  We know if we need sticks.
[58:37.450 --> 58:38.650]  We know if we need trellis.
[58:38.650 --> 58:39.950]  We know how often to water it.
[58:39.950 --> 58:41.590]  We know if we can overfeed it.
[58:41.590 --> 58:46.630]  We know if it likes a high or a low pH, and we already know how many days to let it flower.
[58:46.630 --> 58:49.710]  So that is a huge advantage from working with a clone.
[58:49.710 --> 58:53.270]  Also you can always call the guy and say, hey bro, this plant's doing something weird.
[58:53.270 --> 58:55.030]  Have you ever seen this strain do this?
[58:55.030 --> 58:58.110]  And he'll say, oh yeah, man, I grew that like 10 times before I gave it to you.
[58:58.110 --> 58:59.810]  You probably just need more CalMag.
[59:00.410 --> 59:04.210]  He's got some sort of history, some sort of experience with it, and he can help you diagnose
[59:04.210 --> 59:06.410]  a problem if one does arise.
[59:06.410 --> 59:09.570]  So that's a huge advantage of working with a clone.
[59:09.570 --> 59:12.050]  Let's talk about some of the disadvantages.
[59:12.050 --> 59:16.530]  The number one disadvantage, the number one con to bringing clones into your garden is
[59:16.530 --> 59:22.010]  most of the time they are infested with bugs and pathogens.
[59:22.010 --> 59:24.770]  Every grower likes to say, my grow is immaculate.
[59:24.770 --> 59:27.410]  There is not a single bug in my garden.
[59:27.410 --> 59:29.730]  Nine times out of 10, those guys are wrong.
[59:29.730 --> 59:34.530]  The guys that boast most about having the pest free garden are the ones that don't know
[59:34.530 --> 59:35.530]  the pests are there.
[59:35.530 --> 59:38.010]  The guys that say, no, I've got a little bit of spider mites.
[59:38.010 --> 59:41.250]  They're the guys that are paying attention, that are actually checking and they know that
[59:41.250 --> 59:42.650]  those bugs are there.
[59:42.650 --> 59:43.650]  They are there.
[59:43.650 --> 59:48.490]  So getting a clone, you're probably going to get some sort of a problem.
[59:48.490 --> 59:51.530]  Everybody also likes to say, my buddy wouldn't give me clones with pests on them.
[59:51.530 --> 59:53.090]  Yeah, he doesn't even know they're there.
[59:53.090 --> 59:54.090]  He didn't check.
[59:54.090 --> 59:55.610]  He's not paying enough attention.
[59:55.610 --> 59:58.810]  He's just trying to make $5 a clone by selling them to you.
[59:58.890 --> 01:00:03.130]  He didn't care if you get spider mites or not, because you're going to need more clones
[01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:04.890]  in the future either way.
[01:00:04.890 --> 01:00:08.890]  So the downside to clones is they come with free bugs quite often.
[01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:13.410]  You get spider mites, you get free root aphids, you get free whiteflies, you get free fungus
[01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.410]  gnats.
[01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:18.730]  And if you're really lucky, sometimes you even get free powdery mildew with your new
[01:00:18.730 --> 01:00:19.730]  clones.
[01:00:19.730 --> 01:00:24.470]  Another disadvantage to growing from clone is everybody already has it.
[01:00:24.470 --> 01:00:28.090]  If you're just growing this strain for yourself, for your medical needs or for a loved one's
[01:00:28.090 --> 01:00:31.890]  medical needs, and that strain works perfectly for you, that is great.
[01:00:31.890 --> 01:00:36.830]  But if you were growing for a market reason and everybody has that strain, you're going
[01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:41.210]  to have to be a better grower than everybody else growing it to make your product stand
[01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:42.210]  out.
[01:00:42.210 --> 01:00:45.050]  Otherwise, you're just another guy selling weed on the black market.
[01:00:45.050 --> 01:00:49.330]  If you don't have a standout strain, you will blend in just like everybody else.
[01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:53.310]  So if you're growing the same clone that all of your competition is growing, you've really
[01:00:53.310 --> 01:00:55.570]  got to be the best grower.
[01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:59.370]  So that's one of the downsides to growing from clone is everybody's got it.
[01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.410]  And you guys, that's why some growers are tight with their genetics.
[01:01:02.410 --> 01:01:06.870]  That's why some guys won't let clones out because they're the only one growing that
[01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:08.650]  specific strain in that area.
[01:01:08.650 --> 01:01:11.250]  If you want that, you've got to go to them.
[01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:14.930]  They've always got some income because their product stands out.
[01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:20.090]  Now another downside to working with clones is they can get expensive.
[01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:23.770]  And something in me says that you get what you pay for when it comes to clones.
[01:01:23.770 --> 01:01:27.810]  If you're going to Craigslist and paying $3 to $5 for a clone, you're going to get
[01:01:27.810 --> 01:01:29.530]  a $3 to $5 clone.
[01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:30.890]  It may be quality genetics.
[01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:33.450]  It may be what you're looking for, but how healthy is it?
[01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.090]  How good of a start did it get?
[01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:37.130]  How many bugs does it have?
[01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:38.410]  Clones can get expensive.
[01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:43.090]  The clones that I saw at the dispensary recently were in four by four cubes of cocoa.
[01:01:43.090 --> 01:01:45.410]  The clones were about six or eight inches tall.
[01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:46.650]  They looked super healthy.
[01:01:46.650 --> 01:01:48.490]  They were $40.
[01:01:48.490 --> 01:01:52.170]  If you're trying to buy six of those, that's going to add up really quickly.
[01:01:52.170 --> 01:01:56.610]  And you throw down $240 every time you want to start a fresh grow.
[01:01:56.610 --> 01:02:00.970]  A package of seeds is way cheaper than that, but you have to do the work.
[01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:01.970]  You have to grow them.
[01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:04.290]  You have to find the males and you have to find the keeper.
[01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:08.970]  The advantage with clone is somebody has already done all of that work for you, so they can
[01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:10.850]  charge you 40 bucks.
[01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:15.810]  So one of the disadvantages to growing from clone is that they are expensive.
[01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:20.170]  Unless you're getting them from a friend, they can add up in cost quite quickly.
[01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.450]  I've seen clones go from anywhere from five or 10 bucks.
[01:02:23.450 --> 01:02:25.650]  I saw those clones at the dispensary the other day.
[01:02:25.650 --> 01:02:28.050]  They had a purple punch and a dosey dose.
[01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:30.250]  They were $40 each.
[01:02:30.250 --> 01:02:35.490]  It is not uncommon for me to see a clone sell for the 500 to $1,000 range.
[01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:41.530]  And there are stories of certain cuts being sold for 10 to $25,000, depending on what
[01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.010]  strain we're talking about.
[01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:47.010]  There are rumors of astronomical numbers, but I don't know how much of that is true.
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:51.250]  But some of the people in the bay have paid ridiculous prices for some of the OG Kushes
[01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:55.090]  and some of the more well-known strains that the rappers rap about.
[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:59.970]  Some of the OG Kush and Cookie Crosses went for big money when they first hit the market.
[01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:04.710]  And people have built entire empires and businesses off of those cuts.
[01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:07.930]  So clones can get quite expensive quite quickly.
[01:03:07.930 --> 01:03:11.250]  Another disadvantage to clones is, are they available?
[01:03:11.250 --> 01:03:13.330]  Does anybody in your area have clones?
[01:03:13.330 --> 01:03:15.650]  Does anybody you trust have clones available?
[01:03:15.650 --> 01:03:19.250]  And if you do get clones, are they accurately labeled?
[01:03:19.250 --> 01:03:21.450]  Ask your friends what clones they have.
[01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:23.650]  Don't ask for a specific strain.
[01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:27.850]  Because if you ask for wedding cake, now your friend suddenly has wedding cake and he needs
[01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.090]  big money for it.
[01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:32.490]  If you ask what strains he's got available, he'll give you a list.
[01:03:32.490 --> 01:03:33.650]  Select from there.
[01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:37.370]  Don't give them the option to invent a name or slap a label on something just because
[01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:40.890]  you're willing to throw some money their direction for that cut.
[01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:44.570]  So that is my quick debate on seed versus clone.
[01:03:44.570 --> 01:03:46.690]  We'll go over it really quickly again and recap.
[01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:50.690]  The pros of growing from seed, no bugs, no pests, no problems.
[01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:53.850]  You don't start off with somebody else's problems in your grow.
[01:03:53.850 --> 01:03:58.530]  Another advantage is that you can select perfectly selected phenotypes that work for you and
[01:03:58.530 --> 01:03:59.690]  your grow.
[01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:06.450]  Also, nobody else is going to have your phenotype, which will give you better market value.
[01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:11.090]  Some of the cons of growing from seed is that it takes time for selection.
[01:04:11.090 --> 01:04:16.530]  You have to grow them and find out what you've got, select a keeper, and then grow from there.
[01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:20.690]  You will also need to cull males and undesirable phenotypes.
[01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:23.090]  They're also a little bit expensive.
[01:04:23.090 --> 01:04:26.570]  Also is the strain you want available in seed form?
[01:04:26.570 --> 01:04:30.810]  Some of the older stuff may not be available anymore because breeders are always evolving
[01:04:30.810 --> 01:04:32.610]  and creating new stock.
[01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:36.250]  Another thing you have to think about is, are the seeds accurately labeled?
[01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.690]  Are you being sold what you're paying for?
[01:04:38.690 --> 01:04:41.030]  Now let's talk about clones really quickly again.
[01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:44.150]  The pros, you have got proven potent females.
[01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:47.670]  You know what you've got, you know what you're working with, you know what to expect, you
[01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:49.270]  know what to plan for.
[01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:53.990]  Some of the downsides to working with clones are you get those bugs, you get those pathogens,
[01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:55.590]  you get free problems.
[01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:58.070]  Also everybody else in the area has it.
[01:04:58.070 --> 01:04:59.530]  Everybody else is already growing it.
[01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:00.530]  There's nothing different.
[01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:04.710]  There's nothing exciting about it unless it's custom for you.
[01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:06.390]  Also are clones available?
[01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:07.390]  Can you even get clones?
[01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:10.470]  Do you trust the people you have to deal with to get them?
[01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:13.830]  And are they accurately labeled when you do get them?
[01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:17.870]  That is my quick, friendly, unbiased debate on seeds versus clones.
[01:05:17.870 --> 01:05:23.910]  Of course, being a breeder, I want you to buy seeds and I want you to buy them at dankseed.store.
[01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:26.910]  Then I want you to do a pheno hunt and find the one that works best for you.
[01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.190]  We will talk about pheno hunting in the future.
[01:05:29.190 --> 01:05:32.470]  We will also talk about cutting our own clones in the future.
[01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:36.630]  That way, once you've acquired clones or seeds, you can do a pheno hunt, you can select the
[01:05:36.630 --> 01:05:41.230]  keeper, then we can cut clones off of that keeper and we can be self-sustainable and
[01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:45.810]  not have to acquire genetic material from other sources unless we decide to add something
[01:05:45.810 --> 01:05:47.150]  new to the grow.
[01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:48.590]  So we'll talk about pheno hunting.
[01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:49.630]  We'll talk about cloning.
[01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:51.350]  We'll talk about mother plants.
[01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:55.670]  I have done a long episode about what to expect from a seed pack.
[01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:59.010]  I think that would make great supplemental listening to this episode.
[01:05:59.010 --> 01:06:03.550]  If you were interested in hearing my episode about seed pack expectations, it is episode
[01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.550]  245.

[01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:04.850]  I'll be back in just a couple of days with another fresh episode.
[01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.770]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, Jim Murphy.
[01:07:07.770 --> 01:07:11.290]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:15.530]  Hey, what's up, podcast world?
[01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:19.090]  It's time for episode 362 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:21.970]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:07:21.970 --> 01:07:26.330]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[01:07:26.330 --> 01:07:30.530]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:07:30.530 --> 01:07:33.530]  I like to start these shows off by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:38.770]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Orange Skittles Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:40.770]  I really like this as my morning smoke.
[01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.250]  I'm recording earlier in the morning than I usually do,
[01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:47.130]  and this Orange Skittles has that orange juice, orange candy sort of a taste.
[01:07:47.130 --> 01:07:51.410]  It's also got my head going pretty quickly, so it's a great way to start the day.
[01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:55.570]  I'm smoking the Orange Skittles Fambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.210]  The only difference between the Ambrosia and the Fambrosia
[01:07:58.210 --> 01:07:59.970]  is the Ambrosia is a one-gram jar.
[01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:03.450]  When they put it in the four-gram jar, that's when they call it the Fambrosia.
[01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:04.650]  That's for the FAM.
[01:08:04.650 --> 01:08:09.930]  So the Orange Skittles Fambrosia, the potency says 73.7% THC,
[01:08:09.930 --> 01:08:14.930]  zero CBD, total cannabinoids 84.6%.
[01:08:14.930 --> 01:08:16.170]  It's a great way to start the day.
[01:08:16.170 --> 01:08:17.530]  It's got an uplifting head high.
[01:08:17.530 --> 01:08:20.250]  It's got that amazing orange candy flavor to it,
[01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.330]  and it's got me nice and talkative and energized,
[01:08:22.330 --> 01:08:24.930]  so this should be a good podcast.
[01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:26.890]  This is going to be another grow lesson.
[01:08:26.890 --> 01:08:30.330]  In the last lesson, I talked about clones versus seeds.
[01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:33.210]  Now, in this episode, we're going to talk about regular seeds,
[01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:35.970]  feminized seeds, and auto flower seeds.
[01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:37.530]  Before we get into the seed talk,
[01:08:37.530 --> 01:08:40.930]  I want to give a few shout outs to a couple of our Patreon supporters.
[01:08:40.930 --> 01:08:43.890]  I want to give a huge shout out to Angel Burtis.
[01:08:43.890 --> 01:08:46.210]  How about a big shout out to Miles Porter,
[01:08:46.210 --> 01:08:47.970]  a super shout out to Jade,
[01:08:47.970 --> 01:08:51.770]  and an extra Viking shout out to Grimble the Druid.
[01:08:51.770 --> 01:08:54.530]  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for all the support on Patreon.
[01:08:54.530 --> 01:08:57.970]  If you're not already a patron and you would like to learn how to become a patron,

[01:09:10.330 --> 01:09:13.890]  and I will give you a shout out on the next episode.
[01:09:13.890 --> 01:09:17.810]  All right, podcast world, this episode is going to be about regular seed,
[01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:19.890]  feminized seed, and auto flower seed,
[01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:23.730]  and deciding what will be best for you and your new garden.
[01:09:23.730 --> 01:09:27.090]  A lot of people out there will have an opinion about feminized seeds.
[01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:31.170]  A lot of people out there will have an opinion about auto flower seeds.
[01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:34.890]  Don't let anybody stop you from growing what makes you happy.
[01:09:34.890 --> 01:09:37.330]  There's a reason why regular seeds exist.
[01:09:37.330 --> 01:09:39.610]  There's a reason why feminized seeds exist.
[01:09:39.610 --> 01:09:42.970]  There is a reason why auto flower seeds exist.
[01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:46.490]  There are applications for all of those types of seeds.
[01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:48.930]  Do what you love and don't let anybody out there
[01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:51.690]  stop you from growing from your heart.
[01:09:51.690 --> 01:09:55.530]  When we are shopping for seeds, we are thrown a lot of information.
[01:09:55.530 --> 01:09:59.770]  Some of it is very useful, some of it is just fluff for advertising.
[01:09:59.770 --> 01:10:02.890]  Somewhere in that information, we should be able to tell
[01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:08.490]  if the seeds we are shopping for are regular, feminized, or auto flowering.
[01:10:08.490 --> 01:10:11.490]  That should be clearly noted somewhere in the description.
[01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:16.570]  If I don't see any sort of notation, I generally assume they are regular seeds.
[01:10:16.570 --> 01:10:17.970]  Now, that's a really good place to start.
[01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:19.850]  What do I mean by regular seed?
[01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:23.210]  By regular seed, I mean they were produced conventionally.
[01:10:23.210 --> 01:10:26.130]  They were made with a male plant and a female plant.
[01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:29.930]  In that package of seeds, you will find males and females.
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:34.530]  They are also not auto flower, which means they are photo period.
[01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:37.130]  Now, let's talk briefly about photo period.
[01:10:37.130 --> 01:10:41.290]  Photo period means that a plant is triggered into its flowering stage
[01:10:41.290 --> 01:10:43.170]  by a light cycle.
[01:10:43.170 --> 01:10:48.010]  In nature, this light cycle is mostly dictated by your location
[01:10:48.010 --> 01:10:50.250]  in relation to the equator.
[01:10:50.250 --> 01:10:51.890]  Are you right on the equator?
[01:10:51.890 --> 01:10:54.850]  Are you far north or are you far south of the equator?
[01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:57.890]  Now, as the seasons change, as fall rolls around,
[01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:03.530]  regions on the equator will start experiencing longer nights and shorter days.
[01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:06.410]  Those longer nights and shorter days tell our plant,
[01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:09.690]  hey, winter is coming, you need to start producing your flowers
[01:11:09.690 --> 01:11:12.290]  so that you can reproduce before the end of the season.
[01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:16.370]  And that triggers the plant to go into flowering, that is its photo period.
[01:11:16.370 --> 01:11:23.010]  Indoors, most cannabis plants require about a 12-hour dark period to induce flower.
[01:11:23.010 --> 01:11:26.410]  Outdoors can be different because the sun puts off different spectrums
[01:11:26.410 --> 01:11:27.730]  that trigger the plants to go to sleep.
[01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:30.450]  As the sun sets, it puts off a red spectrum that tells that plant,
[01:11:30.450 --> 01:11:32.490]  hey, it's nighttime, and then it starts going to sleep.
[01:11:32.490 --> 01:11:35.210]  As the sun rises, it puts off a blue spectrum that tells the plant
[01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:36.290]  it's time to wake up.
[01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:38.770]  So you don't need the 12-12 outdoors.
[01:11:38.770 --> 01:11:43.650]  You can work closer to a 14-hour day and more of a 10-hour night outdoors
[01:11:43.650 --> 01:11:45.850]  because the sun tells the plants to go to sleep.
[01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:47.290]  But that is photo period.
[01:11:47.290 --> 01:11:51.890]  The plants work off the light cycle, and the light cycle works with nature outdoors.
[01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:54.450]  Indoors, we're controlling that with a timer.
[01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:56.410]  So that is basically photo period.
[01:11:56.410 --> 01:12:00.690]  If your seeds are marked regular seeds or if it says photo on the package,
[01:12:00.690 --> 01:12:03.730]  that indicates that those plants will be triggered to flower
[01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:08.290]  by reducing your light schedule to 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[01:12:08.290 --> 01:12:12.250]  Now, regular seeds also indicates that there will be males and females
[01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:13.930]  in that package of seeds.
[01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.850]  If you're trying to grow a seedless crop, you will have to pay attention
[01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:19.330]  and keep the males out of the flowering room.
[01:12:19.330 --> 01:12:22.930]  Somewhere between 7 and 10 days, those plants will start showing their sex.
[01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:25.330]  You'll have to go through and pull out all of the males.
[01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:29.290]  If you leave one male plant in there for too long, it will pollinate,
[01:12:29.290 --> 01:12:32.130]  and all of the plants around it will be seeded.
[01:12:32.130 --> 01:12:36.170]  And depending on how long you let that male go and how much pollen he released
[01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:39.250]  and how much wind flow and how much movement you have in that grow,
[01:12:39.250 --> 01:12:43.050]  you may seed the entire crop with just one male.
[01:12:43.050 --> 01:12:45.090]  So that is basically regular seed.
[01:12:45.090 --> 01:12:46.010]  They are regular seed.
[01:12:46.010 --> 01:12:50.410]  They were bred conventionally, traditionally, with a male and a female plant.
[01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:53.410]  They are photosensitive, which means they will trigger into flower
[01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:57.770]  by reducing the lights to approximately 12 hours on and 12 hours off.
[01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:59.970]  Some plants will work one hour either direction.
[01:12:59.970 --> 01:13:04.010]  You could go 13 hours on, you could go 13 hours off, you could play with that.
[01:13:04.010 --> 01:13:07.370]  But we recommend 12-12 as the critical period.
[01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:12.050]  Also, you will find males and females in your regular seeds.
[01:13:12.050 --> 01:13:15.570]  If you're not looking to do any breeding, if you want to grow seedless cannabis,
[01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:17.810]  you do need to cull those males.
[01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:21.450]  So that's the only major downfall of regular seeds.
[01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.370]  When you buy a package of regular seeds,
[01:13:23.370 --> 01:13:26.970]  you've got about a 50-50 chance of getting males and females.
[01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:30.250]  It's hard to dictate what you get with regular seeds.
[01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:34.250]  Now, a lot of people don't want to waste the energy, the time, the space, or the money
[01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:37.450]  buying and growing seeds that could possibly be males
[01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:39.210]  and need to be removed from the garden.
[01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:42.690]  Now, that is where feminized seeds come into play.
[01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:46.530]  A lot of people have hatred toward feminized seeds because they are misinformed.
[01:13:46.530 --> 01:13:50.610]  A lot of people have hatred or a bias against feminized seeds
[01:13:50.610 --> 01:13:53.330]  because there were a few breeders back in the day
[01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:56.250]  that put out a batch of feminized seeds that were total shit,
[01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:58.970]  and a few people bought those, and it put a bad taste in their mouth,
[01:13:58.970 --> 01:14:01.770]  and those people spread that taste throughout the internet.
[01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:03.930]  And I understand when you get a terrible product,
[01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:06.930]  you want to tell people, people believe you, I get that.
[01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:08.770]  But that was way back in the day.
[01:14:08.770 --> 01:14:10.490]  We have come a long way since then.
[01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:14.330]  We understand how to produce feminized seeds on a commercial scale,
[01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:17.090]  and there are a lot of breeders and producers out there
[01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:20.850]  putting out reliable, quality feminized seeds.
[01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:25.090]  When they are made properly, feminized seeds will produce plants
[01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:28.730]  that give you 99.9% females.
[01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:33.210]  This is nature and science together, so there will be anomalies.
[01:14:33.210 --> 01:14:36.850]  You will find things that don't fall into the chart that we drew
[01:14:36.850 --> 01:14:38.370]  because that's how nature works.
[01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:41.290]  That's why we say 99.9%.
[01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:45.010]  If I do my job correctly when I produce feminized seeds,
[01:14:45.010 --> 01:14:49.050]  you will get 99.9% female plants.
[01:14:49.050 --> 01:14:52.650]  I'll give you a brief explanation on how I make feminized seeds
[01:14:52.650 --> 01:14:57.730]  and how a lot of the leading feminized seed producers make their products.
[01:14:57.730 --> 01:15:00.930]  I create a solution of silver thiosulfate
[01:15:00.930 --> 01:15:02.610]  that is really easy to learn how to do.
[01:15:02.610 --> 01:15:05.610]  All of the instructions for that are readily available on the internet.
[01:15:05.650 --> 01:15:08.210]  You can make a silver thiosulfate solution
[01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:12.330]  from products that are easily attainable on the internet for less than $30.
[01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:13.650]  Get these products.
[01:15:13.650 --> 01:15:15.890]  I use product number one and product number two.
[01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:19.050]  I mix them into water, then I mix the two things of water together.
[01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:22.210]  Now I've got my silver thiosulfate concentration.
[01:15:22.210 --> 01:15:23.570]  I dilute that.
[01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:28.610]  Each plant that I'm using requires a different dilution and application rate.
[01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:30.690]  There is a standard that I start with.
[01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:33.130]  The basic dilution that I recommend to start with
[01:15:33.170 --> 01:15:37.930]  would be a one to nine ratio of silver thiosulfate to water.
[01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:39.690]  You've got nine parts water,
[01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:43.570]  one part of the silver thiosulfate concentrate mixed into there.
[01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:48.010]  Shake that up real well and apply that to the plant on the first day of flower,
[01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:51.170]  and then apply it every three days for 21 days.
[01:15:51.170 --> 01:15:54.050]  You're going to give the plant seven full applications
[01:15:54.050 --> 01:15:57.450]  and spray it until it drips and get the stalks.
[01:15:57.450 --> 01:15:58.810]  Don't just get the leaves.
[01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:00.610]  Get in there and spray the stalks.
[01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:03.610]  Be careful when you're using the silver thiosulfate spray
[01:16:03.610 --> 01:16:05.930]  because it may turn some things purple.
[01:16:05.930 --> 01:16:08.810]  If you've got a white wall, depending on what you're up against,
[01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:12.050]  whatever that hits, it could turn it purple, including your skin.
[01:16:12.050 --> 01:16:15.730]  Be careful. Wear gloves. Wear a mask when working with the silver thiosulfate solution.
[01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.050]  That is always my recommendation.
[01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:21.170]  I take the silver thiosulfate solution that I have created.
[01:16:21.170 --> 01:16:22.330]  Then I apply it.
[01:16:22.330 --> 01:16:24.730]  I mix it at a dilution of nine to one,
[01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:29.450]  nine parts distilled water, one part silver thiosulfate concentrate.
[01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:32.290]  Then I apply it to the plants every three days for 21 days.
[01:16:32.290 --> 01:16:34.210]  It gets 21 applications.
[01:16:34.210 --> 01:16:39.450]  Then usually around day 25 to 30, it starts putting out pollen.
[01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:41.010]  That's when I start collecting the pollen.
[01:16:41.010 --> 01:16:42.970]  I put something, usually a piece of glass,
[01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:44.690]  just depends on where I am and what I'm working with.
[01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:48.170]  I put a piece of glass near the plant, collect some pollen as it naturally falls out,
[01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:51.130]  pick the male flowers out of there, gather that, let it dry.
[01:16:51.130 --> 01:16:52.890]  Then when it really starts getting dumping,
[01:16:52.890 --> 01:16:55.610]  that's when I'll move it right over by the girls and give it a good shake.
[01:16:55.610 --> 01:16:57.970]  And now we've just made feminized seeds.
[01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:01.650]  I've still got six or seven weeks of nourishing those seeds.
[01:17:01.650 --> 01:17:04.930]  But if I've done everything carefully and done everything correctly,
[01:17:04.930 --> 01:17:07.250]  I have created feminized seeds.
[01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:10.450]  And there should be no reason why those should be problematic
[01:17:10.450 --> 01:17:13.210]  unless I completely screw up the next six or seven weeks,
[01:17:13.210 --> 01:17:17.010]  which is very unlikely because all I've got to do is make sure the equipment functions,
[01:17:17.010 --> 01:17:19.330]  make sure everything stays on a 12-12 cycle.
[01:17:19.330 --> 01:17:20.530]  I've got to feed it properly.
[01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:22.130]  I know how to feed plants that are pregnant.
[01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:23.930]  I know how to produce quality seeds.
[01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.410]  I've got to defoliate properly.
[01:17:25.410 --> 01:17:29.250]  And I've also got to make sure to keep everything pest and problem-free.
[01:17:29.250 --> 01:17:31.170]  And I'm quite experienced at all of that so far.
[01:17:31.170 --> 01:17:32.770]  So there should be no problem.
[01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:36.410]  I also make sure to thoroughly test run every batch of seeds I make
[01:17:36.410 --> 01:17:38.050]  before they make it to market.
[01:17:38.050 --> 01:17:39.450]  I grow some out myself.
[01:17:39.450 --> 01:17:40.890]  I give a bunch out to my friends.
[01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:43.210]  I'm sure you guys see on Instagram, people have the new stuff.
[01:17:43.210 --> 01:17:44.530]  You're like, how did they get that?
[01:17:44.530 --> 01:17:46.490]  It's because they grew something of mine.
[01:17:46.490 --> 01:17:47.410]  I was impressed by it.
[01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:50.370]  I reached out to them and I said, hey, do you want to run my next batch?
[01:17:50.370 --> 01:17:53.810]  I need you to take good notes, take good photos, send it all back to me.
[01:17:53.810 --> 01:17:56.050]  And then I'll know if I want to release that line or not.
[01:17:56.050 --> 01:17:57.450]  So I have other people grow it.
[01:17:57.450 --> 01:17:58.410]  I grow it myself.
[01:17:58.410 --> 01:18:00.570]  We test it before it's put out to market.
[01:18:00.570 --> 01:18:03.890]  That way I know that you're receiving a quality product.
[01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:07.010]  I'm going to go off way on a side rant here that's not even written down.
[01:18:07.010 --> 01:18:10.170]  When I make a new strain, so let's just say I just pulled some seeds out
[01:18:10.170 --> 01:18:11.970]  of a plant last night.
[01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:13.010]  That's a brand new cross.
[01:18:13.010 --> 01:18:13.930]  Nobody's ever seen it.
[01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:14.650]  I've never seen it.
[01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:16.170]  I don't know what it's going to do.
[01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:19.610]  Before those seeds go anywhere, I'm going to throw a handful of them
[01:18:19.610 --> 01:18:21.890]  in a paper towel and germinate them.
[01:18:21.890 --> 01:18:25.330]  And then in 24 hours, I'm going to pop it open and I'm going to see how many
[01:18:25.330 --> 01:18:26.330]  have sprouted tails.
[01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:29.170]  And I'm going to make a note and I'm going to write down the ratio.
[01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:33.410]  However, out of 100, they sprouted tails or they did not sprout tails.
[01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:36.370]  Then I'll close it back up and I'll let the other ones keep going.
[01:18:36.370 --> 01:18:40.050]  And I'll see in 36 hours how many made tails and I'll take good notes.
[01:18:40.050 --> 01:18:43.250]  Then I'll put some of those, the ones that did sprout tails and look good,
[01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:45.250]  I'm going to put those into some cups of dirt.
[01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.210]  And I'm going to grow them.
[01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:47.610]  And I'm going to pay attention to them.
[01:18:47.610 --> 01:18:48.810]  And I'm going to keep a lot of notes.
[01:18:48.810 --> 01:18:49.610]  I'm going to veg them.
[01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:50.650]  I'm going to flower them.
[01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:51.690]  I'm going to grow them.
[01:18:51.690 --> 01:18:55.290]  I'm going to dry them, cure them, smoke them, make concentrates out of them,
[01:18:55.290 --> 01:18:56.930]  smoke the concentrates.
[01:18:56.930 --> 01:19:01.930]  We're at least 120 days from even knowing what that product tastes like,
[01:19:01.930 --> 01:19:05.650]  probably closer to 150 with the dry and cure phase in there.
[01:19:05.650 --> 01:19:07.850]  Then that is my first grow with it.
[01:19:07.850 --> 01:19:10.850]  If I approve, then I'll pass some seeds on to Grim.
[01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:13.450]  If Grimble grows it and it looks good in his garden,
[01:19:13.450 --> 01:19:15.490]  I'll spread it out to a few more people.
[01:19:15.490 --> 01:19:20.290]  If they grow it well, that's when I'll let it go to a vendor or for retail.
[01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:23.290]  But I test the shit out of my feminized seeds and my regular seeds.
[01:19:23.290 --> 01:19:24.970]  So I stand behind my product.
[01:19:24.970 --> 01:19:28.850]  And honestly, every feminized seed that I produce sells.
[01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:31.130]  I can't keep feminized seeds in stock.
[01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:34.650]  And I don't get any complaints on my feminized seed products.
[01:19:34.650 --> 01:19:35.770]  So that's how Femmes are made.
[01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:37.450]  That's how I make my Femmes.
[01:19:37.450 --> 01:19:42.050]  The advantage to feminized seeds is there are no males to remove from the garden.
[01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:45.770]  You know that every seed you plant will result in a harvested crop.
[01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:47.770]  You won't have to grow it long enough to sex it.
[01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:49.410]  You won't be wasting any time.
[01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:52.410]  That's advantageous for people who live in medical states
[01:19:52.410 --> 01:19:55.450]  or anybody who is limited by a plant count.
[01:19:55.450 --> 01:19:59.130]  So your feminized seeds are all going to be females.
[01:19:59.130 --> 01:20:01.770]  Now you would say, why would people grow photo period seeds
[01:20:01.770 --> 01:20:05.170]  when they can grow feminized seeds and guarantee that everything they grow
[01:20:05.170 --> 01:20:06.850]  makes it to harvest?
[01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:11.170]  Like I said, a lot of people have a bias against feminized seeds.
[01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:15.730]  Also, a lot of people like myself like finding the males.
[01:20:15.730 --> 01:20:19.010]  Breeding with females and reversed females and alpha females
[01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:22.970]  is a great practice, but I like working with a solid male plant.
[01:20:22.970 --> 01:20:24.970]  I've got a passion for conventional breeding.
[01:20:24.970 --> 01:20:29.330]  I do make feminized seeds, but I have more fun with conventional breeding.
[01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:31.810]  Another thing you may notice when you're shopping for seeds
[01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:35.650]  is that feminized seeds are about twice the price of regular seeds.
[01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:39.170]  So yes, you do get viable females that you can take to harvest,
[01:20:39.170 --> 01:20:42.130]  but that pack of seeds cost exactly twice
[01:20:42.130 --> 01:20:43.810]  as what a regular pack of seeds cost.
[01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:47.090]  Although you didn't have to waste the time, the space, the soil, the energy,
[01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:49.250]  and you didn't have to have that extra plant count
[01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:51.530]  to add to your numbers in your legal garden.
[01:20:51.530 --> 01:20:54.090]  So if the packaging says feminized seeds,
[01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:58.650]  that means that 99.9% of the plants that come out of that seed package
[01:20:58.650 --> 01:21:00.290]  will be females.
[01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:02.330]  Now here's something that is kind of a side rant
[01:21:02.330 --> 01:21:04.650]  that I was talking to somebody on social media about
[01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:06.330]  that I want to include in a podcast.
[01:21:06.330 --> 01:21:08.810]  I'm just going to give it a couple of seconds.
[01:21:08.810 --> 01:21:09.930]  We talk about the flip.
[01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:15.010]  When we flip to flower, feminized and regular photo period seeds,
[01:21:15.010 --> 01:21:17.370]  we flip them to flower by changing the light cycle
[01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:21.370]  either from 24 on and zero off to 18 on and six off,
[01:21:21.370 --> 01:21:23.530]  or however you've got your light cycle set up.
[01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:25.450]  Then you switch to 12 on and 12 off.
[01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:26.970]  You are now in flower.
[01:21:26.970 --> 01:21:29.050]  Or if you're going to follow the DJ Short Plan,
[01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:30.930]  you go 11 on, 13 off.
[01:21:30.930 --> 01:21:32.650]  That's a whole nother podcast.
[01:21:32.650 --> 01:21:35.450]  Anyway, we flip to flower.
[01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:37.410]  That is day one of flower.
[01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:39.370]  Your seed package will give you an estimate
[01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:40.890]  of how long they need to flower,
[01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:44.770]  nine to 10 weeks, 60 to 70 days, whatever it says.
[01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:48.130]  The day you initiated that flip is day one.
[01:21:48.130 --> 01:21:51.410]  Not the day you see bud set, not the day you smell something,
[01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:54.850]  not the day the butterflies flew in and did their magic dance.
[01:21:54.850 --> 01:21:57.770]  The day you change that timer is day one of flower.
[01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:59.410]  That's how you keep track of that.
[01:21:59.410 --> 01:22:01.090]  That's what we're talking about
[01:22:01.090 --> 01:22:04.090]  when we indicated that on the seed package.
[01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:05.650]  Just wanted to add that side note.
[01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:07.370]  I'm not sure if that was even relevant,
[01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:10.410]  but there you go, a little bonus nugget for your brain.
[01:22:10.410 --> 01:22:12.770]  All right, now let's work into auto-flowering seeds.
[01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:14.130]  Let's talk about auto-flowers.
[01:22:14.170 --> 01:22:16.450]  What do I mean by an auto-flowering seed?
[01:22:16.450 --> 01:22:19.130]  Earlier, I was talking about your location
[01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:21.490]  in relation to the equator.
[01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:24.250]  Most of us live in an area where we see seasonal changes,
[01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:27.010]  and we also see changes in day and nighttime.
[01:22:27.010 --> 01:22:30.130]  But keep in mind, there are parts of Russia and Alaska
[01:22:30.130 --> 01:22:33.090]  that will receive extreme stretches of daylight
[01:22:33.090 --> 01:22:35.610]  and nighttime without interruption.
[01:22:35.610 --> 01:22:37.290]  There are some points in Alaska
[01:22:37.290 --> 01:22:41.490]  when they will have full sunlight for 80 days in a row.
[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:45.970]  They will not get a night for 80 solid days.
[01:22:45.970 --> 01:22:49.410]  Cannabis is an extraordinary plant, and it has evolved.
[01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:51.330]  The cannabis that we're familiar with,
[01:22:51.330 --> 01:22:54.050]  which has evolved from these extreme conditions
[01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:57.210]  with no dark, is known as ruderalis.
[01:22:57.210 --> 01:22:59.530]  These ruderalis plants have evolved
[01:22:59.530 --> 01:23:02.290]  to flower without any dark period.
[01:23:02.290 --> 01:23:03.810]  After so many generations, they went,
[01:23:03.810 --> 01:23:05.370]  hey, it doesn't get dark.
[01:23:05.370 --> 01:23:07.250]  We need to do something about this.
[01:23:07.250 --> 01:23:08.490]  So through evolution,
[01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:11.930]  they started to flower without a dark period.
[01:23:11.930 --> 01:23:13.690]  A lot of those ruderalis plants
[01:23:13.690 --> 01:23:16.250]  have no desirable effect when smoked,
[01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:20.050]  but they have a lot of desirable traits when grown.
[01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:22.130]  Some of them stay short, they stay squat,
[01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:23.690]  they push out really nicely,
[01:23:23.690 --> 01:23:26.130]  and you don't have to change the light cycle
[01:23:26.130 --> 01:23:28.770]  to convince them to flower for you.
[01:23:28.770 --> 01:23:32.250]  So cannabis breeders got ahold of ruderalis plants,
[01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:33.970]  and they bred them together.
[01:23:33.970 --> 01:23:36.330]  They bred our auto-flowering ruderalis
[01:23:36.330 --> 01:23:38.730]  to our high-potency cannabis plants,
[01:23:38.730 --> 01:23:40.090]  and the offspring resulted
[01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:44.010]  in high-potency auto-flowering cannabis plants.
[01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:46.010]  Most of the auto-flowering seeds available
[01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:48.450]  for most breeders now are feminized.
[01:23:48.450 --> 01:23:51.370]  So you'll get auto-flowering seeds that are all girls,
[01:23:51.370 --> 01:23:52.770]  which is really advantageous,
[01:23:52.770 --> 01:23:54.570]  and we'll talk about that in just a minute.
[01:23:54.570 --> 01:23:56.730]  I should warn you that when you're looking at seeds
[01:23:56.730 --> 01:23:58.570]  and you see feminized seeds on there,
[01:23:58.570 --> 01:24:01.530]  also look to see if they say photo period
[01:24:01.530 --> 01:24:02.570]  or auto-flower on there.
[01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:04.010]  Make sure they indicate that.
[01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:06.370]  If they don't, they are probably photo period.
[01:24:06.370 --> 01:24:08.970]  All of the auto-flower guys like to let you know
[01:24:08.970 --> 01:24:10.330]  that you're working with auto-flowers.
[01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:12.690]  They clearly indicate that on the package.
[01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.890]  And earlier I mentioned that feminized seeds
[01:24:14.890 --> 01:24:16.810]  cost twice as much as regular.
[01:24:16.810 --> 01:24:20.650]  Auto-flowers generally cost twice as much as feminized.
[01:24:20.650 --> 01:24:23.050]  So you got your regular, then they're doubled,
[01:24:23.050 --> 01:24:24.570]  then they're even doubled again.
[01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:26.770]  So they will let you know if they're auto-flowers.
[01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:28.330]  Just make sure you read the package
[01:24:28.330 --> 01:24:29.250]  when you're buying your seed.
[01:24:29.250 --> 01:24:32.730]  It'll either say regular or feminized or auto-flower.
[01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:34.770]  Just do a little research before you buy your seeds.
[01:24:34.770 --> 01:24:36.050]  Make sure you know what you're getting.
[01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:38.370]  Now, let's talk a little bit about
[01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:41.850]  how these auto-flower seeds are useful.
[01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:43.770]  If you've been listening to the show for a while,
[01:24:43.770 --> 01:24:47.370]  you love my favorite example of these auto-flowers in use.
[01:24:47.370 --> 01:24:49.730]  Several years ago, there was a very large grow
[01:24:49.730 --> 01:24:53.250]  discovered in a national forest not too far from here.
[01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:57.090]  And it was discovered that that grow was ran by a cartel.
[01:24:57.090 --> 01:24:59.210]  As the reports and pictures came out,
[01:24:59.210 --> 01:25:00.650]  they were saying that the cartel
[01:25:00.650 --> 01:25:03.250]  had three different stages of growth happening
[01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:04.970]  in their illegal grow area.
[01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:06.410]  Now, that really made me wonder,
[01:25:06.410 --> 01:25:08.970]  how are they growing different stages outdoors
[01:25:08.970 --> 01:25:11.290]  because the sun dictates what our plants do.
[01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:12.330]  If they put them outside,
[01:25:12.330 --> 01:25:14.050]  they all went into flower at the same time.
[01:25:14.050 --> 01:25:16.850]  Then my brain went, dude, they're using auto-flowers.
[01:25:16.850 --> 01:25:21.090]  So this large cartel would set a patch of auto-flower plants.
[01:25:21.090 --> 01:25:22.290]  Then they would wait a few weeks
[01:25:22.290 --> 01:25:25.250]  and they would set another large patch of auto-flower plants,
[01:25:25.250 --> 01:25:26.210]  wait a few weeks,
[01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:28.810]  and set another large patch of auto-flower plants
[01:25:28.850 --> 01:25:31.530]  to where eventually they had a perpetual cycle going
[01:25:31.530 --> 01:25:33.050]  to where they had people out there
[01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:36.570]  in this national forest camouflaged, hidden,
[01:25:36.570 --> 01:25:38.250]  growing a perpetual grow,
[01:25:38.250 --> 01:25:40.290]  packaging up and sending it to who knows where,
[01:25:40.290 --> 01:25:41.810]  I have no idea where it was going,
[01:25:41.810 --> 01:25:44.210]  but they were producing quite a bit of cannabis out there
[01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:45.490]  by using auto-flowers.
[01:25:45.490 --> 01:25:48.290]  They had a perpetual grow under the natural sun.
[01:25:48.290 --> 01:25:50.210]  They didn't have to veg and then flower.
[01:25:50.210 --> 01:25:51.810]  They could just throw the seeds out there.
[01:25:51.810 --> 01:25:53.410]  They would grow and do their thing.
[01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:56.290]  So that's one way where auto-flower seeds
[01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:57.650]  were highly effective.
[01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:59.450]  Now let's scale that down a little bit.
[01:25:59.450 --> 01:26:01.730]  Let's say you've only got one grow space
[01:26:01.730 --> 01:26:04.410]  and you want to produce a perpetual grow.
[01:26:04.410 --> 01:26:05.610]  You don't have a veg room.
[01:26:05.610 --> 01:26:07.050]  You don't have a flower room.
[01:26:07.050 --> 01:26:09.210]  You can't go buy clones from a friend.
[01:26:09.210 --> 01:26:11.050]  You can't have a friend veg for you.
[01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:12.370]  The way you could run a small,
[01:26:12.370 --> 01:26:14.530]  self-sustainable perpetual grow
[01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:17.250]  is with auto-flower plants in one room.
[01:26:17.250 --> 01:26:19.850]  Fill up a quarter or half of the room with auto-flowers.
[01:26:19.850 --> 01:26:21.410]  As soon as they start flowering,
[01:26:21.410 --> 01:26:23.930]  plant more auto-flowers and put them in the same room.
[01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:26.050]  You'll have veg plants and flowering plants
[01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:27.370]  in the same room.
[01:26:27.370 --> 01:26:29.930]  You can't do that with photo-period plants.
[01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:31.170]  So if you're limited on space,
[01:26:31.170 --> 01:26:32.730]  if you've only got one room,
[01:26:32.730 --> 01:26:34.370]  that's a really useful method
[01:26:34.370 --> 01:26:38.770]  and a really useful application for auto-flowering plants.
[01:26:38.770 --> 01:26:41.410]  The major downside that I see to auto-flowering plants
[01:26:41.410 --> 01:26:43.530]  is you always have to buy new seeds.
[01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:46.090]  You cannot clone an auto-flowering plant.
[01:26:46.090 --> 01:26:47.290]  If you're growing with regular
[01:26:47.290 --> 01:26:49.610]  or feminized photo-period seeds,
[01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:51.090]  you're always able to cut a clone.
[01:26:51.090 --> 01:26:52.450]  You can keep that clone as a mother.
[01:26:52.450 --> 01:26:53.930]  You can keep it perpetually,
[01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:56.170]  and then you can always clone off of that mother,
[01:26:56.170 --> 01:26:58.290]  and you can keep that plant sustainable.
[01:26:58.290 --> 01:26:59.370]  With auto-flowers,
[01:26:59.370 --> 01:27:01.890]  you're always going to be buying new seeds.
[01:27:01.890 --> 01:27:02.930]  And earlier I mentioned,
[01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:04.450]  most of the auto-flower companies
[01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:06.090]  are only putting out feminized,
[01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:09.090]  so you're not even able to breed your own auto-flowers
[01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.730]  with males and females anymore.
[01:27:10.730 --> 01:27:12.130]  You're going to have to reverse one,
[01:27:12.130 --> 01:27:14.570]  and I have no experience doing that.
[01:27:14.570 --> 01:27:15.410]  All right, you guys,
[01:27:15.410 --> 01:27:17.250]  that is my breakdown on regular seeds,
[01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:20.690]  feminized seeds, and auto-flowering seeds.
[01:27:20.690 --> 01:27:22.930]  The regular seeds are always photo-period.
[01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:25.370]  I like them because we find males and females.
[01:27:25.370 --> 01:27:27.130]  I like breeding with the regular seeds.
[01:27:27.130 --> 01:27:28.610]  That's a lot of fun for me.
[01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.370]  The feminized seeds can be photo-period,
[01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:32.770]  or they can be auto-flower.
[01:27:32.770 --> 01:27:35.290]  They are probably well-marked on the packaging.
[01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:37.090]  Those are always going to be females
[01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:38.970]  if they were bred properly.
[01:27:38.970 --> 01:27:40.770]  I've done a whole nother podcast episode
[01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:44.690]  about marking feminized seeds with S or R1 generations.
[01:27:44.690 --> 01:27:46.610]  I encourage you to listen to that one.
[01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:48.410]  That one is episode 331,
[01:27:48.410 --> 01:27:50.450]  and it's titled Selfing and Reversals.
[01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:52.610]  You'll learn a lot about why we label the packages
[01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:53.690]  the way we do.
[01:27:53.690 --> 01:27:55.930]  Also, I recommend you listen to an episode
[01:27:55.930 --> 01:27:58.050]  called Seed Pack Expectations,
[01:27:58.050 --> 01:28:00.050]  and that is number 245.
[01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:02.130]  There's a lot of useful information in that episode
[01:28:02.130 --> 01:28:04.890]  for anyone who is considering purchasing new seeds.
[01:28:04.890 --> 01:28:05.730]  Then we'll keep it moving.
[01:28:05.730 --> 01:28:07.810]  We talked about auto-flowering seeds.
[01:28:07.810 --> 01:28:10.570]  Auto-flowering plants are unique to photo-period plants
[01:28:10.570 --> 01:28:13.450]  because they flower based on their size or their age.
[01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:15.130]  We can put them under the veg lights.
[01:28:15.130 --> 01:28:17.010]  We can have them in the 18.6 room,
[01:28:17.010 --> 01:28:18.250]  and they will still flower,
[01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:20.250]  and they will still produce buds.
[01:28:20.250 --> 01:28:21.970]  A lot of auto-flowering plants boast
[01:28:21.970 --> 01:28:24.970]  that they will be completely done around 10 weeks,
[01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:27.330]  so that's 70 days of a full cycle.
[01:28:27.330 --> 01:28:28.690]  With a photo-period plant,
[01:28:28.690 --> 01:28:33.210]  you've got closer to 120 days if you want usable product.
[01:28:33.210 --> 01:28:34.970]  So that is my lesson on regular,
[01:28:34.970 --> 01:28:37.690]  feminized, and auto-flowering seeds.
[01:28:37.690 --> 01:28:39.250]  I hope I made your decision easier
[01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:40.930]  when it comes time to go shopping.
[01:28:40.930 --> 01:28:42.690]  Don't be afraid to try regular seeds.
[01:28:42.690 --> 01:28:44.610]  Don't be afraid to try feminized seeds,
[01:28:44.610 --> 01:28:46.770]  and don't be afraid to try auto-flower seeds.
[01:28:46.770 --> 01:28:48.610]  You just may fall in love with something
[01:28:48.610 --> 01:28:50.450]  you never thought you would even like.
[01:28:50.450 --> 01:28:54.770]  And don't forget, you can find your seeds at dankseed.store.
[01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:56.810]  We're working on a Black Friday sale, you guys.
[01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:58.730]  This should get interesting.
[01:28:58.730 --> 01:29:00.610]  You guys, I've only been going for about 22 minutes,
[01:29:00.610 --> 01:29:02.090]  but honestly, my recording gear
[01:29:02.090 --> 01:29:04.210]  has been giving me a couple of technical issues,
[01:29:04.210 --> 01:29:05.970]  and my throat is obviously burning out.
[01:29:05.970 --> 01:29:06.970]  So I'm going to wrap this up
[01:29:06.970 --> 01:29:09.970]  while I've still got a quality podcast on the screen.
[01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:12.130]  I don't want to lose any of the stuff I recorded.

[01:29:42.130 --> 01:29:43.850]  so I quit getting glitches in the recording gear,
[01:29:43.850 --> 01:29:46.210]  and I don't have to wrap up the end so quickly.
[01:29:46.210 --> 01:29:48.250]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Roger.
[01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:51.730]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:29:53.170 --> 01:29:54.850]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:56.650]  It's time for episode 363
[01:29:56.650 --> 01:29:58.930]  of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:29:58.930 --> 01:30:02.210]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[01:30:02.210 --> 01:30:05.290]  If you need new regular or feminized seeds for your garden,
[01:30:05.290 --> 01:30:07.970]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[01:30:07.970 --> 01:30:12.370]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:13.650]  I like to start the episodes off
[01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:15.530]  by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:17.370]  I just finished the last dab
[01:30:17.370 --> 01:30:19.170]  of the Orange Skittles Ambrosia.
[01:30:19.170 --> 01:30:21.250]  That left a nice orange flavor in my mouth,
[01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:22.690]  gave me a nice head buzz.
[01:30:22.690 --> 01:30:24.850]  I followed that up with the last dab
[01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:27.410]  of the Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract
[01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:28.890]  from Fuego Extracts.
[01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:29.970]  That was delicious.
[01:30:29.970 --> 01:30:33.410]  The combo made me super rambly and gave me a lot of energy.
[01:30:33.410 --> 01:30:36.410]  So this will be a fun podcast.
[01:30:36.410 --> 01:30:37.850]  If you've been following along,
[01:30:37.850 --> 01:30:40.930]  you know I'm doing a long series of grow lessons.
[01:30:40.930 --> 01:30:42.610]  If you haven't been following along,
[01:30:42.610 --> 01:30:45.730]  I suggest you go back to episode 351
[01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:47.530]  and start there and get caught up.
[01:30:47.530 --> 01:30:49.650]  That will give you a solid foundation
[01:30:49.650 --> 01:30:53.210]  on planning your grow and getting prepared for your new grow.
[01:30:53.210 --> 01:30:54.730]  If you've been following along,
[01:30:54.730 --> 01:30:56.590]  you know that we've selected our space,
[01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.010]  we've selected our equipment,
[01:30:58.010 --> 01:30:59.890]  we've done a lot of talk about genetics,
[01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:01.570]  and now this episode is going to be
[01:31:01.570 --> 01:31:03.690]  about sprouting our new seeds.
[01:31:03.690 --> 01:31:05.130]  Let's not waste too much time.
[01:31:05.130 --> 01:31:07.130]  Let's jump right into it.
[01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:08.490]  Seeds can be expensive,
[01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:10.290]  depending on who you ordered them from,
[01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:12.490]  how many you bought, what kind you purchased.
[01:31:13.330 --> 01:31:15.130]  You may have spent a lot of money on seeds.
[01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:17.690]  Before you think about germinating your new seeds,
[01:31:17.690 --> 01:31:21.690]  I highly recommend you have your veg area ready to rock
[01:31:21.690 --> 01:31:25.410]  before you even think about starting your seeds.
[01:31:25.410 --> 01:31:27.650]  You're going to think, oh, I can just germinate these seeds
[01:31:27.650 --> 01:31:28.970]  and then I'll build up this veg room
[01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:30.470]  in the next couple of days.
[01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:32.870]  And then while they veg, I'll work on the flower room.
[01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:35.870]  Once you get plants going, you start time traveling.
[01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:39.010]  Things go so much more quickly than you anticipate.
[01:31:39.010 --> 01:31:40.890]  Things pop up, things get in your way,
[01:31:40.890 --> 01:31:41.970]  then you fall behind.
[01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:44.170]  Then those seeds you just paid a bunch of money for
[01:31:44.170 --> 01:31:46.370]  start growing funky, they get out of control,
[01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:48.250]  and you've got shitty plants to start with
[01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:50.130]  and you're frustrated from the beginning.
[01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:52.810]  So before you germinate your seeds,
[01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:55.290]  have your veg space prepared.
[01:31:55.290 --> 01:31:57.530]  That is my very first piece of advice to you
[01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:59.590]  that will save you a lot of frustration.
[01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:00.850]  Now, my second piece of advice
[01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:03.070]  is to start with quality seed.
[01:32:03.070 --> 01:32:05.330]  Try to get your seeds from a reputable vendor
[01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:07.910]  and also from a reputable breeder.
[01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:10.210]  Don't fall for hype when you're shopping for seeds.
[01:32:10.210 --> 01:32:11.210]  Don't be sold.
[01:32:11.210 --> 01:32:13.650]  Try to find somebody with a good reputation,
[01:32:13.650 --> 01:32:14.970]  somebody that you have heard of,
[01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:17.010]  and also try to buy those seeds
[01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:18.750]  from a vendor with a good reputation,
[01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:19.870]  somebody that you have heard of,
[01:32:19.870 --> 01:32:22.970]  somebody that has a good relationship with the breeders.
[01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.650]  And if you're going to buy seeds online,
[01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:27.850]  I recommend you buy from a seed vendor in the United States.
[01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:30.130]  That way you don't have to risk customs.
[01:32:30.130 --> 01:32:33.010]  Of course, I recommend the Helladank Seed Company.
[01:32:33.010 --> 01:32:35.450]  I also recommend the Seed Bazaar,
[01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:38.710]  and I can also vouch for Southern Oregon Seeds.
[01:32:38.710 --> 01:32:40.450]  Those are three quality seed vendors
[01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:41.690]  that I trust and respect,
[01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:43.250]  and I work with them personally,
[01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:45.130]  so I know they will take good care of you.
[01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:47.490]  I'm not bashing any other seed company.
[01:32:47.490 --> 01:32:50.370]  I'm just saying I rely on these three companies.
[01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:51.370]  I have worked with them.
[01:32:51.370 --> 01:32:52.890]  I've got a relationship with them,
[01:32:52.890 --> 01:32:55.130]  and I know they are rock solid.
[01:32:55.130 --> 01:32:57.690]  So I recommend you start with a quality seed,
[01:32:57.690 --> 01:33:00.130]  something you know what the parents of that seed were,
[01:33:00.130 --> 01:33:02.070]  something you know where it came from.
[01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:03.690]  If you don't have access
[01:33:03.690 --> 01:33:05.890]  to fancy-labeled expensive seeds,
[01:33:05.890 --> 01:33:07.090]  grow what you've got.
[01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:09.410]  In an ideal world, we would all go to the store,
[01:33:09.410 --> 01:33:10.410]  and we'd look at the shelf,
[01:33:10.410 --> 01:33:12.130]  and we'd say, you've got that strain?
[01:33:12.130 --> 01:33:13.330]  That was the best I've ever smoked.
[01:33:13.330 --> 01:33:14.530]  I want seeds of that.
[01:33:14.530 --> 01:33:16.730]  And I get that that's everybody's fantasy.
[01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:17.770]  That day is coming.
[01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:20.250]  Unfortunately, we are not there yet for everybody.
[01:33:20.250 --> 01:33:22.570]  Some people are going to have to be resourceful.
[01:33:22.570 --> 01:33:24.490]  You may have bought a bag of weed 10 years ago
[01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:26.650]  at some random place, and it had seeds in it.
[01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:28.450]  Now you're gonna have to grow those seeds.
[01:33:28.450 --> 01:33:30.290]  You never know what you're gonna get out of those seeds.
[01:33:30.290 --> 01:33:31.410]  You could find duds.
[01:33:31.410 --> 01:33:32.850]  You could find hermaphrodites.
[01:33:32.850 --> 01:33:35.730]  You may find the next magical strain in there.
[01:33:35.730 --> 01:33:37.250]  So grow what you've got.
[01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:38.910]  No matter where your seeds come from,
[01:33:38.910 --> 01:33:41.270]  whether they're regular, whether they're feminized seeds,
[01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:42.710]  pay close attention to them.
[01:33:42.710 --> 01:33:44.110]  Pay attention for males.
[01:33:44.110 --> 01:33:45.790]  Pay attention for hermaphrodism.
[01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:47.150]  Pay attention for problems.
[01:33:47.150 --> 01:33:48.350]  You will have to keep an eye out
[01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:49.910]  when you're growing from seed.
[01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:52.190]  Now, if you've got a bag of seeds lying around,
[01:33:52.190 --> 01:33:53.750]  and you don't know what any of them are,
[01:33:53.750 --> 01:33:56.550]  it's just perhaps a sandwich bag or a little mason jar
[01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:59.110]  just stuffed with random seeds from bags of cannabis
[01:33:59.110 --> 01:34:00.590]  you've gone through over time,
[01:34:00.590 --> 01:34:02.350]  and you can't decide what to grow,
[01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:04.510]  I go for the really healthy-looking seeds.
[01:34:04.510 --> 01:34:08.070]  And by healthy, I mean probably darker, probably bigger.
[01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:09.710]  A lot of people like the tiger stripes.
[01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:10.750]  That's always a good sign.
[01:34:10.750 --> 01:34:12.470]  Some seeds will not make tiger stripes,
[01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:14.270]  no matter how long they grow, no matter how mature,
[01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:16.170]  no matter how healthy and strong they are.
[01:34:16.170 --> 01:34:17.230]  They just won't stripe up.
[01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:18.910]  That's just a genetic thing.
[01:34:18.910 --> 01:34:20.810]  I prefer the darker-colored seeds.
[01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:23.030]  The harder seeds, I give them a little press on the table.
[01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.990]  I hope they don't crack.
[01:34:23.990 --> 01:34:25.830]  If they don't crack, that's probably a good seed.
[01:34:25.830 --> 01:34:27.590]  If it cracks, it obviously isn't gonna grow.
[01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:28.950]  That's a dead seed.
[01:34:28.950 --> 01:34:31.070]  A lot of people like a larger cannabis seed,
[01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:32.870]  but I've noticed that a lot of strains
[01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:35.130]  produce little tiny seeds.
[01:34:35.130 --> 01:34:37.350]  So sometimes a little tiny cannabis seed
[01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:39.750]  can produce a seriously potent plant.
[01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:41.670]  Don't judge it too much by the size.
[01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:44.110]  Judge it more by the health of the seed.
[01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:46.830]  A lot of the grayer, light-colored seeds will grow.
[01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:49.230]  I don't put those in my packs because people freak out.
[01:34:49.230 --> 01:34:50.750]  I grow those myself.
[01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:52.910]  But those lighter gray, the paler-colored seeds,
[01:34:52.910 --> 01:34:53.750]  those will grow.
[01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:55.750]  The white seeds, those are more questionable.
[01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:57.930]  I don't think the white seeds do as well.
[01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:59.790]  The gray, kind of silver-shiny seeds,
[01:34:59.790 --> 01:35:01.750]  those usually have a good takeoff.
[01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:04.390]  The darker ones, those take off quite quickly.
[01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:05.790]  And then, of course, you get those bigger,
[01:35:05.790 --> 01:35:07.270]  harder tiger-stripe seeds.
[01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:08.910]  Those really have a lot of vigor,
[01:35:08.910 --> 01:35:11.350]  and they take off really quickly for you.
[01:35:11.350 --> 01:35:14.950]  So seed health is important, selecting healthy seeds.
[01:35:14.950 --> 01:35:16.350]  If you've got a big bag of seeds,
[01:35:16.350 --> 01:35:19.350]  try to select the healthiest-looking beans out of that bag.
[01:35:19.350 --> 01:35:20.970]  Maybe a couple of them just call you.
[01:35:20.970 --> 01:35:23.230]  Maybe you've got a bag of a thousand seeds,
[01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:24.070]  and two of them just go,
[01:35:24.070 --> 01:35:26.510]  hey, bro, I'm the seeds you want to grow right now.
[01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:28.030]  Listen to that kind of stuff.
[01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:29.990]  That is usually accurate.
[01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.950]  All right, now we've got our veg space ready.
[01:35:31.950 --> 01:35:33.790]  We know what to look for in quality seeds.
[01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:35.190]  We've got some seeds on hand,
[01:35:35.190 --> 01:35:37.310]  and it is time to germinate our seeds.
[01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:38.710]  What do I mean by germinate?
[01:35:38.710 --> 01:35:40.910]  That's just a fancy word for starting the seeds.
[01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:43.590]  We need to give them the proper conditions
[01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:44.670]  to make them start.
[01:35:44.670 --> 01:35:45.950]  We want to crack the seed open.
[01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:46.790]  We don't want to do it.
[01:35:46.790 --> 01:35:48.050]  We want it to happen naturally.
[01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.030]  We want the seed to crack itself open,
[01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:52.390]  and we want a little tiny taproot to come fishing out,
[01:35:52.390 --> 01:35:54.630]  and that is the start of life.
[01:35:54.630 --> 01:35:57.730]  In nature, those seeds would fall out of last year's bud.
[01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:58.830]  Winter would come.
[01:35:58.830 --> 01:36:00.350]  It would knock those seeds out.
[01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:01.550]  The buds would dry.
[01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:03.870]  The wind and the moisture would knock those seeds
[01:36:03.870 --> 01:36:04.750]  out of those buds.
[01:36:05.230 --> 01:36:06.550]  Those buds would fall into the ground.
[01:36:06.550 --> 01:36:07.390]  Winter would come,
[01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:09.390]  and everything would be frozen for a little while.
[01:36:09.390 --> 01:36:11.710]  As the spring came and the winter frost
[01:36:11.710 --> 01:36:14.350]  or the winter moisture started moistening down
[01:36:14.350 --> 01:36:15.270]  into the soil,
[01:36:15.270 --> 01:36:18.050]  those seeds would begin to receive moisture
[01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:20.030]  and warmth from nature.
[01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:22.170]  That would trigger them to germinate.
[01:36:22.170 --> 01:36:23.110]  Then they would sprout up.
[01:36:23.110 --> 01:36:24.970]  They would find their way up, dig up out of the soil.
[01:36:24.970 --> 01:36:27.030]  They'd start seeing sun, and they'd go, here I am,
[01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:28.010]  and then they would live,
[01:36:28.010 --> 01:36:30.430]  and they would become little baby cannabis plants.
[01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:32.430]  Now, with human involvement, what we've done,
[01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:34.750]  we have collected the seeds before they fall out
[01:36:34.750 --> 01:36:35.590]  of the buds.
[01:36:35.590 --> 01:36:37.590]  When I breed, I let the plants get done.
[01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:38.830]  I let the seeds get finished.
[01:36:38.830 --> 01:36:39.790]  I cut the plants down.
[01:36:39.790 --> 01:36:40.630]  I let them hang.
[01:36:40.630 --> 01:36:41.450]  They dry.
[01:36:41.450 --> 01:36:43.230]  Then I basically crumble up the buds,
[01:36:43.230 --> 01:36:44.750]  and I manually remove the seeds.
[01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:46.450]  There are several methods of doing that.
[01:36:46.450 --> 01:36:49.170]  That's not important right now, but that process happened.
[01:36:49.170 --> 01:36:51.130]  Then those seeds were passed on to you.
[01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:53.510]  Now, you have to play the role of mother nature.
[01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:56.030]  We have to give these seeds the proper environment
[01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:58.890]  to trigger them to start their life.
[01:36:58.890 --> 01:37:01.350]  The two main things that are going to start our seeds
[01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:02.950]  are water and warmth.
[01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:06.750]  The main thing being water, warmth, very secondary to that.
[01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:10.190]  Warmth will speed up the process and make them much happier.
[01:37:10.190 --> 01:37:13.070]  Now, there are countless ways to start new seeds.
[01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:16.590]  I'm going to cover four or five methods here in this episode,
[01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:19.510]  and I'm going to start with the method I use personally.
[01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:21.910]  I like the old school paper towel technique.
[01:37:21.910 --> 01:37:23.430]  It is very simple.
[01:37:23.430 --> 01:37:25.950]  I get a plate out of the cupboard, just a glass plate,
[01:37:25.950 --> 01:37:28.550]  like you'd serve a meal on or make a sandwich.
[01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:30.230]  I also get a paper towel,
[01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:33.790]  just like you'd use to clean up that meal or that sandwich.
[01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:37.470]  I fold the paper towel one time, then I fold it again.
[01:37:37.470 --> 01:37:40.270]  Now, you've just got a little rectangular paper towel.
[01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:43.430]  I set that paper towel onto the glass plate,
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:45.470]  and then I get a bottle of water.
[01:37:45.470 --> 01:37:46.950]  I prefer bottled water for this
[01:37:46.950 --> 01:37:49.470]  because I don't want the chlorine or whatever else is in
[01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:52.230]  my tap water affecting my new seedlings.
[01:37:52.230 --> 01:37:54.910]  So I've got the folded paper towel sitting on the plate.
[01:37:54.910 --> 01:37:57.750]  I simply soak that paper towel with water.
[01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:59.270]  It will only hold so much.
[01:37:59.270 --> 01:38:01.550]  I simply saturate it.
[01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:03.950]  Then I tip the plate to the side to make sure
[01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:06.310]  all that excess water runs out of the paper towel
[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:07.470]  and off of that plate.
[01:38:07.470 --> 01:38:09.150]  Just drain it right off into the sink.
[01:38:09.150 --> 01:38:10.710]  That water's gone.
[01:38:10.710 --> 01:38:13.190]  So now you've got a soggy paper towel
[01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:14.470]  in the middle of a plate.
[01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:16.550]  I place my seeds in the paper towel,
[01:38:16.550 --> 01:38:18.910]  and then I gently fold it one more time.
[01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:20.390]  If you want to fold it another time,
[01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:21.830]  you can and make a little tiny square.
[01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:24.710]  That's fine, but I think that first fold will be just fine.
[01:38:24.710 --> 01:38:27.350]  Just fold it up to where those seeds are in the middle
[01:38:27.350 --> 01:38:28.190]  and they're getting wet
[01:38:28.190 --> 01:38:29.790]  and they're not getting any light.
[01:38:29.790 --> 01:38:31.350]  The way that that wet paper towel works,
[01:38:31.350 --> 01:38:32.750]  it'll kind of seal itself up
[01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:34.390]  so the seeds won't move around too much.
[01:38:34.390 --> 01:38:36.230]  There won't be any light in there.
[01:38:36.230 --> 01:38:38.750]  So you've got some seeds folded up in a wet paper towel
[01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:40.350]  and those are sitting on a plate.
[01:38:40.350 --> 01:38:43.790]  Now at this point, you've got a couple of options.
[01:38:43.790 --> 01:38:45.990]  If you were able to pay attention to those seeds
[01:38:45.990 --> 01:38:48.230]  and be around them all the time
[01:38:48.230 --> 01:38:50.430]  and make sure they don't get dry,
[01:38:50.430 --> 01:38:52.510]  you can just leave them on that plate
[01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.550]  and leave them exposed.
[01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:57.630]  If it's not too hot or not too cold in your area,
[01:38:57.630 --> 01:39:01.230]  they will sprout just fine just left sitting like that.
[01:39:01.230 --> 01:39:04.710]  If you want to slow down the amount of moisture
[01:39:04.710 --> 01:39:06.070]  leaving that paper towel
[01:39:06.070 --> 01:39:08.190]  and try to keep it moist a little bit longer
[01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:10.270]  without having to pay so much attention,
[01:39:10.270 --> 01:39:11.830]  just set another plate over it.
[01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:13.150]  Flip the plate upside down
[01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:14.870]  and set it on top of the first plate,
[01:39:14.870 --> 01:39:16.630]  just like you do if you had a sandwich in there
[01:39:16.630 --> 01:39:18.590]  and you didn't want anything to get to the sandwich.
[01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:20.070]  So you just got two plates
[01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:22.270]  with your little folded up paper towel in there.
[01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:24.550]  You have to keep it moist at all times.
[01:39:24.550 --> 01:39:26.910]  Do not let it get dry.
[01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:29.630]  If you feel like you're going to get forgetful
[01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:32.710]  or if you need to go to work for an extended period of time
[01:39:32.710 --> 01:39:35.750]  and you cannot monitor the moisture of your new seedlings,
[01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:38.510]  you can always set them in a baggie.
[01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:41.270]  Put your folded paper towel with the moisture in it
[01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:42.510]  in a baggie.
[01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:44.790]  This will give the moisture nowhere to go.
[01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:47.310]  It will be trapped inside that little environment.
[01:39:47.310 --> 01:39:48.670]  Just make sure you check on them
[01:39:48.670 --> 01:39:50.830]  as soon as you get home from work.
[01:39:50.830 --> 01:39:53.510]  If you leave that wet paper towel folded up in a baggie
[01:39:53.510 --> 01:39:55.790]  in a really warm spot for too long,
[01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:58.310]  you can create a mildew situation.
[01:39:58.310 --> 01:39:59.990]  So make sure you pop that open,
[01:39:59.990 --> 01:40:01.310]  get some fresh air in there,
[01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:04.390]  and check on that as soon as you get home from work.
[01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:06.750]  So it sounds really easy because it is.
[01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:09.110]  You are folding a paper towel into a square.
[01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:10.230]  You're moistening it.
[01:40:10.230 --> 01:40:12.390]  You're letting the excess moisture run off.
[01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:14.550]  We set the seeds onto that moist paper towel
[01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:16.270]  and then we fold it to cover them up.
[01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:17.350]  And then if you need to,
[01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:20.190]  place another plate over it to slow down the dry time.
[01:40:20.190 --> 01:40:21.390]  If you're really forgetful
[01:40:21.390 --> 01:40:22.910]  and you're going to be away for a while,
[01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:25.590]  put it in a baggie to retain that moisture.
[01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:28.470]  Then set it somewhere semi-warm.
[01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:31.270]  Most of the time, if you're comfortable in that area,
[01:40:31.270 --> 01:40:33.990]  your seedlings are probably comfortable as well.
[01:40:33.990 --> 01:40:36.590]  Room temperature is acceptable for seedlings.
[01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:39.910]  A great spot for seedlings, if you do not forget them,
[01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:41.630]  is on top of the refrigerator.
[01:40:41.630 --> 01:40:42.830]  That temperature that happens
[01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:46.470]  right on top of the refrigerator is perfect for seedlings.
[01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:48.870]  If you don't forget them, put them in a baggie,
[01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:50.030]  set them right on top.
[01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:53.750]  They should be ready in 12 to 24, maybe 36 hours.
[01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:55.950]  If you've got one of those old big TVs,
[01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:58.270]  nobody's got those big old TVs anymore.
[01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:59.790]  They used to get warm on the back.
[01:40:59.790 --> 01:41:03.350]  That was a great spot to set seedlings in a baggie.
[01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:06.670]  It was on the back of the old Sony Trinitron 36-inch TV
[01:41:06.670 --> 01:41:09.230]  where it got warm from playing video games all day.
[01:41:09.230 --> 01:41:12.110]  That would be the perfect temp for seedlings.
[01:41:12.110 --> 01:41:13.750]  Other than those subtle heat sources
[01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.750]  like the top of the fridge or the back of the TV,
[01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:17.470]  I really don't recommend a heat mat
[01:41:17.470 --> 01:41:19.870]  for germinating new seeds or for your clones.
[01:41:19.870 --> 01:41:21.670]  I've seen more clones and seeds
[01:41:21.670 --> 01:41:23.750]  destroyed, roasted, and barbecued
[01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.550]  than I have ever seen assisted by one of those heat mats,
[01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:28.950]  but I'm gonna talk about that more later in the episode,
[01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:32.390]  I think, so let's skip that for now and try to stay focused.
[01:41:32.390 --> 01:41:33.870]  All right, so we've got our seedlings.
[01:41:33.870 --> 01:41:35.710]  They are folded up in a paper towel.
[01:41:35.710 --> 01:41:36.830]  We're keeping them moist.
[01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:37.870]  We don't want them soggy.
[01:41:37.870 --> 01:41:39.710]  We don't want them dripping all the time.
[01:41:39.710 --> 01:41:42.390]  We wanna keep them moist and comfortable.
[01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:43.830]  So you've got them folded in the paper towel
[01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:45.790]  and you are checking on them every few hours
[01:41:45.790 --> 01:41:46.990]  if you were able.
[01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:48.030]  They're easy to check on.
[01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:49.670]  Just set your hand right on that paper towel.
[01:41:49.670 --> 01:41:50.590]  Don't crush the seeds.
[01:41:50.590 --> 01:41:52.310]  Just set your hand on there gently.
[01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:54.710]  And if the paper towel is kind of cold, kind of chilly,
[01:41:54.710 --> 01:41:56.310]  they're probably wet enough.
[01:41:56.310 --> 01:41:58.070]  If you don't feel like it's wet enough,
[01:41:58.070 --> 01:41:59.110]  moisten it up a little bit.
[01:41:59.110 --> 01:42:00.070]  Get your water bottle
[01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:01.790]  and just pour the water on there gently
[01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:03.630]  and then tip the plate over
[01:42:03.630 --> 01:42:05.910]  to where the excess water runs off into the sink,
[01:42:05.910 --> 01:42:06.990]  and then you've got them moistened up
[01:42:06.990 --> 01:42:08.350]  for the rest of the day.
[01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:12.350]  They should only be in this paper towel for 12 to 24,
[01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:15.430]  maybe 36 or 48 hours before you see them
[01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:16.950]  starting to pop open.
[01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:18.470]  It will pop open on one side
[01:42:18.470 --> 01:42:20.590]  and a little white tail will start coming out.
[01:42:20.590 --> 01:42:23.470]  That is exactly what we're looking for.
[01:42:23.470 --> 01:42:25.070]  That is the start of life.
[01:42:25.070 --> 01:42:26.070]  That is a taproot.
[01:42:26.070 --> 01:42:27.750]  That is the beginning of everything.
[01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:29.910]  That little root is gonna dig down into the pot
[01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:30.950]  once we pot it,
[01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:33.030]  and it's gonna dig down and start finding nutrients,
[01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:34.230]  and that's gonna be the legs.
[01:42:34.230 --> 01:42:36.270]  That's gonna be the foundation.
[01:42:36.270 --> 01:42:37.990]  And then it's gonna start shooting that seedling
[01:42:37.990 --> 01:42:39.750]  straight upward toward the light,
[01:42:39.750 --> 01:42:41.350]  and then it's gonna shoot little leaves out of there,
[01:42:41.350 --> 01:42:42.790]  and that little seedling will fall off,
[01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:43.910]  and then you've got a little plant.
[01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:46.870]  So that is the start of everything happening right there,
[01:42:46.870 --> 01:42:47.710]  and you get to see it
[01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:49.830]  because you've just got it right there in that paper towel.
[01:42:49.830 --> 01:42:51.590]  It's not buried under anything.
[01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:52.710]  So you can check on them.
[01:42:52.710 --> 01:42:54.070]  Check on them about 12 hours.
[01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:56.350]  If you don't see anything, check on them in 24 hours.
[01:42:56.350 --> 01:42:58.710]  If you don't see anything, go 36.
[01:42:58.710 --> 01:43:00.510]  You're gonna get impatient after 24 hours.
[01:43:00.510 --> 01:43:02.270]  You'll be checking on them every four to six hours.
[01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:03.110]  Don't worry.
[01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:03.950]  Just keep checking.
[01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:05.270]  Don't forget about them.
[01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:06.990]  We only need maybe an eighth of an inch,
[01:43:06.990 --> 01:43:09.990]  maybe a quarter of an inch of that taproot to pop out
[01:43:09.990 --> 01:43:12.470]  before our seedlings are ready to put into soil,
[01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:14.310]  but we will get to that.
[01:43:14.310 --> 01:43:17.030]  So I think I covered how to germinate seeds
[01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.870]  in a paper towel.
[01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:20.030]  You fold it, you wet it, you drain it,
[01:43:20.030 --> 01:43:21.750]  put the seeds in there, fold it again,
[01:43:21.750 --> 01:43:24.510]  and then you keep an eye on it and keep it moist.
[01:43:24.510 --> 01:43:28.230]  Keep it slightly warm, but don't roast it.
[01:43:28.230 --> 01:43:30.390]  If you think you might forget about your seedlings,
[01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:32.510]  place the paper towel setup in a baggie,
[01:43:32.510 --> 01:43:34.990]  and that will keep them moist until you open it.
[01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:37.270]  Once again, don't forget about them.
[01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:38.830]  Make sure you check on them.
[01:43:38.830 --> 01:43:40.430]  Then when you unfold that paper towel
[01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:42.270]  and you've got little taproot sticking out,
[01:43:42.270 --> 01:43:43.830]  that's when it's time to get ready
[01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:46.190]  to put them into your potting mix,
[01:43:46.190 --> 01:43:48.590]  so we're gonna talk about that a little bit later.
[01:43:48.590 --> 01:43:50.590]  The only thing left to cover in this section
[01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:54.390]  is what if those seeds don't pop open after 48 hours?
[01:43:54.390 --> 01:43:55.870]  The only thing you can really do
[01:43:55.870 --> 01:43:58.710]  is wait a little bit longer, maybe increase the heat.
[01:43:58.710 --> 01:44:00.550]  If you didn't already set them on the fridge,
[01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:02.510]  maybe set them up there on top of the refrigerator
[01:44:02.510 --> 01:44:05.030]  where it's a little warmer, maybe lessen the moisture.
[01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:06.750]  Maybe you've got them a little too wet.
[01:44:06.750 --> 01:44:09.310]  Maybe just keep that paper towel just damp.
[01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:11.030]  Maybe you've still got a little bit of a chance,
[01:44:11.030 --> 01:44:13.950]  but if they haven't opened after 48 or 72 hours,
[01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:16.950]  I would consider starting a fresh batch of seeds
[01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:18.110]  at that point.
[01:44:18.110 --> 01:44:20.150]  Now, if it is really cold in your environment,
[01:44:20.150 --> 01:44:22.630]  it will take longer for your seeds to germinate,
[01:44:22.630 --> 01:44:23.750]  so expect that.
[01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:25.870]  If you're growing in the basement in Colorado,
[01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:28.230]  you've got them sitting right on a concrete floor.
[01:44:28.230 --> 01:44:29.310]  That's gonna take longer.
[01:44:29.310 --> 01:44:30.910]  Consider your environment.
[01:44:30.910 --> 01:44:33.710]  Like I said earlier, the warmth will speed things up,
[01:44:33.710 --> 01:44:36.390]  but that too can go wrong in excess,
[01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:37.990]  so try to stay in the right area.
[01:44:37.990 --> 01:44:40.630]  Try to be about 70 to 85 degrees-ish,
[01:44:40.630 --> 01:44:44.390]  and you should be okay with rapid growth for your seeds.
[01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:46.510]  Now let's talk about our next method
[01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:47.870]  for sprouting our seeds.
[01:44:47.870 --> 01:44:50.750]  Our next method is using rapid rooters or root riots
[01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:54.110]  or whatever type of plugs are available in your area.
[01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:58.910]  Although I am not including rockwool cubes in this section.
[01:44:58.910 --> 01:45:01.230]  I don't like rockwool cubes for sprouting seeds.
[01:45:01.230 --> 01:45:03.070]  They do not work well for sprouting seeds.
[01:45:03.070 --> 01:45:04.630]  I would not recommend that.
[01:45:04.630 --> 01:45:06.150]  If it's what you've got,
[01:45:06.150 --> 01:45:08.910]  do it similarly to what I recommend here
[01:45:08.910 --> 01:45:10.230]  with the rapid rooters,
[01:45:10.310 --> 01:45:12.990]  but before you use your rockwool cubes,
[01:45:12.990 --> 01:45:14.470]  make sure you clean them out
[01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:17.470]  and make sure you soak them in a pH-balanced solution.
[01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:20.030]  Rinse them very well to get anything out of them,
[01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:21.830]  then soak them either in clean water
[01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:26.150]  or a light nutrient solution that has been pH-ed around six.
[01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:27.990]  You don't wanna use rockwool cubes
[01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:30.670]  without rinsing them and adjusting the pH.
[01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:35.270]  So this is all about rapid rooters or root riot plugs.
[01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:37.990]  When we start with these plugs, we need to soak them.
[01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:39.390]  So I get a container.
[01:45:39.390 --> 01:45:41.390]  Based on the amount of plugs I'm going to use,
[01:45:41.390 --> 01:45:43.550]  I'm generally using a five-gallon bucket.
[01:45:43.550 --> 01:45:45.190]  I think they're sold in a 50-pack,
[01:45:45.190 --> 01:45:47.270]  so most of the time I just do all 50
[01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:50.110]  and I either do 50 clones or 50 seedlings.
[01:45:50.110 --> 01:45:51.670]  I just use the whole package.
[01:45:51.670 --> 01:45:53.270]  You soak as many as you need.
[01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:54.830]  What I do is I get a container
[01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:56.910]  that will fit enough water to soak as many plugs
[01:45:56.910 --> 01:45:58.070]  as I'm gonna use.
[01:45:58.070 --> 01:46:02.310]  I adjust the pH to somewhere between six and 6.3.
[01:46:02.310 --> 01:46:04.550]  I usually place the rapid rooter plugs
[01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:06.150]  back into the rapid rooter tray.
[01:46:06.150 --> 01:46:07.590]  If you're not using the tray, that's okay.
[01:46:08.230 --> 01:46:09.190]  You don't need it, but that's usually what I do.
[01:46:09.190 --> 01:46:10.750]  I put it right in the tray.
[01:46:10.750 --> 01:46:13.310]  Then I take a seed and I insert the seed
[01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:15.910]  into the rapid rooter plug.
[01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:19.830]  That seed goes pointy end down.
[01:46:19.830 --> 01:46:22.430]  If you look at your seeds, it's got a round end
[01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:23.750]  and it's got a pointy end.
[01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:25.770]  It will be obvious when you look at it.
[01:46:25.770 --> 01:46:27.350]  The pointy end goes down.
[01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:30.270]  This is important because of the way that the seed grows.
[01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:34.190]  Pointy end down, when you're putting it into a rapid rooter
[01:46:34.190 --> 01:46:35.390]  or any sort of a cube,
[01:46:35.390 --> 01:46:39.950]  or if you're going directly into soil, pointy end down.
[01:46:39.950 --> 01:46:43.030]  Also, if you are going into a rapid rooter,
[01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:45.030]  if you're going into a root riot cube,
[01:46:45.030 --> 01:46:46.230]  if you're going into soil,
[01:46:46.230 --> 01:46:48.370]  or if you're going against my advice
[01:46:48.370 --> 01:46:50.490]  and you're going directly into rock wool,
[01:46:50.490 --> 01:46:52.870]  it is always suggested that you plant your seeds
[01:46:52.870 --> 01:46:54.830]  about one knuckle deep.
[01:46:54.830 --> 01:46:56.590]  Just go, just the tip of your finger,
[01:46:56.590 --> 01:46:59.350]  just push it in until you press that first knuckle,
[01:46:59.350 --> 01:47:00.990]  right that first bend in your finger.
[01:47:00.990 --> 01:47:02.390]  That's far enough, stop pushing.
[01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:04.450]  That seedling is deep enough into the soil.
[01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:06.090]  It's deep enough into that cube.
[01:47:06.090 --> 01:47:06.930]  It will live there.
[01:47:06.930 --> 01:47:08.610]  It doesn't need to be buried way down in there.
[01:47:08.610 --> 01:47:10.430]  It stands a much better chance
[01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:13.850]  if it's just about knuckle deep is all you need to go.
[01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:15.730]  So after I've got all my seedlings planted
[01:47:15.730 --> 01:47:17.330]  and I've got all my cubes labeled,
[01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:18.750]  make sure you label each cube.
[01:47:18.750 --> 01:47:20.310]  If you're planning different strains,
[01:47:20.310 --> 01:47:23.010]  make sure you've got a way to label each cube
[01:47:23.010 --> 01:47:24.030]  so you know what you've got.
[01:47:24.030 --> 01:47:26.770]  Also label, if you're doing more than one paper towel
[01:47:26.770 --> 01:47:29.290]  of seeds, make sure you label that paper towel some way.
[01:47:29.290 --> 01:47:31.710]  Most of you are just doing one pack of seeds or one strain,
[01:47:31.710 --> 01:47:32.770]  but if you're doing multiple,
[01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:34.770]  please carefully label things.
[01:47:34.770 --> 01:47:35.930]  So we've got our seeds.
[01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:37.870]  They are in our rapid rooter cubes.
[01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:39.250]  They are carefully labeled.
[01:47:39.250 --> 01:47:40.370]  They are nice and moist.
[01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:42.970]  They are about knuckle deep down into the cube.
[01:47:42.970 --> 01:47:46.010]  Now I place them under a very light light.
[01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:48.890]  You don't need very powerful lighting for sprouting seeds.
[01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:52.610]  A really weak LED or a T5 kind of high up
[01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:53.830]  is plenty of lighting.
[01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:56.810]  A compact fluorescent is probably just enough light.
[01:47:56.810 --> 01:47:59.410]  You don't need to go extreme for a seedling,
[01:47:59.410 --> 01:48:00.910]  just enough to encourage it to grow.
[01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:02.530]  Once it gets bigger, we do need light.
[01:48:03.290 --> 01:48:05.370]  But right now we don't need ridiculous lighting
[01:48:05.370 --> 01:48:06.330]  for a small seedling.
[01:48:06.330 --> 01:48:08.690]  So place it under a light that will give it warmth
[01:48:08.690 --> 01:48:10.470]  and that will encourage it to grow.
[01:48:10.470 --> 01:48:11.890]  Now in about two or three days,
[01:48:11.890 --> 01:48:13.690]  maybe four or five days at the latest,
[01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:16.290]  you should see a little sprout pop out of your cube
[01:48:16.290 --> 01:48:18.530]  and you have now got a little seedling.
[01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:21.450]  Now that seedling can live in that little rapid rooter
[01:48:21.450 --> 01:48:24.550]  for several days, but it's going to need a forever home.
[01:48:24.550 --> 01:48:26.810]  It's gonna need to go into either some soil
[01:48:26.810 --> 01:48:29.390]  or a hydro setup fairly soon.
[01:48:29.390 --> 01:48:32.470]  While it's in that rapid rooter, we need to keep it warm.
[01:48:33.310 --> 01:48:35.470]  We need to keep it somewhere between 70 and 85 degrees
[01:48:35.470 --> 01:48:38.710]  and we need to keep that root cube moist at all times.
[01:48:38.710 --> 01:48:41.190]  Once it dries up, that plant has no life source
[01:48:41.190 --> 01:48:42.070]  and it will die.
[01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:45.610]  So keep it moist and keep it warm and keep it under a light.
[01:48:45.610 --> 01:48:47.510]  And then we need to think about getting it
[01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:51.590]  into a good potting mix or into a hydro system very soon
[01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:53.150]  so that it can thrive.
[01:48:53.150 --> 01:48:55.270]  So that is the basics of sprouting a seed
[01:48:55.270 --> 01:48:57.790]  in a rapid rooter or a root riot cube,
[01:48:57.790 --> 01:49:01.550]  or against my advice, if you choose to use a rockwool cube,
[01:49:01.550 --> 01:49:03.310]  you would use a similar method.
[01:49:03.310 --> 01:49:06.410]  Basically soak it with the proper pH solution,
[01:49:06.410 --> 01:49:09.310]  then press the seedling in, pointy end down,
[01:49:09.310 --> 01:49:12.350]  and only go about a knuckle deep, set it under a light
[01:49:12.350 --> 01:49:15.030]  and leave it alone for two or three days.
[01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:17.190]  You should see a little sprout pop up.
[01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:19.270]  If you don't see the sprout pop up,
[01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:21.750]  look in the little hole and see what you see.
[01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.590]  Sometimes the seedling simply gets caught
[01:49:24.590 --> 01:49:27.110]  and it's bent over and it can't pop itself up
[01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:28.490]  out of the root cube.
[01:49:28.490 --> 01:49:29.390]  That happens.
[01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:34.310]  You can carefully get a pair of tweezers or a chopstick
[01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:37.990]  and very gently encourage that plant to grow straight up.
[01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:40.030]  Don't pull it out of the seed casing.
[01:49:40.030 --> 01:49:41.950]  Don't pull it out of the cube.
[01:49:41.950 --> 01:49:45.230]  Maybe spread the hole of the cube open just a little bit
[01:49:45.230 --> 01:49:46.710]  and encourage it to pop out of there.
[01:49:46.710 --> 01:49:49.110]  It just needs to bend up and come out.
[01:49:49.110 --> 01:49:52.270]  You can probably guide it out if you're gentle.
[01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:54.790]  If it's close to doing it on its own, don't touch it.
[01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:56.690]  Just let it struggle and it will come out.
[01:49:56.690 --> 01:49:58.190]  If you feel like it's been long enough
[01:49:58.190 --> 01:50:01.150]  and you're getting impatient, just give it a little tug.
[01:50:01.150 --> 01:50:02.670]  It may pop out for you.
[01:50:02.670 --> 01:50:04.990]  Keep in mind, you're risking killing this seedling
[01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:05.870]  if you get too rough.
[01:50:05.870 --> 01:50:08.110]  You're going to destroy it if you get too rough,
[01:50:08.110 --> 01:50:09.630]  but you've got a good chance.
[01:50:09.630 --> 01:50:12.590]  Just use your thumbs and spread that rapid rooter open
[01:50:12.590 --> 01:50:14.030]  just a little tiny bit,
[01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:16.150]  and you may open it just enough for that seed
[01:50:16.150 --> 01:50:18.630]  to unbind itself and be able to pop straight up.
[01:50:18.630 --> 01:50:19.630]  It may just be stuck.
[01:50:19.630 --> 01:50:22.070]  It's trying to move up and the two leaves on the top,
[01:50:22.070 --> 01:50:23.230]  they just got stuck somewhere.
[01:50:23.230 --> 01:50:24.550]  That happens quite a bit
[01:50:24.550 --> 01:50:26.470]  and it'll just have to break itself free.
[01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:27.550]  So pay attention to that
[01:50:27.550 --> 01:50:30.150]  if it doesn't pop up in four or five days.
[01:50:30.150 --> 01:50:31.270]  If the others have popped up
[01:50:31.270 --> 01:50:33.150]  and you've got one that didn't pop up, look in there.
[01:50:33.150 --> 01:50:36.710]  That could be the issue with that one seedling.
[01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:38.470]  Now let's kind of touch on another method
[01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:40.630]  that is very similar to the rapid rooters
[01:50:40.630 --> 01:50:43.530]  and the root riot cubes, but it is also very different.
[01:50:43.530 --> 01:50:46.810]  This next method, you cannot put this into a hydro kit
[01:50:46.810 --> 01:50:49.070]  as simply as you could a rapid rooter
[01:50:49.070 --> 01:50:51.790]  or as simply as you could a seed from a paper towel.
[01:50:51.790 --> 01:50:52.950]  I'm sure some people have done it.
[01:50:52.950 --> 01:50:55.210]  I'm sure some people do it, but it's not as easy.
[01:50:55.210 --> 01:50:58.730]  It's much more challenging and it's not as logical.
[01:50:58.730 --> 01:51:01.330]  So let's talk about using Jiffy cubes.
[01:51:01.330 --> 01:51:04.810]  Jiffy cubes are great if you're going to go into soil,
[01:51:04.810 --> 01:51:05.650]  but like I said,
[01:51:05.650 --> 01:51:08.170]  you can't really use them going into a hydro system.
[01:51:08.170 --> 01:51:09.410]  I'm sure there's somebody doing it
[01:51:09.410 --> 01:51:11.890]  gonna tell me I'm wrong, but it's not common.
[01:51:11.890 --> 01:51:15.490]  So a Jiffy cube, they're very similar to the rapid rooters,
[01:51:15.490 --> 01:51:18.250]  but they start off really small and you moisten them
[01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:20.510]  and they expand to the proper size.
[01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:22.190]  So you moisten them, they puff up,
[01:51:22.190 --> 01:51:24.150]  you squeeze the excess water out of them.
[01:51:24.150 --> 01:51:27.870]  Then from there, they work just like the rapid rooters
[01:51:27.870 --> 01:51:29.570]  or the root riot cubes.
[01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:33.030]  You place your seedling in there, pointy end down,
[01:51:33.030 --> 01:51:34.430]  you go about knuckle deep,
[01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:38.070]  and then you've got to keep your Jiffy cube moist
[01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:41.590]  just like you do with your other cubes.
[01:51:41.590 --> 01:51:44.430]  Now, if you're using rapid rooters or root riots
[01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:47.350]  or Jiffy cubes, or if you're going against my advice still
[01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:49.130]  and using the rock wool cubes,
[01:51:49.130 --> 01:51:53.530]  make sure not to get them too moist for too long.
[01:51:53.530 --> 01:51:57.170]  If they're too moist, it will simply rot your seedlings.
[01:51:57.170 --> 01:51:59.330]  They will turn green, they will turn brown,
[01:51:59.330 --> 01:52:00.570]  they will fall over and die,
[01:52:00.570 --> 01:52:03.290]  or they will not even germinate at all.
[01:52:03.290 --> 01:52:05.770]  There's a big difference between being soaked
[01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:08.010]  and being wet and being moist.
[01:52:08.010 --> 01:52:09.770]  We want to soak them in the beginning,
[01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:11.850]  put the seeds in there when they're soaked,
[01:52:11.850 --> 01:52:14.590]  then just keep it wet from there.
[01:52:14.590 --> 01:52:17.170]  You can usually tell by looking at the rapid rooters
[01:52:17.170 --> 01:52:18.490]  how dry or wet they are.
[01:52:18.490 --> 01:52:20.770]  When they start getting that brown crusty color,
[01:52:20.770 --> 01:52:21.650]  they're too dry.
[01:52:21.650 --> 01:52:23.130]  When they start getting that sheen to them,
[01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:24.610]  they start showing a little silver,
[01:52:24.610 --> 01:52:26.770]  a little light reflection, that's just right.
[01:52:26.770 --> 01:52:28.410]  When they're really, really black,
[01:52:28.410 --> 01:52:29.810]  that's when they are soaked.
[01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:33.770]  So learn how to identify soaked and saturated
[01:52:33.770 --> 01:52:36.790]  and wet and moist and create a little scale for yourself.
[01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:38.710]  I did the one through five watering technique.
[01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:41.150]  Maybe we need a similar thing for the rapid rooters.
[01:52:41.150 --> 01:52:42.330]  I kind of just did that.
[01:52:42.330 --> 01:52:44.730]  If they're totally soaked in black, that's a five.
[01:52:44.730 --> 01:52:46.350]  If they're dry and crispy, that's a one.
[01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:48.730]  We need to keep them about a three at all times,
[01:52:48.730 --> 01:52:49.570]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:49.570 --> 01:52:52.370]  So there we go, one through five tech on rapid rooters,
[01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:55.250]  just like we did on watering normal plants.
[01:52:55.250 --> 01:52:57.930]  So now we know how to germinate seeds in paper towels.
[01:52:57.930 --> 01:53:00.410]  We know how to germinate seeds in rapid rooters.
[01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:03.130]  We kind of know how to do it in rockwool cubes.
[01:53:03.130 --> 01:53:05.850]  We know how to germinate seeds in jiffy cubes.
[01:53:05.850 --> 01:53:08.670]  It is just like doing it in the rapid rooters, you guys.
[01:53:08.670 --> 01:53:10.150]  You moisten them, they expand,
[01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:12.330]  you squeeze the excess water out of there.
[01:53:12.330 --> 01:53:15.970]  Then you treat it just like a rapid rooter from there.
[01:53:15.970 --> 01:53:20.370]  Our next option is to plant our seedlings directly into soil.
[01:53:20.370 --> 01:53:21.810]  That's the way it happens in nature.
[01:53:21.810 --> 01:53:24.490]  Why wouldn't we do that in our personal garden?
[01:53:24.490 --> 01:53:26.930]  So let's talk a little bit about planting our seeds
[01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:30.890]  directly into soil or the medium we are going to use.
[01:53:30.890 --> 01:53:33.090]  If you plan to start your seedling in soil,
[01:53:33.090 --> 01:53:36.850]  I highly recommend you use a very small container.
[01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:40.850]  I would recommend a beer cup or something that size.
[01:53:40.850 --> 01:53:43.970]  There's no reason to have a tiny, tiny plant
[01:53:43.970 --> 01:53:46.130]  in a large container of soil.
[01:53:46.130 --> 01:53:48.890]  So my first recommendation is a small container
[01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:50.810]  with plenty of drainage.
[01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:53.890]  My second recommendation will be a good soil
[01:53:53.890 --> 01:53:57.390]  for starter plants, something with a lot of aeration
[01:53:57.390 --> 01:53:59.930]  and something with not too much nutrients added to it.
[01:53:59.930 --> 01:54:01.790]  Maybe something with some mycos
[01:54:01.790 --> 01:54:03.850]  or maybe some beneficial bacteria.
[01:54:03.850 --> 01:54:06.550]  That's good, but we don't need a lot of boosts
[01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:07.970]  for our little babies.
[01:54:07.970 --> 01:54:12.690]  So start with a small container of high quality starter soil.
[01:54:12.690 --> 01:54:15.890]  So I've got my container and I've got my starter soil.
[01:54:15.890 --> 01:54:19.690]  Now I moisten that soil before I put my seedlings into there.
[01:54:19.690 --> 01:54:23.970]  Just simply water that soil with a pH adjusted solution.
[01:54:23.970 --> 01:54:27.490]  You don't need nutrients, just water pH around six to six,
[01:54:27.490 --> 01:54:28.970]  three, you should be just fine.
[01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:31.490]  Just water it on in, let it drain out.
[01:54:31.490 --> 01:54:34.250]  Once it's done draining, take your pointer finger
[01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:36.910]  and just make a little tiny hole, just knuckle deep.
[01:54:36.910 --> 01:54:38.730]  Just like I keep saying in the episode,
[01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:40.210]  I may name the episode that.
[01:54:40.210 --> 01:54:42.830]  Just go about one knuckle deep into the soil,
[01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:45.230]  then take your seedling and just set it right inside
[01:54:45.230 --> 01:54:48.170]  that hole, then gently press the dirt right over
[01:54:48.170 --> 01:54:49.490]  that ceiling, just real gently.
[01:54:50.170 --> 01:54:52.130]  You don't need to pack it down, just cover up that seedling
[01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:53.370]  and then just let it rest.
[01:54:53.370 --> 01:54:58.330]  And then within 24 to 48 to 36, maybe 72 hours,
[01:54:58.330 --> 01:55:00.770]  you should see a little baby plant just popping up
[01:55:00.770 --> 01:55:01.610]  right out of there.
[01:55:01.610 --> 01:55:03.610]  You'll just see two little green leaves just popping
[01:55:03.610 --> 01:55:05.810]  right up out of that top soil.
[01:55:05.810 --> 01:55:08.210]  I like to keep my little baby plants in the beer cups
[01:55:08.210 --> 01:55:09.450]  under a T5 light.
[01:55:09.450 --> 01:55:12.010]  I try to keep the light kind of far when they're little.
[01:55:12.010 --> 01:55:12.930]  And then as they get bigger,
[01:55:12.930 --> 01:55:14.670]  I move the light a little bit closer.
[01:55:14.670 --> 01:55:16.970]  I try not to let the seedlings get too stretchy.
[01:55:16.970 --> 01:55:18.370]  If they start getting a little leggy,
[01:55:18.370 --> 01:55:19.770]  I move the light closer.
[01:55:19.770 --> 01:55:21.490]  I like to put a fan on them while they're little,
[01:55:21.490 --> 01:55:22.610]  that gives them a little strength,
[01:55:22.610 --> 01:55:24.370]  makes them a little more robust.
[01:55:24.370 --> 01:55:26.730]  So there are advantages and disadvantages
[01:55:26.730 --> 01:55:29.170]  to starting them in the beer cup.
[01:55:29.170 --> 01:55:32.010]  The advantage, they're already in their soil.
[01:55:32.010 --> 01:55:33.170]  You don't have to up-pot them,
[01:55:33.170 --> 01:55:34.450]  you don't have to transplant them,
[01:55:34.450 --> 01:55:37.210]  you don't have to do any damage to a little seedling.
[01:55:37.210 --> 01:55:40.370]  The disadvantage is sometimes you just completely
[01:55:40.370 --> 01:55:42.970]  lose a seedling in a beer cup filled with soil.
[01:55:42.970 --> 01:55:44.730]  Sometimes they just totally disappear.
[01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:46.830]  Sometimes they don't sprout at all.
[01:55:46.830 --> 01:55:48.670]  And sometimes you totally drown them
[01:55:48.670 --> 01:55:51.030]  by trying to water so much soil.
[01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:54.270]  So starting them in beer cups in soil is a little trickier,
[01:55:54.270 --> 01:55:56.950]  but it may be the only option for some people.
[01:55:56.950 --> 01:55:59.410]  Not everybody is able to order Rapid Rooters
[01:55:59.410 --> 01:56:00.750]  or Root Riot Cubes.
[01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:03.750]  Not everybody has access to a Rockwool Cube.
[01:56:03.750 --> 01:56:05.410]  And some people may just want to try it
[01:56:05.410 --> 01:56:08.170]  because that's the way it happens in nature.
[01:56:08.170 --> 01:56:10.510]  So that is a rundown of my basic methods
[01:56:10.510 --> 01:56:11.950]  of germinating seeds.
[01:56:11.950 --> 01:56:14.110]  Hopefully one of those methods works for you.
[01:56:14.110 --> 01:56:17.750]  Honestly, I use the folded paper towel method the most.
[01:56:17.750 --> 01:56:19.030]  In a commercial environment,
[01:56:19.030 --> 01:56:21.550]  I may use the Rapid Rooter method next,
[01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:24.830]  but I honestly do not start seeds directly in soil anymore.
[01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:27.710]  I found that I can start a lot more in much less space
[01:56:27.710 --> 01:56:29.310]  by using the Rapid Rooters.
[01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:30.770]  Imagine the amount of space it takes
[01:56:30.770 --> 01:56:34.910]  to start 100 Rapid Rooters compared to 100 beer cups.
[01:56:34.910 --> 01:56:38.310]  It's a large difference in the amount of space that you need.
[01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:40.990]  I honestly don't have any experience with the Jiffy Cubes.
[01:56:40.990 --> 01:56:42.190]  I've never had to use those.
[01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:44.550]  I've always had access to the Rapid Rooters.
[01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:45.950]  And honestly, I've just been sticking
[01:56:45.950 --> 01:56:47.390]  with the paper towel method.
[01:56:47.390 --> 01:56:49.550]  So that's what I'm doing the most.
[01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:52.070]  I encourage you to use the method
[01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:53.910]  that works the best for you.
[01:56:53.910 --> 01:56:56.670]  I encourage you also to try different methods.
[01:56:56.670 --> 01:56:58.270]  If you think something works great,
[01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:59.550]  why not try another method?
[01:56:59.550 --> 01:57:01.530]  If you've got some seeds that you can spare,
[01:57:01.530 --> 01:57:02.870]  why not try something?
[01:57:02.870 --> 01:57:06.150]  You may find that something works better for you.
[01:57:06.150 --> 01:57:08.550]  All right, so now we've got our seeds germinated.
[01:57:08.550 --> 01:57:11.130]  We've either got some seeds folded into a paper towel,
[01:57:11.130 --> 01:57:13.930]  or we've got a Rapid Rooter, or a Root Riot,
[01:57:13.930 --> 01:57:16.170]  or a Rockwool Cube with roots hanging out
[01:57:16.170 --> 01:57:17.670]  of the bottom of the Root Cube.
[01:57:17.670 --> 01:57:20.290]  Our next step is to pot our new seedling
[01:57:20.290 --> 01:57:24.110]  into a pot of soil or soilless mix.
[01:57:25.050 --> 01:57:28.970]  In this episode, I will cover how to pot the seeds
[01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:33.050]  germinated from a paper towel into soil.
[01:57:33.050 --> 01:57:36.770]  But my next episode is going to be about cutting clones.
[01:57:36.770 --> 01:57:38.250]  Then shortly after that,
[01:57:38.250 --> 01:57:41.170]  we will have to pot the clones into soil,
[01:57:41.170 --> 01:57:43.770]  which means I'm going to do a combo episode
[01:57:43.770 --> 01:57:46.970]  of planting our new seedlings in the Rapid Rooters
[01:57:46.970 --> 01:57:49.550]  and planting clones in Rapid Rooters
[01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:51.410]  into soil at the same time.
[01:57:51.410 --> 01:57:53.550]  I'm just gonna knock that out in one episode,
[01:57:53.550 --> 01:57:55.730]  so that part will be coming soon.
[01:57:55.730 --> 01:57:58.250]  But for now, let's talk about planting
[01:57:58.250 --> 01:58:00.210]  our freshly germinated seedlings
[01:58:00.210 --> 01:58:02.690]  that are just sitting in a wet paper towel.
[01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:04.010]  I like to catch these seeds
[01:58:04.010 --> 01:58:06.090]  when the new tap roots are very short.
[01:58:06.090 --> 01:58:07.450]  I don't like to get it too long
[01:58:07.450 --> 01:58:08.810]  and too out of control,
[01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:11.570]  because I feel like that gives me too much opportunity
[01:58:11.570 --> 01:58:13.490]  to cause it too much stress.
[01:58:13.490 --> 01:58:16.490]  So as soon as I see my seedlings crack open a little bit
[01:58:16.490 --> 01:58:17.970]  and that little tap root is sticking out
[01:58:17.970 --> 01:58:19.270]  just a little tiny bit,
[01:58:19.270 --> 01:58:22.010]  I'm comfortable putting them into their soil
[01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:23.650]  or soilless mix.
[01:58:23.650 --> 01:58:26.090]  And I do that with a very similar method
[01:58:26.090 --> 01:58:28.890]  as I did earlier when we talked about planting seeds
[01:58:28.890 --> 01:58:30.510]  into the beer cups.
[01:58:30.510 --> 01:58:33.070]  I get a beer cup or a very small pot
[01:58:33.070 --> 01:58:34.570]  with plenty of drainage.
[01:58:34.570 --> 01:58:36.610]  I fill it with a quality soil
[01:58:36.610 --> 01:58:38.210]  that is good for small plants,
[01:58:38.210 --> 01:58:41.330]  something with a lot of aeration and plenty of drainage.
[01:58:41.330 --> 01:58:43.370]  Then I moisten that soil with water
[01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:45.930]  pH around six to six three.
[01:58:45.930 --> 01:58:47.290]  Then I do the same thing
[01:58:47.290 --> 01:58:48.730]  as we've been doing the whole episode.
[01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:52.470]  I make a little tiny hole about knuckle deep in that soil.
[01:58:52.470 --> 01:58:57.470]  Then I simply place the germinated seed in that little hole.
[01:58:57.490 --> 01:58:59.330]  I do my best to point it
[01:58:59.330 --> 01:59:02.050]  with that little white root pointing straight down.
[01:59:02.050 --> 01:59:04.010]  If your tap root is nice and short,
[01:59:04.010 --> 01:59:05.610]  don't worry about which direction
[01:59:05.610 --> 01:59:08.250]  your seedling is facing when you place it into soil.
[01:59:08.250 --> 01:59:09.450]  It should be just fine.
[01:59:09.450 --> 01:59:10.770]  If it's really long,
[01:59:10.770 --> 01:59:13.170]  you may wanna make sure you point that root down
[01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:14.730]  and the seed is going up.
[01:59:14.730 --> 01:59:17.570]  So gently place your seedling in the soil,
[01:59:17.570 --> 01:59:19.010]  brush dirt over the top of it.
[01:59:19.010 --> 01:59:21.630]  You don't need to bury it or pack it down, just cover it.
[01:59:21.630 --> 01:59:23.490]  And then the tap root will go down.
[01:59:23.490 --> 01:59:24.870]  It'll start to spread out
[01:59:24.870 --> 01:59:27.330]  and the little tiny plant will grow up to the top
[01:59:27.330 --> 01:59:28.930]  and it'll push the seedling
[01:59:28.930 --> 01:59:30.910]  with a little set of tiny, tiny leaves
[01:59:30.910 --> 01:59:32.050]  right through the top soil
[01:59:32.050 --> 01:59:34.970]  and you'll have a little starter baby plant.
[01:59:34.970 --> 01:59:36.210]  The main thing to worry about
[01:59:36.210 --> 01:59:37.570]  when potting your new seedlings
[01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:40.850]  is to not damage that little white tap root
[01:59:40.850 --> 01:59:42.330]  sticking out of the seedling.
[01:59:42.330 --> 01:59:44.750]  Do your best not to disrupt, stress,
[01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:47.310]  or damage that little white tap root.
[01:59:47.310 --> 01:59:48.830]  They're very delicate.
[01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:50.130]  So once I've got it potted,
[01:59:50.130 --> 01:59:51.570]  I put it under a T5 light.
[01:59:51.570 --> 01:59:53.290]  I keep the light a little distance away
[01:59:53.290 --> 01:59:55.090]  so that I don't shock the plant.
[01:59:55.090 --> 01:59:56.250]  As the plant gets bigger,
[01:59:56.250 --> 01:59:57.930]  I bring the light a little bit closer.
[01:59:57.930 --> 01:59:59.930]  Once I feel like the plant has kind of taken off,
[01:59:59.930 --> 02:00:01.310]  I put a fan on it.
[02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:04.390]  And then once it gets its first set of serrated leaves,
[02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:08.870]  I start adding very light doses of nutrients.
[02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:11.350]  So that is how I pot my seedling
[02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:13.390]  that was germinated from a paper towel.
[02:00:13.390 --> 02:00:16.050]  I basically fill a beer cup with good dirt,
[02:00:16.050 --> 02:00:17.710]  poke a hole in the bottom,
[02:00:17.710 --> 02:00:20.030]  go knuckle deep in the soil on the top,
[02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:22.170]  drop my little germinated seedling in there
[02:00:22.170 --> 02:00:23.270]  and cover it up
[02:00:23.270 --> 02:00:24.470]  and then put it under the light
[02:00:24.470 --> 02:00:26.110]  and wait for it to pop up.
[02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:27.630]  And then it grows and grows
[02:00:27.630 --> 02:00:30.430]  until I see a set of leaves with serration
[02:00:30.430 --> 02:00:32.070]  and that is when I start feeding it
[02:00:32.070 --> 02:00:34.590]  a little bit of light nutrients.
[02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:36.390]  Now let's talk about a couple of things
[02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:40.390]  that happen quite often when we are working with seeds.
[02:00:40.390 --> 02:00:44.310]  Sometimes the seed shell will get stuck to the seed
[02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:45.830]  and hinder the seed's growth
[02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:47.790]  and threaten that seed's life.
[02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:50.230]  That is not as scary as it looks.
[02:00:50.230 --> 02:00:51.950]  When it happens, you'll know what I'm talking about.
[02:00:51.950 --> 02:00:54.030]  That seed hole will just get stuck.
[02:00:54.030 --> 02:00:56.230]  The seedling will come up out of the dirt
[02:00:56.230 --> 02:00:57.550]  and you'll see that seed,
[02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:58.910]  the leaves are trying to open up,
[02:00:58.910 --> 02:01:00.870]  it's trying to live and it's just trying to open up,
[02:01:00.870 --> 02:01:03.950]  but it can't because that seed casing is just stuck to it.
[02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:05.630]  It is really easy to solve.
[02:01:05.630 --> 02:01:08.150]  I get a spray bottle with water
[02:01:08.150 --> 02:01:10.510]  and I moisten that seedling really heavily.
[02:01:10.510 --> 02:01:11.550]  Just spray it with water.
[02:01:11.550 --> 02:01:12.630]  Just keep spraying it.
[02:01:12.630 --> 02:01:14.910]  More moisture, more moisture, more moisture.
[02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:17.630]  Then see if you can just brush it off with your finger.
[02:01:17.630 --> 02:01:18.990]  It may just come right off.
[02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:21.230]  If not, spray more water.
[02:01:21.230 --> 02:01:22.590]  If that still doesn't work,
[02:01:22.590 --> 02:01:25.470]  get some tweezers and just do a gentle dissection.
[02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:26.790]  If it is really moist,
[02:01:26.790 --> 02:01:28.990]  you should be able to get that seed casing off.
[02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:30.830]  It is supposed to come off of there.
[02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:32.590]  That plant opens up.
[02:01:32.590 --> 02:01:34.230]  The way the plant opens itself up,
[02:01:34.230 --> 02:01:36.110]  the way that that seed casing spreads in half,
[02:01:36.110 --> 02:01:37.790]  it should pop right off of there.
[02:01:37.790 --> 02:01:39.470]  Just give it a little assistance,
[02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:41.390]  a little moisture, little tweezers,
[02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:42.510]  maybe a pair of chopsticks,
[02:01:42.510 --> 02:01:44.070]  depending on how skilled you are.
[02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:45.550]  It shouldn't be too hard to do.
[02:01:45.550 --> 02:01:48.950]  Don't be afraid to get in there and pull that casing off.
[02:01:48.950 --> 02:01:51.350]  Earlier, I talked about not using heat mats.
[02:01:51.350 --> 02:01:55.390]  I've honestly seen people roast more seeds with heat mats
[02:01:55.390 --> 02:01:57.150]  than I've ever seen success
[02:01:57.150 --> 02:01:59.110]  with a heat mat from a seedling.
[02:01:59.110 --> 02:02:01.750]  The only time I have ever needed a heat mat
[02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:04.790]  was when I was growing in a warehouse in Colorado
[02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:07.150]  and it was really cold during the winter.
[02:02:07.150 --> 02:02:09.710]  Other times, I don't use a heat mat for cloning
[02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:12.870]  or for seedlings, and I have great success.
[02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:14.790]  If you are comfortable in the area,
[02:02:14.790 --> 02:02:18.110]  your seedlings are probably comfortable in that area also.
[02:02:18.110 --> 02:02:20.870]  And I'm not talking about some Colorado mountain boy
[02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:22.190]  who's outside barefoot in the snow.
[02:02:22.190 --> 02:02:23.590]  I'm talking about a normal person.
[02:02:23.590 --> 02:02:27.310]  Room temperature is acceptable for your seedlings.
[02:02:27.310 --> 02:02:28.990]  Now, I've got one more thing I want to touch on
[02:02:28.990 --> 02:02:30.950]  before I start wrapping up the episode,
[02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:33.550]  and the note I wrote is called pre-soak.
[02:02:33.550 --> 02:02:36.870]  A lot of people like to pre-soak their seeds
[02:02:36.870 --> 02:02:38.910]  before the official germination.
[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:40.230]  If you have got older seeds
[02:02:40.230 --> 02:02:41.950]  that have been sitting around for longer,
[02:02:41.950 --> 02:02:45.070]  I may recommend you give them a pre-soak.
[02:02:45.070 --> 02:02:46.150]  It's really easy.
[02:02:46.150 --> 02:02:49.870]  You simply pre-soak them in water before you germinate them.
[02:02:49.870 --> 02:02:52.950]  I recommend 12 hours, maybe 24 at the most.
[02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:55.510]  Never go more than 24 hours on a soak
[02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:57.950]  because that will drown your seeds.
[02:02:57.950 --> 02:03:00.630]  My theory behind the pre-soak is some seeds
[02:03:00.630 --> 02:03:02.390]  just have a hard outer coating
[02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:04.830]  and they don't want to germinate very easily.
[02:03:04.830 --> 02:03:07.150]  Soaking them in water for 24 hours
[02:03:07.150 --> 02:03:09.510]  will definitely soften that outer coating
[02:03:09.510 --> 02:03:11.830]  and encourage easier germination.
[02:03:11.830 --> 02:03:13.070]  So if you've got older seeds
[02:03:13.070 --> 02:03:15.590]  that you've been having a problem getting to germinate,
[02:03:15.590 --> 02:03:17.430]  maybe soak them for 12 hours,
[02:03:17.430 --> 02:03:19.270]  then give them the paper towel method.
[02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:22.510]  If that doesn't work, try soaking some for 24 hours,
[02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:24.310]  then giving them the paper towel method.
[02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:25.430]  If that doesn't work,
[02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:28.590]  then we're going to need to try more scientific approaches.
[02:03:28.590 --> 02:03:30.110]  There are chemicals we can add.
[02:03:30.110 --> 02:03:31.350]  There are tricks we can do,
[02:03:31.350 --> 02:03:33.910]  but that is much more advanced science
[02:03:33.910 --> 02:03:36.070]  than what we're prepared for today.
[02:03:36.070 --> 02:03:37.190]  So if you've got old seeds
[02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:39.070]  or if you feel like you've got really hard seeds
[02:03:39.070 --> 02:03:40.470]  with a really thick coating,
[02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:42.750]  don't be afraid to give them a pre-soak.
[02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:45.670]  12 to 24 hours, never go more than 24 hours.
[02:03:45.670 --> 02:03:47.910]  I don't feel like that's a good idea.
[02:03:47.910 --> 02:03:49.830]  All right, you guys, I feel like that is a good lesson
[02:03:49.830 --> 02:03:52.030]  on how to germinate your seeds.
[02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:54.430]  I will not forget to teach you guys how to pot
[02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:56.310]  those freshly sprouted seeds
[02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:58.110]  that you've got in your Rapid Rooters
[02:03:58.110 --> 02:04:01.030]  or your Rockwool Cubes, like I told you not to do,
[02:04:01.030 --> 02:04:02.070]  or in your Jiffy Pots.
[02:04:02.070 --> 02:04:04.430]  We'll talk about that in a future episode.
[02:04:04.430 --> 02:04:05.590]  That is written down.
[02:04:05.590 --> 02:04:07.150]  That is on the schedule.
[02:04:07.150 --> 02:04:07.990]  You guys, I want to thank you
[02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:09.950]  for listening to another episode.
[02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:10.910]  I want to encourage you guys

[02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:36.010]  I think you could tell my throat is burning out.
[02:05:36.010 --> 02:05:39.250]  I'll be back in just a few days with fresh new content.
[02:05:39.250 --> 02:05:40.670]  Thank you guys for listening.
[02:05:40.670 --> 02:05:43.350]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Indica Doggo,
[02:05:43.350 --> 02:05:44.270]  and until next time,
[02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:47.190]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:05:48.870 --> 02:05:50.110]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[02:05:50.110 --> 02:05:52.070]  It's time for episode 364
[02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:54.470]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:56.550]  This episode of the show is brought to you
[02:05:56.550 --> 02:05:59.270]  by our friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:05:59.270 --> 02:06:01.430]  If you need new seeds for your garden,
[02:06:01.430 --> 02:06:04.250]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[02:06:04.250 --> 02:06:08.510]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[02:06:08.510 --> 02:06:09.590]  I like to start the show off
[02:06:09.590 --> 02:06:11.350]  by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:06:11.350 --> 02:06:14.350]  I just took a gigantic dab of Stardog Ambrosia
[02:06:14.350 --> 02:06:16.030]  from Apothecary Farms.
[02:06:16.030 --> 02:06:18.210]  I always love the flavor of the Stardog.
[02:06:18.210 --> 02:06:20.150]  I love the effect of the Stardog,
[02:06:20.150 --> 02:06:22.570]  and the folks at Apothecary always get it right.
[02:06:22.570 --> 02:06:24.550]  So big shout out to Apothecary Farms
[02:06:24.550 --> 02:06:27.510]  and the Stardog Ambrosia extracts.
[02:06:27.510 --> 02:06:29.730]  All right, you guys, this is going to be another grow lesson
[02:06:29.730 --> 02:06:31.150]  if you've been following along.
[02:06:31.150 --> 02:06:33.550]  I've been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[02:06:33.550 --> 02:06:36.230]  In this lesson, we're going to talk about cutting clones.
[02:06:36.230 --> 02:06:38.470]  We're going to cut clones into rapid rooters.
[02:06:38.470 --> 02:06:41.470]  We will cut clones for use in an easy cloning machine,
[02:06:41.470 --> 02:06:44.270]  and we will also talk briefly about cutting clones
[02:06:44.270 --> 02:06:46.510]  directly into cups of soil.
[02:06:46.510 --> 02:06:48.750]  I feel like I have a lot of detailed information
[02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:50.850]  written down, so let's not waste a lot of time
[02:06:50.850 --> 02:06:51.830]  with a long intro.
[02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:53.670]  Let's get right into a grow lesson.
[02:06:53.670 --> 02:06:55.910]  Let's talk about cutting clones.
[02:06:55.910 --> 02:06:58.610]  I think a good spot to start talking about cutting clones
[02:06:58.610 --> 02:07:00.630]  is beginning with healthy mother plants.
[02:07:00.630 --> 02:07:03.950]  You need a healthy donor plant to have a healthy clone.
[02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:06.670]  I suggest you listen to episode 315
[02:07:06.670 --> 02:07:08.950]  and learn all about healthy mother plants.
[02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:10.710]  So if you've listened to episode 315,
[02:07:10.710 --> 02:07:12.150]  or if you feel like you are up to speed
[02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:14.830]  and you have healthy veg plants or healthy mother plants,
[02:07:14.830 --> 02:07:17.870]  let's get into a lesson on cutting clones.
[02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:20.270]  Let's talk briefly about why we take clones.
[02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:23.290]  Why do I want to cut a clone from a healthy plant?
[02:07:23.290 --> 02:07:24.950]  That is a really good question.
[02:07:24.950 --> 02:07:27.270]  First off, I suggest you cut a clone
[02:07:27.270 --> 02:07:29.270]  from every new plant you grow.
[02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:30.090]  Have a clone.
[02:07:30.090 --> 02:07:32.070]  If you've got the opportunity to cut a clone
[02:07:32.070 --> 02:07:33.830]  and keep a clone in another veg space,
[02:07:33.830 --> 02:07:35.410]  I always recommend that.
[02:07:35.410 --> 02:07:36.970]  You may get a pack of seeds.
[02:07:36.970 --> 02:07:38.230]  You may grow that pack of seeds
[02:07:38.230 --> 02:07:40.970]  and find the most amazing plant in that pack of seeds.
[02:07:40.970 --> 02:07:42.850]  And if you did not take a clone, guess what?
[02:07:42.850 --> 02:07:43.690]  It's gone.
[02:07:43.690 --> 02:07:44.870]  You can't grow that again.
[02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:46.770]  The advantage to cutting clones
[02:07:46.770 --> 02:07:49.530]  is if you do find a keeper in a pack of seeds,
[02:07:49.530 --> 02:07:52.210]  you can grow that same keeper over and over again
[02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:53.310]  if you have taken a clone.
[02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:55.070]  You have reliable, tested genetics.
[02:07:55.070 --> 02:07:56.210]  You know it's a female.
[02:07:56.210 --> 02:07:57.050]  You know it's potent.
[02:07:57.050 --> 02:07:57.890]  You know it tastes good.
[02:07:57.890 --> 02:08:00.370]  And you know it grows the way you want it to grow.
[02:08:00.370 --> 02:08:02.370]  So that's the main point of taking a clone
[02:08:02.370 --> 02:08:03.850]  from any type of plant.
[02:08:03.850 --> 02:08:05.450]  You are getting a reproduction
[02:08:05.450 --> 02:08:07.850]  of the plant you are familiar with.
[02:08:07.850 --> 02:08:09.050]  So we take a clone.
[02:08:09.050 --> 02:08:10.610]  Then you can either grow out that clone
[02:08:10.610 --> 02:08:12.830]  or you can create a mother plant from that clone
[02:08:12.830 --> 02:08:14.890]  and take multiple clones from that plant
[02:08:14.890 --> 02:08:16.930]  and fill your grow room or rooms
[02:08:16.930 --> 02:08:19.770]  with that same cultivar over and over again
[02:08:19.770 --> 02:08:23.810]  and have repeatable, reliable results with that clone.
[02:08:23.810 --> 02:08:25.650]  Seeds do show variation.
[02:08:25.650 --> 02:08:27.610]  We try to narrow down the variation
[02:08:27.610 --> 02:08:30.670]  in seeds through breeding, but that does take time.
[02:08:30.670 --> 02:08:32.130]  If you're growing from clones,
[02:08:32.130 --> 02:08:34.250]  you know you are going to have exact copies.
[02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:36.570]  If you take 100 clones off of one plant
[02:08:36.570 --> 02:08:37.890]  and you put those all in a grow room,
[02:08:37.890 --> 02:08:40.090]  they are all going to act exactly the same.
[02:08:40.090 --> 02:08:41.970]  You shouldn't see any variation in there.
[02:08:41.970 --> 02:08:43.730]  So that is the point and the purpose
[02:08:43.730 --> 02:08:46.010]  and the advantage of growing with clones
[02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:48.810]  and why we want to learn how to take clones.
[02:08:48.810 --> 02:08:50.210]  Now, I know somebody out there listening
[02:08:50.210 --> 02:08:53.110]  is going to bring up the subject of genetic drift.
[02:08:53.110 --> 02:08:55.810]  I suggest you take a listen to episode 343
[02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:57.210]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast
[02:08:57.210 --> 02:09:01.010]  and you will hear my full opinion of genetic drift.
[02:09:01.010 --> 02:09:04.250]  In this episode, I'm going to cover three common methods
[02:09:04.250 --> 02:09:06.010]  for cutting clones.
[02:09:06.010 --> 02:09:07.870]  In all three of those methods,
[02:09:07.870 --> 02:09:10.270]  one of the most important things we can think about
[02:09:10.270 --> 02:09:14.150]  is cleanliness of the plants and cleanliness of our tools
[02:09:14.150 --> 02:09:16.390]  and cleanliness of our environment.
[02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:19.230]  Cleanliness is very important when cutting clones.
[02:09:19.230 --> 02:09:20.370]  Think of it this way.
[02:09:20.370 --> 02:09:21.870]  We are taking a plant.
[02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:23.610]  We are taking something sharp.
[02:09:23.610 --> 02:09:25.130]  We are cutting that plant.
[02:09:25.130 --> 02:09:27.650]  We are severing a limb from our plant.
[02:09:27.650 --> 02:09:30.910]  Hopefully the tool we used was clean and sanitized.
[02:09:31.610 --> 02:09:34.370]  Hopefully that plant was pest and pathogen free.
[02:09:34.370 --> 02:09:36.170]  Hopefully you were wearing gloves.
[02:09:36.170 --> 02:09:38.050]  So we have just made a fresh cut in a plant.
[02:09:38.050 --> 02:09:39.690]  We've got a plant with a cut in it.
[02:09:39.690 --> 02:09:41.470]  We've got a fresh cut with an open wound
[02:09:41.470 --> 02:09:42.470]  at the bottom of it.
[02:09:42.470 --> 02:09:45.210]  We have a lot of opportunity for infection or pathogen
[02:09:45.210 --> 02:09:46.870]  to enter this plant at this point.
[02:09:46.870 --> 02:09:48.550]  Keep your environment clean.
[02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:51.830]  Now, everywhere you set that clone needs to be clean.
[02:09:51.830 --> 02:09:53.770]  The product you dip that clone into
[02:09:53.770 --> 02:09:56.130]  needs to be clean and contaminant free.
[02:09:56.130 --> 02:09:57.890]  So when you're pouring out your dipping gel,
[02:09:57.890 --> 02:10:00.210]  your CloneX gel or whatever you choose to use,
[02:10:00.230 --> 02:10:02.470]  don't dip your clones directly into the container.
[02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:04.790]  Pour out about a shot glass worth at a time
[02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:07.110]  and dip your fresh cuts into there before you stick them.
[02:10:07.110 --> 02:10:08.550]  That is my recommendation
[02:10:08.550 --> 02:10:10.970]  to keep some sanitation going through the grow.
[02:10:10.970 --> 02:10:12.270]  So every step of cloning,
[02:10:12.270 --> 02:10:13.790]  we need to think about cleanliness.
[02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:15.510]  Cleanliness is very important.
[02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:17.990]  Clean out your cloning trays before you use them.
[02:10:17.990 --> 02:10:20.230]  Clean your cloner before you use it.
[02:10:20.230 --> 02:10:21.350]  Clean your clone plugs.
[02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:22.470]  Even if you just bought them,
[02:10:22.470 --> 02:10:23.310]  rinse them off.
[02:10:23.310 --> 02:10:25.630]  Those neoprene collars, give them a nice rinse.
[02:10:25.630 --> 02:10:28.350]  If you're using permaclone collars, clean them.
[02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:29.170]  They're reusable.
[02:10:29.190 --> 02:10:30.470]  What you've got to do is sanitize them.
[02:10:30.470 --> 02:10:31.310]  It is very easy.
[02:10:31.310 --> 02:10:33.590]  They came with instructions on how to clean them.
[02:10:33.590 --> 02:10:34.910]  Follow those instructions
[02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:38.190]  and you can use those over and over again with no problems.
[02:10:38.190 --> 02:10:41.150]  Clean every part of the cloning process.
[02:10:41.150 --> 02:10:42.770]  Think about it this way.
[02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:46.270]  We are basically performing major surgery
[02:10:46.270 --> 02:10:48.270]  on our cannabis plants.
[02:10:48.270 --> 02:10:50.230]  Would you want to be in that environment
[02:10:50.230 --> 02:10:51.490]  with your arm severed?
[02:10:51.490 --> 02:10:53.670]  Would you trust me in your clone room to say,
[02:10:53.670 --> 02:10:54.510]  I got it bro,
[02:10:54.510 --> 02:10:57.070]  and grab whatever scissors you use to cut the clone,
[02:10:57.070 --> 02:10:59.450]  I'm going to cut your arm off with that.
[02:10:59.450 --> 02:11:00.290]  Okay?
[02:11:00.290 --> 02:11:01.450]  Then I'm going to set your arm,
[02:11:01.450 --> 02:11:03.730]  wherever you put the clones after you chop them,
[02:11:03.730 --> 02:11:04.690]  you cut a bunch of clones
[02:11:04.690 --> 02:11:05.650]  and then you set them down somewhere
[02:11:05.650 --> 02:11:07.250]  until you get a chance to dip them and stick them
[02:11:07.250 --> 02:11:08.610]  because they can't all go at once.
[02:11:08.610 --> 02:11:09.970]  Wherever you set those clones,
[02:11:09.970 --> 02:11:11.730]  I want to set your severed arm.
[02:11:11.730 --> 02:11:12.630]  How do you feel about that?
[02:11:12.630 --> 02:11:13.610]  Are you okay with that?
[02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:14.850]  Is it that clean?
[02:11:14.850 --> 02:11:17.310]  Then I want to dip your severed arm into some clone gel.
[02:11:17.310 --> 02:11:18.250]  We're not going to clone your arm.
[02:11:18.250 --> 02:11:19.090]  We're going to stop there,
[02:11:19.090 --> 02:11:20.650]  but I want your mind to think about
[02:11:20.650 --> 02:11:22.250]  that level of cleanliness.
[02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:24.050]  Also, are you comfortable running around
[02:11:24.050 --> 02:11:26.090]  with that severed arm in that grow environment?
[02:11:26.090 --> 02:11:27.210]  Is it clean enough?
[02:11:27.210 --> 02:11:28.310]  Or are you looking around going,
[02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:31.610]  I'm going to get some dirty shit in this stump.
[02:11:31.610 --> 02:11:33.710]  Think about that in your cloning environment.
[02:11:33.710 --> 02:11:34.550]  Clean it up.
[02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:35.770]  It doesn't take that long.
[02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:36.610]  Get a broom,
[02:11:36.610 --> 02:11:37.450]  get a mop,
[02:11:37.450 --> 02:11:38.670]  clean some shit up.
[02:11:38.670 --> 02:11:40.170]  The process of cutting clones
[02:11:40.170 --> 02:11:42.370]  will give your plants a lot of opportunity
[02:11:42.370 --> 02:11:43.490]  to pick up problems.
[02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:46.250]  This is where we see people pick up problems
[02:11:46.250 --> 02:11:49.630]  that they later try to identify as genetic drift.
[02:11:49.630 --> 02:11:50.530]  So wear gloves,
[02:11:50.530 --> 02:11:51.370]  clean your tools,
[02:11:51.370 --> 02:11:52.730]  clean all of your equipment,
[02:11:52.730 --> 02:11:54.490]  use fresh neoprenes.
[02:11:54.490 --> 02:11:56.530]  If you're not using Permaclone clone collars,
[02:11:56.530 --> 02:11:58.010]  you need to replace them every time.
[02:11:58.010 --> 02:11:59.730]  Don't try to reuse those cheapos.
[02:11:59.730 --> 02:12:01.090]  They have a lot of space in there
[02:12:01.090 --> 02:12:02.690]  where things can build up.
[02:12:02.690 --> 02:12:04.870]  The Permaclone collars are made out of a different product.
[02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:05.710]  You can clean them.
[02:12:05.710 --> 02:12:07.290]  Don't try to reuse the cheapos,
[02:12:07.290 --> 02:12:09.330]  please, you will get problems.
[02:12:09.330 --> 02:12:10.150]  Clean everything,
[02:12:10.150 --> 02:12:10.990]  that is my point.
[02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:13.730]  Let's move forward from talking about cleanliness.
[02:12:13.730 --> 02:12:18.650]  Let's talk about the actual procedure for cutting clones.
[02:12:18.650 --> 02:12:20.850]  The two methods I use most commonly
[02:12:20.850 --> 02:12:22.410]  in a commercial grow environment
[02:12:22.410 --> 02:12:24.290]  or in my own personal grows
[02:12:25.050 --> 02:12:25.970]  are cutting into rapid rooters
[02:12:25.970 --> 02:12:27.690]  or using EZ-Cloners
[02:12:27.690 --> 02:12:29.770]  or the Botanicare Turbo Cloner machines.
[02:12:29.770 --> 02:12:33.030]  When I talk about the EZ-Cloner or the Turbo Cloner,
[02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:35.390]  I will probably say EZ-Cloner all the time.
[02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:36.670]  I mean the same thing.
[02:12:36.670 --> 02:12:38.710]  They're both very similar machines.
[02:12:38.710 --> 02:12:42.530]  So let's talk about cutting clones first into rapid rooters.
[02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:44.350]  This is a very common method.
[02:12:44.350 --> 02:12:45.650]  It's very cost-effective
[02:12:45.650 --> 02:12:48.690]  and it does not require an expensive machine.
[02:12:48.690 --> 02:12:50.210]  So let's get right into it.
[02:12:50.210 --> 02:12:52.750]  Cutting clones in rapid rooters.
[02:12:52.750 --> 02:12:55.470]  Step one, soak the rapid rooter plugs
[02:12:55.470 --> 02:12:59.270]  in a weak but pH balanced nutrient solution.
[02:12:59.270 --> 02:13:01.090]  If you're using bottled nutrients,
[02:13:01.090 --> 02:13:03.270]  you can use your veg nutrients
[02:13:03.270 --> 02:13:06.250]  at about a quarter strength for your clones.
[02:13:06.250 --> 02:13:08.230]  So fill up a gallon container of water,
[02:13:08.230 --> 02:13:10.950]  pour in a quarter strength worth of nutrients
[02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:14.550]  and then adjust the pH between 5.8 and 6.0.
[02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:16.510]  Now I usually get the tray with the whole setup
[02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:18.910]  that's got the little spots for those plugs to go.
[02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:20.710]  So I've got a little spot to keep them stood up.
[02:13:20.710 --> 02:13:22.270]  If you don't wanna buy the whole tray,
[02:13:22.750 --> 02:13:24.270]  you don't have to do that many clones,
[02:13:24.270 --> 02:13:25.190]  but it's a lot easier.
[02:13:25.190 --> 02:13:27.110]  I find filling the whole tray
[02:13:27.110 --> 02:13:29.830]  keeps the moisture level easier to control
[02:13:29.830 --> 02:13:30.790]  inside of the dome.
[02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:32.610]  We'll talk about that in a little bit.
[02:13:32.610 --> 02:13:34.410]  So you soak your plugs,
[02:13:34.410 --> 02:13:36.350]  then you put all of those plugs in the tray.
[02:13:36.350 --> 02:13:38.270]  I put all 50 of them in the tray.
[02:13:38.270 --> 02:13:39.830]  Then once all 50 of them are in there,
[02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:42.950]  now it is time to go and cut our clones.
[02:13:42.950 --> 02:13:43.910]  I like to cut clones
[02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:46.190]  from a few different parts of the plant.
[02:13:46.190 --> 02:13:47.530]  When I'm topping my plants,
[02:13:47.530 --> 02:13:49.190]  I quite often make clones
[02:13:49.190 --> 02:13:51.630]  from that super healthy fat top of the plant.
[02:13:51.630 --> 02:13:53.670]  Those make beautiful clones.
[02:13:53.670 --> 02:13:55.070]  If I've already cut the top out,
[02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:57.510]  I also make clones from when I lollipop.
[02:13:57.510 --> 02:13:59.790]  When you go clean off the bottoms of the plants,
[02:13:59.790 --> 02:14:01.990]  I usually clean up the bottom six or eight,
[02:14:01.990 --> 02:14:03.070]  maybe 10 or 12 inches,
[02:14:03.070 --> 02:14:04.670]  depending on the size of the plant.
[02:14:04.670 --> 02:14:05.990]  Those bottom branches,
[02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:08.150]  those make beautiful clones.
[02:14:08.150 --> 02:14:10.590]  You can take your clone from any part of the plant
[02:14:10.590 --> 02:14:11.790]  as long as it is healthy
[02:14:11.790 --> 02:14:13.070]  and as long as you are happy
[02:14:13.070 --> 02:14:15.030]  with removing that section of the plant.
[02:14:15.030 --> 02:14:17.030]  Right before I flip my plants into flower,
[02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:18.570]  I do a major cleanup anyway.
[02:14:18.570 --> 02:14:19.990]  So that's a good opportunity
[02:14:19.990 --> 02:14:20.990]  for me to get clones
[02:14:20.990 --> 02:14:23.310]  off the bottom parts of those plants.
[02:14:23.310 --> 02:14:24.670]  So try to cut your clones
[02:14:24.670 --> 02:14:26.430]  from the healthiest part of the plant.
[02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:28.710]  Take about a five to eight inch cut
[02:14:28.710 --> 02:14:30.070]  off of your mother plant.
[02:14:30.070 --> 02:14:31.070]  And when you cut it,
[02:14:31.070 --> 02:14:33.670]  try to cut at a 45 degree angle.
[02:14:33.670 --> 02:14:34.550]  We're gonna talk a little bit
[02:14:34.550 --> 02:14:36.150]  about that 45 degree angle here
[02:14:36.150 --> 02:14:37.510]  in just a couple of minutes.
[02:14:37.510 --> 02:14:40.950]  Now, always, always clean your scissors, you guys.
[02:14:40.950 --> 02:14:42.990]  Clean your scissors with rubbing alcohol.
[02:14:42.990 --> 02:14:45.110]  And when you change mother plants,
[02:14:45.110 --> 02:14:47.350]  if you cut 20 clones off of this mother plant,
[02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:48.550]  and then you decide to cut clones
[02:14:48.550 --> 02:14:50.270]  off of another mother plant,
[02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:52.030]  clean your scissors between plants.
[02:14:52.030 --> 02:14:54.410]  Earlier, we talked about this being just like surgery.
[02:14:54.410 --> 02:14:56.630]  You wouldn't use the same scissors on different patients.
[02:14:56.630 --> 02:14:58.250]  You don't wanna spread disease.
[02:14:58.250 --> 02:14:59.550]  That's the exact same reason
[02:14:59.550 --> 02:15:03.750]  why we want to clean our scissors between mother plants.
[02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:04.890]  Now, when I'm cutting clones,
[02:15:04.890 --> 02:15:06.650]  I try to take a small cup
[02:15:06.650 --> 02:15:07.650]  with a little bit of water
[02:15:07.650 --> 02:15:09.230]  with nutrient solution in it.
[02:15:09.230 --> 02:15:11.590]  And I take as many cuttings as I need at one time
[02:15:11.590 --> 02:15:12.730]  and fill that cup
[02:15:12.730 --> 02:15:14.870]  and then take that cup back to my cloning station.
[02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:16.150]  I don't go cut a clone,
[02:15:16.150 --> 02:15:17.510]  then take that back to the station
[02:15:17.510 --> 02:15:18.470]  and then go cut another one
[02:15:19.350 --> 02:15:20.190]  and then take it back.
[02:15:20.190 --> 02:15:21.010]  I'll go get as many as I need.
[02:15:21.010 --> 02:15:23.950]  If I need 50, I'll go find 50 good clones of one strain.
[02:15:23.950 --> 02:15:25.510]  Then I head back to the clone station.
[02:15:25.510 --> 02:15:27.530]  I clean them up, I dip them, and I stick them.
[02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:28.730]  Then I can put the dome on
[02:15:28.730 --> 02:15:30.550]  and then I can leave them alone for a few days.
[02:15:30.550 --> 02:15:32.110]  I don't have to keep walking back and forth
[02:15:32.110 --> 02:15:33.190]  between each cut.
[02:15:33.190 --> 02:15:34.730]  I don't have to worry about the plants wilting
[02:15:34.730 --> 02:15:35.910]  because the dome isn't on.
[02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:37.750]  I don't have to keep taking the dome off and on
[02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:39.270]  trying to rescue plants.
[02:15:39.270 --> 02:15:41.550]  It's much more efficient and gentler on the plants
[02:15:41.550 --> 02:15:42.810]  to go take all of our cuts
[02:15:42.810 --> 02:15:44.330]  and then head back to the clone station
[02:15:44.330 --> 02:15:46.510]  and work on all of them at once.
[02:15:46.510 --> 02:15:48.870]  So I've taken all of my cuttings
[02:15:48.870 --> 02:15:50.830]  and I'm back at the clone station.
[02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:52.270]  Now I'm gonna take each cutting.
[02:15:52.270 --> 02:15:54.350]  It's about five to eight inches long,
[02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:55.810]  depending on the genetics
[02:15:55.810 --> 02:15:58.790]  and the stretchiness of that plant.
[02:15:58.790 --> 02:15:59.970]  On a five to eight inch cutting,
[02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:02.230]  you may have one or two little side nodes
[02:16:02.230 --> 02:16:03.070]  sticking off of it,
[02:16:03.070 --> 02:16:05.730]  but at the top, we've got that fresh new growth
[02:16:05.730 --> 02:16:07.150]  coming right out of the top.
[02:16:07.150 --> 02:16:09.310]  And then there are those two main leaves
[02:16:09.310 --> 02:16:11.350]  coming right out of the top of that branch.
[02:16:11.350 --> 02:16:14.690]  We basically want to remove everything from our clone
[02:16:14.690 --> 02:16:16.530]  other than those two top leaves
[02:16:16.530 --> 02:16:18.250]  and that new part sticking out of the top.
[02:16:18.250 --> 02:16:20.050]  We don't need much more than that.
[02:16:20.050 --> 02:16:22.450]  Less is more when it comes to taking clones
[02:16:22.450 --> 02:16:23.370]  in a rapid rooter.
[02:16:23.370 --> 02:16:25.470]  We don't need a lot of material to get started.
[02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:26.870]  Once you get more experienced at it,
[02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:27.910]  once you get better,
[02:16:27.910 --> 02:16:29.530]  you may be able to take larger clones,
[02:16:29.530 --> 02:16:32.550]  but smaller clones are easier in this type of setup.
[02:16:32.550 --> 02:16:34.930]  So all we really need is those top two leaves
[02:16:34.930 --> 02:16:37.110]  and that new fresh part coming right out of the top.
[02:16:37.110 --> 02:16:39.730]  There's nothing really there to sustain life in this clone.
[02:16:39.730 --> 02:16:41.530]  So we don't need to give it a lot of stuff
[02:16:41.530 --> 02:16:42.490]  to try to keep alive.
[02:16:42.490 --> 02:16:44.130]  We don't need to burden this plant
[02:16:44.490 --> 02:16:46.050]  by having a whole bunch of extra leaves
[02:16:46.050 --> 02:16:47.650]  and extra little side branches.
[02:16:47.650 --> 02:16:49.790]  So just those top two plus the new stuff coming out
[02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:50.630]  is all we need.
[02:16:50.630 --> 02:16:51.450]  Clean that all up.
[02:16:51.450 --> 02:16:53.970]  I generally cut those two top leaves.
[02:16:53.970 --> 02:16:55.670]  I trim them quite a bit.
[02:16:55.670 --> 02:16:56.650]  So think about it this way.
[02:16:56.650 --> 02:16:58.290]  The leaf is oval shaped.
[02:16:58.290 --> 02:16:59.770]  It starts off real skinny.
[02:16:59.770 --> 02:17:01.250]  It gets wider, it gets wider.
[02:17:01.250 --> 02:17:04.010]  And then at some point it starts to taper back in.
[02:17:04.010 --> 02:17:07.010]  Right where it tapers in is where I cut that leaf tip off.
[02:17:07.010 --> 02:17:09.070]  So right at the widest part of that leaf,
[02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:10.070]  I just cut it right off.
[02:17:10.070 --> 02:17:11.530]  So now I've got a little stalk
[02:17:11.530 --> 02:17:13.230]  with these two leaves that have been trimmed up
[02:17:13.230 --> 02:17:14.710]  and then just a little fresh part
[02:17:14.710 --> 02:17:16.030]  coming right out of the top of it.
[02:17:16.030 --> 02:17:17.270]  There's not a lot there,
[02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:19.830]  but that is much easier for us to sustain
[02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:22.150]  than a big plant in a clone dome.
[02:17:22.150 --> 02:17:23.430]  So now I've got this little stick
[02:17:23.430 --> 02:17:24.650]  with these trimmed up little leaves
[02:17:24.650 --> 02:17:26.550]  with this fresh growth coming out of the top.
[02:17:26.550 --> 02:17:28.030]  Now at the very bottom of that,
[02:17:28.030 --> 02:17:28.870]  when we cut it off,
[02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:30.850]  we should have cut at a 45 degree angle.
[02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:32.790]  If you didn't make a nice 45 degree angle
[02:17:32.790 --> 02:17:33.990]  when you originally cut it,
[02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:36.070]  go ahead and make the bottom of that stem
[02:17:36.070 --> 02:17:38.490]  a nice 45 degree angle.
[02:17:38.490 --> 02:17:40.990]  Now the next thing I do is use a razor blade
[02:17:40.990 --> 02:17:43.430]  to gently scrape the edge of my clone.
[02:17:43.430 --> 02:17:45.310]  Anything that's going to be submerged
[02:17:45.310 --> 02:17:46.750]  into the Rapid Rooter,
[02:17:46.750 --> 02:17:49.090]  I gently, very gently give it a scrape.
[02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:51.630]  I just want to take off that very top layer,
[02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:54.570]  just disrupt the very outside layer of that clone
[02:17:54.570 --> 02:17:56.150]  so that it will kind of break that skin
[02:17:56.150 --> 02:17:58.650]  and give it an opportunity to root a little more.
[02:17:58.650 --> 02:18:01.670]  So I give it a very, very light scraping.
[02:18:01.670 --> 02:18:03.910]  All the clone that is going to be dipped
[02:18:03.910 --> 02:18:05.310]  into the Rapid Rooter
[02:18:05.310 --> 02:18:07.310]  will get just a very light scraping.
[02:18:07.310 --> 02:18:08.390]  Don't overdo it.
[02:18:08.390 --> 02:18:10.030]  If you see the white part of the plant,
[02:18:10.030 --> 02:18:10.910]  you've gone too deep.
[02:18:11.730 --> 02:18:12.570]  You just want to kind of disrupt
[02:18:12.570 --> 02:18:14.670]  the outer layer of the plant.
[02:18:14.670 --> 02:18:15.870]  So I just take a razor blade.
[02:18:15.870 --> 02:18:17.950]  Sometimes I even use my cloning scissors
[02:18:17.950 --> 02:18:20.030]  and I just rough up that edge just a little bit.
[02:18:20.030 --> 02:18:21.270]  You'll see the outer layer
[02:18:21.270 --> 02:18:22.750]  is a little bit of a different color
[02:18:22.750 --> 02:18:23.910]  than the inside layer.
[02:18:23.910 --> 02:18:25.870]  That's how you'll know you're doing it properly.
[02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:27.250]  Again, don't go too far.
[02:18:27.250 --> 02:18:29.750]  You can kill your clones by cutting too deep this way.
[02:18:29.750 --> 02:18:31.150]  Just give them a very little scrape.
[02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:32.550]  If you want to skip this step
[02:18:32.550 --> 02:18:34.190]  until you learn what you're doing,
[02:18:34.190 --> 02:18:35.110]  that is okay,
[02:18:35.110 --> 02:18:36.990]  but this may speed you up just a little bit
[02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:38.830]  by breaking that outer layer
[02:18:38.830 --> 02:18:40.690]  of the fleshy plant material.
[02:18:41.370 --> 02:18:42.210]  So we've got a nice cleaned up plant.
[02:18:42.210 --> 02:18:44.530]  We've cut a nice 45 degree angle.
[02:18:44.530 --> 02:18:45.930]  We've kind of scraped it up a little bit
[02:18:45.930 --> 02:18:47.050]  to remove that outer skin
[02:18:47.050 --> 02:18:48.650]  to give it an opportunity to root.
[02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:50.270]  Now we need to dip our fresh cutting
[02:18:50.270 --> 02:18:52.290]  into a rooting hormone.
[02:18:52.290 --> 02:18:53.270]  I've been doing my best
[02:18:53.270 --> 02:18:56.030]  to not recommend any specific brands or products,
[02:18:56.030 --> 02:18:58.210]  but what I have had the best experience with
[02:18:58.210 --> 02:19:01.330]  has been the Purple Clonex Cloning Gel.
[02:19:01.330 --> 02:19:03.970]  That works great for cutting clones into Rapid Rooters.
[02:19:03.970 --> 02:19:07.090]  It works great for cutting clones into Rockwool Cubes.
[02:19:07.090 --> 02:19:08.850]  It works perfectly for cutting clones
[02:19:08.850 --> 02:19:10.430]  into the Easy Clone Machines,
[02:19:11.170 --> 02:19:12.010]  and it also works well
[02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:14.110]  for cutting clones directly into soil.
[02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:14.990]  I'll tell you right away
[02:19:14.990 --> 02:19:16.870]  that that product is not organic,
[02:19:16.870 --> 02:19:19.710]  and many people will have opinions about that product.
[02:19:19.710 --> 02:19:20.970]  I am aware of what I'm using.
[02:19:20.970 --> 02:19:21.810]  I've done the reading.
[02:19:21.810 --> 02:19:22.890]  I've done the research,
[02:19:22.890 --> 02:19:24.150]  and I know what is in there,
[02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:25.110]  and I am okay with it.
[02:19:25.110 --> 02:19:27.110]  You may want to do a little bit of research
[02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:30.030]  when you are selecting your cloning hormones.
[02:19:30.030 --> 02:19:31.310]  And since I'm on the subject,
[02:19:31.310 --> 02:19:32.710]  always wear gloves
[02:19:32.710 --> 02:19:35.430]  when using any type of cloning solution.
[02:19:35.430 --> 02:19:37.550]  All right, so we've got our Clonex Gel
[02:19:37.550 --> 02:19:40.230]  or whatever cloning solution you have chosen.
[02:19:40.910 --> 02:19:42.230]  I usually pour mine out of the container.
[02:19:42.230 --> 02:19:45.470]  I don't like to dip my clone directly into that container.
[02:19:45.470 --> 02:19:47.370]  If there is a problem with my donor plant,
[02:19:47.370 --> 02:19:49.130]  now I have just dipped that dirty plant
[02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:50.750]  right into my cloning solution,
[02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:52.590]  and I plan on using this cloning solution
[02:19:52.590 --> 02:19:53.790]  to make all of my clones,
[02:19:53.790 --> 02:19:56.270]  which means I'm going to set myself up for failure
[02:19:56.270 --> 02:19:57.670]  from the very beginning.
[02:19:57.670 --> 02:20:00.270]  So pour your cloning solution out of the bottle
[02:20:00.270 --> 02:20:01.610]  into a smaller container.
[02:20:01.610 --> 02:20:04.350]  I usually use a shot glass or something similar.
[02:20:04.350 --> 02:20:05.390]  Whatever you choose to use,
[02:20:05.390 --> 02:20:07.970]  don't pour the leftovers back into the container.
[02:20:07.970 --> 02:20:09.590]  That defeats the whole purpose.
[02:20:09.590 --> 02:20:11.190]  So pour out some cloning solution.
[02:20:11.190 --> 02:20:14.870]  Then simply dunk the fresh cut end of your new cutting
[02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:16.390]  into that cloning gel.
[02:20:16.390 --> 02:20:18.750]  Just stir it around so that it gathers a little bit.
[02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:21.750]  Then gently place that end
[02:20:21.750 --> 02:20:23.710]  right into that hole in the Rapid Router.
[02:20:23.710 --> 02:20:24.730]  Don't press too hard.
[02:20:24.730 --> 02:20:26.270]  If it bends or kinks over,
[02:20:26.270 --> 02:20:28.070]  you've broken it and you've killed that clone,
[02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:30.030]  you've either got to cut that end off and start fresh
[02:20:30.030 --> 02:20:31.790]  or start with the fresh cutting.
[02:20:31.790 --> 02:20:34.750]  So gently push that cutting into that plug.
[02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:36.030]  Now you don't want it to penetrate
[02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:37.130]  all the way through the bottom.
[02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:38.950]  If it pokes out all the way through the bottom,
[02:20:38.990 --> 02:20:40.190]  that end of it is just going to rot
[02:20:40.190 --> 02:20:41.990]  and it's going to turn black and die.
[02:20:41.990 --> 02:20:44.190]  If you've buried your cutting too far under the router,
[02:20:44.190 --> 02:20:45.030]  it'll be okay.
[02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:46.670]  Just grab it and pull it right on out.
[02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:49.350]  Just pull it real gently and back it out just a little bit
[02:20:49.350 --> 02:20:50.630]  and it will be fine.
[02:20:50.630 --> 02:20:52.890]  So make sure you go deep enough into the root plug
[02:20:52.890 --> 02:20:55.390]  for the plant to grab and have some sort of life in there,
[02:20:55.390 --> 02:20:58.310]  but don't go so far that it pokes all the way through.
[02:20:58.310 --> 02:20:59.550]  When we were planting seeds,
[02:20:59.550 --> 02:21:01.590]  I taught you to only go knuckle deep.
[02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:03.390]  You may need to go a little deeper than that
[02:21:03.390 --> 02:21:06.030]  when you're sticking your cuttings into the Rapid Routers.
[02:21:06.030 --> 02:21:08.230]  If you're using a Rapid Router or a Root Riot,
[02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:10.790]  I recommend you go about three quarters of the way
[02:21:10.790 --> 02:21:11.930]  into the root plug.
[02:21:11.930 --> 02:21:13.170]  So if they're an inch deep,
[02:21:13.170 --> 02:21:16.110]  go three quarters of an inch down into that plug.
[02:21:16.110 --> 02:21:18.190]  And now you basically repeat that process
[02:21:18.190 --> 02:21:21.190]  until you've got your desired amount of clones cut,
[02:21:21.190 --> 02:21:23.390]  dipped and stuck into the cubes.
[02:21:23.390 --> 02:21:24.910]  Once I've got my tray full,
[02:21:24.910 --> 02:21:26.550]  I spray the inside of the dome,
[02:21:26.550 --> 02:21:28.310]  I close the vents of the dome,
[02:21:28.310 --> 02:21:29.910]  I put that on the tray
[02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:32.390]  and then I set it underneath a T5 light.
[02:21:32.390 --> 02:21:34.230]  I like to put my T5 light
[02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:37.010]  about six to 10 inches above my clone dome
[02:21:37.010 --> 02:21:40.330]  and I leave those lights on for 24 hours a day.
[02:21:40.330 --> 02:21:41.950]  You'll find it is much easier
[02:21:41.950 --> 02:21:44.290]  to control the environment around your clones
[02:21:44.290 --> 02:21:47.190]  if they don't have any changes in light cycle.
[02:21:47.190 --> 02:21:49.630]  Every time the light goes on and the light goes off,
[02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:51.650]  the temperature and the humidity will change
[02:21:51.650 --> 02:21:54.150]  and you will change the environment in your clone dome.
[02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:58.450]  Your goal is to keep your clones warm and moist and humid.
[02:21:58.450 --> 02:22:00.450]  So by keeping the light on all of the time,
[02:22:00.450 --> 02:22:02.790]  we're able to keep a consistent environment
[02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:04.350]  inside of that dome.
[02:22:04.350 --> 02:22:07.070]  So now we have got our fresh cuttings cleaned up,
[02:22:07.070 --> 02:22:08.810]  we've got them dipped into cloning solution,
[02:22:08.810 --> 02:22:10.870]  we've got them stuck into the rapid routers,
[02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:12.310]  we sprayed the inside of the dome,
[02:22:12.310 --> 02:22:14.010]  we closed the vents on the dome,
[02:22:14.010 --> 02:22:15.810]  we put the dome on the tray,
[02:22:15.810 --> 02:22:18.810]  then we slid the whole clone set up underneath the T5 light.
[02:22:18.810 --> 02:22:20.190]  Now here comes the hardest part,
[02:22:20.190 --> 02:22:22.110]  the hard part is waiting.
[02:22:22.110 --> 02:22:25.070]  You don't even need to check on your clones for three days
[02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:27.270]  if you've got the proper conditions.
[02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:28.990]  As long as you see condensation
[02:22:28.990 --> 02:22:31.430]  on the inside of that dome over the next few days,
[02:22:31.430 --> 02:22:34.310]  you don't need to do anything to those clones.
[02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:36.190]  Around day four or five,
[02:22:36.190 --> 02:22:39.590]  those clones may need to be re-moistened.
[02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:41.430]  Pop the dome off of the clones
[02:22:41.430 --> 02:22:43.710]  and take a look at the rapid routers.
[02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:45.270]  Don't be afraid to pick one up,
[02:22:45.270 --> 02:22:47.310]  pull it right out of the tray and feel it.
[02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:48.230]  Is it heavy?
[02:22:48.230 --> 02:22:49.230]  Is it moist?
[02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:50.330]  Is it dry?
[02:22:50.330 --> 02:22:51.830]  Visually look at it.
[02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:54.830]  It's really easy to tell when rapid routers need moisture
[02:22:54.830 --> 02:22:56.230]  by looking at them.
[02:22:56.230 --> 02:22:58.410]  When they are soaked, they are black.
[02:22:58.410 --> 02:23:00.230]  They look completely black.
[02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:02.030]  When they start drying up a little bit,
[02:23:02.030 --> 02:23:04.070]  they get a little bit of a silvery gray.
[02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:06.790]  When they are too dry, they become brown.
[02:23:06.790 --> 02:23:09.910]  Try to keep them moist, but not soggy.
[02:23:09.910 --> 02:23:11.810]  If you give it a little gentle squeeze,
[02:23:11.810 --> 02:23:13.750]  you don't want the water to run down your arms,
[02:23:13.750 --> 02:23:16.230]  but you need a little moisture to stay on your fingers.
[02:23:16.230 --> 02:23:18.230]  We want them moist, but not soggy.
[02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:21.110]  We need that rapid router to be able to hold enough water
[02:23:21.110 --> 02:23:22.350]  to sustain life,
[02:23:22.350 --> 02:23:24.350]  but we also don't want to have so much water
[02:23:24.350 --> 02:23:27.990]  in that rapid router that there is no room for oxygen.
[02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:30.130]  So check your rapid router for moisture.
[02:23:30.130 --> 02:23:32.550]  If it is dry, we need to re-moisten it.
[02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:34.710]  I recommend using a spray bottle
[02:23:34.710 --> 02:23:37.430]  and spraying a very light nutrient mix
[02:23:37.430 --> 02:23:38.630]  into the rapid routers
[02:23:38.630 --> 02:23:40.670]  and just spray it until they are soaked.
[02:23:40.670 --> 02:23:42.670]  Then pour off the excess water.
[02:23:42.670 --> 02:23:45.610]  If there's any water left in that tray, simply pour it off.
[02:23:45.610 --> 02:23:47.950]  We don't need water sitting in the bottom of that tray.
[02:23:47.950 --> 02:23:49.430]  When roots do start to develop,
[02:23:49.430 --> 02:23:51.790]  if they're hanging in that water, they will just rot.
[02:23:51.790 --> 02:23:53.470]  It will defeat the purpose.
[02:23:53.470 --> 02:23:55.710]  So give the rapid routers a little bit of a spray.
[02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:57.190]  Get them nice and moist.
[02:23:57.190 --> 02:23:59.150]  Once you've got all the plugs nice and moist,
[02:23:59.150 --> 02:24:00.710]  put the dome right back on the tray
[02:24:00.710 --> 02:24:02.510]  and put it back under the light.
[02:24:03.350 --> 02:24:07.070]  Now on day five, we're going to open the vents on the dome.
[02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:09.470]  If you've got a dome with the two small vents,
[02:24:09.470 --> 02:24:10.830]  you can open them all the way.
[02:24:10.830 --> 02:24:13.370]  If you've got that dome with the giant vent in the middle,
[02:24:13.370 --> 02:24:15.770]  I would say maybe go a quarter, maybe go halfway.
[02:24:15.770 --> 02:24:17.190]  Don't go all the way right away.
[02:24:17.190 --> 02:24:18.350]  That is too much airflow.
[02:24:18.350 --> 02:24:20.230]  I feel like that hole is too big.
[02:24:20.230 --> 02:24:22.110]  So on day five, we open the vents
[02:24:22.110 --> 02:24:24.910]  and start giving those clones a little bit of airflow.
[02:24:24.910 --> 02:24:26.570]  Now we're going to need to pay attention
[02:24:26.570 --> 02:24:28.950]  to the moisture level a little more frequently
[02:24:28.950 --> 02:24:31.390]  because we are allowing moisture out of that dome
[02:24:31.390 --> 02:24:32.550]  by opening those vents.
[02:24:32.550 --> 02:24:34.010]  We are letting fresh air in,
[02:24:34.010 --> 02:24:36.150]  but we are also letting our moisture out.
[02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:39.510]  So start paying attention to the clones more frequently.
[02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:40.970]  Now, beginning at day six,
[02:24:40.970 --> 02:24:43.550]  we're going to start hardening off the clones.
[02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:45.470]  What that means is we're simply going to start
[02:24:45.470 --> 02:24:48.630]  removing that dome and introducing them to the environment
[02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:49.870]  slowly every day.
[02:24:49.870 --> 02:24:51.710]  We don't want to just take off that dome
[02:24:51.710 --> 02:24:52.990]  and expect the plants to live.
[02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:53.910]  That's not going to work.
[02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:56.750]  We've got to introduce them to the environment slowly.
[02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:59.390]  Right now, they're really relying on that dome
[02:24:59.390 --> 02:25:01.630]  to keep the wind down and keep the humidity
[02:25:01.630 --> 02:25:03.850]  and moisture in that environment for them.
[02:25:03.850 --> 02:25:05.950]  We need to get them used to being in population
[02:25:05.950 --> 02:25:07.790]  with the rest of the big plants.
[02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:10.070]  The way to do this is to take that dome off
[02:25:10.070 --> 02:25:13.790]  and slowly increase the interval without the dome every day.
[02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:16.030]  So starting at day six,
[02:25:16.030 --> 02:25:19.430]  we're going to take the dome off for 15 minutes.
[02:25:19.430 --> 02:25:20.590]  Just take that dome off,
[02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:22.850]  let the plant survive for 15 minutes, check on them.
[02:25:22.850 --> 02:25:25.230]  If you feel like they're too dry, moisten them up,
[02:25:25.230 --> 02:25:26.670]  put the dome right back on,
[02:25:26.670 --> 02:25:29.130]  let the plants hang out for the rest of the day.
[02:25:29.870 --> 02:25:31.770]  The second day, we're going to crack that dome
[02:25:31.770 --> 02:25:33.250]  for 15 minutes.
[02:25:33.250 --> 02:25:36.090]  Pop off the dome, see how wet those rapid rooters are.
[02:25:36.090 --> 02:25:38.690]  If you feel like they're too dry, moisten them up,
[02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:40.330]  let them sit for 15 minutes.
[02:25:40.330 --> 02:25:42.510]  Check the moisture level again before you close them up.
[02:25:42.510 --> 02:25:45.010]  If you feel like they're too dry, moisten them up.
[02:25:45.010 --> 02:25:47.410]  It's always better to moisten them as you open them
[02:25:47.410 --> 02:25:49.910]  so that you don't soak them and then put the lid on.
[02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:52.370]  I recommend you take the dome off, moisten them,
[02:25:52.370 --> 02:25:54.690]  let them get their 15 minutes of hardening time,
[02:25:54.690 --> 02:25:56.770]  then check those rapid rooters again.
[02:25:56.770 --> 02:25:58.230]  If you feel like they may need moisture,
[02:25:58.230 --> 02:26:00.790]  go ahead and add some, then put that dome on there.
[02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:03.650]  We are going to repeat this process again on day three.
[02:26:03.650 --> 02:26:06.030]  They get 15 minutes on day three.
[02:26:06.030 --> 02:26:06.990]  Then on day four,
[02:26:06.990 --> 02:26:10.390]  we are going to increase our interval to 20 minutes.
[02:26:10.390 --> 02:26:14.310]  Then on day five, we are going to increase to 30 minutes.
[02:26:14.310 --> 02:26:15.990]  Now you have to pay attention to the clones
[02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.830]  as you're doing this.
[02:26:16.830 --> 02:26:18.910]  If they start looking weak or if they're getting angry
[02:26:18.910 --> 02:26:20.070]  while the dome is off,
[02:26:20.070 --> 02:26:21.790]  feel free to put that dome back on there
[02:26:21.790 --> 02:26:22.810]  and rescue your plants.
[02:26:22.810 --> 02:26:25.110]  But the goal here is to harden these plants off
[02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:26.430]  so they can learn to survive
[02:26:26.430 --> 02:26:28.830]  without that dome for protection.
[02:26:28.830 --> 02:26:31.030]  So as these clones start getting stronger,
[02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:33.550]  we want to leave the dome off longer and longer
[02:26:33.550 --> 02:26:34.910]  as time goes on.
[02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:37.070]  We should see little roots pop out of these clones
[02:26:37.070 --> 02:26:38.310]  around seven to 10 days.
[02:26:38.310 --> 02:26:39.750]  That is very strain dependent,
[02:26:39.750 --> 02:26:42.910]  but our goal is to have these little babies into soil
[02:26:42.910 --> 02:26:45.990]  around 10 or 14 days into this process.
[02:26:45.990 --> 02:26:48.070]  So we need to slowly start getting them used
[02:26:48.070 --> 02:26:50.130]  to the outside environment by hardening them off.
[02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:53.270]  So increase your open time every day,
[02:26:53.270 --> 02:26:56.190]  but also pay attention to the plants and don't stress them.
[02:26:56.950 --> 02:26:58.830]  So maybe on day six, you go 35 minutes.
[02:26:58.830 --> 02:27:01.070]  Maybe on day seven, you go 40 minutes.
[02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:02.750]  Maybe on day eight, you're going all the way up
[02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:03.770]  to 45 minutes.
[02:27:03.770 --> 02:27:06.530]  Maybe by day 10, you've got them open for a full hour.
[02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:09.230]  Our goal here is that when we do transplant these
[02:27:09.230 --> 02:27:11.910]  into their six inch net pots or their starter pots,
[02:27:11.910 --> 02:27:13.670]  that they don't have to rely on that dome,
[02:27:13.670 --> 02:27:16.190]  that they are okay being open all of the time
[02:27:16.190 --> 02:27:18.690]  because they will no longer have a dome for protection.
[02:27:18.690 --> 02:27:21.010]  So slowly increase your open time.
[02:27:21.010 --> 02:27:23.910]  If you can get your clone domes open for two solid hours
[02:27:23.910 --> 02:27:26.750]  without seeing any negative effects on your clones,
[02:27:26.750 --> 02:27:31.110]  they're certainly ready to go into their soil or cocoa pots.
[02:27:31.110 --> 02:27:32.790]  Now, the most common mistake I see
[02:27:32.790 --> 02:27:34.150]  when people are making clones
[02:27:34.150 --> 02:27:36.810]  is they over moisten the clone plugs.
[02:27:36.810 --> 02:27:37.650]  They soak them.
[02:27:37.650 --> 02:27:39.230]  They try to drown them.
[02:27:39.230 --> 02:27:41.150]  Pay close attention to the amount of moisture
[02:27:41.150 --> 02:27:42.150]  in your clone plugs.
[02:27:42.150 --> 02:27:43.990]  You don't want to drown them.
[02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:45.250]  If you're new at cutting clones,
[02:27:45.250 --> 02:27:47.490]  I suggest you take way too many clones.
[02:27:47.490 --> 02:27:49.310]  Take way more than what you're going to need
[02:27:49.310 --> 02:27:51.390]  because you're going to kill a bunch of them
[02:27:51.390 --> 02:27:52.750]  in the learning process.
[02:27:52.750 --> 02:27:53.830]  And that is acceptable.
[02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:55.630]  This is a learning process.
[02:27:55.630 --> 02:27:58.230]  So now we basically have to sustain these clones
[02:27:58.230 --> 02:28:00.270]  in this dome until they are rooted enough
[02:28:00.270 --> 02:28:02.990]  to put into our soil or soilless mix
[02:28:02.990 --> 02:28:04.270]  or go into our hydro setup,
[02:28:04.270 --> 02:28:05.870]  whatever we choose to do with them.
[02:28:05.870 --> 02:28:07.990]  And I told you that I'm going to talk about potting
[02:28:07.990 --> 02:28:11.550]  our seedlings and potting our clones in a future episode.
[02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:13.750]  So let's move on to another cloning method.
[02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:17.090]  Let's talk about cutting clones directly into soil.
[02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:19.310]  If I were going to cut clones directly into soil,
[02:28:19.310 --> 02:28:21.150]  I would do it very similarly
[02:28:21.150 --> 02:28:24.470]  as the method I use to cut clones into rock wool cubes.
[02:28:24.470 --> 02:28:26.950]  The main difference is that I would use a beer cup
[02:28:26.950 --> 02:28:28.710]  filled with good soil.
[02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:30.010]  I try not to recommend brands,
[02:28:30.010 --> 02:28:32.070]  but I'm going to say I would probably use
[02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:34.270]  light warrior soil for my babies.
[02:28:34.270 --> 02:28:36.310]  I would buy a bag of light warrior soil
[02:28:36.310 --> 02:28:37.630]  and I would buy some beer cups
[02:28:37.630 --> 02:28:39.350]  and I would poke a bunch of holes
[02:28:39.350 --> 02:28:41.630]  in the bottom of the beer cups for drainage.
[02:28:41.630 --> 02:28:43.750]  I would pack up the beer cup with soil.
[02:28:43.750 --> 02:28:45.350]  I would moisten the soil.
[02:28:45.350 --> 02:28:47.610]  Then I would cut the clone exactly the same
[02:28:47.610 --> 02:28:48.890]  as I do for the rapid rooter.
[02:28:48.890 --> 02:28:51.330]  I would dip it into the rooting solution.
[02:28:51.330 --> 02:28:53.850]  Then I would make a hole in that soil with my finger.
[02:28:53.850 --> 02:28:56.890]  In this situation, I would go about two knuckles deep.
[02:28:56.890 --> 02:29:00.350]  Then you place that dunked clone into that hole
[02:29:00.350 --> 02:29:01.890]  and gently backfill that hole.
[02:29:01.890 --> 02:29:04.030]  Just push the soil right around the stem.
[02:29:04.030 --> 02:29:06.130]  And now you want that plant to be supported.
[02:29:06.130 --> 02:29:08.330]  And it looks like you've got a little baby plant
[02:29:08.330 --> 02:29:10.290]  sticking out of a beer cup filled with soil.
[02:29:10.290 --> 02:29:12.430]  It looks like you're basically done.
[02:29:12.430 --> 02:29:15.130]  The next step is to take a clear beer cup
[02:29:15.130 --> 02:29:17.810]  and place it upside down on top of that beer cup
[02:29:17.810 --> 02:29:19.290]  to act as a dome.
[02:29:19.290 --> 02:29:22.450]  Then I use a piece of tape, generally a piece of duct tape,
[02:29:22.450 --> 02:29:23.690]  and just wrap it right around there
[02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:25.590]  to make sure that that lid stays on there.
[02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:29.370]  And you have created a one plant dome situation.
[02:29:29.370 --> 02:29:31.450]  You've got a beer cup filled with soil.
[02:29:31.450 --> 02:29:32.410]  It's moistened.
[02:29:32.410 --> 02:29:33.450]  You've got a plant in there
[02:29:33.450 --> 02:29:35.050]  and you've put a dome right on top of it
[02:29:35.050 --> 02:29:36.570]  to keep that moisture in.
[02:29:36.570 --> 02:29:37.730]  Put that underneath a light
[02:29:37.730 --> 02:29:41.490]  and it will act just like the domed clone acts.
[02:29:41.490 --> 02:29:42.730]  Just like the rapid rooter,
[02:29:42.730 --> 02:29:44.430]  we're gonna need to check on that soil.
[02:29:44.430 --> 02:29:45.570]  We need to keep it moist.
[02:29:45.570 --> 02:29:46.570]  We don't want it soggy.
[02:29:46.570 --> 02:29:47.570]  We don't want it soaked.
[02:29:48.330 --> 02:29:49.170]  And we don't want it dry,
[02:29:49.170 --> 02:29:50.530]  but we need it moist and warm
[02:29:50.530 --> 02:29:52.970]  so that our clone stays healthy and happy.
[02:29:52.970 --> 02:29:55.530]  Now the advantage here is once that clone roots,
[02:29:55.530 --> 02:29:56.610]  we don't have any work to do.
[02:29:56.610 --> 02:29:59.530]  It's already transplanted into its first pot.
[02:29:59.530 --> 02:30:02.050]  The disadvantage is that it takes as much space
[02:30:02.050 --> 02:30:03.650]  as a beer cup for each clone.
[02:30:03.650 --> 02:30:06.370]  So you can't fit 50 clones in a small space
[02:30:06.370 --> 02:30:08.610]  like you could in a rapid rooter tray.
[02:30:08.610 --> 02:30:09.670]  So the beer cups work.
[02:30:09.670 --> 02:30:11.690]  If you're only trying to take a couple clones
[02:30:11.690 --> 02:30:13.350]  and you don't wanna go buy rapid rooters
[02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:15.030]  and you don't wanna buy a dome setup,
[02:30:15.030 --> 02:30:17.570]  you can fill up a couple of beer cups with dirt,
[02:30:17.570 --> 02:30:18.630]  moisten up the soil,
[02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:20.590]  put a little hole in there with your finger,
[02:30:20.590 --> 02:30:22.550]  clip, dip and stick a few clones,
[02:30:22.550 --> 02:30:24.710]  and you can create clones just like you would
[02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:26.130]  in a dome setup.
[02:30:26.130 --> 02:30:28.590]  Make sure you harden off your cupped clones
[02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:30.390]  just like you do your domed clones,
[02:30:30.390 --> 02:30:32.830]  and you should have healthy, happy little babies
[02:30:32.830 --> 02:30:34.210]  in beer cups.
[02:30:34.210 --> 02:30:35.050]  All right, you guys,
[02:30:35.050 --> 02:30:36.030]  I've been talking for 25 minutes
[02:30:36.030 --> 02:30:37.730]  and my throat is starting to make a funky noise.
[02:30:37.730 --> 02:30:38.950]  I'm gonna press pause.
[02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:39.950]  I'm gonna take a drink.
[02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:41.790]  I'm gonna pull a couple of fat dabs.
[02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:42.710]  And when I get back,
[02:30:42.710 --> 02:30:44.410]  we will continue a lesson on cloning
[02:30:44.930 --> 02:30:46.330]  and we will talk about cutting clones
[02:30:46.330 --> 02:30:50.390]  in an EZCloner or a Botanicare TurboCloner machine.
[02:30:50.390 --> 02:30:51.930]  Take a couple of fat dabs, you guys.
[02:30:51.930 --> 02:30:53.370]  I will be right back.
[02:30:53.370 --> 02:30:54.990]  All right, podcast world, I am back,
[02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:56.810]  and it is time to talk about cutting clones
[02:30:56.810 --> 02:30:58.090]  in an AeroCloner,
[02:30:58.090 --> 02:30:59.890]  and that will include an EZCloner
[02:30:59.890 --> 02:31:01.610]  or a Botanicare TurboCloner
[02:31:01.610 --> 02:31:04.290]  or whatever type of auto cloner you may have purchased
[02:31:04.290 --> 02:31:06.610]  or maybe even built on your own.
[02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:07.750]  Let's jump right into it.
[02:31:07.750 --> 02:31:09.030]  My first piece of advice
[02:31:09.030 --> 02:31:12.510]  is to replace all of your clone collars each cycle
[02:31:12.510 --> 02:31:16.550]  and start with fresh, clean neoprene clone collars.
[02:31:16.550 --> 02:31:18.870]  The only brand that I am aware of
[02:31:18.870 --> 02:31:20.890]  that I would approve of reusing
[02:31:20.890 --> 02:31:23.110]  are the Permaclone clone collars.
[02:31:23.110 --> 02:31:24.950]  They are made from a different material.
[02:31:24.950 --> 02:31:26.830]  They are much easier to sanitize,
[02:31:26.830 --> 02:31:28.070]  and they are the only brand
[02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:29.750]  that I would recommend recycling.
[02:31:29.750 --> 02:31:33.150]  They're the only brand I've had any positive experience
[02:31:33.150 --> 02:31:34.510]  trying to reuse.
[02:31:34.510 --> 02:31:36.190]  If you're using the cheap neoprenes,
[02:31:36.190 --> 02:31:38.490]  it's probably safest and most cost-effective
[02:31:38.490 --> 02:31:41.310]  to throw them away and buy freshies every run.
[02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:45.470]  It is most cost-effective to buy the Permaclone clone collars
[02:31:45.470 --> 02:31:46.910]  and follow their instructions
[02:31:46.910 --> 02:31:49.470]  on sanitizing them after each use.
[02:31:49.470 --> 02:31:50.590]  And they do not pay me.
[02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:53.470]  I've just had a lot of great experience with the product.
[02:31:53.470 --> 02:31:56.690]  So always start with fresh, clean clone collars.
[02:31:56.690 --> 02:31:58.270]  The next step is to make sure
[02:31:58.270 --> 02:32:00.630]  that the cloner is completely cleaned.
[02:32:00.630 --> 02:32:03.030]  I like to fill the cloner up with hot water and bleach
[02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:05.230]  and let it run for about 24 hours.
[02:32:05.230 --> 02:32:07.590]  Then I dump it out, hose it out real well,
[02:32:07.590 --> 02:32:08.710]  fill it up with clean water,
[02:32:08.710 --> 02:32:10.130]  and let it run for just a little while
[02:32:10.130 --> 02:32:12.410]  to make sure I rinse all that bleach water out.
[02:32:12.410 --> 02:32:13.810]  Then I dump it out and let it dry.
[02:32:13.810 --> 02:32:15.990]  Once it's fully dry, I give it a smell.
[02:32:15.990 --> 02:32:17.210]  If I don't smell any bleach,
[02:32:17.210 --> 02:32:18.910]  I'm pretty sure that it's clean.
[02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:21.570]  At this point, I fill it up with clean water.
[02:32:21.570 --> 02:32:23.570]  I would suggest RO water if you've got it,
[02:32:23.570 --> 02:32:25.870]  but that is not an option for everybody.
[02:32:25.870 --> 02:32:27.530]  When I'm filling up the EZCloners,
[02:32:27.530 --> 02:32:29.970]  I generally fill them right below the halo.
[02:32:29.970 --> 02:32:33.150]  The spray halo is where you screw the emitters.
[02:32:33.150 --> 02:32:34.170]  That part's called the halo.
[02:32:34.170 --> 02:32:36.530]  There's the pump and then the halo and then the emitters.
[02:32:36.530 --> 02:32:39.490]  I fill it up right to the base of the halo.
[02:32:39.490 --> 02:32:42.370]  Once I've got the appropriate amount of water in the cloner,
[02:32:42.370 --> 02:32:44.770]  I apply Clonex solution,
[02:32:44.770 --> 02:32:46.790]  the purple stuff that comes in the tall bottle,
[02:32:46.790 --> 02:32:49.470]  not the thick stuff, but the cloning solution,
[02:32:49.470 --> 02:32:50.510]  not the clone gel.
[02:32:50.510 --> 02:32:52.450]  It's called Clonex solution.
[02:32:52.450 --> 02:32:55.390]  I apply that to the cloner to get the EC
[02:32:55.390 --> 02:32:58.730]  between 1.0 and 1.2.
[02:32:58.730 --> 02:33:01.550]  I want my EC, the electrical conductivity,
[02:33:01.550 --> 02:33:04.730]  to be between one and 1.2.
[02:33:04.730 --> 02:33:09.730]  Then I adjust the pH to 5.7 to 6.2.
[02:33:09.930 --> 02:33:12.250]  Now the next step is to add Clear Res.
[02:33:12.250 --> 02:33:14.910]  Clear Res is a product that will prevent algae
[02:33:14.910 --> 02:33:17.410]  from building up inside of our cloner.
[02:33:17.410 --> 02:33:21.450]  I recommend you put 30 milliliters of Clear Res
[02:33:21.450 --> 02:33:24.530]  for every five gallons of water in your cloner.
[02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:26.730]  So if you filled it up with a five gallon bucket,
[02:33:26.730 --> 02:33:28.170]  you need 30 milliliters.
[02:33:28.170 --> 02:33:29.750]  If you filled it up with 10 gallons,
[02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:32.850]  you need 60 milliliters and so forth.
[02:33:32.850 --> 02:33:33.930]  Date it.
[02:33:33.970 --> 02:33:36.570]  Get a little sticker and write the date on that sticker
[02:33:36.570 --> 02:33:40.250]  and put that sticker on the cloner somewhere.
[02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:42.450]  That sticker with the date is important
[02:33:42.450 --> 02:33:45.050]  because you will need to add Clear Res again
[02:33:45.050 --> 02:33:46.730]  every five days.
[02:33:46.730 --> 02:33:48.490]  That's why I put a sticker on there.
[02:33:48.490 --> 02:33:49.970]  That way, if you're working in a facility
[02:33:49.970 --> 02:33:51.490]  with more than one person,
[02:33:51.490 --> 02:33:52.770]  you don't have people doubling up
[02:33:52.770 --> 02:33:54.210]  and adding too much Clear Res.
[02:33:54.210 --> 02:33:55.490]  Everybody's on the same page.
[02:33:55.490 --> 02:33:56.530]  There's a sticker.
[02:33:56.530 --> 02:33:58.250]  It says employee number 420,
[02:33:58.250 --> 02:34:00.330]  change the Clear Res on day one.
[02:34:00.330 --> 02:34:01.730]  Now when day five comes around,
[02:34:01.730 --> 02:34:03.690]  we know somebody needs to change the Clear Res.
[02:34:04.450 --> 02:34:07.170]  So you get 30 milliliters of Clear Res per five gallons
[02:34:07.170 --> 02:34:09.010]  and pour it right on into the cloner.
[02:34:09.010 --> 02:34:12.010]  Get a sticker, write employee number 420,
[02:34:12.010 --> 02:34:14.650]  put this much Clear Res in here on this date.
[02:34:14.650 --> 02:34:16.690]  And that way we know when to add more
[02:34:16.690 --> 02:34:17.810]  and we don't double up.
[02:34:17.810 --> 02:34:20.450]  So write down how much Clear Res you put in there
[02:34:20.450 --> 02:34:22.930]  and how often you do it so that you don't double up.
[02:34:22.930 --> 02:34:25.970]  And again, I suggest you put 30 milliliters
[02:34:25.970 --> 02:34:29.370]  per every five gallons, every five days.
[02:34:29.370 --> 02:34:31.450]  So now we've added our CloneX solution.
[02:34:31.450 --> 02:34:34.330]  We've got our EC somewhere between one and 1.2.
[02:34:34.330 --> 02:34:38.490]  We've adjusted the pH to somewhere between 5.7 and 6.2.
[02:34:38.490 --> 02:34:41.250]  We've added the appropriate amount of Clear Res.
[02:34:41.250 --> 02:34:43.130]  Now let's put the lid on the cloner.
[02:34:43.130 --> 02:34:45.490]  Let's turn on the pumps and make sure all of the emitters
[02:34:45.490 --> 02:34:47.170]  are properly functioning.
[02:34:47.170 --> 02:34:49.330]  You're gonna need to open it up and peek in there
[02:34:49.330 --> 02:34:50.850]  and make sure that all those sprayers
[02:34:50.850 --> 02:34:51.810]  are spraying everywhere
[02:34:51.810 --> 02:34:53.910]  and that all of the inside of that cloner
[02:34:53.910 --> 02:34:55.450]  is getting coverage.
[02:34:55.450 --> 02:34:57.210]  Pop out a couple of random neoprenes
[02:34:57.210 --> 02:34:58.490]  and put your finger in there
[02:34:58.490 --> 02:35:00.290]  and make sure that your finger is getting sprayed.
[02:35:00.290 --> 02:35:02.170]  We wanna make sure that all of the sprayers
[02:35:02.170 --> 02:35:05.570]  are covering all of the cloner spots inside of that cloner.
[02:35:05.570 --> 02:35:07.290]  Now, once you're sure that cloner is set up
[02:35:07.290 --> 02:35:08.330]  and functioning properly
[02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:09.890]  and that all of the emitters are spraying
[02:35:09.890 --> 02:35:12.250]  and covering the entire inside of that cloner,
[02:35:12.250 --> 02:35:16.090]  it is time to take our cuttings to fill the clone machine.
[02:35:16.090 --> 02:35:19.050]  We are going to take our cuttings in a very similar method
[02:35:19.050 --> 02:35:22.330]  as we did in the rapid router technique.
[02:35:22.330 --> 02:35:24.810]  We're going to cut about a five to eight inch cutting.
[02:35:24.810 --> 02:35:26.330]  We're gonna clean it up.
[02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:29.430]  We don't need to trim these leaves as extremely as we did
[02:35:29.430 --> 02:35:30.450]  on the other setup,
[02:35:30.450 --> 02:35:32.770]  but it is a good idea to cut the tips off a little bit
[02:35:32.770 --> 02:35:34.490]  to encourage some growth.
[02:35:34.490 --> 02:35:36.210]  So, clean up your cutting.
[02:35:36.210 --> 02:35:39.210]  Then, cut it at a 45 degree angle.
[02:35:39.210 --> 02:35:41.130]  Stick it in the CloneX gel.
[02:35:41.130 --> 02:35:44.330]  I would go about one inch into the CloneX gel.
[02:35:44.330 --> 02:35:47.790]  Then, those neoprene discs open up like a Pac-Man.
[02:35:47.790 --> 02:35:49.750]  Open it up to look like Pac-Man
[02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:51.610]  and then close it around your clone
[02:35:51.610 --> 02:35:54.650]  and you want approximately one inch of material
[02:35:54.650 --> 02:35:56.930]  sticking out of the bottom of the clone.
[02:35:56.930 --> 02:35:58.530]  Then you take that neoprene disc
[02:35:58.550 --> 02:36:00.630]  and stick it right back into the machine
[02:36:00.630 --> 02:36:03.270]  with that freshly cut part sticking down into the water
[02:36:03.270 --> 02:36:05.230]  and the new plant sticking straight up.
[02:36:05.230 --> 02:36:07.030]  Now, carefully repeat that process
[02:36:07.030 --> 02:36:08.270]  until you fill the cloner
[02:36:08.270 --> 02:36:10.530]  or you run out of healthy cuttings.
[02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:13.350]  Now, I like to hang a T5 light above the clone machine
[02:36:13.350 --> 02:36:16.430]  and I generally place it about eight to 12 inches
[02:36:16.430 --> 02:36:18.990]  above the canopy of the plants.
[02:36:18.990 --> 02:36:20.510]  I also like to leave the light on
[02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:22.630]  for 24 hours for these clones.
[02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:25.230]  Some people may choose to go 18 on, six off.
[02:36:25.230 --> 02:36:26.310]  That is up to you.
[02:36:26.330 --> 02:36:28.250]  I have had amazing results
[02:36:28.250 --> 02:36:30.690]  running the lights on for 24 hours
[02:36:30.690 --> 02:36:33.610]  and also leaving the pump inside of the cloner on
[02:36:33.610 --> 02:36:34.850]  for 24 hours a day.
[02:36:34.850 --> 02:36:37.970]  You can experiment with light cycles and pump cycles
[02:36:37.970 --> 02:36:39.130]  as much as you'd like.
[02:36:39.130 --> 02:36:42.090]  You may find that 24 hours of light works best for you.
[02:36:42.090 --> 02:36:44.910]  You may find that some dark cycle works best for you.
[02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:47.930]  If the water in your cloner is getting too hot,
[02:36:47.930 --> 02:36:49.970]  a good way to cool that water down
[02:36:49.970 --> 02:36:53.570]  is by letting the pump rest for a few seconds every minute
[02:36:53.570 --> 02:36:55.570]  or a few minutes every hour.
[02:36:55.590 --> 02:36:59.710]  In one situation, I would run the pump for 45 seconds on
[02:36:59.710 --> 02:37:02.230]  and 15 seconds off every minute.
[02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:03.970]  Those timers are quite expensive.
[02:37:03.970 --> 02:37:05.190]  In another environment,
[02:37:05.190 --> 02:37:07.550]  I was running the pump on for 45 minutes
[02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:09.950]  and off for 15 minutes every hour
[02:37:09.950 --> 02:37:12.250]  and both of those methods worked well for me,
[02:37:12.250 --> 02:37:15.850]  but the 24 hour a day method worked just as well.
[02:37:15.850 --> 02:37:18.110]  Now, we've got our cloner filled up with fresh cuts.
[02:37:18.110 --> 02:37:19.590]  It's gonna run overnight.
[02:37:19.590 --> 02:37:21.630]  Tomorrow, we need to check on it.
[02:37:21.630 --> 02:37:23.910]  Overnight, that purple cloning solution
[02:37:23.910 --> 02:37:25.430]  which we dunked the cuttings in
[02:37:26.290 --> 02:37:27.530]  is going to be washed off of the plant
[02:37:27.530 --> 02:37:29.930]  and it's going to end up in our reservoir,
[02:37:29.930 --> 02:37:31.850]  in our water, in our cloner.
[02:37:31.850 --> 02:37:34.170]  That's going to make the pH go crazy.
[02:37:34.170 --> 02:37:36.690]  So we need to check the pH first thing in the morning
[02:37:36.690 --> 02:37:37.850]  and correct it.
[02:37:37.850 --> 02:37:40.790]  Don't be surprised if the pH has jumped dramatically.
[02:37:40.790 --> 02:37:42.830]  It's because all of that purple stuff
[02:37:42.830 --> 02:37:45.690]  dripped off of the plants and it is now in your water.
[02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:48.490]  So just simply adjust the pH up or down.
[02:37:48.490 --> 02:37:52.610]  Use a few drops of a reliable pH up or down product.
[02:37:52.610 --> 02:37:54.130]  Don't use some home remedy
[02:37:54.150 --> 02:37:56.110]  or some cheapo product for your cloner.
[02:37:56.110 --> 02:38:00.690]  In the cloner, we need a reliable pH up or pH down product.
[02:38:00.690 --> 02:38:04.230]  Also, I recommend a reliable pH pen.
[02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:05.990]  Don't buy a cheap pH pen.
[02:38:05.990 --> 02:38:07.350]  You get what you pay for
[02:38:07.350 --> 02:38:10.190]  when it comes to pH testing products.
[02:38:10.190 --> 02:38:12.490]  These cuttings are going to live in this cloner
[02:38:12.490 --> 02:38:14.830]  for approximately 14 days.
[02:38:14.830 --> 02:38:17.230]  We're going to have to check on them every day.
[02:38:17.230 --> 02:38:19.390]  There are a few things we need to check on.
[02:38:19.390 --> 02:38:22.790]  The first thing we should check on is general plant health.
[02:38:22.790 --> 02:38:23.830]  Are they alive?
[02:38:23.850 --> 02:38:25.010]  Are they standing up?
[02:38:25.010 --> 02:38:27.090]  Are they getting yellow and crinkly?
[02:38:27.090 --> 02:38:28.750]  Can you see any spider mites?
[02:38:28.750 --> 02:38:30.390]  Can you see any spider mite damage?
[02:38:30.390 --> 02:38:32.290]  Can you see any spider mite webbing?
[02:38:32.290 --> 02:38:34.170]  Do you see any powdery mildew?
[02:38:34.170 --> 02:38:36.690]  Do the plants show any sign of stress?
[02:38:36.690 --> 02:38:38.890]  Just give a nice visual inspection
[02:38:38.890 --> 02:38:41.370]  of the plants every single day.
[02:38:41.370 --> 02:38:43.890]  The next thing I suggest you check is the pump.
[02:38:43.890 --> 02:38:45.250]  Is the pump plugged in?
[02:38:45.250 --> 02:38:47.350]  Is the pump working properly?
[02:38:47.350 --> 02:38:50.010]  The pump is basically the heart of that machine,
[02:38:50.010 --> 02:38:52.290]  so make sure it is working.
[02:38:52.310 --> 02:38:55.230]  The next thing I recommend you check is the water level.
[02:38:55.230 --> 02:38:58.190]  Is the water level just below the halo?
[02:38:58.190 --> 02:39:00.670]  While you're in there, why not check the temperature?
[02:39:00.670 --> 02:39:02.190]  Why not check the pH?
[02:39:02.190 --> 02:39:05.470]  And why not check the EC of the water in your cloner?
[02:39:05.470 --> 02:39:08.290]  You've got it open, grab your pens, grab your meters,
[02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:10.590]  give it a little test, and write it down.
[02:39:10.590 --> 02:39:12.510]  So once you've made sure the pump is working,
[02:39:12.510 --> 02:39:14.670]  you've checked the water level, you've checked the EC,
[02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:16.910]  you've checked the pH, and you've checked the temperature,
[02:39:16.910 --> 02:39:18.390]  I would put the lid back on,
[02:39:18.390 --> 02:39:20.350]  and then I would remove one of the collars
[02:39:20.370 --> 02:39:21.650]  and put my finger in there
[02:39:21.650 --> 02:39:24.290]  and make sure that the water is spraying everywhere.
[02:39:24.290 --> 02:39:26.530]  Look inside the hole while that neoprene is gone
[02:39:26.530 --> 02:39:27.730]  and see if you can see
[02:39:27.730 --> 02:39:29.690]  that all the plants are getting sprayed.
[02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:32.410]  Put that neoprene disc back, and if you're brave,
[02:39:32.410 --> 02:39:34.930]  lift up the edge of the cloner and look inside
[02:39:34.930 --> 02:39:37.690]  and make sure that sprayer is hitting everything.
[02:39:37.690 --> 02:39:39.770]  Try to give a visual inspection
[02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:42.130]  to each emitter inside of that machine.
[02:39:42.130 --> 02:39:43.410]  If you're using an EZ-Cloner,
[02:39:43.410 --> 02:39:45.850]  you've probably got the red emitters in there.
[02:39:45.850 --> 02:39:47.330]  Make sure none of those are clogged up.
[02:39:47.330 --> 02:39:49.290]  If you're using the Botanicare Turbo Cloner,
[02:39:49.290 --> 02:39:51.310]  I think that comes with yellow emitters.
[02:39:51.310 --> 02:39:53.530]  Make sure none of those are clogged up.
[02:39:53.530 --> 02:39:55.670]  If you do find that you've got a clogged emitter,
[02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:57.190]  you've got to find something real tiny
[02:39:57.190 --> 02:39:59.590]  to poke down in the hole and try to unclog it.
[02:39:59.590 --> 02:40:01.070]  Sometimes you have to take the emitter
[02:40:01.070 --> 02:40:04.030]  all the way out of the halo to poke it and unclog it.
[02:40:04.030 --> 02:40:05.170]  Be very careful.
[02:40:05.170 --> 02:40:08.790]  Those things get very brittle and they break very easily.
[02:40:08.790 --> 02:40:10.350]  If you plan on unscrewing one,
[02:40:10.350 --> 02:40:12.470]  I recommend you have a backup on hand
[02:40:12.470 --> 02:40:15.230]  because there's a good chance it's going to break.
[02:40:15.230 --> 02:40:17.310]  In fact, while you're thinking about it right now,
[02:40:17.310 --> 02:40:20.170]  just go to Amazon and order a bag of replacements
[02:40:20.170 --> 02:40:23.090]  because those emitters get broken all the time
[02:40:23.090 --> 02:40:24.650]  and it's going to be really frustrating
[02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:25.970]  when you're setting up your machine
[02:40:25.970 --> 02:40:28.370]  and you break two of them and you can't run your cloner
[02:40:28.370 --> 02:40:30.410]  because you've got two busted emitters.
[02:40:30.410 --> 02:40:31.530]  They're very cheap.
[02:40:31.530 --> 02:40:33.250]  The frustrating part is you've got to wait for them
[02:40:33.250 --> 02:40:34.330]  to get shipped to you.
[02:40:34.330 --> 02:40:36.490]  So buy some now and then you've got them
[02:40:36.490 --> 02:40:38.690]  for when you do break them because I promise you
[02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:40.250]  you're going to break a lot of them.
[02:40:40.250 --> 02:40:42.210]  So that's our everyday inspection.
[02:40:42.210 --> 02:40:45.090]  Now, remember we talked about the Clear Res earlier?
[02:40:45.090 --> 02:40:48.070]  We've got what I like to call the fifth day check.
[02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:52.830]  Every five days, we need to add more Clear Res to our cloner.
[02:40:52.830 --> 02:40:55.850]  We need to put 30 milliliters of Clear Res
[02:40:55.850 --> 02:40:59.290]  for every five gallons of water in that reservoir.
[02:40:59.290 --> 02:41:02.070]  Now, earlier I suggested we check the EC
[02:41:02.070 --> 02:41:05.630]  and the pH of our Res every day, but it is not required.
[02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:09.310]  What is required is that we check it every fifth day.
[02:41:09.310 --> 02:41:11.510]  At least make sure you check the pH
[02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:13.470]  and the EC every five days.
[02:41:13.490 --> 02:41:15.930]  Don't let it go longer than that without checking.
[02:41:15.930 --> 02:41:18.050]  Since you're in there adding Clear Res anyway,
[02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:20.190]  unplug the pump, lift up the lid,
[02:41:20.190 --> 02:41:22.730]  put your pH meter and your EC meter in there
[02:41:22.730 --> 02:41:24.570]  and just check it and see what it says.
[02:41:24.570 --> 02:41:26.090]  Then add your Clear Res in there,
[02:41:26.090 --> 02:41:29.390]  put the lid back on, plug it in, and it's business as usual.
[02:41:29.390 --> 02:41:31.430]  If the EC has gotten too low,
[02:41:31.430 --> 02:41:33.570]  add a little bit of the Clonex solution.
[02:41:33.570 --> 02:41:36.750]  If the pH is out of whack, adjust it appropriately.
[02:41:36.750 --> 02:41:41.370]  Always adjust the pH after you add the Clonex solution.
[02:41:41.370 --> 02:41:43.290]  If you ever find that the water level
[02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:45.750]  has gotten too low, we need to add water.
[02:41:45.750 --> 02:41:48.550]  And when we add water, we need to add, of course,
[02:41:48.550 --> 02:41:49.910]  Clonex solution.
[02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:54.670]  We need to adjust the EC somewhere between 1.0 and 1.2
[02:41:54.670 --> 02:41:56.710]  when we add Clonex solution.
[02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:58.750]  If we add water and Clonex solution,
[02:41:58.750 --> 02:42:01.410]  of course we need to adjust the pH again.
[02:42:01.410 --> 02:42:06.070]  Always keep the pH between 5.8 and 6.0.
[02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:07.550]  Now here's a random tip.
[02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:10.150]  I keep calling the top of the cloner the lid or the top.
[02:42:10.150 --> 02:42:11.490]  I keep changing up the name for it,
[02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:14.590]  but the top of the cloner has your cuttings in it.
[02:42:14.590 --> 02:42:17.470]  So when we're taking off that top to work on the water,
[02:42:17.470 --> 02:42:18.450]  be very careful.
[02:42:18.450 --> 02:42:20.910]  Keep in mind that the bottoms of your clones
[02:42:20.910 --> 02:42:22.990]  are sticking out of the bottom of that cloner.
[02:42:22.990 --> 02:42:24.790]  They are in there exposed.
[02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:26.850]  If you are going to slide that cloner
[02:42:26.850 --> 02:42:29.310]  across the top of the clone machine diagonally
[02:42:29.310 --> 02:42:31.190]  to make it rest across the cloner,
[02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:33.690]  don't let it fall to where the bottoms of those cuttings
[02:42:33.690 --> 02:42:35.910]  hit the edge of the cloner and get broken.
[02:42:35.910 --> 02:42:38.450]  It may be safest to lift the top off
[02:42:38.450 --> 02:42:40.230]  and just set it down on the table.
[02:42:40.230 --> 02:42:41.270]  It's going to drip water.
[02:42:42.050 --> 02:42:42.890]  It's going to drip stuff onto the table
[02:42:42.890 --> 02:42:44.130]  or wherever you set it,
[02:42:44.130 --> 02:42:46.290]  but you won't crush the bottoms of the cuttings
[02:42:46.290 --> 02:42:48.750]  because the cloner is tall enough to protect them.
[02:42:48.750 --> 02:42:52.230]  If you turn it diagonal across the base of the clone machine
[02:42:52.230 --> 02:42:54.530]  across the reservoir portion of the cloner,
[02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:56.270]  you do run the risk of tipping it over.
[02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:57.670]  I've seen it happen quite often.
[02:42:57.670 --> 02:42:59.910]  You get that angle going, one guy moves,
[02:42:59.910 --> 02:43:01.930]  the other guy moves, you push it one direction,
[02:43:01.930 --> 02:43:05.070]  it'll fall off a corner and you will break a lot of cuttings.
[02:43:05.070 --> 02:43:05.910]  Be careful.
[02:43:05.910 --> 02:43:08.250]  Keep in mind that those cuttings are exposed.
[02:43:08.250 --> 02:43:09.890]  They're sticking out of the bottom there.
[02:43:09.930 --> 02:43:12.290]  When you're doing work on the cloner itself,
[02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:14.270]  don't forget about the clones.
[02:43:14.270 --> 02:43:16.890]  And also, if you lift it up like it's a hatchback,
[02:43:16.890 --> 02:43:19.050]  if you just lift it up to look inside there,
[02:43:19.050 --> 02:43:21.410]  keep in mind you're probably pushing some of those clones
[02:43:21.410 --> 02:43:22.770]  directly into the light.
[02:43:22.770 --> 02:43:25.450]  You've got that T5 light hanging right above your cloner.
[02:43:25.450 --> 02:43:26.290]  And as you lift it,
[02:43:26.290 --> 02:43:28.170]  those clones on the edge closest towards you,
[02:43:28.170 --> 02:43:29.130]  they're moving right up
[02:43:29.130 --> 02:43:31.230]  and they're getting pushed into the light above you.
[02:43:31.230 --> 02:43:34.130]  So pay attention to the root base part of your cuttings
[02:43:34.130 --> 02:43:36.130]  and pay attention to the part sticking out
[02:43:36.130 --> 02:43:37.410]  of the top of the cloner
[02:43:37.410 --> 02:43:41.090]  when you're working on the inside of your clone machine.
[02:43:41.090 --> 02:43:43.410]  Now, these cuttings, which are going to turn into clones,
[02:43:43.410 --> 02:43:47.930]  will live inside of our clone machine for about 14 days.
[02:43:47.930 --> 02:43:50.010]  In about four to seven days,
[02:43:50.010 --> 02:43:52.450]  you'll see a little wart looking things pop up
[02:43:52.450 --> 02:43:54.970]  on that stem that is inside the clone machine.
[02:43:54.970 --> 02:43:57.690]  That is where the roots are going to start popping out of.
[02:43:57.690 --> 02:44:00.930]  By day 10, you should have nice roots coming out of there.
[02:44:00.930 --> 02:44:02.490]  Then by day 14,
[02:44:02.490 --> 02:44:05.250]  you should have a start of a little spaghetti factory
[02:44:05.250 --> 02:44:07.010]  just coming out of the bottom of those plants.
[02:44:07.610 --> 02:44:08.810]  It should look like a little set of dreadlocks
[02:44:08.810 --> 02:44:10.690]  hanging off of each of those plants.
[02:44:10.690 --> 02:44:13.290]  That is when it is time to take our new clones
[02:44:13.290 --> 02:44:15.890]  and put them into their soil, into their cocoa,
[02:44:15.890 --> 02:44:17.730]  or into their hydro setup.
[02:44:17.730 --> 02:44:19.130]  So that feels like a perfect spot
[02:44:19.130 --> 02:44:20.850]  to start wrapping up this lesson.
[02:44:20.850 --> 02:44:23.570]  I've already promised that in a very soon to come episode,
[02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:26.530]  I would talk about putting our seedlings and clones
[02:44:26.530 --> 02:44:28.530]  into cocoa or soil.
[02:44:28.530 --> 02:44:30.370]  So the only part left to talk about now
[02:44:30.370 --> 02:44:31.750]  is cleaning our cloner.
[02:44:31.750 --> 02:44:34.870]  Once you are done with the cloner, we need to clean it.
[02:44:34.910 --> 02:44:37.150]  I start by draining all of the water.
[02:44:37.150 --> 02:44:39.930]  Then I fill it up again with fresh water.
[02:44:39.930 --> 02:44:42.630]  I also add two or three cups of bleach
[02:44:42.630 --> 02:44:44.550]  depending on the size of the cloner.
[02:44:44.550 --> 02:44:47.430]  Then I plug it in and I let it run overnight.
[02:44:47.430 --> 02:44:50.410]  The next day, I drain all of that water.
[02:44:50.410 --> 02:44:52.670]  If I'm not using Permaclone clone collars,
[02:44:52.670 --> 02:44:54.750]  I throw the collars away and buy freshies.
[02:44:54.750 --> 02:44:55.910]  If I've got Permaclones,
[02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:58.430]  I follow their instructions on how to sanitize
[02:44:58.430 --> 02:45:00.430]  and reuse them.
[02:45:00.430 --> 02:45:02.470]  Then I take the cloner outside
[02:45:02.470 --> 02:45:04.550]  and I spray it down really well with the hose
[02:45:05.230 --> 02:45:06.070]  to get rid of that bleach.
[02:45:06.070 --> 02:45:07.550]  I take it apart completely.
[02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:10.750]  I take the pump apart and I clean the pump completely.
[02:45:10.750 --> 02:45:12.870]  It is really easy to clean if you take it apart.
[02:45:12.870 --> 02:45:15.950]  Get a little toothbrush or a little brush and just scrub it.
[02:45:15.950 --> 02:45:18.030]  It does not take that long.
[02:45:18.030 --> 02:45:18.990]  Clean it.
[02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:21.070]  Then I use a paperclip or something similar
[02:45:21.070 --> 02:45:23.070]  to clean out all of the emitters.
[02:45:23.070 --> 02:45:24.230]  You guys, like I said earlier,
[02:45:24.230 --> 02:45:25.750]  have extra emitters on hand
[02:45:25.750 --> 02:45:27.070]  because when you start taking them out,
[02:45:27.070 --> 02:45:28.390]  they are going to break.
[02:45:28.390 --> 02:45:31.390]  They get brittle and they get especially more brittle
[02:45:31.390 --> 02:45:34.190]  after you run bleach through the machine.
[02:45:34.230 --> 02:45:37.110]  So clean everything up, then put it all back together.
[02:45:37.110 --> 02:45:40.470]  Then it is ready for use the next time you need clones.
[02:45:40.470 --> 02:45:41.870]  In a commercial environment,
[02:45:41.870 --> 02:45:44.870]  our easy cloners, our turbo cloners, never got a break.
[02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:46.470]  By the time the guys could empty them,
[02:45:46.470 --> 02:45:48.190]  I had two more guys carrying them outside.
[02:45:48.190 --> 02:45:49.070]  They were hosing them down.
[02:45:49.070 --> 02:45:50.510]  By the time they got brought in,
[02:45:50.510 --> 02:45:53.350]  I had cuttings cut and ready to go into those cloners.
[02:45:53.350 --> 02:45:56.750]  They never get a break in a commercial environment.
[02:45:56.750 --> 02:45:59.230]  All right, you guys, that is my lesson on cutting clones.
[02:45:59.230 --> 02:46:00.590]  I hope you enjoyed the podcast.
[02:46:00.590 --> 02:46:01.830]  I hope you learned a lot.

[02:47:18.270 --> 02:47:19.710]  with a fresh new episode.
[02:47:19.710 --> 02:47:22.710]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Kelvin Medina.
[02:47:22.710 --> 02:47:23.630]  And until next time,
[02:47:23.630 --> 02:47:26.390]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:47:28.750 --> 02:47:30.590]  Welcome to the show, cannabis community.
[02:47:30.590 --> 02:47:32.550]  It's time for episode 365
[02:47:32.550 --> 02:47:34.430]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:47:34.430 --> 02:47:35.630]  This episode is brought to you
[02:47:35.630 --> 02:47:37.350]  by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[02:47:37.350 --> 02:47:38.990]  If you need new seeds for your garden,
[02:47:38.990 --> 02:47:41.510]  I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:46.510]  and you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[02:47:47.190 --> 02:47:48.470]  I like to start the episodes off
[02:47:48.470 --> 02:47:50.230]  by letting you know what I'm smoking.
[02:47:50.230 --> 02:47:51.470]  Today, I've been taking dabs
[02:47:51.470 --> 02:47:54.070]  of this Bubble Jack Full Spectrum Extract,
[02:47:54.070 --> 02:47:56.630]  and I love the flavor and aroma of this stuff.
[02:47:56.630 --> 02:47:59.210]  It smells like bubble gum and cotton candy.
[02:47:59.210 --> 02:48:00.970]  When I dab it, it goes straight to my head.
[02:48:00.970 --> 02:48:02.410]  It makes my brain go super fast.
[02:48:02.410 --> 02:48:04.210]  It makes my mouth go super fast.
[02:48:04.210 --> 02:48:06.370]  So I think this will be a great concentrate
[02:48:06.370 --> 02:48:08.930]  for smoking before a podcast.
[02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:10.650]  All right, before we get too deep into this episode,
[02:48:10.650 --> 02:48:12.410]  I want to give a few people a shout out.
[02:48:12.410 --> 02:48:15.770]  I owe a big shout out to my friend, Jake Jordan.
[02:48:15.770 --> 02:48:17.290]  I owe a shout out to Jade,
[02:48:17.290 --> 02:48:20.230]  and also a big shout out to Grimbold the Druid,
[02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:23.050]  and also a shout out to Tanner Martinowic.
[02:48:23.050 --> 02:48:24.450]  Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[02:48:24.450 --> 02:48:27.010]  I really do appreciate all of the support.
[02:48:27.010 --> 02:48:27.850]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:48:27.850 --> 02:48:29.250]  this is going to be another grow lesson.
[02:48:29.250 --> 02:48:31.490]  I have been doing a long series of grow lessons.
[02:48:31.490 --> 02:48:33.530]  I hope you have been following along.
[02:48:33.530 --> 02:48:34.370]  If you are interested,
[02:48:34.370 --> 02:48:37.090]  I recommend you go back to episode 351.
[02:48:37.090 --> 02:48:39.530]  That's where I start this long series of grow lessons.
[02:48:39.530 --> 02:48:40.950]  Start there and get caught up.
[02:48:40.950 --> 02:48:42.390]  If you feel like you're up to speed,
[02:48:42.390 --> 02:48:43.850]  welcome to the grow lessons.
[02:48:43.850 --> 02:48:45.370]  In the last two episodes,
[02:48:45.370 --> 02:48:47.090]  we talked about sprouting seeds.
[02:48:47.090 --> 02:48:49.130]  We also talked about cutting clones.
[02:48:49.130 --> 02:48:50.210]  In this episode,
[02:48:50.210 --> 02:48:52.290]  we're going to talk about putting those seeds
[02:48:52.290 --> 02:48:57.050]  and those clones into containers of soil or soilless mix.
[02:48:57.130 --> 02:48:58.250]  Let's start with the seeds.
[02:48:58.250 --> 02:49:00.310]  We talked about germinating in paper towels.
[02:49:00.310 --> 02:49:02.850]  I may have covered this briefly in the previous episode,
[02:49:02.850 --> 02:49:04.090]  but we're going to talk about it.
[02:49:04.090 --> 02:49:05.510]  A little bit of a recap right here
[02:49:05.510 --> 02:49:08.250]  just to make sure everybody is up to speed.
[02:49:08.250 --> 02:49:09.570]  We started a few seeds.
[02:49:09.570 --> 02:49:10.730]  We folded a paper towel.
[02:49:10.730 --> 02:49:11.570]  We soaked it.
[02:49:11.570 --> 02:49:13.090]  We put seeds on the paper towel.
[02:49:13.090 --> 02:49:15.630]  We folded it again to secure the seeds inside.
[02:49:15.630 --> 02:49:16.990]  Maybe we put that in a baggie.
[02:49:16.990 --> 02:49:18.770]  Maybe we put that in a warm place.
[02:49:18.770 --> 02:49:20.210]  The seeds have now sprouted.
[02:49:20.210 --> 02:49:22.250]  Hopefully, they've got little tiny tails,
[02:49:22.250 --> 02:49:23.650]  maybe a quarter of an inch,
[02:49:23.650 --> 02:49:24.530]  maybe a half inch.
[02:49:24.530 --> 02:49:27.250]  Hopefully, you didn't go any more than one inch long.
[02:49:27.250 --> 02:49:31.010]  Here is how I recommend planting those seedlings.
[02:49:31.010 --> 02:49:33.490]  I generally try to stay away from recommending products.
[02:49:33.490 --> 02:49:34.850]  Every time I recommend a product,
[02:49:34.850 --> 02:49:37.410]  I get emails from people saying I did something wrong,
[02:49:37.410 --> 02:49:39.690]  but I want to make this easy for everybody.
[02:49:39.690 --> 02:49:43.190]  So I recommend Light Warrior Soil from Fox Farms
[02:49:43.190 --> 02:49:44.370]  for your new seedlings.
[02:49:44.370 --> 02:49:45.810]  It is readily available.
[02:49:45.810 --> 02:49:46.850]  It is affordable,
[02:49:46.850 --> 02:49:48.570]  and it works very well.
[02:49:48.570 --> 02:49:50.430]  I'm sure other people will have other ideas
[02:49:50.430 --> 02:49:51.770]  and other suggestions.
[02:49:51.770 --> 02:49:52.730]  I am okay with that.
[02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:54.150]  Do what you're comfortable with.
[02:49:54.670 --> 02:49:56.430]  I recommend this product because like I said,
[02:49:56.430 --> 02:49:58.150]  it's available, it's affordable,
[02:49:58.150 --> 02:49:59.270]  and I know that it works.
[02:49:59.270 --> 02:50:01.230]  I'm not going to send people on some crazy mission
[02:50:01.230 --> 02:50:04.270]  looking for a product that's hard to find or overpriced.
[02:50:04.270 --> 02:50:05.290]  So we've got our medium.
[02:50:05.290 --> 02:50:07.110]  You can probably get away with one bag
[02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:08.250]  of Light Warrior Soil.
[02:50:08.250 --> 02:50:10.470]  Now we need containers to put this soil in
[02:50:10.470 --> 02:50:12.070]  to put our seedlings in.
[02:50:12.070 --> 02:50:15.370]  I recommend small pots for small plants.
[02:50:15.370 --> 02:50:18.090]  There's no reason to fill up a big three gallon pot
[02:50:18.090 --> 02:50:20.250]  and then plant a little tiny seedling in there,
[02:50:20.250 --> 02:50:23.070]  and then you have to water that entire space of soil.
[02:50:23.070 --> 02:50:26.190]  You have to put water and nutrients in all of that space
[02:50:26.190 --> 02:50:28.230]  just to water that plant properly.
[02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:30.870]  If you've got your seedling inside of a little tiny cup,
[02:50:30.870 --> 02:50:32.590]  you only have to water that much space.
[02:50:32.590 --> 02:50:33.670]  You don't have to waste water,
[02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:34.830]  you don't have to waste nutrients,
[02:50:34.830 --> 02:50:36.990]  and you don't have to waste space.
[02:50:36.990 --> 02:50:40.070]  A lot of new growers really like to drown seedlings
[02:50:40.070 --> 02:50:40.950]  in larger pots.
[02:50:40.950 --> 02:50:42.590]  If they put a seedling in a larger pot,
[02:50:42.590 --> 02:50:44.310]  they've got to water all of that soil.
[02:50:44.310 --> 02:50:46.410]  So they go and they pour an entire pitcher of water
[02:50:46.410 --> 02:50:48.210]  right on top of that three gallon pot,
[02:50:48.210 --> 02:50:50.750]  then that seedling gets washed away in all that water.
[02:50:50.750 --> 02:50:52.110]  Who knows where it goes sometimes
[02:50:52.110 --> 02:50:54.390]  when people apply water, they do it kind of heavily,
[02:50:54.390 --> 02:50:56.590]  the seed gets washed away, it gets lost in there.
[02:50:56.590 --> 02:50:58.210]  They kill the seeds, they drown,
[02:50:58.210 --> 02:51:00.310]  they fail with the seeds, they get discouraged.
[02:51:00.310 --> 02:51:02.870]  So I highly recommend starting with a smaller pot,
[02:51:02.870 --> 02:51:05.970]  maybe a four inch net pot, maybe a six inch net pot,
[02:51:05.970 --> 02:51:07.330]  maybe a four inch square pot,
[02:51:07.330 --> 02:51:10.990]  maybe a six inch circular pot, something that size.
[02:51:10.990 --> 02:51:13.390]  I honestly start my seedlings in a beer cup.
[02:51:13.390 --> 02:51:16.430]  I take a few beer cups, I stack them up on top of each other
[02:51:16.430 --> 02:51:18.430]  and then I put a drill through the bottom of them.
[02:51:18.430 --> 02:51:20.790]  I can go through about eight cups at a time.
[02:51:20.790 --> 02:51:22.630]  I poke one big hole through the bottom
[02:51:22.630 --> 02:51:24.270]  and I'll do a few smaller holes on the side
[02:51:24.270 --> 02:51:25.990]  just to give some proper drainage.
[02:51:25.990 --> 02:51:28.430]  And I feel like beer cups are the perfect size
[02:51:28.430 --> 02:51:29.590]  for new baby seedlings.
[02:51:29.590 --> 02:51:31.350]  The seedlings can sprout in there,
[02:51:31.350 --> 02:51:32.430]  they can get a good start,
[02:51:32.430 --> 02:51:34.190]  they can develop a good root system.
[02:51:34.190 --> 02:51:35.490]  And by the time they get big enough,
[02:51:35.490 --> 02:51:38.590]  you can just up pot them into their three or five gallon pot
[02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:39.950]  and it works really well.
[02:51:39.950 --> 02:51:42.790]  So let's talk about actually putting these seedlings into,
[02:51:42.790 --> 02:51:44.570]  I'm going to go with the beer cup for this method.
[02:51:44.570 --> 02:51:48.430]  I've got my beer cup, I've got my Light Warrior soil mix.
[02:51:48.430 --> 02:51:51.310]  I'm going to fill my beer cup most of the way up with soil.
[02:51:51.310 --> 02:51:53.270]  I want to pack it down fairly tight.
[02:51:53.270 --> 02:51:54.510]  Then I'm going to fill it up with soil
[02:51:54.510 --> 02:51:56.210]  and leave myself about a quarter of an inch
[02:51:56.210 --> 02:51:58.590]  so that when I water, I've got plenty of room for water
[02:51:58.590 --> 02:52:00.830]  and it doesn't just run off the top of the cup.
[02:52:00.830 --> 02:52:01.750]  So I fill it up,
[02:52:01.750 --> 02:52:04.790]  I've got about a quarter inch of space left on the top.
[02:52:04.790 --> 02:52:08.550]  Then I water that soil before I even put my clone
[02:52:08.550 --> 02:52:10.230]  or my seedling into it.
[02:52:10.230 --> 02:52:12.190]  In this case, we're going to put a seedling in there.
[02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:13.110]  So I would water it.
[02:52:13.110 --> 02:52:14.210]  Since I'm going with the seedling,
[02:52:14.210 --> 02:52:17.030]  I do not use any nutrients at this time.
[02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:18.110]  I'll water it.
[02:52:18.110 --> 02:52:20.270]  I'll let all that water soak through the bottom.
[02:52:20.270 --> 02:52:23.390]  Then I take my pointer finger and I dig a little hole
[02:52:23.390 --> 02:52:25.430]  just right to the first knuckle of my finger.
[02:52:25.430 --> 02:52:27.570]  Then I put that little freshly sprouted seedling
[02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:29.010]  right inside that hole.
[02:52:29.010 --> 02:52:31.830]  If the seedling has developed a long tail, that taproot,
[02:52:31.830 --> 02:52:33.430]  if that taproot has gotten long,
[02:52:33.430 --> 02:52:36.990]  you need to make that be facing down and the seed facing up.
[02:52:36.990 --> 02:52:39.750]  You want the seed coming up and the taproot going down.
[02:52:39.750 --> 02:52:42.250]  So gently place that seed facing down
[02:52:42.250 --> 02:52:44.530]  or the taproot facing down, the seed pointing up,
[02:52:44.530 --> 02:52:45.470]  place that right in the dirt.
[02:52:45.470 --> 02:52:47.550]  Dig the hole as deep as you need to dig it
[02:52:47.550 --> 02:52:49.070]  if you've got a longer taproot.
[02:52:49.070 --> 02:52:51.310]  Just push your finger in there as long as you need to go
[02:52:51.310 --> 02:52:53.790]  and gently set that taproot down in there.
[02:52:53.790 --> 02:52:54.950]  And then you just want to put the dirt
[02:52:54.950 --> 02:52:56.030]  right over it real gently.
[02:52:56.030 --> 02:52:57.270]  You don't need to pack it down.
[02:52:57.270 --> 02:52:58.430]  Just make sure that it's covered up
[02:52:58.430 --> 02:52:59.710]  to where the light's not getting to it
[02:52:59.710 --> 02:53:01.070]  and it is packed in there tight enough.
[02:53:01.070 --> 02:53:02.490]  When you water it the next time,
[02:53:02.490 --> 02:53:04.990]  that water will probably pack it just tight enough for you.
[02:53:04.990 --> 02:53:07.070]  You don't need to press it down too much at this point.
[02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:09.430]  You don't want to risk crushing that seedling.
[02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:11.910]  So if you've got a real short tail, just go knuckle deep,
[02:53:11.910 --> 02:53:13.870]  drop that little seedling right in there and bury it.
[02:53:13.870 --> 02:53:15.550]  If you've got kind of a long tail,
[02:53:15.550 --> 02:53:17.390]  you've got to dig a little deeper of a hole,
[02:53:17.390 --> 02:53:18.670]  set that tail down in there,
[02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:20.270]  and then just carefully bury that.
[02:53:20.270 --> 02:53:23.730]  Be really careful not to disturb that white taproot.
[02:53:23.730 --> 02:53:25.950]  That is really delicate and it's important
[02:53:25.950 --> 02:53:27.830]  that it is not disrupted.
[02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:29.910]  Now your new seedlings are basically potted
[02:53:29.910 --> 02:53:31.430]  in their cups of dirt.
[02:53:31.430 --> 02:53:33.190]  I would place them under a T5 light
[02:53:33.190 --> 02:53:36.110]  with the T5 light about eight to 12 inches away.
[02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:38.910]  I would try to keep them around 75 to 85 degrees.
[02:53:38.910 --> 02:53:40.410]  And I would try to keep it quite humid
[02:53:40.410 --> 02:53:42.310]  around these little tiny baby plants.
[02:53:42.310 --> 02:53:44.430]  Now, when it comes time to water these new seedlings,
[02:53:44.430 --> 02:53:47.390]  we have to be very careful for the first few days.
[02:53:47.390 --> 02:53:51.150]  I recommend using a sprayer to water new seedlings.
[02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:53.170]  I got a tiny one gallon pump sprayer
[02:53:53.170 --> 02:53:54.770]  from the local hardware store.
[02:53:54.770 --> 02:53:57.490]  I mix it with my whatever nutrient solution I'm going to use
[02:53:57.490 --> 02:54:00.790]  or just plain water that's been pH balanced correctly.
[02:54:00.790 --> 02:54:02.110]  Then I pump it real hard
[02:54:02.110 --> 02:54:04.710]  and I just spray the top soil with that water.
[02:54:04.710 --> 02:54:06.790]  Instead of pouring a heavy dose of water in
[02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:10.210]  and risking drowning those seeds or disrupting those seeds,
[02:54:10.210 --> 02:54:11.450]  I just spray it from the top.
[02:54:11.450 --> 02:54:12.830]  I kind of spray it at a few angles.
[02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:14.810]  That way I get all the soil saturated
[02:54:14.810 --> 02:54:16.750]  and it works just like the morning dew would.
[02:54:16.750 --> 02:54:19.010]  So I feel like spraying them is really gentle
[02:54:19.010 --> 02:54:20.890]  and it works really well for new growers
[02:54:20.890 --> 02:54:23.430]  to not drown these plants and not flood the soil
[02:54:23.430 --> 02:54:25.690]  when they're starting baby seedlings.
[02:54:25.690 --> 02:54:26.910]  Now let's briefly talk about
[02:54:26.910 --> 02:54:29.570]  when to start feeding our seedlings.
[02:54:29.570 --> 02:54:32.150]  I like to start feeding when I see the first set
[02:54:32.150 --> 02:54:33.870]  of truly developed leaves.
[02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:36.570]  When you see the first set of five or seven or nine,
[02:54:36.570 --> 02:54:38.010]  depending on what variety you're growing.
[02:54:38.010 --> 02:54:40.250]  When you see the first set of full leaves,
[02:54:40.250 --> 02:54:42.550]  that's when I like to start adding nutrients.
[02:54:42.550 --> 02:54:44.670]  Depending on your brand and your product,
[02:54:44.670 --> 02:54:47.450]  I usually recommend you start with about a quarter strength.
[02:54:47.450 --> 02:54:49.850]  If the bottle says to use 40 milliliters
[02:54:49.850 --> 02:54:50.710]  of a certain product,
[02:54:50.710 --> 02:54:52.730]  I would recommend you start with 10 milliliters
[02:54:52.730 --> 02:54:53.830]  of that product.
[02:54:53.830 --> 02:54:55.790]  And then as that plant gets bigger and stronger
[02:54:55.790 --> 02:54:56.630]  and more developed,
[02:54:56.630 --> 02:55:00.030]  then you can increase your nutrient feedings to those plants.
[02:55:00.030 --> 02:55:00.950]  But while they're small,
[02:55:00.950 --> 02:55:03.190]  let's feed them lightly so we don't roast them.
[02:55:03.190 --> 02:55:05.470]  Now let's talk briefly about what to feed them.
[02:55:05.470 --> 02:55:07.830]  These plants need a little bit of nitrogen.
[02:55:07.830 --> 02:55:10.170]  They need a very small amount of phosphorus
[02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:12.190]  and a very small amount of potassium.
[02:55:12.190 --> 02:55:15.550]  Most of your basic grow nutrients will be just fine
[02:55:15.550 --> 02:55:16.630]  for small seedlings.
[02:55:16.630 --> 02:55:20.250]  I would recommend adding a root inoculant product,
[02:55:20.250 --> 02:55:22.190]  something like Mammoth Peas,
[02:55:22.190 --> 02:55:23.590]  something like Great White,
[02:55:23.590 --> 02:55:24.870]  something like Recharge,
[02:55:24.870 --> 02:55:26.510]  something like Plus Life.
[02:55:26.510 --> 02:55:28.650]  Any of those products will work for you.
[02:55:28.650 --> 02:55:29.750]  Do a little bit of research,
[02:55:29.750 --> 02:55:31.270]  find what's available in your area,
[02:55:31.270 --> 02:55:33.070]  find what fits your price range
[02:55:33.070 --> 02:55:35.670]  and get the product that will work best for you.
[02:55:35.670 --> 02:55:37.250]  Something is better than nothing
[02:55:37.250 --> 02:55:39.690]  when it comes to root inoculants and microbes
[02:55:40.190 --> 02:55:41.470]  and beneficial fungus and bacteria.
[02:55:41.470 --> 02:55:43.310]  I highly recommend it for small plants
[02:55:43.310 --> 02:55:44.310]  and I highly recommend it
[02:55:44.310 --> 02:55:47.310]  throughout the entire growing process.
[02:55:47.310 --> 02:55:48.290]  So when your plants are little,
[02:55:48.290 --> 02:55:50.350]  they're not going to need a whole lot of nutrients,
[02:55:50.350 --> 02:55:51.430]  just a base nutrient.
[02:55:51.430 --> 02:55:54.030]  And I highly recommend some sort of root inoculant.
[02:55:54.030 --> 02:55:55.830]  They won't need CalMag probably
[02:55:55.830 --> 02:55:58.110]  until we transplant them into the next pot.
[02:55:58.110 --> 02:56:00.310]  If you want to add a fulvic or a humic acid,
[02:56:00.310 --> 02:56:02.590]  that's always good for the plants at all stages.
[02:56:02.590 --> 02:56:03.430]  But at this point,
[02:56:03.430 --> 02:56:06.590]  I mainly like to focus on healthy plants with strong roots.
[02:56:06.590 --> 02:56:08.670]  So I really focus on root development
[02:56:08.690 --> 02:56:09.930]  at this stage of the game.
[02:56:09.930 --> 02:56:11.850]  I'll add microbes and beneficial fungus
[02:56:11.850 --> 02:56:13.950]  and then I'll also add carbohydrates.
[02:56:13.950 --> 02:56:15.110]  But at this point, like I said,
[02:56:15.110 --> 02:56:17.510]  I am mainly focusing on root development
[02:56:17.510 --> 02:56:20.610]  until I transplant those plants into their next pots.
[02:56:20.610 --> 02:56:21.450]  So we talked a little bit
[02:56:21.450 --> 02:56:22.930]  about what to feed these little babies.
[02:56:22.930 --> 02:56:24.690]  Let's talk about pH.
[02:56:24.690 --> 02:56:25.790]  For small seedlings,
[02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:30.050]  I like to keep my pH around 5.8 to 6.2.
[02:56:30.050 --> 02:56:31.450]  Once they get a little bit larger,
[02:56:31.450 --> 02:56:33.250]  I will increase the pH slowly
[02:56:33.250 --> 02:56:36.370]  and I'll move up towards 6.3 or 6.4.
[02:56:36.370 --> 02:56:37.570]  But for these small babies,
[02:56:37.570 --> 02:56:41.310]  let's stay closer to 5.8 or 6.2.
[02:56:41.310 --> 02:56:43.170]  Now really take your time increasing
[02:56:43.170 --> 02:56:45.350]  the amount of nutrients you give these plants
[02:56:45.350 --> 02:56:48.890]  and also take your time increasing the pH of these plants.
[02:56:48.890 --> 02:56:49.810]  They need to grow.
[02:56:49.810 --> 02:56:51.070]  They need to get a root system
[02:56:51.070 --> 02:56:54.010]  to be able to process all of the stuff you're giving them.
[02:56:54.010 --> 02:56:56.270]  These little tiny plants don't want a lot
[02:56:56.270 --> 02:56:58.270]  and you do run the risk of burning them
[02:56:58.270 --> 02:56:59.630]  if you overfeed them.
[02:56:59.630 --> 02:57:02.050]  So pay attention and go slow.
[02:57:02.050 --> 02:57:03.590]  Now after several days,
[02:57:03.590 --> 02:57:05.390]  these seedlings will start taking off.
[02:57:05.390 --> 02:57:07.190]  They'll start getting full-size leaves
[02:57:07.210 --> 02:57:09.330]  and they will start catching up to the same size
[02:57:09.330 --> 02:57:11.010]  as the clones we cut.
[02:57:11.010 --> 02:57:12.490]  Once they reach that size,
[02:57:12.490 --> 02:57:15.570]  I consider them to be small veg plants
[02:57:15.570 --> 02:57:18.290]  and I treat them just like I do my small veg plants
[02:57:18.290 --> 02:57:19.850]  and we will talk about caring for
[02:57:19.850 --> 02:57:23.770]  and feeding small veg plants here in the near future.
[02:57:23.770 --> 02:57:26.750]  Next, let's talk about planting our rapid rooters.
[02:57:26.750 --> 02:57:29.270]  Maybe we planted some seedlings in rapid rooters.
[02:57:29.270 --> 02:57:31.330]  Maybe we cut some clones into rapid rooters
[02:57:31.330 --> 02:57:32.610]  and put them in a dome
[02:57:32.610 --> 02:57:33.890]  and now they are sprouting roots
[02:57:33.890 --> 02:57:36.290]  and it is time to plant them.
[02:57:36.290 --> 02:57:37.790]  How do we know when it is time
[02:57:37.790 --> 02:57:40.990]  to plant our rapid rooter seedlings or clones?
[02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:42.950]  I like to plant seedlings as soon as I see
[02:57:42.950 --> 02:57:45.510]  that first taproot coming out of the rapid rooter.
[02:57:45.510 --> 02:57:47.710]  I don't wanna let that taproot get too long,
[02:57:47.710 --> 02:57:49.230]  too leggy and too stretchy,
[02:57:49.230 --> 02:57:52.430]  so I do my best to get those into soil right away.
[02:57:52.430 --> 02:57:54.130]  When I cut clones in rapid rooters,
[02:57:54.130 --> 02:57:56.630]  I like to make sure they are sufficiently rooted
[02:57:56.630 --> 02:57:59.030]  before I try to put them into soil.
[02:57:59.030 --> 02:58:01.230]  Make sure your clones are properly hardened off.
[02:58:01.230 --> 02:58:03.150]  We talked about this in a previous episode.
[02:58:03.150 --> 02:58:05.270]  We have to expose our domed clones
[02:58:05.270 --> 02:58:07.090]  to fresh air for durations of time
[02:58:07.090 --> 02:58:09.770]  and extend that duration over a period of time
[02:58:09.770 --> 02:58:11.090]  to make sure the clones are ready
[02:58:11.090 --> 02:58:13.730]  to not be in a humidity-controlled environment.
[02:58:13.730 --> 02:58:15.030]  We need to get them used to being
[02:58:15.030 --> 02:58:17.210]  in our regular veg environment.
[02:58:17.210 --> 02:58:18.730]  So we've been hardening off our clones
[02:58:18.730 --> 02:58:20.130]  and they show sufficient roots.
[02:58:20.130 --> 02:58:22.150]  What do I mean by sufficient roots?
[02:58:22.150 --> 02:58:25.970]  I want at least five, maybe 10 or 12 white, thick roots
[02:58:25.970 --> 02:58:27.350]  popping out of that rapid rooter.
[02:58:27.350 --> 02:58:29.170]  I want them to be just busting out of there
[02:58:29.170 --> 02:58:30.050]  and kind of thick.
[02:58:30.050 --> 02:58:32.190]  I want them to look like they're just little worms
[02:58:32.190 --> 02:58:34.130]  coming out looking for some more to go.
[02:58:34.130 --> 02:58:36.810]  If you've got more than five, maybe more than 12
[02:58:36.810 --> 02:58:38.270]  and they start building up in there,
[02:58:38.270 --> 02:58:39.790]  you were really doing well.
[02:58:39.790 --> 02:58:42.510]  We wanna develop a nice root system before we pot it,
[02:58:42.510 --> 02:58:46.270]  but there is a fine line between just enough and too much.
[02:58:46.270 --> 02:58:48.870]  If you lift that little clone up out of that tray
[02:58:48.870 --> 02:58:51.190]  and the roots have begun wrapping around the rooter,
[02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:52.510]  you've gone too far.
[02:58:52.510 --> 02:58:55.390]  If those roots are hanging down inside the rooter tray
[02:58:55.390 --> 02:58:57.750]  and hanging into the water, we have gone too far.
[02:58:57.750 --> 02:58:59.650]  We wanna get those into our soilless mix
[02:58:59.650 --> 02:59:01.030]  as soon as possible.
[02:59:01.030 --> 02:59:02.930]  I want just a little bit of dreadlocks
[02:59:02.930 --> 02:59:04.050]  just hanging out of there.
[02:59:04.770 --> 02:59:05.830]  Not a lot, just maybe a little tiny mop,
[02:59:05.830 --> 02:59:07.070]  just a little fuzz ball,
[02:59:07.070 --> 02:59:08.990]  maybe 10 or 20 of them just hanging out.
[02:59:08.990 --> 02:59:10.670]  That is prime time to pot those.
[02:59:10.670 --> 02:59:12.730]  And I want them about a half inch
[02:59:12.730 --> 02:59:15.390]  to an inch and a half long is perfect.
[02:59:15.390 --> 02:59:18.070]  Now let's put these rapid rooters into our beer cup
[02:59:18.070 --> 02:59:21.070]  full of light warrior soil or whatever size pot
[02:59:21.070 --> 02:59:22.750]  and whatever soil mix you choose to use.
[02:59:22.750 --> 02:59:24.350]  Just make sure it's a quality soil mix
[02:59:24.350 --> 02:59:25.990]  with plenty of aeration
[02:59:25.990 --> 02:59:28.230]  and make sure whatever size or whatever container you use
[02:59:28.230 --> 02:59:29.610]  has plenty of drainage.
[02:59:29.610 --> 02:59:31.870]  We don't want our plants to get muddy at the bottom,
[02:59:31.890 --> 02:59:34.250]  get stagnant water that will totally drown
[02:59:34.250 --> 02:59:35.930]  and destroy our roots, we'll get root rot.
[02:59:35.930 --> 02:59:38.010]  It will be a mess, it will be disgusting.
[02:59:38.010 --> 02:59:40.810]  So quality soil pots with good drainage,
[02:59:40.810 --> 02:59:42.110]  that is a requirement.
[02:59:42.110 --> 02:59:45.610]  Now, just like we did the beer cups for our small seedlings,
[02:59:45.610 --> 02:59:46.970]  let's fill them up with soil
[02:59:46.970 --> 02:59:49.170]  and leave ourselves about a quarter of an inch
[02:59:49.170 --> 02:59:50.910]  of space for water.
[02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:53.250]  Now, if I'm putting the seedlings in the rapid rooters
[02:59:53.250 --> 02:59:54.450]  into this soil,
[02:59:54.450 --> 02:59:57.470]  I most likely will not give them nutrients at this time.
[02:59:57.470 --> 03:00:00.450]  When I put the clones into the soil at this time,
[03:00:00.450 --> 03:00:04.230]  I do like to give them a small nutrient feeding.
[03:00:04.230 --> 03:00:06.190]  I use a light vegetative mix,
[03:00:06.190 --> 03:00:08.670]  about a quarter strength of whatever brand you're using.
[03:00:08.670 --> 03:00:10.990]  Use about a quarter strength of whatever they recommend.
[03:00:10.990 --> 03:00:13.630]  I also like to use a microbe product.
[03:00:13.630 --> 03:00:15.230]  Again, something like Mammoth Pea,
[03:00:15.230 --> 03:00:16.710]  something like Great White Shark,
[03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:18.250]  something like Recharge,
[03:00:18.250 --> 03:00:20.710]  something like Plus Life from VegBloom.
[03:00:20.710 --> 03:00:22.750]  Anything with beneficial fungus and bacteria
[03:00:22.750 --> 03:00:24.190]  that will encourage root growth
[03:00:24.190 --> 03:00:26.550]  will be great for your small plants.
[03:00:26.550 --> 03:00:28.150]  So we've got our light based nutrients,
[03:00:28.150 --> 03:00:29.710]  we've got our root inoculant.
[03:00:29.730 --> 03:00:31.130]  Let's talk about pH.
[03:00:31.130 --> 03:00:33.850]  I like to keep the pH for these small clones
[03:00:33.850 --> 03:00:37.090]  somewhere between 5.8 and 6.2.
[03:00:37.090 --> 03:00:38.730]  So we've got our base nutrients,
[03:00:38.730 --> 03:00:40.250]  we've got our root inoculant,
[03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:41.930]  we've got our solution pH.
[03:00:41.930 --> 03:00:45.050]  Now I water that solution through my cups of soil.
[03:00:45.050 --> 03:00:46.090]  Just pour it right on through
[03:00:46.090 --> 03:00:47.410]  until it drains out a little bit.
[03:00:47.410 --> 03:00:50.170]  You wanna fully saturate that new soil.
[03:00:50.170 --> 03:00:51.290]  Now, once it's done dripping
[03:00:51.290 --> 03:00:53.290]  and that soil is fully saturated,
[03:00:53.290 --> 03:00:54.810]  I will take two fingers
[03:00:54.810 --> 03:00:56.330]  and just gently make a little hole
[03:00:56.330 --> 03:00:58.090]  right in the center of that soil.
[03:00:58.090 --> 03:01:00.230]  And I go just a little bit deeper
[03:01:00.230 --> 03:01:01.990]  than the height of that Rapid Rooter.
[03:01:01.990 --> 03:01:04.070]  So if the Rapid Rooter is an inch tall,
[03:01:04.070 --> 03:01:05.910]  I go maybe an inch and 1 1⁄8
[03:01:05.910 --> 03:01:08.190]  or maybe an inch and a quarter deep.
[03:01:08.190 --> 03:01:11.590]  Then I get the Rapid Rooter out of the little tray
[03:01:11.590 --> 03:01:13.790]  and I set it gently inside of that hole.
[03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:18.230]  And I do my best to not disrupt any of those roots.
[03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:19.110]  If it's a seedling,
[03:01:19.110 --> 03:01:20.990]  you've probably only got one or two roots
[03:01:20.990 --> 03:01:22.710]  sticking out of that Rapid Rooter.
[03:01:22.710 --> 03:01:23.990]  You need to be very careful.
[03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:26.190]  Gently set that in the soil.
[03:01:26.190 --> 03:01:27.310]  Set it right inside there.
[03:01:27.330 --> 03:01:29.970]  Then backfill that hole really carefully
[03:01:29.970 --> 03:01:31.290]  over that Rapid Rooter.
[03:01:31.290 --> 03:01:32.850]  I like to go right over the top of it
[03:01:32.850 --> 03:01:34.770]  so you can never tell the Rapid Rooter was there
[03:01:34.770 --> 03:01:37.570]  and just a little plant is sticking up out of the soil.
[03:01:37.570 --> 03:01:39.890]  Be really careful if you're working with a seedling.
[03:01:39.890 --> 03:01:42.450]  That one taproot is all it's got to survive through
[03:01:42.450 --> 03:01:43.530]  at this point.
[03:01:43.530 --> 03:01:44.930]  If you're working with a clone,
[03:01:44.930 --> 03:01:47.650]  we still need to be very careful with these roots.
[03:01:47.650 --> 03:01:49.970]  By the way, wear rubber gloves when you're doing all this.
[03:01:49.970 --> 03:01:51.290]  I highly recommend rubber gloves
[03:01:51.290 --> 03:01:52.570]  whenever you're coming in contact,
[03:01:52.570 --> 03:01:53.410]  when you're putting your hands
[03:01:53.410 --> 03:01:54.850]  or your skin in contact with the dirt,
[03:01:54.850 --> 03:01:56.290]  with the roots, with the plants.
[03:01:56.310 --> 03:01:58.430]  Just try to wear rubber gloves if you can
[03:01:58.430 --> 03:01:59.530]  or latex gloves.
[03:01:59.530 --> 03:02:01.910]  Try to glove up whenever possible.
[03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:05.150]  I would still suggest watering that Rapid Rooter seedling
[03:02:05.150 --> 03:02:07.910]  with the spray bottle, just like I recommended before,
[03:02:07.910 --> 03:02:09.350]  until it gets nice and large,
[03:02:09.350 --> 03:02:11.790]  until you're confident that you're not going to drown it.
[03:02:11.790 --> 03:02:13.510]  Just water it with that spray bottle.
[03:02:13.510 --> 03:02:15.510]  Make sure you fully saturate the soil,
[03:02:15.510 --> 03:02:17.630]  but it's easier to not go overboard
[03:02:17.630 --> 03:02:19.390]  when you're spraying with a spray bottle
[03:02:19.390 --> 03:02:21.830]  because you can only spray so much at a time.
[03:02:21.830 --> 03:02:22.790]  If you're a new grower
[03:02:22.790 --> 03:02:24.990]  and you don't have a lot of experience watering plants
[03:02:24.990 --> 03:02:26.370]  and you're new at watering the clones,
[03:02:26.370 --> 03:02:29.090]  don't be afraid to water them with the spray bottle also.
[03:02:29.090 --> 03:02:31.130]  Just get in there and saturate that soil.
[03:02:31.130 --> 03:02:33.530]  Keep spraying until you feel like it's saturated
[03:02:33.530 --> 03:02:36.090]  and then wait until it's fairly dry to water it again.
[03:02:36.090 --> 03:02:38.050]  You'll know when it feels real light when you pick it up,
[03:02:38.050 --> 03:02:39.670]  you'll say, oh, that needs water.
[03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:42.450]  Then just soak it until it's mostly saturated again.
[03:02:42.450 --> 03:02:44.830]  Eventually you'll realize that you're spending too much time
[03:02:44.830 --> 03:02:46.830]  using that spray bottle to water the clones
[03:02:46.830 --> 03:02:49.210]  and you'll start using a more efficient method,
[03:02:49.210 --> 03:02:52.870]  but it's a great way to learn how to not overwater.
[03:02:52.890 --> 03:02:57.090]  So I basically fill my cup with soil, I moisten the soil,
[03:02:57.090 --> 03:02:58.690]  I make a little hole with my fingers
[03:02:58.690 --> 03:03:01.290]  and I set that Rapid Rooter right inside of that hole
[03:03:01.290 --> 03:03:03.710]  really gently, really careful not to damage
[03:03:03.710 --> 03:03:04.950]  any of those new roots.
[03:03:04.950 --> 03:03:08.790]  Then I carefully bury that Rapid Rooter with the moist soil.
[03:03:08.790 --> 03:03:12.050]  Then I put that cup underneath a T5 light.
[03:03:12.050 --> 03:03:14.670]  Again, I like to keep that light eight to 12 inches above it
[03:03:14.670 --> 03:03:15.730]  when they're brand new like this.
[03:03:15.730 --> 03:03:17.830]  I don't want to scorch them, I don't want to burn them.
[03:03:17.830 --> 03:03:19.730]  Then I like to keep the temperature
[03:03:19.730 --> 03:03:22.450]  somewhere between 75 and 85 degrees.
[03:03:22.450 --> 03:03:24.270]  And I try to keep the room fairly humid
[03:03:24.270 --> 03:03:27.610]  when I have new seedlings or young plants in the room.
[03:03:27.610 --> 03:03:30.390]  So that is really quickly how I put my Rapid Rooter
[03:03:30.390 --> 03:03:33.570]  seedlings and clones into cups of soil.
[03:03:33.570 --> 03:03:35.990]  Let's talk next about putting our clones
[03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:40.030]  from an Easy Cloner machine or a Botanicare Turbo Cloner
[03:03:40.030 --> 03:03:41.910]  into cups of soil.
[03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:44.310]  My method for potting these clones into soil
[03:03:44.310 --> 03:03:46.350]  starts the same as potting our seeds
[03:03:46.350 --> 03:03:48.210]  or potting our Rapid Rooters.
[03:03:48.210 --> 03:03:51.110]  I start by filling my cup or my desired container
[03:03:51.130 --> 03:03:54.290]  with Light Warrior or my desired soilless mix
[03:03:54.290 --> 03:03:57.050]  about a quarter inch away from the top.
[03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:59.610]  I then saturate that soil the same as I did
[03:03:59.610 --> 03:04:01.370]  with my other cloning method.
[03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:04.370]  I use about a quarter strength of my Vegetative Newt
[03:04:04.370 --> 03:04:06.690]  and I like to use plenty of microbes.
[03:04:06.690 --> 03:04:11.290]  Then I adjust the pH between 5.8 and 6.2.
[03:04:11.290 --> 03:04:12.530]  Now when we cut these clones,
[03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:16.050]  I said to leave about an inch underneath the neoprene collar
[03:04:16.050 --> 03:04:18.690]  into the water getting hit by that sprayer.
[03:04:18.710 --> 03:04:21.350]  That entire inch should have roots popping out of it.
[03:04:21.350 --> 03:04:23.750]  We should have a nice little mop of roots
[03:04:23.750 --> 03:04:25.630]  before we try to pot these.
[03:04:25.630 --> 03:04:27.510]  So I've got my cup of moistened soil,
[03:04:27.510 --> 03:04:29.310]  I've got a well-rooted clone.
[03:04:29.310 --> 03:04:31.670]  Now I usually grab the cup with my right hand,
[03:04:31.670 --> 03:04:33.550]  I use the pointer finger on my left hand
[03:04:33.550 --> 03:04:36.130]  and I just poke a hole about an inch and a half deep
[03:04:36.130 --> 03:04:37.430]  right into that soil.
[03:04:37.430 --> 03:04:39.270]  Now I may widen that hole up a little bit
[03:04:39.270 --> 03:04:42.270]  depending on the root mass coming off of that clone.
[03:04:42.270 --> 03:04:44.730]  If there are a lot of roots, I need more room.
[03:04:44.730 --> 03:04:48.550]  I don't wanna crowd or crush the roots into that soil.
[03:04:49.410 --> 03:04:51.090]  I like to lower the clone down into the soil
[03:04:51.090 --> 03:04:53.770]  and let those roots spread as far as they can get.
[03:04:53.770 --> 03:04:55.490]  So if you've got something hanging off,
[03:04:55.490 --> 03:04:57.570]  try not to squish them, try not to coil them.
[03:04:57.570 --> 03:04:59.970]  We want to encourage those roots to spread out
[03:04:59.970 --> 03:05:01.490]  as far as they can go.
[03:05:01.490 --> 03:05:02.930]  If you've got a lot of roots,
[03:05:02.930 --> 03:05:06.570]  maybe make a small cone of soil in the bottom of the cup,
[03:05:06.570 --> 03:05:09.170]  a little triangle, so that the roots can hit that triangle
[03:05:09.170 --> 03:05:11.970]  and spread out around that instead of getting into a ball.
[03:05:11.970 --> 03:05:13.290]  We want the roots spread out.
[03:05:13.290 --> 03:05:14.330]  That is really important.
[03:05:14.330 --> 03:05:16.370]  If we tangle them up, if we twist them,
[03:05:16.370 --> 03:05:17.690]  they'll just suffocate themselves
[03:05:17.710 --> 03:05:18.670]  and they will kill the plant
[03:05:18.670 --> 03:05:20.470]  and the clone will not survive at all.
[03:05:20.470 --> 03:05:22.630]  Now, if your roots have gotten excessively long,
[03:05:22.630 --> 03:05:24.470]  I recommend you trim some off.
[03:05:24.470 --> 03:05:27.550]  If they're more than six or seven inches long,
[03:05:27.550 --> 03:05:29.810]  just go ahead and trim the bottoms of those roots off.
[03:05:29.810 --> 03:05:31.430]  Your plants will thank you for it.
[03:05:31.430 --> 03:05:33.710]  They won't have so much root mass twisted up
[03:05:33.710 --> 03:05:36.190]  in the bottom of that cup trying to figure out what to do.
[03:05:36.190 --> 03:05:39.150]  They'll just have a nice thick root mass started
[03:05:39.150 --> 03:05:41.070]  and it works a little bit like topping your plants.
[03:05:41.070 --> 03:05:42.510]  You've just created more sections
[03:05:42.510 --> 03:05:44.750]  for that root zone to branch out from
[03:05:44.750 --> 03:05:46.510]  so your plants will appreciate it.
[03:05:46.530 --> 03:05:48.570]  So you pop that clone up out of the Easy Cloner.
[03:05:48.570 --> 03:05:49.810]  You've got the neoprene disc.
[03:05:49.810 --> 03:05:51.110]  You take the neoprene disc off.
[03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:52.450]  You put that back in the hole
[03:05:52.450 --> 03:05:54.130]  so the water doesn't go spraying anywhere.
[03:05:54.130 --> 03:05:55.770]  You've probably got the cloner turned on
[03:05:55.770 --> 03:05:57.310]  while you're potting the clones.
[03:05:57.310 --> 03:05:59.050]  Then you take that clone
[03:05:59.050 --> 03:06:00.790]  and you just set it right inside that hole
[03:06:00.790 --> 03:06:02.330]  that you've created in the soil.
[03:06:02.330 --> 03:06:03.610]  But as you lower it down into there,
[03:06:03.610 --> 03:06:05.210]  try to spread the roots out.
[03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:06.450]  If they're just short and stubby,
[03:06:06.450 --> 03:06:07.930]  they're gonna go the direction they wanna go.
[03:06:07.930 --> 03:06:08.850]  If they're getting long enough
[03:06:08.850 --> 03:06:10.970]  to where you can stretch them or move them
[03:06:10.970 --> 03:06:12.850]  and encourage them which direction to go,
[03:06:12.850 --> 03:06:14.890]  try to make them spread out like an umbrella.
[03:06:14.910 --> 03:06:17.150]  We wanna get them nice and far.
[03:06:17.150 --> 03:06:18.590]  If they're really long,
[03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:20.990]  you can put soil in the cup,
[03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:23.070]  lower some of the roots down into the cup,
[03:06:23.070 --> 03:06:25.390]  then sprinkle more soil on top of that,
[03:06:25.390 --> 03:06:27.350]  then lower more roots down into the cup
[03:06:27.350 --> 03:06:29.710]  and then sprinkle more soil on top of that.
[03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:31.830]  Then no matter how much soil you use,
[03:06:31.830 --> 03:06:33.310]  no matter how long the roots are,
[03:06:33.310 --> 03:06:36.390]  we need to bury that clone deep enough into this cup
[03:06:36.390 --> 03:06:38.670]  to give it some support to stand straight up.
[03:06:38.670 --> 03:06:40.510]  We need to get the soil tight enough around it
[03:06:40.510 --> 03:06:41.990]  and get it deep enough in there
[03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:44.570]  to get the clone to support itself and stand straight up.
[03:06:45.230 --> 03:06:46.070]  But at the same time,
[03:06:46.070 --> 03:06:48.030]  we need to not bury it so deep
[03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:51.110]  that we cause root rot on that short stem that is there.
[03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:54.710]  So we put one inch of it underneath the neoprene disc
[03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:55.830]  getting sprayed by the water.
[03:06:55.830 --> 03:06:57.930]  So we've got roots about one inch,
[03:06:57.930 --> 03:07:00.670]  then that neoprene disc is about a quarter of an inch deep.
[03:07:00.670 --> 03:07:02.630]  So I would say probably plant it
[03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:04.190]  somewhere between one and a quarter
[03:07:04.190 --> 03:07:06.990]  and one and a half inches deep into your medium.
[03:07:06.990 --> 03:07:08.390]  Now we've already moistened the soil
[03:07:08.390 --> 03:07:10.030]  so the nutrients are in there.
[03:07:10.030 --> 03:07:12.990]  The next thing to do is to move our potted clones
[03:07:12.990 --> 03:07:14.570]  underneath a T5 light.
[03:07:14.570 --> 03:07:16.530]  Again, for freshly potted plants,
[03:07:16.530 --> 03:07:19.890]  I like to keep that T5 about eight to 12 inches away.
[03:07:19.890 --> 03:07:22.850]  I will lower that light as the plants get stronger.
[03:07:22.850 --> 03:07:24.930]  I just don't want to move them right under there right away
[03:07:24.930 --> 03:07:26.370]  and scorch them and burn them
[03:07:26.370 --> 03:07:28.770]  and give them the opportunity to stress out.
[03:07:28.770 --> 03:07:30.050]  For these new baby clones,
[03:07:30.050 --> 03:07:33.850]  I like to keep the temperature between 75 and 85 degrees
[03:07:33.850 --> 03:07:35.570]  and I do like high humidity.
[03:07:35.570 --> 03:07:37.770]  It depends on how much airflow I've got in the room.
[03:07:37.770 --> 03:07:38.890]  It depends on my environment.
[03:07:38.890 --> 03:07:40.330]  It depends on the situation.
[03:07:40.330 --> 03:07:41.650]  If I've got plenty of airflow,
[03:07:41.650 --> 03:07:43.190]  if I can have air exchange,
[03:07:43.190 --> 03:07:44.870]  I will put higher humidity in the room.
[03:07:44.870 --> 03:07:46.510]  If I feel like there's not a lot of airflow
[03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:47.870]  and it will create problems,
[03:07:47.870 --> 03:07:50.830]  I will reduce the humidity accordingly.
[03:07:50.830 --> 03:07:52.190]  I know I keep stressing it,
[03:07:52.190 --> 03:07:53.990]  but the most important thing to think about
[03:07:53.990 --> 03:07:55.830]  when you are potting these clones
[03:07:55.830 --> 03:07:57.990]  from the EZCloner, from the TurboCloner,
[03:07:57.990 --> 03:08:01.470]  is to not let those dangly roots wrap up on themselves.
[03:08:01.470 --> 03:08:02.350]  Don't let them bind.
[03:08:02.350 --> 03:08:03.670]  Don't let them smother themselves.
[03:08:03.670 --> 03:08:05.730]  Don't let them suffocate themselves.
[03:08:05.730 --> 03:08:08.350]  These cloning machines can make roots explode.
[03:08:08.350 --> 03:08:09.630]  You'll look in there on day five
[03:08:09.630 --> 03:08:10.670]  and you won't have any roots.
[03:08:10.670 --> 03:08:13.090]  You'll look in there on day six, you'll be getting roots.
[03:08:13.090 --> 03:08:14.210]  You'll go away for the weekend.
[03:08:14.210 --> 03:08:16.130]  You'll come back over the weekend on Monday.
[03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:18.010]  The roots are hanging down into the water.
[03:08:18.010 --> 03:08:20.250]  They go crazy very quickly.
[03:08:20.250 --> 03:08:21.530]  You will see what I'm talking about
[03:08:21.530 --> 03:08:23.010]  when you get it dialed in.
[03:08:23.010 --> 03:08:25.690]  Don't take those fat clones with big, crazy roots
[03:08:25.690 --> 03:08:27.450]  and kill them by suffocating them,
[03:08:27.450 --> 03:08:29.730]  by coiling them up in your soil.
[03:08:29.730 --> 03:08:31.070]  All right, so at this point,
[03:08:31.070 --> 03:08:32.670]  we have got a bunch of seedlings
[03:08:32.670 --> 03:08:35.570]  or a bunch of clones in small pots or cups.
[03:08:35.570 --> 03:08:37.530]  We've got them underneath T5 lights
[03:08:37.530 --> 03:08:39.090]  or whatever light you've got available.
[03:08:39.090 --> 03:08:40.650]  Maybe you've got an LED.
[03:08:41.510 --> 03:08:44.110]  Maybe you've got a small HPS, maybe a 250 or a 400.
[03:08:44.110 --> 03:08:45.830]  If you're using something larger that works,
[03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:47.110]  just keep it further away.
[03:08:47.110 --> 03:08:48.750]  Just raise it up real high.
[03:08:48.750 --> 03:08:50.610]  So we've got it under an acceptable light.
[03:08:50.610 --> 03:08:53.030]  We've got it in a desirable climate,
[03:08:53.030 --> 03:08:55.430]  which is around 75 to 85 degrees
[03:08:55.430 --> 03:08:57.070]  with the appropriate humidity.
[03:08:57.070 --> 03:09:00.290]  Hopefully you've got somewhere between 50 and 75% humidity
[03:09:00.290 --> 03:09:01.670]  for your small plants.
[03:09:01.670 --> 03:09:04.310]  I would suggest either 24 hours on
[03:09:04.310 --> 03:09:06.710]  or possibly 20 on and four off.
[03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:09.050]  Or a lot of people like to do 18 hours on
[03:09:09.070 --> 03:09:12.630]  and six hours off for our new small plants.
[03:09:12.630 --> 03:09:15.950]  Also, I would recommend a light fan on these plants.
[03:09:15.950 --> 03:09:18.150]  Just a fan to keep the air moving around them
[03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:21.150]  will prevent the plants from getting leggy and stretchy.
[03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:24.150]  And I think it just makes tougher, more robust plants
[03:09:24.150 --> 03:09:26.030]  when you put a little breeze on them.
[03:09:26.030 --> 03:09:29.790]  So at this point, the clones are now in our small veg phase.
[03:09:29.790 --> 03:09:32.830]  In a very short time, those seedlings will catch up
[03:09:32.830 --> 03:09:35.090]  to what I consider the small veg phase,
[03:09:35.090 --> 03:09:37.770]  which is when they're about six inches tall
[03:09:37.770 --> 03:09:39.710]  and they've got a couple of nice sets of leaves
[03:09:39.710 --> 03:09:43.250]  and they can start taking small veg nutrients.
[03:09:43.250 --> 03:09:47.230]  I plan on doing a complete episode on small veg
[03:09:47.230 --> 03:09:48.990]  here in the very near future.
[03:09:48.990 --> 03:09:51.390]  That episode will include recommended light cycles
[03:09:51.390 --> 03:09:52.610]  for your veg plant.
[03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:55.430]  That episode will include recommended nutrient schedules
[03:09:55.430 --> 03:09:56.710]  for your veg plant.
[03:09:56.710 --> 03:09:59.190]  I'll also talk about optimal environmental conditions
[03:09:59.190 --> 03:10:00.990]  for your small veg plants.
[03:10:00.990 --> 03:10:02.850]  Then we'll talk about transplanting our plants
[03:10:02.850 --> 03:10:04.190]  into their finishing pots
[03:10:04.190 --> 03:10:06.190]  and we will consider that large veg.
[03:10:06.210 --> 03:10:10.290]  And then we will begin to talk about our large veg phase.
[03:10:10.290 --> 03:10:12.330]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are having as much fun
[03:10:12.330 --> 03:10:14.650]  with these grow lessons as I am.
[03:10:14.650 --> 03:10:16.010]  I would love to hear your feedback.

[03:10:45.070 --> 03:10:46.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you again
[03:10:46.670 --> 03:10:48.070]  for listening to the podcast.
[03:10:48.070 --> 03:10:50.090]  I know this was sort of a short episode,
[03:10:50.090 --> 03:10:51.790]  but I feel like I did a good lesson.
[03:10:51.790 --> 03:10:54.310]  I taught you well how to transplant your new babies.
[03:10:54.310 --> 03:10:55.710]  I feel like there was not a lot of fluff
[03:10:55.710 --> 03:10:57.370]  or a lot of BS to filter through.
[03:10:57.370 --> 03:10:59.430]  I feel like a lot of people can learn from this one
[03:10:59.430 --> 03:11:00.310]  and that is the point.
[03:11:00.330 --> 03:11:02.490]  So short and sweet, right to the point.
[03:11:02.490 --> 03:11:03.730]  We served our purpose.
[03:11:03.730 --> 03:11:05.170]  I think Mike is on his way over.
[03:11:05.170 --> 03:11:07.330]  So we will record a long and rambly episode
[03:11:07.330 --> 03:11:09.930]  that will make up for the short episode I did today.
[03:11:09.930 --> 03:11:11.890]  You guys, I want to thank you again for listening.
[03:11:11.890 --> 03:11:13.330]  I would appreciate it if you find me
