[00:10.110 --> 00:12.030]  All right, here we go.
[00:12.030 --> 00:13.710]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:13.710 --> 00:14.710]  I'm your host.
[00:14.710 --> 00:16.430]  My friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:16.430 --> 00:21.470]  This is episode 705 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.470 --> 00:25.790]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about some of the labels we see on seed packages.
[00:25.790 --> 00:27.350]  What does that S1 mean?
[00:27.350 --> 00:28.710]  What does RBX mean?
[00:28.710 --> 00:31.750]  What do all of those crazy letters mean on our packages?
[00:31.750 --> 00:35.430]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great
[00:35.430 --> 00:39.810]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:39.810 --> 00:43.250]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[00:43.250 --> 00:44.690]  my friend Quazi.
[00:44.690 --> 00:47.330]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Spherical Glassworks.
[00:47.330 --> 00:51.050]  I want to send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to my friend Danny Potts.
[00:51.050 --> 00:53.570]  Let's send a thank you shout out to the new old guy.
[00:53.570 --> 00:56.450]  Let's send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to G7.
[00:56.450 --> 00:59.090]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Brohan78.

[01:18.250 --> 01:22.130]  And then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:22.130 --> 01:24.570]  to PacNorthwestDan.
[01:24.570 --> 01:29.470]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:49.210 --> 01:53.830]  I want to start off by sending a big thank you to everybody who has helped get the show
[01:53.830 --> 01:56.170]  closer to 10,000 subscribers.
[01:56.170 --> 01:57.170]  That's right.
[01:57.170 --> 02:00.210]  All I asked for for Christmas was 10,000 YouTube subscribers.
[02:00.210 --> 02:02.850]  We didn't quite reach the goal, but we got very close.
[02:02.850 --> 02:05.490]  I've been noticing a lot more subscribers.
[02:05.490 --> 02:09.610]  I've been noticing a lot more interaction, a lot more likes, and a lot more comments.
[02:09.610 --> 02:11.490]  A lot more comments right away on the videos.
[02:11.490 --> 02:15.890]  When a new video comes out, you guys are watching it, you are commenting right away.
[02:15.890 --> 02:16.890]  Big thanks.
[02:16.890 --> 02:17.890]  I do appreciate that.
[02:17.890 --> 02:21.730]  Thank you for all the support, the interaction, the words of encouragement.
[02:21.730 --> 02:23.810]  All of that stuff does mean a lot to me.
[02:23.810 --> 02:24.970]  I do appreciate it.

[02:37.370 --> 02:40.210]  Send me those questions, those corrections, the comments, the concerns.
[02:40.210 --> 02:42.050]  I will get that into the show.
[02:42.050 --> 02:44.690]  Thank you once again for all of that interaction.
[02:44.690 --> 02:45.930]  I do appreciate it.
[02:45.930 --> 02:46.930]  All right.
[02:46.930 --> 02:48.610]  I don't want to ramble too much here at the start of the show.
[02:48.610 --> 02:51.490]  I feel like we could talk for a long time about this topic.
[02:51.490 --> 02:53.570]  So let's jump right into this email.
[02:53.570 --> 02:55.250]  This one came from Patreon.
[02:55.250 --> 02:59.010]  It came from our friend Luke, and it goes a lot like this.
[02:59.010 --> 03:04.570]  It says, hey Rasta Jeff, I just finished the podcast, the podcast about backcross.
[03:04.570 --> 03:06.730]  Would you do another one on the same topic?
[03:06.730 --> 03:12.650]  Just go a little further, like talking about an RBX1 and keep crossing it to itself, or
[03:12.650 --> 03:19.570]  better yet, crossing it back to its mom, or an RBX1S1 to a P1, or crossing that to an
[03:19.570 --> 03:21.330]  S3 to an S1.
[03:21.330 --> 03:24.010]  It looks like you just grabbed a bunch of seed packs and saw those letters on there
[03:24.010 --> 03:26.330]  and just decided to throw a bunch of those in the email.
[03:26.330 --> 03:27.330]  I know what you're saying.
[03:27.330 --> 03:28.370]  I know what you're asking for.
[03:28.410 --> 03:30.210]  We can delve into this.
[03:30.210 --> 03:33.810]  It says, I love the show and all of the knowledge it brings us.
[03:33.810 --> 03:36.450]  You can say my name, say my name, say my name.
[03:36.450 --> 03:38.890]  Big shout out to my buddy Luke61.
[03:38.890 --> 03:42.410]  Thank you for the great question and for the continued Patreon support.
[03:42.410 --> 03:43.530]  This is a good question.
[03:43.530 --> 03:45.890]  We see this on a lot of seed packs.
[03:45.890 --> 03:48.450]  I am a seed maker, seed seller.
[03:48.450 --> 03:51.050]  I try to label my seed packs quite clearly.
[03:51.050 --> 03:57.930]  I see a lot of other seed makers and seed breeders and seed sellers creating really confusing
[03:58.010 --> 04:01.650]  seed labels and I see a lot of arbitrary things out there.
[04:01.650 --> 04:05.690]  Let's try to talk a little bit about some of those letters and labels that we see on
[04:05.690 --> 04:08.490]  our seed packages.
[04:08.490 --> 04:12.650]  Luke did ask about some very specific lettering in here, but I do want to start with a little
[04:12.650 --> 04:14.010]  bit of a foundation.
[04:14.010 --> 04:15.810]  What can we learn without a foundation?
[04:15.810 --> 04:18.010]  Let's start from the beginning.
[04:18.010 --> 04:22.370]  Most of the time, we are going to see things like F1 or F2.
[04:22.370 --> 04:26.090]  If we see the letter F in there, that means filial generation.
[04:26.090 --> 04:31.770]  Most of the time, if you see an F, it is going to be a regular male-female non-feminized
[04:31.770 --> 04:32.770]  seed.
[04:32.770 --> 04:38.570]  That will not always be the case, but most of the time, a F1 and F2 will be a regular
[04:38.570 --> 04:40.530]  male-female seed.
[04:40.530 --> 04:43.330]  We will talk about S1s and R1s in a moment.
[04:43.330 --> 04:45.090]  Those are also F1s.
[04:45.090 --> 04:48.130]  We'll talk more about that in a minute, but I wanted to just throw that out there.
[04:48.130 --> 04:54.570]  An S1 is also an F1, but an F1 is not always an S1.
[04:54.570 --> 04:58.370]  That will make sense in just a minute, but I wanted to make sure to put that out there.
[04:58.370 --> 05:02.810]  When we take two plants that are vastly different and we breed them together, we are now making
[05:02.810 --> 05:04.210]  an F1 hybrid.
[05:04.210 --> 05:08.250]  If those plants are too close together, we haven't done our proper breeding, that is
[05:08.250 --> 05:09.490]  a polyhybrid.
[05:09.490 --> 05:13.050]  That is a whole other podcast conversation that we could talk about in the future.
[05:13.050 --> 05:18.450]  I would love your feedback and input on talking about the difference in F1s and polyhybrids.
[05:18.450 --> 05:20.530]  That can be a fun conversation.
[05:20.530 --> 05:25.970]  Most of the time, if we see the letter F, that is indicating filial generation.
[05:25.970 --> 05:30.810]  An F1 means it is the first time that that has been crossed, that golden goat and daybreaker
[05:30.810 --> 05:32.050]  have been crossed.
[05:32.050 --> 05:34.370]  We just made a rise F1.
[05:34.370 --> 05:36.810]  It is the first filial generation.
[05:36.810 --> 05:42.990]  Now, if I were to find a male and a female from that first batch of seeds, we take the
[05:42.990 --> 05:47.110]  daybreaker and the golden goat, we breed them together, it makes seeds.
[05:47.110 --> 05:48.470]  That is an F1.
[05:48.470 --> 05:53.070]  If I grow out those seeds and find an awesome male and an awesome female and cross those
[05:53.070 --> 05:55.950]  together, we have now made F2.
[05:55.950 --> 05:59.470]  We are making filial generation number two.
[05:59.470 --> 06:04.570]  As long as we keep repeating that process, we are moving forward in what is called the
[06:04.570 --> 06:06.390]  filial generation.
[06:06.390 --> 06:11.350]  We take the plants that come out of F2, we grow those, we find a solid male and a solid
[06:11.350 --> 06:13.570]  female, we breed those together.
[06:13.570 --> 06:15.750]  We have now made the F3.
[06:15.750 --> 06:21.010]  Repeat that process all the way up to F6 and you will make totally, completely stable plants
[06:21.010 --> 06:26.770]  that look like clones of each other if you have done the selection process properly.
[06:26.770 --> 06:31.630]  That is moving forward in filial generations, F1, F2.
[06:31.630 --> 06:33.090]  That should make sense.
[06:33.090 --> 06:34.250]  Just keep going number wise.
[06:34.250 --> 06:38.750]  As long as we are pulling from that batch of seeds and not adulterating and going backwards
[06:38.750 --> 06:43.330]  or bringing in new plants anywhere, you are moving forward with the filial generation.
[06:44.090 --> 06:46.890]  You take a male and a female, you make new seeds, that is F1.
[06:46.890 --> 06:50.890]  You take a male and a female from that batch and now you breed them together, you make
[06:50.890 --> 06:51.890]  F2.
[06:51.890 --> 06:54.490]  You take a male and a female from that batch, you make F3.
[06:54.490 --> 06:56.510]  I think I've made that clear.
[06:56.510 --> 06:58.610]  Now let's talk about where do we go from there.
[06:58.610 --> 07:00.050]  Let's jump into the back cross.
[07:00.050 --> 07:02.930]  I did talk about back cross in a previous episode.
[07:02.930 --> 07:04.490]  We will talk about that.
[07:04.490 --> 07:05.490]  The back cross.
[07:05.490 --> 07:09.490]  If I were to take the golden goat and the daybreaker and breed them together, we have
[07:09.490 --> 07:11.350]  now made an F1.
[07:11.390 --> 07:15.430]  If I were to take the male plant or we could do the female, but we're going to stick with
[07:15.430 --> 07:17.710]  the male for my topic here.
[07:17.710 --> 07:22.750]  If I were to find a male plant out of that F1 batch and pollinate the original golden
[07:22.750 --> 07:25.910]  goat girl again, that is a back cross.
[07:25.910 --> 07:30.110]  If you use one of the plants that you used in the original, if you go backwards, if you
[07:30.110 --> 07:33.810]  cross back to one of the original parents, you are back crossing.
[07:33.810 --> 07:37.830]  The reason we would do that is to stabilize and isolate the traits of that original parent
[07:37.830 --> 07:38.830]  plant.
[07:38.830 --> 07:40.870]  That's the focus of the back cross podcast.
[07:40.870 --> 07:44.510]  You can listen to that to learn all about back crossing.
[07:44.510 --> 07:46.710]  So an F1 is when we make new stuff.
[07:46.710 --> 07:52.070]  F2, F3 is when we breed that further down the line with itself, not back to another
[07:52.070 --> 07:53.990]  plant but forward with itself.
[07:53.990 --> 07:57.470]  Back cross would be going back to one of the original parents.
[07:57.470 --> 08:00.710]  No matter what generation you're using, you can always back cross.
[08:00.710 --> 08:04.510]  You can do an F3 back to one of the original parents.
[08:04.510 --> 08:06.590]  You could do an F4 back to the parent.
[08:06.590 --> 08:07.990]  It would still be a back cross.
[08:08.150 --> 08:10.910]  You may label that golden goat.
[08:10.910 --> 08:11.910]  How would you label it?
[08:11.910 --> 08:16.510]  Golden goat to a rise F4 back cross.
[08:16.510 --> 08:17.510]  That's how that would be.
[08:17.510 --> 08:21.170]  Because if you use the F4, you'd want to indicate that the F4 was used in there.
[08:21.170 --> 08:23.110]  A lot of people just want to know that information.
[08:23.110 --> 08:28.310]  A lot of this is just, a lot of it isn't important if you're just growing this and enjoying it.
[08:28.310 --> 08:33.470]  A lot of this is important if you're going to make seeds and sell or share them or if
[08:33.470 --> 08:35.830]  you're just really trying to document history of cannabis.
[08:35.830 --> 08:39.110]  A lot of this won't be important to a smoker or a consumer.
[08:39.110 --> 08:40.750]  It wouldn't matter to you at all.
[08:40.750 --> 08:44.830]  But if you're kind of nerding out and creating things and wanting to know history and how
[08:44.830 --> 08:48.470]  to make labels and how to understand the labels better, this would help you out.
[08:48.470 --> 08:49.470]  All right.
[08:49.470 --> 08:50.470]  So we've done F1.
[08:50.470 --> 08:52.390]  I feel like we've covered back cross.
[08:52.390 --> 08:57.870]  Now let's talk about R and S. R and S is when people get confused.
[08:57.870 --> 08:59.510]  I've talked about this before.
[08:59.510 --> 09:04.830]  The easiest way for me to explain this is reversal is when we are making feminized seeds.
[09:04.830 --> 09:08.230]  We will take a female plant and treat it with the solution.
[09:08.230 --> 09:11.830]  Now we have reversed that plant to become a pollen donor.
[09:11.830 --> 09:15.390]  We're not going to label, we're not going to label that plant as a male.
[09:15.390 --> 09:19.450]  We're going to label that plant as a pollen donor because it is not a male.
[09:19.450 --> 09:21.670]  It is also not a hermaphrodite.
[09:21.670 --> 09:26.990]  When you guys talk about feminized seeds and feminized plants and reversing plants, stop
[09:26.990 --> 09:29.910]  saying hermaphrodite because it is not a hermaphrodite.
[09:29.910 --> 09:33.110]  If it were an intersex plant, I would not use it.
[09:33.110 --> 09:37.750]  I am using a solid female plant that is treated with a solution to create pollen.
[09:37.750 --> 09:39.170]  It is not a hermaphrodite.
[09:39.170 --> 09:40.670]  It is not intersex.
[09:40.670 --> 09:42.110]  That is my rant on that.
[09:42.110 --> 09:43.630]  Let me stay on focus.
[09:43.630 --> 09:47.050]  I would take a female plant and treat it with a solution.
[09:47.050 --> 09:49.030]  Now it will create pollen.
[09:49.030 --> 09:51.750]  That pollen is now feminized pollen.
[09:51.750 --> 09:56.550]  What I do with that pollen dictates if I am creating S or R generations.
[09:56.550 --> 09:57.950]  Now let's talk about that.
[09:57.950 --> 10:01.230]  An R generation would be a reversal.
[10:01.230 --> 10:06.710]  If I reverse that plant and put that pollen on any other cultivar other than itself, we
[10:06.710 --> 10:08.550]  have just made a reversal.
[10:08.550 --> 10:10.670]  That is an R1.
[10:10.670 --> 10:13.550]  Let's talk about Lemon Jeffrey as an R1.
[10:13.550 --> 10:19.310]  Lemon Jeffrey is a reversed golden goat pollinated a lemon skunk.
[10:19.310 --> 10:23.290]  So we got a reverse golden goat, took the pollen, put that on lemon skunk.
[10:23.290 --> 10:26.110]  The offspring from that is the Lemon Jeffrey.
[10:26.110 --> 10:27.710]  That is an R1.
[10:27.710 --> 10:30.850]  I used reversed pollen, put it on a different plant.
[10:30.970 --> 10:32.290]  We made an R1.
[10:32.290 --> 10:34.490]  That is an S1.
[10:34.490 --> 10:41.370]  That is an S1 because it is the first creation, the first filial generation of this plant.
[10:41.370 --> 10:46.410]  But I would use R1 to indicate to my customers, my consumers, the people buying these seeds,
[10:46.410 --> 10:50.530]  the people looking at the website, that this is a feminized creation.
[10:50.530 --> 10:54.370]  That is why I would go with the R in that indication to show you it's been reversed
[10:54.370 --> 10:57.390]  pollen and it is the first time we have done that.
[10:57.390 --> 10:58.930]  It is an R1.
[10:59.010 --> 11:00.970]  Now, where does the S come in?
[11:00.970 --> 11:02.090]  You'll never forget this.
[11:02.090 --> 11:05.250]  It sounds crass, but I promise you'll never forget.
[11:05.250 --> 11:10.690]  The letter S in that indication stands for selfed, which means that plant basically fucked
[11:10.690 --> 11:12.110]  itself.
[11:12.110 --> 11:17.450]  If we were to take golden goat, reverse the golden goat, pollinate another clone of the
[11:17.450 --> 11:22.010]  golden goat, we are making golden goat S1.
[11:22.010 --> 11:24.450]  That is a golden goat selfed plant.
[11:24.450 --> 11:28.410]  There's nothing else in that golden goat to adulterate those golden goat genetics.
[11:28.410 --> 11:33.650]  I took a golden goat plant, I reversed it, put another golden goat plant up there, and
[11:33.650 --> 11:35.290]  it basically fucked itself.
[11:35.290 --> 11:39.730]  That sounds crass, but I promise you're going to remember that that is a selfed plant.
[11:39.730 --> 11:45.050]  That is when a plant is flipped, reversed, pollinated itself, and fucks itself and makes
[11:45.050 --> 11:46.970]  seeds of itself.
[11:46.970 --> 11:53.810]  That is a feminized golden goat S1, also an F1.
[11:54.330 --> 12:00.010]  Basically, when we make feminized seeds, if it is a reversal, if the pollen from the donor
[12:00.010 --> 12:04.830]  plant is used on any other plants, that is an R1, that is a reversal.
[12:04.830 --> 12:08.690]  If that feminized pollen is put back on the same plant that it was reversed from, the
[12:08.690 --> 12:11.810]  same cultivar, it would be a different clone, but it's the same plant.
[12:11.810 --> 12:13.370]  Basically, you see what I'm saying?
[12:13.370 --> 12:16.810]  That would be an S because it is selfing itself.
[12:16.810 --> 12:18.130]  You'll never forget that.
[12:18.130 --> 12:19.850]  It just selfed itself.
[12:19.850 --> 12:22.010]  It's been reversed or selfed.
[12:22.010 --> 12:25.410]  Let's talk more about some of the details which you asked.
[12:25.410 --> 12:26.410]  You said P1.
[12:26.410 --> 12:28.610]  You included the letters P1 in here.
[12:28.610 --> 12:31.210]  P1, P means parent.
[12:31.210 --> 12:34.930]  P just stands for parent, is what P is in that equation.
[12:34.930 --> 12:35.930]  Let's talk a little bit more.
[12:35.930 --> 12:41.890]  You said, can you talk about taking it further, like taking an RBX1, which is a reversed bat
[12:41.890 --> 12:42.890]  cross one.
[12:42.890 --> 12:45.690]  Let's talk about what is a reversed bat cross one.
[12:45.690 --> 12:48.650]  Let's decipher this code.
[12:48.690 --> 12:52.490]  I'm going to pick a plant to give an example with this RBX1.
[12:52.490 --> 12:55.770]  I'm just going to pick blueberry cookies because I work with that a lot.
[12:55.770 --> 12:59.890]  It does make great reversals, great fem seeds, great outcrosses.
[12:59.890 --> 13:06.110]  Let me try to explain a little bit about what this RBX1 is without having the actual seed
[13:06.110 --> 13:07.370]  package in front of me.
[13:07.370 --> 13:11.410]  I don't know what they did there and I don't know where you got the idea.
[13:11.410 --> 13:14.090]  I'm going to try to explain this to the best of my knowledge.
[13:14.090 --> 13:18.050]  I have a good idea who you're reading these letters from.
[13:18.450 --> 13:24.010]  RBX1, the R indicates that that is a reversal, so this will be feminized.
[13:24.010 --> 13:29.890]  BX1 indicates that there was a plant that was selected and bred back to its parent for
[13:29.890 --> 13:31.570]  a desired trait.
[13:31.570 --> 13:35.050]  Without knowing a little bit more history of this, I don't know exactly which order
[13:35.050 --> 13:40.010]  it happened, but it sounds like we took a plant and reversed it and put that pollen
[13:40.010 --> 13:45.250]  back on one of its parents is possibly what happened here because it's a reversal, which
[13:45.250 --> 13:47.970]  is an R, so I would assume we've got the plant.
[13:47.970 --> 13:49.530]  We treated it with a solution.
[13:49.530 --> 13:51.050]  That plant made pollen.
[13:51.050 --> 13:56.730]  Then we put that pollen back onto one of its parents would be my assumption here.
[13:56.730 --> 14:01.210]  Again, without the seed pack, without more details, without more of the story, all I
[14:01.210 --> 14:07.610]  can do is make assumptions and try to decipher this code here, but RBX1 would be if you took
[14:07.610 --> 14:12.610]  a plant and reversed it and put that pollen from that plant back onto one of its parents
[14:12.610 --> 14:16.010]  would be an easy way to explain that one.
[14:16.010 --> 14:17.770]  Let me try to think of how that would go.
[14:18.570 --> 14:23.170]  We would take a blueberry cookies plant and then we would reverse that and we would pollinate
[14:23.170 --> 14:24.170]  another plant.
[14:24.170 --> 14:25.810]  It doesn't matter which plant that is.
[14:25.810 --> 14:30.730]  We'll say that we pollinated strawberry fields and we just made the Raphael.
[14:30.730 --> 14:34.850]  Now we've got blueberry cookies to strawberry fields makes Raphael.
[14:34.850 --> 14:38.450]  Now at this point, we've got to do a back cross, so I think we're going to take the
[14:38.450 --> 14:42.630]  Raphael plant, which is the blueberry cookies and the strawberry fields.
[14:42.630 --> 14:47.170]  We're going to treat that with a solution, which will make that plant make pollen.
[14:47.170 --> 14:52.330]  Now we can take that pollen and put it back on either the blueberry cookies or the strawberry
[14:52.330 --> 14:54.970]  fields plant, or we could do the opposite.
[14:54.970 --> 15:00.050]  We could reverse the blueberry cookies or the strawberry fields and put that to the
[15:00.050 --> 15:05.090]  Raphael, but I'm not sure which order they did it because I don't have more details,
[15:05.090 --> 15:07.450]  but that kind of gives me an idea of what happened.
[15:07.450 --> 15:10.930]  There was a reversal and something went back to a parent.
[15:10.930 --> 15:13.970]  Without more of the equation, I can't really do the math.
[15:13.970 --> 15:18.130]  There's algebra to be done here and I don't have the other letters.
[15:18.130 --> 15:20.930]  So that is RBX1.
[15:20.930 --> 15:26.090]  Then you wrote S1 crossed to P1.
[15:26.090 --> 15:30.690]  So if we selected a keeper from that batch of feminized seeds and put it back to one
[15:30.690 --> 15:36.530]  of the original parents is what it sounds like, that would have to be feminized because
[15:36.530 --> 15:41.610]  we're making a reversal in S1 that's a feminized project back to one of the original parents.
[15:41.610 --> 15:43.930]  That would be a femme project.
[15:44.890 --> 15:46.010]  Is that an S1?
[15:46.010 --> 15:47.650]  That's kind of a back cross right there.
[15:47.650 --> 15:50.330]  You're doing a feminized back to one of its parents.
[15:50.330 --> 15:52.770]  That's a really good way to lock in certain traits.
[15:52.770 --> 15:57.250]  If you find a feminized seed with the trait that you're looking for, cross it back to
[15:57.250 --> 16:02.610]  one of his parents, that is a, or her parents, that is a really good way to lock in and isolate
[16:02.610 --> 16:03.930]  traits that you're looking for.
[16:03.930 --> 16:05.450]  That would work really well.
[16:05.450 --> 16:10.410]  Or crossing an S3 to an S1.
[16:10.410 --> 16:15.970]  If you're doing an S3 to an S1 that is the same line, that is a back cross.
[16:15.970 --> 16:21.050]  If you're doing an S3 to an S1, like a selfed plant, let's just say that we got a golden
[16:21.050 --> 16:22.210]  goat.
[16:22.210 --> 16:23.210]  Where are we?
[16:23.210 --> 16:24.210]  S3.
[16:24.210 --> 16:25.290]  S3 just sounds weird.
[16:25.290 --> 16:27.250]  I don't think anybody even does S3.
[16:27.250 --> 16:30.330]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with anybody that does an S3.
[16:30.330 --> 16:31.330]  I've seen S2s.
[16:31.330 --> 16:34.330]  I'm not sure that Collins go into S3 or not.
[16:34.330 --> 16:39.290]  But so let's just say that we took a golden goat and selfed it and then that golden goat
[16:39.290 --> 16:42.770]  and selfed it and did it again and did it again to the third generation.
[16:42.770 --> 16:46.810]  And then if we just took a different plant that was an S1, like a lemon skunk S1 and
[16:46.810 --> 16:51.130]  crossed those, you're just making another F1 that is just another polyhybrid.
[16:51.130 --> 16:54.290]  It would be an S1, an F1, or a polyhybrid.
[16:54.290 --> 16:58.230]  Probably fit in all of those categories.
[16:58.230 --> 17:03.650]  But honestly, technically, most of these labels don't really matter unless you are the breeder,
[17:03.650 --> 17:07.690]  unless you really want to know the details about how these plants were made, what came
[17:07.690 --> 17:09.290]  from these plants.
[17:09.290 --> 17:13.390]  If you're that passionate and that curious about the crosses and the history, I'm sure
[17:13.390 --> 17:17.610]  that a little bit of research on the website of the breeder that made those seeds will
[17:17.610 --> 17:19.890]  give you a lot of clues of what they've been doing.
[17:19.890 --> 17:24.570]  You can see the history of a lot of my crosses and where things have gone.
[17:24.570 --> 17:28.010]  Just if you looked at like the current stuff, you could see what's been crossed to add up
[17:28.010 --> 17:30.110]  to what we've got going on now.
[17:30.110 --> 17:34.050]  So if you did a little bit of diving, a little bit of investigation, you could probably reverse
[17:34.130 --> 17:38.650]  engineer most of the crosses that you see on a lot of popular breeders' websites.
[17:38.650 --> 17:41.610]  I think I understand where you're getting these ideas.
[17:41.610 --> 17:46.410]  My friend Colin at the Ethos Collective at Ethos Seeds likes to use the Rs, the Ss, the
[17:46.410 --> 17:48.210]  Bx.
[17:48.210 --> 17:54.950]  And honestly, these labels are kind of being bastardized and readjusted and reinvented
[17:54.950 --> 17:56.650]  to suit the cannabis industry.
[17:56.650 --> 18:02.130]  We're not really using them the technical way that they were meant to be done in agriculture
[18:02.130 --> 18:03.290]  and horticulture.
[18:03.530 --> 18:06.490]  I really don't even think that Bx is the correct term.
[18:06.490 --> 18:09.130]  My friend F1 Pete, I could see a little vein in his head.
[18:09.130 --> 18:12.310]  His head tries to rupture every time we say Bx.
[18:12.310 --> 18:16.450]  So we may start adjusting and correcting that to Bc because it is backcross.
[18:16.450 --> 18:18.130]  Again, I said Bx.
[18:18.130 --> 18:21.890]  We use that because when we're listing crosses, we put the X in there.
[18:21.890 --> 18:25.570]  And when you go to backcross it, you just use the X because it stands for cross and
[18:25.570 --> 18:26.650]  it's backcross.
[18:26.650 --> 18:29.650]  It makes sense, but I honestly don't think it is correct.
[18:29.650 --> 18:34.650]  The cannabis industry has kind of bastardized and just created and altered this labeling
[18:34.650 --> 18:37.570]  system to work for us.
[18:37.570 --> 18:41.050]  One thing I can say though, when we're listing genetics, this may be kind of a side ramp,
[18:41.050 --> 18:42.490]  but this is important.
[18:42.490 --> 18:48.450]  Always list ladies first or pollen donor first because sometimes we're working with feminized
[18:48.450 --> 18:49.450]  reverse plants.
[18:49.450 --> 18:50.870]  I don't want to call that one a boy.
[18:50.870 --> 18:52.210]  That is a reversed lady.
[18:52.210 --> 18:55.490]  In 2021, we've got to use the proper pronouns.
[18:55.490 --> 18:58.730]  That is a reversal, not a dude, not a lady.
[18:59.730 --> 19:02.490]  Definitely not a hermaphrodite, not intersex.
[19:02.490 --> 19:03.490]  It's definitely not a hermie.
[19:03.490 --> 19:05.850]  Hermie is not even a word.
[19:05.850 --> 19:08.050]  That word sounds so third grade to me.
[19:08.050 --> 19:09.050]  Hermie.
[19:09.050 --> 19:10.730]  Just say herm or intersex.
[19:10.730 --> 19:11.730]  Intersex is the real word.
[19:11.730 --> 19:15.850]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[19:15.850 --> 19:19.090]  clone cutters, polychuckers, my voice is cutting out really quickly here.
[19:19.090 --> 19:22.010]  I just felt it tell me, hey bro, it's time to wrap up this show.
[19:22.010 --> 19:24.650]  I'm going to listen to my body and quit rambling.
[19:24.650 --> 19:28.090]  I want to thank you guys and gals for listening to another episode of the Grow From Your Heart
[19:28.450 --> 19:29.450]  podcast.
