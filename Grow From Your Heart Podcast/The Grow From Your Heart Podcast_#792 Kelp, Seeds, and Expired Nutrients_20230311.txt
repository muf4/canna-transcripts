[00:01.150 --> 00:22.280]  All right, now here we go.
[00:22.280 --> 00:24.000]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.760]  I'm your host, Rasta Jeff.
[00:25.760 --> 00:30.440]  This is episode 792 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:30.440 --> 00:32.600]  I've got a fun episode lined up for us.
[00:32.600 --> 00:35.800]  In this episode, I am going to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:35.800 --> 00:40.320]  I've teamed up with our friends at seedsherenow.com to give away a free pack of seeds.
[00:40.320 --> 00:42.880]  Hang out, we'll talk more about that later in the show.
[00:42.880 --> 00:47.260]  I also want to remind you that I Regenetics will be at the Dude Grows Cup this year.
[00:47.260 --> 00:51.520]  That's right, the Dude Grows Cup is happening again June 3rd, just outside of Fort Collins,
[00:51.520 --> 00:52.520]  Colorado.
[00:52.520 --> 00:55.320]  Make sure you check out dgccup.com for all of the information.
[00:55.320 --> 00:58.640]  All right, I don't want to ramble too much at the start of the show.
[00:58.640 --> 01:01.320]  I do have a fun opening subject to jump into.
[01:01.320 --> 01:04.200]  I do want to talk about expired nutrients.
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.600]  That's right, I'm working with a friend online who's been asking me a bunch of questions.
[01:07.600 --> 01:11.120]  We've been trying to figure out why their grow just doesn't look right.
[01:11.120 --> 01:15.080]  We've checked on the water, we've checked on the soil, we've checked on the nutrients,
[01:15.080 --> 01:18.800]  we checked on the lights, we checked on the feeding, we checked on the scheduling, we
[01:18.800 --> 01:21.920]  checked on the runoff, we checked everything we could think of.
[01:21.920 --> 01:25.520]  Today, it was discovered that we were feeding those plants expired nutrients.
[01:25.520 --> 01:27.040]  I'm not at that grow personally.
[01:27.040 --> 01:31.520]  I'm doing everything through email and through FaceTime, but they opened up a bottle today
[01:31.520 --> 01:35.140]  and it smelled terrible and they realized these nutrients are expired.
[01:35.140 --> 01:36.900]  They've been in the grow for a long time.
[01:36.900 --> 01:41.100]  They did not realize that bottle has met its time.
[01:41.100 --> 01:44.920]  My advice to you is go in the grow and make sure that none of your products are expired
[01:44.920 --> 01:46.340]  because we've been chasing a problem.
[01:46.340 --> 01:49.780]  I've been trying to help a friend in their grow for quite a while and they discovered
[01:49.780 --> 01:52.900]  that the whole problem was an expired bottle of nutrients.
[01:52.900 --> 01:53.900]  I wasn't there to smell it.
[01:53.900 --> 01:55.060]  I wasn't there to inspect it.
[01:55.060 --> 01:58.660]  I don't know what it looked or smelled like, but maybe we would have caught that earlier
[01:58.660 --> 02:02.300]  if we would have just cracked it open, given it a smell because today they said it smelled
[02:02.300 --> 02:03.800]  terrible and putrid.
[02:03.800 --> 02:09.340]  We think and assume that that has been the culprit of our plant problem in that facility.
[02:09.340 --> 02:12.580]  Once again, my advice to you, if you've had a big bottle sitting on the shelf, if you've
[02:12.580 --> 02:16.060]  got a bunch of bottles that are sitting around that you don't use very often, maybe give
[02:16.060 --> 02:17.060]  them a shake.
[02:17.060 --> 02:20.120]  See if they're, maybe they've gotten runny or maybe they've gotten chunky.
[02:20.120 --> 02:21.660]  See if those products are still good.
[02:21.660 --> 02:23.360]  Maybe they smell real bad.
[02:23.360 --> 02:25.460]  Maybe they're supposed to smell bad and now they smell good.
[02:25.460 --> 02:28.940]  It's hard to tell with some grow nutrients, but there should be an expiration date printed
[02:28.940 --> 02:30.140]  on those bottles.
[02:30.140 --> 02:33.940]  My advice to you is go check and see if your products are out of date.
[02:33.940 --> 02:37.900]  Also check your pesticides and while you're at it, check all of your other gear as well.
[02:37.900 --> 02:39.100]  Let's do an inventory.
[02:39.140 --> 02:40.940]  Let's just do a regroup while we're at it.
[02:40.940 --> 02:44.100]  Go check everything while you're checking the pesticides and the nutrients.
[02:44.100 --> 02:45.100]  Do an inventory.
[02:45.100 --> 02:49.260]  Let's do a restock, order all of that shit, add gloves to the list while you're doing it.
[02:49.260 --> 02:50.260]  All right.
[02:50.260 --> 02:53.100]  So the main piece of advice I want you to take away from there is make sure the nutrients
[02:53.100 --> 02:54.100]  aren't expired.
[02:54.100 --> 02:57.960]  We've been feeding a grow for the past few weeks with an expired bottle and the plants
[02:57.960 --> 02:58.960]  look like shit.
[02:58.960 --> 02:59.960]  They don't look like shit.
[02:59.960 --> 03:00.960]  They just don't look turbo.
[03:00.960 --> 03:02.140]  They should be turbo by now.
[03:02.140 --> 03:04.120]  They look kind of normal and we wanted turbo.
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.480]  So it's that expired bottle that's making them slow down and not perky.
[03:07.480 --> 03:08.480]  Go check on your stuff.
[03:08.860 --> 03:09.860]  All right.
[03:09.860 --> 03:12.080]  I do want to segue into the email portion of today's podcast.
[03:12.080 --> 03:13.760]  I've got a lot of great questions.
[03:13.760 --> 03:17.960]  These questions do come from the grow help tab on the iRegenetics website.
[03:17.960 --> 03:22.080]  If you go to my website, iRegenetics.com, there's a row of tabs at the top.
[03:22.080 --> 03:26.360]  Toward the right, on the right top part of the page, there's a tab that says grow help
[03:26.360 --> 03:27.680]  or grow questions.
[03:27.680 --> 03:31.520]  If you click on there, it will bring you to a, it's like a little questionnaire.
[03:31.520 --> 03:33.640]  It asks you a bunch of questions about your grow.
[03:33.640 --> 03:35.240]  Basically, where are you growing?
[03:35.240 --> 03:36.240]  What are you growing?
[03:36.240 --> 03:37.240]  Are you indoors or outdoors?
[03:37.240 --> 03:38.240]  What are your temps?
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.960]  All of the things I need to know to help me diagnose your problem.
[03:41.960 --> 03:44.000]  It really helps out if I've got more info.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.320]  So fill that out the best you can.
[03:45.320 --> 03:49.080]  At the bottom, it says type in your grow question or tell us about your problem.
[03:49.080 --> 03:50.240]  Fill that in the best you can.
[03:50.240 --> 03:51.240]  Give me details.
[03:51.240 --> 03:54.000]  Then it also gives you the opportunity to attach photos.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.280]  If you've got good photos that may help, send those right along.
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.480]  And if I do read your grow question here on the podcast, I will send you a free pack of
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.680]  seeds and that free pack of seeds is sponsored by our friends at seedsherenow.com.
[04:06.680 --> 04:08.160]  Big shout out to seedsherenow.com.
[04:08.160 --> 04:15.120]  If you need regular feminized auto flower seeds, I definitely recommend seedsherenow.com.
[04:15.120 --> 04:16.120]  I am rambling.
[04:16.120 --> 04:17.400]  I was trying to avoid that.
[04:17.400 --> 04:19.320]  Once again, this message came from the grow help tab.
[04:19.320 --> 04:20.760]  Go check the grow help tab.
[04:20.760 --> 04:21.760]  Send me your questions.
[04:21.760 --> 04:25.080]  This one says, it says, first of all, I love and appreciate you brother.
[04:25.080 --> 04:26.240]  Big love and respect back at you.
[04:26.240 --> 04:31.000]  My friend says in some of your strain videos, which we love, you say in early flower, you
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.440]  use kelp to enhance the turps.
[04:33.440 --> 04:35.960]  Can you please elaborate on how you use the kelp?
[04:35.960 --> 04:39.920]  I have age old kelp and I have fed it lightly once in veg and once in flower.
[04:39.920 --> 04:42.040]  I'm currently in week two of flower.
[04:42.040 --> 04:43.560]  I've got shredder and orange chasm.
[04:43.560 --> 04:44.560]  They seem to love it.
[04:44.560 --> 04:46.440]  I just don't want to overdo it.
[04:46.440 --> 04:47.820]  Stay sexy, my friend.
[04:47.820 --> 04:51.520]  This one came from our friend who wants to be known as Billy D. Big shout out to our
[04:51.520 --> 04:54.360]  buddy Billy D. That is a really good question.
[04:54.360 --> 04:58.320]  Oh, and I'm going to mention, they referred to what I call, what they call the strain
[04:58.320 --> 04:59.320]  videos.
[04:59.320 --> 05:00.320]  Yes.
[05:00.320 --> 05:03.880]  If you scroll through my channel, you will see that there are many strain episodes, strain
[05:03.880 --> 05:04.880]  videos.
[05:04.880 --> 05:06.640]  I, of course, am iRegenetics premium seeds.
[05:06.640 --> 05:11.120]  I make seeds for iRegenetics and I do put out episodes that highlight those strains.
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.080]  We'll teach you how to grow them, give you advice about those strains and set you up
[05:15.080 --> 05:17.760]  for success with the seeds, which we do make.
[05:17.760 --> 05:20.880]  But in those episodes, I do mention a lot of kelp products.
[05:20.880 --> 05:24.960]  I don't mention any specific products, but I do mention kelp products quite frequently.
[05:24.960 --> 05:27.200]  I say that it's a good idea to use kelp.
[05:27.200 --> 05:34.640]  I feel like in, in my opinion, in my experience, in strains that are skunky, funky, earthy,
[05:34.680 --> 05:40.880]  cushy, those strains, that, that smell, that aroma, that flavor, that funk can be enhanced
[05:40.880 --> 05:44.000]  and really brought out with the addition of kelp products.
[05:44.000 --> 05:49.360]  I just feel like it makes it, if it's musty and funky, kelp will make it mustier and funkier.
[05:49.360 --> 05:52.240]  If those are even real words, is mustier a real word?
[05:52.240 --> 05:56.160]  It'll be more musty in my experience if you use that kelp.
[05:56.160 --> 05:59.280]  Aroma and flavor are not the only benefits of using a kelp product.
[05:59.280 --> 06:04.400]  I also feel like the proper use of kelp will increase in bud density and it always does
[06:04.400 --> 06:06.160]  help with root development.
[06:06.160 --> 06:10.720]  Think of that natural sea life, kelp grows, kelp is one of the largest growing organic
[06:10.720 --> 06:12.560]  bodies on earth, if I read that correctly.
[06:12.560 --> 06:15.840]  I didn't recite that the way that I read it, but kelp grows large, you guys.
[06:15.840 --> 06:18.720]  And imagine feeding that bio-life to your ganja plants.
[06:18.720 --> 06:19.840]  They are going to grow live.
[06:19.840 --> 06:20.640]  They're going to grow large.
[06:20.640 --> 06:21.680]  They're going to love it.
[06:21.680 --> 06:23.040]  So kelp is always good.
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.400]  It enhances root growth.
[06:24.400 --> 06:28.560]  It enhances flavor, aroma, and I also think it helps with bud density.
[06:28.560 --> 06:31.920]  So that is why I talk about kelp in a lot of those episodes.
[06:31.920 --> 06:36.960]  Anything that's skunky, funky, gassy, cushy in that realm, give it more kelp.
[06:36.960 --> 06:40.720]  The fruity things will like the kelp as well and it will make the flavor stronger, but
[06:40.720 --> 06:45.920]  I really think it enhances that funkiness of a naturally funky smelling plant.
[06:45.920 --> 06:47.600]  So let's talk a little bit about it.
[06:48.400 --> 06:50.320]  Elaborate on how I use kelp.
[06:50.880 --> 06:53.440]  There are several ways to make kelp available to your plants.
[06:53.440 --> 06:55.360]  There are liquid kelp products.
[06:55.360 --> 06:56.720]  There are dried kelp products.
[06:56.720 --> 06:58.400]  There's a kelp meal product.
[06:58.400 --> 07:00.160]  It's all about your approach to growing.
[07:00.160 --> 07:01.600]  It kind of depends on how you want to do it.
[07:01.600 --> 07:04.400]  You've got age old kelp, which is a beautiful product.
[07:04.400 --> 07:06.080]  Age old is a really, it's an old brand.
[07:06.080 --> 07:07.520]  They've been around for a long time.
[07:07.520 --> 07:10.640]  They make a quality product and they've got a kelp specific product.
[07:10.640 --> 07:12.800]  So you're right in the right wheelhouse there.
[07:12.800 --> 07:14.480]  That is a liquid kelp product.
[07:15.040 --> 07:18.880]  Another liquid kelp product I would recommend that I really enjoy is Liquid Karma.
[07:18.880 --> 07:23.600]  However, that brand was bought by somebody, the Botanicare brand was bought by somebody,
[07:23.600 --> 07:25.600]  which we try not to buy their products.
[07:25.600 --> 07:30.240]  So no matter how great that product is, I'm still torn sometimes when I do choose to buy it.
[07:30.240 --> 07:31.600]  That's called Liquid Karma.
[07:31.600 --> 07:35.920]  There's a brand out there called Raw that makes a powdered kelp product, raw nutrients.
[07:35.920 --> 07:36.800]  They're powdered.
[07:36.800 --> 07:39.040]  It's R-A-W, raw is the name of the brand.
[07:39.600 --> 07:42.240]  They make a great powdered kelp product.
[07:42.240 --> 07:48.480]  And the folks that make Fox Farms product make a kelp product that is called Kelp Me, Kelp You.
[07:49.120 --> 07:51.360]  All of those products will be easy to use.
[07:51.360 --> 07:52.560]  They're all cost-effective.
[07:52.560 --> 07:53.680]  They're all quite affordable.
[07:54.240 --> 07:59.680]  The Liquid Karma and some of your liquid kelp products can actually be used as a foliar feed.
[07:59.680 --> 08:02.720]  I would imagine you could use the raw powdered kelp as a foliar
[08:02.720 --> 08:06.000]  if you shake it up and dissolve it really well before you apply it.
[08:06.000 --> 08:08.320]  Don't quote me on that because I have not used that product,
[08:08.320 --> 08:12.080]  but most kelp products you can foliar feed as long as they don't gum up your system,
[08:12.080 --> 08:15.920]  as long as they aren't too thick when you apply it so that it doesn't clog up your plants.
[08:16.640 --> 08:19.360]  So how to use it, how to use the kelp.
[08:19.360 --> 08:24.560]  It says so far that you have used the kelp once in veg and one time week two in flour.
[08:24.560 --> 08:25.760]  So that's a good start.
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.480]  Depending on the products you choose to use and how you are growing,
[08:29.040 --> 08:31.280]  that will kind of dictate how you use the kelp.
[08:31.280 --> 08:34.400]  Let's talk about a couple of ways that I would recommend using it.
[08:34.400 --> 08:35.840]  I like to grow in cocoa.
[08:35.840 --> 08:39.440]  So in cocoa, I would probably add a kelp product once a week
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.480]  throughout most of the entire cycle of that plant.
[08:42.480 --> 08:44.880]  Once it goes into its big veg pot,
[08:44.880 --> 08:47.920]  then I'm going to start adding some sort of a kelp product weekly
[08:48.480 --> 08:52.880]  all the way up to probably about week six or maybe even week seven of flour,
[08:52.880 --> 08:55.600]  depending on how long that plant is going to go.
[08:55.600 --> 08:58.880]  So from week early in veg all the way through veg,
[08:58.880 --> 09:03.040]  all the way through flour up until right about almost pre-flush time,
[09:03.040 --> 09:05.200]  basically I am feeding a kelp product.
[09:05.200 --> 09:07.920]  Now the trick to that is I slowly increase that product.
[09:08.800 --> 09:12.560]  I can't tell you how many milliliters or how many grams or how much to use
[09:12.560 --> 09:15.120]  because I'm not sure which product you're going to use.
[09:15.120 --> 09:18.320]  But my advice is start low and then just work your way up a little bit.
[09:18.320 --> 09:20.160]  Don't go drastic, don't go crazy,
[09:20.160 --> 09:24.880]  but do increase a little bit toward by the time you get done with the flowering stage
[09:24.880 --> 09:27.120]  that you are probably at the full recommended dose,
[09:27.120 --> 09:28.880]  which is written on that bottle.
[09:28.880 --> 09:34.080]  Most of the time I'll recommend feeding 50% of the recommended dosage of a product
[09:34.080 --> 09:36.640]  because the plants usually don't need what they recommend.
[09:36.640 --> 09:38.480]  The nutrient company wants you to buy more.
[09:38.480 --> 09:40.560]  So they tell you to feed a little bit extra,
[09:40.560 --> 09:42.720]  start off with about 50%, work your way up.
[09:43.280 --> 09:45.280]  By the time you're done with the kelp product,
[09:45.280 --> 09:48.240]  that's when I think you should probably be at that 100% mark.
[09:48.240 --> 09:51.280]  So about week six and just slowly work your way up to there.
[09:51.280 --> 09:52.960]  It's not going to be huge, huge steps,
[09:52.960 --> 09:55.280]  just gradual increases over every couple of weeks.
[09:55.280 --> 09:57.760]  So with the liquid product in cocoa,
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.520]  I would do cocoa once a week and I would slowly step up,
[10:01.520 --> 10:04.640]  start low and then work your way up to the recommended dosage by the end.
[10:05.360 --> 10:06.880]  Then what else, how else are we going to grow?
[10:06.880 --> 10:08.880]  We're going to grow in a soilless mix.
[10:08.880 --> 10:12.480]  With a soilless mix, I would probably do it once again, once per week,
[10:12.480 --> 10:15.120]  but I may go a little bit heavier with the dosage this time.
[10:15.120 --> 10:17.040]  I may not go as light as I do in cocoa.
[10:17.040 --> 10:17.760]  Now what's left?
[10:17.760 --> 10:18.720]  I wrote down hydro.
[10:18.720 --> 10:20.960]  Hydro is our last option to work with.
[10:20.960 --> 10:23.680]  I would do hydro very similarly to the other two,
[10:23.680 --> 10:25.920]  but in a hydro reservoir, you can only feed,
[10:25.920 --> 10:27.280]  basically we're feeding once a week.
[10:27.280 --> 10:29.760]  You mix it up and let it run for the week in a hydro res.
[10:30.320 --> 10:32.000]  So I would do it basically every week
[10:32.000 --> 10:35.760]  from the time the plants get big and established and get sturdy and healthy.
[10:35.760 --> 10:38.320]  Start adding that kelp product and just like I said before,
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.000]  start low and then work your way up in those hydro buckets.
[10:42.000 --> 10:44.000]  And in cocoa, you're definitely going to notice
[10:44.560 --> 10:48.320]  the kelp product more quickly than you are in the soilless mix.
[10:48.320 --> 10:51.200]  Now, if you want to add this to some sort of a living soil
[10:51.200 --> 10:52.800]  or one of those no-till beds,
[10:53.360 --> 10:56.800]  disclaimer, this is not my area of expertise when it comes to no-till,
[10:57.360 --> 10:58.400]  organics, things like that.
[10:58.400 --> 11:00.320]  That is not my area of expertise,
[11:00.320 --> 11:04.480]  but that is when you're going to want to stir in that kelp product early in.
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.040]  Stir that in before you mix it into the soil,
[11:07.040 --> 11:08.960]  before you even start putting the plants in.
[11:08.960 --> 11:12.880]  Then you might want to top dress or top feed it later on with the kelp product.
[11:12.880 --> 11:14.880]  You could put the kelp in with water,
[11:14.880 --> 11:16.640]  feed it that way, or you can top dress it,
[11:16.640 --> 11:18.400]  let it break down into the soil that way.
[11:19.040 --> 11:21.120]  Once again, I am not the organics expert,
[11:21.120 --> 11:24.880]  but those are two, three very viable options to get plants,
[11:24.880 --> 11:27.840]  the kelp product if you are using organics.
[11:27.840 --> 11:31.520]  So quick recap there, hydro, basically hydro,
[11:31.520 --> 11:33.760]  soilless mix, cocoa, almost everything.
[11:33.760 --> 11:36.560]  I would feed it once per week and I would start low
[11:36.560 --> 11:39.440]  and I would gradually taper up until you're going about 100%,
[11:39.440 --> 11:41.920]  maybe a little bit more if you really want to push it,
[11:41.920 --> 11:44.640]  120% of what the recommended dosage is.
[11:44.640 --> 11:47.600]  At the end, start low and work your way up, you guys.
[11:47.600 --> 11:48.240]  That's what I'm saying.
[11:48.240 --> 11:50.320]  Don't go burning the plants and pay attention.
[11:50.320 --> 11:53.200]  Just because I'm saying that you can get to 100, maybe 120,
[11:53.200 --> 11:55.280]  doesn't mean that your plant is going to take that.
[11:55.280 --> 11:57.280]  All of these plants are a little bit different.
[11:57.280 --> 11:59.520]  So pay really close attention to your plant.
[11:59.520 --> 12:00.720]  Are the leaves curling?
[12:00.720 --> 12:01.680]  Is the growth stunted?
[12:01.680 --> 12:02.880]  Is something going weird?
[12:02.880 --> 12:03.680]  That could be a sign.
[12:03.680 --> 12:06.960]  So back off if you see too much reaction from that.
[12:06.960 --> 12:08.720]  All right, I think I answered this question.
[12:08.720 --> 12:10.720]  Elaborate on how I use the kelp.
[12:10.720 --> 12:13.600]  Feed it just like any other nutrient and feed it about once a week
[12:13.600 --> 12:15.920]  and then start early and work your way on up
[12:15.920 --> 12:17.840]  until you're going kind of hard with the kelp.
[12:17.840 --> 12:20.000]  I think the gassier and funkier,
[12:21.600 --> 12:24.320]  cushier sort of varietals, the chem dogs and things,
[12:24.320 --> 12:26.800]  they really love this sort of treatment.
[12:26.800 --> 12:29.280]  They really love the kelp products.
[12:29.280 --> 12:32.240]  Also, the cushions and chems, if you're going to do some kelp,
[12:32.240 --> 12:34.240]  add some CalMag to that mix as well
[12:34.240 --> 12:36.400]  and they will really love each other together.
[12:36.400 --> 12:38.560]  All right, my friend, Billy D, thank you for the great message.
[12:38.560 --> 12:39.760]  I do appreciate that.
[12:39.760 --> 12:41.920]  Since I read your question here on the podcast,
[12:41.920 --> 12:44.560]  that means that you win a free pack of seeds.
[12:44.560 --> 12:47.360]  That's right, you win a free pack of Iry Genetic Seeds.
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.520]  Again, that free seed giveaway is sponsored by my friends at seedsherenow.com.
[12:51.520 --> 12:55.760]  Shout out to seedsherenow.com for giving you a free pack of seeds.
[12:55.760 --> 12:58.080]  All right, let's jump into one more message here.
[12:58.080 --> 13:01.200]  This one came also from the Grow Help tab from,
[13:01.200 --> 13:03.040]  does it say what they want their name to be?
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.400]  It does not have their name on it.
[13:04.400 --> 13:05.120]  It goes like this.
[13:05.120 --> 13:08.320]  It says, yo, Rasta Jeff, you inspired me to start breeding
[13:08.320 --> 13:09.600]  and I'm not going to lie to you.
[13:09.600 --> 13:12.000]  I'm going to start my line with your line
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.600]  and I chose Saka Souffle to start my breeding project.
[13:16.160 --> 13:17.680]  That is a huge compliment.
[13:17.680 --> 13:20.400]  Many breeders out there get pissy and get territorial
[13:20.400 --> 13:22.240]  when people talk about breeding with their products,
[13:22.240 --> 13:22.960]  but guess what?
[13:22.960 --> 13:23.760]  Not me.
[13:23.760 --> 13:24.480]  I agree.
[13:24.480 --> 13:25.120]  I promote it.
[13:25.120 --> 13:25.760]  I endorse it.
[13:25.760 --> 13:26.640]  I condone it.
[13:26.640 --> 13:29.600]  I really encourage people to breed with my products.
[13:29.600 --> 13:32.240]  First of all, if you want to breed with my products,
[13:32.240 --> 13:33.600]  that's a compliment to me.
[13:33.600 --> 13:36.000]  Why would I be mad that you want to use my creations
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.600]  to start your new creations?
[13:37.600 --> 13:39.200]  That's a huge compliment to me.
[13:39.200 --> 13:40.160]  Thank you.
[13:40.160 --> 13:42.560]  Also, why would I be mad at a person for trying to breed
[13:42.560 --> 13:45.840]  their own cannabis and make themselves self-sustainable
[13:45.840 --> 13:47.600]  and enjoy cannabis a little bit more?
[13:47.600 --> 13:50.400]  Enjoy the plant, the craft, the art, develop some skills.
[13:50.400 --> 13:52.160]  Why would I be mad at anybody about that?
[13:52.880 --> 13:55.680]  And then the bottom line is here, you bought those seeds,
[13:55.680 --> 13:56.720]  bro, those are yours.
[13:56.720 --> 13:58.800]  You paid money for them or you traded for them.
[13:58.800 --> 14:00.560]  Hopefully you did it honestly.
[14:00.560 --> 14:03.200]  If you got those seeds honestly, then you can grow them,
[14:03.200 --> 14:04.720]  breed them, trade them, sell them.
[14:04.720 --> 14:05.920]  You can do whatever you want with them.
[14:05.920 --> 14:07.280]  I can't say anything about it.
[14:07.280 --> 14:09.040]  I've got the money that I needed when you bought them
[14:09.040 --> 14:11.280]  and after that, bro, it's all yours.
[14:11.280 --> 14:12.000]  Have a good time.
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.560]  That's like you telling me that I can't skate my skateboard
[14:14.560 --> 14:15.840]  hard or drive my car fast.
[14:15.840 --> 14:16.800]  I paid for it.
[14:16.800 --> 14:18.320]  I'm going to do my thing, bro.
[14:18.320 --> 14:19.520]  You do that thing with your seeds,
[14:19.520 --> 14:20.800]  but I want to keep going.
[14:20.800 --> 14:22.400]  I appreciate that and encourage it.
[14:22.400 --> 14:23.600]  Breed with my stuff.
[14:23.600 --> 14:24.160]  It goes on.
[14:24.160 --> 14:25.360]  I chose Saka Soufflé.
[14:25.920 --> 14:27.440]  Biscotti is my favorite strain.
[14:27.440 --> 14:30.000]  You're going to find a great biscotti flavored male in there.
[14:30.000 --> 14:31.680]  It says, I have a couple of questions for you.
[14:31.680 --> 14:35.520]  When you make seeds, how long do you veg your plants?
[14:35.520 --> 14:37.600]  If you were in my position and chose Saka Soufflé
[14:37.600 --> 14:40.320]  to start your breeding project, how long would you veg it
[14:40.320 --> 14:43.360]  since you know that particular cultivar very well?
[14:43.920 --> 14:46.320]  There's a couple of things that get my attention in here.
[14:46.320 --> 14:49.440]  First of all, I would recommend if you're going to breed
[14:49.440 --> 14:52.560]  with this plant that you grow out several phenotypes
[14:52.560 --> 14:55.280]  of it multiple times and get a relationship with it.
[14:55.280 --> 14:56.400]  You're going to do a pheno hunt.
[14:56.400 --> 14:58.240]  I'm assuming you've got a 10, which probably came
[14:58.240 --> 14:59.920]  with 12 seeds in the pack.
[14:59.920 --> 15:01.200]  So you got 10 or 12 seeds.
[15:01.200 --> 15:03.680]  Maybe you shared that with a friend, but I'm going to say,
[15:03.680 --> 15:05.120]  grow as many seeds as you can.
[15:05.120 --> 15:07.440]  Identify the females, identify the males.
[15:07.600 --> 15:10.080]  Separate them and then flower them out
[15:10.080 --> 15:12.080]  and find what is the best for you.
[15:12.080 --> 15:15.200]  You're going to find a male that looks like he's the stud,
[15:15.200 --> 15:16.560]  the dude, the stud, the guy.
[15:17.360 --> 15:18.080]  Keep him aside.
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.920]  Now we've got to run the females a couple of times.
[15:19.920 --> 15:22.560]  We want to see, unless you want to pollinate multiple females,
[15:22.560 --> 15:24.160]  if you just want to do one and one,
[15:24.160 --> 15:26.160]  you really have to do some careful selection.
[15:26.160 --> 15:27.680]  You can't do that on just one run.
[15:27.680 --> 15:30.720]  I'd recommend running it two, maybe three times
[15:30.720 --> 15:32.640]  unless you plan on pollinating everything.
[15:32.640 --> 15:36.320]  So I would run it the first time, find the boys, find the girls.
[15:36.640 --> 15:37.840]  This is just an audition run.
[15:37.840 --> 15:38.880]  We're just kind of getting to know them.
[15:38.880 --> 15:41.840]  The second run, we're really going to isolate two or three girls
[15:41.840 --> 15:43.760]  that we really like and see which one is the best.
[15:43.760 --> 15:44.720]  Then we'll breed to that.
[15:44.720 --> 15:46.160]  Let's grow it a little bit.
[15:46.160 --> 15:48.160]  Find out if there's any problems with this plant.
[15:48.160 --> 15:50.960]  I doubt there will be, but it could have problems.
[15:50.960 --> 15:53.440]  It could be, I bred this plant and I'm still going to say it.
[15:53.440 --> 15:54.480]  It could be intersex.
[15:54.480 --> 15:55.680]  It could be a mutant.
[15:55.680 --> 15:59.200]  It could be a fucking freak show of a plant that doesn't do what you want done.
[15:59.200 --> 16:03.520]  So let's not get too attached to breeding with this plant right away
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.720]  because it may not fit the criteria which you're hoping for.
[16:06.720 --> 16:08.640]  Just because your favorite plant is biscotti
[16:08.640 --> 16:12.240]  and there's biscotti in here doesn't mean that this is going to be a breeding winner.
[16:12.240 --> 16:15.040]  And I would like to say it is because I made it, but still it may not be.
[16:15.040 --> 16:16.960]  That's the chances of reality.
[16:16.960 --> 16:18.720]  That's the chances of genetics.
[16:18.720 --> 16:20.160]  That's like, it's like dating.
[16:20.160 --> 16:21.600]  Maybe we're not going to get along.
[16:21.600 --> 16:25.440]  Maybe you're the plant and that, and you aren't going to get along well.
[16:25.440 --> 16:26.480]  That's the bottom line.
[16:26.480 --> 16:27.600]  So run them a couple of times.
[16:27.600 --> 16:30.400]  Let's see if it's really what you want before you do the breeding.
[16:30.400 --> 16:33.200]  Now let's talk on, touch on the actual breeding question.
[16:33.200 --> 16:35.040]  How big would I veg the plants?
[16:35.040 --> 16:36.240]  This is a really good question.
[16:37.120 --> 16:39.920]  Maybe I shouldn't tell you all this information, but come on in.
[16:39.920 --> 16:42.960]  It's time to reveal some, some breeding secrets.
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.680]  You don't really need a lot of space or really big plants to create a lot of seeds.
[16:47.680 --> 16:50.240]  Honestly, if you're going to breed with the biscotti
[16:50.240 --> 16:52.080]  and you just want to make seeds for yourself,
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.320]  you can make a hundred seeds from a plant grown in a beer cup.
[16:56.320 --> 16:57.120]  I am not joking.
[16:57.120 --> 16:58.800]  I'm not exaggerating at all.
[16:58.800 --> 17:00.480]  A beer cup is this tall.
[17:00.480 --> 17:03.200]  You can veg the plant to be this tall-ish.
[17:03.200 --> 17:04.640]  I don't know if you're watching on the video,
[17:04.640 --> 17:07.360]  but that's half, maybe three quarters the size of the beer cups.
[17:07.360 --> 17:10.960]  This tall veg, it's about half, three quarters the size of the beer cup,
[17:10.960 --> 17:13.120]  and then flip it and then pollinate.
[17:13.120 --> 17:16.160]  If you pollinate two or three of those plants that are the same size,
[17:16.160 --> 17:19.440]  all of the same clone, you're going to make a couple of hundred seeds,
[17:19.440 --> 17:22.320]  probably a hundred to 200 seeds really easily.
[17:22.320 --> 17:25.600]  If the plant's real little, you'll still pull 30 to 50 seeds off of it.
[17:25.600 --> 17:28.480]  You don't need a lot of biomass to pollinate the plants.
[17:28.480 --> 17:29.920]  They can be really little.
[17:29.920 --> 17:31.440]  If you just want to make some for yourself,
[17:31.440 --> 17:33.520]  my advice is to veg them in cups.
[17:33.520 --> 17:34.880]  Get them about, what is that?
[17:34.880 --> 17:37.200]  GI Joe is three and three quarters of an inch tall.
[17:37.200 --> 17:40.400]  Veg them GI Joe tall and then flower them,
[17:40.400 --> 17:41.920]  the male and the female at the same time.
[17:41.920 --> 17:43.680]  Put them in there, let them go.
[17:43.680 --> 17:46.320]  That's going to be a good first practice breeding run.
[17:46.320 --> 17:47.600]  You'll see what the flowers,
[17:47.600 --> 17:50.160]  what the male plant does all the way through the flowering cycle.
[17:50.160 --> 17:51.280]  You'll see what the females do.
[17:51.280 --> 17:53.120]  You'll see what pollination looks like.
[17:53.120 --> 17:55.040]  You'll see what ripe and mature seeds look like.
[17:55.040 --> 17:56.480]  You'll see how long it takes,
[17:56.480 --> 17:58.960]  and you'll have a good batch of seeds to play with.
[17:59.040 --> 18:00.640]  If you really want to get critical with it,
[18:00.640 --> 18:02.560]  you can time the male and female differently.
[18:02.560 --> 18:04.320]  I don't know when the male is going to dump pollen.
[18:04.320 --> 18:07.040]  I don't know when the female will be ready for pollen exactly
[18:07.040 --> 18:08.560]  because I haven't ran these plants yet.
[18:08.560 --> 18:10.000]  But the way nature works,
[18:10.000 --> 18:12.320]  if you put them side by side and put them into flower,
[18:12.320 --> 18:14.000]  it will, the pollination will work.
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.800]  You may make more seeds if you do one earlier, one later,
[18:16.800 --> 18:19.840]  but let's worry about that on your second and third breeding runs.
[18:19.840 --> 18:23.040]  Let's just put the appropriate boy and appropriate girl in there
[18:23.040 --> 18:24.320]  and put them in at the same time,
[18:24.320 --> 18:26.640]  and you'll make plenty of seeds for yourself.
[18:26.640 --> 18:29.680]  So if you want to make just enough seeds for yourself to play with,
[18:29.680 --> 18:32.720]  beer cups, one gallon pots, small plants.
[18:32.720 --> 18:36.880]  You just need one top cola the size of He-Man.
[18:36.880 --> 18:40.960]  I know I'm using fucking toys from the 90s and 80s as size reference today,
[18:40.960 --> 18:45.200]  but Vegitelt's GI Joe and a He-Man size plant
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.000]  will give you 30 to 50 seeds if you do it properly.
[18:48.000 --> 18:51.040]  Sometimes you'll get 90 to 100 seeds out of a little tiny plant.
[18:51.040 --> 18:54.160]  It just depends on how much biomass is on that plant to receive,
[18:54.160 --> 18:56.480]  how many pistils are there to receive pollen.
[18:56.480 --> 18:58.560]  To create seeds out of those plants.
[18:58.560 --> 19:00.480]  If you want to make more seeds, grow bigger plants,
[19:00.480 --> 19:03.760]  but honestly, the beer cup method is really simple to do
[19:03.760 --> 19:05.280]  and it does not take a lot of space.
[19:05.840 --> 19:07.920]  Just make sure that those seeds get time to finish.
[19:07.920 --> 19:09.760]  That's going to be one of the most important things.
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.480]  Select your female or females, select your male, get a clone,
[19:14.480 --> 19:17.760]  have backups, have backup plants of these in case something goes wrong
[19:17.760 --> 19:20.320]  and so that we can replicate this procedure in the future.
[19:20.320 --> 19:23.600]  You got your backups, get clones, put the clones into the beer cups.
[19:24.240 --> 19:26.640]  Get those beer cups growing about the size of GI Joe,
[19:26.640 --> 19:28.400]  three and three quarters of an inch tall.
[19:28.400 --> 19:31.600]  Put the male and female or females into your flowering chamber.
[19:31.600 --> 19:33.840]  I'm not even saying flowering room at this time
[19:33.840 --> 19:35.920]  because these plants are so little, they get a chamber.
[19:35.920 --> 19:37.360]  They don't need a whole room to themselves.
[19:37.360 --> 19:40.080]  They just need, you could do this in a very small,
[19:40.080 --> 19:41.920]  a two by two by four foot space.
[19:41.920 --> 19:44.720]  You could definitely bang out plenty of seeds with the right light,
[19:44.720 --> 19:46.480]  with the right cooling, with the right ventilation,
[19:46.480 --> 19:48.560]  with paying the right attention and timing things.
[19:48.560 --> 19:51.760]  So put them in that room, let them pollinate, they'll get it on
[19:51.760 --> 19:54.480]  and then six, seven, eight or nine weeks from there,
[19:54.480 --> 19:56.560]  you will have a small batch of seeds.
[19:56.560 --> 19:59.200]  Then here's the fun part, you get to grow all of those seeds.
[19:59.200 --> 20:01.920]  Don't share them, don't give them away until you've ran a few
[20:01.920 --> 20:03.920]  and verified that they're not problematic,
[20:03.920 --> 20:06.080]  until you're confident in those seeds.
[20:06.080 --> 20:08.160]  So let me check on the message and make sure that I actually
[20:08.160 --> 20:09.760]  answered some of your question here.
[20:10.560 --> 20:13.280]  When you make seeds, how long do you let your plants veg?
[20:13.920 --> 20:16.240]  If I was in your position, so yeah, I would do it in beer cups.
[20:16.240 --> 20:17.840]  Honestly, you're just trying to make a few seeds.
[20:17.840 --> 20:20.240]  We don't know if these seeds are going to be amazing.
[20:20.240 --> 20:21.760]  We don't know if they're going to be intersex.
[20:21.760 --> 20:23.520]  We don't know if they're going to be duds.
[20:23.520 --> 20:24.640]  We don't know what you're creating.
[20:24.640 --> 20:26.240]  So let's not make too many of them.
[20:26.240 --> 20:28.000]  It's easy to throw away 90 seeds.
[20:28.640 --> 20:32.000]  It really hurts your feelings to throw away 9,000 seeds.
[20:32.000 --> 20:33.280]  Trust me, I've had to do it before.
[20:33.280 --> 20:35.920]  It's the only thing you can do, put them in the compost bin
[20:35.920 --> 20:37.840]  because if I put those seeds out to you guys,
[20:37.840 --> 20:39.040]  you're going to be angry at me.
[20:39.040 --> 20:39.920]  You're not going to be happy.
[20:39.920 --> 20:41.760]  It's going to tarnish the reputation,
[20:41.760 --> 20:44.000]  the level of quality that you expect from me.
[20:44.000 --> 20:46.960]  So make little plants, make a few,
[20:46.960 --> 20:49.040]  and maybe to you, a hundred is a bunch of seeds.
[20:49.040 --> 20:51.360]  Make a few seeds to play with, grow them.
[20:51.360 --> 20:53.440]  Then we can always go back and make more.
[20:53.440 --> 20:54.160]  And if you did it right,
[20:54.160 --> 20:56.160]  you probably found the keeper that you want
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.400]  in that 30 to 50 seeds anyway.
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.920]  There will be something hot in there
[20:59.920 --> 21:01.440]  if you've done this properly.
[21:01.440 --> 21:03.920]  I'm really curious if you're going to use my Saka Souffle
[21:03.920 --> 21:07.200]  as a male plant, which females are you going to pollinate?
[21:07.200 --> 21:08.720]  Are there, is there more advice on that?
[21:08.720 --> 21:10.240]  Yeah, you're going to use the Saka Souffle.
[21:11.280 --> 21:12.240]  What are you going to pollinate?
[21:12.240 --> 21:14.240]  What is the other plant in the mix here?
[21:16.320 --> 21:17.920]  Nope, no advice on that one.
[21:17.920 --> 21:19.280]  But I'm excited.
[21:19.280 --> 21:21.440]  I, and once again, I do encourage everybody out there
[21:21.440 --> 21:22.320]  to breed with my seeds.
[21:22.320 --> 21:24.480]  If you want to be a seed breeder, a seed maker,
[21:24.480 --> 21:26.000]  my seeds are a great way to start that.
[21:26.000 --> 21:28.000]  Now, once you do make those little,
[21:28.000 --> 21:29.120]  little cups worth of seeds,
[21:29.120 --> 21:31.040]  if you really like something and you want to make more,
[21:31.040 --> 21:33.520]  obviously the next step is to grow those plants bigger
[21:33.520 --> 21:35.280]  next time and make bigger plants.
[21:35.280 --> 21:37.760]  In a three gallon pot, you can make a lot of plants.
[21:37.760 --> 21:40.800]  If you let that plant veg up to 12 or 18 inches tall,
[21:40.800 --> 21:42.240]  time that pollination right,
[21:42.240 --> 21:44.720]  you'll have enough seeds to last you the rest of your life.
[21:44.720 --> 21:46.080]  Just from one plant.
[21:46.080 --> 21:48.640]  If you just want to run those seeds by yourself.
[21:48.640 --> 21:50.880]  All right, that question did come from a person
[21:50.880 --> 21:52.640]  who did not indicate if they did
[21:52.640 --> 21:54.320]  or did not want their name to be said.
[21:54.320 --> 21:56.720]  But if you're watching this podcast episode,

[23:13.200 --> 23:14.640]  So keep those good questions coming.
[23:14.640 --> 23:15.760]  If I haven't read your question,

[23:17.440 --> 23:18.400]  Don't feel judged.
[23:18.400 --> 23:19.600]  Don't feel like I'm hating on you.
[23:19.600 --> 23:21.360]  I've got this many questions.
[23:21.360 --> 23:22.480]  That's a lot of paper right there.
[23:22.480 --> 23:23.760]  I got that many questions waiting,
[23:23.760 --> 23:24.880]  coming up on the show.
[23:24.880 --> 23:26.240]  I'm going to work through most of them.
[23:26.240 --> 23:28.160]  I'm going to do my best to get to all of them.
[23:28.160 --> 23:29.520]  It just takes time, you guys.
[23:29.520 --> 23:31.120]  So keep sending those grow questions
[23:31.120 --> 23:34.480]  to the Grow Help tab on iRegenetics.com.
