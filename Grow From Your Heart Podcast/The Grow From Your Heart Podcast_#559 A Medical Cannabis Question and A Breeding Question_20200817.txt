[00:56.520 --> 01:02.440]  You know, I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[01:02.440 --> 01:07.760]  Today, I've been taking dabs of honey banana full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[01:07.800 --> 01:10.680]  This is a blend of banana OG and honey boo boo.
[01:10.680 --> 01:14.400]  On the package, the flavor is described as frosted banana pastry.
[01:14.400 --> 01:16.200]  We've talked about this concentrate on the show before.
[01:16.200 --> 01:20.880]  I had to go back and buy a bunch more because I really enjoy the flavor, the aroma and the
[01:20.880 --> 01:23.000]  buzz is fucking perfect.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.320]  From the honey banana full spectrum extract, I'll show you the jar.
[01:26.320 --> 01:30.720]  There's only a little bit left in that jar because I have been going in, but it's a beautiful
[01:30.720 --> 01:35.480]  color, beautiful texture, a beautiful ratio of terp sauce to crystals.
[01:35.480 --> 01:40.040]  I definitely enjoy the honey banana full spectrum extract from Green Dot Labs.
[01:40.040 --> 01:42.840]  All right, in this episode, I'm going to cover a couple of emails.
[01:42.840 --> 01:45.200]  We're going to answer some listener questions.
[01:45.200 --> 01:48.920]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few members of the 710 club.
[01:48.920 --> 01:53.920]  Of course, the 710 club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month

[02:25.740 --> 02:26.740]  Big shout out to Ty.

[02:29.440 --> 02:30.440]  You're killing it in life.
[02:30.440 --> 02:33.120]  Also, let's send a big thank you shout out to my friend, Keith Kent.

[02:41.100 --> 02:44.780]  Let's not forget our good friend and faithful follower, longtime supporter.
[02:44.780 --> 02:47.800]  Let's give a big thank you shout out to my buddy, Stabby McStabwood.
[02:47.800 --> 02:48.800]  What's up, bro?
[02:48.800 --> 02:49.800]  I haven't talked to you in a minute.
[02:49.800 --> 02:51.120]  I hope you are doing very well.
[02:51.120 --> 02:55.200]  Also, let's wrap it up with a big Grow From Your Heart thank you podcast shout out and
[02:55.200 --> 02:57.560]  a thank you to my friend, Aaron.

[03:21.440 --> 03:23.200]  Thank you guys for the continued support.
[03:23.200 --> 03:24.440]  It does mean the world to me.
[03:24.440 --> 03:26.760]  It is making life easier and better.
[03:26.760 --> 03:29.720]  And when I get some things organized, I'm going to do more podcasts.
[03:30.120 --> 03:33.760]  I've got a couple of obstacles in the way I'm working on removing those obstacles once
[03:33.760 --> 03:36.680]  they're gone more podcasting because you guys deserve it.
[03:36.680 --> 03:37.680]  Thank you.
[03:37.680 --> 03:38.680]  Thank you for the support.
[03:38.680 --> 03:39.680]  I want to give you more.
[03:39.680 --> 03:44.000]  Speaking about giving more let's talk about I owe you guys an update.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.660]  In a recent podcast, somebody asked me about a product called a My Herbs Now herb dryer.
[03:50.660 --> 03:53.520]  And I said that I wouldn't recommend a drying machine.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.520]  I was met with a lot of feedback.
[03:55.520 --> 04:00.040]  Apparently, a lot of my listeners are using the My Herbs Now machine and they fucking
[04:00.040 --> 04:05.760]  approve I did not get one bit of feedback that says that device is not a quality product.
[04:05.760 --> 04:08.080]  So I cannot endorse it myself.
[04:08.080 --> 04:11.600]  But I can tell you that many of my listeners chimed in and said, Hey, bro, that's a good
[04:11.600 --> 04:12.600]  product.
[04:12.600 --> 04:13.840]  So I want to give you an update.
[04:13.840 --> 04:19.400]  The My Herbs Now drying and curing machine seems to meet standards of many of my listeners.
[04:19.400 --> 04:23.600]  So if that is something you've been looking at, I think we've got the seal of approval.
[04:23.600 --> 04:27.520]  I may grab one myself put some buds through that and give it the personal Rasta Jeff test,
[04:27.520 --> 04:29.120]  then we will review it on the show.
[04:29.120 --> 04:31.440]  But so far, it sounds like people are satisfied.
[04:31.440 --> 04:33.480]  Alright, so I covered that update.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.480]  Let's keep moving.
[04:34.480 --> 04:37.960]  Where else are we the Jack the Ripper updates if you've been following the show, you know
[04:37.960 --> 04:41.680]  that I am breeding with a Jack the Ripper male, I've put that Jack the Ripper male to
[04:41.680 --> 04:43.920]  many of my favorite females.
[04:43.920 --> 04:45.560]  The seeds are hard.
[04:45.560 --> 04:46.560]  They're nice and dark.
[04:46.560 --> 04:47.560]  They're nice and striped.
[04:47.560 --> 04:48.880]  They are almost done.
[04:48.880 --> 04:49.880]  I'm not ready.
[04:49.880 --> 04:50.880]  At the time of recording.
[04:50.880 --> 04:52.840]  I'm not ready to cut those plants down yet.
[04:52.920 --> 04:56.720]  But by the time this show comes out, those plants may have been harvested.
[04:56.720 --> 05:01.080]  They're going to hang for about 10 days, maybe 14 days, they'll get nice and dry.
[05:01.080 --> 05:04.480]  Once the buds are crispy dry, I'll shut the buds off into a container.
[05:04.480 --> 05:05.880]  I'll crush them up real fine.
[05:05.880 --> 05:07.840]  And then I'll run it through the seed sorting machine.
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.440]  And we will have some seeds at that point I will select a batch.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.800]  And based on Colorado limits, I will find how many I can put in my grow, I will germinate
[05:16.800 --> 05:21.120]  that many also find a couple of local friends who need new seeds in their garden, and I
[05:21.120 --> 05:24.360]  will give them a couple of seeds and they won't know what they've got.
[05:24.360 --> 05:27.080]  They'll know it's a Jack the Ripper cross, they won't know it's cross to they'll know
[05:27.080 --> 05:28.880]  it's a surprise and a tester.
[05:28.880 --> 05:29.880]  They'll get those seeds.
[05:29.880 --> 05:32.720]  So myself and a couple of my local friends will grow these out.
[05:32.720 --> 05:36.480]  Once we establish that they are a hit or a miss, then we will move forward.
[05:36.480 --> 05:38.600]  I don't know if I've just just made a bunch of crap.
[05:38.600 --> 05:41.240]  Or if I've just made a bunch of gems or somewhere in the middle.
[05:41.240 --> 05:45.760]  We have got to grow them and find out before I release any of them to the general public
[05:45.760 --> 05:49.160]  for you guys to get your hands on I want to make sure it is a quality product.
[05:49.160 --> 05:50.400]  I put my name on my products.
[05:50.400 --> 05:52.320]  I put my company name on my products.
[05:52.320 --> 05:55.080]  I'm not going to release some whack untested bullshit.
[05:55.080 --> 05:56.360]  I don't know what I've got.
[05:56.360 --> 05:59.680]  So I will test them once I realize that they are good or they're bad.
[05:59.680 --> 06:03.320]  We will continue with testing or we will flush them down the toilet if they're terrible seeds,
[06:03.320 --> 06:04.320]  they go bye bye.
[06:04.320 --> 06:05.320]  That's just what happens.
[06:05.320 --> 06:09.400]  But if I find good phenotypes, if I find reliable progeny, if they have a good germ rate, if
[06:09.400 --> 06:13.080]  there's no mutants, no hermaphrodites, they will reach the market.
[06:13.080 --> 06:14.800]  They will take a long time to get there.
[06:14.800 --> 06:18.640]  I've got to test them, then they will get to other testers once other testers have them
[06:18.640 --> 06:23.480]  and they've completed a nine or 10 week flowering process, then we will consider a real release.
[06:23.480 --> 06:27.000]  So you guys, it is going to be quite a ways away before those seeds are ready.
[06:27.000 --> 06:28.200]  I keep saying that on the show.
[06:28.200 --> 06:32.600]  I have to give that disclaimer every time I talk about these seeds, but they are fat.
[06:32.600 --> 06:33.600]  They're looking around.
[06:33.600 --> 06:34.600]  They're looking right.
[06:34.600 --> 06:35.980]  They're nice dark colors.
[06:35.980 --> 06:39.400]  Some of those Jack the Ripper phenotypes smell amazing.
[06:39.400 --> 06:42.120]  There's one in there that I was trying to come up with an aroma.
[06:42.120 --> 06:44.160]  I rubbed my fingers, I gave it a nice sniff.
[06:44.160 --> 06:49.560]  I said it's like lemons and limes, but it also has a dairy product to it that I kind
[06:49.560 --> 06:50.560]  of enjoy.
[06:50.560 --> 06:52.960]  I was thinking about it and I said lemon meringue.
[06:52.960 --> 06:56.200]  And then as I smelled my fingers and I went about my day, it came to me.
[06:56.200 --> 06:57.640]  It's tastes and smells.
[06:57.640 --> 06:58.720]  It smells, I haven't tasted it yet.
[06:58.720 --> 07:02.440]  So it tastes, it smells like a key lime pie.
[07:02.440 --> 07:06.640]  So I've got a Jack the Ripper phenotype that smells just like key lime pie.
[07:06.640 --> 07:10.860]  I've crossed that Jack the Ripper to a Jack the Ripper male to make F2.
[07:10.860 --> 07:12.440]  We will see what comes out of that.
[07:12.440 --> 07:16.960]  I'm kind of excited just because that one new aroma in the room really got my attention.
[07:16.960 --> 07:23.120]  There is also a pollinated lemon skunk that smells even better now that it's pollinated.
[07:23.120 --> 07:24.680]  I haven't gotten this aroma out of it before.
[07:24.680 --> 07:28.160]  I've pollinated it with several other things, but it's making a new smell.
[07:28.160 --> 07:33.000]  Also I'm growing it under LED so that new aroma may be coming from the LED lighting.
[07:33.000 --> 07:34.600]  I am excited about these Jack the Rippers.
[07:34.600 --> 07:36.560]  That's why I'm rambling about it.
[07:36.560 --> 07:38.640]  If you've been following along, you know how excited I've been.
[07:38.640 --> 07:40.960]  You know how excited a lot of my listeners are.
[07:40.960 --> 07:41.960]  They're almost done.
[07:42.480 --> 07:43.480]  I'm excited to cut them down.
[07:43.480 --> 07:46.000]  As soon as I start germinating them, you guys will get updates.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.320]  As soon as people are growing them, you will see photos.
[07:48.320 --> 07:49.880]  I'm sure you're as excited as I am.
[07:49.880 --> 07:50.880]  So stay tuned.
[07:50.880 --> 07:53.440]  That is my Jack the Ripper update.
[07:53.440 --> 07:54.440]  Where else are we?
[07:54.440 --> 07:55.440]  I think this is the point.
[07:55.440 --> 07:57.000]  Oh, I wanted to remind you that it is a hot, hot day.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.080]  If you haven't figured out how to deal with your hot, hot grow rooms, now is the time.
[08:01.080 --> 08:02.080]  Figure that out.
[08:02.080 --> 08:03.080]  You need air conditioners.
[08:03.080 --> 08:04.080]  It was hot today.
[08:04.080 --> 08:05.680]  It is still hot today.
[08:05.680 --> 08:07.000]  I just wrote down super hot day.
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.920]  I think in the intro I was supposed to say coming at you on a super hot day is what I
[08:09.920 --> 08:11.000]  wrote that for.
[08:11.040 --> 08:12.040]  It's hot, you guys.
[08:12.040 --> 08:13.040]  Damn.
[08:13.040 --> 08:14.040]  That's why I'm all red and sweaty.
[08:14.040 --> 08:15.040]  It is hot.
[08:15.040 --> 08:16.040]  All right.
[08:16.040 --> 08:17.040]  We're going to jump into the email portion of this show.
[08:17.040 --> 08:19.520]  I feel like I'm nice and rambly off those dabs.
[08:19.520 --> 08:23.720]  If you would like to send me an email, if you have a cannabis culture or cannabis cultivation
[08:23.720 --> 08:28.040]  question, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[08:28.040 --> 08:30.840]  I'd love answering listener generated content.
[08:30.840 --> 08:33.240]  So today's email starts off just like this.
[08:33.240 --> 08:37.440]  It says, first of all, call me asmogrows.
[08:37.440 --> 08:38.440]  I think there was a correction here.
[08:38.440 --> 08:40.240]  It might be amosgrows or asmogrows.
[08:40.480 --> 08:43.760]  I know I got another message, but this is from our friend, agrows.
[08:43.760 --> 08:45.840]  We're going to call you because I don't know how to say it.
[08:45.840 --> 08:47.760]  I'm less about hearing my name.
[08:47.760 --> 08:50.160]  Oh, they're less about hearing their name and more about getting my thoughts.
[08:50.160 --> 08:51.320]  So I didn't get your name right.
[08:51.320 --> 08:52.800]  But here comes the important part.
[08:52.800 --> 08:57.080]  I've been checking your show out since someone in the DGC suggested it, suggested listening
[08:57.080 --> 08:58.800]  to it a few years ago.
[08:58.800 --> 08:59.800]  That's awesome.
[08:59.800 --> 09:01.680]  The DGC tends to give me a lot of new listeners.
[09:01.680 --> 09:02.680]  So thank you guys.
[09:02.680 --> 09:03.680]  I appreciate that.
[09:03.680 --> 09:06.480]  It says, I didn't personally notice a thing with the lapel mic.
[09:06.480 --> 09:08.920]  So go for it if it makes you more productive.
[09:08.920 --> 09:11.920]  So our friend is referring to when I was rocking the lapel mic, which I've decided
[09:11.920 --> 09:15.480]  not to use for a couple of episodes until I can play with it, learn it a little better.
[09:15.480 --> 09:17.280]  But they did not notice anything.
[09:17.280 --> 09:22.840]  What I did notice when I listened to the episode on multiple devices, on phones and computers,
[09:22.840 --> 09:25.480]  it sounds like shit, but if you got headphones in, it sounds okay.
[09:25.480 --> 09:28.480]  It just sounds like I'm a little bit further away if you're using a phone or something
[09:28.480 --> 09:29.480]  like that.
[09:29.480 --> 09:30.480]  So I did notice a difference.
[09:30.480 --> 09:32.680]  That's why I'm using the good mic today.
[09:32.680 --> 09:33.680]  Let's see.
[09:33.680 --> 09:34.680]  It goes, all right.
[09:34.680 --> 09:35.680]  My question.
[09:35.680 --> 09:37.360]  First, have you ever worked with any medicinal strains?
[09:37.360 --> 09:39.260]  And if so, which ones?
[09:39.260 --> 09:44.880]  I asked due to having lost my father-in-law today to lung cancer.
[09:44.880 --> 09:47.480]  Man, I am sorry to hear that you lost somebody today.
[09:47.480 --> 09:48.480]  That's still fresh.
[09:48.480 --> 09:49.480]  It still hurts.
[09:49.480 --> 09:51.280]  I'm sorry that you have lost somebody to lung cancer.
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.080]  It says, I also have a cousin with COPD.
[09:55.080 --> 09:56.960]  That's a chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder.
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.520]  And it says, and I know how cannabis has helped with my TBI and chronic pain.
[10:01.520 --> 10:03.000]  And yes, this cousin does not smoke.
[10:03.000 --> 10:04.520]  He uses medibles now.
[10:04.520 --> 10:07.880]  I'm just looking for the upcoming holiday season.
[10:07.880 --> 10:11.760]  So the main question here is, have you ever worked with any medicinal strains?
[10:11.760 --> 10:15.040]  And if so, which ones?
[10:15.040 --> 10:16.680]  That's a really unique and interesting question.
[10:16.680 --> 10:21.800]  And without sounding condescending, my real answer is all cannabis is medical.
[10:21.800 --> 10:23.320]  All strains are medicinal.
[10:23.320 --> 10:27.520]  They all hold a medicinal value, a medical property to them.
[10:27.520 --> 10:33.180]  The thing is finding the strain that has the property for the ailment, which you seek to
[10:33.180 --> 10:37.500]  cure or treat or treat, I guess is the right word here.
[10:37.500 --> 10:41.140]  So in my opinion, all cannabis is medical.
[10:41.140 --> 10:45.100]  On the same side of that or the opposite side, maybe the same side, what do they say?
[10:45.100 --> 10:50.180]  The same side of that, the other side of that coin, all cannabis is also recreational.
[10:50.180 --> 10:51.740]  You smoke and you feel better.
[10:51.740 --> 10:56.100]  So you're better, you're medically better, and now you can recreate, you can enjoy life.
[10:56.100 --> 10:57.900]  So I think that all cannabis is medical.
[10:57.900 --> 11:02.200]  If it makes you feel better in any sort of way, and we would smoke cannabis on a daily
[11:02.200 --> 11:05.160]  basis if we didn't feel better, I feel just fine.
[11:05.160 --> 11:06.800]  Most of the time I start off, I'm like, I'm cool.
[11:06.800 --> 11:09.120]  I take a dab and I'm like, I feel fucking great.
[11:09.120 --> 11:11.700]  So it's medical or recreational.
[11:11.700 --> 11:12.700]  It makes you feel better.
[11:12.700 --> 11:13.700]  And that's what medicine does.
[11:13.700 --> 11:17.400]  And if you've got an ailment or a condition like that traumatic brain injury, you and
[11:17.400 --> 11:19.320]  I have both experienced traumatic brain injuries.
[11:19.320 --> 11:21.760]  We've got things going on in our heads that aren't right.
[11:21.760 --> 11:23.920]  Sometimes it's cannabis makes those things right.
[11:23.920 --> 11:27.000]  So that is medicine.
[11:27.000 --> 11:28.000]  So which strains?
[11:28.000 --> 11:29.000]  All of them.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.220]  So the trick is finding the strain that works for your condition.
[11:32.220 --> 11:33.960]  We don't all have the same body chemistry.
[11:33.960 --> 11:35.480]  We don't all have the same ailments.
[11:35.480 --> 11:36.880]  We don't all have the same.
[11:36.880 --> 11:38.660]  We're all different is what I'm trying to say.
[11:38.660 --> 11:39.920]  And so are cannabis strains.
[11:39.920 --> 11:41.680]  So you've got to match up.
[11:41.680 --> 11:45.920]  We know that some strains work well, like CBD works well for some things, THC works
[11:45.920 --> 11:49.220]  well for some things, but a lot of it is going to be you specifically.
[11:49.220 --> 11:53.960]  So you've got to experiment, find a strain that is readily available, consistently available,
[11:53.960 --> 11:55.320]  and see if that strain works for you.
[11:55.320 --> 11:58.660]  If not, switch it up, try another one and try two or three times.
[11:59.320 --> 12:01.780]  Smoke that strain a couple of times in different environments, different settings, and see
[12:01.780 --> 12:03.140]  if that's the medical strain for you.
[12:03.140 --> 12:05.700]  A lot of people, this thing happens.
[12:05.700 --> 12:09.300]  When you find a medical strain that works for you, like you could smoke weed your whole
[12:09.300 --> 12:10.300]  life.
[12:10.300 --> 12:15.520]  And then one day you hit a strain and you go, oh dude, I'm fucking my whatever was bothering
[12:15.520 --> 12:16.520]  me just quit.
[12:16.520 --> 12:20.260]  My brain injury just quit skipping or my fucking weird twitch in my arm just quit twitching.
[12:20.260 --> 12:22.380]  My weird tick in my face, I just quit ticking.
[12:22.380 --> 12:26.760]  Like you notice it when you find the right medicine, you notice it immediately.
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.240]  Most consumers and medical patients, they usually notice, they go, dude, that's the
[12:30.240 --> 12:31.240]  medicine.
[12:31.240 --> 12:32.240]  Can I have a clone?
[12:32.240 --> 12:33.240]  Can I get seeds?
[12:33.240 --> 12:34.240]  Please don't ever stop growing this.
[12:34.240 --> 12:35.480]  This makes me feel good.
[12:35.480 --> 12:37.500]  So all cannabis is medical.
[12:37.500 --> 12:39.080]  All cannabis is recreational.
[12:39.080 --> 12:45.360]  The thing is finding what will separate them is clean and healthily grown and safely grown,
[12:45.360 --> 12:49.840]  non-contaminated, non-pesticide laden product.
[12:49.840 --> 12:53.680]  Something that's been dried and cured properly, something that isn't moldy and got spider
[12:53.680 --> 12:56.680]  mites and spider mite eggs and thrips shit all over it.
[12:56.720 --> 12:59.000]  Something that was not sprayed with terrible pesticides.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.440]  And I know I talk about my integrated pest management system and I apply a lot of products
[13:03.440 --> 13:07.200]  to my grow, but I understand exactly what I'm applying.
[13:07.200 --> 13:12.520]  I understand when I am applying it and I understand the risks involved and the timeframes.
[13:12.520 --> 13:16.440]  And also I'm trained by the Colorado Department of Agriculture to understand what I'm doing
[13:16.440 --> 13:17.520]  to these plants.
[13:17.520 --> 13:19.000]  I don't feel I am causing danger.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.640]  I feel I am keeping the plants safe and healthy.
[13:21.640 --> 13:25.460]  The products I apply are gone from the plant long before harvest.
[13:25.460 --> 13:26.940]  So that's what you need.
[13:26.940 --> 13:30.860]  Somebody who cares about the person consuming it growing that product.
[13:30.860 --> 13:32.660]  That's what makes it medicinal.
[13:32.660 --> 13:37.980]  Also a reliable strain selection is something that comes into play when it is medical cannabis.
[13:37.980 --> 13:43.460]  We need to go to our dispensary, our friend, whoever, wherever you're getting it.
[13:43.460 --> 13:46.220]  We need to get this same product reliably.
[13:46.220 --> 13:47.860]  That's what keeps us in good shape.
[13:47.860 --> 13:51.760]  So that's where medical cannabis comes in is finding somebody that can provide you that
[13:51.760 --> 13:55.300]  medicinal relief on a consistent safe basis.
[13:55.300 --> 13:57.780]  We also need consistency and repeatable outcomes.
[13:57.780 --> 14:01.860]  We need that grower to do that same thing over and over for you.
[14:01.860 --> 14:03.540]  That's one of the problems with medical cannabis.
[14:03.540 --> 14:06.700]  You go to a dispensary and they've got this product today and you love it.
[14:06.700 --> 14:07.700]  You buy an ounce of it.
[14:07.700 --> 14:09.140]  You feel great for a couple of days.
[14:09.140 --> 14:12.140]  Once that runs out, you go back and they're like, oh, that was from another vendor.
[14:12.140 --> 14:13.820]  We don't even know who that came from.
[14:13.820 --> 14:14.820]  That product is gone.
[14:14.820 --> 14:15.820]  You can't get it anymore.
[14:15.820 --> 14:17.580]  And now you have to start your quest over.
[14:17.580 --> 14:18.860]  So that's frustrating.
[14:18.860 --> 14:21.980]  That's why I see a lot of people turning to growing their own medicine.
[14:21.980 --> 14:22.980]  That is the way to do it.
[14:22.980 --> 14:24.740]  And that sounds like that's what you're working toward.
[14:24.740 --> 14:25.860]  So let me touch on this part.
[14:25.860 --> 14:27.660]  The cousin with COPD.
[14:27.660 --> 14:30.300]  I definitely recommend making edibles for that person.
[14:30.300 --> 14:35.460]  You can use if you grow flowers for yourself to smoke, you can use your trim and your leftover
[14:35.460 --> 14:37.940]  stuff to make edibles for your cousin.
[14:37.940 --> 14:41.460]  And then you can both treat yourselves and you don't feel like you're short any flowers.
[14:41.460 --> 14:43.820]  Take off all the big leaves, all the stuff you trim off.
[14:43.820 --> 14:47.860]  If it's got any crystals in it, put that in a pile and you can use that to make butter
[14:47.860 --> 14:51.420]  or you can make a concentrate and then you can put that concentrate into your food.
[14:51.420 --> 14:53.340]  There are a lot of things you can do with that trim.
[14:53.340 --> 14:57.940]  Also, you can make edibles straight out of your flowers if that's what you want to do.
[14:57.940 --> 14:59.900]  But that's a lot of contribution.
[14:59.900 --> 15:01.580]  You may want to smoke that yourself.
[15:01.580 --> 15:05.340]  So your main question is, have I ever worked with any medical strains?
[15:05.340 --> 15:06.860]  And if so, which ones?
[15:06.860 --> 15:09.020]  All of them are medical, in my opinion.
[15:09.020 --> 15:12.460]  I do want to apologize to you losing your father again that your father in law that
[15:12.460 --> 15:15.100]  sounds traumatic, especially the lung cancer.
[15:15.100 --> 15:16.100]  That sounds terrible.
[15:16.100 --> 15:17.100]  I'm sorry, bro.
[15:17.100 --> 15:18.900]  Big hug, big fist bump.
[15:18.900 --> 15:21.340]  And awesome for trying to take care of your cousin with COPD.
[15:21.340 --> 15:22.340]  That's pretty cool.
[15:22.340 --> 15:24.500]  I hope you're able to make them some edibles.
[15:24.500 --> 15:26.060]  You've got to grow a crop.
[15:26.060 --> 15:27.940]  You've got to trim it, dry it, and cure it.
[15:27.940 --> 15:32.300]  And then make something out of either the flowers or the trim and get some edibles to
[15:32.300 --> 15:33.300]  your cousin.
[15:33.300 --> 15:34.780]  That will work very well for your cousin.
[15:34.780 --> 15:39.300]  My advice though is make sure they know that they are getting medicated food when you feed
[15:39.300 --> 15:40.300]  them.
[15:40.300 --> 15:41.860]  Don't just pass them a cookie and be like, you'll feel good after that.
[15:41.860 --> 15:43.460]  Be like, hey, there's weed in that cookie.
[15:43.460 --> 15:46.940]  Eat like a quarter of it and make sure they eat a quarter of it and not the whole fucking
[15:46.940 --> 15:48.060]  thing and then watch them.
[15:48.060 --> 15:49.300]  See if they're cool.
[15:49.300 --> 15:52.260]  It's your responsibility at this point to make sure they are comfortable, safe, and
[15:52.260 --> 15:54.660]  happy because you're the one giving them a new product.
[15:54.660 --> 15:55.660]  You're taking them down a path.
[15:55.660 --> 15:57.900]  You've got to hold their hand the entire fucking way.
[15:57.900 --> 15:59.700]  So don't give them too much.
[15:59.700 --> 16:01.660]  Eat about a quarter of that cookie.
[16:01.660 --> 16:02.660]  Maybe eat an eighth of the cookie.
[16:02.660 --> 16:03.660]  I don't know how big the cookie is.
[16:03.660 --> 16:05.540]  I'm just kind of ballparking it here.
[16:05.540 --> 16:07.020]  Eat a little bit of that cookie.
[16:07.020 --> 16:08.020]  Wait a few minutes.
[16:08.020 --> 16:09.020]  Wait like an hour.
[16:09.020 --> 16:10.500]  If nothing's happening, maybe eat a little bit more.
[16:10.500 --> 16:12.540]  If nothing happens, wait two hours.
[16:12.540 --> 16:15.500]  Don't eat the whole cookie thinking there ain't shit happening because what you can
[16:15.500 --> 16:20.180]  do is you can get this person into edibles and you can scare them off of edibles forever.
[16:20.180 --> 16:22.100]  The very first time they try it, they're scared.
[16:22.100 --> 16:26.420]  They had a bad experience, had a panic attack, saw Jesus, fucking saw the devil at the same
[16:26.420 --> 16:27.420]  time.
[16:27.420 --> 16:28.420]  They don't want to go back there.
[16:28.420 --> 16:29.420]  Fuck you and your edibles.
[16:29.420 --> 16:32.340]  Go lightly so we don't scare them away so that we've got the opportunity to actually
[16:32.340 --> 16:35.260]  help your cousin.
[16:35.260 --> 16:37.580]  That I think will cover most of that part.
[16:37.580 --> 16:38.860]  There is a second half.
[16:38.860 --> 16:44.220]  It says, secondly, how can a grower accentuate the terpene expression the breeder put in there?
[16:44.260 --> 16:50.260]  I try using homemade compost, life, Bokashi, recharge, and bio-biz plus Epsom salts.
[16:50.260 --> 16:52.860]  I use fish and seaweed once a week as a treat too.
[16:52.860 --> 16:55.140]  Is there more I can do to increase the funk?
[16:55.140 --> 16:57.660]  Okay, now, okay, and there's yes at the end.
[16:57.660 --> 17:00.060]  If you need any testers, I am more than willing to help.
[17:00.060 --> 17:02.100]  All right, so testers are coming up.
[17:02.100 --> 17:03.820]  I talked about that a moment ago.
[17:03.820 --> 17:08.140]  Let's talk about accentuating terpene expression that the breeder put in there.
[17:08.140 --> 17:11.980]  I don't know that I put it in there, but I know that it is potentially there and you
[17:11.980 --> 17:13.380]  want to unlock it.
[17:13.380 --> 17:17.060]  The best way to do that, it's not going to only be nutrients.
[17:17.060 --> 17:20.420]  It sounds like you've got a good idea of feeding them a bunch of good shit, homemade compost,
[17:20.420 --> 17:23.820]  life, Bokashi, recharge, bio-biz, Epsom salts.
[17:23.820 --> 17:25.220]  It sounds like a good balance.
[17:25.220 --> 17:26.700]  Fish and seaweed, add a little funk.
[17:26.700 --> 17:33.060]  That's always going to help with you, but it's all about the lights, air, water, soil
[17:33.060 --> 17:34.060]  while it's growing.
[17:34.060 --> 17:35.060]  You got to have the laws.
[17:35.060 --> 17:36.660]  The main thing's got to be handled.
[17:36.660 --> 17:37.660]  Are the lights good?
[17:37.660 --> 17:38.660]  Is the air good?
[17:38.660 --> 17:39.660]  Are you watering properly?
[17:39.660 --> 17:40.660]  Are you feeding properly?
[17:40.660 --> 17:41.660]  Is the soil good?
[17:41.660 --> 17:45.740]  All of those things play a factor into the flavor while you're growing.
[17:45.740 --> 17:47.260]  All of those matter, not just a couple.
[17:47.260 --> 17:48.460]  It's like a chessboard.
[17:48.460 --> 17:51.780]  If you don't focus on this corner of the chessboard, you're not going to get checkmate because
[17:51.780 --> 17:54.340]  the king's just going to hustle over there.
[17:54.340 --> 17:57.540]  You got to pay attention to the whole chessboard if you want to get that fucking checkmate.
[17:57.540 --> 18:00.700]  You can't just focus on a couple squares because then that knight's going to sneak up and get
[18:00.700 --> 18:01.700]  you.
[18:01.700 --> 18:04.720]  You got to get everything dialed in during the grow process.
[18:04.720 --> 18:05.720]  This starts in veg.
[18:05.720 --> 18:07.340]  A lot of people overlook veg.
[18:07.340 --> 18:08.520]  Veg is very important.
[18:08.520 --> 18:11.680]  Without a healthy plant, without a good foundation, your flowering plant is going to be a weak
[18:11.680 --> 18:12.680]  piece of shit.
[18:12.680 --> 18:15.920]  So veg hard, veg strong, flower strong.
[18:15.920 --> 18:17.320]  Everyday counts.
[18:17.320 --> 18:18.320]  Everyday in there counts.
[18:18.320 --> 18:20.940]  You got what, 65 days of flower make everyday count.
[18:20.940 --> 18:23.160]  Do something in there to make that garden better.
[18:23.160 --> 18:26.380]  Also, stay out of the way and don't do too much to make that garden better, but be on
[18:26.380 --> 18:27.600]  top of your shit.
[18:27.600 --> 18:28.600]  Get it going.
[18:28.600 --> 18:32.560]  Then here's where we really bring out the turps is in the dry and cure process.
[18:32.560 --> 18:37.020]  If you're not, you can grow the best product on the fucking planet, but if you don't dry
[18:37.020 --> 18:39.740]  it and cure it properly, it's not going to taste good.
[18:39.740 --> 18:40.740]  It's not going to burn right.
[18:40.740 --> 18:42.040]  It won't be worth a shit.
[18:42.040 --> 18:47.360]  So I think where you need to maybe potentially work on a couple things is the dry and cure
[18:47.360 --> 18:48.360]  process.
[18:48.360 --> 18:51.940]  I think that drying and curing slowly will really help you out.
[18:51.940 --> 18:55.400]  I've done a full episode on drying and curing, so I'm not going to go too deep into it now,
[18:55.400 --> 18:57.420]  but I mainly cut down the whole plant.
[18:57.420 --> 19:00.960]  I cut off all the fan leaves and then I let it hang until the sticks pop.
[19:00.960 --> 19:04.300]  Once my sticks are popping, that is when it is time to trim it and start drying it up
[19:04.300 --> 19:06.620]  and curing it or jarring it up and curing it.
[19:06.620 --> 19:10.680]  I don't want the sticks to explode when I bend them, but if the main stocks of the plant
[19:10.680 --> 19:14.300]  are really dry and they go crunch when you pop them, that's about time to start working
[19:14.300 --> 19:15.500]  at the smaller stems.
[19:15.500 --> 19:16.680]  They should be snappy and poppy.
[19:16.680 --> 19:18.740]  You want that main one to do a little bit of pop.
[19:18.740 --> 19:21.100]  If the buds are getting too dry, speed that up.
[19:21.100 --> 19:22.100]  Start this ahead.
[19:22.100 --> 19:23.100]  I don't know your environment.
[19:23.100 --> 19:26.900]  I don't know how big your plants are, but you want the buds slightly spongy, but not
[19:26.900 --> 19:31.960]  squishy, not moist, not damp, but a little spongy and the stems should pop.
[19:31.960 --> 19:34.380]  Then we're going to cut the buds off the sticks at that point.
[19:34.380 --> 19:38.420]  Then we'll trim them up real good and then we'll put them into a container loosely packed
[19:38.420 --> 19:39.420]  and seal them up.
[19:39.420 --> 19:43.180]  Then we're going to check on them in like two hours and see if they're really moist
[19:43.180 --> 19:47.940]  because a lot of times we can reconstitute the flowers and just move that moisture around
[19:47.940 --> 19:50.020]  and just by trapping it in that container.
[19:50.020 --> 19:51.020]  Now we need to check on it.
[19:51.020 --> 19:52.100]  Where is that moisture gone?
[19:52.100 --> 19:54.080]  What level of moisture are we sitting at?
[19:54.080 --> 19:55.080]  Give it a squeeze.
[19:55.080 --> 19:56.080]  Give it a touch.
[19:56.080 --> 19:57.780]  How wet, how sticky does it feel?
[19:57.780 --> 19:58.780]  Use your judgment.
[19:58.780 --> 20:01.840]  Does it feel like if you seal it up, it's going to create a problem or does it feel
[20:01.840 --> 20:05.800]  like if you leave it open for a couple of hours, it'll be better when you close it.
[20:05.800 --> 20:09.200]  That's when you start sealing it for an hour or two, opening it back up and checking on
[20:09.200 --> 20:10.200]  it.
[20:10.200 --> 20:13.480]  Then slowly over time, increase the amount of time you leave it sealed.
[20:13.480 --> 20:16.960]  First do an hour or two, check on it, move the buds around, make sure they're not moldy,
[20:16.960 --> 20:19.720]  make sure they're not sticking together, make sure they're not getting funky.
[20:19.720 --> 20:23.240]  If it smells like ammonia or it's got like a sharp smell coming out of there, you sealed
[20:23.240 --> 20:24.760]  it up for too long.
[20:24.760 --> 20:28.280]  Make sure you open it up, get some air out of there, get some fresh air in there, seal
[20:28.280 --> 20:29.620]  it back up.
[20:29.620 --> 20:32.060]  Start with like an hour, check it again in two hours.
[20:32.060 --> 20:36.380]  Do that for a couple of hours, two hours, two hours, two hours until you're not so paranoid.
[20:36.380 --> 20:40.860]  Then the next, maybe two days later, maybe the next day, do it every four hours.
[20:40.860 --> 20:45.140]  Then the next day, maybe do it every five or six hours and slowly increase your time.
[20:45.140 --> 20:46.300]  You'll be able to tell.
[20:46.300 --> 20:50.180]  You don't want the buds to be wet enough to cause a problem inside that jar, but we want
[20:50.180 --> 20:54.100]  them to have moisture to create the chemical reaction that leads to the curing process.
[20:54.100 --> 20:56.180]  I'll talk really briefly about that.
[20:56.180 --> 20:59.100]  We're trying to remove chlorophyll from our plants.
[20:59.100 --> 21:00.980]  Chlorophyll is what makes them burn shitty, taste funny.
[21:00.980 --> 21:01.980]  We don't want to smoke chlorophyll.
[21:01.980 --> 21:05.120]  We want to get that out of the vegetative part of the plant.
[21:05.120 --> 21:09.740]  We need moisture and air and darkness to create that reaction.
[21:09.740 --> 21:14.180]  When we close the buds up in the jar, that air stays inside of the jar and there becomes
[21:14.180 --> 21:17.380]  an anaerobic condition inside of that jar.
[21:17.380 --> 21:21.340]  Those anaerobes eat the chlorophyll and the chlorophyll turns to a gas.
[21:21.340 --> 21:27.180]  When we open the jar, that gas escapes and we put fresh air in there to repeat the process.
[21:27.180 --> 21:30.060]  Without moisture, that process will not happen.
[21:30.060 --> 21:35.340]  We need enough moisture to trigger the anaerobes, but we don't need so much moisture as to trigger
[21:35.340 --> 21:38.100]  mold and problems inside that jar.
[21:38.100 --> 21:40.860]  That is the scientific reason of why we are curing.
[21:40.860 --> 21:45.260]  We're using the anaerobes that we create in that jar to break down the chlorophyll, to
[21:45.260 --> 21:48.220]  turn the chlorophyll into a gas to get it out of our plants.
[21:48.220 --> 21:49.580]  That is the main goal.
[21:49.580 --> 21:55.660]  I would say a proper dry and cure will probably greatly increase the terpenes, the fucking
[21:55.660 --> 21:58.700]  burnability, the enjoyment of your product.
[21:58.700 --> 22:05.700]  You'll also get a better buzz because now as the bud cures, the cannabinoids, so let
[22:05.700 --> 22:08.820]  me see if I can get this right without any notes.
[22:08.820 --> 22:15.300]  The THC molecule drops, the THC drops a water molecule and becomes more psychoactive.
[22:15.300 --> 22:19.060]  Don't ask me to testify on that a little deeper because that's memory in the back of my head
[22:19.060 --> 22:20.500]  and we're just going to move forward.
[22:20.500 --> 22:24.100]  It will become more potent, it'll taste better, it'll burn more smoothly, and you will enjoy
[22:24.100 --> 22:25.100]  your cannabis more.
[22:25.100 --> 22:28.860]  I think the best way to get those terps out is a better dry and cure.
[22:28.860 --> 22:30.660]  I'm not dissing your dry and cure method now.
[22:30.660 --> 22:34.820]  I don't know what you're doing, but I'm sure a better dry and cure will bring out better
[22:34.820 --> 22:35.820]  terps.
[22:35.820 --> 22:38.140]  All right, let's see what else we got for that email.
[22:38.140 --> 22:39.900]  I think that is all we've got for that one.
[22:39.900 --> 22:41.420]  I want to thank my friend.
[22:41.420 --> 22:44.460]  It looks like it says, I'm going to try to read your name again, dude.
[22:44.460 --> 22:46.700]  Nope, I'm not going to, but thank you for the message.
[22:46.700 --> 22:49.020]  I know you sent me another message with a key on how to read it.
[22:49.020 --> 22:51.100]  I got to find that one and give you a proper shout out.
[22:51.100 --> 22:52.100]  Thank you for the message.
[22:52.100 --> 22:55.060]  If anybody else out there has an email, of course it is growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[22:56.020 --> 22:57.980]  I'm going to work my way into this next message.
[22:57.980 --> 23:03.180]  This one comes from Ryan, and it says, Rasta Jeff, I'm wondering how similar the seeds
[23:03.180 --> 23:06.700]  produced by a feminized plant resemble the mother.
[23:06.700 --> 23:09.180]  Does any variation happen, or are there more?
[23:09.180 --> 23:11.340]  Are they more like clones of the mother?
[23:11.340 --> 23:16.420]  I'm thinking of feminizing one of a particular pheno of a cross I did, and I want to retain
[23:16.420 --> 23:19.060]  its characteristics, specifically the terpene.
[23:19.060 --> 23:21.220]  This episode's all about the terps, it sounds like.
[23:21.220 --> 23:23.860]  It has a great strawberry Jolly Rancher aroma.
[23:24.580 --> 23:27.460]  Then it says, I did take clones, so I have those at least.
[23:27.460 --> 23:29.420]  Thanks from our friend Ryan.
[23:29.420 --> 23:36.020]  So the main question here is, are seeds produced by a feminized plant, do they resemble the
[23:36.020 --> 23:37.140]  mother?
[23:37.140 --> 23:41.580]  I have got two answers for you, because there are two ways to make feminized seeds, and
[23:41.580 --> 23:43.900]  I'm not sure which one you're attempting to do.
[23:43.900 --> 23:47.060]  I've talked before about S1 and R1 seeds.
[23:47.060 --> 23:48.820]  We'll talk briefly about each one.
[23:48.820 --> 23:51.780]  S1, that is a selfing seed, a selfed plant.
[23:51.820 --> 23:55.740]  I've described that one as you take one plant, you take two clones, and then you reverse
[23:55.740 --> 24:00.260]  one clone, and you use that pollen from that reverse clone to put on the same cultivar,
[24:00.260 --> 24:01.540]  and now we have selfed it.
[24:01.540 --> 24:06.140]  Your golden goat plant has fucked itself and made golden goat seeds.
[24:06.140 --> 24:07.380]  That is one parent.
[24:07.380 --> 24:14.700]  So we are going to see mostly, and I'm estimating here, we're going to see about 60% of the
[24:14.700 --> 24:19.540]  phenotypes are going to look mostly like the golden goat, because we haven't introduced
[24:19.540 --> 24:20.820]  any genetics here.
[24:20.860 --> 24:24.100]  It's just golden goat, but golden goat has parents.
[24:24.100 --> 24:25.460]  Golden goat isn't one plant.
[24:25.460 --> 24:27.580]  Golden goat was made from two plants.
[24:27.580 --> 24:30.700]  Golden goat actually has grandparents and great-grandparents, but we're going to stay
[24:30.700 --> 24:32.020]  more focused here.
[24:32.020 --> 24:38.860]  We're going to see about phenotypes that have representations of the grandparents, of the
[24:38.860 --> 24:40.100]  parents of golden goat.
[24:40.100 --> 24:44.300]  So you may see the island sweet skunk to Hawaiian sativa to the Romulan, or how is it?
[24:44.300 --> 24:46.420]  Island sweet skunk, Hawaiian sativa, Romulan.
[24:46.420 --> 24:50.260]  Anyway, you may see one side of that golden goat cross, and you may see the other parent
[24:50.260 --> 24:53.300]  of the golden goat cross pop up in some phenotypes.
[24:53.300 --> 24:58.540]  You're going to get 60% of the phenotypes will look just like the original golden goat.
[24:58.540 --> 25:03.960]  Then you will get 20% that lean a little bit one way, and 20% that lean a little bit one
[25:03.960 --> 25:06.580]  way toward the golden goat parents.
[25:06.580 --> 25:11.740]  Depending on the genetics, the dominance of those genetics, and the cross, and how everything
[25:11.740 --> 25:17.420]  falls genetically on the gambling chart, you may get 90% that look just like the golden
[25:17.420 --> 25:20.980]  goat, but you've got the potential to see some of the parents.
[25:20.980 --> 25:24.100]  You've got about 20% each way to see some of the parents.
[25:24.100 --> 25:25.780]  That is just how genetics work.
[25:25.780 --> 25:29.300]  From what I've seen in my S1s, that is basically my experience.
[25:29.300 --> 25:33.880]  About 60% of them look just like the plant they came from, and 40% of them are going
[25:33.880 --> 25:36.340]  to show minor variation.
[25:36.340 --> 25:39.980]  Unless you're the breeder, unless you were really familiar with the original parent plant,
[25:39.980 --> 25:42.260]  you're not going to notice much variation.
[25:42.260 --> 25:44.620]  What you're doing is for preservation.
[25:44.820 --> 25:47.900]  Since you bred this cross, you know exactly what you're looking for.
[25:47.900 --> 25:52.060]  When it comes time to pull that phenotype out of it again, you've got a 60% chance of
[25:52.060 --> 25:56.500]  getting that, and you know what to look for, so you will find it.
[25:56.500 --> 25:58.760]  That's an S1.
[25:58.760 --> 26:00.780]  These are my numbers from my experience.
[26:00.780 --> 26:05.260]  60%, and then 40% are going to show slight variation, but not too much.
[26:05.260 --> 26:09.780]  You'll get 20% toward one parent, 20% toward the other, but still you're mostly going to
[26:09.780 --> 26:13.900]  see that golden goat dominance in those progeny.
[26:13.900 --> 26:16.300]  Let's talk on R1 now.
[26:16.300 --> 26:17.860]  R1s have two parents.
[26:17.860 --> 26:23.900]  An R1 would be if I took golden goat and reversed it and put that golden goat pollen on lemon
[26:23.900 --> 26:26.100]  skunk and then we make lemon Jeffrey.
[26:26.100 --> 26:27.380]  That is an R1.
[26:27.380 --> 26:31.940]  Since we've got two parents, and also don't forget four grandparents and however many
[26:31.940 --> 26:35.900]  great-grandparents, and it keeps going, there are more pieces to this puzzle.
[26:35.900 --> 26:42.780]  We're going to see, basically in my opinion, from my experience, we see 50% of those phenotypes
[26:42.780 --> 26:47.060]  look like a 50-50 combo of the plants we bred.
[26:47.060 --> 26:52.100]  You see lemon skunk and you see golden goat, 50% of the offspring look like a 50-50 combo,
[26:52.100 --> 26:54.060]  that perfect lemon Jeffrey phenotype.
[26:54.060 --> 27:00.060]  Then, in my experience, I see about 20% that are dominant toward the mom.
[27:00.060 --> 27:02.220]  They look a little bit more like the mom.
[27:02.220 --> 27:05.460]  Then I see 20% that are a little bit more like the dad.
[27:05.460 --> 27:07.900]  They kind of represent dad a little bit more.
[27:07.900 --> 27:11.560]  Then there's a 10% batch in there, which I call the outliers.
[27:11.560 --> 27:16.480]  They maybe show too much of the mom or too much of the dad, or perhaps they're showing
[27:16.480 --> 27:20.480]  me some of their grandparents that I'm not too familiar with because I don't have that
[27:20.480 --> 27:24.040]  much history on some of these strains.
[27:24.040 --> 27:29.720]  On the R1s, I think you're going to see 50% of 50-50 combos.
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.640]  You took A and B, you're going to get 50% of them that look like AB.
[27:33.640 --> 27:38.400]  Then you're going to see 20% that look a little bit more like A, and you'll have 20% that
[27:38.400 --> 27:43.240]  look a little bit more like B. However, they're really close to that 50-50 still, just little
[27:43.240 --> 27:44.240]  minor variations.
[27:44.240 --> 27:49.400]  Then, like I said before, we're going to find the outliers, the things that are very similar,
[27:49.400 --> 27:50.960]  but they're showing me weirdness.
[27:50.960 --> 27:54.240]  They're showing maybe a little bit more of the golden goat, maybe a little bit more of
[27:54.240 --> 27:59.640]  the lemon skunk, or maybe some of them are showing me part of the Romulan on that golden
[27:59.640 --> 28:01.640]  goat side, the parent from the golden goat.
[28:01.640 --> 28:03.400]  Maybe they're showing me the island sweet skunk.
[28:03.400 --> 28:05.260]  Maybe they'll show me Hawaiian sativa.
[28:05.260 --> 28:10.180]  I've got potential to see all of the grandparents at this time.
[28:10.180 --> 28:11.660]  Let me recap real quickly.
[28:11.660 --> 28:17.100]  S1s, you're going to get 60% that look like the parents, and 20% either way that are going
[28:17.100 --> 28:20.020]  to lean a little bit more toward one parent.
[28:20.020 --> 28:24.140]  The R1s, you're going to get 50% that look like the 50-50 combo, and then you're going
[28:24.140 --> 28:29.220]  to get 20% that lean toward mom, 20% that lean toward dad, and 10% that are a little
[28:29.220 --> 28:33.180]  bit outliers, but will still be desirable phenotypes in my opinion.
[28:33.180 --> 28:36.540]  That's where some people find the fucking amazing gems.
[28:36.540 --> 28:38.060]  I hope I answered your question, Ryan.
[28:38.060 --> 28:42.060]  That is the difference between S1s and R1s, and that is what you should expect to find
[28:42.060 --> 28:43.300]  in your progeny.
[28:43.300 --> 28:46.260]  If you have any more questions about this breeding project, I would love to help you
[28:46.260 --> 28:47.260]  out.
[28:47.260 --> 28:48.260]  Please reach out.
[28:48.260 --> 28:49.260]  Send me another email.
[28:49.260 --> 28:50.260]  I'll get you going on the right path.
[28:50.260 --> 28:51.860]  It sounds like you've really thought this out and you know what you're doing.
[28:51.860 --> 28:53.700]  I'm excited to see how it goes for you.
[28:53.700 --> 28:57.380]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[28:57.380 --> 29:01.020]  and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers, all you sexy motherfuckers out there, I want
