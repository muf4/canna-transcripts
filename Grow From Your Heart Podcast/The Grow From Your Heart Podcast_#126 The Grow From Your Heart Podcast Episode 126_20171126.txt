[00:17.340 --> 00:19.980]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:19.980 --> 00:21.940]  It's time for episode number 126
[00:21.940 --> 00:23.780]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.780 --> 00:27.900]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:27.900 --> 00:29.140]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:29.140 --> 00:30.780]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:30.780 --> 00:33.060]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:33.060 --> 00:34.340]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:34.340 --> 00:35.620]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:35.620 --> 00:37.340]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:37.340 --> 00:40.060]  this my friends is the podcast for you.
[00:40.060 --> 00:42.020]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeffo
[00:42.020 --> 00:43.740]  and I thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.740 --> 00:45.980]  Also, I wanna thank my buddy White Mike
[00:45.980 --> 00:46.820]  for joining me again.
[00:46.820 --> 00:47.660]  How are you doing today, brother?
[00:47.660 --> 00:48.860]  Doing good, man, how are you?
[00:48.860 --> 00:49.700]  I am doing good.
[00:49.700 --> 00:52.020]  Now that we got this recording equipment figured out.
[00:52.020 --> 00:54.700]  Yeah, we spent some time working on the sound
[00:54.700 --> 00:56.820]  so that this sounded great for all of you out there.
[00:56.820 --> 00:59.220]  For some reason, 126 episodes into the show,
[00:59.220 --> 01:01.020]  I opened up the recording software and hit go
[01:01.020 --> 01:02.380]  and the recording equipment
[01:02.380 --> 01:03.780]  was just giving me the middle finger.
[01:03.780 --> 01:05.420]  It was like, no, not today.
[01:05.420 --> 01:07.700]  Took a couple of dry runs to get her going.
[01:07.700 --> 01:08.620]  You know. Sounding right.
[01:08.620 --> 01:10.300]  I got her fired up, it's working good.
[01:10.300 --> 01:12.180]  I think I've done more damage to my head
[01:12.180 --> 01:14.140]  working on this podcast than I did at like
[01:14.140 --> 01:16.140]  all of the concerts I saw in my early twenties.
[01:16.180 --> 01:17.020]  Working well.
[01:17.020 --> 01:18.180]  I just said it's working good.
[01:18.180 --> 01:19.820]  It's working well.
[01:19.820 --> 01:22.060]  Let's work on our English skills today, class.
[01:22.060 --> 01:25.100]  Yeah, I apologize for the other headphone malfunctions there.
[01:25.100 --> 01:25.940]  No, we're good.
[01:25.940 --> 01:27.460]  I don't know what was going on with this equipment today.
[01:27.460 --> 01:28.980]  It was super loud and then it was super quiet
[01:28.980 --> 01:31.900]  and then it was extra loud and you guys don't care.
[01:31.900 --> 01:33.060]  You guys just want a quality show.
[01:33.060 --> 01:34.460]  So let's get into that part.
[01:36.500 --> 01:38.220]  We're gonna read some news articles.
[01:38.220 --> 01:40.260]  We may actually play a news article,
[01:40.260 --> 01:43.700]  but first let's talk about another email
[01:43.740 --> 01:46.340]  that I did not include in the last episode.
[01:46.340 --> 01:47.740]  I think it might've been a Facebook message
[01:47.740 --> 01:48.580]  is why I missed it.
[01:48.580 --> 01:50.900]  Shout out to our friend Rasta Seb.
[01:50.900 --> 01:52.620]  Rasta Seb has had a little bit of bad luck,
[01:52.620 --> 01:54.140]  but things will turn around for your brother.
[01:54.140 --> 01:55.780]  I feel bad for what happened to you,
[01:55.780 --> 02:00.700]  but Rasta Seb sent me a question asking, what is reclaim?
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.660]  And we can't laugh at the guy.
[02:01.660 --> 02:04.260]  We gotta remember not everybody is smoking
[02:04.260 --> 02:06.500]  four and five grams of hash on their day off.
[02:06.500 --> 02:07.340]  Not everybody lives in Colorado.
[02:07.340 --> 02:08.420]  No, perfectly valid question.
[02:08.420 --> 02:09.460]  Completely good question.
[02:09.460 --> 02:10.420]  No giggles at all.
[02:10.420 --> 02:12.220]  Most people, well, yeah, a lot of people in Colorado
[02:12.220 --> 02:13.180]  would be like, well, what's reclaim?
[02:13.700 --> 02:14.580]  Well, reclaim is this bro.
[02:14.580 --> 02:16.900]  So for all you folks out there who are not able
[02:16.900 --> 02:18.700]  to consume a whole bunch of Earl.
[02:20.420 --> 02:21.780]  Spoiled hash brat.
[02:23.660 --> 02:25.540]  I talked to people all day who have,
[02:25.540 --> 02:27.660]  like I don't even bother to get to reclaim with them
[02:27.660 --> 02:29.980]  because like I already gave them a thesaurus
[02:29.980 --> 02:31.140]  worth of fucking information.
[02:31.140 --> 02:33.420]  The look on Mike's face was priceless here.
[02:33.420 --> 02:36.100]  Okay, so let me tell you what reclaim is.
[02:36.100 --> 02:37.380]  When we use a dab rig,
[02:37.380 --> 02:40.180]  we put a nail attached to the rig somehow.
[02:40.180 --> 02:42.140]  It either sits on the outside of a male joint
[02:42.140 --> 02:43.780]  or it sits on the inside of the male joint
[02:43.780 --> 02:45.380]  and then you put a dome on it.
[02:45.380 --> 02:46.700]  Either way, you heat up that nail
[02:46.700 --> 02:49.540]  and then you put some hash onto there and you inhale.
[02:49.540 --> 02:52.860]  And as you inhale, some of that hash oil
[02:52.860 --> 02:54.500]  will collect onto your rig
[02:54.500 --> 02:57.140]  just like the resin collects on your pipe.
[02:57.140 --> 02:58.420]  They doing good so far, Mike?
[02:58.420 --> 02:59.300]  Yeah. Okay.
[02:59.300 --> 03:02.020]  Just as we vaporize the hash before it all gets to us,
[03:02.020 --> 03:05.140]  some of it unvaporizes and reconstitutes itself
[03:05.140 --> 03:05.980]  in a reclaim.
[03:05.980 --> 03:08.980]  Yeah, and then a lot of times that'll fill up in,
[03:08.980 --> 03:13.980]  if you're smoking BHO, I highly recommend you using a rig.
[03:14.060 --> 03:15.500]  We call the rig a pipe.
[03:15.500 --> 03:16.340]  It's a bong, you guys.
[03:16.340 --> 03:17.160]  It's a small bong.
[03:17.160 --> 03:18.340]  I like a little small bubbler.
[03:18.340 --> 03:20.060]  A special little hash bong, yeah.
[03:20.060 --> 03:22.100]  We call it a rig, but I like something small.
[03:22.100 --> 03:24.420]  I highly recommend you smoke with something
[03:24.420 --> 03:25.260]  with water in it.
[03:25.260 --> 03:27.020]  You want that bubble action to cool it down.
[03:27.020 --> 03:28.060]  The hash is really hot.
[03:28.060 --> 03:28.940]  Just cool it a little bit
[03:28.940 --> 03:30.220]  before it gets to your lungs and throat.
[03:30.220 --> 03:31.940]  It'll really help you out.
[03:31.940 --> 03:34.740]  So a lot of times a water will collect
[03:34.740 --> 03:36.640]  a lot of reclaim in there.
[03:36.640 --> 03:38.140]  So there's a lot of claim in the water.
[03:38.140 --> 03:41.380]  There's a lot of claim on the entryway to the pipe.
[03:41.380 --> 03:43.540]  A lot of times I'll use what's called a drop down.
[03:43.540 --> 03:46.420]  I'm grabbing my drop down right now to get a nice visual.
[03:46.420 --> 03:48.060]  The drop down goes onto the rig
[03:48.060 --> 03:49.540]  where the nail would normally go.
[03:49.540 --> 03:51.360]  And it's an extension of glass.
[03:51.360 --> 03:52.680]  It'll actually go a little lower
[03:52.680 --> 03:54.460]  to get the nail out of your face a little bit
[03:54.460 --> 03:56.060]  and get it further away from your head.
[03:56.060 --> 03:57.660]  And then the nail goes on there.
[03:57.660 --> 03:59.860]  And then a lot of the oil,
[03:59.860 --> 04:01.820]  the reclaim oil will collect right into here.
[04:01.820 --> 04:03.620]  And there's some here that we can talk about.
[04:03.620 --> 04:04.580]  There's, I don't know,
[04:04.580 --> 04:07.400]  that's probably a measurement of one dram,
[04:07.480 --> 04:10.080]  one half dram I think is what that would be probably
[04:10.080 --> 04:10.920]  if you poured it out.
[04:10.920 --> 04:11.760]  It'd be half a dram.
[04:11.760 --> 04:13.480]  One of those little tiny vials?
[04:13.480 --> 04:14.320]  Yeah.
[04:14.320 --> 04:15.580]  They'd be half of one of those is what I think.
[04:15.580 --> 04:18.000]  So I've got a half a dram of reclaim
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.120]  that I could remove from here and do something with.
[04:21.120 --> 04:22.160]  So that's what reclaim is.
[04:22.160 --> 04:24.480]  It's basically reconstituted hash oil
[04:24.480 --> 04:25.720]  that's stuck to my piece.
[04:26.680 --> 04:29.720]  What can you do with it was one of his followup questions.
[04:29.720 --> 04:32.600]  I've seen people just stick the dabber
[04:32.600 --> 04:35.880]  inside of this mookie part and pull it out and redab it.
[04:35.880 --> 04:36.960]  Some people will do that.
[04:37.480 --> 04:39.040]  Our friend 44, he would do that.
[04:39.040 --> 04:41.040]  That's not against his standards.
[04:41.040 --> 04:44.460]  Lots of people go for dabbing it.
[04:44.460 --> 04:47.960]  I know a lot of people who take great care to clean it out
[04:47.960 --> 04:50.360]  and then try to like dry it out.
[04:50.360 --> 04:52.480]  Drying it out is the part that I would make sure
[04:52.480 --> 04:53.360]  you do really well.
[04:53.360 --> 04:56.480]  Leave it on some parchment paper or on an oil slick pad
[04:56.480 --> 04:57.760]  and make sure you let it dry really well
[04:57.760 --> 04:59.080]  before you try to dab it again.
[04:59.080 --> 05:01.080]  I talked to one dude who was cleaning his rig
[05:01.080 --> 05:04.960]  with Everclear so that he could throw that
[05:04.960 --> 05:07.080]  into a glass dish when he was done agitating
[05:07.080 --> 05:08.280]  and getting his rig all clean
[05:08.280 --> 05:10.360]  and then slowly evaporate that back down
[05:10.360 --> 05:12.760]  into like reclaim powder.
[05:12.760 --> 05:15.400]  I think our friend Gary was teaching me
[05:15.400 --> 05:16.280]  about that a while back.
[05:16.280 --> 05:17.120]  So shout out Gary.
[05:17.120 --> 05:18.160]  I'm not sure if you still listen to the show,
[05:18.160 --> 05:20.440]  but he was talking about doing something very similar.
[05:20.440 --> 05:24.240]  Our friend Fox with CBD, CBD extracts run CBD.
[05:24.240 --> 05:27.200]  I think what he would say would be to make edibles out of it.
[05:27.200 --> 05:30.960]  Yep, that's another use that I know a number of people do.
[05:30.960 --> 05:34.840]  It's already been decarboxylized or decarboxylated?
[05:35.600 --> 05:36.440]  Ized.
[05:36.440 --> 05:37.280]  Ized, okay.
[05:37.280 --> 05:38.680]  You look like you just picked one.
[05:38.680 --> 05:39.760]  I was gonna say you just picked one.
[05:39.760 --> 05:41.560]  I said them both in my head and I was like,
[05:41.560 --> 05:43.120]  no, the first one sounds like.
[05:43.120 --> 05:45.680]  It's been decarbed because it's been heated
[05:45.680 --> 05:47.840]  to a temperature above a certain, beyond four,
[05:47.840 --> 05:49.520]  it's been heated, I don't even know how hot the surface
[05:49.520 --> 05:50.360]  of this nail is.
[05:50.360 --> 05:51.200]  It is really hot, but it's been heated above that.
[05:51.200 --> 05:52.800]  Significantly over 100 degrees.
[05:52.800 --> 05:55.640]  And it's reconstituted, so it's been activated essentially.
[05:55.640 --> 05:57.320]  So when you eat it, it's already broken down
[05:57.320 --> 05:59.920]  so that your body doesn't have to break it down as much
[05:59.920 --> 06:03.720]  to make the psychoactive components bioavailable.
[06:03.720 --> 06:05.320]  I don't know why that was deep on accident.
[06:05.320 --> 06:07.120]  But okay, so that's what Reclaim is.
[06:08.280 --> 06:10.120]  I may be an asshole because what I do with it
[06:10.120 --> 06:12.240]  is I fill my rig with rubbing alcohol
[06:12.240 --> 06:13.240]  and I shake it up real good
[06:13.240 --> 06:15.520]  and then I pour that shit down the drain.
[06:15.520 --> 06:17.000]  And ironically, for some reason,
[06:17.000 --> 06:18.760]  my garbage disposal doesn't work.
[06:18.760 --> 06:21.360]  It's too high, bro.
[06:21.360 --> 06:23.000]  I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat anything
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.340]  that would really clog that thing up.
[06:24.340 --> 06:25.640]  I don't put anything down there.
[06:25.640 --> 06:26.680]  I just need some love.
[06:26.680 --> 06:28.880]  I'm like 90% sure I need to pour a bottle of ISO
[06:28.880 --> 06:30.720]  down my garbage disposal.
[06:30.720 --> 06:32.880]  I think that's my only problem is it's just all resiny.
[06:32.880 --> 06:35.360]  I got a whole bunch of Reclaim in there.
[06:35.360 --> 06:37.960]  Nine times out of 10, I do the same thing.
[06:37.960 --> 06:40.480]  If I've got a big fat glob of Reclaim
[06:40.480 --> 06:42.880]  sitting somewhere that's easy to get to,
[06:42.880 --> 06:45.840]  I'll use my torch to extract it real quick.
[06:45.840 --> 06:46.680]  Just kind of heat it up.
[06:46.680 --> 06:48.000]  Just heat it up a little bit.
[06:48.000 --> 06:49.920]  Turn it into basically a liquid, yeah,
[06:49.920 --> 06:52.560]  and then pour it into a silicone container.
[06:52.560 --> 06:55.620]  And I use it for seasoning my nail.
[06:55.620 --> 06:56.920]  That's a great use for it.
[06:56.920 --> 06:59.680]  Honestly, it's the only reason I keep it around.
[06:59.720 --> 07:01.760]  And so I only do it when I've got
[07:01.760 --> 07:03.440]  like a really fat glob sitting there
[07:03.440 --> 07:04.700]  because what I've got now,
[07:04.700 --> 07:06.560]  I could season a hundred nails with.
[07:06.560 --> 07:08.040]  So we're gonna get another question.
[07:08.040 --> 07:10.500]  What the hell does he mean, season your nail?
[07:10.500 --> 07:12.160]  When you get a new titanium nail,
[07:12.160 --> 07:14.480]  just like any skillet that you would wanna cook on,
[07:14.480 --> 07:15.600]  any pan that you're gonna cook on,
[07:15.600 --> 07:18.720]  you're gonna wanna put some oil or fatty substance on it
[07:18.720 --> 07:20.420]  to grease it up before you cook on it
[07:20.420 --> 07:24.040]  so that you don't taste that iron, that cast iron.
[07:24.040 --> 07:26.040]  You don't wanna taste cast iron on whatever you're cooking.
[07:26.040 --> 07:28.160]  If you're making some asparagus in there,
[07:28.160 --> 07:29.520]  if you're making pork chops,
[07:30.360 --> 07:31.200]  you don't wanna taste fucking cast iron
[07:31.200 --> 07:32.920]  and you don't wanna just taste raw titanium.
[07:32.920 --> 07:34.280]  So when I get a new nail,
[07:34.280 --> 07:36.720]  I'll heat it up just to about dab temperature
[07:36.720 --> 07:40.000]  and I'll let it cool so that the oil will puddle on there
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.780]  and kind of soak into the pores of the nail.
[07:42.780 --> 07:45.420]  So you wanna kind of season your nail
[07:45.420 --> 07:47.520]  before you start dabbing with the brand new titanium nail.
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.000]  And you can do it with quartz also.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.120]  Once you get a quartz nail perfectly seasoned,
[07:51.120 --> 07:53.280]  it's so smooth and tastes really, really nice.
[07:53.280 --> 07:56.320]  I finally got to hit a really nice quartz banger recently
[07:56.320 --> 07:58.280]  and it tasted really good.
[07:58.280 --> 08:02.400]  Shout out to Bobo Blaster Co. and The Traveling Stoner
[08:02.400 --> 08:05.120]  and Sloppy919 and whoever else,
[08:05.120 --> 08:07.080]  Buzzy probably was in the house.
[08:07.080 --> 08:07.920]  Shout out to the whole crew.
[08:07.920 --> 08:09.440]  They got to take some dabs.
[08:09.440 --> 08:10.800]  I know where you were, bro.
[08:12.160 --> 08:13.200]  Did I give a shout out to Lindsey?
[08:13.200 --> 08:14.040]  Yes, I did.
[08:14.040 --> 08:15.800]  I gave a shout out to Lindsey on the last episode.
[08:15.800 --> 08:16.640]  Lindsey.
[08:16.640 --> 08:17.460]  The episode came out really well.
[08:17.460 --> 08:18.440]  You did a great job on the show.
[08:18.440 --> 08:19.600]  And Mike, you were awesome also.
[08:19.600 --> 08:22.480]  We're gonna get Mike and Lindsey back on another episode.
[08:22.480 --> 08:24.400]  A listener sent a Facebook message.
[08:24.400 --> 08:25.640]  You know, I wasn't even prepared for this.
[08:25.640 --> 08:26.480]  Let me grab my phone
[08:26.480 --> 08:28.320]  and read a Facebook message right quick.
[08:28.320 --> 08:30.080]  Yeah, that was a fun show to record.
[08:30.080 --> 08:32.600]  I got some good feedback on it from some people.
[08:32.600 --> 08:35.040]  This Facebook message stemmed from that episode.
[08:35.040 --> 08:36.280]  I'm pulling it up on my phone right now.
[08:36.280 --> 08:37.120]  This is impromptu.
[08:37.120 --> 08:38.080]  I was not prepared to talk.
[08:38.080 --> 08:40.060]  I was gonna wait till you guys were both here,
[08:40.060 --> 08:43.640]  but it seems like a fair time to mention this.
[08:43.640 --> 08:44.480]  Here we go.
[08:44.480 --> 08:48.560]  This comment, she said, oh, and she has replied to my reply.
[08:48.560 --> 08:49.960]  She said, I listened to this podcast
[08:49.960 --> 08:52.040]  and was sad to hear that the libertarian candidates
[08:52.040 --> 08:54.240]  were ignored or were entirely ignored.
[08:54.240 --> 08:56.720]  Gary Johnson is way better than Sanders on cannabis.
[08:56.720 --> 08:58.580]  Johnson, besides owning an extract company,
[08:58.580 --> 09:00.000]  even admits to using cannabis.
[09:00.000 --> 09:03.840]  So when Hillary beats Bernie, which she will,
[09:03.840 --> 09:05.200]  and then she leaves us a link to follow
[09:05.200 --> 09:09.020]  so that we can read about a libertarian future.
[09:09.960 --> 09:13.000]  No, I'm very familiar with Gary Johnson.
[09:13.000 --> 09:14.840]  I'm a big fan.
[09:14.840 --> 09:16.100]  I'm just a realist.
[09:17.440 --> 09:21.880]  Gary's awesome, but Gary don't have a shot.
[09:21.880 --> 09:24.240]  She said, thanks, I'm actually rooting for Bernie
[09:24.240 --> 09:27.600]  for the Dem nomination, but my heart is with Gary Johnson.
[09:27.600 --> 09:31.280]  And she said, it's not totally impossible for Gary Johnson.
[09:31.280 --> 09:33.960]  So I don't know enough about that to have an opinion.
[09:33.960 --> 09:34.800]  It sounds like Mike does.
[09:34.800 --> 09:37.760]  What I do have an opinion on is that,
[09:37.760 --> 09:39.200]  Elizabeth, I appreciate your interaction
[09:39.200 --> 09:40.480]  with the podcast on Facebook.
[09:40.480 --> 09:41.360]  Keep it up.
[09:41.360 --> 09:42.440]  If you ever have any more questions
[09:42.440 --> 09:43.280]  or anything you'd like to say,
[09:43.280 --> 09:45.240]  feel free to throw it up there on the Facebook.
[09:45.240 --> 09:46.080]  I like it.
[09:46.080 --> 09:47.560]  Thank you.
[09:48.080 --> 09:51.360]  The libertarian candidate is typically far better
[09:51.360 --> 09:54.040]  on marijuana policy than the Democrat
[09:54.040 --> 09:56.200]  or the Republican candidates,
[09:56.200 --> 09:59.000]  but they don't have a shot right now.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.040]  We just don't have that third party infrastructure
[10:01.040 --> 10:02.220]  in the United States.
[10:03.280 --> 10:04.320]  Sorry.
[10:04.320 --> 10:05.160]  I like it.
[10:05.160 --> 10:06.280]  I didn't do it.
[10:06.280 --> 10:07.760]  Mike knows a lot of political shit.
[10:07.760 --> 10:09.740]  You're a buzzword champion, bro.
[10:09.740 --> 10:11.040]  I listened to the episode,
[10:11.040 --> 10:12.360]  because of course I cleaned them up a little bit
[10:12.360 --> 10:13.200]  before I put them out.
[10:13.200 --> 10:14.360]  If anybody pauses for too long
[10:14.360 --> 10:16.660]  or says shit they want taken out, I'll cut it out for them.
[10:16.660 --> 10:18.260]  Listening back to that episode,
[10:18.260 --> 10:19.380]  you were buzzword king.
[10:19.380 --> 10:20.340]  It was like, ding, ding, ding.
[10:20.340 --> 10:21.860]  You're just getting my mind every time.
[10:21.860 --> 10:22.700]  Nice.
[10:22.700 --> 10:23.540]  That's awesome.
[10:24.540 --> 10:25.460]  We talked about reclaim.
[10:25.460 --> 10:27.300]  Shout out to Rasta Seb.
[10:27.300 --> 10:28.760]  Hey, Seb, I owe you one, bro.
[10:28.760 --> 10:31.700]  You helped me out one time by contributing to the podcast.
[10:31.700 --> 10:33.420]  It looks like you may be in a time of need.
[10:33.420 --> 10:35.060]  If there's anything that Mike and I can do for you.
[10:35.060 --> 10:37.420]  Mike, I just volunteered your services to my buddy.
[10:37.420 --> 10:39.380]  If we can do anything for you, bro, let me know.
[10:39.380 --> 10:40.500]  I owe you one.
[10:40.500 --> 10:41.540]  I don't know what we could do,
[10:41.540 --> 10:43.100]  but if something comes up that you think of,
[10:43.100 --> 10:44.940]  send me an email, send me a Facebook message.
[10:44.940 --> 10:45.780]  We'll get it on.
[10:46.980 --> 10:49.420]  Our next article, our next topic
[10:49.420 --> 10:50.740]  is going to be a positive thing.
[10:50.740 --> 10:52.400]  And I'm gonna go to the internet for this one.
[10:52.400 --> 10:55.500]  We're actually going to play a quick video clip
[10:55.500 --> 10:59.520]  from Channel 13 News here in Pueblo, Colorado
[10:59.520 --> 11:00.740]  and Colorado Springs.
[11:01.620 --> 11:03.580]  It says I should give credit to Katie Spencer,
[11:03.580 --> 11:05.460]  who is a multimedia journalist.
[11:07.020 --> 11:09.780]  The cannabis clubs in Colorado Springs
[11:09.780 --> 11:12.200]  united and did something great.
[11:13.140 --> 11:15.800]  They were giving away free joints
[11:15.840 --> 11:17.800]  to people who volunteered.
[11:17.800 --> 11:19.600]  Was this all of them or was this some of them?
[11:19.600 --> 11:20.480]  Just a small group.
[11:20.480 --> 11:21.700]  There was a group of them.
[11:21.700 --> 11:22.960]  I know.
[11:22.960 --> 11:24.280]  Okay, so there was more than one?
[11:24.280 --> 11:25.760]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it was more than one.
[11:25.760 --> 11:27.240]  The article should tell us,
[11:27.240 --> 11:29.800]  but I saw our friends from one shop posting about it
[11:29.800 --> 11:32.780]  and I saw the guy on this news articles from another shop.
[11:32.780 --> 11:35.520]  So I don't know how many of the places participated,
[11:35.520 --> 11:36.680]  but I'll play the news article for you.
[11:36.680 --> 11:39.680]  But what they did was they were giving away a free joint
[11:39.680 --> 11:42.080]  if you participated in their litter cleanup program.
[11:42.080 --> 11:43.940]  If you went and picked up one bag of trash
[11:43.980 --> 11:46.300]  and brought it back to the organizer of this event,
[11:46.300 --> 11:47.580]  he would give you a free joint.
[11:47.580 --> 11:49.660]  And there's an image of him standing here.
[11:49.660 --> 11:51.300]  Unfortunately, he's standing in the park
[11:51.300 --> 11:53.860]  with a bowl of tube tubes full of joints.
[11:53.860 --> 11:55.340]  He's got the, the joints aren't exposed.
[11:55.340 --> 11:56.180]  They're in little containers.
[11:56.180 --> 11:58.740]  Right, like if I would have organized this event,
[11:58.740 --> 12:00.620]  it would be an organized slightly different,
[12:00.620 --> 12:03.260]  but I love it for what it is
[12:03.260 --> 12:04.780]  and what it did for the community.
[12:04.780 --> 12:06.460]  It's a very good idea.
[12:06.460 --> 12:08.020]  It's not a hundred percent,
[12:08.020 --> 12:10.180]  like put your best foot forward necessarily
[12:10.180 --> 12:11.560]  as far as optics go.
[12:12.160 --> 12:14.200]  But I love it.
[12:14.200 --> 12:16.920]  Do joints for picking up trash all the way.
[12:17.800 --> 12:19.120]  Clean everything up.
[12:19.120 --> 12:20.040]  I wonder if you could smoke the joint
[12:20.040 --> 12:20.960]  while you pick up trash,
[12:20.960 --> 12:22.560]  cause that'd make it a lot better.
[12:22.560 --> 12:23.760]  Sure it would.
[12:23.760 --> 12:24.720]  No, you can't do that though.
[12:24.720 --> 12:26.000]  Not legally in Colorado.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.640]  That's the whole thing with handing it out.
[12:27.640 --> 12:28.920]  Cause I'm sure plenty of people did that.
[12:28.920 --> 12:31.480]  Like it was just bring me a bag of trash, get a joint.
[12:31.480 --> 12:32.680]  I'm sure there were plenty of people
[12:32.680 --> 12:34.640]  who brought him several bags of trash.
[12:34.640 --> 12:37.000]  I wonder how many people went and cleaned out their car.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.040]  I hope not many.
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.240]  But I'd like to see more of the industry
[12:43.240 --> 12:44.240]  doing stuff like that.
[12:44.240 --> 12:48.160]  Like the consumption clubs can really push the boundaries
[12:48.160 --> 12:50.400]  with like giving away product and stuff like that.
[12:50.400 --> 12:53.200]  Like the shops can't even give away product legally.
[12:53.200 --> 12:54.720]  They have to charge at least a penny.
[12:54.720 --> 12:56.920]  Right, the only way a dispensary would be able to do that
[12:56.920 --> 12:58.880]  would to be if they checked your ID
[12:58.880 --> 13:00.840]  before they let you sign up for the program
[13:00.840 --> 13:03.040]  and then they would have to give you a coupon
[13:03.040 --> 13:04.920]  that may give you a joint for a penny
[13:04.920 --> 13:06.800]  because they can't give you anything for free.
[13:07.280 --> 13:09.720]  And so then you'd have to go back to that shop
[13:09.720 --> 13:12.040]  and get the joint for a penny with your coupon.
[13:12.040 --> 13:13.600]  But then didn't you just technically,
[13:13.600 --> 13:16.120]  you're employed by that dispensary if that happens.
[13:16.120 --> 13:17.560]  You're like kind of.
[13:17.560 --> 13:20.760]  Not really, cause they're just handing out coupons.
[13:20.760 --> 13:23.000]  Who they hand coupons to,
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.600]  I don't know if you could claim that's employment,
[13:24.600 --> 13:28.040]  but like I'm sure that a stink would get raised
[13:28.040 --> 13:30.000]  if a dispensary actually did that.
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.520]  Oh yeah, too many hoops to jump through for the dispensary.
[13:32.520 --> 13:33.920]  Nobody would take tax money on it.
[13:33.920 --> 13:36.600]  Right, all sorts of things.
[13:37.440 --> 13:39.040]  The shop would have to pay the taxes on that
[13:39.040 --> 13:41.400]  as though it's sold at normal price.
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.080]  I bet would be the bite that the shop would have to take.
[13:45.080 --> 13:46.760]  But there's a shop down here
[13:46.760 --> 13:48.680]  that's adopted a strip of highway
[13:48.680 --> 13:50.520]  and I drive that strip of highway every day
[13:50.520 --> 13:51.920]  and it's always fucking filthy
[13:51.920 --> 13:54.960]  and I shake my head every time I drive and see that sign.
[13:54.960 --> 13:56.360]  So they need to get out there and clean it up
[13:56.360 --> 13:57.840]  if that's their part of the highway.
[13:57.840 --> 14:00.280]  Their little redheaded stepchild part of the highway
[14:00.280 --> 14:01.120]  is all dirty.
[14:01.120 --> 14:04.680]  Yep, get out there and fulfill your obligation
[14:04.680 --> 14:09.400]  and shout out to the consumption clubs that did this event.
[14:09.400 --> 14:12.000]  I wish more of the industry was thinking of stuff like this
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.960]  to help clean up or better
[14:13.960 --> 14:15.960]  their little part of the community.
[14:15.960 --> 14:17.840]  All right, I'm gonna play the video.
[14:17.840 --> 14:19.000]  I gotta get the volumes correct.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.600]  I apologize if things go wonky here.
[14:20.600 --> 14:21.680]  I don't know how loud this is gonna be
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.840]  because it is coming from the News 13 website.
[14:24.840 --> 14:26.200]  We'll deal with it, here we go.
[14:26.200 --> 14:27.760]  Well, Colorado Springs Cannabis Club
[14:27.760 --> 14:29.980]  offering free marijuana today.
[14:29.980 --> 14:32.160]  To those who helped pick up trash,
[14:32.160 --> 14:33.680]  dozens of volunteers showed up
[14:33.680 --> 14:35.680]  to help the Pothole Cannabis Club
[14:35.680 --> 14:38.080]  clean up Vermejo Park and other areas
[14:38.080 --> 14:40.920]  and KRDO News Channel 13's Katie Spencer tagged along.
[14:40.920 --> 14:42.160]  It's new at five o'clock.
[14:43.600 --> 14:45.680]  The goal of Sunday's get together,
[14:45.680 --> 14:48.000]  making Colorado Springs more beautiful
[14:48.000 --> 14:50.320]  one trash bag at a time.
[14:50.320 --> 14:51.560]  We're gonna go out here on the west side
[14:51.560 --> 14:53.680]  and clean up down here off of Cimarron
[14:53.680 --> 14:56.480]  and the park off of 26th.
[14:56.480 --> 14:59.000]  The effort started here at Vermejo Park
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.640]  where volunteers were picking up trash for a unique reward.
[15:04.480 --> 15:06.120]  As you bring bags of trash back to me,
[15:06.120 --> 15:09.200]  I'm gonna give you a joint per bag you bring back.
[15:09.200 --> 15:10.600]  But for those cleaning up,
[15:10.600 --> 15:13.400]  it wasn't just about the free weed.
[15:13.400 --> 15:14.760]  I hike every single day
[15:14.760 --> 15:17.800]  and I see trash on every single trail and it saddens me.
[15:17.800 --> 15:20.560]  It was a personal connection to their home.
[15:20.560 --> 15:24.520]  So it feels good to actually go pick the trash up.
[15:24.520 --> 15:28.240]  You know, I don't mind it because I used the trail.
[15:28.240 --> 15:31.080]  Cleaning up the park as well as the reputation
[15:31.080 --> 15:33.080]  of the marijuana industry.
[15:33.080 --> 15:35.480]  To show that we are a positive impact.
[15:35.480 --> 15:36.880]  You know, there's nothing wrong with weed
[15:36.880 --> 15:39.440]  and there's nothing wrong with our kind of people.
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.960]  In Colorado Springs, Katie Spencer, KRDO News Channel 13.
[15:43.960 --> 15:44.800]  They picked up a lot of trash.
[15:44.800 --> 15:46.840]  The club hopes to continue the cleanups every month
[15:46.840 --> 15:49.600]  and move to other parts of the city.
[15:49.600 --> 15:51.360]  Yep, so every month that'd be cool
[15:51.360 --> 15:53.560]  to see people picking up trash for pot.
[15:53.560 --> 15:54.400]  Yep.
[15:54.400 --> 15:55.560]  Yeah, so that shows you guys,
[15:55.560 --> 15:57.000]  we're not just a bunch of lazy stoners.
[15:57.000 --> 15:58.600]  We do contribute to the community.
[15:58.600 --> 15:59.600]  We want it to be cleaner.
[15:59.600 --> 16:01.400]  We're at the park chilling out, enjoying our buzz.
[16:01.400 --> 16:02.240]  We want it to be clean.
[16:02.240 --> 16:04.120]  We don't want to look around and see trash everywhere.
[16:04.120 --> 16:04.960]  Right?
[16:04.960 --> 16:07.720]  There's this weird myth out there
[16:07.720 --> 16:10.240]  that because we're associated with marijuana,
[16:10.240 --> 16:13.200]  like we want everything to be bad and destroyed
[16:13.200 --> 16:16.640]  and stoned or I don't know.
[16:16.640 --> 16:19.080]  That we're like bad people and it's just nonsense.
[16:19.080 --> 16:20.720]  Like we're people just like everybody else.
[16:20.720 --> 16:22.520]  It's just we like cannabis too.
[16:22.520 --> 16:25.880]  One thing I've noticed being around potheads a lot
[16:25.880 --> 16:29.140]  for the past 20 years is a lot of them have OCD.
[16:30.280 --> 16:32.200]  Especially, and I may sound sexist,
[16:33.040 --> 16:33.880]  but this is just what I've observed.
[16:33.880 --> 16:37.120]  A lot of women get gotta clean some shit OCD.
[16:37.120 --> 16:38.320]  They get stoned and they're like,
[16:38.320 --> 16:40.000]  oh those dishes are dirty, fuck all that.
[16:40.000 --> 16:41.160]  And they just go clean the dishes.
[16:41.160 --> 16:43.040]  And it's not, it's just because in their mind,
[16:43.040 --> 16:44.480]  they're like those dishes can't be dirty.
[16:44.480 --> 16:45.800]  It's driving me crazy.
[16:45.800 --> 16:47.240]  So they do the damn dishes.
[16:47.240 --> 16:49.080]  And potheads get the same OCD.
[16:49.080 --> 16:50.360]  Like there's trash everywhere.
[16:50.360 --> 16:52.880]  I gotta pick it up, make my environment look good.
[16:52.880 --> 16:54.600]  It's just easier and more comfortable.
[16:54.600 --> 16:56.360]  I was a Boy Scout back in the day.
[16:56.360 --> 16:58.620]  Like it was important to the people around me
[16:58.620 --> 17:00.280]  that like when we went camping,
[17:00.800 --> 17:04.240]  not only did we do zero impact camping,
[17:04.240 --> 17:06.280]  so like, or leave no trace camping,
[17:06.280 --> 17:08.320]  but like we'd actively pay attention
[17:08.320 --> 17:10.560]  and grab other trash while we were out there.
[17:10.560 --> 17:12.800]  Like we always had one pocket full of other people's
[17:12.800 --> 17:15.500]  bullshit, like on the way back to camp at night,
[17:15.500 --> 17:17.600]  just so that next time we were up there,
[17:17.600 --> 17:20.120]  it was a little better than it was this time.
[17:20.120 --> 17:22.960]  And like I do it at my house too.
[17:22.960 --> 17:25.200]  Like when it's been crazy windy down here.
[17:25.200 --> 17:26.400]  So every night when I get home,
[17:26.400 --> 17:28.960]  I spend like two minutes picking up other people's trash
[17:28.960 --> 17:29.920]  out of my front yard.
[17:30.560 --> 17:31.400]  Yeah, we should put up a net.
[17:31.400 --> 17:32.800]  We really should.
[17:32.800 --> 17:33.920]  The past few days we've needed it.
[17:33.920 --> 17:35.840]  A trash net would be really helpful.
[17:35.840 --> 17:37.680]  I wanna give a shout out to Four Pieces.
[17:37.680 --> 17:40.000]  Make sure you follow at Four Pieces on Instagram.
[17:40.000 --> 17:41.360]  I'm not sure their website and stuff,
[17:41.360 --> 17:42.640]  but if you check them out on Instagram,
[17:42.640 --> 17:45.880]  Four Pieces is an organization that encourages you
[17:45.880 --> 17:48.240]  to pick up four pieces of trash per day.
[17:48.240 --> 17:49.600]  Doesn't matter where you find them,
[17:49.600 --> 17:50.440]  but it kind of does.
[17:50.440 --> 17:51.640]  You don't wanna go take them out of the dumpster
[17:51.640 --> 17:53.240]  or some shit, but I mean, do your part.
[17:53.240 --> 17:54.680]  Pick up four pieces of trash per day,
[17:54.680 --> 17:56.580]  take a picture of it, post it up on Four Pieces,
[17:56.580 --> 17:59.360]  encourage other people to pick up four pieces of trash.
[17:59.640 --> 18:02.880]  I'm continuously blown away by shit I see out in the public.
[18:02.880 --> 18:06.240]  Like what's a Starbucks cup doing in my parking lot?
[18:06.240 --> 18:08.240]  Like it wasn't there 20 minutes ago.
[18:08.240 --> 18:10.920]  I go on hikes and I find the weirdest shit on hikes
[18:10.920 --> 18:14.000]  and I'll be far from like the car or whatever,
[18:14.000 --> 18:16.040]  where I can't, wherever there is, I'm far from it.
[18:16.040 --> 18:18.440]  I'm like, how did people bring a fucking pie
[18:18.440 --> 18:19.460]  and some forks out here?
[18:19.460 --> 18:20.840]  Like what were these people doing?
[18:20.840 --> 18:23.240]  And why couldn't they just take their pie container back?
[18:23.240 --> 18:24.080]  Right.
[18:24.080 --> 18:25.720]  Pie container and a bunch of plastic forks.
[18:25.720 --> 18:27.440]  And I found a stop sign out in the middle of nowhere
[18:27.440 --> 18:28.280]  one time.
[18:28.320 --> 18:29.600]  Just cleaning all shit up.
[18:29.600 --> 18:30.640]  People are weird.
[18:30.640 --> 18:32.760]  All right, we are way off on attention here.
[18:32.760 --> 18:35.560]  I don't even know how we ended up in this place.
[18:35.560 --> 18:36.400]  But.
[18:36.400 --> 18:38.200]  No, the news article, picking up trash for joints.
[18:38.200 --> 18:39.120]  It's a great idea.
[18:39.120 --> 18:43.280]  I just, yeah, think it all the way through, please.
[18:43.280 --> 18:46.120]  Yeah, let's not give out the joints in the park next time.
[18:46.120 --> 18:47.600]  That looked a little weird on the news there.
[18:47.600 --> 18:49.880]  Right, that's the one thing that everybody
[18:49.880 --> 18:52.040]  sort of has against the consumption clubs
[18:52.040 --> 18:54.680]  is that some of them have found a way
[18:54.680 --> 18:58.880]  to do some sort of distribution.
[18:58.880 --> 19:01.240]  And we're giving joints away in the park
[19:01.240 --> 19:03.240]  for bringing us bags of trash.
[19:03.240 --> 19:04.720]  Like, that's an awesome program.
[19:04.720 --> 19:06.160]  Dude, getting people to clean up trash.
[19:06.160 --> 19:07.120]  I don't care how you do it.
[19:07.120 --> 19:07.960]  Promise for joy.
[19:07.960 --> 19:09.880]  I'm gonna jump in and interrupt you
[19:09.880 --> 19:11.840]  and do my part for the consumption clubs.
[19:11.840 --> 19:14.320]  I'm going to avoid the word distribution.
[19:14.320 --> 19:15.400]  Sorry.
[19:15.400 --> 19:18.200]  We would much rather hear the word reimbursement.
[19:18.200 --> 19:20.440]  Well, and I'm just educating you and our listeners
[19:20.440 --> 19:22.640]  so that when you, if you guys come to a consumption club,
[19:22.640 --> 19:25.120]  don't say purchase, don't say buy.
[19:25.120 --> 19:27.480]  Say, may I reimburse you for some of that
[19:27.480 --> 19:29.160]  fine quality product there?
[19:29.160 --> 19:31.920]  Like, reimbursement is the key word in these places.
[19:31.920 --> 19:34.440]  And this is why it's important all you fuckers vote.
[19:34.440 --> 19:35.720]  I'm sick of word games.
[19:35.720 --> 19:38.160]  You just call them all fuckers.
[19:38.160 --> 19:40.000]  We're just talking about head shops.
[19:40.000 --> 19:40.840]  I'm sorry, guys.
[19:40.840 --> 19:41.720]  We didn't mean it.
[19:41.720 --> 19:43.880]  Yeah, we're just talking about how some head shops
[19:43.880 --> 19:46.400]  in Colorado are still playing the water pipe game
[19:47.840 --> 19:49.000]  because they have to.
[19:50.160 --> 19:51.320]  And it's just nonsense.
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.160]  And it's because enough of our generation
[19:53.160 --> 19:54.480]  isn't voting regularly yet.
[19:54.480 --> 19:55.360]  The water pipe game.
[19:55.360 --> 19:56.720]  I want to define the water pipe game
[19:56.720 --> 19:57.760]  because some people might not.
[19:57.760 --> 19:59.600]  Oh, when you come into my marijuana store,
[19:59.600 --> 20:01.960]  I'm happy to show you the bongs on my shelf
[20:01.960 --> 20:03.960]  and tell you how much my bongs cost.
[20:03.960 --> 20:07.080]  But if the head shop up the road
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.680]  shows you the exact same thing,
[20:08.680 --> 20:10.000]  they're not allowed to call it a bong
[20:10.000 --> 20:12.440]  because if it's a bong, it might be used for marijuana.
[20:12.440 --> 20:13.760]  And if it's used for marijuana,
[20:13.760 --> 20:16.800]  it's not really legal, legal to sell.
[20:16.800 --> 20:19.320]  It's still against federal law
[20:19.320 --> 20:20.920]  because you called it a bong.
[20:22.000 --> 20:23.040]  It's 2016.
[20:23.040 --> 20:25.600]  We should be able to say, can I check out that bong?
[20:25.600 --> 20:27.520]  It really, really is 2016.
[20:27.520 --> 20:29.360]  It's actually 2016, you should be saying.
[20:29.360 --> 20:30.840]  Can I get that rig?
[20:30.840 --> 20:32.640]  Right, I'm sick of the word games.
[20:32.640 --> 20:34.160]  It's legal in Colorado now.
[20:34.160 --> 20:37.280]  And there are still places where you have to say water pipe.
[20:38.400 --> 20:41.560]  And I'm a huge advocate for consumption clubs.
[20:41.560 --> 20:46.040]  And learning another word game makes that harder.
[20:47.600 --> 20:50.080]  Well, that segues into my next news article
[20:50.160 --> 20:52.240]  because you said consumption clubs and you're a big fan.
[20:52.240 --> 20:55.520]  But this article says, this is from the Indy,
[20:55.520 --> 20:57.440]  the Colorado Springs Independent.
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.400]  It was by Nat Stein.
[20:58.400 --> 20:59.360]  The article headline says,
[20:59.360 --> 21:01.400]  City Council Bans Cannabis Clubs
[21:01.400 --> 21:03.800]  Knowing Full Well Lawsuit Is Coming.
[21:03.800 --> 21:06.520]  And this is shocking news because just a few days ago,
[21:06.520 --> 21:08.160]  we were told they had eight years
[21:08.160 --> 21:10.720]  to get their shit together to recoup their investments.
[21:10.720 --> 21:12.080]  It was a really weird decision.
[21:12.080 --> 21:13.600]  They're too dangerous to be open,
[21:13.600 --> 21:16.080]  but they have eight years to recoup their expenses.
[21:16.080 --> 21:17.640]  Like, well, which is it?
[21:17.640 --> 21:21.320]  So the article goes a little bit like this.
[21:21.320 --> 21:22.160]  Nice trying to hide that.
[21:22.160 --> 21:23.120]  I heard that real well.
[21:23.120 --> 21:23.960]  Yeah.
[21:23.960 --> 21:27.160]  Dude, those Mountain Dew cans are fucking fierce.
[21:27.160 --> 21:29.200]  You call them fuckers and cheers bitches.
[21:29.200 --> 21:30.040]  Yep.
[21:30.040 --> 21:31.440]  You're having a great night, bro.
[21:31.440 --> 21:32.760]  Dude, I drank this whole-
[21:32.760 --> 21:33.760]  It was like one in the morning.
[21:33.760 --> 21:36.160]  I'm just glad to be getting the show recorded at all.
[21:36.160 --> 21:37.880]  Gingerade Kombucha.
[21:37.880 --> 21:41.240]  And I don't know, I might, I don't know.
[21:41.240 --> 21:42.400]  I feel strange from it.
[21:42.400 --> 21:43.240]  I'm not gonna say there's alcohol in there.
[21:43.240 --> 21:44.080]  It looks like a potion.
[21:44.080 --> 21:44.900]  Like every time you drink,
[21:44.900 --> 21:47.440]  I see random things floating in the bottom of it.
[21:48.280 --> 21:49.120]  That's Kombucha.
[21:49.120 --> 21:50.840]  I think I have a nice little Kombucha buzz going on
[21:50.840 --> 21:51.680]  to tell you the truth.
[21:51.680 --> 21:52.880]  Anyway, this article goes like this.
[21:52.880 --> 21:55.720]  A marathon session at City Hall on Tuesday
[21:55.720 --> 21:58.200]  featured city council dissenters of all stripes.
[21:58.200 --> 22:00.280]  Those who pushed back on councilor Andy Pico's
[22:00.280 --> 22:03.340]  proposed resolution opposing refugee settlement.
[22:03.340 --> 22:05.160]  Those who delivered a petition demanding repeal
[22:05.160 --> 22:07.720]  of the recently enacted Pedestrian Access Act.
[22:07.720 --> 22:10.240]  Those who bemoaned the promosed land swap deal
[22:10.240 --> 22:11.080]  with the Broadmoor.
[22:11.080 --> 22:13.320]  And finally, those pleading once again for council
[22:13.320 --> 22:15.580]  to keep the cannabis clubs unshuttered.
[22:15.580 --> 22:17.940]  None of that resolved except for the club issue,
[22:17.940 --> 22:21.020]  but not in a way most had urged.
[22:21.020 --> 22:23.820]  The clubs, which were membership-based social clubs
[22:23.820 --> 22:25.700]  that allow for adult marijuana use,
[22:25.700 --> 22:28.060]  have caused consternation for city officials
[22:28.060 --> 22:29.420]  for several years now.
[22:29.420 --> 22:30.580]  They first started springing up
[22:30.580 --> 22:32.980]  after voter approved Amendment 64.
[22:32.980 --> 22:37.980]  In 2014, excuse me, Studio A64 won a zoning violation appeal
[22:38.400 --> 22:40.300]  in which the city granted the downtown club
[22:40.300 --> 22:42.240]  a similar use determination.
[22:42.240 --> 22:45.040]  In essence, saying that cannabis clubs are like social clubs,
[22:45.040 --> 22:47.560]  so are areas zoned as such.
[22:47.560 --> 22:49.800]  And then in parentheses it says permitted in multifamily,
[22:49.800 --> 22:53.000]  residential, commercial, and industrial zone districts.
[22:53.000 --> 22:54.940]  More clubs opened up all over town,
[22:54.940 --> 22:56.520]  even after the six month moratorium
[22:56.520 --> 22:59.880]  on new marijuana business licensing began in September.
[22:59.880 --> 23:01.880]  The city couldn't stop issuing a license
[23:01.880 --> 23:04.120]  that did not exist.
[23:04.120 --> 23:06.120]  Then earlier this month, the planning commission
[23:06.120 --> 23:08.280]  recommended banning the clubs outright.
[23:08.280 --> 23:10.220]  Councilor Don Knight took the ordinance to council
[23:10.220 --> 23:13.040]  proposing the group prohibit the opening of any new clubs,
[23:13.040 --> 23:15.320]  mandate licensure for all clubs
[23:15.320 --> 23:17.360]  that operated prior to the moratorium,
[23:17.360 --> 23:19.020]  subject to all sorts of new rules,
[23:19.020 --> 23:22.080]  and force those clubs to close doors after eight years.
[23:22.080 --> 23:23.720]  This is the ordinance council gave
[23:23.720 --> 23:26.080]  a final reading on Tuesday.
[23:26.080 --> 23:29.400]  Councilor Bill Murray moved to the table
[23:29.400 --> 23:31.060]  the ordinance for six months,
[23:31.060 --> 23:33.160]  so council could work with the industry
[23:33.160 --> 23:35.600]  to develop more moderate regulations.
[23:35.600 --> 23:37.480]  In the end, council voted six to three
[23:37.480 --> 23:40.320]  in favor of adopting Knight's original proposal.
[23:40.320 --> 23:43.160]  Councilors Jill Gabler and Helen Collins
[23:43.160 --> 23:45.040]  joined Murray in voting no.
[23:45.040 --> 23:47.040]  We talk about limited government all the time,
[23:47.040 --> 23:49.780]  but limited government is not about number of employees,
[23:49.780 --> 23:51.900]  it's about limited laws, Murray said.
[23:51.900 --> 23:55.620]  We're turning democracy into a morality play.
[23:55.620 --> 23:58.720]  Gabler said she was skeptical of the public process
[23:58.720 --> 24:01.100]  behind the measure, or lack thereof.
[24:01.100 --> 24:02.840]  Collins, on her part, said she didn't think
[24:02.840 --> 24:04.840]  a ban would be constitutional.
[24:04.840 --> 24:07.300]  Knight and Councilor Keith King both argued
[24:07.300 --> 24:09.700]  that council had already exercised its right
[24:09.740 --> 24:11.420]  under amendment 64 to opt out
[24:11.420 --> 24:13.700]  of the retail side of marijuana.
[24:13.700 --> 24:15.540]  Knight cited articles from the Gazette
[24:15.540 --> 24:17.300]  and Fox News as proof.
[24:17.300 --> 24:19.100]  Those articles highlight the club's practice
[24:19.100 --> 24:20.620]  of offering marijuana to patients
[24:20.620 --> 24:21.660]  who didn't bring their own,
[24:21.660 --> 24:24.840]  sometimes in exchange for a donation or reimbursement.
[24:24.840 --> 24:27.260]  Assisting other adult in the use of marijuana
[24:27.260 --> 24:30.660]  is permissible under act 64, is what this article says.
[24:30.660 --> 24:32.100]  This article's written in two different colors,
[24:32.100 --> 24:33.860]  so I apologize for my stutter.
[24:33.860 --> 24:34.860]  It makes my eyes jump around
[24:34.860 --> 24:35.880]  when it's in two colors like that.
[24:35.880 --> 24:38.260]  Don't do that if you type some shit, that's rude.
[24:38.260 --> 24:40.540]  Club owners and goers took their opportunity
[24:40.540 --> 24:41.660]  during basic public comment
[24:41.660 --> 24:43.980]  to try and correct some misconceptions.
[24:43.980 --> 24:46.500]  Amber Rasick, owner of Studio A64,
[24:46.500 --> 24:48.220]  insisted that cannabis clubs are benign
[24:48.220 --> 24:51.080]  relative to bars that serve alcohol.
[24:51.080 --> 24:52.940]  She says, I get off at 1 a.m. in the morning,
[24:52.940 --> 24:54.700]  and every time I drive downtown,
[24:54.700 --> 24:56.860]  I see people outside the bar stumbling around,
[24:56.860 --> 24:58.940]  causing problems, getting into fights.
[24:58.940 --> 25:01.300]  We are peaceful people, she said.
[25:01.300 --> 25:03.980]  All we want is a place to be accepted as human beings.
[25:03.980 --> 25:06.180]  Smoking weed is how we choose to relax,
[25:06.180 --> 25:09.260]  and it isn't hurting one, it's our right.
[25:09.260 --> 25:11.060]  Presence Mercy, I hope I said that right,
[25:11.060 --> 25:13.080]  patron and cousin of a local club owner
[25:13.080 --> 25:14.660]  took a different tack.
[25:14.660 --> 25:16.740]  Even if you hate pot, that's fine, she said,
[25:16.740 --> 25:18.260]  but we all love money, right?
[25:18.260 --> 25:20.500]  Think about what you'd gain from these clubs.
[25:20.500 --> 25:21.380]  And that's such a good point.
[25:21.380 --> 25:24.340]  I mean, that's kind of a tasteless way to say it,
[25:24.340 --> 25:25.260]  but I mean, it's the truth.
[25:25.260 --> 25:27.220]  Think about all the money that you're gonna miss out on
[25:27.220 --> 25:28.820]  if they close all of these clubs.
[25:28.820 --> 25:29.660]  Yep.
[25:29.660 --> 25:30.500]  Tax them.
[25:30.500 --> 25:31.700]  Shutting down a bunch of businesses,
[25:31.700 --> 25:34.980]  I mean, you lose a lot more than the sales tax,
[25:34.980 --> 25:37.820]  payroll tax, property tax, business tax.
[25:37.820 --> 25:39.300]  And then all of the money that those employees
[25:39.300 --> 25:40.940]  go spend back in your community?
[25:40.940 --> 25:42.020]  I mean, and all of this is silly.
[25:42.020 --> 25:44.060]  Like, there are places in the world
[25:44.060 --> 25:46.940]  that already have these clubs zoned and regulated.
[25:46.940 --> 25:48.940]  Pueblo County happens to be one of them.
[25:50.640 --> 25:53.140]  It's just Colorado Springs isn't one,
[25:53.140 --> 25:55.540]  so they're pretending like it's impossible.
[25:55.540 --> 25:59.360]  And because they're refusing to throw rules down
[25:59.360 --> 26:00.980]  and just be like, all right, follow these,
[26:00.980 --> 26:03.180]  apply here and be done with it,
[26:03.180 --> 26:06.340]  we're gonna be doing this nonsense for the next half decade.
[26:06.340 --> 26:08.060]  They need to figure out that loophole
[26:08.060 --> 26:11.040]  of how people can reimburse the club
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.980]  for the product that they use there.
[26:12.980 --> 26:13.800]  Right.
[26:13.800 --> 26:15.780]  That is the only, that seems to be the-
[26:15.780 --> 26:19.180]  Or like the club has to have a way to survive.
[26:20.300 --> 26:21.140]  Very true.
[26:21.140 --> 26:25.180]  And right now, a lot of the rules that are in place
[26:25.180 --> 26:28.060]  are like they can't do anything other than sell
[26:28.060 --> 26:30.980]  prepackaged drinks and snacks.
[26:31.100 --> 26:33.240]  You can't even do cold sandwiches,
[26:35.380 --> 26:37.980]  let alone decent food.
[26:37.980 --> 26:39.080]  It's just nuts.
[26:40.260 --> 26:43.140]  No way to reimburse for the product.
[26:44.500 --> 26:46.540]  How do you pay your rent at that point, right?
[26:46.540 --> 26:48.380]  How do you exist as an entity?
[26:49.820 --> 26:51.380]  I mean, how far out into the middle of nowhere
[26:51.380 --> 26:52.900]  do they wanna push it?
[26:52.900 --> 26:55.780]  Eventually, it's just gonna be like cousin Earl's farm.
[26:55.780 --> 26:56.700]  Yeah, and then that's pointless.
[26:56.700 --> 26:58.740]  We just need, we like having a place
[26:58.740 --> 27:00.740]  in the congregating area.
[27:01.500 --> 27:02.340]  We don't need to be going out in the woods.
[27:02.340 --> 27:04.340]  Some dude with 50 acres and a big house
[27:04.340 --> 27:06.460]  and a barn in the middle of it's gonna slap up
[27:06.460 --> 27:07.980]  and out on the internet.
[27:07.980 --> 27:10.000]  To be honest, I've been in those situations.
[27:10.000 --> 27:11.700]  I've been out in the middle of nowhere smoking
[27:11.700 --> 27:13.060]  because we had to hide.
[27:13.060 --> 27:15.740]  I've been to gatherings in every environment
[27:15.740 --> 27:16.580]  you can imagine.
[27:16.580 --> 27:17.400]  You know what I mean?
[27:17.400 --> 27:19.900]  From some random dude's house to some hippie's house
[27:19.900 --> 27:21.420]  to some gangster's house.
[27:21.420 --> 27:23.500]  I've been in every environment smoking.
[27:23.500 --> 27:26.900]  And those social clubs are the ideal safest environment.
[27:26.900 --> 27:27.940]  Nothing's gonna go wrong.
[27:27.940 --> 27:29.420]  I'm not on somebody's turf.
[27:29.420 --> 27:30.300]  I'm in a club.
[27:30.780 --> 27:31.780]  Come on, hang out.
[27:31.780 --> 27:32.700]  You paid the entry fee.
[27:32.700 --> 27:33.940]  You showed us your ID.
[27:33.940 --> 27:34.900]  You're part of our club.
[27:34.900 --> 27:35.980]  We don't have anything against you.
[27:35.980 --> 27:38.020]  Nobody here is in a different club.
[27:38.020 --> 27:39.620]  Come hang out, let's smoke.
[27:39.620 --> 27:43.000]  There was a video that I saw years and years ago
[27:43.000 --> 27:46.220]  where they're interviewing a coffee shop owner
[27:46.220 --> 27:48.940]  in Amsterdam and that's what the consumption clubs
[27:48.940 --> 27:50.560]  in Amsterdam are called.
[27:50.560 --> 27:52.940]  And he says he's been open for like 15 years
[27:52.940 --> 27:54.740]  and he goes, there's never been a fight in here.
[27:54.740 --> 27:56.340]  He goes to the bar across the street.
[27:56.340 --> 27:57.500]  The police are there every night.
[27:57.500 --> 27:58.340]  Every night.
[27:59.180 --> 28:02.020]  And I mean it's just a different,
[28:02.020 --> 28:03.980]  it's a different type of intoxicant.
[28:03.980 --> 28:06.140]  It doesn't come with that aggressive tinge.
[28:07.820 --> 28:10.520]  I see anti-pop people linking like anytime
[28:10.520 --> 28:12.720]  there's a violent incident and marijuana gets mentioned,
[28:12.720 --> 28:16.340]  like they post it up as though it was directly caused by.
[28:16.340 --> 28:17.780]  And it's like, well then you wouldn't have had to go
[28:17.780 --> 28:19.300]  to Texas to find this story.
[28:19.300 --> 28:23.180]  Like your town sold $17 million worth of weed last year.
[28:23.180 --> 28:24.660]  Like if it was being caused,
[28:24.660 --> 28:27.300]  you could link that article from Pueblo.
[28:27.300 --> 28:31.660]  But the problems with the clubs are just,
[28:31.660 --> 28:35.220]  they annoy people that really, really hate marijuana.
[28:35.220 --> 28:36.840]  And that's the biggest problem caused
[28:36.840 --> 28:38.240]  by allowing consumption clubs
[28:38.240 --> 28:40.100]  is that you annoy the squeaky wheel.
[28:41.900 --> 28:43.300]  I'll give it a few years.
[28:43.300 --> 28:44.140]  They're old.
[28:44.140 --> 28:46.300]  There's never been a problem with the Canyon.
[28:46.300 --> 28:48.460]  There's never been any trouble there.
[28:48.460 --> 28:50.260]  All right, I'm gonna continue with this article.
[28:50.260 --> 28:52.380]  Joking that being from Denver shouldn't be held against him,
[28:52.380 --> 28:54.980]  activist attorney Rob Corey reminded counsel
[28:54.980 --> 28:57.860]  that Amendment 64, which he had a hand in drafting,
[28:57.860 --> 28:59.740]  protects the activities in question.
[28:59.740 --> 29:01.780]  In Colorado, adults have the right to associate
[29:01.780 --> 29:03.980]  with each other, consume marijuana, cultivate it,
[29:03.980 --> 29:05.860]  distribute it, and help others
[29:05.860 --> 29:07.580]  with all of those things, he said.
[29:07.580 --> 29:09.100]  That's the supreme law of the land.
[29:09.100 --> 29:10.660]  The voters have spoken.
[29:10.660 --> 29:12.380]  And just like the other constitutional rights
[29:12.380 --> 29:14.420]  which council members swore to uphold,
[29:14.420 --> 29:16.060]  the rights afforded by Amendment 20
[29:16.060 --> 29:19.460]  and Amendment 64 are non-negotiable, Corey said.
[29:19.460 --> 29:23.560]  That may be difficult for you, but that is the reality.
[29:23.560 --> 29:25.880]  Jill Gaber asked Corey how other municipalities
[29:25.880 --> 29:28.040]  in the state are dealing with cannabis clubs.
[29:28.040 --> 29:29.400]  "'Not a single one has banned them
[29:29.400 --> 29:30.960]  because they can't,' he answered.
[29:30.960 --> 29:33.520]  "'Plus a city devoid of venues for social consumption
[29:33.520 --> 29:35.500]  creates other problems,' he explained.
[29:35.500 --> 29:37.880]  "'Marijuana will be smoked by adults in groups
[29:37.880 --> 29:38.880]  no matter what you do.
[29:38.880 --> 29:41.880]  You can't prevent me from inviting 50 of my closest friends
[29:41.880 --> 29:43.520]  over to smoke pot together.
[29:43.520 --> 29:45.100]  So where are they going to go?
[29:45.100 --> 29:47.520]  Coming soon to a neighborhood near you.'"
[29:47.520 --> 29:48.360]  Yep, right?
[29:48.360 --> 29:49.200]  Yeah, if they ban the clubs,
[29:49.200 --> 29:50.600]  we'll just open the front door, bro.
[29:50.600 --> 29:52.360]  Just come on, everybody and everywhere
[29:52.360 --> 29:54.880]  and come just take some dabs in my house.
[29:54.880 --> 29:56.920]  We're going to start dabbing with some
[29:56.920 --> 29:59.040]  really interesting people, we go that route.
[29:59.040 --> 30:00.520]  Well, that's part of the beauty of the club.
[30:00.520 --> 30:03.280]  I love that because I would go to the club
[30:03.280 --> 30:04.120]  once or twice a week.
[30:04.120 --> 30:05.960]  I would make an effort to show up once a week or so.
[30:05.960 --> 30:07.720]  Honestly, it got to about once every two weeks
[30:07.720 --> 30:09.140]  during trim time because we were just busy.
[30:09.140 --> 30:11.000]  But once or twice a week, I'll pop in there
[30:11.000 --> 30:12.920]  and try to spend an hour there and say hi to people.
[30:12.920 --> 30:15.040]  And I would always meet new people.
[30:15.040 --> 30:17.600]  And sometimes I'd meet people that I wish would walk away.
[30:17.600 --> 30:19.480]  But most of the time, I would meet people
[30:19.480 --> 30:20.960]  that I'd be like, damn, I'm glad I'm friends
[30:20.960 --> 30:21.800]  with that guy now.
[30:22.320 --> 30:25.600]  That's, I like most of the people I've met
[30:25.600 --> 30:27.000]  in the community.
[30:27.000 --> 30:28.840]  And I wish I could spend more time
[30:28.840 --> 30:30.000]  with the consumption clubs.
[30:30.000 --> 30:32.560]  And I haven't felt that way about a bar in forever.
[30:33.720 --> 30:36.760]  But the gray area they exist in just annoys
[30:36.760 --> 30:38.800]  the shit out of me at this point in time.
[30:40.160 --> 30:41.120]  Absolutely.
[30:41.120 --> 30:43.760]  It's just ridiculous at this point.
[30:43.760 --> 30:45.960]  And that the more people don't see it as ridiculous
[30:45.960 --> 30:47.520]  is starting to really annoy me.
[30:48.600 --> 30:50.680]  Yeah, why can we, yeah, I've said this so many times.
[30:50.680 --> 30:51.720]  Why can we have so many bars,
[30:51.720 --> 30:53.160]  but we can't have somewhere to smoke cannabis?
[30:53.160 --> 30:54.320]  It seems unfair.
[30:54.320 --> 30:56.160]  And they voted to regulate it like cannabis.
[30:56.160 --> 30:58.360]  The retort that I always get for that is,
[30:58.360 --> 31:02.280]  well, you can enjoy one alcoholic beverage
[31:02.280 --> 31:05.040]  without getting any sort of intoxication.
[31:05.040 --> 31:09.280]  But every time you consume cannabis, it's to get high.
[31:09.280 --> 31:12.840]  And it's like, well, sort of.
[31:12.840 --> 31:15.360]  But you can also consume a small amount of cannabis
[31:15.360 --> 31:16.200]  and get no high.
[31:16.200 --> 31:17.200]  I do it all the time.
[31:17.200 --> 31:20.600]  I do it consuming large amounts of cannabis products
[31:21.520 --> 31:22.880]  and I'm consuming straight CBD stuff.
[31:22.880 --> 31:24.200]  My first couple of dabs.
[31:25.040 --> 31:25.880]  Right.
[31:25.880 --> 31:27.720]  That's just, that's medicine.
[31:27.720 --> 31:29.480]  For medical consumers like you and me,
[31:29.480 --> 31:32.080]  like one or two high THC dabs,
[31:32.080 --> 31:33.680]  there's still no intoxication.
[31:33.680 --> 31:36.360]  That's just all sort of pain kill.
[31:36.360 --> 31:38.480]  It's different for everybody.
[31:38.480 --> 31:42.240]  And to make that argument is though
[31:42.240 --> 31:45.920]  most people don't go to the bar for more than one drink
[31:45.920 --> 31:49.400]  or to feel some sort of ease, relief of stress
[31:49.440 --> 31:53.080]  or blow off some steam or get a nice buzz.
[31:54.000 --> 31:56.520]  Like I've been aware of the phrase three martini lunch
[31:56.520 --> 31:57.640]  since I was like five.
[31:59.840 --> 32:01.440]  It's just a nonsense argument,
[32:01.440 --> 32:04.480]  but I hear it day after day from elected officials,
[32:04.480 --> 32:07.960]  people in suits, people whose opinions
[32:07.960 --> 32:09.080]  being printed in the newspaper.
[32:09.080 --> 32:10.760]  And it's just nonsense.
[32:10.760 --> 32:11.600]  And it's unfair.
[32:11.600 --> 32:13.200]  How come you guys have somewhere to hang out
[32:13.200 --> 32:14.800]  and congregate and drink one drink
[32:14.800 --> 32:15.800]  and I don't have somewhere to hang out
[32:15.800 --> 32:17.640]  and congregate and take one dab.
[32:17.640 --> 32:18.480]  Right.
[32:18.480 --> 32:19.320]  It's the same damn thing.
[32:20.160 --> 32:21.880]  I'm gonna continue because there's one more paragraph.
[32:21.880 --> 32:23.600]  It says at the end of his testimony,
[32:23.600 --> 32:25.920]  Corey made a show of delivering the IC attorney,
[32:25.920 --> 32:27.600]  a draft lawsuit he intends to file
[32:27.600 --> 32:30.160]  as soon as the mayor signs the club ban ordinance
[32:30.160 --> 32:32.320]  on behalf of nine clubs and 14 individuals
[32:32.320 --> 32:34.200]  who own or operate those clubs.
[32:34.200 --> 32:36.320]  The complaint asks for the ordinance to be struck down
[32:36.320 --> 32:38.400]  for violating plaintiff's rights of association,
[32:38.400 --> 32:42.080]  freedom of speech and due process under the US constitution
[32:42.080 --> 32:43.840]  as well as their right to life, liberty
[32:43.840 --> 32:46.840]  and the pursuit of happiness, religious freedom
[32:46.840 --> 32:49.240]  and right to medical and personal use of marijuana
[32:50.080 --> 32:51.680]  under Colorado constitution.
[32:51.680 --> 32:53.360]  Councilor Dine took exception to the claim
[32:53.360 --> 32:56.160]  that council has no right to ban cannabis clubs.
[32:56.160 --> 32:58.680]  We will talk about that in court, Corey said.
[32:59.720 --> 33:01.400]  Yeah.
[33:01.400 --> 33:04.160]  So with this happened, they had four days
[33:04.160 --> 33:07.960]  to draft the new rules and have the city attorney sign them
[33:07.960 --> 33:09.120]  is what I was told.
[33:09.120 --> 33:10.640]  And that should have happened,
[33:10.640 --> 33:13.200]  I think the day for that signing would be today.
[33:13.200 --> 33:14.520]  And as soon as that was signed.
[33:14.520 --> 33:16.280]  Is this story is still developing?
[33:16.280 --> 33:17.840]  As soon as the paper was signed
[33:17.840 --> 33:19.720]  is when the lawsuit went into.
[33:19.720 --> 33:23.120]  So it's the 27th is when the paper will be signed.
[33:23.120 --> 33:24.520]  And that's when the lawsuit will kick in
[33:24.520 --> 33:26.120]  is what I think I was told.
[33:26.120 --> 33:28.680]  It'll be interesting to watch this one play out.
[33:28.680 --> 33:29.520]  It sure will.
[33:29.520 --> 33:32.160]  I don't want these clubs to get closed.
[33:32.160 --> 33:33.720]  I wanna be able to go hang out.
[33:34.760 --> 33:36.880]  And like we have rules for them down here.
[33:36.880 --> 33:38.260]  It's just none of them are open
[33:38.260 --> 33:40.040]  because essentially the rules mean
[33:40.040 --> 33:42.760]  it's gonna be a huge upfront investment.
[33:42.760 --> 33:44.720]  And the rules also mean they've got to make
[33:44.720 --> 33:49.160]  that investment back with a quarter profit a piece
[33:49.160 --> 33:52.520]  on like pre-packaged bags of chips and bottled water.
[33:52.520 --> 33:53.400]  It's insane.
[33:53.400 --> 33:55.640]  Yeah, and those buildings are expensive.
[33:55.640 --> 33:56.480]  Yep.
[33:56.480 --> 33:57.680]  That part of most parts of Colorado Springs
[33:57.680 --> 33:59.560]  right now are really expensive.
[33:59.560 --> 34:01.320]  All right, so I've got one more news article
[34:01.320 --> 34:02.580]  I wanna talk about.
[34:02.580 --> 34:04.200]  Oh, I wanna mention something.
[34:04.200 --> 34:08.160]  Everybody was reading a CBD article from Facebook.
[34:08.160 --> 34:09.080]  Everybody was sharing it.
[34:09.080 --> 34:11.280]  That article was a hoax you guys.
[34:11.280 --> 34:12.400]  It got all of us riled up.
[34:12.400 --> 34:14.160]  I was looking at it a little further.
[34:14.600 --> 34:17.240]  And that actual article was a hoax.
[34:17.240 --> 34:19.540]  99% of it's a hoax.
[34:21.360 --> 34:23.040]  It's based on a truth though.
[34:23.040 --> 34:25.560]  Like the FDA did set out warning letters
[34:25.560 --> 34:27.840]  to different CBD companies.
[34:27.840 --> 34:30.200]  But it was my understanding that a lot of them
[34:31.120 --> 34:33.040]  were the ones you and me were warning people
[34:33.040 --> 34:34.680]  about a couple of months back.
[34:34.680 --> 34:35.800]  Right.
[34:35.800 --> 34:38.440]  The Chinese nonsense companies that are like,
[34:38.440 --> 34:40.280]  two drops of this will cure your cancer.
[34:40.280 --> 34:41.240]  It's pure CBD.
[34:41.240 --> 34:42.120]  And then they test it
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.160]  and it's pure codfish oil or some shit.
[34:44.160 --> 34:45.880]  Right, well I read an article on Facebook
[34:45.880 --> 34:48.440]  that was saying that the FDA sent out a letter saying
[34:48.440 --> 34:51.200]  that all CBD products were banned
[34:51.200 --> 34:53.560]  because it was now FDA regulated.
[34:53.560 --> 34:54.400]  That was not true.
[34:54.400 --> 34:55.220]  That was a hoax.
[34:55.220 --> 34:56.880]  So if you guys saw that, don't panic.
[34:56.880 --> 34:58.400]  That shit was bullshit.
[34:58.400 --> 34:59.960]  It may come down the pipeline in the future.
[34:59.960 --> 35:01.560]  But as of this time, that was a hoax.
[35:01.560 --> 35:02.400]  That was clickbait.
[35:02.400 --> 35:03.720]  People were trying to get you to click
[35:03.720 --> 35:05.000]  and I bought the bait.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  When I read it, I was like, this isn't written well.
[35:07.000 --> 35:07.920]  It doesn't look right.
[35:07.920 --> 35:08.880]  I need to do some research.
[35:08.880 --> 35:10.000]  It wasn't true.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.600]  So in a few episodes ago,
[35:12.600 --> 35:14.760]  continuingly we've been talking about a raid
[35:14.760 --> 35:16.800]  that happened in Santa Ana, California
[35:16.800 --> 35:19.280]  when some police officers raided a dispensary
[35:19.280 --> 35:21.240]  that was open and full of customers.
[35:21.240 --> 35:24.280]  Right, if you don't know which raid we're talking about,
[35:24.280 --> 35:26.360]  hit pause real quick and Google
[35:26.360 --> 35:28.860]  Santa Ana Police Dispensary Raid.
[35:28.860 --> 35:29.700]  Yes.
[35:29.700 --> 35:31.600]  And that should bring the video right up.
[35:31.600 --> 35:34.360]  So these cops were caught on camera
[35:34.360 --> 35:35.880]  destroying this dispensary.
[35:35.880 --> 35:38.080]  They ate what I thought was edibles on camera,
[35:38.080 --> 35:39.840]  but this article covers a little bit.
[35:40.680 --> 35:41.560]  It tries to back them up a little bit on that.
[35:41.560 --> 35:42.920]  I can't say that they were eating edibles.
[35:42.920 --> 35:43.960]  I wasn't there.
[35:43.960 --> 35:45.720]  This article kind of defends them.
[35:45.720 --> 35:46.560]  The headline says,
[35:46.560 --> 35:48.480]  Santa Ana cops in notorious pot eating video
[35:48.480 --> 35:50.440]  charged with petty theft and vandalism.
[35:50.440 --> 35:52.320]  The article is by Nick Shue.
[35:52.320 --> 35:53.760]  That's how I'm going to say it.
[35:53.760 --> 35:56.120]  But if the headline calls it the pot eating video,
[35:56.120 --> 35:58.520]  we can go ahead and be solid on.
[35:58.520 --> 36:01.200]  Yeah, it looked like they were eating edibles in the video.
[36:01.200 --> 36:04.080]  I would still say those were edibles.
[36:04.080 --> 36:04.920]  It was edible something.
[36:04.920 --> 36:05.760]  Dude, they were the most fun snacks ever then.
[36:05.760 --> 36:08.360]  This article is from the OC Weekly.
[36:08.360 --> 36:09.200]  It goes like this.
[36:09.200 --> 36:10.600]  The Orange County District Attorney's Office
[36:10.600 --> 36:12.960]  has filed charges against three of the police officers
[36:12.960 --> 36:16.880]  seen in a notorious video eating pot-laced candy bars
[36:16.880 --> 36:19.760]  during a May 26th, 2015 raid
[36:19.760 --> 36:23.400]  in a Santa Ana medical marijuana dispensary
[36:23.400 --> 36:24.840]  called Sky High Holistic.
[36:24.840 --> 36:26.000]  Damn, that sentence was hard for me.
[36:26.000 --> 36:27.080]  I apologize.
[36:27.080 --> 36:29.480]  The video first posted by OC Weekly last June
[36:29.480 --> 36:31.720]  clearly showed officers passing around candy bars,
[36:31.720 --> 36:33.400]  joking about feeling lightheaded
[36:33.400 --> 36:36.160]  and tossing darts after finishing their Scooby snack.
[36:36.160 --> 36:38.600]  The shocking footage of the Sky High cops went viral,
[36:39.040 --> 36:41.880]  leading to nationwide and international news reports.
[36:41.880 --> 36:43.240]  Yet in its official announcement
[36:43.240 --> 36:45.360]  of the misdemeanor charges filed today,
[36:45.360 --> 36:48.320]  the OCDA claims there is no evidence
[36:48.320 --> 36:50.760]  that any of the Santa Ana Police Department officers
[36:50.760 --> 36:53.080]  shown in the video consumed marijuana products
[36:53.080 --> 36:54.240]  during the raid.
[36:54.240 --> 36:55.800]  Instead, they're being prosecuted
[36:55.800 --> 36:57.360]  for causing intentional damage
[36:57.360 --> 36:59.640]  to legally disabled video cameras
[36:59.640 --> 37:03.120]  and eating detour sample protein bars
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.200]  and Mr. Thinster cookies
[37:05.200 --> 37:07.360]  that were not marijuana-laced products
[37:07.360 --> 37:08.720]  on sale at the dispensary,
[37:08.720 --> 37:12.280]  but were simply snacks available to staff.
[37:12.280 --> 37:14.000]  I hate the word laced.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.320]  I hate the word laced too.
[37:15.320 --> 37:16.800]  That's dumb.
[37:16.800 --> 37:19.280]  Basically, the good news is charges were filed.
[37:19.280 --> 37:24.080]  The bad news is because the video footage is so grainy,
[37:24.080 --> 37:26.400]  they're claiming, or the cops are claiming,
[37:26.400 --> 37:30.440]  that what they were consuming were non-infused products
[37:30.440 --> 37:33.400]  that the store had on hand for staff.
[37:33.400 --> 37:36.200]  And one of their charges, if I remember correctly,
[37:36.200 --> 37:38.800]  is stealing those food items.
[37:38.800 --> 37:40.520]  That'll, yeah, we'll get, that's in the article,
[37:40.520 --> 37:41.360]  so we'll get to that.
[37:41.360 --> 37:46.280]  Yeah, but dude, just listeners, think about this.
[37:46.280 --> 37:50.520]  When's the last time you shared a candy bar with a coworker?
[37:51.760 --> 37:53.240]  Like pass that shit around.
[37:53.240 --> 37:54.080]  Like, it's a joint.
[37:54.080 --> 37:55.440]  How many times have you been at a place?
[37:55.440 --> 37:56.320]  Yeah, okay.
[37:56.320 --> 37:57.880]  I'm gonna just- Just think about that.
[37:57.880 --> 37:59.880]  The officers named in the OCDA announcement
[37:59.880 --> 38:01.360]  as facing petty theft charges
[38:01.360 --> 38:04.000]  for eating the supposedly non-pot-laced candy bars.
[38:04.000 --> 38:05.120]  Okay, I wanna stop.
[38:05.120 --> 38:06.480]  We don't say it laced.
[38:06.480 --> 38:08.000]  If you put it in there on purpose,
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.040]  and it's being sold as, like, laced is hiding it.
[38:11.040 --> 38:12.760]  Like, laced is when you put some,
[38:12.760 --> 38:13.600]  when you take a joint
[38:13.600 --> 38:15.080]  and you put some special sprinkles in there,
[38:15.080 --> 38:16.440]  and you don't tell somebody, and they smoke it,
[38:16.440 --> 38:17.480]  and like, yo, I'm fucked up.
[38:17.480 --> 38:18.920]  And you're like, yeah, it was laced, ha ha.
[38:18.920 --> 38:19.960]  That's laced.
[38:19.960 --> 38:21.320]  Infused is what we're doing here.
[38:21.320 --> 38:22.160]  We are purposely putting this product in there.
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.520]  Right, lacing only happens in crazy people's minds.
[38:25.520 --> 38:28.040]  Like, it's mostly a myth.
[38:29.040 --> 38:29.880]  Mostly.
[38:29.880 --> 38:31.600]  It's definitely not what dispensaries do
[38:31.600 --> 38:34.120]  to get their customers stoned.
[38:34.120 --> 38:36.120]  Right, lacing doesn't happen in a dispensary.
[38:36.120 --> 38:38.560]  So, non-pot-infused candy bars.
[38:38.560 --> 38:40.120]  The, let's see.
[38:40.120 --> 38:41.720]  The officer's name in the OCDA announcement
[38:41.720 --> 38:42.880]  is facing petty theft charges
[38:42.880 --> 38:45.840]  for eating the supposedly non-pot-infused candy bars.
[38:45.840 --> 38:47.980]  Are Brandon, Matthew, do we wanna read all their names?
[38:47.980 --> 38:49.960]  I don't wanna glorify them by reading their names.
[38:49.960 --> 38:53.000]  Another officer also faces an additional count of vandalism
[38:53.000 --> 38:54.920]  for damaging the disabled video cameras
[38:54.920 --> 38:57.240]  and allegedly smashing their lenses
[38:57.240 --> 39:01.160]  into the corner of a display case and cash register.
[39:01.160 --> 39:02.640]  That guy's an extra dick.
[39:02.640 --> 39:04.480]  Let's go, he gets an extra charge.
[39:04.480 --> 39:06.980]  The three defendants are accused of consuming the food items
[39:06.980 --> 39:10.340]  and sharing the protein bars with other SAPD personnel,
[39:10.340 --> 39:11.880]  the press release states,
[39:11.880 --> 39:13.140]  before leaving the premises
[39:13.140 --> 39:15.100]  at the conclusion of the search warrant.
[39:15.100 --> 39:17.160]  Two officers, I can't even say one of their names,
[39:17.160 --> 39:19.560]  are accused of taking extra cookies with them.
[39:19.560 --> 39:22.400]  The DA's office says it concluded a thorough investigation
[39:22.400 --> 39:24.200]  of the incident, including the careful review
[39:24.200 --> 39:27.960]  of more than 16 hours of unedited video surveillance footage
[39:27.960 --> 39:30.800]  with cooperation of the SAPD.
[39:30.800 --> 39:32.920]  While other SAPD personnel,
[39:32.920 --> 39:34.860]  like the bald cop seen in the video saying
[39:34.860 --> 39:37.600]  he felt lightheaded after eating one of them,
[39:37.600 --> 39:38.920]  ate some protein bars,
[39:38.920 --> 39:41.760]  there is unsignificant, insufficient evidence,
[39:41.760 --> 39:43.160]  sorry, I'm stuttering on this one.
[39:43.160 --> 39:44.440]  There is insufficient evidence
[39:44.440 --> 39:47.280]  that they knew the food items belonged to the dispensary
[39:47.280 --> 39:49.920]  and not their fellow officers, the release states.
[39:49.920 --> 39:52.560]  There was also no evidence that any SAPD personnel
[39:52.560 --> 39:54.660]  consumed any edible marijuana items
[39:54.660 --> 39:56.320]  available at the dispensary.
[39:58.000 --> 39:59.520]  And then it's,
[39:59.560 --> 40:01.600]  they expect us to believe this shit?
[40:01.600 --> 40:02.600]  Well, the article even says,
[40:02.600 --> 40:03.960]  right, no evidence whatsoever,
[40:03.960 --> 40:06.180]  other than the fact that the cops were at a pot shop
[40:06.180 --> 40:08.160]  eating candy bars and acting high.
[40:08.160 --> 40:10.960]  One is then left with the obvious conclusion
[40:10.960 --> 40:13.160]  that these poor officers are so underpaid
[40:13.160 --> 40:14.420]  that they have no choice,
[40:14.420 --> 40:17.780]  but to munch down on pilfered protein bars while on duty.
[40:17.780 --> 40:19.600]  That makes so much more sense.
[40:19.600 --> 40:20.440]  Right, like,
[40:21.820 --> 40:24.720]  they broke in, they smashed everything,
[40:24.720 --> 40:28.200]  and they were like, oh, Chaz brought cookies?
[40:28.200 --> 40:31.000]  Like, to their military style raid,
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.140]  like, you've seen the video.
[40:32.140 --> 40:34.920]  They jump out of their SWAT car and their SWAT gear,
[40:34.920 --> 40:37.800]  and they fucking bang open an unlocked fucking door
[40:37.800 --> 40:40.360]  by kicking it the wrong way a bunch.
[40:40.360 --> 40:41.720]  Screaming, yelling at everybody,
[40:41.720 --> 40:45.600]  and they're like, what, the dude in the back had cookies?
[40:45.600 --> 40:48.120]  Motherfucker, how high are you?
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.000]  Like, how little attention do they think we're paying?
[40:51.000 --> 40:52.840]  They sit there in the video and talk about
[40:52.840 --> 40:54.280]  how they're all woozy from eating
[40:54.280 --> 40:56.420]  the protein bars they stole.
[40:57.100 --> 40:58.940]  And when you see the video,
[40:58.940 --> 41:00.580]  and then you look at these charges,
[41:00.580 --> 41:01.980]  and it's like, okay, the rest of that
[41:01.980 --> 41:04.020]  was just legal, common procedure?
[41:04.020 --> 41:06.340]  Like, how is that common?
[41:06.340 --> 41:08.360]  Well, it also says, if convicted on all counts,
[41:08.360 --> 41:10.940]  the trio of uninformed snack fiends faces
[41:10.940 --> 41:14.520]  between six months and one year in jail, plus fines.
[41:14.520 --> 41:17.380]  So if they do get, if they do go to court,
[41:17.380 --> 41:18.920]  they do get a jury,
[41:18.920 --> 41:21.160]  the jury's gonna watch this video and convict them,
[41:21.160 --> 41:22.760]  if they get real people on the jury,
[41:22.760 --> 41:25.560]  if they don't fucking fix that jury up real nice.
[41:25.720 --> 41:29.200]  Yeah, I kinda wanna see what happens
[41:29.200 --> 41:31.480]  to these guys if they go to jail.
[41:31.480 --> 41:32.320]  Nothing good.
[41:32.320 --> 41:34.120]  Cops don't do well in jail.
[41:34.120 --> 41:35.660]  I haven't been there, I don't know,
[41:35.660 --> 41:37.840]  but I've seen plenty of movies to know
[41:37.840 --> 41:39.960]  that cops are not gonna do well in jail.
[41:39.960 --> 41:41.600]  The behavior's so egregious,
[41:41.600 --> 41:43.880]  and we've seen it for so long in this community.
[41:43.880 --> 41:47.840]  There's a raid for a dispensary or whatnot,
[41:47.840 --> 41:50.120]  and they come back the day after the raid
[41:50.120 --> 41:54.240]  with video cameras, and everything's broken.
[41:54.240 --> 41:56.920]  Like everything, everything, the walls, the lights,
[41:56.920 --> 42:00.760]  the light bulbs, the doorknobs, everything's destroyed.
[42:00.760 --> 42:04.440]  The carpet's ripped up, electrical wiring's destroyed.
[42:05.400 --> 42:08.400]  And it's like, well, you were serving a search warrant.
[42:08.400 --> 42:10.160]  It's just a display of aggression.
[42:10.160 --> 42:12.440]  You just came in, destroyed everything in Bast,
[42:12.440 --> 42:14.960]  you didn't even arrest anybody, no charges were filed,
[42:14.960 --> 42:17.320]  you just came in, took everything, destroyed everything
[42:17.320 --> 42:19.680]  that isn't worth taking and left.
[42:19.680 --> 42:23.120]  Like, that's not law enforcement, that's piracy.
[42:24.040 --> 42:25.000]  That's terrorism.
[42:25.000 --> 42:26.380]  Yeah, it's insane.
[42:27.360 --> 42:30.280]  And most of the public's cool with it
[42:30.280 --> 42:32.280]  because they're doing it to the stoners.
[42:33.280 --> 42:35.760]  The stoners that worked hard to open a business
[42:35.760 --> 42:37.760]  and try to help and contribute.
[42:37.760 --> 42:40.280]  Thank God there hasn't been a lot of these raids
[42:40.280 --> 42:44.260]  in Colorado, but I see them regularly in other states
[42:44.260 --> 42:49.260]  where a business has invested years, millions of dollars
[42:49.900 --> 42:53.940]  to get up, running, start getting successful.
[42:53.940 --> 42:56.380]  And then the cops come in, destroy everything,
[42:56.380 --> 42:58.020]  take everything worth money in Bounce,
[42:58.020 --> 43:01.820]  and a year later, no one's been charged with anything.
[43:01.820 --> 43:03.900]  And the store is back up and running again.
[43:03.900 --> 43:06.140]  I mean, from my perspective,
[43:06.140 --> 43:07.820]  that's why they don't want us to use banks
[43:07.820 --> 43:10.620]  because there's more paperwork to seize a bank account
[43:10.620 --> 43:12.360]  than to just snatch the safes.
[43:13.260 --> 43:14.540]  I hadn't thought about it that way.
[43:14.540 --> 43:16.700]  That sucks, but yeah, that sounds accurate.
[43:16.700 --> 43:18.380]  There's more cash in there, they can just come get it
[43:18.420 --> 43:20.580]  and buy themselves more armored vehicles and Humvees.
[43:20.580 --> 43:22.940]  Right, these aren't necessarily the opinions of the podcast.
[43:22.940 --> 43:24.700]  These are the opinions of Wyatt Mike himself.
[43:24.700 --> 43:25.540]  I agree with you.
[43:25.540 --> 43:26.860]  I might support your statements, my friend.
[43:26.860 --> 43:28.220]  That's why I bring you on the show.
[43:28.220 --> 43:33.060]  Like that's why I don't mind waiting for hours in line
[43:33.060 --> 43:36.140]  to vote is because I started paying attention
[43:36.140 --> 43:38.100]  and the more I paid attention, the more it caught my
[43:38.100 --> 43:41.400]  attention and the more I saw, the more pissed I got.
[43:43.980 --> 43:45.060]  All right.
[43:45.060 --> 43:47.100]  Start reading the news in your area, folks.
[43:47.100 --> 43:48.420]  Mike, you should just do mic drops.
[43:48.420 --> 43:49.980]  You should just take that mic right out of the stand
[43:49.980 --> 43:51.140]  to start dropping it occasionally.
[43:51.140 --> 43:52.380]  We've had enough gear problems
[43:52.380 --> 43:54.780]  without me breaking the microphone.
[43:54.780 --> 43:56.060]  All right, so speaking of gear problems,
[43:56.060 --> 43:57.060]  let me see how long we've been going.
[43:57.060 --> 43:58.780]  I'm guessing about 33 minutes.
[43:58.780 --> 44:00.180]  I haven't looked.
[44:00.180 --> 44:01.620]  We are at 44 minutes.
[44:01.620 --> 44:02.780]  Shout out to my friend 44.
[44:02.780 --> 44:04.260]  44 and two is your new name, buddy.
[44:04.260 --> 44:05.740]  I don't know if you listen to the podcast lately,
[44:05.740 --> 44:09.220]  but you've earned the new name of 44 and two.
[44:09.220 --> 44:10.820]  Number one was that ticket
[44:10.820 --> 44:12.660]  and number two was your recent adventure.
[44:12.660 --> 44:14.820]  So 44 and two is your new name, tough guy.
[44:15.340 --> 44:17.820]  Yeah, that's all the podcast we got for you today.
[44:17.820 --> 44:19.180]  Mike, thanks for coming and hanging out.
[44:19.180 --> 44:20.660]  Sorry I had to make it a late night for you.
[44:20.660 --> 44:21.900]  Happy to, my man.
[44:21.900 --> 44:24.020]  Late nights to get these shows in
[44:24.020 --> 44:25.460]  are the name of the game right now.
[44:25.460 --> 44:26.300]  Yes, it is.
[44:26.300 --> 44:28.380]  You got the kit, I got the job, you got the job.
[44:28.380 --> 44:29.700]  Hope you guys enjoy it,
[44:29.700 --> 44:33.540]  because we work pretty hard to bring a good one to you.
[44:34.640 --> 44:35.600]  Yes, we do.
[44:35.600 --> 44:36.580]  We do, that's the truth.
[44:36.580 --> 44:38.220]  I was going to try to come up with some smart ass to say,
[44:38.220 --> 44:39.620]  but I didn't have shit for you.
[44:39.620 --> 44:40.460]  Right.
[44:40.460 --> 44:43.140]  Too many dabs to be a smart ass at this point in time.
[44:43.140 --> 44:44.180]  I want to thank everybody for listening
[44:44.540 --> 44:45.380]  to the podcast.
[44:45.380 --> 44:46.300]  I don't have a lot to say here at the end of the show.
[44:46.300 --> 44:47.540]  I don't have any sponsors.
[44:47.540 --> 44:49.540]  Make sure you check out the secret sesh.
[44:51.260 --> 44:52.100]  Yep, that's it.
[44:52.100 --> 44:53.020]  Big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[44:53.020 --> 44:53.860]  And until next time,
[44:53.860 --> 44:56.180]  take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[44:56.180 --> 45:09.300]  Oh, yes.
[45:11.300 --> 45:14.220]  Oh, I met a girl this morning.
[45:14.220 --> 45:17.460]  She was love at first sight.
[45:17.460 --> 45:20.660]  Oh, I met a girl this morning.
[45:20.660 --> 45:23.980]  And she was beauty to my eyes.
[45:23.980 --> 45:25.140]  I asked her where she from.
[45:25.140 --> 45:27.140]  She tell me in the topics.
[45:27.140 --> 45:28.460]  She asked me what's my name.
[45:28.460 --> 45:30.460]  I tell her I am Tony.
[45:30.460 --> 45:33.260]  And I said, girl, tell me what's your name.
[45:33.380 --> 45:35.660]  Tell me that her name is Jamaica.
[45:35.660 --> 45:39.980]  And I said, smile, girl, smile.
[45:39.980 --> 45:42.140]  Smile for me, Jamaica.
[45:42.140 --> 45:45.540]  And I said, smile, girl, smile.
[45:45.540 --> 45:48.620]  Oh, Lord, smile for me, Jamaica.
[45:48.620 --> 45:52.300]  And never you cry, here am I.
[45:52.300 --> 45:55.260]  Yeah, I'm here for you, Jamaica.
[45:55.260 --> 45:58.940]  Dry your eyes, girl, smile.
[45:58.940 --> 46:01.620]  Uh-huh, smile for me, Jamaica.
[46:01.620 --> 46:03.620]  Oh, Lord.
[46:03.620 --> 46:05.740]  She have a richest trip.
[46:05.740 --> 46:08.740]  A beautiful woman with the sweetest gifts.
[46:08.740 --> 46:12.020]  Beautiful sunrise and an evening kiss.
[46:12.020 --> 46:15.940]  Off a nice sunset on the evening seas, yeah.
[46:15.940 --> 46:18.460]  But she tell me say she tired.
[46:18.460 --> 46:21.500]  Tired of the exploits and the liars.
[46:21.500 --> 46:23.380]  She give them reggae, give them beaches,
[46:23.380 --> 46:25.060]  give them flowers and the ferns.
[46:25.060 --> 46:27.620]  All she got is abuse in return.
[46:27.620 --> 46:31.460]  But I say, don't you worry yourself, mama.
[46:31.900 --> 46:34.500]  Chronic disease here to your help, mama.
[46:34.500 --> 46:37.980]  Ooh, I said, don't worry yourself, mama.
[46:37.980 --> 46:40.860]  One thing we a beg you do for me.
[46:40.860 --> 46:44.780]  And I say, smile, girl, smile.
[46:44.780 --> 46:46.940]  Smile for me, Jamaica.
[46:46.940 --> 46:50.700]  And I said, smile, girl, smile.
[46:50.700 --> 46:53.540]  Hey, smile for me, Jamaica.
[46:53.540 --> 46:57.180]  Never you cry, here am I.
[46:57.180 --> 46:59.820]  Girl, I'm here for you, Jamaica.
[46:59.940 --> 47:01.780]  What must I try?
[47:01.780 --> 47:03.980]  Oh, man.
[47:03.980 --> 47:07.220]  All that she ask me, and this is what I say.
[47:07.220 --> 47:10.540]  A sweet, sweet chronic self, you give them, give them.
[47:10.540 --> 47:13.740]  The one drop beat for not breathing with them.
[47:13.740 --> 47:17.020]  And you give them bop with a different stepping.
[47:17.020 --> 47:20.220]  And you give them bolt, nobody can run left him.
[47:20.220 --> 47:23.100]  Boy, but see, yeah.
[47:23.100 --> 47:26.300]  They must see things, say you're out of ideas.
[47:26.300 --> 47:29.740]  You give them heart and sweet literature.
[47:30.140 --> 47:33.140]  You're gonna make the world see the better picture.
[47:33.140 --> 47:36.740]  Ooh, I said, don't worry yourself, mama.
[47:36.740 --> 47:39.540]  Chronic disease here to your help, mama.
[47:39.540 --> 47:42.860]  Ooh, I said, don't worry yourself, mama.
[47:42.860 --> 47:45.620]  One thing we a beg you do for me.
[47:45.620 --> 47:49.780]  And I said, smile, girl, smile.
[47:49.780 --> 47:52.020]  Smile for me, Jamaica.
[47:52.020 --> 47:55.340]  And I said, smile, girl, smile.
[47:55.340 --> 47:56.740]  Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.
[47:56.740 --> 47:58.500]  Smile for me, Jamaica.
[47:58.500 --> 48:03.300]  Whenever you cry, you're on my world.
[48:03.300 --> 48:04.900]  For me, Jamaica.
[48:04.900 --> 48:08.500]  And I said, smile, boy.
[48:08.500 --> 48:11.860]  You can give me more, more.
