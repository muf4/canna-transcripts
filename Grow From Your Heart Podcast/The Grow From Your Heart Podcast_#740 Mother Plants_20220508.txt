[00:06.160 --> 00:08.120]  now's a good time to click subscribe.
[00:32.720 --> 00:34.600]  Happy Mother's Day, Podcast World.
[00:34.600 --> 00:37.040]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:37.040 --> 00:41.880]  This is episode 740 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:41.880 --> 00:45.040]  In this episode, we're going to focus on mother plants.
[00:45.040 --> 00:46.720]  Before I get to that part of the show,
[00:46.720 --> 00:49.320]  let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks
[00:49.320 --> 00:52.720]  who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:52.720 --> 00:55.320]  Let's kick it off with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:55.320 --> 00:57.080]  Thank you, shout out to the captain
[00:57.080 --> 00:58.920]  and commander of the Irie Army.
[00:58.920 --> 01:01.440]  Let's send a big salute to my buddy, Lemur Priest.

[01:11.760 --> 01:12.960]  Let's send a big thank you shout out
[01:12.960 --> 01:14.720]  to my dude, Tree Star Meadow.
[01:14.720 --> 01:16.560]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out
[01:16.560 --> 01:19.600]  to one of my favorite photographers, my buddy, Zoso J.
[01:19.600 --> 01:22.240]  Let's send a thank you shout out to my dude, Alabama Man.
[01:22.240 --> 01:24.640]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Danky Dave.
[01:24.640 --> 01:26.440]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out
[01:26.440 --> 01:28.040]  to my dude, Tonto's Garden.
[01:28.040 --> 01:29.960]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out
[01:29.960 --> 01:31.480]  to Bong Stain Bear.
[01:31.480 --> 01:32.920]  I want to send a special thank you shout out
[01:32.920 --> 01:35.520]  to a long time supporter, my good friend, Miss Mel.
[01:35.520 --> 01:37.920]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Crazy Hand Grows.
[01:37.920 --> 01:38.960]  Then let's wrap it all up
[01:38.960 --> 01:40.920]  with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:40.920 --> 01:44.520]  Thank you shout out to Groove2112.
[01:44.560 --> 01:47.240]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody
[01:47.240 --> 01:49.800]  who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:51.920 --> 01:53.800]  and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:53.800 --> 01:58.320]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com
[01:58.320 --> 02:00.160]  forward slash growfromyourheart.
[02:00.160 --> 02:01.720]  All of the information you need
[02:01.720 --> 02:03.200]  will be right there on the screen.
[02:03.200 --> 02:05.560]  And of course I do include a link in the show notes
[02:05.560 --> 02:07.480]  and in the video description.
[02:08.560 --> 02:10.080]  Excuse me for the throat clearing right here
[02:10.080 --> 02:11.200]  at the start of the show.
[02:11.200 --> 02:13.400]  I've been taking some monstrous dabs
[02:13.400 --> 02:16.280]  of some machine live batter from a friend.
[02:16.280 --> 02:17.360]  They don't want to be mentioned.
[02:17.360 --> 02:19.060]  Fist bump, you know who you are.
[02:19.060 --> 02:20.760]  Great work, it does mess up the throat,
[02:20.760 --> 02:22.160]  but it puts me in the greatest mood,
[02:22.160 --> 02:24.240]  the greatest zone for podcasting.
[02:24.240 --> 02:26.400]  That machine puts on these blinders.
[02:26.400 --> 02:28.640]  All I could really pay attention to is that camera,
[02:28.640 --> 02:30.860]  these lights kind of went away, the notes are right here.
[02:30.860 --> 02:34.040]  Really digging the vibe of the machine live batter
[02:34.040 --> 02:36.000]  other than the clogged up throat.
[02:36.000 --> 02:37.480]  Pretty phenomenal concentrates.
[02:37.480 --> 02:39.320]  Excuse me for doing that rudely into the microphone.
[02:39.320 --> 02:41.040]  That was uncalled for.
[02:41.040 --> 02:43.220]  Big shout out to all of the friends who support the show.
[02:44.040 --> 02:44.880]  Happy Mother's Day.
[02:44.880 --> 02:45.820]  Let's quit rambling and focus in.
[02:45.820 --> 02:47.060]  Let's do a podcast.
[02:47.060 --> 02:50.220]  All right, let's do a deep dive into mother plants.
[02:50.220 --> 02:52.020]  Mother plants are a very important aspect
[02:52.020 --> 02:53.940]  of cannabis cultivation.
[02:53.940 --> 02:56.100]  Let's talk about what a mother plant is.
[02:56.100 --> 02:58.620]  Then we'll talk about how to establish a mother plant.
[02:58.620 --> 03:01.380]  Then we'll talk a little more deeply into mother plants.
[03:01.380 --> 03:04.000]  Let's get started by talking about what a mother plant is.
[03:04.000 --> 03:05.020]  What am I talking about?
[03:05.020 --> 03:07.240]  Mother plant, what does that even mean?
[03:07.240 --> 03:08.580]  When we cultivate cannabis,
[03:08.580 --> 03:10.740]  oftentimes we will find a plant
[03:10.740 --> 03:12.320]  that we kind of fall in love with.
[03:12.320 --> 03:13.600]  Something you wanna keep smoking
[03:13.600 --> 03:14.880]  over and over and over again.
[03:14.880 --> 03:16.440]  You wanna keep growing it.
[03:16.440 --> 03:17.760]  As a breeder, as a grower,
[03:17.760 --> 03:19.680]  I like to grow something multiple times.
[03:19.680 --> 03:20.800]  I like to grow it,
[03:20.800 --> 03:22.780]  the first time I grow it, I call it the first date.
[03:22.780 --> 03:25.400]  I'm just gonna give it the standard operating procedure,
[03:25.400 --> 03:27.600]  the basic nutrients, the basic grow room.
[03:27.600 --> 03:30.000]  We'll see how that plant reacts to the room.
[03:30.000 --> 03:31.360]  The second time, I'll say,
[03:31.360 --> 03:33.040]  well, last time it didn't react to the cool.
[03:33.040 --> 03:34.180]  It didn't react well to the hot.
[03:34.180 --> 03:35.300]  It didn't like these nutrients.
[03:35.300 --> 03:36.800]  It could have done better with this.
[03:36.800 --> 03:38.400]  I will give it those things.
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.380]  Every time I grow that plant, I'll take notes.
[03:40.380 --> 03:41.480]  I'll pay attention.
[03:41.480 --> 03:43.320]  I will observe, I will sample,
[03:43.320 --> 03:45.120]  and I will make adjustments every grow.
[03:45.120 --> 03:47.200]  And by the third, fifth, sixth grow,
[03:47.200 --> 03:48.440]  that plant will be banging.
[03:48.440 --> 03:49.520]  It'll be doing much better
[03:49.520 --> 03:50.720]  than the first time that I grew it
[03:50.720 --> 03:53.460]  because I've developed a relationship with that plant.
[03:53.460 --> 03:55.600]  Now, how do I continue to grow that plant?
[03:55.600 --> 03:57.960]  I need to keep a mother plant of that plant.
[03:57.960 --> 04:00.000]  Let's just get into, so we know what a mother plant is.
[04:00.000 --> 04:01.280]  That mother plant in the future
[04:01.280 --> 04:04.880]  is going to be designated to give us clones
[04:04.880 --> 04:06.800]  to keep our genetics alive in the future.
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.320]  It's a mother plant that stays in the room, unflowered,
[04:09.320 --> 04:10.720]  and we can take cuttings from that
[04:10.760 --> 04:12.400]  and turn them into clones or clippings
[04:12.400 --> 04:14.280]  or reproductions of our original plant.
[04:14.280 --> 04:17.800]  And we can continually grow this plant over and over again.
[04:17.800 --> 04:19.400]  This one never goes into flower.
[04:19.400 --> 04:20.280]  We save it.
[04:20.280 --> 04:21.720]  It's like our little genetic preserve.
[04:21.720 --> 04:22.740]  So that is a mother plant.
[04:22.740 --> 04:24.340]  How do we get to a mother plant?
[04:24.340 --> 04:26.040]  That's a very good question.
[04:26.040 --> 04:28.560]  Let's say we are either given a pack of seeds
[04:28.560 --> 04:29.720]  or we are given a clone
[04:29.720 --> 04:32.080]  or we acquire a clone or a pack of seeds.
[04:32.080 --> 04:33.480]  So let's start with a pack of seeds.
[04:33.480 --> 04:35.720]  Let's say we are given a 10 pack of seeds.
[04:35.720 --> 04:37.440]  You just are gifted a pack of seeds.
[04:37.440 --> 04:38.280]  That was super nice.
[04:38.280 --> 04:39.320]  I was like, hey bro, want some seeds?
[04:39.320 --> 04:40.200]  You're like, I sure do.
[04:40.680 --> 04:41.880]  Or whoever, whatever I called you.
[04:41.880 --> 04:44.280]  And I gave you a 10 pack of seeds and you grew them.
[04:44.280 --> 04:46.600]  Now you're going to find an amazing plant
[04:46.600 --> 04:47.600]  out of that 10 pack.
[04:47.600 --> 04:49.280]  You'll find one that really stands out to you.
[04:49.280 --> 04:51.000]  We will do what is a pheno hunt.
[04:51.000 --> 04:52.540]  We will grow all of these seeds.
[04:52.540 --> 04:54.220]  We will carefully observe them.
[04:54.220 --> 04:55.080]  Watch how they grow.
[04:55.080 --> 04:56.500]  There's gonna be a couple of plants in there
[04:56.500 --> 04:57.480]  that really stand out.
[04:57.480 --> 04:59.800]  One's gonna not even be desirable to you,
[04:59.800 --> 05:01.260]  but maybe to somebody else.
[05:01.260 --> 05:02.680]  One's gonna really stand out to you.
[05:02.680 --> 05:04.160]  One's gonna be pretty good.
[05:04.160 --> 05:05.320]  You're probably gonna get one
[05:05.320 --> 05:06.640]  that puts out a lot of weight,
[05:06.640 --> 05:07.940]  one that really tastes good,
[05:07.940 --> 05:09.960]  and then one of those will be super potent.
[05:10.720 --> 05:11.560]  There's always two that it's hard to decide
[05:11.560 --> 05:13.800]  between which keepers you want to keep.
[05:13.800 --> 05:15.940]  Let's talk about keeping one of those as a mother plant.
[05:15.940 --> 05:18.800]  What I would do, I would grow those seeds
[05:18.800 --> 05:20.720]  until they are big enough to get a clone.
[05:20.720 --> 05:22.320]  We talked about cloning earlier.
[05:22.320 --> 05:24.600]  I would take three clones from each seedling.
[05:24.600 --> 05:27.980]  Now I've got three opportunities to keep these plants alive.
[05:27.980 --> 05:29.240]  I would grow them out.
[05:29.240 --> 05:30.520]  I would either, at this point,
[05:30.520 --> 05:33.320]  what I would do as soon as my clones show roots,
[05:33.320 --> 05:35.340]  I would flower these plants that have been growing.
[05:35.340 --> 05:36.420]  They're already established.
[05:36.420 --> 05:37.720]  They're already pretty big.
[05:37.720 --> 05:40.000]  Let's just flower those out, see what we've got.
[05:40.000 --> 05:41.400]  We'll pull the males immediately.
[05:41.400 --> 05:43.760]  Once these plants I put in flower show male,
[05:43.760 --> 05:45.660]  I will also call that male clone
[05:45.660 --> 05:47.040]  if I'm not looking for a male.
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.180]  In this pheno hunt, we're just looking
[05:49.180 --> 05:50.720]  for a mom to make a mother plant,
[05:50.720 --> 05:52.600]  for a good keeper to make a mother plant.
[05:52.600 --> 05:54.720]  So we're gonna grow all of these seedlings.
[05:54.720 --> 05:55.860]  We're going to cut a clone.
[05:55.860 --> 05:59.760]  We're gonna put the mom, the original plant, into flower.
[05:59.760 --> 06:02.220]  When those show us sex, we will call all of the boys,
[06:02.220 --> 06:04.220]  the small boys and the big boys.
[06:04.220 --> 06:06.500]  Now we are only down to the females.
[06:06.500 --> 06:07.420]  One thing I should mention,
[06:07.420 --> 06:09.580]  carefully label all of your plants.
[06:09.580 --> 06:11.980]  The way I do it is either alphabetically or numerically.
[06:11.980 --> 06:13.780]  I've just got plants A through Z,
[06:13.780 --> 06:15.740]  or we're in Colorado, A through six,
[06:15.740 --> 06:18.020]  whatever number six is in the alphabet,
[06:18.020 --> 06:20.220]  or 12, depending on where we are.
[06:20.220 --> 06:22.460]  I number them, one through six, one through 12.
[06:22.460 --> 06:23.460]  Then when I take clones,
[06:23.460 --> 06:25.540]  the clones get the corresponding number.
[06:25.540 --> 06:27.780]  Clone number one came from plant number one.
[06:27.780 --> 06:30.080]  Clones number two came from plant number two.
[06:30.080 --> 06:32.180]  Clones labeled three came from plant three.
[06:32.180 --> 06:33.020]  Makes it easy.
[06:33.020 --> 06:35.460]  So if my plant number five shows that it's a male,
[06:35.460 --> 06:37.500]  clone five is a male, it goes bye-bye.
[06:37.500 --> 06:39.180]  If number one shows it's a girl,
[06:39.180 --> 06:40.720]  number one is a girl, it gets to stay.
[06:40.720 --> 06:41.560]  That's the way that works.
[06:41.560 --> 06:43.000]  So we eliminate the boys.
[06:43.000 --> 06:45.060]  Now we grow out the females.
[06:45.060 --> 06:45.940]  Pay attention.
[06:45.940 --> 06:47.940]  Some of them you're gonna love, some you're gonna hate.
[06:47.940 --> 06:50.180]  Find the one that you really, really do love.
[06:50.180 --> 06:51.220]  The first time I run it,
[06:51.220 --> 06:53.520]  I may keep two, maybe three of the females.
[06:53.520 --> 06:54.900]  We've eliminated the boys.
[06:54.900 --> 06:56.980]  We've gotten rid of the non-desirable females.
[06:56.980 --> 06:59.380]  Now let's really run these girls one more time
[06:59.380 --> 07:00.620]  and see what we really love.
[07:00.620 --> 07:02.200]  I don't know what you're gonna do.
[07:02.200 --> 07:03.220]  You could do it the one time.
[07:03.220 --> 07:04.520]  You could do it a couple times.
[07:04.520 --> 07:06.240]  Find the girls you like.
[07:06.240 --> 07:07.920]  In this case, we're just gonna pick one.
[07:07.920 --> 07:10.040]  We're gonna say we found the one that we really liked.
[07:10.040 --> 07:11.440]  We're gonna say it was number two.
[07:11.440 --> 07:13.360]  In my case, it often is number two.
[07:13.360 --> 07:15.780]  Number one's a boy, number two is quite often the keeper.
[07:15.780 --> 07:16.680]  Number four is a champ.
[07:16.680 --> 07:18.680]  It's just weird luck of the draw for me.
[07:18.680 --> 07:20.640]  So number two, we're gonna say number two
[07:20.640 --> 07:22.780]  was a fucking amazing female keeper plant.
[07:22.780 --> 07:23.760]  We're gonna keep that, right?
[07:23.760 --> 07:25.920]  We grew it out, we flowered it, we smoked it.
[07:25.920 --> 07:27.000]  It is awesome.
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.440]  Luckily, back in the day, we kept a clone of number two.
[07:30.440 --> 07:31.280]  It's just growing.
[07:31.280 --> 07:32.920]  It's over there in the grow room, just growing.
[07:32.920 --> 07:33.740]  We've still got it.
[07:33.740 --> 07:35.020]  We know number two was the champ.
[07:35.020 --> 07:35.860]  Guess what?
[07:35.860 --> 07:37.260]  That clone that is growing over there,
[07:37.260 --> 07:39.120]  that is now your mother plant.
[07:39.120 --> 07:41.240]  That's how you establish a mother plant.
[07:41.240 --> 07:42.220]  You cut the clone.
[07:42.220 --> 07:45.000]  What I do is I cut the clone off the top of a veg plant.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.280]  I put it in the cloner.
[07:46.280 --> 07:47.300]  I let it clone.
[07:47.300 --> 07:48.140]  I let it root.
[07:48.140 --> 07:49.980]  As soon as it gets roots, I put it in a pot.
[07:49.980 --> 07:51.820]  That's when I flower my other plant.
[07:51.820 --> 07:54.320]  Now I've got nine weeks to find out what the winners are.
[07:54.320 --> 07:57.260]  That other plant's gonna grow over there for nine weeks.
[07:57.260 --> 07:59.720]  Before nine weeks is up, you've probably decided
[07:59.720 --> 08:01.360]  what your favorite plant is.
[08:01.360 --> 08:03.100]  So you've got your favorite selected.
[08:03.100 --> 08:06.540]  Now I would cut clones from my favorite one again,
[08:06.540 --> 08:09.460]  and I've already got clones ready for the next run.
[08:09.460 --> 08:13.180]  So we cut a clone off of our original seeded plant.
[08:13.180 --> 08:14.580]  Just cut a clone right out of the top.
[08:14.580 --> 08:15.660]  Put it in the cloner.
[08:15.660 --> 08:17.780]  It's gonna take two weeks to root-ish.
[08:17.780 --> 08:19.980]  As soon as I see roots, I flower the one
[08:19.980 --> 08:21.420]  that's already in the pot, the big one
[08:21.420 --> 08:22.740]  that the clone came from.
[08:22.740 --> 08:25.380]  We're gonna find the boys and girls, pull out the boys.
[08:25.380 --> 08:26.540]  Find your favorite girl.
[08:26.540 --> 08:27.380]  You'll know.
[08:27.380 --> 08:29.180]  You'll know probably by week seven or week eight
[08:29.180 --> 08:30.780]  what your favorite girls are.
[08:30.780 --> 08:32.740]  Your other plants are over here that you took clones of.
[08:33.380 --> 08:34.220]  They'll have to come out of the cloner.
[08:34.220 --> 08:35.040]  They'll go into pots.
[08:35.040 --> 08:35.880]  They'll start growing.
[08:35.880 --> 08:37.020]  They're gonna get bigger.
[08:37.020 --> 08:39.940]  It's gonna be nine weeks before we need them for anything.
[08:39.940 --> 08:41.860]  My recommendation is around week seven
[08:41.860 --> 08:44.200]  of flower on this run, cut clones.
[08:44.200 --> 08:46.480]  Now those clones become your next run.
[08:46.480 --> 08:47.320]  Guess what?
[08:47.320 --> 08:48.740]  You just cut those from your mother plants
[08:48.740 --> 08:50.220]  that you've got sitting over here.
[08:50.220 --> 08:52.100]  Your favorite one over here will be designated
[08:52.100 --> 08:52.920]  your mother plant.
[08:52.920 --> 08:56.620]  Let's move it over here and focus now on mother plants.
[08:56.620 --> 08:58.300]  We have done a basic pheno hunt.
[08:58.300 --> 09:00.380]  We have found the mother plant we choose to keep.
[09:00.380 --> 09:02.020]  We've got a nice bushy plant
[09:02.020 --> 09:03.860]  of that mother plant right here.
[09:03.860 --> 09:04.700]  We cut a clone.
[09:04.700 --> 09:05.520]  It grew.
[09:05.520 --> 09:06.540]  It's been growing for several weeks.
[09:06.540 --> 09:08.420]  You may have not taken clones off of it by now.
[09:08.420 --> 09:09.480]  You may have.
[09:09.480 --> 09:12.640]  Now's a good time to go and clean up this mother plant.
[09:12.640 --> 09:14.340]  I kind of do a little bit of lollipopping,
[09:14.340 --> 09:16.140]  a little bottoming just to clean it up.
[09:16.140 --> 09:18.580]  It's gonna have some funky, useless shit at the bottom.
[09:18.580 --> 09:20.200]  Just small wispy shoots coming off.
[09:20.200 --> 09:22.140]  I take all that stuff off.
[09:22.140 --> 09:24.540]  Then I wanna make a nice bushy plant
[09:24.540 --> 09:26.380]  because this is going to be the plant
[09:26.380 --> 09:29.760]  that donates a bunch of cuts to me when I need to grow again.
[09:29.760 --> 09:32.260]  So if I need, I know how many clones
[09:32.260 --> 09:33.740]  I'm going to need for my next run.
[09:33.740 --> 09:36.600]  If I know I need three, I don't need super bushy of a plant.
[09:36.600 --> 09:39.760]  If I need 25 cuts, I need to start topping this plant
[09:39.760 --> 09:42.400]  strategically to make more branches and more arms
[09:42.400 --> 09:43.960]  so that I can produce more clones
[09:43.960 --> 09:46.080]  to supply my growth for the next run.
[09:46.080 --> 09:48.120]  And then every time you top it at the right spot,
[09:48.120 --> 09:49.760]  it's gonna produce double the nodes.
[09:49.760 --> 09:51.100]  So the next time you run it,
[09:51.100 --> 09:53.320]  you should have plenty of clones available for the next run.
[09:53.320 --> 09:54.680]  If you got 25 this time,
[09:54.680 --> 09:56.440]  you should be able to get 50 next time.
[09:56.440 --> 09:59.160]  No problem because you doubled all of the spaces.
[09:59.160 --> 10:01.480]  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep
[10:01.480 --> 10:05.360]  this big mother plant nice and healthy, as healthy as I can.
[10:05.360 --> 10:08.320]  I'm going to keep it under at least 18 hours of light
[10:08.320 --> 10:10.120]  and six hours of darkness.
[10:10.120 --> 10:12.660]  A lot of times I will go 19 hours of light
[10:12.660 --> 10:14.520]  and five hours of darkness
[10:14.520 --> 10:16.820]  just to prevent any sort of auto flower,
[10:16.820 --> 10:18.520]  any sort of ideas that that plant
[10:18.520 --> 10:20.800]  could have darkness long enough to flower.
[10:20.800 --> 10:22.200]  I do give them sleep time.
[10:22.200 --> 10:25.060]  I believe anything wants a little bit of sleepy time.
[10:25.060 --> 10:26.960]  You need a nap, the dog needs a nap,
[10:26.960 --> 10:28.080]  the plants can use a nap.
[10:28.080 --> 10:30.600]  Also your equipment can use a nap.
[10:30.600 --> 10:32.780]  If we turn off the lights for just four or five hours
[10:32.780 --> 10:35.060]  a night, that will save us a lot of electricity,
[10:35.060 --> 10:36.600]  a lot of time on your bulbs,
[10:36.600 --> 10:38.460]  a lot of time on the air conditioner,
[10:38.460 --> 10:40.320]  a lot of things that don't have to run
[10:40.320 --> 10:41.200]  unless it's the winter
[10:41.200 --> 10:42.520]  and then you got to turn on a heater.
[10:42.520 --> 10:44.280]  That's a whole nother conversation.
[10:44.280 --> 10:46.360]  Keep them under at least 18 hours of light.
[10:46.360 --> 10:48.920]  Some people will go 19, some people will go 20,
[10:48.920 --> 10:50.160]  some will do the 24.
[10:50.160 --> 10:51.540]  That is not my recommendation.
[10:51.540 --> 10:53.360]  Once again, we all need a nap.
[10:53.360 --> 10:55.680]  You'll notice that they'll start getting spindly
[10:55.680 --> 10:57.800]  and growing too tall and getting weird on you
[10:58.520 --> 10:59.480]  if you don't give them any night time.
[10:59.480 --> 11:01.800]  I do think that weird growth is a symptom of them.
[11:01.800 --> 11:03.160]  Just they're freaking out, dude.
[11:03.160 --> 11:04.880]  They're going crazy, they need a nap.
[11:04.880 --> 11:07.000]  Feed them, excuse me, feed them.
[11:07.000 --> 11:09.040]  Another very important thing is to feed them.
[11:09.040 --> 11:10.880]  I feed them a high nitrogen diet.
[11:10.880 --> 11:14.380]  I focus on just mainly the basic NPK.
[11:14.380 --> 11:17.560]  In a good vegetative nutrient solution,
[11:17.560 --> 11:19.160]  you will get most of the things needed
[11:19.160 --> 11:20.040]  for your mother plants.
[11:20.040 --> 11:21.740]  They may need a little bit of cow mag.
[11:21.740 --> 11:23.560]  Definitely feed them microbes.
[11:23.560 --> 11:27.680]  One thing is I really step up my pesticide application
[11:28.520 --> 11:30.640]  or my integrated pest management routine
[11:30.640 --> 11:32.520]  in the mother room area
[11:32.520 --> 11:34.620]  because it all starts with healthy mother plants.
[11:34.620 --> 11:36.360]  If your moms start getting healthy,
[11:36.360 --> 11:39.280]  your stock is, or if they start getting unhealthy,
[11:39.280 --> 11:40.760]  your stock is unhealthy.
[11:40.760 --> 11:42.200]  It all starts right there.
[11:42.200 --> 11:44.960]  So have very healthy mother plants if at all possible.
[11:44.960 --> 11:46.640]  Keep insects away from them.
[11:46.640 --> 11:48.480]  Keep powdery mildew away from them.
[11:48.480 --> 11:50.040]  Keep any viruses away from them.
[11:50.040 --> 11:51.420]  Keep those mother plants clean.
[11:51.420 --> 11:52.360]  Those are sacred.
[11:52.360 --> 11:53.760]  As a breeder, that's my,
[11:53.760 --> 11:56.160]  that's everything sacred to me is those mother plants.
[11:56.160 --> 11:58.240]  So keep them clean, safe, and healthy.
[11:58.240 --> 12:01.480]  Up your, step up your integrated pest management game
[12:01.480 --> 12:04.120]  in that room is where it all starts.
[12:04.120 --> 12:06.880]  If you can't get healthy cuts, you can't get healthy plants.
[12:06.880 --> 12:08.200]  If you can't have healthy veg plants,
[12:08.200 --> 12:09.780]  you can't have healthy flower plants.
[12:09.780 --> 12:10.960]  You can't breed healthy seeds.
[12:10.960 --> 12:12.960]  It all starts with healthy moms,
[12:12.960 --> 12:14.700]  healthy clones, healthy veg.
[12:14.700 --> 12:16.200]  Get those mother plants super healthy.
[12:16.200 --> 12:18.020]  So give them a lot of light.
[12:18.020 --> 12:20.660]  Give them a lot of strong vegetative nutrients.
[12:20.660 --> 12:23.600]  Then also give them a lot of cleanliness.
[12:23.600 --> 12:25.080]  Give them a lot of pest management.
[12:25.080 --> 12:26.760]  Make sure there are no bugs on there.
[12:26.760 --> 12:28.480]  That's where it all starts.
[12:28.480 --> 12:30.640]  Now, something else to talk about
[12:30.640 --> 12:32.180]  is the goal and shape of your plants.
[12:32.180 --> 12:34.160]  How many clones do you need?
[12:34.160 --> 12:36.520]  I top them early because when I top them,
[12:36.520 --> 12:38.960]  all those lower branches start growing up.
[12:38.960 --> 12:41.320]  Now think about when you, you've got an intersection.
[12:41.320 --> 12:42.860]  We call it a node.
[12:42.860 --> 12:44.200]  So you've got the branch coming up
[12:44.200 --> 12:47.000]  and shooting off to the left is just one more little space.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.080]  And then right above that going off to the right
[12:49.080 --> 12:51.380]  is one more little space, little branches.
[12:51.380 --> 12:52.880]  So if you cut that one out of the middle,
[12:52.880 --> 12:54.720]  you've now got the one going up off the left
[12:55.360 --> 12:56.360]  and the one going up off the right.
[12:56.360 --> 12:57.880]  Those eventually will even out
[12:57.880 --> 13:00.480]  and start growing as new apical dominant tops.
[13:00.480 --> 13:02.840]  If you top it right, think about that strategically
[13:02.840 --> 13:04.140]  when you were cutting it.
[13:04.140 --> 13:05.640]  Think about the plant kind of,
[13:05.640 --> 13:07.520]  it looks like I'm giving you the finger here on the camera.
[13:07.520 --> 13:08.360]  I'm not.
[13:08.360 --> 13:09.920]  It looks like a three,
[13:09.920 --> 13:11.560]  it looks like a peace sign turned upside down.
[13:11.560 --> 13:13.040]  You got the one going up the middle.
[13:13.040 --> 13:14.780]  Then you got your left branch and your right branch.
[13:14.780 --> 13:15.960]  If you cut that one out the middle,
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.600]  that's a much better hand gesture there.
[13:17.600 --> 13:18.700]  If you cut that one out the middle,
[13:18.700 --> 13:21.100]  these two will compete and become new tops.
[13:21.100 --> 13:23.000]  Later on, those will both become clones.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.520]  So take out this clone now.
[13:25.280 --> 13:26.120]  You get these two in the future.
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.000]  Then those two, repeat the process.
[13:28.000 --> 13:29.520]  You get four, repeat the process.
[13:29.520 --> 13:31.360]  You get eight, repeat the process.
[13:31.360 --> 13:33.240]  It becomes into like fucking 64, right?
[13:33.240 --> 13:35.640]  If you do it, it's mathematically bra.
[13:35.640 --> 13:37.680]  So keep cutting, keep cutting them, keep topping,
[13:37.680 --> 13:39.320]  and you will make more tops.
[13:39.320 --> 13:41.520]  Something that will happen eventually,
[13:41.520 --> 13:43.040]  this will happen.
[13:43.040 --> 13:45.680]  You could do this process as long as you want,
[13:45.680 --> 13:47.360]  but eventually you're going to need
[13:47.360 --> 13:49.800]  to replace your mother plant.
[13:49.800 --> 13:51.140]  Right now people are going to say,
[13:51.140 --> 13:52.320]  what about genetic drift?
[13:52.320 --> 13:53.160]  That is not a thing.
[13:53.160 --> 13:55.440]  I've done a full podcast on why genetic drift
[13:55.440 --> 13:56.560]  does not apply to cannabis
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.200]  and why it doesn't apply to cloning cannabis.
[13:59.200 --> 14:01.480]  So wash genetic drift right out of your brain.
[14:01.480 --> 14:02.320]  That's not a thing.
[14:02.320 --> 14:03.760]  If your mother plants are healthy,
[14:03.760 --> 14:05.160]  you cut clones properly,
[14:05.160 --> 14:06.880]  genetic drift will not be a thing.
[14:06.880 --> 14:08.320]  I've done a full episode on that.
[14:08.320 --> 14:10.440]  Do some research, check out the episode.
[14:10.440 --> 14:11.960]  One thing that will need to be done
[14:11.960 --> 14:14.800]  is you will need to re-clone your mother plants.
[14:14.800 --> 14:16.720]  They will get big, they will get tall.
[14:16.720 --> 14:19.000]  They'll start getting old, they'll get out of control.
[14:19.000 --> 14:20.640]  That plant is, it's old.
[14:20.640 --> 14:22.940]  No matter how long, every time you clone the plant,
[14:23.720 --> 14:25.180]  that plant is still as old as that original clone.
[14:25.180 --> 14:26.740]  So it's got that much age on it.
[14:26.740 --> 14:28.100]  We've got to keep these plants fresh.
[14:28.100 --> 14:29.140]  We've got to re-clone them.
[14:29.140 --> 14:31.500]  What I do every three to six months,
[14:31.500 --> 14:32.620]  depending on the plant,
[14:33.540 --> 14:35.220]  the SunKiss plant doesn't grow super,
[14:35.220 --> 14:37.940]  or the Platinum Tangy doesn't grow super fast.
[14:37.940 --> 14:40.300]  It stays kind of smaller, doesn't take as much time.
[14:40.300 --> 14:42.220]  MAC-1 doesn't take as much time.
[14:42.220 --> 14:44.740]  I can remomb that one every six months.
[14:44.740 --> 14:46.840]  The Mighty Congo, the Kemde La Kem,
[14:46.840 --> 14:49.340]  they need remombed about every three months.
[14:49.340 --> 14:52.940]  So what I do, I simply cut a nice batch of clones.
[14:52.940 --> 14:56.420]  I probably cut one row, five clones off of each plant.
[14:56.420 --> 14:59.540]  So we got five Congo, we got five Kemde La Kems.
[14:59.540 --> 15:01.340]  And then I just let those root.
[15:01.340 --> 15:03.020]  And the best two, I pot them.
[15:03.020 --> 15:04.580]  The best two of each one, I pot them,
[15:04.580 --> 15:05.860]  then I let them grow.
[15:05.860 --> 15:07.660]  The best one goes in the flower room.
[15:07.660 --> 15:09.800]  The second best one becomes the new mother plant.
[15:09.800 --> 15:11.020]  That becomes my new genetic.
[15:11.020 --> 15:13.900]  That's the one that I get to grow from from now on.
[15:13.900 --> 15:15.980]  And that's gonna repeat the process forever.
[15:15.980 --> 15:18.240]  Then that big plant that I cut the clones from,
[15:18.240 --> 15:20.960]  I either flower that, which most of the time I do not do,
[15:20.960 --> 15:23.680]  or I simply cut it into small pieces and throw it away
[15:23.680 --> 15:25.060]  because I don't need it.
[15:25.060 --> 15:28.080]  I don't feel the need to just grow it because I've got it.
[15:28.080 --> 15:29.760]  That's not what that plant was meant for.
[15:29.760 --> 15:31.400]  It was meant to provide clones.
[15:31.400 --> 15:32.440]  It served its purpose.
[15:32.440 --> 15:34.040]  I've got all the cuts I need.
[15:34.040 --> 15:36.240]  I can chop that big bad dog down and throw it away.
[15:36.240 --> 15:38.120]  Sometimes they'll go outside.
[15:38.120 --> 15:39.880]  Sometimes they get flowered in a flower room.
[15:39.880 --> 15:41.420]  Sometimes they get pollinated.
[15:41.420 --> 15:43.160]  Most of the time it's better for me
[15:43.160 --> 15:44.680]  just to eliminate that plant,
[15:44.680 --> 15:46.360]  start fresh with those new cuts.
[15:46.360 --> 15:48.080]  They're already so big, they're already stretched out.
[15:48.920 --> 15:49.760]  That's why I'm remomming it.
[15:49.760 --> 15:51.080]  They just get out of control.
[15:51.080 --> 15:52.680]  They get unruly and unshapely.
[15:52.680 --> 15:54.860]  If you're not strategically cloning it all the time
[15:54.860 --> 15:56.880]  and on top of it, it will get out of control.
[15:56.880 --> 15:59.400]  And even if so, it will get root bound.
[15:59.400 --> 16:00.380]  It'll just get old.
[16:00.380 --> 16:02.440]  Re-clone it, remommate, get it started fresh.
[16:02.440 --> 16:05.380]  I do that again about every three to six months
[16:05.380 --> 16:07.560]  is how I redo my moms.
[16:07.560 --> 16:09.800]  Now let's talk about another scenario.
[16:09.800 --> 16:12.320]  I know a lot of people, myself included,
[16:12.320 --> 16:14.000]  I'm here in Colorado.
[16:14.000 --> 16:16.720]  In my personal grow, I'm very limited on the amount
[16:16.720 --> 16:18.560]  of plants that I would like to have.
[16:18.560 --> 16:21.780]  So instead of wasting space on mother plants,
[16:21.780 --> 16:23.820]  in some cases what we will do,
[16:23.820 --> 16:27.740]  we will use a dedicated veg plant as our mother plant.
[16:27.740 --> 16:29.680]  So let's just say you grew your,
[16:29.680 --> 16:30.640]  you've got a clone, right?
[16:30.640 --> 16:32.160]  You know that this clone is the winner.
[16:32.160 --> 16:34.200]  You've done your pheno hunt, you've got the winner.
[16:34.200 --> 16:35.640]  You've got your clone right here.
[16:35.640 --> 16:37.560]  You just, right before you're gonna flower,
[16:37.560 --> 16:39.960]  take a couple of clones off of it and save them.
[16:39.960 --> 16:43.660]  And now you've got three or five clones in the cloning area.
[16:43.660 --> 16:45.680]  You move that plant into the flowering room.
[16:45.680 --> 16:47.040]  It'll flower in nine weeks.
[16:47.040 --> 16:49.280]  Now your clones are in there for two weeks.
[16:49.280 --> 16:50.880]  They come out of the cloner.
[16:50.880 --> 16:51.880]  They go into their pots.
[16:51.880 --> 16:53.760]  They got two weeks in the cloner.
[16:53.760 --> 16:55.560]  Two or three weeks in the small pots
[16:55.560 --> 16:57.120]  and then like six weeks, no, what do we got?
[16:57.120 --> 16:59.400]  That's five, you got four weeks in the bigger pots.
[16:59.400 --> 17:01.200]  Then move those right into flower
[17:01.200 --> 17:02.920]  and take a couple of cuts off of them
[17:02.920 --> 17:05.520]  and use your veg plants as your mother plant.
[17:05.520 --> 17:07.720]  Kind of keep a perpetual cycle going.
[17:07.720 --> 17:09.560]  People are gonna say, what about genetic drift?
[17:09.560 --> 17:11.160]  Again, I'm gonna say that is not a thing.
[17:11.160 --> 17:13.640]  As long as you are keeping your plants healthy,
[17:13.640 --> 17:15.080]  excuse me, as long as your veg plants,
[17:15.920 --> 17:17.000]  your donor plant is what I wanna call it,
[17:17.000 --> 17:17.840]  is a healthy plant.
[17:17.840 --> 17:19.320]  Your clones will come out healthily.
[17:19.320 --> 17:21.760]  If you do it properly, take good care of them.
[17:21.760 --> 17:24.120]  I've done full episodes on clone care,
[17:24.120 --> 17:24.960]  all of that stuff.
[17:24.960 --> 17:25.780]  That's another topic.
[17:25.780 --> 17:27.600]  But let me talk about how to do that again
[17:27.600 --> 17:28.800]  because I feel like I breezed over it.
[17:28.800 --> 17:30.080]  You've got your plant.
[17:30.080 --> 17:31.120]  You're gonna flower it.
[17:31.120 --> 17:33.680]  That plant is your mom plant and your flower plant.
[17:33.680 --> 17:36.440]  It's a veg plant that will be flowered at the same time.
[17:36.440 --> 17:38.640]  You got a plant, put it into the flower room, right?
[17:38.640 --> 17:40.080]  Before you change the light cycle,
[17:40.080 --> 17:41.960]  take three to five clones off of it.
[17:41.960 --> 17:43.720]  Those clones will be the next run.
[17:43.800 --> 17:45.640]  While this bad dog is flowering,
[17:45.640 --> 17:46.960]  your clones are rooting.
[17:46.960 --> 17:48.240]  They'll root, they'll take two weeks.
[17:48.240 --> 17:49.820]  As soon as these plants in the flower room
[17:49.820 --> 17:52.120]  start showing sex and going into flower,
[17:52.120 --> 17:55.320]  you've got plants to move from a clone dome into pots.
[17:55.320 --> 17:57.040]  As soon as they really start banging out flower,
[17:57.040 --> 17:58.920]  you gotta up-pot these and get them ready.
[17:58.920 --> 18:00.780]  Start prepping them for the next run.
[18:00.780 --> 18:03.160]  Slide them into flower as soon as these finish.
[18:03.160 --> 18:04.320]  Take a couple of clones.
[18:04.320 --> 18:05.240]  Repeat the process.
[18:05.240 --> 18:07.880]  You've got a perpetual cycle without keeping mother plants
[18:07.880 --> 18:11.620]  because you're keeping veg mother plants at the same time.
[18:11.620 --> 18:14.140]  All right, ladies, gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps,
[18:14.140 --> 18:16.860]  hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[18:16.860 --> 18:19.100]  mothers, fathers, pollen chuckers,
