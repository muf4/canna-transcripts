[02:48.260 --> 02:52.980]  the cartridges for the pens. They take all their ground up leftover material and feed that to the
[02:52.980 --> 02:55.140]  worms that are running the worm farm. Jay Goulden, Jr.: That's awesome.
[02:55.140 --> 02:59.220]  Trey Lockerbie, Jr.: It's going from plant to worm to plant to worm. We're keeping it in the
[02:59.220 --> 03:03.700]  cycle and recycling it. Big, huge shout out to all of the sponsors. Oh, since these guys are here,

[03:43.300 --> 03:47.460]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah. We were talking about the booth and everything that's going on.
[03:47.460 --> 03:50.660]  Absolutely. Busy, busy year ahead. Full tour.
[03:50.660 --> 03:52.500]  Full tour. So you're going to do every cup?
[03:52.500 --> 03:56.100]  Just about, yeah. We're probably going to skip Seattle this year, but we are doing Oregon,
[03:56.100 --> 04:03.780]  Michigan, Denver. We'll also be doing the 710 Cup in Denver and we have the San Francisco Cup.
[04:03.780 --> 04:06.980]  San Francisco. So Sour Seeds is killing it. Is Cannaventure joining for everything?
[04:07.540 --> 04:09.220]  Yeah, I think so. I think so. Yeah.
[04:09.220 --> 04:11.620]  Absolutely. Nice. What are you smoking on over there, bro?
[04:12.260 --> 04:14.740]  Some Jeff's. Oh, you got the Jeff's. What are you smoking on?
[04:14.740 --> 04:18.740]  This is a Dante. It is a... Come from pharmaceuticals in Denver, actually.
[04:18.740 --> 04:19.380]  Oh, nice.
[04:19.380 --> 04:23.140]  We acquired the cut through Dan Hayett, who was recently in Tide Times last year. He's a
[04:23.460 --> 04:29.860]  homegrown Pueblo caregiver right here. He tested out a couple of strains. His Dante tested 28.8 and
[04:29.860 --> 04:32.260]  his kilowatt was 29.3.
[04:32.260 --> 04:33.700]  Wow. Impressive test.
[04:33.700 --> 04:38.740]  It was. They actually tested it three times over each test. They did the first sample for the first
[04:38.740 --> 04:42.420]  $50 and then they gave him the rest of the samples for free just to make sure they didn't make a
[04:42.420 --> 04:43.460]  mistake. It was so high.
[04:43.460 --> 04:44.100]  Sweet.
[04:44.100 --> 04:48.580]  So yeah, he's been doing a lot of things. He was working with Dan Skye from High Times
[04:49.540 --> 04:54.740]  Magazine right now and he's out in Westcliff doing his thing this year. Hopefully, we'll see him
[04:54.740 --> 04:55.220]  around.
[04:55.220 --> 04:58.740]  Yeah. He's invited to the podcast if you want to bring him on. I think I know the guy.
[04:58.740 --> 04:59.140]  Yeah.
[04:59.140 --> 04:59.700]  I think I know who you're talking about.
[04:59.700 --> 05:04.260]  Yeah. Dan the man. He used to come to the shop all the time. He's a good guy. Good guy, man. Yeah.
[05:04.260 --> 05:09.460]  He gave me the cut and it's actually pineapple grenades crossed with a skunk triple six.
[05:09.460 --> 05:10.100]  Very cool.
[05:10.100 --> 05:14.660]  So we've taken it now and we're taking it a step further and creating the Dante's Inferno, which
[05:14.660 --> 05:18.260]  is the same hybrid crossed out with the OG-18.
[05:18.900 --> 05:22.820]  Oh, nice. Nice. I was actually going to ask a few breeding questions and stuff of you on the show,
[05:22.820 --> 05:27.540]  but it sounds like a good time. My first question is going to be to both of you guys. How did you
[05:27.540 --> 05:29.940]  get into the breeding game and how long have you been breeding?
[05:29.940 --> 05:34.260]  I've actually been breeding since I was about 15 or 16 years old. My parents were long-time
[05:34.260 --> 05:38.340]  growers in the state of Florida, South Florida. We were underground growers. We had large
[05:38.340 --> 05:43.540]  horticulture nursery, about five and a half, six acres. We had a whiteout greenhouse. It was a
[05:44.420 --> 05:45.540]  30 by 100 feet.
[05:46.260 --> 05:46.980]  Full of cannabis?
[05:46.980 --> 05:47.700]  Full of cannabis.
[05:47.700 --> 05:48.260]  In Florida?
[05:48.260 --> 05:48.820]  In Florida.
[05:48.820 --> 05:51.220]  You got balls of steel. Your parents had balls of steel.
[05:51.220 --> 05:55.220]  Yes. My mom actually took her until she was almost 60 years old. And recently,
[05:55.220 --> 05:57.700]  last five years, she actually did get incarcerated.
[05:57.700 --> 05:58.740]  Oh, shit. I'm sorry.
[05:58.740 --> 06:04.020]  Oh, it was kind of messed up because it's just one of those things. Yeah. She was busted with
[06:04.020 --> 06:10.180]  around 24 plants. She did get a slap on the wrist board. And unfortunately for her, they did find
[06:10.180 --> 06:15.300]  out the FBI came in and they were doing a drug sting. The guys were taking the money. They were
[06:15.300 --> 06:19.140]  taking the money. They were stealing the money. They were stealing the cannabis and they were
[06:19.140 --> 06:25.380]  flipping it back on the streets. And about 12 officers were involved in it. And it was in big
[06:25.380 --> 06:27.940]  news down in Tampa, Florida last year. So last couple of years.
[06:27.940 --> 06:29.620]  So your mom's kind of a celebrity for cannabis?
[06:29.620 --> 06:32.260]  Pretty much. Absolutely. She's been a freedom fighter her whole life.
[06:32.260 --> 06:34.340]  What do we call her on the show to give her a shout out?
[06:34.340 --> 06:34.980]  Sherry.
[06:34.980 --> 06:35.620]  Mama.
[06:35.620 --> 06:39.220]  Big shout out, Sherry. Big shout out for being a cannabis warrior. Is she free now? Is she out?
[06:39.220 --> 06:42.580]  Yeah, absolutely. She's here and now she's living in Colorado. The great state of Colorado.
[06:42.580 --> 06:43.380]  Keep her out of trouble.
[06:43.380 --> 06:46.420]  That's absolutely it. She's loving the freedom. She's loving the mountains,
[06:46.420 --> 06:49.060]  the atmosphere and the people, man. The people, the attitude's great here.
[06:49.060 --> 06:50.980]  Welcome home, mama. Sour seeds. We're glad to have you.
[06:50.980 --> 06:51.380]  That's right.
[06:51.380 --> 06:55.300]  We'll keep you out of trouble. So Rusty, my friend with Cannaventure, dude, you're a cool
[06:55.300 --> 06:58.100]  ass dude. I'm glad I met you today. We're going to have some fucking fun times together, bro.
[06:58.100 --> 06:58.900]  Absolutely.
[06:58.900 --> 07:00.260]  How long have you been in this breeding game?
[07:02.020 --> 07:04.020]  I guess about six years, but I mean,
[07:04.980 --> 07:11.060]  I've been breeding forever. I mean, who doesn't? I mean, what grower doesn't like see plants?
[07:11.780 --> 07:16.020]  Okay. So that's a good question. How long into your growing career did it take you to get
[07:16.020 --> 07:16.420]  breeding?
[07:17.300 --> 07:24.580]  Man. I'd say for the first, I don't know, four or five years, it was just straight growing.
[07:24.580 --> 07:31.540]  And you first get started, outdoor or whatever. But I'd say like six, seven years before,
[07:31.540 --> 07:32.020]  you know what I mean?
[07:32.020 --> 07:35.140]  That's about right. Well, that's how long it takes you. Four to six years seems to be for
[07:35.140 --> 07:38.500]  most of the major breeders that I've talked to. Like when I grew those plants the first
[07:38.500 --> 07:42.020]  couple of years, I knew I had to breed, but then you have to figure out how and where.
[07:42.020 --> 07:45.060]  Right. I mean, being from the area that we were in, in the underground, you know,
[07:45.060 --> 07:48.980]  you couldn't just back in the early nineties and stuff and being in places like Florida,
[07:48.980 --> 07:52.580]  which is one of the worst states to possibly grow it in Virginia, places like that East
[07:52.580 --> 07:56.980]  coast is really, really throw you under the bus, lock you up. That's about it. You know,
[07:56.980 --> 08:01.940]  and you couldn't really order seeds, you know, and get certain strains. And whenever you got
[08:01.940 --> 08:06.100]  good genetics and you got good males, you may do with what you had. And then you used a lot of
[08:06.100 --> 08:10.500]  older genetics. I personally used a lot of older genetics when we were younger from parents passed
[08:10.500 --> 08:15.620]  down Gainesville, green, old Afghans, a lot of old Afghani and stuff. A lot of the old piney,
[08:15.620 --> 08:18.980]  you know, good piney buds that came out of Florida back in the day in the eighties.
[08:18.980 --> 08:21.300]  And Florida's known for a lot of great things.
[08:21.300 --> 08:24.580]  It is. It really is. In my opinion. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[08:24.580 --> 08:27.540]  The past few years, they've really been being known for it and noticed.
[08:27.540 --> 08:31.220]  Absolutely. You know, I would say in the last 10 years, there's actually been statistics to show
[08:31.220 --> 08:35.780]  that there's more growers indoors that get busted every year in Florida and there are registered
[08:35.780 --> 08:42.020]  cannabis users in California. Wow. Wow. So we say this all the time on this show,
[08:42.020 --> 08:46.180]  the logical step here, fucking legalize it in Florida. Absolutely. Right. Absolutely. I mean,
[08:46.180 --> 08:49.540]  why are you banging down little old ladies, you know, doors and dragging them out?
[08:49.540 --> 08:53.140]  And because your mom, I'm pretty sure at her age now, she's a hardcore criminal, right? I'm sure
[08:53.140 --> 08:57.780]  she was. Oh, absolutely. You know, absolutely. Open the door for him and told him to come right
[08:57.860 --> 09:03.380]  on in. You know, I mean, it was just about, she's one of those type of women, but my mom's really
[09:03.380 --> 09:07.780]  cool lady. She just, uh, she gets you high first and then makes you cookies. There you go. Come on
[09:07.780 --> 09:12.420]  in officer. I'll roll a joint while you cuff everybody. That's a totally her attitude. That's
[09:12.420 --> 09:17.140]  awesome. I'm glad she's here. I hope we get to smoke out one day if she's absolutely a pot smoker.
[09:17.140 --> 09:22.980]  All right. We got to get it back on course, man. We get so ADD in this show. So ADD, that's it,
[09:22.980 --> 09:27.060]  man. What, uh, we kind of skipped over how long you've been breeding a little bit. So you've been
[09:27.220 --> 09:30.100]  for about six years, right? You've been in the, in the game for about six years.
[09:30.740 --> 09:34.500]  I guess I've been selling seeds for like six, six years or so, you know what I mean? But
[09:34.500 --> 09:41.540]  definitely for, uh, uh, since I started, you know, 10, 11 years, something like that.
[09:42.820 --> 09:46.900]  Nice. What's uh, what are some of your favorite strains that you've ordered now? What are some
[09:46.900 --> 09:51.300]  of your now current favorite strains to grow? Uh, what are you, as far as like clone only or
[09:51.860 --> 09:55.220]  whatever you were going to like, if I was like, so you can fill this whole room with whatever you
[09:55.220 --> 10:01.540]  want, you get three strains to pick. Okay. Yeah. I'd say cookie rec, you know, very cool choice.
[10:01.540 --> 10:06.900]  Cookies a little fucking whatever, you know, but out of proportion, but, uh, but no, I've seen a
[10:06.900 --> 10:10.660]  shout out to garden of Weeden grow the shit out of your cookie rack. Yeah. Yeah. Those guys grow
[10:10.660 --> 10:16.340]  the shit out of it. So you owe them a high five. Yeah, for sure. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, I don't
[10:16.340 --> 10:20.420]  know. Uh, triple Nova. That's the newest impact is that Bob brought you today. Okay. You know what
[10:20.420 --> 10:24.660]  I mean? Thanks for that. We'll run that pretty soon to take pictures. Yeah. It's triangle cushion,
[10:24.660 --> 10:30.500]  Blackberry, Cush, Columbia X out cross by train wreck Arcata. That's all your head seeds. Yeah.
[10:30.500 --> 10:40.980]  This BX too. Okay. Uh, my third one, let's see. Uh, okay. I'm working on one now. Uh,
[10:40.980 --> 10:46.500]  Texas kids, bloody Mary cut. I don't know. It's, it's pretty rare cut, but, uh, working that back
[10:46.500 --> 10:57.620]  with, uh, orange diesel, Cali's 77 cut and a Calio cut with their rights or no. Some of those
[10:57.620 --> 11:03.380]  New York city diesel. Oh, very cool. Anything. So my love and that sounds like a great cross there.
[11:03.940 --> 11:08.740]  Now, random question on an offshoot of that. Are those your top sellers by any chance? And I know
[11:08.740 --> 11:11.540]  one can't be because you're still making it, but the cookie rec sounds like it's probably
[11:12.420 --> 11:15.300]  a, that's definitely one. Yeah. That's a great, great strain. I've seen
[11:15.860 --> 11:20.500]  coal in my arms. Yeah. It matches up. Both parents match up just perfect. Perfect. It
[11:20.500 --> 11:24.900]  doesn't sound like it, but once you know, you get to know both parents from the breeder aspect,
[11:24.900 --> 11:28.340]  you could tell that that's the beautiful one because for sure guys, here's a hint that I don't
[11:28.340 --> 11:33.460]  talk about a lot, but more, the more difference, no, the most difference in your parents, the better
[11:33.460 --> 11:37.860]  the outcome in your cross. Right. If you've got completely different parents, the better your
[11:37.860 --> 11:43.300]  crosses are going to be in my opinion. Natural selection. Yes. Yeah. So bro over here, Mr. Sour
[11:43.300 --> 11:47.300]  seeds. Uh, what are some of your favorite strains to grow a top three top three? I'd probably say
[11:47.300 --> 11:52.260]  one of my number one strains is still to this day is probably the original Kim dog D or Kim poor.
[11:52.260 --> 11:56.260]  Okay. It's still to this day. It's, it's not the process strain in the world, but it has some of
[11:56.260 --> 12:00.100]  the greatest flavors, you know, all around. It's just got the bang. It's got the flavor. It's got
[12:00.100 --> 12:04.740]  the punch. It's got the yield bag appeal, the yield. It's it's all there. You know, that loud.
[12:04.740 --> 12:09.540]  That's it. And it's one of the original true OGs, you know, and, uh, I'd say right now too,
[12:09.540 --> 12:14.100]  it's still is one of my family's, uh, original strains from way back. We've, we've held this cut
[12:14.100 --> 12:18.100]  for probably close to eight to 10 years now. It's a, one of our original blueberries. It's a, the
[12:18.100 --> 12:22.580]  old original blueberry yum yum used to hear about from ludicrous and back in the day and things like
[12:22.580 --> 12:27.700]  that. It's, it's not DJ's blueberry. It's a very Indica dominant blueberry almost smells like ripe
[12:27.700 --> 12:31.460]  oranges halfway through flowering. And then it really takes on a really sweet blueberry appeal
[12:31.460 --> 12:37.140]  during finish and ripening. Um, very, very potent, very frosty, um, very couch lock,
[12:37.140 --> 12:41.540]  okay. You know, quick eight, nine weeks, or, you know, it's, it's a very Indica plant. It's not
[12:41.540 --> 12:47.220]  going to take you 10 weeks to flower out. Um, and another one we run is, uh, probably a big one that
[12:47.220 --> 12:51.860]  we're having a big release on now is, uh, the space dragon, which is a true West Himalayan
[12:51.860 --> 12:58.180]  Cush land race crossed with the original Kim 91 back cross male. So this was, this was a cross
[12:58.180 --> 13:02.500]  that was done probably seven, eight years ago in Florida. And right now it's one of the hottest
[13:02.500 --> 13:08.100]  things in Atlanta, Georgia has been for years down there and ran Tallahassee, Florida and FSU college
[13:08.100 --> 13:12.820]  for, I don't know how many years we slung that stuff out on the streets and, uh, people can't
[13:12.820 --> 13:16.980]  get enough of it. We've, we've gotten reviews from everywhere from, you know, the little guy to,
[13:16.980 --> 13:23.540]  uh, people that fight for the UFC. Um, we, we, we've actually sold pot to people like Sebastian,
[13:23.540 --> 13:28.820]  Sebastian Janikowski and, uh, you know, big football players. And I mean, it's, it's the,
[13:28.820 --> 13:32.660]  the, the guys, they, they just can't, they can't get enough of the space dragon, man. It's just,
[13:32.660 --> 13:36.900]  it's, it's strong. It's devastating. It lays you out and, and then you really can't think on it.
[13:36.900 --> 13:40.660]  You know, it's one of those, even for the heavy smoker, if you're looking for something like that,
[13:40.660 --> 13:43.940]  that just re you really want to get stoned, you know what I mean? Just really, I mean,
[13:43.940 --> 13:47.700]  cause you build up tolerance over years and years of doing this and you'd look for
[13:47.700 --> 13:51.940]  sought out strains that you, you know, that, that won't burn you out. And you know, seven,
[13:51.940 --> 13:55.540]  eight years, I can still smoke this stuff and it still does the same effect in me that it did
[13:55.540 --> 13:59.780]  back in the day, you know? And so we're, so we're trying to, that's kind of an old school,
[13:59.780 --> 14:04.260]  new school kind of a combo there. It is, it is like, like you said, very diverse genetics,
[14:04.260 --> 14:07.780]  you know, taking something from here in America and then taking the best of the, you know,
[14:07.780 --> 14:11.540]  the, you know, and across the world, you know, and just trying to combine those genetics to
[14:11.540 --> 14:17.540]  give somebody something really, really special. I'm imagining kind of a real spicy, uh, real
[14:17.540 --> 14:21.620]  hashy, earthy, spicy kind of a smell. It is real earthy and it has a spice to it, but it's actually,
[14:21.620 --> 14:26.580]  it, it's really hard to really describe Jeff. It's, it's, it's, it's been described as like
[14:26.580 --> 14:31.060]  really sweet, but also has like a very overwhelming scent of BO like body odor.
[14:31.060 --> 14:35.220]  I love that kind of weed. The Jeff's OG he's playing with has a, like a swampy,
[14:35.220 --> 14:40.020]  funky foot BO kind of a touch to it. Exactly. It's really BO to it, but it's, it's on the sweeter
[14:40.020 --> 14:44.420]  side and it's has that, the kind of citrusy twang kind of funk from the chem 91 in there.
[14:45.220 --> 14:49.380]  You know, it's, it's really original. It's really, really unique. And anybody that's ever had,
[14:49.380 --> 14:54.100]  it's really, truly enjoyed it. Nice. Well, I look forward to my seed pack. Absolutely. Absolutely.
[14:54.100 --> 14:58.580]  Coming soon. Or my clone, you know, there's yeah, I can do that for you. There's nothing like a
[14:58.580 --> 15:02.580]  clone from your bro. Uh, so that was two strains. You got the chem and then you got your space
[15:02.580 --> 15:05.860]  dragon. What's strain number three. That was the blueberry. Oh, the blueberry. You're right. Sorry.
[15:05.860 --> 15:11.540]  I see dabs. I'm going to blame it on a head injury. I can probably do one or two more episodes.
[15:11.780 --> 15:17.300]  I mean, if you guys have been listening and you heard about that, I had a serious,
[15:17.300 --> 15:22.260]  I had a serious concussion, but I had a minor brain bleed and I was down for about,
[15:22.260 --> 15:26.260]  it's been seven days now and I'm still a little goofy when I wake up and it takes me like an hour
[15:26.260 --> 15:29.780]  to get my shit together, but I'm going to be fine guys. A couple of people told me to get well and
[15:29.780 --> 15:33.780]  I appreciate it. Yeah. My brain was bleeding inside my head. It's crazy. My eyes were wobbling
[15:33.780 --> 15:37.540]  and shit. That was a little goofy. So if you've listened to the last two episodes, I was doing
[15:37.860 --> 15:45.620]  fully concussed. Yeah, it's good. Uh, apparently I blew off two people. I was supposed to meet
[15:45.620 --> 15:51.300]  somebody somewhere and I blew them off completely. Like I had no idea. And so somebody was nice
[15:51.300 --> 15:55.140]  enough to say he hit his head. Please be nice about that. Well, at least you had a legitimate
[15:55.140 --> 16:00.340]  excuse this time. I wasn't just dabbing on the couch like last time. All right. Uh, so those
[16:00.340 --> 16:04.900]  are your three favorites. Which of those, Oh, he's coughing. Got to give him a second. So are those,
[16:04.900 --> 16:09.060]  since one's not released yet, are those your best sellers or do you even release the, you can't sell
[16:09.060 --> 16:13.380]  the blueberry yum yum cause it's not yours to release. Right? Well, it is mine to release. Um,
[16:13.380 --> 16:17.460]  so far I'm the only one in Colorado that has that cut. Um, I brought it here from Florida. We
[16:17.460 --> 16:21.940]  actually brought it into computer case, 2000 miles over here. You guys are mad men. We are mad men.
[16:21.940 --> 16:25.700]  We take the risk. We take the risk and we appreciate it. You know, we, we tried to bring
[16:25.700 --> 16:29.620]  some diverse genetics this way. We only brought, you know, a couple of strains with us, but it was
[16:29.620 --> 16:33.940]  our best, you know, and, and that's what we brought with us. Um, a lot of the old, old strains are,
[16:33.940 --> 16:40.020]  are dead and gone. Gainesville green is dead and gone. It is dead and gone. My, my, my uncle
[16:40.020 --> 16:44.100]  actually was, had a big hand in that. And today to this day, you know, he still grows cannabis,
[16:44.100 --> 16:49.380]  but he's completely blind. Wow. And he literally takes care of massive greenhouses and his plants
[16:49.380 --> 16:53.540]  look beautiful and amazing. And he's been growing the same strains, the blueberry yum yum, um,
[16:53.540 --> 16:58.740]  Gainesville green and things like that. And so as far as I know, he, I haven't, I haven't talked
[16:58.740 --> 17:02.980]  to that man in so long. It's, it's, but, uh, it's a good guy to get in contact with man.
[17:02.980 --> 17:08.100]  Absolutely. But you know, it's, it's, it's, it's sad. It's, it's like a lot of the old skunks,
[17:08.100 --> 17:11.780]  the old original scum. They've all, these have been outcrossed. I mean, there's things that you
[17:11.780 --> 17:16.340]  can find in Florida that are very close, but it's an outcross. I grew up in SoCal and there was a
[17:16.340 --> 17:21.940]  skunk strain there that I've never smelled since I've left that area. I was in the long beach area
[17:21.940 --> 17:26.580]  was where my herb was coming from. And dude, I've never smelled anything like it. The closest I've
[17:26.580 --> 17:33.300]  gotten was I was at a Phil Lesh and friends show at red rocks in 1999. And this dude said humble
[17:33.300 --> 17:38.340]  gold for sale. And I was like, Holy shit. Cause I remember the old humble and I walked over there
[17:38.340 --> 17:41.860]  and I was like, how much for a quarter bro? And he's like 90 bucks. And I handed him a hundred
[17:41.860 --> 17:45.140]  dollar bill and just walked away. I was like, have a great weekend, keep the 10 bucks. I'm
[17:46.020 --> 17:52.020]  shit. And that was as close as I've gotten since I left California to the smell of just that Cali
[17:52.020 --> 17:56.900]  dank. I kind of miss it. Yeah. And every once in a while you do, you come across that. And,
[17:56.900 --> 18:01.860]  and, and it's very rare though. Nowadays, you know, that it hasn't been put its hands on or
[18:01.860 --> 18:06.100]  it's really locked down on inner circles. All right. All right. Mr. Canaventure,
[18:06.100 --> 18:10.740]  do you prefer to grow or breed sativas or indica? I said a weird question. I fucked that question
[18:10.740 --> 18:14.820]  up. Do you prefer to grow and breed indicors or sativas is what I was aiming for. Man, you take
[18:14.820 --> 18:21.940]  more dabs. I'm going to dabble. You answer. Yeah. Oh man. Preferably man. I like, I like to smoke
[18:21.940 --> 18:27.220]  like sativa hybrids. You know what I mean? Okay. So, I mean, I don't know. I do, I do breed with
[18:27.220 --> 18:31.140]  some straight up a hundred percent indica stick real dominant indica down stuff, but
[18:31.940 --> 18:36.500]  we got to keep those. You have to. Yeah. You know, the CBD patients and the indica patients
[18:36.500 --> 18:40.020]  need their medicine too. Yeah. Yeah. All right. So you have to, you have to, you have to. So a
[18:40.020 --> 18:44.340]  little bit of both. I, I tend to catch myself breeding heavier toward the sativa side just
[18:44.420 --> 18:50.260]  because you like it. I like this. I think that 10 or 17 day extra longer flowering period really
[18:50.260 --> 18:53.940]  does something to a plant. I'm just not an indica smoker. You know, even at nighttime,
[18:53.940 --> 18:58.100]  dude, I, you know, now that I've gotten older, I feel like smoking indica just makes me too lazy.
[18:58.100 --> 19:02.100]  I own a company. I've got gardens. I've got a job. I got shit to do. You know, I gotta be,
[19:02.100 --> 19:06.740]  so I take dabs of sativa to keep me moving and motivated. I don't even smoke. I really don't
[19:06.740 --> 19:12.340]  smoke. I mean, yeah, I really don't smoke indica man. You know what I mean? Good enough. Yeah. I
[19:12.340 --> 19:17.620]  mean you still have some that you love, you know, that you know that are good, but I don't know,
[19:17.620 --> 19:22.820]  preferably. Yeah. Something I find weird. I like growing, smoking and breeding completely
[19:22.820 --> 19:26.100]  different strains for different reasons. If I'm going to grow one, I'd pick a room for growth.
[19:26.100 --> 19:30.420]  If I'm going to breed, I want these. And if I'm going to smoke, I want this like completely
[19:30.420 --> 19:35.060]  different batches of plants. Yeah. How about yourself, man? Do you prefer? I'm actually an
[19:35.060 --> 19:38.660]  indica guy. I'm an indica guy and I like OG cushions a lot. That's, that's pretty much what
[19:38.660 --> 19:42.020]  I like. I like stuff that puts me to the couch. I kind of need it nowadays. I've been doing this
[19:42.100 --> 19:47.460]  a really long time and I've always had a lot of strong pot around. That's the thing with me. I
[19:47.460 --> 19:52.740]  didn't really grow up smoking swag. I always had good homegrown, you know, and then build the
[19:52.740 --> 19:57.060]  tolerance. See, whenever you're like 15 years old and you can outsmoke your, you know, your parents.
[19:57.060 --> 20:02.820]  Yeah. But, um, you know, so, so it takes something like that for me, but like, like you said, like
[20:02.820 --> 20:06.580]  when I, when I'm working, um, if I'm doing some like, you know, heavy labor or anything like that,
[20:06.580 --> 20:10.500]  working in the gardens and things like that is the great that's, that's when the blue dream comes out,
[20:11.460 --> 20:15.860]  you know, and yeah, that's pretty much my main Satiba that I will run is my Cali cut blue dream.
[20:15.860 --> 20:20.500]  All right. Is that the cut that goes around this town a lot? Real tall. It is got the kind of nice
[20:20.500 --> 20:25.460]  thin blade. Super, super frosty. I hit that with a grateful dog pollen and she's been called blue
[20:25.460 --> 20:30.260]  healer. Yeah, absolutely. She does that, that, that cut does wonderful work with every, it is
[20:30.260 --> 20:35.060]  a true breeding cut. I can't hardly get it to, it is a hard to cut even to get to reverse. It is,
[20:35.060 --> 20:39.380]  yeah, it is so safe, stable. You can stress it out, kick it down the street. It's going to perform
[20:39.380 --> 20:43.140]  every single time, no matter really what you hit it with. I haven't talked about this on the show
[20:43.140 --> 20:46.740]  and this is way off the topic that I had written, but you guys will be two people that appreciate
[20:46.740 --> 20:51.540]  this. Actually, I should ask, do you work with any, uh, Feminized seeds, bro? I do, man. Okay.
[20:51.540 --> 20:55.620]  Okay. Dude, I don't, I've been playing it for, I've been talking about it for probably three or
[20:55.620 --> 21:02.420]  four years. I don't know. I feel like it's selling out a little bit, but, but look, okay, let me clear
[21:02.420 --> 21:08.980]  myself. It's taken me a while to get there, but there is absolutely a purpose for it. You know
[21:08.980 --> 21:14.180]  what I mean? I mean, totally, you know, it's undeniable really, honestly. The reason I did it
[21:14.180 --> 21:19.380]  was because I wanted to replicate a strain that I didn't have a good, another cross for. I was like,
[21:19.380 --> 21:23.140]  I don't want to outbreed. I want to duplicate that. And so I just self did and made, that's
[21:23.140 --> 21:28.420]  how I made it. 85%, you know what I mean? Right off the bat. You know what I mean? So, okay.
[21:28.420 --> 21:32.020]  Totally, totally. It was definitely a reason for it. It's easy to do. You know what I mean? There's
[21:32.020 --> 21:36.900]  not a whole lot going on there. Just reverse a plant, you know? I don't, I don't make as near
[21:36.900 --> 21:40.900]  as much pollen as I do. No, definitely not. And that's, that's why I don't, that's you guys,
[21:40.900 --> 21:44.420]  that's why everybody's sold out of my seeds right now. Cause I can't make enough pollen.
[21:44.420 --> 21:47.860]  It's definitely a sacrifice. I've got room for all the plants. I just can't make enough pollen
[21:47.860 --> 21:52.740]  to hit all these plants with. It gets ridiculous. And then I'll tell you why I was talking about
[21:52.740 --> 21:56.660]  feminized seeds. I'm honestly going to try to remember while I take this down. Hit your head.
[21:58.740 --> 22:05.700]  Now there's a purpose for sure. Absolutely. You know, you know, like, like Jeff was saying,
[22:06.020 --> 22:10.180]  it's a lot about the preservation, the preservation of clone only, or, you know,
[22:10.180 --> 22:13.780]  say even if it's your own hybrid and you run through a hundred seeds and you find that one
[22:13.780 --> 22:17.620]  perfect female, that super female, you know, that, that, that right there, that's perfect,
[22:17.620 --> 22:20.980]  perfect example of why you should feminize it straight and stabilize it right out the gate.
[22:21.540 --> 22:24.980]  And that's what we've done with our space dragon. As a matter of fact, it's just to S1 it,
[22:24.980 --> 22:29.300]  give everybody the same version that we've grown to love for seven to eight years, you know? And
[22:29.300 --> 22:33.460]  the only way to really do that truly is to not outcross it is to feminize it. Yeah.
[22:34.020 --> 22:37.460]  And it's a lot more fun outcrossing it though, isn't it? It is because of the variety,
[22:37.460 --> 22:40.260]  like you were saying, the diversity of genetics to define what watch nature,
[22:40.260 --> 22:44.180]  take over the natural selection and just watch, you know, just, just watch it take hold and really
[22:44.740 --> 22:48.020]  do what nature does, you know, do what nature does. I want to give a huge shout out talking
[22:48.020 --> 22:54.100]  about doing what nature does. Gage green genetics is an F1 monster putting out the F1, the show and
[22:54.100 --> 22:58.020]  diversity. If you guys know what that means, you'll give them a shout out for that too. If
[22:58.020 --> 23:02.900]  you don't understand that you'll catch up as you listen to the show and gauge puts out, I don't
[23:02.900 --> 23:08.580]  trust most F1s, but gauges F1s are amazing. I don't know what he does. He has something special
[23:08.580 --> 23:12.660]  going on. Key play in that crew. I don't know what names they want me to use, but shout out to key
[23:12.660 --> 23:19.380]  play and the entire screen. Mike. Yeah. We'll call Mike M four K M K four M K four. Yeah. That's the
[23:19.380 --> 23:23.780]  80 thing, but yeah. Shout out to that whole crew. Those guys do amazing work. I look up to them a
[23:23.780 --> 23:27.700]  lot. They don't realize I do too. I used to do a lot of test work for gauge green. I just got
[23:27.700 --> 23:31.300]  done running through some eight, like seven, eight year old beans of the original gravestomper
[23:31.300 --> 23:36.820]  release. Wow. And we found a sour balls, sour balls, you know, so we're so, we're so excited
[23:36.820 --> 23:40.260]  about this one. We're going to be doing a lot of work with it soon. Gauge and the Cali connection
[23:40.260 --> 23:45.460]  kind of put my brand on the map. They sent me free gear to run for them and let me take pictures.
[23:45.460 --> 23:49.460]  And then they published my pictures and high times and skunk mag and shit like that. Yeah.
[23:49.460 --> 23:54.100]  The guys have always seriously generous to everybody, you know, even the newcomers into
[23:54.100 --> 23:57.460]  the game, they'll even give you a chance, you know, and give you some seeds to get started.
[23:57.460 --> 24:02.420]  Showed me mad love. When, when we all met up at the cup, they swerve and the whole gauge crew,
[24:02.420 --> 24:06.500]  they all gave me mad, mad love. I spent most of my time at the Cali connection booth and the rest
[24:06.500 --> 24:11.380]  of my time at the gauge booth. Yeah. At the camp at the cup last year. So I remember what I was
[24:11.380 --> 24:18.660]  going to say about reversing plants. I took a strain that I, so I had a plant and I selfed it
[24:18.660 --> 24:23.780]  and made seeds out of that. And I kept the original mommy. And then I took seeds and grew
[24:23.780 --> 24:28.980]  the seeds until I found one that looked just like mommy. And then I reversed mommy again and put
[24:28.980 --> 24:34.260]  that pollen on this female. And I can't get that offspring to reverse. I found a beautiful female
[24:34.260 --> 24:41.220]  that is amazing. She's been labeled GD 77 and she can't, I cannot reverse her with undiluted
[24:41.220 --> 24:46.340]  colloidal silver or not colloidal silver, silver thiosulfate a hundred percent just push. And she
[24:46.340 --> 24:51.780]  just looked at me like, Nope, that's great, man. That's, that's a really true keeper there. That's
[24:51.940 --> 24:55.380]  the true breeding. But I kind of hosed myself because that's one of my breeders and I was
[24:55.380 --> 24:59.460]  hoping to be able to still reverse that. So I had to go backwards. I had to go back to the other
[24:59.460 --> 25:05.380]  clone. Yeah. But yeah, that is definitely, I'm, I was told I'm one of the only breeders that's
[25:05.380 --> 25:11.620]  doing solid stress tests on my seeds. When I, before I'll breed with a female, I'll take,
[25:11.620 --> 25:15.060]  like say I'm going to breed with blue dream. You know, I would take blue dream and put her in a,
[25:15.060 --> 25:20.020]  in a room by herself or with whatever else I'm testing and run the light cycle for two weeks,
[25:20.020 --> 25:25.300]  the way she should and flower and then disrupt it and like turn it to the opposite and see if I
[25:25.300 --> 25:30.580]  can make her herm. Yeah. And if you're mom, yeah, yeah. No, then I'll use those to breed. If they,
[25:30.580 --> 25:33.540]  if I really got to kick their ass to make them herm, then I'll use them. If they heard
[25:33.540 --> 25:37.380]  them too easily, I'll toss them. I won't even waste my time with it. Yeah. I don't, I don't
[25:37.380 --> 25:40.660]  want to put out more herm stuff. Totally makes sense. So here's something I've talked about a
[25:40.660 --> 25:43.700]  couple of times. I'm way off on my notes, but this is fun. I just like this random chatter.
[25:43.700 --> 25:47.780]  Maybe you guys will have an answer to this question. I reversed a golden goat plant
[25:47.780 --> 25:52.500]  and I took the pollen and I put it on four other plants and it made great stuff. One of the plants,
[25:52.500 --> 25:58.980]  the headband plant shriveled up and died when the pollen hit it. Like the pistols went new
[25:58.980 --> 26:04.180]  and it shriveled up and I went up, died the plant died. It died. I, the lights went off. The lights
[26:04.180 --> 26:10.020]  were going off. I pollinated right before sunset or lights out and just hit the pollen. I watched,
[26:10.020 --> 26:12.740]  hung out for a minute. You know, I was like, Oh, lights are going out. I'm out of here. I left the
[26:12.740 --> 26:16.500]  room. I came back the next day to see the next day. The plant was dead, bro. The other plants
[26:16.500 --> 26:19.940]  in the room were all, everybody was happy. Irie. Everyone's getting the same treatment,
[26:19.940 --> 26:25.060]  except that headband plant over in the corner. It was like, Nope, it wasn't you. I think I'm
[26:25.060 --> 26:30.020]  the only one that had access, bro. Like I don't, I don't, nobody touches my breeding shit. Yeah.
[26:30.820 --> 26:34.420]  Yeah. That was crazy. I've never, I've actually never seen that. I can't say that's one of the
[26:34.420 --> 26:38.020]  other breeders. Everyone looked at me like, yeah, you did something really wrong. They're like,
[26:38.020 --> 26:44.420]  you fed that plant battery. Yeah. Something, but yeah. I wondered if maybe anybody has seen that.
[26:44.820 --> 26:50.020]  No, it's crazy. Rob's looking at me like, Holy shit, dude. Well, I'm trying it again. So in that
[26:50.020 --> 26:54.820]  room behind us, there's, there's a golden, a reversed golden goat in that room in there with
[26:56.260 --> 27:00.580]  killed the headband. Yeah. So I got headband and Gorilla glue. Uh, just hate each other. There's
[27:00.580 --> 27:04.900]  a Kalonji cushion there and then a lemon skunk too. You can make some more, uh, lemon Jeffrey.
[27:04.900 --> 27:08.660]  And then there's a whole bunch of golden goats in there to make some golden goat seeds. Yeah,
[27:08.660 --> 27:12.340]  that's great. Everybody loves that lemon Jeffrey and golden goat guys. It's coming.
[27:12.340 --> 27:17.780]  The pollen is almost falling. It's almost there. Nice. It's almost dropping. He's almost,
[27:17.780 --> 27:22.420]  what's that lemon. What's that lemon cut the lemon skunk. It's a, from Arians greenhouse seeds.
[27:24.020 --> 27:28.100]  Just one of his, one of his fem packs a long time ago. I just bought us a gift. I said,
[27:28.100 --> 27:32.020]  I love lemon turps and somebody bought me that pack. So I had to run it, dude. I got the, uh,
[27:32.020 --> 27:36.500]  the biggest cut of that man. It's supposed to be like 30 years old. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[27:38.500 --> 27:40.660]  Dude. We'll trade some cuts. This whole table, we'll get together and
[27:42.500 --> 27:45.380]  yeah, that's what I feel. It's really all about, man. It's too much of a shark tank
[27:45.380 --> 27:48.820]  out there nowadays. And you know, a lot of us that's been doing this a long time.
[27:48.820 --> 27:52.580]  It's a lot of us started out underground. We really need to stick together and keep
[27:52.580 --> 27:55.860]  to those circles, you know, and help each other out. And then it makes less of a shark tank and
[27:55.860 --> 28:00.100]  more happy environment for everybody. Happy. I feel like a cheater being a Colorado breeder.
[28:00.100 --> 28:03.860]  Like, cause I, I got to cheat. You guys had to hide and do that shit. Like, yeah,
[28:03.860 --> 28:07.060]  but you couldn't even go to the hydro store. That's exactly right. We follow you home from
[28:07.060 --> 28:11.700]  the actually that's how my mother got busted. They actually said they slid across the street
[28:11.860 --> 28:15.140]  in the East coast and they, uh, they run your tags and then that's all they need.
[28:15.140 --> 28:18.180]  They need that number and they can get everything. Yeah. Yeah. And then come back
[28:18.180 --> 28:22.020]  on your phone, your name, address, what kind of insurance you have. So guys look out for that.
[28:22.020 --> 28:26.180]  You're on the East coast listening. Yeah. Yeah. Be careful. Don't go to the hydro store. Just move,
[28:26.180 --> 28:30.820]  just move or legalize it where you are because the States that have legal cannabis are getting
[28:30.820 --> 28:35.220]  full and prices are going up. Everybody's rents going up everywhere now in Colorado. So yeah,
[28:35.220 --> 28:38.340]  yeah. Just legalize it where you are so that that way you don't have to move here and pay
[28:38.340 --> 28:44.580]  1200 bucks for a small apartment. That's what's happening. All right. So I'm going to ask the
[28:44.580 --> 28:49.620]  quick, the crazy question now, how do you guys feel about auto flowering seeds? Oh, it sucks.
[28:50.180 --> 28:57.700]  I love you already. Me. I, I, I really don't, I really don't care for particularly. I really
[28:57.700 --> 29:02.020]  don't like to grow them myself. I have grown plenty of them. I understand the breeding process
[29:02.020 --> 29:07.780]  of them. I have been asked to grow them and breed them, but I feel a true auto auto flower needs to
[29:07.780 --> 29:14.580]  be 80, 90 days to 120 days from start to finish and not these 60 day, 30 day, whatever they're
[29:14.580 --> 29:19.780]  trying to push on the market right now. There's no way for plant to get properly mature to give
[29:19.780 --> 29:25.060]  you really anything worth a dime at the end of it or worth its weight and the effort that you put
[29:25.060 --> 29:29.540]  into that plant. When you can do the same thing, I have grown regular seeds, 12 and 12 from seed
[29:29.540 --> 29:34.660]  and got ounces off of them before. And that's, that's, that's faster than 90 days. It's faster
[29:34.660 --> 29:37.780]  than what an auto flower can give it to you. And you're going to not, you're not going to suffer
[29:37.780 --> 29:44.740]  your potency now for cash croppers and things like that. That's, that's probably where they're
[29:44.740 --> 29:50.500]  probably most appealing getting multiple crops or they do. I feel they do have a little bit of a
[29:50.500 --> 29:54.980]  place in like stealth place, like Florida places like that. You could do small grows, small little
[29:54.980 --> 30:01.940]  plants and do a bunch of them do feminized, you know, yeah. Yeah. And stay under the radar very
[30:02.020 --> 30:06.820]  well outdoors. There was a huge, a cartel that got busted in a national forest around here,
[30:06.820 --> 30:11.460]  running a bunch of auto flower. Exactly. In my opinion, that's where they originally started
[30:11.460 --> 30:15.460]  from auto. They wrote about waste time, just flower, you know, so they could just line them
[30:15.460 --> 30:20.740]  up. They did a plot of like 50 feet by 50 feet here and then wait three weeks and get another
[30:20.740 --> 30:25.300]  plot. Absolutely. And then there's a lot of things to go around online and on the internet and
[30:25.300 --> 30:29.060]  different hearsay about where auto flowers originally came from, whether it came from
[30:29.060 --> 30:32.340]  low rider, this, that, and the other. And that's really, truly where it came from. Jeff was the
[30:32.340 --> 30:37.140]  Mexican drug cartels and they learned how to, they started breeding their own cannabis with
[30:37.140 --> 30:42.020]  Kansas city ditch weed, basically hemp. Yeah. Rooter Alice. Rooter Alice to get us to flower
[30:42.020 --> 30:45.620]  automatic, automatic. Absolutely. And they figured out they could get three seasons a year in the
[30:45.620 --> 30:51.460]  same time and push it out. And that's why the swag just became even more swag year. And to this day,
[30:51.460 --> 30:55.860]  though, what we're seeing is a good thing. You know, we were seeing the push of that away.
[30:56.820 --> 31:00.420]  They're not even selling any weed anymore to America. The Mexican is not even worth a dime
[31:00.420 --> 31:05.540]  coming over the border. It's exactly the opposite of what the government said would happen. Yeah.
[31:05.540 --> 31:09.540]  Yeah. Uh, they're actually, but it pissed them off. I hear that they're doing other things to
[31:09.540 --> 31:13.620]  like try to make more money and get back at us now because they're mad. But of course that's how
[31:13.620 --> 31:18.580]  they're going to roll. Right. They're stealing lines. I don't know. As far as indoors growing
[31:18.580 --> 31:23.460]  autos indoors, I mean, you're saving two weeks, better at beds, you know? Yeah. Right. Really?
[31:23.780 --> 31:27.300]  Yeah. Learn, learn to canopy management. Like we've talked about on the show,
[31:27.300 --> 31:31.700]  but then you'll get that same weight or better phenotype selection. Absolutely. Yeah. And you
[31:31.700 --> 31:35.220]  can't clone your auto flowers. What if you find that, what if you find that amazing? You're like,
[31:35.220 --> 31:39.540]  Oh, that was fun. Total waste. That's exactly what it is. The few times I've had really great
[31:39.540 --> 31:44.420]  auto flowers and good experiences with auto flowers. It was, it was, it was, you know,
[31:44.420 --> 31:48.820]  it was great. Now what do I do? Yeah. Yeah. Like that was fun. Pop real seeds. Exactly.
[31:49.220 --> 31:54.340]  Pop real seeds. There you go. It was like, you know, that great sex for one night and then.
[31:54.340 --> 31:56.980]  I was going to say that, but I wasn't going to compare it to that. I'm glad I let someone else
[31:56.980 --> 32:01.940]  use that analogy. It's like, there's like knowing that amazing girl. We were all thinking it. Yeah.
[32:03.940 --> 32:07.380]  I want to give you guys a shout out. You brought me, Rob brought me a dab shirt.
[32:07.380 --> 32:10.100]  I'm looking across the table and the two gentlemen, gentlemen joining me, have this
[32:10.100 --> 32:14.580]  dab shirt. The logo looks sweet. It makes me want to take a dab. Every time I see that logo.
[32:14.580 --> 32:17.620]  It's awesome, man. I'll be rocking it one day at the cannabis cup. I appreciate it.
[32:17.780 --> 32:21.860]  A long cannabis cup coming up for sure. Absolutely. It really means a lot to me to
[32:21.860 --> 32:24.900]  have my artwork out there like that, man. And that people like it and enjoy it, man.
[32:24.900 --> 32:27.700]  That's that's a really means a lot to me. There's something I agree with you when you
[32:27.700 --> 32:30.980]  walk through the cannabis cup and someone's wearing your logo and you don't even know,
[32:30.980 --> 32:34.980]  I just took a big fat puff off it. I'm holding it. When they're wearing your logo and they high
[32:34.980 --> 32:37.940]  five you and they're excited to see you. And you're like, I just made a friend. It's,
[32:37.940 --> 32:41.220]  it's a really great experience. Yeah. I look forward to meeting you guys at the cannabis cup.
[32:41.220 --> 32:44.500]  People walk up. If you, if you know me, if you listen to the show, walk up, high five me.
[32:45.460 --> 32:50.100]  I've got some platinum OG dabs. I've got some black cherry chem dabs and I have some Jeff's OG
[32:50.100 --> 32:53.860]  dabs and I'm taking to the cup with me. If you find me at the right time, if I'm not out, I'll
[32:53.860 --> 32:58.740]  dab you out. Chances are, I won't have any seeds with me. There's a private party Friday night and
[32:58.740 --> 33:03.540]  they're going to be gone before I even leave that party. Sorry y'all. But that's what we do.
[33:04.420 --> 33:10.820]  So you guys, you're both from different States. You grew in other States where it was crazy. And
[33:10.820 --> 33:15.380]  now you came here and you're able to set up shop and grow and do your breeding thing. And I know
[33:15.380 --> 33:19.540]  that's a lot less stressful. The breeding laws here, it's kind of gray area in the breeding,
[33:19.540 --> 33:24.020]  but they keep changing the rules everywhere we move to grow. They keep changing the rules. Is
[33:24.020 --> 33:29.220]  that messing you guys up? Not at all. No, I'm from Virginia. So no matter what happens here,
[33:30.100 --> 33:36.260]  I'm good. I think, I think, I think what it really boils down to when it, like he's saying,
[33:36.260 --> 33:39.540]  you know, when you're a true grower, nothing's going to stop you doing what you love. Yeah.
[33:39.860 --> 33:44.980]  Well, I totally agree with that. Totally agree with that. And I think that not just cannabis or
[33:44.980 --> 33:48.820]  growing it, I think it goes for all levels. If something that you really love to do, regardless
[33:48.820 --> 33:51.940]  of the, who's the government to tell you that you can't, cannot do nothing. I could, I could never
[33:51.940 --> 33:59.140]  stop it, but it's, it's, it's really not going to affect me. I'm I'm I'm I'm in the County,
[33:59.140 --> 34:02.820]  things like that. So I really don't have to worry about the new, but the ordinance is now with the,
[34:03.700 --> 34:09.380]  you know, like Pueblo, no more outdoor growing city limits. Yeah. You can't grow outdoors
[34:09.380 --> 34:13.700]  in our city limits at all. Yeah. That was killed by a couple of specific growers because they had
[34:13.700 --> 34:18.180]  the dank outside and they just had six foot tall plants over the fence that smelled all the way
[34:18.180 --> 34:22.340]  down to the high school down the street. So that pissed off kind of a few people. That sucks.
[34:22.340 --> 34:26.980]  There's a question I've never asked anybody on the show. If you had to pick one, either growing
[34:26.980 --> 34:35.060]  or smoking cannabis growing, grow. See, I agree. I agree. That's so awesome. I'm glad that that
[34:35.060 --> 34:39.780]  means we're all in this right thing. We're all in it with our hearts. I love that you guys didn't
[34:39.780 --> 34:44.340]  even have to think about it. Absolutely not. That is so cool. If even if I couldn't smoke
[34:44.340 --> 34:48.100]  cannabis and my lungs gave out tomorrow or somewhere, some crazy reason that I couldn't
[34:48.100 --> 34:52.580]  smoke cannabis, it's still, it's not, it's a, it's a learning tool. It's it's, it's a fun
[34:52.580 --> 34:57.780]  experience. It's like Jeff, you usually play drums. Um, it's, it's that release that release
[34:57.780 --> 35:03.620]  that you get and it's your energy going into a good thing, you know, and you can help other people.
[35:03.700 --> 35:08.740]  Exactly. I can be in the worst mood and I don't usually get in a bad mood, but yeah,
[35:08.740 --> 35:12.980]  yeah. A bad day in the garden is better than a good day at most other things. You know,
[35:12.980 --> 35:16.660]  I can just go in the garden and just, there's always something to do. And you just go in there
[35:16.660 --> 35:21.540]  and next thing you know, it's been 30 or 40 minutes and you're more, you're just, yeah.
[35:22.100 --> 35:26.020]  You just want to hang out. You got some, you got a podcast on, hopefully you're listening to the
[35:26.020 --> 35:29.460]  grow from your heart podcast or some good reggae music. And you're just in there taking off the
[35:29.460 --> 35:36.500]  dead leaves or just tilling the top soil or just staring. I catch myself just almost masturbating
[35:36.500 --> 35:41.460]  to the garden. Just like, Oh, I want to buy him drinks and throw dollars at him. I'm like,
[35:41.460 --> 35:48.180]  these ladies are so beautiful. Yeah. Guys, if, if you understand what I'm saying, you're listening
[35:48.180 --> 35:51.460]  to the right podcast. That's right. That's, that's what grown's all about. If you want to
[35:51.460 --> 35:56.100]  throw a dollar bills at your sexy clients, you're growing some sexy bitches. Stripper OG, I'm
[35:56.100 --> 36:03.780]  claiming the name right now. We're taking it. So we've been going about 36 minutes on that. I'm
[36:03.780 --> 36:07.460]  glad you approve. Thank you. Thank you. It was very excellent. It might've dried up a little
[36:07.460 --> 36:12.660]  more than I wanted, but awesome. Thank you. Cool. Cool. I appreciate that. If you guys approve,
[36:12.660 --> 36:18.020]  then that means it's good. Sure. Good shit. Absolutely. Where can someone find other than
[36:18.020 --> 36:23.620]  naturesgreenremedies.com and the cannabis cup this fall? Where can people find your seeds, man?
[36:24.420 --> 36:28.340]  Me, mine, mine, mine will just be there. The cannabis cup, uh, nature's green remedies and,
[36:28.340 --> 36:32.740]  uh, you'll find us at the seven 10 cup this year. Seven 10 cup in Colorado. I will be there.
[36:37.540 --> 36:41.300]  Will the seeds get to us if we order them from attitude right now? Yeah. Okay. There's a lot
[36:41.300 --> 36:44.900]  of speculation. So you heard right here. Seeds from them in a while, but you heard it right there,
[36:44.900 --> 36:48.820]  guys. Can of interest says you can get them from the to order them up. You got a coupon code or
[36:48.820 --> 36:53.380]  anything? I don't. I got a thing. I got a promo going on there though, man. Some free seeds.
[36:53.940 --> 36:58.580]  Right now we'll check it out. I think 80% on some triple Nova. This is going to go up like a week
[36:58.580 --> 37:03.940]  before the cannabis cup. I think this will be up April 13th ish. So people will hear it. Um, we're
[37:03.940 --> 37:06.980]  going to have, then we'll have a really cool cannabis cup episode. So I'm loading the webpage.
[37:06.980 --> 37:10.740]  We'll go to the attitude seed bank right now. I haven't gone here in a long time. Yeah. I haven't,
[37:11.300 --> 37:15.220]  you know, I think I got some free seeds on there too. Uh, we'll check it out. We'll give you a
[37:15.220 --> 37:18.980]  proper shout out on there. I could have done some pre-show research, but I don't even know.
[37:19.540 --> 37:25.860]  So these companies change so often that it's hard to tell. I don't keep track of sales. I don't keep
[37:25.860 --> 37:29.460]  tracking. I just send seeds. I take orders since he's, I don't, I don't, I don't even check.
[37:30.340 --> 37:34.740]  I play the, I don't know role. I don't know, man. Somehow seeds end up at nature's green remedies.
[37:35.700 --> 37:42.420]  They handle all that for me. I don't do sales. They do Bitcoin now. I'm not advertising so much
[37:42.420 --> 37:47.380]  for them. I heard attitude. Uh, I don't know, man. I heard they stopped doing credit cards,
[37:47.380 --> 37:53.060]  doing Bitcoin. Wow. Yeah. It looks like, wow. Yeah. Yeah. And then they show you how to get
[37:53.060 --> 37:56.740]  the Bitcoins too. So that maybe they're trying to change it, but, um, no, you do not have a
[37:56.740 --> 38:01.700]  promo this month. No, no, not on the front page, but still guys support that spot. Cause it's cool.
[38:01.700 --> 38:06.660]  As long as they, uh, as long as you pay for the fucking guaranteed shipping, that's it works.
[38:06.660 --> 38:11.940]  Yeah. Pay. That's what you have to do. Get a shirt out of it. Yeah. You get a cool, get a mug. I
[38:11.940 --> 38:15.620]  recommend getting a mug because they sent me a really cool DNA genetics mug and I passed that
[38:15.620 --> 38:21.300]  on as a Christmas gift. Awesome. Yeah. The shirts aren't as cool as the mugs. I got a Dr. Moon shirt.
[38:22.260 --> 38:25.940]  Some weird shit. Yeah. I got one with like some
[38:27.780 --> 38:32.340]  hell Betty looking chick right in the missile. It looked really obscene, but I just wrapped
[38:32.340 --> 38:37.300]  other stuff up in it and sent it on. So what's coming up in the future for, uh, for sour seeds,
[38:37.940 --> 38:43.380]  lots, lots, lots in the future. Uh, we plan to go, I say worldwide by the end of the year. Um,
[38:43.460 --> 38:46.580]  if, as long as we can keep up with the demand and really do well this year,
[38:46.580 --> 38:49.140]  we're going to do a big tour and we're going to have a lot of just, we're just going to go
[38:49.140 --> 38:52.740]  out there and have fun with it, man. And do what I do. Is there any plan to get your seeds on shelves
[38:52.740 --> 38:57.540]  in Colorado? Absolutely. Absolutely. That's, that's a big, big, big thing for us to, um,
[38:57.540 --> 39:01.860]  at the end of the year, we're actually going to go with our own medically infused products license.
[39:01.860 --> 39:06.420]  Um, I have 40 acres in Colorado city, a one agricultural. So we're going to go big. We're
[39:06.420 --> 39:10.900]  going to do it right. You know, and, uh, and, and it's just going to grow and grow from there. And,
[39:10.980 --> 39:16.100]  uh, we're also starting our own clothing company, uh, highlife apparel should be coming out soon.
[39:16.100 --> 39:20.100]  Um, the stuff looks good guys. They brought me a t-shirt and I love it. And, uh, yeah,
[39:20.100 --> 39:24.180]  thanks man. And, and, and, you know, it's just all custom done designs. Um, anyone's welcome
[39:24.180 --> 39:28.420]  to bring a design and, and if we can print it and you like it and other people like it,
[39:28.980 --> 39:32.820]  we'll print it. You know, that, that's what it's all about. It's like local artists. That's what
[39:32.820 --> 39:36.660]  I want to bring you to that whole scene as local design being worn at the cannabis cut by one of
[39:36.660 --> 39:40.020]  us. Yeah. That's so awesome. You know, and then, and that's, it's, it's a good feeling, man. It
[39:40.020 --> 39:43.780]  really is a good feeling to get your artwork out there and just, just to have it seen by others.
[39:43.780 --> 39:47.700]  And you never know, you could be the next greatest artist in the world. And you never know what
[39:47.700 --> 39:51.860]  tomorrow can hold for a person that just drives himself to do things. That's the truth. This guy
[39:51.860 --> 39:56.260]  speaks the truth. Y'all Mr. Canaventure what's coming up in the future, my friend, nothing,
[39:56.260 --> 40:00.660]  nothing. You guys just chilling, just done, done. You giving it up. Just going to keep smoking pot
[40:00.660 --> 40:09.380]  and see what happens. I love that. It's wearing a sweater and a cardigan, a cardigan. Yeah. I
[40:09.380 --> 40:12.740]  couldn't think of the property. You can tell he's been in the industry a lot longer than us. Yeah.
[40:12.740 --> 40:17.220]  Yeah. He's already comfortable. He's just like, I'm just gonna smoke pot. Let's take some dads.
[40:17.220 --> 40:20.660]  Let's see what those guys figured out. Yeah. I'm going to put some pollen on some plants,
[40:20.660 --> 40:31.140]  take some seeds out and send those to the attitude. Take another dab. Done. Nah, it's been cool, man.
[40:31.140 --> 40:34.980]  Guys, you see how that works? Just fucking let some shit go. Like that guy just did.
[40:34.980 --> 40:38.740]  Why can't we all do that? That's so easy, man. I could tell, I could tell we were going to have
[40:38.740 --> 40:43.780]  fun the minute you walked in. Oh yeah. Rusty's great character. I made a friend for life. So I
[40:43.780 --> 40:48.980]  see like a clone trading session and possibly a, I'm going to kind of say collab. Oh dude. You know,
[40:49.620 --> 40:52.660]  let's do something. Absolutely. Yeah. We've actually been talking about doing some collab
[40:52.660 --> 40:57.140]  and stuff like that. And uh, who's got, who's got the best mail, the best steady mail. Dude,
[40:57.140 --> 41:02.100]  I got a lot of shit. Yeah, I do. That's for sure. He's definitely got a lot. And I don't know my
[41:02.100 --> 41:07.380]  mail, my mail's pretty, I got some pretty good mails that I had that, that Kim D backcross mail
[41:07.380 --> 41:12.580]  and it does wonderful work. It's almost identical replica to the original Kim dog D. I mean, you look
[41:12.580 --> 41:16.340]  at them side by side and it's hard to tell which one is the male, which one's to female. I mean,
[41:16.340 --> 41:20.020]  in veg, you couldn't really tell between the two, but uh, we can do a lot of cool things with that.
[41:20.580 --> 41:24.100]  It, it, it's going to do a lot of great work. We have a new sour alien dog coming out and
[41:25.220 --> 41:33.060]  it's a basically an alien OG white fire and uh, that Kim dog D. So keep on the lookout guys.
[41:33.060 --> 41:36.180]  Sour seeds is coming up. They're going to be putting out some fire shit. It sounds like
[41:36.180 --> 41:41.140]  absolutely. Does that fix it? Yeah. See, I told you guys, I'm going to do another shout out on
[41:41.140 --> 41:45.860]  this piece of equipment. The live wire solutions, HAO four. It's a piece of shit. Don't ever buy
[41:45.860 --> 41:50.900]  one. That sound you heard was me smacking on it to make it work properly to bring Rusty's channel
[41:53.540 --> 41:57.380]  by the same people that brought you Nintendo. Is that, is it probably, I don't know. We can't
[41:57.380 --> 42:02.580]  say that. It's great. Right. All right. I'm going to start closing up the show. Uh, where can people
[42:02.580 --> 42:08.020]  find you online? Do you have like a website or something? Yeah, we do. A mile high dank.co mile
[42:08.020 --> 42:13.620]  high dank.co. Do you have an Instagram page right now? Yes. Our Cico sour seed co check them out
[42:13.620 --> 42:17.700]  there guys. Follow them on Instagram. How about a Twitter? Not Twitter yet. Twitter not on the
[42:17.700 --> 42:21.540]  Twitter. You have a forum on your website also, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Our whole web form that,
[42:21.540 --> 42:25.860]  that's basically what it is. It's just a straight up web form. Uh, you know, anybody's welcome to
[42:25.860 --> 42:30.260]  join growers, helping growers, you know, anybody we can, we can lend you a hand if you need it.
[42:30.260 --> 42:35.460]  And, uh, we look to see a lot of our own genetics and we have Ross to Jeff on there. We have a
[42:35.460 --> 42:39.540]  can of venture on there. So, you know, we just want to, we want to see our genetics online. We
[42:39.540 --> 42:43.620]  want to see what you get out of our genetics and how much you do. And how does that feel, man? When
[42:43.620 --> 42:48.260]  you just scroll through a website and see somebody killing it with your creations, that is, that's the
[42:48.260 --> 42:51.300]  greatest thing. It's just like another piece of artwork, you know, just it was anything else.
[42:51.300 --> 42:55.220]  It's all a work of art. Yeah. It makes you like a proud pop-up. Well, that's it. That's your trophy
[42:55.220 --> 42:58.500]  man. At the end of the day, you know, that's what, that's really what it's all about. I feel like the
[42:58.500 --> 43:02.340]  breeder should be able to grow the shit out of his creation. But when you send those seeds to just
[43:02.340 --> 43:05.300]  somebody else, somebody buys them, you don't even know who the hell they are. And they kill it.
[43:05.300 --> 43:09.460]  And you're like, Oh man, that means I did that strain. Right. And like you were saying about F1
[43:09.460 --> 43:13.300]  seeds, that's a lot of like what we do too, at the same time as with Gage Green and a lot of the other
[43:13.300 --> 43:19.060]  guys. Um, that's your chance to find a clone only. Nobody has. Yeah. That's your chance to find that
[43:19.060 --> 43:24.900]  gym, that Holy grail. Yep. Big shout out to Van Bear. Uh, he killed it with some of my Dubwise.
[43:24.900 --> 43:29.220]  I can't see the plant through the trichomes and it looks great. And he did it with LEDs.
[43:29.220 --> 43:33.460]  Oh wow. Yeah. Yeah. Which is actually impressive. A lot of people diss on the LEDs and he killed
[43:33.460 --> 43:36.900]  it with those. At least it looks like LEDs. All his pics are purple in the background. So I'm
[43:36.900 --> 43:42.180]  assuming it's LED. Yeah. It looks great. Yeah. Well he's on my forum. He's on, if you go to
[43:42.180 --> 43:46.900]  iREGIONXColorado.com, there's a forum and uh, I'll check out your guys's forum a little more often.
[43:46.900 --> 43:50.660]  And you guys go to mine and we'll all check out Van Bear's pictures. See the killer work he did.
[43:50.740 --> 43:55.380]  Awesome. Awesome. I'm working with a combination of LED and high pressure sodium. I really like it.
[43:55.380 --> 43:58.980]  That's, that's what I've been rolling with a little while now. And it does, it does work,
[43:58.980 --> 44:03.140]  man. It looks good. Well, would you rot smells good. We only took a couple of puffs because
[44:03.140 --> 44:08.420]  everybody got lit. Yeah, this was a, unfortunately this was, you know, seed, seed weed, but uh,
[44:10.660 --> 44:14.420]  do you guys feel like the, uh, seeded plants make a different kind of a cannabinoid spectrum?
[44:16.020 --> 44:20.500]  Absolutely. I feel that most of the plants full potential is going to make an offspring.
[44:20.500 --> 44:23.620]  Yeah. Whoever did that room, whoever set that room up, it's a high five. Yeah, man.
[44:24.980 --> 44:30.820]  Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. So I completely think that, uh, we make hash out of all the plants that I run
[44:30.820 --> 44:34.020]  that have seeds in them. We just pull the seeds out and make hash out of all of it because why
[44:34.020 --> 44:38.580]  not? Do you pull all the seeds out? Like all of them? Well, we just, the way we do it. Yeah. Yeah.
[44:38.580 --> 44:43.540]  Even though it mostly come out. Yeah. It tastes weird, man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that
[44:43.540 --> 44:48.660]  hash gets you higher. It gets you a different, it's like a full body high. You get the head high,
[44:48.660 --> 44:53.460]  the body high, the eye high, you get caught in mouth. It seems like all those cannabinoids are
[44:53.460 --> 44:57.300]  in there when you let the plant seed itself. I don't talk about that a lot. Look at my fingers.
[44:57.300 --> 45:00.900]  Yeah. What have you been doing, man? Plucking seeds. Oh, nice. Holy shit. He's all black
[45:00.900 --> 45:08.660]  fingered over here. Yeah. Yeah. I got rubber gloves, bro. If you want a couple of those.
[45:11.540 --> 45:15.700]  Speaking of the raw dog, do you guys have a website? Uh, yeah, actually it's being redesigned,
[45:15.700 --> 45:21.140]  but, uh, we got a forum sign up to that forum, uh, for free, uh, you know, weekly giveaways.
[45:21.140 --> 45:24.980]  Cool. Cool. Get some free shit. Yeah. Yeah. Cannabis is a little ahead of the game on us.
[45:25.460 --> 45:31.060]  Oh man. I wouldn't say that. I've been around a little longer. Yeah. Well, we're all hanging
[45:31.060 --> 45:33.780]  out now. We're going to collab dude. I can't wait. We're going to have some, for sure. We're
[45:33.780 --> 45:38.100]  going to use that Kim D mail. Then the two of us will throw in a few. Oh, that room looks sexy.
[45:38.100 --> 45:43.860]  What size spots? Sevens. Sevens. Sevens. It looks really good. I like that. My room is sad right
[45:43.860 --> 45:47.940]  now because my flowering room is totally empty. And cause that fucking female killed that
[45:47.940 --> 45:57.940]  motherfucker. Oh yeah. Murder. No, I just, I just chopped it. It's looking pretty good. It's
[45:57.940 --> 46:01.460]  hanging on. It's all upside down now. So it's anti-gravity weed. Pretty soon it'll be some
[46:01.460 --> 46:06.900]  great medicine. I'll have some Tora Bora. They'll heal a lot of people. It'll be great. Topsy turvy.
[46:06.900 --> 46:11.860]  All right. Just can't have an Instagram. Oh no, no, you don't seem like an Instagram.
[46:12.420 --> 46:18.020]  I got a Twitter account that I can't even tell you what it is. Well, somebody out there will find it.
[46:18.020 --> 46:22.020]  Somebody listening will tweet at you and they'll be like, here it is. That's pretty bad. You're
[46:22.020 --> 46:27.060]  going to go trip, trip. Oh, that's my Twitter account. I guess what's getting bad when you
[46:27.060 --> 46:31.380]  can Google your own name and that's in you. You got like 1 bajillion hits, you know, it's just
[46:31.380 --> 46:35.860]  different things pop up. Yeah. I try not to look too much at that. Nah, definitely. I was going
[46:35.860 --> 46:39.060]  to tell these guys toward the end of the show, how many people listen to this podcast? Do either
[46:39.060 --> 46:45.620]  of you have a guess how many people hear my little show? I really don't. I listen to your show.

[47:11.620 --> 47:15.780]  man? So you can hear that. Doesn't it sound a lot better? It does. It sounds so pro dude.
[47:15.780 --> 47:18.900]  It does. Yeah. For sure. All right. I love bullshitting with these guys, but I should wrap
[47:18.900 --> 47:23.140]  it up. You guys only tend to listen to about 45 minutes and we're at 47. So let's do this.

[49:07.620 --> 49:12.100]  I honestly got a contribution with no name, so I don't even know who to say thank you to. So thank
[49:12.100 --> 49:16.980]  you to the anonymous donor. That is really cool. I appreciate that. We were getting donations on
[49:16.980 --> 49:21.860]  the donation page. Yeah, that's pretty much what I've got to say for today. I want to say a big,
[49:21.860 --> 49:25.060]  huge shout out to these guys for coming. They took time. They're breeders and growers. He's
[49:25.060 --> 49:30.580]  obviously plucking seeds. His fingers are black as shit. You guys had to take time out of real
[49:30.580 --> 49:34.020]  work to come over here and help me out. I appreciate it. You guys are welcome back anytime.
[49:34.020 --> 49:37.220]  Thank you, brother. Hey, if you're out there and you're a grower in Colorado, or if you've got
[49:37.220 --> 49:40.580]  something to say about cannabis and you want to be on a show, send me an email because somebody
[49:40.580 --> 49:43.780]  told me they wanted to be on the show and they're like, would you even have me? Fuck yeah, I'd have
[49:43.780 --> 49:47.780]  you, dude. I want to know what you have to say. There may be a pre-interview before I bring you
[49:47.780 --> 49:51.620]  to my recording area to dab you out. Might meet you at the Walmart or some shit.
[49:56.580 --> 50:00.020]  If you're not a fed and psychotic, there's a pretty good chance that you can come be on the
[50:00.020 --> 50:06.500]  show. Send me an email. Text me if you know how to do that. Whatever. I want to give a huge,
[50:06.500 --> 50:09.380]  huge shout out to my ninja spits. Thanks again for listening. Until next time,
[50:09.380 --> 50:12.740]  take a fat dad and give your mom a hug for me.
