[00:16.830 --> 00:19.310]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:19.310 --> 00:21.230]  It's time for episode number 199
[00:21.230 --> 00:22.950]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:22.950 --> 00:26.910]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:26.910 --> 00:28.030]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:28.030 --> 00:29.110]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.110 --> 00:31.430]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:31.430 --> 00:32.790]  if you're a cannabis activist
[00:32.790 --> 00:34.230]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:34.230 --> 00:36.070]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.070 --> 00:38.270]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:39.350 --> 00:41.230]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:41.230 --> 00:43.030]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:43.030 --> 00:45.150]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out
[00:45.150 --> 00:46.710]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:46.750 --> 00:48.910]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:48.910 --> 00:50.550]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot,
[00:50.550 --> 00:52.670]  and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.830 --> 00:57.550]  Ladies and gentlemen, today was the day
[00:57.550 --> 01:00.030]  after the Dude Grows Cup,
[01:00.030 --> 01:01.750]  and I'm sure you can hear it in my voice.
[01:01.750 --> 01:06.390]  I smoked a shit ton, a metric shit ton of dabs last night.
[01:06.390 --> 01:07.550]  Smoked a bunch of good flowers,
[01:07.550 --> 01:08.910]  smoked a bunch of good chatter,
[01:08.910 --> 01:11.350]  met a whole bunch of great people.
[01:11.350 --> 01:12.430]  Shout out to everybody I hung out with
[01:12.430 --> 01:13.630]  at the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:13.630 --> 01:15.710]  Also, a super huge shout out to the Dude
[01:15.790 --> 01:18.030]  and Scotty Real and Miss Real
[01:18.030 --> 01:19.470]  and everybody that took good care of us
[01:19.470 --> 01:20.390]  at the Dude Grows Cup.
[01:20.390 --> 01:21.470]  So I'm sure you've heard me talk about it
[01:21.470 --> 01:22.470]  a little bit, you guys.
[01:22.470 --> 01:23.550]  I'm gonna turn this music down a little bit
[01:23.550 --> 01:24.510]  and we'll get into the show.
[01:24.510 --> 01:25.590]  So there's another podcast.
[01:25.590 --> 01:26.990]  What's up, guys, at the Dude Grows Show?
[01:26.990 --> 01:29.470]  There's another podcast called the Dude Grows Show.
[01:29.470 --> 01:32.070]  Super good podcast hosted by the dude,
[01:32.070 --> 01:34.630]  accompanied by a dude that calls himself Scotty Real.
[01:34.630 --> 01:35.550]  Both really cool guys.
[01:35.550 --> 01:37.310]  I got to hang out with them last night.
[01:37.310 --> 01:38.470]  Spent a little bit of time with Scotty.
[01:38.470 --> 01:39.590]  Got to take a super cool photo.
[01:39.590 --> 01:41.870]  I hope that photo turned out well.
[01:41.870 --> 01:43.030]  But they threw a cup.
[01:43.030 --> 01:45.550]  They threw a cannabis judging event.
[01:46.390 --> 01:47.230]  I can't call it a cannabis cup
[01:47.230 --> 01:48.050]  because that word is already taken,
[01:48.050 --> 01:50.510]  but they threw an event where people were,
[01:50.510 --> 01:52.630]  they entered their flowers and their extracts
[01:52.630 --> 01:53.910]  and people got to judge them.
[01:53.910 --> 01:55.990]  We'll talk about the judging process in just a minute.
[01:55.990 --> 01:57.110]  But they threw a really cool event.
[01:57.110 --> 01:58.030]  It was super successful.
[01:58.030 --> 01:59.790]  There were quite a few people there.
[01:59.790 --> 02:01.670]  The event was at Cultivated Synergy.
[02:01.670 --> 02:03.470]  The place was, it wasn't crowded,
[02:03.470 --> 02:05.150]  but it was comfortably packed.
[02:05.150 --> 02:06.630]  There was just enough people there
[02:06.630 --> 02:08.750]  to make it a good party and it wasn't too overwhelmed
[02:08.750 --> 02:09.850]  where you're bumping into everybody.
[02:09.850 --> 02:11.350]  There's plenty of seating, plenty of tables
[02:11.350 --> 02:13.030]  for us to chill and take dabs.
[02:13.030 --> 02:13.870]  Great place.
[02:13.870 --> 02:15.150]  So they threw a huge event.
[02:15.750 --> 02:16.670]  They threw a cool ass party.
[02:16.670 --> 02:18.550]  I got to taste some of the entries.
[02:18.550 --> 02:20.110]  I got to taste some of the samples.
[02:20.110 --> 02:22.470]  I get to meet a whole bunch of cool people.
[02:22.470 --> 02:23.870]  Mike and Lindsey were supposed to come.
[02:23.870 --> 02:25.710]  The Dabbing Granny was supposed to come.
[02:25.710 --> 02:27.630]  Bobo Blaster Co was supposed to come,
[02:27.630 --> 02:29.350]  but some shit happened.
[02:29.350 --> 02:31.070]  Mike was gonna ride with me,
[02:31.070 --> 02:32.950]  but yesterday afternoon he sent me a message.
[02:32.950 --> 02:34.950]  He's like, hey bro, I don't feel super good.
[02:34.950 --> 02:36.270]  I think my kid got me sick.
[02:36.270 --> 02:37.110]  And I was like, you know what?
[02:37.110 --> 02:38.550]  If you think you're sick,
[02:38.550 --> 02:39.790]  don't even go to an event like that
[02:39.790 --> 02:41.070]  because we're all gonna be smoking together
[02:41.070 --> 02:42.910]  and I don't wanna get sick from you hitting my rig
[02:42.910 --> 02:44.710]  and I don't think we should go get everybody else sick.
[02:45.230 --> 02:47.230]  So Mike decided to stay home.
[02:47.230 --> 02:49.350]  Lindsey the Traveling Stoner and Bobo Blaster Co
[02:49.350 --> 02:50.990]  and the Dabbing Granny all cruised up,
[02:50.990 --> 02:53.230]  but when they got to the door,
[02:53.230 --> 02:55.670]  one of them, I will not single anybody out,
[02:55.670 --> 02:57.110]  but one of those dudes,
[02:57.110 --> 02:59.350]  the dude in that group that forgot his ID,
[02:59.350 --> 03:01.070]  forgot his ID and kind of hosed everyone
[03:01.070 --> 03:02.830]  so nobody else went in
[03:02.830 --> 03:05.710]  since one person did not have his ID.
[03:05.710 --> 03:07.430]  So I gave all them a hug
[03:07.430 --> 03:08.710]  and they turned around and drove,
[03:08.710 --> 03:09.630]  I don't know where they even went.
[03:09.630 --> 03:11.230]  I assume they went back to Springs or Pueblo,
[03:11.230 --> 03:13.150]  but they left the event and took off.
[03:13.150 --> 03:14.070]  They didn't even get to get in.
[03:14.110 --> 03:16.110]  I apologize guys, that sucks.
[03:16.110 --> 03:17.070]  It was a good time.
[03:17.070 --> 03:18.190]  It would have been even more fun with you there
[03:18.190 --> 03:19.930]  because a lot of podcast listeners were there
[03:19.930 --> 03:21.790]  and they were asking for you guys.
[03:21.790 --> 03:23.790]  Also in attendance,
[03:23.790 --> 03:25.950]  Jesse Grose showed up at the Dude Grose Cup
[03:25.950 --> 03:27.830]  with the legendary 44.
[03:27.830 --> 03:30.470]  I got to hang out with Jesse Grose and 44.
[03:30.470 --> 03:32.190]  That was a great ass time.
[03:32.190 --> 03:34.750]  And then I met a whole bunch of cool ass people.
[03:34.750 --> 03:37.590]  You guys, I parked my car directly across the street
[03:37.590 --> 03:39.710]  from Cultivated Synergy and I got out of the car
[03:39.710 --> 03:40.950]  and I wasn't 10 feet from the car
[03:40.950 --> 03:41.790]  before people started yelling,
[03:41.830 --> 03:44.870]  yo, it's Ross to Jeff, yo, take a fat dab.
[03:44.870 --> 03:45.950]  Just as soon as I got out of the car.
[03:45.950 --> 03:48.790]  So I walked toward the line, a couple of people greeted me.
[03:48.790 --> 03:51.030]  I got to the end of the line
[03:51.030 --> 03:52.230]  and as I was getting in line,
[03:52.230 --> 03:53.750]  a dude named Tony was like, what's up bro?
[03:53.750 --> 03:54.670]  I'm Tony from New Mexico.
[03:54.670 --> 03:56.750]  I listened to the podcast and I was like, fuck yeah.
[03:56.750 --> 03:58.230]  I started talking to Tony.
[03:58.230 --> 03:59.910]  Another guy and his girlfriend came up
[03:59.910 --> 04:00.750]  and started talking to me,
[04:00.750 --> 04:02.710]  but honestly I had so much ADD.
[04:02.710 --> 04:03.750]  I talked to them briefly
[04:03.750 --> 04:06.150]  and got sucked into Tony's conversation.
[04:06.150 --> 04:08.110]  Tony and his friend, I think his friend's buddy,
[04:08.110 --> 04:10.630]  his buddy's name was Paul is what I'm thinking.
[04:10.630 --> 04:11.470]  That's what I remember.
[04:12.150 --> 04:12.990]  Paul, I see your face in my head, dude,
[04:12.990 --> 04:14.630]  but Tony and Paul were cool.
[04:14.630 --> 04:16.110]  They're from New Mexico.
[04:16.110 --> 04:19.510]  They actually have picked up the Arise clone
[04:19.510 --> 04:21.070]  that is available at Organica.
[04:21.070 --> 04:25.070]  So they've got the 35% tested THC clone from Organica.
[04:25.070 --> 04:27.030]  They're growing it out there in New Mexico.
[04:27.030 --> 04:29.070]  So shout out to my new friends that I made from New Mexico.
[04:29.070 --> 04:32.010]  Also shout out to my friends that I made from Kansas City.
[04:32.010 --> 04:33.390]  I can't say your guys' names.
[04:33.390 --> 04:35.310]  I respect your privacy that much.
[04:35.310 --> 04:36.470]  I made some really cool new friends
[04:36.470 --> 04:38.830]  that listened to the podcast from Kansas City.
[04:38.830 --> 04:41.110]  A pair of brothers, cool ass dudes.
[04:41.750 --> 04:42.590]  It was great chatting with you guys.
[04:42.590 --> 04:43.550]  I hope you learned a lot from me.
[04:43.550 --> 04:45.070]  It was definitely great hearing
[04:45.070 --> 04:45.910]  how much you listened to the show
[04:45.910 --> 04:48.270]  and how much you have learned from listening to the show.
[04:48.270 --> 04:49.910]  I also made some friends from California.
[04:49.910 --> 04:51.390]  I don't know if you guys want me to say your names,
[04:51.390 --> 04:53.190]  but there are three dudes from California,
[04:53.190 --> 04:55.430]  two dudes from Cali, one guy was from Colorado.
[04:55.430 --> 04:56.350]  Those guys were super cool.
[04:56.350 --> 04:58.270]  Got to hang out with them for a few minutes.
[04:58.270 --> 05:00.430]  Also, there was a couple from Denver that I met
[05:00.430 --> 05:02.110]  that was super fun to hang out with.
[05:02.110 --> 05:03.890]  And then I met a guy.
[05:03.890 --> 05:06.950]  So I met a guy, I don't remember if he said Iowa or Idaho,
[05:06.950 --> 05:10.590]  but either way, he said that by listening to my podcast,
[05:11.110 --> 05:12.630]  he was able to learn how to grow
[05:12.630 --> 05:14.690]  and build a grow and fund a grow
[05:14.690 --> 05:17.310]  and fund his move to Colorado.
[05:17.310 --> 05:20.110]  And now he is employed by one of the leading dispensaries
[05:20.110 --> 05:20.950]  in Denver.
[05:20.950 --> 05:22.430]  And he got to give me a fist bump last night
[05:22.430 --> 05:23.870]  and tell me, thank you for that.
[05:23.870 --> 05:27.550]  That type of stuff means the world to me, you guys.
[05:27.550 --> 05:29.070]  All these people coming up to me and telling me,
[05:29.070 --> 05:30.830]  hey, you taught me how to grow.
[05:30.830 --> 05:31.910]  You got me through this.
[05:31.910 --> 05:33.590]  You made my garden so much better.
[05:33.590 --> 05:34.770]  That shit blew my mind.
[05:34.770 --> 05:37.770]  I had the biggest smile inside and outside all night.
[05:37.770 --> 05:38.770]  I was hard to hide.
[05:38.770 --> 05:40.510]  I was just cheesing out.
[05:41.310 --> 05:42.430]  Big shout out to all the cool people that I got to meet,
[05:42.430 --> 05:44.190]  all the people that were giving me love
[05:44.190 --> 05:45.270]  for what I do for the podcast.
[05:45.270 --> 05:46.710]  It makes it all worth it, you guys.
[05:46.710 --> 05:48.790]  I made a joke about how,
[05:48.790 --> 05:50.990]  if anybody ever has any questions, let me know,
[05:50.990 --> 05:53.950]  because I know that if you send me a question
[05:53.950 --> 05:54.830]  and I'm answering your question,
[05:54.830 --> 05:56.470]  I know I'm not just talking to myself.
[05:56.470 --> 05:58.110]  And somebody, I think it was from Texas,
[05:58.110 --> 05:59.910]  he goes, man, you're not talking to yourself.
[05:59.910 --> 06:01.730]  So that guy, if you remember who you are,
[06:01.730 --> 06:02.570]  I know who you are, bro.
[06:02.570 --> 06:04.310]  You're wearing a San Antonio Spurs hat.
[06:04.310 --> 06:05.130]  Shout out to you.
[06:05.130 --> 06:05.970]  Thanks for letting me know
[06:05.970 --> 06:07.310]  that I'm not talking to myself out here.
[06:07.310 --> 06:08.350]  It was super awesome.
[06:08.350 --> 06:09.630]  The greatest part was, you guys,
[06:09.630 --> 06:12.230]  this event had nothing to do with my podcast.
[06:12.230 --> 06:13.750]  This was the Dude Grows Cup,
[06:13.750 --> 06:15.330]  but they have given me several shout outs.
[06:15.330 --> 06:17.230]  I have given them several shout outs,
[06:17.230 --> 06:18.670]  and people knew that I was coming,
[06:18.670 --> 06:20.410]  and so they were excited to see me.
[06:20.410 --> 06:21.550]  At the Dude Grows Cup,
[06:21.550 --> 06:23.670]  I had a little Grow From Your Heart section hanging out.
[06:23.670 --> 06:24.510]  It was super cool.
[06:24.510 --> 06:26.750]  So big shout out, much love, much respect,
[06:26.750 --> 06:29.550]  much thanks to Scotty and the Dude from the Dude Grows Cup,
[06:29.550 --> 06:31.670]  and especially all the people that came and said,
[06:31.670 --> 06:32.510]  what's up to me?
[06:32.510 --> 06:33.950]  That meant a lot to me.
[06:33.950 --> 06:34.910]  I feel like I'm rambling about that,
[06:34.910 --> 06:36.110]  but it really meant a lot, you guys.
[06:36.110 --> 06:37.990]  It's huge when people give you praise
[06:37.990 --> 06:39.430]  for the work that you do in person.
[06:40.190 --> 06:41.430]  When you get to meet a large group of people,
[06:41.430 --> 06:43.550]  and they're thanking you for what you do, it means a lot.
[06:43.550 --> 06:44.910]  Especially people that you know
[06:44.910 --> 06:46.830]  are already able to grow without your guidance.
[06:46.830 --> 06:48.550]  Like, dude, you pushed me to the next level.
[06:48.550 --> 06:49.390]  That means a lot.
[06:50.230 --> 06:51.390]  So like I said, it was an event,
[06:51.390 --> 06:52.710]  and we were going to talk a little bit
[06:52.710 --> 06:53.750]  about judging the event.
[06:53.750 --> 06:55.030]  I like the way that they did this.
[06:55.030 --> 06:57.110]  A lot of the events we go to,
[06:57.110 --> 06:59.030]  the judges are offered a judges pack,
[06:59.030 --> 07:02.030]  where you're given a bag with every entry labeled
[07:02.030 --> 07:04.390]  with a number, and then you're supposed to consume that
[07:04.390 --> 07:06.990]  in your choice of method, if it's a bowl, a joint,
[07:06.990 --> 07:08.470]  however you wanna do it.
[07:08.470 --> 07:09.630]  So say there are 40 entries,
[07:09.630 --> 07:11.950]  you're given little baggies with numbers one through 40
[07:11.950 --> 07:13.470]  written on it, and you've gotta take your own notes
[07:13.470 --> 07:15.110]  and decide what the winner was.
[07:15.110 --> 07:17.430]  They did it a little bit differently at the Dude Grows Cup,
[07:17.430 --> 07:19.350]  and I kinda like the way that they did it.
[07:19.350 --> 07:21.510]  Instead of giving everybody a gift bag,
[07:21.510 --> 07:25.430]  there was a section, one whole section of the venue,
[07:25.430 --> 07:28.990]  where there were little bud tender stations lined up.
[07:28.990 --> 07:32.190]  There were basically countertops with jars
[07:32.190 --> 07:34.950]  of samples of entries, and all of those jars
[07:34.950 --> 07:35.910]  were labeled with a number.
[07:35.910 --> 07:37.950]  Like I said, I think there were about 50 entries.
[07:38.430 --> 07:39.750]  So they were labeled one through 50,
[07:39.750 --> 07:41.310]  and you would stand in line, and you would go up
[07:41.310 --> 07:43.910]  to the front, and then you would tell the bud tender
[07:43.910 --> 07:45.630]  what number samples you wanted to try.
[07:45.630 --> 07:47.510]  And the bud tenders had a few different samples
[07:47.510 --> 07:48.350]  in front of them.
[07:48.350 --> 07:49.650]  It looked like each bud tender had three or four,
[07:49.650 --> 07:51.390]  four or five different samples.
[07:51.390 --> 07:52.590]  So you'd walk up, you'd get in line,
[07:52.590 --> 07:53.550]  you'd walk up to one guy, you'd be like,
[07:53.550 --> 07:55.230]  I wanna try whatever he had in front of him,
[07:55.230 --> 07:56.670]  one, two, three, four, five.
[07:56.670 --> 07:59.310]  And they would give you a fresh one hitter when you started.
[07:59.310 --> 08:01.650]  So you had a brand new little clean one hitter pipe,
[08:01.650 --> 08:03.030]  and then you get to smoke each sample,
[08:03.030 --> 08:04.390]  but you gotta stand in line a few times
[08:04.390 --> 08:06.150]  to get through every sample.
[08:06.150 --> 08:07.310]  It was a cool way of doing it.
[08:07.670 --> 08:09.590]  Instead of just sitting there and hoarding
[08:09.590 --> 08:12.150]  your 50 sample pack, it made it a little more communal
[08:12.150 --> 08:14.110]  because everybody had to go up to that one area
[08:14.110 --> 08:16.750]  where the samples were, and you had to meet the bud tender,
[08:16.750 --> 08:18.750]  and you kinda had to hang out and be in line.
[08:18.750 --> 08:20.070]  And that being in line right there
[08:20.070 --> 08:22.190]  forced more people to interact.
[08:22.190 --> 08:25.310]  Because what I see a lot of at these events,
[08:25.310 --> 08:28.230]  I used to go with Kevin a lot, I would go with Pops.
[08:28.230 --> 08:29.770]  Now a lot of the times I end up up there
[08:29.770 --> 08:32.710]  with the Traveling Stoner and Bobo Blaster Co.
[08:32.710 --> 08:34.110]  And Brett from Evo Labs.
[08:34.110 --> 08:36.750]  We've gotten kinda clicky is what I think
[08:37.190 --> 08:38.030]  I'm trying to say.
[08:38.030 --> 08:39.270]  And when you put us all in a line like that
[08:39.270 --> 08:41.890]  to go taste the samples, all those clicks go away
[08:41.890 --> 08:44.070]  because you end up in line next to other people
[08:44.070 --> 08:45.750]  for five minutes, and then you end up making friends
[08:45.750 --> 08:46.590]  with new people.
[08:46.590 --> 08:47.830]  And I really like that aspect of it.
[08:47.830 --> 08:48.910]  It was really cool.
[08:48.910 --> 08:50.870]  I knew some people when I walked in there.
[08:50.870 --> 08:52.870]  I knew a lot of people when I left there.
[08:52.870 --> 08:54.950]  It was a really good social experience.
[08:55.990 --> 08:59.490]  A lot of the other dab and smoke events that we go to
[08:59.490 --> 09:02.430]  do seem to be a little clicky, a little elitist,
[09:02.430 --> 09:04.750]  a little, there's a little bit of a dickhead vibe at them.
[09:04.750 --> 09:07.190]  There wasn't any ego at this event.
[09:07.190 --> 09:09.270]  This was a bunch of people hanging out, smoking out.
[09:09.270 --> 09:11.310]  And one cool thing that they did,
[09:11.310 --> 09:13.350]  they did a huge raffle.
[09:13.350 --> 09:17.070]  They were selling tickets for this raffle, dirty cheap.
[09:17.070 --> 09:19.950]  And I kinda regret not participating in the raffle,
[09:19.950 --> 09:22.790]  but there wasn't anything that I absolutely
[09:22.790 --> 09:24.310]  would have loved to have had.
[09:24.310 --> 09:26.530]  But they were giving away Hordalux bulbs.
[09:26.530 --> 09:28.510]  They were giving away double-ended ceramic metal
[09:28.510 --> 09:30.590]  halide bulbs, which are brand new.
[09:30.590 --> 09:32.550]  They were giving away nutrient packs.
[09:32.550 --> 09:34.630]  They gave away tons of stuff, you guys.
[09:35.470 --> 09:36.550]  I've given away a few things on this podcast.
[09:36.550 --> 09:38.270]  They gave away a truckload of stuff.
[09:38.270 --> 09:40.950]  I've got a nice little kitchen area here where I record.
[09:40.950 --> 09:42.350]  The Grow From Your Heart podcast studio
[09:42.350 --> 09:43.830]  is honestly my dining room.
[09:43.830 --> 09:46.370]  All of the stuff they gave away would fill this space
[09:46.370 --> 09:47.310]  in a little pile.
[09:47.310 --> 09:48.350]  That's how much shit they gave away.
[09:48.350 --> 09:50.750]  So I thought it was super cool that the Dude Grows Cup
[09:50.750 --> 09:53.390]  was able to give back to the cannabis community.
[09:53.390 --> 09:55.390]  I'm pretty sure Way To Grow sponsored them.
[09:55.390 --> 09:57.490]  Mammoth P sponsored them.
[09:57.490 --> 09:59.470]  There was a bunch of, who's the company that they use,
[09:59.470 --> 10:01.870]  Recharge, Recharge was heavily involved.
[10:01.870 --> 10:03.430]  So there was a bunch of good giveaways.
[10:03.430 --> 10:05.190]  They gave away a bunch of Hortalux bulbs.
[10:05.190 --> 10:07.830]  I think they gave away a Quest dehumidifier.
[10:07.830 --> 10:09.950]  Bunch of shit was given away.
[10:09.950 --> 10:12.150]  So a huge shout out to the guys for giving stuff away.
[10:12.150 --> 10:13.910]  That means a lot to me that they give back.
[10:13.910 --> 10:16.910]  Now I was gonna talk about, I talked about the entries,
[10:16.910 --> 10:19.050]  and I talked a little bit about the judging.
[10:19.050 --> 10:21.310]  Now I kinda wanna talk a little bit about
[10:21.310 --> 10:23.630]  what I saw from the entries.
[10:23.630 --> 10:25.910]  There were approximately 50 entries from what I remember,
[10:25.910 --> 10:29.670]  and I was able to, I did kind of an asshole move,
[10:29.670 --> 10:31.430]  but I just wanted to be quick about it.
[10:31.430 --> 10:32.790]  And I think I made myself clear
[10:33.150 --> 10:33.990]  on what I was trying to do to anybody
[10:33.990 --> 10:35.190]  that was paying attention.
[10:35.190 --> 10:37.770]  So imagine all the lines are going one way, right?
[10:37.770 --> 10:39.430]  The lines are running back and forth.
[10:39.430 --> 10:41.870]  I walked up about three people into the line,
[10:41.870 --> 10:42.830]  and I didn't cut anybody,
[10:42.830 --> 10:43.790]  because I wasn't getting in the line,
[10:43.790 --> 10:45.550]  but I just cut through the wrong way.
[10:45.550 --> 10:47.950]  I just like, I crossed all the intersections,
[10:47.950 --> 10:49.190]  and I walked from one end to the other,
[10:49.190 --> 10:50.770]  and just eyeballed all of the samples.
[10:50.770 --> 10:53.790]  I just gave a quick visual glance,
[10:53.790 --> 10:55.310]  kind of a flyby, because I'm so tall.
[10:55.310 --> 10:58.550]  I just did a flyover, and crept at all the tables
[10:58.550 --> 11:00.310]  to see what the samples looked like.
[11:00.310 --> 11:02.430]  And that gave me a good idea of what I wanted to try
[11:03.070 --> 11:04.390]  before I even got in line to waste my time
[11:04.390 --> 11:06.510]  to go smoke some samples.
[11:06.510 --> 11:09.030]  I'm not trying to be an asshole here.
[11:09.030 --> 11:12.010]  I'm gonna say that 40 of those 50 samples
[11:12.010 --> 11:13.290]  needed to be trimmed.
[11:13.290 --> 11:15.590]  They did not trim them worth a shit.
[11:15.590 --> 11:18.050]  There were samples in there that could have been winners
[11:18.050 --> 11:21.850]  if the grower or trimmer would have taken another step
[11:21.850 --> 11:23.890]  and just knock off all those little shitty leaves
[11:23.890 --> 11:25.110]  that were on there.
[11:25.110 --> 11:27.190]  Jesse said, yeah, they do have a bunch of trichomes
[11:27.190 --> 11:29.910]  on those leaves, but it doesn't look good,
[11:29.910 --> 11:31.130]  and it's not appealing to me,
[11:31.130 --> 11:33.130]  and I'm certain that it affects the flavor.
[11:33.130 --> 11:34.450]  And you can knock those trichomes off
[11:34.450 --> 11:35.410]  and put it into your hash
[11:35.410 --> 11:37.170]  and make some concentrates out of it.
[11:37.170 --> 11:40.170]  So I think the main problem that I saw
[11:40.170 --> 11:42.610]  with most of the product, most of the entries,
[11:42.610 --> 11:43.650]  was that it was not trimmed.
[11:43.650 --> 11:46.730]  There was something that tasted like a blueberry.
[11:46.730 --> 11:49.170]  It had a real funky blueberry flavor to it.
[11:49.170 --> 11:50.730]  That one was delicious.
[11:50.730 --> 11:51.890]  There was one that was definitely
[11:51.890 --> 11:54.330]  Girl Scout Cookies dominant.
[11:54.330 --> 11:55.650]  That one was delicious.
[11:55.650 --> 11:57.450]  There was one that looked like it was gonna be real good,
[11:57.450 --> 12:00.810]  but it tasted kind of hay-like and kind of burnt my tongue.
[12:01.490 --> 12:02.770]  Then all of the others I kind of ignored
[12:02.770 --> 12:04.530]  because they were so leafy
[12:04.530 --> 12:06.250]  that it didn't even look appealing to smoke.
[12:06.250 --> 12:11.250]  So let's talk a little bit about how to trim your products
[12:11.250 --> 12:13.730]  if you want the best bag appeal
[12:13.730 --> 12:15.850]  and if you intend on entering something
[12:15.850 --> 12:18.090]  into a cup that is going to be judged.
[12:18.090 --> 12:18.970]  So let's talk about that.
[12:18.970 --> 12:20.290]  But first, I need to take a dab in a drink
[12:20.290 --> 12:21.610]  because I feel like I'm talking way too fast.
[12:21.610 --> 12:23.650]  So I'm gonna take care of my head and my face.
[12:23.650 --> 12:25.490]  Hopefully you guys take a quick dab too,
[12:25.490 --> 12:26.730]  and then I'll be right back.
[12:26.730 --> 12:30.130]  All right, podcast world, I am back.
[12:30.170 --> 12:32.170]  I'm well hydrated, I'm well medicated,
[12:32.170 --> 12:34.290]  I'm smoking some Golden Goat Shatter today.
[12:34.290 --> 12:36.130]  Shout out to the Barefoot Grower,
[12:36.130 --> 12:37.970]  Barefoot Extracts for keeping me laced up
[12:37.970 --> 12:40.850]  with super fresh, super clean, super delicious,
[12:40.850 --> 12:42.330]  super potent shatter.
[12:42.330 --> 12:44.330]  Good job, dude, good job, I appreciate it.
[12:44.330 --> 12:45.810]  I grow the products,
[12:45.810 --> 12:47.410]  and then I pass it over to our buddy Will,
[12:47.410 --> 12:50.090]  and he takes care of the extraction process for me.
[12:50.090 --> 12:52.850]  There's nothing like knowing that the products
[12:52.850 --> 12:56.850]  you're dabbing were grown with love and extracted with love.
[12:56.850 --> 12:58.370]  There's something sweet about knowing
[12:58.370 --> 13:00.010]  there's safety and quality in your medicine.
[13:00.850 --> 13:01.690]  I really enjoy it.
[13:01.690 --> 13:04.330]  Before we go into talking about proper trim technique,
[13:04.330 --> 13:06.130]  there are a couple things I missed in the intro here
[13:06.130 --> 13:08.530]  because I was just rambling my face off.
[13:08.530 --> 13:10.370]  I mentioned in previous episodes
[13:10.370 --> 13:12.970]  that I was going to record a podcast at the Dude Gross Cup.
[13:12.970 --> 13:14.050]  That did not happen, you guys.
[13:14.050 --> 13:16.590]  I had all of the recording equipment that I needed with me.
[13:16.590 --> 13:18.570]  It was really loud in there.
[13:18.570 --> 13:21.250]  I would not have been able to get any useful recording
[13:21.250 --> 13:23.310]  even if I did try to set up and record.
[13:23.310 --> 13:24.370]  The music was fucking loud,
[13:24.370 --> 13:25.890]  there were a bunch of people in there.
[13:25.890 --> 13:27.430]  You had to kind of yell,
[13:27.430 --> 13:29.210]  and it sucks when you're in a place that loud
[13:29.210 --> 13:30.410]  and you were smoking dabs
[13:30.410 --> 13:32.250]  and you're trying to yell over everybody.
[13:32.250 --> 13:33.370]  That's kind of why.
[13:33.370 --> 13:37.410]  That's why my voice sounds like I am Mr. Movie Phone.
[13:37.410 --> 13:39.250]  Press one if you know the name of the movie
[13:39.250 --> 13:40.290]  you'd like to see.
[13:40.290 --> 13:41.770]  That's from taking too many dabs
[13:41.770 --> 13:43.890]  and trying to yell over everybody all night.
[13:44.830 --> 13:47.690]  So excuse the throat and the excessive throat clearing.
[13:47.690 --> 13:49.090]  But that's why I did not record.
[13:49.090 --> 13:50.530]  That's why there is no live stuff
[13:50.530 --> 13:53.310]  coming from the Dude Gross Cup that I recorded.
[13:53.310 --> 13:55.630]  Also, I talked about the judging.
[13:55.630 --> 13:57.290]  I never talked about the voting.
[13:57.290 --> 13:58.890]  When you walked into the Dude Gross Cup,
[13:59.570 --> 14:00.410]  you were given a lanyard,
[14:00.410 --> 14:01.450]  which meant you were a judge.
[14:01.450 --> 14:03.330]  And around the lanyard are the,
[14:03.330 --> 14:04.390]  it's right over there, it's out of reach.
[14:04.390 --> 14:06.010]  I'm not gonna walk away from the microphone to get it.
[14:06.010 --> 14:08.490]  But around the lanyard are numbers,
[14:08.490 --> 14:10.050]  and that's how many entries there were.
[14:10.050 --> 14:11.670]  So when you go and you sample the entry,
[14:11.670 --> 14:14.330]  they punch that number off of your lanyard
[14:14.330 --> 14:16.690]  so they know that you've tested sample number one.
[14:16.690 --> 14:19.330]  And then there's a number one, two, three, four, five,
[14:19.330 --> 14:20.330]  however many entries there are.
[14:20.330 --> 14:22.470]  I think there were 40, maybe 50.
[14:22.470 --> 14:24.090]  They punch out the number that you've tried
[14:24.090 --> 14:25.690]  so that that way you can't just keep smoking
[14:25.690 --> 14:27.010]  the same entries over and over
[14:27.010 --> 14:28.110]  so that if you fall in love with one,
[14:28.110 --> 14:30.070]  you can't go smoke all of it.
[14:30.070 --> 14:33.390]  So the voting went, also when you walked in,
[14:33.390 --> 14:34.530]  they gave you some tokens.
[14:34.530 --> 14:36.590]  They look like some Pirates of the Caribbean tokens.
[14:36.590 --> 14:37.750]  They're just plastic tokens.
[14:37.750 --> 14:39.190]  They probably got them from the dollar store,
[14:39.190 --> 14:40.950]  the party store or something.
[14:40.950 --> 14:42.650]  But there are some plastic tokens.
[14:42.650 --> 14:44.890]  And if you appreciated a strain,
[14:44.890 --> 14:47.830]  you were to give the bud tender that token
[14:47.830 --> 14:50.070]  and ask them to put it, the jars were behind them.
[14:50.070 --> 14:51.230]  So you would give them the token
[14:51.230 --> 14:52.350]  and they would put it in the number.
[14:52.350 --> 14:54.750]  You'd say, hey, I like number 22 the best.
[14:54.750 --> 14:56.550]  Will you throw this token into number 22?
[14:56.550 --> 14:57.990]  And I think you were given five tokens
[14:58.830 --> 14:59.950]  when you walked in and you were also given
[14:59.950 --> 15:01.790]  one free raffle ticket when you walked in
[15:01.790 --> 15:04.070]  so that you had to, everybody won something.
[15:04.070 --> 15:05.910]  But I left before the end of the raffle
[15:05.910 --> 15:08.550]  because the raffle was taking for freaking ever.
[15:08.550 --> 15:10.490]  And then they even, Scotty and the dude
[15:10.490 --> 15:11.550]  had to take a break in the middle
[15:11.550 --> 15:13.790]  because the raffle was taking so long.
[15:13.790 --> 15:14.870]  So I've talked about the voting.
[15:14.870 --> 15:16.350]  I talked about the tokens they gave us.
[15:16.350 --> 15:20.010]  I apologize for not recording any live material at the event.
[15:20.010 --> 15:22.030]  Honestly, you guys, I was having a good ass time
[15:22.030 --> 15:24.790]  taking dabs with my old friends and my new friends.
[15:24.790 --> 15:25.830]  It was cool introducing.
[15:25.830 --> 15:28.510]  So Jesse, Jesse Gross is a cool guy.
[15:28.510 --> 15:30.390]  He's a little bit shy.
[15:30.390 --> 15:31.470]  I don't know that shy, I don't,
[15:31.470 --> 15:34.830]  he's just not as socially outgoing as myself.
[15:34.830 --> 15:36.870]  And so when people would start talking to me,
[15:36.870 --> 15:38.410]  sometimes I need a little bit of a break.
[15:38.410 --> 15:39.550]  My throat starts burning out
[15:39.550 --> 15:40.630]  and I wanna take a dab and chill.
[15:40.630 --> 15:43.030]  So I'd be like, hey, that's Jesse from the show.
[15:43.030 --> 15:45.670]  And several people were super excited to meet Jesse.
[15:45.670 --> 15:48.470]  People were thanking Jesse for all their outdoor success,
[15:48.470 --> 15:51.410]  especially Tony, because my new friend Tony
[15:51.410 --> 15:52.710]  is growing out in New Mexico.
[15:52.710 --> 15:54.310]  He's growing in an outdoor environment
[15:54.310 --> 15:57.790]  and Jesse has taught him a ton of useful information.
[15:57.790 --> 16:00.630]  So Jesse, I hope that wasn't too much for you.
[16:00.630 --> 16:01.550]  And 44 was there.
[16:01.550 --> 16:04.030]  I got to introduce 44 to a few podcast listeners.
[16:04.030 --> 16:05.650]  So that was kind of cool.
[16:05.650 --> 16:07.550]  But my point is I was too busy being social
[16:07.550 --> 16:09.990]  and having fun to record and it was too loud in there.
[16:09.990 --> 16:11.390]  So recording didn't happen.
[16:11.390 --> 16:13.470]  A lot of people are gonna say, hey, who won?
[16:13.470 --> 16:15.550]  Which strain won the Dude Gross Cup?
[16:15.550 --> 16:17.390]  Honestly, you guys, it was 1030.
[16:17.390 --> 16:20.230]  I was tired as high as giraffe pussy.
[16:20.230 --> 16:21.810]  I had a two hour drive to get home.
[16:21.810 --> 16:23.270]  Plus I had to work today.
[16:23.270 --> 16:25.110]  So I had to pack up my stuff and get out of there.
[16:25.110 --> 16:27.310]  Around 1030 or 11, I boogied out,
[16:27.310 --> 16:28.650]  drove back down to Pueblo.
[16:29.710 --> 16:31.070]  No incident on the drive.
[16:31.070 --> 16:33.030]  Nice straight two hour drive, made it.
[16:33.030 --> 16:34.630]  About 130 miles to the house.
[16:34.630 --> 16:37.030]  I got home late, crashed out for a couple hours,
[16:37.030 --> 16:39.070]  woke up and I had to go take care of the grow
[16:39.070 --> 16:41.230]  because I'm a nice boss and I gave the whole grow crew
[16:41.230 --> 16:42.350]  the day off today.
[16:42.350 --> 16:45.350]  So I did not stick around for the judging.
[16:45.350 --> 16:48.350]  I do not know who won the Dude Gross Cup.
[16:48.350 --> 16:49.190]  Here's a good plug.
[16:49.190 --> 16:51.750]  If you want to know who won the Dude Gross Cup,
[16:51.750 --> 16:54.390]  Monday, you've got to listen to the Dude Gross Show.
[16:54.390 --> 16:55.230]  That's what you can do.
[16:55.230 --> 16:56.330]  Go check out their podcast.
[16:56.330 --> 16:57.350]  It's a great podcast.
[16:57.350 --> 16:59.270]  It's a little bit different format than mine,
[16:59.270 --> 17:01.070]  but you will certainly enjoy it.
[17:01.070 --> 17:02.590]  Since I'm talking about pitching podcasts,
[17:02.590 --> 17:04.310]  you guys, I am gonna talk about trimming buds here
[17:04.310 --> 17:05.150]  in just a minute,
[17:05.150 --> 17:07.310]  but I've got a bunch of other stuff on my mind.
[17:07.310 --> 17:10.150]  I took a dab and so it just made my ADD fire up.
[17:10.150 --> 17:11.670]  Speaking of podcasts,
[17:11.670 --> 17:15.070]  several people mentioned my friend Bo Nellis.
[17:15.070 --> 17:16.590]  We would be talking about podcasts.
[17:16.590 --> 17:17.950]  We'd be talking about whatever
[17:17.950 --> 17:19.430]  and people would bring up Bo.
[17:19.430 --> 17:21.190]  Bo, you were loved in the community.
[17:21.630 --> 17:22.710]  We need to get you out here to Colorado
[17:22.710 --> 17:26.190]  to one of these events so that you can partake in the dabs.
[17:26.190 --> 17:27.270]  You can hang out with the people
[17:27.270 --> 17:28.310]  and you can just feel what it's like
[17:28.310 --> 17:29.830]  to have a bunch of people saying,
[17:29.830 --> 17:32.070]  hey, thank you for doing a podcast
[17:32.070 --> 17:34.430]  that helps me connect with myself and my medicine.
[17:34.430 --> 17:35.270]  It's really cool.
[17:35.270 --> 17:36.090]  It's a good feeling.
[17:36.090 --> 17:37.510]  So Bo, you got to get out here.
[17:37.510 --> 17:38.390]  People love you.
[17:38.390 --> 17:39.710]  You're part of this podcast world
[17:39.710 --> 17:42.030]  that's helping the cannabis community.
[17:42.030 --> 17:44.150]  Come take some dabs with us.
[17:44.150 --> 17:46.150]  I guess that's a good time to tell you guys about Patreon,
[17:46.150 --> 17:47.750]  right here in the middle of the podcast.
[17:47.750 --> 17:51.010]  Patreon, if you would like to help myself or Bo Nellis
[17:51.830 --> 17:54.170]  or any podcasters out, you can go to patreon.com.
[17:54.170 --> 17:57.010]  You can go to patreon.com slash grow from your heart
[17:57.010 --> 17:58.650]  and you can read all about how to contribute
[17:58.650 --> 18:00.010]  to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[18:00.010 --> 18:02.170]  Patreon is a service that allows listeners
[18:02.170 --> 18:04.450]  to financially contribute to podcasts.
[18:04.450 --> 18:05.610]  We're not trying to get rich.
[18:05.610 --> 18:08.730]  It costs us money to put the website up
[18:08.730 --> 18:09.930]  so that we can host the show.
[18:09.930 --> 18:11.030]  Guys, my website sucks.
[18:11.030 --> 18:11.870]  I'm sorry.
[18:11.870 --> 18:14.530]  I do not spend a lot of time working on my website.
[18:14.530 --> 18:17.610]  Right now, it's basically just a crash,
[18:17.610 --> 18:20.530]  but that's how my podcast is hosted to iTunes
[18:21.050 --> 18:22.250]  to Stitcher to Feedburner to Podbay,
[18:22.250 --> 18:23.810]  wherever else you're watching it.
[18:23.810 --> 18:26.010]  That's how it's happening is through my website.
[18:26.010 --> 18:28.370]  So when you go to Patreon, when you contribute,
[18:28.370 --> 18:30.890]  what that funding does, that helps me pay
[18:30.890 --> 18:33.210]  for my Bluehost account, which pays for my website.
[18:33.210 --> 18:34.030]  That's what that does.
[18:34.030 --> 18:35.730]  So if you wanna help out a podcaster,
[18:35.730 --> 18:37.850]  most podcasters do have a Patreon account.
[18:37.850 --> 18:39.450]  So you can go to my Patreon.
[18:39.450 --> 18:42.210]  It's patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[18:42.210 --> 18:44.370]  I am not exactly sure what the Bo Nellis
[18:44.370 --> 18:46.450]  and Spliff podcast Patreons are,
[18:46.450 --> 18:47.930]  but if you search, you will find it.
[18:47.930 --> 18:49.090]  You can help out a podcaster.
[18:49.090 --> 18:51.710]  Maybe in the future, we'll set up a Patreon
[18:51.710 --> 18:55.190]  to try to get Bo to Colorado so that we can all record a big,
[18:56.050 --> 18:57.890]  we'll get the Dude Grows, we'll get Scotty Real,
[18:57.890 --> 18:59.770]  we'll get myself, we'll get Bo Nellis,
[18:59.770 --> 19:01.770]  and we'll do like a giant MVP podcast
[19:01.770 --> 19:03.370]  where I'll record an episode together.
[19:03.370 --> 19:04.990]  We'll drop it on everybody's feed.
[19:04.990 --> 19:08.330]  That would be epic cannabis podcasting.
[19:08.330 --> 19:10.290]  All right, I keep talking about trimming weed.
[19:10.290 --> 19:12.810]  I'm holding this Capleton nugget in my hand.
[19:12.810 --> 19:14.250]  It could use a little bit of love.
[19:14.250 --> 19:15.090]  It could use some attention.
[19:15.090 --> 19:16.570]  It could use some trimming.
[19:16.570 --> 19:20.370]  Let's talk about trimming your weed.
[19:20.370 --> 19:22.570]  I don't wanna go into too much detail about harvesting
[19:22.570 --> 19:24.050]  because I've done complete episodes
[19:24.050 --> 19:26.050]  about harvesting full plants.
[19:26.050 --> 19:27.370]  That is a whole nother podcast.
[19:27.370 --> 19:28.610]  And if it's not in the feed,
[19:28.610 --> 19:29.570]  I'm sure you guys are aware
[19:29.570 --> 19:31.690]  that I've been putting old episodes out on Thursdays.
[19:31.690 --> 19:34.310]  I put chunks of three or four episodes out every Thursday.
[19:34.310 --> 19:38.250]  Those are episodes from the past, a long, long time ago.
[19:38.250 --> 19:40.530]  The show used to be called I Grow Culture.
[19:40.530 --> 19:43.290]  There's another organization that goes by the name I Grow.
[19:43.290 --> 19:44.730]  I kindly changed my name
[19:44.730 --> 19:46.170]  so that I don't get myself in any trouble.
[19:46.810 --> 19:48.410]  I don't wanna be associated with them on accident.
[19:48.410 --> 19:50.490]  So now the show is called The Grow From Your Heart Podcast,
[19:50.490 --> 19:53.170]  which is much more suiting in my opinion.
[19:53.170 --> 19:55.130]  But anyway, I've been putting out old episodes
[19:55.130 --> 19:57.230]  because a lot of the episodes fall out of the feed.
[19:57.230 --> 20:00.210]  iTunes and Stitcher only hold 100 episodes.
[20:00.210 --> 20:01.890]  And a lot of the good stuff is in the past
[20:01.890 --> 20:04.130]  and the old episodes were up to 200 now.
[20:04.130 --> 20:05.970]  And that means there's 100 episodes
[20:05.970 --> 20:06.970]  that are no longer in the feed.
[20:06.970 --> 20:08.570]  So I'm going to put in chunks out
[20:08.570 --> 20:10.630]  so that I can try to get those old episodes in the feed
[20:10.630 --> 20:12.890]  without knocking out current stuff.
[20:12.890 --> 20:15.850]  Another thing I'm doing is I am making those YouTube videos.
[20:16.530 --> 20:17.570]  I talk about that a lot.
[20:17.570 --> 20:19.330]  It's coming, it's time consuming.
[20:19.330 --> 20:20.870]  I have a life, I have a lot going on.
[20:20.870 --> 20:22.210]  I'm trying to get those out for you.
[20:22.210 --> 20:23.370]  But I'm trying to get the old episodes.
[20:23.370 --> 20:25.370]  So the episode all about harvesting
[20:25.370 --> 20:27.750]  will be either in the feed on YouTube
[20:27.750 --> 20:29.650]  or coming soon in those old episodes
[20:29.650 --> 20:31.050]  is what I'm getting to.
[20:31.050 --> 20:33.370]  Today we're just gonna talk about the kind of fun,
[20:33.370 --> 20:34.610]  the final fine trim.
[20:34.610 --> 20:36.850]  Let's say you've harvested your plant.
[20:36.850 --> 20:38.730]  I will just real quickly go over this.
[20:38.730 --> 20:40.130]  You've flushed your plant.
[20:40.130 --> 20:43.050]  That is the beginning of harvest, flush.
[20:43.050 --> 20:45.210]  All you need to do is feed your plant
[20:45.210 --> 20:47.130]  clean pH balanced water.
[20:47.130 --> 20:47.970]  It's free.
[20:47.970 --> 20:49.450]  All you gotta do is get a container.
[20:49.450 --> 20:52.050]  However many plants you use, however much water you use,
[20:52.050 --> 20:53.090]  fill that container.
[20:53.090 --> 20:55.890]  Use some pH up or pH down, probably pH down,
[20:55.890 --> 20:56.970]  most locations.
[20:56.970 --> 20:59.410]  Use some pH down, get that water to the proper pH.
[20:59.410 --> 21:02.090]  You want it around somewhere between six and 6.5.
[21:02.090 --> 21:03.170]  That's up to you.
[21:03.170 --> 21:06.130]  I like to do about 6.2 when I'm flushing.
[21:06.130 --> 21:09.970]  pH that water to 6.2 and pour it through the plants.
[21:09.970 --> 21:12.050]  And for the next days, next 10 days,
[21:12.050 --> 21:13.010]  just keep doing that.
[21:13.010 --> 21:14.170]  Don't ever add nutrients.
[21:14.170 --> 21:15.850]  Whenever the plants get, you water them,
[21:15.850 --> 21:18.050]  you let them get dry and show you that they're thirsty.
[21:18.050 --> 21:21.170]  Mix up some more water that's 6.2 and water those plants.
[21:21.170 --> 21:22.570]  You do that for at least 10 days.
[21:22.570 --> 21:24.730]  You can do it for 10 to 14, maybe 17.
[21:24.730 --> 21:27.330]  I've seen people do it for 21 full days.
[21:27.330 --> 21:28.570]  All you gotta do is flush your plants.
[21:28.570 --> 21:29.410]  It's free.
[21:29.410 --> 21:30.490]  You don't have to put nutrients in there.
[21:30.490 --> 21:32.770]  That's that much nutrients you were saving.
[21:32.770 --> 21:34.450]  Flush your damn plants.
[21:34.450 --> 21:36.090]  Sorry, I get on a rant when I talk about flushing
[21:36.090 --> 21:38.270]  because it's so easy and people do not do it.
[21:38.270 --> 21:39.370]  And it's evident.
[21:39.370 --> 21:40.810]  As soon as I take a hit off your bowl,
[21:40.810 --> 21:42.410]  before that smoke hits my lungs,
[21:42.410 --> 21:44.490]  I can say, you didn't flush that.
[21:44.490 --> 21:46.450]  And the funny part is, one of our friends that I met
[21:46.450 --> 21:49.090]  at the Dude Grows Cup passed me some weed.
[21:49.090 --> 21:50.970]  And he's like, this one's got like a spicy taste to it.
[21:50.970 --> 21:52.810]  And I hit it and I blew out the hit.
[21:52.810 --> 21:54.970]  Before I got my smoke all the way out of my lungs,
[21:54.970 --> 21:55.810]  I could taste it.
[21:55.810 --> 22:00.370]  And I said, do you use worm casting tea in your mix?
[22:00.370 --> 22:01.210]  And he said, yes.
[22:01.210 --> 22:02.090]  And I said, I think you're using
[22:02.090 --> 22:03.490]  a little too much worm castings
[22:03.490 --> 22:06.370]  because I can taste compost and worm castings.
[22:06.370 --> 22:09.050]  And his buddy, excuse me, my throat's clogging up.
[22:09.050 --> 22:09.890]  I apologize.
[22:09.890 --> 22:11.370]  Quick drink.
[22:11.370 --> 22:12.810]  Anyway, this dude's friend said,
[22:12.810 --> 22:14.970]  I told you you've been going too hard with the worm casting.
[22:14.970 --> 22:16.050]  So I could taste that shit in there.
[22:16.050 --> 22:16.890]  So flush your plants.
[22:16.890 --> 22:17.710]  That's what I'm saying.
[22:17.710 --> 22:19.470]  And don't use too much stuff.
[22:19.470 --> 22:22.510]  It's hard to flush out anything that you've used excessively.
[22:22.510 --> 22:23.550]  I like Veg Bloom, you guys.
[22:23.550 --> 22:24.930]  It seems to flush out really clean.
[22:24.930 --> 22:26.770]  That's not a paid advertisement or anything,
[22:26.770 --> 22:28.530]  but Veg Bloom seems like it flushed out
[22:28.530 --> 22:30.610]  very nicely in my plants.
[22:30.610 --> 22:31.610]  So flush.
[22:31.610 --> 22:33.130]  Then pre-trim.
[22:33.130 --> 22:35.210]  You can go in and take off all the large leaves
[22:35.210 --> 22:36.330]  a few days before harvest.
[22:36.330 --> 22:37.650]  Just chop those off, take them off.
[22:37.650 --> 22:39.130]  It makes it easier.
[22:39.130 --> 22:40.250]  Then cut your plants down.
[22:40.250 --> 22:41.690]  Let them hang upside down.
[22:42.950 --> 22:45.430]  You can either wet trim or dry trim at this point.
[22:45.430 --> 22:47.130]  Wet trim obviously means you go at them
[22:47.130 --> 22:47.970]  while they're still wet.
[22:47.970 --> 22:49.410]  You're gonna need some scissors.
[22:49.410 --> 22:50.290]  You're gonna need gloves.
[22:50.290 --> 22:52.610]  No matter how you do this, wear gloves, please.
[22:52.610 --> 22:55.290]  Get yourself some nitrile gloves, some latex gloves.
[22:55.290 --> 22:56.130]  Glove up.
[22:56.130 --> 22:58.050]  You don't want trichomes all over yourself
[22:58.050 --> 22:59.610]  and I don't wanna smoke your skin flakes.
[22:59.610 --> 23:00.730]  That shit's gross.
[23:00.730 --> 23:02.330]  So get some gloves.
[23:02.330 --> 23:03.170]  They're cheap.
[23:03.170 --> 23:04.010]  They're affordable.
[23:04.010 --> 23:06.090]  Just go to Walgreens, go to Walmart.
[23:06.090 --> 23:08.090]  I like to order mine off of amazon.com.
[23:08.130 --> 23:09.370]  They come straight to the house.
[23:09.370 --> 23:11.770]  If you're gonna buy a bunch, I recommend Uline.
[23:11.770 --> 23:12.930]  Uline sells a lot of gloves,
[23:12.930 --> 23:14.610]  but you gotta buy a bunch of them.
[23:14.610 --> 23:18.530]  Get yourself a bucket of extra large black gloves.
[23:18.530 --> 23:19.370]  They're awesome.
[23:19.370 --> 23:20.290]  That's how we do it.
[23:20.290 --> 23:21.770]  Anyway, let's get back on track here.
[23:21.770 --> 23:23.670]  I'm high as giraffe pussy today.
[23:23.670 --> 23:25.190]  So you can wet trim or you can dry trim.
[23:25.190 --> 23:26.570]  Obviously wet trim, you cut it down,
[23:26.570 --> 23:27.770]  you start trimming now while it's wet.
[23:27.770 --> 23:28.610]  It's super sticky.
[23:28.610 --> 23:29.970]  It's kind of a pain in the ass,
[23:29.970 --> 23:31.590]  but once you're done trimming, it's over.
[23:31.590 --> 23:32.610]  There's nothing left to do.
[23:32.610 --> 23:34.330]  You can get it all handled at one time.
[23:34.330 --> 23:35.610]  You gotta let it hang there and dry
[23:35.610 --> 23:36.450]  and then you gotta cure it.
[23:36.450 --> 23:37.990]  That's all that's gonna have to happen.
[23:38.850 --> 23:40.470]  You can cut the plant down,
[23:40.470 --> 23:42.230]  let it hang upside down until it's dry,
[23:42.230 --> 23:43.310]  and then you can trim it like that.
[23:43.310 --> 23:45.470]  You still need gloves, but it's not as sticky.
[23:45.470 --> 23:46.750]  It's not as funky.
[23:46.750 --> 23:47.910]  You can just wear gloves.
[23:47.910 --> 23:49.090]  I like to kind of grab the buds
[23:49.090 --> 23:51.110]  and get in there with my finger, my thumbnails.
[23:51.110 --> 23:52.790]  You're wearing gloves, so it's not really your thumbnail,
[23:52.790 --> 23:53.630]  but it's like your thumb tip
[23:53.630 --> 23:55.510]  and you can just knock the leaves off with your thumb
[23:55.510 --> 23:57.170]  and you can go super fast.
[23:57.170 --> 23:59.830]  So the thing when you're wet trimming,
[24:00.710 --> 24:02.430]  I like wet trimming because you can get in there
[24:02.430 --> 24:04.190]  and really cut off everything.
[24:04.190 --> 24:06.030]  And then when it dries, the bud shrinks up
[24:06.030 --> 24:08.830]  and you can't see any leaf in there at all.
[24:08.830 --> 24:12.470]  Some bud textures, it's very advantageous
[24:12.470 --> 24:13.990]  to trim it while the bud's wet.
[24:13.990 --> 24:16.430]  A lot of stuff, my stuff that like the Grateful Dog,
[24:16.430 --> 24:18.790]  the Capleton, the Capleton I'm holding right now,
[24:18.790 --> 24:20.850]  this is really dense and it's not super leafy,
[24:20.850 --> 24:22.750]  so I like to dry trim this.
[24:22.750 --> 24:24.810]  So I cut down the plant.
[24:24.810 --> 24:26.270]  So I flush it, of course.
[24:26.270 --> 24:27.470]  I take off all the big leaves.
[24:27.470 --> 24:28.290]  I cut it down.
[24:28.290 --> 24:29.930]  I let it hang upside down for four.
[24:29.930 --> 24:30.770]  I'm in Colorado.
[24:30.770 --> 24:32.110]  It's dry here.
[24:32.110 --> 24:34.350]  I hang it upside down until the sticks snap,
[24:34.350 --> 24:35.870]  like grab a stem and bend it,
[24:36.710 --> 24:37.550]  and you want it to go crunch.
[24:37.550 --> 24:38.610]  That's when it's ready.
[24:39.690 --> 24:40.950]  Then I take that plant.
[24:40.950 --> 24:45.010]  I cut all the buds off of the sticks into like a bucket.
[24:45.010 --> 24:46.630]  It's like a big dish.
[24:46.630 --> 24:49.030]  I just cut all the buds off the sticks into that dish.
[24:49.030 --> 24:50.450]  And then I throw all the sticks away.
[24:50.450 --> 24:51.630]  The sticks are gone.
[24:51.630 --> 24:54.790]  Now I've got a bucket or a bowl of nice buds
[24:54.790 --> 24:55.750]  with little leaves on it.
[24:55.750 --> 24:59.150]  Then I go through and I cut off all of the,
[24:59.150 --> 25:00.110]  like the sugar leaves.
[25:00.110 --> 25:01.990]  I keep all of that sugar leaf
[25:01.990 --> 25:03.690]  and I make hash out of all of that.
[25:03.690 --> 25:05.590]  Anything that's got a little bit of trichome on it
[25:06.310 --> 25:08.590]  goes into another container and it dries out real fine.
[25:08.590 --> 25:09.910]  And that gets turned into hash.
[25:09.910 --> 25:11.350]  And that is my cheap, get crazy,
[25:11.350 --> 25:14.030]  take giant dabs and waste a bunch of dabs hash.
[25:14.030 --> 25:15.710]  When my friends come over,
[25:15.710 --> 25:16.910]  when I smoke with a bunch of people,
[25:16.910 --> 25:19.030]  that's the, you can take as big of a dab as you want
[25:19.030 --> 25:20.590]  because this is just trim run.
[25:20.590 --> 25:22.910]  That's what happens with that.
[25:22.910 --> 25:24.830]  So I fine trim.
[25:24.830 --> 25:26.110]  Once I knock off all that big stuff,
[25:26.110 --> 25:27.870]  I fine trim the bud, which,
[25:27.870 --> 25:29.250]  so I've got this little bud of capelton.
[25:29.250 --> 25:31.230]  All the big stuff's basically been taken off.
[25:31.230 --> 25:32.670]  You can see the bud shape.
[25:32.670 --> 25:35.390]  There are these little tiny, tiny buds sticking out.
[25:36.190 --> 25:37.830]  And I'm honestly just knocking them off with my thumbnail.
[25:37.830 --> 25:38.990]  You can almost hear it.
[25:39.950 --> 25:41.190]  But that was excessive.
[25:41.190 --> 25:42.530]  That was my thumb hitting the microphone
[25:42.530 --> 25:43.670]  after it knocked it off.
[25:43.670 --> 25:45.810]  But you can, I'm just basically rubbing this bud
[25:45.810 --> 25:47.990]  and brushing off most of these little leaves
[25:47.990 --> 25:50.790]  because it's dry enough, but it's not super crusty.
[25:50.790 --> 25:52.350]  And those leaves are coming right off.
[25:52.350 --> 25:53.650]  It's really easy to knock.
[25:54.750 --> 25:57.150]  Excuse me for the clogged up throat, you guys.
[25:57.150 --> 25:59.950]  That's from the dude grows cup in like a billion dabs.
[25:59.950 --> 26:02.070]  But it's really easy just to knock those leaves off.
[26:02.070 --> 26:04.470]  There's no reason to leave that stuff on there.
[26:04.470 --> 26:07.270]  There are two things that really drive me crazy.
[26:07.270 --> 26:08.910]  And you're gonna laugh when I say the words,
[26:08.910 --> 26:10.870]  but when I explain them, you will completely understand.
[26:10.870 --> 26:12.590]  One thing that drives me fucking nuts
[26:12.590 --> 26:14.190]  is something called crow's feet.
[26:14.190 --> 26:16.930]  Those little tiny, tiny leaves that are sticking out.
[26:16.930 --> 26:19.430]  Like there's a part where this one bud
[26:19.430 --> 26:20.750]  meets another part of the bud.
[26:20.750 --> 26:22.590]  And there's a little leaf just sticking out of there
[26:22.590 --> 26:24.630]  that right now I'm just gonna pull it off with my fingers.
[26:24.630 --> 26:27.030]  If you leave that on there, that's called a crow's foot.
[26:27.030 --> 26:27.950]  It's just a little pokey.
[26:27.950 --> 26:28.910]  You know, it's a V.
[26:28.910 --> 26:30.190]  Two leaves that stick off like a V.
[26:30.190 --> 26:31.430]  It's ugly as shit.
[26:31.430 --> 26:33.470]  When you gotta pound a weed with a bunch of crow's feet in it
[26:33.470 --> 26:34.510]  it makes it look ugly.
[26:34.510 --> 26:36.350]  If you take out all those crow's feet,
[26:36.350 --> 26:38.550]  that pound a weed looks way better.
[26:38.550 --> 26:39.990]  Just clean that shit up.
[26:39.990 --> 26:41.510]  I hate that stuff.
[26:41.510 --> 26:43.390]  Then there's another thing that is still on this bud
[26:43.390 --> 26:44.590]  because it's not done being trimmed.
[26:44.590 --> 26:46.070]  It's called the handlebars.
[26:46.070 --> 26:47.150]  At the bottom of the bud
[26:47.150 --> 26:49.270]  where the bud's been cut off of the stick,
[26:49.270 --> 26:52.110]  there are two little sticks, little tiny, tiny stems
[26:52.110 --> 26:53.990]  where a leaf used to be on each side.
[26:53.990 --> 26:55.490]  Those are called handlebars.
[26:55.490 --> 26:57.350]  If you have a bud and you hold it upside down,
[26:57.350 --> 26:58.350]  you'll know exactly what I mean.
[26:58.350 --> 27:00.510]  It looks like G.I. Joe can make a jet ski
[27:00.510 --> 27:01.350]  out of this little bud.
[27:01.350 --> 27:02.550]  And that's where G.I. Joe would hold on
[27:02.550 --> 27:05.470]  is to these two little sticks where there used to be leaves.
[27:05.470 --> 27:07.130]  Those drive me fucking crazy.
[27:07.130 --> 27:09.830]  Get rid of your handlebars, get rid of your crow's feet,
[27:09.830 --> 27:11.990]  and it will make your buds look way better.
[27:11.990 --> 27:13.230]  It's not a lot of effort.
[27:13.230 --> 27:14.590]  It's just a little bit of time.
[27:14.590 --> 27:17.550]  Slow down, get in there, take that shit out.
[27:17.550 --> 27:18.790]  That was the main difference
[27:18.790 --> 27:21.510]  between the winning and losing buds that I saw last night.
[27:21.510 --> 27:23.050]  So just trim your shit up.
[27:23.050 --> 27:25.310]  You should be able to see the shape of the bud.
[27:25.310 --> 27:27.270]  Don't get excessive and get in there and mash it up.
[27:27.270 --> 27:29.810]  So if you're dry trimming, you should be able to rub it
[27:29.810 --> 27:32.030]  and you'll see exactly the shape of your bud.
[27:32.030 --> 27:33.510]  And if it's not a dense bud,
[27:33.510 --> 27:35.550]  you may need to work on adding some kelp products.
[27:35.550 --> 27:36.750]  You need to get some airflow in there
[27:36.750 --> 27:37.710]  and you may need more light
[27:37.710 --> 27:39.470]  or you may need a better phenotype.
[27:39.470 --> 27:40.790]  But when it's dry trimmed,
[27:40.790 --> 27:41.950]  you should be able to just kind of rub it
[27:41.950 --> 27:43.030]  and knock off all those leaves.
[27:43.030 --> 27:45.550]  If it's wet trimmed, you don't need to pull it open too far,
[27:45.550 --> 27:47.830]  but pull it open a little bit and cut those leaves out.
[27:47.830 --> 27:49.870]  And when the bud dries, it'll shrink around those leaves
[27:49.870 --> 27:51.350]  and you won't even see them in there.
[27:51.350 --> 27:52.190]  It'll be just fine.
[27:52.190 --> 27:53.030]  But take that stuff out
[27:53.030 --> 27:54.950]  because it's making your weed look terrible.
[27:54.950 --> 27:58.930]  You could have, and also leaves contain chlorophyll.
[27:58.930 --> 28:00.110]  You don't want to smoke chlorophyll.
[28:00.110 --> 28:01.030]  It does not taste good.
[28:01.030 --> 28:02.230]  It takes it longer to cure.
[28:02.230 --> 28:03.150]  It's funky.
[28:03.150 --> 28:04.230]  We're not here to smoke leaf.
[28:04.230 --> 28:05.630]  We're here to smoke buds.
[28:05.630 --> 28:07.510]  We're honestly here to smoke trichome resin.
[28:07.510 --> 28:09.310]  We don't even need this green part.
[28:09.310 --> 28:11.790]  So let's minimize the green shit that we're smoking.
[28:11.790 --> 28:14.790]  Focus on the good part, smoke what we want.
[28:14.790 --> 28:16.510]  Also, what drives me crazy,
[28:18.190 --> 28:19.070]  sticks.
[28:19.070 --> 28:21.590]  When people try to have a gigantic bud,
[28:21.590 --> 28:23.070]  this bud that I'm holding in my hand right now
[28:23.070 --> 28:24.430]  is probably the size of a golf ball.
[28:24.430 --> 28:25.610]  By the time I'm done playing with it,
[28:25.610 --> 28:28.470]  it's gonna be five or six little tiny bowl-sized buds
[28:28.470 --> 28:30.390]  because there's a stick in the middle of this
[28:30.390 --> 28:34.070]  and nobody wants to buy or carry around a stick.
[28:34.070 --> 28:36.430]  So I'm gonna take, you can hear me just breaking off
[28:36.430 --> 28:37.630]  the buds off the stick right now.
[28:37.630 --> 28:39.110]  Oh, and it looks so much better.
[28:39.110 --> 28:41.030]  Yep, so I think if you,
[28:41.030 --> 28:43.430]  instead of trying to give me big, impressive, fancy buds,
[28:43.430 --> 28:45.430]  give me buds that are well manicured,
[28:45.430 --> 28:47.350]  take them off the stick, take off your crow's feet,
[28:47.350 --> 28:48.510]  take off the handlebars.
[28:48.510 --> 28:50.270]  And when you start looking at your buds when you're trimming,
[28:50.270 --> 28:52.190]  you will know what crow's feet and handlebars are
[28:52.190 --> 28:53.690]  as soon as you see it.
[28:53.690 --> 28:55.510]  And the cabbage leaves at the bottom,
[28:55.510 --> 28:57.230]  that's part of the handlebars and crow's feet,
[28:57.230 --> 28:58.670]  but that cabbage shit at the bottom,
[28:58.670 --> 29:00.310]  take off the cabbage, you guys.
[29:01.130 --> 29:02.270]  Trimmers will know what I'm talking about right away.
[29:02.270 --> 29:03.470]  It'll dawn on you.
[29:03.470 --> 29:06.370]  It's gonna make mediocre weed look like much better weed.
[29:06.370 --> 29:08.950]  It's gonna upgrade your weed that much
[29:08.950 --> 29:11.510]  just by trimming, putting a little bit of effort into it.
[29:11.510 --> 29:13.230]  So also think about something
[29:13.230 --> 29:14.470]  that's called the rule of thumb, you guys.
[29:14.470 --> 29:16.470]  If that bud isn't the size of your thumb,
[29:16.470 --> 29:17.530]  why are you trimming it?
[29:17.530 --> 29:18.830]  You're wasting time.
[29:18.830 --> 29:21.470]  If you're making hash or if you're making edibles,
[29:21.470 --> 29:22.930]  put that into the hash pile.
[29:22.930 --> 29:25.250]  Don't spend 10 minutes trimming a bud
[29:25.250 --> 29:28.350]  that market value would only be worth 50 cents.
[29:29.270 --> 29:30.310]  Don't waste your time on something
[29:30.310 --> 29:32.190]  that's not monetarily worth it.
[29:32.190 --> 29:33.350]  Grab a bigger bud, trim it,
[29:33.350 --> 29:36.470]  throw that other shit in the hash pile and move on.
[29:36.470 --> 29:38.190]  Did I say wear gloves enough times?
[29:38.190 --> 29:41.030]  Wear gloves, please, because I don't want your skin flakes.
[29:41.030 --> 29:42.310]  No matter what you're doing with cannabis,
[29:42.310 --> 29:43.150]  you should wear gloves.
[29:43.150 --> 29:45.470]  If you're touching a plant, you should wear gloves.
[29:45.470 --> 29:47.230]  If you're touching the pot, if you're in the grow,
[29:47.230 --> 29:48.630]  you should probably just put on some gloves.
[29:48.630 --> 29:51.150]  We talked about pesticide contamination.
[29:51.150 --> 29:54.010]  Just wear gloves in the grow, especially when trimming.
[29:54.010 --> 29:57.310]  Don't ever rub your eyes when you're trimming, you guys.
[29:57.310 --> 29:59.270]  It'll only take once.
[29:59.270 --> 30:00.430]  Everybody does it.
[30:00.430 --> 30:02.310]  You'll start trimming and then your eyes will start itching
[30:02.310 --> 30:04.830]  because there's so much just weed smell in the air
[30:04.830 --> 30:06.590]  and everything is sticky and your eye will itch
[30:06.590 --> 30:08.110]  just naturally and you're gonna rub your eye
[30:08.110 --> 30:10.030]  and you're gonna, it'll take about seven seconds
[30:10.030 --> 30:12.710]  before you go, ah, fuck, and you'll know what you just did
[30:12.710 --> 30:13.550]  and it's gonna burn.
[30:13.550 --> 30:14.750]  You're gonna have to quit trimming for a few minutes.
[30:14.750 --> 30:16.030]  Everyone's gonna laugh at you.
[30:16.030 --> 30:16.930]  We know it sucks.
[30:16.930 --> 30:18.550]  You're gonna be okay.
[30:18.550 --> 30:19.930]  Deal with it.
[30:19.930 --> 30:21.350]  All right, you guys, that was 30 minutes.
[30:21.350 --> 30:23.650]  My voice is blown out because I took so many dabs
[30:23.650 --> 30:24.950]  last night at the Dude Grows Cup.
[30:24.950 --> 30:26.350]  I wanna give a huge shout out to everybody
[30:26.350 --> 30:29.130]  that I hung out with, especially the dude and Scotty Real.
[30:29.130 --> 30:30.390]  I had a great time.
[30:30.390 --> 30:33.290]  Right on to Jesse and 44 for hanging out
[30:33.290 --> 30:35.830]  because the people that I had anticipated playing with
[30:35.830 --> 30:37.970]  didn't show up to play, so I had to go play all by myself
[30:37.970 --> 30:38.810]  and make new friends.
[30:38.810 --> 30:39.910]  So it was good that those guys showed up,
[30:39.910 --> 30:41.970]  had somebody to kick it with.
[30:41.970 --> 30:43.530]  I wanna thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[30:43.530 --> 30:45.350]  I put out three episodes last week.
[30:45.350 --> 30:47.070]  I did the normal Monday episode.
[30:47.070 --> 30:49.310]  I did an episode with Lindsey the Traveling Stoner
[30:49.310 --> 30:52.190]  and then I also did the big block of old school episodes.
[30:52.190 --> 30:54.190]  I hope you caught all of those.
[30:54.190 --> 30:55.990]  I wanna remind you again about Patreon.
[30:56.630 --> 30:57.470]  I don't wanna harp on it too much,

[31:46.370 --> 31:48.290]  Go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store,
[31:48.290 --> 31:49.850]  search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[31:49.850 --> 31:51.030]  scroll down to the bottom,
[31:51.030 --> 31:52.690]  click on the part where it's got my ugly face
[31:52.690 --> 31:54.370]  and the red, golden, green logo.
[31:54.370 --> 31:56.090]  In the middle of that page,
[31:56.090 --> 31:57.690]  there will be a ratings and review section.
[31:57.690 --> 32:00.490]  So far, everybody has given me a five star review.
[32:00.490 --> 32:02.210]  I would love it if you give me as many stars
[32:02.210 --> 32:04.690]  as you feel I deserve and then type in a little comment.
[32:04.690 --> 32:07.970]  I will read your review on a future episode.
[32:07.970 --> 32:09.970]  I love reading listener comments.
[32:09.970 --> 32:11.170]  I love the input from the listeners.
[32:11.170 --> 32:13.330]  It was great meeting everybody at the Dude Grows Cup.
[32:13.330 --> 32:16.210]  I was blown away at how many people listened to the podcast.
[32:16.210 --> 32:17.050]  It really blew my mind.
[32:17.050 --> 32:18.530]  I drove home with a big goofy smile.
[32:18.530 --> 32:20.770]  That was partly because I'd had about a million dabs,
[32:20.770 --> 32:24.130]  but that was partly for making so many great friends.
[32:24.130 --> 32:25.650]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can listen to the podcast
[32:25.650 --> 32:27.650]  on iTunes and Stitcher.
[32:27.650 --> 32:29.310]  The episodes are available on my website.
[32:29.310 --> 32:31.030]  I do apologize that my website sucks.
[32:31.030 --> 32:33.210]  I have not put any time into repairing that,
[32:33.210 --> 32:35.370]  updating it, fixing it, making it look good.
[32:35.370 --> 32:37.010]  It's a train wreck right now.
[32:37.010 --> 32:37.890]  Bear with me.
[32:37.890 --> 32:38.770]  The episodes are there.
[32:38.770 --> 32:39.890]  That's all that matters.
[32:39.890 --> 32:41.770]  It probably does me best if you listen to them
[32:41.770 --> 32:42.710]  on iTunes or Stitcher.
[32:42.710 --> 32:44.490]  That's where the numbers count the most to me.
[32:44.490 --> 32:46.870]  But however you're listening, I appreciate it.
[32:46.870 --> 32:47.830]  Please continue to listen.
[32:47.830 --> 32:49.370]  If you've ever got questions, like I said,
[32:49.370 --> 32:50.410]  send them right to me.
[32:50.410 --> 32:51.890]  I will get them answered for you.
[32:51.890 --> 32:53.250]  Because I feel like I am rambling.
[32:53.250 --> 32:54.810]  I hope I improved your trimming.
[32:54.810 --> 32:56.450]  I hope you listen to the Dude Grows podcast
[32:56.450 --> 32:58.830]  and I hope you join me for another episode.
[32:58.830 --> 33:00.170]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my new friends,
[33:00.170 --> 33:01.330]  Jeremy and Cheryl.
[33:01.330 --> 33:02.150]  And until next time,
[33:02.150 --> 33:05.590]  take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.

[38:04.460 --> 38:09.460]  Tonight, I let them be free tonight
[38:11.460 --> 38:16.460]  Tonight, I let them stay free tonight
