[01:51.010 --> 01:53.810]  I had a great long discussion with Mike and Jesse.
[01:53.810 --> 01:56.850]  It starts off with just some random chatter I decided to hit record.
[01:56.850 --> 01:58.590]  I thought I'd leave that in the show.
[01:58.590 --> 02:02.090]  So without further ado, here comes the podcast.
[02:02.090 --> 02:06.330]  So quite a while ago, man, how many years ago was it when we had Med Mart going Mike?
[02:06.330 --> 02:10.370]  Five, four, five, six, somewhere in there.
[02:10.370 --> 02:11.370]  I don't know.
[02:11.370 --> 02:12.370]  Pot.
[02:12.370 --> 02:13.370]  Pot.
[02:13.370 --> 02:14.370]  So pot years ago, between five and eight years ago.
[02:14.370 --> 02:16.730]  It was close to seven or eight years ago possibly by now.
[02:16.730 --> 02:18.210]  I don't remember what year it was.
[02:18.210 --> 02:19.210]  Okay.
[02:19.210 --> 02:20.210]  Oh eight, oh nine.
[02:20.410 --> 02:21.410]  Oh eight.
[02:21.410 --> 02:22.410]  Oh eight.
[02:22.410 --> 02:23.410]  It was oh eight.
[02:23.410 --> 02:24.410]  So it's been six years.
[02:24.410 --> 02:25.410]  So that's six years ago.
[02:25.410 --> 02:28.810]  Mike and I were employed at a dispensary together.
[02:28.810 --> 02:31.010]  I was mostly the dude in charge.
[02:31.010 --> 02:33.410]  I managed, I bud tended, I cleaned.
[02:33.410 --> 02:38.850]  I thought I applied for the job with you and then like I was told you weren't the manager
[02:38.850 --> 02:42.010]  and then you were the, I don't know, that place had structure issues.
[02:42.010 --> 02:43.010]  Right.
[02:43.010 --> 02:44.010]  Yeah.
[02:44.010 --> 02:45.010]  Yeah.
[02:45.010 --> 02:46.010]  That's definitely, I was hired.
[02:46.010 --> 02:48.570]  Well, I was, I was hired as the guy there to help transplant.
[02:48.570 --> 02:53.290]  You kept the place from like wandering away, like the customers from like carrying the
[02:53.290 --> 02:57.770]  furniture off and the employees showing up on time and not stealing everything.
[02:57.770 --> 03:00.410]  There were, there were a lot of chiefs and no Indians.
[03:00.410 --> 03:03.610]  And then one day I talked to the boss and I was like, I was straight up with the boss.
[03:03.610 --> 03:05.330]  I was like, dude, you are a great pot grower.
[03:05.330 --> 03:06.330]  You're a good man.
[03:06.330 --> 03:09.810]  You've got a good business, but honestly you have no idea how to run a damn business.
[03:09.810 --> 03:11.930]  And he kind of laughed at me the way that he did.
[03:11.930 --> 03:13.730]  He's a Southern guy and he's real laid back.
[03:13.730 --> 03:14.970]  So he just chuckled at me.
[03:14.970 --> 03:16.210]  You might be right about that.
[03:16.210 --> 03:17.810]  And he handed me the keys to the shop.
[03:18.050 --> 03:20.610]  And he said, here, you have a dispensary and see what it's like.
[03:20.610 --> 03:23.730]  And so, man, I miss the good old days.
[03:23.730 --> 03:24.730]  Don't you?
[03:24.730 --> 03:28.210]  So from that day, I pretty much had a dispensary and we, we rocked that place.
[03:28.210 --> 03:29.410]  We did.
[03:29.410 --> 03:31.810]  I had days over $10,000 in sales.
[03:31.810 --> 03:35.370]  And one day I think of it as the time I had the best job ever.
[03:35.370 --> 03:36.970]  That was the wild, wild West.
[03:36.970 --> 03:37.970]  It was wonderful.
[03:37.970 --> 03:38.970]  It was, it was crazy.
[03:38.970 --> 03:46.050]  It was definitely the wild West kids coming in with quarter pounds and backpacks and boss
[03:46.050 --> 03:49.650]  handing you three edibles at the beginning of your shift and asking how they tasted four
[03:49.650 --> 03:50.650]  minutes later.
[03:50.650 --> 03:53.210]  Like, yeah, those are two, we got to elaborate on both of those topics.
[03:53.210 --> 03:54.210]  Right.
[03:54.210 --> 03:55.210]  I'm just, it was heaven.
[03:55.210 --> 03:58.130]  People would be at work just serving customers, clean it up.
[03:58.130 --> 03:59.370]  I would have reggae playing.
[03:59.370 --> 04:01.770]  I'd have my laptop on the desk playing music.
[04:01.770 --> 04:02.770]  People would come in.
[04:02.770 --> 04:04.970]  Uh, I'd have a, we'd be smoking a joint.
[04:04.970 --> 04:09.570]  I had a vaporizer set up at the bud bar so that well, to be fair, we usually smoke joints
[04:09.570 --> 04:13.890]  upstairs away from the customer service area, but there was plenty of that downstairs.
[04:13.890 --> 04:17.490]  In the beginning I was reckless and just smoking joints because it was, there were
[04:17.490 --> 04:18.490]  no rules.
[04:18.490 --> 04:19.490]  There were no rules.
[04:19.490 --> 04:21.130]  Everybody had a medical marijuana card.
[04:21.130 --> 04:22.450]  We could be smoking medical marijuana.
[04:22.450 --> 04:24.610]  So there weren't any things to worry about.
[04:24.610 --> 04:25.610]  Right.
[04:25.610 --> 04:28.170]  So we're all in there smoking and customers are coming.
[04:28.170 --> 04:31.330]  People would show up and be like, Hey, do you want to check out this sour diesel that
[04:31.330 --> 04:32.330]  I grew?
[04:32.330 --> 04:33.330]  And be like, I sure do.
[04:33.330 --> 04:34.330]  And then they'd offer it to you.
[04:34.330 --> 04:36.170]  I'll give it to you for this much, a quarter pound.
[04:36.170 --> 04:38.410]  And I'd be like, well, you see what we sell at four and eight.
[04:38.410 --> 04:40.410]  So you got to give me a deal on that.
[04:40.410 --> 04:43.490]  And then we'd get a good price together and we'd start selling that person's quarter
[04:43.490 --> 04:44.490]  pounds.
[04:44.490 --> 04:49.090]  So the good old days, the good old days, Mike would grow a quarter pound and bring it into
[04:49.090 --> 04:52.650]  work and put it on the shelf.
[04:52.650 --> 04:56.530]  Every employee had something on this shelf that they had arranged and had a little profit
[04:56.530 --> 04:57.530]  cut of.
[04:57.530 --> 04:58.530]  I remember that.
[04:58.530 --> 04:59.530]  I remember mine was a little infused candies.
[04:59.530 --> 05:00.530]  Yeah.
[05:00.530 --> 05:03.610]  I have of course had herb on the shelf that I was growing a lot of white rhino and cherry
[05:03.610 --> 05:05.690]  widow was coming from my garden.
[05:05.690 --> 05:10.090]  You'd be able to, so I would take my quarter pound that I grew in my basement and take
[05:10.090 --> 05:15.090]  that to work, sell it to the boss essentially for a specified price.
[05:15.090 --> 05:17.090]  And then get an hourly rate to stand there and sell it.
[05:17.090 --> 05:20.730]  It has to push my product that I just grew so that it'll sell out sooner so that I could
[05:20.730 --> 05:23.730]  bring another quarter pound back to work tomorrow and make a little more bucks.
[05:23.730 --> 05:26.890]  And the boss would come to you at the end of the day and be like, great job.
[05:26.890 --> 05:29.570]  We want more of that from you, bud.
[05:29.570 --> 05:30.570]  Everyone's happy.
[05:30.570 --> 05:31.570]  Yeah.
[05:31.570 --> 05:35.490]  So one of the benefits of having that job was I got to see a lot of cannabis.
[05:35.490 --> 05:39.190]  And one thing I got one day off every week, they made sure to give me, after a while we
[05:39.290 --> 05:40.290]  hired more people.
[05:40.290 --> 05:43.710]  I got two days off a week, but I had one day off a week and I would spend that one day.
[05:43.710 --> 05:48.750]  I would drive to another city and not be the dispensary employee.
[05:48.750 --> 05:52.790]  I would go in as a customer to as many shops as I could and just go do recon work at all
[05:52.790 --> 05:56.630]  these dispensaries and see what they had to offer and see how their shops are set up.
[05:56.630 --> 06:00.110]  See what, who's working there and see what the bud tenders know.
[06:00.110 --> 06:01.590]  Because I wanted, I'm always that guy.
[06:01.590 --> 06:03.790]  If I'm doing something, I want to be really good at it.
[06:03.790 --> 06:05.390]  I want to be the best.
[06:05.390 --> 06:07.590]  So I always go, well, let's see what the best looks like.
[06:07.790 --> 06:11.430]  Let's go try to see what I want to do and also learn what I do not want to do.
[06:11.430 --> 06:15.110]  Because I saw a lot of ways to do it wrong.
[06:15.110 --> 06:18.150]  There was so much shit available.
[06:18.150 --> 06:25.490]  There are some shops that you can smell that musty hay, improperly cured and dried cannabis
[06:25.490 --> 06:27.390]  smell in the waiting room.
[06:27.390 --> 06:29.390]  And you're like, I just want to leave.
[06:29.390 --> 06:32.790]  I can already tell that this is going to be B grade product.
[06:32.790 --> 06:37.390]  I got my feet wet of growing commercial cannabis in one of those places.
[06:40.590 --> 06:46.510]  So how challenging is it to go from being an outdoor grower to being like, I want to
[06:46.510 --> 06:47.230]  call you a caregiver.
[06:47.230 --> 06:50.990]  You're an indoor, they call us basement growers is what we're labeled as.
[06:50.990 --> 06:51.590]  But you know.
[06:51.830 --> 06:53.110]  That's a derogatory term.
[06:53.110 --> 06:53.870]  It kind of is.
[06:53.870 --> 06:56.150]  But if you've got the right basement.
[06:56.950 --> 06:57.450]  Yeah.
[06:57.710 --> 07:01.230]  It's not that you can't be a really awesome, sexy basement grower.
[07:02.190 --> 07:03.550]  It's still sort of a dig.
[07:03.750 --> 07:04.250]  Yeah.
[07:04.470 --> 07:07.470]  I like caregiver, private caregiver, something along those lines.
[07:07.470 --> 07:13.070]  So how were your changes going from being a caregiver in a residential grow to having a
[07:13.070 --> 07:14.350]  gigantic commercial grow?
[07:17.790 --> 07:21.790]  I always say it's on a commercial grow, you're not growing weed.
[07:21.790 --> 07:23.550]  You're managing a schedule.
[07:24.110 --> 07:30.750]  It's more of a plant management, no pun intended, but you're trying to keep all the
[07:30.750 --> 07:33.870]  wheels greased and rolling and functioning properly.
[07:35.390 --> 07:42.190]  And if you start into a grow that didn't have that mindset to begin with, it's quite
[07:42.190 --> 07:42.750]  disastrous.
[07:43.390 --> 07:45.790]  So you had to come in and kind of take over for somebody else.
[07:45.790 --> 07:49.150]  I had to learn that from, I have no college education.
[07:49.150 --> 07:51.470]  You learned that the hard way in the middle of it, huh?
[07:51.470 --> 07:51.970]  Yeah.
[07:52.030 --> 07:52.750]  Yeah, exactly.
[07:53.230 --> 07:54.270]  Trial by fire.
[07:54.270 --> 07:54.770]  Yeah.
[07:55.070 --> 07:55.870]  Sink or swim.
[07:55.870 --> 08:00.830]  And also I got to give you credit because the shop that you were thrown into, they did
[08:00.830 --> 08:03.870]  not provide the proper equipment supplies.
[08:03.870 --> 08:08.910]  No, actually there was one before that, but yeah, no, that one was a joke too.
[08:10.510 --> 08:13.470]  Did you learn a lot from having to deal with the joke at least?
[08:13.470 --> 08:13.970]  Yes.
[08:14.510 --> 08:15.150]  Tremendous.
[08:15.150 --> 08:19.150]  Learning what not to do is just as beneficial as learning what to do.
[08:19.150 --> 08:19.650]  Yeah.
[08:20.530 --> 08:25.250]  Sometimes it helps to figure out why you do it that way by seeing what happens when it's
[08:25.250 --> 08:25.970]  done wrong.
[08:25.970 --> 08:26.370]  Yeah.
[08:26.370 --> 08:27.890]  Some people can only learn that way.
[08:27.890 --> 08:29.570]  I've worked for a few of those people.
[08:29.570 --> 08:31.810]  I mean, just have to stand back and let it crash.
[08:31.810 --> 08:34.210]  I made a completely amateur mistake the other night.
[08:34.930 --> 08:37.650]  I've got a gorilla glue plant and it's growing out of control.
[08:37.650 --> 08:42.130]  So I'm sort of, it's kind of mainlining, but not really because I'm not cleaning everything
[08:42.130 --> 08:42.290]  off.
[08:42.290 --> 08:43.330]  I'm just trying to pull it down.
[08:43.330 --> 08:47.010]  I split that bitch right down the middle, trying to pull one side too far from the other.
[08:47.970 --> 08:50.770]  It's just one piece of duct tape and a twisty tie.
[08:50.770 --> 08:55.890]  It was all happy, but maybe a little clone gel, you know, I thought about it, but I just
[08:55.890 --> 08:58.610]  thought I panicked and was like, I'm just gonna wrap this up now, get out of here.
[08:58.610 --> 09:00.530]  And just quick first aid, split it and go.
[09:00.530 --> 09:01.010]  She's cool.
[09:01.010 --> 09:02.610]  She's happy four or five days later.
[09:02.610 --> 09:03.170]  She's happier.
[09:03.170 --> 09:05.010]  She looks stronger there than she did before.
[09:05.730 --> 09:06.850]  So yeah, they're hardy.
[09:06.850 --> 09:08.050]  I made a super new mistake.
[09:08.770 --> 09:10.370]  So going off, you had something go for it.
[09:10.370 --> 09:12.850]  Oh, I was just going to say, there's a reason they called it weed.
[09:13.490 --> 09:13.890]  Yeah.
[09:13.890 --> 09:16.610]  I mean, it grows like a damn weed if you do it right.
[09:16.770 --> 09:22.050]  Go to all those dispensaries through, I've been to shops from Pueblo, Colorado Springs,
[09:22.770 --> 09:26.930]  Denver, East and West of Denver, both directions.
[09:26.930 --> 09:30.130]  I haven't gotten up to Boulder or Fort Collins to the dispensaries, but it seems like, oh,
[09:30.130 --> 09:32.770]  I have, but you're no shops in Fort Collins.
[09:32.770 --> 09:35.970]  I was up to a couple in Fort Collins before they got killed.
[09:37.250 --> 09:44.690]  A long time back in the battle days again, but they were about like, you'd see everywhere.
[09:44.770 --> 09:50.450]  There are good and bad examples and the good examples range the spectrum from very cultury
[09:50.450 --> 09:54.930]  to very medical officey and so do the bad ones, but I don't know.
[09:54.930 --> 09:55.970]  There's a lot of both.
[09:55.970 --> 09:59.330]  Do you think that the huge regulation has changed the quality and product?
[10:01.570 --> 10:02.450]  Yes and no.
[10:02.450 --> 10:04.370]  I think it hurt and helped it.
[10:06.530 --> 10:11.810]  A lot of the incredible growers couldn't handle the regulation when it first came down
[10:12.530 --> 10:16.370]  and then quality dropped and it stayed kind of down.
[10:17.570 --> 10:23.250]  I don't want to bash it too bad, but quality dip for a while when the best growers were all
[10:23.250 --> 10:28.530]  forced out of the legal industry and it took a while for the people who were great at business
[10:28.530 --> 10:32.290]  and great at following regulations to catch up with making a great product.
[10:35.650 --> 10:40.850]  There were industry leaders for a while and I think now solid product is more common than
[10:41.570 --> 10:46.130]  shady product, but then again, I'm not up at the shops as often as I'd like to be to
[10:46.130 --> 10:47.570]  say this shit with more confidence.
[10:48.450 --> 10:52.850]  One of the things that kind of annoys me, we made all these regulations to prevent shitty
[10:52.850 --> 10:56.050]  weed, pesticides, mildews, problems.
[10:56.050 --> 10:56.530]  Guess what?
[10:56.530 --> 10:57.490]  We're still getting it.
[10:57.490 --> 10:59.890]  They don't go inspect the butt at all.
[10:59.890 --> 11:02.370]  They just pay attention to the dollars and the sales.
[11:02.370 --> 11:04.130]  They don't care about the products or the safety.
[11:04.130 --> 11:08.130]  They check on the edibles and make sure the edibles are the proper dosage, but other than
[11:08.130 --> 11:08.930]  that, they don't really care.
[11:09.490 --> 11:16.770]  There isn't a regulatory system for safety inspections for smokables other than through
[11:16.770 --> 11:19.490]  tobacco and Colorado didn't really have that infrastructure.
[11:20.290 --> 11:24.770]  With the food stuff, kitchen safety and all of those rules are already in place and we
[11:24.770 --> 11:27.410]  saw what happened when those first inspections came out.
[11:28.770 --> 11:30.690]  Everybody at the table kind of smiled and looked at the...
[11:31.490 --> 11:32.210]  Sorry, AJ.
[11:32.210 --> 11:36.050]  I was going to say, they've just recently started enforcing these.
[11:36.050 --> 11:40.290]  We saw AJ at the Secret Cup over the weekend and it's good to see him smiling back on his
[11:40.290 --> 11:40.530]  feet.
[11:40.530 --> 11:41.890]  His little Yoda rig is awesome.
[11:41.890 --> 11:42.610]  What's up, AJ?
[11:42.610 --> 11:43.330]  Good to see you, brother.
[11:43.330 --> 11:44.530]  I hope you listen to the show.
[11:44.530 --> 11:45.730]  AJ Hashman, shout out.
[11:45.730 --> 11:51.810]  Over 100 people got dinged and it's not like they were doing anything that bad or that
[11:51.810 --> 11:52.210]  wrong.
[11:52.210 --> 11:58.690]  It was just their first taste of what the high-end food quality regulations really looked
[11:58.690 --> 12:01.810]  like in a medical edible production kitchen.
[12:01.890 --> 12:06.770]  Even Dixie got hit and they're the ones that are the shiny example in the industry.
[12:09.730 --> 12:14.210]  As the regulations come down, the people that were great at following them have to step
[12:14.210 --> 12:19.570]  up and figure out how to be great at growing weed too because they haven't been practicing
[12:19.570 --> 12:23.090]  for 20 years because they were terrified of breaking the rules.
[12:23.090 --> 12:24.850]  That's why they're good at following them now.
[12:25.090 --> 12:29.170]  That's why you can't find my product on the shelf because they changed all those rules.
[12:29.170 --> 12:31.970]  Yeah, I think when it was all the basement growers and the caregivers doing it in the
[12:31.970 --> 12:32.530]  basement-
[12:32.530 --> 12:33.810]  It got expensive too.
[12:33.810 --> 12:38.210]  Yeah, it did because all the cameras, all the regulations, all that stuff is super expensive.
[12:38.210 --> 12:42.610]  But the big expense to start off is the property.
[12:43.250 --> 12:47.730]  Unless you can find a landlord willing to give Uncle Sam his property to let you live
[12:47.730 --> 12:50.530]  your dream, which thanks, Dad.
[12:50.530 --> 12:52.290]  Other than that, you ain't finding nothing.
[12:52.610 --> 12:53.410]  Thanks, Dad.
[12:53.410 --> 12:55.010]  Other than that, you ain't finding it.
[12:55.730 --> 12:57.330]  So you got to buy the property yourself.
[12:57.330 --> 13:01.090]  And unless you've got a million dollars, you're not owning a retail property in Colorado,
[13:01.090 --> 13:01.330]  sir.
[13:02.690 --> 13:04.210]  Not anywhere other people live anyway.
[13:05.570 --> 13:05.970]  Yeah.
[13:05.970 --> 13:08.290]  Well, I know several people that are on the look for property.
[13:08.290 --> 13:09.330]  There's always that hunt.
[13:10.370 --> 13:11.170]  Raise his hand.
[13:11.890 --> 13:19.090]  From a grower's standpoint too, most dispensary owners are more, at this day and age, are
[13:19.090 --> 13:20.530]  more of a business-minded person.
[13:21.010 --> 13:23.810]  And like you said, know nothing about growing.
[13:24.770 --> 13:27.890]  And they can be incredibly hard to work with from a grower's point of view.
[13:28.610 --> 13:30.130]  You know, I wish I would have learned.
[13:30.130 --> 13:33.490]  I wish I would have gone to business school instead of learning to be a super good pot
[13:33.490 --> 13:34.130]  grower.
[13:34.130 --> 13:35.730]  I went to business school.
[13:35.730 --> 13:38.290]  These regulations are confusing as shit.
[13:38.290 --> 13:38.690]  Oh, yeah.
[13:38.690 --> 13:40.610]  Like, it ain't the lack of schooling.
[13:42.210 --> 13:45.970]  Like, you're better at business than most of the people that I went to DU business school
[13:45.970 --> 13:46.450]  with.
[13:46.450 --> 13:50.290]  And you dropped out of society and went on tour while they went to college.
[13:50.290 --> 13:54.770]  Like, it doesn't have a lot to do with how well you did in business school.
[13:54.770 --> 13:56.530]  I think the life experience was priceless.
[13:57.730 --> 14:02.610]  Right now, following the regulations is really a question of, are you willing to pay your
[14:02.610 --> 14:03.010]  lawyer?
[14:04.770 --> 14:08.290]  You got to have that capital to have that lawyer because the weed lawyers are ridiculous
[14:08.290 --> 14:08.690]  right now.
[14:09.970 --> 14:10.370]  I don't know.
[14:10.370 --> 14:14.130]  It is from my perception, kind of from the outside, because I really don't do a lot of
[14:14.130 --> 14:16.530]  shop shopping or not as much as I'd like.
[14:16.530 --> 14:24.290]  But the really successful shops that have a handful of locations, a reputation for amazing,
[14:24.290 --> 14:31.650]  consistent product are the ones that really invested in a good grower and setting up a
[14:31.650 --> 14:37.090]  grow that that grower can really run and paid the shit out of that lawyer.
[14:37.890 --> 14:38.850]  And their grower.
[14:38.850 --> 14:39.730]  And their grower.
[14:39.730 --> 14:40.770]  They kept them happy.
[14:41.730 --> 14:47.090]  So many shops died because the grower and the business people got in a pissing contest.
[14:47.090 --> 14:50.610]  And rather than succeed, they just peed on each other a bunch.
[14:50.610 --> 14:55.330]  One of the most popular dispensaries in the state does not have their super popular grower
[14:55.330 --> 14:58.690]  and grow team anymore because of recent political changes they chose to make.
[15:00.690 --> 15:03.330]  I won't call out any names, but yeah, that was a terrible breakup.
[15:03.330 --> 15:07.170]  I was kind of sad to see that, but it did make for some great new opportunities.
[15:07.890 --> 15:08.130]  Right.
[15:09.330 --> 15:10.370]  Onward and upward.
[15:10.370 --> 15:11.090]  That's it.
[15:11.090 --> 15:13.410]  Speaking of onward and upward, my mic sounds all echoey.
[15:13.410 --> 15:14.370]  Do you guys hear that in the headphones?
[15:14.370 --> 15:15.570]  Am I echoey to you too?
[15:15.570 --> 15:15.970]  Yeah.
[15:15.970 --> 15:16.210]  Yeah.
[15:16.210 --> 15:16.930]  Tiny bit.
[15:16.930 --> 15:17.810]  Is it this?
[15:17.810 --> 15:18.530]  Does that fix it?
[15:19.170 --> 15:19.410]  Okay.
[15:19.410 --> 15:21.410]  It's because I got your mic turned up real high.
[15:21.410 --> 15:21.970]  There you go.
[15:21.970 --> 15:22.530]  All right.
[15:22.530 --> 15:22.930]  Cool.
[15:22.930 --> 15:24.370]  I'm learning how to work sound equipment.
[15:24.370 --> 15:25.810]  It only took me 34 episodes.
[15:27.330 --> 15:27.650]  All right.
[15:27.650 --> 15:28.690]  I may edit part of that out.
[15:29.250 --> 15:33.170]  So the reason that Mike, actually Mike and Jesse have been contacting me,
[15:33.170 --> 15:35.090]  talking to me about this topic.
[15:35.090 --> 15:36.610]  I was sleeping on this.
[15:36.610 --> 15:40.210]  Mike, thankfully is a super active member of our community.
[15:40.210 --> 15:41.570]  He goes to city council meetings.
[15:41.570 --> 15:43.330]  He supports cannabis any way that he can.
[15:43.890 --> 15:47.970]  Jesse works at a hydro shop and try and is also a farmer, a grower,
[15:47.970 --> 15:51.170]  and tries to do what he can to stay up on politics.
[15:53.090 --> 15:55.250]  I don't pay attention to the local news to tell you the truth.
[15:55.250 --> 15:58.610]  I just pay attention to the world and national cannabis news and the state news.
[15:58.610 --> 16:02.050]  So luckily Mike brought this to my attention and Jesse had some stuff to add to it.
[16:02.050 --> 16:05.330]  I put these guys in touch and then they were like, we got to get on the podcast tonight.
[16:05.330 --> 16:06.930]  So it was their idea to do a show about this.
[16:06.930 --> 16:08.290]  So big shout out to these guys.
[16:08.290 --> 16:09.890]  Thank you guys for giving me material.
[16:09.890 --> 16:10.050]  Yeah.
[16:10.930 --> 16:11.570]  Thank you, Mike.
[16:12.210 --> 16:12.370]  Yeah.
[16:13.970 --> 16:14.210]  I don't know.
[16:14.210 --> 16:15.650]  What should I just start telling the story?
[16:15.650 --> 16:19.730]  I kind of took some notes and I've got a little opening, an opening statement, if you will.
[16:19.730 --> 16:23.330]  It says states, let me try that again without a frog in my throat.
[16:23.330 --> 16:26.690]  It says city staff is attempting to draft a new ordinance
[16:26.690 --> 16:29.490]  that would ban all indoor growing in the city of Pueblo.
[16:29.490 --> 16:32.610]  They want to make the rules that say they want to make rules that say
[16:32.610 --> 16:35.490]  we have to grow in a separate building detached from our house.
[16:35.490 --> 16:38.290]  And that is bullshit because of many reasons.
[16:38.290 --> 16:39.410]  Is that pretty accurate?
[16:39.410 --> 16:40.050]  What I wrote there?
[16:41.090 --> 16:41.810]  Yeah.
[16:41.810 --> 16:42.130]  Cool.
[16:43.010 --> 16:46.850]  Not just indoor home growing though, all home growing.
[16:46.850 --> 16:50.050]  So green, no greenhouse in your backyard.
[16:50.050 --> 16:52.210]  No, just out in your backyard.
[16:53.090 --> 16:54.530]  No, in your basement.
[16:54.530 --> 16:55.810]  No, in your bedroom.
[16:55.810 --> 17:01.650]  No little grow cabinet, which means everything at your local hydro store
[17:01.650 --> 17:06.530]  is pretty much pointless because you can't use any of it unless you build
[17:07.170 --> 17:11.890]  a special outbuilding just for your six personal cannabis plants.
[17:12.930 --> 17:14.130]  Which is ridiculous.
[17:14.130 --> 17:18.130]  How many of us can afford to build a special outbuilding just for our cannabis plants?
[17:18.130 --> 17:19.170]  I have six of them.
[17:19.170 --> 17:25.090]  The hot topic in the chieftain the last couple of weeks has been revolving around
[17:25.650 --> 17:27.890]  most people in this, well, not most people in the city,
[17:27.890 --> 17:30.610]  several people in the city not being able to afford trash service.
[17:31.650 --> 17:34.050]  Electricity payments, things like this.
[17:34.050 --> 17:40.370]  And we're talking about having people build a special airtight smell proof building
[17:41.010 --> 17:43.650]  so they can grow six pot plants.
[17:43.650 --> 17:47.490]  Well, technically three, because you're only allowed three in bloom at one time.
[17:48.130 --> 17:52.530]  So you'd only have three stinky flowering plants in that building ever at once.
[17:52.530 --> 17:54.450]  This would also affect caregivers.
[17:54.450 --> 17:58.530]  He's using a 64 as reference, but it would also affect caregivers.
[17:58.530 --> 17:59.090]  Thank you.
[17:59.090 --> 18:00.450]  So it would just be...
[18:02.450 --> 18:04.290]  It would affect everybody in the city.
[18:04.290 --> 18:04.770]  Outside.
[18:04.770 --> 18:05.570]  So you can't do it.
[18:05.570 --> 18:07.330]  Isn't that going to make it easier to steal?
[18:07.330 --> 18:08.450]  Harder to take care of?
[18:08.450 --> 18:09.650]  It's going to be another building.
[18:09.650 --> 18:11.410]  You're going to have to get a building permit.
[18:11.410 --> 18:12.770]  You're going to need to wire that building.
[18:13.650 --> 18:18.530]  Well, everybody in the neighborhood would know that that's why the six people on the block
[18:18.530 --> 18:22.290]  or in the neighborhood or whatever just built that special new building behind their house.
[18:22.290 --> 18:24.210]  You'd have to own your said property.
[18:25.010 --> 18:30.210]  It's the first place my mind went is it's a huge kick to Black Hills because everybody
[18:30.210 --> 18:35.570]  who's been using a greenhouse or following the very letter of the law and just chain
[18:35.570 --> 18:41.010]  linking their plants into a cage and essentially growing them purely outdoors in their backyard,
[18:41.010 --> 18:43.250]  but in an enclosed locked space.
[18:43.890 --> 18:50.850]  Now you've got to put them under expensive grow lights with fancy air filtration equipment
[18:50.850 --> 18:53.490]  and all of that's just a huge give to Black Hills.
[18:54.290 --> 18:57.570]  Now you said that you had an idea of why this ordinance was being drafted.
[18:58.850 --> 19:03.570]  So a couple of weeks ago, and I'm the city council policy nerd.
[19:03.570 --> 19:05.730]  I go attend just about every meeting.
[19:06.850 --> 19:13.410]  I was there two weeks ago listening to the interviews for the new city council seat and
[19:13.410 --> 19:16.050]  then for the budgetary meeting they had after that.
[19:16.930 --> 19:21.650]  And during the budgetary meeting, just sort of offhandedly, a couple of the council members
[19:21.650 --> 19:27.650]  referenced a complaint they had all received the previous week from a homeowner on the
[19:27.650 --> 19:32.690]  south side who's an elderly gentleman and wakes up every day to the stink of marijuana
[19:32.690 --> 19:33.090]  plants.
[19:33.810 --> 19:37.970]  And now everybody's sitting at this table is like, you asked, why'd you say stink?
[19:37.970 --> 19:40.210]  Well, it's because that's how this old guy sees it.
[19:40.210 --> 19:45.410]  And that's what he called city council about and being city council and not having a whole
[19:45.410 --> 19:52.530]  lot to do other than please your constituents and respond to stuff like this.
[19:52.530 --> 19:56.930]  A number of them drove out to this guy's house and gave it a smell.
[19:57.810 --> 20:03.810]  And Sandy Daff said it was a very strong from the driveway.
[20:03.810 --> 20:05.490]  She pulled up into this gentleman's house.
[20:05.490 --> 20:08.770]  So next she pulls up next door and she can smell this guy's garden.
[20:09.890 --> 20:14.530]  Steve Narocki said that he didn't really smell it, but when he was standing in the backyard,
[20:14.530 --> 20:17.810]  he could clearly see several plants over the top of a privacy fence.
[20:18.370 --> 20:22.690]  So, you know, it gives you an idea how big this caregiver was doing in his backyard.
[20:22.690 --> 20:26.930]  And it doesn't sound like he's meeting all of the basic city code stuff because they
[20:26.930 --> 20:28.450]  weren't enclosed or locked.
[20:28.450 --> 20:29.810]  They were just in his backyard.
[20:30.610 --> 20:33.730]  But the cops have been out at this guy's house.
[20:33.730 --> 20:35.410]  His neighbors are pissed.
[20:35.410 --> 20:38.050]  Like would any of you ever stink out your neighbors like this?
[20:41.490 --> 20:43.730]  It's a pretty easy way to bring problems on yourself.
[20:44.370 --> 20:47.330]  I would be embarrassed if my neighbors smelled me every morning.
[20:47.330 --> 20:49.330]  As an indoor grower, I try to be really covert.
[20:49.330 --> 20:53.410]  My neighbors, I'm certain my neighbors know what I do because they've seen me carrying things.
[20:53.410 --> 20:54.530]  They see my dreadlocks.
[20:54.530 --> 20:55.330]  They know who I am.
[20:56.050 --> 20:57.170]  They've seen my Facebook.
[20:57.170 --> 20:58.770]  They probably listen to the podcast.
[21:00.130 --> 21:01.650]  One of my neighbors was a vendor.
[21:01.650 --> 21:07.650]  I don't know what he sold exactly, but he brought me a large box of lighters, fresh lighters.
[21:07.650 --> 21:09.730]  Like just he's like, I'm pretty sure you guys smoke.
[21:09.730 --> 21:10.850]  You want some lighters?
[21:10.850 --> 21:14.050]  And that big gigantic box over there is that's all lighters, dude.
[21:14.050 --> 21:14.850]  I'm serious.
[21:14.850 --> 21:19.330]  So my neighbors know what's up, but I still, I don't, I try to keep it on the down low.
[21:19.330 --> 21:23.890]  They're not calling city council on you saying you're a bad neighbor because they don't wake
[21:23.890 --> 21:24.290]  up.
[21:24.290 --> 21:25.570]  Like I would be mortified.
[21:25.570 --> 21:28.690]  Like clearly my mother did not raise whoever's growing these pot plants.
[21:28.690 --> 21:33.890]  But you know, so city council went out there and during the meeting the other night, they
[21:33.890 --> 21:38.930]  mentioned sort of offhandedly that they had all received this complaint and they all agreed
[21:38.930 --> 21:42.930]  that this guy should be able to wake up in the morning and not smell his neighbor's pot
[21:42.930 --> 21:43.410]  plants.
[21:44.210 --> 21:46.210]  And they didn't really say anything else about it.
[21:46.210 --> 21:50.690]  They kind of chuckled about the smell and contact high got thrown around a little bit.
[21:50.690 --> 21:52.450]  And then they went on to, they were busy.
[21:52.450 --> 21:55.570]  They were going over budgetary stuff and the city's millions of dollars in the hole.
[21:56.210 --> 21:58.130]  So it got dropped pretty quick.
[21:58.930 --> 22:04.050]  And, um, you know, being who I am and doing what I do all day, when I read the article
[22:04.050 --> 22:11.490]  in the Chieftain today, I called every city council member in Pueblo and three of them
[22:11.490 --> 22:14.370]  called me back today and discuss this issue.
[22:14.370 --> 22:19.410]  And all of them said that this isn't something that they asked for, or that they're aware
[22:19.410 --> 22:25.170]  that any other council person asked for rather it's something the city staff has put together
[22:25.810 --> 22:31.490]  based on those offhanded comments, the council meeting the other night.
[22:31.490 --> 22:36.210]  So this is all the brainchild of somebody in planning and zoning who's attempting to
[22:36.210 --> 22:43.330]  please his bosses who might not, or whom he decided might want to weed, can't smell weed
[22:43.330 --> 22:44.690]  in Pueblo type ordinance.
[22:45.970 --> 22:51.170]  The city council people I talked to all use the word unenforceable or all agreed that
[22:51.170 --> 22:56.370]  any sort of ordinance that covered growing pot in a basement or in a garage, like all
[22:56.370 --> 22:57.570]  of that is unenforceable.
[22:57.570 --> 23:00.210]  They can't send somebody to every house in Pueblo and check.
[23:00.770 --> 23:05.010]  So essentially, if you're not being a jerk and stinking up your neighbor to begin with,
[23:05.570 --> 23:08.770]  there'd be no way for them to find you making this totally pointless.
[23:08.770 --> 23:14.850]  So I don't see it really going anywhere, but regardless, everybody who gives a shit needs
[23:14.850 --> 23:22.370]  to show up on the 13th at 7 p.m. at the city council building down on Union and Grand.
[23:23.010 --> 23:23.970]  You're the city council guy.
[23:23.970 --> 23:24.690]  You should be telling me.
[23:24.690 --> 23:25.970]  Don't look at me with a question mark.
[23:25.970 --> 23:28.450]  I drive there without thinking at this point.
[23:28.450 --> 23:29.650]  Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Union and Grand.
[23:29.650 --> 23:31.330]  I will tweet the correct address.
[23:31.330 --> 23:36.050]  What Mike is saying, guys, we want to go on October 13th to city council and tell them
[23:36.050 --> 23:39.970]  that this proposed idea is unacceptable and that it will not work for us.
[23:40.770 --> 23:44.370]  While you were talking, I came up with an alternative, a cannabis courtesy law.
[23:45.170 --> 23:46.610]  It's like a don't ask, don't tell.
[23:46.610 --> 23:48.610]  But if we can smell it, you got to turn it down.
[23:49.330 --> 23:50.530]  That's a cannabis courtesy.
[23:52.690 --> 23:56.850]  I'd like to see more of a public service announcement that's like, don't be a fucking
[23:56.850 --> 23:57.570]  asshole.
[23:57.570 --> 23:58.850]  Yeah, I agree with that.
[23:59.330 --> 23:59.890]  You can say that.
[23:59.890 --> 24:01.010]  I'm not charging you a dollar.
[24:02.610 --> 24:03.890]  It's a common courtesy thing.
[24:03.890 --> 24:06.690]  I would be mortified is the word I would use to describe it.
[24:06.690 --> 24:08.850]  Not embarrassed, not ashamed, fucking mortified.
[24:08.850 --> 24:13.810]  If my neighbor smelled me every morning and if you're growing 30 or 40 cannabis plants
[24:13.810 --> 24:18.530]  as a caregiver, you're putting yourself at risk, your patient's medicine at risk.
[24:18.530 --> 24:21.330]  Just having that wafting down the alley.
[24:22.610 --> 24:26.290]  We already had one kid get shot in the stomach with an air rifle this summer because someone's
[24:26.290 --> 24:28.130]  too stupid to put their shit in a fence.
[24:29.650 --> 24:32.530]  If you throw a chain link fence over it, teenagers aren't going to bother.
[24:32.530 --> 24:35.570]  They can barely work scissors, let alone freaking wire cutters.
[24:35.570 --> 24:38.690]  Most of them are so lazy that they're not ready to steal unless it's right in their
[24:38.690 --> 24:39.650]  face anyway.
[24:39.650 --> 24:40.370]  Right.
[24:40.370 --> 24:43.170]  If you're growing in town, don't push the limits.
[24:44.130 --> 24:46.050]  I think that's the thing we're getting at.
[24:47.570 --> 24:51.330]  All of this is because one guy's being inconsiderate.
[24:51.330 --> 24:51.970]  Yes.
[24:51.970 --> 24:53.490]  Yeah, so we're all going to get punished for that.
[24:53.490 --> 24:54.370]  That kind of sucks.
[24:54.370 --> 24:58.610]  Everybody who would like to grow their own cannabis plants in the city of Pueblo now
[24:58.610 --> 25:04.530]  has that right in jeopardy because one jerk on the South side is stinking up his neighbor's
[25:04.530 --> 25:05.090]  house.
[25:05.090 --> 25:08.370]  Two jerks because somebody had to shoot somebody also, and I'm sure that contributes.
[25:09.010 --> 25:10.850]  That's surely not helping anybody.
[25:11.730 --> 25:15.490]  And there's another jerk out in the county.
[25:16.370 --> 25:23.570]  I almost said too much of the neighborhood, but he's the main thing for the county kind
[25:23.570 --> 25:26.930]  of doing the same thing that they're wanting to do the same thing that the city is going
[25:26.930 --> 25:28.130]  to do or try to do.
[25:28.130 --> 25:30.450]  Now, the county is talking about proposed plant limits.
[25:30.450 --> 25:31.490]  Is that right?
[25:31.490 --> 25:38.210]  They are talking limits, but regardless of caregiver ship or anything like that, it would
[25:38.210 --> 25:38.370]  be.
[25:41.810 --> 25:42.610]  Shit, I can't remember.
[25:42.610 --> 25:43.810]  18 plants.
[25:43.810 --> 25:44.050]  Yeah.
[25:44.850 --> 25:51.330]  18 plants per single family residence, 12 plants per apartment or multi-family residence.
[25:52.130 --> 25:56.930]  Um, and it, uh, limits, uh, or forbids outdoor growing too.
[25:56.930 --> 26:00.930]  So that's, you know, that's ridiculous, especially in the county.
[26:00.930 --> 26:06.290]  The forbidding of outdoor growing is just a silly gift to black Hills that they don't
[26:06.290 --> 26:06.690]  deserve.
[26:07.410 --> 26:07.910]  Yeah.
[26:08.850 --> 26:13.570]  The sun is free, abundant energy and plants are meant to be outdoors.
[26:13.570 --> 26:17.570]  And the only reason marijuana was forced indoors to begin with was prohibition.
[26:18.370 --> 26:21.570]  Um, I don't know about you guys, but I love some summer outdoor.
[26:21.570 --> 26:22.210]  Yeah, man.
[26:22.210 --> 26:25.410]  You say a lot of ridiculous shit, but that thing you just said about the only reason
[26:25.410 --> 26:28.690]  marijuana was forced indoors was because of prohibition is one of the greatest things
[26:28.690 --> 26:29.570]  I've ever heard you say.
[26:30.210 --> 26:33.730]  Every now and then a diamond falls out along with all the coal.
[26:33.730 --> 26:34.130]  Yeah, dude.
[26:34.130 --> 26:34.290]  Yeah.
[26:34.290 --> 26:37.010]  You're, you're kind of full of crap, but once in a while you spit out a real gem.
[26:37.570 --> 26:38.850]  That was, and I agree with you.
[26:38.850 --> 26:43.330]  And a lot of people moved to Colorado to the Pueblo area to grow outdoors because this
[26:43.330 --> 26:44.530]  is an ideal climate.
[26:45.490 --> 26:50.050]  There's a reason that, uh, most of the army, uh, troops that have been to Afghanistan and
[26:50.050 --> 26:53.810]  Iraq, uh, go through Fort Carson for training before they go there.
[26:53.810 --> 26:54.370]  Yeah.
[26:54.370 --> 26:56.690]  It gets them acclimated to the similar environment.
[26:56.690 --> 26:57.650]  We're up this altitude.
[26:57.650 --> 26:58.210]  The air is thin.
[26:58.210 --> 26:59.490]  The temperature is the same.
[26:59.490 --> 26:59.810]  Yeah.
[26:59.810 --> 27:01.490]  The Hindu Kush Valley.
[27:01.490 --> 27:04.690]  Does that mean that when, uh, when they take over and they all come here, that they're
[27:04.690 --> 27:05.730]  coming to Pueblo?
[27:05.730 --> 27:06.230]  Shit.
[27:07.810 --> 27:10.690]  Colorado is my favorite place on the planet before we legalized.
[27:11.570 --> 27:12.610]  It gets beautiful here.
[27:12.610 --> 27:13.730]  The weather's gorgeous.
[27:13.730 --> 27:15.250]  The climate's wonderful.
[27:15.250 --> 27:16.690]  The summers are amazing.
[27:16.690 --> 27:18.050]  The food here is great.
[27:18.850 --> 27:21.330]  The late, the sweet corn people, you don't know what you're missing.
[27:21.330 --> 27:23.330]  The people are great in Colorado, right?
[27:23.330 --> 27:24.610]  People are pretty chill.
[27:24.610 --> 27:28.370]  When family comes to visit, they always comment on how nice the drivers are.
[27:29.490 --> 27:35.410]  We'll be driving up the highway and 30 people will shift it lanes all in unison to let a
[27:35.410 --> 27:38.050]  semi who's slow up the on-ramp on.
[27:38.050 --> 27:40.850]  And the dude from New York will go, what the fuck was down, man?
[27:41.570 --> 27:42.850]  What are you guys doing?
[27:42.850 --> 27:44.850]  We're not being dicks in unison.
[27:44.850 --> 27:46.050]  Isn't it amazing?
[27:46.050 --> 27:48.450]  We didn't have to orchestrate or communicate or nothing.
[27:48.450 --> 27:50.930]  We just all weren't dicks at the same time.
[27:50.930 --> 27:53.490]  Somebody was telling me a story about the cannabis cup.
[27:53.490 --> 27:55.650]  Another person was in from out of state.
[27:55.650 --> 27:58.530]  I think New York, somewhere upstate where they talked all crazy.
[27:58.530 --> 27:59.570]  They spoke all crazy.
[28:00.610 --> 28:04.530]  But she said, the friend that told me the story said he was walking up and down the
[28:04.530 --> 28:05.650]  aisles going, I can't believe it.
[28:05.650 --> 28:06.850]  Y'all is so nice here.
[28:06.850 --> 28:09.170]  People is so nice and we can smoke weed.
[28:09.810 --> 28:12.850]  He just didn't believe how friendly and polite Colorado people are.
[28:14.050 --> 28:17.730]  One of the things I've seen the internet a lot is people looking to come here and check
[28:17.730 --> 28:22.530]  out our legal weed scene, worried they're going to be embarrassed and cause problems
[28:22.530 --> 28:24.770]  or get grief from locals.
[28:24.770 --> 28:29.650]  If they come here and get excited about legal weed, no, live it the fuck up.
[28:29.650 --> 28:30.930]  It's paradise here.
[28:30.930 --> 28:33.090]  We kind of know where the cool kid, you know what I mean?
[28:33.090 --> 28:34.210]  We're like, we know you want to hang out.
[28:34.210 --> 28:35.330]  Come on, we'll let you in our group.
[28:36.210 --> 28:37.090]  We're not exclusive.
[28:37.090 --> 28:38.130]  We're not celebrities.
[28:38.130 --> 28:38.930]  We're just potheads.
[28:39.810 --> 28:42.530]  Jeff was with me in line on January 1st.
[28:43.410 --> 28:45.730]  Did you do much shopping the second time?
[28:45.730 --> 28:46.930]  Yeah, that was my second round.
[28:47.650 --> 28:48.530]  Did you do much?
[28:48.530 --> 28:50.130]  Were you at the shop all day on the first?
[28:50.130 --> 28:51.890]  No, I didn't work in the front at all.
[28:51.890 --> 28:52.690]  The first thing.
[28:52.690 --> 28:55.090]  God, well, I've seen it.
[28:55.090 --> 28:59.970]  I saw it working at a dispensary back in the good old days, but on the first watching people
[28:59.970 --> 29:05.170]  make their first legal weed purchase and do the, I've got legal weed.
[29:05.170 --> 29:05.730]  Oh my God.
[29:05.730 --> 29:06.370]  Oh my God.
[29:06.370 --> 29:06.690]  Shuffle.
[29:06.690 --> 29:07.810]  That's just how I think of it.
[29:08.690 --> 29:09.890]  It's more than a strut.
[29:09.890 --> 29:11.410]  It's more than a glide.
[29:11.410 --> 29:14.690]  It's like a bounce kind of ticker walks like this.
[29:16.850 --> 29:19.810]  It didn't matter if it was a gram or an ounce.
[29:19.810 --> 29:23.010]  There's just the feeling of freedom and freedom.
[29:23.810 --> 29:25.810]  No one can take this away from you.
[29:25.810 --> 29:27.010]  It's magical.
[29:27.010 --> 29:27.970]  Come enjoy it.
[29:28.530 --> 29:30.050]  Just don't Marine doubt yourself.
[29:30.770 --> 29:31.890]  That's all we ask.
[29:31.890 --> 29:33.010]  It has become a verb.
[29:34.370 --> 29:35.410]  It's so dumb.
[29:35.410 --> 29:37.170]  It became a verb instantly.
[29:38.130 --> 29:40.290]  I was actually, I don't know if I've said this on this show.
[29:40.290 --> 29:43.970]  I was the first person to buy recreational cannabis at the greener side dispensary in
[29:43.970 --> 29:46.930]  Pueblo, Colorado, Pueblo County.
[29:48.290 --> 29:51.890]  They claim that that dude in Pueblo West beat me, but I don't care.
[29:51.890 --> 29:53.730]  No, that's just where the news was.
[29:53.730 --> 29:57.490]  They did the same thing in Denver with the vet being the first person.
[29:57.490 --> 29:58.130]  The first person.
[29:58.130 --> 29:58.290]  Right.
[29:58.290 --> 30:02.770]  And I walk out the door and there's a camera crew sitting there and they're like, say something
[30:02.770 --> 30:05.490]  and being, you know, I've got always got shit to say.
[30:05.490 --> 30:08.690]  So I was like, my name is Rasta Jeff and I was the first person to buy recreational
[30:08.690 --> 30:10.930]  cannabis at the greener side dispensary in Pueblo, Colorado.
[30:10.930 --> 30:11.730]  And then I screamed.
[30:11.730 --> 30:14.690]  Yeah, I have no idea where that video went.
[30:14.690 --> 30:15.730]  I'd love to see that.
[30:15.730 --> 30:17.970]  It's on somebody's documentary somewhere.
[30:17.970 --> 30:19.970]  I would love to see where that went.
[30:21.330 --> 30:24.290]  I had some pictures on my old phone that went for a swim.
[30:24.290 --> 30:29.570]  You sent me the great one of my best Instagram and Twitter photos ever came was actually
[30:29.570 --> 30:34.290]  taken by our friend, Jesse, the one where the reporter is filming me and interviewing
[30:34.290 --> 30:34.530]  me.
[30:34.530 --> 30:39.570]  And then our buddy Walter is standing there looking like a photo was taken by you.
[30:39.570 --> 30:40.850]  Actually, it's a great shot.
[30:41.650 --> 30:43.490]  Yeah, no, that was a really cool day.
[30:43.490 --> 30:45.010]  That was a real, that's a memorable day.
[30:45.010 --> 30:47.730]  I remember a lot of stuff from that day for sure.
[30:47.730 --> 30:49.650]  Oh, I forgot a lot of stuff from that day too.
[30:51.650 --> 30:56.130]  So I was first, I bought weed first and then I came home and met up with my buddy that
[30:56.130 --> 31:00.130]  I did another podcast with back in the day and him and I went back out there and took
[31:00.130 --> 31:03.410]  our recording devices and went and had a little bit of fun out there for that.
[31:03.410 --> 31:07.490]  And by then I was already well known as the first guy that bought pot.
[31:07.490 --> 31:09.090]  I don't know how everybody knew already.
[31:09.090 --> 31:10.690]  It'd only been three or four hours.
[31:10.690 --> 31:12.530]  There wasn't a lot to talk about in that line.
[31:12.530 --> 31:19.250]  So the news actually came to my house and filmed us, Mike and I and another friend here
[31:19.250 --> 31:22.050]  hanging out smoking and put that on the news.
[31:22.050 --> 31:28.610]  Yeah, I got a little overexcited with my first legal weed purchase as just an adult and yeah,
[31:28.610 --> 31:29.570]  that was fun.
[31:29.650 --> 31:35.170]  I'm glad that they were way more fascinated with the dreadlocks and the dab rig than they
[31:35.170 --> 31:37.490]  were with the pasty white guy in the corner.
[31:38.370 --> 31:43.250]  I took two or three dabs when the camera crew was here and they put the tiny shitty weak
[31:43.250 --> 31:44.450]  dab on the news.
[31:44.450 --> 31:45.330]  Oh yeah.
[31:45.330 --> 31:48.370]  I was like, oh, you could have put a real fat dab on the news.
[31:48.370 --> 31:51.170]  If I remember right, they didn't even actually put the whole dab on either.
[31:51.170 --> 31:51.730]  No, no.
[31:51.730 --> 31:54.610]  Yeah, it was just me blowing it out I think.
[31:54.610 --> 31:57.010]  By then the camera guy was a little lit.
[31:57.650 --> 31:59.810]  It wasn't his fault.
[31:59.810 --> 32:03.410]  We got carried away and sort of hot box this room real fast.
[32:04.850 --> 32:10.210]  There was a reporter expecting it, a video camera guy and a still camera lady and the
[32:10.210 --> 32:13.730]  still camera lady was talking about how she wished she could smoke, but they drug test
[32:13.730 --> 32:13.890]  her.
[32:13.890 --> 32:18.450]  So I was making sure to blow a little smoke right in her face.
[32:18.450 --> 32:21.970]  You know, they did a beat fucking straight to Wendy's when they left here.
[32:21.970 --> 32:27.170]  The reporter lady, she started off like next to me asking questions like, so tell me about
[32:27.170 --> 32:27.410]  this.
[32:27.410 --> 32:28.210]  Tell me about this.
[32:28.770 --> 32:30.930]  She finished her report from the middle of the living room.
[32:30.930 --> 32:34.930]  She was gone and she went all the way out of the room yelling questions.
[32:34.930 --> 32:36.930]  She had the front door open getting air and shit.
[32:36.930 --> 32:38.530]  And tell me more about cannabis.
[32:38.530 --> 32:39.330]  It was so funny.
[32:40.530 --> 32:45.490]  I see her every other week at council meetings and she's always a real sweetheart and tries
[32:45.490 --> 32:49.890]  to block me out of her shot of whoever's speaking just by fate lines us up.
[32:50.450 --> 32:54.450]  If she wanted to, she could tip her camera up a degree and a half and have my dumb mug
[32:54.450 --> 32:57.970]  in every background shot, but she cuts me out and I appreciate it.
[32:57.970 --> 32:58.130]  Yeah.
[32:58.130 --> 33:01.010]  Well, you've been seen as the guy smoking bud here at the house.
[33:01.010 --> 33:02.850]  You don't need to be the guy on city council.
[33:02.850 --> 33:04.050]  Also, that'll look weird.
[33:04.050 --> 33:04.530]  Yeah.
[33:04.530 --> 33:06.530]  I wish they'd wear a lot of hats.
[33:06.530 --> 33:07.810]  I wish they would do that.
[33:07.810 --> 33:08.770]  He's our lobbyist.
[33:09.970 --> 33:11.330]  He's doing well for us.
[33:11.330 --> 33:13.410]  He's the one that got this important news on the air.
[33:13.410 --> 33:14.690]  I cleans up real good.
[33:14.690 --> 33:15.010]  Yeah.
[33:15.010 --> 33:19.570]  This whole, this all started when a reporter from the chief sent me an email, how he got
[33:19.570 --> 33:20.130]  my email.
[33:20.130 --> 33:25.810]  I have no earthly idea, but I woke up to, can you please find us someone from the cannabis
[33:25.810 --> 33:32.370]  using community that wants to comment on the city council attempting to ban all home growing?
[33:32.930 --> 33:35.410]  And I went, wait, what?
[33:36.530 --> 33:37.570]  That's news to me.
[33:37.570 --> 33:42.290]  And yeah, it seems like, well, yeah, the story we just told a little stone.
[33:42.290 --> 33:43.650]  So I'm kind of backtracking.
[33:43.650 --> 33:44.210]  But no, that's cool.
[33:44.210 --> 33:48.930]  We need to remind the people that what's going to happen is the draft will be presented on
[33:48.930 --> 33:51.090]  October 15th to the city council.
[33:51.090 --> 33:55.250]  What we've got to do is go to the city council meeting on the 13th and kind of be preemptive.
[33:55.250 --> 33:57.090]  Show them, look, we know this is coming.
[33:57.090 --> 33:58.610]  We're here to influence you first.
[33:59.730 --> 34:01.650]  Come up with good reasons why it's bullshit.
[34:01.650 --> 34:04.850]  And if you have, if you've got a speaking voice, if you're not scared to speak in front
[34:04.850 --> 34:06.770]  of people, go speak to the city council.
[34:07.410 --> 34:08.290]  It's a public forum.
[34:08.290 --> 34:12.770]  Explain to them that they can't make us grow in private buildings because first that tells
[34:12.770 --> 34:14.210]  the robbers right where our weed is.
[34:14.770 --> 34:17.890]  Second, that tells your neighbors that you are actually growing cannabis if they didn't
[34:17.890 --> 34:18.370]  already know.
[34:19.010 --> 34:23.250]  Third, you can't afford a damn building for that's going to make more electricity for
[34:23.250 --> 34:24.610]  Black Hills to go wire up.
[34:24.610 --> 34:25.810]  That should be number one.
[34:25.810 --> 34:26.310]  Okay.
[34:27.090 --> 34:28.690]  See all these reasons already add up.
[34:28.690 --> 34:30.690]  Second of all, what are we doing wrong?
[34:31.250 --> 34:33.170]  There's a couple of people screwing up.
[34:33.170 --> 34:33.570]  Right.
[34:33.570 --> 34:35.170]  Go make those people correct their things.
[34:35.170 --> 34:37.650]  Don't punish the whole group for a couple of people screw ups.
[34:37.650 --> 34:42.450]  This does nothing to go over the act or try to attack the actual criminal element that
[34:42.450 --> 34:44.210]  does happen from some home grows.
[34:44.210 --> 34:45.410]  It's kind of nitpicking, isn't it?
[34:45.410 --> 34:45.570]  Yeah.
[34:46.290 --> 34:51.570]  Well, the person growing weed in their home on the black market for sale on the black
[34:51.570 --> 34:56.130]  market isn't bothering to follow any of the rules and they're doing everything covertly
[34:56.130 --> 34:58.050]  because they don't want to get caught and arrested.
[34:58.610 --> 35:02.690]  The people who are standing up following the letter of the law, but being dickish about
[35:02.690 --> 35:06.770]  it are just bringing a black guy to the whole community and causing everybody problems.
[35:07.330 --> 35:08.530]  We legalized it.
[35:08.530 --> 35:12.530]  If enough idiots screw up, they're going to take that away.
[35:13.090 --> 35:15.650]  The next president could send the fucking Marines.
[35:17.250 --> 35:19.730]  It's not that outlandish.
[35:19.730 --> 35:22.130]  The vision in my head was just like, because-
[35:22.130 --> 35:23.170]  President Romney?
[35:23.170 --> 35:24.290]  Well, remember in Boston-
[35:24.290 --> 35:24.770]  Bombed.
[35:24.770 --> 35:25.810]  Oh, that is...
[35:25.810 --> 35:27.170]  Don't ever say that again around here, please.
[35:27.170 --> 35:29.890]  Your outdoor garden will get droned.
[35:29.890 --> 35:30.690]  In Boston-
[35:30.690 --> 35:31.650]  If we're not careful.
[35:31.650 --> 35:34.770]  There was a manhunt for somebody after the Boston Marathon bombings.
[35:34.770 --> 35:39.250]  And they were going into every single house and searching every single room looking for
[35:39.250 --> 35:40.050]  these suspects.
[35:40.210 --> 35:40.710]  Yep.
[35:41.490 --> 35:43.490]  Imagine if they tried to do that here.
[35:43.490 --> 35:44.610]  I mean, I did.
[35:44.610 --> 35:46.450]  You know, I mean, no, I'm being facetious.
[35:46.450 --> 35:47.730]  That wouldn't happen in Colorado.
[35:47.730 --> 35:49.410]  That only will happen on the East Coast.
[35:49.410 --> 35:51.170]  We're one of the most armed states there is.
[35:51.170 --> 35:53.170]  I mean, imagine that type of shit going on.
[35:55.170 --> 35:57.410]  Very liberal and very gun friendly.
[35:58.770 --> 36:02.610]  I don't know anyone who grew up here that can't, like didn't grow up shooting.
[36:02.610 --> 36:04.370]  The guns go well with the liberalness.
[36:05.810 --> 36:08.690]  Yeah, because you have to be able to protect yourself being so liberal.
[36:08.690 --> 36:09.170]  You have to.
[36:09.570 --> 36:13.090]  And there's a lot of places in the state where you can fully get eaten by a bear still.
[36:13.090 --> 36:14.530]  Like that's a thing here.
[36:14.530 --> 36:18.850]  30 minutes from here, you can be eaten by several things 30 minutes from here.
[36:18.850 --> 36:21.490]  Hell, they found a moose down in the river earlier this summer.
[36:21.490 --> 36:24.130]  That's one of the most deadly creatures in North America.
[36:24.130 --> 36:25.810]  And people do not respect the moose.
[36:26.530 --> 36:28.690]  It does not have big fangs.
[36:28.690 --> 36:29.650]  No, so they don't get afraid.
[36:29.650 --> 36:31.090]  Watch out for the knuckle part of it.
[36:33.410 --> 36:36.450]  Let's give a shout out to Jesse for a moose knuckle reference on the show.
[36:36.450 --> 36:37.250]  That was pretty good.
[36:37.570 --> 36:38.930]  I don't know.
[36:38.930 --> 36:41.170]  Can we transition from moose knuckle to...
[36:41.170 --> 36:43.890]  Let me just finish it with saying I'm not too afraid to get up,
[36:43.890 --> 36:45.650]  get beat up by a nice moose knuckle.
[36:47.410 --> 36:48.690]  Now let's go to the part you were going to do.
[36:50.610 --> 36:55.010]  As I blush and rub my face a little, I need more weed.
[36:55.810 --> 36:58.690]  So one of the things that just kills me is...
[36:58.690 --> 37:02.770]  I'd like to give you a dab, but on the show you're going to choke for like 30 minutes.
[37:02.770 --> 37:04.930]  Give me the tiniest little baby girly dab.
[37:04.930 --> 37:06.050]  Start talking while I get them ready.
[37:06.050 --> 37:08.850]  I'll take one first and by the time you're done, I'll have a couple dabs going.
[37:08.850 --> 37:13.090]  So one of the things that kills me about the cannabis community is...
[37:14.370 --> 37:18.770]  For the last 80 years or so, we've been forced underground and into the dark
[37:18.770 --> 37:21.330]  and then out of the way and out of sight.
[37:21.330 --> 37:24.050]  And that's how we've survived and that's how we've thrived.
[37:24.690 --> 37:29.810]  But now that it's legal, more of us need to stand the fuck up
[37:30.450 --> 37:34.690]  and show up to city council and show up to vote
[37:35.330 --> 37:39.570]  and show up during budget meetings and have our voices heard.
[37:39.570 --> 37:42.930]  We're used to hiding and pretending like we're not part of the system
[37:43.650 --> 37:48.930]  and we're against the system, but we live here too.
[37:48.930 --> 37:49.970]  It's our city too.
[37:51.410 --> 37:57.810]  We have just as much right to have our city be like we would like it as anyone else in the city.
[37:58.370 --> 38:04.610]  And if nobody shows up and speaks out against a ban on all home growing
[38:04.610 --> 38:06.290]  that requires you to build a building,
[38:07.010 --> 38:12.370]  city council's not going to care that it's ridiculous and unenforceable and a horrible idea.
[38:13.010 --> 38:17.650]  They're going to go ahead and approve it because without thinking about it,
[38:17.650 --> 38:19.330]  just on a quick gut check,
[38:19.330 --> 38:23.570]  it seems like you ought to have the right to wake up in the morning and not smell marijuana.
[38:23.570 --> 38:27.410]  And this ordinance might do that once for somebody maybe.
[38:27.970 --> 38:29.330]  So sure, go ahead and approve it.
[38:29.970 --> 38:35.250]  And if nobody's willing to throw on some clean clothes and show up Monday night at seven o'clock
[38:35.250 --> 38:41.890]  and say, hey, I think this is a really bad idea and I'd appreciate you not passing this ordinance,
[38:42.610 --> 38:44.290]  who knows what's going to happen?
[38:44.290 --> 38:46.370]  I mean, I think they're going to kill it.
[38:46.370 --> 38:49.890]  I think that if I show up and one or two other people show up and speak
[38:50.690 --> 38:54.370]  that they'll go ahead and kill it on the 15th or next month or whatever.
[38:55.170 --> 38:55.730]  Who knows?
[38:55.730 --> 38:56.930]  Nobody's willing to stand up.
[38:56.930 --> 39:03.650]  And that's part of the reason Pueblo City doesn't have any medical shops in it or any rec shops yet
[39:03.650 --> 39:07.970]  because so far it's just me down at city council saying we ought to have these.
[39:07.970 --> 39:12.530]  For a minute we had a little cannabis community group, but they fell apart pretty quick.
[39:12.530 --> 39:13.170]  Quite quickly.
[39:13.170 --> 39:15.010]  Like you don't need a group though.
[39:15.010 --> 39:19.410]  You just need to be a citizen who's willing to show up Monday night at seven.
[39:20.610 --> 39:23.730]  So here's something that I've kind of tossed around in my head.
[39:25.010 --> 39:29.490]  When Mike and I had a shop together, it was owned by somebody else, but we ran that place.
[39:29.490 --> 39:32.690]  There were a couple of times where we had to go to court for a couple of things
[39:32.690 --> 39:36.530]  and to support a member of our group that had a court trial.
[39:36.530 --> 39:39.570]  Also, we went to a couple of city council things to try to speak up.
[39:40.530 --> 39:42.850]  I look like your tip.
[39:42.850 --> 39:43.730]  I know it.
[39:43.730 --> 39:45.810]  I look like a cliche freaking pothead.
[39:45.810 --> 39:46.210]  That's cool.
[39:46.210 --> 39:47.250]  It's an email on a Mike court.
[39:47.250 --> 39:47.650]  No problem.
[39:50.530 --> 39:51.570]  Just a little plastic.
[39:51.570 --> 39:54.130]  It's not the first time that's happened to tell you the truth.
[39:54.370 --> 39:57.490]  I had to learn how to take dabs with a mic in front of me also.
[39:57.490 --> 40:03.010]  So I'm talking about, I used to go to those city council meetings and then I'm saying I'm
[40:03.010 --> 40:05.810]  six foot five with dreadlocks to my ass.
[40:05.810 --> 40:08.210]  Do my dreadlocks go past my ass now?
[40:08.210 --> 40:10.290]  I've got four foot ropes hanging off of my head.
[40:10.290 --> 40:11.010]  He does people.
[40:11.010 --> 40:11.970]  I'm not kidding.
[40:12.530 --> 40:13.090]  Yeah.
[40:13.090 --> 40:14.290]  And there's nowhere to hide them.
[40:14.290 --> 40:18.850]  And even if I put on a collared shirt and I look good, I've still got these Barasta man dreadlocks.
[40:18.850 --> 40:20.690]  Dr. Carl Hart feels your pain, sir.
[40:20.690 --> 40:28.530]  I feel, uh, there's, I'm almost a detriment to the community when I go to city council
[40:28.530 --> 40:31.410]  meetings and show like, look, here's Rasta man here.
[40:31.410 --> 40:33.570]  I feel like I'm a weight on the community.
[40:33.570 --> 40:35.490]  When I show up, I kind of hide because of that.
[40:37.650 --> 40:44.290]  I would say that you're a self-employed successful citizen of our beautiful city and have as much
[40:44.290 --> 40:49.650]  of a right to stand up and claim your piece of it is the best dressed cleanest shave mother
[40:49.650 --> 40:50.450]  fucker in here.
[40:51.330 --> 40:53.410]  I was just going to say, fuck.
[40:53.410 --> 40:53.650]  Yeah.
[40:54.450 --> 40:54.770]  All right.
[40:54.770 --> 41:03.250]  Like you don't have to change who you are to stand up and be part of city government.
[41:03.250 --> 41:04.370]  Everybody gets a vote.
[41:04.370 --> 41:09.650]  Everybody gets to say period the rules of this, the city council meetings, anyone who
[41:09.650 --> 41:15.010]  comes and signs up, um, to speak before the meeting, they usually limit it to six, but
[41:15.010 --> 41:18.530]  they've been allowing more than six people to speak at the beginning of most meetings
[41:18.530 --> 41:22.290]  lately because of, uh, all the hubbub and the recall stuff.
[41:23.090 --> 41:27.730]  But, uh, if you show up to speak, you can, you get your five minutes, as long as you're
[41:27.730 --> 41:31.250]  not cussing or throwing things, you can say whatever you want.
[41:31.250 --> 41:36.050]  And there's these old crotchety people that show up and bitch about whatever their passion
[41:36.050 --> 41:40.610]  issue is every two weeks at every single meeting.
[41:40.610 --> 41:44.610]  They take five minutes at the beginning of the meeting to stand up and say, I don't like
[41:44.610 --> 41:45.410]  any of you.
[41:45.410 --> 41:46.770]  I hate what you're doing.
[41:46.770 --> 41:48.930]  I need all of you to stop right now.
[41:48.930 --> 41:49.810]  It's illegal.
[41:49.810 --> 41:50.850]  I hate you.
[41:50.850 --> 41:53.250]  But he takes five minutes to do that at the beginning of every meeting.
[41:53.250 --> 41:56.290]  And he sits down in his crotchety friend gets up and does the same thing.
[41:57.010 --> 42:03.330]  And they're not any more valid or legitimate than you with your dreadlocks or Jesse with
[42:03.330 --> 42:05.250]  his beard or me with my earrings.
[42:05.250 --> 42:09.090]  Just because I clean up a little better than y'all as far as the cops are concerned, doesn't
[42:09.090 --> 42:13.170]  mean you deserve less or more space in city council than I take.
[42:14.130 --> 42:18.370]  The only reason they talk to me is because I show up all the time and I'm familiar face.
[42:18.370 --> 42:20.530]  Most people leave halfway through the meeting.
[42:21.330 --> 42:27.090]  And then it's just the people that are stuck there playing a role in going through the
[42:27.090 --> 42:28.690]  pageantry of city government.
[42:28.690 --> 42:34.370]  And because I'm willing to hang out for that last hour, I can call city council on two
[42:34.370 --> 42:35.490]  o'clock in the afternoon.
[42:35.490 --> 42:39.330]  And by eight o'clock, I've talked to the three of them personally for like 15 minutes each.
[42:40.610 --> 42:42.130]  I'm a fucking stoner too.
[42:42.770 --> 42:46.930]  Like I'm just willing to stand up and claim my little spot at the table.
[42:47.490 --> 42:48.290]  I like it.
[42:48.290 --> 42:51.810]  My other question is, am I going to attract unwanted attention to myself?
[42:51.810 --> 42:53.250]  Like I'm not doing anything I shouldn't be.
[42:53.250 --> 42:56.610]  But am I going and speaking out as a weed head looking like a weed head?
[42:56.610 --> 42:58.690]  Not bringing weed head trouble to myself.
[42:58.690 --> 43:02.130]  The cops are too busy to especially.
[43:02.930 --> 43:03.430]  Yeah.
[43:04.290 --> 43:05.890]  A friend of mine likes to tell a story.
[43:05.890 --> 43:10.290]  A girlfriend got mad at him and called the cops and said, my boyfriend's growing too
[43:10.290 --> 43:10.850]  much weed.
[43:10.850 --> 43:13.490]  And the cop went weed and hung up the phone.
[43:16.290 --> 43:18.290]  We've got heroin falling off the truck here.
[43:18.290 --> 43:23.170]  We've got a teen pregnancy rate that rivals most counties high school graduation rates.
[43:23.170 --> 43:25.170]  Like cops are busy.
[43:25.970 --> 43:30.210]  The kids that's going to city council with dreadlocks and standing up saying, I don't
[43:30.210 --> 43:35.250]  like this ordinance, please don't vote for it is not someone they need to worry about.
[43:35.250 --> 43:39.730]  Now, if you show up and throw a rock at Sandy Daff, they're probably going to pay attention
[43:39.730 --> 43:42.450]  to who you are and follow you out of the building and give you a lot of problems.
[43:42.450 --> 43:48.930]  But if you stand up and act like a citizen, they'll will treat you like a citizen because
[43:48.930 --> 43:51.650]  doing so anything else is technically a crime.
[43:51.650 --> 43:53.010]  Can I wear a hat in the courtroom?
[43:53.010 --> 43:53.730]  Yep.
[43:53.730 --> 43:54.230]  Nice.
[43:55.170 --> 43:56.290]  Took my dreads up in there.
[43:56.290 --> 43:58.210]  People show up in pajamas.
[43:59.090 --> 44:00.770]  The trash haulers are down there a lot.
[44:00.770 --> 44:02.130]  A lot of them come straight from work.
[44:03.570 --> 44:06.850]  Amina Rocky works full time is a mail carrier.
[44:06.850 --> 44:10.210]  And more often than not is in her work uniform.
[44:11.970 --> 44:15.170]  Even Montoya shows up in a t-shirt nine meetings out of 10.
[44:17.970 --> 44:23.650]  If someone on the council is in a t-shirt, you should feel fine in a grassroots hat,
[44:23.650 --> 44:25.410]  keeping your dreadlocks out of your face.
[44:27.810 --> 44:29.890]  That's a lot of us he's talking to you guys.
[44:29.890 --> 44:30.930]  It's really boring.
[44:32.450 --> 44:33.650]  It's city government.
[44:33.650 --> 44:38.530]  It's a lot of people mumbling about really hyper specific rules and it's sort of bore
[44:38.530 --> 44:45.890]  yourself to tears dull, but it affects your life on a number of in a number of ways regularly.
[44:45.890 --> 44:51.410]  And right now they're looking to kill countless small businesses and every caregiver in the
[44:52.450 --> 44:56.130]  city limits with a dumb rule trying to kill smells.
[44:56.130 --> 45:00.610]  We just wrote them a pretty nice little sales tax check for our first quarter of business.
[45:00.610 --> 45:01.010]  Right.
[45:01.010 --> 45:01.970]  For which business?
[45:02.530 --> 45:03.250]  Hygro Pueblo.
[45:03.330 --> 45:04.850]  Hygro indoor growing supplies.
[45:04.850 --> 45:07.330]  So how often are you at Hygro indoor growing supplies?
[45:08.290 --> 45:09.410]  A lot more lately.
[45:09.410 --> 45:09.890]  Cool.
[45:09.890 --> 45:11.170]  So more frequently.
[45:11.170 --> 45:14.850]  Not to derail Mike's subject here, but guys, a lot of people want to talk to Jesse about
[45:14.850 --> 45:19.330]  growing stuff from the show, uh, catch him at Hygro indoor growing supplies, distract
[45:19.330 --> 45:20.610]  him so that he can't get his work done.
[45:20.610 --> 45:23.970]  It's much more fun to stand there and help you guys out than it is to stack shit up all day.
[45:23.970 --> 45:26.850]  If you bring tabs down, that's a good way to distract me.
[45:30.850 --> 45:32.050]  Oh, it's such a good thing.
[45:32.050 --> 45:32.610]  You're the boss.
[45:34.050 --> 45:35.170]  No, no, I'm not.
[45:35.170 --> 45:37.810]  Well, we've got to say that you are, if you're taking dabs while you're working,
[45:37.810 --> 45:38.770]  I'm just above the law.
[45:41.890 --> 45:43.170]  So guys come to city.
[45:43.170 --> 45:47.010]  If you live in Pueblo, Colorado, uh, is it just city or does the county count?
[45:47.570 --> 45:50.770]  If you're part of the county, come out to all of this stuff affects you guys.
[45:50.770 --> 45:57.410]  If, if the city bands all home growing, the county is going to experience a mass
[45:57.410 --> 46:00.610]  exodus of cannabis caregivers into the county.
[46:00.610 --> 46:05.970]  And with the fit, they've been pitching over one weed farm out and whatever that road is.
[46:05.970 --> 46:11.010]  I don't imagine they'd like the 3000 plus caregivers that live in Pueblo County
[46:11.650 --> 46:17.170]  and have since the medical wear, wear, uh, medical marijuana program started publishing
[46:17.170 --> 46:19.010]  that information about a decade ago.
[46:19.650 --> 46:23.490]  Like all these people are going to have to pack their shit up and take it to the county
[46:23.490 --> 46:24.930]  and the county already to handle that.
[46:24.930 --> 46:27.730]  So county folks show up and say, this is a terrible idea.
[46:27.730 --> 46:29.330]  I'm a well-established caregiver.
[46:29.330 --> 46:32.050]  I've been caregiving for five or six years.
[46:32.050 --> 46:32.690]  Professionally.
[46:32.690 --> 46:34.530]  I call myself a professional caregiver.
[46:34.530 --> 46:35.490]  I do very well at it.
[46:35.490 --> 46:38.370]  My patients love my products, right?
[46:38.370 --> 46:39.090]  They count on it.
[46:39.090 --> 46:39.970]  They rely on it.
[46:40.530 --> 46:45.970]  Um, I have got a system designed where I can provide exactly what they need.
[46:45.970 --> 46:47.650]  I know when my patients are going to call.
[46:47.650 --> 46:51.730]  I know when, I know when my old friend, I know exactly when he's going to run out.
[46:51.730 --> 46:57.890]  I know when everybody I've got them scheduled to have to redo my grow to build another building
[46:57.970 --> 47:03.970]  would cause me to have to leave this town, which would put five people that I'm responsible for
[47:04.690 --> 47:06.930]  in some deep shit with their cannabis needs.
[47:06.930 --> 47:07.490]  Yeah, I would.
[47:08.850 --> 47:09.810]  And where are they going to get it?
[47:09.810 --> 47:12.690]  Because there's not, there aren't going to be any other caregivers to take my spot
[47:12.690 --> 47:16.130]  because they can't grow in their indoor environment.
[47:16.690 --> 47:19.410]  Like not everybody's got a breeding facility somewhere else to work with.
[47:22.130 --> 47:23.330]  Some of us have to, right?
[47:23.330 --> 47:25.250]  Some of us have to stick to the basement.
[47:25.810 --> 47:28.610]  Not to mention, I mean, just the loss of revenue.
[47:29.890 --> 47:38.770]  I think amendment 64 is even with Pueblo, um, every corner they've been able to stopping,
[47:38.770 --> 47:45.330]  having retail stores and grows, uh, in city limits, uh, Pueblo still prospered from amendment 64,
[47:46.050 --> 47:49.330]  you know, in, in, in small ways, but you know,
[47:49.330 --> 47:54.530]  Well, all the secondary employment that is come from 64 Pueblo still enjoying all the
[47:54.530 --> 47:59.490]  electricians, the plumbers, the caregivers, you know, the gross store people moving here.
[47:59.490 --> 48:01.010]  Gross store makes a lot of money from us.
[48:03.170 --> 48:04.690]  I mean, can't lie.
[48:04.690 --> 48:06.530]  Jesse just said they wrote a nice tax check.
[48:06.530 --> 48:08.610]  I wish there was a higher profit margin on it, but
[48:09.170 --> 48:14.930]  The last depression, the one gross store on fourth street sprung up what three new locations
[48:14.930 --> 48:17.170]  and two new competitors bloomed.
[48:17.170 --> 48:17.330]  Yeah.
[48:18.290 --> 48:19.810]  The public went that big folks.
[48:19.810 --> 48:22.130]  And we've got four now.
[48:22.130 --> 48:24.210]  There are five or six hydro, five or six hydro shops.
[48:25.490 --> 48:25.970]  Right.
[48:25.970 --> 48:32.370]  And they're all surviving just fine because there's a lot of employment bleeding off this industry.
[48:33.170 --> 48:34.450]  I'm going to do a shameless plug right here.
[48:34.450 --> 48:36.290]  I've been to all of the hydro shops in this town.
[48:36.930 --> 48:40.290]  That's no doubt at all, all of them several times.
[48:40.290 --> 48:43.890]  And there's a reason why I've chosen one specific shop to be my sponsor.
[48:46.850 --> 48:47.410]  Nice.
[48:47.410 --> 48:49.650]  I was almost out there today just by happenstance.
[48:49.650 --> 48:50.610]  I needed something.
[48:50.610 --> 48:53.170]  And that was what dawned on me as the place to go.
[48:53.170 --> 48:53.410]  Yeah.
[48:54.050 --> 48:57.570]  We're going to have to work out some kind of coupon code or something for the agricultural
[48:57.570 --> 48:58.050]  listeners.
[48:58.050 --> 48:59.090]  I've been thinking that too.
[48:59.970 --> 49:04.050]  Right now, just off the top, if you mentioned that you listened to the show and you're buying
[49:04.050 --> 49:08.690]  something, tell us, you know, and we'll take care of you.
[49:08.690 --> 49:10.210]  It'll probably be something official.
[49:10.210 --> 49:15.010]  It'll probably only work at the Pueblo location because Jesse's not in Denver.
[49:15.570 --> 49:16.210]  Yeah.
[49:16.210 --> 49:22.210]  But tell him anyways, and we'll get something worked out in Denver.
[49:22.210 --> 49:22.610]  Nice.
[49:22.610 --> 49:23.250]  You guys hear that?
[49:23.250 --> 49:26.610]  We're going to get a coupon code or some sort of deal for you guys for listening.
[49:26.610 --> 49:27.890]  I'm also going to do some giveaways.
[49:27.890 --> 49:29.250]  I just haven't decided how to do it.
[49:30.210 --> 49:35.170]  I've got a couple of cool items, possibly some titanium and possibly a t-shirt and maybe
[49:35.170 --> 49:38.050]  a couple of hat pins that need to be given away to listeners.
[49:38.050 --> 49:40.210]  I just need good ideas on how to do it.
[49:40.210 --> 49:42.210]  Instagram and Facebook giveaways feel cheesy.
[49:43.250 --> 49:47.170]  If you give them to me, I'll hand them out to anybody who talks not retarded at council.
[49:48.610 --> 49:50.770]  I was going to say, I'll take one to Sandy Daff.
[49:50.770 --> 49:52.130]  Give her an iRegenetics pin.
[49:52.690 --> 49:53.410]  Well, give me an iRegenetics.
[49:53.410 --> 49:54.930]  Give me Irish shirts for all of them.
[49:57.410 --> 49:58.450]  Not even Chris.
[49:58.450 --> 50:00.050]  They're both really anti-pop.
[50:00.050 --> 50:06.290]  There was back on the subject of the proposed ordinance, they mentioned something about
[50:08.210 --> 50:09.330]  landlords in there.
[50:09.330 --> 50:11.570]  And I kind of thought that was BS too.
[50:11.570 --> 50:14.130]  I know a couple local landlords.
[50:14.690 --> 50:19.570]  One of them has over 30 properties and the other one has 18 properties.
[50:19.570 --> 50:22.770]  And some of those are big duplexes or apartment buildings.
[50:24.530 --> 50:25.410]  They don't care.
[50:25.410 --> 50:30.210]  They actually tell their tenants they don't care that, I'm sorry, I can't name them, but
[50:31.810 --> 50:32.610]  they don't care.
[50:32.610 --> 50:34.530]  Golden information in this state.
[50:34.530 --> 50:36.210]  Almost all of their tenants grow.
[50:36.210 --> 50:38.130]  Almost all of their tenants pay rent on time.
[50:38.130 --> 50:39.410]  They take care of their houses.
[50:40.290 --> 50:41.090]  They love them.
[50:43.010 --> 50:46.930]  So I don't know where they came up with landlords are pissed about this, but.
[50:47.810 --> 50:50.290]  It's because no one in the industry stands up.
[50:50.290 --> 50:57.330]  If you're on city council or you're the police chief or the fire chief, you don't meet caregivers
[50:57.330 --> 50:58.450]  like you two.
[50:58.450 --> 51:01.170]  You meet the caregiver who set his fucking house on fire.
[51:01.810 --> 51:08.290]  You meet the caregiver who got drunk at the bar and backed into somebody's car with three
[51:08.290 --> 51:11.410]  pounds in the trunk and just suing.
[51:11.410 --> 51:12.370]  Or they got a blasting hash in the backyard.
[51:12.370 --> 51:12.610]  Right.
[51:12.610 --> 51:12.770]  Yeah.
[51:12.770 --> 51:17.570]  Somebody blew their garage apart, open blasting and smoking a cigarette at the same time.
[51:17.570 --> 51:18.210]  That's a good point.
[51:19.650 --> 51:24.530]  And because you guys are good at what you do and you've never blown yourself up or set
[51:24.530 --> 51:27.890]  your house on fire, they've never met you.
[51:27.890 --> 51:28.850]  They've never heard of you.
[51:28.850 --> 51:31.490]  They've never seen pictures of your garden.
[51:31.490 --> 51:37.090]  If I could take pictures of your grow room and take them to city council, I could give
[51:37.090 --> 51:42.610]  them an idea of what it looking or what doing it right looks like because they've only ever
[51:42.690 --> 51:46.050]  seen the one that the cops got called on and the cops took pictures of.
[51:46.770 --> 51:48.690]  I mean, that's part of the problem there.
[51:48.690 --> 51:53.650]  Unless you're reading High Times or Kush or which I'm sure they all do.
[51:53.650 --> 51:57.650]  You're blessed like I am and you get to make friends with people like Jeff and Jesse.
[51:59.090 --> 52:01.330]  You never see this.
[52:01.330 --> 52:04.610]  If you guys want pictures, check out I read genetics on Instagram.
[52:04.610 --> 52:06.930]  Also check out Jesse grows on Instagram.
[52:06.930 --> 52:08.450]  Lots of great pot pictures.
[52:08.450 --> 52:08.610]  Yeah.
[52:08.610 --> 52:10.610]  City Council, download Instagram.
[52:10.610 --> 52:13.650]  While you're at it, follow our friend Garden of Weedon on Instagram.
[52:13.650 --> 52:18.290]  If you want high, high quality cannabis pictures, if you like pot porn, do what he just said.
[52:18.290 --> 52:18.530]  Yeah.
[52:19.090 --> 52:19.970]  Nug porn.
[52:19.970 --> 52:24.370]  There's a reason he just won a nice little secret cup there, man.
[52:24.370 --> 52:25.170]  It was good to look up.
[52:25.170 --> 52:26.210]  Uh, I was dabbing.
[52:26.210 --> 52:28.370]  I looked up and suddenly Jesse was at the secret cup.
[52:28.370 --> 52:29.570]  I had no idea you were coming.
[52:29.570 --> 52:30.930]  I thought that was pretty sweet.
[52:30.930 --> 52:34.450]  Yeah, it just flew up real quick and then I blinked and he was gone.
[52:34.450 --> 52:36.210]  I was literally repotting plants.
[52:36.210 --> 52:37.010]  I was like, fuck it.
[52:37.010 --> 52:37.490]  I'm gonna go.
[52:37.730 --> 52:37.970]  Nice.
[52:39.730 --> 52:41.330]  It was about 45 minutes to get there.
[52:41.330 --> 52:43.810]  I think your travel time was more than what you spent there.
[52:43.810 --> 52:44.370]  Yeah, probably.
[52:45.650 --> 52:52.850]  But the best, uh, drive time ever, you know, that was so like exciting watching him.
[52:52.850 --> 52:54.450]  But it was just so cool.
[52:54.450 --> 52:54.690]  Yeah.
[52:54.690 --> 52:59.570]  Once again, big shout out to our buddy Spence for taking home the first place at the secret
[52:59.570 --> 53:00.850]  cup mountain region.
[53:00.850 --> 53:03.730]  I keep wishing him the best of luck in Vegas, but I'm pretty sure he's going to bring it
[53:03.730 --> 53:04.450]  home for us.
[53:04.450 --> 53:05.010]  Oh yeah.
[53:05.010 --> 53:06.930]  He put this little town on the map, bro.
[53:06.930 --> 53:07.330]  Yeah.
[53:07.330 --> 53:11.650]  And see, I mean, for something so positive to, we're always on the map for some psychotically
[53:11.650 --> 53:12.370]  horrid shit.
[53:12.370 --> 53:14.690]  And it's so nice when it's positive.
[53:15.490 --> 53:19.330]  You know, um, another thing I was wanting to say is most caregivers, basements I've
[53:19.330 --> 53:22.930]  seen that that's just a general term for where their grow is.
[53:23.490 --> 53:29.730]  Um, most of them are way cleaner than most dispensaries, uh, girls I've seen.
[53:29.730 --> 53:30.930]  That's just the honest truth.
[53:31.890 --> 53:36.210]  Nine days out of 10, I'd be happy eating off Jeff's grown floor.
[53:36.210 --> 53:40.450]  I'm kind of, I've got a little bit of OCD and that plays very well being a pot farmer.
[53:40.450 --> 53:41.010]  It does.
[53:41.010 --> 53:41.490]  It plays.
[53:41.490 --> 53:43.250]  And you'll notice my front yard is clean.
[53:43.250 --> 53:44.210]  My backyard is clean.
[53:44.210 --> 53:45.730]  The sides of my house are clean.
[53:45.730 --> 53:48.850]  I asked my neighbors, neighbors to remove some debris they had over there.
[53:48.850 --> 53:50.690]  They had a trailer with like old wood.
[53:50.690 --> 53:52.770]  They had chopped down and they didn't take it away for a long time.
[53:52.770 --> 53:56.370]  I was like, I hate to be a stickler, but could you possibly take away that wood?
[53:56.370 --> 53:59.250]  And if you need some more reasons why I'll let you know why it's bugging me.
[53:59.250 --> 54:00.610]  They're like, I'm sorry, we'll get rid of it.
[54:00.610 --> 54:01.410]  And they took us.
[54:01.410 --> 54:02.290]  That's bugs, dude.
[54:02.290 --> 54:03.970]  I don't need every little board.
[54:04.770 --> 54:06.290]  My weeds are pulled all the time.
[54:06.290 --> 54:11.090]  My garden, my back backyard garden is clean because I can't afford the bugs that that will
[54:11.090 --> 54:11.330]  bring.
[54:11.330 --> 54:12.450]  That'll bring more problems.
[54:12.450 --> 54:13.810]  And it also makes your house look like shit.
[54:13.810 --> 54:17.650]  And being a pot grower, I want to be a good citizen and not make my house look like shit.
[54:18.930 --> 54:20.770]  I mean, that's part of the thing.
[54:20.770 --> 54:21.810]  No one sees this.
[54:21.810 --> 54:24.850]  No one sees how well most of the industry does it.
[54:24.850 --> 54:29.650]  They, uh, most of the city council hasn't bothered to go out and visit any of the legal
[54:29.650 --> 54:31.010]  marijuana stores in town.
[54:31.010 --> 54:33.570]  Some of which have been open for like seven, eight years now.
[54:34.130 --> 54:37.570]  I mean, how long has Marisol been open and they can't make that drive?
[54:38.450 --> 54:41.970]  I mean, it's not exactly the best example I could have thrown out, but like, it's been
[54:41.970 --> 54:45.170]  there the longest and that's the first dispensary we got in Pueblo.
[54:45.170 --> 54:46.210]  We got to give them credit.
[54:46.210 --> 54:47.330]  It's the first.
[54:47.330 --> 54:51.330]  And I mean, you can't go out there and check if it's something that's so scary and should
[54:51.330 --> 54:51.890]  be fought.
[54:51.890 --> 54:55.330]  Like, shouldn't you understand your opponent to kill it or at least some nonsense like
[54:55.330 --> 54:57.970]  that and go see it once some Jedi shit right there, bro.
[54:57.970 --> 55:02.770]  But it's so scary if they see it from the parking lot, they'll have to go in and inject
[55:02.770 --> 55:03.650]  some marijuanas.
[55:04.290 --> 55:06.690]  Oh, watch out.
[55:06.690 --> 55:07.970]  They're going to turn gay guys.
[55:07.970 --> 55:13.490]  If you're growing indoors, walk into your grow room and close your eyes and breathe.
[55:13.490 --> 55:18.130]  And if it smells like wet or smells like plants, you're doing it wrong.
[55:18.130 --> 55:19.170]  You need more ventilation.
[55:19.170 --> 55:21.330]  You need more air out and more fresh air in.
[55:21.330 --> 55:23.810]  You don't want to be able to smell that shit in your own grow room.
[55:23.810 --> 55:25.090]  You shouldn't be able to smell it in there.
[55:26.370 --> 55:29.010]  This random grow tip has been brought to you by our genetics.
[55:29.010 --> 55:30.930]  I'm just thinking about filtration and hydro.
[55:30.930 --> 55:32.130]  If we're going to grow indoors.
[55:32.850 --> 55:35.090]  Yeah, I got to order a couple carbon filters, by the way.
[55:35.090 --> 55:37.810]  If we're going to be growing indoors and doing it right, that's that's how you know you're
[55:37.810 --> 55:40.530]  not putting humidity and mildew problems into the house.
[55:40.530 --> 55:43.170]  And that's how you know you're filtering it to your neighbors aren't going to complain.
[55:43.730 --> 55:48.370]  I blew a guy's mind the other day, sold him an intake carbon filter for the intake.
[55:48.370 --> 55:49.170]  That's so sweet.
[55:49.890 --> 55:53.730]  When I first told him about it, he was like, sounds like a waste of money.
[55:53.730 --> 55:58.130]  And within 45 seconds, he was like, oh, oh, oh, wow.
[55:58.130 --> 55:58.290]  Yeah.
[55:59.250 --> 56:03.010]  It's like, dude, even like it makes your light bulbs last longer.
[56:03.010 --> 56:05.730]  I mean, everything is just it's better.
[56:05.730 --> 56:06.450]  Yeah.
[56:06.450 --> 56:06.850]  Yeah.
[56:06.850 --> 56:09.170]  Carbon filters, guys, carbon scrubbers.
[56:09.170 --> 56:13.250]  If you're not using it to just pull the air out of the room that you're growing in, put
[56:13.250 --> 56:16.370]  a filter with a blower in there just right in the middle of the room, either on the floor
[56:16.370 --> 56:19.330]  or hanging in the ceiling to keep the air clean and keep air moving.
[56:19.330 --> 56:21.730]  You can't have too much airflow in your grow room.
[56:21.730 --> 56:22.690]  You really can't.
[56:22.690 --> 56:24.450]  Random tips from some pros today.
[56:24.450 --> 56:26.210]  And we have really good air here, too.
[56:26.450 --> 56:32.930]  So had everyone in town taken that advice at the beginning of the summer, we would not
[56:32.930 --> 56:34.210]  be here recording this episode.
[56:35.650 --> 56:38.530]  I'm a really, you know, I'm an outdoor grower.
[56:39.650 --> 56:41.170]  It's hard to keep that stink away.
[56:41.170 --> 56:42.690]  I don't have a good suggestion.
[56:42.690 --> 56:44.930]  At the same time, have you ever had a neighbor?
[56:46.690 --> 56:49.730]  No, but where I, where I grow outdoors.
[56:49.730 --> 56:54.690]  Well, no, I've, I've been in many back door or backyard gardens back.
[56:54.690 --> 56:55.170]  Jesus.
[56:56.130 --> 56:57.330]  I've been in many backyard.
[56:57.330 --> 56:58.770]  You got something weird on your mind?
[56:58.770 --> 56:59.570]  That kind of.
[57:03.090 --> 57:08.210]  I haven't seen a lot of pissed off neighbors on either side generally, because unless you're
[57:08.210 --> 57:17.010]  doing it in large quantities or you're really good at it, you're not going to produce a
[57:17.010 --> 57:23.010]  level of stink that's there for more than two weeks at any sort of obnoxious level.
[57:23.810 --> 57:27.490]  I mean, we're not talking more than like the dog shit from the guy next door who hasn't
[57:27.490 --> 57:32.450]  raked it up in a couple of weeks or the compost pile that's baking in the sun type odor here.
[57:33.090 --> 57:34.690]  It's not that strong.
[57:34.690 --> 57:36.450]  It's just peculiar.
[57:37.970 --> 57:42.770]  And unless you're a real dick, your neighbor is not going to call the cops and every member
[57:42.770 --> 57:44.450]  of city council instead of you.
[57:45.730 --> 57:49.650]  They're also those people that claim just the smell of pot makes me sick.
[57:49.650 --> 57:50.610]  I get a headache.
[57:50.610 --> 57:54.130]  And I think that's bullshit because I've smelled some all kinds of shit and no smells have
[57:54.130 --> 57:55.250]  ever really given me a headache.
[57:56.050 --> 58:00.530]  Just smelling something probably that's, but there are some people that love to cling to
[58:00.530 --> 58:01.570]  a problem or a.
[58:02.770 --> 58:07.490]  Right now there's a lot of people looking for anything about marijuana to gripe about,
[58:07.490 --> 58:10.930]  which we're seeing a lot of out in Pueblo rest right now.
[58:10.930 --> 58:15.650]  And these folks that are sneaking out, their neighbors are really, you're hurting the cause,
[58:15.650 --> 58:16.130]  man.
[58:16.130 --> 58:18.690]  We succeeded and we got full legalization.
[58:18.690 --> 58:21.650]  And now we've got people looking to throw anchors at us and it sucks.
[58:21.650 --> 58:24.210]  Good job on the stink, but man, turn it down.
[58:24.210 --> 58:26.370]  My in-laws live in Pueblo West.
[58:26.370 --> 58:28.530]  Every Sunday we go out there and eat dinner with them.
[58:29.570 --> 58:30.530]  I grew up out there.
[58:30.530 --> 58:35.970]  So while I went to high school out there, I drive around and stuff like that.
[58:35.970 --> 58:37.330]  Take different roads.
[58:37.330 --> 58:41.410]  Every single time I can find two or three plants sticking above the fence.
[58:42.450 --> 58:43.490]  There's a place out there.
[58:43.650 --> 58:50.050]  Uh, his hoop houses you have in his backyard kind of remind me of what greener side looks
[58:50.050 --> 58:50.210]  like.
[58:52.450 --> 58:55.970]  You know, I mean, they're, they're, they're pushing it.
[58:55.970 --> 58:57.170]  They're pushing the limits.
[58:57.170 --> 58:57.970]  They're being assholes.
[58:59.650 --> 59:00.290]  And that sucks.
[59:01.010 --> 59:02.610]  I thought about going to the mountains.
[59:02.610 --> 59:04.370]  I thought about doing some plants in my backyard.
[59:04.370 --> 59:09.090]  I was going to buy one of those 10 by 10 dog runs and a little greenhouse and put the greenhouse
[59:09.090 --> 59:10.450]  inside the dog run.
[59:10.450 --> 59:14.370]  But, uh, like seven out of 10 growers that have grown some outdoor pot this year have
[59:14.370 --> 59:17.170]  either had caterpillars or thieves in this neighborhood.
[59:17.170 --> 59:19.010]  And I'm just going to pass on the outdoor.
[59:19.810 --> 59:24.450]  One of the things most people don't take into account for the outdoor is you're giving up
[59:25.170 --> 59:30.290]  like 90% of your control so that you can also give up 90% of your energy costs.
[59:31.170 --> 59:32.770]  99% of your control.
[59:32.770 --> 59:33.570]  Well, yeah.
[59:33.570 --> 59:34.210]  95%.
[59:35.010 --> 59:35.650]  Yeah.
[59:35.650 --> 59:35.810]  Yeah.
[59:35.810 --> 59:38.370]  You would be much more qualified to speak on this.
[59:39.090 --> 59:40.130]  Environmentally.
[59:40.130 --> 59:40.370]  Yeah.
[59:40.370 --> 59:41.170]  Weather and bugs.
[59:41.170 --> 59:41.970]  You can do.
[59:41.970 --> 59:44.850]  Weather and bugs are going to kick your ass all summer long.
[59:44.850 --> 59:49.010]  I mean, I just grew a bunch of veggies outdoor this year in the weather and the bugs pretty
[59:49.010 --> 59:52.930]  much killed me, but I still got a massive harvest that you use old pot dirt to grow
[59:52.930 --> 59:53.410]  veggies.
[59:53.410 --> 59:57.730]  I know a bunch of growers that gave me two truckfuls of old pot dirt.
[59:57.730 --> 59:58.610]  Mix it with sand.
[59:58.610 --> 01:00:00.130]  So it holds water a little better.
[01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:02.850]  I mixed it with that clay crap Pueblo was built on.
[01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:03.490]  Yeah.
[01:00:03.490 --> 01:00:05.170]  Worked like a charm folks.
[01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:07.330]  I got zucchinis the size of Jeff.
[01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:10.530]  He brought me some jalapenos, some tomatoes.
[01:00:10.530 --> 01:00:12.290]  I got a nice bag of produce one night.
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:12.930]  That was pretty nice.
[01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:17.570]  It's nice being the hippie kid in the group because all my farmer friends, Jesse was bringing
[01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:18.530]  me killer tomatoes.
[01:00:18.530 --> 01:00:23.010]  I can't even eat a damn tomato anyway now after eating the stuff that he gave me.
[01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:24.610]  My cherry tomatoes are just blooming.
[01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:27.330]  My shit took fucking.
[01:00:30.370 --> 01:00:32.610]  It totally got a second leg.
[01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:33.650]  Her second wind.
[01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:34.210]  Yeah.
[01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:35.250]  That's crazy.
[01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:41.890]  I rarely eat eggs because it's kind of a dietary decision, but also because eggs are disgusting.
[01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.050]  But then Jesse brought me a few eggs and I was like, let's give it a try.
[01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:48.690]  And I cracked them open and the yolk on the inside.
[01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:49.570]  It looked healthy.
[01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:50.690]  They smelled good.
[01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:53.170]  And those eggs were tasty.
[01:00:53.170 --> 01:00:57.650]  I fried them up and made some egg and I forgot what I even did, but those were so good.
[01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:00.930]  And it's not store bought process GMO shit.
[01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.010]  Those real eggs and that real vegetables you brought me so good.
[01:01:05.970 --> 01:01:06.850]  Grow your own, you guys.
[01:01:08.530 --> 01:01:13.090]  Extra links and expense to ensure non GMO food for my chickens.
[01:01:13.090 --> 01:01:13.590]  Nice.
[01:01:15.730 --> 01:01:16.290]  Delicious.
[01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:16.930]  It worked well.
[01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:18.050]  All right, guys, we've gone for an hour.
[01:01:18.050 --> 01:01:20.850]  Do you guys have anything that you'd like to say to start wrapping up the show?
[01:01:20.850 --> 01:01:25.890]  Other than come to the city council meeting in Pueblo, Colorado, October 13th.
[01:01:25.890 --> 01:01:27.890]  I will tweet the exact address.
[01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:31.010]  I will Facebook the exact address so that you guys have no excuse.
[01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:32.450]  We talked about it.
[01:01:33.330 --> 01:01:36.770]  If you're Chewbacca, you can still come to the meeting.
[01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:40.850]  If you don't have any hair, if you've got a lot of hair, if you got long hair, if you got tattoos,
[01:01:40.850 --> 01:01:45.010]  if you got a facial piercing, if you have clean clothes, that's all you got to do.
[01:01:45.010 --> 01:01:50.530]  Just put some clothes in the wash Monday morning, throw some clean clothes on after work Monday
[01:01:50.530 --> 01:01:54.450]  night, head on down to the city council chambers around six o'clock.
[01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:55.890]  The meeting starts at seven.
[01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:01.170]  You want to have a chance to sign up right as you walk into the city council chamber on the third
[01:02:01.170 --> 01:02:01.490]  floor.
[01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:06.130]  There's like a little table with a couple of sheets of paper on it, and they'll have the
[01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.090]  agenda for the night.
[01:02:07.650 --> 01:02:10.930]  And then the signup sheet for people that want to speak at the public forum.
[01:02:12.050 --> 01:02:17.890]  Sign up on the public forum signup sheet if you want to speak and grab an agenda and find a seat.
[01:02:17.890 --> 01:02:21.890]  I usually sit on the right hand side of the chamber if you're looking at the city council
[01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:22.930]  over by the fire chief.
[01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.890]  We'll have the dab rig set up.
[01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:29.250]  No, no, we won't.
[01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:32.050]  Do they search you on the way into this one?
[01:02:32.050 --> 01:02:33.410]  Do you have to go through the metal detector?
[01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:33.910]  Nope.
[01:02:34.610 --> 01:02:38.210]  You just show up, walk upstairs or take the elevator.
[01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:40.290]  It's really handicap accessible.
[01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.050]  Apparently they got sued a few years ago.
[01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:42.850]  Oh, that sucks.
[01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:44.610]  Fuck them, it should have been.
[01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:49.010]  So everybody can go just show up.
[01:02:49.010 --> 01:02:54.050]  If you don't feel comfortable talking or having people know your name, just show up, stand in
[01:02:54.050 --> 01:02:57.250]  the back and clap when someone says something you like.
[01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:02.610]  Unless you're going crazy, they're not even going to notice you.
[01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.370]  They're going to thank you for speaking.
[01:03:04.370 --> 01:03:09.010]  And I mean, even if you're there yelling at them and telling, which I've done before,
[01:03:09.010 --> 01:03:13.890]  you can fully pull a video of me berating city council for dragging their feet online.
[01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:15.030]  Nice.
[01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:21.730]  If we had like 80 people show up, do you think they would ever bring up a pot ordinance again?
[01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:26.370]  If we had 80 people show up, they would do whatever we asked.
[01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:33.090]  If we had five people show up, this ordinance would never see the light of day.
[01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:36.370]  The public meeting that we're asking you to attend is on the 13th.
[01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:41.650]  The ordinance is officially being presented to city council on the 15th.
[01:03:41.650 --> 01:03:47.490]  If half a dozen of us show up on the 13th and three or four of us stand up and speak and say,
[01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:52.450]  we think this is a terrible ordinance, it's unenforceable, it's really bad for Pueblo,
[01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:53.730]  there's no point, don't do it.
[01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.770]  And we're not psychotic about it.
[01:03:58.050 --> 01:04:01.090]  When they present it on the 15th, it'll get killed immediately.
[01:04:01.090 --> 01:04:03.970]  And it will never make it onto the official agenda.
[01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:05.890]  It will never be voted on by city council.
[01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:07.170]  It'll die quickly.
[01:04:07.170 --> 01:04:14.530]  If 30 or 40 of us show up, we'll have the city overlay for the retail stores shaken
[01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:18.210]  out of this planning and zoning commission months earlier than we would otherwise.
[01:04:19.010 --> 01:04:21.410]  Right now, no one shows up.
[01:04:21.410 --> 01:04:22.610]  No one stands up.
[01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:26.210]  No one's called city council to bitch about not seeing this yet.
[01:04:26.210 --> 01:04:29.570]  And so they're dragging their feet and we're not going to see it until after the elections
[01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:30.130]  in November.
[01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:32.850]  Yep.
[01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.770]  So if you're listening to this show and you want something else to do to help out,
[01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:38.290]  register to vote.
[01:04:38.290 --> 01:04:38.610]  Yes.
[01:04:38.610 --> 01:04:39.490]  Sorry for yelling.
[01:04:39.490 --> 01:04:43.010]  So glad I bought a compressor because you just tried to blow up all my equipment, bro.
[01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.330]  I like it.
[01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.170]  The compressor worked.
[01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.610]  It just did its exact damn job.
[01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:49.730]  I didn't realize what I was doing to your equipment until I got to the word vote.
[01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:50.290]  That's awesome.
[01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:52.370]  But by then, petering off would have been silly.
[01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:53.570]  Yeah.
[01:04:53.570 --> 01:04:57.170]  All right, dude, I tried to tell everybody to follow you on Twitter.
[01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:59.330]  Tell us your Twitter handle.
[01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:00.610]  Nemopunk15.
[01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:04.130]  There we go.
[01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:05.490]  Follow that guy on Twitter.
[01:05:05.490 --> 01:05:06.370]  Jesse's got a Twitter.
[01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.210]  It's Jesse Grows OG, right?
[01:05:08.210 --> 01:05:08.690]  Yep.
[01:05:08.690 --> 01:05:09.490]  Follow him there.
[01:05:09.490 --> 01:05:14.850]  You can tell when people listen to the podcast, who's all week long after you did that, like
[01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:19.970]  randomly, I'd get two new followers on Twitter and I'd look at it and they'd be pot related.
[01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.450]  And then two hours later, I'd get one more.
[01:05:22.450 --> 01:05:24.690]  And then three in the morning, I'd get four more.
[01:05:24.690 --> 01:05:25.170]  Nice.
[01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:27.330]  420 in the afternoon, I get another half dozen.
[01:05:28.050 --> 01:05:29.490]  A lot of people listen at 420.
[01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.130]  That's good to know.
[01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:33.570]  Good old three in the morning stoner.
[01:05:33.570 --> 01:05:33.810]  Yeah.
[01:05:33.810 --> 01:05:36.370]  I think I posted something last night at three in the morning.
[01:05:36.370 --> 01:05:40.050]  You and I were commenting on the, I posted a video and you commented on it last night.
[01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:41.970]  You actually said I'm listening to the podcast.
[01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:43.250]  It's about three in the morning.
[01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:43.970]  Yep.
[01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:45.090]  That's the way it goes.
[01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:45.970]  Do the work.
[01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:47.330]  Follow Jesse on Instagram.
[01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:48.690]  He posts a lot of good stuff.
[01:05:48.930 --> 01:05:52.130]  At Jesse grows, J E S S E G R O W S.
[01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.930]  Nice and easy.
[01:05:52.930 --> 01:05:53.330]  Follow him.
[01:05:53.330 --> 01:05:55.090]  He does a lot of cool shit on Instagram.
[01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:57.970]  Follow I read genetics on Instagram.
[01:05:57.970 --> 01:05:59.090]  Follow the show on Instagram.
[01:05:59.090 --> 01:06:02.450]  I don't post a lot of stuff, but I'm starting to post a lot, lot more.
[01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:05.090]  If you follow, he will build the posts.
[01:06:05.090 --> 01:06:05.490]  That's right.
[01:06:06.210 --> 01:06:10.930]  And if you do Instagram, use our hashtag, I grow culture.
[01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:11.410]  There you go.
[01:06:11.410 --> 01:06:12.530]  Some cool pictures on there.
[01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:13.170]  Yeah.
[01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:13.570]  Wow.
[01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.650]  Such a good idea from such a stone dude.
[01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:17.330]  I bet you can do that on Twitter too.
[01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.370]  You can do that on Twitter too.
[01:06:18.610 --> 01:06:19.410]  Still learning it.
[01:06:19.410 --> 01:06:21.330]  So I'm new to Twitter.
[01:06:21.330 --> 01:06:22.450]  Oh, I'm a Twitter monster.
[01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:23.570]  I am a Twitter monster.
[01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:28.290]  I usually end the show and then come back and wrap it up, but I'm just going to do it now
[01:06:28.290 --> 01:06:32.530]  because we've got it going on because I want to ask my, my listeners for one thing.
[01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.490]  I need a theme song.
[01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.730]  I've been playing other artists songs and I've been playing that one reggae song.
[01:06:37.730 --> 01:06:40.050]  You hear is a theme that I made on iTunes.
[01:06:40.050 --> 01:06:41.730]  It's not acceptable or on garage band.
[01:06:41.730 --> 01:06:42.130]  Sorry.
[01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:43.090]  That's not acceptable.
[01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:47.810]  If somebody would make me a super cool theme about two minutes long, maybe
[01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:50.610]  say a few key phrases.
[01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:54.850]  I grow culture podcast hosted by Rasta Jeff brought to you by IRI genetics.
[01:06:54.850 --> 01:06:59.250]  You know, I would make it up to you in some sort of way, depending on what state you live in and
[01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:00.050]  how old you are.
[01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:03.410]  We could work on a little compensation, but there would definitely be some pay in there.
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:04.130]  I'm not begging.
[01:07:04.130 --> 01:07:05.010]  I just need a theme song.
[01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:08.130]  I'm tired of listening to that cheesy reggae tune I made.
[01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:12.930]  And I've been putting the show on you on YouTube and YouTube gets mad at me for using all those
[01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:14.290]  other people's songs.
[01:07:14.290 --> 01:07:15.650]  I've got their written permission.
[01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:17.250]  All the artists that I use, I've got permission.
[01:07:17.250 --> 01:07:18.930]  Proving that to Google's tricky.
[01:07:18.930 --> 01:07:19.410]  Exactly.
[01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:20.770]  They don't even care if you do prove it.
[01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:22.290]  They're like that email doesn't mean shit to us.
[01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:25.010]  We need a written letter from a record label with notary.
[01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:27.490]  And yeah, sorry, dude, have Bono call us.
[01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:30.370]  Yeah, that's the artist I'm using are actually my friends.
[01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:31.890]  It's like Mystic Roots and Task Rock.
[01:07:31.890 --> 01:07:33.170]  And I've been like, hey, can I use your music?
[01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:34.370]  I'm like, yeah, of course, bro.
[01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:37.810]  So there's like, you know, they've said yes, but that's as far as we've gotten.
[01:07:37.810 --> 01:07:39.890]  Yeah, you can't play Google that voicemail.
[01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:40.450]  That's right.
[01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.730]  So somebody, if you want to write, I like reggae, obviously, if you wanted to write a
[01:07:43.730 --> 01:07:45.010]  couple of them, that'd be bad ass.
[01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:48.770]  Maybe one for the start of the show, one for the end of the show, maybe a short piece
[01:07:48.770 --> 01:07:53.330]  for like between segments, something with a real aggressive dancehall reggae beat would
[01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:54.370]  be pretty smooth.
[01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:54.770]  I don't know.
[01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:55.810]  I'm just begging at this point.
[01:07:55.810 --> 01:07:56.690]  I could use a theme song.
[01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:57.810]  That's what I'm trying to get at.
[01:07:57.810 --> 01:07:59.410]  He also likes death metal.
[01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:02.370]  Like, so he's a big Slayer fan.
[01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:06.050]  So anything with there's nothing like getting real high and just listening to a thousand
[01:08:06.050 --> 01:08:06.290]  beats.
[01:08:09.410 --> 01:08:10.210]  Please don't do that.
[01:08:12.050 --> 01:08:14.130]  Don't don't waste your energy.
[01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:15.250]  We'll play it when Jesse comes on.
[01:08:15.250 --> 01:08:16.130]  We like and Jesse.
[01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.810]  I don't even like.
[01:08:18.930 --> 01:08:19.890]  Yeah, I'll see.
[01:08:19.890 --> 01:08:20.450]  Don't do that.
[01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:20.850]  Don't do that.
[01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:21.410]  I like reggae.
[01:08:21.410 --> 01:08:22.290]  I like some funky shit.
[01:08:22.290 --> 01:08:24.130]  I'm a huge fish, Grateful Dead kind of guy.
[01:08:24.130 --> 01:08:28.050]  So, you know, agriculture podcast needs a theme song and you'll be compensated in some
[01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:28.610]  way or another.
[01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:31.010]  If you're in Colorado, I'll get high with you.
[01:08:31.010 --> 01:08:32.770]  I'll definitely hook you up with some seeds.
[01:08:32.770 --> 01:08:36.290]  If you're in Colorado, I just have to make sure you're 21 and in Colorado.
[01:08:36.290 --> 01:08:36.930]  I can't do that.
[01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:39.970]  If you're outside of Colorado, if you come to Colorado, I'll get you seeds.
[01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:40.850]  I got you.
[01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:44.530]  One of my favorite things to wear around town is my I repin and you can wear the fuck out
[01:08:44.530 --> 01:08:47.650]  of that in Pennsylvania or New York or any other state that sucks out loud.
[01:08:47.650 --> 01:08:51.410]  And you could also probably get an Irish genetics t shirt if I have your size and some stickers
[01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:52.770]  and a pan will make it worth it.
[01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:53.970]  Trust me, right?
[01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:54.850]  There's other stuff, too.
[01:08:54.850 --> 01:08:57.250]  I've got prizes that could be built.
[01:08:57.250 --> 01:08:57.730]  That's right.
[01:08:57.730 --> 01:08:59.970]  Some I go culture t shirts.
[01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:02.530]  It's a good idea.
[01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:04.690]  Cottonmouth there for a second.
[01:09:04.690 --> 01:09:07.170]  So if anybody wants to fund some agriculture t shirts.
[01:09:07.650 --> 01:09:09.890]  Yeah, just the song.
[01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:11.570]  The cast is now taking donations.
[01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:12.530]  The song first.
[01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.930]  People have contacted me about sponsoring the show.
[01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:17.330]  If you'd like to sponsor the show, email me.
[01:09:17.330 --> 01:09:19.010]  I grow culture at hotmail.com.
[01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:20.450]  I'll send you all the sponsor details.
[01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:21.970]  I've got a little one sheet made up.
[01:09:21.970 --> 01:09:23.250]  It's nice and easy to understand.
[01:09:23.250 --> 01:09:24.210]  We'll get a deal going.
[01:09:25.090 --> 01:09:27.010]  Man, I want to thank you guys for coming to do a great show.
[01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:27.890]  This has been really fun.
[01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:31.010]  We've had a lot of good just kind of chilling out banters kind of stuff.
[01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.490]  It's nice.
[01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:32.850]  The listeners appreciate that.
[01:09:32.850 --> 01:09:34.930]  Mike is very well spoken.
[01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:35.330]  Thank you.
[01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:38.370]  Between the three of us, we've covered all the bases.
[01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:40.050]  I enjoyed this as well.
[01:09:40.050 --> 01:09:41.730]  I've been dying to get back on here.
[01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:42.290]  It's been what?
[01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:44.210]  This is 34.
[01:09:44.210 --> 01:09:45.810]  Oh, dude, it's good to see you feeling better.
[01:09:45.810 --> 01:09:49.250]  Episodes because you were supposed to be here a few episodes ago and didn't feel well.
[01:09:49.250 --> 01:09:51.010]  I almost died last week with my back.
[01:09:51.010 --> 01:09:51.490]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:51.490 --> 01:09:52.930]  So jury duty almost killed me.
[01:09:52.930 --> 01:09:54.530]  It's good to see you doing well again.
[01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:55.970]  It's nice to be back on my feet.
[01:09:56.610 --> 01:09:59.170]  All right, guys, I'm going to do unless you guys have anything else to say.
[01:09:59.170 --> 01:09:59.890]  I'm going to do the end.
[01:10:00.930 --> 01:10:01.330]  Wrap it up.
[01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.370]  They all went blank at me.
[01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:03.330]  All right, so it goes like this.
[01:10:03.330 --> 01:10:05.090]  Now that the show's over, please go to iTunes.
[01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:06.210]  Go to the iTunes store.
[01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.330]  Search for I grow culture.
[01:10:07.330 --> 01:10:08.290]  Find the review section.
[01:10:08.290 --> 01:10:09.890]  Give me a five star rating.
[01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:10.370]  Come on.
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:12.050]  You know you want to give me a five star rating.
[01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:14.050]  Do it after that type in a little comment.
[01:10:14.050 --> 01:10:17.570]  Let me know what you think of the show, and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[01:10:17.570 --> 01:10:19.730]  He hasn't done it yet, but he keeps promising to do it.
[01:10:19.730 --> 01:10:23.810]  So if somebody comments, three people have left comments, and I've read all three of theirs and
[01:10:23.810 --> 01:10:25.330]  thank those three people largely.
[01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:28.610]  When more people leave some iTunes and or stitcher comments, I will read them.
[01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:29.970]  I skipped episode 21.
[01:10:29.970 --> 01:10:30.530]  So my bad.
[01:10:31.810 --> 01:10:32.930]  Mention the moose knuckle.
[01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:39.010]  If you say moose knuckle in a tweet or something, I will high five you mentally from wherever you are.
[01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:40.690]  But please do leave comments.
[01:10:40.690 --> 01:10:42.930]  The guys that left comments, I do appreciate you.
[01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:43.570]  I'm not forgetting.
[01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:45.570]  I know that they're there, and I appreciate it.
[01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:46.370]  Also, tweet us.
[01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:46.930]  I like that.
[01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:48.930]  You can do the same thing on stitcher.
[01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:49.890]  You can leave comments there.
[01:10:49.890 --> 01:10:53.890]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, stitcher, swell.am.
[01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:54.850]  I don't think it's there anymore.
[01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.930]  I think swell.am is gone to tell you the truth.
[01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:59.090]  I'm just going to delete that right from my notes.
[01:10:59.090 --> 01:11:00.450]  Screw swell.am.
[01:11:01.570 --> 01:11:01.970]  It's on.
[01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.570]  I read genetics, colorado.com.
[01:11:03.570 --> 01:11:06.290]  And also I'm adding videos to YouTube.
[01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:07.730]  I'm doing it real slowly.
[01:11:07.730 --> 01:11:09.970]  It takes me about an hour to make a video each night.
[01:11:09.970 --> 01:11:12.850]  Sometimes I can knock out two in an hour, but they're kind of cheesy.
[01:11:12.850 --> 01:11:14.050]  The videos aren't great yet.
[01:11:14.050 --> 01:11:15.250]  I'm just trying to get catched up.
[01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:18.930]  So once I get them better caught up, I will give you better shows.
[01:11:18.930 --> 01:11:21.090]  So check me out on YouTube if that's easier for you.
[01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:24.530]  iTunes, stitcher, I read genetics, colorado.com.
[01:11:24.530 --> 01:11:27.490]  Make sure you follow us all on our Instagram and Twitter.
[01:11:27.490 --> 01:11:28.930]  I gave those out several times.
[01:11:29.650 --> 01:11:31.570]  Once again, a huge shout out to my ninja spence.
[01:11:31.730 --> 01:11:33.330]  Congratulations for taking home the win.
[01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.850]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[01:11:34.850 --> 01:11:37.650]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:39.090]  I think Mike's always wanted to say that.
[01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:39.730]  That's awesome.
[01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:41.570]  Thanks for listening, guys.
