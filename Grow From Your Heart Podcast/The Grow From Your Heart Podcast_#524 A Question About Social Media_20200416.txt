[00:00.000 --> 00:02.320]  All right, happy quarantine, everybody.

[00:46.720 --> 00:50.560]  You know I like to start this podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:50.560 --> 00:55.880]  Today I picked up some Crescendo Live batter from Green Dot Labs.
[00:55.880 --> 01:00.860]  Crescendo is a cross of chem D I-95 and mandarin cookies.
[01:00.860 --> 01:06.580]  On the package, the flavor is described as heavy chem, gas, and cookie dough.
[01:06.580 --> 01:09.620]  When I cracked this concentrate open, I was delighted.
[01:09.620 --> 01:13.200]  The color and texture of this batter are perfect.
[01:13.200 --> 01:15.960]  And then this aroma punches you in the face.
[01:15.960 --> 01:20.040]  The first thing you get, the first thing I get is a sweetness and it makes you go, oh,
[01:20.040 --> 01:21.040]  what's that sweet?
[01:21.040 --> 01:25.840]  And then you smell and it's like chocolate chip cookie dough, but then there's gas and
[01:25.840 --> 01:26.840]  chem.
[01:26.840 --> 01:32.440]  It's just gassy funk right in the face, but the sweetness really comes to your face first
[01:32.440 --> 01:33.520]  or at least my face first.
[01:33.520 --> 01:36.880]  I can't say what's going to happen to your nose, but I get that sweetness and then it
[01:36.880 --> 01:43.240]  is really backed up by a really powerful chem dog, gassy funk sort of aroma.
[01:43.240 --> 01:48.440]  I'm really loving the Crescendo Live batter from Green Dot Labs and it has got me lit.
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.560]  I really enjoy the buzz that I get from this concentrate and the flavor is just stuck on
[01:53.560 --> 01:54.560]  my tongue.
[01:54.560 --> 01:55.560]  It will not go away.
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.900]  It's like a chocolate chip cookie and some gassy chem and I'm loving it.
[01:59.900 --> 02:02.760]  So big shout out to my friends at Green Dot Labs.
[02:02.760 --> 02:07.820]  And of course, an extra thank you to my friends at the Colorado Cannabis Exchange for taking
[02:07.820 --> 02:11.920]  good care of me when they got the fresh Green Dot drop.
[02:11.920 --> 02:16.160]  All right, quarantinians and coronians, in this episode, I'm going to read a couple of
[02:16.160 --> 02:17.800]  listener emails.
[02:17.840 --> 02:22.360]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to the kind folks who continue to support
[02:22.360 --> 02:24.680]  the show on Patreon.
[02:24.680 --> 02:30.160]  All of today's bong rips and dabs and joints will of course be digital and virtual.
[02:30.160 --> 02:32.120]  We've got to adjust to today's world.
[02:32.120 --> 02:36.120]  So until we get things back under control, until everybody is safe and healthy, let's
[02:36.120 --> 02:40.940]  go ahead and send some virtual digital bong rips and digital dabs to all of our friends.
[02:40.940 --> 02:45.400]  Let's start off by rolling up a big fat digital joint, lighten that fucker up virtually and
[02:45.400 --> 02:47.880]  passing it over to my buddy Keith R.
[02:47.880 --> 02:50.560]  Then let's pack up a big fat bong load.
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.440]  We're going to send that digital bong rip over to my buddy Maroney.
[02:54.440 --> 02:57.080]  Then I want to pack up some delicious rosin.
[02:57.080 --> 02:58.520]  Let's get some rosin on the dabber.
[02:58.520 --> 03:04.060]  Let's get the nail nice and warm and let's send that digital dab over to my buddy Freakfish.
[03:04.060 --> 03:07.600]  Then let's get some sticky dank herb, put that in the bong.
[03:07.600 --> 03:09.860]  Then let's put some Keith on top of that one.
[03:09.860 --> 03:12.640]  Let's send that one over to my buddy Carlos B.
[03:12.640 --> 03:17.360]  We should also bake up a big fat tray of surprisingly potent edibles and send those
[03:17.360 --> 03:19.560]  over to my buddy Tobes McLovin.
[03:19.560 --> 03:24.000]  I also want to roll up a fat joint and put some Keith down the middle of it.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.640]  We're going to send that fucker over to Mason 602.
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.320]  I've got to send a special high five and a digital dab over to my buddy Dan, the indoor
[03:32.320 --> 03:33.320]  man.
[03:33.320 --> 03:38.280]  I have always got a virtual bong rip for my buddy OkiGrow720.
[03:38.280 --> 03:41.280]  Let's do a gravity bong with my buddy Hogan's Farms.
[03:41.280 --> 03:42.800]  We forgot about the gravity bong.
[03:42.800 --> 03:43.800]  That's old school.
[03:43.800 --> 03:44.800]  Let's go high school.
[03:44.800 --> 03:48.000]  How about some gravity bongs for my friends out at Hogan's Farms?
[03:48.000 --> 03:50.500]  Let's not forget our friends Rick Roller keeping us fed.
[03:50.500 --> 03:53.320]  Big shout out to my friends Rick Roller with their food truck.
[03:53.320 --> 03:57.160]  Big shout out, big high five, big digital dab to my friends Rick Roller and everybody
[03:57.160 --> 03:59.000]  in the food truck game.
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.480]  Let's wrap up these digital shout outs by sending a giant big fat bong rip over to my
[04:04.480 --> 04:06.760]  buddy Nate Williams.
[04:06.760 --> 04:11.720]  Big thanks, big shout out, big bong rip, big high five to everybody who has continued
[04:11.720 --> 04:13.280]  to support the show.
[04:13.280 --> 04:16.600]  If you're not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so, all
[04:16.600 --> 04:23.160]  you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[04:23.160 --> 04:26.440]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[04:26.440 --> 04:32.800]  Of course, I did include a link in the show notes to make it easy for my stoned friends.
[04:32.800 --> 04:38.640]  If you're curious what happens to those Patreon contributions, I recently paid for my website
[04:38.640 --> 04:39.760]  renewal.
[04:39.760 --> 04:41.960]  My website is where I host the show.
[04:41.960 --> 04:43.240]  The show goes up to the website.
[04:43.240 --> 04:45.600]  It goes into an RSS feed.
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.560]  That makes the show available for Apple podcasting.
[04:48.560 --> 04:50.640]  That makes the show available for Stitcher.
[04:50.640 --> 04:56.120]  The website and the RSS feed was covered by the Patreon contribution.
[04:56.120 --> 04:58.320]  Thank you to everybody who helps out.
[04:58.320 --> 05:00.360]  I also try to keep the MacBook up to speed.
[05:00.360 --> 05:04.360]  I just had to do some updates and repairs to my computer that I use for the show.
[05:04.360 --> 05:06.520]  That came through the Patreon contributions.
[05:06.520 --> 05:08.840]  I also buy new fresh microphone covers.
[05:08.840 --> 05:12.520]  I also recently purchased some podcast advertising.
[05:12.520 --> 05:14.280]  I got some little flyers made.
[05:14.280 --> 05:18.400]  Those are going in all of the orders that come from Seeds here now so that we can share
[05:18.400 --> 05:20.160]  the show with more people.
[05:20.160 --> 05:23.680]  I'm trying to improve the show by buying better and more equipment.
[05:23.680 --> 05:27.580]  I'm also trying to expand our audience by getting some advertising made.
[05:27.580 --> 05:30.820]  That is what is happening with your Patreon contributions.
[05:30.820 --> 05:34.620]  Big thanks once again and big shout out for all of the continued support.
[05:34.620 --> 05:39.380]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers
[05:39.380 --> 05:44.700]  and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers, it is time to move into the email portion
[05:44.700 --> 05:47.100]  of today's episode.
[05:47.100 --> 05:52.100]  I have been getting a lot of messages on several different platforms with questions for the
[05:52.100 --> 05:53.100]  podcast.
[05:53.100 --> 05:58.060]  The easiest way for you to get your question on the show is to email me at growfromyourheart
[05:58.060 --> 05:59.700]  at hotmail.com.
[05:59.700 --> 06:03.300]  That is the easiest way for me to find all of the messages in one place.
[06:03.300 --> 06:04.780]  I do find them on YouTube.
[06:04.780 --> 06:06.300]  I find messages on Instagram.
[06:06.300 --> 06:08.180]  I find them on Cannabuzz.
[06:08.180 --> 06:12.380]  But the easiest place for me to keep all of my messages in one place is, of course, the
[06:12.380 --> 06:15.920]  email inbox at growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[06:15.920 --> 06:19.420]  When I'm writing a podcast, when I'm doing work for the show, that is the first place
[06:19.420 --> 06:22.060]  I look for messages and questions.
[06:22.060 --> 06:24.860]  It's easier for me to keep those all in one place.
[06:24.860 --> 06:28.340]  If you comment on YouTube, I have to remember which video you left the comment on.
[06:28.340 --> 06:30.020]  I got to scroll back and find it.
[06:30.020 --> 06:32.320]  Sometimes I try to take a screenshot with my phone.
[06:32.320 --> 06:34.060]  It becomes overwhelming.
[06:34.060 --> 06:38.860]  If you really want to get your question on the show, the most reliable way is to send
[06:38.860 --> 06:41.580]  me an email at growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[06:41.580 --> 06:45.260]  All right, now let's get into today's first email.
[06:45.260 --> 06:48.980]  This email comes from a friend who signed it as a demo.
[06:48.980 --> 06:51.740]  The subject is question, and it goes a lot like this.
[06:52.420 --> 06:55.420]  It says, Hey, Rasta Jeff, I really love your show and all of the work you do.
[06:55.420 --> 06:56.420]  Thank you.
[06:56.420 --> 06:57.420]  I appreciate that.
[06:57.420 --> 07:01.700]  It says, I have learned a lot so far listening to your podcast and The Dude Grows.
[07:01.700 --> 07:03.740]  Big shout out to my friends at The Dude Grows.
[07:03.740 --> 07:08.260]  If you enjoy my show, I think you would really enjoy The Dude Grows show.
[07:08.260 --> 07:10.660]  It is available wherever you're listening to my show.
[07:10.660 --> 07:14.900]  If you're here on iTunes, if you're here on YouTube, The Dude Grows is available on that
[07:14.900 --> 07:16.300]  platform as well.
[07:16.300 --> 07:17.300]  Go check them out.
[07:17.300 --> 07:19.340]  I think you'll learn a lot from them as well.
[07:19.340 --> 07:21.140]  Listen to that one when this show is over.
[07:21.140 --> 07:25.100]  This message goes on to say, I am on my second grow and things are looking good.
[07:25.100 --> 07:26.100]  Excellent, bro.
[07:26.100 --> 07:27.100]  I like to hear that.
[07:27.100 --> 07:29.820]  I hope this grow is a little bit better than the first grow.
[07:29.820 --> 07:31.940]  And then I hope the next grow is even better.
[07:31.940 --> 07:33.940]  And if you have more questions, let me know.
[07:33.940 --> 07:35.220]  We'll get you going.
[07:35.220 --> 07:36.220]  The message goes on.
[07:36.220 --> 07:40.280]  It says, We have medical here where I live, so I am growing my own medicine.
[07:40.280 --> 07:42.800]  That has got to be an amazing feeling.
[07:42.800 --> 07:44.660]  First of all, you've got the right to grow.
[07:44.660 --> 07:46.700]  That is very stress relieving.
[07:46.700 --> 07:49.420]  You were probably growing your medicine before it was legal.
[07:49.420 --> 07:52.900]  So now you've got that little bit of stress taken off your shoulders and you're growing
[07:52.900 --> 07:54.100]  your own medicine.
[07:54.100 --> 07:58.780]  You're producing a product that at the end of the day will make you feel better.
[07:58.780 --> 08:03.260]  That feeling is a big part of why I am in the medical marijuana industry, why I've stuck
[08:03.260 --> 08:06.520]  around for so long, and why I've got such passion.
[08:06.520 --> 08:12.400]  I used to run a medical marijuana dispensary in my town and I would help elderly people.
[08:12.400 --> 08:14.020]  I would help young people.
[08:14.020 --> 08:15.900]  I would help mentally ill people.
[08:15.900 --> 08:18.300]  I would help people of all walks of lives.
[08:18.300 --> 08:23.180]  They came from everywhere with all types of situations and I would be able to improve
[08:23.180 --> 08:28.060]  all of their lives in a very small way by helping them out with cannabis, a product
[08:28.060 --> 08:30.340]  I grew and then gave to these people.
[08:30.340 --> 08:33.780]  They smoked and they came back next week and they looked like they were better, mentally
[08:33.780 --> 08:35.340]  and physically better.
[08:35.340 --> 08:37.280]  They came in looking like they were in pain.
[08:37.280 --> 08:38.580]  They came in looking depressed.
[08:38.580 --> 08:40.060]  They came in looking alone.
[08:40.060 --> 08:43.260]  I sold them a quarter of a good herb and I told them, come back next week and let me
[08:43.260 --> 08:44.260]  know how this works.
[08:44.260 --> 08:45.460]  They came back with a smile.
[08:45.820 --> 08:49.500]  They said, hey, Ross to Jeff, I smoked that and my back pain went away.
[08:49.500 --> 08:52.620]  And then since my back pain went away, I wasn't an asshole to my wife.
[08:52.620 --> 08:56.260]  And since I wasn't an asshole to my wife, we got along and we had dinner and now my
[08:56.260 --> 08:57.700]  life is way better.
[08:57.700 --> 08:59.640]  And shit like that, it snowballs.
[08:59.640 --> 09:00.900]  You start seeing those effects.
[09:00.900 --> 09:03.400]  I'm rambling now, but I've got a lot of passion for this.
[09:03.400 --> 09:04.400]  That is why I'm here.
[09:04.400 --> 09:06.500]  I still get to see those effects.
[09:06.500 --> 09:11.860]  I breed strains that are known worldwide and people are finding relief from strains I have
[09:11.860 --> 09:12.860]  created.
[09:12.860 --> 09:14.300]  That is such a great feeling.
[09:14.300 --> 09:17.420]  So I'm proud of you for taking the leap to grow your own medicine.
[09:17.420 --> 09:20.500]  You're going to put a lot of pride and care into that product.
[09:20.500 --> 09:25.220]  And when you smoke it, you will feel that pride, that care, and that love come right
[09:25.220 --> 09:26.340]  back to you.
[09:26.340 --> 09:30.540]  You'll inhale and you'll be filled with pride and relief and you'll feel better and you'll
[09:30.540 --> 09:32.220]  say, holy shit, I did that.
[09:32.220 --> 09:34.680]  And that feeling alone will make you feel better.
[09:34.680 --> 09:36.660]  And then smoking will make you feel better.
[09:36.660 --> 09:37.900]  And it's just going to continue.
[09:37.900 --> 09:41.860]  All right, let me keep myself on track because I've got a lot of rambles in me from that
[09:41.860 --> 09:42.860]  dab.
[09:42.860 --> 09:43.860]  All right, let's get to it.
[09:43.860 --> 09:47.660]  There's a lot more to this message and it says, the question I have is about Instagram.
[09:47.660 --> 09:50.140]  I noticed and follow you on Instagram.
[09:50.140 --> 09:51.140]  Thanks for the follow.
[09:51.140 --> 09:54.220]  If you're not following me on Instagram, I recommend you do so.
[09:54.220 --> 09:56.980]  On Instagram, I am irie underscore genetics.
[09:56.980 --> 09:59.900]  It's I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[09:59.900 --> 10:02.060]  I hope you can spell genetics by now.
[10:02.060 --> 10:04.260]  Also find me on Cannabuzz.
[10:04.260 --> 10:08.900]  I am on Cannabuzz with the same name, irie underscore genetics.
[10:08.900 --> 10:14.180]  Cannabuzz is a free social media application, a lot like Instagram, but it is much more
[10:14.180 --> 10:15.400]  cannabis friendly.
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.600]  You can post your dab videos and your grow photos there.
[10:18.600 --> 10:24.780]  You cannot buy, sell, or trade cannabis on Cannabuzz, but it is a cannabis friendly social
[10:24.780 --> 10:25.960]  media application.
[10:25.960 --> 10:27.640]  I invite you to join me.
[10:27.640 --> 10:30.460]  And I am going to talk about Cannabuzz later in the episode.
[10:30.460 --> 10:32.100]  So stick around for that part.
[10:32.100 --> 10:33.420]  Instagram, there's more to this.
[10:33.420 --> 10:37.400]  It says, I've noticed that you post a lot of pictures of your work on there.
[10:37.400 --> 10:40.260]  Is that safe and can you get in trouble?
[10:40.260 --> 10:44.240]  It goes on to say, I'm getting mixed messages looking it up online.
[10:44.240 --> 10:47.720]  So thanks and have a great day from Demo.
[10:47.720 --> 10:48.720]  That is a great question.
[10:48.720 --> 10:55.120]  I do post a lot of cannabis content on social media, especially Instagram and Cannabuzz.
[10:55.120 --> 10:58.480]  I try to post every day to those social media platforms.
[10:58.480 --> 11:00.360]  I take a lot of great photos.
[11:00.360 --> 11:01.560]  People like to see them.
[11:01.560 --> 11:02.640]  Why not share them?
[11:02.640 --> 11:03.680]  I get a good following.
[11:03.680 --> 11:04.920]  I get a lot of response.
[11:04.920 --> 11:07.600]  The question is, is that safe?
[11:07.600 --> 11:11.040]  That is a very good and very important question.
[11:11.040 --> 11:14.440]  There are many variables which play into my answer.
[11:14.440 --> 11:18.480]  My first question is, is it legal to grow cannabis where you are?
[11:18.480 --> 11:23.540]  If you are posting from an illegal place, you may need to make extra security measures.
[11:23.540 --> 11:25.320]  You may need to use a VPN.
[11:25.320 --> 11:29.360]  You may need to do things to keep yourself and your location extra private.
[11:29.360 --> 11:33.840]  If you are in an illegal location and you want to post photos of your grow, don't post
[11:33.840 --> 11:35.080]  other stuff.
[11:35.080 --> 11:38.840]  Don't post pictures of outside because a lot of people are crazy.
[11:38.840 --> 11:41.000]  A lot of people have very good memories.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.220]  The internet makes things way too easy.
[11:43.220 --> 11:47.880]  If you post an intersection and I can recognize one building in that intersection, I can find
[11:47.880 --> 11:49.040]  your grow.
[11:49.040 --> 11:54.040]  If I am a robber or a cop or somebody who wants to fuck with you, I can cause you problems
[11:54.040 --> 11:55.400]  very easily.
[11:55.400 --> 11:59.760]  The world has gotten strange with the internet, so be very mindful of what you're posting.
[11:59.760 --> 12:03.240]  If you're in an illegal area, only post photos of your grow.
[12:03.240 --> 12:05.960]  Make it a dedicated grow account.
[12:05.960 --> 12:07.580]  Also use a VPN.
[12:07.580 --> 12:13.080]  Also do whatever you can do to make sure you're not posting any meta data in your photos.
[12:13.080 --> 12:15.280]  There is a lot of data attached to a photo.
[12:15.280 --> 12:20.240]  If it's taken with your iPhone, your iPhone knows when, where, and how that photo was
[12:20.240 --> 12:21.240]  taken.
[12:21.240 --> 12:22.320]  It knows the time and date.
[12:22.320 --> 12:24.720]  It knows the exact location.
[12:24.720 --> 12:28.960]  It also remembers the settings of your camera when you took that photo.
[12:28.960 --> 12:32.160]  There is a lot of info stored in that file.
[12:32.160 --> 12:33.920]  That is the first thing I worry about.
[12:33.920 --> 12:37.360]  If you are not in a legal area, you need to up your privacy.
[12:37.360 --> 12:39.140]  Don't ever post your face.
[12:39.140 --> 12:42.200]  Don't post your hands if you've got tattoos on your hands.
[12:42.200 --> 12:45.440]  I can recognize people by their tattoos.
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.120]  If I can recognize you by your tattoos, so can law enforcement.
[12:49.120 --> 12:50.320]  So can robbers.
[12:50.320 --> 12:52.760]  So can whoever wants to cause you problems.
[12:52.760 --> 12:57.080]  So if you've got a weird octopus tattoo on your hand, cover that shit up in your photos.
[12:57.080 --> 13:00.920]  If you've got some initials or something tattooed on you, cover that shit up.
[13:00.920 --> 13:02.360]  Be very careful.
[13:02.360 --> 13:05.820]  So my main concern obviously is safety in an illegal area.
[13:05.820 --> 13:07.240]  Don't post yourself.
[13:07.240 --> 13:08.480]  Don't post your vehicles.
[13:08.480 --> 13:09.840]  Don't post license plates.
[13:09.840 --> 13:11.600]  Don't post familiar landmarks.
[13:11.600 --> 13:17.360]  If you're going to have a Grow-based Instagram account, only make it a Grow-based Instagram
[13:17.360 --> 13:18.360]  account.
[13:18.360 --> 13:19.360]  Don't put your dog in there.
[13:19.360 --> 13:20.720]  Don't put your family in there.
[13:20.720 --> 13:22.080]  Don't put other shit in there.
[13:22.080 --> 13:23.600]  Keep it just as a Grow.
[13:23.600 --> 13:25.160]  Then make another account.
[13:25.160 --> 13:27.400]  Post all your silly shit that you want to post there.
[13:27.400 --> 13:28.800]  Make that one fun.
[13:28.800 --> 13:31.920]  Don't give people any hints, especially law enforcement.
[13:31.920 --> 13:36.120]  So if you're in a non-legal area, you need to be much more careful.
[13:36.120 --> 13:40.060]  Now if you are in a legal area, we still have things to worry about.
[13:40.060 --> 13:41.600]  There are plant counts.
[13:41.600 --> 13:46.880]  If your limit is six plants, never post a picture of more than six plants.
[13:46.880 --> 13:50.520]  Also, keep in mind that people like to steal shit.
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.360]  Cannabis is very valuable.
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.760]  There are people who are entering the cannabis business, the cannabis game, that have forgotten
[13:56.760 --> 13:59.800]  that at one point this was criminal activity.
[13:59.800 --> 14:01.320]  It still brings a lot of money.
[14:01.320 --> 14:03.160]  It still brings a lot of profit.
[14:03.160 --> 14:07.660]  There are people out there who would rather take your work and make your profit instead
[14:07.660 --> 14:09.380]  of doing the work themselves.
[14:09.380 --> 14:14.520]  So if you post a photo, hey, look at my Grow, and the guy down the street goes, hey, I know
[14:14.520 --> 14:15.520]  that guy.
[14:15.520 --> 14:16.760]  His Grow's almost done.
[14:16.760 --> 14:18.680]  He's going to wait 10 or 14 days.
[14:18.680 --> 14:21.800]  Hopefully you post a picture of harvest and let him know it's fucking done.
[14:21.800 --> 14:24.320]  They're going to come in your front door, maybe come in your back door.
[14:24.320 --> 14:25.360]  They're going to get your shit.
[14:25.360 --> 14:27.440]  They're going to leave you in a scary situation.
[14:27.440 --> 14:28.880]  Who knows how that's going to end?
[14:28.880 --> 14:30.400]  Let's not even think about that.
[14:30.400 --> 14:32.400]  But it is a possibility.
[14:32.400 --> 14:34.880]  So be very careful with what you're posting.
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.240]  The whole goal of posting shit is for people to see it.
[14:38.240 --> 14:39.720]  What do you want them to see?
[14:39.720 --> 14:41.320]  Who may be seeing that?
[14:41.320 --> 14:45.760]  Anybody on the planet can open up Instagram and find your photos once you've posted them
[14:45.760 --> 14:46.760]  there.
[14:46.760 --> 14:49.920]  We can also grab a screenshot, and that photo never goes away.
[14:49.920 --> 14:51.760]  It's stored forever in my phone.
[14:51.760 --> 14:53.480]  I've probably sent it to other people.
[14:53.480 --> 14:56.520]  If it's something good, that shit will never disappear.
[14:56.520 --> 14:58.960]  So be very careful what you're posting.
[14:58.960 --> 15:00.400]  Don't give away your location.
[15:00.400 --> 15:01.640]  Don't give away your address.
[15:01.640 --> 15:04.160]  Try to keep your vehicles and all that shit private.
[15:04.160 --> 15:07.360]  I keep repeating myself, but security is very important to me.
[15:07.360 --> 15:10.400]  Now you're going to say, Rasta Jeff, you post a ton of photos.
[15:10.400 --> 15:17.280]  Yes, many of the photos I post come from commercial cultivation facilities in Colorado.
[15:17.280 --> 15:18.920]  First key part, Colorado.
[15:18.920 --> 15:19.920]  This is legal.
[15:19.920 --> 15:21.760]  Commercial recreational growth can happen.
[15:21.760 --> 15:25.680]  We can do that as long as we stay within our legal limits.
[15:25.680 --> 15:27.720]  So never post more than your limit.
[15:27.720 --> 15:28.920]  Don't brag too much.
[15:28.920 --> 15:30.320]  Show a couple of plants.
[15:30.320 --> 15:31.320]  Don't show the whole room.
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.520]  I just mentioned commercial cultivation facilities.
[15:34.520 --> 15:35.520]  That's fully legal here.
[15:35.520 --> 15:36.520]  I get paid to do that.
[15:36.520 --> 15:37.520]  We pay taxes on it.
[15:37.520 --> 15:39.080]  The city has inspected our buildings.
[15:39.080 --> 15:41.280]  They know exactly what's happening in there.
[15:41.280 --> 15:43.080]  I can post those shots worry-free.
[15:43.080 --> 15:46.720]  Also, they are very secure facilities.
[15:46.720 --> 15:49.120]  You've got fences around every building.
[15:49.120 --> 15:50.720]  All the doors are super locked.
[15:50.720 --> 15:52.760]  There are more cameras than you could imagine.
[15:52.760 --> 15:54.640]  There are crazy alarm systems.
[15:54.640 --> 15:58.200]  If anything goes on there, that's a very secure environment.
[15:58.200 --> 15:59.800]  I'm not worried about that.
[15:59.800 --> 16:01.720]  The personal home grow.
[16:01.720 --> 16:05.640]  When I post photos of that, here's something I don't talk about very often.
[16:05.640 --> 16:08.000]  Most of the photos I post are a little bit old.
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.640]  I have taught my friends, never post an upcoming harvest.
[16:11.640 --> 16:13.920]  Post that harvest when the product is gone.
[16:13.920 --> 16:16.160]  So you should be a couple of weeks behind.
[16:16.200 --> 16:19.640]  If you're posting pictures of almost finished plants, they should be gone.
[16:19.640 --> 16:24.680]  They should be harvested, dried, and cured, and either consumed or sold if that's what
[16:24.680 --> 16:25.680]  you do.
[16:25.680 --> 16:28.000]  That shit should be gone before you post a photo of it.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  That is my trick.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.320]  That is my method of staying a little bit safe.
[16:31.320 --> 16:34.480]  I also practice a theory known as don't shit where you eat.
[16:34.480 --> 16:37.240]  If your grow is in your house, don't have people over.
[16:37.240 --> 16:38.640]  Don't tell people where you live.
[16:38.640 --> 16:39.980]  Don't let them know it's there.
[16:39.980 --> 16:42.520]  Have your grow in a separate location if possible.
[16:42.520 --> 16:45.760]  I know that sounds crazy, but it's ideal.
[16:46.360 --> 16:48.680]  If somebody did see me posting photos of a harvest, they said,
[16:48.680 --> 16:50.880]  Oh shit, Rasta Jeff is chopping down plants.
[16:50.880 --> 16:51.880]  Let's go get it.
[16:51.880 --> 16:52.880]  They could come in here.
[16:52.880 --> 16:55.440]  There ain't shit here because I'm not shitting where I eat.
[16:55.440 --> 16:56.860]  My food's at another spot.
[16:56.860 --> 16:58.200]  My shit's at another spot.
[16:58.200 --> 16:59.560]  You can't find them both.
[16:59.560 --> 17:03.760]  Also, if you're seeing the photos and you're timing your moves based on my photos, you're
[17:03.760 --> 17:06.280]  two weeks late because I already moved all that product.
[17:06.280 --> 17:07.280]  It's gone.
[17:07.280 --> 17:12.000]  So those are a few ways to throw people off if you were trying to have an Instagram that
[17:12.000 --> 17:15.640]  could be making you a little bit paranoid.
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.260]  Like I've said before, that everybody on the planet can see everything you post and many
[17:21.260 --> 17:28.000]  of your photos will contain digital data that will tell your location and your time and
[17:28.000 --> 17:31.120]  the settings that you used on those photos.
[17:31.120 --> 17:35.640]  Technology is amazing, but technology can also be a motherfucker sometimes.
[17:35.640 --> 17:38.320]  So now let's talk about a couple of other details.
[17:38.320 --> 17:40.560]  Security and safety, privacy.
[17:40.560 --> 17:45.000]  That's obviously the number one thing to think about when it comes to posting on Instagram.
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.080]  Also law enforcement.
[17:46.080 --> 17:48.080]  Are you going to incriminate yourself?
[17:48.080 --> 17:51.640]  Will your Instagram feed be used against you in a court of law?
[17:51.640 --> 17:56.040]  Will your Instagram videos, will your live feed be used against you in a court of law?
[17:56.040 --> 17:59.600]  Think about how you're going to defend all of your shit when you were on the stand.
[17:59.600 --> 18:00.600]  What are you going to say about that?
[18:00.600 --> 18:01.960]  Yeah, those are my plants.
[18:01.960 --> 18:03.040]  That's me posing by them.
[18:03.040 --> 18:04.320]  That's me with a selfie.
[18:04.320 --> 18:05.820]  Is it going to work in court?
[18:05.820 --> 18:07.040]  Think about that shit.
[18:07.040 --> 18:11.800]  The next thing we have to think about is Instagram can be a little bitch sometimes.
[18:11.800 --> 18:13.200]  Instagram is not a fan of cannabis.
[18:13.200 --> 18:14.940]  They don't want us on there.
[18:14.940 --> 18:19.980]  They try to find logical, rational reasons to get rid of us, but some of us play by the
[18:19.980 --> 18:21.780]  rules very closely.
[18:21.780 --> 18:25.340]  We barely dance on the rules and they don't take down our accounts because of the way
[18:25.340 --> 18:26.740]  we play.
[18:26.740 --> 18:31.780]  If you post the wrong content or if you use the wrong words on Instagram, they will delete
[18:31.780 --> 18:37.020]  your post and enough deleted posts will result in a banned account.
[18:37.020 --> 18:42.420]  I have found that when I post pictures of plants and flowers, Instagram doesn't take
[18:42.420 --> 18:43.620]  them down.
[18:43.620 --> 18:50.900]  If I post dried buds or smoking videos, those get noticed and flagged and taken down immediately.
[18:50.900 --> 18:57.700]  Also, do not use the hashtags or the words cannabis or marijuana or anything in that
[18:57.700 --> 18:58.700]  realm.
[18:58.700 --> 19:05.380]  Maybe hashtag 420, maybe hashtag ganja farmer, but those are also used to find posts to be
[19:05.380 --> 19:06.460]  taken down.
[19:06.460 --> 19:08.820]  Be careful how you're tagging your stuff.
[19:08.820 --> 19:14.460]  I don't know for sure, but from what I have seen from my posts and other friends' accounts,
[19:14.460 --> 19:17.380]  when you're posting plants, those are plants.
[19:17.380 --> 19:18.440]  That could be hemp.
[19:18.440 --> 19:19.780]  Those are just flowers.
[19:19.780 --> 19:23.960]  But the minute we cut it down and trim it and dry it and cure it, I think Instagram
[19:23.960 --> 19:29.180]  decides at that point that it's cannabis and now it's drugs and their little algorithm
[19:29.180 --> 19:32.820]  or whatever the fuck they're using to decide who's a good boy and a bad boy.
[19:32.820 --> 19:38.100]  So I think posting educational photos of plants is working for me, but the minute we start
[19:38.380 --> 19:42.540]  smoking it and consuming it, that is when Instagram has a problem.
[19:42.540 --> 19:48.780]  Another thing, never post a dollar sign in your description, in your comments, in your
[19:48.780 --> 19:50.300]  questions.
[19:50.300 --> 19:51.860]  Instagram can find the dollar sign.
[19:51.860 --> 19:54.900]  They are looking for that dollar sign in everything.
[19:54.900 --> 19:56.980]  When they see that, your post will get flagged.
[19:56.980 --> 20:00.520]  You're not supposed to be doing business of any kind on Instagram.
[20:00.520 --> 20:05.060]  If you're selling shoes, if you're selling Nikes, if you're selling fucking COVID masks,
[20:05.060 --> 20:08.300]  they don't want that happening unless you've got a business account and you're doing it
[20:08.300 --> 20:09.300]  properly.
[20:09.300 --> 20:13.420]  So they will flag you and they'll take your shit down for the use of a dollar sign.
[20:13.420 --> 20:16.500]  I know that sounds crazy, but we're walking on thin ice.
[20:16.500 --> 20:19.720]  We're in a weird part of history right now.
[20:19.720 --> 20:22.760]  Cannabis is quasi-illegal in some places.
[20:22.760 --> 20:27.500]  Cannabis is looked at in a very different light right now, but businesses have to act
[20:27.500 --> 20:29.780]  like cannabis is illegal.
[20:29.780 --> 20:32.860]  They have to follow the most strict rule wherever they are.
[20:32.860 --> 20:36.340]  So if they're in the United States, which I'm pretty sure that's where Instagram is
[20:36.340 --> 20:42.260]  based, they have to follow the rules and laws of whichever state has the strictest cannabis
[20:42.260 --> 20:44.180]  rules.
[20:44.180 --> 20:46.020]  Instagram is a multi-million dollar company.
[20:46.020 --> 20:48.440]  They do not want to lose a dollar of that money.
[20:48.440 --> 20:49.740]  They do not want to go to court.
[20:49.740 --> 20:54.420]  They don't want to be accused of advocating, promoting, or facilitating any sort of cannabis
[20:54.420 --> 20:55.500]  activity.
[20:55.500 --> 20:57.040]  Think about it this way.
[20:57.040 --> 21:01.820]  If two strangers or two people who know each other communicate through Instagram and there
[21:01.820 --> 21:08.020]  is a transfer of an illegal product and an exchange of money, Instagram just facilitated
[21:08.020 --> 21:11.460]  an illegal deal and they can be charged with a crime.
[21:11.460 --> 21:15.100]  If those two people go to jail, they get in trouble, and they have a good smart lawyer,
[21:15.100 --> 21:16.660]  they can say, what about Instagram?
[21:16.660 --> 21:19.460]  Instagram was a third party in this drug deal.
[21:19.460 --> 21:25.420]  That may sound completely crazy, but lawyers and law and judges are also completely fucking
[21:25.420 --> 21:26.420]  crazy.
[21:26.420 --> 21:30.180]  So Instagram is doing everything they can to keep themselves out of trouble.
[21:30.220 --> 21:34.460]  If somebody has a rule that says you can run 10 miles an hour here, you can go three miles
[21:34.460 --> 21:37.580]  an hour here, you can go one here, Instagram is safe.
[21:37.580 --> 21:39.540]  They go with the one mile an hour rule.
[21:39.540 --> 21:42.740]  That way they don't get in trouble in the one mile an hour zone.
[21:42.740 --> 21:47.540]  So keep in mind that the main objective is to not piss off Instagram, not to disrupt
[21:47.540 --> 21:49.380]  the Instagram algorithm.
[21:49.380 --> 21:54.660]  Don't get noticed too much by Instagram, but do what you can to get noticed by your followers
[21:54.660 --> 21:59.220]  and understand that what they are doing is a basic business practice to protect themselves
[21:59.260 --> 22:00.940]  from losing millions of dollars.
[22:00.940 --> 22:05.380]  A lot of people think it's bullshit, but if you had multi-million dollars, you would do
[22:05.380 --> 22:08.420]  a lot of stupid shit to protect that money as well.
[22:08.420 --> 22:12.140]  Now talking about money, that makes me think of something I should probably say.
[22:12.140 --> 22:14.220]  I am not a lawyer.
[22:14.220 --> 22:20.380]  Do not take legal advice from a guy with dreadlocks to his knees who calls himself Rasta Jeff.
[22:20.380 --> 22:24.020]  If you are taking legal advice from me, you are going to have a bad time.
[22:24.020 --> 22:26.060]  I am not qualified for that shit.
[22:26.060 --> 22:31.060]  So what I am telling you is basically my experience and what I have learned from playing
[22:31.060 --> 22:32.260]  and dealing with Instagram.
[22:32.260 --> 22:36.860]  I have had several accounts taken down and I know how to message and interact with them
[22:36.860 --> 22:38.740]  to get my accounts reinstated.
[22:38.740 --> 22:41.940]  So I feel very lucky that I've gotten this far.
[22:41.940 --> 22:45.100]  Another thing that I keep in mind is we've come a long way.
[22:45.100 --> 22:47.600]  When I was doing this back in the day, we had to hide.
[22:47.600 --> 22:50.540]  If you tried to take a picture of your weed plants, one of your friends would slap your
[22:50.540 --> 22:52.980]  fucking camera out of your hand and say, what are you doing, you idiot?
[22:52.980 --> 22:54.340]  You can't take pictures of that shit.
[22:54.340 --> 22:55.640]  We'll go to jail.
[22:56.220 --> 23:00.920]  So just to have the opportunity to share my ganja photos with the world, I feel like we
[23:00.920 --> 23:03.440]  have come a really long way.
[23:03.440 --> 23:06.240]  Maybe that's a different mindset because I come from the dark ages.
[23:06.240 --> 23:07.720]  I come from the old school.
[23:07.720 --> 23:11.040]  A lot of you younger folks have never had to experience that.
[23:11.040 --> 23:15.120]  A lot of people came into the cannabis game, the cannabis industry, the cannabis scene
[23:15.120 --> 23:16.360]  when it was already legal.
[23:16.360 --> 23:19.120]  So you didn't have to worry about that sort of stuff.
[23:19.120 --> 23:22.120]  Like I said a moment ago, I came from the dark ages of cannabis.
[23:22.120 --> 23:25.440]  And if you told anybody about your grow, you were already fucking up.
[23:26.240 --> 23:29.120]  The number one rule of growing was don't tell anybody.
[23:29.120 --> 23:30.320]  It was like fight club.
[23:30.320 --> 23:32.080]  Don't talk about fight club.
[23:32.080 --> 23:36.280]  So when people start talking about how Instagram hates us and social media is bullshit and
[23:36.280 --> 23:40.240]  all that, I kind of laugh and I say, bro, if I would have posted any of these pictures
[23:40.240 --> 23:43.240]  15 years ago, my house would have been raided.
[23:43.240 --> 23:45.040]  My front door would have been pulled off.
[23:45.040 --> 23:46.720]  Flash bangs would have been thrown in the windows.
[23:46.720 --> 23:48.720]  My dogs would have been shot.
[23:48.720 --> 23:50.160]  Then they don't fuck around.
[23:50.160 --> 23:54.080]  They cut all of your couch cushions open with a razor blade because you could be hiding
[23:54.120 --> 23:55.960]  drugs in the couch cushions.
[23:55.960 --> 23:59.920]  They dump all of your food out of your fridge and your refrigerator because you may be hiding
[23:59.920 --> 24:01.080]  drugs in there.
[24:01.080 --> 24:02.800]  They destroy your fucking house.
[24:02.800 --> 24:03.800]  They take you to jail.
[24:03.800 --> 24:06.800]  They leave the front door unlocked when they take you to jail.
[24:06.800 --> 24:10.080]  So who knows who the fuck is going to come into your house while all of your shit is
[24:10.080 --> 24:13.520]  just splayed out everywhere because the cops dumped it all out.
[24:13.520 --> 24:16.000]  So I look at it as a completely different time.
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.880]  Now we can post our photos of our cannabis to Instagram and sit back and see how many
[24:20.880 --> 24:22.240]  likes we get.
[24:22.240 --> 24:26.560]  So sometimes it makes me laugh when I hear the youngsters talking about how social media
[24:26.560 --> 24:29.440]  is controlling and will not allow us to do our thing.
[24:29.440 --> 24:32.360]  Bro, back in the day, they used to raid you for this shit.
[24:32.360 --> 24:33.560]  Now they just take down your account.
[24:33.560 --> 24:35.080]  You got to start a new account.
[24:35.080 --> 24:36.280]  It's not that big of a deal.
[24:36.280 --> 24:37.280]  All right.
[24:37.280 --> 24:41.040]  So the short answer to that is if you were in a legal area and you feel safe, go ahead
[24:41.040 --> 24:45.120]  and post your garden, but also take measures to keep yourself safe.
[24:45.120 --> 24:46.120]  Don't show your face.
[24:46.120 --> 24:47.120]  Don't show your dog.
[24:47.120 --> 24:48.120]  Don't show your family.
[24:48.120 --> 24:49.560]  Definitely don't show your kids.
[24:49.560 --> 24:54.200]  Try not to reveal your location unless you are ready to deal with that sort of stuff.
[24:54.200 --> 24:57.080]  You may have some unwanted repercussions.
[24:57.080 --> 24:58.240]  Be ready for all of that.
[24:58.240 --> 25:01.440]  Hey, my friend Demo, I want to thank you for listening to the podcast.
[25:01.440 --> 25:03.320]  I want to thank you for a great email.
[25:03.320 --> 25:07.640]  If anybody else out there has a cannabis culture or a cannabis cultivation question, I would
[25:07.640 --> 25:08.640]  love to hear from you.
[25:08.640 --> 25:13.200]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[25:13.200 --> 25:16.240]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, I did mention that I was going to talk
[25:16.240 --> 25:18.220]  more about cannabis.
[25:18.220 --> 25:23.900]  With all of the 420 events being postponed or canceled because of the COVID-19 situation,
[25:23.900 --> 25:29.340]  my friends over at Cannabuzz have decided to put together a virtual cup for 420.
[25:29.340 --> 25:30.340]  That's right.
[25:30.340 --> 25:37.080]  Saturday on April 18th from noon to 3 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, we will be doing a
[25:37.080 --> 25:40.680]  virtual cannabis cup on the Cannabuzz app.
[25:40.680 --> 25:44.020]  You can log in on your computer or your mobile device.
[25:44.020 --> 25:49.620]  I do invite you to come hang out with us on Cannabuzz for the 420 virtual cannabis
[25:49.620 --> 25:50.620]  cup.
[25:50.620 --> 25:52.060]  I will be part of the 420 party.
[25:52.060 --> 25:56.580]  We will have a lot of other great speakers and guests on the show.
[25:56.580 --> 25:57.580]  Come hang out.
[25:57.580 --> 25:58.780]  It should be a good time.
[25:58.780 --> 25:59.780]  What else are you going to do?
[25:59.780 --> 26:01.580]  We're all stuck at home on quarantine.
[26:01.580 --> 26:04.780]  Come smoke with the gang on Cannabuzz on 418.
[26:04.780 --> 26:10.940]  Again, that is April 18th from noon till 3 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
[26:10.940 --> 26:16.340]  Just go to Cannabuzz.app or open the app on your mobile device.
[26:16.340 --> 26:17.340]  All right, everybody.
[26:17.340 --> 26:19.700]  I think that is all I've got for you for this Thursday episode.
[26:19.700 --> 26:21.340]  I want to thank you for hanging out.
[26:21.340 --> 26:23.940]  Don't forget that Monday is 420.
[26:23.940 --> 26:25.580]  I hope you have a great 420.
[26:25.580 --> 26:26.940]  I know we are on quarantine.
[26:26.940 --> 26:29.700]  I know we're supposed to stay home and behave ourselves.
[26:29.700 --> 26:31.460]  Please follow those rules.
[26:31.460 --> 26:32.780]  Try not to get anybody else sick.
[26:32.780 --> 26:36.780]  I know you may be young and healthy, but who knows who you're going to spread your germs
[26:36.780 --> 26:37.780]  to.
[26:37.780 --> 26:38.780]  Let's be mindful.
[26:38.780 --> 26:39.940]  Let's think about other people.
[26:39.940 --> 26:42.820]  Let's take good care of everybody, not just ourselves.
[26:42.820 --> 26:45.860]  You can still have a good, safe, fun 420.
[26:45.860 --> 26:47.820]  I hope you get to smoke something delicious.
[26:47.820 --> 26:50.500]  I hope you get to dab something ridiculous.
[26:50.500 --> 26:53.140]  Maybe if you're into it, maybe you eat too much edibles.
[26:53.140 --> 26:54.140]  That's not for me.
[26:54.140 --> 26:55.220]  I just become a zombie.
[26:55.220 --> 26:56.500]  I go into a coma.
[26:56.500 --> 27:01.100]  However you do it, whatever you do, have a beautiful, safe 420.
[27:01.100 --> 27:06.140]  Make sure you check out seedsherenow.com because they will be doing a 420 sale.
[27:06.140 --> 27:08.140]  That's seedsherenow.com.

[27:13.340 --> 27:19.620]  Also don't forget about my Patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[27:19.620 --> 27:21.300]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[27:21.300 --> 27:22.940]  I'll be back in a couple of days.
[27:22.940 --> 27:26.900]  I want to give a giant shout out to my buddy Dan, the indoor man.
[27:26.900 --> 27:30.420]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.

[27:46.780 --> 27:47.780]  Bye.
[27:47.780 --> 27:48.780]  Bye.
[27:48.780 --> 27:49.780]  Bye.
[27:49.780 --> 27:50.780]  Bye.
[27:50.780 --> 27:51.780]  Bye.
[27:51.780 --> 27:52.780]  Bye.
[27:52.780 --> 27:53.780]  Bye.
[27:53.780 --> 27:54.780]  Bye.
[27:54.780 --> 27:55.780]  Bye.
[27:55.780 --> 27:56.780]  Bye.
[27:56.780 --> 27:57.780]  Bye.
[27:57.780 --> 27:58.780]  Bye.
[27:58.780 --> 27:59.780]  Bye.
[27:59.780 --> 28:00.780]  Bye.
[28:00.780 --> 28:01.780]  Bye.
[28:01.780 --> 28:02.780]  Bye.
[28:02.780 --> 28:03.780]  Bye.
[28:03.780 --> 28:04.780]  Bye.
[28:04.780 --> 28:05.780]  Bye.
[28:05.780 --> 28:06.780]  Bye.
[28:06.780 --> 28:07.780]  Bye.
[28:07.780 --> 28:13.780]  They make this world an hypocrisy The bigger heads are claiming immunity
[28:13.780 --> 28:16.780]  They claim it's not their responsibility
[28:16.780 --> 28:21.780]  The people must rise up A mighty highway fill our cup
[28:21.780 --> 28:27.780]  The righteous, they will never give up Chant until Babylon is gone
[28:27.780 --> 28:38.780]  Kids and doggies are the backbone in the street People shut down, oh God, what have they made?
[28:38.780 --> 28:49.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you turn, I just knock down Only the strong will survive
[28:50.780 --> 28:56.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down
[28:56.780 --> 29:07.780]  Oh, child, let your children stay alive Only the righteous man shall live in the last days
[29:07.780 --> 29:17.780]  These are the days of prophecy Only the hopeful one can live upright
[29:17.780 --> 29:23.780]  Things are fine, shall make it through the giddy up
[29:23.780 --> 29:34.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down Only the strong will survive
[29:34.780 --> 29:41.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down
[29:41.780 --> 29:44.780]  Oh, child, let your children stay alive
[29:44.780 --> 29:51.780]  We teach a militancy to nominate Christians Because only righteousness can bring forth peace
[29:51.780 --> 29:56.780]  Half to hell, the king from the east Bust the seal and us rule the beast
[29:56.780 --> 30:02.780]  But on the breastplate of righteousness The helmet of salvation
[30:02.780 --> 30:08.780]  The heart of harvest Be prepared, all you nations
[30:09.780 --> 30:16.780]  For God sold out the world He gave his only son
[30:16.780 --> 30:20.780]  And who may believe Can live on, on and on
[30:20.780 --> 30:31.780]  But I say, rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down Only the strong will survive
[30:31.780 --> 30:39.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down
[30:39.780 --> 30:47.780]  Oh, child, let your children stay alive Oh, child, for God and I'm you
[30:47.780 --> 30:55.780]  Oh, Josie, for all the old and the new And if my life is long, Jesus, come with my help
[30:55.780 --> 30:59.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time
[30:59.780 --> 31:03.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down
[31:03.780 --> 31:13.780]  Rough times, man and man living in a tough time Everywhere you go, I just knock down
[31:13.780 --> 31:16.780]  Oh, child, let your children stay alive
