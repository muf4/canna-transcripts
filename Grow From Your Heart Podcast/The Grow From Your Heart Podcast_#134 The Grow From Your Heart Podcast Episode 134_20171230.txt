[00:05.190 --> 00:07.190]  From Your Heart podcast.
[00:07.190 --> 00:24.430]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.

[00:28.630 --> 00:29.630]  news, education, and conversation.

[00:30.630 --> 00:35.070]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker or a dedicated
[00:35.070 --> 00:38.830]  dabber, if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the current
[00:38.830 --> 00:43.710]  state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you.

[00:50.230 --> 00:53.030]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.

[01:01.990 --> 01:03.350]  I think they're doing five or six shows.

[01:07.470 --> 01:08.830]  I will be at the Black Sheep show.
[01:08.830 --> 01:10.390]  I hope to see you there.
[01:10.390 --> 01:14.030]  Once again, much love to my friends in the Mystic Roots band and the entire Stay Positive
[01:14.150 --> 01:15.150]  Productions company.

[01:46.630 --> 01:48.470]  Big shout out to my buddy Citizen Jay.
[01:48.470 --> 01:49.470]  Thanks for supporting the podcast.
[01:49.470 --> 01:51.510]  Make sure you guys check that out.
[01:51.510 --> 01:52.950]  I think that's all the official business.
[01:52.950 --> 01:55.310]  I got one more thing I do have to remind you guys of.
[01:55.310 --> 01:56.910]  I've got an update is what this is.
[01:56.910 --> 02:02.730]  On episode number 126, we're talking about the organization that was passing out joints
[02:02.730 --> 02:04.930]  to people who collected trash in the park.
[02:04.930 --> 02:08.470]  We made a comment about how it was not cool that they were giving out joints in the park.
[02:08.470 --> 02:10.350]  I've been corrected, you guys.
[02:10.350 --> 02:13.190]  Big shout out to Lindsey and Chris for correcting me.
[02:13.190 --> 02:15.910]  They were listening to the podcast and they were like, hey dude, they did not give the
[02:15.910 --> 02:17.710]  joints out in the park.
[02:17.710 --> 02:19.030]  What happened?
[02:19.030 --> 02:23.270]  We did an article where people collect the trash in the park and they clean up the park.
[02:23.270 --> 02:25.310]  After they picked up the trash, they got a free joint.
[02:25.310 --> 02:28.630]  It was under my assumption they got the joint at the park because the news made it look
[02:28.630 --> 02:29.630]  that way.
[02:29.630 --> 02:33.590]  I was told that they got a coupon and they had to take the coupon to the smoke club.
[02:33.590 --> 02:38.870]  The smoke club then gave them a joint when they presented proper ID and that coupon.
[02:38.870 --> 02:40.030]  A correction had to be made.
[02:40.030 --> 02:42.230]  They did not give the joints out at the park.
[02:42.230 --> 02:43.230]  They did it correctly.
[02:43.230 --> 02:44.230]  Shout out.
[02:44.230 --> 02:45.350]  Also, shout out to my friends for correcting me.
[02:45.350 --> 02:46.350]  I do appreciate that.
[02:46.350 --> 02:47.350]  All right.
[02:47.350 --> 02:49.430]  I hope everybody had a great week.
[02:49.430 --> 02:50.630]  I am recording on a Saturday.
[02:50.630 --> 02:52.790]  Usually, I record on a Thursday.
[02:52.790 --> 02:53.950]  This week was chaotic.
[02:53.950 --> 02:58.310]  This week on Thursday, I had a medical marijuana doctor at 930 in the morning in Colorado Springs.
[02:58.310 --> 03:01.670]  Then I worked all day and then I went to the secret sesh.
[03:01.670 --> 03:03.790]  The secret sesh was amazing.
[03:03.790 --> 03:05.510]  I almost forgot part of my day.
[03:05.510 --> 03:06.510]  I got up.
[03:06.510 --> 03:07.510]  I drove to Colorado Springs.
[03:07.510 --> 03:09.230]  Then I got stuck in a fucking elevator.
[03:09.230 --> 03:11.510]  Yes, I've never been stuck in an elevator before.
[03:11.790 --> 03:13.030]  On Thursday morning, it happened.
[03:13.030 --> 03:15.710]  I was stuck in an elevator with two strangers.
[03:15.710 --> 03:17.670]  I wasn't in there for very long.
[03:17.670 --> 03:19.670]  It was a little bit freaky, but I didn't panic or anything.
[03:19.670 --> 03:20.670]  I was like, whatever.
[03:20.670 --> 03:21.670]  I'm just in an elevator.
[03:21.670 --> 03:22.670]  People know I'm here.
[03:22.670 --> 03:23.670]  Someone's going to get me out.
[03:23.670 --> 03:24.950]  It wasn't that big of a deal.
[03:24.950 --> 03:28.190]  One of the people in the elevator, it was a couple, and the older dude was getting a
[03:28.190 --> 03:30.470]  little bit pissed off that he was stuck in an elevator.
[03:30.470 --> 03:34.150]  There's no reason for him to be mad, but I think just the simple idea that he was stuck
[03:34.150 --> 03:35.150]  pissed him off.
[03:35.150 --> 03:37.390]  I was going to the medical marijuana doctor.
[03:37.390 --> 03:38.390]  I walked in.
[03:38.390 --> 03:40.830]  There's no stairs at this building, oddly.
[03:41.150 --> 03:42.950]  I was in an elevator, got in the elevator.
[03:42.950 --> 03:43.950]  More people walked in.
[03:43.950 --> 03:44.950]  I held the door for them.
[03:44.950 --> 03:45.950]  I hit floor three.
[03:45.950 --> 03:47.030]  It started to go.
[03:47.030 --> 03:48.910]  It went, and then it stopped.
[03:48.910 --> 03:51.110]  I looked at the dude, and I was like, I don't know that I want to be in here.
[03:51.110 --> 03:52.750]  He said, I think we're stuck in here.
[03:52.750 --> 03:54.470]  I said, if it stops, and then it stopped.
[03:54.470 --> 03:57.670]  I was like, well, shit.
[03:57.670 --> 04:00.710]  My first instinct was try to pull the door open just to see where we are.
[04:00.710 --> 04:01.710]  How far up did we go?
[04:01.710 --> 04:02.710]  How far down did we go?
[04:02.710 --> 04:03.710]  I don't know where the fuck we went.
[04:03.710 --> 04:05.270]  I tried to pull the door open.
[04:05.270 --> 04:06.270]  It was stuck.
[04:06.270 --> 04:07.270]  It was good and stuck.
[04:07.270 --> 04:08.270]  Nothing was going to happen.
[04:08.270 --> 04:10.430]  There's a little alarm button on the elevator.
[04:11.030 --> 04:12.190]  I hit that, and then there's a button that says, call for help.
[04:12.190 --> 04:13.190]  I hit that.
[04:13.190 --> 04:15.750]  A couple seconds later, a young lady answered.
[04:15.750 --> 04:16.750]  She's like, hello.
[04:16.750 --> 04:19.230]  I was like, did I just call the front desk, or what the fuck just happened?
[04:19.230 --> 04:21.190]  I was like, hey, I'm stuck in the elevator.
[04:21.190 --> 04:24.110]  She asked if I was at the address where I was, and I confirmed that.
[04:24.110 --> 04:25.350]  She said, okay, hang tight.
[04:25.350 --> 04:27.310]  We'll send someone to get you out.
[04:27.310 --> 04:29.790]  I was like, well, that's kind of just basic.
[04:29.790 --> 04:31.110]  You know what I mean?
[04:31.110 --> 04:32.110]  Ask if we're okay or some shit.
[04:32.110 --> 04:33.110]  Jeez.
[04:33.110 --> 04:37.150]  We sat in the elevator for a few minutes, and then another person, I kept hitting the
[04:37.150 --> 04:38.150]  little alarm button.
[04:38.150 --> 04:41.030]  It would just go jingle, jingle, jingle so that somebody would know I was in there.
[04:41.030 --> 04:43.030]  Then another person came, and they're like, hey, are you stuck?
[04:43.030 --> 04:44.510]  I was like, yes, we're stuck.
[04:44.510 --> 04:45.830]  She just started pushing buttons.
[04:45.830 --> 04:48.230]  When she pushed, I don't know which button because I wasn't there.
[04:48.230 --> 04:51.350]  When she pushed the button, I could feel the elevator shift a little bit.
[04:51.350 --> 04:53.310]  I said, hey, keep doing that.
[04:53.310 --> 04:57.190]  Then I saw through the crack in the door, I could see that we were only six or eight
[04:57.190 --> 04:58.270]  inches up off the ground.
[04:58.270 --> 04:59.270]  We'd only moved half a foot.
[04:59.270 --> 05:02.870]  I was like, keep doing that because we're going down every time she did it.
[05:02.870 --> 05:07.350]  Then I saw the little threshold piece where the elevator would fit into the floor.
[05:07.550 --> 05:08.550]  I was like, hold on, hold on.
[05:08.550 --> 05:09.550]  I want to see something.
[05:09.550 --> 05:10.550]  Quit pushing it.
[05:10.550 --> 05:11.550]  I didn't want her to squish my fingers.
[05:11.550 --> 05:12.870]  I stuck my fingers in there, and I totally just pulled the door open.
[05:12.870 --> 05:16.190]  I was able to slide the door open once she got it a little bit lower.
[05:16.190 --> 05:20.150]  We were a little bit late for our medical marijuana doctor appointment, but what can
[05:20.150 --> 05:21.150]  you do?
[05:21.150 --> 05:23.190]  I called them, and I said, hey, I'm stuck in the elevator, so please don't screw up
[05:23.190 --> 05:24.190]  my appointment.
[05:24.190 --> 05:25.190]  They took me.
[05:25.190 --> 05:26.190]  They got me in there.
[05:26.190 --> 05:27.190]  Big shout out to my medical marijuana doctor.
[05:27.190 --> 05:31.470]  I don't think I should say his name on the air because he's crowded already.
[05:31.470 --> 05:34.230]  If you know my medical marijuana doctor, you give him a high five.
[05:34.230 --> 05:35.230]  That was quick.
[05:35.230 --> 05:36.230]  It was a quick, easy appointment.
[05:36.230 --> 05:37.710]  Everything handled the way that I needed to.
[05:37.710 --> 05:41.670]  I got out of the elevator, went to the doctor, saw the doctor, went and took care of the
[05:41.670 --> 05:42.670]  gardens all day.
[05:42.670 --> 05:44.030]  Big shout out to John Randall's Jr.
[05:44.030 --> 05:45.030]  Big shout out to Zach.
[05:45.030 --> 05:46.510]  Also, a huge shout out to Hunt.
[05:46.510 --> 05:47.510]  Everybody kicked ass in the garden.
[05:47.510 --> 05:49.350]  Then, you guys, I got to wrap it up.
[05:49.350 --> 05:52.230]  Oh, I went to the dispensary and bought a bunch of Turpex Shatter.
[05:52.230 --> 05:53.230]  Big shout out to Turpex.
[05:53.230 --> 05:55.190]  The new packaging is dope.
[05:55.190 --> 05:56.910]  That Lemon G, I might have grown that.
[05:56.910 --> 06:00.630]  That Lemon G live resin, that stuff was fire, you guys.
[06:00.630 --> 06:01.630]  This stuff was so tasty.
[06:02.630 --> 06:03.630]  Then I went and got some hash.
[06:03.630 --> 06:07.030]  Then, I headed up to Denver where I went to the secret sesh.
[06:07.030 --> 06:08.830]  I met up with our buddy, John Hunt.
[06:08.830 --> 06:12.710]  You guys, I want to give a shout out to everybody that I got to dab with at the secret sesh.
[06:12.710 --> 06:15.790]  I dabbed with so many people that I'm not even going to say one name because I will
[06:15.790 --> 06:16.790]  forget somebody.
[06:16.790 --> 06:19.790]  If you were at secret sesh and we took a dab, much love.
[06:19.790 --> 06:20.790]  I was at the secret sesh.
[06:20.790 --> 06:21.790]  I was dabbing.
[06:21.790 --> 06:24.950]  Adam Mills said, I'm higher than everybody here.
[06:24.950 --> 06:26.910]  I was pretty sure that I was higher than him.
[06:26.910 --> 06:27.910]  I was like, no, you're not.
[06:27.910 --> 06:28.910]  He saw me.
[06:28.910 --> 06:30.270]  He goes, Ross and Jeff, I see you shaking your head.
[06:30.270 --> 06:31.270]  Come here, bro.
[06:31.910 --> 06:32.910]  He called me up to the stage.
[06:32.910 --> 06:33.910]  I went to the stage.
[06:33.910 --> 06:36.630]  His buddy, Tim, gave me, that was at least a gram.
[06:36.630 --> 06:40.190]  I think I took a gram and a half dab on the stage at the secret sesh in front of everybody
[06:40.190 --> 06:41.190]  and did not choke.
[06:41.190 --> 06:43.830]  Then, we brought up a couple of people on the stage and dabbed them out.
[06:43.830 --> 06:45.550]  That was a pretty good time.
[06:45.550 --> 06:49.590]  Honestly, I was lit up because I would give people a two-gram dab and whatever they couldn't
[06:49.590 --> 06:50.990]  take, I would finish it for them.
[06:50.990 --> 06:52.670]  Oftentimes, it was most of a gram.
[06:52.670 --> 06:56.150]  You try to dab somebody a two-gram dab and they start choking and they look at you like,
[06:56.150 --> 06:57.150]  I'm done.
[06:57.150 --> 06:58.150]  I would just grab it and finish it.
[06:58.150 --> 06:59.150]  I was pretty lit.
[06:59.150 --> 07:00.710]  I had a little break and went and sat in the green room.
[07:00.710 --> 07:03.390]  I ate a bunch of Cheetos, drank some Dr. Pepper.
[07:03.390 --> 07:05.910]  I usually don't eat a bunch of crap, but I needed some crap in my body.
[07:05.910 --> 07:08.830]  I ate a bunch of junk and got my shit back together.
[07:08.830 --> 07:12.030]  While I was sitting in the green room chilling out, our good friend, Lindsey, the traveling
[07:12.030 --> 07:13.030]  stoner showed up.
[07:13.030 --> 07:14.750]  She had her beautiful friend, Molly, with her.
[07:14.750 --> 07:16.590]  Shout out to Lindsey and Molly.
[07:16.590 --> 07:19.950]  They encouraged me to have another bag of chips and get my shit together and then get
[07:19.950 --> 07:20.950]  back to the party.
[07:20.950 --> 07:26.030]  Lindsey and our new friend, Molly, and I went and cruised around the secret sesh.
[07:27.030 --> 07:29.790]  Shout out to our friend at TNT Extractions.
[07:29.790 --> 07:33.350]  That dude gave me a donut that got me wrecked.
[07:33.350 --> 07:40.230]  Shout out to whoever made the pink lemonade cupcakes with the peppermint bark on top of
[07:40.230 --> 07:41.230]  them.
[07:41.230 --> 07:43.470]  Sorry, my brain still may be fuzzy from the secret sesh.
[07:43.470 --> 07:47.710]  I think there were 250 or 300 milligrams each and I ate two of those.
[07:47.710 --> 07:49.710]  I had some fruit.
[07:49.710 --> 07:53.270]  There was pineapple and strawberries and some other random fruit that was chopped up that
[07:53.270 --> 07:57.390]  had medicated chocolate ganache that was hot on top of it.
[07:57.390 --> 07:59.390]  That stuff was so tasty.
[07:59.390 --> 08:00.790]  So the secret sesh, I got stupid lit.
[08:00.790 --> 08:04.230]  If you walked up and tried to talk to me and I was kind of non-responsive, I do apologize.
[08:04.230 --> 08:08.750]  I had eaten about 850 to 1,000 milligrams of edibles and I had smoked about four or
[08:08.750 --> 08:09.750]  five grams of hash.
[08:09.750 --> 08:11.750]  So I was in no condition to be conversational.
[08:11.750 --> 08:12.750]  I apologize.
[08:12.750 --> 08:13.750]  But shout out to everyone at the secret sesh.
[08:13.750 --> 08:14.750]  I had a good ass time.
[08:14.750 --> 08:22.230]  Huge shout out to our friends at TNT Extractions and Schumet Edibles.
[08:22.230 --> 08:28.630]  Those dudes gave me a 1,000 milligram edible and I ate that 1,000 milligram edible yesterday
[08:28.630 --> 08:31.110]  on my way to work.
[08:31.110 --> 08:36.090]  And by the time I got to work, it felt like somebody had replaced my blood with sand.
[08:36.090 --> 08:40.390]  My body was so dry and heavy that I just wanted to curl up in a corner and take a nap.
[08:40.390 --> 08:43.990]  I have not been that ridiculously high in a long time.
[08:43.990 --> 08:45.710]  A thousand milligrams is no joke, you guys.
[08:45.710 --> 08:47.150]  I do not recommend it.
[08:47.150 --> 08:48.950]  I don't know that I want to do it again.
[08:48.950 --> 08:53.610]  I feel like I wasted probably a day and a half because the entire day I was useless
[08:53.610 --> 08:57.230]  and then half of today, it took me half of today to get my shit together.
[08:57.230 --> 08:59.830]  So 1,000 milligrams will fuck you up if that's what you're looking for.
[08:59.830 --> 09:01.310]  But oh my God, I don't recommend it.
[09:01.310 --> 09:02.310]  It was an adventure.
[09:02.310 --> 09:05.270]  It was like a shamanic journey.
[09:05.270 --> 09:06.950]  But I had to go and live my day doing it.
[09:06.950 --> 09:08.910]  I had to go to work and I had to function.
[09:08.910 --> 09:09.950]  So that was kind of hard.
[09:09.950 --> 09:13.030]  Don't do that unless you can lay around and just be lazy.
[09:13.030 --> 09:14.030]  So shout out to those folks.
[09:14.030 --> 09:15.030]  Shout out to the secret sesh.
[09:15.030 --> 09:17.650]  You guys, if you can make it to the next secret sesh, you need to be there.
[09:17.650 --> 09:19.130]  Big shout out to Adam Mill and all those kids.
[09:19.130 --> 09:23.210]  I'm not going to try to list names because I will forget mad people, but we're going
[09:23.210 --> 09:24.210]  to move forward.
[09:24.210 --> 09:27.210]  And you guys, I want to get into some iTunes comments.
[09:27.210 --> 09:28.850]  We haven't read the iTunes comments in a long time.
[09:28.850 --> 09:31.670]  I think there are one or two more that we haven't read.
[09:31.670 --> 09:33.530]  So I'm pulling up iTunes right now.
[09:33.530 --> 09:35.890]  I'm getting to the comment section.
[09:35.890 --> 09:40.970]  I would like it if you guys would go to iTunes, go to the iTunes store, search for the Grow
[09:40.970 --> 09:45.010]  From Your Heart podcast, find the review section, type in a little comment, give me the amount
[09:45.010 --> 09:47.370]  of stars that you feel I deserve, and let me know what you think about the show because
[09:47.370 --> 09:49.330]  I really do appreciate reading the comments.
[09:49.330 --> 09:50.330]  All right.
[09:50.330 --> 09:51.330]  I am here.
[09:51.330 --> 09:52.330]  I'm where I need to be.
[09:52.330 --> 09:53.330]  I found the new comments.
[09:53.330 --> 09:55.250]  Our new comment comes from our friend Tarantula Hawk.
[09:55.250 --> 09:56.250]  He gave us five stars.
[09:56.250 --> 09:58.490]  He left this comment May 18th, 2016.
[09:58.490 --> 10:00.330]  And the comment goes like this.
[10:00.330 --> 10:04.330]  To date, this is hands down the best informational cannabis grow podcast.
[10:04.330 --> 10:07.330]  Rasta Jeff doesn't overload you with endless advertising.
[10:07.330 --> 10:09.690]  Informative, free, and entertaining.
[10:09.690 --> 10:11.130]  Much love to Jeff and the crew.
[10:11.130 --> 10:12.290]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[10:12.290 --> 10:15.090]  If you like it, review it and donate a few bucks.
[10:15.090 --> 10:16.090]  Right up.
[10:16.090 --> 10:17.090]  It's that good.
[10:17.090 --> 10:18.770]  That is a hell of a good comment.
[10:18.770 --> 10:19.770]  Thank you.
[10:19.770 --> 10:20.770]  I appreciate that.
[10:20.770 --> 10:25.690]  That's something I noticed when I used to listen to another cannabis podcast.
[10:25.690 --> 10:29.750]  People would ask a grow question and instead of giving solid grow advice, the host of that
[10:29.750 --> 10:33.410]  show would sell you a product and it wouldn't solve your problem.
[10:33.410 --> 10:35.070]  It would temporarily solve your problem.
[10:35.070 --> 10:37.170]  It would mask your problem is what it would do.
[10:37.170 --> 10:38.650]  And then you'd have to keep buying that product.
[10:38.650 --> 10:42.370]  What I like to do is if you have a problem in your grow, if you say, hey, I have spider
[10:42.370 --> 10:45.450]  mites, I like to help you figure out how you're getting spider mites, teach you how
[10:45.450 --> 10:48.930]  to correct that so that you don't ever get mites again, instead of having to buy some
[10:48.930 --> 10:51.450]  product that is sponsoring me over and over again.
[10:51.450 --> 10:52.730]  I don't think that's cool.
[10:52.730 --> 10:57.970]  So I do appreciate that you noticed that, uh, free and entertaining and informative.
[10:57.970 --> 10:59.450]  That's those are the things I aim to be.
[10:59.450 --> 11:00.450]  So perfect.
[11:00.450 --> 11:01.450]  Awesome.
[11:01.450 --> 11:02.450]  Thank you.
[11:02.450 --> 11:03.450]  Uh, much love to me and the crew.
[11:03.450 --> 11:04.450]  I will share the love with the crew.
[11:04.450 --> 11:05.450]  Hopefully they're all listening right now.
[11:05.450 --> 11:08.490]  So you guys, this dude, tarantula hog gave us mad love and then give your mom a hug for
[11:08.490 --> 11:09.490]  me.
[11:09.490 --> 11:11.010]  I will do that and then review it.
[11:11.010 --> 11:12.010]  Yes.
[11:12.010 --> 11:15.650]  Go to podcasts, go to iTunes and leave a review, just like this guy says, and then also donate
[11:15.650 --> 11:16.650]  a few bucks.
[11:16.650 --> 11:20.970]  Unfortunately, PayPal did not like me having a cannabis related podcast linked to their
[11:20.970 --> 11:21.970]  PayPal service.
[11:21.970 --> 11:23.730]  So PayPal has shut me down.
[11:23.730 --> 11:27.730]  I do not have a way to receive donations, but if you'd like to make a contribution to
[11:27.730 --> 11:31.550]  the show, send me an email, grow from your heart at hotmail.com.
[11:31.550 --> 11:33.970]  We will figure out how to receive your contribution.
[11:33.970 --> 11:34.970]  All right.
[11:34.970 --> 11:36.690]  So big shout out to tarantula hockey.
[11:36.690 --> 11:40.250]  He gave us a five-star rating and wrote a super, super sweet comment.
[11:40.250 --> 11:41.370]  I appreciate that.
[11:41.370 --> 11:44.570]  Our next comment comes from 100% Clint.
[11:44.570 --> 11:47.890]  And I don't know if that's Clint that's been on the show or if that's just a listener,
[11:47.890 --> 11:52.470]  but they gave us a five-star review and they left a comment on May 20th of 2016.
[11:52.470 --> 11:55.310]  And it simply says, give your mom a hug for me.
[11:55.310 --> 11:59.050]  So next time I see my mom, I owe her two hugs and I want you guys to do the same.
[11:59.050 --> 12:00.890]  Next time you see your mom, just give her a hug for me.
[12:00.890 --> 12:02.730]  Tell her Rasta Jeff says, hello.
[12:02.730 --> 12:03.730]  She knows who I am.
[12:03.730 --> 12:04.730]  Trust me.
[12:04.730 --> 12:06.450]  All right, you guys, that was the iTunes comments.
[12:06.450 --> 12:09.130]  I want to thank everybody that sent a comment.
[12:09.130 --> 12:13.130]  I encourage you to go to iTunes, like I said, and post a little comment, post a review.
[12:13.130 --> 12:14.250]  I would truly appreciate it.
[12:14.250 --> 12:16.690]  If you've got something you'd like to say and you don't want to do it on the iTunes
[12:16.690 --> 12:18.570]  comments, you can always send me an email.
[12:18.570 --> 12:19.570]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[12:19.570 --> 12:22.810]  And of course I am on all of the social media.
[12:22.810 --> 12:23.810]  I'm on Facebook.
[12:23.810 --> 12:24.810]  I'm on Instagram.
[12:24.810 --> 12:25.810]  I'm on Twitter.
[12:25.810 --> 12:26.810]  I'm on Snapchat.
[12:26.810 --> 12:27.810]  Find me, support all of those.
[12:27.810 --> 12:28.810]  I would appreciate that.
[12:28.810 --> 12:32.970]  And speaking of social media, a couple of days ago, I saw a post from my friend, Nicole
[12:32.970 --> 12:33.970]  West.
[12:33.970 --> 12:34.970]  Big shout out to Nicole.
[12:34.970 --> 12:38.090]  Nicole is, um, she's well-established in the cannabis industry.
[12:38.090 --> 12:39.090]  Let's just say that.
[12:39.090 --> 12:42.090]  She posted something to Facebook that I thought I would share with you guys.
[12:42.090 --> 12:47.330]  It says, dear people applying for jobs in the cannabis industry, just a few tips and
[12:47.330 --> 12:49.090]  I can support everything she says here.
[12:49.090 --> 12:53.250]  Tip number one, please do not make the first sentence of your intro email be, I can pass
[12:53.250 --> 12:55.490]  a drug test.
[12:55.490 --> 12:57.130]  That should be self-explanatory, you guys.
[12:57.130 --> 13:00.990]  Number two, if you failed at attaching the correct document or attaching the document
[13:00.990 --> 13:05.410]  correctly the first three times, I don't think the fourth time is going to get you your job.
[13:05.850 --> 13:10.210]  Guys, when you're going to attach, when you send in your resume to work at a dispensary,
[13:10.210 --> 13:13.490]  you need to include a copy of your badge and probably a copy of your ID.
[13:13.490 --> 13:16.890]  And there will probably be more documents attached that shit.
[13:16.890 --> 13:18.570]  Don't forget to attach your resume.
[13:18.570 --> 13:20.750]  Don't forget, send it right the first time.
[13:20.750 --> 13:22.890]  Also you guys, I heard a friend talking about this.
[13:22.890 --> 13:28.010]  A friend of mine got an email that was addressed to the wrong person.
[13:28.010 --> 13:29.130]  My friend's name is Lee.
[13:29.130 --> 13:34.450]  The email said, Hey Brian, this indicates to me and Lee that this email was a mass email
[13:34.490 --> 13:37.890]  sent to multiple people and all the person was doing was going and changing the name
[13:37.890 --> 13:40.130]  is who the letter was addressed to.
[13:40.130 --> 13:41.730]  You guys make sure you change that shit.
[13:41.730 --> 13:46.250]  If you're sending an application or a resume, don't say dear live well when you're trying
[13:46.250 --> 13:49.210]  to work for the clinic, make sure you get that shit correct.
[13:49.210 --> 13:53.810]  So number three, do not ask me to how to get a badge in your intro email.
[13:53.810 --> 13:54.810]  That's the truth.
[13:54.810 --> 13:58.130]  If you're applying for a job, do not ask the person giving you the job how to get your
[13:58.130 --> 13:59.490]  badge that's on you.
[13:59.490 --> 14:02.050]  I've done a whole episode on how to get your badge.
[14:02.050 --> 14:03.290]  Go back and listen to that.
[14:03.290 --> 14:04.810]  That'll truly help you out.
[14:04.810 --> 14:08.690]  Number four, please do not spend the entire interview talking about how shitty the last
[14:08.690 --> 14:11.930]  dispensary you worked for treated everyone.
[14:11.930 --> 14:12.930]  Don't do that.
[14:12.930 --> 14:15.010]  You guys, if you work for another dispensary and you're trying to work for ours, we don't
[14:15.010 --> 14:17.250]  want to hear about the problems at the old place.
[14:17.250 --> 14:18.250]  That means that you're dramatic.
[14:18.250 --> 14:21.890]  That means that you're going to bring some bullshit to our place that we simply do not
[14:21.890 --> 14:25.810]  need to keep your drama at home, especially during an interview.
[14:25.810 --> 14:28.850]  Number five, no basic weights and measurements.
[14:28.850 --> 14:33.130]  If you're coming to work at a dispensary, know what an eighth weighs, know what a quarter
[14:33.130 --> 14:38.170]  weighs, know what a half ounce weighs, know what an ounce weighs, know this shit, know
[14:38.170 --> 14:41.050]  it well, start understanding weights.
[14:41.050 --> 14:42.050]  You need to be quick.
[14:42.050 --> 14:43.530]  You need, you should be able to eyeball an eighth.
[14:43.530 --> 14:46.130]  You should be able to throw an eighth on the scale just by grabbing it and tossing it on
[14:46.130 --> 14:47.130]  there.
[14:47.130 --> 14:48.130]  Get good at that shit.
[14:48.130 --> 14:50.250]  You guys, 3.5 grams is an eighth.
[14:50.250 --> 14:53.050]  There are 28.35 grams in an ounce.
[14:53.050 --> 14:54.330]  That 0.35 does matter.
[14:54.330 --> 14:55.810]  Most people skip the 28.35.
[14:55.810 --> 14:58.690]  28.35 is a true ounce, you guys.
[14:58.690 --> 15:00.650]  So do your math from there.
[15:00.650 --> 15:02.410]  All right.
[15:02.410 --> 15:06.610]  Then number six, regardless of the job you're applying for, always dress professional at
[15:06.610 --> 15:08.450]  interviews.
[15:08.450 --> 15:11.130]  Even if you're coming in to be a trimmer, even if you're coming in just to be an entry
[15:11.130 --> 15:14.170]  level person at a dispensary, look good.
[15:14.170 --> 15:15.490]  You need to look presentable.
[15:15.490 --> 15:19.370]  You'll be around products that people are going to buy and consume.
[15:19.370 --> 15:22.530]  People don't want scuzzy people hovering over their cake or their baked goods.
[15:22.530 --> 15:26.450]  You don't want scuzzy people hovering over the medicine that you're going to smoke, especially
[15:26.450 --> 15:27.730]  in a medical dispensary.
[15:27.770 --> 15:28.770]  We need clean people.
[15:28.770 --> 15:30.330]  We need a clean environment.
[15:30.330 --> 15:33.490]  So you guys, those were a few tips that my friend Nicole posted to Facebook.
[15:33.490 --> 15:36.090]  I thought it would be really helpful to share this.
[15:36.090 --> 15:40.730]  It's kind of a smart ass stab at people trying to get a job, but it's so real that it was
[15:40.730 --> 15:41.730]  worth sharing.
[15:41.730 --> 15:43.330]  So she meant to post something smart ass.
[15:43.330 --> 15:46.010]  I took it seriously because some people need some help with this.
[15:46.010 --> 15:47.010]  I thought it would be helpful.
[15:47.010 --> 15:48.790]  So big shout out to Nicole West, you guys.
[15:48.790 --> 15:50.570]  My throat is getting dry as shit.
[15:50.570 --> 15:53.930]  So this is the point in the show where I'm going to press pause, take a couple of dabs,
[15:53.930 --> 15:55.930]  take a drink, and I will be right back.
[15:56.930 --> 15:59.370]  Yeah, I'm back and I am dabbed the fuck out.
[15:59.370 --> 16:03.130]  You guys, I need to give a huge shout out to my friends at Elevate Glass at 517 South
[16:03.130 --> 16:06.530]  Tejon in beautiful downtown Colorado Springs, Colorado.
[16:06.530 --> 16:08.270]  Make sure you check out Elevate Glass.
[16:08.270 --> 16:12.070]  If you need a new rig, if you need a new nail, if you need some smoking accessories, I highly
[16:12.070 --> 16:13.890]  recommend Elevate Glass.
[16:13.890 --> 16:14.890]  Go check them out.
[16:14.890 --> 16:17.530]  Also, one more important thing I need to mention, you guys, I've said this before.
[16:17.530 --> 16:21.830]  I need to remind you again, politely, kindly, I'm not mad at you, but I cannot ship anybody
[16:21.830 --> 16:23.570]  any seeds at this time.
[16:23.570 --> 16:25.690]  I do not send seeds.
[16:25.730 --> 16:30.970]  If you're looking for seeds, I can recommend that you search the internet for thedankteam.com.
[16:30.970 --> 16:34.410]  The D-A-N-K team, dankteam.com.
[16:34.410 --> 16:35.410]  Check them out.
[16:35.410 --> 16:39.130]  They may be able to help you out, but I certainly cannot get you any seeds.
[16:39.130 --> 16:41.210]  All right, you guys, that's enough business.
[16:41.210 --> 16:43.670]  Let's get to an email that I received.
[16:43.670 --> 16:44.970]  This one came from our friend Seb.
[16:44.970 --> 16:46.850]  Shout out to Rasta Seb down there in Australia.
[16:46.850 --> 16:48.290]  Thank you for listening to the show.
[16:48.290 --> 16:49.670]  Thank you for supporting the show.
[16:49.670 --> 16:52.370]  Thank you for being the coolest Facebook troll ever.
[16:52.370 --> 16:53.370]  Thanks for hanging out.
[16:53.370 --> 16:54.370]  It feels like we're bros.
[16:54.370 --> 16:55.690]  We hang out, we get around and smoke together.
[16:55.690 --> 16:58.490]  I've never met the dude in person, but he is family now.
[16:58.490 --> 16:59.490]  Big shout out to Seb.
[16:59.490 --> 17:00.490]  Cool ass dude.
[17:00.490 --> 17:01.490]  Make sure you follow Rasta Seb on Facebook.
[17:01.490 --> 17:04.690]  Let him know that you found out about him through the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[17:04.690 --> 17:05.690]  He's a cool ass dude.
[17:05.690 --> 17:08.330]  He makes some really funny memes.
[17:08.330 --> 17:11.130]  Sometimes I act like I don't see them because I don't even know what the fuck to say.
[17:11.130 --> 17:14.130]  He sent me a long Facebook message with several questions.
[17:14.130 --> 17:16.370]  I'm going to go through a couple of them here.
[17:16.370 --> 17:22.770]  The first one, he says, how can a humble, simple ganja farmer folk avoid buying an RO
[17:22.770 --> 17:24.570]  and get rid of chloramides?
[17:24.570 --> 17:30.450]  He's asking how he can get rid of the chlorine and whatever else the water company is putting
[17:30.450 --> 17:35.290]  in your water without buying a reverse osmosis machine because those are quite expensive
[17:35.290 --> 17:37.110]  and sometimes people can't afford that.
[17:37.110 --> 17:39.250]  Sometimes you don't have anywhere to put it.
[17:39.250 --> 17:44.410]  How can a simple ganja farmer get rid of the chlorine and the stuff that the city is putting
[17:44.410 --> 17:47.050]  in our municipal water?
[17:47.050 --> 17:51.310]  Quite simply, you can put it in a giant jug and set it in the sun and the sun will help
[17:51.310 --> 17:53.670]  evaporate off any of those contaminants.
[17:53.670 --> 17:57.430]  Also, I recommend putting, if you need to do it indoors, if you have to do it indoors,
[17:57.430 --> 18:02.390]  most of us have to, put the tap water in a reservoir, whatever size you're using, and
[18:02.390 --> 18:04.350]  put a lot of air stones in there.
[18:04.350 --> 18:07.750]  Put air stones in there and make it bubble real heavily because then you'll move all
[18:07.750 --> 18:11.910]  that water around and surface area, excuse me for clearing my throat over and over again,
[18:11.910 --> 18:14.230]  but surface area is what you're trying to create.
[18:14.230 --> 18:16.950]  You want to bring some of that water from the bottom up to the top and help move some
[18:16.950 --> 18:21.150]  of that chlorine that's trapped in there up to the top and then it can evaporate.
[18:21.150 --> 18:25.390]  The easiest way is just to put your water in a big container and put air stones in it
[18:25.390 --> 18:26.390]  and bubble the shit out of it.
[18:26.390 --> 18:30.310]  Get yourself a nice air bubbler, what do they call it, an air pump.
[18:30.310 --> 18:32.070]  Just get yourself a nice powerful one.
[18:32.070 --> 18:35.470]  They make one that's got like eight air things coming off of it.
[18:35.470 --> 18:39.390]  Put all eight of them in like a 30 gallon trash can and fill that sucker with water
[18:39.390 --> 18:42.470]  and just pump the shit out of the air into there and that'll get rid of the chlorine
[18:42.470 --> 18:44.670]  or the chloramide or whatever you're worried about in there.
[18:44.670 --> 18:46.510]  We'll get rid of most of it.
[18:46.510 --> 18:49.550]  And then of course, before you give that to your plants, make sure you adjust the pH.
[18:49.550 --> 18:52.590]  Check the pH of that, adjust it before you feed it to your plants.
[18:52.590 --> 18:55.430]  Depending on the plant's age, their pH, they will want different stuff.
[18:55.430 --> 18:58.390]  So that's how you can get rid of that stuff and it's free and it doesn't take much but
[18:58.390 --> 19:00.150]  time and a little bit of energy.
[19:00.150 --> 19:03.030]  You may have to go buy yourself an air pump.
[19:03.030 --> 19:08.990]  The second question Seb asked is, thoughts on mycorrhiza and trichoderma bacteria beneficials,
[19:08.990 --> 19:11.950]  do you use and how much?
[19:11.950 --> 19:15.590]  So he wants to know which of these beneficials I use and how much.
[19:15.590 --> 19:16.790]  There are several brands out there.
[19:16.790 --> 19:19.510]  They're mostly the same, you guys.
[19:19.510 --> 19:20.870]  There are several brands that I like.
[19:20.870 --> 19:23.310]  I really like Great White Shark.
[19:23.310 --> 19:24.950]  Sometimes I like OG BioWar.
[19:24.950 --> 19:26.230]  I like a lot of different things.
[19:26.230 --> 19:30.150]  The chunkier white ones seem to work the best for me.
[19:30.150 --> 19:31.150]  How much?
[19:31.150 --> 19:32.150]  A whole bunch.
[19:32.150 --> 19:35.830]  When I put my, when my seedlings come or when my clones come out of the cloner and they're
[19:35.830 --> 19:39.910]  going into a cup of soil or a small pot of soil, I like to sprinkle a little bit of the
[19:39.910 --> 19:44.390]  Great White Shark around the base area where the roots are going to hit and then put, or
[19:44.390 --> 19:49.270]  also I can't forget this one, Dragonfly Earth Medicine, they make a Lush Roots is also a
[19:49.350 --> 19:50.950]  great product for this.
[19:50.950 --> 19:54.470]  Dust the roots in there or put a little right where the roots are going to go and then bury
[19:54.470 --> 19:58.870]  the plant into that and then when I, I let the roots grow in that cup or small container
[19:58.870 --> 20:02.630]  for a long time until it's almost too much and then I transplant it into the next container
[20:02.630 --> 20:06.790]  and as I do, I'll coat right where I'm going to put the plant, I'll coat that area with
[20:06.790 --> 20:11.790]  just a sprinkle of whatever powdered root inoculant sort of thing that I'm going to
[20:11.790 --> 20:12.790]  use.
[20:12.790 --> 20:17.190]  If it's Great White Shark, if it's OG BioWar, whichever brand you're using, you can use
[20:17.190 --> 20:18.190]  OGT.
[20:18.190 --> 20:19.190]  They're a whole bunch of different products.
[20:19.190 --> 20:20.830]  They're mostly the same.
[20:20.830 --> 20:22.310]  I really like the Great White Shark.
[20:22.310 --> 20:23.310]  It's affordable.
[20:23.310 --> 20:24.310]  It's cost effective.
[20:24.310 --> 20:25.310]  OG BioWar is affordable.
[20:25.310 --> 20:26.310]  It's cost effective.
[20:26.310 --> 20:28.150]  It's worth its weight in gold in my opinion.
[20:28.150 --> 20:32.110]  So those would be the two I'd recommend, the Great White Shark or the OG BioWar and you
[20:32.110 --> 20:33.110]  can't use too much.
[20:33.110 --> 20:37.230]  Use it when you go from the cloner into the cup and then when you go from the cup into
[20:37.230 --> 20:41.710]  the pot and then if you go into another pot, do it again every time.
[20:41.710 --> 20:44.550]  Right where you're putting those roots, the fresh roots, just put some of that into the
[20:44.550 --> 20:46.590]  dirt right where those roots are going to touch.
[20:46.590 --> 20:51.190]  And then I like to fill a container with clean water and then I just mix the powdered
[20:51.190 --> 20:55.790]  solution into the water with my nutrients and feed it to the plants just like a water
[20:55.790 --> 20:59.310]  feed, just like I feed all my other nutrients and I feel that that helps soak it in there
[20:59.310 --> 21:00.310]  real good.
[21:00.310 --> 21:03.830]  So now I've got some that was in there with the roots when I put it in there in the dirt,
[21:03.830 --> 21:07.070]  it's already touching it, the roots are eating it and then I feed some in kind of like a
[21:07.070 --> 21:08.790]  tea so that it can get more.
[21:08.790 --> 21:10.950]  I really like to give it that sort of stuff.
[21:10.950 --> 21:15.630]  Give it all, give it, excuse me, once again, give it, give it these things all through
[21:15.670 --> 21:21.830]  the veg phase, like maybe once every other week through the veg phase and then do it.
[21:21.830 --> 21:26.350]  The first three weeks in flower would not be a bad idea at all because you want to build
[21:26.350 --> 21:28.510]  those roots and keep those roots moving.
[21:28.510 --> 21:35.350]  So I hope that answers your question, dude, which, uh, which beneficials do I recommend?
[21:35.350 --> 21:39.830]  So the next question you said, my thoughts on led lights, the benefits you're thinking
[21:39.830 --> 21:44.150]  better trichome production, maybe if used in conjunction with HBS, not to mention energy
[21:44.150 --> 21:47.710]  savings 10 to one for similar lumens output.
[21:47.710 --> 21:50.870]  Um, I've seen a lot of great shit come from led lights.
[21:50.870 --> 21:53.110]  I don't have any experience with them.
[21:53.110 --> 21:57.630]  Honestly, they're expensive and I'm afraid to invest in a light that's not going to make
[21:57.630 --> 22:00.030]  my plants perform the way that they need.
[22:00.030 --> 22:05.510]  Um, in the right situation, if you're in a small area and you can't run a big light,
[22:05.510 --> 22:06.510]  do it.
[22:06.510 --> 22:08.950]  Uh, if what you're able to do is run an led, run an led.
[22:08.950 --> 22:12.750]  My friend Amanda has an led and I've seen pictures of her cannabis plants and they look
[22:12.750 --> 22:13.750]  good.
[22:13.750 --> 22:16.070]  Um, I can't argue with the led.
[22:16.070 --> 22:19.830]  My friend Nancy Budwell, I don't know if she listens to this podcast, but shout out to
[22:19.830 --> 22:20.830]  Nancy.
[22:20.830 --> 22:23.770]  She grows with a lush led and her plants look fucking stellar.
[22:23.770 --> 22:25.390]  Her plants look really, really good.
[22:25.390 --> 22:26.390]  She does a great job.
[22:26.390 --> 22:28.030]  I've seen a lot of great stuff from leds.
[22:28.030 --> 22:31.630]  I just don't have any experience.
[22:31.630 --> 22:34.830]  You are totally accurate with the cost effectiveness of leds.
[22:34.830 --> 22:37.030]  They really do keep electricity costs down.
[22:37.030 --> 22:40.830]  The lights themselves don't pull as much power, which means they don't make as much heat,
[22:40.830 --> 22:43.910]  which means you don't need as much air conditioning.
[22:43.910 --> 22:44.910]  So it's really beneficial.
[22:44.910 --> 22:45.910]  It is a good thing.
[22:45.910 --> 22:50.950]  Uh, if you get the right leds, I'm sure that there are some cheap China made ones out there
[22:50.950 --> 22:52.150]  that you wouldn't want to purchase.
[22:52.150 --> 22:56.350]  I'm sure there are some great American made leds that would work very well.
[22:56.350 --> 22:58.230]  So just do your research.
[22:58.230 --> 23:01.110]  If you're going to buy an led, I guess that's the best I could say on their tricone production.
[23:01.110 --> 23:04.430]  Yeah, it's going to help you out with tricone production because you're getting more types
[23:04.430 --> 23:05.430]  of light.
[23:05.430 --> 23:08.070]  It's going to make the plants grow a little bit differently.
[23:08.070 --> 23:10.750]  Also it's going to change the gosh, I'm sorry you guys.
[23:10.790 --> 23:13.750]  I'm just choking up over here.
[23:13.750 --> 23:16.150]  It's going to change the nutritive cycle of that plant a little bit.
[23:16.150 --> 23:19.750]  It's going to speed it up a little bit I feel like because it's getting more different light.
[23:19.750 --> 23:21.750]  So you're going to probably need to feed a little bit differently.
[23:21.750 --> 23:26.390]  There'll be adjustments to be made if you shift shift from an HPS to an led or if you
[23:26.390 --> 23:30.470]  add an led to your HPS room, you're going to see different shit happening that you're
[23:30.470 --> 23:31.990]  going to have to adjust to.
[23:31.990 --> 23:38.870]  I saw sub cool hang a lush led in his HPS room and the plant underneath it hated it,
[23:39.070 --> 23:41.510]  that's just because it wasn't sub cools grow style.
[23:41.510 --> 23:43.510]  So you're going to have to adjust some shit.
[23:43.510 --> 23:46.430]  I hope that answered your question about leds in my opinion.
[23:46.430 --> 23:52.390]  So the next one is why I want to ask why more commercial grows don't get solar to offset
[23:52.390 --> 23:54.910]  massive power costs.
[23:54.910 --> 23:59.790]  Honestly at the amount of electricity we're using, I don't know that solar would even
[23:59.790 --> 24:01.510]  be a viable source.
[24:01.510 --> 24:03.390]  I honestly don't know enough about solar.
[24:03.390 --> 24:05.790]  That's something I would have to research.
[24:05.790 --> 24:13.710]  But honestly, we've got 85 1000 watt lights in one room and 25 1000 watt lights in another
[24:13.710 --> 24:15.110]  room.
[24:15.110 --> 24:17.390]  The electricity bill is high dude.
[24:17.390 --> 24:23.510]  And we've also got shit, tons, tons and tons of air conditioning on top of that building
[24:23.510 --> 24:26.310]  that just keep us cool all day.
[24:26.310 --> 24:27.310]  It was really warm today.
[24:27.310 --> 24:28.310]  Well, not really warm.
[24:28.310 --> 24:29.870]  It was fairly warm today outside.
[24:29.870 --> 24:32.270]  It's going to get way hotter, but it was fairly warm.
[24:32.270 --> 24:33.670]  And the building was nice and cool.
[24:33.670 --> 24:35.630]  It was probably 74 degrees in the whole building.
[24:35.630 --> 24:36.990]  And we've got a nice office space.
[24:36.990 --> 24:37.990]  We've got a trim area.
[24:37.990 --> 24:39.590]  So there's a shit ton of lights.
[24:39.590 --> 24:42.430]  I don't think that motorcycle was so loud.
[24:42.430 --> 24:44.830]  I hope you guys heard that because it kind of scared the shit out of me.
[24:44.830 --> 24:50.430]  I don't think that we could get enough electricity through solar to run all of the stuff that
[24:50.430 --> 24:55.870]  we have all of course, I am not an electrical engineer or anywhere educated in any means
[24:55.870 --> 24:56.870]  of solar power.
[24:56.870 --> 24:57.870]  But that's my opinion.
[24:57.870 --> 24:58.870]  That's what I would assume.
[24:58.870 --> 24:59.870]  That's what I would guess, dude.
[24:59.870 --> 25:04.470]  And then he asked me question number five, Seb said, how do you keep so cool under pressure
[25:04.470 --> 25:06.310]  when the cop pulled you over?
[25:06.310 --> 25:09.870]  And then he also said being responsible for so much medicine and patients as it does it
[25:09.870 --> 25:12.830]  keep you awake at night worrying about timers and stuff.
[25:12.830 --> 25:16.430]  Any tips on how to relax and not freak out like I tend to?
[25:16.430 --> 25:18.310]  Well, shit, bro.
[25:18.310 --> 25:22.150]  I didn't worry about timers and stuff until you just pointed it out.
[25:22.150 --> 25:25.990]  Now I'm having a damn panic attack and I want to check the cameras on my phone and see if
[25:25.990 --> 25:27.310]  everything at the grow is cool.
[25:27.310 --> 25:28.310]  And I'm just kidding.
[25:28.310 --> 25:29.310]  I'm just totally joking with you.
[25:29.750 --> 25:31.110]  How do I keep my cool under pressure?
[25:31.110 --> 25:32.830]  Like when that cop pulled me over?
[25:32.830 --> 25:37.950]  Well, I'm a grown ass adult and that cop's just a grown ass man with a job to do.
[25:37.950 --> 25:39.830]  And I didn't have anything to hide.
[25:39.830 --> 25:45.430]  And I guess being a white dude with a nice car probably helped me out.
[25:45.430 --> 25:48.110]  So I didn't feel like I was worried about too much.
[25:48.110 --> 25:50.550]  And because I mean, we know I'm not even kidding.
[25:50.550 --> 25:53.150]  If I was a different race, it could have been a totally different outcome.
[25:53.150 --> 25:55.990]  I'm not accusing this cop of anything, but we know how things go.
[25:55.990 --> 25:57.990]  So being a spoiled white dude helps me out for sure.
[25:57.990 --> 26:00.750]  In that case, keeping my cool with the cops.
[26:00.750 --> 26:05.230]  And I'm just well educated and I speak well and I'm very sociable.
[26:05.230 --> 26:06.230]  So I don't worry about cops.
[26:06.230 --> 26:08.030]  They're just people with a job to do.
[26:08.030 --> 26:12.070]  And if you're not doing anything stupid and hiding anything, most of the time you should
[26:12.070 --> 26:13.670]  be cool, I feel like.
[26:13.670 --> 26:15.870]  And so I just, I hoped for that.
[26:15.870 --> 26:18.190]  I guess that's how I stayed cool with the cops.
[26:18.190 --> 26:20.230]  Honestly, I'm not intimidated by people.
[26:20.230 --> 26:21.630]  People are people.
[26:21.630 --> 26:26.670]  If the person next to me is Rasta Seb, if the person next to me is white Mike, if the
[26:26.670 --> 26:31.630]  person sitting next to me is Lindsey, or if the person sitting next to me is the president,
[26:31.630 --> 26:36.110]  or if the person sitting next to me is whoever, I feel the same.
[26:36.110 --> 26:37.110]  They're people.
[26:37.110 --> 26:38.110]  We're all humans.
[26:38.110 --> 26:39.110]  We all fart.
[26:39.110 --> 26:40.110]  We all poop.
[26:40.110 --> 26:41.110]  We all have to go pee.
[26:41.110 --> 26:42.110]  We all need to eat food to live life.
[26:42.110 --> 26:43.110]  We all have feelings.
[26:43.110 --> 26:44.110]  We're all just people.
[26:44.110 --> 26:45.110]  So I don't, people don't make me nervous.
[26:45.110 --> 26:47.710]  Like we're all just people like rock stars are just people that play guitars real well.
[26:47.710 --> 26:49.230]  I don't get nervous around people.
[26:49.230 --> 26:51.710]  So that's how I keep cool in that situation.
[26:51.710 --> 26:56.390]  The part about being responsible for so much medicine and patients and does it keep me
[26:56.390 --> 26:57.710]  awake at night?
[26:57.710 --> 27:03.070]  No, because I wouldn't be in the position if the people that put me, that let me have
[27:03.070 --> 27:05.830]  this position didn't have full trust of me.
[27:05.830 --> 27:09.790]  And I would not, I wouldn't even do it if I didn't have faith in myself that I could
[27:09.790 --> 27:10.790]  do this.
[27:10.790 --> 27:12.710]  I would say straight up like, Hey, this is not my thing.
[27:12.710 --> 27:14.270]  I can't handle this.
[27:14.270 --> 27:16.230]  And also I've got good backup.
[27:16.230 --> 27:19.630]  It is my, I do run that grow by myself for the most part.
[27:19.630 --> 27:22.550]  But if I need help, I can call hunt, hunt, we'll come help.
[27:22.550 --> 27:23.550]  I can call Zach.
[27:23.550 --> 27:24.550]  Zach will come help.
[27:24.550 --> 27:28.030]  I have a trimmer that's there trimming eight days a week now.
[27:28.030 --> 27:31.430]  So I can have him help me if there is trouble in the grow that I need help with.
[27:31.430 --> 27:34.750]  So yeah, I am responsible for it, but it doesn't keep me awake at night.
[27:34.750 --> 27:36.110]  I've got it figured out.
[27:36.110 --> 27:37.470]  I know the building really well.
[27:37.470 --> 27:38.910]  I know every timer in the building.
[27:38.910 --> 27:42.430]  I know what time everything clicks on, what time everything clicks off.
[27:42.430 --> 27:45.130]  I know what the temperature is in each room right now.
[27:45.130 --> 27:47.950]  So I don't worry too much about that.
[27:48.270 --> 27:53.790]  And then you said, does it keep you awake at night worrying about timers and stuff?
[27:53.790 --> 27:59.030]  So one time, dude, it was late, it was midnight and I was laying down to go to sleep and I
[27:59.030 --> 28:02.390]  thought I should check the cameras at the grow just to see what's going on.
[28:02.390 --> 28:05.630]  And it's an hour away from my house in good weather.
[28:05.630 --> 28:09.630]  So I look at the camera and I can see that this one pump has broken.
[28:09.630 --> 28:14.870]  I can see it on the camera that a tank that should have been fed to these plants was totally
[28:14.870 --> 28:20.470]  full and the pump had not pumped in several hours, probably six good hours.
[28:20.470 --> 28:25.110]  And if these plants didn't get a drink of water within the next three or four hours,
[28:25.110 --> 28:27.390]  it probably were going to die.
[28:27.390 --> 28:30.230]  And it was midnight and I was getting ready to go to bed and I saw this.
[28:30.230 --> 28:32.190]  And so I did the only thing I could do.
[28:32.190 --> 28:36.550]  I put on my shoes and I got in my car and I drove the hour there and I fixed the pump.
[28:36.550 --> 28:40.670]  Honestly, it took me maybe five minutes to fix that pump.
[28:40.670 --> 28:42.830]  Then I got back in the car and my car had broken down.
[28:42.830 --> 28:43.830]  It wouldn't start.
[28:43.830 --> 28:45.670]  So I had to get my car fucking towed home that night.
[28:45.670 --> 28:48.390]  That was really funny because it was five in the morning by the time I got home.
[28:48.390 --> 28:50.950]  But I have cameras.
[28:50.950 --> 28:53.270]  I can check and see if anything goes really wrong.
[28:53.270 --> 28:57.950]  And at this point, I've been there long enough to where I know, like I said earlier, I know
[28:57.950 --> 28:59.470]  every timer in that building.
[28:59.470 --> 29:02.190]  I know every breaker in the breaker box.
[29:02.190 --> 29:06.990]  I know where I know every if I'm if a leaf moves in that room, I know which plant it
[29:06.990 --> 29:07.990]  was on.
[29:07.990 --> 29:09.270]  That's how well I know that grow.
[29:09.270 --> 29:11.330]  So it doesn't stress me out too much.
[29:11.330 --> 29:12.910]  It doesn't keep me up at night.
[29:12.990 --> 29:17.270]  Man, if you smoked as much hash as I did and smoked as many edibles as I did, you'd have
[29:17.270 --> 29:19.910]  no problem sleeping at night.
[29:19.910 --> 29:21.910]  But I just have faith in myself.
[29:21.910 --> 29:24.150]  Honestly, I've been doing this for a long time.
[29:24.150 --> 29:25.390]  I'm a confident dude.
[29:25.390 --> 29:26.390]  I take a lot of notes.
[29:26.390 --> 29:28.310]  Honestly, I write notes on everything.
[29:28.310 --> 29:31.150]  I've got billions of little post-it notes all over the grow.
[29:31.150 --> 29:32.150]  That helps me out.
[29:32.150 --> 29:36.230]  That honestly helps me keep my cool because just all the shit that I need to do is right
[29:36.230 --> 29:37.230]  there.
[29:37.230 --> 29:40.190]  And once I figure finish a couple of tasks, I cross them off the list and throw the post-it
[29:40.190 --> 29:41.190]  note away.
[29:41.190 --> 29:44.070]  And then if you give me something that I need to remember, I just write it down and I just
[29:44.070 --> 29:45.070]  keep posting notes.
[29:45.070 --> 29:46.310]  That really helps me.
[29:46.310 --> 29:48.390]  That's something that really helps me keep my shit together is notes.
[29:48.390 --> 29:49.790]  And then I talk notes into my phone.
[29:49.790 --> 29:53.550]  Also, I tell Siri, Hey Siri, make a note of this and Siri will remind me later.
[29:53.550 --> 29:56.270]  So that helps me out.
[29:56.270 --> 30:00.830]  Any tips on not on how to relax and not freak out like you tend to just chill out, bro.
[30:00.830 --> 30:01.830]  You got it.
[30:01.830 --> 30:03.310]  What are you so fucking worried about?
[30:03.310 --> 30:04.310]  Chill out.
[30:04.310 --> 30:05.310]  You're cool.
[30:05.310 --> 30:06.310]  All of you.
[30:06.310 --> 30:07.310]  Chill out.
[30:07.310 --> 30:08.310]  You got it.
[30:08.310 --> 30:09.310]  Whatever you're doing, be confident.
[30:09.310 --> 30:10.310]  You're doing it.
[30:10.910 --> 30:12.030]  But that's life.
[30:12.030 --> 30:14.910]  And when you do fix it, you'll be okay.
[30:14.910 --> 30:18.730]  Like seriously, I run a big ass grow and I was talking to a guy.
[30:18.730 --> 30:21.350]  We're opening a new facility and I was talking to a guy and he's like, So what's the first
[30:21.350 --> 30:22.350]  thing you do when you get here?
[30:22.350 --> 30:25.250]  I said, Honestly, the first thing you do every morning when you walk into a big facility
[30:25.250 --> 30:30.990]  is find the surprise because I'm going to say twice a week I walk into the grow and
[30:30.990 --> 30:33.350]  there's a surprise.
[30:33.350 --> 30:37.510]  The other day, a breaker had flipped and a cloner filled with clones that I really wanted
[30:37.510 --> 30:39.990]  to have the breaker flipped in that corner.
[30:39.990 --> 30:43.670]  All those clones died because the breaker went out.
[30:43.670 --> 30:47.310]  And today, the building next door to mine,
[30:47.310 --> 30:49.630]  all of their power went out because of a breaker.
[30:49.630 --> 30:50.630]  It had nothing to do with me,
[30:50.630 --> 30:52.390]  but I mean, there's always weird shit like that
[30:52.390 --> 30:54.250]  going on in a commercial grow.
[30:54.250 --> 30:55.890]  There's always gonna be surprises.
[30:55.890 --> 30:57.110]  So no matter how hard you do it,
[30:57.110 --> 30:58.750]  you're gonna get some kind of surprise,
[30:58.750 --> 30:59.790]  and it's how you deal with that.
[30:59.790 --> 31:01.270]  So just be ready to deal with some shit,
[31:01.270 --> 31:03.590]  don't freak out, and have faith in yourself.
[31:03.590 --> 31:05.190]  Just know that you can do it.
[31:05.190 --> 31:08.550]  You got this far, and you're gonna fuck up.
[31:08.550 --> 31:10.350]  Like, don't worry, you're gonna fuck up.
[31:10.350 --> 31:11.190]  No matter how old you are,
[31:11.190 --> 31:12.830]  no matter how much you've done it,
[31:12.830 --> 31:14.430]  you're gonna make some mistakes.
[31:14.430 --> 31:15.390]  No one's gonna laugh at you.
[31:15.390 --> 31:17.510]  Maybe we are, but laugh at yourself too.
[31:17.510 --> 31:19.830]  And if you overflow a reservoir,
[31:21.110 --> 31:23.670]  get the squeegee and push that water down to the drain,
[31:23.670 --> 31:25.030]  and then mop up the floor.
[31:25.030 --> 31:27.710]  And then next time, don't overflow that reservoir.
[31:27.710 --> 31:29.230]  If you kill a plant, remember what you did.
[31:29.230 --> 31:30.550]  Don't kill a plant again.
[31:30.550 --> 31:31.390]  I don't know.
[31:31.390 --> 31:33.870]  That's how I stay, that's how I don't freak out about stuff.
[31:33.870 --> 31:34.990]  I've been at this a long time,
[31:34.990 --> 31:37.110]  and I've dealt with a lot of mistakes and a lot of problems,
[31:37.110 --> 31:39.390]  and I know that I'm prepared to deal with almost anything
[31:39.390 --> 31:41.310]  you can throw at me in a grow room.
[31:41.310 --> 31:44.310]  And if I haven't dealt with it yet, I'm ready to learn.
[31:44.310 --> 31:46.510]  So that's how I don't freak out, bro.
[31:46.510 --> 31:49.270]  I just stay confident and know that I got this shit.
[31:49.270 --> 31:51.270]  That's life, just how it goes.
[31:51.270 --> 31:53.750]  Plants are gonna die, reservoirs are gonna overflow,
[31:53.750 --> 31:54.950]  things are gonna happen.
[31:55.830 --> 31:56.710]  Lights are gonna fall.
[31:56.710 --> 31:58.470]  I've seen lights just completely fall.
[31:58.470 --> 31:59.950]  I've seen tables fall over.
[31:59.950 --> 32:00.990]  Random shit happens.
[32:00.990 --> 32:03.830]  I'm just confident that I can deal with it when it does.
[32:03.830 --> 32:05.350]  Part of that is because I have,
[32:05.430 --> 32:08.190]  I got a little bit of faith in me and some other things,
[32:08.190 --> 32:09.390]  so it makes me confident.
[32:09.390 --> 32:10.670]  All right, so I wanna give a huge shout out
[32:10.670 --> 32:11.590]  to my buddy, Rasta Seb.
[32:11.590 --> 32:13.590]  Seb, thank you for five,
[32:13.590 --> 32:15.590]  what'd you send me, five good questions.
[32:15.590 --> 32:17.150]  There were more questions in that message,
[32:17.150 --> 32:20.070]  but I've been going for 33 minutes now,
[32:20.070 --> 32:21.790]  and I feel like most people only stick around
[32:21.790 --> 32:24.110]  for 36 minutes is what the statistics show
[32:24.110 --> 32:27.230]  when I look at my stats for my podcast.
[32:27.230 --> 32:28.990]  It looks like he has like a 36 minute episode.
[32:28.990 --> 32:30.350]  So we're getting close to that,
[32:30.350 --> 32:32.830]  which means I should start wrapping this shit up.
[32:32.870 --> 32:35.590]  So thanks to everybody who listened for this far.
[32:35.590 --> 32:37.710]  I do have more emails with more questions.
[32:37.710 --> 32:38.790]  I am getting to those.
[32:38.790 --> 32:41.270]  If you sent me a message, if you sent me an email,
[32:41.270 --> 32:43.250]  I will answer your questions, you guys.
[32:43.250 --> 32:45.910]  I get emails and messages on a lot of different platforms,
[32:45.910 --> 32:47.450]  so it's hard to find all of them.
[32:47.450 --> 32:48.710]  It would be really cool of you
[32:48.710 --> 32:51.130]  if you could send your questions and comments to me
[32:51.130 --> 32:51.970]  through the email.
[32:51.970 --> 32:54.430]  It's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[32:54.430 --> 32:55.350]  I will check that,
[32:55.350 --> 32:57.550]  and then all the podcast stuff will be right there.
[32:57.550 --> 32:58.670]  I could just look at it and be like,
[32:58.670 --> 32:59.950]  oh look, there's Bill's email,
[32:59.950 --> 33:00.790]  and then I could just read it,
[33:00.790 --> 33:02.230]  and it'll be so much easier.
[33:02.230 --> 33:03.910]  It's cool if you wanna send them on Facebook and all that,
[33:03.910 --> 33:05.910]  but sometimes I lose them and I forget where they are,
[33:05.910 --> 33:07.250]  and then I gotta go searching.
[33:07.250 --> 33:08.990]  So I try to take screenshots, honestly,
[33:08.990 --> 33:10.630]  when I have your email and I wanna use it,
[33:10.630 --> 33:12.510]  I screenshot it, so I got a picture of it.
[33:12.510 --> 33:15.310]  But anyway, send me questions via email.
[33:15.310 --> 33:16.310]  That would be really rad.
[33:16.310 --> 33:17.950]  growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[33:17.950 --> 33:20.550]  Once again, shout out to our friends at Elevate Glass,
[33:20.550 --> 33:22.190]  517 South Tejon.
[33:22.190 --> 33:24.590]  I may have said the wrong address in a previous episode.
[33:24.590 --> 33:26.910]  Elevate, I'm sorry, smoke a lot of dabs,
[33:26.910 --> 33:28.350]  and you gave me a cool rig.
[33:28.350 --> 33:30.750]  I wanna give a huge shout out to my friend Chris,
[33:30.750 --> 33:33.270]  also known as Bobo Blaster Co.
[33:33.270 --> 33:35.630]  He needs a hug, so I'm gonna send it to him.
[33:35.630 --> 33:36.870]  Big virtual hug to you, brother.
[33:36.870 --> 33:39.030]  Can't wait till you get back from your little trip.
[33:39.030 --> 33:40.470]  Hope things are well for you.
[33:41.310 --> 33:43.190]  Also, earlier I was talking about the secret sesh.
[33:43.190 --> 33:44.630]  Shout out to Lindsey for hanging out with me.
[33:44.630 --> 33:46.070]  Shout out to Molly for hanging out with me
[33:46.070 --> 33:47.030]  and keeping me alive,
[33:47.030 --> 33:48.790]  because I may have taken a nap in that damn chair
[33:48.790 --> 33:50.710]  if you ladies did not rescue me.
[33:50.710 --> 33:52.590]  All right, you guys, this is the end of the podcast.
[33:52.590 --> 33:54.070]  I wanna thank everybody for listening.
[33:54.070 --> 33:55.510]  It'd be really cool if you went to iTunes
[33:55.510 --> 33:56.510]  and do what those other folks did
[33:56.510 --> 33:57.750]  at the beginning of the show.
[33:57.750 --> 34:00.430]  Go to iTunes, find the iTunes store,
[34:01.110 --> 34:03.110]  go to the review section, yeah, that's what you do.
[34:03.110 --> 34:04.770]  Type in a Find the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[34:04.770 --> 34:07.110]  find the review section, type in a little comment,
[34:07.110 --> 34:08.550]  let me know what you think about the podcast.
[34:08.550 --> 34:11.470]  Type in some stars, just click on some stars.
[34:11.470 --> 34:13.190]  I would say give me five, but that's kinda begging.
[34:13.190 --> 34:15.650]  If you think I only deserve three, throw me three stars.
[34:15.650 --> 34:17.390]  That's fair, I wanna know what you think.
[34:17.390 --> 34:18.590]  Tell the truth.
[34:18.590 --> 34:21.790]  So, go there, leave a comment, throw me some stars.
[34:21.790 --> 34:23.270]  That'd be cool, but what would be even cooler
[34:23.270 --> 34:25.270]  is if you told like three or five of your friends
[34:25.270 --> 34:26.310]  about the podcast, you're like,
[34:26.310 --> 34:28.010]  dude, you should hear this guy's podcast.
[34:28.010 --> 34:29.470]  It's called Grow From Your Heart.
[34:29.470 --> 34:30.870]  You can listen to it on Stitcher,
[34:30.870 --> 34:32.910]  you can listen to it on iTunes,
[34:32.910 --> 34:35.250]  or you can even hear it on Tok Radio,
[34:35.250 --> 34:37.670]  tokradio.com on Wednesdays at 1 p.m.,
[34:37.670 --> 34:39.110]  or you could even go to his website,
[34:39.110 --> 34:42.470]  it's iregeneticscolorado.com and go to the podcast tab
[34:42.470 --> 34:44.710]  and you could listen to all the episodes there.
[34:44.710 --> 34:46.150]  So, tell your friends about that shit, right?
[34:46.150 --> 34:48.350]  And if you tell like three to five people,
[34:48.350 --> 34:49.990]  maybe one or two of them will start listening.
