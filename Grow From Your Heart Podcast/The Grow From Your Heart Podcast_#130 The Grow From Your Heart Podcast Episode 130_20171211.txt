[00:10.810 --> 00:43.760]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeGeffo and I thank you once again for joining me.
[00:43.760 --> 00:46.880]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.880 --> 00:49.640]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:49.640 --> 00:53.200]  Big shout out to Kat, Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:53.200 --> 00:56.640]  I hope everybody had a safe 420.
[00:56.640 --> 00:58.440]  I hope everybody got super red eyed.
[00:58.440 --> 01:00.240]  I was checking out my stash.
[01:00.240 --> 01:06.600]  I think I smoked about 14 grams of hash and ate about 2500 milligrams of edibles over
[01:06.600 --> 01:09.760]  the 420 celebration.
[01:09.760 --> 01:11.260]  My eyes were a little bit red.
[01:11.260 --> 01:15.340]  I ate 1000 milligrams on 420 and I woke up on 421 having to peel my eyes open.
[01:15.340 --> 01:16.340]  I was a little crispy.
[01:16.340 --> 01:18.940]  I hope you guys got super high.
[01:18.940 --> 01:19.940]  This is a great episode.
[01:19.940 --> 01:24.180]  I am joined by my good buddy Kabuki J Fox and we talk a little bit about CBD.
[01:24.180 --> 01:27.620]  Also White Mike was on the show, but he had to run halfway through the show.
[01:27.620 --> 01:28.620]  This is a really long podcast.
[01:28.620 --> 01:32.100]  I'm not going to ramble on too long, so I'm going to let the music play for a second and
[01:32.100 --> 01:33.100]  we get back.
[01:33.100 --> 01:36.740]  We will be joined by White Mike and Kabuki J Fox.
[01:36.740 --> 01:38.100]  So take a fat dab, sit tight.
[01:38.100 --> 01:44.510]  We'll be right back.
[01:44.670 --> 01:45.670]  I'm fucking terrible at rolling.
[01:45.670 --> 01:47.550]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back.
[01:47.550 --> 01:49.270]  I'm sitting at the table with our good buddy White Mike.
[01:49.270 --> 01:50.270]  How you doing, bro?
[01:50.270 --> 01:51.270]  Doing well, man.
[01:51.270 --> 01:52.270]  How are you?
[01:52.270 --> 01:53.270]  I am great.
[01:53.270 --> 01:54.270]  Also sitting across from me.
[01:54.270 --> 01:55.270]  Welcome to my house, bro.
[01:55.270 --> 01:59.390]  Sitting across from me at the table is Kabuki J Fox from RunCBD slash Foxtracks.
[01:59.390 --> 02:01.150]  Welcome to the humble abode, bro.
[02:01.150 --> 02:02.150]  Thank you.
[02:02.150 --> 02:03.150]  Nice to finally be here, neighbor.
[02:03.150 --> 02:04.190]  It's great to have you here, man.
[02:04.190 --> 02:05.190]  Welcome to Pueblo.
[02:05.190 --> 02:06.190]  You live in Pueblo now.
[02:06.190 --> 02:07.190]  How does that feel?
[02:07.190 --> 02:08.190]  I do.
[02:08.190 --> 02:09.190]  I love it here, man.
[02:09.190 --> 02:10.190]  Great place.
[02:10.190 --> 02:11.190]  Welcome.
[02:11.190 --> 02:12.190]  It's good to have you here.
[02:12.190 --> 02:13.190]  It's great to have both you guys here on the podcast at the same time.
[02:13.870 --> 02:14.870]  Yeah.
[02:14.870 --> 02:15.870]  Nice to meet you, White Mike.
[02:15.870 --> 02:16.870]  Yeah.
[02:16.870 --> 02:17.870]  Thanks, man.
[02:17.870 --> 02:18.870]  He calls you White Mike.
[02:18.870 --> 02:19.870]  I fucking love it.
[02:19.870 --> 02:20.870]  He's never going to be White Mike for everyone.
[02:20.870 --> 02:24.590]  I could tell who knows me strictly from the podcast because that's where that name exists
[02:24.590 --> 02:25.590]  for the most part.
[02:25.590 --> 02:26.590]  Yeah.
[02:26.590 --> 02:27.590]  He just came out as White Mike on the show one year.
[02:27.590 --> 02:28.590]  Oh, really?
[02:28.590 --> 02:29.590]  Yeah.
[02:29.590 --> 02:30.590]  That's my buddy White Mike.
[02:30.590 --> 02:31.590]  White Mike for life for you, bro.
[02:31.590 --> 02:32.590]  White Mike for...
[02:32.590 --> 02:33.590]  Hashtag White Mike for life.
[02:33.590 --> 02:34.590]  I'm getting some echo.
[02:34.590 --> 02:35.590]  What's that echo from?
[02:35.590 --> 02:36.590]  All right.
[02:36.590 --> 02:37.590]  I got it under control.
[02:37.590 --> 02:38.590]  Sorry.
[02:38.590 --> 02:39.590]  You guys are not sound guys.
[02:39.590 --> 02:40.590]  I don't know why I asked anybody else what the echo was from.
[02:40.590 --> 02:41.590]  Jeff is an amazing sound guy.
[02:41.590 --> 02:42.590]  Bum, bum, bum.
[02:42.590 --> 02:43.590]  I'm cool.
[02:43.590 --> 02:44.590]  I'm cool.
[02:44.590 --> 02:45.590]  I'm cool.
[02:45.590 --> 02:46.590]  I'm cool.
[02:46.590 --> 02:47.590]  I'm cool.
[02:47.590 --> 02:48.590]  I hope you get well, bro.
[02:48.590 --> 02:49.590]  But you didn't know that because Jeff...
[02:49.590 --> 02:50.590]  Fancy didn't say you didn't hear.
[02:50.590 --> 02:51.870]  Kabuki's over here rolling a blunt and Mike was quite impressed by your rolling skills.
[02:51.870 --> 02:52.870]  Yeah.
[02:52.870 --> 02:53.870]  Way better than mine.
[02:53.870 --> 02:55.110]  I got a bunch of dry shift frozen on my fingers.
[02:55.110 --> 02:57.290]  I'm tearing the leaves apart.
[02:57.290 --> 02:59.410]  Usually I'll do a better job.
[02:59.410 --> 03:00.410]  All right.
[03:00.410 --> 03:01.410]  Welcome to the show, you guys.
[03:01.410 --> 03:02.470]  This is the episode after 420.
[03:02.470 --> 03:04.370]  We're going to do a little bit of a 420 recap.
[03:04.370 --> 03:08.110]  We'll talk about where everybody was, what they all did on 420 and we're going to talk
[03:08.110 --> 03:10.370]  about some bullshit that happened on 420.
[03:10.370 --> 03:12.130]  Yeah, there's a lot of that.
[03:12.130 --> 03:14.910]  Yeah, Mike, what'd you do on 420, my friend?
[03:14.910 --> 03:16.570]  I had a really low key 420.
[03:16.570 --> 03:19.610]  I had the day off, but I also don't have childcare that day,
[03:19.610 --> 03:22.770]  so I hung out with the kid until about six.
[03:22.770 --> 03:24.730]  I ran around town and picked up a whole bunch
[03:24.730 --> 03:26.610]  of marijuana products that don't get you high
[03:26.610 --> 03:28.850]  and ran those up to a friend in Denver.
[03:28.850 --> 03:29.930]  A shout out to your friend in Denver.
[03:29.930 --> 03:32.370]  I hope we are able to take good care of him.
[03:32.370 --> 03:33.210]  Working on it.
[03:33.210 --> 03:35.970]  Yes, shout out to CBD, hashtag fuck cancer.
[03:35.970 --> 03:36.930]  Always.
[03:36.930 --> 03:40.370]  So your CBD, your 420 was spent.
[03:40.370 --> 03:41.730]  You guys, you may have to excuse us.
[03:41.730 --> 03:44.090]  There will be some stutters and some stumbles
[03:44.090 --> 03:47.690]  and some randomness in this podcast, I promise you.
[03:47.690 --> 03:49.530]  Many giant dabs have been taken.
[03:49.530 --> 03:50.850]  Many giant dabs have happened.
[03:50.850 --> 03:51.690]  There are two emails.
[03:51.690 --> 03:53.170]  A relatively small amount of time.
[03:53.170 --> 03:54.930]  Yes, a short amount of time, lots of dabs.
[03:54.930 --> 03:56.190]  There are two emails on the table.
[03:56.190 --> 03:58.250]  We've got a beautiful rig from our friends
[03:58.250 --> 03:59.610]  at Bear Mountain Studios.
[03:59.610 --> 04:00.810]  Shout out to Evan and Cas.
[04:00.810 --> 04:02.210]  Shout out to those kids.
[04:02.210 --> 04:03.770]  Great kids, I met them at the Cannabis Cup
[04:03.770 --> 04:06.570]  a couple years ago, great kids.
[04:07.210 --> 04:08.370]  So Mike hung out with the kid on 420.
[04:08.370 --> 04:09.690]  I was gonna ask Kabuki what he did,
[04:09.690 --> 04:12.610]  but he is taking a glob over here of some rosin.
[04:12.610 --> 04:14.050]  So we're gonna have to give him a minute.
[04:14.050 --> 04:16.770]  That was like a week's worth of Mike dabs right there.
[04:16.770 --> 04:18.090]  That was a fat, there we go.
[04:18.090 --> 04:19.690]  We're gonna change that tonight.
[04:19.690 --> 04:20.770]  There we go.
[04:22.770 --> 04:23.850]  We're gonna clear this head and hold up
[04:23.850 --> 04:26.330]  and give a variety of dabs.
[04:26.330 --> 04:28.450]  We've seen what happens when we give Mike too big of a dab.
[04:28.450 --> 04:29.490]  He turns different colors,
[04:29.490 --> 04:31.530]  has to run to the bathroom and hide for a minute.
[04:31.530 --> 04:32.570]  Yeah, it's nice in there.
[04:32.570 --> 04:33.410]  Feel free.
[04:33.410 --> 04:34.230]  I'm a grabber.
[04:34.230 --> 04:35.070]  Thank you, bro.
[04:35.070 --> 04:37.030]  Frank Kabuki, what'd you do on 420, bro?
[04:37.030 --> 04:40.630]  My 420 was pretty low key-ish.
[04:40.630 --> 04:44.670]  My girl's mom was in town, so we just kinda kicked it.
[04:45.990 --> 04:47.510]  Is your girl's mom a smoker?
[04:47.510 --> 04:49.310]  Yeah, she's totally pro cannabis.
[04:49.310 --> 04:50.150]  Okay, cool, just curious.
[04:50.150 --> 04:51.710]  Yeah, she's super awesome.
[04:51.710 --> 04:52.550]  Awesome.
[04:52.550 --> 04:53.390]  Shout out to moms.
[04:53.390 --> 04:54.510]  Shout out to moms that smoke.
[04:54.510 --> 04:55.350]  Yeah, definitely.
[04:55.350 --> 04:56.750]  Shout out to moms that support cannabis,
[04:56.750 --> 04:57.990]  even if they don't do.
[04:58.950 --> 05:02.790]  Yeah, and then I sponsored the 5280 Glass Showcase,
[05:02.790 --> 05:04.210]  which was really cool.
[05:04.210 --> 05:06.290]  From what I heard, it went on pretty long,
[05:06.290 --> 05:09.490]  from like four to midnight,
[05:09.490 --> 05:11.170]  and I caught it towards the end of it.
[05:11.170 --> 05:12.450]  I showed up at eight.
[05:12.450 --> 05:14.010]  Where was that happening?
[05:14.010 --> 05:16.690]  At Native Hotel in downtown Denver.
[05:16.690 --> 05:17.890]  N-A-T-I-V.
[05:17.890 --> 05:20.170]  Yes, and it was cool how they handled that,
[05:20.170 --> 05:22.690]  because they had two buses outside
[05:22.690 --> 05:25.750]  where any dabbing or smoking or any consumption was done.
[05:25.750 --> 05:30.130]  So, though obviously we couldn't do anything in the hotel,
[05:30.130 --> 05:32.130]  they had made space and a counter for people
[05:32.130 --> 05:33.330]  that were getting medicated,
[05:33.370 --> 05:35.370]  and they weren't fucked with at all all night,
[05:35.370 --> 05:36.210]  which is really cool.
[05:36.210 --> 05:37.650]  I wanna give a shout out to Adam Dunn and his crew.
[05:37.650 --> 05:39.570]  They were the first people I ever saw
[05:39.570 --> 05:42.370]  use rented buses to park.
[05:42.370 --> 05:43.830]  They had tour buses for bands,
[05:43.830 --> 05:45.130]  and we parked them outside of the Fox
[05:45.130 --> 05:46.690]  or the Oriental Theater one night,
[05:46.690 --> 05:48.090]  and they're like, you can't medicate in here,
[05:48.090 --> 05:50.430]  but this is a VIP bus, wink, wink,
[05:50.430 --> 05:51.270]  and we were able to dab in there,
[05:51.270 --> 05:52.570]  because it's private property.
[05:52.570 --> 05:53.410]  Exactly.
[05:53.410 --> 05:54.370]  So, that's pretty rad.
[05:54.370 --> 05:55.330]  That's how that worked out,
[05:55.330 --> 05:56.530]  and yeah, it was a cool event.
[05:56.530 --> 05:58.690]  Just approaching a local glass artist.
[05:58.690 --> 06:01.810]  A lot of people showed up, a lot of friendly faces.
[06:01.810 --> 06:02.650]  It was super fun.
[06:02.970 --> 06:06.530]  After that, I went to see some good friends of mine downtown.
[06:06.530 --> 06:10.210]  One ate some pizza, some mac and cheese pizza from,
[06:10.210 --> 06:11.610]  fuck, I can't remember the name of this place.
[06:11.610 --> 06:12.850]  Oh, Mac and Cheese Pizza.
[06:12.850 --> 06:14.050]  Oh, it was awesome.
[06:14.050 --> 06:14.890]  That sounds familiar.
[06:14.890 --> 06:15.730]  Fucking like, you know,
[06:15.730 --> 06:17.970]  because it's white cheese sauce from the Mac,
[06:17.970 --> 06:20.250]  and New York style bread on the,
[06:20.250 --> 06:22.810]  oh, it was awesome.
[06:22.810 --> 06:24.650]  Why did you do that at the start of the show?
[06:24.650 --> 06:26.690]  Dude, I wonder how much pizza was sold on 420.
[06:26.690 --> 06:28.050]  Oh, I want that so bad right now.
[06:28.050 --> 06:29.170]  Oh, shit, I don't know.
[06:29.170 --> 06:30.410]  I mean, I don't know.
[06:30.690 --> 06:32.970]  I want to say a million dollars worth of pizza,
[06:32.970 --> 06:34.010]  at least, easy.
[06:34.010 --> 06:36.370]  I don't know how much pizza is sold in Denver
[06:36.370 --> 06:38.290]  on a daily basis, but.
[06:38.290 --> 06:41.130]  I actually know a guy that works at a pizza place
[06:41.130 --> 06:43.370]  who said that the owner of his pizza place
[06:43.370 --> 06:45.170]  almost had to close the business
[06:45.170 --> 06:47.290]  because they weren't surviving here in Pueblo.
[06:47.290 --> 06:48.130]  What?
[06:48.130 --> 06:49.450]  And then cannabis was legalized,
[06:49.450 --> 06:51.050]  and now their business is thriving,
[06:51.050 --> 06:52.610]  and they're opening more locations.
[06:52.610 --> 06:54.650]  So, shout out to cannabis and pizza.
[06:54.650 --> 06:57.330]  Shout out to Pueblo for smoking more weed.
[06:57.330 --> 06:58.650]  Yeah, more weed than,
[06:58.690 --> 07:00.690]  so, you've been all over the place, Fox.
[07:00.690 --> 07:02.650]  We do have stuff to talk about on this podcast,
[07:02.650 --> 07:03.970]  but we're gonna get ADD today,
[07:03.970 --> 07:04.810]  and it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[07:04.810 --> 07:06.050]  I think a lot of good shit comes out
[07:06.050 --> 07:07.290]  in these random conversations.
[07:07.290 --> 07:08.130]  Oh, always.
[07:08.130 --> 07:09.290]  You've been all over the place.
[07:09.290 --> 07:11.250]  Where do you find smokes the most herb?
[07:12.610 --> 07:14.610]  Are we talking Colorado only, or are we talking in general?
[07:14.610 --> 07:15.970]  Anywhere you've been, yeah.
[07:17.250 --> 07:19.090]  Okay, so I'll say this.
[07:19.090 --> 07:20.570]  California is interesting,
[07:20.570 --> 07:22.970]  because I was in the Bay and Northern Cali,
[07:22.970 --> 07:25.050]  and it's very cannabis-friendly up there.
[07:25.050 --> 07:27.690]  As far as the cities go, lifestyle, culture,
[07:27.730 --> 07:29.250]  it's very cannabis-integrated.
[07:31.530 --> 07:34.850]  But as of lately, Colorado, within the last year,
[07:34.850 --> 07:36.890]  I feel, has really stepped their shit up.
[07:39.490 --> 07:42.690]  So, yeah, and I wanna say,
[07:45.410 --> 07:47.650]  there's so many fucking people
[07:47.650 --> 07:49.610]  that blow it down heavy down here.
[07:49.610 --> 07:51.850]  Yeah, between Denver and Pueblo,
[07:51.850 --> 07:53.330]  there's a lot of heavy heads.
[07:53.330 --> 07:55.010]  And let me reiterate that.
[07:55.010 --> 07:57.530]  From the mountains up north to Pueblo,
[07:58.370 --> 07:59.250]  there's a lot of really heavy heads.
[07:59.250 --> 08:01.170]  So I still think that people in Colorado
[08:01.170 --> 08:02.850]  really throw it down.
[08:02.850 --> 08:06.090]  And it's time for the city and our culture
[08:06.090 --> 08:07.530]  to catch up with it.
[08:07.530 --> 08:08.450]  Right, yeah.
[08:08.450 --> 08:09.570]  So shout out to Colorado.
[08:09.570 --> 08:11.490]  Apparently, we smoke a lot of herb.
[08:11.490 --> 08:12.730]  Yeah, you guys do.
[08:12.730 --> 08:16.130]  I mean, hey, from Miami to California to New York
[08:16.130 --> 08:17.370]  to Oregon to Washington,
[08:17.370 --> 08:20.050]  I mean, all these places are different and stuff,
[08:20.050 --> 08:23.370]  but Colorado is still the bedrock.
[08:23.370 --> 08:24.810]  People always look to us,
[08:24.810 --> 08:26.890]  regardless of whether we wanna admit it or not.
[08:27.690 --> 08:30.890]  You can accept that it's not about wearing a badge
[08:30.890 --> 08:33.170]  or anything, but it's the truth.
[08:33.170 --> 08:35.410]  So embrace it, smoke it up.
[08:35.410 --> 08:36.370]  There you go.
[08:36.370 --> 08:38.570]  All right, so did you have a good 420, bro?
[08:38.570 --> 08:40.250]  Yes, it was super nice,
[08:40.250 --> 08:43.610]  minus the drive from Pueblo to Denver to Pueblo
[08:43.610 --> 08:44.450]  on the same night.
[08:45.530 --> 08:47.570]  I did the same thing on 420.
[08:47.570 --> 08:49.050]  It wasn't a bad drive that night,
[08:49.050 --> 08:50.890]  but there was a lot of enforcement.
[08:50.890 --> 08:53.650]  Absolutely, which luckily I didn't hear
[08:53.650 --> 08:55.890]  about any of our friends or anyone
[08:55.930 --> 08:58.090]  in close relation of our circles being fucked with
[08:58.090 --> 08:59.530]  in that sense, but-
[08:59.530 --> 09:01.210]  I know a couple of folks that got pulled over,
[09:01.210 --> 09:05.210]  but they didn't get cited for anything.
[09:05.210 --> 09:07.210]  They just got pulled over in some other way.
[09:07.210 --> 09:08.570]  Yeah, well, that's nice.
[09:09.930 --> 09:11.450]  At least no one got fucked with.
[09:11.450 --> 09:13.730]  Right, sorry, I was taking a hit off this blunt.
[09:13.730 --> 09:15.170]  Sorry. No, it looks delicious
[09:15.170 --> 09:17.210]  and I'd love to hit it, but not with the cold, you guys.
[09:17.210 --> 09:19.210]  What was the, what was your favorite piece of glass
[09:19.210 --> 09:20.570]  you saw at this glass showcase, bro?
[09:20.570 --> 09:25.010]  Ooh, okay, so, shit, put me on the spot.
[09:25.010 --> 09:28.970]  So, Calm, at Combo on Instagram,
[09:29.850 --> 09:34.290]  Calvin does the birds and stuff like that.
[09:34.290 --> 09:36.610]  That's one of Weezy's favorite glass artists also.
[09:36.610 --> 09:39.530]  He's my favorite sculpture artist, always has been.
[09:39.530 --> 09:41.530]  I love his birds, they're fucking awesome.
[09:41.530 --> 09:44.530]  But him and Alex Tuba, who does those Warlock Pendi's,
[09:44.530 --> 09:47.410]  they just went to Japan, and the fucking collabs
[09:47.410 --> 09:49.770]  that they did with Team Japan, the Aquarius,
[09:49.770 --> 09:51.650]  the dudes that do all the dot work and all that
[09:51.650 --> 09:53.690]  are just, blew my mind.
[09:53.690 --> 09:57.450]  Like, literally, there was one bird
[09:57.450 --> 10:00.150]  with a Mandela dot work on the stomach,
[10:00.150 --> 10:03.570]  and it was just like, the detail is insane.
[10:03.570 --> 10:05.370]  You could've gotten lost in it.
[10:05.370 --> 10:08.130]  It's one of those pieces that I probably wouldn't even use.
[10:08.130 --> 10:09.690]  I mean, I would, but you know.
[10:09.690 --> 10:11.330]  Do you know what the price tag was on that piece?
[10:11.330 --> 10:12.610]  15K on it.
[10:12.610 --> 10:14.410]  Yeah, it was definitely, yeah, I mean,
[10:14.410 --> 10:17.690]  you talk Team Japan and anything Calm,
[10:17.690 --> 10:21.650]  you know, it's gonna be pricey, but holy shit.
[10:21.650 --> 10:23.290]  Yeah, beautiful artwork.
[10:23.890 --> 10:26.530]  And there was a lot of other great artists there, too.
[10:27.530 --> 10:29.050]  Oh, shit.
[10:29.050 --> 10:32.530]  John Taylor made this with, shit.
[10:34.930 --> 10:36.090]  That guy's coming up quick.
[10:36.090 --> 10:38.370]  Yeah, he made the AK replica.
[10:38.370 --> 10:39.210]  Oh, okay, wow.
[10:39.210 --> 10:42.490]  So yeah, like, very, I know he's kind of a,
[10:42.490 --> 10:44.890]  he's very adamant about gun stuff and stuff,
[10:44.890 --> 10:46.490]  and you can see it in his glass work,
[10:46.490 --> 10:49.330]  because the detail to the piece is incredible.
[10:49.330 --> 10:50.170]  Nice.
[10:51.170 --> 10:54.530]  Pogo Glass, who, he's a great friend, too,
[10:54.530 --> 10:56.090]  and that guy kills it in his own regard.
[10:56.090 --> 10:58.650]  There was, yeah, Lunchbox Mechanic,
[10:58.650 --> 11:00.850]  Matt Pinner, he was there doing his thing.
[11:02.730 --> 11:03.890]  Yeah, there was a lot of shit there.
[11:03.890 --> 11:06.330]  I got there pretty late, and it was mostly
[11:06.330 --> 11:07.490]  about just seeing people, you know,
[11:07.490 --> 11:11.050]  because I hadn't gone into Denver almost, you know,
[11:11.050 --> 11:12.810]  two, three months on any event like that,
[11:12.810 --> 11:15.090]  so it was nice just catching up with all friendly faces
[11:15.090 --> 11:16.730]  from up north that came into Denver
[11:16.730 --> 11:17.570]  from the opposite direction. That's the fun part
[11:17.570 --> 11:19.490]  of these events. Oh, of course, absolutely.
[11:19.570 --> 11:21.970]  And the art was just, you know, a bonus.
[11:21.970 --> 11:23.930]  It was weird not having a cannabis cup.
[11:23.930 --> 11:25.930]  Usually the cup is where I see everybody.
[11:25.930 --> 11:28.530]  I want to say as much shit as people talk about the cup,
[11:28.530 --> 11:30.490]  or whatever they, you know, whatever gripes they have
[11:30.490 --> 11:32.330]  against, you know, the competition side of it,
[11:32.330 --> 11:35.330]  or whatever it is, you can definitely feel
[11:35.330 --> 11:38.290]  the missed presence of that event.
[11:38.290 --> 11:41.010]  Absolutely. It made, people had their opinions about it,
[11:41.010 --> 11:42.330]  and whatever you thought of it,
[11:42.330 --> 11:44.930]  it was just a great place to meet up with everybody.
[11:44.930 --> 11:47.250]  I would see everybody from Addison DeMora
[11:47.250 --> 11:50.610]  to Kabuki J. Fox, to just my random local friends there,
[11:50.610 --> 11:52.450]  and we would all get along and hang out.
[11:52.450 --> 11:55.210]  I would dab with Danny Danko, everybody.
[11:55.210 --> 11:57.250]  We'd just hang out. It would be such a good time,
[11:57.250 --> 11:59.450]  and there's nowhere else you can go and see that many people.
[11:59.450 --> 12:03.170]  No, not at the same place, and though it's cool,
[12:03.170 --> 12:05.450]  because now we, you know, I unfortunately missed
[12:05.450 --> 12:07.930]  Secret Sessions this year, so I'm glad that I've been told
[12:07.930 --> 12:09.490]  that they're going to be planning it for the next one,
[12:09.490 --> 12:13.610]  because we'll be out there hard, but a lot of, you know,
[12:13.610 --> 12:16.410]  a lot of events were planned, and I feel like
[12:16.410 --> 12:19.930]  of the fucking, of the seven,
[12:19.930 --> 12:22.530]  the five to seven events that I heard of,
[12:22.530 --> 12:25.330]  three to four of them, all but two,
[12:25.330 --> 12:27.450]  and the showcase got raided, you know?
[12:27.450 --> 12:30.850]  Yes, the cops did shut down almost all consumption events.
[12:30.850 --> 12:31.690]  Yeah.
[12:31.690 --> 12:32.530]  Because I was just laughing.
[12:32.530 --> 12:33.350]  The law enforcement was not amused.
[12:33.350 --> 12:35.570]  My laughter was because I tried to pick up a water bottle
[12:35.570 --> 12:37.770]  off of an oil slick pad, and there was so much oil
[12:37.770 --> 12:40.850]  on the oil slick pad that the water bottle just stuck to it,
[12:40.850 --> 12:42.010]  and it was pretty damn funny,
[12:42.010 --> 12:43.370]  if you heard my goofy laughter there.
[12:43.370 --> 12:44.210]  Oh, that's what that was.
[12:44.210 --> 12:45.330]  That was what that was all about.
[12:45.330 --> 12:46.450]  I thought you were doing a magic trick.
[12:46.450 --> 12:48.910]  Yeah, well, I accidentally am a magician now.
[12:48.910 --> 12:50.530]  So you mentioned Secret Sesh.
[12:50.530 --> 12:54.210]  That's obviously where I was for 421.
[12:54.210 --> 12:56.610]  I'm laughing at you guys complaining about your driving.
[12:56.610 --> 12:58.010]  I work in Colorado Springs.
[12:58.010 --> 13:01.210]  For 420, I woke up, I live in Pueblo,
[13:01.210 --> 13:02.970]  I woke up, got stoned as shit,
[13:02.970 --> 13:05.690]  drove up to Colorado Springs to work,
[13:05.690 --> 13:06.850]  worked in Colorado Springs.
[13:06.850 --> 13:09.610]  The boss called me at 220, or called me at two o'clock,
[13:09.610 --> 13:11.170]  and he said, be ready for 220 dabs.
[13:11.170 --> 13:12.370]  I'm going to pick you up.
[13:12.370 --> 13:13.450]  So we went to lunch.
[13:13.850 --> 13:15.930]  We came back.
[13:15.930 --> 13:16.970]  I went to work for a little bit.
[13:16.970 --> 13:18.770]  My alarm went off, so it hits four o'clock.
[13:18.770 --> 13:21.170]  I went and took another break, celebrated 420,
[13:21.170 --> 13:24.450]  took about a half gram dab, went back to work, came home.
[13:24.450 --> 13:26.170]  The next day I went to Secret Sesh.
[13:26.170 --> 13:29.930]  So I went Pueblo Springs, Pueblo, woke up,
[13:29.930 --> 13:33.250]  drove to Pueblo, or drove to Springs on 421,
[13:33.250 --> 13:35.650]  handled the garden, the stuff that needed to be done,
[13:35.650 --> 13:37.370]  drove to Secret Sesh in Denver,
[13:37.370 --> 13:39.810]  raged Secret Sesh from about four in the afternoon
[13:39.810 --> 13:41.010]  until about one in the morning,
[13:41.010 --> 13:42.690]  dabbing with all kinds of people.
[13:42.690 --> 13:46.090]  I smoked, I took 11 grams with me,
[13:46.090 --> 13:48.610]  and I think I smoked seven of them at the Secret Sesh.
[13:48.610 --> 13:49.690]  It's awesome.
[13:49.690 --> 13:51.850]  Plus whatever other people were dabbing me on with.
[13:51.850 --> 13:54.370]  Shout out, if you gave me a dab at Secret Sesh,
[13:54.370 --> 13:55.290]  shout out, thank you.
[13:55.290 --> 13:56.210]  It looked like a lot of fun.
[13:56.210 --> 13:57.050]  A lot of the friends were laughing.
[13:57.050 --> 13:58.050]  It was a huge good time.
[13:58.050 --> 13:58.970]  I've got a huge list of people
[13:58.970 --> 14:00.290]  I want to give shout outs to from that,
[14:00.290 --> 14:02.170]  but I wanted to talk about a couple other things first.
[14:02.170 --> 14:03.330]  I don't remember what I was saying,
[14:03.330 --> 14:07.010]  but I drove back from the Secret Sesh to work
[14:07.010 --> 14:08.130]  to check on the plants again,
[14:08.130 --> 14:09.970]  because I didn't get everything done
[14:09.970 --> 14:10.970]  in the first half of the day,
[14:10.970 --> 14:12.670]  and I knew the plants weren't ready for more water,
[14:13.650 --> 14:14.490]  so I gave him some time to chill
[14:14.490 --> 14:15.630]  and went back and took care of him again later.
[14:15.630 --> 14:18.030]  So I showed up to the garden at like three in the morning,
[14:18.030 --> 14:19.230]  took care of the plants.
[14:19.230 --> 14:21.710]  Hey, shout out to you getting your shit done,
[14:21.710 --> 14:23.790]  regardless of our holiday,
[14:23.790 --> 14:27.350]  which regardless of, it's great for the patience,
[14:27.350 --> 14:28.630]  but when you're in the industry
[14:28.630 --> 14:30.750]  or you have work to tend to,
[14:30.750 --> 14:33.070]  you have to balance the both.
[14:33.070 --> 14:33.910]  I appreciate that,
[14:33.910 --> 14:36.110]  and I'm gonna extend that shout out beyond myself
[14:36.110 --> 14:37.910]  to everybody, all the Canada Soldiers
[14:37.910 --> 14:39.230]  that have a garden that,
[14:39.230 --> 14:40.870]  when you can see who it is,
[14:40.870 --> 14:42.130]  will be having a good ass time
[14:42.610 --> 14:43.770]  and six or eight people look at their watches
[14:43.770 --> 14:44.930]  and you see them go, oh shit.
[14:44.930 --> 14:45.770]  Gotta go.
[14:45.770 --> 14:47.430]  Gotta go, gotta go do something at the garden.
[14:47.430 --> 14:49.650]  We all just take off, go to our separate grows.
[14:49.650 --> 14:51.890]  That blunt is sticky, bro, nice work.
[14:51.890 --> 14:54.250]  Thank you, yeah, there's a bunch of bras inside too.
[14:54.250 --> 14:55.090]  Yeah.
[14:55.090 --> 14:56.650]  So that's the whole reason for the sticky.
[14:56.650 --> 14:58.490]  So I, of course, went to the Secret Sesh.
[14:58.490 --> 15:00.090]  Shout out to everybody at the Secret Sesh.
[15:00.090 --> 15:01.490]  I've got a long list of people here
[15:01.490 --> 15:02.610]  that I wanna give shout outs to.
[15:02.610 --> 15:04.830]  Of course, I wanna give a huge shout out to my boy,
[15:04.830 --> 15:07.170]  John Hunt, the grimy motherfucking Gatsby.
[15:07.170 --> 15:08.770]  Hashtag, I know Hunt.
[15:08.770 --> 15:11.010]  Yeah, everybody was trying to hit me up,
[15:11.010 --> 15:12.930]  hit up Hunt, everybody was hitting up Adam Mill
[15:12.930 --> 15:13.970]  trying to get into the event.
[15:13.970 --> 15:16.050]  You guys, there's one way to get into the Secret Sesh.
[15:16.050 --> 15:17.050]  You have to go to the Instagram,
[15:17.050 --> 15:18.410]  you have to follow the rules
[15:18.410 --> 15:19.930]  and either you get in or you don't.
[15:19.930 --> 15:20.890]  Yeah, pretty simple.
[15:20.890 --> 15:23.150]  You guys are very apparent about the rules.
[15:24.210 --> 15:25.170]  I can't help you.
[15:25.170 --> 15:26.530]  They were quick to respond.
[15:26.530 --> 15:28.530]  Hunt can't help you, Adam Mill can't help you
[15:28.530 --> 15:30.210]  unless you're already in our crew
[15:30.210 --> 15:32.970]  and on the list of promoters or vendors or sponsors.
[15:32.970 --> 15:34.930]  You gotta pay and you gotta try to get in
[15:34.930 --> 15:36.770]  like everybody else.
[15:36.770 --> 15:38.890]  But no fancy treatment here.
[15:38.890 --> 15:39.730]  Yeah.
[15:39.730 --> 15:40.570]  I've been there.
[15:41.450 --> 15:43.410]  Big shout out to Adam Mill, of course,
[15:43.410 --> 15:44.250]  for hosting the event.
[15:44.250 --> 15:45.090]  Yeah, man.
[15:45.090 --> 15:46.690]  What?
[15:46.690 --> 15:48.090]  Sad that I missed him, man.
[15:48.090 --> 15:48.930]  He's a good dude.
[15:48.930 --> 15:49.770]  Yeah, he's a great guy.
[15:49.770 --> 15:51.890]  Kosher Stoner, Adam Macintoshes, that's my buddy.
[15:51.890 --> 15:54.090]  Make sure you guys follow Adam Blunts on Facebook.
[15:54.090 --> 15:54.930]  He's a cool dude.
[15:54.930 --> 15:55.750]  Really cool dude.
[15:55.750 --> 15:57.970]  Dabber, Dab Aficionado, look chic.
[15:57.970 --> 16:00.770]  Also, huge shout out to my buddy, DJ Juggie.
[16:00.770 --> 16:04.010]  Juggie is the DJ that's on some of Task Rock's material.
[16:04.010 --> 16:04.850]  Oh, cool.
[16:04.850 --> 16:07.330]  And I think I've met Juggie one other time
[16:07.330 --> 16:08.730]  but it was more crowded.
[16:08.730 --> 16:10.010]  I actually was blessed enough
[16:10.010 --> 16:11.050]  to be hanging out in the green room.
[16:11.050 --> 16:13.290]  I had a little green room pass this time.
[16:13.290 --> 16:14.250]  We were all hanging out in the green room
[16:14.250 --> 16:16.490]  and Juggie's just a cool ass, level-headed dude.
[16:16.490 --> 16:18.730]  He's mellow, he's calm, he's a fucking classy adult.
[16:18.730 --> 16:20.210]  So shout out to that dude.
[16:20.210 --> 16:21.410]  Huge shout out to Nick Mailman.
[16:21.410 --> 16:23.850]  I'd never met Nick Mailman until Secret Sash.
[16:23.850 --> 16:24.690]  Nick's the homie.
[16:24.690 --> 16:26.330]  Dude, that guy's cool as fuck.
[16:26.330 --> 16:27.490]  Why haven't I met that guy before?
[16:27.490 --> 16:28.330]  We need to be friends.
[16:28.330 --> 16:29.330]  Nick, let's dab, bro.
[16:29.330 --> 16:30.170]  Let's hang out.
[16:30.170 --> 16:31.570]  Also, too, I'm not sure if that's your girlfriend
[16:31.570 --> 16:33.570]  or your wife but his wife, she's cool too.
[16:33.570 --> 16:34.410]  Very friendly.
[16:34.410 --> 16:35.230]  Very sweet lady.
[16:35.230 --> 16:36.070]  Yeah, very nice.
[16:36.710 --> 16:38.150]  Huge shout out to my bald-headed friend,
[16:38.150 --> 16:40.310]  John Anthony Moses and his lovely wife.
[16:41.190 --> 16:43.990]  John follows the show quite religiously.
[16:45.270 --> 16:46.350]  John, you're a fanboy, bro.
[16:46.350 --> 16:47.870]  I like you being a fanboy.
[16:47.870 --> 16:48.710]  I like that.
[16:48.710 --> 16:49.530]  I just called you a fanboy.
[16:49.530 --> 16:50.370]  I appreciate it, dude.
[16:50.370 --> 16:51.210]  That is cool.
[16:51.210 --> 16:52.870]  Thanks for supporting the show, for following me,
[16:52.870 --> 16:55.110]  for all the love that you showed me at the Secret Sash.
[16:55.110 --> 16:57.110]  Also, shout out to Cooper Watts.
[16:57.110 --> 16:59.230]  I'd never met the dude in person until Secret Sash.
[16:59.230 --> 17:01.750]  He actually works at the green and healthy wellness
[17:01.750 --> 17:04.310]  that's known as Nugs in Denver.
[17:04.310 --> 17:05.150]  Cool ass dude.
[17:05.150 --> 17:06.230]  It was cool to finally meet him.
[17:06.230 --> 17:08.750]  Also, shout out to Tony from LA who works the camera.
[17:08.750 --> 17:11.230]  I feel like a dick smoking this in front of a white mic.
[17:11.230 --> 17:12.590]  He's not big on the blunts anyway
[17:12.590 --> 17:14.390]  so you're not hurting his feelings too much.
[17:14.390 --> 17:18.030]  I enjoy them but yeah, don't feel bad about leaving me out.
[17:18.030 --> 17:21.430]  I feel bad about risking getting you guys sick at all.
[17:21.430 --> 17:23.150]  I don't wanna join the blunt.
[17:23.150 --> 17:23.990]  That's just too much.
[17:23.990 --> 17:25.030]  You can have that back, my friend.
[17:25.030 --> 17:25.850]  I will.
[17:25.850 --> 17:28.710]  I'm gonna give a shout to Official Tim also.
[17:28.710 --> 17:29.550]  Did I do Official Tim?
[17:29.550 --> 17:30.390]  I might've skipped him.
[17:30.390 --> 17:32.110]  Shout out to Official Tim.
[17:32.110 --> 17:32.950]  Secret Sash Tim?
[17:32.950 --> 17:34.790]  Secret Sash Tim, yeah.
[17:34.790 --> 17:37.990]  And Jason and Jessica, my friends.
[17:37.990 --> 17:38.830]  You guys are great.
[17:38.830 --> 17:39.830]  It was good to bump into you guys.
[17:39.830 --> 17:41.710]  Bobo and Lindsey, shout out.
[17:41.710 --> 17:42.950]  I think I did Tony.
[17:42.950 --> 17:43.770]  Shout out to Tony.
[17:43.770 --> 17:44.610]  Yes, camera guy.
[17:45.430 --> 17:47.510]  Huge shout out to all of the seed companies.
[17:47.510 --> 17:48.750]  Oh my gosh.
[17:48.750 --> 17:50.290]  Is there a bunch of them?
[17:50.290 --> 17:51.870]  This is a bag of seeds that was gifted to me
[17:51.870 --> 17:54.150]  from one seed breeder.
[17:54.150 --> 17:55.930]  Yeah, one breeder gave me this bag.
[17:55.930 --> 17:57.750]  So just imagine what my backpack looks like.
[17:57.750 --> 17:58.590]  That's awesome.
[17:58.590 --> 18:00.390]  I was gifted seeds from, this is from,
[18:01.750 --> 18:02.670]  I wanna make sure I get it right.
[18:03.390 --> 18:04.230]  Concentrated Genetics.
[18:04.230 --> 18:05.230]  Cool, shout out to them,
[18:05.230 --> 18:06.630]  because they hooked you the fuck up.
[18:06.630 --> 18:08.030]  You guys aren't in the room to see it,
[18:08.030 --> 18:10.310]  but homie pulled out a big, a big, big bag.
[18:10.310 --> 18:11.670]  I call that a quarter pound bag.
[18:11.670 --> 18:12.510]  Yeah, easy.
[18:12.510 --> 18:13.990]  That's a quarter pound bag filled with seeds.
[18:13.990 --> 18:16.710]  And then also shout out to La Plata Labs.
[18:16.710 --> 18:17.550]  Josh is the shit.
[18:17.550 --> 18:18.590]  Josh is a cool ass dude.
[18:18.590 --> 18:19.750]  I fucking love Josh.
[18:19.750 --> 18:21.510]  Josh, let's go get lunch one day, bro.
[18:21.510 --> 18:22.350]  Some Thai food.
[18:22.350 --> 18:23.390]  I'm down to hang out.
[18:23.390 --> 18:24.350]  That sounds like a plan.
[18:24.350 --> 18:25.170]  Yeah, there we go.
[18:25.170 --> 18:26.390]  All of us, we're gonna go get Thai food.
[18:26.390 --> 18:27.350]  We'll invite more potheads.
[18:27.350 --> 18:28.310]  We'll go have a good time.
[18:28.310 --> 18:29.630]  I think that's all the shout outs I need to give.
[18:29.630 --> 18:32.070]  If I skipped you, I fucking apologize.
[18:32.070 --> 18:34.630]  Like I said, I smoked like six or seven grams of Shatter
[18:34.630 --> 18:35.950]  at the secret sesh.
[18:35.950 --> 18:37.630]  I appreciate everybody that hung out.
[18:37.630 --> 18:39.550]  I made some new friends.
[18:39.550 --> 18:41.870]  I know David from Rare was there too.
[18:41.870 --> 18:44.550]  Mary, aw, dude, I know your name
[18:44.550 --> 18:45.670]  and I can't think of it right now.
[18:45.670 --> 18:46.950]  Mary's Motivation, I think.
[18:46.950 --> 18:47.790]  Oh, Brett.
[18:47.790 --> 18:48.630]  Brett's the homie.
[18:48.630 --> 18:49.790]  Yeah, that guy's cool as fuck.
[18:49.790 --> 18:51.110]  He was wearing a red CBD hoodie.
[18:51.110 --> 18:52.630]  Oh, aw, that's what's up.
[18:52.630 --> 18:54.110]  I'm glad he was repping for sure.
[18:54.110 --> 18:56.110]  Yeah, dude, he's a great dude.
[18:56.110 --> 18:56.950]  Good ass dude.
[18:56.950 --> 18:57.790]  Yeah, man.
[18:57.790 --> 18:58.950]  It was really cool to meet all those people.
[18:59.270 --> 19:00.590]  I'm sorry if I didn't give you a shout out
[19:00.590 --> 19:02.790]  because like I said, we got dabbed the fuck out.
[19:02.790 --> 19:04.910]  I had to run to the green room and get snacks one time.
[19:04.910 --> 19:05.990]  I was like, I am so high.
[19:05.990 --> 19:07.630]  I gotta go to the green room and get snacks.
[19:07.630 --> 19:09.110]  I abused the shit out of that green room.
[19:09.110 --> 19:10.030]  It was really nice.
[19:11.270 --> 19:13.670]  You ever, you have a booth and stuff at the cup.
[19:13.670 --> 19:15.910]  Do you ever get to where you just need a fucking break?
[19:15.910 --> 19:17.630]  You're like, I love everybody and this is fun,
[19:17.630 --> 19:19.470]  but I just wanna go not talk to people
[19:19.470 --> 19:21.750]  and just not be here for a minute.
[19:21.750 --> 19:24.270]  Yeah, you don't get that on a year that you win a cup.
[19:24.270 --> 19:26.590]  Right, but the green room was an amazing place to have.
[19:26.590 --> 19:27.630]  I've never had that before.
[19:28.270 --> 19:29.790]  Yeah, that sounds amazing.
[19:29.790 --> 19:32.070]  Snacks and a chill place.
[19:32.070 --> 19:33.910]  No, but you're totally, yes.
[19:33.910 --> 19:34.750]  Couches and shit.
[19:34.750 --> 19:37.110]  In a cup, that's like a unicorn.
[19:37.110 --> 19:38.910]  I got to sit down for like 20 minutes
[19:38.910 --> 19:41.830]  and not like do anything while I take dabs.
[19:41.830 --> 19:44.710]  And then I had my girlfriend at the time helping
[19:44.710 --> 19:47.150]  and a friend from Miami.
[19:47.150 --> 19:51.630]  And yeah, I was so tired after day three.
[19:51.630 --> 19:53.430]  That cannabis cup was the first time you and I
[19:53.430 --> 19:55.110]  ever shook hands and met face to face.
[19:55.110 --> 19:55.950]  Very true.
[19:55.950 --> 19:57.390]  And you gave me one of those banana bars.
[19:58.150 --> 20:01.630]  Yes, and then I ended up getting some Arise.
[20:01.630 --> 20:02.710]  Yeah, yep.
[20:02.710 --> 20:04.910]  Some Arise seeds, I think maybe something else.
[20:04.910 --> 20:06.510]  I'm not sure, but yeah.
[20:06.510 --> 20:07.750]  Oh, the black cherry cams.
[20:07.750 --> 20:09.350]  Oh yeah, because that's what you asked for specifically.
[20:09.350 --> 20:10.470]  Yes, absolutely.
[20:10.470 --> 20:11.950]  I was like, yeah, it's your black cherry cam.
[20:11.950 --> 20:13.710]  That was the whole reason I've been following you for a while.
[20:13.710 --> 20:15.470]  I have to mention this while we're on this topic.
[20:15.470 --> 20:17.270]  You guys, I love the support.
[20:17.270 --> 20:18.790]  I love the cravings for my seeds,
[20:18.790 --> 20:20.190]  but I cannot ship you seeds.
[20:20.190 --> 20:21.790]  I apologize, that is illegal.
[20:21.790 --> 20:22.630]  I can't do it.
[20:22.630 --> 20:23.630]  So all you guys that are emailing me,
[20:23.630 --> 20:25.270]  that are hitting me up through the podcast,
[20:25.270 --> 20:27.070]  I'd love to get you some seeds.
[20:27.750 --> 20:28.950]  The way that you might be able to get seeds
[20:28.950 --> 20:32.830]  is to go to thedankteam.com and see what's available.
[20:32.830 --> 20:35.230]  They may have iReed genetics, they may not.
[20:35.230 --> 20:38.390]  I can recommend to you Mile High, La Plata, Sin City.
[20:38.390 --> 20:40.950]  I can highly recommend Rare Dankness.
[20:40.950 --> 20:43.270]  Cali Connection has a lot of cool shit.
[20:43.270 --> 20:45.190]  But I cannot send you seeds, you guys.
[20:45.190 --> 20:47.910]  I apologize, I'm not trying to be an asshole.
[20:47.910 --> 20:49.110]  That's just how it is in my life.
[20:49.110 --> 20:50.070]  I cannot send you seeds.
[20:50.070 --> 20:51.150]  Gotta be careful.
[20:51.150 --> 20:51.990]  Ditto.
[20:51.990 --> 20:54.270]  You can come here and I can give you some seeds.
[20:54.270 --> 20:56.110]  Well, I sent out a bunch of free CBD seeds,
[20:56.110 --> 21:01.110]  but they're all pretty much verified hemp.
[21:01.230 --> 21:03.190]  And I did it for a very short amount of time
[21:03.190 --> 21:05.990]  where I was like, yeah, I'm sending out 32 to ones.
[21:05.990 --> 21:06.830]  There you go.
[21:06.830 --> 21:09.310]  And then I had to do it again for that same reason.
[21:09.310 --> 21:11.270]  If you need CBD seeds, come to Colorado
[21:11.270 --> 21:12.750]  and Fox and I will hook you up with handfuls
[21:12.750 --> 21:13.590]  of free CBD seeds.
[21:13.590 --> 21:15.350]  Absolutely, but yeah, but there's, like you said,
[21:15.350 --> 21:17.310]  Rare Dankness, La Plata Labs.
[21:17.310 --> 21:19.790]  Mile High, Canaventure, Sour Seed Company.
[21:19.790 --> 21:20.630]  Absolutely.
[21:20.630 --> 21:21.710]  They're all good friends of ours.
[21:21.710 --> 21:22.910]  Yeah, Mr. Nice.
[21:22.910 --> 21:24.790]  Mr. Nice from old school back in the day.
[21:24.790 --> 21:26.190]  Yes, absolutely.
[21:26.190 --> 21:29.710]  I'm actually grabbing a big chunk of mango hay seeds
[21:29.710 --> 21:31.870]  because it just came known to me
[21:31.870 --> 21:34.310]  that that was the strain that I grew up on.
[21:34.310 --> 21:35.990]  I think we have a similar friend.
[21:35.990 --> 21:37.470]  Oh, no way.
[21:37.470 --> 21:39.230]  Yeah, somebody was just trying to give me mango hay seeds.
[21:39.230 --> 21:40.070]  Nice.
[21:40.070 --> 21:40.890]  Shout out to that person.
[21:40.890 --> 21:41.730]  They know who they are.
[21:41.730 --> 21:42.570]  They don't wanna be public.
[21:42.570 --> 21:44.590]  No, well, yeah, I can't wait to get my hands on these
[21:44.590 --> 21:49.070]  and get back to that, find that what I grew up on.
[21:49.070 --> 21:49.990]  Yeah.
[21:49.990 --> 21:52.070]  All right, so we talked about the events
[21:52.070 --> 21:53.550]  that we did attend and then you kind of hinted
[21:53.550 --> 21:55.030]  at events getting busted.
[21:55.030 --> 21:56.910]  Yes, quite a few.
[21:56.910 --> 21:59.790]  The Colorado Cup, shout out to Steve DeFino.
[21:59.790 --> 22:01.230]  Yeah, we'll get into that too
[22:01.230 --> 22:02.430]  because he's a good friend.
[22:02.430 --> 22:04.550]  Yeah, we should get him on here to talk about this.
[22:04.550 --> 22:07.790]  But the Colorado Cup was raided
[22:07.790 --> 22:09.390]  and I've actually got a copy of the search warrant
[22:09.390 --> 22:10.550]  on my phone if we wanted to read it,
[22:10.550 --> 22:12.590]  but I don't even know if we should delve into that.
[22:12.590 --> 22:15.150]  Well, that might be interesting actually.
[22:15.150 --> 22:17.270]  They claim to have found some drugs actually.
[22:17.270 --> 22:18.090]  Oh, really?
[22:18.090 --> 22:18.930]  In the DJ booth.
[22:18.930 --> 22:20.270]  They claim there was some drugs in the DJ booth.
[22:20.270 --> 22:21.110]  No shit.
[22:21.510 --> 22:24.870]  Also, the DJ booth was the only room without a camera.
[22:24.870 --> 22:26.030]  So who knows?
[22:26.030 --> 22:26.870]  Yeah.
[22:26.870 --> 22:28.510]  It's hard to say what happened there.
[22:28.510 --> 22:29.350]  Definitely.
[22:29.350 --> 22:31.750]  But so there was an event at a place called Riggs R Us
[22:31.750 --> 22:32.810]  and it was the Colorado Cup
[22:32.810 --> 22:34.630]  and it was an event similar to a Cannabis Cup
[22:34.630 --> 22:36.230]  where people enter their strains of cannabis,
[22:36.230 --> 22:39.190]  extracts, edibles, and cannabis wares and whatnots
[22:39.190 --> 22:42.150]  and people judge them and they decided a winner.
[22:42.150 --> 22:45.870]  On 420 at 3 p.m., the Denver City Police came in
[22:45.870 --> 22:49.070]  with bandanas on their faces and shotguns in their hands,
[22:49.070 --> 22:50.630]  kicked in the front doors and started yelling,
[22:51.150 --> 22:52.390]  get out, get out, get out.
[22:52.390 --> 22:53.670]  And half of the people that were in there
[22:53.670 --> 22:54.910]  thought the place was getting robbed
[22:54.910 --> 22:56.570]  because they did not announce that they were police
[22:56.570 --> 22:58.870]  until everybody left and everybody was on the ground.
[22:58.870 --> 23:00.430]  Then a uniformed officer walked in
[23:00.430 --> 23:02.750]  and delivered a search warrant.
[23:02.750 --> 23:03.570]  Yeah.
[23:03.570 --> 23:04.470]  After everything was all, yeah.
[23:04.470 --> 23:06.470]  So everybody thought the place was getting fucking robbed.
[23:06.470 --> 23:07.410]  I had a friend who was there.
[23:07.410 --> 23:08.710]  She sent me a bunch of stuff.
[23:08.710 --> 23:09.550]  Wow.
[23:09.550 --> 23:11.630]  Yeah, she sent me a video from the place.
[23:11.630 --> 23:14.790]  The cops that first went in just looked like thugs
[23:14.790 --> 23:17.550]  in dickies and combat boots and bandanas
[23:17.550 --> 23:19.050]  and they were followed by armed cops
[23:19.090 --> 23:21.810]  who were then followed by riot cops
[23:21.810 --> 23:23.610]  just to come shut down any illegal smoke.
[23:23.610 --> 23:27.010]  A bunch of peaceful fucking stoners?
[23:27.010 --> 23:28.170]  Yeah, exactly.
[23:28.170 --> 23:29.570]  They needed riot gear.
[23:29.570 --> 23:31.250]  How much of our tax money was that?
[23:31.250 --> 23:32.690]  A lot and actually.
[23:32.690 --> 23:34.850]  Sounds like 60 grand from what you just said.
[23:34.850 --> 23:37.610]  There were several MacBooks being used
[23:37.610 --> 23:40.050]  for data entry for the cup that was happening
[23:40.050 --> 23:42.650]  and these cops poured bottled water all over the MacBooks.
[23:42.650 --> 23:43.490]  Are you fucking serious?
[23:43.490 --> 23:45.170]  Just dumped bottles of water over the MacBooks, yeah.
[23:45.170 --> 23:46.050]  Wow.
[23:46.050 --> 23:47.050]  Yeah, for no reason.
[23:47.050 --> 23:47.890]  Destruction of property.
[23:48.250 --> 23:49.090]  I was not there.
[23:49.090 --> 23:50.850]  No, yeah, yeah, but I mean, you know.
[23:50.850 --> 23:52.810]  Those are some serious claims.
[23:52.810 --> 23:54.170]  Shout out to my source on the street.
[23:54.170 --> 23:58.130]  Yeah, and the Denver PD doesn't have the cleanest record
[23:58.130 --> 24:02.090]  for how they deal with public affairs.
[24:02.090 --> 24:03.850]  Do we wanna read any of the, I can read you.
[24:03.850 --> 24:04.690]  Absolutely.
[24:04.690 --> 24:06.930]  There was 38 charges filed against these folks.
[24:06.930 --> 24:07.770]  I can go find the message.
[24:07.770 --> 24:09.330]  Okay, so while you find the message,
[24:09.330 --> 24:12.050]  I'll delve into AJ Hashman a little bit.
[24:12.050 --> 24:13.170]  What's up, AJ?
[24:13.170 --> 24:15.010]  So, here's the thing with AJ.
[24:15.010 --> 24:17.730]  And I'm not one to talk shit or say anything ill of anyone,
[24:18.570 --> 24:21.010]  but I'll tell you my first experience with him.
[24:21.010 --> 24:25.210]  Back last year, do you remember the Gypsy Jane Fest?
[24:25.210 --> 24:26.050]  A little bit.
[24:26.050 --> 24:27.690]  I did take it, but I remember seeing the posts.
[24:27.690 --> 24:29.330]  It was a huge joke.
[24:29.330 --> 24:30.930]  I mean, they got Snoop to come in
[24:30.930 --> 24:33.730]  to do whatever he did for a few minutes.
[24:33.730 --> 24:35.290]  Half the artists didn't show up.
[24:36.770 --> 24:40.290]  The company running it lied about ticket sales.
[24:40.290 --> 24:41.690]  A lot of vendors got fucked.
[24:41.690 --> 24:45.450]  Some people bought $40,000 booths and recouped nothing.
[24:45.450 --> 24:48.450]  On top of that, it was like a three-day event.
[24:48.450 --> 24:51.210]  And on the second day, a lot of these people's stuff
[24:51.210 --> 24:53.930]  got broken into, and the guys that came in
[24:53.930 --> 24:55.930]  to promote the event and help build it,
[24:55.930 --> 24:58.850]  it all left and left everything high and dry.
[24:58.850 --> 25:02.610]  So, AJ's role in this was they had seeked him out
[25:02.610 --> 25:07.610]  to do the judging portion of the edible competition
[25:11.890 --> 25:13.730]  and concentrate competition.
[25:13.770 --> 25:18.250]  And what ended up happening was he took 17 grams or 14,
[25:18.250 --> 25:20.850]  I can't remember, it was over half an ounce
[25:20.850 --> 25:23.010]  of concentrate from us and told us
[25:23.010 --> 25:25.410]  that no dispensaries would be entering
[25:25.410 --> 25:27.610]  and that it would just be an independent thing.
[25:27.610 --> 25:28.570]  And I said, sure, why not?
[25:28.570 --> 25:30.290]  I mean, we made the time, got some flour,
[25:30.290 --> 25:35.010]  we ran it, whatever the case was, and it was okay.
[25:35.010 --> 25:38.410]  But, fuck, I can't remember the name of them.
[25:38.410 --> 25:41.090]  The clinic or someone who had just gone rec
[25:41.090 --> 25:43.650]  came in and bought fucking ounces of their shit
[25:44.570 --> 25:47.570]  and turned in entry for every category
[25:47.570 --> 25:49.450]  and just kind of voided everything he said.
[25:49.450 --> 25:53.050]  So, on top of that, we found out
[25:53.050 --> 25:56.250]  that my entry was never judged, and this was a year ago.
[25:56.250 --> 25:58.650]  So, let's flash forward to Colorado Cup.
[25:58.650 --> 26:01.530]  Steve DeFino and his flour entry.
[26:01.530 --> 26:03.530]  He had two entries, his Cheesequake,
[26:03.530 --> 26:05.370]  which I can personally say as an extractor,
[26:05.370 --> 26:06.850]  as a grower, as a breeder, you know,
[26:06.850 --> 26:08.250]  he does great fucking work.
[26:08.250 --> 26:11.290]  I'd love to extract it, I'd love to squish it,
[26:11.290 --> 26:13.410]  it's super terpy material, I love it.
[26:15.570 --> 26:18.130]  He also entered your Heart of Gold.
[26:18.130 --> 26:18.970]  Heart of Gold, yes.
[26:18.970 --> 26:20.410]  Which is a Golden Goat cross, correct?
[26:20.410 --> 26:21.690]  Golden Goat, Grateful Dog.
[26:21.690 --> 26:25.570]  Yeah, so very sativa dominant cross, you would say.
[26:25.570 --> 26:26.850]  Oh, yeah. Okay.
[26:26.850 --> 26:31.850]  So, in the whole scheme of things,
[26:31.970 --> 26:34.610]  what you just said, it got raided,
[26:34.610 --> 26:37.610]  Steve almost lost his possessions,
[26:37.610 --> 26:39.770]  or whatever the case was, because of that whole thing.
[26:39.810 --> 26:42.130]  He ended up getting in, and they were giving him shit,
[26:42.130 --> 26:43.570]  or whatever the case was.
[26:43.570 --> 26:45.090]  But he didn't find out until a few days later,
[26:45.090 --> 26:47.850]  after they announced the winnings,
[26:47.850 --> 26:50.170]  that his entries weren't even judged.
[26:50.170 --> 26:53.290]  Which, you know, is typical of something that AJ would do.
[26:53.290 --> 26:56.090]  Now, let's rewind a little bit again.
[26:56.090 --> 26:57.130]  He would do these things,
[26:57.130 --> 26:59.370]  and promote these events called Canna Raves,
[26:59.370 --> 27:00.770]  and whatever the case was.
[27:00.770 --> 27:03.290]  I wasn't really around for them, I've just only heard.
[27:03.290 --> 27:04.890]  And it's the same similar thing.
[27:04.890 --> 27:06.490]  You wouldn't get permits for anything,
[27:06.490 --> 27:08.730]  the cops would constantly come to the events,
[27:08.770 --> 27:10.090]  the vendors would get fucked,
[27:10.090 --> 27:11.530]  because he would collect money.
[27:11.530 --> 27:15.010]  He was charging more money for what he was like,
[27:15.010 --> 27:18.930]  oh, if you want your entry tested, $40.
[27:18.930 --> 27:20.730]  What that actually cost was 25.
[27:20.730 --> 27:25.730]  So, he was actually skimming off the top of every entry,
[27:25.770 --> 27:28.690]  that was made on top of what he was getting.
[27:28.690 --> 27:32.010]  So, it's kind of like, you know,
[27:32.010 --> 27:34.010]  I can understand why someone would be upset.
[27:34.010 --> 27:36.170]  Steve, our good friend Steve,
[27:36.210 --> 27:39.290]  was not too happy when he heard that, you know?
[27:39.290 --> 27:41.010]  And it was verified.
[27:41.010 --> 27:44.930]  And I just feel like,
[27:44.930 --> 27:47.010]  one, people with that kind of track record
[27:47.010 --> 27:48.250]  should just not do events.
[27:48.250 --> 27:50.250]  I have nothing ill to say about AJ, dude.
[27:50.250 --> 27:51.610]  Fucking hell, smoke with you, whatever.
[27:51.610 --> 27:54.250]  But I can't say the same for Steve,
[27:54.250 --> 27:55.410]  or some of the other competitors,
[27:55.410 --> 27:56.890]  as you kind of fucked over.
[27:56.890 --> 27:58.130]  So, that being said,
[27:59.050 --> 28:01.370]  me and Steve have been talking about
[28:01.370 --> 28:03.050]  authenticity and competition,
[28:03.050 --> 28:05.050]  and trying to do something more towards that.
[28:05.050 --> 28:09.530]  But that was a huge bust on their part of the competition.
[28:09.530 --> 28:13.410]  And, you know, yeah.
[28:13.410 --> 28:15.050]  I wish it hadn't gone that way.
[28:15.050 --> 28:17.090]  When people told me about the Colorado Cup,
[28:17.090 --> 28:18.690]  I asked who was throwing it.
[28:18.690 --> 28:19.890]  And when I heard who it was,
[28:19.890 --> 28:21.650]  I kind of had to pull from it,
[28:21.650 --> 28:24.370]  knowing that one, the cops really had to get involved,
[28:24.370 --> 28:26.890]  or two, my entry is going to be taken.
[28:26.890 --> 28:28.570]  And, you know, it could just go to Patience,
[28:28.570 --> 28:29.690]  if that's the case, you know?
[28:29.690 --> 28:31.250]  Like, why bother?
[28:31.250 --> 28:32.090]  So.
[28:32.090 --> 28:33.570]  So, that reminds me that I did not do a shout out
[28:33.570 --> 28:36.490]  to the venue where we held the secret sesh.
[28:36.490 --> 28:38.570]  I don't know that I want to say the name of the venue,
[28:38.570 --> 28:39.410]  because we're going to do it again.
[28:39.410 --> 28:40.810]  No, because it's a secret, dog.
[28:40.810 --> 28:41.690]  And it's a secret.
[28:41.690 --> 28:43.130]  So, big shout out to the venue.
[28:43.130 --> 28:45.330]  It's cool as fuck.
[28:45.330 --> 28:47.050]  That place is rad, dude.
[28:47.050 --> 28:48.050]  Yeah.
[28:48.050 --> 28:50.810]  Word on the street is we're doing secret sesh again in May.
[28:50.810 --> 28:53.450]  And there is a good chance that Rasta Jeff
[28:53.450 --> 28:54.570]  will be the co-host,
[28:54.570 --> 28:56.730]  because in June and July,
[28:56.730 --> 28:58.890]  I will be the host of the secret sesh,
[28:58.890 --> 28:59.890]  if things go our way.
[28:59.890 --> 29:00.730]  Cool.
[29:00.730 --> 29:01.650]  I might not be supposed to say that,
[29:01.650 --> 29:02.930]  so only listeners can know that shit.
[29:02.970 --> 29:04.210]  Don't tell anybody, you guys.
[29:04.210 --> 29:05.330]  Yeah, don't tell anyone.
[29:05.330 --> 29:06.930]  It's all a secret, yeah.
[29:06.930 --> 29:08.330]  Yeah, Adamil and I are going to get together
[29:08.330 --> 29:09.250]  and talk a little bit about it.
[29:09.250 --> 29:11.210]  I'll probably be hosting.
[29:11.210 --> 29:12.050]  Yeah, what?
[29:12.050 --> 29:12.970]  Yeah, what?
[29:15.970 --> 29:17.490]  It's going to get ridiculous up there.
[29:17.490 --> 29:19.210]  So, I found a list of,
[29:19.210 --> 29:21.410]  this is the inventory that was confiscated
[29:21.410 --> 29:22.570]  by the Denver police.
[29:22.570 --> 29:24.250]  Oh, interesting.
[29:24.250 --> 29:25.770]  And there are 20 articles,
[29:25.770 --> 29:27.970]  20 items listed on the front page.
[29:27.970 --> 29:29.010]  And it says, number one,
[29:29.010 --> 29:31.450]  marijuana concentrate in the basement storage area.
[29:31.450 --> 29:33.930]  Number two, marijuana in the basement office.
[29:33.930 --> 29:35.330]  Number three, marijuana concentrate
[29:35.330 --> 29:37.050]  in the basement storage.
[29:37.050 --> 29:38.370]  They list marijuana concentrate,
[29:38.370 --> 29:41.210]  marijuana concentrate, marijuana basement,
[29:41.210 --> 29:43.050]  suspected meth basement,
[29:43.050 --> 29:45.050]  marijuana concentrate basement,
[29:45.050 --> 29:47.170]  marijuana dab room,
[29:47.170 --> 29:48.970]  marijuana concentrate basement bar,
[29:48.970 --> 29:50.770]  marijuana basement bar,
[29:50.770 --> 29:55.090]  marijuana cookies on the back patio,
[29:55.090 --> 29:56.650]  meth in DJ room.
[29:56.650 --> 29:58.410]  Those might've been some ones on there.
[29:58.410 --> 30:00.090]  Unknown oil in the DJ room.
[30:00.090 --> 30:01.250]  Well, that's probably just Earl.
[30:01.890 --> 30:02.890]  That's probably reclaim.
[30:02.890 --> 30:03.730]  And they're like,
[30:03.730 --> 30:06.250]  we're going to charge them for this too.
[30:06.250 --> 30:08.010]  Suspected ecstasy in the DJ room.
[30:08.010 --> 30:09.690]  Suspected cocaine in the DJ room.
[30:09.690 --> 30:11.330]  Unknown oil in the DJ room.
[30:11.330 --> 30:13.650]  Marijuana near press outside.
[30:13.650 --> 30:14.490]  Ha ha ha.
[30:14.490 --> 30:15.330]  Ha ha ha.
[30:15.330 --> 30:16.170]  Ha ha ha.
[30:16.170 --> 30:17.010]  Ha ha ha.
[30:17.010 --> 30:19.530]  Yeah, that's, that's charges.
[30:19.530 --> 30:21.010]  It's very funny.
[30:21.010 --> 30:22.410]  Let's see, marijuana,
[30:22.410 --> 30:24.810]  just Jim's crystal collection.
[30:24.810 --> 30:27.050]  Wallet with ID in the DJ room.
[30:27.050 --> 30:28.730]  Scale in the DJ room.
[30:28.730 --> 30:30.010]  So, this piece of paper right here
[30:30.050 --> 30:32.290]  leads me to believe that the DJ is fucked.
[30:32.290 --> 30:33.130]  Yeah.
[30:33.130 --> 30:34.570]  Ha ha ha.
[30:34.570 --> 30:36.890]  Unless it's AJ's ID in the DJ room.
[30:36.890 --> 30:37.730]  Oh man.
[30:37.730 --> 30:38.770]  Ha ha ha.
[30:38.770 --> 30:41.250]  I just, the legal disclaimer,
[30:41.250 --> 30:42.770]  Ross and Jeff and the Girl From Your Heart podcast
[30:42.770 --> 30:45.290]  has no evidence against AJ Hashman in any wrongdoing.
[30:45.290 --> 30:48.090]  These are all the opinions of Kabuki J Fox.
[30:48.090 --> 30:49.250]  This is all allegedly.
[30:49.250 --> 30:50.090]  Yep.
[30:50.090 --> 30:51.410]  Whatever other legal ground we have to cover there.
[30:51.410 --> 30:52.250]  Who knows?
[30:52.250 --> 30:53.490]  The same goes, this is all the,
[30:53.490 --> 30:55.730]  I'm telling you my personal experience with him.
[30:55.730 --> 30:58.130]  I'm in no way trying to.
[30:58.130 --> 30:59.570]  Mike just got a phone call and says he has to go.
[31:00.130 --> 31:01.170]  We're gonna press pause and I'm gonna check on my friend.
[31:01.170 --> 31:02.010]  Make things are good.
[31:02.010 --> 31:02.850]  All right.
[31:02.850 --> 31:03.690]  And we'll be right back with the podcast.
[31:03.690 --> 31:04.770]  Yeah folks, sorry, I got her bused.
[31:04.770 --> 31:07.610]  All right you guys, we are back.
[31:07.610 --> 31:08.450]  Mike had to take off.
[31:08.450 --> 31:09.970]  I apologize for having to cut off the show.
[31:09.970 --> 31:10.810]  Everything is cool.
[31:10.810 --> 31:12.930]  Mike just had to give somebody an unexpected ride.
[31:12.930 --> 31:13.770]  Not an emergency.
[31:13.770 --> 31:14.850]  Shout out to Mike.
[31:14.850 --> 31:16.170]  Shout out to the little guy.
[31:16.170 --> 31:17.010]  Yeah.
[31:17.010 --> 31:19.370]  I hope the prom went well, my friend.
[31:19.370 --> 31:20.290]  All right.
[31:20.290 --> 31:21.130]  So where were we?
[31:21.130 --> 31:23.250]  We were kind of in the middle of slandering AJ Hashman.
[31:23.250 --> 31:24.450]  Yeah, well not really.
[31:24.450 --> 31:25.730]  I was expressing my views,
[31:25.730 --> 31:27.690]  which had nothing to do with you, by the way.
[31:27.690 --> 31:29.090]  Thank you for letting me express them.
[31:29.610 --> 31:31.890]  But I am expressing them on the behalf of my friend Steve,
[31:31.890 --> 31:34.850]  who really feels like he got shafted.
[31:34.850 --> 31:36.530]  And it's just unfortunate, you know,
[31:36.530 --> 31:39.410]  because I tried to warn him and him being a good person,
[31:39.410 --> 31:40.810]  tried to give him the benefit of the doubt.
[31:40.810 --> 31:42.430]  And hey, it's like,
[31:45.210 --> 31:46.130]  it's like chlamydia.
[31:46.130 --> 31:48.810]  You learn your lesson once with that shit.
[31:48.810 --> 31:50.810]  And AJ is just kind of like,
[31:50.810 --> 31:52.890]  dealing with him in a business sense
[31:52.890 --> 31:53.970]  is never a wonderful thing.
[31:53.970 --> 31:55.730]  You're not looking to go back and get burned twice.
[31:55.730 --> 31:56.570]  No, absolutely.
[31:56.570 --> 31:57.410]  You never know.
[31:57.410 --> 31:59.370]  So you learn your lesson and that's it.
[31:59.370 --> 32:00.210]  That is what it is.
[32:00.210 --> 32:02.370]  I'm gonna give a shout out to Steve DeFino.
[32:02.370 --> 32:04.090]  Steve DeFino, if you'd like to come on the podcast,
[32:04.090 --> 32:05.710]  once again, we can meet up at the Canyon.
[32:05.710 --> 32:06.550]  You can come to my house.
[32:06.550 --> 32:07.530]  I know you're in Colorado Springs,
[32:07.530 --> 32:09.090]  so it may be easier for me to come to you.
[32:09.090 --> 32:10.930]  You should come down to Pueblo, Steve.
[32:10.930 --> 32:13.250]  Well, either way, there's a third chair now since Mike left.
[32:13.250 --> 32:14.970]  So Steve, you're invited.
[32:14.970 --> 32:16.530]  Anyway, Steve, I'd love to have you on the show.
[32:16.530 --> 32:18.170]  If you've got anything you'd ever like to say,
[32:18.170 --> 32:19.690]  if you'd like to talk about the VFA,
[32:19.690 --> 32:21.490]  if you'd like to talk about events,
[32:21.490 --> 32:23.330]  bro, this is partly your show as well.
[32:23.330 --> 32:25.050]  You've always got a welcome seat on the show.
[32:25.050 --> 32:25.930]  I appreciate what you do.
[32:25.930 --> 32:27.290]  I respect what you do.
[32:27.290 --> 32:28.810]  I've actually got an email from somebody
[32:28.810 --> 32:29.950]  who is trying to get in touch
[32:29.950 --> 32:31.210]  with the Veteran Farmers Alliance.
[32:31.210 --> 32:33.050]  So I do need to put you in touch with them.
[32:33.050 --> 32:34.050]  Steve, we appreciate you.
[32:34.050 --> 32:34.870]  That's what we're trying to say.
[32:34.870 --> 32:36.290]  You're part of the team, bro.
[32:36.290 --> 32:37.130]  We've got your back.
[32:37.130 --> 32:38.130]  We want to support you.
[32:39.090 --> 32:42.010]  So let's move on from the AJ Hashman,
[32:42.010 --> 32:43.370]  the Bashman session here.
[32:43.370 --> 32:46.290]  That was good.
[32:46.290 --> 32:48.490]  I'm gonna use that as a hashtag.
[32:48.490 --> 32:49.330]  Bashman.
[32:49.330 --> 32:50.810]  Hashman, Bashman.
[32:50.810 --> 32:53.330]  Let's actually, we're 30 minutes into this podcast.
[32:53.330 --> 32:56.210]  Let's talk about some CBD stuff.
[32:56.210 --> 32:57.570]  Okay.
[32:57.570 --> 32:58.570]  I've got a thing on my phone.
[32:58.570 --> 32:59.930]  Let me find, I just took a screenshot
[32:59.930 --> 33:01.010]  of a message somebody sent me.
[33:01.010 --> 33:02.890]  I know everything is in our damn phones these days.
[33:02.890 --> 33:03.730]  Yeah, I know.
[33:03.730 --> 33:07.370]  It's crazy stupid how much these things are like lifelines.
[33:07.370 --> 33:10.410]  This guy says, I'm gonna summarize a little bit.
[33:10.410 --> 33:12.450]  He says his mother-in-law has Parkinson's
[33:12.450 --> 33:14.610]  and is really against pharmaceuticals.
[33:14.610 --> 33:16.570]  It's to the point where she's really getting bad.
[33:16.570 --> 33:18.910]  After listening to countless hours of my show,
[33:18.910 --> 33:21.010]  this listener figured that I may have an idea
[33:21.010 --> 33:23.690]  as far as strains and whatnot.
[33:23.690 --> 33:27.330]  She is onto the idea of medical marijuana,
[33:27.330 --> 33:31.010]  but has it in her mind that the CBD available in Texas
[33:31.010 --> 33:32.250]  will not help.
[33:32.250 --> 33:35.010]  And this person is sure that they won't.
[33:35.010 --> 33:36.390]  If we could please lay some knowledge
[33:36.390 --> 33:38.850]  on this listener about this.
[33:38.850 --> 33:41.690]  There's a whole family that would appreciate it.
[33:41.690 --> 33:43.970]  First of all, I'm gonna be a grammar Nazi.
[33:43.970 --> 33:46.590]  Let's correct the world here with CBDs.
[33:47.810 --> 33:49.690]  Let's just start saying CBD.
[33:49.690 --> 33:51.610]  CBDs is not pluralized.
[33:51.610 --> 33:54.490]  The same way that we don't pluralize THCs.
[33:54.490 --> 33:55.330]  Right.
[33:55.330 --> 33:57.410]  You know, it's just, we don't do it.
[33:57.410 --> 33:58.450]  Or water.
[33:58.450 --> 33:59.730]  Yeah, water.
[33:59.730 --> 34:01.690]  Yeah, you don't say I wanna get some waters.
[34:01.690 --> 34:03.530]  I wanna get all the waters out of this glass.
[34:03.530 --> 34:05.010]  It's, yeah, it's CBD.
[34:06.210 --> 34:07.370]  This is for everybody.
[34:07.370 --> 34:08.210]  Yeah.
[34:08.210 --> 34:10.030]  And also since I'm on this, it's not strands,
[34:10.030 --> 34:10.870]  it is strains.
[34:10.870 --> 34:12.790]  Strands are hair, strains are cannabis.
[34:12.790 --> 34:14.810]  If you wanna get specific, you could say cultivar
[34:14.810 --> 34:18.010]  or varietal, but let's just not say fucking strands.
[34:18.010 --> 34:19.850]  I haven't heard the strands in a while.
[34:19.850 --> 34:20.690]  Yeah, I heard it the other day.
[34:20.690 --> 34:21.510]  Sorry for my ego.
[34:21.510 --> 34:22.350]  I heard it the other day.
[34:22.350 --> 34:23.810]  It made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.
[34:23.810 --> 34:26.410]  I was like, you're so pretty and you just said strands?
[34:26.410 --> 34:27.250]  I'm leaving.
[34:27.250 --> 34:28.090]  Oh.
[34:28.090 --> 34:28.910]  Yeah.
[34:28.910 --> 34:31.010]  So this guy, and also since we are,
[34:31.010 --> 34:32.690]  we're making jokes about this,
[34:32.690 --> 34:36.510]  but I'm sorry your mother-in-law has Parkinson's.
[34:36.510 --> 34:38.050]  That is terrible to hear about.
[34:38.050 --> 34:40.730]  And Fox is the guy here that is great at helping
[34:40.730 --> 34:41.850]  with this type of stuff.
[34:41.850 --> 34:45.210]  So first he wants to know if we can recommend a strain
[34:45.210 --> 34:46.730]  that would help with Parkinson's.
[34:46.730 --> 34:47.570]  Okay.
[34:48.090 --> 34:50.170]  So there's a few options.
[34:50.170 --> 34:52.770]  If she's okay with the cannabis,
[34:52.770 --> 34:55.050]  then there's a few one-to-one options that we can go with
[34:55.050 --> 34:56.490]  that would be wonderful.
[34:57.890 --> 34:59.790]  Toro, Bora being one of them.
[35:00.650 --> 35:04.250]  Toro, Sue, Harlequin, which I think comes in
[35:04.250 --> 35:06.410]  at a three-to-one or two-to-one.
[35:06.410 --> 35:10.450]  And certain cases, seven-to-one, another great strain.
[35:12.010 --> 35:14.490]  If she's coming around or slowly coming around
[35:14.490 --> 35:17.130]  to the idea of medical cannabis,
[35:17.650 --> 35:20.010]  I would say start her off with the higher CBD strains
[35:20.010 --> 35:23.170]  to higher ratio of CBD to THC.
[35:23.170 --> 35:24.930]  Auto from Centennial Seeds.
[35:24.930 --> 35:26.410]  Oh, that's a great example.
[35:26.410 --> 35:28.610]  So obviously you're in Texas,
[35:28.610 --> 35:30.250]  so your options are very limited.
[35:30.250 --> 35:34.890]  And unless you can get a specific cut of this,
[35:34.890 --> 35:37.970]  of what I'm talking about on the ACDC side at least,
[35:37.970 --> 35:40.410]  you're gonna have to go with something like the auto.
[35:40.410 --> 35:42.810]  But from what I understand, it's like 120 to one.
[35:44.090 --> 35:45.410]  So when he keeps saying, I'm gonna interrupt you,
[35:45.410 --> 35:48.170]  I'm sorry, he keeps saying 120 to one or two to one,
[35:48.170 --> 35:51.210]  we're talking about THC to CBD ratios.
[35:51.210 --> 35:54.050]  And we're trying to find the higher CBD ratio for you
[35:54.050 --> 35:54.890]  is what we need.
[35:54.890 --> 35:57.850]  So that she's not gonna get the killer head buzz,
[35:57.850 --> 35:59.550]  she's not gonna be high and giggly.
[35:59.550 --> 36:01.730]  She's actually gonna get the medicinal benefits
[36:01.730 --> 36:05.730]  from the cannabis because it's higher in CBD than THC.
[36:05.730 --> 36:06.570]  I just wanted to clear that up.
[36:06.570 --> 36:08.770]  You keep, I don't know how many people understand
[36:08.770 --> 36:09.610]  the ratio aspect of this.
[36:09.610 --> 36:10.430]  No, absolutely not.
[36:10.430 --> 36:12.410]  Thank you for...
[36:12.410 --> 36:13.930]  I try not to go past people too quickly.
[36:13.930 --> 36:14.930]  No, you're fine.
[36:14.930 --> 36:15.770]  That's great.
[36:15.770 --> 36:17.650]  Because I forget to elaborate on that sometimes.
[36:17.650 --> 36:19.090]  I'm not the best at that.
[36:19.090 --> 36:21.810]  So yeah, that being said, and like you said,
[36:21.810 --> 36:24.730]  Centennial Seeds, auto would be great.
[36:24.730 --> 36:29.730]  I think CBD Crew is another seed company
[36:29.810 --> 36:31.170]  that would be able to help.
[36:32.090 --> 36:35.650]  Booms Farm also has some strains that are,
[36:35.650 --> 36:39.490]  like I said, you can tell them what your situation
[36:39.490 --> 36:43.090]  is where you are and they'll be able to help you
[36:43.130 --> 36:45.010]  with their strain list and give you something
[36:45.010 --> 36:48.610]  that will keep you in the legal boundaries
[36:48.610 --> 36:49.450]  of what you need.
[36:49.450 --> 36:51.810]  But to just, let's say with the auto.
[36:51.810 --> 36:53.370]  The autos are great to start off with
[36:53.370 --> 36:55.330]  and let's just say why.
[36:55.330 --> 36:58.290]  So CBD is a neuroprotectant.
[36:58.290 --> 37:02.390]  There's been a few cases done on the effects of CBD
[37:02.390 --> 37:06.850]  on Parkinson's and it absolutely helps
[37:06.850 --> 37:08.570]  with the confusion.
[37:08.570 --> 37:10.530]  It helps with the tremors.
[37:10.530 --> 37:15.010]  It helps with a lot of the symptoms that you see
[37:15.010 --> 37:17.770]  usually with that disease or anything
[37:17.770 --> 37:19.510]  and related to that condition.
[37:20.610 --> 37:22.810]  So yes, obviously it's a huge help.
[37:23.730 --> 37:27.250]  Tensures, sublingual dosing,
[37:28.690 --> 37:29.970]  depending on what the case is,
[37:29.970 --> 37:31.990]  is usually, would be the quickest.
[37:33.010 --> 37:38.010]  There are CBD ready products that can also,
[37:38.770 --> 37:39.910]  that you can get.
[37:41.010 --> 37:43.770]  I'm sorry that the company's eluding me at this point
[37:43.770 --> 37:46.850]  because I don't, I just can't think of it to mind.
[37:46.850 --> 37:48.650]  But there are those products available
[37:48.650 --> 37:51.810]  if you need something quicker than just growing,
[37:51.810 --> 37:53.090]  what will help her?
[37:53.090 --> 37:56.110]  Part of his question was that he does not believe
[37:56.110 --> 37:58.930]  that the CBD products available in Texas
[37:58.930 --> 38:00.390]  will be of much use.
[38:00.390 --> 38:01.770]  And I asked him more questions about this.
[38:01.770 --> 38:03.570]  We had a little short conversation
[38:03.570 --> 38:06.290]  on the Instagram Messenger here.
[38:06.290 --> 38:08.250]  I asked him, he said he doesn't feel like the CBD
[38:08.250 --> 38:10.010]  available there in Texas will help.
[38:11.210 --> 38:12.330]  And he's sure that they won't.
[38:12.330 --> 38:13.690]  And then he asked me how I felt about that.
[38:13.690 --> 38:15.450]  And I asked why he doesn't feel like the CBD
[38:15.450 --> 38:16.290]  there will help.
[38:16.290 --> 38:17.110]  I have the same question.
[38:17.110 --> 38:20.370]  He said that he doesn't believe it's going to be CBD oil,
[38:20.370 --> 38:21.450]  which we've seen a lot.
[38:21.450 --> 38:23.250]  People just sell CBD oil and it ends up
[38:23.250 --> 38:25.810]  just being 100% cod oil and they're just mislabeling it.
[38:25.810 --> 38:28.030]  So then I'm gonna be more specific then.
[38:29.890 --> 38:32.210]  I'll start off by giving out my email.
[38:32.210 --> 38:34.650]  You know, and this can go out and I don't mind.
[38:34.650 --> 38:37.550]  Foxtractcbd at gmail.com.
[38:38.730 --> 38:40.170]  Even if it's not directly through me,
[38:40.170 --> 38:45.170]  I will happily direct you through a verified hemp oil sale,
[38:45.930 --> 38:49.070]  you know, growers, farmers, extractors.
[38:50.110 --> 38:52.690]  I also know a few slew of companies that already make
[38:52.690 --> 38:55.650]  50 state ready CBD products that are legitimate.
[38:55.650 --> 38:57.770]  They're backed up by testing.
[38:57.770 --> 38:59.450]  They, you know, will have testing for everything
[38:59.450 --> 39:04.070]  from potency, pesticides to mildew and heavy metals.
[39:04.710 --> 39:06.030]  And you know, an infused product.
[39:06.030 --> 39:09.670]  So, yeah, shit.
[39:09.670 --> 39:12.470]  I'm so sorry that it's living on the products,
[39:12.470 --> 39:15.510]  but you can always get at me and I will happily,
[39:15.510 --> 39:17.270]  you know, I've got them all on my phone,
[39:17.270 --> 39:18.430]  which is right next to me.
[39:18.430 --> 39:20.190]  I will go ahead and take a look in your phone.
[39:20.190 --> 39:21.030]  Yeah, let me see.
[39:21.030 --> 39:22.430]  I'll do my best to get the links.
[39:22.430 --> 39:24.470]  Also, I'll get Fox's email address again
[39:24.470 --> 39:26.310]  so that you guys don't have to rewind the show.
[39:26.310 --> 39:28.750]  I'll put all this stuff in the show notes
[39:28.750 --> 39:30.630]  so that you guys can easily go and find that.
[39:30.630 --> 39:33.470]  I'll leave some links there in the show notes for you.
[39:33.470 --> 39:35.390]  That would be probably the most helpful thing
[39:35.390 --> 39:36.270]  that I can do.
[39:36.270 --> 39:38.590]  Is this CBD legal in Texas?
[39:38.590 --> 39:40.270]  The CBD product you're talking about.
[39:40.270 --> 39:41.270]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[39:41.270 --> 39:42.430]  Okay.
[39:42.430 --> 39:45.470]  You know, I was working with Halo Labs for a while,
[39:45.470 --> 39:47.670]  which, and they were doing an isolate
[39:47.670 --> 39:52.310]  that we were getting back 99.5 or 57%.
[39:52.310 --> 39:56.470]  And I infused a lot of 50 state legal products
[39:56.470 --> 39:58.470]  with a lot of those hard candies and lollipops
[39:58.470 --> 39:59.910]  that I made were 50 state legal.
[39:59.950 --> 40:03.470]  And I sent those out for free to a lot of people
[40:03.470 --> 40:05.430]  because they were skeptical about that.
[40:05.430 --> 40:08.310]  And just to get an idea, some people,
[40:08.310 --> 40:10.350]  obviously we support whole plant cannabis.
[40:10.350 --> 40:12.670]  I mean, both is best.
[40:12.670 --> 40:13.790]  The whole plant is best.
[40:13.790 --> 40:16.430]  But if you're in a situation or have a condition
[40:16.430 --> 40:19.150]  where it's more neurologically tied,
[40:19.150 --> 40:22.510]  then higher concentrations of CBD is where you wanna be.
[40:22.510 --> 40:24.790]  And so everything has its place.
[40:24.790 --> 40:25.990]  I don't knock one thing or another
[40:25.990 --> 40:29.790]  when it comes to anything cannabis related.
[40:30.630 --> 40:35.630]  So there is a company called CBD underscore Pure Med Slab.
[40:40.310 --> 40:44.350]  And they are some of the biggest wholesalers out here.
[40:44.350 --> 40:46.790]  And that's on Instagram.
[40:46.790 --> 40:51.790]  And I'll repeat that at CBD underscore Pure Med Slab.
[40:53.390 --> 40:55.470]  Sorry, I said it wrong the first time.
[40:55.470 --> 40:56.310]  I think you did it right,
[40:56.310 --> 40:57.510]  because I wrote it down properly.
[40:57.510 --> 40:58.350]  Okay, cool.
[40:58.470 --> 41:00.150]  Pure Med Slab.
[41:00.150 --> 41:00.990]  Okay, cool.
[41:00.990 --> 41:03.030]  Or it could be Pure Med Slab, whichever.
[41:03.030 --> 41:05.670]  Either way, I interpreted slabs, but you know, hey.
[41:05.670 --> 41:06.510]  Yeah, slabs.
[41:06.510 --> 41:07.510]  Either way.
[41:07.510 --> 41:10.870]  Yeah, they're coming out with everything
[41:10.870 --> 41:14.110]  from CBD coffee to 1000 milligram tinctures.
[41:14.110 --> 41:17.470]  So you can get a wide variety of what you might need.
[41:17.470 --> 41:21.230]  And like I said, dude, I'm not in it to just sit there
[41:21.230 --> 41:23.150]  and tell you that my product's gonna be the best
[41:23.150 --> 41:23.990]  or whatever.
[41:23.990 --> 41:26.190]  I don't actively put out products like that,
[41:26.190 --> 41:30.390]  but I can tell you there are a slew of companies
[41:30.390 --> 41:33.150]  that are legitimate that do.
[41:33.150 --> 41:34.670]  CBD International is another one.
[41:34.670 --> 41:36.910]  I personally do not, you know,
[41:36.910 --> 41:38.230]  I have nothing against them or anything.
[41:38.230 --> 41:41.030]  I just, you know, I know they're legitimate.
[41:41.030 --> 41:43.310]  They're out of California as well.
[41:43.310 --> 41:46.130]  Cannabinoids Heal is their Instagram handle.
[41:47.750 --> 41:49.590]  CBD Health Solutions is another one.
[41:49.590 --> 41:52.470]  They are a wholesaler, which also deal in
[41:52.990 --> 41:56.750]  cannabidrop tinctures and you know, whatnot.
[41:56.750 --> 41:59.470]  And yeah, like we can go on and on.
[41:59.470 --> 42:02.030]  They shop at a health food store in Colorado Springs
[42:02.030 --> 42:03.830]  and in their window, they have a sign
[42:03.830 --> 42:05.830]  that they sell CBD drops, of course,
[42:05.830 --> 42:07.070]  from the Stanley Brothers.
[42:07.070 --> 42:08.750]  Unfortunately, yeah.
[42:08.750 --> 42:10.830]  Is that product worth a shit in your opinion?
[42:10.830 --> 42:11.890]  Absolutely not.
[42:13.550 --> 42:15.190]  You know, actually I'll tell you what,
[42:15.190 --> 42:16.750]  I'm gonna go and pick some up
[42:16.750 --> 42:18.910]  and then I'm gonna have it tested through my friend Nate
[42:18.910 --> 42:20.590]  and then we should do another podcast.
[42:20.590 --> 42:21.550]  I'm all about that.
[42:21.670 --> 42:24.350]  Do you want me to help you pay for the cost of that bottle
[42:24.350 --> 42:25.630]  to do it on the podcast?
[42:25.630 --> 42:26.470]  Oh no, yeah, for sure.
[42:26.470 --> 42:27.590]  The cost of the testing or whatever.
[42:27.590 --> 42:30.910]  Oh absolutely, I'm sure Nate would love to do it for me.
[42:30.910 --> 42:32.310]  We'll definitely give him a shout out on the show.
[42:32.310 --> 42:34.030]  Oh of course, yeah, definitely.
[42:34.030 --> 42:38.110]  But yeah, I think that they're the biggest charlatans of all
[42:38.110 --> 42:40.390]  so you definitely have to be careful.
[42:40.390 --> 42:43.910]  Just, you know, a little bit of research goes a long way.
[42:43.910 --> 42:47.510]  You can also look into Halo Labs out of Arizona.
[42:47.510 --> 42:50.110]  They are big wholesalers as well
[42:50.150 --> 42:52.430]  and they work with other companies
[42:52.430 --> 42:53.950]  to completely re-band products
[42:53.950 --> 42:56.170]  under what they do at their lab in Arizona.
[42:57.950 --> 43:00.870]  So yeah, and like I said, I'm completely an open source.
[43:00.870 --> 43:04.050]  You know, Jeff can provide all that information
[43:04.050 --> 43:05.790]  for this show and you know.
[43:05.790 --> 43:07.470]  All this stuff will be in the show links,
[43:07.470 --> 43:08.870]  show notes so that you guys can have links
[43:08.870 --> 43:10.070]  to it on the Instagram.
[43:11.710 --> 43:12.550]  Oh go ahead.
[43:12.550 --> 43:13.950]  No, no, yeah, and it's good for you to be cautious,
[43:13.950 --> 43:16.150]  you know, and I'm sorry that you have to feel that way
[43:16.150 --> 43:18.070]  but I promise you there are companies out there
[43:18.110 --> 43:21.550]  that are, you know, legitimately, you know,
[43:21.550 --> 43:24.670]  pursuing the hemp products for what they truly are
[43:24.670 --> 43:27.790]  and not just trying to make a quick buck on, you know,
[43:28.910 --> 43:32.070]  you know, the unfortunate situation of our loved ones.
[43:32.070 --> 43:34.510]  Also check out King Cola on Instagram
[43:34.510 --> 43:37.070]  and Sansol CBD in Pueblo, Colorado.
[43:37.070 --> 43:38.030]  Yes.
[43:38.030 --> 43:40.670]  I definitely support their CBD project.
[43:40.670 --> 43:42.350]  They may be able to give you information.
[43:42.350 --> 43:44.750]  You may be able to acquire a product from them.
[43:44.750 --> 43:45.930]  I can't tell you what they can do.
[43:45.930 --> 43:46.950]  I'm just recommending them.
[43:46.950 --> 43:48.350]  I know they're very knowledgeable.
[43:48.350 --> 43:49.630]  Good hearted folks.
[43:49.630 --> 43:50.470]  Absolutely.
[43:50.470 --> 43:51.910]  Great folks.
[43:51.910 --> 43:53.110]  Something I should mention,
[43:53.110 --> 43:56.550]  if you're going to consume cannabis for your Parkinson's,
[43:56.550 --> 43:59.310]  don't only focus on the CBD for the healing.
[43:59.310 --> 44:01.610]  I would recommend something, a light sativa,
[44:01.610 --> 44:05.150]  like a jelly bean or a tangy because you need,
[44:05.150 --> 44:07.710]  I think the sativa, the THC and the sativa
[44:07.710 --> 44:10.590]  is good to help treatment but at the same time,
[44:10.590 --> 44:13.230]  that's gonna put you, the patient, in a better mood.
[44:13.230 --> 44:15.310]  It's gonna uplift your spirits a little bit.
[44:15.310 --> 44:16.630]  It's gonna make you a little more social.
[44:17.310 --> 44:18.390]  It's gonna put a smile on your face.
[44:18.390 --> 44:19.990]  That's a huge part of healing people,
[44:19.990 --> 44:22.310]  is keeping them happy and keeping a smile on their face.
[44:22.310 --> 44:23.150]  Absolutely.
[44:23.150 --> 44:24.270]  Your mood is everything,
[44:24.270 --> 44:26.790]  especially in recovery or in healing.
[44:27.990 --> 44:32.990]  So, strains that have known properties of uplifting mood
[44:33.350 --> 44:37.030]  and anti-anxiety.
[44:37.030 --> 44:38.070]  Jelly bean.
[44:38.070 --> 44:38.910]  Jelly bean.
[44:38.910 --> 44:40.710]  Space queen for me, dairy queen.
[44:40.710 --> 44:41.550]  Okay.
[44:41.550 --> 44:42.470]  A lot of the queens kind of do that.
[44:42.470 --> 44:43.910]  I don't find them as racy.
[44:43.950 --> 44:46.630]  I find them smooth, creamy, relaxing.
[44:46.630 --> 44:47.470]  All right.
[44:47.470 --> 44:48.790]  Vortex, on the other hand.
[44:48.790 --> 44:49.950]  Oh, no, yeah, that's a...
[44:49.950 --> 44:51.670]  Yeah, Vortex used to fuck me up.
[44:51.670 --> 44:52.990]  Yeah, that's like...
[44:52.990 --> 44:53.830]  Same breeder, though.
[44:53.830 --> 44:54.870]  It's all TGA subculture.
[44:54.870 --> 44:55.790]  Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[44:55.790 --> 44:58.230]  And they have a wide variety of things
[44:58.230 --> 44:59.670]  in that line of stuff.
[44:59.670 --> 45:01.510]  So, I think that's awesome that things like that
[45:01.510 --> 45:02.350]  are available.
[45:02.350 --> 45:03.910]  And you're right, not to just focus
[45:03.910 --> 45:05.630]  on the CBD-only side of things.
[45:05.630 --> 45:06.470]  Flow.
[45:06.470 --> 45:08.310]  The Colorado flow is a very uplifting,
[45:08.310 --> 45:09.590]  smiling morning bud.
[45:09.590 --> 45:11.030]  Absolutely.
[45:11.030 --> 45:12.430]  TGA Shores blueberry.
[45:12.430 --> 45:15.270]  It's not the most knock-you-down strain,
[45:15.270 --> 45:17.430]  but the smoke is incredibly enjoyable.
[45:17.430 --> 45:19.310]  Very medicinal as well.
[45:19.310 --> 45:21.750]  It could have good CBD and a very good head aroma,
[45:21.750 --> 45:22.590]  or a head high to it,
[45:22.590 --> 45:23.910]  and a nice blueberry aroma.
[45:23.910 --> 45:24.750]  Yeah, absolutely.
[45:24.750 --> 45:25.590]  Yeah.
[45:25.590 --> 45:26.430]  Shout out to DJ Short.
[45:26.430 --> 45:27.750]  He's been breeding for longer than most of us
[45:27.750 --> 45:29.350]  have even been thinking about cannabis.
[45:29.350 --> 45:32.390]  Yes, or had any inclination of wanting to work with it.
[45:32.390 --> 45:33.230]  True breeder.
[45:33.230 --> 45:34.070]  True, true breeder.
[45:34.070 --> 45:34.910]  Definitely.
[45:34.910 --> 45:37.470]  All right, so a second ago, you mentioned tincture.
[45:37.470 --> 45:38.790]  Yeah.
[45:38.790 --> 45:40.670]  We were talking about tincture and dosage
[45:40.670 --> 45:42.790]  on another episode.
[45:42.790 --> 45:46.710]  What do you recommend for dosage on a tincture?
[45:46.710 --> 45:49.110]  Say somebody has cancer,
[45:49.110 --> 45:53.230]  or maybe I don't even wanna diagnose anybody
[45:53.230 --> 45:54.230]  with another condition,
[45:54.230 --> 45:56.030]  but a sick person.
[45:56.030 --> 45:56.870]  We'll just go with cancer.
[45:56.870 --> 45:57.710]  It sounds decent.
[45:57.710 --> 45:58.530]  Yeah, let's go with cancer.
[45:58.530 --> 45:59.370]  It's common.
[45:59.370 --> 46:00.190]  Because it would be different.
[46:00.190 --> 46:02.950]  If it's more focused on the neurological condition,
[46:02.950 --> 46:04.670]  and it's a higher dose of CBD,
[46:04.670 --> 46:06.030]  and if it's THC only,
[46:06.030 --> 46:07.510]  or whether they're getting Delta-9,
[46:07.510 --> 46:09.950]  or all factors in how it's gonna go.
[46:10.510 --> 46:12.830]  So cancer, we're gonna go the other way around.
[46:14.270 --> 46:16.950]  Obviously, treatment,
[46:18.110 --> 46:19.990]  guidelines that we've followed is through,
[46:19.990 --> 46:21.190]  Rick Simpson, though,
[46:21.190 --> 46:23.150]  I don't use his extraction methods of,
[46:24.430 --> 46:26.310]  gram a day for 90 days.
[46:28.710 --> 46:30.250]  And doing that,
[46:31.710 --> 46:33.830]  when I say that THC high oil,
[46:33.830 --> 46:36.790]  and when I say a gram a day,
[46:36.790 --> 46:39.110]  it's really more like a thousand milligrams a day.
[46:39.110 --> 46:42.270]  And obviously, a gram
[46:43.230 --> 46:45.190]  isn't a thousand milligrams.
[46:45.190 --> 46:47.590]  So that's something that we,
[46:47.590 --> 46:48.990]  not enough gets focused on.
[46:48.990 --> 46:50.230]  So in the short of it,
[46:50.230 --> 46:51.190]  let's not say a gram a day.
[46:51.190 --> 46:53.690]  Let's say a thousand milligrams a day for 90 days.
[46:54.950 --> 46:57.430]  That's gonna make people feel like shit also.
[46:57.430 --> 46:58.270]  Yeah.
[47:00.670 --> 47:03.470]  They usually, the way you would start,
[47:03.470 --> 47:05.230]  because people have been consuming this oil raw
[47:05.230 --> 47:06.070]  for so long,
[47:06.070 --> 47:09.030]  they would start with little pea-sized bits,
[47:09.910 --> 47:10.910]  and that would fuck them up.
[47:10.910 --> 47:12.750]  And they'd kind of work their way up.
[47:14.670 --> 47:18.830]  Trying to work with different extraction methods
[47:18.830 --> 47:20.790]  and non-solvent techniques,
[47:20.790 --> 47:25.490]  and trying to gain the same uptake in the amount,
[47:25.490 --> 47:28.870]  but not feeling so sluggish,
[47:28.870 --> 47:30.350]  or more importantly,
[47:30.350 --> 47:34.430]  some of our bodies can't process that oil
[47:34.430 --> 47:36.550]  the way that we should, unfortunately.
[47:36.550 --> 47:39.390]  And it's better left as a topical for melanoma,
[47:39.390 --> 47:40.710]  so at that point,
[47:40.710 --> 47:42.670]  if our bodies can't process it,
[47:42.670 --> 47:46.350]  or if we have compromised digestive problems,
[47:46.350 --> 47:49.030]  whether it be Crohn's, colitis, whatever the case is,
[47:49.030 --> 47:50.070]  throw that shit out the door.
[47:50.070 --> 47:53.190]  You need something that isn't going to harm your gut,
[47:54.790 --> 47:59.790]  because of how the extraction method leaves it a little,
[48:00.690 --> 48:01.870]  it's a little harsh.
[48:01.870 --> 48:03.310]  Right, it's a little sludgy.
[48:03.310 --> 48:04.150]  Yeah, it's sludgy.
[48:04.150 --> 48:05.750]  There's a little burn to it,
[48:05.750 --> 48:07.390]  regardless of how clean it is.
[48:07.390 --> 48:09.750]  A lot of people aren't using grape ethanol.
[48:09.750 --> 48:11.370]  Most people are using Everclear,
[48:11.370 --> 48:13.230]  because that's what's available to them.
[48:13.230 --> 48:15.510]  So there's a lot of those things that come into account.
[48:15.510 --> 48:18.810]  So we try not to deal with that at all.
[48:20.310 --> 48:21.150]  You've seen me,
[48:21.150 --> 48:23.530]  I'm focusing more on the non-solvent part of that,
[48:23.530 --> 48:25.250]  and trying to focus,
[48:25.250 --> 48:26.990]  and de-winterize rosin,
[48:26.990 --> 48:28.630]  and start doing things of that sort,
[48:28.630 --> 48:31.070]  and seeing what we can do
[48:31.070 --> 48:34.070]  without having to use alcohol, or butane.
[48:34.070 --> 48:35.190]  Or butane, or solvents.
[48:36.030 --> 48:37.910]  And keep it organic.
[48:37.910 --> 48:42.910]  A friend of ours is starting a vineyard with some grapes,
[48:43.810 --> 48:47.990]  and we're going to be doing a little project.
[48:47.990 --> 48:50.750]  We'll be making our own grape ethanol.
[48:50.750 --> 48:51.590]  Neat.
[48:51.590 --> 48:56.150]  Yeah, so we're trying to make this all in Pueblo,
[48:56.150 --> 49:00.150]  nonetheless, so it's all Colorado organic
[49:00.150 --> 49:01.230]  at the end of the day.
[49:01.230 --> 49:03.190]  So the people that talk crap about Pueblo,
[49:03.190 --> 49:04.390]  we're doing some things here, you guys.
[49:04.550 --> 49:05.390]  We're killing it here.
[49:05.390 --> 49:07.110]  Oh yeah, I'm super happy to come down
[49:07.110 --> 49:08.030]  and be part of, you know,
[49:08.030 --> 49:09.550]  there's already a lot of great people,
[49:09.550 --> 49:12.750]  good caregivers, good breeders doing their things.
[49:12.750 --> 49:13.790]  So yeah, definitely.
[49:13.790 --> 49:15.150]  Pueblo is killing it.
[49:15.150 --> 49:17.270]  So for cancer, you'd basically recommend
[49:17.270 --> 49:20.710]  1,000 milligrams of THC per day
[49:20.710 --> 49:22.230]  to try to fight the cancer,
[49:22.230 --> 49:24.250]  and you do that for at least 90 days?
[49:24.250 --> 49:26.530]  Yeah, I mean, you know, I know that sounds intense,
[49:26.530 --> 49:28.150]  and so I'll say this.
[49:29.070 --> 49:30.290]  You know, if it's for our loved ones,
[49:30.290 --> 49:31.470]  or whatever the case is,
[49:31.470 --> 49:35.510]  taking it via suppository will bypass
[49:35.510 --> 49:37.870]  that feeling of you eating, you know,
[49:37.870 --> 49:40.150]  a gram plus a day.
[49:40.150 --> 49:42.890]  Our bodies will still take it and absorb it,
[49:42.890 --> 49:45.750]  and we'll get all the cancer-killing qualities
[49:45.750 --> 49:49.030]  of the THC without that effect
[49:49.030 --> 49:51.230]  of it going through our digestive system
[49:51.230 --> 49:52.990]  and then into our bloodstream, you know?
[49:52.990 --> 49:54.430]  You'll probably get more of it.
[49:54.430 --> 49:57.310]  Yeah, and you would get it absorbed quicker,
[49:57.310 --> 49:59.590]  you know, without, it's pretty amazing
[49:59.590 --> 50:00.930]  how that works, you know?
[50:01.370 --> 50:02.210]  And we're not talking about just putting
[50:02.210 --> 50:04.290]  some hash or buds in your butt,
[50:04.290 --> 50:05.130]  you guys are really real.
[50:05.130 --> 50:05.950]  No, absolutely not.
[50:05.950 --> 50:06.790]  It's gotta be activated.
[50:06.790 --> 50:08.010]  It's probably some hash oil
[50:08.010 --> 50:10.010]  with some coconut oil inside of a pill.
[50:10.010 --> 50:11.050]  Yeah, a special pill,
[50:11.050 --> 50:12.730]  and then you have to obviously know
[50:12.730 --> 50:14.730]  where you're placing it so that it goes
[50:14.730 --> 50:17.130]  into your tract and so on and so forth,
[50:17.130 --> 50:19.010]  and I don't wanna get too specific,
[50:19.010 --> 50:21.690]  but you know, if you guys are curious about that,
[50:21.690 --> 50:23.930]  again, you know, ask me.
[50:23.930 --> 50:25.510]  I'm more than happy to go into that.
[50:25.510 --> 50:29.450]  If you wanna do an episode on gastrointestinal,
[50:29.450 --> 50:32.210]  you know, side effects and things with CBD,
[50:32.210 --> 50:33.750]  we can totally do that, but.
[50:34.970 --> 50:36.890]  This guy lives like 15 minutes away from me now,
[50:36.890 --> 50:38.810]  you guys, so he will be on the show a lot.
[50:38.810 --> 50:40.690]  Send me all of your CBD questions.
[50:40.690 --> 50:41.570]  Yeah, definitely.
[50:41.570 --> 50:43.290]  I'm more than happy to, you know,
[50:43.290 --> 50:45.010]  help in any way I can.
[50:45.010 --> 50:48.110]  But yeah, at least 1,000 milligrams a day.
[50:48.110 --> 50:50.330]  Obviously, a lot of people don't have
[50:50.330 --> 50:51.730]  that advantage of knowing someone
[50:51.730 --> 50:53.790]  who can make the suppositories.
[50:54.630 --> 50:56.610]  Maybe that's something I can work on in the future
[50:56.610 --> 50:59.570]  and try to just, you know, create, you know,
[50:59.570 --> 51:01.370]  put something out there as a little, you know,
[51:01.370 --> 51:03.490]  formula for people to follow.
[51:03.490 --> 51:07.570]  But in the meanwhile, if you can find,
[51:07.570 --> 51:09.010]  on the same level, there are people
[51:09.010 --> 51:11.570]  who make 10,000 milligram tinctures
[51:11.570 --> 51:15.290]  where every dropper is like 400 milligrams, you know?
[51:15.290 --> 51:17.530]  If you happen to be in Colorado or a medical state,
[51:17.530 --> 51:19.210]  it's gonna be much easier to find these.
[51:19.210 --> 51:24.210]  If not, again, you know, trying to find the material
[51:24.970 --> 51:29.970]  and create that, you know, that medicine is essential.
[51:30.090 --> 51:33.610]  You know, you're gonna have to basically
[51:33.610 --> 51:34.890]  get your math right.
[51:34.890 --> 51:36.210]  And it's just so difficult.
[51:36.210 --> 51:38.410]  It breaks my heart just speaking, you know,
[51:38.410 --> 51:39.570]  about that to other people,
[51:39.570 --> 51:40.970]  knowing that they're in states
[51:40.970 --> 51:42.970]  where they can't get their oil tested,
[51:42.970 --> 51:44.170]  so they can't get the math right
[51:44.170 --> 51:47.010]  on what the dosage really is.
[51:47.010 --> 51:47.850]  Exactly.
[51:47.850 --> 51:49.330]  And so there's a guessing game
[51:49.330 --> 51:51.630]  of if they're lucky enough to have the material
[51:51.630 --> 51:53.730]  to make the oil the way that they need to,
[51:54.250 --> 51:55.090]  how the fuck are they gonna dose it?
[51:55.090 --> 51:57.810]  Or how the fuck are they gonna accurately, like,
[51:57.810 --> 52:02.070]  it just upsets me, you know, for them as patients.
[52:02.070 --> 52:05.850]  But nevertheless, you know,
[52:05.850 --> 52:07.730]  where there's the will, there's a way, you know?
[52:07.730 --> 52:10.410]  And lives are more important than laws, in my opinion.
[52:11.290 --> 52:13.090]  Hashtag lives over laws.
[52:13.090 --> 52:14.050]  Yep.
[52:14.050 --> 52:16.610]  So people, you know, people listening
[52:16.610 --> 52:19.330]  that are, you know, curious about that, you know,
[52:19.330 --> 52:21.930]  I don't support anything
[52:21.930 --> 52:25.290]  that would ever jeopardize your freedom,
[52:25.290 --> 52:29.210]  but if you're trying to help someone you love,
[52:29.210 --> 52:32.050]  then I will happily share whatever information I can,
[52:32.050 --> 52:32.890]  you know?
[52:32.890 --> 52:33.770]  Fox is here to teach.
[52:33.770 --> 52:35.970]  He will sit down with each and every one of you
[52:35.970 --> 52:38.690]  and teach you what he knows, if that's what's needed.
[52:38.690 --> 52:39.530]  Pretty much.
[52:39.530 --> 52:42.090]  So we talked about somebody with cancer.
[52:42.090 --> 52:43.570]  What about if you've just got,
[52:43.570 --> 52:45.050]  like, I've got some knee inflammation.
[52:45.050 --> 52:45.890]  I work hard.
[52:45.890 --> 52:47.010]  My body, you know, I'm a puss.
[52:47.010 --> 52:47.850]  I got some aches and pains.
[52:47.850 --> 52:48.690]  You're kind of a tall dude, you know?
[52:49.090 --> 52:50.650]  You put it on your joints.
[52:50.650 --> 52:51.690]  I get the lower back pain
[52:51.690 --> 52:53.570]  and the knee pain going on at this age.
[52:53.570 --> 52:55.810]  What would you recommend, tincture-wise,
[52:55.810 --> 52:57.410]  for a guy in my condition?
[52:59.090 --> 53:01.770]  Honestly, like, one-to-ones are the way to get,
[53:01.770 --> 53:03.770]  like, one-to-ones for when you get off of work
[53:03.770 --> 53:07.770]  and some high CBD, low THC, you know,
[53:07.770 --> 53:09.770]  if you need to take it throughout the day, you know?
[53:09.770 --> 53:13.330]  It'll prevent any inflammation
[53:13.330 --> 53:14.610]  if it's towards the end of the day.
[53:14.610 --> 53:17.130]  It'll help bring any down that you have.
[53:17.970 --> 53:20.530]  It'll help relax your muscles.
[53:20.530 --> 53:21.890]  So if you're stiff, you know,
[53:21.890 --> 53:25.170]  you won't have that stiffness.
[53:25.170 --> 53:27.210]  I think CBD is a great way to start it
[53:27.210 --> 53:29.130]  in the morning, especially.
[53:29.130 --> 53:31.570]  Do you juice or do you, you know, are you-
[53:31.570 --> 53:34.090]  I eat, like, crap lately, to tell you the honest truth.
[53:34.090 --> 53:35.690]  I'm a vegetarian that eats like crap.
[53:35.690 --> 53:36.770]  That's okay.
[53:36.770 --> 53:39.610]  It's why you're my favorite vegetarian.
[53:39.610 --> 53:41.610]  I'm not sure what that means, but okay.
[53:41.610 --> 53:43.850]  I'm not vegan, dude.
[53:43.850 --> 53:44.690]  I'm not that guy.
[53:44.690 --> 53:45.530]  Exactly.
[53:45.530 --> 53:46.490]  I'm not the vegan guy.
[53:46.810 --> 53:48.410]  That's, yeah, see, that's good.
[53:49.930 --> 53:50.770]  But yeah.
[53:53.490 --> 53:55.090]  Shoot, I totally forgot what I was saying.
[53:55.090 --> 53:55.930]  That's all right.
[53:55.930 --> 53:57.130]  I can reroute us.
[53:57.130 --> 54:00.130]  Do you recommend utilizing Reclaim
[54:00.130 --> 54:01.850]  in tincture or edible form?
[54:01.850 --> 54:03.770]  Okay, so yeah, let's be honest.
[54:03.770 --> 54:05.810]  You know, if you, I would suggest
[54:05.810 --> 54:08.690]  if you're, you know, medicating or whatever,
[54:08.690 --> 54:10.890]  drop-downs are essential for collecting Reclaim
[54:10.890 --> 54:13.970]  because you don't want to collect some Reclaim
[54:13.970 --> 54:16.010]  that's had water through it and have to,
[54:16.450 --> 54:17.450]  it's just a whole process.
[54:17.450 --> 54:18.410]  You don't want that humidity.
[54:18.410 --> 54:20.650]  But anyways, yes.
[54:20.650 --> 54:21.970]  It's been proven that, you know,
[54:21.970 --> 54:25.850]  I've seen Reclaim test high as 63%, you know, THC.
[54:25.850 --> 54:27.490]  So, and that's activated oil.
[54:27.490 --> 54:29.530]  So, I mean, it's not fully activated,
[54:29.530 --> 54:32.050]  but at that point, it pretty, you know,
[54:32.050 --> 54:35.090]  recollecting it and putting into a container
[54:35.090 --> 54:38.330]  and then, you know, activating it for a bit longer
[54:38.330 --> 54:41.770]  will really, I mean, it's great food grade, you know.
[54:41.770 --> 54:42.690]  Clean it up properly.
[54:42.690 --> 54:44.090]  Make sure all the moisture's out of it.
[54:44.090 --> 54:48.450]  You know, add your oil carrier, you know,
[54:48.450 --> 54:50.650]  your fat carrier, whatever you want to call it.
[54:50.650 --> 54:53.250]  And you're good to go on your edibles, you know,
[54:53.250 --> 54:54.810]  or your capsules for that matter.
[54:54.810 --> 54:56.210]  You keep talking about activating.
[54:56.210 --> 54:59.450]  Can you teach us about decarboxylation and activation?
[54:59.450 --> 55:02.550]  Okay, so decarboxylation, decarbing your oil.
[55:04.010 --> 55:07.250]  So, depending on whether you're going for CBD,
[55:07.250 --> 55:08.370]  damn, that is gonna be a piss.
[55:08.370 --> 55:10.610]  I was supposed to have this convo with her like a month ago.
[55:10.610 --> 55:11.450]  All right.
[55:12.050 --> 55:16.970]  So, when you're decarbing for certain oils,
[55:16.970 --> 55:19.690]  you can decarb for more sedative oil, you know,
[55:19.690 --> 55:24.450]  like you can convert CBD or THC oil into CBN
[55:24.450 --> 55:27.090]  and it's just like, it's beyond sedative.
[55:27.090 --> 55:29.210]  I mean, it's beyond Indica Plus, you know,
[55:29.210 --> 55:31.090]  so it's like sleepy time for sure.
[55:31.090 --> 55:31.930]  Okay.
[55:31.930 --> 55:36.410]  Like sleepy time tea times two, you know, which is great.
[55:36.410 --> 55:39.570]  Or, you know, you can do shorter decarb times
[55:39.570 --> 55:43.650]  at different temperatures to stay within that,
[55:43.650 --> 55:45.570]  not break that acid barrier.
[55:45.570 --> 55:48.370]  So, when you decarboxylate something,
[55:48.370 --> 55:52.250]  there's an oil decarboxylic acid,
[55:52.250 --> 55:54.970]  which accounts for a certain percentage.
[55:54.970 --> 55:57.530]  So, when you do that, you're gonna obtain a loss.
[55:57.530 --> 55:59.930]  It's like minuscule, you're not gonna notice it,
[55:59.930 --> 56:01.370]  but you need to know, like, you know,
[56:01.370 --> 56:05.050]  when you see the bubbles coming up out of your oil and stuff,
[56:05.050 --> 56:09.210]  that's decarboxylic acid, you know, coming up and, you know,
[56:09.730 --> 56:12.890]  leaving, you know, the oil so that you, you know,
[56:12.890 --> 56:17.890]  a lot of people assume that it's a solvent or something,
[56:18.050 --> 56:19.050]  you know, whatever it is.
[56:19.050 --> 56:21.330]  But if you're starting with a clean oil, that's not the case.
[56:21.330 --> 56:23.090]  If you've already dabbed it, there's no solvent left.
[56:23.090 --> 56:24.050]  Yeah, exactly.
[56:24.050 --> 56:27.370]  Or, you know, if, you know, depending on the situation.
[56:27.370 --> 56:30.490]  And then I'm actually gonna start decarboxylating
[56:30.490 --> 56:31.930]  all the solventless stuff.
[56:31.930 --> 56:33.850]  So, I've never really done a lot of that
[56:33.850 --> 56:37.090]  because I've, you know, focused on butane extractions mostly
[56:37.090 --> 56:39.370]  or isolate concentrates.
[56:39.370 --> 56:40.850]  So, it'll be interesting to see.
[56:40.850 --> 56:42.890]  I don't think it should be too different with the rosin,
[56:42.890 --> 56:45.090]  but yeah, so.
[56:45.090 --> 56:46.090]  Wouldn't you think the rosin
[56:46.090 --> 56:47.970]  is kind of already activated a little
[56:47.970 --> 56:49.490]  since it's been through so much heat?
[56:49.490 --> 56:50.330]  See, that's the thing.
[56:50.330 --> 56:53.290]  I'm taking, you know, half grams
[56:53.290 --> 56:54.730]  from all these different presses
[56:54.730 --> 56:56.390]  and I wanna get them tested for that reason.
[56:56.390 --> 56:57.970]  But from what I've seen,
[56:57.970 --> 57:00.450]  even from like soil grown stuff and other people,
[57:00.450 --> 57:04.290]  I haven't seen, it's not fully activated.
[57:04.290 --> 57:06.530]  Even the chips come in at like that,
[57:07.490 --> 57:11.770]  the Reclaim, the rosin chips are coming in at like 30 to 50%.
[57:11.770 --> 57:15.490]  You know, you can do an iso soak or even better.
[57:15.490 --> 57:18.330]  What I would do personally, if you guys do the rosin,
[57:18.330 --> 57:19.890]  you guys are big collectors,
[57:19.890 --> 57:22.130]  is do canna butter with your rosin chips.
[57:22.130 --> 57:22.970]  Wow.
[57:22.970 --> 57:24.010]  You know, because that's, you're gonna,
[57:24.010 --> 57:26.730]  you can break it all down almost like a mulch
[57:26.730 --> 57:29.570]  and just, you know, double up on your cheesecloth
[57:29.570 --> 57:32.850]  when you're filtering, you know, if you're OCD like me.
[57:32.850 --> 57:35.530]  And it'll make some great butter for edibles,
[57:35.530 --> 57:38.890]  like hands down, you know, some real good body high.
[57:38.890 --> 57:39.850]  Use it all.
[57:39.850 --> 57:40.690]  No, absolutely.
[57:40.690 --> 57:42.590]  I'm a total fan of,
[57:43.930 --> 57:47.210]  and advocate of using the whole plant.
[57:47.210 --> 57:49.130]  That's why we're actually growing some of them
[57:49.130 --> 57:52.410]  with just water, straight water, no neats,
[57:52.410 --> 57:56.130]  so that we can juice those couple of plants, you know?
[57:56.130 --> 57:58.610]  And then we can say like no animal byproduct, nothing.
[57:58.610 --> 57:59.450]  I mean, just-
[57:59.450 --> 58:00.270]  Yeah, don't spray them with anything.
[58:00.270 --> 58:01.370]  Nothing, just straight RO, bro.
[58:01.370 --> 58:02.210]  Yeah.
[58:03.130 --> 58:04.430]  We're excited about that.
[58:05.730 --> 58:07.970]  I'm going to pull something up
[58:07.970 --> 58:11.410]  so that we can get a little specific
[58:11.410 --> 58:12.930]  with the decarboxylation.
[58:12.930 --> 58:14.130]  I like it.
[58:14.130 --> 58:15.490]  We're gonna learn a whole bunch of stuff here, guys.
[58:15.490 --> 58:16.530]  Be patient while he searches.
[58:16.530 --> 58:19.070]  He's got a little bit of information to pull up for us.
[58:19.070 --> 58:20.570]  So you guys can use your reclaim.
[58:20.570 --> 58:22.970]  And he mentioned using a dropdown.
[58:22.970 --> 58:25.450]  We often forget that some of our friends are not dabbers
[58:25.450 --> 58:26.330]  and they don't dab daily,
[58:26.330 --> 58:27.330]  and they might be in other states
[58:27.330 --> 58:28.610]  where the toilet's flushed the wrong way
[58:28.610 --> 58:30.170]  and the weed grows upside down.
[58:31.050 --> 58:31.890]  Fucking Aussies.
[58:32.570 --> 58:33.410]  Yeah, our Australian friends.
[58:33.410 --> 58:34.250]  I might've said states too,
[58:34.250 --> 58:35.070]  and he's in another country.
[58:35.070 --> 58:36.410]  That's not a state.
[58:36.410 --> 58:37.930]  I found out Australia had states.
[58:37.930 --> 58:40.170]  Like I stupidly thought it was just Australia
[58:40.170 --> 58:42.690]  and all of Australia, and there's like no parts of.
[58:42.690 --> 58:44.450]  He didn't think about Sydney and Melbourne.
[58:44.450 --> 58:46.650]  Yeah, that's just the dumb of American.
[58:46.650 --> 58:47.490]  No.
[58:47.490 --> 58:48.850]  So a dropdown, you guys.
[58:48.850 --> 58:50.170]  A dropdown will go on your,
[58:50.170 --> 58:52.490]  normally where the nail would go,
[58:52.490 --> 58:53.490]  you put a dropdown in there.
[58:53.490 --> 58:56.330]  It's a piece of glass that comes out
[58:56.330 --> 58:59.130]  where the nail would go, and it angles down.
[58:59.130 --> 59:01.170]  And then it angles back up to where your nail
[59:01.170 --> 59:02.490]  or your e-nail could go on it,
[59:02.490 --> 59:04.210]  and it just puts the nail a couple of inches
[59:04.210 --> 59:05.650]  away from your face,
[59:05.650 --> 59:08.470]  and it also makes a nice place to catch the reclaim oil
[59:08.470 --> 59:10.690]  so that it doesn't end up in your rig water.
[59:10.690 --> 59:11.730]  So that's what a dropdown is
[59:11.730 --> 59:14.250]  when he was talking about a dropdown earlier.
[59:14.250 --> 59:16.610]  Shout out to my friend Rasta7Australia.
[59:16.610 --> 59:17.450]  Thanks for the support.
[59:17.450 --> 59:19.830]  It was good seeing you on Facebook Live.
[59:20.670 --> 59:23.290]  Fox is diligently searching for this information here.
[59:23.290 --> 59:24.850]  Okay.
[59:24.850 --> 59:29.850]  So we're gonna talk TAT first.
[59:29.890 --> 59:34.890]  So boiling point for TAT would be 315 degrees Fahrenheit,
[59:36.850 --> 59:38.810]  and that's what that would start to boil off.
[59:38.810 --> 59:39.650]  Okay.
[59:39.650 --> 59:40.490]  So-
[59:40.490 --> 59:41.890]  And that's when it starts to convert.
[59:41.890 --> 59:45.630]  Yes, and that will convert it to,
[59:46.450 --> 59:48.450]  if there's any CBD to convert to,
[59:48.450 --> 59:49.850]  that's what it would convert.
[59:49.850 --> 59:51.410]  But let's go back to the TAT.
[59:51.410 --> 59:55.370]  So you would wanna be between 290
[59:55.370 --> 59:57.650]  and 310 degrees Fahrenheit.
[59:58.490 --> 01:00:00.090]  290 and 310.
[01:00:00.090 --> 01:00:05.090]  Yeah, because that's between the CBCA and THC barrier.
[01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:09.610]  CBCA is another compound we can,
[01:00:09.610 --> 01:00:12.290]  that's a whole nother three-hour conversation.
[01:00:12.290 --> 01:00:13.330]  But we can get into that some-
[01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:14.170]  We'll have that one.
[01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:15.010]  Yeah, no, totally.
[01:00:15.010 --> 01:00:15.850]  That's fun.
[01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:17.090]  That's just dark talk for me.
[01:00:17.090 --> 01:00:18.930]  But anyways, getting back to that.
[01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:21.090]  So that will activate your Delta 9,
[01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.690]  which is obviously your,
[01:00:22.690 --> 01:00:24.330]  a lot of people don't know,
[01:00:24.330 --> 01:00:27.330]  it's also an anti-inflammatory appetite stimulant,
[01:00:28.010 --> 01:00:31.170]  anti-emetic, anti-prophylactic, and antioxidant
[01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.050]  on top of all the wonderful things
[01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:34.930]  that it does with cancer.
[01:00:38.050 --> 01:00:39.250]  That being said,
[01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.450]  depending on how long you go on the D-carb,
[01:00:43.450 --> 01:00:46.610]  you can burn your oil.
[01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.690]  So you have to be careful of that,
[01:00:49.690 --> 01:00:51.290]  going for the longer D-carbs.
[01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:56.290]  But I have D-carb oils for three hours, six hours.
[01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.690]  Eight hours, just to get to see
[01:00:59.690 --> 01:01:02.290]  where the sedative effect comes out,
[01:01:02.290 --> 01:01:06.610]  where the burnout, where am I burning things out?
[01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:14.050]  You can D-carb the oil for, let's say, 90 minutes.
[01:01:14.050 --> 01:01:16.050]  But honestly, I would say 180 minutes
[01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.330]  is a good starting point.
[01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:20.490]  I really like to look at it every,
[01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.450]  ah, shit, every 45 to 60 minutes
[01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:25.770]  to see how it's doing.
[01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:28.730]  Because every oil that you start with is different.
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.370]  It's not gonna be my oil you're using.
[01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:31.690]  I'm not gonna be using your oil.
[01:01:31.690 --> 01:01:36.050]  So I'll tell you these times and mindsets,
[01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:38.330]  but just keep in mind and keep an eye on everything.
[01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:42.170]  And once all the D-carboxylic acid,
[01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:43.290]  I hope I'm saying that right,
[01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.250]  sorry if I'm not a little medicated,
[01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:50.010]  comes out of the oil and what you're left with
[01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:55.010]  is this D-carbed goodness that is fully activated
[01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.930]  and depending on what temperature points
[01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:00.970]  that you're hitting, you're either activating for CBD,
[01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:05.210]  you're activating for terpene-rich activated oil.
[01:02:07.290 --> 01:02:08.410]  It all depends.
[01:02:08.410 --> 01:02:10.530]  It's like you can just play around with your temperatures
[01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:12.290]  and have a completely different product
[01:02:12.290 --> 01:02:13.570]  depending on what you do.
[01:02:13.570 --> 01:02:15.370]  How is one, so if I had some,
[01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.810]  if I had my drop-down, I had some Reclaim
[01:02:17.810 --> 01:02:19.490]  and I collected a substantial amount,
[01:02:19.490 --> 01:02:22.850]  now I want to activate it, to D-carb it,
[01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:24.410]  and I wanna get it to this temperature,
[01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.250]  how do I do that?
[01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:27.330]  Do I just put it in a Pyrex dish
[01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:28.810]  and maybe throw it in the oven?
[01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.130]  Is there a tech to this?
[01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:31.890]  Or is it something you wanna share?
[01:02:31.890 --> 01:02:34.010]  Okay, to make it really easy,
[01:02:34.010 --> 01:02:37.170]  and just like, you can call it low-tech or whatever,
[01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:41.370]  so get yourself to Target or Walmart or whatever you're,
[01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:42.690]  you know, I don't care who you go to,
[01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:45.090]  but any place that sells Pyrex,
[01:02:45.090 --> 01:02:47.050]  and try to find the small, like,
[01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:50.330]  shit, I don't even know what kind of little bowl it is,
[01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:54.770]  like a little Pyrex,
[01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:57.290]  like a little salsa bowl?
[01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:00.010]  Yeah, yeah, like a little pampered chef little container.
[01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.490]  Yeah, exactly, you know,
[01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.090]  they'll sell them in a few different sizes,
[01:03:03.090 --> 01:03:04.610]  try to get a small one if you can,
[01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:06.770]  because, you know, it's just to make it easier,
[01:03:06.770 --> 01:03:10.370]  and then you can take your drop-down
[01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.010]  when it's full or gunked up,
[01:03:12.010 --> 01:03:13.930]  and take a torch to it,
[01:03:13.930 --> 01:03:16.410]  and when I mean that, very, you know,
[01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.770]  gently just torch it a little bit
[01:03:18.770 --> 01:03:20.410]  until you can see the oil moving,
[01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:24.810]  excuse me, and then you can pour all the oil
[01:03:25.370 --> 01:03:28.250]  into the little ramekin cup or whatever you want to call it.
[01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.090]  There you go, that's the word we were both looking for.
[01:03:29.090 --> 01:03:32.530]  Yeah, yeah, I think so, yeah, the Pyrex ramekin,
[01:03:32.530 --> 01:03:34.850]  and yeah, after that, you know,
[01:03:34.850 --> 01:03:37.410]  after you've got that all poured in, you know,
[01:03:37.410 --> 01:03:39.610]  be very careful not to, you know,
[01:03:39.610 --> 01:03:41.810]  crack your drop-down, you know?
[01:03:41.810 --> 01:03:42.930]  There's easier ways to do it,
[01:03:42.930 --> 01:03:45.930]  you can put the drop-down in the oven
[01:03:45.930 --> 01:03:49.650]  and let it get, you know, warm and pour it out or whatever,
[01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:50.970]  but- Kids don't try this at home.
[01:03:50.970 --> 01:03:53.290]  Yeah, yeah, this way just kind of works
[01:03:53.290 --> 01:03:54.490]  a little bit easier, you know,
[01:03:55.170 --> 01:03:56.250]  just taking a light little flame to it,
[01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.570]  watching the oil move, it'll all dump out,
[01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:01.970]  and then you can start getting to work on that.
[01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.370]  Yeah, after you've decarbed it,
[01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:07.250]  you can, you know, add your carrot oil.
[01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:08.650]  I always like to-
[01:04:08.650 --> 01:04:11.730]  So once we've got it into the petri, or the ramekin,
[01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:12.570]  Yeah.
[01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:13.730]  Now what do we do with it?
[01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:15.090]  Okay, now you've got it in there,
[01:04:15.090 --> 01:04:18.450]  you set your temperature depending on what you need.
[01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:21.130]  You can actually, if you guys want to learn something,
[01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:24.970]  you can Google cannabis activation chart,
[01:04:24.970 --> 01:04:29.050]  and you'll see a bunch of different pictures and graphs,
[01:04:29.050 --> 01:04:32.250]  and it'll kind of give you an idea of, you know,
[01:04:32.250 --> 01:04:33.130]  where you want to go.
[01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:34.850]  Most people, like I said, are just activating,
[01:04:34.850 --> 01:04:36.690]  you know, for the THC, and that's great.
[01:04:36.690 --> 01:04:39.010]  So, you know, like I said,
[01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:43.050]  so let's say at an even 300, 180 minutes, you know-
[01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:44.130]  Just pop it in the oven?
[01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:45.210]  Yeah, pop it in the oven.
[01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.450]  Okay.
[01:04:46.450 --> 01:04:47.690]  Let's do its thing.
[01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:50.530]  Some people like to add the carrot oil
[01:04:50.890 --> 01:04:52.050]  before they decarb it.
[01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.490]  I like to decarb the oil completely,
[01:04:55.490 --> 01:04:57.570]  and then add my carrier oil to it, you know,
[01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:59.810]  whether it's going to be avocado, coconut,
[01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:03.170]  grapeseed, lynch, you know, whatever.
[01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:06.090]  Grapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, whatever.
[01:05:06.090 --> 01:05:08.810]  There's a bunch, like each, depending on the patient,
[01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.050]  whatever the hell they're allergic to,
[01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:13.370]  you'll be like, all right, there's something, thankfully.
[01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.210]  Guaranteed a fat that your body can take.
[01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.570]  Yeah, so needless to say, you know,
[01:05:18.570 --> 01:05:20.170]  there's ways around whatever.
[01:05:20.770 --> 01:05:22.810]  But yeah, so you put it in the oven, you know,
[01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:26.090]  you set your time, you check on it.
[01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:29.570]  Once it's ready, you know, you add,
[01:05:29.570 --> 01:05:32.490]  oh, and let's back up a little bit.
[01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:35.010]  Before you put it in the oven, weigh it out.
[01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:38.130]  Know how much that you're working with.
[01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:39.770]  That makes it super easy.
[01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.130]  So you're working with seven grams,
[01:05:42.130 --> 01:05:43.970]  or three grams, or whatever.
[01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:46.050]  You know how much coconut oil you're going to put in.
[01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:47.250]  You want to weigh that out too.
[01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:49.170]  That will make it a lot easier.
[01:05:50.010 --> 01:05:53.690]  Have a weight-specific ratio that you can work with.
[01:05:53.690 --> 01:05:55.410]  Sometimes I go really low, you know,
[01:05:55.410 --> 01:05:59.330]  like one gram to seven grams, you know, or less.
[01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:03.650]  You know, just to kind of get it to this wonderful,
[01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:05.170]  you know, all for consistency,
[01:06:05.170 --> 01:06:07.170]  depending on what we're doing, you know?
[01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:13.090]  That being said, once that's added,
[01:06:13.090 --> 01:06:15.450]  once you have your numbers and everything's weighed,
[01:06:15.450 --> 01:06:17.450]  do everything we talked about.
[01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:21.010]  Set it in your Petri dish, or your ramekin cup.
[01:06:21.010 --> 01:06:22.290]  Put it in the oven.
[01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.410]  De-carb it for X amount of time.
[01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:26.010]  Add your oil.
[01:06:26.010 --> 01:06:29.210]  Make sure that, you know, it's bonded,
[01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.530]  that it's not separated.
[01:06:30.530 --> 01:06:32.890]  You can put it back in the oven for just a little while.
[01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:36.290]  And then, you know, follow the recipe
[01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:37.850]  of whatever you're trying to do.
[01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:39.450]  Capsules.
[01:06:39.450 --> 01:06:40.930]  If you're trying to, you know, keep the oil,
[01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:42.930]  you can pull it in a syringe, you know,
[01:06:42.930 --> 01:06:46.610]  and keep it, you know, keep it ready for until you need it.
[01:06:46.650 --> 01:06:48.930]  Or, you know, whatever you're trying to do.
[01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:49.770]  Nice.
[01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:51.170]  Those syringes are sketchy looking.
[01:06:51.170 --> 01:06:52.010]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:52.010 --> 01:06:53.010]  I'm not a fan of them.
[01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:53.850]  Yeah.
[01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.570]  But sometimes that's the best way that you can apply it
[01:06:55.570 --> 01:06:56.410]  to whatever you're doing.
[01:06:56.410 --> 01:06:59.250]  Yeah, or, you know, the best way to collect it in,
[01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:01.010]  excuse me, in large amounts.
[01:07:01.010 --> 01:07:03.410]  You are a wealth of CBD knowledge, my friend.
[01:07:03.410 --> 01:07:04.370]  Yeah.
[01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:06.690]  People don't, I guess so.
[01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.370]  No, I love it.
[01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:10.370]  I love that somebody, I'm a weed nerd.
[01:07:10.370 --> 01:07:11.450]  I love growing cannabis.
[01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:12.650]  I love knowing about breeding,
[01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:14.690]  and strains, and strain selection.
[01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:15.650]  I love that stuff.
[01:07:15.650 --> 01:07:18.290]  I love that somebody is focused in on the cannabinoids,
[01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.450]  and the making specific products for people.
[01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:21.290]  That's really rad.
[01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:22.130]  Thank you.
[01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:22.970]  I commend you for that.
[01:07:22.970 --> 01:07:23.810]  That's a fat dab.
[01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:25.010]  I'm kind of jealous right now.
[01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:26.370]  So we've been going for just about an hour.
[01:07:26.370 --> 01:07:27.970]  I'm gonna ask you one more question,
[01:07:27.970 --> 01:07:29.850]  and then we're gonna have to wrap up this show for the night.
[01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:31.570]  It's almost midnight here in Colorado.
[01:07:31.570 --> 01:07:32.930]  No doubt.
[01:07:32.930 --> 01:07:34.090]  Fox will be back, you guys.
[01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:35.610]  He lives close, like I said.
[01:07:35.610 --> 01:07:38.570]  And we get along real well, and he shows up with Terps.
[01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:41.250]  So he'll be back, and he brings this really cool rig.
[01:07:42.370 --> 01:07:43.410]  So somebody sent me an email.
[01:07:43.410 --> 01:07:44.770]  They're pregnant.
[01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:45.890]  They're gonna have a baby.
[01:07:45.890 --> 01:07:48.050]  And they wanted to know how I feel,
[01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:51.090]  and what information I had on cannabis and pregnancy.
[01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:54.090]  And honestly, as a stoner dude,
[01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:55.370]  I really haven't thought too much
[01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:56.410]  about cannabis and pregnancy.
[01:07:56.410 --> 01:07:59.170]  I don't feel that that's a lot of my business.
[01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:00.970]  I shouldn't be preaching anything about that.
[01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:02.650]  But do you have an opinion on it?
[01:08:02.650 --> 01:08:03.970]  Yeah, I do.
[01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:07.370]  And first of all, let me start by saying,
[01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:09.530]  you know, a woman's body is her own fucking business.
[01:08:09.530 --> 01:08:10.370]  Absolutely.
[01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:12.970]  I'm not one to say shit.
[01:08:13.850 --> 01:08:15.330]  But I'll tell you my experience with it.
[01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:19.410]  So my ex-wife, the mother of my child,
[01:08:19.410 --> 01:08:20.970]  had a horrible morning sickness.
[01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:22.370]  Like, holy shit, dude.
[01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:23.930]  Just, she wasn't able to work.
[01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:25.410]  She wasn't able to work at her job.
[01:08:25.410 --> 01:08:28.090]  You know, she was a banker at the time.
[01:08:28.090 --> 01:08:29.930]  It was really affecting her.
[01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:32.970]  What helped, you know, was some cannabis in the morning.
[01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:35.810]  You know, this is, we weren't, this is,
[01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:40.250]  this is back, way back, eight, nine years ago.
[01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:41.650]  You know, almost 10 years ago.
[01:08:41.650 --> 01:08:45.170]  So people weren't up on the clean oil game
[01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:46.690]  the way that we are, for the most part.
[01:08:46.690 --> 01:08:48.210]  You know, Miami, whatever the case is.
[01:08:48.210 --> 01:08:50.970]  So you're lucky to get good flour, whatever the case is.
[01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:52.650]  And that's what it was.
[01:08:52.650 --> 01:08:57.210]  So at first it kind of made me interesting to think,
[01:08:57.210 --> 01:09:00.010]  you know, how it would affect our child.
[01:09:00.010 --> 01:09:02.970]  But seeing, you know, my partner in pain
[01:09:02.970 --> 01:09:04.250]  and not being able to work,
[01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:06.410]  or literally not being able to stand up straight
[01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:08.770]  because she would have to run to the bathroom and throw up,
[01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:10.050]  cannabis is what helped, you know?
[01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:12.170]  Like literally just a single puff or two
[01:09:12.170 --> 01:09:14.570]  would hold her over for six to eight hours.
[01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:15.690]  You know, it was awesome.
[01:09:15.690 --> 01:09:18.690]  It was not like a heavy, you know, dose.
[01:09:18.690 --> 01:09:20.810]  It was really, even back then,
[01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.290]  it helped me see the medical attributes
[01:09:24.290 --> 01:09:27.810]  that we weren't seeing, you know, beyond getting high.
[01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:31.010]  So my opinion on it is, ladies,
[01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:34.770]  when it comes to the dabbing, you know,
[01:09:35.610 --> 01:09:40.610]  I can't say that I approve of anything made with solvents
[01:09:41.570 --> 01:09:46.570]  because we've yet to see these effects on infants.
[01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:49.410]  And I mean, as adults, you know, we do them.
[01:09:49.410 --> 01:09:51.890]  And, you know, regardless of whether it's clean
[01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:54.250]  to the state standards, and I mean, you know,
[01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:55.330]  you've seen the live resident.
[01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:59.010]  I mean, we'd love, you know, I love live resident and-
[01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:02.010]  My 100 pound body versus that few ounce fetus.
[01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:02.850]  Yeah.
[01:10:02.850 --> 01:10:05.090]  Completely different by residual solvent.
[01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.930]  Absolutely.
[01:10:05.930 --> 01:10:09.450]  So when it comes to that, we can talk dry sift, bubble,
[01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:10.690]  and at the same time, you know,
[01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:13.490]  unless that bubble hash or the full melts
[01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:16.650]  has been microbially tested or anything like, you know,
[01:10:17.690 --> 01:10:22.130]  you have to be beyond anal about your meds, you know?
[01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:24.370]  And I can't stress that enough, you know?
[01:10:24.370 --> 01:10:25.210]  So-
[01:10:25.210 --> 01:10:28.930]  So if we had some clean Rasta Jeff grown medicine
[01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:29.930]  that you know was clean,
[01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:31.410]  it wasn't sprayed with anything funky,
[01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.770]  it was grown with love, with organic nutrients,
[01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:36.130]  and then I harvested it and I passed it off to Fox
[01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:38.170]  and Fox made some clean,
[01:10:38.170 --> 01:10:39.530]  but we'll just stick with the flour.
[01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:40.370]  Yeah.
[01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.210]  Would then at that point,
[01:10:41.210 --> 01:10:44.330]  would you approve of pregnant mom smoking a little flour?
[01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:45.730]  Yeah, yeah, of course.
[01:10:45.730 --> 01:10:50.490]  And you know, my ex-girlfriend got pregnant
[01:10:50.490 --> 01:10:52.890]  and this is after we got separated.
[01:10:52.890 --> 01:10:56.570]  It would tear me up because she was a hardcore dabber
[01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:59.330]  and I'm like, but at the same time,
[01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:02.050]  she's a medical patient in her own regard
[01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.970]  to cancer survivor and she's here,
[01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:05.850]  you know, having her second child.
[01:11:05.850 --> 01:11:09.570]  Who am I to say, because I'm not sure, you know?
[01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:12.330]  And that's the other thing to that with my opinion.
[01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:16.130]  So, and she ended up having a beautiful little girl,
[01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:19.250]  like just the picture perfect, you know,
[01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:21.250]  picture of a little beautiful child.
[01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:25.050]  And I can't say shit, same with my daughter.
[01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:27.130]  I ended up with a gorgeous little girl
[01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:30.410]  and I'm super grateful and like nothing,
[01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:32.730]  my little kid's bright as shit, you know?
[01:11:32.730 --> 01:11:36.410]  I'm super blessed to have a little smart ass knucklehead
[01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:37.250]  on my hands.
[01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:39.450]  I've got a smart ass 12 year old daughter as well.
[01:11:39.450 --> 01:11:40.570]  Yeah.
[01:11:40.570 --> 01:11:44.010]  Her mom didn't consume much cannabis during pregnancy
[01:11:44.010 --> 01:11:47.210]  because her claim was that when she inhaled smoke,
[01:11:47.210 --> 01:11:49.770]  she's depriving the fetus of oxygen.
[01:11:49.770 --> 01:11:51.170]  So that was why she didn't want to smoke,
[01:11:51.170 --> 01:11:53.050]  but she did have a little bit of an edible
[01:11:53.050 --> 01:11:54.330]  if I remember one time.
[01:11:54.330 --> 01:11:56.010]  Well, you know, there's been like posts
[01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:56.890]  and stuff I've been seeing.
[01:11:57.610 --> 01:11:58.810]  I follow some of these mom groups and stuff
[01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:00.490]  because of the CBD stuff, obviously.
[01:12:00.490 --> 01:12:02.370]  And there's obviously a lot of posts
[01:12:02.370 --> 01:12:06.050]  about the pregnancy and smoking and fetuses don't,
[01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:07.730]  they're in the womb, you know,
[01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:10.410]  their lungs are developing.
[01:12:10.410 --> 01:12:15.410]  They're not taking in oxygen from the air outside.
[01:12:16.250 --> 01:12:18.050]  They're taking in what mom takes in.
[01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:20.370]  Yeah, because they would drown in amniotic fluid, right?
[01:12:20.370 --> 01:12:21.210]  Yeah.
[01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:22.050]  Or something, I'm not a doctor, but.
[01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:22.890]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:12:22.890 --> 01:12:24.490]  So that's been proven.
[01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:26.850]  So there goes that to the debate.
[01:12:27.810 --> 01:12:30.290]  And I just think with everything that we've been lied to
[01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:31.850]  about cannabis as well, you know,
[01:12:31.850 --> 01:12:34.010]  like there was a part of time Philip Morris
[01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:36.250]  said it was okay for you to have a smoke, you know,
[01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.090]  if you were pregnant.
[01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:37.930]  While you were pregnant.
[01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:39.130]  Yeah, so to that regard,
[01:12:39.130 --> 01:12:41.490]  I'd love for there to be some research done on it.
[01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:44.370]  You know, I would never, in my opinion,
[01:12:44.370 --> 01:12:46.530]  would I ever turn away a patient that was pregnant
[01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:49.450]  because from me, because of my opinion,
[01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:51.650]  no, I would totally do everything I can
[01:12:51.650 --> 01:12:54.370]  to offer them the cleanest meds to dab or smoke
[01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.250]  or, you know, preferably vaporize.
[01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:01.810]  Just me personally, I would just go out of the way
[01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:05.010]  to suggest the cleanest forms of medication,
[01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:08.530]  edibles, tinctures, vaporization, you know,
[01:13:08.530 --> 01:13:09.610]  that you can provide.
[01:13:10.770 --> 01:13:11.930]  I like your approach.
[01:13:11.930 --> 01:13:14.090]  Let the women do what women feel like they should do
[01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:15.850]  because we are not women nor doctors.
[01:13:15.850 --> 01:13:16.690]  Yeah.
[01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:19.490]  So to my listener who asked what we feel about it,
[01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:23.770]  I'm trying to find some information on it.
[01:13:23.770 --> 01:13:25.770]  There's not, all the information is conflicting.
[01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:27.490]  There's no real studies.
[01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:29.770]  There are hearsay studies, I think,
[01:13:29.770 --> 01:13:31.610]  but I don't think there's any like actual,
[01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:33.810]  this lady smoked all nine months of her pregnancy
[01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:36.410]  and this lady didn't, here's baby A and baby B.
[01:13:36.410 --> 01:13:37.450]  I haven't seen that yet.
[01:13:37.450 --> 01:13:41.370]  Well, there's been a study done about testing breast milk
[01:13:41.370 --> 01:13:43.850]  and they took the breast milk of women
[01:13:43.850 --> 01:13:46.490]  who never fucking smoke cannabis in their damn lives,
[01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:47.770]  let alone in their generation.
[01:13:47.770 --> 01:13:49.090]  I like where you're headed with this.
[01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:52.090]  And they found natural cannabinoids in breast milk.
[01:13:52.090 --> 01:13:55.730]  So here's my theory, you know,
[01:13:56.770 --> 01:14:00.050]  there's people that don't need to smoke cannabis
[01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.250]  or don't have a big involvement with it.
[01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:04.410]  And then I look at them like health wise
[01:14:04.410 --> 01:14:07.570]  and they seem to have a healthy endocannabinoid system
[01:14:07.570 --> 01:14:08.650]  that's self-regulating.
[01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:12.010]  There's no problem, you know, whatever the case is.
[01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.530]  That's obviously not the case with some of us, you know,
[01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:19.170]  as we need to regulate whatever, whether we need to work,
[01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.250]  whether we need to relax, whether we need to calm down.
[01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:22.930]  And we do it with this beautiful plant
[01:14:22.930 --> 01:14:27.410]  because our body's inability and deficiency
[01:14:27.410 --> 01:14:30.810]  of natural reoccurring cannabinoids.
[01:14:30.810 --> 01:14:32.690]  That can evolve while under whether we were breast milk.
[01:14:32.690 --> 01:14:34.290]  That's a whole nother fucking conversation,
[01:14:34.290 --> 01:14:36.530]  but back to my point.
[01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:38.770]  So there's natural cannabinoids in breast milk.
[01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:43.010]  It can hurt to, when you're doing, having clean medicine
[01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:46.770]  to enrich and nourish your natural, you know,
[01:14:46.770 --> 01:14:48.890]  milk to give your offspring,
[01:14:48.890 --> 01:14:52.890]  if it's only building and helping them have better antibodies
[01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:54.930]  and helping them build better, you know,
[01:14:54.930 --> 01:14:56.570]  immune systems and whatnot,
[01:14:57.650 --> 01:14:59.290]  and also giving them a better chance
[01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:02.330]  of not having deficiencies in those senses.
[01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:07.930]  So yeah, again, I'm all for more study of that, you know.
[01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.770]  The main point of life is to survive.
[01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:11.210]  So I think once that child's born,
[01:15:11.210 --> 01:15:12.690]  it will consume that breast milk.
[01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:14.770]  That breast milk has cannabinoids in it.
[01:15:14.770 --> 01:15:16.450]  What happens when you consume a lot of cannabinoids?
[01:15:16.450 --> 01:15:17.370]  You get hungrier, right?
[01:15:17.370 --> 01:15:18.210]  Yeah.
[01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.050]  So what are you gonna wanna do?
[01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:20.010]  You're gonna wanna consume more breast milk.
[01:15:20.010 --> 01:15:21.170]  What's that baby gonna do?
[01:15:21.170 --> 01:15:22.730]  Grow stronger, get stronger.
[01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:24.410]  And then what's it gonna want?
[01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:25.250]  More breast milk.
[01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:26.090]  Yeah.
[01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.930]  Yeah, so hopefully, hopefully this is true.
[01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:28.650]  It's shitty on titty, but hey, great for the baby.
[01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:29.850]  Hey, yeah, well, let's.
[01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:31.370]  So there's my two cents on that.
[01:15:31.370 --> 01:15:33.610]  I'm sorry if it's like a little awkward about it,
[01:15:33.610 --> 01:15:34.450]  but you know.
[01:15:34.450 --> 01:15:35.290]  I like your approach.
[01:15:35.290 --> 01:15:36.130]  Thank you.
[01:15:36.130 --> 01:15:38.810]  You know, I'd love to see more research done.
[01:15:38.810 --> 01:15:40.650]  I'd love to see, here's what I'd love to see.
[01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:44.490]  I'd love to see more moms justifying the science of it
[01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:49.490]  and being more, explaining the situation better.
[01:15:53.570 --> 01:15:57.090]  As opposed to just like taking a picture of their tit out
[01:15:57.090 --> 01:15:59.610]  in their kid's mouth and like saying that they're,
[01:15:59.610 --> 01:16:00.690]  you know, opposing something.
[01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:01.570]  Like, dude, no one cares.
[01:16:01.570 --> 01:16:02.410]  We're beyond that.
[01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:03.490]  Let's get to, you know,
[01:16:03.490 --> 01:16:04.850]  and I'm talking about cannabis moms,
[01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:05.850]  not just moms in general.
[01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:06.690]  You know, like I get it.
[01:16:06.690 --> 01:16:10.130]  And don't care, like free the titty, whatever.
[01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:12.010]  Like, anyways.
[01:16:12.010 --> 01:16:12.970]  Who's afraid of titties?
[01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:16.250]  Yeah, obviously a lot of people are.
[01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:17.330]  Terrible people.
[01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:18.170]  Horrible people.
[01:16:18.170 --> 01:16:19.330]  The same people that are afraid of cannabis.
[01:16:19.330 --> 01:16:20.170]  Exactly.
[01:16:20.170 --> 01:16:21.010]  So yeah, dude, you know,
[01:16:21.010 --> 01:16:25.170]  it's all for women doing that with cannabis, you know?
[01:16:25.170 --> 01:16:26.690]  And like I said, there's so,
[01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.210]  tinctures, fucking transdermals.
[01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.730]  I know of a mom that used like natural hemp products
[01:16:31.730 --> 01:16:33.370]  to not get any fucking stretch marks
[01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.350]  and she blew up like a damn whale
[01:16:35.350 --> 01:16:37.730]  and didn't stretch her fucking skin out once.
[01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:38.850]  I'm sorry to be blunt about it.
[01:16:38.850 --> 01:16:39.690]  I will not-
[01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:40.530]  Shout out to cannabis.
[01:16:40.530 --> 01:16:42.250]  I will not use her name, but shout out to cannabis.
[01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:43.090]  She knows who she is.
[01:16:43.090 --> 01:16:44.650]  Yeah, but just saying, you know,
[01:16:44.650 --> 01:16:46.850]  like even on a hemp CBD scale,
[01:16:46.850 --> 01:16:48.410]  it can just help your skin.
[01:16:48.410 --> 01:16:50.690]  It can help you have a more comfortable pregnancy.
[01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.210]  So why not?
[01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:53.030]  You want to be comfortable.
[01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:55.970]  You know, you don't want to be stressed at all at that time.
[01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:59.450]  So if cannabis, the CBD products, you know,
[01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:02.170]  can help you do that and they can, you know,
[01:17:02.170 --> 01:17:04.010]  I think that's a lot better than,
[01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:06.130]  I don't really know the science of prenatal drugs,
[01:17:06.130 --> 01:17:09.170]  but they make me a little curious.
[01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:11.330]  Yeah, you know, with all the vaccinations
[01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:13.610]  and all the crazy shit that we have going on
[01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:15.450]  with autism and other things like that,
[01:17:15.450 --> 01:17:17.170]  it just makes me curious and nervous.
[01:17:17.170 --> 01:17:19.210]  So, you know, go cannabis.
[01:17:19.210 --> 01:17:20.050]  Go cannabis.
[01:17:20.050 --> 01:17:22.010]  That is a great way to end this podcast.
[01:17:22.010 --> 01:17:23.330]  Bro, I want to thank you for coming and hanging out.
[01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:24.490]  You've been here for like three hours.
[01:17:24.490 --> 01:17:25.650]  I truly appreciate it.
[01:17:25.650 --> 01:17:27.650]  We probably smoked like a quarter ounce
[01:17:27.650 --> 01:17:28.930]  of hash over the time.
[01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:29.770]  Big shout out to Mike.
[01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:30.770]  Sorry I had to leave early.
[01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:32.890]  Make sure you guys follow White Mike on Twitter.
[01:17:32.890 --> 01:17:34.530]  It's at Nemo Punk 15.
[01:17:34.530 --> 01:17:36.530]  Make sure you support his Facebook page.
[01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.370]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:41.810]  Yeah, I didn't write that down or anything
[01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:42.650]  and I remembered it.
[01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:43.470]  So shout out, Mike.
[01:17:43.470 --> 01:17:44.810]  Thanks for coming on the show, bro.
[01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:45.970]  We're not mad that you had to leave early.
[01:17:45.970 --> 01:17:47.650]  We took plenty of dabs for you.
[01:17:47.650 --> 01:17:48.490]  Yes.
[01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:50.530]  I hope my listeners follow you on social media, bro.
[01:17:50.530 --> 01:17:54.170]  Oh, so I am FoxTrackCBD on Twitter.
[01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:57.370]  It's F-O-X-T-R-A-C-T-S, you guys,
[01:17:57.370 --> 01:17:58.210]  just to clear that up.
[01:17:58.210 --> 01:17:59.410]  FoxTrack. Thank you so much.
[01:17:59.410 --> 01:18:01.370]  Yes, I hope my listeners out there, hi.
[01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:02.930]  I appreciate that.
[01:18:02.930 --> 01:18:06.050]  FoxTrackCBD, spelled the same way.
[01:18:06.050 --> 01:18:08.690]  I'm sorry, just FoxTracks on Instagram
[01:18:08.690 --> 01:18:11.130]  and RunCBDGenetics on Instagram as well.
[01:18:11.130 --> 01:18:14.610]  And then also, I'm gonna, just on a really quick note,
[01:18:15.570 --> 01:18:19.410]  I'm gonna be in-house working with a new company
[01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:23.250]  called Athena Green and it's another breeder
[01:18:23.250 --> 01:18:27.530]  that's focused on medical strains,
[01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:30.930]  focusing on clusters and migraine headaches, Crohn's,
[01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:33.290]  and then I'm working together with the stuff I'm doing
[01:18:33.290 --> 01:18:37.070]  with my CBD in similar regards to help create
[01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:43.690]  better medicinal attributed strains with good terps.
[01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:45.130]  Very simple.
[01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:46.890]  Just a very simple goal.
[01:18:46.890 --> 01:18:49.290]  So it's hard to get that good medicine
[01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:51.930]  and good tasting medicine in the same regard.
[01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:53.730]  So that's our goal for the years
[01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:57.130]  and I'll obviously be talking with you about that sooner.
[01:18:57.130 --> 01:18:58.690]  We will collab on some of that, I'm sure.
[01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:59.770]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:18:59.770 --> 01:19:02.130]  So yeah, you'll see everything posted
[01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:05.850]  on my Instagram, FoxTracks, or on the RunCBD page
[01:19:05.850 --> 01:19:08.130]  or on Twitter when I'm bored
[01:19:08.130 --> 01:19:10.370]  because I'm dumb and I forget how to use it.
[01:19:11.610 --> 01:19:12.890]  A lot of people forget about the Twitter.
[01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:13.730]  Yeah, sorry.
[01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:14.570]  I'm all over Twitter.
[01:19:14.570 --> 01:19:15.390]  A lot of people use it.
[01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:16.850]  Yeah, it's going down.
[01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:18.010]  It's slowed down a little bit.
[01:19:18.010 --> 01:19:19.290]  All right, you guys, I want to thank you guys
[01:19:19.290 --> 01:19:20.210]  for listening.
[01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:21.290]  Fox, thanks for coming, bro.
[01:19:21.290 --> 01:19:22.390]  Anytime, thank you for having me.
[01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.410]  I'll be back in just a second.
[01:19:23.410 --> 01:19:25.690]  We will wrap up the show, you guys.
[01:19:25.690 --> 01:19:26.850]  All right, everybody, I hope you guys enjoyed
[01:19:26.850 --> 01:19:28.010]  that talk about CBD.
[01:19:28.010 --> 01:19:29.530]  I want to send a huge thank you to Mike
[01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:31.250]  and also a big huge thank you to Kabuki
[01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:32.850]  for joining me on the show.
[01:19:32.850 --> 01:19:33.830]  Thanks again for listening, everybody.
[01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:35.810]  I'll be back in seven days with another episode.
[01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:39.090]  I'll be back with episode number 131.
[01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:39.930]  I don't have any sponsors.
[01:19:39.930 --> 01:19:41.130]  If you'd like to sponsor the podcast
[01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:42.730]  or if you've got a product you'd like me to review,
[01:19:42.730 --> 01:19:43.550]  send me an email.
[01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:44.650]  It's growfromyourheart.hotmail.com.
