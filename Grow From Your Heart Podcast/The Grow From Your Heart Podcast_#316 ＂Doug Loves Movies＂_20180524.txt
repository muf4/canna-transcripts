[00:45.460 --> 00:55.310]  it's time for another episode of the Grow From Your Heart podcast. Welcome
[00:55.310 --> 00:59.910]  back podcast world. It's time for episode 316, a quick Thursday episode. You know I
[00:59.910 --> 01:02.990]  like to start the show off by letting you know what I'm smoking on. I've been
[01:03.030 --> 01:07.230]  taking dabs of sour kosher live resin full spectrum extract from our friends
[01:07.230 --> 01:12.430]  at Green Dot Labs. This stuff is delicious. It kind of smells like dirty feet with
[01:12.430 --> 01:17.150]  diesel fuel poured over it and I really like it. It sounds disgusting but it is
[01:17.150 --> 01:20.910]  so good. I took a big old dab of it and it just made my head go in slow motion.
[01:20.910 --> 01:25.630]  Everything just went so it's gonna be nice and calm. Should be a pretty good
[01:25.630 --> 01:30.270]  podcast. Alright guys, one thing I want to mention before we get into the show, I
[01:30.310 --> 01:33.790]  know that the episode numbers were out of order. What happened was I recorded
[01:33.790 --> 01:37.350]  the Monday episode. I put it up. I was like that'll come out Monday. Everything
[01:37.350 --> 01:42.630]  will be cool. It had a number. It was number 314. Then I decided, hey let's
[01:42.630 --> 01:47.790]  record a Sunday episode for moms on Mother's Day. I labeled that one 315
[01:47.790 --> 01:51.030]  because that's what my brain does. It went in order. I didn't think about it. I
[01:51.030 --> 01:56.830]  put that one out on Sunday. 315 came out on Sunday. 314 came out on Monday. Sorry,
[01:56.830 --> 01:59.790]  the numbers got out of order. A few people have tweeted me. I've gotten a
[01:59.790 --> 02:03.790]  couple of emails. I know it's wrong. You don't have to message me anymore. I'm not
[02:03.790 --> 02:09.070]  gonna fix it. We're at episode 316. Nothing went wrong. We are okay. But hey,
[02:09.070 --> 02:13.350]  thanks to everybody who messaged me and tried to keep me updated and let me know
[02:13.350 --> 02:17.230]  that I got out of order. I appreciate that. Anyway, moving forward, here we are
[02:17.230 --> 02:23.470]  episode 316. I want to talk a little bit about what I got to do this weekend. One
[02:23.470 --> 02:26.750]  of my favorite comedians is Doug Benson and of course Doug and I have kind of
[02:26.750 --> 02:29.750]  become buddies over the past few years since I've gone to so many of his shows.
[02:29.750 --> 02:34.310]  And interacted with him so much. Every year Doug Benson comes to Comedy Works
[02:34.310 --> 02:38.950]  in downtown Denver and does a live taping of his podcast called Doug Loves Movies.
[02:38.950 --> 02:44.990]  Doug Loves Movies is a podcast all about movies and movie trivia. Doug encourages
[02:44.990 --> 02:49.050]  the audience members to make name tags. It's not like a name tag that would say
[02:49.050 --> 02:53.330]  hi my name is Ross DeJeff, but it's more like a movie poster idea. The idea is
[02:53.330 --> 02:57.730]  that you print a movie poster and you replace a word in the movie title with
[02:57.730 --> 03:01.730]  your name and then replace one of the characters in the movie's face with your
[03:01.730 --> 03:05.130]  face and possibly add Doug Benson and whoever you think one of the guests on
[03:05.130 --> 03:09.730]  the shows may be. You swap their faces with the guest's face and your face and
[03:09.730 --> 03:13.730]  Doug's face. So it's a custom poster like maybe you might have a poster that says
[03:13.730 --> 03:18.050]  Ross DeJeff strikes back and you've taken out you've put Ross DeJeff's face
[03:18.050 --> 03:21.010]  right in the middle of it so it's Ross DeJeff strikes back swinging a big
[03:21.010 --> 03:26.250]  lightsaber looking like a Jedi. That's pretty cool. So that's the idea. You bring
[03:26.370 --> 03:32.090]  name tag posters and then Doug has three comedian guests that join him on stage
[03:32.090 --> 03:35.810]  and they come out and they select a name tag from the audience name tags and they
[03:35.810 --> 03:40.210]  are playing for that person. So if the celebrity wins then the person whose
[03:40.210 --> 03:43.290]  name tag they have selected wins the prizes that come from a prize bag. So
[03:43.290 --> 03:47.090]  that's sort of the idea behind what the the name tags the prizes and then there
[03:47.090 --> 03:50.770]  are games that happen and Doug plays random movie trivia games based on
[03:50.770 --> 03:54.250]  whatever he feels like doing that night and whatever he's got lined up for the
[03:54.250 --> 03:58.250]  show. So that's how Doug Benson's show happens that's what Doug Benson's show
[03:58.250 --> 04:03.010]  is. I know that I'm gonna get the opportunity to smoke before and or after
[04:03.010 --> 04:10.330]  the show with Doug Benson so I rolled up five 10-gram raw cones so I had a couple
[04:10.330 --> 04:14.970]  of 10-gram joints ready to smoke at all times. I had a couple in my pocket at all
[04:14.970 --> 04:20.170]  times in case something came up and of course we uh so I met my buddy I picked
[04:20.170 --> 04:24.170]  up my friend Baker and Baker and I drove to Comedy Works from downtown
[04:24.170 --> 04:27.610]  Denver. Baker lives a little off of downtown we drove to downtown Denver
[04:27.610 --> 04:32.850]  parked in the parking garage then we met up with my friend Brett, Mary's
[04:32.850 --> 04:37.170]  motivation on Instagram. We may have gotten a little bit stoned then we
[04:37.170 --> 04:42.890]  headed into Comedy Works. Around 4.15 we decided to go outside of Comedy Works
[04:42.890 --> 04:47.650]  and go smoke. I was carrying one of those raw cones in the package it was in the
[04:47.650 --> 04:51.810]  little uh the raw cones come in a package so that they're sold the the
[04:51.810 --> 04:55.210]  rolling paper without any cannabis is sold in this cone-shaped package so that
[04:55.210 --> 04:58.250]  the paper doesn't get destroyed. I just rolled the joint and put it back in
[04:58.250 --> 05:01.570]  there and then I was walking out of the comedy club just carrying that and a
[05:01.570 --> 05:04.770]  lighter so it was kind of obvious what was about to go happen and I looked
[05:04.770 --> 05:10.410]  behind me and it was myself and Brett and my friend Baker and another guy that
[05:10.410 --> 05:13.730]  I had seen before somewhere but I wasn't sure who the hell he was and then it
[05:13.730 --> 05:17.530]  dawned on me I said hey you're Deckard Doom and he goes yeah brother and he
[05:17.530 --> 05:21.570]  shook my hand it was a friend who had been watching my Instagram feed and we
[05:21.570 --> 05:24.970]  became Instagram friends and he told me he was gonna be at the show and I said
[05:24.970 --> 05:28.750]  hey if you see me come introduce yourself. He was smart enough to see me
[05:28.750 --> 05:33.590]  and my crew go walking out the back door of the club at 4.15 and thought I should
[05:33.590 --> 05:36.450]  probably follow those boys and he was smart because we went out there and
[05:36.450 --> 05:40.210]  smoked a 10 gram joint and there weren't very many people out there and the
[05:40.210 --> 05:44.050]  people who were out there were pretty damn cool. So anyway we finished smoking
[05:44.050 --> 05:48.010]  our joint and we go back inside everybody gets comfortable I worked out
[05:48.010 --> 05:51.210]  perfectly because right as we walked in our food and drinks were delivered to
[05:51.210 --> 05:54.770]  our table to our seats it was it was perfect timing it couldn't have been any
[05:54.770 --> 05:58.370]  better we sat there for just a couple of minutes I had time to pound down my
[05:58.370 --> 06:03.170]  snack and then the lights went out and the comedy show started. So it was Doug
[06:03.170 --> 06:08.450]  Loves Movies so Doug comes out and he tells jokes and sets up the show you
[06:08.450 --> 06:11.170]  know for a few minutes he talks about where he's gonna be for the next few
[06:11.170 --> 06:14.250]  weeks and tells all of his Doug plugs and just kind of hangs out with the
[06:14.250 --> 06:17.450]  audience and then he brings out his guests about five or ten minutes into
[06:17.450 --> 06:22.450]  the show. His guests this time were a comedian named Jacob Seroff who is
[06:22.450 --> 06:25.970]  known for traveling with Doug and doing a few Doug Loves Movies podcasts he's
[06:25.970 --> 06:29.730]  kind of a regular. There was another comedian by the name of Dan Cheeseman
[06:29.730 --> 06:33.810]  who is a semi-regular on the podcast and he is not the Cheeseman from Cheeseman
[06:33.810 --> 06:36.930]  Parks if you guys listen to the podcast there's plenty of jokes about that all
[06:36.930 --> 06:40.370]  the parks in Denver are called Cheeseman lots of businesses called Cheeseman
[06:40.370 --> 06:44.550]  something he is not that Dan Cheeseman. Then also another comedian by the name
[06:44.550 --> 06:49.130]  of John Toll who I've seen before at Comedy Works. John Toll is a funny dude
[06:49.130 --> 06:52.890]  he's got a CD available that was recorded at the downtown location of
[06:52.890 --> 06:58.130]  Comedy Works. He did a really good job of sitting in with the two semi-regulars
[06:58.130 --> 07:02.770]  it was his first time on the podcast. Doug likes to bring a hometown hero if
[07:02.770 --> 07:06.050]  you will to be on the show he picks a local comedian and lets them be on the
[07:06.050 --> 07:09.230]  show that way we feel like we've got sort of a connection you know what I
[07:09.230 --> 07:13.010]  mean one of our players is on the stage so Doug likes to do that I feel like
[07:13.010 --> 07:19.410]  John Toll held his own and fit in very well with the other comedians. So let's
[07:19.410 --> 07:21.770]  see where should I go from here let's give some shout outs I want to give a
[07:21.770 --> 07:25.970]  shout out to Doug Benson. After every show I've ever been to Doug has taken
[07:25.970 --> 07:29.810]  time to come outside and meet anybody who wants to meet him if you want to
[07:29.810 --> 07:32.650]  take a picture with Doug he'll be out there you can go smoke a joint take a
[07:32.650 --> 07:36.130]  picture with Doug Benson he doesn't mind he's friendly he's cool as shit so
[07:36.130 --> 07:40.050]  shout out to Doug for bringing the Doug Loves Movies podcast to Denver all the
[07:40.050 --> 07:44.090]  time it's one of my favorite podcasts and I love the games so big shout out to
[07:44.090 --> 07:48.610]  Doug Benson also a big shout out to Jacob Siroff who we're gonna talk about

[08:02.810 --> 08:05.410]  give a huge shout out to everybody at Comedy Works you guys Comedy Works
[08:05.410 --> 08:09.890]  treats me like royalty they say that I'm a regular and I don't feel like I go
[08:09.890 --> 08:12.930]  there often enough to be a regular but if they're gonna treat me like that I am
[08:12.930 --> 08:17.610]  going to take it I feel like they treat everybody super well Comedy Works is a
[08:17.610 --> 08:20.530]  super cool club if you've never gone to a comedy show and I've said this before
[08:20.530 --> 08:24.610]  go to a comedy club even if you can't go to Comedy Works even if you can't go to

[10:52.870 --> 10:58.410]  covered all of that stuff I said we were gonna talk about Jacob Siroff a little
[10:58.410 --> 11:03.730]  bit more when Doug Benson brought Jacob Siroff out on stage he pointed at me and
[11:03.730 --> 11:08.290]  he's like hey you you got to quit doing the Instagram live feeds what I'm gonna
[11:08.290 --> 11:12.650]  do is I'm gonna wrap up the podcast and I'm going to play a clip from the Doug
[11:12.650 --> 11:16.890]  Loves Movies podcast I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do that not sure if that
[11:16.890 --> 11:19.890]  episode this episode will get taken down or something because I'm using part of
[11:19.890 --> 11:23.250]  Doug's podcast Doug and I are friends but I didn't ask for permission or
[11:23.250 --> 11:26.970]  anything because I feel like if I do this part it'll be worth it hey guys one
[11:26.970 --> 11:31.210]  of my favorite podcasts is the Doug Loves Movies podcast I highly suggest
[11:31.210 --> 11:35.610]  that you listen to Doug Loves Movies if nothing else listen to the recent
[11:35.610 --> 11:39.050]  episode from Denver and hear them talk shit to me a bunch of times but you'll
[11:39.050 --> 11:43.050]  enjoy it it's a great show find an episode with Mark Wahlberg those are
[11:43.050 --> 11:46.290]  extra hilarious but anyway what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna wrap up the show
[11:46.290 --> 11:49.290]  I'm gonna do all my shout outs and my advertising and then I'm going to play a
[11:49.290 --> 11:52.770]  couple of seconds I'm not sure how long it is I'm gonna play the clip from the
[11:52.770 --> 11:57.570]  Doug Benson live taping in Denver of the Doug Loves Movies podcast where Jacob
[11:57.570 --> 12:01.250]  Siroff fucking attacked me from the stage you guys I'm just kidding it was
[12:01.250 --> 12:05.050]  it was all fun and games he was smiling the whole time but when he walked out on
[12:05.050 --> 12:09.570]  stage he immediately went to talking shit right to me it was fun we've met
[12:09.570 --> 12:14.050]  before and he came up to me right after and he's like dude you know I was joking
[12:14.050 --> 12:17.250]  right and before he could even walk out of the comedy club I knew he would come
[12:17.250 --> 12:21.010]  around the corner so I was doing an Instagram live feed as soon as he came
[12:21.010 --> 12:23.970]  out and I went like a news reporter I was like this guy Jacob Siroff right
[12:23.970 --> 12:27.370]  here says I go live on Instagram too much how do you feel about that and I
[12:27.370 --> 12:29.690]  turned the camera around and we did a little interview with them on Instagram

[14:27.600 --> 14:29.600]  Hi Denver, go Raiders!
[14:29.600 --> 14:39.720]  I was just about to say the Denver crowds love you because you come in here and you just you know you just you are what you are
[14:39.720 --> 14:45.120]  and then you immediately say something to upset them
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.960]  I'm thrilled to be here it's great I have to tell this guy though stop doing
[14:48.960 --> 14:54.120]  so much live internet you know the Instagram live don't do that that's
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.540]  annoying I just I met him last time I was here and he's always doing this I
[14:57.540 --> 15:01.040]  read genetics live right that's you yeah you're always doing the live video stop
[15:01.040 --> 15:04.240]  doing that I always hit the notification I have to clear it sometimes I hit I go
[15:04.240 --> 15:10.760]  in on accident I love him it's just too much as a crowd favorite I know it's
[15:10.760 --> 15:18.440]  just too much without without at least seeing you can't have this conversation with him in the alley after the show
[15:18.440 --> 15:20.440]  you're bringing it up now?
[15:20.440 --> 15:22.440]  Hey, it's me! It's that guy!

[15:33.160 --> 15:35.160]  You know that's annoying when you have to
[15:35.160 --> 15:40.560]  I didn't know maybe you had somewhere to be I want to make sure I told you
[15:40.560 --> 15:42.560]  I hope you're gonna hang out after.
