[00:00.000 --> 00:17.290]  Alright, here we go.
[00:17.290 --> 00:18.890]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:18.890 --> 00:21.450]  I'm your host, my friends call me Ross DeJeff.
[00:21.450 --> 00:26.170]  This is episode 747 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:26.170 --> 00:29.250]  In this episode, I'm going to read a couple of listener emails.
[00:29.250 --> 00:32.370]  Before we get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the kind of
[00:32.570 --> 00:36.850]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:36.850 --> 00:40.530]  Let's kick it all off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[00:40.530 --> 00:42.650]  my friend Thor's Trike Factory.

[00:51.450 --> 00:53.250]  DeGreen Thumb Genetics.
[00:53.250 --> 00:56.210]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to SC Dung Slinger.
[00:56.210 --> 00:58.210]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Captain Mojo.
[00:58.210 --> 01:00.630]  I want to send a big fist bump to my friend Luke.

[01:02.350 --> 01:04.470]  I want to send a big thank you to Trojan.
[01:04.470 --> 01:07.870]  I want to send a big thank you shout out to my buddy Sam Heads.
[01:07.870 --> 01:11.470]  Then let's wrap it all up with the Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to
[01:11.470 --> 01:13.210]  Orville Turner.
[01:13.210 --> 01:17.990]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:17.990 --> 01:21.590]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:21.590 --> 01:27.950]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:27.950 --> 01:30.710]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:30.710 --> 01:35.470]  You know I do include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it super
[01:35.470 --> 01:39.030]  easy for all of my friends to support the show.
[01:39.030 --> 01:44.390]  Speaking of support, I want to thank everybody for the words of support, encouragement, the
[01:44.390 --> 01:49.950]  thank you, the constructive criticism, the positive feedback on the episode that I did
[01:49.950 --> 01:51.350]  about never giving up.
[01:51.350 --> 01:54.650]  I recently did a podcast episode where somebody sent me a message.
[01:54.650 --> 01:56.190]  They said they were frustrated with their grow.
[01:56.190 --> 01:57.750]  They were thinking about giving up.
[01:57.750 --> 02:02.350]  I gave some advice that my main advice was focused on the grow room but most of that
[02:02.350 --> 02:04.910]  advice was also applicable to life.
[02:04.910 --> 02:09.630]  You could apply most of what I said to most situations in life to expand your knowledge,
[02:09.630 --> 02:12.830]  get better, move forward and conquer obstacles.
[02:12.830 --> 02:16.190]  I got a lot of great feedback on that podcast episode.
[02:16.190 --> 02:20.130]  I got a lot of great emails, a lot of YouTube comments, a lot of good constructive criticism
[02:20.130 --> 02:21.530]  and positive feedback.
[02:21.530 --> 02:23.990]  There are a lot of great people listening to this podcast.
[02:23.990 --> 02:28.190]  I wanted to take a moment and say thank you for all of the encouragement, the words of
[02:28.190 --> 02:29.190]  support.
[02:29.190 --> 02:33.390]  That really meant a lot to me to read so many positive words and so much great feedback
[02:33.390 --> 02:37.390]  on just a great episode that honestly I didn't know it was going to have such a big impact.
[02:37.390 --> 02:41.590]  Sometimes I put out these shows, I think the episode about cutting clones and selecting
[02:41.590 --> 02:45.790]  males and female plants and identifying sex and things, I think those are super important.
[02:45.790 --> 02:48.950]  The thing sometimes when I'm just rambling and saying things that I was just touching
[02:48.950 --> 02:52.310]  on a subject here, that's when people really seem to respond the most.
[02:52.310 --> 02:53.310]  Thank you.
[02:53.630 --> 02:54.630]  I'm so glad we get such a great feedback.
[02:54.630 --> 02:55.830]  I am rambling now.
[02:55.830 --> 02:57.190]  Let's talk about growing cannabis.
[02:57.190 --> 02:58.830]  This is a grow podcast.
[02:58.830 --> 03:00.230]  Thank you once again you guys.
[03:00.230 --> 03:01.470]  I do appreciate it.
[03:01.470 --> 03:04.590]  Again, I do apologize for the throat clearing dabs.
[03:04.590 --> 03:05.950]  We won't ramble on about that.
[03:05.950 --> 03:09.830]  I did mention previously that I did load up a greenhouse with some plants.
[03:09.830 --> 03:12.430]  I'm happy to say the plants are alive.
[03:12.430 --> 03:14.910]  It hasn't been very long since I put the plants in the greenhouse.
[03:14.910 --> 03:17.750]  Since I'm recording this episode, there is not much to report.
[03:17.750 --> 03:18.750]  They look happy.
[03:18.750 --> 03:19.750]  They're rooting.
[03:19.750 --> 03:20.830]  The roots are spreading into the dirt.
[03:20.830 --> 03:21.870]  They're bigger.
[03:21.870 --> 03:22.870]  Not a lot to report.
[03:23.430 --> 03:24.430]  They're alive.
[03:24.430 --> 03:28.070]  I'm not sure if you caught it, but I did say that the male plant I put out in the greenhouse
[03:28.070 --> 03:30.310]  was a Jack the Ripper male.
[03:30.310 --> 03:32.630]  There are two Jack the Ripper male plants.
[03:32.630 --> 03:33.830]  It's a clone of the same plant.
[03:33.830 --> 03:37.790]  I put two of them in different places in the growth strategically to work with the air
[03:37.790 --> 03:40.190]  flow to get maximum pollination.
[03:40.190 --> 03:44.430]  If you're wondering the plants that are in the greenhouse, the male is the Jack the Ripper.
[03:44.430 --> 03:48.510]  Over time, I will of course reveal some of the females out there, let you guys know what
[03:48.510 --> 03:50.070]  I'm working with.
[03:50.070 --> 03:53.430]  It's a Jack the Ripper male out there in the greenhouse.
[03:53.430 --> 03:54.430]  Where do we go from there?
[03:54.430 --> 03:57.250]  I've got the note that says everybody looks happy.
[03:57.250 --> 03:58.790]  All the plants look super happy.
[03:58.790 --> 04:00.870]  That's really all I've got to report on those plants.
[04:00.870 --> 04:05.070]  I did recently in a podcast, I may have appeared on another show.
[04:05.070 --> 04:10.830]  I may have been on Caribou Heart TV where I mentioned that I'm now breeding with a new
[04:10.830 --> 04:12.030]  male plant.
[04:12.030 --> 04:15.750]  A lot of people were a little bit confused, a little bit excited.
[04:15.750 --> 04:17.710]  There's a lot of confusion because I haven't talked too much about it.
[04:17.710 --> 04:19.470]  I do keep some things kind of secret.
[04:19.470 --> 04:20.470]  Some things under wraps.
[04:20.470 --> 04:21.830]  We talk about a lot of stuff.
[04:21.830 --> 04:24.830]  You have to have some secrets, that's how you win.
[04:24.830 --> 04:27.430]  But I didn't talk about this plant a lot.
[04:27.430 --> 04:29.030]  And then I did start talking about it.
[04:29.030 --> 04:30.150]  People were confused.
[04:30.150 --> 04:32.630]  Let me talk about the plant I was mentioning.
[04:32.630 --> 04:33.750]  I've got a male plant.
[04:33.750 --> 04:39.550]  I'm working with a male plant that is a BC Lemon Skunk male.
[04:39.550 --> 04:41.070]  It is a BC Lemon Skunk.
[04:41.070 --> 04:44.190]  BC is the seed company, BC Seed Company.
[04:44.190 --> 04:46.390]  It's from Vancouver, British Columbia.
[04:46.390 --> 04:49.150]  It's a British Columbia Lemon Skunk.
[04:49.830 --> 04:51.030]  The BC is not a back cross.
[04:51.030 --> 04:55.430]  A lot of people were asking, I saw on a message board, I saw on some forums, is that a back
[04:55.430 --> 04:56.430]  cross?
[04:56.430 --> 04:57.750]  Is BC for back cross?
[04:57.750 --> 04:59.670]  That could be what back cross is.
[04:59.670 --> 05:02.670]  But in this instance, it is a BC.
[05:02.670 --> 05:03.670]  That's why it's first.
[05:03.670 --> 05:04.990]  If it was back cross, it would have been at the end.
[05:04.990 --> 05:07.510]  I would have used a BX, which drives Pete crazy.
[05:07.510 --> 05:08.510]  Shout out to my buddy F1P.
[05:08.510 --> 05:09.510]  I hope you're well.
[05:09.510 --> 05:10.790]  I hope somebody tags you in this.
[05:10.790 --> 05:12.470]  I would have used BX.
[05:12.470 --> 05:14.510]  You're right, BC does work good for back cross.
[05:14.510 --> 05:15.950]  However, it would have been at the end.
[05:15.950 --> 05:17.990]  This is BC Lemon Skunk.
[05:17.990 --> 05:19.950]  That stands for British Columbia.
[05:19.950 --> 05:23.310]  It's a lemon skunk that came from Vancouver, British Columbia.
[05:23.310 --> 05:25.630]  That is a monster male plant.
[05:25.630 --> 05:26.630]  It makes amazing plants.
[05:26.630 --> 05:27.910]  We'll talk more about that in the future.
[05:27.910 --> 05:30.710]  I wanted to clear that up, that it is not a back cross.
[05:30.710 --> 05:36.070]  It is a BC Seed Company, a BC Lemon Skunk, a male, what we're working with.
[05:36.070 --> 05:40.230]  Now, one more detail I do want to throw out there involving the same topic.
[05:40.230 --> 05:46.910]  This is not the same lemon skunk that is used in the Lemon Jeffrey or the Lemon Sunrise
[05:47.030 --> 05:49.270]  or the Jack Tripper.
[05:49.270 --> 05:52.350]  This is a different lemon skunk plant.
[05:52.350 --> 05:59.350]  The lemon skunk that is used for the Lemon Jeffrey, the Lemon Sunrise, or the Firefly,
[05:59.670 --> 06:03.830]  the Jack Tripper, that is actually from greenhouse seeds.
[06:03.830 --> 06:04.630]  That is a female.
[06:04.630 --> 06:05.510]  It's only a female.
[06:05.510 --> 06:08.350]  That's actually a feminize seed that I've been breeding to.
[06:08.350 --> 06:10.230]  There's another ramble we could talk about.
[06:10.230 --> 06:13.590]  When people talk about you can't breed to fem seeds, well, you sure as shit can because
[06:13.630 --> 06:17.070]  I am reversing fem plants and breeding them to other fem plants.
[06:17.070 --> 06:19.550]  I'm getting way off topic here, but we're just rambling at this point.
[06:19.550 --> 06:24.430]  Anyway, the BC Lemon Skunk that I've been talking about is a BC Lemon Skunk from BC
[06:24.430 --> 06:25.070]  Seed Company.
[06:25.070 --> 06:25.670]  That's a boy.
[06:25.670 --> 06:26.990]  That's a dude.
[06:26.990 --> 06:31.470]  The other lemon skunk I've had for years and I've talked about a lot, that is a female
[06:31.470 --> 06:32.590]  from greenhouse.
[06:32.590 --> 06:35.190]  Those are different plants, completely different plants.
[06:35.190 --> 06:35.950]  Don't get confused.
[06:35.950 --> 06:37.550]  Wanted to clear that up.
[06:37.550 --> 06:40.750]  I hope that makes any sense to everybody out there.
[06:40.750 --> 06:43.510]  All right, let's segue into my next batch of notes here.
[06:43.510 --> 06:45.550]  I am recording right at the start of the month.
[06:45.550 --> 06:51.310]  Today is June 1st, so it is a good idea to take this opportunity to remind you to calibrate
[06:51.310 --> 06:52.230]  your equipment.
[06:52.230 --> 06:56.670]  If you've got a pH meter, an EC meter, whatever kind of meter you're working with, maybe you're
[06:56.670 --> 07:00.190]  using a Dosatron, go calibrate all of those devices.
[07:00.190 --> 07:01.510]  Now is a very good time to do it.
[07:01.510 --> 07:05.350]  The start of the month is a beautiful time to clean up and calibrate things.
[07:05.350 --> 07:08.110]  If you've got filters, go clean them.
[07:08.110 --> 07:10.750]  If you've got something that needs to be cleaned up, go clean it.
[07:10.750 --> 07:12.910]  Take the first of the month just to go polish shit up.
[07:13.030 --> 07:14.470]  It's the start of the summer season.
[07:14.470 --> 07:15.710]  Get in there and clean some shit up.
[07:15.710 --> 07:17.510]  Get a head start on summer cleaning.
[07:17.510 --> 07:18.630]  Make the grow room shine.
[07:18.630 --> 07:20.110]  Get ahead of any problems.
[07:20.110 --> 07:21.270]  Go in there and find the issues.
[07:21.270 --> 07:23.190]  Go clean everything up.
[07:23.190 --> 07:24.990]  Go calibrate all of your meters.
[07:24.990 --> 07:26.310]  Clean the air conditioner vents.
[07:26.310 --> 07:29.630]  If you've got one of those portable air conditioners, that thing has a filter in it.
[07:29.630 --> 07:32.430]  If you've got another kind of air conditioner, it could have a filter in it.
[07:32.430 --> 07:36.350]  If you're using a heater, that sounds crazy, but last night in Colorado, the heater came
[07:36.350 --> 07:38.310]  on because it got super fucking cold.
[07:38.310 --> 07:41.550]  If you're using a heater, maybe clean the filter on the heater.
[07:41.590 --> 07:43.270]  Everything's got a filter that needs to be cleaned.
[07:43.270 --> 07:45.230]  Maybe you're running some kind of hydro gear.
[07:45.230 --> 07:46.230]  Maybe you're running something.
[07:46.230 --> 07:47.750]  Maybe go clean all the fans.
[07:47.750 --> 07:51.230]  Today is a good day to clean all of your grow equipment.
[07:51.230 --> 07:54.190]  For now, I'm going to focus on our pH meter.
[07:54.190 --> 07:57.870]  Recently, I was at somebody's grow and they were excited because they just bought ... I
[07:57.870 --> 07:59.870]  recommended a Bluelab pH pen.
[07:59.870 --> 08:01.670]  Bluelab doesn't pay me.
[08:01.670 --> 08:05.710]  Maybe I shouldn't even have said the brand, but I recommended a brand new Bluelab pH meter
[08:05.710 --> 08:06.710]  to my friend.
[08:06.710 --> 08:07.710]  They went and got it.
[08:07.710 --> 08:08.910]  We showed up at their grow together.
[08:08.910 --> 08:10.710]  We're going to hang out and work on their plants.
[08:10.870 --> 08:15.990]  My buddy busted out a Bluelab pH pen, took it right out of the box, mixed up some nutrients
[08:15.990 --> 08:20.150]  and plopped it right into the solution and read it and said, pH is great.
[08:20.150 --> 08:24.070]  I was like, bro, you didn't do that correctly at all.
[08:24.070 --> 08:25.070]  He's like, what do you mean?
[08:25.070 --> 08:26.630]  I was like, you got to calibrate that.
[08:26.630 --> 08:28.110]  He was like, what do you mean?
[08:28.110 --> 08:31.230]  I was like, you've got to calibrate your pH meter.
[08:31.230 --> 08:33.070]  He didn't even think about this.
[08:33.070 --> 08:34.070]  Did you know?
[08:34.070 --> 08:35.070]  Do you know?
[08:35.070 --> 08:38.010]  I'm going to tell you now just because a lot of people apparently do not know that when
[08:38.090 --> 08:43.850]  you buy your pH pen in the instruction book, it is recommended that you soak that pH probe
[08:43.850 --> 08:48.850]  in a pH calibration solution for 24 hours before calibrating it.
[08:48.850 --> 08:50.050]  Did you know that?
[08:50.050 --> 08:52.370]  You just paid $100 for that device.
[08:52.370 --> 08:56.410]  Why not follow the instructions and set it up correctly to work correctly?
[08:56.410 --> 09:01.010]  We're going to rely on this device to measure the nutrient solution, which we are feeding
[09:01.010 --> 09:02.450]  our entire crop.
[09:02.450 --> 09:05.310]  These nutrients, you paid a lot of money for the nutrients.
[09:05.310 --> 09:09.190]  You want those nutrients to give you maximum benefit on the crop which you were growing.
[09:09.190 --> 09:13.070]  Why wouldn't you make sure the tools that you just paid money for are not dialed in
[09:13.070 --> 09:15.470]  and calibrated fucking perfectly?
[09:15.470 --> 09:18.550]  That's what I would do if it were up to me.
[09:18.550 --> 09:21.870]  When you get that new pH pen, when it comes out of the box, the first thing you should
[09:21.870 --> 09:26.870]  do is set it in that calibration solution for 24 hours.
[09:26.870 --> 09:28.470]  It'll say 12 to 24 hours.
[09:28.470 --> 09:32.270]  It may say 24 hours plus on your package, on your instructions.
[09:32.270 --> 09:33.270]  Read those, do that.
[09:33.270 --> 09:36.870]  Some of them may not recommend it, but in the Blue Lab, it was definitely recommended
[09:36.870 --> 09:37.870]  in the instructions.
[09:37.870 --> 09:39.830]  My buddy didn't even bother to calibrate it.
[09:39.830 --> 09:40.830]  He took it out.
[09:40.830 --> 09:41.830]  Sorry I'm calling you out, bro.
[09:41.830 --> 09:42.830]  We're not going to say your name, but he is listening.
[09:42.830 --> 09:43.830]  What's up, bro?
[09:43.830 --> 09:44.830]  Fist bump.
[09:44.830 --> 09:45.830]  Hope you're well.
[09:45.830 --> 09:46.830]  Salute.
[09:46.830 --> 09:47.830]  Anyway, he took it right out of the box and plopped it in there and stirred it around.
[09:47.830 --> 09:48.830]  It was like, the pH looks good.
[09:48.830 --> 09:52.790]  I was like, what the fuck are you doing, bro?
[09:52.790 --> 09:53.790]  Adjust it.
[09:53.790 --> 09:54.790]  Calibrate that thing.
[09:54.790 --> 09:55.790]  Calibrate it.
[09:55.790 --> 09:57.230]  It needs to be, who knows how long it's been sitting in the box.
[09:57.230 --> 09:59.030]  Who knows if it got calibrated?
[09:59.030 --> 10:02.190]  Who knows what the guy at the factory calibrated it at?
[10:02.190 --> 10:04.030]  Let it soak in the solution, then take it out.
[10:04.030 --> 10:07.310]  Then there are very simple steps for calibrating a pH pen.
[10:07.310 --> 10:10.230]  Most of them, it's going to be a couple of buttons until one thing flickers.
[10:10.230 --> 10:12.350]  You put it in the four solution until it says four.
[10:12.350 --> 10:17.030]  Then you're going to put it in the other solution, clean it off between solutions, pull it out
[10:17.030 --> 10:20.630]  of the four, rinse it off in clean water, then put it in the seven, then make sure it
[10:20.630 --> 10:21.990]  comes on at the seven.
[10:21.990 --> 10:23.390]  Then here's what I recommend.
[10:23.390 --> 10:31.350]  Buy another batch of four and or seven solution because just like I don't trust that calibration,
[10:31.510 --> 10:35.590]  original pen calibration, I don't trust these solutions either.
[10:35.590 --> 10:37.170]  Sometimes they go dry.
[10:37.170 --> 10:38.170]  Sometimes they expire.
[10:38.170 --> 10:40.150]  I'm a suspicious fucking person.
[10:40.150 --> 10:41.150]  I got trust issues.
[10:41.150 --> 10:44.430]  I do not trust these calibration solutions at all.
[10:44.430 --> 10:47.550]  I buy another fresh bottle of four and seven.
[10:47.550 --> 10:50.030]  I pour a little bit of them into little containers.
[10:50.030 --> 10:56.230]  Then I re-dip my testing probe into that and make sure it shows me four, clean it off,
[10:56.230 --> 10:59.950]  dip it in the other one, make sure it shows me seven on my backup solutions.
[10:59.950 --> 11:04.230]  I've got four tests that are positive that show me that it's actually calibrated the
[11:04.230 --> 11:05.990]  way that I think it is.
[11:05.990 --> 11:08.830]  I would soak it in the solution for 24 hours.
[11:08.830 --> 11:11.990]  Then when you're going to go in the grow the next day, pull it out, clean it off, put it
[11:11.990 --> 11:16.310]  in the four solution, calibrate it properly, put it in the seven, calibrate it properly,
[11:16.310 --> 11:18.510]  clean it off between each of those.
[11:18.510 --> 11:23.390]  Then pour your other brand, your other bottle of calibration solution, your backup standard
[11:23.390 --> 11:25.930]  is what that is, your backups testing sample.
[11:25.930 --> 11:30.370]  Then test those again and make sure that they all come out properly, four and seven
[11:30.370 --> 11:31.450]  as you calibrate it.
[11:31.450 --> 11:33.730]  That way you're double checking your equipment.
[11:33.730 --> 11:37.030]  Like I said before, we're paying a lot of money for our nutrients.
[11:37.030 --> 11:39.290]  We pay a lot of money for the pH pen.
[11:39.290 --> 11:45.530]  We're putting a lot of money, time, space, energy, possibly felonies into our grow.
[11:45.530 --> 11:46.890]  There's a lot of things going into this.
[11:46.890 --> 11:51.570]  Why wouldn't we calibrate our pH pen and get the pH the best that we can?
[11:51.570 --> 11:53.970]  If you're just buying the thing and using it, it might not be perfect.
[11:54.010 --> 11:56.810]  I'm going to keep saying it, calibrate the damn pH pen.
[11:56.810 --> 11:57.910]  Do it today.
[11:57.910 --> 11:59.090]  Do it while you're thinking about it.
[11:59.090 --> 12:00.510]  Do it while I'm rambling.
[12:00.510 --> 12:05.090]  It's only going to take you a few minutes if you've got the proper solutions.
[12:05.090 --> 12:07.430]  I said it before, we're spending all this money on nutrients.
[12:07.430 --> 12:10.130]  We want the plants to be able to uptake those nutrients.
[12:10.130 --> 12:12.170]  Without the proper pH, they won't.
[12:12.170 --> 12:13.450]  Some stuff will just get left out.
[12:13.450 --> 12:15.010]  You may be adding CalMag.
[12:15.010 --> 12:18.170]  Let's just say those are two separate nutrients.
[12:18.170 --> 12:19.570]  We're going to stick with the bottle of CalMag.
[12:19.570 --> 12:21.370]  It's sold in one bottle most of the time.
[12:21.370 --> 12:23.010]  You're buying this bottle of CalMag.
[12:23.050 --> 12:26.450]  If your pH isn't right, you're putting the CalMag into your feed solution.
[12:26.450 --> 12:28.010]  You're pouring that into the plants and guess what?
[12:28.010 --> 12:29.010]  It's falling out of the bottom.
[12:29.010 --> 12:32.290]  They're not even eating it because your pH isn't correct.
[12:32.290 --> 12:33.610]  Adjust, correct that pH.
[12:33.610 --> 12:36.010]  Most of the plants, I'm not going to delve too far into pH.
[12:36.010 --> 12:39.810]  I wanted to ramble more about calibrating your equipment.
[12:39.810 --> 12:44.290]  Most plants are going to like a pH of somewhere between 5.8 and 6.4.
[12:44.290 --> 12:47.010]  If you can get within that range, most of your plants will be happy.
[12:47.010 --> 12:48.630]  Do pay attention.
[12:48.630 --> 12:51.730]  Maybe 6.3, 6.2 will be a little bit better.
[12:51.730 --> 12:55.730]  This will depend on the age of your plants, the size of your plants, of course, the health
[12:55.730 --> 13:00.250]  of your plants, the growth stage of your plants, also the amount of food you're giving them.
[13:00.250 --> 13:03.130]  A lot of stuff will depend on also the medium.
[13:03.130 --> 13:07.330]  I was going to say if you're in cocoa, are you in soil, soilless mix, what are you doing?
[13:07.330 --> 13:09.590]  That's going to make a big difference also.
[13:09.590 --> 13:10.590]  Get that pH dialed in.
[13:10.590 --> 13:13.650]  Most importantly, get your equipment dialed in.
[13:13.650 --> 13:14.970]  Go clean some shit up.
[13:14.970 --> 13:18.510]  Clean the fans, clean the air conditioners, go clean your scissors.
[13:18.510 --> 13:19.510]  Maybe buy some new scissors.
[13:19.630 --> 13:23.750]  If you've been cutting a bunch of clones, maybe today is the day to buy some new scissors.
[13:23.750 --> 13:28.270]  If you're using a sprayer to spray the garden, clean the shit out of that thing.
[13:28.270 --> 13:30.830]  Another thing we can think about is inventory.
[13:30.830 --> 13:34.390]  Do you have enough nutrients to get yourself through the crop that you're working on now?
[13:34.390 --> 13:38.290]  Do you have enough gloves to get yourself through the crop that you're working on?
[13:38.290 --> 13:39.290]  Are you prepared for harvest?
[13:39.290 --> 13:41.110]  Are you about to cut down some plants?
[13:41.110 --> 13:42.110]  Are you ready?
[13:42.110 --> 13:43.110]  Are you prepared?
[13:43.110 --> 13:46.130]  Right at the first of the month is always a good time to go take an inventory, order
[13:46.130 --> 13:48.150]  all of the shit that you need for the rest of the month.
[13:48.150 --> 13:49.870]  That way you don't have to stress about it.
[13:49.870 --> 13:53.710]  That way on watering day when it comes time to feed, you're mixing up, you got your pH
[13:53.710 --> 13:55.990]  probe in there, you're like, I need some cow mag.
[13:55.990 --> 13:57.910]  You go, fuck, I'm all out of cow mag.
[13:57.910 --> 14:00.190]  You don't want to find out while you're in the grow mixing shit up.
[14:00.190 --> 14:01.190]  Go check right now.
[14:01.190 --> 14:02.190]  Go shake the bottles.
[14:02.190 --> 14:03.630]  Go make a Google doc.
[14:03.630 --> 14:05.190]  Go make a spreadsheet.
[14:05.190 --> 14:09.630]  Go start making a list of things that you use and then mark how much is in each bottle.
[14:09.630 --> 14:10.630]  Keep track of it.
[14:10.630 --> 14:13.350]  Figure out how often you got to buy it, how often you got to order it.
[14:13.350 --> 14:16.670]  Also, this will help you keep track of how much you were spending in the garden.
[14:16.670 --> 14:21.550]  You can determine how much you are spending per pound or per ounce every harvest in your
[14:21.550 --> 14:22.550]  grow.
[14:22.550 --> 14:25.710]  All right, I've rambled on enough about the first of the month adjustments.
[14:25.710 --> 14:26.830]  Let's move on a little bit.
[14:26.830 --> 14:30.590]  Another thing that I did notice in my friend's grow, yeah, your grow, bro.
[14:30.590 --> 14:32.270]  We're going to talk about this real quick.
[14:32.270 --> 14:35.190]  My buddy's running three and five gallon pots in his grow room.
[14:35.190 --> 14:37.710]  He's got cocoa amended with perlite in there.
[14:37.710 --> 14:38.810]  He's got plastic pots.
[14:38.810 --> 14:41.230]  The plants look pretty good for the most part.
[14:41.230 --> 14:44.510]  There could be, he knows what he needs to do to make them look amazing.
[14:44.510 --> 14:45.750]  We don't need to air his business.
[14:45.830 --> 14:47.950]  We are going to call him out for one thing though.
[14:47.950 --> 14:50.410]  My dude is way over filling his pots.
[14:50.410 --> 14:52.630]  When you guys are putting, this is my recommendation.
[14:52.630 --> 14:56.250]  You guys and gals can do whatever you want in your grow, but my recommendation, this
[14:56.250 --> 14:57.250]  may help you out.
[14:57.250 --> 15:03.550]  This may be just my buddy's brain fucking really dinged when I gave him this advice.
[15:03.550 --> 15:06.710]  He fills the pots completely with cocoa.
[15:06.710 --> 15:08.590]  Let's just say that a five gallon pot is this tall.
[15:08.590 --> 15:10.030]  It's not, but we're going to say that.
[15:10.030 --> 15:11.550]  The five gallon pot is this tall.
[15:11.550 --> 15:14.610]  My dude had cocoa to here.
[15:14.610 --> 15:15.850]  It was to here.
[15:15.850 --> 15:17.890]  It was almost falling out of the pot.
[15:17.890 --> 15:19.810]  I was like, bro, why'd you put so much cocoa in there?
[15:19.810 --> 15:21.170]  He's like, it's a five gallon pot.
[15:21.170 --> 15:23.690]  Why wouldn't I put five gallons of cocoa in there?
[15:23.690 --> 15:27.850]  That's a really good thought process, but how am I going to water this shit?
[15:27.850 --> 15:28.850]  He's like, what?
[15:28.850 --> 15:32.690]  I was like, I'm pouring in water and I have to stand here and just fucking wait for it,
[15:32.690 --> 15:33.690]  dude.
[15:33.690 --> 15:35.730]  I've got my watering container and I'm pouring in the water.
[15:35.730 --> 15:39.930]  It's going to need somewhere between probably a half to maybe two thirds of that gallon
[15:39.930 --> 15:41.210]  of water that I've got.
[15:41.370 --> 15:45.090]  Instead of just being able to pour it in there, it's like running off the top of the pot because
[15:45.090 --> 15:47.330]  he's got it so full in that cocoa.
[15:47.330 --> 15:49.730]  It's not hydrophobic, but it's packed in there pretty well.
[15:49.730 --> 15:53.290]  It's where I can't absorb it as quickly as I want to pour it.
[15:53.290 --> 15:56.890]  If my dude would have left, I don't know, maybe an inch, maybe two inches, maybe an
[15:56.890 --> 16:00.810]  inch and a half of space at the top of that pot, maybe just a half an inch, I'd be able
[16:00.810 --> 16:04.650]  to just pour that water in and it would spread across the top and then puddle down in there
[16:04.650 --> 16:05.650]  evenly.
[16:05.650 --> 16:09.130]  But instead, I'm over there just fucking trickling water in.
[16:09.130 --> 16:12.450]  My advice to you, just leave a little bit of space so that that way we can get some
[16:12.450 --> 16:13.450]  water in the pot.
[16:13.450 --> 16:15.250]  You just pour that water right on there.
[16:15.250 --> 16:17.090]  Keep moving, keep going, keep growing.
[16:17.090 --> 16:18.090]  All right.
[16:18.090 --> 16:19.090]  I've rambled on enough.
[16:19.090 --> 16:20.650]  I did say I was going to answer some emails.
[16:20.650 --> 16:23.870]  Let's jump into the email portion of this podcast.
[16:23.870 --> 16:26.370]  This one comes from my friend Wicked Nugs.
[16:26.370 --> 16:27.370]  What's up Wicked Nugs?
[16:27.370 --> 16:29.050]  Thank you for the great question.
[16:29.050 --> 16:34.810]  It does go on and it does say, I was just listening to episode 651.
[16:34.810 --> 16:36.570]  You're way behind, brother.
[16:36.570 --> 16:38.330]  Maybe you're caught up and going back, but thanks for listening.
[16:38.530 --> 16:40.770]  It says, and I had a couple of questions.
[16:40.770 --> 16:45.810]  How does a breeder find a gem bag seed and create a new strain from it, not knowing the
[16:45.810 --> 16:49.970]  lineage of that genetic strain and start breeding from it?
[16:49.970 --> 16:50.970]  That's a really good question.
[16:50.970 --> 16:55.410]  It says, I love the show and I listened to it during the grow, during the busy work life
[16:55.410 --> 16:56.730]  and the AirPods.
[16:56.730 --> 17:03.450]  It feels like I just gained so much knowledge and helps pass time and I learn and take notes.
[17:03.450 --> 17:04.450]  That's what I'm thinking about.
[17:04.450 --> 17:07.450]  When I'm doing the show, I'm usually thinking that people are either watching on YouTube
[17:07.570 --> 17:09.890]  or they're working with me in their AirPods.
[17:09.890 --> 17:12.770]  Big up for letting me know that I'm getting you through a work day.
[17:12.770 --> 17:14.530]  That's what I used to do when I was at the Commercial Grows.
[17:14.530 --> 17:19.530]  I just put on the AirPods and throw something good in the ears and just jam all day.
[17:19.530 --> 17:23.350]  When people see two AirPods in, they know that you're not supposed to talk to you.
[17:23.350 --> 17:25.290]  That always made life easy.
[17:25.290 --> 17:27.390]  Goes on, learning a lot of knowledge.
[17:27.390 --> 17:28.390]  Thank you, bro.
[17:28.390 --> 17:30.610]  I'm glad to hear that you're learning and taking notes.
[17:30.610 --> 17:33.450]  That's what the goal is here, is to teach people, get everybody growing the best herb
[17:33.450 --> 17:34.710]  they can grow.
[17:34.710 --> 17:37.210]  Thank you for that.
[17:37.250 --> 17:39.130]  Then it says, thanks for all you do, Rasta Jeff.
[17:39.130 --> 17:40.130]  Keep up the growing.
[17:40.130 --> 17:42.450]  P.S. I gave my mom a hug for you.
[17:42.450 --> 17:43.730]  Sincerely, Wicked Nugs.
[17:43.730 --> 17:44.730]  Big up, bro.
[17:44.730 --> 17:45.730]  Thank you.
[17:45.730 --> 17:46.730]  Now let's talk about the question.
[17:46.730 --> 17:51.210]  The question is, how does a breeder find a gem bag seed and breed from it not knowing
[17:51.210 --> 17:54.850]  the lineage of that strain?
[17:54.850 --> 17:56.790]  That's a good question.
[17:56.790 --> 17:59.730]  I've got a couple of different thought processes on that.
[17:59.730 --> 18:04.650]  First of all, if it's a good strain, if it's a good plant, you can tell.
[18:04.650 --> 18:10.450]  It doesn't matter at all what the history, genetics, lineage, story behind it is.
[18:10.450 --> 18:15.130]  When a grower grows a plant, we just go, oh shit, that's the one.
[18:15.130 --> 18:16.490]  Sometimes you just know.
[18:16.490 --> 18:17.930]  Sometimes you know that's not the one.
[18:17.930 --> 18:19.330]  Sometimes you hope it's the one.
[18:19.330 --> 18:21.970]  Sometimes you really, really know that that's the one.
[18:21.970 --> 18:26.370]  If it's a random plant that nobody knows really the story of it, maybe it's just ... If it
[18:26.370 --> 18:28.650]  came from a bag, you know at least one half of it.
[18:28.650 --> 18:31.170]  It came from this bag that's called this.
[18:31.170 --> 18:33.450]  You know half of it probably.
[18:34.250 --> 18:37.410]  Now it's too easy to know all the stuff.
[18:37.410 --> 18:40.370]  Back in the day ... Let's talk about a very famous cross.
[18:40.370 --> 18:44.530]  Let's talk about a very famous, very, very famous strain that happened a lot like this.
[18:44.530 --> 18:50.450]  I recommend, after you listen to this podcast, I recommend checking out the legend of Chemdog
[18:50.450 --> 18:51.770]  and the 13 beans.
[18:51.770 --> 18:55.950]  If you're a cannabis enthusiast, a strain hunter, a pheno hunter, that is something
[18:55.950 --> 18:59.530]  I recommend you check out because that will correlate very well with what I'm about to
[18:59.530 --> 19:00.530]  say.
[19:00.770 --> 19:08.090]  So Chemdog, all of the Chemdog line was bag seed to be ... If you want to talk about bag
[19:08.090 --> 19:09.090]  seed.
[19:09.090 --> 19:14.210]  So this dude Chem bought some weed and in that weed were seeds and he grew them and
[19:14.210 --> 19:15.570]  he found 13 seeds.
[19:15.570 --> 19:20.570]  Out of those 13 seeds, some were boys, some were females, some he still has.
[19:20.570 --> 19:25.330]  Some of those famous plants that came from that were the original Chemdog, the Chem 91,
[19:25.330 --> 19:27.410]  the Chem D, the Chem Sister.
[19:27.490 --> 19:32.770]  All of those came from that bag of seeds and we are all breeding ... All of the breeders
[19:32.770 --> 19:36.730]  I know, everybody that's bred some stuff is breeding to one of those plants.
[19:36.730 --> 19:40.010]  We're breeding with one of those because that shit is fire.
[19:40.010 --> 19:45.110]  The only thing we know about it, since it got so popular and since cannabis culture
[19:45.110 --> 19:48.650]  has blossomed and developed, we know a lot more about it.
[19:48.650 --> 19:50.110]  We don't know the exact genetics.
[19:50.110 --> 19:52.650]  We know that a guy named ... I know his real name.
[19:52.650 --> 19:53.650]  I almost said it.
[19:53.650 --> 19:54.650]  Sorry, bro.
[19:54.650 --> 19:55.650]  I almost said your real name.
[19:55.890 --> 20:00.890]  Chem got some weed from some guys in Colorado and those guys called the weed the dog bud.
[20:00.890 --> 20:04.770]  They called it the Chemweed because it smelled like chemicals and when you smoked it, it
[20:04.770 --> 20:06.330]  would make you roll over like a dog.
[20:06.330 --> 20:10.330]  So one guy called it dogweed, the other guy called it Chemweed.
[20:10.330 --> 20:12.350]  These guys met up at a Grateful Dead concert.
[20:12.350 --> 20:14.930]  They traded some of it later on.
[20:14.930 --> 20:17.170]  Chemdog got home and he called them and he's like, can you send me more?
[20:17.170 --> 20:18.810]  They mailed more of it from Colorado.
[20:18.810 --> 20:19.850]  Chem found seeds in it.
[20:19.850 --> 20:21.690]  That's basically ... Well, that's the story.
[20:21.690 --> 20:27.370]  The other guys don't know the origin, genetics, lineage or history of these plants, allegedly,
[20:27.370 --> 20:28.930]  possibly, maybe.
[20:28.930 --> 20:30.890]  So that's bag seed at that point.
[20:30.890 --> 20:34.490]  When Chemdog got it and started breeding with it, it was just bag seed, but he knew the
[20:34.490 --> 20:36.890]  weed it came from was fucking fire.
[20:36.890 --> 20:38.250]  So that's all he had to go on.
[20:38.250 --> 20:40.570]  Then he grew the plants.
[20:40.570 --> 20:43.770]  Once the plants were grown, some of them were amazing.
[20:43.770 --> 20:48.610]  That's why we all know Chemdog, ChemD, Chem91, Chem Sister.
[20:48.610 --> 20:49.610]  We've all smoked.
[20:49.610 --> 20:50.810]  Most of us have smoked all of those.
[20:50.930 --> 20:55.410]  If you're in an area where cannabis has any sort of legalization, you've probably smoked
[20:55.410 --> 20:59.090]  those or something that somebody grew and tried to tell you was that.
[20:59.090 --> 21:03.010]  But they're really prolific and dominant strains in the cannabis industry.
[21:03.010 --> 21:05.810]  So we've all ... And a lot of the breeders have gotten their hands on them too.
[21:05.810 --> 21:09.570]  Once you see a plant like that and you grow it and you smoke it, you know that is something
[21:09.570 --> 21:10.570]  you want to breed to.
[21:10.570 --> 21:12.810]  Just like, pick my King Solomon.
[21:12.810 --> 21:15.030]  When I saw that, I was like, that's the dude right there.
[21:15.030 --> 21:16.450]  That's the guy to breed to.
[21:16.450 --> 21:20.250]  Then when I saw Strawberry Starburst, I was like, that needs some pollen on it.
[21:20.890 --> 21:21.970]  It's a breeder intuition.
[21:21.970 --> 21:26.530]  So the question is, how do you breed to it without knowing the genetics or anything?
[21:26.530 --> 21:27.530]  You don't need to know.
[21:27.530 --> 21:29.010]  It's really cool to know the history.
[21:29.010 --> 21:30.930]  It feels really nice.
[21:30.930 --> 21:31.930]  It feels good.
[21:31.930 --> 21:34.590]  It's a lot of cool details, but you don't need to know that.
[21:34.590 --> 21:39.570]  We were breeding plants and crossing cannabis plants long before we knew all this fancy
[21:39.570 --> 21:40.570]  stuff.
[21:40.570 --> 21:41.570]  A lot of us are spoiled now.
[21:41.570 --> 21:45.890]  The new generation ... I'm a little bit older than a lot of the youngsters out there, but
[21:45.890 --> 21:49.810]  I am also part of the internet generation where I'm freaking spoiled, where I could
[21:49.810 --> 21:54.250]  go on the internet and type in, I want to find these cannabis seeds at 45 websites.
[21:54.250 --> 21:55.770]  It'll come up and I can order them.
[21:55.770 --> 22:00.090]  Luckily, I've got a couple of friends in the seed industry, so I could get basically whatever
[22:00.090 --> 22:02.790]  seeds I'm searching for, but we're spoiled now.
[22:02.790 --> 22:05.090]  Back in the day, you had to get whatever seeds you got.
[22:05.090 --> 22:07.770]  If you got some bag seeds, you had to accept those and grow them.
[22:07.770 --> 22:10.090]  If you got some clones, you just had to hope they were good.
[22:10.090 --> 22:12.530]  Whoever selected those clones did a good job for you.
[22:12.530 --> 22:15.290]  Now, we're freaking spoiled.
[22:15.290 --> 22:16.650]  The answer is, just do it, bro.
[22:16.650 --> 22:19.010]  If the plants look amazing, if they have the traits you want.
[22:19.210 --> 22:20.210]  It's all about observation.
[22:20.210 --> 22:24.650]  It's all about knowing what traits you're looking for, knowing the goal, having a goal,
[22:24.650 --> 22:27.250]  understanding the plant, understanding pairing.
[22:27.250 --> 22:28.530]  What plants are you going to put that to?
[22:28.530 --> 22:30.370]  What does this plant offer in a mix?
[22:30.370 --> 22:32.650]  How are you going to complement the other plants?
[22:32.650 --> 22:33.650]  What are you going to do?
[22:33.650 --> 22:38.210]  Then, of course, growing them out and testing the offspring is another big part of it.
[22:38.210 --> 22:42.210]  By not knowing the lineage and genetics, how do you start breeding from it?
[22:42.210 --> 22:44.290]  Throw some pollen on it, bro, and see what it does.
[22:44.290 --> 22:45.530]  That's the best way to do it.
[22:45.570 --> 22:49.570]  That's one of the funnest things about breeding and growing weed, just seeing what the outcome
[22:49.570 --> 22:51.850]  is after you do some crazy shit.
[22:51.850 --> 22:53.610]  All right, my dude.
[22:53.610 --> 22:55.130]  Thank you for the great message.
[22:55.130 --> 22:58.250]  Big shout out to my friend, Wicked Nugs, for the good question.
[22:58.250 --> 23:01.850]  If you have any questions, corrections, concerns, or follow-ups, I'd love to hear from you.
[23:01.850 --> 23:04.010]  Of course, you've got the email address.
[23:04.010 --> 23:06.090]  Let's jump into one more email.
[23:06.090 --> 23:08.890]  This one comes from my friend, Buzzards Bay.
[23:08.890 --> 23:10.410]  Shout out to Buzzards Bay.
[23:10.410 --> 23:12.450]  It says, it's been a long time.
[23:12.450 --> 23:13.450]  It's been a long time, bro.
[23:13.450 --> 23:14.810]  You know I'm coming up in May.
[23:14.850 --> 23:16.170]  It says, it's Buzzards Bay.
[23:16.170 --> 23:18.530]  I'm glad to see your success on the podcast.
[23:18.530 --> 23:19.530]  Thank you, brother.
[23:19.530 --> 23:21.890]  We're almost to 750 episodes, you guys.
[23:21.890 --> 23:24.650]  It says, come a long way since a couple of years ago.
[23:24.650 --> 23:26.650]  Yes, thank you for noticing.
[23:26.650 --> 23:29.130]  We're doing 4K video.
[23:29.130 --> 23:33.170]  Sometimes it's multi-cam when both cams want to cooperate, when I feel like fucking with
[23:33.170 --> 23:34.170]  both of them.
[23:34.170 --> 23:36.810]  Sometimes I just want to smash camera two right onto the floor, but we're going to keep
[23:36.810 --> 23:39.210]  the vibes positive here.
[23:39.210 --> 23:43.210]  It says, anyway, I had a quick question about male selection.
[23:43.210 --> 23:45.730]  I can answer this question really thoroughly.
[23:45.730 --> 23:50.170]  When you make regular seeds and you find a male you really like, do you have clones of
[23:50.170 --> 23:55.530]  that male as a backup, or is that male used once and then you find a new male to work
[23:55.530 --> 23:56.530]  with?
[23:56.530 --> 24:01.290]  For example, when you discuss King Solomon, do you have a backup clone of him?
[24:01.290 --> 24:02.290]  Thanks in advance.
[24:02.290 --> 24:04.330]  Stay iry, my bro.
[24:04.330 --> 24:06.890]  Peace, excuse me for burping in the middle of your message.
[24:06.890 --> 24:08.610]  Peace from Buzzards Bay.
[24:08.610 --> 24:11.050]  Buzzards Bay, thank you for the great question.
[24:11.050 --> 24:13.290]  A lot of you may not know, a lot of you may know.
[24:13.290 --> 24:18.090]  I'm the head breeder, the sole proprietor of Iry Genetics Premium Seeds, and I do make
[24:18.090 --> 24:19.090]  a lot of seeds.
[24:19.090 --> 24:22.410]  You may know, you may have heard about my male plant known as King Solomon.
[24:22.410 --> 24:24.850]  It is an Arise F1 male.
[24:24.850 --> 24:27.130]  I've named him King Solomon.
[24:27.130 --> 24:30.170]  If you research King Solomon, you'll get the joke behind that.
[24:30.170 --> 24:32.190]  King Solomon makes a lot of plants.
[24:32.190 --> 24:37.450]  Our friend Buzzards Bay is asking, do I keep a mother plant or a father plant, if you will,
[24:37.450 --> 24:42.730]  of King Solomon, or do I find a new one every time, or do I have clones of backups?
[24:42.730 --> 24:44.330]  Now that's a really good question.
[24:44.330 --> 24:46.250]  Here is honestly how I do it.
[24:46.250 --> 24:49.250]  I do keep a plant of King Solomon all the time.
[24:49.250 --> 24:52.050]  I've got one main mother plant that I keep.
[24:52.050 --> 24:53.050]  It's a father plant, I guess.
[24:53.050 --> 24:57.170]  It stays in a five-gallon pot right under the middle of all the lights in the bedroom
[24:57.170 --> 24:58.170]  or in the mother room.
[24:58.170 --> 24:59.170]  That is where he chills.
[24:59.170 --> 25:01.450]  That is King Solomon's spot.
[25:01.450 --> 25:02.450]  He'll get big.
[25:02.450 --> 25:03.450]  He'll get bushy.
[25:03.450 --> 25:07.530]  As soon as he's big enough to start giving me a few clones, because I re-clone him every
[25:07.530 --> 25:08.530]  so often.
[25:08.530 --> 25:09.530]  I talk about that occasionally.
[25:09.530 --> 25:11.210]  I'll start growing him.
[25:11.210 --> 25:12.410]  I'll get a fresh clone of him.
[25:12.410 --> 25:13.770]  Let's just say I just cut brand new clones.
[25:13.770 --> 25:16.370]  I got a brand new clone of King Solomon.
[25:16.370 --> 25:17.730]  Put him into a pot, grow him up.
[25:17.730 --> 25:21.730]  As soon as he's big enough to give me a cut, I take another cut.
[25:21.730 --> 25:23.130]  Then I put that one in a smaller pot.
[25:23.130 --> 25:24.130]  They just keep going.
[25:24.130 --> 25:28.690]  I've always got one or two of King Solomon around just to keep that one alive, just because
[25:28.690 --> 25:29.690]  that's my gem.
[25:29.690 --> 25:34.370]  I've always got him around, at least the big one, probably one or two other copies
[25:34.370 --> 25:36.850]  of him as well.
[25:36.850 --> 25:41.650]  If I need clones for breeding from him, I generally take them from the biggest plant.
[25:41.650 --> 25:44.730]  I'll just go grab a few off the biggest one, because that one's getting big.
[25:44.730 --> 25:47.450]  It's going to have to get cut down or do something with it eventually.
[25:47.450 --> 25:51.010]  I'll go get as many clones as I need, and then I'll grow those out, throw those into
[25:51.010 --> 25:54.290]  the flower room so I can make my pollen happen there.
[25:54.290 --> 25:56.250]  Then when that one gets too big, cut him down.
[25:56.250 --> 25:58.810]  Let the next plant keep going.
[25:58.930 --> 26:03.090]  I keep one big father plant for approximately three to six months, depending on how big
[26:03.090 --> 26:05.210]  he gets and how many cuts I need.
[26:05.210 --> 26:10.730]  It's a male, so I generally only need two clones of him at any time, plus a backup,
[26:10.730 --> 26:11.730]  plus the mom.
[26:11.730 --> 26:13.410]  That's how I do it.
[26:13.410 --> 26:16.930]  I keep one big plant, and I cut clones off that as needed.
[26:16.930 --> 26:21.610]  Then about every once or twice a year, I cut him down and start him over and give him a
[26:21.610 --> 26:25.370]  fresh ... cut a bunch of clones and keep the best two as the brand new starters.
[26:25.410 --> 26:28.930]  I wouldn't want to try to start again from seed every time, because I know that King
[26:28.930 --> 26:30.290]  Solomon's reliable.
[26:30.290 --> 26:32.090]  Finding a male is a struggle.
[26:32.090 --> 26:33.090]  Maybe not a struggle.
[26:33.090 --> 26:34.090]  It takes a lot of time.
[26:34.090 --> 26:35.090]  It takes a lot of effort.
[26:35.090 --> 26:36.090]  It's a project.
[26:36.090 --> 26:37.690]  It's a real ... it's work.
[26:37.690 --> 26:40.130]  Finding that male, I have to grow out seeds.
[26:40.130 --> 26:41.490]  I have to eliminate the females.
[26:41.490 --> 26:44.010]  I got to find the dudes that have the traits I want.
[26:44.010 --> 26:46.810]  Then I got to audition those and narrow them down.
[26:46.810 --> 26:49.250]  Once I've chosen what I like, then I have to pollinate stuff.
[26:49.250 --> 26:50.810]  Then I have to grow that out.
[26:50.810 --> 26:52.730]  It's a big process, choosing a male.
[26:52.810 --> 26:55.610]  I definitely try to keep the same dude around.
[26:55.610 --> 26:57.570]  There is a Jack the Ripper male.
[26:57.570 --> 26:59.010]  There's an Arise male.
[26:59.010 --> 27:01.510]  Of course, there's the BC Lemon Skunk male.
[27:01.510 --> 27:07.010]  Those are all kept around in big pots in different areas, different locations, so that the pollen
[27:07.010 --> 27:09.930]  never gets crossed anywhere.
[27:09.930 --> 27:11.130]  The males are in different places.
[27:11.130 --> 27:15.010]  That way we know that there's never ... I call it the Maury Povich situation.
[27:15.010 --> 27:18.010]  We always know who the baby daddy is in iRegenetics.
[27:18.010 --> 27:21.490]  All right, my buddy Buzzer, thank you for the great question.
[27:21.490 --> 27:23.290]  That is all I've got for you guys for this episode.
[27:23.290 --> 27:28.690]  I want to thank you again for listening to episode 747 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[27:28.690 --> 27:30.610]  Hope you enjoyed the show as much as I did.
[27:30.610 --> 27:33.010]  You know I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[27:33.010 --> 27:37.170]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, make sure you send me an email.
[27:37.170 --> 27:40.210]  The email address is, of course, growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[27:40.210 --> 27:41.530]  Don't be shy.
[27:41.530 --> 27:46.130]  Anything else you may need is on my website at iRegenetics.com.
[27:46.130 --> 27:47.690]  There's a link to the Discord.
[27:47.690 --> 27:48.690]  There are vendor links.
[27:48.690 --> 27:49.970]  There's a merch link.
[27:49.970 --> 27:52.210]  There's a way to sign up for a mailing list on there.
[27:52.210 --> 27:54.530]  Also, there's a link to the Discord server.
[27:54.530 --> 27:56.570]  Make sure you check out the Discord server.
[27:56.570 --> 27:59.290]  Don't miss the party happening on the Discord.
[27:59.290 --> 28:01.050]  I hope to see you there.
[28:01.050 --> 28:02.050]  That's all I've got for you.
[28:02.050 --> 28:03.770]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[28:03.770 --> 28:07.250]  I want to give a big shout out to my friend Ronzel.
[28:07.250 --> 28:10.490]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
