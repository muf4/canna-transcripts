[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Okay, I'm ready to start.
[00:02.000 --> 00:07.000]  No Mount Nebraska, yeah you know we smoke so much
[00:07.000 --> 00:13.000]  Fucking No Mount Nebraska, yeah I hate it so much
[00:13.000 --> 00:18.000]  It's so goddamn lame when I buy some hash
[00:18.000 --> 00:26.000]  And that shit don't melt, it just turns into a black biscuit on the nail
[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  Talking about No Mount Nebraska
[00:30.000 --> 00:33.000]  No Mount Nebraska
[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  Got that No Mount Nebraska, yeah you know we got so much
[00:40.000 --> 00:47.000]  Fucking No Mount fucking Nebraska
[00:47.000 --> 00:50.000]  No Mount Nebraska
[00:51.000 --> 00:55.000]  We got that No Mount Nebraska, yeah
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  We've got that fucking big jar of No Mount Nebraska
[01:05.000 --> 01:07.000]  No Mount Nebraska
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  Got that No Mount Nebraska
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  I've got to fucking get rid of all of this No Mount Nebraska
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  No Mount Nebraska
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  It just makes me sick, I just want to get rid of all of this
[01:31.000 --> 01:32.000]  Get rid of it
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.000]  Somebody please take my No Mount Nebraska
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  No Mount Nebraska
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  No Mount Nebraska, yeah
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.660]  No Mount Nebraska
[01:55.660 --> 01:58.660]  This PSA has been brought to you by the great boys at Terpex
[01:58.660 --> 02:01.660]  You can catch them on iTunes under Terpy Boys
[02:01.660 --> 02:04.660]  Their new album will be out soon, No Mount Nebraska, keep it terpy
[02:04.660 --> 02:07.660]  I'm just going to start the show with that, usually I've got an intro song and shit
[02:07.660 --> 02:10.660]  I'm just going to roll with it from right there, that was awesome
[02:10.660 --> 02:15.660]  I'm really excited that you had that recorded because I'm going to use that in our store
[02:15.660 --> 02:17.660]  I'm going to play that in the butter room
[02:17.660 --> 02:20.660]  That means you're going to play my podcast a lot because it's the only version of it that will be available
[02:20.660 --> 02:22.660]  You're only going to let me have that one I bet
[02:23.660 --> 02:24.660]  That was awesome
[02:24.660 --> 02:29.660]  Wow, welcome to the show everybody, I'm flabbergasted and thrown off pace by that
[02:29.660 --> 02:32.660]  But that's the greatest way to start a podcast ever
[02:32.660 --> 02:35.660]  That's pretty much how you've got to do it in life, you've got to do something unexpected
[02:35.660 --> 02:41.660]  You didn't know my boys had voices like that, that's like true sirens of the 710 world
[02:41.660 --> 02:45.660]  I'm kind of turned on, you know, I've got all kinds of emotions going on over here
[02:45.660 --> 02:47.660]  I did not want it to stop, at all, ever
[02:47.660 --> 02:48.660]  The only thing we want to stop
[02:48.660 --> 02:51.660]  Hey man, we could do that for about four hours and we haven't done it before
[02:51.660 --> 02:54.660]  We'll do the outro for four hours, we'll just do that
[02:54.660 --> 02:57.660]  We've got our special bread song
[02:57.660 --> 02:58.660]  Special bread song?
[02:58.660 --> 03:04.660]  It's a new strain, you know, exclusive genetics, you know, it's called the bread
[03:04.660 --> 03:05.660]  The bread, the bread
[03:05.660 --> 03:06.660]  Do I want to know the cross?
[03:06.660 --> 03:08.660]  It's a secret
[03:08.660 --> 03:09.660]  It's a secret, that's what I say
[03:09.660 --> 03:12.660]  I will say before we get off topic, we do want to make sure we say
[03:12.660 --> 03:16.660]  We need to end the no melt in Nebraska
[03:16.660 --> 03:18.660]  Like the Nebraska needs to stop in this state
[03:18.660 --> 03:21.660]  People just need to stop making no melt in Nebraska
[03:21.660 --> 03:23.660]  Yeah, it's not about the no melt, it's about the melt
[03:23.660 --> 03:24.660]  Get back on the J-mic
[03:24.660 --> 03:25.660]  Thank you
[03:25.660 --> 03:26.660]  Get back on the J-mic
[03:26.660 --> 03:27.660]  It's all about the J-mic
[03:27.660 --> 03:30.660]  We're going to need to make a glossary of terms to go with the podcast
[03:30.660 --> 03:32.660]  But if you're not with it, you're not with it today guys
[03:32.660 --> 03:35.660]  So basically let me explain what no melt Nebraska is, let's start it off with that
[03:35.660 --> 03:36.660]  Well let's introduce you before you explain
[03:36.660 --> 03:41.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, speaking on the mic right now that is about to give us a lesson in no melt Nebraska
[03:41.660 --> 03:42.660]  Is Jordan from Terpex
[03:42.660 --> 03:44.660]  If you don't know about Terpex, you've got to find out
[03:44.660 --> 03:48.660]  I have been dabbing mad Terpex for the past 2 or 3 weeks
[03:48.660 --> 03:52.660]  And Terpex has put a smile on my face, I just dabbed some chem dog nectar
[03:52.660 --> 03:53.660]  I'm lit up
[03:53.660 --> 03:55.660]  So alright, here I'm going to turn it back over to Jordan
[03:55.660 --> 03:57.660]  No melt Nebraska, let's hear it again
[03:57.660 --> 04:03.660]  Okay so no melt Nebraska is basically any hash that doesn't melt, essentially
[04:03.660 --> 04:04.660]  You know what I mean?
[04:04.660 --> 04:09.660]  Because basically if you were to imagine making hash in Nebraska
[04:09.660 --> 04:11.660]  It would be not melting
[04:11.660 --> 04:13.660]  Most of it would probably not be very good
[04:13.660 --> 04:17.660]  I think it was just we were thinking where's the state that has the least melty hash
[04:17.660 --> 04:19.660]  Yeah I think that is exactly where it came from
[04:19.660 --> 04:21.660]  It would be in Nebraska
[04:21.660 --> 04:25.660]  It is true, it's about the hash that doesn't melt, you just call it Nebraska
[04:25.660 --> 04:31.660]  And then the song was derived when my friend Jordan here came home with a bunch of no melt Nebraska
[04:31.660 --> 04:37.660]  Yeah I had someone come down, back when we lived in Northern California
[04:37.660 --> 04:44.660]  Came down from Mendocino, was talking for weeks about this awesome amazing granddaddy bubble hash
[04:44.660 --> 04:46.660]  That he was going to be bringing down
[04:46.660 --> 04:48.660]  And let me tell you, when he brought that down
[04:48.660 --> 04:53.660]  Turned into straight biscuits on the nail
[04:53.660 --> 04:55.660]  So you drop it on the nail and instead of getting a bubble you just get
[04:55.660 --> 04:57.660]  No nothing really happens
[04:57.660 --> 04:59.660]  You get the funnion
[04:59.660 --> 05:01.660]  Yeah it just kind of sits there
[05:01.660 --> 05:02.660]  Funnion, the flavored funnion
[05:02.660 --> 05:05.660]  Goes to a light brown, you don't really get any smoke in the piece or anything
[05:05.660 --> 05:07.660]  You're just like burnt
[05:07.660 --> 05:09.660]  The face I'm making does not convey on radio at all
[05:09.660 --> 05:12.660]  But I'm making this face, like if you've ever smelled burnt hair
[05:12.660 --> 05:14.660]  I'm making the face that happens when you smell burnt hair
[05:14.660 --> 05:16.660]  Our buddy John John just walked in
[05:16.660 --> 05:18.660]  He's getting
[05:18.660 --> 05:22.660]  Randy Randall Jr.
[05:22.660 --> 05:24.660]  I fucking love this group of people
[05:24.660 --> 05:26.660]  Shout out
[05:26.660 --> 05:28.660]  So I've got a dab for you over here also
[05:28.660 --> 05:30.660]  Double dabbing
[05:30.660 --> 05:32.660]  That full melt dab, or mostly melt dab
[05:32.660 --> 05:34.660]  Kind of melt
[05:34.660 --> 05:38.660]  I will say this for everybody, if you don't understand all of the verbiage and nomenclatures going on today
[05:38.660 --> 05:42.660]  Definitely write in to the Grow From Your Heart podcast and ask for a definition
[05:42.660 --> 05:46.660]  Well my name's Richard and I don't understand what that nomenclature word is that you just said
[05:46.660 --> 05:48.660]  And frankly I'm offended
[05:48.660 --> 05:50.660]  Not everybody can be on the level
[05:50.660 --> 05:52.660]  I'm pretty sure it's verbiage, not verbiage
[05:52.660 --> 05:54.660]  Verbiage?
[05:54.660 --> 05:56.660]  It's verbiage
[05:56.660 --> 05:58.660]  There's a, uh, verbiage
[05:58.660 --> 06:00.660]  I stand corrected
[06:00.660 --> 06:02.660]  Alright Captain Grammar
[06:02.660 --> 06:04.660]  That's the nature boy Ric Flair
[06:04.660 --> 06:06.660]  To my mostly left over here, I'm gonna say what's that like 11 o'clock
[06:06.660 --> 06:08.660]  You about the 1130 position over there?
[06:08.660 --> 06:10.660]  I'd like to say, you know
[06:10.660 --> 06:12.660]  I'm gonna give you 1130 because that's 420 plus 710
[06:12.660 --> 06:14.660]  That is my buddy Hunt, that's the grimy gaffy over there
[06:14.660 --> 06:16.660]  How you doing brother?
[06:16.660 --> 06:18.660]  I am ecstatic to finally be on the podcast
[06:18.660 --> 06:20.660]  It's so great
[06:20.660 --> 06:22.660]  Months of fucking talking about it and getting called out by my boy
[06:22.660 --> 06:24.660]  Irie for not listening
[06:24.660 --> 06:26.660]  And trying to listen and playing it at our shop
[06:26.660 --> 06:28.660]  And doing everything, I finally am fucking here
[06:28.660 --> 06:30.660]  Spitting grammar on the mic
[06:30.660 --> 06:32.660]  And verbiage
[06:32.660 --> 06:34.660]  I'm actually here, I am the Terp Manch
[06:34.660 --> 06:36.660]  I'm in the Terp Mansion, I call it the Terpy Trap House
[06:36.660 --> 06:38.660]  Yeah it's kind of a pig sty
[06:38.660 --> 06:40.660]  No you haven't been to my house
[06:40.660 --> 06:42.660]  I've invaded their dining area
[06:42.660 --> 06:44.660]  I stepped on their dog
[06:44.660 --> 06:46.660]  I've made myself home here
[06:46.660 --> 06:48.660]  He literally just walked in
[06:48.660 --> 06:50.660]  Kicked the dog, grabbed the e-mail
[06:50.660 --> 06:52.660]  Set up a mic
[06:52.660 --> 06:54.660]  The dog was asking for a kickin' dude
[06:54.660 --> 06:56.660]  That dog came right back and tried to hump your ass
[06:56.660 --> 06:58.660]  I just want everybody to know
[06:58.660 --> 07:00.660]  He likes it rough man
[07:00.660 --> 07:02.660]  He probably smelled the ham wallet
[07:02.660 --> 07:04.660]  Oh you had to sneak in the word ham wallet
[07:04.660 --> 07:06.660]  Do you get points for that?
[07:06.660 --> 07:08.660]  I got a couple
[07:08.660 --> 07:10.660]  Ham wallet, two of them
[07:10.660 --> 07:12.660]  Spitting Viper
[07:12.660 --> 07:14.660]  This is going to be a grimy show
[07:14.660 --> 07:16.660]  That's why we brought our friend the Grimy Gatsby
[07:16.660 --> 07:18.660]  They only bring me for a reason, and that's to not act my age
[07:18.660 --> 07:20.660]  You set this up, this is your fault that all this chaos is here
[07:20.660 --> 07:22.660]  And I appreciate it man, thanks a lot
[07:22.660 --> 07:24.660]  And I'm also going to give a huge shameless plug to
[07:24.660 --> 07:26.660]  Green and Healthy Cannabis on 212 South 21st Street
[07:26.660 --> 07:28.660]  In Colorado Springs
[07:28.660 --> 07:30.660]  How much love
[07:30.660 --> 07:32.660]  I know I do work for a dispensary right in Pueblo
[07:32.660 --> 07:34.660]  But they don't have the Terp X
[07:34.660 --> 07:36.660]  And I come up to Green and Healthy Cannabis to get the Terp X
[07:36.660 --> 07:38.660]  And also the Shula
[07:38.660 --> 07:40.660]  Oh yeah
[07:40.660 --> 07:42.660]  That Shula is raw
[07:42.660 --> 07:44.660]  From Shula
[07:44.660 --> 07:46.660]  If you're ever in Colorado Springs
[07:46.660 --> 07:48.660]  212 South 21st Street
[07:48.660 --> 07:50.660]  In between Colorado
[07:50.660 --> 07:52.660]  And Cimarron
[07:52.660 --> 07:54.660]  We're always there waiting for you
[07:54.660 --> 07:56.660]  Come on through
[07:56.660 --> 07:58.660]  Ample parking
[07:58.660 --> 08:00.660]  John John's a sweet dude
[08:00.660 --> 08:02.660]  He'll hook you up real good
[08:02.660 --> 08:04.660]  Good timing dude
[08:04.660 --> 08:06.660]  Right on for showing up right as we started the show
[08:06.660 --> 08:08.660]  Yeah it wasn't a great timing
[08:08.660 --> 08:10.660]  I tried to stall to wait for you
[08:10.660 --> 08:12.660]  But then that song happened
[08:12.660 --> 08:14.660]  The song just lured me in
[08:14.660 --> 08:16.660]  You got called in by the song
[08:16.660 --> 08:18.660]  I'm wondering if I can put this guitar away
[08:18.660 --> 08:20.660]  No man you gotta keep that out
[08:20.660 --> 08:22.660]  Since you're playing the guitar
[08:22.660 --> 08:24.660]  Introduce yourself
[08:24.660 --> 08:26.660]  These guys just merged out of the video game room a few minutes ago
[08:26.660 --> 08:28.660]  They're like oh shit you got a real podcast
[08:28.660 --> 08:30.660]  And they came and joined the show
[08:30.660 --> 08:32.660]  GG Fam is thick and thorough bro
[08:32.660 --> 08:34.660]  I love it, well welcome to the crew
[08:34.660 --> 08:36.660]  I'm Daniel with Turpex
[08:36.660 --> 08:38.660]  Glad to be here on the show tonight
[08:38.660 --> 08:40.660]  I'm the one they call Flare
[08:40.660 --> 08:42.660]  Are you like Rick Flare?
[08:42.660 --> 08:44.660]  Like that Flare?
[08:44.660 --> 08:46.660]  Yeah I'm like that Flare
[08:46.660 --> 08:48.660]  He's like the nature boy
[08:48.660 --> 08:50.660]  Like throwing figure fours on them boy
[08:50.660 --> 08:52.660]  Alright dawg
[08:52.660 --> 08:54.660]  I'm over to smoking a blunt
[08:54.660 --> 08:56.660]  I barely smoke blunts
[08:56.660 --> 08:58.660]  Happens when you're in the trap house
[08:58.660 --> 09:00.660]  Sometimes you gotta take it back to 16 you know
[09:00.660 --> 09:02.660]  Man we're gonna get lit up
[09:02.660 --> 09:04.660]  Joints, blunts, dabs
[09:04.660 --> 09:06.660]  Gonna be a great podcast
[09:06.660 --> 09:08.660]  Hunt wrote down a few topics
[09:08.660 --> 09:10.660]  He's gonna be the OCD guy in the group most of the time
[09:10.660 --> 09:12.660]  I wish I could read your writing dude
[09:12.660 --> 09:14.660]  You wanna hit my inhaler?
[09:14.660 --> 09:16.660]  Beat you all to it
[09:16.660 --> 09:18.660]  Yeah so Hunt is
[09:18.660 --> 09:20.660]  You know that's another topic
[09:20.660 --> 09:22.660]  Hunt was recently diagnosed with asthma
[09:22.660 --> 09:24.660]  How's that going for you?
[09:24.660 --> 09:26.660]  I can't walk upstairs that fast
[09:26.660 --> 09:28.660]  Dude I know
[09:28.660 --> 09:30.660]  Temporary asthma with bronchitis right now
[09:30.660 --> 09:32.660]  I gotta take off all the fucking pieces and shit
[09:32.660 --> 09:34.660]  That sounds like a hand wallet problem
[09:34.660 --> 09:36.660]  Definitely part of the spinning viper club
[09:36.660 --> 09:38.660]  Is your hand wallet getting a little sandy and rough?
[09:38.660 --> 09:40.660]  Not anymore
[09:40.660 --> 09:42.660]  It got dehydrated
[09:42.660 --> 09:44.660]  I was wheezing
[09:44.660 --> 09:46.660]  I was wheezing in coffee
[09:46.660 --> 09:48.660]  All those notes
[09:48.660 --> 09:50.660]  Dude you were up in a helicopter
[09:50.660 --> 09:52.660]  Jumping out of a helicopter onto a 1400 foot mountain
[09:52.660 --> 09:54.660]  On skis
[09:54.660 --> 09:56.660]  1400?
[09:56.660 --> 09:58.660]  Yeah I was
[09:58.660 --> 10:00.660]  You're right
[10:00.660 --> 10:02.660]  It's only 1200 feet high
[10:02.660 --> 10:04.660]  I'm from Ohio but I think it's higher than that
[10:06.660 --> 10:08.660]  Yeah I was just in Silverton like two weeks ago
[10:08.660 --> 10:10.660]  Doing a bunch of heli drops and skiing
[10:10.660 --> 10:12.660]  13,000 foot cliffs
[10:12.660 --> 10:14.660]  With bronchitis
[10:14.660 --> 10:16.660]  Yeah I had acute bronchitis at that point
[10:16.660 --> 10:18.660]  Still jumping out of the heli and getting down
[10:18.660 --> 10:20.660]  Still taking dabs
[10:20.660 --> 10:22.660]  Whatever you did last week you're a pussy
[10:22.660 --> 10:24.660]  My buddy Hunt was on top of a 14,000 foot mountain
[10:24.660 --> 10:26.660]  Jumping out of a helicopter on skis
[10:26.660 --> 10:28.660]  And now he has asthma
[10:30.660 --> 10:32.660]  Don't try this at home
[10:32.660 --> 10:34.660]  He's hitting an inhaler
[10:34.660 --> 10:36.660]  He does 3 or 4 dabs and goes to the inhaler
[10:36.660 --> 10:38.660]  That's kind of cheating bro
[10:38.660 --> 10:40.660]  I want you to live
[10:40.660 --> 10:42.660]  Can I hit that boy?
[10:42.660 --> 10:44.660]  I can hit that Arbutinol OG player
[10:44.660 --> 10:46.660]  As long as you feel good
[10:46.660 --> 10:48.660]  Does it help you out?
[10:48.660 --> 10:50.660]  Definitely
[10:50.660 --> 10:52.660]  Lace up another fucking hot nail for me
[10:52.660 --> 10:54.660]  Alright Mark Wahlberg
[10:54.660 --> 10:56.660]  Mark Wahlberg is coming in later right?
[10:56.660 --> 10:58.660]  I hope so
[10:58.660 --> 11:00.660]  Since you invited me here I want to definitely make sure to take some time
[11:00.660 --> 11:02.660]  To rep all your companies
[11:02.660 --> 11:04.660]  I know you're with the Grimy Gatsby
[11:04.660 --> 11:06.660]  Give me a couple seconds to hype up the Gatsby
[11:08.660 --> 11:10.660]  I own a company called Grimy Gatsby
[11:10.660 --> 11:12.660]  Thegrimygatsby.com
[11:12.660 --> 11:14.660]  If you want to check it out it's a media and lifestyle website
[11:16.660 --> 11:18.660]  Since that's been started years ago
[11:18.660 --> 11:20.660]  There's now a large portfolio of awesome people
[11:20.660 --> 11:22.660]  And brands that make up a gigantic network
[11:22.660 --> 11:24.660]  All across the country
[11:24.660 --> 11:26.660]  Green and Healthy Wellness
[11:26.660 --> 11:28.660]  Dispensary
[11:28.660 --> 11:30.660]  Apothecana
[11:30.660 --> 11:32.660]  Apothecana
[11:32.660 --> 11:34.660]  All the dudes in the room
[11:34.660 --> 11:36.660]  The whole Turpex squad
[11:36.660 --> 11:38.660]  I have my own moniker here called The Gatherer
[11:38.660 --> 11:40.660]  With the Turpex crew
[11:40.660 --> 11:42.660]  You brought a party tonight
[11:42.660 --> 11:44.660]  Definitely
[11:44.660 --> 11:46.660]  50-60 people in the other room
[11:46.660 --> 11:48.660]  There's like 34 down here
[11:48.660 --> 11:50.660]  And the VIP is sold out at 50
[11:50.660 --> 11:52.660]  Turpex labor camp
[11:52.660 --> 11:54.660]  They're all just up there packaging grams
[11:54.660 --> 11:56.660]  Is all they're doing
[11:56.660 --> 11:58.660]  The Cannabis Grand Crew
[11:58.660 --> 12:00.660]  Is a big super high echelon
[12:00.660 --> 12:02.660]  Limited to 500 people
[12:02.660 --> 12:04.660]  And it's an event that travels all over the country that I help produce
[12:04.660 --> 12:06.660]  There's Smokey Brand
[12:06.660 --> 12:08.660]  Which is smokey socks and smokey clothing
[12:08.660 --> 12:10.660]  Custom sublimated socks
[12:10.660 --> 12:12.660]  And sublimated clothing
[12:12.660 --> 12:14.660]  Plus knitted stuff
[12:14.660 --> 12:16.660]  And we source stuff for all kinds of unbelievable brands
[12:16.660 --> 12:18.660]  So we can get just about anything we want printed on some socks
[12:18.660 --> 12:20.660]  Anything that you want on a sock
[12:20.660 --> 12:22.660]  Anything you want on a shirt
[12:22.660 --> 12:24.660]  Pretty much anything you want in concentrate form
[12:24.660 --> 12:26.660]  Anything you want in topicals
[12:26.660 --> 12:28.660]  Anything you want on a shelf
[12:28.660 --> 12:30.660]  Anything you need
[12:30.660 --> 12:32.660]  I'm just now working on this 3D printing company
[12:32.660 --> 12:34.660]  That's going to start up in Denver pretty soon
[12:34.660 --> 12:36.660]  So it's kind of like whatever comes through and how we can do it to maximize the whole network
[12:36.660 --> 12:38.660]  I'm going to make a personal request for some Apothecana
[12:38.660 --> 12:40.660]  I've got a friend who
[12:40.660 --> 12:42.660]  She's got bad skin
[12:42.660 --> 12:44.660]  And she would love a cannabis product
[12:44.660 --> 12:46.660]  Or a more organic healthy product
[12:46.660 --> 12:48.660]  So let's get Apothecana on that one
[12:48.660 --> 12:50.660]  Super Salve or Body Butter
[12:50.660 --> 12:52.660]  We have it at the shop
[12:52.660 --> 12:54.660]  I got you
[12:54.660 --> 12:56.660]  It does rashes, irritations, cuts, burns, blisters
[12:56.660 --> 12:58.660]  Any of that kind of stuff
[12:58.660 --> 13:00.660]  Anytime you touch that nail
[13:00.660 --> 13:02.660]  Like a wook would
[13:02.660 --> 13:04.660]  You get that burn on your finger
[13:04.660 --> 13:06.660]  Go stick that sucker in some Apothecana
[13:06.660 --> 13:08.660]  You need a nail, here's a rig for you
[13:08.660 --> 13:10.660]  Shout out to the Mad Rob Rig
[13:10.660 --> 13:12.660]  You asked for a dab a minute ago and I just shined you on it
[13:12.660 --> 13:14.660]  You were just like keep eating time
[13:14.660 --> 13:16.660]  Just keep talking, keep talking
[13:16.660 --> 13:18.660]  We'll give you a dab when I'm ready
[13:18.660 --> 13:20.660]  When you're good, when you say something worth it I'll give you a dab like a reward
[13:20.660 --> 13:22.660]  You're a good dog
[13:22.660 --> 13:24.660]  If you go to the website, follow us on Instagram
[13:24.660 --> 13:26.660]  At Akrami Gatsby
[13:26.660 --> 13:28.660]  It's just a gigantic network of people
[13:28.660 --> 13:30.660]  Much like Irie and Turpex
[13:30.660 --> 13:32.660]  And everything else that we do
[13:32.660 --> 13:34.660]  Trying to be as community based
[13:34.660 --> 13:36.660]  Making sure people are getting forward and being positive
[13:36.660 --> 13:38.660]  There's tons of brands
[13:38.660 --> 13:40.660]  The guys that are in the room are probably the most important ones
[13:40.660 --> 13:42.660]  Because this is how we all make it happen
[13:42.660 --> 13:44.660]  That bread
[13:44.660 --> 13:46.660]  I heard there's just one
[13:48.660 --> 13:50.660]  Can we talk about the key?
[13:50.660 --> 13:52.660]  Does anybody know about the key?
[13:52.660 --> 13:54.660]  Yeah, we can talk about the key
[13:54.660 --> 13:56.660]  In 2010 I started Grimey Gatsby in Aspen
[13:56.660 --> 13:58.660]  And we only have about
[13:58.660 --> 14:00.660]  2500 locals in Aspen
[14:00.660 --> 14:02.660]  Maybe 3000 now, I don't know
[14:02.660 --> 14:04.660]  I've left since then
[14:04.660 --> 14:06.660]  In Aspen it was this thing where all these people always had parties
[14:06.660 --> 14:08.660]  And cool shit happening
[14:08.660 --> 14:10.660]  And for Grimey Gatsby I wanted it to be something special
[14:10.660 --> 14:12.660]  So we would throw a party every week called Gatsby's Garden
[14:12.660 --> 14:14.660]  Shout out, you know, big up all the gro
[14:14.660 --> 14:16.660]  But we would do Gatsby's Garden every Tuesday
[14:16.660 --> 14:18.660]  At a revolving bar
[14:18.660 --> 14:20.660]  And the people that were truly homies
[14:20.660 --> 14:22.660]  And people that were respected
[14:22.660 --> 14:24.660]  We would hook them up with the skull key
[14:24.660 --> 14:26.660]  Open your parchment right by the mic
[14:26.660 --> 14:28.660]  Right by the bike
[14:28.660 --> 14:30.660]  But we had this skull key made that we got like 3000 skull keys
[14:30.660 --> 14:32.660]  And so a lot of the guys in the room
[14:32.660 --> 14:34.660]  All have one of the skull keys
[14:34.660 --> 14:36.660]  But the thought was that the skull key opens up
[14:36.660 --> 14:38.660]  Every single door in the Gatsby mansion
[14:38.660 --> 14:40.660]  And so we would go to all the parties
[14:40.660 --> 14:42.660]  So initially it was started that the bouncers in Aspen
[14:42.660 --> 14:44.660]  If you showed them the key, wouldn't check your ID or make you stand in line
[14:44.660 --> 14:46.660]  So our parties were instantly a little bit more
[14:46.660 --> 14:48.660]  Hoity-toity for the locals
[14:48.660 --> 14:50.660]  Because they could just walk right in and shine off in front of people
[14:50.660 --> 14:52.660]  Since then it's now evolved
[14:52.660 --> 14:54.660]  And people all over the world have this little skull key
[14:54.660 --> 14:56.660]  On their keychain that's a very nice connection point
[14:56.660 --> 14:58.660]  And you know
[14:58.660 --> 15:00.660]  When we have events there's a lot of keys in the room
[15:00.660 --> 15:02.660]  And when the keys are out by themselves
[15:02.660 --> 15:04.660]  At least they know we're all together
[15:04.660 --> 15:06.660]  It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's dope. It's admirable
[15:06.660 --> 15:08.660]  It's a cool little thing. Yeah, it's branding and marketing
[15:08.660 --> 15:10.660]  How does one earn a key?
[15:10.660 --> 15:12.660]  Yeah, where's my key?
[15:12.660 --> 15:14.660]  I wasn't going to ask that but I'm glad they stepped up for me
[15:14.660 --> 15:16.660]  Most of the keys now are only handed out at the dojo
[15:16.660 --> 15:18.660]  Shoes off secret knock
[15:18.660 --> 15:20.660]  Shoes off secret knock
[15:20.660 --> 15:22.660]  Drum circle
[15:22.660 --> 15:24.660]  Famous fam, shoes off secret knock
[15:24.660 --> 15:26.660]  Dojo, temps down, terps up
[15:26.660 --> 15:28.660]  Drum circle
[15:28.660 --> 15:30.660]  Terps down, temps up
[15:30.660 --> 15:32.660]  It was like marketing and branding and this cool little thing that I could do
[15:32.660 --> 15:34.660]  And now it's, you know, I have
[15:34.660 --> 15:36.660]  Broken ones since then and have people send them to me
[15:36.660 --> 15:38.660]  And all kinds of just crazy bullshit
[15:38.660 --> 15:40.660]  So it's cool to like, you know, I think you have a key, right?
[15:40.660 --> 15:42.660]  I do not have a key. Damn. But uh, you'll get one
[15:42.660 --> 15:44.660]  Yeah, I know where the dojo, you know what? I haven't been to your new house, bro
[15:44.660 --> 15:46.660]  You moved and I haven't been there
[15:46.660 --> 15:48.660]  Don't tell nobody. Well, we live a hundred and something miles apart
[15:48.660 --> 15:50.660]  You can come by anytime. We meet up in the springs
[15:50.660 --> 15:52.660]  Shout out to Colorado Springs, you've been super kind to me
[15:52.660 --> 15:54.660]  719
[15:54.660 --> 15:56.660]  Get down on that CO Springs, baby
[15:56.660 --> 15:58.660]  Westside. Coming at ya
[15:58.660 --> 16:00.660]  719
[16:00.660 --> 16:02.660]  Hashtag white people
[16:02.660 --> 16:04.660]  Aliens
[16:04.660 --> 16:06.660]  Hashtag no free time
[16:06.660 --> 16:08.660]  Man, you got
[16:08.660 --> 16:10.660]  Everybody in this room is a social media monster
[16:10.660 --> 16:12.660]  Yeah, for sure. There's a lot of it, right?
[16:12.660 --> 16:14.660]  I mean, everybody likes to get down on that shit
[16:14.660 --> 16:16.660]  You guys, I feel like social media is what brought my
[16:16.660 --> 16:18.660]  My business, you know, I did it on accident
[16:18.660 --> 16:20.660]  I was like, I'm gonna start a little seed company
[16:20.660 --> 16:22.660]  And I put it up on social media
[16:22.660 --> 16:24.660]  And then suddenly it was like, pshh
[16:24.660 --> 16:26.660]  You've got one of the known seed companies on
[16:26.660 --> 16:28.660]  And it was all social media. Do you guys notice that
[16:28.660 --> 16:30.660]  From like being a hash company? Do you guys see that a lot?
[16:30.660 --> 16:32.660]  Instagram's a huge platform
[16:32.660 --> 16:34.660]  How many followers does TerpX have?
[16:34.660 --> 16:36.660]  Just curious
[16:36.660 --> 16:38.660]  21,000
[16:38.660 --> 16:40.660]  That's more than me, I'm probably at
[16:40.660 --> 16:42.660]  13,000 by the time this airs
[16:42.660 --> 16:44.660]  That's still good, that's great
[16:44.660 --> 16:46.660]  We've been building that
[16:46.660 --> 16:48.660]  That number for almost
[16:48.660 --> 16:50.660]  What, two or three years at this point?
[16:50.660 --> 16:52.660]  Yeah, definitely about three years
[16:52.660 --> 16:54.660]  What's the exact TerpX account so they can find it?
[16:54.660 --> 16:56.660]  TerpX Co
[16:56.660 --> 16:58.660]  T-E-R-P-X-C-O
[16:58.660 --> 17:00.660]  Is there an underscore anywhere?
[17:00.660 --> 17:02.660]  Just at TerpX Co, you guys find them
[17:02.660 --> 17:04.660]  Check them out, great hash pictures
[17:04.660 --> 17:06.660]  Also make sure you follow Green and Healthy Cannabis
[17:06.660 --> 17:08.660]  You guys changed that Instagram or something, didn't you?
[17:08.660 --> 17:10.660]  Yeah, we're at
[17:10.660 --> 17:12.660]  Greenandhealthy719
[17:12.660 --> 17:14.660]  Haters gonna hate, man
[17:14.660 --> 17:16.660]  Haters gonna ain't
[17:16.660 --> 17:18.660]  Haters cause they're anus
[17:18.660 --> 17:20.660]  We had three accounts deleted, now we're up to
[17:20.660 --> 17:22.660]  1500
[17:22.660 --> 17:24.660]  How'd you get your accounts deleted?
[17:24.660 --> 17:26.660]  I don't know, man. Instagram's all about that non-life sometimes
[17:26.660 --> 17:28.660]  Please don't do it to me, Instagram
[17:28.660 --> 17:30.660]  I just got a new camera and my picture
[17:30.660 --> 17:32.660]  My game has increased, please don't squish me
[17:32.660 --> 17:34.660]  Speaking of haters, dude
[17:34.660 --> 17:36.660]  You reminded me, you asked me when I got here
[17:36.660 --> 17:38.660]  Why they made me change the name
[17:38.660 --> 17:40.660]  I'll tell you again, cause a lot of people are new to the show
[17:40.660 --> 17:42.660]  It used to be
[17:42.660 --> 17:44.660]  I Grow Culture
[17:44.660 --> 17:46.660]  I Grow Culture, yeah, yeah
[17:46.660 --> 17:48.660]  I grow like based on the iPhone and the iMac
[17:48.660 --> 17:50.660]  And the iCult that it all is, was I Grow Culture
[17:50.660 --> 17:52.660]  Cause you listen on your iPhone
[17:52.660 --> 17:54.660]  But there's an educational entity that does
[17:54.660 --> 17:56.660]  Educational seminars or some kind of shit for colleges
[17:56.660 --> 17:58.660]  Oh, he goes for the inhaler
[17:58.660 --> 18:00.660]  The whole room looked at me like
[18:00.660 --> 18:02.660]  Say something about it, say something about it
[18:02.660 --> 18:04.660]  You all heard it, I know it's recorded
[18:04.660 --> 18:06.660]  Is that that Albuterol? Yeah, that Albuterol OG player
[18:06.660 --> 18:08.660]  Yeah, he's getting all fucked up over there
[18:08.660 --> 18:10.660]  They didn't want me relating cannabis to their organization
[18:10.660 --> 18:12.660]  So they kindly were like
[18:12.660 --> 18:14.660]  Please don't, you know
[18:14.660 --> 18:16.660]  I didn't want to steal someone else's name
[18:16.660 --> 18:18.660]  And we're all growing from our heart here
[18:18.660 --> 18:20.660]  Big ups and respect for that
[18:20.660 --> 18:22.660]  If that's their name, I don't want to steal it
[18:22.660 --> 18:24.660]  I will take it, thanks
[18:24.660 --> 18:26.660]  That new logo is fucking crisp
[18:26.660 --> 18:28.660]  With the readouts, you know, it's good
[18:28.660 --> 18:30.660]  So shout out to a website called Fiverr
[18:30.660 --> 18:32.660]  Some young kid in Bangladesh
[18:32.660 --> 18:34.660]  Made the avatar of me
[18:34.660 --> 18:36.660]  And then another guy in Bangladesh
[18:36.660 --> 18:38.660]  Pieced the two together and made me the logo
[18:38.660 --> 18:40.660]  It was like 40 bucks
[18:40.660 --> 18:42.660]  40 bucks for everything
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.660]  A young kid like you
[18:44.660 --> 18:46.660]  Sounds like all those callers
[18:46.660 --> 18:48.660]  That you get telemarketing or whatever, right?
[18:48.660 --> 18:50.660]  He probably does tech support by day
[18:50.660 --> 18:52.660]  What does someone from Bangladesh even sound like?
[18:52.660 --> 18:54.660]  I was about to look at you
[18:54.660 --> 18:56.660]  And be like, are you going to throw out a Bangladesh accent?
[18:56.660 --> 18:58.660]  And then I did not know how that would happen
[18:58.660 --> 19:00.660]  I was going to, but it was just going to sound like an Indian
[19:00.660 --> 19:02.660]  That's racist
[19:02.660 --> 19:04.660]  We're not racist over here
[19:04.660 --> 19:06.660]  I think we already got racist just by talking about the cheap labor wages
[19:06.660 --> 19:08.660]  We're not racist over here
[19:08.660 --> 19:10.660]  You're the one paying, I'm not asking
[19:10.660 --> 19:12.660]  We just run a labor camp
[19:12.660 --> 19:14.660]  We're talking about social media
[19:14.660 --> 19:16.660]  How many social medias does the Grammy Gatsby have?
[19:16.660 --> 19:18.660]  Not medias, how many followers?
[19:18.660 --> 19:20.660]  We're probably like 3,500
[19:20.660 --> 19:22.660]  And we run about 10 different accounts
[19:22.660 --> 19:24.660]  For other people as well
[19:24.660 --> 19:26.660]  That are probably way larger than we are
[19:26.660 --> 19:28.660]  But yeah, you want to look at
[19:28.660 --> 19:30.660]  It's just like having a website or anything else
[19:30.660 --> 19:32.660]  You got to have, content is king as they say
[19:32.660 --> 19:34.660]  And it's quality and consistency
[19:34.660 --> 19:36.660]  You want to have the right branding
[19:36.660 --> 19:38.660]  You want to have your shit together
[19:38.660 --> 19:40.660]  You're not trying to put up pictures of brick walls
[19:40.660 --> 19:42.660]  Or other kinds of stuff like that
[19:42.660 --> 19:44.660]  Or all kinds of weird things
[19:44.660 --> 19:46.660]  You really want to have it together so it actually looks like what the brand needs to be like
[19:46.660 --> 19:48.660]  And expose it
[19:48.660 --> 19:50.660]  I will tell you the one thing I've learned over the years
[19:50.660 --> 19:52.660]  Doing it often
[19:52.660 --> 19:54.660]  Is that your audience needs to be able to watch your story
[19:54.660 --> 19:56.660]  Like how you said, you blew up on Instagram
[19:56.660 --> 19:58.660]  Or how these guys have gone from Santa Cruz to Colorado
[19:58.660 --> 20:00.660]  They want to be a part of that experience
[20:00.660 --> 20:02.660]  I knew of Turpex before they ever had a Colorado presence
[20:02.660 --> 20:04.660]  Because of their cup winnings and Instagram stuff
[20:04.660 --> 20:06.660]  Shout out Turpex
[20:06.660 --> 20:08.660]  Shout out?
[20:08.660 --> 20:10.660]  Who?
[20:10.660 --> 20:12.660]  Turpex
[20:12.660 --> 20:14.660]  Speaking of Turpex, somebody just passed a rig to me
[20:14.660 --> 20:16.660]  And I've got a big chunk of Kim Dog here
[20:16.660 --> 20:18.660]  So I'm going to do this
[20:18.660 --> 20:20.660]  What other topics?
[20:20.660 --> 20:22.660]  Dude I opened, I brought
[20:22.660 --> 20:24.660]  I got all choked up
[20:24.660 --> 20:26.660]  I brought a bottle of Dr. Pepper into the room
[20:26.660 --> 20:28.660]  And Hunt, he's doing it again
[20:28.660 --> 20:30.660]  He's like collapsing with
[20:30.660 --> 20:32.660]  What's going on bro?
[20:32.660 --> 20:34.660]  What's with the Dr. Pepper?
[20:34.660 --> 20:36.660]  This is something I will let some of the other guys in the room talk about first
[20:36.660 --> 20:38.660]  I don't drink alcohol, I don't do a lot of things
[20:38.660 --> 20:40.660]  But there's one thing about 23 Flavors
[20:40.660 --> 20:42.660]  That makes me get a chubby
[20:42.660 --> 20:44.660]  That's what I'm saying bro
[20:44.660 --> 20:46.660]  When I first moved out here and met Hunt
[20:46.660 --> 20:48.660]  This guy, pretty much
[20:48.660 --> 20:50.660]  Almost every time I saw him he had a Dr. Pepper
[20:50.660 --> 20:52.660]  In one of his hands
[20:52.660 --> 20:54.660]  But then he had to start getting all healthy
[20:54.660 --> 20:56.660]  And everything like that
[20:56.660 --> 20:58.660]  Now he's eating kale salads
[20:58.660 --> 21:00.660]  He actually got me on it too, you know what I'm saying
[21:00.660 --> 21:02.660]  And we put the Dr. Peppers away for a while
[21:02.660 --> 21:04.660]  So it's just hard for him to sit here at this table
[21:04.660 --> 21:06.660]  And watch you enjoying this
[21:06.660 --> 21:08.660]  Jelly beans, lip balm
[21:08.660 --> 21:10.660]  Fucking drinks
[21:10.660 --> 21:12.660]  I make all kinds of stuff with the 23 Flavor Terp
[21:12.660 --> 21:14.660]  Lip balm? Who saw that shot?
[21:14.660 --> 21:16.660]  Did anybody see that perfection? Left handed bro
[21:16.660 --> 21:18.660]  Lefty shot right there
[21:18.660 --> 21:20.660]  Yeah okay well thanks
[21:20.660 --> 21:22.660]  I've watched you drool
[21:22.660 --> 21:24.660]  You've looked at my bottle a couple times
[21:24.660 --> 21:26.660]  It's like orange cookies
[21:26.660 --> 21:28.660]  I can just smell it and be happy
[21:28.660 --> 21:30.660]  How long has it been?
[21:30.660 --> 21:32.660]  Probably like a week
[21:32.660 --> 21:34.660]  Oh that's all? You cheated?
[21:34.660 --> 21:36.660]  I'm being honest
[21:36.660 --> 21:38.660]  You know I've cheated bro
[21:38.660 --> 21:40.660]  I've only had like two Dr. Peppers
[21:40.660 --> 21:42.660]  Since we gave them up
[21:42.660 --> 21:44.660]  Even in Vegas? I did not
[21:44.660 --> 21:46.660]  Really? Nope
[21:46.660 --> 21:48.660]  Oh you know they had that fucking luxury Dr. Pepper in Vegas
[21:48.660 --> 21:50.660]  The last one I had was at
[21:50.660 --> 21:52.660]  Shout out Sonic
[21:52.660 --> 21:54.660]  WWE Smackdown
[21:54.660 --> 21:56.660]  Johnny Randall Jr. over here
[21:56.660 --> 21:58.660]  I will tell you though if you go to Sonic and get that cubed crushed ice shit
[21:58.660 --> 22:00.660]  And you get some Dr. Pepper in there
[22:00.660 --> 22:02.660]  Their ice is special isn't it?
[22:02.660 --> 22:04.660]  Yeah one of our partners is hooked on Sonic
[22:04.660 --> 22:06.660]  Oh that's true
[22:06.660 --> 22:08.660]  Hashtag fueled by Sonic
[22:08.660 --> 22:10.660]  Fueled by Sonic, fueled by Ja
[22:10.660 --> 22:12.660]  Fueled by street tacos
[22:12.660 --> 22:14.660]  No but that 23 flavored things is like a nice easy topic to get into
[22:14.660 --> 22:16.660]  Because yeah get your nail all fired up
[22:16.660 --> 22:18.660]  Because we gotta talk about Terps anyways
[22:18.660 --> 22:20.660]  That's the next topic
[22:20.660 --> 22:22.660]  You got to talk about Apothecana and the Gatsby
[22:22.660 --> 22:24.660]  I was gonna give these guys some time
[22:24.660 --> 22:26.660]  I hear just in random conversation that there are
[22:26.660 --> 22:28.660]  Several badass new products
[22:28.660 --> 22:30.660]  Coming out in the future through the TerpX line
[22:30.660 --> 22:32.660]  A couple of them got my attention
[22:32.660 --> 22:34.660]  Of course I ask this while Jordan's taking a mean dab
[22:34.660 --> 22:36.660]  Oh it's all good I'll pass that one
[22:36.660 --> 22:38.660]  Go ahead cough out some answers here
[22:38.660 --> 22:40.660]  Um yeah you know we've been doing some experimenting lately
[22:40.660 --> 22:42.660]  Definitely got some cool new things that we're gonna be bringing out here pretty soon
[22:42.660 --> 22:44.660]  We're gonna have some electronic cigarettes that are gonna be coming out pre-filled
[22:44.660 --> 22:46.660]  And not the standard you know poly you know PG or VG or whatever the fuck people are cutting their oil with
[22:46.660 --> 22:48.660]  Whatever you want to call it
[22:48.660 --> 22:50.660]  You know
[22:50.660 --> 22:52.660]  Do you want to tell us what you're gonna use?
[22:52.660 --> 22:54.660]  Um the
[22:54.660 --> 22:56.660]  The thing is
[22:56.660 --> 22:58.660]  I'm gonna be using
[22:58.660 --> 23:00.660]  I'm gonna be using
[23:00.660 --> 23:02.660]  I'm gonna be using
[23:02.660 --> 23:04.660]  Um
[23:04.660 --> 23:06.660]  There's gonna be a couple different things
[23:06.660 --> 23:08.660]  There's definitely gonna be some
[23:08.660 --> 23:10.660]  Just regular BHO pens
[23:10.660 --> 23:12.660]  That are available
[23:12.660 --> 23:14.660]  And you know it's all gonna be stuff from the garden
[23:14.660 --> 23:16.660]  That we have connected to our processing center
[23:16.660 --> 23:18.660]  So it'll all be stuff that we're you know cultivating
[23:18.660 --> 23:20.660]  Specifically for
[23:20.660 --> 23:22.660]  It's end purpose of you know
[23:22.660 --> 23:24.660]  Being a delicious
[23:24.660 --> 23:26.660]  Electronic cigarette product
[23:26.660 --> 23:28.660]  Being grown for extract instead of just being somebody's rejected material
[23:28.660 --> 23:30.660]  Yeah not only that
[23:30.660 --> 23:32.660]  We've got some edibles that are gonna start coming out here pretty soon
[23:32.660 --> 23:34.660]  Um
[23:34.660 --> 23:36.660]  I'm pretty excited about that
[23:36.660 --> 23:38.660]  We've got a couple people working on them pretty hard
[23:38.660 --> 23:40.660]  There's some things
[23:40.660 --> 23:42.660]  I will even say we cannot say on air about the edibles coming out
[23:42.660 --> 23:44.660]  Because they're shit about to hit the fan one day
[23:44.660 --> 23:46.660]  I can't let him talk about all those
[23:46.660 --> 23:48.660]  Yeah
[23:48.660 --> 23:50.660]  Another big thing is that we're gonna be going rec soon too
[23:50.660 --> 23:52.660]  So
[23:52.660 --> 23:54.660]  Yeah that's one of the biggest things that we've been working on lately
[23:54.660 --> 23:56.660]  So you got
[23:56.660 --> 23:58.660]  Turpex is not available recreationally
[23:58.660 --> 24:00.660]  So as of right now our processing center is in
[24:00.660 --> 24:02.660]  Colorado Springs which obviously as you know
[24:02.660 --> 24:04.660]  Is banned any recreational businesses
[24:04.660 --> 24:06.660]  So
[24:06.660 --> 24:08.660]  We'd love to get you guys down at the spot
[24:08.660 --> 24:10.660]  In Pueblo it'd be a great addition to that
[24:10.660 --> 24:12.660]  For sure well yeah definitely
[24:12.660 --> 24:14.660]  We're hoping by April 1st to be processing
[24:14.660 --> 24:16.660]  Recreationally
[24:16.660 --> 24:18.660]  So we'd love to be running your gear too up there

[24:28.660 --> 24:30.660]  You're just trying to throw out hashtags huh
[24:30.660 --> 24:32.660]  Your goal is to just say as many hashtags on the show as you can
[24:32.660 --> 24:34.660]  I mean I'm the sound by gatherer
[24:34.660 --> 24:36.660]  So what are you guys trying to talk about

[24:50.660 --> 24:52.660]  Absolutely man
[24:52.660 --> 24:54.660]  We were all crushed when he shaved that
[24:54.660 --> 24:56.660]  I can't take you seriously Alec Baldwin
[24:56.660 --> 24:58.660]  I literally have yeah
[24:58.660 --> 25:00.660]  Shweaty balls
[25:00.660 --> 25:02.660]  I definitely have a straight
[25:02.660 --> 25:04.660]  Handlebar curled mustache
[25:04.660 --> 25:06.660]  Up in that one that I grew for months
[25:06.660 --> 25:08.660]  To try to get it ready and the best story about that one
[25:08.660 --> 25:10.660]  I told the boys but when I got my picture
[25:10.660 --> 25:12.660]  Taken at the MED
[25:12.660 --> 25:14.660]  The little lady that works the computer literally looked at me
[25:14.660 --> 25:16.660]  And she was like how long
[25:16.660 --> 25:18.660]  I was like it's been like a couple months she was like
[25:18.660 --> 25:20.660]  Can I touch it
[25:20.660 --> 25:22.660]  She reached over and combed my womb bro
[25:22.660 --> 25:24.660]  Yeah
[25:24.660 --> 25:26.660]  You look like a men's rec softball coach
[25:28.660 --> 25:30.660]  Yeah I was gonna let it fly
[25:30.660 --> 25:32.660]  I just wasn't gonna touch it
[25:32.660 --> 25:34.660]  Those things are better if you just let them pass
[25:34.660 --> 25:36.660]  Alright so we hyped up Turpex a little bit
[25:36.660 --> 25:38.660]  What's uh
[25:38.660 --> 25:40.660]  You mentioned a bunch of products what's your favorite one
[25:40.660 --> 25:42.660]  That you're most excited about that you want to hype up
[25:42.660 --> 25:44.660]  Hmm
[25:44.660 --> 25:46.660]  Does this mean give me a dab
[25:46.660 --> 25:48.660]  Is that what that sign language was
[25:48.660 --> 25:50.660]  I thought Hunt was like giving me sign language
[25:50.660 --> 25:52.660]  I was like I can't say which one of these things he was most excited about
[25:52.660 --> 25:54.660]  That'll throw you off
[25:54.660 --> 25:56.660]  You gotta wipe your fingers off after you do that dude
[25:56.660 --> 25:58.660]  I don't even want to touch you now
[25:58.660 --> 26:00.660]  I would say
[26:00.660 --> 26:02.660]  I don't have a dab over here I'm sorry
[26:02.660 --> 26:04.660]  Don't worry about it I got him
[26:04.660 --> 26:06.660]  We have everybody in the room we're good
[26:06.660 --> 26:08.660]  I would say we're pretty excited about the uh
[26:08.660 --> 26:10.660]  The edibles coming out you know that's something that we've been working on for a while
[26:10.660 --> 26:12.660]  But we just didn't want to you know
[26:12.660 --> 26:14.660]  Possibly some Terp drink
[26:14.660 --> 26:16.660]  Yeah we didn't want to hit the market before
[26:16.660 --> 26:18.660]  You know we really had everything figured out
[26:18.660 --> 26:20.660]  Especially with how restrictive everything is out here
[26:20.660 --> 26:22.660]  Yeah the rules keep changing every week
[26:22.660 --> 26:24.660]  Nobody's trying to shoot ropes like Peter North on that
[26:24.660 --> 26:26.660]  Yeah they hit edibles pretty hard with that Milogram thing
[26:26.660 --> 26:28.660]  I think I win I think I win a dab on that one
[26:28.660 --> 26:30.660]  Definitely silence the whole room
[26:30.660 --> 26:32.660]  Where's the dab
[26:32.660 --> 26:34.660]  Yeah
[26:34.660 --> 26:36.660]  So yeah I mean the edibles are gonna be on point
[26:36.660 --> 26:38.660]  Once we can actually say there's gonna
[26:38.660 --> 26:40.660]  And I will say I'll go a little bit more in depth on some things
[26:40.660 --> 26:42.660]  Troll power is strong
[26:42.660 --> 26:44.660]  Yeah my troll hand is
[26:44.660 --> 26:46.660]  I'm not gonna lie
[26:46.660 --> 26:48.660]  Yeah my troll hand is so fucking big
[26:48.660 --> 26:50.660]  Don't get me on comments cause I'll get going
[26:50.660 --> 26:52.660]  No but we're gonna have some great edibles coming through at the shop
[26:52.660 --> 26:54.660]  And obviously with all the new products they have coming to you
[26:54.660 --> 26:56.660]  I mean you have an unbelievable way to
[26:56.660 --> 26:58.660]  Kind of get a comprehensive medication on
[26:58.660 --> 27:00.660]  You can ingest you can smoke you can you know
[27:00.660 --> 27:02.660]  Have something for the go
[27:02.660 --> 27:04.660]  You can drink
[27:04.660 --> 27:06.660]  And especially with us you know being able to cultivate
[27:06.660 --> 27:08.660]  Strains specifically for extracts
[27:08.660 --> 27:10.660]  You know we're hunting through some new CBD strains here pretty soon
[27:10.660 --> 27:12.660]  For sure
[27:12.660 --> 27:14.660]  We've already got a couple but you know
[27:14.660 --> 27:16.660]  We've got some that are gonna be
[27:16.660 --> 27:18.660]  Truly truly unique terpene profiles on a lot of shit that we're looking for
[27:18.660 --> 27:20.660]  I threw down something I think should be high in CBD if it comes through for you guys
[27:20.660 --> 27:22.660]  Dope
[27:22.660 --> 27:24.660]  Yeah
[27:24.660 --> 27:26.660]  The tour de boracoste
[27:26.660 --> 27:28.660]  Should be high in CBD
[27:28.660 --> 27:30.660]  The uglier plants will be higher in CBD is what I think
[27:30.660 --> 27:32.660]  Yeah that's a great way to describe it
[27:32.660 --> 27:34.660]  You have more of that like bamboo hemp load
[27:34.660 --> 27:36.660]  Yeah those are the CBD plants
[27:36.660 --> 27:38.660]  Not that you boy I mean people that are at home growing hemp rope
[27:38.660 --> 27:40.660]  Calling it cannabis it's okay too
[27:40.660 --> 27:42.660]  Oops
[27:42.660 --> 27:44.660]  Mids
[27:44.660 --> 27:46.660]  Mids mids
[27:46.660 --> 27:48.660]  Alright terpex edibles
[27:48.660 --> 27:50.660]  How long until you think I can have some terpex edibles
[27:50.660 --> 27:52.660]  And is it gonna be like chocolatey stuff
[27:52.660 --> 27:54.660]  Is it gonna be like granola bar stuff
[27:54.660 --> 27:56.660]  Do we tell them about grandma
[27:56.660 --> 27:58.660]  Don't spill any beans I'm just curious
[27:58.660 --> 28:00.660]  I'm just trying to this is a show my job is to ask questions
[28:00.660 --> 28:02.660]  You can't wear your headphones and take a dab
[28:02.660 --> 28:04.660]  What is that about
[28:04.660 --> 28:06.660]  I'd say like
[28:06.660 --> 28:08.660]  You don't have to I was just fucking with you
[28:08.660 --> 28:10.660]  It's like turning down the radio so you can see better
[28:10.660 --> 28:12.660]  We've got a few things that we're making this week
[28:12.660 --> 28:14.660]  We're sending everything to get lab tested
[28:14.660 --> 28:16.660]  For it actually hits the shelf
[28:16.660 --> 28:18.660]  Cause you know we don't want any
[28:18.660 --> 28:20.660]  Issues
[28:20.660 --> 28:22.660]  500 milligrams on accident
[28:22.660 --> 28:24.660]  Watch me do a marino dowd
[28:24.660 --> 28:26.660]  Cause I can handle that but you know
[28:26.660 --> 28:28.660]  Most people cannot
[28:28.660 --> 28:30.660]  If you guys can take the 1200 milligram challenge in a day
[28:30.660 --> 28:32.660]  We'd love to hang out
[28:32.660 --> 28:34.660]  Explain the 1200 milligram challenge to me
[28:34.660 --> 28:36.660]  So kind of like no mount nebraska
[28:36.660 --> 28:38.660]  Can we get a little bit of guitar
[28:38.660 --> 28:40.660]  I'll try to go with it
[28:40.660 --> 28:42.660]  But yeah like
[28:42.660 --> 28:44.660]  I mean the 1200 milligram challenge
[28:44.660 --> 28:46.660]  Is much like no mount nebraska
[28:46.660 --> 28:48.660]  In a sense where the name kind of gives it away
[28:48.660 --> 28:50.660]  But there's a lot more in depth about your passion
[28:50.660 --> 28:52.660]  For the actual event
[28:52.660 --> 28:54.660]  So you know you want to start off
[28:54.660 --> 28:56.660]  Probably with maybe 400 to 800 milligrams
[28:56.660 --> 28:58.660]  And slowly work your way up to 12
[28:58.660 --> 29:00.660]  And then at that point you go outside
[29:00.660 --> 29:02.660]  And put your hands up in the air and scream up to Jaah
[29:02.660 --> 29:04.660]  Thank you and have a great day
[29:04.660 --> 29:06.660]  It's basically like any other
[29:06.660 --> 29:08.660]  Mental or physical challenge
[29:08.660 --> 29:10.660]  It's something that you need to work yourself up to
[29:10.660 --> 29:12.660]  You know you can't just jump in
[29:12.660 --> 29:14.660]  At 1200 milligrams
[29:14.660 --> 29:16.660]  I did a couple days at 2500 milligrams
[29:16.660 --> 29:18.660]  Can I get a sponsor?
[29:18.660 --> 29:20.660]  Can I get a sponsor for this?
[29:20.660 --> 29:22.660]  I need somebody to throw down
[29:22.660 --> 29:24.660]  I need 1200 and then I need
[29:24.660 --> 29:26.660]  800 so now we're at
[29:26.660 --> 29:28.660]  2000 and then I need 600
[29:28.660 --> 29:30.660]  Cause you want to step yourself up
[29:30.660 --> 29:32.660]  I want to do like a 300
[29:32.660 --> 29:34.660]  I think I can do I've done 350
[29:34.660 --> 29:36.660]  I think I can do 350 milligrams
[29:36.660 --> 29:38.660]  I will tell you that the way that I have
[29:38.660 --> 29:40.660]  Found best to imbibe
[29:40.660 --> 29:42.660]  The 1200 milligrams is straight capsules
[29:42.660 --> 29:44.660]  And you open the capsules up and take them
[29:44.660 --> 29:46.660]  While they're half open
[29:46.660 --> 29:48.660]  And then you just pretty much you know
[29:48.660 --> 29:50.660]  You just jump right in like a Latin Scarf
[29:50.660 --> 29:52.660]  The last time we were preparing for the
[29:52.660 --> 29:54.660]  The 1200 milligram challenge
[29:54.660 --> 29:56.660]  I was actually pretty disappointed
[29:56.660 --> 29:58.660]  Because I was you know talking
[29:58.660 --> 30:00.660]  Hell of shit on everybody because I had been
[30:00.660 --> 30:02.660]  Training really hard like I was waking up everyday
[30:02.660 --> 30:04.660]  And just slamming a thousand you know
[30:04.660 --> 30:06.660]  Eating a thousand milligrams for breakfast
[30:06.660 --> 30:08.660]  You know what I'm saying and then having another
[30:08.660 --> 30:10.660]  Couple hundred for lunch you know what I'm saying
[30:10.660 --> 30:12.660]  I was ready by the time
[30:12.660 --> 30:14.660]  That happened everybody else had been eating so many
[30:14.660 --> 30:16.660]  Capsules too training for
[30:16.660 --> 30:18.660]  Training for the challenge that it was just like
[30:18.660 --> 30:20.660]  Shit wasn't going well business wise
[30:20.660 --> 30:22.660]  For anybody yeah you definitely have a very
[30:22.660 --> 30:24.660]  Relaxed state of mind the one homie
[30:24.660 --> 30:26.660]  The one homie in Washington who was going to be doing it
[30:26.660 --> 30:28.660]  With us he broke like two mothership minis
[30:28.660 --> 30:30.660]  In a week or some shit like that
[30:30.660 --> 30:32.660]  I believe the exact story was that he knocked over
[30:32.660 --> 30:34.660]  His mothership mini bubbler
[30:34.660 --> 30:36.660]  While he was trying to go to sleep
[30:36.660 --> 30:38.660]  And also had like a tornado of money
[30:38.660 --> 30:40.660]  Blowing around on his patio
[30:40.660 --> 30:42.660]  Or some shit so yeah
[30:42.660 --> 30:44.660]  I mean that's what I'm saying is it's not like you want to go
[30:44.660 --> 30:46.660]  Straight to the black diamonds at the mountain and throw
[30:46.660 --> 30:48.660]  Yourself down a mountain
[30:48.660 --> 30:50.660]  1200 is no joke at all
[30:50.660 --> 30:52.660]  We wanted to make sure we were over a thousand
[30:52.660 --> 30:54.660]  And if you really want to get intense
[30:54.660 --> 30:56.660]  You try to hit 2500
[30:56.660 --> 30:58.660]  That just silenced the room again
[30:58.660 --> 31:00.660]  So that's like the gram dab
[31:00.660 --> 31:02.660]  Of edibles is what we're doing
[31:02.660 --> 31:04.660]  Yeah pretty much yeah and also it's like if you
[31:04.660 --> 31:06.660]  Don't smoke those are obviously good ways to do it
[31:06.660 --> 31:08.660]  If you're really trying to get you know some sort of
[31:08.660 --> 31:10.660]  Sedation for me it was just the fact that like
[31:10.660 --> 31:12.660]  I don't have anxiety and I'm extremely
[31:12.660 --> 31:14.660]  Focused and let's be real if you're
[31:14.660 --> 31:16.660]  Trying to like never get sick
[31:16.660 --> 31:18.660]  You know what I'm saying exactly as we know
[31:18.660 --> 31:20.660]  Cannabis can cure everything
[31:20.660 --> 31:22.660]  Pretty much so if you eat
[31:22.660 --> 31:24.660]  That shit you're going to be fucking awesome
[31:24.660 --> 31:26.660]  That was the other thought right is that like we figured
[31:26.660 --> 31:28.660]  If we could do like 1200 milligrams for a month
[31:28.660 --> 31:30.660]  There was no way that we would ever have any
[31:30.660 --> 31:32.660]  Pathogens cancers bullshit like there's
[31:32.660 --> 31:34.660]  No way they even get into us because we're just super
[31:34.660 --> 31:36.660]  Saturated in our cannabinoid system and our lymph nodes
[31:36.660 --> 31:38.660]  Yeah so I need a sponsor somebody
[31:38.660 --> 31:40.660]  Throw down like 2500
[31:40.660 --> 31:42.660]  Pills or 2500 milligrams
[31:42.660 --> 31:44.660]  We gotta figure out how that works but I mean at some point
[31:44.660 --> 31:46.660]  We'll take care of you Jeff
[31:46.660 --> 31:48.660]  Between all parties in the room I'm sure we've got
[31:48.660 --> 31:50.660]  We'll get this we got some ways to make
[31:50.660 --> 31:52.660]  Now I will tell you we are not liable
[31:52.660 --> 31:54.660]  For what happens after you hit 1200 milligrams
[31:54.660 --> 31:56.660]  I don't as long as none of them are real high
[31:56.660 --> 31:58.660]  CBD have I told you guys about my
[31:58.660 --> 32:00.660]  CBD adventures have you listened to the episode with CBD
[32:00.660 --> 32:02.660]  No you guys are all extract
[32:02.660 --> 32:04.660]  Artists do what do you guys call yourselves now extract
[32:04.660 --> 32:06.660]  Artists the term anymore is there a
[32:06.660 --> 32:08.660]  Is there a word to use
[32:08.660 --> 32:10.660]  Okay everyone goes silent
[32:10.660 --> 32:12.660]  I remember extract people I don't like that term
[32:12.660 --> 32:14.660]  I don't like that term yeah
[32:14.660 --> 32:16.660]  We're not crazy about that term so you guys
[32:16.660 --> 32:18.660]  Just hash guys right yeah just had your turp
[32:18.660 --> 32:20.660]  X all right so these guys are hash guys
[32:20.660 --> 32:22.660]  You know we started doing this shit because
[32:22.660 --> 32:24.660]  We love it and you guys are gonna
[32:24.660 --> 32:26.660]  Love this this is the appropriate group I've noticed
[32:26.660 --> 32:28.660]  If I smoke too much CBD I can't
[32:28.660 --> 32:30.660]  Bust a nut really yeah
[32:30.660 --> 32:32.660]  You go full drunk
[32:32.660 --> 32:34.660]  Yeah well no no it works it's like
[32:34.660 --> 32:36.660]  It's still yeah it just won't there's
[32:36.660 --> 32:38.660]  No way it's birth control
[32:38.660 --> 32:40.660]  Yeah yeah I have not
[32:40.660 --> 32:42.660]  Been smoking enough CB you know
[32:42.660 --> 32:44.660]  Did you just not too fast enough
[32:44.660 --> 32:46.660]  It's a done he's done
[32:46.660 --> 32:48.660]  I just you know I haven't
[32:48.660 --> 32:50.660]  Smoked enough CBD is to really perform
[32:50.660 --> 32:52.660]  That kind of research on myself I guess
[32:52.660 --> 32:54.660]  I went to a dispensary I had a
[32:54.660 --> 32:56.660]  Chick friend who was actually this guy's gonna go
[32:56.660 --> 32:58.660]  You know smoke a bunch of CBD and beat his dick
[32:58.660 --> 33:00.660]  Yeah it's gonna how it happened
[33:00.660 --> 33:02.660]  We went to the dispensary and bought a bunch of CBD
[33:02.660 --> 33:04.660]  Medicine and we smoked out and we went
[33:04.660 --> 33:06.660]  To the house and tried to fucking shag and there
[33:06.660 --> 33:08.660]  Was no it was fun dude we're both like
[33:08.660 --> 33:10.660]  Yeah but like an hour of just sweating on each
[33:10.660 --> 33:12.660]  Other I looked at her I was like I don't think
[33:12.660 --> 33:14.660]  I don't think just two wooks walking around
[33:14.660 --> 33:16.660]  Just working it out dude yeah
[33:16.660 --> 33:18.660]  So nice little look out for the day
[33:18.660 --> 33:20.660]  How do you think that's known
[33:20.660 --> 33:22.660]  About as good as his story about shitting
[33:22.660 --> 33:24.660]  In his buddy's VW bus
[33:24.660 --> 33:26.660]  That did happen
[33:28.660 --> 33:30.660]  We won't get into that
[33:30.660 --> 33:32.660]  There's another podcast for that one
[33:32.660 --> 33:34.660]  I have never found that with CBD's but I mean I don't know
[33:34.660 --> 33:36.660]  Maybe I think it's the same thing I don't I don't tend to
[33:36.660 --> 33:38.660]  Lean towards the CBD's as much as I'm looking
[33:38.660 --> 33:40.660]  For THCV and THC and
[33:40.660 --> 33:42.660]  I'm gonna try it
[33:42.660 --> 33:44.660]  Yeah right
[33:44.660 --> 33:46.660]  Go jerk off
[33:46.660 --> 33:48.660]  Wait 24 hours smoke a bunch of
[33:48.660 --> 33:50.660]  CBD or go try to whack one out and see if
[33:50.660 --> 33:52.660]  It's just like three quarters of the way there
[33:52.660 --> 33:54.660]  I mean what ratio is this
[33:54.660 --> 33:56.660]  This might be something patentable
[33:56.660 --> 33:58.660]  It was actually the can of tonic
[33:58.660 --> 34:00.660]  It was like 21%
[34:00.660 --> 34:02.660]  CBD or something yeah it was one of those
[34:02.660 --> 34:04.660]  21 to 1
[34:04.660 --> 34:06.660]  Something like that
[34:06.660 --> 34:08.660]  What happens if GW Pharma
[34:08.660 --> 34:10.660]  Is patenting a 21 to 1
[34:10.660 --> 34:12.660]  They are the biggest cannabis care givers in Colorado Springs
[34:12.660 --> 34:14.660]  Yeah
[34:14.660 --> 34:16.660]  G Pharma was like oh what
[34:18.660 --> 34:20.660]  No one will ever come again
[34:20.660 --> 34:22.660]  I wonder what happens if you hit
[34:22.660 --> 34:24.660]  An 80 to 1 ratio I wonder if you just
[34:24.660 --> 34:26.660]  Turn into like titanium superman
[34:26.660 --> 34:28.660]  I was talking to a nurse and she said
[34:28.660 --> 34:30.660]  I think she's a paramedic or something and she said
[34:30.660 --> 34:32.660]  That there is an electrical response
[34:32.660 --> 34:34.660]  In your brain that causes a seizure
[34:34.660 --> 34:36.660]  And that same electrical response in your brain
[34:36.660 --> 34:38.660]  Is responsible for your orgasm
[34:38.660 --> 34:40.660]  It's like an electrical firing
[34:40.660 --> 34:42.660]  When you smoke CBD it turns that off
[34:42.660 --> 34:44.660]  That's why you don't have a seizure
[34:44.660 --> 34:46.660]  They code that receptor probably
[34:46.660 --> 34:48.660]  You're coding your cum receptor too
[34:48.660 --> 34:50.660]  It's the same thing
[34:50.660 --> 34:52.660]  You're literally muting your cum receptor
[34:52.660 --> 34:54.660]  You're just putting a cover over it
[34:54.660 --> 34:56.660]  It's like getting in an elevator with no 13th floor
[34:58.660 --> 35:00.660]  The government is going to get a hold of that
[35:00.660 --> 35:02.660]  And use it for overpopulation
[35:02.660 --> 35:04.660]  Something
[35:04.660 --> 35:06.660]  But that's just something I discovered
[35:06.660 --> 35:08.660]  I will tell you if you do the
[35:08.660 --> 35:10.660]  They grow a lot of hemp in China
[35:10.660 --> 35:12.660]  And they use that shit and it ain't working over there
[35:12.660 --> 35:14.660]  It is not working
[35:14.660 --> 35:16.660]  Give John John a microphone
[35:16.660 --> 35:18.660]  So you're saying CBDs will actually make you last longer
[35:18.660 --> 35:20.660]  Yes much longer
[35:20.660 --> 35:22.660]  I couldn't cum at all
[35:22.660 --> 35:24.660]  I need to smoke more CBD
[35:24.660 --> 35:26.660]  Some people need to be getting on them CBDs then
[35:26.660 --> 35:28.660]  Yeah if you're a minute man then get up on the CBD
[35:28.660 --> 35:30.660]  Get up on the fucking CBDizzles
[35:30.660 --> 35:32.660]  Yup smoke that shit
[35:32.660 --> 35:34.660]  Let's be honest we've all been under the minute before
[35:34.660 --> 35:36.660]  Oh there's been times yeah
[35:36.660 --> 35:38.660]  Sometimes I'm proud
[35:40.660 --> 35:42.660]  First one's always easy
[35:44.660 --> 35:46.660]  It's about getting back up after you fall
[35:46.660 --> 35:48.660]  Every time
[35:48.660 --> 35:50.660]  Just take a Viagra you'll be good
[35:50.660 --> 35:52.660]  I will tell you if you do the 1200mg challenge
[35:52.660 --> 35:54.660]  You'll probably have the same effect
[35:54.660 --> 35:56.660]  I've noticed that for sure
[35:56.660 --> 35:58.660]  I don't know if I'll be able to pay attention long enough to even care
[35:58.660 --> 36:00.660]  Tug tug tug I wanna play Xbox
[36:02.660 --> 36:04.660]  You know you're getting old and you get bored jerking off
[36:04.660 --> 36:06.660]  Yeah fuck man
[36:06.660 --> 36:08.660]  This is stupid
[36:08.660 --> 36:10.660]  Again and again and again
[36:10.660 --> 36:12.660]  The first one was easy
[36:12.660 --> 36:14.660]  Alright
[36:14.660 --> 36:16.660]  Ah shit we've gotten way off course here
[36:16.660 --> 36:18.660]  Always happens
[36:18.660 --> 36:20.660]  420's coming up
[36:20.660 --> 36:22.660]  And I've been told that there is a cannabis cup booth
[36:22.660 --> 36:24.660]  Well there is some things in the work
[36:24.660 --> 36:26.660]  Obviously we talked earlier about all the different brands
[36:26.660 --> 36:28.660]  Lots of brands
[36:28.660 --> 36:30.660]  Smokey Brand one of the big badass
[36:30.660 --> 36:32.660]  Clothing companies that I help work with
[36:32.660 --> 36:34.660]  They've decided to do this road show every year
[36:34.660 --> 36:36.660]  So I'll be manning up and running their production
[36:36.660 --> 36:38.660]  For the Denver Cannabis Cup coming up
[36:38.660 --> 36:40.660]  Seattle, San Fran, LA
[36:40.660 --> 36:42.660]  And then we'll be doing
[36:42.660 --> 36:44.660]  What is it
[36:44.660 --> 36:46.660]  Agenda and Magic
[36:46.660 --> 36:48.660]  AEG, Big Gallery
[36:48.660 --> 36:50.660]  We'll be doing varieties of high end fashion
[36:50.660 --> 36:52.660]  All the way down to cannabis cups
[36:52.660 --> 36:54.660]  To glass shows
[36:54.660 --> 36:56.660]  But this Cannabis Cup in Denver
[36:56.660 --> 36:58.660]  We will have a Smokey Brand booth
[36:58.660 --> 37:00.660]  That will be a really large island
[37:00.660 --> 37:02.660]  And there's probably 4 or 5 brands
[37:02.660 --> 37:04.660]  That I'm not able to say yet
[37:04.660 --> 37:06.660]  It'll be in it
[37:06.660 --> 37:08.660]  There will be appearances from the Turpex Boys
[37:08.660 --> 37:10.660]  And Apothecanna
[37:10.660 --> 37:12.660]  And Iry Genetics and Duditz Damsel
[37:12.660 --> 37:14.660]  Shout out to Damsel
[37:14.660 --> 37:16.660]  But I don't think there's going to be a
[37:16.660 --> 37:18.660]  There's not going to be a big thing
[37:18.660 --> 37:20.660]  You guys will be appearing
[37:20.660 --> 37:22.660]  I'm not sure if we're going to do a booth
[37:22.660 --> 37:24.660]  The MED unfortunately
[37:24.660 --> 37:26.660]  We're waiting for some rules to come out about that
[37:26.660 --> 37:28.660]  For sure
[37:28.660 --> 37:30.660]  We will be in our booth at Smokey Brands
[37:30.660 --> 37:32.660]  That won't be licensed cannabis brands
[37:32.660 --> 37:34.660]  So we'll have all kinds of clothing brands
[37:34.660 --> 37:36.660]  And glass brands
[37:36.660 --> 37:38.660]  But no product, no smokeable, consumable cannabis product
[37:38.660 --> 37:40.660]  They will have their own smokeable, consumable product
[37:40.660 --> 37:42.660]  But you can't as an MED licensed business
[37:42.660 --> 37:44.660]  I don't believe you're going to be able to have anything going on
[37:44.660 --> 37:46.660]  I think High Times just cancelled the medical side of it too
[37:46.660 --> 37:48.660]  I'm not sure
[37:48.660 --> 37:50.660]  It's hearsay
[37:50.660 --> 37:52.660]  There's definitely a bunch of different rumors
[37:52.660 --> 37:54.660]  That's why I'm saying it
[37:54.660 --> 37:56.660]  There's a bunch of brands that I will say once they announce
[37:56.660 --> 37:58.660]  It won't be any of the staple cannabis brands
[37:58.660 --> 38:00.660]  That we have in Colorado
[38:00.660 --> 38:02.660]  It will be more of the fashion, glass, vape pens
[38:02.660 --> 38:04.660]  Different stuff like that
[38:04.660 --> 38:06.660]  That will be at the booth
[38:06.660 --> 38:08.660]  But all of the homies and the GG fam will be there dabbing out
[38:08.660 --> 38:10.660]  And having a great time
[38:10.660 --> 38:12.660]  Most of the people in the room right now
[38:12.660 --> 38:14.660]  Will be getting down
[38:14.660 --> 38:16.660]  Along with some Suicide Girls and some other people like that
[38:16.660 --> 38:18.660]  Hey now Suicide Girls
[38:18.660 --> 38:20.660]  Hashtag Suicide Girls
[38:20.660 --> 38:22.660]  Look who's here
[38:22.660 --> 38:24.660]  People just keep strolling in
[38:24.660 --> 38:26.660]  Shout out to more Turpex crew
[38:26.660 --> 38:28.660]  Shout out, shout out, shout out
[38:28.660 --> 38:30.660]  I'll be at the Cannabis Cup booth
[38:30.660 --> 38:32.660]  I'll be at the cup roaming around
[38:32.660 --> 38:34.660]  I'll be at the booth
[38:34.660 --> 38:36.660]  What's your booth called?
[38:36.660 --> 38:38.660]  It's going to be the Smokey Brand booth
[38:38.660 --> 38:40.660]  They haven't come out with the map
[38:40.660 --> 38:42.660]  They'll be Smokey Socks all over
[38:42.660 --> 38:44.660]  They've got a big Pot Leaf as a logo
[38:44.660 --> 38:46.660]  We'll have a bunch of clothes
[38:46.660 --> 38:48.660]  We'll have all kinds of shit set up
[38:48.660 --> 38:50.660]  Obviously there will be a VIP inside
[38:50.660 --> 38:52.660]  GG fam
[38:52.660 --> 38:54.660]  It's time for party
[38:54.660 --> 38:56.660]  So yeah
[38:56.660 --> 38:58.660]  I probably won't have any seeds
[38:58.660 --> 39:00.660]  Because honestly I'm going to a
[39:00.660 --> 39:02.660]  I don't want to sound like a dick
[39:02.660 --> 39:04.660]  There's a private party Friday night
[39:04.660 --> 39:06.660]  Between a bunch of seed breeders and traders
[39:06.660 --> 39:08.660]  And a bunch of invite only's
[39:08.660 --> 39:10.660]  And my seeds will probably be eaten up then
[39:10.660 --> 39:12.660]  The only seeds he'll be giving away are the ones he's picking up for me on Friday night
[39:12.660 --> 39:14.660]  Yeah
[39:14.660 --> 39:16.660]  Yeah
[39:16.660 --> 39:18.660]  You mean you've got a surplus of iris seeds somewhere?
[39:18.660 --> 39:20.660]  Yeah
[39:20.660 --> 39:22.660]  There might be a couple packs in my backpack when I start
[39:22.660 --> 39:24.660]  Actually there might be a couple in there right now guys
[39:24.660 --> 39:26.660]  Who knows?
[39:26.660 --> 39:28.660]  You never know
[39:28.660 --> 39:30.660]  The Dubwise, the Black Cherry Chem
[39:30.660 --> 39:32.660]  Are we supposed to say the other ones?
[39:32.660 --> 39:34.660]  If I've given you anything you can talk about them
[39:34.660 --> 39:36.660]  The Torobora Grape Snopper?
[39:36.660 --> 39:38.660]  Is that what it is?
[39:38.660 --> 39:40.660]  Torobora X 2 King Chem Grape Snopper OG
[39:40.660 --> 39:42.660]  Whoa
[39:42.660 --> 39:44.660]  That's the one that's the mouthful
[39:44.660 --> 39:46.660]  Yeah
[39:46.660 --> 39:48.660]  Pretty much if you're in a new state
[39:48.660 --> 39:50.660]  You can whatever you're trying to do
[39:50.660 --> 39:52.660]  If you can find a way to get some beans
[39:52.660 --> 39:54.660]  Iris Genetics is probably a company that you should have in your garden
[39:54.660 --> 39:56.660]  I appreciate that
[39:56.660 --> 39:58.660]  I work hard to keep stuff going
[39:58.660 --> 40:00.660]  I'm actually working on the Black Cherry Chem F2 right now
[40:00.660 --> 40:02.660]  I'm actually harvesting
[40:02.660 --> 40:04.660]  I did the pheno hunt to find the female that I want to breed with
[40:04.660 --> 40:06.660]  And I'm harvesting them now
[40:06.660 --> 40:08.660]  I think I chose the right bitch
[40:08.660 --> 40:10.660]  I've got a purple one
[40:10.660 --> 40:12.660]  If you need anybody else to help you verify
[40:12.660 --> 40:14.660]  Make selections
[40:14.660 --> 40:16.660]  We will verify
[40:16.660 --> 40:18.660]  One of the biggest ones that we all talk about is the Lemon Jeffrey
[40:18.660 --> 40:20.660]  Because that's the one hitter
[40:20.660 --> 40:22.660]  Lemon Jeffrey
[40:22.660 --> 40:24.660]  There are arguments
[40:24.660 --> 40:26.660]  I've crossed the Lemon Jeffrey to the Grateful Dog
[40:26.660 --> 40:28.660]  And there are arguments over what the name is going to be
[40:28.660 --> 40:30.660]  I know
[40:30.660 --> 40:32.660]  Anybody want to throw out something?
[40:32.660 --> 40:34.660]  Yeah the room
[40:34.660 --> 40:36.660]  King Joffrey
[40:36.660 --> 40:38.660]  Give John John a mic for a second
[40:38.660 --> 40:40.660]  King Joffrey
[40:40.660 --> 40:42.660]  Hashtag Game of Thrones
[40:42.660 --> 40:44.660]  That's what my buddy said
[40:44.660 --> 40:46.660]  I didn't get the reference there
[40:46.660 --> 40:48.660]  He was a real dickhead king
[40:48.660 --> 40:50.660]  Yeah well that's me
[40:50.660 --> 40:52.660]  I'm a dickhead and I'm a king
[40:52.660 --> 40:54.660]  Hashtag spoilers
[40:54.660 --> 40:56.660]  They ended up poisoning him
[40:56.660 --> 40:58.660]  I slung him out there
[40:58.660 --> 41:00.660]  Do your thing
[41:00.660 --> 41:02.660]  That's cool I like it
[41:02.660 --> 41:04.660]  Controversy on the show
[41:04.660 --> 41:06.660]  There's tons of them
[41:06.660 --> 41:08.660]  I don't know
[41:08.660 --> 41:10.660]  The lemon is so prevalent
[41:10.660 --> 41:12.660]  We gotta taste it
[41:12.660 --> 41:14.660]  I would love a taste
[41:14.660 --> 41:16.660]  It's upside down
[41:16.660 --> 41:18.660]  It's de-leafed
[41:18.660 --> 41:20.660]  It's gonna get that final trim
[41:20.660 --> 41:22.660]  Right now it's looking like that 70's bush
[41:22.660 --> 41:24.660]  God dude
[41:24.660 --> 41:26.660]  Here's the question
[41:26.660 --> 41:28.660]  Is it gonna make some Full Meld or some Nebraska
[41:28.660 --> 41:30.660]  I don't fuck around
[41:30.660 --> 41:32.660]  It's gonna make some Turpex Shatter
[41:32.660 --> 41:34.660]  Or some Live Resin
[41:34.660 --> 41:36.660]  Some Garden of Whedon Live Resin
[41:36.660 --> 41:38.660]  That's all I flux with
[41:38.660 --> 41:40.660]  If I can make my own hash
[41:40.660 --> 41:42.660]  I have my own vac oven
[41:42.660 --> 41:44.660]  I can make some decent hash
[41:44.660 --> 41:46.660]  But Garden of Whedon shout out boys
[41:46.660 --> 41:48.660]  They live 5 minutes away from me
[41:48.660 --> 41:50.660]  That's my homies
[41:50.660 --> 41:52.660]  They make most of my hash for me
[41:52.660 --> 41:54.660]  Since nobody's had a harvest for a minute
[41:54.660 --> 41:56.660]  We're hash heads and we smoked all our hash
[41:56.660 --> 41:58.660]  It's been Turpex
[41:58.660 --> 42:00.660]  Shout out to Garden of Whedon and Irie

[42:04.660 --> 42:06.660]  We need to start getting some credit
[42:06.660 --> 42:08.660]  We need to figure out a hashtag

[42:14.660 --> 42:16.660]  Get them down there
[42:16.660 --> 42:18.660]  I said on another show
[42:18.660 --> 42:20.660]  If you guys are in Denver
[42:20.660 --> 42:22.660]  Or if you're in Pueblo
[42:22.660 --> 42:24.660]  Drive to Springs and go get this hash
[42:24.660 --> 42:26.660]  It's worth the 45 minute drive
[42:26.660 --> 42:28.660]  I do it every week
[42:28.660 --> 42:30.660]  I'm up here once a week
[42:30.660 --> 42:32.660]  I gotta start coming on Fridays
[42:32.660 --> 42:34.660]  It's donut day bro
[42:34.660 --> 42:36.660]  We do Dilla Donuts every Friday morning
[42:36.660 --> 42:38.660]  We play hip hop all day
[42:38.660 --> 42:40.660]  We have Amy's Donuts in the lobby
[42:40.660 --> 42:42.660]  For all the people that come through while they last
[42:42.660 --> 42:44.660]  I should have waited to deliver that new drop
[42:44.660 --> 42:46.660]  I delivered a new drop of flavors over there
[42:46.660 --> 42:48.660]  At close tonight
[42:48.660 --> 42:50.660]  I should have came right when they opened tomorrow
[42:50.660 --> 42:52.660]  So I could have got first pick of the day
[42:52.660 --> 42:54.660]  Big up, shout out
[42:54.660 --> 42:56.660]  Amy's Donuts in the Spring

[42:58.660 --> 43:00.660]  From that Elvis with banana chips on it
[43:00.660 --> 43:02.660]  To the blueberry icing
[43:02.660 --> 43:04.660]  With the rainbow stripe
[43:04.660 --> 43:06.660]  All kinds of shit
[43:06.660 --> 43:08.660]  They got a cookie butter one
[43:08.660 --> 43:10.660]  They got a cookie butter half chocolate
[43:10.660 --> 43:12.660]  They have cotton candies
[43:12.660 --> 43:14.660]  So you're on that healthy tip but you'll eat the donuts
[43:14.660 --> 43:16.660]  Jon Jon is my proof here
[43:16.660 --> 43:18.660]  I've only had one donut this whole month
[43:18.660 --> 43:20.660]  On that healthy shit
[43:20.660 --> 43:22.660]  You're looking good bro
[43:22.660 --> 43:24.660]  I still got bronchitis and inhale you guys make fun of me
[43:24.660 --> 43:26.660]  I usually eat about two of them
[43:26.660 --> 43:28.660]  Hashtag sad face
[43:28.660 --> 43:30.660]  Hashtag fatty
[43:30.660 --> 43:32.660]  Hashtag no shame
[43:32.660 --> 43:34.660]  I will tell you
[43:34.660 --> 43:36.660]  We as a staff we get in there early on Friday morning
[43:36.660 --> 43:38.660]  Cause it's Dilla Donuts
[43:38.660 --> 43:40.660]  You put on some J Dilla and you let Quasimodo and Doom play
[43:40.660 --> 43:42.660]  Throw the music up
[43:42.660 --> 43:44.660]  Wolfing down some fucking sugar at 8 o'clock in the morning
[43:44.660 --> 43:46.660]  Things get productive
[43:46.660 --> 43:48.660]  You guys are doing cartwheels when I get in there
[43:48.660 --> 43:50.660]  Slam a Red Bull get after it
[43:50.660 --> 43:52.660]  Stop in the shop guys check it out it's a cool place
[43:52.660 --> 43:54.660]  I don't shop I go to like three dispensaries on the planet
[43:54.660 --> 43:56.660]  And this is one of them
[43:56.660 --> 43:58.660]  We appreciate all the love
[43:58.660 --> 44:00.660]  We appreciate you guys down there in Pueblo
[44:00.660 --> 44:02.660]  And especially like you know
[44:02.660 --> 44:04.660]  Oh that is the thing bro
[44:04.660 --> 44:06.660]  Come down cause that boy be on that shula
[44:06.660 --> 44:08.660]  They got that shula boy that shula that good
[44:08.660 --> 44:10.660]  We do have some good
[44:10.660 --> 44:12.660]  We're waiting for our massively grown crop to come in
[44:12.660 --> 44:14.660]  And that'll be you know
[44:14.660 --> 44:16.660]  Probably like two months
[44:16.660 --> 44:18.660]  But right now we have great flowers and everything on the shelf
[44:18.660 --> 44:20.660]  We have an unbelievable concentrate selection
[44:20.660 --> 44:22.660]  Sometimes we're up to like 24 different flavors of concentrates
[44:22.660 --> 44:24.660]  Nice
[44:24.660 --> 44:26.660]  Right now I think we're at like 13
[44:26.660 --> 44:28.660]  I shouldn't even say it
[44:28.660 --> 44:30.660]  Chuck Norris is gone bro
[44:30.660 --> 44:32.660]  It was gone in a day
[44:32.660 --> 44:34.660]  Yeah gone as shit
[44:34.660 --> 44:36.660]  We do have the Gary Busey OG on the shelf right now though
[44:36.660 --> 44:38.660]  Duck butter coming soon
[44:38.660 --> 44:40.660]  What's the one that I want to know about this name
[44:40.660 --> 44:42.660]  Drake's Hankershift
[44:42.660 --> 44:44.660]  You should probably put the nature boy Ric Flair on the mic
[44:44.660 --> 44:46.660]  Cause that's his name that he came up with
[44:46.660 --> 44:48.660]  Let's hear about this nature boy
[44:48.660 --> 44:50.660]  He actually knows what's up with the turkeys
[44:50.660 --> 44:52.660]  Get up on the top rope and tell me about this shit
[44:52.660 --> 44:56.180]  Um
[44:56.180 --> 44:58.180]  Dead silence
[44:58.180 --> 45:00.180]  You put him on the spot and fucked him up
[45:00.180 --> 45:02.180]  Is blue dream or white widow
[45:02.180 --> 45:04.180]  It's actually based on the video game Uncharted
[45:04.180 --> 45:06.180]  You see
[45:06.180 --> 45:08.180]  Cause he's
[45:08.180 --> 45:10.180]  Drake is an adventurer
[45:10.180 --> 45:12.180]  And he has a handkerchief
[45:12.180 --> 45:14.180]  The real story
[45:14.180 --> 45:16.180]  This is what happened
[45:16.180 --> 45:18.180]  Got it out of him though
[45:18.180 --> 45:20.180]  This is what happened
[45:20.180 --> 45:22.180]  It was some flow
[45:22.180 --> 45:24.180]  It was some flow and some blue dream
[45:24.180 --> 45:26.180]  Cross
[45:26.180 --> 45:28.180]  And so we thought
[45:28.180 --> 45:30.180]  People are going to cry when they fucking hit this shit
[45:34.180 --> 45:36.180]  And so we just said fuck
[45:36.180 --> 45:38.180]  Who cries a lot
[45:38.180 --> 45:40.180]  And we're like Drake was playing maybe on Pandora or something
[45:40.180 --> 45:42.180]  And just I don't know
[45:42.180 --> 45:44.180]  It was not playing on Pandora
[45:44.180 --> 45:46.180]  I will say that's the only concentrate we will ever see
[45:46.180 --> 45:48.180]  That has the word handkerchief in it
[45:48.180 --> 45:50.180]  And the name Drake I hope
[45:50.180 --> 45:52.180]  You pretty much said what I said
[45:52.180 --> 45:54.180]  I saw the drop
[45:54.180 --> 45:56.180]  I was like wow really now we got to explain what genetics
[45:56.180 --> 45:58.180]  Drake handkerchief is to everybody
[45:58.180 --> 46:00.180]  I like the story
[46:00.180 --> 46:02.180]  And you're right because hashtag fuck blue dream
[46:02.180 --> 46:04.180]  Fuck blue dream
[46:04.180 --> 46:06.180]  And flow
[46:06.180 --> 46:08.180]  And flow
[46:08.180 --> 46:10.180]  I know you guys out there with that fucking DJ shortcut
[46:10.180 --> 46:12.180]  And all kinds of other bullshit
[46:12.180 --> 46:14.180]  Whatever else
[46:14.180 --> 46:16.180]  Let's talk about that for a second
[46:16.180 --> 46:18.180]  Because since moving to fucking Colorado
[46:18.180 --> 46:20.180]  I've seen more flow
[46:20.180 --> 46:22.180]  Shit that smells or tastes exactly like
[46:22.180 --> 46:24.180]  Fucking flow than I've seen ever in my fucking life
[46:24.180 --> 46:26.180]  What is up with that
[46:26.180 --> 46:28.180]  Is that the bomb shit out here
[46:28.180 --> 46:30.180]  They don't like kush
[46:30.180 --> 46:32.180]  They don't like perp
[46:32.180 --> 46:34.180]  Where's the kush
[46:34.180 --> 46:36.180]  The dog's trying to go outside
[46:36.180 --> 46:38.180]  I think a lot of it is the fact that blue dream just blows up like a balloon
[46:38.180 --> 46:40.180]  For people that don't know what they're doing
[46:40.180 --> 46:42.180]  Yeah you could grow the shit out of some blue dream
[46:42.180 --> 46:44.180]  The flow is super easy to grow here
[46:44.180 --> 46:46.180]  It grows outdoors really quickly
[46:46.180 --> 46:48.180]  Any of you dudes trying to get laid with your chick
[46:48.180 --> 46:50.180]  Blue dream the girls love the blue dream
[46:50.180 --> 46:52.180]  Oh my god I fucking love blue dream
[46:52.180 --> 46:54.180]  And if you're a mediocre grower and you need to pull some weight
[46:54.180 --> 46:56.180]  Blue dream is for you
[46:56.180 --> 46:58.180]  Fuck yeah
[46:58.180 --> 47:00.180]  If you've never grown weed before
[47:00.180 --> 47:02.180]  And you're about
[47:02.180 --> 47:04.180]  Whatever
[47:04.180 --> 47:06.180]  I think the flow
[47:06.180 --> 47:08.180]  The flow that goes around here actually came from
[47:08.180 --> 47:10.180]  DJ Short gave that cut to
[47:10.180 --> 47:12.180]  Ed Rosenthal who passed it around to a few people out here
[47:12.180 --> 47:14.180]  And my friend Tom
[47:14.180 --> 47:16.180]  Had a dispensary here and a dispensary in Pueblo
[47:16.180 --> 47:18.180]  And he spread that out through his dispensaries a lot
[47:18.180 --> 47:20.180]  And it also went through other sources
[47:20.180 --> 47:22.180]  I'm not saying he put it all over
[47:22.180 --> 47:24.180]  But that cut I actually think is DJ's flotica
[47:24.180 --> 47:26.180]  And not flow
[47:26.180 --> 47:28.180]  I think back in the 1940's when they eradicated cannabis
[47:28.180 --> 47:30.180]  Back in the day they should have done that to blue dream
[47:30.180 --> 47:32.180]  Definitely
[47:32.180 --> 47:34.180]  Blue dream should never exist
[47:34.180 --> 47:36.180]  So I crossed the blue dream to the grateful dog and I called it the blue healer
[47:36.180 --> 47:38.180]  And it fixed blue dream
[47:38.180 --> 47:40.180]  Did it?
[47:40.180 --> 47:42.180]  It made much larger grateful dog nuggets
[47:42.180 --> 47:44.180]  And it comes out a lot like grateful dog
[47:44.180 --> 47:46.180]  You can't polish a turd
[47:46.180 --> 47:48.180]  You can polish a turd yes
[47:48.180 --> 47:50.180]  But now the part that sucks is I have to keep a mother plant of blue dream in the garden all the time
[47:50.180 --> 47:52.180]  So actually we should get off of blue dream
[47:52.180 --> 47:54.180]  And get on to some other strains that are probably better
[47:54.180 --> 47:56.180]  I know that we all dislike certain stuff
[47:56.180 --> 47:58.180]  What do you got that's coming down the pipeline?
[47:58.180 --> 48:00.180]  I've been working on this F2 of black cherry chem
[48:00.180 --> 48:02.180]  I think
[48:02.180 --> 48:04.180]  You see
[48:04.180 --> 48:06.180]  I'm going to say a name that I've never said on the show
[48:06.180 --> 48:08.180]  But I think if I say it then nobody can steal it from me
[48:08.180 --> 48:10.180]  Because it will be out there
[48:10.180 --> 48:12.180]  I'm going to hit a dead head OG plant
[48:12.180 --> 48:14.180]  With black cherry chem pollen
[48:14.180 --> 48:16.180]  And I want to call it cherry Garcia
[48:16.180 --> 48:18.180]  Because I think that's cool as fuck
[48:18.180 --> 48:20.180]  Copyright cherry Garcia
[48:20.180 --> 48:22.180]  I'll spell it different
[48:22.180 --> 48:24.180]  It'll be cool
[48:24.180 --> 48:26.180]  I would definitely be down to taste those turds
[48:26.180 --> 48:28.180]  Yeah we'll run those
[48:28.180 --> 48:30.180]  I'm trying to find a name for that lemon Jeffrey grateful dog
[48:30.180 --> 48:32.180]  I'm working on
[48:32.180 --> 48:34.180]  I'm looking for an arise male plant right now
[48:34.180 --> 48:36.180]  I want to start using the arise
[48:36.180 --> 48:38.180]  As my breeding staple
[48:38.180 --> 48:40.180]  That'll be my next boy that goes for a long time
[48:40.180 --> 48:42.180]  It'll be like my new stud for the next couple of years
[48:42.180 --> 48:44.180]  What are the turps like on that guy?
[48:44.180 --> 48:46.180]  It's a golden goat crossed a daybreaker
[48:46.180 --> 48:48.180]  So it's sweet kush
[48:48.180 --> 48:50.180]  I like that daybreaker
[48:50.180 --> 48:52.180]  The daybreaker is a great plant
[48:52.180 --> 48:54.180]  Anything you put to the golden goat makes resin
[48:54.180 --> 48:56.180]  Resin comes out of that bitch
[48:56.180 --> 48:58.180]  That male will make everything resiny and stanky
[49:00.180 --> 49:02.180]  I want to talk about something real quick
[49:02.180 --> 49:04.180]  It's the new thing going on all along the social media
[49:04.180 --> 49:06.180]  We're going to talk about this Rosin Text?
[49:06.180 --> 49:08.180]  What are your thoughts?
[49:08.180 --> 49:10.180]  I haven't tried it yet
[49:10.180 --> 49:12.180]  I have not tried it
[49:12.180 --> 49:14.180]  I have an interview
[49:14.180 --> 49:16.180]  We're ahead of ourselves in recording
[49:16.180 --> 49:18.180]  I've recorded an episode that I've left a blank spot
[49:18.180 --> 49:20.180]  To throw in an interview with Soil Grown
[49:20.180 --> 49:22.180]  So I can learn a bit about it
[49:22.180 --> 49:24.180]  Hopefully in the last episode that got tossed in there
[49:24.180 --> 49:26.180]  But the interview is supposed to happen tomorrow
[49:26.180 --> 49:28.180]  When I get home
[49:28.180 --> 49:30.180]  This is awkward
[49:30.180 --> 49:32.180]  We're traveling in time
[49:32.180 --> 49:34.180]  That's what CBD can do also
[49:34.180 --> 49:36.180]  Yes
[49:36.180 --> 49:38.180]  Hold on
[49:38.180 --> 49:40.180]  That shit's been around since the 60s and 70s
[49:40.180 --> 49:42.180]  Like a lot of the other stuff
[49:42.180 --> 49:44.180]  It's not necessarily
[49:44.180 --> 49:46.180]  Sorry I'm out of the loop
[49:46.180 --> 49:48.180]  You want to know what it is?
[49:48.180 --> 49:50.180]  You take your weed
[49:50.180 --> 49:52.180]  You put it in a piece of parchment paper and fold it up
[49:52.180 --> 49:54.180]  Like weed but a nugget
[49:54.180 --> 49:56.180]  You either hair press it
[49:56.180 --> 49:58.180]  Or people are using a t-shirt press
[49:58.180 --> 50:00.180]  In the 60s and 70s that's what would happen back in the day
[50:00.180 --> 50:02.180]  They would take that shitty weed and t-shirt press it
[50:02.180 --> 50:04.180]  And be able to extract something they wouldn't call bubble hash
[50:04.180 --> 50:06.180]  That would sell for more
[50:06.180 --> 50:08.180]  I know that from my time being a cultivator in Tijuana
[50:08.180 --> 50:10.180]  Nice
[50:10.180 --> 50:12.180]  But that's a story for a different day
[50:12.180 --> 50:14.180]  We'll get on that note after the asbestos
[50:14.180 --> 50:16.180]  Completely solventless
[50:16.180 --> 50:18.180]  There's no solvent in there
[50:18.180 --> 50:20.180]  Not even water
[50:20.180 --> 50:22.180]  It's activating and expressing it
[50:22.180 --> 50:24.180]  As it's heating it
[50:24.180 --> 50:26.180]  So you are still losing some potency if it gets hot
[50:26.180 --> 50:28.180]  If I had a hair straightener I'd try it right now
[50:28.180 --> 50:30.180]  Are you activating it though?
[50:30.180 --> 50:32.180]  It is becoming decarbed
[50:32.180 --> 50:34.180]  Is it?
[50:34.180 --> 50:36.180]  Yeah when you're heating it
[50:36.180 --> 50:38.180]  They're using like 100 degrees or something
[50:38.180 --> 50:40.180]  And I think 106 is where decarbing starts
[50:40.180 --> 50:42.180]  I have nothing against it
[50:42.180 --> 50:44.180]  But it doesn't really do much
[50:44.180 --> 50:46.180]  It melts and it gets high and all that stuff
[50:46.180 --> 50:48.180]  But it's not the same terpene profile
[50:48.180 --> 50:50.180]  As a marijuana R&D specialist I think we should try it
[50:50.180 --> 50:52.180]  You should definitely
[50:52.180 --> 50:54.180]  I'd love to see some locals do it
[50:54.180 --> 50:56.180]  So I can take a dab of it and talk about it on the show
[50:56.180 --> 50:58.180]  Well then there you have it obviously now
[50:58.180 --> 51:00.180]  Awesome
[51:00.180 --> 51:02.180]  I'm going to go to the beauty supply store and pick up a hair straightener
[51:02.180 --> 51:04.180]  I'm on it
[51:04.180 --> 51:06.180]  I was at Walgreens today and I saw a whole fucking aisle of them
[51:06.180 --> 51:08.180]  They're going to be gone in the next couple days
[51:08.180 --> 51:10.180]  You took a couple seconds and looked at them
[51:10.180 --> 51:12.180]  I did
[51:12.180 --> 51:14.180]  I really did
[51:14.180 --> 51:16.180]  Remember when Bed Bath & Beyond put the dab torches
[51:16.180 --> 51:18.180]  The little no stick mats
[51:18.180 --> 51:20.180]  And turkey basters all in the same area
[51:20.180 --> 51:22.180]  And Pyrex dishes
[51:22.180 --> 51:24.180]  It was all in one little
[51:24.180 --> 51:26.180]  They're like dab guys here you go
[51:26.180 --> 51:28.180]  It's like a computer program
[51:28.180 --> 51:30.180]  They're going to buy a controller
[51:30.180 --> 51:32.180]  A game and a headset
[51:32.180 --> 51:34.180]  They say it seems like people are buying a lot of torches
[51:34.180 --> 51:36.180]  And turkey basters at the same time
[51:36.180 --> 51:38.180]  We should put them together
[51:38.180 --> 51:40.180]  Damn Jews
[51:40.180 --> 51:42.180]  I think that's important
[51:42.180 --> 51:44.180]  I'm allowed to say that because I'm a Jew
[51:44.180 --> 51:46.180]  Yes you are Jordan you'll be okay
[51:46.180 --> 51:48.180]  I'm interested to see what happens next
[51:48.180 --> 51:50.180]  As opposed to going back into the rising techs
[51:50.180 --> 51:52.180]  And all the other shit and the CO2
[51:52.180 --> 51:54.180]  And all the ice water
[51:54.180 --> 51:56.180]  I got a call from a friend today
[51:56.180 --> 51:58.180]  He's working on some sort of large scale
[51:58.180 --> 52:00.180]  Version of a hair
[52:00.180 --> 52:02.180]  Straight hair t-shirt press situation
[52:02.180 --> 52:04.180]  He's like dude
[52:04.180 --> 52:06.180]  Dude
[52:06.180 --> 52:08.180]  Bro
[52:08.180 --> 52:10.180]  Bro
[52:10.180 --> 52:12.180]  Sure
[52:12.180 --> 52:14.180]  This is it man
[52:14.180 --> 52:16.180]  It's been the big thing lately on the social media
[52:16.180 --> 52:18.180]  It's all people want to talk about
[52:18.180 --> 52:20.180]  His page is blown up
[52:20.180 --> 52:22.180]  He's got mad followers
[52:22.180 --> 52:24.180]  In this episode I just randomly thought about this
[52:24.180 --> 52:26.180]  Took a note in my head
[52:26.180 --> 52:28.180]  Happy birthday to Rob the Dude
[52:28.180 --> 52:30.180]  This episode drops right before your birthday
[52:30.180 --> 52:32.180]  Happy birthday Rob
[52:32.180 --> 52:34.180]  Happy birthday Rob
[52:34.180 --> 52:36.180]  I hope you're listening to this episode
[52:36.180 --> 52:38.180]  I know you don't get a lot of time
[52:38.180 --> 52:40.180]  You're out there at the bowling alley playing a few balls
[52:40.180 --> 52:42.180]  Here at 101.5
[52:42.180 --> 52:44.180]  Happy birthday Rob
[52:44.180 --> 52:46.180]  Let's get back to the show
[52:46.180 --> 52:48.180]  Rob the Dude
[52:48.180 --> 52:50.180]  This has been way too much fun
[52:50.180 --> 52:52.180]  We took some show notes
[52:52.180 --> 52:54.180]  And then someone wrote down the phrase
[52:54.180 --> 52:56.180]  Getting globby
[52:56.180 --> 52:58.180]  Or no slabby
[52:58.180 --> 53:00.180]  Getting slabby
[53:00.180 --> 53:02.180]  We're getting slabby
[53:02.180 --> 53:04.180]  We are getting slabby
[53:04.180 --> 53:06.180]  Let's congregate and get slabby
[53:08.180 --> 53:10.180]  I'm going to pass you the rig
[53:10.180 --> 53:12.180]  So you can get slabby
[53:12.180 --> 53:14.180]  Slabby
[53:14.180 --> 53:16.180]  Obviously it worked
[53:16.180 --> 53:18.180]  I got you
[53:18.180 --> 53:20.180]  Get your slabby hair man
[53:20.180 --> 53:22.180]  I can't actually tell that story
[53:22.180 --> 53:24.180]  You trained him like monkeys
[53:24.180 --> 53:26.180]  The first time I met Mr. Hunt
[53:26.180 --> 53:28.180]  Was at a cannabis cup in Denver
[53:28.180 --> 53:30.180]  And he came up to me
[53:30.180 --> 53:32.180]  And my partner Shane
[53:32.180 --> 53:34.180]  And he's like what are you guys doing
[53:34.180 --> 53:36.180]  I'm like nothing
[53:36.180 --> 53:38.180]  He's like I think we should congregate and get slabby
[53:40.180 --> 53:42.180]  And it stuck
[53:42.180 --> 53:44.180]  People all over the world are going to say
[53:44.180 --> 53:46.180]  Let's congregate and get slabby
[53:46.180 --> 53:48.180]  That's how it works man
[53:48.180 --> 53:50.180]  Drum circle style
[53:50.180 --> 53:52.180]  It actually kind of turned into a joke
[53:52.180 --> 53:54.180]  At the processing facility too
[53:56.180 --> 53:58.180]  Because we run stuff for
[53:58.180 --> 54:00.180]  70 different centers or so
[54:00.180 --> 54:02.180]  And sometimes we get some shit
[54:02.180 --> 54:04.180]  That just yields terribly
[54:04.180 --> 54:06.180]  We're getting slabby
[54:06.180 --> 54:08.180]  The guy whenever we run
[54:08.180 --> 54:10.180]  A thousand gram column
[54:10.180 --> 54:12.180]  And there's virtually nothing in there
[54:12.180 --> 54:14.180]  Fucking homeboy
[54:14.180 --> 54:16.180]  Yell out from the back
[54:16.180 --> 54:18.180]  We're getting slabby
[54:18.180 --> 54:20.180]  And you know
[54:20.180 --> 54:22.180]  It's kind of like when all the hooters chicks
[54:22.180 --> 54:24.180]  Come up and sing happy birthday to you
[54:24.180 --> 54:26.180]  You gotta have the same shit going on
[54:26.180 --> 54:28.180]  A long time ago I went to a guitar center
[54:28.180 --> 54:30.180]  And I bought a piece of equipment called a compressor
[54:30.180 --> 54:32.180]  And I've never been happier that I bought that
[54:32.180 --> 54:34.180]  Because you did not blow out the rest of my equipment
[54:36.180 --> 54:38.180]  I did not know that that was even something
[54:38.180 --> 54:40.180]  That I had to be worried about
[54:40.180 --> 54:42.180]  That's my job to think about
[54:42.180 --> 54:44.180]  This compressor just paid for it's damn self
[54:44.180 --> 54:46.180]  Thank you compressor
[54:46.180 --> 54:48.180]  It just doesn't let all that microphone
[54:48.180 --> 54:50.180]  Get to all of here
[54:50.180 --> 54:52.180]  It's limited
[54:52.180 --> 54:54.180]  When you're getting slabby you do want to get it up
[54:54.180 --> 54:56.180]  You've got to get slabby
[54:56.180 --> 54:58.180]  Slab time
[54:58.180 --> 55:00.180]  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday
[55:00.180 --> 55:02.180]  We're taking slab time
[55:02.180 --> 55:04.180]  Or you can go steady globbing
[55:04.180 --> 55:06.180]  Slab fans
[55:06.180 --> 55:08.180]  Right before the show gets off the rails I'm going to do two commercials
[55:08.180 --> 55:10.180]  Because I actually promise everyone I'll do these ads really quickly
[55:10.180 --> 55:12.180]  We're going to go like this
[55:12.180 --> 55:14.180]  High grow indoor growing supplies
[55:14.180 --> 55:16.180]  Has two locations to serve Colorado
[55:16.180 --> 55:18.180]  Visit the Denver store
[55:18.180 --> 55:20.180]  6271 Beach Street
[55:20.180 --> 55:22.180]  Or check out
[55:22.180 --> 55:24.180]  618 East 4th Street
[55:24.180 --> 55:26.180]  Beautiful Pueblo, Colorado
[55:26.180 --> 55:28.180]  Guys when you're checking out or high grow
[55:28.180 --> 55:30.180]  Tell them you listen to the Grow From Your Heart Podcast
[55:30.180 --> 55:32.180]  Guess what commercial pricing
[55:32.180 --> 55:34.180]  High grow
[55:34.180 --> 55:36.180]  High grow indoor growing supplies
[55:36.180 --> 55:38.180]  There's a shop in Denver
[55:38.180 --> 55:40.180]  There's a shop in Pueblo
[55:40.180 --> 55:42.180]  Shout out to John John for the water bottle delivery
[55:42.180 --> 55:44.180]  Shout out to Johnny
[55:44.180 --> 55:46.180]  Hey where's mine Johnny
[55:46.180 --> 55:48.180]  My new favorite bud tender
[55:48.180 --> 55:50.180]  We got to go to high grow obviously right
[55:50.180 --> 55:52.180]  Go to high grow dude
[55:52.180 --> 55:54.180]  Also we were talking about these guys earlier
[55:54.180 --> 55:56.180]  Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[55:56.180 --> 55:58.180]  The organic portions of this episode were brought to you by my good friends at the Rocky Mountain Worm Company
[55:58.180 --> 56:00.180]  Shout out to Alan and Jay and Sean
[56:00.180 --> 56:02.180]  And everybody over there
[56:02.180 --> 56:04.180]  Visit the Rocky Mountain Worm Company in Colorado Springs
[56:04.180 --> 56:06.180]  For fresh worm castings, African night crawlers, red wigglers
[56:06.180 --> 56:08.180]  Come on let's hear some dirty jokes

[56:16.180 --> 56:18.180]  Make sure you tell those guys
[56:18.180 --> 56:20.180]  You heard about them through the podcast
[56:20.180 --> 56:22.180]  And just to be on point with that
[56:22.180 --> 56:24.180]  On point
[56:24.180 --> 56:26.180]  To Alan and the boys we were talking about y'all before the show too
[56:26.180 --> 56:28.180]  Because I was saying that's some impressive shit that you guys got going over there
[56:28.180 --> 56:30.180]  No pun intended
[56:30.180 --> 56:32.180]  Literally good shit
[56:32.180 --> 56:34.180]  We're JT and the boys
[56:34.180 --> 56:36.180]  JT and the boys
[56:36.180 --> 56:38.180]  I got lost there
[56:38.180 --> 56:40.180]  I'm just gonna nod
[56:40.180 --> 56:42.180]  I gotta dab on the dabber here
[56:42.180 --> 56:44.180]  What else
[56:44.180 --> 56:46.180]  You guys get slabby
[56:46.180 --> 56:48.180]  We went over all your notes
[56:48.180 --> 56:50.180]  I'm ready to let it get a little bit loose here
[56:50.180 --> 56:52.180]  That's why I read the commercials
[56:52.180 --> 56:54.180]  These guys have been sitting over here like little kids behaving themselves
[56:54.180 --> 56:56.180]  We got two, four, five grown men in the room
[56:56.180 --> 56:58.180]  Plus a guy that snuck away because he's too shy for the podcast
[56:58.180 --> 57:00.180]  And a guitar, you can play some guitar dude
[57:00.180 --> 57:02.180]  Yeah let's get the guitar back
[57:02.180 --> 57:04.180]  Maybe it's time for another song
[57:04.180 --> 57:06.180]  How long are you doing
[57:06.180 --> 57:08.180]  Let's talk for another few seconds
[57:08.180 --> 57:10.180]  I'm gonna take a dab with you
[57:10.180 --> 57:12.180]  And then we'll break into song
[57:12.180 --> 57:14.180]  You guys can take a dab together
[57:14.180 --> 57:16.180]  Just like Joey P man
[57:16.180 --> 57:18.180]  I think this is probably time to give a little shout out to Dr. Pepper
[57:18.180 --> 57:20.180]  For all the sponsoring that they do for us
[57:20.180 --> 57:22.180]  No they didn't pay shit dude
[57:22.180 --> 57:24.180]  Fuck that I had to pay for this bottle
[57:24.180 --> 57:26.180]  Don't shout them out at all
[57:26.180 --> 57:28.180]  Don't ever talk about Dr. Pepper
[57:28.180 --> 57:30.180]  Well until they're paying me they'll get a shout out
[57:30.180 --> 57:32.180]  But obviously we need to give a little bit of a talk about
[57:32.180 --> 57:34.180]  Your kindness and wherewithal of everybody
[57:34.180 --> 57:36.180]  Because sometimes out there we're noticing
[57:36.180 --> 57:38.180]  That some of you wooks are slacking
[57:38.180 --> 57:40.180]  Slipping on your pimpin' as they say
[57:40.180 --> 57:42.180]  You gotta keep your pimpin' strong
[57:42.180 --> 57:44.180]  I'm gonna go like this on you
[57:44.180 --> 57:46.180]  No ashy pimpins right
[57:46.180 --> 57:48.180]  If you're gonna bring an ashy pimpin' for the low down low ball price
[57:48.180 --> 57:50.180]  You better make sure that bitch is frosty
[57:50.180 --> 57:52.180]  Whatever the fuck that means
[57:52.180 --> 57:54.180]  We're gonna get into this
[57:54.180 --> 57:56.180]  That's what I say half the time
[57:56.180 --> 57:58.180]  Hunt's saying shit
[57:58.180 --> 58:00.180]  Whatever the fuck that means
[58:00.180 --> 58:02.180]  This is a long episode you guys
[58:02.180 --> 58:04.180]  Just fucking hang in there
[58:04.180 --> 58:06.180]  We're gonna touch on this wook chic stuff that I be seeing around
[58:06.180 --> 58:08.180]  All these dudes with like 35 hat pins
[58:08.180 --> 58:10.180]  Homeboys that don't have no girls
[58:10.180 --> 58:12.180]  But drive a rental car and have slabs
[58:12.180 --> 58:14.180]  You got 7 motherships and a coil rig
[58:14.180 --> 58:16.180]  But you got 82 Honda
[58:16.180 --> 58:18.180]  They get sloppy
[58:18.180 --> 58:20.180]  You still up in mommas basement asking for bacon every morning
[58:20.180 --> 58:22.180]  But you got like 35 fucking rigs in the basement
[58:22.180 --> 58:24.180]  That you kick it on and you get on the forums
[58:24.180 --> 58:26.180]  And get down
[58:26.180 --> 58:28.180]  Fucking mad pendies with fucking opals
[58:28.180 --> 58:30.180]  And I'll get down with you
[58:30.180 --> 58:32.180]  I'm not trying to harsh anybody's mellow
[58:32.180 --> 58:34.180]  On the west coast or the east coast
[58:34.180 --> 58:36.180]  Or any bullshit
[58:36.180 --> 58:38.180]  If you wanna get down on the motherfucking pendie rigs
[58:38.180 --> 58:40.180]  And you wanna wear all that crap it's cool
[58:40.180 --> 58:42.180]  I'm just saying when you become a grown ass man
[58:42.180 --> 58:44.180]  And you wanna get grown ass man pussy
[58:44.180 --> 58:46.180]  You gotta put that shit in a box
[58:46.180 --> 58:48.180]  And move it to the left like Beyonce
[58:48.180 --> 58:50.180]  That's all I'm trying to say
[58:50.180 --> 58:52.180]  Whatever the fuck that means
[58:52.180 --> 58:54.180]  Dab with me bro
[58:54.180 --> 58:56.180]  We're dabbing
[58:56.180 --> 58:58.180]  Shout out Joey P
[58:58.180 --> 59:00.180]  If you haven't heard of him look him up
[59:00.180 --> 59:02.180]  Hashtag man pussy
[59:02.180 --> 59:04.180]  Dope
[59:04.180 --> 59:06.180]  Yep
[59:06.180 --> 59:08.180]  Definitely these guys are getting down
[59:08.180 --> 59:10.180]  They're doing like the whole wedding cross your arms together
[59:10.180 --> 59:12.180]  And take each other's fucking dab
[59:12.180 --> 59:14.180]  It's cute
[59:14.180 --> 59:16.180]  Yeah they're getting sloppy
[59:16.180 --> 59:18.180]  I think that's illegal at springs
[59:18.180 --> 59:20.180]  Don't be jealous
[59:20.180 --> 59:22.180]  Peanut butter and jealous over there
[59:22.180 --> 59:24.180]  I'm getting all the peanut jelly
[59:24.180 --> 59:26.180]  Straight up cooks
[59:26.180 --> 59:28.180]  All up in your turp baby
[59:28.180 --> 59:30.180]  That's how it goes though
[59:30.180 --> 59:32.180]  This has been one of my favorite episodes to record
[59:32.180 --> 59:34.180]  And I hate to say that to all my homies back at home
[59:34.180 --> 59:36.180]  That record with me but you guys brought something
[59:36.180 --> 59:38.180]  To the table that hasn't been brought to the table
[59:38.180 --> 59:40.180]  For a while
[59:40.180 --> 59:42.180]  There's definitely a weird thing in this house
[59:42.180 --> 59:44.180]  I'm actually sitting next to my business partner
[59:44.180 --> 59:46.180]  And my father as well as my friend
[59:46.180 --> 59:48.180]  Yeah
[59:48.180 --> 59:50.180]  Shit just got weird
[59:50.180 --> 59:52.180]  I'm confused
[59:52.180 --> 59:54.180]  I'm looking around the room and there's nobody here old enough to be your father
[59:54.180 --> 59:56.180]  So unless there's an urn in the room
[59:56.180 --> 59:58.180]  That doesn't make any sense
[59:58.180 --> 01:00:00.180]  I'm talking about Jordan he's my father
[01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.180]  I've been nicknamed dad
[01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:04.180]  You know by pretty much everybody
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.180]  Are you the turpex king basically
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:08.180]  No I wouldn't say the king
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.180]  But I would say
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:12.180]  The fatherly figure
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:14.180]  The godfather
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:16.180]  No
[01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:18.180]  That's little Anthony Junior Junior from Brooklyn
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:20.180]  That comes in every now and then
[01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:22.180]  You know the guy who you call
[01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:24.180]  When your battery's dead
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.180]  And you need your car jumped
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.180]  And fountain
[01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:30.180]  That's not me
[01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.180]  I'm the good son
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.180]  I would imagine
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:36.180]  No but you're the good son
[01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:38.180]  I've also had to
[01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.180]  You know sit there
[01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.180]  And have discussions
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.180]  About birth control
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.180]  Yeah
[01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:48.180]  That got shouted out from the other fucking room by the way
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.180]  He's like the Brian Epstein of turpex
[01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.180]  Hashtag Beatles reference
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.180]  Yes yes
[01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:56.180]  I'm not sure
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:58.180]  He was the manager of the Beatles
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.180]  And once he died they all fell apart and blamed it on Yoko
[01:01:00.180 --> 01:01:02.180]  Does the dude in the other room want to be on the show at all
[01:01:02.180 --> 01:01:04.180]  Do you have any desire
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.180]  I doubt it
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:08.180]  He's getting down on some turps over there
[01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:10.180]  But I would say
[01:01:10.180 --> 01:01:12.180]  I was trying to put together a star studded cast
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:14.180]  So we could get a repeat performance
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:16.180]  Oh you guys will be back bro
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:18.180]  My shoes was too heavy I couldn't get it out of the car by myself
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:20.180]  Anytime you need production
[01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.180]  Or you need me to line up some talent bro
[01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.180]  Just give me a call it's what we do
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.180]  What kind of talent you got bro
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:28.180]  Whatever you can bring to the table
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:30.180]  Let's get them all here
[01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:32.180]  They don't call him the gatherer for nothing
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:34.180]  We need to get Addy back on the show
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.180]  He was on episode number 2
[01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:38.180]  He sucked at podcasting
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:40.180]  Shout out to the guy that doesn't want to come in the room
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:42.180]  He's still getting some love
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:44.180]  He told me one time
[01:01:44.180 --> 01:01:46.180]  He was like nope
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:48.180]  He's about 17 dabs in relaxing after being under lights all day
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.180]  Shout out he deserves the time
[01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:52.180]  Bro we're going to get serious for half a second
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:54.180]  We were talking today at the shop
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:56.180]  About being under high intensity discharge lights
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.180]  Oh yeah for sure
[01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.180]  Hunt taught me something I never thought about
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:02.180]  Cover your skin up in the grow rooms
[01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:04.180]  If you're in your own personal grow you're probably alright
[01:02:04.180 --> 01:02:06.180]  But if you're in a room with 20 or 30 or 40
[01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.180]  Or like I work with there's 120 lights in some of the places
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.180]  Cover your skin up
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:12.180]  Cover the top of your head
[01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.180]  Wear some glasses
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.180]  People are getting melanoma
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:18.180]  People are seeing weird shit on their heads
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.180]  They're getting like signs of sunburn
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.180]  Their hair is falling out and shit
[01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.180]  You're going to go blind in there get some good glasses
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:26.180]  I didn't even think of that
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.180]  I only think about the glasses
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:30.180]  Cover up your skin cover your hands
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.180]  What about sunscreen?
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.180]  I don't know if it's
[01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.180]  Maybe
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.180]  That's a really good question
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.180]  I'm not a dermatologist or a sunscreen producer
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:42.180]  Or a scientist
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.180]  You guys aren't scientists
[01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:46.180]  I just play one on the internet
[01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.180]  It's definitely something that's been talked about
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.180]  Obviously it's the exposure rate that you're in
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:52.180]  If you're in a grow room for 6 to 8 hours a day
[01:02:52.180 --> 01:02:54.180]  It's definitely great
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:56.180]  It's great to cover
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:58.180]  I have tattoos so that's why I choose
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.180]  That's why I choose to use
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.180]  I use long sleeves and hats
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:04.180]  And glasses and all that stuff because then my ink doesn't fade
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:06.180]  And I don't have to worry about all the other stuff
[01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.180]  But I have heard from some of my homies
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.180]  The Cali and Asbel
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180]  They get down
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.180]  Solid
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:16.180]  If you're tatted up
[01:03:16.180 --> 01:03:18.180]  Sexy tattoo models
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:20.180]  Damn he is tatted up
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:22.180]  He's tatted up
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:24.180]  Shirt up
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:26.180]  His pubes are tatted up
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:28.180]  Where his pubes should be there's a tattoo
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:30.180]  It's a tattoo of pubes
[01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:32.180]  But you can see the difference
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:34.180]  In your arm tattoos and your body tattoos
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:36.180]  From having your shirt and where you're exposed
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:38.180]  He's tatted guys
[01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.180]  I know what you have to go through at the MED
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:42.180]  To be an owner of a dispensary
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:44.180]  And I can only imagine
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:46.180]  There was a whole page
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:48.180]  Of your tattoos
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:50.180]  I've seen other stories of like
[01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.180]  They did each leg tattooed
[01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:54.180]  Do you think you should formalize this
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.180]  Or you know
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:03:58.180]  Just writing it on a piece of paper man it's good enough
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:00.180]  I was like I'm not really trying to
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.180]  They ask for all of your tattoos
[01:04:02.180 --> 01:04:04.180]  And what they are and all that kind of stuff
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.180]  I just wanted to sit down and figure it all out
[01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.180]  So I just went by body part and I just told them all the body parts that were tattooed
[01:04:08.180 --> 01:04:10.180]  Which is pretty much every one
[01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.180]  Other than you know a couple
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.180]  Ass cheeks
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.180]  I got a hundred dollar bill in my dick because I like to play with my money
[01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:18.180]  Guys if you want to find out if that's true
[01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:20.180]  Come to the Cannabis Grand Crew in Aspen
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:22.180]  This November

[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.180]  Oh actually I can say that
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:28.180]  The next Cannabis Grand Crew is May 30th
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:30.180]  In Seattle Washington

[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.180]  It's Washington I can't travel that far
[01:04:36.180 --> 01:04:38.180]  It's going to be a great panel
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.180]  Unless the Grammy Gatsby is paying for that shit
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.180]  If I'm flying
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.180]  Damn
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.180]  I already got to do the 2500mg
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:48.180]  I'd rather go to the crew so you fly me out there and give me a hotel room
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:50.180]  And we'll go
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.180]  I need to get sponsored on that 2500mg too
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.180]  See I'll donate my 25 over there
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:56.180]  And then I'll just go out there to Seattle
[01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:58.180]  I'm getting worked over on the show
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:00.180]  I don't even know what's happening
[01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:02.180]  Thanks for inviting me

[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:08.180]  All day long
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.180]  I hear a guitar just went brink
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.180]  And we were promised a song after a dab
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.180]  Is the bread song going to come out today?
[01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.180]  Is this the first global release of the bread song?
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:18.180]  We've been going for an hour
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.180]  It doesn't count
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:22.180]  People heard it
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:24.180]  There's some 12 year olds on call of duty
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.180]  That got the brunt of that one
[01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:28.180]  Really
[01:05:28.180 --> 01:05:30.180]  We haven't practiced it in a while
[01:05:30.180 --> 01:05:32.180]  We can try to lay something down
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.180]  I probably got muted 5 seconds into it
[01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.180]  That's why I quit using it
[01:05:36.180 --> 01:05:38.180]  I don't even play anymore
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.180]  It's just everyone trolling everyone
[01:05:40.180 --> 01:05:42.180]  We weren't even playing I was just singing
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:44.180]  Actually you know what else
[01:05:44.180 --> 01:05:46.180]  Before you get into the song
[01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:48.180]  You guys did a nice little pretty facelift over at Turblex
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:50.180]  With the logo and the website coming
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:52.180]  Yes we did
[01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:54.180]  That actually just got to me today
[01:05:54.180 --> 01:05:56.180]  Changed it on Instagram
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.180]  So check that out
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.180]  I think it's definitely a lot better
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.180]  I guess the website is going to have all the places
[01:06:02.180 --> 01:06:04.180]  Where we sell Turblex right?
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.180]  I was going to ask if there was a bunch of places you guys knew of
[01:06:06.180 --> 01:06:08.180]  Where folks can get it but it's only medical
[01:06:08.180 --> 01:06:10.180]  So I didn't want to tease all the out of staters
[01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.180]  I'll still tease all the out of staters
[01:06:12.180 --> 01:06:14.180]  Since homeboy is sitting here might as well just say green and healthy wellness
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:16.180]  Go there
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.180]  I was there for
[01:06:18.180 --> 01:06:20.180]  They're in the room
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:22.180]  I hung out for what 30 minutes
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.180]  I hung out for somewhere between an hour
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:26.180]  Half the customers that showed up were recreational people
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.180]  Hoping to shop and you had to turn them away
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:30.180]  And that sucks
[01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.180]  We hope Colorado Springs
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:34.180]  If you are in Colorado Springs
[01:06:34.180 --> 01:06:36.180]  We would really appreciate it if you have the chance
[01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:38.180]  Tell the people that you can about the shop
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:40.180]  Also if you feel like it
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:42.180]  And you're in support of the cannabis movement
[01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:44.180]  Tell your local representative what's going on
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:46.180]  Because we don't have any rec cannabis other than Denver
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:48.180]  And some other places like that
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:50.180]  Or just get your card for now
[01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:52.180]  Or just if you need rec go drive down to Pueblo
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.180]  And see Mr. Jeff
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.180]  Go down to the spot
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.180]  Come on down
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.180]  Sports fans
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.180]  Getting slabby
[01:07:02.180 --> 01:07:04.180]  Getting slabby
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:06.180]  Getting slabby
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.180]  I thought I'd get a chorus of monkeys
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.180]  I was just taking a dip
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.180]  Getting slabby
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.180]  It happens
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.180]  I just want to apologize
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:18.180]  That's why you opened up the paper was to drop the getting slabby
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.180]  I didn't want to say getting globby again on accident
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:22.180]  I will tell you if you're in the right situation
[01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:24.180]  In an event and you yell out getting slabby
[01:07:24.180 --> 01:07:26.180]  You will find out where the Terpie Crew is
[01:07:26.180 --> 01:07:28.180]  Yes you will
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.180]  It happens to me often
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:32.180]  You'll be at the cup and some random kid from fucking
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:34.180]  No-Mount Nebraska is going to yell getting slabby
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.180]  That's one of my homies in distress
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:38.180]  And you guys will go run
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.180]  And just be some Nebraska kid with 45 hat pins
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:42.180]  In a mothership rig walking around
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.180]  Saying dick
[01:07:44.180 --> 01:07:46.180]  Knock off mothership
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:48.180]  What's with the mothership hype anyway
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:50.180]  I don't know but I just sold mine
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.180]  For almost 3 times
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.180]  What I paid for it back in 2012
[01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:56.180]  So I was pretty happy about that
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:58.180]  The hype is the fact that they're hard to get
[01:07:58.180 --> 01:08:00.180]  And a lot of the people that are seen as
[01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:02.180]  The top OG triple OG OG
[01:08:02.180 --> 01:08:04.180]  To be heady bro you gotta have a mothership
[01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.180]  Dude
[01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.180]  Alright
[01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:10.180]  This rig hits pretty well
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:12.180]  And it didn't cost my car
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:14.180]  I've hit that thing numerous times and I like it
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.180]  You had to use your inhaler sweetheart
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:18.180]  Bring it back over here
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:20.180]  Bring that fucker back over here
[01:08:20.180 --> 01:08:22.180]  I just sold my mothership
[01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.180]  For 10 months rent
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.180]  Damn son
[01:08:26.180 --> 01:08:28.180]  Yeah that was like a pair of Jordans
[01:08:28.180 --> 01:08:30.180]  You know that little rig was
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:32.180]  Cause I bought this one of them 11 breads
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:34.180]  From the blower
[01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:36.180]  Instead of getting it from some random distributor
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:38.180]  Mad Rob
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.180]  Shout out Mad Rob again
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:42.180]  Shout out 719
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.180]  719 coming at ya
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:46.180]  Garden of the gods
[01:08:46.180 --> 01:08:48.180]  This is not my shatter it was passed to me
[01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:50.180]  And I was told here hit this so there's that
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:52.180]  And there's the carb cap that'll make it all work
[01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:54.180]  Shout out to Tazk highly educated titanium
[01:08:54.180 --> 01:08:56.180]  Tazk rock
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:58.180]  Highly educated titanium
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:00.180]  Number one in the biz
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:02.180]  You know it's good
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:04.180]  Sorry about all the verbal diarrhea over here
[01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:06.180]  That's not my hash but I'd love to see you
[01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.180]  Glob that
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.180]  I'm not taking you to the yard tonight I already told you man
[01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:12.180]  We have to get you an oxygen tank
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:14.180]  Along with that fucking inhaler
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.180]  Be Mr. Burns and all the way down the hallway with that shit
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.180]  Does anybody know CPR in this room?
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:22.180]  I got my inhaler
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:24.180]  I was certified like 4 years ago
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:26.180]  It's probably hadn't changed that much
[01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:28.180]  No just stomp on that middle part of his chest until he breathes again
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:30.180]  It's gonna be grandpa Gatsby man
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.180]  Isn't CPR be like I need that bad moon rising
[01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:34.180]  Isn't that CPR
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:36.180]  No different band
[01:09:36.180 --> 01:09:38.180]  Oh that's CCR
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:40.180]  That was good though it was a nice try
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.180]  I believe you actually grabbed the microphone for that
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:44.180]  Cause I had it I was ready
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.180]  Yeah we do
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:48.180]  I do need to say this though I love
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.180]  Kicking it with Jeff cause he goes to comedy shows
[01:09:50.180 --> 01:09:52.180]  He has an awesome sense of humor but the homeboys timing
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.180]  Is impeccable with most of his shit when he's dropping it
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:56.180]  Well thank you
[01:09:56.180 --> 01:09:58.180]  Take out your retainer bit I wish we were recording for the
[01:09:58.180 --> 01:10:00.180]  Yeah that was great
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.180]  He was about to take a little hit of his
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.180]  Albuterol cause he was choking he was wheezing
[01:10:04.180 --> 01:10:06.180]  Asked him if he had to pull out his inhaler to hit it
[01:10:06.180 --> 01:10:08.180]  Everybody's trying to suck
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:10.180]  I'm high
[01:10:10.180 --> 01:10:12.180]  That was a psych out like basketball right there
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.180]  It's good when I'm on it but when I'm not
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:16.180]  It's sloppy
[01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:18.180]  I gave you a compliment about timing
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:20.180]  And then you fucked everything up
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:22.180]  Getting globby
[01:10:22.180 --> 01:10:24.180]  That rescues it all right there
[01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.180]  Don't forget when you're out there by yourself
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:28.180]  And you don't know what to do
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.180]  Temps down terps up
[01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.180]  Get slobby
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.180]  Let that nail cool down a little bit
[01:10:34.180 --> 01:10:36.180]  Drop that dab on the nail
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.180]  Drop your nuts on there
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:40.180]  And then put them in apothecanna
[01:10:40.180 --> 01:10:42.180]  And that's how you know the nail is just right
[01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:44.180]  Shut up apothecanna
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.180]  And then you put the dab on there and you get a little puke taste
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:48.180]  And a little terp ex
[01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:50.180]  It's delish
[01:10:50.180 --> 01:10:52.180]  It's like no melt mixed with terp ex
[01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:54.180]  No ball Nevada
[01:10:54.180 --> 01:10:56.180]  No ball Nevada
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.180]  Hashtag sack terps
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:00.180]  Sack terps
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.180]  Purple kush
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.180]  Purple kush
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:06.180]  There's the first one
[01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:08.180]  It's verbal diarrhea
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.180]  I'm telling you it's a symptom
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:12.180]  Time to cue the guitar
[01:11:12.180 --> 01:11:14.180]  I think we've had enough dabs that it's probably bread sung
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:16.180]  Yeah I've smoked more in this hour
[01:11:16.180 --> 01:11:18.180]  Sitting here talking to you guys
[01:11:18.180 --> 01:11:20.180]  Than I have in one sitting in a long time
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.180]  That's how the Grow From Your Heart podcast happens
[01:11:22.180 --> 01:11:24.180]  We dab it out
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.180]  What a trooper
[01:11:26.180 --> 01:11:28.180]  Somebody has got to hoist the microphone in front of the guitar
[01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.180]  So that we can get some audio
[01:11:30.180 --> 01:11:32.180]  You remember this one pops
[01:11:32.180 --> 01:11:34.180]  If you've got a quarter inch cable I could jack you straight in
[01:11:38.180 --> 01:11:40.180]  It's getting the odd bisexual in here
[01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:42.180]  Jacking him straight in
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:44.180]  We'll just mic you up
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.180]  I turn up the gain and mic you up a little
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.180]  Johnny
[01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.180]  Johnny
[01:11:50.180 --> 01:11:52.180]  Oh you didn't do it
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:54.180]  Hashtag super puns
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.180]  This has been a terptastic episode
[01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:58.180]  So before we
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:00.180]  Before we get out of control with the music
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.180]  I'm really going to thank you guys before we get all ridiculous
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:04.180]  Dude fucking thanks this was awesome
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:06.180]  This is one of my better episodes we're going to get a lot of listens
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:08.180]  This is a great show it's been fun
[01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:10.180]  I had a blast
[01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.180]  It's hard to get this fun vibe on a show when we get everyone too high
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:14.180]  And with this many people it's super exciting
[01:12:14.180 --> 01:12:16.180]  I mean being high or whatever I just had a fucking dope time kicking it
