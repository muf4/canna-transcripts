[00:01.720 --> 00:04.720]  Hey what's up podcast world, it's Rasta Jeff.
[00:04.720 --> 00:06.880]  I'm back with another chunk of old episodes.
[00:06.880 --> 00:12.440]  This time we're doing episodes 28, 29, 30, and 31 of what used to be the I Grow Culture
[00:12.440 --> 00:16.020]  podcast now known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:16.020 --> 00:19.900]  Before we get into these old episodes, let me make the disclaimers I like to make.
[00:19.900 --> 00:23.240]  I've learned a lot in 200 episodes.
[00:23.240 --> 00:26.080]  I think it's been about three years, which means I've learned a lot about growing.
[00:26.080 --> 00:27.520]  I've learned a lot about podcasting.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.280]  I've learned a lot about life.
[00:29.280 --> 00:33.680]  If I say something in these episodes that I have contradicted myself with, just keep
[00:33.680 --> 00:34.860]  in mind that shit changes.
[00:34.860 --> 00:38.260]  This is an ever-changing industry, an ever-changing project.
[00:38.260 --> 00:39.480]  This will always be changing.
[00:39.480 --> 00:41.360]  That's why I do a podcast and do not write a book.
[00:41.360 --> 00:43.960]  So I may say some things that have been updated.
[00:43.960 --> 00:46.380]  I may contradict myself over time.
[00:46.380 --> 00:47.380]  Shit changes.
[00:47.380 --> 00:49.000]  Don't hold it against me.
[00:49.000 --> 00:51.400]  Also all the social media has changed.
[00:51.400 --> 00:54.360]  Since the show has changed from the I Grow Culture podcast to the Grow From Your Heart
[00:54.360 --> 00:57.520]  podcast, I changed all the social media.
[00:57.520 --> 00:59.960]  The Twitter is now at GFYH podcast.
[00:59.960 --> 01:02.600]  The Facebook is the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:02.600 --> 01:06.160]  And email is now growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:06.160 --> 01:08.480]  So if you'd like to reach out, those are your options.
[01:08.480 --> 01:09.520]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:09.520 --> 01:15.360]  The easiest way to get in touch with me, of course, is by sending me an email to growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:15.360 --> 01:19.700]  All right, I think that's all I've got for the start of these episodes.
[01:19.700 --> 01:24.760]  So without making this file too long, let's get into episodes 28, 29, 30, and 31 of what
[01:24.760 --> 01:28.920]  used to be known as the I Grow Culture podcast, now known as the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:28.920 --> 01:31.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for listening.
[01:31.360 --> 02:15.190]  Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:15.190 --> 02:19.390]  Welcome to episode number 28 of the I Grow Culture podcast.
[02:19.390 --> 02:21.990]  They call me Rasta Jeff, and I'll be your captain for this adventure.
[02:21.990 --> 02:25.910]  In this episode, Spencer and Jesse came back and they brought our friend Michael, and we
[02:25.910 --> 02:29.110]  have a talk about pheno hunting, but we got really dabbed out.
[02:29.110 --> 02:32.070]  So I apologize if we were too high to be useful.
[02:32.070 --> 02:33.530]  Hopefully we sparked some questions.
[02:33.530 --> 02:37.250]  So please send those questions to me via email, Twitter, or Facebook, and I'll answer
[02:37.250 --> 02:38.570]  them on an upcoming show.

[04:47.250 --> 04:48.410]  Let's get to the good part.
[04:48.410 --> 04:50.610]  Here goes the pheno hunt talk with the boys.
[04:50.610 --> 04:51.610]  Thanks for listening, guys.
[04:51.610 --> 04:54.050]  All right, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[04:54.050 --> 04:55.050]  We are back.
[04:55.050 --> 04:56.050]  We are gathered today.
[04:56.050 --> 04:57.050]  It sounds like we're in court.
[04:57.050 --> 04:58.050]  I thought church.
[04:58.050 --> 04:59.050]  Man, church or something.
[04:59.050 --> 05:00.050]  We're gathered.
[05:00.050 --> 05:01.050]  Well, it is going to be a sermon.
[05:01.050 --> 05:03.170]  I've got Jesse back.
[05:03.170 --> 05:04.450]  I've got Spence back on the mic.
[05:04.450 --> 05:05.450]  We got a new guy.
[05:05.450 --> 05:06.850]  We got Michael on the microphone with us tonight.
[05:06.850 --> 05:07.850]  What's up, bro?
[05:07.850 --> 05:08.850]  Not much.
[05:08.850 --> 05:09.850]  How you doing?
[05:09.850 --> 05:12.330]  Do you have a Twitter name or something people can look for and find you on or an Instagram
[05:12.330 --> 05:14.530]  so they can check you out while they're listening to the show?
[05:14.530 --> 05:17.690]  It's at Colorado Bearded Dappers on Instagram.
[05:17.690 --> 05:20.090]  Colorado Bearded Dappers in the house.
[05:20.090 --> 05:21.090]  CBD.
[05:21.090 --> 05:22.090]  CBD crew, what up?
[05:22.090 --> 05:23.090]  What up?
[05:23.090 --> 05:26.330]  Yeah, big shout out to the whole CBD crew.
[05:26.330 --> 05:29.290]  So we're going to talk about phenotypes.
[05:29.290 --> 05:32.810]  Everybody here is a pretty experienced grower, so everyone will have a lot of input.
[05:32.810 --> 05:35.370]  I should explain what a phenotype is.
[05:35.370 --> 05:37.130]  The first thing, I'll take one step back.
[05:37.130 --> 05:40.130]  We will explain a genotype.
[05:40.130 --> 05:46.050]  The offspring of two parents will make genetics, and that genetic makeup is the genotype.
[05:46.050 --> 05:49.730]  Out of that genotype, there will be various phenotypes.
[05:49.730 --> 05:54.330]  The best way I can think of to compare it would be when your parents make kids, they
[05:54.330 --> 05:56.050]  don't all look the same.
[05:56.050 --> 05:57.050]  Your dad's probably tall.
[05:57.050 --> 05:58.930]  Your mom's probably a little shorter.
[05:58.930 --> 05:59.930]  One of them's got blonde hair.
[05:59.930 --> 06:01.770]  One of them's got dark hair.
[06:01.770 --> 06:04.930]  When they make kids, sometimes they come out with kids with blonde hair.
[06:04.930 --> 06:06.530]  Sometimes they come out with kids with dark hair.
[06:06.530 --> 06:07.710]  Sometimes they come out blue-eyed.
[06:07.710 --> 06:08.710]  Sometimes they come out brown-eyed.
[06:08.710 --> 06:13.490]  Plants are going to do the same thing, and that's to be expected.
[06:13.490 --> 06:18.530]  There are ways to minimize those traits or bring out traits that you're looking for,
[06:18.530 --> 06:22.330]  but for the most part, when you're making seeds in the beginning, the seeds that most
[06:22.330 --> 06:26.090]  of you guys are able to get your hands on, what a lot of the breeders are selling you,
[06:26.090 --> 06:29.810]  are going to be F1s, F2s, or F3s.
[06:29.810 --> 06:32.570]  There are very few breeders going further than F4.
[06:32.570 --> 06:37.890]  There's one guy I know that brags about F5, which is really cool, really respectable.
[06:37.890 --> 06:39.730]  You're going to see a lot of variation.
[06:39.730 --> 06:40.730]  I just talked a lot.
[06:40.730 --> 06:41.730]  I feel like there's a lot of echo.
[06:41.970 --> 06:46.370]  I feel like I talked a lot about variation in phenotypes and a lot of F1 and stuff.
[06:46.370 --> 06:52.090]  In F1, when you take two plants, a male and a female plant, those are now your P1s.
[06:52.090 --> 06:55.410]  When you breed them, the seeds that come out of that are F1.
[06:55.410 --> 06:56.410]  That's the F1 generation.
[06:56.410 --> 06:58.970]  You're going to have a lot of variety there.
[06:58.970 --> 07:00.270]  Some stuff's going to look like mom.
[07:00.270 --> 07:02.850]  Some stuff's going to look like the dad.
[07:02.850 --> 07:05.610]  You're going to get a lot of switch, and then you're going to get stuff way in the middle
[07:05.610 --> 07:06.650]  between the mom and the dad.
[07:06.650 --> 07:10.530]  You'll get that perfect hybrid, and that's a lot of times the one that everybody's looking
[07:10.530 --> 07:11.530]  for.
[07:11.530 --> 07:13.650]  Then a little further, you'll make an F2.
[07:13.650 --> 07:18.090]  If you find a sweet male and a sweet female out of those F1s and you breed those together,
[07:18.090 --> 07:19.090]  you're going to make an F2.
[07:19.090 --> 07:26.090]  F2 is where you come up with something that we call transgressive segregation, which means,
[07:26.090 --> 07:34.490]  and Jesse smiled when I mentioned this pre-show, transgressive segregation is when your actual
[07:34.490 --> 07:38.450]  progeny, which is your offspring, outperforms the parents.
[07:38.490 --> 07:42.530]  If you take two seeds, a male and a female, and you cross them, and that plant that comes
[07:42.530 --> 07:47.810]  out is way more badass than the parents, you have just experienced transgressive segregation.
[07:47.810 --> 07:52.410]  The F2 level is where you really want to buy the seeds if a breeder is selling those seeds.
[07:52.410 --> 07:56.810]  A lot of us don't really let you know what we're giving you, which F level, how far it
[07:56.810 --> 07:57.810]  is.
[07:57.810 --> 07:58.810]  That's personal stuff.
[07:58.810 --> 08:01.090]  It's breeding secrets, but those F2s are awesome.
[08:01.090 --> 08:05.690]  If you can get ahold of those, that's where a lot of cool shit happens.
[08:05.690 --> 08:08.130]  We're going to back up a little bit.
[08:08.130 --> 08:12.410]  The variation, a lot of us at the table seem to love the variation.
[08:12.410 --> 08:13.770]  We do what is called a pheno hunt.
[08:13.770 --> 08:15.770]  We buy a pack of seeds.
[08:15.770 --> 08:16.770]  You grow that whole pack.
[08:16.770 --> 08:18.570]  It's usually 10 seeds.
[08:18.570 --> 08:21.730]  You look for, if you're not going to breed, you eliminate the females.
[08:21.730 --> 08:22.730]  Hopefully, you've got-
[08:22.730 --> 08:23.730]  The males.
[08:23.730 --> 08:24.730]  The males.
[08:24.730 --> 08:25.730]  Thank you.
[08:25.730 --> 08:26.730]  Thanks.
[08:26.730 --> 08:27.730]  I'm dabbed out, by the way.
[08:27.730 --> 08:28.730]  Not always.
[08:28.730 --> 08:29.730]  Doing good.
[08:29.730 --> 08:30.730]  Yeah, but thanks for watching my back.
[08:30.730 --> 08:32.730]  You got to pull those males, and then you keep it going.
[08:32.730 --> 08:33.730]  I'm sorry.
[08:33.730 --> 08:35.490]  I'm trying to catch my breath also.
[08:35.490 --> 08:36.810]  You got the seed pack.
[08:36.810 --> 08:38.490]  You keep the females going.
[08:38.490 --> 08:39.730]  You try to find the good ones.
[08:39.730 --> 08:42.330]  You look for the traits that those are putting off.
[08:42.330 --> 08:44.930]  Early on, you could tell structure, speed of growth-
[08:44.930 --> 08:45.930]  Bigger.
[08:45.930 --> 08:46.930]  Bigger leaf size.
[08:46.930 --> 08:47.930]  Yeah.
[08:47.930 --> 08:51.770]  You could tell if you got a more indica or sativa leaning phenotype.
[08:51.770 --> 08:52.770]  Node spacing.
[08:52.770 --> 08:53.770]  Node spacing.
[08:53.770 --> 08:54.770]  There you go.
[08:54.770 --> 08:58.370]  A lot of people like to jerk the stem a little bit and smell that, and they think that that's
[08:58.370 --> 09:01.730]  going to lead to a lot of what it's going to really smell like in the end.
[09:01.730 --> 09:02.730]  Yeah.
[09:02.730 --> 09:03.730]  Sometimes.
[09:03.730 --> 09:04.730]  What do you look for?
[09:04.730 --> 09:05.730]  I like smell.
[09:05.730 --> 09:06.730]  Okay.
[09:06.730 --> 09:07.730]  What do you look for in this?
[09:07.730 --> 09:08.730]  This is really important.
[09:08.730 --> 09:14.490]  Node spacing, growth pattern, early resin production.
[09:14.490 --> 09:15.490]  Early resin production.
[09:15.490 --> 09:19.290]  So you want to see that resin about day 30, 25-ish, get the frosty.
[09:19.290 --> 09:21.290]  If things are going real well, for sure.
[09:21.290 --> 09:22.290]  Okay.
[09:22.290 --> 09:23.290]  How about yourself over there, new guy?
[09:23.290 --> 09:24.290]  You want it louder or quieter?
[09:24.290 --> 09:25.290]  Hold on.
[09:25.290 --> 09:26.290]  Oh, it's just this thing over here.
[09:26.290 --> 09:27.290]  We've talked about this headphone thing.
[09:27.290 --> 09:28.290]  I'm usually looking for usually a shorter, stockier plant.
[09:28.290 --> 09:29.290]  Shorter, stocky plants.
[09:29.290 --> 09:30.290]  Yeah, but not necessarily.
[09:30.290 --> 09:31.290]  I usually look for a shorter, stocky plant.
[09:31.290 --> 09:32.290]  I'm looking for a shorter, stocky plant.
[09:32.290 --> 09:33.290]  I'm looking for a shorter, stocky plant.
[09:33.290 --> 09:34.290]  I'm looking for a shorter, stocky plant.
[09:34.290 --> 09:35.290]  I'm looking for a shorter, stocky plant.
[09:35.830 --> 09:36.830]  it, but not necessarily.
[09:36.830 --> 09:38.230]  I usually like more indica plants.
[09:38.230 --> 09:39.850]  That's why I'm usually looking for a shorter, stockier plant.
[09:39.850 --> 09:40.850]  Okay.
[09:40.850 --> 09:42.110]  That makes good sense.
[09:42.110 --> 09:46.590]  Yeah, I also don't like when they wave around too much because usually when they start stacking,
[09:46.590 --> 09:48.230]  they're going to need to be staked up.
[09:48.230 --> 09:49.230]  Eventually.
[09:49.230 --> 09:50.230]  Okay.
[09:50.230 --> 09:51.230]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[09:51.230 --> 09:52.230]  It kind of supports itself a little.
[09:52.230 --> 09:53.230]  All right.
[09:53.230 --> 09:54.230]  How about you, Spence?
[09:54.230 --> 09:59.310]  Well, when I grow seeds, you can usually figure out whether or not your plant's going to be...
[09:59.310 --> 10:00.310]  Well, depending.
[10:00.310 --> 10:02.990]  Sometimes, I grow plants under a scrolling net.
[10:02.990 --> 10:08.050]  So the lankier plants you'll get will be better for a sarognin, in my opinion. And then your
[10:08.050 --> 10:13.250]  shorter stockier plants will be your just freestanding plants that you can stake down
[10:13.250 --> 10:21.670]  and don't have to give too much support besides that. But vigor, smells, and then I look for,
[10:21.670 --> 10:24.930]  especially if I know what it's coming from, you can look at your leaf sets and see if
[10:24.930 --> 10:27.810]  they start matching parents and stuff like that.
[10:27.810 --> 10:31.270]  And you can know which parent you've kind of got. All right. You said something sort
[10:31.270 --> 10:35.230]  of interesting that leads me to another point. Doing the pheno hunt, running a pack of seeds
[10:35.230 --> 10:39.030]  and looking for that pheno that you like. Both of these guys grow different. Everybody
[10:39.030 --> 10:44.310]  in this room grows a different style. Spence does the Scrognett. I don't do any Scroggin.
[10:44.310 --> 10:48.430]  I like to run a seven gallon pot. So those plants you guys are worried about waving around,
[10:48.430 --> 10:52.350]  I've got a tomato cage on those early on in life. So they're not going to get any wave
[10:52.350 --> 10:53.350]  around.
[10:53.350 --> 10:54.350]  I appreciate you doing that.
[10:54.350 --> 10:57.790]  I want that stretchy phenotype. Not stretchy, but I mean, with some height to it. I like,
[10:57.790 --> 11:03.830]  Hey, look, that's what I just got to talk into my damn mic. Sounds a lot better that
[11:03.830 --> 11:07.030]  way. I always tell everyone, get up on the mic. I'm the one over here, nowhere near the
[11:07.030 --> 11:12.990]  microphone. Get punk with it. No, you don't want my teeth on that thing. I'm not that
[11:12.990 --> 11:18.830]  punk. Some days you are. I saw you after your wedding. Hey, burn. Thanks for taking good
[11:18.830 --> 11:22.710]  care of me at the hydro shop the other day. Big shout out to hydro Pueblo. Burn was working
[11:22.710 --> 11:27.670]  and she treated me well. It was awesome. Store looks great. Everything's nice and clean.
[11:28.550 --> 11:30.030]  There's one big empty spot now where I was shopping.
[11:30.030 --> 11:31.030]  Yes, there is.
[11:31.030 --> 11:32.030]  It'll be refilled.
[11:32.030 --> 11:33.030]  Oh, it already is.
[11:33.030 --> 11:38.990]  Nice. All right. We're talking about phenotypes and variation. Some people get angry about
[11:38.990 --> 11:44.470]  variation. Oh, Smith said to talk about S1s. We skipped S1. S1 is when, I do a lot of S1s.
[11:44.470 --> 11:50.590]  That's a feminized seed essentially, or usually. Like if I take my Grateful Dog, two Grateful
[11:50.590 --> 11:56.790]  Dog clones of the same plant, reverse one, throw that pollen on the other one in flower,
[11:56.790 --> 12:01.710]  those seeds are not a new breed. It's just an S1. I've selfed it and made seeds of that
[12:01.710 --> 12:07.070]  same thing. So that's an S1. I find that those, a lot of people hate on feminized seeds, but
[12:07.070 --> 12:10.990]  if an S1 is done properly, and I want to hear your guys' opinions because you've been growing
[12:10.990 --> 12:15.670]  my seeds a little bit, do the S1s seem to mirror their parents a little bit more than
[12:15.670 --> 12:16.670]  the regular-
[12:16.670 --> 12:17.670]  Very much so.
[12:17.670 --> 12:18.670]  Definitely.
[12:18.670 --> 12:25.910]  I definitely think S1s, I had, I think it was, I can't remember what it was, but it
[12:26.030 --> 12:30.670]  came out so different, but so much like it's one of its original parents.
[12:30.670 --> 12:31.670]  Was it the Capleton?
[12:31.670 --> 12:33.070]  I think it might've been the Capleton.
[12:33.070 --> 12:36.110]  It's because I gave you a bunch of Capleton seeds. I'm going to tell everybody that Spence
[12:36.110 --> 12:39.870]  is actually who threw down that White Widow female that I use in the Capleton cross. So
[12:39.870 --> 12:43.030]  shout out, bro. That's awesome. Thank you. You've contributed. So I gave him the first
[12:43.030 --> 12:47.790]  handful of seeds I made out of that to run for me, just to say thanks. But yeah, I saw
[12:47.790 --> 12:51.190]  that in the pictures. I could see the Grateful Dog, but then if you knew that it was that
[12:51.190 --> 12:52.910]  White Widow mom, you could see her in there.
[12:52.910 --> 12:54.150]  Yeah. You could definitely see it.
[12:54.150 --> 12:59.710]  I've got buddies running it now and I can look at them from four or five weeks after
[12:59.710 --> 13:05.070]  they've been planted and you can see in the structure and then in the leaf sets what parent
[13:05.070 --> 13:06.070]  it's related to.
[13:06.070 --> 13:07.070]  Yeah.
[13:07.070 --> 13:08.430]  Or not related to, but closest to.
[13:08.430 --> 13:11.550]  Leaning toward. You can almost tell them, keep that one, pull that one. I'm getting
[13:11.550 --> 13:15.030]  good with, with the shit I've bred. I'm getting really good with that. Shout out to Vigor
[13:15.030 --> 13:20.190]  Lover. Vigor Lover is growing shit out of some Capleton like a boss. He makes dank water
[13:20.190 --> 13:24.070]  hash and grows that strain like a pro. So good work, bro. Thanks for doing my, my seeds
[13:24.070 --> 13:25.070]  justice.
[13:25.070 --> 13:33.870]  What is your experience with S2s? Is it compared to say F2, if you don't mind answering?
[13:33.870 --> 13:38.990]  So the S1s come out, I would say 50% of them look like mommy and then the other 50 are
[13:38.990 --> 13:42.630]  a little weird. I don't know. That's odd to say for a breeder, but they, they, you get
[13:42.630 --> 13:45.590]  mutants and shit when you do that. You're putting.
[13:45.590 --> 13:46.590]  It's not a natural.
[13:46.590 --> 13:50.590]  It's cousin fucking essentially. Like it's not the, it's not really, I know I'm not supposed
[13:50.590 --> 13:53.950]  to say that word on the podcast anymore, but there's no better way to put that. It's that's
[13:53.950 --> 13:59.350]  cousin fucking. Um, as two's come out even more, uh, uniform, I'm going to say maybe
[13:59.350 --> 14:04.230]  70% more uniform. I'm not the mathematician and I didn't keep good enough notes, I guess,
[14:04.230 --> 14:09.110]  but they're even more uniform. Uh, if once you get into that and I didn't realize I was
[14:09.110 --> 14:13.150]  doing something unique when I was doing it, I took the same grateful dog, uh, the original
[14:13.150 --> 14:18.870]  female and Kate kept, uh, taking the clone and using that reversed female to make seeds
[14:18.870 --> 14:23.230]  again and then making another generation almost inbreeding it. And I've gotten it so far that
[14:23.230 --> 14:26.350]  those come out like clones, those grateful dog seeds.
[14:26.350 --> 14:27.350]  Oh, okay.
[14:27.350 --> 14:31.030]  The S4 generation I think is kind of what it would be. I'm, I don't know a lot of people
[14:31.030 --> 14:34.310]  that have done it, so I don't know how to label it. You could test for, those have come
[14:34.310 --> 14:38.230]  out. They're like clones of each other growing seeds from clone, which is kind of nice for
[14:38.230 --> 14:42.750]  a breeder to achieve in a feminine seed. Yeah, for sure. Those aren't out in the market yet
[14:42.750 --> 14:45.670]  guys. That's not what you're getting yet. I haven't made enough of them to check, but
[14:45.670 --> 14:47.670]  yeah, you guys will get them eventually.
[14:47.670 --> 14:50.310]  I bet those would be very popular.
[14:50.310 --> 14:54.710]  Yeah, that's going to be very cool. Uh, I don't know anybody that's gotten them that
[14:54.710 --> 14:56.270]  far. You always find weird shit.
[14:56.270 --> 14:57.270]  Yeah.
[14:57.270 --> 14:58.270]  Nice seeds.
[14:58.270 --> 15:02.630]  That's why I asked. Cause I don't think I've ever grown an S2 that I know of. So, um, you
[15:02.630 --> 15:08.630]  know, I've grown up to like F3 or F4. Um, so, but you know, that's, yeah.
[15:08.630 --> 15:10.630]  How far have you made if you don't mind me asking?
[15:10.630 --> 15:11.630]  Uh, BX3.
[15:11.630 --> 15:12.630]  BX3.
[15:12.630 --> 15:13.630]  Okay.
[15:13.630 --> 15:19.750]  Yeah. So I'm at the point, I don't know if I want to, uh, back cross it one more time.
[15:19.750 --> 15:26.550]  Um, cause I'm pretty happy with what, what I got from it. Um, or if I want to start in
[15:26.550 --> 15:31.870]  crossing it and start making, I guess it'd be a F1, F2 generation.
[15:31.870 --> 15:32.870]  Do you know how?
[15:32.870 --> 15:33.870]  And so on.
[15:33.870 --> 15:38.630]  What percentage of those seeds now are coming out to be what you have in mind?
[15:38.630 --> 15:43.030]  Um, well there's, there's two different phenotypes and I really like them both.
[15:43.030 --> 15:45.830]  As long as you got two and you can identify them.
[15:45.830 --> 15:50.470]  There were some less desirable phenotypes and I worked them out, I believe on the BX2
[15:50.470 --> 15:56.590]  generation when I, when I made the threes. So, um, and the threes of just, uh, the one
[15:56.590 --> 16:00.790]  phenotype I call one night stand and it's, it's a hazy, um, phenotype.
[16:00.790 --> 16:06.470]  I'm shaking my head going, why didn't I write that down one day? I'm like, damn, yo, he
[16:06.470 --> 16:07.470]  just killed you.
[16:07.470 --> 16:13.870]  And then the other one is, uh, just the depot dog and it's real, you know, it was a Kim
[16:13.870 --> 16:20.350]  dog stabilization project. So it's a lot like a Kim D a little bit like diesel, a little
[16:20.350 --> 16:25.670]  bit more, uh, more, more unique thing, uh, or not unique, but different things that's
[16:25.670 --> 16:28.670]  slightly different than Kim D but a lot like it. So
[16:28.670 --> 16:31.910]  Guys, we're throwing around a lot of crazy terms here. Uh,
[16:31.910 --> 16:35.350]  Yeah, my bad for our bad for kind of fucking y'all up, right?
[16:35.350 --> 16:38.830]  No, no, no, no. They'll catch up. Uh, we inspire them to learn stuff. If you're lost,
[16:38.830 --> 16:42.350]  uh, Google it if you want to, or just keep listening and eventually we'll fill you in.
[16:42.350 --> 16:46.150]  I may not be this episode, but all this stuff that we're saying will sound like you'll sound
[16:46.150 --> 16:48.550]  like us in just a few months if you keep listening.
[16:48.550 --> 16:53.990]  Yeah. And to other people and reading books and experience.
[16:53.990 --> 16:54.990]  What's your favorite girl book?
[16:54.990 --> 16:55.990]  Uh, uh, the Mel Frank.
[16:55.990 --> 16:56.990]  Okay. Perfect. Yeah. That's the start. That's the roots of everything.
[16:56.990 --> 16:57.990]  Yeah. That's the first one I ever had.
[16:57.990 --> 16:58.990]  You have a reliable book you go to Michael?
[16:58.990 --> 17:05.990]  My favorite one. I don't really go to it as much anymore, but it was true living organics.
[17:05.990 --> 17:08.990]  Great book. Yeah. Great one.
[17:08.990 --> 17:14.990]  TLO is my pickup book. If I need to go search something, if I'm not hitting the internet,
[17:14.990 --> 17:18.990]  I'm going to go. That book's pretty reliable.
[17:18.990 --> 17:22.990]  Shout out to the Rev. Uh, if you guys need help building soil. Uh, yeah, it's a great
[17:22.990 --> 17:26.990]  book. Uh, we talk about Jesse and I talk a lot about soil building on our outdoor lessons.
[17:26.990 --> 17:31.990]  Uh, if you, if we go too fast, if you want more specifics, that book will fill you in.
[17:31.990 --> 17:36.990]  We'll teach you a lot for myself. I like the Ed Rosenthal, Oakster damn course guide, uh,
[17:36.990 --> 17:42.990]  because it's thorough. It's got bug explanations. It's got all kinds. If I have a problem, that's
[17:42.990 --> 17:45.990]  the first book I go to. If one of you guys is like, Hey bro, and I don't know the answer
[17:45.990 --> 17:48.990]  to it, I go get that one and read it and act like I know.
[17:48.990 --> 17:52.990]  Is that available to the public that is available to the public? I've never read that one.
[17:53.990 --> 17:56.990]  Between that one and Jorge's book, you can cover just about everything.
[17:56.990 --> 17:57.990]  Yeah, Jorge's book's great too.
[17:57.990 --> 18:01.990]  I hate to say it's outdated, but it feels, it's like your dad wrote it. You know, it's
[18:01.990 --> 18:02.990]  like that generation.
[18:02.990 --> 18:03.990]  Yeah, for sure.
[18:03.990 --> 18:04.990]  It's a great book.
[18:04.990 --> 18:08.990]  So is the Mel, uh, man, I don't feel like Mel Franks is the dude's right.
[18:08.990 --> 18:12.990]  It's a Robert Connell Clark is who I think you're thinking of. Uh, Marijuana Botany?
[18:12.990 --> 18:17.990]  No, no, no, not that far back. No, no. This one was written, uh, early eighties, but,
[18:17.990 --> 18:22.990]  uh, the title is, uh, how to grow or in the first chapter, it's a, how to grow a million
[18:22.990 --> 18:27.990]  pounds of skunk weed or something like that. Yeah. Uh, but they're talking about pounds,
[18:27.990 --> 18:35.990]  uh, uh, UK pounds. So, yeah. Yeah. Mel Thomas. I keep wanting to say, I don't know.
[18:35.990 --> 18:38.990]  My Googler is out of reach right now, so we'll just keep the conversation rolling.
[18:38.990 --> 18:45.990]  For sure. My favorite at this point in my life is Google. So, um, you got to sort through
[18:45.990 --> 18:49.990]  a lot of bullshit, but you, but you learn where the reliable sources are. And when you
[18:49.990 --> 18:54.990]  see one of their, um, articles pop up, you know, and most of the time I think they're
[18:54.990 --> 18:59.990]  probably referencing all these great books. So hopefully. And guys, if you read some stuff
[18:59.990 --> 19:03.990]  on Google, read three or four articles on Google, think about what you're going to do.
[19:03.990 --> 19:07.990]  Go smoke a fat joint and call one of your grower friends or Twitter somebody here on
[19:07.990 --> 19:12.990]  the show and say, Hey, I just got this high idea and I want to try this crazy shit to
[19:12.990 --> 19:16.990]  my plants. Yeah. And one of us on the show, usually we're pretty friendly folk. Uh, if
[19:16.990 --> 19:20.990]  you catch us at the right time, we'll answer your emails. It takes me a minute. Y'all.
[19:20.990 --> 19:25.990]  I get a lot of messages. Uh, I grow culture at hotmail.com. I grow culture on Twitter.
[19:25.990 --> 19:30.990]  I grow culture on Instagram. And of course on Facebook, feel free to message me. Uh,
[19:30.990 --> 19:34.990]  you can go to the I read genetics, Colorado website and go to the forum, create an account,
[19:34.990 --> 19:38.990]  log in there. And I make it a point to answer those questions there personally, because
[19:38.990 --> 19:43.990]  that is my forum. I feel responsible. So log in there, create an account. I'll answer
[19:43.990 --> 19:48.990]  all of your questions. And if not my buddy Tony or cut proof or good drill or somebody
[19:48.990 --> 19:53.990]  in there will help you out really soon. That's a good way to learn a lot of shit. Be leery
[19:53.990 --> 19:59.990]  of information from a lot of forums, especially I'm not gonna say any names, but there's two
[19:59.990 --> 20:03.990]  specific ones that are banned from two forums for talking shit about people saying the wrong
[20:04.990 --> 20:08.990]  shit on there. And I'm okay with that. You can, yeah, if you're going to do stuff wrong
[20:08.990 --> 20:12.990]  and I say that's bullshit and you ban me, uh, you're supporting bullshit. So ban me.
[20:12.990 --> 20:17.990]  I don't want to play anyway. Yeah. Yeah. We don't need to shout out any of those websites.
[20:17.990 --> 20:22.990]  I read genetics, Colorado.com. There's one. I really want to say its name, but I'm not
[20:22.990 --> 20:29.990]  going to. Does it look like this motion that I make? Yes. I am banned the fuck from that
[20:29.990 --> 20:36.990]  website. It looks like twisting a joint. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, so phenotypes I should mention,
[20:36.990 --> 20:41.990]  I'm going to turn the music down just a touch. I feel like I'm yelling. Uh, the phenotypes
[20:41.990 --> 20:45.990]  just to make you guys a little familiar, girl scout cookies is a phenotype. There are two
[20:45.990 --> 20:49.990]  known phenotypes of girl scout cookies. Everybody in the room is shaking their head. We all
[20:49.990 --> 20:55.990]  know that forum cut that everybody has. And then there's the platinum cut. Um, that I
[20:56.990 --> 21:00.990]  guess not everybody has that they brag about having in Cali. Is there more? Yeah, I think
[21:00.990 --> 21:05.990]  there may be more because of the, yeah. And that's why I meant, Oh, the thin mint cut.
[21:05.990 --> 21:12.990]  That's right. And what the OG KB OG, is that a hybrid or is that, I think it's, no, it's
[21:12.990 --> 21:17.990]  not, it's not a cross. It's just a, just a phenotype. Okay. Yeah. It's the funky, crazy
[21:17.990 --> 21:21.990]  looking one. If you've ever seen pictures of somebody saying girl scout, OG actually
[21:21.990 --> 21:26.990]  platinum cookies. Uh, isn't that a hybrid? I think that's a hybrid. What about animal
[21:26.990 --> 21:31.990]  cookies? That's a hybrid. Okay. We'll see. I'm glad I brought you guys. Cause you knew
[21:31.990 --> 21:36.990]  some stuff today. Uh, man, you got me thinking about some cookies now. I got a little bit
[21:36.990 --> 21:40.990]  of girl scout cookies hidden away over there. Uh, Jilly bean is something super popular.
[21:40.990 --> 21:44.990]  You always hear about that candy store, Fino and the orange Fino. Uh, there's Chernobyl,
[21:44.990 --> 21:48.990]  the golden ticket, you know, uh, that when you grow my golden goat from seed, you're
[21:48.990 --> 21:53.990]  looking for that golden goat Fino that looks just like mommy, uh, plush Berry. That's a
[21:53.990 --> 21:57.990]  great example. There's a black cherry chem phenotype. And then there's the space queen
[21:57.990 --> 22:03.990]  dominant phenotype and that black cherry chem or no, uh, black cherry soda. Sorry. Black
[22:03.990 --> 22:09.990]  cherry, black cherry soda. Uh, the phenotype that's dominant to that is very noticeable.
[22:09.990 --> 22:14.990]  You'll know if you've got it about 20 days into flower, you can tell, uh, turn off the
[22:14.990 --> 22:18.990]  grow lights and turn on the normal lights and look from the underside of the Calyx and
[22:18.990 --> 22:24.990]  you'll see the purple for sure. Yeah, I do get that. It's got a couple known, uh, phenotypes.
[22:24.990 --> 22:29.990]  Yeah. Uh, DJ shorts. Well, uh, DJ short said that he put that flow out that he released
[22:29.990 --> 22:34.990]  that clone that's in Colorado. He said he let that out to show everybody what was possible
[22:34.990 --> 22:39.990]  with those seats, what the potential of flow was. So that cut that we all have supposedly
[22:39.990 --> 22:44.990]  came from DJ short shout out DJ short. I've learned a lot of stuff from DJ. Yeah. I like
[22:44.990 --> 22:49.990]  that. He's doing the free weed show a lot more. It's so great. The new episodes are
[22:49.990 --> 22:52.990]  fucking awesome. Yeah. Listen to that one. You guys will hear a lot of the, I've learned
[22:52.990 --> 22:56.990]  a lot from just listening to DJ on that show. And it's great to hear that he's not Canadian.
[22:56.990 --> 23:01.990]  He's actually well thought he was from Canada for so many years. It's a boot time. I'm not
[23:01.990 --> 23:07.990]  touching that one. I didn't make fun of anybody. You got something to say, Spence, do it. No,
[23:07.990 --> 23:11.990]  you're all leaned up on the mic. Like you're ready to go. I'm trying to read your question
[23:11.990 --> 23:16.990]  so I can think of some shit to say. Uh, do you, uh, when you grow out of a pack, this
[23:16.990 --> 23:20.990]  is why is variation happening and useful. We talked about kind of why it's happening
[23:20.990 --> 23:24.990]  because we're breeding a male and a female and they're making babies and we don't want
[23:24.990 --> 23:28.990]  all the babies to look the same in the world. That's how plants survive. So how do you find
[23:28.990 --> 23:34.990]  that variation to be useful? Do you want that stuff? Do you want the different phenos? Yeah.
[23:34.990 --> 23:39.990]  I mean, different phenos gives you, you know, you know, like we talked about on a previous
[23:39.990 --> 23:44.990]  episode, we talked about how many phenos you should keep in a seed pack. So, you know,
[23:44.990 --> 23:48.990]  that's where you would want to keep a couple of different ones, especially if it's a seed
[23:48.990 --> 23:53.990]  pack that is a hybrid or, you know, something like that, where you can get multiple variations
[23:53.990 --> 23:58.990]  of your parents. Um, so I enjoy, you know, the different variations, like some plants
[23:58.990 --> 24:03.990]  grow faster, some plants, you know, have more side branching. Um,
[24:04.990 --> 24:10.990]  side branching, you know, some plants grow straight up and some plants, the bottoms grow
[24:10.990 --> 24:16.990]  almost as good as the top does. So, you know, those are the type of plants certain people
[24:16.990 --> 24:21.990]  look for. We need stuff that clones well. And clones well. I'm talking like, well, I
[24:21.990 --> 24:26.990]  got my clone games coming back. I'm coming strong. I really think they did something
[24:26.990 --> 24:30.990]  to the water around here or something. Cause everybody's clones, everybody that I know
[24:30.990 --> 24:34.990]  in this circle of growers was like, I don't, my clones, bro, my clones, bro. I've lost
[24:34.990 --> 24:39.990]  the trees of clones, small trees, my games back on like spend set. But for a minute there,
[24:39.990 --> 24:43.990]  there were some, I was calling, we were all calling each other like, yo, you got some
[24:43.990 --> 24:48.990]  clones. We're all getting back on it. Yeah. What, what was going on? It had to be something
[24:48.990 --> 24:53.990]  in the water, something in the water. So it seems like every year this happens about this
[24:53.990 --> 24:57.990]  time. It's good to know. And also if you guys are indoor growers in Colorado, be prepared
[24:58.990 --> 25:01.990]  to be fucked for a couple of months because nobody's going to want to buy your product
[25:01.990 --> 25:06.990]  because I've seen an outdoor crop in every other yard in Colorado the past few weeks.
[25:06.990 --> 25:12.990]  Yep. It's been sunny and everyone's out playing with their trees. Yeah. So good luck. You
[25:12.990 --> 25:15.990]  guys are hustling. The dispensaries are going to slow down a little pump. That's bullshit.
[25:15.990 --> 25:19.990]  Nevermind. I can't believe I haven't thought that would happen. Yes. I just been through
[25:19.990 --> 25:24.990]  the other day with a really big outdoor grow looking pretty nice. So yeah. Yeah. I think
[25:24.990 --> 25:27.990]  I've seen some pictures of that. That thing looks pretty damn killer. Yeah. Yeah. That's
[25:27.990 --> 25:32.990]  a really neat greenhouse. A lot of really cool fluorescent lights. I said, I talked
[25:32.990 --> 25:35.990]  about that place on the show. If anybody's gone by and taking cool pictures of that greenhouse
[25:35.990 --> 25:41.990]  I talked about tweet me some pictures. I'd love to see it. It was my idea. We went, we
[25:41.990 --> 25:46.990]  saw it the night of Jesse's wedding and it was awesome. That was really great. How often
[25:46.990 --> 25:54.990]  do you get to do a Fino hunt bro? Um, not as often as I'd like to. I wish I could grow
[25:54.990 --> 25:59.990]  from seed every single time, but I have some other plants I have to maintain and you know,
[25:59.990 --> 26:07.990]  best way to do that is clone and run clones and you know, it keeps reliable medicine for
[26:07.990 --> 26:11.990]  the patients and that's what we all need. I'm a, this winter I'm planning on growing
[26:11.990 --> 26:16.990]  pretty much exclusively seed. So other than just mother maintenance. So have you ever
[26:16.990 --> 26:23.990]  ran a whole pack of seeds and not gotten anything worth keeping? Yes. Me too. You? Yes. You're
[26:23.990 --> 26:27.990]  running, you've, your shop's got a nice amount of seeds going right now. I bet you've got
[26:27.990 --> 26:31.990]  high hopes for that. There's a, there's a lot of different ones going on in there too.
[26:31.990 --> 26:34.990]  So it's very exciting. If you don't find a couple of keepers of each one, it's going
[26:34.990 --> 26:38.990]  to feel like a lot of work for nothing. Well already it's looking like there's a couple
[26:38.990 --> 26:42.990]  that are setting themselves apart from the others. So it's pretty promising. And how
[26:42.990 --> 26:47.990]  many, um, how many days in are those? They are, they're in bed still. So how long have
[26:47.990 --> 26:50.990]  they been there? I think they're on day 23 in veg. They look good in your pictures on
[26:50.990 --> 26:53.990]  Instagram. They look great. Check them out guys. He looks great on Instagram. He's got
[26:53.990 --> 26:59.990]  some stylish glass and some stylish plants and he takes the biggest dives. What? Yeah.
[26:59.990 --> 27:04.990]  Oh, we were at a dab competition. Wait, what? No, no, no. That's a good idea. I think it
[27:04.990 --> 27:07.990]  just might be a friendly, uh, it's a personal challenge. Personal challenge. We were, uh,
[27:07.990 --> 27:11.990]  I was talking on an episode, it might've been the last one that I'm going to put the
[27:11.990 --> 27:16.990]  gigantic dab thing to a rest for myself because I'm getting old. I know how you feel. You
[27:16.990 --> 27:20.990]  know what I mean? That is rough. It's, it takes a little bit of effort and it kind of,
[27:20.990 --> 27:24.990]  if you, uh, if you do it in the mid afternoon and you don't plan it right, you can ruin
[27:24.990 --> 27:28.990]  your whole day. There's only so many times you can do a gram dab and survive. You know,
[27:28.990 --> 27:32.990]  I said, I think what I actually said was that my lungs, I've realized my lungs have so many
[27:33.990 --> 27:37.990]  inhales and exhales and I think taking a gram dab, it's just like you're just using up cat
[27:37.990 --> 27:41.990]  lives when you do that. That was 32 breaths you could have had, but instead you smoked
[27:41.990 --> 27:46.990]  a gram of hash. That's kind of how I feel about it. Well, if you're going to waste 32
[27:46.990 --> 27:57.990]  breasts, I don't waste any breasts, especially that many, but I mean, which better way to
[27:57.990 --> 28:01.990]  do it than taking a hit at a hash. At least you weren't breathing in concrete dust or
[28:01.990 --> 28:05.990]  something. You know, I've done that before and I can do best or something like that.
[28:05.990 --> 28:11.990]  Yeah, I definitely prefer the dabs. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. That music got really loud for
[28:11.990 --> 28:15.990]  a second. That might've been my fault. Do you guys want to give a shout out to this
[28:15.990 --> 28:20.990]  hash that we're hitting here? That it's tasty. It's a tricot, heavy extracts. Yeah, it's
[28:20.990 --> 28:25.990]  good work guys. For sure. Hell yeah. Off the Hale and Honey hole even shout out to Spence
[28:25.990 --> 28:29.990]  for bringing the Hale and Honey hole. That was dope. Oh yeah, that was on point. All
[28:29.990 --> 28:33.990]  right. This conversation has gotten off track cause I'm dabbed out. What else do we want
[28:33.990 --> 28:37.990]  to talk about about phenotypes you guys? Okay. I got a question. I like it. Ooh, purple.
[28:37.990 --> 28:45.990]  What is, what are bag seeds considered? Like seeds you find in like- Mostly S ones I would
[28:45.990 --> 28:49.990]  say. You would say they're not considered S ones. Since you don't know the parent, yeah,
[28:49.990 --> 28:53.990]  it's probably just an S one. Well, what if, well, you know the parent if you get the seeds
[28:53.990 --> 28:57.990]  out of them, but you don't know what the male was sometimes. Yeah. That's what I'm
[28:57.990 --> 29:02.990]  saying. What if it's, have you ever heard of plants like are slightly humming? Yeah,
[29:02.990 --> 29:07.990]  slightly humming and seeding the plant and then taking the seed from there and growing
[29:07.990 --> 29:12.990]  that. Well, what would that be? That's an S one. That's a, that's how Soma, sorry Soma,
[29:12.990 --> 29:16.990]  I'm spilling your beans. That's how Soma actually makes feminized seeds. He takes a female and
[29:16.990 --> 29:20.990]  flowers her for too long. Okay. And then after she goes, like if you got a nine week strain,
[29:20.990 --> 29:25.990]  he lets it go for 13 and about week 13 it'll start spitting out pollen. Okay. And then
[29:25.990 --> 29:29.990]  he gathers that and throws it on the next crop that he makes. Okay. So then he can-
[29:29.990 --> 29:32.990]  Have you, I'm sorry. Oh, then he says he can smoke those butts too. Yeah. Because he can
[29:32.990 --> 29:36.990]  cut down most of the plant and just leave enough of it to herm out and spit out pollen
[29:36.990 --> 29:39.990]  and then he can smoke the rest. Even if you can't smoke it, you can definitely probably
[29:39.990 --> 29:45.990]  extract it. There you go. Yeah. Have you heard of his fire technique? Oh yeah. Heat stress
[29:45.990 --> 29:50.990]  to get the plants out. That's a little weird to me. Yeah. Makes sense. I mean, I guess
[29:50.990 --> 29:55.990]  I understand the theory where he's coming from with the forest fire. His method is more
[29:55.990 --> 30:01.990]  organic than mine. So that's a, that's pretty hardcore. Yeah. You don't want to smoke the
[30:01.990 --> 30:05.990]  flowers of the plants that I have reversed. You don't want to smoke those. You can smoke
[30:05.990 --> 30:09.990]  his. For sure. You don't want to smoke mine. I don't think I would. I wouldn't encourage
[30:10.990 --> 30:14.990]  it. Yeah. Yeah. They've been sprayed with chemicals that I don't trust smoking. Yeah.
[30:14.990 --> 30:20.990]  Chemdog was bag seed guys. So don't ever doubt bag seed. I mean, I've seen some great- I've
[30:20.990 --> 30:26.990]  had great bag seeds. I've had some crazy looking stuff from bag seeds and I don't ever- And
[30:26.990 --> 30:32.990]  it could be an F2. You could experience transgressive segregation. It could outperform its parents.
[30:32.990 --> 30:36.990]  Just like that. It will because you don't know what the parents were. It's hard to be
[30:36.990 --> 30:43.990]  Well, you know, the person who was managing the room could have a good idea. Probably
[30:43.990 --> 30:49.990]  that's about, I mean, I've seen people on Instagram sell packs of S1s for a hundred
[30:49.990 --> 30:56.990]  bucks. Yeah. One of those forum sites I saw a pack of S1s go for like fricking eight grand
[30:56.990 --> 31:00.990]  one time. Yeah. I've seen some old seeds go for ridiculous money. Some OG rascal stuff
[31:00.990 --> 31:06.990]  in a forum went for a really high price recently. His, when I went to Cali, I met up with another
[31:06.990 --> 31:11.990]  person through Instagram and stuff and they had a, the fire, the original fire OG cut
[31:11.990 --> 31:16.990]  from rascal. And they said it was 20 Gs is how much it cost. That's an expensive clone.
[31:16.990 --> 31:19.990]  Yes. That's an expensive clone. What are you dabbing over there, Buster? If you have it,
[31:19.990 --> 31:24.990]  it's worth it though. I'm doing a little bit of a lemon cookies from JP Wellness. Nice.
[31:24.990 --> 31:28.990]  Full melt. Lemon cookies, full melt. Shout out to JP Wellness. I heard a lot of good
[31:28.990 --> 31:32.990]  things about that place. Oh, Spence, you're ringing. Just cancel it. It's cool. Yeah.
[31:32.990 --> 31:36.990]  If you're up in the Springs, check them out. They got pretty good extracts. I'm going to
[31:36.990 --> 31:39.990]  try to cut that out of there. Sorry. That's a torch you guys, if you're wondering. It's
[31:39.990 --> 31:43.990]  time for me to take a dab too. I'm going to take a sip of something and take a dab. Anybody
[31:43.990 --> 31:50.990]  got anything snazzy to say? Cheers to good weed. Hell yeah. Yeah. Snazzy weed. You got
[31:50.990 --> 31:57.990]  anything longer to say? Are you working on any, any breeding projects right now, Jesse?
[31:57.990 --> 32:03.990]  Yes. What do you got going on in your, in your project? I am, like I was saying, I'm
[32:03.990 --> 32:09.990]  really happy with the BX3 of a depot dog. So I think I'm going to make a whole bunch
[32:09.990 --> 32:16.990]  of seed of it and maybe get it to the public. So we'll see. I know a way you can make that
[32:16.990 --> 32:20.990]  happen. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Tell them what the cross is on the depot dog again so they
[32:21.990 --> 32:30.990]  can get them excited. It's a old school Amsterdam. I don't really have a whole lot of heritage
[32:30.990 --> 32:36.990]  on it, but it's a, I don't know the producer of it, but it was a skunk haze. I believe
[32:36.990 --> 32:43.990]  it was a freebie from an old Amsterdam seed pack, but had really, really early resin production
[32:44.990 --> 32:51.990]  and it was a skunk haze. So the initial reason I used it in the cross was he was very different
[32:51.990 --> 32:57.990]  than Kim D and it was very easy to spot out the phenotypes that were leaning harder towards
[32:57.990 --> 33:03.990]  him. So I kind of used it as a tool to make the Kim line more pure. I'm so glad that Kim
[33:03.990 --> 33:12.990]  was discovered. Yes. Yes. That's my favorite, favorite strain. I need it. Kim four back.
[33:13.990 --> 33:20.990]  Bad Kim D even so anybody out there, it's got a killing camera for Kim D for Jesse.
[33:20.990 --> 33:26.990]  We can trade. We can trade. If you're in Colorado and you're an adult, we can do this. Maybe
[33:26.990 --> 33:31.990]  we can find some seeds or something for you. I've got a, I've got a pretty cool girl scout
[33:31.990 --> 33:37.990]  cookie Scott. So a lot of people are thirsty for that cookie still. I've heard. I've got
[33:37.990 --> 33:45.990]  the gorilla glue for, and I've got platinum OG, so let's talk. I wonder if ours is the
[33:45.990 --> 33:49.990]  same. We'll see. Our gorilla glues. Yeah. Yeah. We should trade cuts. Cause there's
[33:49.990 --> 33:54.990]  different phenotypes of that. Isn't there? Yeah. There's a more sour, diesel-y one. And
[33:54.990 --> 34:03.990]  then there's one that has more of that chocolate tie that's in it. What is girl scout? We've
[34:04.990 --> 34:10.990]  moved on. It's we should make girl glue. We should breed those. Um, it is be prepared.
[34:10.990 --> 34:16.990]  Hold on. Let me think about it. Spence. No, I know. It's like, it's like a bug. Sour
[34:16.990 --> 34:24.990]  sour, sour, dub, chocolate tie and chocolate tie. Something else sounds tasty. Something
[34:24.990 --> 34:31.990]  else. And very lanky. I can already tell him that those bitches are lanky. Yeah. Those
[34:31.990 --> 34:36.990]  are taller than everybody else already. I've, uh, the ones I've seen, uh, pretty easy to
[34:36.990 --> 34:41.990]  point out and they're real bushy and stuff. Yeah. Or not. Yeah. I guess bushy lankiness.
[34:41.990 --> 34:45.990]  Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. They grow with more vigor than a lot of the other sounds
[34:45.990 --> 34:53.990]  in my room. Yeah. Whoa. Sorry. Got a text coming in. His phone is not really advanced
[34:53.990 --> 34:59.990]  is the word. It may be an antique. Uh, two and a half years in the phone world. That's
[34:59.990 --> 35:04.990]  an antique. Yeah. It kind of makes a lot of weird noises. All right. So, uh, yeah,
[35:04.990 --> 35:07.990]  that was a good rant about Finos because that gorilla glue, what's the other number there's
[35:07.990 --> 35:11.990]  four and what's the other one just for is all I've heard of. Uh, there's like a seven
[35:11.990 --> 35:15.990]  or a three or some shit that I've heard about. Yeah. We need cuts of that one so we can compare
[35:15.990 --> 35:19.990]  them. You guys find us. Yeah. I really want to try that. Yeah. I've got a lot of great
[35:19.990 --> 35:25.990]  shit for trade. We'll be bringing a Tangy to Southern Colorado soon. So not the tanj
[35:25.990 --> 35:29.990]  cause there's a strain that everyone calls the tanj that is not tangy. It doesn't taste
[35:29.990 --> 35:34.990]  like any goddamn tangerines or anything. Zero oranges. Yeah. Why'd you call that the tanj?
[35:34.990 --> 35:40.990]  What are you doing? I think it's flow. God damn it. Uh, pretty close. Yeah. I think it's
[35:40.990 --> 35:52.990]  flow. Quit trying to front. Um, what are you growing now, bro? Uh, platinum cookies,
[35:52.990 --> 35:59.990]  animal cookies, gorilla glue, moonshine, Hayes, cookies and cream. Everyone's cookie crazy
[35:59.990 --> 36:03.990]  cookies and cream that won the cup. And whoever took that name, cookies and cream. I wanted
[36:04.990 --> 36:11.990]  that. Yeah, that was it. But it's, has anybody ever smoked starfighter or anything? Starfighter
[36:11.990 --> 36:17.990]  the star for your F2? Okay. Okay. I figured it is bomb. I just don't know. I've never
[36:17.990 --> 36:24.990]  smoked it. So starfighter is that rare dinkness or is that exotic genetics? Oh, I remember
[36:25.990 --> 36:32.990]  talking about that. Pack of seed does not go for a lot of money. Yeah. But that and
[36:32.990 --> 36:38.990]  then end those cush is what I've got going. And then I have a Fino hunt going right now
[36:38.990 --> 36:44.990]  by the way. Um, which sucks everybody. If you have timers that have more than one program,
[36:44.990 --> 36:49.990]  make sure you go through your programs and make sure there's no extra timers chilling.
[36:49.990 --> 36:54.990]  So it's cool. You can catch it, but I caught it. Thank God. You almost flower. Huh? Did
[36:54.990 --> 36:59.990]  you almost, Oh, I was almost on flowered. I'm almost on flowered. Oh shit. So I had
[36:59.990 --> 37:03.990]  to like, well I was my room. Some plants look good. So I don't really know. Like it's, I
[37:03.990 --> 37:08.990]  saw a wrong timer, but it was just weird cause there was no off timer. It's just on, but
[37:08.990 --> 37:13.990]  I've been in my room and it's not on. I assume with those fancy digital timers. Yeah. I'm
[37:13.990 --> 37:17.990]  going to. So when you reset your time, a guy just reset it. The whole thing is like, yeah,
[37:17.990 --> 37:21.990]  I just did reset and clear it out. Don't just try to go and reset everything. Actually
[37:21.990 --> 37:25.990]  hit the button, default that bitch. But I think there'll be fine. I've got a couple
[37:25.990 --> 37:29.990]  that are just growing right through it and it didn't matter to it. So I'm kind of happy
[37:29.990 --> 37:37.990]  with those. What light cycle are you running? You doing the 12, 12 or 11, 13? 12, 12. Uh,
[37:37.990 --> 37:40.990]  that's actually a good way to stress test your plants. I was mentioning this. This is
[37:40.990 --> 37:44.990]  a, since our Fino topic kind of got side rails here, we ran out of shit to talk about. I
[37:44.990 --> 37:50.990]  think, uh, I stress test my plants before I breed with them. I'll take a female and
[37:50.990 --> 37:53.990]  put her in a room. I'll take a bunch of them. Like I've got four or five new clones. I'll
[37:53.990 --> 37:58.990]  put them in the room and I'll run it on 12, 12 for two weeks. And then about day 15 I'll
[37:58.990 --> 38:02.990]  turn it off for 24 hours, day 15 I'll turn it on for 24 hours and then I'll put it back
[38:02.990 --> 38:06.990]  on the opposite 12, 12. So if I was coming on at 10 in the morning, now I'm coming on
[38:06.990 --> 38:10.990]  at 10 at night and I'll run that for a few more days, you know, and just watch them grow
[38:10.990 --> 38:14.990]  and then I'll kind of freak out and then I'll put it back into the normal flower cycle
[38:14.990 --> 38:19.990]  and that really pisses off normal plants and you will see a lot of things start to throw
[38:19.990 --> 38:23.990]  nanners and become a hermaphrodite. You'll see which ones really are. And don't breed
[38:23.990 --> 38:26.990]  with them if they throw those bananas on you because those are going to be hermaphrodites
[38:26.990 --> 38:30.990]  in the future that'll cause you problems. Betrayed your passion. Yeah. Same goes for
[38:30.990 --> 38:34.990]  males, but I don't want to give away too many secrets so we'll just leave it at that. I
[38:34.990 --> 38:38.990]  like how you figured it out yourself. Yeah. Male stuff is all, that's all proprietary
[38:38.990 --> 38:43.990]  stuff that you keep on the down low. Wow. Give them that at least. Don't want people
[38:43.990 --> 38:48.990]  breeding with a bunch of hermed ass males. No, nor the females. Yeah. Yeah. You can usually
[38:48.990 --> 38:52.990]  spot a nice hermed male. The top clusters are too close together and they look like
[38:52.990 --> 38:55.990]  they got fur between them and start to look like a, like a pussy willow or something.
[38:55.990 --> 39:00.990]  A foxtail sort of. Yeah. That's a nice hermed out male. You can tell by that shit. You just
[39:00.990 --> 39:04.990]  want those big juicy balls and I will never say that ever.
[39:04.990 --> 39:11.990]  We'll talk about what kind of traits we look for in a male in another episode. Jesse will
[39:11.990 --> 39:13.990]  come. No, we won't.
[39:16.990 --> 39:21.990]  No, we totally, I guess we'll maybe eventually like on episode like 500 once everyone's
[39:21.990 --> 39:23.990]  listened for a long time and loves us. What are you doing over there? Spence? That looks
[39:23.990 --> 39:29.990]  dangerous. This is made in Peru. All right. That is fire and plastic. He just puts it
[39:29.990 --> 39:34.990]  down. Like I already know how this shit ends. Ends with us outside staring at the house
[39:34.990 --> 39:43.990]  going, that sucked. All right. So we've been going for a while. We've been at it for 35
[39:43.990 --> 39:46.990]  minutes. You guys got anything you want to talk about on a podcast? Anything you've ever
[39:46.990 --> 39:54.990]  wanted to say? No. Everyone just kind of shakes their head and goes, nah, bro. We're good.
[39:54.990 --> 39:58.990]  I did have one side note back to the, the female hunting. That's good because that's
[39:58.990 --> 40:03.990]  what everybody came to this show for. One big thing I look for is I grow mostly indoors,
[40:03.990 --> 40:07.990]  so I like to have plants that respond well to topping and super cropping so I can get
[40:07.990 --> 40:12.990]  a nice even canopy versus having a lot of lower growth and certain trains really don't
[40:12.990 --> 40:20.990]  like topping. Oh, I remember. Purple. That's phenotypic expressions. That is a very phenotypical
[40:20.990 --> 40:27.990]  expression. So things like purpling, even some strains, it's kind of a, cause if you
[40:27.990 --> 40:31.990]  have an unhealthy plant, they'll have purple stems too. But I have seen healthy plants
[40:31.990 --> 40:37.990]  that just have purple stems. Girl Scout cookies. Purple's up completely. You can't do nothing
[40:37.990 --> 40:42.990]  about it. Girl Scout cookies gets black and gets purple. Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. It's
[40:42.990 --> 40:46.990]  a black leaf, black leaf company or black leaf society. There it is. Black leaf society.
[40:46.990 --> 40:52.990]  I might've had a couple dabs. That's a hashtag. That is a hashtag. Check it out. It's good.
[40:52.990 --> 40:56.990]  It's a lot of cookie shots. You might find some of my cookies on there. Yeah. I think
[40:56.990 --> 41:04.390]  that's all of ours. No. Spence had something really great to say and then backed up from
[41:04.390 --> 41:09.390]  the microphone and backed out. Or nah. Or nah. It's all right. You don't have to say
[41:09.390 --> 41:15.390]  it. I don't know. Okay. The notes are done, bro. We said all the stuff on my notes. You're
[41:15.390 --> 41:19.390]  looking over here like, what can we say? Oh, I know. You had some of your thinking? Like
[41:19.390 --> 41:25.390]  a press pause while you think. Don't be a scared to kill your red hair buds. Oh, did
[41:25.390 --> 41:29.390]  you guys hear that? Michael's taking a dab. He said, don't be afraid to kill off those
[41:29.390 --> 41:36.390]  plants that are not performing. When I do phenotypes or pheno hunts, I usually do probably
[41:36.390 --> 41:41.390]  like a couple of seed packs, not just one. And it's kind of survival of the fittest for
[41:41.390 --> 41:46.390]  me because seeds, I like to not really like feed them too much. I kind of like to just
[41:46.390 --> 41:51.390]  let them see which ones are going to do their thing until I have to start giving them food.
[41:51.390 --> 41:55.390]  Um, so yeah, like I kill ones that if you're, if it's going to get overgrown as a seed,
[41:55.390 --> 41:59.390]  it's probably going to get overgrown as a plant. So I just get rid of it. Right. Um,
[41:59.390 --> 42:03.390]  and there's nothing wrong with getting rid of it. It just makes your hunt smaller and
[42:03.390 --> 42:07.390]  more. Now you can focus on other things instead of now you have one less plant. Yeah. It's
[42:07.390 --> 42:11.390]  like picking players for the team. You don't want those slow runners or the guy that can't
[42:11.390 --> 42:15.390]  shoot. You don't want me on your team. You want a lot of spits. I'll take you. Take me
[42:15.390 --> 42:19.390]  on your team. I can block bro. That's what I'm saying. Just stay in there. Right in front
[42:19.390 --> 42:24.390]  of the hoop. Just go. Just both of us. Just like nobody's doing it. We're both about six,
[42:24.390 --> 42:30.390]  five issue. If you're wondering why we were talking about sports on a weed podcast events,
[42:30.390 --> 42:34.390]  you're doing a secret cup. See you there. I should be at the secret cup. I think I'm
[42:34.390 --> 42:39.390]  going with a low cab, so that should be a good time when I think that September 27th.
[42:39.390 --> 42:44.390]  Okay. That's good. Cause I had something else going on in September. Uh, since you're a
[42:44.390 --> 42:48.390]  plan with that carb cap, we're going to give a huge shout out to the man task rock. These,
[42:48.390 --> 42:53.390]  uh, blue carb caps, these new color titanium pieces are dope. Y'all don't even know about
[42:53.390 --> 42:56.390]  this shit right here. Yeah. We got that new, new, this episode's coming out. We're pre
[42:56.390 --> 43:00.390]  recording this one because I was out of town when we should have recorded this. So, uh,
[43:00.390 --> 43:05.390]  we're pre recording, but, uh, this stuff is new and they look good, bro. The color is
[43:05.390 --> 43:10.390]  not coming off. It's looks just like the other carb caps. I like it. Good work brother.
[43:10.390 --> 43:18.390]  Shout out task rock and highly educated titanium. Yeah. Is that a anodized? Is it? I think that's
[43:18.390 --> 43:22.390]  the word, but I'm not certain. For sure. Take it with heat and change the color. Don't it
[43:22.390 --> 43:26.390]  turn like a rainbow color when you do that? There'd be a little more variation in it.
[43:26.390 --> 43:31.390]  I believe if that was the process, I'll ask him so that way we know since, uh, but yeah,
[43:31.390 --> 43:38.390]  that's anodized. I mean, I have no doubt task is a, you know, putting out top quality shit.
[43:38.390 --> 43:46.390]  So he's got a very high quality energization process in some spots. It could just be me,
[43:46.390 --> 43:51.390]  but I've seen so many people that look like tasks. Yeah. I feel like people like dressing
[43:51.390 --> 43:56.390]  up like cash. I think it was a task, but just jeans and a t-shirt, bro. That's not really
[43:56.390 --> 44:01.390]  an outfit or a costume. Oh shit. Here's a good size dab. Damn. That's a big old water
[44:01.390 --> 44:05.390]  hashtag. Uh, yeah, I'll take that one. I'm going to let Spence go ahead and heat up the
[44:05.390 --> 44:10.390]  honey hole for me. The Hale and honey hole. Hey guys, thanks for bearing with a bunch
[44:10.390 --> 44:14.390]  of potheads. I know we tried to have a phenotype discussion. It feels like we covered a lot.
[44:14.390 --> 44:21.390]  Let's see if we can name off any other, uh, famous or even some of your own, uh, heart
[44:21.390 --> 44:29.390]  of gold. Uh, that's got a real, um, it's a more of a question, but I'm growing out a
[44:29.390 --> 44:35.390]  grape Samparo G and does anyone know of any popular phenotype variation of that? There's
[44:35.390 --> 44:41.390]  one that actually tastes real grapey. That Spence loves a super grapey phenotype. Uh,
[44:41.390 --> 44:46.390]  and it almost looks when the buds start to grow, they're real dense and they look furry.
[44:46.390 --> 44:51.390]  Like, yeah, there's, yeah, that's the one that I really liked a whole lot of hairs,
[44:51.390 --> 44:56.390]  a whole lot of, uh, not even more just, yeah, kind of try call me and just, it's got a real
[44:56.390 --> 45:00.390]  rigid structure. It just looks real crazy in the texture of the buds themselves. All
[45:00.390 --> 45:03.390]  right guys, I won't be talking. So hopefully one of these guys covers the dead airspace
[45:03.390 --> 45:08.390]  while I take this stab and then I'll correct the radio silence. All three of us just looked
[45:08.390 --> 45:15.390]  at each other like, Oh shit. Jeff totally leads the conversation for us. Have any of
[45:15.390 --> 45:20.390]  you guys ever had seeds that you grew and didn't take clones on and it ended up being
[45:20.390 --> 45:26.390]  like some really, really good shit and you drive. I think all of us have experienced
[45:26.390 --> 45:31.390]  that. Yeah. Right on for the stab. There are many fish in the ocean, but yeah, I lost a,
[45:31.390 --> 45:40.390]  uh, um, alien dog, Fino that was really bomb. Real sad about that. It was from a private
[45:40.390 --> 45:47.390]  breeder though. It wasn't the, uh, alien dog that, um, that is from a very popular breeder.
[45:48.390 --> 45:57.390]  I recently lost my, uh, flow strain. I think everyone in this room has that. Oh, I know.
[45:57.390 --> 46:01.390]  I'm going to get it back, but what am I going to have to get up now? That's a good dad.
[46:01.390 --> 46:09.390]  Thank you. Wow. I had, uh, I grew DNA genetics, Holy grail, Kush from seed and it was fire.
[46:09.390 --> 46:13.390]  If you guys are looking for a dank, sneaky Kush, that's mostly Indica that'll just set
[46:13.390 --> 46:19.390]  you down and tastes like stinky skunky feet. Uh, it's harder to grow. It's a bitch to grow
[46:19.390 --> 46:24.390]  and it will not clone. Uh, I try, I gave cuts to other people. They couldn't get it to clone,
[46:24.390 --> 46:29.390]  but that stuff was awesome. The DNA genetics, Holy grail, Kush. It just wouldn't. I don't
[46:29.390 --> 46:34.390]  even know if you can get that. I've got a pack of it. There's a, he just released a
[46:34.390 --> 46:40.390]  whole bunch of them, I think, but, well, I had a, a lemon skunk that, uh, from, uh, from
[46:41.390 --> 46:47.390]  Aryan. Yeah, sure. I wasn't going to name him, but it was a good phenotype. Um, that's
[46:47.390 --> 46:54.390]  what I lost it. Oh, okay. I thought she had the DNA one. I think they're pretty much the
[46:54.390 --> 47:02.390]  same thing. Anybody seen? Okay. So would, no, this is a stupid question. Are we still
[47:02.390 --> 47:05.390]  recording? We're still totally recording. Okay. I'm going to ask this stupid question
[47:05.390 --> 47:08.390]  anyway, but I don't know. I'll let you do shout out to the NCL. No, it's over. I don't
[47:08.390 --> 47:16.390]  know if it is a stupid question. So OGs are not a phenotype. They are like, it would be
[47:16.390 --> 47:24.390]  a gene. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Uh, lately I think OG is just a sticker used by a dispensary
[47:24.390 --> 47:31.390]  or a seed breeder for dollar signs. Very well put. Yeah. I've seen every true OGs like the,
[47:32.390 --> 47:37.390]  you know, uh, OG Kush. Yeah. The original ones, those are Walker. Yeah. From, according
[47:37.390 --> 47:42.390]  to the story, there's a bunch of different phenotypes of the genotype. I don't know. Um,
[47:42.390 --> 47:49.390]  underdog. That's a good story. That's I really think there's two underdogs and both of them
[47:49.390 --> 47:54.390]  are pretty well known. So you guys got to speak in an OG Kush. I'm going to shout out
[47:54.390 --> 48:00.390]  another podcast. It's called the Adam Dunn show. They did an episode all about OG Kush.
[48:00.390 --> 48:03.390]  I haven't listened to that yet. I went up today. I have not had a chance to listen.
[48:03.390 --> 48:07.390]  It's not on iTunes right now. They're having a little problem, but you can listen to them.
[48:07.390 --> 48:12.390]  They're on YouTube. It's YouTube. And I think it's I cannabis radio.com and you can either
[48:12.390 --> 48:18.390]  run recorded shows on a, I can have a stock. And those guys talk about a lot of great shit
[48:18.390 --> 48:23.390]  on YouTube is the Adam Dunn show. Yeah. Shout out to Adam Dunn and mentioned also, they
[48:23.390 --> 48:27.390]  probably don't listen to our show because they have their own, but they get a lot of
[48:27.390 --> 48:30.390]  cool guests on because they're in Denver and because Adam's got a seed company that
[48:30.390 --> 48:35.390]  is very well known from the Denver. So Mitch seems to be pretty well connected. I have
[48:35.390 --> 48:41.390]  a new book out, which is great. Check out Mitch. Uh, Shanasa's new book, the cannabis
[48:41.390 --> 48:47.390]  aficionados handbook. I believe it's called. Yeah, correct. Yeah. I'm good. My, my pothead
[48:47.390 --> 48:52.390]  memory just pulled that out of nowhere. It's easy to remember pothead things. Have you
[48:53.390 --> 48:59.390]  ever grown any TH seeds? Uh, no, not actually. Oh wait, wait, wait. Um, yeah, I grew sage
[48:59.390 --> 49:05.390]  and sour as a freebie. Okay. I didn't really like it. That was just my opinion. I've, I've
[49:05.390 --> 49:09.390]  heard that called old man's weed. So there you go. Okay. That makes sense. I wasn't ever
[49:09.390 --> 49:16.390]  a fan of the sage and it won cups. Yeah. Sage. I did like it. I know it's an acronym, but
[49:16.390 --> 49:23.390]  it does have a, a, a sagey, uh, I think it's mental probably now. Like it's, everybody
[49:23.390 --> 49:31.390]  says that probably. Well, even if it is, I don't like it. Yeah. Yeah. That's I like cush
[49:31.390 --> 49:39.390]  and I haven't, I say I've never smoked it like a true Kim or a really, really good sour.
[49:39.390 --> 49:43.390]  I smoked some sours, but not like there's a sour diesel cut that goes around here.
[49:43.390 --> 49:46.390]  Have you ever smoked any of that? I think I grew it. I grew it and I smoked it. It's
[49:46.390 --> 49:52.390]  just, there wasn't a fan of it. Um, I don't know. I might be looking for a different soury
[49:52.390 --> 50:03.390]  taste, but I've had, I work where I work at. We have one still haven't smoked it. Um, it's,
[50:03.390 --> 50:08.390]  it's pretty good. It's pretty good for sour diesel. Is that the G diesel? Yeah. Yeah.
[50:08.390 --> 50:12.390]  That's the one. Yeah. That you'll like that. You'll love that. That's dank. When it's done
[50:12.390 --> 50:17.390]  well, that stuff is, you know, actually the, uh, my friend Josh from La Plata labs rolled
[50:17.390 --> 50:21.390]  a joint of that shit one night at a party and there were a bunch of breeders in the
[50:21.390 --> 50:25.390]  room and they all gathered around that joint. Yeah. So for a bunch of breeders to jump on
[50:25.390 --> 50:31.390]  your joint, uh, no, no, that was not mine. Was, uh, I was hoping to hear that Fino was
[50:31.390 --> 50:37.390]  more of a so-called thing. It's a, well actually it was Durango is where they're from. So it's
[50:38.390 --> 50:47.390]  yeah. That's nice. Shout out La Plata. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't been back in 13 years. Regrettably.
[50:47.390 --> 50:51.390]  Um, every summer I plan a trip over there and it never happens, but, um, I'm totally
[50:51.390 --> 50:55.390]  gone cruise through their shop when I do get over there. It's hard to do it being an outdoor
[50:55.390 --> 51:02.390]  farmer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a long drive. Jesse brought me some eggs and, uh, I cracked
[51:02.390 --> 51:07.390]  open one of those eggs and it almost freaked me out because the, was it not crazy? Dude.
[51:07.390 --> 51:13.390]  Oh man. It was like just two times, three times as fast as supposed to be. We think
[51:13.390 --> 51:18.390]  it's supposed to be. And they taste so much better. Like it's store eggs make me nauseous
[51:18.390 --> 51:23.390]  when I eat them. Like, Oh God, I can't believe I decided to cook this. That's factory farming
[51:23.390 --> 51:28.390]  too. So Jesse's eggs taste like food and it seemed like I was supposed to be eating it.
[51:28.390 --> 51:32.390]  And then he brought me tomatoes. And honestly, after eating Jesse's tomatoes, I can't even
[51:32.390 --> 51:37.390]  go buy a tomato anywhere. I got food in Denver the other night and they came with fresh tomatoes
[51:37.390 --> 51:41.390]  and I bit into the tomatoes and they taste like soggy mold. Uh, I am spoiled by Jesse's
[51:41.390 --> 51:47.390]  organic tomatoes. There is a deli downtown called Schlepp's that has my produce there.
[51:47.390 --> 51:54.390]  So shout out to them. Bomb ass food. Buy local produce in Pueblo. Grow your own veggies.
[51:55.390 --> 52:00.390]  They're on main street. And then I launched a bingo burger today and someone is supplying
[52:00.390 --> 52:04.390]  them with some bomb ass fucking produce too. Nice. Yeah. The bingo burger usually does
[52:04.390 --> 52:08.390]  pretty well. Yeah. That's good stuff. Very good place to eat. Yeah. So that's a free
[52:08.390 --> 52:12.390]  commercial for bingo burger from a bunch of potheads. If you're a vegetarian, get that,
[52:12.390 --> 52:18.390]  uh, that mushroom burger. That's pretty tasty. You eat fish. You know, I've said that I won't
[52:18.390 --> 52:23.390]  eat fish anymore recently, but I may. What you got in mind? I'm just asking. They have
[52:23.390 --> 52:29.390]  a banging ass salmon burgers. When I ordered it, I was like, I ordered it and I was like,
[52:29.390 --> 52:33.390]  hold up. I need to go ask him if it's a filet or if it's like a patty. Yeah. I was like,
[52:33.390 --> 52:37.390]  so yo, is this a patty like salmon patty? She's like, no, it's a filet. I was like,
[52:37.390 --> 52:42.390]  all right, cool. Let's do this. I saw that on the menu today, but I already decided what
[52:42.390 --> 52:48.390]  I was going to get. It's with green onions, avocado, tomato, lettuce, pesto sauce. And
[52:48.390 --> 52:52.390]  then you get like a whole wheat grain bun. Damn. You know what I'm saying? Everybody
[52:52.390 --> 52:56.390]  listening right now. I just got the money. We've been all taking dabs. I'm talking about
[52:56.390 --> 53:01.390]  growing weed and now Spence just killed everybody. You've got the munchies. We know where all
[53:01.390 --> 53:05.390]  the best food in Pueblo is. Yeah. The potheads know where to eat. If you're a vegetarian,
[53:05.390 --> 53:10.390]  there's like four spots. That sucks. I really feel bad for you. Just cook. Yeah. Totally
[53:10.390 --> 53:14.390]  makes you just cook at home. Makes me want to open a vegetarian restaurant though. Some
[53:14.390 --> 53:18.390]  of us would appreciate that. Yeah. Uh, put a little station in the back where nobody
[53:18.390 --> 53:22.390]  can see what I'm doing back there. And don't bother me between bringing me plates of food
[53:22.390 --> 53:28.390]  and the office. Yeah. Just call the place, the office. It'd be hard to, uh, in the winter,
[53:28.390 --> 53:33.390]  it'd be hard for me to have a vegetarian restaurant because I'd just be so disappointed by the
[53:33.390 --> 53:41.390]  produce. We know organic vegetables would be really expensive. I wonder, uh, yeah. Yeah.
[53:41.390 --> 53:45.390]  I wonder if we could grow some vegetables. I think that's probably, uh, one of the downsides
[53:45.390 --> 53:48.390]  of the cannabis industry. Now, if you want to build a greenhouse, there's certain you're
[53:48.390 --> 53:54.390]  going to grow weed in it. So like $1 million. Yeah. That's actually, sorry. I'm sure that's
[53:54.390 --> 54:01.390]  my retirement plan is, but, um, not for full of cannabis and yeah. Yeah. Greenhouse vegetables.
[54:01.390 --> 54:08.390]  Yeah. Flowers, vegetables. Yeah. Lettuce. I feel like the music dropped out. I can feel
[54:08.390 --> 54:13.390]  it. Yeah. A long time. I totally had some, I was going to say we should talk about and
[54:13.390 --> 54:19.390]  I just forgot. Oh, have you guys ever grown any produce inside? Not inside myself. Not
[54:19.390 --> 54:25.390]  like actually like fully ran it through. Like I put it inside like to start seed and shit.
[54:25.390 --> 54:29.390]  But besides that, no, I've done go ahead. Mike. I was going to say I did the little
[54:29.390 --> 54:34.390]  like window side herbs and things like that, but nothing other than that. Yeah. I've done
[54:34.390 --> 54:40.390]  real basic stuff. Lettuce, basil, tried a tomato plant one time and it was taking up
[54:40.390 --> 54:48.390]  room. So I've grown some great shit outdoors, but never inside. Yeah. It's growing an outdoor
[54:48.390 --> 54:52.390]  vegetable crop for yourself is awesome. When you're eating a meal and you're like, I grew
[54:52.390 --> 54:56.390]  90% of the stuff in this meal right now. If I knew how to make tortillas, man, I would
[54:56.390 --> 55:03.390]  be self-reliant. I can show you. Yeah. I'm sure learning how to make a tortilla. So that's
[55:04.390 --> 55:11.390]  going to be like, he's going to make tortillas. It'll be over all the time. Guys, we've almost
[55:11.390 --> 55:14.390]  gone for an hour. I bet if I put commercials on this thing, an intro and an outro and a
[55:14.390 --> 55:18.390]  big shout out to task rock, I bet I could make this a nice even hour. You guys got anything
[55:18.390 --> 55:22.390]  fancy to say? I know I've asked that once, but we've rambled on for a few minutes since
[55:22.390 --> 55:28.390]  then. I want to give a shout out to a chick on Instagram. I think it's seven, 10 nurse
[55:28.390 --> 55:35.390]  or something like that. Oh, she replied to my, uh, the shout out for the show. Hey, what's
[55:35.390 --> 55:39.390]  up hippie nurse? Seven, 10. I know who you are. Yeah. Thanks for listening to the show.
[55:39.390 --> 55:42.390]  She's a loyal listener. I actually know that person in person and we give her a lot of
[55:42.390 --> 55:46.390]  girl advice. I didn't know she shouted you out on the show. That's cool. What's up chick?
[55:46.390 --> 55:51.390]  Let me know that, uh, she's listening. She's listening. She certainly is. It's cool as
[55:51.390 --> 55:56.390]  fuck. Yeah. She's got some outdoor stuff going on that looks pretty damn good. I mean, she
[55:56.390 --> 56:01.390]  could, it's pictures of it on fucking Facebook. It's there. It happens. I didn't just call
[56:01.390 --> 56:06.390]  her out on that. Yeah. I might give her advice on that once in a while. Uh, any shout outs
[56:06.390 --> 56:11.390]  over there, dude, you're all looking into your phone. No. Spence shout outs, plugs.
[56:11.390 --> 56:18.390]  Let's see. Um, shout out to my lady. She just turned 21. Happy birthday. You're finally
[56:19.390 --> 56:26.390]  old enough to go where we can all go now. Um, we all love you. Uh, and then shout out
[56:26.390 --> 56:33.390]  to, uh, Irish genetics, Jeff, um, Jesse, Michael, you know, anybody that's, you know, ever been
[56:33.390 --> 56:38.390]  on the show that's not here or anybody that supports the show. Yeah. Um, thank you for
[56:38.390 --> 56:43.390]  supporting the show for sure. Yeah. Thanks a lot guys. Uh, Garden. You gave me a shout
[56:43.390 --> 56:49.390]  out and I got like four new followers. This is my who's been sitting here. Um, garden
[56:49.390 --> 56:53.390]  of Weeden. Yeah. Shout out to the whole garden of Weeden crew. Even, even Fong way out there.
[56:53.390 --> 56:58.390]  Yeah. All the guys, all the guys in other States, I'm not going to call out their States,
[56:58.390 --> 57:02.390]  but even if I met you once or twice in your garden of Weeden crew, I know who you are
[57:02.390 --> 57:12.390]  still. Um, there are events in Denver on Thursday. Um, I'm not going to Thursday, bro. I know
[57:12.390 --> 57:15.390]  you're going to be on the show tonight. We're doing a podcast while they're kicking it.
[57:15.390 --> 57:19.390]  But, um, I just want to say everybody get out in the community and start enjoying, you
[57:19.390 --> 57:24.390]  know, the atmosphere of what's going on, you know, cause Colorado is a special place. Like
[57:24.390 --> 57:27.390]  other States, you can't do what we do. And you know, we've got places where we can just
[57:27.390 --> 57:32.390]  go mingle and eat and hang out. And you know, instead of getting drunk, we're taking dabs
[57:32.390 --> 57:35.390]  and smoking joints, you know what I'm saying? So if you live here, go enjoy it. If you,
[57:35.390 --> 57:39.390]  you know, if you're up to it, if not, you know, whatever. But if you're in the community,
[57:39.390 --> 57:44.390]  go enjoy. Yeah. Come out. Uh, you don't have to be a certain type of person or nobody judges
[57:44.390 --> 57:48.390]  anybody there. We're all happy people that all like to smoke pot. Come taste some amazing
[57:48.390 --> 57:52.390]  herb. Come see what your herb can be grown. Like come meet a grower, come meet a breeder.
[57:52.390 --> 57:56.390]  Yeah. If you're going to come out, just don't mess it up for everyone else. You got to learn
[57:56.390 --> 58:01.390]  how to, you know, behave yourself. Yeah. There's a word. We're too high for crazy stuff. So
[58:01.390 --> 58:06.390]  we just kind of just kick it. Yeah. But don't try to come take a gigantic dab and fall over
[58:07.390 --> 58:12.390]  and shit. Alcohol in these vans don't really seem to match it. Not that it's ever been a
[58:12.390 --> 58:16.390]  problem. Yeah. Very little alcohol consumption. It's just for the cotton mouth most of the
[58:16.390 --> 58:21.390]  time, but it's usually a fruity drink if you see it for sure. So this episode won't go
[58:21.390 --> 58:28.390]  out until the start of next month. So, uh, I'll be kind of busy for a couple of times
[58:28.390 --> 58:32.390]  here. So we're pre-recording, but look for us at events guys were easy to find. We usually
[58:32.390 --> 58:37.390]  post it up on Facebook or Instagram when we're going somewhere. Uh, go for it. Let's
[58:37.390 --> 58:41.390]  hear it. Cause I was going to say it's at Jesse grows on Instagram and Twitter. So now
[58:41.390 --> 58:46.390]  you can jump in. I'm on Twitter. Actually it's a Jesse at Jesse grows. OG. Jesse grows.
[58:46.390 --> 58:52.390]  OG had to adjust some stuff. I had to adjust. There actually was another guy. How did that
[58:52.390 --> 58:58.390]  even happen? Twitter. Don't care. Twitter. Don't care. It was Twitter. Payton on your
[58:59.390 --> 59:05.390]  shit. So it's at Jesse grows. OG check out Colorado bearded Colorado bearded dabbers
[59:05.390 --> 59:08.390]  on Instagram. That's our buddy Michael over here. We'll get him on the show more because
[59:08.390 --> 59:11.390]  he's got a lot of good shit to say. People are always better on the show after the second
[59:11.390 --> 59:17.390]  or third time for sure. Check out garden of weed and for sure. He posts a lot of great
[59:17.390 --> 59:21.390]  pictures. Also make sure you check out at I read genetics on Instagram. I post a lot
[59:21.390 --> 59:25.390]  of weed pictures. I've been posting, trying to broaden my spectrum of type of pictures.
[59:26.390 --> 59:31.390]  I post these to the camera, man. I'm telling you the camera will change your life because
[59:31.390 --> 59:35.390]  you can listen. You can take, imagine all the pictures you can take your plants, but
[59:35.390 --> 59:40.390]  then there's like dad pictures you can take. Oh yeah. Like there's all types. There's like
[59:40.390 --> 59:43.390]  if you want to get a guy that once I buy it, you're not going to see me for like a week.
[59:43.390 --> 59:47.390]  You're going to be like, where are you? Like take your pictures, bro. And you'll come over
[59:47.390 --> 59:52.390]  and get your pictures taken. Yeah. So yeah. But you may have convinced me to just drive
[59:52.390 --> 59:57.390]  to Best Buy and go pick that shit up pretty soon because I really want one too. It's on
[59:57.390 --> 01:00:01.390]  my Christmas list. It was on my wedding or you could just register for black Friday and
[01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:05.390]  you could probably catch them for a steal, but that's the first one to say that it's
[01:00:05.390 --> 01:00:10.390]  kind of far off. I don't think any disappointment like Friday. Yeah. That's the epitome of America.
[01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:17.390]  Cyber Monday sounds dirty. Hey, speaking of that, uh, I grow is a high growth supply is
[01:00:17.390 --> 01:00:23.390]  about to launch a, uh, nationwide website, uh, with the shipping department and all
[01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:28.390]  that stuff. And we'll have our, uh, actually I think the prices are going to be a little
[01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:33.390]  bit lower than they are in the store, but nationwide shipping and everyone can get great
[01:00:33.390 --> 01:00:38.390]  deals like we get here. Um, and I believe there'll be an in-store pickup program too.
[01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:43.390]  Yeah. That'll be helpful. And the, uh, the tote of soil deal is now over you guys. Oh,
[01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:47.390]  yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't buy one. Where would I, where would it, where are you going to
[01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:52.390]  put that? We sold a couple, but I never even saw one. I was wanting to see it, but I never
[01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:59.390]  got to see it. It was how many gallons is one? I think it was, uh, I said it would fill
[01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:06.390]  48, seven gallon pots. I should've got one. All right. That was the last of me a while.
[01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:11.390]  Yeah, but I don't need the, I can't, if you got the right spots, you could do it. Recycle.
[01:01:11.390 --> 01:01:19.390]  What is it? Reuse, recycle, reduce, reuse, recycle. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The tote bag. It
[01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:25.390]  came in. Uh, I really want one of those, but I'm gross and stuff in it. A huge one. No,
[01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:31.390]  that's great for recycling. Soil. I was going to say compost pile or something. Yeah. Sweet.
[01:01:31.390 --> 01:01:35.390]  All right guys, we got three minutes before it's an hour. We're going to wrap up the show.
[01:01:35.390 --> 01:01:39.390]  Hey guys, thanks for listening. Everybody out there in podcast world, we've been getting
[01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:43.390]  a thousand listens. A thousand people are going to hear all your guys's crazy voices.
[01:01:43.390 --> 01:01:47.390]  Everybody's faces just changed. Word. Michael had no idea what he was getting into when
[01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:53.390]  he came here. I just wish y'all knew how crazy I look, but you don't. We'll take some pictures.
[01:01:53.390 --> 01:01:57.390]  We'll post them up. We'll take some pictures and show everybody how crazy you are. Sometimes
[01:01:57.390 --> 01:02:01.390]  he wears a grill. He doesn't have the grill in today, but he wears the grill. White people
[01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:11.390]  get nervous. I think it's really funny. It is. We went to a wedding. Oh, maxed it out.
[01:02:11.390 --> 01:02:17.390]  I want to hear a grill story. I haven't heard one of those. Some of the normal people that
[01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:23.390]  were more normal were Spencer, Maddie and myself and slop and big Mike were walking
[01:02:23.390 --> 01:02:27.390]  through the crowd and they kind of looked and they weren't sure if we were there to
[01:02:27.390 --> 01:02:32.390]  steal everyone's purse or if we were friends of the groom. It was pretty funny. I thought
[01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:39.390]  it was pretty funny. Everyone says they're the black sheep of their family, but you proved
[01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:45.390]  it. You proved it. Big shout out to everybody that we saw at that wedding. That was awesome.
[01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:48.390]  Best wedding ever. We keep talking about it on the show because it's amazingly cool. It's
[01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:55.390]  been a month now and we're still, uh, shout out to, uh, uh, bullheaded for, uh, and despicable
[01:02:55.390 --> 01:03:02.390]  dialects and con and boogie for rocking it that night. Nice. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad you
[01:03:02.390 --> 01:03:05.390]  got to say that. Finally. I'm glad to have you back on the show to just, just for that
[01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:10.390]  30 seconds of stuff. If nothing else, I mean at this time, this has been shadowed episode

[01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:54.810]  We're hanging out with Clinton Adam. I think everybody knows Adam. He's been here a few
[01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:58.810]  times. Clint has been here a couple of times. He was a non smoker the first few times he
[01:06:58.810 --> 01:07:03.810]  was on the show. But now Clint has converted to the dark side. Clint is now a pot smoker.
[01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:08.810]  So congratulations. Welcome to the team. Hey, thanks for you guys that do not know Clint.
[01:07:08.810 --> 01:07:13.810]  He is a comedian or an aspiring comedian. He's just a silly open miker. That's right.
[01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:17.810]  He's actually been hosting the open mic at a local bar called Phil's radiator. When is
[01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:22.810]  that and how has it been going, bro? Every Tuesday, every Tuesday, every Tuesday about
[01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:28.810]  9pm and come out. It's you know, it's just a place to try out new jokes. You know, it's
[01:07:28.810 --> 01:07:34.810]  I think it's great. We've been getting mixed reviews as to who's coming down and stuff.
[01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:38.810]  But I think it's starting to blow up. It always takes a little bit to get stuff going in this
[01:07:38.810 --> 01:07:45.810]  town. Where is Phil's Phil's is a Pueblo, Colorado, C Street and Union. Yeah, Union
[01:07:45.810 --> 01:07:50.810]  and C or D whatever it is. Right. You'll find it. Go downtown. It's the spot with the nice
[01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:56.810]  outdoor patio. You guys do comedy inside or outside right now? Inside. It's just they
[01:07:56.810 --> 01:07:59.810]  got a stage and stuff. Oh, nice. What time do we need to get there to sign up if we want
[01:07:59.810 --> 01:08:04.810]  to be on the stage? If you want to come be a comedian, try to get down there by nine.
[01:08:04.810 --> 01:08:09.810]  And even then I'm not going to hold you against the coals. If you're a little late, we'll
[01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:14.810]  get you on. It's a good time. Have you performed at Phil's yet? No, no, I've not performed
[01:08:14.810 --> 01:08:18.810]  at Phil's. Not yet. I went down there last week and just saw the show and it's it's a
[01:08:18.810 --> 01:08:23.810]  cool place, man. Cool. Good beer. And Adam's got dreams of doing some standup comedy. He's
[01:08:23.810 --> 01:08:27.810]  done a couple of shows. Unfortunately, I didn't make it. But I've heard he's it's all right.
[01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:36.810]  He's shocking is what I was told. Oh, I guess that's better than shitty. Yeah, for sure.
[01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:40.810]  It starts with the same letters, though. So they may be in may have been being nice to
[01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:44.810]  you, buddy. Hey, no, I've heard what your act is. We're not going to go into it here.
[01:08:44.810 --> 01:08:49.810]  If you said that on a show that is shocking, bro. That's big balls. So if you guys want
[01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:52.810]  to hear some guy with big balls talking about funny shit, go see Adam the next time he gets
[01:08:52.810 --> 01:08:56.810]  his big balls ready to perform somewhere. Oh, boy. Yep. Now you got to go do it. Yeah,
[01:08:56.810 --> 01:09:01.810]  that's what I got to go do. Phil's radiator feels right. Tuesdays, Tuesdays, 9 p.m. I
[01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:07.810]  got all like monster truck. Awesome. Bragg Tuesday, Tuesday, Tuesday. Adam and I and
[01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:13.810]  another hot friend. Monday night. I'm so pumped. Yeah. So it'll be the night that you guys
[01:09:13.810 --> 01:09:17.810]  are listening to the show. Probably we are going to go smoke cannabis with Doug Benson.
[01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:22.810]  Yes, we will be getting Doug with high. We're not on the show, but we're going to be doing
[01:09:22.810 --> 01:09:27.810]  actually getting high with Doug. Yeah, yeah. Doug Benson fucking lit. Yes. If you guys
[01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:32.810]  are listening to this on Monday, this will come out Monday, the 15th. Doug Benson is
[01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:37.810]  at Comedy Works in Denver tonight. The last I checked, it was not sold out. Doug Benson
[01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:42.810]  is well worth your drive to Denver. Go check it out. I will be there. There will be a smoke
[01:09:42.810 --> 01:09:46.810]  session somewhere and it'll be your chance to smoke with Rasta Jeff. It'll be a good
[01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:51.810]  time if you show up and Doug Benson, who is fucking hilarious, hilarious. My favorite
[01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:55.810]  weed comedian, probably the most popular weed comedian. Oh, definitely. Yeah. I mean, you
[01:09:55.810 --> 01:10:01.810]  listen to one of his podcasts almost every weekend and then I watch the the other one
[01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.810]  just about every week. Yeah. Two different tastes. You know what I'm saying? But we still
[01:10:04.810 --> 01:10:09.810]  we're still right there. Yeah. Doug loves movies is one of my favorite podcasts. Shout
[01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.810]  out to Doug loves movies. I guess go listen to that one when the show's over. You'll love
[01:10:12.810 --> 01:10:16.810]  it. Movies and comedy. And then if you only have a few minutes for a podcast, Doug loves
[01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:21.810]  minis is great. It's a perfect short little show. I listen to it when I take a shower.
[01:10:21.810 --> 01:10:25.810]  It does about 15 minute episodes. It's long enough to throw hit play, jump in the shower,
[01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:29.810]  clean your ass, get out and dry off and get dressed. You got about 15 minutes for a guy.
[01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:33.810]  Perfect. Yeah. So. All right. So, Doug, we've promoted you. We need you to start promoting
[01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:37.810]  us. I was going to say, I just we just went on for like a minute about Doug Benson. We're
[01:10:37.810 --> 01:10:43.810]  just pumped. Top of the episode. We've been going to Comedy Works quite a bit. And man,
[01:10:43.810 --> 01:10:47.810]  there is nothing like a good show at a good comedy club. Comedy Works has it freaking
[01:10:47.810 --> 01:10:51.810]  correct. You went to we bragged on the show about seeing Joe Rogan. Clint went the night
[01:10:51.810 --> 01:10:56.810]  before us and sat front freaking road. Really? I don't know how that happened. They let your
[01:10:56.810 --> 01:11:00.810]  hairy ass up there. It was they weren't filming that night. Oh, yeah. They just let us up
[01:11:00.810 --> 01:11:05.810]  there. Of course, they wouldn't let my ugly ass up there. When they were filming, they
[01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:10.810]  would put decent looking people up front. But then a sexy young lady and a guy showed
[01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:14.810]  up and they had no problem telling those people, sorry, you have to move and they would reseach
[01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:19.810]  you. And then this girl in like a tangerine or melon colored shirt with giant boobs and
[01:11:19.810 --> 01:11:23.810]  a lot of makeup. And you could tell she was going to go out front row and they just walked
[01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:27.810]  her right up to the front row and put her in the front like they had no problem making
[01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:32.810]  people move. Dan Rainey and Matt Chapman were at the show and they kind of got put
[01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:38.810]  up towards the front. But then they slowly moved them back to the got moved five times.
[01:11:38.810 --> 01:11:43.810]  Jesus, I said they sat me down. We got to in line kind of early, like maybe 30 minutes
[01:11:43.810 --> 01:11:48.810]  before the doors were supposed to open. So we were in line pretty early and that's they
[01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:53.810]  just let us in. And then the group ahead of us was like of six dudes. And there's only
[01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:58.810]  seven front row seats. So like they already had most of that. So they're like, all right,
[01:11:58.810 --> 01:12:02.810]  you guys go to the back. And I don't know if it's like an ideology of like, they're
[01:12:02.810 --> 01:12:05.810]  going to want to talk more because there's six of them. Yeah. You know, I'm going to
[01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:10.810]  be talking louder. There's only two me and my buddy Riley. We go up and we thought, oh,
[01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:14.810]  second row, that'll be cool. And the guy goes, Hey, there's two more front. You guys want
[01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:19.810]  front. I go, yeah, I think I do. Yeah. Yeah. And then that's a cool place to be front row.
[01:12:20.810 --> 01:12:25.810]  I'm really hoping we get there good on Monday. Joe Rogan does a beard joke. And it felt like
[01:12:25.810 --> 01:12:31.810]  it was directed at me. I know. Did you guys get that joke too? I don't know. I don't remember
[01:12:31.810 --> 01:12:35.810]  the joke. I did not get a beard joke. He did a grateful dead joke. And I felt as if you
[01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:39.810]  were staring me directly in my eyes telling this grateful dead joke. And I didn't say
[01:12:39.810 --> 01:12:43.810]  that to anybody. But on the ride home, the girl I took with me said he looked you straight
[01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:47.810]  in the face when he said the grateful dead joke. Yeah, he was talking about duck dynasty
[01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:53.810]  beards. Oh, he might've. Yeah. He did mention duck dynasty. Yeah. Yeah. But that, yeah.
[01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:57.810]  Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I mimed a part of his joke cause I really don't want to give it away.
[01:12:57.810 --> 01:13:02.810]  Don't want to be on comedies central here. Not that long. We got to go to that show.
[01:13:02.810 --> 01:13:06.810]  Yeah. That was fucking great. Him and I were in the taping dude. See, and I didn't want
[01:13:06.810 --> 01:13:11.810]  to be in the taping. Honestly, I would rather not next time. Yeah. It was stressful. Uh,
[01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:14.810]  you couldn't go take a piss and I didn't have to piss, but just telling me that I can't
[01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:18.810]  go take a piss. Now I have to piss. It's like, you're just like, Oh, I can't. Well
[01:13:18.810 --> 01:13:21.810]  suddenly I need to pee. Yeah. Now I'm going to be sitting here. I had to pee the whole
[01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:25.810]  time he was on, but I was like, I'm not leaving. No food or drink service during the entire
[01:13:25.810 --> 01:13:29.810]  show. They came and took our beverages, everything, everything. You know, the comedy works, they
[01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:33.810]  have a menu hanging from the chair in front of you. They took that, they took the pen.
[01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:38.810]  Uh, they made everybody take off their hats. Yeah. It was a little, no logos. Like I said,
[01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:42.810]  they were moving ugly people to the back of the room. Like it was definitely intense.
[01:13:42.810 --> 01:13:47.810]  Back row. They sat me under a camera. Like the camera was right above my head. That's
[01:13:47.810 --> 01:13:50.810]  why, that's why I feel like a couple of the jokes, Joe was looking me in his eyes telling
[01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:54.810]  them to me because it gave him right there. Yeah. The camera was above my head and they
[01:13:54.810 --> 01:13:57.810]  made it feel instead of talk to that machine, he could just talk to me and it felt a little
[01:13:57.810 --> 01:14:02.810]  more natural because I was high and laughing my ass off. Yeah. Yeah. Seeing, I was just
[01:14:02.810 --> 01:14:07.810]  laughing. It was a good time. I'm sure we've heard is a fun place, man. Like it's just,
[01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:11.810]  yeah, we went for a walk after and I was fun having, I had a lady friend with me and I
[01:14:11.810 --> 01:14:14.810]  had Adam with me and it was fun because a dude walked up and recognized me is like,
[01:14:14.810 --> 01:14:18.810]  Hey man, are you that guy? I was like, I am Rasta Jeff from Irie genetics and we talked
[01:14:18.810 --> 01:14:22.810]  about seeds and stuff. Did he ever get ahold of you? And you know, I don't think so. Okay.
[01:14:22.810 --> 01:14:25.810]  Well, if you're listening out there, brother, Phil was his name. So what's up, Phil? If
[01:14:25.810 --> 01:14:29.810]  you haven't contacted me yet, uh, hit me up on Facebook, send me a direct message. I'm
[01:14:29.810 --> 01:14:32.810]  taking flyers with me to Denver Monday. I don't care what you say. Okay. All right.
[01:14:32.810 --> 01:14:35.810]  We've only got a couple of few left. We may need to go to Kinko's and get some printed.
[01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:39.810]  All right. All right. We got five. We need to give Tony Hinchcliffe a big shout out.
[01:14:39.810 --> 01:14:42.810]  I don't know if we talked about Tony Hinchcliffe on the podcast. We've talked about the Joe
[01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:46.810]  Rogan show, but Clint got to go to, so I'm re excited. Yeah. Uh, Tony Hinchcliffe nailed
[01:14:46.810 --> 01:14:50.810]  it, dude. That is one hell of a comedian. It was really, but you could still see, yes,
[01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:56.810]  he's been doing comedy for a while. Oh yeah. But you could see, uh, another step when you
[01:14:56.810 --> 01:15:00.810]  watch Joe Rogan, not to say that Tony Hinchcliffe wasn't great because that's, that's what I
[01:15:00.810 --> 01:15:04.810]  like seeing. I like seeing guys that are better than me cause I can go, Oh, I'm not the big
[01:15:04.810 --> 01:15:10.810]  fish in the little pond. I'm a little fish in a little pond. Quit being a like get better.
[01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:13.810]  But that's what I get to see. Like when we bring guys down and they're, they've been
[01:15:13.810 --> 01:15:17.810]  doing it for like five years, eight years, 10 years, you get to see like, Oh, that's
[01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:22.810]  where I want to be. Right. But it was, but seeing Tony Hinchcliffe and I don't know how
[01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:26.810]  long he's been telling jokes. I know he's 30. He said, yeah. Um, you listened to the
[01:15:26.810 --> 01:15:32.810]  Joe Rogan experience. Well, yeah, that, but he also said it when he was talking about
[01:15:32.810 --> 01:15:39.810]  being, did he do his a knit cap bit? Yeah. He was like, I'm a 30 year old man and then
[01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:43.810]  it kept leaking and it can't. So, yeah, but you're right. Yeah. I listened to him on Tony
[01:15:43.810 --> 01:15:53.810]  or on Joe Rogan. Um, but it was, it was a magical dude. I don't know. I just put my
[01:15:54.810 --> 01:16:02.810]  shit in the microphone to do that. It was weird. I'm sorry. Um, no, uh, but Tony Hinchcliffe
[01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:08.810]  was on par. Yeah, definitely. He's got some really good jokes, but, and I mean, not only
[01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:14.810]  that, but you say Joe Rogan killed it. I mean, as a comic to be up there for an hour, Jesus,
[01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:20.810]  you know, and I mean him talked about it afterwards. You know, he was really nervous. You could
[01:16:20.810 --> 01:16:24.810]  see the nerves at the first five minutes. I thought so. And a lady heckled him. I heard
[01:16:24.810 --> 01:16:29.810]  about that. You told me about that. As soon as she heckled him, he came out of the like
[01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:32.810]  nervous thing, went away and he's like, what bitch? And he kind of went off on her for
[01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:36.810]  a minute. And when he came back to the set, he was on point from then on. I think that
[01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:41.810]  heckler kind of helped him out, kind of helped him. And it brought the crowd and him together
[01:16:41.810 --> 01:16:46.810]  before, before that there was a barrier between the performer and the crowd because it was
[01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:51.810]  called cameras. Yeah. Yeah. That tension in there affected our laughter and his performance.
[01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:57.810]  But once that heckler, all of that, we became one. Yeah. That's a, does Tony Hinchcliffe
[01:16:57.810 --> 01:17:01.810]  and you guys can laugh your asses off if you want. Is Tony Hinchcliffe slightly remind
[01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:07.810]  you of Inaya Lujan? He's got the look, the really mellow calmness. You can't shake him
[01:17:07.810 --> 01:17:12.810]  nerves of steel. Just kind of feels like his, you know, he's kind of always up here. Yeah.
[01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:18.810]  Yeah. And slightly a hipster. I don't, I don't know what I, I, I looked at him and I, I didn't
[01:17:18.810 --> 01:17:24.810]  think that he felt like, like he was having fun. He just like his sense of humor is so
[01:17:24.810 --> 01:17:28.810]  like, yeah, that's kind of like this. And so it just, it wasn't, I wish he'd have been
[01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:33.810]  having more fun while he was telling his jokes. They did invite him back for a weekend. So
[01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:36.810]  we got to pay attention to when Tony Hinchcliffe has come to go to that. Yeah. I'd love to
[01:17:36.810 --> 01:17:41.810]  see, I'd love to see more than how much he probably did. 20 did about 15 when we saw
[01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:46.810]  that. Yeah. So, so I'll just talk to comedy. I guess I'm going to keep going. Sunday night.
[01:17:46.810 --> 01:17:52.810]  I went to the oddball comedy fest, the oddball comedy tour with Hardwick. That was amazing.
[01:17:52.810 --> 01:17:56.810]  Was he like headlining it? Was he, no, he was actually second Louis CK headlined. There
[01:17:56.810 --> 01:18:01.810]  were nine comedians. I think there were Brody Stevens was the host and he said nine comedians
[01:18:01.810 --> 01:18:04.810]  and he must've been one of the performers that he counted. Cause I can't think of who
[01:18:04.810 --> 01:18:09.810]  the other, the others were. It was a Brody Stevens, Whitney Cummings, Chris Hardwick,
[01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:17.810]  Demetri Martin, Hannibal Buress, Sarah Silverman. I'm going to forget somebody cause I'm on
[01:18:17.810 --> 01:18:24.810]  the spot. Mark Marin, uh, say Louie already somebody. And then Louis CK who was before
[01:18:24.810 --> 01:18:30.810]  John Rivers. It might've been Joe. That set was quite stale. I'm going to Google it because
[01:18:30.810 --> 01:18:38.810]  I feel bad missing somebody on that list. Where's that losing prices. Right. I'm looking
[01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:44.810]  for it. I really want to get it right. Cause I feel bad. Um, but it was, I mean, Red Rocks
[01:18:44.810 --> 01:18:47.810]  seems like I haven't been down there yet, but it definitely, I saw the picture. Oh,
[01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:55.810]  Aziz Ansari is who I'm forgetting. How did you forget Aziz? Whoa. So little. Aziz was
[01:18:55.810 --> 01:19:01.810]  great. Uh, I think everybody got 15 minutes, but I think Louie may have gotten, it seemed
[01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:05.810]  like Louie did 30 minutes. And if you're a comedy fan, uh, we've gone on for a minute,
[01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:11.810]  but you'll get this part. Every single second of Louie set was calculated. He knew where
[01:19:11.810 --> 01:19:16.810]  to, where to breathe. He knew where to take a couple of steps. I don't think, and I'm
[01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:20.810]  not a comedian, but I, I paid enough attention to you guys. I'm friends with all you comedian
[01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:25.810]  guys. And I've paid enough attention to what you say. And so I get it now and I could feel
[01:19:25.810 --> 01:19:29.810]  every minute of him. He crushed it. Dude. Always be crushing was Louie's motto that
[01:19:30.810 --> 01:19:35.810]  he was killing it, dude on it. I need to see him now. Yeah. Now just, just to see his mannerisms,
[01:19:35.810 --> 01:19:40.810]  but you've performed, you know, so it's, it's also performance. You understand like when
[01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:46.810]  the singer does it in this note, it sounds a lot better than this note. That's like one
[01:19:46.810 --> 01:19:51.810]  octave higher or whatever. The drummer. My thing is to play less. If I overplay as a
[01:19:51.810 --> 01:19:55.810]  drummer, then you sound like you're insecure. When you learn to get older and play less
[01:19:55.810 --> 01:20:00.810]  notes, it's when you sound better. And I think Louie has learned each note perfectly.
[01:20:00.810 --> 01:20:04.810]  Louie, I, and honestly not to sound like an asshole. He was one of the comedians I was
[01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:08.810]  not most excited to see. Yeah. Haven't you seen him before? No, I've never seen Louis
[01:20:08.810 --> 01:20:11.810]  CK perform before. I've never seen any of those guys perform live before it was. So
[01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:17.810]  I got to see nine of the world's best. Uh, Aziz was good, really high energy, uh, stuck
[01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:22.810]  to the same joke basically the whole time. Told like a story with a lot of taglines and
[01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:28.810]  a lot of callbacks. So that was cool. Hardwick, I was being, this affects my podcast hosting.
[01:20:28.810 --> 01:20:33.810]  Uh, I listened to Nerdist often. Uh, I watch at midnight. Uh, I've followed Hardwick since
[01:20:33.810 --> 01:20:38.810]  the freaking, uh, singled out days. So I know he's from Denver. I know how he used to play
[01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:43.810]  in a band with Furman called my hardened firm. So they come out, he comes out at Red Rocks
[01:20:43.810 --> 01:20:47.810]  and he puts his hands up in the air in there and he's like red rocks. And I could see the
[01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:52.810]  15 year old boy in him that's wanted to do that since the first time he touched a guitar.
[01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:56.810]  I was like, that was his dream. Just he's, he just clumbed his pants. I could see it.
[01:20:56.810 --> 01:21:00.810]  That's fucking awesome. Yeah. And I kind of got to share that with my friend, Chris Hardwick
[01:21:00.810 --> 01:21:04.810]  through podcasting and that relationship that I feel that stalker relationship that you
[01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:09.810]  feel like you have with all the celebrities. I did feel like that with Joe Rogan. Like
[01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:15.810]  I felt like this is my buddy performing and I've known him. And then I wanted to like,
[01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:18.810]  as he was walking off the stage, I wanted to shake his hand and stuff. But I was just
[01:21:18.810 --> 01:21:24.810]  like, also like, he's not a guy, you know? And that's a weird thing to like have this
[01:21:24.810 --> 01:21:28.810]  relationship with people that like is a one sided relationship. Yeah. But I could see
[01:21:28.810 --> 01:21:33.810]  that. Like I would probably do the same thing with Hardwick. It's just be like, I felt pride
[01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:37.810]  for him. One of my buddies just crushed it at red rocks. Cause he was awesome. He did
[01:21:37.810 --> 01:21:43.810]  a great, great set. His set was, uh, man, he's kind of a pervert dude. He did, uh, he
[01:21:43.810 --> 01:21:46.810]  did a joke and I don't want to blow his bit, but half of his bit was about fucking your
[01:21:46.810 --> 01:21:51.810]  mom. That's funny. Like, yeah. Yeah. And for Hardwick to go that route at red rocks was,
[01:21:51.810 --> 01:21:54.810]  it was funny for me. That's pretty great. Uh, Dimitri Martin did his thing. Dimitri
[01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:59.810]  Martin. He surprised me how funny he was. My date that I took with me, she loved him.
[01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:04.810]  That's who she went to see. So that was good. We got to chuckle at that. Uh, DJ trauma is
[01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:08.810]  a killer DJ, by the way, he's the one that ran music, uh, between the comedians. And
[01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:12.810]  then we took a 15 minute intermission. It was about a 30 minute intermission. I believe
[01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:16.810]  if you do comedy for too long, you burn out. You're funny. Oh yeah. So they gave a nice
[01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:20.810]  intermission and we stood up and danced for a few. Uh, Hannibal were, Burest was great.
[01:22:20.810 --> 01:22:24.810]  He did his thing. Uh, he made a joke about Colorado having the ugliest crowd. And then
[01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:29.810]  he said, it looks like y'all came from a hike. And then he thought about it. He goes, you
[01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:32.810]  probably all just did. And then he made a joke about who was the white guy that broke
[01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:36.810]  down out here and decided let's build a venue. We can do shows here because red rocks is
[01:22:36.810 --> 01:22:41.810]  kind of in the middle of nowhere. Yeah. Uh, Louis CK crush. Like I said, Mark Marin was
[01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:45.810]  good. His closer was solid, but you could tell he was frazzled and didn't know what
[01:22:45.810 --> 01:22:51.810]  to do with 15 minutes. Um, Marin's used to 45 to whittle Marin down to 15 minutes is
[01:22:51.810 --> 01:22:55.810]  kind of like, you got to give him time to get out on the stage and sit down at the edge
[01:22:55.810 --> 01:22:59.810]  of the stage and get pissed off about something. And then he gets into that Mark Marin thing.
[01:22:59.810 --> 01:23:04.810]  He didn't get time for that in his 15. I didn't feel he was good. His closer was hilarious.
[01:23:04.810 --> 01:23:08.810]  Like I won't blow anybody's been on purpose, but his closer was great. Sarah Silverman
[01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:14.810]  surprised the shit out of me. Uh, her set was great, but she is funny. Like she is
[01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:20.810]  naturally funny. You could just tell Whitney Cummings fucking yells her set at you. Like
[01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:26.810]  I'm Whitney and my jokes are funny. So you're going to laugh punchline like, and it's what
[01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:29.810]  it feels like the whole time. It feels like you're being barraged with jokes. She was
[01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:34.810]  funny, but it was a bit fucking too much for me. It just saying the way she delivered them
[01:23:34.810 --> 01:23:39.810]  could have been better. She forgot she had a microphone and she had to yell. She was,
[01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:43.810]  she was Roman style. Like, and I felt that way about her TV shows. Like when she's on
[01:23:43.810 --> 01:23:47.810]  TV, she doesn't feel like she's speaking. She feels like she's over projecting to me
[01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:52.810]  too much. Uh, and then Brody Stevens needs medication. Brody Stevens was the host. Uh,
[01:23:52.810 --> 01:23:56.810]  Brody, take your medicine, buddy. I love you. I respect you. Dude, you need to calm down.
[01:23:56.810 --> 01:24:01.810]  Brody Stevens fucking harness that shit, bro. Like, I don't know, man, maybe you smoke too
[01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:04.810]  much of that good Colorado weed, but at that show you were fucking losing your fucking
[01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:09.810]  shit. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not a huge fan of Brody Stevens. Yeah. I just not my thing,
[01:24:09.810 --> 01:24:14.810]  but personal preference there. Well, it's just like anything. Like I'm, I'm so glad
[01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.810]  that there's some people that don't like my comedy because if everybody liked it, it'd
[01:24:18.810 --> 01:24:23.810]  be like, wow, that was, that was, that's not right. Everybody's as fucked up as me. That
[01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:27.810]  doesn't make any sense. Nobody wants another Dane cook. I keep telling my mom that she
[01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:31.810]  doesn't want to hear it, but she doesn't fucking listen to me. So your mom's going to come
[01:24:31.810 --> 01:24:35.810]  see your comedy. She wants to, that's going to be funny. It's going to be hilarious. I
[01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:39.810]  want to tape it. I'm not going to have the camera pointed at you at all. It'll be her
[01:24:39.810 --> 01:24:45.810]  reaction the entire time. I haven't, I got, I make sure that nobody's coming to my shows
[01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:51.810]  like family wise. Like they don't know when I do stuff that they do now. They do now.
[01:24:51.810 --> 01:24:55.810]  Yeah. Cause I listened to the, I grow culture podcast. Tuesday nights, nine o'clock Phil's
[01:24:55.810 --> 01:25:00.810]  radio, downtown Pueblo, Colorado. It's free to get in, right? It's free to get in. Hey,
[01:25:00.810 --> 01:25:07.810]  it's free. Any smoking weed. What? He's grounded. Grounded. You're done. Speaking of smoking
[01:25:07.810 --> 01:25:11.810]  weed, this is a podcast about consuming cannabis, growing cannabis and cannabis education. We
[01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:15.810]  should probably talk a little bit about cannabis. Got a little ranty. Especially, but I think
[01:25:15.810 --> 01:25:18.810]  our listeners enjoy getting a little inside of our heads and a little bit of our world
[01:25:18.810 --> 01:25:22.810]  and knowing what's up with us. I like, like I said, that Chris Hardwick talk, uh, they're
[01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:26.810]  my friends now. They know what I'm doing. They're 29, 30 episodes into being my buddy.
[01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:31.810]  We've spent 30 hours together now. Absolutely. We're bros and sis's I guess. What do you
[01:25:31.810 --> 01:25:34.810]  call it? We're not, if you're a lady out there, you're my bro. I don't know what else to call
[01:25:34.810 --> 01:25:37.810]  you right now. You're family. You're awesome. Thanks for listening to the show. Just as
[01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:42.810]  much as all the dudes. I have a female friend who was encouraging me to do an all episode,
[01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:47.810]  an episode all about women and cannabis. I don't know what to do. I told her to research
[01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:50.810]  it for me and help me out. If you guys have any ideas for women in cannabis, it feels
[01:25:50.810 --> 01:25:54.810]  sexist. A guy doing a show all about women in cannabis. So anything I come up with, I
[01:25:54.810 --> 01:25:58.810]  feel like it'll be gender biased and it'll be weird. So ladies send me some stuff so
[01:25:58.810 --> 01:26:03.810]  that I can do a ladies podcast. I'll, I want to satisfy the listeners. And if you're asking
[01:26:03.810 --> 01:26:09.810]  for it, that's what we gots to do. I'm ranting again. So women and cannabis. Yeah. That's
[01:26:09.810 --> 01:26:13.810]  just the tremors, right? Oh man. So Clint is a comedian. We should remind you. And these
[01:26:14.810 --> 01:26:19.810]  are jokes. That one wasn't. I wasn't even going to open my mouth. What are you going
[01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:24.810]  to do? I'm actually going to give a shout out to miss green thumb, Jessica here, a bad
[01:26:24.810 --> 01:26:28.810]  ass grower. I'll stand up for you. One of my favorite female growers. I was going to
[01:26:28.810 --> 01:26:33.810]  say, do you not know any kind of people from Denver that maybe could travel down and you
[01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:38.810]  know, well, yeah, we can get people on the show. Yeah, definitely. But we're going to
[01:26:38.810 --> 01:26:41.810]  do like an hour and it's easier for, yeah, we'll do a report on it instead of bringing
[01:26:41.810 --> 01:26:45.810]  them, but I'll talk to Jess and get some info from her because she's a bad-ass, bad-ass
[01:26:45.810 --> 01:26:50.810]  female grower. She grows as good, if not better than myself. I'll give her that credit. She
[01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:53.810]  grew some Kong. That was amazing. Follow at miss green thumb on Instagram. I'll find out
[01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:57.810]  the proper, uh, the exact Instagram address and I'll tweet that shit out so you guys can
[01:26:57.810 --> 01:27:01.810]  follow her. She's a great grower. So Clint came, I had Clint here. Clint is a, he used
[01:27:01.810 --> 01:27:05.810]  to be a non-smoker. Now he is a new smoker. It's funny because he took two puffs off of
[01:27:05.810 --> 01:27:10.810]  a bowl earlier, what dirt weed, and obviously did not come from here. I brought it in myself.
[01:27:10.810 --> 01:27:15.810]  I felt bad about it immediately, but, uh, I saw him get plenty high off two good puffs
[01:27:15.810 --> 01:27:19.810]  of some, some schwaggle weed. It wasn't really schwaggles, but it was not the day. It wasn't
[01:27:19.810 --> 01:27:25.810]  that bad. You smoked it. I mean, it's not, it's not Rasta weed. It's not Irie. It looks
[01:27:25.810 --> 01:27:28.810]  similar to that stuff that was in that bag over here the other day. He's on the smoke
[01:27:28.810 --> 01:27:33.810]  team now. So, you know, he's joining us and now he's got some questions. I do. One of
[01:27:33.810 --> 01:27:36.810]  his main, I wrote down the questions because we got blazed and I didn't want to forget
[01:27:37.810 --> 01:27:41.810]  him. He knew he looked into my eyes and he goes, Clint's not going to remember anything.
[01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:46.810]  Yeah. So one of the questions Clint had was storage. I do. Cause I don't know. You know,
[01:27:46.810 --> 01:27:54.810]  I, I, my little bag of weed is my plastic fucking up my weed. Well, I hate to dish your
[01:27:54.810 --> 01:27:57.810]  weed that you got now, but that's fine to keep in a sandwich baggie. But when you upgrade
[01:27:57.810 --> 01:28:01.810]  and you get some quality weed from somebody that's a good caregiver that likes you and
[01:28:01.810 --> 01:28:05.810]  doesn't want to see you smoking that shit anymore, uh, keep your little to go portion
[01:28:05.810 --> 01:28:10.810]  in a baggie maybe, but keep the rest of it in a jar. Uh, I store usually, you know, most
[01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:13.810]  people have like a quarter to an ounce of weed, maybe an eighth of weed. I keep it in
[01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:17.810]  a glass jar. The glass jar size can depend on the size of your stash. I use baby food.
[01:28:17.810 --> 01:28:21.810]  I was just going to say Adam uses a baby food jar to keep his weed in. 98 cents. Because
[01:28:21.810 --> 01:28:25.810]  if you go to Walmart trying to buy a jar for number one, we live in Colorado and there's
[01:28:25.810 --> 01:28:32.810]  no jars for number two, they're $6 for a jar. That's the same size and the same price, you
[01:28:32.810 --> 01:28:38.810]  know? And you get baby food. Yum. You know, Hey, I like peas and carrots, carrots and
[01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:43.810]  peas, peas and carrots. All right. So butchered weed in a jar. Uh, hopefully when you get
[01:28:43.810 --> 01:28:48.810]  it, it's not too dry. It's not too wet. Hopefully it's at the right point. Uh, if when I dry
[01:28:48.810 --> 01:28:52.810]  and cure my own weed guys, you keep asking for a drying and curing episode that's coming.
[01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:55.810]  Jesse and I are putting that together. We're putting a lot of thought and work into it.
[01:28:55.810 --> 01:28:58.810]  That should be episode 30 is the drying and curing episode. So be patient. That's coming.
[01:28:58.810 --> 01:29:03.810]  You got about a week until that's out. Yeah. Chill out. God. Yeah. Wait your turn. I'm
[01:29:03.810 --> 01:29:06.810]  just kidding. Thanks for listening and being patient. If you are listening to this next
[01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:12.810]  week, I got a big show coming up, uh, September 22nd at Phil's radiator. We're bringing a
[01:29:12.810 --> 01:29:16.810]  Ron Babcock through and he's a professional comedian who's been on TV before. Like he's
[01:29:16.810 --> 01:29:21.810]  been on HBO. He's been on comedy central. Does he do weed jokes? I don't think so. He
[01:29:21.810 --> 01:29:26.810]  has to. Yeah. Well, he's from LA at least he's he's coming from LA. He's going to hit
[01:29:26.810 --> 01:29:33.810]  Phil's radiator Monday. It's only $5. Like it's yeah, it's the 22nd. It's a good, he's
[01:29:33.810 --> 01:29:37.810]  and he's going to do as long as he wants to do. I'm going to do maybe 10 minutes. Paul's
[01:29:37.810 --> 01:29:41.810]  going to do 10 minutes. Paul Rosales is really funny. Paul Garrett Waller is going to be
[01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:46.810]  on that. What's up you giant fucker. Huge, huge jokes. He might guy. Yeah. He might do
[01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:52.810]  a fat guy joke. He might, he might not. He will. Um, and then, uh, John Bueno's on that
[01:29:52.810 --> 01:29:56.810]  as well. Oh, John Bueno. I hope he wears a fancy sweater. Yeah. Yeah. He probably,
[01:29:56.810 --> 01:30:01.810]  he looks so good. He was rocking mr. Rogers last week. He's a fucking killer. I just derailed
[01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:05.810]  to plug without asking at all. It's cool. I caught you doing it. And I like, I like
[01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:09.810]  the natural flow of this show. That's what we expect out of Clint. Just ruin the show.
[01:30:09.810 --> 01:30:14.810]  That's what we expect out of Clint. I know where we are. Cause I took notes and we let
[01:30:14.810 --> 01:30:17.810]  you get nice and high. So you're not going to ruin anything. I'm the captain of this
[01:30:17.810 --> 01:30:22.810]  ship. I'm going to start something called the, uh, what, what, what I'm going to start
[01:30:22.810 --> 01:30:27.810]  something called the, uh, the, the cuss jar here pretty soon. Every time I say after starting
[01:30:27.810 --> 01:30:31.810]  on episode 30, every time I say the word fuck, I will donate a dollar to a charity. Uh, I
[01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:36.810]  had a conversation with the guy on Instagram today and he asked me to donate to a charity
[01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:40.810]  and I will find out the charity that he was asking about. And I'll donate a dollar starting
[01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:46.810]  on episode 30. Every time I say fuck in a podcast, how about each episode? However many
[01:30:46.810 --> 01:30:50.810]  times you say fuck, you have to donate to a different charity. That way you're spreading
[01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:54.810]  it around. Maybe. Well, hopefully I don't say fuck more than like six or seven times
[01:30:54.810 --> 01:30:57.810]  before I start to hurt my feelings because after I start, I'm going to throw down the
[01:30:57.810 --> 01:31:01.810]  dollars on the table and watch them happen. So it's going to get expensive. Last one.
[01:31:01.810 --> 01:31:04.810]  You only had two, I believe. Yeah. So hopefully I can get to zero and hopefully this guy's
[01:31:04.810 --> 01:31:10.810]  charity doesn't get anything out of me. But yeah, I don't care what your charity is. No,
[01:31:10.810 --> 01:31:14.810]  I, we had a good conversation. I made a new friend today on Instagram. He started off
[01:31:14.810 --> 01:31:17.810]  mad at me by something that I posted and I turned him right around once I explained
[01:31:17.810 --> 01:31:21.810]  what I meant and made a friend with the guy. So shout out Dr. Green thumbs. It's not, there
[01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:24.810]  are so many Dr. Green thumbs on Instagram that you won't be able to find which one.
[01:31:24.810 --> 01:31:30.810]  Now it's a shout out to Instagram. But that dude, I'm going to donate to his charity if
[01:31:30.810 --> 01:31:35.810]  I say fuck on episode 30. So anytime after this episode, the F word cost me a dollar.
[01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:40.810]  I'll start to, once I keep screwing up, I will increase my, my value for the F word.
[01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:44.810]  Oh, and we're also not going to keep track. So you have to tell us. Yeah. People, you
[01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:48.810]  know, people tweet me. I actually, no, that's fine. Just, we're not going to keep track.
[01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:52.810]  So dreadful Jay has been tweeting me. Somebody else has tweeted me. So they remind me. I
[01:31:52.810 --> 01:31:55.810]  said this on the show before. Making like a compilation of you saying fuck over and
[01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:59.810]  over. So we've just said fuck like 14 times in the past five minutes. So me and Clint
[01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:02.810]  are allowed. You're not. Yeah. I don't remember putting up any money. Huh? Maybe I'll make
[01:32:02.810 --> 01:32:06.810]  that a guest stipulation too. So you guys got to throw. Maybe we'll all start matching
[01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:12.810]  it. Then we all got to match it. No, I'm below poverty. Right. You know, I would just be
[01:32:12.810 --> 01:32:17.810]  doing it just to be a dick. Clint works at a steel mill. So fuck is in his daily vocabulary
[01:32:17.810 --> 01:32:22.810]  and Adam is from the South and you know, he knows like six words and two of them are fuck.
[01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:29.810]  Yeah. And the other one is, yeah. Yeah. Shut up. We're talking about storage. So you're
[01:32:29.810 --> 01:32:35.810]  saying baby food. Yeah. Baby food. Although that's just what I use. I mean, I literally
[01:32:35.810 --> 01:32:39.810]  got tired of going to Walmart and there being none, you know, after you drive to both Walmarts
[01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:43.810]  on either side of town and you're like, do I really want to go out to West? No, I just
[01:32:43.810 --> 01:32:49.810]  98 cents. You know, you scoop it out, you clean it out, leave it, let it dry. And then
[01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:53.810]  yeah, it's, it's good in there. And that's, that's perfect for an eighth, you know, especially
[01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:56.810]  like a fluffy eighth. Yes. That's what you got to wait until you got to make sure your
[01:32:56.810 --> 01:32:59.810]  weeds are dry enough to go into a jar. I was about to say, I like that's where I derailed
[01:32:59.810 --> 01:33:03.810]  you. I know I'm, I'm on it, bro. I'm getting good at this podcast thing. When my weed,
[01:33:03.810 --> 01:33:06.810]  when I'm curing and drying my weed, I'll leave it a little bit extra moist for my personal
[01:33:06.810 --> 01:33:10.810]  so that I almost have to open. Yes, I do smoke flowers. Still. People don't believe that
[01:33:10.810 --> 01:33:13.810]  I still smoke weed. I do. It's not always dabs, but I'll leave my weed a little moist
[01:33:13.810 --> 01:33:17.810]  where I got to open the jar and take the buds out and set them down for 10 or 20 minutes
[01:33:17.810 --> 01:33:21.810]  before I can actually roll a joint with it. And that's just my personal, if it's a production
[01:33:21.810 --> 01:33:24.810]  crop for my patients, I'm a caregiver and the herb that's going to get delivered to
[01:33:24.810 --> 01:33:29.810]  a guy later on tonight, that stuff's dry. It's been cured and it's dry. It's ready to
[01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:32.810]  go into his jar. He'll keep, he's getting a half, so it's probably going to go in a
[01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:36.810]  Mason jar. It'll be sealed up and he'll just, he'll probably pull out a little baby food
[01:33:36.810 --> 01:33:40.810]  jar worth for himself every couple of days when he needs it. And he hides the Mason jar
[01:33:40.810 --> 01:33:44.810]  away from the family and has that in a safe place and keeps his jar in his pocket. And
[01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:50.810]  that will also, if your weed is really dry, that may bring back some of the moisture in
[01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:53.810]  the Christmas. Good topic. If your weed's really dry, I see a lot of people trying to
[01:33:53.810 --> 01:33:58.810]  put fruit and shit in there. Don't do that. You're going to bring pathogens and molds.
[01:33:58.810 --> 01:34:01.810]  It doesn't take a lot of moisture to start molding up a jar if you leave it in there
[01:34:01.810 --> 01:34:06.810]  long enough. This company does not pay me shit, but I do highly recommend a Boveda or
[01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:11.810]  a Boveda Humidipak. It's a great product. If your weed's a little bit too dry or a little
[01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:17.810]  too moist, even you put the proper Boveda Humidipak in with your herbs and it will properly
[01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:20.810]  moisten your herb to the moisture content that is desired.
[01:34:20.810 --> 01:34:23.810]  Is it at like 67 or whatever?
[01:34:23.810 --> 01:34:24.810]  I don't remember exactly.
[01:34:24.810 --> 01:34:25.810]  It's one of those numbers.
[01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:28.810]  I'll go to the Boveda website right now.
[01:34:28.810 --> 01:34:30.810]  It's one of those numbers. I've seen it around.
[01:34:30.810 --> 01:34:31.810]  It's how much?
[01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:37.810]  It's the humidity, the perfect humidity should be around 67 or 76. It's somewhere in between
[01:34:37.810 --> 01:34:38.810]  there.
[01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:39.810]  I got you.
[01:34:39.810 --> 01:34:40.810]  It's like the same thing as a humidor.
[01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:45.810]  And then there's also, yeah, well, exactly. There are humidors for marijuana specifically.
[01:34:45.810 --> 01:34:49.810]  I'm not going to mention the name because I don't want to give them a plug either, but
[01:34:50.810 --> 01:34:55.810]  they're shiny metal. They're cans. They got a blocking seal to them. And they come in
[01:34:55.810 --> 01:35:00.810]  all shapes and sizes. That's if you're the high roller, you're the pro. I see people
[01:35:00.810 --> 01:35:07.810]  use them to transport cannabis for the cannabis cups and stuff like that. They'll basically
[01:35:07.810 --> 01:35:13.810]  have four or five of the big pound storage ones. And there's three of them in a backpack
[01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:21.810]  on an airplane. And it's completely, no one ever knows because it's completely sealed.
[01:35:21.810 --> 01:35:23.810]  Still scary as fuck.
[01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:27.810]  That has your package, your humidifier package that he's talking about that keeps it all
[01:35:27.810 --> 01:35:32.810]  at the same humidity.
[01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:36.810]  It doesn't really tell you what it keeps it at. It says that it keeps it within a certain
[01:35:36.810 --> 01:35:42.810]  range of ambient humidity. They have so many products on it. I didn't know they had so
[01:35:42.810 --> 01:35:46.810]  much stuff. So you guys go check out the Boveda website, Boveda. Shout out to Coral
[01:35:46.810 --> 01:35:51.810]  Reefer. She's actually the one that introduced me to the Boveda products. You a big fan of
[01:35:51.810 --> 01:35:53.810]  the Coral Reefer over there, buddy?
[01:35:53.810 --> 01:35:55.810]  Go on.
[01:35:55.810 --> 01:35:59.810]  All right. So if you're going to keep your weed longer than, if you've got some herb
[01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:04.810]  that is dried and cured and you know it's not moist enough, somebody hates the word
[01:36:04.810 --> 01:36:06.810]  moist. A lot of people hate the word moist.
[01:36:06.810 --> 01:36:09.810]  Why would they hate the word moist?
[01:36:10.810 --> 01:36:13.810]  So if your weed's not too damp and you're not afraid to get mold in it, you can put
[01:36:13.810 --> 01:36:18.810]  your herb in a vacuum sealer bag and vacuum seal that shit. Vacuum sealers aren't too
[01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:23.810]  expensive. The bags aren't too expensive. Seal it up, label it, mark it. Some people,
[01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:25.810]  DJ Short says to put it in the freezer at this point.
[01:36:25.810 --> 01:36:30.810]  That's what my dad always did. He'd put it in a brown paper bag and then stick it, put
[01:36:30.810 --> 01:36:33.810]  it in a bag, put it in a brown paper bag and stick it in the freezer because that way none
[01:36:33.810 --> 01:36:35.810]  of the light would get into the brown paper bag.
[01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:38.810]  So I was going to say that also. Keep your jars and stuff in a dark place when you're
[01:36:38.810 --> 01:36:41.810]  not smoking them if you have the opportunity or if you can get an opaque jar to keep the
[01:36:41.810 --> 01:36:42.810]  lights out.
[01:36:42.810 --> 01:36:45.810]  A large quantity. If it's an eighth or a quarter, you're good.
[01:36:45.810 --> 01:36:49.810]  If you've got an ounce or a quarter pound, keep that out of the light.
[01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:53.810]  Right on. I feel really good about that question now. That took a lot longer than I was thinking
[01:36:53.810 --> 01:36:54.810]  it would.
[01:36:54.810 --> 01:37:00.810]  What about in jars? You keep stuff in jars for longer than I do, obviously. So would
[01:37:00.810 --> 01:37:03.810]  you go in there once a month and kind of dump it out?
[01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:06.810]  No. Once I feel like we're going to do a whole episode about drying and curing, once that
[01:37:06.810 --> 01:37:10.810]  process is ended, once drying and curing is done, you can put it in your jars and just
[01:37:10.810 --> 01:37:13.810]  leave it. It's almost better to leave it because every time you open it, you're introducing
[01:37:13.810 --> 01:37:17.810]  oxygen and you're changing the gases that are in the plants. The plants are actually
[01:37:17.810 --> 01:37:22.810]  releasing ammonias and chlorophylls. I haven't studied for this part, so I'm going to say
[01:37:22.810 --> 01:37:25.810]  wrong shit and a lot of people are going to correct me, but they're releasing gases inside
[01:37:25.810 --> 01:37:28.810]  of there and you're exchanging those gases.
[01:37:28.810 --> 01:37:29.810]  Okay.
[01:37:29.810 --> 01:37:34.810]  And if you quit introducing more gases, the decarboxylation and the changes will stop
[01:37:34.810 --> 01:37:37.810]  happening. Starches will quit becoming sugars. Everything will stay right where it is.
[01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:38.810]  All right.
[01:37:38.810 --> 01:37:43.810]  It's like opening a food product. You get it just gets stale eventually because it's
[01:37:43.810 --> 01:37:45.810]  a change. Same thing will pretty much happen with your weed.
[01:37:45.810 --> 01:37:50.810]  Yeah. I've talked about this on the show before. I like mine a little bit drier because I put
[01:37:50.810 --> 01:37:56.810]  mine through a grinder and still get the keef off of the bud onto my grinder. So I like
[01:37:56.810 --> 01:38:01.810]  it when I bring it home. I'll sit it in the jar and just leave the lid half on, half off
[01:38:01.810 --> 01:38:07.810]  for 12 hours and then put the lid back on. It's still moist inside the bud a little bit,
[01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:11.810]  but that outer stuff is flakier and I get dry.
[01:38:11.810 --> 01:38:15.810]  I like it a little more sticky. You get a little more flavor out of it when it's a little
[01:38:15.810 --> 01:38:17.810]  stickier. You don't let it dry out so much.
[01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:18.810]  It stinks.
[01:38:18.810 --> 01:38:20.810]  And then your joint burns a little bit better.
[01:38:20.810 --> 01:38:23.810]  There you go, iGrow culture. You got a question answered.
[01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:26.810]  Clint came over and asked a great freaking question after he got high. That was nice.
[01:38:26.810 --> 01:38:27.810]  Yeah.
[01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.810]  He also asked, since he's a new smoker.
[01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:30.810]  I did.
[01:38:30.810 --> 01:38:33.810]  He asked, so I hope we wrap that up. How to store your weed. Put it in a jar. Baggies
[01:38:33.810 --> 01:38:37.810]  are cool, but the baggie has a static electricity and it's stealing all your shit and all your
[01:38:37.810 --> 01:38:40.810]  shit's sticking to it. So keep it in a jar, a nug jug of some sort.
[01:38:40.810 --> 01:38:41.810]  All right.
[01:38:41.810 --> 01:38:46.810]  If you have to be sneaky, they sell skunk proof bags that are smell proof. They also,
[01:38:46.810 --> 01:38:51.810]  at iGrow Pueblo, they offer a duffel bag style bag and a backpack that they claim is smell
[01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:57.810]  proof. I have not tested it by putting any products in it, but they claim such and they're
[01:38:57.810 --> 01:38:59.810]  decently priced. So if they work, that's worth it.
[01:38:59.810 --> 01:39:04.810]  There's also stash cans and things like that that you can get. Of course you've seen them.
[01:39:04.810 --> 01:39:05.810]  Yeah.
[01:39:05.810 --> 01:39:06.810]  But that's hiding. That's more being secretive here.
[01:39:06.810 --> 01:39:10.810]  Yeah. I'm not really looking to keep it secret. I can keep it.
[01:39:10.810 --> 01:39:13.810]  Well, you already got it like a little case. That's all you need.
[01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:15.810]  Yeah. You're doing good. We saw what you're working with.
[01:39:15.810 --> 01:39:16.810]  Yeah.
[01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:20.810]  So his next question was a normal new guy question. How am I going to pass my P test?
[01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:22.810]  Working sucks, right? Everybody?
[01:39:22.810 --> 01:39:23.810]  Yes.
[01:39:23.810 --> 01:39:24.810]  Working for the man does suck.
[01:39:24.810 --> 01:39:28.810]  Guys, you with me? Ladies, you listening?
[01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:29.810]  Working sucks.
[01:39:29.810 --> 01:39:35.810]  If you guys want to tweet all that stuff at tall Clint and that not at I grow culture,
[01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:39.810]  you can go ahead and send your comments to at tall Clint ladies.
[01:39:39.810 --> 01:39:42.810]  No, I meant.
[01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:43.810]  No, I get you.
[01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:51.810]  Watch us work. Anyway, work sucks, but I like my job. Unfortunately, my job does not like
[01:39:51.810 --> 01:39:59.810]  people that smoke marijuana and it sucks because I like my job and if I could quit, I would, but it's just.
[01:39:59.810 --> 01:40:01.810]  Got to eat. Life's expensive.
[01:40:01.810 --> 01:40:08.810]  I got three women asking me for money all the time and I got a family, but I'm pumped.
[01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:11.810]  No, it's.
[01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:13.810]  Jeff's cracking up here.
[01:40:13.810 --> 01:40:17.810]  Guys, if you want somebody to come crash your podcast, invite a comedian.
[01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:19.810]  Just destroy this.
[01:40:19.810 --> 01:40:20.810]  I love it.
[01:40:20.810 --> 01:40:22.810]  Anyway, we need to loosen up and have more fun on this show.
[01:40:22.810 --> 01:40:24.810]  It's always been real tight reading news today on the news.
[01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.810]  There was weed stuff.
[01:40:26.810 --> 01:40:28.810]  I like that. We got somebody here to just.
[01:40:28.810 --> 01:40:29.810]  What's that character's name?
[01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:30.810]  I don't know, but he was good.
[01:40:30.810 --> 01:40:31.810]  He needs to stick around.
[01:40:31.810 --> 01:40:32.810]  Let me ask you this.
[01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:39.810]  Are you worried about them popping random drug tests or are you worried about getting hurt and them wanting you to pee in a cup for workers?
[01:40:39.810 --> 01:40:43.810]  Those are the two times that I can get a few ways.
[01:40:44.810 --> 01:40:47.810]  I mean, like randoms are.
[01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:52.810]  I don't know that anybody that's coming from a weed smoker that's dealt with this, you know, time and time again.
[01:40:52.810 --> 01:40:53.810]  Randoms.
[01:40:53.810 --> 01:40:55.810]  It's just the dice that you're rolling.
[01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:57.810]  I've got a solution.
[01:40:57.810 --> 01:41:06.810]  This is the IRI genetics only surefire way that I think I know how to get past a drug test that has worked for me multiple times when I was a heavy smoker.
[01:41:06.810 --> 01:41:12.810]  I actually went 63 days without smoking cannabis at one point and took a P test.
[01:41:12.810 --> 01:41:13.810]  I was trying to get a bad ass job.
[01:41:13.810 --> 01:41:14.810]  I was promised a killer job.
[01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:16.810]  63 days and could not pass.
[01:41:16.810 --> 01:41:17.810]  I was still hot.
[01:41:17.810 --> 01:41:18.810]  I was drinking cranberry juice.
[01:41:18.810 --> 01:41:19.810]  I was killing the water.
[01:41:19.810 --> 01:41:21.810]  Still had a P test.
[01:41:21.810 --> 01:41:23.810]  My family was mad at me like you fucked it up.
[01:41:23.810 --> 01:41:24.810]  You've been smoking pot.
[01:41:24.810 --> 01:41:26.810]  And I was like, honestly, I went to reggae on the rocks and didn't smoke weed.
[01:41:26.810 --> 01:41:28.810]  Like I quit from the 4th of July.
[01:41:28.810 --> 01:41:34.810]  I puffed down and then for 90 days after that or 63 days after that, I didn't smoke and still could not get this job that I wanted.
[01:41:34.810 --> 01:41:37.810]  And I told them I was like, I haven't smoked in 65, 63 days.
[01:41:37.810 --> 01:41:39.810]  And they're like, sorry, you still didn't.
[01:41:39.810 --> 01:41:40.810]  Can you give me 30 more days?
[01:41:40.810 --> 01:41:41.810]  And they were already hiring for the position.
[01:41:41.810 --> 01:41:42.810]  So it was gone.
[01:41:42.810 --> 01:41:49.810]  But so the next time I needed to take a P test, I could not risk my P even going in the cup, honestly.
[01:41:49.810 --> 01:41:57.810]  So your best bet is to use fake piss because they are not checking for fake piss or piss.
[01:41:57.810 --> 01:42:01.810]  They're looking for THC, crystal meth, opiates, ecstasy, whatever.
[01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:07.810]  In our case, hopefully, guys, if you're listening to my show, hopefully the only thing they're going to find in your P is some fucking medicine, some cannabis.
[01:42:07.810 --> 01:42:09.810]  But that's not my spot to judge.
[01:42:09.810 --> 01:42:13.810]  So they sell a product that is straight up fake piss.
[01:42:13.810 --> 01:42:15.810]  It is designed to be fake piss.
[01:42:15.810 --> 01:42:17.810]  It's usually at some kind of a head shop around here.
[01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:18.810]  There's a couple spots you can go.
[01:42:18.810 --> 01:42:20.810]  You guys all know where they are if you live around here.
[01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:21.810]  Yeah.
[01:42:21.810 --> 01:42:22.810]  Yeah.
[01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:23.810]  There's two spots.
[01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:24.810]  I don't endorse either one of them.
[01:42:24.810 --> 01:42:25.810]  They're going to work out a sponsorship if they want me to say their names.
[01:42:25.810 --> 01:42:27.810]  Yeah, start paying us, Mr. Money.
[01:42:27.810 --> 01:42:33.810]  So you go there and you get this fake P and it's got a thermometer on the side of the container.
[01:42:33.810 --> 01:42:35.810]  The bottle has a thermometer on it.
[01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:39.810]  It should come with a glove warmer for the winter.
[01:42:39.810 --> 01:42:43.810]  You crack the thing open, you put your gloves, you put it in your gloves and it warms your hands in the winter.
[01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:44.810]  It comes with one of those.
[01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:46.810]  If it doesn't, you got to go buy one.
[01:42:46.810 --> 01:42:51.810]  So what I do, this is how I surefire passed more than one drug test.
[01:42:51.810 --> 01:42:56.810]  I get this product and I microwaved it for seven seconds in my microwave and that made it a little too hot.
[01:42:56.810 --> 01:43:03.810]  So I took a sock and I cut the sock off and I stapled it to the inside of my boxers to where it looked like it was my dick swinging.
[01:43:03.810 --> 01:43:08.810]  I put that warmed up bottle of microwaved fake piss in the sock.
[01:43:08.810 --> 01:43:12.810]  I could tell that it was going to be warm enough.
[01:43:12.810 --> 01:43:13.810]  I went too long in the microwave.
[01:43:13.810 --> 01:43:14.810]  The thing got down.
[01:43:14.810 --> 01:43:17.810]  You need it between 96 and 100 degrees is where you need it to get.
[01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:18.810]  That's where your body is.
[01:43:18.810 --> 01:43:19.810]  So I let it cool down.
[01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:20.810]  Let me intervene here.
[01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:25.810]  I just used the heater in the car and a plastic bag in my boxer line.
[01:43:25.810 --> 01:43:28.810]  It's not probation.
[01:43:28.810 --> 01:43:30.810]  It's not jail.
[01:43:30.810 --> 01:43:32.810]  No one should be watching you piss.
[01:43:32.810 --> 01:43:39.810]  They should be taking you to a lab and you should be going into a closed area where you can pull out your dick and go, woo.
[01:43:39.810 --> 01:43:41.810]  Right, but they wash your hands and check your pockets.
[01:43:41.810 --> 01:43:43.810]  Well, that's what I'm saying in the boxer line.
[01:43:43.810 --> 01:43:48.810]  So I got this swinging sock with a fake pee in it that's been microwaved and I've let it cool down.
[01:43:48.810 --> 01:43:52.810]  I've driven around long enough to let it get to the right temperature because you've got so much time to get there.
[01:43:52.810 --> 01:43:54.810]  Hopefully, if you're a union worker, I would assume.
[01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:56.810]  They're going to send you to a lab.
[01:43:56.810 --> 01:43:57.810]  You get a couple minutes.
[01:43:57.810 --> 01:43:58.810]  You get off of work.
[01:43:58.810 --> 01:44:04.810]  You get a couple minutes to go drive by the house or 7-Eleven even and hit the I got to piss and run into 7-Eleven and use their microwave or a crack.
[01:44:04.810 --> 01:44:05.810]  Have that.
[01:44:05.810 --> 01:44:11.810]  So you're going to if you're working a job where you might get pee tested, you need this shit in your locker or in your truck or somewhere close.
[01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:14.810]  If you can carry this fake piss in your cigarette pack, you're a fucking genius.
[01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:15.810]  It's a small bottle.
[01:44:15.810 --> 01:44:16.810]  You don't need a lot.
[01:44:16.810 --> 01:44:17.810]  It's a little tiny bottle.
[01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:18.810]  So you got fake pee.
[01:44:18.810 --> 01:44:20.810]  Keep it in your shirt pocket.
[01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:21.810]  Do something.
[01:44:21.810 --> 01:44:22.810]  So you get hit with this pee test.
[01:44:22.810 --> 01:44:23.810]  You go.
[01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:24.810]  You're driving.
[01:44:24.810 --> 01:44:26.810]  Maybe they take another car to drive you to the gas station.
[01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:30.810]  I got a pee man or can we stop and get a pack of cigarettes go in there and hit that microwave for seven seconds.
[01:44:30.810 --> 01:44:32.810]  Whatever you got to do to warm that piss up to the proper temperature.
[01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:35.810]  If you got that glove cracker, use that wrap it around it.
[01:44:35.810 --> 01:44:36.810]  Put a rubber band around it.
[01:44:36.810 --> 01:44:37.810]  Put it between your legs and squeeze.
[01:44:37.810 --> 01:44:41.810]  When you feel your legs getting too warm, that shit's probably right at the right temperature.
[01:44:41.810 --> 01:44:42.810]  Yeah.
[01:44:42.810 --> 01:44:44.810]  So you got that little bottle.
[01:44:44.810 --> 01:44:46.810]  It's tucked inside of a sock strapped inside your boxers.
[01:44:46.810 --> 01:44:48.810]  Girls, you're going to have to modify.
[01:44:48.810 --> 01:44:49.810]  I don't know what you're going to do.
[01:44:49.810 --> 01:44:51.810]  You're going to look like you got a dick if you follow my method.
[01:44:51.810 --> 01:44:52.810]  Maybe it'll help you out.
[01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:54.810]  Don't wear a skirt or do.
[01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:59.810]  So pull out this little bottle and just stick it out of the pee hole you're flying.
[01:44:59.810 --> 01:45:01.810]  Stick your hand in there and stick your thumb out so it's like your dick.
[01:45:01.810 --> 01:45:04.810]  Because if they're standing behind you or something, you're going to have to be smooth.
[01:45:04.810 --> 01:45:05.810]  Stick your thumb out.
[01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:06.810]  Make that look like your dong.
[01:45:06.810 --> 01:45:07.810]  Fart.
[01:45:07.810 --> 01:45:09.810]  Always fart during a pee test if someone's watching.
[01:45:09.810 --> 01:45:11.810]  That's just mandatory.
[01:45:11.810 --> 01:45:12.810]  Fart.
[01:45:12.810 --> 01:45:13.810]  Do that.
[01:45:13.810 --> 01:45:20.810]  So I squeezed the bottle the first time I did it into the little sample cup and it went when I let go of it because it tried to suck in more air.
[01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:23.810]  So tip it up so that you don't make a bong sound when you're fucking doing that.
[01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:25.810]  Or fart right at that point if you can time it.
[01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:26.810]  Hey.
[01:45:26.810 --> 01:45:27.810]  You've got to be careful.
[01:45:27.810 --> 01:45:31.810]  So and then stick that thing, close it back up, screw the cap on, stick it back in your underwear.
[01:45:31.810 --> 01:45:33.810]  Fucking don't wash your hands.
[01:45:33.810 --> 01:45:36.810]  Leave the cup there like you're supposed to and hope that you just put enough of the right temperature fake piss in there.
[01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:39.810]  So that fake piss worked for me more than once.
[01:45:39.810 --> 01:45:40.810]  Right on.
[01:45:40.810 --> 01:45:41.810]  Yeah, fake piss.
[01:45:41.810 --> 01:45:42.810]  Don't trust my friend.
[01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:43.810]  I won't say his name.
[01:45:43.810 --> 01:45:47.810]  He had his girlfriend pee in the cup and that's how they found out that my buddy was pregnant.
[01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:48.810]  Yeah.
[01:45:48.810 --> 01:45:49.810]  Yeah.
[01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:58.810]  I definitely don't use females' piss but I have – I've never used my own piss ever.
[01:45:58.810 --> 01:45:59.810]  He's got kids.
[01:45:59.810 --> 01:46:00.810]  I don't even want to ask any questions.
[01:46:00.810 --> 01:46:01.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:01.810 --> 01:46:02.810]  So we're not trying to mask it.
[01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:03.810]  We're trying to replace it.
[01:46:03.810 --> 01:46:09.810]  Yeah, because they're not looking – yeah, there's plenty of things you can drink, eat, or whatever to take and all they've done is upset my stomach and give me diarrhea.
[01:46:09.810 --> 01:46:13.810]  And by the time you get to the lab, you've got to pee so bad that your pee is clear and they go, oh, this is diluted.
[01:46:13.810 --> 01:46:14.810]  We can't even test it.
[01:46:14.810 --> 01:46:15.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:15.810 --> 01:46:16.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:16.810 --> 01:46:17.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:18.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:18.810 --> 01:46:19.810]  They're going to come after you.
[01:46:19.810 --> 01:46:23.810]  And if you smoke like Adam and I do, I dab at least a half a gram a day, a gram a day.
[01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:27.810]  You could honestly probably quit for 15 days and you would –
[01:46:27.810 --> 01:46:29.810]  Oh, I'd probably be fine.
[01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:30.810]  Yeah.
[01:46:30.810 --> 01:46:32.810]  But don't – it's technically 30 days.
[01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:38.810]  The thing is, I don't want to quit smoking weed though, and it's just a random that's going to come up.
[01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:40.810]  So I don't want to quit.
[01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:42.810]  If I wanted to quit, I wouldn't have started.
[01:46:42.810 --> 01:46:44.810]  Then you should definitely get prepared.
[01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:45.810]  I mean that's –
[01:46:45.810 --> 01:46:46.810]  Yeah, some fake pee.
[01:46:46.810 --> 01:46:47.810]  That's one of the best options that I've heard.
[01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:50.410]  and then I would just keep hand warmers on the ready.
[01:46:50.410 --> 01:46:53.750]  Like, I'd start wearing shirts with pockets and, like,
[01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:55.450]  you know, don't touch me, you know?
[01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:57.650]  Yeah.
[01:46:57.650 --> 01:46:59.590]  One day, you're standing there talking to your boss,
[01:46:59.590 --> 01:47:01.790]  and there's this big...
[01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:02.990]  Are you lactating, Clint?
[01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:06.290]  My pocket protector's not working today.
[01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:08.430]  My nipple peed all over me.
[01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:09.790]  That's funny. That's awkward.
[01:47:09.790 --> 01:47:10.930]  There's got to be a joke there.
[01:47:10.930 --> 01:47:12.290]  Oh, there's definitely a joke there.
[01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:13.790]  Yeah, but I don't take your jokes.
[01:47:13.790 --> 01:47:15.330]  All right, good. Don't take my jokes.
[01:47:15.330 --> 01:47:16.730]  Geez. I wouldn't tell it anyways.
[01:47:16.850 --> 01:47:19.550]  I like your jokes. That's why I'm not going to use them.
[01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:22.890]  We've gone 40 minutes, 41 minutes.
[01:47:22.890 --> 01:47:24.530]  You guys want to do one more question,
[01:47:24.530 --> 01:47:25.930]  or you just want to...
[01:47:25.930 --> 01:47:27.370]  I got one more, but I bet we could go on
[01:47:27.370 --> 01:47:29.470]  for quite a while about it if we do it.
[01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:31.030]  It'll kind of make it a long question.
[01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:33.570]  I want to know what it's about.
[01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:35.470]  Well, the question was,
[01:47:35.470 --> 01:47:39.010]  what kind of lights are you using for each phase of growing?
[01:47:39.010 --> 01:47:41.010]  All right. That could be really long.
[01:47:41.010 --> 01:47:42.190]  Or it could be really simple.
[01:47:42.190 --> 01:47:44.310]  Yeah, so, quick rundown.
[01:47:44.310 --> 01:47:45.390]  I've been doing...
[01:47:45.450 --> 01:47:48.450]  I know I started off doing a bunch of grow lessons,
[01:47:48.450 --> 01:47:50.290]  and we got sidetracked because Jesse came over
[01:47:50.290 --> 01:47:52.550]  and started doing outdoor grow stuff.
[01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:54.150]  We started talking about all kinds of other stuff.
[01:47:54.150 --> 01:47:55.430]  We kind of lost track of the grow lessons.
[01:47:55.430 --> 01:47:56.750]  I promise to get you caught up on those.
[01:47:56.750 --> 01:47:58.050]  There's just so much shit going on
[01:47:58.050 --> 01:47:59.170]  that it's hard to even catch up.
[01:47:59.170 --> 01:48:00.490]  We get sidetracked.
[01:48:00.490 --> 01:48:02.330]  Just stay tuned. It's a busy season.
[01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:04.030]  It's such a great year to do a podcast.
[01:48:04.030 --> 01:48:06.470]  There's been so much cannabis news and stuff to talk about.
[01:48:06.470 --> 01:48:08.010]  That's true. It is a busy season.
[01:48:08.010 --> 01:48:09.810]  Yeah. Jesse will be here in a couple of days,
[01:48:09.810 --> 01:48:11.610]  and we're going to work on finishing up
[01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:14.810]  the drying and curing episode,
[01:48:14.830 --> 01:48:16.190]  so that'll definitely be fun.
[01:48:16.190 --> 01:48:18.530]  But what kind of lights do I use? That's where I was.
[01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:21.210]  For seedlings and stuff that's just starting,
[01:48:21.210 --> 01:48:23.330]  simple T5s are fine.
[01:48:23.330 --> 01:48:24.270]  A lot of guys-
[01:48:24.270 --> 01:48:25.170]  You mean fluorescents, correct?
[01:48:25.170 --> 01:48:27.370]  Yeah, yeah. Fluorescents. T5 fluorescents.
[01:48:27.370 --> 01:48:28.810]  T5s are the little skinny bulbs.
[01:48:28.810 --> 01:48:30.510]  So they name them T5s are the skinny ones,
[01:48:30.510 --> 01:48:31.550]  and T8s are the bigger ones.
[01:48:31.550 --> 01:48:33.250]  It's just what size they are.
[01:48:33.250 --> 01:48:35.650]  So I keep my seedlings and my clones under T5s
[01:48:35.650 --> 01:48:37.350]  until they're good and rooted.
[01:48:38.350 --> 01:48:39.590]  Depending on which room they're going
[01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:40.530]  and what I'm trying to do with them,
[01:48:40.530 --> 01:48:42.770]  sometimes they'll stay under T5s until flower.
[01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:45.330]  If I'm just doing a three gallon pot of a little plant.
[01:48:45.330 --> 01:48:46.850]  And the reason why you run T5s
[01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:47.950]  is not only because of the heat,
[01:48:47.950 --> 01:48:50.930]  but because you can get them closer to the plant, right?
[01:48:50.930 --> 01:48:51.890]  You can put them right on the plant,
[01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:54.450]  and they're more energy efficient than a big light.
[01:48:54.450 --> 01:48:55.370]  And I don't think that the plant
[01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:57.490]  really needs a thousand watt light when it's a baby.
[01:48:57.490 --> 01:48:59.570]  You can just give it enough just to end that spectrum.
[01:48:59.570 --> 01:49:00.770]  They sell two different color bulbs.
[01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:02.330]  If you get the blue ones,
[01:49:02.330 --> 01:49:04.290]  those keep your plant short and squat.
[01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:05.970]  And that's what we want for veg.
[01:49:05.970 --> 01:49:07.890]  And until your plants are two and a half, three feet tall,
[01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:08.730]  that's plenty of light.
[01:49:08.730 --> 01:49:09.570]  Don't keep them too crowded
[01:49:09.570 --> 01:49:11.350]  and they're giving plenty of space with the T5s.
[01:49:11.350 --> 01:49:13.750]  But yeah, it's definitely helpful.
[01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:15.630]  I've seen people flower with T5s.
[01:49:15.630 --> 01:49:16.470]  I have too.
[01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:17.470]  It's not impressive,
[01:49:17.470 --> 01:49:19.110]  but if you're in Tennessee
[01:49:19.110 --> 01:49:20.390]  where you're not supposed to be growing weed
[01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:21.550]  and you can't get a big light built,
[01:49:21.550 --> 01:49:23.070]  that's gonna be better than buying weed
[01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:24.230]  off of some dude on the street.
[01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:27.430]  And I've seen some people grow some pretty dank stuff
[01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:28.350]  with it.
[01:49:28.350 --> 01:49:30.750]  So to start, I like the T5s.
[01:49:30.750 --> 01:49:32.190]  Once they get a little bit larger,
[01:49:32.190 --> 01:49:34.230]  I will throw them under,
[01:49:34.230 --> 01:49:37.590]  I go straight to the thousand watt metal halide for vegging.
[01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:38.830]  I've got a nice bedroom
[01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:40.350]  with thousand watt metal halides in there.
[01:49:40.350 --> 01:49:42.510]  Keep them kind of close to the plants.
[01:49:42.510 --> 01:49:44.910]  The Hortilux, I think it's the blue.
[01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:46.050]  I forget which one they make for.
[01:49:46.050 --> 01:49:48.030]  It's the Hortilux lights they make for vegging.
[01:49:48.030 --> 01:49:50.710]  The blue one, that's awesome for vegging.
[01:49:50.710 --> 01:49:53.630]  Hortilux makes a high pressure sodium that is red.
[01:49:53.630 --> 01:49:55.030]  That's super awesome for flowering.
[01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.990]  I like to switch to that.
[01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:59.810]  Now when you step from the T5s to the bigger lights,
[01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:04.030]  just give us a range on how far you wanna keep them.
[01:50:05.470 --> 01:50:08.850]  As far, as close as you can get them within,
[01:50:09.770 --> 01:50:10.730]  you don't want them,
[01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:11.930]  you kind of wanna get them as close as you can
[01:50:11.930 --> 01:50:13.290]  without burning the plants,
[01:50:13.290 --> 01:50:16.650]  but there is a range around a thousand watt light bulb
[01:50:16.650 --> 01:50:19.050]  that is unusable light for the plant.
[01:50:19.050 --> 01:50:21.210]  It's just too intense and it's the wrong spectrum.
[01:50:21.210 --> 01:50:22.930]  So you have to back up about a foot and a half,
[01:50:22.930 --> 01:50:26.130]  two feet from the bulb is probably your best bet.
[01:50:26.130 --> 01:50:28.950]  But only the tops of your plants are up there.
[01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:30.570]  So the bottoms of your plants,
[01:50:30.570 --> 01:50:31.930]  there's a lot of factors to keep in there,
[01:50:31.930 --> 01:50:33.810]  but about a foot, 18 inches to a foot
[01:50:33.810 --> 01:50:35.690]  is probably about as close as you really wanna get,
[01:50:35.690 --> 01:50:37.730]  unless you've got some amazing cooling.
[01:50:37.850 --> 01:50:40.130]  If you've got really well ducted and ventilated lights,
[01:50:40.130 --> 01:50:42.330]  then you can get them 10, eight inches.
[01:50:42.330 --> 01:50:45.970]  But sometimes that burst of light coming right out of there
[01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.950]  isn't what the plants really want.
[01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:50.810]  That will kind of stress the plants and change the flavors
[01:50:50.810 --> 01:50:51.970]  and kind of do a few things
[01:50:51.970 --> 01:50:53.550]  that if you want a certain effect,
[01:50:53.550 --> 01:50:54.830]  that's how I achieve one effect
[01:50:54.830 --> 01:50:56.210]  when I'm trying to do something,
[01:50:56.210 --> 01:50:58.330]  is light stress the plant a little bit,
[01:50:58.330 --> 01:51:00.430]  but I don't wanna tell too much about that.
[01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:02.090]  So I'm vegging under the T5s,
[01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:05.370]  I'm moving to the metal halides,
[01:51:05.370 --> 01:51:07.670]  and then I go to high pressure sodiums to finish.
[01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:09.350]  A long time ago, I tried an experiment
[01:51:09.350 --> 01:51:11.230]  using high pressure sodiums and metal halides,
[01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:13.910]  and I honestly get the best flavors using a mixture.
[01:51:15.150 --> 01:51:16.030]  The different spectrums?
[01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.870]  Yeah, yeah, using like-
[01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:17.990]  The blue and the red.
[01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:20.190]  I got four high pressure sodiums
[01:51:20.190 --> 01:51:23.150]  with a one metal halide right in the middle of the room,
[01:51:23.150 --> 01:51:24.590]  and all the plants in the middle of the room
[01:51:24.590 --> 01:51:27.010]  were a little more dense, had a little more flavor.
[01:51:27.010 --> 01:51:29.670]  I learned that by running the old reflector
[01:51:29.670 --> 01:51:31.370]  called the Grozilla, it holds two bulbs.
[01:51:31.370 --> 01:51:34.610]  I put a 600 sodium and a 400 halide in there,
[01:51:34.610 --> 01:51:36.930]  and everything in that little tester came out dank.
[01:51:36.970 --> 01:51:39.170]  Some of the pictures of headband on my Facebook
[01:51:39.170 --> 01:51:40.930]  are actually from that hut, it was amazing.
[01:51:40.930 --> 01:51:42.650]  Yeah, I've seen those pictures.
[01:51:42.650 --> 01:51:43.490]  Super dank.
[01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:45.330]  Is headband yours?
[01:51:45.330 --> 01:51:46.610]  I did not make it, no.
[01:51:46.610 --> 01:51:48.570]  Okay, sorry, trying to plug your shit.
[01:51:48.570 --> 01:51:49.410]  Cool, nice try.
[01:51:50.810 --> 01:51:52.810]  Actually, I got to talk to Dr. Dank today,
[01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:55.490]  or Mr. Dank today, the creator of the golden goat.
[01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:57.070]  We had a little conversation on Facebook,
[01:51:57.070 --> 01:51:58.010]  that was kind of nice,
[01:51:58.010 --> 01:51:59.250]  because I did not create golden goat.
[01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:00.750]  A lot of people try to give me credit for that.
[01:52:00.750 --> 01:52:03.570]  Mr. Dank created golden goat, I simply put it into seed.
[01:52:03.570 --> 01:52:06.090]  I reverse the female, made a male out of it,
[01:52:06.090 --> 01:52:07.850]  put the pollen on another female,
[01:52:07.850 --> 01:52:09.170]  and I made seeds out of it.
[01:52:09.170 --> 01:52:13.250]  Yes, it's a dank cut, so I made seeds out of the golden goat.
[01:52:13.250 --> 01:52:14.730]  If you guys want to give credit to the guy that made it,
[01:52:14.730 --> 01:52:16.850]  thank Mr. Dank, he did that, not me.
[01:52:17.810 --> 01:52:19.090]  Thanks, Mr. Dank, for letting me use it.
[01:52:19.090 --> 01:52:20.850]  He actually gave me permission to put it into seed,
[01:52:20.850 --> 01:52:21.690]  and I said all he wants is some-
[01:52:21.690 --> 01:52:22.690]  Thank you for putting it into seed, though.
[01:52:22.690 --> 01:52:23.930]  Yeah, there you go.
[01:52:23.930 --> 01:52:25.810]  I thought everybody deserved good genetics,
[01:52:25.810 --> 01:52:27.850]  that's part of why I started making seeds.
[01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:31.510]  So I usually do fluorescence, halide, sodiums.
[01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:34.450]  A lot of people will ask about LEDs.
[01:52:34.450 --> 01:52:36.030]  I used to knock an LED light,
[01:52:36.970 --> 01:52:37.810]  but my friend Nancy-
[01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:38.750]  Kills it.
[01:52:38.750 --> 01:52:40.990]  She is killing it with the LED lights.
[01:52:40.990 --> 01:52:44.070]  Yeah, yeah, now she's running Capleton, too.
[01:52:44.070 --> 01:52:46.550]  They both look frosty and dank.
[01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:48.390]  Pretty much all of her stuff is on.
[01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:50.190]  I was just about to say, she's running a lot of stuff
[01:52:50.190 --> 01:52:52.330]  that's from other growers, not even me,
[01:52:52.330 --> 01:52:54.470]  that looks amazing just as well.
[01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:58.270]  What's the one that she's got, is it DB Cooper?
[01:52:58.270 --> 01:53:00.630]  That's just giant nugs, it looks really nice.
[01:53:00.630 --> 01:53:03.850]  Yeah, Nancy's doing a great job with the grows.
[01:53:03.850 --> 01:53:05.150]  Shout out, Nancy, doing well.
[01:53:05.150 --> 01:53:07.190]  Talking about women growers, you know?
[01:53:07.190 --> 01:53:09.630]  I mean, you can always get her to write something.
[01:53:09.630 --> 01:53:10.910]  Yeah, I'm gonna make a note of that.
[01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:13.530]  She's probably a well-spoken individual
[01:53:13.530 --> 01:53:16.250]  that could probably put a paragraph in that you could read.
[01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:19.030]  Yeah, there we go, support those women growers.
[01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.870]  For sure.
[01:53:19.870 --> 01:53:20.690]  I don't care what Clint says.
[01:53:20.690 --> 01:53:22.670]  Hey, I was just making a joke.
[01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:24.350]  I like that you gotta have an approach as a comedian.
[01:53:24.350 --> 01:53:26.150]  And one time Clint told me,
[01:53:26.150 --> 01:53:28.510]  go on the Chauvinist route, and I believed him.
[01:53:28.510 --> 01:53:31.110]  I got a little misogynistic.
[01:53:31.110 --> 01:53:34.070]  Yeah, there was no denying that you were good at it.
[01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:38.070]  Oh, it's really easy, and that's why I don't like it.
[01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:41.050]  Is because for me, it's easy to write those jokes.
[01:53:42.350 --> 01:53:45.730]  It's not fun, it's just not fun, it's just an easy target.
[01:53:46.910 --> 01:53:48.670]  I'm saying women are easy targets.
[01:53:50.190 --> 01:53:52.890]  I'm staring into my computer like, how do I fix this?
[01:53:52.890 --> 01:53:53.730]  Beep.
[01:53:53.730 --> 01:53:56.630]  I just took it this direction, almost on purpose.
[01:53:56.630 --> 01:53:57.550]  Anyway.
[01:53:57.550 --> 01:53:58.470]  Yeah.
[01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:59.430]  All right, guys.
[01:53:59.430 --> 01:54:01.830]  You guys got any, I'm gonna let Clint do some plugs.
[01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:03.130]  Clint has a lot of shit to plug.
[01:54:03.170 --> 01:54:05.250]  Tell us about your Facebooks, your Instagram, your shows.
[01:54:05.250 --> 01:54:06.450]  How do we call you to cuss you out,
[01:54:06.450 --> 01:54:07.890]  or do we email you to send you hate mail?
[01:54:07.890 --> 01:54:10.010]  Yeah, best way to get ahold of me
[01:54:10.010 --> 01:54:12.330]  is probably Facebook or Twitter.
[01:54:12.330 --> 01:54:15.210]  Find me on Twitter, it's at TallClint.
[01:54:15.210 --> 01:54:18.570]  And Facebook, find the Wild Cousins.
[01:54:18.570 --> 01:54:19.650]  We've been doing a lot of shows.
[01:54:19.650 --> 01:54:22.170]  We probably have about one showcase a month.
[01:54:22.170 --> 01:54:25.850]  And this one's a little rough, because it's on a Monday.
[01:54:27.230 --> 01:54:30.170]  But he's just passing through, and somehow we booked him.
[01:54:30.170 --> 01:54:32.410]  That's Ron Babcock.
[01:54:32.810 --> 01:54:34.130]  He's funny, look him up.
[01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:34.970]  He's a funny guy.
[01:54:34.970 --> 01:54:36.250]  I think I'm free that Monday.
[01:54:36.250 --> 01:54:37.890]  So for five bucks, I'll try to get there.
[01:54:37.890 --> 01:54:38.730]  I'm gonna try, for sure.
[01:54:38.730 --> 01:54:41.610]  Yeah, like a professional comedian coming to Pueblo.
[01:54:41.610 --> 01:54:43.490]  It's not like, oh, it's unheard of.
[01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:45.330]  But it's like, you guys are gonna miss it.
[01:54:45.330 --> 01:54:46.650]  And I don't want anybody to miss it.
[01:54:46.650 --> 01:54:48.210]  Like, oh, I didn't even hear about that.
[01:54:48.210 --> 01:54:49.050]  You know what I heard?
[01:54:49.050 --> 01:54:51.210]  One of my favorite bands, Baroness.
[01:54:51.210 --> 01:54:52.050]  Have you ever heard?
[01:54:52.050 --> 01:54:53.370]  They're like a metal band.
[01:54:54.650 --> 01:54:56.130]  One of my favorite bands.
[01:54:56.130 --> 01:54:58.410]  And my buddy Paul, who does comedy with me,
[01:54:58.410 --> 01:55:01.290]  told me, yeah, we had them back in 2000
[01:55:01.290 --> 01:55:03.370]  and come through and play some house show.
[01:55:03.370 --> 01:55:04.690]  They're fucking huge.
[01:55:04.690 --> 01:55:06.530]  They're like a huge band in metal.
[01:55:06.530 --> 01:55:08.850]  And they're just, like, I missed it.
[01:55:08.850 --> 01:55:10.410]  And that's why you miss it, though,
[01:55:10.410 --> 01:55:12.170]  is because you don't know what's happening.
[01:55:12.170 --> 01:55:13.690]  And there's not enough to do in Pueblo
[01:55:13.690 --> 01:55:15.330]  to where you guys can be like, oh, I was doing this.
[01:55:15.330 --> 01:55:18.650]  And it's like, well, that's fine during the fair.
[01:55:18.650 --> 01:55:20.650]  But you don't have anything to do right now, right?
[01:55:20.650 --> 01:55:22.250]  There's something going on down there every day,
[01:55:22.250 --> 01:55:23.090]  it seems like, though.
[01:55:23.090 --> 01:55:24.290]  You know, it's hard to distinguish
[01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:25.730]  what's good and what's not.
[01:55:25.730 --> 01:55:27.330]  Well, that's why I'm inviting you to this.
[01:55:27.330 --> 01:55:28.530]  For five bucks, you can come
[01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:30.410]  and watch a professional comedian.
[01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:33.130]  You can watch me be a fucking piece of shit.
[01:55:33.130 --> 01:55:36.330]  And then Paul and John are there, too, and they're funny.
[01:55:36.330 --> 01:55:39.010]  So you got two out of four, at least.
[01:55:39.010 --> 01:55:39.850]  That'll be a good show.
[01:55:39.850 --> 01:55:40.690]  No, I have faith in you guys.
[01:55:40.690 --> 01:55:43.090]  You guys, we talk a lot of trash about you,
[01:55:43.090 --> 01:55:44.810]  open-micro comedians, but you guys are getting there.
[01:55:44.810 --> 01:55:45.890]  You've been at it for quite a while,
[01:55:45.890 --> 01:55:46.730]  and you're getting there.
[01:55:46.730 --> 01:55:47.570]  You guys are funny now.
[01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:48.410]  I can only give some credit.
[01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:49.250]  I've only been doing it for a year.
[01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:51.410]  The comedy scene here has definitely blossomed
[01:55:51.410 --> 01:55:53.010]  and evolved in quite a nice way.
[01:55:53.010 --> 01:55:53.850]  Yeah.
[01:55:53.850 --> 01:55:54.690]  For sure.
[01:55:54.690 --> 01:55:57.450]  There's another one opening, so that's pretty crazy.
[01:55:57.450 --> 01:55:58.810]  It's gonna be fun.
[01:55:59.170 --> 01:56:00.410]  We're just getting there.
[01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:01.730]  Comedy heals the world, guys.
[01:56:01.730 --> 01:56:03.930]  Comedy and cannabis, they go well together.
[01:56:05.010 --> 01:56:06.570]  I guess that's a good way to end this portion of the show.
[01:56:06.570 --> 01:56:08.930]  Adam, you got anything to plug?
[01:56:08.930 --> 01:56:13.090]  Overgrowthegov.com on Twitter, 420th.com.
[01:56:13.090 --> 01:56:15.330]  Adam will be here when I do the intro and exits to the show,
[01:56:15.330 --> 01:56:17.490]  so he'll get to say a lot more cool stuff for the show.
[01:56:17.490 --> 01:56:19.010]  Clint, dude, thanks for taking a night out,
[01:56:19.010 --> 01:56:20.130]  or a little bit of time out of your night.
[01:56:20.130 --> 01:56:21.250]  You gotta get to work pretty soon.
[01:56:21.250 --> 01:56:22.090]  Yeah, it's great.
[01:56:22.090 --> 01:56:22.970]  We've kept you for longer than we should have.
[01:56:22.970 --> 01:56:23.970]  I'm doing well, buddy.
[01:56:23.970 --> 01:56:24.810]  Thank you.
[01:56:24.810 --> 01:56:25.650]  Cool, cool.
[01:56:25.650 --> 01:56:26.470]  Thanks for coming.

[01:56:32.230 --> 01:56:33.070]  We'd like you at the table.
[01:56:33.070 --> 01:56:33.890]  We do need to.
[01:56:33.890 --> 01:56:34.830]  Yes.
[01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:36.110]  All right, guys, we're gonna wrap up this portion
[01:56:36.110 --> 01:56:36.950]  of the show right here,
[01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:38.550]  and I'll be right back to do the closing.
[01:56:38.550 --> 01:56:44.530]  All right, that was another successful episode
[01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:46.130]  of the iGrow Culture Podcast.
[01:56:46.130 --> 01:56:48.250]  Before I say goodbye, I wanna give a big thanks

[02:02:55.190 --> 02:02:56.470]  All right, guys, Jesse came over
[02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:59.230]  and we pretty much wrapped up the flushing
[02:02:59.230 --> 02:03:02.710]  and harvesting and trimming section of the outdoor lesson.
[02:03:02.710 --> 02:03:04.270]  So I'm not gonna waste any time.
[02:03:04.270 --> 02:03:06.110]  Let's go ahead and get right to that.
[02:03:07.630 --> 02:03:09.310]  All right, podcast world, we are back.
[02:03:09.310 --> 02:03:11.630]  We're here to pretty much wrap up the outdoor grossies
[02:03:11.630 --> 02:03:12.470]  and Jesse's with me.
[02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:13.310]  How's it going, bro?
[02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:14.150]  Pretty good.
[02:03:14.150 --> 02:03:15.310]  How's it going, everyone?
[02:03:15.310 --> 02:03:16.470]  We're both dabbed out,
[02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:19.590]  so we're gonna have another one of those episodes.
[02:03:19.590 --> 02:03:20.790]  Grab some pins and paper, guys.
[02:03:20.790 --> 02:03:22.670]  You guys might wanna take notes for this one.
[02:03:22.670 --> 02:03:24.670]  I was told that people are writing down shit that I say.
[02:03:24.670 --> 02:03:25.710]  That kind of scares me.
[02:03:25.710 --> 02:03:26.910]  Oh, wow, yeah.
[02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:28.110]  I was at a grow store.
[02:03:28.110 --> 02:03:30.830]  I was at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.
[02:03:30.830 --> 02:03:32.030]  And I was just there to pick up
[02:03:32.030 --> 02:03:33.390]  a couple of small random items.
[02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:35.230]  And a lady at the counter turned around and she said,
[02:03:35.270 --> 02:03:37.150]  Jeff, I know you know the answer.
[02:03:37.150 --> 02:03:39.910]  And she made me come over and shop for her a little bit.
[02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:42.750]  And honestly, the solution that I gave her,
[02:03:42.750 --> 02:03:44.710]  I learned from our good friend, Jesse.
[02:03:45.630 --> 02:03:47.430]  What was the problem?
[02:03:47.430 --> 02:03:49.790]  She was trying to figure out, it wasn't a problem.
[02:03:49.790 --> 02:03:53.310]  She just wanted to know which bat guano to use
[02:03:53.310 --> 02:03:54.550]  late in the bloom season.
[02:03:54.550 --> 02:03:55.390]  For sure.
[02:03:55.390 --> 02:03:57.110]  Which one should she have used?
[02:03:57.110 --> 02:03:57.950]  The Jamaican.
[02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:58.790]  That's what I told her, bro.
[02:03:58.790 --> 02:04:00.270]  Gosh, I'm so glad I was right.
[02:04:00.270 --> 02:04:01.830]  I told her Jamaican late in the season
[02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:03.830]  and I learned that from my buddy, Jesse.
[02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:04.670]  Awesome.
[02:04:04.670 --> 02:04:05.830]  I hope you listen to the podcast
[02:04:05.830 --> 02:04:06.950]  because I told you that you should.
[02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:08.950]  And now we have proven that you're right.
[02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:11.550]  And now I've also admitted that I was only 90% sure
[02:04:11.550 --> 02:04:13.430]  that when I told you that at the grow store.
[02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:16.350]  Burn knew what she was talking about though.
[02:04:16.350 --> 02:04:17.190]  Shout out to Burn.
[02:04:17.190 --> 02:04:18.430]  You do a good job at the Hygro shop.
[02:04:18.430 --> 02:04:19.270]  It looks great.
[02:04:19.270 --> 02:04:20.270]  I appreciate it.
[02:04:20.270 --> 02:04:21.110]  Yeah.
[02:04:21.110 --> 02:04:21.950]  Yeah.
[02:04:21.950 --> 02:04:22.770]  Guys, go to Hygro Pueblo.
[02:04:22.770 --> 02:04:23.610]  The place is awesome.
[02:04:23.610 --> 02:04:24.430]  Yeah.
[02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:26.670]  We got some big news coming up.
[02:04:26.670 --> 02:04:28.230]  I can't say it yet,
[02:04:28.230 --> 02:04:32.550]  but it has to do with a really popular new lighting system.
[02:04:32.550 --> 02:04:33.510]  Ooh.
[02:04:33.510 --> 02:04:34.630]  I don't even know the news yet.
[02:04:35.470 --> 02:04:36.470]  I'm going to have to grill Jesse here in a second
[02:04:36.470 --> 02:04:38.270]  and find out what's going on.
[02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:39.110]  Yeah.
[02:04:39.110 --> 02:04:39.950]  What else?
[02:04:39.950 --> 02:04:41.950]  Oh, we got a, we got a sale on the,
[02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:44.910]  Was it Black Label?
[02:04:44.910 --> 02:04:45.750]  Yeah, Black Label.
[02:04:45.750 --> 02:04:46.710]  Black Label Nutrients.
[02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:48.050]  Are they 50% off?
[02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:50.870]  10% above cost.
[02:04:50.870 --> 02:04:52.110]  10% above cost.
[02:04:52.110 --> 02:04:53.550]  So whatever, check it out guys.
[02:04:53.550 --> 02:04:54.990]  Whatever they paid for these nutrients,
[02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:57.710]  they're going to sell them to you for 10% above that.
[02:04:57.710 --> 02:04:58.950]  But after that,
[02:04:58.950 --> 02:05:00.790]  it will no longer carry the line of products.
[02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:01.630]  Yeah.
[02:05:01.630 --> 02:05:02.750]  It's nothing wrong with it.
[02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:04.710]  It's just not a big seller for us.
[02:05:04.710 --> 02:05:05.590]  It's a small shop.
[02:05:05.590 --> 02:05:08.070]  Also, you can't carry every single line in there.
[02:05:08.070 --> 02:05:11.150]  We, we replaced it with some Botanicare products
[02:05:11.150 --> 02:05:13.550]  and we already sold out of the stuff we stocked in today.
[02:05:13.550 --> 02:05:14.390]  So.
[02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:16.010]  I recommend Botanicare strongly to everybody
[02:05:16.010 --> 02:05:17.030]  that I teach how to grow.
[02:05:17.030 --> 02:05:19.070]  So that could have some small factor.
[02:05:19.070 --> 02:05:20.990]  We're going to carry every product they have.
[02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.830]  Awesome.
[02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:22.650]  Thank you.
[02:05:22.650 --> 02:05:24.430]  Them in general, hydro products.
[02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:25.870]  Guys, if you listen to this show,
[02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:27.550]  I don't talk a lot about the nutrients I use.
[02:05:27.550 --> 02:05:28.710]  I try to keep a lot of my,
[02:05:28.710 --> 02:05:30.790]  that's kind of stuff that I like to let people experiment
[02:05:30.790 --> 02:05:31.630]  on their own.
[02:05:31.630 --> 02:05:33.310]  Botanicare doesn't pay me anything.
[02:05:33.310 --> 02:05:36.950]  Go to Hygro Pueblo, support their new, their adventure.
[02:05:36.950 --> 02:05:37.790]  Is it a venture?
[02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:38.610]  Their new business venture
[02:05:38.610 --> 02:05:40.270]  and stocking their store with Botanicare.
[02:05:40.270 --> 02:05:41.150]  It's what I recommend.
[02:05:41.150 --> 02:05:41.990]  It's what I use.
[02:05:41.990 --> 02:05:42.830]  I promise.
[02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:45.510]  I've talked about grow feeding recipes and shit.
[02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:47.710]  And all of it is included Botanicare.
[02:05:47.710 --> 02:05:51.630]  Pureblend Pro Grow, the soil-based formula.
[02:05:51.630 --> 02:05:53.670]  It smells almost drinkable.
[02:05:53.670 --> 02:05:55.510]  And for your nutrients to smell like you would almost,
[02:05:55.510 --> 02:05:56.790]  there's, I know there's chicken shit in there.
[02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:58.350]  So I will never think about it.
[02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:59.190]  But.
[02:05:59.190 --> 02:06:00.470]  Well, we got that stocked in now, so.
[02:06:00.510 --> 02:06:02.550]  It's Cannabis Cup winning nutrients right there.
[02:06:02.550 --> 02:06:03.390]  Yeah.
[02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:04.230]  Awesome.
[02:06:04.230 --> 02:06:07.230]  I've always, I've used the NC, oh crap.
[02:06:10.670 --> 02:06:12.030]  SN91 or something like that.
[02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.870]  Okay, yeah.
[02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:14.030]  Yeah, it's more their commercial line.
[02:06:14.030 --> 02:06:14.870]  Yeah.
[02:06:14.870 --> 02:06:15.710]  Yeah.
[02:06:15.710 --> 02:06:16.530]  It's good stuff.
[02:06:16.530 --> 02:06:17.370]  You get what you pay for.
[02:06:17.370 --> 02:06:19.630]  They seem to pay attention to what we're trying to do.
[02:06:19.630 --> 02:06:20.870]  And they're also good to the environment.
[02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:22.670]  They don't seem to be real dirty.
[02:06:22.670 --> 02:06:23.870]  I like that.
[02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:25.030]  Liquid Karma is a good product.
[02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:26.910]  You can add Liquid Karma to any feed regimen
[02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:28.790]  and it will help you out.
[02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:31.190]  Their, the Pure Blend Tea or whatever it is.
[02:06:31.190 --> 02:06:32.790]  Yeah, that's good stuff.
[02:06:32.790 --> 02:06:34.990]  Vitamino is a new product that they're putting out
[02:06:34.990 --> 02:06:35.950]  that is a good product.
[02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:37.270]  We got that now too.
[02:06:37.270 --> 02:06:39.350]  Foldex and a foliar spray.
[02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:40.390]  It's a good product.
[02:06:40.390 --> 02:06:41.550]  And OGT.
[02:06:41.550 --> 02:06:42.830]  See, none of these, we're not getting paid
[02:06:42.830 --> 02:06:44.550]  for any of these free commercials we're doing right now.
[02:06:44.550 --> 02:06:45.750]  It's just, this is just from our heart.
[02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:46.570]  That's what we do.
[02:06:46.570 --> 02:06:47.550]  It's what we use.
[02:06:47.550 --> 02:06:49.370]  High quality products that work.
[02:06:49.370 --> 02:06:52.310]  Yeah, I wouldn't, we don't talk about bullshit on this show.
[02:06:52.310 --> 02:06:54.470]  All right, so it is time to talk about
[02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:55.430]  the end of the grow season.
[02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:57.830]  Sorry, that music was kind of distracting both of us.
[02:06:57.830 --> 02:06:59.270]  Let's focus a little bit.
[02:06:59.270 --> 02:07:00.670]  Outdoor season's been fun.
[02:07:00.670 --> 02:07:02.110]  Nobody's stolen your shit, hopefully.
[02:07:02.110 --> 02:07:03.750]  You didn't have to shoot anybody.
[02:07:04.710 --> 02:07:05.750]  I'll accept one guy.
[02:07:05.750 --> 02:07:07.430]  I'll accept that one guy, yeah.
[02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:08.950]  Hopefully you got to harvest everything.
[02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:12.230]  Hopefully you didn't get that frost on it that one night.
[02:07:12.230 --> 02:07:13.070]  It's coming up, guys.
[02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:15.470]  If you haven't cut down yet, you're a week or two away.
[02:07:15.470 --> 02:07:17.590]  Maybe three or four weeks at the most, right?
[02:07:17.590 --> 02:07:20.150]  Yeah, either that or you're prepared for the long haul.
[02:07:20.150 --> 02:07:22.470]  Yeah, or you've got a greenhouse covered
[02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:23.510]  and you've got a heater out there.
[02:07:23.510 --> 02:07:25.390]  So if you're just out in the backyard,
[02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:27.790]  it's really time to get your shit together.
[02:07:28.590 --> 02:07:29.550]  Flushing is important.
[02:07:29.550 --> 02:07:30.870]  Even if you're, this is something
[02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:32.670]  that I've always wanted to touch on on the show.
[02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:35.630]  Let's talk for, we'll give it however much time this takes.
[02:07:35.630 --> 02:07:37.190]  We'll talk about flushing.
[02:07:37.190 --> 02:07:38.030]  Very important.
[02:07:38.030 --> 02:07:38.870]  Yeah, flushing.
[02:07:38.870 --> 02:07:40.670]  As you're feeding all of your cannabis plants,
[02:07:40.670 --> 02:07:42.630]  you are pouring, even if you're using organics,
[02:07:42.630 --> 02:07:44.990]  you're pouring stuff into the root zone
[02:07:44.990 --> 02:07:46.430]  that is staying in the soil
[02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:48.510]  and your plants are feeding off of that.
[02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:52.270]  You don't want to smoke whatever you're feeding your plants.
[02:07:52.270 --> 02:07:55.190]  You don't want that taste in your buds at the end.
[02:07:55.190 --> 02:07:56.190]  You don't want nitrogen.
[02:07:56.190 --> 02:07:57.190]  You don't want phosphorus.
[02:07:57.590 --> 02:07:59.550]  You don't want potassium in your buds.
[02:07:59.550 --> 02:08:00.390]  Tasty.
[02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:01.350]  Oh yeah.
[02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:04.390]  So the plant actually takes up nutrients.
[02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:05.830]  It puts the nutrients where they want.
[02:08:05.830 --> 02:08:08.510]  And then yes, your plants do spit out the excess nutrients
[02:08:08.510 --> 02:08:09.830]  through the roots again.
[02:08:09.830 --> 02:08:11.230]  It basically shits them right out.
[02:08:11.230 --> 02:08:12.710]  I'm keeping this real simple.
[02:08:12.710 --> 02:08:15.230]  What we need to do now is flush the toilet.
[02:08:15.230 --> 02:08:17.190]  We need to get that poop soil out of there.
[02:08:17.190 --> 02:08:18.790]  We just want clean dirt.
[02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:19.630]  For sure.
[02:08:19.630 --> 02:08:21.510]  And if you're recycling your dirt, this is a good point.
[02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:23.830]  This is where you actually start recycling your dirt
[02:08:23.830 --> 02:08:25.910]  is at the flush of an indoor plant.
[02:08:25.910 --> 02:08:27.030]  So this works for the outdoor.
[02:08:27.870 --> 02:08:29.750]  We want to do this to every cannabis plant you ever grow
[02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:31.750]  before you harvest it.
[02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:34.910]  10 to 14 days before you cut down that plant,
[02:08:36.230 --> 02:08:37.670]  water the shit out of the plant.
[02:08:37.670 --> 02:08:39.430]  Water it as much as you can.
[02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:42.510]  And from then on out, only give it clean water.
[02:08:42.510 --> 02:08:46.710]  Just clean pH if you can, but this is the end.
[02:08:46.710 --> 02:08:49.350]  So just give it a lot of clean water.
[02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:50.390]  Water it real well.
[02:08:50.390 --> 02:08:51.230]  Go ahead.
[02:08:51.230 --> 02:08:52.070]  I'll let you jump in.
[02:08:52.070 --> 02:08:54.590]  On a container plant, say it's a 20 gallon container,
[02:08:54.590 --> 02:08:56.510]  I'll give it 20 gallons of water.
[02:08:57.590 --> 02:09:00.390]  I want to see, pretty much you'll have,
[02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:05.150]  I don't know, 17 gallons of water come out probably.
[02:09:05.150 --> 02:09:05.990]  Yeah.
[02:09:05.990 --> 02:09:07.270]  Run off.
[02:09:07.270 --> 02:09:11.190]  I drag a seven gallon pot to an area where I have a drain
[02:09:11.190 --> 02:09:13.830]  and I will pour about 15 gallons of water
[02:09:13.830 --> 02:09:15.430]  through a seven gallon pot.
[02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:16.270]  And-
[02:09:16.270 --> 02:09:17.110]  Repeat it.
[02:09:18.070 --> 02:09:19.110]  Yeah, just keep pouring water.
[02:09:19.110 --> 02:09:21.550]  You get however much water you can fill that pot with.
[02:09:21.550 --> 02:09:22.390]  Pour it in there.
[02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:23.230]  Let it drain through.
[02:09:23.230 --> 02:09:24.070]  It'll pour out.
[02:09:24.070 --> 02:09:24.910]  Go back in a couple of minutes,
[02:09:24.910 --> 02:09:26.950]  pour another pitcher or a bucket or whatever
[02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:29.270]  you're using, pour more water in there.
[02:09:29.270 --> 02:09:31.470]  If you can set the hose in your plants,
[02:09:31.470 --> 02:09:32.310]  on your pot plants,
[02:09:32.310 --> 02:09:35.750]  water them until you're afraid that it's over watered.
[02:09:35.750 --> 02:09:37.830]  You're not too worried about killing them at this point.
[02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:39.090]  It is the end of the season.
[02:09:39.090 --> 02:09:40.110]  You won't over water them.
[02:09:40.110 --> 02:09:40.950]  They're outdoors.
[02:09:40.950 --> 02:09:42.310]  That water will go somewhere.
[02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:43.830]  You want to get all that nutrients off there.
[02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:46.270]  The indoor container plants, Jesse's perfect on that.
[02:09:46.270 --> 02:09:47.830]  Just water that pot as much as you can.
[02:09:47.830 --> 02:09:50.510]  If you have to, it's kind of hard to get a plant somewhere.
[02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:51.950]  If you're working a seven gallon pot,
[02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.710]  you need to get it kind of up off the ground
[02:09:53.710 --> 02:09:54.750]  so it'll drain properly.
[02:09:55.190 --> 02:09:57.150]  A shop vac is your best friend.
[02:09:57.150 --> 02:09:57.990]  There you go.
[02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.830]  If you don't have adequate drainage.
[02:09:58.830 --> 02:10:00.070]  That's kind of where I was headed.
[02:10:00.070 --> 02:10:03.430]  Or set that, a lot of you guys are growing in the basement
[02:10:03.430 --> 02:10:04.830]  and you got a dedicated bathroom.
[02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:06.230]  Set that sucker in the shower,
[02:10:06.230 --> 02:10:08.070]  put it up on two cinder blocks under the pot
[02:10:08.070 --> 02:10:09.630]  so that it doesn't go anywhere.
[02:10:09.630 --> 02:10:11.370]  And that creates a lot of drainage space.
[02:10:11.370 --> 02:10:13.310]  That water will pour right out of those bottom holes
[02:10:13.310 --> 02:10:14.130]  of the pot.
[02:10:14.130 --> 02:10:15.870]  If you've got a three gallon pot, set that.
[02:10:15.870 --> 02:10:17.830]  Put a couple of cinder blocks in your garage maybe
[02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:19.510]  where you can get some water going.
[02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:21.030]  Or if you've got a cool backyard
[02:10:21.030 --> 02:10:22.590]  where your stash is kind of hidden,
[02:10:22.590 --> 02:10:23.430]  you don't want to,
[02:10:23.430 --> 02:10:24.750]  you don't want to give your pot plants to your neighbors
[02:10:24.750 --> 02:10:26.910]  and be real careful about bringing bugs in.
[02:10:26.910 --> 02:10:27.890]  But this is the end.
[02:10:27.890 --> 02:10:29.590]  You got to flush them real good, always.
[02:10:29.590 --> 02:10:32.670]  14, it's 10 to 14 days with nothing but water.
[02:10:32.670 --> 02:10:35.310]  If you had any nutrient burn problems,
[02:10:35.310 --> 02:10:36.990]  get in there maybe a week before.
[02:10:36.990 --> 02:10:39.230]  You can, I don't think you can over flush.
[02:10:40.710 --> 02:10:41.630]  Yeah, no.
[02:10:41.630 --> 02:10:42.870]  The only thing you're going to do is kill it.
[02:10:42.870 --> 02:10:43.710]  I mean, it's going to run out of,
[02:10:43.710 --> 02:10:44.870]  it's going to be starved to death.
[02:10:44.870 --> 02:10:46.430]  You drown the roots because you're giving it,
[02:10:46.430 --> 02:10:48.070]  you know, 15 gallons every day.
[02:10:48.070 --> 02:10:48.910]  Right.
[02:10:48.910 --> 02:10:50.270]  That's, you know, this is.
[02:10:51.110 --> 02:10:55.350]  So flushing will help your plants burn better.
[02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:56.990]  They'll dry and cure better.
[02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:58.990]  They'll smoke, they'll smoke better.
[02:10:58.990 --> 02:11:00.390]  They'll taste better.
[02:11:00.390 --> 02:11:01.550]  They'll smell better.
[02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:03.790]  Have you ever smoked pot that it almost tastes
[02:11:03.790 --> 02:11:05.590]  like you just stuck your tongue in a light socket
[02:11:05.590 --> 02:11:08.550]  and like leaves that burnt shit on your tongue?
[02:11:08.550 --> 02:11:10.870]  That probably had not been flushed.
[02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:13.430]  I feel like I can name the brand of nutrients sometimes.
[02:11:13.430 --> 02:11:17.430]  Some, I can taste worm castings a lot of times
[02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:18.270]  in people's weed.
[02:11:18.270 --> 02:11:19.470]  I can taste advanced nutrients.
[02:11:19.470 --> 02:11:22.030]  Honestly, if you overdo a couple of things in botanic care,
[02:11:22.030 --> 02:11:22.870]  I can taste it.
[02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:24.910]  If you overdo it and don't flush it.
[02:11:24.910 --> 02:11:27.630]  Lucas formula always has its own.
[02:11:29.150 --> 02:11:29.990]  That's, you know.
[02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:31.950]  I think GH always has a,
[02:11:32.830 --> 02:11:34.310]  it brings out the limonene smell.
[02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:37.830]  I think a candy, lemony, lemon head candy kind of smell
[02:11:37.830 --> 02:11:38.990]  when you use GH.
[02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:40.110]  I think so.
[02:11:40.110 --> 02:11:41.470]  So if you've got something that you want
[02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:43.190]  that is a lemon strain
[02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:45.150]  and you want to bring out that lemon,
[02:11:45.150 --> 02:11:46.630]  feed it the general hydroponics.
[02:11:46.630 --> 02:11:47.870]  Also, I don't say this a lot.
[02:11:47.870 --> 02:11:50.470]  This is kind of a secretive thing that a lot of us know
[02:11:50.470 --> 02:11:52.350]  that one of those things that you have to like
[02:11:52.350 --> 02:11:53.590]  read a lot to learn.
[02:11:53.590 --> 02:11:55.190]  Stressing the plant with light stress
[02:11:55.190 --> 02:11:56.870]  and heat will bring out limonene.
[02:11:56.870 --> 02:11:58.950]  So if you're trying to lemon up your lemon strains,
[02:11:58.950 --> 02:12:00.590]  drop that light a little bit too close
[02:12:00.590 --> 02:12:02.350]  around week six of ripening.
[02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:04.750]  You know, bring out the limonene terpenoid.
[02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:05.790]  I've heard you say that.
[02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:07.230]  That'll also stress your plants a little bit.
[02:12:07.230 --> 02:12:08.390]  So you're going to have to adjust on that.
[02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:10.710]  Your top leaves are going to brown up.
[02:12:10.710 --> 02:12:12.190]  Sometimes we're not growing for pretty plants.
[02:12:12.190 --> 02:12:15.110]  Sometimes, sometimes it's what you got to do.
[02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:16.790]  Girl Scout cookies is gorgeous
[02:12:16.790 --> 02:12:18.030]  right up until about week eight.
[02:12:18.030 --> 02:12:20.190]  And then she's so ugly.
[02:12:20.190 --> 02:12:21.950]  She just goes, I'm done.
[02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:23.350]  Well, she's pretty up close.
[02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:25.550]  She's, oh man, you get to taste her head.
[02:12:25.550 --> 02:12:28.030]  Oh man, my girl's got cookies bag is in another room.
[02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:29.030]  So I'm teasing you.
[02:12:29.030 --> 02:12:31.550]  Check out this girl's Gorilla Glue number four nugget.
[02:12:31.550 --> 02:12:33.030]  I'm going to reach.
[02:12:33.030 --> 02:12:33.870]  Oh, nice.
[02:12:33.870 --> 02:12:35.270]  I actually haven't seen anything.
[02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:37.630]  That's the finished product of the Gorilla Glue.
[02:12:37.630 --> 02:12:39.230]  Everybody around here is passing.
[02:12:39.230 --> 02:12:41.670]  That looks like an old skunk nug.
[02:12:41.670 --> 02:12:42.590]  Or some-
[02:12:42.590 --> 02:12:43.710]  Or cola, I should say.
[02:12:43.710 --> 02:12:46.110]  Yeah, that's a nice shout out to Elbow.
[02:12:46.430 --> 02:12:47.870]  He does not listen to the show, I don't think,
[02:12:47.870 --> 02:12:50.270]  but I'll get him to, and he'll hear this.
[02:12:50.270 --> 02:12:51.110]  That's well done.
[02:12:51.110 --> 02:12:52.070]  He did a good job with that.
[02:12:52.070 --> 02:12:52.910]  Nice, nice.
[02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:53.790]  Gorilla Glue number four.
[02:12:53.790 --> 02:12:54.710]  I don't know if it's ready yet.
[02:12:54.710 --> 02:12:55.590]  Is it smokable?
[02:12:56.830 --> 02:12:58.310]  It's a little, it's moist.
[02:12:58.310 --> 02:13:01.470]  Hey, there's a nice little prop for when we get to curing.
[02:13:01.470 --> 02:13:02.310]  There we go.
[02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:03.630]  Some people hate the word moist.
[02:13:03.630 --> 02:13:05.350]  So I had to throw in moist out there
[02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:07.230]  because you know, it does that.
[02:13:07.230 --> 02:13:08.950]  All right, we've kind of ranted on about flushing.
[02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:10.710]  The point here is flush your damn weed.
[02:13:10.710 --> 02:13:12.310]  We can tell.
[02:13:12.310 --> 02:13:14.310]  The people that can tell, can tell.
[02:13:14.350 --> 02:13:16.070]  They're the ones that you want to impress.
[02:13:16.070 --> 02:13:19.390]  If it's hydro, flushing is even more important.
[02:13:21.430 --> 02:13:23.950]  Don't really talk about hydro growing very much,
[02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:25.710]  and there's a reason for that, but.
[02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.630]  I have zero experience in hydro.
[02:13:28.630 --> 02:13:30.310]  I run an EZ Cloner.
[02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:31.430]  That's about as far as I get.
[02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:34.670]  I've seen a sparky weed from hydro weed,
[02:13:34.670 --> 02:13:35.990]  or from hydro systems.
[02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.950]  Yeah, you're constantly,
[02:13:36.950 --> 02:13:38.390]  if you've got a res full of nutrients,
[02:13:38.390 --> 02:13:39.790]  you're constantly pumping that plant.
[02:13:39.790 --> 02:13:40.750]  It's very important.
[02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:42.750]  Actually, it's important throughout
[02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:44.390]  the entire growth cycle.
[02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:47.350]  Every couple of weeks, you should be flushing,
[02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:49.750]  and using one of those flush products, ClearX.
[02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:50.790]  I was just about to ask,
[02:13:50.790 --> 02:13:52.990]  how do you feel about those flush products?
[02:13:52.990 --> 02:13:55.830]  Not necessarily for dirt, in my opinion,
[02:13:57.110 --> 02:14:00.270]  but for hydroponics,
[02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:03.630]  you need it to help flush your medium off.
[02:14:03.630 --> 02:14:04.830]  And those things break up salts,
[02:14:04.830 --> 02:14:06.310]  is mainly what they do?
[02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:07.150]  Cool.
[02:14:09.110 --> 02:14:11.230]  They're all like a sugar of some,
[02:14:11.230 --> 02:14:12.670]  like a sucrose of something.
[02:14:13.590 --> 02:14:16.070]  I've never researched what they are.
[02:14:16.070 --> 02:14:18.790]  I don't know exactly how it works.
[02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:20.830]  I'm dancing all over the mic on Jeff.
[02:14:20.830 --> 02:14:22.430]  That's all right, I'm gonna get him in there.
[02:14:22.430 --> 02:14:23.270]  I'm gonna get him honed in.
[02:14:23.270 --> 02:14:25.070]  I'm turning myself down so that I can turn you up,
[02:14:25.070 --> 02:14:26.910]  and it'll make us sound even.
[02:14:26.910 --> 02:14:29.870]  I am super fucking stoned, so.
[02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:31.590]  I'm not getting you very well on the computer.
[02:14:31.590 --> 02:14:33.310]  Talk into the mic real good for me for a second.
[02:14:33.310 --> 02:14:35.470]  Hello, really stoned.
[02:14:36.510 --> 02:14:37.350]  Come up kinda, all right,
[02:14:37.350 --> 02:14:40.110]  you come up good enough, we'll keep you going.
[02:14:40.110 --> 02:14:41.470]  I don't know how to turn just you up anymore
[02:14:41.470 --> 02:14:42.430]  without making it weird.
[02:14:43.190 --> 02:14:44.030]  We'll do it, we're cool.
[02:14:44.030 --> 02:14:45.590]  Guys, if he's too quiet, I apologize, we're high.
[02:14:45.590 --> 02:14:46.790]  Yeah, sorry.
[02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:48.630]  So flushing your plants really good is really important.
[02:14:48.630 --> 02:14:50.230]  You wanna impress Jesse and I with your weed,
[02:14:50.230 --> 02:14:51.550]  and the only way you're gonna do it,
[02:14:51.550 --> 02:14:52.950]  the only way you're gonna win a cannabis cup
[02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:54.470]  is by flushing your weed.
[02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:56.750]  Also, you don't wanna give sick people weed
[02:14:56.750 --> 02:14:57.830]  with shit in it.
[02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:59.370]  That's not what a caregiver does.
[02:14:59.370 --> 02:15:00.990]  It's not what a compassionate person does.
[02:15:00.990 --> 02:15:02.610]  It's not what a responsible person does.
[02:15:02.610 --> 02:15:03.630]  You're on the other team,
[02:15:03.630 --> 02:15:05.850]  and you're growing that weed that should be illegal.
[02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:08.750]  You're on the reason that makes prohibition happen
[02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:11.150]  if you're growing weed that has not been flushed.
[02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:13.510]  Exactly what he said.
[02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:14.470]  The look on your face is like,
[02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:15.630]  shit, you think about that.
[02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:16.470]  Yeah.
[02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:17.310]  Not even-
[02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:18.350]  You gotta know which side you're on.
[02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:19.590]  Not even sick people.
[02:15:19.590 --> 02:15:22.790]  Like, you know, you just don't wanna put that
[02:15:22.790 --> 02:15:23.710]  in anyone's body.
[02:15:23.710 --> 02:15:24.550]  Right.
[02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:26.510]  That's a horrible thing to do to someone.
[02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:29.190]  All right, so you flush your plants.
[02:15:29.190 --> 02:15:31.790]  Now it's time, oh, we're gonna talk about de-leafing.
[02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:37.070]  After you flush, a few days before harvest time,
[02:15:37.070 --> 02:15:39.310]  you wanna get in there and take off the fan leaves,
[02:15:39.310 --> 02:15:41.510]  all those big leaves that are in your way.
[02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:43.230]  If they've got what's called a petiole,
[02:15:43.230 --> 02:15:45.630]  that's the stem that reaches to the large,
[02:15:45.630 --> 02:15:47.430]  there's some other people pronounce it differently.
[02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:48.770]  You can tweet me and argue me.
[02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:50.110]  That's just how I've read it.
[02:15:50.110 --> 02:15:53.070]  So anything with a petiole, you can reach and cut off,
[02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:54.530]  chop all those leaves off,
[02:15:54.530 --> 02:15:56.190]  clean those things out of your grow room.
[02:15:56.190 --> 02:15:58.270]  Don't just chop them and leave them on the floor.
[02:15:58.270 --> 02:15:59.710]  Those bring bugs.
[02:15:59.710 --> 02:16:00.790]  Feed them to your chickens.
[02:16:00.790 --> 02:16:02.030]  If you've had a clean grow room,
[02:16:02.030 --> 02:16:04.470]  you can possibly juice those if you're into it.
[02:16:04.470 --> 02:16:05.310]  Yeah, right.
[02:16:05.310 --> 02:16:06.270]  Throw those right in there with your kale
[02:16:06.270 --> 02:16:07.670]  and your white people smoothie.
[02:16:07.790 --> 02:16:11.990]  All right, so get in there and cut off all those fan leaves.
[02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:16.230]  You can cut off some of the outer leaf if you want,
[02:16:16.230 --> 02:16:17.950]  but you might wanna save that if you're making hash.
[02:16:17.950 --> 02:16:20.470]  Just decide how much trichome is on that.
[02:16:20.470 --> 02:16:21.510]  If there's not a trichome on it,
[02:16:21.510 --> 02:16:22.830]  you can take it off right now.
[02:16:22.830 --> 02:16:24.310]  Like you mentioned, Girl Scout cookies,
[02:16:24.310 --> 02:16:27.750]  they always have a little petiole coming out of the nug.
[02:16:27.750 --> 02:16:29.670]  Yeah, such a long one too.
[02:16:29.670 --> 02:16:31.510]  You know, depending on how far it is,
[02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:32.790]  like you said, with hash.
[02:16:33.710 --> 02:16:35.310]  Some of them are a little closer.
[02:16:35.310 --> 02:16:36.430]  I'll keep that one on there
[02:16:36.430 --> 02:16:39.230]  just because I see that little bit of resin on there
[02:16:39.230 --> 02:16:41.470]  and I can get greedy with resin.
[02:16:41.470 --> 02:16:43.830]  We're resin farmers, bro.
[02:16:43.830 --> 02:16:45.110]  That's our goal is resin.
[02:16:46.470 --> 02:16:47.990]  But yeah, if it's very long,
[02:16:47.990 --> 02:16:52.270]  I cut that fucker off, you know, coming out of the bud.
[02:16:52.270 --> 02:16:54.710]  So clarify that a little bit.
[02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:59.590]  I found a knob that'll turn everything up a little, yeah.
[02:16:59.590 --> 02:17:00.430]  Nice.
[02:17:00.430 --> 02:17:03.230]  All right, so cut off all those fan leaves.
[02:17:03.230 --> 02:17:05.470]  Now, while you're flushing,
[02:17:05.470 --> 02:17:07.630]  you've got a few days now, you know you're flushing,
[02:17:07.630 --> 02:17:08.790]  you know harvest is coming,
[02:17:08.790 --> 02:17:10.190]  you've taken off the fan leaves.
[02:17:10.190 --> 02:17:12.750]  Now's the time to prepare the harvesting,
[02:17:12.750 --> 02:17:14.830]  the trimming and the drying area.
[02:17:14.830 --> 02:17:16.110]  You need a space.
[02:17:16.110 --> 02:17:17.910]  All right, let's go back real quick to flushing.
[02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:18.750]  I like that.
[02:17:18.750 --> 02:17:19.590]  One more thing.
[02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:23.750]  How do you feel about like this weeding agents,
[02:17:23.750 --> 02:17:25.070]  molasses and stuff like that?
[02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:27.470]  Oh, I use the shit out of molasses.
[02:17:27.470 --> 02:17:28.950]  With my outdoor stuff,
[02:17:30.510 --> 02:17:32.790]  the first, I start flushing really early.
[02:17:33.710 --> 02:17:36.950]  Like I actually, I started two plants flushing this week.
[02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:42.950]  I give them two molasses feedings
[02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:44.590]  before I actually start flushing.
[02:17:44.590 --> 02:17:48.430]  And it's just molasses, but it's pretty heavy, so.
[02:17:48.430 --> 02:17:49.790]  I know what's going into my plants.
[02:17:49.790 --> 02:17:51.950]  And this is, so I try to keep it basic
[02:17:51.950 --> 02:17:53.310]  because I don't want to steer anybody wrong.
[02:17:53.310 --> 02:17:54.670]  I want everybody to learn the right steps,
[02:17:54.670 --> 02:17:56.550]  but I do sort of something similar.
[02:17:56.550 --> 02:18:00.110]  I feed them enzymes, carbohydrates and molasses at the end.
[02:18:00.110 --> 02:18:00.950]  For sure.
[02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:02.030]  So they'll get some hygrozyme,
[02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:03.310]  which is the enzymes I prefer,
[02:18:03.310 --> 02:18:05.030]  and they'll get the molasses.
[02:18:05.030 --> 02:18:08.310]  And sometimes maybe some yucca extract
[02:18:08.310 --> 02:18:10.390]  and coconut water and succanat.
[02:18:12.270 --> 02:18:17.270]  That's yucca extract and coconut water and succanat.
[02:18:17.310 --> 02:18:21.110]  On that last, and hygrozyme on that last flush.
[02:18:21.110 --> 02:18:22.510]  Day, so I've got 14 days.
[02:18:22.510 --> 02:18:23.550]  That's like day 14.
[02:18:23.550 --> 02:18:25.710]  That's a really strong mat.
[02:18:25.710 --> 02:18:27.070]  And then from then out, I flush.
[02:18:27.070 --> 02:18:28.230]  But I don't overfeed.
[02:18:28.230 --> 02:18:29.990]  I feel like I don't overfeed.
[02:18:29.990 --> 02:18:32.350]  And I've got plenty of space to flush properly.
[02:18:32.350 --> 02:18:34.430]  Like I can, I drag a plant to a watering area
[02:18:34.430 --> 02:18:36.990]  and just put a fucking hose on it until it's flushed.
[02:18:36.990 --> 02:18:38.310]  So that's, yeah.
[02:18:39.470 --> 02:18:41.310]  It's actually just, I converted the old bathroom
[02:18:41.310 --> 02:18:43.870]  that was in the work joint into just the flushing spot.
[02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:46.270]  So the guy's got to pee with no stalls.
[02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:49.550]  My building doesn't have indoor plumbing, so.
[02:18:49.550 --> 02:18:50.390]  Ouch.
[02:18:50.390 --> 02:18:51.230]  Yeah.
[02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:52.710]  Guys, if you have all that stuff
[02:18:52.710 --> 02:18:53.950]  that you're taking for granted,
[02:18:53.950 --> 02:18:56.470]  you're way ahead of the game sometimes.
[02:18:56.470 --> 02:18:57.310]  Yeah.
[02:18:57.310 --> 02:18:58.150]  There are people that,
[02:18:58.150 --> 02:18:59.070]  there are guys that have been growing
[02:18:59.110 --> 02:19:01.390]  since before we could talk about growing.
[02:19:01.390 --> 02:19:02.470]  You had to go to the hydro shop
[02:19:02.470 --> 02:19:04.070]  with your hat down and your face.
[02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:05.550]  Dude, I've got dreadlocks to my ass.
[02:19:05.550 --> 02:19:06.470]  Rent a car.
[02:19:06.470 --> 02:19:08.350]  I get looked at like,
[02:19:08.350 --> 02:19:09.310]  well, that guy grows weed,
[02:19:09.310 --> 02:19:10.950]  even if I'm not at the hydro store.
[02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:13.110]  So yeah, Colorado's awesome.
[02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:14.510]  All right, so we flushed.
[02:19:14.510 --> 02:19:16.670]  We've used some sugars and enzymes
[02:19:16.670 --> 02:19:19.350]  and coconut water and some yucca extract.
[02:19:19.350 --> 02:19:21.750]  You don't have to use them all at the same time.
[02:19:21.750 --> 02:19:22.710]  You can use these differently.
[02:19:22.710 --> 02:19:24.470]  The succulent may need a little while to break down.
[02:19:24.470 --> 02:19:26.710]  So you may need something to help that happen.
[02:19:26.710 --> 02:19:28.310]  The enzymes are going to be good.
[02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:32.230]  So we have de-leafed.
[02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:33.430]  We're preparing the dry space, right?
[02:19:33.430 --> 02:19:34.270]  Is that where we are?
[02:19:34.270 --> 02:19:35.630]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:35.630 --> 02:19:37.030]  Very, very important.
[02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:38.830]  Yeah, clean up your drying and trimming space.
[02:19:38.830 --> 02:19:41.670]  Any dust, dog hair, hippie hair,
[02:19:43.070 --> 02:19:45.110]  all the crap that's on my table.
[02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:47.190]  I think it's just a bunch of dab resin
[02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:48.030]  to tell you the truth,
[02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:50.430]  but all that shit is going to end up in your weed
[02:19:50.430 --> 02:19:51.830]  that you're cleaning up.
[02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:52.670]  And once again,
[02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:54.270]  that's just as important as having a good flush.
[02:19:54.270 --> 02:19:55.750]  You don't want crap on your weed.
[02:19:55.750 --> 02:19:58.910]  You just spent a 70 day flowering cycle,
[02:19:59.750 --> 02:20:00.910]  plus however long we took to veg that stuff.
[02:20:00.910 --> 02:20:02.150]  Plus if you're doing a pheno hunt,
[02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.990]  you're risking, you know,
[02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:04.510]  you got to tell which seeds are good.
[02:20:04.510 --> 02:20:05.830]  Or if they're outdoors.
[02:20:07.710 --> 02:20:08.950]  That's a big plant too.
[02:20:08.950 --> 02:20:09.790]  Yeah.
[02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:10.630]  Yeah.
[02:20:10.630 --> 02:20:13.030]  Put a lot of work and nervous nights into it.
[02:20:13.030 --> 02:20:15.110]  And have a nice secure area while we're at it.
[02:20:15.110 --> 02:20:16.390]  I did not write that down,
[02:20:16.390 --> 02:20:18.270]  but have a nice secure area.
[02:20:18.270 --> 02:20:19.110]  And think about this.
[02:20:19.110 --> 02:20:20.430]  If you're making concentrates,
[02:20:20.430 --> 02:20:22.950]  every piece of dust and hair and particulate
[02:20:22.950 --> 02:20:25.750]  is going to end up in your concentrate somehow.
[02:20:25.750 --> 02:20:28.390]  Like even if you're blasting butane over it,
[02:20:28.910 --> 02:20:30.910]  you're going to blast dog hair juice
[02:20:30.910 --> 02:20:32.350]  into your hash essentially.
[02:20:32.350 --> 02:20:33.190]  You know what I mean?
[02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:34.630]  I don't know technically what you're getting,
[02:20:34.630 --> 02:20:35.670]  but you know,
[02:20:35.670 --> 02:20:38.630]  that's what you're going to find in there.
[02:20:38.630 --> 02:20:40.430]  It's all going to end up in your concentrates.
[02:20:40.430 --> 02:20:41.590]  You're going to need,
[02:20:41.590 --> 02:20:42.830]  so in your trimming area,
[02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:44.230]  your work area,
[02:20:44.230 --> 02:20:45.070]  cover your table,
[02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:46.510]  get a plastic cloth.
[02:20:46.510 --> 02:20:47.670]  You guys use rubber gloves
[02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:49.150]  when you're handling your plants.
[02:20:49.150 --> 02:20:49.990]  When they're growing,
[02:20:49.990 --> 02:20:51.270]  when you're chopping them.
[02:20:52.110 --> 02:20:53.590]  For God's sake.
[02:20:53.590 --> 02:20:54.430]  Please.
[02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:57.870]  You've seen how you do fingerprints
[02:20:58.270 --> 02:20:59.110]  when you commit a crime.
[02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.950]  You're doing that to your plants.
[02:20:59.950 --> 02:21:01.550]  You're leaving oils and hippie goop
[02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:03.550]  and human goop and Cheeto stains
[02:21:03.550 --> 02:21:05.190]  all over your plants.
[02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:06.310]  Wear some rubber gloves.
[02:21:06.310 --> 02:21:10.230]  Our oils actually affect the plants
[02:21:10.230 --> 02:21:11.710]  for long-term storage
[02:21:11.710 --> 02:21:13.390]  and plants that have been handled
[02:21:13.390 --> 02:21:16.710]  with bare hands break down faster
[02:21:16.710 --> 02:21:17.670]  in my experience.
[02:21:17.670 --> 02:21:18.510]  That makes sense.
[02:21:18.510 --> 02:21:19.550]  Yeah.
[02:21:19.550 --> 02:21:20.710]  I think a BHO dab,
[02:21:20.710 --> 02:21:24.510]  you can decarboxylize a BHO dab enough
[02:21:25.350 --> 02:21:26.470]  with your fingers.
[02:21:26.470 --> 02:21:27.310]  Oh.
[02:21:27.630 --> 02:21:29.350]  By rolling BHO around in your fingers,
[02:21:29.350 --> 02:21:30.830]  you can decarbonize it enough
[02:21:30.830 --> 02:21:31.790]  to be edible,
[02:21:31.790 --> 02:21:33.790]  like processed is Delta 11 THC
[02:21:33.790 --> 02:21:34.630]  by your liver.
[02:21:35.990 --> 02:21:36.830]  That's how,
[02:21:36.830 --> 02:21:38.110]  well, that's like cannabinoids.
[02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.950]  Yeah.
[02:21:38.950 --> 02:21:39.790]  Imagine, so if you can do that
[02:21:39.790 --> 02:21:40.630]  by rolling it in your hand,
[02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:41.470]  imagine what we can do
[02:21:41.470 --> 02:21:43.190]  to a trichome on a plant.
[02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:45.350]  You can rupture it, ruin it, kill it.
[02:21:45.350 --> 02:21:46.190]  You're leaving weird oils
[02:21:46.190 --> 02:21:47.150]  that are fighting.
[02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:48.910]  When you said decarboxylizing,
[02:21:48.910 --> 02:21:50.710]  I was thinking of de-waxing
[02:21:50.710 --> 02:21:51.790]  and all that stuff floating around.
[02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:53.430]  Oh man, yeah.
[02:21:53.430 --> 02:21:54.270]  We'll talk,
[02:21:54.270 --> 02:21:55.110]  if somebody asks me,
[02:21:55.110 --> 02:21:55.950]  what is de-waxing?
[02:21:55.950 --> 02:21:56.950]  We need to get a hash maker
[02:21:57.470 --> 02:21:58.310]  and we'll go over to say
[02:21:58.310 --> 02:21:59.150]  more technically what it is,
[02:21:59.150 --> 02:21:59.990]  but I'll explain it
[02:21:59.990 --> 02:22:00.830]  on a later episode.
[02:22:00.830 --> 02:22:02.310]  Yeah, I have nothing to do
[02:22:02.310 --> 02:22:04.190]  with explaining that.
[02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:05.310]  So in your trim room,
[02:22:05.310 --> 02:22:06.430]  you should have comfy tables.
[02:22:06.430 --> 02:22:08.750]  You should have some good music.
[02:22:08.750 --> 02:22:10.190]  Everyone's gonna argue over the music.
[02:22:10.190 --> 02:22:11.950]  Sorry, put on the Agricultural Podcast
[02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:13.230]  episode one and hit play.
[02:22:14.950 --> 02:22:16.270]  I actually like to put up
[02:22:16.270 --> 02:22:17.670]  standup comedian shows.
[02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:18.510]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:19.430]  I listen to comedy.
[02:22:19.430 --> 02:22:20.830]  I honestly listen to a lot
[02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:23.030]  of Joey Coco Diaz and Joe Rogan.
[02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:24.150]  Yeah, I listen to a podcast
[02:22:24.150 --> 02:22:25.070]  when I'm trimming.
[02:22:26.070 --> 02:22:27.230]  One of my favorite podcasts
[02:22:27.230 --> 02:22:28.390]  hasn't posted an episode
[02:22:28.390 --> 02:22:29.230]  in quite a while.
[02:22:29.230 --> 02:22:30.270]  I'm a little annoyed.
[02:22:30.270 --> 02:22:31.110]  What's up Adam L?
[02:22:31.110 --> 02:22:32.550]  Where's my new podcast buddy?
[02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:35.190]  All right, I'm dabbed out.
[02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:36.230]  We gotta keep on track here.
[02:22:36.230 --> 02:22:37.390]  We're getting into the show.
[02:22:37.390 --> 02:22:38.230]  I like it.
[02:22:38.230 --> 02:22:39.630]  Preparing the area.
[02:22:39.630 --> 02:22:41.790]  The area, gloves, comfy chairs,
[02:22:41.790 --> 02:22:42.870]  good music.
[02:22:43.750 --> 02:22:45.630]  Let's go back to dry area.
[02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:46.470]  Okay.
[02:22:46.470 --> 02:22:47.310]  Preparing that dry area.
[02:22:47.310 --> 02:22:48.150]  Preparing the dry area.
[02:22:48.150 --> 02:22:49.190]  Yeah.
[02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:50.350]  Dehumidifier?
[02:22:50.350 --> 02:22:51.190]  Yeah.
[02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:52.030]  Humidifier?
[02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:52.870]  Yeah.
[02:22:52.870 --> 02:22:53.710]  Fans?
[02:22:53.710 --> 02:22:54.550]  Possibly.
[02:22:54.910 --> 02:22:56.350]  Heater and or air conditioner?
[02:22:56.350 --> 02:22:57.190]  Possibly.
[02:22:57.190 --> 02:22:58.590]  We're gonna need to keep it
[02:22:58.590 --> 02:23:00.790]  between 60 and 70 degrees.
[02:23:00.790 --> 02:23:02.150]  You can go up to 75 degrees
[02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.990]  if you need to.
[02:23:02.990 --> 02:23:03.990]  If it's in your bedroom
[02:23:03.990 --> 02:23:04.830]  or something,
[02:23:04.830 --> 02:23:05.670]  you're gonna be all right.
[02:23:05.670 --> 02:23:06.510]  Don't stress.
[02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:07.350]  Keep in mind though
[02:23:07.350 --> 02:23:10.230]  that heat is one of the biggest
[02:23:10.230 --> 02:23:11.590]  enemies of a dry in plants.
[02:23:11.590 --> 02:23:12.430]  Yes.
[02:23:12.430 --> 02:23:14.870]  And also you want it dark.
[02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:15.710]  Yeah.
[02:23:15.710 --> 02:23:16.550]  Light.
[02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:17.390]  I know it sounds weird.
[02:23:17.390 --> 02:23:18.230]  You've had all kinds of light
[02:23:18.230 --> 02:23:19.070]  beaten down on your plants
[02:23:19.070 --> 02:23:19.910]  for months,
[02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:20.750]  but now we want it dark.
[02:23:20.750 --> 02:23:21.990]  We want those to stop
[02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.830]  growing and degrading.
[02:23:22.830 --> 02:23:23.670]  We want to stop it.
[02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:25.350]  We want to kind of suspend
[02:23:25.350 --> 02:23:26.790]  the animation right where we are.
[02:23:26.790 --> 02:23:29.670]  It protects the trichromeds.
[02:23:29.670 --> 02:23:30.510]  Yes.
[02:23:30.510 --> 02:23:31.350]  Yes.
[02:23:31.350 --> 02:23:32.190]  We want to,
[02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:33.030]  we picked them at the right maturity.
[02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.910]  We don't want them going much further.
[02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:35.350]  We also want our humidity
[02:23:35.350 --> 02:23:37.510]  at 40% if we can.
[02:23:37.510 --> 02:23:38.790]  Not much more than that.
[02:23:38.790 --> 02:23:39.630]  If you go any lower,
[02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:40.550]  you're gonna dry too quickly.
[02:23:40.550 --> 02:23:42.470]  If you go any higher,
[02:23:42.470 --> 02:23:43.630]  of course you risk molds
[02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:44.470]  and it's gonna take
[02:23:44.470 --> 02:23:45.510]  too damn long to dry.
[02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:46.990]  If you're in the dirty South,
[02:23:46.990 --> 02:23:48.190]  do the best you can.
[02:23:48.190 --> 02:23:49.030]  Good luck.
[02:23:49.030 --> 02:23:49.870]  Yeah.
[02:23:49.870 --> 02:23:50.710]  Us in Colorado,
[02:23:50.710 --> 02:23:51.550]  it's funny that you say that
[02:23:51.550 --> 02:23:52.870]  because in the South
[02:23:52.910 --> 02:23:53.750]  you read stories.
[02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:54.590]  They're like,
[02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:55.430]  so when you harvest your weed,
[02:23:55.430 --> 02:23:56.590]  you got to dry it for 20 days.
[02:23:56.590 --> 02:23:57.430]  And I'm like,
[02:23:57.430 --> 02:23:58.270]  what the fuck?
[02:23:58.270 --> 02:23:59.110]  20 days.
[02:23:59.110 --> 02:23:59.950]  And then you read in Colorado,
[02:23:59.950 --> 02:24:00.770]  you're like,
[02:24:00.770 --> 02:24:01.750]  so cut it down five days later,
[02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:02.710]  you got dried buds.
[02:24:02.710 --> 02:24:03.550]  You're like,
[02:24:03.550 --> 02:24:04.370]  oh yeah,
[02:24:04.370 --> 02:24:05.210]  they must be in Colorado
[02:24:05.210 --> 02:24:06.150]  in February.
[02:24:06.150 --> 02:24:08.510]  It really varies from region to region.
[02:24:08.510 --> 02:24:09.350]  Yeah.
[02:24:09.350 --> 02:24:10.950]  And even like what side of the state you're on.
[02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:12.550]  Humans dry out in Colorado.
[02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:13.390]  Yeah.
[02:24:13.390 --> 02:24:14.310]  Yeah.
[02:24:14.310 --> 02:24:15.150]  So you got your fan,
[02:24:15.150 --> 02:24:16.150]  you got your dehumidifier,
[02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.990]  your humidifier.
[02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:17.810]  Try to have,
[02:24:17.810 --> 02:24:18.650]  if you can afford it,
[02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:19.490]  if you can do it,
[02:24:19.490 --> 02:24:20.310]  put a carbon filter
[02:24:20.310 --> 02:24:21.710]  and a blower in your drying room.
[02:24:21.710 --> 02:24:22.790]  Yeah.
[02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:24.950]  Harvesting plants stink.
[02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:25.790]  Very much.
[02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:26.630]  Sorry guys,
[02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:27.750]  I'm choking on a dab over here.
[02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:28.950]  Harvesting plants,
[02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:32.310]  your neighbors will smell it 10 times more than you.
[02:24:32.310 --> 02:24:34.090]  You've been around them every day.
[02:24:34.090 --> 02:24:35.050]  You're so used to it.
[02:24:35.050 --> 02:24:36.750]  You're so comfortable with it.
[02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:38.510]  I've had plants.
[02:24:38.510 --> 02:24:40.070]  I had just gotten done trimming
[02:24:40.070 --> 02:24:41.410]  and didn't have any plants on me.
[02:24:41.410 --> 02:24:42.590]  And somebody came over and they're like,
[02:24:42.590 --> 02:24:43.430]  damn dude,
[02:24:43.430 --> 02:24:44.750]  I can smell your plants from the garage.
[02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:45.590]  And I was like,
[02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:47.150]  I don't even have plants at this house.
[02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:48.510]  What's going on?
[02:24:48.510 --> 02:24:50.510]  It's just me reeking of trim.
[02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:52.410]  So I've had lady in loaf and jug
[02:24:53.050 --> 02:24:53.890]  and she always tells me I smell good.
[02:24:53.890 --> 02:24:54.730]  And I'm like,
[02:24:54.730 --> 02:24:56.490]  I'm just coming home from work.
[02:24:56.490 --> 02:24:58.770]  I'm sure the people at Lowe's know what I do.
[02:24:58.770 --> 02:24:59.610]  Yeah.
[02:24:59.610 --> 02:25:00.730]  They see me in there buying weird shit,
[02:25:00.730 --> 02:25:02.650]  smelling like dank all the time.
[02:25:02.650 --> 02:25:04.290]  The restaurant owners always love me.
[02:25:04.290 --> 02:25:05.130]  Yep.
[02:25:05.130 --> 02:25:06.330]  I know he's hungry.
[02:25:06.330 --> 02:25:07.570]  So you got that carbon filter.
[02:25:07.570 --> 02:25:09.050]  Also you need a hygrometer.
[02:25:09.050 --> 02:25:10.650]  That just tells you what the humidity is.
[02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:11.490]  And a thermometer.
[02:25:11.490 --> 02:25:12.570]  They sell a great one at Hygro,
[02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:14.050]  indoor growing supplies.
[02:25:14.050 --> 02:25:14.890]  Yes.
[02:25:14.890 --> 02:25:15.730]  Yes.
[02:25:15.730 --> 02:25:17.330]  Also that is something you can get at Walmart,
[02:25:17.330 --> 02:25:18.570]  anywhere in the nation.
[02:25:18.610 --> 02:25:23.210]  Lowe's has a remote control thermometer,
[02:25:23.210 --> 02:25:24.050]  hygrometers.
[02:25:24.050 --> 02:25:25.410]  You can set the unit in the room
[02:25:25.410 --> 02:25:27.130]  and then you can carry the thing around with you.
[02:25:27.130 --> 02:25:28.070]  And whenever you're curious,
[02:25:28.070 --> 02:25:29.330]  you look at the thing and it tells you,
[02:25:29.330 --> 02:25:31.090]  you don't have to run to the grow room and look.
[02:25:31.090 --> 02:25:32.270]  My dad has one.
[02:25:33.130 --> 02:25:35.850]  It has a chick on it.
[02:25:37.050 --> 02:25:40.510]  And he seriously got this at Lowe's or Walmart.
[02:25:41.410 --> 02:25:42.250]  But when it's hot,
[02:25:42.250 --> 02:25:43.410]  she's in a bikini.
[02:25:43.410 --> 02:25:44.250]  And when it's cold,
[02:25:44.250 --> 02:25:47.570]  she's in a coat and a scarf and everything all bundled up.
[02:25:47.810 --> 02:25:48.770]  Hilarious.
[02:25:48.770 --> 02:25:50.130]  That's a great comment.
[02:25:50.130 --> 02:25:52.130]  I can see your dad smiling at that one.
[02:25:53.970 --> 02:25:55.970]  I'm gonna put more heat on your mic.
[02:25:55.970 --> 02:25:56.810]  There we go.
[02:25:56.810 --> 02:25:57.650]  All right.
[02:25:57.650 --> 02:25:59.290]  So we've got,
[02:25:59.290 --> 02:26:00.890]  yeah, the rooms are looking good.
[02:26:00.890 --> 02:26:02.490]  We've got a place to harvest.
[02:26:02.490 --> 02:26:03.370]  We've got a place to dry.
[02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:06.690]  Now you need a spot to hang your buds or your whole plants,
[02:26:06.690 --> 02:26:07.730]  depending on how you want to do it.
[02:26:07.730 --> 02:26:09.810]  We'll talk about that in a minute.
[02:26:09.810 --> 02:26:11.970]  Set up a hanging space with plenty of space
[02:26:11.970 --> 02:26:13.450]  between your plants.
[02:26:13.450 --> 02:26:14.490]  If you have a small crop,
[02:26:14.490 --> 02:26:15.490]  you can use a coat hanger.
[02:26:15.490 --> 02:26:17.650]  Put two plants on one coat hanger if they're little,
[02:26:17.650 --> 02:26:19.810]  like three gallon pot kind of guys.
[02:26:19.810 --> 02:26:22.530]  If you've got a five gallon pot,
[02:26:22.530 --> 02:26:23.770]  hopefully you've made enough pot
[02:26:23.770 --> 02:26:26.210]  to where you need a one coat hanger per plant.
[02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:27.090]  Any bigger than that,
[02:26:27.090 --> 02:26:30.810]  we're gonna need little hanging lines from the ceiling.
[02:26:30.810 --> 02:26:32.890]  I use hemp twine and freaking hooks
[02:26:32.890 --> 02:26:34.450]  and just put hooks in each end of the wall
[02:26:34.450 --> 02:26:36.010]  and run some twine across.
[02:26:36.010 --> 02:26:37.810]  Some of you guys may not have space.
[02:26:37.810 --> 02:26:39.490]  Fishing line works good too.
[02:26:39.490 --> 02:26:41.690]  Yeah, fishing line is perfect.
[02:26:41.690 --> 02:26:43.210]  Any kind of string to hang it up.
[02:26:43.210 --> 02:26:44.330]  You just want them,
[02:26:44.330 --> 02:26:45.730]  I've seen guys take chicken wire
[02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:47.210]  and make a big cylinder out of it.
[02:26:47.210 --> 02:26:49.010]  And that way you've got a bunch of hanging spaces
[02:26:49.010 --> 02:26:50.130]  at different layers.
[02:26:50.130 --> 02:26:52.690]  That's basically what we do at the farm.
[02:26:52.690 --> 02:26:54.250]  Tomato cages work great too.
[02:26:54.250 --> 02:26:56.070]  Yeah, recycle that tomato cage.
[02:26:58.570 --> 02:26:59.490]  A long time ago,
[02:26:59.490 --> 02:27:02.010]  I harvested a crop and dried it in the hydro hut
[02:27:02.010 --> 02:27:03.290]  that the crop grew in.
[02:27:03.290 --> 02:27:04.370]  Just took out the light,
[02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:05.210]  flipped the crop,
[02:27:05.210 --> 02:27:06.570]  hung it upside down right inside there.
[02:27:06.570 --> 02:27:07.690]  Kept all the blowers going,
[02:27:07.690 --> 02:27:09.850]  kept the carbon filter going.
[02:27:09.850 --> 02:27:10.690]  Beautiful crop.
[02:27:10.690 --> 02:27:11.650]  That was awesome.
[02:27:11.650 --> 02:27:12.490]  Worked very well.
[02:27:12.490 --> 02:27:14.290]  I wish I had the space to be able to do that.
[02:27:15.250 --> 02:27:16.090]  That's nice.
[02:27:16.090 --> 02:27:17.490]  Got to keep those rooms moving.
[02:27:19.330 --> 02:27:21.730]  Avoid the drying racks if at all possible.
[02:27:21.730 --> 02:27:24.010]  Yeah, a lot of people were talking about those online
[02:27:24.010 --> 02:27:25.970]  the other day when I was talking about drying.
[02:27:25.970 --> 02:27:26.970]  Those put a dent in your,
[02:27:26.970 --> 02:27:28.250]  they make a flat side on your weed.
[02:27:28.250 --> 02:27:30.090]  They make it taste longer.
[02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:32.090]  When you start squishing the bud together like that,
[02:27:32.090 --> 02:27:34.090]  you're messing up your trichomes and your flavors.
[02:27:34.090 --> 02:27:35.730]  You're trapping in air,
[02:27:35.730 --> 02:27:36.770]  you're trapping in chlorophyll,
[02:27:36.770 --> 02:27:37.810]  you're trapping in moisture,
[02:27:37.810 --> 02:27:39.650]  which is what we try to get out.
[02:27:39.650 --> 02:27:41.010]  Raise chance of mold.
[02:27:41.450 --> 02:27:44.530]  It centralizes a whole bunch of humidity.
[02:27:46.530 --> 02:27:49.050]  And I've always felt the mesh damages the bud.
[02:27:49.050 --> 02:27:49.890]  Yeah.
[02:27:49.890 --> 02:27:50.730]  Just shaking around and stuff like that.
[02:27:50.730 --> 02:27:52.050]  Trying to poke through the mesh.
[02:27:52.050 --> 02:27:53.290]  And then you always end up with,
[02:27:53.290 --> 02:27:55.690]  I have to put something underneath those
[02:27:55.690 --> 02:27:56.930]  to catch all the stuff that falls out.
[02:27:56.930 --> 02:27:58.370]  There's so much that falls off.
[02:27:58.370 --> 02:28:01.010]  I always wonder what should I do with this?
[02:28:01.010 --> 02:28:02.370]  Although that was a few years ago.
[02:28:02.370 --> 02:28:03.690]  I know what to do with it now.
[02:28:03.690 --> 02:28:05.970]  But I quit using those, so.
[02:28:05.970 --> 02:28:07.810]  I was like, you make BHO.
[02:28:07.810 --> 02:28:09.570]  I'm not sure where you came from.
[02:28:09.690 --> 02:28:13.690]  It is useful for if you have gigantic plants,
[02:28:13.690 --> 02:28:16.170]  all the larvae and the little buds
[02:28:16.170 --> 02:28:20.570]  that you end up with inadvertently, you know.
[02:28:20.570 --> 02:28:23.370]  So, always seems like you have a pile of that stuff,
[02:28:23.370 --> 02:28:25.930]  no matter how hard you try to fight it.
[02:28:25.930 --> 02:28:27.530]  Don't be mad if you chop a bud in half
[02:28:27.530 --> 02:28:28.850]  on your first trim session either.
[02:28:28.850 --> 02:28:30.170]  That happens.
[02:28:30.170 --> 02:28:31.850]  That always happens occasionally.
[02:28:33.690 --> 02:28:35.650]  All right, so we've got the rooms built up.
[02:28:35.650 --> 02:28:37.210]  We're wearing rubber gloves.
[02:28:37.250 --> 02:28:40.650]  Let's see, have everything done before you chop down.
[02:28:40.650 --> 02:28:42.050]  Don't be scrambling around.
[02:28:42.970 --> 02:28:43.810]  Be relaxed.
[02:28:43.810 --> 02:28:47.730]  This is really when, I've seen a lot of good crops
[02:28:47.730 --> 02:28:49.250]  go right up to the point where it's time
[02:28:49.250 --> 02:28:50.170]  to put scissors to them,
[02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:52.330]  and that's when somebody fucked them up.
[02:28:52.330 --> 02:28:54.490]  Or right after you put scissors to it and trimmed it,
[02:28:54.490 --> 02:28:56.370]  and then put it all on a Tupperware while it was wet,
[02:28:56.370 --> 02:28:58.370]  or hung it out too long to dry.
[02:28:58.370 --> 02:29:00.610]  Like, this is where it counts, you guys.
[02:29:00.610 --> 02:29:04.010]  If you've spent 60 days, 70 days on a Tupperware,
[02:29:04.050 --> 02:29:04.890]  this is where the money happens.
[02:29:04.890 --> 02:29:09.890]  My aunt, in a highly illegal state,
[02:29:09.890 --> 02:29:11.690]  grew a crop when I was younger,
[02:29:13.330 --> 02:29:15.970]  and she didn't know how to handle any of this.
[02:29:15.970 --> 02:29:17.610]  And of course, there was no information.
[02:29:17.610 --> 02:29:19.490]  This was the 80s.
[02:29:19.490 --> 02:29:22.050]  She stuck it in a black trash bag,
[02:29:22.050 --> 02:29:24.130]  and then hung it in her basement,
[02:29:24.130 --> 02:29:26.530]  and then she just, she just,
[02:29:26.530 --> 02:29:28.370]  she just threw it in the trash.
[02:29:28.370 --> 02:29:30.210]  And then she just, she just,
[02:29:30.210 --> 02:29:31.530]  she just threw it in the trash.
[02:29:31.610 --> 02:29:33.090]  Hung it in her basement,
[02:29:33.090 --> 02:29:37.050]  and there were swamps in the area of the country
[02:29:37.050 --> 02:29:40.330]  she lived in, and, or not her basement, but her attic.
[02:29:41.250 --> 02:29:45.690]  And needless to say, it created a whole bunch of mold.
[02:29:45.690 --> 02:29:46.810]  That sounds disgusting.
[02:29:46.810 --> 02:29:49.850]  Yeah, a horrible waste of a summer's work,
[02:29:49.850 --> 02:29:51.850]  especially in this locale.
[02:29:51.850 --> 02:29:52.690]  Oh yeah.
[02:29:52.690 --> 02:29:53.850]  And time era.
[02:29:53.850 --> 02:29:56.570]  Risked your life for moldy buds.
[02:29:56.570 --> 02:29:57.610]  Terrible.
[02:29:57.610 --> 02:29:58.730]  She was a crazy one.
[02:29:58.730 --> 02:29:59.690]  So be prepared.
[02:29:59.690 --> 02:30:01.450]  Be a Boy Scout when it comes to growing your crop.
[02:30:02.250 --> 02:30:02.970]  You should always be thinking two weeks ahead
[02:30:02.970 --> 02:30:03.810]  in your pot plants,
[02:30:03.810 --> 02:30:04.930]  because anything you do today,
[02:30:04.930 --> 02:30:08.090]  you're not going to see it for seven to 10 days, probably.
[02:30:08.090 --> 02:30:11.410]  Anything you've messed up on in the season,
[02:30:11.410 --> 02:30:13.970]  here's your chance to, you know,
[02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:15.650]  make a little right of it.
[02:30:15.650 --> 02:30:16.490]  That's a good point.
[02:30:16.490 --> 02:30:17.690]  Yeah, get on it.
[02:30:17.690 --> 02:30:20.130]  So I guess this is the time
[02:30:20.130 --> 02:30:22.570]  where we are going to get the plants
[02:30:22.570 --> 02:30:23.810]  and harvest them, right?
[02:30:24.650 --> 02:30:25.490]  Yeah.
[02:30:25.490 --> 02:30:26.530]  Okay.
[02:30:26.530 --> 02:30:29.250]  We should also branch out to dry trim
[02:30:29.290 --> 02:30:32.050]  and wet trim a little bit before we get too far.
[02:30:32.050 --> 02:30:33.770]  The way I, I'm going to talk about how I harvest a plant.
[02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:36.170]  I'm going to hypothetically have a three gallon pot.
[02:30:36.170 --> 02:30:37.610]  I'm going to drag that three gallon pot
[02:30:37.610 --> 02:30:39.770]  with my three foot tall pot plant
[02:30:39.770 --> 02:30:43.410]  over to a nice area where I've got plenty of space.
[02:30:43.410 --> 02:30:45.450]  I'm just going to chop the whole plant.
[02:30:45.450 --> 02:30:46.290]  The way that I do it,
[02:30:46.290 --> 02:30:51.250]  I chop the plant just above where the first nodes pop out
[02:30:51.250 --> 02:30:53.090]  so that I don't have a lot of stick hanging off the edge.
[02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:54.290]  Chop that, boom.
[02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:55.770]  It's unnecessary water.
[02:30:55.770 --> 02:30:57.450]  Flip the plant upside down.
[02:30:57.450 --> 02:30:58.970]  I use a fuzzy stick.
[02:30:59.690 --> 02:31:00.530]  It looks like a pipe cleaner.
[02:31:00.530 --> 02:31:02.570]  Just wrap that bitch right around those bottom two nodes
[02:31:02.570 --> 02:31:04.490]  so that I got a nice hanger and I leave some hanging off.
[02:31:04.490 --> 02:31:06.770]  And then I tie that onto wherever it's going to hang from.
[02:31:06.770 --> 02:31:08.090]  Different situations at this point,
[02:31:08.090 --> 02:31:09.450]  I hang in different areas.
[02:31:09.450 --> 02:31:11.890]  So we'll see, I'm using my main dry room.
[02:31:11.890 --> 02:31:13.530]  Just hang it from the dry line that hangs up there.
[02:31:13.530 --> 02:31:14.890]  Boom, it's hanging in there.
[02:31:14.890 --> 02:31:16.570]  I myself dry trim.
[02:31:16.570 --> 02:31:19.290]  So I've got a plant that's been flushed, de-leafed.
[02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:21.450]  My rooms are clean.
[02:31:21.450 --> 02:31:22.450]  Everything's going properly.
[02:31:22.450 --> 02:31:24.410]  Now I've just got this giant wet plant
[02:31:24.410 --> 02:31:26.130]  that is mostly little leaves
[02:31:26.130 --> 02:31:28.690]  and just donkey dick buds hanging upside down
[02:31:29.370 --> 02:31:30.210]  in my dry room.
[02:31:30.210 --> 02:31:32.050]  The temps are perfect.
[02:31:32.050 --> 02:31:34.530]  So now if we were going to wet trim,
[02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:36.250]  this is where a wet trim and dry trim
[02:31:36.250 --> 02:31:38.130]  would branch off a little bit, right?
[02:31:38.130 --> 02:31:38.970]  Yeah, I believe so.
[02:31:38.970 --> 02:31:41.090]  Okay, just want to keep everybody on the same page.
[02:31:41.090 --> 02:31:43.890]  Sometimes we go too fast because we've done all this.
[02:31:43.890 --> 02:31:44.890]  And sometimes people are like,
[02:31:44.890 --> 02:31:47.330]  you skipped like four days worth of growth.
[02:31:47.330 --> 02:31:48.810]  So I just want to keep it all.
[02:31:48.810 --> 02:31:50.810]  So if you're going to wet trim,
[02:31:51.650 --> 02:31:53.090]  the difference between wet trim and dry trim
[02:31:53.090 --> 02:31:54.770]  is obviously you let your plants dry,
[02:31:54.770 --> 02:31:55.650]  if you're going to dry trim,
[02:31:55.650 --> 02:31:57.250]  and then you get in there and take the leaves off.
[02:31:57.250 --> 02:31:58.690]  Wet trim, you would do it right now.
[02:31:58.690 --> 02:32:00.250]  You've got the plant down, you got it hanging up.
[02:32:00.250 --> 02:32:02.250]  Now it's time to get in there and chop everything off.
[02:32:02.250 --> 02:32:03.530]  You trim it into the bud
[02:32:03.530 --> 02:32:05.090]  that's going to be smoked at this point.
[02:32:05.090 --> 02:32:06.170]  Right.
[02:32:06.170 --> 02:32:08.810]  You don't have to go as close as you look like you want to,
[02:32:08.810 --> 02:32:09.770]  because those little leaves
[02:32:09.770 --> 02:32:11.730]  are going to shrink up into the bud a little,
[02:32:11.730 --> 02:32:14.850]  but still do a hell of a good job getting in there.
[02:32:14.850 --> 02:32:17.490]  Jesse said earlier, I definitely prefer dry trimming.
[02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:19.210]  Jesse and I agree that we say dry trimming.
[02:32:19.210 --> 02:32:21.690]  We agreed earlier that some of those Southern states
[02:32:21.690 --> 02:32:23.650]  we were talking about with a lot of humidity,
[02:32:23.650 --> 02:32:25.250]  you guys may want to wet trim
[02:32:25.250 --> 02:32:26.930]  because you need to get those leaves off of there
[02:32:27.610 --> 02:32:29.410]  and kind of speed up that dry process.
[02:32:29.410 --> 02:32:32.610]  Here in Colorado, there's not a lot of humidity sometimes.
[02:32:32.610 --> 02:32:33.890]  It gets super dry.
[02:32:33.890 --> 02:32:35.050]  We're trying to slow it down.
[02:32:35.050 --> 02:32:36.010]  We need to slow it down.
[02:32:36.010 --> 02:32:37.290]  We leave those leaves on.
[02:32:37.290 --> 02:32:40.330]  So we're going to talk about, mostly about dry trimming.
[02:32:40.330 --> 02:32:42.970]  This is, wet trim is basically,
[02:32:42.970 --> 02:32:45.370]  I cut the buds off of the sticks
[02:32:45.370 --> 02:32:47.930]  to where I have a good hand-sized bud.
[02:32:47.930 --> 02:32:48.770]  We're in rubber gloves.
[02:32:48.770 --> 02:32:50.130]  I try to hold on to just a stem.
[02:32:50.130 --> 02:32:51.610]  And then I spin that bud in my hand
[02:32:51.610 --> 02:32:54.170]  and just slowly clip off all of the leaves.
[02:32:54.170 --> 02:32:57.770]  You can trim it to your preference if it's going to you.
[02:32:57.770 --> 02:32:58.930]  If you're trying to put it to market,
[02:32:58.930 --> 02:33:00.170]  you got to trim that shit close.
[02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:01.010]  It's got to look good.
[02:33:01.010 --> 02:33:03.570]  Take off, if there's not a lot of trichome on that leaf,
[02:33:03.570 --> 02:33:04.410]  take it off.
[02:33:04.410 --> 02:33:06.210]  If that leaf is sticking out, take it off.
[02:33:06.210 --> 02:33:08.090]  We don't, we're not leaf heads, we're pot heads.
[02:33:08.090 --> 02:33:10.370]  We want to smoke pot, not leaves.
[02:33:10.370 --> 02:33:12.570]  So that's basically wet trim.
[02:33:12.570 --> 02:33:15.730]  I have some patients that they don't want it trimmed
[02:33:15.730 --> 02:33:17.690]  at all with their old school.
[02:33:17.690 --> 02:33:19.050]  So I guess you should leave it on the sticks.
[02:33:19.050 --> 02:33:19.890]  Don't, I should say that.
[02:33:19.890 --> 02:33:20.850]  Leave it kind of on the sticks.
[02:33:20.850 --> 02:33:22.450]  Don't cut it into two smaller parts
[02:33:22.450 --> 02:33:24.450]  because you need a way to hang it.
[02:33:24.450 --> 02:33:26.050]  You know how the branch is a branch
[02:33:26.050 --> 02:33:27.610]  and then there's a little node coming off
[02:33:27.610 --> 02:33:28.650]  where your buds grow.
[02:33:28.650 --> 02:33:31.170]  Save one of those little branch parts as a little hook.
[02:33:31.170 --> 02:33:32.730]  And then you can hang that in your dry room.
[02:33:32.730 --> 02:33:34.530]  Because after you get done trimming these buds,
[02:33:34.530 --> 02:33:36.330]  you want to hang them up so they don't get a flat spot
[02:33:36.330 --> 02:33:38.410]  in your cure rack or your dry rack.
[02:33:38.410 --> 02:33:39.530]  You want them hanging.
[02:33:40.410 --> 02:33:44.490]  So trim them up, hang them up, and then let those dry.
[02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:47.450]  They, those wet buds need to dry after they've been trimmed
[02:33:47.450 --> 02:33:49.890]  until you grab them and bend the stick
[02:33:49.890 --> 02:33:51.850]  and the stick should pop and snap.
[02:33:51.850 --> 02:33:53.530]  It should just go crack right on you.
[02:33:53.530 --> 02:33:55.690]  And that'll be obvious when it happens.
[02:33:55.690 --> 02:33:57.450]  So depending on where you are,
[02:33:57.450 --> 02:34:01.450]  that should take between five to maybe 15 days,
[02:34:01.450 --> 02:34:02.850]  just depending on your location.
[02:34:02.850 --> 02:34:04.690]  And they dry from the outside in.
[02:34:04.690 --> 02:34:09.410]  So, where the fuck, I'm stoned.
[02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:10.890]  We're on wet trim, it's still right?
[02:34:10.890 --> 02:34:11.970]  Yeah, yeah, talking a little about.
[02:34:11.970 --> 02:34:14.130]  So like, I mean, the outside of the bud
[02:34:14.130 --> 02:34:17.690]  is going to be dry before the entire bud is actually dry.
[02:34:17.690 --> 02:34:18.530]  Right.
[02:34:18.530 --> 02:34:23.250]  So don't, you know, get too happy and jump the gun there.
[02:34:23.250 --> 02:34:26.370]  Yeah, it's really going to make a huge difference.
[02:34:26.370 --> 02:34:29.010]  Just slightly wet buds to dry buds
[02:34:29.010 --> 02:34:32.210]  to properly cured buds.
[02:34:32.210 --> 02:34:35.050]  This little, so Jesse's learning how to use a straw
[02:34:35.050 --> 02:34:36.330]  here on the podcast.
[02:34:36.330 --> 02:34:37.170]  Yeah.
[02:34:37.170 --> 02:34:41.490]  The cough wasn't that impressive.
[02:34:41.490 --> 02:34:44.650]  The look on his face was like, did I just cough from a straw?
[02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:45.850]  Yeah, you did bro.
[02:34:45.850 --> 02:34:46.690]  Yeah.
[02:34:46.690 --> 02:34:47.530]  All right.
[02:34:48.370 --> 02:34:49.210]  Yeah, wet trim.
[02:34:49.210 --> 02:34:50.050]  I don't do that.
[02:34:50.050 --> 02:34:51.290]  So let's talk about dry trim.
[02:34:51.290 --> 02:34:53.850]  Guys, dry trim, I prefer it, it's easier.
[02:34:53.850 --> 02:34:56.650]  Dry trim, you're going to hang, I hang the whole plant.
[02:34:56.650 --> 02:34:58.530]  I've heard people chopping the branch.
[02:34:58.530 --> 02:35:00.570]  I grow in, I'm talking about a three gallon pot here.
[02:35:00.570 --> 02:35:01.770]  So I'd hang the whole plant.
[02:35:01.770 --> 02:35:03.770]  Some people chop it into smaller pieces.
[02:35:04.770 --> 02:35:06.570]  If you can get it into just branches, that's cool.
[02:35:06.570 --> 02:35:07.810]  I like to let the whole thing hang.
[02:35:07.810 --> 02:35:10.250]  I feel like it dries up just the right speed here,
[02:35:10.250 --> 02:35:11.610]  just because of where we are.
[02:35:11.610 --> 02:35:14.650]  For indoor plants, I totally agree.
[02:35:15.370 --> 02:35:16.970]  You're growing those big outdoor plants.
[02:35:16.970 --> 02:35:18.850]  You've got to chop them into smaller parts.
[02:35:18.850 --> 02:35:21.770]  Yeah, outdoor plants with three levels of cages around them,
[02:35:21.770 --> 02:35:23.770]  that's not really an option.
[02:35:23.770 --> 02:35:25.050]  You can't even get out of the cage.
[02:35:25.050 --> 02:35:26.970]  And also I told somebody to cut down the whole plant
[02:35:26.970 --> 02:35:28.130]  and they said, I grow a scrog.
[02:35:28.130 --> 02:35:30.050]  So you guys are going to have to cut out branches.
[02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:30.930]  So we'll just go with this.
[02:35:30.930 --> 02:35:33.170]  We'll go, we've got a bunch of branches now.
[02:35:33.170 --> 02:35:34.450]  We're cutting off one branch at a time.
[02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:35.850]  We hang those, they dry.
[02:35:37.170 --> 02:35:38.130]  However long it takes,
[02:35:38.130 --> 02:35:40.650]  just kind of sort of similar to the wet trim.
[02:35:40.650 --> 02:35:45.450]  We're going to let them hang until right before they snap.
[02:35:45.450 --> 02:35:48.010]  When that first part snaps, now it's time to get to work
[02:35:48.010 --> 02:35:49.810]  because your stuff's going to dry slowly
[02:35:49.810 --> 02:35:50.810]  and you're going to catch up.
[02:35:50.810 --> 02:35:52.130]  You're going to get a little behind in trimming,
[02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:53.050]  but you'll catch up.
[02:35:53.050 --> 02:35:55.090]  Yeah, especially if you got a lot of work to do.
[02:35:55.090 --> 02:35:56.770]  Hopefully you got a lot of work to do.
[02:35:56.770 --> 02:35:58.890]  Had that thousand watt light created.
[02:35:58.890 --> 02:36:02.130]  Oh yeah, and the 52 ounces we're trying to grow outside.
[02:36:04.850 --> 02:36:06.490]  One ounce per week is all we need.
[02:36:06.490 --> 02:36:08.330]  That's a flashback to an old episode.
[02:36:08.330 --> 02:36:09.450]  Yeah, I hope you guys remember that
[02:36:09.450 --> 02:36:11.690]  because I got where we're headed.
[02:36:11.690 --> 02:36:12.770]  So we got these dried plants.
[02:36:12.770 --> 02:36:14.530]  You chopped your plants down, you hung them,
[02:36:14.530 --> 02:36:15.370]  you let them dry.
[02:36:15.370 --> 02:36:17.810]  Now you've cut off a stick, go to your drying area
[02:36:17.810 --> 02:36:19.450]  and you got your stick.
[02:36:19.450 --> 02:36:21.010]  Pretty much just take your thumbs
[02:36:21.010 --> 02:36:23.810]  and just knock those little dried leaves right off.
[02:36:23.810 --> 02:36:26.210]  Put them, get a little container and have that,
[02:36:26.210 --> 02:36:28.130]  or you can just knock the leaves right into that container
[02:36:28.130 --> 02:36:30.090]  because you're going to make some sort of concentrates
[02:36:30.090 --> 02:36:32.290]  out of that hopefully, or food or something.
[02:36:32.290 --> 02:36:33.330]  With your gloves on.
[02:36:33.330 --> 02:36:35.210]  With your gloves on, keep your gloves on.
[02:36:35.210 --> 02:36:36.690]  Please, I don't want to eat your skin flakes
[02:36:36.690 --> 02:36:38.010]  and your fingernail dirt.
[02:36:38.050 --> 02:36:41.690]  So you got these buds and I kind of hold it,
[02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:44.130]  or no, I kind of, I'm just picturing the way I do it.
[02:36:44.130 --> 02:36:45.250]  It looks like I'm playing Nintendo.
[02:36:45.250 --> 02:36:49.050]  I got my thumbs just going and I'm just knocking leaves off.
[02:36:49.050 --> 02:36:52.250]  It looks like he's playing snake on a Nokia phone.
[02:36:52.250 --> 02:36:54.050]  Yeah, it looks like you're texting on the iPhone.
[02:36:54.050 --> 02:36:55.130]  That's pretty much what you're doing.
[02:36:55.130 --> 02:36:55.970]  You're just holding that thing
[02:36:55.970 --> 02:36:56.890]  and just knock the leaves off.
[02:36:56.890 --> 02:36:58.330]  You don't even have to,
[02:36:58.330 --> 02:37:00.290]  you can see what you want to take off once it's dry.
[02:37:00.290 --> 02:37:02.050]  So trim it to your preference.
[02:37:02.050 --> 02:37:03.370]  These little triangle leaves that stick out,
[02:37:03.370 --> 02:37:04.210]  I'm actually trimming this bud
[02:37:04.210 --> 02:37:05.410]  that's sitting on the table with my fingers.
[02:37:05.410 --> 02:37:06.250]  These little triangle leaves,
[02:37:06.250 --> 02:37:07.930]  you can just pluck those right off.
[02:37:08.810 --> 02:37:09.970]  And you can see where the bud is
[02:37:09.970 --> 02:37:12.370]  and where the leaf ends if you've done it right.
[02:37:14.090 --> 02:37:18.250]  I use scissors, but it's the exact same process.
[02:37:18.250 --> 02:37:21.810]  Some strains, Girl Scout cookies and Yeti,
[02:37:21.810 --> 02:37:23.090]  no scissors necessary.
[02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.930]  You just roll that around in your hand
[02:37:23.930 --> 02:37:25.810]  and those dried leaves fall right off.
[02:37:25.810 --> 02:37:28.730]  Yeah, and then, so these dried nuggets,
[02:37:28.730 --> 02:37:29.570]  they're pretty much dry.
[02:37:29.570 --> 02:37:31.490]  I throw those in a bin and then when I'm done,
[02:37:31.490 --> 02:37:33.330]  I jar them up.
[02:37:33.330 --> 02:37:35.010]  That's kind of how,
[02:37:35.010 --> 02:37:37.370]  where the cure process starts for both of these plants.
[02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:40.450]  Once those sticks are snapping on your wet trim,
[02:37:40.450 --> 02:37:43.370]  take the leaves off, throw it in a bin,
[02:37:43.370 --> 02:37:44.570]  and they're ready to go into jars
[02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:46.330]  when you're done trimming everything.
[02:37:46.330 --> 02:37:48.730]  The dry trim, now that you've knocked the leaves off,
[02:37:48.730 --> 02:37:49.570]  you got that in a bin,
[02:37:49.570 --> 02:37:51.410]  now we're ready to pretty much go into jars.
[02:37:51.410 --> 02:37:54.330]  And that's kind of where the curing process would start.
[02:37:54.330 --> 02:37:55.170]  Don't you think?
[02:37:55.170 --> 02:37:56.010]  Yeah.
[02:37:56.010 --> 02:37:56.830]  Have we skipped anything?
[02:37:58.210 --> 02:38:00.050]  I'm sure we have, but I'm really stoned.
[02:38:00.050 --> 02:38:00.890]  Me too, me too.
[02:38:02.770 --> 02:38:04.770]  Do we want to get into curing on this episode?
[02:38:04.770 --> 02:38:06.970]  Or do we, we've gone 35, 36 minutes.
[02:38:07.570 --> 02:38:08.810]  Do we want to get into the cure,
[02:38:08.810 --> 02:38:11.370]  or do we want to save that for another time?
[02:38:11.370 --> 02:38:12.850]  Yeah, let's do a little homework on that.
[02:38:12.850 --> 02:38:14.450]  All right, guys, we're going to wrap it up.
[02:38:14.450 --> 02:38:15.650]  I want to thank Jesse for coming.
[02:38:15.650 --> 02:38:17.250]  We're going to hang out and leave the mics on
[02:38:17.250 --> 02:38:18.090]  for a couple of minutes.
[02:38:18.090 --> 02:38:20.290]  You got anything you want to say while we're on there?
[02:38:24.210 --> 02:38:25.050]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:38:25.050 --> 02:38:26.330]  Hi, Bern.
[02:38:26.330 --> 02:38:28.610]  I'll even admit it that I had to have been told that.
[02:38:28.610 --> 02:38:29.530]  Trying to keep you out of trouble.
[02:38:29.530 --> 02:38:31.050]  Hi, Bern, we both want to say what's up.
[02:38:31.050 --> 02:38:32.130]  The story looks great.
[02:38:33.850 --> 02:38:35.890]  I have this, nevermind.
[02:38:36.130 --> 02:38:38.170]  I'm not even going to explain it on the air.
[02:38:38.170 --> 02:38:39.410]  Attention deficit disorder,
[02:38:39.410 --> 02:38:40.410]  is that what you're going to talk about?
[02:38:40.410 --> 02:38:41.250]  No, no.
[02:38:43.610 --> 02:38:45.490]  Stuck in the old school.
[02:38:45.490 --> 02:38:47.130]  I don't like talking about certain things,
[02:38:47.130 --> 02:38:49.810]  but there's no reason not to, so.
[02:38:49.810 --> 02:38:50.650]  I see.
[02:38:50.650 --> 02:38:51.470]  Yeah, you try to keep,
[02:38:51.470 --> 02:38:52.570]  you got to keep the family life
[02:38:52.570 --> 02:38:53.850]  and the podcast life separate.
[02:38:53.850 --> 02:38:54.690]  For sure.
[02:38:54.690 --> 02:38:55.530]  I understand.
[02:38:55.530 --> 02:38:56.810]  Understandable.
[02:38:56.810 --> 02:38:58.290]  We're saying hi to the lady at the Hydro store.
[02:38:58.290 --> 02:38:59.130]  For sure.
[02:38:59.130 --> 02:38:59.970]  Hi, lady at the Hydro store.
[02:38:59.970 --> 02:39:00.790]  Hi, baby.
[02:39:02.730 --> 02:39:03.650]  Dude, really, thanks for coming.
[02:39:03.650 --> 02:39:05.530]  You make the shows, people listen when you come.
[02:39:06.170 --> 02:39:07.010]  They feel like you're an authority
[02:39:07.010 --> 02:39:08.530]  and you remind me of shit that I would skip.
[02:39:08.530 --> 02:39:09.930]  Wow, that cracks me up.
[02:39:11.170 --> 02:39:12.410]  Have I told you we're getting close
[02:39:12.410 --> 02:39:14.330]  to 1500 listeners per episode?
[02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:15.170]  That's crazy.
[02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:16.010]  Isn't that crazy?
[02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:16.830]  That's crazy.
[02:39:16.830 --> 02:39:18.290]  This little podcast from this little town
[02:39:18.290 --> 02:39:19.370]  is actually making a difference.
[02:39:19.370 --> 02:39:21.250]  We're helping people make quality medicine, dude,
[02:39:21.250 --> 02:39:23.090]  and that's what my goal was.
[02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:23.930]  What's up?
[02:39:23.930 --> 02:39:25.330]  Oh, here's something I want to talk about.
[02:39:25.330 --> 02:39:26.170]  I like it.
[02:39:26.170 --> 02:39:27.130]  I'm going to get a dab going.
[02:39:27.130 --> 02:39:29.290]  Dude, would you pass me the new dabs, the golden goat?
[02:39:29.290 --> 02:39:30.130]  For sure.
[02:39:30.130 --> 02:39:30.950]  The other paper.
[02:39:30.950 --> 02:39:31.790]  Oh, yeah.
[02:39:31.790 --> 02:39:32.610]  That one, there you go.
[02:39:32.610 --> 02:39:34.690]  Dude, these dabs are the craziest looking dabs
[02:39:35.290 --> 02:39:37.450]  He said he tipped it when he was putting it onto the thing.
[02:39:37.450 --> 02:39:39.090]  So it's got this ripple look to it.
[02:39:39.090 --> 02:39:40.090]  It's really neat.
[02:39:40.090 --> 02:39:45.090]  It looks like the floor of a golden pool or some shit.
[02:39:45.850 --> 02:39:47.090]  Yeah, it looks like,
[02:39:48.530 --> 02:39:52.010]  I can see a rapper wearing a shirt with this print on it.
[02:39:52.010 --> 02:39:54.090]  It's got like a slick Rick sort of look to it.
[02:39:54.090 --> 02:39:55.810]  I could see a couple of looks staring at that
[02:39:55.810 --> 02:39:57.890]  for a couple hours on it.
[02:39:57.890 --> 02:39:59.970]  So some kind of substance.
[02:39:59.970 --> 02:40:01.370]  Yeah.
[02:40:01.370 --> 02:40:02.330]  Shout out to Garden of Weeden.
[02:40:02.330 --> 02:40:03.450]  We're talking about your hash bro.
[02:40:03.450 --> 02:40:04.290]  Stank.
[02:40:04.290 --> 02:40:05.110]  Good work.
[02:40:05.110 --> 02:40:06.450]  What's up homies?
[02:40:06.450 --> 02:40:08.770]  Big love to everybody at the Garden of Weeden.
[02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:11.650]  I need to give, while I'm thinking about it,
[02:40:11.650 --> 02:40:13.730]  a special, special, super shout out to my friend,
[02:40:13.730 --> 02:40:16.650]  Doug Benson and also Comedy Works.
[02:40:16.650 --> 02:40:19.330]  We had the time of our lives Monday night.
[02:40:19.330 --> 02:40:20.530]  I don't want to brag too much,
[02:40:20.530 --> 02:40:24.530]  but look at the Facebook pages and the Instagrams
[02:40:24.530 --> 02:40:25.350]  and the Twitters.
[02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:27.010]  There's like a hundred pictures of me smoking
[02:40:27.010 --> 02:40:28.610]  and dabbing with Doug Benson.
[02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:31.410]  Oh, you guys don't even know the stories you can't tell.
[02:40:32.410 --> 02:40:34.770]  It's cool as hell.
[02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:37.570]  Hey, Cuss Jar, that's something you need to bring up.
[02:40:37.570 --> 02:40:40.330]  Look, I even just stopped myself from saying fuck.
[02:40:40.330 --> 02:40:41.730]  Cuss Jar.
[02:40:41.730 --> 02:40:43.370]  This is only a rule that applies to me,
[02:40:43.370 --> 02:40:45.330]  but if the guests want to participate, they can.
[02:40:45.330 --> 02:40:47.130]  The Cuss Jar, if I say the F word,
[02:40:47.130 --> 02:40:49.770]  the F word's the only one that counts in this Cuss Jar.
[02:40:49.770 --> 02:40:52.090]  If I say the F word, you guys tweet me and remind me
[02:40:52.090 --> 02:40:53.490]  every time I say it on the podcast,
[02:40:53.490 --> 02:40:55.570]  starting on episode 30, that's this show.
[02:40:55.570 --> 02:40:57.770]  Don't go back in time and cost me money.
[02:40:57.770 --> 02:40:59.810]  Every time from now forward that I say the F word
[02:40:59.890 --> 02:41:02.290]  on a show, it costs me a dollar, okay?
[02:41:02.290 --> 02:41:04.050]  After a few episodes, if I quit saying,
[02:41:04.050 --> 02:41:05.410]  if I don't quit saying the F word,
[02:41:05.410 --> 02:41:07.290]  I will increase my donation amount.
[02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:08.930]  I'll crank it up to $5.
[02:41:08.930 --> 02:41:10.930]  And then after, I'm not committing to any amount of episodes.
[02:41:10.930 --> 02:41:11.890]  I want to see how I do.
[02:41:11.890 --> 02:41:13.050]  Because if I do, the worse I do,
[02:41:13.050 --> 02:41:14.090]  the more money I have to pay,
[02:41:14.090 --> 02:41:15.130]  because it'll hurt me more.
[02:41:15.130 --> 02:41:17.250]  A dollar doesn't hurt my feelings, but it reminds me.
[02:41:17.250 --> 02:41:19.490]  $5, you go, damn, that was $5.
[02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:22.690]  10 bucks, you start going, this is getting expensive.
[02:41:22.690 --> 02:41:24.650]  So we're going to increase it slowly.
[02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:27.170]  I have a charity that I have in mind
[02:41:27.170 --> 02:41:28.570]  that I will tell you who it is.
[02:41:28.570 --> 02:41:29.650]  It's a friend on Instagram.
[02:41:30.490 --> 02:41:31.330]  We had a long conversation
[02:41:31.330 --> 02:41:32.490]  and he does deserve the donations.
[02:41:32.490 --> 02:41:33.530]  It's not an organization.
[02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:35.610]  It's actually a person who needs help.
[02:41:35.610 --> 02:41:36.450]  It's a sick child.
[02:41:36.450 --> 02:41:38.250]  So we will help that kid out.
[02:41:38.250 --> 02:41:40.210]  Every time I say the F word, here's a buck for you.
[02:41:40.210 --> 02:41:41.050]  What the fuck?
[02:41:41.050 --> 02:41:41.890]  There we go.
[02:41:41.890 --> 02:41:44.210]  You got a dollar coming your way just to get it started.
[02:41:44.210 --> 02:41:46.050]  That makes me want to make you cuss.
[02:41:46.050 --> 02:41:48.650]  Right, that was kind of a smart ass way to do it.
[02:41:48.650 --> 02:41:50.650]  But it cost me a dollar and it was well worth it.
[02:41:50.650 --> 02:41:52.530]  I get to send this guy a dollar for a sick child.
[02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:53.370]  Fuck yeah.
[02:41:53.370 --> 02:41:55.970]  And I'll still occasionally cuss.
[02:41:55.970 --> 02:41:57.730]  And we're going to start charging the guest a dollar too,
[02:41:57.730 --> 02:41:58.570]  just for that one.
[02:41:59.410 --> 02:42:00.250]  That doesn't count.
[02:42:00.250 --> 02:42:01.290]  You can say that one all you want.
[02:42:01.290 --> 02:42:02.130]  Fuck yeah.
[02:42:02.130 --> 02:42:02.970]  We're kind of rambling.
[02:42:02.970 --> 02:42:05.690]  I got a big dab here.
[02:42:05.690 --> 02:42:07.410]  I owe a huge shout out to my man, Task Rock.
[02:42:07.410 --> 02:42:10.170]  I really appreciate my brand new blue,
[02:42:10.170 --> 02:42:11.690]  highly educated carb cap.
[02:42:11.690 --> 02:42:13.130]  Isn't that stylish, bro?
[02:42:13.130 --> 02:42:13.970]  Fuck yeah.
[02:42:13.970 --> 02:42:14.810]  It's blue.
[02:42:14.810 --> 02:42:17.170]  I didn't mean to do that actually.
[02:42:17.170 --> 02:42:20.090]  So I'm going to wrap up this part right now.
[02:42:20.090 --> 02:42:21.650]  We're going to leave.
[02:42:21.650 --> 02:42:23.890]  All right guys, that pretty much wraps up episode 30.
[02:42:23.890 --> 02:42:25.970]  Mostly wraps up the outdoor grow lessons.
[02:42:25.970 --> 02:42:27.570]  I want to send a huge thank you to Jesse
[02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:29.290]  for taking time out of his grow schedule
[02:42:29.290 --> 02:42:30.650]  to come and help us out.
[02:42:30.650 --> 02:42:32.450]  It seems like the listeners really appreciate that.
[02:42:32.450 --> 02:42:34.730]  So much respect and much love to Jesse.
[02:42:34.730 --> 02:42:36.170]  Make sure you guys follow him.
[02:42:36.170 --> 02:42:40.170]  It's at jessegrowsog on Twitter and jessegrows on Instagram.
[02:42:40.170 --> 02:42:41.010]  Give him a follow.
[02:42:41.010 --> 02:42:42.170]  We'll appreciate that.
[02:42:42.170 --> 02:42:44.330]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes.
[02:42:44.330 --> 02:42:46.570]  Go to the iTunes store, search for iGrow Culture,
[02:42:46.570 --> 02:42:49.410]  find the review section and give me a five-star rating.
[02:42:49.410 --> 02:42:50.530]  After that, type in a comment
[02:42:50.530 --> 02:42:51.570]  and let me know what you think of the show
[02:42:51.570 --> 02:42:54.330]  and I will read your comments on a future episode.
[02:42:54.330 --> 02:42:56.050]  I'll also read all the Stitcher comments.
[02:42:56.050 --> 02:42:57.530]  Stitcher just recently updated
[02:42:58.290 --> 02:43:00.330]  and it is a lot easier for me to find the comments.
[02:43:00.330 --> 02:43:02.090]  So go to Stitcher, leave your comments there,
[02:43:02.090 --> 02:43:03.490]  give me a five-star review
[02:43:03.490 --> 02:43:06.090]  and I will read your comments from Stitcher as well.
[02:43:06.090 --> 02:43:07.850]  The reason I like good reviews and good ratings
[02:43:07.850 --> 02:43:09.570]  is because that helps us move up in the ranks,
[02:43:09.570 --> 02:43:13.290]  which gets us seen by more listeners,
[02:43:13.290 --> 02:43:15.450]  which gets more people growing quality product,
[02:43:15.450 --> 02:43:18.050]  which gets less shit product out on the street.
[02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:20.490]  So we can improve everybody's garden
[02:43:20.490 --> 02:43:23.330]  by making the podcast a little more popular.
[02:43:23.330 --> 02:43:25.970]  Don't forget that the show is available on iTunes, Stitcher
[02:43:26.010 --> 02:43:28.410]  and every single episode is archived
[02:43:28.410 --> 02:43:30.850]  on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[02:43:32.130 --> 02:43:34.530]  I wanna give a big, huge shout out to my ninja Spence.
[02:43:34.530 --> 02:43:36.770]  I owe a huge shout out to my buddy, Doug Benson.
[02:43:36.770 --> 02:43:38.810]  Shout out to the crew at Comedy Works.
[02:43:38.810 --> 02:43:40.210]  Thanks again for listening, you guys.
[02:43:40.210 --> 02:43:42.810]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[02:44:08.410 --> 02:44:10.130]  Yeah, what's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:44:10.130 --> 02:44:14.410]  Welcome to episode number 31 of the iGrow Culture podcast.
[02:44:14.410 --> 02:44:16.090]  You know who it is, it's your host Rasta Jeff.
[02:44:16.090 --> 02:44:17.330]  Glad to be back with you.

[02:46:40.190 --> 02:46:41.230]  Taking big fat dabs
[02:46:41.230 --> 02:46:43.030]  and I don't have anything to drink next to me.
[02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:44.630]  It's kind of a fatal mistake.
[02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:47.630]  I owe a big fat shout out to my man TaskRock.
[02:46:47.630 --> 02:46:49.510]  TaskRock hooked me up with this blue,
[02:46:49.510 --> 02:46:51.750]  highly educated carb cap.
[02:46:52.990 --> 02:46:55.990]  Helps out a lot, lets you get those low temp dabs.
[02:46:56.630 --> 02:46:57.470]  I also wanna give him a shout out
[02:46:57.470 --> 02:46:58.550]  for this nail I've got on my rig.
[02:46:58.550 --> 02:47:01.270]  That is a highly educated duality nail.
[02:47:01.270 --> 02:47:02.270]  It's one of my favorite nails.
[02:47:02.270 --> 02:47:03.750]  It's what I use the most.
[02:47:03.750 --> 02:47:04.830]  We're not sponsored by Hitman,
[02:47:04.830 --> 02:47:06.470]  but this Hitman rig right here,
[02:47:06.470 --> 02:47:08.070]  that's probably the rig I grabbed first
[02:47:08.070 --> 02:47:09.470]  when it's time to take dabs.
[02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:11.630]  Also sit next to me,
[02:47:11.630 --> 02:47:13.950]  I got a backup plan in case it gets dirty.
[02:47:13.950 --> 02:47:15.190]  I got the Mad Rob.
[02:47:15.190 --> 02:47:16.350]  Big shout out to Mad Rob.
[02:47:16.350 --> 02:47:19.110]  Support Mad Rob Glass, support Hitman Glass.
[02:47:19.110 --> 02:47:21.190]  I don't have any specific glass sponsors,
[02:47:21.190 --> 02:47:23.090]  so I can say all their brand names.
[02:47:24.670 --> 02:47:25.790]  Big shout out to Solomon.
[02:47:26.550 --> 02:47:27.390]  Solomon made me a,
[02:47:27.390 --> 02:47:28.710]  I still remember when I said that S.
[02:47:28.710 --> 02:47:30.350]  Solomon made me a great Rasta colored rig,
[02:47:30.350 --> 02:47:31.990]  I really dig that.
[02:47:31.990 --> 02:47:33.630]  All right guys, I'm gonna turn down the music.
[02:47:33.630 --> 02:47:36.030]  It looks like the music is gonna fade out itself.
[02:47:36.030 --> 02:47:38.350]  We'll make sure we don't play any more songs.
[02:47:38.350 --> 02:47:40.470]  Need to give a big shout out to the Mystic Roots Band.
[02:47:40.470 --> 02:47:42.070]  What you're listening to is the doggy dub
[02:47:42.070 --> 02:47:44.190]  from the album Constant Struggle.
[02:47:44.190 --> 02:47:47.010]  Big huge shout out to Coot Dog and Catherine.
[02:47:48.230 --> 02:47:50.470]  Some of the coolest people in reggae.
[02:47:50.470 --> 02:47:51.630]  All right, let's get down to business.
[02:47:51.630 --> 02:47:53.550]  I'm gonna fade this out.
[02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:55.190]  Fade that out, no more music.
[02:47:55.510 --> 02:47:57.430]  It makes it so much easier for me to think and do a show
[02:47:57.430 --> 02:47:59.210]  when there is no music going on.
[02:48:00.790 --> 02:48:02.710]  That dab worked y'all.
[02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:05.590]  All right, so I told you I had a lot of good news going on.
[02:48:05.590 --> 02:48:07.430]  If I can get my web browser to open,
[02:48:07.430 --> 02:48:09.430]  I will read the great news for the day.
[02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:14.070]  It says, realm of caring announces
[02:48:14.070 --> 02:48:17.370]  Charlotte's web to be shipped to all 50 US states.
[02:48:18.350 --> 02:48:20.190]  Now, what the fuck?
[02:48:21.170 --> 02:48:22.310]  Oh man, I owe a dollar.
[02:48:22.310 --> 02:48:23.750]  What the heck?
[02:48:23.750 --> 02:48:24.570]  That's a dollar.
[02:48:24.910 --> 02:48:25.750]  Somebody tweet me and remind me
[02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:27.490]  that I owe another dollar to that charity.
[02:48:27.490 --> 02:48:29.690]  Realm of caring announces Charlotte's web
[02:48:29.690 --> 02:48:31.690]  to be shipped to all 50 US states.
[02:48:31.690 --> 02:48:34.790]  Charlotte's web is a kind of popular strain of cannabis
[02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:36.730]  that's really high in CBD.
[02:48:36.730 --> 02:48:39.090]  And they're going to ship it to all 50 states?
[02:48:39.090 --> 02:48:41.790]  That already makes you raise your eyebrows and say WTF?
[02:48:42.890 --> 02:48:44.850]  So I'm gonna try to quit coughing.
[02:48:44.850 --> 02:48:47.690]  Oh look, I have a Gatorade down here that I've spaced out.
[02:48:48.970 --> 02:48:51.570]  Let me take a sip of this, because dude, I'm choking.
[02:48:57.380 --> 02:48:59.660]  All right, so families of realm of caring's
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:01.820]  out of state wait list received emails this week
[02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:04.660]  that Charlotte's web hemp oil will now be available
[02:49:04.660 --> 02:49:07.780]  for shipping to all 50 states.
[02:49:07.780 --> 02:49:09.500]  Something I find weird here.
[02:49:09.500 --> 02:49:10.660]  I'm gonna have to do more research.
[02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:12.460]  It says Charlotte's web hemp oil,
[02:49:12.460 --> 02:49:14.780]  and it's got the little trademark symbol right above that.
[02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:18.540]  So they've trademarked Charlotte's web hemp oil.
[02:49:18.540 --> 02:49:20.100]  The email from realm of caring,
[02:49:20.100 --> 02:49:21.940]  which will now be referred to as ROC,
[02:49:21.940 --> 02:49:24.460]  explains that Charlotte's web product they will be shipping
[02:49:24.460 --> 02:49:26.900]  falls within the federally acceptable limit
[02:49:27.740 --> 02:49:30.740]  of less than 0.3% of THC for classification
[02:49:30.740 --> 02:49:32.700]  as a hemp derived food product.
[02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:36.620]  The email also states that the legality of this product
[02:49:36.620 --> 02:49:39.700]  is still ambiguous and recommends the patient sign up
[02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:41.980]  for their state's medical marijuana programs
[02:49:41.980 --> 02:49:43.980]  to provide your family more protection.
[02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:47.100]  However, the organization will ship to patients
[02:49:47.100 --> 02:49:48.460]  who have signed up for the wait list,
[02:49:48.460 --> 02:49:51.380]  regardless of their home state's cannabis policies,
[02:49:51.380 --> 02:49:53.900]  and regardless of each individual client's status
[02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:57.940]  as a licensed medical cannabis patient.
[02:49:57.940 --> 02:49:59.980]  So they found a loophole.
[02:49:59.980 --> 02:50:03.900]  Apparently there is less than 0.3% THC
[02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:06.940]  in the Charlotte's web cannabis oil that they're making.
[02:50:07.900 --> 02:50:08.820]  Let me call it the right thing,
[02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:09.660]  because they've trademarked it.
[02:50:09.660 --> 02:50:10.500]  We've got to say it right.
[02:50:10.500 --> 02:50:12.020]  I got to scroll back up.
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:13.260]  Where the hell did it go?
[02:50:14.860 --> 02:50:16.140]  Oh, Charlotte's web hemp oil.
[02:50:16.140 --> 02:50:17.220]  It's right there in the very first sentence.
[02:50:17.220 --> 02:50:19.180]  I scrolled down way too far.
[02:50:19.180 --> 02:50:22.620]  So they're gonna ship it to all 50 states.
[02:50:22.620 --> 02:50:24.860]  That means people in Massachusetts.
[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:26.180]  Pick a state that you're afraid of.
[02:50:26.180 --> 02:50:27.980]  If you live in a state right now
[02:50:27.980 --> 02:50:29.700]  and cannabis is not legal there,
[02:50:30.540 --> 02:50:33.620]  you can get this product shipped to you
[02:50:33.620 --> 02:50:34.780]  if you were on their waiting list.
[02:50:34.780 --> 02:50:36.220]  I don't know how long ago you had to sign up
[02:50:36.220 --> 02:50:38.180]  to get on the waiting list, but if you were there,
[02:50:38.180 --> 02:50:40.300]  you can get this product now.
[02:50:40.300 --> 02:50:41.820]  I find that remarkable.
[02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:43.020]  I find that quite ballsy.
[02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:44.780]  Ballsy is the word I'm gonna use.
[02:50:44.780 --> 02:50:46.140]  I find it really compassionate,
[02:50:46.140 --> 02:50:47.380]  and I really hope this works out.
[02:50:47.380 --> 02:50:48.980]  I hope this helps a lot of people.
[02:50:48.980 --> 02:50:50.460]  I'm gonna continue with the article.
[02:50:50.460 --> 02:50:52.100]  Let me give some credit before I get too far.
[02:50:52.500 --> 02:50:55.060]  I forgot to give credit to where this article came from.
[02:50:57.860 --> 02:51:00.540]  It just says photo by, let's see.
[02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:02.580]  I guess it's by Vanessa Waltz Medical.
[02:51:02.580 --> 02:51:05.820]  Yes, Vanessa Waltz Medical News and Editorial.
[02:51:08.220 --> 02:51:09.100]  All right, sorry, I should have prepared
[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:10.620]  a little better for that part.
[02:51:12.340 --> 02:51:15.140]  So yeah, it gives photo credit to Vanessa Waltz,
[02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:17.020]  and I'm pretty sure that the article is from her also.
[02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:20.460]  I actually, this was tweeted to me by my friend on Twitter.
[02:51:20.460 --> 02:51:21.300]  What's up, White Mike?
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:22.620]  Thanks for tweeting that.
[02:51:22.620 --> 02:51:24.860]  He's Nikon and Nemopunk on Twitter.
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:26.100]  I'm not sure which is which.
[02:51:26.100 --> 02:51:27.860]  It's either at Nikon or at Nemopunk.
[02:51:27.860 --> 02:51:30.620]  Here, let's just be diligent and go look at that for you.
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:32.060]  And then I promise I'll get back into the article.
[02:51:32.060 --> 02:51:32.900]  I just wanna give Mike credit,
[02:51:32.900 --> 02:51:33.780]  because he hooked me up here.
[02:51:33.780 --> 02:51:36.020]  This was really something I was glad to see,
[02:51:36.020 --> 02:51:39.340]  because we see all kinds of bad news all the time, right?
[02:51:39.340 --> 02:51:41.780]  It's good to see some great shit I'm going through
[02:51:41.780 --> 02:51:43.500]  as quick as I can on Twitter.
[02:51:43.500 --> 02:51:47.100]  So it's Nikon, N-I-C-O-N, but he is at Nemopunk15,
[02:51:47.100 --> 02:51:49.900]  at N-E-M-O-P-U-N-K-15.
[02:51:49.900 --> 02:51:50.940]  So give him a shout out for me.
[02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:53.100]  Tell him that you appreciate hearing his story
[02:51:53.100 --> 02:51:55.340]  that he sent me on the news here.
[02:51:55.340 --> 02:51:57.740]  All right, I'm gonna scroll back down.
[02:51:57.740 --> 02:52:00.620]  The cost of the oil will be $250 per bottle,
[02:52:00.620 --> 02:52:05.620]  which is equal to five cents per milligram of CBD.
[02:52:06.100 --> 02:52:08.900]  So there are pros and cons of the new development
[02:52:08.900 --> 02:52:11.340]  and an explanation of why it's likely to be quite different
[02:52:11.340 --> 02:52:14.500]  than the R-S-H-O CBD debacle.
[02:52:14.500 --> 02:52:17.340]  We're gonna have to, that's got a link to it.
[02:52:17.340 --> 02:52:22.340]  So we're gonna check out the R-S-H-O CBD debacle.
[02:52:22.380 --> 02:52:24.620]  We're gonna read that link also.
[02:52:24.620 --> 02:52:27.580]  Open link in new tab and open link in new tab.
[02:52:27.580 --> 02:52:29.220]  I wonder if that's the same thing.
[02:52:31.660 --> 02:52:32.540]  We're gonna read those also.
[02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:34.980]  Sorry guys, I'm rambling because I took a couple of dabs
[02:52:34.980 --> 02:52:36.620]  and I just wanted to get this news out.
[02:52:36.620 --> 02:52:38.220]  Mike sent me this and I just wanted to get on the mic
[02:52:38.220 --> 02:52:39.540]  and read it.
[02:52:39.540 --> 02:52:42.700]  So according to ROC, the oil will test
[02:52:42.700 --> 02:52:44.580]  at a consistent 30 to one ratio,
[02:52:44.620 --> 02:52:47.460]  and the THC will be lower than the 0.3% allowed
[02:52:47.460 --> 02:52:49.740]  for food products under federal law.
[02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:54.580]  While naysayers may question why this is any more legal
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:57.580]  than R-S-H-O's products, it is critical to remember
[02:52:57.580 --> 02:52:59.980]  that R-S-H-O has been tested numerous times
[02:52:59.980 --> 02:53:03.020]  by independent laboratories, finding contents in excess
[02:53:03.020 --> 02:53:07.900]  of 1% THC, which is undeniably illegal under federal law
[02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:09.900]  and in non-medical states.
[02:53:09.900 --> 02:53:12.500]  We can only hope that ROC's testing and quality control
[02:53:12.540 --> 02:53:14.860]  will be far more reliable than R-S-H-O's
[02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:17.340]  based on ROC's established track record
[02:53:17.340 --> 02:53:21.500]  with products already available in Colorado and California.
[02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:22.820]  This is likely to be the case,
[02:53:22.820 --> 02:53:25.860]  although maintaining a consistent ratio of 30 to one
[02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:29.220]  will undoubtedly be challenging for the company's growers
[02:53:29.220 --> 02:53:30.940]  and extraction staff.
[02:53:30.940 --> 02:53:33.940]  So guys, I've been seeing a lot of initials here, this R-S-H-O.
[02:53:33.940 --> 02:53:36.060]  Let's go see what that is.
[02:53:37.540 --> 02:53:39.900]  R-S-H-O, not a normal reaction to cannabis.
[02:53:39.900 --> 02:53:43.420]  So this is a product that shows a bottle.
[02:53:43.420 --> 02:53:47.780]  It looks like nature supplement.
[02:53:47.780 --> 02:53:50.660]  There's some in a syringe, like an oral syringe,
[02:53:50.660 --> 02:53:53.580]  and then there's some in a bottle, it's 18% CBD.
[02:53:55.500 --> 02:53:57.260]  And I'm gonna read just this little quick article
[02:53:57.260 --> 02:53:59.500]  that comes from, I'll give you some credit, who wrote it.
[02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:02.180]  It looks like another Vanessa Waltz article.
[02:54:02.180 --> 02:54:05.340]  In the wake of reports of serious gastrointestinal effects
[02:54:05.340 --> 02:54:07.660]  from the real scientific hemp oil,
[02:54:07.660 --> 02:54:10.100]  real scientific hemp oil.
[02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:13.500]  So it's a controversial product,
[02:54:13.500 --> 02:54:16.460]  and people are claiming nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.
[02:54:16.460 --> 02:54:17.900]  People are saying that's a normal effect.
[02:54:17.900 --> 02:54:19.140]  So I don't know anything about that.
[02:54:19.140 --> 02:54:21.220]  I can't argue that from taking this product,
[02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:23.380]  from saying if that's a good effect or not.
[02:54:26.100 --> 02:54:27.580]  Okay, it's just another competing product.
[02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:29.340]  We're just gonna go back to the article.
[02:54:29.340 --> 02:54:30.780]  I just wanted to make sure we knew what that was.
[02:54:30.780 --> 02:54:34.060]  Also, I said the CBD debacle.
[02:54:34.060 --> 02:54:35.100]  I clicked that link.
[02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:36.100]  Let's see what that's about.
[02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:39.980]  Go figure, it's another Vanessa Waltz article.
[02:54:43.130 --> 02:54:45.450]  That's just another article about marketing CBD.
[02:54:45.450 --> 02:54:47.050]  So we're gonna see a lot of that stuff
[02:54:47.050 --> 02:54:48.810]  because it's gonna get really, really popular,
[02:54:48.810 --> 02:54:51.970]  or it is getting really, really popular, apparently.
[02:54:51.970 --> 02:54:53.250]  I'll continue with the article.
[02:54:53.250 --> 02:54:55.530]  As far as the feds coming down with ROC,
[02:54:57.730 --> 02:55:00.170]  oh, as far as the feds coming down on ROC,
[02:55:00.170 --> 02:55:01.810]  with a question mark, that's actually a question,
[02:55:01.810 --> 02:55:03.450]  so we're supposed to say it like,
[02:55:03.450 --> 02:55:05.650]  as far as the feds coming down on ROC,
[02:55:06.570 --> 02:55:08.250]  that would be an extremely poor PR move
[02:55:08.250 --> 02:55:09.850]  on the federal government's part.
[02:55:09.850 --> 02:55:12.690]  With all the hype generated by Sanjay Gupta's CNN specials
[02:55:12.690 --> 02:55:14.730]  and the widespread media coverage on CBD,
[02:55:14.730 --> 02:55:16.370]  a federal crackdown on Charlotte's Web
[02:55:16.370 --> 02:55:19.650]  would cause a huge uproar, and the feds surely know this.
[02:55:19.650 --> 02:55:21.570]  Arresting and prosecuting the self-proclaimed
[02:55:21.570 --> 02:55:23.690]  Christian CBD providers from ROC
[02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:25.970]  would spur an entirely different public response
[02:55:25.970 --> 02:55:29.330]  than the arrest and prosecution of RSHO's leaders,
[02:55:29.330 --> 02:55:31.370]  many of whom have already faced charges
[02:55:31.370 --> 02:55:34.090]  from the SEC and other federal agencies.
[02:55:34.090 --> 02:55:37.370]  My guess is that ROC is essentially untouchable
[02:55:37.370 --> 02:55:39.650]  and unimpeachable in this venture.
[02:55:42.170 --> 02:55:45.050]  As for the negative side, the most basic and critical flaw
[02:55:45.050 --> 02:55:46.850]  is that 30 to one oil is unlikely
[02:55:46.850 --> 02:55:48.450]  to help most epileptic children.
[02:55:48.450 --> 02:55:50.570]  Anecdotal reports from Colorado families
[02:55:50.570 --> 02:55:52.850]  using the higher ratio of Charlotte's Web,
[02:55:52.850 --> 02:55:57.050]  which is reportedly tested as high as 48 to one CBD to THC,
[02:55:57.050 --> 02:55:59.330]  indicate that their children are either switching
[02:55:59.330 --> 02:56:01.730]  to other products to maintain seizure control
[02:56:01.730 --> 02:56:04.490]  or supplementing Charlotte's Web with higher THC products
[02:56:04.490 --> 02:56:07.490]  available through Colorado's medical cannabis program.
[02:56:07.490 --> 02:56:08.970]  This THC supplementation,
[02:56:08.970 --> 02:56:11.090]  in addition to mail-order Charlotte's Web,
[02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:13.610]  is a viable option for children in other medical states
[02:56:13.610 --> 02:56:16.290]  who have previously been unable to find consistent sources
[02:56:16.290 --> 02:56:19.050]  of clean, well-tested CBD products.
[02:56:19.050 --> 02:56:20.210]  And in non-medical states,
[02:56:20.210 --> 02:56:23.610]  it is certainly easier to find THC for supplementation
[02:56:23.610 --> 02:56:25.050]  in the underground black market
[02:56:25.050 --> 02:56:28.250]  than it is to find CBD oils or clones.
[02:56:28.250 --> 02:56:30.410]  So, yeah, I was thinking about that
[02:56:30.410 --> 02:56:31.770]  the whole time I was reading this.
[02:56:31.770 --> 02:56:34.170]  It's just CBD.
[02:56:34.170 --> 02:56:35.450]  What about that entourage effect
[02:56:35.450 --> 02:56:36.810]  we've talked about so many times?
[02:56:36.810 --> 02:56:42.610]  We got to get that whole myriad of CBD, THC, THC-V.
[02:56:42.610 --> 02:56:45.450]  What about the terpenoids that we're missing?
[02:56:45.450 --> 02:56:47.410]  I think all of it does it together.
[02:56:47.410 --> 02:56:49.290]  And they're saying that they're actually trying,
[02:56:49.290 --> 02:56:51.970]  they're needing to supplement with some higher THC products
[02:56:51.970 --> 02:56:54.810]  because the CBD is not working completely.
[02:56:54.810 --> 02:56:55.610]  It's probably helping.
[02:56:55.610 --> 02:56:59.530]  It's, you know, just like any medication that you would take
[02:56:59.530 --> 02:57:02.210]  or anything new you would introduce to your body,
[02:57:02.210 --> 02:57:04.370]  the first few times you consume or take that,
[02:57:04.370 --> 02:57:06.250]  you're going to notice a stronger reaction.
[02:57:06.250 --> 02:57:09.010]  And after anything, a few times, a few times,
[02:57:09.010 --> 02:57:11.770]  you're going to quit feeling as strong of an effect.
[02:57:11.770 --> 02:57:15.970]  So I'm pretty sure that this CBD does work,
[02:57:15.970 --> 02:57:18.330]  you know, for a while, maybe for a long time for some people,
[02:57:18.330 --> 02:57:19.370]  maybe forever for some.
[02:57:19.370 --> 02:57:22.210]  But some people, you're going to need that THC.
[02:57:22.210 --> 02:57:24.130]  I think I've repeated and rambled about that long enough.
[02:57:24.130 --> 02:57:27.210]  So let me wrap up the last paragraph here.
[02:57:27.210 --> 02:57:29.090]  In short, there should be a positive step
[02:57:29.090 --> 02:57:30.490]  in the war on cannabis.
[02:57:30.490 --> 02:57:33.130]  At the very least, it should force federal opinion
[02:57:33.130 --> 02:57:35.530]  on the legality of CBD hemp products.
[02:57:35.530 --> 02:57:37.450]  It will likely benefit some number of patients,
[02:57:37.450 --> 02:57:40.530]  especially those who were able to supplement with THC.
[02:57:40.530 --> 02:57:42.530]  And unlike the CBD only legislation
[02:57:42.530 --> 02:57:45.330]  that has been pushed by ROC,
[02:57:45.330 --> 02:57:47.090]  the shipping of Charlotte's Web is unlikely
[02:57:47.090 --> 02:57:48.810]  to have a negative impact
[02:57:48.810 --> 02:57:51.010]  on future whole plant legislation.
[02:57:51.010 --> 02:57:52.650]  While the concept of trademarking a plant
[02:57:52.650 --> 02:57:55.130]  and hoarding a strain still rubs many patients
[02:57:55.130 --> 02:57:57.490]  and industry insiders the wrong way.
[02:57:57.490 --> 02:57:59.410]  The bottom line is that more patients
[02:57:59.410 --> 02:58:01.570]  will soon be able to access CBD rich oil
[02:58:01.570 --> 02:58:04.650]  without having to move to realm of caring states.
[02:58:04.650 --> 02:58:05.850]  And that's a good thing.
[02:58:06.970 --> 02:58:08.490]  This lady seems to know what she's talking about.
[02:58:08.490 --> 02:58:10.050]  I want to, if you guys want somebody
[02:58:10.050 --> 02:58:11.170]  to follow Kool on Twitter,
[02:58:11.170 --> 02:58:12.130]  I don't know if she has a Twitter account,
[02:58:12.130 --> 02:58:12.970]  let's read about it.
[02:58:12.970 --> 02:58:15.170]  There's a little article about Vanessa Waltz.
[02:58:15.170 --> 02:58:16.530]  Vanessa Waltz is a writer, artist,
[02:58:16.530 --> 02:58:18.890]  and marijuana reform advocate living in New Mexico.
[02:58:18.890 --> 02:58:20.050]  She graduated, okay.
[02:58:21.250 --> 02:58:22.490]  Check her out, dude, Vanessa Waltz.
[02:58:22.490 --> 02:58:24.410]  She seems to have a good head on her shoulders
[02:58:24.410 --> 02:58:26.290]  when it comes to marijuana, cannabis.
[02:58:27.290 --> 02:58:28.130]  That's one thing we got to do.
[02:58:28.130 --> 02:58:29.130]  We got to quit saying marijuana
[02:58:29.130 --> 02:58:30.170]  and say cannabis all the time.
[02:58:30.170 --> 02:58:31.490]  I just kept reading the word marijuana
[02:58:31.490 --> 02:58:32.650]  and now it's in my head.
[02:58:34.290 --> 02:58:39.290]  So, yeah, one brand only,
[02:58:40.050 --> 02:58:42.410]  Charlotte's Web, they're hoarding this strain.
[02:58:42.410 --> 02:58:45.050]  If you've got Charlotte's Web or high CBD medicine,
[02:58:45.050 --> 02:58:47.090]  share that stuff, get that out there.
[02:58:47.090 --> 02:58:48.170]  Grow clones of that.
[02:58:48.170 --> 02:58:51.130]  If you live in a legal state, cut a lot of clones.
[02:58:51.130 --> 02:58:53.810]  Whenever you cut clones, get to your plant count,
[02:58:53.850 --> 02:58:57.050]  cut that many clones, give those out.
[02:58:57.050 --> 02:58:58.290]  If you have extras, you know what I'm saying?
[02:58:58.290 --> 02:59:00.490]  Sorry, I'm making too many thoughts at once right now,
[02:59:00.490 --> 02:59:02.410]  trying to do a show and ramble.
[02:59:02.410 --> 02:59:05.410]  So if you've got clones of CBD medicine,
[02:59:05.410 --> 02:59:06.810]  put those out there, that's what I'm saying,
[02:59:06.810 --> 02:59:08.210]  because we don't want these companies
[02:59:08.210 --> 02:59:09.450]  taking over all that shit.
[02:59:09.450 --> 02:59:12.010]  Why do we want a company in charge of that?
[02:59:12.010 --> 02:59:13.130]  That doesn't seem,
[02:59:14.450 --> 02:59:17.290]  that's why most of us are smoking medical cannabis anyway,
[02:59:17.290 --> 02:59:19.650]  is because we don't want a company getting rich off of us
[02:59:19.650 --> 02:59:23.290]  or a company telling us what we can and cannot consume.
[02:59:23.330 --> 02:59:24.730]  So I'm gonna move on to the next article
[02:59:24.730 --> 02:59:27.290]  because I feel like I'm ranting, super dabbed out.
[02:59:27.290 --> 02:59:29.290]  I gotta quit getting so high on these episodes.
[02:59:29.290 --> 02:59:31.290]  It's kind of fun to tell you the truth.
[02:59:31.290 --> 02:59:34.010]  It's my show and I'll get high if I want to.
[02:59:34.010 --> 02:59:35.410]  This article, remember a little while back,
[02:59:35.410 --> 02:59:38.410]  we talked about a police officer
[02:59:38.410 --> 02:59:41.410]  who gave out a whole bunch of tickets,
[02:59:41.410 --> 02:59:44.770]  66 citations in Seattle.
[02:59:44.770 --> 02:59:47.090]  He was the main guy giving out all the pot tickets.
[02:59:47.090 --> 02:59:48.770]  We gave him the big middle finger.
[02:59:49.970 --> 02:59:52.810]  Here's another article that came from Seattle.
[02:59:52.810 --> 02:59:54.650]  Credit goes to the Associated Press.
[02:59:54.650 --> 02:59:57.610]  It says, Seattle's police chief has asked the city
[02:59:57.610 --> 03:00:00.090]  to seek dismissal of all marijuana citations
[03:00:00.090 --> 03:00:02.050]  issued by the bicycle officer
[03:00:02.050 --> 03:00:04.050]  who wrote 80% of the tickets handed out
[03:00:04.050 --> 03:00:07.290]  during the first half of this year for using pot in public.
[03:00:08.770 --> 03:00:11.570]  Seattle Times reports that Chief Kathleen O'Toole
[03:00:11.570 --> 03:00:13.850]  said Friday the request to the city attorney's office
[03:00:13.850 --> 03:00:16.730]  stems from a conclusion that the 66 citations
[03:00:16.730 --> 03:00:19.690]  were written as part of the officer's personal agenda.
[03:00:19.690 --> 03:00:22.850]  O'Toole says the tickets were written for the wrong reason.
[03:00:22.850 --> 03:00:27.850]  Bicycle officer wrote 66 of the 83 such tickets
[03:00:27.890 --> 03:00:30.210]  issued in the first half of the year of the city.
[03:00:30.210 --> 03:00:34.170]  This dude wrote 66 of 83 tickets
[03:00:34.170 --> 03:00:35.410]  in the first half of the year.
[03:00:35.410 --> 03:00:38.370]  So in six months, every month this dude busted,
[03:00:38.370 --> 03:00:40.750]  wrote 11 tickets for people smoking pot.
[03:00:42.970 --> 03:00:45.610]  The officer wrote on one citation that he used a coin toss
[03:00:45.610 --> 03:00:48.410]  to decide which of two men got the ticket
[03:00:48.410 --> 03:00:52.050]  and on another described state voter approval
[03:00:52.050 --> 03:00:54.590]  of marijuana legalization as silly.
[03:00:55.490 --> 03:00:58.930]  What he freaking, he wrote on the citation
[03:00:58.930 --> 03:01:03.050]  that he used a coin to decide which two guys got the ticket.
[03:01:03.050 --> 03:01:04.850]  How can cops get away with that?
[03:01:04.850 --> 03:01:05.970]  He wrote it on the ticket.
[03:01:05.970 --> 03:01:07.330]  I guess he's not.
[03:01:07.330 --> 03:01:09.370]  They're trying to make him not count now.
[03:01:09.370 --> 03:01:11.810]  They're trying to say, ha ha, your tickets don't count.
[03:01:11.810 --> 03:01:12.970]  Wouldn't that be a big middle finger
[03:01:12.970 --> 03:01:14.410]  if the authorities gave the authority
[03:01:14.410 --> 03:01:15.570]  a big middle finger like that?
[03:01:15.570 --> 03:01:16.490]  I like it.
[03:01:16.570 --> 03:01:19.410]  The Times says the officer has apologized to O'Toole.
[03:01:19.410 --> 03:01:22.370]  She is reportedly still considering disciplinary action.
[03:01:23.570 --> 03:01:25.930]  The city attorney Pete Holmes spokeswoman, Kimberly Mills,
[03:01:25.930 --> 03:01:28.530]  says Holmes will review the chief's request.
[03:01:28.530 --> 03:01:30.890]  Initiative 502 approved by Washington voters
[03:01:30.890 --> 03:01:34.090]  included a civil fine for public consumption of marijuana.
[03:01:35.490 --> 03:01:38.970]  So we kind of got some people on our side
[03:01:38.970 --> 03:01:41.210]  because they let that cop,
[03:01:41.210 --> 03:01:43.050]  they may let that cop's tickets slide.
[03:01:43.050 --> 03:01:43.890]  That'll be kind of neat.
[03:01:43.890 --> 03:01:45.890]  I'm scrolling through to the next article.
[03:01:47.490 --> 03:01:49.610]  They were talking about in Denver
[03:01:49.610 --> 03:01:52.010]  about banning BHO extraction
[03:01:52.010 --> 03:01:54.690]  and banning certain types of extractions
[03:01:54.690 --> 03:01:57.650]  without being in a licensed facility
[03:01:57.650 --> 03:01:59.170]  or what they would call a MIPS.
[03:01:59.170 --> 03:02:02.130]  I think that is to be a little more accurate.
[03:02:02.130 --> 03:02:03.570]  Sorry, I'm checking too many things on the computer.
[03:02:03.570 --> 03:02:05.650]  The video is going, the recording is going,
[03:02:05.650 --> 03:02:07.170]  and I'm on the right website.
[03:02:07.170 --> 03:02:09.090]  Dude, we are golden tonight.
[03:02:09.090 --> 03:02:10.690]  For as many dabs as we took,
[03:02:10.690 --> 03:02:13.210]  this is working out pretty well.
[03:02:13.210 --> 03:02:15.410]  All right, so this says some exemptions
[03:02:15.490 --> 03:02:18.810]  and proposed Denver restrictions on making home hash oil.
[03:02:19.890 --> 03:02:23.010]  So it says alcohol-based extraction process
[03:02:23.010 --> 03:02:25.530]  would join water and food-based methods
[03:02:25.530 --> 03:02:27.970]  as acceptable in Denver City Council Committee's
[03:02:27.970 --> 03:02:29.170]  planned ordinance.
[03:02:30.570 --> 03:02:33.250]  This article is by John Murray from the Denver Post.
[03:02:33.250 --> 03:02:35.730]  It says Denver City Council Committee Tuesday
[03:02:35.730 --> 03:02:38.930]  delayed proposed restrictions on home hash oil production
[03:02:38.930 --> 03:02:41.730]  so that they could be amended to accommodate residents
[03:02:41.730 --> 03:02:44.730]  who use an alcohol-based process.
[03:02:44.730 --> 03:02:46.530]  Sorry, shit's falling over on the table here.
[03:02:46.530 --> 03:02:49.290]  Not even sure what's happened, and that was weird.
[03:02:49.290 --> 03:02:50.770]  Several people argued for the change
[03:02:50.770 --> 03:02:53.010]  to the Safety and Wellbeing Committee,
[03:02:53.010 --> 03:02:54.490]  including the father of a little girl
[03:02:54.490 --> 03:02:57.890]  who depends on cannabis oil to treat her severe epilepsy.
[03:02:57.890 --> 03:02:59.810]  The committee will resume the discussion
[03:02:59.810 --> 03:03:03.490]  on the proposed ordinance or could vote October 16th
[03:03:03.490 --> 03:03:06.810]  on whether to send it to the full council.
[03:03:06.810 --> 03:03:09.650]  The proposal would ban the amateur use of butane
[03:03:09.650 --> 03:03:13.490]  or other gases in extractions of oil-formed marijuana.
[03:03:13.490 --> 03:03:16.250]  That's resulted in dozens of home explosions
[03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:17.770]  statewide this year.
[03:03:17.770 --> 03:03:20.490]  Licensed businesses still could use that process,
[03:03:20.490 --> 03:03:22.610]  but people who make hash oil at home
[03:03:22.610 --> 03:03:26.430]  would have to use safe water and food-based methods.
[03:03:29.330 --> 03:03:31.810]  This is gonna have two different effects.
[03:03:33.490 --> 03:03:36.850]  Well, people do shit that's illegal anyway,
[03:03:36.850 --> 03:03:39.090]  so I don't think that people are gonna stop doing it.
[03:03:39.090 --> 03:03:40.730]  It's just gonna make it a little sketchier,
[03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:41.930]  and now that's gonna cause
[03:03:43.490 --> 03:03:45.210]  more people sneaking around doing it,
[03:03:45.210 --> 03:03:47.330]  and you have to do it in a little more sketchy place,
[03:03:47.330 --> 03:03:49.010]  which means you're a little more enclosed,
[03:03:49.010 --> 03:03:50.850]  which is the dangerous part of it.
[03:03:50.850 --> 03:03:53.290]  And also, I think it's gonna make
[03:03:53.290 --> 03:03:56.530]  the street value of BHO dabs go up,
[03:03:56.530 --> 03:03:57.530]  and already right now,
[03:03:57.530 --> 03:03:59.370]  dabs are getting kind of hard to find around here,
[03:03:59.370 --> 03:04:01.410]  and the prices are going up really high,
[03:04:01.410 --> 03:04:04.050]  and it's because they're making rules like this.
[03:04:04.050 --> 03:04:07.890]  I agree, I don't want some uneducated dude next door
[03:04:07.890 --> 03:04:09.570]  in his garage making hash
[03:04:09.570 --> 03:04:11.330]  while I'm sitting here trying to record a podcast.
[03:04:11.330 --> 03:04:13.050]  I don't need the next door house blowing up
[03:04:13.050 --> 03:04:14.770]  and screwing up all of our lives.
[03:04:14.770 --> 03:04:16.850]  So I guess it's kind of,
[03:04:18.610 --> 03:04:20.610]  the adult in me, the parent in me,
[03:04:20.610 --> 03:04:22.570]  the freaking smart guy says
[03:04:22.570 --> 03:04:24.690]  we should not be blasting like that,
[03:04:24.690 --> 03:04:27.170]  so that's kind of cool, dude,
[03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:30.170]  but then we gotta get the shops,
[03:04:30.170 --> 03:04:32.010]  or we gotta figure out a way
[03:04:32.010 --> 03:04:34.690]  that we can get some kind of private caregivers
[03:04:34.690 --> 03:04:35.970]  to be able to blast it.
[03:04:35.970 --> 03:04:37.650]  If we build our own rooms,
[03:04:38.530 --> 03:04:41.690]  if I have OSHA come and build me a blast safe room,
[03:04:41.690 --> 03:04:44.530]  can I make it in there then maybe, please?
[03:04:44.530 --> 03:04:46.050]  You know, there has to be some kind of exception
[03:04:46.050 --> 03:04:49.410]  because the shops are charging way too much right now
[03:04:49.410 --> 03:04:52.810]  for shatter, and a lot of it is shit, to tell you the truth.
[03:04:52.810 --> 03:04:54.090]  I wouldn't dab a lot of the hash
[03:04:54.090 --> 03:04:55.930]  that I've seen come from the shops.
[03:04:55.930 --> 03:04:58.450]  I am a little bit of a hash nub, to tell you the truth,
[03:04:58.450 --> 03:05:01.170]  but I don't wanna dab a lot of that shit.
[03:05:01.170 --> 03:05:02.570]  So here, let me show you.
[03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:03.930]  I've got a camera going here.
[03:05:03.930 --> 03:05:05.410]  Guys, I'll post some pictures of this.
[03:05:05.410 --> 03:05:08.210]  I'm kind of working on putting up YouTube videos.
[03:05:08.210 --> 03:05:09.450]  This got hot.
[03:05:09.450 --> 03:05:10.290]  I can't see what I'm doing.
[03:05:10.290 --> 03:05:11.130]  Let me switch to the video.
[03:05:11.130 --> 03:05:13.010]  This got hot in the car,
[03:05:13.010 --> 03:05:16.130]  but this is some Golden Goat Shatter right here.
[03:05:17.370 --> 03:05:18.650]  It should be nice and stable.
[03:05:18.650 --> 03:05:20.810]  It shouldn't be goopy, soupy, and poopy.
[03:05:23.130 --> 03:05:24.410]  And then I'm gonna contradict myself
[03:05:24.410 --> 03:05:27.210]  by showing you some live resin that is a little bit gooey,
[03:05:27.210 --> 03:05:28.410]  but this is a different product.
[03:05:28.410 --> 03:05:29.490]  This isn't shatter.
[03:05:29.490 --> 03:05:31.170]  We're not marketing this as shatter.
[03:05:31.170 --> 03:05:32.930]  This is live resin.
[03:05:33.450 --> 03:05:37.530]  It's, see how golden and clear that is, brah?
[03:05:37.530 --> 03:05:39.890]  That's just, we've talked about live resin.
[03:05:39.890 --> 03:05:41.770]  It's fresh, frozen, butane-blasted,
[03:05:41.770 --> 03:05:43.410]  bud-stunned in a closed loop.
[03:05:43.410 --> 03:05:44.650]  Shout out to the guy that did it for me.
[03:05:44.650 --> 03:05:45.490]  He knows what's up.
[03:05:45.490 --> 03:05:46.330]  He knows who he is.
[03:05:46.330 --> 03:05:48.330]  I don't know if I should say his name on the show right now.
[03:05:48.330 --> 03:05:49.170]  Good work.
[03:05:49.170 --> 03:05:50.890]  That shit's golden, really golden-looking.
[03:05:51.770 --> 03:05:53.730]  But the shops are charging too much for doo-doo,
[03:05:53.730 --> 03:05:54.570]  and that sucks.
[03:05:54.570 --> 03:05:56.570]  So they have to let the artists,
[03:05:56.570 --> 03:05:58.290]  the extract artists that know what they're doing,
[03:05:58.290 --> 03:06:01.130]  the people that kind of led this movement,
[03:06:01.170 --> 03:06:03.210]  the guys that make everything happen.
[03:06:03.210 --> 03:06:04.050]  Not everything, that'll make,
[03:06:04.050 --> 03:06:06.370]  sorry, I'm adjusting a camera over here while I'm rambling.
[03:06:06.370 --> 03:06:09.170]  The guys that have evolved all this hash stuff,
[03:06:09.170 --> 03:06:11.010]  they've done the research, they've done the work.
[03:06:11.010 --> 03:06:13.290]  We need to be able to do it in a safe manner.
[03:06:13.290 --> 03:06:15.850]  And I know that open blasting is not a safe manner.
[03:06:17.490 --> 03:06:19.450]  I wonder if this is, let's see,
[03:06:19.450 --> 03:06:20.930]  is this gonna have anything to do with the guys
[03:06:20.930 --> 03:06:22.290]  with the closed loop system?
[03:06:23.130 --> 03:06:24.650]  I'm gonna scroll through this article one quick time
[03:06:24.650 --> 03:06:29.330]  and see, would ban amateur use of propane or other gases
[03:06:29.330 --> 03:06:31.010]  and extraction of oil from, yeah,
[03:06:31.890 --> 03:06:33.410]  if that fucking says closed loop system or not,
[03:06:33.410 --> 03:06:35.250]  I think, in the way that that's worded.
[03:06:35.250 --> 03:06:37.130]  So we're gonna have to be careful,
[03:06:37.130 --> 03:06:38.450]  because I know a few guys that have invested
[03:06:38.450 --> 03:06:39.330]  in a closed loop system,
[03:06:39.330 --> 03:06:40.690]  thinking that that would solve the problem.
[03:06:40.690 --> 03:06:43.490]  And now look, they're changing the rules right around you.
[03:06:43.490 --> 03:06:44.650]  All right, I'm gonna get back into the article.
[03:06:44.650 --> 03:06:45.770]  It says, Brian Wilson,
[03:06:45.770 --> 03:06:47.610]  whose family moved from New Jersey to Denver
[03:06:47.610 --> 03:06:50.010]  earlier this year, so his three-year-old daughter, Vivian,
[03:06:50.010 --> 03:06:51.730]  could use medical marijuana treatments,
[03:06:51.730 --> 03:06:53.370]  said neither of those methods will produce
[03:06:53.370 --> 03:06:55.170]  the kind of oil suitable for her.
[03:06:55.170 --> 03:06:58.050]  He uses an ethanol-based extraction process.
[03:06:59.130 --> 03:07:00.850]  I didn't move I here to put her at more risk,
[03:07:01.690 --> 03:07:02.530]  said Brian Wilson said.
[03:07:02.530 --> 03:07:05.930]  Denver Fire Chief Eric Tade, excuse me,
[03:07:05.930 --> 03:07:08.090]  told the committee that the proposal likely
[03:07:08.090 --> 03:07:11.490]  could be amended to allow alcohol-based methods
[03:07:11.490 --> 03:07:14.330]  with limits on use of heat and amount of alcohol
[03:07:14.330 --> 03:07:16.170]  to keep it safe.
[03:07:16.170 --> 03:07:19.290]  See, I guess if, man, I don't like rules and stuff,
[03:07:19.290 --> 03:07:21.090]  but I don't like fires and explosions either.
[03:07:21.090 --> 03:07:24.450]  If I have a choice, a couple of rules or a couple of fires,
[03:07:24.450 --> 03:07:27.290]  and the Rastafari in me says, fuck the rules,
[03:07:27.290 --> 03:07:28.170]  I owe a dollar.
[03:07:28.210 --> 03:07:32.530]  But the other part of me says, I don't like fire.
[03:07:32.530 --> 03:07:34.250]  Let me explain why I keep saying that I need a dollar
[03:07:34.250 --> 03:07:36.970]  if you're not a common listener,
[03:07:36.970 --> 03:07:39.890]  what's a regular listener, what's the phrase for that?
[03:07:39.890 --> 03:07:41.490]  A regular listener, I guess.
[03:07:44.050 --> 03:07:46.650]  Every time I say the F word, I owe a dollar.
[03:07:46.650 --> 03:07:48.010]  And there's a charity, there's a guy,
[03:07:48.010 --> 03:07:49.890]  he's not a charity, it's a sick person,
[03:07:49.890 --> 03:07:51.450]  sick child that will get my dollars.
[03:07:51.450 --> 03:07:53.490]  Every time I say the F word, you guys have to tweet me,
[03:07:53.490 --> 03:07:54.370]  tell me when I said it,
[03:07:54.370 --> 03:07:57.610]  tell me how many times in this episode I said it.
[03:07:58.050 --> 03:07:59.290]  It starts on episode 30, this is 31,
[03:07:59.290 --> 03:08:00.530]  so you got two episodes where you can make
[03:08:00.530 --> 03:08:01.450]  some money off me.
[03:08:02.690 --> 03:08:04.930]  After a couple episodes, if I don't stop saying the F word,
[03:08:04.930 --> 03:08:06.450]  I'm gonna increase the dollar amount.
[03:08:06.450 --> 03:08:08.570]  I'll go from a dollar, then I'll be like,
[03:08:08.570 --> 03:08:10.570]  all right, now I'm gonna, not now, I'm not saying this,
[03:08:10.570 --> 03:08:11.930]  but hypothetically in the future,
[03:08:11.930 --> 03:08:13.610]  I'll start charging myself $5
[03:08:13.610 --> 03:08:15.210]  for every time I say the F word.
[03:08:16.130 --> 03:08:18.050]  And then if I still don't stop, I'll charge 10 bucks,
[03:08:18.050 --> 03:08:19.970]  and then it's gonna start costing me money,
[03:08:19.970 --> 03:08:21.970]  and money counts, and I don't wanna say the F word
[03:08:21.970 --> 03:08:23.450]  on the show, and I don't wanna pay money,
[03:08:23.450 --> 03:08:24.650]  so it's gonna work together.
[03:08:24.650 --> 03:08:25.930]  I'm rambling tonight, guys,
[03:08:25.970 --> 03:08:27.970]  that's why I got behind the mic.
[03:08:27.970 --> 03:08:30.770]  I got this cool news about people sending CBD oil.
[03:08:30.770 --> 03:08:34.290]  I want your comments about the CBD oil story, tweet me that.
[03:08:35.610 --> 03:08:36.970]  I'm gonna take a drink right quick, you guys,
[03:08:36.970 --> 03:08:39.970]  give me a second, I'm not even gonna edit this part.
[03:08:48.540 --> 03:08:49.500]  All right.
[03:08:52.100 --> 03:08:54.740]  Okay, this article, I said I had good news,
[03:08:54.740 --> 03:08:58.700]  this one isn't the greatest of news, but it's news.
[03:08:59.540 --> 03:09:01.980]  It says, it's from the Denver Post,
[03:09:01.980 --> 03:09:03.900]  it doesn't give a reporter a name.
[03:09:05.300 --> 03:09:06.500]  Nope.
[03:09:06.500 --> 03:09:08.420]  It says, seven people are now named as plaintiffs
[03:09:08.420 --> 03:09:10.780]  in a class action lawsuit against the company accused
[03:09:10.780 --> 03:09:13.220]  on giving people samples of marijuana-laced chocolate
[03:09:13.220 --> 03:09:15.620]  at the Denver County Fair's Pot Pavilion,
[03:09:15.620 --> 03:09:18.620]  which was supposed to be drug-free.
[03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:21.660]  The suit, filed August 25th in Denver District Court
[03:09:21.660 --> 03:09:26.660]  by law firm Frescona, Joiner, Goodman, and Greenstein,
[03:09:27.620 --> 03:09:30.540]  alleges, that first name was a stumble, sorry,
[03:09:30.540 --> 03:09:33.540]  alleges that representatives of Beyond Broadway LLC,
[03:09:33.540 --> 03:09:37.620]  doing business as both Full Melt Chocolate and Live Well,
[03:09:37.620 --> 03:09:40.900]  handed out the chocolate on August 1st through 3rd.
[03:09:40.900 --> 03:09:43.580]  The suit is open to all people served THC chocolates
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:45.620]  by Beyond Broadway LLC at the fair.
[03:09:46.540 --> 03:09:51.540]  Oh man, so we talked about this a little while back.
[03:09:51.620 --> 03:09:54.700]  There was a Pot Pavilion at the Denver County Fair.
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:09:56.140]  They had a joint rolling contest
[03:09:56.660 --> 03:09:59.580]  where actually they rolled oregano instead of rolling pot,
[03:09:59.580 --> 03:10:00.900]  but they had a joint rolling contest.
[03:10:00.900 --> 03:10:01.860]  They had a lot of stuff going on.
[03:10:01.860 --> 03:10:04.660]  They actually had a pot growing competition offsite
[03:10:04.660 --> 03:10:05.820]  where people had to grow their pot
[03:10:05.820 --> 03:10:07.420]  and then people would go look at it somewhere else
[03:10:07.420 --> 03:10:09.140]  because they didn't want it there.
[03:10:09.140 --> 03:10:10.940]  You were not supposed to bring any pot products
[03:10:10.940 --> 03:10:12.820]  to this fair.
[03:10:12.820 --> 03:10:14.420]  That's not what was supposed to happen,
[03:10:14.420 --> 03:10:19.420]  but Full Melt handed out some chocolate bars
[03:10:19.660 --> 03:10:20.740]  and people ate them.
[03:10:21.620 --> 03:10:24.200]  And seven people are now named as plaintiffs
[03:10:24.200 --> 03:10:26.880]  in a class action lawsuit against these guys.
[03:10:29.680 --> 03:10:32.400]  Imagine, and we had this talk a little while back
[03:10:32.400 --> 03:10:35.840]  on the show, but imagine if you were not a pot smoker.
[03:10:35.840 --> 03:10:38.760]  Some of you listening to this show may not be pot smokers.
[03:10:38.760 --> 03:10:40.560]  Some of you may be amateur pot smokers.
[03:10:40.560 --> 03:10:42.700]  Some of you I know only have smoked a little while.
[03:10:42.700 --> 03:10:45.340]  Some of you can only smoke very occasionally.
[03:10:46.520 --> 03:10:50.120]  And if you eat 100 milligram edible,
[03:10:50.120 --> 03:10:52.100]  you're going to get really high.
[03:10:52.100 --> 03:10:53.860]  So imagine if you went to the fair
[03:10:55.180 --> 03:10:56.940]  and you're just hanging out and someone's like,
[03:10:56.940 --> 03:10:58.300]  you want to try this chocolate man?
[03:10:58.300 --> 03:10:59.140]  And you're like, does it have weed in it?
[03:10:59.140 --> 03:11:00.980]  And they're like, no.
[03:11:00.980 --> 03:11:02.300]  And you're like, I believe you.
[03:11:02.300 --> 03:11:04.620]  You work for this company and you've got the apron on
[03:11:04.620 --> 03:11:07.060]  that says the company and you're behind the booth.
[03:11:07.060 --> 03:11:07.900]  I believe you.
[03:11:07.900 --> 03:11:09.860]  So you eat the chocolate, right?
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:12.460]  Probably 45 minutes later, you're just shit in your pants
[03:11:12.460 --> 03:11:13.620]  because you're too high.
[03:11:13.620 --> 03:11:14.840]  Oh man, imagine that.
[03:11:14.840 --> 03:11:16.620]  You got to try to drive home.
[03:11:16.620 --> 03:11:18.180]  And the weird part of the head trip of it,
[03:11:18.180 --> 03:11:21.500]  in my opinion, is you don't realize that you ate something
[03:11:21.940 --> 03:11:23.260]  that was going to make you feel intoxicated.
[03:11:23.260 --> 03:11:25.700]  So now you're like tripping a little bit
[03:11:25.700 --> 03:11:27.020]  because you're high, right?
[03:11:27.020 --> 03:11:28.340]  You're starting to feel whatever,
[03:11:28.340 --> 03:11:29.900]  whatever comes on first,
[03:11:29.900 --> 03:11:31.900]  you get the tingles in your arms
[03:11:31.900 --> 03:11:33.220]  and then things are a little funny
[03:11:33.220 --> 03:11:35.860]  and you start giggling, but you don't know why.
[03:11:35.860 --> 03:11:37.980]  And, but now you really don't know why
[03:11:37.980 --> 03:11:39.660]  because you didn't realize you ate the shit.
[03:11:39.660 --> 03:11:41.340]  So you're like, I'm retarded now.
[03:11:41.340 --> 03:11:43.240]  You think you just fucking, your brain is flipping out.
[03:11:43.240 --> 03:11:45.700]  I own another dollar, get me on it.
[03:11:45.700 --> 03:11:47.380]  Hey, shout out to dreadful J.
[03:11:47.380 --> 03:11:48.300]  What's up mama?
[03:11:48.300 --> 03:11:49.980]  You remind me every time I say the F word
[03:11:49.980 --> 03:11:51.480]  and I appreciate it.
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:53.160]  Keep those Instagram pictures coming.
[03:11:53.160 --> 03:11:54.920]  Guys follow dreadful J on Instagram.
[03:11:54.920 --> 03:11:56.000]  She's a bad-ass woman.
[03:11:56.000 --> 03:11:57.140]  She makes some good hash.
[03:11:57.140 --> 03:11:58.360]  She's an awesome lady.
[03:11:58.360 --> 03:11:59.200]  Check her out.
[03:12:00.120 --> 03:12:02.880]  But imagine you'd just be tripping, dude.
[03:12:02.880 --> 03:12:04.540]  You'd just be, and you'd have to,
[03:12:04.540 --> 03:12:05.460]  what if you had your kids with you?
[03:12:05.460 --> 03:12:06.720]  What if you were with your mom?
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:08.000]  What if you have a job?
[03:12:08.000 --> 03:12:10.660]  Oh, what if you have a job, dude?
[03:12:10.660 --> 03:12:12.320]  Or they drug test you?
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:15.000]  What if you were a reporter that was on the clock?
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:17.840]  See, this could have caused a lot of problems.
[03:12:17.840 --> 03:12:18.800]  We shouldn't talk too much about it
[03:12:18.800 --> 03:12:19.800]  because I guess there's a court case
[03:12:19.800 --> 03:12:20.760]  and somebody could hear what I'm saying
[03:12:21.080 --> 03:12:21.920]  and be like, yeah, that is fucked up.
[03:12:21.920 --> 03:12:22.960]  I didn't realize that.
[03:12:22.960 --> 03:12:24.780]  I owe another goddamn dollar.
[03:12:24.780 --> 03:12:26.680]  This is gonna be an expensive episode.
[03:12:27.680 --> 03:12:29.680]  So seven people are gonna make a lot of money
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:32.200]  off of Full Metal Chocolate and Live Well.
[03:12:33.000 --> 03:12:36.920]  And so be careful if you ever go to a fair or an event
[03:12:36.920 --> 03:12:38.440]  and they're handing out cannabis chocolates
[03:12:38.440 --> 03:12:40.300]  and you're a lightweight or you're not aware
[03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:42.760]  of what you're getting as carefully.
[03:12:42.760 --> 03:12:44.100]  And then I guess if you get the wrong shit,
[03:12:44.100 --> 03:12:45.360]  sue the hell out of them.
[03:12:46.240 --> 03:12:48.240]  I probably wouldn't if, I wouldn't if you did it to me,
[03:12:48.240 --> 03:12:50.840]  but if you gave my daughter a medicated chocolate
[03:12:50.840 --> 03:12:52.480]  and told her that it was a regular chocolate,
[03:12:52.480 --> 03:12:54.440]  that's, I'm definitely, you're gonna, yeah,
[03:12:54.440 --> 03:12:55.880]  there's gonna be at least a court case.
[03:12:55.880 --> 03:12:59.360]  It might be against me for me reacting to that shit,
[03:12:59.360 --> 03:13:01.320]  but hopefully I can maintain and we'll do it properly
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:03.520]  and just sue the shit out of you.
[03:13:03.520 --> 03:13:05.600]  Oh, guys, I've been rambling for, let's see,
[03:13:05.600 --> 03:13:06.440]  let's go look at a clock,
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:07.440]  see how long I've been going on
[03:13:07.440 --> 03:13:09.320]  because I might have to pee here.
[03:13:09.320 --> 03:13:11.520]  Oh, dude, it's coming right up on 30 minutes.
[03:13:11.520 --> 03:13:12.480]  So I'm gonna fade out.
[03:13:12.480 --> 03:13:14.480]  We'll be back and we'll do another segment right after this.
[03:13:14.480 --> 03:13:17.320]  I'm gonna dab and use the little boy's room.
[03:13:17.320 --> 03:13:19.840]  Thanks for listening to me ramble a lot tonight, guys.
[03:13:19.840 --> 03:13:21.960]  Video watchers, I don't know what I'm gonna do
[03:13:21.960 --> 03:13:22.800]  for this part.
[03:13:22.800 --> 03:13:23.640]  I'll just keep the video rolling
[03:13:23.640 --> 03:13:26.000]  and we'll figure it out in a minute.
[03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:27.000]  All right, guys, I am back.
[03:13:27.000 --> 03:13:28.960]  While I was gone, I turned on the email
[03:13:28.960 --> 03:13:30.480]  and I grabbed myself a bottle of water.
[03:13:30.480 --> 03:13:32.800]  So I think I'm gonna survive.
[03:13:32.800 --> 03:13:36.680]  Speaking of the email, let's take a big fat hit out of this.
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:39.440]  I'm using my blue, highly educated carb cap.
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:40.400]  I need to clean this thing.
[03:13:40.400 --> 03:13:42.440]  Guys, keep your carb cap clean.
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:44.120]  It will help you out a lot.
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:46.440]  Dropping it onto the infinity nail
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:49.640]  with an email wrapped around it off of an old school rig
[03:13:49.640 --> 03:13:50.480]  that I like this one
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:52.240]  because it's sturdy enough to hold up the email.
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:53.080]  That's why I use this one.
[03:13:53.080 --> 03:13:54.200]  So here we go.
[03:13:54.200 --> 03:13:55.080]  Big fat dab.
[03:13:55.080 --> 03:13:55.920]  Let's do it.
[03:13:57.000 --> 03:13:58.040]  It's not really a big fat dab.
[03:13:58.040 --> 03:13:59.000]  I just need to be able to talk.
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:00.640]  So I do a little one on the show.
[03:14:26.670 --> 03:14:28.190]  All right, that'll do it.
[03:14:28.190 --> 03:14:30.030]  I noticed that dab.
[03:14:34.510 --> 03:14:36.110]  All right, so I've mentioned a couple of times
[03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:38.790]  that I'm doing a video on this episode.
[03:14:38.790 --> 03:14:41.990]  I'm trying to go through all of the old episodes
[03:14:41.990 --> 03:14:44.390]  and just make really cheesy iMovie videos
[03:14:44.390 --> 03:14:45.990]  so that they can be up on YouTube
[03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:48.150]  so that people that don't have an iPhone
[03:14:48.150 --> 03:14:49.350]  or don't have Stitcher or whatever
[03:14:49.350 --> 03:14:52.990]  who are more simple and more familiar with the YouTube,
[03:14:52.990 --> 03:14:55.430]  well, it'll just give us another way to be listened.
[03:14:55.430 --> 03:14:56.790]  So I'm gonna go throw the show up on YouTube.
[03:14:56.790 --> 03:14:59.070]  There'll be really simple videos at first.
[03:14:59.070 --> 03:15:02.190]  I'll learn how to make better videos as time goes by.
[03:15:02.510 --> 03:15:04.790]  The first few will be cheesy, I promise you.
[03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:06.070]  The first two are goofy.
[03:15:06.070 --> 03:15:07.950]  I made them last night.
[03:15:07.950 --> 03:15:09.150]  Might've been medicated.
[03:15:10.310 --> 03:15:12.710]  Might've been really medicated.
[03:15:12.710 --> 03:15:14.190]  I've been taking dabs of this golden goat
[03:15:14.190 --> 03:15:16.910]  and you can't sleep after you dab this golden goat.
[03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:18.790]  So you just gotta open your computer and just go nuts
[03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:20.390]  because you don't really wanna do anything important
[03:15:20.390 --> 03:15:21.590]  when you're that dabbed.
[03:15:23.350 --> 03:15:24.790]  So I'm recording this one.
[03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:26.070]  I'm just staring into my MacBook
[03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:28.550]  with the camera going and just recording me.
[03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:29.390]  What's up?
[03:15:29.390 --> 03:15:31.470]  If you're checking it out right now.
[03:15:31.470 --> 03:15:33.110]  I may just post that to YouTube,
[03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:35.110]  but you got 30 episodes to figure that one out.
[03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:38.430]  So it'll be up there eventually.
[03:15:38.430 --> 03:15:39.830]  I might go out of order.
[03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:41.510]  You never know with us.
[03:15:41.510 --> 03:15:42.750]  You never know with me.
[03:15:42.750 --> 03:15:43.990]  I just wanted to jump on here and record
[03:15:43.990 --> 03:15:45.630]  because I got that really cool tweet
[03:15:45.630 --> 03:15:47.550]  about that article that Mike sent me.
[03:15:47.550 --> 03:15:48.870]  Had to tell you about that.
[03:15:48.870 --> 03:15:51.070]  I wanted to talk about the video.
[03:15:51.070 --> 03:15:53.110]  Of course I am the guy from iRegeneticSeeds.
[03:15:53.110 --> 03:15:55.310]  A lot of people have been asking me
[03:15:55.310 --> 03:15:57.470]  when will certain things be back in stock
[03:15:57.470 --> 03:15:58.830]  at Nature's Green Remedies?
[03:15:59.670 --> 03:16:01.950]  They're sold out because I'm sold out.
[03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:04.670]  You guys cleaned me the heck out of seeds.
[03:16:05.590 --> 03:16:06.470]  I really appreciate it.
[03:16:06.470 --> 03:16:08.470]  I promise you I'm working on more stuff.
[03:16:10.270 --> 03:16:12.590]  I've got more Grateful Dog.
[03:16:12.590 --> 03:16:14.630]  There'll be a little bit of Grateful Dog.
[03:16:15.590 --> 03:16:17.750]  That one doesn't make a lot of seeds.
[03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:18.990]  It's harder to get seeds out of that one
[03:16:18.990 --> 03:16:20.110]  than a lot of the others.
[03:16:20.110 --> 03:16:21.230]  There'll be a lot of Bounty Killer.
[03:16:21.230 --> 03:16:23.230]  There'll be a lot of Capleton.
[03:16:23.230 --> 03:16:25.310]  There'll be a little bit of Heart of Gold.
[03:16:25.310 --> 03:16:26.870]  There will be some Kalonji.
[03:16:26.870 --> 03:16:29.030]  There may be a little bit of Night Nurse.
[03:16:30.390 --> 03:16:32.950]  A lot of what I make goes to the people around here
[03:16:32.950 --> 03:16:35.430]  before it makes it to Nature's Green Remedies.
[03:16:35.430 --> 03:16:38.070]  It goes to other places before it gets there.
[03:16:38.070 --> 03:16:40.310]  I take care of the locals first.
[03:16:40.310 --> 03:16:42.150]  I take care of the people around me, my patients.
[03:16:42.150 --> 03:16:42.990]  I'm a caregiver.
[03:16:42.990 --> 03:16:45.110]  Those guys get the seeds first that I make.
[03:16:45.110 --> 03:16:46.990]  And then I put what I have on Nature's Green Remedies
[03:16:46.990 --> 03:16:48.430]  when they order from me.
[03:16:48.430 --> 03:16:51.430]  So I let them know when I have stuff, they'll order it.
[03:16:51.430 --> 03:16:53.630]  And then they'll put it on the website, guys.
[03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:57.990]  It's going to be honestly, I'm coughing and counting.
[03:16:57.990 --> 03:17:02.990]  So we're looking about probably 75 to 90 days-ish.
[03:17:04.470 --> 03:17:06.390]  I don't want to make any huge promises.
[03:17:06.390 --> 03:17:08.550]  And there should be some stuff on Nature's Green Remedies,
[03:17:08.550 --> 03:17:10.070]  maybe a hundred days.
[03:17:10.070 --> 03:17:12.030]  I'm going to say, because I need packaging time
[03:17:12.030 --> 03:17:13.590]  and all that stuff, drying time.
[03:17:14.670 --> 03:17:15.630]  Right around a hundred days,
[03:17:15.630 --> 03:17:17.910]  there should be some stuff available from iRegenetics,
[03:17:17.910 --> 03:17:20.750]  again, at naturesgreenremedies.com.
[03:17:20.750 --> 03:17:23.190]  I apologize for not being able to keep them in stock.
[03:17:23.790 --> 03:17:24.950]  Honestly, it's kind of a good sign that they're sold out.
[03:17:24.950 --> 03:17:27.310]  That means I'd be doing shit right.
[03:17:28.270 --> 03:17:30.070]  Also, I have a forum.
[03:17:30.070 --> 03:17:33.150]  iRegeneticscolorado.com has a forum.
[03:17:33.150 --> 03:17:35.110]  If you go to iRegeneticscolorado.com,
[03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:37.390]  you can check out our genetics.
[03:17:37.390 --> 03:17:38.990]  It is a work in progress.
[03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.830]  I don't run the website.
[03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:40.670]  It's my buddy, Tony.
[03:17:40.670 --> 03:17:42.270]  He's a college student.
[03:17:42.270 --> 03:17:43.110]  He's a working man.
[03:17:43.110 --> 03:17:45.430]  So we put together the website late at night
[03:17:45.430 --> 03:17:47.070]  when we're chilling out.
[03:17:47.070 --> 03:17:48.430]  So check it out.
[03:17:48.430 --> 03:17:49.270]  Please support that.
[03:17:49.270 --> 03:17:50.110]  Join the forum.
[03:17:50.110 --> 03:17:52.630]  If you have questions, we will answer your questions.
[03:17:53.110 --> 03:17:55.590]  Some of the stuff from the show comes from the forum
[03:17:55.590 --> 03:17:57.670]  and some of the stuff from the show goes onto the forum.
[03:17:57.670 --> 03:17:59.710]  So it's kind of a little way to be interactive
[03:17:59.710 --> 03:18:01.390]  if you guys want to participate.
[03:18:01.390 --> 03:18:03.230]  Also, speaking of participation,
[03:18:03.230 --> 03:18:04.070]  you can follow us.
[03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:05.510]  Please follow us.
[03:18:05.510 --> 03:18:09.270]  Follow iGrowCulture on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter.
[03:18:09.270 --> 03:18:11.830]  And also follow iRegenetics on Facebook,
[03:18:11.830 --> 03:18:12.950]  Instagram, and Twitter.
[03:18:12.950 --> 03:18:14.030]  That'd be really cool.
[03:18:16.030 --> 03:18:17.110]  Coming up in the future,
[03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:18.910]  I know we said that we were going to do an episode
[03:18:18.910 --> 03:18:20.550]  about curing your cannabis.
[03:18:21.510 --> 03:18:23.350]  That's definitely going to happen.
[03:18:23.350 --> 03:18:24.630]  Jesse and I are working on that.
[03:18:24.630 --> 03:18:27.390]  We want to put together better episodes for you guys
[03:18:27.390 --> 03:18:29.950]  who are taking our time and going slow.
[03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:32.150]  This may just be like a midweek booster episode.
[03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:33.830]  Just kind of me hanging out dabbing.
[03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:35.310]  I was eager to get a show out.
[03:18:36.590 --> 03:18:38.670]  Man, I don't have a lot else to say.
[03:18:38.670 --> 03:18:40.550]  I got to give a couple of shout outs.
[03:18:40.550 --> 03:18:44.630]  Shout out to Ku and Kat and the entire Mystic Roots band.
[03:18:44.630 --> 03:18:46.950]  Make sure you check out the Mystic Roots band.
[03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:51.070]  Big shout out to Task Rock and Highly Educated Titanium.
[03:18:51.070 --> 03:18:54.190]  Big super shout out to the entire Garden of Weeden crew.
[03:18:54.190 --> 03:18:55.310]  Big shout out to Jesse.
[03:18:55.310 --> 03:18:57.350]  Big shout out to Atmis Green Thumb.
[03:18:57.350 --> 03:18:59.630]  Also a shout out to HippieNurse710
[03:18:59.630 --> 03:19:01.230]  and a shout out to Angela.
[03:19:01.230 --> 03:19:05.070]  So I'm going to wrap up the show and we do this part.
[03:19:05.070 --> 03:19:06.950]  Now that the show is over, please go to iTunes.
[03:19:06.950 --> 03:19:07.990]  Go to the iTunes store,
[03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:10.310]  search for the iGrowCulture podcast.
[03:19:10.310 --> 03:19:11.630]  Find the review section.
[03:19:11.630 --> 03:19:13.310]  Give me a five-star rating.
[03:19:13.310 --> 03:19:14.150]  Come on.
[03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:16.390]  You know you want to give me a five-star rating.
[03:19:16.430 --> 03:19:18.830]  What that does is that knocks me up higher in the ranks.
[03:19:18.830 --> 03:19:20.150]  People see the show.
[03:19:20.150 --> 03:19:21.310]  More people listen to the show,
[03:19:21.310 --> 03:19:23.390]  which moves me up higher into the ranks.
[03:19:23.390 --> 03:19:24.270]  More people see the show.
[03:19:24.270 --> 03:19:25.430]  More people listen to the show.
[03:19:25.430 --> 03:19:28.030]  And in turn, more of your friends
[03:19:28.030 --> 03:19:29.790]  get to grow high-grade cannabis.
[03:19:29.790 --> 03:19:32.750]  More people get educated the proper way about cannabis.
[03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:36.150]  More people will quit believing bullshit about cannabis.
[03:19:36.150 --> 03:19:37.310]  More people will know the truth.
[03:19:37.310 --> 03:19:39.190]  Cannabis will be freed.
[03:19:39.190 --> 03:19:41.430]  Cannabis will be legalized everywhere.
[03:19:41.430 --> 03:19:43.590]  This is a small step for weed kind.
[03:19:43.590 --> 03:19:45.270]  I don't know what the fuck I'm saying anymore.
[03:19:45.270 --> 03:19:47.190]  Anyway, type in a little comment.
[03:19:47.190 --> 03:19:48.910]  Let me know what you think about the show.
[03:19:48.910 --> 03:19:50.150]  I'll read your comments on the show.
[03:19:50.150 --> 03:19:52.190]  It means a lot to me to know what people think.
[03:19:52.190 --> 03:19:53.030]  I say this all the time.
[03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:55.190]  If you love the show, go write a little comment.
[03:19:55.190 --> 03:19:56.190]  If you thought the show,
[03:19:56.190 --> 03:19:58.110]  if you listened for this long, you probably liked it.
[03:19:58.110 --> 03:19:59.830]  But if you thought the show was totally retarded
[03:19:59.830 --> 03:20:01.670]  and you think I'm an idiot, tell me.
[03:20:01.670 --> 03:20:03.030]  Tell me what I'm doing wrong.
[03:20:03.030 --> 03:20:03.870]  Maybe I'll correct it.
[03:20:03.870 --> 03:20:05.270]  I probably don't give two shits
[03:20:05.270 --> 03:20:07.190]  because I like the way the show goes.
[03:20:07.190 --> 03:20:08.510]  I hope you guys like it too.
[03:20:08.510 --> 03:20:10.110]  If it's little stuff that I can fix, I'll do it.
[03:20:10.110 --> 03:20:11.150]  If there's little stuff that you're like,
[03:20:11.150 --> 03:20:13.630]  dude, that is so dumb or annoying, I'll think about it.
[03:20:13.670 --> 03:20:15.950]  But if you're like, your dreadlocks are dumb,
[03:20:15.950 --> 03:20:17.950]  you already know what my answer is gonna be.
[03:20:18.950 --> 03:20:20.230]  You guys that are listening this far,
[03:20:20.230 --> 03:20:21.070]  you're not gonna say that.
[03:20:21.070 --> 03:20:22.750]  I love you guys that are following me, listening.
[03:20:22.750 --> 03:20:24.270]  I've got two different monitors I'm looking at.
[03:20:24.270 --> 03:20:25.430]  That's why it looks like I'm darting around
[03:20:25.430 --> 03:20:26.790]  and I got paper here.
[03:20:26.790 --> 03:20:27.750]  That's the first time I tried to do
[03:20:27.750 --> 03:20:30.270]  an actual thought out video.
[03:20:30.270 --> 03:20:33.950]  There's another video, maybe episode 21, that it's goofy.
[03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:36.150]  I was really uncomfortable in that one.
[03:20:36.150 --> 03:20:37.270]  Getting better at the podcasting.
[03:20:37.270 --> 03:20:38.350]  I wanna thank you guys for listening.
[03:20:38.350 --> 03:20:42.750]  I know I'm rambly, dabbed out, kinda had some caffeine.
[03:20:42.910 --> 03:20:44.950]  I got it going on today.
[03:20:44.950 --> 03:20:47.030]  So leave your comments on the show, I'll check them out.
[03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:49.190]  Stitcher updated their page.
[03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:52.150]  Oh God, excuse me, I'm burping on a podcast.
[03:20:52.150 --> 03:20:53.950]  Stitcher updated their page.
[03:20:53.950 --> 03:20:56.070]  And you can leave comments a little more easily now
[03:20:56.070 --> 03:20:57.670]  and I can find your comments more easily.
[03:20:57.670 --> 03:20:59.670]  So leave your comments on Stitcher.
[03:20:59.670 --> 03:21:00.830]  And once again, leave me the reviews
[03:21:00.830 --> 03:21:01.790]  so I move up in the ranks.
[03:21:01.790 --> 03:21:04.190]  We can legalize pot one step at a time.
[03:21:04.190 --> 03:21:05.390]  One click at a time, right?
[03:21:05.390 --> 03:21:06.950]  Well, that's our new motto here.
[03:21:06.950 --> 03:21:08.790]  Legalizing cannabis one click at a time.
[03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:09.870]  Spread that shit around the world.
[03:21:09.870 --> 03:21:12.550]  Somebody tweet me that, cause I'm gonna forget it.
[03:21:13.310 --> 03:21:14.150]  Don't forget that every episode
[03:21:14.150 --> 03:21:17.430]  is available on iRegeneticsColorado.com.
[03:21:17.430 --> 03:21:18.790]  The show's available on iTunes.
[03:21:18.790 --> 03:21:20.790]  The show's available on Stitcher.
[03:21:20.790 --> 03:21:24.510]  And I'm going to try to get all of the episodes on YouTube.
[03:21:24.510 --> 03:21:25.870]  That's a huge commitment, you guys.
[03:21:25.870 --> 03:21:27.470]  It takes a lot of chunk of time.
[03:21:28.310 --> 03:21:29.150]  I'm gonna try to do it.
[03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:30.870]  And uploading an episode to YouTube,
[03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:34.470]  it takes the computer all day to get it up there.
[03:21:34.470 --> 03:21:36.350]  So sometimes it fails after you do it.
[03:21:36.350 --> 03:21:37.910]  And that's the fun part of life.
[03:21:37.910 --> 03:21:40.390]  Anyway, I wanna give a huge shout out to my Ninja Spence.
[03:21:40.390 --> 03:21:41.870]  Thanks again for listening.
[03:21:41.910 --> 03:21:43.510]  Take a fat dab.
[03:21:43.510 --> 03:21:44.470]  Give your mom a hug for me.
[03:21:44.470 --> 03:21:46.270]  Here comes some Mystic Roots paint.
[03:21:46.270 --> 03:21:48.670]  Has a very distinct smell, okay?
[03:21:48.670 --> 03:21:50.830]  I'm gonna pass around just a little tiny bit.
[03:21:50.830 --> 03:21:52.630]  And I want you all to take a smell
[03:21:52.630 --> 03:21:56.070]  so you know when someone is smoking Marijuana near you.
[03:21:56.070 --> 03:22:19.940]  ♪ You're my magic inspiration to look at me ♪
[03:22:32.400 --> 03:23:38.600]  ♪ Let me hear you say it's your thanks and praise today ♪
[03:23:38.600 --> 03:23:39.600]  All right, Podcast World.
[03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:42.920]  That was episodes 28, 29, 30, and 31
[03:23:42.920 --> 03:23:45.000]  of what used to be known as the iGrow Culture Podcast,
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:47.040]  currently known as the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[03:23:47.040 --> 03:23:47.880]  I wanna thank everybody
[03:23:47.880 --> 03:23:50.200]  for listening to a really long episode.
[03:23:50.200 --> 03:23:52.120]  Please let me know what you think of these long episodes.
[03:23:52.120 --> 03:23:53.080]  Is it worth my time?
[03:23:53.080 --> 03:23:54.120]  Is it worth your time?
[03:23:54.120 --> 03:23:54.960]  Send me a tweet.
[03:23:54.960 --> 03:23:55.920]  Send me an email.
[03:23:55.920 --> 03:23:58.680]  Once again, it's at GFYH Podcast on the Twitter.
[03:23:58.680 --> 03:23:59.680]  If you wanna email me,
[03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:02.120]  it's growfromyourheart at hotmail.com.
[03:24:02.120 --> 03:24:05.360]  I would love to know what you think of these long episodes.
[03:24:05.360 --> 03:24:06.960]  All right, I don't wanna make this file much longer.
[03:24:06.960 --> 03:24:08.600]  I feel like I'm rambling for no reason.
[03:24:08.600 --> 03:24:09.640]  So I'm gonna get out of here.
[03:24:09.640 --> 03:24:11.600]  I will be back Monday with a brand new episode
[03:24:11.600 --> 03:24:12.880]  with brand new content.
[03:24:13.720 --> 03:24:14.560]  I look forward to joining you.
[03:24:14.560 --> 03:24:15.400]  I hope you're there.
[03:24:15.400 --> 03:24:17.080]  Until next time, take a fat dab
[03:24:17.080 --> 03:24:18.680]  and give your mama a hug for me.
