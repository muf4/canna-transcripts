[00:00.320 --> 00:05.640]  Welcome to the show, Podcast World. It's time for episode 361 of the Grow From Your Heart
[00:05.640 --> 00:10.920]  Podcast. This episode is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:10.920 --> 00:15.720]  If you need new seeds for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company, and
[00:15.720 --> 00:22.120]  you can find them at dankseed.store. You guys know I like to start the show off by letting
[00:22.120 --> 00:26.760]  you know what I'm smoking. Today, I tried to kill our friend White Mike with a nice
[00:26.760 --> 00:33.080]  array of dabs. I think we just hit the orange Skittles Ambrosia from Apothecary. How are
[00:33.080 --> 00:34.880]  you doing, Mike? I'm still tasting that one.
[00:34.880 --> 00:37.480]  How are you doing over there, bro? I'm feeling the burn.
[00:37.480 --> 00:42.360]  Feeling the burn. It's nice and cold, but you're nice and sweaty over there, bro.
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.720]  Yeah, that last dab's got me cooking. Yeah, it's probably 30 degrees outside, and
[00:46.720 --> 00:52.360]  I am sweaty too. I took a dab of this orange Skittles Ambrosia, and my body temperature
[00:52.360 --> 00:57.680]  just went up super fast. I felt it start in my toes, my feet got sweaty, and then
[00:57.680 --> 01:03.040]  my armpits got sweaty, and then my forehead got a little sweaty. Mike just keeps saying,
[01:03.040 --> 01:06.760]  yep, and nodding his head. I think we tried to give Mike a collapse. You can go ahead
[01:06.760 --> 01:09.600]  and cough into the mic, bro. That's kind of part of the vibe of the show. You can cough
[01:09.600 --> 01:12.720]  on this one. You guys, this is not going to be a grow lesson.
[01:12.720 --> 01:14.920]  I'm getting good coughs right now. Let me put you back up a little bit.
[01:14.920 --> 01:17.480]  Welcome to the show, everybody. Mike's back. I think Mike is coming out of
[01:17.480 --> 01:21.080]  his dab coma there. You guys, this is not going to be one of the grow lessons that we
[01:21.080 --> 01:25.600]  do. We are going to talk about Canada. This episode will come out either the day or the
[01:25.600 --> 01:30.960]  day after Canada enters the world of legalization. Welcome to the club, Canada.
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.640]  Welcome to the club, Canada. In some ways, bro, they kind of did it better
[01:34.640 --> 01:38.040]  than us. They're definitely going bigger.
[01:38.040 --> 01:42.160]  They're going bigger, that is for sure. Some of their rules are better. Some of their laws
[01:42.160 --> 01:46.560]  are better. Some of their opportunities are better.
[01:46.560 --> 01:53.200]  They had a lot of other people blaze the trail for them.
[01:53.200 --> 01:58.320]  There were several delegations that came to Colorado over the years leading up to this,
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.800]  looking at different rules we had implemented, other states had implemented, and seeing how
[02:02.800 --> 02:06.120]  they played out in practice before they went ahead with their law.
[02:06.120 --> 02:09.920]  I think they're doing it right. Most of what they're doing makes sense to me. Let's talk
[02:09.920 --> 02:13.640]  more about what we've been dabbing on, bro. We went kind of quickly over that.
[02:13.640 --> 02:18.200]  That was a tease, folks. We've still got a pile of hash to talk about.
[02:18.200 --> 02:21.160]  We started off with some ... I think we started with the star dog.
[02:21.160 --> 02:23.680]  My lips are sticking together. I took some of the ...
[02:23.680 --> 02:26.720]  It's so good. I'll talk into the microphone. I took some
[02:26.720 --> 02:30.720]  of the fatso batter that I talk about, that garlic scented one, and I dunked that into
[02:30.720 --> 02:35.240]  the star dog terpenes. That gave me a head punch.
[02:35.240 --> 02:38.560]  That was intense. That was my first dab in like a week and a half.
[02:38.560 --> 02:41.680]  Welcome back. That's how we started the day.
[02:41.720 --> 02:48.000]  Then we followed that up with the Mochi Gelato, another Apothecary Farms product.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.560]  The smell coming off that one just out of the jar is something that speaks to my soul.
[02:52.560 --> 02:57.760]  I described it much differently than Mike did. I kind of said that it smelled like the
[02:57.760 --> 03:03.320]  aroma of Girl Scout cookies, plus like a toasted marshmallow sort of aroma. Mike had a much
[03:03.320 --> 03:08.400]  more unique description. I thought it was ... It reminds me of ... If
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.480]  you've ever had to change the string on your weed whacker, the head of your weed whacker,
[03:12.480 --> 03:18.160]  that oil and green plant kind of smell mixed together, but not real fuel-y.
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.440]  That just doesn't sound pleasant to me. It's an odd odor, but it's really pleasant in hash.
[03:25.440 --> 03:26.960]  I don't know. All right.
[03:26.960 --> 03:28.560]  I really liked it. As long as you like it,
[03:29.440 --> 03:34.320]  or I guess as long as you have some sort of opinion, I guess. Shit, do what you like.
[03:34.320 --> 03:35.840]  The hash has been delicious today.
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.800]  Then we followed that up with the orange Skittles, Ambrosia Skittles with a Z.
[03:42.160 --> 03:45.280]  This one, when they showed me the jar, I was like, can I have some of that?
[03:45.280 --> 03:48.160]  He's like, do you want this jar? I was like, I want that jar.
[03:48.160 --> 03:49.360]  It just coats your teeth.
[03:50.000 --> 03:50.800]  Oh, yeah.
[03:50.800 --> 03:54.320]  Like my teeth and lips are just sticky from it.
[03:54.320 --> 03:58.400]  It makes your lips sticky. It makes your teeth sticky, but I think it tastes ... I talk about
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.440]  the Clementine a lot. The Clementine's got a sweet, sugary orange kind of a thing.
[04:03.680 --> 04:06.880]  This is just straight oranges, not the sweet part.
[04:06.880 --> 04:09.840]  This is just the straight citrusy punch. Where are you going, Mike?
[04:09.840 --> 04:15.760]  I'm fucking cooked. You're holding the jar and you're talking about it and I just went to smell
[04:15.760 --> 04:17.520]  it, but I leaned in and tried to sniff the microphone.
[04:17.520 --> 04:18.320]  I saw you do something weird.
[04:18.320 --> 04:20.000]  I'm glad the cover is clean.
[04:20.000 --> 04:20.560]  What was going on?
[04:20.560 --> 04:23.760]  But yeah, my baked ass just tried to get the scent of that hash off the microphone.
[04:23.760 --> 04:26.880]  Well, it's loud enough to where you just might do it, but you might want to check
[04:26.880 --> 04:30.640]  the headphones is where it's going to come through. Here, man, take a smell of it.
[04:30.640 --> 04:31.680]  Yeah, pass that over here.
[04:31.680 --> 04:33.280]  That is the orange Skittles Ambrosia.
[04:33.280 --> 04:36.800]  Y'all should see this jar. It's just a pile of crystals.
[04:36.800 --> 04:39.040]  That's a four gram jar and it is ...
[04:41.760 --> 04:42.560]  So good.
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.760]  It looks like the ... It's not the color, but it's the size of the row on the top of some sushi,
[04:47.760 --> 04:52.240]  is what it looks like. It has got that nice shiny texture and it's about the same size
[04:52.240 --> 04:55.760]  of some eggs you'd see on top of sushi. Maybe a little bit bigger than that.
[04:55.760 --> 04:59.280]  I probably just ruined a bunch of people's appetite by comparing it to the stuff on top
[04:59.440 --> 05:04.720]  of sushi, but it's beautiful. I'm really glad I went up there for that. It was, of course,
[05:04.720 --> 05:09.200]  apothecary or Ambrosia days at apothecary and I had to go up there and participate.
[05:09.200 --> 05:15.200]  So those are my grabs, the orange Skittles, the mochi gelato, and the StarDog Ambrosia.
[05:15.200 --> 05:17.040]  Of course, StarDog is always one of my favorites.
[05:17.040 --> 05:18.800]  It's a great strand.
[05:18.800 --> 05:23.440]  It's a four gram jar and it is just two giant crystals and a little bit of sauce in there.
[05:23.440 --> 05:28.560]  I prefer ... There's a little more sauce in there, but I prefer the star dog.
[05:28.560 --> 05:32.400]  There's a little more sauce in there than I would prefer, so I've been dunking other dabs into it.
[05:32.400 --> 05:33.520]  It's really accenting.
[05:33.520 --> 05:34.400]  Using those turps.
[05:34.400 --> 05:37.840]  Yeah, it's really nice. It's a really nice little accent for other things. I think the turps
[05:37.840 --> 05:42.160]  give it a little bit of a turbo boost. All right, so we went from not talking about what we were
[05:42.160 --> 05:47.760]  smoking to way talking about what we were smoking. Let's talk about Canada.
[05:48.720 --> 05:50.320]  Oh, Canada.
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.360]  All right, before we get into the Canada stuff, Mike told me a really funny story as we were
[05:55.360 --> 06:00.720]  setting up today. Let's talk about this poor dude in Canada that tried to hold an anti-cannabis
[06:00.720 --> 06:01.360]  rally.
[06:01.360 --> 06:08.000]  So, listeners of the show will know that I follow the anti-cannabis community pretty closely.
[06:09.360 --> 06:13.920]  And yeah, this popped across my screen this week. It was another anti-cannabis page
[06:14.960 --> 06:20.960]  lamenting that this is the way of things. And this dude up in Canada is just really,
[06:20.960 --> 06:28.240]  really teed off about legalization. And he was going to host an anti-cannabis march on the 17th
[06:28.240 --> 06:36.640]  Wednesday. It was sort of a counter show of force to the legalization in Canada. And he's canceling
[06:36.640 --> 06:39.760]  his event because of a lack of interest.
[06:40.480 --> 06:41.760]  Nobody wanted to come support his anti-
[06:41.760 --> 06:43.600]  Absolutely nobody is interested.
[06:44.160 --> 06:44.720]  That's awesome.
[06:45.520 --> 06:51.280]  And I just had to chuckle. The anti-cannabis community spent a lot of time over the last
[06:51.920 --> 06:58.240]  maybe four years of really trying to make it seem like there's this growing
[06:58.880 --> 07:04.240]  just wave of people who have had enough with legalization and are coming out to fight it.
[07:04.800 --> 07:10.240]  And it's really just like 14 people that each run three Facebook pages.
[07:11.200 --> 07:15.440]  And then Kevin Sabet and the five guys he pays. That's it.
[07:15.440 --> 07:18.480]  They're just hate typing all day long. Just no.
[07:19.360 --> 07:25.200]  And it just seems like there's a bunch of groups out there when there's really a handful of people.
[07:25.200 --> 07:29.360]  So nobody but those 14 folks showed up to protest in Canada?
[07:29.360 --> 07:35.440]  Well, no. Yeah, those 14 folks are spread out all over the US and none of them felt
[07:35.440 --> 07:39.440]  like traveling to Canada to help with this protest. So the dude got no interest.
[07:39.440 --> 07:40.000]  That's awesome.
[07:41.280 --> 07:41.840]  Sorry, dude.
[07:41.840 --> 07:45.120]  Put a thing up saying the event's canceled. No one's interested. You guys suck.
[07:46.560 --> 07:51.760]  It's a shame no one else isn't fired up about legalization and how it's going to destroy the
[07:51.760 --> 07:52.240]  country.
[07:52.240 --> 07:55.760]  People are fired up about legalization, but I think they're on the other side.
[07:55.760 --> 07:56.960]  I think they're supporting it.
[07:58.800 --> 08:03.200]  I've been fighting the urge to do a post on my page about this because I'm waiting for the
[08:03.200 --> 08:06.880]  shots of the crowds of people that come out to celebrate tomorrow.
[08:07.120 --> 08:07.620]  Yeah.
[08:08.080 --> 08:10.560]  I've been thinking about January 1st, 14.
[08:10.560 --> 08:13.840]  That's... Yeah, I was sitting around daydreaming about that. I was cooking my breakfast. I was
[08:13.840 --> 08:17.040]  like, Canada gets to do that tomorrow. That's going to be pretty cool.
[08:17.040 --> 08:22.320]  I realized that my receipt from the first day of legalization is still packed and was like,
[08:22.320 --> 08:25.280]  fuck, I need to get that box out. I really need to do that now.
[08:26.400 --> 08:30.080]  I haven't talked about this a lot, but because I was the first person to buy
[08:30.960 --> 08:36.400]  recreational cannabis in Pueblo, Colorado when cannabis became legal here recreationally.
[08:36.480 --> 08:40.400]  I still have the two bags of weed that I bought. I still have them.
[08:40.400 --> 08:41.440]  You still have the herb?
[08:41.440 --> 08:45.680]  Yep. I still have them in the original packaging. I may have the receipt stapled to one of the bags
[08:45.680 --> 08:47.920]  or next to it. They're near each other.
[08:47.920 --> 08:51.840]  When I got home and it settled in how much I fucking paid for that eighth, I was like,
[08:51.840 --> 08:55.440]  I have to smoke this shit. It's the most expensive weed I've ever paid for.
[08:55.440 --> 08:59.840]  I realized I bought weed on camera. I was on the news buying weed. They showed me,
[08:59.840 --> 09:03.200]  buy the weed and pay for it on the news. Then I shook the guy's hand and then they
[09:03.760 --> 09:07.520]  hit cut. Then we walked outside and they interviewed me outside and I said my name
[09:07.520 --> 09:11.520]  and they put my name on the screen. I was like, oh, I just bought weed from a guy on TV,
[09:11.520 --> 09:16.400]  put my full name out there. I was the first person to buy recreational cannabis in Colorado.
[09:16.960 --> 09:20.880]  People get to experience that all over the place tomorrow. People will be the first one in their
[09:21.600 --> 09:24.560]  nation. I'm not sure how they break it down. What are they in?
[09:24.560 --> 09:25.040]  Provinces.
[09:25.040 --> 09:28.000]  Provinces. Yeah. I think that's the word I'm looking for in Canada. You need to be the
[09:28.000 --> 09:31.360]  first person in your province and then you're even smaller and then even smaller. You know
[09:31.440 --> 09:34.400]  what I mean? You get more opportunities to be the first person in your whatever,
[09:34.400 --> 09:35.600]  at least in your dispensary.
[09:37.120 --> 09:42.880]  Canada's going to have a unique go of it. No one's legalized like they're about to.
[09:44.320 --> 09:51.280]  A lot of what we're going to go over is their first attempt at doing this right. The people
[09:51.280 --> 09:55.280]  involved know that there are a lot of rule changes coming over the next year or three.
[09:56.000 --> 09:57.200]  So these are not final.
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.560]  Yeah. And actually a lot of the articles I read say that they're pushing to change the rules.
[10:02.560 --> 10:05.040]  They just needed to get some rules in place to be on time.
[10:05.040 --> 10:08.800]  Yeah. On Wednesday, the rule will be this, but in the next year or two,
[10:08.800 --> 10:10.320]  we expect it to change to this.
[10:10.320 --> 10:14.160]  So we keep saying tomorrow or yesterday. This episode will either come out on Wednesday or
[10:14.160 --> 10:17.600]  Thursday. I have not decided when I will put this out. It depends on how the rest of my
[10:17.600 --> 10:22.160]  evening and recording progress goes. I may record another show. That's not relevant.
[10:22.160 --> 10:29.760]  But what we were talking about is October 17th, 2018, Canada will legalize adult use cannabis.
[10:30.960 --> 10:35.920]  It will be mostly legalized. Some municipalities like in the state in Colorado will be able to
[10:35.920 --> 10:44.080]  ban the use and sales, but for the most part, it is legal. One of the coolest parts is, and I'm
[10:44.080 --> 10:47.840]  kind of skipping ahead. Let's just stick to my notes here. I'm excited about one part. It keeps
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.680]  getting my attention. They will allow flowers. They will allow dried and cured flowers. You'll
[10:53.680 --> 11:00.000]  be able to use topicals. And it said oils will be available, but concentrates are not available yet.
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.960]  And edibles are not available yet. They have a year to figure that out. So you can get your
[11:04.960 --> 11:11.360]  topicals, you can get your flowers, but no dabs yet, no edibles yet. But they're in the works of
[11:11.360 --> 11:18.560]  that. They said about a year. It's available in dispensaries. There will be dispensaries available.
[11:19.520 --> 11:24.880]  Well, depending on where you live in Canada, there's been dispensaries for a while under
[11:25.920 --> 11:34.080]  either the medical program or there's a system of illegal dispensaries that operate like every
[11:34.080 --> 11:40.560]  other dispensary storefront, but no licensure or any of that stuff. There's a comedy club that has
[11:40.560 --> 11:46.480]  one of those gray area dispensaries above it, and they allow you to smoke in the comedy club. So
[11:46.480 --> 11:50.240]  you go up and buy your herb and you go down and smoke and watch a comedy show. I'm going to have
[11:50.240 --> 11:58.080]  to visit Canada soon. Yes. Yes. So another thing that really impresses me is the online ordering
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.800]  and delivery of cannabis. You can order online and have your stuff delivered. In some places,
[12:02.800 --> 12:07.120]  that'll be the only legal outlet. It's going to be coming through the mail. The 17th. It's
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.760]  completely legal to order your herb through the mail, to send your friend's stuff through the
[12:11.760 --> 12:17.120]  mail in Canada. That is so neat to me. I like that. So the California guys could just be growing some
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.360]  of that California stuff. Be like, Ross and Jeff, you want to try some of these flowers I grew and
[12:21.360 --> 12:24.560]  just send me a pound of it and I could try it. Then I could send them out a pound of whatever
[12:24.560 --> 12:29.520]  I grew and then we could try each other's stuff. Legal means legal and Canada's going legal.
[12:29.520 --> 12:34.000]  They're doing it right. That's one of the things I really like is the mail and online stuff that
[12:34.000 --> 12:40.400]  they're doing. Also, it's going to be affordable. You're going to like the price of cannabis. Then
[12:40.400 --> 12:46.640]  we'll talk about how much it costs here. Cannabis will be about $7 a gram in Canada,
[12:47.200 --> 12:54.000]  in Canadian dollars. That is five US dollars. So $5 a gram. From what I've seen and heard and read,
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.440]  I've got friends in Canada and I do some work with a couple of companies in Canada.
[12:57.440 --> 13:02.480]  It's not the quality of what we've got here, but it's close. I'm sure there are some places that
[13:02.480 --> 13:06.160]  are getting close to what some of our places are doing. You can't say that there are no good
[13:06.160 --> 13:10.560]  growers in a place. That always sounds stupid when you do that. It cracks me up how that's
[13:12.160 --> 13:19.520]  swung back and forth over the last 20 years. Canada was way better than the US growing herb
[13:19.520 --> 13:24.240]  up until the point, mid-legalization years, where the US stole the show.
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.680]  Now Canada's working for a comeback. They may just do it. They just may do it.
[13:29.680 --> 13:35.040]  So it's affordable. It's very affordable here in Colorado right now. It's about $10 a gram.
[13:35.040 --> 13:40.080]  You can find $8 grams. You can also find $17 grams, depending on where you're shopping
[13:40.080 --> 13:45.840]  and what quality you're looking for or how much advertising a place has done. It's not always
[13:45.840 --> 13:50.000]  about the quality, unfortunately. Sometimes the more expensive bud is not the best quality. That's
[13:50.000 --> 13:55.680]  not always the case. Some of the shops in Denver, the places I recommend, they've got closer to $15
[13:55.680 --> 14:00.640]  grams, but it's worth it. I think it's the stuff you're really looking for. That photogenic,
[14:00.640 --> 14:06.480]  frosty looking shit. So it's affordable. The ages, they did it a little differently. They
[14:06.480 --> 14:12.240]  have a little more trust in Canadian citizens. Canada is allowing ages 19 and up to participate
[14:12.800 --> 14:17.280]  in cannabis. In some places, I think it's as low as 18. That's what I've got here. In Quebec,
[14:17.280 --> 14:23.920]  you can be 18. So that's pretty cool. I hear you got to be 21. I'm pretty sure the brackets I saw
[14:23.920 --> 14:28.960]  with the Quebec, there's at least a group in Quebec looking to push that to 21 here in the
[14:28.960 --> 14:35.040]  next year or two. But at the start, it'll be 18. That's got to be so frustrating to start off at
[14:35.040 --> 14:39.120]  one age and then see people going, oh, next year I could smoke. And then they change the rules on
[14:39.120 --> 14:45.360]  them. Yeah. There's definitely a group of people that aren't old enough to enjoy it this week when
[14:45.360 --> 14:53.200]  it goes legal, but will be in a year or two if they don't change that law. It'll be rough for
[14:53.200 --> 14:57.040]  them if they change that law in the middle of there. And unfortunately, they're going to be
[14:57.040 --> 15:00.880]  the only ones out there voting to keep it that way because they're the only ones that care.
[15:00.880 --> 15:06.800]  So that's a small demographic. Canada has been explicit about why they have the age set there.
[15:06.800 --> 15:14.160]  They're really targeting the black market in Canada. It's been way too prevalent for way too
[15:14.160 --> 15:21.360]  long. They know that the 18 to 24 year old demographic are the largest, they're like a
[15:21.360 --> 15:27.840]  third of the marijuana consuming population is 18 to 24 year olds. And so they're targeting that
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.960]  whole bracket with legalization, at least in a couple of parts of the country. That's pretty
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.400]  cool. That is definitely a good idea. I agree with that. It makes a lot of sense. That's the
[15:38.400 --> 15:43.440]  black market age. That's when you buy from your black market friends. And then that's when people
[15:43.440 --> 15:47.840]  become black market dealers is that age because they have the black market friends. It's how it
[15:47.840 --> 15:51.920]  works. They go hand in hand. All those kids need and some guys got, so it works out. Yeah,
[15:51.920 --> 15:58.560]  they're going to eliminate that. That's pretty cool. Possession limits. You're allowed to possess
[15:58.560 --> 16:04.080]  30 grams. That's not bad. Nope, not bad at all. That's two. And that's just like,
[16:04.080 --> 16:07.600]  that's out in the world. It's 1.6 grams over an ounce.
[16:10.880 --> 16:14.240]  I liked that rant the other day, by the way. Yeah. Thank you. I'm glad you caught my call back
[16:14.240 --> 16:17.760]  there. So you can carry an ounce of weed with you, which if you're going out for the night
[16:17.760 --> 16:22.480]  or the weekend or whatever, that's plenty of herb. And if you're going out for the weekend,
[16:22.480 --> 16:26.400]  don't take a whole ounce with you. Just take a couple of eighths with you in one container so
[16:26.400 --> 16:29.360]  that you don't look like you're selling it. Take a quarter so that you don't go smoke all your
[16:29.360 --> 16:32.880]  weed with everybody. You'll have too many drinks and you'll smoke too many bowls. You'll be like,
[16:32.880 --> 16:38.160]  let's smoke another bowl. Or set it down on the table for a minute. Get up to grab his weed,
[16:38.160 --> 16:42.880]  come back to just a gram left in your baggie. Yeah. Don't take all your weed up because you'll
[16:42.880 --> 16:47.840]  smoke all your weed. That's one thing I learned. Let's see. You were allowed to smoke where you
[16:47.840 --> 16:53.920]  were allowed to consume cigarettes, which is basically- Yeah. I think that's across the
[16:53.920 --> 16:56.880]  country. Yeah. There are some places that are going to make their own specific rules on that,
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.800]  of course, because that's just how some municipalities go. It's what they like to do.
[17:00.800 --> 17:05.920]  Some places are uptight. You're not allowed to smoke in city parks or on city beaches,
[17:05.920 --> 17:10.960]  but they have said they will allow you to smoke in their national parks at their campground. So
[17:11.040 --> 17:14.960]  at your campground around the fire, you are allowed to light up. Here in Colorado,
[17:14.960 --> 17:20.880]  you cannot smoke in a national park. So if you were at the Pueblo Reservoir, whatever reservoir
[17:20.880 --> 17:25.040]  you were in, you cannot take your cannabis with you. And if you get caught, you were on federal
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.760]  land with cannabis, you could get in trouble. Honestly, most of the park rangers are pretty
[17:29.760 --> 17:33.520]  cool. They're people, they're humans too. A lot of the time, they're pretty cool. Like, hey, bro,
[17:33.520 --> 17:37.840]  you can't have that here. But there's always that one guy that wants to... I always talk about that
[17:37.840 --> 17:41.840]  one guy that wants to fuck up people's day and be a hero. So be careful of that guy.
[17:41.840 --> 17:48.560]  The US Park Service is having an issue with funding. So they're looking for anything to
[17:48.560 --> 17:52.320]  squeeze an extra buck. And the hippie with the stuff he's not supposed to have is definitely
[17:52.320 --> 17:56.480]  a way to do that. Yeah. You see my dreadlocked ass out there and my hiking shoes and my backpack
[17:56.480 --> 17:59.440]  and a dab rig. Yeah, you're getting searched. They're like, let's check this guy out, man.
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.800]  Yeah. So you can have your stuff there when you're camping. You can't have that stuff in Colorado
[18:04.800 --> 18:06.800]  in a national park is what I'm saying, just to be clear.
[18:07.440 --> 18:12.400]  That's the beauty of national legalization is there's no difference between state and federal.
[18:13.280 --> 18:16.960]  There's little rule policy changes, but it's not like it's illegal on this side of the line.
[18:17.680 --> 18:24.240]  So far, the rules say for home grows, you can grow four plants, four plants per home,
[18:24.240 --> 18:29.840]  not per person or per whatever it's per house is what I read so far. From what I understand,
[18:30.560 --> 18:36.320]  you can have four plants. Landlords can ban you from growing. That's up to the landlord.
[18:36.320 --> 18:40.400]  Some municipalities are going to ban that also. Of course, that's just how it is.
[18:40.400 --> 18:45.120]  A couple already have, I believe. Yes. Yes. Some places that have a lot of
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.560]  dispensary presence have banned that, which I see as kind of a capitalizing monopoly sort of a thing.
[18:51.360 --> 18:56.400]  Well, different parts of Canada have had major home grow issues for decades.
[18:57.360 --> 19:04.400]  I re-shared the union recently on my cannabis page because a big chunk of that is early
[19:04.400 --> 19:08.720]  2000s black market Canada production. When you said Canada and black market,
[19:08.720 --> 19:12.800]  I paused because I went, do I want to go that route and start talking about the union?
[19:12.800 --> 19:16.640]  So it looks like we are. Well, if you haven't seen it, it's a beautiful
[19:16.640 --> 19:22.400]  documentary that gives you a nice little snapshot of the black market in Canada in the early 2000s.
[19:23.040 --> 19:26.800]  And it's that experience that has the country where they are now.
[19:27.600 --> 19:31.920]  How come the part that stands out most to them, the most from that movie to me
[19:31.920 --> 19:35.920]  is when they had a power outage for several days and the guys are showing their grows. They're like,
[19:35.920 --> 19:39.200]  I don't know. I haven't had power for like four days and they're still going.
[19:39.200 --> 19:42.160]  I hope everything comes out already. Different documentary.
[19:42.160 --> 19:45.360]  Watching these guys. Is that a different documentary? I was watching these Canadian
[19:45.360 --> 19:48.480]  growers freak out because they haven't had power for so many days and they're talking about their
[19:48.480 --> 19:52.160]  grows and how important it is that it comes through because they put all this money into it.
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.920]  And they're like, so far in, I understand that feeling like, but I was just like, Oh man,
[19:55.920 --> 19:59.440]  they've had, they had like four feet of snow outside and they hadn't had power for days.
[19:59.440 --> 20:03.680]  And I was like, that crop dude is so close to being done. They were shining flashlights on it
[20:03.680 --> 20:07.360]  and shit just to keep it alive. It's like, it just needs a little bit of light every day. It'll be
[20:07.360 --> 20:12.160]  all right. Like, Oh man, what documentary is that? What movie is that? I can't remember off the name
[20:12.160 --> 20:15.440]  of my head or off the top of my head, but I've seen it. Somebody out there is watching. Send
[20:15.440 --> 20:19.600]  me a tweet. It's at GFYH podcast. Let me know what movie my brain is trying to remember. I've
[20:19.600 --> 20:24.480]  got a traumatic brain injury, so it's in there. It's just not labeled accurately anymore. The
[20:24.480 --> 20:27.920]  contents fell out of the folder and now I'm just reading a file. And then I'm like, Oh,
[20:27.920 --> 20:34.480]  here's a part about a movie. Yep. The one thing that is going to drive people nuts about Canada's
[20:34.480 --> 20:40.080]  legalization is the little nuanced rules. Like I know there are a bunch of people that are annoyed
[20:40.080 --> 20:45.120]  that concentrates and edibles they're holding off for a year. And that's largely because of
[20:46.080 --> 20:52.800]  anti-cannabis groups. Two big talking points that have taken hold are that edibles are scary and bad
[20:52.800 --> 20:58.640]  for kids and concentrates are super potent. And we've never had anything this potent before.
[20:59.200 --> 21:05.520]  It's up to 99% THC now. They rant about it all the time. It's total fucking nonsense. The THC
[21:05.520 --> 21:09.840]  pill that's been legal since the seventies is a hundred percent THC. I wish I could just explain
[21:09.840 --> 21:14.240]  to these people. I wish I could explain to them that if you give me a concentrate that is
[21:14.240 --> 21:20.000]  50% THC and a concentrate that's a hundred percent THC, probably going to take two dabs
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.760]  of the a hundred and four dabs of the 50. I'm going to get the same high. I'm just going to
[21:25.760 --> 21:34.000]  consume less dabs of the other one. The only thing the anti-cannabis community understands
[21:34.000 --> 21:39.520]  about concentrates is that they look scary and the numbers sound scary. Yeah. You got to bust
[21:39.520 --> 21:43.840]  out a torch. They love talking about the blow torch, but they always fuck it up. They go,
[21:44.400 --> 21:49.360]  this stuff's it's, it's not weed. It's you don't have to light weed with a blow torch. They,
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.920]  right. They think that we're setting the hash on fire with the blow torch.
[21:53.920 --> 21:59.440]  Ah, yeah. They don't at all understand that we're heating a surface to vaporize a concentrate
[22:00.240 --> 22:06.240]  and that it's just a complicated tool involved way of hitting a vape pen.
[22:06.240 --> 22:10.080]  The hippie rant in me is like, they don't want you to understand that man. That makes it
[22:10.080 --> 22:14.960]  acceptable, man. If they took a moment to explain it and they're like, man, so what we're doing is
[22:14.960 --> 22:19.360]  vaporizing. Now the newscaster never does that. They go, then they heat the hash with a blow
[22:19.360 --> 22:23.360]  torch and smoke it like a crack rock. Just because that sells more, it gets more clicks.
[22:23.360 --> 22:29.200]  It doesn't sound like a simple explanation doesn't get any attention. You got to create fear.
[22:29.200 --> 22:33.440]  There's only one or two of them that are capable of higher level thinking of that nature.
[22:34.080 --> 22:37.600]  The rest of them, it's just, no, seriously, you'll, if you follow these people for more
[22:37.600 --> 22:42.480]  than a week or two, you start watching them get confused by shit that everybody should know.
[22:43.840 --> 22:50.960]  One of them tried to hand out her own printout literature outside of the cannabis conference
[22:50.960 --> 22:56.880]  they do every year here at PCC. She couldn't understand why there was a process she had to go
[22:56.880 --> 23:03.200]  through before she handed out literature on campus. Oh yeah. That's a campus lady.
[23:03.840 --> 23:08.560]  And she's like, well, I went here like four years ago. And the person she's talking to in the video
[23:08.560 --> 23:14.880]  is like, why the fuck don't you understand what I'm saying? You claim to have attended here and
[23:14.880 --> 23:19.120]  graduated from here, but you don't know basic rules about this space. First of all, you don't
[23:19.120 --> 23:25.360]  go here. You need to leave. You didn't pay money to be here. Bye lady. Oh, you don't have a permit
[23:25.360 --> 23:29.680]  to put out approved pamphlets. No, you can't be here. No, I get it. What if she's passing out
[23:29.680 --> 23:34.320]  some sort of like, come join our cult and you're passing it out on that campus. Now that campus
[23:34.320 --> 23:39.760]  could be liable for that cult. Most of those rules exist because fucking white supremacists used to
[23:39.760 --> 23:42.880]  do it all the time. See, I wasn't going to pick a group. I didn't want to give anybody any shout
[23:42.880 --> 23:46.960]  outs. That's why I said cult. They fucked it up for everybody. Now everybody's got to submit their
[23:46.960 --> 23:53.680]  form two weeks in advance and have two heads of whatever stamp it. They fucked it up for everybody.
[23:53.680 --> 23:57.120]  Makes sense though. I don't want you coming and standing in my front yard and passing out your
[23:57.120 --> 24:01.120]  white power pamphlets. That's totally not what I support. Right. Come out there and have a barbecue.
[24:02.320 --> 24:08.160]  Like, Hey, wait a minute, bro. Oh, there's like seven side rants. I'm trying not to go on right
[24:08.160 --> 24:12.000]  now. We got off on it. That's cool. We've been, no, we got really far into this before the rants
[24:12.000 --> 24:16.480]  happened. Tim Hortons, buy stock in Tim Hortons. Let's get some poutine. Hey, I've got a lot of
[24:16.480 --> 24:20.320]  friends out in Canada. So big shout out to all of them. Thanks for, uh, thanks for letting me
[24:20.320 --> 24:28.400]  make fun of you guys. Uh, if you're in Canada, listening to this, enjoy this moment. Um, one of
[24:28.400 --> 24:35.600]  the coolest things in Colorado was watching how little things change after legalization.
[24:36.480 --> 24:45.920]  Like you don't see people buying weed in the park as often. True. Um, the glass that you see in head
[24:45.920 --> 24:53.920]  shops changes rapidly. Oh yeah. Um, some products on the market evolve very, very quickly. I
[24:53.920 --> 24:58.720]  remember the, when there was like one company doing hash, like we've got on the table and now
[24:58.720 --> 25:05.280]  there's like 40. Oh yeah. And it's only been months, six, eight months. So quickly. Um,
[25:05.840 --> 25:11.600]  remember six years ago we thought clear shatter was the most amazing shit. Yep. Um, when that
[25:11.600 --> 25:16.160]  dude holding the ice puck from the hood of his car was the most famous dude on Instagram. Yeah.
[25:16.960 --> 25:23.680]  Um, but like clothing, the different parts of the community, like, uh, places where like the
[25:23.680 --> 25:29.280]  comedy club where you can go and enjoy cannabis, right. You will see other little places like that
[25:29.280 --> 25:33.520]  pop up and there's several, which technically is not legal, by the way. Let me mention that
[25:33.520 --> 25:38.960]  kind of technically that is not legal at this time. The ones that are up and running now,
[25:39.920 --> 25:45.760]  the smart ones are already lobbying local government to, Hey, there's a need for this.
[25:45.760 --> 25:51.520]  We have a customer base that loves us. Um, there's clearly a need for this in our community,
[25:51.520 --> 25:56.960]  license it, regulate it, tell us where to be, tell us when we can be open and tell us how loud we can
[25:56.960 --> 26:02.400]  be. Um, tell us what other stuff we can do there. And we're down. Um, I can't help but think there
[26:02.400 --> 26:08.720]  was just a bar that got in trouble for ax throwing. Oh yeah. I saw that. Um, where the, the
[26:08.720 --> 26:13.520]  local people regulators from some segment that covers the bar industry showed up and they had
[26:13.520 --> 26:19.040]  like dudes and flip-flops throwing axes at liquor bottles. I don't think it was at liquor bottles,
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.920]  but that was one of the violations is they were throwing them empty liquor bottles. Awesome. Um,
[26:23.920 --> 26:27.920]  and they're like, you can't have broken glass and flip-flops and flying fucking axes at the
[26:27.920 --> 26:34.000]  same time with drunks. What part of Florida was this? I don't even remember, but I mean,
[26:34.080 --> 26:39.600]  when you've got that in the world and you're just talking about like, I want to do like good coffee,
[26:40.160 --> 26:45.840]  some cheesecakes and weed with some booths and maybe some soft music.
[26:46.480 --> 26:52.160]  Like why is that so hard to figure out rules for the children? Mike,
[26:54.720 --> 27:00.240]  I almost said something. I probably would have laughed out later, but you got kids now. Well,
[27:00.240 --> 27:05.680]  like if we can do guns and we can do fucking prescription drugs and we can do cars and we
[27:05.680 --> 27:09.840]  can do fucking air travel, we can figure out how to sell weed and coffee next to each other.
[27:11.280 --> 27:20.320]  The dangerous list doesn't include weed, like lawn equipment, tide pods, fucking snowblowers,
[27:20.320 --> 27:25.920]  quicksand drive. This is the driving's like the most dangerous activity humans engage in
[27:25.920 --> 27:32.800]  regularly. And we don't have any sort of awareness of that. And then you see people
[27:32.800 --> 27:38.480]  talking about consumption spaces or cannabis cafes. Like in some of the articles I was reading
[27:38.480 --> 27:44.400]  about Canada, if you don't own your own property, like you're not a homeowner, you rent an apartment,
[27:45.440 --> 27:50.080]  depending on the part of Canada you're in and your landlord's preference,
[27:50.080 --> 27:55.680]  there may be no legal space anywhere within miles and miles of you for you to consume cannabis.
[27:56.720 --> 28:00.480]  And so you're just like a tourist in Denver with a hotel that says no smoking.
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.320]  There's no legal place for you to consume. It's like you can see through the computer
[28:04.320 --> 28:06.960]  and you can see my notes because that's my next bullet point. That was pretty good.
[28:08.240 --> 28:13.120]  But when you sit down and talk about regulating these kinds of spaces,
[28:13.680 --> 28:19.200]  people bring up the craziest shit. And I feel like such an asshole when I'm like,
[28:20.160 --> 28:27.440]  but everywhere in the civilized world already has an infrastructure in place for adults to leave
[28:27.440 --> 28:33.600]  their home or place of residence, go to an outside location, a secondary location where they don't
[28:33.600 --> 28:41.920]  live, get very intoxicated and then return home safely. And we've designed this system in every
[28:41.920 --> 28:48.160]  part of America, every part of Canada, all over Europe to get people from their house to the bar
[28:48.160 --> 28:54.560]  and back again in one piece. And because we're talking about cannabis, people are like, well,
[28:54.560 --> 28:59.520]  how are they going to get home? And it's like, well, because Uber is still a thing and you can
[28:59.520 --> 29:03.520]  be high and work that out. It would increase commerce. You're going to go to a place.
[29:05.280 --> 29:11.280]  So you go to, let's say, let's create Mike and Jeff's little fucking chill and smoke lounge in
[29:11.280 --> 29:14.720]  the living room. That's the official name of our business. Mike and Jeff's little chill and smoke
[29:14.720 --> 29:19.440]  lounge over there in the living room. I like it. It's two couches. Coffee and cheesecake.
[29:19.440 --> 29:24.960]  I want coffee cake with little crumbly stuff on top. Maybe a muffin or something. We got some
[29:24.960 --> 29:28.080]  stuff like that available. That's what I wanted there. Maybe some espresso. Do we do the whole
[29:28.080 --> 29:32.400]  muffin or just the top? Or am I getting too detailed? Can you just order muffin tops?
[29:32.400 --> 29:38.480]  That's a fucking thing, dude. Bro, we're, fuck the muffin bottoms. You can send those to third
[29:38.480 --> 29:43.040]  world countries where they belong. Those are for beer drinkers. We just sell the tops here.
[29:43.120 --> 29:46.560]  All right. Let's get back on track here. So I'm trying to put myself on track. I got pretty high
[29:46.560 --> 29:50.000]  off those dabs. We're going to have to dab here again in a minute. So we've got a smoke lounge.
[29:50.000 --> 29:53.600]  People walk in. We offer, we can't offer concentrates because it's Canada. That's
[29:53.600 --> 29:58.960]  not allowed. We offer bong rips or vapes. They will say vapes because clean air, it's easier.
[29:58.960 --> 30:02.720]  So whatever you pay a cover to get in or whatever you pay a membership, you come in,
[30:02.720 --> 30:07.360]  you take a vape. What's the next thing you do? Need a drink, bro. Now you're going to-
[30:07.360 --> 30:08.320]  I'm going to drink and a snack.
[30:08.320 --> 30:11.680]  If we offer you a good drink and a good snack, you're going to spend a little bit more money,
[30:11.680 --> 30:15.600]  which we're going to put back in with taxes, which goes back into the community. Now, at the
[30:15.600 --> 30:19.520]  end of the day, you'd be like, well, now I got to get myself from here over to the Tim Hortons to go
[30:19.520 --> 30:25.760]  meet up with Timmy and Miss Cannabis and Full Monty and all my other Canadian friends. And
[30:25.760 --> 30:26.880]  I got to get in an Uber.
[30:26.880 --> 30:31.600]  Dude, if there was a place that had good food and drinks in our area that allowed us to consume
[30:31.600 --> 30:35.120]  cannabis there, we don't record at least half of these shows there.
[30:35.120 --> 30:38.320]  I was going to say I'd record there and we'd have more people meet us there. And it would be
[30:38.400 --> 30:42.160]  a thing. People would flow. People would come and go onto the podcast. Other cannabis consumers
[30:42.160 --> 30:44.880]  would be like, hey, can I have a seat here on the show? I'm like, yeah, bro, sit on in.
[30:47.520 --> 30:52.560]  Oh my God, it'd be so great. But when you talk about this stuff, especially here in the States,
[30:53.200 --> 30:59.440]  you have to overcome several fucking hurdles that are just insurmountable, it seems like.
[30:59.440 --> 31:05.440]  And one of them is half the population pretends like we don't have a way to go out, get drunk,
[31:05.440 --> 31:13.840]  and get home in one piece. You run into all this nonsense about how everybody just enjoys the
[31:13.840 --> 31:18.400]  flavor of alcoholic beverages. It's like, well, we'll just have one glass of dinner. That's the
[31:18.400 --> 31:21.600]  social consumption norm. And it's like, well, then why the fuck do they have it at Little League
[31:21.600 --> 31:28.400]  soccer games? There's literally booze everywhere. We can't just have three or four places around
[31:28.400 --> 31:34.800]  the city to go and maybe bowl, maybe watch a movie or see a standup act.
[31:34.800 --> 31:39.440]  You would be way more likely to get me to go bowling if I could go bowling for bong hits.
[31:39.440 --> 31:44.400]  If I could go roll a strike and every time I got a strike, I want to dab, I would shoot
[31:44.400 --> 31:49.280]  two 60s. I would be a sharp shooter, bro. You wouldn't want to fuck with me at the bowling
[31:49.280 --> 31:53.520]  alley. I've got bowling experience. If they just set it aside at night and they were like,
[31:53.520 --> 32:00.240]  Wednesday nights, it's cannabis consumption night. You have to be over the legal age in this area to
[32:00.240 --> 32:08.400]  come in. You're getting ID'd hard at the door. Bring your owner, knock yourself out. I'd go at
[32:08.400 --> 32:13.680]  least twice a month. Hell yeah, bro. Yeah. What else could we do? What would other be the movie
[32:13.680 --> 32:18.160]  theater? If I could just take a dab in the middle, there's always that point about 45 to an hour in a
[32:18.160 --> 32:22.240]  movie. You probably started going, I could use a cigarette. That's when my brain goes, hey,
[32:22.240 --> 32:26.880]  you're going to take a dab or what, dude? If I could just walk up to the little, it's got to be
[32:26.880 --> 32:32.480]  silent. You don't want to hear the torch in there. Fucking 22 dudes watching Dazed and Confused with
[32:32.480 --> 32:36.000]  the torch going. No, but if I could walk up to a little email station and just take a,
[32:37.680 --> 32:42.160]  and then go back to my seat, bro, I'd be way more likely to go watch a movie. If Walmart had a dab
[32:42.160 --> 32:47.040]  station, no, let's not say Walmart. People don't want us to shop at Walmart. If my local family
[32:47.040 --> 32:54.400]  owned and operated organically, locally sourced, gluten-free, vegan. I'm just going to say the
[32:54.400 --> 32:59.600]  butcher. Yeah, right. I'm just trying to be silly and socially conscious at the same time.
[33:00.720 --> 33:05.760]  But there's a dozen different businesses that would increase their customer flow if-
[33:05.760 --> 33:06.960]  The skating rink. No, I get it.
[33:06.960 --> 33:11.600]  Consumption was allowed at some segment. There was a restaurant up in Denver that wanted to do,
[33:11.600 --> 33:16.160]  they were going to do the second story. They had a second story seating area that was just overflow
[33:16.720 --> 33:19.920]  and they were just going to permanently market off as the cannabis section.
[33:20.560 --> 33:25.920]  And people freaked the fuck out. We had a friend throw a birthday party at probably
[33:25.920 --> 33:29.360]  that restaurant because they had an upstairs section that was an overflow.
[33:30.160 --> 33:33.200]  And when I walked in- Yeah, they were open for a while before they got shut down.
[33:33.200 --> 33:37.920]  There were rigs and it was all of our stuff. Everybody brought a rig and a torch and there
[33:37.920 --> 33:43.440]  were rigs. So it was fancy dinner plates and wine glasses and wine bottles and bread and dabs. And
[33:43.440 --> 33:47.440]  we were between each course, we'd be like, hey, have you tried this concentrate? And we'd take a
[33:47.440 --> 33:52.080]  couple of dabs with each other. We dabbed out the wait staff, we dabbed out the cook. They all came
[33:52.080 --> 33:54.720]  back and they're like, you guys partying up here? And we're like, yeah, it's her birthday. And they're
[33:54.720 --> 33:59.840]  like, cool, take dabs. And it was a great time. They had a good time with us. We got them stoned.
[33:59.840 --> 34:03.600]  And when I'm stoned and I cook, my food just tastes... I don't know if it's because I'm stoned
[34:03.600 --> 34:07.760]  and I'm eating it or if it's because I was stoned and I cooked it and I just did something magical.
[34:07.760 --> 34:13.040]  It's like, I can make a hell of a grilled cheese sandwich and I can watch my mom make... My mom
[34:13.120 --> 34:18.160]  and I could get the same exact pan, the same bread, same butter, same cheese, same everything.
[34:18.160 --> 34:21.280]  And her grilled cheese sandwich is just going to taste a little bit fucking better than mine.
[34:21.280 --> 34:24.640]  I don't know what she does. It just comes out of... It's because my mama made it.
[34:24.640 --> 34:28.640]  And it's just that little sprinkle. That's what it's like when I get stoned and make my food.
[34:28.640 --> 34:33.040]  It's like putting mama magic in it. It's that little extra touch. So you get stoned with the
[34:33.040 --> 34:36.560]  wait staff and they go down there and they make a nice stoned ass meal. And then you're getting
[34:36.560 --> 34:39.520]  stoned and eating too. And there's nothing wrong with it. There's no problem. And then you're
[34:39.520 --> 34:43.760]  eating. So you're not lit when you leave, you hang out. And what about the other people that
[34:43.760 --> 34:50.160]  are drinking wine downstairs? What's the difference? We used to go to, in college,
[34:50.160 --> 34:54.080]  there was a place where... I can't remember the price, but it was a lot. It was for 60 or 70
[34:54.080 --> 34:59.440]  bucks. You'd sit down and you'd get nine different tumblers of whiskey. I never ordered that.
[34:59.440 --> 35:06.560]  Nine? But it was all little sample sizes, but still. And they had a little map and it was like,
[35:06.560 --> 35:10.240]  this one's from here and this one's from here and this one's from here. And the thing I liked
[35:10.240 --> 35:14.400]  there was their burger. But a number of my friends were really into that fucking expensive booze
[35:14.400 --> 35:21.840]  thing. And if they can have that, are we really asking that much? And honestly, I think Canada's
[35:21.840 --> 35:24.560]  going to get their way fucked before we do. Canada's got it right.
[35:24.560 --> 35:26.000]  Way before we do. Canada has got...
[35:26.000 --> 35:29.600]  They've got some ugly hurdles they're going to have to go over the next few years for sure.
[35:29.600 --> 35:34.080]  Yeah. But they're on the way, on the business path, they're doing it right. On the consumption
[35:34.080 --> 35:36.880]  path, I think they're going to do it right. They're going to have import and export with
[35:36.880 --> 35:43.920]  other countries. Only for two very specific. It's not recreational import export. It's for
[35:43.920 --> 35:46.240]  medical research and for something else. Okay.
[35:47.760 --> 35:50.720]  But they're starting with import export. Everybody else is on lockdown.
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.120]  The one or two rules that I see that they're really going to end up fighting over are
[35:59.360 --> 36:08.480]  a consumption spaces and the age limit. I think the edibles and concentrates,
[36:08.480 --> 36:11.200]  they're just going to end up hammering out packaging rules like we did here.
[36:11.200 --> 36:15.200]  Oh yeah. That'll take them two years. They say one year, but they'll get on it in about six
[36:15.200 --> 36:17.840]  months and they'll make it happen in a year and a half after that.
[36:17.840 --> 36:21.120]  And their biggest hurdle is probably going to be the existing market.
[36:21.680 --> 36:29.120]  They've got a multi-tiered black market, gray market, white market system in place already.
[36:29.120 --> 36:34.640]  And a lot of that's locked out of the legal industry they're looking to create now.
[36:35.600 --> 36:41.600]  My favorite thing I learned from this episode was the idea of allowing 19 and 18 year old citizens
[36:41.600 --> 36:46.000]  to purchase and possess cannabis to further eradicate the black market. I think that's a
[36:46.000 --> 36:50.560]  really good strategy. When you explained to me why, what kind of dawned on me as you started
[36:50.560 --> 36:54.960]  saying was like, oh man, because that's when I was buying and selling the most black market
[36:54.960 --> 36:59.680]  cannabis was between the ages of probably, I shouldn't admit like 17 to 24-ish was when I
[36:59.680 --> 37:05.680]  was really banging out the black market product. So yeah, you could probably change people's lives.
[37:05.680 --> 37:10.080]  You can keep people out of trouble and keep people from taking that path and also falling
[37:10.080 --> 37:12.880]  into trouble because their friend took that path and they bought it from them.
[37:15.040 --> 37:19.920]  The real destruction that kind of flows out from the black market is the market part.
[37:20.960 --> 37:32.000]  It's the amount of employees, threats, secrets, shenanigans it takes to produce and distribute
[37:32.000 --> 37:37.360]  billions and billions of dollars with the cannabis is just fucking nuts. And if you look at the size
[37:37.360 --> 37:41.920]  of the marketplace, it's huge. And then you start doing the math and you're like, all right, so like
[37:41.920 --> 37:47.760]  a big home grows like 2 million a year, divide by 35 billion, how many houses is that? Fuck.
[37:48.320 --> 37:53.600]  Like it gets crazy fast. And then you figure about how many little dealers and shit,
[37:54.880 --> 38:00.080]  all of that market is going to start changing. And we watched it here in Colorado where
[38:00.080 --> 38:07.360]  you had 10 friends that all sold their, and kind of worked in a community where when somebody was
[38:07.360 --> 38:12.000]  low, they would buy from the others. And when somebody grew a strain that was really good,
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.920]  that other consumers like, they'd trade and one by one, all of those people started dropping out
[38:17.920 --> 38:22.960]  of the game and converting into full legal or leaving to someplace where the black market was
[38:22.960 --> 38:29.200]  still thriving. But we completely eradicated the distribution end of the black market in Colorado.
[38:29.200 --> 38:30.560]  Trey Lockerbies, MPH- Yeah. They all got jobs at
[38:30.560 --> 38:34.320]  Grows or Dispensaries or as Trimmers or wherever else.
[38:34.320 --> 38:36.560]  Michael Strongmansdee You see people talk about,
[38:36.640 --> 38:42.000]  all they have to do is just don't charge the taxes and there's still no fucking profit in it.
[38:42.000 --> 38:42.400]  Trey Lockerbies Right.
[38:42.400 --> 38:45.760]  Michael Strongmansdee Like you can't make a living with three
[38:45.760 --> 38:50.080]  lights in a basement and $5 grams. Trey Lockerbies
[38:50.080 --> 38:52.240]  And it's not worth it anymore. There's so much competition.
[38:52.240 --> 38:55.840]  Michael Strongmansdee Yeah. There's literally no profit in it.
[38:56.400 --> 39:03.360]  You're barely making what it took to produce back on it. And if you're only doing that at an at-home
[39:03.360 --> 39:09.760]  scale, there's literally no fucking money in it. You've got to do 100% of the work yourself. There's
[39:09.760 --> 39:15.760]  no wiggle room in your profit margins for helpers or waterers or trimmers or it's miserable. And so
[39:15.760 --> 39:17.040]  one by one, they all drop out. Trey Lockerbies
[39:17.040 --> 39:20.480]  Trim all that shit yourself again. I don't miss those days.
[39:20.480 --> 39:24.080]  Michael Strongmansdee Oh, and for a dollar, a profit a gram,
[39:25.200 --> 39:28.800]  when it was 20 a gram all day long to everybody, it was worth it.
[39:28.800 --> 39:29.440]  Trey Lockerbies Oh, yeah.
[39:29.440 --> 39:33.120]  Michael Strongmansdee But that's all your profit that's gone now.
[39:33.200 --> 39:40.560]  Pounds went from 4,000 to 35 to 32. They stayed at 32 for a couple of years.
[39:41.120 --> 39:47.680]  And they started getting like 27 and then they were 25 for quite a while. And then the next summer,
[39:48.400 --> 39:53.920]  1,500. And you were like, oh shit, my weed's not worth anything. $100 an ounce if I'm lucky.
[39:53.920 --> 40:01.520]  And now in Colorado, you can get a pound of weed for 1,200, maybe $900 if you want that
[40:01.520 --> 40:05.280]  low shelf, not beautiful stuff, but it's available. And a lot of people-
[40:05.280 --> 40:06.720]  Trey Lockerbies Depending on the time of the year and which
[40:06.720 --> 40:08.320]  market you're pushing in. Michael Strongmansdee
[40:08.320 --> 40:12.800]  Give it a month from here, you're going to see $1,000 pounds all over the place a month.
[40:12.800 --> 40:16.160]  Trey Lockerbies We had two nasty cold freezes at the start of October.
[40:16.160 --> 40:19.680]  Like people are going to be early harvesting, which means their crop didn't finish right.
[40:19.680 --> 40:28.080]  When you add that into places that have acreage in the legal market, when that hits the rec market,
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.920]  the whole industry just holds their breath for four months until that fucking supply's gone.
[40:33.920 --> 40:36.800]  Michael Strongmansdee Yep. You see a lot of hatch. You see a lot
[40:36.800 --> 40:38.640]  of different kinds of concentrates. Trey Lockerbies
[40:38.640 --> 40:43.360]  But Canada's about to get all of this. You guys are lucky. It's fun right now.
[40:43.360 --> 40:46.560]  Michael Strongmansdee Yeah. It's so much fun to watch. I'm going to try to get this episode out
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.040]  as soon as I can so that Canada can enjoy this on their day of legalization. Congratulations, Canada.
[40:51.040 --> 40:55.360]  Hey, Mike, we've been going for close to 45 minutes. I know you've got some more to be,
[40:55.360 --> 41:00.240]  so I'm going to cue you for your Mike's moments. If you've got any ending rants,
[41:00.240 --> 41:02.320]  let's get them out of here now so we can start wrapping up the show.
[41:02.320 --> 41:04.320]  Mike Schruber I admonish somebody for trying to do a final
[41:04.320 --> 41:10.320]  thought because only Terry gets to do that shit. All right, if you insist. If you're in Canada and
[41:10.320 --> 41:18.240]  don't dig the rules that are rolling out in your area, by all means, work to change them. It's
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.640]  real easy to get involved. There are several organizations already fighting this fight in
[41:22.640 --> 41:28.080]  Canada. All you have to do is lend your support. There are several ways to do that real easy.
[41:28.080 --> 41:34.160]  Contact me if you're looking for specifics and enjoy it. This is something that
[41:36.080 --> 41:40.880]  thousands and thousands of people have been fighting for their whole lives to achieve,
[41:40.880 --> 41:45.200]  and Canada's going legal coast to coast, and everyone up there should get to enjoy this.
[41:46.400 --> 41:50.800]  To all the anti-pop people, ha, ha, ha. The harder you fight, the easier this fight gets.
[41:50.960 --> 41:54.560]  Preston Pysh I like that. Good wrap-up with Mike there. Hey,
[41:54.560 --> 41:57.520]  dude, thanks for coming and hanging out, spending some of the late afternoon with me.
[41:57.520 --> 41:58.160]  Mike Schruber Hell yeah.
[41:58.160 --> 41:59.360]  Preston Pysh We're going to get you out of here so that
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.400]  you can get home on time and not get yourself in trouble. I'm glad I was paying attention to the
[42:02.400 --> 42:04.240]  time. Ladies and gentlemen- Mike Schruber
[42:04.240 --> 42:05.840]  I'm going to grab somebody from daycare. Preston Pysh
[42:05.840 --> 42:08.720]  Get the kid from... Oh, I didn't even realize you had to get the kid from daycare. I'm glad I was
[42:08.720 --> 42:10.160]  paying close attention. Wow. Mike Schruber
[42:10.160 --> 42:10.880]  Me too. Preston Pysh
[42:10.880 --> 42:15.600]  Wow. That almost got awkward. You almost Bert Kreischer'd that shit.
[42:16.880 --> 42:20.080]  If you listen to Bert, you know what I mean. All right, guys, thanks for listening. Canada,
[42:20.080 --> 42:25.760]  congratulations. Welcome to the club. Enjoy it. I hope you like it. I hope it's fun for you. I
[42:25.760 --> 42:27.840]  hope it goes well for you. I'm sure it will. Mike Schruber
[42:27.840 --> 42:31.280]  We got good and baked and this got rambly, so thank you all for listening.
[42:31.280 --> 42:32.640]  Preston Pysh A lot of people really enjoy
[42:32.640 --> 42:36.560]  hanging out with us when we get good and baked because they say that they don't have stoner
[42:36.560 --> 42:39.920]  friends that can just hang out and take a bunch of dabs and ramble and hang out. So they got to
[42:39.920 --> 42:43.760]  come hang out at the table with us. I've been doing a long series of intensive grow lessons.
[42:43.760 --> 42:44.800]  Mike Schruber David amazing.
[42:44.800 --> 42:47.600]  Preston Pysh Thank you, bro. This has been... Those lessons
[42:47.600 --> 42:52.880]  aren't stressful, but I don't get to just hang out and take dabs during those. I'm trying to
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.760]  stay focused and there's some editing. So those are way different. So this was chill, more like
[42:57.760 --> 43:02.080]  the substitute teacher was here, a rainy day at school. I got to goof off a little bit, which was
[43:02.080 --> 43:03.680]  nice. So thank you for that, bro. Mike Schruber
[43:03.680 --> 43:10.320]  Yeah. Listeners, I've been extra busy and sick lately. And so I have not been on in weeks and
[43:10.320 --> 43:13.200]  weeks and weeks. And I will try to get over here more and more often.
[43:13.200 --> 43:14.080]  Preston Pysh Yeah, you can just take that
[43:14.080 --> 43:16.800]  microphone with you. Right? Mike Schruber
[43:16.800 --> 43:22.880]  We're close to working on a solution where I can join the podcast from my little cubicle in my
[43:22.880 --> 43:27.040]  world. But until then, I have to actually get over to the studio.
[43:27.040 --> 43:28.880]  Preston Pysh I know how to make it happen.
[43:28.880 --> 43:30.720]  Mike Schruber Yeah. It's happening more and more
[43:30.720 --> 43:32.400]  often, hopefully here in the near future. Preston Pysh
[43:32.400 --> 43:34.960]  One small purchase. We can probably get Mike lined up like that.
[43:35.840 --> 43:37.200]  Dude, thanks for coming. Thanks for hanging out.
[43:37.200 --> 43:38.320]  Mike Schruber Yeah. Thanks for having me, man.
[43:38.320 --> 43:39.200]  Thanks for listening, everybody.
[43:39.200 --> 43:40.240]  Preston Pysh Yeah, everybody. Thank you for
[43:40.240 --> 43:43.600]  listening. Thanks for hanging out. This is how I wrap up the show all the time. If you feel like

[44:02.000 --> 44:05.360]  for the whole episode. Now I've got to replace it because he's a little sick, but he got a fresh
[44:05.360 --> 44:09.600]  one. We're going to throw it right away. I also bought a MacBook. That's what the funding goes

[45:52.400 --> 45:55.760]  anything else to say? I gave you your final moments. You're done. I'm turning off your mic.
[45:55.760 --> 45:59.920]  My thoughts are complete, I think. Your thoughts are complete. Holy shit.
[46:00.640 --> 46:03.520]  I'm still getting baked. Yeah, we're going to get even good and baked,
[46:03.680 --> 46:06.880]  or at least I am because you've got to go somewhere. I've got to go and be responsible.
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.440]  Mike's going to watch me get good and baked here in just a moment. You guys, I'll be back when this
[46:13.440 --> 46:17.440]  one comes out. When does this one come out? Okay. Yeah. I may be back with another episode this week.
[46:17.440 --> 46:21.200]  I guarantee you I'll be back Monday with a fresh new episode. I want to give a huge shout out to
[46:21.200 --> 46:26.160]  my friend James Butterson. And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
