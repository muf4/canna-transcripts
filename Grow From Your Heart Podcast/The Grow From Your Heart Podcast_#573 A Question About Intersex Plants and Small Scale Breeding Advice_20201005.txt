[01:01.450 --> 01:07.330]  smoking. Today, I've been taking dabs of Melon Smash Live Batter. This is a blend of tangelope
[01:07.330 --> 01:12.490]  and Daywrecker BX. On the package, the flavor is described as melons and fuel. I think I
[01:12.490 --> 01:16.730]  completely agree with that. When I crack open the jar, it is watermelon-y. There's a hint
[01:16.730 --> 01:20.530]  of strawberries coming out of there. Then when I take a dab, I am greeted with that
[01:20.530 --> 01:25.370]  fuel flavor on my tongue. I really do enjoy it. It's got a very pleasant buzz. On the
[01:25.370 --> 01:33.010]  back of the package, it says it contains 67.15% total THC. So big shout out to the Melon Smash
[01:33.010 --> 01:37.490]  Live Batter for keeping me happily medicated through this podcast.
[01:37.490 --> 01:42.210]  All right, this is the part of the show where I do shout outs to the members of the 710
[01:42.210 --> 01:47.970]  Club. Of course, the 710 Club are the folks who support the show on Patreon at the $7.10

[04:26.410 --> 04:30.630]  got the orange gasm logo on it again, not blatantly cannabis, but it does say I read
[04:30.630 --> 04:33.850]  genetics if you're one of those people who wants to support but can't wear a weed themed

[05:06.990 --> 05:10.770]  printed them well make sure their quality shirts as soon as they pass my inspection.
[05:10.770 --> 05:15.650]  Kapow they go up there onto the Etsy store they will be available. So check for those.
[05:15.650 --> 05:19.690]  by the time this episode airs if not 24 hours from the time this episode comes out we will
[05:19.690 --> 05:24.230]  have golden goat t-shirts available. All right. I feel like I've covered a lot of business
[05:24.230 --> 05:29.810]  and a lot of ground here at the start of the show. We did the patreon part we did the shirts.
[05:29.810 --> 05:34.850]  I feel like it is time to jump into the message portion of this podcast. I do have a great
[05:34.850 --> 05:39.250]  question. This one comes from a longtime listener someone who interacts with me quite a bit.
[05:39.250 --> 05:42.410]  It's funny. He said he didn't want to send a message because he's been bugging me a lot.
[05:42.570 --> 05:47.410]  Bro you're never bugging me. I love the interaction. I love the messages. I love the support. Keep
[05:47.410 --> 05:52.050]  sending the questions and responses. I love it. You guys are never bugging me. I love
[05:52.050 --> 05:56.170]  the cannabis questions. I love the community interaction. I do get a lot of messages. So
[05:56.170 --> 06:00.970]  if it takes me a minute to reply I'm not ignoring you. I didn't forget. There are 100 new messages
[06:00.970 --> 06:04.930]  in my inbox and I got to find you but I will get there. The email address is grow from
[06:04.930 --> 06:09.970]  your heart at hotmail dot com. Keep the messages coming. I'm fucking rambly. Let's get to the
[06:09.970 --> 06:14.930]  point. This message goes just like this. It says Hey Ross to Jeff please don't use
[06:14.930 --> 06:18.450]  my real name. I like that a lot when people tell me not to use their real name makes it
[06:18.450 --> 06:22.610]  easy. I know who gets a shout out from this one. I know not to use your name. Let's keep
[06:22.610 --> 06:27.130]  going. It says I've been meaning to write to you since episode 560 to tell you how much
[06:27.130 --> 06:32.290]  I enjoyed hearing you and Mike drop stories and knowledge. You two just bullshitting provided
[06:32.290 --> 06:38.450]  so much information that people like me would never hear and that made 560 a great episode.
[06:38.450 --> 06:42.170]  Hey thanks a lot. That was a fun episode to record. We really went off the rails. We
[06:42.170 --> 06:46.050]  really had a good time. It was just two dudes hanging out. I'm glad you guys appreciate
[06:46.050 --> 06:49.810]  it. It also says my incentive to write was increased because I have a question about
[06:49.810 --> 06:55.570]  something that just happened to me. We've got some firsthand experience inspiring questions.
[06:55.570 --> 06:59.050]  Let's not waste too much time. It goes like this. I don't want to mention the breeder
[06:59.050 --> 07:03.130]  or the seed bank involved. Very classy. Thank you. I would have edited that out anyway but
[07:03.130 --> 07:07.730]  I like your approach. It says I ordered a particular strain from a seed bank which I
[07:07.730 --> 07:13.890]  am sure you are familiar with but does not carry irigenetics. It says my habit is to
[07:13.890 --> 07:19.010]  grow one seed out to learn the plant before I grow more. I'd put this and an orange gasm
[07:19.010 --> 07:25.410]  in a flower tent at the same time. They were the two prettiest girls in the tent. These
[07:25.410 --> 07:30.130]  plants were two and one half weeks into flower so I pulled them out of the tent to give them
[07:30.130 --> 07:36.970]  a close visual inspection. You know just in case. All right so where we are is this listener
[07:37.010 --> 07:41.410]  bought some seeds. They bought a pack of seeds from a vendor that does not carry irigenetics
[07:41.410 --> 07:45.050]  which is just fine. I encourage you to grow more stuff. Of course I want you to buy my
[07:45.050 --> 07:48.490]  seeds and grow them but there are so many things out there. Don't stick with just me.
[07:48.490 --> 07:53.530]  Try more shit. And then also you'll see where things stand. So our friend bought some seeds.
[07:53.530 --> 07:59.050]  They also bought some orange gasm seeds. They grow one seed from a pack at a time. So now
[07:59.050 --> 08:02.430]  they've got an orange gasm seed growing and they've got this other seed growing which
[08:02.430 --> 08:07.910]  we're not going to name. So they are, how are we, two and one half weeks into flower.
[08:07.910 --> 08:12.310]  He's taken his plants out of the tent to take a look just like we're supposed to do. And
[08:12.310 --> 08:15.750]  I already know how this is going to go. It says you've probably guessed by now that I
[08:15.750 --> 08:22.110]  found male pollen sacks growing alongside female flowers on the plant in question. So
[08:22.110 --> 08:27.390]  the plant that is not the orange gasm is showing female flowers on one plant on one bud and
[08:27.390 --> 08:32.990]  male flowers on another. We've got an intersex plant here to showing us two different traits.
[08:32.990 --> 08:38.150]  Let's keep talking about this. It says the orange gasm was fine. So the orange gasm hasn't
[08:38.150 --> 08:43.630]  shown you any intersex or hermaphroditic traits. It is still flowering as a female. It says
[08:43.630 --> 08:49.470]  thankfully no pollen has been released. No pollen that you know of. Don't get too excited
[08:49.470 --> 08:54.730]  yet. Those fuckers go more quickly than we think sometimes. I don't want to fucking burst
[08:54.730 --> 08:57.890]  your bubble, but hopefully, I'm really hoping you got in there early enough, but they go
[08:57.890 --> 09:02.970]  sooner than we expect sometimes. It says it's tough to commit canicide, but that guy gal
[09:02.970 --> 09:07.370]  had to go. Yes, get those the fuck out of there. Don't feel bad at all about committing
[09:07.370 --> 09:13.910]  plant canicide. We are looking for professional athletes. We're looking for high level fucking
[09:13.910 --> 09:17.610]  Olympic athletes and that one was not performing. It couldn't even run around the track. So
[09:17.610 --> 09:22.250]  it had to go. This is an elite club and we are very selective. I'm not afraid to admit
[09:22.250 --> 09:26.570]  that I fucking choose favorites in my garden. That's how it goes. It's okay to do that with
[09:26.570 --> 09:29.650]  plants. We can't do it with people. All right, let's keep moving forward. I'm fucking rambly
[09:29.650 --> 09:35.070]  today. Where are we? So that had to go. The breeder in question had online reviews indicating
[09:35.070 --> 09:39.610]  problems with hermaphrodites. So I contacted the seed bank and after much wrangling, I
[09:39.610 --> 09:45.250]  got some relief. You're very lucky there because a lot of the seed banks, if you say you germinated
[09:45.250 --> 09:48.530]  the seeds, they're going to tell you that those were meant as souvenirs and you can't
[09:48.530 --> 09:52.450]  germinate them anyway. So you fucked up by germinating them and now you're shit out of
[09:52.450 --> 09:57.010]  luck. So you're lucky you got anywhere with that seed bank. Honestly, it says, however,
[09:57.010 --> 10:01.610]  the seed bank blamed me. Of course they did. Of course they did. I'll wait to see exactly
[10:01.610 --> 10:05.810]  what the seller does before I decide if I'm satisfied with its response. Needless to say,
[10:05.810 --> 10:10.490]  I won't grow any more seeds from that pack. Most likely that company is going to blow
[10:10.490 --> 10:14.850]  you off. You did send me details about where this came from that I left out of the show.
[10:14.850 --> 10:17.890]  They are not going to reply to you. They're not going to do shit for you. In my assumption,
[10:17.930 --> 10:21.090]  in my experience, they're going to tell you that it was all your fault to have a good day.
[10:21.090 --> 10:23.930]  They may give you a coupon or something for more seeds, but I don't think you're going
[10:23.930 --> 10:29.490]  to be satisfied with the fix here. That's why I recommend seedsherenow.com 100% satisfaction
[10:29.490 --> 10:33.650]  guarantee. If seeds go wrong that you buy at seeds here now, you send them a message.
[10:33.650 --> 10:37.170]  You say, Hey, these seeds didn't work. They will replace them. Then they will let me know
[10:37.170 --> 10:42.270]  that they had to replace them and then I replaced them. So the only person I cover my mistakes.
[10:42.270 --> 10:45.690]  If your seeds don't work, I cover them to the seed bank. The seed bank covers you. We
[10:45.690 --> 10:48.890]  want to make sure everybody's happy. That's how customer service should work. So let me
[10:48.890 --> 10:52.850]  know if you ever got a problem with iRegenetics seeds, send me an email, iRegenetics at hotmail.com.
[10:52.850 --> 10:56.370]  I'll do my best to help you out. Don't troll me. Don't be a dick. Be polite about it. We'll
[10:56.370 --> 11:00.570]  take care of you. So I really think you're shit out of luck with those seeds that you
[11:00.570 --> 11:05.210]  got, but luckily you were a guy that runs one seed at a time. A lot of people run the
[11:05.210 --> 11:09.570]  whole pack. That could have been a 10 pack or a 12 pack of seeds. Imagine if you run
[11:09.570 --> 11:15.010]  12 of them and found 12 Herms, you would have had 12 times the soil, water, nutrients,
[11:15.010 --> 11:18.730]  space. It would have been compounded by 12. So I'm kind of glad you were a guy that runs
[11:18.730 --> 11:24.410]  one at a time. And if you got one intersex plant out of that batch, so far they are a
[11:24.410 --> 11:28.010]  hundred percent problematic seeds. I can only imagine what's going to come from the other
[11:28.010 --> 11:33.130]  10 or 12 or maybe six. If they were fems, that company sells packs of six fems, I think.
[11:33.130 --> 11:37.330]  So you would have had five more problematic plants on your hands. I need to get myself
[11:37.490 --> 11:42.130]  on track or this podcast is going to end up being like 44 days long. Let's get focused
[11:42.130 --> 11:47.410]  here. It says, so here is my question. These pollen sacks were what I would call genetic
[11:47.410 --> 11:53.810]  Herms as opposed to stress Herms. So he's calling them genetic Hermaphrodites and not
[11:53.810 --> 11:59.770]  stress Hermaphrodites. In my mind, those labels indicate that this is kind of a weird boundary
[11:59.770 --> 12:05.250]  to cross here, kind of a fine line to dance on. But he's saying that he assumes some plants
[12:05.250 --> 12:11.090]  are more genetically prone and poorly selected to be Herms and some are just triggered. That
[12:11.090 --> 12:14.970]  trait was lying in that plant and it would have been brought out. But I'm going to get
[12:14.970 --> 12:18.410]  to that part. Let me just keep talking. It says, am I correct that if pollen sacks develop
[12:18.410 --> 12:23.010]  on a plant side by side with female flowers, that the trait is within the genetics of the
[12:23.010 --> 12:28.770]  strain and not a result of stress? While I did have less than a week of slightly higher
[12:28.770 --> 12:33.450]  tent temperatures during a short heat wave, conditions in the tent were pretty normal.
[12:33.450 --> 12:38.770]  Can you explain the process of hermaphrodism in cannabis, including the difference between
[12:38.770 --> 12:44.970]  what causes male female parts on the same node and what causes anthers to sprout from
[12:44.970 --> 12:52.170]  flowers? Thanks for the benefit of your expertise. I don't know that I am an expert in the category
[12:52.170 --> 12:59.170]  of hermaphroditism or intersex plants. Kind of if I see that, I get rid of the plants.
[12:59.170 --> 13:05.170]  But I do understand what you are asking. Sometimes you will see a plant later in flower
[13:05.170 --> 13:09.610]  start throwing, we call them nanners. They're just single male flowers that pop up in the
[13:09.610 --> 13:16.530]  middle of a bud. I think those are more from stressing a plant. Those are more from problems.
[13:16.530 --> 13:21.650]  I think when your plant produced these male flowers early into flower like that, that
[13:21.650 --> 13:27.130]  is a hermaphroditic plant. Those are probably problematic seeds that were poorly selected.
[13:27.130 --> 13:32.330]  I did reply to our friend here. He signed it with, this is from used to be cool. There
[13:32.330 --> 13:35.410]  we go. He did sign it from used to be cool. He signed it with used to be cool. If I just
[13:35.410 --> 13:39.490]  showed your name on the screen, I will block that out because I held up your email. I did
[13:39.490 --> 13:44.610]  reply to used to be cool and I said, hey, I think both of those examples are predetermined
[13:44.610 --> 13:50.090]  traits in the plant, a lot like color and structure. That hermaphroditism is a trait
[13:50.090 --> 13:55.250]  within that plant. It is a trait just like the smell of the plant, just like the growth.
[13:55.250 --> 13:59.570]  Maybe it's really good with PM. Maybe it's not. Also, maybe it's got intersex. That's
[13:59.570 --> 14:05.570]  just an alien, which this plant carries. So I said, we provide the environmental situation
[14:05.570 --> 14:11.850]  to trigger that expression. So that plant held that intersex trait. We had to give it
[14:11.850 --> 14:16.290]  the environment to bring that intersex trait out. Just like a lot of times you can make
[14:16.290 --> 14:20.130]  some plants turn cold or turn purple. If you get them cold, that's a trait we can bring
[14:20.130 --> 14:25.750]  out through environmental factors. Density is a lot determined by environmental factors.
[14:25.750 --> 14:30.050]  We can get airy buds or we can get dense buds from the same plant based on the environment.
[14:30.050 --> 14:35.650]  So we're giving it the situation to express different things. If I put you, I'm trying
[14:35.650 --> 14:39.530]  to think of different situations I can put you in. If I put you near a bunch of junk
[14:39.530 --> 14:43.250]  food all the time and make you watch crap TV, you're going to turn into a junk food
[14:43.250 --> 14:47.690]  eating crap minded person. If I give you health food and healthy things to do all day, you'll
[14:47.690 --> 14:51.370]  become a healthy person who's physically fit with a strong, healthy mind. That is a
[14:51.370 --> 14:55.810]  product of your environment. That is how you express your environment. Plants do the same
[14:55.810 --> 15:01.290]  thing. I'm trying to stay on track and also give good examples. So these plants were given
[15:01.290 --> 15:07.090]  the environment to show hermaphroditism. And I'm getting off track of what I wrote here.
[15:07.090 --> 15:09.850]  Let me keep going with what I wrote. I said a breeder should be testing his seeds before
[15:09.850 --> 15:15.450]  releasing them. I think what you got was poor breeding and untested seeds that were prone
[15:15.450 --> 15:23.330]  to intersex traits. Poorly selected parent stock for fens will make hermaphroditic offspring.
[15:23.330 --> 15:27.370]  That's not the word I wrote here, but I says plants that flip from major stress are more
[15:27.370 --> 15:33.370]  common because cannabis wants to survive and will reproduce. So if you leave most cannabis
[15:33.370 --> 15:38.330]  plants growing for too long, they will find a way to reproduce. They will start throwing
[15:38.330 --> 15:43.610]  off very few hermaphroditic male flowers or male flowers, not even hermaphroditic flowers.
[15:43.610 --> 15:47.930]  It will be male flowers. They'll start throwing those off. The idea of this plant is nobody's
[15:47.930 --> 15:51.210]  going to pick me. No one's going to pollinate me. I'll fucking self pollinate myself so
[15:51.210 --> 15:56.010]  I can survive. That's cannabis's whole goal. It wants to make seeds so it can grow again
[15:56.010 --> 16:00.690]  next year so it can make seeds and grow again next year. So I'm going to try to get myself
[16:00.690 --> 16:06.490]  back where I was here. The plants want to survive. So that hint of hermaphroditism is
[16:06.490 --> 16:12.930]  in a lot of plants. Breeders should be selecting plants more carefully to where we don't have
[16:12.970 --> 16:18.370]  such likelihood for hermaphroditism in the offspring. I think what this guy got, what
[16:18.370 --> 16:23.890]  used to be cool got was just poorly bred, untested, untried and true genetics. These
[16:23.890 --> 16:28.250]  genetics should have been test grown. If they showed hermaphroditism, if they showed intersex
[16:28.250 --> 16:32.850]  traits two and a half weeks into flower like that, the breeder should have seen that. One
[16:32.850 --> 16:37.210]  of yours did it. A hundred percent of yours did it. That means a few of his had to have
[16:37.210 --> 16:40.370]  done it and he should have seen that and he should have said, these are shit. I should
[16:40.370 --> 16:44.050]  not sell these to anybody. I need to grow these myself and find some gems or give them
[16:44.050 --> 16:47.290]  to my friends and warn them that these are bullshit, but they should not have gone to
[16:47.290 --> 16:51.650]  market. No vendor, no retailer should have ever gotten their hands on these. That was
[16:51.650 --> 16:57.210]  poor practices, bad customer service, bad selection, bad ethics, bad breeding. That's
[16:57.210 --> 17:02.690]  fucked up is what that is. So that should have been removed from the gene pool. Now
[17:02.690 --> 17:06.050]  this guy is passing on hermaphroditic seeds. A bunch of people are going to buy these seeds.
[17:06.050 --> 17:08.930]  They're going to spend money. They're going to be pissed off. I'm getting way off track.
[17:08.930 --> 17:16.210]  It says balls and pistols on the same branch show obvious intersex traits. A few nanners
[17:16.210 --> 17:20.650]  and a mostly looking female is more likely a grower issue. So if you're causing the plant
[17:20.650 --> 17:25.110]  to hermaphrodite and it's just spitting out a couple of male flowers, that is probably
[17:25.110 --> 17:29.590]  a light leak, some sort of stress. But if it's showing straight up balls and female
[17:29.590 --> 17:34.210]  flowers on the same plant, that was a poorly selected breeding project. It should have
[17:34.210 --> 17:38.470]  been eliminated. It should have been scrapped. Then I wrapped my message up with, I'm high
[17:38.510 --> 17:42.710]  as shit. So I hope this makes sense. Yeah. Sometimes you guys, I'm answering messages
[17:42.710 --> 17:48.390]  at three in the morning and I'm high as shit. So mainly that should have been found in test
[17:48.390 --> 17:52.730]  batches and you should not have been sold those seeds. I don't think any of that hermaphroditism
[17:52.730 --> 17:57.550]  was your fault. Since you've got another plant in there, the orange chasm didn't show you
[17:57.550 --> 18:03.030]  any problems. That's an indicator that that was a problem with the genetics and not your
[18:03.030 --> 18:07.190]  fault. All right. I hope I rambled right through your question. I hope I gave you some useful
[18:07.190 --> 18:11.670]  advice. I do appreciate all of the interaction with you, brother. And I look forward to hearing
[18:11.670 --> 18:16.670]  your reply to my reply. All right. I want to keep moving. I do have a screenshot in
[18:16.670 --> 18:20.870]  my phone from another message. Somebody sent me a message on, I don't remember if this
[18:20.870 --> 18:25.150]  came from YouTube or Cannabuzz, but my phone will tell me if I quit stumbling and get right
[18:25.150 --> 18:29.930]  to it. All right. This one is from Cannabuzz and it says, Hey Ross to Jeff. I just discovered
[18:29.930 --> 18:35.250]  your show via the DGC. Shout out to my friends at the Dude Grow Show. Our new friend found
[18:35.250 --> 18:39.490]  us through the Dude Grow Show. So thank you for finding me from the DGC. It says, you
[18:39.490 --> 18:44.730]  mentioned you are limited to a low plant count at home. Yes, I'm in Colorado. Our plant count
[18:44.730 --> 18:50.570]  here, it is a six plant per person cap for recreational cannabis. However, I do have
[18:50.570 --> 18:55.850]  a medical cannabis card, which allows me six more plants. So I'm now allowed 12 plants
[18:55.850 --> 19:00.010]  in my personal grow. That's what I'm allowed to have because of the state of Colorado.
[19:00.010 --> 19:05.270]  So that does limit me very low to breeding. I've got 12 plants I'm allowed to work with.
[19:05.270 --> 19:09.850]  This goes on and says, could you talk about the logistics of breeding at home with a low
[19:09.850 --> 19:15.490]  plant count? Yes, that is something I could definitely elaborate on. The difference between
[19:15.490 --> 19:20.650]  breeding in a bigger facility and breeding in a smaller facility is definitely smaller
[19:20.650 --> 19:27.130]  batches, smaller scales, which means more focus. I'm only allowed 12 plants. So if you
[19:27.130 --> 19:31.330]  really want to think about it, how many mom plants do I keep? And then how many plants
[19:31.330 --> 19:34.770]  do I put in the veg room? And then I need a male plant also, or how many plants do I
[19:34.770 --> 19:39.730]  put into the flower room? So I've got mother plants, veg plants, flower plants, and a male
[19:39.730 --> 19:45.410]  plant and hopefully backups or clones of whatever I'm working with. So I've got to be really,
[19:45.410 --> 19:49.410]  really selective of what I'm using and what I'm going to breed with and what makes and
[19:49.410 --> 19:54.370]  doesn't make the cut to stay in my stable. So if you want to breed on a very small scale
[19:54.490 --> 19:58.250]  because of plant counts, you need to focus on your goals. You can't have any plants that
[19:58.250 --> 20:03.250]  aren't winners, aren't champions, aren't potential breeders. You've got to have nothing but winners
[20:03.250 --> 20:08.770]  in there. All right, so let's use my 12 plant state legal count to do a little breeding
[20:08.770 --> 20:12.770]  project. We've got a couple of options when it comes to breeding. Do you want to breed
[20:12.770 --> 20:17.510]  one plant to one plant? Do you want to breed one male plant to a bunch of female plants?
[20:17.510 --> 20:22.090]  Do you want to breed a reversed female to other females? What is your ultimate goal?
[20:22.090 --> 20:25.910]  That's going to be a lot of the decision making when it comes to logistics of breeding
[20:25.910 --> 20:32.010]  at home. Since I run a commercial seed breeding company, I like to make multiple strains at
[20:32.010 --> 20:37.570]  one time. So I usually put King Solomon, my popular male in the room with several females
[20:37.570 --> 20:41.530]  so that he can hit the strawberry fields, the platinum tangy, the blueberry cookies,
[20:41.530 --> 20:45.610]  and then we can make, what do we make there? We make a sun kiss, we make strawberry fields
[20:45.610 --> 20:49.310]  and we make blue raspberry truffle out of those. I'll put the morning dew or the grateful
[20:49.310 --> 20:53.190]  dog in there so we can make morning dew. I'll put an arise female in there so we can
[20:53.190 --> 20:57.650]  make a rise F2 seeds. Then maybe when you're not looking, I'll sneak something brand new
[20:57.650 --> 21:02.190]  in there so I can make a brand new cross. So I've got a bunch of the old trusty, reliable
[21:02.190 --> 21:06.910]  stuff to restock the stores. Then also I've got a brand new thing to send out to my testers.
[21:06.910 --> 21:12.830]  I can build more hype, keep stuff going while I'm doing productivity. So since I make commercial
[21:12.830 --> 21:17.790]  production, I'm putting a male in there with five or six tried and true females. That boy
[21:17.790 --> 21:22.750]  hits those girls. Then I make a batch of five or six different crosses. Then I harvest
[21:22.750 --> 21:27.510]  those. They're ready to go. The thing I have to think about is I've got a certain amount
[21:27.510 --> 21:32.810]  of mother plants. I know which genetics I want to keep. So I select a few of those.
[21:32.810 --> 21:36.830]  Those plants are now eating up part of my plant count. So King Solomon is always around.
[21:36.830 --> 21:41.910]  He's always eating up part of my plant count. Strawberry fields. What is the other one?
[21:41.910 --> 21:45.590]  Platinum tangy, blueberry cookies. Those are eating up part of my plant count. So those
[21:45.590 --> 21:49.510]  are there. Those are going to get cloned off of, or they're going to get dragged into
[21:49.510 --> 21:54.470]  the flower room with the male plant. Now my issue is I need to keep those plants around
[21:54.470 --> 21:58.430]  because I want to breed with them again in the future. So now I've got to take a clone
[21:58.430 --> 22:02.990]  of them. Those clones are starting to eat up my plant count. So what I've got to do
[22:02.990 --> 22:06.910]  is carefully think about how many mother plants I'm going to keep, how many plants I'm going
[22:06.910 --> 22:10.550]  to throw into the breeding room, then how I'm going to keep clones of those to keep
[22:10.550 --> 22:16.210]  them for preservation. It is a really nice balance and a really nice juggle. Luckily,
[22:16.210 --> 22:20.230]  I do have other places where I can store mother plants. I've got friends that I can rely on
[22:20.230 --> 22:23.830]  that will keep genetics for me. They've just got a mother plant of certain things where
[22:23.830 --> 22:26.950]  if I want to breed with that, I just call them up and I say, Hey, I'm going to need
[22:26.950 --> 22:31.110]  six clones of this plant in this many days. Can you get them going for me? And they take
[22:31.110 --> 22:34.750]  12 clones and I go pick my favorite six and they get to run the other six. And that's
[22:34.750 --> 22:40.430]  how we make sure that genetics stay alive. I've got some really trustworthy friends
[22:40.470 --> 22:44.470]  who have got some really good genetics fucking stashed away for me, or I wouldn't be able
[22:44.470 --> 22:49.670]  to do a lot of the projects that I do. So you've got to be able to keep your mother
[22:49.670 --> 22:53.310]  plants. You've got to have veg plants that will eventually become flower plants and you
[22:53.310 --> 22:59.670]  need clones to keep preservation of your stuff. Another thing you can do is you can re-veg.
[22:59.670 --> 23:04.150]  If you don't have the numbers, you can re-veg. This is going to sound crazy to a new breeder,
[23:04.150 --> 23:08.310]  but this is something that is completely possible. I've done it. I can show you the seeds. I
[23:08.470 --> 23:13.230]  can show you the mother plant. I've got proof. So here's what I've done. I took a plant,
[23:13.230 --> 23:19.230]  I put it into flower for 18 days and I pollinated it. I let that fucker sit for about five days
[23:19.230 --> 23:25.510]  with pollen in it. Then I put it back into the veg room under 18 six. What I know, right?
[23:25.510 --> 23:30.350]  My plant is pregnant and now I'm putting it back in veg. Slowly over time, that plant
[23:30.350 --> 23:36.830]  went back into a vegetative stage. Also the seeds inside of that plant kept maturing because
[23:36.950 --> 23:40.550]  that plant didn't care if it was in flower or if it was in veg, it was already pregnant
[23:40.550 --> 23:46.430]  and it was going to make seeds. So my plant is in the veg room making seeds. About six
[23:46.430 --> 23:51.390]  or seven weeks into that process, I harvested all of the seeds from that plant. As I did
[23:51.390 --> 23:56.350]  so, I left a bunch of those new shoots that grew out because the plant was fully re-vegging.
[23:56.350 --> 24:00.870]  So I just left those shoots that were growing out and that plant is now completely in re-veg
[24:00.870 --> 24:06.350]  and has given me fresh clones. So I put a plant into flower. I pollinated it. I moved
[24:06.350 --> 24:11.470]  that plant back into a veg room. I harvested that plant for all of its seeds. That plant
[24:11.470 --> 24:15.870]  is now a mother plant that has been giving me clones, which are now back into the flower
[24:15.870 --> 24:21.150]  room being pollinated all over again. I was able to pollinate my plant, harvest seeds
[24:21.150 --> 24:26.470]  from it, preserve the genetics and create more clones from the same plant. And once
[24:26.470 --> 24:30.870]  this plant grows out big enough, I will put it back in the flower room and pollinate it
[24:30.870 --> 24:34.870]  one more time because I've got a clone from it and I've got a keeper. And I just want
[24:34.870 --> 24:38.470]  to say that I've seeded that plant multiple times and pulled harvest from it because it's
[24:38.470 --> 24:45.630]  fun. So that is a way to preserve your genetics. The main struggle I have is preserving my
[24:45.630 --> 24:49.350]  genetics. I want to keep all of my plants here. They're like my babies. They're my kids.
[24:49.350 --> 24:52.870]  They're honestly my business and my livelihood. I want to keep my eyes on them, but I can't
[24:52.870 --> 24:57.430]  do it because I have to let my other trustworthy friends keep my veg plants around for me,
[24:57.430 --> 25:01.750]  my mother plants around because I don't have the legal space. They don't want to grow.
[25:01.750 --> 25:05.410]  They don't have a use for it. So I help them out in certain ways and they help me out by
[25:05.410 --> 25:10.150]  keeping my plants around. So that is one way for preservation. That's another way to do
[25:10.150 --> 25:17.530]  it. Let me get myself on track here. One thing that low numbers really helps is with focus.
[25:17.530 --> 25:21.310]  If I were unlimited, my breeding would be crazy. I wouldn't be focused. I like the tight
[25:21.310 --> 25:26.070]  focus that it gives me. I'm only allowed so many plants. I can't go too far. So it keeps
[25:26.070 --> 25:31.830]  me really focused on having nothing but elite winners in my lineup. The problem is I have
[25:31.830 --> 25:36.110]  a hard time testing because now I'm limited to so many plants. So if I keep six moms,
[25:36.110 --> 25:40.510]  I can run six seeds. So I've got to find the boys and the girls out of those and cull those.
[25:40.510 --> 25:44.950]  Oh, that's a struggle. Now let's talk a little bit about pheno hunting because if you're
[25:44.950 --> 25:49.810]  breeding, you're going to be pheno hunting to find the keepers from your crosses. A lot
[25:49.810 --> 25:54.190]  of people like to do large pheno hunts, but when you're minimized by legal plant counts,
[25:54.190 --> 25:58.910]  you can only run 12 at a time. What's to stop you from running 10 right now, picking
[25:58.910 --> 26:03.510]  the best and then running nine right next to it next time and pick the best out of that
[26:03.510 --> 26:08.110]  batch. If it's the one from before or a new one, just keep picking the best one every
[26:08.110 --> 26:14.070]  time. Run 10 seeds, find the alpha fucking female. Run 10 more, run nine more seeds and
[26:14.070 --> 26:18.190]  that one next to it and compare that one to all of them. Find the best one out of it.
[26:18.190 --> 26:22.750]  Do it until you're satisfied and you know that you have got the gem, the female plant
[26:22.750 --> 26:27.950]  that you want. Do that for your male plant also. You don't have to run large batches.
[26:27.950 --> 26:31.090]  I said batches. I don't know why I said it that way, but you don't have to run large
[26:31.090 --> 26:37.790]  batches and populations to pheno hunt if you're limited by numbers. If you do 10 seed pheno
[26:37.790 --> 26:42.310]  hunts, you've ran a hundred seeds, it's going to take you a little bit more time. But in
[26:42.310 --> 26:46.570]  that more time, you're only paying attention to 10 plants at a time. You can really focus
[26:46.570 --> 26:50.650]  and pay attention to each one. Like I said a moment ago, unlimited numbers makes it hard
[26:50.650 --> 26:54.450]  to pay attention to everything. Like if you've got a hundred kids running around, how do
[26:54.450 --> 26:57.450]  you remember all a hundred of their names? If you've got 10 kids, you can remember all
[26:57.450 --> 27:00.730]  10 of their names. Because I feel like I need to fucking dab mid show, but I'm not going
[27:00.730 --> 27:05.830]  to press pause and take a dab. We're just going to keep going. So you have got to manage
[27:05.830 --> 27:09.970]  how you keep your genetics. You've got to focus in. Something that will be really nice
[27:09.970 --> 27:13.610]  if you're trapped in a small grow is you won't get super huge with all of your ideas and
[27:13.610 --> 27:18.730]  creations. You may be able to focus in and make further filial generations instead of
[27:18.730 --> 27:23.450]  just making new crosses. Make a batch of seeds, keep the male and female around, use
[27:23.450 --> 27:27.950]  the rest of your count to plant however many seeds you've got left. If you take a male
[27:27.950 --> 27:31.930]  plant and a female plant, cross those, make seeds. Whatever your plant count is, you've
[27:31.930 --> 27:35.690]  got two off your count now, fill the rest of that count up with seeds that you just
[27:35.690 --> 27:40.110]  made. Grow those seeds out. If you want to breed again, find the best male and the best
[27:40.110 --> 27:44.450]  female and keep those. Now may be a time to decide if you want the original male and female
[27:44.450 --> 27:48.570]  around or if it's time to get rid of them. Keep that new male and that new female, breed
[27:48.570 --> 27:53.450]  those together. Now you've got the F2s, now you've got F2s to play with. You can fucking
[27:53.450 --> 27:57.050]  find the male and female out of there and keep going and keep getting rid of the old
[27:57.050 --> 28:02.230]  parents as you go. Or you can add new shit to the mix. As long as you keep preservation
[28:02.230 --> 28:07.310]  of your old genetics in a clone form or give them to your buddy or learn how to re-veg,
[28:07.310 --> 28:10.970]  you can continue your breeding projects. All right, so I did say that I was going to talk
[28:10.970 --> 28:15.010]  about my 12-plant breeding program and I keep getting sidetracked. Let's focus in a little
[28:15.010 --> 28:20.170]  bit on my 12-plant breeding project. I'm allowed to have six plants in flower and six
[28:20.170 --> 28:24.950]  plants in veg. So I try to get six plants that I know I'm going to breed with from my
[28:24.950 --> 28:29.650]  friends that house my genetics. I put those into the flower room and I get them going.
[28:29.650 --> 28:34.490]  I put the male in there about 10 to 14 days before the girls. I get him started. I move
[28:34.490 --> 28:39.190]  him way over to the corner. Then I put the five females in there and I get them going.
[28:39.190 --> 28:43.210]  And then when it's pollen time, I shake that dude and I cut him down. So now I've got five
[28:43.210 --> 28:48.690]  in one room. That leaves me seven other plants to play with. I've got six in the veg room
[28:48.690 --> 28:53.370]  already vegging. So they're about 30 days behind my flower room so that every fucking
[28:53.370 --> 28:58.190]  60 days I get to clean up the flower room, spray it down, rebuild a little bit of stuff,
[28:58.190 --> 29:02.610]  put in new filters, put in new shit and drag new plants in there. I never miss a day if
[29:02.610 --> 29:07.250]  I'm on track, if I'm on cycle, if things went according to plan. Sometimes plants take a
[29:07.250 --> 29:10.450]  little bit longer for the plants to harden up. So if I've got a new cross that I've been
[29:10.450 --> 29:14.370]  playing with, I may have to wait a couple of weeks for that one plant to finish up before
[29:14.370 --> 29:18.730]  I could put new plants back into the flower room. But generally, I've got half of the
[29:18.730 --> 29:22.490]  room filled with plants that are pollinated and getting finished. And then I've got a
[29:22.490 --> 29:26.450]  veg room that is filled with the other half of my plant count that are vegging out getting
[29:26.450 --> 29:30.250]  popped and twisted and cleaned up so that when it is flower time, they are nice and
[29:30.250 --> 29:34.410]  ready. As soon as I harvest I clean up make sure all the pollen is out of the room, put
[29:34.410 --> 29:38.650]  more plants in there. And then we get more veg plants and we start growing them up about
[29:38.650 --> 29:44.050]  1430 days into that depending on what I'm going to grow. The main thing is just always
[29:44.050 --> 29:48.490]  have a plan always know where the next plants are coming from always have some clones prepared.
[29:48.490 --> 29:52.530]  If I wasn't blessed enough to have some friends helping me out, I would probably have to reduce
[29:52.530 --> 29:58.050]  my plants to four plants in the bedroom, four in the mother room and four and flower which
[29:58.050 --> 30:02.910]  would be my 12 plant count. So I would have dedicated mother plants, I'd have three females
[30:02.910 --> 30:07.490]  and a male and I would take a clone off of those, those would go into the veg room, then
[30:07.490 --> 30:11.450]  they would go into the flower room and I would always have four moms for veggies and
[30:11.450 --> 30:15.810]  four flowers and how I would work that. So I'd have to be really strategic with that.
[30:15.810 --> 30:21.170]  That means that I would have one boy plant and three female plants to work with or four
[30:21.170 --> 30:26.810]  females and I could just take turns just reversing them and pollinating them. However many combinations
[30:26.810 --> 30:32.930]  that would give me is that 16 or is that 32? Or is it 64? I don't know, dude, but there's
[30:32.930 --> 30:36.330]  some math to be involved in there. It's four times four times four, it's four times the
[30:36.330 --> 30:42.130]  amount of opportunities you've got. So that's a lot of four times fours. We're way off track
[30:42.130 --> 30:47.210]  today. All right. So since I am a commercial breeder and I'm breeding for multiple strains,
[30:47.210 --> 30:50.890]  that is how I would do it. If you are a personal breeder and you're just trying to breed for
[30:50.890 --> 30:56.290]  one project, I would recommend having a male and maybe one or two females to work with
[30:56.290 --> 31:00.750]  instead of making a bunch of new crosses, work on furthering that line, make that filial
[31:00.750 --> 31:05.850]  generation all the way to like F5 or F6 where you can dial in the exact traits that you
[31:05.850 --> 31:10.530]  want. Another fun thing to do is work two lines work one line for smell, work one line
[31:10.530 --> 31:15.290]  for potency, work them both to about F4 or five and then breed those together and then
[31:15.290 --> 31:20.010]  you get the potency and flavor you were looking for. That's a really fun way to do it. Take
[31:20.010 --> 31:24.490]  the A line and the B line of two of the same crosses work them for different traits and
[31:24.490 --> 31:27.970]  then breed those together in the end. That's something a lot of people are overlooking
[31:27.970 --> 31:31.970]  and forgetting about that's when breeding gets really fun. So I've been rambling for
[31:31.970 --> 31:36.610]  a long time. I hope I answered your question about small scale breeding at home. Mainly
[31:36.610 --> 31:41.610]  focus on keeping the genetics you you want to breed that shit again. So have the genetics
[31:41.610 --> 31:45.850]  then leave yourself some room for veg plants and flowering plants. And then also you may
[31:45.850 --> 31:50.210]  need to eliminate plants in the future so that you can sprout some of the seeds that
[31:50.210 --> 31:54.090]  you have produced. It's always a challenge testing your new stuff because we just want
[31:54.090 --> 31:58.370]  to sprout 100 of them. And that's when we start getting in trouble. So I hope I answered
[31:58.370 --> 32:01.970]  your question. If you've got any more questions, I do look forward to hearing from you. You
