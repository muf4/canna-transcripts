[02:49.520 --> 02:54.960]  You didn't know you know my voice had voices like that's like true that's like true sirens of the 710
[02:54.960 --> 02:56.960]  I'm kind of turned on you know
[02:59.160 --> 03:04.120]  I did not want it to stop at all ever the only thing we want to stop and we could do that for about four
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.840]  Hours, and we have done it before the outro for four hours. We'll just get that
[03:11.640 --> 03:13.640]  Special
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.880]  I will say before we get off topic we do want to make sure we say
[03:28.880 --> 03:31.760]  The No-No Nebraska like the Nebraska needs to stop
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.320]  Stop making no mountain. Yeah, it's not about the no melt. It's about the melt get back on the J Mike. Thank you
[03:41.080 --> 03:43.920]  We're gonna need to make a glossary of terms to go with the podcast
[03:43.920 --> 03:45.800]  But if you're not with it, you're not with it today guys
[03:45.800 --> 03:49.320]  So basically let me explain what no mountain Nebraska is let's start it off with that
[03:49.320 --> 03:52.800]  Let's introduce you before you explain ladies and gentlemen speaking on the mic right now
[03:52.800 --> 03:56.000]  That is about to give us a lesson in no melt Nebraska is Jordan from turpex
[03:56.400 --> 04:02.240]  About turpex you got to find out I have been dabbing mad turpex for the past two or three weeks and
[04:02.840 --> 04:08.040]  Turpex has put a smile on my face. I just dabbed some chem dog nectar. I'm lit up so alright here
[04:08.040 --> 04:11.440]  I'm gonna turn it back over to Jordan no brawl. No melt Nebraska. Let's hear it again, okay?
[04:11.440 --> 04:19.600]  So no mountain Nebraska is basically any hash that doesn't melt essentially you know what I mean because basically if you were
[04:20.400 --> 04:22.400]  making hash in
[04:22.960 --> 04:24.960]  Nebraska
[04:24.960 --> 04:30.960]  Most of it would probably not be very good. I think it was just we're thinking. Where's the state that has the least melty hash?
[04:30.960 --> 04:33.120]  Yeah, I think that that is exactly where it came from
[04:34.320 --> 04:36.000]  Nebraska
[04:36.000 --> 04:42.320]  It's about the hash that doesn't melt you just call Nebraska and then the song was derived when my friend Jordan here came home
[04:42.320 --> 04:44.320]  with a bunch of
[04:46.560 --> 04:48.560]  Had somebody come down
[04:49.040 --> 04:56.120]  Back when we lived in Northern, California came down from Mendocino was talking for weeks about this awesome amazing
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.420]  Granddaddy purple hash that he was gonna be bringing down and let me tell you when he brought that down
[05:02.600 --> 05:05.080]  Turn into turned into straight biscuits on
[05:07.720 --> 05:11.560]  Instead of getting a bubble you just get nothing really happens
[05:11.560 --> 05:13.560]  I
[05:16.120 --> 05:20.080]  Like brown you don't really get any smoke in the piece or anything you're just like
[05:20.600 --> 05:25.920]  The face I'm making does not convey on radio at all, but I'm making this fate like if you've ever smelled burnt hair
[05:25.920 --> 05:29.680]  I'm making the face that happens when you smell burnt hair our buddy John John has walked in
[05:36.960 --> 05:38.960]  Fucking love this group of people
[05:38.960 --> 05:46.520]  I've got a dad for you over here. Also after you take double dabbing that full melt dab or mostly melt dab kind of melt
[05:46.520 --> 05:47.040]  Yeah
[05:47.040 --> 05:49.080]  There's any I will say this for everybody, you know

[13:14.900 --> 13:19.580]  Like a wook would you know you get that burn on your finger. Yeah, go stick that sucker in some
[13:19.860 --> 13:23.380]  You need a nail here's a here's a rig for you shout out to the mad Rob rig
[13:23.900 --> 13:27.660]  Yes for a dab a minute ago, and I just shine John says talking. Yeah, you're just like you know
[13:30.980 --> 13:34.460]  When you're good when you say something worth it, I'll give you a dad like a reward you're a good dog
[13:34.980 --> 13:37.380]  But yeah, I mean it's um if you go to the website
[13:37.380 --> 13:39.380]  You know follow us on instagram at at grammy Gatsby
[13:39.460 --> 13:45.200]  But it's a just a gigantic network of people much like Irie and turpex and everything else that we do
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.020]  It's you know trying to be as community based and making sure people are getting forward and being positive
[13:49.020 --> 13:51.020]  And there's tons of brands
[13:51.020 --> 13:54.380]  I mean the guys that are in the room are probably the most important ones because this is how we all make it happen
[13:54.380 --> 13:57.080]  Nice that bread that bread that bread
[14:02.380 --> 14:06.020]  Can we talk about the key does anybody know about the key yeah, we can talk about the key yeah
[14:06.020 --> 14:11.780]  Tell me about the key 2010 I started grammy Gatsby in Aspen, and we only have about
[14:12.860 --> 14:15.420]  2,500 locals and aspen something maybe 3,000 now
[14:15.420 --> 14:18.500]  I don't know I've left since then but uh in Aspen
[14:18.500 --> 14:22.980]  It was this thing where like all these people always had parties and cool shit happening and for grammy Gatsby
[14:22.980 --> 14:26.960]  I wanted to be something special so we would throw a party every week called Gatsby's garden shout out
[14:26.960 --> 14:28.960]  You know big up all the row
[14:28.960 --> 14:35.180]  But we would do Gatsby's garden every Tuesday at a revolving bar and the people that were like truly homies and people that like were
[14:35.260 --> 14:40.020]  Respected we would hook them up with the skull key open your parchment right by the way. I do it right by the bike
[14:40.980 --> 14:44.500]  But we know we had this skull key made that we got like 3,000 skull keys
[14:44.500 --> 14:47.380]  And so a lot of the guys in the room all have one of the skull key
[14:47.380 --> 14:52.340]  But the thought was is that you know the skull key opens up every single door in the Gatsby mansion allows you to go to
[14:52.340 --> 14:57.320]  All the parties so initially it was started that the bouncers and Aspen if you show them the key wouldn't check your ID or make
[14:57.320 --> 15:03.020]  You stand in line so our parties were you know instantly a little bit more hoity-toity for the locals because they could just walk right in
[15:03.020 --> 15:08.380]  And shine off in front of people since then it's now involved in the you know people all over the world have this little skull

[19:06.580 --> 19:10.020]  I was about to look at you and be like are you gonna throw out a Bangladesh accent?
[19:10.020 --> 19:13.460]  I did not know how that would happen. I was going to but it was just gonna sound like an Indian
[19:14.340 --> 19:16.340]  That's racist
[19:17.180 --> 19:19.180]  Racist just by
[19:23.060 --> 19:25.060]  We just run a labor camp and
[19:25.780 --> 19:30.100]  We're talking about social media. So right. How many how many social media is the Grammy Gatsby have?
[19:32.220 --> 19:38.900]  We're probably like 3500 or something like that and we run about 10 different accounts for other people as well that are probably
[19:39.140 --> 19:40.820]  Way larger than we are Wow
[19:40.820 --> 19:43.980]  But yeah, I mean you want to look at like it's just like having a website or anything else
[19:43.980 --> 19:47.260]  Like you got to have you know content is king as they say and it's quality and consistency
[19:47.940 --> 19:50.220]  You want to have the right branding you want to have your shit together?
[19:50.460 --> 19:53.780]  You're not trying to put up pictures of brick walls or other kinds of you know
[19:54.700 --> 19:58.860]  Or all kinds of weird things like you really want to have it together so that it actually looks like what the brand needs to
[19:58.860 --> 20:01.420]  Be like and then that way you can expose it and I you know
[20:01.420 --> 20:02.940]  I will tell you the one thing that I've learned
[20:02.940 --> 20:08.620]  Over the years doing it often is that your audience needs to be able to watch your story like how you said, you know
[20:08.620 --> 20:12.540]  You blew up on Instagram or how these guys have gone from you know, Santa Cruz to Colorado
[20:12.540 --> 20:15.020]  So they want to be a part of that experience
[20:15.020 --> 20:20.220]  I knew of turpex before they ever had a Colorado presence because of their cup winnings and Instagram stuff
[20:20.580 --> 20:22.580]  Shout out to her backs. Yeah
[20:25.140 --> 20:29.860]  Speaking of turpex somebody just passed a rig to me and I've got a big chunk of Kim dog here
[20:29.860 --> 20:35.060]  So I'm gonna do this. Let's uh, what other topics did I opened I brought
[20:36.060 --> 20:40.140]  No, I got all choked up I'm I brought a bottle of dr. Pepper into the room and
[20:40.740 --> 20:46.260]  Hunt he's doing it again. He's like collapsing with with wilt. What's going on, bro? What's with the dr. Pepper?
[20:46.260 --> 20:49.620]  But this is something I will let some of the other guys in the room talk about first
[20:49.620 --> 20:53.900]  But there's I don't drink alcohol. I don't do a lot of things, but there's one thing about 23 flavors
[20:53.900 --> 20:55.900]  That makes me get a chubby
[20:55.900 --> 20:57.900]  I'm saying bro
[20:58.220 --> 21:02.940]  First moved out here in that hunt this guy pretty much most every time I saw him
[21:02.940 --> 21:06.060]  He had a dr. Pepper and one of his hands, but then yeah, you know
[21:06.060 --> 21:10.460]  He had to start getting all healthy and everything like that. He's eating kale salads
[21:11.100 --> 21:13.860]  He actually got me on it, too. You know what I'm saying? And
[21:14.620 --> 21:17.420]  You know, we put the dr. Peppers away for a while
[21:17.420 --> 21:22.300]  So it's just hard for him to sit here at this table and watch you enjoy jelly beans lip balm
[21:22.780 --> 21:26.300]  Fucking drinks they make all kinds of stuff with the 23 flavor turtle
[21:27.580 --> 21:30.460]  Anybody see that perfection left-handed bro lefty shot
[21:31.980 --> 21:33.980]  Okay, well, thanks
[21:35.900 --> 21:40.940]  Julie you've looked at my bottle a couple times. I can even it's like orange cookies. I can just smell it and be happy
[21:40.940 --> 21:42.940]  How long has it been?
[21:43.420 --> 21:45.420]  Probably like a week. Oh, that's all
[21:46.780 --> 21:49.140]  I'm being honest. Yeah, I've cheated bro
[21:49.140 --> 21:52.100]  I'm sitting up there. There's something about the 23 trips. I can't even smoke

[22:20.020 --> 22:22.020]  On hashtag fueled by sonic
[22:22.100 --> 22:24.820]  Fueled by sonic fueled by jaw fueled by street tacos
[22:24.900 --> 22:27.940]  No, but that 23 flavored things is like a nice easy topic to get into though
[22:28.020 --> 22:30.980]  Because yeah get your nail all fired up because we got to talk about turps. Anyways
[22:31.060 --> 22:33.780]  Yeah, I was like that's the next uh topic because I was gonna give turp

[25:19.460 --> 25:22.180]  Months to try to get it ready and the best story about that one
[25:22.420 --> 25:25.220]  I told the boys but uh when I got my picture taken at the med
[25:25.940 --> 25:29.300]  The little lady that works the computer literally looked at me and she was like how long?
[25:30.020 --> 25:32.500]  I was like it's not like a couple months. She's like can I touch it?
[25:33.300 --> 25:40.040]  Unless she reached over and combed my womb room. Yeah. Yeah, you look like you look like a man's wrecked softball

[25:48.020 --> 25:52.260]  All right, so we hyped up turpex a little bit what's uh, we mentioned a bunch of products

[25:57.780 --> 25:59.780]  Just mean give me a dab is that what that's
[26:00.660 --> 26:02.660]  I was like
[26:03.700 --> 26:05.700]  To say which one of these things he was
[26:08.660 --> 26:12.740]  That'll throw you off you gotta wipe your fingers off after you do that dude, I don't even want to touch you now
[26:14.020 --> 26:16.180]  Um, I would say I don't have a dab over here. I'm, sorry
[26:17.300 --> 26:22.740]  We have everybody in the room. We're good. I would say we're pretty excited about the uh, the edibles coming out
[26:22.820 --> 26:26.260]  You know, that's something that we've been working on for a while, but we just didn't want to you know
[26:26.740 --> 26:30.020]  Possibly some turp drink. Yeah, we didn't want to hit the market before
[26:31.220 --> 26:34.740]  You know, we really had everything figured out especially with how restrictive everything is out here
[26:35.460 --> 26:39.460]  The rules keep changing every week. Nobody's trying to shoot ropes like peter north on that
[26:40.500 --> 26:42.900]  Yeah, they hit edibles pretty hard with that milligram thing
[26:45.860 --> 26:49.860]  I think I win. I think I want to dab on that one. I definitely silenced the whole room. Where's that?
[26:50.820 --> 26:52.820]  Yeah
[26:53.140 --> 26:57.620]  So, yeah, I mean the edibles are gonna be on point once we can actually say there's gonna and I will say I'll go a
[26:57.620 --> 27:00.180]  Little bit more in depth on some things. There's gonna be like

[27:38.740 --> 27:44.340]  The tour of auracross should be high in cbd. The uglier plants will be higher in cbd is what I think
[27:44.500 --> 27:46.500]  Yeah, that's a great way to describe it. Yeah
[27:47.540 --> 27:51.220]  Bamboo hemp. Yeah. Yeah. Those those are the cbd plants not that you boy

[28:13.860 --> 28:19.860]  Um, you can't wear your headphones and take a dab. What is that about? I'd say like you can't you don't have to I was
[28:19.860 --> 28:22.980]  Just fucking with you because it was weird. It's like turning down the radio so you can see better
[28:23.220 --> 28:27.780]  We've got a we've got a few things that we're making this week. We're sending everything to get lab tested
[28:28.420 --> 28:29.540]  actually
[28:29.540 --> 28:34.340]  It's the shelf because you know, we don't want any you don't want to use 500 milligrams on accident
[28:34.980 --> 28:39.300]  Watch me do a merino dowd because I can handle that but you know, yeah, most people cannot
[28:39.860 --> 28:42.980]  Yeah, if you guys if you guys can take the 1200 milligram challenge in a day
[28:43.220 --> 28:46.340]  We'd love we'd love to hang out explain the 1200 milligram challenge to me
[28:46.900 --> 28:51.780]  Uh, so kind of like no melt nebraska. Can we get a little bit of guitar behind the background?
[28:52.260 --> 28:54.260]  Yeah, i'll try to go with it
[28:54.900 --> 28:56.820]  um, but yeah like uh
[28:56.820 --> 29:02.180]  I mean the 1200 milligram challenge is is much like no melt nebraska in a sense where the name kind of gives it away
[29:02.340 --> 29:05.220]  But there's a lot more in depth about your passion for the actual event
[29:05.700 --> 29:06.660]  so
[29:06.660 --> 29:11.940]  You know you want to start off probably with maybe 400 to 800 milligrams and slowly work your way up to 12
[29:12.020 --> 29:16.420]  And then at that point you go outside and put your hands up in the air and scream up to joe. Thank you
[29:16.500 --> 29:18.100]  And have a great day
[29:18.100 --> 29:20.180]  It's it's basically like like any other
[29:20.900 --> 29:24.740]  Mental or physical challenge. It's something that you need to work yourself up to you
[29:24.740 --> 29:29.380]  Know you can't just jump in at 1200 milligrams because I did a couple of days at 2500
[29:30.020 --> 29:35.060]  Can I get a sponsor? Can I get a sponsor for this? Oh, yeah. I mean like I need somebody to throw down
[29:35.540 --> 29:38.680]  Um, I need 1200 and then I need 800
[29:39.460 --> 29:41.940]  So now we're at 2000 and then I need 600
[29:42.580 --> 29:46.180]  You want to step yourself? Yeah, I want to do like, okay. I want to do it like a 300
[29:46.260 --> 29:49.860]  I think I can do i've done 350 i've eaten a 350 milligram. I will tell you that
[29:50.900 --> 29:57.220]  The way that I have I have found best to imbibe the 1200 milligrams is straight capsules and you open the capsules up
[29:57.380 --> 29:59.380]  And take them while they're half half open
[29:59.540 --> 30:03.060]  Okay, and then you just pretty much, you know, you just jump right in like a landscarpet
[30:03.460 --> 30:08.500]  See the the last time we were preparing for the the milligram the 1200 milligram challenge
[30:09.060 --> 30:11.300]  I was actually pretty disappointed because I was you know
[30:11.380 --> 30:16.020]  Talking hell of shit on everybody because I had been training really hard like I was waking up every day
[30:16.340 --> 30:20.260]  And just slamming a thought, you know putting up eating a thousand milligrams for breakfast
[30:20.660 --> 30:25.140]  You know what i'm saying then having another cup of honor for lunch, you know what i'm saying? I was ready by the time
[30:25.860 --> 30:27.940]  That happened. Everybody else had been eating so many
[30:28.500 --> 30:34.580]  Capsules too training for training for the challenge that it was just like shit wasn't going well business-wise for anybody
[30:34.980 --> 30:39.060]  Yeah, you definitely have a very relaxed state of mind the one homie the one homie in washington
[30:39.060 --> 30:40.340]  Who was going to be doing it with us?
[30:40.340 --> 30:43.540]  He broke like two mothership minis in a week or some shit like that
[30:43.700 --> 30:50.500]  I believe the exact story was that he knocked over his mothership mini bubbler while he was trying to go to sleep and also
[30:50.580 --> 30:54.820]  Had like a tornado of money blowing around on his patio or some shit
[30:55.460 --> 30:59.620]  I so yeah, I mean that's what i'm saying is it's not like you want to go straight to the black diamonds at the mountain
[30:59.700 --> 31:01.700]  And throw yourself down
[31:01.700 --> 31:05.620]  Serious 1200 is yeah, we wanted to make sure we were over a thousand
[31:05.860 --> 31:08.840]  Um, and if you really want to get intense you try to hit 2500
[31:10.820 --> 31:12.820]  That just sounds the room again, so
[31:13.060 --> 31:16.500]  That's like that's like the gram dab of edibles is what we're doing pretty much. Yeah
[31:16.580 --> 31:20.820]  And one also it's like if you if you don't smoke those are obviously good ways to do it if you're really trying to get
[31:20.820 --> 31:25.880]  You know some sort of sedation for me. It was just the fact that like I don't have anxiety and i'm extremely
[31:26.500 --> 31:30.660]  Focused and let's be real if you're trying to like never get sick, you know what i'm saying?
[31:31.060 --> 31:37.940]  As we know cannabis cancer can cure everything pretty much. So if you eat that shit, you're gonna be fucking
[31:38.420 --> 31:41.940]  That was the other thought right? Is it like we figured if we could do like 1200 milligrams for a month?
[31:42.020 --> 31:45.540]  There was no way that we would ever have any pathogens cancers bullshit
[31:45.700 --> 31:50.260]  Like there's no way they even get into us because we're just super saturated in our cannabinoid system in our lymph nodes
[31:50.260 --> 31:55.540]  Yeah, so I need a sponsor somebody throw down like okay 2500 pills or 2500
[31:58.260 --> 32:02.020]  We'll take care of you jeff between all parties in the room i'm sure we've got
[32:05.220 --> 32:07.220]  We are not liable for what happens after you hit
[32:08.100 --> 32:10.660]  I don't as long as none of them are real high cbd
[32:10.900 --> 32:14.420]  Have I told you guys about my cbd adventures? Have you listened to the episode with cbd?
[32:14.660 --> 32:17.620]  No, you guys are all extra extract artists. What do you guys call yourselves?
[32:17.940 --> 32:20.900]  Extract artists the term anymore. Is there a is there a word to use?
[32:22.100 --> 32:24.600]  Okay, everyone goes silent. Um, I remember extract
[32:27.860 --> 32:30.820]  We're not crazy about that term so you guys just hash guys, right?
[32:30.900 --> 32:32.580]  Yeah, just have your turpex. All right
[32:32.580 --> 32:36.900]  So these you guys are hash guys, you know, we started doing this shit because we love it
[32:37.140 --> 32:41.160]  And you guys are gonna love this. This is the appropriate group. I've noticed if I smoke too much cbd
[32:41.700 --> 32:43.220]  I can't bust a nut
[32:43.220 --> 32:44.900]  Really? Yeah
[32:44.900 --> 32:47.380]  You go full drunk. Yeah. Well, no, no, it works
[32:47.700 --> 32:52.660]  It's like it's still yeah, it just won't there's no way it's birth control. It's just a fucking man. Yeah
[32:53.460 --> 32:56.980]  I have not been smoking enough cb, you know, you're just not too fast
[32:58.100 --> 33:00.100]  No, he just gets it done. He's done
[33:01.220 --> 33:05.620]  You know, I haven't smoked enough cbds to really perform that kind of research on myself, I guess
[33:06.660 --> 33:10.260]  I went to a dispensary. I had a a chick friend who was actually this guy's gonna go, you know
[33:10.340 --> 33:12.340]  Smoke a bunch of cbds and beat his dick. Yeah
[33:13.060 --> 33:13.940]  That's kind of how it happened
[33:13.940 --> 33:18.900]  We went to the dispensary and bought a bunch of cbd medicine and we smoked out and we went to the house and tried to
[33:19.060 --> 33:21.540]  Fucking shag and there was no it was fun, dude
[33:21.540 --> 33:25.300]  We're both like yeah, but like an hour of just sweating on each other. I looked at her. I was like, I don't think
[33:26.900 --> 33:29.460]  Just two wooks walking around just working it out, dude. Yeah
[33:30.420 --> 33:33.060]  It's a nice little look out for the day. How do you think that's mouth?
[33:34.420 --> 33:37.780]  About as good as his story about shitting in his buddy's vw bus. Yeah
[33:39.380 --> 33:41.380]  That did happen
[33:43.220 --> 33:48.020]  There's another podcast for that one I I have never found that with cbds, but I mean, I don't know maybe I
[33:48.100 --> 33:52.180]  I think it's the same thing. I don't I don't tend to to lean towards the cbds as much as i'm looking for
[33:52.420 --> 33:54.020]  Thcv
[33:54.020 --> 33:56.020]  I'm gonna try it. Yeah, right
[33:57.860 --> 33:59.860]  Go jerk off
[34:00.100 --> 34:02.660]  Wait 24 hours smoke a bunch of cbd herb
[34:02.740 --> 34:05.940]  Go try to whack one out and see if it's just like three quarters of the way there
[34:06.020 --> 34:08.660]  I mean, I mean what ratio is this? I mean this might be something
[34:09.460 --> 34:12.680]  It was exactly it was actually the canna tonic it was like 21
[34:14.740 --> 34:19.460]  Or something yeah, it was one of those strains 21 to one. Yeah, something like that bringing bringing
[34:20.980 --> 34:23.140]  Gw pharma is patenting a 21
[34:24.820 --> 34:26.820]  Colorado spring
[34:27.620 --> 34:29.620]  Yeah, g pharma was like oh what
[34:31.700 --> 34:32.820]  Let's patent that
[34:32.820 --> 34:36.980]  That no it'll ever come again. I wonder what happens if you hit like an 80 to one ratio
[34:37.060 --> 34:42.740]  I wonder if you just like turn into like titanium superman. What I was talking to a nurse and she said I think she's a
[34:42.740 --> 34:47.860]  Paramedic or something and she said that there is an electrical response in your brain that causes a seizure
[34:48.340 --> 34:51.940]  And that same electrical response in your brain is responsible for your orgasm
[34:52.020 --> 34:56.900]  It's like an electrical firing and when you smoke cbd, it turns that off. That's why you don't have a seizure
[34:56.980 --> 35:02.660]  Well, they coat that that receptor. Yeah, and you're right. You're coating your your freaking cum receptor, too. It's the same thing
[35:03.540 --> 35:07.940]  Dude you're literally muting your cum receptor. You're just putting like a cover over it so that it just can't
[35:08.260 --> 35:10.340]  It's like getting an elevator with no 13th floor
[35:11.700 --> 35:15.160]  The government's gonna get a hold of that and use it for fucking overpopulation
[35:15.860 --> 35:17.540]  Something and yeah
[35:17.540 --> 35:19.940]  Yep, but that's just something I discovered thought we'd share
[35:20.660 --> 35:24.180]  Well, we'll tell you if you do the I know they grow a lot of hemp in china and they use that shit
[35:24.180 --> 35:26.180]  And it ain't working over there
[35:26.500 --> 35:28.660]  It is not working give john john a microphone
[35:29.540 --> 35:32.260]  So you're saying cbds will actually make you last longer yes
[35:32.820 --> 35:37.700]  Much longer I couldn't I couldn't come at all. I'll tell you the truth. I need to smoke more cbd
[35:38.260 --> 35:43.300]  Some people need to be getting on them cbd's then yeah, if you're a minute man, then get up on the cbd on the fucking cb
[35:43.360 --> 35:50.260]  Dizzles. Yep smoke that shit. Let's be honest. We've all been under the minute before. Oh, there's been times. Yeah. Yeah, you know
[35:51.380 --> 35:53.380]  Sometimes i'm proud
[35:55.140 --> 35:57.140]  First one's always easy
[35:58.100 --> 36:02.820]  It's about getting back up after you fall right every time that's a warm-up just take a viagra, you know, you'll be good
[36:03.220 --> 36:06.820]  I mean, I will tell you if you do the 1200 milligram challenge, you'll probably have the same effect. Yeah
[36:07.700 --> 36:11.140]  I've noticed that I don't know if i'll be able to pay attention long enough to even care. Yeah
[36:11.860 --> 36:13.860]  Tug tug tug. I want to play xbox
[36:15.700 --> 36:17.700]  You know, you're getting old and you get bored jerking off
[36:19.540 --> 36:21.540]  This is stupid
[36:22.580 --> 36:24.580]  Again and again and again
[36:25.140 --> 36:27.140]  The first one was easy
[36:27.140 --> 36:30.260]  All right. Uh shit. We've gotten way off course here
[36:31.060 --> 36:35.780]  Always happens 420s coming up and i've been told that there is a cannabis cup booth
[36:36.580 --> 36:40.500]  Well there there is some things in the work. Obviously we talked earlier about all the different brands
[36:40.580 --> 36:46.980]  But lots of brands smoky brand one of the um big badass clothing companies that I help work with. Um,
[36:47.380 --> 36:49.380]  They've decided to kind of do this. Uh
[36:49.620 --> 36:53.540]  Road show every year so i'll be you know manning up and running their production for
[36:54.180 --> 36:58.660]  The denver cannabis cup coming up seattle sam fran la and then we'll be doing. Um

[37:10.420 --> 37:12.420]  But um this cannabis cup in denver
[37:12.660 --> 37:14.100]  We will have a smoky brand booth
[37:14.100 --> 37:18.820]  That'll be a really large island and there's probably like four or five brands that i'm not able to say yet

[37:55.860 --> 38:00.180]  I don't believe you're going to be able to have anything going on. I think high times just cancelled the medical side of it, too
[38:00.180 --> 38:02.180]  Right. Yeah, i'm not sure it was so wow
[38:02.900 --> 38:06.340]  That yeah, definitely it's hearsay, but yeah, there's definitely a bunch of different rumors going around

[40:04.260 --> 40:08.340]  To get some beans iris genetics is probably a company that you should have in your garden. I appreciate that

[40:29.060 --> 40:33.060]  I will say that, you know, one of the biggest ones that we all talk about is the lemon jeffrey because that's the you know
[40:33.140 --> 40:35.140]  the one hitter
[40:37.060 --> 40:42.180]  Their arguments i've crossed the lemon jeffrey to the grateful dog and their arguments over what the name is going to be
[40:45.780 --> 40:47.780]  Yeah the room
[40:48.820 --> 40:53.940]  Give john john a mic for a second. Oh king joffrey king game of thrones. Yeah
[40:55.540 --> 41:00.260]  Okay, that's what my buddy said that all right somebody else told me that I didn't get the reference there the joffrey chaucer
[41:00.420 --> 41:06.900]  He was a real dickhead king. Yeah. Well that that's me. I'm a dickhead. I don't know hashtag spoilers. They ended up poisoning him
[41:09.860 --> 41:14.340]  I slung them out there spoilers. Yeah, that's cool. I like it controversy on the show
[41:18.580 --> 41:22.660]  There's tons of I mean, I don't know the lemon is so prevalent it depends like you were saying
[41:23.380 --> 41:27.300]  We gotta taste it, you know, that's what i'm thinking well, it's hanging up I would love a taste it's hanging up
[41:27.380 --> 41:30.980]  Well, i'll let you taste it really hanging up right now. It's hanging up. It's upside down. It's de-leafed
[41:31.380 --> 41:35.540]  It's gonna get that final trim a couple days in a jar right now. It's looking like that 70s bush
[41:36.340 --> 41:37.700]  God, dude
[41:37.700 --> 41:41.540]  God, yes, here's the question. Is it gonna make some full meld or some nebraska?
[41:41.940 --> 41:46.980]  You know, uh, I don't fuck around and it's gonna make some uh, turpex shatter or some live resin
[41:46.980 --> 41:49.620]  That's what I was some garden of weed and live. That's what I was looking for
[41:50.340 --> 41:53.700]  Yeah, that's all I flux with if it's not if I I can make my own hash
[41:53.700 --> 41:57.540]  I don't have my own vac of and luckily i've got friends that let me use their vac I can make some decent hash
[41:57.940 --> 41:59.940]  But uh garden of weed and shout out boys
[42:01.060 --> 42:02.900]  They live five minutes away from me. That's my homies
[42:02.900 --> 42:08.100]  They make most of my hash for me and since nobody's had a harvest for a minute and we're hash heads and we smoked all
[42:08.180 --> 42:12.900]  Our hash it's been turpex is my second reliable source. Yeah, shout out to garden of weed and iry

[44:20.800 --> 44:24.160]  That's surely that good. We do have some good we're waiting for um
[44:24.240 --> 44:27.840]  We're waiting for our massively grown crop to come in and that'll be you know
[44:27.920 --> 44:32.080]  And then probably like two months but right now we have great flowers and everything on the shelf
[44:32.160 --> 44:36.720]  We have an unbelievable concentrate selection. Sometimes we're up to like 24 different flavors of concentrates
[44:37.280 --> 44:40.960]  Right now I think we're at like 13 that durban poison. I shouldn't even say it dude that
[44:41.600 --> 44:43.600]  Is
[44:52.640 --> 44:56.320]  The one that I want to know about this name, uh drake's handkerchief
[44:56.960 --> 45:00.320]  You should probably put the nature boy rick flair on the mic because that's his name that he came up with
[45:00.400 --> 45:05.040]  Let's hear about this nature boy knows what's up with the turn get up on the top rope and tell me about this shit
[45:05.760 --> 45:09.100]  Um
[45:17.180 --> 45:19.680]  It's actually based on the video game uncharted
[45:20.460 --> 45:27.260]  You see because he's drake is an adventurer and he has a handkerchief and the real story. This is what happened
[45:27.340 --> 45:31.820]  This is what got it out of him though that got it out of him. This is what happened. It was some fucking
[45:32.380 --> 45:34.380]  it was some flow and
[45:35.260 --> 45:37.820]  Ha ha ha there's some flow and some blue dream
[45:39.580 --> 45:43.580]  Cross and so we thought you know people are gonna cry when they fucking hit this
[45:47.100 --> 45:50.780]  And so we just said fuck I mean who's who's like cries a lot and we're like drake
[45:51.100 --> 45:56.240]  Fucking was playing maybe on pandora or something and just I don't know it was not playing on pandora
[45:56.460 --> 46:01.820]  Maybe just I will say that's the only concentrate we will ever see that has the word handkerchief in it. Yeah
[46:02.380 --> 46:04.380]  And the name drake I hope
[46:05.420 --> 46:09.900]  You pretty much said what I said when I saw the drop but I was like wow really now we got to explain what genetics
[46:09.980 --> 46:11.980]  Drake handkerchief is to everybody
[46:12.700 --> 46:15.660]  I like this story and you're right because uh, hashtag fuck blue dream
[46:16.300 --> 46:18.300]  Fuck blue dream and flow
[46:18.940 --> 46:20.940]  and flow and
[46:21.500 --> 46:25.180]  I know you guys out there with that fucking dj shortcut and all kinds of other bullshit
[46:25.340 --> 46:29.100]  whatever else and talk about that blue dream shit, let's talk about that for a second because
[46:29.900 --> 46:32.860]  Since moving to fucking colorado i've seen more flow
[46:33.260 --> 46:38.620]  Or shit that smells or tastes exactly like fucking flow than i've seen ever in my fucking life
[46:38.940 --> 46:43.660]  What is up with that? Is that the bomb shit out here? They don't they don't like kush. They don't like yeah
[46:43.660 --> 46:45.660]  Where's the kush it grows?
[46:45.900 --> 46:47.980]  Uh, the dog's trying to go outside. Okay, it's cool
[46:48.060 --> 46:51.500]  I think I mean I think a lot of it is the fact that like that blue dream just blows up like a balloon
[46:51.500 --> 46:53.500]  For people that don't know what they're doing
[46:53.900 --> 46:58.460]  Yeah, you could go to blue dream. Uh, the flow is super easy to grow here. It grows outdoors
[46:59.340 --> 47:03.420]  Dude's trying to get laid with your chick buy them the blue dream blue dream the girls love. Oh my god
[47:03.420 --> 47:08.300]  I fucking love blue dream. Yeah, and if you're if you're a mediocre grower and you need to pull some weight
[47:08.540 --> 47:11.820]  Uh dream blue dream is for you. Fuck. Yeah. Yeah, if you've never grown wheat
[47:12.700 --> 47:15.180]  If you've never grown weed before and you're about kelly
[47:18.060 --> 47:22.300]  I think the flow the flow that goes around here actually came from dj short
[47:22.540 --> 47:26.620]  Gave that cut to ed rosenthal who passed it around to a few people out here and my friend tom
[47:27.020 --> 47:30.540]  Uh had a dispensary here and a dispensary in pueblo and he spread that out
[47:30.860 --> 47:33.660]  Through his dispensaries a lot and it also went through other sources
[47:33.660 --> 47:35.340]  I'm, not saying he put it all over for sure
[47:35.340 --> 47:38.700]  But that cut I actually think is dj's flotica and not flow
[47:38.780 --> 47:43.340]  I think back in the 1940s when they eradicated this back in the day. They should have done that to blue dream
[47:44.060 --> 47:46.380]  Definitely blue dream should never exist
[47:46.540 --> 47:51.420]  So I crossed the blue dream to the grateful dog and I call it the blue healer and uh, it fixed blue dream
[47:51.580 --> 47:52.140]  Did it? Yeah
[47:52.140 --> 47:58.140]  Well, it made the uh made much larger grateful dog nuggets and it comes out a lot like grateful dog just better harvests. Okay
[47:59.420 --> 48:01.180]  You can polish a turd. Yes
[48:01.180 --> 48:04.860]  But now the part that sucks is I have to keep a mother plant of blue dream in the car all the time
[48:05.340 --> 48:09.660]  So actually we should get off of blue dream and get on to some other strains that are probably better
[48:09.740 --> 48:13.980]  I mean, I know that we all dislike certain stuff. What do you got that's coming down the pipeline?
[48:15.180 --> 48:17.900]  I've been working on this f2 of black cherry kim. Um
[48:17.980 --> 48:19.420]  Um
[48:19.420 --> 48:21.900]  I think you see that i'm gonna say a name that i've never said on the show
[48:21.900 --> 48:24.700]  But I think if I say it then nobody can steal it from me because it'll be out there
[48:24.860 --> 48:29.660]  I'm gonna hit a dead head og plant with black cherry kim pollen and I want to call it cherry garcia
[48:30.220 --> 48:32.220]  Because I think that's cool as fuck
[48:34.780 --> 48:39.820]  I'll spell it different. Yeah, it'll be cool. I would I would definitely be down to taste those turds. Yeah
[48:39.900 --> 48:43.740]  Yeah, we'll run those. Oh, i'm trying to find a name for that lemon jeffrey grateful dog
[48:44.060 --> 48:48.460]  I'm working on I want to work for i'm looking for an arise male plant right now
[48:48.700 --> 48:53.420]  I want to start using the arise as my breeding staple. That'll be my next boy that goes for a long time
[48:53.580 --> 48:57.420]  Okay, it'll be like my new stud for the next couple of years. What are the terps like on that guy?
[48:57.660 --> 49:03.260]  It's a golden goat crossed a daybreaker. So it's sweet kush. I like that daybreaker. The daybreaker is a great plant
[49:03.340 --> 49:08.380]  Yeah, and the anything you put to the golden goat makes resin like it just resin comes out of that bitch
[49:08.460 --> 49:11.740]  So yeah that male will make everything resiny and stanky
[49:12.060 --> 49:13.980]  Okay, so
[49:13.980 --> 49:17.580]  I want to talk about something real quick. That's the new thing going on all along the social
[49:17.580 --> 49:22.700]  We got to talk about this rosin text rosin. Oh, what are your thoughts? Um, I haven't tried it yet. Hashtag space
[49:23.420 --> 49:25.180]  I have not tried it. Actually
[49:25.180 --> 49:27.740]  I have an interview we're ahead of ourselves in recording
[49:27.820 --> 49:33.420]  But i've recorded an episode that i've left a blank spot to throw in an interview with soil grown so that I can learn a bit
[49:33.420 --> 49:36.460]  About it. So hopefully in the last episode that got tossed in there
[49:36.700 --> 49:40.780]  But the interview is supposed to happen tomorrow when I get home. So this is yeah, this is awkward
[49:41.340 --> 49:43.340]  Traveling in time
[49:43.500 --> 49:46.940]  Fucks with my head trying to do that too. Well, that's what cbd can do also
[49:47.500 --> 49:48.860]  Yes, yes
[49:48.860 --> 49:53.580]  So hold on with the rosin tech that shit's been around since like the fucking 60s in the 70s
[49:53.660 --> 49:56.240]  Just like a lot of the other stuff. Yeah, it's not necessarily
[49:56.860 --> 50:00.620]  Gonna, you know, they say that good. Sorry. I'm out of the loop. You want to know what it is?
[50:00.700 --> 50:03.660]  What is it you take your weed and you put it in a piece of parchment paper and fold it up?
[50:03.820 --> 50:07.740]  You take weed you take a fucking nugget and then you hit you either hair
[50:07.740 --> 50:11.420]  Press it people are using a t-shirt press like they and then the 60s and 70s
[50:11.420 --> 50:12.540]  That's what would happen back in the days
[50:12.540 --> 50:16.380]  They would take that shitty weed and t-shirt press it and be able to extract something
[50:16.380 --> 50:22.300]  They wouldn't call bubble hash that would sell for more and I know that from my time being a cultivator in tijuana
[50:22.940 --> 50:24.300]  nice
[50:24.300 --> 50:30.940]  Yeah, but that's a story for a different day. Yeah, we'll get on that note after the as completely solventless like there's no
[50:32.060 --> 50:34.060]  Not even water. So yeah
[50:34.060 --> 50:39.580]  It's activating and expressing it as it's heating it so you are still losing some potency if it gets hot
[50:42.620 --> 50:44.620]  Right, yeah, are you activating it though?
[50:45.020 --> 50:47.260]  Uh, it is becoming decarbed and yeah
[50:47.340 --> 50:52.940]  Yeah, you're heating it because they're using like 100 degrees or something and I think 106 is where decarbing starts right around
[50:53.100 --> 50:55.180]  I mean, I I have nothing against it, but
[50:55.900 --> 50:58.940]  It doesn't really do much. I mean it does it melts and it gets high and all that stuff
[50:58.940 --> 51:03.100]  But it's not the same terpene profile as an arowana r&d specialist. I think we should try it
[51:03.260 --> 51:07.500]  Okay, you should definitely i'd love to see some locals do it so that I could take a dab of it and talk about it
[51:07.500 --> 51:09.500]  On the show. Yeah, yeah
[51:09.740 --> 51:11.740]  Well, then there you have it. Obviously now
[51:12.540 --> 51:15.820]  Somebody go to the beauty supply store and pick up a hair straightener
[51:16.540 --> 51:20.300]  I was at walgreens today and I saw like a whole fucking aisle of them. Yeah
[51:20.460 --> 51:24.140]  They're gonna be gone in the next couple days. You took a couple seconds and looked at them all
[51:24.780 --> 51:30.460]  I really did. I remember when bed bath and beyond put the dab torches the little nose stick mats and uh
[51:30.620 --> 51:36.540]  Turkey basters all in the same area and uh pyrex dishes. It was all on one little they're like dab guys. Here you go
[51:37.340 --> 51:39.340]  It's like a computer program
[51:40.060 --> 51:43.020]  You know, they know what people buy at the same time and they put it together
[51:43.100 --> 51:45.820]  Yep, they're gonna buy a controller a game and a headset
[51:47.340 --> 51:53.020]  They say it seems like people are buying a lot of torches and turkey basters at the same time
[51:53.100 --> 51:59.260]  We should put them together and juice. I think that's important. I'm allowed to say that because i'm a jew
[52:01.340 --> 52:06.540]  Yes, you are jordan you'll be okay i'm interested to see what happens next as opposed to like going back into like the ride
[52:06.620 --> 52:11.580]  Yes, and all the other shit and the co2 and all the ice water and I just I got a call from a friend today
[52:11.580 --> 52:12.620]  he's
[52:12.620 --> 52:17.180]  Is working on some sort of large scale version of a hair
[52:17.900 --> 52:22.460]  Straight t-shirt press situation because he's like dude this shit's dude
[52:23.820 --> 52:25.820]  Wow
[52:26.380 --> 52:27.260]  Sure
[52:27.260 --> 52:28.860]  This is it man
[52:28.860 --> 52:33.020]  It's been the big thing lately on the social media. It's all people want to talk about his page is blown up
[52:33.100 --> 52:38.540]  He's got mad followers right mad mad followers in this episode. I just randomly thought about this. I put it took a note in my head

[53:02.460 --> 53:03.740]  This has been way too much fun
[53:03.740 --> 53:08.780]  We took some uh, we took some show notes and hunt wrote down the phrase getting globby and put little marks by it
[53:08.860 --> 53:10.860]  What are no slabby? I can't hear you
[53:13.420 --> 53:18.380]  We're getting sloppy we are getting slabby let's congregate and get
[53:19.260 --> 53:23.980]  Sloppy i'm gonna pass you the rig so you can get
[53:26.780 --> 53:31.900]  Obviously it worked I guess did it work? Yeah. I got you. I got you. That was good. It's just
[53:35.660 --> 53:39.660]  I can actually kind of tell that's trained. I'm like monkeys the first time I met
[53:40.220 --> 53:44.300]  Mr. Hunt was at a cannabis cup in denver and he came up to me
[53:45.180 --> 53:52.220]  And my partner shane and he's like what do you guys do i'm like nothing he's like I think we should congregate and get sloppy
[53:54.780 --> 54:00.140]  And it's stuck now people all over the world are going to say let's congregate and get slabby
[54:06.220 --> 54:13.420]  Actually kind of turned into a joke at the processing facility too whenever you know because we run stuff for 70 different centers or so
[54:13.740 --> 54:17.100]  And some you know, sometimes we get some shit that just yields terribly
[54:17.500 --> 54:23.980]  So the guy we're getting sloppy the guy whatever whenever we've run like a thousand gram column and there's just basically, you know
[54:23.980 --> 54:25.980]  There's virtually nothing in there
[54:25.980 --> 54:27.340]  fucking homeboy
[54:27.340 --> 54:30.400]  You yell out from the back. We are getting slabby
[54:31.260 --> 54:33.420]  And you know, you know and then you know, it's yeah
[54:33.420 --> 54:37.100]  It's kind of like, you know when all the hooters chicks come up and sing happy birthday to you and all the same stuff
[54:37.180 --> 54:39.260]  You know, you gotta have the same shit going now a long time ago
[54:39.260 --> 54:42.000]  I went to guitar center and I bought a piece of equipment called a compressor
[54:42.400 --> 54:47.840]  Yeah, and uh, i've never been happier that I bought that because you did not blow out the rest of my equipment just now
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.000]  I did not know that that was even something I had to be worried
[54:52.640 --> 54:58.320]  That's my job to think about it fucking nice this compressor just paid for its damn self. That was awesome. Thank you compressor
[54:58.320 --> 54:59.760]  Thank you. I got one. You know what i'm saying?

[59:43.200 --> 59:47.680]  This has been one of my favorite episodes to record and I hate to say that to all my homies back at home
[59:47.680 --> 59:52.480]  That record with me, but you guys brought something to the table that hasn't been brought to the table for a while
[59:53.040 --> 01:00:00.160]  There's definitely a weird thing in this house. Um, i'm actually sitting next to my business partner and my father as well as my friend
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.520]  Yeah
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.520]  Shit just got weird
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.840]  I'm looking around the room. There's nobody here old enough to be your father
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:13.600]  So unless there's an urn in the room, that doesn't make any sense. I'm talking about jordan. He's my he's my father. Oh, that's your father
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:17.360]  Yeah, i've been nicknamed dad, you know by
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:21.120]  Pretty much everybody in the story like the are you the turpex king? Basically?
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.920]  No, I wouldn't say the king but I would say
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:28.020]  The you know fatherly figure, you know the godfather
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:29.760]  No
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.320]  That's little anthony jr. Jr from brooklyn that comes in every now
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:37.280]  You know more like you know, the the guy who you call when you you know, your your battery's dead
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:41.600]  You need your car jumped and you need your car jumped in fountain. That's not me. You know what I mean?
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:47.360]  I'm, i'm the good son. I'm the good son. I would imagine no, but you're the good son
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:51.200]  But i've also judge on the mic. I've also had to have I can't hear him at all without the mic
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.500]  I've also had to you know sit there and have discussions
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.040]  um
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.520]  About birth control. Yeah, you know that got shouted out from the other fucking room, by the way
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:04.080]  He's like the brian epstein of turpex
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.480]  Hashtag beetles reference. Yes. Yes. I'm not sure. Yeah, that's all right
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.720]  He was the manager of the beetles and then once he died they all fell apart and blamed it on yoko. Yeah
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:15.280]  Uh, does the dude want to be on the show at all?
[01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:20.960]  Any desire to I doubt it doubt it he's getting down on some turps over there, but I would say I mean hopefully I mean
[01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:24.720]  I was trying to put together a star-studded cast for this so we could get a repeat performance
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:26.800]  Oh, you guys will be back, bro
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.160]  We made it shout out to hunt for helping me carry my gear because this shoe is too heavy
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:32.240]  I couldn't get it out of the car by myself
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:36.240]  Anytime you need production or you need me to line up some talent, bro. You just give me a call
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.320]  That's what we do. What kind of talent you got bro? Who do you need?
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.600]  Whatever you can name and i'll try to make it get them all here
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.840]  They don't call them the gatherer for nothing we need to get uh, we need to get addy back on the show
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:50.560]  He was on episode number two and I sucked at podcasting. He'll be in town for the cannabis cup
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.080]  Uh shout out to the guy that doesn't want to come in the room. He's still getting some
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.680]  Great. He told he told me one time. He's like, no, I don't want to do that
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:00.080]  Like I could tell he was like, nope. I want to be in the back girl
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.600]  He's about 17 dabs in relaxing after being under lights all day. Yeah, so shout out he deserves the time bro
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:10.880]  We're gonna get serious for half a second. We were talking today at the shop about being under high intensity discharge lights
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:16.400]  Oh, yeah for sure. Definitely. Um hunt taught me something I never thought about guys cover your skin up in the grow rooms
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:19.040]  If you're if you're in your own personal grow, you're probably all right
[01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:24.400]  But if you're in like a room with like 20 or 30 or 40 or like I work with there's 120 lights in some of the places
[01:02:25.040 --> 01:02:27.840]  Uh cover your skin up cover the top of your head wear some glasses
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:33.680]  Definitely people are getting melanoma people are seeing weird shit on their heads are getting like signs of sunburn their hair is falling out
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:36.480]  And shit, uh, you're gonna go blind in there get some good glasses
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.760]  I didn't even think of that. I only think about the glasses
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.520]  Cover up your skin cover your hands. No for sure. Yeah, it's definitely um, you gotta think about exposure sunscreen
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.800]  I don't know if it's
[01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:54.640]  Maybe that's a really good question. I'm not I don't I'm not a dermatologist or a sunscreen producer. So I don't or a scientist
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.840]  Yeah, I just guys aren't scientists. I just play one on the internet
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.440]  Yeah, it's um, it's definitely something that's been talked about here there, you know
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.440]  Obviously it's the exposure rate that you're in, you know
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.560]  Grow room for six to eight hours a day. Um, it's definitely great. You know, it's great to cover I have tattoos. So that's why I choose
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.760]  That's why I choose to use them
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:18.880]  I use long sleeves and hats and glasses and all that stuff because then my ink doesn't fade and I don't have to worry about
[01:03:18.880 --> 01:03:24.640]  All the other stuff but I have heard some from some of my homies that are in um, so the cali early in aspel they get down
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.720]  You know solid
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.680]  If you're tatted up
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.720]  Such sick tats, bro. Damn. He is
[01:03:34.480 --> 01:03:36.480]  He's tatted up shirt up i'm
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.680]  His pubes are shirt. There's a lot of man meat for he's got where his pubes should be. There's a tattoo or a thursday night
[01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:43.120]  It's a tattoo of pubes
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:44.320]  But you can see the difference though
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:49.520]  I can see the difference in your arm tattoos and your body tattoos like from having your shirt and where you're exposed like the dude's
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.800]  Tatted guys and you can
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:51.920]  I'm at the color
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.440]  I know what you have to go through at the med to be an owner of a dispensary and I can only imagine they documented
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.000]  There was a whole a whole page of your tattoos
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:07.360]  Because i've seen other stories of like they did each leg. I was actually like do you think you should formal formalize this or you know?
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:10.560]  He's like no just writing it on a piece of paper, man. It's good enough
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.600]  I was like i'm not really trying to I mean they asked they asked for all of your your tattoos and what they are
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.600]  And all that kind of stuff. But yeah, I mean I literally had to
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.040]  Sit down and figure it all out
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.120]  So I just went by body part and I just told them all the body parts that were tattooed which is pretty much everyone
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.280]  Other than you know a couple
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:28.480]  Ass cheeks, I got a hundred dollar bill in my dick because I like to play with my money
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:36.160]  Guys if you want to find out if that's true come to the cannabis grand crew in aspen this november hashtag wiener tattoo
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:42.580]  No, no. Oh, actually I can say that the the next cannabis grand crew is may 30th in seattle, washington

[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.880]  Unless uh, the grammy gatsby is paying for that shit, you know

[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:19.920]  Hashtag fam is fam fam is fam grammy gets all day long
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.040]  All right
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.000]  So I hear a guitar just went brink and we're promised a song after a dab what happened is the bread song gonna come out?
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.440]  Today, is this the first global release of the bread song? We've been going for an hour
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.160]  You guys have one on mission for like an hour
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:38.640]  Nah, there's some people heard it. There's some 12 year olds on call of duty that got got the burn of that one
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:44.160]  Really but I mean we haven't practiced it in a while. We can we can try to lay something down
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.640]  But I probably got muted like five seconds into it. So yeah, probably maybe that's why I quit using
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.400]  I don't even play anymore because it's just everyone trolling everyone. Yeah, I play
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:57.680]  I was just singing. Yeah. Oh, actually, you know what else before you get into the song though?
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:02.720]  I mean you guys you guys did like a nice little pretty facelift over turtles with the logo on the website coming in
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:07.120]  Yes, we did. We did. Um, that actually just got to me today
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:09.600]  And uh changed it on instagram
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:12.880]  So check that out. And yeah, I think it's definitely a lot better
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:16.560]  I guess the website's gonna have all the places where we sell turpex, right?
[01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:20.000]  Yeah, I was gonna ask if there was a bunch of places you guys knew of where folks can get it
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.040]  But it's only medical so I didn't want to tease all the out-of-staters. Yeah
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.200]  I'll still tease all out of this homeboy sitting here might as well just say green and healthy wellness
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.800]  Yeah, go there. Go there. I was there for they're in the room. I hung out for what 30 literally
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:39.120]  I hung out for somewhere between an hour 30 and 40 minutes maybe an hour today and uh half the customers that showed up were
[01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:42.720]  Recreational people hoping to shop and he had to turn them away and that sucks
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  We hope
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.440]  You know if you are in colorado springs, you know, we would really appreciate it if you have the chance, you know
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.400]  Tell the people that you can about the shop. Also if you feel like it, um, and you're in support of the cannabis movement
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:59.200]  You know obviously tell your local representative what's going on because we don't have any rec cannabis other than you know
[01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.320]  Denver and some other places like that. Yeah, or just get your card for now
[01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:08.160]  Which sucks but that's or just if you need rec go drive down to pueblo and see mr. Jeff go down to the spot
[01:07:08.240 --> 01:07:10.320]  Come on down. I want to try something. Come on down
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.600]  We're trying to use sports fans getting slabby
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.200]  Yeah, I thought i'd get a chorus of monkeys but I was just taking a
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:30.160]  I just want to apologize. That's why you opened up the paper was to drop the getting slugged
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.320]  I didn't want to say getting globby again on accident
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:38.720]  Because I will tell you if you're in the right situation in an event and you yell out getting slabby you will find out where
[01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.720]  The terpic crew is
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:46.400]  Happens to me often that's just gonna happen. You'll be at the cup and some random kid from fucking no, mount nebraska's gonna go

[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.880]  Knockoff mothership. What's with the mothership hype anyway?
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:07.920]  I don't know, but I just sold mine for three, you know, almost three times that I paid for it back in 2012
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.200]  So I was pretty happy about that
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:13.360]  The hype is the fact that they're hard to get and a lot of the people that are seen as you know
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:19.040]  The top og triple og og to be heady, bro. You gotta have a mothership dude. All right
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:25.280]  This rig hits pretty well and it was not it didn't cost my car

[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:49.680]  Because I bought that this one of them 11 breads from the blower instead of uh instead of getting it from some random distributor
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.820]  Shout out mad rob again. Shout out 719
[01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.240]  719

[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760]  I

[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.960]  I was certified like four years ago
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:41.120]  That's probably hadn't changed that much. No, just stomp on that middle part of his chest until he breathes again
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:50.240]  Isn't cpr be like I need that bad moon rising and that's in that cpr no different band. Oh, that's ccr. Yeah
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.440]  That was that was good. That was a nice try. I can't believe you actually grabbed the microphone for that
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.240]  Because I had it I was ready
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:02.880]  Yeah, we do. I do need to say this though. I love I love kicking it with jeff because he goes to comedy shows
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:07.440]  He has awesome sense of humor, but the homeboy's timing is impeccable with most of his shit when he's dropping it
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.600]  Well, thank you. Thank you. You're welcome the take out your retainer bit. I wish we were recording for that
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:17.360]  Yeah, he was about to take a little hit of it. It was albuterol because he was choking his wheezing
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.600]  I asked him if he had to pull out his inhaler to hit it
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:22.880]  Everybody's trying to pull out his retainer. Sorry. I'm high. Yeah
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.360]  That was a psych out like basketball right there a little bit it's good when i'm on it, but when i'm not boy
[01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.640]  It's sloppy you're off right? I gave you a compliment about timing and then
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.600]  Globby at all. Yeah
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.640]  That rescues it all right there don't forget when you're out there by yourself and you don't know what to do. It's it's

[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.760]  Let's try it out and then put them in apothecary
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:57.440]  And that's how you know the nail is just right
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:01.680]  And then you put the dab on there and you get a little pube taste and a little turpex. Yeah
[01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:05.460]  It's delish. Yeah, it's like no melt mixed with turpex

[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.400]  I'm telling you it's a symptom time to cue the guitar

[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:15.890]  Gotta go from your heart. I don't know about you guys, but i've been walking around singing nobel nebraska for like a week now
[01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:18.610]  Yep
[01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:25.170]  It's uh, yeah the only downfall is they used a lot of
[01:21:27.650 --> 01:21:31.650]  Inside jokes, you know like and they tried to explain them to the best of the ability
[01:21:31.650 --> 01:21:34.050]  But it's it's more one of those things you had to bend there
[01:21:35.410 --> 01:21:38.610]  I was just laughing every time they would say something like ham wallet
[01:21:39.170 --> 01:21:44.210]  Or some the ham wallet in the beginning was I don't it got pushed off like it wasn't anything
[01:21:44.290 --> 01:21:45.090]  That was the idea
[01:21:45.090 --> 01:21:49.410]  I was letting shit just slide by because the more I was like, oh shit the more it came out
[01:21:49.490 --> 01:21:50.850]  It was fun to do but it was fun
[01:21:50.850 --> 01:21:57.250]  Just letting some shit slide too and you you would hear one of them like every everyone throughout the podcast like you
[01:21:57.410 --> 01:21:59.410]  Edit this right like just a little bit
[01:21:59.810 --> 01:22:02.690]  And you were like no, no, I just i'm too lazy for that
[01:22:02.770 --> 01:22:06.850]  I recorded three hours with those guys and I just cut out an hour and 20 right out of the middle
[01:22:06.850 --> 01:22:10.930]  They started playing nobel nebraska and I was like i'm gonna record from here. You guys are getting recorded
[01:22:11.250 --> 01:22:15.250]  They didn't know i'd been recording for like a full hour kind of like you guys don't realize i've been recording for at least
[01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.450]  A minute. Hey, you guys ready to do a podcast? I am ready. Let's do this

[01:23:14.060 --> 01:23:18.700]  I'm dtfo i'm dabbed the fuck out today been dabbing on some turpex shatter
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:22.460]  I also got some black cherry chem shatter from the garden of weeden. It's been a good day
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:27.260]  When when what day is it that you're not dabbed the fuck out though? I mean, um
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:31.020]  Early in the day early early in the early in the merlin
[01:23:31.100 --> 01:23:35.740]  Yeah, I don't know people are I surprisingly don't dab early in the morning. I'm not an early morning dabber
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:38.060]  I try to wait until I at least get a few things done
[01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:42.780]  Yeah, I mean i've i've come over here a couple times and it's like 7 10, you know first one of the day
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:45.340]  Yeah, you gotta do work before you dab out. I get uh
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.500]  If I dab too early I get lazy
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.300]  I just want to go right back to bed and then if I dab during work
[01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:52.700]  When i'm trying to get a lot of shit done, I just get out of focus
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.260]  I'll do the same thing to myself a flower
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:55.820]  Yeah, right
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:02.220]  Just try to wait and reward yourself a little if I grateful dog right after breakfast like it's gonna be a real productive day
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:04.860]  Yeah, yeah my buddy mitch shanassa shout out mitch
[01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:09.340]  He said that when you're dabbing every hour becomes 45 minutes of productive time
[01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:15.500]  So then I kind of believe him i'm gonna agree. I would argue with that between sativa and inica
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:18.700]  You know i'm saying like you're a real big sativa guy and usually
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:24.300]  If I come over here and get real ripped off sativa dabs, I don't go home and like uh, no i'm like what can we clean?
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:29.180]  Where where do we need to I kind of get that way but I end up doing some useless shit
[01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:33.740]  Like something that didn't even need to be done. My desk is organized. Yeah, completely organized
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:36.460]  All the dishes are perfectly clean in the kitchen, but it was useless
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:39.660]  I should have been doing way different stuff at the time at the time
[01:24:39.660 --> 01:24:41.340]  Yeah without a good sativa though
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:44.620]  The spring clean that just happened at my house would not have happened true
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.980]  That sure a lot of stuff got extra attention that it definitely didn't deserve
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:53.100]  Like all of my books didn't need to be pulled out and dusted and put back on a shelf, but it happened
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:57.260]  Yeah, see that that's the shit that some dabs will do to you. Yeah, that was a little too much sativa
[01:24:57.420 --> 01:25:02.300]  I catch myself i'll take a dab and then I don't know how I do it, but i'm on instagram suddenly
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:03.980]  I don't know what happened
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:09.180]  I'm standing just in the middle of a hallway or in the middle of the kitchen people are just flowing around you
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:14.300]  Yeah, and i'm just instagramming like a motherfucker and don't even know it like what was going on here in my head a minute ago
[01:25:14.300 --> 01:25:19.980]  And what am I supposed to be doing? So I don't dab during the day sometimes but when I do bro, uh a dab
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:25.500]  Once I start dabbing, uh, it's game on uh, you gotta keep your dabs per hour high once you start
[01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:29.660]  Dph deep that sounds dirty. Don't say it like that
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:32.060]  Don't say it like that
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:36.380]  So guys we're gonna talk about uh, i've got some news articles. I want to read we're gonna talk about some jamaican stuff
[01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:40.620]  I'm gonna mention something about ladybugs that a listener emailed me about
[01:25:41.180 --> 01:25:43.820]  Um, and if we have time I might talk about my bokashi bucket
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:47.020]  I'm, not sure how far we're gonna get with all the uh news articles that I found
[01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:53.420]  Uh, one thing I do want to mention it's our birthday. What what episode 60 is the one year anniversary of the podcast?
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:55.180]  Thanks, mike. Great, man
[01:25:55.180 --> 01:25:58.460]  I was wondering when this was actually going to come around. I didn't know how you were gonna do it
[01:25:58.620 --> 01:26:04.780]  This will be out like march 29th, I think and I think today the 28th is the day that the first episode was ever released
[01:26:04.940 --> 01:26:09.420]  Awesome. So let's let's take some dabs for the birthday and then we'll read some commercials. All righty
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:15.280]  Um, i'll give you guys the option. I've got some sfv og i've got gorilla glue and i've got lemonade
[01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:18.000]  Oh, which one should we dab here?
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:25.920]  you already know that i'm i'm gonna pitch towards the sfv because it is a it is a dank strain from turpex and
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.680]  Yeah, you said lemonade and my tongue did a thing. All right
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.680]  That's the one I haven't tasted yet
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:34.080]  So I mean i'm sure that by the end of the show we're gonna dab all three
[01:26:34.080 --> 01:26:38.800]  Let's start with the sfv and then uh, we got to give mike a little baby dabs, but we'll start with the sfv
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:42.640]  Um, this is the san fernando valley cush made popular
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:48.400]  Oh, I don't even know. Uh, it's really popular from the cali connection is who put out the seeds but
[01:26:48.720 --> 01:26:50.880]  Uh people are gonna be like they didn't make it popular
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:57.440]  But they put out the seeds of the sfv and uh, it's a great breeding strain. It tastes good. It's a super nice high
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:03.120]  Uh turpex blasted extracted this and everything turpex does is quality. They change their labels
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.520]  I like their new logo shout out also check out their new website and they do a hell of a job
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:10.080]  Dude, i've been driving around in my car
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.380]  And just randomly like i've got to rats i'd be like no melt nebraska
[01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:19.920]  For the past seven to ten days. That's all three of us. Oh, man. My wife has no idea my wife
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:24.800]  But she has no idea what it is
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.640]  But she's definitely heard it like every every time i'm sitting in there hitting the bowl
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:33.200]  It's it just it comes out whether there's no melt or not. Um, so yeah
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:36.720]  I've got maybe another day before I get the deadpan look from mine
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:40.480]  All right, stop pause the song explain what the fuck are they talking about
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:44.640]  It's like the eighth time i've heard this I need to know as I was setting up for the podcast
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:48.240]  I was reading a news article and mike just i'm gonna give you a listen and hit play
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.000]  I was like, what are you giving me? Oh shit
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:53.280]  Okay, and he's playing the no melt theme song in the intro in my head, man
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.360]  I've got it. You got to play it to get it out of your head, right?
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:59.280]  Yeah, you download it to your phone. Don't you see you have it forever? Yep. You have it forever
[01:27:59.840 --> 01:28:04.080]  Yeah, that would be is that song number three on your phone because I know your playlist
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:09.440]  I've got like most of the episodes of the podcast and then I have that new afro man cut
[01:28:10.080 --> 01:28:13.200]  Because I got high because that's just that's the only song on your phone, right?
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:16.160]  The only song i'm gonna put some order back to this show. Um
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.680]  The sfv were dabbing
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:24.240]  It tastes delicious. It made me cough a little that's my fault as a big dab. It tastes really, uh
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:27.440]  It's earthy cushy, maybe a hint of coffee
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:29.760]  uh
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:32.960]  Yeah, it's got a good nice earthy cushy flavor. I definitely approve. I like it
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:38.640]  Uh, it's not a sativa that's for sure it made my eyes go and it made me get a little slow
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.680]  I approve I approve i'm gonna have to smoke a sativa here in a minute. So i'm glad this is um
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:48.080]  Interested in this lemonade my new favorite turp extra at least this run this time
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:53.920]  Uh, I smoked quite a bit of sfv between the water hash and what was the chem on what the buddies?
[01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.040]  What my buddy smoke, you know? Yeah the last I got four grand. I got four flavors last time
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.040]  I got the lemonade I got the chem dog
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:04.800]  The gorilla glue and uh, the one I got was the chemine g
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:11.360]  Oh, yeah, and that chemine g was it's gone now if that tells you anything, right? It was my favorite dude
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:16.960]  It was so turpy. So that nectar was good then that was it was definitely delicious the flavor on it was insane
[01:29:17.120 --> 01:29:20.320]  The flavor on this is pretty killer too with the flavor of that chemine stuff
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.480]  I didn't um, I noticed through this like I mean, I didn't just hack off of that and it wasn't a huge dab but
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.200]  this
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:34.400]  And it yeah, it made me feel in it it yeah, it made me feel good so I was yeah i'm nice and mellow now
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.240]  I definitely have heavy eyes
[01:29:36.240 --> 01:29:40.960]  i've noticed that I don't get the eye high from dabs like I used to when I would smoke just flowers in red or
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:44.160]  um, you know when you your eyes just get droopy and they just feel
[01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.800]  Like fucking back in the day, dude
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:50.400]  Your eyes would just get so heavy and everyone would look at you and be like you're so high bro
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:55.920]  Open your eyes, you know like I can't uh dabs seem to make me bug-eyed like it's so intense that i'm like
[01:29:56.240 --> 01:30:01.760]  I'm on edge with it and I kind of miss the the eye high and i'm getting that from this. Uh sfe right now
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.280]  All right, while i'm dabbed out of shit. Did everybody get a dab? You got one right? You're not coughing dude. What happened?
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:11.360]  Appropriately sized dab. Yeah, mike's got to take dabs for ants over there
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:17.440]  We've been rambling for a minute I do need to do two commercials somebody's gonna shout out to burn

[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:39.920]  I will have something prepared. I will speak about something. I don't know what it'll be yet
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:44.240]  Uh, jesse and I will collaborate and talk about what needs to be discussed if you've got an idea
[01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:48.080]  And you're coming to the meeting let me know what you'd like me to talk about at the grow meeting

[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.720]  And I I felt like at the last grow meeting like a lot of stuff was talked about
[01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.000]  Pretense, but then when it came down to who's got any questions
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:03.680]  Everybody was maybe a little embarrassed to speak up in front of the crowd and it wasn't
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:08.640]  It's because you're in a community of growers and I don't I don't think that should be the place to be embarrassed
[01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.960]  That's the place to get help. True. Yeah
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.560]  But nobody wanted to show that they were yellow belts when they were fifth degree black belts in the room
[01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:19.040]  Absolutely a lot of talent there. It would it would have been rough to be the first kid to say i've got a
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:24.480]  Question recommended that we write down questions and put them in a hat and that way nobody knows who
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.120]  Yeah, nobody knows who brought us that silly ass question. Which one of these dudes doesn't know how to do this
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:33.600]  You're gonna get a lot of that. Yeah, but we'll act we got to treat them
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:37.040]  The whole reason we're meeting is to spread knowledge to everybody
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:39.040]  Is at one point everyone man

[01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.220]  There we go. I'm better mike has the privilege of uh,
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:53.460]  Taking my old soil out of the pot and putting it into the recycling bin for soil. It's a serious privilege bitches
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:57.380]  Dear tay mover. Yeah, I get to play with dirt all day
[01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:04.900]  Um, did you see and in the past 20 pots that we have harvested? Have you seen a massive increase in my root mass?
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:12.420]  Yeah, the the amount of root material in these pots is insane lately people i've been i've been breaking up dirt pots for
[01:34:13.460 --> 01:34:16.900]  Fucking disgustingly long amount of time now that I think about it. But uh
[01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:20.340]  everybody's been breaking up an old pot and had like
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:26.820]  A handful of little tiny sad ass root there and lately you've got to smash the root ball against the wall for a little bit
[01:34:26.820 --> 01:34:28.820]  Just to get some dirt back
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:32.740]  It's been intense and they're not in there any longer. You're gonna say well, you just let them grow more time
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:36.980]  No, they're actually in there shorter because I ran this crop really quickly. I wanted to get some pictures
[01:34:37.860 --> 01:34:42.020]  They're not getting root bound. There's just an insane amount of incredibly healthy root material
[01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:45.460]  And see that's kind of what I was pointing out is like if you're using that
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:49.140]  Would it be better to kind of transplant more?
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.700]  You know
[01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:53.300]  more often or
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:59.780]  Just because we don't a larger pot would have been helpful, but it wasn't necessary. It wasn't to that point a larger pot from the
[01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:04.500]  Get go. I wouldn't necessarily say transplanting more frequently would be a good thing. There's a lot of stress
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:09.220]  But uh, you know, we've gotten it down not to brag on ourselves
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:14.340]  We can transplant some shit where there's like zero stress where the plants are even happier. They're like, oh, that was great
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:17.060]  Right. They just get to stretch a little more at the right time
[01:35:17.060 --> 01:35:21.140]  So once you guys get comfortable, I like to go myself. I go from the cloner into
[01:35:21.700 --> 01:35:26.340]  Uh a cup actually i've been introduced to a new product that I really like. It's just called a clone cup
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:29.140]  You can order them. I check them out on instagram. I don't know where to order them
[01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:32.820]  They were kicked down to me as a gift for a trial a trial and I really like them
[01:35:32.820 --> 01:35:35.540]  They're harder than a normal cup. They're a little bigger than a normal cup
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.100]  They're raised a little and they've got holes
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.740]  Uh to where they can drain a little bit better. So the clone cup company
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:43.460]  I really like those if you guys are listening I could use like
[01:35:44.100 --> 01:35:45.460]  90 of them
[01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:47.540]  90 would be cool
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:53.460]  So I go the solo cups you got to poke them yourself and they squeeze together when you try to scoop dirt into them
[01:35:53.460 --> 01:35:57.940]  These cups i'm saying a lot harder. You can wash them and reuse them. You don't have to keep going to walmart
[01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:03.620]  Yeah, you know so I go from the cloner into that cup and then I let it get kind of
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:08.260]  Kind of close to root bound in that cup, but not I just want to see the thick roots on the outside
[01:36:08.340 --> 01:36:09.860]  If I picked up the dirt, I want to see roots
[01:36:09.860 --> 01:36:11.860]  But I don't let the plant start to stretch in there
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:16.260]  And then I go to a three gallon and then sometimes if i'm doing like a breeding a pheno hunt
[01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.860]  I'll run them in three i'll flower them out in the three gallon when they're real short
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:24.260]  If i'm going bigger i'll throw them into a seven gallon and flower them out in a seven
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:26.900]  And I went the same amount of time. I just added
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:33.220]  Grokashi worm castings the dragonfly earth medicine root dust the black one. I can't think of the name. The bottle's not over here
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.300]  um
[01:36:35.300 --> 01:36:38.200]  Just simple stuff like that and I did a little bit of fish hydroslate
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:44.520]  And uh, i've started to cut out the ogt i'm not using ogt now, okay, dude, my roots were huge
[01:36:44.920 --> 01:36:48.540]  Super duper huge. I could have used a bigger pot, but I don't think it was necessary
[01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:53.080]  I think I did the right amount of time. They weren't root bound, but the roots were spaghetti
[01:36:53.080 --> 01:36:55.640]  Like I just know that since we've started using them
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:36:57.960]  having them in cups
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.560]  is almost like
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:01.560]  Uh, is it is it? Okay today?
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:04.520]  Is it okay today? Yeah, you know, it's you're literally
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:09.800]  You have to be on your stuff because if you leave them they're gonna cut away quick
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.240]  And that's I mean regular plants do but with the the worm casting it is it's fierce
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:17.080]  So i'm gonna go out of order a little bit
[01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:21.960]  I know I said I had a bunch of news but since we're talking about all this organic stuff another thing that i've noticed
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:26.280]  That has really contributed to the improvement in my plants
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.800]  I use it in my bedroom. I use it in my flowering room
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:34.680]  Everything but the clones gets it the clones get it now as soon as they go into the dirt. I feed it this
[01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:37.800]  Uh sean gave me something called a bokashi bucket
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:42.840]  The bokashi bucket is basically a five gallon bucket with a piece of
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:47.880]  A piece of plastic as a catch or a shelf in there then that shelf has holes in it
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:52.520]  And then underneath that shelf is a spigot and the idea is that you throw
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:54.760]  We'll talk about more in a minute with more detail
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.880]  There and it starts to get funky and then you can
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:03.640]  Turn the spigot and get the shit out is why that little shelf is in there you get juice out of it juice juice nasty
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:10.840]  It's like a miniature compost pile juicer. Okay, so the best way I could and set up like a gatorade
[01:38:11.480 --> 01:38:15.720]  Great way because I was going way i'm taking way a different way. So you take the bokashi bucket
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.400]  and
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:21.640]  When I got mine, I put the little shelf in there and it's got a little shelf that you put down some of them
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:24.280]  Have it pre-fixed there's different models of the bucket that you get
[01:38:24.440 --> 01:38:28.280]  So there's a little shelf in there with holes in it. I put down a thin layer of newspaper
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.800]  Just one sheet of newspaper so that I made more of a screen
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:36.700]  And then I put a small layer of the bokashi down. It comes with some powdered stuff called bokashi
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:41.720]  I sprinkled about a handful of that on the screen. And then what you do is you just put I put
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:48.280]  I'm a vegetarian and every banana that I eat has a banana peel every strawberry that I eat has that little
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:53.320]  The leafy part at the end of it, uh, there are some strawberries that come in the package that are inedible
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:55.160]  Every time you I eat an onion
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.800]  The way I clean my onion is I chop each end off of the onion
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:00.200]  And then I can get that onion skin right off of it
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.440]  And so i've got an end of each or each end of it and the onion skin and then I clean it
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:08.120]  Uh that ends and the skin go into my little bowl
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:12.600]  And then once i've got this bowl filled I throw all my banana peels my egg shells
[01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:17.080]  My onion ends my carrots that got funky the celery that I forgot to eat
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:22.280]  Uh coffee grounds are you have to dry them set them out and let them dry first if you're gonna do that
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.560]  But I do my yerba mate that i've cooked or that i've used
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.160]  And my coffee grounds you gotta set them on a paper towel and let them dry for like 48 hours
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.160]  You don't want to put too much moisture in there
[01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:32.040]  um
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.000]  I could explain why but it's too much to go into anything fruit or veggie
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:38.120]  What else can go in there? You can put uh meat and dairy in there
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:41.160]  Can you you can put your meat and dairy products and bread in there?
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:45.240]  I choose not to put I don't eat any meat or dairy and I only put a little bit
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:49.720]  It'll be weird if your steak's got or if your plants got pork chops and steak and you didn't right
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:52.040]  Yeah, yeah, and that just doesn't even happen in this house
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:53.560]  They're none of that comes here
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:59.400]  And I just put the vegetables and the fruits and shit in there and all the like some grapes and so there's apple cores and potato
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:00.360]  peels
[01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:05.960]  So you put uh, they say to put a two inch layer of food waste in there and then sprinkle a handful of the bokashi
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:10.680]  And then another two inch layer and sprinkle a handful of okashi and try not to open it very often
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.680]  I throw all of my scraps into a bowl and once the bowl has starts to sneak up the kitchen
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.920]  Then I put that in the bokashi bucket, right?
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.480]  Uh, mike you've been here when I opened the bucket
[01:40:20.440 --> 01:40:23.960]  I don't recommend going full work and keeping it in your kitchen like some people
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:28.840]  You can keep it in there. Just don't open it up to put the scraps in there when you pop the lid on that sucker
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:35.640]  It is ripe. It would you were you can smell the magic. We're fermenting banana peels apple cores
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:39.400]  Uh grapes, there are eggshells in there
[01:40:40.040 --> 01:40:45.480]  Uh, there's avocados in there like everything the juice that comes out of the novels. Yeah
[01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:50.600]  So you keep putting you keep packing your fruit and vegetables in there or your food waste?
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:52.760]  You can put your bacon and eggs in there if you want to
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.760]  Uh, all your food waste can go in there
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:58.440]  Then you pack it down with this little packer and keep sprinkling in the kashi and then you seal it right?
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:00.840]  And then after about it took me about 10 days
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:06.280]  About 10 days you unscrew the spigot that's on there and I put a mason jar underneath it and this
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:12.760]  Juice comes out and it starts off clear and kind of pink or orange-ish and it smells like
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.800]  It is like the bar trash can that got thrown up in and left in the sun
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.720]  I feel like it should be a game in the podcast
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.880]  You should just have the jar sitting here and people be like, what is this and you should just be like, I don't know
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:29.800]  The jar is sitting you can see the jar I can see the jar and I don't want no part of it
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.880]  I don't want to be part of this game
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.040]  The juice that comes out of there I throw that into a thing of
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:40.860]  Clean water with a bubbler and it bubbles up real good and it makes the stinkiest
[01:41:41.240 --> 01:41:46.840]  Funky shit and I feed that to my plants and I can see them dance around. We have a lid on our bucket
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:49.240]  Yeah, yeah
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:52.920]  That was a quick hole and just slide the tube through and just that's the end of that story
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:42:00.040]  Nope, it's uh, the plants love it people but good god, it's it's right. Yeah, it is stinky
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.560]  It's definitely a real delicate stomach. Well, kashi might not be for you, but it's the plants are loving it
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:09.000]  So more details i'll fill it up. It's almost to the top now
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:12.840]  I feel like i've got one more good dump of my bowl of banana peels
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:15.240]  I eat a lot of bananas you guys have a banana addiction
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:18.840]  I think they're really good for me and they give me a lot of energy and they're healthy and they're organic and I can eat
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:21.400]  Them in like a million ways i've been eating the shit out of bananas
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:26.520]  So shout out to bananas, but i've got one more dump into there and then once I dump that bowl into there
[01:42:27.160 --> 01:42:29.720]  I'm out of kashi so I won't even be able to put more kashi in there
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:34.360]  I'll seal it and let it seal for about 14 days and everything that's in there is essentially pickling
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.840]  That's like fermenting and pickling in there and i'll pull out juice out of there
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:43.960]  I'll get a lot of that. I call it kashi juice. I'll probably get five six, maybe eight to ten
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:49.160]  Uh, depending on how I don't know how soggy the top layer is gonna get i'll get eight to ten jars
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:56.120]  Hopefully of that kashi juice out of there and then I will take two large kiddie pools of soil
[01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:02.840]  And I will put half of that kashi bucket on the bottom of one kiddie pool and half of the kashi bucket on another kiddie
[01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:09.320]  Pool and cover that up with store bagged soil and mix that shit in and then in like 14 to 21 days
[01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:15.880]  We'll have some dank composted soil. I just watched mike eyes like immediately go pointed inwards like wait a minute
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:18.440]  Didn't I say i'm the one that messes with the soil?
[01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:22.520]  You just wait for that bath time, okay
[01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.880]  Two kiddie pools one one with grokashi brokashi. Yep, and then the other with
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:32.600]  Oh, it's I know it's gonna be worm castings, too. I know the plants love it
[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:37.480]  It's where there won't be any worm castings in there just yet. But in the future there will be castings added to that same soil
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:38.760]  Yes, indeed
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:44.120]  Yes, and that soil will get that'll just be the base like we'll only need a little bit of that soil
[01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:49.400]  Per the regular soil mixing bin. We'll just cut it down. Yeah, and it'll make some dank soil
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:53.160]  There'll be a lot of microbes in there. Yep. Yeah, mike does not look excited
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:04.120]  So between the worm to ruin like that day, yeah, yeah, yeah just wear something you don't like between the worm castings
[01:44:04.520 --> 01:44:06.280]  uh the grokashi
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:10.440]  Um, what else are we using fish hydroslates and the dragonfly earth medicine?
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:14.440]  You should see the roots on my plants and the veg growth happening in my plants
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.280]  There are other things that we still have to supplement and stuff, but my roots are amazing
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:23.180]  I'm, super impressed and i'm making my own shit. I can make with a handful of worm castings
[01:44:23.720 --> 01:44:27.240]  uh with one jar of that kashi tea with uh
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.680]  15 scoops of grokashi which sounds like a lot. It's 10 scoops of grokashi. There's never enough
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:36.120]  No, no, there's you can't really can't hurt yourself
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:38.440]  I mean you can but and if you want to use molasses
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.120]  It's like just like five ounces if you don't want to use molasses, you don't need it
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:47.720]  But you could make I made 25 gallons of nutrients with just that right there and it was amazing
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.800]  It was totally amazing green plants green happy plants all my veg plants all my clones that got put into new pots
[01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:59.960]  They all got fed that and they look completely happy. They love life. Everything is pretty much been switched over to organic
[01:45:00.040 --> 01:45:02.840]  So it's yeah, so that's a good way you guys to
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:08.680]  Recycle all of your garden stuff. That's a good way or all your garden stuff all your waste all your food waste
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:12.600]  What the heck happened to my papers? They all land in the wrong order. They're backwards and it's weird. I'm confused
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:13.960]  I don't know what to do anymore
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:15.640]  Switched it around
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.720]  I'm gonna try to fix it without anybody noticing right?
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.480]  So just take your food scraps and throw it in there and you can make your own nutrients guys
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:26.280]  We can save the world one, uh one drink at a time one food at a time one. Yeah
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:29.000]  I've seen three people put with these
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:31.160]  paper towels
[01:45:31.160 --> 01:45:35.560]  And uh Kleenex and stuff in there too because the it's paper it'll biodegrade in there
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:39.160]  I know you looked at me like that's disgusting but I mean it's rotten banana
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:43.000]  Already pretty damn gross. Yeah, it's gross but
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.960]  it's not is
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:49.080]  I'm, not looking forward to smelling the industrial size one
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:54.600]  Uh, there's a video it's not the uh, I was looking for the grokashi website I couldn't find theirs
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.920]  There's another guy that does it in 55 gallon drums and he runs farms
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:04.920]  Oh sitting there picturing a row of 55 gallon drums in the big solid bowl size
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:10.280]  At that point you don't smell he's dumping it into five gallon buckets and missing a portion of each one
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:13.400]  Yeah all over his feet. No, you don't smell it at that point
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:20.680]  What's what's that town to the east of here, you know the town i'm talking about where it's just cows like crammed into fences
[01:46:21.560 --> 01:46:24.360]  They sell them there or something. I don't know. It was horrible. You could taste
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:26.120]  cow
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:28.120]  Yummy, that's kind of how greeley smells
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:34.760]  No, really it's kind of kind of cow poopy. All right, so I received an email. Let me uh, where the heck here is my phone
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.920]  I have to find this email. This is the ladybugs i've been hearing about this is the ladybug email
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.000]  I want to talk about I learned a little bit about emails i'm searching for this message
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.440]  Here it is said I learned a little bit about emails, huh?
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:52.760]  Those are the words that just came out well, that's right. I'm multitasking don't laugh at me or do shit
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:47:00.200]  Dude, you know yesterday bro. I got hit in the head so hard that I don't remember half of my evening and i'm not even joking
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.640]  uh
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.440]  We were at a friend's house. Who did you deserve it? No, it was an accident
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:07.000]  There's I did it to myself. So it's even funnier
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:10.520]  There are two stairs that dip down into this uh other part of these people's house
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:17.880]  And right above the stairs there's a like a fuck there's a a beam a head thing like a fucking what is like a face smasher
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:21.240]  A head smasher. Yeah, dude. There's like a decorative awning thing there
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:25.560]  And uh, the architect was like tall people. I don't I don't remember hitting it
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:26.760]  I did not feel it
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:31.640]  All I remember is getting up off the ground and sean looking at me going dude. Are you okay? And I was like, I think so
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:33.240]  and I
[01:47:33.240 --> 01:47:35.240]  Continue on has never had that problem
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:36.680]  Right
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:39.480]  So I continued to my I can't I was going to pick up a chair
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.360]  So I went and got the chair and took it to where I was getting when I set it down
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.480]  I felt drunk. I was like I am fucked up right now
[01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:49.720]  Everything was gray and smith's like you want to dab a little bit like a big one, dude
[01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.560]  I felt weird all night
[01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.720]  I had someone come hang out with me last night and they were like you're like loopy and I was like I told you I
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:57.560]  Got hit in the head hard
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:48:00.200]  Like dude, it was so crazy smacked on my ass
[01:48:00.680 --> 01:48:02.200]  Look face smash
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.320]  I'm like
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:05.080]  I don't even I didn't feel it. I didn't feel it
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:08.520]  It didn't hurt until like when I sat down later because I got hit so hard
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.600]  I just went out my body was like sleepy
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:13.880]  Like I was on the floor at spence's house just laying there. It was like
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:19.160]  We've all had one of those. It was good, dude. It was pretty good. It happens a lot in this town
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:23.560]  There's a lot of short everybody was pretty worried about me look on their faces, dude
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:27.640]  It was loud like they all stood up and shit like what the fuck was that? It was good
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.120]  What the hell was I gonna talk about ladybugs i'm way distracted yes suddenly I feel like I got a head injury again
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:35.080]  Uh, so this dude he asked me not to say his name
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:38.040]  There's parts of this email that I won't read because some of it was just for me
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:44.920]  But he opens with first of all, thanks for the awesome pod. Love your style and mystic roots were a perfect fit for bed music
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:50.120]  You're welcome to read this on the pod, but please don't mention my real name. Just use vape dad on reddit
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.840]  Uh very active in r slash trees
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.120]  Then he talks about his soil where he is and then he says
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:01.320]  I was reading a book called cannabis cultivation the other day at barnes and noble and they recommended putting ladybugs
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:05.640]  Uh in our greenhouse to fight aphids and caterpillars and a whole assortment of pests
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:10.760]  So i'm researching organic growing for no other reason than I like the all-natural aspect of it
[01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:17.160]  Thinking uh thinking like this. I was wondering would it be a good idea to raise loose ladybugs in your grow room?
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.000]  What could they hurt in the stages of growth if anything or could these be
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.800]  Nature's pest control for those aspiring to care give this may be a dumb question
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:30.600]  But I just wanted to ask a live person with some real quantifiable growing experience again
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:34.920]  Thanks for the pod and keep it up. It's a really beautiful thing you're doing
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:40.680]  By the way, I hope you get invited to the joe rogan experience pod one day, but I know your plants would miss you
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:44.120]  Thanks for all the great free grow info much. Love
[01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:46.040]  vape dad
[01:49:46.040 --> 01:49:51.240]  Because I see his real name that that email at all. I don't know. Okay, I just wanted to make sure that I did not
[01:49:51.800 --> 01:49:55.560]  Um, i'm pretty high, but I don't think you did either. I don't think so so many cool things
[01:49:55.640 --> 01:50:00.920]  Uh, dude, you're welcome for all the free grow info. I am proud and happy to do that. My goal is to uh,
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:06.040]  Quit growing all the mids start fucking eliminating all the no mountain nebraska and get everybody growing
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:10.920]  Everybody needs to be growing high quality cannabis and all I have to do is talk into a microphone
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.320]  So i'm really excited to do that. You're very welcome
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:19.880]  Um joe rogan experience podcast dude if I got there, I don't know what I would do. I'd be super stoked to do it
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.040]  Just sit there and grin into the microphone
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:27.000]  That's probably what I would do. I'd love to be on that show with ari and joey diaz
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:29.560]  and joe rogan
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:33.000]  I'd be the hate the hate that would come from that
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:35.560]  Oh, man
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:37.560]  Fuck you haters, but i'd love to be on that
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:41.640]  Um, so let's get to the point here and dude you said this may be a dumb question
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:45.800]  No dumb questions, bro. Never no dumb questions at all. You gotta start somewhere
[01:50:45.800 --> 01:50:50.840]  I I had training wheels at one point and now i'm doing wheelies and you just got to start somewhere. There are no dumb questions
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:52.280]  um
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.080]  My theory on ladybugs and michael probably backed me up on this
[01:50:55.560 --> 01:51:00.120]  A long time ago. I did what I thought was cute and I went to the hydro store and I bought a thousand ladybugs
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:05.400]  Yeah, i've been thinking about your experiment while you were reading the email opened up the container and let them fly about the grow room
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:11.160]  And they were cute. I got out the camera and took pictures of ladybugs fucking on my plants and it was really cool
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:14.920]  Yep, didn't see adams. Yep been there. They sell 300
[01:51:15.560 --> 01:51:18.360]  The lights went out and then the next day I released what was it?
[01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:23.800]  1500 something like that. Yeah. Yeah, it looked like the envelope the t-shirt from amazon shows up
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.600]  Yeah, he just opened that fucker and dumped so the next morning
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:30.760]  If I if I released 1500 of them the next morning there were 50 alive in that bitch
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:36.360]  Yeah, they fly into all your fans. They fly up into your lights. Yep. So here's something that sean taught me
[01:51:36.680 --> 01:51:41.800]  Uh credit to sean king cola, he taught me this and i'm gonna butcher it because I had a head injury that night
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.760]  Ladybugs
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:50.760]  Don't see in the same spectrum as humans ladybugs see a uv spectrum that's only provided by the light
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:53.800]  So when we take a ladybug and we put it in a grow room
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.920]  All it sees is a grow light and it all it doesn't see it
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.360]  It it's confused now and it wants to get toward the light that it can see
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.000]  And it's warm and the warmth and so it flies into your hoods
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:08.360]  It flies into your fans and you get to sweep them all up and they smell terrible. Yeah, I
[01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:13.240]  months cleaning ladybugs out of every little corner and looking
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:17.720]  Cranny in that fucking grow and then you'd find them in weird places randomly, too
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:22.440]  And they didn't do much. Uh, there are predatory mites that are worth it
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:28.040]  Uh that work indoors, but I don't think that ladybugs, uh, praying mantis are cool indoors
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:32.520]  They don't run away and ladybugs are also hard to find migratory creatures. They want to take off
[01:52:32.600 --> 01:52:33.480]  They don't want to be there
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:37.640]  They want to eat and then they want to fly away and then they want to eat and they want to fly away. Yeah, so
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:43.240]  In my honest opinion, uh, I would say no on the ladybugs in an indoor situation
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:46.440]  If you have a greenhouse or an outdoor situation and you're ready to keep
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.400]  You're gonna have to keep adding to them and you're also gonna have to feed them
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:54.520]  Uh, they do require food even if there are aphids and shit there like you don't want to eat
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.520]  Hummus and falafel all day you need to change so you got to provide them some kind of food
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:02.760]  So keep that in mind if you're going to use them in an outdoor or greenhouse situation but indoors
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:10.120]  I would not do the ladybugs and then that food could also bring other pests. That's very likely very likely at this point
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.880]  I tell people to release them around their their grow not in their grow room at this point
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:17.880]  So they sprinkle them in the front and backyard
[01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:19.400]  It don't bother with them
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:24.920]  Otherwise just as like an extra preventative measure and the thing about the mantises i've been in a few pet stores here
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:28.200]  In colorado like you guys carry mantis and i'm expecting to like
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.200]  See a whole
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:33.080]  You know fish tank full of mantises and like yeah, i'll take 30 of them
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:38.440]  It's it's not there. You gotta order them. They'll send you eggs and then you gotta let the eggs hatch
[01:53:39.320 --> 01:53:43.980]  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Um, there's a website. I think i'll have to buy a co.com arbico.com
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:50.380]  Go there arbico organics, uh, dude, they've got all kinds of great shit. They'll send you bugs. They'll send you nematodes
[01:53:51.260 --> 01:53:56.140]  Some of it is seasonal so you might not be able to get everything but organic pest control at its finest
[01:53:56.220 --> 01:53:59.580]  They don't pay me to say that I just like sharing useful shit with people
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.860]  We've been going 32 minutes. I'd like to go about 45
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:06.300]  Maybe an hour at the most and I also want to read some news articles
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:08.380]  So you guys want to get into the news?
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:10.700]  I do but we can make uh
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:16.780]  Dab though you thinking so I kind of agree with you. I like the way mike thinks mike is on it
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:20.160]  I'm gonna take a drink here. Um, we're gonna dab some lemonade from turpex
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:24.540]  Uh, I think was it john john that recommended this to us? Absolutely. All right
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:27.740]  I'm gonna somebody talk for a second. He did uh when I was down there
[01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:31.020]  He didn't he had not had a sample of the review yet
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:37.820]  So he couldn't really give me an honest opinion, but the name was enticing but names can be misleading sometimes
[01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:41.340]  Yes, we all know about the name game. Obviously. So yeah, so
[01:54:42.060 --> 01:54:48.460]  Uh, it was interesting hearing about where the the handkerchief came from and that was that was i'm a gamer
[01:54:48.460 --> 01:54:51.580]  I'm mike's a gamer. That was a pretty fucking funny story because I didn't get it
[01:54:51.900 --> 01:54:56.860]  I'm, not really a big uncharted fan, but that was fucking hilarious like john. John. You're the man, dude
[01:54:56.860 --> 01:54:58.620]  Thanks for being on the podcast. I'm gonna go back up

[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:09.020]  Up there. So, uh, john john you need to be there again at the next episode. We'll give you your own mike
[01:55:09.180 --> 01:55:12.940]  I had one mike that was being passed around because there were a lot of people there, dude
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.020]  There were and you'd hear people would come in and out. Yeah
[01:55:15.100 --> 01:55:16.380]  Yeah, one guy would come in and hear hey

[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:38.220]  I listened to that episode. I was like damn. Why wasn't I there? Yeah. Uh, yeah. No, i haven't taken anybody to that place

[01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:12.460]  I don't wear a tie at city council. I'm not wearing one of the fucking trap

[01:56:26.780 --> 01:56:32.540]  I've uh, I watched a couple of their the the guys that were on the podcast the old world videos that they did on youtube
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:36.380]  And stuff they used to be on it all the time and I guess they got busy
[01:56:36.540 --> 01:56:41.820]  I mean you could obviously tell it's picked up business picked up from back in the day and they all got um

[01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:55.340]  tasty definitely tasty
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.740]  Lemon candy
[01:56:57.740 --> 01:56:59.420]  with uh
[01:56:59.420 --> 01:57:04.140]  It's another flavor that I can't yet describe it'll hit me in a minute, but it's definitely a sativa high. Uh
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:06.460]  Because my head is going
[01:57:06.460 --> 01:57:08.460]  And it made my eyes wobbly
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:12.940]  Which is something that only a couple of other strains have ever done to me wobbly eyed sativa hit. All right, here we go
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:17.100]  Damn, how big whoa, what was that? That was weird still sounds weird. Is that one of us?
[01:57:18.220 --> 01:57:22.860]  I think it's oh, it's that there we go. Oh my bad. No, it's just the email cord
[01:57:22.860 --> 01:57:26.620]  Sorry guys, that's what happens when the email cord touches the microphone or the headphone jack
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:30.860]  If you guys heard it at all, oh they did we sounded like robots for a minute there i'll try to fix it
[01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:33.340]  I'll fix it in post
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:39.020]  Yeah, I put half of it to my nose. It definitely has the high lemon terpene there. Yeah some candy
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:44.460]  So the name is worthy the candy. Yeah, the name is worthy. That's definitely some lemonade
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:49.100]  I'm just gonna go back for a little mini flavor. Yeah
[01:57:50.460 --> 01:57:52.460]  It looks like a wine
[01:57:57.580 --> 01:58:02.620]  They'll be hung up on that don't smoke tobacco people there you go, there it is. There's the psa. Yeah
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:06.700]  Dude, that was pretty smooth. You just worked the email cord the mic cable
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:10.140]  The e the carb cap a little bit of multitasking
[01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:13.100]  You can't handle it as my fucking lungs
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:19.020]  Yeah, can't smoke night. We all just took the same size dabs. I took a bigger dab than that and didn't choke
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:20.620]  tobacco
[01:58:20.620 --> 01:58:23.520]  Tobacco's fault say no to cigarettes my friends say no to cigarettes
[01:58:24.480 --> 01:58:28.320]  No butts down dabs up. Yeah, there you go. That sounds kind of weird
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.840]  um
[01:58:31.840 --> 01:58:35.840]  All right, let's do some news. We're at 37 minutes. Let's just do a couple of these news articles
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:38.080]  We'll save a couple for uh, maybe wednesday or something
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.640]  This one caught my attention. I actually want to give a big shout out to one of my facebook friends mike howley
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:50.320]  Uh, we used to call him bike howley. It could be michael howley, but uh, he's from boston. He's a mass hole
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:54.880]  He's a cool-ass dude to tell you the truth. He knows what's up with cannabis. He's uh educated
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.680]  He's smart. He can separate the bullshit from the truth
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:58:59.200]  um
[01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:02.560]  He should be more known in our cannabis community and I want to give him a shout out right now
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:06.560]  He probably doesn't listen to this show in any way, but huge shout out to mike by cowley
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:11.120]  Uh, you do a good job, bro. I appreciate all your facebook posts. I see how much you try to help
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:15.120]  And participate with our community and I fucking appreciate it. So shout out
[01:59:15.520 --> 01:59:21.840]  Uh, that's where I found out about this story, but it says pot pesticide contamination in denver grows the article is by william breathes
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:26.080]  And it says i'm gonna choke here in a second because I took a huge dab, but just bear with me
[01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:33.280]  Six marijuana grows in denver were ordered to quarantine and possibly destroy plant harvests after denver fire department officials determined that the grow
[01:59:33.280 --> 01:59:35.280]  Facilities weren't using chemicals properly
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.840]  Oh
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:43.760]  I tried so hard not to laugh and the harder I tried not to the worse it was
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:49.200]  Mike just moved away from the microphone to sneeze but head butted the mic stand with his sneeze
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:54.400]  That was fucking glorious. Just a little head, but I wish there was video for that
[01:59:55.040 --> 01:59:56.480]  all right, so
[01:59:56.480 --> 02:00:00.080]  Uh, they're not using chemicals properly bugs and pests were a fact of life for commercial growers
[02:00:00.080 --> 02:00:04.640]  But dealing with them appropriately is important because eventually humans will consume the pot
[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:10.340]  Earlier this month the city of denver released a bulletin warning grows our warning grows about the improper use of pesticides
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:18.080]  Because the fire department's recent discovery the city has ordered all licensed pot grows in the city to send in pesticide reports by april 1st
[02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:25.280]  Pesticides and agricultural chemicals must be used in accordance with the product label and with all applicable federal state and local laws
[02:00:25.680 --> 02:00:31.440]  And regulations improper use of pesticides on marijuana can raise serious public health concerns the bulletin reads
[02:00:32.080 --> 02:00:39.440]  The catch is that the federal agency in charge of regulating pesticide use the environmental protection agency doesn't have acceptable levels for use on cannabis
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:41.840]  Since cannabis is illegal on a federal level
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:49.140]  The colorado department of agriculture lacks official guidelines to beyond suggesting that growers not use any pesticides that haven't been specifically
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:52.560]  Tested labeled and assigned a set tolerance for pot growing
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:54.240]  now
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:59.680]  Anybody that's listened to this podcast for more than three or four episodes already knows what my solution to part of this problem is
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:05.600]  The environmental protection agency does not have acceptable levels for use on cannabis since cannabis is illegal on a federal level
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.680]  Let's think about this
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:09.680]  solution anybody
[02:01:09.740 --> 02:01:17.920]  Legalize cannabis. Yes. See that's your first step that will make this a little bit easier with legalization comes product safety people
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:25.280]  All right. Um, where was I the cda does have an unofficial list of pesticides that can be used on unspecified crops that are intended
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:29.520]  For human consumption. However, oh consumption. However, I kind of read that weird my fault
[02:01:29.680 --> 02:01:35.120]  And the state marijuana enforcement division has a strict list of allowed pesticides as well as instructions for how grow owners
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:42.580]  Have to store and dispose of them state law also requires that shops write up standard operating operating procedures for all pesticide applications
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:49.760]  In denver dispense reason will now be required to submit a list of every pesticide used and how much of it is used
[02:01:50.240 --> 02:01:53.760]  Copies of those records must be kept in the facility where the marijuana is grown
[02:01:54.080 --> 02:01:59.680]  Additionally grows must send lists of pesticides and information on their safety to the denver fire department and
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:05.120]  A sign must be placed on the door of every grow room listing any and all pesticides used
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.080]  Those businesses that don't comply could face fine could face fines and closures
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:12.820]  And let me tell you I work with a dispensary
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:17.120]  And i'm there on a daily on a semi-daily basis the past couple of weeks
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.560]  Dude, they are not joking when they say they're going to find you or close you they will come in that day
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:28.320]  They will find a violation that day. They will write a ten thousand dollar fine and they will close your shop down right on the spot
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.560]  Everybody that's here leave you're closed
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:36.160]  I've seen it happen not at the spot that I represent, but i've seen it happen to another place people don't get
[02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:42.880]  The the amount of regulation and oversight that this industry operates under I mean the med is massive. Yeah
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:45.920]  Uh when i'm hanging out near the bud room i'll hear people
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:50.720]  It's been a long time since anyone said it but you'll hear people or people that don't have an id that want to get in
[02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:55.840]  Can you just let me in just once it's like dude, this is a billion dollar operation
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.120]  I don't know exactly but I mean it's fucking more money than you could even imagine
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:04.240]  We're gonna risk all of our business for one dude to sneak through without his id every operation in town
[02:03:04.320 --> 02:03:07.520]  You can call a million dollar business. Yeah, it's all on camera
[02:03:07.680 --> 02:03:11.920]  Oh, I saw the price list for just some of the grow equipment that I ordered the other day
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:14.640]  I was like, yeah, we need like 30 of these and they're like
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:17.520]  That's this much and I was like
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:19.760]  Order it, but oh my god
[02:03:19.760 --> 02:03:22.320]  That's a house like we just spent a house on fans
[02:03:23.360 --> 02:03:24.640]  What the hell?
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:26.400]  Okay, I want to get more into this article
[02:03:26.400 --> 02:03:33.680]  It says the city also says that the denver department of public health and environment will be inspecting cultivation sites as well as infused product
[02:03:34.140 --> 02:03:37.840]  Manufacturing sites so what was happening you guys you heard the article
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:44.640]  There were some shops in denver some grows in denver that were using chemicals that should not have been being used on the
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:47.200]  Cannabis that they were selling to the public
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:51.040]  And it's my bet that the shops that were busting out those 75
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:54.400]  $99 ounces. It's probably those guys
[02:03:55.020 --> 02:03:58.080]  Probably they're just selling coupons on the fucking yeah
[02:03:58.960 --> 02:04:01.760]  The ones that you see in the back of the magazines and stuff. Yeah, those are
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:07.360]  Man, that's terrible that they're doing that and there's a the picture of this article makes it the best
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:12.240]  Uh, there's a picture of a guy in like a breaking bad suit with the full-on gas mask
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:19.040]  Toting weed out he's pouring a bottle of monsanto chemicals into another container and it's completely
[02:04:19.260 --> 02:04:23.120]  Unrelated to anything to do with the article. It's just a fear and hype picture is all it is
[02:04:23.280 --> 02:04:25.840]  Here watch i'll turn the computer this way. Uh, you gotta lean this way
[02:04:25.840 --> 02:04:31.040]  I've got too many things plugged in but look at this shit here full-on breaking bad suit chemical into chemical
[02:04:31.360 --> 02:04:36.160]  Nothing to do with cannabis or this article. It looks like glue. It looks like he's pouring glue
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:41.440]  Well eagle 20 looks like that if you've ever seen eagle 20 and I kind of assumed we talked about it friends and I eagle
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:47.280]  20 was probably one of the products being used in all of this bullshit if I read it right the shops that have their
[02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:48.540]  crops
[02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:49.920]  quarantined
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:54.480]  Right now turn themselves in essentially like they handed in their form that was due april 1
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:59.440]  Oh, wow, and when that they started looking at them, they were like, hey wait, that's on the whatever the list
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:02.720]  See i've been read that far. This is the only article i've seen about it
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:08.240]  There was another big change with hash the other day where they're like rescheduling it or something like that, too
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:10.720]  Wasn't there you got the news article? No, I do not. I'm, sorry
[02:05:11.840 --> 02:05:16.240]  I'm, sorry. Well, we'll look for that one on another episode. It wasn't even a smart ass to you. Sorry
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:20.880]  Did you hear about this one thing that i'm not prepared to talk about
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:26.080]  No, I did not this is our course not even a news correspondent adam gasking shows up unprepared
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.360]  Hi, boss. I'm high shit and unprepared good to see you
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:32.480]  It was actually on instagram
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.880]  But i'm not even gonna be able to find it so so this article is super long
[02:05:36.960 --> 02:05:40.560]  Let me see how much time i've got I might skip this one and we might give you guys a wednesday episode
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:41.520]  I've got us
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:45.840]  Roll over here to garage man. How far are we going? We're 45 minutes and we're not going to do this super long article
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:48.400]  We're going to save that this one i'm excited about
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:51.200]  You guys are gonna be like what?
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:56.720]  Is it more lube more lube? No, no, if you guys want to he's referring to the floria episode you guys
[02:05:56.720 --> 02:05:58.720]  This is not a weird bromance going on here
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:04.560]  All right. So I scroll down to the cannabis and this article is by david mcfadden of the associated press
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:06.080]  um
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:08.080]  There's a picture of
[02:06:08.080 --> 02:06:09.600]  bunny whaler
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:11.520]  lighting up a
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:15.920]  Big old bowl in front of a picture of king. Haile selassie. I and then to the right of him
[02:06:16.240 --> 02:06:20.000]  Is king haile selassie and the queen sitting right next to him?
[02:06:20.640 --> 02:06:26.960]  Uh great shot. So i'll get into i'll get to the point historic new gondolas in jamaica for rastafari religious use
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:29.440]  comma mmj program
[02:06:30.720 --> 02:06:38.800]  So kingston jamaica marijuana has been pervasive but illegal in jamaica for decades consumed as a medicinal herb puffed as a sacrament by
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:42.000]  Rastafarians and sung about in the island's famed reggae music
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:46.480]  After many years of dialogue about the culturally entrenched drug and embot
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:52.720]  Emboldened what and emboldened by changes to drug laws in u.s. States jamaica's parliament on tuesday
[02:06:53.280 --> 02:07:00.960]  Tuesday night gave final approval to enact decriminalizing small amounts of pot and establishing a licensing agency to regulate a lawful medical
[02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:03.180]  marijuana industry
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:05.860]  Yeah, so we got medical marijuana in jamaica
[02:07:06.500 --> 02:07:13.620]  Welcome to the club the historic amendments paved the way for a cannabis licensing authority to be established to deal with regulating and cultivating and
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:21.560]  Distributing and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes both houses of jamaica's legislature have approved this legislation
[02:07:22.740 --> 02:07:24.740]  What's so funny, bro?
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:28.020]  This is an awesome story that mountain dew was amazing
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:30.660]  He had some power to it
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:34.580]  He held that far from the mics and it was still like a shotgun in my ears. That was good
[02:07:34.740 --> 02:07:37.540]  I know people from the south to be like that's a good can of mountain dew
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:43.060]  When a beer opens like that, it's like that's a good can of beer. It's gonna be a good can of beer right here
[02:07:43.220 --> 02:07:46.900]  That's one of them special mountain. I don't think i've drinked a mountain. Dude. Yeah, see, uh,
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:50.980]  It's been over a year since i've had mountain dew I think yeah, that's probably since I was 16
[02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:54.420]  That was like getting off crack. That was my body went through a withdrawal for a minute there
[02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:58.660]  I've had the regular do and the foe do at home just in case I run out of the regular
[02:07:59.620 --> 02:08:01.780]  Yeah, he does make his own. He's got the little fizz machine
[02:08:02.580 --> 02:08:04.580]  So in a victory for religious freedom
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:12.180]  Adherence to the homegrown rastafari spiritual movement can now freely use marijuana for sacramental purposes for the first time on the tropical land
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:14.420]  Yes, I rastafari
[02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:20.260]  The law makes possession of up to two ounces of marijuana a petty offense that could result in a ticket but not a criminal record
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:22.800]  cultivation of five
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:25.120]  Mike
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:27.680]  Yeah
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.960]  I I like that. Well, they've got medical marijuana now and dude before if you got caught with cannabis in jamaica
[02:08:33.040 --> 02:08:37.280]  No, for sure. It was seven days in a jamaican jail and seven days in a jamaican jail
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:40.880]  I'd probably rather be 45 days in a pueblo jail to tell you the truth
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:46.640]  Like it's not gonna be anything fun. You sleep on the cement floor with the rats and you don't get no food. So
[02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:49.360]  Yeah, what else is new?
[02:08:50.240 --> 02:08:54.560]  All right, so, uh, what's two ounces petty offense you don't go to jail that's way better
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:59.040]  Five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted
[02:09:00.160 --> 02:09:01.920]  five ganja plants now
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:08.880]  Tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad will soon be able to apply for permits authorizing them to legally buy small amounts of jamaican
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:13.220]  Weed or ganja as it is known locally. That's fucking brilliant
[02:09:14.020 --> 02:09:20.900]  Marketing on behalf of the government to say 15 bucks so that you can fill your prescription while you're I don't oh god
[02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:23.620]  Why don't I say I don't have to bring it with me on the boat?
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:29.220]  But yeah, I can buy it while i'm there. Yep, not bring it back on your boat, you know, uh, but that's gonna be
[02:09:29.780 --> 02:09:31.780]  Reggae cruise. That's all i'm gonna say
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:36.820]  I don't know if anybody saw my instagram and facebook post about reggae cruise, but in november I think
[02:09:37.460 --> 02:09:41.220]  Uh, there's the biggest cruise with like 20 of my favorite reggae artists
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:46.580]  Uh, and they're going to jamaica and I that it's going to be even more fun now
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:47.380]  Okay
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:54.580]  on wednesday colorado-based united cannabis corp said it has launched a partnership with jamaican agencies to launch a marijuana research and development
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:10:00.500]  Development facility on the island that they hope will lead patents and medical cannabis products
[02:10:01.300 --> 02:10:08.100]  Uh peter bunting the island's national security minister said the legislation does not mean jamaica plans to soften its stance on
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:11.780]  transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:17.300]  Jamaica has long been considered the caribbean's largest supplier of pot to the u.s and regional islands
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:23.780]  The passage of this legislation does not create a free-for-all in the growing transporting dealing or exporting of ganja
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:30.820]  Security forces will continue to rigorously enforce jamaican law with our international treaty obligations bunting said in parliament
[02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:37.860]  Uh, william brownfield the u.s assistant secretary for counter narcotics affairs. Damn. I'm glad that's not my job
[02:10:37.860 --> 02:10:42.020]  That'd be a lot of work. I am william brownfield the u.s assistant secretary
[02:10:42.740 --> 02:10:44.740]  narcotics affairs
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:53.540]  So this dude told the associated press days before the vote that jamaican law is of course to make his own business and jamaica's
[02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:59.540]  And jamaica's sovereign decision, but he noted that the trafficking of marijuana into the u.s remains against the law
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:07.060]  We expect that jamaica and all states party to the un drug conventions will uphold their obligations including a firm commitment to combating and dismantling
[02:11:07.060 --> 02:11:11.700]  Criminal organizations involved in drug drug trafficking. He told ap in an email
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:16.520]  Um, once again you guys how do we stop illegal cannabis trafficking?
[02:11:18.180 --> 02:11:20.180]  Legalize it
[02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:25.860]  It's the only answer that makes any sense. That's the truth. What we need to do is buy a small plane at first
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:31.700]  And then we can we fly people straight from colorado to jamaica for a trip
[02:11:31.780 --> 02:11:34.180]  We just we're gonna have to stop somewhere in the middle
[02:11:34.820 --> 02:11:36.980]  Florida the smaller the plane the more frequently
[02:11:37.700 --> 02:11:39.700]  I'm telling you now if it's gonna be
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:45.060]  I'm just gonna keep reading before adam crashes a plane in a fantasy. Yep
[02:11:45.780 --> 02:11:47.780]  Just saying anybody's got the money
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:51.620]  From colorado to jamaica. Why there's a weed legal in both
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:57.220]  Uh, so anyway debate debate has long raged in jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja
[02:11:57.220 --> 02:12:03.320]  But previous calls to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana fizzled out because officials feared it would bring sanctions from washington
[02:12:04.420 --> 02:12:11.940]  Jamaican officials now have high hopes that the island can become a player in the nascent medical marijuana industry health tourism and the development
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:14.020]  of innovative pot derived items
[02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:18.840]  Local scientists already have a history of creating marijuana derived products such as canisol
[02:12:19.140 --> 02:12:25.300]  Which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glucoma patients. I like that how they say local scientists in jamaica
[02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:28.980]  You know some dude with dreadlocks sitting on a five gallon bucket making bubble hash
[02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:32.100]  well
[02:12:32.100 --> 02:12:37.220]  I i've seen quite a few people that are moving down that way as well a lot of popular people
[02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:41.380]  Yeah, I know you have to a lot of our friends went on a trip there just recently. Oh, really?
[02:12:41.540 --> 02:12:42.580]  Yeah, a lot of our friend well
[02:12:42.580 --> 02:12:43.380]  It was a couple months back
[02:12:43.380 --> 02:12:47.540]  But as soon as this happened when it was like coming up they went there and helped them put this shit in place
[02:12:47.700 --> 02:12:53.380]  Nice, some of the people from steve bill like addy. Uh, okay. Shout out adison adison tomorrow. What's up, brother?
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:57.380]  I think quite a few from up there in denver river rock area and stuff like that
[02:12:58.340 --> 02:13:00.340]  All right. I'm gonna keep reading. So, uh
[02:13:00.660 --> 02:13:07.220]  Where were I commerce minister anthony hylton said the cannabis industry holds great potential for jamaica where marijuana has long been grown illegally on
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:14.660]  Mountainsides and marshes the move by jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:21.860]  More than 20 us states allow some form of medical marijuana and last year colorado and washington legalized personal use
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:28.100]  On tuesday alaska alaska became the third u.s state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults
[02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:30.340]  In the americas euro
[02:13:30.340 --> 02:13:36.920]  Uruguay last year became the first nation to create a legal marijuana market in argentina personal possession of marijuana was decriminalized
[02:13:37.300 --> 02:13:42.280]  Under a 2009 supreme court ruling that jail time for small amounts of drugs violates the country's constitution
[02:13:42.980 --> 02:13:44.260]  That's fucking cool
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:51.780]  Uh, and while in chile permits use of medical marijuana details of jamaica's licensing authority and its hope for medical marijuana sector will need to be
[02:13:52.100 --> 02:13:56.980]  Refined in upcoming months, but for now jamaican cannabis crusaders applauded the amendments
[02:13:57.220 --> 02:13:59.060]  This is a big step in the right direction
[02:13:59.060 --> 02:14:05.780]  But there's still a lot of work to do said delano cyber right director of the cannabis commercial and medical task force
[02:14:06.260 --> 02:14:09.620]  So big up to jamaica you're taking steps in the right right direction
[02:14:10.420 --> 02:14:11.860]  so much more uh
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:14.260]  traveling and tourism is going to happen there because people
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:17.300]  Go there and get your medical marijuana now
[02:14:18.020 --> 02:14:20.180]  If they charge everybody like even five bucks
[02:14:20.580 --> 02:14:25.460]  To 15 bucks or whatever to be able to legally consume without not have to worry about it while they're there
[02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:30.820]  That's gonna be millions for the government just up taxes. California is like the only warm place that it's
[02:14:31.440 --> 02:14:37.540]  Semi-legal so like all those places in the summer we get 300 days of sunshine here. Yeah, but it's it's hot
[02:14:38.100 --> 02:14:42.020]  It's hot. Yeah, it does get pretty damn, you know, and I mean being closer to the equator
[02:14:42.100 --> 02:14:44.660]  I'm sure it's hot but that beach sure does help
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:46.740]  uh
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:50.580]  Yeah, so jamaica would be dope. Yeah, it would be yeah, I can't wait for that to happen
[02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:55.620]  I don't know when it goes into effect, but I want to go visit now and go take some dabs in jamaica
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:57.700]  I wonder if that's possible
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:00.100]  I'm sure they're down there already

[02:25:20.290 --> 02:25:25.170]  If you ask they'll probably give you a tour of the worm farm. You can see how the worms are made. It's pretty cool
[02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:27.910]  It's 411 tijuana street in colorado springs, colorado
[02:25:28.290 --> 02:25:32.450]  If you don't want to travel or if you're out of state, they will mail you worm castings
[02:25:32.450 --> 02:25:36.690]  They will mail you dragon flight earth medicine. They will ship to your front door
[02:25:37.170 --> 02:25:40.210]  Uh, I think you can get live worms or worm
[02:25:41.410 --> 02:25:43.410]  I forgot what they're called
[02:25:44.690 --> 02:25:49.170]  Man the baby worms something like that. I don't have the website pulled up. I should have been more prepared, right?

[02:26:00.050 --> 02:26:03.810]  It's keeping that red thing in your face where we need it be that microphone stands friend
[02:26:03.970 --> 02:26:05.730]  I don't like it get a zen moment with it
[02:26:05.730 --> 02:26:10.210]  All right, guys go to rocky mountain worm company.com and they will mail you cool shit. You have to pay for it

[02:26:19.410 --> 02:26:21.410]  Especially when they're sending you poop
[02:26:22.690 --> 02:26:24.690]  What do you get in the mail jimmy box and shit
[02:26:26.450 --> 02:26:30.850]  Shipping on this shit was straight from the rocking mountains the best shit on the market
[02:26:31.090 --> 02:26:32.290]  That's the truth
[02:26:32.290 --> 02:26:37.250]  Everyone I know that's growing right if you guys want to sponsor the show. I do do way better ads on monday episodes
[02:26:37.250 --> 02:26:40.450]  This is a wednesday episode. We're getting a little funky today. We're having a good time
[02:26:40.450 --> 02:26:44.450]  We had an equipment error right at the beginning of the show. So it's going to be a chaotic episode
[02:26:44.530 --> 02:26:46.530]  I want to go just like 30 minutes or so
[02:26:47.010 --> 02:26:50.290]  Um, if you want to sponsor the show send me an email. It's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[02:26:50.370 --> 02:26:52.370]  I'll get you all that information
[02:26:52.370 --> 02:26:55.410]  Uh, we'll get you all squared up if you got a product you want me to test out
[02:26:55.490 --> 02:27:01.090]  We like testing out new shit on the show. We need more email. We need an official email of the show
[02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:02.930]  I think
[02:27:03.570 --> 02:27:08.130]  Yeah, this one was a gift and a hookup from my good friend giddy at emotech so shout out to the gmail
[02:27:08.370 --> 02:27:11.010]  Okay, so i'll be real specific white mike needs an email
[02:27:11.570 --> 02:27:12.610]  Yeah
[02:27:12.610 --> 02:27:16.290]  White mike himself needs an email. You would never leave the house
[02:27:17.170 --> 02:27:20.770]  You would have no reason to come over here anymore. I would come over here to get shattered. I don't know
[02:27:21.970 --> 02:27:26.770]  Seriously, i've seriously been considering an uh inverter for my car for the email dude
[02:27:26.850 --> 02:27:32.450]  I saw that online and I cringed a little I saw it on instagram and I also surprised you don't have one brilliant
[02:27:32.610 --> 02:27:37.330]  Yeah, right. It's I know if I have a passenger that can hold on to it, so nobody gets burned
[02:27:37.410 --> 02:27:40.770]  It'll be awesome. But if you put it in the cup holder, it's your elbow is gonna hit that shit
[02:27:40.850 --> 02:27:44.450]  You're gonna have a ring right there and you're gonna need some apothecary pain cream to rub on there
[02:27:44.530 --> 02:27:46.530]  Gonna be on the news. This is the first car fire
[02:27:49.810 --> 02:27:53.650]  It's beautiful but then I think about the lady who hit autopilot in the rv
[02:27:55.090 --> 02:27:58.210]  Walked into the back of the rv and started taking dabs all over the highway
[02:27:58.370 --> 02:28:05.090]  Yeah, it's only a matter of time before some fucking dabbed out more on it bursting the flames sitting in a parking lot somewhere
[02:28:05.410 --> 02:28:09.570]  Yeah, uh, it's gonna be that one guy that ruins it for everybody. But hey until that happens
[02:28:09.890 --> 02:28:11.890]  Don't be that guy. Don't be that guy
[02:28:12.530 --> 02:28:19.730]  If anybody got my gutter reference you get a high five tcu baby. Oh, man. Nice. So the gorilla glue, huh, dude, it's tasty
[02:28:20.530 --> 02:28:23.090]  Uh shout out to turpex i'm dabbing. They don't sponsor the show or anything
[02:28:23.090 --> 02:28:28.770]  But I got some tasty, uh turpex gorilla glue shatter from green and healthy wellness. They sponsor my happiness
[02:28:29.410 --> 02:28:33.810]  Yeah, this this smile has been brought to you by our good friends at turpex and green and healthy wellness
[02:28:33.890 --> 02:28:36.370]  That was well put sir. Shout out to hunt and his womb room
[02:28:38.210 --> 02:28:43.090]  Hey get that meat wallet tight man, you guys are pulling out all the stops there was a lot of hash
[02:28:43.730 --> 02:28:46.930]  This is gonna be a chaotic show. There will be some order to this show
[02:28:47.010 --> 02:28:48.130]  I've got three news articles
[02:28:48.130 --> 02:28:51.650]  All we have to do is get through three news articles and then we can have fun guys
[02:28:51.730 --> 02:28:54.530]  Do you want to do one right off the bat while I choke on this giant dab?
[02:28:54.610 --> 02:28:59.410]  Yeah, I just took a big old dad's better than information over coughing. I read commercials and such. Uh,
[02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:04.770]  Yeah, so let's get down to it. Let's uh, I got a click i'm doing the clickety clicks
[02:29:06.210 --> 02:29:10.290]  Sorry for the cough in the mic guys. I am more professional than that definitely has that glue taste
[02:29:10.370 --> 02:29:14.850]  Yeah, that gorilla glue dabs tastes delicious. Hey, mike when you set that down make sure you uh,
[02:29:15.410 --> 02:29:19.650]  Don't cross the street. Yeah, put that right on my cable here so that I can go deaf for another 30 seconds
[02:29:21.810 --> 02:29:23.810]  Shit i've seen weeks
[02:29:23.810 --> 02:29:27.330]  I could tell if he was having a seizure. I wanted to get up and walk away
[02:29:28.770 --> 02:29:32.530]  My body told me get up walk away like just take off your headphones and walk away from that
[02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:37.330]  It's bad. That's how I feel when you're over there like heating it up and scraping the email, you know
[02:29:37.490 --> 02:29:42.610]  You clean the top dude. Yeah, you seem to save that shit for when I come over and it's like oh he loves this shit
[02:29:42.690 --> 02:29:47.330]  What this is this is adam's favorite? I wish I could I don't even want to do it. You don't want to do it here
[02:29:47.330 --> 02:29:51.170]  No, no, no, no everybody and half the people on the planet will have a seizure, right?
[02:29:51.410 --> 02:29:58.690]  All right. I'm gonna read a news article. Um, it says one surprising downside of marijuana legalization major energy use and then there's a picture
[02:29:59.250 --> 02:30:01.410]  Of we got three uh, two five
[02:30:01.570 --> 02:30:04.130]  Not like seven or eight lights hanging in a little grow facility here
[02:30:04.530 --> 02:30:08.690]  With the ballast up on the ceiling just to kind of show you a nice little visual of electricity being ran
[02:30:09.090 --> 02:30:15.170]  And then it says oh this article I better give some credit here who chris mooney from the washington post wrote this
[02:30:15.970 --> 02:30:22.450]  He says across the country there's a growing trend toward the legalization of marijuana four states oregon washington colorado
[02:30:22.670 --> 02:30:29.490]  Alaska have voted to allow people to possess limited amounts of marijuana for personal use and also to let producers apply for licenses to
[02:30:29.490 --> 02:30:31.010]  Produce and sell it
[02:30:31.010 --> 02:30:33.010]  Dc also just voted to allow
[02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:39.570]  Voted to allow personal possession all of this on top of the 23 states that allow it for medical reasons in some states
[02:30:40.210 --> 02:30:44.610]  We just read two different articles that gave me different numbers on that. Didn't we once said 21 said 23?
[02:30:45.490 --> 02:30:48.370]  Well, maybe they were taking it different times. Maybe they're dabbing also
[02:30:50.290 --> 02:30:55.490]  The the way this gets counted up is confusing because there's since uh that second sanjay gupta special
[02:30:55.490 --> 02:30:58.210]  There's been a whole bunch of cbd only states
[02:30:58.930 --> 02:31:03.570]  Across the south pseudo medical how you count that if you count that
[02:31:04.370 --> 02:31:07.330]  Like the numbers a little hey, he was just about 25 now
[02:31:07.490 --> 02:31:11.330]  the guy that was making the big fuss in new jersey was just in the news today wanting to
[02:31:12.050 --> 02:31:14.050]  Go back at it like
[02:31:14.050 --> 02:31:18.850]  Blood money, i'm gonna keep this article going fat and crazy. Yeah, chris christie being all fat and crazy
[02:31:19.090 --> 02:31:21.570]  That's that should be just used to be the governor of florida, too
[02:31:21.570 --> 02:31:23.970]  So I mean like i've there's brother or something
[02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:28.690]  Oh, he's just another man who ain't never gonna be president order in the court in some states where businesses are
[02:31:29.010 --> 02:31:34.850]  Are also now legally cultivating and producing marijuana a mainstream industry is emerging marijuana sales totaled
[02:31:35.070 --> 02:31:38.070]  700 million dollars in colorado last year for instance
[02:31:38.690 --> 02:31:40.690]  Yeah, and how much of that did you spend?
[02:31:41.570 --> 02:31:42.850]  uh
[02:31:43.090 --> 02:31:47.570]  The first three months that I was here. Yeah, I posted a picture on twitter
[02:31:47.650 --> 02:31:51.490]  The only time I bought legal pot last year. It was on january 1st
[02:31:51.570 --> 02:31:55.010]  So I could pull a photo up and get exact 60 bucks. So that was me
[02:31:55.570 --> 02:32:01.970]  Yep, about 125 on the first at the greener side dispensary, but i've bought a lot of this shatter from green and healthy lately
[02:32:02.210 --> 02:32:03.310]  Yeah
[02:32:03.310 --> 02:32:08.210]  2015 is gonna be a different tale, but you said it's a hard thing to let go, you know, right?
[02:32:08.770 --> 02:32:13.890]  I just got all this black cherry chem done. I ran a lot of black cherry chem and it is tasty. It's very tasty
[02:32:13.970 --> 02:32:17.250]  It's a little heavy on the indica side. So for daytime, it's a little bit much sometimes
[02:32:17.810 --> 02:32:19.410]  Can't glob out
[02:32:19.410 --> 02:32:25.170]  All right, uh, but uh, let's see 700 million dollars in colorado last year for instance, but there's a surprising catch
[02:32:25.250 --> 02:32:31.330]  It turns out that indoor marijuana growth in particular a cultivation method often favored in the industry for many reasons usings
[02:32:31.810 --> 02:32:34.210]  Uses a surprising amount of energy
[02:32:34.770 --> 02:32:40.770]  Indeed the level of power use appears to be so significant that one scholar is now suggesting that as the industry grows
[02:32:41.170 --> 02:32:47.010]  States and localities should take advantage of marijuana licensing procedures to also regulate the industry's use
[02:32:47.490 --> 02:32:49.750]  energy use and greenhouse gas emissions
[02:32:50.610 --> 02:32:51.970]  Damn hippie
[02:32:51.970 --> 02:32:58.930]  Given that this new industry, uh, let's see given that this is a new industry that is going to be pretty highly regulated
[02:32:59.010 --> 02:33:03.890]  I felt like the state and local policymakers have a unique opportunity to incorporate energy usage
[02:33:04.050 --> 02:33:11.330]  And climate assessments into their state marijuana licensing fees says gina warren a professor at the texas a&m university school of law
[02:33:11.330 --> 02:33:19.170]  Whose paper titled regulating pot to save the polar bear energy and climate impacts of the marijuana industry will soon appear in the columbia journal
[02:33:19.250 --> 02:33:21.250]  of environmental laws
[02:33:21.810 --> 02:33:23.810]  Wow, that sentence was awesome
[02:33:24.530 --> 02:33:30.290]  Did anybody else catch that? She said pot and polar bears in the same sentence. That's what I got close together
[02:33:30.450 --> 02:33:32.450]  Made some interesting pictures
[02:33:32.930 --> 02:33:36.210]  I just saw a polar bear like running through a field of pot like it was yeah
[02:33:36.370 --> 02:33:39.890]  I just thought that that was like an obstacle of a sentence to get through there were so many
[02:33:41.010 --> 02:33:43.010]  punctuation marks in that
[02:33:43.570 --> 02:33:51.010]  Right now that whole paragraph was one sentence and get it started again. That entire paragraph is one sentence. Let's see. There's a comma
[02:33:52.290 --> 02:33:53.810]  a comma
[02:33:53.810 --> 02:33:57.410]  A comma, so I wrote it a I don't even know what that is an ellipse
[02:33:57.970 --> 02:34:01.890]  And then another comma and then a period yeah, there's so much punctuation that's yeah
[02:34:02.530 --> 02:34:09.730]  Yeah, good writing props the published statistics on energy use from indoor marijuana production will blow your mind whether or not you use this stuff
[02:34:10.130 --> 02:34:16.290]  in a 2012 study of carbon footprint of indoor cannabis production published in the journal energy policy
[02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:23.410]  Researcher evan mills noted that on occasion previous unrecognized spheres of energy used to come to light and marijuana is a textbook example
[02:34:23.730 --> 02:34:30.630]  The study estimated that indoor cannabis both legal and illegal uses six billion dollars worth of electricity
[02:34:30.930 --> 02:34:36.930]  Every year amounting to one percent of overall u.s. Electricity and in some production intensive states like california
[02:34:36.930 --> 02:34:41.090]  It was much higher three percent mills found i haven't read into this article much further
[02:34:41.090 --> 02:34:44.290]  But i'm going to assume that colorado is going to hit like five percent of that birdie
[02:34:44.770 --> 02:34:51.250]  Because we're killing it on the indoor grows. The only thing that would hold colorado back from that would be there is less people here
[02:34:52.210 --> 02:34:57.010]  Than something but we've got texas it's the percentage of our overall usage. Yeah. Yeah. All right
[02:34:57.090 --> 02:35:04.230]  So, uh one average kilogram a final product is associated with four thousand six hundred kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere
[02:35:04.450 --> 02:35:10.130]  Or that of three million average u.s cars when aggregated across all national production road mills
[02:35:10.690 --> 02:35:17.350]  Uh, the reason is simply the technique the technology required specific energy uses include high intensity lighting dehumidification
[02:35:17.670 --> 02:35:26.230]  To remove to remove water vapor and avoid mold formation space heating or cooling during non-illuminated periods and drying preheating of irrigation water
[02:35:26.470 --> 02:35:32.470]  Generation of carbon dioxide by burning fossil fuel and ventilation and air conditioning to remove waste heat rights mills
[02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:40.950]  That's a well researched. They did all that math and they haven't figured out how much carbon dioxide the plants suck back out that air
[02:35:42.390 --> 02:35:45.190]  Not enough there's an well no, but there's another side of that coin
[02:35:45.510 --> 02:35:49.350]  Depends on how many plants you know, I agree with this article fully i'm just saying there's like
[02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:54.470]  There's a there's a little bit of subtraction that needs to be done before we freak out a little true that
[02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:56.870]  Uh, she keeps on going and she says
[02:35:58.550 --> 02:36:01.830]  Oh, where did I go outdoor production also has environmental consequences
[02:36:01.830 --> 02:36:05.510]  It has been charged with deforestation and high levels of water and pesticide use
[02:36:05.830 --> 02:36:11.190]  But as pot becomes more legal and mainstream notes more and outdoor producers will have to abide by pre-existing
[02:36:11.730 --> 02:36:17.030]  Environmental laws just like everyone else in effect that means indoor production the chief climate change
[02:36:18.390 --> 02:36:26.310]  That makes indoor production the chief climate change and energy concern according to warren's article while underground indoor marijuana production already consumed
[02:36:26.470 --> 02:36:32.070]  Plenty of energy legalization will increase energy use even further as the industry grows. So will its negative
[02:36:32.850 --> 02:36:40.470]  Externality she writes which is why she's proposing that all states that legalize marijuana use should also require the growing industry to power itself
[02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:43.910]  Cleanly and it's not without precedent starting in october of this year
[02:36:44.390 --> 02:36:48.630]  Boulder county and colorado will require many facilities to directly offset
[02:36:49.250 --> 02:36:55.190]  100 of electricity propane and natural gas consumption through renewables or other means
[02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:57.750]  That's a fun challenge
[02:36:58.550 --> 02:37:01.030]  That rule now jump on these people wigged out
[02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:02.870]  Yeah
[02:37:02.870 --> 02:37:06.090]  Uh warren says she's not picking on the marijuana industry with her proposals
[02:37:06.490 --> 02:37:07.530]  It's uh, just that well
[02:37:07.530 --> 02:37:12.970]  We don't often have new industries appear that use a lot of energy and are likely to be highly regulated as they become legal
[02:37:13.370 --> 02:37:17.050]  I think it could actually be a marketing tool for the industry says warren
[02:37:17.290 --> 02:37:22.090]  Because if you have people who are purchasing the product who are the type of individual who cares about the environment
[02:37:22.330 --> 02:37:26.110]  Then they would gravitate toward the green marijuana production
[02:37:26.810 --> 02:37:30.410]  What she's saying makes sense because we are sucking up a lot of power and i've thought about it
[02:37:30.490 --> 02:37:34.330]  I don't know how to do it. Maybe somebody can send me an email or something one thing I want to do
[02:37:34.810 --> 02:37:39.370]  Uh, I consider myself a pro grower I could grow you can give me a plant that's half dead and in 90 days
[02:37:39.370 --> 02:37:43.210]  I'll give you some tasty ass buds out of it. I can overcome most problems in a grow room
[02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:49.210]  Now I want some guidance on how to lessen my carbon footprint. I recycle my soil
[02:37:49.850 --> 02:37:54.010]  But still I have to run lights for 12 hours on and 12 hours off. There's no way around it
[02:37:54.010 --> 02:37:56.010]  Are there other things we can do?
[02:37:56.170 --> 02:38:02.810]  To kind of lessen our carbon footprint if you guys know send me ideas. You can tweet them to me. It's a at gfyh podcast
[02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:05.790]  Uh, you can email me it's grow from your heart at hotmail.com
[02:38:08.170 --> 02:38:10.570]  Yeah, well I want to see I want to know how I because there's all kinds of
[02:38:11.530 --> 02:38:13.930]  Argument right now. I mean you would try to find those
[02:38:14.890 --> 02:38:16.150]  cannabis
[02:38:16.150 --> 02:38:19.050]  Cultivators would start looking for places like wine
[02:38:20.330 --> 02:38:24.970]  You know places they would right next to rivers where they can have a water bill
[02:38:25.210 --> 02:38:30.250]  Or i'm just talking about like my pre-existing indoor grow like people that have a home grow or a small warehouse grow
[02:38:30.810 --> 02:38:35.050]  Like I want to find out ways that people like us like you you've got a trap house grow
[02:38:35.290 --> 02:38:37.850]  I want to see a way that you can kind of make a low
[02:38:38.170 --> 02:38:42.890]  Less than your electricity bill just save you however much it is maybe cut 10 of that off. Absolutely
[02:38:42.970 --> 02:38:48.010]  Well, you could definitely do that with solar, you know i'm saying like you're you're just cutting out the hundred dollars that it takes
[02:38:48.010 --> 02:38:49.850]  to run your house would be
[02:38:49.850 --> 02:38:54.970]  a hundred dollars less over a year that would add up, you know, tremendously that's 15 to
[02:38:55.850 --> 02:39:00.170]  You know quite a bit a hundred dollars as much you try to do math right now right now
[02:39:00.250 --> 02:39:02.490]  It's it's 1200 but i'm just saying like, you know
[02:39:03.690 --> 02:39:09.050]  The local application of this is the city of pueblo just required everybody grow indoors. You can't grow outside
[02:39:09.930 --> 02:39:16.010]  In any fashion this year in pueblo. That's kind of silly. Hopefully in a year we'll have greenhouse rules down here
[02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:18.010]  but yeah, they cut it all out and
[02:39:18.970 --> 02:39:21.610]  Not until the very end. No, you're talking about it occurred
[02:39:22.330 --> 02:39:28.330]  No, no, not even not even you can't put your parts outside. No, I six persons in my own backyard. It's illegal
[02:39:29.290 --> 02:39:33.690]  It's a it's a city that's what happens if you're not on the game
[02:39:35.050 --> 02:39:37.050]  Legal the sun is not
[02:39:37.210 --> 02:39:39.210]  They're looking for more illegal pogros here
[02:39:39.770 --> 02:39:44.410]  Now more than they were before we had legalized cannabis to tell you the truth because now they want to regulate the shit out
[02:39:44.410 --> 02:39:49.370]  Of it before they didn't have time now. It's an issue. All right. I want to read which one do we want to do this one?
[02:39:50.090 --> 02:39:54.090]  Uh, do you want to do the which one the good one? Well, they're both good brother
[02:39:55.050 --> 02:39:58.010]  No, just fucking with you do you want to read the one written by
[02:39:59.130 --> 02:40:01.610]  They're both written by the same person sweet. We'll do that
[02:40:02.890 --> 02:40:06.570]  No, kristen wyatt actually is writing a lot. Do you want to do the one about racism?
[02:40:06.970 --> 02:40:10.570]  Uh and drop in colorado. I fucking love that. All right, let's read this one
[02:40:11.770 --> 02:40:14.970]  What happens when you legalize pot? This is one of the this is from the cannabis
[02:40:14.970 --> 02:40:17.770]  It's written by kristen wyatt of the associated pretty alaska
[02:40:17.850 --> 02:40:22.890]  It says the legalization of marijuana in colorado hasn't solved the racial disparities in enforcement that drug policy
[02:40:22.890 --> 02:40:28.010]  Reformers had hoped to end with blacks still far more likely than whites to be charged with pot related crimes
[02:40:28.010 --> 02:40:33.370]  A new report says the report issued wednesday by the pro-legalization drug policy alliance showed
[02:40:33.770 --> 02:40:40.170]  That marijuana arrests in colorado all but stopped after voters made the drug legal in small amounts for those 21 and older
[02:40:40.410 --> 02:40:46.170]  But the report noted continuing racial disparities involving the marijuana crimes that remain including public use and
[02:40:46.730 --> 02:40:49.050]  possession in excess of the ounce limit
[02:40:49.530 --> 02:40:56.030]  Study the study examined drug arrests in all 64 colorado counties for two years before and after legalization in 2012
[02:40:56.730 --> 02:41:02.090]  the total number of charges for pot possession distribution and cultivation plummeted by almost 95
[02:41:02.810 --> 02:41:03.990]  from about
[02:41:03.990 --> 02:41:08.250]  39 000 in 2010 to just over 2000 last year. That's
[02:41:08.970 --> 02:41:11.770]  If it only takes an hour of the cop's time
[02:41:12.810 --> 02:41:14.810]  That's 37 cop hours
[02:41:14.950 --> 02:41:21.210]  37 000 37 000 cop hours. We just reallocated to shit. That's worth something useful
[02:41:21.290 --> 02:41:25.450]  Yeah, they can be out solving a crime any crime looking for your bike that got stolen. Yep
[02:41:25.530 --> 02:41:28.570]  Looking for something that bad happened. I don't even want to create crimes in my head
[02:41:28.650 --> 02:41:33.450]  I have to say it has been nice like not worrying about the bag that's in my pocket. Yeah
[02:41:33.930 --> 02:41:39.630]  Yeah, it's beautiful, isn't it? It honestly is you know, it's the only crime most marijuana consumers
[02:41:40.270 --> 02:41:44.750]  The only law other than like traffic and fractions I wear my seatbelt don't speed like
[02:41:45.470 --> 02:41:49.550]  It's literally the only problem is once you pull me over. It's like here's the bag
[02:41:51.310 --> 02:41:54.350]  Smells like weed in there. Sure. Yes, sir. Just came from the dispensary, right?
[02:41:54.670 --> 02:41:57.310]  Like yeah, I hope it smells good in here. I paid a lot of money for that here
[02:41:57.390 --> 02:42:01.550]  You can have my sweater give me five minutes and then when you come back tell me it smells like weed in here
[02:42:01.630 --> 02:42:02.270]  Yeah, all right
[02:42:02.270 --> 02:42:07.150]  So i'm gonna keep reading because we want to get through a couple articles even after legalization blacks were more likely twice as likely
[02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:10.910]  Oh, sorry, I read that wrong blacks were more than I've I've stuttered because
[02:42:12.590 --> 02:42:15.870]  We're saying blacks still is that right american would be the correct term
[02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:18.910]  It was a little harsh when I read it, too
[02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:22.670]  I'm, not a member of the pc squad. I didn't write this article
[02:42:22.750 --> 02:42:27.470]  So if you want to complain that we're calling african-american people doing it, that's yeah
[02:42:27.790 --> 02:42:30.910]  That's when you know, you've made it when you got those one or two guys that are like
[02:42:32.430 --> 02:42:35.230]  You can send an email to kristin white at the associated press
[02:42:36.030 --> 02:42:40.030]  She did that not me I found it slightly off-putting to tell you the truth
[02:42:40.590 --> 02:42:46.850]  Um, even after legalization african-american folks were more than twice as likely as whites and whites
[02:42:51.470 --> 02:42:52.590]  Man
[02:42:52.590 --> 02:42:59.230]  This is oddly written. You tell us community. Is it us or in the dabs or is it how it's written?
[02:42:59.630 --> 02:43:02.270]  Is this are we the racist one or are they
[02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:08.590]  Blacks were also more much more likely to be charged with illegal cultivation of pot or possession of more than an ounce
[02:43:09.450 --> 02:43:10.830]  legalization that
[02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:12.830]  i'm still
[02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:17.390]  We legalized pot we didn't legalize decent policing
[02:43:17.930 --> 02:43:24.830]  Legalization is no panacea for the long-time issues that law enforcement had with the black and brown community said art way colorado director for the drug
[02:43:24.910 --> 02:43:26.430]  policy alliance
[02:43:26.430 --> 02:43:31.630]  Still the drop-off and overall arrest is good news for minorities said tony newman also of the drug policy alliance
[02:43:32.110 --> 02:43:33.950]  despite the uprising
[02:43:33.950 --> 02:43:39.470]  Racial disparities the massive drops and arrests have been enormously beneficial to people of color newman said
[02:43:40.270 --> 02:43:42.430]  Is this is this racist?
[02:43:42.830 --> 02:43:50.030]  The more I think about it the more I think we stopped referring to people by the general shade of their skin like fucking 20 years
[02:43:50.590 --> 02:43:52.830]  You know the term that I related to in there
[02:43:53.310 --> 02:44:00.350]  I can't think of it now. I just based on it. Uh already past. Yeah. Yeah, it was the people of minority minority
[02:44:00.430 --> 02:44:06.670]  Oh, you're the minorities. Well, all right. The analysis did not break out data for colorado's largest ethnic minority latinos
[02:44:06.910 --> 02:44:12.530]  That's because data comes from the national incident-based reporting system system, which does not tally numbers for latinos
[02:44:13.150 --> 02:44:21.550]  One of the region's top officials for coordinating drug enforcement. Todd gorman of the rocky mountain high intensity drug trafficking area program insisted that officers are not
[02:44:21.950 --> 02:44:27.710]  Racially profiling pot users. No, they're not they're just calling them blacks and whites. That's all they're doing. It's not a profile
[02:44:27.790 --> 02:44:30.190]  It's a general assumption about a whole race of people
[02:44:34.030 --> 02:44:37.790]  What does it mean that i'm just racist about that rape laws weapon laws are racist
[02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:40.430]  There are other factors going on here that we need to address
[02:44:41.070 --> 02:44:44.590]  We don't tell us we gotta stop fucking with the dark people, too
[02:44:44.910 --> 02:44:53.310]  After legalization racial disparities did ease somewhat for marijuana distribution charges blacks accounted for about 22 percent of such arrests in 2010 and around
[02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:59.090]  18 in 2014 the arrest data got a mixed response from the regional head of the naacp
[02:44:59.870 --> 02:45:03.790]  Did the head of the naacp know that you were calling them blacks when you wrote this article?
[02:45:05.630 --> 02:45:13.570]  The overall decrease in arrest charges and cases is enormously beneficial to communities of color who bore the brunt of marijuana prohibition
[02:45:14.130 --> 02:45:16.370]  Rosemary harris little said in a statement
[02:45:16.450 --> 02:45:23.490]  However, we are concerned with the rise in a disparity for the charge of public consumption and challenge law enforcement to ensure
[02:45:23.490 --> 02:45:28.930]  This reality is not a discriminatory in any manner. Wow. That was hard to read
[02:45:29.410 --> 02:45:34.050]  In 2014 the years the the year colorado's recreational marijuana stores opened
[02:45:34.610 --> 02:45:42.230]  Blacks were 3.9 of the population but accounted for 9.2 of pot possession arrests for illegal marijuana cultivation
[02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:48.070]  Disparities didn't just persist they got much worse in 2010 whites in colorado
[02:45:48.150 --> 02:45:54.730]  Were slightly more likely than blacks to be arrested for growing pot after legalization the arrest rate for whites dropped dramatically
[02:45:55.270 --> 02:46:01.350]  But ticked up for blacks in 2014. The arrest rate for blacks was roughly 2.5 times higher
[02:46:01.830 --> 02:46:03.830]  There's a lot more of this article, but i'm not going to read it
[02:46:04.790 --> 02:46:06.790]  It's almost done, but we get the point
[02:46:07.350 --> 02:46:08.150]  uh
[02:46:08.230 --> 02:46:11.350]  I don't like the way it's written and I just want to abandon it to tell you the truth
[02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:13.670]  I'm tired. It's got a lot of really good information in it
[02:46:13.670 --> 02:46:19.050]  But it seems like it was written really really fast by somebody who wasn't really thinking meet that deadline in the 60s
[02:46:19.590 --> 02:46:21.590]  Like well, they still call people
[02:46:21.990 --> 02:46:26.870]  I really like that reporter. Um, but yeah, this strikes me as a little bit odd. How are you mike?
[02:46:27.030 --> 02:46:31.510]  Tell me do you just like all of his workers? It's just a chick. No, it's a chick. It's a lady. It's a female
[02:46:31.510 --> 02:46:33.430]  I'm, sorry. I didn't mean to call her chick. That's rude, but she's a lady
[02:46:33.430 --> 02:46:35.750]  She's got a reporter assigned to the colorado marijuana
[02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:39.990]  I'm gonna take a drink of this water and then we're gonna read another article written by the same person and we're gonna try to
[02:46:40.550 --> 02:46:42.550]  Avenger is this racist?
[02:46:44.870 --> 02:46:48.230]  I don't know that felt really weird like I don't like and blacks
[02:46:49.270 --> 02:46:52.950]  It just sounds so fucking rude to me. It did see like something like if we were in
[02:46:53.430 --> 02:46:57.190]  In public you wouldn't want to say it full throat. I was just gonna ask you in the back
[02:46:57.350 --> 02:46:59.590]  I was just gonna ask you would you say that out loud at the mall?
[02:46:59.910 --> 02:47:05.430]  Like probably not but she's looking at all these black stated very that's how she would state it in
[02:47:05.830 --> 02:47:08.950]  A courtroom, you know, I mean or politics there, but they're
[02:47:09.750 --> 02:47:11.750]  I mean, let's just be real though
[02:47:11.910 --> 02:47:15.510]  I'm, no civil rights person, but I don't I don't even want to be called the whites over here
[02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:18.470]  I'm not the whites and they're not the blacks. That's I mean
[02:47:20.710 --> 02:47:25.270]  I chose minority because I got long hair and that means you get pulled but you're still a person like
[02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:31.430]  And that's what that's why I was trying to hit that moral of the story is pot's almost legal if you're white here
[02:47:31.670 --> 02:47:38.630]  It's kind of legally for black yeah, but crime the arrests are down a lot, uh, but it's still high for black people stay off
[02:47:38.790 --> 02:47:41.590]  Facebook i'm sitting there doing the math in my head. That's roughly
[02:47:42.610 --> 02:47:44.230]  22,000
[02:47:44.230 --> 02:47:47.670]  People of color that didn't get arrested or fucked with last year
[02:47:48.870 --> 02:47:52.730]  But still the data is so screwed up like we really need to restructure
[02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:56.310]  Most of how we enforce the laws in this country guys
[02:47:56.310 --> 02:48:00.070]  I want your opinion on that article the people that are listening tweet me email me. You know how to do it
[02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:02.070]  I said it earlier. I want your opinion tweet
[02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:05.110]  Go read it. I mean if it's not a racist article
[02:48:05.190 --> 02:48:10.710]  Was it oddly written in a racist tone? Like I didn't like the way that is it racist to say it that way?
[02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:13.350]  I didn't like it. All right. Yeah, I didn't like it
[02:48:13.350 --> 02:48:19.110]  So I abandoned and we're gonna read another article this one the controversy says colorado bill seeks to standardize marijuana testing
[02:48:20.230 --> 02:48:22.230]  Um, what i've noticed is a lot of people
[02:48:22.790 --> 02:48:27.990]  Uh in colorado don't trust the testing facilities anymore because we'll take a test to one lab and it'll come out at 22
[02:48:28.310 --> 02:48:30.870]  You can take another test to another lab and it'll come out at 29
[02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:36.150]  And of course everyone's going to start going to the lab that gets higher tests because you want to be able to brag about higher
[02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:37.110]  results
[02:48:37.110 --> 02:48:38.550]  so
[02:48:38.550 --> 02:48:39.910]  It's there's no
[02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:44.790]  Real standard for the testing labs. We can all just open our own lab pretty much and be like I got the testing lab
[02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:47.270]  It's just an email or a printed piece of paper
[02:48:47.430 --> 02:48:53.190]  Yeah, that's all you get you get a pdf and then you have to worry about if those high dollar people couldn't pay more for better
[02:48:53.270 --> 02:48:54.790]  testing results so
[02:48:54.950 --> 02:49:00.710]  Colorado is moving to establish another marijuana first the first government standards for marijuana testing a bill approved
[02:49:00.950 --> 02:49:07.990]  By its first committee in the state legislature on thursday would create a statewide laboratory standard for the state's 18 pot testing labs
[02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:16.470]  Currently, the labs are certified by the state health authorities, but they don't have uniform rules for testing pot potency homogeneity and contaminants as required by state law
[02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:21.670]  Lab owners say they need the standards because different labs now produce very different results
[02:49:22.070 --> 02:49:27.510]  Existing pot tests generally just look for whether the drug whether the drug is present not how strong it is
[02:49:27.990 --> 02:49:30.330]  In most industries, there are long established
[02:49:31.030 --> 02:49:35.930]  Long established processes said ian berenger owner of a pot testing lab called rm3
[02:49:36.470 --> 02:49:42.150]  However for cannabis like most of the industry. We're making up the rules as we go along. I'm glad he admits that
[02:49:42.790 --> 02:49:45.270]  The labs can currently be used. Oh, where did I click? There we go
[02:49:45.350 --> 02:49:48.390]  The labs can currently be used by licensed marijuana producers
[02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:56.250]  The bill was amended to remove lab access to private individuals and industrial hemp growers now covered in separate bills still pending in the legislature
[02:49:56.790 --> 02:50:02.470]  Which kind of bars me from getting my cannabis tested now, uh the stuff that I used to grow up my private grow for my patients
[02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:05.750]  I was able to take that to the lab and get it tested and we could see what was in there
[02:50:06.150 --> 02:50:10.150]  And I think we all need access to that. I don't understand why they cut us off. This is not only that
[02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:14.870]  This is the latest step in a dance that's been going on for 10 years
[02:50:15.350 --> 02:50:21.030]  Like I remember we didn't have testing labs because the existing labs that had the equipment and the know-how
[02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:25.750]  Are banned from working with cannabis because they all require fda and federal licensing
[02:50:25.910 --> 02:50:29.830]  Yeah, so we had to build these from the ground up. I didn't know there were 18 of them in the state
[02:50:29.830 --> 02:50:31.670]  That's pretty cool. Yeah
[02:50:31.670 --> 02:50:36.790]  So it says a separate bill advanced thursday in a senate committee would allow industrial hemp growers to use the labs, too
[02:50:37.190 --> 02:50:41.190]  Colorado currently allows farmers to grow hemp marijuana's non-intoxicating cousin
[02:50:41.430 --> 02:50:47.430]  But only if the plants fall below a threshold for the plants intoxicating ingredient thc it's not an ingredient
[02:50:48.310 --> 02:50:52.630]  However, the farmers can take their plants to a lab to make sure they're meeting the standard
[02:50:53.190 --> 02:50:58.150]  The testing bill creates what's called a reference library a standard set of protocols for testing pot
[02:50:58.710 --> 02:51:04.630]  The lab owner said the state needs to essentially referee all the methodologies that we're using
[02:51:05.110 --> 02:51:07.750]  We all understand the need to reveal the special sauce
[02:51:07.750 --> 02:51:15.190]  We've been using to further the industry berenger said the bill now heads to a separate committee before consideration by the full house
[02:51:15.750 --> 02:51:17.750]  Full house. I used to watch that. Uh
[02:51:18.710 --> 02:51:21.910]  I agree this needs to happen, dude. We need to no, this is huge
[02:51:21.990 --> 02:51:28.650]  It's one of the beautiful parts of legalization is it's it's like everything else. These guys are the regulators. They need to be regulated
[02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:32.070]  Of all people the testing labs for sure need to know what they're doing
[02:51:32.950 --> 02:51:35.510]  Using the same equipment planned by the same rules we're gonna
[02:51:35.990 --> 02:51:41.350]  Start seeing reality in our testing like you can spot bullshit on the shelf if you're us
[02:51:42.150 --> 02:51:48.790]  Like I know your flower doesn't have 40 thc to do. Yeah. Yeah. How are you gonna even you clearly keep the
[02:51:50.790 --> 02:51:56.950]  There's a local shop that claims they have a 30 strain and i've seen it and it's mids it is not 30
[02:51:57.830 --> 02:52:00.390]  It's definitely not. Yeah. Yeah, I know about the national
[02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:05.350]  Do you remember the guy that was all hyped up about his 29?
[02:52:06.390 --> 02:52:07.190]  Yeah
[02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:11.110]  Apple pie wasn't that I don't yeah, I think so. Yeah, the apple pie strain
[02:52:11.590 --> 02:52:13.990]  And we we both took one look at it. We both look at him
[02:52:13.990 --> 02:52:16.710]  We both looked at us and it was like we tried not to giggle
[02:52:17.430 --> 02:52:23.670]  Like yeah, we all saw each other's poker face right then definitely. Yeah, it was mids. Everyone knows when you shit the bed and
[02:52:24.470 --> 02:52:27.910]  You can spot it on this the rough trade to have just saying like
[02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:33.750]  But now with with these testing labs if we get them all standardized and regulated then we won't have to worry like
[02:52:34.150 --> 02:52:37.830]  If you're like this hash was tested super clean and super high in potency
[02:52:38.150 --> 02:52:39.590]  I'm, like well, where'd you get it done?
[02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:43.670]  Did you get it at the place that you pay a lot more and they just give you really high results of the mall?
[02:52:43.990 --> 02:52:45.110]  Yeah, or did you go to the place?
[02:52:45.110 --> 02:52:49.590]  It's reputable and like if you got to test it steep hill I trust you but I don't know any of the other places
[02:52:49.670 --> 02:52:53.270]  Steeply gave me a tour of their facility and showed me what's going on
[02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:58.550]  They blew my mind all the other places you just give them a sample and they drive away and send you an email later
[02:52:58.790 --> 02:53:03.670]  They're not they're they're 100 cannabis, too. Correct? Or yeah, that's all they test, right?
[02:53:04.230 --> 02:53:10.790]  Edibles and your right. Well, i'm just saying they're not another laboratory like oh, yeah, we got we got science stuff in here
[02:53:11.270 --> 02:53:13.270]  Science bitch will do that too
[02:53:13.270 --> 02:53:17.670]  More and more important because we just required that all edible dosing be pretty much perfect
[02:53:17.910 --> 02:53:22.390]  Yeah, and you guys remember how that first regulatory check went through?
[02:53:22.790 --> 02:53:27.350]  Yeah, that was like episode six. I think that was a long time ago. We talked about that. Yeah, there were edibles
[02:53:28.230 --> 02:53:32.630]  They had 100 milligrams of thc and they had zero edipure. What's going on? Yeah
[02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:37.270]  Why kick a man for some fuck up last year? But yeah, they're uh,
[02:53:37.830 --> 02:53:40.390]  There were a whole bunch of companies that couldn't make it and then we had new
[02:53:40.950 --> 02:53:44.550]  rules that required that only 10 milligrams of thc are in each
[02:53:45.590 --> 02:53:51.190]  Easily identifiable segment which meant no more 450 milligram fun size snickers
[02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:52.950]  Wow
[02:53:52.950 --> 02:53:56.470]  Rocky mountain medicine bar. Oh those things are so delicious
[02:53:56.470 --> 02:54:00.070]  Somebody showed me one the other day maddie pulled one out of the fridge and she's like have you had these?
[02:54:00.390 --> 02:54:06.710]  It's uh, the mountain medicine peanut butter bars 350 milligrams. I was like, dude, I ate one on the podcast and almost floated out of the chair
[02:54:07.590 --> 02:54:12.070]  It was a fun night speaking of which um, I want I want this 1200 milligram challenge
[02:54:12.710 --> 02:54:15.590]  Like the 2500 milligram. No, no, no, no, no, no
[02:54:16.470 --> 02:54:18.470]  No, no, if you're gonna do it, you're gonna do it
[02:54:18.710 --> 02:54:21.750]  Half marathon if you want me to ralphie man, let's do it then I mean
[02:54:23.030 --> 02:54:28.310]  I mean if that's the kind of night you really want if you guys don't know about the 2500 milligram challenge
[02:54:30.870 --> 02:54:32.870]  You gotta work up to it you don't just want to drop down
[02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:40.710]  No, yeah, I love how they put it on the that last episode like shit didn't really get done for a month, but it happened
[02:54:41.510 --> 02:54:45.110]  We all live but like we're still paying it off. Yeah. Yeah
[02:54:45.190 --> 02:54:47.350]  So it's something you got to work up to and I don't know if you want to do it
[02:54:47.510 --> 02:54:49.510]  Guys, we're gonna wrap up the show. We did the news articles

[02:58:03.850 --> 02:58:05.850]  She deserves this trip quite a bit
[02:58:05.930 --> 02:58:09.770]  Only like 30 kids in the whole nation were qualified to go on this
[02:58:11.930 --> 02:58:15.850]  For real, uh, i'm obviously well my phone just reset and I have a note on there
[02:58:15.850 --> 02:58:18.730]  I was gonna read at the end of the show and there goes that idea. No, you don't
[02:58:19.690 --> 02:58:20.970]  Womp womp
[02:58:20.970 --> 02:58:23.450]  But uh, yeah, so that's where the funding is going. It's going to my kiddo
[02:58:23.530 --> 02:58:27.690]  I'm trying to get her to hawaii. It's gonna cost like four or five thousand bucks for this trip
[02:58:28.410 --> 02:58:33.210]  And uh, yeah, i read genetics is a small, uh business and I can't just pull that out of my ass to tell you the truth
[02:58:33.770 --> 02:58:38.730]  There are other things that require they're required like a plane ticket also. So yeah, it's just like the the class itself
[02:58:38.810 --> 02:58:43.850]  Yeah, you can't drive to hawaii. Yeah, that'd be fun. Maybe uh, if you have ever driven to hawaii
[02:58:45.450 --> 02:58:47.450]  We want you on the show. Yeah
[02:58:47.690 --> 02:58:53.050]  All right, but anyway hit that paypal account, um, that's gonna we'll have to find another worthy cause for that
