[00:11.320 --> 00:20.240]  Yeah, welcome back, cannabis community.
[00:20.240 --> 00:24.760]  It's time for episode number 85 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast, your source for cannabis
[00:24.760 --> 00:25.760]  news, education, and conversation.
[00:25.760 --> 00:30.520]  That's right, if you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower, if you're a new smoker
[00:30.520 --> 00:33.920]  or a veteran dabber, if you're a cannabis activist, or if you're someone who's just
[00:33.920 --> 00:38.040]  curious about the current state of cannabis, this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:38.040 --> 00:39.960]  I'm your host, they call me Rost and Jeff.
[00:39.960 --> 00:41.000]  Thanks again for joining me.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.720]  As always, I need to send a huge thank you shout out to the Mystic Roots Band for letting
[00:44.720 --> 00:46.040]  me use their music on the show.
[00:46.040 --> 00:50.320]  Big thanks to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:50.320 --> 00:51.320]  What's up, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:51.320 --> 00:52.520]  I hope everyone's having a great day.
[00:52.520 --> 00:56.640]  We're coming to you, it's about 7.10 PM, so everyone's sitting here taking some fat dabs
[00:56.640 --> 00:57.840]  at the table.
[00:57.840 --> 01:02.800]  Let me introduce to you our super photography expert, our dab master.
[01:02.800 --> 01:04.200]  I'm just making shit up now.
[01:04.200 --> 01:07.160]  This is our cannabis photography guide for the day.
[01:07.160 --> 01:08.480]  This is my good buddy, Joe, to my left.
[01:08.480 --> 01:09.480]  How you doing, brother?
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.480]  Welcome to the show.
[01:10.480 --> 01:11.720]  Oh, thank you for having me.
[01:11.720 --> 01:13.040]  I am grateful to be here.
[01:13.040 --> 01:14.360]  Oh, man, it's great having you.
[01:15.000 --> 01:16.000]  Thanks for coming to the...
[01:16.000 --> 01:17.000]  The studio doesn't have a name.
[01:17.000 --> 01:18.440]  We'll have to make up a name for this very soon.
[01:18.440 --> 01:19.760]  Thanks for coming to my dining room.
[01:19.760 --> 01:22.120]  Yes, the iReed dining room.
[01:22.120 --> 01:23.120]  There we go, the iReed table.
[01:23.120 --> 01:24.120]  I was going to...
[01:24.120 --> 01:27.040]  I wanted to call it Sticky Knob Studios a long time ago, and somebody told me that that
[01:27.040 --> 01:28.040]  just sounds disgusting.
[01:28.040 --> 01:32.760]  Well, it's because there's hash all over everything now after taking so many dabs.
[01:32.760 --> 01:35.760]  But ladies and gentlemen, directly in front of me, also here joining us on microphone,
[01:35.760 --> 01:36.760]  is my good buddy, Sloppy.
[01:36.760 --> 01:37.760]  How you doing, brother?
[01:37.760 --> 01:38.760]  Doing well, doing well.
[01:38.760 --> 01:39.840]  Glad to be here.
[01:39.840 --> 01:40.840]  Really high, that's nice.
[01:40.840 --> 01:42.080]  Yeah, we're all a little bit high.
[01:42.080 --> 01:46.480]  So there may be some giggles here in this podcast, but it's going to be fun.
[01:46.480 --> 01:50.280]  Well, since we're talking about dabs, this is a good time to give a big shout out to
[01:50.280 --> 01:53.120]  our friend Bobo Blaster Co.
[01:53.120 --> 01:56.240]  This guy calls himself Bobo Blaster Co. on Instagram.
[01:56.240 --> 01:57.240]  He's got a website.
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.240]  It is...
[01:58.240 --> 01:59.240]  Hashtag Burniture.
[01:59.240 --> 02:00.240]  There you go.
[02:00.240 --> 02:02.000]  It's burniture.bigcartel.com.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.040]  You can check it out.
[02:03.040 --> 02:06.700]  This dude makes furniture with an email attached to it, bro.
[02:06.700 --> 02:07.700]  There's nothing cooler.
[02:07.700 --> 02:08.760]  There's nothing better.
[02:08.760 --> 02:12.440]  You can sit at a coffee table and Slop and I were sitting at the coffee table taking
[02:12.440 --> 02:13.800]  dabs just chatting.
[02:13.800 --> 02:14.880]  It was kind of amazing.
[02:14.880 --> 02:15.880]  It was lovely.
[02:15.880 --> 02:16.880]  Isn't it beautiful?
[02:16.880 --> 02:17.880]  Yeah, it was great.
[02:17.880 --> 02:18.880]  And it's nice.
[02:18.880 --> 02:20.040]  It's beautiful over there.
[02:20.040 --> 02:21.040]  It's gorgeous.
[02:21.040 --> 02:22.040]  It is a sexy table.
[02:22.040 --> 02:23.560]  Dude, I really appreciate you sending me that.
[02:23.560 --> 02:30.440]  I recommend that everybody else checks out burniture.bigcartel.com and follow him on
[02:30.440 --> 02:31.560]  Facebook or on Instagram.
[02:31.560 --> 02:33.000]  It's Bobo Blaster Co.
[02:33.000 --> 02:35.200]  B-O-B-O Blaster Co.
[02:35.200 --> 02:37.160]  Yes, sir.
[02:38.160 --> 02:40.000]  Very creative Instagram handle.
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.960]  When I meet him this week, I'm going to ask him what he got that from.
[02:43.960 --> 02:44.960]  Let's see.
[02:44.960 --> 02:47.240]  Before we get too far and get too dabbed out, this podcast is brought to you by our good
[02:47.240 --> 02:49.280]  friends at Hygro Indoor Growing Supplies.

[03:39.400 --> 03:40.600]  Let's get down to business.
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.360]  I invited my good buddy Joe over because we want to learn a little bit about cannabis
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.360]  photography.
[03:46.360 --> 03:47.880]  Joe, I got to give you a compliment.
[03:47.880 --> 03:50.080]  You take really great cannabis pictures.
[03:50.080 --> 03:51.360]  Well, thank you very much.
[03:51.360 --> 03:52.360]  I appreciate that.
[03:52.360 --> 03:53.360]  Very, very much.
[03:53.360 --> 03:55.040]  And you called me an expert before.
[03:55.040 --> 03:56.400]  I am no expert.
[03:56.400 --> 04:00.480]  I'm just an enthusiast who has had a camera for a while.
[04:00.480 --> 04:01.600]  I like that.
[04:01.600 --> 04:02.600]  I like the modesty there.
[04:03.520 --> 04:04.520]  I appreciate that.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.800]  I definitely like being corrected on the show.
[04:06.800 --> 04:09.280]  He's our enthusiast with a lot of experience here.
[04:09.280 --> 04:10.280]  That's what we'll call him.
[04:10.280 --> 04:11.280]  Not an expert.
[04:11.280 --> 04:13.120]  Take everything he has with a grain of salt, you guys.
[04:13.120 --> 04:14.120]  I'm just kidding.
[04:14.120 --> 04:15.120]  No, I really do.
[04:15.120 --> 04:17.040]  I trust you and respect your opinion.
[04:17.040 --> 04:18.040]  That's why I brought you here.
[04:18.040 --> 04:19.040]  Slop's here.
[04:19.040 --> 04:20.040]  He's going to chime in once in a while.
[04:20.040 --> 04:22.320]  Then, we're going to do this episode.
[04:22.320 --> 04:24.120]  Then, we're going to have another fat dab session.
[04:24.120 --> 04:28.160]  Then, we're going to record an episode featuring our good buddy Slop over here.
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.800]  Let's jump into the photography with our good buddy who is almost an expert in my opinion,
[04:32.800 --> 04:33.800]  Joe.
[04:33.800 --> 04:36.720]  What we want to do is improve the listener's photography.
[04:36.720 --> 04:37.720]  Did I just say that?
[04:37.720 --> 04:38.720]  Yeah.
[04:38.720 --> 04:41.280]  Anyway, what we want to do is improve their photography.
[04:41.280 --> 04:46.040]  The main thing that I'll start with is what you guys need to do is think about why are
[04:46.040 --> 04:47.360]  you shooting photography?
[04:47.360 --> 04:48.560]  What's your point?
[04:48.560 --> 04:50.520]  Are you going to do it for advertising?
[04:50.520 --> 04:52.400]  Are you going to do it for magazine shots?
[04:52.400 --> 04:56.760]  Or are you simply just trying to be cool on social media and get a lot of followers?
[04:56.840 --> 05:01.080]  That's going to make a huge difference in a lot of the equipment that you need to purchase.
[05:01.080 --> 05:02.960]  That's pretty much what I came up with.
[05:02.960 --> 05:07.160]  Then, I wanted to ask Joe if he could elaborate on that.
[05:07.160 --> 05:14.120]  Then, also if he could help us select a camera for our purpose and possibly that fits our budget.
[05:14.120 --> 05:15.320]  Does that make any sense to you, bro?
[05:15.320 --> 05:16.320]  Yeah, most certainly.
[05:16.320 --> 05:17.320]  Awesome.
[05:17.320 --> 05:20.320]  If you're doing the social media thing, stick with your phone.
[05:20.320 --> 05:22.360]  Your phone is an amazing device.
[05:22.360 --> 05:25.440]  Nine megapixels, 10 megapixels, even more in some.
[05:25.440 --> 05:26.440]  That's ridiculous.
[05:26.480 --> 05:30.720]  As long as you have the proper lighting, that phone will do everything that you need.
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.480]  For the point and shoot, if you're a blogger, somebody who's taking pictures of food or
[05:34.480 --> 05:39.320]  friends, little videos here and there, even if you're filming YouTube videos, point and
[05:39.320 --> 05:40.320]  shoot.
[05:40.320 --> 05:46.560]  You can get a point and shoot $200 to $500, $600 if you want to really go crazy on them.
[05:46.560 --> 05:52.680]  You can get an amazing blog-worthy, internet-worthy camera, all the capabilities that you need.
[05:52.920 --> 05:57.800]  Then, if you like you said, advertising and really, really want nice pictures, you can
[05:57.800 --> 05:59.280]  put them on blogs too.
[05:59.280 --> 06:00.520]  Certainly no limits.
[06:00.520 --> 06:06.480]  If you must have the camera quality, the top camera quality in all aspects, that's definitely
[06:06.480 --> 06:10.440]  the DSLR, a digital single lens reflex camera.
[06:10.440 --> 06:11.440]  Nice.
[06:11.440 --> 06:13.440]  Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[06:13.440 --> 06:16.600]  You guys, there will not be a test, so you don't have to try to remember that.
[06:16.600 --> 06:17.600]  Yes.
[06:17.600 --> 06:18.600]  All right.
[06:18.600 --> 06:20.880]  I don't really know what it means, but I know that that's what it stands for.
[06:20.880 --> 06:21.880]  You know the acronym?
[06:22.080 --> 06:24.080]  I'm glad I didn't ask.
[06:24.080 --> 06:26.480]  So, Joe proved the point right there.
[06:26.480 --> 06:28.200]  Just think about what you're shooting for.
[06:28.200 --> 06:30.800]  If you're just trying to be on Instagram, if you're going blogging, you don't need to
[06:30.800 --> 06:33.040]  spend a million dollars on all of your equipment.
[06:33.040 --> 06:35.640]  If you're just trying to shoot some Instagram pictures, if you're trying to be a Twitter
[06:35.640 --> 06:38.080]  guy, if you're doing Facebook, you can use your phone.
[06:38.080 --> 06:42.840]  All of the new iPhones, the Samsung phones, my iPhone 6 takes amazing pictures.
[06:42.840 --> 06:45.640]  All the new phones, you can get really quality pictures.
[06:45.640 --> 06:47.320]  He said lighting.
[06:47.320 --> 06:50.080]  We'll get into lighting in just a minute.
[06:50.080 --> 06:51.080]  If you guys want to be...
[06:51.080 --> 06:55.200]  You know, I've had a magazine shot and I did not use a super expensive camera.
[06:55.200 --> 06:56.840]  I used a $200 camera for that.
[06:56.840 --> 06:58.080]  So it's not all about the camera.
[06:58.080 --> 06:59.600]  A lot of it is about the settings.
[06:59.600 --> 07:01.080]  A lot of it is about the lighting.
[07:01.080 --> 07:05.280]  A lot of it is about learning where to shoot from and maybe a little bit of editing, but
[07:05.280 --> 07:06.880]  we'll get into that more.
[07:06.880 --> 07:08.680]  So select a camera that fits your budget.
[07:08.680 --> 07:10.560]  Get the best camera you can for your budget.
[07:10.560 --> 07:13.160]  When I first bought my camera, I was intimidated.
[07:13.160 --> 07:16.480]  I bought a point and shoot camera and I feel like I almost...
[07:16.480 --> 07:21.800]  I didn't waste the $200, but if I would have put that money toward my nice DSLR camera
[07:21.800 --> 07:24.760]  in the beginning, I would be further in shooting.
[07:24.760 --> 07:27.080]  Don't be intimidated by a camera with a lot of settings.
[07:27.080 --> 07:31.080]  Most of the new DSLRs, I think all of them, have an auto setting.
[07:31.080 --> 07:34.040]  And so you can learn through that auto setting.
[07:34.040 --> 07:37.920]  Most all new cameras are extremely user-friendly.
[07:37.920 --> 07:40.040]  Manufacturers know who they're making cameras for.
[07:40.040 --> 07:42.720]  They know what their audience is.
[07:42.720 --> 07:44.240]  Even if you've never used...
[07:44.240 --> 07:48.400]  As long as you're technology capable, as long as you...
[07:48.400 --> 07:53.080]  Yeah, be technology capable, buy any camera you want, and you will be able to figure it
[07:53.080 --> 07:56.920]  out if it's not on your own through experimenting, YouTube.
[07:56.920 --> 07:58.200]  YouTube, definitely.
[07:58.200 --> 08:00.120]  Yeah, YouTube is always a good resource.
[08:00.120 --> 08:04.920]  Just type in this camera and then the question you have about it and it will pop up 17 videos
[08:04.920 --> 08:08.240]  and watch a couple of them and filter out the bullshit because every one of those guys
[08:08.240 --> 08:10.560]  is going to tell you some weird thing that is unnecessary.
[08:10.600 --> 08:12.600]  So just watch three videos and figure out...
[08:12.600 --> 08:13.600]  Do the math on that.
[08:13.600 --> 08:14.600]  Yeah, get the median.
[08:14.600 --> 08:15.600]  There you go.
[08:15.600 --> 08:16.600]  All right, so select the...
[08:16.600 --> 08:18.200]  Figure out why you're going to shoot.
[08:18.200 --> 08:20.520]  Select the best camera you can for your purpose.
[08:20.520 --> 08:23.540]  If you're going to go shooting for Instagram, don't buy a $1,000 camera.
[08:23.540 --> 08:25.600]  Don't buy the D30 for Instagram shots.
[08:25.600 --> 08:26.960]  Unless you can afford it.
[08:26.960 --> 08:27.960]  And that's...
[08:27.960 --> 08:31.600]  You know, if you want the best pictures on Instagram...
[08:31.600 --> 08:32.600]  You will have the best probably.
[08:32.600 --> 08:33.600]  There you go.
[08:33.600 --> 08:34.600]  Some of the best.
[08:34.600 --> 08:35.600]  If you want the crispest...
[08:35.600 --> 08:36.600]  That's not a word.
[08:36.600 --> 08:39.160]  If you want the crispiest pictures possible.
[08:39.160 --> 08:41.800]  How many times do we have to say a word to make it a word around here?
[08:41.800 --> 08:42.800]  It won't take long.
[08:42.800 --> 08:44.320]  All right, so then select...
[08:44.320 --> 08:47.680]  Get the best camera you can, you guys, and then learn it.
[08:47.680 --> 08:51.560]  And also while you're shopping, there are a couple of accessories that...
[08:51.560 --> 08:52.760]  We talked about this a little bit before.
[08:52.760 --> 08:56.120]  There are definitely some accessories that we would all recommend.
[08:56.120 --> 08:58.160]  While you're shopping, get yourself a tripod.
[08:58.160 --> 08:59.160]  Yes.
[08:59.160 --> 09:00.160]  Don't get a...
[09:00.160 --> 09:01.160]  Sorry to interrupt.
[09:01.160 --> 09:02.160]  No, do it.
[09:02.160 --> 09:03.720]  Don't get a cheap tripod.
[09:03.720 --> 09:07.920]  Like there are tripods out there for $20 and $30, which will work, but they're plastic
[09:07.920 --> 09:13.480]  and they're soft and they're not meant to last and they're not meant to really be hauled
[09:13.480 --> 09:14.720]  around and that kind of stuff.
[09:14.720 --> 09:16.880]  And if you're not going to haul it around and you're just going to leave it in one place
[09:16.880 --> 09:19.800]  and take pictures always, buy that $20 or $30 one.
[09:19.800 --> 09:25.000]  But the difference between a $30 tripod and a $70 tripod is giant.
[09:25.000 --> 09:26.280]  It's metal.
[09:26.280 --> 09:27.360]  It's very sturdy.
[09:27.360 --> 09:28.720]  It's going to last forever.
[09:28.720 --> 09:30.920]  It will last as many cameras as you could buy.
[09:30.920 --> 09:33.320]  I ruined my $30 tripod quite quickly.
[09:33.320 --> 09:36.000]  The height adjustment stripped out so it's stuck at one height.
[09:36.000 --> 09:38.320]  If I want to move it up, I got to like yank it.
[09:38.320 --> 09:41.280]  So I've got the $70 Dynex one that they have at Best Buy.
[09:41.280 --> 09:42.280]  Dude, great investment.
[09:42.280 --> 09:43.280]  I agree.
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.240]  The tripod will make your pictures, your photos will be not wobbly.
[09:46.240 --> 09:49.480]  You'll be able to leave the shutter open a little bit longer because you're not holding
[09:49.480 --> 09:50.480]  it.
[09:50.480 --> 09:53.000]  And no matter how steady you think you are, you're shaking.
[09:53.000 --> 09:54.000]  Yes.
[09:54.000 --> 09:56.620]  And the way physics works, think about like a flashlight.
[09:56.620 --> 09:59.000]  If you turn the flashlight, you make a nice arc with the light.
[09:59.000 --> 10:00.000]  You're doing that with the lens.
[10:00.000 --> 10:01.040]  You're not just wobbling it.
[10:01.040 --> 10:05.000]  You're waving the whole end of the lens because the part that's shooting is wiggling in a
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  much...
[10:06.000 --> 10:07.800]  Yeah, you're making a cone shape.
[10:07.800 --> 10:08.800]  Sorry, that's science.
[10:08.800 --> 10:09.800]  We'll move on.
[10:09.800 --> 10:11.280]  Also, get yourself a nice case.
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.320]  If you can get a bag, a soft bag or a case or something for the camera, do that because
[10:15.320 --> 10:16.840]  you're going to want to carry extra lenses.
[10:16.840 --> 10:18.560]  You're going to want to carry a lens cleaner.
[10:18.560 --> 10:23.160]  You need a little soft cloth to clean off the lens, especially when shooting cannabis.
[10:23.160 --> 10:26.680]  My lens is freaking sticky all the time.
[10:26.680 --> 10:27.680]  It's I got to clean it off.
[10:27.680 --> 10:31.360]  I get too close to the plants or something and then just you touch it and then it trichomes
[10:31.360 --> 10:32.360]  all over your lens.
[10:32.360 --> 10:33.880]  Old cotton t-shirts.
[10:33.880 --> 10:34.880]  Nothing wrong with that.
[10:34.960 --> 10:35.960]  Okay.
[10:35.960 --> 10:36.960]  No socks.
[10:36.960 --> 10:37.960]  Don't use a sock.
[10:37.960 --> 10:38.960]  Actually, a fresh sock.
[10:38.960 --> 10:39.960]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[10:39.960 --> 10:40.960]  Okay.
[10:40.960 --> 10:42.960]  Anything that's soft, don't use like...
[10:42.960 --> 10:43.960]  Anything soft.
[10:43.960 --> 10:46.680]  I'm not going to tell you what not to use, but it's really okay.
[10:46.680 --> 10:48.800]  Don't press too hard to scratch up the lens.
[10:48.800 --> 10:52.160]  I personally like to go to the sunglasses store and get that little rag that they use
[10:52.160 --> 10:53.160]  to clean your sunglasses.
[10:53.160 --> 10:54.160]  Microfiber cloth?
[10:54.160 --> 10:55.160]  Yes, a microfiber.
[10:55.160 --> 10:56.160]  That's what it's called.
[10:56.160 --> 10:57.160]  I think that works perfect for my camera lens.
[10:57.160 --> 10:58.160]  All right.
[10:58.160 --> 10:59.160]  So then...
[10:59.160 --> 11:00.160]  Don't skimp on the case either.
[11:00.160 --> 11:04.480]  Cases, backpacks, a $70, $100 case.
[11:05.080 --> 11:08.680]  You're putting a $1,000 camera in it maybe and a $1,000 lens.
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.720]  What's a $100 case versus a $50 case that gets thrown at the airport or something?
[11:13.720 --> 11:14.720]  I don't know.
[11:14.720 --> 11:15.720]  Right.
[11:15.720 --> 11:18.360]  But I'm all about initial investment.
[11:18.360 --> 11:19.360]  I agree.
[11:19.360 --> 11:20.360]  Get a Pelican case.
[11:20.360 --> 11:21.360]  Yeah, get a Pelican for your camera.
[11:21.360 --> 11:24.520]  A Pelican case is not too shabby, especially if you're traveling.
[11:24.520 --> 11:29.680]  You know the best way to not get your camera stolen out of your vehicle when you're traveling?
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.680]  Cover it up?
[11:30.680 --> 11:32.680]  Hang it on your neck and take pictures with you while you're running around.
[11:32.680 --> 11:33.680]  Oh, yeah.
[11:33.880 --> 11:34.880]  You never know when a good thing with you.
[11:34.880 --> 11:35.880]  You never know when a good...
[11:35.880 --> 11:38.640]  The craziest shit happens when you don't have your camera with you.
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.800]  You can almost guarantee you're not going to get robbed.
[11:40.800 --> 11:41.800]  You're not going to get jacked.
[11:41.800 --> 11:44.440]  There won't be a catastrophe if you've got your camera on you.
[11:44.440 --> 11:47.680]  It didn't save Anthony Cumia.
[11:47.680 --> 11:49.960]  That's the greatest reference on this podcast, I think.
[11:49.960 --> 11:52.360]  Big shout out to Opie and Anthony.
[11:52.360 --> 11:53.360]  That was awesome.
[11:53.360 --> 11:54.360]  That was great.
[11:54.360 --> 11:55.440]  So get yourself a good tripod.
[11:55.440 --> 11:57.360]  Get yourself a good case.
[11:57.360 --> 11:58.360]  Get some lenses now.
[11:58.360 --> 12:01.680]  What kind of lenses for shooting cannabis photography?
[12:01.680 --> 12:02.960]  Could you recommend a few lenses?
[12:03.240 --> 12:07.520]  I don't want to give any specific lens to get just because everybody...
[12:07.520 --> 12:10.000]  I don't want it to be bad and then you say, oh, this guy said that.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  I love that.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.560]  But are you trying to take pictures of trichomes?
[12:13.560 --> 12:16.800]  Are you trying to take pictures of buds off the plant, on the plant?
[12:16.800 --> 12:19.280]  Do you want to take pictures of the whole plant?
[12:19.280 --> 12:20.960]  Different lenses are going to do different things.
[12:20.960 --> 12:28.000]  You can get shorter focal length plants or plants, shorter focal length lenses for portraits
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  and that's just really general.
[12:32.040 --> 12:35.720]  You can get all different.
[12:35.720 --> 12:36.720]  There's all different kinds of lenses.
[12:36.720 --> 12:38.960]  It really depends on what you want to do.
[12:38.960 --> 12:41.120]  And each camera is going to have different lenses.
[12:41.120 --> 12:42.360]  Each plant is going to have different lenses.
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.320]  If we're just talking about DSLRs right now, that's the only thing that lenses really apply
[12:46.320 --> 12:48.240]  to.
[12:48.240 --> 12:53.000]  Your lens and you're buying your lens and your body separate.
[12:53.000 --> 12:56.760]  I mean, if you're buying them in a box together, it's set.
[12:56.760 --> 12:58.320]  You're getting that for a reason.
[12:58.320 --> 13:04.680]  If you're buying the body that you want because the body has all the features that you want
[13:04.680 --> 13:09.560]  and then the lens because that lens has all the features that you want, it depends on
[13:09.560 --> 13:10.560]  what you want to do.
[13:10.560 --> 13:14.520]  So when it says body only, they're sending me a usable camera with no lens, essentially.
[13:14.520 --> 13:15.520]  Correct.
[13:15.520 --> 13:16.520]  Okay.
[13:16.520 --> 13:17.520]  Because that's misleading.
[13:17.520 --> 13:18.520]  I did not know anything about that when I was camera shopping.
[13:18.520 --> 13:19.720]  I was like, what the hell does that mean?
[13:19.720 --> 13:20.720]  Body only.
[13:20.720 --> 13:21.920]  I wondered if there were mechanics inside of there.
[13:21.920 --> 13:22.920]  Oh yeah.
[13:22.920 --> 13:23.920]  It's misleading.
[13:23.920 --> 13:25.120]  Is that like just the plastic or is there?
[13:25.120 --> 13:26.120]  Yeah.
[13:26.120 --> 13:27.120]  So now I know that.
[13:27.120 --> 13:28.120]  There you go, guys.
[13:28.920 --> 13:33.880]  But that said, you can certainly get lenses that fit all applications.
[13:33.880 --> 13:37.040]  You can get like the telephoto lens.
[13:37.040 --> 13:39.360]  It's telephoto and tele macro.
[13:39.360 --> 13:44.600]  So you like I use just as the easy lens for all aspects.
[13:44.600 --> 13:45.600]  I use it.
[13:45.600 --> 13:48.920]  I think it's an 18 to 200.
[13:48.920 --> 13:49.920]  It's a Nikon.
[13:49.920 --> 13:51.280]  That's a nice range.
[13:51.280 --> 13:52.600]  It's a huge range.
[13:52.600 --> 13:55.340]  It's and that fits anything that you want.
[13:55.340 --> 13:56.960]  You want to take a picture of a mountain?
[13:56.960 --> 13:57.960]  You're good.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  You want to take a picture of a tricone?
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  You're good.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  So.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  That's a huge.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  I got the 55 to 200 in my case right here.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  Yeah, there you go.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  That's this is my go to lens right here.
[14:05.000 --> 14:06.000]  This is what I use quite often.
[14:06.000 --> 14:07.000]  Everything that you needed to do without getting too specific.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  OK, so guys, what I use since Joe approves of my setup here, I'm using the Nikon D3200
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  and I bought the package that comes with the case and the two lenses.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  And I usually use the Nikon D3200.
[14:10.000 --> 14:11.000]  And I usually use the Nikon D3200.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  And I usually use the Nikon D3200.
[14:12.000 --> 14:13.000]  And I usually use the Nikon D3200.
[14:13.000 --> 14:14.000]  And I usually use the Nikon D3200.
[14:14.000 --> 14:15.000]  And I usually use the Nikon D3200.
[14:15.000 --> 14:33.100]  But when I want to get in there, sometimes it's hard to maneuver around the grow room
[14:33.100 --> 14:34.280]  to maneuver around the grow room.
[14:34.280 --> 14:38.060]  If you can't back up from the plant, if you're up close, then I'll switch to the,
[14:38.060 --> 14:40.520]  and I'm looking at the right number so I don't mislead anybody here.
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.180]  It's the 18 to 55 is the one I use when I can't maneuver around the room too well.
[14:46.360 --> 14:48.360]  If I'm further away, I go for this longer lens.
[14:48.360 --> 14:50.660]  If I'm close in tight, I use the 18 to 55.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.360]  I get much better shots with this, uh, 55 to 200 lens.
[14:54.360 --> 14:55.500]  This is my go-to right here.
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.920]  So when we're saying all of this, um, basically you to take the
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.780]  macro shots on that 55 to 200, you put it all the way to 200.
[15:06.280 --> 15:11.900]  And on a tripod and you're going to be about 18, 20 inches away from the nug,
[15:12.360 --> 15:16.920]  uh, with your 200 zoomed all the way out into that nug and that's how you're
[15:16.920 --> 15:20.960]  getting your macro shots in that specific zoomed all the way out or all the way in.
[15:21.680 --> 15:25.640]  Well, you're zoomed into what you're trying to, your 200 is
[15:25.860 --> 15:27.540]  extended as far as it will go.
[15:27.780 --> 15:29.500]  If you're, you set it to 200.
[15:29.760 --> 15:35.120]  So the lens is out super long and on your viewfinder, it's zoomed in on your subject.
[15:35.420 --> 15:35.920]  Okay.
[15:36.220 --> 15:40.840]  And then that's where you find your macro setting in that lens.
[15:40.880 --> 15:41.380]  Nice.
[15:42.120 --> 15:46.840]  Yeah, that's so that's, but that's in these types of lenses that do everything.
[15:46.840 --> 15:48.760]  I think I've been off the mic for so much of this.
[15:48.880 --> 15:49.900]  Oh no, I've got you up loud enough.
[15:49.900 --> 15:50.400]  Okay.
[15:51.120 --> 15:53.800]  The, but that, that's, so those are my mics.
[15:53.820 --> 15:56.160]  Those are lenses that do everything.
[15:56.260 --> 16:01.220]  If you want to take pictures of just the trichomes, you know, really close up
[16:01.660 --> 16:05.260]  things going on in your garden, you could take, you know, awesome pictures of soil.
[16:05.300 --> 16:06.340]  Who knows what you'll find in there.
[16:06.700 --> 16:11.020]  You could take pictures of a whole nugs trichomes.
[16:11.020 --> 16:12.140]  That's really what you're looking for.
[16:12.260 --> 16:16.940]  You want to get like a dedicated macro lens, something that won't take pictures
[16:16.940 --> 16:20.180]  of mountains, something that won't take pictures of your family.
[16:20.420 --> 16:24.660]  Nothing, no portraits, just little tiny stuff, just little things.
[16:24.700 --> 16:25.200]  Okay.
[16:25.340 --> 16:28.700]  But yeah, get the right lens for the right job is kind of exactly do your
[16:28.700 --> 16:29.200]  research.
[16:29.460 --> 16:31.940]  Look for something that's going to shoot in five to one.
[16:32.820 --> 16:38.380]  That's all about a full, full resolution on big prints essentially.
[16:38.420 --> 16:38.920]  Okay.
[16:39.220 --> 16:45.980]  Uh, like if you have an eight by 11 picture, uh, of a trichome and it's
[16:45.980 --> 16:50.400]  perfectly in focused and beautiful, that's because somebody was using like a
[16:50.400 --> 16:56.860]  five to one lens that would allow you to shoot that whole frame.
[16:57.220 --> 16:57.720]  Okay.
[16:57.720 --> 16:58.220]  That makes sense.
[16:58.380 --> 16:58.880]  I get it.
[16:59.100 --> 17:00.380]  You're zoomed into life.
[17:00.380 --> 17:01.980]  Like you're zoomed into real life.
[17:03.020 --> 17:06.060]  So basically people got to know what they're aiming for and that can lead us
[17:06.060 --> 17:07.020]  into another part of this.
[17:07.060 --> 17:10.460]  Uh, we're going to kind of skip a little part of the notes that we made, but, uh,
[17:10.460 --> 17:13.380]  instead of just, no, no, I like, I like it when it flows.
[17:14.300 --> 17:14.820]  No, I like it.
[17:14.820 --> 17:16.740]  I'm the one skipping it because I like the way that it's flowing.
[17:16.740 --> 17:17.240]  It flows better.
[17:17.240 --> 17:17.740]  We'll do that.
[17:18.080 --> 17:21.880]  Instead of just shooting at random shit, kind of plan out your shot.
[17:21.880 --> 17:22.160]  Also.
[17:22.160 --> 17:22.840]  That's a good thing.
[17:22.840 --> 17:23.500]  That's a good point.
[17:23.500 --> 17:26.400]  Since Joe's talking about your lens, you're going to have to know what you're
[17:26.400 --> 17:30.120]  aiming for when you put this lens on your camera, you can't go putting on your
[17:30.120 --> 17:34.240]  macro lens and then try to take a picture of the top Cola, you got to get your 200
[17:34.240 --> 17:35.840]  lens out to take pictures of the top.
[17:36.000 --> 17:36.160]  Right.
[17:36.160 --> 17:38.720]  Kind of know what you're aiming for, plan your shot.
[17:39.080 --> 17:39.580]  And.
[17:40.000 --> 17:43.320]  Uh, like, think about, like Joe said, if you want to take a picture of a trichome
[17:43.320 --> 17:46.520]  or if you want to take a picture of some soil, think about it and you'll, you'll
[17:46.520 --> 17:49.040]  see it when you walk through the grow room, something will go right here.
[17:49.060 --> 17:49.600]  Look at this.
[17:49.600 --> 17:53.020]  And when it catches your eye, that means it catches the camera and try to stand
[17:53.020 --> 17:54.340]  where you were when it got your eye.
[17:54.340 --> 17:56.380]  Try to try to replicate that a little bit.
[17:56.500 --> 18:01.820]  Don't, uh, don't be scared to take a lot of pictures of even the same thing.
[18:01.820 --> 18:05.540]  And then, you know, there'll be that one that's just like, this is the one.
[18:05.540 --> 18:08.300]  Like if you have the time to, you know, I don't know, take some dabs and
[18:08.300 --> 18:10.940]  look through your pictures, like the magic of memory cards.
[18:11.540 --> 18:12.080]  Exactly.
[18:12.080 --> 18:13.260]  We're not wasting film anymore.
[18:13.280 --> 18:14.780]  We're just clicking away on a memory card.
[18:14.780 --> 18:18.020]  We're wasting RAM and we can delete it all and do it all over again tomorrow.
[18:18.520 --> 18:19.760]  So yeah, just plan out your shot.
[18:20.120 --> 18:21.600]  Uh, choose the right lens for your shot.
[18:21.600 --> 18:21.800]  Yeah.
[18:21.800 --> 18:27.520]  And on just, just to make a correction on that with the 200, the 55 to 200, when
[18:27.520 --> 18:31.240]  you're at 200, I don't want anybody to think that you can take a picture of a
[18:31.240 --> 18:32.600]  trichome with the 200.
[18:32.800 --> 18:33.560]  It won't work that way.
[18:33.600 --> 18:33.760]  Yeah.
[18:33.760 --> 18:35.360]  I was kind of thinking that you can take.
[18:35.800 --> 18:36.500]  A picture.
[18:36.520 --> 18:40.360]  You can take really close up, good shots of nugs on your plant.
[18:40.400 --> 18:44.180]  You could take where you will see each individual trichome as a dot.
[18:44.360 --> 18:48.080]  Sometimes the stock, just depending on how good the lighting is, but don't think
[18:48.080 --> 18:53.960]  you're going to get that real super official macro photography with, without
[18:53.960 --> 18:55.760]  a macro specific lens.
[18:56.320 --> 18:58.280]  I just wrote something down to try not to forget it.
[18:58.640 --> 19:02.320]  Uh, we're going to go into lighting next because you just hinted on that, but you
[19:02.320 --> 19:05.520]  guys, one huge hint I can give you just super quickly, get yourself either a
[19:05.520 --> 19:08.160]  method seven lens or I totally forgot about it.
[19:08.160 --> 19:09.520]  Or yeah, we both use them.
[19:09.640 --> 19:10.200]  I have them.
[19:10.560 --> 19:11.120]  They're amazing.
[19:11.160 --> 19:11.360]  Yeah.
[19:11.360 --> 19:14.040]  So get your, it's either, or you can just put the sunglasses right over
[19:14.060 --> 19:14.540]  your camera.
[19:14.540 --> 19:15.980]  If you're ghetto, you can do that too.
[19:15.980 --> 19:16.580]  That works.
[19:17.140 --> 19:18.300]  But yeah, that does work.
[19:18.340 --> 19:22.580]  Method seven makes a filter that cuts out the, uh, the HID, the high
[19:22.580 --> 19:23.700]  intensity discharge light.
[19:23.700 --> 19:26.540]  It cuts that color out and you can see the natural color of your plants.
[19:26.780 --> 19:29.460]  So if you're not able to take the plants out of the room, uh, the
[19:29.460 --> 19:31.060]  method seven lens is a good way to go.
[19:31.300 --> 19:32.940]  So let's work into lighting a little bit.
[19:33.180 --> 19:36.420]  How should we be lighting our cannabis plants when we're taking pictures?
[19:36.540 --> 19:38.740]  Uh, ideally not around HPS lights.
[19:38.980 --> 19:40.740]  Uh, not even T five lights.
[19:40.780 --> 19:41.540]  That's not true light.
[19:41.620 --> 19:42.500]  I mean, it's super white.
[19:42.680 --> 19:46.760]  It looks good, but it's not the true representation of your plant.
[19:46.880 --> 19:47.120]  Okay.
[19:47.120 --> 19:49.360]  Uh, it puts a little bit of a blue to it.
[19:49.360 --> 19:53.960]  I've noticed certainly it could put any hue on it, just depending on the
[19:54.080 --> 19:57.360]  other lights in the room or a number of factors.
[19:57.360 --> 19:57.840]  Exactly.
[19:57.840 --> 19:58.480]  From yeah.
[19:58.600 --> 19:58.960]  Okay.
[19:59.080 --> 20:04.760]  So your lighting, what's easiest, you know, get in a room with really good
[20:04.800 --> 20:09.880]  outside lighting or, you know, a whole bunch of CFLs, they're pretty, pretty
[20:09.880 --> 20:13.260]  flat, white, easy to color balance off of your camera.
[20:13.420 --> 20:15.780]  If you want to get into your settings and do that, but that's ideal.
[20:16.420 --> 20:19.620]  If you don't have that and you have to stay in your girl room, you know, turn
[20:19.620 --> 20:24.500]  the HPS lights off and just turn your overhead light on, uh, and use a flash.
[20:24.820 --> 20:25.140]  Okay.
[20:25.220 --> 20:27.580]  Uh, a flash will overcome a lot.
[20:27.940 --> 20:31.060]  Is the, uh, the stock flash that came on most of our DSL cameras
[20:31.060 --> 20:32.780]  is going to be DSL, our cameras.
[20:32.780 --> 20:33.580]  Is that going to be good enough?
[20:33.580 --> 20:36.700]  Or should we get like a ring, like a, like an aftermarket flash?
[20:36.700 --> 20:40.500]  If you can afford an aftermarket flash, it is going to be a lot far
[20:40.500 --> 20:42.680]  superior to the one built in, but.
[20:43.840 --> 20:46.140]  That one that's built in is not too shabby either.
[20:46.140 --> 20:48.900]  It will definitely get the job done for most applications.
[20:48.960 --> 20:49.160]  Okay.
[20:49.160 --> 20:53.880]  When you're getting an aftermarket flash, you should really know why you're
[20:53.880 --> 20:55.960]  about to spend $160 on a flash.
[20:56.240 --> 20:58.520]  Like there's, there's a, there's reasons for it.
[20:58.520 --> 21:02.160]  And I don't want to tell you what they are because that's cheating.
[21:02.640 --> 21:03.440]  Figure out the reason.
[21:03.460 --> 21:03.840]  Nice.
[21:05.280 --> 21:06.600]  But we'll get to some reasons later.
[21:07.240 --> 21:07.440]  Yeah.
[21:07.880 --> 21:08.240]  All right.
[21:08.480 --> 21:10.800]  So more lighting is usually the key, right?
[21:10.840 --> 21:13.760]  More lighting, more lighting, the better sunlight, if you can.
[21:13.780 --> 21:18.160]  Sunlight's the most ideal, but I know everybody can't take their plants outside.
[21:18.200 --> 21:18.400]  Yeah.
[21:18.440 --> 21:21.340]  My favorite meme is the old lady looking out the window and it says, there's my
[21:21.340 --> 21:24.000]  neighbor taking pictures of his bongs in the sunlight again.
[21:24.040 --> 21:24.920]  That's fantastic.
[21:24.940 --> 21:25.160]  Yeah.
[21:25.200 --> 21:25.360]  Yeah.
[21:25.360 --> 21:26.680]  You see it on Instagram all the time.
[21:26.680 --> 21:29.740]  Well, I do because I follow usually pot plants, glass and pit
[21:29.740 --> 21:31.200]  bulls as my Instagram feed.
[21:32.800 --> 21:33.200]  Popular.
[21:33.200 --> 21:35.400]  And, and ladies don't handle it.
[21:35.440 --> 21:36.200]  And some ladies.
[21:36.380 --> 21:37.100]  Yeah, you're right.
[21:37.100 --> 21:37.640]  I'll be honest.
[21:37.640 --> 21:38.260]  And some movies.
[21:39.860 --> 21:40.140]  All right.
[21:40.620 --> 21:42.020]  Let's, let's try to get back on track slot.
[21:42.060 --> 21:42.340]  Come on.
[21:42.820 --> 21:45.020]  Um, so I wrote down settings.
[21:45.020 --> 21:49.140]  What kind of settings should I throw my, is it cool to just walk in there on auto?
[21:49.220 --> 21:51.140]  So start auto firing or do I need to?
[21:51.260 --> 21:52.060]  That's totally fine.
[21:52.100 --> 21:52.980]  There's nothing wrong with that.
[21:52.980 --> 21:53.700]  You'll get pictures.
[21:53.700 --> 21:55.280]  That'll be, it'll be useful.
[21:55.540 --> 21:59.740]  They might not be the best, but there certainly will be usable compared to.
[22:00.380 --> 22:03.340]  If you just throw it in manual without knowing anything, you know,
[22:03.340 --> 22:04.300]  it'll probably just be black.
[22:04.920 --> 22:11.040]  Uh, but settings you, you, when you don't have ideal, I'd say
[22:11.040 --> 22:12.720]  throw it in auto for the most of it.
[22:12.720 --> 22:14.760]  There's no, there's no reason to not use auto.
[22:14.760 --> 22:18.920]  If you have great lighting, auto is the best setting, uh, just
[22:18.920 --> 22:21.040]  because it will continually correct.
[22:21.320 --> 22:23.480]  It will just make everything easy and pretty.
[22:23.480 --> 22:27.080]  And you can focus on taking the pictures, especially if you're not getting paid.
[22:27.440 --> 22:32.200]  Like you don't need to be 1000% perfect on everything.
[22:32.240 --> 22:32.800]  Very true.
[22:32.820 --> 22:36.700]  If they're just for your Instagram feed, you don't need to be all critical about it.
[22:36.700 --> 22:38.900]  Of course, if you want to be critical, more power to you.
[22:38.920 --> 22:39.140]  Yeah.
[22:39.140 --> 22:39.860]  That's part of the art.
[22:39.900 --> 22:40.540]  If you're into that.
[22:40.660 --> 22:44.260]  The settings, uh, you, so settings are going to be for what, if you want to take
[22:44.260 --> 22:49.300]  pictures in the dark, just using flash randomly to overcome the HPS or when the
[22:49.300 --> 22:55.060]  HPSs are on and you have to change the setting in your camera to filter out that
[22:55.300 --> 22:58.220]  on the fly, don't be afraid to change settings.
[22:58.220 --> 23:00.180]  You guys, it's something you're going to have to learn to do with the camera.
[23:00.180 --> 23:04.360]  It's something I've just recently accepted is that every shot I may have to
[23:04.360 --> 23:05.720]  change a setting or two.
[23:05.880 --> 23:07.200]  I didn't realize it was going to be that way.
[23:07.200 --> 23:10.160]  When I started taking photos, I thought I could just go in there and put it on,
[23:10.480 --> 23:13.160]  you know, put the after setting here, turn the ISO to here, put the white
[23:13.160 --> 23:15.800]  balance here and just go in there and shoot from every angle and it'd be legit.
[23:15.800 --> 23:20.960]  But you want to shoot from, you want to take all the pictures you want to take
[23:20.960 --> 23:26.160]  from the, without moving basically, uh, stand in one spot, take all the pictures
[23:26.160 --> 23:28.600]  you want to take and move to the next spot, take all the pictures you want to
[23:28.600 --> 23:30.300]  take and do it systematically.
[23:30.340 --> 23:30.700]  Okay.
[23:31.380 --> 23:34.900]  I mean, I'm not trying to tell anybody what to do, but that's what I find,
[23:35.260 --> 23:38.820]  especially when you're going through your pictures and everything is grouped.
[23:38.860 --> 23:42.180]  I mean, you're going to be sitting down, standing up, leaning over, leaning
[23:42.180 --> 23:45.180]  backwards in one spot without moving too much.
[23:45.180 --> 23:48.780]  So you can really get a good feel of what that angle is bringing to the table.
[23:48.980 --> 23:49.220]  Yeah.
[23:49.220 --> 23:50.700]  And don't be afraid to take weird angles.
[23:50.700 --> 23:52.780]  You guys, some of the best shots are really weird angles.
[23:52.780 --> 23:55.940]  Yeah, experiment, have fun, hang off of a ladder upside down backwards and
[23:55.940 --> 23:56.540]  take a picture.
[23:57.260 --> 23:57.740]  That's right.
[23:57.760 --> 23:57.940]  Yep.
[23:57.960 --> 23:58.960]  Good shit comes out of there.
[23:59.440 --> 23:59.720]  All right.
[23:59.720 --> 24:01.060]  So we talked about settings a little bit.
[24:01.060 --> 24:02.880]  We got lighting, we got lens selection.
[24:03.480 --> 24:05.320]  Uh, sloppy brought up a great point earlier.
[24:05.560 --> 24:10.840]  A slop asked me, uh, what is acceptable editing for cannabis photography?
[24:11.240 --> 24:12.440]  And Joe had a great answer.
[24:12.460 --> 24:13.640]  I'll let you give that answer.
[24:13.760 --> 24:16.560]  It's just don't, don't edit maliciously.
[24:16.640 --> 24:17.080]  Yes.
[24:17.160 --> 24:20.120]  Uh, by that Joe means like myself, I'm a seed breeder, right?
[24:20.380 --> 24:21.040]  I own a company.
[24:21.040 --> 24:21.920]  I try to sell seeds.
[24:21.920 --> 24:25.800]  If I were to edit the photos I take of the plants that come from my seeds, I
[24:25.800 --> 24:27.100]  feel like it would be misleading.
[24:27.600 --> 24:28.920]  Uh, I edited out the background.
[24:28.920 --> 24:29.860]  I edited out people.
[24:29.880 --> 24:31.200]  I edited out other plants.
[24:31.200 --> 24:33.840]  If there's another plant next to it, I'll go ahead and blur that one.
[24:33.840 --> 24:35.320]  But I don't edit the subject.
[24:35.760 --> 24:36.460]  Uh, at all.
[24:36.460 --> 24:41.560]  Most of the time, like 99% of my Instagram and my website are all unedited.
[24:42.040 --> 24:44.160]  And if they are edited, you can tell because it's black and
[24:44.160 --> 24:45.580]  white or it's something awkward.
[24:46.320 --> 24:48.880]  But if you're in there making the pistols pink and you're trying to sell a
[24:48.880 --> 24:51.680]  pack of seeds and those pistols weren't pink, that's what we'll call malicious
[24:51.680 --> 24:52.040]  editing.
[24:52.060 --> 24:52.880]  Don't do that shit.
[24:52.880 --> 24:56.200]  But if you're doing it for art, like if you're doing it for like, look at this
[24:56.220 --> 24:57.700]  beautiful cannabis plant, that's cool.
[24:57.700 --> 25:00.860]  But if you're trying to take credit for growing this beautiful plant, don't go
[25:00.860 --> 25:02.340]  fucking with the colors and misleading people.
[25:02.340 --> 25:03.340]  Don't false advertise.
[25:03.340 --> 25:04.980]  Don't try to trick anyone.
[25:05.060 --> 25:05.460]  Yeah.
[25:05.780 --> 25:06.260]  And that's all.
[25:06.260 --> 25:06.620]  That's all.
[25:06.660 --> 25:07.580]  That's damn tricksters.
[25:07.620 --> 25:08.700]  Editing is a lot of fun though.
[25:08.900 --> 25:09.060]  Yeah.
[25:09.060 --> 25:09.940]  Oh, and it's great.
[25:09.980 --> 25:14.780]  And there are certain instances, uh, when you have to edit, like if you weren't,
[25:14.980 --> 25:19.700]  you know, you're not always in the best condition for pictures, you don't always
[25:19.700 --> 25:22.220]  have the best opportunity to take a picture.
[25:22.940 --> 25:25.460]  Sometimes you just have to snap, snap, snap, snap.
[25:25.520 --> 25:26.400]  You've got to brighten it up.
[25:26.400 --> 25:29.320]  And then you got to come back to some Photoshop and clean it up.
[25:29.440 --> 25:29.680]  Yep.
[25:29.840 --> 25:31.120]  Which is acceptable at that point.
[25:31.120 --> 25:32.480]  It just depends on what you're doing with it.
[25:33.120 --> 25:33.880]  Yeah, I agree.
[25:33.920 --> 25:34.280]  All right.
[25:34.600 --> 25:39.800]  So, uh, now that you've learned how to, uh, select a camera, you've got all your
[25:39.800 --> 25:42.720]  accessories, you figured out what kind of lenses you're going to use.
[25:42.720 --> 25:44.200]  You got a cool light to play with.
[25:44.640 --> 25:46.340]  Uh, you've been tweaking on the camera settings.
[25:46.340 --> 25:49.640]  You learned how to do some editing and you just got to get there in a grow room or
[25:49.640 --> 25:52.000]  wherever your plants are and just take a shitload of pictures.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.920]  You guys just take pictures, change the settings.
[25:55.720 --> 25:56.760]  Uh, play with the settings.
[25:56.760 --> 25:57.280]  Don't be afraid.
[25:57.280 --> 25:59.480]  Like I said earlier, don't be afraid to get out of auto.
[25:59.660 --> 26:03.400]  If you get out of auto mode, I like to take pictures in auto and then take a note
[26:03.400 --> 26:08.800]  on where, what auto did auto will say everything auto put the ISO at this or
[26:08.800 --> 26:10.520]  the white balance or the shutter speed.
[26:10.840 --> 26:12.040]  Or the aperture setting was here.
[26:12.040 --> 26:15.200]  I auto will take a note for you in the photo if you save it right.
[26:15.540 --> 26:17.600]  And then look at that note and then write that down.
[26:17.600 --> 26:20.440]  And then if you've got a really killer picture, try to duplicate that
[26:20.440 --> 26:21.920]  setting in that environment.
[26:21.920 --> 26:25.580]  And then remember, like when I was in this setting, this environment, last
[26:25.580 --> 26:28.640]  time I threw on this setting and I took really killer pictures and then you'll
[26:28.640 --> 26:29.900]  start making mental notes of it.
[26:29.900 --> 26:31.700]  And you'll just, it'll start coming naturally to you.
[26:32.000 --> 26:32.900]  That's really nifty.
[26:33.240 --> 26:34.180]  That's that's crazy.
[26:34.180 --> 26:35.220]  I didn't know that it did that.
[26:35.360 --> 26:35.580]  Yeah.
[26:35.580 --> 26:38.940]  If, uh, it shows on the camera, if you, if you save it, if you've got a decent
[26:38.940 --> 26:41.860]  camera, a good expensive camera, it'll show you what the settings were when you
[26:41.860 --> 26:42.200]  take it.
[26:42.500 --> 26:46.260]  And unfortunately a lot of those cameras are also putting GPS locations in there.
[26:46.480 --> 26:48.780]  So you got to go turn that setting off in your camera.
[26:48.780 --> 26:49.940]  That's a good tip.
[26:49.940 --> 26:51.060]  You guys turn off.
[26:51.360 --> 26:51.560]  Yeah.
[26:51.560 --> 26:53.320]  You don't want location is the future.
[26:53.400 --> 26:53.680]  Yes.
[26:53.680 --> 26:54.760]  So shut that off.
[26:54.840 --> 26:55.160]  Yes.
[26:55.320 --> 26:57.200]  No good metadata in your camera.
[26:57.200 --> 26:57.960]  You don't want that.
[26:58.400 --> 27:01.600]  So, uh, and then go take pictures, you guys, and then just start
[27:01.600 --> 27:02.800]  planning out better shots.
[27:02.820 --> 27:04.980]  Just start shooting more and then you'll learn how to set it.
[27:05.220 --> 27:06.580]  You'll learn how to get to a better setting.
[27:06.580 --> 27:09.480]  You learn how to plan out your shot, frame your shot, and then you'll
[27:09.480 --> 27:10.880]  learn more how to edit them.
[27:11.240 --> 27:15.160]  And then I think that'll put you on the way to making amazing photography.
[27:15.160 --> 27:20.940]  And then you can have 17 to 25 to 55,000 followers on Instagram and you can be
[27:20.940 --> 27:23.920]  in the club, take notes when you do it.
[27:23.960 --> 27:24.420]  There you go.
[27:24.420 --> 27:24.720]  Slop.
[27:24.720 --> 27:26.940]  How many Instagram followers do you have over there?
[27:27.560 --> 27:31.080]  Uh, I think I have like 1734.
[27:31.080 --> 27:32.880]  So I'm not, I'm not that crazy.
[27:32.880 --> 27:33.120]  Yeah.
[27:33.240 --> 27:33.640]  Yeah.
[27:33.640 --> 27:34.640]  Well, it's pretty good, man.
[27:34.640 --> 27:35.640]  I remember when you moved here.
[27:35.880 --> 27:36.440]  Oh yeah.
[27:36.480 --> 27:36.840]  Yeah.
[27:36.880 --> 27:38.120]  Like 400.
[27:38.920 --> 27:39.960]  So you've gone a long way.
[27:40.480 --> 27:40.800]  All right.
[27:40.800 --> 27:43.480]  I feel like I've covered all of the notes that I've written down.
[27:43.760 --> 27:46.640]  I see that Joe's got a little, uh, uh, what do you call it?
[27:46.640 --> 27:47.840]  Bullet point thing over there.
[27:48.720 --> 27:48.960]  Yeah.
[27:48.960 --> 27:49.200]  Yeah.
[27:49.220 --> 27:53.020]  The only thing really that I would want to say is use the internet.
[27:53.420 --> 27:57.980]  It's an amazing resource for everything, you know, anything that you want to learn
[27:58.060 --> 28:00.820]  about anything, especially photography is out there.
[28:00.960 --> 28:05.160]  There's a lot of people who have blogs and YouTube channels.
[28:05.300 --> 28:07.820]  I like a guy that calls himself fro grows.
[28:07.900 --> 28:10.800]  I think he's got a YouTube channel on photography.
[28:11.100 --> 28:15.000]  Uh, a lot of photographers are kind of stale to watch because they're good at
[28:15.020 --> 28:17.180]  photography and not personal presentation.
[28:17.220 --> 28:17.500]  Yeah.
[28:17.520 --> 28:21.100]  But fro grows is definitely, uh, educational and entertaining.
[28:21.260 --> 28:21.500]  Sorry.
[28:21.500 --> 28:22.220]  I didn't mean to interrupt you.
[28:22.220 --> 28:22.940]  No, absolutely.
[28:23.180 --> 28:29.160]  That's all I'm saying is find somebody that you can, uh, watch and watch them
[28:29.180 --> 28:30.660]  work and you can learn a lot from them.
[28:30.820 --> 28:31.060]  Yeah.
[28:31.300 --> 28:33.700]  You can, it's such a crash course sometimes on YouTube.
[28:33.740 --> 28:35.740]  They just show you exactly what you want to see.
[28:36.340 --> 28:36.700]  All right.
[28:36.900 --> 28:38.260]  Hey slop, you got anything to say over there, bro?
[28:38.260 --> 28:38.940]  You look blazed.
[28:38.940 --> 28:39.780]  Uh, yeah.
[28:39.820 --> 28:44.700]  Don't be scared to use your imagination and just get in the grow room and get down
[28:44.720 --> 28:47.000]  on one knee or look at it from a weird angle.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.680]  Take pictures from inside the plant.
[28:48.680 --> 28:50.320]  Like really get in there.
[28:50.360 --> 28:52.560]  The possibilities for pictures are endless.
[28:52.600 --> 28:53.480]  Like do it.
[28:53.640 --> 28:55.920]  Your imagination is the only limit.
[28:56.040 --> 28:56.360]  Yeah.
[28:56.360 --> 28:57.960]  Yo, and imagination is key.
[28:59.080 --> 28:59.360]  All right guys.
[28:59.360 --> 29:00.760]  I think we've got a great podcast here.
[29:00.760 --> 29:02.400]  We should start wrapping this up while we're ahead.
[29:02.400 --> 29:02.720]  Right?
[29:03.320 --> 29:03.840]  Surely.
[29:04.160 --> 29:04.500]  All right.
[29:04.500 --> 29:04.800]  All right.
[29:04.800 --> 29:06.520]  You guys, we're going to be back in a couple of days.
[29:06.720 --> 29:09.680]  Uh, we're going to do another episode with sloppy and then I've got
[29:09.680 --> 29:11.280]  a couple other things planned out.
[29:11.720 --> 29:13.760]  So, uh, I'm going to wrap up the show and take some dabs.
[29:13.780 --> 29:15.220]  I want to thank you guys for joining me.

[29:45.920 --> 29:48.460]  If you tell me that the show is terrible, I will read it.
[29:48.760 --> 29:51.540]  I promise you, no matter what, I'm not going to say no matter what you write,
[29:51.820 --> 29:55.580]  but almost no matter what you write, iTunes will filter out any crazy shit.
[29:55.580 --> 29:56.540]  So you'd think so.
[29:56.800 --> 29:57.380]  I would hope so.
[29:57.660 --> 29:58.260]  So we'll see.
[29:58.500 --> 29:59.700]  Let's see what you guys can get through.

[30:09.940 --> 30:11.800]  You guys I'm on a Facebook.
[30:11.800 --> 30:12.560]  It's grow from your heart.
[30:12.580 --> 30:14.580]  I'm on Instagram under I read genetics.
[30:14.980 --> 30:15.740]  I'm on Twitter.
[30:15.740 --> 30:17.260]  It's at GFYH podcast.
[30:17.260 --> 30:17.540]  You guys.
[30:17.940 --> 30:19.460]  I'm so addicted to Periscope.
[30:19.700 --> 30:21.820]  I think everybody in this room is addicted to Periscope.
[30:21.860 --> 30:24.300]  Periscope is an app for your iPhone or your Android device.
[30:24.300 --> 30:25.700]  I've been talking about it quite heavily.
[30:25.980 --> 30:28.060]  Um, I'm going to have to take the needle out at some point.
[30:28.420 --> 30:30.740]  It's such a good, you know, keep doing it.
[30:30.780 --> 30:31.380]  It's amazing.
[30:31.380 --> 30:31.540]  Yeah.
[30:31.580 --> 30:31.860]  All right.
[30:31.860 --> 30:32.660]  I think it's awesome.
[30:32.980 --> 30:34.700]  I go on Periscope pressure.
[30:35.860 --> 30:38.660]  I go on Periscope once or twice a day and just ramble on about random
[30:38.660 --> 30:39.900]  shit that's happening in my life.
[30:40.280 --> 30:44.120]  Uh, I give words of wisdom and I also, uh, just talk about grown plants.
[30:44.120 --> 30:44.680]  It's pretty fun.
[30:44.920 --> 30:46.840]  So check that dude.
[30:46.840 --> 30:47.760]  I slay the trolls.
[30:47.800 --> 30:50.680]  I got my troll proof troll proof panties on.
[30:50.680 --> 30:51.360]  I ain't scared.
[30:51.880 --> 30:52.200]  All right.
[30:52.360 --> 30:53.340]  I better not say all that.
[30:53.340 --> 30:55.960]  Cause I just challenged people to leave comments and said, I'm troll proof.
[30:55.960 --> 30:56.760]  This is going to get there.
[30:56.760 --> 30:57.680]  Coming for you now.
[30:57.680 --> 30:58.240]  Yes, they are.
[30:58.240 --> 30:59.160]  No stopping this.
[30:59.160 --> 31:00.200]  A band hammer, bro.
[31:00.200 --> 31:00.960]  I'm not scared.
[31:01.960 --> 31:02.280]  All right.
[31:02.360 --> 31:04.440]  You guys don't forget that the show is available on iTunes.

[31:11.420 --> 31:11.960]  Uh, don't forget.

[31:17.220 --> 31:18.380]  bucks, you can go to my website.

[31:29.260 --> 31:31.500]  I'm trying to buy a zoom H six.
[31:31.780 --> 31:34.780]  So that I can take the podcast on the road, go do more recording with the
[31:34.800 --> 31:36.760]  Terpie boys, the Terpex crew with hunt.
[31:37.280 --> 31:38.760]  I'll take the show to more events.
[31:38.760 --> 31:39.600]  We'll do some more shit.
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.220]  If I have a mobile device that I can rely on, it'll be awesome.
[31:43.220 --> 31:46.480]  So if you want to contribute, I would give you a big shout out on the show.
[31:46.860 --> 31:48.560]  Uh, make sure you follow me on all the social media.
[31:48.560 --> 31:49.640]  I already begged for all that.
[31:49.960 --> 31:51.920]  Uh, you guys, I want to thank my guests for joining me.
[31:52.000 --> 31:52.800]  Awesome show you guys.
[31:52.800 --> 31:53.680]  I really appreciate it.
[31:53.800 --> 31:54.520]  That was a lot of fun.
[31:54.600 --> 31:55.360]  It was a lot of fun.
[31:55.440 --> 31:56.240]  Thanks for having us.
[31:56.280 --> 31:57.460]  Oh man, you guys will be back.
[31:57.480 --> 31:58.540]  We're going to record some more.
[31:58.900 --> 32:00.560]  A big shout out to my ninja Spence.
[32:00.640 --> 32:02.560]  He's got the coolest tattoo I've ever seen.
[32:02.580 --> 32:05.860]  He's got a tattoo of his dog, Nani on the back of his arm, the sweetest
[32:05.860 --> 32:07.540]  dog and the sweetest tattoos.
[32:07.540 --> 32:08.540]  So shout out to my ninja Spence.
[32:08.540 --> 32:10.460]  Thanks again for listening until next time.
[32:10.460 --> 32:12.940]  Take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[32:15.940 --> 32:18.380]  I and I will never fight down anything created by the most.
[32:18.380 --> 32:20.220]  I only see marijuana.
[32:20.660 --> 32:22.140]  It was a plan created by God.
[32:23.300 --> 32:25.500]  Some say they will love God, but I'm not love marijuana.
[32:28.440 --> 32:29.480]  Are you crazy?
[32:29.800 --> 32:30.680]  Are you crazy?
[32:30.680 --> 32:35.460]  I'm floating high.
[32:35.460 --> 32:36.820]  Can you see my eyes?
[32:37.060 --> 32:38.900]  I'm red, red, red, red.
[32:39.260 --> 32:40.140]  I've been to Zion.
[32:40.140 --> 32:40.740]  I am.
[32:40.740 --> 32:42.740]  I really want to hide in my head.
[32:42.740 --> 32:44.940]  Hit me.
[32:44.940 --> 32:45.300]  Skunk.
[32:45.300 --> 32:46.580]  Herb hit my brain.
[32:46.580 --> 32:46.940]  Nerve.
[32:47.260 --> 32:48.740]  I can't be misled.
[32:49.860 --> 32:50.580]  Both in purple.
[32:50.580 --> 32:51.100]  Haze.
[32:51.140 --> 32:52.940]  Let the fire blaze with some labs.
[32:52.980 --> 32:53.900]  Bread, bread, bread.
[32:54.580 --> 32:59.660]  So if you feel a way about the herb, let it be positive all the time.
[33:00.080 --> 33:04.920]  If you feel a way about the herb, remember that that's creation divine.
[33:05.280 --> 33:10.120]  If you feel a way about the herb, let it be positive all the time.
[33:10.520 --> 33:15.280]  If you feel a way about the herb, homegrown weed is the best weed to find.
