[01:00.200 --> 01:05.880]  Welcome back podcast world it is time for episode 566 of the grow from your heart podcast. Thank
[01:05.880 --> 01:09.640]  you again for joining me. Once again, let's send a big thank you shout out to my friend
[01:09.640 --> 01:15.640]  just a far I for the awesome intro track. I hope you guys enjoy that. I love that reggae air horn
[01:15.640 --> 01:20.840]  fits the show beautifully. Great way to kick off the show. All right. Usually I start the podcast
[01:20.840 --> 01:26.440]  off by talking about what I'm smoking today. I've been taking dabs of banana fosters full spectrum
[01:26.440 --> 01:32.120]  extract from green dot labs. This is banana og and Paris Larry on the package the flavor is
[01:32.120 --> 01:38.360]  described as banana, sugar and oatmeal. You know, I really enjoy this concentrate. The only bad
[01:38.360 --> 01:44.200]  thing about this concentrate is I've only got one fat dab left. Let me pull this little crystal here
[01:44.200 --> 01:48.440]  out of the container and show you this fat dab that I've got left. I've been saving this. This
[01:48.440 --> 01:53.320]  is probably going to be a special occasion dab. I don't know what the occasion may be. Maybe 710
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.160]  on Friday, something weird like that. But that's the only dab I've got left of the bananas. fosters
[01:59.160 --> 02:02.760]  full spectrum extract. I've been loving this concentrate. It's obviously got me nice and
[02:02.760 --> 02:09.880]  rambly nice and stony. On the back of the package. It says it does contain 84.43% THC
[02:09.880 --> 02:15.880]  and non detectable amounts of CBD. Big shout out to green dot labs for the delicious and
[02:15.880 --> 02:22.280]  turpy and potent bananas foster full spectrum extract. I feel like I caught my rhythm for this
[02:22.280 --> 02:28.360]  podcast. Let's give some shout outs to our friends who support the show on Patreon. Let's start off

[03:21.960 --> 03:27.240]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen. Alright, let's jump into the
[03:27.240 --> 03:35.240]  main topic of today's episode. I always say when you grow a plant for the first time, make sure you
[03:35.240 --> 03:40.680]  take a clone because sometimes you grow that plant and you realize it is the best shit you've ever
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.080]  grown and you really wish you could grow it again, but you don't have a clone. So now it is gone. So I
[03:45.080 --> 03:49.240]  always say take a clone. What if you fall in love with that seedling? What if you fall in love with
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.520]  that plant? Plants are seeds are they show variation, there's phenotypical variation in a
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.320]  package of seeds. So the chances of getting the exact same phenotype again from a seed depending
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.520]  on the breeding could be rare. You may find a gem, you may find a huge outlier, you may be like that
[04:04.520 --> 04:09.480]  was the most potent or the most medicinal or most relieving strain I've ever smoked. I wish I had
[04:09.480 --> 04:14.840]  that. You don't have a clone. What can we do? You didn't take a clone from it. The clones died, the
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.800]  cat ate the clones, the clone dome melted, something weird went on, you roasted the clones. We don't
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.160]  have a clone. What is our next solution? You can always take a clone in flower if you want to do
[04:25.160 --> 04:31.640]  that. If it's too late for that, there's one more option and that is re-vegging that plant. I've got
[04:31.640 --> 04:36.200]  a plant that I didn't think I wanted to run anymore. So now guess what I am doing? It has been
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.240]  re-vegged, it is spitting out re-vegged shoots. I'll catch you up with where I am in that project
[04:41.240 --> 04:46.280]  here in the end of the episode. But let's talk about re-vegging our cannabis plants.
[04:47.080 --> 04:53.320]  So the purpose is to preserve these genetics, to rejuvenate this plant so we can rerun this plant
[04:53.320 --> 04:57.480]  and put it back in our arsenal, our stable, our library to have this plant around.
[04:58.040 --> 05:02.920]  Unfortunately we flowered it out, we don't have a clone. Now we are going to re-veg. So here's how
[05:02.920 --> 05:09.080]  the re-veg happens. The way that I re-veg, it happens at the end of the flowering phase. If
[05:09.080 --> 05:13.800]  you were in control of the flowering phase of this garden, you are now also in control of an
[05:13.800 --> 05:21.320]  early re-veg process. During flush time, I usually do this about 10 days before harvest.
[05:21.320 --> 05:26.040]  A lot of times I'm running an awkward light schedule at the end of the flowering phase anyway,
[05:26.040 --> 05:32.280]  but I'm going to talk about that very briefly. I will turn my lights to 18-6 for the last 10 or 14
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.600]  days of flowering and that will speed up the flowering process. You'll get bigger, fatter,
[05:36.600 --> 05:43.160]  bulkier buds. I find it really helps. The last two weeks flush time, my lights are on 18-6. I think
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.400]  they're getting more energy and I'm going to cut them down before they show me any problems.
[05:47.400 --> 05:53.160]  Now if I do not cut them down and I leave them on that 18-6 light cycle, if I let them go for more
[05:53.160 --> 05:59.000]  than two weeks, I will start to see signs of re-veg. So if you're looking to re-veg the plants
[05:59.000 --> 06:06.600]  about 10 days before harvest, about flush time, put that light back on 18-6 or 24 hours of full
[06:06.600 --> 06:12.520]  light. 18-6 will work, 24 hours will work even more quickly. So you got 10 days before harvest time.
[06:12.520 --> 06:18.680]  Let's turn the light cycle on 18-6. Then let's flush as usual. Continue to flush. You should
[06:18.680 --> 06:23.080]  just be feeding water to the plants. Just nothing but water. It's flush time. We're trying to clean
[06:23.080 --> 06:27.880]  out that the whole root area. Get it nice and clean. Make those plants taste nice and good.
[06:27.880 --> 06:32.680]  Gonna flush like normal. Don't add anything. I always say this, flushing is free. Just use water.
[06:32.680 --> 06:37.480]  Water free right through the plant. There we go. Flush. Then we're going to harvest these plants,
[06:37.480 --> 06:42.120]  but we're going to do a little bit different technique than usual. We're going to harvest
[06:42.120 --> 06:46.440]  most of the up top parts of the plants. Toward the bottom of the plants, we're going to leave
[06:46.440 --> 06:51.400]  a couple of little buds, just thumb-sized nuggets. So you got the main stalk of the branch, main
[06:51.400 --> 06:56.120]  stalk of the plant coming up. It branches off a few times. You're going to cut off the main tops,
[06:56.120 --> 07:01.240]  those bottoms, the bottom thumb-sized buds. Leave four or five, maybe six of those, and those are
[07:01.240 --> 07:06.280]  going to become our new plant. Those are going to be the new shoots. That is what is going to re-veg.
[07:07.400 --> 07:11.480]  So now we have harvested and we've left some. Excuse me, I've got to clear the throat.
[07:13.080 --> 07:17.800]  All right, so we've harvested and we've left a few little nuggets on the bottom that are going to be
[07:17.800 --> 07:23.000]  our new vegetative growth. So those are going to continue to veg. We're going to leave the lights
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.880]  on 18, 6 or 24. We've got those little tiny nuggets there. The rest has been removed. It's
[07:27.880 --> 07:33.320]  being harvested, dried, cured, smoked, and enjoyed, processed just like normal. But now we've got this
[07:33.320 --> 07:37.640]  pot, your three or five gallon, seven, whatever size pot you've used, with just this little
[07:37.640 --> 07:41.720]  Charlie Brown Christmas tree looking piece of shit plant sticking out of it. It looks really sad.
[07:42.200 --> 07:48.440]  But it's been in a re-veg state. It's been being told, hey, I need you to re-veg for 10 to 14 days
[07:48.440 --> 07:52.680]  by now. And it's already going, hey, that light's been on for a long time. I'm not sure what we need
[07:52.680 --> 07:57.320]  to do here. I don't think I'm supposed to flower anymore because that's what I do when it's dark.
[07:57.320 --> 08:01.080]  Maybe I'm supposed to do the opposite. And it starts thinking, maybe I'll go back into veg.
[08:01.080 --> 08:05.320]  You'll start seeing the tops of the buds will get new little growth coming out of it, new fresh
[08:05.400 --> 08:12.520]  little growth. Eventually that growth will turn into new shoots. It will start to make new tops.
[08:12.520 --> 08:18.600]  This will happen slowly over time. When I mentioned pot sizes a moment ago, I realized I should talk
[08:18.600 --> 08:24.680]  about one more aspect. These plants have been in these pots for at least 13 weeks, I'm going to
[08:24.680 --> 08:28.760]  guess. You've got a nine-week flowering cycle. You probably had them in there for at least four
[08:28.760 --> 08:32.600]  weeks in veg in these pots, maybe two if you're really thinking about it. They've been in there
[08:32.600 --> 08:39.320]  for 11 weeks, maybe 12 weeks or longer. They may need to be up-potted into a larger pot. If you can
[08:39.320 --> 08:44.680]  carefully and methodically re-pot these pots, do it. If you think you may cause more harm than good,
[08:44.680 --> 08:49.400]  don't do it. But they're probably root-bound. Opening up that root zone, giving them some room
[08:49.400 --> 08:53.960]  to grow will let them know my shoes aren't too small, I can get bigger. They will continue to
[08:53.960 --> 08:59.160]  re-veg. But that's not a major issue if you think you're going to fuck the plants up by
[08:59.240 --> 09:03.560]  transplanting them. Don't do more harm than good. They're in there, they're small plants,
[09:03.560 --> 09:08.120]  that big root zone is going to sustain that small plant very well. It'll focus more on the energy up
[09:08.120 --> 09:14.280]  top. But if you can up-pot it, do that, but don't put yourself at risk doing it. So now, the plant's
[09:14.280 --> 09:18.760]  going to start making these little tiny, just nuggety type shoots coming out of the top.
[09:19.640 --> 09:23.880]  For a long time, they're going to look like shit. They're going to look really ugly. They almost
[09:23.880 --> 09:29.080]  look like dill or some sort of spice or something that you would find floating on the top of a fancy
[09:29.240 --> 09:33.320]  soup that you're not supposed to eat. It's just there for flavor and decoration. It doesn't look
[09:33.320 --> 09:40.360]  like cannabis for quite a while. It'll take probably 25 to 45 days, depending on the genetics,
[09:40.360 --> 09:45.320]  depending on the lights, depending on the nutrients, depending on the environment, depending
[09:45.320 --> 09:50.600]  on many, many things, the root-boundness, if that's even a word of that plant. A lot of things will
[09:50.600 --> 09:57.080]  determine how quickly this plant turns around. A lot of it is based on genetics. I've got multiple
[09:57.080 --> 10:02.680]  plants in one room that are being reveged, and I'm seeing different behaviors from these plants.
[10:02.680 --> 10:07.880]  One thing I can really tell you is that the age and size of the plant will heavily affect the way
[10:07.880 --> 10:13.240]  it reveges. Somebody gave me a bud from a flowering plant. They're like, I want you to rescue this.
[10:13.240 --> 10:19.000]  They brought me a bud from a flowering plant. It's really tiny. That really tiny one reveged
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.560]  much more quickly than a couple of bigger plants that I pulled out of a flower room and thought,
[10:23.560 --> 10:27.720]  shit, I don't have a happy clone of those. I want to keep those. Don't need to flower them this time.
[10:27.720 --> 10:32.040]  I'm going to pull those out of there. I'm reveging those. I'm also reveging one that was damn near
[10:32.040 --> 10:36.760]  finished. I'm seeing a lot of different results from plants that are in different phases. They're
[10:36.760 --> 10:40.680]  reveging at different times. Of course, the smaller one's going quickly. The one that was
[10:40.680 --> 10:44.360]  only into flower for about two weeks before I decided to pull it out, there's another trick
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.160]  that happened to that plant. I put a plant in flower for 18 days. When it produced enough
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.520]  pistils to be pollinated, I pollinated it. Then I put it back in veg. Now I've got that plant
[10:54.520 --> 11:00.040]  reveging with seeds in it. It only took me 18 days to pollinate that plant. I've got seeds out of that
[11:00.040 --> 11:03.640]  plant at this point. I pulled a couple of seeds out of it the other day. I'm not going to tell you
[11:03.640 --> 11:10.280]  what the cross was, but that was my new experiment. I vegged it until it was about probably 18, 12,
[11:10.280 --> 11:15.880]  18 inches tall. I put it into flower. It flowered for 18 days. I hit it with pollen. As soon as I
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.720]  knew the pollination was successful, I pulled that plant out, put it back into a bedroom because
[11:19.720 --> 11:25.640]  I don't have a clone of it. I don't have a copy of it. Now I've got that plant back in veg, and it
[11:25.640 --> 11:29.480]  has now crossed to a rise in seed form. Those seeds have been pulled out of that plant. That's
[11:29.480 --> 11:34.840]  some of the weird shit that I'm pulling. That plant reveged quickly. Not as quickly as the other
[11:34.840 --> 11:39.640]  one, but then the one that is nine weeks into flower and I decided to revege that, that one took
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.080]  a really long time. They revege at different stages, at different phases based on where they are.
[11:46.680 --> 11:50.680]  I need to catch up on my notes. Let me take a quick glance at the notes here. So they'll start
[11:50.680 --> 11:56.040]  making leaves. The leaves are going to look ugly and funky. Eventually those leaves will, more start,
[11:56.040 --> 12:02.200]  will start, more growth will start coming out. You will start getting actual shoots. Over time, those
[12:02.200 --> 12:06.360]  shoots will quit spinning. At first they're going to spin and they're going to look like claws and
[12:06.360 --> 12:10.440]  they're going to look like weird twisty leaves. The plants are going to freak out for a little bit.
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.320]  They're not supposed to do this. They were not, this was not supposed to happen. If this happened,
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.480]  if the plant survived this long outside, it would just die and fall apart. Nature would destroy it.
[12:19.480 --> 12:23.480]  It would have hermed out by now. It would have made a bunch of seeds, but we're not going to,
[12:23.480 --> 12:28.920]  don't worry about that. We're not going to hermit by doing this. That's a nature thing. So it's
[12:28.920 --> 12:32.600]  going to freak out. It's going to coil up. It's going to spin around. Eventually those leaves will
[12:32.600 --> 12:36.760]  begin to look like normal leaves. You'll see the difference. You'll say, Hey, there it goes. It's
[12:36.760 --> 12:40.840]  starting to do that. The top will come out and it'll peak out and those leaves won't look like
[12:40.840 --> 12:46.040]  shit. You'll go, Oh, it's doing it. Give it plenty of time for those shoots to stretch out. You want
[12:46.040 --> 12:51.400]  those to get, I like them about eight inches long with really good, healthy looking leaves at the
[12:51.400 --> 12:58.120]  top. This may take, like I said, 25 to 45 days. I've seen it take 60 days on some plants. So be
[12:58.120 --> 13:03.480]  very patient. Get those shoots to come out of the plant. Eventually they will correct and they'll
[13:03.480 --> 13:07.960]  start looking like you're growing clones out of the top of your buds. It'll look, you've got those
[13:07.960 --> 13:12.440]  branches coming up with five little thumb sized nuggets, maybe six thumb sized nuggets. Out of the
[13:12.440 --> 13:17.160]  top of that is a branch or a little shoot with perfect leaves. It looks like a little palm tree,
[13:17.160 --> 13:21.400]  a perfect little clone growing out of your buds. You will see it and you'll be very proud.
[13:23.160 --> 13:27.400]  That is what you're going to want to clone. That brand new shoot that's growing out,
[13:27.400 --> 13:33.560]  take a clone of that. I like to wait until I can see three or four of those happening and I will
[13:33.560 --> 13:39.400]  take half of them and I will clone half of them. When I take half of them, I'm mostly confident
[13:39.400 --> 13:43.960]  that my clones are going to root. But obviously I've got to re-veg for some reason. I probably
[13:43.960 --> 13:48.120]  fucked up the clones the first time or didn't think about it or something. So I'm going to clone half
[13:48.120 --> 13:52.440]  of them and I'm going to let that plant keep growing and let the other half keep going. Then
[13:52.440 --> 13:58.120]  I've got more backup clones over there in case shit happens again. I've got one more backup plan
[13:58.120 --> 14:00.920]  and if you don't get it that next time, then you're just shit out of luck. You were not meant
[14:00.920 --> 14:06.440]  to have that plant. So now I'm going to take the clones. I'm going to grow those clones out. I'm
[14:06.440 --> 14:12.520]  going to let them root. I'm going to let them get big enough to take clones from those. I don't want
[14:12.520 --> 14:17.880]  to flower out these plants that were re-veg. I want to take a clone off of them. I want them to
[14:17.880 --> 14:23.320]  make shoots and make more clones. I'll take a clone off of that, veg it out, let that one be my
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.280]  new flowering plant. I think by then the genetics and everybody are way back to normal. Nobody's in
[14:28.280 --> 14:33.160]  any shock. There's no more stress. It forgot all about that and it's just making plants like
[14:33.160 --> 14:37.800]  before. So it's going to make funky looking twisted leaves. Then it'll make normal shoots.
[14:37.800 --> 14:43.640]  We want to clone those normal shoots. Take that clone, pot it, let it grow until it is big enough
[14:43.640 --> 14:49.080]  to take clones. Take clones from that one. That is now your new donor plant. Take clones from that
[14:49.080 --> 14:54.760]  and flower out those clones. That is the way I think you should do a re-veg. I know that is a
[14:54.760 --> 15:02.360]  very simplified method of re-veg, but I have taught myself keep it simple stoner. Too many
[15:02.360 --> 15:07.560]  steps causes too many problems. Too many moving parts causes too many problems. So one of the main
[15:07.560 --> 15:14.280]  keys, one of the main tricks to speeding this up is to turn the lights back to 18-6 before you
[15:14.280 --> 15:19.240]  harvest. That will really speed this up. If you cannot do that, that's okay. You can still re-veg
[15:19.240 --> 15:23.880]  the day you harvest. Cut down those plants, clean up the room, get the part you don't need out of
[15:23.880 --> 15:29.800]  there, get the part you're going to harvest out, go trim it up, do your thing. Then put that plant
[15:29.800 --> 15:35.320]  back on 18-6. Put that room back on 24 hours a day if you can. Then get those plants back under a
[15:35.320 --> 15:41.160]  veg cycle. Start feeding them microbes and a good strong veg diet. I like to give them a lot of
[15:41.160 --> 15:46.920]  nitrogen and a lot of microbes. This will get them going back in a good vegetative phase. So they're
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.200]  going to start shooting out those shoots, get those clones, then just let them, let the clones veg.
[15:52.280 --> 15:58.200]  Then take clones of those. It is going to be a long, timely process, but it is worth it. Now here's
[15:58.200 --> 16:05.320]  something I really wanted to talk about in my experience. I recently re-vegged a plant that was
[16:05.320 --> 16:11.240]  fully flowered. So I had a plant that was filled with seeds and I decided to re-veg that plant. So
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.360]  it is filled with seeds, it is re-vegging, it's shooting fresh tops off of the main top, and a
[16:16.360 --> 16:21.160]  couple of fresh tops off of the bottom buds. There's a couple of freshies coming up there.
[16:21.160 --> 16:25.320]  What's happening is that top cola is getting more light, so it's going, I'll re-veg like a
[16:25.320 --> 16:29.560]  motherfucker up here where the light's super, super bright. Down a little lower, it's not getting as
[16:29.560 --> 16:34.360]  much light. It's not re-vegging as quickly. Let me make another note because there's something else
[16:34.360 --> 16:40.280]  I want to touch on that I didn't even write down. There we go. So those are vegging at the top
[16:40.280 --> 16:46.200]  really heavily. So I went and took a clone from that main top piece that was growing out. I've
[16:46.200 --> 16:50.360]  got a few backups down here, so if I kill this one up top, I know we got like four or five more
[16:50.360 --> 16:55.480]  clones down at the bottom. So I chopped that first clone out of the top, put it in the cloner,
[16:55.480 --> 16:59.800]  and waited a few days. And I keep checking for roots every few days because I've got that grower
[16:59.800 --> 17:05.880]  OCD. And then I keep looking at the plants where I took the clones from every day, and I'm noticing
[17:05.880 --> 17:13.480]  that since I took that clone out of that re-vegged plant, those lower fresh growth tops have started
[17:13.480 --> 17:21.000]  taking off. I have effectively done the same thing that we do when we top a plant before we
[17:21.000 --> 17:26.840]  flower it. I've taken out its main apical dominant top, and the plant is going, hey guys, there's not
[17:26.840 --> 17:31.640]  a top now. Somebody else gets to be the new king, and it's trying to reallocate all those hormones
[17:31.640 --> 17:35.640]  to the subsequent tops to make them the new dominant top. But they're all about the same
[17:35.640 --> 17:40.600]  height in the plant, so they're all growing evenly, and it really sped up the growth of the clones
[17:40.600 --> 17:46.680]  that I left behind in that re-veg process. So they're really taking off. So if you're struggling,
[17:46.680 --> 17:51.720]  if you can't get a couple of clones to pop up off of it as soon as, and don't go too early because
[17:51.720 --> 17:55.560]  that'll fuck you up, but as soon as you got one that's like eight inches long, six or eight inches
[17:55.560 --> 18:00.840]  long, you can get a good solid clone off of it. Take that main top one, and then the others will
[18:00.840 --> 18:06.280]  really start going more quickly. That is what I have noticed. So I've got a clone off of that
[18:06.280 --> 18:11.160]  plant that is filled with seeds. I'm going to take the main top off of the plant now, put that in a
[18:11.160 --> 18:16.200]  bin, and let it dry so that we can make seeds out of that, harvest those seeds. Then I will let the
[18:16.200 --> 18:20.440]  lower part of that plant continue to veg, and it's re-vegging and giving me more clones. I'll take
[18:20.440 --> 18:25.720]  those clones, and then I'll definitely have that genetic secured. Kind of regret letting that one
[18:25.720 --> 18:32.040]  almost slip away, but now I've secured a freshy clone of that cross. I'm not going to let you guys
[18:32.040 --> 18:35.960]  know what that is. Everybody's probably typing right now, what cross was this? What did you do
[18:35.960 --> 18:41.480]  this with? You also want to know what the one that I vegged, and then I vegged until it was about
[18:41.480 --> 18:45.400]  this big, and then we flowered it out. I said this big, and not everybody's watching on a video. It's
[18:45.400 --> 18:51.880]  about 18 inches, I think. I've flowered it out at 18 inches, let it go for 18 days, pollinated that
[18:51.880 --> 18:56.840]  bad bitch, let it rest for a day in the flower room, then put it back into a veg room, and it
[18:56.840 --> 19:02.600]  reverted to veg. I got a plant with seeds on the bottom and fresh growth on the top. It was amazing.
[19:02.920 --> 19:06.600]  Not a lot of people are going to get to see something like that in their lifetime. All right,
[19:06.600 --> 19:10.920]  I do have one more note that I want to talk about when it comes to revegging. I have noticed,
[19:11.800 --> 19:19.720]  this is just in my experience, that the plants underneath the LEDs were slower to reveg than the
[19:19.720 --> 19:29.160]  plants underneath an HPS light, but this is a but. The growth that came off of the LED lights
[19:29.160 --> 19:36.120]  looked healthier a little bit sooner. They reveged more quickly and more heartily under
[19:36.120 --> 19:41.000]  the LEDs or under the HPS. They were like, totally, let's do this, but they looked a little
[19:41.000 --> 19:47.160]  pale and a little spindly and a little weird. The ones under the LEDs took longer to show the
[19:47.160 --> 19:54.280]  progress of revege, but once they did it, they looked happier and less stressed out. That's just
[19:54.280 --> 20:00.280]  another thing that I observed. It happened more quickly under the HPS, but they looked less angry
[20:00.280 --> 20:07.160]  about it underneath the LEDs. That's just in my experience. That is what I saw. All right, you
[20:07.160 --> 20:12.360]  guys, this was a short, sweet episode. My throat is already starting to burn out. I want to apologize
[20:12.360 --> 20:16.120]  for coughing and fucking clearing my throat through this whole episode. Let's blame that on

[21:17.560 --> 21:22.040]  numbers. Since the quarantine and COVID situation happened, I've been getting a lot more views and
[21:22.040 --> 21:27.080]  follows on social media and all of my platforms. On Instagram, the live show has been going crazy.
[21:27.080 --> 21:31.720]  It is a very good time, in my opinion. I have a lot of fun. It feels like my audience, my viewers,
[21:31.720 --> 21:37.800]  my listeners have a good time too. I invite you, I encourage you to join me on Instagram Live
[21:37.800 --> 21:44.200]  every Monday at 7.10 PM-ish. It's pothead time, bro. Sometimes I got to race home and get there.
[21:44.200 --> 21:50.440]  Sometimes I'm doing shit. Every Monday at 7.10 PM-ish mountain time, I'm in Colorado. I know
[21:50.440 --> 21:54.840]  what time it is for me. I don't know what time it is where you are. If you're that way, it's an hour
[21:54.840 --> 21:59.160]  later or earlier. If you're that way, it's an hour later or maybe two hours later. Depends on where
[21:59.160 --> 22:04.280]  you are. Check your clocks. Do the math. Figure that out. I invite you to join me on Instagram
[22:04.280 --> 22:10.680]  Live every Monday about 7.10 PM mountain time. I hang out on Instagram. I take a couple of dabs.
[22:10.680 --> 22:15.800]  I get pretty blazed. Sometimes it's a good time. They usually cut me off after an hour. Last time
[22:15.800 --> 22:22.280]  they let me go for two full hours. That was a lot of fun. I hang out. I answer cannabis cultivation
[22:22.280 --> 22:27.080]  questions, cannabis culture questions. After a couple of dabs, you never know what could happen
[22:27.080 --> 22:31.880]  because people type things in randomly in the live chat and I just field questions in the chat,
[22:31.880 --> 22:37.000]  do my best to answer it. It's like a stump the grower or some shit and I do my best to answer
[22:37.000 --> 22:41.080]  all the questions on the fly. There's no preparation. There's no warning. People type crazy
[22:41.080 --> 22:46.040]  shit in the chat. I try to answer it right there. So join us. Instagram Live, all you have to do is
[22:46.040 --> 22:51.400]  log into Instagram. Wait for me to pop up around 7.10. If you follow me around 7.10 on a Monday,
[22:51.400 --> 22:55.880]  it'll show at the top of the screen. Rasta Jeff is live. I Read Genetics is live. Click on that.

[23:05.080 --> 23:09.640]  rant about Instagram Live. Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes,
[23:09.640 --> 23:13.800]  smokers and growers, clone cutters and pollen chuckers, seed hoarders and skateboarders,
[23:14.440 --> 23:18.280]  I want to thank all of you for joining me for this fun short episode. If you've got any more
[23:18.280 --> 23:22.600]  questions about Reveg, of course, I'd love to hear those. Until next time, I'm going to wrap it up
[23:22.600 --> 23:28.200]  because my throat is done. I want to give a giant shout out to my new friend, Eric Ross. Until next
[23:28.200 --> 23:31.880]  time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
