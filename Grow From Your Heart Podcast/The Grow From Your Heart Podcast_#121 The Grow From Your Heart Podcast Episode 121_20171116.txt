[00:18.620 --> 00:21.220]  Yeah, welcome back cannabis community.
[00:21.220 --> 00:24.740]  It's time for episode number 121 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[00:24.900 --> 00:29.620]  your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:29.620 --> 00:31.580]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:31.660 --> 00:33.780]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:34.140 --> 00:37.060]  if you're a cannabis activist or even someone who's just curious about the
[00:37.060 --> 00:41.980]  current state of cannabis, this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:41.980 --> 00:44.820]  My friends call me Ross DeJeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:45.140 --> 00:46.860]  As always, I want to send a huge thank you.
[00:46.860 --> 00:49.940]  Shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots band for letting me use their music
[00:49.940 --> 00:54.220]  on my show. Big shout out to Kat, Coop, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:55.620 --> 00:58.100]  I also want to give a huge shout out to my friends at Hitman Glass.
[00:58.380 --> 00:59.980]  Hitman Glass. When I buy a new rig,
[01:00.020 --> 01:02.700]  I like to buy something made in America by an American.
[01:02.940 --> 01:06.060]  And that's why I support Hitman Glass. If you're looking for a new piece,
[01:06.100 --> 01:10.820]  I recommend you check out www.hitmanglass.com and let them know you're
[01:10.820 --> 01:12.780]  listening to the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:13.020 --> 01:14.540]  And if you're in California this summer,
[01:14.740 --> 01:19.060]  make sure you support the Chalice Festival, the Chalice Festival, hash, music,
[01:19.220 --> 01:24.020]  glass, and art. I hope everybody's having a great week. You guys,
[01:24.020 --> 01:25.540]  this is a great episode. In my opinion,
[01:25.540 --> 01:29.180]  my good buddy Rob from Sour Seeds dropped by and we talk about selecting a male
[01:29.180 --> 01:30.900]  plant for breeding.
[01:31.060 --> 01:34.500]  So I'm going to let the music play for a couple of seconds. And when we come back,
[01:34.540 --> 01:37.460]  our good buddy Rob and I will be sitting at the table. Stay tuned.
[01:52.190 --> 01:53.710]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome back.
[01:53.870 --> 01:56.750]  I am back with our good friend Rob from Sour Seeds. How are you doing tonight, bro?
[01:56.750 --> 01:58.630]  How you doing, man? Thanks for having me. Oh dude. Thanks for coming.
[01:58.630 --> 02:01.110]  Taking some time out of your day. Always. We've been talking.
[02:01.110 --> 02:03.310]  We're both busy cats, dude. You got a lot of things on your head.
[02:03.310 --> 02:07.030]  I'm impressed. Too much. You looking forward to the Cannabis Cup? Absolutely.
[02:07.190 --> 02:10.590]  So this will be the first time we've spoke about this on the podcast.
[02:11.230 --> 02:14.830]  The Cannabis Cup that was planned for Denver over the 420 weekend,
[02:15.470 --> 02:18.430]  Denver said, no, they did not issue the permits that were needed.
[02:19.110 --> 02:22.790]  High Times response was to move the Cannabis Cup to Pueblo,
[02:22.830 --> 02:27.550]  Colorado. Woo. Yeah, that's where we are. That is our location.
[02:27.550 --> 02:31.310]  That is my town. That's where this podcast is recorded. So the podcast,
[02:31.310 --> 02:33.350]  no matter where the podcast lands in Pueblo,
[02:33.390 --> 02:36.750]  it will be 20 minutes from my house at maximum. That's it.
[02:36.790 --> 02:37.910]  I'm pretty stoked on that.
[02:37.910 --> 02:39.870]  We're going to have a whole bunch of cool people around here.
[02:39.870 --> 02:42.310]  We're going to have a whole bunch of cool shit to do. Uh,
[02:42.350 --> 02:45.950]  I'm hoping to get a whole bunch of cool people on the podcast since it's nearby.
[02:45.950 --> 02:48.150]  They can either come here and record in the, uh,
[02:48.190 --> 02:52.750]  kitchen slash studio podcast setup, or I've got a portable unit. We'll take, uh,
[02:53.030 --> 02:55.590]  hopefully we get a whole bunch of cool folks. Don't be afraid to come. You guys,
[02:56.030 --> 02:59.470]  a lot of people seem to be talking shit on Facebook about Pueblo, Colorado.
[03:01.910 --> 03:04.990]  All the people that are talking shit have never been here. Well, that's it.
[03:04.990 --> 03:07.790]  And I'm from Florida and I love it here. So that tells you something right there.
[03:07.870 --> 03:12.710]  Yeah. It's I landed here because of research. There you go. That's even worse.
[03:12.710 --> 03:15.470]  I landed here because of research. And when I got here, I visited Denver.
[03:15.470 --> 03:19.270]  I didn't, I visited Springs. I've been in, I went in South Walsenberg.
[03:19.670 --> 03:22.630]  I've been all over for being here a short amount of time in three years.
[03:22.670 --> 03:25.150]  And, uh, I really love public Colorado. It's a nice humble town.
[03:25.150 --> 03:27.470]  You get to know the people here. They'll take care of you. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:27.710 --> 03:31.750]  Denver's too expensive. Springs is a kind of a military vibe.
[03:31.870 --> 03:35.270]  I think is a high crime too. Okay. Yeah. I've been, uh,
[03:35.310 --> 03:39.190]  I work in Springs now and I see a lot of wonky shit on my brakes. Honestly,
[03:39.190 --> 03:42.390]  I see some strange shit. I just watched the crazy ass local news, man.
[03:42.430 --> 03:44.910]  And it's always going down in Springs. Yeah. Yeah.
[03:44.910 --> 03:48.350]  Well there are a couple of parts of Pueblo that I would not go to, but, uh,
[03:48.350 --> 03:51.030]  for most, for the most part, this place is not that bad. You guys.
[03:51.030 --> 03:52.990]  So come hang out at the cannabis cup, have a good time.
[03:53.150 --> 03:56.310]  Sour seeds should have a booth out there. You know, I'll be running around.
[03:56.310 --> 03:59.070]  I don't have a booth. I will not do a booth this year. Uh,
[03:59.110 --> 04:01.310]  I'll have an I read genetics t-shirt on. I'll be running around,
[04:01.310 --> 04:04.070]  having a good time. That's a long ways away, but we're stoked about it.
[04:04.070 --> 04:07.550]  The cannabis cup is coming to Pueblo, Colorado. Uh, don't be afraid.
[04:07.590 --> 04:10.270]  Come see us. Absolutely. It's going to be a lot of fun guys. I guess.
[04:10.270 --> 04:12.430]  So we're going to do a little show about breeding cannabis.
[04:12.430 --> 04:16.030]  We want to do a show about selecting a male plant. Sorry.
[04:16.030 --> 04:18.630]  We're both coughing over here. I'm taking some dabs, Rob smoking a joint.
[04:18.670 --> 04:22.350]  What strain are you smoking on bro? Probably some, uh, Tutton common,
[04:22.590 --> 04:25.870]  the King Tut. It tastes good. It smells, it smells kind of a,
[04:25.990 --> 04:28.350]  it's got a unique smell, very unique smell.
[04:28.350 --> 04:30.030]  I don't even know how to describe that. Uh,
[04:30.470 --> 04:32.670]  it almost reminded me of a specific turpenoid.
[04:32.710 --> 04:35.110]  I can't remember which one we decided it smelled like anymore.
[04:35.710 --> 04:36.550]  Started with an L.
[04:37.510 --> 04:40.710]  Linna Lule. Linna Lule. Linna Lule. Thank you for the heads up there.
[04:40.710 --> 04:42.350]  I can never remember the name of Linna Lule.
[04:42.350 --> 04:44.910]  It's always the one that I forget that herb tends,
[04:44.910 --> 04:47.510]  smells like it's got a lot of Linna Lule in it. Anyway,
[04:47.910 --> 04:49.230]  we're choking over here cause we're getting high.
[04:49.230 --> 04:54.150]  I'm smoking some Turpex sour death star wax, a shout out to the Turpex crew.
[04:54.430 --> 04:57.590]  All right, we're going to do a podcast about selecting a male plant for
[04:57.590 --> 05:00.590]  breeding. Uh, if you're, if you're trying to breed some seeds,
[05:00.990 --> 05:03.190]  there are a few things to look for in a male plant.
[05:03.710 --> 05:05.790]  So let's say you buy yourself a 10 pack.
[05:06.270 --> 05:09.350]  I would do it to 10 packs if you're trying to do a phenol hunt to find a male,
[05:09.350 --> 05:12.230]  but not everybody's got the room. Try to do at least two 10 packs.
[05:12.230 --> 05:15.230]  There's power in numbers. When you're hunting, the more plants, the better.
[05:15.270 --> 05:17.390]  I agree. 20 to 50 is a good number. Right.
[05:17.430 --> 05:22.030]  You can usually find super plants in 20 to 50 just astounding keepers that
[05:22.030 --> 05:25.710]  stand out. Yeah. And if you can't do that many at a time, just do them in phases.
[05:25.750 --> 05:30.750]  Do 10 find a keeper out of that 10 do 10 more find the best out of those two or
[05:30.870 --> 05:33.910]  the yeah, out of those 10 and then you got two to stack up against each other.
[05:34.150 --> 05:36.910]  Keep doing it until your room is full and then start eliminating shit.
[05:37.190 --> 05:40.270]  That's right. I even sometimes, uh, I do it from seeds right out of the gate.
[05:40.430 --> 05:42.030]  You can kind of tell, you know,
[05:42.030 --> 05:44.110]  you have those seeds that just look like they're going to have a hard time.
[05:44.270 --> 05:46.470]  They're going to struggle and you can tell whenever they open the shell,
[05:46.470 --> 05:50.030]  they have the little tiny leaves or sometimes are mutated or doesn't look as
[05:50.030 --> 05:52.790]  strong or vibrant as the others. I just go ahead and chuck them right out.
[05:52.790 --> 05:55.550]  I don't get rid of it as a, as a breeder, as somebody who is,
[05:56.150 --> 05:58.750]  I've read a lot of plants. And if you were looking for a male plant,
[05:58.750 --> 06:02.150]  you're going to have to learn to get rid of some plants and not be too attached
[06:02.150 --> 06:05.190]  to your babies. Be ruthless. Yes. Be ruthless. These are not humans.
[06:05.190 --> 06:08.390]  These are little baby plants and you are creating the future of cannabis.
[06:08.510 --> 06:10.790]  If you do not pull those ugly little fuckers,
[06:10.790 --> 06:15.750]  you are going to ruin and fuck up and you're going to retard the progression of
[06:15.750 --> 06:18.830]  cannabis. That's exactly it. You're going to water the genetics down. Yes,
[06:18.830 --> 06:21.590]  you are. And we don't want to do that. We're breeding to improve the genetics.
[06:21.590 --> 06:24.030]  So if you have a plant, you start a bunch of seeds,
[06:24.270 --> 06:25.910]  you got a couple that are kind of wonky looking.
[06:25.910 --> 06:28.510]  You got one with the fucked up leaf. Don't be afraid to get rid of it.
[06:28.870 --> 06:31.830]  That's right. As they grow, keep a good eye on them. Um,
[06:32.390 --> 06:33.790]  so before we get to that part,
[06:33.830 --> 06:37.990]  let's talk about what the male plant is going to bring to our breeding project.
[06:37.990 --> 06:41.870]  When we hit a male plant with pollen to a female plant that accepts pollen that
[06:41.870 --> 06:43.470]  has pistols, uh,
[06:43.990 --> 06:48.150]  it's going to create seeds that are going to have traits of both plants.
[06:48.550 --> 06:51.990]  What is the male mostly going to bring to the table here?
[06:52.390 --> 06:55.230]  I feel like it's going to bring a lot of the, uh,
[06:55.270 --> 06:58.990]  pest resistance and a lot of the vigor and a lot of the shape.
[06:59.350 --> 07:02.430]  That's it. That's a really a lot of what it is, the hybrid vigor.
[07:02.510 --> 07:04.590]  And without that male side of the family,
[07:04.590 --> 07:07.710]  you really can't catch that true hard vigor like that.
[07:08.310 --> 07:12.150]  Um, I always tell people all the time, you know, you can't create, you know,
[07:12.150 --> 07:14.390]  Halle Berry's by eliminating half the gene pool.
[07:17.790 --> 07:20.790]  I like the way you put that people will catch on there. All right. So yeah,
[07:20.790 --> 07:24.270]  we need the male to bring that good structure and the resistance.
[07:24.590 --> 07:27.310]  I think a lot of the flavor comes from mama. It comes from the girl.
[07:27.630 --> 07:29.590]  So when you're looking for structure and shape,
[07:29.590 --> 07:31.390]  a lot of it is going to come from the boy.
[07:31.790 --> 07:34.390]  So now we can talk a little bit about, uh,
[07:34.390 --> 07:39.110]  what to look for in a male plant. Uh, I keep saying the structure. Uh,
[07:39.110 --> 07:41.710]  I like a male plant. If you're breeding a sativa,
[07:41.830 --> 07:43.630]  you're going to want one that gets a little bit taller.
[07:43.830 --> 07:46.550]  The males are always going to, when you're, when you're in veg,
[07:46.710 --> 07:49.070]  the males are always going to start taking off a little taller.
[07:49.430 --> 07:53.190]  Their goal is to get above the females so that when they pollinate their pollen
[07:53.190 --> 07:57.070]  falls down onto the girls. So that's a good hint when they're growing in veg,
[07:57.310 --> 08:00.590]  look for that one that's taken off. That might be a boy for you. Absolutely.
[08:01.030 --> 08:02.910]  So you're looking for, if you've got a sativa,
[08:03.270 --> 08:07.310]  you want the one that keeps not too tall and doesn't take off too much.
[08:07.310 --> 08:10.350]  Cause you don't want to make your progeny skyrocket immediately,
[08:10.670 --> 08:12.790]  but you want to find the one that's the right shape of,
[08:13.070 --> 08:16.150]  you almost want to find what you want your girls to look like.
[08:16.230 --> 08:19.950]  You want the boy to look the shape to be what you want your females to look like
[08:19.950 --> 08:23.270]  is what I think I'm trying to say. So find, look for that. Uh,
[08:23.270 --> 08:25.150]  you want tight close node spacing.
[08:25.150 --> 08:27.950]  You don't want a whole bunch of gaps in between your branches. Uh,
[08:27.950 --> 08:31.470]  I don't like it when a plant spits out really long branches like Tahoe.
[08:31.590 --> 08:33.830]  I was going to say the OGs, that was about to come right out of my mouth.
[08:33.870 --> 08:36.830]  The OG family, the whole family over there on that side,
[08:36.830 --> 08:39.270]  even grape stomper OG and some of the other ones that are hybrids.
[08:39.270 --> 08:41.590]  Most of them take off because of the boys. Like you're saying,
[08:41.590 --> 08:44.470]  the structure it comes from the male is a perfect example. Joseph,
[08:44.510 --> 08:48.590]  the Joseph male, the gauge uses everything. They cross that great male, by the way,
[08:49.310 --> 08:51.830]  but it comes out tall.
[08:51.830 --> 08:54.990]  A lot of the times you get mostly dominant phenotypes of stretchy plants because
[08:54.990 --> 08:58.150]  of that stretchy, stretchy with little popcorn balls coming off everywhere.
[08:58.710 --> 09:01.310]  It's a dominant OG male. And that's, that's what's going on there.
[09:01.350 --> 09:04.030]  It's that structure taken over the dominance from that male plant.
[09:04.310 --> 09:07.630]  And it's the OG dominance. And that OG is always,
[09:07.670 --> 09:10.310]  the cushions have always had had that, that dominance.
[09:10.310 --> 09:13.030]  And it really is an Afghan heritage. It's just, it's trace back.
[09:13.030 --> 09:15.830]  It's recessive Afghan genes that are really strong and they're always going to
[09:15.830 --> 09:16.750]  come forward and breed true.
[09:16.750 --> 09:19.910]  Unless you find a dominant gene from a different side of the family that breeds
[09:19.910 --> 09:22.950]  just as hard, like something from blue dream, for example,
[09:23.510 --> 09:26.750]  good example of a good breeding parent or white widow used to be a really good
[09:26.750 --> 09:27.470]  breeding parent.
[09:27.470 --> 09:30.430]  I've bred the white widow with two other strains and it does very well.
[09:30.430 --> 09:33.550]  That's exactly it. And that's what you're doing at that time.
[09:33.550 --> 09:38.230]  You're taking a diversity of genotypes from different parts of the world,
[09:38.350 --> 09:40.430]  Brazil, South America, things like that.
[09:40.430 --> 09:44.150]  And then diversifying them against things like OG coaches,
[09:44.150 --> 09:47.630]  which are originally derivative Afghan places like that.
[09:47.670 --> 09:50.830]  Then mostly purged into California, East coast places with coastlines.
[09:51.670 --> 09:53.150]  And then out.
[09:53.550 --> 09:58.470]  Out a lot of the stuff that started off in the Dutch genetics has those real thin
[09:58.510 --> 10:00.830]  leaves. Cause it was all bred for indoor cultivation.
[10:00.870 --> 10:05.110]  That's a lot of Brazilian and sativa genetics and then Nepal and things like
[10:05.110 --> 10:09.270]  that. And Nepalese genetics, Moroccan genetics. You see a lot of Spain,
[10:09.870 --> 10:13.710]  a lot of Spanish genetics. That's that's where you see an influx of that.
[10:13.710 --> 10:14.550]  In Netherlands.
[10:14.870 --> 10:16.550]  So I want to give a shout out to gauge green genetics.
[10:16.550 --> 10:18.710]  Since we were talking about the grape stomper OG there,
[10:19.150 --> 10:22.070]  those guys finally took home a cannabis cup for the grape stomper.
[10:22.350 --> 10:25.750]  Good work guys. Nothing but love and respect for you. Gauge green, uh,
[10:26.110 --> 10:29.230]  M four K MK four and keep play the whole crew.
[10:29.230 --> 10:32.310]  They kind of helped me get a little start in the cannabis industry. So much,
[10:32.350 --> 10:35.230]  much love, much respect, shout out for that. So yeah,
[10:35.230 --> 10:37.430]  look for something that doesn't get too tall, too crazy.
[10:37.430 --> 10:39.990]  If you're looking for an Indica, if you're trying to breed an Indica male,
[10:40.270 --> 10:44.790]  find the shortest stoutest squatiest one you can find probably with those big
[10:44.910 --> 10:49.390]  fattest leaves, you can find, uh, the, the, what, there's dinner plate leaves.
[10:49.590 --> 10:51.150]  If you can camp out under those leaves,
[10:51.150 --> 10:53.070]  if you could almost make a hammock under those leaves,
[10:53.390 --> 10:56.550]  that'd be a sweet male to breed with. If you're looking for a nice Indica plant.
[10:57.150 --> 11:00.430]  So you want something with nice, nice, tight, close node spacing.
[11:00.870 --> 11:03.870]  So if you can find a male plant, you got to flower them out. You guys,
[11:03.870 --> 11:06.630]  so you got to fetch them out. Uh, start looking for note,
[11:06.630 --> 11:09.710]  their structure in veg, watch what they do. You don't have to get them too tall.
[11:09.910 --> 11:13.710]  Take a clone off of them, label the clone that matches the,
[11:13.710 --> 11:17.910]  so clone a to plant a clone B to plant B flower, your plants out.
[11:18.790 --> 11:21.310]  Uh, see what they do. If you've got females and you're looking for males,
[11:21.310 --> 11:23.750]  you can just go ahead and toss the females or you can finish them out and have
[11:23.750 --> 11:24.590]  some buds.
[11:24.670 --> 11:28.230]  I will take my male plants and flower them all the way out to see what they do
[11:28.230 --> 11:31.270]  all the way to like seven, eight, maybe nine weeks into flower.
[11:31.630 --> 11:33.510]  I want to see if they're going to produce trichomes.
[11:33.510 --> 11:36.230]  I want to see if they're going to produce a whole bunch of pollen.
[11:36.470 --> 11:37.510]  I want to see if they're just barely,
[11:37.510 --> 11:41.230]  some plants will only produce a little bit of pollen as a breeder.
[11:41.230 --> 11:44.870]  You can see which pollen will be. So there's kind of grainy pollen.
[11:44.870 --> 11:48.270]  I don't feel like that pollen's worth a shit. Uh, it's the pre pollen.
[11:48.270 --> 11:51.110]  It's the pollen before your plants actually start busting out.
[11:51.430 --> 11:53.990]  That real grainy, dusty shit. I don't think that is good.
[11:53.990 --> 11:56.670]  You want to let that, if you're going to collect pollen, let that fall,
[11:56.910 --> 11:59.790]  let that get away and then collect that. Like, uh,
[11:59.830 --> 12:03.070]  it's about 14 days into the pollinate pollination.
[12:03.110 --> 12:05.670]  That's about 10 to 14 days into when they bust open.
[12:05.670 --> 12:08.710]  That's when the really good pollen starts coming out. It's a little softer,
[12:09.030 --> 12:12.630]  a little smoother to the touch plants, fully maturing into flower at that point.
[12:13.230 --> 12:15.310]  Hormones are going in overdrive. He's doing it.
[12:15.350 --> 12:20.230]  He's spraying all over those plants. He's letting them go. Yeah. So, uh,
[12:20.230 --> 12:23.910]  if your plant is producing trichomes and a whole bunch of resin and has the
[12:23.910 --> 12:26.390]  perfect structure, you want to breed with that. Uh,
[12:26.390 --> 12:29.350]  I like to rub the stem and smell the stem of my plants.
[12:29.350 --> 12:33.030]  One of my favorite things. Uh, if it smells like puke, it's a good thing.
[12:33.070 --> 12:36.110]  It's a good thing. All those plants. When you, for some reason, when it's,
[12:36.110 --> 12:40.510]  it's got a hint of bar trash can and vomit, that's a good male.
[12:42.150 --> 12:44.590]  To me, that's it. A lot of that, when you smell that stem, and if you,
[12:44.590 --> 12:46.470]  if the male, you can go across the board and say,
[12:46.470 --> 12:49.750]  you have a bunch in a row from your, your phenome hunt that you're doing,
[12:49.750 --> 12:53.030]  put them all next to each other, sit down, smell each one of them side by side,
[12:53.030 --> 12:54.510]  make sure you're cleaning your hands each time.
[12:54.550 --> 12:56.990]  So you get a really good profile of what each one's doing.
[12:56.990 --> 13:00.470]  And usually the one that stinks the worst is the best one to use typically.
[13:00.470 --> 13:04.150]  And then you judge, narrow it down by smell and then narrow it down by structure,
[13:04.150 --> 13:06.990]  site, use all your senses. Don't, don't eliminate anything, you know,
[13:07.350 --> 13:10.750]  feel free to take a leaf and snap one off and taste the stem a little bit.
[13:10.750 --> 13:12.270]  If it's sour and tart tea and stuff,
[13:12.270 --> 13:14.510]  a lot of the times and you're using hardly no nutrients at all.
[13:14.510 --> 13:17.390]  It's a good thing. It's telling you, I got a lot of terpenes.
[13:17.630 --> 13:18.830]  I got a lot to add to the table.
[13:19.590 --> 13:22.950]  And they're definitely, the male is definitely going to contribute to the flavor.
[13:23.270 --> 13:27.110]  I think the mama definitely over overwhelms the flavor category,
[13:27.110 --> 13:30.590]  but the male is going to contribute to the amount of flavor.
[13:30.750 --> 13:33.070]  Well, let's say you want, you know, you don't want to just use any old male.
[13:33.070 --> 13:36.630]  You want to use the best one. You can't at any, any, any and all costs, you know?
[13:36.630 --> 13:39.910]  So, so if you know, that's just one of those things that we look for, I think.
[13:40.550 --> 13:44.390]  Yeah. So, so how much, so if you best a 10 pack of seeds, you'll probably find,
[13:44.390 --> 13:46.990]  you know, maybe five males, hopefully, you know, five females,
[13:46.990 --> 13:49.550]  five males you're going to toss two of those right away.
[13:49.590 --> 13:52.070]  One of them is going to be funky. One of them is going to be a run.
[13:52.070 --> 13:53.710]  So those go away. Now you got three.
[13:54.910 --> 13:58.150]  I think that I never use, no, I,
[13:58.430 --> 14:02.550]  I personally know that I never used that first plant to show me male flowers.
[14:02.830 --> 14:05.190]  I don't like to take that first one. He's too dominant.
[14:05.190 --> 14:08.110]  I feel like he's going to do too much to my breeding. He's going to,
[14:08.310 --> 14:11.710]  all the plants are going to look like that one. If I've got three of them,
[14:12.110 --> 14:15.990]  I kind of would lean toward the third one to flower. If I've got five,
[14:15.990 --> 14:17.630]  if I had five males that worked well,
[14:17.630 --> 14:20.150]  probably that third or fourth one would be the one that I would use.
[14:20.150 --> 14:23.830]  I wouldn't go right for that first one that busted out because it's too obvious.
[14:23.870 --> 14:26.750]  Me, I always choose it. Honestly, I, when I'm doing my breeding,
[14:26.750 --> 14:30.470]  I always choose it on like, like based on what the mother's doing,
[14:30.470 --> 14:32.830]  what I'm trying to do. If I'm trying to say like,
[14:32.830 --> 14:36.510]  if I'm out crossing like a blue dream or a sativa or something close to it,
[14:36.510 --> 14:37.710]  it has a longer flowering time.
[14:37.710 --> 14:40.310]  And I want to come in with an Indica and actually shorten his flowering time.
[14:40.310 --> 14:44.750]  Then that's when I would choose a male that it's bust out first,
[14:44.750 --> 14:46.790]  because I want to take that flowering time and cut it down.
[14:46.790 --> 14:49.750]  Really cut it down with that dominant male. That's perfect.
[14:49.750 --> 14:53.710]  Thank you. But, but if, if, if say you have a little Indica dominant,
[14:53.710 --> 14:57.350]  but you want to make it a true hybrid and you want to make it go a little bit
[14:57.350 --> 15:00.230]  longer in the garden, say more, if it's a seven, eight week,
[15:00.230 --> 15:02.110]  and you want it to go more like eight, nine,
[15:02.110 --> 15:04.350]  maybe tennis or something like that, then that's, you know,
[15:04.350 --> 15:07.670]  another reason you'd go with a longer flowering male, same, same,
[15:07.670 --> 15:08.950]  same instance, just vice versa.
[15:09.350 --> 15:12.190]  And don't be afraid to have plants that flower for a long time. You guys,
[15:12.350 --> 15:15.630]  I know nine, 10 and 11 weeks sounds like scary flowering times,
[15:15.630 --> 15:17.750]  but I flowered plants for 14 and 15 weeks.
[15:17.750 --> 15:20.550]  And what happens is amazing once they get that right.
[15:20.550 --> 15:24.830]  And that's far in sour diesel is a good example of that going that long 10,
[15:24.830 --> 15:27.270]  11 weeks on it, but it's well worth it in the end. I mean,
[15:27.270 --> 15:30.550]  you're getting a connoisseur product that you can't gain anywhere else in the
[15:30.550 --> 15:33.630]  test results to show you the rest for, and the harvest weights come through.
[15:33.710 --> 15:34.910]  It makes it well worth it.
[15:35.190 --> 15:38.830]  I had an African land race that didn't have a name and it grew colas.
[15:39.110 --> 15:42.110]  I cut it down in week 14 and the colas were bigger than my legs.
[15:42.270 --> 15:44.790]  I think, I think it's the biggest complication with all growers. Um,
[15:44.950 --> 15:47.750]  young to old is patience. Yeah.
[15:47.750 --> 15:50.830]  I think it's the hardest thing we all have to overcome just in life.
[15:50.870 --> 15:53.990]  That's it in general. That's it. All right. I got to take a drink.
[15:54.350 --> 15:56.430]  I'm about to choke and then we're going to keep this moving.
[16:02.600 --> 16:03.960]  All right. I'll edit that part out.
[16:05.920 --> 16:08.960]  I was going to beat box. Oh man, you should have, that would have been fresh.
[16:09.240 --> 16:12.000]  I might not even edit it now since you're beat box and I might just leave that
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.960]  part right there. All right. Um, what else do you want to add to that, bro?
[16:16.960 --> 16:19.560]  You got anything you want to add to, to talking about selecting a male?
[16:19.720 --> 16:22.080]  We pretty much covered it. I mean, use all your senses, you know,
[16:22.080 --> 16:26.240]  and breed for a purpose that that's the biggest thing breed for purpose.
[16:26.240 --> 16:30.160]  I can't stress that enough for purpose all because if it's good and you want to
[16:30.520 --> 16:32.720]  bang it together with something else, it just looks good.
[16:32.760 --> 16:35.520]  Just don't do it just because to do it or don't do it because you've got a cool
[16:35.520 --> 16:38.440]  name lined up, do it, do it for purpose, do it for purpose.
[16:38.440 --> 16:41.200]  We see too much of that in the industry every day that you gotta, you know,
[16:41.760 --> 16:43.800]  create the strain, come up with the name. Lastly.
[16:43.960 --> 16:47.880]  Yes. And if you do make something and it sucks. Okay. So
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.880]  let's say you make a strain, you take whatever,
[16:51.880 --> 16:54.200]  you've got this male and then you've got this prized female.
[16:54.400 --> 16:58.400]  You throw pollen all over it. You let it go. Uh, so once you pollinate,
[16:58.640 --> 17:00.000]  it's going to take you, you know,
[17:00.360 --> 17:02.120]  about six more weeks until the seeds are ready.
[17:02.120 --> 17:04.960]  Maybe six or eight more weeks before we can chop that plant down. Uh,
[17:04.960 --> 17:07.640]  I let the plants dry until they're crispy. At that point,
[17:07.640 --> 17:09.320]  I just chop them down and let them get super crispy.
[17:09.320 --> 17:10.840]  And then I just rub them and the seeds fall out.
[17:10.840 --> 17:12.680]  And then I go and collect all the seeds. Uh,
[17:12.720 --> 17:15.040]  and then I blast the material into oil, honestly.
[17:15.440 --> 17:17.680]  But so then you got to grow those seeds yourself.
[17:18.040 --> 17:19.720]  I would recommend you grow a hundred of them.
[17:19.760 --> 17:23.240]  Just at least germinate a hundred of them right away and see what they do.
[17:23.640 --> 17:27.160]  Before you give any of them away to anybody, germinate a hundred of them,
[17:27.440 --> 17:32.200]  veg out at least 50 and flower, at least 25 of them, dry them, cure them,
[17:32.200 --> 17:36.880]  smoke them, see what they do. If it sucks, flush the seeds down the toilet,
[17:36.880 --> 17:38.480]  get rid of them, feed them to your bird.
[17:38.480 --> 17:40.360]  So that stuff happens. We're all human. We all,
[17:40.360 --> 17:44.000]  we all make mistakes and you can only control what you're doing so much.
[17:44.200 --> 17:46.240]  But it's not, it's nature. I wouldn't say nature.
[17:46.240 --> 17:48.440]  You can only control so much of what you're doing.
[17:48.440 --> 17:49.840]  The rest is left in her hands.
[17:49.880 --> 17:52.080]  Yeah. And sometimes things just don't want to breed together.
[17:52.080 --> 17:53.720]  I made a strain that totally sucked.
[17:53.720 --> 17:57.200]  It produced giant colas that tasted amazing,
[17:57.240 --> 17:59.160]  but it would not get you high at all.
[17:59.560 --> 18:02.960]  You can smoke the entire crop and news no high at all.
[18:03.480 --> 18:05.720]  Yeah. I'm guilty of that.
[18:06.440 --> 18:07.280]  Yeah.
[18:07.720 --> 18:10.360]  My, my main thing was a breeding. Um,
[18:10.400 --> 18:12.760]  we had one recently that came out was a Dante's Inferno.
[18:13.520 --> 18:15.680]  It was a big hit for a lot of people. Cause a lot of people do,
[18:15.680 --> 18:17.240]  there are connoisseurs smokers out there that like,
[18:17.520 --> 18:19.160]  like growing things like Grin spoon and other,
[18:19.160 --> 18:23.240]  the other other strains out there that are just absolutely 100% top grade
[18:23.240 --> 18:26.960]  connoisseur weed that yield like crap, you know, Girl Scout cookies. I mean,
[18:27.120 --> 18:29.000]  it does, it's not a known for its yield.
[18:29.000 --> 18:30.640]  It's known for its power and its flavor.
[18:30.680 --> 18:32.560]  And that peppery sweet funk taste.
[18:32.640 --> 18:35.640]  Well, that's it. And then, and you're not growing that as a cash crop, you know,
[18:36.200 --> 18:38.680]  a lot of the times you're growing that for personal. And if you do,
[18:38.680 --> 18:42.120]  you are growing it for cash crop. You have a lot of room in a lot of lights.
[18:43.440 --> 18:44.520]  But you could be there somewhere.
[18:45.520 --> 18:46.600]  You know, warehouse style.
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.600]  Oh, what were we even talking about to get us up males? But anyway, um,
[18:51.640 --> 18:53.320]  I did have something I wanted to add to the, uh,
[18:53.320 --> 18:56.600]  I also terpenes breeding for terps. Um,
[18:57.040 --> 18:59.120]  one of our perfect ones is coming up now.
[18:59.120 --> 19:01.800]  It's going to be one of our big front runners is the S one version of our
[19:01.800 --> 19:06.920]  blueberry fuel. Um, this cut has amazing terpenes. It's off the hand.
[19:06.960 --> 19:09.960]  It's just often, it's hard to explain. It's really, really hard to explain.
[19:10.000 --> 19:11.560]  It's, it's got a little bit of everything in it.
[19:11.560 --> 19:16.080]  And the reason that is is because when you're choosing males and females and
[19:16.080 --> 19:17.360]  you're doing that breeding work, you know,
[19:17.360 --> 19:19.520]  actually look at their terpene profile. If you don't know,
[19:19.520 --> 19:23.240]  and you can get it tested, spend the 40, 50, 75 bucks, whatever it takes,
[19:23.280 --> 19:26.080]  get it tested. Then you have paperwork to back your stuff up.
[19:26.120 --> 19:28.520]  If you're in a legal state, you should be able to get your stuff tested.
[19:28.520 --> 19:30.520]  And the more widely it's becoming nowadays,
[19:30.520 --> 19:33.080]  you have literally half the country now we're 50, 50,
[19:33.080 --> 19:36.040]  and it's taken over and you should be able to get it tested by someone,
[19:36.040 --> 19:39.000]  somehow, somewhere. Forums, you know,
[19:39.080 --> 19:42.920]  use your connections to reach out and then get it done, you know,
[19:42.960 --> 19:44.680]  and it makes a big difference. I mean,
[19:44.680 --> 19:47.760]  you can find out like a terpene profile and then try to match it up with
[19:47.760 --> 19:51.920]  something that absolutely would compliment those terpenes,
[19:51.920 --> 19:55.640]  but doesn't have them like our blueberry fuel. You have Blue Dream,
[19:55.680 --> 19:59.240]  which is a good clone only, good breeding parent, breeds true, it breeds solid.
[19:59.680 --> 20:03.120]  It's known to breed stable. I bred a couple of good strains with it. You know,
[20:03.160 --> 20:04.520]  you can pop a hundred,
[20:04.520 --> 20:08.320]  200 seeds and you might get one or two Hermes out of it just because it breeds
[20:08.360 --> 20:12.000]  that stable and it usually takes the dominance of things.
[20:12.040 --> 20:16.160]  But when you breed it with something like OGs and diesels and things like that,
[20:16.160 --> 20:19.520]  you add a whole different terpene profile that really compliments the blueberry
[20:19.520 --> 20:22.400]  muffiney hues and the blend and the creaminess of the Blue Dream.
[20:22.680 --> 20:25.000]  It just stands out and it creates a whole nother animal.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.400]  And then you don't even, most people when you smuggle with them first,
[20:28.400 --> 20:31.000]  tell them what it is lastly. They didn't never even would have guessed.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.040]  It came from Blue Dream. That's the thing.
[20:33.040 --> 20:36.400]  They look at it never would have thought and taste it never would have thought.
[20:36.840 --> 20:40.680]  And it just peels them back. It's got, you know, diesels, it's got OG tones,
[20:40.680 --> 20:43.560]  it's got blueberry tones, it's got creamy tones in it. And it just,
[20:44.520 --> 20:46.280]  it's off the hook, man. That's all I can say.
[20:46.960 --> 20:48.360]  I think I've smoked some of that with you before.
[20:48.360 --> 20:51.400]  I think you brought that last time and it was definitely a tasty strain if that
[20:51.400 --> 20:52.760]  was what you brought for me to smoke.
[20:53.800 --> 20:55.880]  So I've noticed everything I breed to the Blue Dream.
[20:56.040 --> 20:57.680]  I've never used it as a male, obviously,
[20:57.680 --> 21:00.720]  cause it's a clone only and it's a girl, but everything I've bred to it,
[21:00.960 --> 21:03.920]  it has made huge colas. Everything you put to it.
[21:03.960 --> 21:05.440]  That's it. That's it too. That's why I love,
[21:05.760 --> 21:09.400]  that's why we did the OG cross on it typically was to actually gain a little bit
[21:09.400 --> 21:13.000]  of extra yield. Yeah. Because OGs are lanky and stuff.
[21:13.040 --> 21:14.200]  I was trying to put more, uh,
[21:14.280 --> 21:17.400]  I bred Grateful Dog to the Blue Dream and I call it the Blue Healer.
[21:17.680 --> 21:20.960]  And my point was to put more vigor to the Grateful Dog.
[21:20.960 --> 21:22.800]  Just make it a little bit bigger, a little chunkier,
[21:23.080 --> 21:27.760]  but I'm not a fan of the flavor of Blue Dream that, uh, it's a girl,
[21:27.760 --> 21:30.760]  it's girl weed. It tastes like stripper weed. It is. It's real.
[21:30.840 --> 21:34.240]  It's kind of like a bland blueberry. It's real muffin-y and real creamy.
[21:34.240 --> 21:36.880]  It's like, uh, it tastes like Jiffy Muffin smell.
[21:37.640 --> 21:39.840]  That's like in the oven when you get the Jiffy Muffins,
[21:39.840 --> 21:41.960]  you put the blueberry muffins in and it kind of has that aroma.
[21:41.960 --> 21:45.720]  Blueberry muffin-y blueberry air freshener instead of blueberry candies.
[21:46.240 --> 21:50.120]  Or like that blueberry marker. Yeah. Oh man. I miss that.
[21:50.240 --> 21:53.760]  Smell the markers in class. He just gave me a weird flashback, but yeah, yeah.
[21:54.280 --> 21:55.320]  And I'm not a fan of that.
[21:55.320 --> 21:59.320]  So I put that to the Grateful Dog and it made it more pungent and more, uh,
[21:59.320 --> 22:02.040]  more piney. And then it brought out a bottom layer of fruit.
[22:03.040 --> 22:07.320]  I bred it to the, uh, King Kim Cross the Grape Stomper OG and we call it the,
[22:07.320 --> 22:10.520]  uh, the, well, it's the Blue Stomper, but, uh,
[22:10.600 --> 22:13.400]  that one made it much stinkier and that the, uh,
[22:13.440 --> 22:17.000]  King Kim Grape Stomper OG made little tiny popcorns and now it makes spears
[22:17.000 --> 22:18.880]  since we put it to the Blue Dream. Yeah.
[22:19.040 --> 22:21.560]  This is what I tell people all the time. You know, I've know you've had it.
[22:21.640 --> 22:25.160]  I know it's been around for a long time, held 15 years now, but, uh,
[22:25.180 --> 22:27.440]  don't count it out as a breeding mother with hybrids. You know,
[22:27.440 --> 22:30.160]  don't see Blue Dream on the label and automatically turn it away because you're
[22:30.160 --> 22:32.640]  probably passing up a really, really good cross.
[22:32.800 --> 22:36.240]  I know a lot of people that do not like Blue Dream at all. Shout out to those guys.
[22:36.240 --> 22:38.120]  They know who they are. I'm not going to say your names on the show.
[22:38.160 --> 22:40.680]  What up boys? I know a lot of the nightmare lines,
[22:40.680 --> 22:42.280]  people fell in love with and things like that.
[22:42.280 --> 22:45.400]  The reason why they called it nightmare where you think nightmare dream, I mean,
[22:45.400 --> 22:50.040]  I put two and two together. People didn't even know. Yeah.
[22:50.080 --> 22:53.080]  Then you tell them like, no, there's no Blue Dream in there. All right.
[22:53.160 --> 22:55.400]  So something important I should mention, this is a,
[22:55.800 --> 22:59.200]  this is kind of a breeding by eye technique here.
[22:59.360 --> 23:02.800]  You could make elliott charts. You could take a whole bunch of notes.
[23:02.800 --> 23:05.360]  You should take a whole bunch, a whole bunch of notes either way,
[23:05.600 --> 23:09.400]  but this is kind of just a breeding, a breeding with love grow from your heart,
[23:09.400 --> 23:13.400]  sort of a do it by your eye, old school sort of thing.
[23:13.400 --> 23:18.280]  We're breeding with a lot of experience here. So I think if you find a good male,
[23:18.600 --> 23:21.400]  you're going to want to do a Fino hunt of at least 20 seeds.
[23:21.440 --> 23:24.480]  You're going to want to find one with a good structure. You want it to look,
[23:24.760 --> 23:28.640]  you want it to have the shape that you want the babies to have. Um,
[23:28.760 --> 23:32.440]  find one that makes resin. If you can find one that makes a whole bunch of
[23:32.440 --> 23:35.120]  pollen, if it doesn't make enough pollen, you're not going to make enough seeds.
[23:35.520 --> 23:40.000]  Uh, find one with real close node spacing. Find one that smells real good.
[23:40.480 --> 23:44.560]  Try not to select the very first one that goes into flower and shows you that
[23:44.560 --> 23:45.400]  it's a boy.
[23:45.600 --> 23:50.040]  Definitely do not use any male plants that show any sign of hermaphrodism.
[23:50.080 --> 23:54.200]  Male plants can hermaphrodite also. You'll see pollen sacks.
[23:54.200 --> 23:57.600]  You'll see little male sex popping out and then right out of the sides,
[23:57.600 --> 24:01.480]  you'll see female pistols come out. Yeah, it's not. Those aren't nut hairs.
[24:02.320 --> 24:03.680]  That's a hermaphroditic plant.
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.920]  You got to cut fucking Bruce Jenner down and get rid of it. Yeah,
[24:07.920 --> 24:12.600]  I just said that I ain't afraid. You got to get Bruce Jenner out of there.
[24:12.600 --> 24:15.040]  We ain't trying to have no, none of that shit in the grow room.
[24:15.040 --> 24:18.000]  You got to get rid of it. That will create lots of problems in the future.
[24:18.240 --> 24:21.480]  You do not want to breed hermaphrodism into your plants. That's right.
[24:21.800 --> 24:25.000]  That is not a good, that's, that's the exact opposite of what we're aiming for.
[24:25.520 --> 24:28.680]  So, um, yeah. And then pay attention to that pollen, you guys.
[24:28.880 --> 24:30.280]  And when the pollen does start spitting,
[24:30.280 --> 24:32.960]  you don't want that first grainy Sandy pollen. You want that.
[24:33.160 --> 24:33.920]  The pollen will,
[24:33.920 --> 24:36.200]  when you catch some of it and put it in your hand and rub it in the palm of your
[24:36.200 --> 24:39.360]  hand, it'll feel smooth and silky. It'll feel real nice.
[24:39.920 --> 24:43.040]  And then when you leave the grow room, you're gonna have to hose yourself down,
[24:43.040 --> 24:46.000]  get a mister, uh, like a sprayer and spray,
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.840]  like a pump sprayer, like you'd almost use to pump pesticides.
[24:48.840 --> 24:52.320]  Get one of those and just spray yourself down and wash your hands because tap
[24:52.320 --> 24:55.160]  water works really great as chlorine. It's safe for everything. Plants,
[24:55.160 --> 24:56.240]  animals, people, there you go.
[24:56.240 --> 24:58.520]  That'll deactivate any pollen that you've got on you.
[24:58.520 --> 25:02.080]  And then if you are going from that pollen room into a room that has female
[25:02.080 --> 25:04.680]  plants, you can always hose them down as you walk in,
[25:04.680 --> 25:08.000]  just hit them with the sprayer and they won't receive pollen for a little while.
[25:08.240 --> 25:10.560]  Just try to prevent that pollen from getting onto your females.
[25:10.600 --> 25:11.720]  If you don't want to breed,
[25:12.240 --> 25:15.880]  because if you have a male plant in the house or in the room or in the facility
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.720]  with your females, it's going to try to get pollen everywhere.
[25:20.920 --> 25:23.520]  One thing I've noticed, but you could tell me if you've recognized this,
[25:23.920 --> 25:25.720]  I've got separate breeding rooms.
[25:25.720 --> 25:29.520]  I've got an upstairs and a downstairs area and an area over here and an area
[25:29.520 --> 25:29.880]  over here.
[25:29.880 --> 25:33.720]  And then I've got a male in one area and females in a totally different area.
[25:34.120 --> 25:38.120]  I've noticed when I've got girls and a flowering male in the same house,
[25:38.120 --> 25:41.440]  the girls get a little stickier and they flower a little more quickly.
[25:41.920 --> 25:45.480]  Do you think those girls know there's a male around somewhere?
[25:45.640 --> 25:47.200]  Good question. That is a good question.
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.800]  It goes into some of my forte lighting and it actually, yeah, they do.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.280]  They know because of infrared lighting. Okay.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  Plants use infrared lighting to see around them.
[25:57.080 --> 25:59.080]  That's why you have natural spacing in the woods.
[25:59.760 --> 26:01.800]  That is why trees naturally space themselves out,
[26:01.800 --> 26:04.160]  naturally weed out smaller ones below them and around them.
[26:04.160 --> 26:07.120]  And you typically go into the woods and new pine tree forests and things like
[26:07.120 --> 26:11.000]  that. And they have an equal spacing between trees. They do. That is why.
[26:11.360 --> 26:14.760]  Okay. So infrared lighting, my horny, my horny girl plants know there's
[26:14.760 --> 26:18.960]  studs upstairs blowing as low. They know she's like, I want some of that.
[26:19.400 --> 26:23.280]  There's pheromones I believe as well. Okay. I would believe that because, well,
[26:23.280 --> 26:26.400]  they can take in CO2 and they can, they breathe out carbon dioxide, you know,
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.640]  there's always a constant intake between oxygen and carbon dioxide battling back
[26:31.200 --> 26:35.640]  and forth, back and forth. Right. And, and, and a lot of it, their annual plants.
[26:35.640 --> 26:38.280]  So they built over thousands and millions of years beyond the surf.
[26:38.280 --> 26:41.800]  They have built defense mechanisms to try to breed. That is their purpose.
[26:41.840 --> 26:43.320]  That's why they're hermaphrodite on us.
[26:43.320 --> 26:45.720]  When we talk to anybody remembers the first Jurassic park,
[26:45.760 --> 26:48.040]  how the guy used to say nature will always find a way.
[26:48.040 --> 26:49.480]  And then you all of a sudden you have eggs.
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.680]  That is why because nature will always find a way.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.920]  And you're talking about something that is on a total different level than what
[26:55.920 --> 26:59.280]  you think. It's mind boggling to think how, you know,
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.720]  an evolution sense, how far ahead some plants are, then, then what we are,
[27:04.760 --> 27:06.920]  you know, we, we tend to think we are the Kings of the world. You know,
[27:06.920 --> 27:08.880]  we're the center of the universe every day, week.
[27:08.920 --> 27:13.520]  But really if you look at an ant, if he was our size, you could lift your house.
[27:13.920 --> 27:17.120]  Right. Yeah. They can lift like 500 times their natural weight.
[27:17.120 --> 27:19.560]  That's right. And then a smile at you with one arm, holding your house,
[27:24.040 --> 27:25.440]  because that's really what it is. You know,
[27:25.440 --> 27:27.680]  it's really more about perception than anything.
[27:27.680 --> 27:29.600]  You just fucked with all the listeners, heads and others,
[27:29.680 --> 27:32.840]  visualizing an ant lifting up my house and running away with it while we're in
[27:32.840 --> 27:37.040]  a recording. But, but it is in reality, when you put it that way, I mean,
[27:37.040 --> 27:40.320]  it's how you perceive things. It's pretty, it's pretty wild, man.
[27:40.720 --> 27:44.320]  It's wild universe out there. Yeah. The whole plant's mission is to survive.
[27:44.680 --> 27:47.360]  All right. So, um, man, you got anything else?
[27:47.360 --> 27:48.680]  So you want to add to this podcast?
[27:48.680 --> 27:50.400]  It sounds like we've covered selecting a male.
[27:50.400 --> 27:51.760]  I hope that made a lot of sense to you guys.
[27:51.760 --> 27:55.120]  I just want everybody to show up and, uh, show Denver, uh,
[27:55.240 --> 27:59.080]  that, uh, we can do this better than they can. I really do. I think,
[27:59.080 --> 28:01.840]  I think the people of Pueblo are going to show them that we've held the,
[28:01.840 --> 28:05.960]  we've, we've held the, what does the, uh, state fair here for how long? And,
[28:05.960 --> 28:10.160]  uh, somebody we know actually made a good point on social media that, uh,
[28:10.680 --> 28:14.080]  it's, uh, 11 days long, 25,000 people a day. Yeah.
[28:14.120 --> 28:16.440]  If anybody can do a Pueblo County can do it right.
[28:16.440 --> 28:20.280]  We can host that many folks. We got enough hotels, eating places. That's it.
[28:20.360 --> 28:22.680]  You guys, I actually plan to put together a podcast.
[28:22.720 --> 28:24.080]  I posted it up to social media,
[28:24.080 --> 28:26.000]  asking my local friends for a little bit of help.
[28:26.320 --> 28:29.160]  I'm going to put a podcast together and be a little bit of a tour guide for
[28:29.160 --> 28:32.360]  you. I'm going to find places for you to stay places for you to eat things for
[28:32.360 --> 28:33.760]  you to do. Um,
[28:34.280 --> 28:37.280]  it gives you a little bit of information about our town so that, uh,
[28:37.280 --> 28:38.440]  when you come here, you're prepared.
[28:38.880 --> 28:41.960]  And then we can all have a good time and take a bunch of dabs and be friends.
[28:41.960 --> 28:43.960]  And you'll have a good time with us. It's going to be a blast.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.240]  It's going to be such a blast.
[28:45.320 --> 28:47.760]  I'm proud to be here, man. That's all I can say.
[28:47.760 --> 28:49.680]  I'm proud to have landed in this spot.
[28:49.680 --> 28:51.800]  Then all of a sudden they know we're holding the greatest party in the world.
[28:51.960 --> 28:54.760]  A lot of people talk a lot of trash, but look what's about to happen here.
[28:55.680 --> 28:59.520]  The biggest cannabis event on the planet is going to be here in our backyard.
[28:59.720 --> 29:00.920]  I think it's going to be a blast, man.
[29:01.040 --> 29:03.520]  I know it's going to be a blast cause I have fun everywhere I go.
[29:04.040 --> 29:06.160]  Yeah. You're going to be there and I'm going to be there.
[29:06.240 --> 29:09.320]  Jesse and Spencer are going to be there. What else do we need, bro?
[29:09.320 --> 29:11.640]  We're going to have a good ass time. Spencer competing this year.
[29:11.800 --> 29:15.280]  I can't speak for Spencer. Okay. Well shout out to garden weed, man.
[29:16.280 --> 29:17.600]  What's up buddy. I hope you're listening to this.
[29:17.600 --> 29:20.040]  Shout out to Maddie and the whole garden of weed and crew and Spence and the
[29:20.040 --> 29:21.960]  doggies. What up? So rock boy, what's up Nana?
[29:22.680 --> 29:23.920]  I hope everybody's doing well over there.
[29:23.960 --> 29:27.760]  We just gave shout outs to dogs on the podcast. That's pretty rad. All right.

[30:09.840 --> 30:13.880]  Yankee needs to talk to you, but make sure you guys check out the dank team.com.
[30:13.880 --> 30:15.480]  Let them know that we sent you a,
[30:15.480 --> 30:18.320]  there's a little bit of IRI genetic stuff available. Go check that out.
[30:18.320 --> 30:21.480]  There's some black cherry chem available up there. It's just damn good by the
[30:21.480 --> 30:22.560]  way. Well, thank you. Thank you.
[30:22.560 --> 30:24.280]  We grew some over at green and healthy wellness.
[30:24.280 --> 30:27.280]  It'll be on the shelves by the time this podcast comes out. Uh,
[30:27.320 --> 30:28.680]  very likely be gone.
[30:28.800 --> 30:32.040]  It's made some of the best concentrates I've had in Colorado, dude. Honestly.
[30:32.040 --> 30:33.160]  I mean, I'd say top five.
[30:34.840 --> 30:38.040]  Thank you. Just the flavors off. You can taste the cherry. You can taste the chem.
[30:38.080 --> 30:40.080]  I really liked it. That black cherry comes through.
[30:40.080 --> 30:43.080]  Like my two favorite, you know, two, two favorite terms.
[30:43.640 --> 30:47.040]  That's why shit happens, brother. See, that's how breeding happens.
[30:47.040 --> 30:50.440]  You see two strains and a breeder that's bred as many times as we have,
[30:50.640 --> 30:53.840]  you can see what it's going to do. You're like, Oh, if I put that to that,
[30:53.840 --> 30:57.200]  it's like becoming a chef. It's like a weird chef almost. A lot of it. Yeah.
[30:58.080 --> 31:00.840]  It's an art. There is some artistry involved in it and we're not, don't,
[31:00.840 --> 31:03.960]  don't ever let us think that we're taking that away. It's not just pure science.
[31:03.960 --> 31:07.240]  There's art to all of it. Extractions growing, breeding, especially.
[31:07.720 --> 31:10.880]  Absolutely. It takes, it takes a good eye and a little bit of heart.
[31:10.880 --> 31:11.800]  You're going to listen to the plants.
[31:11.800 --> 31:13.680]  You got to lay down next to them and listen to them.
[31:14.080 --> 31:16.600]  You got to feel the vibe from the plants and help you out.
[31:17.120 --> 31:20.240]  Well, bro, thank you for coming out. Thank you for rolling some joints and smoking
[31:20.240 --> 31:22.760]  down. Yeah. I'll hit that sucker again. You looked at me like you want to hit this.

[31:24.720 --> 31:27.160]  you guys fill your head with thoughts while I fill my head with smoke.
[31:30.480 --> 31:32.520]  There you go. People think I don't smoke a lot of flour,
[31:32.520 --> 31:34.920]  but I've been smoking a lot of flour lately.
[31:36.560 --> 31:38.600]  Yeah. Yeah. It was me. I'm guilty of that.
[31:38.720 --> 31:41.400]  That's why I didn't just allow those ones passing Bogart and over here. I'm sorry.
[31:41.600 --> 31:45.560]  Oh no, man. It's that's how it is. We're not the, once you get to that level,
[31:45.560 --> 31:47.360]  you just hold onto a joint for a few minutes and smoke it.
[31:47.360 --> 31:49.960]  These are my new cigarettes and I'll smoke it for a few. Oh yeah.
[31:49.960 --> 31:53.520]  Well congrats on not smoking cigarettes. 21 years clean, sober do it guys.
[31:53.840 --> 31:57.040]  How long have you not had a cigarette now? Almost two months.
[31:57.120 --> 31:59.160]  Almost two months. We mentioned that you had a, uh,
[31:59.480 --> 32:02.480]  a problem one night on the show and we didn't talk too much about it.
[32:02.480 --> 32:05.160]  I just said that you're planning on coming, but you had a little issue. Yeah.
[32:05.160 --> 32:08.960]  Yeah. Um, I'll be honest. It's from smoking cigarettes. Uh, you smoke too much.
