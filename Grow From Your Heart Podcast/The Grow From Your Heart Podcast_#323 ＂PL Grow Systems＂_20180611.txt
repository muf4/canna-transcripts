[00:00.960 --> 00:03.200]  Welcome back cannabis community.
[00:03.200 --> 00:06.360]  It's time for episode 323 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:06.680 --> 00:10.720]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:10.720 --> 00:12.720]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:12.880 --> 00:16.480]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:16.520 --> 00:19.240]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:19.640 --> 00:23.120]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host.
[00:23.200 --> 00:25.920]  My friends call me Ross DeGeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:26.600 --> 00:29.640]  This episode of the podcast is brought to you by my friends at the Hella Dank
[00:29.880 --> 00:32.040]  Seed Company. If you need new seeds for your garden,
[00:32.280 --> 00:34.480]  look no further than the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:34.480 --> 00:37.400]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:38.080 --> 00:41.360]  This episode of the podcast is also brought to you by my friends at PL Grow
[00:41.360 --> 00:42.200]  Systems.
[00:42.520 --> 00:45.600]  A responsible gardener knows what's happening in his grow room at all times,
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.280]  and you can monitor your temperature and your humidity from anywhere with the
[00:49.300 --> 00:52.040]  new Minder unit from our friends at PL Grow Systems.
[00:52.080 --> 00:56.400]  You can find them at PLGrow.Systems. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:57.040 --> 00:59.880]  this is a very special Thursday episode of the podcast.
[00:59.920 --> 01:04.160]  I've got my friends Peter and Lee from P&L Grow Systems joining me on Skype,
[01:04.360 --> 01:06.720]  and we're going to talk about the PL Grow Systems units.
[01:07.240 --> 01:08.800]  And then we're going to get a little bit chatty.
[01:09.200 --> 01:12.240]  There were a couple of moments I had to edit because Skype was getting choppy,
[01:12.520 --> 01:14.960]  but for the most part, I think the show sounds pretty good.
[01:15.120 --> 01:18.200]  So ladies and gentlemen, let's get right to it. Live on Skype.
[01:18.280 --> 01:21.720]  Here are my friends, Peter and Lee from P&L Grow Systems.
[01:23.920 --> 01:25.920]  Well, gentlemen, welcome. I have pressed record.
[01:25.920 --> 01:28.720]  I've got you guys on the show. So welcome to the show.
[01:28.800 --> 01:31.840]  Peter and Lee from P&L Grow Systems. Thanks for joining me guys.
[01:35.000 --> 01:38.400]  So can you tell us exactly where you guys are from? Because when I first met you,
[01:38.440 --> 01:41.280]  I advertised that you were from Australia and I've been corrected.
[01:44.870 --> 01:48.470]  Yeah. Especially seeing as I'm originally from South Africa,
[01:48.510 --> 01:51.550]  being linked with Australia. Fair enough.
[01:52.190 --> 01:55.750]  Sort of right hemisphere, wrong country, but I'm originally from South Africa.
[01:56.470 --> 01:57.550]  Living in England,
[01:58.830 --> 02:02.510]  been here for 20 plus years for my sins.
[02:03.470 --> 02:05.710]  And I'm originally from the home of Durban Poison.
[02:11.050 --> 02:13.770]  And I'm in London. I've been here for a good 10 years now.
[02:15.570 --> 02:16.410]  Love the city.
[02:17.530 --> 02:19.690]  I've heard a lot of great things, but I have never been.
[02:21.210 --> 02:22.890]  Worth a visit. Definitely worth a visit.
[02:23.410 --> 02:25.690]  Well now I've got somewhere to stay. So I'll come see you guys.
[02:27.570 --> 02:28.410]  Absolutely.
[02:28.850 --> 02:30.250]  All right. So of course you guys are.
[02:30.250 --> 02:31.490]  I'll be here to stay when we head that way.
[02:31.810 --> 02:34.050]  Absolutely. You have got space. Well,
[02:34.050 --> 02:37.290]  obviously Peter and Lee are P&L from P&L Grow Systems.
[02:37.690 --> 02:42.170]  Would you guys like to take a minute and tell me about how you got into this
[02:42.170 --> 02:45.250]  idea of creating the P&L Grow Systems products?
[02:46.890 --> 02:49.970]  Did I lose you? Something may have gone wrong.
[02:51.850 --> 02:53.290]  Okay. So I think where I was,
[02:54.130 --> 02:57.650]  I was just going to give you guys an opportunity to tell me about the company,
[02:57.650 --> 03:00.250]  since you guys are obviously Peter and Lee of P&L Grow Systems.
[03:00.610 --> 03:03.610]  Would you like to tell me a little bit about how P&L came about and what
[03:03.770 --> 03:05.690]  inspired you to create this company?
[03:07.650 --> 03:08.490]  Yeah, sure.
[03:09.250 --> 03:13.290]  Well, it started off with us both having the same problem that if you wanted to
[03:13.290 --> 03:14.850]  take a two week holiday,
[03:15.330 --> 03:19.450]  you'd come back to a bunch of dead plants either in your greenhouse or your
[03:19.450 --> 03:20.290]  grow space.
[03:21.970 --> 03:26.970]  And really we went and had a look in the market to go and see what was out there
[03:27.010 --> 03:30.210]  that would allow us to keep an eye on it and remotely control it.
[03:30.610 --> 03:34.450]  And there was nothing within our price bracket, that's for sure.
[03:36.250 --> 03:39.450]  You know, there's some really expensive bits of kit out there that can do it for
[03:39.450 --> 03:40.290]  you.
[03:40.290 --> 03:45.290]  And whether you can even remote into them is optional and usually would require
[03:46.090 --> 03:50.530]  quite a bit of reconfiguring your home or your routers and firewalls to let
[03:50.530 --> 03:51.370]  traffic in.
[03:51.570 --> 03:55.090]  So being technologists,
[03:56.370 --> 03:59.370]  we just decided like there's got to be a cheaper way and easier way of doing this
[03:59.370 --> 04:01.130]  and started building systems for ourselves.
[04:02.210 --> 04:07.090]  We started off with some early prototypes that when we started posting pictures
[04:07.090 --> 04:07.930]  of them,
[04:08.050 --> 04:13.050]  people took interest and it was after slowly building it up and showing what it
[04:13.250 --> 04:15.450]  could do and controlling our own setup,
[04:16.970 --> 04:19.330]  that interest grew and grew and grew. And we suddenly realized, hang on, you know,
[04:19.330 --> 04:21.690]  we've solved the problem for ourselves,
[04:22.090 --> 04:27.090]  this ability to make it really easy to get up and running and be able to access
[04:27.330 --> 04:31.490]  it from anywhere in the world. And other people are interested in it.
[04:31.490 --> 04:34.330]  And to be honest, that's really how the company came about.
[04:35.290 --> 04:39.490]  We solved the problem and realized that there were others that wanted the same
[04:39.490 --> 04:40.970]  solution at an affordable price.
[04:41.210 --> 04:45.170]  The one thing about it was the remote access and making it easy to set up.
[04:46.210 --> 04:51.210]  And we've both got decades of IT support
[04:51.650 --> 04:53.570]  within the financial world.
[04:55.330 --> 04:59.290]  So trying to make this thing as easy as possible to reduce the number of support
[04:59.290 --> 05:00.130]  calls.
[05:00.730 --> 05:04.250]  I've made the fatal mistake of offering my father IT support in the past.
[05:04.250 --> 05:04.690]  And so yeah,
[05:04.690 --> 05:08.770]  trying to make things as simple as possible to keep the number of calls to a
[05:08.770 --> 05:13.090]  minimum is part of what we try to do.
[05:13.650 --> 05:15.250]  If it's not simple,
[05:15.570 --> 05:18.690]  then we realize it's going to be a problem for a lot of people. You know,
[05:18.690 --> 05:20.370]  not everybody is a techie.
[05:20.730 --> 05:21.970]  That is absolutely the truth.
[05:21.970 --> 05:25.930]  So that's key to what we do. I mean, our devices, you literally,
[05:26.130 --> 05:28.290]  you connect them to your wifi network. That's it.
[05:28.290 --> 05:30.370]  You don't have to configure anything else.
[05:30.610 --> 05:33.050]  Everything happens super simply through the website.
[05:33.050 --> 05:35.410]  That's one of my favorite parts about it is the simplicity.
[05:35.850 --> 05:38.890]  And also that I didn't have to add anything to my computer system.
[05:39.370 --> 05:41.050]  Everything I need is happening for me.
[05:42.730 --> 05:43.330]  Yeah.
[05:43.330 --> 05:44.170]  The best part.
[05:44.170 --> 05:45.650]  And then you can access it from anywhere in the world.
[05:45.690 --> 05:46.010]  Yes.
[05:46.010 --> 05:49.770]  That's my favorite part that I can see my grow at home while I am at work.
[05:49.770 --> 05:53.450]  I don't have to drive home and check on anything. It is completely simple.
[05:53.650 --> 05:56.970]  That's my favorite part is that I don't have to come here to look at the plants.
[05:56.970 --> 05:59.650]  I could just check right on the phone. I can look at the cameras on one app.
[05:59.930 --> 06:02.890]  I can look at the minder on the other app and I know everything is safe.
[06:03.050 --> 06:05.210]  That's my favorite part. And the simplicity,
[06:06.010 --> 06:09.410]  the other units I've tried to use, I've had problems and this one,
[06:09.490 --> 06:12.290]  I plugged it in and it works. So I think that is amazing.
[06:14.250 --> 06:18.290]  Yeah. And then we've tried to keep it nice and modular as well. So, you know,
[06:18.290 --> 06:21.810]  the first unit that we've brought out is the one with the sensors with does
[06:21.810 --> 06:25.090]  ambient temperature and humidity and another temperature sensor that's
[06:25.090 --> 06:28.330]  waterproof that you can drop into your, your reservoir for instance,
[06:28.330 --> 06:30.330]  or you can put it into your grow medium.
[06:31.170 --> 06:33.930]  I was using it out in the greenhouse to check that the soil temperature was up
[06:33.930 --> 06:37.170]  to the right temperature before planting the chilies in the greenhouse
[06:38.770 --> 06:43.770]  to prevent root shock for instance. And then because it's modular and,
[06:44.410 --> 06:44.650]  you know,
[06:44.650 --> 06:48.170]  you tend to find that most people's just one temperature and humidity.
[06:48.170 --> 06:49.930]  CO2 is a nice to have,
[06:49.930 --> 06:54.290]  but only really if you're running in a sealed environment and your average home
[06:54.970 --> 06:59.530]  enthusiast and home grower is not necessarily doing CO2 enriched environments.
[07:00.970 --> 07:03.850]  So we can, well, we are, we do have a CO2 sensor coming out.
[07:03.850 --> 07:07.450]  That is another modular piece that you just add in. It's not,
[07:07.930 --> 07:09.410]  you don't have to change anything on your setup.
[07:09.450 --> 07:13.290]  You don't have to buy a whole new piece of kit to do this. Well,
[07:13.330 --> 07:14.170]  we just need to buy the sensor,
[07:14.170 --> 07:17.170]  but you don't have to upgrade anything software wise or anything like that.
[07:17.530 --> 07:20.930]  Which is great for people who just want to add something later.
[07:20.930 --> 07:23.370]  So if maybe they can't afford the system right at the beginning,
[07:23.410 --> 07:26.610]  they can add on instead of having to invest in the high price unit right away.
[07:26.650 --> 07:28.330]  So that's a great, a great addition there.
[07:29.330 --> 07:30.170]  Build it up slowly.
[07:30.730 --> 07:33.730]  Is there to make it as accessible to everybody as possible really?
[07:34.010 --> 07:37.530]  Is there a vapor pressure deficit reading available?
[07:38.850 --> 07:43.810]  Yeah. I mean, we do that as a calculation. We, uh, so on the, on the website,
[07:44.610 --> 07:46.850]  um, one of the outputs that you get,
[07:46.850 --> 07:51.130]  which is calculated on the fly is the VPD readings. Excellent. Uh,
[07:51.210 --> 07:53.970]  and that you can then look at for free,
[07:53.970 --> 07:57.010]  what we give to everybody that comes with each unit. When you buy it,
[07:57.290 --> 08:01.210]  you get free access to your current readings. Um,
[08:01.250 --> 08:05.810]  and then two hours, four hours, six, 12, 24, 48,
[08:05.810 --> 08:09.010]  and seven days worth of historical data charted.
[08:09.010 --> 08:13.130]  So you can look at over time what's actually going on in the environment.
[08:14.250 --> 08:16.210]  Um, and we take a reading every 30 seconds.
[08:16.210 --> 08:19.210]  So it's fairly granular as to what's going on in the environment.
[08:19.210 --> 08:21.370]  You can see if somebody has opened the door and closed it again,
[08:21.770 --> 08:23.690]  because you'll see temperature spikes up and down.
[08:23.730 --> 08:26.370]  You can see when the fan came on. If you pay enough attention,
[08:26.370 --> 08:28.090]  you can see when each fan kicks on.
[08:29.850 --> 08:33.570]  I we've had a number of clients who've actually said that being able to see
[08:33.570 --> 08:37.610]  that has one of them identified that the fan had sucked some plastic up
[08:38.370 --> 08:41.010]  because they knew the fan was supposed to be on and they couldn't see the
[08:41.010 --> 08:44.850]  temperature drop. So they went to see what was wrong with the fan. Um,
[08:45.250 --> 08:48.730]  and others have realized, Oh, hang on. I haven't turned the heater on. Yes.
[08:48.730 --> 08:50.450]  They can see when the heater was supposed to kick in.
[08:50.450 --> 08:53.090]  Suddenly they don't see the temperature actually coming up.
[08:53.170 --> 08:54.930]  I actually had an air conditioning.
[08:55.690 --> 08:58.090]  Oh, I had an air conditioner. I had an air conditioner fail.
[08:58.130 --> 09:00.090]  And I would not have known without the minder unit.
[09:00.130 --> 09:02.890]  I checked to see what the temp was and it was really high in there.
[09:02.930 --> 09:06.410]  So I knew something's wrong. I need to get over there. And if I hadn't looked,
[09:06.690 --> 09:09.970]  I wasn't coming home from work for another four or five hours and four or five
[09:09.970 --> 09:12.130]  hours at that temperature, I would have not had a crop.
[09:12.330 --> 09:14.650]  So it was worth the investment already.
[09:16.170 --> 09:19.290]  Exactly. And I mean, and that's something that people don't re I mean, you know,
[09:19.290 --> 09:23.650]  when we come onto sort of the whole environment control and monitoring of the
[09:23.650 --> 09:27.290]  environment, we listen to lots of podcasts and they often talk about all the
[09:27.290 --> 09:30.970]  nutrients and the lighting and all of that, which is all good and well,
[09:30.970 --> 09:34.970]  but if the environment is off, it doesn't matter how good the lighting is,
[09:35.050 --> 09:38.970]  how good the nutrients are. Um, if it's, you know,
[09:39.490 --> 09:43.290]  45 degrees centigrade and 10% humidity, everything's dead. Absolutely.
[09:44.570 --> 09:49.010]  Unless you're growing cacti. It's not surviving that.
[09:49.410 --> 09:54.410]  And the problem with your run of the mill hygrometer is that it gives you the
[09:55.050 --> 09:56.970]  maximum temperature that it was at.
[09:56.970 --> 10:01.050]  And the minimum temperature was at with no indication as to how long you were at
[10:01.050 --> 10:03.490]  the maximum and the minimum temperature. Was it just a blip?
[10:04.010 --> 10:07.930]  Were you there for 10 minutes or was it four hours? Um,
[10:08.730 --> 10:13.730]  and so that's the extra information that we provide and it gives people that real
[10:14.290 --> 10:16.610]  insight into what's actually going on.
[10:17.210 --> 10:21.330]  I've noticed that most of the swings happen right when the lights go on or right
[10:21.330 --> 10:24.930]  when the lights go off within the next hour is when things really go different
[10:25.170 --> 10:26.730]  and you're never there for that time.
[10:26.730 --> 10:29.530]  You don't know what's happening in that grow room when those lights go off for
[10:29.530 --> 10:33.130]  that hour. It's really neat to find out what happens with your lights,
[10:33.210 --> 10:37.250]  your temperature, your humidity, your vapor pressure deficit in that hour swing.
[10:37.290 --> 10:39.570]  That's the most interesting part in my opinion.
[10:39.890 --> 10:42.730]  So it's really neat to get something like this and be able to chart what's
[10:42.770 --> 10:43.610]  happening.
[10:44.490 --> 10:49.490]  And then you can start to do things like plan to actually have fans come on 15
[10:49.610 --> 10:53.730]  minutes before the lights come on to sort of reduce that bump as the lights kick
[10:53.970 --> 10:58.890]  in and give everything an opportunity to start up before the lights come on.
[10:59.250 --> 11:00.450]  And the same with the lights go off.
[11:00.450 --> 11:03.170]  You can actually stop things extracting 10 minutes before if you're running in a
[11:03.170 --> 11:06.530]  really small space where if it carries on extracting,
[11:08.290 --> 11:11.730]  after the lights have gone off, it cools down too quickly. So you might say,
[11:11.730 --> 11:13.570]  well before just before the lights turn off,
[11:13.610 --> 11:15.410]  turn the fans off and we'll stop extracting.
[11:15.410 --> 11:19.530]  And then just that general sort of ambient cooling that happens can reduce that
[11:19.530 --> 11:20.370]  drop off.
[11:21.370 --> 11:23.850]  So you've already mentioned several ways that these things are going to improve
[11:23.850 --> 11:25.850]  our gardens. I've already mentioned one great way.
[11:26.250 --> 11:29.530]  I bet getting into the States has been a huge jump for you guys.
[11:31.850 --> 11:32.850]  Well, precisely. I mean,
[11:32.850 --> 11:37.410]  that's where we see there being a really big market and that's,
[11:37.530 --> 11:39.330]  you know, it's not kidding ourselves. You know,
[11:39.330 --> 11:43.410]  if you look at it as the gold rush equivalent, as it has been named, you know,
[11:43.410 --> 11:47.450]  the green rush. Absolutely. During that time,
[11:47.850 --> 11:51.050]  everybody, all the gold miners had to have mining equipment,
[11:51.530 --> 11:54.730]  whether they were successful or not at the end of the day, that's the reality.
[11:56.410 --> 11:57.290]  And you know,
[11:57.290 --> 12:01.530]  this is basic equipment that gives somebody the edge in the green rush that
[12:01.530 --> 12:05.650]  allows you to be able to have a much finer view and control of the environment.
[12:06.170 --> 12:09.490]  And with that market there, the fact is
[12:11.290 --> 12:14.210]  it's all the homey growers and they're all missing out.
[12:14.330 --> 12:16.050]  They can go and spend three, 4,000,
[12:16.050 --> 12:19.130]  which was really pricing them out of the market for, you know,
[12:19.130 --> 12:20.810]  an equivalent ish system.
[12:22.290 --> 12:26.250]  Ours comes in at just trying to do the exchange rate conversion. Well,
[12:26.250 --> 12:30.450]  our basic entry unit, the minder, which doesn't have a screen on it,
[12:30.770 --> 12:33.730]  which is ideal for like large, but for really small home users,
[12:33.730 --> 12:37.290]  as well as all the way through to large growth spaces that need to have lots of
[12:37.290 --> 12:39.490]  sensors hanging in, you don't want to screen on all of them.
[12:40.090 --> 12:43.090]  So these are just small units, got the sensors hanging off them.
[12:44.210 --> 12:47.650]  We retail them for 70 pounds. Oh, well that's affordable.
[12:48.210 --> 12:51.970]  So that's what about $120? That's about 120 us dollars.
[12:51.970 --> 12:55.570]  So that's definitely affordable. Yeah. And if you're going, and you know,
[12:55.570 --> 12:59.170]  and then you get all that data on the website and we can,
[12:59.330 --> 13:00.770]  and we add analytics over time.
[13:01.010 --> 13:04.170]  If we have enough customers who say we'd like to see this,
[13:04.210 --> 13:06.690]  we can just add it to the website and everybody gets it.
[13:07.890 --> 13:11.090]  It doesn't require applications or software on people's phones, et cetera,
[13:11.090 --> 13:11.930]  to be updated.
[13:12.690 --> 13:15.290]  And that's, what's beautiful about it. I have seen in the short time,
[13:15.290 --> 13:18.250]  I've been working with you guys. I've seen vast improvements to the website.
[13:18.250 --> 13:21.410]  It was a little, it was very new when I was introduced to it.
[13:21.410 --> 13:23.810]  And now it looks like a professional website.
[13:23.810 --> 13:26.330]  It looks like one of the major companies. It looks like NASA now.
[13:26.330 --> 13:29.770]  I think it's really great. It's come a long way since we first started.
[13:31.090 --> 13:33.850]  Yeah, it has come a long way. I mean, it started off, yeah,
[13:33.850 --> 13:38.170]  the approach is the same as we've done with the product range is it starts off.
[13:39.010 --> 13:42.610]  It has to do what it needs to do and then worry about making it look pretty
[13:42.610 --> 13:46.010]  afterwards. There you go. So, you know,
[13:46.010 --> 13:48.930]  that's the first step is, is making sure it is what it is.
[13:48.970 --> 13:50.970]  I think in this industry, what it says on the tin,
[13:51.090 --> 13:53.610]  in this industry, too many people did that backwards.
[13:53.610 --> 13:56.450]  They tried to make it pretty and then figure out how to make it work.
[13:57.450 --> 13:58.290]  Yeah. Yeah.
[13:58.850 --> 14:02.290]  So you make a solution and then try and find a problem for it. Yes.
[14:02.490 --> 14:03.330]  That's the other.
[14:04.250 --> 14:07.170]  What you've told us about the, the 70 pound unit.
[14:07.170 --> 14:09.170]  What's the other unit you've got available for us?
[14:10.330 --> 14:14.330]  Well, the other one that we have is the Minder Plus and that has a screen on it.
[14:15.050 --> 14:20.610]  And that retails for 90 pounds. So about a hundred and 50 dollars,
[14:20.610 --> 14:22.050]  I guess. You're still very affordable.
[14:22.210 --> 14:24.450]  That's nice. Yeah.
[14:25.290 --> 14:27.770]  And the nice thing about that one is if you've got a sealed environment,
[14:27.770 --> 14:28.130]  for instance,
[14:28.130 --> 14:31.010]  you can mount it on the outside and then have the leads running into,
[14:31.170 --> 14:32.010]  into the environment.
[14:32.450 --> 14:36.170]  So you could have one on the outside that you can see what's going on.
[14:36.210 --> 14:40.130]  And then you could hang a couple of the other Minder units without screens
[14:40.530 --> 14:44.570]  within the space. If you wanted to monitor more, more areas.
[14:45.210 --> 14:48.770]  Now, how, how many square feet would you recommend?
[14:48.770 --> 14:51.170]  I hang each unit, how far apart would I need them?
[14:51.170 --> 14:53.330]  If I've got a large room, how many would I,
[14:53.370 --> 14:57.770]  would you recommend per square foot or so? Or I guess you do a meter there.
[14:57.770 --> 14:58.610]  I apologize.
[15:00.330 --> 15:04.650]  Oh, that's a good question. Actually. I mean, each sensor by default,
[15:04.690 --> 15:09.010]  I mean, each unit by default comes with two and a half meter leads,
[15:09.010 --> 15:10.890]  which is six,
[15:12.250 --> 15:13.330]  about seven or eight feet.
[15:15.370 --> 15:19.970]  Yeah. And we do them up to much longer leads as well. We do up to 10 meters,
[15:19.970 --> 15:21.850]  which is about 30 feet. Okay.
[15:24.330 --> 15:28.450]  So it really comes down to how tight somebody wants to be measuring it.
[15:28.450 --> 15:29.610]  I guess each one,
[15:31.570 --> 15:35.410]  I hang two in the house that's three meters wide,
[15:35.450 --> 15:38.370]  but that's two of the ambient ones and one at just each end of the greenhouse.
[15:38.770 --> 15:42.250]  A certain amount of that's going to depend on how much airflow you've got moving
[15:42.250 --> 15:45.330]  around the, the room as well. I mean,
[15:45.330 --> 15:48.450]  I've got one in a five meter by four meter area,
[15:48.450 --> 15:52.130]  and that gives me a relatively good, a good consistent reading.
[15:52.730 --> 15:55.450]  So probably five meters square would probably be good.
[15:55.450 --> 15:57.090]  You could possibly go a bit larger, but as I say,
[15:57.090 --> 15:59.570]  it depends on how much airflow you've got going around the room as well.
[16:00.090 --> 16:02.090]  That's quite a large space to monitor. That's a,
[16:02.090 --> 16:05.210]  that's pretty impressive for one unit. I like that. I expected less space.
[16:08.090 --> 16:09.050]  Yeah. I mean, I would, yeah.
[16:09.690 --> 16:13.170]  So most homegrows are going to be able to, would get away with just one unit.
[16:14.370 --> 16:17.970]  Exactly. I mean, and I say most of the customer base does.
[16:18.650 --> 16:20.370]  That is excellent. That's excellent.
[16:20.370 --> 16:21.850]  I could probably get away with one,
[16:21.850 --> 16:24.650]  maybe two and almost all of my larger grow rooms.
[16:27.090 --> 16:30.450]  And then what you can also do with them, I mean, a little sort of a nice bit,
[16:31.170 --> 16:33.650]  which is probably more relevant to the U S actually,
[16:33.650 --> 16:38.650]  cause you've got multiple time zones, which we don't have here.
[16:39.930 --> 16:43.050]  Is you can actually set each device to be in its own time zone.
[16:43.050 --> 16:44.330]  So when you're looking at the data,
[16:44.330 --> 16:46.690]  you're actually seeing it relevant to the local time.
[16:46.890 --> 16:47.730]  Oh, that's excellent.
[16:47.730 --> 16:50.530]  You're not having to do a mental calculation. So if you had grow facilities,
[16:50.530 --> 16:53.410]  if you, if you own, you know,
[16:53.410 --> 16:56.850]  multiple facilities and you want it to be actually keep an eye centrally on what
[16:56.850 --> 17:01.210]  was going on in each one of them locally in local time, you know,
[17:01.210 --> 17:04.650]  we support that straight away. And then that's something that
[17:05.770 --> 17:09.330]  I haven't necessarily seen on others, but I can't really comment too much.
[17:09.690 --> 17:10.530]  Well, that's a great feature.
[17:10.530 --> 17:15.530]  Sounds like when he has a plane flying overhead.
[17:18.210 --> 17:20.290]  Indeed. There's plenty of that each hour.
[17:21.610 --> 17:22.450]  Yeah.
[17:23.690 --> 17:28.370]  And then the, what are these two products,
[17:28.370 --> 17:33.170]  the minder and the minder plus there are entry level products and that's the
[17:33.170 --> 17:35.610]  ones that we've gone to market with to start.
[17:36.330 --> 17:40.930]  But the real sort of the crown jewel is, is the controller unit,
[17:40.970 --> 17:45.570]  which allows you to control humidifiers,
[17:45.570 --> 17:50.170]  dehumidifiers, fans, AC units, heaters,
[17:50.170 --> 17:51.010]  et cetera.
[17:51.930 --> 17:56.210]  By in response to readings from the sensors.
[17:58.010 --> 18:00.290]  So it comes with four, four sockets.
[18:01.370 --> 18:04.530]  And we're close to launching this in the UK.
[18:06.610 --> 18:10.450]  We've had a number of early adopters who've taken this up and this is where we
[18:10.450 --> 18:12.890]  also the U S market. And that's where, um,
[18:13.810 --> 18:16.810]  it gets really interesting is now the ability to automate the controlling of an
[18:16.810 --> 18:17.650]  environment.
[18:17.650 --> 18:20.970]  So when the humidity gets too low, then it'll fire up my humidifier.
[18:21.010 --> 18:23.130]  And then when it gets to the right temp, it'll turn that off.
[18:23.130 --> 18:25.570]  And then if it gets too high, it'll put my dehumidifier for me.
[18:26.970 --> 18:29.970]  Correct. Correct. Excellent. That's we can all use stuff like that.
[18:30.050 --> 18:32.090]  Automation is key and commercial grows.
[18:33.490 --> 18:35.410]  Yeah. And again, for the home grower,
[18:35.410 --> 18:38.570]  where, um, which is, you know,
[18:38.570 --> 18:42.730]  the target market with the technology being able to scale up in terms of what it
[18:42.730 --> 18:46.370]  can control in size and, um, magnitude,
[18:47.130 --> 18:51.730]  you know, a, a dehumidifier, a probably in the States, like a $50, you know,
[18:51.730 --> 18:56.130]  there's three humidifiers that only turn on. I mean,
[18:56.130 --> 18:59.050]  it's switch it on. You tell it how fast it needs to run.
[18:59.050 --> 19:01.050]  And that's about the only control you have over it.
[19:01.450 --> 19:04.170]  You can't tell it to cut off at different humidities. Right.
[19:04.410 --> 19:09.170]  If you want that you're spending like $500 on a humidifier that will know to turn
[19:09.170 --> 19:11.850]  off at 75% humidity, for example,
[19:12.770 --> 19:16.970]  there's a huge price difference in those systems. But with ours,
[19:17.330 --> 19:22.370]  this now allows somebody to take their 30 or $50 humidifier and make it perform
[19:22.530 --> 19:26.530]  like in terms of functionality, like a $500 humidifier,
[19:26.850 --> 19:29.450]  that's how it turned on and off only when it needs to come on and off.
[19:29.610 --> 19:30.490]  That's going to be helpful.
[19:30.810 --> 19:33.250]  Do you have a price point in mind for that unit when it's ready?
[19:35.170 --> 19:39.250]  In the UK, we're looking at 400 pounds for that unit.
[19:39.370 --> 19:42.530]  Okay. And that's worth it. That's may, it may sound like a high number,
[19:42.530 --> 19:45.250]  but for something that's going to turn on and off my devices,
[19:45.730 --> 19:47.010]  well worth the price there.
[19:47.050 --> 19:51.050]  That's more affordable than a major controller from a lot of the larger brands
[19:51.050 --> 19:53.090]  here. Will that,
[19:53.170 --> 19:55.970]  will that also be controlling the lights and all of the HVAC?
[19:57.370 --> 20:00.650]  Yes. You can tell it to control. It'll operate.
[20:00.650 --> 20:02.410]  It operates as a standalone unit as well.
[20:02.410 --> 20:06.690]  If you just had it completely standalone, it is like an agricultural timer.
[20:06.730 --> 20:08.250]  So it will do lights, pumps.
[20:09.890 --> 20:14.890]  It's when you then link it to one or more of the minor units that
[20:14.970 --> 20:17.930]  you get the additional functionality of, okay,
[20:18.090 --> 20:21.330]  I understand that's the humidity in that space. And it's connected to,
[20:21.610 --> 20:24.170]  this plug is connected to the humidifier that runs over there.
[20:24.210 --> 20:25.530]  I need to turn it on or turn it off.
[20:27.130 --> 20:29.330]  Excellent. This is going to be a great unit. You guys,
[20:29.410 --> 20:30.850]  I'm excited to get one of these.
[20:32.610 --> 20:37.010]  Yeah. Well, I mean, that's what we're looking for. We're looking for, you know,
[20:37.010 --> 20:41.330]  the interest from the, from the, from the US market. Yeah,
[20:41.330 --> 20:43.970]  there are from a purely, from a business perspective,
[20:43.970 --> 20:47.210]  there are opportunities clearly over there.
[20:47.210 --> 20:52.050]  We're looking to work with whoever we can to make it happen.
[20:52.130 --> 20:54.210]  There's different regulations in terms of
[20:56.930 --> 21:00.330]  electrical and all sorts of fun and fun and games. I must say it's a,
[21:00.370 --> 21:02.970]  it's great fun starting your own business.
[21:03.090 --> 21:04.210]  Oh, I'm sure you get to recommend it.
[21:04.250 --> 21:07.050]  You get to design a product and then master it there.
[21:07.050 --> 21:08.090]  And then before you send it to us,
[21:08.090 --> 21:10.930]  you have to redesign it because you have to redo a few things. I'm sure.
[21:13.290 --> 21:17.650]  Yeah. And there are 37 different plugs all around the world.
[21:17.850 --> 21:22.410]  So you could have find something. If you're going for a truly global market,
[21:22.450 --> 21:24.730]  you're going to have one that's 37 different plugs.
[21:24.890 --> 21:28.850]  How far into it were you before you realized 37 plugs were the option?
[21:31.330 --> 21:33.010]  Oh, I think we were fairly committed
[21:35.050 --> 21:38.370]  at that point. Yes. You had to buy all 37 plugs and figure them out.
[21:38.370 --> 21:41.090]  That's great. Well, I appreciate the work you've put into it. You guys,
[21:41.370 --> 21:42.290]  when do we,
[21:42.290 --> 21:46.730]  when can we expect the controller unit to be available for the U S market?
[21:50.330 --> 21:53.410]  Well, if everything goes according to plan over the next few months,
[21:53.410 --> 21:55.850]  we're probably looking towards,
[21:56.730 --> 22:01.010]  hopefully around about early next year. Okay. But that's, you know,
[22:01.410 --> 22:06.050]  I would much rather err on the side of caution than overly optimistic.
[22:06.610 --> 22:09.930]  Hey, if there's any of the right investors who happen to listen to this podcast,
[22:11.330 --> 22:12.650]  plug, you get in contact.
[22:16.330 --> 22:18.330]  Tell them since you're plugging yourself, Tom,
[22:18.330 --> 22:20.250]  how they can find you if they do want to reach out at you.
[22:21.250 --> 22:26.490]  Um, well you can contact either myself or Lee. Um,
[22:26.730 --> 22:31.610]  I email address it as Peter at peel grow systems and it's
[22:31.650 --> 22:35.410]  Lee at peel grow dot systems. Uh,
[22:35.650 --> 22:40.450]  also on Instagram it's at peel grow systems and our website
[22:40.490 --> 22:42.690]  is peel grow dot systems.
[22:43.610 --> 22:44.250]  There you go guys.
[22:44.250 --> 22:48.010]  If there are any investors out there looking to get into the business,
[22:48.090 --> 22:51.250]  this is a great opportunity and they could use your support.
[22:53.690 --> 22:56.930]  Yeah. And I mean, for the U S market in particular, um,
[22:58.010 --> 23:02.730]  we've got some particularly interesting ideas to leverage my and Lee's
[23:02.730 --> 23:05.170]  experience within the finance world. Um,
[23:06.010 --> 23:09.210]  there are some interesting things that can be done all of a sudden with the U S
[23:09.210 --> 23:12.850]  market. It really, it's amazing. I mean, just speaking about that,
[23:13.210 --> 23:14.610]  looking at from over here,
[23:14.610 --> 23:19.610]  it's absolutely crazy to see what's going on.
[23:22.410 --> 23:23.250]  It's inspirational.
[23:24.930 --> 23:29.210]  Do you see any legalization coming your way in your guys' area?
[23:32.290 --> 23:35.290]  I doubt that. Not any time soon.
[23:36.410 --> 23:40.250]  It's an interesting mixed bag because there are some economists who are saying
[23:40.250 --> 23:43.330]  within five years because of how much, you know,
[23:43.330 --> 23:46.690]  the rest of the world is changing. And you know,
[23:47.250 --> 23:52.250]  I don't know if it was white Mike or Guru on the do grow on the DGC show who
[23:54.250 --> 23:57.290]  said what coast to coast sales,
[23:57.290 --> 24:01.370]  it's now exceeding equivalent or exceeding cosmetic sales. I mean,
[24:01.370 --> 24:04.450]  that's a big industry. Yes. That was, that was my, you know,
[24:04.450 --> 24:07.490]  when you're up into the 50, I thought so.
[24:07.490 --> 24:11.050]  When you're up into the $50 billion market, yeah.
[24:11.050 --> 24:15.370]  The rest of the world starts to think, eh, maybe it's not so evil. Maybe no,
[24:15.370 --> 24:19.610]  it won't make you crazy. And actually no, it's all okay. Um,
[24:20.650 --> 24:23.010]  so I think, yeah, I think it's interesting to see what's happening.
[24:24.210 --> 24:26.450]  Money does money talk. That's the honest.
[24:26.890 --> 24:30.250]  We said the same thing at the same time. My friend money does talk.
[24:30.730 --> 24:32.970]  Money's got the loudest voice in the room every time.
[24:32.970 --> 24:35.280]  Yeah.
[24:36.120 --> 24:39.920]  Yeah. And when they lose the tax on cigarettes,
[24:41.040 --> 24:43.880]  I kind of go, shit, need to get it somewhere else.
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.840]  Yep. And maybe that'll be your guys's way in because I'm sure that when, uh,
[24:47.880 --> 24:50.440]  they legalize cannabis in your area,
[24:50.480 --> 24:53.960]  you will be in every grow room because you're already ahead of the game.
[24:56.760 --> 24:58.360]  Yeah. Over here. We've got, you know,
[24:58.360 --> 25:01.920]  we've got giant veg grows who are using the system in their outdoor, um,
[25:02.040 --> 25:04.400]  in their allotments over here. Um,
[25:05.000 --> 25:09.720]  so there's a whole interesting market here too, but, uh, um,
[25:10.160 --> 25:12.800]  picking it up and, you know, for anybody who is in the UK, who's,
[25:12.920 --> 25:16.640]  who is interested, um, NPK technologies,
[25:16.640 --> 25:17.920]  their hydroponic shop up North,
[25:17.920 --> 25:21.200]  they're probably quite happy to speak about their experience with it.
[25:21.200 --> 25:25.720]  They're using it in their lab at the moment and where we're working with
[25:26.040 --> 25:26.880]  them.
[25:28.160 --> 25:30.120]  And you said NPK technologies?
[25:31.120 --> 25:31.960]  Yeah.
[25:32.160 --> 25:35.040]  I'm going to check them out myself just because I'm very interested in what you
[25:35.040 --> 25:35.880]  guys are doing.
[25:37.400 --> 25:41.920]  They have a great podcast and, uh, and YouTube channel.
[25:42.600 --> 25:45.520]  They've had mammoth key on, I forget the guy's name from mammoth key,
[25:46.600 --> 25:51.520]  microbes, I should say. Um, uh, they've had him on a number of times.
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.400]  Okay. And also the guy from great white.
[25:55.240 --> 25:56.720]  There you go guys. Another great podcast.
[25:56.720 --> 25:59.680]  Yeah. It's a really good, really good, interesting podcast to listen to.
[26:00.120 --> 26:01.160]  We will check that out.
[26:02.480 --> 26:04.120]  Yeah. I mean, I'd be here. It's interesting. You know,
[26:05.160 --> 26:09.400]  start back into it. What I find when we've spoken to investors here,
[26:09.400 --> 26:14.400]  as soon as you talk about the U S market and the analogy with the gold miner and
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.400]  you know, the gold rush and the green rush and the gold mine equipment supplies.
[26:19.400 --> 26:22.720]  And that's what we're doing. And we're in that, you know,
[26:22.720 --> 26:25.920]  incendiary support business. We don't touch the product at all. You know,
[26:25.920 --> 26:30.080]  we don't process it. We don't touch it. It's got nothing to do with that. Um,
[26:31.120 --> 26:36.120]  and what I'm looking at to build into the system going forwards is the ability
[26:39.120 --> 26:44.120]  for your home grower to be able to select a strain from a database,
[26:44.440 --> 26:48.600]  see what the breeders flowering time is and what the average users flowering
[26:48.600 --> 26:53.240]  time was. They can select it, tell the system that's what I'm growing.
[26:53.280 --> 26:54.640]  I'm starting it on this date.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  I want you to budget for four weeks and then cut over to flower to the
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.120]  whichever the reader or the flowering average use of flower time for instance.
[27:04.520 --> 27:07.520]  So you can really make it easy for them. Um,
[27:08.440 --> 27:09.440]  and the system will do that.
[27:09.440 --> 27:11.400]  It will just do the lighting schedule for you for instance,
[27:11.600 --> 27:14.280]  and they can set up their pump schedule. Um,
[27:15.240 --> 27:17.440]  so where the pumps are linked to the lighting schedule.
[27:17.440 --> 27:20.200]  So if you change the lighting schedule, the pumps will automatically adjust.
[27:20.560 --> 27:23.480]  You've said never come on when the lights are off.
[27:24.360 --> 27:28.040]  Instead of you having to go around and change 15 different pump timers because
[27:28.360 --> 27:29.200]  you've changed the light shade.
[27:30.320 --> 27:33.000]  It just automatically updates itself and follows it.
[27:33.360 --> 27:38.160]  And that's going to save a grower time for a guy like myself who has 25 fans to
[27:38.160 --> 27:40.720]  go change. They've all just adjusted themselves for me.
[27:41.840 --> 27:44.680]  Yeah, exactly. That's going to save me time.
[27:46.480 --> 27:50.720]  Yeah. You're talking about VPD. Well, yeah,
[27:50.720 --> 27:54.200]  that's the other bit that comes into play is as the lights go off,
[27:54.240 --> 27:58.160]  temperature comes down, humidity goes up, BPD, you know,
[27:58.200 --> 28:03.000]  plummets for instance. And again, if you're humidify even a $500 humidifier,
[28:03.040 --> 28:05.120]  well, I guess $500 humidifier,
[28:05.120 --> 28:07.240]  it doesn't know that when the lights go off,
[28:07.280 --> 28:11.520]  it needs to drop to 50% humidity. Just as an example,
[28:12.160 --> 28:14.000]  from 75 to 50 when the lights are on,
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.360]  you need to keep it up here because of the increase in temperature.
[28:16.360 --> 28:17.200]  When the lights go off,
[28:17.200 --> 28:21.920]  you need to drop it because of the decrease in temperature. Um, again,
[28:21.920 --> 28:24.560]  that's something that, that, uh, yeah,
[28:24.560 --> 28:25.920]  this is the software that we're working on.
[28:25.960 --> 28:27.640]  That's what it does for the controller.
[28:30.000 --> 28:33.960]  The idea is to be able to tell that I want for the first five weeks to have a
[28:33.960 --> 28:38.440]  VPD of eight and for the next 10 weeks,
[28:38.440 --> 28:43.360]  VPD of 16 and the system just takes care of it for you in terms of monitoring
[28:43.380 --> 28:44.200]  temperature and humidity.
[28:44.480 --> 28:48.040]  That's pretty impressive. That's going to save me a lot of time, a lot of energy,
[28:48.040 --> 28:51.560]  a lot of questions. Uh, I can go in before the flowering cycle.
[28:51.560 --> 28:55.240]  I can set up what I need and then I can just know that it's all going to happen
[28:55.240 --> 28:55.960]  for me.
[28:55.960 --> 28:59.160]  I don't have to ask one of the grow techs to make sure to turn something down or
[28:59.160 --> 29:00.560]  turn something off. Uh,
[29:00.600 --> 29:05.160]  that's going to prevent a lot of error because humans make mistakes. Hopefully,
[29:05.800 --> 29:08.400]  uh, we've taken that out of the computers and they're not going to make those
[29:08.400 --> 29:12.160]  mistakes. So this is one of the other things that we've implemented as well,
[29:12.160 --> 29:13.440]  is that you can set an alert.
[29:13.480 --> 29:17.400]  So that way if your temperature does go above a particular level or your
[29:17.400 --> 29:19.720]  humidity goes above a particular level,
[29:19.720 --> 29:22.240]  you'll get an email that tells you that it's high.
[29:22.640 --> 29:26.360]  So you've got chance to go and intervene and you'll get one of them at the
[29:26.360 --> 29:29.800]  moment, every 15 minutes. So that way you get reminded that there's a problem.
[29:29.800 --> 29:32.320]  You've got a chance to go and fix it before any damage gets done.
[29:32.920 --> 29:35.960]  That way I can get in the car and drive right over there and unplug those lights
[29:35.960 --> 29:39.480]  before they roast my plants. I love it.
[29:39.560 --> 29:42.000]  Or you can tell, I mean, better still, you know,
[29:42.040 --> 29:43.920]  really what you can do is you can just,
[29:44.120 --> 29:46.640]  you should just go to the website and tell the controller to turn the lights
[29:46.680 --> 29:49.000]  off. Uh, you didn't have to get in the car.
[29:49.480 --> 29:50.320]  That's excellent.
[29:52.320 --> 29:54.880]  And that's a standard feature you get with the minder as well.
[29:54.920 --> 29:57.800]  Each of the minders other than just recording your data,
[29:57.800 --> 30:01.960]  you can also set your maximum and minimum temperature and humidity and you'll get
[30:01.960 --> 30:03.480]  emails if it breaches either of them.
[30:03.760 --> 30:05.680]  That is excellent. So I don't even have to drive.
[30:05.680 --> 30:08.400]  I can just say turn that off until I can finish recording.
[30:08.400 --> 30:09.640]  And then I'll go over there and fix that.
[30:11.080 --> 30:11.920]  Absolutely.
[30:12.160 --> 30:13.000]  I appreciate that.
[30:13.040 --> 30:17.480]  You know, for the, you know, from a shop's perspective,
[30:17.480 --> 30:22.480]  what's kind of nice is somebody can now walk in and they've got a
[30:22.480 --> 30:24.840]  problem with the gross at home.
[30:24.880 --> 30:27.480]  They can walk into the shop and they can actually show the guy behind the
[30:27.480 --> 30:30.760]  counter the data that they're always asking for, you know,
[30:30.760 --> 30:32.640]  what's your temperature and humidity been for the last week.
[30:33.440 --> 30:37.040]  And now they can show them. So instead of just, you know, standing there,
[30:37.040 --> 30:40.120]  looking at the guy, gormlessly like, uh, I don't know,
[30:40.160 --> 30:45.200]  hot and not very humid, you know, not, not very accurate.
[30:45.440 --> 30:48.200]  They can actually show them the data and get a far better analysis of what may
[30:48.200 --> 30:49.040]  be wrong.
[30:50.640 --> 30:52.840]  And spend from the consumer's point of view,
[30:52.840 --> 30:55.760]  spend less money on trying to solve the problem because they get it right the
[30:55.760 --> 30:56.600]  first time.
[30:57.760 --> 31:01.200]  And maybe reputation wise from the shop's perspective is that they're giving the
[31:01.200 --> 31:02.440]  right advice first time.
[31:02.840 --> 31:06.200]  Yes. So the pro the products are available online.
[31:06.200 --> 31:10.080]  If people want to go look for them, um, they can find you at PL grow systems.
[31:10.080 --> 31:10.920]  Is that correct?
[31:12.440 --> 31:16.240]  He'll grow systems, peel, grow dot systems. All right. So that's where the,
[31:16.320 --> 31:19.480]  the minder, the minder plus, and coming soon,
[31:19.520 --> 31:21.520]  the controller unit will be available.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.080]  Correct. Yes. All right. Now the pressure is on you guys.
[31:25.080 --> 31:27.680]  Cause I just told everybody that that controller unit is coming.
[31:27.680 --> 31:30.640]  So you guys got to get in the workshop there and start soldering.
[31:33.960 --> 31:36.560]  Oh, you've been in the workshop quite a lot.
[31:37.000 --> 31:38.720]  Okay. Okay. Um,
[31:39.080 --> 31:43.320]  but we have a number of early adopters who've been running it and are running it
[31:43.320 --> 31:45.200]  at the moment. Um, yeah,
[31:45.360 --> 31:48.360]  to help us make sure that we're going down the right line with it.
[31:50.400 --> 31:53.520]  From everything I have seen, you guys are going down the right line.
[31:53.520 --> 31:56.880]  The improvements on the website have been amazing. The upgrade to the, uh,
[31:56.920 --> 32:00.400]  the second system that you sent me was obvious the minute it came out of the
[32:00.400 --> 32:03.920]  box. Uh, the second one was much more sturdy. Uh,
[32:04.000 --> 32:07.720]  so I can see that you guys are improving every time we do business together.
[32:07.720 --> 32:09.000]  So it's noticeable already.
[32:10.720 --> 32:12.200]  Thank you. Yes, sir.
[32:14.680 --> 32:17.680]  Well, gentlemen, it feels like we have, Oh, it sounds like you've got something.
[32:17.680 --> 32:18.520]  Go ahead. Let's hear it.
[32:20.040 --> 32:23.280]  Yeah. Yeah. I'm just saying thank you very much. It's a most appreciated.
[32:23.400 --> 32:24.560]  Oh, thanks for joining me. Uh,
[32:24.600 --> 32:27.840]  thanks for taking some time out of your day to be on the show with me. Uh,
[32:27.880 --> 32:31.760]  it feels like we've covered all of the business part of the podcast and of the,
[32:31.760 --> 32:33.560]  uh, the interview. I don't like to call it an interview.
[32:33.560 --> 32:35.400]  It's more like hanging out with my friends. Uh,
[32:35.400 --> 32:39.520]  is there anything that you guys would like to say while you were on the podcast,
[32:39.520 --> 32:41.840]  anything you'd like to put out there while you've got a microphone on you?
[32:45.040 --> 32:45.880]  That's dangerous.
[32:49.880 --> 32:53.440]  No, I mean, I would just like to say a big thanks to everybody who has actually
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.480]  helped us so far. Um,
[32:56.160 --> 33:00.600]  it's not just a case of hard work and dedication to it,
[33:00.600 --> 33:05.600]  but it's also loyal clients and fans who've helped support us.
[33:05.920 --> 33:08.440]  That sounds a bit cheesy to the fans, but, but yeah,
[33:08.440 --> 33:12.760]  there are some people who have gone way beyond what we would expect in terms of
[33:12.760 --> 33:16.440]  helping to promote us. And that is really appreciated. Um,
[33:18.040 --> 33:20.760]  so yeah, I just like, yeah, that's pretty much it.
[33:22.200 --> 33:23.040]  That's respectable.
[33:23.200 --> 33:24.320]  I may be dedicated
[33:24.320 --> 33:26.840]  support of people like yourself, Jeff has helped us, uh,
[33:26.960 --> 33:29.920]  get a long way and, uh, it's, it's, it's really encouraging.
[33:30.320 --> 33:33.480]  It's encouraging us to do what we do. Uh, and we're loving it.
[33:34.360 --> 33:37.760]  Well, I appreciate the opportunity to work with your products and, uh,
[33:37.800 --> 33:38.800]  make friends with you guys.
[33:38.800 --> 33:42.440]  And it's an honor to be involved in something from the very beginning.
[33:42.440 --> 33:45.360]  I was part of it. I feel like I got one of the very first units.
[33:45.360 --> 33:49.040]  I feel like I got to see, uh, come a long way. So, uh,
[33:49.040 --> 33:51.320]  thank you for letting me be a part of it. Thanks for trying.
[33:51.320 --> 33:54.520]  Uh, and thanks for letting me advertise for you. I do appreciate that.
[33:55.720 --> 34:00.200]  Oh, no, we really, we really appreciate it. And speaking of products,
[34:00.200 --> 34:04.440]  we need to, um, ship you the two new, the newest design ones.
[34:04.440 --> 34:06.080]  We'll send a couple over, um,
[34:06.640 --> 34:10.760]  and we'll throw in an extra minding unit that you can give away as a prize to
[34:10.760 --> 34:11.600]  someone.
[34:12.240 --> 34:14.680]  That sounds amazing. I'm sure my listeners,
[34:14.720 --> 34:17.240]  my listeners are already trying to get ahold of you.
[34:17.240 --> 34:19.680]  That sounds amazing. I'm sure my listeners,
[34:20.120 --> 34:22.120]  my listeners are already drooling for that.
[34:22.120 --> 34:23.880]  They're already waiting to figure out how we're going to do that.
[34:23.880 --> 34:26.600]  So we'll set up a giveaway. I appreciate that more than you even know,
[34:26.600 --> 34:29.160]  that is going to make everybody really excited.
[34:31.200 --> 34:33.720]  And it would be good. You know, I'm just putting it out there on,
[34:33.800 --> 34:37.640]  to the other grow podcasts as well. It would be good to hear more about,
[34:38.440 --> 34:42.160]  you know, what are the best ways of maintaining, um, an environment?
[34:43.800 --> 34:46.960]  What are the tricks? Okay. Because it changes, you know, you know,
[34:47.040 --> 34:51.120]  there's small environments where people are growing in spaces that are three
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.520]  feet by two feet. And that's keeping that regulated compared to something that's,
[34:55.600 --> 34:58.720]  you know, 30,000 square feet is a very different game. I mean,
[34:58.720 --> 35:02.480]  even up to 10 by 10 foot, just an idea, you know,
[35:02.520 --> 35:05.760]  that whole how it changes and what are the tricks for being able to try and
[35:05.760 --> 35:06.600]  maintain it?
[35:06.600 --> 35:09.520]  That's a very ideal temperatures and humidities,
[35:09.520 --> 35:14.360]  because this is where BPD gets interesting is it can kind of throw conventional
[35:14.400 --> 35:16.280]  thinking out the window. Absolutely.
[35:18.600 --> 35:22.480]  Well, I'm glad you said that because the next podcast I have written is all
[35:22.480 --> 35:23.600]  about VPD.
[35:23.600 --> 35:27.040]  So we'll go from VPD and then we'll start talking about more environmental
[35:27.040 --> 35:31.640]  controls from there. So perfect timing. Great suggestion. I'm glad you said that.
[35:33.760 --> 35:36.480]  One of the things we've noticed is in our simulations,
[35:36.480 --> 35:38.560]  we've only got a small little setup at the moment,
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.960]  but once we got the VPD dialed in and we main managed to maintain it.
[35:42.960 --> 35:47.960]  So on our charts, you've got the maximum ideal VPD and the minimum VPD.
[35:48.440 --> 35:51.320]  We've managed to keep it pretty consistent between the lines.
[35:51.320 --> 35:54.080]  And within three days you can see the difference.
[35:54.080 --> 35:57.440]  The palms are just they're more turgid. They're, they're praying up more.
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.520]  It's such a significant difference when you can keep it in that zone.
[36:02.920 --> 36:04.560]  For the sake of clarity.
[36:07.240 --> 36:12.040]  Yeah. The minimum and maximum suggested VPD is precisely that it's suggested.
[36:12.040 --> 36:16.880]  We highly recommend that you look into it yourself before committing.
[36:17.400 --> 36:18.760]  Yes, it is a minefield.
[36:19.360 --> 36:24.360]  A little bit of a leaf size and shape difference may affect your desired VPD is
[36:25.240 --> 36:26.160]  something I've noticed.
[36:27.520 --> 36:28.360]  Yeah.
[36:28.920 --> 36:29.760]  All right gentlemen,
[36:29.800 --> 36:34.120]  find out what the target numbers are for you're using growing and then that's
[36:34.120 --> 36:34.960]  what you go from.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.520]  As is purely an indicative minimum and maximum.
[36:38.720 --> 36:39.960]  Yes. Something like a,
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.520]  like a hydroponic lettuce versus something that's not hydroponic.
[36:44.520 --> 36:46.760]  I'm, I don't want to say cannabis, but versus cannabis,
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.320]  you may have vastly different desired VPD.
[36:50.320 --> 36:54.840]  So pay attention to your plants and make sure you dial it in for your plants.
[36:56.200 --> 36:57.480]  Everything is a suggestion.
[36:57.480 --> 37:01.360]  There are no hard fast rules when it comes to growing cannabis. Well,
[37:01.360 --> 37:04.640]  gentlemen, I'm going to, yeah, we can chat for hours.
[37:04.640 --> 37:08.320]  That's what I was going to say. I'm going to wrap up the the podcast portion of
[37:08.320 --> 37:12.080]  this. I want to thank you guys for joining me for a really long hangout. Uh,
