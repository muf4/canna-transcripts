[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  Welcome to the show podcast world. It's time for episode 406 of the grow from your heart podcast.
[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's time to add new genetics to your garden and you can get them at dankseed.store.
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, across the table from me, it's White Mike. Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  Thanks, man. What's up, everybody?
[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  Thanks for coming in and hanging out with us, bro.
[00:21.000 --> 00:22.000]  Yeah, man.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  It's a weird foggy evening out there.
[00:24.000 --> 00:25.000]  It's a little bizarre.
[00:25.000 --> 00:27.000]  A little bizarre is a great description.
[00:27.000 --> 00:29.000]  Is that foggy or just so many dabs in the room?
[00:29.000 --> 00:32.000]  It smells like I said, it smells like rocks and water.
[00:32.000 --> 00:35.000]  And Mike looked at me like I was weird and he goes, yeah, you're right.
[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  He did not want to agree with that.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  It smells like fog.
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  Yeah, it smells like fog. It smells like hard water.
[00:39.000 --> 00:41.000]  If you're from Colorado, you know what that smells like.
[00:41.000 --> 00:42.000]  Welcome to the show, everybody.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  This is not going to be the hard water podcast.
[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  We're actually going to talk about some cannabis related stuff.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  It has become a tradition that we start the podcast off by talking about what we're dabbing.
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  I have got kind of a buffet of cannabis concentrates here on the table.
[00:56.000 --> 00:58.000]  I don't remember which ones I did and did not dab.
[00:58.000 --> 01:01.000]  I remember that the strawberry daiquiri really stood out to me.
[01:01.000 --> 01:03.000]  So let's talk about strawberry daiquiri.
[01:03.000 --> 01:04.000]  It was really sweet.
[01:04.000 --> 01:05.000]  It had a great flavor to it.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  All of the strawberry strains kind of have a similar flavor in my mind.
[01:10.000 --> 01:11.000]  That's strawberry candy.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  But there's also like a dusty sort of a thing behind it.
[01:14.000 --> 01:18.000]  It's the old half chewy strawberry candy.
[01:18.000 --> 01:20.000]  Oh, the ones with the goo in the middle.
[01:20.000 --> 01:22.000]  It was hard on the outside, gooey in the middle.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  And it had like a strawberry, like a fake strawberry wrapper on it.
[01:25.000 --> 01:26.000]  Yeah, that's kind of what it tastes like.
[01:26.000 --> 01:27.000]  Dude, you were accurate.
[01:27.000 --> 01:34.000]  This label here says it is 76.1% THC and 90.3% total cannabinoids.
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  It doesn't list those other cannabinoids, but it claims that they are there.
[01:38.000 --> 01:40.000]  I got me fairly nicely buzzed.
[01:40.000 --> 01:41.000]  Obviously I'm rambling.
[01:41.000 --> 01:44.000]  That could be a combination of all of these concentrates.
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  We had a few of them.
[01:45.000 --> 01:46.000]  There's a nice little selection.
[01:46.000 --> 01:48.000]  Do you remember what you just took a dab of?
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Not off the top of my head.
[01:50.000 --> 01:51.000]  I would have to look at the labels.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  That means that it must have worked.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  We'd just sound like assholes if we just read through that list of options.
[01:57.000 --> 01:58.000]  You can look quickly.
[01:58.000 --> 01:59.000]  What got your attention there?
[02:00.000 --> 02:01.000]  It was one of the tribes.
[02:01.000 --> 02:03.000]  It was either Star Tribe or Lost Tribe.
[02:03.000 --> 02:04.000]  Star Tribe.
[02:04.000 --> 02:06.000]  Because I asked you, what do you expect a Star Tribe to taste like?
[02:06.000 --> 02:10.000]  Because I remember the Lost Tribe, the smell was too spot on with the name.
[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000]  It was all grassy and body odor.
[02:12.000 --> 02:13.000]  Okay.
[02:13.000 --> 02:14.000]  And so I sat that one down.
[02:14.000 --> 02:15.000]  It was Star.
[02:15.000 --> 02:16.000]  Okay.
[02:16.000 --> 02:19.000]  And grassy and body odor, for some people, they're going to go, hey, I want to dab that.
[02:19.000 --> 02:21.000]  It's not a bad dab.
[02:21.000 --> 02:22.000]  It's just not what I was in the mood for.
[02:22.000 --> 02:23.000]  Exactly.
[02:23.000 --> 02:24.000]  That's why I like the variety.
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.000]  I've got strawberry.
[02:25.000 --> 02:26.000]  I've got oranges.
[02:26.000 --> 02:29.000]  I've got the Stardog, which is that fuely and fruity flavor.
[02:29.000 --> 02:30.000]  There's some jilly bean.
[02:30.000 --> 02:31.000]  There's some super silver haze.
[02:31.000 --> 02:36.000]  It's got that, I think it's almost got that dryer sheet aroma that I talk about.
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.000]  I just said I wasn't going to list all the concentrates, so we're going to stop there.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  Quit making people jealous and mad at us.
[02:41.000 --> 02:42.000]  People are like, come on, guys.
[02:42.000 --> 02:44.000]  I'm out here in whatever state I'm in.
[02:44.000 --> 02:45.000]  Get it legal in your area.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  I got a message from somebody, and they're saying, hey, you talk about the Colorado Crunch.
[02:48.000 --> 02:49.000]  Check this out.
[02:49.000 --> 02:51.000]  And they squeezed their buds on a video.
[02:51.000 --> 02:53.000]  They're like, this is what the dispensary here sells us.
[02:53.000 --> 02:54.000]  And it just exploded.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  It was like, and I was like, oh, man.
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  It was kind of similar to maybe some bottom of the jar Colorado Crunch stuff.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  Real hard.
[03:01.000 --> 03:02.000]  He told me the pricing.
[03:02.000 --> 03:04.000]  He's paying around 60 and 8.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  And I was like, oh, man, you're paying three times the price, but it's just as crunchy.
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  Similar crunch.
[03:10.000 --> 03:12.000]  The herb didn't look bad, but it was crunchy.
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  There's some questionable shit everywhere.
[03:15.000 --> 03:16.000]  Everywhere.
[03:16.000 --> 03:21.000]  I loved the Colorado Crunch episode, though, when I was bud tending all those moons ago.
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  That was a common thing.
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  People would come in and like, the place I hit last time, all the herb was dry.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  It's like, dude, it's Colorado.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  We don't have water here.
[03:31.000 --> 03:32.000]  Right.
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.000]  Notice how you're putting on lotion all the time, and you're all dry and flaky.
[03:35.000 --> 03:37.000]  Yeah, the weed feels it also.
[03:37.000 --> 03:38.000]  Yep.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  You really don't.
[03:39.000 --> 03:41.000]  It's that or Bavita flavor.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Take your pick.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  Yeah, I'm not sure which one I would prefer.
[03:44.000 --> 03:45.000]  The dry.
[03:45.000 --> 03:47.000]  The dry, because then it tastes like herb.
[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000]  I want that herb flavor.
[03:48.000 --> 03:52.000]  I actually have two grinders every now and then when you get some nice moisture.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  The grinder I normally use doesn't handle it well.
[03:55.000 --> 03:59.000]  So you actually switch up grinders for two different batches of herb?
[03:59.000 --> 04:09.000]  Yeah, if I notice, the herb's got a little more moisture content to it, and my daily use grinder's kind of chewing on it and not grinding it down into the next chamber, I'll switch grinders.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  That's pretty fucking funny.
[04:11.000 --> 04:17.000]  Then do you combine the two batches and mix them together so that you've got a little even?
[04:18.000 --> 04:29.000]  I prefer to smoke blends at the house, so I'll buy six or seven different eighths and then pull a little nug out of each, throw them into the grinder, and just combine them back and forth.
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  So, yeah, there's a lot of herb mixing and blending for bowls.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  There are people just smashing their phones onto the table listening to us.
[04:37.000 --> 04:41.000]  They're going, I live in prohibition land, and I hate you guys right now.
[04:41.000 --> 04:42.000]  Join us.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  It's the future here.
[04:43.000 --> 04:44.000]  Don't be mad.
[04:44.000 --> 04:45.000]  Embrace it.
[04:45.000 --> 04:48.000]  Be glad that we're bringing you to the table and letting you participate with us.
[04:48.000 --> 04:54.000]  I know it's got to be frustrating, though, to be somewhere where you can't even have concentrates, you can't even have access to good flour, but we've got it here.
[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000]  So do what you can do in your area to legalize cannabis so that you can consume it, possess it, have access to it.
[05:00.000 --> 05:02.000]  You said something funny a minute ago.
[05:02.000 --> 05:06.000]  This was totally not on my list of stuff to talk about.
[05:06.000 --> 05:20.000]  You know what really drives me crazy is when people say that this place has the best herb or this state has the best herb or this state has, yeah, bro, I bet you some of the best growers on the planet are just tucked away in places we don't even know about.
[05:20.000 --> 05:22.000]  It's the places that you never get to try their product.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  You'll never know who they are.
[05:23.000 --> 05:24.000]  They're quiet.
[05:24.000 --> 05:25.000]  They're hermits.
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.000]  There's good herb everywhere.
[05:26.000 --> 05:30.000]  We've got to quit saying that this one state has the best, this other has the best.
[05:30.000 --> 05:33.000]  Yeah, Colorado has a reputation for dry and crunchy herb.
[05:33.000 --> 05:34.000]  We won.
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  But you know what California's got a reputation for right now?
[05:36.000 --> 05:38.000]  A bunch of fucking pesticides.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  I'd rather smoke crunchy herb over pesticide herb, but we got to stop the whole competition thing.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  I don't think that you can't say Cali has the best.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  Have you smoked every grower in Colorado's herb?
[05:48.000 --> 05:50.000]  Have you smoked every grower in Oregon's product?
[05:50.000 --> 05:55.000]  It varies so much harvest to harvest, grow to grow.
[05:55.000 --> 05:56.000]  Absolutely.
[05:56.000 --> 06:02.000]  The herb grown up in the mountains is a lot different than the stuff grown down here in the valley.
[06:03.000 --> 06:09.000]  My summer and winter crops in the same grow room are going to be different just because I'm fighting different environmental factors.
[06:09.000 --> 06:14.000]  I'm going to have different VPDs based on the outside environment a little bit.
[06:14.000 --> 06:18.000]  The rooftop air conditioners can't handle some shit in the winter.
[06:18.000 --> 06:21.000]  That air conditioner return may bring in a little extra cold.
[06:21.000 --> 06:24.000]  I was just thinking of the fog rolling in and I was like, you never know what's going to happen.
[06:24.000 --> 06:29.000]  And it varies batch to batch and room to room and grow to grow, grower to grower, harvest to harvest.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  And that room has been corrected by the way.
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.000]  The fog used to come in and air conditioner return in a facility Mike and I used to be involved in.
[06:36.000 --> 06:38.000]  It doesn't anymore, but that was a really funny morning.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  Came in and the grow room was foggy from outside.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  Yep.
[06:43.000 --> 06:51.000]  I mean, it's going to vary wildly, but I think there are some places where good herb is a lot easier to find than other places.
[06:51.000 --> 06:52.000]  Right.
[06:53.000 --> 06:58.000]  Man, when I've spent time on the East Coast, I know there's good weed there.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  It's just not obvious like it is here.
[07:00.000 --> 07:01.000]  Yeah, you can't be.
[07:01.000 --> 07:04.000]  I still see people smoking herb from time to time out in the world.
[07:04.000 --> 07:06.000]  It's just, it's really bad herb.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  But there are also, there's got to be, I'm sure every state and every town probably, there's got to be.
[07:13.000 --> 07:14.000]  Yeah.
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  If you look at the numbers.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  One dude that is just cranking out some fire.
[07:18.000 --> 07:19.000]  It may not get anywhere.
[07:19.000 --> 07:20.000]  It may stay in his jar.
[07:21.000 --> 07:22.000]  Or his little circle.
[07:22.000 --> 07:23.000]  Yeah.
[07:23.000 --> 07:24.000]  Or his little crew.
[07:24.000 --> 07:25.000]  Yeah.
[07:25.000 --> 07:38.000]  If you look at how the cannabis industry developed over the last 30 years, for most of the country, it's little home growers selling to five, six, eight, nine, 10, 15 people.
[07:38.000 --> 07:43.000]  And those people each have six, eight, 10, 15 customers.
[07:43.000 --> 07:46.000]  And that's as far as that little bubble goes.
[07:47.000 --> 07:54.000]  And so it looks like one of those little star graphs where there's a little line and then a circle and then little lines coming off that circle, the other little dots.
[07:54.000 --> 07:55.000]  Right.
[07:55.000 --> 07:58.000]  Bad description there, but you guys know what I'm talking about.
[07:58.000 --> 07:59.000]  It's a cluster.
[07:59.000 --> 08:01.000]  It's a grower in the middle and then little spider legs come off of it.
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  And then you got guys that buy quarter pounds.
[08:04.000 --> 08:07.000]  And then off the quarter pound guys, you got guys that buy ounces.
[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  And off the ounce guys, you guys mostly probably buy eighths and quarters after that.
[08:11.000 --> 08:12.000]  Like it just breaks down.
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  And there's the new kid who wants to start dealing, who takes all the people who want to buy grams.
[08:16.000 --> 08:17.000]  Yep.
[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  He gets a quarter and sells enough grams to make himself a gram.
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  Yep.
[08:21.000 --> 08:22.000]  Yep.
[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  Take a quarter, break it into seven grams, smoke one, sell six, have enough money to buy the next quarter.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  It's got to be frustrating.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  It's where so many people started.
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  Yep.
[08:30.000 --> 08:31.000]  That's how, yeah.
[08:31.000 --> 08:33.000]  But that's the system coast to coast.
[08:34.000 --> 08:48.000]  I'm sure there's phenomenal growers in parts of the South and parts of the East coast where you wouldn't think of as herb centric, but you got to come West people just to see what you're missing.
[08:48.000 --> 08:53.000]  I know some really good growers down South.
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000]  We just can't talk too much about them.
[08:54.000 --> 08:55.000]  Right.
[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  Allegedly.
[08:56.000 --> 08:57.000]  Allegedly.
[08:57.000 --> 08:59.000]  There could be some good growers down South.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  I see pictures all the time.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  It was like, this is allegedly Mississippi, but it looks fire.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  This is from New Orleans.
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  It looks fire.
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.000]  I see stuff in New York that's, I've smoked shit in New York.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  It was amazing.
[09:11.000 --> 09:12.000]  Right.
[09:12.000 --> 09:14.000]  Well, there's some famous product that comes from New York.
[09:14.000 --> 09:16.000]  And it's expensive as shit in New York.
[09:16.000 --> 09:17.000]  Yeah.
[09:17.000 --> 09:18.000]  Mike's eyes lit up like this.
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  This is small town, New York, not New York city.
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  And it was so expensive, but it was worth it.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  And now people are going to say expensive because expensive is very relative based on location.
[09:29.000 --> 09:30.000]  It depends on where you are.
[09:30.000 --> 09:32.000]  We saw prices drop here drastically.
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  I always laugh when people say the black market is flourishing and legal pot states.
[09:37.000 --> 09:38.000]  And it's like, really?
[09:38.000 --> 09:39.000]  Yeah.
[09:39.000 --> 09:40.000]  Well, it went.
[09:40.000 --> 09:41.000]  It's hard.
[09:41.000 --> 09:43.000]  You went from 4,000 a pound to 1,000 a pound.
[09:43.000 --> 09:44.000]  Quickly.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  Or less.
[09:45.000 --> 09:46.000]  Quickly.
[09:46.000 --> 09:47.000]  10 years.
[09:47.000 --> 09:48.000]  Very quickly.
[09:48.000 --> 09:53.000]  And 10 years doesn't sound like a long time, but when it goes from 4,000 to 1,000 in 10 years, that is a, if you're,
[09:54.000 --> 09:58.000]  if you were somebody who was kind of used to having that sort of income, it made a huge change in your life.
[09:58.000 --> 10:05.000]  It fully used to be possible to make a comfortable living as a single adult male with three or four lights.
[10:05.000 --> 10:06.000]  Four lights was perfect.
[10:06.000 --> 10:13.000]  If you had four bloom lights and a little, a clone area with a T5, you could make a comfortable living.
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  Yeah.
[10:14.000 --> 10:16.000]  Not anymore.
[10:16.000 --> 10:18.000]  No, now that, no, that's not.
[10:18.000 --> 10:24.000]  All of those people in Colorado have either moved to prohibition land or gotten into a different part of the game.
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  Or they're employed in the legal cannabis industry at this point because they already know how to grow.
[10:28.000 --> 10:29.000]  All right.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  So I've got an email from a listener.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  This is the part of the podcast that I actually had written down on my notes.
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  I think this is a great email.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  I'm scrolling down to the actual good part.
[10:37.000 --> 10:38.000]  I've got a bunch of replies going on here.
[10:38.000 --> 10:44.000]  So this one comes from somebody who we are going to keep their name anonymous for reasons that you will understand as the message goes on.
[10:44.000 --> 10:45.000]  Hi, anonymous.
[10:45.000 --> 10:46.000]  Thanks for emailing.
[10:46.000 --> 10:47.000]  Yeah.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  By the way, before we get too far in this, if you'd like to send me an email, my email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[10:53.000 --> 10:57.000]  I would love to have your email as a question on the show.
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  Maybe you've got a question.
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  Maybe you've just got something you'd like to say.
[11:00.000 --> 11:02.000]  A lot of people reach out with compliments.
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  I'm not fishing for compliments.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  I'm saying that a lot of people do reach out with them and I love all of the compliments.
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  I'll get to reading a few of those on the show.
[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  Anything you'd like to say, you can address myself.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  Anything you want to say to Mike, anything about the show, reach out.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  Growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[11:16.000 --> 11:19.000]  Mike's looking around the room like you're trying to dry or she'd smell it out of nowhere.
[11:19.000 --> 11:20.000]  That's strange.
[11:20.000 --> 11:21.000]  You're going to have a stroke.
[11:21.000 --> 11:22.000]  Maybe.
[11:22.000 --> 11:23.000]  We'll keep it on.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  That's almonds, bro.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.000]  I'm not smelling almonds.
[11:25.000 --> 11:26.000]  I thought it was toast.
[11:26.000 --> 11:28.000]  I think we read different books.
[11:28.000 --> 11:30.000]  Yes, we read different books.
[11:30.000 --> 11:33.000]  All right, Mike, a long time ago, you told me something that I thought was really funny.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  You said, you know what takes out more gardens than police?
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  You know what takes out more gardens than bugs?
[11:38.000 --> 11:41.000]  You know what takes out more gardens than thieves and criminals?
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  I said, what is this thing you're talking about that takes out a lot of gardens?
[11:45.000 --> 11:51.000]  Mike, while I've got you here on the microphone, remind everybody what takes out so many gardens.
[11:51.000 --> 11:52.000]  Angry girlfriends, bro.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  Angry girlfriends, bro, without hesitation.
[11:55.000 --> 11:57.000]  You knew where I was headed with that.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  Yes, one of my golden rules is don't tell people about your garden.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  Never tell other people about your garden.
[12:05.000 --> 12:06.000]  I'm a giant hypocrite.
[12:06.000 --> 12:07.000]  I come on social media.
[12:07.000 --> 12:10.000]  I come up here on a podcast and I talk about I grow cannabis.
[12:10.000 --> 12:11.000]  Yes, I live in Colorado.
[12:11.000 --> 12:17.000]  I run a commercial facility where we've got millions of dollars in licensing, thousands of dollars of equipment.
[12:17.000 --> 12:18.000]  We pay a bunch of taxes.
[12:18.000 --> 12:19.000]  They know we're there.
[12:19.000 --> 12:20.000]  There's nothing to hide.
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.000]  Got a commercial facility.
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  I do consulting for a lot of places.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  I'm able to do my job and talk about it.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  I don't know your situation.
[12:27.000 --> 12:28.000]  I don't know where you're located.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  I don't know who you are.
[12:29.000 --> 12:30.000]  I don't know who you associate with.
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  I don't know who your local sheriff is.
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  I don't know what's going on.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  Wherever you are, if you're a new grower, one of my first pieces of advice is to STFU.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  Shut the fuck up.
[12:40.000 --> 12:42.000]  There's no need to talk about it.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  No need to talk about it.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  And I know, again, I'm a hypocrite.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  I love to post cannabis pictures.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  I'm in Colorado.
[12:48.000 --> 12:49.000]  If you can cover yourself, do it.
[12:49.000 --> 12:56.000]  If you're somewhere in an illegal state, if you're somewhere in a medical state and you are unsure of your surroundings, just don't talk about it.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  There's no need.
[12:57.000 --> 12:58.000]  Don't take your best friend there.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  Don't take your cousin there.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  There's no need to even take your brother there.
[13:01.000 --> 13:04.000]  Especially don't take a new relationship there.
[13:04.000 --> 13:06.000]  I was going to say girlfriend, but it's 2019.
[13:06.000 --> 13:07.000]  It could be your boyfriend.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  It could be your girlfriend.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  You could be dating a space alien that identifies as a dolphin.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  Don't take that person there.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  They still identify as a person if they're a space alien slash dolphin, right?
[13:17.000 --> 13:18.000]  Probably.
[13:18.000 --> 13:20.000]  I'm going to call them a person just because it's getting confusing.
[13:20.000 --> 13:33.000]  The reason we phrase this rule like we do is because when this rule was the golden rule or became the golden rule, growers were predominantly young white males.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  Sorry.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  That's just how it was.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  You're absolutely right.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  Also, ex-girlfriends and girlfriends ruin the highest percentage of grows.
[13:43.000 --> 13:48.000]  More than user error, more than cops, more than other criminals.
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  Breaking up, it kills more gardens than fucking anything else.
[13:54.000 --> 13:57.000]  More gardens than anything else.
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  All right.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  That brings us to this email.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  I don't know what my face just did.
[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  I just made a really weird noise.
[14:01.000 --> 14:02.000]  I hope nobody else heard that.
[14:02.000 --> 14:03.000]  That brings us to this email.
[14:03.000 --> 14:04.000]  It goes a lot like this.
[14:04.000 --> 14:05.000]  It says, hey, Ross to Jeff.
[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  I'm writing you from prohibition land and I've made a huge mistake.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  I broke your rule about not telling anyone, even your girlfriend.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  This guy already done fucked up.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  We told you so, bro.
[14:16.000 --> 14:17.000]  Not to rub it in.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  He goes on to say, predictably, breaking up with her was a gigantic mistake.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  No, it wasn't, dude.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  If this is how it turned out, it wasn't a mistake.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  I'm glad you finally did it, bro.
[14:27.000 --> 14:32.000]  Headache, pain in the ass, et cetera, but doesn't sound like a mistake, bro.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  Absolutely the right thing to do.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  He goes on to say, she's angry and already sent the law to my house.
[14:38.000 --> 14:39.000]  I turned them away.
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  Not cool.
[14:40.000 --> 14:41.000]  Exactly.
[14:41.000 --> 14:42.000]  Not cool, bro.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  I turned them away for lack of a warrant.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  Good job, man.
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  Good, smart move.
[14:46.000 --> 14:47.000]  Good move.
[14:47.000 --> 14:51.000]  Then he goes on to say, I tore down anything green, but I have no idea if they will be back.
[14:51.000 --> 14:52.000]  They'll be back.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  See, that's what I said.
[14:54.000 --> 14:59.000]  He goes on to say, if, hypothetically, a grow existed, it does not anymore.
[15:00.000 --> 15:06.000]  I am pretty bummed about the loss, allegedly, but I don't know what to do with my gear and my genetics.
[15:06.000 --> 15:09.000]  I've got a little over $400 worth of seeds from you alone.
[15:09.000 --> 15:15.000]  Hey, dude, big shout out for the Iry Genetics Collection, he says, and another dollar amount from elsewhere.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  We don't need to put that number in here.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  He also says, who knows how much money in equipment?
[15:20.000 --> 15:21.000]  I really don't know.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  I really don't want to give them up.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  That's kind of a setback that might make me give up altogether, but I need to keep my nose clean
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  until I can find a new place.
[15:30.000 --> 15:35.000]  Then he says, what can and should I do with it all?
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  I'm wary of cluing anyone else in to keep my shit for a few months, and I'm wondering if some seeds
[15:40.000 --> 15:46.000]  and a few boxes filled with general indoor growing equipment are enough to lose sleep over.
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.000]  Should I find a new home for the equipment and flush the genetics?
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  Can I take them out of the fridge and hide them somewhere else for a few months?
[15:53.000 --> 15:55.000]  If so, how should I store them?
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  Then he says, thanks, bro.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  I really appreciate the advice.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  Just call me, the grower who ought to have known better.
[16:02.000 --> 16:04.000]  So, bro, thank you for the great email.
[16:04.000 --> 16:06.000]  You ought to have known better.
[16:06.000 --> 16:10.000]  Now, Mike, what do you think is the best plan of action for this guy?
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  The first thing I told him was stay cool for a while.
[16:13.000 --> 16:14.000]  They're coming.
[16:14.000 --> 16:15.000]  They're coming.
[16:15.000 --> 16:17.000]  Just keep in mind they'll be back.
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  They're coming.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  If they wasn't going to come, they wouldn't have come the first time.
[16:22.000 --> 16:28.000]  The fact that they showed up the first time means their plate is empty enough to fill with your ass.
[16:31.000 --> 16:34.000]  Who knows what the ex told them.
[16:34.000 --> 16:40.000]  It clearly wasn't anything too over the top, or they would have showed up the first time differently.
[16:40.000 --> 16:48.000]  The fact that they showed up or told to go away and get a warrant and they left tells me she's probably just said plants.
[16:49.000 --> 16:56.000]  If you cut down and remove any clear evidence of cannabis production, you should be good to go.
[16:58.000 --> 17:07.000]  If you have all the equipment set up and seeds in a drawer and grow books on a shelf but no plants under the lights,
[17:07.000 --> 17:14.000]  you're probably still exposed to some criminal penalties depending on where in Prohibition land you are.
[17:15.000 --> 17:18.000]  Without revealing too much, I've asked questions.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  He is in a state that has medical cannabis but not any provisions for legal growing.
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  Honestly, your best bet is to take it all down and put it all somewhere else for a while.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  That's pretty much what I thought you would say.
[17:34.000 --> 17:35.000]  My advice...
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  Until you move.
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  My advice was to get rid of anything green, anything soil, anything root ball, anything organic needs to go.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  There's other ways to go about this.
[17:45.000 --> 17:53.000]  If you feel like really getting into a fuck you match with the cops and your ex, leave all the grow equipment up, run to Home Depot,
[17:53.000 --> 17:58.000]  get some celery and some tomatoes and just go hog wild when they show up.
[17:58.000 --> 17:59.000]  Like, come on, let me show you the garden.
[17:59.000 --> 18:02.000]  These are my organic tomatoes and this is my organic celery.
[18:02.000 --> 18:06.000]  I don't even have notes written down and that was going to be option number three for me.
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.000]  Was to leave all of this shit up and go hang tomatoes or go put tomatoes under there and when they come be like,
[18:11.000 --> 18:12.000]  yeah man, I got a bunch of...
[18:12.000 --> 18:13.000]  You want some organic tomatoes?
[18:13.000 --> 18:14.000]  They're fucking delicious.
[18:17.000 --> 18:21.000]  That's going to cost you money and time and energy.
[18:21.000 --> 18:30.000]  If you're into homegrown produce, it's a fun option but honestly, I'd pack everything up and I'd take it to my mom's house.
[18:30.000 --> 18:31.000]  Absolutely.
[18:31.000 --> 18:34.000]  My advice, again, I predicted that my advice...
[18:35.000 --> 18:39.000]  I knew my advice because I knew that but I told him my advice would be to get rid of anything organic.
[18:39.000 --> 18:42.000]  I told him gear isn't illegal, books aren't illegal.
[18:42.000 --> 18:48.000]  I told him the seeds may, depending on where he is, how paranoid he is, those seeds may, he may want to do something with the seeds.
[18:48.000 --> 18:49.000]  Those seeds can be very, very illegal.
[18:49.000 --> 18:53.000]  Seeds can be intent to cultivate in certain places.
[18:53.000 --> 19:03.000]  I remember picking through stashes carefully and discarding seeds because people had recently been busted and were charged with intent to cultivate
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  because they had a jar that they threw all their seeds in.
[19:05.000 --> 19:07.000]  Those seeds need to go somewhere as well.
[19:07.000 --> 19:11.000]  The equipment isn't illegal to have and he bought that somewhere.
[19:11.000 --> 19:12.000]  It's normal equipment.
[19:12.000 --> 19:14.000]  You can have that as long as you don't have a cannabis plant under that.
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  That's just normal agro light.
[19:16.000 --> 19:17.000]  It's just a normal light.
[19:17.000 --> 19:22.000]  My advice was to get rid of all the organic stuff and consider getting rid of the seeds.
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  Now, I'm adjusting my advice saying those seeds should go.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  I predicted that your advice would be to get rid of all the organic and to pack up all the equipment.
[19:30.000 --> 19:33.000]  I knew that Mike would take it that extra step just because that's how Mike goes.
[19:33.000 --> 19:42.000]  My third piece of advice was going to be if you really want to fuck with them and you want to have an excuse as to why your electric bill was high, as to why you have all of that gear because it's been running.
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  Depending on where you are, that's what they're doing right now.
[19:44.000 --> 19:46.000]  They're going to pull the electric bill.
[19:46.000 --> 19:52.000]  They need stuff for the warrant and his angry ex-girlfriend called and said, isn't usually enough.
[19:53.000 --> 20:07.000]  They dig through your trash or pull your electric bill and a couple of neighbors' electric bills so that they can show the judge, look, the third house on the block is drawing 10 times the power of any other house on the street.
[20:07.000 --> 20:09.000]  Clearly, something's amiss.
[20:09.000 --> 20:11.000]  Plus, the girlfriend's statements.
[20:11.000 --> 20:14.000]  Plus, we found green leafy matter in his trash can.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  That's enough for your warrant.
[20:16.000 --> 20:19.000]  Plus, when we knock on the door, we smell the skunky aroma.
[20:20.000 --> 20:23.000]  Keep thinking that they are going to come back.
[20:23.000 --> 20:26.000]  Bottom line, get rid of the plants.
[20:26.000 --> 20:28.000]  Get rid of organic material.
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  Get rid of precursor, which means seeds.
[20:30.000 --> 20:32.000]  Get rid of all of that stuff.
[20:32.000 --> 20:34.000]  The second option, get rid of the equipment also.
[20:34.000 --> 20:36.000]  Just get it gone quickly.
[20:36.000 --> 20:38.000]  Be discreet about it.
[20:38.000 --> 20:39.000]  Get it out of there.
[20:39.000 --> 20:40.000]  Keep an eye on your trash.
[20:40.000 --> 20:42.000]  Like Mike just said, they're going to go through your trash.
[20:42.000 --> 20:44.000]  They're going to watch your electric bill.
[20:44.000 --> 20:45.000]  They're going to pay attention.
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  You really want to be smooth.
[20:46.000 --> 20:53.000]  Allegedly, one thing that you could do, and we are not recommending any sort of illegal activity, put some fucking tomatoes under those plants and grow yourself some tomatoes.
[20:54.000 --> 20:55.000]  Under those lights, yeah.
[20:55.000 --> 20:56.000]  That's what I meant.
[20:56.000 --> 20:57.000]  Yeah, thanks, Mike.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  We said get rid of.
[20:59.000 --> 21:04.000]  There's a lot of steps in get rid of that don't involve your own trash can.
[21:04.000 --> 21:05.000]  Right.
[21:06.000 --> 21:14.000]  I don't want to advise you on how to destroy the evidence of a potential crime, but your trash can is going to get gone through.
[21:16.000 --> 21:17.000]  That's just how it be.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  Possibly already has and will be again.
[21:20.000 --> 21:30.000]  Like you can pull up videos on YouTube where like cops raid wrong house and it started because dude left grow store had his license plate written down.
[21:30.000 --> 21:44.000]  Six months later, when the cop got a free week, they ran around and checked on some of those license plates and just did trash inspections and they found legit like herbal tea for a head cold in this dude's trash can.
[21:44.000 --> 21:58.000]  And him and his son had like a little veggie lab going in the basement and they ended up with machine guns pressed to their temples while they were handcuffed on the floor after their house got flashbacked and their door exploded.
[21:58.000 --> 21:59.000]  Like.
[22:00.000 --> 22:05.000]  If you already know the cops are coming to your house, your job is a responsible humanist to clean that shit up.
[22:07.000 --> 22:08.000]  Mike, you're making me paranoid.
[22:09.000 --> 22:10.000]  Fucking move, dude.
[22:10.000 --> 22:11.000]  Go somewhere else.
[22:11.000 --> 22:15.000]  Just pack your stuff up when you can move in and start fresh again.
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  When you move, it's just not worth your freedom.
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  Don't even start fresh in the next place.
[22:19.000 --> 22:25.000]  You have to move somewhere and tell until you get cleaned up until they forget and then go to another place.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  If you think you're going to start again, you have to skip a spot.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  I don't know about that.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  Cops have pretty full plates everywhere.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  Like right now they've got a name and address.
[22:35.000 --> 22:38.000]  As soon as those two pieces of information are in separate places.
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.000]  Like if you move to a new place, you're pretty good to go.
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  I think it was the cops I was still worried about.
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.000]  Nah, this is a crazy bitch.
[22:46.000 --> 22:47.000]  She can find you on Facebook.
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  Brown is way hard to get away from.
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  Mike, I like how you just kind of grumbled all of that.
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  It's just like, oh, it's like the drunk guy at the bar.
[22:56.000 --> 23:01.000]  Like you were trying not to talk about how ugly my dreadlocks were, but then you took a shot and it just came out.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  This fucking guy's got the ugliest fucking hair over here.
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  I don't know what's going on.
[23:04.000 --> 23:16.000]  Like seriously, think about the 15 or 20 people we've known over the years that have really had a garden just vanish, get destroyed, get them in a bunch of trouble.
[23:17.000 --> 23:22.000]  In almost every instance, it was a disgruntled employee or girlfriend.
[23:22.000 --> 23:23.000]  Yep.
[23:23.000 --> 23:24.000]  In almost every instance.
[23:24.000 --> 23:25.000]  Yeah.
[23:26.000 --> 23:34.000]  It's almost never the cops showed up on an anonymous tip from a complete stranger who happened to smell it walking by.
[23:35.000 --> 23:41.000]  Like our local sheriff had to do a big PR stunt with a bunch of anti-pot locals to get that shit to happen.
[23:41.000 --> 23:44.000]  In the rest of the world, that don't happen very often.
[23:45.000 --> 23:52.000]  It's almost always a disgruntled ex-girlfriend or a buddy you showed that just got in some different trouble that wants out.
[23:53.000 --> 23:58.000]  That's why you shut up and don't tell anybody about your bro in Prohibition Land.
[23:59.000 --> 24:00.000]  There you go.
[24:00.000 --> 24:10.000]  It's part of the reason the Colorado and Washington, Oregon, California kids went so nuts talking about our garden and posting pics for a while is because we weren't allowed to for so long.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  That's when I really understood the whole point behind the super flamboyant gay pride parade.
[24:17.000 --> 24:26.000]  As soon as I was finally allowed to be open and public about some shit that I was totally not allowed to be open and public before, I was like, oh, now I get the fucking glitter overalls.
[24:26.000 --> 24:27.000]  It makes sense now.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  Mike, thank you.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  I needed that lesson in life right there.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  I did not do gay pride math.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  It didn't connect in my head until then.
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  I get it now.
[24:38.000 --> 24:45.000]  That big glitter bomb was just fucking held so tight and that big glitter bomb fucking exploded and came out like it did.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  I get it now.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  We saw it here.
[24:47.000 --> 24:51.000]  We voted in 2012 to make it legal.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  An hour later, social media exploded with garden pics.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  Very true.
[24:57.000 --> 24:58.000]  This is legal now.
[24:58.000 --> 25:04.000]  I can't accidentally ruin my life with a social media post of a plant.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  It's just a picture I took of a room with plants in it.
[25:08.000 --> 25:14.000]  If there's not a dead body in the picture, you shouldn't be able to get in a bunch of trouble for it.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  Pictures of plants could get you in a fuckload of trouble before.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  Very true.
[25:18.000 --> 25:19.000]  They don't now.
[25:19.000 --> 25:24.000]  Mike, I'm still blown away how you've opened my mind to...
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  It really made sense to me.
[25:28.000 --> 25:29.000]  No, it makes perfect sense.
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  I never thought of it like that.
[25:31.000 --> 25:32.000]  My mind needed that lesson.
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  You see social media with it.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  There's memes and jokes about it.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  It's like the MyState legalized weed starter pack or the I trim a pound in three days starter pack.
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  There's a bunch of them.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  It's because we went apeshit for a long time with it.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  We still are going apeshit with it.
[25:50.000 --> 25:51.000]  It's fun to brag.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  We feel bad doing it sometimes because we know y'all out in prohibition land don't have what we have here.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  We want you to have what we have here.
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  We just want you to make it legal in your area.
[26:00.000 --> 26:01.000]  Right.
[26:01.000 --> 26:02.000]  Oh yeah, we're full here.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  What the fuck, Hawaii?
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  It's full here.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  We're talking about screwing shit up.
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  I'm going to skip that.
[26:07.000 --> 26:13.000]  I love it when I'm in Denver at a comedy show or somewhere and somebody sees my iReed Genetics Colorado shirt.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  They're like, oh, what do you do?
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  Are you from here?
[26:15.000 --> 26:16.000]  I'm like, I run a grow.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  I do grow stuff, weed stuff.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  They're just like, oh yeah.
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  It triggers so much conversation.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  They just have so many questions and I love it.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.000]  I love the out of staters that want to just talk about cannabis all day long.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  I don't know why I have an alarm going off right now, but that was very unprofessional podcasting.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  Which piece of equipment needs to be checked on.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  Thanks, I remember now.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  I remember it's exactly a piece of equipment and something that needs to be turned off.
[26:35.000 --> 26:36.000]  I did hit snooze.
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  We'll turn it off at the end of the show.
[26:38.000 --> 26:39.000]  Not a great big deal.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  Shout out to alarms for reminding us not to destroy our gardens.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  What up technology?
[26:43.000 --> 26:44.000]  How are you doing?
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  Yeah.
[26:45.000 --> 26:49.000]  So a quick reminder for the listeners.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  Don't tell anybody about your grow.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  Nobody.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Even if it's in a legal state, you should probably shut up about it.
[26:54.000 --> 26:55.000]  Yes.
[26:55.000 --> 26:56.000]  People still want to steal it.
[26:56.000 --> 26:58.000]  People still want to be vindictive.
[26:58.000 --> 26:59.000]  People still are haters.
[26:59.000 --> 27:06.000]  I don't know what's wrong with society these days, but no matter how well you do, how hard you try, someone is going to hate you for it.
[27:06.000 --> 27:08.000]  Exes always want to fuck your shit up.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  If you were selling hats and kitten posters, they'd be telling their friends that your shit's terrible.
[27:12.000 --> 27:13.000]  Yeah.
[27:13.000 --> 27:14.000]  Like they just want to bring you down.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  If it's a cannabis grow, it's just easier for them.
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  Very true.
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.000]  And man, I can't tell you how many gardens I've seen or helped people move from one place to another in the middle of the night because they just broke up with so and so.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  Allegedly.
[27:28.000 --> 27:29.000]  And they threatened to so and so.
[27:29.000 --> 27:30.000]  Allegedly.
[27:30.000 --> 27:31.000]  Yep.
[27:31.000 --> 27:32.000]  That was a long fucking time ago.
[27:32.000 --> 27:33.000]  Fucking bring it.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  Fucking bring it.
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.000]  If you could still find my footprints in that mud behind that house in the dark where we moved that light, bring it.
[27:40.000 --> 27:53.000]  One of my favorite memories of legal cannabis, we were trimming an outdoor grow at a friend's house and multiple police officers came up through the back gate area because he lived, his back gate had an alley and then it was the back gate.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  Multiple law enforcement officers came up, casually walking up and there was a crime that had happened in the area.
[27:59.000 --> 28:00.000]  And they're like, Hey, did you guys see this person?
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  And we're like, Oh, I know him.
[28:01.000 --> 28:02.000]  Haven't seen him.
[28:02.000 --> 28:03.000]  And they're like, okay.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  And then they said, you guys have a lot of cannabis here.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  And I said, I've got a medical marijuana card.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  And the cop slowly turned his head from person to person.
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  Just like you.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  Yeah, I got a cannabis card too.
[28:12.000 --> 28:13.000]  You, yeah, card.
[28:13.000 --> 28:14.000]  You, yeah, card.
[28:14.000 --> 28:15.000]  And this was before recreational.
[28:15.000 --> 28:16.000]  This is all medical.
[28:16.000 --> 28:17.000]  We got lucky.
[28:17.000 --> 28:27.000]  They were looking for a serious felon and we were at a point where the cops knew that checking our paperwork would take a very long time of their day.
[28:27.000 --> 28:32.000]  There were probably eight to 10 of us out there just trimming, sitting on picnic tables in the backyard.
[28:32.000 --> 28:37.000]  The warrant squad had wandered up the alley and noticed that a half dozen people were trimming weed in the backyard.
[28:37.000 --> 28:38.000]  Buddy's wife was out there.
[28:38.000 --> 28:39.000]  Christmas trees.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  She was cooking food in the backyard and he was out there entertaining us.
[28:42.000 --> 28:45.000]  Yeah, the dogs are running around and here come law enforcement officers.
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  Just like, Hey guys, did you happen to see this person?
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  We're like, oh, that's, that's a neighborhood guy.
[28:49.000 --> 28:50.000]  We know who he is now.
[28:50.000 --> 28:51.000]  He didn't come through here.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  And they're like, okay, um, who's got a medical marijuana card?
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  And I was like, I've got a medical marijuana card.
[28:56.000 --> 29:00.000]  And he just went around the circle and they kind of looked at each other like, well, they've got cards.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  Have a good day guys.
[29:01.000 --> 29:02.000]  And they left us alone.
[29:02.000 --> 29:03.000]  They never came back.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  They never bugged us, but that was a summer outdoor medical harvest.
[29:06.000 --> 29:13.000]  That was before the rules were so gray that it was more of a pain in the ass to come bust us because then you'd go to court and they'd go, well, what rule did they break?
[29:13.000 --> 29:14.000]  They have medical marijuana plants.
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  They'd go, we don't know, but they have weed plants.
[29:16.000 --> 29:18.000]  It's gotta be illegal.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  And there was just no clear line at that point.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  So there was a lot of fun when it was all gray area.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  Yeah.
[29:24.000 --> 29:26.000]  If you're in one of those gray area, wild, wild west is what we called it.
[29:26.000 --> 29:30.000]  Get it on while you get it while you can, because it will not last forever.
[29:30.000 --> 29:37.000]  So first it comes the start of a normalization, legalization, regulation is what I'm thinking of that comes.
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  Then it, then it tightens up and then it tightens up and it tightens up.
[29:40.000 --> 29:52.000]  If you, if you're in a state where it's just kicking on and you get in early, start socking money away for equipment, changeovers and regulation changes that cost you random money out of nowhere.
[29:52.000 --> 29:53.000]  Absolutely.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  I remember the edible companies here freaked when everything had to be stamped.
[29:57.000 --> 30:00.000]  It's every edible company had to buy all new molds like overnight.
[30:00.000 --> 30:02.000]  This is a real thing.
[30:02.000 --> 30:03.000]  Be ready for it.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  Be prepared for the future.
[30:05.000 --> 30:06.000]  Be ready.
[30:06.000 --> 30:10.000]  All right, Mike, before we start wrapping up the podcast, I think it was a pretty good show.
[30:10.000 --> 30:12.000]  Keep it short and tight here.
[30:12.000 --> 30:13.000]  It was a Thursday episode.
[30:13.000 --> 30:14.000]  Followed a little short.
[30:14.000 --> 30:19.000]  I try to keep this show on track so hard.
[30:19.000 --> 30:22.000]  Sometimes you invited me over to do a fun email show.
[30:23.000 --> 30:29.000]  I was going to ask if you had any things to say before we start wrapping up the podcast, but I kind of just want to turn off your mic and do the closing part by myself.
[30:29.000 --> 30:37.000]  Questions, comments, concerns, hey male is at Nemo Punk 15 on Twitter or Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[30:37.000 --> 30:39.000]  Can hit me up on any of those.
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  I usually respond.
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  There you go.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.000]  Friendly.
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  He's friendly.
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  Yeah.
[30:44.000 --> 30:45.000]  Send him some messages.
[30:45.000 --> 30:46.000]  Let him know that you hear about him on the show.
[30:46.000 --> 30:50.000]  It's always nice to get emails and see comments on YouTube that say shout out to white Mike.
[30:50.000 --> 30:53.000]  So big, big thanks for all the contact and support for white Mike.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  Make sure you follow him on the Twitter.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  Again, it's Nemo Punk 15.
