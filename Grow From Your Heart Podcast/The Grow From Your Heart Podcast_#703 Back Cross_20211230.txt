[02:37.450 --> 02:38.650]  That's all the rambling at the start of the show.
[02:38.650 --> 02:41.970]  Let's get into the email portion of this podcast.
[02:41.970 --> 02:43.690]  I do have a great question here right in front of me.
[02:44.450 --> 02:49.290]  It came from our friend Something Different and it goes a little bit just like this.
[02:49.290 --> 02:51.650]  It says, hey, Rasta Jeff, what's going on?
[02:51.650 --> 02:53.850]  I hope all is well.
[02:53.850 --> 02:54.850]  Everything is iry.
[02:54.850 --> 02:55.850]  Thank you for asking.
[02:55.850 --> 02:58.810]  I hope things are well in your life, your garden, whatever you've got going on.
[02:58.810 --> 03:00.010]  I hope it is all well for you.
[03:00.010 --> 03:01.790]  I hope you had a good holiday.
[03:01.790 --> 03:02.790]  It goes on.
[03:02.790 --> 03:04.730]  It does say, quick breeding question.
[03:04.730 --> 03:07.450]  Those are some of my favorites.
[03:07.450 --> 03:09.130]  The question goes a little bit like this.
[03:09.130 --> 03:14.570]  It says, what is the difference between BX and F1, F2, et cetera?
[03:14.570 --> 03:16.610]  What are the benefits of doing a BX?
[03:16.610 --> 03:20.850]  I don't know why, but I just can't grasp the concept of backcrossing.
[03:20.850 --> 03:23.290]  When he says BX in this, it does mean backcross.
[03:23.290 --> 03:25.610]  It can be indicated as BX or BC.
[03:25.610 --> 03:26.610]  Maybe I should touch on that.
[03:26.610 --> 03:30.570]  It says, I don't understand the concept of backcrossing.
[03:30.570 --> 03:34.210]  You have a way of explaining things for a broad audience, so I'm hoping you'd be able
[03:34.210 --> 03:35.290]  to help out.
[03:35.290 --> 03:40.450]  Keep doing what you do and to stay iry from some ... How did you write that?
[03:40.450 --> 03:41.450]  Something different.
[03:41.450 --> 03:43.370]  Big shout out to our buddy, Something Different.
[03:43.370 --> 03:47.530]  Thank you for noticing that I have a way of teaching that a lot of people can absorb the
[03:47.530 --> 03:48.530]  information.
[03:48.530 --> 03:49.530]  That means a lot to me.
[03:49.530 --> 03:51.610]  That's one of my main focuses and goals.
[03:51.610 --> 03:56.250]  People say that I ramble and repeat myself, but I understand that people learn in different
[03:56.250 --> 04:00.690]  ways and I want to make sure that everybody follows along, so thank you for noticing that.
[04:00.690 --> 04:04.330]  Let's talk about this concept of a backcross.
[04:04.330 --> 04:07.530]  A good place to start is, why would we want a backcross?
[04:07.530 --> 04:08.530]  What is the point?
[04:08.530 --> 04:09.530]  What's the purpose?
[04:09.530 --> 04:10.530]  Why are we doing this?
[04:10.530 --> 04:12.330]  Why would somebody want to make a backcross?
[04:12.330 --> 04:17.050]  That will help us understand why, and then that will also help me explain how and again
[04:17.050 --> 04:18.510]  why it happens.
[04:18.510 --> 04:20.690]  Let's talk a little bit about a backcross here.
[04:20.690 --> 04:25.730]  A very common and practical reason for making backcrosses is maybe you've got a female plant
[04:25.730 --> 04:31.210]  that you want to put into seed form, but you do not have a male of that same plant.
[04:31.210 --> 04:33.690]  You've got the female, you grow it, you know it's awesome.
[04:33.690 --> 04:35.690]  It makes amazing buds, amazing flowers.
[04:35.690 --> 04:37.690]  It's got all the qualities you would want.
[04:37.690 --> 04:42.590]  You want to put that in seed form, but you don't have a male plant of the same plant.
[04:42.590 --> 04:46.050]  If we were going to use a different plant, that is not a backcross.
[04:46.050 --> 04:49.050]  We would be adulterating the original mix.
[04:49.050 --> 04:50.810]  You could make an S1.
[04:50.810 --> 04:54.650]  You could make a feminized plant out of this plant and not adulterate it.
[04:54.650 --> 04:59.450]  However, many growers, many people do not prefer feminized plants.
[04:59.450 --> 05:02.210]  Many people think there's something wrong with the fem seed.
[05:02.210 --> 05:03.370]  Many people just don't like it.
[05:03.370 --> 05:04.730]  There's a lot of reasons why.
[05:04.730 --> 05:07.770]  A lot of it is myth and misconception and miseducation.
[05:07.770 --> 05:11.650]  That's not what we're here for today, but a lot of people don't want the fems.
[05:11.650 --> 05:17.050]  So instead of getting a feminized seed, our next solution is to create a backcross.
[05:17.050 --> 05:21.250]  A very good example that I can talk to you about backcross and use very well as a teaching
[05:21.250 --> 05:25.690]  guideline because I've done this is the golden goat backcross.
[05:25.690 --> 05:28.130]  Now let's talk a little bit about the golden goat backcross.
[05:28.130 --> 05:31.470]  I've been making golden goat feminized seeds for quite a while.
[05:31.470 --> 05:32.810]  They sell like hotcakes.
[05:32.810 --> 05:36.730]  Many people, however, have requested something different and they don't want the fems, but
[05:36.730 --> 05:38.050]  they do want the golden goat.
[05:38.050 --> 05:40.850]  That inspired me to make the golden goat backcross.
[05:40.850 --> 05:42.610]  How did I go about doing this?
[05:42.610 --> 05:46.190]  I've got the original golden goat female, so that's a good solid start.
[05:46.190 --> 05:48.450]  That's what we need to make a backcross.
[05:48.450 --> 05:51.170]  Golden goat is what is known as a clone only.
[05:51.210 --> 05:54.490]  The original breeder never put out seeds of the golden goat.
[05:54.490 --> 05:59.490]  So the only plant that is available from that batch of seeds is the one keeper clone of
[05:59.490 --> 06:01.850]  the golden goat, and that's what I have got.
[06:01.850 --> 06:04.690]  Now I want to make seeds of the golden goat.
[06:04.690 --> 06:08.850]  The first step is to find a male plant to pollinate that golden goat.
[06:08.850 --> 06:11.210]  I need to make some seeds to start with.
[06:11.210 --> 06:12.690]  Now how do I do this?
[06:12.690 --> 06:20.090]  My approach was to find a male that was drastically different in all ways from the golden goat
[06:20.090 --> 06:21.090]  plant.
[06:21.130 --> 06:27.490]  The golden goat had sharp, pointy, serrated, skinny leaves and grew kind of tall.
[06:27.490 --> 06:29.170]  It's got a tall yet compact structure.
[06:29.170 --> 06:32.050]  I know that's kind of redundant, but when you see the plant and you grow it, you'll
[06:32.050 --> 06:33.410]  understand.
[06:33.410 --> 06:35.370]  It's a big plant, but it stays compact.
[06:35.370 --> 06:36.370]  It's stout.
[06:36.370 --> 06:37.530]  It can support itself.
[06:37.530 --> 06:39.290]  It's got a nice bud structure.
[06:39.290 --> 06:41.130]  So I know the shape of that plant very well.
[06:41.130 --> 06:42.130]  I know what I'm looking for.
[06:42.130 --> 06:44.050]  It's got the skinnier, longer leaves.
[06:44.050 --> 06:49.930]  I took another plant that was a male plant and it had gigantic, wide, fat leaves and
[06:49.930 --> 06:52.610]  it grew real stretchy and real branchy.
[06:52.610 --> 06:54.810]  I was real OG Kush dominant.
[06:54.810 --> 06:58.890]  So I could see visually the complete differences in these plants.
[06:58.890 --> 07:02.490]  If you went in the grow room and pulled a leaf off of the golden goat and pulled a leaf
[07:02.490 --> 07:06.970]  off of the daybreaker anywhere in the room and brought them out, I could tell you that's
[07:06.970 --> 07:08.810]  daybreaker, that is golden goat.
[07:08.810 --> 07:14.090]  So I chose a daybreaker male that was vastly different from the golden goat in every way,
[07:14.090 --> 07:15.330]  shape, and form.
[07:15.330 --> 07:17.330]  I took that daybreaker male pollen.
[07:17.330 --> 07:20.210]  I applied that to the female golden goat plant.
[07:20.210 --> 07:23.010]  Now I've made, it is kind of an F1.
[07:23.010 --> 07:24.010]  It's more of a polyhybrid.
[07:24.010 --> 07:27.370]  In this case, we're just going to say that that is an F1.
[07:27.370 --> 07:29.050]  That is what made Arise.
[07:29.050 --> 07:31.970]  So from that cross resulted the Arise F1.
[07:31.970 --> 07:36.090]  Arise is a golden goat female pollinated by the daybreaker male.
[07:36.090 --> 07:39.570]  I found a male plant out of there that is not King Solomon.
[07:39.570 --> 07:40.890]  It is a different male.
[07:40.890 --> 07:47.270]  I found a male plant out of there that very closely mirrors the original golden goat plant.
[07:48.210 --> 07:52.350]  So I took a male plant that is not golden goat, pollinated the original golden goat.
[07:52.350 --> 07:53.710]  I grew those seeds.
[07:53.710 --> 08:00.350]  I found a male that looks identical, if not a twin, if not a mirror of the original golden
[08:00.350 --> 08:01.350]  goat female.
[08:01.350 --> 08:04.590]  So now I've got a male that looks just like my golden goat.
[08:04.590 --> 08:08.870]  I'm now going to use that male to pollinate my golden goat female.
[08:08.870 --> 08:11.070]  That is now my original bat cross one.
[08:11.070 --> 08:12.890]  Why is it a bat cross?
[08:13.210 --> 08:17.970]  I took that plant and I pollinated something with it and I created seeds.
[08:17.970 --> 08:21.130]  Then I took that seed and put it back on the mom.
[08:21.130 --> 08:23.210]  We have bat crossed it to the mom.
[08:23.210 --> 08:26.050]  What I'm trying to do here, think about it like ingredients.
[08:26.050 --> 08:28.790]  You've got, let's think of it as a dollar bill.
[08:28.790 --> 08:34.210]  When I started with this dollar bill, I tore it in half and I had 50 cents that were daybreaker
[08:34.210 --> 08:36.710]  and 50 cents that were golden goat.
[08:36.710 --> 08:39.870]  So now that is 50 cents golden goat, 50 cents daybreaker.
[08:39.870 --> 08:44.190]  Now I'm going to put that back onto the original golden goat.
[08:44.190 --> 08:47.990]  So now I've got, let's say probably 75%.
[08:47.990 --> 08:49.230]  We're going to put more golden goat.
[08:49.230 --> 08:52.890]  We got to take out a quarter out of my dollar, put more of the golden goat back in there.
[08:52.890 --> 08:58.170]  We've got 75% golden goat traits in that first run of the bat cross.
[08:58.170 --> 09:02.230]  This is what we're going to call back cross one.
[09:02.230 --> 09:04.390]  It is labeled BX1.
[09:04.390 --> 09:06.510]  My friend Pete's head just exploded.
[09:06.510 --> 09:09.330]  It should be labeled BC1.
[09:09.330 --> 09:10.330]  We're saying bat cross.
[09:10.330 --> 09:12.210]  You don't spell cross with an X.
[09:12.210 --> 09:16.690]  I got the bat cross because when we list genetics, we like to put that X in there.
[09:16.690 --> 09:20.290]  Somehow it became a multiplication table, but we like to put that X in there.
[09:20.290 --> 09:25.630]  So we're just saying, we often say like a golden goat cross two daybreaker.
[09:25.630 --> 09:30.090]  So we're just saying back cross is what the X represents, BX, bat cross.
[09:30.090 --> 09:35.310]  So I think I explained that generally how the bat cross one would happen.
[09:35.310 --> 09:40.150]  You find a male plant that is vastly different from your female plant.
[09:40.150 --> 09:42.510]  Pollinate, then you will make seeds.
[09:42.510 --> 09:44.930]  From those seeds, find a male plant.
[09:44.930 --> 09:50.190]  Take the pollen from that male plant and put it back on the original mommy plant.
[09:50.190 --> 09:56.230]  If you did this correctly, at least 75% of your progeny should look very similar to the
[09:56.230 --> 09:58.470]  original golden goat.
[09:58.470 --> 10:01.470]  Now our next step is to take those seeds.
[10:01.470 --> 10:05.010]  We've now taken, so you took your daybreaker, pollinated golden goat.
[10:05.710 --> 10:06.710]  You made seeds.
[10:06.710 --> 10:08.570]  You found a male that looks just like golden goat.
[10:08.570 --> 10:13.130]  I went so far as to pull the leaves off of each plant and rest them up on top of each
[10:13.130 --> 10:15.410]  other and count the serrations of the leaves.
[10:15.410 --> 10:17.850]  I was rubbing the stems and smelling this hand.
[10:17.850 --> 10:19.170]  I was touching the female plant.
[10:19.170 --> 10:22.450]  This hand I was touching the male plants and smelling for golden goat traits.
[10:22.450 --> 10:24.330]  I found a mirror of the golden goat.
[10:24.330 --> 10:26.970]  So I took that pollen, pollinated the golden goat.
[10:26.970 --> 10:29.970]  That made the first round of bat cross seeds.
[10:29.970 --> 10:34.530]  From those seeds, I will find another male that looks just like the golden goat again
[10:34.730 --> 10:37.490]  and put it back on that original golden goat mommy.
[10:37.490 --> 10:42.450]  Now at this point, we're just trying to wash out the daybreaker traits and solidify that
[10:42.450 --> 10:44.050]  golden goat trait.
[10:44.050 --> 10:49.370]  Every time I do the bat cross, if I select my new male plants correctly, we will get
[10:49.370 --> 10:52.570]  closer and closer to stabilizing that golden goat trait.
[10:52.570 --> 10:56.850]  It will be all golden goat the more we do it, if we do it correctly.
[10:56.850 --> 10:59.450]  It's all about selecting that male properly.
[10:59.450 --> 11:02.890]  We know that the female golden goat is exactly what we want.
[11:02.930 --> 11:05.250]  We introduced the daybreaker on the first run.
[11:05.250 --> 11:09.530]  Now we're trying to wash the daybreaker out and all of the subsequent breeding crosses.
[11:09.530 --> 11:11.650]  The first one is BX1.
[11:11.650 --> 11:14.850]  The second one is going to be BX2 and so forth.
[11:14.850 --> 11:18.090]  Every time, so you're going to take the male plant, pollinate, make seeds.
[11:18.090 --> 11:20.530]  Then you're going to take the seed and put it back to the mom.
[11:20.530 --> 11:24.530]  Then make more seeds and then put that seed back to the mom and that seed back to the mom.
[11:24.530 --> 11:27.110]  Every time you do it, the bat cross number just goes up.
[11:27.110 --> 11:31.690]  By the time you get to the third, fourth, at least, hopefully by the fifth bat cross,
[11:31.690 --> 11:32.970]  they should be quite stable.
[11:32.970 --> 11:35.690]  Now let's talk a little bit about the word stable.
[11:35.690 --> 11:40.570]  I see a lot of people miss using the word stable and stability when it comes to cannabis,
[11:40.570 --> 11:43.010]  when it comes to breeding plants at all.
[11:43.010 --> 11:47.490]  Stability doesn't necessarily mean that the plants have intersex traits.
[11:47.490 --> 11:52.490]  Stability means that you're going to see uniformity amongst a population.
[11:52.490 --> 11:57.970]  If we plant 100 seeds, stability means that 100 of them are going to look quite similar.
[11:57.970 --> 12:00.010]  Excuse me for the throat drag there.
[12:00.090 --> 12:04.130]  If we plant 100 seeds, at least 75 to 80 to 90% of them,
[12:04.130 --> 12:07.410]  depending on which filial generation we are in, should look similar.
[12:07.410 --> 12:09.970]  That's what we're talking about when it comes to stability.
[12:09.970 --> 12:12.570]  I see people say it hermed because it wasn't stable.
[12:12.570 --> 12:14.250]  No, it was an intersex plant.
[12:14.250 --> 12:15.930]  It had nothing to do with stability.
[12:15.930 --> 12:20.090]  It was intersex and that intersex trait could be stabilized.
[12:20.090 --> 12:22.570]  You could make that a trait that pops up if you want.
[12:22.570 --> 12:23.810]  You wouldn't want to do that.
[12:23.810 --> 12:27.090]  But we are using the word stable and stability quite wrong,
[12:27.130 --> 12:29.570]  oftentimes in the cannabis industry.
[12:29.570 --> 12:31.770]  Just trying to drop a little knowledge nugget there.
[12:31.770 --> 12:33.650]  I think I explained bat cross.
[12:33.650 --> 12:36.490]  The purpose for bat cross is we want to make seeds of a plant
[12:36.490 --> 12:38.330]  which we don't have a male of.
[12:38.330 --> 12:41.090]  So if you were to pollinate the golden goat with the daybreaker,
[12:41.090 --> 12:42.610]  that is not golden goat.
[12:42.610 --> 12:44.410]  That is golden goat to daybreaker.
[12:44.410 --> 12:47.410]  So now we're going to find a seed of that that looks like golden goat,
[12:47.410 --> 12:49.170]  hit that to the golden goat again.
[12:49.170 --> 12:50.490]  That's going to give us more seeds.
[12:50.490 --> 12:52.490]  We're going to find one that looks like golden goat,
[12:52.490 --> 12:53.530]  hit that golden goat again.
[12:53.530 --> 12:58.050]  You can go as long as you want until those plants look just like golden goat.
[12:58.050 --> 12:59.290]  You don't have to stop.
[12:59.290 --> 13:02.370]  It could be a lifelong project, keep going forever.
[13:02.370 --> 13:05.730]  That is basically how the bat cross happens.
[13:05.730 --> 13:07.450]  Part of this question was,
[13:07.450 --> 13:11.650]  what's the difference between an F1 and an F2 and a bat cross?
[13:11.650 --> 13:17.650]  An F1 is if we were to use two heterozygous plants,
[13:17.650 --> 13:19.050]  so golden goat and daybreaker,
[13:19.050 --> 13:21.850]  when we cross those, that brand new cross,
[13:21.850 --> 13:25.250]  that thing that's never been made before from two very different parents,
[13:25.250 --> 13:26.290]  that is an F1.
[13:26.290 --> 13:29.290]  The first time we make that, that's an F1.
[13:29.290 --> 13:31.770]  If we take, so we made that F1,
[13:31.770 --> 13:35.810]  then we find a male and a female from that seed batch and cross those,
[13:35.810 --> 13:37.170]  that is when we make an F2.
[13:37.170 --> 13:41.450]  Then we find a male and a female from that seed batch and make F3.
[13:41.450 --> 13:44.050]  So if they're brothers and sisters and you're crossing them,
[13:44.050 --> 13:45.610]  you are making a filial generation.
[13:45.610 --> 13:46.930]  That is acceptable with plants.
[13:46.930 --> 13:49.450]  Don't do that in your house.
[13:49.450 --> 13:50.010]  Where was I?
[13:50.010 --> 13:53.610]  I was talking about the golden goat and trying not to adulterate the golden goat.
[13:53.610 --> 13:56.090]  If we pollinate the golden goat with the daybreaker,
[13:56.090 --> 13:57.610]  now we have adulterated it.
[13:57.610 --> 14:02.930]  Now we've got to bat cross it to itself again multiple times to wash out that daybreaker trait.
[14:02.930 --> 14:04.850]  We're just trying to get rid of all the traits,
[14:04.850 --> 14:06.770]  all the signs that daybreaker was in there.
[14:06.770 --> 14:11.290]  Then we've got as close to golden goat as we can get without selfing it,
[14:11.290 --> 14:16.250]  without having a male to replicate it to make the F2 or a further generation.
[14:16.250 --> 14:17.570]  There are other ways to do it.
[14:17.570 --> 14:19.330]  There's another reason why this is viable.
[14:19.330 --> 14:25.010]  Sometimes you'll find a seed in a bag of weed and people always hope that it's female.
[14:25.010 --> 14:28.770]  Sometimes if I find a seed in a bag of weed, I hope that fucker's a male.
[14:28.770 --> 14:31.330]  I can do a lot more things with a male than I can a female.
[14:31.330 --> 14:33.370]  I can only do one thing with a female.
[14:33.370 --> 14:35.650]  It can basically get pollinated by some boys.
[14:35.650 --> 14:40.570]  I can pollinate a bunch of females if I find a boy and I can see what that male does.
[14:40.570 --> 14:42.250]  Maybe we can create some new shit.
[14:42.250 --> 14:44.370]  Anyway, I am rambling.
[14:44.370 --> 14:46.890]  I think I've explained F1 a little bit.
[14:46.890 --> 14:48.330]  I've explained F2 a little bit.
[14:48.330 --> 14:51.410]  I feel like I definitely explained bat cross.
[14:51.410 --> 14:54.290]  Let me check my notes, see if I have anything else left here.
[14:54.290 --> 14:57.730]  Two heterozygous parents make an F1.
[14:57.730 --> 14:58.690]  Those are called P1s.
[14:58.690 --> 15:00.570]  Parents are P1.
[15:00.570 --> 15:03.490]  You cross your F1s to make your F2s.
[15:03.490 --> 15:06.130]  You can take a plant and create bat crosses.
[15:06.130 --> 15:09.130]  All right, I think I've made enough rambling at the end of this show.
[15:09.130 --> 15:10.490]  This is going to be a quick episode.
[15:10.490 --> 15:14.130]  Again, we're right at the Christmas taint, the Christmas New Year's taint.
[15:14.130 --> 15:14.890]  It taint Christmas.
[15:14.890 --> 15:16.170]  It taint New Year's.
[15:16.170 --> 15:17.810]  It's time to settle in for the New Year.
[15:17.810 --> 15:19.050]  This is going to be a quick show.
[15:19.050 --> 15:20.250]  Hope everybody enjoyed this one.
[15:20.250 --> 15:21.610]  I hope you learned something.

[15:34.810 --> 15:38.010]  Set some goals, crush those goals.
[15:38.010 --> 15:39.250]  That's really all I've got for you.
[15:39.250 --> 15:40.090]  Thank you, guys.
