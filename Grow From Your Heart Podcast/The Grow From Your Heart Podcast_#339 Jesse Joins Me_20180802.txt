[01:17.280 --> 01:22.200]  have been pretty good I've been loving your pictures your your Mexico pictures
[01:22.200 --> 01:25.760]  your garden pictures from other places those are very entertaining to me thank
[01:25.800 --> 01:30.360]  you thank you dude congrats on the adventures and on the anniversary yeah
[01:30.360 --> 01:35.120]  thank you yeah it's just four years nice nice shout out to the shout out to the
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.880]  wife for letting you come play for a little while so we've been hanging out
[01:38.880 --> 01:41.520]  bullshit and we took a bunch of dabs guys so you'll have to excuse the
[01:41.520 --> 01:44.440]  slowness that will wear off eventually hopefully and then as soon as it does
[01:44.440 --> 01:48.320]  we're gonna take more dabs but uh I wanted to bring Jesse on because
[01:48.320 --> 01:52.920]  somebody asked me a very interesting question and I tried to politely not
[01:52.920 --> 01:55.760]  laugh at them when they asked but it kind of made me giggle a little bit
[01:55.760 --> 01:59.560]  there were a lot of things that I was like oh this guy then I thought I'd talk
[01:59.560 --> 02:04.760]  about on the show with Jesse somebody asked me why is it so hard to grow
[02:04.760 --> 02:09.800]  indoors when it just happens naturally outdoors and that sparked a lot of
[02:09.800 --> 02:14.120]  thoughts in my head Jesse looks like he's already got stuff to say let it go
[02:14.120 --> 02:18.280]  bro looks like you want to launch something off no man it's been so long I
[02:18.280 --> 02:25.520]  forgot how to podcast for sure for sure nothing is easier to grow inside nothing
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.840]  you're trying to recreate a natural environment and even in a harsh
[02:30.840 --> 02:36.880]  environment it's still a harsh outdoor desert environment I don't know why I'm
[02:36.880 --> 02:45.240]  assuming desert but it's still gonna be harder what am I trying to say even that
[02:45.240 --> 02:50.280]  is more loving to a plant than a rough indoor environment that's not getting
[02:50.280 --> 02:54.680]  fresh air has hot lights being down on it the thing I really thought you were
[02:54.680 --> 02:58.680]  gonna laugh at is that they actually thought it was easy to grow outdoors I
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.160]  think people think we can just throw a seed out there and pour some water on it
[03:03.160 --> 03:08.080]  and hope that we have good buds at the end of the season for sure I understand
[03:08.080 --> 03:13.960]  you know the the notion though that it is a little easier you know you don't
[03:14.120 --> 03:18.680]  you're not trying to balance environmental differences you know so
[03:18.680 --> 03:25.560]  but yeah still definitely not easy you know unless you live somewhere where it
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.040]  rains about an inch a week time and then it dries out in the fall and you don't
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.080]  have any humidity and you know you have dark deep beautiful soil so like maybe
[03:35.080 --> 03:38.200]  Hawaii yeah I was gonna say Hawaii is about the only place for that so if
[03:38.200 --> 03:41.280]  we're gonna grow outdoors we've got to be out there every morning we've got to
[03:41.280 --> 03:45.080]  supply water if there's not water being supplied for sure we got to put water on
[03:45.080 --> 03:48.040]  it we have to protect it from the elements if we don't have some sort of
[03:48.040 --> 03:53.000]  cover out there we have to prevent bugs we have to do all of the maintenance it
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.840]  is not as easy as a lot of people would like to think it is to grow outdoors no
[03:57.840 --> 04:05.640]  no yeah everything you said your arms are huge you're fucking sunburned your
[04:05.640 --> 04:10.440]  hats got a sweat line on it you are a physical description a depiction of what
[04:10.440 --> 04:15.840]  an outdoor grower looks like I feel that I've definitely stepped it up to I
[04:15.840 --> 04:19.840]  probably call myself a farmer now I would agree with that you've got that
[04:19.840 --> 04:25.400]  farmer tan going on for sure but so it's not as easy to grow outdoors as some
[04:25.400 --> 04:28.840]  people would like to think so when our friend said why is it so easy to grow
[04:28.840 --> 04:31.880]  outdoors why is it so hard indoors when it happens so easily outdoors my first
[04:31.880 --> 04:35.680]  thing was like oh this dude thinks it's easy to grow outdoors like I'm glad he
[04:35.680 --> 04:40.240]  didn't say that in front of Jesse so it's not that easy to grow outdoors you
[04:40.240 --> 04:44.160]  have to you have to dig holes you have to put or at least fill giant pots and
[04:44.160 --> 04:47.480]  you've got plants out there in the heat which means they're thirsty which means
[04:47.480 --> 04:51.080]  you're out there in the heat giving them a drink you're getting sweaty like
[04:51.080 --> 04:55.800]  you're hauling water you're tending irrigation systems you know whatever it
[04:55.800 --> 05:00.880]  is moving the dirt top dressing plants mixing feed you know how you do your
[05:00.880 --> 05:07.540]  thing thinning of the plants throughout the season topping trellising you know a
[05:07.900 --> 05:13.220]  lot of the work is identical to what you do inside you know so but it's outdoors
[05:13.220 --> 05:17.460]  in the damn heat yeah yeah yeah and that makes a huge difference and then you've
[05:17.460 --> 05:20.340]  got elements to deal with maybe it's gonna rain this morning maybe it's gonna
[05:20.340 --> 05:25.740]  rain late tonight it's Colorado it has been straight-up hail season season yeah
[05:25.740 --> 05:31.460]  I've seen a few farms vegetable and cannabis completely wiped out this year
[05:31.460 --> 05:34.900]  Wow yeah I would be surprised I mean just completely fucking wiped out
[05:34.900 --> 05:38.860]  nothing left it's also powdery mildew season outdoors right now it is hot as
[05:38.860 --> 05:42.980]  shit during the day and moist as shit at night it is beautifully conditioned for
[05:42.980 --> 05:46.500]  powdery mildew right there so that's that's my first side of the coin is it
[05:46.500 --> 05:51.140]  is really not that easy to grow outdoors it's a lot of challenges there are a lot
[05:51.140 --> 05:54.940]  of challenges yes the light is free but the heat is excessive and you have to
[05:54.940 --> 05:58.460]  water and you have to go out there and do it so you have to be out there in the
[05:58.460 --> 06:02.780]  heat it's not as easy as one might think so now let's talk about why indoors is
[06:03.140 --> 06:09.220]  such a challenge we're trying to bring all of that stuff outside into a room
[06:09.220 --> 06:13.180]  let's just say most people are gonna pick a bedroom in their house probably a
[06:13.180 --> 06:16.660]  basement maybe an attic those are the classic places you go so you've chosen a
[06:16.660 --> 06:21.180]  bedroom right hang up a couple lights that's always the first step right hang
[06:21.180 --> 06:26.940]  up a couple of lights yeah yeah yeah hang up a couple of lights you plug them
[06:26.940 --> 06:31.460]  in what's the first thing that's gonna happen gets hot as hell gets hot as hell
[06:31.460 --> 06:36.060]  in that room it's gonna run up to 90 110 degrees pretty quickly if you got a
[06:36.060 --> 06:40.140]  thousand watt light going on in there and there is zero air exchange zero air
[06:40.140 --> 06:45.540]  now now we got to get some air out and some air in so now we've we've got the
[06:45.540 --> 06:48.260]  light that's what the plants want but now we're heating it up now the plants
[06:48.260 --> 06:51.580]  are just roasting in there now we've just created basically a little oven
[06:51.580 --> 06:55.300]  we're just putting Auschwitz plants in there so now you got it no you got
[06:55.300 --> 06:58.780]  either put cooling or some sort of airflow so now you're adding another
[06:58.780 --> 07:03.100]  piece of equipment let's say we decided to put let's put a blower in there to
[07:03.100 --> 07:07.100]  remove some of that air and pull in some fresh air now it stinks now you got to
[07:07.100 --> 07:10.140]  add a carbon filter because that air is blowing out to the neighbors the
[07:10.140 --> 07:13.460]  neighbors are gonna smell your crop that's still not cooling enough now we
[07:13.460 --> 07:18.100]  need to add an air conditioner every time you start adding something the
[07:18.100 --> 07:21.900]  power is gonna need to be pull DB more efficient so now you're gonna need to
[07:21.900 --> 07:27.740]  upgrade the power if that's why it's not so easy indoors every time you add one
[07:27.820 --> 07:31.500]  element you're gonna add heat you're gonna add something so now we've got
[07:31.500 --> 07:34.700]  lights in there we've got some air conditioning going we've got a little
[07:34.700 --> 07:37.820]  bit of a blower what's gonna happen the first time we water those plants
[07:37.820 --> 07:42.100]  humidity's gonna spike humidity is gonna go crazy and so now we got to add a
[07:42.100 --> 07:47.980]  dehumidifier now that the humidifier wait where'd this water come from oh
[07:47.980 --> 07:52.060]  exactly yeah yeah now we got to figure out where to get all this water and we
[07:52.060 --> 07:56.220]  spilled some of it yeah yeah and where's it gonna go yeah where's it gonna go do
[07:56.220 --> 08:00.260]  you have a floor drain or you did a lot of it's gonna become humidity yeah yeah
[08:00.260 --> 08:03.900]  yeah a lot but the plants are gonna suck up a lot of it we're gonna spill some on
[08:03.900 --> 08:06.340]  the floor they're gonna run out of the bottom of the plants do you have a floor
[08:06.340 --> 08:09.700]  drain do you have a bunch of saucers are you gonna be shot backing that out or
[08:09.700 --> 08:13.820]  are you gonna dump the shot back yeah outside there's poor water on those
[08:13.820 --> 08:18.780]  motherfuckers the ground doesn't think nature makes it happen for sure so I
[08:18.780 --> 08:24.460]  mean like I said I can definitely see you know why someone would think growing
[08:24.460 --> 08:30.060]  outdoors is easier than indoors so but at the same time you know and as an
[08:30.060 --> 08:34.860]  indoor grower I I totally feel that it is a struggle the whole entire season
[08:34.860 --> 08:39.660]  outdoors because it's so unpredictable for me it is okay as an outdoor grower
[08:39.660 --> 08:43.100]  you have the same vibe oh yeah you wake up and you walk out there and go what
[08:43.100 --> 08:48.300]  the fuck went up Ron overnight like normally we get pretty good rains in the
[08:48.300 --> 08:53.500]  in the spring and we did not get those this year yeah most of July has been
[08:53.500 --> 09:00.220]  just incredibly fucking hot and fuck we went what six weeks without any
[09:00.220 --> 09:07.900]  noticeable why we did and then here recently hell storms and you know
[09:07.900 --> 09:13.100]  Colorado style monsoon storms sideways rain yeah flooding out your field
[09:13.100 --> 09:17.780]  knocking down plants you know I mean it's it's a challenge here at the you
[09:17.780 --> 09:23.020]  know you're at the whim of mother nature for sure absolutely yeah so we're trying
[09:23.020 --> 09:27.700]  to mimic that mother nature indoors so we added a dehumidifier and water that
[09:27.700 --> 09:32.860]  dehumidifier is gonna make heat yeah crank up the air conditioner a little
[09:32.860 --> 09:35.940]  bit more I hate those damn things that air conditioner is gonna make
[09:35.940 --> 09:39.980]  condensation and dripping out of the back also the dehumidifier making more
[09:39.980 --> 09:44.620]  water so now we got to get rid of more water it's like the old joke about the
[09:44.620 --> 09:49.500]  humidifier and the dehumidifier side by side eat the mic eat the mic sorry you're
[09:49.500 --> 09:52.860]  good it's a low sexy voice you disappear into the recording equipment
[09:52.860 --> 09:57.500]  it's like the old joke about putting a dehumidifier and humidifier side by side
[09:57.500 --> 10:01.860]  who's gonna win that's basically what we're doing in a grow room to die in it
[10:01.860 --> 10:05.740]  in my drying cure room I will put a humidifier and a dehumidifier on opposite
[10:05.740 --> 10:09.220]  ends and I'll set them both at 50% and I will watch them fight each other all day
[10:09.220 --> 10:12.540]  long yep don't turn don't turn either one of them off all day and then you get
[10:12.540 --> 10:17.180]  that but at that nice squish technique blows people's mind that people in
[10:17.180 --> 10:22.460]  climates as dry as ours put humidifiers into the group into the dry room yeah
[10:22.460 --> 10:27.180]  yes we have to people on the East Coast people on the East Coast are like why do
[10:27.180 --> 10:31.180]  you what's it dehumidifier what is what are a humidifier why do you have one of
[10:31.180 --> 10:34.420]  those our rooms are so thick that we can't even can't even get the plants to
[10:34.420 --> 10:39.540]  dry I was actually talking with an employee at work the other day about how
[10:39.540 --> 10:44.820]  I would rather grow in a drier climate when it comes to drying than a wet
[10:44.820 --> 10:52.580]  climate it's which humidity spikes here this last week our crop took longer to
[10:52.580 --> 10:55.860]  dry out than normal and there was no you know not much we could do about it right
[10:55.860 --> 11:01.260]  and it just made me think you know man how do they do that you know in Humboldt
[11:01.260 --> 11:07.020]  or you know or anywhere on the west coast Maine down in the swamp Florida
[11:07.020 --> 11:11.260]  yeah where they have humidity you know like how the fuck do you guys dry your
[11:11.260 --> 11:14.980]  butt out well also you don't ever hear about the Florida crunch or the
[11:14.980 --> 11:18.740]  California crunch but you do the phrase Colorado crunch when they talk about our
[11:18.740 --> 11:22.900]  weed a lot because it is it will get crispy here fairly very quickly most
[11:22.900 --> 11:28.460]  growers around here or let's say most shops around here especially a few years
[11:28.460 --> 11:34.060]  ago no one knew how to dry their weed no it's you know I've seen some shops that
[11:34.060 --> 11:39.100]  know how to do it right but we here recently we quickly went from a bunch of
[11:39.100 --> 11:42.500]  dudes growing in our basements taking it to the store to sell it that way and
[11:42.500 --> 11:46.460]  then we bought some bigger buildings and kind of put a couple more air
[11:46.460 --> 11:49.060]  conditioners than usual you know what we didn't know what we were how to
[11:49.060 --> 11:52.740]  commercially scale it so when it came to cut down all that product we still didn't
[11:52.740 --> 11:55.180]  know what we were doing it the same way we did it in the basement back in the
[11:55.180 --> 11:59.260]  day so we had to scramble and figure out how do I drive 50 pounds of herb at one
[11:59.260 --> 12:02.740]  time right this big old building then we had this giant room that we didn't know
[12:02.740 --> 12:07.820]  how to control so yeah as an industry we've taught ourselves how to do so much
[12:07.820 --> 12:12.540]  stuff it's pretty fucking amazing actually come a long way yeah we've shot
[12:12.540 --> 12:15.940]  ourselves in the foot a lot we took our own dicks quite a bit for quite a while
[12:15.940 --> 12:20.980]  for sure but like we have come a long way in this industry we have we have we
[12:20.980 --> 12:26.220]  spent way too much money on nutrients way too much money on the wrong HVAC yeah
[12:26.220 --> 12:30.180]  yeah oh fuck I've seen that so many times I think that I think the HVAC
[12:30.180 --> 12:36.940]  companies had a meeting and the growers come to us sell them this and then it's
[12:36.940 --> 12:40.300]  wrong so just just sell them this and then in a couple months we'll come in
[12:40.300 --> 12:43.660]  and we'll go oh yeah that other company whichever whoever gets the sale we'll
[12:43.660 --> 12:47.300]  just blame you we'll come in and we'll go oh no those guys are fucking retarded
[12:47.300 --> 12:51.620]  you need this equipment then we'll sell them that and then in about eight months
[12:51.620 --> 12:55.220]  bill bill do you want this sale okay bill and about eight months you come in
[12:55.220 --> 12:58.660]  and you just throw a wrench in all of it and you tell them oh no it all fails we
[12:58.660 --> 13:01.820]  have to replace all of it and then we'll just use all three of our techs to
[13:01.820 --> 13:05.860]  install it they'll never notice I think that they did something there's some
[13:05.860 --> 13:09.940]  sort of a scam because HVAC is the biggest fucking joke in the commercial
[13:09.940 --> 13:13.540]  growing industry right now I think a lot of electricians are running the same
[13:13.540 --> 13:19.500]  scam too unfortunately here in this town they're all the same business HVAC and
[13:19.500 --> 13:25.180]  electric are pretty much the same damn companies and the guys it's such a small
[13:25.180 --> 13:30.180]  hiring pool that if they fire bill from a and B he goes and works at C and D the
[13:30.180 --> 13:33.500]  next week and then you see him like you guys fired a and B because they're
[13:33.500 --> 13:36.380]  idiots but now they brought this guy he hired got hired at the other place that
[13:36.380 --> 13:39.100]  you hired and now you're like oh you brought the idiots back damn it it's
[13:39.100 --> 13:44.380]  kind of how growers in this state go to now that you mention it a long time ago
[13:44.380 --> 13:47.820]  I wanted to I wrote down that we should talk about why growers bounce from
[13:47.820 --> 13:56.460]  facility to facility man that's a trilogy book right there yeah I think
[13:56.460 --> 14:01.980]  the most diplomatic way we could speak about it is just growers and owners have
[14:01.980 --> 14:09.220]  a different approach for sure the owners so there's usually an investor
[14:09.220 --> 14:14.540]  and an owner and then a lead grower is kind of basically the and then there's
[14:14.540 --> 14:18.260]  also a metric manager who's got to make sure all the rules are for a compliance
[14:18.260 --> 14:21.300]  person metric person make sure all the rules are followed they're kind of the
[14:21.300 --> 14:25.060]  referee because they know the grower wants to be fucking gung-ho because we
[14:25.060 --> 14:27.380]  used to grow in the basement didn't care about the rules we just want to cut as
[14:27.380 --> 14:30.780]  many clones as we can and not write it down and do whatever and that compliance
[14:30.780 --> 14:34.500]  person is like hey write down all the clones anyway the dynamic usually goes
[14:34.500 --> 14:38.380]  an owner and an investor they got together and they wrote a business plan
[14:38.380 --> 14:42.900]  and this guy gave this guy money but this guy that's got the money just has
[14:42.900 --> 14:46.740]  ideas he doesn't know how to grow emote usually they kind of a vague idea enough
[14:46.740 --> 14:50.820]  of an idea to fuck everything up is usually about how much they know how to
[14:50.820 --> 14:53.500]  grow Jesse's keeping his mouth shut because he's got a job in the industry
[14:53.500 --> 14:56.340]  right now and he would like to keep it so I see him nodding and smiling
[14:56.340 --> 14:59.540]  occasionally but he's gonna keep his mouth out of this one it's business
[14:59.540 --> 15:03.820]  people yeah I mean it's business people but they don't and then you've got a
[15:03.820 --> 15:07.700]  grower like Jesse and I who when we look at the plants there's some love to it
[15:07.700 --> 15:11.620]  like something inside of us tingles when we see a happy fucking row of plants
[15:11.620 --> 15:15.860]  just praying all trellised out beautifully we all started doing this a
[15:15.860 --> 15:22.020]  long time ago when money wasn't really the main motivation right yeah we've
[15:22.020 --> 15:26.380]  risked our families our freedom our rights for this these other people came
[15:26.460 --> 15:31.100]  in after the rules changed and they're not risking well they're risking their
[15:31.100 --> 15:34.860]  money but that's basically what they're risking is their financial future they
[15:34.860 --> 15:40.180]  wrote business plans based on current trends and a lot of stuff has happened
[15:40.180 --> 15:43.980]  that you know some people may have seen the majority of people didn't see it
[15:43.980 --> 15:48.020]  happening I mean I've seen business plans written on selling pounds for
[15:48.020 --> 15:53.820]  $3,500 and you know that failed and now the average grow you know selling
[15:53.820 --> 15:57.100]  somewhere between like six and a thousand dollars most of those pounds
[15:57.100 --> 16:01.780]  going somewhere around eight and then that you know there's a hefty tax in
[16:01.780 --> 16:08.180]  there you include payroll and you know I mean and yes so it leads to a messed up
[16:08.180 --> 16:13.460]  situation a lot of people in different states just took a giant shit in their
[16:13.460 --> 16:18.860]  car or their cubicle or wherever this he did say six hundred to a thousand
[16:18.860 --> 16:25.500]  dollars a pound for top shelf indoor or at least high quality greenhouse hand
[16:25.500 --> 16:29.140]  trimmed product that Jesse and I would smoke if he dropped some on the table
[16:29.140 --> 16:32.220]  we'd grind it up and we don't fucking smoke a fatty of it right now it's
[16:32.220 --> 16:35.620]  quality product it's going for six hundred dollars to a thousand dollars a
[16:35.620 --> 16:40.100]  pound commercially this is not person to person this is this is in wholesale
[16:40.100 --> 16:44.940]  bulk orders we won't talk about how many but you got a lot of them that's going
[16:44.940 --> 16:47.860]  and they're paying all at once and they're paying six hundred with thousand
[16:47.860 --> 16:51.940]  dollars a pound and people I'd say three years ago weed was thirty two
[16:51.940 --> 16:56.420]  hundred dollars a pound about three years ago Oh easily yeah yeah a lot of
[16:56.420 --> 16:59.620]  those business plans got written on twenty five hundred a pound which was
[16:59.620 --> 17:03.860]  right you know that was the normal for quite a while for I never saw it going
[17:03.860 --> 17:07.540]  less than two thousand I always say two thousand because once you go down less
[17:07.540 --> 17:11.660]  than two thousand on a home grower scale that's when you you don't it's not
[17:11.660 --> 17:14.260]  really worth it yeah it's not worth it for the home grower that's why everybody
[17:14.260 --> 17:17.860]  in Colorado basically all the cash droppers they gave up it's all
[17:17.860 --> 17:21.140]  dispensary weed now if you're a cash crop and it's going somewhere else which
[17:21.140 --> 17:25.660]  I don't condone promote support but that shit happens whatever it's the only way
[17:25.660 --> 17:29.620]  it's worth anything here and if you live in one of these states that you know is
[17:29.620 --> 17:32.780]  building a program and going through this thing you don't think this is gonna
[17:32.780 --> 17:37.820]  happen to you you are wrong yeah it will happen and it's gonna go even lower and
[17:37.820 --> 17:44.100]  businesses that can't adapt large-scale indoor places that have twenty thirty
[17:44.100 --> 17:49.820]  thousand dollar a month electric bills they're not gonna survive you that's the
[17:49.820 --> 17:56.540]  challenge of being a head grower right now is learning to adapt and to grow a
[17:56.540 --> 18:01.040]  quality product the same amount of it for cheaper yes the exact same thing is
[18:01.040 --> 18:07.160]  big AG on a large scale and do it over and over again on a schedule predictable
[18:07.160 --> 18:11.080]  results never have a room empty for more than 12 hours you know if you're
[18:11.080 --> 18:13.960]  cleaning it getting it ready that's cool but by the time you come in for the next
[18:13.960 --> 18:17.280]  shift start putting plants in there so I want to wrap up the part I was talking
[18:17.280 --> 18:21.760]  about why we jump around because basically that investor wanted his money
[18:21.760 --> 18:26.800]  returned yesterday that owner told that investor we'd have money in nine weeks
[18:26.800 --> 18:33.600]  the grower told the owner will have a crop in 12 weeks so now there's all this
[18:33.600 --> 18:37.480]  bullshit that has to be played the owner says well I want it in ten weeks
[18:37.480 --> 18:41.200]  then and then the investor says well then I want it in eight weeks and the
[18:41.200 --> 18:44.840]  grower has to say but it's still gonna take 12 weeks to grow these plants and
[18:44.840 --> 18:49.080]  so it gets weird they want you to cut we'll cut off a week on each end you're
[18:49.080 --> 18:51.880]  like what doesn't you can't cut off a week of edge and a week of flower it's
[18:51.880 --> 18:55.200]  just not gonna work so then then you don't have the harvest weight that you
[18:55.200 --> 18:57.780]  want so then you have to have these weird arguments with them and then
[18:57.780 --> 19:00.560]  they're like why didn't you hit the weight you wanted because you cut me off
[19:00.560 --> 19:04.000]  two weeks and it tastes funny yeah why does it taste funny cuz I didn't get to
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.280]  flush for the week because you decided we're gonna cut it down a week early and
[19:07.280 --> 19:14.400]  and odds are this guy I used to work for this guy I think his name's Dave odds
[19:14.400 --> 19:20.000]  are he forced you to wet trim too that has happened that has happened so yeah
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.200]  that's why I see Jesse understands exactly where we were forced to do
[19:23.200 --> 19:26.040]  things we don't want to do we don't agree we come to it with heart they come
[19:26.040 --> 19:29.280]  to it with dollar signs in their eyes and it just doesn't work you got to put
[19:29.320 --> 19:32.000]  you got to grow from your heart that's the name of the podcast that's what
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.240]  we're doing if you're too if you're a bit too busy thinking about money when
[19:36.240 --> 19:39.120]  you're in the grow you're contaminating the plants if you're mad at your
[19:39.120 --> 19:41.280]  girlfriend when you're in the grow you're contaminating the plants if
[19:41.280 --> 19:43.480]  you're thinking about porn when you're in the grow some of us might be on
[19:43.480 --> 19:46.320]  action contaminating the plant if you're thinking about what you're gonna name
[19:46.320 --> 19:49.260]  that cross you made you're probably fucking up the plants focus pay
[19:49.260 --> 19:52.160]  attention what you don't feel the vibe of the plants be in a good mood put some
[19:52.160 --> 19:55.860]  music on dance around feel the plant love that get that vibe going in the
[19:55.860 --> 19:59.260]  grow it's much better than dollar signs dollar signs dollar signs at this point
[19:59.260 --> 20:03.100]  in the market, if you're looking to make money, do not invest in marijuana.
[20:03.100 --> 20:04.780]  There are, there are cannabis.
[20:04.780 --> 20:07.060]  There are a million different.
[20:07.460 --> 20:08.980]  Better ways to make money.
[20:09.220 --> 20:14.420]  If you insist on being part of the cannabis movement and you're not already
[20:14.420 --> 20:18.100]  in the Colorado market, invest in possibly an ancillary market, but
[20:18.100 --> 20:19.340]  that's already filling up also.
[20:19.340 --> 20:19.700]  For sure.
[20:19.820 --> 20:20.060]  Yeah.
[20:20.060 --> 20:24.500]  And I mean, like, I've got these Q-tips on the, on the table, uh, from Hempurco.
[20:24.500 --> 20:27.020]  They cover us with all the, the rig cleaning supplies.
[20:27.020 --> 20:29.060]  Maybe you can make something like a company like that.
[20:29.180 --> 20:31.620]  That sells us the Q-tips and the alcohol swab Q-tips.
[20:31.900 --> 20:33.220]  Maybe you can make glass.
[20:33.220 --> 20:34.620]  Maybe you can open up a head shop.
[20:34.620 --> 20:36.220]  Maybe you can open up a grow store.
[20:36.620 --> 20:43.620]  But a company that buys waste product from the, all the grows and takes it and
[20:43.620 --> 20:47.180]  turns it into an amazing compost and resells it, that would be amazing.
[20:47.260 --> 20:47.500]  Yeah.
[20:47.660 --> 20:47.980]  Yeah.
[20:48.020 --> 20:54.580]  That's needed grows in the cities, uh, have huge problems with, uh, people
[20:54.580 --> 20:58.100]  breaking into their trash cans to steal their waste, even though it's not worth
[20:58.100 --> 21:00.060]  shit, they still the pots.
[21:00.340 --> 21:03.820]  So you could probably actually charge the grows to take away the stuff.
[21:03.860 --> 21:04.020]  Yep.
[21:04.580 --> 21:04.820]  Yes.
[21:04.820 --> 21:06.340]  So you're making money two ways there.
[21:06.620 --> 21:08.500]  Also another business that kills it.
[21:08.660 --> 21:12.020]  We have a company that delivers compressed CO2.
[21:12.020 --> 21:16.460]  We have two CO2 tanks outside of the back of the building, giant CO2 tanks,
[21:16.460 --> 21:18.900]  like six or 12 of them, depending on the size of the facility.
[21:19.220 --> 21:22.540]  And then there's a regulator inside and then there's a computer attached to that
[21:22.540 --> 21:25.260]  and it runs it to each room and then each room's got its own sensors and
[21:25.260 --> 21:26.340]  it triggers when it's needed.
[21:26.540 --> 21:28.180]  Sirens and flashy lights.
[21:28.180 --> 21:30.740]  So yeah, so many stupid accessories to be sold to us.
[21:30.740 --> 21:34.020]  And then they had to train us on all the warnings and shit on it.
[21:34.460 --> 21:38.220]  Uh, do they show up once a week and the guy gets out of his truck and hooks up a
[21:38.220 --> 21:42.100]  tube to our tube and hits go and it goes, it's in the truck and stares at his phone.
[21:42.140 --> 21:43.180]  Yeah, seriously.
[21:43.180 --> 21:44.300]  He eats breakfast in his truck.
[21:44.300 --> 21:47.300]  I watch him spread his McDonald's smorgasbord all across the dash and
[21:47.300 --> 21:48.700]  just grubs down and plays with his phone.
[21:48.700 --> 21:50.340]  It takes like 45 minutes to phone.
[21:50.460 --> 21:51.380]  It's loud as shit.
[21:51.380 --> 21:53.740]  It sounds like a pump on a closed loop.
[21:53.780 --> 21:53.940]  Yep.
[21:54.220 --> 21:54.380]  Yep.
[21:54.380 --> 22:00.380]  Just everyone in the grow can hear it and can't wait till he fucking leaves.
[22:00.380 --> 22:00.700]  Yeah.
[22:00.860 --> 22:01.180]  Yeah.
[22:01.860 --> 22:02.020]  Dude.
[22:02.020 --> 22:03.300]  I like to, I learned a trick.
[22:03.540 --> 22:08.820]  Go to every flowering room and just crank up the fucking CO2, put it up to 2000 and
[22:08.820 --> 22:10.940]  he'll just dump into the whole room while he's filling you.
[22:11.420 --> 22:13.140]  So you can really crank up those rooms that day.
[22:14.700 --> 22:16.700]  It'd be like, I'm not sure why their tanks won't fill up.
[22:16.700 --> 22:17.860]  They were really low today.
[22:18.500 --> 22:19.540]  It's getting the same order.
[22:20.420 --> 22:22.020]  Uh, delivering water.
[22:22.180 --> 22:22.860]  That'd be a good one.
[22:22.900 --> 22:23.220]  Oh yeah.
[22:23.220 --> 22:24.100]  Delivering water.
[22:24.380 --> 22:28.660]  So here in Pueblo County, both these businesses, there's only, there's air
[22:28.660 --> 22:34.860]  gas or no, not air gas, something green, clean, or some shit that does the CO2.
[22:35.300 --> 22:38.940]  And then there's only one water company and that's Curry transportation.
[22:39.060 --> 22:43.580]  Um, I mean, fuck it's everyone hates curry.
[22:43.580 --> 22:45.020]  They just deliver water.
[22:45.100 --> 22:45.380]  Yeah.
[22:45.380 --> 22:45.700]  Yeah.
[22:45.900 --> 22:51.660]  That's so, and the dude, yeah, I'm not going to say too much, but he doesn't
[22:51.660 --> 22:54.500]  have a lot of fans out there, but they have no other choice.
[22:54.620 --> 22:54.940]  Yeah.
[22:55.060 --> 22:56.060]  He's got water.
[22:56.140 --> 22:56.380]  Yeah.
[22:56.380 --> 22:57.700]  That's like the number one thing.
[22:59.580 --> 22:59.900]  All right.
[22:59.900 --> 23:03.820]  So yeah, don't, if you're going to get into the industry, don't, uh, don't
[23:03.820 --> 23:06.740]  try to get into the cannabis industry in Colorado if you're doing it to make
[23:06.740 --> 23:10.660]  money because it's kind of late as kind of, I think our point, but I mean,
[23:10.660 --> 23:12.060]  I'm not trying to discourage people.
[23:12.420 --> 23:13.420]  This is just the truth.
[23:13.460 --> 23:14.060]  I agree.
[23:14.140 --> 23:16.980]  I, it is going to be a constant uphill battle for you.
[23:17.220 --> 23:18.820]  There are too many businesses right now.
[23:18.820 --> 23:23.780]  If you don't own the dispensary, the grow and maybe something else like an
[23:23.780 --> 23:27.740]  extraction or a concentrate company or some sort of other way to run it,
[23:27.740 --> 23:28.900]  you're not going to make any money.
[23:29.020 --> 23:30.900]  That's a $10 million bill right there.
[23:31.300 --> 23:34.900]  Easily a weird piece of advice that I don't even know if I should share, but
[23:34.900 --> 23:36.860]  I love the listeners and I love the community.
[23:36.860 --> 23:40.860]  This is something we should warn everybody about when cannabis becomes.
[23:41.580 --> 23:42.340]  Popular.
[23:42.380 --> 23:46.180]  And I don't want to say mainstream because it's almost mainstream here now.
[23:46.180 --> 23:47.220]  It's like just a thing here.
[23:47.220 --> 23:48.180]  It's one of the things.
[23:48.180 --> 23:48.780]  Pretty much.
[23:49.020 --> 23:52.860]  When everybody gets into it and it becomes part of the daily flow and people start
[23:52.860 --> 23:56.020]  understanding the products they enjoy and they start picking dispensaries where they
[23:56.020 --> 24:00.060]  want to go and they start experimenting with what's new and then they start.
[24:00.260 --> 24:02.660]  Coming to Colorado and checking out the culture here.
[24:03.140 --> 24:08.940]  Your market is going to turn to 25 to 35% concentrates.
[24:09.260 --> 24:10.100]  Yeah, definitely.
[24:10.180 --> 24:10.660]  Yes.
[24:10.700 --> 24:11.940]  People don't see that coming.
[24:12.260 --> 24:14.340]  They're going to have all this flower sitting there and people
[24:14.340 --> 24:15.460]  aren't going to want to buy flour.
[24:15.500 --> 24:18.020]  They're going to want high end concentrates.
[24:18.420 --> 24:22.820]  If I was going to start any kind of marijuana business here in Colorado,
[24:22.820 --> 24:24.140]  without a doubt, would be a lab.
[24:24.460 --> 24:24.700]  Yeah.
[24:24.740 --> 24:24.940]  Yeah.
[24:25.180 --> 24:25.860]  That's there.
[24:25.860 --> 24:28.020]  A one of the, I talk about them a lot.
[24:28.020 --> 24:31.500]  And when they opened, I had a couple of friends who are business minded.
[24:31.540 --> 24:33.180]  They said that place will never happen.
[24:33.460 --> 24:35.820]  There's a dispensary that only sells concentrates.
[24:35.820 --> 24:36.980]  They don't have any flowers.
[24:37.220 --> 24:40.260]  They have a small grow and they run their grow.
[24:40.300 --> 24:41.100]  They cut down the grow.
[24:41.140 --> 24:44.300]  They turn it into top shelf concentrates because they grew it.
[24:44.340 --> 24:47.500]  They knew exactly how to grow it, to produce the concentrates they want.
[24:47.740 --> 24:51.180]  They harvested it specifically for these concentrates in their facility.
[24:51.500 --> 24:52.220]  They froze it.
[24:52.220 --> 24:52.940]  They prepared it.
[24:52.940 --> 24:56.060]  Then they ran it and they make very high quality concentrates.
[24:56.060 --> 24:59.940]  And there's a line every time I go there and they'd never sell any flour.
[24:59.940 --> 25:02.300]  They do carry some edibles that are outsourced, but they've got.
[25:02.860 --> 25:03.540]  Concentrates.
[25:03.540 --> 25:07.940]  They've got batters, butters, HCFSE, HTFSE.
[25:07.940 --> 25:09.100]  They've got them mixed.
[25:09.420 --> 25:13.100]  Uh, they've got big 22 gram pucks from the bottom of the jar.
[25:13.100 --> 25:15.100]  That's just two 22 gram diamonds.
[25:15.420 --> 25:15.860]  Jesus.
[25:15.900 --> 25:19.620]  It's so yeah, it's 50 bucks a gram and they don't break the pucks up.
[25:19.620 --> 25:22.020]  You got to buy the whole 22 gram puck if you'd like it.
[25:22.660 --> 25:24.140]  Yeah, but it's available if you want it.
[25:24.340 --> 25:25.140]  And they.
[25:25.580 --> 25:27.420]  Obviously sell them because they have them.
[25:27.540 --> 25:27.860]  Yeah.
[25:27.940 --> 25:32.100]  They've got, uh, H uh, high cannabinoid, full spectrum extract diamonds that
[25:32.100 --> 25:34.220]  weigh three and four and five grams.
[25:34.620 --> 25:35.180]  Holy shit.
[25:35.180 --> 25:35.420]  Yeah.
[25:35.420 --> 25:36.220]  And the stuff sells.
[25:36.260 --> 25:39.460]  They there's all, I go there, I shop there quite frequently.
[25:39.500 --> 25:40.100]  So yeah.
[25:40.500 --> 25:43.980]  I remember, uh, when they opened, uh, people said their business
[25:44.020 --> 25:45.620]  model wouldn't work a lot.
[25:45.660 --> 25:46.580]  I heard that a lot.
[25:46.660 --> 25:48.140]  I was even doubting.
[25:48.300 --> 25:48.820]  So yeah.
[25:49.140 --> 25:51.820]  But they're a hundred percent concentrates and it is working.
[25:52.060 --> 25:52.780]  It is working.
[25:52.780 --> 25:55.500]  So if you guys are trying to build a business plan, keep in mind that the
[25:55.500 --> 26:00.140]  market will turn to concentrates, vapable, smokable concentrates, also something.
[26:00.380 --> 26:02.020]  I don't know why I'm giving you all kinds of business tips that
[26:02.020 --> 26:04.460]  we should keep to ourselves, but we're already here.
[26:04.460 --> 26:05.820]  We're past this step in this market.
[26:05.820 --> 26:07.540]  So this is just things that I've learned.
[26:08.380 --> 26:09.500]  People are going to love those.
[26:09.740 --> 26:11.940]  And I almost used a word that I'm trying to take out of my vocabulary.
[26:11.940 --> 26:14.060]  People are going to love those whack ass pens.
[26:14.380 --> 26:16.660]  Uh, everyone's into the pens now.
[26:16.700 --> 26:17.380]  They're huge.
[26:17.460 --> 26:17.820]  Yeah.
[26:17.860 --> 26:22.180]  And it's, we sell a lot of our product that gets, that's all it's for.
[26:22.260 --> 26:22.460]  Yeah.
[26:22.460 --> 26:23.340]  I mean, yeah.
[26:23.460 --> 26:24.780]  It's sad to see it go off.
[26:24.820 --> 26:25.820]  No, again, trim.
[26:26.060 --> 26:26.340]  Wow.
[26:26.820 --> 26:27.180]  Wow.
[26:27.780 --> 26:30.340]  Uh, there are some companies that are making some really high quality
[26:30.340 --> 26:32.020]  pens and they're super popular.
[26:32.260 --> 26:34.860]  You know, I'm not a big fan of them, but one time we were driving home in a
[26:34.860 --> 26:38.580]  snowstorm and, uh, the car's in front of me all fucking spun out and I was having
[26:38.580 --> 26:41.620]  a little bit of a, like a, like, Oh shit in the car.
[26:41.940 --> 26:44.140]  And somebody just reached out and they handed me a pen and they're like,
[26:44.140 --> 26:44.940]  here, this'll help.
[26:44.980 --> 26:46.060]  And I was like, Oh yeah.
[26:46.340 --> 26:48.420]  It's like one good rip off of that pen and set it down.
[26:48.420 --> 26:49.860]  And I was like, Oh, the nerves are better.
[26:50.180 --> 26:51.860]  I can fucking focus on driving again.
[26:52.220 --> 26:53.700]  I go ahead.
[26:53.780 --> 26:55.340]  They're great when you're traveling.
[26:55.420 --> 26:55.940]  Yes.
[26:56.900 --> 27:01.180]  And we, we're not condoning maybe taking a rip off a pen in the car or while you're
[27:01.380 --> 27:04.620]  getting in the airport or whatever, but maybe something like that does happen.
[27:04.620 --> 27:05.700]  People love the pens.
[27:05.700 --> 27:06.700]  The pens are super handy.
[27:06.700 --> 27:08.540]  The girls love the pens.
[27:08.780 --> 27:14.260]  They're pretty, uh, inconspicuous at this point too, because of all the other vaping
[27:14.260 --> 27:14.900]  devices.
[27:14.900 --> 27:15.260]  Right.
[27:15.300 --> 27:18.220]  So if you're going to a concert or whatever, you could just take your, your
[27:18.220 --> 27:21.820]  dab vape pen right on in, go take some waxy hits while you're in there.
[27:22.140 --> 27:25.220]  Uh, my problem is I just pretty much cook them out and like two or three good hits
[27:26.220 --> 27:27.780]  and then by then it's roasted and gone.
[27:28.620 --> 27:30.460]  But yeah, most of them just don't.
[27:31.220 --> 27:35.460]  I mean, they're great in certain situations, but like just as a daily use
[27:35.460 --> 27:37.100]  thing, most of them don't do it for me.
[27:37.260 --> 27:37.580]  Right.
[27:37.780 --> 27:38.580]  Myself as well.
[27:38.620 --> 27:39.500]  I'd rather have a dab.
[27:39.500 --> 27:41.820]  I feel like they're like half a dab.
[27:42.100 --> 27:47.820]  If you're a, uh, a normal flower smoker, if you just smoke flowers, like if you're
[27:47.820 --> 27:51.740]  just a normal work, Jesse and I are kind of expert level pot smokers.
[27:51.740 --> 27:53.940]  We might smoke a little more than the average bear.
[27:54.140 --> 27:55.820]  If you're just a normal smoker, those pens.
[27:56.340 --> 27:59.620]  Uh, since it's concentrates when you're hitting that pan, maybe if you hit that
[27:59.620 --> 28:01.340]  on a lunch break or while you're on a bike, right.
[28:01.340 --> 28:03.060]  You'll notice that they'll wreck you.
[28:03.180 --> 28:03.420]  Yeah.
[28:03.500 --> 28:07.220]  You'll, you'll definitely notice just for the distillate in them is very potent.
[28:07.300 --> 28:07.580]  Yeah.
[28:07.900 --> 28:11.820]  Uh, green dots actually selling a pin that is made all with the, uh,
[28:11.860 --> 28:12.940]  full spectrum extract.
[28:12.940 --> 28:14.580]  Now they're putting their silver label.
[28:14.860 --> 28:15.100]  Yeah.
[28:15.100 --> 28:17.260]  They're silver label full spectrum extract in there.
[28:17.260 --> 28:18.780]  And they're pretty nice from what I've heard.
[28:18.780 --> 28:20.980]  Everyone's been giving them a rave reviews.
[28:21.140 --> 28:21.780]  Green dots.
[28:21.780 --> 28:22.300]  The shit.
[28:22.380 --> 28:22.580]  Yeah.
[28:22.580 --> 28:23.660]  That's who I've been buying lately.
[28:23.740 --> 28:24.940]  Green dot and apothecary.
[28:24.940 --> 28:26.660]  It's my two go-to concentrate companies.
[28:27.020 --> 28:28.940]  Uh, TR TR is good.
[28:28.980 --> 28:30.460]  I like a contraband.
[28:30.540 --> 28:33.020]  They're the in-house company for a cut above.
[28:33.300 --> 28:33.780]  Oh, okay.
[28:33.820 --> 28:34.140]  Yeah.
[28:34.420 --> 28:38.860]  They've got some Durban Cush sauce that is always on point and their star
[28:38.900 --> 28:43.620]  child OG sauce is some of my favorite, but it sells out so quickly and they
[28:43.940 --> 28:46.700]  are 45 minutes away, so I don't like to drive up there to find out if they have
[28:46.700 --> 28:47.340]  it for sure.
[28:47.500 --> 28:47.820]  For sure.
[28:48.300 --> 28:51.980]  It's I've actually never been to a pot to carry or cut above.
[28:52.060 --> 28:53.060]  Oh, go check them both out.
[28:53.260 --> 28:54.540]  You will enjoy the experience.
[28:54.540 --> 28:56.060]  It's been a few years since I had a med car.
[28:56.060 --> 28:58.620]  I was going to say if you're shopping in Springs, you got to have that paperwork.
[28:59.300 --> 28:59.620]  So.
[29:00.100 --> 29:01.860]  Uh, it's not even paperwork anymore.
[29:01.860 --> 29:06.860]  It's, uh, you can have a PDF on your phone that works and it's just pretty handy.
[29:07.020 --> 29:07.540]  I've seen it.
[29:07.620 --> 29:14.020]  Um, my dad got keeps his, uh, he is non-smart phone, so he's got the paper.
[29:14.180 --> 29:18.180]  He had to wait like fucking 60 days or some shit to get the piece of paper in
[29:18.180 --> 29:19.700]  the mail that I could have printed off.
[29:20.140 --> 29:23.940]  Like I just, I didn't know, like now when he goes to renew, I'll be like,
[29:23.940 --> 29:25.140]  just let me come with you.
[29:25.220 --> 29:25.540]  Right.
[29:25.860 --> 29:29.020]  So back in the day you would go to the doctor, they would fill out your
[29:29.020 --> 29:31.060]  paperwork, you would mail some paper to the state.
[29:31.140 --> 29:32.860]  The state would take for fucking ever.
[29:32.980 --> 29:35.500]  Then they would mail you back your card and then you would have this card.
[29:35.500 --> 29:36.780]  Then you could go to the dispensary.
[29:37.340 --> 29:40.940]  If you lost that card or it got stolen or whatever happened to it.
[29:41.020 --> 29:42.420]  Now you can't shop the dispenser.
[29:42.420 --> 29:46.820]  You have to mail email or message or write to the state.
[29:47.060 --> 29:48.660]  And then they would send you a replacement card.
[29:48.660 --> 29:51.060]  If you could prove you were who you were and that your card was valid.
[29:51.300 --> 29:52.540]  And that would take weeks.
[29:53.140 --> 29:55.660]  Now they've put all the registry online.
[29:55.700 --> 29:58.700]  So you go to the doctor, the doctor types, all your info in while he's
[29:58.700 --> 29:59.940]  visiting you and he hits send.
[29:59.940 --> 30:02.580]  And by the time he's done hitting, send your stuff goes to the state.
[30:02.860 --> 30:04.300]  The state reviews it for approval.
[30:04.620 --> 30:07.180]  I've never seen anybody get declined with the new doctor set up.
[30:08.060 --> 30:11.740]  They send you an email, you send in a payment and then it says print your
[30:11.740 --> 30:14.980]  card is the next tab that pops up and you hit print and it sends it right to my
[30:14.980 --> 30:15.420]  printer.
[30:15.740 --> 30:18.180]  And you can print your card out now on regular paper.
[30:18.300 --> 30:21.580]  If you would like to have a paper copy, I actually keep one of my glove box in
[30:21.580 --> 30:23.220]  case my phone dies or something goes weird.
[30:23.220 --> 30:24.340]  I got a paper copy in there.
[30:24.980 --> 30:26.700]  Uh, cause I like to shop when I'm out of town.
[30:26.700 --> 30:27.580]  I like to be able to just go ship.
[30:27.580 --> 30:30.220]  It's much cheaper to shop at the, uh, the medical stores by the way.
[30:30.980 --> 30:35.140]  And then I've got my, uh, I've got a PDF of my card on my phone and honestly all
[30:35.140 --> 30:36.300]  the stores I shop, they know me.
[30:36.300 --> 30:37.300]  So I just flash it.
[30:37.300 --> 30:39.780]  They barely even look now you show your ID and your card and they go, okay, come
[30:39.780 --> 30:40.140]  on Jeff.
[30:40.340 --> 30:40.940]  Good to see you again.
[30:42.740 --> 30:44.340]  So yeah, it's a much simpler process.
[30:44.340 --> 30:46.420]  Now we don't have to deal with the mail so much.
[30:47.340 --> 30:49.940]  Uh, we kind of touched on it a minute ago and it got abandoned cause we were
[30:49.940 --> 30:51.260]  talking about like four things at once.
[30:51.260 --> 30:55.900]  But, uh, before we start wrapping it up, let's talk about a couple of the major
[30:55.940 --> 31:00.380]  things people are going to notice when they go from growing in their basement.
[31:00.860 --> 31:03.180]  To a large scale facility.
[31:05.340 --> 31:06.660]  I like that look on your face.
[31:07.300 --> 31:11.980]  Uh, I don't even know where to start with that one.
[31:12.900 --> 31:14.860]  I don't mean to sound like an asshole or anything.
[31:14.860 --> 31:16.140]  No, it's a completely different ballgame.
[31:16.140 --> 31:16.980]  So you're totally right.
[31:17.740 --> 31:18.940]  And I don't have any notes in front of me.
[31:18.940 --> 31:21.660]  So all of this episode has all been off the top of my head today.
[31:21.660 --> 31:23.420]  So I'm not keeping track of where we're going.
[31:23.460 --> 31:24.420]  A lot of times I keep notes.
[31:24.420 --> 31:25.340]  So I know where we've been.
[31:25.700 --> 31:30.260]  A lot of, there are a ton of inefficiencies in basement grows.
[31:30.700 --> 31:35.340]  Uh, you guys, I don't mean, fuck, I sound like such an asshole.
[31:35.540 --> 31:41.380]  Basement growers, uh, waste an extraordinary amount of time and an
[31:41.380 --> 31:43.340]  extraordinary amount of money too, in my opinion.
[31:43.540 --> 31:43.820]  Yes.
[31:43.860 --> 31:49.940]  Um, so you're going to notice going from like a basement to let's say a 1500
[31:49.940 --> 31:51.180]  plant grow or something like that.
[31:51.620 --> 31:58.020]  Um, if you water that 1500 plant grow the same way you, you possibly water your
[31:58.020 --> 32:00.940]  basement, uh, it's going to take you a day and a half.
[32:01.020 --> 32:03.300]  And when you get to the end, guess what?
[32:03.300 --> 32:04.020]  They're going to need water.
[32:04.020 --> 32:11.740]  You start over, uh, things like de-leafing and topping, uh, take so much more time.
[32:12.100 --> 32:17.060]  Um, you wouldn't believe what it takes to say top 250 plants or something like that.
[32:17.580 --> 32:24.020]  Um, I, when I have guys do that, I'm normally, I'd probably say three, four
[32:24.020 --> 32:29.140]  hours, and these are guys that do that, you know, uh, you know, once a week,
[32:29.180 --> 32:33.380]  they're professionals, um, and it still takes, you know, a while.
[32:33.940 --> 32:36.660]  Uh, it's just every, the workload is so, so much bigger.
[32:37.220 --> 32:42.780]  Uh, little insect problems turn big, very fucking quickly, very quickly.
[32:42.900 --> 32:46.860]  Um, man, there's just, it's a completely different ball game.
[32:46.940 --> 32:52.860]  It's like, you know, having a backyard garden versus having, you know, two acre
[32:52.860 --> 32:53.220]  garden.
[32:53.420 --> 32:53.780]  Yeah.
[32:53.860 --> 32:54.740]  That's a good way to put it.
[32:54.820 --> 32:55.100]  Yeah.
[32:55.220 --> 32:58.340]  It's a, you know, around like week four, five and six.
[32:58.940 --> 33:02.260]  Uh, there's a lot of video game time, but you got to basement grow like week
[33:02.260 --> 33:03.660]  four or five and six or shit to do.
[33:03.660 --> 33:05.820]  I mean, you got to have some de-leafing and whatever, but all the
[33:05.820 --> 33:07.860]  toppings been done, the lollipopping is done.
[33:07.860 --> 33:09.220]  All the trellising is in place.
[33:09.220 --> 33:12.540]  You're just making sure now you're in that, like, fingers are crossed, kind
[33:12.540 --> 33:16.100]  of no powdery mildew home stretch, hoping sure that, or making sure that no
[33:16.100 --> 33:17.820]  spider mites pop up now at the end.
[33:18.100 --> 33:19.820]  It's like week four or five, six.
[33:20.340 --> 33:22.620]  Seven, eight, nine fucking plan.
[33:22.620 --> 33:23.100]  Xbox.
[33:23.100 --> 33:23.500]  You know what I mean?
[33:23.500 --> 33:27.540]  Pretty much like selling the last crop is what we used to be busy fucking
[33:27.540 --> 33:30.380]  smoking and selling the last one, weighing out bags and meeting up with
[33:30.380 --> 33:31.700]  people is what we used to do.
[33:31.980 --> 33:33.140]  Uh, that doesn't happen anymore.
[33:33.140 --> 33:35.740]  There's none of that video game time, that video game time.
[33:36.420 --> 33:40.380]  Now you're cutting clones for the crop that's coming up in two weeks.
[33:40.700 --> 33:44.180]  And then when you're done cutting clones, you have to get the other clones that
[33:44.220 --> 33:48.020]  were already cut and put them into the six inch net pots or the four by four
[33:48.020 --> 33:50.260]  pots and work them through their rotation.
[33:50.260 --> 33:50.540]  Yeah.
[33:50.580 --> 33:50.900]  Yeah.
[33:50.940 --> 33:53.860]  As soon as you're done with that, you have to go up, pot the ones that were
[33:53.860 --> 33:55.900]  already done into the three gallon pots.
[33:56.300 --> 33:58.660]  And then once those are done, you have to move those other three gallon
[33:58.660 --> 34:00.340]  pots into that room that's empty now.
[34:00.940 --> 34:02.620]  And it just never stops.
[34:02.860 --> 34:05.180]  And then it never, there's never a day.
[34:05.180 --> 34:08.580]  And if you fall behind one day, you're two days behind because you have
[34:08.580 --> 34:10.700]  to do today's work tomorrow.
[34:10.880 --> 34:12.900]  And then what are you going to do about tomorrow's work?
[34:12.900 --> 34:15.420]  You're going to have to do that sometime also.
[34:15.820 --> 34:17.460]  So you're either going to have to work some overtime.
[34:17.460 --> 34:18.500]  You're going to have to catch up.
[34:18.820 --> 34:19.900]  So it doubles the pace.
[34:19.900 --> 34:21.540]  And Jesse started off the best way.
[34:21.820 --> 34:26.500]  Uh, that shows that Jesse and I have evolved a long way from being basement
[34:26.500 --> 34:29.540]  growers to becoming business minded, professional growers.
[34:29.620 --> 34:33.180]  We did it gradually because when we started the average commercial
[34:33.180 --> 34:35.460]  grow room, didn't look too much different than a basement.
[34:35.620 --> 34:35.980]  Right.
[34:36.180 --> 34:37.020]  So absolutely.
[34:37.020 --> 34:40.660]  My first couple of commercial grows were just expanded basement grows.
[34:40.820 --> 34:44.220]  We didn't know I've seen clone areas bigger than, right.
[34:44.260 --> 34:44.620]  Yeah.
[34:44.660 --> 34:45.100]  Yeah.
[34:45.300 --> 34:45.740]  It's.
[34:46.140 --> 34:50.100]  But yeah, uh, people that have been around as long as me and Jeff, uh,
[34:50.700 --> 34:52.300]  kind of grew into it organically.
[34:52.380 --> 34:52.820]  Right.
[34:53.140 --> 34:56.980]  Don't jump into, don't, don't think your first facility needs to be a hundred
[34:56.980 --> 35:00.140]  lights, figure out how to kill one light worth of plants before you figure out how
[35:00.140 --> 35:01.700]  to kill a hundred lights worth of plants.
[35:01.740 --> 35:02.140]  For sure.
[35:02.260 --> 35:02.700]  For sure.
[35:03.180 --> 35:05.740]  Uh, then, then he said, you're wasting a lot of time.
[35:05.740 --> 35:07.020]  You're wasting a lot of money.
[35:07.500 --> 35:09.740]  Think about when you're in that grow.
[35:10.660 --> 35:13.060]  And there's the licenses are so expensive.
[35:13.180 --> 35:14.580]  The heating is so expensive.
[35:14.820 --> 35:16.460]  The lighting is so expensive.
[35:16.460 --> 35:18.980]  The air conditioning is so expensive and you're in there all day.
[35:18.980 --> 35:20.620]  Staffing is way expensive.
[35:20.820 --> 35:24.020]  The rent, the rent, water bill, water bill.
[35:24.060 --> 35:24.660]  Oh my God.
[35:24.660 --> 35:26.300]  The water bill taxes.
[35:26.380 --> 35:30.140]  You know, when you go this, this may sound racist, but maybe it is, you know,
[35:30.140 --> 35:33.180]  when you go to YouTube and you watch people doing their jobs and it's always
[35:33.180 --> 35:36.660]  people from other countries, it's some other very cultural country.
[35:37.020 --> 35:40.660]  The dude's got a knife and a mango and his job is to peel mangoes.
[35:40.900 --> 35:45.140]  The fucker doesn't blink, but his right hand just makes this motion, this left,
[35:45.140 --> 35:46.020]  right, left, right, left, right.
[35:46.020 --> 35:48.700]  And the mango in his left hand just fucking spins.
[35:49.020 --> 35:49.220]  Yeah.
[35:49.260 --> 35:51.380]  Nobody blinks and all these mangoes are peeled.
[35:52.620 --> 35:57.220]  You're going to have to get processes like that down in your facility.
[35:57.420 --> 35:59.940]  I told her all of our guys get Asian on it, bro.
[36:00.100 --> 36:03.260]  Like get Asian, turn into an Asian factory worker, but you still have
[36:03.260 --> 36:04.900]  to be mindful at the same time.
[36:05.260 --> 36:06.700]  I've accomplished a lot.
[36:07.180 --> 36:11.340]  Um, in the last couple of years at this grow with, with the help of great
[36:11.340 --> 36:15.820]  employees, but, um, uh, or mostly great employees, but they're not there anymore.
[36:15.820 --> 36:18.620]  So, uh, good ones always move on.
[36:18.700 --> 36:19.380]  No, no, no.
[36:19.380 --> 36:20.540]  The good ones have stayed.
[36:20.580 --> 36:22.140]  The shitty ones have moved on.
[36:22.740 --> 36:24.460]  Yeah, no, it was pretty fortunate.
[36:24.900 --> 36:27.460]  Well, I can't say that about everyone that's moved on from there,
[36:27.540 --> 36:28.900]  but I'll just shut my mouth.
[36:29.380 --> 36:32.700]  Um, but, uh, being a manager is a bitch sometimes, ain't it?
[36:32.780 --> 36:36.460]  Developing the systems that we have developed is like one of my
[36:36.460 --> 36:37.820]  proudest achievements there.
[36:37.900 --> 36:42.100]  And it's like, it's something that I really consider carries
[36:42.100 --> 36:43.420]  a lot of weight on my resume.
[36:43.660 --> 36:50.100]  Um, you know, if, if another serious business, uh, grow type was to look at it,
[36:50.340 --> 36:53.620]  you know, that that's, you know, that's what I'm going to be put,
[36:53.780 --> 36:54.940]  you know, thrown out there.
[36:54.940 --> 37:00.900]  It's, you know, um, the, yeah, it's just, you move this industry along.
[37:00.940 --> 37:02.260]  We, wow.
[37:02.260 --> 37:03.380]  I didn't, I don't think about it that much.
[37:03.380 --> 37:04.260]  We're kind of pioneers.
[37:04.300 --> 37:08.980]  We were here when like, I was part of metamor, the first dispensary in town here.
[37:09.140 --> 37:11.140]  She's one of the first dispensaries in the state.
[37:11.220 --> 37:13.620]  Yeah, it was the first, it was the first one in this city.
[37:13.620 --> 37:16.460]  There were some outside of our city limits, but it was the, we were right
[37:16.460 --> 37:19.020]  in the heart of downtown, just doing it loud and proud.
[37:19.380 --> 37:24.100]  That product was grown in my basement on, in another part of town here in another
[37:24.100 --> 37:25.780]  house, that's where that used to come from.
[37:26.300 --> 37:29.140]  Then they built another little thing in their building.
[37:29.140 --> 37:30.500]  That was a little bit bigger.
[37:30.940 --> 37:33.220]  And then, uh, we had some other friends.
[37:33.220 --> 37:35.900]  I don't know how much I could talk about cause it's in the past, but I still
[37:35.900 --> 37:37.220]  don't want to throw people under the bus.
[37:37.220 --> 37:40.900]  We had somebody that built a fairly semi-large warehouse that needed help.
[37:40.900 --> 37:42.260]  And they let us come.
[37:42.260 --> 37:43.540]  You were there for a while.
[37:43.540 --> 37:45.060]  I went and helped out sometimes.
[37:45.460 --> 37:48.380]  And we both had other people build greenhouses and other things.
[37:48.380 --> 37:50.420]  And we got to go see, oh, it got bigger.
[37:50.420 --> 37:51.020]  It got bigger.
[37:51.020 --> 37:51.660]  It got bigger.
[37:51.660 --> 37:53.500]  And then people in Springs needed help.
[37:53.500 --> 37:55.180]  And I got to go see even bigger places.
[37:55.180 --> 37:56.740]  And I was like, wow, it's getting bigger.
[37:57.060 --> 37:59.700]  And now you can tell who has been in big facilities.
[37:59.820 --> 38:02.900]  When you take somebody with you and they walk in places and their chin hits the
[38:02.900 --> 38:05.340]  floor or they just nod like, yeah.
[38:05.460 --> 38:05.780]  Yeah.
[38:05.980 --> 38:06.620]  I love that.
[38:06.660 --> 38:06.820]  Yeah.
[38:06.820 --> 38:11.180]  It's funny to watch people see that they either pass out and get shaky or they're
[38:11.180 --> 38:12.060]  just like, yeah, whatever.
[38:12.060 --> 38:12.780]  Another grow.
[38:13.180 --> 38:17.740]  It's easy to get jaded about a lot of things, but when I do a tour at the grow
[38:17.900 --> 38:22.020]  and I get that jaw hitting the floor, like it just, it takes me back a little
[38:22.020 --> 38:22.860]  bit, it makes me smile.
[38:22.900 --> 38:23.020]  Yeah.
[38:23.020 --> 38:29.660]  So, you know, to see someone have that kind of passion for, um, for all
[38:29.660 --> 38:32.100]  of this, you know, just kind of reminds me of where I came from.
[38:32.140 --> 38:32.420]  Right.
[38:32.700 --> 38:32.900]  Yeah.
[38:32.940 --> 38:36.660]  We put in blood, sweat, tears, and more blood, sweat, and tears.
[38:36.860 --> 38:37.100]  Right.
[38:37.100 --> 38:40.900]  And yeah, we look at it a little differently, but you know, I try to never,
[38:40.900 --> 38:42.020]  uh, try to never lose that.
[38:42.020 --> 38:43.980]  I try to still love my photography.
[38:43.980 --> 38:45.020]  Love growing the plant.
[38:45.340 --> 38:48.740]  Like you can see it in the photography that I'm still still in love with those
[38:48.740 --> 38:49.100]  girls.
[38:49.300 --> 38:49.700]  Definitely.
[38:49.700 --> 38:49.980]  Yeah.
[38:50.220 --> 38:50.420]  Yeah.
[38:51.300 --> 38:55.220]  That's I I've still, you know, I'm not completely jaded, uh, the day to day
[38:55.220 --> 38:55.820]  process.
[38:55.820 --> 39:02.020]  I'm like, it's, uh, I hate it cause I used to talk shit about it, but, or talk
[39:02.020 --> 39:03.420]  shit about people that thought this way.
[39:03.420 --> 39:07.700]  But, um, it's a lot of just moving widgets from one place to the other.
[39:07.700 --> 39:07.860]  Yeah.
[39:07.940 --> 39:09.900]  So it's, it's a good, it's a production.
[39:09.900 --> 39:10.700]  It's a conveyor belt.
[39:10.780 --> 39:12.340]  You just got to keep that conveyor belt going.
[39:12.780 --> 39:14.100]  Uh, we'll get a new clone.
[39:14.220 --> 39:15.860]  I always get jazzed about that.
[39:16.340 --> 39:19.420]  Um, you know, pop a pack of seeds here and there.
[39:19.500 --> 39:23.180]  Fucking that's the kind of shit that's, that just, all it takes is a new cut in
[39:23.220 --> 39:26.660]  the garden and you pack the seeds or just that new opportunity for something.
[39:26.660 --> 39:29.740]  Or you find out this new grow tech, you're like, Oh, we're going to try that in the
[39:29.740 --> 39:30.660]  whole next crop.
[39:30.700 --> 39:34.420]  So the whole next crop is super exciting just because of some new idea that you got.
[39:34.540 --> 39:34.820]  Yeah.
[39:34.940 --> 39:35.660]  That's always fun.
[39:35.660 --> 39:35.980]  Yeah.
[39:36.100 --> 39:37.020]  Testing products.
[39:37.020 --> 39:40.140]  I get to test a bunch of new stuff for a couple companies we use.
[39:40.140 --> 39:41.180]  So that's always fun.
[39:41.220 --> 39:42.540]  I like side-by-side tests.
[39:42.700 --> 39:43.420]  Those are the best.
[39:43.660 --> 39:48.300]  It's easy to do when you've got 3,600 plants in bloom and you tell two companies,
[39:48.300 --> 39:50.460]  yeah, I'm going to run your stuff on this many plants.
[39:50.460 --> 39:51.460]  And then they're like, Oh shit.
[39:51.460 --> 39:54.540]  And then they help you dial it in and you get your schedule figured out with them.
[39:54.540 --> 39:56.820]  And then you do the other company and get it dialed in with them.
[39:56.820 --> 39:59.660]  And then you just go head to head and go see what happens.
[39:59.900 --> 40:00.100]  Yep.
[40:00.180 --> 40:01.020]  We've done that way.
[40:01.020 --> 40:03.060]  The weights at the end, test the potency at the end.
[40:03.980 --> 40:06.380]  It's kind of like being a Roman emperor, man.
[40:06.540 --> 40:12.420]  I mean, you create victors and victims because someone's always going to be sad
[40:12.420 --> 40:13.220]  when that happens.
[40:14.420 --> 40:18.140]  I like the look on the grow tech's faces when new clones come in.
[40:18.180 --> 40:21.260]  It's like, uh, they come in in a box and it's covered, you know, cause nobody can
[40:21.260 --> 40:22.660]  see anything as it's being transferred.
[40:22.940 --> 40:25.980]  And then you open the box and it's like the suitcase on Pulp Fiction, the
[40:27.580 --> 40:28.900]  what's in here, Rasta Jeff.
[40:28.900 --> 40:32.420]  And they'll gather around like Santa Claus or like grandpa on the Christmas
[40:32.420 --> 40:32.780]  morning.
[40:32.940 --> 40:35.140]  Now here's this one says it's for Jesse.
[40:36.180 --> 40:37.780]  What, what's in the bag of presents?
[40:37.780 --> 40:39.220]  They're all excited about it.
[40:39.220 --> 40:41.980]  And you pull out Clementine and like, Oh, Clementine.
[40:41.980 --> 40:42.740]  And they cheer.
[40:43.140 --> 40:44.060]  You pull out the next one.
[40:44.060 --> 40:44.420]  What is it?
[40:44.420 --> 40:45.620]  It's blueberry cookies.
[40:45.620 --> 40:47.460]  And someone in the back is like blueberry cookies.
[40:47.460 --> 40:48.460]  Yeah.
[40:48.980 --> 40:51.900]  It's always so much fun to see people and you get new cuts in the facility.
[40:51.900 --> 40:52.580]  Even the tremors.
[40:52.580 --> 40:53.740]  They're like, what did, what did we get?
[40:53.980 --> 40:54.620]  What did we get?
[40:54.900 --> 40:58.380]  Uh, the tremors more so sometimes than then grow techs.
[40:58.460 --> 40:58.740]  Yeah.
[40:58.780 --> 41:01.900]  Well, because they've been trimming that fucking ghost dog for the past seven days
[41:01.900 --> 41:06.100]  and they cannot wait to trim something that's not ghost dog, whatever's next,
[41:06.100 --> 41:06.340]  bro.
[41:06.340 --> 41:07.620]  I'm just tired of looking at this one.
[41:09.540 --> 41:09.780]  Yeah.
[41:10.340 --> 41:12.820]  Uh, I need to keep my mouth shut right now.
[41:12.820 --> 41:16.380]  I was about to say something trimming you guys keep in mind that when it comes, when
[41:16.380 --> 41:20.540]  you have a commercial facility, uh, you just cut down, we've been throwing out
[41:20.540 --> 41:21.380]  huge numbers.
[41:21.660 --> 41:25.580]  Uh, we used to cut down 40 lights worth of plants at a time.
[41:25.580 --> 41:29.380]  It would dry up to be about 75 to 85 pounds of weed.
[41:30.020 --> 41:31.140]  Imagine trimming that.
[41:31.980 --> 41:32.180]  Yeah.
[41:32.340 --> 41:33.100]  Like, yeah.
[41:33.140 --> 41:35.020]  But where are you going to hang it to dry it?
[41:35.260 --> 41:36.060]  Oh fuck.
[41:36.060 --> 41:37.260]  That's such a pain in the ass.
[41:37.260 --> 41:37.740]  Yeah.
[41:38.140 --> 41:38.620]  Yeah.
[41:39.300 --> 41:39.460]  Yeah.
[41:39.460 --> 41:42.060]  This is, and this is part of why you have to have space.
[41:42.060 --> 41:46.220]  You have to have a dehumidifier, a humidifier, an air conditioner and a fan.
[41:46.460 --> 41:47.580]  All fighting each other.
[41:47.900 --> 41:53.500]  See, there's always problems in a grow the size because either you're not new stuff
[41:53.500 --> 41:57.500]  always comes up, even if you're doing your job, especially if you're doing your job
[41:57.500 --> 41:59.460]  very well, new problems come up.
[41:59.540 --> 42:02.380]  You know, it's you always got problems.
[42:02.460 --> 42:02.700]  Yeah.
[42:02.740 --> 42:04.220]  Where are we going to put all this weed?
[42:04.260 --> 42:05.540]  Seems to be part of the problem.
[42:05.740 --> 42:06.900]  This weed is we haven't.
[42:07.060 --> 42:07.460]  Yeah.
[42:07.740 --> 42:07.900]  Yeah.
[42:07.900 --> 42:12.020]  So, and you can't back crops up in the dry and cure room because if you've got this
[42:12.020 --> 42:14.820]  one, that's almost ready to go into the containers and then you bring in this
[42:14.860 --> 42:16.060]  fresh one that just got cut down.
[42:16.060 --> 42:18.660]  You're just going to re moisten all of those other buds.
[42:18.820 --> 42:22.140]  So there's so many challenges, things you're gonna have to think about when it
[42:22.140 --> 42:24.140]  comes time to build your large facility.
[42:24.140 --> 42:27.500]  You guys, this episode started off with an idea of talking about the differences
[42:27.500 --> 42:29.820]  between why it's so easy outdoors.
[42:29.940 --> 42:30.460]  It's not.
[42:30.700 --> 42:33.260]  And why it's so much more challenging indoors because every piece of
[42:33.260 --> 42:35.380]  equipment you put in there, you got to put another piece of equipment.
[42:35.700 --> 42:37.780]  Uh, if you put in a light, you got to put in a cooling a piece.
[42:37.780 --> 42:40.460]  So when you put in cooling, that makes heat outsides and now you got to, it
[42:40.460 --> 42:42.340]  just, it all backs up on itself.
[42:42.620 --> 42:44.140]  And then you got to make sure the power is safe.
[42:44.180 --> 42:45.300]  Please don't burn down your house.
[42:45.300 --> 42:47.780]  Trying to run too many amps on one breaker.
[42:48.060 --> 42:48.940]  Oh, please don't.
[42:49.060 --> 42:49.260]  Yeah.
[42:49.620 --> 42:51.820]  We've seen some scary things melt and shit like that.
[42:51.820 --> 42:54.980]  Then it turned into us kind of talking about just random grow industry stuff.
[42:54.980 --> 42:57.420]  So I hope you guys enjoyed hanging out, listening to this podcast, bro.
[42:57.420 --> 43:00.420]  You got any stuff you want to ramble about since we've got you here on the
[43:00.420 --> 43:02.140]  podcast and you don't come over often enough.
[43:02.140 --> 43:02.740]  For sure.
[43:02.780 --> 43:06.660]  Um, I'm actually really stoked about my market farm business.
[43:06.820 --> 43:13.660]  Uh, me and Derek from the Colorado podcast, the summer, um, for years,
[43:13.820 --> 43:17.860]  I listened to podcasts a lot while I'm working in big grows.
[43:18.220 --> 43:22.300]  Um, and it kind of turned towards some podcasts that were centered
[43:22.300 --> 43:24.220]  on urban farming and small farming.
[43:24.780 --> 43:28.940]  Um, and Derek would listen to him with me and I always talk shit and I was like,
[43:28.940 --> 43:31.140]  I could do that fucking shit, you know, this and that.
[43:31.140 --> 43:36.900]  And so this spring I decided to put my, uh, you know, to, to actually do it.
[43:37.220 --> 43:40.540]  Um, shut up saying I can do it and show that I can do it.
[43:41.180 --> 43:44.260]  So we've been farming, uh, 800 square feet.
[43:44.780 --> 43:45.140]  Yes.
[43:45.140 --> 43:47.540]  I said farming and 800 square feet.
[43:49.220 --> 43:53.700]  Um, fuck dude, we've, uh, we've had some beds have turned over four times.
[43:54.180 --> 43:58.860]  Uh, I had produce available and for sale before most of the commercial
[43:58.860 --> 44:02.260]  farmers out in the County, even fucking had seed in the field.
[44:02.460 --> 44:02.900]  Nice.
[44:02.940 --> 44:05.580]  Um, we've probably grown about 300 pounds of food so far.
[44:05.660 --> 44:06.180]  Excellent.
[44:06.380 --> 44:09.100]  Uh, he brought me a nice, uh, some groceries.
[44:09.100 --> 44:10.260]  It looks like I went shopping.
[44:10.620 --> 44:13.100]  I was nice and lush, nice and green sticking out all the bags.
[44:13.100 --> 44:13.820]  It looks delicious.
[44:13.820 --> 44:15.300]  That's going to be part of my dinner tonight.
[44:15.300 --> 44:15.980]  So thank you, man.
[44:15.980 --> 44:16.740]  I appreciate that.
[44:16.860 --> 44:18.140]  I appreciate you eating it.
[44:18.220 --> 44:18.580]  Oh, dude.
[44:18.580 --> 44:21.140]  It's always nice eating things that were grown right across town by somebody
[44:21.140 --> 44:22.420]  that, you know, put some love into it.
[44:22.540 --> 44:24.460]  Super, super organic.
[44:24.460 --> 44:27.220]  Although I can't use that word cause the government stole it from us.
[44:27.300 --> 44:31.860]  Um, but, uh, it's fueled by compost and worm castings.
[44:32.020 --> 44:34.340]  So it's, it's, you know, that's pretty much it.
[44:34.620 --> 44:39.300]  Um, I put down a little bit of bio live from, uh, down to earth.
[44:39.540 --> 44:39.820]  Okay.
[44:39.940 --> 44:43.660]  We threw some, a little of that down early in the season, a little kelp mill too.
[44:44.140 --> 44:44.660]  Excellent.
[44:44.860 --> 44:45.780]  But yeah, that's it.
[44:46.020 --> 44:48.660]  So, so where, uh, where can locals find you?
[44:48.660 --> 44:51.180]  I've seen you set up at the, uh, the farmer's market that I work in.
[44:51.300 --> 44:52.780]  People come find you your produce.
[44:52.900 --> 44:57.860]  Uh, we do, uh, um, we've got one more market this year that is already planned.
[44:58.020 --> 45:01.340]  Uh, it's the Belmont market at the Christ congregational church.
[45:01.900 --> 45:03.220]  Uh, here in Pueblo.
[45:03.340 --> 45:08.020]  Um, other than that, like we didn't make a commitment to a full scale.
[45:08.340 --> 45:10.700]  Farmer's market this year, cause it was our first year.
[45:10.700 --> 45:11.820]  I didn't know what to expect.
[45:12.260 --> 45:14.620]  I didn't want most of the time farmers markets.
[45:14.700 --> 45:16.740]  They don't just want vendors coming and going.
[45:16.860 --> 45:19.700]  Oh, they need a commitment from you for the full season.
[45:19.700 --> 45:21.140]  So they know they got that booth sold.
[45:21.140 --> 45:26.500]  And yeah, so I, you know, I had some doubt myself, uh, about a few things and,
[45:26.500 --> 45:29.460]  uh, you know, just the nature of learning a new business.
[45:29.500 --> 45:30.780]  I didn't want to commit to that.
[45:30.780 --> 45:35.140]  So we're not at a steady market yet, but we have a Facebook page.
[45:35.580 --> 45:39.340]  Hit us up there and, uh, we will totally ship you over some
[45:39.340 --> 45:41.620]  veggies, uh, anywhere here in Pueblo.
[45:41.780 --> 45:43.580]  That's Alma Verde farms.
[45:44.300 --> 45:47.820]  Uh, that's a L M a Verde, like color green.
[45:47.940 --> 45:48.820]  So check it out.
[45:48.820 --> 45:52.620]  You guys support the local, local vegetables, local produce.
[45:52.700 --> 45:53.900]  It's good stuff grown by my buddy.
[45:54.060 --> 45:55.940]  Next year, we're going to be on an acre.
[45:56.180 --> 45:58.660]  Uh, pretty much.
[45:59.060 --> 46:01.900]  Finished up a deal to rent an acre.
[46:01.900 --> 46:03.900]  That's got water on it out in the County.
[46:04.540 --> 46:09.220]  So, um, yeah, we're, uh, if we can get our funding figured out,
[46:09.220 --> 46:11.460]  cause this stuff is not cheap, right?
[46:11.540 --> 46:13.660]  People forget that farming costs a lot of money.
[46:13.660 --> 46:14.020]  Yeah.
[46:14.100 --> 46:15.940]  Uh, we get our funding figured out.
[46:15.940 --> 46:20.460]  We're going to be farming anywhere from a quarter to a half acre, uh, with
[46:20.460 --> 46:23.980]  plans for a third year to expand into the full acre, so excellent.
[46:24.220 --> 46:24.460]  Yeah.
[46:24.620 --> 46:26.060]  I wish you, wish you luck with that one, bro.
[46:26.060 --> 46:26.660]  I hope it goes well.
[46:26.780 --> 46:29.140]  I look forward to more of those fresh veggies for sure.

[46:41.700 --> 46:43.140]  I was going to say you're doing so much stuff.
[46:43.180 --> 46:44.540]  We weren't that good at it anyway.
[46:44.540 --> 46:45.460]  So it was fun to listen to.
[46:45.980 --> 46:47.380]  It's had a guy named fetus on there.
[46:47.660 --> 46:48.260]  Oh, fuck.

[47:34.260 --> 47:36.540]  You guys, I just took a dab of coffee nectar.
[47:36.540 --> 47:38.780]  It's labeled alien Kush and alien.
[47:38.780 --> 47:43.700]  Oh, gee, the flavor is described as a dark roast coffee and watermelon candy.
[47:44.180 --> 47:46.300]  I definitely get the dark roast coffee.
[47:46.300 --> 47:49.380]  There's no watermelon candy on my palate, but it did taste
[47:49.380 --> 47:52.020]  like a creamy mocha coffee.
[47:52.380 --> 47:53.340]  It was really delicious.
[47:53.340 --> 47:55.620]  I've never had a dab that tasted like coffee before.
[47:56.020 --> 47:57.820]  Great work by green dot labs.
