[00:45.160 --> 00:48.920]  You know I like to start the podcast off by talking about what I'm smoking.
[00:48.920 --> 00:54.400]  Today, I've been taking dabs of Malibu Purikush Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms.
[00:54.400 --> 01:02.400]  On the package, it says the product contains 72.9% THC and 84.7% total cannabinoids.
[01:02.400 --> 01:05.360]  We talked about the Malibu Purikush on the last episode.
[01:05.360 --> 01:10.680]  I really love the flavor, the aroma, and of course, I love the buzz from the kush.
[01:10.680 --> 01:16.900]  So big shout out to my friends at Apothecary Farms for the delicious Malibu Purikush Ambrosia.
[01:16.900 --> 01:21.280]  In this episode, I'm going to do a strain feature on my strain Double Dragon.
[01:21.280 --> 01:24.800]  Before we get there, let's do some shout outs to a few of the folks who support the
[01:24.800 --> 01:26.960]  show on Patreon.
[01:26.960 --> 01:31.440]  Let's start off by rolling up a big fat joint, lighten it up, and pass it over to Ms. Mel.
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.520]  I also want to roll a big fat joint, light that fucker up, and pass it over to my friend
[01:35.520 --> 01:37.240]  the Corporate Rebel.
[01:37.240 --> 01:40.920]  Then I want to pack a big fresh bong load and pass that fucker over to my buddy Bong
[01:40.920 --> 01:42.120]  Breath.
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.040]  Then let's roll a big fat blunt and put a snake of shatter down the middle of it, light
[01:46.040 --> 01:49.320]  that up, and pass it over to my buddy Bafsta.
[01:49.360 --> 01:53.600]  After that, let's get too big of a dab and heat up a dab nail and pass that fucker over
[01:53.600 --> 01:57.040]  to my buddy Stabby McStabwood and watch him cough for a couple of minutes.
[01:57.040 --> 01:58.760]  Big shout out to Stabby.
[01:58.760 --> 02:03.920]  Then let's smoke some really good high quality rosin with my buddy Ned Denver.
[02:03.920 --> 02:07.840]  Then let's roll up a big fat joint and maybe sprinkle some keef down the middle of it and
[02:07.840 --> 02:11.000]  light that up and pass it over to my buddy Redbeard.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.660]  Then I want to roll a king size joint of this super dankest weed, light that up and pass
[02:15.660 --> 02:18.760]  it over to my brand new friend Mr. Popperoni.
[02:19.200 --> 02:23.360]  Then let's get crazy, let's roll up a blunt and wrap a snake of shatter around the outside
[02:23.360 --> 02:27.160]  of it, maybe put a little bit of keef down the middle of it, light that fucker up and
[02:27.160 --> 02:30.840]  let's pass it over to my new friend Deronti.
[02:30.840 --> 02:35.800]  Big thanks, big shout out, big smoky high fives and fist bumps to everybody who supports
[02:35.800 --> 02:37.440]  the show on Patreon.

[02:48.880 --> 02:55.440]  and I did include a link in the show notes and the video description for my stoner friends.
[02:55.440 --> 02:58.960]  All right ladies and gentlemen, I did say that I was going to do a strain feature on
[02:58.960 --> 03:02.600]  Double Dragon, so let's jump right into it.
[03:02.600 --> 03:04.080]  What is Double Dragon?
[03:04.080 --> 03:10.260]  Double Dragon is a cross of my Arise male cross to a Durban Poison female.
[03:10.260 --> 03:12.960]  So let's talk briefly about my Arise male.
[03:12.960 --> 03:16.240]  My Arise is a Golden Goat to Daybreaker cross.
[03:16.240 --> 03:20.520]  Golden Goat has a really sweet tropical sort of a flavor, kind of a sativa dominant head
[03:20.520 --> 03:22.120]  buzz to that plant.
[03:22.120 --> 03:26.120]  Then on the other side, we've got the Daybreaker that is Chem D to Joseph OG.
[03:26.120 --> 03:29.680]  So we've got Chem Dog aromas, we've got OG Kush aromas.
[03:29.680 --> 03:34.000]  It's got funk to it, it's got Kush, it's got gas, it's got fuel, it's got some odd funky
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.920]  aromas which I really enjoy.
[03:35.920 --> 03:40.440]  It makes gigantic leaves and it's got that more punch you in the face, sit you down kind
[03:40.440 --> 03:41.440]  of a buzz.
[03:41.440 --> 03:46.160]  Also by crossing the Golden Goat and the Daybreaker, there was a lot of contrast in those two plants.
[03:46.160 --> 03:51.040]  I knew I could make a really vigorous and a really new hybrid, so I crossed those.
[03:51.040 --> 03:53.400]  That creation was known as Arise.
[03:53.400 --> 03:55.560]  I've done a full episode about Arise.
[03:55.560 --> 03:58.960]  If you search Grow From Your Heart Arise, it will pop up very quickly.
[03:58.960 --> 04:01.780]  Check that episode out, learn all about Arise.
[04:01.780 --> 04:08.200]  The male that I used in this cross for Double Dragon was a specially selected male Arise
[04:08.200 --> 04:10.880]  plant who has been called King Solomon.
[04:10.880 --> 04:15.000]  King Solomon has made many, many successful crosses.
[04:15.000 --> 04:19.520]  Everything he touches, he puts more resin on the outcome, he puts more vigor into the
[04:19.520 --> 04:20.520]  outcome.
[04:20.520 --> 04:23.440]  King Solomon has become known as the plant fixer.
[04:23.440 --> 04:28.080]  If you've got a female plant that grows well but it's got a problem, you can probably pollinate
[04:28.080 --> 04:32.440]  it with King Solomon and we will fix it and make that plant the offspring will be even
[04:32.440 --> 04:35.920]  better than both plants which is the goal in breeding.
[04:35.920 --> 04:40.160]  So King Solomon passes on high THC and great potency.
[04:40.200 --> 04:42.560]  He also passes on hyper vigor.
[04:42.560 --> 04:47.800]  He also passes on a very nice structure and he also gives very good resistance to mold
[04:47.800 --> 04:51.280]  and mildew, so it is a great male plant to work with.
[04:51.280 --> 04:53.620]  Now let's talk about the other side of this cross.
[04:53.620 --> 04:57.600]  The female in this cross I used was a Durban Poison.
[04:57.600 --> 05:02.600]  There is a Durban Poison cut that travels through the Colorado commercial grow industry
[05:02.600 --> 05:04.760]  and that is the exact cut that I used.
[05:04.760 --> 05:10.280]  If you have purchased Durban Poison in Colorado in the past couple of years, especially in
[05:10.280 --> 05:16.080]  the Southern Colorado area, it was probably grown from the exact cut which I am using.
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.360]  It's got that black licorice, anise smell to it, a little bit of sweetness depending
[05:20.360 --> 05:23.260]  on what nutrients it's grown with and how it's done.
[05:23.260 --> 05:26.160]  Sometimes it gets a little funkier, sometimes it gets a little sweeter.
[05:26.160 --> 05:30.080]  If they do it just right, that anise and licorice smell really, really pops.
[05:30.080 --> 05:34.560]  When you smoke it, it brings out maybe a hint of mint in the flavor but it stays real anise
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.000]  and licorice-y and it's got that mint sort of an aftertaste to it.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  If you do it right, it is such a head ripper.
[05:42.000 --> 05:43.480]  It will rip your head off.
[05:43.480 --> 05:47.820]  I've noticed the THCA tests don't come out super high on the Durban Poison but when I
[05:47.820 --> 05:50.660]  smoke it, I get fucking high from it.
[05:50.660 --> 05:54.000]  I get higher from the Durban Poison than a lot of other strains.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.880]  I've noticed when I smoke the Durban Poison and also the Double Dragon that my eyes get
[05:58.880 --> 06:00.280]  bloody, bloody red.
[06:00.280 --> 06:01.840]  It does something to my eyes.
[06:01.840 --> 06:04.920]  It's almost like a psychedelic panic attack sort of a high.
[06:04.920 --> 06:06.860]  For some people, it can be overwhelming.
[06:06.860 --> 06:09.960]  That sounds a little unappealing or unappetizing.
[06:09.960 --> 06:11.880]  For me, that is right where I want to be.
[06:11.880 --> 06:15.560]  If you can get me right to that level where I'm like, oh shit, that's how high I want
[06:15.560 --> 06:17.600]  to be is, oh shit, I like that.
[06:17.600 --> 06:18.720]  When you're like, what was I doing?
[06:18.720 --> 06:19.720]  Where am I?
[06:19.720 --> 06:20.720]  I'm lost.
[06:20.720 --> 06:22.000]  That's what I'm smoking for sometimes.
[06:22.000 --> 06:23.120]  That's what I enjoy.
[06:23.120 --> 06:27.280]  You can get that from the Durban Poison and you can absolutely get that from the Double
[06:27.280 --> 06:28.280]  Dragon.
[06:28.280 --> 06:34.200]  The cross is the female Double Dragon crossed to the male Arise plant, which was known as
[06:34.200 --> 06:35.200]  King Solomon.
[06:35.200 --> 06:36.880]  So those are the parents.
[06:36.880 --> 06:40.780]  So a moment ago, I called King Solomon the plant fixer.
[06:40.780 --> 06:44.100]  If I've got a plant that doesn't grow the way I want it to, or it doesn't produce the
[06:44.100 --> 06:47.920]  way I need it to, or it's just lacking in something, maybe it's got all the turps, but
[06:47.920 --> 06:48.960]  not the potency.
[06:48.960 --> 06:51.320]  Maybe it's got all the potency and not the turps.
[06:51.320 --> 06:52.600]  Maybe it grows funny.
[06:52.600 --> 06:57.560]  I can pollinate it with King Solomon and nine times out of 10, the outcome will be
[06:57.560 --> 07:00.440]  better than both parent plants.
[07:00.440 --> 07:03.800]  And I will do what I have called fixing the original plant.
[07:03.800 --> 07:08.600]  So in this case, I had that Durban Poison cut and there were a couple of things I did
[07:08.600 --> 07:10.420]  not like about that cut.
[07:10.420 --> 07:14.560]  The main thing I didn't like is just the way that it grew, the structure, the way the plant
[07:14.560 --> 07:18.240]  branched out, the way it grew kind of sideways, the way it kind of branched out weird.
[07:18.240 --> 07:19.520]  It didn't go straight up.
[07:19.520 --> 07:21.100]  It wanted to make viney branches.
[07:21.100 --> 07:24.060]  It needed a lot of work, a lot of support, a lot of attention.
[07:24.060 --> 07:26.780]  It wasn't working well in a commercial environment.
[07:26.780 --> 07:27.820]  We kept growing it.
[07:27.820 --> 07:28.820]  We worked with it.
[07:28.820 --> 07:33.020]  I could make it work and to grow because people really wanted that Durban Poison.
[07:33.020 --> 07:35.620]  It has a good reputation and it flies off the shelf.
[07:35.620 --> 07:40.620]  So it was worth the pain in the ass grow, but I knew I could fix it by breeding it to
[07:40.620 --> 07:42.500]  my King Solomon.
[07:42.500 --> 07:48.340]  So my main goal was to improve the structure and shape of that plant and improve the way
[07:48.340 --> 07:49.340]  the branches grow.
[07:49.340 --> 07:51.060]  I guess that is just the shape and structure.
[07:52.020 --> 07:56.500]  I wanted to make it a more vigorous, more commercially viable plant is what I think
[07:56.500 --> 07:57.500]  my goal was.
[07:57.500 --> 08:00.940]  I love that Durban Poison, but in a commercial environment, it slowed us down.
[08:00.940 --> 08:05.300]  We did not reach goals because of it, but it was so amazingly flavorful and potent that
[08:05.300 --> 08:06.620]  we kept it around.
[08:06.620 --> 08:09.320]  So my main goal was to fix that growth.
[08:09.320 --> 08:14.380]  My second goal was to keep that Durban Poison flavor and aroma in the cross.
[08:14.380 --> 08:19.740]  And my third hope was that we would get that amazing Durban Poison head ripper buzz, that
[08:19.740 --> 08:24.620]  super slanty eyes, the red eyes, the amazing cotton mouth, the time travel high.
[08:24.620 --> 08:27.620]  I was hoping we would get that out of the cross.
[08:27.620 --> 08:32.920]  And in most phenotypes, I do find that we get that Durban Poison flavor.
[08:32.920 --> 08:38.500]  Most of them have that rip and rip and high, and they all grow quite a bit better than
[08:38.500 --> 08:40.360]  that original Durban Poison cross.
[08:40.360 --> 08:42.220]  So I feel like I did hit my goal.
[08:42.220 --> 08:48.000]  However, there are more phenotypes than I anticipated or expected in this breeding project.
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.060]  Most of the time, I see two or three, maybe three or four solid phenotypes that I can
[08:52.060 --> 08:54.020]  kind of categorize and identify.
[08:54.020 --> 08:57.220]  I can say, oh, those traits are happening because of this parent.
[08:57.220 --> 08:58.700]  That's happening because of this parent.
[08:58.700 --> 09:02.860]  I see quite a bit of variation in the double dragon.
[09:02.860 --> 09:06.780]  Keep in mind that this is just the F1 version of the double dragon that I'm playing with.
[09:06.780 --> 09:08.620]  I have not made F2s yet.
[09:08.620 --> 09:13.300]  I will be able to lock in phenotypes and lock in traits as I so desire.
[09:13.300 --> 09:16.600]  I just have not made that step into the project yet.
[09:16.600 --> 09:19.180]  So at this point, I am seeing several phenotypes.
[09:19.180 --> 09:21.620]  We will discuss the phenotypes in just a little bit.
[09:21.620 --> 09:23.900]  Let's talk more about growing the plant.
[09:23.900 --> 09:28.580]  Double dragon is a very fast and very vigorously growing plant.
[09:28.580 --> 09:33.780]  I say that a lot about most of the strains I put out, but it is an F1 hybrid, so it does
[09:33.780 --> 09:35.500]  contain that hyper vigor.
[09:35.500 --> 09:39.820]  And also, King Solomon gives plants extra hyper vigor.
[09:39.820 --> 09:41.980]  So it's going to grow very quickly.
[09:41.980 --> 09:45.820]  Now something I find interesting about some of the phenotypes of this plant is that it
[09:45.840 --> 09:49.760]  wants to get stretchy and grow horizontally instead of vertically.
[09:49.760 --> 09:54.360]  It wants to go out and stretch sideways and get wider instead of growing up and getting
[09:54.360 --> 09:55.360]  taller.
[09:55.360 --> 10:00.600]  So some of these phenotypes will require some sort of sticks or netting or tomato cages
[10:00.600 --> 10:02.400]  or something to make it grow up.
[10:02.400 --> 10:07.160]  Otherwise, you'll just have a low-lying bush that keeps going out and sideways.
[10:07.160 --> 10:11.680]  If that is what you want, that will work beautifully for you, but that is not what most cannabis
[10:11.680 --> 10:13.760]  growers are looking for.
[10:13.820 --> 10:17.260]  Goldor has a phenotype that is quite stretchy and it kind of moves around a lot.
[10:17.260 --> 10:22.100]  It's a little bit branchy, but it works beautifully for his vertical grow and his trellis style
[10:22.100 --> 10:23.100]  system.
[10:23.100 --> 10:26.300]  So different phenotypes will work beautifully in different environments.
[10:26.300 --> 10:31.260]  But be prepared because some of them will get stretchy and they will get a little branchy.
[10:31.260 --> 10:34.780]  And when you put them into flower, they really will stretch.
[10:34.780 --> 10:40.500]  The 21-day stretch is crazy on this plant, but you can mitigate that by doing popping
[10:40.500 --> 10:41.500]  and twisting.
[10:41.500 --> 10:45.320]  You can pop and twist the branches and crunch them up during the first three weeks of flower.
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.300]  That really slows down that lateral growth and it will not put any harm to your flowers.
[10:50.300 --> 10:52.120]  We're not building flowers at this time.
[10:52.120 --> 10:54.160]  The plant is just kicking into flower mode.
[10:54.160 --> 10:57.380]  Go ahead, crunch, pop, twist, bend, work all those stems.
[10:57.380 --> 11:00.840]  Give it all those knuckles, make it nice and tough, but keep it nice and low so that it
[11:00.840 --> 11:05.360]  doesn't grow too tall too quickly because it does want to take off on you.
[11:05.360 --> 11:09.980]  Now I know I say this about almost every strain that I put out, but you're going to need some
[11:09.980 --> 11:10.980]  sort of supports.
[11:11.460 --> 11:12.960]  You're going to need to lift the plant up.
[11:12.960 --> 11:15.300]  Also, it's going to get giant buds.
[11:15.300 --> 11:18.420]  Everything that comes from Solomon makes pretty large buds.
[11:18.420 --> 11:21.900]  This Durban poison plant made fairly large buds from the beginning.
[11:21.900 --> 11:24.860]  So you are going to see potentially gigantic buds.
[11:24.860 --> 11:29.640]  Be prepared, have some sticks, have an extra trellis net, have some way to support those
[11:29.640 --> 11:30.640]  giant buds.
[11:30.640 --> 11:34.180]  You don't want to walk in there on week five and find out that one of those big ass branches
[11:34.180 --> 11:38.260]  snapped because your colas were so damn big.
[11:38.260 --> 11:40.700]  Now these plants are going to grow quickly in veg.
[11:41.420 --> 11:43.020]  They will grow very quickly in flower.
[11:43.020 --> 11:49.220]  I have noticed that these plants like a little bit less water than most plants.
[11:49.220 --> 11:54.260]  I've noticed that if I water one gallon every day on all of my other plants, that the double
[11:54.260 --> 11:58.660]  dragon plants can probably take half to three quarters of a gallon.
[11:58.660 --> 12:00.580]  This will be phenotype specific.
[12:00.580 --> 12:02.300]  This will be environment specific.
[12:02.300 --> 12:05.820]  Don't just give your plants less water because I said it may work.
[12:05.820 --> 12:10.820]  Pay attention, you may notice that some of your double dragon plants don't drink as much
[12:10.820 --> 12:14.300]  and as often as many of your other plants.
[12:14.300 --> 12:20.660]  Also they tend to like a little bit of a higher temperature and a drier environment.
[12:20.660 --> 12:23.480]  I think that that is coming from the Durban poison.
[12:23.480 --> 12:26.780]  It comes from an African region where it is hot and dry.
[12:26.780 --> 12:27.780]  So it makes sense.
[12:27.780 --> 12:32.380]  They also probably have less water in the region where this plant originates.
[12:32.380 --> 12:36.940]  So the plant wants less water, a warmer and drier environment.
[12:36.940 --> 12:42.100]  I have also noticed that some phenotypes of the double dragon will tolerate and possibly
[12:42.100 --> 12:47.580]  enjoy a higher pH than some of the other plants in the garden.
[12:47.580 --> 12:51.340]  So if you are noticing issues with these plants and you think they're not uptaking their food
[12:51.340 --> 12:56.620]  properly, you may need to increase the pH of your feeding solution and that may help
[12:56.620 --> 12:58.980]  with your double dragon plants.
[12:58.980 --> 13:02.480]  Now I should mention that double dragon is kind of a picky plant.
[13:02.480 --> 13:05.200]  Some of the phenotypes can be a little bit finicky.
[13:05.200 --> 13:10.340]  The thinner leaved phenotypes are the more problematic plants is what I have noticed.
[13:10.340 --> 13:15.260]  They are harder to diagnose when they do fuck up and they are more prone to having problems.
[13:15.260 --> 13:19.740]  I don't know if that comes from the golden goat because golden goat is always macro deficient.
[13:19.740 --> 13:22.020]  I don't know if that comes from the Durban poison.
[13:22.020 --> 13:25.300]  I don't know if it's just those two genetics going, hey, we're from completely different
[13:25.300 --> 13:26.740]  parts of the fucking world.
[13:26.740 --> 13:29.540]  They're trying to make us happy in a commercial cultivation environment.
[13:29.540 --> 13:31.240]  We're not sure what to do.
[13:31.240 --> 13:34.500]  So it could be from the golden goat always being macro deficient.
[13:34.500 --> 13:37.540]  You guys, if you're growing golden goat, if you're growing golden goat crosses, if you're
[13:37.540 --> 13:43.140]  growing a rise crosses, there's a good likelihood that you're going to find macro nutrient deficiencies
[13:43.140 --> 13:48.060]  early in flower and that is probably coming from the hyper vigor of these plants.
[13:48.060 --> 13:52.100]  They're just using all of the nutrients so they need a little bit more.
[13:52.100 --> 13:55.920]  But I should mention that some of the phenotypes that come from double dragon can be a real
[13:55.920 --> 13:56.920]  pain in the ass.
[13:56.920 --> 14:00.160]  This is not a plant that I would recommend for beginning growers.
[14:00.160 --> 14:01.880]  This is more for an advanced grower.
[14:01.880 --> 14:03.720]  This is a longer flowering plant.
[14:03.720 --> 14:09.240]  We're going to have nine to 10, maybe even 11 week finishing phenotypes.
[14:09.240 --> 14:12.080]  Most phenotypes are going to finish around week nine.
[14:12.080 --> 14:13.780]  Some will finish around week 10.
[14:13.780 --> 14:17.840]  You are going to have longer finishing phenotypes.
[14:17.840 --> 14:18.920]  Don't discredit that.
[14:18.920 --> 14:19.920]  I mean it.
[14:19.920 --> 14:22.720]  There will be outliers that take 11 weeks.
[14:22.720 --> 14:27.160]  And again, those longer flowering plants, those skinnier leaf plants, those taller thinner
[14:27.160 --> 14:29.040]  plants, they have that crazy buzz.
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.200]  They will get you psychedelic tripping high, but also they're kind of a pain in the ass
[14:33.200 --> 14:34.200]  to grow.
[14:34.200 --> 14:37.600]  So I recommend those phenotypes for a more experienced grower.
[14:37.600 --> 14:41.680]  If you get a pack of double dragon and you're not a grow pro and you do find a couple of
[14:41.680 --> 14:46.000]  phenotypes, maybe stick with the one that grows easier for you.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  Maybe don't torture yourself and set yourself up for a struggle by picking that super sativa
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.200]  heavy phenotype and trying to fight that the entire time.
[14:53.200 --> 14:57.760]  Maybe pick one that is easier to grow because it will still give you a killer, killer buzz,
[14:57.760 --> 15:00.080]  and they will all have that amazing flavor.
[15:00.080 --> 15:04.880]  That feels like a good way to segue into talking about the flavors of most of the phenotypes.
[15:04.880 --> 15:09.040]  Then we'll talk about the buzz and also more specific phenotypes.
[15:09.040 --> 15:14.640]  What I have found is that most of the phenotypes carry that sweet, anise, licorice, kind of
[15:14.640 --> 15:16.600]  a minty sort of a flavor.
[15:16.600 --> 15:19.160]  Most of the phenotypes will have that to them.
[15:19.320 --> 15:24.400]  Many of the phenotypes will also have a sweet, tropical sort of a thing happening that comes
[15:24.400 --> 15:25.520]  from the golden goat.
[15:25.520 --> 15:31.160]  So it's a really good blend of the golden goat flavors and also the Durban poison flavors.
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.720]  Then also on the exhale, there's this hint of OG Kush that comes with it that leaves
[15:35.720 --> 15:40.080]  sort of a piney, mint, sweet, funky, tropical flavor on your mouth.
[15:40.080 --> 15:43.960]  It sounds like a lot of flavors, but when you smoke it, you'll go, oh, there it is.
[15:43.960 --> 15:47.400]  Because you get the flavor on the in, you get the flavor as you hold it, then you get
[15:47.400 --> 15:49.220]  another flavor as you exhale.
[15:49.220 --> 15:52.540]  Then if you're patient and you let the air move around in your mouth, you get an altogether
[15:52.540 --> 15:53.880]  different flavor.
[15:53.880 --> 15:57.840]  That's how I'm able to experience and enjoy all of these terpenes and aromas and flavors
[15:57.840 --> 15:59.080]  that come from the cannabis.
[15:59.080 --> 16:01.640]  That's how I'm able to give you such intense descriptions.
[16:01.640 --> 16:04.760]  I sit here and I taste it like a wine connoisseur, like a beer nerd.
[16:04.760 --> 16:07.480]  I'm over here making funny noises and smacking my lips.
[16:07.480 --> 16:09.880]  I really do my best to get the flavors out.
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.860]  So I noticed a lot of the Durban poison flavor in many phenotypes.
[16:13.860 --> 16:16.380]  Some of them carry that golden goat sweetness.
[16:16.380 --> 16:20.740]  Then some of the phenotypes even have that funky OG kush.
[16:20.740 --> 16:26.500]  Then there are outliers that are very OG kush dominant in the flavor and aroma.
[16:26.500 --> 16:30.900]  It feels like the anise and licorice kind of got pushed right to the very back.
[16:30.900 --> 16:34.980]  So you just get that kush and then that anise, and then at the end, there's a hint of like
[16:34.980 --> 16:37.180]  a mint leaf at the very end of it.
[16:37.180 --> 16:39.500]  So there are a lot of good flavors that come through it.
[16:40.500 --> 16:47.220]  Most of these phenotypes have a punch you in the face, fucking skyrocket, fucking handicap
[16:47.220 --> 16:49.300]  you for the whole day kind of a buzz.
[16:49.300 --> 16:51.700]  I can lose my keys when they're in my hand.
[16:51.700 --> 16:54.420]  I can lose my sunglasses while I'm wearing them.
[16:54.420 --> 16:57.100]  I can drive past my exit on the highway.
[16:57.100 --> 17:00.580]  I can do all kinds of dumb shit when I smoke Double Dragon.
[17:00.580 --> 17:07.300]  It is a really good kind of a time warp, psychedelic, sort of a fucking oh shit kind of a buzz.
[17:07.620 --> 17:09.900]  I've said it before on the show, that's what I love.
[17:09.900 --> 17:15.260]  I love that borderline panic attack that almost smoked myself into an anxiety problem.
[17:15.260 --> 17:16.620]  I really enjoy that.
[17:16.620 --> 17:20.580]  And I think you can tell if you walk up to me at Comedy Works and I am in the zone for
[17:20.580 --> 17:24.660]  a comedy show, I am right on the edge of, oh shit, because that's how I like to get
[17:24.660 --> 17:25.660]  right before a comedy show.
[17:25.660 --> 17:28.660]  And when the comedy starts, you settle in, you just laugh your ass off.
[17:28.660 --> 17:29.660]  It is beautiful.
[17:29.660 --> 17:30.660]  I'm talkative.
[17:30.660 --> 17:32.260]  I'm high as shit.
[17:32.260 --> 17:38.620]  Let's talk more specifically about the phenotypes that we will find in a pack of Double Dragon.
[17:38.620 --> 17:43.680]  Of course, we are going to find the Durban Poison Dominant phenotype.
[17:43.680 --> 17:49.540]  This one makes pine cone shaped buds, kind of spear shaped buds, tall, real sativa dominant,
[17:49.540 --> 17:54.860]  real classic sativa looking plants, nice leaf shapes, nice structure on the plant.
[17:54.860 --> 17:58.860]  Some of them, however, may have that weird floppy side branchy shit going on, but for
[17:58.860 --> 18:04.500]  the most part, they're going to be tall, pointy, sharp, spear pine cone looking buds,
[18:04.500 --> 18:06.520]  and most of them are bright green.
[18:06.520 --> 18:12.860]  The Durban Poison Dominant phenotypes are like bright, almost a neon green sort of a color.
[18:12.860 --> 18:15.380]  They don't get that dark color that the cushes get.
[18:15.380 --> 18:17.840]  So that is a really nice, noticeable difference.
[18:17.840 --> 18:20.560]  If you've got that bright, bright green, it could be from your nutrients, it could be
[18:20.560 --> 18:26.860]  from your lights, but in comparison, the bright, bright green is a little more Durban Dominant.
[18:26.860 --> 18:30.900]  Then of course, there is the Arise or Golden Goat Dominant phenotype.
[18:30.900 --> 18:36.140]  I see more Golden Goat than I do any of the OG Kush, any of the Joseph OG, any of the
[18:36.140 --> 18:37.900]  Chem D, any of the Daybreaker traits.
[18:37.900 --> 18:39.740]  I find more of the Golden Goat.
[18:39.740 --> 18:41.920]  You're going to get skinnier leaves here.
[18:41.920 --> 18:45.340]  These leaves are skinnier and they kind of taco a little bit right at the base where
[18:45.340 --> 18:48.520]  the petiole starts to spread off into the fingers of the leaves.
[18:48.520 --> 18:51.080]  They look a little bit crinkled, a little bit taco-y.
[18:51.080 --> 18:52.080]  That is normal.
[18:52.080 --> 18:53.480]  That is coming from the Golden Goat.
[18:53.480 --> 18:56.460]  And also, that plant is going to get macro deficient.
[18:56.460 --> 18:59.340]  No one is telling you, I'm going to be macro deficient.
[18:59.340 --> 19:05.180]  It doesn't get as light green as the Durban phenotype, but it does stay a little bit lighter
[19:05.180 --> 19:06.180]  green.
[19:06.180 --> 19:07.180]  It takes off growing.
[19:07.180 --> 19:08.900]  The Golden Goat phenotype really gets going.
[19:08.900 --> 19:10.380]  It gets kind of tall.
[19:10.380 --> 19:13.220]  Then there is the Kushy phenotype, which I talked about.
[19:13.220 --> 19:16.700]  It doesn't carry as much of the Durban and the Golden Goat aromas.
[19:16.700 --> 19:18.260]  It stays a little bit shorter.
[19:18.260 --> 19:19.940]  It stays a little bit more squat.
[19:19.940 --> 19:24.300]  Honestly, it's not the phenotype I was hoping to breed out of this project, but it's in
[19:24.300 --> 19:25.500]  there and it happens.
[19:25.540 --> 19:27.460]  I call it the Kushy phenotype.
[19:27.460 --> 19:28.460]  It's shorter.
[19:28.460 --> 19:29.460]  It's squatty.
[19:29.460 --> 19:35.020]  It also could come from some of the Romulan, also from the Golden Goat cross, but I think
[19:35.020 --> 19:36.620]  it's more Kushy dominant.
[19:36.620 --> 19:39.800]  Then there is one that I call the Fist phenotype.
[19:39.800 --> 19:43.340]  It makes buds that look like little fists or blockheads.
[19:43.340 --> 19:45.760]  I've also called it the Blockhead phenotype.
[19:45.760 --> 19:48.560]  For some reason, it doesn't grow pointy spears.
[19:48.560 --> 19:53.060]  It just grows chunks that look like sponges hanging off of the stick or a bunch of fists
[19:53.060 --> 19:54.460]  hanging off of the stick.
[19:54.460 --> 19:55.980]  That is a great phenotype.
[19:55.980 --> 20:02.220]  That one has a really delicious Durban poison flavor, a really nice Durban poison aroma.
[20:02.220 --> 20:06.380]  Then it brings in some of that Golden Goat sweetness, but the high is a little bit more
[20:06.380 --> 20:07.380]  heavier.
[20:07.380 --> 20:12.620]  It's got a little bit more indica to it than all of the other sativa dominant phenotypes.
[20:12.620 --> 20:15.020]  That one I call the Blockhead or the Fist.
[20:15.020 --> 20:16.700]  It gets really frosty.
[20:16.700 --> 20:18.180]  That one will get bigger leaves.
[20:18.180 --> 20:19.900]  You'll notice if you've got it.
[20:19.900 --> 20:23.120]  Then there is the one that I call the fucking Weirdo.
[20:23.160 --> 20:26.000]  That one grows out weird sideways vines.
[20:26.000 --> 20:27.960]  It grows real tall and spindly.
[20:27.960 --> 20:31.200]  It almost looks like some kind of vine you would find on the side of the house.
[20:31.200 --> 20:36.080]  It's really, really unique, but it is so potent.
[20:36.080 --> 20:37.840]  I've grown that one out a couple of times.
[20:37.840 --> 20:38.840]  It sucks to grow.
[20:38.840 --> 20:44.960]  It's no fun, but if you dry it and cure it and smoke it, your eyes get ... My eyes, I
[20:44.960 --> 20:46.100]  can't talk about yours.
[20:46.100 --> 20:49.880]  My eyes and everybody else I smoked it with were devil red.
[20:49.880 --> 20:51.720]  It just went straight to the eyes.
[20:51.720 --> 20:54.720]  It gave me the most intense cotton mouth.
[20:54.720 --> 20:57.520]  I was so high that it was weird.
[20:57.520 --> 21:01.760]  I was just like, bro, I haven't been this fucking high in a long time.
[21:01.760 --> 21:04.640]  You know when you're high, you have to just keep looking at all your friends going, bro,
[21:04.640 --> 21:06.160]  are you as fucking high as me?
[21:06.160 --> 21:07.900]  I'm a serious heavy smoker.
[21:07.900 --> 21:11.780]  This stuff had everybody looking around the room going, bro, I'm fucking baked, bro.
[21:11.780 --> 21:13.720]  People are looking at me like, what'd you put in that weed, man?
[21:13.720 --> 21:15.420]  I was like, it's just good weed, dude.
[21:15.420 --> 21:16.920]  It's one phenotype.
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.480]  Also, that phenotype doesn't put out for shit.
[21:20.520 --> 21:25.760]  The harvest weight on that psychedelic, crazy, branchy phenotype, it makes tiny little wispy
[21:25.760 --> 21:26.760]  buds.
[21:26.760 --> 21:31.520]  They're fluffy, they're airy, they suck, but they're coated in resin and it got me so incredibly
[21:31.520 --> 21:32.520]  high.
[21:32.520 --> 21:33.520]  That is the weirdo phenotype.
[21:33.520 --> 21:34.720]  It's kind of stretchy.
[21:34.720 --> 21:36.480]  It grows weird, floppy branches.
[21:36.480 --> 21:38.080]  It wants to go sideways.
[21:38.080 --> 21:42.600]  Also, if you accidentally bump one of those branches, they break right off the plant.
[21:42.600 --> 21:45.640]  I don't know what that is a trait from.
[21:45.640 --> 21:48.100]  It's not a strong plant, but that is one phenotype.
[21:48.100 --> 21:50.080]  It doesn't pop up very often.
[21:50.080 --> 21:51.080]  That is the fucking weirdo.
[21:51.080 --> 21:54.000]  It is not in the mix very commonly.
[21:54.000 --> 21:57.440]  I've probably seen it two out of a hundred seeds, so don't worry.
[21:57.440 --> 22:00.080]  You probably won't get that phenotype.
[22:00.080 --> 22:01.960]  There is the Durban phenotype.
[22:01.960 --> 22:05.320]  That one is going to take probably nine or 10 weeks.
[22:05.320 --> 22:06.760]  You've got the Golden Goat phenotype.
[22:06.760 --> 22:08.840]  That one's going to take you about nine weeks.
[22:08.840 --> 22:12.680]  The Cushy phenotype and the Fisty phenotype are about nine weekers.
[22:12.680 --> 22:16.960]  That weirdo, she likes to go 10, maybe a little bit more weeks.
[22:16.960 --> 22:19.480]  Then you're going to see the perfect blend.
[22:19.480 --> 22:24.560]  The goal I was going for, there is the blend of the Durban poison that crosses beautifully
[22:24.560 --> 22:25.560]  to the arise.
[22:25.560 --> 22:29.220]  It has got a beautiful Christmas tree-like structure.
[22:29.220 --> 22:32.000]  It grows one giant cola right up the center.
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.200]  The whole middle of the plant is going to be one big giant bud.
[22:35.200 --> 22:38.980]  Then you get a lot of nice side branching that all fills in real nice.
[22:38.980 --> 22:43.400]  The only downfall is there is a little bit of node spacing, a little bit of stretchiness,
[22:43.400 --> 22:47.320]  but I think that that is the sought-after, the desired phenotype.
[22:47.320 --> 22:50.280]  It has got all of that Durban poison flavor.
[22:50.280 --> 22:53.640]  It's got all the anise, the licorice, the mintiness.
[22:53.640 --> 22:55.800]  Then it's got some of that Golden Goat to it.
[22:55.800 --> 22:59.720]  Then it's got that, after you exhale, it's like, why is there a skunk in the air?
[22:59.720 --> 23:05.000]  You don't taste the skunk, but it smells tropical, minty, anise, licorice, and then skunk in
[23:05.000 --> 23:06.000]  the air.
[23:06.000 --> 23:08.400]  When people come into the room, they're like, are you smoking skunk?
[23:08.400 --> 23:09.520]  But you don't taste it.
[23:09.520 --> 23:11.640]  It's not in the flavor when you inhale or exhale.
[23:11.640 --> 23:13.560]  It just hangs in the room.
[23:13.920 --> 23:18.320]  The buzz from the 50-50 mix is exactly what I like.
[23:18.320 --> 23:20.440]  It's got me psychedelic high.
[23:20.440 --> 23:23.540]  It's got me real slant-eyed, real squinty-eyed.
[23:23.540 --> 23:27.240]  It's got me walking kind of slow and slowing down at green lights and fucking waiting for
[23:27.240 --> 23:32.640]  stop signs to turn green and shit, but it keeps me nice and social and it puts a silly
[23:32.640 --> 23:33.640]  grin on my face.
[23:33.640 --> 23:37.320]  You ever get stoned and you just, you can't help it, but you just make that stupid grin
[23:37.320 --> 23:40.320]  and somebody hates you for it because you got that stupid grin, but who cares?
[23:40.320 --> 23:41.840]  Good as it just feels good.
[23:41.840 --> 23:45.560]  It gives me that silly fucking stupid grin and I enjoy it.
[23:45.560 --> 23:50.880]  So you guys, I think those are the phenotypes that you are going to find in the double dragon.
[23:50.880 --> 23:52.720]  I really enjoy growing double dragon.
[23:52.720 --> 23:54.960]  I really love smoking double dragon.
[23:54.960 --> 23:58.160]  It makes crazy, crazy good concentrates.
[23:58.160 --> 24:01.280]  Most of the phenotypes are going to finish around nine or 10 weeks.
[24:01.280 --> 24:04.800]  Some phenotypes may go up to 11 weeks, but they are super potent.
[24:04.800 --> 24:06.800]  I find it to be worth it.
[24:06.800 --> 24:10.680]  Most of the phenotypes will give you pretty fat yields, nice heavy harvest.
[24:10.680 --> 24:15.080]  Most of them are super potent and all of them are going to taste amazing.
[24:15.080 --> 24:18.000]  So that is my report on double dragon.
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  That's my story.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  I'm sticking to it.
