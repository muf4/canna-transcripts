[01:31.200 --> 01:35.040]  everybody thank you for joining me this will be a one camera episode if you're
[01:35.040 --> 01:38.640]  watching the video there's only one camera today we are figuring out what
[01:38.640 --> 01:42.320]  the technical difficulty is with the other camera we'll get two cameras up
[01:42.320 --> 01:46.360]  and running pretty soon maybe just purchase another camera that may end up
[01:46.360 --> 01:50.560]  with sometimes three angles sometimes two angles I am already rambling this is
[01:50.560 --> 01:54.480]  going to be a good show I wanted to start by saying thank you in the last
[01:54.480 --> 01:58.320]  episode I asked a lot of people to I asked for people to subscribe to the
[01:58.320 --> 02:02.040]  channel I'm trying to get to 10,000 subscribers on YouTube before the new
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.520]  year a lot of people subscribed a lot of people shared that message thank you to
[02:06.520 --> 02:10.680]  everybody who subscribed thanks to everybody who already was subscribed and
[02:10.680 --> 02:15.040]  big thanks to everybody who shared my request for subscriptions I appreciate
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.760]  that big push thank you it was noticed there was an increase in numbers I do
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.520]  appreciate that also thank you for all of the feedback in the YouTube comments
[02:24.520 --> 02:27.840]  I have been checking out the comments a little bit more previously I talked
[02:27.840 --> 02:31.000]  about not reading those I've been making an effort to browse them a little
[02:31.000 --> 02:35.960]  bit more I do see that you guys prefer the longer episodes I prefer the longer
[02:35.960 --> 02:40.840]  episodes myself I think even when the camera does crap out the longer episodes
[02:40.840 --> 02:44.760]  are still more fun it takes a minute to get started I got to do the ads I got to
[02:44.760 --> 02:48.400]  do the intro I got to read the patreon stuff once I get settled in I really
[02:48.400 --> 02:52.080]  like flowing so I do think that I enjoy the longer episodes as well so I will do
[02:52.080 --> 02:56.600]  my best to get longer episodes coming to you but sometimes short sweet episodes
[02:56.600 --> 02:59.520]  are good and good good and good I said that not even gonna edit that they're
[02:59.520 --> 03:02.360]  good and sweet it's what you need just get right to the point get the lesson
[03:02.360 --> 03:05.800]  out get it out there some people say I ramble too much some people want longer
[03:05.800 --> 03:09.600]  shows I'm gonna make the show happen the way it goes do my best to make everybody
[03:09.600 --> 03:14.240]  happy I'm gonna do my thing we'll see how it works I'm gonna be super rambly
[03:14.240 --> 03:17.920]  through this episode I've been smoking all kinds of different dabs today we
[03:17.920 --> 03:21.640]  can't blame it on one day or the other put a lot of miles on the car did a lot
[03:21.640 --> 03:25.760]  of things smoked a lot of dabs saw a lot of people that's why I'm rambling lots
[03:25.760 --> 03:30.320]  of talking happened today um let's not ramble too much I did all the ads I
[03:30.320 --> 03:35.040]  covered all the patreon stuff I said thank you let's jump into the email
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.400]  portion of this podcast I've got a message here in front of me do they want
[03:39.400 --> 03:42.920]  their name said on the show this one came from our friend Zach big shout out
[03:42.920 --> 03:46.320]  to our buddy Zach if you have any questions the email address is grow
[03:46.320 --> 03:49.480]  from your heart at hotmail.com I would love to hear from you that's where this
[03:49.480 --> 03:53.320]  one came from our friend Zach says hey Ross to Jeff I started listening to your
[03:53.320 --> 03:58.240]  podcast around a month ago and I am so appreciative of all the information you
[03:58.240 --> 04:02.560]  give out I have learned so much hey thank you that's all I need is to hear
[04:02.560 --> 04:06.840]  that people are learning that makes it all worth the time effort energy knowing
[04:06.840 --> 04:10.280]  that you're learning something that you learned enough and felt like you should
[04:10.280 --> 04:12.800]  reach out and tell me so that means you're learning a lot that I'm
[04:12.800 --> 04:15.400]  connecting with you so thank you for the feedback thank you for watching
[04:15.400 --> 04:19.640]  listening I do appreciate it and thank you for the great question it goes on it
[04:19.640 --> 04:25.160]  says I've always wanted to do a small breeding project in my little 3x3 tent
[04:25.160 --> 04:29.640]  and I'm still trying out new strains before I really go in to a pheno hunt
[04:29.640 --> 04:34.560]  but years ago my buddy and I grew for the first time and we got our hands on
[04:34.560 --> 04:41.680]  some bog genetics big up bog genetics we got some but some bog bubble gum rest in
[04:41.680 --> 04:45.680]  peace to bushy old grower yes big rest in peace to bushy old grower if you guys
[04:45.680 --> 04:51.480]  ever see the name bog or the letters BOG in a grow forum or on seed forum or
[04:51.480 --> 04:56.840]  wherever you're getting seeds bog BOG is bushy old grower he was a really cool
[04:56.840 --> 05:01.800]  grower really cool breeder kind of a cantankerous old man not as cantankerous
[05:01.800 --> 05:07.000]  and outgoing and on re as sub cool but he still had some stuff to say he wasn't
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.720]  as outgoing on the online on the new types of Internet back in the day on IRC
[05:11.720 --> 05:16.280]  and stuff he did talk a little more I'm already rambling but bog is bushy old
[05:16.280 --> 05:19.680]  grower he taught us a lot he gave us a lot of great quality strains he did make
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.240]  a lot of great stuff big up to Mrs. Bog let me get back on track so our friend
[05:25.240 --> 05:28.720]  is talking about doing some breeding they're still searching for some strains
[05:28.720 --> 05:32.280]  they're still getting their their black belt in growing before they get into
[05:32.280 --> 05:36.480]  breeding then their first time they grew they got their hands on the bog bog
[05:36.480 --> 05:40.520]  bubble since then they've been hooked on all things bubble gum when it comes to
[05:40.520 --> 05:44.680]  cannabis and love trying things that are crossed with it that bubble gum turp
[05:44.680 --> 05:48.560]  and that bubble gum effect is great anything from I'm not sure if the bog
[05:48.560 --> 05:52.520]  bubble comes from the old Indiana bubble gum I didn't research that but anything
[05:52.520 --> 05:56.760]  from that Indiana bubble gum or true bubble gum line is tasty it tastes so
[05:56.760 --> 06:00.640]  good it's got that super stickiness to it which actually is why the bubble gum
[06:00.640 --> 06:04.320]  got its name it wasn't from the flavors or the aromas it was because it was so
[06:04.320 --> 06:08.200]  sticky that it was sticky like bubble gum is where bubble gum got its name so
[06:08.200 --> 06:11.800]  our friend is thinking about or talking about doing some breeding in the future
[06:11.800 --> 06:17.480]  they are in love with the bog bubble and all things bubble gum and bubble gum
[06:17.480 --> 06:21.320]  crosses now here's where we get into the question part it says I do not require a
[06:21.320 --> 06:25.880]  large quantity of cannabis and when I do decide to create some seeds I am purely
[06:25.880 --> 06:31.000]  looking for that euphoric giggly creeper what's it say creeper high that I
[06:31.000 --> 06:36.320]  remember from bog my question is what is the best way to select keepers in a
[06:36.320 --> 06:41.920]  breeding project if I'm only looking for specific effects that is a really
[06:41.920 --> 06:45.560]  good question you've got a goal so the goal is the most important part it says
[06:45.560 --> 06:49.760]  should I take small samples late in flower or decide purely based off the
[06:49.760 --> 06:55.080]  smell of the turps neither one of those you're going to have to completely
[06:55.080 --> 06:59.920]  finish your test samples dry them cure them and smoke them and if you're
[06:59.920 --> 07:05.360]  looking if you're judging your phenol hunt based purely on looking for the
[07:05.360 --> 07:10.920]  euphoric giggly creeper buzz you've got to grow them to full maturity maturity
[07:10.920 --> 07:16.440]  dry them cure them smoke them all of these things have to happen under the
[07:16.440 --> 07:20.800]  same scientific type conditions I understand you're in a 3x3 tent which
[07:20.800 --> 07:24.760]  actually kind of makes it better because that 3x3 tent is gives you much less
[07:24.760 --> 07:29.360]  variables that's only 3x3 you've only got that much space to have differences
[07:29.360 --> 07:33.600]  so you get your 3x3 I would grow as many seeds as you can fit in there and as
[07:33.600 --> 07:38.560]  legally I do them small grow them until you can get a clone get your clone then
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.760]  grow them all scientifically feed them all the same thing treat them all the
[07:42.760 --> 07:46.560]  same way give them all the same amount of light air humidity that's where the
[07:46.560 --> 07:50.240]  3x3 is cool it's very limited your variables are gonna be limited in there
[07:50.240 --> 07:55.880]  you've got to grow it harvest them you can harvest them at different times wait
[07:55.880 --> 07:58.880]  until you see the trichomes look the way that you would normally harvest wait so
[07:58.880 --> 08:03.120]  you feel like each plant is done harvest them dry and cure them the same way
[08:03.200 --> 08:09.640]  then smoke them I've got like I noticed that when I smoke if you guys watch any
[08:09.640 --> 08:13.000]  my live shows or if you know me you know that my office space is my favorite
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.840]  little smoking spot I've got a huge computer screen my favorite music is
[08:16.840 --> 08:21.240]  there my drink goes right here the dab rig is right here just like my home
[08:21.240 --> 08:24.680]  base that is my spot when I get home and wanna chill out and take some dabs and
[08:24.680 --> 08:29.000]  put on some music and relax that is the first spot I go got a nice cozy computer
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.160]  chair chillin out that is like my my test zone if I was gonna test new dabs
[08:34.160 --> 08:38.320]  new cannabis that would be the first place I would go my favorite smoking
[08:38.320 --> 08:42.880]  devices there my favorite music is there my comfortable chair is there my snacks
[08:42.880 --> 08:47.720]  are within reach I know that that is my zone I can get I can get wrecked in that
[08:47.720 --> 08:51.080]  zone and nothing can go wrong if anything does go wrong there's a couch
[08:51.080 --> 08:54.080]  on the other side of the room that I just I just basically crawl to the couch
[08:54.080 --> 08:57.760]  and everything will be okay I've got snacks I've got drinks I've got a couch
[08:57.760 --> 09:04.080]  I got music nothing can go wrong so that is my desired test environment if I had
[09:04.080 --> 09:08.120]  new product to test I would test it all there also I would try to test it all
[09:08.120 --> 09:12.600]  after a decent meal have some food in my stomach have some hydration not be
[09:12.600 --> 09:17.080]  exhausted not be too hyper not have any caffeinated beverages not too much sugar
[09:17.080 --> 09:20.640]  just kind of baseline you know belly full to where when you smoke it you're
[09:20.640 --> 09:24.200]  not gonna get instant munchies you got some blood sugar to handle something to
[09:24.200 --> 09:27.480]  handle the blood sugar then you take a couple of dabs take a couple smokes
[09:27.600 --> 09:32.240]  whatever however you bong rips pipe rips get the cannabis India see what it does
[09:32.240 --> 09:37.480]  to you give give each sample that same kind of critical test sample do it in
[09:37.480 --> 09:41.600]  your favorite device in your favorite space have you noticed if you smoke in
[09:41.600 --> 09:45.200]  your little your comfort space you can smoke and enjoy it really comfortably
[09:45.200 --> 09:48.200]  you could taste every terp smell every smell because you don't have to pay
[09:48.200 --> 09:52.640]  attention to like if you're smoking somewhere perhaps in the car or at
[09:52.640 --> 09:56.640]  somebody else's house at somebody else's house maybe the dog is gonna knock over
[09:56.640 --> 10:00.880]  your drink or spill the bong or you can't really focus as much on what you
[10:00.880 --> 10:04.680]  can when you're in your perfect little bubble that's my opinion so I would say
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.560]  smoke all of the samples in a scientific sort of format with the same baseline
[10:09.560 --> 10:14.240]  sort of starting point full stomach no sugar no caffeine clear head good mood
[10:14.240 --> 10:17.920]  nothing to do and see what it does see if that's the one that gives you that
[10:17.920 --> 10:22.520]  giggly euphoric creeper bud feeling you've got to smoke if what you're
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.360]  looking for is specifically that effect you've got to find the finished product
[10:26.360 --> 10:30.120]  that gives you that effect that's the only way to really test it taking early
[10:30.120 --> 10:33.520]  samples won't tell you what you're gonna have in a final product you've got to
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.560]  smoke a final finished product that is my opinion if you really want to know
[10:38.560 --> 10:42.120]  what you're gonna get so you've got a goal you've got a long long term goal a
[10:42.120 --> 10:46.400]  short term goal is to reproduce that giggly effect do you want to F to these
[10:46.400 --> 10:50.400]  things do you want to F 3 F 4 how far do you want to go in your breathing do you
[10:50.400 --> 10:53.440]  just want to make a few seeds for yourself to play with or do you want to
[10:53.440 --> 10:56.320]  make a whole bunch of seeds it sounds like you just want to make some for you
[10:56.320 --> 11:01.080]  to breed and grow out and hopefully you find that giggly stuff so it says any
[11:01.080 --> 11:05.360]  advice would be greatly appreciated keep doing your thing PS I'm about to pop
[11:05.360 --> 11:10.520]  some strawberries starburst I can't wait to see what these are all about cheers
[11:10.520 --> 11:16.000]  from Zack dude strawberry starburst and that bog bubble would be really great
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.680]  and you will find similar bubblegum type turps in the strawberry starburst
[11:21.680 --> 11:24.120]  there's strawberry candy there's strawberry bubblegum there's a
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.520]  watermelon turp in there when you if you grow the flowers out and what I have
[11:29.520 --> 11:33.960]  noticed this is my experience when you grow the flowers and press them into
[11:33.960 --> 11:38.760]  concentrate or what do they want yeah grow the flowers wash it and then press
[11:38.760 --> 11:43.040]  the con the washed concentrates you grow it make bubble hash then press the bubble
[11:43.040 --> 11:47.400]  hash that tasted like strawberry bubblegum that's what I did notice so
[11:47.400 --> 11:53.160]  you may get some strawberry turps bubblegum II turps out of that no do you
[11:53.160 --> 11:58.040]  have an idea when you breed with the bog are you going to use a bubble a bog
[11:58.040 --> 12:02.680]  bubble male or are you gonna use a bog bubble female what do you have in mind
[12:02.680 --> 12:07.120]  here I would grow I would try to use that bog I would almost just make f2s if
[12:07.120 --> 12:10.800]  you're just doing this just for fun for your own personal enjoyment I would make
[12:10.800 --> 12:17.080]  f2s I would find the bog male that looks and smells a lot like the bog female
[12:17.080 --> 12:20.560]  you're going to find find that perfect so you're gonna grow a pack of the bog
[12:20.960 --> 12:23.840]  hopefully you can get more of those seeds right that would be ideal here or
[12:23.840 --> 12:27.040]  hopefully you've got a clone or something of the female anyway try to
[12:27.040 --> 12:31.480]  find some of that bog bubble grow that find a female that gives you the traits
[12:31.480 --> 12:34.400]  you're looking for you're going to find one in there was in the pack the first
[12:34.400 --> 12:38.400]  time that you grew it you'll find it in the pack again so find that phenotype
[12:38.400 --> 12:41.960]  that gives you that giggles the creeper what else was the effect right there
[12:41.960 --> 12:45.360]  that you're looking for giggles creeper there's something else but the my
[12:45.360 --> 12:48.800]  printer kind of messed up or in this euphoric is the other word so find those
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.560]  traits from the female now you've got a male find a male that looks similar to
[12:52.560 --> 12:56.200]  that you're going to be limited on male selection find the best male out of the
[12:56.200 --> 12:59.920]  pack that's going to be up to you find the one that looks a lot like the girl
[12:59.920 --> 13:03.880]  you're working with now you've got a male and you've got a girl now I would
[13:03.880 --> 13:07.880]  also find a couple of other female plants to put in that room something
[13:07.880 --> 13:11.360]  like the strawberry starburst would be cool but then I would find something
[13:11.360 --> 13:17.160]  vastly different than the bog just way different just to play with just to see
[13:17.160 --> 13:22.800]  what that bog is what the bog bubble is contributing to the mix breed it to
[13:22.800 --> 13:27.440]  something really cushy or gassy or garlicky so that you can see what it
[13:27.440 --> 13:30.880]  contributes does it give you it does it change the structure does it change the
[13:30.880 --> 13:34.360]  aroma does it change the does it give you just a bunch of mutants does it make
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.680]  it really resistant to bugs see what that male is adding by breeding it to
[13:38.680 --> 13:42.240]  other plants now of course you've got to grow those but that is the best the
[13:42.240 --> 13:46.160]  funnest part grow maybe I don't know that is a big debate in my head right
[13:46.160 --> 13:49.960]  now I want your feedback send me an email hit me up on Twitter however you
[13:49.960 --> 13:53.240]  know how to get in touch with me on Twitter it's at GF YH podcast I want to
[13:53.240 --> 13:58.640]  know do you enjoy the pheno hunt and growing more or do you enjoy smoking it
[13:58.640 --> 14:02.520]  more I really love growing it and seeing what happens to the flowers like I made
[14:02.520 --> 14:05.960]  the seed so after you make a breeding project this is my question if you do a
[14:05.960 --> 14:10.040]  breeding project and you make seeds are you more excited about seeing what the
[14:10.040 --> 14:14.880]  plants do as they grow or smoking the final product as a breeder I'm torn that
[14:14.920 --> 14:20.080]  is a really that's a really big question for me so I lost my place rambling on
[14:20.080 --> 14:24.480]  that one but I would find that yeah then you get to grow them then you get to
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.280]  smoke them out find a male find a female then find a couple of other females and
[14:28.280 --> 14:31.520]  put them in the room because that dudes gonna be in there skeet skeet and blow
[14:31.520 --> 14:34.720]  them pollen anyway so just put a couple of females in there for him to pollinate
[14:34.720 --> 14:38.160]  make it a party get a bunch of different seeds keep all of those seeds separate
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.200]  when you harvest then grow them out mark them so that you know this is like
[14:42.320 --> 14:46.200]  strawberry starburst to the bog and then this is the whatever to the bog and this
[14:46.200 --> 14:50.320]  to the bog mark them grow them see what you've gotten then like I said identify
[14:50.320 --> 14:55.840]  the trait that that male is delivering to the mix see if he's if the bog f2s
[14:55.840 --> 15:00.040]  come out bubblegum II and euphoric and giggly perfect you hit your goal right
[15:00.040 --> 15:03.360]  there but to the strawberry starburst what did you get did it make the
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.040]  strawberry starburst go super tall did it make it short and squat did it make
[15:07.040 --> 15:12.080]  it get a sour maybe a grapefruit kind of an aroma when you hit it to an indica or
[15:12.080 --> 15:16.280]  a garlic plant does the garlic come out more or does the structure of the
[15:16.280 --> 15:19.960]  original plant you pollinated come out or does the structure of that male plant
[15:19.960 --> 15:24.680]  come out a little bit more you should be able to identify the traits when you do
[15:24.680 --> 15:28.280]  the breeding to see which side which parent came out you should be able to
[15:28.280 --> 15:32.440]  see that so I would take the boy I would take the girl take a few other girls and
[15:32.440 --> 15:37.040]  have a party in there grow them now the most important part again is to finish
[15:37.040 --> 15:40.440]  them let them finish I don't know why I stuttered so strong when I said that but
[15:40.440 --> 15:45.720]  I must have meant it let them finish then harvest them dry them cure them
[15:45.720 --> 15:49.280]  just like you normally do just like you do all of your other crops don't do
[15:49.280 --> 15:52.720]  anything do it scientifically but don't dry them and cure them don't do anything
[15:52.720 --> 15:57.080]  weird no anomalies do what you know don't do any new experiments like I
[15:57.080 --> 16:01.360]  tried this because that may fuck up all of your science if you try one new thing
[16:01.360 --> 16:05.080]  that could mess everything up do the familiar shit that you do but keep it
[16:05.080 --> 16:09.480]  very regulated amongst every plant and the grow dry them cure them smoke them
[16:09.480 --> 16:13.280]  see what you enjoy the best those are your keepers if you are breeding for
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.360]  potency and effect that is the way to find the keepers but also keep in mind
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.960]  that if you're growing this you're going to want plants that grow well structure
[16:22.960 --> 16:26.480]  is important is it shaped well does that plant support itself does it grow in
[16:26.480 --> 16:31.080]  your growing style I don't know if you grow in three guys you're in a three by
[16:31.080 --> 16:34.600]  three tent so you're not in gigantic pots but I don't know if you grow hydro
[16:34.600 --> 16:38.440]  do you grow soilless mix do you grow cocoa do you grow in a six inch net pot
[16:38.440 --> 16:43.520]  or a three gallon pot do you grow one big bud and cut off all the branches do
[16:43.520 --> 16:48.080]  you trellis them out real far do you use a tomato cage do you use a stick are
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.280]  using yo-yos and hanging them from the ceiling yes that is a thing it's not as
[16:51.280 --> 16:55.120]  crazy as it sounds it sounds different than what it looks like if you're not
[16:55.120 --> 16:58.160]  familiar with the yo-yos but how are you growing I don't know how you're growing
[16:58.160 --> 17:02.320]  in there so find the phenotype that is going to work the best for you also your
[17:02.320 --> 17:05.960]  environment is it hot is it cold you may need to find the phenotype that works
[17:06.080 --> 17:09.720]  best for the hot for the cold for the humid for the dry do you want the one
[17:09.720 --> 17:13.320]  that takes a little bit longer to flower are you patient can you handle that are
[17:13.320 --> 17:16.960]  you freaking out are you like yeah this plant needs to get done already are you
[17:16.960 --> 17:20.200]  like man I got all day that's cool let that plant fucking finish I'm patient I
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.080]  love letting plants go for a long time so do you want the faster finisher do
[17:24.080 --> 17:27.760]  you want the longer finisher there's so many variables to think about what about
[17:27.760 --> 17:32.080]  bug resistance do you want these plants to be really resistant to bugs or does
[17:32.080 --> 17:36.400]  that even matter to you do you care if they are resistant to mold and mildew or
[17:36.400 --> 17:40.080]  do you not even care because you're the only one growing those I make seeds for
[17:40.080 --> 17:44.200]  market I make seeds first of all I make a lot of seeds for myself you guys see
[17:44.200 --> 17:47.040]  these strains pop up occasionally you're like where did those come from why were
[17:47.040 --> 17:51.280]  those never for sale like the garlic goat was made just for me to play with
[17:51.280 --> 17:54.560]  and then I made so many of those that I was like I'm never gonna grow all these
[17:54.560 --> 17:58.280]  so I put some of them out let some people get their hands on those but if
[17:58.280 --> 18:01.760]  you're just making them for you you could breed for just potency just for
[18:01.760 --> 18:04.960]  flavor I'm breeding for things that go to the market they've got to be pest
[18:04.960 --> 18:09.880]  resistant pathogen resistant definitely no mutants no intersex plants I've got
[18:09.880 --> 18:13.480]  to be very careful what I put out but when I'm making stuff for me I could
[18:13.480 --> 18:17.160]  just be it could be really problematic and I can find the keeper for myself to
[18:17.160 --> 18:20.080]  grow and that's more fun so it depends on what you're gonna do with it it
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.320]  sounds like these are just for you now you've got that three by three you don't
[18:24.320 --> 18:28.280]  have to grow gigantic plants if you find this is something I was talking about
[18:28.280 --> 18:31.480]  with a couple of friends people like I just don't have room to breed I don't
[18:31.480 --> 18:35.240]  have the space I wish I had room to grow and breed you can breed in a very
[18:35.240 --> 18:39.280]  small space your three by three would be beautiful I keep saying put that male
[18:39.280 --> 18:43.760]  plant and several females in there you can pollinate in a three by three you
[18:43.760 --> 18:48.040]  could probably hypothetically put you guy can fit nine three gallon pots in
[18:48.040 --> 18:51.360]  there easily in a three by three they may be the pots may be touching might
[18:51.360 --> 18:55.840]  not be a lot of space but I'm thinking nine three rows of three three gallon
[18:55.840 --> 18:58.960]  pots put the dude in the middle surround him with ladies when he starts
[18:58.960 --> 19:03.000]  pollinating all those girls are gonna get it that's probably what I would do
[19:03.000 --> 19:07.080]  that's a eight female plants in there that you get to pollinate you know you
[19:07.080 --> 19:11.000]  don't have to grow them very big if you want to go even quicker and not make a
[19:11.000 --> 19:15.640]  big mess and get a bunch of pollen and have a huge project you can breed in
[19:15.640 --> 19:19.920]  small pots I've done beer cup breeding projects I shouldn't tell everybody
[19:19.920 --> 19:23.640]  about this as a seed maker I shouldn't tell you how to make seeds so quickly so
[19:23.640 --> 19:27.680]  easily but this is a very easy effective way to make a few seeds just for
[19:27.680 --> 19:32.160]  yourself to play with when I make seeds the first time I make a cross let's say
[19:32.160 --> 19:36.480]  that we're gonna make let's pick a strain let's say Jack Tripper this is a
[19:36.480 --> 19:41.280]  real thing that has happened to Jack Tripper Jack Tripper is lemon skunk to
[19:41.280 --> 19:45.120]  Jack the Ripper come and dance on our floor the song will be stuck in your
[19:45.120 --> 19:48.560]  head all day you're gonna be coming knock on our door now it's in your head
[19:48.560 --> 19:51.680]  it'll never stop that's where Jack Tripper came from on the story when the
[19:51.680 --> 19:55.760]  question gets asked Jack Tripper lemon skunk Jack the Ripper call it Jack
[19:55.880 --> 20:02.560]  amazing lemon turps lemon cleaner turps almost gross overpowering lemon
[20:02.560 --> 20:06.040]  cleaner turps and the head buzz it's like a knife just came through the
[20:06.040 --> 20:09.280]  ceiling and ripped your head off and opened your brain in half and lights and
[20:09.280 --> 20:12.600]  fireworks just come out of your brain for a minute the head high is so
[20:12.600 --> 20:19.200]  extreme but anyway let me focus Jack Tripper I only made 70 50 something
[20:19.200 --> 20:24.280]  seeds of that maybe just a small a small drug bag of seeds that's how many seeds
[20:24.280 --> 20:27.360]  I made you know what I'm talking about a little drug bag that's how many seeds
[20:27.360 --> 20:32.800]  I made not a lot because I don't know I didn't know I do know now at the time I
[20:32.800 --> 20:37.080]  didn't know if that was gonna be completely intersex plants complete
[20:37.080 --> 20:40.880]  mutants I didn't know if they were gonna take 74 weeks to flower I didn't know if
[20:40.880 --> 20:44.000]  they were gonna be duds I didn't know what it was gonna do so instead of
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.960]  wasting time vegging a plant that is gonna get real big first of all a male
[20:50.040 --> 20:54.480]  plant that gets real big makes a lot of pollen pollen goes everywhere and not
[20:54.480 --> 20:57.800]  that I'm lazy but I don't want to clean up a whole bunch of pollen if I don't
[20:57.800 --> 21:01.880]  have to if there's minimal pollen that is less to clean so I grew a smaller
[21:01.880 --> 21:05.880]  male plant he was in a six inch net box I wanted him kind of bigger than the
[21:05.880 --> 21:09.160]  females because I want enough pollen to get the room there so I got my male in a
[21:09.160 --> 21:13.040]  six inch net pot I got my females and beer cups I can pollinate a bunch of
[21:13.040 --> 21:16.920]  beer cups you grow them to where they're just big enough to I don't know four or
[21:16.920 --> 21:20.520]  five inches maybe three and a half inches flip them by the time the pollen
[21:20.520 --> 21:24.120]  hits they're only maybe eight inches ten inches tall by the time they're done
[21:24.120 --> 21:27.480]  they're ten or they're twelve maybe fourteen inches tall you may need to put
[21:27.480 --> 21:30.440]  a skinny stick in there just to support them but from that plant you're gonna
[21:30.440 --> 21:36.200]  get a lot of seeds a lot a lot of seeds a lot like 30 to 70 seeds probably and
[21:36.200 --> 21:40.320]  that's plenty for just a home grower a home breeder to tinker and play with you
[21:40.320 --> 21:43.960]  guys buy a ten pack and you spend good money on a ten pack if you get 30 seeds
[21:43.960 --> 21:47.720]  and you do that to four or five plants you're gonna get at least a hundred
[21:47.720 --> 21:50.680]  hundred and fifty two hundred and something seeds to play with and you
[21:50.680 --> 21:54.920]  can do that in one very small run if you've got a small just a very tiny
[21:54.920 --> 22:00.240]  space that you can control the light to 1212 for six weeks nine weeks on there
[22:00.240 --> 22:03.360]  are some variables and there I said six weeks because you can put the light back
[22:03.360 --> 22:07.120]  to a vegetative cycle and the seeds will finish you don't have any problem with
[22:07.120 --> 22:12.120]  that but six to nine weeks that you can control a flowering cycle three or four
[22:12.120 --> 22:15.000]  two or three three or four weeks you can control a veg phase you can produce
[22:15.000 --> 22:19.720]  seeds that will be very viable usable for yourself so I got rambly on that one
[22:19.720 --> 22:23.240]  but you don't need as much space as you think you might need is what I'm saying
[22:23.240 --> 22:27.560]  you can pollinate little tiny plants they don't have to be super large get
[22:27.560 --> 22:31.480]  them in a beer cup veg them until they're as tall as GI Joe flower them
[22:31.480 --> 22:35.760]  they'll end up two or three GI Joe's tall they'll have 30 50 maybe even a
[22:35.760 --> 22:39.080]  hundred seeds in there depending on the strain some of the OG kush stuff doesn't
[22:39.080 --> 22:42.600]  make a lot of big buds you don't get a lot of seeds out of that the Mac doesn't
[22:42.600 --> 22:47.360]  take pollen the Mac is just stingy don't be stingy Mac but then things like
[22:47.360 --> 22:50.480]  strawberry starburst they'll take a lot of pollen and give you a lot of seeds
[22:50.480 --> 22:54.720]  blue raspberry truffle blueberry cookies they make a lot of pistols they
[22:54.720 --> 22:58.880]  make a lot of seeds when you pollinate them the jack the Ripper crosses make a
[22:58.880 --> 23:03.680]  lot of pistols very early and produce a lot of seeds so you can hit those really
[23:03.680 --> 23:06.840]  early when they're little and produce seeds for yourself to play with all right
[23:06.840 --> 23:10.760]  I got rambling let me check my notes there are more notes on this page if
[23:10.760 --> 23:14.680]  you're looking for the effects you definitely have to smoke it got to find
[23:14.680 --> 23:18.400]  the the potency that you're looking for there's no other way to tell now here is
[23:18.400 --> 23:22.640]  the last note that I did right on this page it says if you find the right
[23:22.640 --> 23:25.880]  keeper and the one that gives you that giggly buzz and that euphoric high and
[23:25.880 --> 23:30.560]  that creeper effect that you're looking for is it necessary to do any breeding
[23:30.560 --> 23:34.200]  you've already got the plant that you're looking for it's perfect you could you
[23:34.200 --> 23:37.880]  could just be happy with that I understand the desire the need the want
[23:37.880 --> 23:42.360]  just the excitement of breeding but honestly if you've got the plant that
[23:42.360 --> 23:46.160]  does what you need it to do you don't you don't really have to go any further
[23:46.160 --> 23:49.800]  you could just clone it and grow it forever and ever and be completely happy
[23:49.800 --> 23:54.200]  with that you could or you can s1 it you could self it and make more seeds of it
[23:54.200 --> 23:59.400]  then you've got those seeds forever here's another Avenue if you don't have
[23:59.400 --> 24:03.880]  a male plant if you don't have any seeds if you do of the bog if you do have the
[24:03.880 --> 24:08.440]  clone of the bog you can reverse it and you can use that as your pollen donor
[24:08.440 --> 24:12.760]  and that can pollinate another clone of the bog you can make s ones of that and
[24:12.760 --> 24:17.120]  while you're doing that you can also put that pollen on other female plants and
[24:17.120 --> 24:21.280]  out cross it those would be ours from the previous episode self and reverse
[24:21.280 --> 24:25.920]  plants you can make some selves and some reversals using the bog keeper I don't
[24:25.920 --> 24:30.120]  know if you still have it let me try to read again always wanted to breed years
[24:30.120 --> 24:33.880]  ago but he grew for the first time got our hands on bog since then I've looked
[24:33.880 --> 24:37.360]  I've loved all things well so I don't know if you still have it if you've
[24:37.360 --> 24:41.400]  still got it you can self it and then you can make self cross of it and you
[24:41.400 --> 24:45.440]  can out cross it if you still have it if not I would recommend trying to find
[24:45.440 --> 24:48.600]  another pack if not you said you're growing the strawberry starburst you're
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.640]  gonna find similar bubblegum Eterps in there you'll find creeper you'll find
[24:52.640 --> 24:58.520]  euphoric the answer may lie in that pack all right my friend Zach I do want to
[24:58.520 --> 25:01.520]  thank you for the great message you did get me rambling I do appreciate that I
[25:01.520 --> 25:04.680]  like talking about breeding I like looping it back to previous episodes
[25:04.680 --> 25:09.160]  that was a good chat thank you once again the email address is grow from
[25:09.160 --> 25:13.720]  your heart at hotmail.com don't be shy send me those questions I do have one
[25:13.720 --> 25:17.040]  more quick question I'm going to cover here in this episode this one comes from
[25:17.040 --> 25:22.080]  our friend Kyle what up Kyle thank you for the great question this one goes a
[25:22.080 --> 25:27.360]  lot like this it says hey Rasta Jeff I have a question about pH this is a good
[25:27.360 --> 25:33.400]  question it says I know you recommend to be in the 6.2 to 6.5 range I usually
[25:33.400 --> 25:38.600]  would say 6.2 to 6.4 but 6.5 in like a soilless mix and stuff yeah that'll work
[25:38.600 --> 25:43.600]  for you this is I completely understand the reasoning but I'm curious why canna
[25:43.600 --> 25:47.160]  recommend canna is a nutrient brand by the way it says I'm curious why canna
[25:47.160 --> 25:53.320]  recommends as low as 5.5 so canna is a nutrient company they sell bottled
[25:53.320 --> 25:57.200]  nutrients and on their website most of the nutrient brands that you buy do have
[25:57.200 --> 26:01.880]  a website with a nutrient calculator a nutrient feed chart on there a nutrient
[26:01.880 --> 26:06.520]  nutrient schedule nutrients is starting to become the new row ads in my head if
[26:06.520 --> 26:12.160]  you know what I'm talking about big up shout out to Chris Farley nutrients
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.320]  anyway so they're a nutrient company they sell bottled nutrients and they do
[26:16.320 --> 26:21.200]  recommend as low as 5.5 that does make sense I did check their website let's
[26:21.200 --> 26:26.440]  talk minimally about pH because I am not an organic chemistry expert our plants
[26:26.440 --> 26:30.480]  are uptaking buffered nutrients in a bottled nutrient environment they're
[26:30.480 --> 26:34.600]  taking up bottled nutrients they're taking up the 16 elements nitrogen
[26:34.600 --> 26:40.120]  phosphorus potassium molybdenum while you say that one fast calcium
[26:40.120 --> 26:43.080]  magnesium there are more that I'm gonna miss but I'm gonna try to keep on moving
[26:43.080 --> 26:47.000]  our plants are trying to uptake those things for those things to be bio
[26:47.000 --> 26:53.480]  available to our plant the pH needs to be the pH of that feed solution needs to
[26:53.480 --> 27:01.000]  be around 6.2 to 6.5 those nutrients are more bio available to the plant at that
[27:01.000 --> 27:04.440]  range once it gets higher the plant doesn't uptake that once it gets lower
[27:04.440 --> 27:09.480]  the plant doesn't uptake that the reason we recommend a 6.2 to 6.5 is because
[27:09.480 --> 27:13.080]  there's kind of a range where like some of the nutrients would kind of take up
[27:13.080 --> 27:17.400]  better at 6.5 some of them would kind of take up better at 6.2 so we go right in
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.720]  the middle to where you get just just kind of the best for both of those
[27:20.720 --> 27:25.160]  nutrients were using so many things we just found that within that 6.2 to 6.4
[27:25.160 --> 27:31.720]  6.5 range you do get a good window where most things will absorb with the work
[27:31.720 --> 27:34.320]  best together I don't know the scientific terms like I said I'm not an
[27:34.320 --> 27:39.040]  organic chemistry major but that's where things seem to work the best now the
[27:39.040 --> 27:45.280]  reason that they are giving you such a broad range in this proprietary brand I
[27:45.280 --> 27:50.400]  did yet and the rest of the question says recommends 5.5 I do believe they
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.880]  say the highest is 6.2 is this something proprietary to them yes this
[27:54.880 --> 28:00.160]  is proprietary to them I did some research on their website the 5.2 is
[28:00.160 --> 28:07.640]  recommended for hydro for dirt they recommend a 5.8 to 6.2 and for cocoa they
[28:07.640 --> 28:14.400]  recommend 5.5 to 6.2 so in the hydro there's nothing buffering those
[28:14.400 --> 28:18.440]  nutrients from touching the roots so they give you just a little bit lower
[28:18.440 --> 28:22.280]  pH that's just straight to the nutrients straight absorption absorption
[28:22.280 --> 28:26.400]  so the lower pH works there's no soil to buffer there there's nothing to work
[28:26.400 --> 28:29.840]  through nothing in the way straight to the roots that makes sense they'll be
[28:29.840 --> 28:34.760]  quickly absorbable at that low of a pH I per honestly I'm not super experienced
[28:34.760 --> 28:39.720]  in hydro but it does kind of make sense for the little bit I know about plant
[28:39.720 --> 28:44.800]  growing organic chemistry and pH I do think that makes sense now a 5.8 6.2 in
[28:44.800 --> 28:49.080]  the dirt is because of the buffering of the dirt the soil the dirt there does
[28:49.080 --> 28:53.080]  give you a little bit to work with it does make that range a little bit more
[28:53.080 --> 28:56.680]  available for the plants it's kind of I keep saying the word buffering you just
[28:56.680 --> 29:00.800]  get a little more room to work with that's why that's why we recommend soil
[29:00.800 --> 29:04.120]  and soilless mix to new growers because it is a little bit easier to work with
[29:04.120 --> 29:08.800]  that soil kind of works the soil kind of corrects your problems a little bit to
[29:08.800 --> 29:12.040]  an extent don't think you can just go pouring in a bunch of shit but it does
[29:12.040 --> 29:16.240]  kind of help you correct the problems at that point you fed the soil the soil
[29:16.240 --> 29:20.080]  will do some work the live living shit inside the soil will do its things and
[29:20.080 --> 29:23.400]  help correct what you've done a little bit and make that available to the
[29:23.400 --> 29:27.480]  plants again I'm gonna get a lot of messages about what I just said I am NOT
[29:27.480 --> 29:30.760]  an organic chemistry major I'm trying to explain this the best I know how
[29:30.760 --> 29:34.840]  somebody said I explained things like people have never grown before good a
[29:34.840 --> 29:38.600]  lot of people never have grown before and that's why they're here let me keep
[29:38.600 --> 29:45.080]  going then it says 5.5 to 6.2 in cocoa yeah we're getting that low 5.5 in cocoa
[29:45.080 --> 29:50.080]  because that is very close to hydro that is kind of a hybrid of soilless mix
[29:50.080 --> 29:54.760]  hydro together so that's why you can go so low in there basically nothing
[29:54.760 --> 29:58.920]  buffering protecting the roots just cocoa in there that's basically hydro
[29:58.920 --> 30:04.880]  the cocoa is basically inert also we could talk about I wrote down phase and
[30:05.040 --> 30:09.240]  medium and plant specific in certain phases your plants are gonna want
[30:09.240 --> 30:15.360]  different pH is in different medium your plant may want different pH is and also
[30:15.360 --> 30:20.080]  it's plant specific I know that some of the cookies crosses like a lower pH some
[30:20.080 --> 30:25.000]  of the more sativa dominant stuff likes a higher pH sometimes if you're in
[30:25.000 --> 30:28.360]  certain environments you want to adjust pH to kind of compensate for some things
[30:28.360 --> 30:33.000]  that may help you out so that is why they're recommending a range let me get
[30:33.120 --> 30:36.800]  back onto the question get back in track here it's alright it goes on to say this
[30:36.800 --> 30:41.080]  run I followed your range and I feel like my plants are very happy I have
[30:41.080 --> 30:45.520]  your testers hitting my flower tent next and I wanted to get your thoughts I'm
[30:45.520 --> 30:48.000]  excited to see your testers it sounds like you're gonna pay a lot of good
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.040]  attention to them it says as a side note for this typically when I mix my
[30:53.040 --> 30:58.120]  nutrients it hits about 6.3 until I bump up the feed and mid flower then it
[30:58.120 --> 31:03.240]  consistently sits at 5.8 until I adjust that's gonna you could probably feed
[31:03.240 --> 31:07.240]  them that 5.8 and they wouldn't be angry but if you're liking what you're seeing
[31:07.240 --> 31:11.040]  I wouldn't change anything a lot of people want to make changes because of
[31:11.040 --> 31:14.600]  numbers and shit watch the plants the plants are the boss if you're liking the
[31:14.600 --> 31:18.760]  results don't change anything it goes on to say thanks for all you do you've
[31:18.760 --> 31:23.320]  helped me improve my grow by leaps and bounds I can't thank you enough your
[31:23.320 --> 31:26.320]  friend Kyle that means a lot to me knowing that I have improved your grow
[31:26.320 --> 31:30.560]  leaps and bounds that makes it all worth it like I said those kind of
[31:30.560 --> 31:34.680]  compliments that type of feedback make setting up a camera makes having a
[31:34.680 --> 31:37.440]  frustrating camera that keeps turning off on me and draining a battery and
[31:37.440 --> 31:41.200]  doing weird shit these comments this type of feedback makes all that shit
[31:41.200 --> 31:44.520]  worth it sometimes that camera makes me want to throw it I'm not even mad at
[31:44.520 --> 31:47.720]  that camera anymore doesn't even bug me that I got these bright ass lights in my
[31:47.720 --> 31:51.480]  face I love the feedback thank you guys I love knowing that I'm making your
[31:51.480 --> 31:54.640]  garden better I love knowing that I'm making your growing experience better
[31:54.640 --> 31:58.960]  growing should be fun growing should be pleasurable growing is like my Zen zone
[31:58.960 --> 32:03.080]  I do work in a commercial environment I do consulting I do get paid for that
[32:03.080 --> 32:07.600]  sort of stuff when I'm in my own personal grow I close the door I put in
[32:07.600 --> 32:10.720]  the earbuds sometimes I'm just listening to the grow sometimes I just hear the
[32:10.720 --> 32:15.360]  fans and the blowers and I love it it's relaxing the the sound of a vortex fan
[32:15.360 --> 32:21.000]  or a hurricane fan and then just another oscillating fan coming by that
[32:21.000 --> 32:27.720]  and then those sounds it's like oh what is it ASMR AMSR I don't know the right
[32:27.720 --> 32:31.680]  order but it's like music to my ears sometimes hearing those fucking sounds
[32:31.680 --> 32:40.240]  in the grow space and then you hear the air conditioner kick on that that's a
[32:40.240 --> 32:43.200]  pretty good imitation of the air conditioner that'll run for a few
[32:43.200 --> 32:46.400]  minutes and then it cycles off I just love being in there and hearing all the
[32:46.400 --> 32:50.160]  rhythms of the shit knowing it's all working smooth and smelling the plants I
[32:50.280 --> 32:53.440]  just like being in there that's my Zen space you can't fuck with me when I'm in
[32:53.440 --> 32:56.640]  there I leave the phone outside it's in that's on the charger somewhere else
[32:56.640 --> 33:00.880]  yeah let's go in the grow that is my Zen space so knowing that I can make your
[33:00.880 --> 33:04.640]  grow that comfortable for you it's your getaway like mine is I don't need a
[33:04.640 --> 33:09.200]  vacation my vacation is in the grow it's cool let's go do some defoliating
[33:09.200 --> 33:12.840]  let's go do some cloning some topping popping lollipopping twisting let's just
[33:12.840 --> 33:17.040]  go stare at the plants that's like my meditation right there anyway I'm glad
[33:17.040 --> 33:20.640]  I'm making your grow as enjoyable as mine ladies and gentlemen boys girls
[33:20.640 --> 33:26.040]  pimps hoes friends foes newbies and pros smokers and growers clone cutters and
[33:26.040 --> 33:29.680]  pollen chuckers all of you beautiful cannabis enthusiasts out there thank you
[33:29.680 --> 33:32.640]  once again for listening to me ramble on another episode of the grow from your
[33:32.640 --> 33:35.800]  heart podcast thanks for hanging out I really did have a good time on this
[33:35.800 --> 33:39.440]  episode even though I only had one camera to ramble into I will get camera
[33:39.440 --> 33:42.840]  number two repaired we'll figure out what's going on with that maybe like I
[33:42.840 --> 33:46.160]  said before I'll buy camera three that way we've got a backup plan the camera
[33:46.160 --> 33:49.640]  two decides to be a little bitch again thanks for hanging out you guys if you
[33:49.640 --> 33:52.240]  have any questions corrections comments or concerns you know I would love to
[33:52.240 --> 33:56.280]  hear from you the email address again is grow from your heart at hotmail.com make
[33:56.280 --> 34:00.120]  sure you hit the patreon campaign at patreon.com forward slash grow from your
[34:00.120 --> 34:06.120]  heart everything else is on the website at I read genetics.com I think that's
[34:06.120 --> 34:09.880]  all I've got for you for this episode let's wrap it up while it was nice and
[34:09.880 --> 34:13.520]  tight I want to give a big shout out to my buddy levity love day and until next
[34:13.520 --> 34:18.560]  time take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me
