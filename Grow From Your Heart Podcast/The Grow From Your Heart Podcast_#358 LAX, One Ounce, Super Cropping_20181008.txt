[00:00.000 --> 00:05.360]  Welcome to the show everybody. It's time for episode 358 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.360 --> 00:10.140]  Thank you for joining me. This episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:10.140 --> 00:14.600]  If you need new genetics for your garden, I highly recommend the Hella Dank Seed Company,
[00:14.600 --> 00:19.000]  and you can find them at dankseed.store.
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.660]  I like to start the show by letting you know what I am smoking on. Today, I'm taking dabs
[00:23.660 --> 00:31.400]  of Lemon Tea Pucker No. 1 Live Resin Batter from 710 Labs. This stuff smells very familiar.
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.380]  At the last Dude Grows Cup, Moby Dill gave me a bud that I'm pretty sure he said was
[00:36.380 --> 00:42.100]  lemon pucker. I think he told me the cross on that was jilly bean and lemon gee. That
[00:42.100 --> 00:47.140]  would make great sense because this concentrate certainly has lemon gee in it. It's got that
[00:47.140 --> 00:52.940]  greasy funky lemon citrusy terp to it. Then at the end, it's got that sweet white grapes
[00:52.940 --> 00:57.420]  going on, which I really think comes from the jilly bean. I think the cross on this
[00:57.420 --> 01:02.940]  is lemon gee and jilly bean, but I can't be certain. One thing I'm certain of is it tastes
[01:02.940 --> 01:09.180]  amazing and it has got me super high and super rambly. This should be a great podcast.
[01:09.180 --> 01:13.100]  You guys, I've been working my way through a long series of grow lessons. Just a heads
[01:13.100 --> 01:16.460]  up at the beginning here, I'm going to take a break from the lessons on this episode,
[01:16.460 --> 01:21.100]  but I'll get right back into the grow talk on the next episode. On this episode, we're
[01:21.100 --> 01:25.460]  going to read some emails. We're going to give some shout outs, but first let's start
[01:25.460 --> 01:31.860]  with a little update from LAX. What? That's right. LA International Airport put out a
[01:31.860 --> 01:36.980]  press release recently and we'll just jump right into it. This is what it says.
[01:36.980 --> 01:43.140]  LAX marijuana policy. While federal law prohibits the possession of marijuana inclusive of federal
[01:43.140 --> 01:50.480]  airspace, California's passage of proposition 64, effective January 1st, 2018, allows for
[01:50.520 --> 01:57.680]  individuals 21 years of age or older to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana and 8 grams
[01:57.680 --> 02:04.220]  of concentrated marijuana for personal consumption. In accordance with Prop 64, the Los Angeles
[02:04.220 --> 02:11.140]  Airport Police Department will allow passengers to travel through LAX with up to 28.5 grams
[02:11.140 --> 02:18.320]  of marijuana and 8 grams of concentrated marijuana. However, passengers should be aware that marijuana
[02:18.320 --> 02:24.200]  laws vary state by state and they are encouraged to check with the laws of the states in which
[02:24.200 --> 02:30.260]  they plan to travel. So LAX, the Los Angeles International Airport, has released their
[02:30.260 --> 02:37.080]  official cannabis policy. They will let you leave with 28.5 grams of cannabis and 8 grams
[02:37.080 --> 02:41.720]  of concentrates. The statement did not include anything about what they would do if you tried
[02:41.720 --> 02:46.000]  to travel with more, so just don't do that. Wherever you're going, an ounce should be
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.400]  enough. An ounce and 8 grams of concentrates should be plenty for a short trip anyway.
[02:51.400 --> 02:55.840]  The second half of their statement was a reminder that it is your responsibility to understand
[02:55.840 --> 03:00.600]  the legality of cannabis in your destination. Wherever you are landing, you need to know
[03:00.600 --> 03:06.560]  the rules and laws regarding medical and or recreational cannabis in that state. Some
[03:06.560 --> 03:12.040]  states have a reciprocal medical marijuana program. If you are a medical marijuana patient
[03:12.040 --> 03:16.160]  in one state and you fly to these states that allow out-of-state medical marijuana
[03:16.160 --> 03:21.160]  patients to have access to medical marijuana there, you should be just fine. If you are
[03:21.160 --> 03:25.560]  flying to a state that does not allow cannabis, just be careful. You are probably going to
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.080]  pick up your luggage and leave the airport. Now you are just in civilization with cannabis
[03:30.080 --> 03:34.880]  in a prohibition state, act accordingly. Now here's something to think about. Perhaps you've
[03:34.880 --> 03:39.360]  got to transfer planes. Perhaps you're like our friend White Mike, who as soon as he gets
[03:39.360 --> 03:44.240]  off the plane, the first thing he's thinking about is getting a cigarette into his lungs.
[03:44.240 --> 03:48.640]  Don't run out of the airport, go smoke a cigarette, and then have to go back through security
[03:48.640 --> 03:53.220]  in Dallas, Texas, where they're not going to be cannabis friendly. Keep stuff like that
[03:53.220 --> 03:58.640]  in mind if you were traveling with your products. LAX didn't care that you had an ounce of herb
[03:58.640 --> 04:03.400]  and 8 grams of concentrates, but when you make that transfer in Kansas City or in Chicago,
[04:03.400 --> 04:07.660]  are they going to be okay with that stuff you've got in your backpack? Plan ahead and
[04:07.660 --> 04:10.420]  pay attention and you should be okay.
[04:10.420 --> 04:14.500]  I was talking to a comedian friend of mine who travels with cannabis quite frequently,
[04:14.500 --> 04:18.740]  and I was asking him how he feels so comfortable just putting his weed and his carry on and
[04:18.740 --> 04:24.420]  flying across the country. And he said, dude, the TSA does not care. The TSA told him specifically
[04:24.420 --> 04:28.600]  they're not looking for cannabis. Cannabis doesn't hurt anybody on a plane. Weapons and
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.820]  bombs hurt people on planes, so they don't care about cannabis at all. So most of the
[04:32.820 --> 04:37.740]  time they don't give a shit. Of course, there are those TSA agents that want to be heroes.
[04:37.740 --> 04:40.980]  If they find a little something on you, they want to call the police, they want to call
[04:40.980 --> 04:45.320]  airport security. So always be prepared for dipshits in the world like that. But for the
[04:45.320 --> 04:50.260]  most part, the TSA does not care about your ganja in your bag.
[04:50.260 --> 04:54.140]  So that was a statement from the Los Angeles International Airport. I like that they've
[04:54.140 --> 04:58.820]  made it clear not only for travelers, but also for airport security. Now you have less
[04:58.820 --> 05:05.100]  opportunity for rogue TSA agents to try to cause you a problem with your cannabis in
[05:05.100 --> 05:10.100]  Los Angeles. This is a completely different approach than what they did in Denver. At
[05:10.100 --> 05:14.900]  the Denver International Airport, they set up what are called amnesty boxes. They're
[05:14.900 --> 05:19.500]  basically trash cans with a sign on it that reminds you that it's illegal to leave the
[05:19.500 --> 05:25.660]  state with your cannabis. They expect people with leftover product to just drop their cannabis
[05:25.660 --> 05:29.900]  in these little trash cans, and then you can travel safely with nothing to worry about.
[05:29.900 --> 05:36.620]  The last time anybody spoke about these amnesty boxes, nobody has ever put anything in them.
[05:36.620 --> 05:39.820]  We've got a friend who travels through the Denver International Airport on a regular
[05:39.820 --> 05:44.660]  basis, and she takes her medicine with her, and they've never given her any trouble. So
[05:44.660 --> 05:49.820]  it seems like as long as you are not traveling with weapons or explosives, the TSA at the
[05:49.820 --> 05:55.340]  Denver International Airport is not concerned with cannabis possession. However, again,
[05:56.020 --> 06:01.980]  legalities of cannabis in your destination. Also, I am not a lawyer. I don't claim to be
[06:01.980 --> 06:07.100]  one, and I don't play one on TV. So never take legal advice from a guy who calls himself Rasta
[06:07.100 --> 06:11.380]  Jeff. Here are a couple of more things to think about while I'm on the subject. Do not try to
[06:11.380 --> 06:15.820]  travel with your torch. They will take your torch from you. The torch is unacceptable to go on the
[06:15.820 --> 06:20.340]  plane. That can explode. It can also be used as a weapon. They won't let you take your torch.
[06:20.460 --> 06:24.220]  Be very selective about your dabber. If you've got a Happy Daddy dabber,
[06:24.220 --> 06:28.380]  Happy Daddy makes the dabbers that look like knives. That's a fucking knife on the plane.
[06:28.380 --> 06:32.460]  They will not let you take that. They will confiscate that from you. Another thing,
[06:32.460 --> 06:37.180]  if you're going to travel with medicine and you are okay, if you feel safe with your medicine
[06:37.180 --> 06:42.460]  in your destination, take it in your carry-on. You are much more likely to get your medical
[06:42.460 --> 06:48.420]  marijuana stolen from you by TSA if it is packed in your suitcase and going under the plane. When
[06:48.420 --> 06:51.660]  they inspect that stuff, they'll steal it. They're not looking at you. No one's looking
[06:51.660 --> 06:55.540]  at them. There's no eye contact. They're just taking shit out of a bag. That's really easy
[06:55.540 --> 07:00.660]  for a person to do without any sort of guilty conscience or second thought. So keep it on you
[07:00.660 --> 07:04.500]  if that's an option. Have it in your carry-on. Have it in your pocket. Like I said, if you're
[07:04.500 --> 07:08.980]  going through LAX, they don't care. I'm not a lawyer. Denver doesn't seem to care. That's kind
[07:08.980 --> 07:14.860]  of a case-by-case basis. If you do plan to travel with product, stay under the limit. In LAX,
[07:14.980 --> 07:19.860]  it's 28.5 grams, which is more than an ounce. We're going to talk about that in just a second.
[07:19.860 --> 07:24.540]  Also, you get eight grams. That's plenty of cannabis to travel with. Then in Colorado,
[07:24.540 --> 07:29.260]  they haven't spoken about the rules. If you've got personal medicine, they don't seem to care.
[07:29.260 --> 07:34.420]  So the first thing is stay under your limit. The second thing is don't take a torch. A torch is
[07:34.420 --> 07:39.460]  intimidating. That makes fire. Also, when you fly with that, it goes up in the air. That could
[07:39.460 --> 07:43.420]  explode. That's kind of sketchy. Don't take a torch with you. That will cause you issues.
[07:43.820 --> 07:48.860]  The other thing to think about is your dabber. Is your dabber going to be misconstrued as a weapon?
[07:48.860 --> 07:54.380]  Could it be used as a weapon? It doesn't have to look like a weapon or maybe be intimidating,
[07:54.380 --> 07:59.340]  but could you use it as a weapon? It can be considered a weapon if you can use it as one.
[07:59.340 --> 08:04.180]  So think about that when you're packing your dabber. If you've got a rig and a nail with you,
[08:04.180 --> 08:08.540]  the TSA is going to want to open up your case. They're going to want to open up your Pelican
[08:08.540 --> 08:12.100]  case and take the glass out. They're going to want to make sure there's nothing else in there.
[08:12.100 --> 08:17.380]  They'll probably run your case through the x-ray machine or the scanning device of their choice.
[08:18.180 --> 08:23.460]  If you've got an expensive rig, make them aware of the value of that rig before you open the case.
[08:23.460 --> 08:27.460]  These are people. You can communicate with them. Talk to them like an adult. They're going to say,
[08:27.460 --> 08:32.340]  what's in the case? And you just say, it's glass. Would you like to see it? It's functional glass
[08:32.340 --> 08:37.300]  art. Would you like to see? They're going to say, yes. Say, this is worth this much money.
[08:37.300 --> 08:42.340]  This is a $10,000 piece of functional glass art. Before you touch this, I need you to know that,
[08:42.340 --> 08:46.420]  but there's nothing wrong with you inspecting my case. And they can look at it. And if you've got
[08:46.420 --> 08:50.260]  accessories in the case, make sure you make everything safe for them. So that's my simple
[08:50.260 --> 08:56.500]  advice for if you do choose to travel with a rig, don't take a torch, don't take a dangerous dabber,
[08:56.500 --> 09:01.940]  and don't take too much product. Other than that, you should be just fine based on your destination.
[09:01.940 --> 09:07.620]  And again, I'm not a lawyer. Don't take legal advice from a dude who calls himself Rasta Jeff.
[09:08.180 --> 09:12.660]  All right, you guys, that is my report on the official statement from LAX. Before we move on,
[09:12.660 --> 09:16.980]  I owe a few people some shout outs. I want to give a huge shout out to Miles Porter. I want
[09:16.980 --> 09:21.940]  to give a shout out to Todd Keller, a big fist bump, and a shout out to Steve F, and a giant
[09:21.940 --> 09:27.060]  birthday hug, and a shout out to Miss Melanie. Thanks for all the support, you guys. I truly
[09:27.060 --> 09:34.420]  appreciate it. Now, in the last segment, I mentioned that 28.5 grams is more than one ounce.
[09:34.420 --> 09:39.620]  It has recently been brought to my attention that a lot of people are confused about the actual
[09:39.620 --> 09:45.060]  weight of one ounce. Now, let's play a game. I'm going to ask you guys the weight of one ounce,
[09:45.060 --> 09:48.500]  and I want you to answer out loud. So if there are multiple people in the room,
[09:48.500 --> 09:55.140]  everybody can hear your answer. Now, here's my question. How many grams are in one ounce?
[09:57.620 --> 10:06.420]  Now, everybody that just said 28 grams, you've been ripping people off. There are 28.3495 grams
[10:06.420 --> 10:11.940]  in an ounce. If you round that up, it is 28.35 grams for an ounce. Now, I know you're saying
[10:11.940 --> 10:18.260]  0.35 grams, not a big deal. Well, let's do 0.35 grams on the calculator. We start off with one
[10:18.260 --> 10:25.060]  ounce. If we do, let's start like this. Let's do 28 grams times four, a quarter pound, right?
[10:25.060 --> 10:35.060]  28 times four is 112. 28.35 times four comes out to 113.4. Now, that's not that much of a
[10:35.060 --> 10:42.500]  difference, but in today's market, every gram and every dollar should count. So start thinking
[10:42.500 --> 10:51.620]  about that 0.35. Let's do it on a larger scale. 0.35 times 16 ounces, that's 5.6 grams. You're
[10:51.620 --> 10:58.500]  shorting a pound. If you're weighing 28 gram ounces, your pound will be 5.6 grams short.
[10:58.500 --> 11:03.860]  And if we keep going and keep compounding, because in today's market, we buy way more than just one
[11:03.860 --> 11:09.700]  pound. We usually buy five or 10 pound lots at minimum. And in a five pound transaction,
[11:09.700 --> 11:16.500]  if you were weighing your ounces to 28 grams, you come to 28 grams short over a five pound
[11:16.500 --> 11:21.700]  transaction. So that's a full ounce. You have now shorted your customer. It doesn't sound like
[11:21.700 --> 11:25.860]  a lot of product on that large of a scale. It doesn't sound like a lot of money on that large
[11:25.860 --> 11:30.980]  of a scale. But when things are getting so tight in this industry, every gram and every dollar
[11:30.980 --> 11:36.420]  should count for both the buyer and the seller. So let's get on the same page. Let's start
[11:36.420 --> 11:42.580]  functioning on a 28.35 gram ounce so there is no argument. And let's do the math real quick here.
[11:42.580 --> 11:52.020]  28.35 times four, you should have 113.4 grams and a quarter pound. 28.35 times eight, a half a pound,
[11:52.020 --> 12:02.500]  226.8. Be friendly, make it 227. Don't be a dick. 28.35 times 16, you're looking at 453.6.
[12:02.500 --> 12:07.060]  If you want to round that up, that's 454 grams in a pound. If you want to be friendly, that's
[12:07.060 --> 12:13.860]  455 grams in a pound. But like I said, every gram and every dollar should count in today's
[12:13.860 --> 12:20.660]  market. Be a fair seller and people will be happy buyers. All right, you guys, that is my two cents
[12:20.660 --> 12:25.300]  on one ounce. I hope you learned something from that. You guys, I need to press pause. I need to
[12:25.300 --> 12:29.780]  get a drink. I'll probably take a couple of dabs. And when we get back, we're going to read some
[12:29.780 --> 12:34.660]  emails from some listeners. Take a dab with me, boys and girls, and I'll be right back.
[12:35.220 --> 12:39.460]  All right, podcast world, I am back. I am heavily medicated and well hydrated.
[12:39.460 --> 12:44.100]  Let's get right into these emails. If you'd like to send me an email, the email address is
[12:44.100 --> 12:50.100]  growfromyourheart.com. You know I'd like to hear from you. This first message goes like this.
[12:51.060 --> 12:55.300]  I've been enjoying your Learning to Grow series. I've been growing for many years now, but while
[12:55.300 --> 13:01.300]  I was listening, I was reminded of my biggest mistake during my first grow. I had a male,
[13:01.300 --> 13:06.820]  so I cut it up and flushed it down the toilet. Back then, I didn't know plant material will
[13:06.820 --> 13:12.740]  actually swell up when submerged in water. The plant got stuck in the whole house trap in my
[13:12.740 --> 13:19.300]  yard, and then it swelled up and plugged the pipe. Nothing in the house would drain. After freaking
[13:19.300 --> 13:25.220]  out for a while, I rented a power snake and spent the next eight hours bringing up disgusting,
[13:25.220 --> 13:32.420]  shitty bits of weed plant back up my sewer pipe. Everyone fucks up now and then. Keep up the good
[13:32.420 --> 13:38.500]  work. This listener had a male plant, and they cut it down and cut it into pieces and flushed
[13:38.500 --> 13:43.620]  it down the toilet, which ended up clogging up their whole drainage system. You guys,
[13:43.620 --> 13:48.900]  nothing grow-related should go down the toilet. Not plant material, not wastewater, not leftover
[13:48.900 --> 13:54.740]  nutrients, not runoff water, definitely not pesticides. All of that stuff finds its way back
[13:54.740 --> 14:00.420]  to our municipal water supply and gets fed back to us. Keep our water supply clean and pay attention
[14:00.420 --> 14:05.140]  to what goes down the toilet. Also, you may get yourself in trouble if you cause a major clog and
[14:05.140 --> 14:10.180]  you can't unclog it. Somebody has to come out, maybe the city. Maybe the city hires somebody.
[14:10.180 --> 14:13.940]  Whoever comes, they stick something down in there. They pull out half of a weed plant.
[14:13.940 --> 14:17.940]  They're going to want to find out where the rest of that weed plant is and where it came from and
[14:17.940 --> 14:22.340]  find out if there are more plants there. Don't flush your weed plants down the toilet, you guys.
[14:22.340 --> 14:27.380]  That will not work. That is not a proper way of disposing of your plants. I want to give a huge
[14:27.380 --> 14:32.500]  shout out to this listener for first acknowledging that they made a huge mistake, and then second for
[14:32.500 --> 14:37.540]  having the heart to admit it and share it with us so that we don't make a similar mistake in our
[14:37.540 --> 14:43.860]  garden and in our homes. Now, my next message comes from Dave in the UK, and it goes like this.
[14:43.860 --> 14:50.580]  Hey, Ross to Jeff, just a quick text from the UK. Love the podcasts. I've had them on back to back
[14:50.580 --> 14:55.460]  for a couple of weeks after discovering you. Great job, buddy. Hey, Dave, thanks for the great
[14:55.460 --> 15:00.900]  compliments. That's a great way to start a message. He goes on to say, reminded me of so many things I
[15:00.900 --> 15:08.180]  knew but forgot. Thanks for that. One thing, I just listened to episode 300. Great fucking laugh,
[15:08.180 --> 15:11.860]  by the way. Hey, dude, thanks for laughing with us. I'm glad you are learning and laughing at
[15:11.860 --> 15:16.660]  the same time. That always makes it fun. He says, plus in a couple other episodes,
[15:16.660 --> 15:21.860]  you were talking about popping or pinching the stems. I've not heard of this. Any chance you
[15:21.860 --> 15:27.060]  could explain this technique and how it's beneficial to your grow? Listening has totally
[15:27.060 --> 15:33.620]  given me a kick up the arse to get better and improve. I ordered some Lemon Jeffrey as souvenirs.
[15:33.620 --> 15:39.780]  Dude, I would come to work for free just to come soak up some of that knowledge. Oh, man,
[15:39.780 --> 15:44.100]  I appreciate the offer to come work for free. Maybe one of these days I will take you up on that,
[15:44.180 --> 15:50.580]  but let's get into the question about pinching and twisting and popping the stems on my plants.
[15:51.620 --> 15:57.060]  I first learned about twisting and popping the stems on my cannabis plants from a grower and
[15:57.060 --> 16:03.300]  breeder named Soma. When I learned about it through Soma, he was calling it super cropping.
[16:03.300 --> 16:08.500]  I adapted the technique and started doing it in my gardens. I got pretty good at it. I started
[16:08.500 --> 16:14.100]  using it in commercial grows. One day I was introduced to another grower who does a method
[16:14.100 --> 16:19.940]  of super cropping, but he goes way harder than I had ever thought of going. I would pop the stems
[16:19.940 --> 16:24.900]  a couple of times throughout the cycle and that would be it. This guy gets in there about every
[16:24.900 --> 16:30.500]  10 to 14 days and pops every inch of the plant. As soon as they're big enough to take it, as soon
[16:30.500 --> 16:36.340]  as they can tolerate it in veg, he starts cracking them. He encourages cracking the stems all the way
[16:36.340 --> 16:42.020]  through about the third week of flower. We started implementing the super cropping technique along
[16:42.020 --> 16:47.540]  with a trellis and netting system and that tremendously increased our yields and productivity
[16:47.540 --> 16:52.900]  of the plants. Now let's talk a little bit about what I'm doing, why I'm doing it, and why it works.
[16:53.620 --> 16:58.980]  One of the challenges of dealing with fast growing cannabis plants in a commercial environment
[16:58.980 --> 17:04.980]  is keeping them from growing too tall too quickly. We want plants that produce very quickly. We want
[17:04.980 --> 17:09.460]  rapid growth, but at the same time we don't need those plants growing too tall before they're
[17:09.460 --> 17:13.700]  finished. In most commercial environments we're limited by ceiling height. We can't have our
[17:13.700 --> 17:18.980]  plants growing into the lights. If you've got gavetas, you want about three, at least two feet
[17:18.980 --> 17:23.700]  between your lights and your plants, maybe more depending on what strain you're growing. Some
[17:23.700 --> 17:28.660]  plants don't like to get too close to those gavetas, so we need to keep height in mind when
[17:28.660 --> 17:33.780]  we're growing. How can I slow down some of that vertical growth but still keep strong robust
[17:33.780 --> 17:39.380]  plants? I thought that by cracking the stems and making the branches and the stalks thicker,
[17:39.380 --> 17:44.580]  the plants would be thicker and wider and they wouldn't have to grow as tall. Also, as I'm
[17:44.580 --> 17:49.780]  cracking them, that slows them down a little bit from getting taller. They're working more on
[17:49.780 --> 17:54.340]  repairing the cracks that I just made. Now I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me talk more about
[17:54.340 --> 18:00.820]  the actual method of popping the stems. As soon as my plant is transplanted into a three gallon pot,
[18:00.820 --> 18:06.660]  it's probably big enough to start cracking. I will grab the plant at the base of the stalk,
[18:06.660 --> 18:10.180]  right where it comes out of the medium, right where it comes out of your soil, your cocoa,
[18:10.180 --> 18:14.660]  whatever you're using, I grab it. You may need to grab it with your whole fist. You may need
[18:14.660 --> 18:19.460]  to be able to grab it with two fingers. It just depends on the size of the stalk. If it's the size
[18:19.460 --> 18:25.300]  of a pencil or bigger, this should work. If you're clumsy, maybe you want to work with a plant that's
[18:25.300 --> 18:30.660]  got a thicker stalk, maybe like a Sharpie marker. But this is what I do. I grab the stalk with one
[18:30.660 --> 18:36.820]  hand, maybe two fingers and my thumb. Then right above that, I grab it with my other hand, maybe
[18:36.820 --> 18:41.940]  two fingers, maybe the whole hand, depends on how I can grab it. Then I turn my hands opposite
[18:41.940 --> 18:47.220]  directions. Just give it a little twist and you'll hear just a little knuckle popping sound. You're
[18:47.220 --> 18:52.260]  basically going to give it the start of an Indian burn. And what you want to do is crack the cellulose
[18:52.260 --> 18:56.900]  walls. You just want to break the plant fiber. You don't want to bend it over. You don't want
[18:56.900 --> 19:01.780]  to topple it. You just want to twist it until you hear the plant fiber just snap. It'll make a real
[19:02.420 --> 19:07.140]  obvious cracking sound. It'll just be a little and you'll say, oh, that's exactly what I was
[19:07.140 --> 19:11.140]  looking for. You'll feel it. You'll hear it. It's just like popping your knuckle. So give it a little
[19:11.140 --> 19:16.500]  twist. And then I leave my hand that was on top right in place. And I take the hand that was on
[19:16.500 --> 19:22.500]  the bottom and just put it above the hand that is now on the bottom. And then I repeat the process
[19:22.500 --> 19:28.660]  and I just work my way up the stock and I'll do a crack every couple of inches. Crack, put my hand
[19:28.660 --> 19:33.540]  up top, crack, move the next hand up, crack, move my hand up, crack, and just keep going up the stock.
[19:33.540 --> 19:38.180]  I'll do the main stock all the way up until it gets real skinny toward the top. Then I'll go to
[19:38.180 --> 19:42.260]  the bottom branches and I'll start cracking the bottom branches and work my way all the way up to
[19:42.260 --> 19:48.980]  the top of each plant. We will spend an entire day in one room popping stems in a commercial grow.
[19:48.980 --> 19:55.940]  Every stem gets a good twisting and popping. Now we start this in veg and when we started in veg,
[19:55.940 --> 20:00.580]  it does slow the plants down from growing too tall, which is good, but it makes them get
[20:00.580 --> 20:06.020]  thicker, more robust stocks. Everywhere where we broke the stock a little bit, it creates a little
[20:06.020 --> 20:12.500]  knuckle there on the plant. And I feel like those little knuckles create stronger, sturdier stocks.
[20:12.500 --> 20:20.580]  And stronger, sturdier stocks can hold up stronger, thicker, fatter buds. Also, I feel like those
[20:20.580 --> 20:27.300]  thicker, fatter stocks can probably provide more nutrient flow and more water flow to the bigger,
[20:27.300 --> 20:33.700]  thick, fat buds that we're trying to produce. So I start cracking in veg to start building a strong,
[20:33.700 --> 20:37.780]  robust structure. I'm just working them out. I'm making them beefy. I'm putting some weight on them.
[20:37.780 --> 20:43.380]  I'm basically putting a collar with a tire on it, making my plants drag around that chain and tire
[20:43.380 --> 20:48.020]  all day so they get thick and beefy. And then I keep doing that through veg. And then I continue
[20:48.020 --> 20:52.580]  to do that through flower. And at the start of flower, we clean up the bottoms of them and we
[20:52.580 --> 20:57.460]  also defoliate heavy. So now the plants are being cracked and they don't have all the stuff on the
[20:57.460 --> 21:01.860]  bottom. They don't have as much leaf to work with. They've got a lot more structure and a lot more
[21:01.860 --> 21:06.660]  sturdiness without all the excess weight on them. We've kind of taken that dog chain and that tire
[21:06.660 --> 21:10.820]  off. And now those plants can run like an Olympic athlete. They're like, we've been training and
[21:10.820 --> 21:16.100]  we're ready to go. We keep cracking them for about three weeks into flower because the plants stretch
[21:16.100 --> 21:21.220]  heavily when we put them into flower. That crack really slows down that stretch. They spend more
[21:21.220 --> 21:26.980]  time repairing that crack than they do taking off, but they still transition very smoothly into the
[21:26.980 --> 21:32.500]  flowering process. And then we quit cracking them as bud sets. So that way they can quit spending
[21:32.500 --> 21:37.940]  their energy on repairing that cellulose structure and they can start spending all of their energy on
[21:37.940 --> 21:43.220]  producing luscious buds. After you get comfortable with popping and twisting, you'll learn how to
[21:43.220 --> 21:47.540]  start bending the plants to where you can point the branches where you want them to get them out
[21:47.540 --> 21:51.460]  of the way of each other, or maybe fill in a little space. Maybe you've got a little open
[21:51.460 --> 21:55.620]  section over here and two branches are crowded here. You'll learn how to just grab a branch and
[21:55.620 --> 22:00.180]  pop it and bend it to the direction you want. You can kind of pop it two or three times in different
[22:00.180 --> 22:04.980]  places and totally change the direction of a branch. That'll start coming in handy. Then you'll
[22:04.980 --> 22:10.260]  learn how to put up a trellis net and then you'll start popping the branches and twisting them into
[22:10.260 --> 22:14.980]  the trellis net. And that's when you really start learning how to shape the plant and shape the
[22:14.980 --> 22:21.300]  canopy to start maximizing your square footage for your canopy. So that is the main purpose of
[22:21.300 --> 22:26.420]  cracking and popping and twisting the stems. It does slow the plants down in vertical growth in
[22:26.420 --> 22:31.140]  the beginning, but once they heal from it, they do take off and you have more productive, more
[22:31.140 --> 22:36.500]  robust plants. And I think popping and twisting your plants is kind of a good training guide on
[22:36.500 --> 22:41.140]  getting good at trellising your plants. It'll teach you how to work the branches into the net a little
[22:41.140 --> 22:45.300]  better. It'll make you more comfortable at just grabbing a branch and giving it a twist, giving it
[22:45.300 --> 22:50.580]  a bend. You'll learn what the plants can tolerate and what they won't take. You'll learn eventually
[22:50.580 --> 22:55.140]  that you can go way lower. If you're trying to bend this branch into the trellis, you may not
[22:55.140 --> 23:00.180]  want to grab it six inches down and pop it. You may want to go 12 or 18 inches down, give it one
[23:00.180 --> 23:04.980]  good twist and a pop there, move up four or six inches, give it another pop there and use both of
[23:04.980 --> 23:09.540]  those two lower pops to start changing the direction of that branch so that you have a lot
[23:09.540 --> 23:14.420]  more space to work with. And then that branch is going to grow up no matter what. So you can kind
[23:14.420 --> 23:18.260]  of pop it down low, bend it the way you need it, get it into the net, and then it's going to grow
[23:18.260 --> 23:23.140]  back up. So popping and twisting is kind of the starter to that. That's where you learn how to do
[23:23.140 --> 23:26.900]  it. Then you'll throw up a trellis. Then you'll really get good at popping and twisting and
[23:26.900 --> 23:31.780]  working into that net system. So that's why it's beneficial. That's where it comes in super handy
[23:31.780 --> 23:37.300]  in a commercial grow system. And I feel like it really makes the plants more productive once they
[23:37.300 --> 23:42.580]  recover from all the popping and twisting that we do to them. So that is why I do popping and
[23:42.580 --> 23:47.860]  twisting and super cropping in a commercial grow. I hope that gives you another kick in the arse
[23:47.860 --> 23:53.220]  to do a little more work in the garden. I hope you enjoy collecting the Lemon Jeffery souvenirs.
