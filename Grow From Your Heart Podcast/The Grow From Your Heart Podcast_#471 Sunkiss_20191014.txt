[00:00.000 --> 00:01.560]  Hi, le ho, neighbors.
[00:01.560 --> 00:05.520]  It is time for episode 471 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:05.520 --> 00:09.260]  This episode of the show is brought to you by our friends at Seeds Here Now.
[00:09.260 --> 00:13.880]  If you need new regular, feminized, or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend
[00:13.880 --> 00:22.640]  Seeds Here Now, and you can find them at www.seedsherenow.com.
[00:22.640 --> 00:25.920]  You know, I like to start the podcast off by talking about when I'm smoking.
[00:25.920 --> 00:31.560]  Today I've been taking dabs of Halo Live Batter from our friends at Green Dot Labs.
[00:31.560 --> 00:34.520]  This is the Headbanger and Infinity OG.
[00:34.520 --> 00:37.920]  On the container, the flavor is described as deconstructed sour diesel.
[00:37.920 --> 00:40.320]  I think we've talked about this on the show before.
[00:40.320 --> 00:44.360]  I don't know what the hell deconstructed sour diesel is supposed to taste like.
[00:44.360 --> 00:49.680]  I do know that this concentrate smells deliciously disgusting, and it makes me stupid when I
[00:49.680 --> 00:53.160]  smoke it, so I am completely enjoying this.
[00:53.160 --> 00:59.160]  Big shout out to our friends at Green Dot Labs for the delicious Halo Live Batter.
[00:59.160 --> 01:03.320]  In this episode, I'm going to do a strain review or a strain report on one of my favorite
[01:03.320 --> 01:04.320]  crosses.
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.800]  Before I get there, I would like to do some shout outs to a couple of my friends on Patreon.
[01:09.800 --> 01:12.780]  Let's start off with a big Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out to my friend
[01:12.780 --> 01:13.780]  Miss Mel.
[01:13.780 --> 01:16.440]  I also want to send a shout out to our buddy Steve F.
[01:16.440 --> 01:20.200]  How about a Giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to Brian B.
[01:20.200 --> 01:22.440]  I want to send a giant thank you to Ethan G.
[01:22.520 --> 01:23.920]  How about a big shout out to Meredith.
[01:23.920 --> 01:28.280]  I want to send a giant Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out and thank you to Sour D.
[01:28.280 --> 01:30.320]  Of course, a big thank you to Tanner M.
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.640]  And last, but certainly not least, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast shout out, a thank
[01:35.640 --> 01:40.000]  you, a fist bump, and a high five to our friend Bafsta.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.280]  If anybody else out there would like to learn how to become a patron, all you need to do
[01:43.280 --> 01:49.420]  is go to www.patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:49.420 --> 01:52.400]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:52.400 --> 01:56.720]  Once again, big shout out and big thank you to everybody who has supported the Patreon
[01:56.720 --> 02:01.080]  campaign in the past, in the present, and in the future.
[02:01.080 --> 02:04.200]  Alright podcast world, let's not waste too much time in this episode.
[02:04.200 --> 02:07.320]  I did say that I wanted to do a strain review.
[02:07.320 --> 02:10.760]  Let's talk about one of my favorite strains that I have bred, also a strain that is getting
[02:10.760 --> 02:12.620]  really popular lately.
[02:12.620 --> 02:15.480]  Let's talk about a cross that I call Sunkiss.
[02:15.480 --> 02:17.200]  What is Sunkiss?
[02:17.200 --> 02:20.840]  Sunkiss is a cross of a female platinum tangy plant.
[02:20.840 --> 02:23.460]  Platinum tangy comes from our friends at the Garden of Weden.
[02:23.460 --> 02:26.240]  Big shout out to Maddie and Spence and the entire team Weden.
[02:26.240 --> 02:27.240]  What up kids?
[02:27.240 --> 02:28.240]  I miss you guys.
[02:28.240 --> 02:30.100]  Big high five and a fist bump to everybody out there.
[02:30.100 --> 02:32.360]  Make sure you scratch them dogs on the head for me.
[02:32.360 --> 02:33.720]  Good dogs, I miss you guys.
[02:33.720 --> 02:38.960]  Anyway, the platinum tangy is of course a platinum cookies, that is a platinum Girl
[02:38.960 --> 02:45.160]  Scout cookies female pollinated by a male tangy plant that was named Julius that was
[02:45.160 --> 02:48.040]  selected by Spence from the Garden of Weden.
[02:48.040 --> 02:52.680]  They pollinated the platinum cookies with the pollen from Julius and that created the
[02:52.680 --> 02:54.160]  platinum tangy.
[02:54.160 --> 02:56.440]  The platinum tangy is a wonderful plant.
[02:56.440 --> 02:59.040]  I came across this plant in a commercial cultivation.
[02:59.040 --> 03:03.080]  It had been selected by somebody else, but they did a great job with the selection.
[03:03.080 --> 03:06.160]  It was a very good representation of both parents.
[03:06.160 --> 03:11.920]  It had that cookies growth, the cookies potency, but it had that stink and that vigor of the
[03:11.920 --> 03:12.920]  tangy.
[03:12.920 --> 03:14.720]  It didn't take too long to flower.
[03:14.720 --> 03:16.400]  That plant was very pest resistant.
[03:16.400 --> 03:17.960]  It was very easy to grow.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.920]  It always gave impressive test results, impressive harvest, and the aromas and flavors were very
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.320]  unique, very orange dominant flavors in that cross.
[03:27.320 --> 03:29.920]  So Spence and Maddie did a wonderful job breeding it.
[03:29.920 --> 03:33.640]  Whoever did the phenotype selection did a wonderful job with the selection.
[03:33.640 --> 03:37.440]  I came across it in a commercial facility and quickly fell in love with it.
[03:37.440 --> 03:41.640]  I acquired a cut and I introduced that cut of the platinum tangy into my garden.
[03:41.640 --> 03:45.500]  I began playing with it and I've bred it to several things.
[03:45.540 --> 03:49.300]  In this case, we are going to talk about breeding it to the Arise.
[03:49.300 --> 03:51.580]  Everybody knows I work with a strain called Arise.
[03:51.580 --> 03:57.820]  Arise comes from a golden goat female pollinated by a daybreaker male.
[03:57.820 --> 04:01.740]  Daybreaker is not a well-known strain, so we'll talk about daybreaker briefly.
[04:01.740 --> 04:06.580]  Daybreaker is a chem D female pollinated by a Joseph OG male.
[04:06.580 --> 04:09.620]  So you've got chem dog and OG cushion there.
[04:09.620 --> 04:13.140]  Super stinky, super funky, really nice vigorous growth.
[04:13.140 --> 04:16.020]  Big fat white leaves, kind of short stocky plants.
[04:16.020 --> 04:22.100]  I put that pollen onto a golden goat female that made crazy plants.
[04:22.100 --> 04:23.680]  That is called Arise.
[04:23.680 --> 04:25.780]  That tests really high in THC.
[04:25.780 --> 04:27.500]  It grows with hyper vigor.
[04:27.500 --> 04:29.220]  It is just a wonderful plant to work with.
[04:29.220 --> 04:31.060]  The aromas and flavors are great.
[04:31.060 --> 04:37.020]  I found a male out of my Arise breeding project that I have named King Solomon.
[04:37.020 --> 04:41.860]  I have made many crosses from King Solomon and they all have proven to be tremendous
[04:41.860 --> 04:42.860]  crosses.
[04:42.860 --> 04:45.460]  Whatever King Solomon touches, it just improves it.
[04:45.460 --> 04:49.660]  If you've got a plant in this case that makes amazing orange turps and is very pest and
[04:49.660 --> 04:54.640]  pathogen resistant and is very easy to grow, you pollinate it with Solomon and all of those
[04:54.640 --> 04:56.140]  traits were amplified.
[04:56.140 --> 04:57.140]  It is more potent.
[04:57.140 --> 04:58.440]  It is easier to grow.
[04:58.440 --> 05:00.140]  It has more rapid vigor.
[05:00.140 --> 05:02.040]  It just seems to improve everything.
[05:02.040 --> 05:09.220]  So I took my prized King Solomon, my Arise male plant, and I sprinkled that magic dust
[05:09.220 --> 05:15.020]  all over that female platinum tangy and that created what I have called Sun Kiss.
[05:15.020 --> 05:19.220]  Now I'm sure you can assume with a name like Sun Kiss, we are going to have tremendous
[05:19.220 --> 05:21.060]  orange dominant turps.
[05:21.060 --> 05:24.460]  That is one of the most noticeable things about this cross.
[05:24.460 --> 05:25.980]  We'll talk about that in just a minute.
[05:25.980 --> 05:29.380]  Let's focus more on the growth characteristics of this plant.
[05:29.380 --> 05:30.380]  We've talked about the cross.
[05:30.380 --> 05:33.380]  It is a platinum tangy cross to Arise.
[05:33.380 --> 05:36.620]  The platinum tangy plant stays fairly short.
[05:36.620 --> 05:38.700]  That platinum tangy plant didn't get real big.
[05:38.700 --> 05:40.560]  It didn't have a giant main cola.
[05:40.560 --> 05:41.560]  It grows fairly even.
[05:41.560 --> 05:45.900]  It does have a dominant main apical top, but it wasn't that giant glory bud like a lot
[05:45.900 --> 05:47.140]  of plants get.
[05:47.140 --> 05:51.540]  Most of the buds stayed even and uniform, which makes it great for a commercial environment.
[05:51.540 --> 05:53.380]  So that's part of why I selected it.
[05:53.380 --> 05:54.740]  I bred it to the Arise.
[05:54.740 --> 05:57.380]  The Arise is known to grow very quickly.
[05:57.380 --> 05:59.220]  It will get kind of tall on you.
[05:59.220 --> 06:02.780]  I figured this would even out that shortness to that hyper vigor.
[06:02.780 --> 06:07.540]  I would add them together and it would just make a normal speed growth plant and it worked
[06:07.620 --> 06:09.220]  beautifully.
[06:09.220 --> 06:14.660]  Many of the phenotypes that come from the Sun Kiss stay shorter and a little bit wider.
[06:14.660 --> 06:19.440]  When you flower them, they don't have that amazing stretch that a lot of plants have.
[06:19.440 --> 06:23.040]  A lot of plants, when you flip them into flower for about three weeks, they're really going
[06:23.040 --> 06:24.380]  to take off.
[06:24.380 --> 06:27.820]  The Sun Kiss does not stretch as hard as a lot of other plants.
[06:27.820 --> 06:30.980]  That's really advantageous for most grows.
[06:30.980 --> 06:33.300]  She does grow a little bit wider than some plants.
[06:33.300 --> 06:34.740]  You may need a little bit more space.
[06:34.740 --> 06:38.620]  If most of the time you give your plants a two foot center, you may need a three foot
[06:38.620 --> 06:39.620]  center.
[06:39.620 --> 06:40.740]  If you're giving them a four, you may need a six.
[06:40.740 --> 06:44.220]  If you're starting with six, you may need to go eight feet with a Sun Kiss plant.
[06:44.220 --> 06:47.900]  You're going to get a little bit wider growth than what you're used to, but that is great
[06:47.900 --> 06:50.400]  because that means more production.
[06:50.400 --> 06:52.500]  Most of us are limited by plant counts.
[06:52.500 --> 06:56.140]  How many plants we can grow is dictated by our local government, by our local medical
[06:56.140 --> 06:57.140]  cannabis laws.
[06:57.140 --> 07:00.220]  If you're a personal home grower, so we need to keep the numbers low.
[07:00.220 --> 07:05.100]  Having a plant that branches out like this and produces really well is really advantageous.
[07:05.100 --> 07:06.420]  They stay a little bit shorter.
[07:06.420 --> 07:08.860]  They don't get as tall as many of the other plants.
[07:08.860 --> 07:10.900]  However, they will get a little bit wider.
[07:10.900 --> 07:16.220]  They will branch out, but they will not stretch as rapidly at the start of flower.
[07:16.220 --> 07:20.300]  That makes Sun Kiss a really good plant for something you want to trellis out.
[07:20.300 --> 07:23.660]  If you're working a screen, that is a really great plant for it.
[07:23.660 --> 07:24.660]  Just screen it out.
[07:24.660 --> 07:25.660]  It'll fill that screen real well.
[07:25.660 --> 07:30.460]  Then put a second screen about 12 to 16 inches above that, and it'll fill right into that
[07:30.460 --> 07:31.460]  net.
[07:31.460 --> 07:34.740]  If you're in a commercial environment, put up another net because it's going to get right
[07:34.740 --> 07:35.740]  into that net.
[07:35.740 --> 07:38.540]  If you've got those Govitas banging, it will grow into there.
[07:38.540 --> 07:39.540]  It's going to stay shorter.
[07:39.540 --> 07:41.060]  It's going to get a little bit wider.
[07:41.060 --> 07:43.500]  It's not going to stretch on you ridiculously tall.
[07:43.500 --> 07:46.260]  It's not going to have that major apical dominant top.
[07:46.260 --> 07:50.260]  If you want something that grows even canopy more easily so you don't have to cut that
[07:50.260 --> 07:54.140]  main top out if you're not into topping, this is a great plant for that sort of stuff.
[07:54.220 --> 07:59.780]  However, when you do top it, that bitch will really take off and branch out extra hard.
[07:59.780 --> 08:03.260]  This is a great plant for outdoor and greenhouses.
[08:03.260 --> 08:07.820]  Many people ask me, what would you recommend for an outdoor environment or a greenhouse
[08:07.820 --> 08:08.980]  from your lineup?
[08:08.980 --> 08:10.500]  I start off with the Sun Kiss.
[08:10.500 --> 08:13.740]  If you want a regular seed, I should mention this is not feminized.
[08:13.740 --> 08:16.740]  Since this comes from King Solomon, this is not a feminized seed.
[08:16.740 --> 08:18.300]  This is only regular.
[08:18.300 --> 08:19.860]  There is a feminized version.
[08:19.860 --> 08:21.220]  It is known as Michelangelo.
[08:21.220 --> 08:22.220]  It is very similar.
[08:22.260 --> 08:25.020]  It is currently sold out, but it will be back.
[08:25.020 --> 08:27.220]  Check out the Michelangelo if you need feminized seeds.
[08:27.220 --> 08:28.260]  Let's keep talking about this.
[08:28.260 --> 08:29.260]  Where the hell was I?
[08:29.260 --> 08:32.140]  A lot of people ask me my recommendation on outdoor strains.
[08:32.140 --> 08:33.420]  This is the one I recommend.
[08:33.420 --> 08:38.020]  I recommend the Sun Kiss because she doesn't take nearly as long to finish as a lot of
[08:38.020 --> 08:39.020]  my other plants.
[08:39.020 --> 08:43.060]  I've had people email me and say, hey dude, this plant's been going 45 or 50 days and
[08:43.060 --> 08:44.060]  she looks done.
[08:44.060 --> 08:45.060]  Is that possible?
[08:45.060 --> 08:47.660]  I say, send me pictures of the trichomes.
[08:47.660 --> 08:52.020]  Without a doubt, those plants were done at 45 or 50 days outdoors.
[08:52.020 --> 08:55.220]  These plants are great for outdoor or greenhouses.
[08:55.220 --> 08:58.540]  They are very pathogen and pest resistant.
[08:58.540 --> 09:00.260]  They don't get powdery mildew.
[09:00.260 --> 09:01.500]  They don't get mold.
[09:01.500 --> 09:06.500]  For some reason, the spider mites don't really seem to like the orange turps that come from
[09:06.500 --> 09:08.060]  this plant.
[09:08.060 --> 09:12.620]  Sun Kiss is a great selection for either a new grower or somebody who is trying to grow
[09:12.620 --> 09:15.940]  in an outdoor environment or in a greenhouse environment.
[09:15.940 --> 09:20.180]  A lot of my friends are on the coast, people up in the Pacific Northwest or up on the East
[09:20.180 --> 09:21.180]  Coast.
[09:21.180 --> 09:22.580]  They were saying, hey, what can I grow outdoors this year?
[09:22.580 --> 09:26.940]  I was recommending the Sun Kiss along with a couple of other things, but I like the Sun
[09:26.940 --> 09:31.740]  Kiss because it doesn't get powdery mildew and it tends to finish before people are going
[09:31.740 --> 09:33.980]  to have outdoor problems.
[09:33.980 --> 09:37.540]  Let's focus more on a few growth characteristics and then we'll move forward.
[09:37.540 --> 09:40.500]  She won't get too tall on you, but she will get kind of wide.
[09:40.500 --> 09:41.840]  She will not stretch.
[09:41.840 --> 09:45.140]  She will flower in less time than most of my other plants.
[09:45.140 --> 09:48.620]  I want to say that most phenotypes will be done around eight weeks.
[09:48.620 --> 09:53.300]  There are some outliers that will be done earlier and some that will be done later.
[09:53.300 --> 09:57.740]  Like I said before, I was getting reports of this strain being done at 45 and 50 days
[09:57.740 --> 09:58.740]  outdoors.
[09:58.740 --> 10:02.500]  I have also seen this plant go 65 or 70 days indoors.
[10:02.500 --> 10:05.980]  It just depends on your phenotype and we're going to talk about that in a minute.
[10:05.980 --> 10:09.340]  You do have the opportunity of finding early finishing phenotypes.
[10:09.340 --> 10:13.260]  I recommend you grow a crop indoors, find a good one for the outdoor, put that early
[10:13.260 --> 10:16.660]  finisher outdoor and grow the shit out of that next year outdoors.
[10:16.660 --> 10:18.540]  Put a bunch of clones of that one out there.
[10:18.580 --> 10:19.580]  You know what to do.
[10:19.580 --> 10:20.580]  You know what to expect.
[10:20.580 --> 10:21.820]  You know exactly how long it takes.
[10:21.820 --> 10:23.420]  That is setting yourself up for success.
[10:23.420 --> 10:26.320]  But there are some early finishing phenotypes.
[10:26.320 --> 10:28.820]  I can say eight to nine weeks on most phenotypes.
[10:28.820 --> 10:32.420]  A lot of them will finish around eight, some a little bit earlier.
[10:32.420 --> 10:36.100]  As a breeder, if I say that this plant will finish at seven weeks, people are going to
[10:36.100 --> 10:39.860]  expect it to be done at the end of seven weeks and they will email me when it's not.
[10:39.860 --> 10:41.200]  So I can't say that.
[10:41.200 --> 10:43.160]  Some phenotypes will do that.
[10:43.160 --> 10:45.420]  More typically, you're going to see eight weeks.
[10:45.420 --> 10:46.980]  Some will go nine weeks.
[10:46.980 --> 10:51.260]  Very untypically, but there will be some that will go 10 weeks.
[10:51.260 --> 10:54.660]  Another great thing about Sunkiss is that she clones very easily.
[10:54.660 --> 10:58.880]  If you're cloning in a cube, if you're cloning in rapid rooters, however you take your clones,
[10:58.880 --> 11:01.380]  you will have great success with Sunkiss.
[11:01.380 --> 11:03.300]  She is very easy to clone.
[11:03.300 --> 11:05.660]  And I believe that that comes from the platinum tangy.
[11:05.660 --> 11:06.900]  That plant just clones.
[11:06.900 --> 11:10.380]  You can just cut clones of it and set them on the table and they will make roots.
[11:10.380 --> 11:11.780]  So big shout out to Spence for that.
[11:11.780 --> 11:13.060]  That is great work there.
[11:13.060 --> 11:17.180]  But that platinum tangy makes it super easy to clone the Sunkiss plant.
[11:17.180 --> 11:18.940]  It just spits out roots no problem.
[11:18.940 --> 11:20.340]  They grow with great vigor.
[11:20.340 --> 11:24.000]  This plant will make robust stalks very quickly.
[11:24.000 --> 11:25.420]  These stalks get super thick.
[11:25.420 --> 11:29.180]  You may need to transplant these plants earlier than you're used to transplanting.
[11:29.180 --> 11:32.360]  You may want to speed up your schedule by about one full week.
[11:32.360 --> 11:35.740]  If you're working with good lighting and good soil and you've got proper nutrients and you
[11:35.740 --> 11:40.660]  know what you're doing, you could probably speed up your entire cycle by one full week
[11:40.780 --> 11:44.300]  by running something with the vigor that comes with the Sunkiss plant.
[11:44.300 --> 11:45.300]  It clones really quickly.
[11:45.300 --> 11:46.620]  It doesn't get too big.
[11:46.620 --> 11:47.620]  Where else was I?
[11:47.620 --> 11:48.620]  Oh, it's PM resistant.
[11:48.620 --> 11:54.060]  You are very unlikely to find powdery mildew on a Sunkiss plant, indoors or outdoors.
[11:54.060 --> 11:56.260]  I don't see powdery mildew on this plant.
[11:56.260 --> 11:58.120]  That is one of my favorite traits about it.
[11:58.120 --> 12:00.940]  That is partly why I recommend it to an indoor grower.
[12:00.940 --> 12:03.020]  Also, it does not get bugs.
[12:03.020 --> 12:04.980]  I don't find bugs on this plant.
[12:04.980 --> 12:09.340]  Nobody ever sends me a picture saying, hey, there are bugs on this Sunkiss plant.
[12:09.340 --> 12:12.700]  I get pictures of bugs on all other strains, but not Sunkiss.
[12:12.700 --> 12:15.580]  That is something that I think is really advantageous.
[12:15.580 --> 12:18.420]  If you're a new grower, this plant will work great for you.
[12:18.420 --> 12:21.140]  I don't see any intersex traits in this plant.
[12:21.140 --> 12:24.900]  I have never seen a photo of a hermaphroditic Sunkiss plant.
[12:24.900 --> 12:26.980]  This one is great for new growers.
[12:26.980 --> 12:30.620]  This one is also great for outdoor growers or greenhouse growers because it can really
[12:30.620 --> 12:32.820]  handle stress and mistakes.
[12:32.820 --> 12:34.800]  It also likes a lot of food.
[12:34.800 --> 12:37.460]  You can feed the shit out of a Sunkiss plant.
[12:37.460 --> 12:42.380]  I've got one friend who grows this plant in all organic, no-till type of environments,
[12:42.380 --> 12:43.620]  and he crushes it.
[12:43.620 --> 12:48.040]  It produces delicious orange crazy turps, and the plants are beautiful.
[12:48.040 --> 12:53.460]  I've grown this in a commercial environment using all veg bloom and commercial salty nutrients,
[12:53.460 --> 12:54.460]  and it crushes it.
[12:54.460 --> 12:55.980]  It puts out giant plants.
[12:55.980 --> 13:00.140]  I've seen all kinds of different environments really win with the Sunkiss.
[13:00.140 --> 13:02.020]  Again, this is an easy plant to grow.
[13:02.020 --> 13:05.500]  If you're a beginner or if you just need a break, if you're tired of struggling, this
[13:05.500 --> 13:06.580]  is an easy one to grow.
[13:06.700 --> 13:09.460]  This one kind of goes on autopilot if you know how to grow.
[13:09.460 --> 13:11.900]  She doesn't seem to get too upset if you miss a feed.
[13:11.900 --> 13:14.500]  She doesn't seem to get too upset if you overfeed.
[13:14.500 --> 13:18.900]  One great thing is she really doesn't mind if you fuck up the pH a little bit too much.
[13:18.900 --> 13:23.080]  I'm not going to encourage you to go in there and not adjust the pH, but if you're not the
[13:23.080 --> 13:26.980]  best grower, if you're kind of lazy and you're kind of not checking your pH, you're not going
[13:26.980 --> 13:28.140]  to mess up the crop with this one.
[13:28.140 --> 13:33.880]  I've seen some lazy growers, some new growers, and some pro growers all crush it with Sunkiss.
[13:33.880 --> 13:35.260]  She will get some pretty big buds.
[13:35.260 --> 13:38.700]  I said earlier that she doesn't get that big apical dominant bud, but she's going to
[13:38.700 --> 13:40.420]  grow some long branches.
[13:40.420 --> 13:43.860]  Those bottom branches are going to reach to the top, so they may need some supports.
[13:43.860 --> 13:45.460]  That's one thing I should recommend.
[13:45.460 --> 13:49.580]  I would recommend, I like growing with a trellis, like with a net with multiple layers of netting.
[13:49.580 --> 13:52.100]  I know that's not an option for everybody.
[13:52.100 --> 13:54.100]  In your environment, you may need a tomato cage.
[13:54.100 --> 13:56.660]  A tomato cage is great because the plants are going to bush out.
[13:56.660 --> 13:58.720]  They can fall right into that tomato cage.
[13:58.720 --> 14:02.980]  You can pull some branches down and strap them to the cage, or you can use sticks.
[14:02.980 --> 14:04.940]  I like to kind of spread this plant out.
[14:04.940 --> 14:09.140]  I kind of defoliate kind of heavily and let a lot of sunshine get into the bottom of that
[14:09.140 --> 14:10.140]  plant.
[14:10.140 --> 14:11.140]  You don't have to clean too far down.
[14:11.140 --> 14:15.180]  The bottoms of this plant are going to make fat buds also, so don't clean too far down
[14:15.180 --> 14:16.740]  as long as you get light in there.
[14:16.740 --> 14:20.020]  As far as the light goes, you will get buds with this plant.
[14:20.020 --> 14:22.700]  Some phenotypes will give you what I like to call taco leaf.
[14:22.700 --> 14:24.500]  It looks like they're getting too warm.
[14:24.500 --> 14:28.100]  I don't think those plants are always too warm when I see that taco leaf.
[14:28.100 --> 14:33.180]  I think that is just something in the genetics because I've seen it in multiple environments.
[14:33.180 --> 14:38.180]  The good thing about that taco leaf is it is usually just encrusted with trichomes.
[14:38.180 --> 14:41.860]  Some of your smaller leaves, not your fan leaves, but the secondary leaves that are
[14:41.860 --> 14:45.620]  coming out of the buds will just kind of curl up just a little bit and they'll just coat
[14:45.620 --> 14:48.000]  themselves in trichomes at the edges.
[14:48.000 --> 14:49.340]  Don't be worried if you see that.
[14:49.340 --> 14:50.780]  That is not a problem.
[14:50.780 --> 14:54.180]  What you do have to watch for is the tips of the leaves starting to look like they're
[14:54.180 --> 14:55.180]  crisping up.
[14:55.180 --> 14:57.020]  That is when you're giving it too much nutrient.
[14:57.020 --> 15:01.000]  Honestly, I think you're giving the plant just enough nutrient when you see, I call
[15:01.000 --> 15:02.140]  it getting their nails done.
[15:02.140 --> 15:05.540]  When you see the tips starting to cook, you know you've given it just to its limit.
[15:05.540 --> 15:06.540]  You're pushing it.
[15:06.540 --> 15:09.420]  It's starting to go, hey boss, do I really have to work this hard?
[15:09.420 --> 15:10.860]  That's when you can go, okay, that's your limit.
[15:10.860 --> 15:14.780]  I know how far you can go and you know, but there's a difference between stress, between
[15:14.780 --> 15:18.460]  too much heat and between just seeing those taco resin rails.
[15:18.460 --> 15:22.020]  If you're getting a little bit of a fold and a bunch of trichomes coming across that, you
[15:22.020 --> 15:23.660]  are not overheating those plants.
[15:23.660 --> 15:24.820]  They're loving life.
[15:24.820 --> 15:27.060]  That is just a trait of the plants.
[15:27.060 --> 15:31.580]  Now talking about traits, let's move toward talking about some of the phenotypes.
[15:32.020 --> 15:33.540]  Most of the phenotypes are fairly uniform.
[15:33.540 --> 15:37.740]  We're going to see platinum tangy dominant phenotypes and then we're going to see a rise
[15:37.740 --> 15:39.160]  dominant phenotypes.
[15:39.160 --> 15:43.660]  Most of them, like I was talking about earlier, are going to be a beautiful combination.
[15:43.660 --> 15:47.580]  We've got short squat plants that grow kind of wide with a lot of vigor.
[15:47.580 --> 15:49.780]  You're going to get some that are a little taller.
[15:49.780 --> 15:52.040]  You're going to get some that show a little bit of stretch.
[15:52.040 --> 15:55.800]  For the most part, they're going to be dense, wide plants.
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.780]  Most of the phenotype differences are going to express themselves in aroma.
[15:59.780 --> 16:04.740]  You're going to get straight up oranges, like a basket of fresh, delicious oranges
[16:04.740 --> 16:08.900]  that somebody cut one open right in the middle so it smells real citrusy in the room.
[16:08.900 --> 16:12.740]  You're going to get a real orange dominant type of a phenotype.
[16:12.740 --> 16:16.900]  Then we're going to get sort of a gassy, funky orange phenotype.
[16:16.900 --> 16:21.220]  It's oranges and feet and that's coming from the Daybreaker, which is coming from the Joseph
[16:21.220 --> 16:25.180]  O.G. side of things, coming from the Chemdog side of things, putting a little bit of musty
[16:25.180 --> 16:27.060]  foot into that orange.
[16:27.060 --> 16:31.500]  That's maybe like if you got to eat a slice of oranges from somebody's dirty feet, which
[16:31.500 --> 16:34.700]  when it comes to cannabis, that's a fucking ideal sort of a smell.
[16:34.700 --> 16:37.260]  Then there was another phenotype that is a little bit different.
[16:37.260 --> 16:40.180]  It is a little, I call it a sharper of an aroma.
[16:40.180 --> 16:42.620]  It is a little bit more of an orange rind.
[16:42.620 --> 16:44.980]  It's more like you bit too far down into the orange.
[16:44.980 --> 16:48.800]  You shouldn't have eaten that far and it tastes a little bit bitter, but it's still real citrusy
[16:48.800 --> 16:50.700]  and it's still really sweet.
[16:50.700 --> 16:55.700]  That one smells a little bit funky on its own, but it makes amazing concentrates.
[16:55.700 --> 16:57.900]  The concentrates don't come out with that bitter smell.
[16:57.900 --> 17:01.980]  They come out super Jolly Rancher orange candy sweet.
[17:01.980 --> 17:03.660]  It is really delicious.
[17:03.660 --> 17:08.060]  So that if you've got that astringent, funky orange grapefruit sort of a smelling one in
[17:08.060 --> 17:12.660]  the beginning, it is going to turn into straight up orange candies when it dries and cures
[17:12.660 --> 17:15.060]  or when you make concentrates out of it.
[17:15.060 --> 17:19.780]  That phenotype is identifiable because it is taller and has skinnier leaves.
[17:19.780 --> 17:22.820]  That is going to be the grapefruit flavored phenotype.
[17:22.820 --> 17:27.100]  I believe that that comes from the golden goat side of things.
[17:27.100 --> 17:32.420]  I think that that is either the Island Sweet Skunk or possibly the Romulan doing that.
[17:32.420 --> 17:38.180]  I really think that there's a grapefruit characteristic in the Island Sweet Skunk, a sweet pink grapefruit
[17:38.180 --> 17:41.460]  terp that is just hidden back in there somewhere in the genetics.
[17:41.460 --> 17:42.500]  It is in there.
[17:42.500 --> 17:46.760]  I unlock it occasionally when I cross the golden goat to other things, it comes out.
[17:46.760 --> 17:49.420]  When I cross the Arise to other things, that terp comes out.
[17:49.420 --> 17:53.380]  I really believe that's coming from the golden goat, from the Island Sweet Skunk and the
[17:53.380 --> 17:54.380]  golden goat.
[17:54.380 --> 17:58.780]  It is a grapefruit, sweet pink grapefruit, sugary grapefruit sort of a terp.
[17:58.780 --> 18:00.420]  You'll smell that in flour.
[18:00.420 --> 18:05.440]  You'll smell that in the drying cure process and that will drop out and it becomes complete
[18:05.440 --> 18:07.660]  orange Jolly Rancher candies.
[18:07.660 --> 18:11.760]  Not like orange powder, not like orange juice, but that sweet, like when you put a Jolly
[18:11.760 --> 18:15.140]  Rancher in your mouth and your tongue gets wet, you're like, that's orangey.
[18:15.140 --> 18:17.460]  It is that sort of an orangey sort of a thing.
[18:17.500 --> 18:21.340]  If you make good concentrates out of that, if you can make a good BHO or a good live
[18:21.340 --> 18:25.100]  batter or I'm not dissing whatever you're doing, I like a good BHO concentrate.
[18:25.100 --> 18:28.220]  I feel like it really brings out a good clean terp profile.
[18:28.220 --> 18:32.120]  You can really taste that orange candy just chilling on your tongue and just dances around
[18:32.120 --> 18:34.000]  for a little while.
[18:34.000 --> 18:35.000]  Really delicious.
[18:35.000 --> 18:37.140]  So that's the taller phenotype is what's going to make that.
[18:37.140 --> 18:38.140]  That's where I was with that.
[18:38.140 --> 18:41.480]  Sorry, I got distracted by enjoying that pheno flavor in my mouth.
[18:41.480 --> 18:45.440]  But if you're looking for that grapefruit terp dominant phenotype, you want the taller
[18:45.440 --> 18:47.320]  one with the skinnier, longer leaves.
[18:47.320 --> 18:50.100]  Again, I believe that comes from the Island Sweet Skunk.
[18:50.100 --> 18:53.480]  If you want just the straight orangey terps, I believe that comes from the one with the
[18:53.480 --> 18:55.180]  more compact leaves.
[18:55.180 --> 18:56.960]  The leaves stay really close to the plant.
[18:56.960 --> 18:58.840]  The petioles don't get really long.
[18:58.840 --> 19:02.200]  And if you've got the one with the purple petioles, you've probably got the one that
[19:02.200 --> 19:06.200]  has got a little bit of foot to it because those long purple petioles are a trait of
[19:06.200 --> 19:09.260]  the Daybreaker and that's where you're going to get the foot aroma.
[19:09.260 --> 19:12.360]  So those are probably the three different phenotypes you're going to find.
[19:12.360 --> 19:13.360]  You're going to find the straight oranges.
[19:14.280 --> 19:18.080]  You're going to find oranges and gas, and then you're going to get the astringent grapefruit
[19:18.080 --> 19:20.560]  rind, kind of orange peel oranges.
[19:20.560 --> 19:21.560]  They're all delicious.
[19:21.560 --> 19:22.560]  They're all amazing.
[19:22.560 --> 19:24.720]  They're all beautiful in their own way.
[19:24.720 --> 19:29.580]  You may find some different combos of different things therein, but I think you will be happy
[19:29.580 --> 19:31.760]  with any phenotype you get of Sunkiss.
[19:31.760 --> 19:37.160]  I have never gotten any bad reviews or negative feedback on Sunkiss.
[19:37.160 --> 19:41.900]  And as a seed maker, as a breeder who has put out a lot of seeds, I do get feedback.
[19:41.900 --> 19:45.460]  And some of it, unfortunately, is negative, but that's how you improve a business.
[19:45.460 --> 19:47.040]  That's how you improve a product.
[19:47.040 --> 19:49.220]  There's always going to be some type of negative feedback.
[19:49.220 --> 19:50.220]  That's how you improve.
[19:50.220 --> 19:53.600]  But I never get any negative feedback from Sunkiss.
[19:53.600 --> 19:55.000]  So I've talked about the phenotypes.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.620]  That kind of talked about the flavors, mostly oranges.
[19:57.620 --> 19:59.420]  It is just orange candy.
[19:59.420 --> 20:04.300]  Some of those orange Tic Tac sort of flavors, not as much like orange tang, but more fresh
[20:04.300 --> 20:06.880]  oranges, gassy oranges.
[20:06.880 --> 20:12.240]  And then that straight up Jolly Rancher, sweet, delicious, drooly kind of orange flavor.
[20:12.240 --> 20:14.240]  Those are the flavors you're going to get.
[20:14.240 --> 20:17.600]  Now let's talk a little bit about the buzz from Sunkiss.
[20:17.600 --> 20:23.360]  A lot of people ask me for advice on flowers or concentrates that would reduce anxiety
[20:23.360 --> 20:24.720]  or kind of calm them down.
[20:24.720 --> 20:28.320]  A lot of people get too high and they get anxious when they smoke or they're already
[20:28.320 --> 20:30.100]  experiencing anxiety.
[20:30.100 --> 20:33.680]  Some people want something that will help them in a social situation just to be a little
[20:33.680 --> 20:36.700]  more available for social activity.
[20:36.700 --> 20:39.680]  Some of us don't want to go out until we smoke and then it kind of makes your brain
[20:39.680 --> 20:40.680]  a little more friendly.
[20:40.680 --> 20:43.060]  You want to go be around more people, be more social.
[20:43.060 --> 20:46.580]  A lot of people ask me for that type of a strain.
[20:46.580 --> 20:51.020]  I often recommend Sunkiss for that type of situation.
[20:51.020 --> 20:54.300]  Sunkiss will give you a nice, friendly, smiley buzz.
[20:54.300 --> 20:57.720]  You want to talk, you want to be around other people, and it doesn't give you that I hate
[20:57.720 --> 21:02.000]  society kind of vibe that a lot of people sort of seem to wake up with.
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.140]  It also just puts a smile on your face and it'll give you a nice buzz without making
[21:06.140 --> 21:07.140]  you anxious.
[21:07.140 --> 21:11.820]  If you're prone to getting anxiety when you smoke, something about the orange turps are
[21:11.820 --> 21:15.060]  real calming, are real, they put you in a friendly mood.
[21:15.060 --> 21:16.420]  They're just friendly orange turps.
[21:16.420 --> 21:18.220]  I can't describe it any other way.
[21:18.220 --> 21:22.620]  There are very few people that when they smell oranges, they say, that is unpleasant.
[21:22.620 --> 21:26.160]  Most of the planet really enjoys an orange fragrant turp.
[21:26.160 --> 21:28.060]  That is something that is really popular.
[21:28.060 --> 21:31.020]  Those fruity sort of turps make almost everybody happy.
[21:31.020 --> 21:33.580]  The orange smell just puts everybody in a good mood.
[21:33.700 --> 21:36.820]  When you smoke those orange turps, it really just lifts you up.
[21:36.820 --> 21:39.780]  It's like a good breakfast dab or a good breakfast joint.
[21:39.780 --> 21:43.180]  If you're looking for something to smoke during the day that's not going to bog you out, that's
[21:43.180 --> 21:46.620]  not going to make you too stupid, that's going to keep you peppy, going to keep your brain
[21:46.620 --> 21:50.820]  moving, going to keep you social, keep you functioning with people, or if you're looking
[21:50.820 --> 21:54.280]  for cannabis that you can smoke that doesn't make you too anxious, because a lot of people
[21:54.280 --> 21:58.380]  get that anxiety, you take a dab and you just start, oh shit, I got to go.
[21:58.380 --> 22:00.540]  This will not give you dab anxiety.
[22:00.540 --> 22:02.580]  This should not give you smoke anxiety.
[22:02.580 --> 22:06.540]  If you want something that is great for breakfast smoke, for daytime smoke, SunKiss is the way
[22:06.540 --> 22:07.580]  to go.
[22:07.580 --> 22:11.020]  If you've got to go talk to people and you're not really in the mood to be around people,
[22:11.020 --> 22:14.360]  if you've got to maybe work somewhere where you've got to deal with customers, SunKiss
[22:14.360 --> 22:18.980]  just may put a smile on your face that you might not have had when you started the day.
[22:18.980 --> 22:20.940]  That is my brief report on SunKiss.
[22:20.940 --> 22:24.340]  At this point, I would usually talk about problems and struggles you would run into
[22:24.340 --> 22:28.620]  while growing this plant, but this plant is such a breeze to grow that I really don't
[22:28.620 --> 22:30.120]  think you're going to find problems.
[22:30.120 --> 22:33.160]  Like I said, I don't get negative feedback on this plant.
[22:33.160 --> 22:37.360]  The only problem you will have with SunKiss is that if you leave the jar around, somebody
[22:37.360 --> 22:40.880]  will smoke all of your buds because that shit smells delicious.
[22:40.880 --> 22:44.600]  All right, podcast world, that is my story and I am sticking to it.
[22:44.600 --> 22:48.920]  If you would like to add some SunKiss seeds to your garden, I've got a few sources I can
[22:48.920 --> 22:50.000]  suggest for you.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.520]  I would start off by checking with seedsherenow.com.
[22:53.520 --> 22:57.400]  You may also be able to find SunKiss seeds at the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[22:57.400 --> 23:00.920]  You can find them at dankseed.store.
[23:00.920 --> 23:07.080]  Also I can recommend the Oregon Elite Seed Company at oregoneliteseeds.com.
[23:07.080 --> 23:08.080]  Make sure you shop around.
[23:08.080 --> 23:09.400]  Check out all three vendors.
[23:09.400 --> 23:12.320]  They all offer different sales and specials at different times.
[23:12.320 --> 23:16.520]  I know everybody has their preferred seed bank, so shop where you're comfortable.
[23:16.520 --> 23:22.240]  Once again, I recommend seedsherenow, the Hella Dank Seed Company, and Oregon Elite
[23:22.240 --> 23:23.240]  Seeds.
[23:23.240 --> 23:27.280]  I can promise you that those are official iRegenetics SunKiss seeds.
[23:27.280 --> 23:28.560]  If that is where you get them.
[23:28.560 --> 23:32.280]  All right, podcast world, I think that is all I've got for you for this episode.
[23:32.280 --> 23:35.160]  Thank you for listening to my strain review on SunKiss.
[23:35.160 --> 23:39.200]  If you get some SunKiss seeds and you do a grow with them, I would love to see your photos.
[23:39.200 --> 23:42.680]  Send me photos of any iRegenetics plants you are growing.
[23:42.680 --> 23:44.240]  That is how I select new testers.
[23:44.240 --> 23:47.800]  If I like the photos that you send me of your current grow and I have new seeds that I need
[23:47.800 --> 23:51.960]  grown, those are the photos I look through to find candidates to be potential testers
[23:51.960 --> 23:52.960]  in the future.
[23:52.960 --> 23:56.920]  So please send me your photos of any iRegenetics strains you may be growing.

[24:49.160 --> 24:50.640]  So we are done with this episode.
