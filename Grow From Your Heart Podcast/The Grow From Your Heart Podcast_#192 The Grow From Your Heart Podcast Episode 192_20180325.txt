[00:17.020 --> 00:19.540]  Welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:19.540 --> 00:22.980]  It's time for episode number 192 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:23.060 --> 00:27.140]  You're a source for cannabis news, education, and conversation. That's right.
[00:27.140 --> 00:29.100]  If you're a new grower, if you're a professional grower,
[00:29.260 --> 00:32.860]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber, if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:32.980 --> 00:35.860]  or even someone who's just curious about the current state of cannabis,
[00:36.220 --> 00:40.660]  this my friends is the podcast for you. I'm your host. My friends call me,
[00:40.660 --> 00:43.780]  Rasta Jeff. I want to thank you guys again for joining me. As always,
[00:43.820 --> 00:46.580]  I need to send a huge thank you shout out to my friends in the Mystic Roots
[00:46.580 --> 00:50.140]  band for letting me use their music on my podcast. Big thanks to Kat,
[00:50.660 --> 00:55.580]  Coot and the entire Mystic Roots crew. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:55.580 --> 00:58.660]  Mike is on the podcast, but as we were doing the intro music,
[00:58.660 --> 01:03.580]  he took a little tiny micro dab and he gave me the kill the mic sign and his
[01:03.580 --> 01:05.540]  microphones turned off. I don't know where the fuck he went.
[01:05.540 --> 01:10.100]  He rambled off somewhere into my house. He's wandering around somewhere,
[01:10.100 --> 01:13.020]  bathroom, living room area. Oh, he has emerged through the clouds of smoke.
[01:13.020 --> 01:17.420]  There is Mike. He's a several shades of pink and purple, but he will be back.
[01:17.660 --> 01:19.340]  White Mike is on the podcast with us today.
[01:19.340 --> 01:22.580]  Everybody laugh at white Mike for taking too big of a dab and changing colors.
[01:23.300 --> 01:24.420]  He just headed to the men's room.
[01:24.500 --> 01:26.540]  We'll find out what happened to Mike in a couple of seconds.
[01:26.540 --> 01:29.060]  If he doesn't make it back by the time the song's over,
[01:29.420 --> 01:32.580]  we might go look for him. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining me.
[01:33.300 --> 01:36.140]  I had to take a little break from trimming. I've been trimming ganja all day.
[01:36.260 --> 01:39.460]  Been trimming some grateful dog. Smells delicious.
[01:39.500 --> 01:42.860]  It was grown with a veg bloom nutrients. I gotta say,
[01:42.860 --> 01:46.300]  I'm impressed veg bloom nutrients with a little mammoth microbes thrown in there.
[01:47.060 --> 01:50.380]  I added a few extra things, but uh, I'm impressed. It smells good.
[01:50.460 --> 01:53.220]  I got a different color purple out of this that I've never seen.
[01:53.740 --> 01:56.340]  Usually this grateful dog, that's my cut of grateful dog.
[01:56.340 --> 01:58.500]  You guys have strained that I bred. This is the keeper I selected.
[01:59.020 --> 02:02.020]  Usually it makes a kind of a dark purple pine cone shaped,
[02:02.020 --> 02:05.340]  but this time it was really light purple and it made longer spears.
[02:05.860 --> 02:08.220]  I don't know the final weight yet cause I'm not done trimming it.
[02:08.740 --> 02:13.180]  I will know probably by the end of tomorrow we'll know if it increased or
[02:13.180 --> 02:15.580]  reduced my harvest weight. We'll find out soon enough.
[02:16.420 --> 02:18.300]  I had to take a break from trimming. Just gonna hand cramp.
[02:21.060 --> 02:23.740]  I'm glad Mike's here. I'm gonna make him trim with me. If he survived that dad,
[02:23.780 --> 02:27.820]  there he is. Mike's coming back. Yeah. All right. I'll turn your mic on bro.
[02:27.900 --> 02:28.740]  How you doing over there, man?
[02:28.940 --> 02:31.820]  I'm a lot good and slide that Mike kind of inferny a little bit.
[02:31.820 --> 02:33.420]  You guys are gonna hear some bumps and scrapes and shit.
[02:33.420 --> 02:36.140]  He's just moving a microphone stand. You can cough on the show.
[02:36.140 --> 02:38.260]  That's acceptable. I just bumped my hand on the chair.
[02:38.260 --> 02:40.780]  That kind of hurt a little bit. Welcome to the show, bro. How you doing?
[02:40.980 --> 02:44.420]  Doing good, man. All right guys. Make sure while Mike coughs it off,
[02:44.420 --> 02:46.780]  make sure you follow Mike on Twitter. It's at emo punk 15.
[02:46.780 --> 02:50.740]  Also check out Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws. That's Mike's Facebook group.
[02:50.740 --> 02:53.260]  Nailed it buddy. Yeah. I tried to help you out, man. Thank you.
[02:53.460 --> 02:56.540]  While you're over there getting your color back, wiping the sweat off your face.
[02:58.220 --> 03:00.500]  All right. I think Mike's alive. Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:01.420 --> 03:05.020]  we spoiled the people last week. Mike, they got three podcasts,
[03:05.580 --> 03:09.180]  content, crazy content. Crazy is what he was trying to say.
[03:09.180 --> 03:13.500]  Monday choking and drinking at the same time. Sorry folks. Give me a second.
[03:13.500 --> 03:16.380]  I'll be all good to go. Mike, you're cool. Get your, get your color back,
[03:16.380 --> 03:18.940]  get your voice back. And when, when you're back there, you can jump on it.
[03:18.940 --> 03:21.060]  And your mic is on buddy. Don't, don't, don't, don't worry.
[03:21.060 --> 03:22.500]  We're going to use you in just a couple of minutes.
[03:22.500 --> 03:25.660]  We're going to talk about some laws and some adjustments to some proposed laws.
[03:25.660 --> 03:28.620]  And that's when Mike will be super useful. Three episodes last week.
[03:28.620 --> 03:30.900]  I hope you guys caught all three of them. Dude loved it.
[03:31.020 --> 03:34.220]  Did the normal Monday episode. Mike joined me for that one. No,
[03:34.260 --> 03:36.620]  it was a Wednesday. I did normal Monday episode by myself.
[03:36.860 --> 03:41.220]  Dropped a Wednesday episode with Mike on Wednesday. Then Thursday I did the old,
[03:41.460 --> 03:44.220]  the revisited damn bro. You're still coughing and turning colors.
[03:46.740 --> 03:50.780]  You need to quit smoking those cigarettes, bro. Yeah. Cigarettes are the devil.
[03:50.820 --> 03:54.500]  Slavery in a box. I've got a dab right. Coming up here in a minute.
[03:54.540 --> 03:57.860]  Oh, Mike's going to Mexico. He's going to have to not take. Yeah.
[03:57.860 --> 04:00.660]  Be careful, dude. Come back with your head. That's all I ask. Right.
[04:01.300 --> 04:04.100]  You taking baby? Yep. Oh man. It's going to be fun. Oh,
[04:04.100 --> 04:06.500]  it's going to be nice. Little man's first trip to out of the country.
[04:06.500 --> 04:10.740]  First trip anywhere. First trip anywhere. Hospital in Denver. Yep. Oh man.
[04:10.780 --> 04:14.260]  It's going to be a fun time. Oh yeah. Good luck on that. Good luck on that.
[04:14.260 --> 04:17.740]  So sober break. Right. I'm sure. I'm sure there's some, uh,
[04:17.740 --> 04:21.220]  some tequila in the hotel. International travel with a two year old.
[04:21.940 --> 04:26.900]  I get all of my family for the first time in like 15 years and I get sober.
[04:27.540 --> 04:30.980]  You have a big, weird smile on your face for your birthday.
[04:31.260 --> 04:34.380]  It's going to be a fun next couple of days. When you get back,
[04:35.260 --> 04:37.900]  come hang out with Rasta Jeff and we won't record.
[04:37.900 --> 04:40.540]  We'll just get you so high that you don't stop coughing.
[04:40.540 --> 04:42.180]  After my last little break,
[04:42.580 --> 04:47.140]  one little hit on the bowl that I had left on my desk when we left for the trip
[04:47.620 --> 04:51.660]  was all it took to green me out for the day. So we are way off topic,
[04:51.660 --> 04:55.020]  but I like that. Uh, how much at this point in time,
[04:55.020 --> 04:59.860]  how much do you normally consume? And I'm going to ask a followup question. Uh,
[04:59.900 --> 05:01.220]  but I'm going to ask it before I forget.
[05:01.220 --> 05:04.860]  Is that based on budget or does that satisfy your need?
[05:05.780 --> 05:10.060]  Um, I'm lucky I found a way to do both. Okay.
[05:10.340 --> 05:13.620]  Um, I stockpile when I'm able.
[05:14.420 --> 05:15.260]  And there you go.
[05:15.300 --> 05:18.700]  Some of it for long time listeners or regular listeners are familiar with my
[05:18.700 --> 05:22.060]  vintage vintage hash collection now. Um,
[05:22.620 --> 05:24.020]  yeah, Mike's kind of a hash hoarder.
[05:24.820 --> 05:27.940]  I stock up and now I've got hash. It's like a year and a half old.
[05:30.300 --> 05:32.220]  Oh, it's wonderful. Gets me crazy high.
[05:32.260 --> 05:37.100]  And some of the stuff that breaks down as it ages is really effective
[05:37.100 --> 05:37.940]  medically.
[05:37.940 --> 05:40.340]  Okay. I'm sure it changes with the cannabinoids changes.
[05:40.340 --> 05:41.740]  They break down and as it gets older,
[05:41.740 --> 05:46.340]  Stoney, but a little more medically active, but uh,
[05:47.780 --> 05:49.700]  I don't know, daily consumption or.
[05:50.060 --> 05:51.860]  Yeah. How much do you smoke on a normal day?
[05:51.980 --> 05:54.660]  Unless I'm hurting from something specific. Like I,
[05:54.660 --> 05:57.780]  I did something and really hurt my back or something, uh,
[05:57.780 --> 05:59.900]  to just manage the, my normal pain,
[06:00.620 --> 06:03.700]  usually around a gram of flour a day with
[06:05.580 --> 06:09.780]  anywhere between like one and five or seven dabs thrown in throughout the
[06:09.780 --> 06:11.660]  course. I mean, tiny little me dabs.
[06:11.700 --> 06:13.260]  Little tiny micro Mike dabs.
[06:13.340 --> 06:16.900]  Yep. Throughout the day. Um, if I'm doing nothing all day,
[06:17.140 --> 06:21.540]  like if it's just a me day and I can kind of go with the flow and I'm not
[06:21.540 --> 06:24.940]  trying to, to do nothing all day and just medicate.
[06:25.340 --> 06:27.340]  Cause I can go through a lot more than that.
[06:28.500 --> 06:33.500]  All right. So one gram of flour and seven dabs throughout the day.
[06:34.340 --> 06:37.580]  Like seven dabs would be like, I was dabbing a lot that day. Okay.
[06:37.620 --> 06:41.500]  So probably today, the one I'm coughing on is my third dab of the day.
[06:41.940 --> 06:45.820]  Oh, okay. And you took two of those here. Yep. All right. Okay.
[06:45.820 --> 06:47.620]  So you got through and it's almost nine o'clock at night.
[06:47.620 --> 06:50.860]  The only reason I took another one today is because a friend came by the house
[06:50.860 --> 06:52.980]  real quick and was like, what a dab real quick. Nice.
[06:53.260 --> 06:55.100]  Shout out to whoever dabbed out Mike. Yep.
[06:56.740 --> 07:00.620]  But yeah, it's, it's typically mostly flour until I'm, I mean, nine or 10.
[07:01.740 --> 07:04.540]  Okay. And until the kid goes to bed and things get calm,
[07:04.660 --> 07:09.140]  the kid gets to bed and then I get like the stuff around the house done that
[07:09.140 --> 07:12.300]  like, I can't do all, I'm also caring for him. Yeah.
[07:12.340 --> 07:16.420]  So there's usually some scrambling. Yeah. Right. Dishes, laundry,
[07:16.420 --> 07:18.540]  anything that requires more than three fingers. Yeah.
[07:19.060 --> 07:22.460]  That sounds weird. Like 5% of your thought. Yeah.
[07:22.540 --> 07:24.340]  Anything you gotta pay too much attention to. Yep.
[07:24.380 --> 07:26.100]  Anything that can't handle itself.
[07:26.180 --> 07:30.260]  You gotta wait till he goes down to take care of the most part. Um,
[07:30.300 --> 07:32.180]  and as soon as I get that stuff wrapped up,
[07:32.220 --> 07:35.420]  like I can chill and dab and relax and enjoy my day.
[07:35.580 --> 07:38.780]  So you're smoking a gram of flour and probably on average,
[07:38.780 --> 07:43.180]  sounds closer to five dabs a day maybe. And your dabs,
[07:43.380 --> 07:46.140]  a gram could last you two weeks at the rate you dab.
[07:46.260 --> 07:47.500]  Well, I, the,
[07:47.540 --> 07:51.580]  that's the other trick with trying to convert the number of dabs I take in a
[07:51.580 --> 07:56.380]  given time period to a weight is I've got like 50 or 60 different
[07:56.380 --> 07:59.820]  grams that I'm actively dabbing from.
[08:00.380 --> 08:04.460]  And so one dab from here, one dab from there, one dab from over here.
[08:05.180 --> 08:08.580]  I've never taken the time to weigh out one of my dabs at home.
[08:08.580 --> 08:09.420]  So I really can't.
[08:10.580 --> 08:14.460]  Like 0.09 like not even 0.1.
[08:14.900 --> 08:15.860]  Yeah. They're pretty small.
[08:15.900 --> 08:18.100]  0.05 maybe they're a little dabs.
[08:18.500 --> 08:22.380]  Um, they've been getting bigger. Um,
[08:22.500 --> 08:26.180]  but uh, I, I usually go pretty small, just my lungs.
[08:26.180 --> 08:27.260]  Don't like the big hot ones.
[08:27.340 --> 08:29.300]  And you guys, some, some listeners are going to wait.
[08:29.300 --> 08:31.260]  Did he just say he had 50 grams? Yeah.
[08:31.260 --> 08:35.620]  He's got 50 containers that have all been being smoked from through the past six
[08:35.620 --> 08:36.740]  months through a year and a half.
[08:36.940 --> 08:41.300]  Yep. And so most of them have like a quarter gram or a half gram left in them.
[08:41.300 --> 08:44.340]  But at the size dabs you take, I mean, that's plenty of dabs left in there.
[08:44.580 --> 08:46.940]  Right. I haven't had to buy. I mean,
[08:46.980 --> 08:50.100]  I can't even remember the last time I bought hash.
[08:51.460 --> 08:54.740]  It's just, I haven't had extra money to spend on hash.
[08:54.740 --> 08:57.420]  I've been saving up for a handful of different things, including this trip.
[08:57.980 --> 09:01.820]  And so like I've got hash, I don't need to spend money on it. Um,
[09:01.940 --> 09:05.140]  I've been actively trying to get rid of, uh,
[09:06.500 --> 09:08.700]  um, the different containers that I've got.
[09:08.700 --> 09:12.180]  So if one starts getting much lower than the others, I'll focus on it.
[09:12.380 --> 09:15.380]  Just to smoke that one, smoke that one. Try to get it out of the pile. Um,
[09:15.420 --> 09:19.260]  you know, if you need help, bro, I know a guy that takes dabs. I was chuckling.
[09:19.260 --> 09:21.820]  I meant to bring two or three of the different containers over tonight.
[09:21.820 --> 09:23.220]  Then I left them all sitting on my desk.
[09:23.220 --> 09:24.740]  That's all right. You're a sidetrack sometimes.
[09:25.580 --> 09:26.980]  But, uh, I mean,
[09:26.980 --> 09:30.460]  I've actively been going through it and I've still got 40 or 50 containers.
[09:30.500 --> 09:32.060]  Damn. That's impressive. Yeah.
[09:32.100 --> 09:34.900]  I've probably got 10 or 12 different flavors on deck right now. You know,
[09:34.900 --> 09:39.700]  you burn, you've probably got more hash on the table than I've got at home.
[09:40.700 --> 09:43.620]  Um, but I have way more containers.
[09:43.620 --> 09:47.300]  There's about seven to 10 grams of one kind right here and similar on this one.
[09:47.300 --> 09:50.340]  And then I've got six stacks of this apothecary lemon Jeffrey right here.
[09:50.340 --> 09:54.940]  There's more in the bag over here. And this is some, uh, citrus sap shatter.
[09:55.380 --> 10:00.060]  Uh, that's some water hash. And then in here, this is a fun little container.
[10:00.820 --> 10:04.420]  This container, uh, I grabbed some shatter and put shatter in here.
[10:04.460 --> 10:07.260]  And then when it gets low, I just grabbed shatter from another container,
[10:07.300 --> 10:09.220]  whichever this is my little to go container.
[10:09.420 --> 10:11.220]  And this is what I dab on when I'm out and about.
[10:11.220 --> 10:13.140]  If I stop at someone's house or if I have a little break,
[10:13.140 --> 10:16.500]  this is what I dab out of. And everyone's like, Holy shit, I'm so high.
[10:16.500 --> 10:18.940]  What's in there. And I'm like, it's just a mix of shit. Everything.
[10:18.940 --> 10:21.460]  It's everything good for the last year. And it sits in the car.
[10:21.460 --> 10:24.380]  So it all just melts into one little puddle. It's nice and even.
[10:24.380 --> 10:26.660]  It's all congealed together. You don't know what you're getting.
[10:26.660 --> 10:29.060]  It always tastes so good, but that that's,
[10:29.300 --> 10:31.580]  that's my little time bomb right there of dabs.
[10:33.180 --> 10:36.260]  So what I was getting to before we got sidetracked on Mike,
[10:36.260 --> 10:38.100]  having 50 containers,
[10:38.460 --> 10:43.220]  what I was getting to is he smokes a gram of flour and
[10:43.420 --> 10:46.620]  like maybe a half a gram of shatter over a week.
[10:46.940 --> 10:49.780]  The one gram of flour a day and a half a gram of shatter over a week,
[10:49.780 --> 10:53.380]  probably if you put it all together and he's going to go to Mexico for like a
[10:53.380 --> 10:57.420]  week. Yeah. And when you come back, you think it's going to take one dab.
[10:58.060 --> 11:00.940]  Oh, easy. Yeah. One dad, just to make you have to lay on the couch.
[11:00.980 --> 11:01.820]  Feet go numb.
[11:01.820 --> 11:06.020]  Giggle high, like I haven't greened out in two years.
[11:06.220 --> 11:09.180]  The last time I took a tea break, I kind of, I should try that.
[11:09.940 --> 11:13.060]  Do it on vacation. Um, in my experience,
[11:13.060 --> 11:17.380]  the only thing you need to go to in your life to go from daily marijuana
[11:17.380 --> 11:21.980]  consumption to no marijuana consumption for a few days is some interesting shit
[11:21.980 --> 11:23.860]  in your life. Right. Just a break in the rhythm.
[11:24.140 --> 11:27.380]  Last time I went to the warmup half of Mardi Gras,
[11:28.020 --> 11:32.420]  the couple of weeks before actual Mardi Gras with the topless and in the
[11:32.420 --> 11:37.100]  drunkenness is just like family fun drunkenness where it's
[11:37.100 --> 11:39.100]  exactly the same, but everybody keeps their top.
[11:39.140 --> 11:43.100]  Well almost everybody keeps their top on the people that got the memo, right?
[11:43.100 --> 11:44.260]  People that know what's going on.
[11:44.260 --> 11:47.900]  There's always one or two people that clearly showed up in town this morning who
[11:47.900 --> 11:49.220]  are already way too hammered.
[11:49.220 --> 11:51.540]  And one of them keeps trying to take their shirt off while everyone in their
[11:51.540 --> 11:55.900]  group was like, no, it's two weeks from now. Um,
[11:56.140 --> 12:00.580]  but just checking out new Orleans was more than enough to take my mind off.
[12:01.340 --> 12:03.940]  And then you did get some weed and it was super impressive, right?
[12:05.820 --> 12:06.700]  Uh, no,
[12:06.700 --> 12:09.980]  I kept running into people that were offering to sell me weed and it made me
[12:09.980 --> 12:14.420]  laugh because more than one of them was like, dude, my guy gets Colorado.
[12:15.980 --> 12:19.900]  And one of them I'd been chatting with for like 10 minutes while we sat there and
[12:21.260 --> 12:25.740]  smoked a cigarette and he gets me on the phone with his guy.
[12:25.740 --> 12:28.660]  Like that's how far he takes this. He pulls out his cell phone. He's like,
[12:28.660 --> 12:33.460]  let me call my bro. He'll really appreciate the referral. Um, and you,
[12:33.500 --> 12:36.820]  you know, you seem like you, you'd really prefer to be stoned right now.
[12:38.500 --> 12:41.940]  And he calls the guy and he puts, he hands me the phone and he was like, yeah,
[12:41.940 --> 12:44.820]  he just said you're from Colorado. And I go, yeah, I'm,
[12:44.940 --> 12:47.740]  I'm really from Colorado. And the guy on the phone goes,
[12:48.060 --> 12:50.300]  my weed's not from Colorado and just hangs up the phone.
[12:52.660 --> 12:55.620]  He's like, this guy is going to call me out as soon as we try to take his money.
[12:55.620 --> 12:58.460]  He's like, I've done this before. I've hopped on my bike.
[12:58.620 --> 13:01.540]  Cause that's how everybody that was selling weed that I ran into did it down.
[13:01.540 --> 13:06.540]  There was just bike messenger everywhere. Um, I'm not riding my bike 15 blocks.
[13:06.900 --> 13:08.020]  Um, you know,
[13:08.220 --> 13:12.220]  a week before Mardi Gras when everything's nuts and crowded to show up when the
[13:12.220 --> 13:13.980]  guy's going to take one look at it and be like,
[13:13.980 --> 13:15.540]  get this fucking mids out of my face.
[13:15.660 --> 13:17.300]  New Orleans swamp weed away from me.
[13:17.380 --> 13:18.220]  I don't want none of this.
[13:18.220 --> 13:21.580]  The couple of times I ran into people smoking weed out in public,
[13:21.580 --> 13:24.020]  it smelled terrible. Um, we were laughing.
[13:24.020 --> 13:29.020]  My wife's not a cannabis aficionado like I am. Uh, doesn't partake at all.
[13:29.740 --> 13:31.340]  I mean, it hasn't for like 20 years.
[13:31.340 --> 13:34.580]  She can smell me when I show up from a mile away. She's like, God,
[13:34.580 --> 13:39.220]  you reek. And I'm like, yeah, yeah. He's coming over the bridge now.
[13:39.740 --> 13:42.380]  Um, but uh, when we were in new Orleans,
[13:42.380 --> 13:45.180]  she kept leading over and going, even I know that smells bad.
[13:47.180 --> 13:50.580]  Poor lady. Um, that was like nine or 10 days.
[13:51.300 --> 13:53.100]  And so it wasn't that the trip where she got pregnant.
[13:53.380 --> 13:55.900]  No, that's the trip where we found out we were pregnant. Okay.
[13:56.420 --> 14:00.780]  All right. Um, but close. Cool. Reminiscing.
[14:01.220 --> 14:04.300]  Yep. Um, so you have to keep talking.
[14:04.420 --> 14:05.740]  This one's going to be a short break,
[14:05.740 --> 14:07.780]  but my consumption has been lighter this round too.
[14:07.780 --> 14:11.340]  So I'm looking forward to it. Take a tea break every now and again, people.
[14:12.580 --> 14:13.580]  It's good for your brain.
[14:13.940 --> 14:15.740]  I'm going to use what you were talking about into a segue,
[14:15.740 --> 14:18.140]  but I want to finish this dab of lemon Jeffrey before I do it.
[14:18.180 --> 14:21.580]  I'm just hoping you turn at least some colors. Cause that dad was massive.
[14:22.020 --> 14:25.380]  Like I got a good hit just with the extra vapor in the room.
[14:25.420 --> 14:27.940]  I'm kind of a soldier, so it won't be as much, but look,
[14:27.940 --> 14:31.220]  the hair on my arm did move and Mike went to pull the extra leftover smoke.
[14:31.220 --> 14:32.140]  Cause that's so tasty.
[14:32.140 --> 14:35.260]  That's usually like a Mike dab left in the rig when he's done with it.
[14:36.580 --> 14:38.700]  It doesn't make me choke like mad cause it's the heat.
[14:38.740 --> 14:41.140]  It's the hot dab on my smoker lungs.
[14:41.220 --> 14:45.220]  Yeah. You melt that smoker tar back in there. Yep. All right.
[14:45.220 --> 14:47.180]  So I kind of set up something.
[14:47.180 --> 14:49.820]  I got an email from somebody today and you kind of went the right direction to
[14:49.980 --> 14:51.540]  make it a segue. I love it.
[14:52.220 --> 14:55.460]  I'm opening up the email on my phone because my iPhone locks cause I have it on
[14:55.460 --> 14:58.300]  this low battery mode. So it just locks every seven seconds.
[15:00.380 --> 15:02.180]  But this person asked, uh,
[15:02.220 --> 15:04.940]  they said I started listening to your podcast and I'm getting through some of
[15:04.940 --> 15:06.460]  the episodes and loving the info.
[15:06.780 --> 15:11.020]  I've started growing and I'm on my second grow at a boy or girl,
[15:11.660 --> 15:13.980]  a boy because he can sit well, it could be girl.
[15:13.980 --> 15:18.580]  It's 2017 continues to say my wife is a T1 diabetic and started getting a
[15:18.660 --> 15:23.380]  gastro, uh, peresis. I hope I said that correctly. I'm not a doctor. Uh,
[15:23.380 --> 15:26.300]  she has trouble with appetite and Indica's make her hungry, which is great.
[15:26.300 --> 15:30.300]  She's also starting to get anxiety and I know weed is great for that.
[15:31.860 --> 15:33.700]  Uh, the correct weed is good for anxiety.
[15:33.700 --> 15:35.900]  Some weed will give people a panic attack.
[15:36.060 --> 15:39.900]  Your favorite weed will give most people a panic attack, right?
[15:39.980 --> 15:42.860]  You're in luck though. Cause for most folks, uh,
[15:42.860 --> 15:47.180]  what stimulates hunger is also good for the anxiety. So, uh,
[15:47.220 --> 15:49.980]  you're not going to have to hunt real far from what you're already shopping for.
[15:49.980 --> 15:54.580]  Right? It'll be similar. Similar strains will have that effect. Luckily the, uh,
[15:54.620 --> 15:56.580]  the email goes on to say, sorry, I'm coughing after that. Dad,
[15:56.580 --> 16:00.140]  the email goes on to say, can you help me figure out medical type dosing?
[16:00.180 --> 16:03.580]  I know how to get high, but what does medical treatment look like?
[16:03.660 --> 16:07.140]  Small amounts each hour, every two hours, et cetera.
[16:07.500 --> 16:10.740]  He's ends the email with we're in Oregon. So strains here can be different.
[16:10.740 --> 16:14.940]  So knowing characteristics to look for in strains would be very helpful as well.
[16:15.140 --> 16:16.260]  Thank you in advance.
[16:16.740 --> 16:19.380]  I'm not going to say your name on the air because I don't know if you want me to,
[16:20.140 --> 16:24.340]  but it's a dude, it is a boy. So we did verify that by the name. Also,
[16:24.380 --> 16:27.700]  it's 2017. So that name could be a girl's name.
[16:27.700 --> 16:29.660]  I gotta be careful with all this new shit that's happening.
[16:29.700 --> 16:34.220]  I think he, I think he said in the email, but where's he located? Oregon. Okay.
[16:35.260 --> 16:39.060]  Um, and then looking for what does medical dosing look like?
[16:39.060 --> 16:41.820]  What does medical dosing look like? Which explains why you asked me that question.
[16:41.820 --> 16:44.180]  I was like, why do you want to know my consumption rates on the show?
[16:44.180 --> 16:46.540]  But you started talking about taking a consumption break and I was like, well,
[16:46.540 --> 16:48.900]  this will be a smooth segue if my high ass can make it work.
[16:48.900 --> 16:51.100]  No, that was smooth. But, uh, I mean,
[16:51.100 --> 16:54.860]  medical consumption is just, everybody's got to find that fine line.
[16:55.140 --> 16:58.460]  I think is what you're looking for is, uh, that,
[16:58.660 --> 17:03.660]  that space between I've consumed a dose low enough that it's non-intoxicating
[17:05.180 --> 17:10.060]  or it's not, um, reducing the number of things I feel comfortable,
[17:10.620 --> 17:13.740]  um, doing or participating in, in my daily life.
[17:14.300 --> 17:19.020]  And, uh, it's also a large enough dose that it's, uh,
[17:19.060 --> 17:22.060]  treating whatever medical condition you're seeking to treat with that.
[17:22.540 --> 17:27.500]  There may be a threshold, a short time period where you are too high.
[17:28.620 --> 17:32.260]  Uh, you are more high than you'd prefer to be to get the medicine to work
[17:32.260 --> 17:37.220]  medically for you. But over a small period of time, the high will wear off.
[17:37.620 --> 17:41.460]  You'll adjust to the high and the medicine part will still be valuable.
[17:42.060 --> 17:46.740]  Um, I always encourage people to start very, very low. Yes. Um,
[17:46.740 --> 17:51.180]  and slowly work up. Cause I mean, unless you're talking about, um,
[17:51.220 --> 17:55.420]  you've got a cancer diagnosis or something like that. Um,
[17:55.620 --> 17:58.340]  if you're looking to stimulate appetite or,
[17:59.060 --> 18:02.980]  or you some anxiety or help you sleep, um, start off really low,
[18:02.980 --> 18:07.700]  start off with five milligrams, um, you know, two and a half milligrams,
[18:07.740 --> 18:10.940]  seven milligrams, something light. Um,
[18:11.300 --> 18:14.380]  and see how that affects you and slowly build up from there.
[18:14.740 --> 18:16.220]  I talked to a couple of people that were like,
[18:16.220 --> 18:19.340]  I started with a hundred milligrams and it's just too much. Yeah.
[18:19.340 --> 18:22.380]  And it's like, well, duh, like you just told me,
[18:22.380 --> 18:24.140]  you started off with the whole bottle of whiskey.
[18:24.140 --> 18:25.620]  It didn't like what it did to you. Like, well,
[18:25.620 --> 18:30.060]  that's because you didn't do it right. Yeah. So start slow, start nice and slow.
[18:30.740 --> 18:31.580]  Uh, there's a,
[18:31.780 --> 18:35.620]  I don't know where to draw the line between medical dosing and getting high.
[18:35.620 --> 18:37.220]  Because like I said earlier,
[18:37.220 --> 18:41.580]  you may have to smoke until you feel a little head buzz before the pain goes
[18:41.580 --> 18:44.340]  away. But maybe that's part of the medicine also.
[18:44.380 --> 18:48.900]  Maybe that being high is actually part of what helps with the medication because
[18:48.900 --> 18:52.460]  you forget that you've got this condition that makes you anxious.
[18:52.820 --> 18:56.580]  And maybe that mental thing is actually part of the medical treatment for some
[18:56.580 --> 18:57.420]  people.
[18:57.620 --> 18:57.940]  I mean,
[18:57.940 --> 19:02.380]  this is a very individual topic because this is going to be very different for
[19:02.380 --> 19:03.420]  each person. Cause I,
[19:03.420 --> 19:08.420]  I know lots of people that need some of those intoxicating symptoms to start
[19:09.540 --> 19:14.540]  kicking in before the anxiety starts to dissipate before the hunger starts to
[19:15.020 --> 19:18.980]  kick in before the muscle spasticity starts to slow down.
[19:20.140 --> 19:23.180]  And then they just kind of have to chill for a minute and wait for a little bit
[19:23.180 --> 19:26.500]  of that intoxication to pass before they go about whatever else.
[19:26.780 --> 19:29.580]  I've got a, excuse me, I've got a traumatic brain injury.
[19:30.020 --> 19:31.340]  A lot of people that listen to the show,
[19:31.940 --> 19:33.740]  they've been through it with me honestly,
[19:33.740 --> 19:35.260]  if they've listened for the past two years,
[19:35.260 --> 19:35.620]  three years,
[19:35.620 --> 19:37.780]  it happened while you were recording.
[19:37.980 --> 19:39.700]  Like the injury didn't happen on the show,
[19:39.700 --> 19:42.260]  but like this events took place while you were doing it.
[19:42.260 --> 19:43.660]  And I never missed an episode.
[19:43.660 --> 19:46.620]  And there were a couple of episodes where I wasn't even fucking there.
[19:46.660 --> 19:49.620]  I don't remember sitting at this table recording. I don't remember it,
[19:49.900 --> 19:52.460]  but it happened. And I remember listening to those episodes going, wow,
[19:52.460 --> 19:54.660]  I said some dumb shit on those podcasts,
[19:55.180 --> 19:58.660]  but sometimes I have leftover effects from that traumatic brain injury.
[19:58.660 --> 20:00.540]  It'll bother me all day sometimes.
[20:00.900 --> 20:03.300]  And it's just things that you, if you have a brain injury,
[20:03.300 --> 20:05.060]  you know what I'm talking about. I'm not going to go into detail.
[20:05.380 --> 20:08.860]  Sometimes I have to get high to make that go away. There's not a pill.
[20:09.100 --> 20:10.340]  There's not a treatment.
[20:10.340 --> 20:13.740]  There's nothing that works other than me just being high enough to where I don't
[20:13.740 --> 20:17.300]  remember that that's bothering me because I have to get distracted from it,
[20:17.300 --> 20:21.420]  but it's so bothersome. One of them, I can't get, I can't get away.
[20:21.420 --> 20:25.660]  People find the cannabis's ability to help you forget, um,
[20:25.700 --> 20:29.940]  extremely beneficial for a variety of medical conditions. PTSD,
[20:30.540 --> 20:35.460]  nightmares is a big one. But, uh, um, basically folks,
[20:35.460 --> 20:39.220]  if you're not familiar with this particular aspect of cannabis, um,
[20:39.220 --> 20:43.180]  your body has a system in place for helping you forget stuff you don't need to
[20:43.180 --> 20:46.140]  know. And, uh, you don't want to know. Um,
[20:46.180 --> 20:48.260]  like if you think about your last commute to work,
[20:48.620 --> 20:50.500]  like how many blue Chevys did you pass?
[20:51.140 --> 20:53.900]  If anybody knows the answer to that question, like, please go see a doctor.
[20:55.460 --> 20:56.900]  Unless you're a man and then you're okay.
[20:57.140 --> 21:01.060]  Yeah. But your mind isn't supposed to remember that kind of information because
[21:01.060 --> 21:05.980]  it's not helpful or useful. And for most people who aren't rain, man, um,
[21:06.020 --> 21:10.180]  having that sort of I did it. Memory recall, um,
[21:10.220 --> 21:11.260]  is just troublesome.
[21:11.300 --> 21:15.180]  Trying to remember the important events that happened in your day is,
[21:15.220 --> 21:19.540]  is ridiculously difficult if you remember every minute detail. Um,
[21:19.540 --> 21:22.620]  and so basic memory, you just remember the important shit.
[21:23.140 --> 21:26.860]  And cannabis helps that system work a bit more efficiently. Um,
[21:27.580 --> 21:29.980]  I've also heard people describe it as it, uh,
[21:30.540 --> 21:33.020]  there's a number of things your brain takes care of all day.
[21:33.020 --> 21:35.860]  Like you're breathing and you're blinking, um,
[21:35.940 --> 21:39.820]  and you're sweating that you don't have conscious effort, um,
[21:40.020 --> 21:44.500]  or conscious awareness of. And, uh, like your heartbeat, for example,
[21:44.500 --> 21:48.020]  is one, a lot of first time consumers get, they get really baked.
[21:48.060 --> 21:49.020]  They hear their heartbeat.
[21:49.020 --> 21:52.180]  They think they're going to have a heart attack and they get all worked up. Um,
[21:52.220 --> 21:56.100]  you always hear your heartbeat, but your body always hears it.
[21:56.100 --> 21:58.180]  So it tunes it out until you get baked.
[21:58.740 --> 22:03.180]  And then it forgets that it's got that loop on autopilot and people freak.
[22:03.940 --> 22:07.380]  Yeah. I gotta go to the hospital, man. I'm having a heart attack, man.
[22:07.380 --> 22:08.380]  I'm freaking out, man.
[22:08.740 --> 22:12.620]  Um, a friend of mine, a family member, um,
[22:12.660 --> 22:16.900]  we just hit the two year anniversary of them showing up to my house.
[22:17.100 --> 22:20.020]  The first time they dabbed, um,
[22:20.060 --> 22:24.780]  and they were a very light consumer and they took a huge
[22:24.780 --> 22:29.780]  dab. And in their words, like as their face was getting warm and tingly,
[22:30.900 --> 22:34.820]  um, they asked what was in that.
[22:35.500 --> 22:40.380]  I feel weird. And somebody said acid and just not knowing any
[22:40.380 --> 22:42.540]  better. They freaked out.
[22:42.540 --> 22:45.740]  And somebody had to give them a ride home and they were halfway home.
[22:45.740 --> 22:49.140]  And they were like, don't take me home. Take me to Mike's house.
[22:49.300 --> 22:53.260]  Like he'll know what to do. And I was like, have popsicle.
[22:54.980 --> 22:59.540]  It was chat for 20 minutes and, you know, unwind you a little bit, right?
[22:59.660 --> 23:01.300]  That's all it takes. That's all it takes.
[23:01.340 --> 23:03.460]  Some coffee and a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[23:03.460 --> 23:04.900]  Most people will be just fine. Yep.
[23:06.300 --> 23:09.220]  Just go slow folks, especially when you're just starting out.
[23:09.220 --> 23:13.380]  There are a lot of people come into cannabis looking for medical treatments
[23:13.380 --> 23:17.300]  right now. Um, they're not looking to get baked at a concert.
[23:18.100 --> 23:22.260]  And so the introduction to the world is very different than it was for a lot of
[23:22.700 --> 23:24.460]  us. Right. But they, this, uh,
[23:24.500 --> 23:26.900]  they seem like they have been smoking because she, uh,
[23:26.940 --> 23:29.260]  they say she has trouble with appetite and because make her hungry.
[23:29.260 --> 23:31.220]  So they know the difference between Indica and sativa.
[23:31.220 --> 23:33.500]  And they know that she can smoke to get hungry. Uh,
[23:33.540 --> 23:35.500]  they also say that she's starting to get anxiety,
[23:35.780 --> 23:38.260]  that they know weed is good for. So they seem like they know what they're doing.
[23:38.580 --> 23:41.940]  Their main question, it feels like was what does medical treatment look like?
[23:41.940 --> 23:44.900]  Small amounts each hour, every two hours, et cetera.
[23:45.260 --> 23:49.740]  Now that honestly is one of my favorite parts about medical cannabis is that I
[23:49.740 --> 23:53.700]  get to decide what works best for me. They don't give, when you go to the doctor,
[23:53.700 --> 23:56.820]  even if the doctor gives you a prescription for whatever pill you take,
[23:56.820 --> 24:00.460]  I don't take any pharmaceuticals. I just don't, uh, whatever pill they give you,
[24:00.700 --> 24:01.700]  they put a number on there.
[24:01.740 --> 24:05.500]  How many you take every hour and maybe that fucks you up and makes you goofy.
[24:05.500 --> 24:09.580]  Maybe that doesn't take the pain away. So there's, Oh, well,
[24:09.660 --> 24:11.500]  you get 30 pills are going to last you a month.
[24:11.540 --> 24:13.220]  That's what you have to do with cannabis.
[24:13.900 --> 24:17.180]  Maybe you can take a puff this big and it takes your pain away.
[24:17.180 --> 24:20.860]  Maybe you got to take 17 dabs to get to the position you need to be in.
[24:21.260 --> 24:24.580]  My favorite part about cannabis is that I can grow my own or I can go to the
[24:24.580 --> 24:26.580]  dispensary. It sounds like these folks are growing their own,
[24:27.300 --> 24:32.300]  but my favorite part is that I can control my own consumption for the needs that
[24:32.460 --> 24:35.260]  I need it. Maybe on some days I don't need it as much on some days.
[24:35.260 --> 24:37.340]  I need it a lot more when it's cold. My body hurts.
[24:37.660 --> 24:39.620]  If I worked for 12 hours a day in the garden,
[24:39.620 --> 24:42.620]  my knees feel blown out and I need to take extra dabs at the end of the day.
[24:43.140 --> 24:46.580]  Like they just, my favorite part is being able to decide my medicine.
[24:46.580 --> 24:50.820]  So my guidance on that part is what works best for you is what's got to work.
[24:50.820 --> 24:54.660]  If you're smoking, smoke light and then play a little game,
[24:54.700 --> 24:56.900]  take a Saturday and maybe pass your threshold.
[24:56.900 --> 24:59.580]  When you know you're perfectly medicated, smoke a little extra,
[24:59.860 --> 25:02.620]  see if it medicates you better. Or if you get too high and it's uncomfortable,
[25:02.620 --> 25:04.180]  it's only going to last a little bit. You'll be just fine.
[25:04.460 --> 25:07.660]  But you need to find that window. You need to find where you are.
[25:07.940 --> 25:09.340]  You got to experiment with that a little bit.
[25:09.340 --> 25:11.140]  And each train is going to treat you a little differently.
[25:11.340 --> 25:13.860]  So be prepared for some adjustments and some different stuff,
[25:13.860 --> 25:15.020]  some new things if you're new.
[25:16.020 --> 25:17.940]  Yeah. Especially when you first started,
[25:17.940 --> 25:19.860]  every time you bring a different strain,
[25:20.060 --> 25:24.620]  especially if you're shopping in a rec store or retail store or black market on
[25:24.620 --> 25:27.860]  the black market, when you first get that, that fresh bag of pot home,
[25:27.860 --> 25:32.580]  especially when you're a new consumer, go easy.
[25:35.380 --> 25:40.380]  It's potency can vary widely even when it basically looks the same.
[25:40.700 --> 25:43.900]  So just go easy and you should be,
[25:44.020 --> 25:47.740]  should be able to find that window that's going to work well for you without too
[25:47.740 --> 25:48.580]  much hunting.
[25:48.740 --> 25:52.140]  Right. If you're eating edibles, do five milligrams, then do 10.
[25:52.740 --> 25:56.220]  Then the next day do 20 and find your zone. And if 25 is too much,
[25:56.220 --> 25:58.540]  do 20 from now on until it quits working.
[25:58.540 --> 26:00.340]  Cause you're going to have to increase just a little bit.
[26:00.340 --> 26:02.140]  Once the head buzz starts wearing off.
[26:02.140 --> 26:04.860]  Also you'll be able to increase the dosage without getting so high.
[26:05.260 --> 26:07.180]  The last part of the question says we're in Oregon.
[26:07.180 --> 26:08.620]  So strains here can be different.
[26:08.620 --> 26:11.980]  So knowing characteristics to look for in strains would be very helpful as
[26:11.980 --> 26:16.180]  well. Not exactly sure what you mean by that characteristics to look for in
[26:16.180 --> 26:21.180]  strains. Indica stuff. It sounds like it's probably best things with high CBD.
[26:21.460 --> 26:25.540]  If you have lab testing available maybe LA confidential.
[26:26.100 --> 26:28.020]  Jilly bean is a sativa dominant strain,
[26:28.020 --> 26:30.500]  but it's really mellow and puts a smile on my face.
[26:31.140 --> 26:35.220]  And it didn't seem to make me overwhelmingly high. Here's something funny.
[26:35.220 --> 26:38.220]  Kevin and I were talking, uh, hung out with you guys, Kev bro from, uh,
[26:38.260 --> 26:40.100]  elevated concentrations. It used to be on the show.
[26:40.100 --> 26:41.940]  That's on some of the older episodes he was over the other day.
[26:41.940 --> 26:44.740]  We're taking some dabs and we're talking about old strains. We used to smoke.
[26:45.700 --> 26:50.340]  Deadhead OG used to make us have to take a shit. There was a deadhead OG clone.
[26:50.340 --> 26:53.060]  It was deadhead OG number two that every time somebody would smoke it,
[26:53.420 --> 26:55.540]  they'd be like, bro, I gotta go. And he'd be like, why? You got a shit?
[26:55.540 --> 26:56.740]  And they'd be like, yeah, how could you tell?
[26:56.740 --> 26:58.500]  Like cause that weed makes everyone have to shit.
[26:58.900 --> 27:03.460]  So there's some phenotypes of deadhead OG that'll may be good for your gastro
[27:03.460 --> 27:06.500]  intestinal system. Cause every time I smoked it, I had to poo.
[27:07.100 --> 27:09.540]  That one's on the chart. Yeah. If you can find that one,
[27:10.260 --> 27:13.460]  it's all going to be about what's available in your area and what works, uh,
[27:13.860 --> 27:18.100]  specifically for your wife's, uh, physical, uh,
[27:18.100 --> 27:20.500]  makeup because cannabis is going to react differently to everybody.
[27:20.500 --> 27:23.020]  I hope that question was about selecting strains for her.
[27:23.380 --> 27:26.260]  If it's about selecting strains to grow an organ, uh,
[27:26.260 --> 27:29.460]  I don't know if you're indoors or outdoors and I'm really not sure what to
[27:29.460 --> 27:34.180]  recommend for you. If you want to email me back and clarify that, you know,
[27:34.180 --> 27:35.020]  I'll answer it for you.
[27:35.100 --> 27:39.420]  Sorry that our best advice is just experiment slowly. Um,
[27:39.460 --> 27:41.580]  but unfortunately that's where we're stuck.
[27:41.700 --> 27:44.420]  That's the point we're at right now with cannabis. Uh,
[27:44.500 --> 27:48.180]  it's a really good question, but the thing about it is you just gotta,
[27:48.180 --> 27:50.380]  it's like, how do I know how hard of a punch I can take?
[27:50.380 --> 27:51.220]  I get punched in the face.
[27:51.220 --> 27:54.020]  I had this conversation a lot when I was working a sales counter.
[27:54.020 --> 27:58.500]  I ran into a lot of people who, I mean, their story was basically my doctor.
[27:58.980 --> 28:03.220]  I kind of ran out of options and somebody in my medical team was like,
[28:03.220 --> 28:07.660]  why don't you go try this? And so I drove over here, help.
[28:07.940 --> 28:10.220]  Yeah. And I mean, that,
[28:10.380 --> 28:14.260]  that was my job was taking those people in kind of showing them the whole
[28:14.740 --> 28:15.180]  everything.
[28:15.180 --> 28:19.180]  And that's what sucks about the new, a lot of the newer, I say new,
[28:19.180 --> 28:21.780]  but the new system back when Mike and I were in this,
[28:21.940 --> 28:24.580]  you could come to our dispensary and if you weren't sure what strain you wanted,
[28:24.580 --> 28:28.020]  we let you smoke both of them and then you could decide what strain you wanted
[28:28.300 --> 28:30.740]  by miss the vaporizer under the counter. That was really,
[28:30.780 --> 28:32.980]  I had pre-rolled joints of everything.
[28:32.980 --> 28:35.780]  I had my favorite pipe on the counter when we were running metamor.
[28:35.780 --> 28:38.500]  I had a bong up there. We used to, before we got super busy,
[28:38.500 --> 28:40.260]  I was having a lot of fun smoking with everybody.
[28:40.260 --> 28:42.940]  They'd come just to buy an eighth and smoke it with me. It was so much fun,
[28:43.460 --> 28:47.900]  but we'd be able to smoke there. And now when you go to a medical shop,
[28:47.900 --> 28:51.620]  it's buy and leave. It's pretty much shut up by leap is how it feels in these
[28:51.620 --> 28:54.540]  medical facilities. If we could consume,
[28:54.540 --> 28:57.940]  if we had a little room in the back where a trained professional like Mike or
[28:57.940 --> 29:01.340]  myself, or there's a lot of others that could help us,
[29:01.660 --> 29:04.420]  they could hang out and we could have somebody that could help children and
[29:04.420 --> 29:07.860]  they could help tell them like, Oh, you've got this condition.
[29:08.140 --> 29:11.500]  We've seen these results from this product,
[29:11.500 --> 29:13.940]  or this is the best way to do that. Or you and I can be like, Oh,
[29:13.940 --> 29:15.540]  you never smoked weed. Here's a bowl.
[29:15.820 --> 29:17.340]  Here's a fucking peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
[29:17.340 --> 29:19.460]  Here's an X-Box or whatever you're into.
[29:19.460 --> 29:22.100]  There's a place to plug in your iPhone. Here's a comfy safe spot.
[29:22.540 --> 29:24.580]  Take your first rip off of this weed. We'll show you how to do it.
[29:24.700 --> 29:26.860]  Don't inhale no more. Stop, stop. You're done. You're going to be too high.
[29:27.140 --> 29:27.540]  You know what I mean?
[29:27.540 --> 29:30.100]  Cause sometimes some people don't know and they'll just get that pipe and
[29:31.820 --> 29:34.860]  and you're like, Oh, that was your first hit of weed ever. Oh man.
[29:34.900 --> 29:37.100]  We're gonna have to call your mom. You just got to tell them,
[29:37.100 --> 29:40.580]  just take a little puff. There you go. Easy. Yeah. The first time,
[29:40.580 --> 29:43.900]  that's all you need. Second time, do two of those. Third time, do three of them.
[29:44.140 --> 29:46.140]  Well, see what, see where your threshold is.
[29:46.380 --> 29:50.380]  For a lot of people walking into this now, smoking is not your only option.
[29:51.340 --> 29:55.100]  I'm like, I'm, I'm sure Oregon's not far behind Colorado with this,
[29:55.420 --> 29:56.740]  but like we have pills now.
[29:57.220 --> 29:57.780]  Yes, we do.
[29:57.780 --> 30:00.940]  Just go to the store and get a five milligram THC pill.
[30:01.540 --> 30:05.380]  And so you know exactly what milligram you're taking,
[30:05.380 --> 30:08.340]  how often you're taking it and you start, I mean,
[30:08.380 --> 30:12.780]  you're still stuck experimenting and kind of figuring out how many milligrams,
[30:12.780 --> 30:14.980]  how often work best for your condition.
[30:14.980 --> 30:19.060]  But it's a little easier to dose that way instead of like, well,
[30:19.060 --> 30:23.180]  I take two hits of the sour diesel and I take one and a half hits of the flow
[30:23.300 --> 30:24.140]  or.
[30:24.900 --> 30:27.620]  And once you're into it for a little while, you'll find your rhythm.
[30:27.660 --> 30:31.220]  It becomes fun. It becomes your little ritual and it's part of your thing.
[30:31.420 --> 30:33.940]  And that's part of being able to control your own medicine.
[30:33.940 --> 30:37.980]  I feel like I've got my little tab set. Everyone's got their stuff differently.
[30:37.980 --> 30:39.620]  You carry your products differently.
[30:39.620 --> 30:42.500]  Everyone's got their little pipe carrier and the little setup at home.
[30:42.860 --> 30:44.780]  It'll become part of your thing. It'll be really fun.
[30:45.340 --> 30:49.020]  Please do not start your cannabis career with dabs.
[30:49.180 --> 30:52.580]  Don't don't make your introduction to cannabis a dab. It'll piss you off.
[30:52.580 --> 30:54.820]  You won't like cannabis. You'll hate it. You'll be way too high.
[30:54.860 --> 30:56.020]  There's no reason to go.
[30:56.100 --> 31:00.900]  It's like starting off your relationship with booze, with moonshine.
[31:01.140 --> 31:01.980]  Like just don't do it.
[31:03.380 --> 31:06.500]  Go to the dispensary, hit up your cool nephew, whatever you got to do,
[31:06.620 --> 31:09.700]  wherever you are, you know how to do it. Get some decent weed.
[31:09.740 --> 31:10.580]  Hopefully it's safe.
[31:10.580 --> 31:12.900]  Hopefully we're not even going to make people paranoid about that.
[31:12.940 --> 31:15.900]  You get some quality weed, smoke it gently,
[31:17.100 --> 31:19.700]  watch some ESPN, watch some golden girls, whatever you're going to do.
[31:20.300 --> 31:22.340]  Hopefully it treats you all right. And then smoke a little more next time.
[31:22.420 --> 31:25.140]  And then smoke one of these days, just smoke until you hit that threshold.
[31:25.140 --> 31:26.820]  That's what I want to see. All right.
[31:26.820 --> 31:30.820]  So our emailer also said that they were on their second garden now.
[31:31.580 --> 31:33.180]  I hope, Oh, excuse me.
[31:34.220 --> 31:37.780]  I hope that you send me some questions about that garden so that we can help you
[31:37.900 --> 31:40.700]  improve that a little bit. I completely appreciate the email.
[31:41.060 --> 31:45.620]  I hope that we taught your wife a little bit about dosing and I hope that things
[31:45.620 --> 31:46.820]  get better for the whole family.
[31:48.100 --> 31:48.940]  Ditto.
[31:49.300 --> 31:50.740]  Ditto. Yes. All right.
[31:50.940 --> 31:53.540]  So, uh, on the last we've done so many episodes,
[31:53.540 --> 31:56.820]  I think it was two episodes ago, three episodes ago, uh,
[31:56.820 --> 32:00.220]  we talked about some rules that were coming down the pipe in Colorado.
[32:00.620 --> 32:02.740]  Some of those have been changed and adjusted.
[32:03.020 --> 32:05.420]  SB 1220 took another step forward.
[32:05.940 --> 32:09.180]  Does that mean it's getting closer to actually happening? Yep. I'm scared.
[32:09.940 --> 32:10.540]  It should be.
[32:10.540 --> 32:14.660]  It's going to change a lot of things for a lot of people in Colorado. Yep. Um,
[32:15.380 --> 32:17.860]  and it's not going to do anything they think it's going to do.
[32:17.860 --> 32:18.020]  No,
[32:18.020 --> 32:21.180]  it's only going to make it harder for medical patients to get access to safe
[32:21.220 --> 32:25.700]  quality cannabis. Like they need. Yep. We, uh, we gave you a good rundown last time,
[32:25.700 --> 32:29.740]  but just for anybody who's not familiar, um,
[32:30.020 --> 32:34.900]  SB 1220 is this year's version of a Colorado's caregiver
[32:34.900 --> 32:38.940]  crackdown. Um, Colorado right now,
[32:39.500 --> 32:43.900]  the press keeps saying the rule is 99 plants, right? Which is inaccurate.
[32:44.220 --> 32:46.180]  I've wanted to address that. I was going to read an article,
[32:46.300 --> 32:49.460]  but with the both of us here, we don't even need to read an article. Um,
[32:49.820 --> 32:51.140]  let's start with what the rules were.
[32:52.180 --> 32:55.260]  Yeah, that's, that's kind of where I was going with this right now in Colorado.
[32:55.780 --> 33:00.940]  You can, uh, you can grow as six plants is just any
[33:00.940 --> 33:02.260]  adult. If you're a recreation,
[33:03.020 --> 33:06.180]  private residence, six plants in my house. No problem.
[33:06.500 --> 33:11.220]  No problem. If it's you and a spouse, um,
[33:11.260 --> 33:15.660]  or you and another adult over 21, 12 plants, no problem. You just double it.
[33:15.780 --> 33:19.260]  Okay. Um, and in Colorado, all of these numbers,
[33:19.300 --> 33:23.420]  you cut in half and you can have half and flower and half, not in flower. Okay.
[33:23.420 --> 33:26.540]  Now, is there a limit to how many people live in my house? Uh,
[33:26.580 --> 33:30.940]  that depends on where you live. A lot of places like Denver, um,
[33:31.780 --> 33:36.460]  several municipalities now have passed their own little local rules saying
[33:36.820 --> 33:41.420]  you can only have 12, you can only have 16, you can only have 18 per residence,
[33:41.540 --> 33:46.300]  okay. Which already sets up this kind of confusing loophole where you and your
[33:46.300 --> 33:50.580]  roommates have a meeting where you decide who gets to exercise their
[33:50.580 --> 33:53.900]  constitutional rights and who doesn't. Um,
[33:54.100 --> 33:55.940]  and because these are new laws,
[33:55.980 --> 34:00.940]  like these are just bizarre events that take place in Colorado now. Um,
[34:01.460 --> 34:04.900]  and those are just the recreational rules. Okay. Now medical,
[34:04.900 --> 34:08.940]  which is what SB 1220 is targeting. Um,
[34:08.980 --> 34:10.540]  it applies to rec as well,
[34:10.540 --> 34:14.420]  but it just enforces that the plant caps statewide instead of letting it be
[34:14.420 --> 34:19.260]  local. Um, medically in Colorado, you can grow as,
[34:19.900 --> 34:23.780]  uh, your standard medical marijuana count is six plants. Um,
[34:23.820 --> 34:28.660]  but depending on what your doctor thinks is medically appropriate,
[34:29.140 --> 34:30.620]  your card, uh,
[34:30.660 --> 34:35.380]  might save 20 plants or 50 plants or 150 plants.
[34:35.460 --> 34:38.860]  And that's where the media is getting confused and saying the limit was 99.
[34:38.860 --> 34:41.420]  Some doctors would recommend 99 plants.
[34:41.620 --> 34:43.460]  They were kind of pushing the limits doing that.
[34:43.460 --> 34:46.060]  That was only if that doctor felt like it was appropriate.
[34:46.300 --> 34:49.540]  There was never anything spoken of about it legally. Uh,
[34:49.540 --> 34:51.140]  there was kind of a gray area there.
[34:51.420 --> 34:55.420]  The medical rules in Colorado have been around since the year 2000.
[34:55.460 --> 34:59.820]  So we're going on 17 years that these rules have been in play now.
[35:00.420 --> 35:04.140]  Um, and they've never been officially amended.
[35:04.140 --> 35:06.580]  They've just been amended in practice.
[35:07.100 --> 35:11.020]  And that's where the 99 plant count comes from is, uh,
[35:11.060 --> 35:15.740]  the federal government uses 99 plants is their cutoff limit for your
[35:15.740 --> 35:19.780]  interesting. If you have 99 plants, you are not interesting.
[35:20.260 --> 35:22.940]  If you have a hundred plants, Holy shit. Wow. Look at you.
[35:22.940 --> 35:24.180]  You're very interesting.
[35:24.500 --> 35:28.460]  The federal government is very interested in what you're doing now. Um,
[35:28.460 --> 35:30.620]  and so in practice in Colorado,
[35:30.980 --> 35:35.860]  the cutoff limit for the biggest medical marijuana plant count cards
[35:35.860 --> 35:40.420]  sort of became 99 over time. I remember 500 count cards. Um,
[35:40.420 --> 35:43.700]  I remember when an acquaintance of ours had six,
[35:44.260 --> 35:49.580]  500 plant counts assigned to his, um, his name as a caregiver. Um,
[35:49.620 --> 35:53.260]  they couldn't grow anywhere near that amount. It was stupid. Um,
[35:53.300 --> 35:56.300]  they just didn't have the time, the space, the energy, the money, but they,
[35:56.420 --> 36:01.100]  they racked up that plant count. Um, and basically every year,
[36:01.540 --> 36:05.580]  the rules and practice for this get a little tighter. Um,
[36:05.700 --> 36:10.460]  as the state takes a swing at attempting to officially change the rules in this
[36:10.460 --> 36:13.620]  year, it looks like their official rule change might actually make it through.
[36:14.420 --> 36:15.260]  Um,
[36:16.500 --> 36:20.900]  this week they decided to tweak the rules that are being proposed.
[36:21.500 --> 36:22.340]  Um,
[36:22.340 --> 36:27.260]  everybody with a medical marijuana card or any caregiver could grow up to 12
[36:27.260 --> 36:28.500]  plants per residence.
[36:28.620 --> 36:30.940]  12 plants per residence is their proposed cap.
[36:30.980 --> 36:35.540]  That's the, that's the automatic default limit is 12 plants per residence.
[36:35.540 --> 36:37.540]  In Colorado. Um,
[36:37.580 --> 36:40.900]  and if you're a medical marijuana patient,
[36:40.940 --> 36:43.860]  whose medical marijuana card, uh,
[36:43.900 --> 36:46.060]  says they need more plants than 12,
[36:46.740 --> 36:49.620]  or if you've got multiple people living in a single home,
[36:49.620 --> 36:54.300]  or if you're a caregiver with more plants and patients assigned to you to add up
[36:54.300 --> 36:58.260]  to more than 12, you can go to the state and local government.
[36:58.260 --> 36:59.820]  So like you're in the city of Pueblo,
[36:59.820 --> 37:02.780]  you would go to the city of Pueblo and the state of Colorado.
[37:03.420 --> 37:08.340]  And I'm not sure if it's asked for permission or just let them know
[37:08.620 --> 37:12.420]  and sign up. And then you could do 24 plants.
[37:12.620 --> 37:17.340]  All right. So 12 with just a, um, medical marijuana, recreate, uh,
[37:17.380 --> 37:21.220]  recommendation or with an optional, uh, extended plant count,
[37:22.700 --> 37:25.420]  or you have to go register for 24.
[37:25.420 --> 37:27.860]  And then you also have to have the extended plant count to go with that.
[37:27.940 --> 37:31.140]  Yep. You would still need all your paperwork to cover your plant count.
[37:31.580 --> 37:33.940]  Probably have to take that with you when you go to register.
[37:34.420 --> 37:38.580]  Uh, yep. Uh, I'm sure that if these rules pass,
[37:38.580 --> 37:43.220]  when they pass, there will be an official process to go through. Um,
[37:43.460 --> 37:46.700]  the really interesting stuff with what happened with this bill this week is the
[37:46.700 --> 37:50.260]  stuff that isn't really in the press. Um,
[37:51.460 --> 37:52.700]  for stuff like this,
[37:52.700 --> 37:56.740]  when it gets a hearing in front of the house or the Senator in this, uh,
[37:56.780 --> 37:58.540]  this case, I think it was a Senate, uh,
[37:58.580 --> 38:01.940]  subcommittee that voted on it this week.
[38:02.540 --> 38:05.380]  There has to be a public announcement that they're holding the hearing.
[38:05.740 --> 38:07.380]  And then for stuff like this,
[38:07.420 --> 38:12.420]  it ends up with like hours and hours and hours of redundant testimony is
[38:12.420 --> 38:16.660]  patient after patient get up and say, you know, this is going to be bad for me.
[38:16.660 --> 38:19.820]  This is going to make it much harder to get my medicine. Um,
[38:19.820 --> 38:20.900]  and for stuff like this,
[38:20.900 --> 38:24.220]  this will kill me because I'm too poor to have a shop in the stores to buy what
[38:24.260 --> 38:26.260]  I need to make it home. Right. Um,
[38:26.300 --> 38:29.980]  and for the people doing stuff like Phoenix tears and RSO, uh,
[38:30.020 --> 38:33.860]  you can't afford to buy a pound of recreational marijuana and turn it into
[38:33.860 --> 38:35.420]  medicine. Right. Um,
[38:35.420 --> 38:40.420]  unless you're what was on that, like you can't trust that to turn that into RSO.
[38:40.900 --> 38:42.940]  If I don't know where the product came from,
[38:42.940 --> 38:47.820]  I have no comfort turning it into an oil to use as a cancer fighting agent.
[38:47.900 --> 38:51.540]  And when you just think of, so you're a wreck, uh,
[38:51.660 --> 38:56.340]  a medical marijuana patient. You can buy two ounces at a time. Um,
[38:56.380 --> 38:59.620]  you go to a med shop, um,
[39:00.140 --> 39:04.540]  and buy two ounces, go home, come back the next day, buy two ounces.
[39:04.540 --> 39:06.500]  You do that eight times. Now you've got your pound.
[39:07.660 --> 39:12.380]  Like already it's taking you eight days just to inquire,
[39:12.620 --> 39:15.980]  right. Your base ingredients for your, your meds for this month.
[39:16.500 --> 39:20.100]  Like when your caregiver will show up with it already processed for you,
[39:20.100 --> 39:23.660]  right. They bring it right to you or you go pick it up from them,
[39:23.660 --> 39:25.300]  depending on how you've got it arranged.
[39:25.660 --> 39:26.940]  Depends on if you're homebound or not.
[39:28.340 --> 39:32.980]  So I mean, these, these have serious implications for, for people,
[39:33.380 --> 39:36.780]  people's lives and livelihood and health in Colorado. Um,
[39:36.780 --> 39:39.380]  and so a lot of people tend to show up to these hearings.
[39:39.740 --> 39:43.380]  So this week's hearing came out of nowhere. Um,
[39:43.420 --> 39:47.100]  and then when it started, it was clear that, um,
[39:47.140 --> 39:50.340]  the crowd that's typically there wasn't there because the hearing came out of
[39:50.340 --> 39:53.460]  nowhere and no one was expecting it to happen. Um,
[39:53.500 --> 39:57.420]  and then the bill had several amendments that no one had heard.
[39:57.580 --> 39:58.660]  No one knew what it was.
[39:59.020 --> 40:02.660]  The bill was going to do until after it was voted on, uh,
[40:02.700 --> 40:07.340]  or after public testimony was over, then the amendments get discussed.
[40:07.820 --> 40:12.660]  And so, um, the first time 1220 went up for hearing,
[40:12.980 --> 40:16.060]  testimony was nine at public testimony was nine hours.
[40:17.620 --> 40:21.220]  Um, this week, when it went up for hearing, it was like an hour and 40.
[40:22.900 --> 40:27.460]  Um, and that missing seven hours and change is the people who didn't have enough
[40:27.460 --> 40:30.180]  time and notice to get to the hearing. Um,
[40:30.220 --> 40:35.100]  and then come the end of public testimony, we hear these amendments. Um,
[40:35.100 --> 40:36.420]  and that's where the plant camp,
[40:36.860 --> 40:41.780]  plant plant cap changed from 16 statewide as a default
[40:42.220 --> 40:45.140]  back down to 12 with, uh,
[40:45.220 --> 40:47.500]  you can register with the state and County.
[40:47.620 --> 40:49.180]  They found a way to charge us some money.
[40:49.220 --> 40:52.860]  They're going to charge you a small fee for that 24. I guarantee you.
[40:53.100 --> 40:55.540]  Well, it looks like, um,
[40:55.780 --> 41:00.180]  a couple of groups got together with the governor's office over the weekend and
[41:00.180 --> 41:04.900]  came up, like hammered out some compromise amendments to make,
[41:05.540 --> 41:08.580]  um, a couple of different, um,
[41:08.980 --> 41:13.420]  organizations that are typically on our side of this conversation, um,
[41:13.580 --> 41:16.780]  finally turn around and support the bill. Um,
[41:16.820 --> 41:21.820]  I heard a number of different groups that had words like patient caregiver in
[41:22.180 --> 41:24.100]  the name of their little organization.
[41:24.100 --> 41:25.180]  Did they have Alliance in there?
[41:25.340 --> 41:28.660]  Yep. Um, or, um,
[41:29.460 --> 41:33.500]  maybe worked out to an acronym that might be familiar with that or Russian
[41:33.500 --> 41:34.340]  pilots.
[41:35.140 --> 41:35.980]  Staying out of it.
[41:36.220 --> 41:37.460]  I've gotten close enough.
[41:37.740 --> 41:42.460]  I was shocked at the number of supporters that had flipped from last week to this
[41:42.500 --> 41:46.780]  week with saying, you know, with these amendments, we can support this bill.
[41:47.260 --> 41:52.260]  Um, last week we were dead set against it this week. We're okay with it. Um,
[41:52.940 --> 41:57.940]  no one really knows what all happened behind those closed doors to get all of
[41:58.140 --> 42:01.900]  these groups on board, but it seems shady shit to me. Of course. Um,
[42:02.180 --> 42:06.260]  Kirsten, why I thought money right away. Um, she's an ape, uh,
[42:06.260 --> 42:09.620]  associated press reporter, follow her Twitter. Um,
[42:09.740 --> 42:14.260]  if you want an easy way to find it, go to my Twitter and look for retweets. Um,
[42:14.300 --> 42:16.140]  at Nemo punk 15 on Twitter, check them out.
[42:16.140 --> 42:19.020]  You guys, she is all over the Colorado legislature.
[42:19.020 --> 42:21.260]  I think she writes for the cannabis occasionally. Um,
[42:21.300 --> 42:24.780]  they use a lot of her stuff, but, uh, she works for the associated press.
[42:25.060 --> 42:28.140]  The cannabis syndicates or stuff. Good deal. Um,
[42:29.060 --> 42:31.220]  she knows the cannabis beat for sure.
[42:31.220 --> 42:35.300]  And she does some great reporting and her Colorado legislature reporting on this
[42:35.300 --> 42:37.380]  has been phenomenal. Um,
[42:37.420 --> 42:40.900]  her Twitter feeds been the highlight of my week, uh, two weeks in a row now.
[42:40.940 --> 42:42.660]  So check it out people.
[42:43.020 --> 42:44.300]  So if this happens, uh,
[42:44.300 --> 42:48.580]  all it's going to really do in my opinion is make medical users have to go to
[42:48.580 --> 42:51.340]  dispensaries and pay dispensary taxes.
[42:51.660 --> 42:52.620]  That's I mean,
[42:52.620 --> 42:57.300]  that's the real goal behind the bill is to get rid of caregivers. Um,
[42:58.980 --> 43:01.740]  during public testimony, the people who are supporting it,
[43:01.740 --> 43:03.900]  the people who put this forward, um,
[43:03.940 --> 43:07.260]  they're saying it's going to get rid of home grows, cartels,
[43:07.780 --> 43:09.300]  home grows being robbed.
[43:09.340 --> 43:12.460]  That's the same way that saying making guns illegal, we'll get rid of guns.
[43:12.860 --> 43:13.860]  This is even dumber.
[43:14.660 --> 43:18.140]  Sort of. Yeah. Yeah. Um, cause the, I mean,
[43:18.140 --> 43:22.860]  most gun owners are law abiding citizens. Right. And if you make guns illegal,
[43:22.860 --> 43:25.980]  bad guys are still going to have guns because they're bad guys.
[43:26.060 --> 43:30.060]  The people that they're targeting in this bill are the people that are growing
[43:30.060 --> 43:33.180]  large amounts of marijuana and sending it out of state.
[43:33.980 --> 43:35.060]  Caregivers aren't doing that.
[43:35.140 --> 43:36.340]  No, I've got patients that would,
[43:36.420 --> 43:39.820]  you would murder me if I grew cannabis and it went anywhere but to your lungs.
[43:40.380 --> 43:43.780]  There's not enough. You follow the rules.
[43:43.900 --> 43:46.620]  And so with the rules as they already are,
[43:46.700 --> 43:50.220]  I smoke so much of what I grow. Yep. Like you get my leftovers basically.
[43:51.620 --> 43:55.820]  Um, repeatedly during the testimony, people brought up, um,
[43:55.820 --> 44:00.060]  the caregiver registry was only became mandatory January 1st.
[44:00.860 --> 44:03.140]  All of the new doctor, um,
[44:03.260 --> 44:06.580]  rules and regs came down the pipe in October.
[44:07.300 --> 44:09.380]  And so those are just now taking effect.
[44:09.700 --> 44:13.020]  All the extended plant count stuff that we've already covered here in Colorado,
[44:13.020 --> 44:14.020]  all of that's gone.
[44:14.340 --> 44:17.420]  It doesn't matter how many plants I'm totally legally allowed to grow in
[44:17.440 --> 44:19.340]  Colorado. Um,
[44:19.500 --> 44:24.340]  unless your doctor is willing to risk their medical license and go to court to
[44:24.340 --> 44:28.020]  testify that you need more than six plants to treat your condition,
[44:28.300 --> 44:32.700]  you ain't getting more than six. And so the people who have, uh,
[44:33.300 --> 44:36.380]  are allegedly being targeted by this bill, um,
[44:36.420 --> 44:39.900]  are the people who are scamming the medical marijuana doctors to get extended
[44:39.900 --> 44:41.500]  plant counts. They're,
[44:42.180 --> 44:45.660]  it's a scam because those patients don't need anywhere near that level of
[44:45.660 --> 44:49.420]  medicine so that there's a plenty of excess to send to Arkansas or wherever
[44:49.420 --> 44:50.260]  they're shipping it.
[44:50.300 --> 44:51.140]  East coast, bro.
[44:52.060 --> 44:57.060]  And these, they, they're not following federal trafficking rules.
[44:57.260 --> 44:59.060]  They're not following state medical rules.
[44:59.060 --> 45:01.780]  They're not following building code rules. I mean,
[45:01.940 --> 45:05.300]  they aren't interested in anything other than the profit and they think they're
[45:05.320 --> 45:06.660]  going to get rid of them with a plant cap.
[45:07.580 --> 45:12.300]  Like we've been trying to get rid of illegal home grows our entire
[45:12.300 --> 45:13.340]  adult lives, bro.
[45:13.820 --> 45:17.820]  Like the first time I remember growing my neighborhood, getting busted,
[45:17.820 --> 45:21.900]  I was like seven or eight and it was a dude I knew cause he was friends with
[45:21.900 --> 45:23.700]  someone. My dad went hunting with occasionally.
[45:23.780 --> 45:26.860]  I lived in California when I was a little tiny kid and everybody grew,
[45:26.860 --> 45:27.700]  we'd where I lived.
[45:27.740 --> 45:30.700]  I lived in a bike kind of on the coast and then kind of the hood.
[45:31.140 --> 45:34.420]  Everybody grew weed. That's what all the white people did.
[45:34.460 --> 45:36.380]  When we were kids,
[45:36.540 --> 45:40.780]  the marijuana market in the U S was shifting from an import market to a domestic
[45:40.780 --> 45:41.620]  production market.
[45:42.180 --> 45:45.540]  So growing weed in your home has only become more popular as we've gotten
[45:45.540 --> 45:46.380]  older.
[45:48.420 --> 45:49.300]  And in Colorado,
[45:49.300 --> 45:53.820]  we've got a couple of great sets of laws where our medical marijuana system
[45:54.260 --> 45:58.300]  lets people treat their ailments with cannabis.
[45:58.320 --> 46:03.020]  They let their doctor determine how much cannabis is necessary. What,
[46:03.020 --> 46:06.140]  how many plants are necessary to produce that medicine regimen.
[46:06.780 --> 46:11.700]  And they allow you to assign a caregiver so that I don't have to spend most of
[46:11.720 --> 46:14.100]  my day perfecting, growing weed.
[46:15.620 --> 46:17.820]  My microphone needs Viagra. That was sad.
[46:17.820 --> 46:19.420]  Just went lip on him all of a sudden.
[46:19.980 --> 46:22.380]  Pointed straight at the floor. Like, Nope, I give up.
[46:24.820 --> 46:29.060]  Um, do without, without you as my caregiver,
[46:30.220 --> 46:35.020]  I couldn't afford my consumption level to keep my pain to the level where I'm
[46:35.020 --> 46:38.460]  fully productive members society. Um,
[46:38.660 --> 46:42.060]  I would have to treat at least some of my pain
[46:43.540 --> 46:47.620]  some other way that was not
[46:48.340 --> 46:50.660]  expensive. Like, cause I don't have a bunch of,
[46:50.940 --> 46:52.820]  like I don't have money to throw away on pills.
[46:52.820 --> 46:56.980]  Right. Um, I got 17 dogs and a kid.
[46:58.540 --> 47:01.460]  Like I've got plenty of mouths to feed.
[47:01.460 --> 47:04.860]  I don't have money to be thrown away on any sort of excess.
[47:04.940 --> 47:09.780]  And so if I had to buy what you produce for me,
[47:10.420 --> 47:11.900]  even in a med shop,
[47:12.380 --> 47:16.660]  even in a med shop in Colorado that was giving me a pretty decent,
[47:17.260 --> 47:21.780]  uh, assign us as your caregiver discounts,
[47:22.060 --> 47:26.820]  I would still be paying at least 50% more than I am now guaranteed.
[47:26.860 --> 47:29.700]  If not a full a hundred percent more than I'm paying now.
[47:30.100 --> 47:31.300]  And you wouldn't get what you get.
[47:31.620 --> 47:34.260]  Yeah. I wouldn't get the quality or the quantity that I'm getting.
[47:34.620 --> 47:37.780]  And you wouldn't be able to get the grateful dog that you asked for.
[47:37.780 --> 47:39.580]  And that I know is Mike's favorite.
[47:39.580 --> 47:41.620]  I smelled it walking in people.
[47:41.740 --> 47:45.500]  I wasn't quite sure what it was cause it's been eight or nine months since I've
[47:45.500 --> 47:46.340]  had any,
[47:46.660 --> 47:50.020]  but I walked in the front door and the first words out of my mouth was what is
[47:50.060 --> 47:53.700]  that delicious smell? And Jeff laughed. It's the clothes he was trimming in earlier.
[47:55.260 --> 47:58.620]  Yeah. It's a stink like grateful dog. Hey, good segue, bro. Uh,
[47:58.660 --> 48:03.020]  you just said clothes you've been trimming in ladies and Martha Farkin gentlemen.
[48:03.460 --> 48:08.340]  I got a box in the mail yesterday of these fucking super sexy grow from your
[48:08.340 --> 48:12.540]  heart podcast t-shirts. Isn't that logo? That is so bright.
[48:12.540 --> 48:14.460]  Mike's taking one home. So they are running out.
[48:14.460 --> 48:17.460]  You guys have got probably 15 of the 25 left.
[48:17.460 --> 48:19.980]  So if you'd like a grow from your heart podcast t-shirt,
[48:20.380 --> 48:24.100]  the front of them has the grow from your heart logo without my face.
[48:24.100 --> 48:26.100]  It doesn't have my face on it. That's why I'm wearing it.
[48:26.100 --> 48:29.740]  I did not like the hoodies with my face on it. It felt weird wearing that. Uh,
[48:29.980 --> 48:32.620]  so I'm wearing the t-shirt. You guys can wear the one with my face.
[48:32.700 --> 48:35.780]  It's got my face. That was just weird. You weren't sure with your face, bro.
[48:35.860 --> 48:38.380]  I am, man. I'm mad. Don't be Steve. Uh, yes, yes.
[48:38.380 --> 48:41.060]  I was that guy for a little bit. I had my own face on my back,
[48:41.540 --> 48:43.700]  but I've got the t-shirt. There's no, my face on it.
[48:43.980 --> 48:46.780]  It says the grow from your heart podcast, nice and large across the chest.
[48:47.180 --> 48:51.260]  The colors are vivid. You guys it's red, yellow, and green is Rasta far-eyed out.
[48:52.220 --> 48:54.940]  Mike's putting up a hand signal, trying to tell me something.
[48:54.980 --> 48:57.780]  They're handmade, right? Yes, they are made. They're not handmade.
[48:57.820 --> 49:02.340]  They were made by somebody that their company is called handmade apparel because
[49:02.340 --> 49:03.660]  his name is Adam hand.
[49:04.260 --> 49:06.700]  I was just triple checking before I was like, shout out to handmade.
[49:07.860 --> 49:10.580]  They're so bright, huge, super huge. Shout out to handmade apparel.
[49:10.580 --> 49:12.780]  I didn't want to say that. And you'd be like, Oh no, you were correct.
[49:13.660 --> 49:17.420]  Carl did these. Uh, no, but the, uh, the handmade crew did a super good job.
[49:17.420 --> 49:21.540]  Super speedy turnaround, uh, quality shirts. The shirts are good quality.
[49:21.820 --> 49:25.260]  They're a, they're tag lists and the, uh, yeah, dude,
[49:27.220 --> 49:30.980]  the best thing since sliced bread was always kind of dumb. Cause since sliced,
[49:30.980 --> 49:34.540]  spread was my whole life. The sense tag list is what I think of that.
[49:34.540 --> 49:35.940]  Now that expression comes up.
[49:35.980 --> 49:38.140]  There's no tag to tickle your neck. Uh,
[49:38.180 --> 49:41.780]  cause my dreadlocks will rub on the collar of the shirt and push the tag into my
[49:41.820 --> 49:44.180]  back all day. It's kind of weird, but on the back of the shirt,
[49:44.180 --> 49:46.420]  ladies and gentlemen, it says,
[49:46.660 --> 49:50.460]  take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me. And I fucking love it.
[49:50.580 --> 49:51.980]  There's something funny about wearing a shirt.
[49:51.980 --> 49:54.100]  This is take a fat dab and give your mama a hug for me.
[49:54.100 --> 49:55.860]  I haven't worn it in public yet. Cause I got it, uh,
[49:55.940 --> 49:59.780]  yesterday and I haven't gone out a box today. Yeah. But trust me,
[49:59.820 --> 50:02.220]  this will get worn out. People will see this. Uh,
[50:02.220 --> 50:04.780]  I pretty much just where I read genetics and grow from your heart.
[50:04.780 --> 50:06.780]  T-shirts all the time. Unless I'm at work.
[50:07.140 --> 50:09.380]  Then I rock the veg bloom shirts that they gave me at work.
[50:09.460 --> 50:10.620]  It's going on a trip with me.
[50:10.940 --> 50:13.900]  Nice. You're going to take it to Mexico and wear it. I'll do wear it on the plane.
[50:15.460 --> 50:19.300]  The question Mark face. I don't want to get searched again. Okay. That is true.
[50:19.340 --> 50:23.860]  But it's funny. I, when I saw the shot of the shirt,
[50:23.900 --> 50:26.180]  I said, Hey babe, look,
[50:26.220 --> 50:29.700]  I finally have a shirt that I can wear that doesn't scream cannabis.
[50:29.700 --> 50:32.660]  And she shook her head. She goes, what part of that doesn't scream cannabis?
[50:33.300 --> 50:35.660]  And I was like, it doesn't say anything about weed on it. It doesn't,
[50:35.700 --> 50:39.300]  there's just no pot leaf. And she goes, it's Rasta colors.
[50:39.300 --> 50:43.660]  And it says grow in giant letters from your heart on it.
[50:43.820 --> 50:46.580]  And like, she didn't even see the back. And I was just going to put my head down.
[50:46.580 --> 50:48.740]  I was like, fuck you. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[50:48.940 --> 50:52.260]  The back does say take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[50:52.500 --> 50:54.340]  Well, since you're going on a trip and you know,
[50:54.340 --> 50:55.940]  you're not taking anything illegal with you,
[50:55.940 --> 50:59.860]  maybe you should wear that and be bait be a decoy so that some dude that does
[50:59.860 --> 51:02.580]  have drugs in his butt gets away with it. Nope. Oh man.
[51:02.620 --> 51:03.980]  Sometimes you got to take one for the team.
[51:04.340 --> 51:06.740]  I don't know if you've been to Mexico before, but, uh,
[51:07.020 --> 51:12.020]  their typical security thing is you line up in customs and then like your little
[51:12.140 --> 51:12.980]  group,
[51:12.980 --> 51:16.260]  one of you pushes the button and a stoplight in front of you,
[51:16.260 --> 51:19.300]  the red, yellow, green goes either red or green.
[51:20.940 --> 51:24.060]  Green means keep walking. Red means you don't keep walking.
[51:25.660 --> 51:27.060]  You're about to have a bad time.
[51:27.100 --> 51:30.380]  All your stuff is going to get dumped into a pile and then randomly stuff back
[51:30.380 --> 51:31.660]  in your suitcase. Angrily.
[51:32.340 --> 51:36.540]  Like I don't want to up the odds on that red light coming on any time.
[51:36.540 --> 51:39.740]  Cause you know, they've got to switch to be like, this fucker's got dreads.
[51:39.740 --> 51:40.580]  Red, red, red.
[51:40.780 --> 51:44.940]  Guaranteed. Uh, I've had my dreadlocks gone through by a TSA agent before. Uh,
[51:44.940 --> 51:46.780]  this lady was like, what's in your hat, honey. And I was like,
[51:46.780 --> 51:48.980]  that's my dreadlocks. And she's like, there's no hair in there.
[51:49.300 --> 51:51.740]  And then she made me take off my hat and she put on rubber gloves and went
[51:51.740 --> 51:55.500]  through my dreadlocks. I was like, that's just hair. I'm offended right now.
[51:55.740 --> 51:58.140]  But she didn't give a fuck. Ladies and gentlemen,
[51:58.300 --> 52:02.060]  if you were interested in one of these hella sexy grow from your heart podcast

[53:40.420 --> 53:43.940]  we can't, we can't promise that granny's going. Uh, I am the boss.

[54:33.700 --> 54:38.380]  Do one email, not 11 bone Ellis. Oh, your life is rough. Uh,
[54:38.420 --> 54:42.220]  both was supposed to, uh, try to get out to Colorado to do a podcast with me,
[54:42.740 --> 54:47.300]  but her computer took a big fat giant shit on her the other night. Yeah.
[54:47.500 --> 54:49.940]  That's that travel money and equipment. So yeah. Uh,
[54:49.980 --> 54:53.300]  and I've been trying to encourage Bo to buy herself a Mac book instead of
[54:53.300 --> 54:56.580]  fucking with windows. Cause that seems to be most of her problem. Uh,
[54:56.620 --> 54:59.300]  and her high ass is a big part of her problem. She admitted it.
[54:59.300 --> 55:01.780]  She's like, I might've just been high. You probably were Bo,
[55:01.780 --> 55:04.540]  but your other problem is that you're fucking with the windows machine. Uh,
[55:04.540 --> 55:08.740]  I've got a two terabyte, uh, external hard drive and a Mac book.
[55:08.740 --> 55:12.700]  And I record onto the Mac book and then I drop it all to the external hard drive
[55:12.700 --> 55:15.100]  so that I've got it on both places. And now if something goes wrong,
[55:15.100 --> 55:16.260]  and it's right over there on the hard drive,
[55:16.660 --> 55:19.020]  almost everything I've got backs up to that hard drive.
[55:19.220 --> 55:21.580]  I'll have to just plug it in and the computer just goes, Oh,
[55:21.620 --> 55:24.540]  there's that thing. And it knows just back up right then. So Bo,
[55:24.580 --> 55:26.780]  that's what you got to do. Ladies and gentlemen,

[55:44.220 --> 55:47.700]  So she's got to not do a whole bunch of stuff in her life so she can get new
[55:47.700 --> 55:50.180]  equipment to keep doing it. Um,
[55:50.260 --> 55:55.500]  I'm looking at 50 odd blinky lights in 600 odd
[55:55.500 --> 55:56.340]  knobs.
[55:56.380 --> 55:59.660]  You don't need nearly that much equipment to record this much,
[55:59.660 --> 56:03.700]  but there's a reason we sound this good. Yes. So I sound good.
[56:03.740 --> 56:07.100]  Everything's going cool. If you guys, if you're burning to throw a dollar,
[56:07.100 --> 56:08.180]  it's somebody, uh,
[56:08.220 --> 56:12.780]  go to patreon.com and search for the spliff podcast and then let Bo know that,
[56:13.100 --> 56:13.500]  uh,
[56:13.500 --> 56:17.700]  you heard that she needed some help to get her audio fixed up and let her know
[56:17.700 --> 56:19.700]  that you're trying to help her out from and make it,
[56:19.700 --> 56:21.740]  let her know that you heard about it through us. You know, just don't,
[56:21.740 --> 56:24.420]  don't give us credit, but let her know you heard from us so that she can get a
[56:24.420 --> 56:26.260]  little smile. Be like rusted. Jeff's helping us out.
[56:27.180 --> 56:29.540]  We want her to keep doing that show. You guys, it's good fucking show. All right,
[56:30.020 --> 56:31.660]  Mike, we're high. We're rambly.
[56:31.700 --> 56:34.700]  I've got a dab of this lemon Jeffrey sitting here that I really want to take.
[56:34.720 --> 56:38.700]  So I think we're going to wrap up this podcast, bro. Have a good time in Mexico.
[56:39.020 --> 56:42.220]  Don't ever let go of that baby. Uh, if you see another kid fall down,
[56:42.220 --> 56:44.340]  uncle Joey taught me this. If you're at the playground,
[56:44.340 --> 56:46.860]  you see another kid fall down. Don't look away from your kid.
[56:46.940 --> 56:51.380]  It's a fucking trap dog. Sorry, uncle Joey taught me that shout out to Joey Diaz.
[56:52.740 --> 56:56.740]  We're going to have a good time. Get away for a little while. And uh, honestly,
[56:56.740 --> 56:57.860]  I just can't wait to get back.
[56:58.300 --> 57:00.820]  Yeah. Sometimes that's the best part of a vacation is getting home.
[57:01.140 --> 57:06.140]  Well, there's the vacation is the culmination of like 50 things in my life.
[57:06.340 --> 57:08.580]  Like just personally,
[57:08.580 --> 57:11.660]  the election was going to answer a bunch of questions and then the way the
[57:12.020 --> 57:15.060]  election panned out locally and statewide and nationally,
[57:15.420 --> 57:17.740]  some of that shit stayed up in the air until now.
[57:18.380 --> 57:22.100]  And finally all the coins are landing and I know if it's heads or tails and we
[57:22.100 --> 57:23.700]  can start moving forward, dude, I'm pumped.
[57:24.220 --> 57:28.020]  I just got to get back from Mexico and get that hurdle out of the way and get
[57:28.380 --> 57:31.620]  your feet on the ground running again. You'll be back, bro. You'll get it going.
[57:31.900 --> 57:34.820]  Uh, Jesse Witt just text me. So big shout out to Jesse grows.
[57:35.380 --> 57:37.100]  I think that's all we've got for this podcast.
[57:37.300 --> 57:41.420]  I think that is it for this episode. Follow Mike on social media. Yes,
[57:41.420 --> 57:44.220]  we do. We love each and every one of you. The new listeners, the old listeners.
[57:44.500 --> 57:47.340]  I don't think that I don't love the people that don't contribute to Patreon.
[57:47.380 --> 57:51.180]  I love all y'all just the same. Yeah, we love it. We appreciate the Patreon help.
[57:51.180 --> 57:53.180]  That's awesome. It helps me cover the cost of the website.
[57:53.180 --> 57:56.300]  It helps me cover all the expenses. Super rad. I appreciate you guys.
[57:57.820 --> 58:01.060]  I really liked the people that leave iTunes comments. That really helps out too.
[58:01.860 --> 58:04.740]  All right, you guys were fucking rambly. I need to take this dab. I'm hungry.
[58:04.780 --> 58:09.140]  Why am I so hungry? Oh man, food time. Hungry like a hostage over here. All right.
[58:09.180 --> 58:12.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to give a huge shout out to Tim,
[58:12.060 --> 58:15.820]  Charlie and all of my friends at Organica in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
[58:17.140 --> 58:18.500]  Yeah, they're doing a great job down there.
[58:18.500 --> 58:20.860]  Also a big shout out to Mike for coming and taking time away from the baby.
[58:21.900 --> 58:23.460]  That's all I've got for you for this week. And until next time,
[58:23.460 --> 58:26.380]  you guys take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
