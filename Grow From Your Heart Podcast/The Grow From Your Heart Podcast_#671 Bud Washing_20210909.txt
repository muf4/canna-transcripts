[00:19.260 --> 00:21.140]  All right, here we go.
[00:21.140 --> 00:22.500]  Welcome back, Podcast World.
[00:22.500 --> 00:29.220]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff, and this is episode number 671 of the Grow
[00:29.220 --> 00:31.100]  From Your Heart podcast.
[00:31.100 --> 00:34.740]  In this episode, I'm going to talk about bud washing before we get to that part of the
[00:34.740 --> 00:35.740]  show.
[00:35.740 --> 00:40.380]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few of those great folks who support the show on Patreon.
[00:40.380 --> 00:42.740]  Let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:42.740 --> 00:45.180]  Thank you, shout out to my buddy, Alabama Man.
[00:45.180 --> 00:47.580]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Chief Leaf 420.
[00:48.220 --> 00:51.060]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to Scooter.
[00:51.060 --> 00:54.620]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to a longtime supporter, my buddy, Kwasi.
[00:54.620 --> 00:58.420]  Let's send a thank you shout out to a fellow podcaster Karibuheart TV.
[00:58.420 --> 01:01.840]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to a longtime supporter and a good friend,
[01:01.840 --> 01:03.540]  my buddy, Glenn Gironi.
[01:03.540 --> 01:05.740]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Guido and Frugal Rock.
[01:05.740 --> 01:10.300]  Let's send a thank you shout out to another a long time supporter, my buddy, AllMixedUp.
[01:10.300 --> 01:12.940]  Let's send a special thank you shout out to Roll This Nug.
[01:12.940 --> 01:16.940]  And then let's wrap up the shout outs with a big thank you shout out to my buddy, Stoned
[01:16.940 --> 01:18.580]  Trout Bomb.
[01:18.580 --> 01:23.180]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:23.180 --> 01:26.780]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:26.780 --> 01:33.060]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.

[01:36.260 --> 01:41.780]  link in the show notes and in the video description to make it super easy for all of my friends.
[01:41.780 --> 01:42.780]  You know the rules.
[01:42.780 --> 01:46.060]  If you're driving, if you're working, don't pull out the phone, don't get yourself in
[01:46.060 --> 01:47.380]  any danger right now.
[01:47.380 --> 01:49.740]  The link will be there when you've got time.
[01:49.740 --> 01:54.620]  Patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart.
[01:54.620 --> 01:59.500]  This is the part of the podcast where I do cordially invite you to join the discord server.
[01:59.500 --> 02:00.500]  That's right.
[02:00.500 --> 02:03.380]  There is a link to the discord server in the show notes and the video description.
[02:03.380 --> 02:06.060]  I'm also putting the link right here so you could see that.
[02:06.060 --> 02:09.700]  Type that in manually if that's something you want to do, but join us on the discord
[02:09.700 --> 02:10.980]  server again.
[02:10.980 --> 02:13.860]  If you're driving, if you've got the kids, if you're trimming, don't get yourself in
[02:13.860 --> 02:14.860]  trouble.
[02:14.860 --> 02:15.860]  Don't put yourself in danger.
[02:16.660 --> 02:19.700]  The discord link will be there when you've got time, but I do invite you to join us on
[02:19.700 --> 02:20.780]  discord.
[02:20.780 --> 02:25.100]  Jump into the discord server, meet my friend Rasta bot and join the party.
[02:25.100 --> 02:27.900]  There's a lot of cool stuff happening on the discord server.
[02:27.900 --> 02:29.520]  There are a lot of cool people there.
[02:29.520 --> 02:32.260]  There's a live video chat where people are hanging out right now.
[02:32.260 --> 02:34.380]  A Canadian weed nerd is probably there.
[02:34.380 --> 02:38.260]  Billy Podunk is probably there hanging out talking about growing cannabis, talking about
[02:38.260 --> 02:39.460]  life right now.
[02:39.460 --> 02:40.800]  There's a grow chat section.
[02:40.800 --> 02:42.980]  There's a strain chat section.
[02:42.980 --> 02:46.260]  There's even a section to go talk about fish or reggae music.
[02:46.260 --> 02:49.580]  If you need something to do, someone to hang out with, want to talk about cannabis, want
[02:49.580 --> 02:53.340]  to learn about iRegenetics or just want to hang out with the crew, we cordially invite
[02:53.340 --> 02:55.860]  you to come hang out on the discord server.
[02:55.860 --> 03:01.380]  Once again, there is a link in the show notes and in the video description.
[03:01.380 --> 03:06.100]  Really quickly, I do want to apologize that the last episode was shorter than normal.
[03:06.100 --> 03:08.140]  I did cut out a good chunk of that episode.
[03:08.140 --> 03:11.540]  I don't know if you noticed my magical editing skills.
[03:11.540 --> 03:16.740]  I removed a good portion of that show that I felt I got way off track and I was basically
[03:16.740 --> 03:19.220]  talking to and for myself.
[03:19.220 --> 03:22.340]  I didn't want to punish you by leaving that in the show, so I cut it out.
[03:22.340 --> 03:24.500]  I apologize for the short show.
[03:24.500 --> 03:28.760]  Sometimes a short, quick episode is better than a long, bullshitted episode.
[03:28.760 --> 03:31.500]  It's easier just to come in and say, here's the point, here's the lesson, here's how you
[03:31.500 --> 03:32.500]  do it.
[03:32.500 --> 03:33.500]  Wish you success.
[03:33.500 --> 03:34.500]  I'm out.
[03:34.500 --> 03:35.500]  Have a good day.
[03:35.500 --> 03:38.300]  There's no need for me just to sit here and extend shit just to make the episode look
[03:38.300 --> 03:40.380]  longer on YouTube.
[03:40.380 --> 03:41.820]  Quality over quantity.
[03:41.820 --> 03:44.340]  And I've got ADD, you've got ADD.
[03:44.340 --> 03:46.380]  Maybe that short episode was exactly what we needed.
[03:46.380 --> 03:48.780]  If you need a longer episode, listen to two.
[03:48.780 --> 03:52.220]  Or I've got plenty of friends out there doing podcasts that you will enjoy as well.
[03:52.220 --> 03:54.300]  But I do apologize for the short show.
[03:54.300 --> 03:55.300]  Try to keep it good.
[03:55.300 --> 03:56.300]  Try to keep it tight.
[03:56.300 --> 03:57.940]  I felt like I had to cut out some bullshit.
[03:57.940 --> 03:58.940]  That was for all of our benefit.
[03:58.940 --> 04:00.740]  All right, where do we go from here?
[04:00.740 --> 04:06.820]  I want to give a big thank you, shout out, fist bump, hug, high five, smile, spread some
[04:06.820 --> 04:13.220]  vibes to all of the friends and family that I saw at the Phish concerts in Denver over
[04:13.220 --> 04:14.220]  the weekend.
[04:14.220 --> 04:17.460]  That's right, I try not to brag, boast too much about the amazing shit that I get to
[04:17.460 --> 04:18.460]  do in my life.
[04:18.460 --> 04:23.060]  But if you know me, if we're friends, and if not, here's a little insight into my life.
[04:23.060 --> 04:24.140]  Phish is my favorite band.
[04:24.140 --> 04:26.540]  I've got a few bands that I really enjoy.
[04:26.540 --> 04:28.260]  Phish with a P-H, P-H-I-S-H.
[04:28.260 --> 04:29.660]  If you never heard of them, check them out.
[04:29.660 --> 04:30.700]  Phish is my favorite band.
[04:30.700 --> 04:32.240]  There's nothing like it.
[04:32.240 --> 04:34.100]  No two shows will ever be the same.
[04:34.100 --> 04:35.100]  Every show is different.
[04:35.100 --> 04:38.420]  They never play the same songs within a week.
[04:38.420 --> 04:41.780]  So if they played your favorite song Friday, you won't hear it again until next Friday,
[04:41.780 --> 04:43.540]  if you're lucky.
[04:43.540 --> 04:48.860]  I got to go see, I went and saw Phish for three nights in a row at Dick's Sporting Goods,
[04:48.860 --> 04:51.300]  the big soccer field in Denver in Commerce City.
[04:51.300 --> 04:54.380]  And I had the time of my freaking life.
[04:54.380 --> 04:57.600]  We've been on this weird, I don't even like to talk about quarantine or all the weird
[04:57.600 --> 05:00.140]  shit we've been going through for the past two years.
[05:00.140 --> 05:01.140]  We've been locked down.
[05:01.140 --> 05:04.660]  It's been nice to get out and dance and boogie and see some fucking music.
[05:05.220 --> 05:06.220]  It was such a good time.
[05:06.220 --> 05:07.620]  You guys, I feel so good about it.
[05:07.620 --> 05:10.140]  But part of the fun, Phish is a big part of the fun.
[05:10.140 --> 05:11.140]  Phish is why we go.
[05:11.140 --> 05:12.700]  The band Phish puts on a great show.
[05:12.700 --> 05:14.140]  They play great music, in my opinion.
[05:14.140 --> 05:15.780]  They put me in a great mindset.
[05:15.780 --> 05:17.780]  That's only a portion of the event.
[05:17.780 --> 05:22.380]  A big portion of that event is going and seeing old friends, catching up with old friends.
[05:22.380 --> 05:24.720]  There are some people I only see at Phish shows.
[05:24.720 --> 05:27.860]  There are some people that I see often, but we definitely know we'll see each other at
[05:27.860 --> 05:28.940]  Phish shows.
[05:28.940 --> 05:32.000]  And then there are people that I meet for the first time at Phish shows.
[05:32.000 --> 05:34.620]  And it is a wonderful experience doing all of the above.
[05:34.620 --> 05:38.380]  Seeing the old crew, meeting the new crew, and then just seeing the Phish crew is always
[05:38.380 --> 05:40.140]  a beautiful experience.
[05:40.140 --> 05:44.520]  So I want to send a big shout out, a big thank you, a big hug, a high five, a funky dance
[05:44.520 --> 05:47.400]  move to all of the people that I bumped into at Phish.
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.940]  If we spent the weekend grooving in a section together, big shout out to section 107, big
[05:51.940 --> 05:52.940]  up.
[05:52.940 --> 05:54.020]  You guys held it down.
[05:54.020 --> 05:57.260]  Everybody in 107, if we hung out and got down together, big fist bump.
[05:57.260 --> 06:00.740]  I'm not going to even try to remember all the names, but even the people who thought
[06:00.740 --> 06:03.060]  I'd forget their names, Pete and Leandro, I remember, bro.
[06:03.500 --> 06:04.780]  But I got all your names in my head.
[06:04.780 --> 06:05.980]  Big shout out to all those great folks.
[06:05.980 --> 06:06.980]  I got your business cards.
[06:06.980 --> 06:07.980]  We will be in touch.
[06:07.980 --> 06:10.540]  If we were brand new friends, that was a great time.
[06:10.540 --> 06:17.020]  If you walked by and gave me a high five, a fist bump, a nod, a hug, just tap me on
[06:17.020 --> 06:18.420]  the shoulder and give me a thumbs up.
[06:18.420 --> 06:22.140]  If you walked by and said, great podcast, however you did it, thank you.
[06:22.140 --> 06:24.420]  I appreciate it.
[06:24.420 --> 06:25.540]  I was having a good ass time.
[06:25.540 --> 06:27.540]  I was dancing to Phish and I was having a good time.
[06:27.540 --> 06:32.420]  I was trying not to interrupt the Phish experience to talk to people, but the people I did talk
[06:33.420 --> 06:36.260]  between sets and during set break, beautiful time.
[06:36.260 --> 06:37.260]  Thank you.
[06:37.260 --> 06:41.220]  Again, shout out to everybody for the fist bumps, the high fives, the hugs, the handshakes,
[06:41.220 --> 06:44.340]  the stickers, the treats, the snacks, the food.
[06:44.340 --> 06:47.780]  I was giving gifts and food and drinks.
[06:47.780 --> 06:50.600]  They saw what I was drinking and they saw that my beverage was low and they came out
[06:50.600 --> 06:52.140]  of nowhere with a fresh beverage for me.
[06:52.140 --> 06:54.420]  I was like, people are amazing at Phish shows.
[06:54.420 --> 06:55.500]  It was a really good time.
[06:55.500 --> 06:58.220]  I met some new people, people from all over the place.
[06:58.220 --> 07:02.820]  I got to see a friend who has lived in Thailand and Vietnam and shit for the past few years.
[07:02.820 --> 07:05.980]  I don't think I've seen him since probably 10 years ago at a Phish show.
[07:05.980 --> 07:07.100]  I got to bump into that guy.
[07:07.100 --> 07:08.100]  We gave each other a hug.
[07:08.100 --> 07:10.660]  We talked for a few minutes, talked about some future endeavors.
[07:10.660 --> 07:13.660]  He skedaddled off to go back into the Phish show and do his thing.
[07:13.660 --> 07:14.860]  He's out there having a good time.
[07:14.860 --> 07:19.940]  I met some great folks from Hawaii, some folks from Indiana, some folks from PA.
[07:19.940 --> 07:20.940]  There's folks from everywhere.
[07:20.940 --> 07:21.940]  We had a good time.
[07:21.940 --> 07:22.940]  I'm going to quit gushing about the Phish show.
[07:22.940 --> 07:24.940]  Obviously, guys, I had an amazing fucking time.
[07:24.940 --> 07:25.940]  I wanted to talk about it.
[07:25.940 --> 07:29.140]  I wanted to share with you guys what I do, but I owe a bunch of people fist bumps, high
[07:29.140 --> 07:31.420]  fives, thank yous, and shout outs.
[07:31.420 --> 07:34.740]  If we just made eye contact and you knew who I was and you gave me the nod because you
[07:34.740 --> 07:36.100]  didn't want to interrupt, respect.
[07:36.100 --> 07:37.100]  I saw you.
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.100]  We had a good time.
[07:38.100 --> 07:39.100]  Thank you.
[07:39.100 --> 07:40.140]  If you came up and you're like, bro, are you Rasta Jeff?
[07:40.140 --> 07:41.140]  That was me, bro.
[07:41.140 --> 07:42.140]  We had a good time.
[07:42.140 --> 07:43.140]  It was great meeting you.
[07:43.140 --> 07:44.140]  It felt so good.
[07:44.140 --> 07:47.180]  I made some new friends and we're hanging out in a little group.
[07:47.180 --> 07:50.500]  Every few minutes, somebody would walk by and they'd be like, Rasta Jeff, and they'd
[07:50.500 --> 07:52.420]  just high five me or give me a hug or something.
[07:52.420 --> 07:54.460]  Just be like, love the podcast, bro.
[07:54.460 --> 07:55.460]  Somebody just walked by and goes, oh, rise.
[07:55.460 --> 07:57.940]  I was like, well, that was awkward.
[07:57.940 --> 08:01.220]  But then eventually the people that I was with were like, hey, why do they keep saying
[08:01.220 --> 08:02.220]  that shit to you?
[08:02.220 --> 08:03.220]  I had to explain.
[08:03.220 --> 08:04.620]  I was like, oh, I have a weed podcast and all that good stuff.
[08:04.620 --> 08:06.060]  That was entertainingly fun.
[08:06.060 --> 08:07.620]  Had a good time.
[08:07.620 --> 08:09.780]  Everybody that was there, see you next year.
[08:09.780 --> 08:11.160]  Can't wait for next year to party.
[08:11.160 --> 08:12.160]  Let's get it on.
[08:12.160 --> 08:16.700]  All right, big fist bumps, big shout outs, big hugs, big high fives, big vibes, big weird
[08:16.700 --> 08:18.300]  dance moves to all of you folks.
[08:18.300 --> 08:22.020]  Now, let's move on to the main topic of this podcast.
[08:22.020 --> 08:24.220]  I know I get rambly at the start of the show.
[08:24.980 --> 08:27.380]  Sometimes people do complain about it in the comments that I get rambly at the start of
[08:27.380 --> 08:28.380]  the show.
[08:28.380 --> 08:29.380]  It takes five minutes to get into it.
[08:29.380 --> 08:30.380]  But guess what?
[08:30.380 --> 08:31.500]  It's a podcast.
[08:31.500 --> 08:32.500]  It's free.
[08:32.500 --> 08:33.500]  And I do get a little rambly.
[08:33.500 --> 08:34.500]  I'm trying to find a rhythm.
[08:34.500 --> 08:35.500]  I'm finding my space.
[08:35.500 --> 08:36.500]  I'm finding my zone.
[08:36.500 --> 08:38.540]  I think it feels better than just going one, two, three.
[08:38.540 --> 08:39.900]  Here we go talking about bud washing.
[08:39.900 --> 08:41.620]  I try to get comfortable, bring you in.
[08:41.620 --> 08:43.160]  Some people want to hang out.
[08:43.160 --> 08:46.980]  If not, bro, hit that fast forward button, get to the part or don't, whatever.
[08:46.980 --> 08:49.740]  Anyway, see, that's the kind of stuff I cut out of the last episode.
[08:49.740 --> 08:51.380]  I'm not going to cut that out of this one.
[08:51.380 --> 08:56.540]  The main topic of today's episode is bud washing and that's bud washing with a D, washing
[08:56.540 --> 08:57.540]  your buds.
[08:57.540 --> 08:58.540]  That's right.
[08:58.540 --> 08:59.620]  You should already be washing everything else.
[08:59.620 --> 09:01.580]  Today we're going to learn about bud washing.
[09:01.580 --> 09:06.140]  I'm discovering that a lot of people are experiencing problems in their outdoor grow early this
[09:06.140 --> 09:07.140]  year.
[09:07.140 --> 09:11.740]  I did predict a lot of powdery mildew happening in outdoor grows because if we've had really
[09:11.740 --> 09:16.740]  drastic changes here in Colorado, we've had hot days, cold nights, and lots of rain.
[09:16.740 --> 09:21.300]  And that does add up to powdery mildew situations, powdery mildew environments.
[09:21.340 --> 09:25.300]  I've seen a lot of people on social media posting about their powdery mildew laden buds
[09:25.300 --> 09:27.980]  and they're asking, how do I get rid of this?
[09:27.980 --> 09:29.340]  Then perfectly timed.
[09:29.340 --> 09:34.780]  I got this email on the iRegenetics website where there is the grow help tab.
[09:34.780 --> 09:35.980]  Really quickly, we'll talk about that.
[09:35.980 --> 09:39.380]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, there is a grow help tab.
[09:39.380 --> 09:43.860]  You can click on that and it gives you about 12 preliminary questions asking about your
[09:43.860 --> 09:44.860]  garden.
[09:44.860 --> 09:47.300]  Those few questions help me diagnose your grow.
[09:47.300 --> 09:50.940]  Then we give you the opportunity to type in what's wrong with your grow.
[09:51.580 --> 09:54.820]  You send that to me and I will find that in my email and I will read it and we'll solve
[09:54.820 --> 09:56.580]  your problem here on the show.
[09:56.580 --> 09:58.500]  Go to the website, iRegenetics.com.
[09:58.500 --> 09:59.500]  Go to the grow help tab.
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.860]  That's where this came from.
[10:00.860 --> 10:07.420]  This one came from, name to use on the podcast is Indicalla or Indicaia if it's Spanish.
[10:07.420 --> 10:08.900]  We'll say it's Indicalla.
[10:08.900 --> 10:14.260]  They're growing some Mephisto, Sour Stomper, and Creme de la Chem and Gnome Automatics.
[10:14.260 --> 10:16.860]  A lot of this is unnecessary to read all this info here.
[10:16.860 --> 10:17.860]  We're going to jump right to it.
[10:17.860 --> 10:19.060]  It said, I love your show.
[10:19.060 --> 10:22.380]  I'm a new grower and you've helped me figure out how to do this and I appreciate it.
[10:22.380 --> 10:23.380]  Big respect, bro.
[10:23.380 --> 10:24.380]  Thank you for listening.
[10:24.380 --> 10:26.540]  I hope I'm able to help you out with your first interaction here.
[10:26.540 --> 10:31.460]  It says, I know it's a ton of work and I just wanted to let you know I appreciate your effort.
[10:31.460 --> 10:32.460]  Thank you.
[10:32.460 --> 10:33.460]  There is a point to this question.
[10:33.460 --> 10:37.060]  It says, I don't have a grow problem as much as a general question.
[10:37.060 --> 10:41.340]  I get why bud washing makes sense on outdoor grows and it's logical that outdoor buds can
[10:41.340 --> 10:44.360]  be covered and stuff we don't want to put into our bodies.
[10:44.360 --> 10:47.860]  My question for you is, and this is a very good question.
[10:47.860 --> 10:51.180]  It says, what is your take on bud washing on indoor grows?
[10:51.180 --> 10:54.220]  I've seen some claim even indoor buds are improved by washing.
[10:54.220 --> 10:55.220]  I've read.
[10:55.220 --> 10:58.900]  Okay, so we're going to talk about bud washing and this person is asking about bud washing
[10:58.900 --> 11:00.420]  indoors.
[11:00.420 --> 11:04.640]  And then it says, you would be surprised how much grime comes off the buds even in seemingly
[11:04.640 --> 11:06.140]  controlled environments.
[11:06.140 --> 11:08.860]  Yes, I do agree.
[11:08.860 --> 11:11.860]  I do agree that we gather a lot of funky stuff on those buds.
[11:11.860 --> 11:12.980]  You never know what could be on there.
[11:12.980 --> 11:14.500]  There could be bugs, there could be bug poop.
[11:14.500 --> 11:16.220]  We're going to talk about that in a moment.
[11:16.220 --> 11:21.340]  But I do agree that sometimes it is beneficial to wash indoor buds.
[11:21.340 --> 11:26.060]  What I'm going to talk about will be applicable to indoor and or outdoor products.
[11:26.060 --> 11:27.380]  So keep that in mind.
[11:27.380 --> 11:31.620]  So this next comment I found on YouTube and it was done right after I did the pest management
[11:31.620 --> 11:35.900]  episode and it's referring to using a predatory pest.
[11:35.900 --> 11:40.980]  So if you've got a pest problem and you use another pest to attack that bug, the obvious
[11:40.980 --> 11:43.740]  question was don't all things that eat poop.
[11:43.740 --> 11:48.380]  So the question is, are those predatory pests going to poop out the carcasses of the bug
[11:48.380 --> 11:51.620]  that they ate into my plants, which is a very good question.
[11:51.620 --> 11:55.540]  It says, who wants to smoke half eaten bugs and the poop?
[11:55.540 --> 12:01.260]  So that is a very good question and that is a very good reason to do bud washing.
[12:01.260 --> 12:05.740]  So that is part of what inspired this episode was two great emails and a bunch of social
[12:05.740 --> 12:07.860]  media chatter about bud washing.
[12:07.860 --> 12:10.320]  So now that I've set it up, let's get right to it.
[12:10.320 --> 12:11.320]  Bud washing.
[12:11.320 --> 12:13.460]  What do I mean by bud washing?
[12:13.900 --> 12:16.940]  Your buds will be infested with powdery mildew.
[12:16.940 --> 12:19.540]  Unfortunately it does happen.
[12:19.540 --> 12:23.100]  Sometimes we just want to clean off the buds and get that powdery mildew off of there and
[12:23.100 --> 12:24.820]  the buds will be safe to consume.
[12:24.820 --> 12:26.780]  Some people are going to argue with me now.
[12:26.780 --> 12:28.980]  Some people are going to have varying opinions.
[12:28.980 --> 12:33.660]  In my opinion, if that bud has, if the flowered plant has a little bit of powdery mildew on
[12:33.660 --> 12:38.260]  those leaves, I think we can wash that powdery mildew off with bud washing.
[12:38.260 --> 12:42.300]  It is not something that I would like to do that I would rely on that I would do on a
[12:42.300 --> 12:43.460]  regular basis.
[12:43.460 --> 12:49.540]  But in some emergency cases, especially this year's outdoor crop, this may be necessary.
[12:49.540 --> 12:54.380]  Also this may be beneficial to people who grow for extraction.
[12:54.380 --> 12:59.540]  If you want your extractions to be as clean as they can be, why not wash off the product
[12:59.540 --> 13:03.780]  that you're going to extract before you put it through the extraction process?
[13:03.780 --> 13:08.660]  If you don't put dirt, grime, dust, bug shit, bug poop into your extraction machines, you
[13:08.660 --> 13:11.260]  don't have to take that out of the process.
[13:11.260 --> 13:13.860]  You don't have to clean it up and take that out of the final product.
[13:13.860 --> 13:15.900]  So bud washing.
[13:15.900 --> 13:17.820]  Sometimes you get powdery mildew.
[13:17.820 --> 13:19.660]  Often there are bugs on your plants.
[13:19.660 --> 13:21.020]  Often there are bug eggs.
[13:21.020 --> 13:25.300]  Like this person said, anything that is laying eggs or eating another bug is also going to
[13:25.300 --> 13:26.300]  take a shit.
[13:26.300 --> 13:29.620]  So you've got some bug shit to go into your plants now.
[13:29.620 --> 13:33.420]  Oftentimes outdoors, you will discover bird poop on your plants.
[13:33.420 --> 13:36.540]  There's not much you can do about that unless you've got a greenhouse.
[13:36.540 --> 13:37.540]  Birds are going to fly over.
[13:37.540 --> 13:40.460]  They're going to drop a turd and sometimes it's going to land right on your plants.
[13:40.660 --> 13:42.260]  I've got a good way to wash that off.
[13:42.260 --> 13:44.340]  This is very effective for that.
[13:44.340 --> 13:46.060]  Sometimes you get spider webs outside.
[13:46.060 --> 13:48.700]  Sometimes a spider says, hey, I see shit flying around here.
[13:48.700 --> 13:50.700]  There's a lot of plants attracting a lot of things.
[13:50.700 --> 13:52.760]  I'm going to build a web from this plant to this plant.
[13:52.760 --> 13:57.180]  Everything that flies through, fucking dinner for the next couple of weeks until they harvest.
[13:57.180 --> 13:58.940]  You'll get spider webs.
[13:58.940 --> 14:00.860]  Then you will get dust and dirt.
[14:00.860 --> 14:03.200]  Now's a good time for me to make a quick disclaimer.
[14:03.200 --> 14:06.420]  If you hear the weirdness in my nose, sorry for that.
[14:06.420 --> 14:07.420]  That was really rude.
[14:07.420 --> 14:10.740]  If you hear the weird nasally sound in my voice, that is because I spent three days
[14:10.740 --> 14:13.340]  on a dirt parking lot, sucking up dirt and dust.
[14:13.340 --> 14:15.500]  I have got a little nasal thing happening.
[14:15.500 --> 14:16.500]  I feel fine.
[14:16.500 --> 14:19.740]  I feel good, but there's a lot of dirt in my nose and it kind of wrecked me.
[14:19.740 --> 14:23.500]  There's a lot of dirt and dust on the grow in the plants and they're sticky.
[14:23.500 --> 14:25.020]  They're trichomes.
[14:25.020 --> 14:29.300]  The powdery mildew, the bugs, the bug eggs, the bug poop, the bird poop, spider webs,
[14:29.300 --> 14:30.300]  dust and dirt.
[14:30.300 --> 14:31.860]  Then who knows what else?
[14:31.860 --> 14:32.860]  Who knows what else?
[14:32.860 --> 14:35.420]  Maybe who even knows what else is stuck to those plants?
[14:35.420 --> 14:37.180]  It could be anything outdoors.
[14:37.940 --> 14:41.820]  You see weird shit, cocoons and fucking bug eggs and weird larvae and things could be
[14:41.820 --> 14:43.020]  stuck to those.
[14:43.020 --> 14:46.100]  Whatever the wind blew by could be stuck to your plants.
[14:46.100 --> 14:48.540]  So why not wash that stuff off?
[14:48.540 --> 14:52.220]  It would be a really good idea if you're going to smoke it, eat it, consume it, make extracts
[14:52.220 --> 14:53.220]  off of it.
[14:53.220 --> 14:54.900]  We'd wash our fruits and vegetables.
[14:54.900 --> 14:59.620]  If I handed you a tomato or a cucumber or an avocado, whatever it's going to be, you'd
[14:59.620 --> 15:01.700]  wash it before you cut it and eat it.
[15:01.700 --> 15:07.340]  We should possibly maybe consider doing that with our products, especially if they've got
[15:07.340 --> 15:11.380]  powdery mildew, bug eggs, poop, bird poop, spider webs, dust and dirt, something like
[15:11.380 --> 15:12.380]  that on it.
[15:12.380 --> 15:13.780]  Why not clean it up?
[15:13.780 --> 15:17.980]  Now, let's get to the, we know why and we know the reasons to do it.
[15:17.980 --> 15:20.340]  Let's get to how to do it.
[15:20.340 --> 15:22.260]  We would harvest just like normal.
[15:22.260 --> 15:23.260]  Harvest your plants just like normal.
[15:23.260 --> 15:26.940]  You got your plant, it's cut down your normal harvest process.
[15:26.940 --> 15:29.860]  Then you've got to cut the buds into manageable pieces.
[15:29.860 --> 15:34.140]  I like to cut the plant down to where I've got a bud and a stick.
[15:34.140 --> 15:37.060]  Then at the end of that stick, I leave a hook.
[15:37.060 --> 15:40.740]  Essentially what I'm doing is I'm taking the main stock of the plant and cutting it above
[15:40.740 --> 15:41.740]  the node.
[15:41.740 --> 15:45.940]  There would be the main stock goes up and a node would come off at an angle.
[15:45.940 --> 15:49.580]  If you cut right below where that node comes off, you've just left yourself a hanger.
[15:49.580 --> 15:54.140]  When it's time to hang that bud up, you can use that little V section as a natural hanger
[15:54.140 --> 15:55.220]  for your plant.
[15:55.220 --> 15:57.660]  You'll see this when it comes time to cut your plant.
[15:57.660 --> 15:59.740]  Cut below the node, you'll leave a little hanger.
[16:00.500 --> 16:04.020]  The main stock will become the short piece of the hanger and the branch with the buds
[16:04.020 --> 16:06.620]  will become the branch with the bud.
[16:06.620 --> 16:08.620]  It will all make sense.
[16:08.620 --> 16:11.020]  I cut them into manageable pieces.
[16:11.020 --> 16:14.540]  For me, I'm going to use a five gallon bucket for my bud washing.
[16:14.540 --> 16:18.880]  I need pieces that are shorter than a five gallon bucket so I can dunk them all the way
[16:18.880 --> 16:19.880]  in there.
[16:19.880 --> 16:23.540]  My goal is to get all the bud matter, all the bud material into the five gallon bucket.
[16:23.540 --> 16:25.340]  I'm going to harvest like normal.
[16:25.380 --> 16:30.660]  I'm probably going to, before harvest, I would normally go and pull off a majority of the
[16:30.660 --> 16:33.900]  large powdery mildew laden fan leaves.
[16:33.900 --> 16:35.860]  All the big leaves with the petiole.
[16:35.860 --> 16:38.900]  Before harvest, you could just go in and strip as many leaves off as you can get.
[16:38.900 --> 16:40.020]  Go take off the leaves.
[16:40.020 --> 16:42.000]  Don't get aggressive and fuck up the buds.
[16:42.000 --> 16:43.220]  Take off all the leaves.
[16:43.220 --> 16:44.220]  Strip them.
[16:44.220 --> 16:45.220]  Destroy those leaves.
[16:45.220 --> 16:46.220]  They've got powdery mildew.
[16:46.220 --> 16:47.220]  Get them out of there.
[16:47.220 --> 16:48.220]  Maybe wear a mask while you're doing this.
[16:48.220 --> 16:49.220]  Definitely wear gloves.
[16:49.220 --> 16:50.220]  Stay safe.
[16:50.220 --> 16:51.340]  Get in there and defoliate.
[16:51.340 --> 16:52.340]  Cut down your plants.
[16:52.340 --> 16:53.660]  Cut them into manageable pieces.
[16:53.660 --> 16:56.500]  Leave sticks so you can hang them after they are dunked.
[16:56.500 --> 17:01.740]  Then this is when we're going to actually start cleaning up the buds.
[17:01.740 --> 17:04.700]  One more thing I should mention, gloves.
[17:04.700 --> 17:08.820]  We're going to use a five gallon bucket filled with water.
[17:08.820 --> 17:11.000]  You can use regular tap water, RO water.
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.740]  That doesn't matter too much to me.
[17:12.740 --> 17:22.260]  We're going to add 25 to 50 milliliters of 30% hydrogen peroxide to five gallons of water.
[17:22.260 --> 17:23.500]  Let me repeat that.
[17:24.340 --> 17:28.300]  That is 25 to 50 milliliters per five gallons.
[17:28.300 --> 17:31.420]  You can go harder if you want, but I would start light.
[17:31.420 --> 17:32.920]  See if it's washing off the PM.
[17:32.920 --> 17:34.100]  See if it's solving the problem.
[17:34.100 --> 17:35.420]  If not, go harder.
[17:35.420 --> 17:38.620]  Go harder until you see it start doing some damage to a couple branches.
[17:38.620 --> 17:40.900]  Then dilute as necessary.
[17:40.900 --> 17:44.820]  Usually 25 to 50 mils of 30% hydrogen peroxide.
[17:44.820 --> 17:45.820]  Not the cheap shit.
[17:45.820 --> 17:46.820]  You need the good stuff.
[17:46.820 --> 17:49.500]  The 30%, the medical grade, the good shit.
[17:49.820 --> 17:53.780]  25 to 30 mils and a five gallon bucket of water.
[17:53.780 --> 17:55.740]  Wear your protective equipment.
[17:55.740 --> 17:57.780]  When you're mixing this, wear goggles.
[17:57.780 --> 18:03.920]  When you're handling all of this, wear gloves because that 30% hydrogen peroxide will mess
[18:03.920 --> 18:04.920]  your skin up.
[18:04.920 --> 18:05.940]  It is very caustic.
[18:05.940 --> 18:10.740]  If it gets in your eye, it's going to be one of the most painful things you will ever experience.
[18:10.740 --> 18:16.080]  So please, when you are using the hydrogen peroxide, please use at least the gloves and
[18:16.080 --> 18:18.060]  I recommend some goggles when you're pouring it.
[18:18.060 --> 18:22.380]  I understand a lot of people aren't going to go get goggles just to pour some shit.
[18:22.380 --> 18:23.380]  Enter at your own risk.
[18:23.380 --> 18:25.340]  Rasta Jeff is making a disclaimer.
[18:25.340 --> 18:27.260]  Don't fucking sue me because you're dumb.
[18:27.260 --> 18:28.260]  All right.
[18:28.260 --> 18:29.260]  Enough said there.
[18:29.260 --> 18:33.500]  A five gallon bucket, 25 to 50 mils of hydrogen peroxide, the good shit.
[18:33.500 --> 18:34.500]  30%.
[18:34.500 --> 18:37.900]  You can go harder if you want, but don't blame me if that fucks up your buds.
[18:37.900 --> 18:39.700]  Start low and then work your way up.
[18:39.700 --> 18:42.060]  If it's not taking off the mildew, add more.
[18:42.060 --> 18:45.500]  When it starts bleaching your buds, you've gone too far, dilute.
[18:45.500 --> 18:46.500]  You'll figure it out.
[18:46.500 --> 18:47.500]  You'll pick up two branches and you'll notice.
[18:47.500 --> 18:48.500]  All right.
[18:48.500 --> 18:51.020]  So we've got our five gallon bucket filled with our solution.
[18:51.020 --> 18:54.420]  You don't have to use the hydrogen peroxide, but that is what I recommend.
[18:54.420 --> 18:57.160]  If we're going to do this, that is something I would recommend.
[18:57.160 --> 18:58.860]  I don't think it will damage your plants.
[18:58.860 --> 19:00.780]  I don't think it will mess anything up.
[19:00.780 --> 19:05.780]  I've applied hydrogen peroxide as a full year spray before to combat powdery mildew.
[19:05.780 --> 19:08.620]  And in my opinion, it works very, very well.
[19:08.620 --> 19:10.300]  It leaves the gross smelling clean and fresh.
[19:10.300 --> 19:13.980]  And the next day you don't even notice it happened, except there's no powdery mildew
[19:13.980 --> 19:17.460]  and the plants are happier and it smells amazing like ganja in that room.
[19:17.460 --> 19:19.300]  So we've got our five gallon bucket.
[19:19.300 --> 19:20.860]  We've got our hydrogen peroxide in there.
[19:20.860 --> 19:22.180]  We've got our gloves on.
[19:22.180 --> 19:24.700]  Maybe some of you are wearing eye gear.
[19:24.700 --> 19:25.700]  Probably not.
[19:25.700 --> 19:30.460]  We're going to cut our plant into manageable sections, probably 10 to 12 inch sections.
[19:30.460 --> 19:33.860]  Something like that is probably manageable for most people.
[19:33.860 --> 19:38.540]  Before we even start dunking these buds, have a place where they are going to hang.
[19:38.540 --> 19:39.900]  Where are they going to go?
[19:39.900 --> 19:42.460]  Once you dunk these buds, you're going to dunk them into water.
[19:42.460 --> 19:43.540]  You're going to swirl them around.
[19:44.100 --> 19:45.100]  You're going to take them out.
[19:45.100 --> 19:47.060]  We've got to hang them somewhere for them to drip dry.
[19:47.060 --> 19:49.260]  They're going to have a lot of water in there.
[19:49.260 --> 19:53.340]  Depending on how spongy and dense your buds are and how much bud is on that stick, there's
[19:53.340 --> 19:55.820]  going to be quite a bit of water left in there.
[19:55.820 --> 19:56.820]  It will come out.
[19:56.820 --> 19:57.820]  Don't worry.
[19:57.820 --> 19:58.820]  Don't squeeze it.
[19:58.820 --> 20:00.540]  Don't do anything fucking crazy to it.
[20:00.540 --> 20:01.540]  Let it drip out.
[20:01.540 --> 20:04.140]  Let it just come out naturally.
[20:04.140 --> 20:08.220]  So have that space in mind, have it planned, have it ready.
[20:08.220 --> 20:12.220]  Maybe already know exactly how much space you need to hang these plants before you even
[20:12.220 --> 20:16.340]  get to this point because I don't want you to have wet buds and a struggle.
[20:16.340 --> 20:17.860]  That's when you're going to cause problems.
[20:17.860 --> 20:19.640]  If you don't, fuck it up.
[20:19.640 --> 20:20.700]  This will go very well.
[20:20.700 --> 20:25.780]  But if you don't have a proper strategy and a place to put the buds before you dunk them,
[20:25.780 --> 20:26.820]  shit will go wrong.
[20:26.820 --> 20:27.820]  I promise.
[20:27.820 --> 20:29.740]  We can't stack up wet buds.
[20:29.740 --> 20:32.900]  They've got to be hung with space, with care.
[20:32.900 --> 20:35.900]  So have a place for them to go.
[20:35.900 --> 20:38.360]  Have the product, your solution ready.
[20:38.360 --> 20:39.980]  Have your protective equipment on.
[20:39.980 --> 20:41.700]  Cut the buds into manageable pieces.
[20:42.180 --> 20:43.820]  Now, here's where we're going to get crazy.
[20:43.820 --> 20:45.740]  You got a five gallon bucket, right?
[20:45.740 --> 20:49.660]  Take your piece of bud, your branch, your stalk, however much product you've got, and
[20:49.660 --> 20:51.620]  just submerge it right into the water.
[20:51.620 --> 20:53.220]  I know this sounds brave.
[20:53.220 --> 20:54.420]  I know this sounds crazy.
[20:54.420 --> 20:56.340]  You just put months into this product.
[20:56.340 --> 20:59.980]  But I have done entire harvests in commercial facilities this way.
[20:59.980 --> 21:04.900]  I've paid guys to spend all day washing buds with hydrogen peroxide because we couldn't
[21:04.900 --> 21:07.660]  rescue this facility that was coated in powdery mildew.
[21:07.660 --> 21:08.660]  And that was our solution.
[21:08.660 --> 21:10.020]  It all got made into extracts.
[21:10.020 --> 21:11.020]  It was all tested.
[21:11.340 --> 21:12.340]  It was all safe.
[21:12.340 --> 21:13.340]  It all worked.
[21:13.340 --> 21:14.340]  I trust this method.
[21:14.340 --> 21:19.220]  So we're going to dunk our buds directly into the five gallon bucket with our hydrogen peroxide
[21:19.220 --> 21:20.580]  solution.
[21:20.580 --> 21:22.500]  While it's in there, jostle it.
[21:22.500 --> 21:24.260]  The word that I want to use is jostle.
[21:24.260 --> 21:25.820]  Stir the buds around.
[21:25.820 --> 21:27.860]  Don't get in there and fucking...
[21:27.860 --> 21:30.020]  We're not trying to shake the trichomes off.
[21:30.020 --> 21:32.100]  We're trying to jostle the powdery mildew off.
[21:32.100 --> 21:33.500]  We don't want to disrupt the plant.
[21:33.500 --> 21:35.060]  We just want to rinse it.
[21:35.060 --> 21:38.140]  Just not vigorous, but not lily dipping.
[21:38.140 --> 21:41.460]  But you want to get in there and kind of just in and out and swish it around a little
[21:41.460 --> 21:42.460]  bit.
[21:42.460 --> 21:43.460]  Just get some movement.
[21:43.460 --> 21:45.780]  It gets a little bit of friction in there.
[21:45.780 --> 21:47.260]  Just wash that powdery mildew off.
[21:47.260 --> 21:50.260]  Then take that plant out and give it a visual assessment.
[21:50.260 --> 21:51.260]  Look at it.
[21:51.260 --> 21:52.700]  Do you see more problems?
[21:52.700 --> 21:54.140]  Did bug poop come off of it?
[21:54.140 --> 21:55.740]  Did the spider web come off of it?
[21:55.740 --> 21:57.100]  Did the bird shit come off?
[21:57.100 --> 21:58.660]  Did the powdery mildew wash off?
[21:58.660 --> 21:59.820]  Did you do a good enough job?
[21:59.820 --> 22:03.860]  If not, dunk that fucker back in there and give it another wiggle, another jiggle, another
[22:03.860 --> 22:04.860]  jostle.
[22:04.860 --> 22:06.780]  Do what you need to do until it's clean.
[22:06.780 --> 22:08.220]  Bring it up.
[22:08.220 --> 22:09.900]  Repeat as necessary.
[22:09.900 --> 22:13.220]  Maybe do a portion of the crop at this point.
[22:13.220 --> 22:16.460]  Maybe just do some of it and see how you like this method.
[22:16.460 --> 22:17.460]  Check on those plants.
[22:17.460 --> 22:18.620]  Check on them in an hour.
[22:18.620 --> 22:21.700]  Check on them in two, four, six, every few hours.
[22:21.700 --> 22:22.700]  Just check on them.
[22:22.700 --> 22:24.920]  See what is happening before you do the whole crop.
[22:24.920 --> 22:25.920]  Check on them.
[22:25.920 --> 22:27.180]  See if you like how it is going.
[22:27.180 --> 22:28.380]  See if you dunk them enough.
[22:28.380 --> 22:30.420]  Is there still stuff on there you want to wash off?
[22:30.420 --> 22:32.780]  If there is, you can.
[22:32.780 --> 22:38.100]  But it is very important that you dunk them and wash them before the plants begin to dry.
[22:38.100 --> 22:44.260]  Do not, do not take a dry plant and try to dunk it and re-moisten it and do this.
[22:44.260 --> 22:45.580]  You will destroy everything.
[22:45.580 --> 22:46.740]  You'll fuck it all up.
[22:46.740 --> 22:48.260]  You'll be so mad.
[22:48.260 --> 22:51.520]  So that's a quick disclaimer, a quick reminder, a quick notice.
[22:51.520 --> 22:55.900]  Do not try to re-moisten and do this to a dried plant.
[22:55.900 --> 22:57.060]  You can't do that.
[22:57.060 --> 22:58.260]  That's going to be a total failure.
[22:58.260 --> 23:02.200]  So take your wet plant, dunk it, shake it, jostle it around, hang it up.
[23:02.200 --> 23:06.320]  If you like how that one came out in a couple of hours, do the rest of the plants.
[23:06.320 --> 23:07.320]  Dunk them all.
[23:07.320 --> 23:11.440]  Dunk them, jostle them, give them a little swish, watch the powdery mildew come on up.
[23:11.440 --> 23:14.840]  Now eventually that water is going to start looking a little bit funky.
[23:14.840 --> 23:17.560]  At your own discretion, dump that shit out, start fresh.
[23:17.560 --> 23:20.640]  The hydrogen peroxide is not super expensive.
[23:20.640 --> 23:22.120]  You've gotten this far with it.
[23:22.120 --> 23:24.800]  Hopefully it's working for you and it is cost effective.
[23:24.800 --> 23:27.240]  But feel free to dump that shit out and start fresh.
[23:27.240 --> 23:30.760]  Let me check my notes, make sure I'm on pace.
[23:30.760 --> 23:32.160]  Replace the water as necessary.
[23:32.160 --> 23:35.880]  You'll start seeing powdery mildew on the top or you'll start seeing it'll get grimy
[23:35.880 --> 23:36.880]  and gross.
[23:36.880 --> 23:37.880]  You'll know.
[23:37.880 --> 23:38.880]  You'll feel, you'll just have a feeling.
[23:38.880 --> 23:39.880]  That's gross.
[23:39.880 --> 23:40.880]  I should change it.
[23:40.880 --> 23:41.880]  Change it.
[23:41.880 --> 23:42.880]  Don't be afraid.
[23:42.880 --> 23:43.880]  Hang the buds.
[23:43.880 --> 23:45.240]  So hang them where they can drip dry.
[23:45.240 --> 23:49.560]  I would hang them somewhere with an ambient environment.
[23:49.560 --> 23:54.160]  I know that wherever, like just ambient, you don't need extreme heat, extreme cold, normal
[23:54.160 --> 23:55.560]  ambient environment.
[23:55.560 --> 23:59.920]  Somewhere between 65 and 75 degrees would be cool, would be ideal.
[23:59.920 --> 24:03.360]  But right now I'm going to give you up to 82-ish degrees because it's hotter than shit
[24:03.360 --> 24:04.360]  everywhere.
[24:04.360 --> 24:06.620]  And it's going to be hard to find a cool space like that.
[24:06.620 --> 24:09.420]  So if you get a cool dry space, that would be ideal.
[24:09.420 --> 24:11.280]  Let them drip dry.
[24:11.280 --> 24:14.440]  There's going to be a lot of water falling out of these buds onto the floor.
[24:14.440 --> 24:15.840]  Be prepared for that.
[24:15.840 --> 24:16.940]  Maybe do it outside.
[24:16.940 --> 24:18.580]  Maybe do it in the garage.
[24:18.580 --> 24:21.760]  Then once they're done dripping and they're no longer dripping, then you can move them
[24:21.760 --> 24:28.160]  to your regular drying space and you can begin your drying process as normal.
[24:28.160 --> 24:36.240]  For the normal drying space, that's when I would have 55-65% humidity, maybe 50% humidity
[24:36.240 --> 24:38.280]  since the plants are so wet.
[24:38.280 --> 24:42.920]  Maybe start off at 50 and then let it go up over the next day up to 55-65.
[24:42.920 --> 24:50.640]  But 50-65% humidity, then 65-75 degrees in that room if you can manage that.
[24:50.640 --> 24:52.720]  I understand it's hot as shit.
[24:52.720 --> 24:55.880]  Right now I'd probably have to have an 80 degree drying space just because that's how
[24:55.880 --> 24:57.280]  it is.
[24:57.400 --> 25:00.840]  We can't always have all the perfect shit.
[25:00.840 --> 25:02.280]  Have a fan in there.
[25:02.280 --> 25:08.480]  Have fans moving the air so none of the air is stagnant, but don't have fans directly
[25:08.480 --> 25:10.960]  blowing onto the plants, speed drying them.
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.080]  So if you can have an oscillating fan that just goes across the plants occasionally,
[25:15.080 --> 25:16.080]  that's okay.
[25:16.080 --> 25:20.520]  Have air movement in the room, but don't blow onto the plants because that'll cause dryness
[25:20.520 --> 25:21.520]  that we don't want.
[25:21.520 --> 25:25.200]  That'll dry one section fast and the others won't be dry evenly.
[25:25.200 --> 25:27.400]  That'll start causing you problems.
[25:27.400 --> 25:32.320]  So at this point, basically dry your plants like you normally would.
[25:32.320 --> 25:34.040]  Proceed with caution.
[25:34.040 --> 25:35.840]  Keep an eye on the plants.
[25:35.840 --> 25:37.280]  Don't let the room get too humid.
[25:37.280 --> 25:42.600]  You may need to step up your dehumidifier or your extraction fan.
[25:42.600 --> 25:46.520]  However your drying and curing space is set up, don't let it get too humid in there.
[25:46.520 --> 25:49.340]  That's something that is very important at this time.
[25:49.340 --> 25:50.340]  Have that room dialed in.
[25:50.340 --> 25:54.480]  Have a way to get rid of the excess humidity because we did soak these buds in water and
[25:54.480 --> 25:58.840]  then we put them, hopefully let them drip long enough, but there's a lot of water in
[25:58.840 --> 25:59.840]  there.
[25:59.840 --> 26:01.280]  So a lot of that water has to come out.
[26:01.280 --> 26:04.920]  Expect a couple of extra days on your dry time, but that is not a problem.
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.880]  In my opinion, letting cannabis dry longer is a good thing.
[26:08.880 --> 26:11.040]  Some of you guys want it to dry super fast.
[26:11.040 --> 26:12.720]  It's better when it dries slower.
[26:12.720 --> 26:14.360]  A better thing happens.
[26:14.360 --> 26:20.120]  There's a conversion that happens during the drying and cure process that happens better
[26:20.120 --> 26:21.620]  if it goes more slowly.
[26:21.620 --> 26:24.660]  So take your time with the drying and curing process.
[26:24.660 --> 26:27.540]  I will work on an updated drying and curing episode.
[26:27.540 --> 26:29.260]  I know I haven't done that updated episode.
[26:29.260 --> 26:31.420]  There's just an audio only version.
[26:31.420 --> 26:32.980]  We'll get a video version of that coming up.
[26:32.980 --> 26:36.340]  Those episodes take a lot of focus and a lot of work, a lot of time to record, and a lot
[26:36.340 --> 26:38.180]  of perfection in the editing, but we'll get it right.
[26:38.180 --> 26:39.180]  We'll get it out for you.
[26:39.180 --> 26:43.740]  But at this point, I feel like I have gotten you through bud washing.
[26:43.740 --> 26:45.220]  It's not as scary as it sounds.
[26:45.220 --> 26:47.380]  It's not as intimidating as it sounds.
[26:47.380 --> 26:48.780]  It's not as nasty as it sounds.
[26:48.780 --> 26:53.980]  If you're taking a bucket with some hydrogen peroxide, you can use H2O2 if you've got that
[26:53.980 --> 26:54.980]  available.
[26:54.980 --> 26:58.460]  Once again, be just as careful, if not more careful, with the H2O2.
[26:58.460 --> 26:59.460]  It's just as caustic.
[26:59.460 --> 27:00.460]  It'll burn.
[27:00.460 --> 27:01.460]  It'll fuck you up.
[27:01.460 --> 27:02.460]  It's dangerous.
[27:02.460 --> 27:03.460]  Use your personal protective equipment.
[27:03.460 --> 27:04.460]  Don't sue me if you fuck up.
[27:04.460 --> 27:09.460]  Also, if you get caught doing anything illegal involving this plant, this culture, this scene,
[27:09.460 --> 27:10.940]  I will not be held responsible.
[27:10.940 --> 27:14.460]  Rasta Jeff is a fictional character, and this is a show for entertainment purposes.
[27:14.460 --> 27:16.220]  But mix up your solution.
[27:16.220 --> 27:17.220]  Dunk that shit in there.
[27:17.220 --> 27:18.220]  Give it a swirl.
[27:18.220 --> 27:21.060]  Then, you can pick it up, and don't let it get moldy because it's too wet.
[27:21.060 --> 27:22.180]  Don't speed dry it.
[27:22.180 --> 27:24.360]  That is the gist of bud washing.
[27:24.360 --> 27:25.860]  Think about why you're doing it.
[27:25.860 --> 27:30.340]  A lot of extractors have started bud washing, even if there is not a problem in the grow.
[27:30.340 --> 27:32.700]  They find that the grow spaces are dusty.
[27:32.700 --> 27:37.720]  Where I live, this town experienced ... There's a documentary called The Dust Bowl.
[27:37.720 --> 27:39.620]  This town was part of The Dust Bowl.
[27:39.620 --> 27:42.240]  This town where I live gets dusty.
[27:42.240 --> 27:43.300]  There's desert that way.
[27:43.300 --> 27:44.580]  There's desert that way.
[27:44.580 --> 27:49.260]  There's a steel mill that way that produces all kinds of weird, dusty shit.
[27:49.260 --> 27:50.900]  We have to dust here constantly.
[27:50.900 --> 27:53.100]  If you dust the shelves, you dust Monday.
[27:53.100 --> 27:54.820]  You're probably dusting again Thursday.
[27:54.820 --> 27:57.180]  If you don't, it builds up a funky gunk of dust.
[27:57.180 --> 27:58.580]  It is dusty here.
[27:58.580 --> 28:00.440]  All that shit's on our plants as well.
[28:00.440 --> 28:02.220]  My table is not very sticky.
[28:02.220 --> 28:04.700]  It's kind of sticky because I take some dabs here.
[28:04.700 --> 28:08.680]  The table's not naturally really sticky, and it gets dusty and funky.
[28:08.680 --> 28:13.380]  Our cannabis plants, if you're doing it right, they're sticky as shit, especially outside.
[28:13.380 --> 28:17.580]  You're going to get all of that dust from the desert that we've got, all of that weird
[28:17.580 --> 28:21.820]  shit floating around from the wind, all of that stuff from the steel mill, all the brake
[28:21.820 --> 28:22.820]  dust.
[28:22.820 --> 28:25.340]  If you live by the interstate and you've got to grow by the interstate, there's a lot of
[28:25.340 --> 28:26.420]  brake dust in the air.
[28:26.420 --> 28:28.100]  All of that shit will be stuck to your plants.
[28:28.100 --> 28:29.620]  We don't think about that.
[28:29.620 --> 28:33.300]  That's a very good, logical, rational reason to do a little bit of bud washing.
[28:33.300 --> 28:37.300]  Then when you start rinsing those plants and you see what's left in the water, you'll be
[28:37.300 --> 28:40.900]  a little bit disgusted that you haven't thought about doing it before.
[28:40.900 --> 28:42.140]  We're making extracts.
[28:42.140 --> 28:43.260]  We're making food.
[28:44.140 --> 28:45.140]  We're smoking these products.
[28:45.140 --> 28:46.140]  Imagine it.
[28:46.140 --> 28:47.740]  Would you want to smoke a bunch of dirt?
[28:47.740 --> 28:49.620]  Would you want to smoke a nice hit of bird shit?
[28:49.620 --> 28:50.620]  You down, bro?
[28:50.620 --> 28:52.620]  Hey, bro, I got a big bag of bird turd.
[28:52.620 --> 28:53.980]  You want to take a hit off of this?
[28:53.980 --> 28:55.900]  That doesn't sound appealing to me.
[28:55.900 --> 28:56.900]  Don't be afraid.
[28:56.900 --> 28:58.100]  Don't be scared to wash your buds.
[28:58.100 --> 28:59.900]  Don't be ashamed of it either.
[28:59.900 --> 29:03.340]  We put a lot of work and a lot of energy into our grow.
[29:03.340 --> 29:04.820]  Sometimes you have to have something to show for it.
[29:04.820 --> 29:07.140]  A lot of you, this is your medicine for the year.
[29:07.140 --> 29:08.760]  This is what is going to get you by.
[29:08.760 --> 29:12.580]  This is what's going to make you not super sick from whatever ails you.
[29:12.900 --> 29:15.740]  I don't want to pin you with some sort of condition, but this may be what is saving
[29:15.740 --> 29:17.500]  your life for the next year.
[29:17.500 --> 29:18.700]  Let's do what we can to save it.
[29:18.700 --> 29:19.700]  Let's be proud about it.
[29:19.700 --> 29:20.780]  Let's be safe.
[29:20.780 --> 29:25.420]  Let's be as clean and conscious about it as we can as well.
[29:25.420 --> 29:29.860]  Keep in mind, prevention is key, but right now at the outdoor season that I saw, there
[29:29.860 --> 29:33.460]  was a lot of powdery mildew and there were not a lot of ways to prevent it because we
[29:33.460 --> 29:35.380]  cannot control the VPD outdoors.
[29:35.380 --> 29:36.780]  You can apply a few things.
[29:36.780 --> 29:37.980]  I do like cease.
[29:37.980 --> 29:39.340]  I like zero tall.
[29:39.340 --> 29:41.780]  I like double nickel.
[29:41.780 --> 29:44.980]  What's the one from Maroon Bio Innovations?
[29:44.980 --> 29:45.980]  They've got a couple.
[29:45.980 --> 29:46.980]  Maybe it's Grandivo.
[29:46.980 --> 29:51.620]  There's a lot of great products that we can spray that work as a preventative or it will
[29:51.620 --> 29:55.860]  help remove an eradicator of the powdery mildew, but I understand.
[29:55.860 --> 29:57.620]  Sometimes shit gets away from you.
[29:57.620 --> 30:00.700]  If you're fighting the powdery mildew now, you can spray with cease.
[30:00.700 --> 30:02.540]  You can spray with double nickel.
[30:02.540 --> 30:08.300]  Then when it comes time to harvest, do that dunk in either zero tall or hydrogen peroxide.
[30:08.820 --> 30:11.820]  Heavy defoliation will help you with powdery mildew.
[30:11.820 --> 30:16.020]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes, friends, foes, smokers, growers,
[30:16.020 --> 30:22.140]  clone cutters, pollen chuckers, spinners, guys that stand there, chompers and tapers,
[30:22.140 --> 30:25.300]  I want to thank each and every one of you for hanging out, listening to another episode
[30:25.300 --> 30:27.140]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[30:27.140 --> 30:29.580]  I forgot the name of my own show for a moment there.
[30:29.580 --> 30:30.580]  This was a good time.
[30:30.580 --> 30:31.580]  I had a great time.
[30:31.580 --> 30:32.780]  I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[30:32.780 --> 30:33.860]  I hope I helped you out.
[30:33.860 --> 30:35.580]  I hope I rescued your outdoor harvest.
[30:35.580 --> 30:39.460]  I really hope you don't have a powdery mildew problem, but if you do, maybe we'll get you
[30:39.460 --> 30:40.460]  through it.
[30:40.460 --> 30:41.460]  We'll get through it together.
[30:41.460 --> 30:42.580]  Again, don't be ashamed.
[30:42.580 --> 30:43.780]  Don't be embarrassed.
[30:43.780 --> 30:45.420]  Shit happens, especially outdoors.
[30:45.420 --> 30:46.460]  You guys, that is going to happen.
[30:46.460 --> 30:49.820]  If it's indoors, we've got to correct some issues.
[30:49.820 --> 30:54.720]  That's a whole other conversation, a whole another podcast, but don't ever be ashamed.
[30:54.720 --> 30:55.720]  Don't be fearful.
[30:55.720 --> 30:59.220]  Don't be scared that you had or have a problem in your grow.
[30:59.220 --> 31:00.260]  That's how we learn the most.
[31:00.260 --> 31:03.140]  If it went perfect every time, just be perfect every time.
[31:03.300 --> 31:05.700]  When a problem came up, you wouldn't know what to do with it.
[31:05.700 --> 31:06.700]  Guess what?
[31:06.700 --> 31:08.740]  Now, we know what to do with powdery mildew.
[31:08.740 --> 31:10.540]  All right, I've been rambling for a long time.
[31:10.540 --> 31:12.420]  Thanks again for hanging out, you guys.
[31:12.420 --> 31:15.300]  If you have any questions, corrections, comments, or concerns, you know how to reach me.
[31:15.300 --> 31:18.860]  The email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[31:18.860 --> 31:19.860]  Don't be shy.
[31:19.860 --> 31:22.780]  Send me some questions, corrections, comments, concerns, updates.
[31:22.780 --> 31:24.460]  I do love the harassment.
[31:24.460 --> 31:25.580]  I look forward to it.
[31:25.580 --> 31:27.820]  Speaking of harassment, find us on Discord.
[31:27.820 --> 31:29.900]  There's a link in the show notes and the video description.
[31:29.900 --> 31:33.460]  If I'm paying attention enough when I edit, the link is right here as well.
[31:33.460 --> 31:36.580]  You won't be able to click it, but you can read it and you can type it right on in.
[31:36.580 --> 31:37.580]  It's right there.
[31:37.580 --> 31:39.700]  Yeah, Discord, GG, some other stuff.
[31:39.700 --> 31:40.700]  It goes right here.
[31:40.700 --> 31:41.700]  We'll put it there.
[31:41.700 --> 31:42.700]  All right.
[31:42.700 --> 31:44.260]  Also, the website.
[31:44.260 --> 31:45.700]  Everything is at the website.
[31:45.700 --> 31:49.220]  Everything iRegenetics, everything iReArmy, everything Grow From Your Heart is at the
[31:49.220 --> 31:50.540]  website.
[31:50.540 --> 31:53.100]  Contact information, a link to the Discord.
[31:53.100 --> 31:56.020]  If you don't want to type in all those links, go to the iRegenetics website.
[31:56.020 --> 31:57.660]  There's a link to the Discord.
[31:57.660 --> 32:00.500]  There's a link to the Etsy store where you can get some fresh new gear.
[32:00.500 --> 32:01.500]  That's right.
[32:01.500 --> 32:03.500]  There's a new coffee mug up with my face on it.
[32:03.500 --> 32:05.060]  There will be new shirts going up soon.
[32:05.060 --> 32:07.380]  There's some brand new merchandise that arrived today.
[32:07.380 --> 32:10.940]  Then when I do get a moment, I will put that on the Etsy store.
[32:10.940 --> 32:11.940]  Stay tuned.
[32:11.940 --> 32:13.660]  Keep checking because there's new shit coming.
[32:13.660 --> 32:18.500]  Also, on that website, there is a tab that says, Stay Up To Date.
[32:18.500 --> 32:22.860]  If you type in your email address, you will get a newsletter approximately once a month,
[32:22.860 --> 32:25.620]  maybe every two weeks, and lets you know what's going on with iRegenetics.
[32:25.620 --> 32:28.700]  It will let you know about that new merchandise I talked about.
[32:28.700 --> 32:29.980]  It will let you know about coupon codes.
[32:29.980 --> 32:34.260]  It will let you know about seed drops and restocks, events, and updates.
[32:34.260 --> 32:37.820]  We will have an update on an event here on the next episode, so do stay tuned for that.
[32:37.820 --> 32:42.020]  But make sure you check out the iRegenetics website and sign up for the newsletter so
[32:42.020 --> 32:44.320]  I can send you a newsletter once a month.
[32:44.320 --> 32:46.460]  That is all I've got for you for this episode.
[32:46.460 --> 32:49.220]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[32:49.220 --> 32:52.020]  Let's send a big shout out to my buddy, Rasta Green Thumb.
[32:52.020 --> 32:56.100]  Until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
