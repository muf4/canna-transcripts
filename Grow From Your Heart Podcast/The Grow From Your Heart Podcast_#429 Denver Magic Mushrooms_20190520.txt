[00:00.000 --> 00:02.400]  All right, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:02.400 --> 00:04.400]  It is time for episode 429
[00:04.400 --> 00:06.280]  of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:06.280 --> 00:08.520]  Sitting across the table from me is White Mike.
[00:08.520 --> 00:09.640]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:09.640 --> 00:10.480]  Thanks, man.
[00:10.480 --> 00:11.320]  What's up, everybody?
[00:11.320 --> 00:13.220]  Thanks for coming and hanging out on this special episode
[00:13.220 --> 00:14.520]  of the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[00:14.520 --> 00:15.440]  It's good to have you.
[00:15.440 --> 00:16.280]  Yeah, man.
[00:16.280 --> 00:17.640]  I said special episode, and you looked at me like,
[00:17.640 --> 00:18.480]  why is it special?
[00:18.480 --> 00:19.300]  Why is it special?
[00:19.300 --> 00:20.140]  Well, because we're gonna talk about
[00:20.140 --> 00:22.600]  a sorta not so regular subject for the show.
[00:22.600 --> 00:24.300]  We'll get into that here in just a minute.
[00:24.300 --> 00:25.580]  This show, as always, is brought to you
[00:25.580 --> 00:27.440]  by our friends at Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:27.440 --> 00:29.120]  That's right, if you need new seeds in your garden,
[00:29.120 --> 00:31.320]  I highly recommend Oregon Elite Seeds.
[00:31.320 --> 00:36.320]  You can find them at www.oregoneliteseeds.com.
[00:36.800 --> 00:38.140]  Check them out, get yourself some fresh,
[00:38.140 --> 00:40.380]  new genetics in the grow.
[00:40.380 --> 00:42.000]  Usually, we like to start the podcast off
[00:42.000 --> 00:43.440]  by talking about what we are dabbing.
[00:43.440 --> 00:45.540]  We have been dabbing some of this buffet over here
[00:45.540 --> 00:47.460]  from our friends at Apothecary Farms.
[00:47.460 --> 00:48.900]  No, buffet is not a strain.
[00:48.900 --> 00:52.040]  I have got a buffet of concentrates on the table here.
[00:52.040 --> 00:53.920]  We just recently, our most recent dab
[00:53.920 --> 00:56.440]  was Malibu Pyrrhicush Ambrosia
[00:56.440 --> 01:00.580]  mixed with Malibu Pyrrhicush Full Spectrum Extract.
[01:00.580 --> 01:04.120]  One of these labels says 82.1% total cannabinoids.
[01:04.120 --> 01:08.120]  The other one says 98% total cannabinoids.
[01:08.120 --> 01:08.960]  That's why Mike looks pale over there.
[01:08.960 --> 01:10.400]  That's why my bell's ringing.
[01:10.400 --> 01:11.760]  Yeah, that's why Mike is nice and quiet.
[01:11.760 --> 01:14.160]  That's why Mike coughed for about 20 minutes over there.
[01:14.160 --> 01:15.400]  No, that was the heat of the nail.
[01:15.400 --> 01:17.260]  Okay, yeah, well, we're doing these insert dabs now,
[01:17.260 --> 01:19.320]  and you went in like four good pulls on that thing.
[01:19.320 --> 01:21.920]  The insert dab helps with the temp control,
[01:21.920 --> 01:24.000]  which was a lot easier on my lungs,
[01:24.000 --> 01:26.240]  so shout out to the insert dab.
[01:27.040 --> 01:27.960]  I think it may have backfired on you.
[01:27.960 --> 01:29.400]  I think you thought you were gonna go in
[01:29.400 --> 01:30.760]  and take that third and fourth pull
[01:30.760 --> 01:31.640]  because it was nice and cool,
[01:31.640 --> 01:33.200]  and then on that fourth one, I saw you do the,
[01:33.200 --> 01:35.240]  oh, God, like you realized,
[01:35.240 --> 01:37.560]  I just got too close to the sun over here.
[01:37.560 --> 01:38.520]  It's all right.
[01:38.520 --> 01:39.760]  You're back, welcome to the show.
[01:39.760 --> 01:41.040]  The sweats have subsided.
[01:41.880 --> 01:43.160]  Man, I'm- We're ready to roll.
[01:43.160 --> 01:44.800]  I know people hate talking about the weather,
[01:44.800 --> 01:46.240]  but it just switched from like,
[01:46.240 --> 01:47.720]  I need a hoodie and some pants to,
[01:47.720 --> 01:49.720]  bro, we need some shorts and flip flops out here
[01:49.720 --> 01:51.360]  real quick around here in Colorado.
[01:51.360 --> 01:55.480]  Yep, Colorado, they say don't plant until after Mother's Day
[01:55.480 --> 01:59.080]  and this year, that rule proved fucking super true.
[01:59.080 --> 02:01.240]  Yeah, we got snow like two days before
[02:01.240 --> 02:02.920]  and then it was super warm on Mother's Day.
[02:02.920 --> 02:04.240]  It has been every type of weather
[02:04.240 --> 02:05.080]  you could imagine this month.
[02:05.080 --> 02:06.640]  But now it's just fucking gorgeous.
[02:06.640 --> 02:08.040]  Yeah, it was super, it was hot today,
[02:08.040 --> 02:09.720]  but now it is gorgeous this evening.
[02:09.720 --> 02:11.760]  What I was saying is it is time to start getting
[02:11.760 --> 02:15.400]  the air conditioners and the winter time equipment prepared
[02:15.400 --> 02:17.160]  if you haven't done so already.
[02:17.160 --> 02:18.840]  Change the filters in the air conditioners.
[02:18.840 --> 02:21.280]  Maybe it's time to upgrade some of your blowers
[02:21.280 --> 02:22.520]  and exhaust fans.
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.240]  Fans in the room don't create cool air.
[02:26.000 --> 02:28.200]  Fans in the room move around heat and humidity.
[02:28.200 --> 02:29.280]  They don't cool anything off.
[02:29.280 --> 02:30.760]  So you gotta get some cooling in there.
[02:30.760 --> 02:32.320]  It's time for that sort of stuff in the grow.
[02:32.320 --> 02:33.600]  If you haven't already thought about it,
[02:33.600 --> 02:34.600]  it is time to think about it.
[02:34.600 --> 02:35.920]  Temperatures are going to increase.
[02:35.920 --> 02:38.200]  You're going to start slowing down productivity.
[02:38.200 --> 02:41.360]  Think about cooling it as that time of the year.
[02:41.360 --> 02:42.200]  Indeed.
[02:42.200 --> 02:43.720]  All right, usually at this point in the show,
[02:43.720 --> 02:45.680]  I like to give shout outs to folks
[02:45.680 --> 02:47.760]  who have helped us out on Patreon.
[02:47.760 --> 02:50.240]  So let's give a big shout out to my buddy, Justin.
[02:50.240 --> 02:52.240]  How about a big giant Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:52.240 --> 02:53.960]  Shout out to our buddy, Glenn G.
[02:53.960 --> 02:56.840]  Always a big giant shout out to Darren W.
[02:56.840 --> 02:59.800]  And of course, a big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[02:59.800 --> 03:02.400]  Shout out to our friend, Tanner M.
[03:02.400 --> 03:04.840]  I want to thank everybody for all of the Patreon support.
[03:04.840 --> 03:07.400]  If you'd like to learn how to support the show,
[03:07.400 --> 03:09.000]  that's harder to say than it sounds.
[03:09.000 --> 03:09.840]  Let's try it again.
[03:09.840 --> 03:11.600]  If you would like to learn how to support the show
[03:11.600 --> 03:15.280]  on Patreon, you can do so by going to patreon.com
[03:15.280 --> 03:16.840]  slash growfromyourheart.

[03:18.040 --> 03:19.520]  will be right there on the screen.
[03:19.520 --> 03:21.320]  Help me keep these microphone covers fresh
[03:21.320 --> 03:22.640]  so that Mike doesn't have to spit
[03:22.640 --> 03:24.000]  the same one every time.
[03:24.000 --> 03:26.600]  The Patreon contributions help me keep the website alive,
[03:26.600 --> 03:28.320]  which is where I post the podcast,
[03:28.320 --> 03:31.280]  which helps keep the podcast alive for free for everybody.
[03:31.280 --> 03:33.280]  So the Patreon contributions do help out.
[03:33.280 --> 03:34.120]  They keep the show moving.
[03:34.120 --> 03:35.120]  They keep it alive.
[03:35.120 --> 03:37.600]  When equipment breaks, they help me replace equipment,
[03:37.600 --> 03:38.520]  things like that.
[03:38.520 --> 03:39.360]  It really helps out.
[03:39.360 --> 03:42.880]  So thank you to everybody who has contributed to Patreon.
[03:42.880 --> 03:44.080]  Much appreciated, everybody.
[03:44.080 --> 03:44.920]  Thank you.
[03:44.920 --> 03:45.760]  Thank you, thank you.
[03:45.760 --> 03:46.800]  So at the start of the show,
[03:46.800 --> 03:48.400]  I said it was a special episode.
[03:49.520 --> 03:50.920]  Usually we talk about cannabis.
[03:50.960 --> 03:52.960]  It's cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[03:52.960 --> 03:55.440]  Sometimes I rant for a long time about comedy
[03:55.440 --> 03:57.880]  and comedy shows and other things like that.
[03:57.880 --> 04:01.600]  But this time, let's talk about some recent Colorado news.
[04:01.600 --> 04:03.160]  By now, people know what the fuck I'm talking about
[04:03.160 --> 04:04.800]  because I said recent Colorado news.
[04:04.800 --> 04:08.160]  We are going to talk about the fact that they keep saying,
[04:08.160 --> 04:09.880]  this is the first thing we should talk about.
[04:09.880 --> 04:13.440]  The news articles all keep saying magic mushrooms.
[04:13.440 --> 04:15.920]  Magic mushrooms have been decriminalized.
[04:15.920 --> 04:17.920]  That's the second thing we're going to have to focus on
[04:17.920 --> 04:20.800]  in Denver, and that's another thing we need to highlight.
[04:21.560 --> 04:23.640]  So magic mushrooms have been decriminalized in Denver.
[04:23.640 --> 04:27.320]  Psilocybin mushrooms have been decriminalized in Denver.
[04:27.320 --> 04:29.080]  I don't know if I like that all of the articles
[04:29.080 --> 04:30.400]  are calling them magic mushrooms.
[04:30.400 --> 04:31.920]  They're psilocybin mushrooms, but-
[04:31.920 --> 04:33.480]  I was a little disappointed in that too.
[04:33.480 --> 04:34.640]  It's a little bit unprofessional.
[04:34.640 --> 04:35.640]  It's a little bit childish,
[04:35.640 --> 04:37.840]  but when you're not into the culture
[04:37.840 --> 04:40.400]  and when you're a news article and a news writer
[04:40.400 --> 04:42.000]  and a news source, I guess,
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.800]  magic mushrooms is a really good catchphrase.
[04:43.800 --> 04:46.760]  It looks good on paper and it makes no confusion.
[04:46.760 --> 04:48.440]  People don't think, well, do they mean these kinds
[04:48.440 --> 04:49.360]  or these kinds?
[04:49.360 --> 04:51.160]  They know, like it's magic mushrooms.
[04:51.160 --> 04:52.920]  So that's the first part that gets attention
[04:52.920 --> 04:55.000]  is why are they calling it magic mushrooms?
[04:55.000 --> 04:57.520]  But they have decriminalized magic mushrooms
[04:57.520 --> 04:59.000]  for personal use.
[04:59.000 --> 05:01.360]  They have not yet set possession limits.
[05:01.360 --> 05:02.880]  No, all that's still to come.
[05:02.880 --> 05:04.240]  Okay.
[05:04.240 --> 05:05.800]  The other thing I was going to say is,
[05:05.800 --> 05:06.920]  other than magic mushrooms,
[05:06.920 --> 05:09.040]  that's the first part that gets my attention,
[05:09.040 --> 05:11.280]  legal, they have decriminalized these mushrooms.
[05:11.280 --> 05:12.720]  They are not legal.
[05:12.720 --> 05:15.600]  Yeah, decriminalized is way different than legalized.
[05:15.600 --> 05:18.320]  Do you want to give us a good rant on that difference
[05:18.320 --> 05:20.560]  since you're kind of a legal guy?
[05:20.560 --> 05:25.480]  The biggest differences are decriminalized means,
[05:25.480 --> 05:27.320]  and in this case, it's spelled out
[05:27.320 --> 05:29.280]  in the Denver mushroom law,
[05:29.280 --> 05:32.200]  that it's now a low enforcement priority
[05:32.200 --> 05:33.960]  for a police officer.
[05:35.240 --> 05:38.280]  So for an example, if you get caught jaywalking
[05:38.280 --> 05:41.440]  and the cop realizes that you have a small bag
[05:41.440 --> 05:43.080]  of mushrooms in your pocket,
[05:43.080 --> 05:46.480]  the cop is instructed to care more about the jaywalking.
[05:46.480 --> 05:47.760]  Awesome.
[05:47.800 --> 05:50.080]  And it is, it's a huge step in the right direction,
[05:50.080 --> 05:52.640]  but it's definitely not legalization.
[05:53.680 --> 05:56.160]  If you checked out the comment sections
[05:56.160 --> 05:57.880]  on any of the news stories,
[05:57.880 --> 06:00.680]  80% of the comments assumed
[06:00.680 --> 06:02.480]  that there would be mushroom dispensaries
[06:02.480 --> 06:03.600]  popping up everywhere.
[06:03.600 --> 06:05.120]  That's something I was going to touch on.
[06:05.120 --> 06:09.200]  Or that we would have a big mushroom tourism problem
[06:09.200 --> 06:10.240]  in Denver County,
[06:10.240 --> 06:12.560]  because people would come from the world over
[06:12.560 --> 06:15.200]  to enjoy the world's first mushroom market.
[06:15.200 --> 06:17.880]  And none of that's coming to fruition with this law.
[06:17.880 --> 06:20.800]  Right, this isn't legalization like we have done cannabis.
[06:20.800 --> 06:23.320]  This is decriminalization of personal use.
[06:23.320 --> 06:27.680]  It's still illegal to possess or have or grow,
[06:28.480 --> 06:32.040]  but in just Denver County now,
[06:32.040 --> 06:33.520]  or just the city of Denver rather,
[06:33.520 --> 06:36.840]  that you're allowed to grow, possess,
[06:36.840 --> 06:38.600]  and consume personal amounts
[06:38.600 --> 06:40.240]  in the privacy of your own home.
[06:40.240 --> 06:41.640]  Have they decided,
[06:41.640 --> 06:44.240]  who decides what is a personal amount of mushrooms?
[06:44.280 --> 06:46.000]  The city council of Denver
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.400]  and different elected officials in Denver
[06:49.400 --> 06:50.720]  are all going to have to hammer this out
[06:50.720 --> 06:52.440]  over the next six months.
[06:52.440 --> 06:55.960]  This bill gets signed into law the 16th of May.
[06:55.960 --> 06:58.000]  So just, I think today.
[06:58.000 --> 06:58.840]  It'll be today.
[06:58.840 --> 06:59.680]  Well, it's midnight at this time.
[06:59.680 --> 07:02.680]  So it'll be Thursday if we want to be technical.
[07:02.680 --> 07:05.840]  Okay, so let's rewind on a couple of things there.
[07:05.840 --> 07:07.120]  It is not legal.
[07:07.120 --> 07:08.080]  It is decriminalized.
[07:08.080 --> 07:08.920]  So if you get caught,
[07:08.920 --> 07:11.000]  if you were happen to be walking in Denver,
[07:11.000 --> 07:11.840]  you get caught,
[07:11.840 --> 07:13.200]  you get caught for jaywalking or whatever,
[07:13.200 --> 07:14.040]  and you've got some mushrooms,
[07:14.840 --> 07:15.680]  you get pulled over for speeding
[07:15.680 --> 07:16.880]  and you got your mushrooms in your backpack.
[07:16.880 --> 07:17.800]  As long as they're in your backpack
[07:17.800 --> 07:19.400]  and you weren't tripping,
[07:19.400 --> 07:22.040]  it's not a problem to have your mushrooms now.
[07:22.040 --> 07:23.320]  So you can have your mushrooms.
[07:23.320 --> 07:24.880]  That's not illegal.
[07:24.880 --> 07:27.600]  Small possession, personal use.
[07:27.600 --> 07:28.720]  They have to find out,
[07:28.720 --> 07:30.640]  they have to decide what we consider
[07:30.640 --> 07:32.200]  personal possession now.
[07:32.200 --> 07:34.480]  They have to decide what we can cultivate now.
[07:34.480 --> 07:35.880]  That is going to be a fun process,
[07:35.880 --> 07:37.880]  watching Denver try to figure that out.
[07:37.880 --> 07:39.000]  That's always fun.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.560]  Well, it's going to be interesting
[07:41.560 --> 07:43.480]  to see how and where they come up
[07:43.920 --> 07:45.360]  with some of the info for this.
[07:47.560 --> 07:49.440]  I'm guessing most of this process
[07:49.440 --> 07:51.240]  will involve people that were involved
[07:51.240 --> 07:52.960]  with putting this ballot initiative together
[07:52.960 --> 07:53.800]  and passing it.
[07:53.800 --> 07:55.860]  Decriminalize Denver is the group's name.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.400]  I'm hoping they're involved in the laws
[08:00.400 --> 08:01.920]  being crafted as they move forward.
[08:01.920 --> 08:04.720]  Because if we just let Denver City Council
[08:04.720 --> 08:07.840]  decide how much is a reasonable amount of mushrooms
[08:07.840 --> 08:10.160]  to grow for personal use in your own home,
[08:10.160 --> 08:11.200]  the number they come up with
[08:11.200 --> 08:13.160]  is going to be insane one way or the other.
[08:13.840 --> 08:14.680]  It'll be really small.
[08:14.680 --> 08:16.080]  They'd rather go way low than help us out.
[08:16.080 --> 08:18.720]  You're allowed a six inch by six inch plot
[08:18.720 --> 08:21.800]  of mushroom or something.
[08:21.800 --> 08:25.080]  It'll be silly if they don't have stakeholder input.
[08:25.080 --> 08:27.520]  So we're not going to see mushroom dispensaries.
[08:27.520 --> 08:28.360]  That is not a thing.
[08:28.360 --> 08:30.560]  It is decriminalized, it is not legalized,
[08:30.560 --> 08:32.320]  and it is still illegal to sell that.
[08:32.320 --> 08:34.880]  But you can produce your own mushrooms.
[08:34.880 --> 08:36.880]  You can get legally, in most states,
[08:36.880 --> 08:39.640]  you can acquire mushroom spores from the internet.
[08:39.640 --> 08:42.040]  In Colorado, it's legal.
[08:42.080 --> 08:44.240]  All the news reports say that it's perfectly legal
[08:44.240 --> 08:45.920]  to buy spores online in Colorado
[08:45.920 --> 08:47.000]  and have them shipped to your house.
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.200]  So you can get your spores, you can get a small setup.
[08:49.200 --> 08:50.080]  It is really easy to do.
[08:50.080 --> 08:51.720]  I'm not going to teach you how to grow mushrooms.
[08:51.720 --> 08:53.080]  There are plenty of people that have been doing that
[08:53.080 --> 08:54.640]  for 100 years on the internet.
[08:54.640 --> 08:55.920]  Yes, it is all over there.
[08:55.920 --> 08:58.640]  So you can now legally get your spores in Colorado,
[08:58.640 --> 08:59.800]  in Denver, in Denver.
[08:59.800 --> 09:02.640]  That's the next thing I wanted to touch on.
[09:02.640 --> 09:04.360]  Magic mushrooms is a weird word.
[09:04.360 --> 09:05.440]  Legal, no, they're not legal.
[09:05.440 --> 09:06.320]  They're decriminalized.
[09:06.320 --> 09:07.480]  We're not going to have dispensaries.
[09:07.480 --> 09:09.080]  It's not going to be like that.
[09:09.080 --> 09:11.900]  Denver County is the only place that this is illegal.
[09:12.760 --> 09:14.780]  That is a small section of Colorado.
[09:14.780 --> 09:16.300]  So you can get your spores.
[09:16.300 --> 09:19.300]  You can produce your small personal amount of mushrooms.
[09:19.300 --> 09:21.060]  You can harvest them and you can enjoy them.
[09:21.060 --> 09:22.500]  You can possess them.
[09:22.500 --> 09:25.600]  Let's talk about a few things that you cannot do.
[09:25.600 --> 09:29.740]  You cannot take your mushrooms to Red Rocks legally.
[09:29.740 --> 09:30.580]  That is not Denver County.
[09:30.580 --> 09:32.420]  All of the good concert venues in, well, not all.
[09:32.420 --> 09:34.820]  There are several good concert venues in Denver proper,
[09:34.820 --> 09:37.700]  but most of the big ones,
[09:37.700 --> 09:39.620]  the arena that Fish plays at every year,
[09:39.620 --> 09:41.780]  Dick's is not in Denver.
[09:42.620 --> 09:43.460]  Why do you specifically pick Fish?
[09:43.460 --> 09:44.300]  What are you trying to do, bro?
[09:44.300 --> 09:46.380]  Well, no, it's just all the big arenas.
[09:46.380 --> 09:48.220]  Red Rocks, not in Denver.
[09:48.220 --> 09:50.620]  Fiddler's Green, not in Denver.
[09:50.620 --> 09:52.060]  It just leaves the little venues.
[09:52.060 --> 09:54.820]  What county is Fiddler's Green there?
[09:54.820 --> 09:55.660]  Arapaho County?
[09:55.660 --> 09:56.480]  Arapaho.
[09:56.480 --> 09:57.320]  Okay, oh man.
[09:57.320 --> 09:59.700]  So yeah, it just, it really makes a really narrow
[09:59.700 --> 10:01.180]  section of Denver, Denver County,
[10:01.180 --> 10:03.100]  just the middle part there.
[10:03.100 --> 10:04.780]  The Ogden Theater, the Bluebird Theater,
[10:04.780 --> 10:06.540]  the Paramount or the Fillmore.
[10:06.540 --> 10:07.940]  Ogden, Fillmore and Bluebird,
[10:07.940 --> 10:10.140]  I think are the three in Denver.
[10:10.140 --> 10:12.020]  The Paramount, it's on 16th Street there.
[10:12.020 --> 10:12.860]  Yep.
[10:12.860 --> 10:14.020]  The Fillmore.
[10:14.020 --> 10:15.300]  There's a handful.
[10:15.300 --> 10:17.460]  There'll still be some good times to be had though.
[10:17.460 --> 10:20.220]  Plenty, but you're not allowed to consume in public.
[10:20.220 --> 10:23.020]  Public intoxication is still a no-no.
[10:23.020 --> 10:25.300]  Now this is, you just made it take a perfect turn
[10:25.300 --> 10:27.420]  that I kind of wanted to talk about.
[10:27.420 --> 10:29.100]  They've decriminalized something
[10:29.100 --> 10:32.140]  that has never really been an issue before.
[10:32.140 --> 10:34.060]  It doesn't seem like there was a lot of problems
[10:34.060 --> 10:34.900]  involving mushrooms.
[10:34.900 --> 10:38.140]  Of course it does suck if you've had too many beers
[10:38.140 --> 10:39.340]  and you get stopped for a cop going,
[10:39.380 --> 10:41.260]  hey, you've had too many beers, let's talk to you.
[10:41.260 --> 10:43.420]  And you're okay, but you have mushrooms in your pocket.
[10:43.420 --> 10:45.060]  That can fuck things up.
[10:45.060 --> 10:47.060]  But if you were acting like an adult
[10:47.060 --> 10:48.700]  with almost anything in your pocket
[10:48.700 --> 10:50.340]  and you're not doing anything stupid,
[10:50.340 --> 10:53.180]  almost everything is legal and or decriminalized
[10:53.180 --> 10:57.140]  if you are a responsible adult with almost everything.
[10:57.140 --> 10:59.540]  Well, that's sort of how we do it in the US.
[10:59.540 --> 11:01.940]  Like you're allowed to have anything that's legal
[11:01.940 --> 11:03.980]  or whatever until you do something stupid with it,
[11:03.980 --> 11:06.260]  like cars, guns, kids.
[11:06.260 --> 11:07.100]  Right.
[11:07.820 --> 11:09.580]  As long as nobody knows that you've eaten
[11:09.580 --> 11:11.620]  three or four grams or maybe just 0.2
[11:11.620 --> 11:13.380]  as our buddy Tenasi recommends.
[11:13.380 --> 11:14.220]  Right.
[11:14.220 --> 11:16.380]  If nobody knows you've eaten a few grams of mushrooms
[11:16.380 --> 11:18.420]  and you were out, you should be just fine.
[11:18.420 --> 11:20.500]  But don't go out gooning out, acting like a weirdo
[11:20.500 --> 11:22.140]  because that is still not legal.
[11:22.140 --> 11:25.140]  It is not legal to go out fucking bugging out,
[11:25.140 --> 11:27.060]  staring off into space, watching the spiders
[11:27.060 --> 11:28.260]  crawl up your buddy's arm.
[11:28.260 --> 11:30.260]  That is embarrassing and it's still illegal.
[11:30.260 --> 11:31.900]  If that's what you want to do, man, go for it.
[11:31.900 --> 11:34.180]  But one of the things in the reporting around this
[11:34.180 --> 11:36.500]  that made me laugh is just how few cases
[11:37.340 --> 11:40.140]  involve mushrooms in Colorado anyway.
[11:41.740 --> 11:45.700]  One report I saw said three people in Denver County
[11:45.700 --> 11:48.860]  last year were charged with a mushroom-based offense
[11:48.860 --> 11:50.980]  and they were all charged with distribution,
[11:50.980 --> 11:53.580]  which this law wouldn't impact.
[11:53.580 --> 11:55.060]  Distribution's still a crime.
[11:55.060 --> 11:56.660]  Right, if you've got that much.
[11:57.660 --> 12:02.660]  And then the report I just read before we hit record said,
[12:02.900 --> 12:04.820]  and it was a two or three year span,
[12:04.820 --> 12:07.300]  there'd only been 11 cases involving mushrooms.
[12:07.300 --> 12:08.140]  Oh wow.
[12:08.140 --> 12:12.500]  And we have a major summer concert tour series through here.
[12:12.500 --> 12:13.980]  If mushrooms were an issue,
[12:13.980 --> 12:16.180]  we would have noticed in the numbers before now.
[12:16.180 --> 12:18.100]  We have a few festivals that come here.
[12:18.100 --> 12:20.020]  We have quite a few very large concerts.
[12:20.020 --> 12:21.500]  You're accurate with that.
[12:21.500 --> 12:22.940]  Is there an age limit to the mushrooms?
[12:22.940 --> 12:24.780]  Is it 18 or 21?
[12:24.780 --> 12:26.940]  It's just decriminalized for possession.
[12:26.940 --> 12:28.860]  I'm pretty sure it's at 18.
[12:28.860 --> 12:30.380]  Oh, that's pretty cool.
[12:30.380 --> 12:32.020]  But I'm not positive there.
[12:32.020 --> 12:33.580]  All right.
[12:33.580 --> 12:36.380]  So I'm excited and curious to see where this goes.
[12:36.380 --> 12:38.620]  I want to see the cultivation limits
[12:38.620 --> 12:40.820]  because when legalized cannabis became a thing,
[12:40.820 --> 12:42.740]  I was really curious about the cultivation limits
[12:42.740 --> 12:45.100]  and the possession limits and kind of how it plays out.
[12:45.100 --> 12:46.620]  I want to see how this goes.
[12:46.620 --> 12:50.740]  I'm really curious with all of the trending of microdosing,
[12:50.740 --> 12:53.580]  that's really going to have a large factor,
[12:53.580 --> 12:57.180]  a large role in how we allow and manage
[12:57.180 --> 12:59.300]  the production and possession, I think.
[12:59.300 --> 13:02.020]  Since everybody's microdosing, it's become so popular.
[13:02.020 --> 13:03.540]  I think people need to have it available
[13:03.540 --> 13:05.460]  if that's a medicine that's working for them.
[13:05.460 --> 13:07.500]  There definitely needs to be a legit
[13:07.500 --> 13:09.460]  like regulated supply chain for sure.
[13:09.460 --> 13:11.340]  Yeah. Or you have to...
[13:11.340 --> 13:13.660]  Well, there's a ton of research coming out
[13:14.620 --> 13:19.620]  all over the Southwest and the West Coast on psychedelics
[13:19.940 --> 13:22.420]  being used to treat a plethora of different things.
[13:22.420 --> 13:27.140]  Everything from like sleep problems to depression,
[13:27.140 --> 13:32.140]  to grief and loss, or is part of the process
[13:32.340 --> 13:35.380]  when you've been diagnosed with a terminal illness
[13:35.380 --> 13:37.500]  and sort of coming to grips with that diagnosis
[13:37.500 --> 13:40.020]  being part of your life now and the way forward.
[13:40.020 --> 13:42.740]  There's been research going on in this sector
[13:42.740 --> 13:45.860]  since the 60s, but it's all been super fringe.
[13:45.860 --> 13:50.860]  And now is sort of the golden age in opening up research
[13:50.860 --> 13:53.380]  that we've been blocking for the last 50 years.
[13:53.380 --> 13:54.220]  Right.
[13:54.220 --> 13:56.260]  And psychedelics and mushrooms
[13:56.260 --> 13:57.700]  is the next frontier in that.
[13:58.620 --> 14:01.060]  You're not a psychedelic user.
[14:01.060 --> 14:03.340]  You're a cannabis consumer and a cannabis advocate,
[14:03.340 --> 14:04.700]  but I think that's as far as it goes
[14:04.700 --> 14:06.180]  with mind expansion for you.
[14:07.260 --> 14:08.700]  How do you...
[14:08.700 --> 14:11.020]  Do you have an opinion on the legalization of...
[14:11.020 --> 14:12.460]  First off, we'll talk about mushrooms
[14:12.460 --> 14:14.020]  and then I'll ask about other drugs.
[14:14.020 --> 14:16.380]  This is a step in the right direction
[14:16.380 --> 14:17.940]  if you ask me policy-wise.
[14:17.940 --> 14:19.940]  And it's the conversations
[14:19.940 --> 14:22.260]  that Denver City Council is going to have now.
[14:22.300 --> 14:24.780]  We should have had for all drugs a long time ago.
[14:26.020 --> 14:27.100]  Prohibition doesn't work.
[14:27.100 --> 14:29.060]  It doesn't matter what you're trying to prohibit.
[14:29.060 --> 14:32.100]  It's why nuclear waste is regulated, not prohibited.
[14:34.940 --> 14:36.500]  These things exist in the world.
[14:36.500 --> 14:38.540]  We have to deal with them.
[14:38.540 --> 14:40.460]  We can't wish them away.
[14:40.460 --> 14:43.740]  And you can't legislate morality.
[14:44.700 --> 14:46.140]  None of these things work.
[14:47.220 --> 14:51.540]  If you go back even to the original creation
[14:51.540 --> 14:53.660]  of the idea of the police,
[14:55.860 --> 14:59.460]  they're not designed at all to protect you from yourself.
[14:59.460 --> 15:01.500]  That's not a function they can serve.
[15:01.500 --> 15:03.700]  They can protect you from me,
[15:03.700 --> 15:05.540]  but they can't protect you from you.
[15:07.020 --> 15:07.860]  It's impossible.
[15:07.860 --> 15:10.140]  It's like asking a fat dude to fly
[15:10.140 --> 15:12.300]  by flapping his arms really fast.
[15:12.300 --> 15:14.060]  It's not something that's physically possible.
[15:14.060 --> 15:16.780]  Asking him to do it is you being an asshole.
[15:16.780 --> 15:18.180]  And that's what prohibition is.
[15:18.180 --> 15:19.380]  It simply doesn't work
[15:19.420 --> 15:22.780]  and it creates all sorts of horrible things
[15:22.780 --> 15:25.580]  on its own right just by prohibition existing.
[15:25.580 --> 15:27.660]  We have to deal with all kinds of horrid shit
[15:27.660 --> 15:28.860]  we wouldn't have to deal with
[15:28.860 --> 15:32.060]  if we just went another way with all of this.
[15:32.060 --> 15:36.780]  And anytime you look at a list of drugs ranked by harm,
[15:36.780 --> 15:39.140]  mushrooms is at the very bottom of the list,
[15:39.140 --> 15:40.900]  which always surprised me
[15:40.900 --> 15:43.860]  because they emphasized in the drug education
[15:43.860 --> 15:46.820]  I received in our public education system
[15:46.820 --> 15:50.780]  that marijuana was sort of the entry level soft drug
[15:50.780 --> 15:53.660]  and mushrooms were a big scary step up from that
[15:53.660 --> 15:55.460]  where you could lose your mind.
[15:55.460 --> 15:59.220]  And the big rumor when I was in school
[15:59.220 --> 16:01.180]  was everybody had a cousin
[16:01.180 --> 16:03.500]  who thought he was a glass of orange juice.
[16:03.500 --> 16:05.060]  And every time you heard this story,
[16:05.060 --> 16:06.260]  you would fucking cringe,
[16:06.260 --> 16:08.460]  but you heard it every three months
[16:08.460 --> 16:09.660]  from the time you were eight
[16:09.660 --> 16:12.620]  till the time you were out of college.
[16:12.620 --> 16:13.900]  It was just fucking nonsense.
[16:13.900 --> 16:15.220]  I was afraid to get tipped over, man.
[16:15.220 --> 16:16.140]  I heard that story.
[16:16.460 --> 16:17.500]  I already ate too much acid though,
[16:17.500 --> 16:18.660]  was the story I heard.
[16:20.620 --> 16:22.300]  It was basically any psychedelic
[16:22.300 --> 16:23.580]  and it was always a different one.
[16:23.580 --> 16:25.100]  Sometimes it was fucking acid.
[16:25.100 --> 16:26.300]  Sometimes it was LSD.
[16:26.300 --> 16:27.540]  Sometimes it was mushrooms.
[16:27.540 --> 16:28.780]  Sometimes it was peyote.
[16:29.940 --> 16:31.380]  It was never really my thing,
[16:31.380 --> 16:32.780]  so I just sort of ignored it.
[16:32.780 --> 16:34.780]  And I've got a couple of funny stories
[16:34.780 --> 16:37.060]  about having to babysit a number of other people
[16:37.060 --> 16:39.820]  on mushrooms when I was in college,
[16:39.820 --> 16:42.980]  but I always volunteered to participate
[16:42.980 --> 16:45.140]  as the babysitter in those excursions
[16:46.060 --> 16:48.100]  because mushrooms weren't my thing.
[16:48.100 --> 16:49.820]  I was happy to go sober that night
[16:49.820 --> 16:52.140]  and make sure all my other friends had a fun time.
[16:52.140 --> 16:54.900]  Yeah, I've needed guys like you around occasionally.
[16:54.900 --> 16:55.740]  Yep.
[16:55.740 --> 16:57.100]  I, on the other hand,
[16:57.100 --> 16:59.820]  have had some mushroom experiences.
[16:59.820 --> 17:02.700]  And I've had lots of friends all the way through
[17:02.700 --> 17:05.300]  that enjoyed mushrooms.
[17:05.300 --> 17:06.580]  It's just never my thing.
[17:06.580 --> 17:10.060]  And I had a couple of people reach out to me online recently
[17:10.060 --> 17:11.780]  as this vote came up, just saying like,
[17:11.780 --> 17:13.260]  hey, I know you from the podcast.
[17:13.260 --> 17:14.980]  What do you think about this?
[17:15.820 --> 17:16.980]  And when I said like, mushrooms aren't my thing,
[17:16.980 --> 17:19.740]  like I've never really had an interest.
[17:19.740 --> 17:22.580]  I've always kind of met with shock that that's true
[17:22.580 --> 17:23.700]  and I'm a supporter.
[17:23.700 --> 17:25.060]  And it's like, it doesn't have anything to do
[17:25.060 --> 17:26.300]  with the mushrooms or the fact
[17:26.300 --> 17:28.620]  that they're super safe for people.
[17:28.620 --> 17:31.260]  Like if you look at the harm caused by drug consumption,
[17:31.260 --> 17:32.860]  mushrooms don't make the list of things
[17:32.860 --> 17:33.700]  you need to worry about.
[17:33.700 --> 17:36.620]  You need to worry more about what you had for lunch today
[17:36.620 --> 17:38.380]  or the soda you're drinking.
[17:38.380 --> 17:41.420]  They don't give you, from somebody who is,
[17:41.420 --> 17:42.700]  I mean, I used to be on Fish Tour
[17:42.700 --> 17:44.100]  and I've seen a bunch of Grateful Dead shows.
[17:44.100 --> 17:45.020]  You could tell by looking at me
[17:45.020 --> 17:48.100]  that I've got some psychedelic experiences under my belt.
[17:48.100 --> 17:50.180]  You can't, and from my opinion,
[17:50.180 --> 17:53.420]  you can't do mushrooms too many days in a row.
[17:53.420 --> 17:56.220]  You can't develop an addiction to that type of a thing
[17:56.220 --> 17:57.060]  because-
[17:57.060 --> 17:59.180]  You don't get physically addicted to psychedelics.
[17:59.180 --> 18:02.260]  It's just too much of, it's a brain workout.
[18:02.260 --> 18:04.020]  When you're done tripping on enough mushrooms,
[18:04.020 --> 18:05.620]  if you take a good dose, I don't know,
[18:05.620 --> 18:07.140]  we're going to talk in a minute about the difference
[18:07.140 --> 18:09.140]  between a micro dose and tripping.
[18:09.140 --> 18:11.500]  If you take, some people it's three grams,
[18:11.500 --> 18:12.820]  some people it's four.
[18:12.860 --> 18:14.860]  Guys like Tenasi and some other folks,
[18:14.860 --> 18:16.500]  Tenasi is a friend of mine that we'll meet later on
[18:16.500 --> 18:19.020]  in the podcast, a lot of people know who he is.
[18:19.020 --> 18:21.620]  But if you're taking a big heroic dose of mushrooms,
[18:21.620 --> 18:23.980]  which makes you break through is what we call it,
[18:23.980 --> 18:27.980]  your body and brain can't handle that multiple days in a row.
[18:27.980 --> 18:28.820]  You don't even want to do it.
[18:28.820 --> 18:29.980]  There's no desire.
[18:29.980 --> 18:32.900]  It's like having masturbated so many times,
[18:32.900 --> 18:34.300]  like, nope, I don't even want to do that again.
[18:34.300 --> 18:35.140]  I'm good.
[18:35.140 --> 18:36.100]  That last one was enough.
[18:36.100 --> 18:38.020]  I'm good for so many, so long.
[18:38.020 --> 18:38.860]  I'm cool.
[18:38.860 --> 18:40.060]  That's how a good mushroom trip is.
[18:40.060 --> 18:41.140]  You're like, hey, you want some more today?
[18:41.140 --> 18:42.540]  And you're like, no, dude.
[18:43.220 --> 18:44.460]  I exercised my brain so hard yesterday.
[18:44.460 --> 18:46.340]  It just needs a little rest today.
[18:46.340 --> 18:48.260]  And so I don't think you can really develop
[18:48.260 --> 18:49.580]  that type of an addiction.
[18:49.580 --> 18:52.140]  It's gotta be possible for somebody out there,
[18:52.140 --> 18:54.020]  but it's not the type of thing that most people
[18:54.020 --> 18:55.060]  are going to get stuck on.
[18:55.060 --> 18:56.940]  When you study drugs and drug use,
[18:56.940 --> 18:59.220]  that's one of the things that comes up during psychedelics
[18:59.220 --> 19:02.580]  is they're not addictive in the way that people think of it
[19:02.580 --> 19:04.140]  as drugs as being addictive.
[19:05.580 --> 19:08.220]  I'm not any sort of a scientist or doctor in that realm,
[19:08.220 --> 19:10.340]  but I think it's just because it works on your brain
[19:10.340 --> 19:12.420]  and not the other types of systems,
[19:13.300 --> 19:14.140]  which probably doesn't.
[19:14.140 --> 19:14.980]  It's an experience, not a feeling.
[19:14.980 --> 19:17.500]  Okay, that, I'm going to print that out.
[19:17.500 --> 19:19.140]  I want to print that out on paper.
[19:19.140 --> 19:21.820]  Bradley, if you're listening, write a song about that.
[19:22.740 --> 19:26.620]  It's just, the part that I really like about this
[19:26.620 --> 19:28.820]  is it's the first step in a conversation.
[19:29.780 --> 19:31.780]  We're just talking about Denver County.
[19:31.780 --> 19:33.780]  It's not even a whole state.
[19:33.780 --> 19:35.780]  And honestly, there are a lot of people here
[19:35.780 --> 19:38.140]  freaking the fuck out over what this means
[19:38.140 --> 19:41.660]  and what it says about a society.
[19:41.700 --> 19:43.780]  It says that we're progressive and we're forward thinking
[19:43.780 --> 19:45.580]  and we believe that people are adult enough
[19:45.580 --> 19:47.180]  to actually manage their own lives
[19:47.180 --> 19:49.260]  and that we don't need government involvement.
[19:49.260 --> 19:53.300]  There's, I mean, for my whole adult life,
[19:53.300 --> 19:56.220]  we've needed to have a real adult conversation
[19:56.220 --> 20:01.220]  about mistakes we've been making for the last 100 years
[20:02.540 --> 20:04.460]  and how to move forward,
[20:04.460 --> 20:06.780]  understanding that they're mistakes.
[20:06.780 --> 20:10.100]  And drug prohibition is at the top of this list for me.
[20:10.100 --> 20:14.020]  It literally poisons every other aspect of society
[20:14.020 --> 20:16.820]  and it does us absolutely zero good.
[20:17.940 --> 20:20.180]  And it doesn't matter what drug you're talking about,
[20:20.180 --> 20:26.480]  but steps like this where first we force them
[20:26.480 --> 20:27.680]  to legalize marijuana,
[20:27.680 --> 20:30.920]  and this started back with Denver decriminalizing marijuana
[20:30.920 --> 20:32.720]  like back in the 70s.
[20:32.720 --> 20:35.240]  And it's been a slow inch to,
[20:35.240 --> 20:39.040]  we've got marijuana legalized in several states now.
[20:39.040 --> 20:41.800]  Now it's time to start really having this conversation
[20:41.800 --> 20:43.480]  about other drugs.
[20:43.480 --> 20:47.320]  And having had the marijuana conversation already,
[20:47.320 --> 20:49.080]  especially in places like Colorado
[20:49.080 --> 20:53.040]  where it's been a continuous conversation for 20 years now,
[20:53.040 --> 20:56.000]  the arguments for marijuana legalization,
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.400]  a lot of them don't have anything to do with marijuana
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.160]  and they have to do with a massively popular product,
[21:03.160 --> 21:06.680]  a black market and our attempts to prohibit all of this.
[21:06.680 --> 21:10.400]  And they're easily applied to every other drug
[21:10.400 --> 21:11.840]  that we prohibit.
[21:11.840 --> 21:13.840]  And if you want to get into it,
[21:13.840 --> 21:17.240]  we can go straight to heroin and fentanyl and argue that,
[21:17.240 --> 21:19.280]  which is where most people tend to take it.
[21:19.280 --> 21:21.000]  But I mean, it doesn't really matter
[21:21.000 --> 21:22.440]  what you're talking about in my opinion.
[21:22.440 --> 21:25.000]  Prohibition makes the situation worse.
[21:25.000 --> 21:28.040]  And legalization is where we need to head with all of this.
[21:29.000 --> 21:29.920]  So if it were up to,
[21:29.920 --> 21:32.320]  if White Mike was president or drug czar
[21:32.320 --> 21:34.400]  or leader of the DEA,
[21:34.400 --> 21:38.000]  would you basically find a way to allow every drug
[21:38.000 --> 21:41.200]  to be legal and then, yeah, okay.
[21:41.200 --> 21:42.480]  And I would agree with that.
[21:42.480 --> 21:44.280]  Not just, and you are not,
[21:44.280 --> 21:47.640]  you're not a drug type of person.
[21:47.640 --> 21:48.760]  I know that's weird to classify,
[21:48.760 --> 21:50.600]  but there are people out there that fucking love drugs.
[21:50.600 --> 21:51.920]  People out there just want to get fucked up.
[21:51.920 --> 21:52.920]  There are people that will admit it.
[21:52.920 --> 21:54.160]  I'll do whatever you got.
[21:54.160 --> 21:55.160]  You're not that kind of guy,
[21:55.160 --> 21:57.560]  but you feel that we should have the opportunity to,
[21:57.560 --> 21:59.840]  if I wanted to go out there and put crack in my butt,
[21:59.840 --> 22:01.720]  you think I should be able to do that?
[22:01.720 --> 22:06.040]  Yeah, I think us trying to prohibit you from getting crack
[22:06.040 --> 22:10.160]  is much more harmful than you having the availability
[22:10.160 --> 22:11.760]  to buy crack in a store.
[22:11.760 --> 22:13.560]  I like that, yeah.
[22:13.560 --> 22:15.920]  There's literally nothing that people want to buy
[22:15.920 --> 22:17.400]  that they can't buy.
[22:17.400 --> 22:18.920]  It's all for sale.
[22:18.920 --> 22:22.280]  And our attempts to prohibit it make it more dangerous.
[22:22.280 --> 22:23.600]  They make it impure.
[22:23.600 --> 22:27.000]  They make it underground.
[22:27.000 --> 22:30.400]  And like liquor store A never goes to war
[22:30.400 --> 22:32.400]  with liquor store B in the street
[22:32.400 --> 22:35.240]  over customer bases or turf,
[22:35.240 --> 22:38.360]  but rival crack dealers getting shootouts
[22:38.360 --> 22:40.880]  all the fucking time over customers and turf.
[22:40.880 --> 22:42.440]  Yep.
[22:42.440 --> 22:46.200]  There are things inherent with having the illegal market
[22:46.200 --> 22:48.520]  produce things that humans consume
[22:48.520 --> 22:50.160]  to the tunes of billions of dollars.
[22:50.160 --> 22:52.160]  The liquor store never finds you and shoots you
[22:52.160 --> 22:54.680]  because you got a big old vodka debt.
[22:54.680 --> 22:55.680]  Yep.
[22:55.680 --> 22:58.640]  When you go to a liquor store to buy liquor,
[22:58.640 --> 23:03.600]  you walk into a regulated business that's reasonably safe
[23:03.600 --> 23:06.600]  and you buy a product that's specific
[23:06.600 --> 23:08.840]  and regulated and standardized.
[23:08.840 --> 23:11.000]  And so when you buy a beer,
[23:11.000 --> 23:12.560]  it's stamped right on the side,
[23:12.560 --> 23:17.280]  three, two or six, zero or whatever is legal in your area.
[23:17.280 --> 23:20.280]  And you understand how that's going to affect you.
[23:20.280 --> 23:22.840]  When you buy a bag of heroin on the street,
[23:22.840 --> 23:25.920]  you don't know if you're getting 25% pure,
[23:25.960 --> 23:30.720]  30% pure, 60% pure or 2% pure laced with fentanyl
[23:30.720 --> 23:32.720]  and a fuckload of baby powder.
[23:32.720 --> 23:34.920]  You have no idea what the fuck you're getting.
[23:38.280 --> 23:41.600]  There's major implications to that to the end consumer.
[23:43.120 --> 23:46.880]  Further, like you could offer me all the free heroin.
[23:46.880 --> 23:49.040]  Like you could put down a kilo of heroin and be like,
[23:49.040 --> 23:50.720]  here, take this home if you want.
[23:50.720 --> 23:52.080]  And I'd be like, no thanks.
[23:52.080 --> 23:53.440]  Yeah, me too.
[23:53.440 --> 23:56.200]  I'm not interested in any heroin,
[23:57.320 --> 24:01.160]  but like, I appreciate the offer, but no thank you.
[24:01.160 --> 24:06.160]  And it's because I understand what that drug is capable of
[24:06.160 --> 24:08.280]  and a lot of other stuff and I'm just not interested.
[24:08.280 --> 24:10.760]  And so you solve these things with education
[24:10.760 --> 24:15.760]  and access to health care, not with the threat of jail.
[24:15.920 --> 24:17.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[24:17.200 --> 24:18.560]  If you become, if you do,
[24:18.560 --> 24:20.360]  and I'm not even going to go down the addiction
[24:20.360 --> 24:21.520]  as a disease path,
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.800]  but if you do become addicted to something
[24:23.800 --> 24:24.840]  and you'd like some help,
[24:24.840 --> 24:27.520]  it is hard to reach out because now you're a criminal.
[24:27.520 --> 24:29.280]  You've been doing this, what?
[24:29.280 --> 24:30.560]  That's a criminal thing.
[24:30.560 --> 24:32.960]  It needs to be treated more as a health problem.
[24:32.960 --> 24:34.640]  You've got a health issue.
[24:34.640 --> 24:37.160]  I am addicted to fucking Dr. Pepper.
[24:37.160 --> 24:38.800]  Nobody is going to arrest me.
[24:38.800 --> 24:39.720]  They should.
[24:39.720 --> 24:41.560]  For how many Dr. Peppers I have consumed today,
[24:41.560 --> 24:42.880]  somebody should beat my ass,
[24:42.880 --> 24:44.640]  but nobody cares because it's Dr. Pepper.
[24:44.640 --> 24:45.720]  I'm going to get diabetes.
[24:45.720 --> 24:46.960]  It's going to be miserable,
[24:46.960 --> 24:48.720]  but since it's Dr. Pepper, that's my addiction.
[24:48.720 --> 24:49.720]  It's okay.
[24:49.720 --> 24:50.680]  That's my thing.
[24:50.680 --> 24:52.000]  I'm the one poisoning me.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.760]  I'm not hurting anybody except when I die,
[24:53.760 --> 24:54.600]  people are going to miss me,
[24:54.600 --> 24:56.440]  but we all got to die anyway.
[24:56.440 --> 24:57.280]  I don't like-
[24:57.280 --> 24:59.080]  Because you're talking about caffeine,
[24:59.080 --> 25:01.360]  but because it's legal, it's regulated.
[25:01.360 --> 25:04.160]  Like they tried to pull 4Loko off the shelf
[25:04.160 --> 25:05.840]  because they don't like when people mix
[25:05.840 --> 25:08.000]  a whole bunch of alcohol with a whole bunch of caffeine.
[25:08.000 --> 25:09.520]  I'm not good at that.
[25:09.520 --> 25:13.240]  Most places, like you'll see them on road trips
[25:13.240 --> 25:15.000]  and truck stops by the register.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.800]  They've got like super duper caffeine pills.
[25:17.800 --> 25:20.040]  There's been attempts to get those off the fucking market
[25:20.040 --> 25:22.600]  because every now and then some trucker ODs on them
[25:22.600 --> 25:24.000]  or some teenager ODs on them,
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.720]  and they end up in the hospital in a serious medical event
[25:26.720 --> 25:29.680]  because they've consumed hundreds of times
[25:29.680 --> 25:31.800]  the safe dose of caffeine.
[25:31.800 --> 25:32.640]  That's not even fun.
[25:32.640 --> 25:33.840]  That doesn't feel good.
[25:33.840 --> 25:36.840]  Do you think that most drugs would work themselves out?
[25:36.840 --> 25:39.680]  Now, in most situations, in my experience,
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.080]  the way that I have learned to tolerate
[25:42.080 --> 25:44.480]  and handle almost anything I've been given,
[25:44.480 --> 25:46.800]  whether it's chocolate milk,
[25:46.800 --> 25:48.680]  I've made myself feel like shit with chocolate milk.
[25:48.680 --> 25:49.720]  You know how I learned?
[25:50.400 --> 25:51.240]  I tried a little bit of it,
[25:51.240 --> 25:52.080]  and then I had a glass of it,
[25:52.080 --> 25:53.000]  and I was like, chocolate milk's fucking good.
[25:53.000 --> 25:54.280]  I want two glasses of it.
[25:54.280 --> 25:55.640]  I'm almost fucking vegan now.
[25:55.640 --> 25:57.600]  I haven't had chocolate milk in probably 20 years.
[25:57.600 --> 25:58.680]  I've just picked something that I know
[25:58.680 --> 26:00.400]  would give me a stomach ache.
[26:00.400 --> 26:02.000]  So I discovered chocolate milk, right?
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.200]  I'm like, this is fucking good shit.
[26:03.200 --> 26:04.360]  Had a glass of it.
[26:04.360 --> 26:05.200]  It was good.
[26:05.200 --> 26:06.160]  Had two glasses of it.
[26:06.160 --> 26:07.920]  Stomach felt fucking, ooh.
[26:07.920 --> 26:09.440]  Third glass, oh, I want to die.
[26:09.440 --> 26:10.280]  Stomach hurts.
[26:10.280 --> 26:11.400]  I hate this shit.
[26:11.400 --> 26:13.480]  That's how I learned about alcohol.
[26:13.480 --> 26:15.040]  That's how I learned about chocolate milk.
[26:15.040 --> 26:17.440]  That's how I learned about how much cereal I can eat.
[26:17.480 --> 26:19.800]  That's how I've learned how much kombucha I can drink.
[26:19.800 --> 26:21.520]  That's how you learn how much pasta you can eat
[26:21.520 --> 26:23.040]  before you want to die.
[26:23.040 --> 26:25.360]  I think just exposing yourself to it
[26:25.360 --> 26:28.240]  and not treating it like it's some crazy fucking thing
[26:28.240 --> 26:30.160]  and giving you the opportunity to learn
[26:30.160 --> 26:32.120]  and the choice if you want it or not,
[26:32.120 --> 26:35.480]  it gives you the ability to make a decision.
[26:35.480 --> 26:38.400]  Do I, how am I, and to learn and experience.
[26:38.400 --> 26:40.000]  Like, where is my limit to this?
[26:40.000 --> 26:41.280]  Do you think most of the other drugs
[26:41.280 --> 26:43.280]  will kind of work themselves out by,
[26:43.280 --> 26:45.280]  I'll see my buddy over there who tried the heroin
[26:45.280 --> 26:47.040]  just puking, and I'll go, I don't want to do that.
[26:47.640 --> 26:50.040]  But then I'll see the guy that ate a little mushrooms,
[26:50.040 --> 26:51.200]  I already know my limit on mushrooms,
[26:51.200 --> 26:52.280]  and I'll say, well, that looks like fun.
[26:52.280 --> 26:53.240]  He ate, how much did he eat?
[26:53.240 --> 26:54.120]  Oh, he ate one gram.
[26:54.120 --> 26:54.960]  I want to do that.
[26:54.960 --> 26:55.800]  How much did he eat?
[26:55.800 --> 26:56.920]  He ate seven grams and he's laying on the floor
[26:56.920 --> 26:57.760]  digging into the dirt.
[26:57.760 --> 26:58.600]  I don't want to be there.
[26:58.600 --> 26:59.480]  I'm going to try one gram,
[26:59.480 --> 27:01.040]  and then I'm going to try two and see.
[27:01.040 --> 27:02.440]  Do you think people have,
[27:02.440 --> 27:04.520]  do you think we're going to figure ourselves out like that?
[27:04.520 --> 27:06.200]  Or do you think a bunch of us are just going to goon out
[27:06.200 --> 27:08.640]  and end up in the streets, fucking full retard?
[27:08.640 --> 27:10.480]  Well, I think anybody who's going to goon out
[27:10.480 --> 27:13.640]  and end up in the streets is going to do that regardless.
[27:13.640 --> 27:15.360]  With or without decriminalization, right?
[27:15.440 --> 27:16.280]  With or without decriminalization.
[27:16.280 --> 27:17.400]  They're going to get it, they're going to goon out.
[27:17.400 --> 27:20.000]  Or if I was king of the world and everything was legalized.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.120]  But that's the thing that's cool about this law
[27:24.120 --> 27:26.760]  is it pushes the conversation forward another step.
[27:27.880 --> 27:31.280]  Until marijuana was legal, like legal, legal,
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.280]  we didn't have any sort of concept
[27:35.280 --> 27:40.200]  of what an individual dose of a marijuana edible would be.
[27:40.200 --> 27:43.840]  And since then we've come up with sort of guesstimates
[27:43.840 --> 27:46.720]  and we're working the kinks out of those right now
[27:46.720 --> 27:49.440]  as states legalize.
[27:49.440 --> 27:52.240]  Everybody's kind of doing it their own little,
[27:52.240 --> 27:55.960]  every state's got to do it their special way.
[27:55.960 --> 27:58.920]  And so over the next 20 years,
[27:58.920 --> 28:01.440]  we're going to watch all that play out and figure out,
[28:01.440 --> 28:05.840]  okay, maybe 10 was a little low, let's call it 15 now.
[28:05.840 --> 28:07.040]  Or maybe 10 was a little high,
[28:07.040 --> 28:08.920]  let's call it seven and a half now.
[28:08.920 --> 28:10.120]  You know what I mean?
[28:10.120 --> 28:12.600]  And now Denver's about to start that conversation
[28:12.640 --> 28:13.960]  with mushrooms.
[28:13.960 --> 28:17.000]  And over the next six months or a year,
[28:17.000 --> 28:20.840]  the conversation in a very public and real way about,
[28:20.840 --> 28:23.040]  well, how much is a reasonable amount of mushrooms
[28:23.040 --> 28:24.760]  for someone to grow at home?
[28:24.760 --> 28:28.040]  If you're micro dosing to treat your depression,
[28:28.040 --> 28:31.720]  what sort of growth setup is realistic for an amateur
[28:31.720 --> 28:33.880]  to produce enough product for them
[28:33.880 --> 28:37.080]  to sustain their dose regimen?
[28:38.480 --> 28:40.440]  If it's just a sometime concert goer,
[28:40.440 --> 28:44.480]  what's a new dose for mushrooms
[28:44.480 --> 28:45.880]  where they're going to have
[28:45.880 --> 28:48.720]  a pleasant intoxicating experience
[28:48.720 --> 28:51.320]  rather than a, I got sick and threw up
[28:51.320 --> 28:53.000]  on everybody experience.
[28:53.880 --> 28:56.440]  Or I ended up in the hospital while they laughed at me
[28:56.440 --> 28:59.400]  and gave me water kind of experience.
[29:01.480 --> 29:04.720]  And that conversation hasn't taken place in the US before.
[29:04.720 --> 29:06.680]  I have a feeling it took place in the Netherlands
[29:06.680 --> 29:08.600]  because I know for at least for a long time,
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.800]  you could buy mushrooms in a lot of the head shops
[29:10.800 --> 29:13.120]  and coffee shops there.
[29:13.120 --> 29:17.440]  But we definitely haven't had that conversation in the US.
[29:17.440 --> 29:20.360]  And as states move to decriminalize mushrooms
[29:20.360 --> 29:23.080]  and other drugs, all of these conversations
[29:23.080 --> 29:24.960]  are going to have to take place.
[29:24.960 --> 29:29.520]  And how we legalize or how we regulate other drugs,
[29:29.520 --> 29:32.880]  all those conversations are going to have to take place.
[29:32.880 --> 29:35.480]  One of the other bills that they talked about in Denver
[29:35.480 --> 29:38.080]  this session was safe injection facilities.
[29:38.680 --> 29:40.240]  And people freaked out.
[29:40.240 --> 29:42.560]  So like, people are going to travel across the country
[29:42.560 --> 29:45.200]  so they can do heroin in this train car
[29:45.200 --> 29:46.840]  that they set up in Denver,
[29:46.840 --> 29:48.560]  where there's just a doctor on site
[29:48.560 --> 29:51.400]  in case you do get something that's got more fentanyl in it
[29:51.400 --> 29:52.960]  than you were expecting.
[29:52.960 --> 29:54.600]  And you end up needing medical help.
[29:54.600 --> 29:55.840]  It's just right there.
[29:55.840 --> 29:57.560]  That's all it fucking is.
[29:57.560 --> 30:00.480]  And the idea that a hardcore heroin addict
[30:00.480 --> 30:02.320]  is going to have money to move across the country
[30:02.320 --> 30:04.000]  is just sort of bad shit.
[30:04.000 --> 30:06.680]  But we're finally having these conversations in the US
[30:06.680 --> 30:08.400]  and I wasn't sure we were ever going to have them.
[30:09.160 --> 30:10.280]  Honestly, when I was studying this shit in college,
[30:10.280 --> 30:11.400]  I was like, it's a fantasy
[30:11.400 --> 30:13.760]  that we're ever going to move this far forward.
[30:15.360 --> 30:17.040]  Mainly because we love to do shit
[30:17.040 --> 30:19.480]  just because that's how we do shit.
[30:19.480 --> 30:23.120]  Decriminalization, black market is still the source market.
[30:23.120 --> 30:25.160]  And so you're left with all of the problems
[30:25.160 --> 30:28.320]  of the production and distribution chain being illegal.
[30:29.680 --> 30:32.400]  You don't like, I hate that marijuana
[30:32.400 --> 30:33.920]  is grown on public land.
[30:33.920 --> 30:37.640]  I love marijuana, but I also love our national parks.
[30:37.640 --> 30:40.080]  And I hate that because it's illegal,
[30:40.080 --> 30:41.280]  it's grown in national parks.
[30:41.280 --> 30:42.920]  It's the same thing with all the other drugs.
[30:42.920 --> 30:46.120]  They're produced in ways that are super fucking destructive
[30:46.120 --> 30:47.640]  because they're illegal.
[30:47.640 --> 30:51.000]  If heroin were legal, we wouldn't have poppy fields
[30:51.000 --> 30:53.640]  all over different parts of the planet
[30:53.640 --> 30:55.640]  just fucking up the economy right now.
[30:55.640 --> 30:57.640]  Same thing with coca production.
[30:57.640 --> 31:00.080]  Like it wouldn't be little kids stomping on coca leaves
[31:00.080 --> 31:01.760]  in the fucking jungles of Peru
[31:01.760 --> 31:04.200]  so that people in New York could have their blow.
[31:04.400 --> 31:07.920]  Like, it just makes sense to have this shit legal.
[31:07.920 --> 31:11.720]  If you ask me, feel free to send hay mail to atnemopunk15.
[31:11.720 --> 31:13.040]  I don't think the listeners of this show
[31:13.040 --> 31:13.880]  are going to hate you.
[31:13.880 --> 31:15.600]  I think most of the people that listen to this show
[31:15.600 --> 31:17.480]  are open-minded and they're free thinkers
[31:17.480 --> 31:18.720]  and they would encourage other people
[31:18.720 --> 31:20.040]  to think for themselves.
[31:20.040 --> 31:23.320]  And most of us are informed and wise enough
[31:23.320 --> 31:25.760]  to not do things to our body and our minds
[31:25.760 --> 31:28.320]  that aren't going to benefit us in some way.
[31:28.320 --> 31:31.280]  And sometimes you gotta learn by seeing and doing,
[31:31.280 --> 31:33.920]  but I think most of us are smart enough
[31:34.640 --> 31:35.480]  to make our own decisions.
[31:35.480 --> 31:37.800]  I think there's two conversations
[31:37.800 --> 31:39.720]  that are really pushing this forward.
[31:39.720 --> 31:42.800]  One is, I mean, marijuana legalization
[31:42.800 --> 31:44.720]  is a conversation that's happening
[31:44.720 --> 31:47.120]  in every corner of the US right now.
[31:47.120 --> 31:50.440]  And in places like Colorado where it's already happened,
[31:50.440 --> 31:53.760]  we're discussing how it's playing out
[31:53.760 --> 31:56.520]  and tweaks we need to make to the law.
[31:56.520 --> 31:59.000]  And the other conversation that's taking place
[31:59.000 --> 32:03.480]  is law enforcement-based.
[32:03.480 --> 32:07.880]  And problems with how we police ourselves as a society
[32:07.880 --> 32:10.240]  and changes we need to make to that.
[32:10.240 --> 32:11.960]  And I think both of those conversations
[32:11.960 --> 32:13.080]  happening at the same time
[32:13.080 --> 32:17.880]  are really pushing things like this Denver law forward.
[32:17.880 --> 32:18.880]  Most people get it.
[32:18.880 --> 32:21.560]  They see the problems that prohibition causes
[32:21.560 --> 32:24.120]  and they see how pointless our efforts have been
[32:24.120 --> 32:25.680]  and how wasteful they've been.
[32:25.680 --> 32:27.360]  The other part of this is like,
[32:27.360 --> 32:29.600]  when heroin was legal before it was outlawed,
[32:29.600 --> 32:33.000]  the most popular consumption method was a low-dose liquid.
[32:34.880 --> 32:38.040]  People always go straight to heroin in this conversation.
[32:38.040 --> 32:40.120]  And it's back when it was legal, man,
[32:40.120 --> 32:42.360]  it was fucking housewives drinking laudanum.
[32:43.320 --> 32:45.480]  We didn't have a heroin junkie problem
[32:45.480 --> 32:47.360]  until long after it had been made illegal.
[32:47.360 --> 32:49.880]  And then we got everybody addicted to fucking morphine
[32:49.880 --> 32:51.120]  in the army hospitals.
[32:53.240 --> 32:54.080]  Look it up, man.
[32:54.080 --> 32:56.280]  Drug history is interesting as shit.
[32:56.280 --> 32:57.120]  Absolutely.
[32:57.120 --> 32:58.400]  Mike, thanks for coming and educating us.
[32:58.400 --> 33:00.680]  We've been going for about 30 something-ish minutes now
[33:00.680 --> 33:02.000]  after a couple of quick edits.
[33:02.000 --> 33:03.920]  So we should probably start wrapping up this show.
[33:03.920 --> 33:04.760]  It's getting kind of late.
[33:04.760 --> 33:06.080]  We should probably get you home back to the kids.
[33:06.080 --> 33:06.920]  It was a great show, man.
[33:06.920 --> 33:07.760]  I had a lot of fun.
[33:07.760 --> 33:09.000]  I hope you had as much fun as I did.
[33:09.000 --> 33:11.200]  I hope everybody listening had a bunch of fun.
[33:11.200 --> 33:12.160]  Let's recap.
[33:13.160 --> 33:14.480]  Maybe they're magic, maybe they're not.
[33:14.480 --> 33:15.600]  That's up to you to decide.
[33:15.600 --> 33:17.000]  Depends on how many you eat, I guess.
[33:17.000 --> 33:18.560]  It's not magic, it's science.
[33:18.560 --> 33:20.160]  It is science.
[33:20.160 --> 33:21.040]  It's spiritual.
[33:21.040 --> 33:22.360]  It's not a feeling.
[33:22.360 --> 33:23.960]  I don't even remember what you said.
[33:23.960 --> 33:25.800]  It's not a feeling, it's an experience.
[33:25.800 --> 33:26.640]  Maybe that's it.
[33:26.640 --> 33:27.520]  Maybe it's a little bit of both.
[33:27.560 --> 33:28.400]  It depends on how many you eat.
[33:28.400 --> 33:30.240]  Once again, they are not legal.
[33:30.240 --> 33:32.320]  They are decriminalized, which is a big difference.
[33:32.320 --> 33:34.760]  If you have too much, they will still arrest you.
[33:34.760 --> 33:35.680]  Right now, at this point,
[33:35.680 --> 33:37.920]  it is up to the cop to decide how much is too much.
[33:37.920 --> 33:38.960]  If you got a backpack full
[33:38.960 --> 33:41.160]  and you're trying to hook everybody up on the campus,
[33:41.160 --> 33:42.160]  you're going to jail, bro.
[33:42.160 --> 33:43.000]  If you got enough
[33:43.000 --> 33:44.720]  so where you can get a couple of trips on this weekend,
[33:44.720 --> 33:46.960]  you'll be just fine, probably.
[33:46.960 --> 33:48.960]  In Denver, the way they used to screw with you
[33:48.960 --> 33:51.800]  back when marijuana was decriminalized
[33:51.800 --> 33:55.320]  is how many bags you had and if you had a scale.
[33:55.320 --> 33:56.160]  Oh, yeah.
[33:56.280 --> 33:59.280]  If you went to your guy and tried to order a quarter
[33:59.280 --> 34:01.960]  and they gave it to you in seven gram bags,
[34:01.960 --> 34:04.200]  I was always like, you motherfucker.
[34:04.200 --> 34:05.600]  Because as soon as possible,
[34:05.600 --> 34:07.760]  I had to get that into one sandwich bag
[34:07.760 --> 34:10.480]  because if you get busted with seven one gram bags,
[34:10.480 --> 34:13.000]  you didn't buy a quarter, you're trying to sell seven dimes.
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.920]  That is intent to distribute if they choose to do so.
[34:15.920 --> 34:17.960]  So be careful, don't have too much.
[34:17.960 --> 34:19.160]  And that is in Denver.
[34:19.160 --> 34:20.680]  It is not all of Colorado.
[34:20.680 --> 34:22.240]  So like we said earlier,
[34:22.240 --> 34:25.440]  most of the concert venues, you are shit out of luck.
[34:25.480 --> 34:28.200]  Anywhere outside of Denver, Pueblo, Colorado Springs,
[34:28.200 --> 34:32.200]  Fort Collins, Boulder, all still illegal possession
[34:32.200 --> 34:33.320]  for mushrooms.
[34:35.280 --> 34:37.520]  You'll be all right, don't worry.
[34:37.520 --> 34:39.680]  All right, Mike, I think it is time to wrap up this podcast.
[34:39.680 --> 34:41.520]  You got any Mike's final thoughts,
[34:41.520 --> 34:42.720]  sort of a Jerry's final thoughts,
[34:42.720 --> 34:44.760]  sort of a thing going on here at the end of the show?
[34:44.760 --> 34:46.040]  I have a great day, everybody.
[34:46.040 --> 34:47.080]  Thanks for listening.
[34:47.080 --> 34:47.920]  That was nice and easy.
[34:47.920 --> 34:48.760]  Put this up on social media.
[34:48.760 --> 34:51.520]  There you go, that's a great segue, social media, you guys.
[34:51.520 --> 34:52.760]  Social media, I would appreciate it
[34:52.760 --> 34:55.320]  if you find me on Instagram.
[34:55.320 --> 34:57.240]  Check, no, let's go for Cannabis this time.
[34:57.240 --> 34:58.280]  Let's talk about Cannabis.
[34:58.280 --> 35:01.040]  Cannabis is a new cannabis-friendly,
[35:01.040 --> 35:03.160]  cannabis-based social media app.
[35:03.160 --> 35:06.160]  I post a lot of fine cannabis photography there.
[35:06.160 --> 35:07.400]  Come check me out on Cannabis.
[35:07.400 --> 35:09.200]  I think you would enjoy it.
[35:09.200 --> 35:10.400]  Hey Mike, would you like people
[35:10.400 --> 35:12.200]  to follow your Facebook page?
[35:12.200 --> 35:13.600]  You can check me out on Facebook.
[35:13.600 --> 35:15.800]  It's Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws,
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.880]  or you can find me at Twitter, at Nemo Punk 15.
[35:19.880 --> 35:21.800]  There we go, give him a follow.
[35:21.840 --> 35:23.960]  Check out his Facebook page.
[35:23.960 --> 35:26.240]  He posts some great cannabis-friendly rants.
[35:26.240 --> 35:27.720]  He gets some people trying to troll him on there,
[35:27.720 --> 35:29.880]  and I think he just slays the trolls.
[35:29.880 --> 35:30.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
[35:30.720 --> 35:33.520]  for listening to this long, rambly episode.
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.080]  I hope you had a great time.
[35:35.080 --> 35:36.920]  I hope you had as much fun as Mike and I did.
[35:36.920 --> 35:38.520]  I'll be back in just a couple of days
[35:38.520 --> 35:40.220]  with some fresh new content.
[35:40.220 --> 35:42.600]  Don't forget to check out our sponsor, Oregon Elite Seeds.
[35:42.600 --> 35:45.880]  You can find them at OregonEliteSeeds.com.
[35:45.880 --> 35:48.360]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend, James Butterson,
[35:48.360 --> 35:50.480]  and until next time, take a fat dab
[35:50.480 --> 35:52.080]  and give your mom a hug for me.
