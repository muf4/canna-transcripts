[00:14.650 --> 00:17.170]  Yeah, welcome back, Cannabis community.
[00:17.170 --> 00:19.210]  It's time for episode number 233
[00:19.210 --> 00:21.150]  of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.150 --> 00:24.810]  Your source for cannabis news, education, and conversation.
[00:24.810 --> 00:25.930]  That's right, if you're a new grower,
[00:25.930 --> 00:27.130]  if you're a professional grower,
[00:27.130 --> 00:29.610]  if you're a new smoker or a dedicated dabber,
[00:29.610 --> 00:31.090]  if you're a cannabis activist,
[00:31.090 --> 00:32.450]  or even someone who's just curious
[00:32.450 --> 00:34.270]  about the current state of cannabis,
[00:34.270 --> 00:37.090]  this, my friends, is the podcast for you.
[00:37.090 --> 00:39.010]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:39.010 --> 00:40.970]  I wanna thank you guys again for joining me.
[00:40.970 --> 00:43.050]  As always, I need to give a huge thank you shout out
[00:43.050 --> 00:44.650]  to my friends in the Mystic Roots band
[00:44.650 --> 00:47.210]  for letting me use their music on my podcast.
[00:47.210 --> 00:51.210]  Big thanks to Kat, Ku, and the entire Mystic Roots crew.
[00:52.090 --> 00:53.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, White Mike is back.
[00:53.730 --> 00:54.770]  Welcome to the show, bro.
[00:54.770 --> 00:55.610]  What's up, man?
[00:55.610 --> 00:57.290]  Doing good, man, how about yourself?
[00:57.290 --> 00:58.130]  Good week, having a good time?
[00:58.130 --> 00:59.130]  I said I'm doing good.
[00:59.130 --> 01:01.330]  That's not very good grammar for a podcast host.
[01:01.330 --> 01:03.410]  I am doing well, thank you.
[01:03.410 --> 01:04.250]  Good to hear.
[01:04.250 --> 01:05.070]  Should we give him an English lesson?
[01:05.070 --> 01:07.270]  Doing good would mean that I am out doing good things.
[01:07.270 --> 01:09.770]  I'm doing good, I'm passing out food to homeless people,
[01:09.770 --> 01:11.170]  and I'm helping old ladies across the street.
[01:11.170 --> 01:12.290]  I am doing good.
[01:12.290 --> 01:13.410]  The world needs more of that.
[01:13.410 --> 01:15.830]  But I feel well, so I am doing well.
[01:17.770 --> 01:19.770]  This shows off to a very odd start.
[01:19.770 --> 01:20.610]  I like it.
[01:20.610 --> 01:21.810]  Enough of the English lessons.
[01:21.810 --> 01:22.650]  Welcome to the show, man.
[01:22.650 --> 01:23.470]  Thanks for joining me today.
[01:23.470 --> 01:26.330]  This odd intro is brought to you by the Thermal Bucket.
[01:26.330 --> 01:27.410]  Oh, the Thermal Banger.
[01:27.410 --> 01:29.370]  We talked about that one on the last episode.
[01:29.370 --> 01:33.970]  Yes, I just did drop a gigantic dab of some Lemon Jeffery.
[01:33.970 --> 01:35.810]  I know, it's Lemon Skunk.
[01:35.810 --> 01:36.730]  We call it Lemon Pea.
[01:36.730 --> 01:39.450]  It's Lemon Skunk, Prodigium mixed, and some Shatter.
[01:39.450 --> 01:41.130]  And I just dunked a huge ass dab of that
[01:41.130 --> 01:43.530]  into some Lemon Jeffery, high terpene,
[01:43.530 --> 01:44.970]  full spectrum extracts.
[01:44.970 --> 01:46.730]  We took a dab of that.
[01:46.730 --> 01:48.410]  It is still a little cloudy.
[01:48.410 --> 01:50.370]  My head is cloudy, the room is cloudy.
[01:50.370 --> 01:52.470]  It all matches in here.
[01:52.470 --> 01:53.870]  Man, Mike and I have been working together
[01:53.870 --> 01:55.170]  for a couple of weeks now.
[01:55.170 --> 01:57.450]  This week was fucking long, bro.
[01:57.450 --> 01:59.010]  Yeah, it was a crazy week at work.
[01:59.010 --> 02:00.090]  We're both pretty tired.
[02:00.090 --> 02:02.930]  We found some time to squeeze in an episode,
[02:02.930 --> 02:05.390]  so we're trying to put one together for you.
[02:05.390 --> 02:08.050]  But as you can tell, this is a little stumbly already.
[02:08.050 --> 02:09.970]  Mike sounds like he's half asleep over there.
[02:09.970 --> 02:11.770]  It was a hell of a week.
[02:11.770 --> 02:13.450]  My brain does the thing where terps make it go,
[02:13.450 --> 02:15.850]  and I just start going faster and I wake up.
[02:15.850 --> 02:17.810]  That's how I feel like I get so much shit done.
[02:17.810 --> 02:19.330]  You guys look at me at work sometimes like,
[02:19.330 --> 02:20.850]  are you going to stop?
[02:20.850 --> 02:22.850]  Because you're going to fall over if you don't.
[02:22.850 --> 02:23.810]  But I just keep going.
[02:23.810 --> 02:26.210]  I just smoke another dab, get it done.
[02:26.210 --> 02:27.050]  Right?
[02:27.050 --> 02:28.250]  Yep.
[02:28.250 --> 02:29.370]  Oh, thanks for joining me, man.
[02:29.370 --> 02:30.210]  Thanks for joining me.
[02:30.210 --> 02:31.970]  You guys, if you want to follow Mike on social media,
[02:31.970 --> 02:34.010]  you can check him out on the Twitter.
[02:34.010 --> 02:37.130]  He's at Nemopunk15.
[02:37.130 --> 02:37.970]  Exactly.
[02:37.970 --> 02:38.790]  And then on Instagram.
[02:38.790 --> 02:40.190]  Do you even check your Instagram?
[02:40.190 --> 02:41.010]  A little bit.
[02:41.010 --> 02:41.850]  Okay, because I've tagged you
[02:41.850 --> 02:43.430]  in a couple of really killer posts.
[02:43.430 --> 02:45.710]  Yeah, most of them have been liked by me.
[02:45.710 --> 02:47.510]  On the Instagram, he's also Nemopunk15,
[02:47.510 --> 02:49.310]  but also what you should really follow
[02:49.310 --> 02:50.550]  is his Facebook page.
[02:50.550 --> 02:53.910]  On Facebook, he is Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[02:53.910 --> 02:56.070]  He supports sensible cannabis laws
[02:56.070 --> 02:58.070]  here in our town, Pueblo, Colorado.
[02:58.070 --> 02:59.150]  And you should check him out.
[02:59.150 --> 03:02.510]  He kind of trolls some other cannabis pages.
[03:02.510 --> 03:03.870]  It's been a little trolly lately.
[03:03.870 --> 03:05.710]  I'll own that one.
[03:05.710 --> 03:07.590]  But it's Mike against a whole army
[03:07.590 --> 03:09.510]  of fucking admins on these pages.
[03:09.510 --> 03:10.750]  Me against the world.
[03:10.750 --> 03:12.190]  And Mike just slays them.
[03:12.190 --> 03:13.910]  It's so awesome.
[03:13.910 --> 03:15.350]  Well, it's easy because prohibition
[03:15.350 --> 03:17.390]  is just an idiotic concept.
[03:17.390 --> 03:19.830]  So I'm starting off where it's like,
[03:19.830 --> 03:21.670]  we're playing chess, you get one pawn,
[03:21.670 --> 03:23.710]  I get all your pieces too.
[03:23.710 --> 03:25.750]  Those people are so gullible.
[03:25.750 --> 03:26.870]  But yeah, they're not very good
[03:26.870 --> 03:28.510]  at what they're trying to do.
[03:28.510 --> 03:32.150]  All passion, no willingness to do their homework.
[03:32.150 --> 03:34.750]  They're calling all the dabs green crack.
[03:34.750 --> 03:35.910]  Yep, crack weed.
[03:35.910 --> 03:37.030]  The green crack weed.
[03:37.470 --> 03:38.310]  I love it.
[03:38.310 --> 03:39.150]  When you walk into a dispensary
[03:39.150 --> 03:40.790]  and go, gotta get that crack weed,
[03:40.790 --> 03:42.990]  you get some of the best looks.
[03:42.990 --> 03:44.550]  But they're pretty sure that's our favorite
[03:44.550 --> 03:47.430]  new thing in the world is that crack weed.
[03:47.430 --> 03:48.830]  Because we need our weed fix.
[03:48.830 --> 03:49.950]  Our weed fix.
[03:49.950 --> 03:51.750]  They say it's hallucinogenic
[03:51.750 --> 03:53.470]  and it causes us to act like zombies
[03:53.470 --> 03:54.310]  and become out of control.
[03:54.310 --> 03:56.510]  Sometimes I wish some of the effects
[03:56.510 --> 03:59.230]  they prescribed to cannabis were real.
[03:59.230 --> 04:02.510]  Like, some of that sounds fun.
[04:02.510 --> 04:05.190]  Like, not all the time, but like for a long weekend.
[04:05.190 --> 04:06.990]  I think they're confused.
[04:07.790 --> 04:08.630]  I don't know if they're smoking DMT or something
[04:08.630 --> 04:09.870]  because I don't feel any of the effects
[04:09.870 --> 04:12.030]  they talk about when I smoke a dab.
[04:12.030 --> 04:14.110]  And I just took a pretty chunky dab.
[04:14.110 --> 04:18.110]  Most of it is terminology
[04:18.110 --> 04:19.230]  and where they're getting it from.
[04:19.230 --> 04:20.670]  Like, the whole psychosis thing.
[04:20.670 --> 04:24.870]  Like, being unable to accurately gauge time.
[04:24.870 --> 04:27.710]  Like, how long we've been sitting at this table.
[04:27.710 --> 04:30.550]  Can be, like, if you do that along with one
[04:30.550 --> 04:32.950]  or two other little things very similar to it,
[04:32.950 --> 04:34.870]  which we would call being stoned,
[04:35.430 --> 04:38.990]  a psychologist might call feeling the effects of psychosis.
[04:38.990 --> 04:40.190]  Because you're a little detached.
[04:40.190 --> 04:41.510]  You're not paying attention.
[04:41.510 --> 04:42.350]  Right.
[04:42.350 --> 04:43.190]  Because you're, but did that happen?
[04:43.190 --> 04:45.110]  Cheetos are funnier than they should be.
[04:45.110 --> 04:47.350]  Doesn't that happen when you drink alcohol as well?
[04:47.350 --> 04:48.350]  Well, yeah, it's just,
[04:48.350 --> 04:51.990]  they need a better word for intoxication.
[04:51.990 --> 04:54.270]  And so they came up with a number of others.
[04:54.270 --> 04:59.270]  And then a soccer mom reads it when they Google pop bad
[04:59.990 --> 05:03.870]  and they decide that, you know, people are taking a dab
[05:03.910 --> 05:07.630]  and then just losing their minds and doing the craziest shit.
[05:07.630 --> 05:10.390]  And then they spend all day looking for news articles
[05:10.390 --> 05:11.670]  that back this up.
[05:11.670 --> 05:15.070]  And I find myself in the awkward position of explaining
[05:15.070 --> 05:17.270]  that marijuana isn't this magical thing
[05:17.270 --> 05:19.350]  that prevents bad things from happening
[05:19.350 --> 05:22.150]  to people who are near it or using it.
[05:22.150 --> 05:26.230]  And that horrible things happen to people just randomly
[05:26.230 --> 05:28.190]  because that's life and life is unfair.
[05:28.190 --> 05:31.110]  And that just because you happen to be near marijuana
[05:31.110 --> 05:32.990]  when that horrible thing occurred,
[05:32.990 --> 05:36.390]  doesn't mean those two events are necessarily related.
[05:36.390 --> 05:39.310]  And yeah, it's just something that I see a lot
[05:39.310 --> 05:41.750]  that I end up like, oh, this is really touchy.
[05:41.750 --> 05:44.190]  This is a sad, tragic story.
[05:44.190 --> 05:46.630]  Like how do I separate and gently say like,
[05:46.630 --> 05:49.030]  marijuana doesn't prevent tragedy.
[05:49.030 --> 05:50.610]  But if you look at the numbers the other way,
[05:50.610 --> 05:52.710]  it's also clearly not causing it.
[05:54.630 --> 05:55.510]  Absolutely.
[05:55.510 --> 05:56.350]  Right?
[05:56.350 --> 05:57.430]  Yeah, that's a lot to digest.
[05:57.430 --> 05:58.270]  I was making sure that you did.
[05:58.270 --> 06:00.270]  There was a lot of information there and I'm pretty baked.
[06:00.270 --> 06:01.830]  I thought you had flipped one at one time.
[06:01.830 --> 06:03.550]  I thought you had said the wrong one,
[06:03.550 --> 06:04.390]  but you got it right.
[06:04.390 --> 06:05.210]  You brought it back around.
[06:05.210 --> 06:07.510]  So yes, yes, you were accurate.
[06:07.510 --> 06:08.590]  Like that's what I was doing
[06:08.590 --> 06:10.690]  before I came over to podcast actually.
[06:11.670 --> 06:13.230]  Were you thinking about that speech?
[06:13.230 --> 06:14.870]  No, I was writing it.
[06:14.870 --> 06:16.590]  There's actually a beautiful,
[06:16.590 --> 06:18.270]  I didn't plan on bringing this up on the show,
[06:18.270 --> 06:20.030]  but just because you took us there.
[06:20.030 --> 06:22.670]  There's a beautiful op-ed in the Denver Post right now
[06:22.670 --> 06:27.150]  by Jeffrey Meeren, who if you're into cannabis policy at all
[06:27.150 --> 06:31.470]  you've seen in clips like in the Culture High documentary.
[06:32.470 --> 06:35.470]  And a couple other documentaries or videos of that nature
[06:35.470 --> 06:38.030]  talking about the economics of prohibition
[06:38.030 --> 06:40.790]  and the policy from that perspective.
[06:40.790 --> 06:42.990]  He's an economics professor at Harvard
[06:44.310 --> 06:46.350]  talking about how you attack the black market
[06:46.350 --> 06:49.270]  and you can't stomp away at the black market
[06:49.270 --> 06:52.990]  because it's economically driven.
[06:52.990 --> 06:56.650]  If there's demand, there will always be supply, period.
[06:56.650 --> 06:58.430]  There's always an apartment building with some dude
[06:58.430 --> 07:01.310]  just selling five or $10 bags of weed just to get by.
[07:01.830 --> 07:04.110]  The harder you try to stomp something out,
[07:04.110 --> 07:07.670]  the more risky supplying it becomes,
[07:07.670 --> 07:10.110]  the more profitable supplying it becomes,
[07:10.110 --> 07:12.710]  the more incentivized supplying it becomes.
[07:13.630 --> 07:15.230]  The harder you try to get rid of it,
[07:15.230 --> 07:17.470]  the more you encourage people to supply it
[07:17.470 --> 07:20.230]  is essentially how it works economically.
[07:20.230 --> 07:22.550]  And with marijuana prohibition,
[07:22.550 --> 07:25.350]  you can see this in the numbers that we pay for weed
[07:25.350 --> 07:27.110]  just as consumers.
[07:27.110 --> 07:29.430]  20 years ago when we were trying a lot harder
[07:29.470 --> 07:33.030]  to stamp it out, it was a lot more expensive.
[07:33.030 --> 07:35.270]  None of us had trouble finding it or buying it
[07:35.270 --> 07:39.110]  or consuming it, but we paid a lot more to do so.
[07:39.110 --> 07:40.750]  Do you know what herb costs
[07:40.750 --> 07:42.950]  at a dispensary right now in Colorado?
[07:43.910 --> 07:46.710]  It varies so wildly from shop to shop,
[07:46.710 --> 07:50.990]  but you're paying anywhere between 25 and 55 1 8th.
[07:50.990 --> 07:54.190]  Okay, I went to Kind Love about a year ago
[07:54.190 --> 07:57.070]  and I bought a quarter and it was $75.
[07:57.070 --> 07:59.190]  And I think that's on the expensive side.
[07:59.950 --> 08:01.510]  They're one of the more bougie shops
[08:01.510 --> 08:03.670]  and they charge a little bit more.
[08:03.670 --> 08:05.350]  So it was 75 for a quarter.
[08:05.350 --> 08:07.590]  80 percentile of price range.
[08:07.590 --> 08:11.750]  I remember a time when it was 120, 125 a quarter
[08:11.750 --> 08:14.910]  and your quarter would weigh six and a half grams.
[08:14.910 --> 08:16.230]  I used to have to tell people
[08:16.230 --> 08:18.830]  that it was 120 something, something, something.
[08:18.830 --> 08:22.710]  I don't remember the 120 whatever and change.
[08:22.710 --> 08:27.390]  But then I would say, and with tax that comes to,
[08:27.390 --> 08:29.070]  and then I'd have to hit them with that number
[08:29.950 --> 08:31.430]  and so it was like 140 and change.
[08:31.430 --> 08:32.950]  And people would look at me and be like,
[08:32.950 --> 08:37.110]  well it's legal, I don't mind paying an extra 46 bucks
[08:37.110 --> 08:40.310]  over what I'd pay back in Texas or wherever
[08:40.310 --> 08:42.150]  and they'd just throw down their money and roll.
[08:42.150 --> 08:44.230]  Yeah, well when you're shopping at the dispensary,
[08:44.230 --> 08:45.430]  you don't mind paying the taxes.
[08:45.430 --> 08:46.870]  There's a security guard looking at you,
[08:46.870 --> 08:49.550]  making sure you're not getting robbed by anybody else.
[08:49.550 --> 08:51.590]  There's a guy weighing it in front of you.
[08:51.590 --> 08:52.990]  You know it's gonna weigh.
[08:52.990 --> 08:54.550]  That's one of the best parts of the dispensary.
[08:54.550 --> 08:56.270]  You know you're gonna get a seven gram quarter.
[08:56.270 --> 08:59.990]  A lot more for that tax money.
[08:59.990 --> 09:01.190]  Yeah, the safety.
[09:01.190 --> 09:05.630]  The selection, lab testing, consistency, quality,
[09:05.630 --> 09:06.710]  ease of purchase.
[09:06.710 --> 09:07.710]  You don't have to sit there and watch
[09:07.710 --> 09:09.790]  how it's made for two hours.
[09:09.790 --> 09:10.790]  You don't have to sit there and listen
[09:10.790 --> 09:12.790]  to his new ukulele solo.
[09:12.790 --> 09:14.950]  Bro, check out this fish video, man.
[09:14.950 --> 09:16.390]  Nah, bro, nah, I know you want a bag, man.
[09:16.390 --> 09:17.630]  I'll get your bag in a minute, man.
[09:17.630 --> 09:19.350]  Watch this fish solo, man.
[09:19.350 --> 09:21.910]  Watch Trey tear it up, man.
[09:21.910 --> 09:22.750]  So bro, I don't mean to be rude.
[09:22.750 --> 09:24.390]  No man, watch the video, man.
[09:24.390 --> 09:25.230]  Come on, man.
[09:25.230 --> 09:27.070]  I'm talking over fish, man.
[09:27.070 --> 09:28.070]  Come on, man.
[09:28.070 --> 09:29.670]  Trey's doing it, man.
[09:30.510 --> 09:32.150]  I don't miss those days at all.
[09:32.150 --> 09:34.030]  No, you don't miss college, trying to buy weed?
[09:34.030 --> 09:35.230]  Or just set it up.
[09:35.230 --> 09:37.710]  Hey man, can I just swing by after work?
[09:37.710 --> 09:38.990]  Like it's been a long week.
[09:38.990 --> 09:39.990]  I'd really appreciate it.
[09:39.990 --> 09:40.830]  Are you sure?
[09:40.830 --> 09:42.150]  I'll be by like 9.30.
[09:42.150 --> 09:44.270]  You walk in the door and you get the,
[09:44.270 --> 09:46.550]  all right bro, so my down the hall neighbor
[09:46.550 --> 09:48.430]  has been kind of bitchy lately.
[09:48.430 --> 09:52.550]  So if you could hang out for at least an hour and 20,
[09:52.590 --> 09:55.590]  like I'd really, it's Friday night.
[09:55.590 --> 09:57.310]  I just want to get a weed and go home.
[09:57.310 --> 09:58.950]  I want to get this sandwich and take a poo.
[09:58.950 --> 09:59.790]  Sure.
[09:59.790 --> 10:00.630]  On Friday.
[10:00.630 --> 10:02.190]  What are we going to do for an hour and 20?
[10:02.190 --> 10:04.510]  Oh, we're going to watch cops?
[10:04.510 --> 10:05.350]  Really?
[10:05.350 --> 10:06.170]  Again?
[10:06.170 --> 10:08.670]  Oh, and we're going to smoke my weed while we, fuck.
[10:10.030 --> 10:11.590]  Like I don't miss that at all.
[10:11.590 --> 10:14.310]  Pull over into the parking lot
[10:14.310 --> 10:15.870]  like you do at any of the store.
[10:15.870 --> 10:17.990]  Walk in like you do at any of the store.
[10:17.990 --> 10:20.350]  Point at what you want like at any of the store.
[10:20.350 --> 10:22.190]  Pay for it like at any of the store.
[10:22.830 --> 10:24.390]  Take a home like at any of the store.
[10:24.390 --> 10:27.030]  There's no part of the black market I miss.
[10:27.030 --> 10:28.030]  Yeah.
[10:28.030 --> 10:29.870]  Man, at least when I was that guy back in the day,
[10:29.870 --> 10:30.830]  because I used to be that guy.
[10:30.830 --> 10:31.990]  Nah man, you should hang out man,
[10:31.990 --> 10:33.390]  for at least like 30 minutes man,
[10:33.390 --> 10:34.610]  but I would just keep packing bowls.
[10:34.610 --> 10:35.990]  That's how I would get you to stay.
[10:35.990 --> 10:38.230]  That'd just get you so high you can't leave.
[10:38.230 --> 10:39.270]  Like, yep.
[10:39.270 --> 10:40.710]  I don't want to look like a loafing jug.
[10:40.710 --> 10:42.550]  There were a lot of different ways to do it.
[10:42.550 --> 10:44.950]  Like I knew one dude who was always making
[10:44.950 --> 10:46.710]  like grub little snacks.
[10:46.710 --> 10:48.630]  Like it wasn't just like you want some chips.
[10:48.630 --> 10:51.430]  It was always like celery with peanut butter
[10:51.430 --> 10:53.110]  with raisins sprinkled over it.
[10:53.110 --> 10:55.030]  Like it was always like the next step.
[10:55.030 --> 10:56.190]  Ants on a log bro?
[10:56.190 --> 10:57.030]  Yeah, full on dude.
[10:57.030 --> 10:58.110]  Man, I would buy weed from that guy
[10:58.110 --> 10:59.710]  just because he had ants on a log with it.
[10:59.710 --> 11:01.310]  It was a she and it was wonderful.
[11:01.310 --> 11:02.550]  Oh yeah, of course.
[11:02.550 --> 11:03.990]  Of course, the ladies take good care of us
[11:03.990 --> 11:05.670]  and try to feed us snacks and take good care of us,
[11:05.670 --> 11:06.510]  keep us nourished.
[11:06.510 --> 11:08.430]  Shout out to the ladies taking care of the men feeding us.
[11:08.430 --> 11:10.110]  It was always a little healthy snack wise,
[11:10.110 --> 11:12.630]  but it was always a really nice treat.
[11:12.630 --> 11:15.110]  And if you got to sit and chill somewhere for that long,
[11:15.110 --> 11:16.310]  might as well have some grub.
[11:16.310 --> 11:17.150]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:17.150 --> 11:17.990]  Because a guy would be like,
[11:17.990 --> 11:20.270]  I got pizza and a scent and a beer bro.
[11:20.270 --> 11:21.110]  Right.
[11:21.750 --> 11:23.150]  The ladies got some ants on a log for you.
[11:23.150 --> 11:25.310]  There's two warm beers next to the fridge, man.
[11:25.310 --> 11:26.150]  You could have one.
[11:26.150 --> 11:27.270]  Yuck.
[11:27.270 --> 11:29.030]  That might eat that crust though, man.
[11:29.030 --> 11:30.790]  Do that pizza crust.
[11:30.790 --> 11:31.950]  The fuck did we smoke bro?
[11:31.950 --> 11:32.790]  We're weird today.
[11:32.790 --> 11:34.150]  Oh, it was a lot of hash.
[11:34.150 --> 11:35.470]  Dude, it was a really long week.
[11:35.470 --> 11:36.710]  We crushed it this week,
[11:36.710 --> 11:40.830]  but God invented weekends for a reason
[11:40.830 --> 11:42.670]  so we can recover from weeks like this.
[11:42.670 --> 11:43.750]  Yeah, yeah.
[11:43.750 --> 11:44.590]  It's going to be a good weekend.
[11:44.590 --> 11:46.750]  I get to humble brag, I guess tomorrow.
[11:46.750 --> 11:48.190]  I got to work a little bit tomorrow.
[11:48.190 --> 11:51.030]  Got to go into the grill and handle a couple of small things,
[11:51.910 --> 11:54.110]  but then I have a lot of small things that are clones.
[11:54.110 --> 11:55.230]  It's a whole bunch of small things.
[11:55.230 --> 11:56.470]  Whole tray of tiny things.
[11:56.470 --> 11:58.430]  But I got to go take care of a bunch of clones.
[11:58.430 --> 12:00.150]  And then I'm going to come home and clean up
[12:00.150 --> 12:02.510]  and chill out for a few and head up to Denver.
[12:02.510 --> 12:04.510]  And I'm going to go see the awesome
[12:04.510 --> 12:06.190]  Steve Simone at Comedy Works.
[12:06.190 --> 12:07.910]  If anybody listens to the show frequently,
[12:07.910 --> 12:10.710]  they know me, they know how much of a comedy fan I am.
[12:10.710 --> 12:12.950]  And if you know Steve Simone,
[12:12.950 --> 12:14.750]  Steve Simone doesn't use much profanity.
[12:14.750 --> 12:16.870]  He's a really good, smiley, positive dude.
[12:16.870 --> 12:18.790]  He's got a good, positive attitude.
[12:18.790 --> 12:20.230]  He just puts me in a good mood.
[12:20.230 --> 12:24.350]  The dude can do, I'd say an hour, two hours on Chinese food.
[12:24.350 --> 12:26.230]  He's got a bit about Chinese food.
[12:26.230 --> 12:27.750]  Like, it's a really good bit.
[12:27.750 --> 12:30.430]  I don't want to burn it and do it a disjustice here.
[12:30.430 --> 12:32.950]  But Google Steve Simone, it's spelled funny.
[12:32.950 --> 12:37.430]  S-I-M, I'm trying to, it's Simeone is what it looks like.
[12:37.430 --> 12:40.950]  But it's Steve Simone, S-I-M-E-O-N-E.
[12:40.950 --> 12:42.790]  S-I-M, I'm not sure anymore.
[12:42.790 --> 12:43.990]  Question for Google.
[12:43.990 --> 12:45.790]  Yeah, Google Steve Simone.
[12:45.790 --> 12:47.670]  Google will help you out, but he's going to be funny.
[12:47.670 --> 12:49.430]  It'll be the dude who looks funny.
[12:50.390 --> 12:51.230]  Yeah, yeah.
[12:51.230 --> 12:53.950]  The big Italian dude with the big head and the big smile.
[12:53.950 --> 12:55.470]  He's fucking hilarious.
[12:55.470 --> 12:56.870]  He doesn't use any profanity.
[12:56.870 --> 12:58.950]  He's got a podcast called Good Times with Steve Simone.
[12:58.950 --> 13:01.910]  It's produced and co-hosted by the good dude, Lee Syatt.
[13:01.910 --> 13:03.510]  I like that guy a lot.
[13:03.510 --> 13:04.350]  But yeah, I'm stoked.
[13:04.350 --> 13:05.230]  I get to go see some comedy.
[13:05.230 --> 13:09.910]  It's going to be the beginning of like the summer of chaos.
[13:09.910 --> 13:10.990]  It's about to start for me.
[13:10.990 --> 13:14.150]  I've got one, two, three comedy shows,
[13:14.150 --> 13:16.150]  then three fish shows in a row.
[13:16.150 --> 13:21.150]  And then another comedy show between now and September 4th.
[13:22.750 --> 13:23.790]  It's a lot, man.
[13:23.790 --> 13:24.750]  It's going to be fun.
[13:24.750 --> 13:26.110]  It's going to be a lot of miles on the car,
[13:26.110 --> 13:27.430]  but it's going to be a good time.
[13:27.430 --> 13:30.230]  I've got nothing planned until one evening in December,
[13:30.230 --> 13:32.070]  and then I've got nothing planned till Christmas.
[13:32.070 --> 13:33.750]  December.
[13:33.750 --> 13:35.390]  Kevin Smith's coming to Pueblo, bro.
[13:35.390 --> 13:38.510]  It's, but it's not even, it's September right now.
[13:38.510 --> 13:40.430]  I know, I've got a two-year-old.
[13:40.430 --> 13:41.990]  Okay, well, then you've got a lot of cool shit
[13:41.990 --> 13:42.830]  to look forward to.
[13:42.830 --> 13:44.870]  Get home, make sure there's laundry for tomorrow clean.
[13:44.870 --> 13:48.150]  Like, that's like the big doing stuff
[13:48.150 --> 13:50.190]  night of my week right now.
[13:50.190 --> 13:52.870]  Yeah, I live the Malamute lifestyle.
[13:52.870 --> 13:55.150]  I take some of that with me wherever I go.
[13:55.150 --> 13:57.390]  I smell like weed and I trail dog hair.
[13:57.390 --> 13:59.630]  That's what you get when you order me.
[13:59.630 --> 14:00.550]  When you order a mic,
[14:00.550 --> 14:02.750]  he comes with half of a Malamute attached to him.
[14:02.750 --> 14:04.070]  There's just no other way to be.
[14:04.070 --> 14:06.070]  And I got some Mick the dog fur on me, I'm pretty sure.
[14:06.070 --> 14:07.110]  Shout out to Mick the dog.
[14:07.110 --> 14:08.990]  If anybody's listened to the podcast for a long time,
[14:08.990 --> 14:11.230]  they remember the time I kicked Mick the dog on the show.
[14:11.230 --> 14:12.190]  I got emails about it.
[14:12.190 --> 14:13.790]  I'm fucking sorry, man.
[14:13.790 --> 14:14.830]  He was under the table, bro.
[14:14.830 --> 14:16.790]  He kept moving and I moved my foot and I got him.
[14:16.790 --> 14:18.350]  And you could hear a little,
[14:18.350 --> 14:19.590]  a little whimper on the show.
[14:19.590 --> 14:21.070]  And I was like, I'm fucking sorry.
[14:21.070 --> 14:23.030]  Don't call PETA.
[14:23.030 --> 14:24.350]  The show's produced really well.
[14:24.350 --> 14:25.590]  These mics are awesome.
[14:25.590 --> 14:28.430]  Yeah, and it heard me stomp on Mick the dog on accident.
[14:28.430 --> 14:29.630]  Sorry, buddy.
[14:29.630 --> 14:30.470]  He's a good boy though.
[14:30.470 --> 14:32.590]  He jumped up into my lap the last time we hung out.
[14:32.590 --> 14:34.550]  Like, just cuddled up in my lap like a little,
[14:34.550 --> 14:35.950]  I don't know, he felt like a little fucking kangaroo
[14:35.950 --> 14:36.790]  laying in my lap.
[14:36.790 --> 14:37.630]  It was really funny.
[14:37.630 --> 14:39.390]  I don't know how people don't have dogs.
[14:39.390 --> 14:42.750]  Like, I don't have a dog of my own
[14:42.750 --> 14:44.710]  because I'm in too many grows
[14:44.710 --> 14:47.670]  and I don't like my grow hair, my dog.
[14:47.670 --> 14:48.790]  I know, but like, you're dog people.
[14:48.790 --> 14:49.630]  If you could, you would.
[14:49.630 --> 14:50.990]  If I just go to other people's houses
[14:50.990 --> 14:51.830]  and just, then I get,
[14:51.830 --> 14:53.230]  I don't have to pick up shit or buy food.
[14:53.230 --> 14:54.910]  And I get to play with doggos all the time.
[14:54.910 --> 14:56.630]  And dogs like me, because I'm just a hippie.
[14:56.630 --> 14:57.550]  I don't have to go hippie at heart
[14:57.550 --> 14:58.390]  and they come up to me and they're like,
[14:58.390 --> 15:00.310]  oh, yeah, look at you.
[15:00.310 --> 15:01.590]  No, gotta have one.
[15:02.670 --> 15:04.910]  Yeah, I'm a little crushed after my dog died.
[15:04.910 --> 15:05.750]  I don't want to do that again.
[15:05.750 --> 15:07.030]  Yeah, that was rough.
[15:07.030 --> 15:08.230]  Yeah, I don't want to do that again.
[15:08.230 --> 15:10.270]  It takes a while to get back at it.
[15:10.270 --> 15:11.110]  Yeah.
[15:11.110 --> 15:11.950]  It'll happen.
[15:12.670 --> 15:14.030]  I know maybe it's a shitty attitude
[15:14.030 --> 15:15.710]  that I know that about 10 years after I get it,
[15:15.710 --> 15:17.110]  I got to feel that way again.
[15:17.110 --> 15:19.590]  Oh, my dog died again.
[15:19.590 --> 15:21.670]  That was like one of the shittiest feelings.
[15:21.670 --> 15:22.510]  Yeah.
[15:22.510 --> 15:24.910]  Yeah, I can dodge that by not doing that again.
[15:26.790 --> 15:28.830]  Just go play with everyone else's dogs.
[15:28.830 --> 15:29.670]  Yeah.
[15:29.670 --> 15:30.510]  Fair enough.
[15:30.510 --> 15:32.670]  Welcome to the Grow From Your Dog podcast.
[15:32.670 --> 15:36.310]  Yeah, this podcast is brought to you by Hash.
[15:36.310 --> 15:38.350]  It's a good thing they like it when we ramble.
[15:38.350 --> 15:40.870]  The hashtag, yes, they like it when we ramble.
[15:41.430 --> 15:43.110]  I'm gonna suggest we take another dab
[15:43.110 --> 15:45.550]  before we get into whatever topic you have lined up.
[15:45.550 --> 15:46.390]  I'm gonna take another dab,
[15:46.390 --> 15:48.030]  but while we get it lined up here,
[15:48.030 --> 15:51.190]  let's talk a little bit about what I wanted to talk about.
[15:51.190 --> 15:52.590]  Let's kind of give it a little preset
[15:52.590 --> 15:54.030]  so that we can fucking talk about it
[15:54.030 --> 15:54.870]  before we lose our shit.
[15:54.870 --> 15:55.690]  Shout out to Nancy Budwell.
[15:55.690 --> 15:56.990]  She asked me a question on Facebook.
[15:56.990 --> 15:58.350]  She is a great grower.
[15:58.350 --> 16:00.430]  Should be following Nancy Budwell.
[16:00.430 --> 16:01.510]  Some great photography from Nancy Budwell.
[16:01.510 --> 16:02.870]  She just sent me a Facebook message.
[16:02.870 --> 16:03.710]  My phone just lit up.
[16:03.710 --> 16:04.790]  We were having a great conversation.
[16:04.790 --> 16:07.150]  She does some beautiful photography.
[16:07.150 --> 16:09.070]  Beautiful photography.
[16:09.070 --> 16:10.990]  She hasn't been growing for super long,
[16:10.990 --> 16:13.070]  but the amount of time that she grew has been growing.
[16:13.070 --> 16:14.790]  Holy crap, she came up really fast.
[16:14.790 --> 16:16.030]  Good job, Nancy.
[16:16.030 --> 16:17.710]  So I wanted to talk about,
[16:17.710 --> 16:19.870]  so people think like you work in a commercial grow.
[16:19.870 --> 16:20.990]  You grow weed all day.
[16:20.990 --> 16:22.750]  You must be smoking weed all day.
[16:22.750 --> 16:24.590]  You're just hanging out listening to Bob Marley
[16:24.590 --> 16:26.830]  with a fucking spliff blazing.
[16:26.830 --> 16:28.630]  You got the fucking air conditioner on.
[16:28.630 --> 16:29.950]  You're on a sofa.
[16:29.950 --> 16:31.490]  You got cushy chairs.
[16:31.490 --> 16:33.150]  Right, when people hear legal weed,
[16:33.150 --> 16:35.870]  they tend to picture in their head
[16:35.870 --> 16:38.230]  where they bought weed in college
[16:38.230 --> 16:41.750]  being a profession now.
[16:41.750 --> 16:44.710]  And that is not at all the case.
[16:44.710 --> 16:45.550]  No.
[16:47.050 --> 16:49.670]  I've shuffled more paperwork now than I have
[16:49.670 --> 16:50.710]  any other job. Dude, paperwork is the
[16:50.710 --> 16:52.950]  fucking word I have written down on my list
[16:52.950 --> 16:54.870]  to think about, to talk about.
[16:54.870 --> 16:59.190]  In the past, I've worked with locked up teenagers.
[16:59.190 --> 17:01.610]  I worked for NIDA as a subcontractor.
[17:02.670 --> 17:05.030]  I've had some major jobs that required
[17:05.030 --> 17:06.750]  insane amounts of record keeping
[17:06.750 --> 17:08.270]  and regulation and rule following.
[17:08.270 --> 17:10.030]  And we've never had anywhere close
[17:10.030 --> 17:13.190]  to the level of paperwork I have at this place.
[17:13.190 --> 17:15.150]  Sometimes people are like, so what'd you do today?
[17:15.150 --> 17:17.730]  And I'm like, well, I put 100 clones
[17:17.730 --> 17:20.430]  from the clone dome into pots.
[17:20.430 --> 17:21.830]  And they're like, 100?
[17:21.830 --> 17:23.470]  I'm like, oh yeah, but I had to write down
[17:23.470 --> 17:26.510]  every single one and an RFID tag number
[17:26.510 --> 17:28.390]  and a mother plant number and the date
[17:28.390 --> 17:31.110]  and the name of the strain, excuse me,
[17:31.110 --> 17:33.430]  on multiple sheets of paper.
[17:33.430 --> 17:36.030]  One for us and one for the,
[17:36.030 --> 17:38.830]  it's called the Department of Ag slash Metric.
[17:38.830 --> 17:42.110]  The marijuana something tracking some stuff.
[17:42.110 --> 17:43.990]  But I have to write down a copy for us
[17:43.990 --> 17:45.870]  and then we have to document it for Metric.
[17:45.870 --> 17:48.270]  And then I have to make a sticker for each plant.
[17:48.270 --> 17:49.870]  And there is so much paperwork.
[17:49.870 --> 17:51.870]  And then after I, so I write down
[17:51.870 --> 17:55.590]  that I've just put whatever, we'll say 25 Blue Dream.
[17:55.590 --> 17:57.310]  Let's pick Blue Dream, fuck Blue Dream.
[17:57.310 --> 18:00.390]  I just took 25 Blue Dream clones from the clone dome
[18:00.390 --> 18:02.830]  into, they go into four by four square pots
[18:02.830 --> 18:04.310]  with a soilless mix.
[18:04.310 --> 18:06.210]  So I'm throwing that into there.
[18:06.210 --> 18:08.350]  I've gotta write down, I just did 25 of these.
[18:08.350 --> 18:11.670]  They came from mother plant number 5653.
[18:11.670 --> 18:12.710]  I'm making shit up.
[18:12.710 --> 18:15.030]  I did it on, the date was 7-10.
[18:15.030 --> 18:18.350]  And then Mike has to go put those into the computer.
[18:18.350 --> 18:19.190]  And then.
[18:19.190 --> 18:21.910]  So first we write it down on a sheet of paper.
[18:21.910 --> 18:23.790]  Because I'm in a whole other area.
[18:23.790 --> 18:27.470]  Then we take that and transfer it into a computer system.
[18:27.470 --> 18:30.190]  Then we actually physically do that with the plant.
[18:30.190 --> 18:32.470]  Like it's just, there's three steps
[18:32.470 --> 18:34.270]  when there's only one necessary.
[18:35.730 --> 18:37.910]  If y'all ever watch the show Moonshiners,
[18:37.910 --> 18:41.030]  there's an episode where fucknutsintheoveralls
[18:41.030 --> 18:42.030]  is trying to get legal.
[18:42.030 --> 18:45.390]  Fucknutsintheoveralls on the Moonshine show.
[18:45.390 --> 18:47.230]  Yeah, that narrows it down to the.
[18:47.230 --> 18:48.930]  I know that narrows the cast way down.
[18:48.930 --> 18:51.030]  But they're talking about getting legal
[18:51.030 --> 18:54.070]  and he's getting his legal Moonshine business up and running.
[18:54.070 --> 18:54.910]  His name was Tim.
[18:54.910 --> 18:55.730]  It was Tim.
[18:55.730 --> 18:56.570]  Tim, yep.
[18:56.570 --> 18:57.410]  You know who I'm talking about.
[18:57.410 --> 18:58.230]  His buddy was Tickle.
[18:58.230 --> 18:59.750]  The whole episode, Pickle.
[18:59.750 --> 19:00.590]  Tickle.
[19:00.590 --> 19:01.430]  Was it Tickle?
[19:01.430 --> 19:02.250]  It was Tickle.
[19:02.930 --> 19:04.210]  The show is totally fake,
[19:04.210 --> 19:06.770]  but the little story they were trying to tell
[19:06.770 --> 19:08.410]  was at least plausible.
[19:08.410 --> 19:11.490]  But the whole gripe during the going legal section
[19:11.490 --> 19:13.730]  was how much paperwork is involved.
[19:13.730 --> 19:15.650]  Like I'm just used to doing it.
[19:15.650 --> 19:17.530]  Why do I gotta write it down four times?
[19:17.530 --> 19:19.090]  And it's like because it's legal now.
[19:19.090 --> 19:20.490]  Yeah, we have to.
[19:20.490 --> 19:23.130]  Let's list off the agencies that oversee us.
[19:23.130 --> 19:24.870]  There's the Department of Revenue.
[19:24.870 --> 19:27.290]  There's the Marijuana Enforcement Division.
[19:27.290 --> 19:29.290]  There's the Department of Agriculture.
[19:29.290 --> 19:31.170]  There's the IRS.
[19:31.170 --> 19:35.010]  There's state, local, and federal law enforcement agencies.
[19:35.010 --> 19:35.850]  The Fire Department.
[19:35.850 --> 19:37.410]  The Fire Department.
[19:37.410 --> 19:38.250]  The Health Department.
[19:38.250 --> 19:40.210]  The Health Department.
[19:40.210 --> 19:41.370]  The Building Inspectors.
[19:41.370 --> 19:42.190]  Yep.
[19:42.190 --> 19:44.090]  Code Enforcement, which is the Building Inspector.
[19:44.090 --> 19:46.330]  City Code Enforcement or County Code Enforcement,
[19:46.330 --> 19:48.210]  depending on your location.
[19:48.210 --> 19:49.050]  That's eight.
[19:50.010 --> 19:53.450]  And that's yearly inspections, quarterly inspections,
[19:53.450 --> 19:58.450]  monthly trainings, policy change memos,
[19:58.490 --> 20:00.050]  rule book updates.
[20:00.050 --> 20:01.690]  From all of them, all eight of them.
[20:01.690 --> 20:05.050]  Like there's so much involved with being legal,
[20:05.050 --> 20:06.890]  just like any other legal business.
[20:09.290 --> 20:11.490]  I imagine some of this is true,
[20:11.490 --> 20:13.370]  like if you're trying to open a taco truck
[20:13.370 --> 20:15.130]  from just driving around selling burritos
[20:15.130 --> 20:17.490]  out of the back of your Subaru.
[20:17.490 --> 20:19.610]  But like with legal cannabis,
[20:19.610 --> 20:21.690]  we went so overboard with a lot of the rules
[20:21.690 --> 20:25.570]  and regulations that sometimes we have to stop
[20:25.570 --> 20:28.130]  and note shit in the system that happens in the same room.
[20:28.170 --> 20:29.210]  Like we didn't do anything,
[20:29.210 --> 20:31.050]  but like changed the container it was in.
[20:31.050 --> 20:33.470]  Oh, and if we move a plant from one spot to another,
[20:33.470 --> 20:34.490]  we gotta mark that too.
[20:34.490 --> 20:37.890]  If it's in a certain spot in the room or a certain area.
[20:37.890 --> 20:40.810]  Some facilities have little RFID tags and little trackers
[20:40.810 --> 20:42.610]  so that if you move through a certain area,
[20:42.610 --> 20:44.210]  it just tags it for you and the plant knows
[20:44.210 --> 20:46.970]  that now you went from room A to room B.
[20:46.970 --> 20:48.430]  But we don't really have that yet,
[20:48.430 --> 20:49.570]  but we will in the future.
[20:49.570 --> 20:51.610]  I don't know if that's even necessary.
[20:51.610 --> 20:54.330]  It's not necessary, but it would be nice.
[20:54.330 --> 20:56.490]  It would save three steps.
[20:56.490 --> 20:57.690]  Yeah, it would save clicks.
[20:58.210 --> 20:59.050]  It would save you having to click
[20:59.050 --> 21:00.850]  when you do 150 plants at a time.
[21:00.850 --> 21:01.930]  Yeah, there is so much paperwork
[21:01.930 --> 21:03.250]  in a commercial grow, you guys.
[21:03.250 --> 21:05.090]  And that's just the start of it.
[21:05.090 --> 21:07.410]  There was a saying that was going around a lot
[21:07.410 --> 21:10.610]  during the election season in this area last year
[21:10.610 --> 21:12.810]  that we're in the compliance business.
[21:12.810 --> 21:15.010]  And if we do that well, we get to sell weed.
[21:16.290 --> 21:18.370]  And I agree 100% with that.
[21:18.370 --> 21:19.650]  Most of what we do all day
[21:19.650 --> 21:21.730]  is compliance and regulation oriented.
[21:22.850 --> 21:25.450]  The smallest amount of our tasks every day
[21:25.450 --> 21:28.130]  are production and distribution of marijuana related.
[21:28.130 --> 21:30.210]  Yes, all of our waste.
[21:30.210 --> 21:31.610]  So imagine you harvest a plant.
[21:31.610 --> 21:33.210]  Mike just starts laughing.
[21:33.210 --> 21:34.050]  Like, oh shit.
[21:34.050 --> 21:36.530]  Okay, so your average marijuana plant
[21:36.530 --> 21:38.930]  in a production facility is probably gonna weigh in
[21:38.930 --> 21:39.770]  somewhere around.
[21:39.770 --> 21:41.050]  Wait, in our facility.
[21:41.050 --> 21:42.250]  I don't know what the hell they're doing
[21:42.250 --> 21:43.130]  in any other facility.
[21:43.130 --> 21:44.450]  I don't wanna talk to them.
[21:45.850 --> 21:48.610]  I mean, yeah, in our facility,
[21:48.610 --> 21:53.090]  you're looking at several, like 1,200, 2,000 grams,
[21:53.090 --> 21:53.970]  3,000 grams.
[21:53.970 --> 21:55.330]  When the plant first gets cut down,
[21:56.210 --> 21:57.050]  it starts to get wet, it starts to get wet weight.
[21:57.050 --> 22:00.050]  When it's fully harvested and bag ready,
[22:00.050 --> 22:01.810]  you might have 300 grams.
[22:02.690 --> 22:05.090]  And the difference there,
[22:05.090 --> 22:06.690]  all of that has to be accounted for,
[22:06.690 --> 22:09.170]  even though most of it's water weight.
[22:09.170 --> 22:12.210]  And then whatever physical hard trash you have left,
[22:12.210 --> 22:15.090]  like the stems, the dried up fan leaves, all of that,
[22:15.090 --> 22:18.050]  you have to make unrecognizable as plant matter.
[22:18.050 --> 22:21.250]  Not as marijuana, but as plant matter.
[22:21.250 --> 22:22.810]  It's got to be destroyed.
[22:22.850 --> 22:24.650]  Next time y'all mow your lawn,
[22:25.570 --> 22:28.050]  that big pile of grass clippings you get at the end,
[22:28.050 --> 22:32.010]  imagine if you had to make that not appear like plant matter
[22:32.010 --> 22:34.250]  in your trash can at the end of the day.
[22:34.250 --> 22:38.090]  Now imagine that we haul out like 40 bags like that a week.
[22:39.770 --> 22:42.450]  Just throwing away our trash is a nightmare.
[22:42.450 --> 22:45.970]  So we, there's several ways to make it unrecognizable.
[22:45.970 --> 22:49.250]  A lot of the leaf stuff we'll mix in with old dirt or cocoa
[22:49.250 --> 22:50.170]  or old perlite.
[22:50.170 --> 22:51.970]  We'll just mix it in with the bag and stir it up
[22:51.970 --> 22:53.130]  so now it's like mulched in there
[22:53.130 --> 22:54.290]  with all the leaves and the dirt.
[22:54.290 --> 22:56.450]  So that's unrecognizable, that's destroyed.
[22:56.450 --> 22:58.010]  But the sticks, you can't really do that.
[22:58.010 --> 23:01.050]  So we run all the sticks through an actual wood chipper.
[23:01.050 --> 23:04.330]  On the weekend, we got a guy, a strapping young lad,
[23:04.330 --> 23:05.730]  will fire up a big wood chipper,
[23:05.730 --> 23:08.130]  like an industrial grade chipper, and run sticks.
[23:10.210 --> 23:12.650]  He takes half the shift to do it.
[23:12.650 --> 23:13.690]  And he'll just chip it up all day.
[23:13.690 --> 23:16.850]  So that stuff, all of the unrecognizable waste,
[23:16.850 --> 23:21.850]  then has to be locked in an approved locked trash can.
[23:22.050 --> 23:23.610]  Dumpster inspections, y'all.
[23:23.610 --> 23:26.050]  Yeah, dumpster, your dumpster has to be inspected.
[23:26.050 --> 23:27.370]  It's gotta have a padlock on it.
[23:27.370 --> 23:29.690]  You can't be able to break into it.
[23:29.690 --> 23:31.170]  The dumpster gets inspected, guys.
[23:31.170 --> 23:33.370]  And all of that's because some fucking tweaker
[23:33.370 --> 23:36.130]  went on the news way back when and was like,
[23:36.130 --> 23:39.170]  what we do for money is break into dispensary dumpsters
[23:39.170 --> 23:40.830]  and blast their trash.
[23:42.050 --> 23:44.390]  And the press ran with that nonsense.
[23:44.390 --> 23:46.670]  We all knew it was nonsense when it aired,
[23:46.670 --> 23:49.170]  but the rest of the world didn't.
[23:49.170 --> 23:51.250]  And so now we have a special rule
[23:51.290 --> 23:52.730]  where every couple of months,
[23:52.730 --> 23:54.930]  an inspector comes out and digs through our garbage
[23:54.930 --> 23:57.570]  to make sure none of it looks like plant.
[23:57.570 --> 24:01.090]  Like it's just, legalization's a totally different level.
[24:01.090 --> 24:04.410]  I've actually broken into, I've worked at three facilities
[24:04.410 --> 24:07.090]  and all of them have had the trash broken into
[24:07.090 --> 24:08.330]  at least once.
[24:08.330 --> 24:10.930]  Bad press makes people think there might be something
[24:10.930 --> 24:12.890]  in there worth trying to get at.
[24:12.890 --> 24:14.970]  Green and Healthy, the girl was down at the end of an alley
[24:14.970 --> 24:17.690]  and they would break into that fucking thing once a week.
[24:17.690 --> 24:18.650]  Like once a week.
[24:18.650 --> 24:20.090]  We probably didn't even need trash service.
[24:20.090 --> 24:21.650]  We probably could have just canceled the dumpster
[24:21.650 --> 24:23.690]  because they would just come get our shit every week.
[24:23.690 --> 24:25.410]  And it was, there's a bunch of dudes that work there
[24:25.410 --> 24:27.570]  and our favorite thing to do is eat Thai food.
[24:27.570 --> 24:30.210]  We would all order Thai food together and just fucking,
[24:30.210 --> 24:31.850]  it was just all Thai food trash.
[24:31.850 --> 24:33.250]  What do they think we're gonna throw away?
[24:33.250 --> 24:35.170]  Like weed?
[24:35.170 --> 24:37.230]  Or we're in the weed business.
[24:37.230 --> 24:40.370]  Right, like anything usable is either getting sold or-
[24:40.370 --> 24:41.210]  Extracted.
[24:41.210 --> 24:42.030]  Extracted.
[24:42.030 --> 24:43.370]  Yeah, if anything's gonna happen,
[24:43.370 --> 24:44.370]  it's not gonna go in the dumpster.
[24:44.370 --> 24:46.130]  One of the dipshit trimmers would probably steal it
[24:46.130 --> 24:47.530]  or something before they throw it away.
[24:47.530 --> 24:49.650]  Why would, like, why do they think it's even gonna make it
[24:50.210 --> 24:51.050]  to the trash?
[24:51.050 --> 24:53.990]  The only place that works is like restaurants, guys.
[24:55.010 --> 24:56.730]  You don't go through the trash at the mall
[24:56.730 --> 24:57.850]  looking for Levi's.
[24:59.010 --> 25:00.290]  Mike, you're the winner.
[25:00.290 --> 25:03.090]  You don't go through the trash looking for Levi's.
[25:03.090 --> 25:04.090]  No.
[25:04.090 --> 25:06.410]  You might find a sandwich or a half a pretzel.
[25:06.410 --> 25:09.050]  Yeah, like, you might find food.
[25:09.050 --> 25:09.890]  Might be some Sbarro in there.
[25:09.890 --> 25:13.730]  You're not gonna find useful products from a business.
[25:14.810 --> 25:16.010]  Yeah, we are pretty high, aren't we?
[25:16.010 --> 25:17.250]  You said dab, I took a dab.
[25:17.250 --> 25:19.210]  Let me get you a dab here.
[25:19.770 --> 25:21.050]  We're smoking a little bit of this.
[25:21.050 --> 25:22.610]  It's gonna be that kind of show, folks.
[25:22.610 --> 25:23.810]  If you are hoping to learn a lot
[25:23.810 --> 25:25.450]  about growing cannabis this episode,
[25:25.450 --> 25:27.770]  feel free to send Heymail to Nemopunk15.
[25:27.770 --> 25:29.990]  We're at 233 episodes.
[25:29.990 --> 25:32.830]  I hope I have given myself some leeway
[25:32.830 --> 25:33.970]  to get high and chill out
[25:33.970 --> 25:35.850]  with one of my best friends on a show.
[25:35.850 --> 25:38.890]  Let me recommend episode 36 and 67.
[25:38.890 --> 25:40.250]  I just picked two numbers at random,
[25:40.250 --> 25:42.010]  but I'm pretty sure at least one of those two
[25:42.010 --> 25:42.850]  is gonna happen.
[25:42.850 --> 25:43.670]  Holy shit.
[25:43.670 --> 25:45.010]  Killer grow info.
[25:45.010 --> 25:46.690]  I like your approach there.
[25:46.690 --> 25:48.930]  That's a good little segue in time for a plug.
[25:49.650 --> 25:51.290]  Old episodes are now available on YouTube,
[25:51.290 --> 25:52.110]  ladies and gentlemen.
[25:52.110 --> 25:53.170]  If you go to YouTube and search
[25:53.170 --> 25:55.010]  for the Grow From Your Heart podcast,
[25:56.210 --> 25:58.650]  I think approximately 75 episodes
[25:58.650 --> 26:00.490]  are up on YouTube right now.
[26:00.490 --> 26:01.490]  There's a weekend coming up.
[26:01.490 --> 26:02.690]  I've got to work over the weekend.
[26:02.690 --> 26:03.630]  I got a lot to do.
[26:03.630 --> 26:06.670]  I may launch a couple more videos pretty soon,
[26:06.670 --> 26:07.850]  but by the time you hear this,
[26:07.850 --> 26:10.930]  I guarantee there are 75 videos up on YouTube.
[26:10.930 --> 26:12.810]  So if you're not, I just,
[26:12.810 --> 26:13.850]  did that fly fly into my mouth?
[26:13.850 --> 26:15.810]  Because I feel like it did.
[26:15.810 --> 26:16.650]  I just ate a little net.
[26:16.650 --> 26:17.930]  Do you feel like a carnivore, bro?
[26:17.930 --> 26:19.850]  No, it was weird.
[26:19.850 --> 26:21.490]  They put a little dry spot on my face.
[26:21.490 --> 26:22.530]  I saw it and then I was like,
[26:22.530 --> 26:26.010]  I went to go waft it away and I was like,
[26:26.010 --> 26:26.850]  where'd it go?
[26:27.850 --> 26:29.890]  I just ate a little skeeter net or something,
[26:29.890 --> 26:31.090]  ladies and gentlemen, on the show.
[26:31.090 --> 26:32.450]  Not gonna edit this at all.
[26:33.770 --> 26:34.830]  That just happened.
[26:36.630 --> 26:37.470]  Yep.
[26:37.470 --> 26:38.850]  I'm glad these mic covers are clean, bro.
[26:38.850 --> 26:40.330]  Give me a hint what I was saying.
[26:40.330 --> 26:41.810]  YouTube.
[26:41.810 --> 26:45.450]  Yeah, by all means, go check out the YouTube channel.
[26:45.450 --> 26:46.770]  I just ate a fucking bug.
[26:48.370 --> 26:49.210]  All right, let's move forward.
[26:49.210 --> 26:50.030]  That's a showstopper.
[26:50.030 --> 26:51.250]  I'm gonna let you chew on that bug.
[26:51.250 --> 26:52.290]  Do you wanna hand me that torch?
[26:52.290 --> 26:54.090]  Yeah, here, I'll heat this big jug for you.
[26:54.090 --> 26:57.370]  I will heat up this thermal banger for you,
[26:57.370 --> 26:58.210]  the bubble cap.
[26:58.210 --> 27:01.090]  I gotta tell you, I was kind of skeptical
[27:01.090 --> 27:02.750]  about the thermal banger.
[27:02.750 --> 27:04.930]  The first good dab I got off of it,
[27:04.930 --> 27:08.650]  it wasn't even my own dab.
[27:08.650 --> 27:10.690]  Jeff took one of Jeff's dabs,
[27:10.690 --> 27:12.350]  his eyes started to roll back into his head
[27:12.350 --> 27:15.210]  about the sixth rip he took out of the bucket,
[27:15.210 --> 27:16.690]  and he just kind of looked at me,
[27:16.690 --> 27:18.630]  shrugged, and handed me the rig.
[27:19.590 --> 27:21.170]  I took two good rips out of it.
[27:21.170 --> 27:22.650]  He hit it with the torch again,
[27:22.650 --> 27:25.250]  and then handed it back, and I got like six more.
[27:25.250 --> 27:27.490]  Sometimes I put a little more hash in there
[27:27.490 --> 27:28.850]  than I probably should have.
[27:30.970 --> 27:35.850]  This bucket with this cap hits like several trucks.
[27:35.850 --> 27:37.010]  And part of it is that rig.
[27:37.010 --> 27:39.170]  I know people, so there's controversy
[27:39.170 --> 27:40.850]  in the fucking cannabis industry
[27:40.850 --> 27:41.850]  and in the cannabis scene.
[27:41.850 --> 27:44.690]  People are lovers or haters of the Hitman Glass.
[27:44.690 --> 27:46.970]  I try to stay out of all of that politics,
[27:46.970 --> 27:49.610]  and I appreciate that that glass rig functions
[27:49.610 --> 27:52.430]  and hits like a god damn Mack truck
[27:52.430 --> 27:54.690]  going down the highway that didn't even see you.
[27:54.690 --> 27:55.970]  And it just thumped.
[27:55.970 --> 27:57.130]  That's one of my favorite rigs.
[27:57.130 --> 27:58.010]  It's my go-to rig.
[27:58.010 --> 27:59.650]  If I had to grab a rig to take a dab out of,
[27:59.650 --> 28:01.510]  that'd be the first one I'd go for.
[28:01.510 --> 28:05.230]  It's a Hitman Hammerhead sidecar.
[28:05.230 --> 28:09.570]  And Mike is just choking.
[28:09.570 --> 28:11.490]  And it's got a little more heat.
[28:11.490 --> 28:12.330]  I'll reheat you.
[28:13.170 --> 28:14.010]  It's gonna heat up the cap too.
[28:14.010 --> 28:15.130]  I went in a little cold,
[28:15.130 --> 28:18.610]  which is why I am able to speak to you right now.
[28:18.610 --> 28:20.130]  And I'm asking for more fire.
[28:21.570 --> 28:22.410]  That should do it.
[28:22.410 --> 28:23.250]  That should do it.
[28:23.250 --> 28:25.290]  Cheers, y'all.
[28:25.290 --> 28:26.130]  Yeah.
[28:28.490 --> 28:30.250]  Spin the cap a little.
[28:30.250 --> 28:31.370]  You spin the cap a little.
[28:31.370 --> 28:32.930]  Well, that would be awkward.
[28:34.010 --> 28:35.330]  There you go, I got you a dab.
[28:35.330 --> 28:37.010]  That shit's probably hotter than shit.
[28:37.010 --> 28:38.610]  It was beautiful.
[28:38.610 --> 28:40.610]  There you go.
[28:40.810 --> 28:42.930]  I'm gonna kind of turn Mike's mic,
[28:42.930 --> 28:44.570]  un-Mike Mike for Mike's minute.
[28:45.930 --> 28:47.570]  All right, go check out YouTube.
[28:48.730 --> 28:50.370]  Mike's turning colors over there.
[28:51.290 --> 28:53.130]  He's worn a Grow From Your Heart hoodie.
[28:53.130 --> 28:55.590]  And now he matches the red in the word grow.
[28:56.610 --> 28:58.090]  Yeah.
[28:58.090 --> 28:59.050]  He's giving me devil horns.
[28:59.050 --> 28:59.890]  He is gonna live.
[28:59.890 --> 29:01.050]  He's all right.
[29:01.050 --> 29:02.330]  All right.
[29:02.330 --> 29:03.170]  Mike, do you remember what the hell
[29:03.170 --> 29:04.970]  we were talking about just a second ago?
[29:06.890 --> 29:08.970]  Episode 36 and 67.
[29:08.970 --> 29:10.690]  YouTube, I think we got past that.
[29:10.690 --> 29:12.410]  I think we got past telling everybody to look at YouTube.
[29:12.410 --> 29:13.650]  And then we're gonna take some dabs.
[29:13.650 --> 29:15.970]  We talked about the thermal banger changing my life.
[29:15.970 --> 29:16.810]  A lot.
[29:16.810 --> 29:17.650]  We talked about the thermal banger.
[29:17.650 --> 29:18.890]  I was talking about the Hitman rig.
[29:18.890 --> 29:19.730]  All right.
[29:19.730 --> 29:20.570]  Oh yeah, the Hitman rig.
[29:20.570 --> 29:21.770]  I don't know about the controversy.
[29:21.770 --> 29:22.610]  I don't follow that shit.
[29:22.610 --> 29:23.770]  I'm fucking busy.
[29:23.770 --> 29:27.370]  But this particular, what is it, the Hammerhead sidecar?
[29:27.370 --> 29:30.090]  Yeah, see on the bottom it's got the stem comes down
[29:30.090 --> 29:30.930]  and it goes out two directions.
[29:30.930 --> 29:31.930]  And I see that you cleaned it today.
[29:31.930 --> 29:32.770]  I just dumped it out.
[29:32.770 --> 29:34.130]  Yeah, I just dumped it out so we didn't have to smoke
[29:34.130 --> 29:35.210]  through the clogged up shit.
[29:35.210 --> 29:37.410]  Yeah, when you get a golf ball or reclaim built
[29:37.410 --> 29:38.450]  in the bottom of this thing,
[29:38.450 --> 29:41.810]  it tends to hit a little slow to warm it up.
[29:41.810 --> 29:44.130]  But the function on it's beautiful.
[29:44.130 --> 29:48.850]  It's small, it's fist sized, it's sturdy and stable.
[29:48.850 --> 29:51.810]  I like a small dab rig because a bong,
[29:51.810 --> 29:54.490]  the idea with the bong is to fill it up with weed smoke.
[29:54.490 --> 29:56.250]  You're smoking, you're lighting it, you're pulling it.
[29:56.250 --> 29:58.650]  You got smoke filling up in that big ass tube.
[29:58.650 --> 30:00.610]  And then when it's time, you pull the carb
[30:00.610 --> 30:02.210]  or you pull the bowl out is what you do with the net
[30:02.210 --> 30:04.810]  with a futuristic bong, with the bong of today.
[30:04.850 --> 30:08.490]  You pull the slide and the smoke goes into your lungs
[30:08.490 --> 30:11.770]  and you just get high, straight to the brain.
[30:11.770 --> 30:12.850]  But when you're smoking a dab,
[30:12.850 --> 30:15.110]  there's no need to fill a giant chamber.
[30:15.110 --> 30:17.090]  I don't want to smoke a liter of oxygen,
[30:17.090 --> 30:19.890]  no liter of cola before I start getting myself a dab.
[30:19.890 --> 30:22.210]  This little rig, it goes through the banger,
[30:22.210 --> 30:23.690]  down that little stem, into the water
[30:23.690 --> 30:26.570]  and then kapow, right in the kiss up.
[30:27.690 --> 30:29.050]  You don't need a ton of water.
[30:29.050 --> 30:32.170]  You don't need a ton of room in the glass
[30:32.170 --> 30:33.970]  for the vapor coming off the bucket.
[30:35.210 --> 30:37.530]  A nice small rig.
[30:37.530 --> 30:38.810]  My trip is stable.
[30:38.810 --> 30:41.250]  My first two rigs were real unstable
[30:41.250 --> 30:44.250]  and no matter what you put on them were top heavy.
[30:44.250 --> 30:47.650]  And that leads to panically trying to grab a rig
[30:47.650 --> 30:48.930]  as it's tipping or falling.
[30:48.930 --> 30:50.210]  And then the panic grab.
[30:50.210 --> 30:52.890]  And then you end up with a nice brand on your hand
[30:52.890 --> 30:55.010]  from where you grab the hot leg.
[30:55.010 --> 30:56.330]  There's just no need for that.
[30:56.330 --> 30:59.410]  And when it's nice and stable like this, it's just so nice.
[30:59.410 --> 31:00.930]  I got two Hitman rigs on the table.
[31:00.930 --> 31:02.170]  They're both nice and stable.
[31:02.170 --> 31:03.970]  And I love the flared out mouthpiece.
[31:04.010 --> 31:06.050]  Yeah, okay, Hitman, that's a good advertisement.
[31:06.050 --> 31:07.370]  Sorry.
[31:07.370 --> 31:08.690]  I don't know about no controversy.
[31:08.690 --> 31:09.810]  I just likes what I likes.
[31:09.810 --> 31:12.330]  Yeah, so well, there's a lot of stupid controversy
[31:12.330 --> 31:13.250]  in the cannabis industry.
[31:13.250 --> 31:15.370]  And I don't even, the Hitman controversy doesn't bother me.
[31:15.370 --> 31:16.210]  It's like, what that is.
[31:16.210 --> 31:18.250]  Why are you guys picking shit on dumb shit?
[31:18.250 --> 31:20.050]  You're haters because people like them.
[31:20.050 --> 31:21.930]  Worry about shit that matters.
[31:21.930 --> 31:23.490]  Yeah, that's how you know you're doing all right.
[31:23.490 --> 31:26.010]  You can just go by how many people fucking do not like you
[31:26.010 --> 31:27.930]  for no stupid reason.
[31:27.930 --> 31:29.050]  Yup.
[31:29.050 --> 31:29.890]  Yup.
[31:29.890 --> 31:30.770]  And we haven't gone for a long time.
[31:30.770 --> 31:32.050]  You want to read an email?
[31:32.050 --> 31:32.890]  We should.
[31:32.890 --> 31:34.410]  I'll read one email.
[31:34.410 --> 31:35.250]  I've got it sitting right here.
[31:35.250 --> 31:37.570]  It's from a guy from Canada.
[31:37.570 --> 31:40.930]  I see bullet points, props to the dude from Canada.
[31:41.970 --> 31:43.210]  I'm not sure.
[31:43.210 --> 31:45.730]  I'm trying to skim and see if we're supposed to say his name
[31:45.730 --> 31:46.690]  or anything.
[31:46.690 --> 31:49.130]  Always a good idea to put that at the top list.
[31:49.130 --> 31:49.970]  Yeah, well, I'm not going to say his name.
[31:49.970 --> 31:51.930]  I heard on the last email episode,
[31:51.930 --> 31:53.210]  that's how somebody started it off.
[31:53.210 --> 31:54.570]  And I was like, that's beautiful.
[31:54.570 --> 31:55.770]  Thank you for listening.
[31:56.810 --> 31:58.930]  Well, this guy starts and if he gets to his name,
[31:58.930 --> 32:00.330]  I'll just try to remember to skip it.
[32:00.330 --> 32:02.450]  And if not, we'll use the wonderful magic of editing.
[32:03.010 --> 32:05.170]  What's something super Canadian?
[32:05.170 --> 32:06.570]  Dude's name that's super Canadian?
[32:06.570 --> 32:07.970]  Should we just call him Gretzky?
[32:07.970 --> 32:09.370]  Well, let's see if he signed it.
[32:09.370 --> 32:11.250]  We'll just go to the end.
[32:11.250 --> 32:12.090]  But dude.
[32:12.090 --> 32:13.730]  I was trying not to go with somebody's name.
[32:13.730 --> 32:14.850]  Let's call him Canuck.
[32:14.850 --> 32:15.690]  How about that?
[32:15.690 --> 32:16.530]  Canuck.
[32:16.530 --> 32:17.370]  Canuck.
[32:17.370 --> 32:18.210]  Yup.
[32:18.210 --> 32:19.050]  All right, what's up Canuck?
[32:19.050 --> 32:19.890]  What do you got to say?
[32:19.890 --> 32:23.290]  Dear Rasta Jeff, I'm writing from Canada near Toronto.
[32:23.290 --> 32:25.330]  About two months ago, we set up a two by two
[32:25.330 --> 32:27.370]  hydroponic grow cabinet under an LED.
[32:27.370 --> 32:28.450]  So far, so good.
[32:28.450 --> 32:29.290]  Okay.
[32:29.290 --> 32:30.290]  The setup is not ideal,
[32:30.290 --> 32:32.170]  but even with legal recreational cannabis
[32:32.850 --> 32:35.090]  coming to Canada by July 2018,
[32:35.090 --> 32:36.770]  there is a social stigma associated
[32:36.770 --> 32:38.850]  with the recreational pot use here
[32:38.850 --> 32:41.250]  that would make it important for us to remain discreet
[32:41.250 --> 32:43.250]  and secure and stealth with our grow
[32:43.250 --> 32:46.930]  for this foreseeable future, even after legalization.
[32:46.930 --> 32:47.770]  Yup.
[32:47.770 --> 32:49.090]  So yeah, there's people around.
[32:49.090 --> 32:52.010]  You just can't let know, which is understandable.
[32:52.010 --> 32:52.850]  Nope.
[32:52.850 --> 32:53.690]  Well said, man.
[32:53.690 --> 32:55.410]  Just because it's legal and the cops ain't looking no more,
[32:55.410 --> 32:57.050]  doesn't mean the Rippers aren't.
[32:57.050 --> 32:58.050]  Well, maybe he's got family.
[32:58.050 --> 32:59.050]  Maybe he's got a job.
[32:59.050 --> 32:59.890]  Yeah.
[32:59.890 --> 33:00.730]  We don't know who this guy is or what he's doing.
[33:00.730 --> 33:01.650]  The judge by the lady up the street, yeah.
[33:02.210 --> 33:04.690]  Maybe he runs a business and he'll lose his clientele
[33:04.690 --> 33:05.530]  if they know, whatever.
[33:05.530 --> 33:08.690]  Plenty of other people around to hate, even if it's legal.
[33:08.690 --> 33:10.650]  We can't all be Rasta Jeff.
[33:10.650 --> 33:11.890]  Nope.
[33:11.890 --> 33:12.730]  I'm blessed.
[33:12.730 --> 33:13.610]  I appreciate it.
[33:13.610 --> 33:15.010]  So he goes on and he says,
[33:15.010 --> 33:17.130]  I know you don't want to encourage illegal activity,
[33:17.130 --> 33:19.090]  but if you did some podcasts on subjects
[33:19.090 --> 33:22.450]  for stealth indoor grows, it would help people like me
[33:22.450 --> 33:24.490]  that will be growing legally next year,
[33:24.490 --> 33:26.570]  but have to keep quiet about it.
[33:26.570 --> 33:28.850]  Like, excuse me, like every new grower,
[33:28.850 --> 33:30.650]  my wife and I have read everything we can,
[33:30.650 --> 33:32.010]  we can get our hands on to help.
[33:32.010 --> 33:34.970]  We visit Hydro stores and we've asked a lot of questions.
[33:34.970 --> 33:36.130]  We're already on the right path, man.
[33:36.130 --> 33:36.970]  You're smart.
[33:36.970 --> 33:39.330]  You're listening to a good podcast and you're reading.
[33:39.330 --> 33:41.170]  That's a lot of people skip that part.
[33:41.170 --> 33:43.930]  They just go to growing and then they buy the books later.
[33:43.930 --> 33:46.610]  Setting yourself up for success.
[33:46.610 --> 33:47.530]  Then he goes on, he says,
[33:47.530 --> 33:50.250]  learning from your experience on the podcast
[33:50.250 --> 33:52.450]  has made it so much easier to sort through the bullshit
[33:52.450 --> 33:53.370]  that is out there.
[33:53.370 --> 33:54.570]  Oh, that's why I do it.
[33:54.570 --> 33:55.410]  So I'm glad.
[33:55.410 --> 33:57.530]  I think I've said before that part of why I did it
[33:57.530 --> 33:59.250]  is because the internet is full of shit
[33:59.250 --> 34:01.610]  and it sucks that people are getting misled by the internet.
[34:01.610 --> 34:03.970]  The ruining grows because some guy said to pour
[34:03.970 --> 34:07.250]  coffee grounds and fucking Dr. Pepper into your plant
[34:07.250 --> 34:09.250]  and it would make it grow more colas.
[34:09.250 --> 34:11.170]  And they tried it and now they just got ants
[34:11.170 --> 34:12.190]  and a dead plant.
[34:12.190 --> 34:17.190]  And I've seen way meaner shit posted
[34:17.610 --> 34:19.890]  as like polite suggestions too.
[34:19.890 --> 34:21.170]  So the email keeps going.
[34:21.170 --> 34:22.570]  He says, over the past three months,
[34:22.570 --> 34:24.290]  I have binge listened to all of the
[34:24.290 --> 34:25.450]  Grow From Your Heart podcasts.
[34:25.450 --> 34:28.330]  I'm looking forward to going back over them again,
[34:28.330 --> 34:30.250]  this time to take notes.
[34:30.250 --> 34:31.330]  Yeah.
[34:31.330 --> 34:32.170]  Wow.
[34:32.170 --> 34:33.370]  That's going to give me a lot of clicks in the ratings.
[34:33.370 --> 34:34.650]  I appreciate it.
[34:34.650 --> 34:35.490]  Yeah.
[34:35.490 --> 34:37.290]  With the, so you're going to have to keep traveling
[34:37.290 --> 34:40.010]  back in time somehow because there are more episodes
[34:40.010 --> 34:41.930]  coming out and stuff falls out of the stitcher feeds.
[34:41.930 --> 34:44.170]  You're going to have to start checking them out on YouTube
[34:44.170 --> 34:46.610]  because YouTube videos don't disappear over time
[34:46.610 --> 34:48.170]  no matter how many I add.
[34:48.170 --> 34:51.250]  That's, that's a cool little thing I realized there one day.
[34:51.250 --> 34:53.050]  So it'll take me a minute, but I'll get them all up there.
[34:53.050 --> 34:54.810]  I've got 85 videos made.
[34:54.810 --> 34:56.410]  There are 75 posted.
[34:56.450 --> 34:58.730]  They take a long time to make and post.
[34:58.730 --> 35:01.410]  It just ties up my computer for however long the video is.
[35:01.410 --> 35:03.170]  It takes about three times that long to post it.
[35:03.170 --> 35:05.290]  So if it's an hour, it's going to take three hours to post it.
[35:05.290 --> 35:06.770]  When I get to these three hour videos,
[35:06.770 --> 35:08.930]  I don't know if YouTube's going to explode
[35:08.930 --> 35:09.970]  or what might happen.
[35:09.970 --> 35:11.130]  Yep.
[35:11.130 --> 35:11.970]  We will see.
[35:13.250 --> 35:14.250]  So a lot of great stuff in here.
[35:14.250 --> 35:17.050]  There's more to this email, but before we go too far,
[35:17.050 --> 35:19.610]  I want to back up and talk about some of it.
[35:19.610 --> 35:22.810]  A two by two hydro grow under an LED and a cabinet.
[35:22.810 --> 35:24.730]  That's pretty stealth, pretty fucking smooth.
[35:24.730 --> 35:25.570]  Good idea.
[35:25.610 --> 35:26.450]  I like that.
[35:26.450 --> 35:29.890]  And like we talked about, very good idea to stay discreet.
[35:29.890 --> 35:31.250]  You don't have to tell anybody.
[35:31.250 --> 35:32.930]  That'll keep you much safer.
[35:32.930 --> 35:35.370]  And yes, we won't encourage illegal activity.
[35:35.370 --> 35:36.970]  Everyone's an adult and this only applies
[35:36.970 --> 35:39.690]  to people doing things in legal places.
[35:39.690 --> 35:41.170]  Big kudos on reading.
[35:41.170 --> 35:42.130]  I'm glad you're doing that.
[35:42.130 --> 35:44.530]  And thanks for the compliments on the podcast.
[35:44.530 --> 35:45.890]  I appreciate that.
[35:45.890 --> 35:48.330]  And let's see, it's time to take notes.
[35:48.330 --> 35:51.090]  Now, he says we've made some classic mistakes.
[35:51.090 --> 35:52.770]  And this guy is, maybe it's a gal.
[35:52.770 --> 35:53.610]  No, you said my wife.
[35:53.610 --> 35:54.770]  Well, it still could be a gal.
[35:54.890 --> 35:55.730]  It's the damn future.
[35:55.730 --> 35:56.970]  Everything is so confusing.
[35:56.970 --> 35:59.010]  This non-binary listener,
[36:01.570 --> 36:02.890]  so weird in the future now.
[36:02.890 --> 36:05.090]  Yes, our listener friend, Canuck says,
[36:05.090 --> 36:07.290]  we've made some classic mistakes and I'm proud of them
[36:07.290 --> 36:09.370]  for just admitting their mistakes right off the bat.
[36:09.370 --> 36:10.690]  That's a cool way to open up.
[36:10.690 --> 36:12.530]  That gives you integrity right away.
[36:12.530 --> 36:14.330]  Sour diesel was probably not a good choice
[36:14.330 --> 36:15.690]  for a cabinet grow.
[36:15.690 --> 36:17.250]  And like he giggled right away
[36:17.250 --> 36:19.650]  because he just envisioned coal is like three feet tall
[36:19.650 --> 36:20.490]  and a two foot grow.
[36:20.490 --> 36:22.730]  And he's like, yep, sour diesel got out of hand.
[36:22.770 --> 36:23.610]  Three weeks into flower,
[36:23.610 --> 36:25.530]  she's trying to lift that light up for you.
[36:25.530 --> 36:27.210]  Yeah, and you're just going, oh shit,
[36:27.210 --> 36:28.970]  what are we gonna do now?
[36:28.970 --> 36:30.970]  Get the saw, honey, we gotta raise the roof.
[36:30.970 --> 36:32.890]  And they continue with, we didn't know what we didn't know,
[36:32.890 --> 36:34.970]  but we've learned firsthand about relentless,
[36:34.970 --> 36:36.650]  scrogging, super cropping, trimming,
[36:36.650 --> 36:39.130]  and topping to keep them shorter than the lights.
[36:39.130 --> 36:40.650]  Well, that's one way to learn.
[36:40.650 --> 36:42.250]  And you won't make that mistake again.
[36:42.250 --> 36:44.010]  And now you know what to do.
[36:44.010 --> 36:45.850]  Some bending and popping isn't as bad
[36:45.850 --> 36:47.130]  as it looks like it is sometimes.
[36:47.130 --> 36:49.890]  There are plants that are three or four weeks into flower
[36:49.890 --> 36:51.930]  and I will walk by them and give them a little twist
[36:51.930 --> 36:54.170]  and just give them a little pop on the main cola.
[36:54.170 --> 36:55.970]  And they'll bend over for two or three days,
[36:55.970 --> 36:57.170]  but then they'll grow right back up
[36:57.170 --> 36:58.770]  and they'll be even stronger than they were.
[36:58.770 --> 37:00.250]  And now the canopy is a little more even.
[37:00.250 --> 37:01.570]  They're not getting up away from the light.
[37:01.570 --> 37:02.930]  It just, it helps them out.
[37:02.930 --> 37:04.130]  I think it's good for them.
[37:04.130 --> 37:06.570]  So this dude tried to grow sour diesel in a small space
[37:06.570 --> 37:08.610]  and learned a lot because he was forced to.
[37:08.610 --> 37:10.410]  That's a good way to learn.
[37:10.410 --> 37:11.810]  Oh shit, what's going on?
[37:11.810 --> 37:14.370]  Find the book and check is a great way to learn.
[37:14.370 --> 37:16.930]  Yeah, this guy sounds like a smart person.
[37:16.930 --> 37:19.170]  I'm sure he was like, watch this, we'll bend it.
[37:19.170 --> 37:20.010]  He goes on and says,
[37:20.010 --> 37:21.370]  we started off with RO water
[37:21.370 --> 37:22.890]  and learned about nutrient deficiency.
[37:22.890 --> 37:24.770]  The girls are all better now.
[37:24.770 --> 37:26.090]  Yes, when you're using RO water,
[37:26.090 --> 37:29.090]  you're gonna get more deficiencies
[37:29.090 --> 37:31.370]  because the RO water is cleaning everything out.
[37:31.370 --> 37:33.170]  You're gonna have to add everything yourself.
[37:33.170 --> 37:35.970]  The municipal water is a little more balanced.
[37:35.970 --> 37:37.730]  I'd already, it's got more pieces there.
[37:37.730 --> 37:39.090]  Yeah, there's, well, there's already calcium
[37:39.090 --> 37:40.290]  and magnesium in there.
[37:41.690 --> 37:42.730]  Yeah, when you start off with RO,
[37:42.730 --> 37:44.850]  you have to add everything yourself.
[37:44.850 --> 37:46.770]  It's just all at zero.
[37:46.770 --> 37:47.610]  Then he goes on and says,
[37:47.610 --> 37:49.930]  we started condensing and pulling on the concrete
[37:50.730 --> 37:52.210]  floor, the room where we kept the cabinet
[37:52.210 --> 37:54.890]  is now power vented to the outside.
[37:56.090 --> 37:58.610]  We did not anticipate the humidity.
[37:58.610 --> 38:01.490]  Oh yeah, people don't realize that every drop of water
[38:01.490 --> 38:02.810]  you pour into that plant of water
[38:02.810 --> 38:04.690]  is going to come back out of the leaves
[38:04.690 --> 38:05.890]  and it's gonna stay in that place
[38:05.890 --> 38:07.570]  if you don't have some way to get rid of it.
[38:07.570 --> 38:09.090]  When I talk about building grows,
[38:09.090 --> 38:12.010]  I talk so much about air exchange and air flow,
[38:12.010 --> 38:13.810]  air flow, air flow, fresh air in,
[38:13.810 --> 38:15.730]  all there out, do it a lot.
[38:15.730 --> 38:18.090]  It's something people don't think about
[38:19.090 --> 38:22.290]  as important, they think light and food.
[38:22.290 --> 38:23.370]  They don't think about air.
[38:23.370 --> 38:25.090]  And an air conditioner, they wanna cool it
[38:25.090 --> 38:26.570]  and they don't wanna bring any fresh air in
[38:26.570 --> 38:28.450]  or put any CO2 in there or get that old,
[38:28.450 --> 38:29.770]  stale, funky air out.
[38:29.770 --> 38:31.170]  Yep.
[38:31.170 --> 38:34.090]  And there's, I mean, the humidity's a major issue.
[38:34.090 --> 38:38.810]  When you read about black market grows being destructive,
[38:38.810 --> 38:41.570]  the two points that the police always bitch about
[38:41.570 --> 38:42.890]  are mold and wiring.
[38:42.890 --> 38:45.250]  Yeah, they don't wanna fire and then you've destroyed
[38:45.250 --> 38:46.570]  the house by making it moldy.
[38:46.570 --> 38:49.450]  And even when people step up and hire a good electrician
[38:49.450 --> 38:51.530]  to come in and wire the house properly
[38:51.530 --> 38:53.730]  or get proper wiring to the grow,
[38:53.730 --> 38:57.530]  they often skimp on air in and out
[38:57.530 --> 39:00.810]  because it's an easy way to tip off the neighbors
[39:00.810 --> 39:02.690]  that you're growing is when you vent out the window
[39:02.690 --> 39:03.770]  or something.
[39:03.770 --> 39:05.930]  Why is that vent there becomes a question.
[39:05.930 --> 39:08.210]  Why does it smell so dank over there?
[39:08.210 --> 39:10.130]  Why isn't there any snow for about four feet
[39:10.130 --> 39:11.810]  right here by this window, by the basement?
[39:11.810 --> 39:13.730]  A beautiful picture, I think, that was taken
[39:13.730 --> 39:16.410]  in Holland, it's just house after house
[39:17.090 --> 39:19.650]  and they're all covered with snow except for one of them.
[39:19.650 --> 39:21.850]  It's a perfectly dry roof and it's like,
[39:21.850 --> 39:24.330]  meh, what's going on over there?
[39:24.330 --> 39:27.570]  Yeah, maybe someone's got some grow lights in the attic.
[39:27.570 --> 39:30.650]  Yep, or do you remember the house we used to drive by
[39:30.650 --> 39:32.850]  all the time where it was just metal halide blue
[39:32.850 --> 39:35.490]  for days out of that one garage window?
[39:35.490 --> 39:38.210]  Yeah, yeah, it was too obvious.
[39:38.210 --> 39:40.050]  Sometimes you guys gotta be a little more careful.
[39:40.050 --> 39:41.530]  All right, let's keep going with the email.
[39:41.530 --> 39:44.330]  Yes, I'm glad you realized it's gonna get too humid
[39:44.410 --> 39:46.730]  in there, I hope you did not get powdery mildew.
[39:46.730 --> 39:47.810]  The email keeps going, it says,
[39:47.810 --> 39:49.650]  the plan is forgiving and we're having a blast
[39:49.650 --> 39:51.130]  watching the flowers develop.
[39:51.130 --> 39:54.250]  We're already making plans for the second grow.
[39:54.250 --> 39:55.770]  We're having so much fun and can't wait
[39:55.770 --> 39:57.530]  to use our homegrown medicine.
[39:57.530 --> 40:00.490]  A small hydro cabinet under LED is about as far
[40:00.490 --> 40:03.770]  as we can get from how your, hold on,
[40:03.770 --> 40:05.810]  let me correct myself here, I may have to edit.
[40:05.810 --> 40:08.130]  A small hydro cabinet grow under LED is about
[40:08.130 --> 40:10.610]  as far as we can get from how you grow,
[40:10.610 --> 40:12.210]  but your help has been invaluable
[40:12.210 --> 40:14.210]  beyond what you can imagine.
[40:15.050 --> 40:15.890]  Thank you.
[40:15.890 --> 40:18.170]  Man, everything is applicable in a certain way
[40:18.170 --> 40:20.010]  and it sounds like you're super smart enough to.
[40:20.010 --> 40:22.890]  I was gonna say it's not that different than how you.
[40:22.890 --> 40:24.650]  It's just hydro and LED.
[40:24.650 --> 40:26.010]  I mean, you've got plants under lights
[40:26.010 --> 40:27.730]  and you're feeding them nutrients and taking care of them.
[40:27.730 --> 40:29.290]  You had to scrug them and take care of them.
[40:29.290 --> 40:30.370]  You had to trim them.
[40:30.370 --> 40:31.730]  Hopefully you did some defoliating.
[40:31.730 --> 40:35.530]  So yeah, man, just because it's small
[40:35.530 --> 40:36.930]  and you don't have a bunch of stuff
[40:36.930 --> 40:38.090]  doesn't mean you don't have the heart
[40:38.090 --> 40:39.930]  and that you're doing it as hard as I am.
[40:39.930 --> 40:40.970]  You're going as hard as me, man,
[40:40.970 --> 40:43.490]  because honestly, I'm gonna put my paper down
[40:43.530 --> 40:44.890]  and I'm gonna talk about some real shit.
[40:44.890 --> 40:46.610]  You're doing it where it's not legal.
[40:46.610 --> 40:48.050]  You're going way harder than me.
[40:48.050 --> 40:49.330]  I get to play easy.
[40:49.330 --> 40:51.530]  I get to drive to a place with a hundred lights.
[40:51.530 --> 40:53.410]  It's got fucking security cameras that everyone,
[40:53.410 --> 40:55.610]  like we talked about 18 organizations have come in
[40:55.610 --> 40:57.570]  and said, you can do this.
[40:57.570 --> 41:00.690]  You've got all 18 of those organizations are up your ass
[41:00.690 --> 41:02.410]  plus your neighbors, plus the thieves,
[41:02.410 --> 41:04.490]  plus whoever you're trying to be discreet from,
[41:04.490 --> 41:06.570]  plus those people also.
[41:06.570 --> 41:07.890]  So man, props to you.
[41:07.890 --> 41:09.850]  You're doing it harder than me.
[41:09.970 --> 41:13.530]  That one LED is way more balls
[41:13.530 --> 41:16.490]  than whatever hundreds of lights I've ever ran.
[41:16.490 --> 41:17.490]  Like I got respect for that.
[41:17.490 --> 41:18.810]  So don't ever think that you're not doing it
[41:18.810 --> 41:20.090]  just as hard as us,
[41:20.090 --> 41:22.090]  because we're pussies here doing it legally.
[41:22.090 --> 41:23.010]  That's one thing I laugh at
[41:23.010 --> 41:25.010]  is when people talk about how good they grow
[41:25.010 --> 41:26.130]  or how well they grow.
[41:26.130 --> 41:27.770]  We had this conversation earlier.
[41:29.090 --> 41:30.810]  When people try to show off their weed
[41:30.810 --> 41:31.650]  and I'm like, how long have you been at this?
[41:31.650 --> 41:33.010]  And they're like, oh, right when it got legal,
[41:33.010 --> 41:33.850]  I got my card.
[41:33.850 --> 41:36.170]  And I was like, people have been doing it like,
[41:36.170 --> 41:39.090]  we were able to pull that off in basements
[41:39.210 --> 41:40.650]  where we only rented the house long enough
[41:40.650 --> 41:42.730]  to just blow it up and get a crop out
[41:42.730 --> 41:43.930]  and then have to tear it down and leave
[41:43.930 --> 41:45.330]  because it got suspicious.
[41:45.330 --> 41:47.050]  And we were pulling out cup winning crops
[41:47.050 --> 41:48.530]  and amazing crops and shit.
[41:48.530 --> 41:49.930]  Now it's funny now that people are like,
[41:49.930 --> 41:50.770]  yeah, I've got-
[41:50.770 --> 41:51.610]  Box grows.
[41:51.610 --> 41:53.970]  Yeah, I've just got my non-discreet,
[41:53.970 --> 41:55.570]  just wide open grow in my house
[41:55.570 --> 41:57.090]  that you can hear down the block just going,
[41:57.090 --> 41:59.570]  whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[41:59.570 --> 42:01.850]  Yeah, I'm like, all right, good weed, bro.
[42:01.850 --> 42:04.450]  But man, it's so easy now.
[42:04.450 --> 42:06.810]  So this dude, we give you props
[42:06.810 --> 42:09.010]  for having the balls to do so.
[42:09.810 --> 42:11.570]  In a place that's not as safe as our location.
[42:11.570 --> 42:13.850]  Yeah, Canada's on their way.
[42:13.850 --> 42:15.890]  I haven't really looked at the,
[42:15.890 --> 42:17.010]  cause they're not final yet.
[42:17.010 --> 42:21.450]  They're not even really down to proposals to pick.
[42:21.450 --> 42:23.290]  Their new-
[42:23.290 --> 42:24.130]  Prime minister?
[42:24.130 --> 42:27.090]  Yeah, prime minister, Justin Trudeau.
[42:27.090 --> 42:27.930]  Yes.
[42:27.930 --> 42:29.050]  I can see him, but yeah,
[42:29.050 --> 42:31.690]  it took me a minute to pull his name out of my brain.
[42:32.850 --> 42:34.930]  Did run on essentially not,
[42:34.930 --> 42:37.290]  this wasn't his main platform talking point,
[42:37.330 --> 42:39.690]  but on a legalization platform
[42:39.690 --> 42:43.930]  and has pledged to legalize cannabis by some date in 2018.
[42:43.930 --> 42:46.130]  But what that looks like,
[42:46.130 --> 42:48.290]  what the final rules are gonna be,
[42:48.290 --> 42:51.650]  none of that's really been finalized yet.
[42:51.650 --> 42:53.690]  Like including the minimum age to buy,
[42:53.690 --> 42:54.810]  there's a big to-do.
[42:54.810 --> 42:56.850]  The group of people that were appointed
[42:56.850 --> 42:59.410]  to kick out recommendations came back with,
[42:59.410 --> 43:01.530]  18 is the age limit.
[43:02.730 --> 43:04.570]  And so all the big prohibitionists
[43:04.570 --> 43:08.330]  that have been kind of gaining momentum
[43:08.330 --> 43:13.010]  over the last year or so since the rise of Trump
[43:14.770 --> 43:16.290]  are really freaked out because,
[43:16.290 --> 43:18.370]  oh my God, the US is bad enough
[43:18.370 --> 43:21.610]  with Colorado and Oregon, Washington and Alaska,
[43:21.610 --> 43:22.970]  allowing it 21,
[43:22.970 --> 43:24.570]  the whole country's gonna be 18
[43:24.570 --> 43:27.170]  and it's just over the border and oh my God.
[43:27.170 --> 43:29.090]  It's yeah, it's marijuana.
[43:29.090 --> 43:30.170]  It's not tobacco.
[43:30.170 --> 43:31.250]  It's not alcohol.
[43:31.250 --> 43:32.170]  It's not driving.
[43:32.170 --> 43:33.010]  It's not guns.
[43:33.050 --> 43:35.850]  It's not even fucking bungee jumping or caffeine.
[43:36.970 --> 43:38.970]  Cops are more dangerous than cannabis.
[43:38.970 --> 43:42.970]  Yep, by far.
[43:42.970 --> 43:44.650]  No one's ever been shot by cannabis.
[43:44.650 --> 43:46.650]  No marijuana plant has ever gotten scared
[43:46.650 --> 43:48.610]  and shot a teenager in the back.
[43:48.610 --> 43:51.090]  I don't know if I meant to say that on a podcast.
[43:51.090 --> 43:52.370]  Welcome to Stony Hill.
[43:52.370 --> 43:53.730]  It's perfect.
[43:53.730 --> 43:54.570]  Yep.
[43:55.610 --> 43:56.970]  It's gonna be that time of the year again.
[43:56.970 --> 43:58.290]  So speaking of shooting people,
[43:58.290 --> 44:00.010]  don't shoot people over your weed crop.
[44:00.010 --> 44:02.170]  That was a random gear shift right there.
[44:02.210 --> 44:03.770]  Don't shoot people over your weed crop.
[44:03.770 --> 44:05.010]  We're still doing this dude's email,
[44:05.010 --> 44:05.930]  so don't get too far.
[44:05.930 --> 44:07.330]  Don't get too far out of that.
[44:07.330 --> 44:10.330]  But yeah, I like your little setup.
[44:10.330 --> 44:12.290]  Little closet grows are where it's at.
[44:12.290 --> 44:13.570]  Start with a two by two.
[44:13.570 --> 44:15.970]  And he's just producing enough for himself and his wife.
[44:15.970 --> 44:18.250]  The other thing I thought when we were reading your email
[44:18.250 --> 44:20.530]  is don't be afraid to go with tiny plants.
[44:22.250 --> 44:24.050]  I don't know how much you're looking to produce
[44:24.050 --> 44:25.210]  or wanting to produce,
[44:25.210 --> 44:28.970]  but you can start the flowering phase
[44:28.970 --> 44:32.150]  pretty much any time after the clone phase.
[44:33.130 --> 44:35.510]  And produce a fully flowered finished product.
[44:35.510 --> 44:38.910]  So if you've got a sativa that would,
[44:38.910 --> 44:40.790]  like if you gave it some more time in veg,
[44:40.790 --> 44:42.190]  be a serious height problem,
[44:42.190 --> 44:44.110]  you can still flower out a tiny one.
[44:44.110 --> 44:45.270]  Tiny one, yeah.
[44:45.270 --> 44:46.750]  Or like this dude's already learned,
[44:46.750 --> 44:48.030]  he can scrog it out.
[44:48.030 --> 44:50.390]  The trick is to learn how to,
[44:50.390 --> 44:53.390]  and I've done an episode on scrogging I think recently.
[44:53.390 --> 44:55.350]  The trick is to learn how to get a screen
[44:55.350 --> 44:57.230]  and spread that small space out
[44:57.230 --> 45:00.090]  and get as much vertical space as you can get
[45:00.130 --> 45:02.570]  instead of horizontal to where every,
[45:02.570 --> 45:04.330]  you got two feet by two feet,
[45:04.330 --> 45:05.810]  maybe like every four inches,
[45:05.810 --> 45:07.170]  you got a little tiny cola.
[45:08.570 --> 45:10.650]  Maybe three, to get the three and a half inch net.
[45:10.650 --> 45:11.890]  I think that'd be pretty sweet.
[45:11.890 --> 45:13.930]  The three and a half inch net and just try to put,
[45:13.930 --> 45:15.170]  just flatten the plant out a little bit
[45:15.170 --> 45:17.610]  and try to get one little small node coming out of every one
[45:17.610 --> 45:19.890]  and that would really maximize your growth space in there.
[45:19.890 --> 45:21.810]  But I'm gonna keep moving with the email.
[45:21.810 --> 45:23.730]  Yeah, and man, going hard as us.
[45:23.730 --> 45:25.650]  I was impressed with that.
[45:25.650 --> 45:28.330]  He said, it's also been helpful to hear Mike's work
[45:28.330 --> 45:31.130]  in the local efforts for sensible legalization.
[45:31.130 --> 45:32.290]  The Canadian government.
[45:32.290 --> 45:34.250]  Yeah, that's why I wanna read this while you're here.
[45:34.250 --> 45:35.090]  When I saw that, I was like,
[45:35.090 --> 45:36.970]  hey, we're gonna do this one while Mike's here.
[45:36.970 --> 45:38.770]  I appreciate that, man, thank you.
[45:38.770 --> 45:40.250]  The Canadian government has said
[45:40.250 --> 45:42.410]  that they are going to make recreational cannabis legal,
[45:42.410 --> 45:44.090]  but they have been a little light
[45:44.090 --> 45:45.970]  on what the rules are going to be.
[45:45.970 --> 45:48.650]  As the rules develop, I hope we will be able to be guided
[45:48.650 --> 45:51.610]  by the hard work already done in Colorado.
[45:52.730 --> 45:54.330]  If you really want that to be true,
[45:54.330 --> 45:56.670]  that people like you need to get on it now.
[45:57.510 --> 46:00.190]  The conversations about what the rules in Canada
[46:00.190 --> 46:01.030]  are gonna look like.
[46:01.030 --> 46:02.270]  He might not be able to based on,
[46:02.270 --> 46:03.990]  I'm assuming he may not be able to.
[46:03.990 --> 46:05.350]  He may have to hang out in the shadows
[46:05.350 --> 46:07.150]  based on his need to be discreet.
[46:07.150 --> 46:12.150]  Canada's been kind of less dickish,
[46:12.470 --> 46:13.790]  I think would be a good way to put it.
[46:13.790 --> 46:16.790]  Canada just seems less dickish than a lot of places.
[46:16.790 --> 46:17.630]  Yeah, but-
[46:17.630 --> 46:19.430]  Canada already smoked a joint
[46:19.430 --> 46:20.750]  and chilled the fuck out apparently.
[46:20.750 --> 46:21.670]  A long time ago.
[46:21.670 --> 46:22.590]  Yeah.
[46:22.590 --> 46:23.910]  They learned that if you're nice to your neighbor,
[46:23.910 --> 46:25.150]  your neighbor's usually nice to you.
[46:25.150 --> 46:25.990]  Yeah, yeah.
[46:26.830 --> 46:31.190]  But they've allowed a considerable bit more public input.
[46:31.190 --> 46:34.750]  Plus, much like it is over here,
[46:34.750 --> 46:36.790]  they've got elected representation
[46:36.790 --> 46:39.970]  that they can send emails to, make phone calls to.
[46:40.950 --> 46:43.270]  And there's always like, have your stony friend
[46:43.270 --> 46:45.870]  who doesn't have anything to lose sign the letter for you.
[46:45.870 --> 46:46.950]  Right?
[46:46.950 --> 46:48.870]  Yeah, I always, I'll do all that shit.
[46:48.870 --> 46:50.110]  I'll put my full name on there.
[46:50.110 --> 46:50.990]  I'm in, let's do it.
[46:50.990 --> 46:52.950]  Everybody knows I'm a cannabis supporter.
[46:52.950 --> 46:53.790]  Yep.
[46:53.790 --> 46:54.630]  And I'm afraid.
[46:54.630 --> 46:58.230]  I'm not above writing a draft letter saying,
[46:58.230 --> 47:00.470]  dear Senator so-and-so,
[47:00.470 --> 47:02.830]  please vote this way on this issue.
[47:03.950 --> 47:06.030]  And then sending it around to all my friends
[47:06.030 --> 47:08.150]  and being like, it doesn't matter who your Senator is.
[47:08.150 --> 47:10.750]  Copy and paste this, go to this website,
[47:10.750 --> 47:13.710]  click on the button for your area code.
[47:13.710 --> 47:15.790]  It kicks out who your Senator is.
[47:15.790 --> 47:17.710]  Click the blue button next to their name.
[47:17.710 --> 47:19.070]  It does everything else for you.
[47:19.070 --> 47:21.550]  Copy and paste this into the box and hit send.
[47:21.550 --> 47:23.110]  It's got a little email box right next to it.
[47:23.110 --> 47:24.310]  It looks like a piece of mail.
[47:24.990 --> 47:25.830]  Click on that one.
[47:25.830 --> 47:27.990]  But the conversations in Canada
[47:27.990 --> 47:30.750]  about what the rules are gonna be,
[47:30.750 --> 47:34.270]  what legalization's gonna start out as
[47:34.270 --> 47:36.870]  or look like initially are being had now.
[47:37.790 --> 47:39.910]  The people in power right now
[47:39.910 --> 47:42.990]  are going to be making those decisions very soon.
[47:44.030 --> 47:48.710]  And encouraging them to really look at Colorado's model,
[47:48.710 --> 47:51.110]  where it's been effective,
[47:51.110 --> 47:54.430]  things we didn't plan for originally
[47:54.430 --> 47:56.110]  that we've since learned about,
[47:56.990 --> 48:00.230]  getting those implementations off the start.
[48:01.670 --> 48:03.950]  Personally, I really like our advertising rules
[48:03.950 --> 48:05.430]  here in Colorado.
[48:05.430 --> 48:06.830]  I like that I don't have to listen
[48:06.830 --> 48:09.510]  to like open ads on the radio.
[48:10.830 --> 48:13.230]  I'm sure a lot of companies would love to advertise,
[48:13.230 --> 48:16.630]  but I'm fine with advertising bans for anything
[48:16.630 --> 48:20.190]  with a certain percentage of readership under whatever age.
[48:21.390 --> 48:23.950]  I'm fine with the packaging requirements here.
[48:23.950 --> 48:24.870]  I like that everything's sold
[48:24.870 --> 48:26.790]  in well-labeled childproof packaging.
[48:28.470 --> 48:30.830]  I wish other things that I buy in the world
[48:30.830 --> 48:33.990]  that are harmful to people who don't understand them
[48:33.990 --> 48:35.990]  or shouldn't be consuming them
[48:35.990 --> 48:38.950]  were packaged like this that aren't now.
[48:38.950 --> 48:40.790]  If fucking NoDoze were sold like this,
[48:40.790 --> 48:41.910]  I think fewer kids would die
[48:41.910 --> 48:43.670]  from caffeine overdoses every year.
[48:45.990 --> 48:48.110]  There's a bunch of the rules that we've implemented here
[48:48.110 --> 48:49.390]  that make a lot of sense.
[48:49.390 --> 48:52.150]  The security requirements are the reason
[48:52.150 --> 48:55.870]  Colorado doesn't have endless dispensary robberies,
[48:55.870 --> 48:58.230]  which is already looking like it might be a problem
[48:58.230 --> 49:00.830]  in a couple of other legalization states
[49:00.830 --> 49:03.990]  where the mandated security requirements
[49:03.990 --> 49:08.110]  are both less stringent and less publicized.
[49:08.110 --> 49:09.710]  One of the great things about Colorado
[49:09.710 --> 49:11.790]  is we blew that shit up big time.
[49:11.790 --> 49:13.910]  Oh man, we're gonna make these dispensaries
[49:13.910 --> 49:16.630]  put everything on the highest video you can buy,
[49:16.630 --> 49:19.150]  the clearest picture you can buy.
[49:19.910 --> 49:22.310]  That was on every news channel for months.
[49:22.310 --> 49:25.270]  You cannot be in our grow or dispensary
[49:25.270 --> 49:27.990]  without being on camera from probably three different angles.
[49:27.990 --> 49:30.070]  I can count the blackheads on your nose
[49:30.070 --> 49:31.590]  when you're in the parking lot.
[49:31.590 --> 49:32.950]  Yes, yes.
[49:32.950 --> 49:33.950]  We can see this.
[49:33.950 --> 49:36.590]  The cameras are so good at the grow at Three Rivers
[49:36.590 --> 49:40.390]  that you can see the VIN number on my vehicle
[49:40.390 --> 49:43.990]  parked in the parking lot in the building next door
[49:43.990 --> 49:45.470]  because the parking lot was too full
[49:45.470 --> 49:46.310]  because there were trimmers there.
[49:46.310 --> 49:47.510]  So I just parked in the building next door
[49:47.550 --> 49:50.550]  and you can zoom into my VIN number on my dashboard.
[49:51.550 --> 49:53.590]  There are a lot of rules that we put in place
[49:53.590 --> 49:56.590]  that have made our move from prohibition
[49:56.590 --> 49:58.830]  into legalization a lot smoother
[49:58.830 --> 50:00.790]  than it might have been otherwise.
[50:00.790 --> 50:02.750]  And according to some research
[50:02.750 --> 50:04.230]  I was looking at a couple weeks ago,
[50:04.230 --> 50:05.790]  a lot more successful.
[50:06.750 --> 50:09.710]  They looked at how many or what percentage
[50:09.710 --> 50:12.390]  of marijuana consumers period
[50:12.390 --> 50:14.230]  are buying their weed in the legal market
[50:14.230 --> 50:16.510]  versus the illegal market or the gray market.
[50:17.950 --> 50:20.670]  And Colorado has the biggest percentage
[50:20.670 --> 50:24.510]  of consumers buying product in the legal market
[50:24.510 --> 50:27.310]  of any of the legalization states right now.
[50:27.310 --> 50:29.710]  And it's because of the model we built.
[50:29.710 --> 50:32.110]  It's the most user-friendly.
[50:32.110 --> 50:34.870]  It's the least restrictive on the user end.
[50:34.870 --> 50:37.470]  And so it's the most popular and the most successful.
[50:37.470 --> 50:38.950]  So you talked about things we did add.
[50:38.950 --> 50:40.430]  What did we skip?
[50:40.430 --> 50:42.990]  And the first thing we have to say is consumption places.
[50:42.990 --> 50:46.270]  There's nowhere in our rules in Colorado,
[50:46.270 --> 50:47.790]  there's nowhere that we are actually allowed
[50:47.790 --> 50:50.950]  to safely, legally congregate and consume cannabis
[50:50.950 --> 50:51.790]  as adults.
[50:52.710 --> 50:56.950]  The Netherlands solved this 35 years ago with cafes.
[50:56.950 --> 50:58.990]  In most places in America,
[50:58.990 --> 51:00.030]  I shouldn't even go on this rant.
[51:00.030 --> 51:01.710]  You can go to just about any corner
[51:01.710 --> 51:03.470]  and there is a bar and you can congregate
[51:03.470 --> 51:05.350]  with your adult friends and you can drink alcohol
[51:05.350 --> 51:07.230]  until you throw up on yourself.
[51:07.230 --> 51:08.470]  Most places in America,
[51:08.470 --> 51:10.150]  it doesn't matter what your thing is.
[51:10.150 --> 51:13.550]  You can congregate somewhere with other people
[51:13.550 --> 51:14.950]  who are really into whatever it is,
[51:14.950 --> 51:19.950]  whether it's beanie babies or guns or cars or drag racing.
[51:20.950 --> 51:22.830]  People are still playing Pokemon Go, man.
[51:22.830 --> 51:23.670]  I went somewhere the other day
[51:23.670 --> 51:25.510]  and they're walking around playing Pokemon Go.
[51:25.510 --> 51:26.790]  I almost ran some kid over.
[51:26.790 --> 51:29.110]  I saw a picture of something up in Springs.
[51:29.110 --> 51:31.310]  There were like 30 people hanging out playing.
[51:31.310 --> 51:33.390]  They do it in spring or in the area
[51:33.390 --> 51:34.230]  where my daughter lives.
[51:34.230 --> 51:36.070]  You can gather and do anything.
[51:36.070 --> 51:38.510]  There are sex clubs, there are bars,
[51:38.510 --> 51:41.790]  there are Elks Lodges.
[51:41.790 --> 51:44.710]  People gather and play Magic the Gathering.
[51:45.470 --> 51:46.310]  That we don't have a place
[51:46.310 --> 51:48.150]  where two people can get together,
[51:48.150 --> 51:50.110]  order a cheeseburger, a milkshake,
[51:50.110 --> 51:52.950]  take a couple dabs, have a conversation
[51:52.950 --> 51:55.150]  and grab a Uber home is just nuts.
[51:56.750 --> 51:58.130]  It's not that complicated.
[51:58.130 --> 51:59.130]  It's not that tricky.
[51:59.130 --> 52:01.150]  It sure as fuck ain't scary.
[52:01.150 --> 52:03.390]  Like if we can have shooting ranges and bars,
[52:03.390 --> 52:05.370]  like we can figure out weed clubs.
[52:06.470 --> 52:08.470]  We definitely need that in the law.
[52:10.830 --> 52:14.350]  Other components, the public education component
[52:14.990 --> 52:16.590]  on some of the products we offer.
[52:17.390 --> 52:19.950]  The way I've explained the edibles thing to other people,
[52:19.950 --> 52:22.190]  like my mom for example,
[52:23.510 --> 52:26.110]  because a lot of people right when legalization happened,
[52:26.110 --> 52:28.830]  came to Colorado to check it out,
[52:28.830 --> 52:31.430]  bought the candy bar because they thought it was cute,
[52:31.430 --> 52:33.530]  went back to their hotel room,
[52:33.530 --> 52:36.370]  ate the whole candy bar and lost their shit.
[52:36.370 --> 52:39.390]  We've talked about Maureen Dowd's famous
[52:39.390 --> 52:42.830]  edible nightmare on the show before.
[52:42.830 --> 52:45.630]  There are several other fairly famous incidents
[52:45.630 --> 52:49.630]  where a big name reporter or a celebrity came here,
[52:49.630 --> 52:54.470]  Ralph May, and had some trouble with edibles.
[52:54.470 --> 52:57.750]  But we could solve that all on the front end
[52:57.750 --> 52:59.910]  with just a simple education campaign
[52:59.910 --> 53:02.230]  and better packaging and labeling.
[53:02.230 --> 53:05.350]  The packaging and labeling thing we already did.
[53:05.350 --> 53:07.110]  But there's still people out there in the world
[53:07.110 --> 53:08.710]  that don't read labels.
[53:08.710 --> 53:09.630]  They buy a candy bar,
[53:09.630 --> 53:11.790]  they shove the whole thing down their throat
[53:11.790 --> 53:15.630]  and wonder why they got way too highly afterwards.
[53:15.630 --> 53:18.030]  And it's the same thing with teenagers and booze.
[53:18.030 --> 53:20.610]  They consume way too much the first couple times
[53:20.610 --> 53:21.450]  out of the gate,
[53:21.450 --> 53:24.670]  not understanding what they're dealing with and consuming.
[53:24.670 --> 53:25.990]  And they end up sick over it.
[53:25.990 --> 53:28.870]  And it's not that interesting or nuanced.
[53:28.870 --> 53:30.270]  It's just that's what happens
[53:30.270 --> 53:32.910]  when you don't read the label and dive in head first.
[53:34.190 --> 53:35.870]  And we could prevent a lot of that
[53:35.870 --> 53:38.310]  with just upfront education.
[53:38.310 --> 53:41.750]  Colorado's got a program called the Good to Know Campaign.
[53:42.590 --> 53:44.190]  A lot of it's kind of cheesy,
[53:44.190 --> 53:46.910]  but a lot of the messages they make are great.
[53:46.910 --> 53:48.310]  I learned shit from that thing.
[53:48.310 --> 53:49.350]  I'm like, oh, I didn't know that.
[53:49.350 --> 53:51.830]  That's a cool little thing I didn't know.
[53:51.830 --> 53:55.230]  The first campaign Colorado funded was just so stupid.
[53:55.230 --> 53:58.130]  It was called Don't Be a Lab Rat.
[53:58.130 --> 54:01.490]  And it was laughed at by everybody on the planet.
[54:02.910 --> 54:07.310]  We spent a fortune to put giant rat cages around Denver.
[54:07.310 --> 54:10.350]  And within an hour of them starting to drop off the cages,
[54:10.350 --> 54:13.070]  it became the thing to do to smoke weed in the cage
[54:13.070 --> 54:14.970]  and take a picture for social media.
[54:16.310 --> 54:18.670]  Within a week, all the cages were taken down
[54:18.670 --> 54:20.470]  and it's some scrapyard.
[54:20.470 --> 54:22.050]  And they were back at the drawing board
[54:22.050 --> 54:24.790]  and they decided to just say, fuck it
[54:24.790 --> 54:29.550]  and go with actual research, verifiable,
[54:29.550 --> 54:31.590]  honest health information.
[54:31.590 --> 54:32.430]  You'll hear on the radio.
[54:32.430 --> 54:35.590]  And warnings about Colorado law and how to follow it.
[54:35.590 --> 54:38.630]  You'll hear on the radio or you'll see on a commercial,
[54:38.630 --> 54:40.270]  you'll see things like, hey, did you know?
[54:41.110 --> 54:41.990]  And it'll show a little car cruising around
[54:41.990 --> 54:42.950]  with a couple of people in it.
[54:42.950 --> 54:45.790]  They look like it's an animation and it's real soft colors.
[54:45.790 --> 54:47.070]  Like, did you know that it's illegal
[54:47.070 --> 54:49.110]  to have cannabis in a state park?
[54:49.110 --> 54:51.590]  And at first I was like, oh yeah, I forgot.
[54:51.590 --> 54:52.430]  I didn't even think of that.
[54:52.430 --> 54:53.310]  Federal land.
[54:53.310 --> 54:55.590]  Yeah, but that commercial tells everybody.
[54:55.590 --> 54:56.510]  And they're like, did you also know
[54:56.510 --> 54:58.990]  that you can't fly out of here with your cannabis?
[54:58.990 --> 55:00.670]  Please leave your stuff in Colorado.
[55:00.670 --> 55:03.870]  And it's just simple shit that maybe it's common sense
[55:03.870 --> 55:06.310]  for most people, but maybe you didn't think about it
[55:06.310 --> 55:07.150]  that way.
[55:07.150 --> 55:08.630]  Some people don't even realize that this is something
[55:08.670 --> 55:11.270]  that you can buy here, but if you leave with it,
[55:11.270 --> 55:12.750]  you're fucked if you get caught.
[55:12.750 --> 55:15.510]  Right outside of Colorado, they can fuck your life up.
[55:16.390 --> 55:20.310]  Wyoming, the state of Wyoming just released a thing saying,
[55:21.270 --> 55:23.470]  hey, there's a lot of people coming here
[55:23.470 --> 55:25.990]  for the eclipse that's coming.
[55:25.990 --> 55:30.710]  A lot of you are set and planning to come through Colorado.
[55:30.710 --> 55:34.350]  Please leave your weed on the Colorado side of the border.
[55:34.350 --> 55:36.870]  And I was like, you hypocritical fucks.
[55:37.190 --> 55:39.510]  Leave your fireworks on your side of the border then.
[55:39.510 --> 55:41.150]  No, no.
[55:41.150 --> 55:43.470]  But there's a lot of stuff where you can have it here
[55:43.470 --> 55:46.190]  and you can't have it there, but no one cares
[55:46.190 --> 55:47.670]  if you cross the line and buy it
[55:47.670 --> 55:49.790]  and take some home for personal use.
[55:49.790 --> 55:51.110]  Not the case with marijuana.
[55:51.110 --> 55:52.710]  They care very much on the other side of the border.
[55:52.710 --> 55:56.590]  We bought way too many fireworks one year in Wyoming.
[55:56.590 --> 55:58.870]  We got pulled over and they took those motherfuckers from us.
[55:58.870 --> 56:02.750]  Yep, but there weren't parents groups
[56:02.750 --> 56:04.390]  warning about the date.
[56:04.390 --> 56:05.750]  It's just so silly.
[56:05.790 --> 56:07.550]  The people in Nebraska really give a shit.
[56:07.550 --> 56:09.790]  There were like six boys that drove to Wyoming in a van
[56:09.790 --> 56:12.230]  to go spend all of our summer savings on fucking fireworks.
[56:12.230 --> 56:13.870]  It was just like, let's get it.
[56:13.870 --> 56:17.150]  That's where most of Pueblo's tax returns go.
[56:17.150 --> 56:17.990]  That's funny.
[56:17.990 --> 56:20.790]  All right, let's move forward after that comment.
[56:20.790 --> 56:24.310]  Our listener, Canuck, our Canuck friend says,
[56:24.310 --> 56:27.110]  I hope I'm saying that right too, Canuck, Canuck.
[56:27.110 --> 56:27.950]  I don't know.
[56:27.950 --> 56:30.990]  It's not meant in a derogatory fashion, I promise.
[56:30.990 --> 56:33.590]  No, yeah, yeah, I know what it means.
[56:33.590 --> 56:35.110]  I've never said the word.
[56:35.950 --> 56:36.790]  No.
[56:40.950 --> 56:41.790]  Smart, okay.
[56:41.790 --> 56:43.790]  He says, hopefully we can skip a few of the missteps
[56:43.790 --> 56:45.150]  and end up with some smart rules
[56:45.150 --> 56:48.510]  for the legal growing distribution and use of cannabis.
[56:48.510 --> 56:51.310]  Thanks to your podcast and Mike's clear explanations,
[56:51.310 --> 56:54.190]  we will be better equipped to step up and be heard
[56:54.190 --> 56:56.670]  if things start heading in the wrong direction.
[56:56.670 --> 56:58.990]  There you go, ready to step up.
[56:58.990 --> 56:59.830]  Good work, Mike.
[56:59.830 --> 57:00.910]  You've taught the people well.
[57:00.910 --> 57:04.230]  Definitely be ready to step up, because it's coming.
[57:04.310 --> 57:06.430]  That's one thing I did not expect.
[57:06.430 --> 57:08.070]  I should have, in retrospect.
[57:08.950 --> 57:11.030]  But I did not expect anti-pop people
[57:11.030 --> 57:13.030]  to just come flying out of the woodwork.
[57:15.070 --> 57:16.190]  And there's quite a few of them.
[57:16.190 --> 57:18.470]  There are a lot of people without a lot to do
[57:19.670 --> 57:20.510]  in the evenings.
[57:20.510 --> 57:21.670]  The best way to put it, too.
[57:21.670 --> 57:24.030]  And, I mean, seriously, you read the interviews
[57:24.030 --> 57:26.630]  with these people, like, there was one in,
[57:28.910 --> 57:30.310]  I don't even remember the magazine.
[57:30.310 --> 57:32.630]  It was a major East Coast magazine, something out of Boston.
[57:32.670 --> 57:34.270]  I'm gonna feel dumb if it was the Boston Globe.
[57:34.270 --> 57:35.870]  Might have been the Boston Globe.
[57:36.870 --> 57:38.590]  Where she's describing how she got into
[57:38.590 --> 57:40.830]  leading an anti-pop group.
[57:40.830 --> 57:42.430]  And she's like, we were driving home one day,
[57:42.430 --> 57:44.430]  and my kid was like, what's that?
[57:44.430 --> 57:45.750]  And I didn't know how to tell him
[57:45.750 --> 57:48.190]  about the new weed store in town.
[57:48.190 --> 57:51.430]  And it's like, what'd you say when he pointed
[57:51.430 --> 57:54.350]  at the gun store, the liquor store, the titty bar,
[57:54.350 --> 57:57.790]  the homeless person urinating on the street sign,
[57:57.790 --> 57:59.790]  the lady hooking on Lake?
[57:59.830 --> 58:03.470]  Like, seriously, like, you're a parent.
[58:03.470 --> 58:05.870]  Like, if you can't figure out how to be like,
[58:05.870 --> 58:09.390]  well, son, some people like to consume marijuana.
[58:09.390 --> 58:10.470]  It's a thing that adults do.
[58:10.470 --> 58:12.590]  You don't really know about till it's older.
[58:12.590 --> 58:15.590]  If you see that little green cross thing, just ignore it.
[58:15.590 --> 58:17.750]  They don't have nothing you need or want.
[58:17.750 --> 58:19.110]  Like, it's simple.
[58:19.110 --> 58:22.630]  What's three X's in the blinky lady mean, mommy?
[58:22.630 --> 58:24.750]  It means there's a sad man who doesn't have people
[58:24.750 --> 58:25.870]  to talk to when he gets home,
[58:25.870 --> 58:28.270]  and that's where he spends all his $1 bills.
[58:28.270 --> 58:29.670]  Like, it ain't that fucking hard.
[58:30.550 --> 58:31.390]  Just be a parent.
[58:31.390 --> 58:32.630]  But instead of doing that,
[58:32.630 --> 58:34.350]  she decided that she was gonna get together
[58:34.350 --> 58:36.430]  with her church friends and try to chase the pot
[58:36.430 --> 58:40.910]  sort of town, because that's easier than honestly
[58:40.910 --> 58:43.310]  educating your child to survive a dangerous world.
[58:43.310 --> 58:46.230]  Social justice warriors were way better than parents now.
[58:46.230 --> 58:49.110]  Right, like, and as far as I'm concerned,
[58:49.110 --> 58:51.030]  it's like, instead of teaching them how to cross,
[58:51.030 --> 58:53.110]  look both ways before they cross the street,
[58:53.110 --> 58:55.790]  you tried to get all cars prohibited.
[58:56.030 --> 59:00.070]  Like, yeah, it would make crossing the street safer.
[59:00.070 --> 59:01.070]  I'll give you that one.
[59:01.070 --> 59:03.510]  Yep, but now I gotta fucking walk everywhere, lady.
[59:03.510 --> 59:06.390]  Now the FedEx guy's gotta carry all that shit in a backpack.
[59:06.390 --> 59:07.230]  I'm gonna push your kid down
[59:07.230 --> 59:08.430]  every time I walk by him, too.
[59:08.430 --> 59:10.470]  Like, it's just, it's not practical
[59:10.470 --> 59:13.150]  for the world we live in, and that's part of the reason
[59:13.150 --> 59:15.590]  trolling them is so easy on my Facebook page.
[59:15.590 --> 59:16.710]  All right, so the email keeps going.
[59:16.710 --> 59:19.710]  He says, where did I leave off?
[59:19.710 --> 59:21.830]  Yeah, sorry for the long email, dude.
[59:21.830 --> 59:24.110]  Don't be, this is a beautiful email.
[59:24.110 --> 59:24.950]  And in the start of the email,
[59:24.950 --> 59:26.790]  I remember you said that you wanted some advice
[59:26.790 --> 59:29.470]  on stealth growing, and I wrote down stealth episodes
[59:29.470 --> 59:31.830]  so that I could do more talk about a stealth episode.
[59:31.830 --> 59:33.470]  There's a bunch of stuff that's for that,
[59:33.470 --> 59:35.150]  and there's a couple of good videos out, too.
[59:35.150 --> 59:36.630]  There was just a lot of stuff in this email
[59:36.630 --> 59:38.510]  that I wanted to get through, and it took us 30 minutes.
[59:38.510 --> 59:39.830]  We didn't even do the stealth part,
[59:39.830 --> 59:41.670]  so I'm glad that I got all the way through it.
[59:41.670 --> 59:44.590]  He also says, I wanted you to know the respect,
[59:44.590 --> 59:47.710]  and thanks, I send your way for you
[59:47.710 --> 59:50.190]  and your guests is from the heart.
[59:50.190 --> 59:53.470]  And then he says, gratefully, cabinet growing Canuck.
[59:53.470 --> 59:54.310]  Nice.
[59:54.310 --> 59:55.310]  I wanna say thank you.
[59:55.310 --> 59:56.150]  That means a lot.
[59:56.150 --> 59:57.150]  I know I read a lot of emails,
[59:57.150 --> 59:58.390]  and I get a lot of praise on the internet,
[59:58.390 --> 59:59.870]  and all that good stuff, but man,
[59:59.870 --> 01:00:02.110]  all of it matters, and I appreciate all of it.
[01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.030]  And you're a thinker, you're a smart person,
[01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:06.950]  and I love it when smart people are learning from me,
[01:00:06.950 --> 01:00:08.550]  and we're lifting everybody up together.
[01:00:08.550 --> 01:00:09.390]  This is awesome.
[01:00:09.390 --> 01:00:10.230]  So thank you.
[01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:11.950]  Thank you for doing what you do in Canada.
[01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:14.670]  When the time comes, if you do need to step up
[01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:17.710]  and speak out and have your voice heard, please do it.
[01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:18.790]  Your voice may shake a little.
[01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:19.630]  I don't know who you are.
[01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:20.470]  I don't know what you do.
[01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:24.030]  You may jump up and fucking talk like fucking a celebrity
[01:00:24.790 --> 01:00:25.750]  and get an Oscar speech and just crush it.
[01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:26.870]  But you may be a nervous person.
[01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:27.790]  You may get a little shaky.
[01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:28.710]  Your feet may get sweaty.
[01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:29.670]  Your palms may get sweaty.
[01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:31.110]  Your mouth may get all dry.
[01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:33.230]  Just say what you have to say and just say it.
[01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:35.670]  I'm so glad it's hard to find video.
[01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:37.650]  It's not impossible because the places
[01:00:37.650 --> 01:00:39.750]  where you tend to end up speaking about these things
[01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.750]  tend to have audio and video recording.
[01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:44.670]  But I'm glad it's hard to find the video
[01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:49.670]  the first 30 times I spoke in public at city council stuff.
[01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:51.070]  I hate public speaking.
[01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.710]  It still terrifies me.
[01:00:54.550 --> 01:00:57.110]  My heart reacts like I'm going into a fight.
[01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:00.970]  When I go up and sit down at the microphone,
[01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:03.350]  I know what I wanna say.
[01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:05.110]  I know how I wanna say it.
[01:01:06.550 --> 01:01:09.550]  And there's a thing in boxing that they say,
[01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.310]  like everybody has a plan until they get hit.
[01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.110]  Like they say it in a lot of movies.
[01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.450]  And for me, public speaking wise,
[01:01:15.450 --> 01:01:18.030]  that's true until I get down to the microphone
[01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:21.230]  and I go, good evening, city council,
[01:01:21.230 --> 01:01:22.950]  the county commissioners or whatever.
[01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:25.070]  As soon as I'm done saying the name
[01:01:25.070 --> 01:01:28.390]  of whoever I'm addressing, I have no more plan anymore.
[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:29.310]  I've been hit.
[01:01:29.310 --> 01:01:30.750]  It's game on.
[01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:33.030]  I try to stick to the strategy and the layout
[01:01:33.030 --> 01:01:34.850]  and the talking points I came in.
[01:01:34.850 --> 01:01:38.150]  But at one point, I literally said,
[01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:41.070]  I was pointing out how much money this city was missing
[01:01:41.070 --> 01:01:43.290]  by not allowing marijuana stores.
[01:01:43.290 --> 01:01:45.990]  I listed the total that the county had done in sales
[01:01:45.990 --> 01:01:47.910]  and it was some nutty number for Pueblo,
[01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:50.710]  like 1.8 or 1.7 million.
[01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:52.830]  I was woohooed right into the microphone.
[01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:54.590]  I fucking outgored it.
[01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:57.790]  And afterwards, the guy that does the recording
[01:01:57.790 --> 01:01:59.790]  for the city council came running up
[01:01:59.790 --> 01:02:01.390]  and gave me a big bear hug and he was like,
[01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:02.910]  that was the coolest thing that's ever happened
[01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:03.750]  in this room.
[01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.030]  And I'm like, no, that was the dumbest thing
[01:02:05.030 --> 01:02:06.730]  that's ever happened in this room.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:10.590]  But shit like that happens just because it's terrifying.
[01:02:10.590 --> 01:02:13.070]  People have weird reactions to it.
[01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.270]  But don't be afraid of that shit.
[01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:17.270]  Everyone who's ever spoken in public understands
[01:02:17.270 --> 01:02:19.350]  what you're going through.
[01:02:19.350 --> 01:02:21.230]  This guy could be a lawyer, you know what I'm saying?
[01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:24.030]  So he could be used to this, but still, if you're not,
[01:02:24.030 --> 01:02:24.870]  sometimes you-
[01:02:24.870 --> 01:02:27.070]  Just get up and rock the mic, man.
[01:02:27.070 --> 01:02:29.370]  And if you're not comfortable being the face,
[01:02:29.370 --> 01:02:32.830]  there's a lot of ways to support smart policy
[01:02:32.830 --> 01:02:37.230]  or support legalization anonymously now.
[01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:39.070]  Facebook makes it real easy, bro.
[01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.350]  If you don't know how, shoot me a message, I'll help.
[01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.390]  Pueblo for sensible cannabis laws on Facebook.
[01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:47.950]  There's, I mean, dozens and dozens and dozens of ways
[01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:52.710]  for you to fight for what you wanna fight for
[01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:55.290]  without opening yourself up to a lot of blowback
[01:02:55.290 --> 01:02:56.190]  or consequences.
[01:02:56.190 --> 01:02:58.470]  And I'm happy to help anyone do that.
[01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:01.110]  Anyone, not just our Canug friend.
[01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.550]  Anybody that wants to stand up for cannabis
[01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:05.110]  and move it forward with us.
[01:03:05.110 --> 01:03:06.530]  Hey Mike, we've been going for an hour.
[01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:08.510]  You wanna wrap up the show and take a couple of dabs
[01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:09.370]  and call it a day?
[01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:11.950]  Sure, I could keep going.
[01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:13.110]  I don't know.
[01:03:13.110 --> 01:03:14.670]  We have a podcast in a minute, bro.
[01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:15.550]  This is a lot of fun.
[01:03:15.550 --> 01:03:18.390]  And honestly, good emails like that.
[01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:19.990]  It feels like we weren't at work today.
[01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:21.390]  I'm like, dude, let's do another email.
[01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:23.270]  I gotta go back tomorrow, so we gotta wrap it up.
[01:03:23.270 --> 01:03:26.430]  I know, it's getting late, we're getting tired.
[01:03:26.430 --> 01:03:27.550]  That was a great email.
[01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:29.750]  Thank you, Cabinet Growing Canug.
[01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:30.790]  Yes, great email.
[01:03:30.790 --> 01:03:32.230]  Hey, I've got a stack of emails.
[01:03:32.230 --> 01:03:33.230]  Mike sees this folder.
[01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:34.150]  Look at all these papers, bro.
[01:03:34.150 --> 01:03:34.990]  Those are all fresh emails that we gotta get through.
[01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:38.550]  It might take us a minute to do a good stealth
[01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:39.670]  growing episode.
[01:03:39.670 --> 01:03:44.630]  In the meantime, some time on Google and YouTube,
[01:03:44.670 --> 01:03:47.390]  you might be able to find a good couple of videos
[01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:49.990]  produced by High Times.
[01:03:49.990 --> 01:03:51.630]  We'll come up with some good, sure.
[01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:53.950]  There's a lot of good stuff that you can go
[01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:55.870]  where people have already had this question
[01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:58.190]  because it was prohibited for so long.
[01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:00.190]  A lot of that stuff got published,
[01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.510]  but that sounds like a fun show to do.
[01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:03.470]  I'm looking forward to doing it.
[01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:04.590]  We'll definitely knock that one out.
[01:04:04.590 --> 01:04:05.430]  It won't be too hard.
[01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:06.630]  I know some tricks.
[01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:08.510]  Carbon filters, that's your main thing.
[01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:10.190]  Extra carbon filters.
[01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:11.030]  All right.
[01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:12.470]  Walk around your place at night.
[01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:14.590]  Yeah, see if you can smell anything, hear anything.
[01:04:15.350 --> 01:04:16.190]  Listen a lot.
[01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:17.230]  Look for light leaks.
[01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:18.430]  All right, we'll do a whole episode on it.
[01:04:18.430 --> 01:04:19.950]  Let's not burn it out now.
[01:04:19.950 --> 01:04:22.030]  Make sure you follow Mike on Facebook.
[01:04:22.030 --> 01:04:24.110]  It's the Pueblo for Sensible Cannabis Laws.
[01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:26.310]  Also follow him on Twitter and Instagram.
[01:04:26.310 --> 01:04:27.670]  It's NemoPunk15.
[01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:28.830]  You can find me on Facebook.
[01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:30.670]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart Podcast.
[01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:31.510]  Find me on Twitter.
[01:04:31.510 --> 01:04:34.910]  It's at GFYH Podcast on Instagram.
[01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:36.630]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've got like 15.
[01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:37.470]  I don't wanna lie.
[01:04:37.470 --> 01:04:40.950]  I think I got, I'm pretty close to 15,000 followers,
[01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:41.830]  I think, on Instagram now.
[01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.270]  I posted a photo the other day.
[01:04:43.310 --> 01:04:44.630]  I got over 2,000 likes.
[01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:47.230]  I'm at 2,200 and something likes by now.
[01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:48.790]  I would appreciate it if you follow me
[01:04:48.790 --> 01:04:50.670]  and check out my photography on Instagram.
[01:04:50.670 --> 01:04:54.470]  It's Irie, I-R-I-E underscore genetics.
[01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.230]  Irie Genetics on Instagram.
[01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:58.710]  Irie underscore genetics, lots of photography.
[01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:59.550]  You'll love it.
[01:04:59.550 --> 01:05:00.390]  See what I'm up to.
[01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:01.210]  See what I'm growing.
[01:05:01.210 --> 01:05:02.070]  See what I'm breeding.
[01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:02.910]  See what I got going on.
[01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:04.790]  I don't post any pictures of myself or anything.
[01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:05.630]  Not anymore.
[01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:07.350]  There are probably pictures of myself on there,
[01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.150]  but it's all just weed plants, cannabis photography.
[01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:12.190]  Some gorgeous photography.
[01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:14.630]  If you're into the cannabis plant
[01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:17.030]  and find a lot of beauty there,
[01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:19.230]  this Instagram feed's pretty phenomenal.
[01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:20.390]  There's some purple plants.
[01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:21.670]  There's some green plants.
[01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:22.510]  There's some red plants.
[01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:24.350]  I sent a friend there not too long ago.
[01:05:24.350 --> 01:05:26.550]  She was asking me if I had photos from the grow,
[01:05:26.550 --> 01:05:30.070]  and I said, oh, just go check out my buddy's Instagram.
[01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.790]  He's a way better photographer than I am,
[01:05:31.790 --> 01:05:32.670]  and I'm busy right now.
[01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:34.430]  I don't have time for the photos.
[01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.310]  And 15 minutes later, I get a text that's like,
[01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.750]  I had no idea it came in so many colors.
[01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:39.590]  Yeah.
[01:05:39.590 --> 01:05:40.430]  It's like, yep.
[01:05:40.430 --> 01:05:41.790]  Yeah, it's not just green all the time.
[01:05:42.590 --> 01:05:44.670]  I thought it came in green and brown.
[01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:46.950]  Oh, yep.
[01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:47.790]  Where was I?
[01:05:47.790 --> 01:05:49.710]  Also, ladies and gentlemen, I appreciate great emails.
[01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:51.910]  If you've got a grow question that I have not answered yet,
[01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.710]  if you're curious about something,
[01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:56.670]  if you wanna know, I'll read all the emails you send me
[01:05:56.670 --> 01:05:58.190]  and I'll see, maybe I'll bring them to the show,
[01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:59.110]  even if they're strange,
[01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:01.990]  even if you just ask me something awkward.
[01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.830]  See if I can answer it.
[01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:05.070]  I may just set myself up for trolling just now.
[01:06:05.070 --> 01:06:07.670]  Anyway, it's growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:08.710]  I would love to hear from you.
[01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:11.350]  Also, like I mentioned earlier, YouTube.
[01:06:11.350 --> 01:06:13.750]  Make sure you check out the videos on YouTube.
[01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:16.390]  Go to YouTube, search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:17.230]  You can't miss it.
[01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:18.990]  Also, Patreon.
[01:06:18.990 --> 01:06:20.710]  I know I talk about Patreon quite often.
[01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.870]  Patreon is a service that will allow you as a listener
[01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:25.390]  to financially support the podcast.
[01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.550]  If you feel like the podcast was a couple of bucks,
[01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:30.270]  go to patreon.com slash growfromyourheart.
[01:06:30.270 --> 01:06:32.990]  It will show you all of the steps on signing up,
[01:06:32.990 --> 01:06:34.470]  on contributing to the show.
[01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:35.750]  And I'm not trying to beg for money.
[01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:38.430]  It does cost me a few bucks to put this podcast up.
[01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:40.230]  I have a website where I host the show.
[01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:41.150]  There's a fee for that.
[01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:42.790]  There's a lot of bandwidth.
[01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:43.630]  The episodes are huge.
[01:06:43.630 --> 01:06:45.350]  There are three-hour podcasts up there.
[01:06:45.350 --> 01:06:47.390]  I make sure that it's all available for you.
[01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:48.310]  I cover that.
[01:06:48.310 --> 01:06:49.870]  But if you'd like to help,
[01:06:49.870 --> 01:06:51.430]  that's what that will help me cover.
[01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:53.110]  So thanks to everybody who has contributed.
[01:06:53.110 --> 01:06:54.950]  I've gotten quite a few contributions lately.
[01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:56.670]  I appreciate you.
[01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:58.110]  Enough begging on Patreon.
[01:06:58.110 --> 01:06:59.310]  Go check it out.
[01:06:59.310 --> 01:07:00.350]  Mike, you got anything else to say
[01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.910]  before we wrap up the podcast?
[01:07:02.910 --> 01:07:06.350]  Thank you to everybody who's been by the Facebook page.
[01:07:06.350 --> 01:07:08.270]  In the last couple of weeks,
[01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:11.550]  the number of likes, shares, comments,
[01:07:11.550 --> 01:07:13.190]  and then, I don't know,
[01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:15.430]  if you run some social media stuff,
[01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:18.390]  you know about some of the analytics you get.
[01:07:18.390 --> 01:07:21.190]  Our post reach has been exploding lately.
[01:07:22.270 --> 01:07:24.350]  And we just want to say thank you for all of that.
[01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:27.070]  The likes, the shares, the comments.
[01:07:27.070 --> 01:07:28.750]  All of that helps our message
[01:07:28.750 --> 01:07:31.390]  and the pro-legalization message reach more people.
[01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:36.350]  And I very much appreciate the likes and the shares
[01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:37.550]  and helping spread that message.
[01:07:37.550 --> 01:07:39.230]  Thank you so much, everybody.
[01:07:39.230 --> 01:07:40.190]  Yeah, thanks for the support, you guys.
[01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:41.750]  We truly do appreciate it.
[01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:44.390]  I would love it if you tell two friends about the podcast.
[01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:45.230]  Go tell two people.
[01:07:45.230 --> 01:07:46.190]  Maybe they'll tell two people.
[01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:47.590]  Also, you know what?
[01:07:47.590 --> 01:07:50.310]  Please go to iTunes and leave a review.
[01:07:50.310 --> 01:07:51.310]  Go to iTunes.
[01:07:51.310 --> 01:07:52.630]  Go to the iTunes store.
[01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:54.230]  Search for the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:56.470]  Right in the middle, it says Ratings and Reviews.
[01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:57.470]  Type in a little review.
[01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:58.830]  Let me know what you think of the podcast.
[01:07:58.830 --> 01:08:02.710]  Also, so far, everybody has given me a five-star review.
[01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:04.990]  Click on the amount of stars you feel like I deserve
[01:08:04.990 --> 01:08:08.790]  and I will read your review on a future episode.
[01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.630]  All right, sounds good.
[01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:11.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, I feel like I'm asking a lot of you
[01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:13.790]  on this podcast to help me on a Patreon,
[01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:14.950]  give me an iTunes review,
[01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:16.870]  follow me on all the social media.
[01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:18.070]  I don't mean to sound like a beggar.
[01:08:18.070 --> 01:08:18.910]  I love you guys.
[01:08:18.910 --> 01:08:20.550]  Thanks for all the support that you give me.
[01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:21.390]  Love you guys.
[01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:22.230]  Thanks for listening.
[01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:23.310]  Yes, speaking of love,
[01:08:23.310 --> 01:08:25.510]  I'm gonna give a huge shout out to somebody the other day.
[01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:28.670]  I just had like fucking three Mondays in a row this week.
[01:08:28.670 --> 01:08:29.870]  I don't know what the hell happened.
[01:08:29.870 --> 01:08:31.350]  I had a bunch of Mondays this week, too.
[01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:32.910]  Yeah, we got our asses kicked in the grill.
[01:08:32.910 --> 01:08:34.390]  It wasn't anything that we couldn't handle,
[01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:37.830]  but some weeks, like we lost a person
[01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:40.590]  and hired three new people and fucking trimmed a whole crop
[01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.470]  and had another person come through
[01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:44.390]  and had a Department of Ag inspection the other day
[01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:45.350]  and we have construction.
[01:08:45.350 --> 01:08:47.950]  We've got an entire room full of construction workers.
[01:08:47.950 --> 01:08:50.190]  It's been, it was a week of fucking Mondays.
[01:08:50.190 --> 01:08:53.550]  There were maybe 30 people in the building this week
[01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.510]  that weren't in the building the previous two weeks.
[01:08:55.510 --> 01:08:56.550]  It's been hectic.
[01:08:56.550 --> 01:08:57.750]  Yeah, it's been crazy.
[01:08:57.750 --> 01:08:59.430]  A very, very busy week.
[01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.910]  I feel like I've been going at 100 miles an hour
[01:09:01.910 --> 01:09:02.790]  since Monday.
[01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:03.630]  Yes.
[01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:07.430]  I swear to, at least four days this week,
[01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:12.350]  I had some crazy event happen pre or post work.
[01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:13.190]  Where?
[01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:14.190]  Grower life, dude.
[01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:16.430]  Tire blew up, dog went insane.
[01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:18.790]  Like, there's a lot of stuff in there.
[01:09:18.790 --> 01:09:20.710]  It's just a lot of Mondays this week, bro.
[01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:21.550]  Lots of Mondays.
[01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:22.750]  I can't believe we even got a show in this week.
[01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:25.750]  No, I knew, I don't wanna say I won't miss a show,
[01:09:25.750 --> 01:09:26.750]  but I'll get a show out.
[01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:29.030]  No, if you and me found time to get together
[01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:31.230]  and put together a podcast, not you missing a show,
[01:09:31.230 --> 01:09:32.230]  you wouldn't do that.
[01:09:32.270 --> 01:09:34.710]  Yeah, yeah, it took us a minute to coordinate this.
[01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:36.150]  But anyway, what I was saying is,
[01:09:36.150 --> 01:09:39.430]  I was having a fucking, a string of Mondays
[01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:42.030]  and the beautiful and always lovely,
[01:09:42.030 --> 01:09:44.030]  the always wonderful, Dab and Granny,
[01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:45.190]  just happened to FaceTime me.
[01:09:45.190 --> 01:09:46.550]  I happened to sit down at my computer.
[01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:47.710]  I was like, I'm gonna sit down,
[01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.030]  check out whatever's going on on the internet.
[01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:50.470]  I'm gonna take a couple of dabs in my phone,
[01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:53.630]  did the little FaceTime ring, the do, do, do, do, do, do,
[01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:54.470]  and I was like, who is this?
[01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.350]  And it was Miss Dab and Granny.
[01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:57.190]  I was like, what's up, beautiful?
[01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.110]  And we hung out.
[01:09:58.110 --> 01:10:02.790]  We took a couple of dabs on FaceTime there and hung out.
[01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:04.870]  It's fun dabbing with Granny on FaceTime.
[01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:09.550]  It's, I gotta use the video phone more.
[01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:11.710]  It's the convenience there.
[01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.430]  I mean, it saves you guys,
[01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:15.710]  which saves at least one of you an hour and a half in the car.
[01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:18.150]  Yeah, and we're both just sitting here dabbing, hanging out.
[01:10:18.150 --> 01:10:18.990]  And it was really nice.
[01:10:18.990 --> 01:10:20.830]  We're having a string of Mondays.
[01:10:20.830 --> 01:10:22.550]  Miss Dab and Granny's always got a kind heart.
[01:10:22.550 --> 01:10:24.910]  She always warms up your day, puts a big smile on your face.
[01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:26.310]  Yeah, she's a great lady.
[01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:29.270]  So I wanna give you a huge shout out to Miss Dab and Granny.
[01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:31.030]  Love you, Gail, every single day.
[01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:32.230]  I haven't seen you in a while.
[01:10:32.230 --> 01:10:33.310]  We're gonna do a podcast.
[01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:34.510]  We've got a couple of podcasts.
[01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:36.710]  Actually, her and I have a couple things lined up.
[01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.550]  We're gonna do some podcasts together.
[01:10:37.550 --> 01:10:39.470]  If you get Granny over here for a podcast.
