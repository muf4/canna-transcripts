[00:00.190 --> 00:36.240]  Yeah, welcome to the show, Podcast World.
[00:36.240 --> 00:38.960]  I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff.
[00:38.960 --> 00:44.280]  This is episode 737 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:44.280 --> 00:47.920]  In this episode, I'm going to focus on an email about stretchy plants.
[00:47.920 --> 00:51.240]  Before I get to that part of the show, let's do a few shout outs to a few of the great
[00:51.240 --> 00:55.340]  folks who continue to support the show on Patreon.
[00:55.340 --> 00:59.200]  Let's kick it off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my friend
[00:59.200 --> 01:00.200]  ADHD Grower.
[01:00.200 --> 01:04.120]  I want to send a fist bump and a thank you shout out to my buddy OG Roach and the Devil
[01:04.120 --> 01:05.120]  Weed.
[01:05.120 --> 01:08.920]  Let's send a thank you shout out to a longtime supporter, Gnomey by my guacamole.
[01:08.920 --> 01:11.920]  Let's send a big fist bump and a thank you shout out to Grow Man Stan.
[01:11.920 --> 01:14.760]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Romy1Kenobi.
[01:14.760 --> 01:17.400]  Let's send a big old fist bump and a thank you shout out to StashDrop269.
[01:17.400 --> 01:21.180]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to my buddy Kip.
[01:21.220 --> 01:23.140]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Grow Bandit.
[01:23.140 --> 01:24.700]  Let's send a big fist bump to Quazi.
[01:24.700 --> 01:28.700]  Then let's wrap it all up with a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out
[01:28.700 --> 01:30.580]  to our friend Reaper.
[01:30.580 --> 01:35.420]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.
[01:35.420 --> 01:39.340]  If you are not already supporting the show and you would like to learn how to do so,
[01:39.340 --> 01:45.620]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[01:45.620 --> 01:48.340]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[01:48.340 --> 01:52.340]  And you know I do include that link in the show notes and in the video description to
[01:52.340 --> 01:56.540]  make it nice and easy for all of my friends to support the show.
[01:56.540 --> 02:00.700]  I do want to send a big thank you to everybody who sent me feedback on the last couple of
[02:00.700 --> 02:01.700]  episodes.
[02:01.700 --> 02:05.660]  I got a lot of responses to the episode about pollinating a male plant.
[02:05.660 --> 02:11.060]  I did get a lot of responses to the episode about 420 so thank you for all of that feedback,
[02:11.060 --> 02:12.500]  all of those responses.
[02:12.500 --> 02:15.660]  I did get a lot of questions about reversing a male plant.
[02:15.660 --> 02:19.620]  A previous episode was about pollinating a male plant with another male plant.
[02:19.620 --> 02:22.060]  I did explain that that simply isn't possible.
[02:22.060 --> 02:23.060]  That is a sword fight.
[02:23.060 --> 02:26.860]  I also did get a lot of messages saying maybe you could reverse a male.
[02:26.860 --> 02:28.780]  I'm going to talk about that in the future.
[02:28.780 --> 02:30.260]  I did add that to my notes.
[02:30.260 --> 02:32.940]  That is upcoming in the future so stay tuned.
[02:32.940 --> 02:37.260]  There will be an episode with a little bit of talk about reversing a male plant to see
[02:37.260 --> 02:40.580]  maybe what it might look like as a female plant.
[02:40.580 --> 02:44.220]  Now before I get any further I do want to also send a big thank you to everybody who
[02:44.220 --> 02:48.020]  made recommendations for new strain names.
[02:48.020 --> 02:49.380]  That's right I am a seed breeder.
[02:49.380 --> 02:53.500]  If you're just watching the podcast you maybe don't know that I am also Iree Genetics Premium
[02:53.500 --> 02:54.500]  Seeds.
[02:54.500 --> 02:59.740]  I am the head breeder, the only breeder, the head dude in charge at Iree Genetics Premium
[02:59.740 --> 03:00.740]  Seeds.
[03:00.740 --> 03:01.740]  That is all me.
[03:01.740 --> 03:06.460]  90% of the work that happens at Iree Genetics Premium Seeds is done by me, by me personally.
[03:06.460 --> 03:09.540]  I breed the seeds, I do the selections, I do most of the packaging.
[03:09.540 --> 03:11.340]  A lot of the stuff happens all by me.
[03:11.340 --> 03:14.780]  But anyway, I am also Iree Genetics Premium Seeds.
[03:14.780 --> 03:19.580]  I am always making new strains, new crosses, new things that need new names.
[03:19.580 --> 03:23.700]  Recently I posted to Instagram and I also posted to my Discord that I've got a new cross
[03:23.700 --> 03:28.200]  that needs a new name and I got an overwhelming amount of responses.
[03:28.200 --> 03:32.420]  Big thanks to everybody who sent a creative name suggestion.
[03:32.420 --> 03:36.060]  If you sent one of those cliche names that has already been taken a thousand times, thanks
[03:36.060 --> 03:37.060]  I guess.
[03:37.060 --> 03:40.940]  But to the people that did do some work and sent me a creative name, extra big thanks,
[03:41.540 --> 03:42.540]  extra salute.
[03:42.540 --> 03:43.540]  I do appreciate that.
[03:43.540 --> 03:44.940]  I have not decided on the name of that cross.
[03:44.940 --> 03:47.100]  I'm not going to talk about what it is here on the show.
[03:47.100 --> 03:49.820]  I'm not going to talk too much about that new strain here on this episode.
[03:49.820 --> 03:53.420]  We'll just keep moving forward because I don't want to flood the YouTube comments with name
[03:53.420 --> 03:54.420]  suggestions.
[03:54.420 --> 03:58.340]  If you were on the Discord, in the general chat there I did ask what the name should
[03:58.340 --> 04:00.540]  be so join the Discord, check it out there.
[04:00.540 --> 04:05.620]  There is a link, by the way, to the new Discord server in the show notes and the video description.
[04:05.620 --> 04:07.620]  I did update and change the Discord.
[04:07.620 --> 04:09.460]  I mentioned that a couple of episodes back.
[04:09.460 --> 04:11.740]  Maybe some people don't listen to every episode.
[04:11.740 --> 04:12.740]  Maybe you haven't found the link.
[04:12.740 --> 04:17.980]  I will include the new Discord link in the show notes and in the video description.
[04:17.980 --> 04:21.860]  Please join us on the new and improved, upgraded, updated Discord server.
[04:21.860 --> 04:24.780]  Big shout out to my mod team for holding it down in there.
[04:24.780 --> 04:31.140]  I just got done in an official iRegenetics Discord mod meeting so we are trying to moderate
[04:31.140 --> 04:35.020]  the server there, trying to keep people happy, keep people satisfied, keep the trolls away,
[04:35.020 --> 04:36.740]  keep the scam artists out of the server.
[04:36.740 --> 04:37.740]  So join us.
[04:37.740 --> 04:39.260]  It is a very welcoming environment.
[04:39.260 --> 04:40.780]  I would love to help you grow.
[04:40.780 --> 04:43.760]  Love to hang out with you in the voice chat, in the video chat.
[04:43.760 --> 04:44.940]  Come jump into the Discord.
[04:44.940 --> 04:45.940]  Where was I?
[04:45.940 --> 04:47.940]  I was talking about strain names.
[04:47.940 --> 04:49.980]  I'm trying to name some new strains.
[04:49.980 --> 04:53.020]  And I've started doing a thing when I make a new line of crosses.
[04:53.020 --> 04:55.860]  I'll take a male plant and pollinate multiple females.
[04:55.860 --> 05:00.340]  Then that batch of seeds will all get named kind of by the same sort of a theme.
[05:00.340 --> 05:02.820]  I've got some fem seeds that will be coming out very soon.
[05:02.820 --> 05:05.740]  They are all kind of loosely named after fish songs.
[05:05.740 --> 05:07.820]  I'm sure you noticed a lot of the Grateful Dead.
[05:07.820 --> 05:08.820]  Maybe you didn't notice.
[05:09.380 --> 05:14.220]  A lot of my Grateful Dog feminized crosses were named after reggae artists.
[05:14.220 --> 05:16.300]  So I tried to kind of bulk them into a group.
[05:16.300 --> 05:17.700]  That helps me remember what they are.
[05:17.700 --> 05:20.140]  It helps me identify what they are.
[05:20.140 --> 05:21.900]  Also it helps other people associate with them.
[05:21.900 --> 05:24.180]  There was also the TMNT line.
[05:24.180 --> 05:27.500]  We had Raphael, Donatello, Leonardo, Michelangelo.
[05:27.500 --> 05:28.980]  There was Shredder, Bebop, Rocksteady.
[05:28.980 --> 05:32.620]  It made it really easy to just say, is the TMNT line sold out?
[05:32.620 --> 05:35.220]  You knew that that was all the reversed blueberries cross.
[05:35.220 --> 05:38.660]  Now all of the fish stuff is actually a reversed afterglow cross.
[05:38.660 --> 05:41.660]  I took the afterglow, reversed that, pollinated a bunch of stuff.
[05:41.660 --> 05:44.220]  All the things from there got named or are being named,
[05:44.220 --> 05:47.980]  loosely named after fish songs or fish associations.
[05:47.980 --> 05:49.700]  We'll talk about that in the future.
[05:49.700 --> 05:51.700]  Some people will understand what the rhombus is
[05:51.700 --> 05:54.100]  and some people simply will not.
[05:54.100 --> 05:55.060]  I am rambling.
[05:55.060 --> 05:57.300]  My point is thank you for the help in naming strain names.
[05:57.300 --> 05:59.500]  I feel like a lot of the good shit is taken.
[05:59.500 --> 06:01.900]  And when people try to give me strain name suggestions,
[06:01.900 --> 06:03.900]  they say things that are already completely taken
[06:03.900 --> 06:05.900]  because we're running out of all the cool shit.
[06:05.900 --> 06:07.460]  I do appreciate the help.
[06:07.460 --> 06:11.700]  I feel that naming a strain can almost make or break that strain.
[06:11.700 --> 06:17.300]  If a really killer strain, a really good cross has a bad name
[06:17.300 --> 06:19.780]  or an unappealing or a non-desirable name,
[06:19.780 --> 06:24.340]  people just don't buy it as much as they would a cross with a really cool name.
[06:24.340 --> 06:28.900]  Sometimes I think I've got the greatest name ideas and it just doesn't work.
[06:28.900 --> 06:30.900]  Saka Souffle and The Machine, for example,
[06:30.900 --> 06:34.420]  those were made together in the same run
[06:34.420 --> 06:38.460]  and they are both kind of named after tributes to two of my favorite comedians.
[06:38.460 --> 06:42.660]  Saka Souffle, of course, is a joke from Tom Segura and Larry King.
[06:42.660 --> 06:44.460]  And then The Machine is Bert Kreischer's,
[06:44.460 --> 06:46.420]  what's one of his most popular jokes ever.
[06:46.420 --> 06:48.140]  That's where those names came from.
[06:48.140 --> 06:49.940]  The Machine sells very well.
[06:49.940 --> 06:52.300]  People don't know what the hell Saka Souffle means,
[06:52.300 --> 06:54.220]  so they just don't buy those seeds.
[06:54.220 --> 06:58.220]  Both crosses are equally powerful, equally as potent,
[06:58.220 --> 07:00.180]  equally they're both badass crosses.
[07:00.180 --> 07:01.940]  I'm equally proud of both of them.
[07:01.940 --> 07:05.500]  But since I named one Saka Souffle, I've got a lot of seeds of that one.
[07:05.500 --> 07:08.540]  Since I named one The Machine, I don't have as many seeds of that left.
[07:08.540 --> 07:13.660]  So that is a good example of how a strain name can make or break a cross.
[07:13.660 --> 07:15.660]  Strawberry Starburst sells real well.
[07:15.660 --> 07:17.060]  Sun Kiss doesn't sell as well.
[07:17.060 --> 07:20.820]  I think they're equally potent, equally powerful plants and seeds,
[07:20.820 --> 07:24.180]  but because of the names, they simply don't sell as much.
[07:24.180 --> 07:26.740]  Scarlet Begonias, that's a Grateful Dead song.
[07:26.740 --> 07:28.260]  I named that after a Grateful Dead song.
[07:28.260 --> 07:30.580]  It doesn't sell as well as some other things.
[07:31.180 --> 07:32.300]  I think it was really missed.
[07:32.300 --> 07:33.260]  I think it was slept on.
[07:33.260 --> 07:34.820]  That one should have been more popular.
[07:34.820 --> 07:38.020]  People didn't buy it, I think, because of the name of the strain.
[07:38.020 --> 07:40.860]  So naming a strain can be difficult.
[07:40.860 --> 07:43.620]  Naming a strain can make or break the strain, in my opinion.
[07:43.620 --> 07:46.980]  Some people, I had a strain called Bounty Killer a long time ago,
[07:46.980 --> 07:48.260]  and a friend of mine didn't want to grow it
[07:48.260 --> 07:49.940]  because she said the name was too aggressive
[07:49.940 --> 07:52.820]  and she didn't want to tell people she was growing Bounty Killer.
[07:52.820 --> 07:55.820]  I named that after a reggae artist named Bounty Killer,
[07:55.820 --> 07:59.060]  and I called it Bounty Killer because it gave me gigantic buds.
[07:59.100 --> 08:00.540]  The Bounty was beautiful.
[08:00.540 --> 08:03.740]  It was a Bounty Killer, also a reggae artist-influenced name.
[08:03.740 --> 08:05.500]  That's where that came from.
[08:05.500 --> 08:07.100]  Anyway, my main point was,
[08:07.100 --> 08:09.300]  thanks for the strain name recommendations.
[08:09.300 --> 08:10.180]  I do appreciate that.
[08:10.180 --> 08:13.860]  I will post more of that stuff to social media, more to the Discord.
[08:13.860 --> 08:17.580]  Also, if I do ask for a strain name recommendations
[08:17.580 --> 08:20.460]  and I can find the person who gave me the name that I use,
[08:20.460 --> 08:22.500]  I will probably send you a pack of seeds.
[08:22.500 --> 08:24.660]  Also, I usually don't do this.
[08:24.660 --> 08:26.660]  This is something I should start doing.
[08:26.660 --> 08:28.500]  I've got a name that was given to me.
[08:28.500 --> 08:29.740]  I posted one cross.
[08:29.740 --> 08:30.940]  I said, hey, I've got this cross.
[08:30.940 --> 08:31.900]  It needs a name.
[08:31.900 --> 08:33.460]  Somebody shouted out a name.
[08:33.460 --> 08:35.860]  I was like, ooh, I'm going to save that for another cross.
[08:35.860 --> 08:37.740]  I'm not going to use it on the one they were talking about,
[08:37.740 --> 08:39.220]  but it did get curbed and shelved.
[08:39.220 --> 08:41.700]  And actually, I think I put it on another one already.
[08:41.700 --> 08:43.700]  If that is now another cross, I know what it's named.
[08:43.700 --> 08:45.700]  That goes on another pack.
[08:45.700 --> 08:46.900]  You'll get points for that also.
[08:46.900 --> 08:49.740]  When I do put that cross out, I'll try to remember who said that.
[08:49.740 --> 08:52.100]  If you remember, I'll send you a pack of those seeds.
[08:52.100 --> 08:53.300]  That makes it super easy.
[08:53.300 --> 08:54.980]  That way people get treated, they get a prize,
[08:54.980 --> 08:57.820]  they get rewarded for their creative content.
[08:57.860 --> 08:59.460]  All right, I'm rambling about strain names,
[08:59.460 --> 09:01.420]  but that's what's been on my brain all day.
[09:01.420 --> 09:02.780]  I've been trying to name a few things.
[09:02.780 --> 09:04.540]  I've got a lot of great fun stuff coming out.
[09:04.540 --> 09:06.020]  Make sure you join the Discord.
[09:06.020 --> 09:07.740]  That's where they see it first.
[09:07.740 --> 09:09.340]  All right, I did say I was going to read an email
[09:09.340 --> 09:10.300]  about stretchy plants.
[09:10.300 --> 09:12.700]  I don't want to ramble too long, maybe too late for that.
[09:12.700 --> 09:14.060]  If you notice me playing with the microphone,
[09:14.060 --> 09:14.700]  it did wobble here.
[09:14.700 --> 09:16.420]  I apologize if I look distracted.
[09:16.420 --> 09:18.980]  Might be time to replace this mic or mic stand.
[09:18.980 --> 09:20.980]  Anyway, let's get right to this email here.
[09:20.980 --> 09:23.700]  This one came from our friend.
[09:23.700 --> 09:25.740]  It does not have a name on it,
[09:25.740 --> 09:27.020]  so we're not going to say their name.
[09:27.020 --> 09:28.740]  It goes a lot like this.
[09:28.740 --> 09:31.180]  It says, what am I doing that makes my plants
[09:31.180 --> 09:32.700]  stretch so much?
[09:32.700 --> 09:35.180]  That is a common problem, a common issue.
[09:35.180 --> 09:36.220]  It could be a lot of things.
[09:36.220 --> 09:38.980]  We'll diagnose that here based on the evidence we are given.
[09:38.980 --> 09:42.900]  It says, they seem to grow the most in week three for me.
[09:42.900 --> 09:44.500]  Yeah, that is very common.
[09:44.500 --> 09:46.500]  When you put your plants into flower,
[09:46.500 --> 09:48.220]  I call it the 21-day stretch.
[09:48.220 --> 09:50.660]  The first three weeks, they're really going to take off.
[09:50.660 --> 09:52.540]  Then about the start of week four,
[09:52.540 --> 09:54.780]  they kind of calm down and start building buds.
[09:54.780 --> 09:56.180]  They're just trying to develop space.
[09:56.180 --> 09:57.460]  They're getting going.
[09:57.460 --> 09:58.680]  That is a very common thing,
[09:58.680 --> 10:01.060]  but there are things we can do to prevent that,
[10:01.060 --> 10:03.740]  to minimize that, and to keep you on track
[10:03.740 --> 10:06.340]  from growing those plants up into the freaking lights.
[10:06.340 --> 10:10.060]  It says, I start them day one at 10 to 12 inches tall,
[10:10.060 --> 10:14.340]  and they always end up around 36 inches or sometimes taller.
[10:14.340 --> 10:16.360]  This is week four.
[10:16.360 --> 10:17.460]  My photos are taken today.
[10:17.460 --> 10:18.740]  He did include a couple of photos,
[10:18.740 --> 10:21.060]  or they did include a couple of photos.
[10:21.060 --> 10:25.840]  It says, I kept the 600-watt HPS 18 inches from the canopy
[10:26.540 --> 10:27.600]  to try and keep the plant short,
[10:27.600 --> 10:30.760]  but it made the outside edges stretch worse, I think.
[10:30.760 --> 10:31.940]  Yes, by looking at the photo,
[10:31.940 --> 10:34.220]  I would agree that the plants on the outer edge
[10:34.220 --> 10:35.680]  of this room did stretch worse.
[10:35.680 --> 10:38.080]  They did not stay compact like you would have hoped,
[10:38.080 --> 10:38.940]  and I know why.
[10:38.940 --> 10:39.820]  We'll talk about that.
[10:39.820 --> 10:41.580]  It says, it is a seed run.
[10:41.580 --> 10:43.760]  That may account for some variation,
[10:43.760 --> 10:47.800]  but it's wedding cake, not a tall plant by any means.
[10:47.800 --> 10:50.640]  So you say right here that you did raise
[10:50.640 --> 10:53.120]  the light from the canopy.
[10:53.120 --> 10:54.160]  That is why they're stretching.
[10:54.160 --> 10:56.340]  That is not enough light for that amount of space.
[10:56.340 --> 10:57.480]  They would prefer more light.
[10:57.480 --> 10:59.160]  If you had 1,000 watt in there,
[10:59.160 --> 11:02.840]  or maybe even an LED light with the appropriate spectrum,
[11:02.840 --> 11:04.440]  they would not stretch as much.
[11:04.440 --> 11:06.520]  So a lot of the issue is light.
[11:06.520 --> 11:07.940]  They want more light.
[11:07.940 --> 11:09.600]  I see that you have got the kind of light
[11:09.600 --> 11:11.600]  that has got the wing that you can bend and flex.
[11:11.600 --> 11:14.540]  You've got it bent down to create a very tight arc
[11:14.540 --> 11:15.400]  from that shield.
[11:15.400 --> 11:18.440]  That is a reflector, is what that piece is called.
[11:18.440 --> 11:20.160]  The umbrella piece that is making the light
[11:20.160 --> 11:22.600]  stay inside of that reflector and reflect around,
[11:22.600 --> 11:25.160]  if you can bend that out more and spread that out
[11:25.160 --> 11:26.880]  to get the light, you'll watch it happen.
[11:26.880 --> 11:28.940]  As you lift the sides of those wings up,
[11:28.940 --> 11:30.600]  the light will come out to the side more,
[11:30.600 --> 11:33.000]  and those plants on the side will receive more light.
[11:33.000 --> 11:34.360]  That will be the first thing I would do.
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.960]  Then I would lower that light.
[11:35.960 --> 11:38.720]  I would start with lowering it about six inches,
[11:38.720 --> 11:41.060]  and if it didn't do anything good, I'd go about six more.
[11:41.060 --> 11:43.040]  I'd watch until those plants start to look like
[11:43.040 --> 11:45.400]  they're almost mad, then I'd go up a little bit.
[11:45.400 --> 11:47.720]  But I'd drop it down six inches right away.
[11:47.720 --> 11:49.320]  So spread that wing a little bit,
[11:49.320 --> 11:50.840]  drop the plants down six inches.
[11:50.840 --> 11:52.360]  Now you're gonna spread that light more,
[11:53.120 --> 11:54.240]  and you're gonna penetrate a little more deeper
[11:54.240 --> 11:55.440]  into that canopy.
[11:55.440 --> 11:56.840]  The main problem is those lights,
[11:56.840 --> 11:58.440]  those plants are not getting enough light.
[11:58.440 --> 12:02.120]  That is the main issue about those plants that I can see.
[12:03.660 --> 12:05.520]  Now, basically plants are gonna stretch.
[12:05.520 --> 12:06.840]  That is what's going to happen.
[12:06.840 --> 12:09.340]  You can minimize that by giving them more light.
[12:09.340 --> 12:11.920]  You can minimize that by using a trellis net
[12:11.920 --> 12:13.860]  to hold them down, pull them down.
[12:13.860 --> 12:15.220]  You can use a tomato cage.
[12:15.220 --> 12:16.520]  You could pull them into the tomato cage
[12:16.520 --> 12:17.520]  and spread them underneath there,
[12:17.520 --> 12:18.360]  and then when they grow up,
[12:18.360 --> 12:20.160]  you pull them under the next level of the tomato cage,
[12:20.160 --> 12:21.720]  kind of weave them in.
[12:21.720 --> 12:24.360]  You could drill holes in the top of your buckets,
[12:24.360 --> 12:26.880]  and you could put a string on the branch,
[12:26.880 --> 12:27.760]  and you could pull it down
[12:27.760 --> 12:29.240]  and then tie it to the bottom of the bucket.
[12:29.240 --> 12:30.680]  I've seen that done.
[12:30.680 --> 12:34.840]  Now people are making 3D printed plant light stress
[12:34.840 --> 12:37.080]  or low stress technique clips.
[12:37.080 --> 12:38.760]  So you basically pop the plant a little bit
[12:38.760 --> 12:39.680]  and put this clip on it,
[12:39.680 --> 12:42.280]  and it will hold the plant at a 90 degree or a 45 degree.
[12:42.280 --> 12:44.020]  They sell a couple of different styles.
[12:44.020 --> 12:46.100]  It'll just bend that plant right over for you.
[12:46.100 --> 12:47.600]  The plant will start to grow horizontal.
[12:47.600 --> 12:49.760]  Over a couple of days, it'll go straight back up.
[12:49.760 --> 12:51.560]  Then you grab it a little further down and do it again.
[12:52.400 --> 12:53.920]  You can manipulate the plants to keep them low.
[12:53.920 --> 12:55.440]  That is something that you'll have to learn to do
[12:55.440 --> 12:56.480]  as a gardener.
[12:56.480 --> 12:59.460]  Once you find the phenotype which you want to work with,
[12:59.460 --> 13:01.440]  that's another thing that I do want to talk about
[13:01.440 --> 13:02.960]  here in this room.
[13:02.960 --> 13:04.000]  We'll get to that.
[13:04.000 --> 13:05.080]  Another thing we could do,
[13:05.080 --> 13:07.300]  we can pop and twist these plants a little bit.
[13:07.300 --> 13:08.940]  Something I really like to do
[13:08.940 --> 13:11.000]  as soon as I put the plants in flower, day one,
[13:11.000 --> 13:12.440]  I move them to the flower room,
[13:12.440 --> 13:13.960]  clean up the legs, do a lollipop,
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.200]  do a little defoliation, do a little shaving the legs.
[13:17.200 --> 13:19.080]  Some popping and twisting is the next thing I do.
[13:19.080 --> 13:20.560]  I talk about this a lot.
[13:20.560 --> 13:22.560]  I simply grab the plant with two hands
[13:22.560 --> 13:24.120]  and I twist different directions
[13:24.120 --> 13:25.880]  to where you achieve like a knuckle popping sound.
[13:25.880 --> 13:27.000]  I'll do it.
[13:27.000 --> 13:28.440]  I don't have any knuckles to pop.
[13:28.440 --> 13:29.280]  There we go.
[13:29.280 --> 13:30.520]  You'll get that sort of a sound.
[13:30.520 --> 13:31.880]  When the plants make that sort of sound,
[13:31.880 --> 13:34.600]  you have now broken the cellulose fiber of that plant.
[13:34.600 --> 13:35.700]  Don't bend it sideways.
[13:35.700 --> 13:36.540]  Don't bend it over.
[13:36.540 --> 13:38.320]  Just twist it and you'll pop it.
[13:38.320 --> 13:39.600]  Now what's gonna happen is that plant
[13:39.600 --> 13:41.460]  is going to spend a lot of its energy
[13:41.460 --> 13:44.100]  refocusing on that little popped and twisted part.
[13:44.100 --> 13:44.940]  It's gonna heal that.
[13:44.940 --> 13:48.140]  It's gonna make a knuckle, a knurled spot, if you will.
[13:48.140 --> 13:49.740]  That little section will be stronger
[13:49.740 --> 13:51.460]  than it ever was before.
[13:51.460 --> 13:53.500]  Also, it's going to support the buds
[13:53.500 --> 13:54.940]  better than it would have without that.
[13:54.940 --> 13:55.940]  But also what you're doing,
[13:55.940 --> 13:57.580]  you're slowing down the stretch
[13:57.580 --> 13:59.620]  because now the plant is spending energy
[13:59.620 --> 14:01.500]  repairing all of those pops and twists.
[14:01.500 --> 14:02.380]  Because I'm gonna do it,
[14:02.380 --> 14:03.620]  I'm gonna start at the main stalk.
[14:03.620 --> 14:05.360]  I'm gonna go all the way up the main stalk.
[14:05.360 --> 14:07.000]  Then I'm gonna go each branch all the way up
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.500]  and pop and twist as much as I possibly can
[14:09.500 --> 14:12.660]  and cause a lot of, it's low stress training to this plant
[14:12.660 --> 14:14.260]  just by popping and twisting it.
[14:14.260 --> 14:16.680]  Now it's gonna spend a lot of energy repairing
[14:16.680 --> 14:18.720]  and recouping all the damage that we just did
[14:18.720 --> 14:19.760]  instead of growing tall.
[14:19.760 --> 14:21.680]  It's gonna just go, I can't grow tall.
[14:21.680 --> 14:24.480]  I gotta fix all my broken arms and my broken knuckles.
[14:24.480 --> 14:26.520]  We didn't do a lot of serious damage to the plant,
[14:26.520 --> 14:28.880]  but we did enough to refocus the energy
[14:28.880 --> 14:31.160]  on repairing instead of growing tall.
[14:31.160 --> 14:33.800]  Now we're not going to damage any buds, any weed,
[14:33.800 --> 14:34.960]  any flower development
[14:34.960 --> 14:36.800]  because that's not even happening yet.
[14:36.800 --> 14:38.420]  The plants are still transitioning
[14:38.420 --> 14:39.960]  into their flowering hormones.
[14:39.960 --> 14:42.320]  That's why they're starting to take off so rapidly.
[14:42.320 --> 14:44.240]  There are nutrients we can feed our plants
[14:44.240 --> 14:45.680]  which will mitigate that stretch.
[14:45.680 --> 14:47.600]  Maybe if you reduce the nitrogen
[14:47.600 --> 14:49.320]  that will slow down that stretch.
[14:49.320 --> 14:52.200]  I like to give my plants shine right at the start of flower
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.000]  and I noticed that that does reduce the stretch a little bit
[14:55.000 --> 14:56.060]  there are a lot of products out there
[14:56.060 --> 14:58.040]  that will claim to reduce stretch.
[14:58.040 --> 14:59.560]  Do some reading, do some research,
[14:59.560 --> 15:03.660]  but the main thing I would think about is
[15:03.660 --> 15:06.840]  this is plant and phenotype specific.
[15:06.840 --> 15:08.840]  This is your first run with these plants.
[15:08.840 --> 15:10.720]  These came from seed.
[15:10.720 --> 15:13.240]  I would have flowered these much sooner.
[15:13.240 --> 15:15.480]  I've seen your grow space and it is a little packed in there.
[15:15.480 --> 15:16.840]  The plants are a little stretched out.
[15:16.840 --> 15:18.320]  They're a little tall.
[15:18.320 --> 15:21.320]  And we don't even know if we've got males or females
[15:21.320 --> 15:25.120]  or intersex plants or mutants or keepers at this point.
[15:25.120 --> 15:27.480]  And you've been vegging for at least 30,
[15:27.480 --> 15:30.760]  probably 45 days based on the photos that I've seen.
[15:30.760 --> 15:32.880]  So you're already 45 days into these plants
[15:32.880 --> 15:34.560]  and we don't know if they're gonna be keepers.
[15:34.560 --> 15:37.380]  We don't know if they're total trash or if they're gold.
[15:37.380 --> 15:39.580]  They could be either or you said you have got some,
[15:39.580 --> 15:41.000]  I think you said wedding cake
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.720]  that could turn out to be a hundred percent intersex plants
[15:43.720 --> 15:46.080]  or that could turn out to be hot, hot fire.
[15:46.080 --> 15:47.160]  I'm not sure what you've got.
[15:47.160 --> 15:48.320]  Either are you.
[15:48.320 --> 15:50.040]  We don't know until you flower them out,
[15:50.040 --> 15:51.400]  finish them, dry them, cure them,
[15:51.400 --> 15:54.180]  smoke them and approve them or reject them.
[15:54.180 --> 15:57.040]  So what I would have done is I would have grown these
[15:57.040 --> 16:01.080]  much, much smaller and then flowered them much earlier.
[16:01.080 --> 16:03.620]  My plants would have been about the size of your plants
[16:03.620 --> 16:04.860]  when they are finished.
[16:04.860 --> 16:08.800]  My test run of plants would be as big as yours are now
[16:08.800 --> 16:09.640]  when they are done.
[16:09.640 --> 16:11.080]  I would be done already.
[16:11.080 --> 16:12.600]  Those would have been into flower.
[16:12.600 --> 16:13.520]  I would have sexed them.
[16:13.520 --> 16:15.000]  I would have pulled out the males.
[16:15.120 --> 16:16.600]  I would have had them finished already.
[16:16.600 --> 16:18.400]  We'd be drying, curing them and smoking them
[16:18.400 --> 16:19.620]  while you're still vegging.
[16:19.620 --> 16:21.480]  Not really, you're only like 45 days in,
[16:21.480 --> 16:23.920]  but I'd already be a few days into flower
[16:23.920 --> 16:25.440]  with plants that are brand new.
[16:25.440 --> 16:28.440]  I wouldn't spend that much time, lights, energy,
[16:28.440 --> 16:31.240]  electricity, water, soil, nutrients, space.
[16:31.240 --> 16:32.600]  I wouldn't have given them all of that
[16:32.600 --> 16:34.440]  without knowing if they were keeper plants.
[16:34.440 --> 16:37.500]  So one of the things I would have done,
[16:37.500 --> 16:39.400]  I would have put those plants into small pots
[16:39.400 --> 16:40.400]  and I would have grown them out
[16:40.400 --> 16:42.280]  until they were six or eight inches tall.
[16:42.280 --> 16:43.720]  Then I would have put them into flower
[16:43.720 --> 16:45.640]  until I can identify the males and females.
[16:45.640 --> 16:48.100]  I would have pulled the males out of the room immediately.
[16:48.100 --> 16:49.260]  Then you have a decision to make.
[16:49.260 --> 16:51.840]  Do you want to reveg or do you want to cut clones?
[16:51.840 --> 16:52.680]  I would get a clone
[16:52.680 --> 16:54.680]  or I would dedicate to reveging at this time.
[16:54.680 --> 16:56.480]  Right now I'm limited on numbers.
[16:56.480 --> 16:58.200]  I would go with the revege situation.
[16:58.200 --> 16:59.580]  So we just move forward.
[16:59.580 --> 17:01.840]  You can either keep flowering these plants
[17:01.840 --> 17:04.440]  or you can veg them until they get a little bit bigger
[17:04.440 --> 17:05.400]  and then flower them out.
[17:05.400 --> 17:07.520]  But once those boys are out of the room,
[17:07.520 --> 17:10.240]  at this point I would probably just keep flowering.
[17:10.240 --> 17:11.380]  Keep flowering them out,
[17:11.380 --> 17:13.860]  then find the good females out of that batch.
[17:13.860 --> 17:15.380]  There's gonna be a shitty one.
[17:15.380 --> 17:16.900]  There's gonna be an amazing one.
[17:16.900 --> 17:18.140]  There's gonna be one that tastes good.
[17:18.140 --> 17:19.800]  There's gonna be one that harvests heavy.
[17:19.800 --> 17:21.540]  You've got to find the plant out of that batch
[17:21.540 --> 17:23.400]  that works best for you.
[17:23.400 --> 17:25.260]  Do you want that tall, stretchy phenotype?
[17:25.260 --> 17:27.300]  Do you want that short squat phenotype?
[17:27.300 --> 17:29.220]  Do you want the one that makes the super dense buds
[17:29.220 --> 17:30.060]  and tastes real good?
[17:30.060 --> 17:31.780]  Do you want the one that makes a little fluffier buds
[17:31.780 --> 17:33.240]  but gets you super high?
[17:33.240 --> 17:34.740]  There's gonna be different phenotypes
[17:34.740 --> 17:36.020]  to select for in there.
[17:36.020 --> 17:37.460]  And I would have done the pheno hunt
[17:37.460 --> 17:40.280]  before I did the big dedicated grow,
[17:40.280 --> 17:42.080]  which is kind of what it looks like you did.
[17:42.080 --> 17:44.120]  Then we could have found out, does this one get tall?
[17:44.120 --> 17:45.000]  Does it get stretchy?
[17:45.000 --> 17:46.120]  What does it do?
[17:46.120 --> 17:47.600]  Then you can dial in your environment
[17:47.600 --> 17:48.600]  for the specific plant.
[17:48.600 --> 17:50.260]  Right now you got a big jungle.
[17:50.260 --> 17:51.680]  Some plants are 18 inches tall.
[17:51.680 --> 17:53.360]  Some are 36 inches tall.
[17:53.360 --> 17:54.960]  By the time you get midway through flower,
[17:54.960 --> 17:56.080]  some are gonna be touching the light.
[17:56.080 --> 17:58.080]  You're gonna have to get some and bend them down.
[17:58.080 --> 17:59.600]  You're gonna have a lot of work to do.
[17:59.600 --> 18:01.660]  So in the future, I would recommend flowering
[18:01.660 --> 18:03.400]  smaller test plants.
[18:03.400 --> 18:05.400]  Don't waste a lot of time, space, energy, money,
[18:05.400 --> 18:07.600]  and investment on something you don't know
[18:07.600 --> 18:08.580]  is going to pay off.
[18:08.620 --> 18:11.500]  The return on investment is very important,
[18:11.500 --> 18:14.100]  especially nowadays that cannabis is losing value.
[18:14.100 --> 18:15.340]  Electricity is going up.
[18:15.340 --> 18:16.540]  Everything costs more.
[18:16.540 --> 18:18.020]  We've got to pay more attention
[18:18.020 --> 18:19.740]  to the return on investment.
[18:19.740 --> 18:21.780]  So I think the thing to take away from this piece
[18:21.780 --> 18:23.980]  is to set yourself up for success
[18:23.980 --> 18:26.220]  before you fill that room or even your outdoor.
[18:26.220 --> 18:27.560]  This does apply to outdoors.
[18:27.560 --> 18:30.620]  I've done a full episode on this, on outdoor growing.
[18:30.620 --> 18:32.440]  Before you fill your room with giant plants
[18:32.440 --> 18:35.100]  and grow them real big and give them a lot of time and love,
[18:35.100 --> 18:36.400]  let's find out, are they males?
[18:36.400 --> 18:37.240]  Are they females?
[18:37.240 --> 18:38.060]  Are they intersex?
[18:38.580 --> 18:39.420]  Are they mutants?
[18:39.420 --> 18:41.020]  Or do you have the plant that you want to work with?
[18:41.020 --> 18:42.660]  Let's do a proper pheno hunt.
[18:42.660 --> 18:44.060]  Let's find the plants we need.
[18:44.060 --> 18:46.180]  Then let's repeatedly grow those.
[18:46.180 --> 18:47.840]  Let's be real careful this year
[18:47.840 --> 18:50.420]  not to put male plants outdoors
[18:50.420 --> 18:51.700]  and ruin other people's gardens.
[18:51.700 --> 18:54.180]  Let's be real careful not to put intersex plants
[18:54.180 --> 18:56.940]  outdoors this year and ruin other people's gardens.
[18:56.940 --> 18:58.040]  Let's be more selective.
[18:58.040 --> 18:58.980]  Let's be more careful.
[18:58.980 --> 19:00.540]  Let's put plants outdoors
[19:00.540 --> 19:02.820]  that we're going to enjoy smoking all season
[19:02.820 --> 19:03.720]  because if you do it right,
[19:03.720 --> 19:05.180]  you're gonna grow a bunch of it.
[19:05.180 --> 19:06.920]  Let's not put some B-grade shit out there
[19:06.920 --> 19:08.400]  that somebody else selected
[19:08.400 --> 19:10.080]  that they didn't really want that they gave to you
[19:10.080 --> 19:11.740]  because it was extras in their grow.
[19:11.740 --> 19:13.120]  Let's put some good shit out there.
[19:13.120 --> 19:14.440]  Let's be more selective.
[19:14.440 --> 19:15.480]  Let's pay attention.
[19:15.480 --> 19:17.960]  Set yourself up for success.
[19:17.960 --> 19:20.600]  If you have the option to run that seed indoors
[19:20.600 --> 19:22.480]  and find if it's a male or a female,
[19:22.480 --> 19:24.200]  find the keepers, find the best plants.
[19:24.200 --> 19:25.640]  That is the ideal way to do it.
[19:25.640 --> 19:28.600]  The first time you run these plants is just the first day.
[19:28.600 --> 19:32.120]  Don't expect the amazing outcome from the first day.
[19:32.120 --> 19:33.440]  That's not gonna be a cash crop.
[19:33.440 --> 19:35.160]  That's not gonna be a profitable crop.
[19:35.160 --> 19:37.400]  You can definitely, you'll have medicine,
[19:37.400 --> 19:39.400]  you'll have product from that first run,
[19:39.400 --> 19:41.960]  but this is your inaugural test crop.
[19:41.960 --> 19:44.560]  This is how a farmer finds the plant that works for them.
[19:44.560 --> 19:47.140]  The first one is an audition, the casting couch.
[19:47.140 --> 19:48.140]  This is Tinder.
[19:48.140 --> 19:49.280]  This is your swiping right now.
[19:49.280 --> 19:50.680]  You gotta go on that first date.
[19:50.680 --> 19:51.880]  You gotta find the one you like.
[19:51.880 --> 19:53.440]  Then pamper that one
[19:53.440 --> 19:55.960]  once you find the one that works best for you.
[19:55.960 --> 19:58.640]  All right, I think I've made my point on that part.
[19:58.640 --> 20:00.440]  Don't put some random seed or clone outdoors.
[20:00.440 --> 20:01.280]  It could be a male.
[20:01.280 --> 20:02.440]  It could be trash.
[20:02.440 --> 20:03.400]  Don't waste your time.
[20:03.400 --> 20:07.080]  Don't ruin yours or your neighbor's garden.
[20:07.080 --> 20:08.460]  My friend that sent me this message,
[20:08.460 --> 20:10.960]  I hope I did help answer some of your questions.
[20:10.960 --> 20:12.160]  I would spread that wing up.
[20:12.160 --> 20:13.400]  I would lower the light.
[20:13.400 --> 20:15.360]  Then I would probably start popping and twisting
[20:15.360 --> 20:17.160]  and bending those plants down now
[20:17.160 --> 20:18.000]  because in the future,
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.320]  they are definitely going to get way out of control.
[20:21.320 --> 20:23.220]  If you're looking for the keeper out of that pack,
[20:23.220 --> 20:26.360]  I don't know that this run was an official solid test run
[20:26.360 --> 20:28.120]  because some of those plants are super stretchy
[20:28.120 --> 20:30.640]  because of their location in the room.
[20:30.640 --> 20:33.380]  Next time, maybe rotate the plants around a little bit
[20:34.220 --> 20:35.460]  so that you get some on the edge, some in the middle,
[20:35.460 --> 20:36.420]  and then just move them.
[20:36.420 --> 20:38.620]  Just do like a rotation so they all get
[20:38.620 --> 20:40.100]  a little bit of that prime light
[20:40.100 --> 20:41.840]  and then they all spend a day in the weak light.
[20:41.840 --> 20:42.820]  Just move them around.
[20:42.820 --> 20:45.080]  That way you don't get super stretchy, super squat plants
[20:45.080 --> 20:46.860]  all in the same room.
[20:46.860 --> 20:48.660]  My dude, thank you for the great question.
[20:48.660 --> 20:49.780]  I do appreciate it.
[20:49.780 --> 20:51.320]  If you have any more follow-up questions,
[20:51.320 --> 20:52.820]  you do have the email address.
[20:52.820 --> 20:54.980]  Everybody else out there, the email address, of course,
[20:54.980 --> 20:58.000]  is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[20:58.000 --> 20:58.840]  Don't be shy.
[20:58.840 --> 21:01.340]  Send me your grow questions, your constructive criticism,
[21:01.340 --> 21:03.740]  your positive feedback.
[21:03.740 --> 21:04.580]  It's getting hard to talk.
[21:04.580 --> 21:05.680]  I better keep moving.
[21:05.680 --> 21:10.680]  Let's jump into this next email here for this episode.
[21:11.100 --> 21:13.620]  All right, this next question comes from our friend Seth.
[21:13.620 --> 21:15.220]  Big shout out to my buddy Seth.
[21:15.220 --> 21:17.620]  The question goes a lot like this.
[21:17.620 --> 21:19.700]  It says, hey, Ross DeJeff, how are you?
[21:19.700 --> 21:20.540]  I am great, bro.
[21:20.540 --> 21:21.700]  Thank you for asking.
[21:21.700 --> 21:22.900]  I'm doing pretty well.
[21:22.900 --> 21:23.740]  Nice and stoned.
[21:23.740 --> 21:25.420]  I smoked some, should I even talk about that?
[21:25.420 --> 21:28.260]  I had some machine live batter from some friends
[21:28.260 --> 21:29.840]  and we can't even talk about where they are
[21:29.840 --> 21:31.640]  because then you guys will bother them
[21:31.640 --> 21:32.880]  and they would like to remain anonymous.
[21:32.880 --> 21:36.440]  I smoked some machine live batter and I'm feeling great.
[21:36.440 --> 21:37.280]  Thanks for asking.
[21:37.280 --> 21:38.520]  It says, I hope all is well
[21:38.520 --> 21:40.440]  and I thank you for all that you do.
[21:40.440 --> 21:43.320]  Everything is irie, bro, and thank you for checking on me.
[21:43.320 --> 21:44.760]  It says, at one point in my life,
[21:44.760 --> 21:46.560]  I was a high school biology teacher
[21:46.560 --> 21:49.420]  and while teaching things like mandolin genetics
[21:49.420 --> 21:53.000]  and plant biology, I would always try to tell my students,
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.580]  pay attention now because it's free.
[21:55.580 --> 21:57.200]  If you wait till later in life,
[21:57.200 --> 22:00.680]  someone will make you pay for this type of information.
[22:00.680 --> 22:02.420]  Most of the time that is true, but it goes on.
[22:02.420 --> 22:04.800]  It says, thank you for proving me wrong.
[22:04.800 --> 22:07.640]  I love how you are providing all of this free knowledge
[22:07.640 --> 22:09.560]  so that we can all learn from our hearts.
[22:09.560 --> 22:10.400]  I appreciate that.
[22:10.400 --> 22:11.920]  Thank you for noticing.
[22:11.920 --> 22:13.640]  I do try to keep the show free.
[22:13.640 --> 22:15.520]  Of course, there is the Patreon
[22:15.520 --> 22:17.580]  to where if people do wanna contribute, they can.
[22:17.580 --> 22:19.080]  So I do appreciate you noticing,
[22:19.080 --> 22:20.960]  but I do put all of this content out here
[22:20.960 --> 22:23.280]  without charging you a penny for it.
[22:23.280 --> 22:24.120]  All right, it does go on.
[22:24.120 --> 22:26.120]  It says, I have a grow question, which is great
[22:26.120 --> 22:28.360]  because that's what I am here for.
[22:28.360 --> 22:31.120]  It says, I currently grow organically in soil
[22:31.120 --> 22:33.520]  with an HLG 600 R-spec.
[22:33.520 --> 22:35.520]  And then it talks about the grow a little bit.
[22:35.520 --> 22:37.640]  It says, I'm finishing a run of strawberry glue
[22:37.640 --> 22:40.280]  from TH seeds, which is a seven to eight week
[22:40.280 --> 22:42.800]  flowering strain that I had planned on taking out
[22:42.800 --> 22:45.000]  the full eight weeks, which would mean
[22:45.000 --> 22:46.800]  harvest is in two days.
[22:46.800 --> 22:47.900]  All right, it goes on.
[22:47.900 --> 22:49.520]  It says, I heard on your podcast
[22:49.520 --> 22:51.760]  that for the last seven to 10 days,
[22:51.760 --> 22:54.280]  you switched back to an 18-6 light cycle
[22:54.280 --> 22:56.160]  and I've decided to give that a try.
[22:56.160 --> 22:58.840]  Yes, many people have said that I'm completely crazy
[22:58.840 --> 23:01.680]  for doing so, but the people that have tried this
[23:01.680 --> 23:03.360]  have given me great praise.
[23:03.360 --> 23:06.180]  When I am finishing my plants, when I'm flushing,
[23:06.180 --> 23:09.920]  I turn my lights back to 18 hours on and six hours off.
[23:09.920 --> 23:12.720]  Yes, that is not normally what people do,
[23:12.720 --> 23:13.920]  but I get great results.
[23:13.920 --> 23:16.280]  I notice my plants get beefier and chunkier
[23:16.280 --> 23:18.120]  and they finish a little more quickly.
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.120]  So that is something I've implemented it into my grow.
[23:21.120 --> 23:23.740]  I do not do this on the very first run.
[23:24.180 --> 23:25.300]  I do this after I know the plants,
[23:25.300 --> 23:27.100]  after I know how long they flower,
[23:27.100 --> 23:28.580]  how long I need to flush them.
[23:28.580 --> 23:30.660]  When they are done, that is when I start doing
[23:30.660 --> 23:32.240]  cool, fancy shit to them.
[23:32.240 --> 23:34.340]  Not on the first run, keep that in mind.
[23:34.340 --> 23:35.980]  So let's keep going.
[23:35.980 --> 23:37.740]  There's more, it says.
[23:37.740 --> 23:39.780]  The problem is that in two days,
[23:39.780 --> 23:41.940]  I don't think the trichomes will be ready.
[23:41.940 --> 23:43.060]  I thought they would have been ready,
[23:43.060 --> 23:46.340]  but this morning they're probably only two to 5% amber
[23:46.340 --> 23:50.060]  and mostly cloudy, but some trichomes are even still clear.
[23:50.060 --> 23:52.540]  That is, they will speed up quite quickly.
[23:52.540 --> 23:55.460]  They'll never be completely even, completely the same.
[23:55.460 --> 23:57.940]  It says, I feel I definitely have to take
[23:57.940 --> 24:01.140]  the 18-6 light cycle out to the full 10 days,
[24:01.140 --> 24:03.980]  which would be a Tuesday harvest date.
[24:03.980 --> 24:06.940]  My concern, all right, this is where we get to the concerns,
[24:06.940 --> 24:09.820]  is that what if the trichomes are not ready on Tuesday,
[24:09.820 --> 24:11.540]  which would be the full 10 days
[24:11.540 --> 24:13.900]  of switching back to the 18-6?
[24:13.900 --> 24:16.740]  I think you'll be just fine going 14 full days
[24:16.740 --> 24:18.500]  with the 18-6 light cycle,
[24:18.500 --> 24:20.540]  maybe even up to 17 days I've gone
[24:20.540 --> 24:22.420]  and have not had problems.
[24:23.300 --> 24:25.380]  This is why I say two things.
[24:26.500 --> 24:29.740]  Always plan to go longer on your inaugural run
[24:29.740 --> 24:31.140]  with the pack of seeds.
[24:31.140 --> 24:32.980]  When you said at the beginning that this was supposed
[24:32.980 --> 24:36.060]  to be a seven to eight week flowering cycle strain,
[24:36.060 --> 24:38.020]  I was already skeptical.
[24:38.020 --> 24:40.020]  I would already plan to go nine weeks with that.
[24:40.020 --> 24:41.500]  I definitely wouldn't go eight weeks.
[24:41.500 --> 24:43.380]  I would go nine just to see.
[24:43.380 --> 24:45.340]  Then the other thing that I would definitely not do
[24:45.340 --> 24:47.340]  is do the 18-6 on the first run
[24:47.340 --> 24:49.860]  so that you don't run into this type of issue
[24:49.860 --> 24:50.700]  if you would have ran it.
[24:50.740 --> 24:52.460]  And I'm not trying to criticize you
[24:52.460 --> 24:53.340]  or scold you or anything.
[24:53.340 --> 24:55.100]  I'm just saying, if we would have done a run
[24:55.100 --> 24:56.860]  with these plants first, we would have known
[24:56.860 --> 24:58.820]  they definitely don't finish in eight weeks.
[24:58.820 --> 25:01.460]  Then we would have known not to start the timer too early.
[25:01.460 --> 25:02.780]  So then we would have figured that out.
[25:02.780 --> 25:05.340]  But I don't think you're gonna have too much of a problem.
[25:05.340 --> 25:06.780]  They're going to finish up on time.
[25:06.780 --> 25:08.140]  You've still got a couple of days to go.
[25:08.140 --> 25:10.860]  Plus you've got a couple of added extra days.
[25:10.860 --> 25:12.560]  Always go longer, in my opinion,
[25:12.560 --> 25:15.460]  than the original breeders recommended time.
[25:15.460 --> 25:18.060]  Go five, 10, a few extra days
[25:18.060 --> 25:19.500]  just to see what the plants might do.
[25:19.500 --> 25:20.860]  You don't even know what they would do
[25:20.860 --> 25:22.940]  if you don't go that extra time.
[25:22.940 --> 25:24.420]  They're definitely not gonna be done
[25:24.420 --> 25:26.180]  if you would have done the light cycle,
[25:26.180 --> 25:27.980]  the regular cycle with the breeder recommended.
[25:27.980 --> 25:30.140]  So your concern is that the trichomes
[25:30.140 --> 25:31.180]  are not ready on Tuesday,
[25:31.180 --> 25:33.340]  which would be 10 full days of switching back
[25:33.340 --> 25:34.800]  to the 18-6 light cycle.
[25:34.800 --> 25:36.820]  If I let the plants go even longer
[25:36.820 --> 25:39.300]  to get 20 to 30% amber trichomes,
[25:39.300 --> 25:42.020]  do I run the risk of revegging these plants?
[25:42.020 --> 25:44.980]  If I have to go longer than 10 days, 18-6,
[25:44.980 --> 25:46.540]  should I switch back to 12-12?
[25:46.540 --> 25:48.980]  No, do not switch back to 12-12.
[25:49.020 --> 25:51.300]  That will freak them out more than anything.
[25:51.300 --> 25:53.300]  You've already given them a hormone shift in the,
[25:53.300 --> 25:55.520]  I said hormone shift, I apologize if you caught that.
[25:55.520 --> 25:56.940]  Both times I said it.
[25:56.940 --> 25:57.900]  You've already confused them.
[25:57.900 --> 25:59.420]  That will just make them even more confused.
[25:59.420 --> 26:00.900]  They'll start doing wonky shit.
[26:00.900 --> 26:03.060]  Leave it on the 18-6.
[26:03.060 --> 26:04.380]  Let them finish out.
[26:04.380 --> 26:06.700]  If you see any signs of reveg,
[26:06.700 --> 26:07.740]  you'll know what it looks like.
[26:07.740 --> 26:09.800]  At the tips of the buds, they'll start doing weird shit.
[26:09.800 --> 26:11.220]  Cut it down right then.
[26:11.220 --> 26:12.660]  Begin flushing now.
[26:12.660 --> 26:14.340]  Be prepared to cut right away.
[26:14.340 --> 26:16.220]  But I think your plants are going to finish up
[26:16.220 --> 26:17.420]  on time in the next few days.
[26:17.420 --> 26:19.300]  You'll notice that over the next few days,
[26:19.300 --> 26:20.460]  they'll just finish up for you.
[26:20.460 --> 26:22.580]  They're done and they're on that light cycle
[26:22.580 --> 26:24.080]  that makes them go more quickly.
[26:24.080 --> 26:24.940]  They will finish up.
[26:24.940 --> 26:28.340]  If you've got to cut down before they're 20-30% amber,
[26:28.340 --> 26:29.440]  that will not be a big deal.
[26:29.440 --> 26:32.360]  You will still have quality, potent smoke.
[26:32.360 --> 26:34.340]  I don't think it's going to ruin the crop for you.
[26:34.340 --> 26:35.700]  So pay attention.
[26:35.700 --> 26:38.580]  See if they start looking like they're revegging.
[26:38.580 --> 26:40.300]  As soon as you see reveg, cut them.
[26:40.300 --> 26:41.860]  Also pay attention to the trichomes.
[26:41.860 --> 26:44.380]  I would go about 15-20% amber.
[26:44.380 --> 26:46.100]  Then I would cut at that point.
[26:46.100 --> 26:49.020]  But I do not think you should switch back to the 12-12.
[26:49.020 --> 26:50.700]  Now there is a second half to this question.
[26:50.700 --> 26:51.540]  It does go on.
[26:51.540 --> 26:54.220]  It says, my next question is about breeding.
[26:54.220 --> 26:55.820]  These are my favorite questions.
[26:55.820 --> 26:58.660]  It says, I'm about to become an amateur pollen chucker
[26:58.660 --> 27:01.720]  and I just germinated four of your firefly seeds
[27:01.720 --> 27:03.460]  with the paper towel method.
[27:03.460 --> 27:05.220]  For the record, I tried to germinate six
[27:05.220 --> 27:08.820]  and all six showed a taproot coming out and I planted them.
[27:08.820 --> 27:11.940]  Talks about that and then 100 germination rate.
[27:11.940 --> 27:12.940]  It looks like a couple of died
[27:12.940 --> 27:14.700]  and I'm not sure why we don't cover that.
[27:14.700 --> 27:16.580]  It says, my plan is to get a cutting
[27:16.580 --> 27:17.940]  of another strain from a friend
[27:17.940 --> 27:19.540]  and cross it with the firefly
[27:19.540 --> 27:22.880]  with the dual goals of making firefly a little bit shorter
[27:22.880 --> 27:25.100]  and to really push the skunk nodes.
[27:25.100 --> 27:26.780]  I know that you always seem to give permission
[27:26.780 --> 27:27.700]  to breed with your gear,
[27:27.700 --> 27:29.780]  but I at least wanted to ask permission
[27:29.780 --> 27:31.760]  and show you respect you deserve.
[27:31.760 --> 27:33.040]  Not to mention, I wanted to make sure
[27:33.040 --> 27:35.260]  that you did not have any plans to do the same cross,
[27:35.260 --> 27:37.860]  being that you are a professional and this is your business
[27:37.860 --> 27:39.860]  and I'm doing it for fun.
[27:39.860 --> 27:42.540]  Dude, you have got my full blessing.
[27:42.540 --> 27:44.080]  Everybody out there, if you're listening
[27:44.520 --> 27:46.520]  or watching or if somebody's reading this to you
[27:46.520 --> 27:49.240]  or whatever, you've got my full permission
[27:49.240 --> 27:51.400]  to breed with my seeds and my strains.
[27:51.400 --> 27:54.040]  I did not invent cannabis, I don't own weed,
[27:54.040 --> 27:56.380]  I don't have a copyright on seed breeding.
[27:56.380 --> 27:58.320]  That is not me, that's not my way.
[27:58.320 --> 28:00.840]  I make seeds just like all the other breeders make seeds,
[28:00.840 --> 28:02.640]  just like you're gonna make seeds.
[28:02.640 --> 28:05.920]  I didn't sneeze some seeds out of my ass one day
[28:05.920 --> 28:07.060]  and create a strain.
[28:07.060 --> 28:08.800]  I had to get seeds from other breeders.
[28:08.800 --> 28:10.860]  You see me honor the breeders that I work with.
[28:10.860 --> 28:12.200]  That's all that I ask you to do
[28:12.200 --> 28:13.500]  when you do breed with my stuff.
[28:13.940 --> 28:16.300]  If you post a picture, say this was whatever
[28:16.300 --> 28:18.540]  across to Rasta Jeff's Firefly or Firefly
[28:18.540 --> 28:20.340]  across to whatever, give me some credit.
[28:20.340 --> 28:22.540]  I would love that, that's all you've got to do.
[28:22.540 --> 28:23.660]  Maybe send me some of them.
[28:23.660 --> 28:26.260]  I do appreciate getting seeds from my friends
[28:26.260 --> 28:28.540]  in my mailbox, that is always awesome.
[28:28.540 --> 28:31.180]  But I do invite you to do some breeding.
[28:31.180 --> 28:32.580]  Find the plants that work best for you,
[28:32.580 --> 28:35.260]  grow them a couple of times, understand why.
[28:35.260 --> 28:37.180]  I have a good goal, it seems like you do.
[28:37.180 --> 28:38.340]  And then do your breeding, bro.
[28:38.340 --> 28:39.980]  Grow from your heart, breed with love
[28:39.980 --> 28:42.680]  and show me pictures of the results.
[28:42.720 --> 28:44.480]  It says, if this email makes it to the show,
[28:44.480 --> 28:46.400]  please don't read this sentence.
[28:46.400 --> 28:47.800]  All right.
[28:47.800 --> 28:49.480]  No, I don't plan on working with the cross
[28:49.480 --> 28:52.080]  that you're working with and I'm not even a fan
[28:52.080 --> 28:54.680]  of that plant, no offense to it, that's just not my thing.
[28:54.680 --> 28:56.880]  So you're gonna do something totally different
[28:56.880 --> 28:59.160]  than what I would do in joy.
[28:59.160 --> 29:02.080]  Then it says, finally, do you have an application
[29:02.080 --> 29:03.320]  to become a seed tester?
[29:03.320 --> 29:05.040]  I could not find one on the website.
[29:05.040 --> 29:08.160]  I'm not an expert grower, but I am not a noob either.
[29:08.160 --> 29:09.640]  Obviously, any seeds that you sent me
[29:09.640 --> 29:12.800]  would automatically refrain from doing any pollen chucking
[29:12.800 --> 29:15.720]  or anything else for that matter other than testing them.
[29:15.720 --> 29:17.420]  I do appreciate that, thank you.
[29:17.420 --> 29:20.200]  There is not an official tester application.
[29:20.200 --> 29:22.800]  I've put out an episode about testing seeds.
[29:22.800 --> 29:25.160]  I basically ask you to watch that episode,
[29:25.160 --> 29:27.160]  send me an email, then if you wanna be a tester,
[29:27.160 --> 29:29.760]  you will be required to join the new Discord server
[29:29.760 --> 29:32.720]  and post all of your test photos on the new Discord server
[29:32.720 --> 29:34.740]  in the tester section.
[29:34.740 --> 29:36.320]  That is what I would like if you're qualified
[29:36.320 --> 29:37.440]  and able to do that.
[29:37.440 --> 29:40.040]  Send me a message, maybe send me a few pictures
[29:40.040 --> 29:41.780]  of your grow, just say, hey, these are the pictures
[29:41.780 --> 29:43.760]  I could take, this is what I can do.
[29:43.760 --> 29:45.880]  Let me know that you're detail-oriented,
[29:45.880 --> 29:47.200]  let me know your skill level,
[29:47.200 --> 29:48.880]  and then I will consider you as a tester.
[29:48.880 --> 29:50.360]  So send me that email.
[29:50.360 --> 29:52.480]  I will do my best to get test seeds out.
[29:52.480 --> 29:54.280]  And I do appreciate that you know better
[29:54.280 --> 29:56.240]  than to breed with my test seeds.
[29:56.240 --> 29:58.680]  That is always frowned upon in the tester community.
[29:58.680 --> 30:00.160]  I don't know that those seeds are any good.
[30:00.160 --> 30:02.040]  I don't know the future of my new cross.
[30:02.040 --> 30:03.480]  I hate it when people breed with shit
[30:03.480 --> 30:04.600]  that I send them as testers.
[30:04.600 --> 30:05.640]  That's not cool.
[30:05.640 --> 30:07.360]  Let me do what I'm gonna do with it
[30:07.360 --> 30:08.720]  before other people get out there
[30:08.720 --> 30:10.100]  and do their thing with it.
[30:10.100 --> 30:12.080]  That's why I trusted you with testers.
[30:12.080 --> 30:15.160]  Anyway, yeah, send me a message about testing,
[30:15.160 --> 30:17.380]  send me some pictures of your grow, send me some details.
[30:17.380 --> 30:18.640]  Watch the tester video.
[30:18.640 --> 30:20.600]  I do have a few rules and a few,
[30:20.600 --> 30:22.460]  a little bit of criteria that I would like.
[30:22.460 --> 30:24.080]  Run them as soon as possible.
[30:24.080 --> 30:27.200]  Don't share clones, don't share seeds, don't share pollen.
[30:27.200 --> 30:29.840]  Don't do anything with them until I give you a go-ahead.
[30:29.840 --> 30:31.840]  But yeah, please do send me an application,
[30:31.840 --> 30:33.160]  send me an email about it.
[30:33.160 --> 30:35.380]  It goes on, it says, sorry for the long email.
[30:36.120 --> 30:38.380]  Stay iry and take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
[30:38.380 --> 30:40.660]  Cheers from your friend Seth.
[30:40.660 --> 30:43.580]  P.S. I'm in New York now, so things are legal.
[30:43.580 --> 30:45.560]  Big shout out to our friends up there in New York.
[30:45.560 --> 30:48.980]  Extra thanks to my friend Seth for the great message.
[30:48.980 --> 30:51.020]  Seth, I hope I answered all of your questions
[30:51.020 --> 30:51.900]  in great detail.
[30:51.900 --> 30:53.740]  I look forward to seeing the breeding project
[30:53.740 --> 30:56.020]  that you do create with my Firefly.
[30:56.020 --> 30:59.500]  If you have any more questions, please do follow up.
[30:59.500 --> 31:02.180]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, pimps, hoes,
[31:02.180 --> 31:04.760]  friends, foes, smokers, growers, clone cutters,
[31:05.200 --> 31:07.480]  pollen chuckers, all of you sexy cannabis enthusiasts
[31:07.480 --> 31:09.760]  out there, I do wanna thank you once again for listening
[31:09.760 --> 31:13.700]  to episode 737 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.

[31:17.080 --> 31:18.640]  maybe you'd just like to throw me a couple of bucks
[31:18.640 --> 31:20.400]  for taking a moment out of my day,
