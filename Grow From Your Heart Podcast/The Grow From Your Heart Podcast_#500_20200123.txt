[00:00.190 --> 00:04.450]  That is a great way to start. Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome, welcome, welcome
[00:04.450 --> 00:09.770]  to episode 500 of the grow from your heart podcast. Joining me in no particular order
[00:09.770 --> 00:14.170]  at the table. Welcome back. White Mike. We've got double door dank across the table and
[00:14.170 --> 00:22.570]  big tall Clint is here. I am excited for 500. Welcome to the show boys. Hey, if you guys
[00:22.570 --> 00:27.090]  cannot tell, we've been hanging out. We've had a few pre-show dabs. Clint did not dab.
[00:27.090 --> 00:31.050]  I've tried to get him to dab. He won't even hit the vape pens, but we're getting there.
[00:31.050 --> 00:34.290]  Clint may dab by, what do you think? By seven 50, maybe episode a thousand. We'll get you
[00:34.290 --> 00:40.090]  dabbing. Nope. All right. No, not even a fucking, not even trying. But the other boys here in
[00:40.090 --> 00:44.210]  the room, the other gentlemen, the other men in the room. Oh, I see. I see where we're
[00:44.210 --> 00:49.530]  going with this. I love you, bro. Nothing like that. We're getting well red eyed. We
[00:49.530 --> 00:53.570]  are giggly. We are having a good time. We are excited and pumped up for episode 500.
[00:53.570 --> 00:56.810]  At least I'm excited. I don't mean to talk for everybody else. Everyone's got a smile
[00:56.810 --> 01:03.730]  on their nodding. So I guess everyone's excited. Those nods transfer well on podcasts. As always,
[01:03.730 --> 01:06.650]  this episode is brought to you by our friends at seeds here. Now seeds here. Now, if you
[01:06.650 --> 01:10.290]  need new regular feminized or auto flower seeds in your garden, I highly recommend seeds
[01:10.290 --> 01:16.650]  here. Now you know where to find them at seeds here now.com. Um, I usually do a shout out
[01:16.650 --> 01:21.650]  to a bunch of individuals on Patrion. We're just going to cover it like this. Holy shit.
[01:21.650 --> 01:26.930]  You guys, my Patreon has been exploding and we appreciate it. I appreciate the shit out
[01:26.930 --> 01:31.410]  of it. You guys helped me out very well in December. January is going to crush it. A
[01:31.410 --> 01:35.410]  big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon. If you're not sure what I'm
[01:35.410 --> 01:41.170]  talking about, go to patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart, figure out how you can
[01:41.170 --> 01:45.970]  support the show financially as little as $1 as much as I don't think there's a limit.
[01:45.970 --> 01:49.170]  You can probably type in a bunch of zeros or a bunch of nines and put all the dollars
[01:49.570 --> 01:51.570]  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Definitely give him a lot.
[01:53.730 --> 01:59.490]  Like just too much. There you go. Max out your mom's credit card. Yeah. Your mom's credit card.
[01:59.490 --> 02:03.090]  Do it Doug Stanhope style. And if you know what I'm talking about, you're a fucking champion.
[02:03.090 --> 02:06.690]  You guys, this is going to be a fun show. I did a quick Instagram live. So people will be pumped
[02:06.690 --> 02:11.410]  up to hear this when it does come out. Yes. Yes. We were pre-recording. Yes. But when this comes
[02:11.410 --> 02:15.010]  out, I think we will be at the endo expo when this episode comes out. So it's going to be great.
[02:15.010 --> 02:19.330]  Thanks for listening. You guys, we will have an endo expo wrap up shortly after this
[02:19.330 --> 02:22.610]  episode. We've introduced the friends, we've covered the business,
[02:23.650 --> 02:29.810]  dude, 500 episodes. I want to thank everybody for listening to 500 episodes of this crazy nonsense.
[02:29.810 --> 02:34.450]  I started a little podcast with this idea of like, there are some myths and rumors online,
[02:34.450 --> 02:38.450]  and I see a bunch of crap on forums that I don't quite agree with. So maybe I could just kind of
[02:38.450 --> 02:43.010]  break some of those rumors and kind of give some useful advice by doing a podcast. Here I am 500
[02:43.010 --> 02:46.930]  episodes later. Well, people like if I'm an hour late posting a show, like, Hey bro, where's the
[02:46.930 --> 02:50.450]  podcast? Like itch in their neck. Like you got, y'all got more of them grow from your heart,
[02:50.450 --> 02:55.810]  podcast episodes. Like people are ready for this shit. And I love it. People are angry at home.
[02:55.810 --> 02:59.650]  Yeah. Yeah. I go to the grocery store and people don't know who I am. Right. And then I get up to
[02:59.650 --> 03:03.250]  the cash register and they're like, uh, anything else you need? And I go, no, I've got everything.
[03:03.250 --> 03:06.930]  Or I say I speak finally. And someone in the grocery store turns, they go, dude, are you the
[03:06.930 --> 03:11.250]  guy from the show? They didn't know who I was the entire time I was there until they heard me speak
[03:11.250 --> 03:14.290]  and they hear my voice. And they're like, you're the guy from the grow from your heart podcast.
[03:14.290 --> 03:18.610]  And I find out so many people listen that I had no idea. Uh, it's pretty rad. Then I hear that
[03:18.610 --> 03:22.850]  grow stores and dispensaries play me as their background music. So I'm in the waiting room
[03:22.850 --> 03:26.770]  at dispensaries and I'm in a growth store right now. We're at way to grow right now talking about
[03:26.770 --> 03:31.570]  this. Hey, buy a lot of stuff. I wish I didn't know that. Yeah, no, we're just do your thing,
[03:31.570 --> 03:35.330]  bro. Be on the show. It's not that big a deal. You know, a lot of trimmers around here probably
[03:35.330 --> 03:40.130]  listen to your podcast. A lot of trim crews, a lot of grow crews, a lot of those folks listen to us.
[03:40.130 --> 03:43.730]  A lot of the industry is listening and that's intimidating to me. That makes me make sure I'm
[03:43.730 --> 03:48.050]  on my shit. Uh, that's another thing. We've got a very good corrections department out there.
[03:48.050 --> 03:52.130]  If I make a mistake, right, we do feels like before I post the goddamn show, I'm getting
[03:52.130 --> 03:56.130]  emails that I made a mistake. Like the show comes out Friday, Thursday night, I got an email saying
[03:56.130 --> 03:59.970]  he fucked up. And I'm like, how did you know they're quick? The corrections are correct.
[03:59.970 --> 04:03.890]  But how did you know the corrections department is hot on the spot out there? So thank you. I
[04:03.890 --> 04:08.930]  do appreciate it. Don't be shy. If I ever fuck up, send me an email because I sent a message to a lot
[04:08.930 --> 04:12.130]  of people and it's wrong. So I don't want to teach people wrong. So if you hear a mistake,
[04:12.130 --> 04:17.010]  let me know. We'll get it corrected. All that good shit. Uh, my, my point was, holy shit. Thank you
[04:17.010 --> 04:21.650]  for listening. And thank you for supporting, uh, the grow from your heart podcast for 500 episodes.
[04:21.650 --> 04:27.410]  That is crazy. Um, I know I'm all sentimental. I promised I wouldn't cry. Um, so you guys,
[04:28.050 --> 04:33.010]  it's a 500th episode. Let's talk about, do you guys have any, I know, uh, fucking Matt's kind
[04:33.010 --> 04:35.970]  of new to the show. You've only been around for a little while, but you've been listening.
[04:36.050 --> 04:39.250]  Um, do you guys have any, we'll start with Mike since he's, we're going to go in a circle.
[04:39.250 --> 04:43.730]  Do you guys have any favorite episodes or favorite moments out of 500 episodes?
[04:44.530 --> 04:50.290]  I like the, the Centennial episodes, the 100, I think it was like 102. Did we do it too? We did
[04:50.290 --> 04:55.170]  it too. We did it too. Maybe did a two 50 knowing me 100 and 400. I think were my favorites. Okay.
[04:55.170 --> 04:59.970]  Uh, when we get like Spencer and the big crew here, when we had the big table for 100 was a lot
[04:59.970 --> 05:03.570]  fun. We had the big table and the little table. There used to be another table over there. Two
[05:03.570 --> 05:07.970]  tables for that one. Yeah. That one's a sloppy took a dab out of the rig with no water. Yep.
[05:07.970 --> 05:14.930]  Yeah. That was a good podcast. And then my microphone dab where that's funny that you say
[05:14.930 --> 05:18.930]  that, bro, that's a great segue because I wrote down a favorite moment of each of you guys. And
[05:18.930 --> 05:23.170]  it says, Mike smoked the microphone. That's my, one of my favorite moments of being on the show
[05:23.170 --> 05:26.370]  with you. That didn't work at all. Imagine. And I'm going to give these guys here on the show,
[05:26.370 --> 05:31.090]  a visual, a visual. Imagine if I had the dab rig like this and you've got the dab, it was this rig
[05:31.090 --> 05:35.090]  and Mike put the dab into the banger. Like he was going to make it work, but he put his mouth
[05:35.090 --> 05:42.770]  on the microphone. He tried to smoke through the microphone and took it like a champ. I laugh like
[05:42.770 --> 05:49.490]  a champ. I hit it until my eyes registered that the rig wasn't responding correctly to my inhalation.
[05:49.490 --> 05:54.290]  There's no bubbles. What's happening? Something's wrong. Cause I'm sucking and there's no bubbles
[05:54.290 --> 05:58.930]  or, Oh shit. That's a microphone, not a mouthpiece. You've got these mics in front of you.
[05:58.930 --> 06:02.450]  It's not comfortable. This is not natural. Like if you don't do this, this is, you're not used to
[06:02.450 --> 06:06.770]  having this big thing here. So it was totally funny to me. And I really laughed at that.
[06:06.770 --> 06:09.810]  That's very fun. Everyone's adjusting their mics now, since I said that, that's funny. You're
[06:09.810 --> 06:12.850]  going to be more conscious of it. Don't worry guys. It's a podcast. Get stoned, have fun.
[06:13.570 --> 06:17.730]  Matt, you're new to the show, bro. You're kind of one of the new homies, which is why I wanted
[06:17.730 --> 06:21.250]  to bring you. We've got Mike. Who's been here since basically the beginning. We got Clint,
[06:21.250 --> 06:24.130]  who came around around the middle and then you're brand new. So it's cool to have. That's why I
[06:24.130 --> 06:28.050]  wanted this little spectrum of folks here. And Jesse was invited, but could not make it.
[06:28.050 --> 06:31.730]  Jesse's working hard on the farm. I did send a message to somebody else. Didn't hear a reply.
[06:31.730 --> 06:35.890]  So shout out to everybody else. I tried to get you guys, but we don't got no more room anyway.
[06:35.890 --> 06:40.610]  So let's hear your, maybe one of your favorite or most memorable moments from the show, bro.
[06:42.610 --> 06:49.170]  Honestly, I binge watch your show. So they all kind of blend together a lot of times.
[06:49.890 --> 06:53.330]  And that's how content is taken nowadays. That's how we do it. We just watch
[06:53.330 --> 07:00.130]  seven episodes all day. I enjoy it all, man, from the grow knowledge, just to even hearing
[07:00.130 --> 07:05.890]  about your strains and your crosses, because as a grower myself, I'm always interested in what's
[07:05.890 --> 07:10.370]  coming out new. Nice. My memorable moment. Well, I've had you on the show recently.
[07:11.410 --> 07:14.610]  It was watching you get fucking stoned and then try to get your shit together for the show.
[07:15.330 --> 07:19.970]  I didn't realize how stoned you were before we recorded. Oh, holy shit. Yeah. And then when I
[07:20.050 --> 07:23.570]  hit Rick, well, cause it's fun. This is what happens. People think I'm fine. I'm fine. And
[07:23.570 --> 07:27.250]  everybody thinks I'm fine. And then you put a microphone in front of people that don't broadcast
[07:27.250 --> 07:32.050]  or record or do anything. And they suddenly go, I'm not fine. Yeah, man, you get twice as, or
[07:32.050 --> 07:35.890]  three times or four times as high. And I didn't realize I had done that to you. So it kind of,
[07:35.890 --> 07:38.530]  kind of ease you into it. But I remember that. And I thought it was great. I don't mind that
[07:38.530 --> 07:42.050]  shit. I love when people are, you become more, uh, wouldn't have been the first guest to need
[07:42.050 --> 07:47.170]  a nap. Oh man. That's funny. Jesse didn't show up, but then memorable. One of my most memorable
[07:47.170 --> 07:51.570]  moments for Jesse was in the middle of a podcast. He gave me the, the fucking across the throat
[07:51.570 --> 07:55.570]  thing of like, cut, cut, cut. And so I just finished up my sentence, pressed pause. And he
[07:55.570 --> 08:00.210]  stood up and went late on that couch over there. He didn't say much for like an hour. I think I
[08:00.210 --> 08:03.250]  gave him some cookies and a bottle of water and he just laid over there on the couch. That was my
[08:03.250 --> 08:07.490]  memorable moment for Jesse for sure. But yeah, I do have a tendency to kind of wreck people. It's
[08:07.490 --> 08:11.570]  this dab rig and these good concentrates in this environment. Everyone feels so comfortable here
[08:11.570 --> 08:16.850]  that they're like, fuck it. Let's smoke. Yeah. I've never heard such a unlistenable version of
[08:16.850 --> 08:21.490]  what cookies and cream was Jesus Christ, man. When I went back and listened to that, I was like,
[08:21.490 --> 08:27.730]  Holy fuck, dude. Like, yeah, no, we dab out hard. And I think, uh, for Jeff to put out as great
[08:27.730 --> 08:33.970]  content as he does and to hit that rig, like he does this fucking incredible man's a train.
[08:35.010 --> 08:39.810]  I'll agree with that. I think that's a compliment. So thanks. I think he's not exaggerating. I, we
[08:39.810 --> 08:44.690]  took a few extra minutes to start the show because I took probably three or four extra dabs that
[08:44.690 --> 08:48.690]  these guys were not involved in. The mic went to go have a cigarette and I was like, well, here we
[08:48.690 --> 08:53.410]  go then. And to just make sure that I was well-prepared and yeah. I had to get a little
[08:53.410 --> 08:58.290]  more baked. Now they're still passing around this bowl. Yeah. Yeah, man. Um, yeah, the bowl doesn't
[08:58.290 --> 09:03.010]  make the torch sound. So it gets a little more longer in the show. Uh, Clint, you look like
[09:03.010 --> 09:07.570]  you're eager to tell me your most memorable moment. Oh, I am dude. Let's hear about it, bro.
[09:07.570 --> 09:14.530]  I, uh, I was growing those plants. I was growing, I had a six hemp plants that I was growing. Cause
[09:14.530 --> 09:21.970]  I'd been working on that farm. And, uh, so I was finishing up those and going through your drying
[09:21.970 --> 09:29.090]  and curing tutorials was what made it to our actually like, Oh, nice have decent non moldy.
[09:29.890 --> 09:35.490]  Like not, I didn't need them to be like super moist or anything. Cause it's hemp and I'm going
[09:35.490 --> 09:39.970]  to grind it all down anyway. But there was just some key things that you, you know,
[09:40.530 --> 09:44.690]  hang it upside down for like a week in a 50% humidity. Here's how you do that.
[09:45.330 --> 09:50.370]  And just things like that. So that's my favorite because I, I would go back and listen to that
[09:50.370 --> 09:55.090]  over and over. And that really helped me a lot. So I don't know if I ever told you that. Yeah.
[09:55.090 --> 09:58.850]  Well, that's, that's spectacular. Yeah. Thank you, man. And I'm proud of you because you've brought
[09:58.850 --> 10:03.330]  over, you brought over some weed that you grew your first batch and it was, you know, it looked
[10:03.330 --> 10:06.450]  like some weed that you grew and I can tell some outdoor that you kind of, you know, you grew some
[10:06.450 --> 10:09.810]  weed and then you brought over that branch recently and you're like, this got broken off a plant.
[10:09.810 --> 10:13.970]  I tried and cured and trimmed it. That was a tremendous difference. It was way better. I even
[10:13.970 --> 10:19.410]  smoked it and complimented it. It tasted good. So I've seen evolution in, excuse the throat clearing.
[10:19.410 --> 10:23.650]  I've seen evolution in your cannabis growth. You're better now than you were when I first,
[10:23.650 --> 10:26.770]  when you first started growing, you didn't even smoke when I first met you. So you've come a long
[10:26.770 --> 10:31.970]  way. Yeah, dude. I knew you right before the podcast started. Wow. Cause you started a different
[10:31.970 --> 10:36.690]  podcast and that's how we met. Yep. I've been listening for a long time, but I was really able
[10:36.770 --> 10:43.010]  to hone in on some skills. Like, like you said, like having the experience of having done it once
[10:43.010 --> 10:49.410]  too, like, okay, I really should have stopped here. I should have stopped drying here instead
[10:49.410 --> 10:55.570]  of giving it that extra day or two days, you know? And it was just an outdoor grow, you know, it's,
[10:55.570 --> 11:02.050]  I first grow and it's, I don't know, I'm addicted. I think I, I like it a lot. It's super fun.
[11:02.050 --> 11:06.690]  I know a lot of people that after one or two, they're like, no, this is like my new thing. Now
[11:06.690 --> 11:11.090]  I love it. You see it. Old school growers used to say the most addicting thing about cannabis
[11:11.090 --> 11:15.730]  is growing cannabis. Yeah. I think that's an Ed Rosenthal shirt, isn't it? That's tight.
[11:15.730 --> 11:19.250]  Could be, but it's true. I find it to be very accurate. I love my plants. I got a relationship
[11:19.250 --> 11:24.690]  with them. I was talking on another podcast about what I call the grower's gaze. When I'm done in
[11:24.690 --> 11:29.250]  my grow room, if it's my small five by five space, if it's a 10 by 10 space, or if it's a giant
[11:29.250 --> 11:34.610]  commercial facility, when I'm done with the work, as I sweep the floor toward the doors, I gather
[11:34.610 --> 11:37.970]  all the trash toward the door. I set everything outside of the door. And then I just stare into
[11:37.970 --> 11:42.450]  the room and it's just this grower's gaze. I'm just, first of all, I'm looking at my work. I'm
[11:42.450 --> 11:46.930]  marveling and look, I did that. That's what, or we did that. If it's a team, like we accomplished
[11:46.930 --> 11:52.930]  that. Those are living organisms that we've kept alive for a bunch of bros, just keeping shit alive.
[11:52.930 --> 11:55.890]  That's impressive in its own. You know what I mean? We should be playing Xbox and fucking
[11:55.890 --> 11:59.410]  high-fiving each other, but we're keeping gardens, million dollar gardens alive.
[11:59.410 --> 12:05.730]  So I marvel at my work. I stare at this work. I go, wow, it's beautiful. And then also I'm just
[12:05.730 --> 12:09.010]  feeling the energy from those plants. They're giving me a vibe. They're saying, man, thank you
[12:09.010 --> 12:13.010]  for making us look so good. You just defoliated me and you cut off all that bottom shit. And I
[12:13.010 --> 12:16.050]  could grow and look how, man, I'm flexing. They look like they just got their hair done. They're
[12:16.050 --> 12:21.170]  like, look how pretty I am. I look so fucking good. And then also that's when I notice the issues.
[12:21.170 --> 12:25.410]  When I'm doing that grower's gaze, just that stare, that's when I hear like,
[12:25.410 --> 12:28.210]  oh, that air conditioner is going ting, ting, ting, ting, ting. Cause now I'm not thinking
[12:28.210 --> 12:33.330]  about defoliating or sweeping. I don't have Joe Rogan in my ear. I'm just, I forgot. I've lost
[12:33.330 --> 12:37.090]  my fucking total train of thought. But now you just get honed in on the plant. It's really nice
[12:37.090 --> 12:42.130]  to have like these goals and like you, like being able to breed things like this and with your
[12:42.130 --> 12:46.290]  phenol hunting and stuff like that. Like I'm excited to move on to like maybe something,
[12:46.290 --> 12:49.810]  you know, actually grow one of your strains this year. Whenever you're ready,
[12:50.050 --> 12:53.810]  you know, you are ready. I got to figure that out. So we'll see, we'll see where the,
[12:53.810 --> 12:57.730]  where the tent can go up and we'll go from there. Can't wait. All right. The next thing that I had
[12:57.730 --> 13:02.850]  written down that I wanted to talk about was, did we learn anything in 500 episodes? It sounds like
[13:02.850 --> 13:08.130]  Clint has been learning his ass off for the past 500 episodes. Like you've learned how to dry and
[13:08.130 --> 13:11.890]  cure. Uh, what was the most valuable thing? Was it probably the drying and curing that you've
[13:11.890 --> 13:16.690]  learned? You know that I would have to say that because the, the grow knowledge, you know,
[13:16.690 --> 13:22.690]  through veg at least is pretty, pretty easy. They grow, they grow, you feed them, they grow.
[13:22.690 --> 13:28.290]  It's amazing. You put them in, you know, don't leave them in those black five gallons either,
[13:28.290 --> 13:35.250]  but you know, I'm learning. Um, but I mean, there's just so much to learn about the plant.
[13:35.250 --> 13:43.250]  I mean, I think, I don't know, Matt, I think the most valuable thing is you said to read books.
[13:43.250 --> 13:47.730]  Yeah. And so that helped me a lot too. Like I got that Rosenthal's and then I, you know,
[13:47.730 --> 13:52.850]  just being able to go on the internet and actually like find a credible source is not hard anymore.
[13:52.850 --> 13:57.570]  Yeah. All of the books I recommend are available on a PDF form on the internet for free. And we're
[13:57.570 --> 14:01.570]  all taking a poop at some point in our life and we'd probably scroll Facebook. So just type in
[14:01.570 --> 14:05.810]  the name of a book and do that instead. But there's totally a reason humans have been
[14:05.810 --> 14:10.690]  playing with this plant since we found it. Oh yeah. It's marvelous. I love it.
[14:10.690 --> 14:13.570]  There's not one group of people on the planet that ran into cannabis.
[14:13.570 --> 14:16.610]  So you loop me back around to the thought that I lost. That's beautiful. We were saying that
[14:16.610 --> 14:20.450]  we're, I'm more addicted to growing it than smoking it. And that's why I get that grower's
[14:20.450 --> 14:25.250]  gaze. It's just beautiful. I'm just staring at it going, Oh, it's my plants. It's just so amazing.
[14:25.250 --> 14:29.170]  Yeah. It's an accomplishment. I'm excited that you have learned so much. It's good seeing one
[14:29.170 --> 14:34.610]  of my bros go from kind of interested in smoking, hanging out with a bunch of stoners. Like I smoke
[14:34.610 --> 14:37.810]  occasionally. And then you got a job at a hemp farm and then you learned a lot about it. And
[14:37.810 --> 14:41.010]  now you've actually produced your own cannabis that you're able to enjoy. So I'm proud of you,
[14:41.010 --> 14:45.010]  bro. You've come a long way, not just as a stoner. I love that you're on our team now,
[14:45.010 --> 14:49.250]  but I love that you're growing and that you know how to do it. You can teach other people. And now
[14:49.250 --> 14:52.930]  that's another more people will learn how to grow like in the future because of that. So that's
[14:52.930 --> 14:57.170]  awesome. That's part of my goal. I got a lot to learn before I think I can teach anybody, but
[14:57.170 --> 15:02.690]  I do feel what you're saying. Thank you, bro. Let's move to the left. Mr. Double door. Dank.
[15:02.690 --> 15:04.930]  What have you learned in 500 episodes of the show, brother?
[15:05.490 --> 15:11.890]  Oh man, I've learned a lot. Honestly, environmental control with you has been
[15:11.890 --> 15:17.810]  probably the key thing that I've focused in on. Really listening to your episodes kind of
[15:17.810 --> 15:24.210]  makes me go back and question like, what is my VPD and making sure that I am consistent with
[15:25.330 --> 15:31.650]  the rooms environment all throughout, not just in one section and trying to just dial everything in
[15:32.450 --> 15:36.850]  and I like the episode where you describe dialing in the room.
[15:36.850 --> 15:41.490]  Yeah. Nice. Awesome, man. Thank you. I love hearing that kind of stuff.
[15:41.490 --> 15:43.250]  Corrector Mike, he tilted your head like you're ready.
[15:43.810 --> 15:48.850]  There's so much that we've learned over 500 episodes, dude, like from how to record a good
[15:48.850 --> 15:55.330]  podcast to sound editing to which pieces of equipment or pieces of shit to, I mean, all the
[15:55.330 --> 16:00.290]  different grow knowledge that we've specifically researched. So you can do those episodes.
[16:00.530 --> 16:02.690]  Like there's a lot we've learned here.
[16:04.130 --> 16:07.170]  You've taught us a lot, bro. You've taught people how to be active and how to
[16:07.170 --> 16:11.170]  I've learned how to be more effective. Just trying different shit at council. Like I'm
[16:11.170 --> 16:16.770]  trying to think back to like episodes one through 10, like what else was going on then? And
[16:17.730 --> 16:22.530]  like, I don't think Pueblo had regulations for legal cannabis yet. I think we're still
[16:22.530 --> 16:28.050]  bitching about them or just getting started into hammering those out and we've gone full circle.
[16:28.050 --> 16:32.530]  But now we're reviewing all of those now. It's been a long, strange trip, brother.
[16:32.530 --> 16:37.650]  It's been a fun evolution. The birthday of the show is coming up in March or April. So we'll
[16:37.650 --> 16:41.490]  have a birthday show here coming pretty soon. What did the hash look like for episode one?
[16:41.490 --> 16:44.370]  Oh, the hash for episode one was dark, shitty shatter.
[16:44.370 --> 16:47.010]  And was it black and a coke file? Was it that still?
[16:47.010 --> 16:50.530]  No, it wasn't that stuff yet. It wasn't. It was, uh, we were past that. I think it was
[16:50.530 --> 16:53.970]  crappy shatter at that crappy shatter. Yeah. Cause I remember doing like the two gram
[16:53.970 --> 16:57.650]  shatter dabs and stuff back then. Oh, don't you miss the titanium nail?
[16:58.610 --> 17:02.210]  And the old shatter. I just found one going through some stuff.
[17:03.010 --> 17:05.650]  The show used to be sponsored by highly educated titanium.
[17:05.650 --> 17:07.010]  No kidding. Yeah. Back in the day.
[17:09.250 --> 17:13.250]  Yeah. Shout out to task and highly educated. He's gone from making titanium. Now we make some of the
[17:13.250 --> 17:17.570]  best courts bangers on the planet. He calls them the gavel. Uh, pretty nice fucking piece of
[17:17.570 --> 17:21.970]  equipment. Yeah. Oh yeah. Shout out to task rock. Uh, man, I've learned a lot. I guess I should talk
[17:21.970 --> 17:28.690]  about stuff that I have learned. Um, Oh, I never told us about my favorite moment of Clint. One
[17:28.690 --> 17:33.010]  time I was starting a podcast episode and I used to start with music and I would go, yeah, welcome
[17:33.010 --> 17:38.690]  back pot. And as soon as I took a breath to go, yeah, Clint beat me to it. He goes, yeah, like way
[17:38.690 --> 17:42.690]  different than I do it. Like he came in, he like totally tried to opposite. I could see him like
[17:42.690 --> 17:48.210]  timing it and shit. And I was like, he's going to do any instead of, yeah, he goes, yeah. Just like
[17:48.210 --> 17:51.650]  off. It didn't even sound good. I was just like, Oh, that was, there's a beautiful crash. It was
[17:51.650 --> 17:58.290]  my favorite moments of you most easily remembered moments of you. Yeah. Yeah. I try not to do that
[17:58.290 --> 18:02.050]  as much anymore, but it was fun. We've grown out of that, but it was fun. It was highly acceptable
[18:02.050 --> 18:06.610]  that time people loved it. The listeners loved it. Yeah. People are fun. Oh, it's a fun podcast.
[18:06.610 --> 18:11.250]  What's the point if we're not having fun? Like I was a, I love learning, but I hated school and
[18:11.250 --> 18:14.850]  sitting there and feel like I was being lectured. If they would've made school fun, I'd have like a
[18:14.850 --> 18:18.690]  quadruple major, right? Yeah. I would do that, but it was boring. I don't want to sit there and
[18:18.690 --> 18:22.610]  get lectured and shit. I want to put my hands on stuff and see what happens if I do it wrong.
[18:22.610 --> 18:26.850]  Like, you know, like that's so yeah. You got to teach in a different way. I'm going to talk about
[18:27.410 --> 18:30.610]  the things that I've learned. Like Mike said, I've learned how to podcast. I've learned when
[18:30.610 --> 18:34.610]  to quit rambling about something that doesn't matter. Almost. I'm getting there. I've learned
[18:34.610 --> 18:39.170]  a lot about growing. I've changed a lot of my approaches to a lot of things. And I've learned
[18:39.170 --> 18:45.570]  that it's okay if you want to grow and evolve, it is okay to change your ideas and your approach
[18:45.570 --> 18:50.210]  and your direction. If you learn something new, that could disrupt your entire schedule,
[18:50.210 --> 18:54.370]  your entire plan. But if it improves something, and if you knew you were making a mistake,
[18:54.370 --> 18:57.970]  or if you can compound on something and make it better, why not change?
[18:57.970 --> 19:01.490]  So I've had to fucking change on the fly. I've learned to just adjust and grow. I've learned a
[19:01.490 --> 19:05.330]  lot of shit over the past few years. I've learned to say, oh yeah, that was my old way of doing it.
[19:05.330 --> 19:08.690]  This is how I do it now. I may have been wrong before and I'm comfortable with that.
[19:08.770 --> 19:11.650]  Well, you have to, everybody's got to evolve, man.
[19:11.650 --> 19:17.010]  Yeah. Well, I've gone from, in my grow evolution, I went from a three by three grow,
[19:17.010 --> 19:21.730]  then I went from a computer box lined with foil. Basically it was my first real attempt at growing.
[19:21.730 --> 19:25.890]  I got a computer box and put foil in it and put, yeah, that was whack, but it made weed.
[19:26.450 --> 19:33.170]  But then I got a three by three tent and then I got a 11 by 14 room. And then I had an 11 by
[19:33.170 --> 19:38.370]  14 room and like some more rooms. And then I had like a couple of eight by eight tents. And then
[19:38.610 --> 19:42.610]  it just started getting crazy. And then now I run facilities that have a thousand lights
[19:42.610 --> 19:46.530]  completely in the whole facility. And so I have learned a lot. And if you listen to the show,
[19:46.530 --> 19:51.330]  you've heard my evolution. You've paid attention and seen my growth and go from, oh, this is how
[19:51.330 --> 19:55.570]  we would do a couple of plants to, this is how we do fucking 7,000 plants in one day with a crew of
[19:55.570 --> 19:59.490]  six. I'm like, yeah, I figured out, I've learned a lot of stuff. And I've learned how to cut out a
[19:59.490 --> 20:03.730]  lot of crappy steps and learned what is, learned to kind of filter out what's not necessary and
[20:03.730 --> 20:07.410]  what we do really need to do. Because once you get to a commercial grow, like Matt's got big
[20:07.410 --> 20:10.850]  experience in a commercial grow, you cut out a lot of the crap and then you take that to your
[20:10.850 --> 20:17.250]  home grow and your home grow just flourishes. Oh yeah. I think learning how to keep a healthy veg
[20:18.370 --> 20:25.570]  and keep cycles going perpetual on a commercial scale is something it's invaluable to a grower,
[20:26.690 --> 20:33.570]  especially at your home because you take that knowledge and really veg is the point where
[20:33.570 --> 20:39.410]  you're going to have either success or failure. Scheduling problems and yeah, powerful plants,
[20:39.410 --> 20:44.930]  healthy, happy plants. It's a rhythm that varies plant to plant and strain to strain. So like
[20:44.930 --> 20:48.690]  you really have to be in tune with it to do it right. And I've seen it done well and I've seen
[20:48.690 --> 20:55.650]  it done not well. Thank you. Yeah. It's funny you mentioned- When everything's humming, it is so
[20:55.650 --> 21:02.210]  much fun. It doesn't matter if it's one plant or six plants or 16,000 plants. When it's going well,
[21:02.210 --> 21:08.530]  it is so much fun. Yeah. It's funny you mentioned the little foil line box or whatever. I remember
[21:08.530 --> 21:13.250]  being like 12 and finding one of those in my uncle's house and be like, what the hell is this?
[21:13.250 --> 21:17.570]  Why is this shining? And lights in here? This is great. And he's like, oh, leave that alone.
[21:18.530 --> 21:22.210]  That's for taking pictures. That's my photography box. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know? Right.
[21:23.010 --> 21:28.370]  All right. So I asked a bunch of great questions. I got my guests interacted and involved. I've got
[21:28.370 --> 21:32.530]  a couple of emails that I think would be very appropriate for this episode of the show. First,
[21:32.530 --> 21:36.930]  I want to read this one just because it's kind of funny. And you guys are Pueblo folk. This one says,
[21:36.930 --> 21:42.130]  Dear Rasta Jeff, please don't use my real name. If you need a name, you can call me Used to Be Cool
[21:42.130 --> 21:46.690]  because I used to be cool when I was young. And they spell it E-U-S-T-A, middle initial B, last
[21:46.690 --> 21:49.330]  name Cool. Used to be cool. Man, you're still fucking cool. You're calling yourself Used to
[21:49.330 --> 21:53.410]  Be Cool. You're still stylish. I'm 40 and still kicking ass. There's no reason why you can't.
[21:53.410 --> 21:56.610]  It says, I came across your podcast after I saw you on the Dude Grow Show.
[21:56.610 --> 22:00.930]  While your shows are both entertaining and informative, I try not to miss a single one.
[22:00.930 --> 22:06.370]  I was drawn to your story because my wife has suffered two major life-threatening head injuries
[22:06.370 --> 22:10.690]  during our 40 years of marriage. I'm sorry to hear about your wife and congrats on 40 years.
[22:11.250 --> 22:15.650]  While she has mostly recovered, good to hear, life changed for her and everyone around her. Yes,
[22:15.650 --> 22:19.970]  a brain injury will make shit different. The process of thinking is both complex and amazing.
[22:19.970 --> 22:25.490]  She is one of the nicest and most amazing people I have ever met. And I am truly grateful to still
[22:25.490 --> 22:31.010]  have her in my life, but that is not why I write. All right. So here is why this person writes this.
[22:31.010 --> 22:36.130]  He says, I hear you talk about Pueblo and how cannabis has changed it for the better. Yes,
[22:36.130 --> 22:40.450]  we talk about that a lot. This used to be kind of a little different place. And now it's kind
[22:40.450 --> 22:44.130]  of live laying up. We're getting better food, a better environment because of the cannabis industry,
[22:44.130 --> 22:48.450]  I believe. This person says, in the eighties, we lived in a small Kansas town and our trips from
[22:48.450 --> 22:53.570]  the mountains took us through Pueblo. It was in the mid eighties on a return from camping that
[22:53.570 --> 22:58.770]  we had one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me while traveling happened in Pueblo.
[22:58.770 --> 23:03.250]  As we were approaching Pueblo from the north, we could see a massive thunderstorm over Pueblo. Very
[23:03.250 --> 23:07.010]  common here, right? We get some killer thunderstorms here in the late summer. It was one
[23:07.010 --> 23:12.450]  of those scary purple and green cloud storms. When we got into town, traffic came to a standstill due
[23:12.450 --> 23:17.650]  to serious flooding. My memory is a little fuzzy on this detail, but it might've been where a
[23:17.650 --> 23:23.730]  railroad bridge crossed over the highway and the road dropped down as it went under a bridge.
[23:23.730 --> 23:27.810]  That part made me laugh. Everybody took a breath because they all want to say where it is. Where
[23:27.810 --> 23:32.850]  is that boys? I figured that was 29th street, 29th street under the highway where the railroad
[23:32.850 --> 23:36.850]  bridges, this person was right up by the mall. Used to be really, really bad. It still is.
[23:38.050 --> 23:42.210]  Highway exits. Yup. Yeah. As soon as, if you get rain and you're on that side of town, everybody
[23:42.210 --> 23:46.530]  just scatters. They're like, Nope, do not want to be over on this part of town. Matt's new here. And
[23:46.530 --> 23:51.010]  he knew what we were talking about immediately. And there's a spot on a exit one away to, if you're
[23:51.010 --> 23:56.930]  coming from the freeway, it dips down really far. That spot will flood out too. Yeah. Well, that's
[23:56.930 --> 24:00.770]  new though. I don't think that was even there in the fucking eighties. Yeah. No, it just. Well,
[24:00.770 --> 24:05.250]  it's nice that they remember something that still is a tradition for us. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But
[24:05.970 --> 24:09.570]  we see it on the news every couple of years, that intersection floods. Every couple of years,
[24:09.570 --> 24:14.610]  twice a summer. Yeah. The car cars will fucking float away in that intersection. But there is an
[24:14.610 --> 24:17.570]  upside to this message. And I thought it was really funny because I knew everybody in the
[24:17.570 --> 24:20.930]  room would know exactly. And I said, where the highway dips and there was water. You're like,
[24:20.930 --> 24:24.770]  yeah, fucking North side. It used to be. Yeah. Um, man, thanks for the memories. Then it goes
[24:24.770 --> 24:29.250]  on to say, as we were approaching Pueblo from the North, I know where am I? I'm lost now. Let's see.
[24:29.250 --> 24:33.810]  Let's see. I'm going to catch up. Okay. As we sat in the traffic jam for nearly an hour with no sign
[24:33.810 --> 24:39.170]  that the street would ever clear anytime soon. Uh, then I noticed a woman, uh, about my wife's age,
[24:39.170 --> 24:44.210]  sitting next to us in a pickup. She noticed me and she, and we shared a smile. She also
[24:44.210 --> 24:49.090]  noticed our young children sitting in a backseat. People began breaking off from the standstill to
[24:49.090 --> 24:54.210]  find alternate routes. I think she must've seen my gears in my head turning because she hollered at
[24:54.210 --> 24:59.650]  me. She told us pull in behind me and I'll take you a safe way through town because she did not
[24:59.650 --> 25:05.490]  want us going the dangerous way through town. She led us all the way through town safely through
[25:05.490 --> 25:10.130]  Pueblo. Neither my wife nor I have forgotten that simple act of kindness. So if you read this on the
[25:10.130 --> 25:15.490]  air, I hope that woman is listening. So she will know how much she helped and how much we appreciated
[25:15.490 --> 25:19.330]  it. Keep up the good work, Ross and Jeff, and keep making Pueblo a better place. Is there anything
[25:19.330 --> 25:24.210]  cannabis can't do? Signed, used to be cool. That's a cool fucking message. I thought we would all
[25:24.210 --> 25:29.090]  laugh about them being stuck. And then they got a nice person to guide them through town. Um,
[25:29.090 --> 25:34.050]  I don't know which way they took them probably down Elizabeth, but depends on where they were
[25:34.050 --> 25:37.410]  headed. All right. Shout out to used to be cool. I thought that was funny since we're all here
[25:37.410 --> 25:42.530]  sitting at the table. God damn you, Clint. And I love a good positive Pueblo story because someone,
[25:42.530 --> 25:47.890]  so many of them don't take that twist in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. I expected she got like led
[25:47.890 --> 25:52.210]  off by that lady and then went to the bad side of town. She led us to a part of town where there
[25:52.210 --> 25:56.770]  were a bunch of bunch of fucking car dumps and a bunch of landfills. And we've never seen our
[25:56.770 --> 26:01.970]  vehicle or children since we came out of the restaurant, the car was on blocks. Yeah. Top
[26:01.970 --> 26:07.410]  Pueblo stories go. All right. I do have another email from somebody. This is Dan, the indoor man.
[26:07.410 --> 26:12.850]  They show us a lot of support. What up, Dan? What up Dan? The indoor man. It goes like this. It says,
[26:12.850 --> 26:19.090]  Hey bro, it's Dick Dan. If you read this on the air, damn name is Dick Dan. All right. What's up
[26:19.090 --> 26:24.210]  Dick Dan. That's awkward. I have to tell you how much you have helped me through my grows and my
[26:24.210 --> 26:29.490]  life. You're an inspiration to all of us. Well, thanks Dick Dan. Then it says, but hearing the
[26:29.490 --> 26:35.250]  tune at each of your podcasts is something I love and wait to hear for the 500th episode. I thought
[26:35.250 --> 26:40.050]  it would be cool if you could create a playlist and explain why these tunes matter to you. You
[26:40.050 --> 26:44.210]  mentioned that your uncle loved Metallica and it influenced you. And I'd love to hear more about
[26:44.210 --> 26:49.170]  the influences on your life. Not only is your grow knowledge top-notch, but your musical choice
[26:49.170 --> 26:53.570]  is stunning. See my music choices. I might just rolled his eyes. I could see him out of the corner
[26:53.570 --> 26:56.930]  of my eye. He disagrees, but that's all right. That's all right. He listens to three 11. So
[26:56.930 --> 27:00.530]  we're going to be okay. And as I said, through the year, I said it,
[27:02.690 --> 27:07.970]  see a 500, you could make it about music. I also have to tell you the last podcast with Clint and
[27:07.970 --> 27:12.530]  finding your weaknesses and bettering yourself has given me a message. I had kind of ignored.
[27:13.490 --> 27:18.450]  There we go. Food for thought, much love and ultimate respect signed Dick Dan, big shout out
[27:18.450 --> 27:23.730]  to Dick Dan. I don't want to dedicate an entire episode to talking about the music that I enjoy,
[27:23.730 --> 27:29.010]  but I've got a good group of friends here that have a similar yet different musical interests.
[27:29.010 --> 27:33.090]  Matt and I talk about music as he plays a Mike and I have hung out for a long time. So we have
[27:33.090 --> 27:37.410]  suffered each other's music quite a bit. And Mike and our Clint and I kind of match up kind of don't
[27:37.410 --> 27:41.330]  match up on some of the middle of our music lines up. The outer edges are way different in our
[27:41.330 --> 27:48.210]  musical likes. Yeah. We're kind of opposites I'd say. Yeah. There's not a whole lot that I think
[27:48.210 --> 27:52.050]  we would both be like, Oh yeah, this is all right. Let's put you on the spot then if you,
[27:52.050 --> 27:55.330]  what do you like to listen to when you're good and baked? If you just had to pick some music,
[27:55.330 --> 27:59.410]  if you're going to, man, this is allegedly, if you're going to get stoned and drive home
[27:59.410 --> 28:02.530]  and it was fucking nice day and you're just cruising and you know, the fucking drive,
[28:02.530 --> 28:05.890]  when it feels good and you're stoned and got the music on what song are you putting on?
[28:05.890 --> 28:14.210]  Uh, probably put on like Gojira, uh, uh, La Infante de Sauvage. They're a French
[28:14.210 --> 28:18.770]  metal band. They're, they're just brutal. It's, it's really, really good though. It's like,
[28:18.770 --> 28:22.210]  I've actually listened with you because you've told me the name of them and I Googled it. They're
[28:22.210 --> 28:25.970]  good, bro. The music is good. It's heavy. I'm a drummer and I appreciate it. It's melodic too.
[28:25.970 --> 28:31.410]  It's not like screamy. I don't know. It's in there screaming about like, uh, fixing world issues like
[28:31.410 --> 28:35.810]  global warming and like endangered species and stuff. They're not cursing. It's all in English.
[28:35.810 --> 28:39.570]  I'm really like putting this band over cause I liked them a lot. I can tell you got enthusiastic
[28:39.570 --> 28:46.450]  suddenly. That's rad. Yeah. Say the name again. Gojira G O J I R A. There you go. You guys,
[28:46.450 --> 28:50.290]  maybe Gojira, Gojira. Check it out though. They're French. Clint really likes them. I dig
[28:50.290 --> 28:53.650]  their drummer. They're drama drummer. They've got some fucking double bass and some good patterns.
[28:53.650 --> 28:56.930]  They're really good. Uh, yeah. Skilled drummer. You can tell they've gone to school. Uh, they've
[28:56.930 --> 29:01.490]  learned some stuff. So, uh, would that be your first choice is the Gojira. Do you have a backup?
[29:01.490 --> 29:10.850]  Uh, last night I got my record player put up and I was listening to, uh, damn, I can never remember
[29:10.850 --> 29:14.690]  that dude's name. I'm sorry, man. That's all right. Is there a song or something from back
[29:14.690 --> 29:17.890]  in the day that when you smoke and you hear that song, it just gives you that, like,
[29:18.450 --> 29:25.490]  huh? You just get a feels for, for memories from back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. You know,
[29:25.490 --> 29:30.850]  I was such a dork for like country back in the day. So I can listen to some George straight and
[29:30.850 --> 29:35.410]  really like get down on it. Especially like you get a little bit of a broken heart and all of a
[29:35.410 --> 29:43.570]  sudden like country boys are really speaking the gospel. So I don't know, man, I don't do much
[29:43.570 --> 29:47.570]  drinking, but it makes me want to like drink when you're listening to some of those dudes trying
[29:47.570 --> 29:51.330]  to put it down. So I just want to remind you, you did make fun of Mike for listening to three 11
[29:51.330 --> 29:56.610]  just a minute ago. Yeah. Now you guys are even now I'll take my lumps. I understand you guys
[29:56.610 --> 30:00.770]  are even country three 11. I'm going to say you got to quit making fun of each other. People are
[30:00.770 --> 30:06.290]  going to be like metal and country and I'm into that too. So let me know at tall Clint.
[30:07.730 --> 30:11.970]  Man, I can't hate on anybody for their musical choices. I've played music for more than half of
[30:11.970 --> 30:17.490]  my life and I love did I've I'm a drummer for hire. If you need a drummer and you give me a
[30:17.490 --> 30:20.530]  couple of weeks notice and you give me the music, tell me the songs. I've fucking learned those
[30:20.530 --> 30:26.130]  songs. I'll play them on stage. It'll be beautiful. I have been treated with more respect and paid
[30:26.130 --> 30:31.890]  more appropriately by country bands than any rock and roll or blues band ever. The country folks are
[30:31.890 --> 30:37.090]  very professional. They're on time. They speak well, they pay you well, and they're respectful.
[30:37.090 --> 30:41.330]  It's a business. It is a business to them. The rock and roll bands, it's 50, 50 business,
[30:41.330 --> 30:46.130]  50, 50 getting out away from the family on Friday night. So yeah, the country bands, they pay well.
[30:46.130 --> 30:50.610]  And I know a lot of country music on the drums. Like, yeah, there was a band around here that had
[30:50.610 --> 30:55.810]  a very lovely female country singer and they used to pay me very well to be her drummer. Yeah. So I
[30:55.810 --> 31:00.530]  know a lot of the lead, uh, the female lead vocalist country type stuff got paid a lot of
[31:00.530 --> 31:05.250]  money to play it. Well, I mean, there's, there's a lot of money in entertainment of all, of all
[31:05.250 --> 31:10.050]  factions. That's it. Country's a big thing. It's crazy. Especially right here in this part of the
[31:10.050 --> 31:14.130]  country. We got a really cool musical opportunity. You can be in a metal band one night and a country
[31:14.130 --> 31:17.970]  band the next night and a hip hop band the next night here. And every, the bar will be full all
[31:17.970 --> 31:21.730]  three nights. Cause we got such a diverse crowd here. We really do. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'm
[31:21.730 --> 31:24.850]  going to move over here to double door. Cause he's nodding his head. You're excited, bro. What do you
[31:24.850 --> 31:29.570]  like to listen to when you're good and stoned? Um, honestly, the Nirvana unplugged album. Oh,
[31:29.570 --> 31:34.050]  that's a good one. That's good. You're too young for that, bro. That's like Mike and Isaac.
[31:34.690 --> 31:39.170]  That's timeless, dude. Yeah, that's true. Put it on, just let it go, man. The whole album
[31:39.170 --> 31:43.890]  fucking just perfect. That makes me want to go grab my acoustic guitar because that's basically
[31:43.890 --> 31:48.290]  how myself and a couple other friends learned to play guitar is through that album. Like
[31:50.690 --> 31:54.770]  like we all learned all those simple Nirvana licks. Yeah. He just learned the fucking G's
[31:54.770 --> 31:59.730]  and C's off of those songs. And then from there, yeah. I played a lot of Nirvana, uh,
[31:59.730 --> 32:03.250]  in high school and stuff on guitar. And you know, it just always stuck with me.
[32:04.130 --> 32:08.370]  I was inspired to play the drums by Lars, a big, big shout out to Neil pert real quick,
[32:08.370 --> 32:12.930]  by the way, but I was inspired to play the drums by Lars from Metallica and partly by my uncle.
[32:12.930 --> 32:19.090]  That's what inspired this question here. Um, but smells like teen spirit was the first song. I
[32:19.090 --> 32:23.410]  actually focused on learning on the drums and like accomplished and felt like I can put that on in
[32:23.410 --> 32:27.490]  the headphones and play it and sound like I'm actually playing with a band. And it smells like
[32:27.490 --> 32:31.810]  teen spirit was my first tune that I learned. So that was kind of cool. Oh yeah. So Nirvana is what
[32:31.810 --> 32:35.410]  you want to put on when you're stoned. What's the fucking song or the album that gives you the feels
[32:35.490 --> 32:41.970]  brother? Just makes you fucking get some, some tingly spine feelings. Um, let's see. Uh, where
[32:41.970 --> 32:52.450]  did you sleep last night? It was a great one. Um, like a fire. Uh, yeah, man. Um, where'd you sleep
[32:52.450 --> 32:57.570]  last night? Just all Nirvana. Yeah. Nirvana. Well, no, I was in a metal for a long time,
[32:57.570 --> 33:01.730]  mostly like Pantera and stuff like that, which I'm, you know, like cowboys from hell.
[33:01.890 --> 33:08.050]  Really loved the, uh, the vulgar display of power album was really good. I really liked the, um,
[33:08.050 --> 33:13.010]  what's after that one. That's a I'm broken's on there. I can fucking see the baby blue. And it's
[33:13.010 --> 33:16.610]  got a screw in his head. What's the name of that album, dude. I can't remember that when people
[33:16.610 --> 33:22.450]  are yelling at their fucking phone right now. It's called you asshole. It's a Pantera to the return
[33:23.890 --> 33:29.650]  electric Boogaloo Pantera. We have so many people so angry. Vinnie Paul's going to kill us.
[33:30.210 --> 33:34.930]  Oh, is he the one with I'm broken on it? Oh, is he right too soon? Uh,
[33:38.450 --> 33:41.730]  I fucking love that one. That was a good one. It was a little overproduced, but after that,
[33:41.730 --> 33:47.090]  I fell off the Pantera train. They may have also, I'm not sure. Yeah, but I love some good Pantera.
[33:47.090 --> 33:51.490]  They got that good, heavy feel. Good music. Yeah. You'd think for a reggae fan and a fish kid and a
[33:51.490 --> 33:55.090]  grateful dead fan, I wouldn't know so much about Pantera and Metallica, but that's where I came
[33:55.090 --> 34:00.370]  from. Yeah. Yeah. My uncle's put that fucking good metal vibe in my head. I just have to be
[34:00.370 --> 34:05.010]  sure I'm not driving when I'm listening to Pantera and shit like fucking speeding tickets, bro. We
[34:05.010 --> 34:09.170]  were talking about it earlier. Fucking, Hey, you put the right song on man. You're going fucking
[34:09.170 --> 34:13.170]  20 over. Yeah. I think Mike and I'm not allowed to listen to master puppets. And that's our
[34:13.170 --> 34:17.810]  fucking speeding ticket. Fucking right there. Master. Oh, I'm getting pulled over.
[34:18.610 --> 34:21.170]  The blue lights go with it. Great.
[34:27.170 --> 34:29.410]  Cops like you were fucking nailing it, but you're going one 20.
[34:31.330 --> 34:34.610]  Just a minute officer. Let's get through the chorus. Check out the drum solo.
[34:39.410 --> 34:43.410]  You getting this on your fucking body cam, sir. All right, let's move forward there.
[34:44.370 --> 34:48.370]  Mike, Mike, let's talk about, I kind of know what you like to listen to, but let's be fair and give
[34:48.370 --> 34:51.410]  you an opportunity to talk about it. What do you like to listen to when you're good in stone, bro?
[34:51.410 --> 34:56.130]  The parameters you set originally, the first song that popped into my head was Tom Petty,
[34:56.130 --> 35:01.490]  running down a dream. I was just going to hop into the car or just a little lit and pick a song
[35:02.130 --> 35:07.490]  that would be high on the list to start off the ride home. If it had to be a whole album,
[35:07.490 --> 35:13.010]  that gets harder. I was never an album guy. There was very few albums that I would put in and play
[35:13.010 --> 35:18.370]  Nirvana, unplugged anyone my age that's on the list of whole albums. So listen to
[35:19.090 --> 35:23.170]  Something about being a musician. We put on the whole album because we don't want to skip.
[35:23.170 --> 35:26.850]  We don't want to put on another disc between songs because we don't want to stop playing our
[35:26.850 --> 35:29.970]  drums or guitar. So you just press play on the album and put on your headphones and you learn
[35:29.970 --> 35:35.490]  the whole album. That's I was never an album. That's what I really dug soundtracks for a while
[35:35.490 --> 35:44.690]  because it was never like five great songs and then seven fillers. It was at least all pretty
[35:44.690 --> 35:50.450]  good. Yeah. I like that. That's cool. Makes sense. So we've got running down a dream. I hear some
[35:50.450 --> 35:56.290]  Tom Petty in my head now. I'll drive this bucket on that song that started off so many drives in
[35:56.290 --> 36:00.130]  my life. That's way off of what I would have expected you to tell. So if you're not driving
[36:00.130 --> 36:03.250]  then what else are you going to listen to? What else are you down to? I want you to say that.
[36:03.250 --> 36:08.450]  It's pretty eclectic. You always give me shit for 311, which is totally fair because I've probably
[36:08.450 --> 36:13.490]  seen them in concert 20 times over my life. They were the last band I saw in concert if that's the
[36:13.490 --> 36:19.650]  question. They were not the first, but they were one of the first that as an adult, it wasn't like
[36:19.650 --> 36:23.570]  I can't count the Beach Boys concert that I went to when I was eight because that wasn't a conscious
[36:23.570 --> 36:30.210]  choice I made. That wasn't a stylistic statement about me. I mean, maybe Boys to Men when I was
[36:30.370 --> 36:36.690]  14. That was all me and my brother being like, dude, you have to take us or we will fucking
[36:36.690 --> 36:42.930]  ruin your summer. Dude, that would be fun. Montel Jordan, Missy Elliott and Boys to Men for the two
[36:42.930 --> 36:49.970]  tour at Fiddler's, I believe. That kind of counts. And then 311 was the first one that I was like,
[36:49.970 --> 36:53.250]  no, I worked for this money. I'm spending this money how I want and going to 311 at
[36:53.810 --> 37:02.370]  Red Rocks or the Ogden or the Fillmore. There's so many, but there's some electronic in there.
[37:02.370 --> 37:06.690]  If I had to pick a whole album to listen to, Happy to be Hardcore Volume 3 would be on there.
[37:09.890 --> 37:13.330]  That's part of my life that I probably haven't shared with you at all because you're a fucking
[37:13.330 --> 37:17.810]  fish head. I feel like we did different drugs in college. We did very different drugs in college
[37:18.610 --> 37:22.450]  or in the time when you could have been in college. Yeah, I wasn't in college, but I was
[37:22.850 --> 37:27.490]  you were in the band when I was in college, but you lived on one kind of.
[37:30.290 --> 37:36.530]  No country in my repertoire, some metal, but not like a ton. Ramstein's in there a little bit. If
[37:36.530 --> 37:43.250]  I've got to go for like top metal for a while, that album that hit big here in the States was
[37:43.250 --> 37:46.850]  one of the albums that I would listen to. It was one of the only ones I had with me when I went to
[37:46.850 --> 37:52.210]  France the first time when Discman's were a thing. I would put it on, listen to the first
[37:52.210 --> 37:57.490]  track and then fall asleep on the tour bus and wake up three hours later wherever we were headed,
[37:57.490 --> 38:01.810]  like having listened to all of it in my sleep and absorbed lots of angry German metal.
[38:01.810 --> 38:04.210]  Did yours have the bass boost button? It did.
[38:05.490 --> 38:10.370]  The thing that swore it would not skip for 30 seconds, but that was a fucking lie.
[38:11.250 --> 38:14.690]  Because you would have to wait 30 seconds for it to play if it really worked like that, right?
[38:14.690 --> 38:19.090]  Wouldn't you have to be 30 seconds behind? I know the science behind it, but it's not fun.
[38:19.090 --> 38:24.610]  No, I know. I know better. It's reading faster. I get it. But still, my brain goes,
[38:24.610 --> 38:28.930]  you've got to get a 30 second head start. Yeah. Yeah. Jeff.
[38:29.810 --> 38:33.490]  I don't watch TV shows on TV ever because I want to fast forward through the commercials. I will
[38:33.490 --> 38:37.010]  wait 10 minutes for that show to be fucking 10 minutes late just so I don't have to watch any
[38:37.010 --> 38:41.730]  commercials. All right. So Mike, your music is very eclectic, bro. Very eclectic.
[38:41.730 --> 38:45.330]  Lately, there's been a lot of rise against, but I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's
[38:45.330 --> 38:48.930]  because I really like it or because I really fucking miss Rage Against the Machine.
[38:49.730 --> 38:53.410]  Wow. That's a good thing. I think we can all agree on Rage Against the Machine at this table.
[38:53.410 --> 38:58.610]  I can't believe they're fucking hitting tour dates, but I'm not rich and can't take
[38:59.330 --> 39:03.730]  flying across the country to go see a 700-minute concert kind of trip right now.
[39:03.730 --> 39:07.170]  So what gives you some kind of feels? What song, every time you hear it, you go, ah.
[39:07.490 --> 39:11.490]  There's too many to pick one. I've listed off many.
[39:11.490 --> 39:15.410]  Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, then this one should be easy and we're just going to start
[39:15.410 --> 39:19.330]  with you again and work our way back around. I figure if we're going to talk about music,
[39:19.890 --> 39:25.810]  we should also talk about movies. Every stoner likes a good fucking stoner movie, right? It
[39:25.810 --> 39:29.570]  doesn't have to be a stoner movie, but what do you like to get stoned and just lay around and
[39:29.570 --> 39:32.370]  watch a movie? What movie are you going to fucking put on? What's one of your favorite movies?
[39:33.090 --> 39:35.410]  He's really thinking, you guys. You can put a fucking egg on his head.
[39:35.410 --> 39:40.210]  I don't have favorites like this, like that. If you had to pick five for a fucking desert island,
[39:40.210 --> 39:43.330]  I'm like, okay, when I finish the fifth one, I'm shooting myself. You know,
[39:43.330 --> 39:47.010]  that's how this ends, right? Because if I can't take them all, fuck that.
[39:50.050 --> 39:53.810]  But right now it would probably be something out of Kevin Smith's library.
[39:53.810 --> 39:56.930]  Okay, cool. Then I'm going to make you watch Tusk all the time.
[39:56.930 --> 40:00.690]  God damn it. You got to pick that one. It can't be fucking Cop Out or one of the other ones.
[40:00.930 --> 40:04.850]  It's got to be fucking Tusk. You made me do it, bro. What about Red State? I'll watch that shit a
[40:04.850 --> 40:09.250]  couple of times in a row. I don't know that you have Red State. But I was thinking more like
[40:09.250 --> 40:14.610]  clerk's tour, strike back. You're going to watch Jersey girl. I'm pissed at this one that
[40:16.210 --> 40:21.090]  reboot didn't get released nationally. That he's touring at roadshow till it hits DVD and I have
[40:21.090 --> 40:25.490]  to fucking wait. Mike's a big Kevin Smith nerd. If you haven't caught on, he does see Kevin Smith
[40:25.490 --> 40:29.330]  at a live show one time and it was a good fucking time. Yeah, it's a nice little show. It's a good
[40:29.730 --> 40:33.970]  nice little show. Front row even. I'm glad that happened. I was excited for that. Thank you, bro.
[40:33.970 --> 40:39.010]  All right. So Mike wants to see Kevin Smith stuff. Mike just wants to meet and greet and hang out with
[40:39.010 --> 40:42.690]  Kevin Smith and be his homie for the rest of his life. He even smokes weed now. It's going to
[40:42.690 --> 40:47.730]  fucking happen. Fat man and beyond. Our worlds are slowly inching towards each other. We'll do
[40:47.730 --> 40:53.090]  podcasting and we'll get there. All right, Matt. What movies do you like to like? What kind of
[40:53.090 --> 40:58.210]  movies do you like to watch? What's your favorite movie when you're all stoned? I like Paul recently.
[40:59.330 --> 41:04.690]  I know that's, I don't know why I fucking choice though. It's underestimated. I think, I don't know.
[41:04.690 --> 41:09.010]  People don't talk about it much, but it was a great fucking movie. Random movies get random
[41:09.010 --> 41:16.050]  people. Shit. You know, Simon Pegg and um, yeah. Oh, what's that Seth? That's the alien one. Seth.
[41:16.930 --> 41:23.490]  It's not Rogan or green. God damn it. Um, oh, now you fucking fucked up my brain. I messed him up.
[41:23.490 --> 41:29.010]  Oh shit. Are you guys asking if Seth Rogen is the one that's in the alien movie? Yeah. Oh yeah.
[41:29.570 --> 41:34.210]  Okay. Yeah. I got super high and was hearing Joe and not Seth. I keep seeing
[41:34.210 --> 41:37.810]  fucking Seth green's face in my head knowing that that's the wrong person. Not able to say
[41:37.810 --> 41:42.850]  Seth Rogen now. That's funny. And an alien I'm in for that shit for sure. And I wanted
[41:42.850 --> 41:47.170]  Seth Rogen to be an alien suddenly or Seth green to be an alien. Now I was listening to Joe Rogan
[41:47.170 --> 41:51.490]  on the way over here and I kept seeing like you were saying Seth Rogen and I was like Joe Rogen,
[41:51.490 --> 41:54.770]  no, not the dude with the podcast. That'd be Jar Jar Binks by the way, if that happened.
[41:54.770 --> 41:59.890]  Seth Rogen as an alien would be Jar Jar Binks. That's right. Yeah. Oh yeah, man. But, um,
[42:00.610 --> 42:07.890]  I don't know. I like a lot of different stuff, dude. Uh, I guess, um, a lot of like scary stuff,
[42:07.890 --> 42:12.770]  insidious, the whole insidious series. One of those guys, huh? Yeah. I like to get really
[42:12.770 --> 42:16.770]  baked and then scared the shit out of myself. My apartment start hearing noise. Yeah. I love
[42:16.770 --> 42:20.130]  that. You gotta go like fucking make sure no, is that any of the other rooms and shit? The
[42:20.130 --> 42:25.890]  ice maker drops in a shit. My pants. Yeah. I love those. Love those. Nice. You're a twisted
[42:25.890 --> 42:29.810]  individual. I like it. All right, Clint. It is time for you. I hope you've done some thought.
[42:29.810 --> 42:32.610]  What's one of your favorite movies to watch when you're all stone, bro? Um,
[42:34.370 --> 42:39.170]  you know, I just blanked on it. I it's like you're on Doug loves movies. Yeah,
[42:39.170 --> 42:45.250]  seriously. This is pretty bad. Clint. Um, I really had a good answer to, I was excited to tell you,
[42:45.250 --> 42:49.090]  you want to pen and then I'll talk and then you write it down or I'll just talk. And when you
[42:49.090 --> 42:53.250]  think about it, you fucking blurt it out. Just upset with myself. No, I'm upset with you too.
[42:53.250 --> 42:57.490]  You're, you were on a roll and I really enjoyed half baked. That was a good movie. That's a good
[42:57.490 --> 43:00.450]  one. Is that what you're going to say? Are you just finding a cop out now? No, I just got to
[43:00.450 --> 43:03.410]  move past it. All right. Well I'll talk for a minute. And then if you think of it, you just
[43:03.410 --> 43:09.170]  yell, don't be shy. Um, a very long time ago I had a friend named Sam and Sam had a house,
[43:09.170 --> 43:14.530]  you know, when you're, um, 16, 17, sometimes you need a place where you go get fucked up.
[43:14.530 --> 43:19.410]  Do it. Do it. Clint. Thank you brother. Hey, uh, so my favorite was, uh, I just watched
[43:19.410 --> 43:26.130]  Mandalorian. It's a series on Disney plus and it's eight episodes and I got to put that over.
[43:26.130 --> 43:31.810]  It was fantastic. There was one episode I was on the edge of my seat. I would never,
[43:32.690 --> 43:37.970]  that is sin. I would just put it over. It's just saying, Hey, it's worth the like eight hours
[43:37.970 --> 43:43.410]  overall. It's not like super long. It's really well done. I'm just, I don't know. I watched it.
[43:43.490 --> 43:47.250]  It was excellent. I feel like that's a cop out because you answered with the series
[43:47.970 --> 43:52.370]  and mine would have been narcos. Yeah. Doug Benson wouldn't allow it. Well then we'll maybe
[43:52.370 --> 43:58.290]  then. Okay. Mike, let's hear about your favorite goddamn series. I want a movie. I'm just going
[43:58.290 --> 44:04.290]  to put that over. He said half baked. He's cool. He said, I got two of them now. I got two. Dang,
[44:04.290 --> 44:09.090]  this ain't Doug loves movies. I'm going to let it slide. There's no prize bag. Okay. Jeff loves
[44:09.090 --> 44:16.450]  clinch. Judge is cool with it. Jeff loves dabbing. So I, uh, that I'm going to have to
[44:16.450 --> 44:19.810]  check that out. A lot of people have, I see baby Yoda, the Mandalorian, the baby Yoda,
[44:19.810 --> 44:24.210]  Mandalorian. That's all social media talks about it's butts, drums, weed, and baby Yoda. That's
[44:24.210 --> 44:27.890]  all. It's on my fucking Instagram. Interesting. Instagram feed. It's beautiful, bro. What else
[44:27.890 --> 44:33.010]  could you ask for? Buts, drums, weed, and baby Yoda working for me. I don't know, man. It was
[44:33.010 --> 44:37.410]  excellent. I think a lot of people are going to agree. It just was well done. I'm not a huge star
[44:37.490 --> 44:42.690]  Wars guy. I'm still loving it. I've seen all the movies, but never like in depth. I've never
[44:42.690 --> 44:49.010]  watched them. I've probably seen at the most couple of times each and that would be a stretch
[44:49.890 --> 44:55.650]  and I just, that series is so well done. They really established really good characters. And
[44:55.650 --> 45:00.050]  I know the writing was really well done. The videography is well done. I don't know. I just
[45:00.050 --> 45:05.570]  got to keep putting it over Disney. You can send your check to tall Clint. That's true. Thank you.
[45:06.530 --> 45:12.450]  Hashtag ad. There we go. Positive energy. Um, so a very long time ago, I was talking about that
[45:12.450 --> 45:15.730]  time period, like when you're fresh out of high school or you might even still be in high school
[45:15.730 --> 45:19.090]  and you just need that place. You can go party sometimes. And everybody's got the one friend
[45:19.090 --> 45:23.970]  whose parents just don't give a fuck. You can do whatever you want at that house. And so I found
[45:23.970 --> 45:29.010]  that house and I went there one night and we may or may have not have eaten a little bit too much
[45:29.010 --> 45:35.730]  LSD. And we possibly may have watched dazed and confused and half baked and Billy Madison on a VHS
[45:35.730 --> 45:41.010]  tape. That's how old I am. You guys VHS. And we would watch it and we were tripping. And when it
[45:41.010 --> 45:44.610]  ended, we were like, just fucking rewind it and do it again. Cause I don't know what else to do.
[45:44.610 --> 45:48.530]  So the whole crew sat on the couch all night. And I think we watched the whole videotape three times
[45:48.530 --> 45:53.810]  in a row, probably just in the course of this acid trip. And those, I can almost quote most of
[45:53.810 --> 45:57.570]  the lines from dazed and confused. That is one of my favorite movies. And then in the future,
[45:57.570 --> 46:01.010]  in my life, if you've listened to the podcast, I ended up meeting somebody who's in that movie and
[46:01.010 --> 46:04.130]  it become pretty damn good friends with that person. So that's kind of cool. But dazed and
[46:04.130 --> 46:09.010]  confused has always been one of my favorite movies. Um, I just fell in. I knew I loved it
[46:09.010 --> 46:12.210]  before I had acid and watched it like eight times. I always knew it was going to be one of my
[46:12.210 --> 46:16.850]  favorites. Just a good stoner movie. That's a great movie. Yeah. Friday is a good stoner movie.
[46:16.850 --> 46:21.170]  Half baked is a good one. Billy Madison will always have a spot in my heart. Um, yeah, I'm
[46:21.170 --> 46:25.570]  not a huge movie buff. That's never been one of my things, but those are a few of the good movies
[46:25.570 --> 46:31.570]  that I really enjoyed. Yeah. Fear and loathing in Las Vegas is also awesome. That is a great one.
[46:31.570 --> 46:36.530]  Also, Mike kind of shook his head like, that's when I never got it. Like every one of my friends
[46:36.530 --> 46:41.010]  loves that movie and I've watched it several times and just been like, like I get it, but I
[46:41.010 --> 46:45.570]  guess I'm on the wrong drugs. Yeah. I was going to say, I didn't want to elaborate too much on
[46:45.570 --> 46:49.650]  your business, but you never seem to be the one that's into the psychedelic or psychedelia. That's
[46:49.650 --> 46:54.770]  not your type of stuff. And I think it's because you are, you know, about psychology and you want
[46:54.770 --> 46:59.330]  to not fuck up your psychology and you're worried about it. And I'm over here, not too aware of
[46:59.330 --> 47:02.770]  what's going on in my brain. I was like some acid, let's put it in there and see what it does.
[47:02.770 --> 47:08.610]  And so that you allegedly, well, back in the day, I used to go to fish shows and eat too much acid.
[47:08.610 --> 47:12.610]  I'm okay with people knowing that's a thing. Uh, but you see things differently and you're
[47:12.610 --> 47:18.690]  into different shit. Once you've fucking opened that portal, I can tell you about them. I talked
[47:18.690 --> 47:22.930]  to people that did them and I was like, I don't want to take it for that ride. Like I'm gonna get
[47:22.930 --> 47:28.050]  on a different ride. That sounds more fun. Well, I've been to Las Vegas like three times, man.
[47:28.050 --> 47:32.850]  And I used to go around like old Las Vegas and just like, after seeing the movie, you know,
[47:32.850 --> 47:37.250]  you just want to trip your ass off and fuck go to circus circus. It's fucking kind of fun.
[47:37.810 --> 47:40.770]  So you're just trying to live the dream. Just did your feet stick to the tar, the carpet? Like
[47:40.770 --> 47:46.530]  there's no, honestly, I just got really fucked up and I know I really don't remember a lot.
[47:48.050 --> 47:51.170]  That's fucking awesome. Vegas. There are a few fish shows where I'm kind of like, huh,
[47:51.170 --> 47:54.690]  I wish I would've remembered more of that show. Yeah. That was an expensive memory loss. Heard
[47:54.690 --> 48:00.770]  that was a good time. I have to listen to the recording. Um, so, uh, did I get everybody's
[48:00.770 --> 48:04.290]  movies? Yeah, we got everybody's movies, right? Yeah. I talked about my movies. Clint came back
[48:04.290 --> 48:07.250]  to his I'm stoned. You guys, if you can't tell him, I'm going to take a dab here pretty soon
[48:07.250 --> 48:11.170]  because I could be, it's about dad 30 stoned or the word I can be stoned or Matt's over there
[48:11.170 --> 48:16.850]  packing a bowl. He's got the right idea. Um, let's see. He's packing a bowl. This is a good
[48:16.850 --> 48:22.290]  way to segue into this. Uh, 2019 just passed. We're at the start of 2020 here. I'm glad I got
[48:22.290 --> 48:25.490]  the year right. Cause I said it wrong on a previous episode and it made me feel like shit.
[48:25.490 --> 48:30.450]  Um, we were at the start of a new year, just wrapped up an old year episode 500. This is a
[48:30.450 --> 48:37.090]  good time to talk about, uh, strains of 2019. Did any strain stand out to you guys in 2019? Or what
[48:37.090 --> 48:43.170]  was the winning strain for you last year? Matt's laughing. Go for it. Did you fucking win with your
[48:43.170 --> 48:49.330]  goddamn, uh, baby shit smelling dabs over there? That's the winner. Yeah. I don't think that's the
[48:49.330 --> 48:58.290]  winner. God damn. It stands out. You can fucking have it if you find it. No, no. I don't find it
[48:58.290 --> 49:02.370]  like, you know, as one I want to smoke, but it's definitely the most unique strain. Have you
[49:02.370 --> 49:08.210]  smelled this yet? Clint? Let's go. Let's go. My nose doesn't work. Just tell the mic what you smell.
[49:08.210 --> 49:11.410]  Yeah. Your nose is a little off, but yeah, my nose doesn't work that well guys. All right.
[49:12.290 --> 49:16.530]  Yeah. It's, I mean, it's something. Um, I'm going to give it. It doesn't work like that.
[49:16.530 --> 49:19.650]  Y'all let you guys in the room talk about the aromas. You go ahead, Matt, you know,
[49:19.650 --> 49:22.450]  you've talked about what it smells like, and then I'll give you my description at the end.
[49:22.450 --> 49:30.130]  Um, it is, it is like a, like a baby shit next to you, um, in a restaurant and you're just like, wow.
[49:31.010 --> 49:35.570]  Um, yeah, that's definitely baby shit. It's a diaper duty. Yeah. And you know,
[49:35.570 --> 49:40.290]  you kind of get some of that diaper. It has a diaper genie ask funk to it.
[49:40.930 --> 49:48.290]  I described it as, um, a medium sized dog took a dump in the lawn, but it's a lawn with grass about,
[49:48.290 --> 49:54.050]  um, an inch tall and it's in the shade. So there's plenty of moisture, but the outer layer
[49:54.050 --> 49:58.690]  of the dog turd has hardened and become dark. But then you ran it over with the lawnmower and broke
[49:58.690 --> 50:04.130]  it open. And that splatter middle moist poop smell that comes out real strong and punches you in the
[50:04.130 --> 50:09.330]  face. And you almost have to like scrape it off your tongue. He'll go, Oh, I think that's what
[50:09.330 --> 50:13.810]  that smells like. And I'm not exactly sure why I bought it. I think I was curious. I was like,
[50:13.810 --> 50:19.650]  that smells terrible. I want to take a dab of that. And then I dabbed it and that dog turd terp.
[50:20.610 --> 50:24.370]  Oh, you don't want to dab that. I apologize. I'm not even going to say what it is or where it came
[50:24.370 --> 50:27.890]  from. We don't even need to talk about that. But if you go to the dispensary and you get the one
[50:27.890 --> 50:32.610]  that smells like a hot dog shit, uh, just skip it. That's my advice. Oh man.
[50:34.370 --> 50:38.770]  You know, weird turps have been in lately, but that's one. I just, I, I don't know.
[50:40.290 --> 50:45.410]  Is not on my palate. You know, we'll go funky garlic body odor smell all day, you know,
[50:45.410 --> 50:49.010]  but I think that one's on a no fly list. Yeah. Stay above the waist.
[50:50.370 --> 50:54.290]  All right. So now let's get real, bro. Let's get real. Uh, because man, if that's your
[50:54.290 --> 50:59.250]  strange choice for the year, you've got issues. Well, no, no. I mean, that's like the most like
[50:59.250 --> 51:04.370]  standout one that I think I've come across in the year, as far as like just things that just kind
[51:04.370 --> 51:09.970]  of blew my mind as to why does this exist? All right. Um, yeah. Why does that exist? That smells
[51:09.970 --> 51:14.770]  so fucking miserable. I got to wonder about the grower who like had that Fino come out and then
[51:14.770 --> 51:21.650]  just was like, Oh man, fucking yes. You know, like I just got to wonder what that guy, if he's like
[51:21.650 --> 51:25.570]  the guy who like scratches his ass and then just, you know, he gets a whiff every once in a while
[51:25.570 --> 51:30.290]  or something and he just enjoys that. I don't know, man. I don't remember growing up. I don't
[51:30.290 --> 51:33.170]  know. I was going to say like, there are people out in the world that like black
[51:33.170 --> 51:37.170]  licorice. Like it could just be one of those things. But I really think that was
[51:38.610 --> 51:41.810]  something that they grew and were like, well, we're not throwing it away. Cause we don't waste
[51:41.810 --> 51:49.010]  stuff here, process it. And like whoever buys it, like, I'm sorry. But we, we need our seven 58 gram
[51:49.010 --> 51:54.290]  wholesale or we can't survive. So I'll tell you what, it makes a great gag, uh, flavor.
[51:55.090 --> 52:01.330]  You want to be stoned? So this guy won't leave that. It got me really, really stoned.
[52:01.970 --> 52:06.210]  Like, like I was like, I get high off of most of the concentrates, but it made me like droopy,
[52:06.210 --> 52:13.090]  like more I'm stone. Yeah. It wasn't bad as far as like good flavors, uh, good strains this year.
[52:13.090 --> 52:20.850]  Um, I think, uh, GMO man, just says it's just been popping all year and everybody who's put
[52:20.850 --> 52:24.770]  it out has done an excellent job. I've been in love with that garlic turd, bro. That's killing
[52:24.770 --> 52:31.810]  it. GMO real quick. GMO doesn't mean garlic mushroom onions, uh, from the, to the best of
[52:31.810 --> 52:35.890]  my knowledge. Here's what I know about GMO. We got way sidetracked, but you said that a lot of
[52:35.890 --> 52:40.370]  people have the wrong idea of what GMO, why it's called that GMO. It's not a genetically modified
[52:40.370 --> 52:45.810]  strain. It's not garlic mushroom onions. I think it's a chem four and girl scout cookies. It's a
[52:45.810 --> 52:50.530]  chem cookies cross. I think that's correct from, I'm just trying to go from memory here. Uh, a guy
[52:50.530 --> 52:55.970]  named skunk master flex called it GMO. It's a phenotype that he found in a pack of seeds and he
[52:55.970 --> 53:00.770]  called it GMO because it's got girl scout cookies in there and it smells really crazy. It's got a
[53:00.770 --> 53:06.370]  chemical funky smell to it. At that time, the girl scout cookies organization was under scrutiny
[53:06.370 --> 53:11.490]  because it was discovered that their cookies were being made with ridiculous GMO products.
[53:11.490 --> 53:16.610]  So girl scout cookies, girl scout cookies were popular. The GMO thing came up in the news.
[53:16.610 --> 53:21.810]  That strain smelled really funky. Let's put the word GMO on that cross. That's how GMO got that
[53:21.810 --> 53:25.650]  name. That's why it's called that. So that may clear up a bunch of crazy, weird rumors and
[53:25.650 --> 53:29.170]  bullshit on the internet. And that's what this podcast was designed for. But dude, I totally
[53:29.170 --> 53:33.330]  agree with you that the GMO is fucking awesome. That garlic turf, that fucking earthy savory
[53:33.330 --> 53:37.650]  thing. I've been talking about garlic mashed potatoes dabs for like since fucking the summer.
[53:37.650 --> 53:43.170]  And I love it, dude. Garlic banger, anything with that garlic fucking, yeah. Savory turps.
[53:43.410 --> 53:47.650]  Yeah. It's addictive, man. Yeah. You just want, and the buzz from it is beautiful. It's like
[53:47.650 --> 53:51.890]  a nice body buzz and a face high. Something about that garlic turp gives you a nice high.
[53:52.530 --> 53:57.010]  That's one of those you can't stop smelling in your yard, even though you don't want to crack it.
[53:57.010 --> 54:00.850]  They never have more at the dispensary because I've talked too much about the garlic turps. So
[54:00.850 --> 54:07.490]  it always sells out. All the garlicky shit goes quickly. Yeah. Clint, you're new, bro. So you
[54:07.490 --> 54:12.050]  haven't had as much experience throughout the years to see the hype and the strain hype and
[54:12.050 --> 54:17.570]  popularity, but did anything stand out for you in 2019 strain wise? No, man, I've just been kind
[54:17.570 --> 54:22.370]  of smoking all the homegrow stuff. So it's been like, I'm not paying attention to anything in
[54:22.370 --> 54:26.290]  stores or anything. I love that you're a, just kind of your own stoner in your own stoner bubble.
[54:26.290 --> 54:29.810]  You're not like over here trying to be hyped up with everybody, just doing the Clint thing. And
[54:29.810 --> 54:34.530]  he smoked some weed sometimes. I think that's the best way to be. You just gotta be yourself and not
[54:34.530 --> 54:38.530]  really follow a whole bunch of trends. Most people aren't even good at being themselves yet.
[54:38.530 --> 54:43.970]  Yeah. You know, that's ego, man. That's the first thing you get rid of. Then you start being
[54:43.970 --> 54:50.450]  yourself. There you go. Keep smoking what you're smoking. It's working. I think so. Mike. Gelato
[54:50.450 --> 54:55.730]  was everywhere last year. Gelato was everywhere. That is for sure. Bless you, Mike. Bless you. I
[54:55.730 --> 54:58.690]  had a strain in mind that I was going to talk about and it just left my head. So I hope somebody
[54:58.690 --> 55:04.210]  else keeps talking. It seemed like at the start of the year, it was cookies, everything. And then
[55:04.210 --> 55:08.050]  you went to the store one day and they were like, no, it's gelato. Now pick one. And it's like,
[55:08.050 --> 55:15.810]  all right. If that's the new thing, frosty one. Was it your peach smash record? Your peach record
[55:15.810 --> 55:19.890]  seemed like you were getting pretty hype on it. I took a dab of that peach record a minute ago and
[55:19.890 --> 55:26.130]  everybody in the room made this face up. Oh, that smells really good. Yeah. Yeah. The strains that
[55:26.130 --> 55:32.370]  I noticed for 2019 were of course the Mac, the fucking Mac was everywhere. Shout out to Jaren
[55:32.370 --> 55:36.930]  for growing the fuck out of the Mac. Shout out to the Green Dot crew for making some amazing Mac
[55:36.930 --> 55:41.890]  concentrates. They made some Mac pens, some Mac carts. I'm actually going to grab a couple of Mac
[55:41.890 --> 55:47.010]  carts. We've got a little adventure coming up. We'll have a Mac cart for that adventure. So we
[55:47.010 --> 55:51.330]  can get nice and light. Some Mac cart adventure. Yeah. The Miracle Alien cookies. It's been
[55:51.330 --> 55:55.090]  everywhere. Everybody's been breeding to it. Everybody's been working with it. I've grown it.
[55:55.090 --> 56:00.450]  I've smoked it. That was one of the most popular for 2019, which is amazing. It's got a nice story
[56:00.450 --> 56:05.890]  behind it. The breeder is super popular and a lot of hype for that one. Also the GMO, like you said,
[56:06.130 --> 56:10.450]  the GMO was one of my favorites for the year. Then I would be silly if I didn't talk about
[56:11.250 --> 56:16.930]  some things that really surprised me. Strawberry fucking Starburst. Strawberry Starburst has blown
[56:16.930 --> 56:22.850]  up this year. That's been the strain of the year for me other than a rise, which is always my most
[56:22.850 --> 56:27.490]  popular, but Strawberry Starburst really took off. People are making amazing concentrates,
[56:27.490 --> 56:33.570]  amazing photos. It's amazing smoke, amazing harvest weights. I've been getting major
[56:33.570 --> 56:37.170]  reports on Strawberry Starburst. It's been fucking impressive. So yeah, that's the one that
[56:37.170 --> 56:41.010]  kind of blew me away this year. I didn't expect it. It came out of nowhere. It was just one of my
[56:41.970 --> 56:45.650]  favorites, but not my top, like, ooh, can't live without that one. But then it just fucking
[56:45.650 --> 56:50.210]  expanded up quickly. That's super killing it. So the strawberry is one that blew me out of the
[56:50.210 --> 56:55.170]  water. What do you guys see coming up for 2020? Do you guys have any predictions, any strains,
[56:55.170 --> 57:00.370]  any flavors, any trends in cannabis that you see for 2020? Everybody just shook their heads.
[57:00.610 --> 57:05.410]  It's funny. I see a lot of now and later crosses coming out. Yeah. A lot of that now and later,
[57:05.410 --> 57:10.610]  the mochi gelato type of crosses. I also see a lot of people going back toward the cheesy sort
[57:10.610 --> 57:16.930]  of stuff. That's another strain that I see a lot of hype based on. Also skunk is making a comeback.
[57:16.930 --> 57:21.570]  I've seen a few people trying to bring skunk back. It's funny because skunk and cheese are the same
[57:21.570 --> 57:26.290]  thing, just phenotypes of the same lineage. Yeah. That's the skunk and the cheese. It's the same
[57:26.290 --> 57:30.450]  thing basically. You just get a real cheesy phenotype of the skunk or a real skunky phenotype
[57:30.450 --> 57:34.850]  of the skunk. That's fucking... Yeah. So we're going to see skunky cheesy stuff. I really like
[57:34.850 --> 57:39.410]  the way that a lot of the concentrate companies are kind of making their connoisseur blends.
[57:39.410 --> 57:45.810]  They're doing their own flavor, their own style. And Green Dot Lab seems to have a nice thing going
[57:45.810 --> 57:50.050]  on. They got the cherry, they got the peach, they've got the mimosa, the dosis of mimosas.
[57:50.050 --> 57:53.970]  They've got a nice thing going on with their blends. Apothecary's got a lot of nice blends
[57:53.970 --> 57:58.050]  going on. I like the way that the individual companies are making their own connoisseur
[57:58.050 --> 58:01.410]  styles. That's making it really nice. I see a lot of great flavors come out of there.
[58:01.970 --> 58:06.770]  Each brand has sort of a flavor that catches on. Everybody knows about Apothecary's Clementine. We
[58:06.770 --> 58:10.930]  all know that that's fucking hot fire. Everybody knows. There are a couple from fucking Green Dot
[58:10.930 --> 58:14.370]  that we could talk about, but everybody knows that each company's got that one or two that
[58:14.370 --> 58:18.050]  stands out. And I love that that sort of stuff is coming up and that I'm able to find it where
[58:18.050 --> 58:23.730]  I am. That's also something I love. But I see more of the skunky stuff. And then I see more
[58:24.050 --> 58:28.050]  connoisseur blends coming out. Things like the doses and mimosas and stuff like that are going
[58:28.050 --> 58:32.930]  to keep killing it. Those custom blends that they're making. I've talked about in the future,
[58:32.930 --> 58:38.930]  we're going to be able to talk about what we like. You basically fucking tell a guy behind a counter
[58:38.930 --> 58:42.930]  or maybe a computer that this is what I like. And then you press buttons and then it spits out
[58:42.930 --> 58:49.410]  a Slurpee that is concentrate. It's 5% this, 6% this. I think that's where we were headed at the
[58:49.410 --> 58:55.650]  start of last year. It's the start of 2019. But I think we took a hard turn away from that about
[58:55.650 --> 59:02.850]  halfway through the year with the bait prices shit. The market shrank by like 80% across the
[59:02.850 --> 59:08.770]  country. A lot of the companies that were heavily moving that way have shifted back
[59:11.090 --> 59:15.730]  into other products, different types of concentrates away from the pens and the cartridges.
[59:16.370 --> 59:20.850]  I think one day I'll have a card, just like my ATM card that I stick into a machine,
[59:20.850 --> 59:24.530]  or maybe it'll be my fucking retina. I'll look into this machine. It'll scan my retina and I'll
[59:24.530 --> 59:28.930]  go, oh, what's up Rasta Jeff? Are you here for your concentrate refill? And I'll go, yes, I am.
[59:28.930 --> 59:32.530]  I'll go, do you need your daytime, your afternoon, or your nighttime refill? And I'll go, yes,
[59:32.530 --> 59:36.210]  please. And I'll press a button. It'll give me all three. It'll spit out three little containers
[59:36.210 --> 59:41.090]  that have got a perfect mix of what I asked for. This much THC, this much limonene, this much
[59:41.090 --> 59:44.770]  mercine, whatever, you know what I mean? And each jar, they'll be labeled exactly for me,
[59:44.770 --> 59:49.090]  Jeff's daytime, evening, nighttime medicines. I think we'll all be able to get our own custom
[59:49.090 --> 59:53.650]  Slurpee blend in the future. It'll be kind of neat. So in the back of somewhere, instead of
[59:53.650 --> 59:58.610]  having the fucking Coke dispenser that goes, and it spits out the syrup, there'll just be a bunch
[59:58.610 --> 01:00:02.450]  of cannabinoids and terpenes and all the other compounds that go into our dabs. They'll just be
[01:00:02.450 --> 01:00:05.890]  chilling out in the back in a bunch of bulk. And then you got to just mix them up in small
[01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:10.130]  quantities and spit them out in grand portions for us. That's the future, you guys. That's
[01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:14.290]  the Jetsons of dabbing. I just want a place that's going to have quality flour on the shelf
[01:00:14.290 --> 01:00:19.650]  week after week. Isn't that a struggle? We live in a state that it is completely legal. We've got
[01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:24.210]  commercial grows on every fucking block. If you go to the right area, there are a lot of commercial
[01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:29.010]  grows, if you know what to look for. And we still have a cannabis shortage here. There's not quality
[01:00:29.010 --> 01:00:35.330]  cannabis on the top shelf in every dispensary all the time. It's not a fully open market yet. It's
[01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:42.770]  still like half the places are vertically integrated or trying to be. The other half,
[01:00:42.770 --> 01:00:47.090]  they're wholesaler didn't have what they normally do. So their order got switched up and shorted.
[01:00:48.130 --> 01:00:52.450]  It's just watching it all settle out. Don't get me wrong. It's been a lot of fun. And every time
[01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:57.410]  I get down on our local market, I just get online and check out what life is like in Pennsylvania
[01:00:57.410 --> 01:01:04.370]  right now. I shut the fuck up for six months, but yeah. Well, Mike, that's a good segue. We've been
[01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:09.170]  doing a lot of great shows. We're at 500 episodes. 500. It's amazing. Christmas. Congratulations.
[01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:11.570]  Thank you, bro. Thank you guys for coming for 500. Also, that means a lot to me.
[01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:17.250]  Christmas just passed and I really considered getting you a recording device so that we can do
[01:01:17.250 --> 01:01:21.650]  your little rants because people love you being on the show, but with the new situation with the
[01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:27.090]  two kids and the new living situation, life kicks your ass quite often. And you're not able to get
[01:01:27.090 --> 01:01:31.890]  over here and smoke a cigarette, smoke a dab and then record and then fucking hang out and be bros
[01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:36.290]  and then get back home. I think we need to get you a little recording device. The amount of grief
[01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:44.290]  I took leaving today was brutal. The wife was like, no, I got you. Go have fun. Both kids were
[01:01:44.290 --> 01:01:52.050]  like, fuck that. No, you ain't leaving. No, you can't leave. Stay daddy. Stay dad. Dude, it was
[01:01:52.050 --> 01:01:55.410]  fucking brutal. You got to go home with some cookies or something, bro. You got to go home
[01:01:55.410 --> 01:02:00.610]  with prizes. The phone's off. I don't know what happened to bedtime. Did it go smooth? Was it
[01:02:00.610 --> 01:02:05.170]  world war three? I'll find out when I get home. Ouch. Scary. So we got to get you a little recording
[01:02:05.170 --> 01:02:08.770]  device, bro. That's a good idea. Just put some stuff onto a disc and then fucking email it to
[01:02:08.770 --> 01:02:13.090]  figure out how to Skype me in or something. Well, if you record it onto a disc and just send me the
[01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:16.130]  disc, I'll put it into a show and we'll put you on there. We could have little Mike's moments,
[01:02:16.130 --> 01:02:22.930]  some Mike's rants moments with Mike. It's it's anything's possible, man. 2020 is going to be a
[01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:28.530]  good year. Yeah, it is. I look forward to it. So if you guys want me to do rants for the show,
[01:02:28.530 --> 01:02:32.290]  fucking tweet me and encourage me. That'll get me to do it. And I'll buy the recording device.
[01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:37.090]  I'll get something. I'll buy it. It's a good time to plug Patreon. Patreon. There you go. You guys,
[01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:41.970]  patreon.com forward slash grow from your heart. Help us get a small, like just a zoom H four and
[01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:46.290]  a mic cable and a fucking Sennheiser mic just to get Mike recording. We need something simple so
[01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:50.370]  that he could press record and talk and make sure it works. I don't want the fancy one folks. I'd
[01:02:50.370 --> 01:02:55.090]  fuck it up. Yeah, we got him. I know. Even like a, even like a dollar as a tip for you helping
[01:02:55.090 --> 01:02:58.530]  out people is not a lot. There are a lot of people listening to help out. If we get,
[01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:03.570]  if everybody throws down one buck, we'll definitely get Mike a zoom H four and a mic and a mic cable,
[01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:08.610]  or I'll give you my PO box and you can just send us a zoom H four and a, like a three foot long
[01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:13.250]  mic cable and a Sennheiser. What are they? Three 85s. Just, you know, an affordable Sennheiser
[01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:18.530]  mic just for Mike to rant into and a good SD card. We need a good high quality SD card. So
[01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:23.010]  you could just record it, put it on the SD card, drop the SD card into the computer, email that
[01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:27.650]  file to me via Dropbox or maybe Google drives. However you want to do it. And then I'll load
[01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:31.970]  it and do a show. It'd be awesome. This is a crazy telethon. I like it though. It was random
[01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:36.610]  to, um, 500 episodes in without listener support. We wouldn't know. I'm just kidding.
[01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:44.850]  With viewers like you. That's right. Uh, the PBS, the fucking pothead bowling society. Um,
[01:03:45.650 --> 01:03:49.650]  that'd be rad. Why don't we do that next? Uh, all right. Well, I'll meet you guys at
[01:03:49.650 --> 01:03:54.210]  Bolero. No sunset bowl all day. Um, don't give up the real spot, bro.
[01:03:56.210 --> 01:04:00.050]  Can you edit that? No, we're going to find them down there and we're not going to be there. It's
[01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:04.290]  going to be funny. Um, you guys, this was a lot of fun. Episode 500. It is time is the point in
[01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:08.290]  the show where we quit being so real and we just start fucking smoking. So if you guys are waiting,
[01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:11.730]  if you're holding back, if you're trying to be fucking coherent, Clint, I'm looking at you for
[01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.170]  the podcast. Now you can take those extra couple of puffs. You can get lit. I'm going to start
[01:04:15.170 --> 01:04:20.050]  wrapping it up. Then I'm going to take a dab. Um, if anybody's got any shit that they want to say,
[01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:25.010]  um, for fucking a lot of viewers, uh, now's a good spot. Anybody who got any encouraging
[01:04:25.010 --> 01:04:29.970]  moments and encouraging words. I just want to thank everybody who listened to the episode I
[01:04:29.970 --> 01:04:34.930]  was on and, uh, send me messages and questions and stuff. Uh, hope I got back to you and
[01:04:34.930 --> 01:04:39.490]  answered everything. Uh, a lot of love and support and I really appreciate everyone. Um,

[01:04:42.530 --> 01:04:46.130]  one. Clint, you're looking at me like you got something to say. Yeah, just a happy new year,
[01:04:46.130 --> 01:04:50.930]  everybody. And, uh, be nice to each other. That's about it. We should just stop there. Goodbye guys.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.780]  That's fucking good. I love it. Everybody just went silent and played along. A lot of people
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:04.900]  looked at their phones and went, Oh fuck. They did. That's pretty good. Uh, Mike, any wise words,
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.260]  words for the wise words of wisdom, Mike's moments. Keep listening to the show. It's going
[01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:13.460]  to be a good year for the podcast. And, uh, if you care about cannabis, uh, pay attention to
[01:05:13.460 --> 01:05:18.260]  your local news. It's going to be a big year for cannabis too. That's the truth. That's the truth.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.620]  Make sure it's going to be huge for cannabis. Follow Mike on social media. He's Nemo punk 15
