[00:00.000 --> 00:07.200]  Yeah, welcome back podcast world.
[00:07.200 --> 00:08.000]  I'm your host.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.400]  My friends call me Rasta Jeff and this is episode 631 of the
[00:12.400 --> 00:14.000]  grow from your heart podcast.
[00:14.000 --> 00:16.900]  In this episode, I'm going to feature my friend Rasta Bob from
[00:16.900 --> 00:18.600]  Jamaica. Before we get there.
[00:18.600 --> 00:22.000]  Let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.600]  Of course, the 710 Club are those folks who support us on

[00:28.100 --> 00:29.400]  So with no further ado,
[00:29.800 --> 00:31.500]  Start off with the big grow from your heart podcast.
[00:31.500 --> 00:32.100]  Thank you.
[00:32.100 --> 00:58.160]  Shout out to my friend
[00:58.160 --> 01:06.920]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who continues to support the show on Patreon.

[01:16.680 --> 01:19.180]  All of the information you need is right there on the screen.
[01:19.180 --> 01:22.680]  And you know, I did include a link in the show notes and the video description to make
[01:22.680 --> 01:27.740]  it super easy for all of my friends who want to support the show for real big up.
[01:27.740 --> 01:29.880]  Thank you for all of the continued support.
[01:29.880 --> 01:33.420]  I don't want to ramble on too much at the start of this show because this is a great
[01:33.420 --> 01:35.020]  episode in my opinion.
[01:35.020 --> 01:38.660]  I do want to say thank you for watching the 420 episode.
[01:38.660 --> 01:41.340]  The previous episode was the 420 episode.
[01:41.340 --> 01:44.740]  I had about 25-30 friends pop through through the zoom meeting.
[01:44.740 --> 01:47.100]  I think there were 22 people on screen at one time.
[01:47.100 --> 01:49.180]  A few people came a few people went.
[01:49.180 --> 01:51.820]  Big thanks big shout out to everybody who came through.
[01:51.820 --> 01:54.720]  Big thanks and big shout out to everybody who watched that show.
[01:54.720 --> 01:57.260]  It was kind of a beautiful glorious train wreck.
[01:57.260 --> 02:01.180]  I don't know that I will invite so many people on camera ever again, but it was a wonderful
[02:01.180 --> 02:03.220]  experience and I did enjoy it.
[02:03.220 --> 02:04.980]  But like I said, I don't know if we'll do that again.
[02:04.980 --> 02:10.060]  We will have shows with other guests, but certainly not 25 other guests.
[02:10.060 --> 02:12.460]  All right, that part is out of the way.
[02:12.460 --> 02:14.820]  I thanked you for the 420 show.
[02:14.820 --> 02:18.540]  Now this is the 421 show.
[02:18.540 --> 02:24.260]  There is a special significance for 420 and 421 in the Rastafari culture.
[02:24.260 --> 02:26.900]  I got some good friends to teach us about it.
[02:26.900 --> 02:31.980]  Big shout out to my friends who came from Kingston, Jamaica to teach us about 420 and
[02:31.980 --> 02:34.580]  421 in Rastafari culture.
[02:34.580 --> 02:38.420]  A couple of things I should mention before we roll that clip.
[02:38.420 --> 02:41.580]  There are a lot of sounds of Jamaica in the background.
[02:41.580 --> 02:43.820]  They are not recording in a recording studio.
[02:43.820 --> 02:47.060]  They're recording in a banana field in Kingston, Jamaica.
[02:47.060 --> 02:48.560]  So you will hear birds.
[02:48.560 --> 02:49.560]  You will hear dogs.
[02:49.560 --> 02:50.800]  You may hear a car.
[02:50.800 --> 02:54.440]  You may hear some Jamaican reggae music in the background.
[02:54.440 --> 02:56.420]  It is the natural sound of Jamaica.
[02:56.940 --> 02:57.940]  I enjoyed it.
[02:57.940 --> 02:58.940]  I appreciated it.
[02:58.940 --> 03:00.940]  Bob and I were having some scheduling conflicts.
[03:00.940 --> 03:05.540]  I was actually out of town for the 420 weekend and a couple of days before that.
[03:05.540 --> 03:07.300]  Bob was trying to record with me then.
[03:07.300 --> 03:10.460]  Also, Bob's got that beautiful Jamaican internet.
[03:10.460 --> 03:14.460]  So his internet wasn't really super strong at some times and his Zoom meeting kind of
[03:14.460 --> 03:15.580]  goes wonky a little bit.
[03:15.580 --> 03:19.260]  So Bob was kind enough to set up a camera, grab a Rastafari elder.
[03:19.260 --> 03:22.580]  Big thanks and big respect to the Rastafari elder who appeared on camera for us to teach
[03:22.580 --> 03:26.980]  us a lot about Rastafari and 420 and the correlation.
[03:26.980 --> 03:31.900]  But Bob grabbed a camera, they pressed record and they recorded a segment to teach us about
[03:31.900 --> 03:39.180]  the importance of 420 and 421 to Jamaica and Rastas and Rastafari across Jamaica.
[03:39.180 --> 03:40.560]  This will raise some questions.
[03:40.560 --> 03:41.840]  You guys will have a lot of questions.
[03:41.840 --> 03:45.780]  If you're not familiar with Rasta culture, some of these things may be brand new words,
[03:45.780 --> 03:47.740]  brand new terms, brand new phrases to you.
[03:47.740 --> 03:50.900]  If you've got any questions, I look forward to your emails, your questions.
[03:50.900 --> 03:54.180]  My email address is growfromyourheartathotmail.com.
[03:54.180 --> 03:57.460]  Cannot wait to hear the questions that this show brings up.
[03:57.460 --> 03:58.500]  You guys, I feel like I'm rambling.
[03:58.500 --> 04:00.500]  I said I wasn't going to do that.
[04:00.500 --> 04:05.900]  So with no further ado, let's bring in the segment with Rasta Bob and his friend from Jamaica.
[04:07.900 --> 04:08.900]  You set the record?
[04:08.900 --> 04:09.900]  Yeah man.
[04:09.900 --> 04:10.900]  Oh, okay.
[04:11.900 --> 04:12.900]  All right.
[04:12.900 --> 04:15.900]  So the importance of 420 to Rastafari.
[04:16.900 --> 04:21.900]  Just trying to share with the international community that, you know, just thinking back,
[04:21.900 --> 04:28.900]  the visit of his majesty on the 21st and the year that it happened, I think it was what,
[04:28.900 --> 04:29.900]  63?
[04:29.900 --> 04:30.900]  Six.
[04:30.900 --> 04:31.900]  66.
[04:31.900 --> 04:32.900]  All right.
[04:32.900 --> 04:36.900]  So thinking back in Jamaica's history, back then, Ganja was super illegal or criminalized,
[04:36.900 --> 04:42.900]  you know, where Rasta was being beaten and, you know, eventually, it was very hard time
[04:42.900 --> 04:44.900]  where people would take on to Ganja.
[04:44.900 --> 04:49.900]  But that day, I know in particular, it was almost like it was free that day.
[04:49.900 --> 04:55.900]  You know, I hear people talking about thousands of chalice and thousands of spliff and whole heap of pounds of herb
[04:55.900 --> 04:57.900]  and police not knowing what to do.
[04:57.900 --> 04:59.900]  They actually, they gave a free for all.
[04:59.900 --> 05:03.900]  They didn't even was concerned about Ganja.
[05:03.900 --> 05:11.900]  And that day, 420, in the preparation, you know, intensity for his visit of his imperial majesty,
[05:11.900 --> 05:13.900]  the following day, the 21st.
[05:13.900 --> 05:16.900]  So I just kind of hoping if you could just, you know.
[05:16.900 --> 05:17.900]  Yeah, man.
[05:17.900 --> 05:18.900]  Give thanks.
[05:18.900 --> 05:30.900]  I think that what we now know as 420 didn't exist until perhaps a decade or a little less than a decade after 1966,
[05:30.900 --> 05:33.900]  which is when his majesty came to Jamaica.
[05:33.900 --> 05:44.900]  Now, the important visit of his majesty started from the 18th of April in Trinidad, which was his first stop.
[05:44.900 --> 05:49.900]  But by the 21st of April, he was on his way to Jamaica.
[05:49.900 --> 05:59.900]  Now, Jamaica had declared a public holiday for the 21st of April 1966 to meet the arrival of his majesty.
[06:00.900 --> 06:11.900]  What that meant is that Rastafari, who was still very much the outcast in Jamaica, started to mobilize themselves on the 20th.
[06:11.900 --> 06:17.900]  So the 20th became a major mobilization day for Rastafari.
[06:17.900 --> 06:25.900]  And if you remember that at those, in those days, Rastafari couldn't take a bus and didn't have certain kind of access.
[06:25.900 --> 06:38.900]  So the accounts of various brethren is that they started to walk from all over the island into the gullies through the Hope Valley in an effort to get out by the airport.
[06:38.900 --> 06:44.900]  And in so doing, they were also sure that a part of the celebration was ganja.
[06:44.900 --> 06:53.900]  So part of the account of his majesty is people actually came out with herb branches, palm leaves.
[06:54.900 --> 06:56.900]  Big ganja branches.
[06:56.900 --> 07:05.900]  As parts of the celebration of this ancient king who would now touch down on the Jamaican land.
[07:05.900 --> 07:22.900]  What it meant is that Rastafari, who hold ganja as a part of the connection to the divine, wanted to in a sense create a herb atmosphere to receive the Solomonic king.
[07:22.900 --> 07:28.900]  Because you know, as far as we are concerned, ganja is a part of that Solomonic legacy.
[07:28.900 --> 07:36.900]  A part of our lore is that it is the herb that emerges from the tomb of Solomon after he passes.
[07:36.900 --> 07:48.900]  So in receiving this king and in keeping with our fire element, because fire is an element that is very much central to Rastafari experience.
[07:49.900 --> 08:01.900]  In lieu of building a fire key and holding a Nyabingi, the ritual of ganja becomes the embodiment of that fire principle.
[08:01.900 --> 08:13.900]  So what is said is that Bredrin stormed the tarmac, blazing chalice and issuing smoke of incense of herbganja.
[08:14.900 --> 08:21.900]  The official protocol could do nothing but just silently observe.
[08:21.900 --> 08:28.900]  They couldn't choose to arrest or in any way abuse Rastafari, which still was very much standard.
[08:28.900 --> 08:40.900]  Because if you remember, three years before his majesty arrived in Jamaica, we had a major Rastafari repression in the Cardadnes incident in 1963.
[08:40.900 --> 08:49.900]  So a part of our conversation is that his majesty actually came three years later to check on Ayannae, particularly as it emerged from there.
[08:49.900 --> 08:55.900]  I don't want you to stray from there. So that's why 1963 was sticking out in my brain.
[08:55.900 --> 09:00.900]  So the Coral Gardens incident was really just in summary for all the viewers and listeners.
[09:00.900 --> 09:08.900]  It was just where the state itself, from my understanding, the government issued a decree that a terrible atrocity was...
[09:08.900 --> 09:09.900]  Killed them.
[09:09.900 --> 09:12.900]  Yeah, killed them. Killed them on sight. Beat them, killed them.
[09:12.900 --> 09:16.900]  It wasn't even the police and the soldiers that were given that authority.
[09:16.900 --> 09:23.900]  I heard that even the excellence of society, public, general public, they can beat and kill Rasta.
[09:23.900 --> 09:24.900]  Good Friday.
[09:24.900 --> 09:27.900]  And their good Friday. Bad Friday for Rasta.
[09:27.900 --> 09:38.900]  But I get your point. The real thing is that Herb became a major part of how Rastafari mobilized the day before his majesty arrived.
[09:38.900 --> 09:50.900]  So in our mind, the real beginning of 420 is our overnight vigil in receiving his majesty.
[09:50.900 --> 09:58.900]  Now I know 420 also has a time issue, has a culture operating around a certain time of the day for this Herb Sacrament.
[09:58.900 --> 10:14.900]  And I wouldn't necessarily claim that Rastafari needed that kind of retreat that the 420 space that emerges in the 70s among mummies and a range of people who are trying to have this break.
[10:15.900 --> 10:23.900]  For us, Herb is not a break. It is a part of our consistent communing.
[10:23.900 --> 10:33.900]  In some instances, people talk about micro dosing. Well, it is our micro dosing throughout the day if we are allowed to.
[10:34.900 --> 10:47.900]  Because it doesn't impair. In fact, we develop the kind of training where Herb becomes a necessary sort of nutrient to fuel and keep our work moving.
[10:47.900 --> 10:59.900]  And we come out of that space where Herb infused work becomes clearly a demonstration of our spirituality and our philosophy.
[11:00.900 --> 11:07.900]  In fact, some people think that they can't work unless the heavens have been set correctly in this Herb space.
[11:07.900 --> 11:21.900]  So our Herb approach is not necessarily driven by an hour, even though we do have that kind of approach where people would have a morning cup as a way of setting themselves for the day.
[11:22.900 --> 11:29.900]  And then they might want one midday, certainly after work.
[11:29.900 --> 11:40.900]  And that is usually, I suppose, more in keeping with that idea of 420, that after work, unwinding, usually in a congregation.
[11:41.900 --> 11:46.900]  I think it was more the school, after school, 420, that was really the whole high school.
[11:46.900 --> 11:52.900]  That was when school was out a little early. So 420, we all link up somewhere.
[11:52.900 --> 11:54.900]  It is our night school.
[11:54.900 --> 12:01.900]  Yes, but that is a custom of our rights more embedded. So it is not targeted for a specific time frame.
[12:01.900 --> 12:06.900]  But maybe on a lunar cycle, right around, it is more interwoven within that tradition.
[12:06.900 --> 12:09.900]  So that is the whole 420 and all the celebrations going out.
[12:09.900 --> 12:16.900]  So I just wanted to give a little height in terms of what that day, 420, represented for us,
[12:16.900 --> 12:21.900]  for the different celebratory preparation kind of aspect that it will mean.
[12:21.900 --> 12:28.900]  420 begins with us in principle, just based on the importance of the arrival of His Majesty.
[12:28.900 --> 12:33.900]  It is a major anniversary of our mobilization.
[12:33.900 --> 12:43.900]  It is a community. That is when our Nabi begins. It actually begins on the night of the 20th in honor of receiving His Majesty's arrival on the 21st.
[12:43.900 --> 12:51.900]  So the 20th of April, which is how we would speak it, is an important mobilization day for Ireland.
[12:51.900 --> 12:59.900]  And what that would mean is that one would be coming in with their sacrament as a part of this communion that is shared freely.
[12:59.900 --> 13:12.900]  You know, ponds of herb, barrels and bales of herb coming in to the various points that I and I would move to congregate, usually for a Nabi celebration.
[13:12.900 --> 13:17.900]  Well, we give thanks. We appreciate the time. We appreciate everything.
[13:17.900 --> 13:19.900]  Bonganaya.
[13:19.900 --> 13:22.900]  See you in Haya. Ganja talk.
[13:23.900 --> 13:28.900]  All right, podcast world, I don't have a lot left to say after that beautiful segment from our friends from Jamaica.
[13:28.900 --> 13:34.900]  I do want to make sure to take a moment and give thanks to our friends for taking time out of their day to film that video for us.
[13:34.900 --> 13:39.900]  We got to see the Jamaican sunshine. We got to see the banana trees in the background. That was beautiful.
[13:39.900 --> 13:45.900]  I appreciate that. So thank you. Also, thank you for sharing the wisdom and knowledge with us.
[13:45.900 --> 14:00.900]  You shared a lot of knowledge about the island of Jamaica, the significance of 420 and 421, the significance of those dates for the island, the significance of those dates for Rasta and the significance of that day and those dates for Ganja.
[14:00.900 --> 14:08.900]  And I love the correlation of all of that. So give thanks. Big respect for teaching us so much about Ganja and Rasta and 420 and such a short time.
[14:08.900 --> 14:12.900]  That was beautiful. Give thanks. Big respect. I appreciate you.
[14:12.900 --> 14:18.900]  Everybody else out there, thank you for watching. Thank you for hanging out with my friends from Jamaica. I'm sure you enjoyed it as much as I did.
