[00:01.020 --> 00:21.370]  Welcome back podcast world. I'm your host, my friends call me Rasta Jeff and it's time for episode 591 of the Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[00:21.370 --> 00:28.370]  You know I like to start this show off by talking about what I'm smoking. Today I've been taking dabs of Bounce Live Batter.
[00:28.370 --> 00:35.370]  This is a blend of Headbanger and Secret Kush mints. On the package the flavor is described as sour, gas and pine.
[00:35.370 --> 00:42.370]  We've talked about this concentrate on the podcast before. I'm a big fan of the sour, gassy, pine flavors and aromas.
[00:42.370 --> 00:47.370]  I also think those flavors and aromas are always accompanied by a really nice buzz.
[00:47.370 --> 00:54.370]  On the back of the package it says it contains 68.17% THC and non-detectable amounts of CBD.
[00:54.370 --> 00:57.370]  So big shout out to the Bounce Live Batter.
[00:57.370 --> 01:01.370]  In this episode I'm going to do a couple of updates from a previous episode.
[01:01.370 --> 01:03.370]  I'm also going to read a couple of Patreon questions.
[01:03.370 --> 01:08.370]  Before we get there let's do a few shout outs to a few members of the 710 Club.
[01:08.370 --> 01:14.370]  Of course the 710 Club are the folks who support us on Patreon at the $7.10 a month level or higher.
[01:14.370 --> 01:18.370]  So with no further ado let's start off with the big Grow From Your Heart podcast.
[01:18.370 --> 01:20.370]  Thank you shout out to my friend Karen Crawford.
[01:20.370 --> 01:23.370]  Let's follow that up with a big thank you shout out to 716 Vibes.
[01:23.370 --> 01:26.370]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Grow Man Stan.
[01:26.370 --> 01:28.370]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Dr. Dendro.
[01:29.370 --> 01:32.370]  I've always got a big special thank you shout out for a fellow podcaster.
[01:32.370 --> 01:34.370]  Let's send a thank you shout out to Max Scrimm and Ruby.
[01:34.370 --> 01:37.370]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Josiah W.
[01:37.370 --> 01:40.370]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to Pac Northwest Dan.
[01:40.370 --> 01:43.370]  I want to send a thank you shout out to Smokey J1360.
[01:43.370 --> 01:47.370]  Let's send a big thank you shout out to our fellow cannabis friend Zoso J.
[01:47.370 --> 01:54.370]  And last but certainly not least let's send a big Grow From Your Heart podcast thank you shout out to my buddy Tonto.
[01:54.370 --> 01:58.370]  Big thank you and big shout out to everybody who supports the show on Patreon.
[01:58.370 --> 02:01.370]  If you're not already supporting the show and you'd like to learn how to do so,
[02:01.370 --> 02:07.370]  all you have to do is visit www.patreon.com forward slash growfromyourheart.
[02:07.370 --> 02:10.370]  All of the information you need will be right there on the screen.
[02:10.370 --> 02:17.370]  And of course I did include a link in the show notes and in the video description to make it nice and easy for all of my friends.
[02:18.370 --> 02:25.370]  Alright, speaking of thank you, I want to send a big thank you to everybody who supported us on the Black Friday sale.
[02:25.370 --> 02:29.370]  That's right, if you supported iRegenetics and the iRegenetics web store, thank you.
[02:29.370 --> 02:35.370]  I had everything on sale for 20% off and you guys took great advantage of that sale so thank you.
[02:35.370 --> 02:41.370]  Also shout out to everybody who took advantage of the sales at seedsherenow.com and at the other vendors.
[02:42.370 --> 02:48.370]  I had a record week at seedsherenow.com so thank you for all of that support. I do appreciate it.
[02:48.370 --> 02:54.370]  Speaking of support, I encourage you to sign up for the newsletter at iRegenetics.com.
[02:54.370 --> 02:56.370]  That's right, I've got an updated website.
[02:56.370 --> 03:00.370]  On that updated website there is a spot where you can sign up for a newsletter.
[03:00.370 --> 03:10.370]  If you go to iRegenetics.com, sign up for the newsletter, you will get a message every time I do a sale at seedsherenow.com or one of the other vendors.
[03:10.370 --> 03:13.370]  You'll also get a message every time I do a sale in the Etsy store.
[03:13.370 --> 03:17.370]  I'll try to send you a message every time I add new merchandise to the Etsy store.
[03:17.370 --> 03:21.370]  I will do my best to keep you updated with the new mailing list.
[03:21.370 --> 03:27.370]  I do also apologize for the old mailing list at which I failed miserably.
[03:27.370 --> 03:33.370]  I asked a bunch of people to email me at a certain email address and I said that I would add you to the emailing list.
[03:33.370 --> 03:38.370]  Unfortunately, Google thought that that was a big spam list and it would never work for me.
[03:38.370 --> 03:40.370]  I couldn't figure it out and I failed.
[03:40.370 --> 03:45.370]  So I apologize, but the new mailing list does go through MailChimp and it works beautifully.
[03:45.370 --> 03:48.370]  So I encourage you and I invite you to sign up for the newsletter.
[03:48.370 --> 03:51.370]  That way you don't miss any of the sales, any of the events.
[03:51.370 --> 04:01.370]  You can stay up to date with all things Grow From Your Heart podcast, all things iRegenetics, all things Rasta Jeff at iRegenetics.com.
[04:01.370 --> 04:06.370]  All right, this is the part of the show where we work our way into Patreon messages.
[04:06.370 --> 04:12.370]  In a previous episode, I talked about changing our timer for daylight savings time and I asked for feedback.
[04:12.370 --> 04:16.370]  I got a couple of great messages. I chose three of them for today's episode.
[04:16.370 --> 04:26.370]  This one goes just like this. It says, Hey Rasta Jeff, when it comes to daylight savings time, I personally change my life and my schedule and continue on with the regular 12-12.
[04:26.370 --> 04:33.370]  Then once my flowering plants have finished, I change the cycle back to my preferred time.
[04:33.370 --> 04:43.370]  Years ago, I would change the timer and the night hours. I would extend the dark period for one hour that day or night before to compensate for daylight savings time.
[04:43.370 --> 04:50.370]  Now it just feels better for me to allow them to continue as scheduled and change my routine for them.
[04:50.370 --> 04:56.370]  Yes, that is probably the way to go. It goes on to say, the last thing these plants need is more stress.
[04:56.370 --> 05:01.370]  Humans care about daylight savings time. Plants most likely think it is ridiculous.
[05:01.370 --> 05:07.370]  That is absolutely right. Time is a human construct. Time is an invention. Time is imaginary.
[05:07.370 --> 05:13.370]  I always say that, but then think about payday. If I don't pay you for your time, you're going to be bitchy about time.
[05:13.370 --> 05:17.370]  But time is imaginary. Time is made up. The plants don't care what the clock says.
[05:17.370 --> 05:22.370]  The plants are worried about did the sun come up and did the sun go down? That's how they know what time it was.
[05:22.370 --> 05:27.370]  That is all they are worried about. So you are absolutely correct. The last thing they need is more stress.
[05:28.370 --> 05:35.370]  And yes, we did invent time. That is a human construct. So you are right. The plants probably think that daylight savings time is ridiculous.
[05:35.370 --> 05:43.370]  I want to send a special thank you shout out to our buddy JH. Thank you for listening and thank you for sending me an update about your daylight savings time.
[05:43.370 --> 05:49.370]  I got another message right in front of me. It comes from our friend Michael S. And it says, I just let it ride.
[05:49.370 --> 05:55.370]  I set up my light cycle with daylight savings time in mind. So here's a person that is planning and thinking ahead.
[05:55.370 --> 06:01.370]  It says, even with the hour time change, I can still get in there before I leave in the morning, before the lights go out.
[06:01.370 --> 06:08.370]  And it's back on when I get home from work. Much love, Rasta Jeff, and thank you for everything you do.
[06:08.370 --> 06:14.370]  So he said that the lights are on. You can get in there and work on them before you leave for work.
[06:14.370 --> 06:20.370]  And it's back on when you get home from work. Dude, are you gone for 12 hours at work? That's a long day.
[06:20.370 --> 06:26.370]  I understand that you might be a grower. You might be growing at work also. Big shout out to our buddy Michael S.
[06:26.370 --> 06:32.370]  For also adjusting to the plants and keeping the plants happy. I see a theme happening here in these messages.
[06:32.370 --> 06:42.370]  I do have one more message. This one came from El Herbalog and it says, hey Rasta Jeff, I adjust my life and my grow schedule for the benefit of my plants.
[06:42.370 --> 06:48.370]  I see a trend here, you guys. Three out of three, all these people adjust their lives to the schedule of the plants.
[06:48.370 --> 06:53.370]  They don't adjust their plants to the schedule of their lives. Kind of shows the passion in these growers.
[06:53.370 --> 06:58.370]  It says, I admit that I forgot about daylight savings time, but I changed my damn alarm to wake up an hour earlier.
[06:58.370 --> 07:05.370]  Great podcast, great content. I appreciate the positive vibe. Keep it, Irie brother, from El Herbalog.
[07:05.370 --> 07:10.370]  I think that's how you say that. Lerbalog, El Herbalog. Either way, thank you for the great message.
[07:10.370 --> 07:14.370]  Thank you for the update. And I will keep up the positive vibe and the great content.
[07:14.370 --> 07:19.370]  Thank you to our buddy, Herbalog. And big shout out to everybody who sent me a message.
[07:19.370 --> 07:23.370]  I know I only read three of them on today's podcast, but I saw a theme.
[07:23.370 --> 07:28.370]  Everybody is adjusting their life to the plants, not adjusting the plants to their lives.
[07:28.370 --> 07:32.370]  So that shows some dedication and some commitment to our gardens.
[07:32.370 --> 07:36.370]  All right, let's work our way into some fresh content here.
[07:36.370 --> 07:40.370]  This is a question that comes from our friend Flavor Maker, a longtime listener, a longtime supporter.
[07:40.370 --> 07:43.370]  What up, Flavor Maker? I hope you're well, bro. Thank you for the great content.
[07:43.370 --> 07:51.370]  This question goes, I've got a grow question. I've got an LED. I've got a T5 LED two bar sunblaze light.
[07:51.370 --> 07:56.370]  So this is a, it's an LED T5 light, which sounds like a, it's a combo light.
[07:56.370 --> 08:02.370]  It's an LED, a T5 LED bulb in a sunblaze two bar fixture.
[08:02.370 --> 08:06.370]  So there are two of these LED T5 bulbs in a sunblaze fixture.
[08:06.370 --> 08:11.370]  It's a lot of words for just one light. It goes on to say, in germination week one to two,
[08:11.370 --> 08:14.370]  how high overhead do people average?
[08:14.370 --> 08:18.370]  So the question here is how high above the plants in weeks one and two,
[08:18.370 --> 08:23.370]  would I hang my T5 LED two bar sunblaze light?
[08:23.370 --> 08:27.370]  It says, are bleaching and burning issues? Will there be recovery?
[08:27.370 --> 08:30.370]  Did I alter the outcome by stressing them at burning?
[08:30.370 --> 08:33.370]  Then it says, I definitely see variations among three different breeders.
[08:33.370 --> 08:37.370]  I feel embarrassed asking this, but we all get better on micro topics like this.
[08:37.370 --> 08:40.370]  Never be embarrassed to ask a question. That's what I'm here for.
[08:40.370 --> 08:43.370]  I've probably made the mistake that I can prevent you from making.
[08:43.370 --> 08:46.370]  I've probably seen somebody make the mistake that you're about to make.
[08:46.370 --> 08:48.370]  So never be afraid to ask a question.
[08:48.370 --> 08:50.370]  The stupidest question is the one you didn't ask.
[08:50.370 --> 08:53.370]  And then that mistake you made was a stupid mistake.
[08:53.370 --> 08:55.370]  So I'm here for you to answer that question.
[08:55.370 --> 08:58.370]  Let me get myself back on track. Those dabs are working, you guys.
[08:58.370 --> 09:03.370]  It says, I learned the smallest changes can have huge adverse outcomes.
[09:03.370 --> 09:05.370]  That is very true in cannabis.
[09:05.370 --> 09:09.370]  And something you do today, you're not going to see the outcome for seven to 10 days.
[09:09.370 --> 09:13.370]  And then you don't get to actually see the real outcome for maybe nine weeks.
[09:13.370 --> 09:16.370]  So yes, small things do have huge outcomes.
[09:16.370 --> 09:18.370]  It says from soybean to soybean,
[09:18.370 --> 09:21.370]  you're going to see the smallest changes in the next seven to 10 days.
[09:21.370 --> 09:24.370]  So yes, small things do have huge outcomes.
[09:24.370 --> 09:29.370]  It says from soil density, light and environmental, all things have a huge effect.
[09:29.370 --> 09:34.370]  Anyway, feel free to share or just help with the question above. Thanks, man.
[09:34.370 --> 09:38.370]  Well, I'm doing both. I'm going to share and I'm going to help you with your question.
[09:38.370 --> 09:42.370]  I didn't know much about the T5 LED sunblaze lighting.
[09:42.370 --> 09:44.370]  I actually had to do some research on that.
[09:44.370 --> 09:46.370]  I'm not familiar with that product.
[09:46.370 --> 09:54.370]  Everything I read and everything that makes sense to me says to keep that light between 12 and 24 inches above your canopy.
[09:54.370 --> 09:57.370]  A lot of the things said 18 inches is ideal.
[09:57.370 --> 10:01.370]  Some things said 12, some said go as high as 24.
[10:01.370 --> 10:04.370]  So between 12 and 24 seems ideal.
[10:04.370 --> 10:06.370]  About 18 inches makes sense to me.
[10:06.370 --> 10:12.370]  What I would do, put your light 18 to 24 inches above your plant.
[10:12.370 --> 10:14.370]  I'm guessing that's about here from the table.
[10:14.370 --> 10:16.370]  18 or 24 inches above the plant.
[10:16.370 --> 10:18.370]  You want this, so give yourself a couple inches for the plant.
[10:18.370 --> 10:20.370]  You got to raise that up.
[10:20.370 --> 10:22.370]  18 to 24 inches above the plant.
[10:22.370 --> 10:24.370]  Pay attention to that plant.
[10:24.370 --> 10:26.370]  Does the plant look like it wants more light?
[10:26.370 --> 10:27.370]  Is it lifting up?
[10:27.370 --> 10:30.370]  If the leaves go up, if they're praying, it may want more light.
[10:30.370 --> 10:34.370]  If the leaves start curling and going down, it may be getting too much light.
[10:34.370 --> 10:38.370]  If the leaves get droopy, it has had enough light and it wants a little bit of a break.
[10:38.370 --> 10:43.370]  You could probably raise that light up and give it a little bit less PPFD,
[10:43.370 --> 10:47.370]  a little bit less U-moles per joule wouldn't be a bad idea for that plant.
[10:47.370 --> 10:52.370]  So the main thing you have to do is watch the plant.
[10:52.370 --> 10:54.370]  Put that light above the plant.
[10:54.370 --> 10:55.370]  Watch how the plant responds.
[10:55.370 --> 10:58.370]  Put your hand right above the plant.
[10:58.370 --> 11:00.370]  Just touch the top of the plant and leave your hand there.
[11:00.370 --> 11:02.370]  Does it feel like your hand is getting a burn?
[11:02.370 --> 11:03.370]  Does it feel uncomfortable?
[11:03.370 --> 11:05.370]  Does it feel like a sunburn?
[11:05.370 --> 11:08.370]  If your hand doesn't want to stay there, either does the plant.
[11:08.370 --> 11:10.370]  If you can leave your hand there and be like, yeah, that's fine,
[11:10.370 --> 11:13.370]  the plant will probably agree with you.
[11:13.370 --> 11:15.370]  You have to watch the plant though.
[11:15.370 --> 11:18.370]  Over time, that plant may say, hey, I've had enough of that light.
[11:18.370 --> 11:21.370]  You may want to raise that light or turn it down or I'm going to react to you.
[11:21.370 --> 11:25.370]  The first thing it will do, the leaves will start to kind of claw down.
[11:25.370 --> 11:29.370]  They'll just kind of just instead of being nice and turgid and they have that almost a taco,
[11:29.370 --> 11:33.370]  almost a canoe when they're just right, they'll start to droop just a little bit.
[11:33.370 --> 11:36.370]  And then if you give them too much light, they'll droop even, they'll claw a little bit.
[11:36.370 --> 11:38.370]  And if you give them too much light, they'll droop.
[11:38.370 --> 11:40.370]  So they'll claw down and then they will droop.
[11:40.370 --> 11:42.370]  That is saying, hey, I've had way too much light.
[11:42.370 --> 11:44.370]  I'm having issues.
[11:44.370 --> 11:47.370]  One of the most obvious signs you may see is leaf twisting,
[11:47.370 --> 11:49.370]  but that is a sign of way too much light, way too intense,
[11:49.370 --> 11:52.370]  which I don't think you'll get from these little two bars.
[11:52.370 --> 11:57.370]  So my advice to you is to start about 24 inches above the canopy,
[11:57.370 --> 12:00.370]  slowly raise it down to about 18 inches and pay attention to the plants.
[12:00.370 --> 12:03.370]  As they get bigger, as they get more stout, they'll be able to photosynthesize more.
[12:03.370 --> 12:06.370]  They'll want and they'll be able to take more light.
[12:06.370 --> 12:08.370]  So just lower that light down.
[12:08.370 --> 12:13.370]  Don't go past 12 inches from everything I read because that is when you will experience the next thing you talked about,
[12:13.370 --> 12:15.370]  burning and bleaching.
[12:15.370 --> 12:20.370]  These LED lights do have the potential to burn and bleach our plants if we get them too close.
[12:20.370 --> 12:23.370]  So keep that 12 inch distance at least.
[12:23.370 --> 12:26.370]  Focus a little bit higher while the plants are smaller.
[12:26.370 --> 12:28.370]  And I think that will keep you safe.
[12:28.370 --> 12:31.370]  Unfortunately, I have not used these specific lights.
[12:31.370 --> 12:34.370]  Most of what I talk about on the show is firsthand experience.
[12:34.370 --> 12:35.370]  I had to research this.
[12:35.370 --> 12:41.370]  So I'm giving you secondhand advice using logic and research.
[12:41.370 --> 12:43.370]  That's all I've got for you on that.
[12:43.370 --> 12:45.370]  Let's keep going. There's more.
[12:45.370 --> 12:47.370]  It says, anyway, oh, I think I wrapped it up.
[12:47.370 --> 12:50.370]  Feel free to use this or just help with the questions above.
[12:50.370 --> 12:52.370]  I hope I answered your question.
[12:52.370 --> 12:56.370]  18 to 24 inches, I would start about 24, work it down to 18.
[12:56.370 --> 13:03.370]  Don't go closer than those 12 inches because on my research, that is where we start getting the burning, the bleaching, and the issues.
[13:03.370 --> 13:06.370]  All right, Flavor Maker, I want to thank you for the great question.
[13:06.370 --> 13:08.370]  Let me know how your plants are looking.
[13:08.370 --> 13:10.370]  If you've got a follow-up, let me know.
[13:10.370 --> 13:14.370]  I want to know how high above that canopy you've got the plants and how it's working for you.
[13:14.370 --> 13:16.370]  Again, the plants are the boss.
[13:16.370 --> 13:20.370]  If the plants are responding negatively, raise or lower that fucking light.
[13:20.370 --> 13:22.370]  I could be wrong. We could be wrong.
[13:22.370 --> 13:24.370]  That plant could be an anomaly.
[13:24.370 --> 13:25.370]  Adjust to the plants.
[13:25.370 --> 13:27.370]  I love meters. I love gauges.
[13:27.370 --> 13:29.370]  I love toys. I love advice.
[13:29.370 --> 13:30.370]  I love all that stuff.
[13:30.370 --> 13:33.370]  But the main thing about this is watching the plants.
[13:33.370 --> 13:35.370]  We are in a relationship with the plants.
[13:35.370 --> 13:42.370]  The only way you're going to make a relationship work is by watching the thing you're in a relationship with and adjusting to that.
[13:42.370 --> 13:44.370]  You can message me and say, hey, what would I do?
[13:44.370 --> 13:48.370]  And I could give you advice and tell you what to do, but you have to watch how the plant responds to that.
[13:48.370 --> 13:50.370]  And if I'm wrong, I could be wrong.
[13:50.370 --> 13:52.370]  That plant may want something different.
[13:52.370 --> 13:54.370]  You've got to pay attention to the plants.
[13:54.370 --> 13:59.370]  The meters may say, put it when you get a meter, when you get equipment, they're always recommended ranges.
[13:59.370 --> 14:03.370]  All the growers, myself, the podcast, the Internet, we've all got recommended ranges.
[14:03.370 --> 14:06.370]  Your plant may say, fuck your recommended range.
[14:06.370 --> 14:08.370]  I'm a weirdo. I want a pH of nine.
[14:08.370 --> 14:13.370]  The plant's not ever going to want a pH of nine, but maybe there's one plant out there that thrives.
[14:13.370 --> 14:15.370]  One cannabis plant that wants that pH of nine.
[14:15.370 --> 14:16.370]  We've got to give it that.
[14:16.370 --> 14:18.370]  Who cares what the meters say?
[14:18.370 --> 14:19.370]  Who cares what the Internet says?
[14:19.370 --> 14:21.370]  That plant wants something weird.
[14:21.370 --> 14:22.370]  I'm a weird dude.
[14:22.370 --> 14:25.370]  I like to eat and drink random shit that most people probably wouldn't enjoy.
[14:25.370 --> 14:26.370]  I drink a gang of kombucha.
[14:26.370 --> 14:29.370]  Most people would say, I don't want that much kombucha.
[14:29.370 --> 14:30.370]  I do. I'm an anomaly.
[14:30.370 --> 14:32.370]  I would be happy with it.
[14:32.370 --> 14:34.370]  So maybe your plants are weirdos.
[14:34.370 --> 14:35.370]  Maybe they're anomalies just like me.
[14:35.370 --> 14:39.370]  Maybe you've got to feed them a little bit differently, adjust them a little bit differently.
[14:39.370 --> 14:41.370]  Always pay attention to the plants.
[14:41.370 --> 14:42.370]  I've rambled long enough about that.
[14:42.370 --> 14:44.370]  Let's get into a new email.
[14:44.370 --> 14:47.370]  This one says, yo, Rasta Jeff, how are you?
[14:47.370 --> 14:53.370]  I heard you mention at one time to increase the lights on time toward the end of the flowering phase.
[14:53.370 --> 14:55.370]  So increase the lights on time.
[14:55.370 --> 14:57.370]  Wow, I should have read that.
[14:57.370 --> 15:00.370]  Increase the lights on time toward the end of the flowering phase.
[15:00.370 --> 15:04.370]  If you don't mind me asking, could you please give me another rundown on that?
[15:04.370 --> 15:07.370]  I'm in the last stages of flowering and I want to try this.
[15:07.370 --> 15:09.370]  Thank you so much for all of your knowledge.
[15:09.370 --> 15:11.370]  I'm such a better grower thanks to you.
[15:11.370 --> 15:12.370]  That means a lot to me.
[15:12.370 --> 15:14.370]  I'm glad you're a better grower from listening to me.
[15:14.370 --> 15:16.370]  That means you took my advice and you actually used it.
[15:16.370 --> 15:18.370]  So shout out to you as well.
[15:18.370 --> 15:21.370]  I'm glad you're improving and I'm glad you're seeing improvement.
[15:21.370 --> 15:25.370]  It says, I'm growing a rise for the third run and I look forward to purchasing more.
[15:25.370 --> 15:28.370]  I haven't been smoking for eight months now because I've been on probation.
[15:28.370 --> 15:34.370]  Oh man, I want to see pictures of your arise and I can't wait to smoke with you when you're off of probation.
[15:34.370 --> 15:40.370]  It says, that's about to end now and I'll be able to smoke all of the arise I've been drying and curing.
[15:40.370 --> 15:42.370]  Oh man, I'm excited for that for you.
[15:42.370 --> 15:46.370]  This one came from our friend, Reggie in my head and he signed it with love and respect.
[15:46.370 --> 15:48.370]  That is a great email.
[15:48.370 --> 15:54.370]  I'm going to talk about this, but let me read another one because I had two people send me basically the same question.
[15:54.370 --> 16:00.370]  And I'm going to cover the one answer with both of these emails with one answer.
[16:00.370 --> 16:04.370]  It says, Ross to Jeff, thanks for the grow knowledge and the positive vibes.
[16:04.370 --> 16:07.370]  I'm starting week eight of flower in prohibition land.
[16:07.370 --> 16:10.370]  The trikes are starting to become cloudy on the dude grow show.
[16:10.370 --> 16:16.370]  They mentioned flipping back to 18 six from 12 12 during the last week of flower.
[16:16.370 --> 16:19.370]  They say it will increase turps smell and taste.
[16:19.370 --> 16:20.370]  Does this work?
[16:20.370 --> 16:23.370]  Then they list a little bit about their gross setup.
[16:23.370 --> 16:30.370]  It says, I've been, I have a weaker light and it seems I'm about a week behind on flowering compared to the recommended eight weeks.
[16:30.370 --> 16:33.370]  When a breeder recommends eight weeks, they always mean nine weeks.
[16:33.370 --> 16:35.370]  Eight weeks is a good selling point.
[16:35.370 --> 16:37.370]  Always expect nine weeks.
[16:37.370 --> 16:40.370]  It goes on to say the trikes are telling me they have about a week to go.
[16:40.370 --> 16:43.370]  So I thought about going to the 18 six light schedule.
[16:43.370 --> 16:45.370]  What are your thoughts?
[16:45.370 --> 16:46.370]  I also plan to revenge.
[16:46.370 --> 16:48.370]  This is why I wanted to add this one.
[16:48.370 --> 16:54.370]  It says, I also wanted to revenge a few smaller blant branches and take clones after harvest.
[16:54.370 --> 16:58.370]  Will the 18 six schedule have a negative effect on the clones?
[16:58.370 --> 16:59.370]  Thanks, dude.
[16:59.370 --> 17:01.370]  Peace, love and good health.
[17:01.370 --> 17:05.370]  I don't know if they want their name said, but shout out to our friends, Zach.
[17:06.370 --> 17:07.370]  So that's a great question.
[17:07.370 --> 17:12.370]  We've got two messages about basically the same thing with a couple of different details.
[17:12.370 --> 17:14.370]  So let's talk about this a little bit.
[17:14.370 --> 17:19.370]  What am I talking about when I say turn the timer back on to 18 six at the end of flower?
[17:19.370 --> 17:21.370]  That sounds completely absurd.
[17:21.370 --> 17:25.370]  We've had these plants on 1212 for eight or nine weeks at this point.
[17:25.370 --> 17:33.370]  And I'm saying, turn the timer back to 18 hours on and six hours off for the last seven to 10 days of flower.
[17:33.370 --> 17:35.370]  Now, why would I want to do that to our plants?
[17:35.370 --> 17:37.370]  That is crazy, right?
[17:37.370 --> 17:39.370]  Let's think about what makes our plants grow.
[17:39.370 --> 17:40.370]  What makes our plants grow?
[17:40.370 --> 17:45.370]  The main thing that makes our plants happen, the main source of energy is light.
[17:45.370 --> 17:46.370]  They want that photon energy.
[17:46.370 --> 17:48.370]  They want to photosynthesize.
[17:48.370 --> 17:49.370]  We give them light.
[17:49.370 --> 17:52.370]  They use that light for life energy.
[17:52.370 --> 18:00.370]  So I think by turning the lights on for the last seven to 10 days of flower, we give them more light energy.
[18:00.370 --> 18:02.370]  I feel like the plants beef up.
[18:02.370 --> 18:03.370]  They get bulkier.
[18:03.370 --> 18:04.370]  They get more dense.
[18:04.370 --> 18:07.370]  They kind of ripen up a little bit better.
[18:07.370 --> 18:10.370]  And also, I think the harvest weight is heavier.
[18:10.370 --> 18:12.370]  You're giving them more light hours per day.
[18:12.370 --> 18:16.370]  You're giving them six more hours per day for seven to 10 days.
[18:16.370 --> 18:19.370]  That's up to 60 more hours of light time.
[18:19.370 --> 18:22.370]  I see a lot of growth at the end of the light cycle.
[18:22.370 --> 18:25.370]  A lot of the plants we grow bulk up right at the end.
[18:25.370 --> 18:30.370]  I say don't cut these too early because that last two weeks is when it really packs on the weight.
[18:30.370 --> 18:37.370]  So if we turn that light cycle on to 18-6 during that same bulking period, they get a lot of light energy and they're able to beef up.
[18:37.370 --> 18:41.370]  Now people are going to say aren't they going to, something's going to go wrong.
[18:41.370 --> 18:43.370]  They're going to revege or they're going to start to have problems.
[18:43.370 --> 18:47.370]  No, they're not because in seven to 10 days, we're going to cut them down.
[18:47.370 --> 18:51.370]  We're going to start flushing the same time that we do this light change.
[18:51.370 --> 18:52.370]  Start flushing.
[18:52.370 --> 18:59.370]  Change the light back to 18-6 and pay close attention to the trichomes and pay attention to the top buds of the plants.
[18:59.370 --> 19:03.370]  The minute you see new nubby weird growth coming out of there, harvest.
[19:03.370 --> 19:05.370]  That is your first sign of revege.
[19:05.370 --> 19:07.370]  It is time to cut that plant down.
[19:07.370 --> 19:10.370]  You probably won't see that for 12 to 14 days.
[19:10.370 --> 19:15.370]  Some plants will take 16, 17 days to show you any signs of revege.
[19:15.370 --> 19:22.370]  So I feel like that last 7, 10, 14 days, throw it on 18-6 and they will really beef up at the end.
[19:22.370 --> 19:24.370]  Now the part about turps, where was I?
[19:24.370 --> 19:27.370]  The part about turps and what else does it increase?
[19:27.370 --> 19:28.370]  Smell and taste.
[19:28.370 --> 19:31.370]  I don't think that comes with the 12-12.
[19:31.370 --> 19:35.370]  That is not why I do or that's not why I do the 18-6.
[19:35.370 --> 19:36.370]  I apologize.
[19:36.370 --> 19:41.370]  The reason I do the 18-6 is for denser buds, bigger buds.
[19:41.370 --> 19:45.370]  It basically makes them beef up and they also ripen up more quickly.
[19:45.370 --> 19:46.370]  They're getting more light.
[19:46.370 --> 19:48.370]  They just ripen more quickly.
[19:48.370 --> 19:51.370]  I don't think it has anything to do with aroma and flavor.
[19:51.370 --> 19:57.370]  The turps and aroma and flavor can be increased by harvesting after a long dark period.
[19:57.370 --> 20:01.370]  You don't have to have an extremely long dark period, but if you do a 12-hour dark period,
[20:01.370 --> 20:05.370]  a lot of people like to throw the plants in a 24-hour dark period.
[20:05.370 --> 20:07.370]  That is where you can develop more turps.
[20:07.370 --> 20:12.370]  The daylight, the sun, the light, our bright lights, they break down the turps.
[20:12.370 --> 20:15.370]  The plants produce more terpenes in the dark period.
[20:15.370 --> 20:20.370]  So if you can catch them right before they start photosynthesizing, that is when the most turps are present.
[20:20.370 --> 20:25.370]  So that is the idea behind cutting them down in the dark after an extended dark period.
[20:25.370 --> 20:27.370]  That is where the turps come in.
[20:27.370 --> 20:29.370]  So I think you may have crossed two different things.
[20:29.370 --> 20:32.370]  If not, that is what I think you got that from.
[20:32.370 --> 20:33.370]  That's where that comes from.
[20:33.370 --> 20:38.370]  The 18-6 is more for density, more for faster ripening.
[20:38.370 --> 20:41.370]  So, yes, I do fully encourage, and that is a trick that I kept.
[20:41.370 --> 20:43.370]  I've known that for a little while.
[20:43.370 --> 20:46.370]  A lot of us in the growing industry have known that for a minute.
[20:46.370 --> 20:47.370]  We just keep it under our belts.
[20:47.370 --> 20:48.370]  We don't talk a lot about that.
[20:48.370 --> 20:51.370]  As a breeder, it's a trick that I can use to speed up rooms.
[20:51.370 --> 20:53.370]  I can get more breeding projects going.
[20:53.370 --> 20:54.370]  It really helps me out.
[20:54.370 --> 21:02.370]  But, yes, the last 7 to 10, maybe 14 days, you can turn your light timer back on for 18 hours on and 6 hours off,
[21:02.370 --> 21:05.370]  and it will increase the performance of your plants.
[21:05.370 --> 21:06.370]  You'll get a better harvest weight.
[21:06.370 --> 21:11.370]  You'll get denser buds, and they will ripen up a little bit more quickly under that light cycle.
[21:11.370 --> 21:13.370]  And you should be flushing at that time anyway.
[21:13.370 --> 21:18.370]  So if they do show you any signs of reveg too early, chop them down immediately.
[21:18.370 --> 21:20.370]  Now, there was another part to this question.
[21:21.370 --> 21:25.370]  It said, I want to reveg a few smaller branches and take clones after harvest.
[21:25.370 --> 21:29.370]  Will the 18-6 schedule have a negative effect on the clones?
[21:29.370 --> 21:35.370]  No, the 18-6 schedule will have a wonderful effect on your reveg and your clones.
[21:35.370 --> 21:37.370]  That is exactly what you want.
[21:37.370 --> 21:39.370]  You're giving yourself a head start.
[21:39.370 --> 21:43.370]  Most of the time, people harvest their plants, and they leave a couple of buds,
[21:43.370 --> 21:49.370]  and then they say, now I'm going to reveg these buds, and they put it back under 24 hours or 18-6 of light.
[21:49.370 --> 21:51.370]  You're already 10 days ahead of that.
[21:51.370 --> 21:58.370]  Your plant has been under 18-6 of light for 7, 10, maybe 14 days before you harvested most of the buds.
[21:58.370 --> 21:59.370]  Now you took off the big part.
[21:59.370 --> 22:01.370]  You just left a couple of little buds.
[22:01.370 --> 22:04.370]  Leave like 3 or 4, maybe 5 thumb-sized buds at the bottom.
[22:04.370 --> 22:08.370]  That's all you need to reveg, and they're already having a head start.
[22:08.370 --> 22:12.370]  They're already 7 to 10, 14 days into the reveg process.
[22:12.370 --> 22:17.370]  How we reveg is just by turning the lights back on to a vegetative cycle and patiently waiting.
[22:17.370 --> 22:19.370]  So you've already started that.
[22:19.370 --> 22:20.370]  Now you're flushing.
[22:20.370 --> 22:22.370]  It's about time to cut down.
[22:22.370 --> 22:23.370]  You'll harvest almost everything.
[22:23.370 --> 22:26.370]  Like I said before, leave 3 to 5 little thumb-sized nuggets.
[22:26.370 --> 22:30.370]  Then we want to start feeding a high nitrogen diet again.
[22:30.370 --> 22:32.370]  Go back to your vegetative diet.
[22:32.370 --> 22:35.370]  That will trigger those plants to go back into the vegetative stage.
[22:35.370 --> 22:37.370]  Let them grow.
[22:37.370 --> 22:42.370]  They're going to start spitting out weird dill-looking leaves, like leaves like a dill plant.
[22:42.370 --> 22:45.370]  It's going to be really strange-looking leaves for a little while.
[22:45.370 --> 22:46.370]  They'll be twisted.
[22:46.370 --> 22:47.370]  They'll be claw-like.
[22:47.370 --> 22:48.370]  They'll be different colors.
[22:48.370 --> 22:49.370]  They'll have variegations.
[22:49.370 --> 22:51.370]  There'll be mutations.
[22:51.370 --> 22:56.370]  Then one day, it'll spit out a new shoot that looks like just a fucking baby clone came out of that plant.
[22:56.370 --> 22:58.370]  And you'll feel like you've been blessed.
[22:58.370 --> 22:59.370]  You'll look at it, and you'll go,
[22:59.370 --> 23:02.370]  Ah, it's got this brand-new shoot coming right out of it.
[23:02.370 --> 23:03.370]  Clone that.
[23:03.370 --> 23:04.370]  Let it get big enough.
[23:04.370 --> 23:07.370]  Maybe wait for 2 or 3 of those to happen, and clone those.
[23:07.370 --> 23:09.370]  Make a clone out of that shoot.
[23:09.370 --> 23:11.370]  Let that shoot root.
[23:11.370 --> 23:14.370]  Once that shoot is rooted, pot it, grow it up a little bit.
[23:14.370 --> 23:19.370]  Take clones from that plant and use that one as your clone donor,
[23:19.370 --> 23:20.370]  and now work with those new clones.
[23:20.370 --> 23:22.370]  You want to kind of grow it.
[23:22.370 --> 23:26.370]  Let all those hormones get kind of realigned before we start running that plant again.
[23:26.370 --> 23:27.370]  So cut a clone of it.
[23:27.370 --> 23:29.370]  Grow out that clone.
[23:29.370 --> 23:31.370]  Then use that clone as your new clone donor.
[23:31.370 --> 23:35.370]  It may slow you down a little bit, but in my opinion, that's the best way to preserve the genetics,
[23:35.370 --> 23:39.370]  keep them healthy, and not experience any sort of loss or degradation
[23:39.370 --> 23:42.370]  or the words that we don't use because they're not real anymore.
[23:42.370 --> 23:45.370]  This has been a full podcast episode on the word that I'm not going to use.
[23:45.370 --> 23:46.370]  All right.
[23:46.370 --> 23:47.370]  So I want to thank you.
[23:47.370 --> 23:48.370]  Both my voice is starting to skip.
[23:48.370 --> 23:51.370]  I'm going to grab a drink.
[23:51.370 --> 23:52.370]  All right, guys.
[23:52.370 --> 23:54.370]  Thank you for being patient with me while I hydrated.
[23:54.370 --> 23:59.370]  I want to thank my buddy Zach and my buddy Reggie in my head, both for the great messages.
[23:59.370 --> 24:00.370]  I hope I helped you out.
[24:00.370 --> 24:03.370]  Yes, I do encourage that 18-6 at the end of flower.
[24:03.370 --> 24:09.370]  That will bulk up and beef up your crop, and it will set you on the path for success for a reveg.
[24:09.370 --> 24:11.370]  It's the same thing that we would do in a reveg.
[24:11.370 --> 24:16.370]  You're just cutting down part of the plant when it's ready, leave the rest of it there to grow for you.
[24:16.370 --> 24:18.370]  Then in a couple of weeks, you'll have fresh shoots.
[24:18.370 --> 24:21.370]  A few weeks from there, you'll have brand new plants.
[24:21.370 --> 24:22.370]  All right.
[24:22.370 --> 24:23.370]  I want to thank you guys both for the great message.
[24:23.370 --> 24:26.370]  I look forward to some sort of an update from both of you.
[24:26.370 --> 24:27.370]  How did this work for you?
[24:27.370 --> 24:29.370]  Did you notice a fatter harvest weight?
[24:29.370 --> 24:31.370]  Did you notice a denser bud?
[24:31.370 --> 24:34.370]  Did you notice that things finished up a little bit more quickly for you?
[24:34.370 --> 24:35.370]  Send me some feedback.
[24:35.370 --> 24:36.370]  You've got the email address.
[24:36.370 --> 24:38.370]  I look forward to hearing from you.
[24:38.370 --> 24:43.370]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pimps and hoes, friends and foes, smokers and growers,

[25:42.370 --> 25:44.370]  I need to get some food.
[25:44.370 --> 25:45.370]  I want to thank you again for hanging out.
[25:45.370 --> 25:48.370]  I'll be back in a couple of days with fresh new content.
[25:48.370 --> 25:51.370]  I want to give a huge shout out to my buddy, Reefer Mattness.
[25:51.370 --> 25:55.370]  And until next time, take a fat dab and give your mom a hug for me.
