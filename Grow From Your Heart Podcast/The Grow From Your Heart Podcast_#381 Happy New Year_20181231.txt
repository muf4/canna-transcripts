[00:00.000 --> 00:04.120]  Hey everybody, it's Rasta Jeff and it's time for the New Year's episode of the Grow From
[00:04.120 --> 00:05.480]  Your Heart Podcast.
[00:05.480 --> 00:08.600]  Welcome to episode number 381, thank you for joining me.
[00:08.600 --> 00:12.880]  As always, this episode is brought to you by the Hella Dank Seed Company.
[00:12.880 --> 00:16.680]  That's right, if you need new seeds, you get them from the Hella Dank Seed Company and
[00:16.680 --> 00:22.840]  you can find them at www.dankseed.store.
[00:22.840 --> 00:26.360]  It has become a bit of a tradition that we talk about what I'm dabbing as we start the
[00:26.360 --> 00:27.360]  show.
[00:27.360 --> 00:31.600]  I've been taking dabs of Stardog Ambrosia from Apothecary Farms and I've also been hitting
[00:31.600 --> 00:35.720]  the Copper Chem from Green Dot Labs, a beautiful combination.
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.680]  Both of them have that gassy, fuel-y taste that I love.
[00:38.680 --> 00:40.800]  I've been spoiling myself for the holidays.
[00:40.800 --> 00:43.160]  I hope you're smoking on something delicious also.
[00:43.160 --> 00:46.640]  I hope you've been spending time with great friends and good family and I also hope you
[00:46.640 --> 00:49.760]  got to smoke with somebody new this holiday season.
[00:49.760 --> 00:52.920]  Maybe you got to sneak off with that cool cousin, maybe you finally got one of your
[00:52.920 --> 00:56.840]  brothers or sisters who's always been uptight to finally burn one with you.
[00:57.320 --> 01:00.360]  Maybe, just maybe, you even got grandma to hit the vape pen.
[01:00.360 --> 01:01.360]  You never know.
[01:01.360 --> 01:05.000]  I hope you got to do something cool with your family over this holiday season.
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.480]  I hope you have or had a great, safe New Year whenever you listen to this.
[01:09.480 --> 01:10.840]  I hope everything went well for you.
[01:10.840 --> 01:12.280]  I hope you had a great evening.
[01:12.280 --> 01:16.280]  I hope you got a great New Year's kiss or took a fat New Year's dab and I hope you made
[01:16.280 --> 01:18.280]  it home safely in one piece.
[01:18.280 --> 01:20.800]  Obviously, this is the Happy New Year show.
[01:20.800 --> 01:22.880]  I hope everybody had a happy winter holiday.
[01:22.880 --> 01:26.240]  Whatever holiday you celebrate, I hope it was beautiful and perfect for you.
[01:26.240 --> 01:28.880]  I also hope you have a great, safe New Year.
[01:28.880 --> 01:34.000]  Let's talk about some things we can do with this fresh, new calendar year.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.480]  I like to set goals at the beginning of a year.
[01:36.480 --> 01:40.280]  I feel like setting goals and writing them down really keeps us focused.
[01:40.280 --> 01:41.760]  You can say some goals out loud.
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.440]  You can say, hey, Ross to Jeff, in 2019, I think I want to do this.
[01:46.440 --> 01:50.520]  Then I'm going to give you a fat ass dab and we're going to start talking and in four hours,
[01:50.520 --> 01:54.840]  you'll forget you even talked about a goal or having any sort of goals for the new year.
[01:55.440 --> 01:59.680]  When you're going to set goals, it is my advice to write those goals down.
[01:59.680 --> 02:03.280]  Get a pen, get some paper and write down one goal.
[02:03.280 --> 02:05.960]  If you're really ambitious, write down three goals.
[02:05.960 --> 02:10.320]  If you're a goal-oriented person who likes to crush a to-do list, make a list for 12
[02:10.320 --> 02:13.200]  things and try to get one big thing done every month.
[02:13.200 --> 02:17.020]  If you're a person that's intimidated by goals, get one thing done this year.
[02:17.020 --> 02:21.240]  As long as you write down a goal and you accomplish it, you will feel good about yourself.
[02:21.240 --> 02:23.920]  Once you accomplish a goal, what's the next step?
[02:24.000 --> 02:25.120]  Create a bigger goal.
[02:25.120 --> 02:26.120]  Then what happens?
[02:26.120 --> 02:28.120]  You crush that goal and it continues.
[02:28.120 --> 02:29.640]  Then you start adding to the to-do list.
[02:29.640 --> 02:30.840]  You start getting more confidence.
[02:30.840 --> 02:32.520]  You start getting more things done.
[02:32.520 --> 02:33.520]  You start learning more.
[02:33.520 --> 02:34.880]  You start expanding as a person.
[02:34.880 --> 02:38.440]  Life gets bigger and better and it just expands as things go.
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.320]  It goes exponentially in that pattern.
[02:41.320 --> 02:43.320]  Create a goal, small or large.
[02:43.320 --> 02:44.440]  That is up to you.
[02:44.440 --> 02:46.800]  As long as we have got a goal and we write it down.
[02:46.800 --> 02:48.160]  You can write it down on paper.
[02:48.160 --> 02:50.520]  You can write it down on a Google Drive.
[02:50.520 --> 02:52.680]  You can write it down on a note in your phone.
[02:52.680 --> 02:57.320]  As long as you go and write down that goal and review it occasionally and look at it
[02:57.320 --> 03:00.520]  and think about what you have done to get yourself to that goal.
[03:00.520 --> 03:04.760]  Now, if you want to be really detailed, write down three steps that it would take to get
[03:04.760 --> 03:06.800]  yourself to that goal.
[03:06.800 --> 03:08.960]  Let's say your goal is to walk to the front door.
[03:08.960 --> 03:10.720]  What are the first three steps?
[03:10.720 --> 03:11.720]  Got to stand up.
[03:11.720 --> 03:13.720]  Got to aim myself toward the door.
[03:13.720 --> 03:15.400]  Then I got to take a bunch of steps.
[03:15.400 --> 03:19.080]  That may sound like a small goal, but once you get there, you've accomplished the goal.
[03:19.080 --> 03:20.280]  You've made a clear path.
[03:20.280 --> 03:21.280]  You've gotten there.
[03:21.280 --> 03:22.520]  You've accomplished the goal.
[03:22.560 --> 03:23.560]  Now, what's your next goal?
[03:23.560 --> 03:24.560]  It feels good.
[03:24.560 --> 03:26.040]  You've gotten some shit done.
[03:26.040 --> 03:28.560]  So let's set some goals for the new year.
[03:28.560 --> 03:32.200]  Let's start talking about garden goals we can set.
[03:32.200 --> 03:37.360]  A lot of the people listening to this show keep saying to me in emails or to their girlfriends
[03:37.360 --> 03:42.000]  in conversation or to their bros while they're in their car smoking that they want to start
[03:42.000 --> 03:43.360]  a grow.
[03:43.360 --> 03:46.560]  Why not make this year the year that you start a grow?
[03:46.560 --> 03:48.060]  Write it down.
[03:48.060 --> 03:49.880]  Make it a goal and make it happen.
[03:49.880 --> 03:52.840]  I have given you plenty of advice on how to get it going.
[03:52.840 --> 03:56.260]  It is time to get your shit together and start that grow.
[03:56.260 --> 03:57.260]  Do it, dude.
[03:57.260 --> 03:58.260]  What's stopping you?
[03:58.260 --> 04:01.540]  I know there are a few things that may be stopping several of you, but you keep saying
[04:01.540 --> 04:02.540]  you're going to do it.
[04:02.540 --> 04:04.200]  You're starting to sound silly.
[04:04.200 --> 04:07.680]  Hang up some lights, put some seeds in some dirt, and finally get growing.
[04:07.680 --> 04:08.680]  Make that your goal.
[04:08.680 --> 04:14.200]  Now, if you're already growing, there are plenty of things we can set as garden goals.
[04:14.200 --> 04:16.700]  How about higher potency?
[04:16.700 --> 04:18.860]  How about better yields?
[04:18.860 --> 04:20.540]  How about better scheduling?
[04:20.540 --> 04:23.780]  How about setting a better routine and a better cycle for the grow?
[04:23.780 --> 04:27.740]  How about the day you cut down plants, you've got plants prepared to go into that room so
[04:27.740 --> 04:29.700]  that you never miss a day?
[04:29.700 --> 04:31.720]  How about improving your cleanliness?
[04:31.720 --> 04:35.580]  There are plenty of things we can improve and plenty of goals we can set in the grow
[04:35.580 --> 04:36.580]  room.
[04:36.580 --> 04:37.580]  I don't know what you're doing in your grow.
[04:37.580 --> 04:38.900]  I don't know what you're missing.
[04:38.900 --> 04:39.900]  You do.
[04:39.900 --> 04:41.580]  Think about where you're lacking in the grow.
[04:41.580 --> 04:42.900]  What is your weak point?
[04:42.900 --> 04:44.420]  Are you not a good clone cutter?
[04:44.420 --> 04:45.900]  Are you not good at transplanting?
[04:45.900 --> 04:47.420]  Do you not know how to defoliate?
[04:47.420 --> 04:49.060]  Are you not good at popping and twisting?
[04:49.060 --> 04:51.100]  Do you not know how to work the canopy?
[04:51.100 --> 04:55.140]  Are you not really comfortable mixing up nutrients and getting the pH adjusted?
[04:55.140 --> 04:57.940]  Find your weakness and master that this year.
[04:57.940 --> 04:59.100]  Make that a goal.
[04:59.100 --> 05:02.220]  Maybe find a couple of weaknesses and cover three or four of them.
[05:02.220 --> 05:03.940]  We've got 12 full months.
[05:03.940 --> 05:05.140]  Why not make a goal?
[05:05.140 --> 05:08.940]  If you've got a small goal for every month, and then a good goal for every three months,
[05:08.940 --> 05:13.580]  and then a huge goal for the year, you're really on pace to increase your garden experience
[05:13.580 --> 05:15.740]  and your potential and your learning base.
[05:16.060 --> 05:20.500]  Also, if you just live your life like that, with so many goals and so many different areas,
[05:20.500 --> 05:24.300]  your life will just be fulfilled, and you will be nourished, and you'll be enriched,
[05:24.300 --> 05:27.580]  and you'll be a better person inside and out because of it.
[05:27.580 --> 05:29.300]  Pay attention while you're in the grow.
[05:29.300 --> 05:30.420]  Figure out where you're lacking.
[05:30.420 --> 05:31.660]  What is your weak spot?
[05:31.660 --> 05:36.620]  Make a note of that and make it a conscious effort to improve on that over the next 365
[05:36.620 --> 05:37.620]  days.
[05:37.620 --> 05:41.820]  When we meet next year to talk about this, when you say, man, I really did improve on
[05:41.820 --> 05:46.180]  that, you will have so much pride at how far you have come in one short year.
[05:46.180 --> 05:49.380]  Now, I'm always talking about journaling and keeping notes.
[05:49.380 --> 05:51.580]  This is a good time to take some notes.
[05:51.580 --> 05:55.700]  Start the brand new year with the brand new Grow Journal, and on page one, write some
[05:55.700 --> 05:57.980]  goals on page one.
[05:57.980 --> 06:01.180]  Maybe one major goal, maybe three small goals.
[06:01.180 --> 06:03.380]  Whatever you want to do, make sure you write that down.
[06:03.380 --> 06:05.740]  Say, hey, Ross DeJeff said to create a goal.
[06:05.740 --> 06:06.740]  Here's my goal.
[06:06.740 --> 06:07.740]  It's on paper.
[06:07.740 --> 06:08.740]  It's written down.
[06:08.740 --> 06:09.740]  Now it's a thing.
[06:09.740 --> 06:10.740]  You wrote it down.
[06:10.740 --> 06:11.740]  You've got some accountability.
[06:11.780 --> 06:13.900]  You can look through the rest of the year to take your notes.
[06:13.900 --> 06:17.900]  In one year, open that up to page one and look at your goals and think about it.
[06:17.900 --> 06:19.860]  Have I accomplished those goals?
[06:19.860 --> 06:22.660]  What have I done to get myself closer to those goals?
[06:22.660 --> 06:26.140]  How can I get to that goal if I haven't already gotten there?
[06:26.140 --> 06:30.440]  Now, I mentioned earlier, it's always helpful when you're writing goals to list steps of
[06:30.440 --> 06:32.580]  how you can achieve that goal.
[06:32.580 --> 06:36.860]  When your brain is thinking about the goal, you get inspired, the brain just starts firing,
[06:36.860 --> 06:37.940]  and then you can see the path.
[06:37.940 --> 06:41.380]  If you think about it hard enough, you can actually visualize how to get there.
[06:42.020 --> 06:45.900]  Think about what your goal is, and then maybe write down three steps to help you get there
[06:45.900 --> 06:46.900]  and check once in a while.
[06:46.900 --> 06:49.420]  Am I doing these three steps or am I still stuck?
[06:49.420 --> 06:51.660]  Am I at zero or have I done step one?
[06:51.660 --> 06:55.460]  Have I done step two or have I fucked up and jumped onto step three and missed steps one
[06:55.460 --> 06:58.660]  and two altogether and set myself up for failure in the future?
[06:58.660 --> 07:00.460]  Just pay attention to what your goals are.
[07:00.460 --> 07:04.180]  Pay attention to the steps to get there and don't lose sight of your goal.
[07:04.180 --> 07:06.180]  Now it is fair to change your goal.
[07:06.180 --> 07:09.700]  If you've learned something different, if you get a better idea, you're always learning,
[07:09.700 --> 07:11.300]  you're always expanding.
[07:11.300 --> 07:16.540]  Don't feel stuck to a goal if you learn more and get a better idea, a better thought process.
[07:16.540 --> 07:18.580]  Just make sure it's well thought out.
[07:18.580 --> 07:20.160]  Sometimes we don't know everything.
[07:20.160 --> 07:24.260]  We make a plan, we set a goal, and then we realize, oh, that's not exactly what I thought
[07:24.260 --> 07:25.260]  I was going to do.
[07:25.260 --> 07:26.740]  I need to rethink everything.
[07:26.740 --> 07:30.760]  Don't be afraid to abandon ship and rethink it if that's the appropriate move.
[07:30.760 --> 07:34.160]  Don't puss out and give up just because you get scared, but if you realize you're aiming
[07:34.160 --> 07:37.200]  at the wrong target, you got to adjust, aim for this target over here.
[07:37.200 --> 07:39.340]  Always do that in the grow and in life.
[07:39.340 --> 07:40.900]  That's my advice.
[07:40.900 --> 07:42.380]  So what are your goals this year?
[07:42.380 --> 07:43.700]  What are your goals in life?
[07:43.700 --> 07:45.380]  What are your goals in your garden?
[07:45.380 --> 07:48.820]  Always have goals, always be moving forward, and then you won't get stuck.
[07:48.820 --> 07:53.200]  Once you get stuck in life, once you get stuck in the garden, it is really hard to get unstuck.
[07:53.200 --> 07:57.900]  So it's best just to keep moving forward, never slow down, never stop, never get stuck.
[07:57.900 --> 08:00.100]  Then you never have to pull yourself out of it.
[08:00.100 --> 08:04.420]  The best way to stay motivated is to set a goal, keep crushing those goals.
[08:04.420 --> 08:06.260]  Then you feel that rewarding experience.
[08:06.260 --> 08:07.580]  Then you set a higher goal.
[08:07.580 --> 08:08.720]  Then you stay motivated.
[08:08.720 --> 08:11.840]  You keep reaching those goals and it is a positive cycle.
[08:11.840 --> 08:13.880]  It keeps you set up for success.
[08:13.880 --> 08:17.660]  Set yourself up for success, you guys, in the garden and in your life.
[08:17.660 --> 08:18.840]  This is a grow podcast.
[08:18.840 --> 08:20.340]  Let's focus more on growing cannabis.
[08:20.340 --> 08:22.600]  What are a few goals we can set in our garden?
[08:22.600 --> 08:25.760]  I mentioned earlier that we can increase yields.
[08:25.760 --> 08:28.080]  There are several ways to increase your yields.
[08:28.080 --> 08:29.920]  That starts in the veg phase.
[08:29.920 --> 08:31.800]  You can improve your pH, I bet.
[08:31.800 --> 08:34.840]  You can probably improve the quality of your feeding.
[08:34.840 --> 08:41.000]  You can probably dial in the amount of each nutrient a little more closely per strain.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  Nutrient feedings are very strain specific.
[08:43.000 --> 08:48.200]  Maybe you want to learn your individual cultivars more specifically and build a closer relationship
[08:48.200 --> 08:50.280]  with each plant in your grow.
[08:50.280 --> 08:53.980]  Those are a couple of ways to increase yield during the veg phase.
[08:53.980 --> 08:56.800]  You can also work on cracking and twisting the sticks.
[08:56.800 --> 08:58.280]  You can work on canopy control.
[08:58.280 --> 09:00.340]  You can work on canopy management.
[09:00.340 --> 09:04.240]  Those are a couple of other ways throughout the veg phase you can increase yields.
[09:04.240 --> 09:05.880]  So learn a few things like that.
[09:05.880 --> 09:09.240]  Set goals and learn things to increase the yield.
[09:09.240 --> 09:11.360]  Also we want to increase potency.
[09:11.360 --> 09:16.920]  Not everybody has access to lab testing, but I bet you and your friends and or customers
[09:16.920 --> 09:21.160]  can tell the difference in the quality of the product you started growing and the product
[09:21.160 --> 09:22.300]  you're growing now.
[09:22.300 --> 09:25.720]  They can tell there's a difference in potency and quality.
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.280]  Maybe you can set a goal to make that even better and take a few steps to get it there.
[09:30.280 --> 09:35.420]  The number one thing I bet would improve most of your potency, flavor, and aroma across
[09:35.420 --> 09:40.280]  the board for most growers is learning a better dry and cure technique.
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.600]  I've put out a full episode of drying and curing.
[09:43.600 --> 09:48.360]  If you would like to listen to the drying and curing episode, it is episode 326.
[09:48.360 --> 09:53.460]  Now another goal that I know almost every grower could set and always reach is keeping
[09:53.460 --> 09:57.440]  the grow room just a little bit cleaner than we did last year.
[09:57.440 --> 10:00.200]  Just focus a little bit more on cleanliness.
[10:00.200 --> 10:03.420]  Spend a little bit more time on cleaning up after yourself.
[10:03.420 --> 10:05.880]  It may add 10 minutes to each day.
[10:05.880 --> 10:07.520]  That's about an hour a week.
[10:07.520 --> 10:12.040]  We can all afford one more hour a week to clean up after ourselves because in the long
[10:12.040 --> 10:16.040]  run, imagine how much time you'll save if you don't have to go look for stupid shit
[10:16.040 --> 10:17.320]  all the time.
[10:17.320 --> 10:22.760]  In a large grow, walking from flower room A to the bedroom number one could take several
[10:22.760 --> 10:26.200]  minutes just to walk from one room to the other because in a large grow, we've got a
[10:26.200 --> 10:27.960]  lot of space to cover.
[10:27.960 --> 10:30.200]  Then you've got to go find whatever you lost.
[10:30.200 --> 10:33.280]  Then on the way back, you're going to get distracted and have to do something else.
[10:33.280 --> 10:35.600]  Then the task you were doing just got abandoned.
[10:35.600 --> 10:37.800]  Then you've got to remember, oh yeah, I was over there doing that.
[10:37.800 --> 10:40.440]  That's why I've got scissors in my hand and I'm standing in the wrong place.
[10:40.440 --> 10:43.840]  Now you've got to go get your brain back on track to what you were doing.
[10:43.840 --> 10:47.680]  If you just clean up and put the scissors where they go, put the measuring devices where
[10:47.680 --> 10:52.280]  they go, put the hoses where they go, put the goggles and gloves and spray equipment
[10:52.280 --> 10:56.800]  where it goes and have it cleaned and prepared for the next use, you will save yourself so
[10:56.800 --> 10:58.160]  much time in the garden.
[10:58.160 --> 11:03.160]  So maybe set a goal of being a little more organized and working on cleanliness in your
[11:03.160 --> 11:04.920]  garden this year.
[11:04.920 --> 11:08.960]  These are just a couple of practical ideas I can think of off the top of my head.
[11:08.960 --> 11:10.640]  Everybody wants more potency.
[11:10.640 --> 11:12.760]  Everybody wants more overall product.
[11:12.760 --> 11:16.800]  I've been to a lot of grows and I know that most of us could work on a cleaner grow room
[11:16.800 --> 11:17.920]  environment.
[11:17.920 --> 11:20.400]  Like I said earlier, I don't know where you're lacking in your garden.
[11:20.400 --> 11:22.040]  I don't know what your weak point is.
[11:22.080 --> 11:23.080]  I'm sure you do.
[11:23.520 --> 11:25.000]  So identify that weakness.
[11:25.200 --> 11:26.200]  Let your ego go.
[11:26.320 --> 11:27.920]  Accept that you've got a weakness in the grow.
[11:27.960 --> 11:28.640]  We all do.
[11:28.760 --> 11:31.080]  There's something that every one of us could improve on.
[11:31.320 --> 11:32.600]  I could improve on everything.
[11:32.640 --> 11:34.400]  We can all improve on everything in the grow.
[11:34.440 --> 11:38.400]  It's when you stop thinking you can improve is when you start becoming a shitty grower.
[11:38.640 --> 11:40.040]  So accept your weakness.
[11:40.400 --> 11:41.480]  Embrace your weakness.
[11:41.760 --> 11:47.240]  Then let's find ways to improve on that weakness and make you a rock star grower in
[11:47.240 --> 11:48.280]  all aspects.
[11:48.800 --> 11:52.480]  All right, you guys, I think I've ranted on long enough about goals and setting goals
[11:52.480 --> 11:56.680]  and reaching goals and trying to motivate everybody to have a good positive start to
[11:56.680 --> 12:01.600]  the year. Since it is the start of a new year, there are also some things we could do in
[12:01.600 --> 12:05.720]  the grow to make the grow run more smoothly throughout the rest of the year.
[12:06.160 --> 12:09.520]  Like I mentioned earlier, a little bit of cleanliness and also a little bit of
[12:09.520 --> 12:13.640]  maintenance will make our day to day tasks go much more smoothly.
[12:13.880 --> 12:16.440]  It will also make some of our equipment last longer.
[12:16.640 --> 12:19.960]  We pay a lot of money for high quality equipment in our grows.
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.680]  It would be in our best interest to take care of that equipment.
[12:24.080 --> 12:27.840]  If you have to keep buying a brand new pH meter every couple of months in your grow
[12:27.840 --> 12:31.240]  and you work for a commercial grow, that could have been your Christmas bonus.
[12:31.240 --> 12:35.360]  Possibly think about things like that and you will start taking better care of all of
[12:35.360 --> 12:39.520]  your equipment. I bet if you had to buy all of the tools in your commercial grow, you
[12:39.520 --> 12:41.720]  would probably take a little better care of it.
[12:41.920 --> 12:44.640]  You probably wouldn't wonder where you left those scissors.
[12:44.800 --> 12:47.440]  You probably wouldn't wonder where that pH pen is.
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.160]  If you had to buy it in a commercial grow, I bet you would know where it is.
[12:51.880 --> 12:55.880]  Now let's talk about a few things we can do at the start of the year and probably
[12:55.880 --> 12:59.720]  should do at the start of every month that will help the grow run smoothly.
[13:00.200 --> 13:04.400]  Something I really recommend is that at the start of every month, we clean and
[13:04.400 --> 13:06.360]  calibrate the pH meters.
[13:06.680 --> 13:09.640]  You use that pH meter every time you water the plants.
[13:09.880 --> 13:12.640]  That thing should be cleaned and calibrated very often.
[13:12.640 --> 13:15.760]  You're dipping it into solutions with a bunch of salty junk in there.
[13:15.960 --> 13:17.040]  It's going to get buildup.
[13:17.280 --> 13:18.600]  Then it's getting left somewhere.
[13:18.640 --> 13:20.240]  Who knows where the grow techs are putting it?
[13:20.240 --> 13:22.800]  Hopefully they're putting it back in the solution that keeps it safe.
[13:23.360 --> 13:25.440]  Maybe not. Maybe they're just setting it on the counter.
[13:25.440 --> 13:27.080]  Maybe they're setting it in dirty water.
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.200]  We need to clean that occasionally and make sure that is clean and calibrated.
[13:31.440 --> 13:33.400]  Why not the first of every month?
[13:33.680 --> 13:35.720]  Clean and calibrate your pH meter.
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.840]  Also, if you're using a TDS or an EC meter, clean that at the same time.
[13:41.360 --> 13:46.240]  Now is also a good time to clean and replace your air conditioning filters.
[13:46.240 --> 13:48.600]  Does your air conditioner have a replaceable filter?
[13:48.720 --> 13:52.000]  Does your HVAC system have filtration that needs to be replaced?
[13:52.240 --> 13:56.920]  Now is a very good time to replace all of those things and write it down.
[13:57.120 --> 13:58.200]  Make yourself a note.
[13:58.360 --> 14:02.320]  Hey, I changed all of the air conditioner filters or I cleaned all of the air
[14:02.320 --> 14:04.880]  conditioner filters on January 1st.
[14:05.120 --> 14:06.040]  Now you've got a note.
[14:06.240 --> 14:08.960]  Now when the HVAC tech comes and says, man, this filter is dirty.
[14:08.960 --> 14:10.680]  When is the last time you changed this?
[14:10.960 --> 14:14.440]  You can just hang your head and say, bro, I haven't changed that since January 1st.
[14:14.680 --> 14:18.080]  But right now you probably don't know when the last time it was changed.
[14:18.320 --> 14:20.480]  I would rather have a date than a question mark.
[14:20.480 --> 14:22.320]  So write it down and change that shit.
[14:22.480 --> 14:23.320]  Get it cleaned up.
[14:23.680 --> 14:27.160]  Also, it may be a good time to check on your carbon filter.
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.400]  Is that carbon filter still working or is it just a decoration at this point?
[14:31.840 --> 14:35.000]  You may want to bring somebody that doesn't consume and smell a lot of
[14:35.000 --> 14:39.680]  cannabis and have them walk outside wherever that filter is being blown and
[14:39.680 --> 14:41.080]  just give it a little sniff test.
[14:41.280 --> 14:42.520]  Can they smell your grow?
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.440]  I can't smell my own garden.
[14:44.600 --> 14:48.880]  I can't smell a lot of commercial grows unless it is stanky and pungent.
[14:49.240 --> 14:50.200]  I don't even notice.
[14:50.400 --> 14:53.960]  I'll drive up to places with other people in my car and we'll be a half a block
[14:53.960 --> 14:58.120]  away from some grows and my friends will start going, smells real good here.
[14:58.160 --> 14:59.240]  And I'll say, what are you talking about?
[14:59.240 --> 15:00.440]  Is there a restaurant or something?
[15:00.440 --> 15:02.000]  And they're like, dude, you can't smell that grow.
[15:02.240 --> 15:03.360]  No, I'm immune to it.
[15:03.360 --> 15:07.040]  I've been around so much cannabis that I've got to put my face in it or it's got
[15:07.040 --> 15:09.280]  to be super dank for my nose to even notice.
[15:09.480 --> 15:12.880]  So if you're around your grow all the time, you might not even notice.
[15:13.120 --> 15:16.200]  Some people don't even notice they stink because they stink all day.
[15:16.440 --> 15:19.120]  When someone else comes around and they go, bro, you smell like armpits and
[15:19.120 --> 15:22.000]  onions, they go, oh shit, I didn't even know somebody had to tell them.
[15:22.280 --> 15:23.520]  That's how I feel about a grow.
[15:23.680 --> 15:26.800]  You may not even know that your grow is stinking up the whole block until
[15:26.800 --> 15:27.920]  somebody comes and tells you.
[15:28.520 --> 15:31.440]  Maybe have one of your friends be the one to tell you instead of the
[15:31.440 --> 15:32.960]  neighbors or law enforcement.
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.200]  So is that carbon filter working or has it become a decoration that is just
[15:37.200 --> 15:38.840]  slowing down airflow at this point?
[15:39.080 --> 15:39.680]  Check on that.
[15:39.720 --> 15:41.120]  It may be time to replace it.
[15:41.640 --> 15:45.560]  Again, when you replace it, get a piece of duct tape, write the date on that duct
[15:45.560 --> 15:49.400]  tape and slap it somewhere on that carbon filter so that you know, January 1st,
[15:49.520 --> 15:50.800]  I got a new carbon filter.
[15:51.480 --> 15:55.960]  Now, if you're running an RO machine or some sort of water filter, again, it's
[15:55.960 --> 15:59.960]  a really good time to check and clean and replace those filters.
[16:00.320 --> 16:01.920]  You may think you're filtering your water.
[16:02.080 --> 16:05.400]  You may just be running your water through a bunch of dirty shit and feeding
[16:05.400 --> 16:08.760]  your plants the water you started with and wasting a lot of water.
[16:08.760 --> 16:11.320]  The RO machine spits out a lot of wastewater.
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.080]  If your filters are dirty, it's shooting out a lot of extra wastewater.
[16:15.320 --> 16:16.520]  Water is kind of precious.
[16:16.680 --> 16:17.960]  Water's fucking expensive.
[16:18.120 --> 16:19.720]  People are going to say, water's not expensive.
[16:20.080 --> 16:23.760]  Run a commercial grow, run a hundred gallons of water down the drain and tell
[16:23.760 --> 16:25.080]  me it's not expensive at that point.
[16:25.080 --> 16:27.400]  It makes a difference when you see it in large quantities.
[16:27.640 --> 16:30.360]  It almost hurts your feelings to have to waste that much water.
[16:30.800 --> 16:31.880]  So water is precious.
[16:31.880 --> 16:32.840]  Water is expensive.
[16:32.840 --> 16:33.760]  Water is life.
[16:34.000 --> 16:34.960]  The plants need water.
[16:34.960 --> 16:35.640]  We need water.
[16:35.640 --> 16:36.600]  Everything needs water.
[16:36.840 --> 16:40.000]  So when you waste a lot of water, you're kind of wasting a lot of life source.
[16:40.240 --> 16:42.560]  So clean up all of your water filtration.
[16:42.560 --> 16:44.600]  That way we don't waste a lot of water.
[16:44.600 --> 16:45.320]  That is my point.
[16:45.320 --> 16:46.400]  It's going to reduce your bills.
[16:46.400 --> 16:50.240]  It's going to reduce waste, and it also may increase the health of your plants.
[16:50.640 --> 16:52.320]  You set those filters up for a reason.
[16:52.320 --> 16:53.520]  You're trying to get something out.
[16:53.720 --> 16:56.760]  And if the filters are too dirty, even work, you're just putting in that crap
[16:56.760 --> 16:59.800]  back into the water and running it through the filter, wasting time,
[16:59.960 --> 17:01.680]  wasting water, wasting energy.
[17:01.800 --> 17:03.400]  So clean up your filtration.
[17:03.400 --> 17:07.320]  If you are using water filtration, another thing that probably needs to be
[17:07.320 --> 17:08.880]  cleaned is your reservoir.
[17:09.120 --> 17:12.520]  If you've got a small res that you store your water in, if you've got a gigantic
[17:12.520 --> 17:15.880]  resin, which you store your water, it probably needs a scrub in.
[17:16.160 --> 17:19.440]  I would dry it out, drain it, dry it, let it dry completely.
[17:19.800 --> 17:21.800]  Then I would get some sort of a cleaning product.
[17:21.800 --> 17:23.320]  I like to use Fizan 20.
[17:23.680 --> 17:28.280]  I would mix about 15 to 20 milliliters of Fizan 20 in a gallon of water.
[17:28.280 --> 17:30.400]  And I would use that like a cleaning solution.
[17:30.400 --> 17:33.960]  I dip it into a rag and just scrub the inside of my reservoir.
[17:34.000 --> 17:38.200]  Wear gloves when you were using the Fizan 20, please wear gloves when you're using
[17:38.200 --> 17:40.200]  the Fizan, maybe even use goggles.
[17:40.600 --> 17:44.400]  I don't know the recommended PPE for Fizan, but I would certainly wear gloves
[17:44.400 --> 17:47.240]  and I would probably put on goggles just to be safe.
[17:47.520 --> 17:50.160]  So clean the reservoir, then rinse it out.
[17:50.400 --> 17:52.120]  You don't want any Fizan left in there.
[17:52.560 --> 17:55.480]  You'll know if it's left because it makes a lot of bubbles and it has a very
[17:55.480 --> 17:56.600]  distinct smell.
[17:56.800 --> 17:59.800]  So get rid of the bubbles, get rid of the Fizan, rinse that out real good.
[17:59.800 --> 18:02.480]  Now your reservoir is nice and clean and disinfected.
[18:02.480 --> 18:03.880]  Now you can go back to business.
[18:04.560 --> 18:07.840]  Here we go again, get a piece of duct tape, write down the date, right?
[18:07.880 --> 18:12.880]  I cleaned this reservoir on January 1st, 2019 and stick that on there.
[18:13.160 --> 18:16.280]  Then every time you see that, if it's been a couple of months, it'll start to bug
[18:16.280 --> 18:18.120]  you. You'll go, man, I haven't cleaned that in a long time.
[18:18.120 --> 18:19.480]  It's probably getting pretty grody.
[18:19.560 --> 18:21.120]  And you're right. It's getting grody in there.
[18:21.360 --> 18:24.080]  There's funk building up in there that will start affecting the health of your
[18:24.080 --> 18:29.360]  plants. So now that we are cleaning the tank, if you've got any sort of hydro
[18:29.440 --> 18:32.520]  lines, if you're in a commercial environment and you were running a feed
[18:32.520 --> 18:37.160]  system, a drip system, an auto water system, also known as a fertigation system,
[18:37.160 --> 18:38.880]  you guys, that's another word for the glossary.
[18:39.200 --> 18:41.960]  It may be a good time to clean out all of those lines.
[18:42.000 --> 18:44.000]  Also a good time to clean the pumps.
[18:44.280 --> 18:48.400]  You can use that same Fizan and water solution, run that through your pumps.
[18:48.400 --> 18:49.800]  You can soak the pumps right in it.
[18:49.840 --> 18:53.320]  I don't think it's too corrosive to where it's going to damage your pump, but it
[18:53.320 --> 18:55.360]  will take off all the algae and all the funk.
[18:55.680 --> 18:57.840]  Take that pump apart as far as you can.
[18:58.120 --> 19:00.120]  Submerge that in the Fizan solution.
[19:00.280 --> 19:03.360]  Take it out, give it a good scrub, and you may need to hit it with a scrub brush
[19:03.360 --> 19:05.120]  and a toothbrush. That's just fine.
[19:05.120 --> 19:07.600]  Clean up your pump, rinse it out real well.
[19:07.600 --> 19:10.040]  So there's no Fizan solution back left in there.
[19:10.200 --> 19:12.120]  Clean it out, set it aside, let it dry.
[19:12.360 --> 19:13.640]  Clean out the rest of the lines.
[19:13.680 --> 19:15.960]  Run that Fizan water through your hydro lines.
[19:15.960 --> 19:20.120]  If you can clean it out really well, it is always a good idea when you're building
[19:20.120 --> 19:24.480]  a drip system to put a ball valve at the end of it so that you can run water right
[19:24.480 --> 19:26.760]  through there and just clean out that whole system.
[19:27.040 --> 19:30.000]  So if you haven't done that, that may be a good addition in the future.
[19:30.160 --> 19:34.560]  That may be a good idea for your next auto watering or assisted watering project.
[19:34.840 --> 19:36.120]  We want to clean out those lines.
[19:36.120 --> 19:38.680]  We don't want to let a bunch of funk build up in there.
[19:38.960 --> 19:44.360]  I've seen a lot of nasty shit build up in the fertigation lines, in the long PVC
[19:44.360 --> 19:47.240]  tubes, in the black poly tubes, in the skinny poly tubes.
[19:47.480 --> 19:51.360]  I've seen slimy, moldy, stinky shit come out of there that you do not want to feed
[19:51.360 --> 19:53.440]  your plants. So clean that up.
[19:53.440 --> 19:56.720]  A little bit of Fizan, a little bit of warm water will go a long way.
[19:56.960 --> 19:58.600]  In cleaning your hydro setup.
[19:58.880 --> 20:02.320]  Now one more thing I want to talk about specifically is our bulbs.
[20:02.520 --> 20:06.720]  How long have you been running your bulbs in your veg and your flower area?
[20:07.000 --> 20:08.840]  Is it time to swap out your bulbs?
[20:09.440 --> 20:13.200]  Depending on the quality of the bulbs you purchased, depending on the light cycle
[20:13.200 --> 20:17.240]  you chose to run, depending on your ballast, there are so many different factors
[20:17.240 --> 20:21.240]  that determine it. But over time, your bulbs have slowly stopped putting out as
[20:21.240 --> 20:24.920]  much light, but they are still consuming as much electricity.
[20:25.160 --> 20:29.720]  So it is always a good idea to consider a bulb change every couple of harvests,
[20:29.880 --> 20:31.840]  depending again on your bulb strength.
[20:31.840 --> 20:34.560]  Are you running a thousand, a six or a 400 watt bulb?
[20:34.840 --> 20:37.640]  Did you buy cheap bulbs or did you buy good expensive bulbs?
[20:37.960 --> 20:42.320]  If you bought those lesser expensive bulbs, you may want to swap them every grow.
[20:42.560 --> 20:46.320]  If you bought good expensive bulbs, you may want to run those two or three grows
[20:46.320 --> 20:47.640]  before you swap them out.
[20:48.120 --> 20:49.800]  I understand that bulbs are expensive.
[20:49.800 --> 20:53.000]  You're going to want to push those bulbs as many grows as you can, just so that
[20:53.040 --> 20:55.600]  you can maximize your output with the equipment you've got.
[20:55.840 --> 20:59.320]  But keep in mind, you may be shooting a hundred percent of the electricity into
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.320]  that bulb and only getting 50% of the lumens that you're expecting.
[21:03.480 --> 21:07.200]  So you're paying for a hundred percent of that light to come out and only 50% of
[21:07.200 --> 21:12.160]  it is coming out. It probably costs around a hundred dollars a month to run a
[21:12.160 --> 21:17.040]  high pressure sodium bulb. For that $100 a month for the next two months,
[21:17.040 --> 21:21.640]  which is going to be $200 worth of electricity, you're only going to put $100
[21:21.680 --> 21:24.080]  worth of electricity onto those plants.
[21:24.560 --> 21:29.240]  So there's already $100 worth of electricity that you basically didn't do
[21:29.240 --> 21:32.240]  anything with. It got lost somewhere down the line.
[21:32.240 --> 21:34.840]  It went through the electrical wires. It went down through the red,
[21:34.840 --> 21:36.680]  through the white, through the black, and then it hits your bulb.
[21:36.680 --> 21:39.480]  And it just stopped. It didn't come out of the bulb. You paid for it.
[21:39.680 --> 21:43.040]  You didn't get it. Eventually you'll need to make a business decision.
[21:43.360 --> 21:47.280]  Do you want to keep paying for electricity to come down the wires and just not
[21:47.280 --> 21:48.760]  happen? It doesn't go anywhere.
[21:48.840 --> 21:52.800]  Or do you want to replace that bulb that may cost you 50 to a hundred,
[21:52.800 --> 21:56.120]  maybe 120 bucks for a really high end, high pressure sodium bulb,
[21:56.400 --> 21:59.760]  swap out the bulb and actually get all of the electricity you're paying for.
[22:00.040 --> 22:01.440]  You're paying for that electricity.
[22:01.680 --> 22:03.840]  I do know that that other bulb costs you more money,
[22:04.120 --> 22:06.960]  but you're going to spend the money on electricity either way.
[22:07.240 --> 22:11.400]  So if you think about the math, once that bulb diminishes to approximately 70,
[22:11.520 --> 22:13.480]  60, definitely 50%,
[22:13.840 --> 22:17.320]  you're paying for a hundred percent of the electricity and you were getting 50%
[22:17.360 --> 22:18.200]  of the outcome.
[22:18.240 --> 22:20.920]  So you're spending 200 bucks and you're getting a hundred bucks worth of light.
[22:21.280 --> 22:24.560]  You could go buy another bulb, which will probably cost you a hundred.
[22:24.720 --> 22:26.040]  So now you're spending 300.
[22:26.040 --> 22:29.000]  You've got 200 on electricity and another hundred on the bulb.
[22:29.120 --> 22:31.000]  And you were getting 100%,
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.600]  probably 110% compared to what you were getting,
[22:33.960 --> 22:38.440]  110% of the output and your plants are really going to show you a difference.
[22:38.760 --> 22:40.480]  And if you can wait till harvest time,
[22:40.680 --> 22:43.720]  it will be worth it if you do the mathematical equation.
[22:43.920 --> 22:45.960]  So it's a good time to check on your bulbs.
[22:46.120 --> 22:49.320]  It's a good time to consider swapping your bulbs. And here we go again.
[22:49.320 --> 22:52.160]  When you swap that bulb, get some sort of sticky note,
[22:52.200 --> 22:54.280]  get some sort of duct tape, write down.
[22:54.480 --> 22:58.240]  I changed this bulb on January 1st, 2019.
[22:58.440 --> 23:00.080]  That way you know when the bulbs are fresh,
[23:00.320 --> 23:02.800]  that when they start flickering or when they don't look as bright as they used
[23:02.800 --> 23:05.520]  to be, you could say, Oh yeah, that thing's been in there for two months.
[23:05.640 --> 23:06.960]  Thing's been in there for three months.
[23:07.160 --> 23:11.640]  It's probably time to invest some of my grow money back into itself and replace
[23:11.720 --> 23:12.560]  that bulb.
[23:13.000 --> 23:17.040]  Often I talk about using a string and a lumen meter to determine when to replace
[23:17.040 --> 23:19.320]  your bulbs. I will try to go over that really quickly.
[23:19.920 --> 23:22.560]  Get something that is a consistent length. You can use a tape measure.
[23:22.720 --> 23:25.680]  If you have one, you can use a piece of string. If that is more handy,
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.880]  then you can purchase or borrow a lumen meter. They are quite expensive.
[23:30.120 --> 23:32.840]  A lot of the growth stores will loan you a lumen meter.
[23:32.840 --> 23:35.840]  If you've got a local friendly shop, they like to loan them to you.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.440]  That way they know that you're going to come by a bulb when it gets too low.
[23:39.440 --> 23:43.040]  So get a lumen meter, get a brand new bulb, fire that bulb up,
[23:43.280 --> 23:45.280]  give it a little bit to get to its maximum shine.
[23:45.280 --> 23:47.200]  It takes these grow lights a few minutes to warm up,
[23:47.200 --> 23:48.400]  to get to their full potential.
[23:48.640 --> 23:51.560]  Give it maybe 30 or 40 minutes to get warm, get it shining.
[23:51.960 --> 23:56.200]  Measure a distance from that bulb, maybe 12, 16, 18 inches away.
[23:56.400 --> 23:59.760]  Then set up your lumen meter and measure the amount of lumens that you're
[23:59.760 --> 24:03.480]  receiving on the meter right there. Write it down. On day one,
[24:03.560 --> 24:07.960]  I was receiving this many meter or this many lumens at this distance away on
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  this meter from this bulb. Try to remember where you were,
[24:11.480 --> 24:14.720]  like right in the center of the bulb, 18 inches away, write that down,
[24:14.720 --> 24:16.200]  but try to remember kind of where you were visually.
[24:16.200 --> 24:18.000]  Like you're going to have to line that up and do it again,
[24:18.320 --> 24:21.080]  or make a mental note of where you were physically in the room and how you were
[24:21.080 --> 24:25.080]  doing it. Because we're going to do that again, about every 30 days,
[24:25.280 --> 24:27.240]  we're going to do it again in 30 days and make a note.
[24:27.440 --> 24:30.160]  How many lumens are coming out? Then we're going to do it at 45.
[24:30.160 --> 24:32.720]  Then we'll do it at 60. Then let's do it at 75.
[24:32.720 --> 24:36.720]  Then let's do it at 90 days and see how that bulb reduces an output.
[24:37.080 --> 24:42.040]  When it gets to, like I said earlier, 70, 60, absolutely by 50%,
[24:42.040 --> 24:43.080]  you want to swap it out.
[24:43.360 --> 24:46.800]  That is a really good way to determine when to swap out your bulbs.
[24:47.040 --> 24:50.600]  And that is also a really good way to see how much electricity you are actually
[24:50.600 --> 24:54.400]  wasting. That bulb says a thousand Watts, but over time, you know,
[24:54.400 --> 24:56.080]  it's only putting out 700 now.
[24:56.200 --> 24:59.360]  So you're getting 300 Watts that are just going out to nowhere and you're paying
[24:59.380 --> 24:59.920]  for it.
[24:59.920 --> 25:03.720]  If you don't have a bulb that can actually put out the electricity you're pumping
[25:03.720 --> 25:08.120]  into it, to be quite honest with you in a commercial grow environment,
[25:08.520 --> 25:13.240]  the bulbs and the flowering rooms are the number one hardest thing for
[25:13.260 --> 25:17.760]  me to convince an owner. We need to spend money on to replace.
[25:18.120 --> 25:21.480]  I will tell an owner, those bulbs have been in there for six months.
[25:21.680 --> 25:24.080]  It is probably time to change them. Keep in mind,
[25:24.080 --> 25:27.800]  there's probably 50 1000 watt double ended bulbs in this room.
[25:27.800 --> 25:31.880]  So it's going to be quite an investment, but I say we need 50 new bulbs.
[25:32.240 --> 25:33.680]  They usually walk into the room.
[25:34.120 --> 25:36.160]  They put their hand over their eyes like it's a visor.
[25:36.360 --> 25:38.200]  They look up into the lights and they say,
[25:38.480 --> 25:42.520]  it still looks really bright to me and they don't believe me that those lights
[25:42.520 --> 25:46.520]  are only putting out 50% of the electricity they are receiving.
[25:47.360 --> 25:48.880]  Then when harvest time comes,
[25:49.040 --> 25:53.360]  they complain that the yields are not what they were two months ago.
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.280]  You know why? Because those bulbs are not putting out the lumens.
[25:57.480 --> 26:00.800]  We think they're putting out and they refuse to change the bulbs.
[26:01.320 --> 26:05.600]  Usually it only takes one or two harvests of low productivity before they
[26:05.600 --> 26:07.240]  realize this guy is right.
[26:07.480 --> 26:10.080]  We need to spend the money on brand new bulbs in that grow.
[26:10.640 --> 26:15.200]  Also think about this light is the number one source of energy for our plants.
[26:15.440 --> 26:18.280]  Yes, they do want water. Yes, they do want air. Yes,
[26:18.280 --> 26:19.480]  they do need some nutrients,
[26:19.680 --> 26:22.760]  but the light they receive is that our number one source of life.
[26:22.800 --> 26:24.360]  That is what makes them thrive.
[26:24.760 --> 26:28.960]  So why wouldn't we do our best to give them the most light we can afford to give
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.280]  them in the environment we've put them in?
[26:31.720 --> 26:34.800]  And I don't mean go try to stick a thousand watt bulb in a closet.
[26:35.080 --> 26:38.600]  I just mean why not maximize our potential? If you've got a closet,
[26:38.600 --> 26:42.080]  put the biggest bulb you can get in that closet, put a three 15 in there.
[26:42.080 --> 26:45.960]  If you think you can handle it. But when that three 15 bulb starts to dim out,
[26:45.960 --> 26:49.080]  starts reducing its output, make sure you replace it.
[26:49.080 --> 26:53.120]  That way you can maximize the potential of your gross space and your grow light,
[26:53.360 --> 26:56.840]  no matter the size of your space. All right, podcast rule.
[26:56.840 --> 27:00.320]  That is my new year's rant. I do have one more thing I would like to say.
[27:00.600 --> 27:01.680]  I would like to thank you.
[27:01.680 --> 27:04.360]  I'd like to thank everybody for listening to the podcast.
[27:04.360 --> 27:06.280]  I would like to thank you for all of the support.
[27:06.520 --> 27:08.640]  I'd like to thank you for all of the interaction.
[27:08.960 --> 27:10.560]  If you were listening to the podcast,
[27:10.560 --> 27:13.520]  if you were supporting the podcast in any way, thank you.
[27:13.520 --> 27:17.640]  If you're listening on iTunes, Stitcher, Google play, wherever you're listening,
[27:17.640 --> 27:20.280]  thank you. If you are a YouTube subscriber, thank you.
[27:20.280 --> 27:23.640]  If you have ever left a comment or words of encouragement, thank you.
[27:23.920 --> 27:28.240]  Also, if you've contributed to the show on Patreon, I owe you a huge high five,
[27:28.440 --> 27:31.640]  maybe even a bro hug and a huge thank you for all of the support.
[27:32.080 --> 27:35.280]  Thank you for listening to the show. Thank you for all of the feedback.
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.440]  And thank you for trusting me with your garden.
[27:38.440 --> 27:41.040]  I understand that those plants are your babies.
[27:41.240 --> 27:45.680]  I understand you have invested a lot of money and time and personal energy,
[27:45.840 --> 27:47.960]  and you've got a lot of hopes and dreams for that garden.
[27:48.120 --> 27:51.640]  And I understand that a lot of you rely on me to keep that garden going.
[27:52.040 --> 27:56.360]  So thank you for the trust and thank you for believing in me and knowing that I
[27:56.360 --> 27:57.640]  would never steer you wrong.
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.320]  And that all I want to do is make you the best grower that you can be so that we
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.000]  can all grow the best cannabis we can grow.
[28:05.320 --> 28:08.000]  That way we've got all the medicine we need for sick people.
[28:08.120 --> 28:11.200]  We've got all the recreational cannabis we need for people that just want to
[28:11.200 --> 28:12.640]  recreate and have a good time.
[28:12.960 --> 28:15.720]  I want everybody to be a rockstar in the grow room.
[28:15.920 --> 28:19.240]  I want everybody who wants to learn about cannabis to be able to learn about
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.040]  cannabis from a person who has experience and passion with cannabis.
[28:23.040 --> 28:25.880]  You can learn a lot from books, but to be quite honest with you,
[28:25.880 --> 28:29.360]  a lot of the stuff I learned in books really looks good on paper.
[28:30.120 --> 28:32.840]  It doesn't really pan out in a large scale grow environment.
[28:33.200 --> 28:35.480]  So I'm here to teach you in a way that actually works.
[28:35.600 --> 28:39.560]  I'm here to teach you ways that I have tested and put to use in small grows,
[28:39.760 --> 28:42.720]  large grows, commercial grows, private grows.
[28:43.040 --> 28:45.640]  I just want to share all of my knowledge with you guys. And again,
[28:45.760 --> 28:49.000]  I really appreciate you for following along, for supporting me,
[28:49.120 --> 28:52.960]  for trusting in me and believing in me. And also thanks for listening to me rant.
[28:52.960 --> 28:54.280]  You guys, I know I get long winded,
[28:54.440 --> 28:58.000]  but sometimes you got to explain shit at multiple angles for different people to
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.560]  understand. So thanks for joining in. Thanks for listening.
[29:00.760 --> 29:04.000]  Thanks for being so supportive and thanks for being a big part of what has
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.200]  become the Irie army. I appreciate each and every one of you. All right,
[29:08.200 --> 29:10.160]  you guys, here's where I start wrapping up the show.
[29:10.360 --> 29:14.000]  If you feel like this podcast was educational, informative, or entertaining,
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.640]  and you would like to make a financial contribution to the show,
[29:16.880 --> 29:21.440]  you can do so by going to patreon.com slash grow from your heart.
[29:21.440 --> 29:26.440]  That is P A T R E O N.com slash grow from your heart.
[29:27.360 --> 29:30.400]  All of the information you need to sign up and become a patron will be right
[29:30.400 --> 29:33.920]  there on the screen. Again, I do appreciate all of the Patreon support.
[29:34.120 --> 29:37.160]  What I do with those Patreon contributions is I pay for the website.
[29:37.200 --> 29:41.040]  I host the podcast on my website, Iriegeneticscolorado.com.
[29:41.360 --> 29:43.960]  It does cost a little bit of money to host the podcast there.
[29:44.200 --> 29:47.800]  I pay for that website with those Patreon contributions. Also,
[29:47.800 --> 29:51.920]  I did use the Patreon contributions to replace the Mac book on which I record
[29:51.920 --> 29:54.520]  the podcast. The old Mac book kind of took a crap on me.
[29:54.800 --> 29:58.040]  I bought a new one with the help of my Patreon supporters. So again,
[29:58.040 --> 30:01.360]  big thank you to everyone who supports the show on Patreon.
[30:01.560 --> 30:03.040]  That is where your funding is going.
[30:03.280 --> 30:06.920]  It also goes to replace these microphone covers so that when Mike comes over and
[30:06.920 --> 30:09.120]  Deb and granny come over and Jesse comes over,
[30:09.120 --> 30:11.400]  they're not all spitting into the same microphone cover.
[30:11.560 --> 30:14.280]  So it doesn't smell like Jesse when granny's here and it doesn't smell like
[30:14.280 --> 30:17.320]  granny when Jesse's here. Those are the types of things that you're covering.
[30:17.320 --> 30:20.280]  Also I put water bottles on the table for each of the guests.
[30:20.520 --> 30:23.600]  Small things like that are covered by the Patreon contributions.
[30:23.760 --> 30:26.160]  So that is hugely appreciated not only by myself,
[30:26.160 --> 30:29.480]  but by the people who don't have to smell other folks breath on their microphone
[30:29.480 --> 30:30.240]  covers.

[30:34.400 --> 30:38.680]  campaign. I would also appreciate it if you stalk me on all of the social media,

[32:17.080 --> 32:20.480]  I want to give a huge shout out to my friend Aldridge. And until next time,
